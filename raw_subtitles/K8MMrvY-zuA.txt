Hey
 there,
 it's
 Christine.
 This
 season


we're
 dropping
 a
 series
 of
 giftgiving


episodes.
 You
 should
 check
 out
 the
 last


one
 that
 we
 dropped
 all
 about
 gift


suggestions
 from
 our
 expert
 staff.
 These


are
 items
 that
 they
 really
 loved
 in


2025.
 [music]


And
 you
 know,
 it's
 their
 job
 to
 find


great
 stuff.
 So,
 everything
 is
 awesome


in
 that
 episode.
 Today
 we're
 focusing
 on


[music]


potentially
 one
 of
 the
 most
 challenging


scenarios
 in
 the
 giftgiving
 world
 and


that
 is
 people
 who
 are
 hard
 to
 shop


[music]
 for.
 We
 all
 probably
 have


someone
 like
 this
 in
 our
 lives.
 Maybe


it's
 somebody
 who's
 really
 picky
 or
 they


have
 really
 excellent
 taste
 or
 maybe


they
 just
 never
 seem
 to
 be
 quite
 happy


with
 what
 you've
 given
 them.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 take
 on
 this
 challenge
 [music]


today
 and
 try
 to
 come
 up
 with
 great


ideas
 for
 people
 who
 are
 hard
 to
 please.


Whatever
 the
 conundrum,
 Wire
 Cutter


usually
 has
 someone
 on
 staff
 who
 can


help.
 And
 in
 this
 case,
 we
 have
 the


perfect
 person.
 Hannah
 Moral
 is
 a


supervising
 editor
 on
 our
 gifts
 team.


She
 joined
 us
 last
 year
 to
 talk
 about


affordable
 gifts.
 And
 today,
 she's
 going


to
 answer
 your
 questions
 about
 what
 to


get
 people
 who
 are
 just
 really


challenging
 to
 buy
 gifts
 for.
 [music]


Stay
 tuned
 to
 hear
 Hannah's
 expert


advice
 to
 get
 great
 gifts
 that
 will


impress.
 Be
 right
 back.


>> [music]


[music]


[music]


>> Welcome
 back.
 I'm
 here
 with
 Hannah


Moral,
 supervising
 editor
 of
 gifts


coverage
 at
 Wire
 Cutter.
 Hannah
 leads
 a


team
 of
 gift
 writers
 who
 spend
 all
 year


searching
 high
 and
 low
 for
 amazing


gifts.
 They
 look
 on
 the
 internet.
 They


look
 in
 real
 life.
 They
 scour
 Wire


Cutters
 other
 product
 recommendations
 to


handpick
 items
 that
 they
 think
 will
 make


great
 gifts.
 Welcome
 to
 the
 show,


Hannah.


>> Thank
 you,
 Christine.


>> It's
 so
 great
 to
 have
 you.
 Okay,
 so
 if


somebody
 is
 thinking
 about
 a
 particular


person
 that
 they
 want
 to
 buy
 a
 gift
 for,


they
 know
 that
 they're
 hard
 to
 please.


They're
 going
 to
 start
 the
 shopping


journey.
 What
 are
 the
 sort
 of
 questions


that
 you
 recommend
 people
 ask
 themselves


or
 you
 know
 maybe
 some
 parameters
 that


people
 can
 use?


>> I
 really
 try
 to
 think
 back
 on
 my


relationship
 with
 the
 person
 as
 of
 late


and
 think
 about
 like
 conversations
 we've


had
 or
 texts
 we've
 exchanged
 or
 links


they've
 sent
 me
 and
 things
 that
 have


sort
 of
 like
 energized
 them
 in
 the
 most


recent
 correspondence
 that
 we've
 had


together.
 My
 friend
 Lee
 is
 always


texting
 me
 stuff
 about
 jewelry,
 right?


She's
 always
 like,
 "Do
 you
 like
 this?
 Do


you
 like
 this?
 How
 [laughter]
 about


this?
 What
 about
 that?


>> Is
 she
 Is
 she
 dropping
 your
 hints?"
 So


like
 I'm
 like
 but
 she
 just
 that's
 like


an
 interest
 for
 her
 right
 she
 has
 a
 lot


of
 energy
 around
 that
 you
 know
 my


partner
 the
 only
 thing
 I
 can
 get
 him
 to


like
 really
 engage
 with
 me
 on


conversation
 these
 days
 is
 about
 his


garden
 like
 that
 is
 you
 will
 see
 no
 one


more
 enlivened
 than
 Jim
 when
 his
 garden


is
 at
 hand
 people
 give
 you
 hints
 people


tell
 you
 you
 know
 what
 is
 it
 that


they're
 interested
 and
 then
 that
 sort
 of


helps
 me
 to
 like
 narrow
 in
 on
 okay
 Jim's


feeling
 this
 garden
 moment
 how
 can
 I


support
 that
 how
 can
 I
 acknowledge
 that


how
 can
 I
 like
 show
 that
 I've
 been
 like


listening
 to
 you
 over
 the
 past
 year
 or


whatever
 And
 you'd
 be
 surprised
 even


people
 that
 you're
 not
 in
 touch
 with
 so


much.
 I
 think
 people
 do
 tell
 you
 what


they're
 interested
 in
 and
 tell
 you
 where


their
 hearts
 sort
 of
 lie
 at
 the
 moment.


>> That's
 so
 thoughtful.
 I
 think
 that's


just
 a
 good
 general
 tip,
 right,
 for
 any


gift
 giving
 to
 be
 thoughtful.


>> All right,
 so
 this
 is
 where
 we
 get
 into


the
 really
 fun
 part
 of
 this
 episode.
 We


have
 some
 listener
 questions.
 Oh,
 I
 love


these.
 I
 I
 know
 you
 do
 and
 I
 know
 you're


going
 to
 have
 some
 great
 suggestions
 for


these
 folks.
 So,
 let's
 listen
 to
 this


first
 question
 from
 Sue.
 [music]


Hi,
 wire
 cutter.
 I
 would
 love
 to
 have


some
 gift
 suggestions
 for
 my
 daughter.


My
 daughter
 is
 an
 Olympic
 sailor.
 She


sailed
 at
 Tokyo
 and
 Paris
 and
 is
 hoping


to
 qualify
 for
 Los
 Angeles.
 She
 doesn't


like
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 She
 doesn't
 like
 a


lot
 of
 stuff
 because
 she
 has
 a
 small


apartment
 and
 she's
 traveling
 a
 lot.
 She


travels
 and
 sails
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 foreign


countries.
 So,
 she's
 got
 access
 to
 all


that.
 And
 I
 certainly
 can't
 afford
 to


buy
 her
 a
 new
 boat.
 So,
 I'd
 love
 some


suggestions.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Sue,
 your
 daughter
 is
 fascinating.
 I
 I


kind
 of
 want
 to
 live
 her
 life
 and
 I
 hope


my
 daughter
 is
 [laughter]
 sailing
 the


world
 in
 18
 years.


>> Okay.
 So
 Sue's
 daughter
 is
 an
 athlete,


travels
 a
 ton,
 very
 into
 sailing,
 does


not
 have
 much
 space.
 What
 are
 some


things
 that
 come
 to
 mind?


>> The
 first
 thing
 that
 came
 to
 mind
 for
 me


was
 I've
 done
 this
 with
 this
 family


cottage
 we
 have
 is
 commission
 a
 little


portrait
 of
 her
 boat.
 Um,
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 maybe
 a
 really
 special
 boat
 to
 her


that
 she
 won
 a
 big
 race
 on
 or
 just
 maybe


her
 first
 boat.
 I'm
 sure
 you
 have
 some


photographs
 kicking
 around.
 And
 there's


this
 service
 called
 My
 Da
 Vinci
 and
 the


website
 looks
 like
 it
 hasn't
 been


updated
 since
 1996,
 but
 the
 service
 is


incredible.
 They
 like
 sort
 of
 employ


this
 stable
 of
 artists.
 You
 can
 choose


watercolor
 or
 charcoal,
 whatever
 your


vibe
 is.
 And
 within
 I
 mean,
 I
 feel
 like


I
 got
 mine
 in
 36
 hours.
 you'll
 get
 a


proof
 of
 this
 portrait
 of
 your
 I
 did


like
 I
 said
 I
 did
 a
 cabin
 but
 you
 could


do
 her
 boat
 and
 you
 could
 give
 feedback


like
 oh
 you
 know
 um
 there
 was
 sort
 of


like
 bushes
 that
 were
 over
 rot
 or


whatever
 and
 I
 sort
 of
 gave
 that


feedback
 they
 adjusted
 a
 little
 bit
 and


then
 2
 weeks
 later
 or
 a
 week
 later
 I
 got


this
 like
 beautiful
 watercolor
 portrait


of
 a
 family
 cabin
 that's
 like
 so


treasured
 now.
 So
 I
 feel
 like
 that
 would


be
 great
 for
 your
 daughter
 and
 it


doesn't
 take
 up
 a
 ton
 of
 space.
 You


could
 frame
 it.
 The
 cool
 thing
 is
 you


also
 get
 a
 digital
 proof
 of
 it.
 So
 like


you
 could
 use
 that
 on
 like
 you
 could


make
 her
 a
 set
 of
 postcards
 or
 you
 could


use
 that
 image
 elsewhere
 in
 your
 life


after
 you
 give
 her
 the
 original.
 That's


one
 idea.


>> Great.
 I
 love
 that.
 Okay.
 Any
 other


ideas
 for
 Sue?


>> I
 guess
 it
 also
 comes
 to
 mind
 like
 her


traveling
 so
 much
 and
 being
 just
 sort
 of


almost
 living
 out
 of
 a
 suitcase.
 I
 think


you
 could
 update
 some
 travel
 stuff.


There's
 these
 really
 expensive
 and


amazing,
 they're
 called
 cadence
 capsules


and
 it's
 for
 decanting
 your
 toiletries


into
 and
 they're
 this
 beautiful
 matte


texture
 and
 they
 tessellate
 together
 and


they
 have
 this
 satisfying
 magnetism.
 So,


I
 think
 she
 might
 love
 those.
 Cadence


capsules.
 I
 also
 think,
 you
 know,
 we


have
 some
 really
 good
 Kodapaxi
 packing


cubes
 that
 come
 in
 these
 really
 bright


colors
 and
 are
 pretty
 affordable.
 I


would
 love
 to
 receive
 them.
 I
 have


packing
 cubes.
 Mine
 stink.
 Maybe
 she
 has


packing
 cubes
 and
 hers
 stink
 too.
 So,
 I


think
 those
 could
 be
 awesome.
 thinking


around
 supporting
 that
 travel
 lifestyle


that
 she
 lives.


>> I
 love
 those,
 too.
 For
 anyone
 who
 likes


to
 travel,
 those
 are
 great
 gifts.
 And


for
 people
 who
 aren't
 familiar
 with


packing
 cubes,
 they're
 basically
 like


these
 little
 zippered
 pouches
 that
 you


can
 put
 your
 clothes
 and
 your
 toiletries


and
 all
 the
 various
 things
 that
 you


travel
 with
 and
 keep
 all
 that
 stuff


organized
 in
 a
 suitcase
 or
 a
 duffel
 bag


or
 whatever.


>> And
 it
 compresses
 them
 a
 little
 bit.
 So,


like
 I
 like
 to
 travel
 with
 no
 checked


luggage.
 It
 just
 helps
 you
 to
 make
 that


happen
 in
 a,
 you
 know,
 achievable
 way.


>> Yeah.
 I
 love
 those.
 That's
 so
 great.


Okay.
 Yay.


>> Okay.
 So,
 we
 have
 a
 similar
 question


from
 a
 listener
 RM.
 I'm
 going
 to
 read


this
 one
 out
 loud.
 My
 sister
 retired


after
 making
 Fat
 Bank
 on
 Wall
 Street
 and


wants
 for
 nothing.
 As
 she
 loves


personally
 handcrafted
 gifts,
 I've
 given


her
 glassware
 I've
 hand
 blown,
 a
 quilt
 I


stitched,
 more
 than
 one
 photo
 album
 with


hand
 calligraphy,
 even
 a
 full
 dinner


with
 a
 mane
 requiring
 laminated
 dough.


This
 year,
 I'm
 unlikely
 to
 have
 the
 time


to
 create
 the
 leather
 sling
 bag
 I


envisioned,
 despite
 having
 already


bought
 the
 necessary
 autumal.
 Any
 ideas


for
 a
 gift
 that's
 at
 least
 pseudo


personal
 that
 might
 suffice?
 FYI,
 she


herself
 doesn't
 care
 for
 taking
 craft


lessons
 or
 classes.
 Okay,
 this
 one's


tough.


>> I
 know.
 [laughter]
 I
 like
 it
 though.
 Um,


the
 first
 thing
 that
 came
 to
 mind
 was
 we


have
 an
 Etsy
 seller
 who
 if
 you
 have
 a


little
 piece
 of
 handwriting
 from
 someone


special,
 you
 can
 have
 it
 engraved
 onto
 a


silver
 or
 gold
 cuff.
 Um,
 for
 your
 wrist


for
 your
 wrist,
 like
 it's
 a
 little
 it's


a
 little
 cufflet
 and
 the
 interior
 would


have
 this
 like
 script
 of
 whatever


handwriting
 you
 want
 on
 it.
 Maybe


something
 funny
 from
 their
 mother
 or


from
 their
 father
 that
 could
 be
 really


meaningful
 on
 the
 interior
 of
 a
 bracelet


and
 has
 that
 handmade
 feel
 because
 it
 is


handmade.
 This
 one
 is
 not
 handmade,
 but


it's
 personalized.
 Back
 to
 like
 plastic


that
 isn't
 total
 junk.
 Maybe
 you
 have


heard
 of
 these
 things
 called
 Funko
 Pop.


We
 are
 always
 recommending
 Funko
 Pop.


Funko
 Pop
 are
 these
 little
 trinkets
 you


can
 get
 in
 the
 mall,
 but
 you
 can
 go


online
 and
 they
 have
 this
 really
 great


interface
 where
 you
 can
 personalize
 a


Funko
 Pop.


>> And
 for
 listeners,
 give
 us
 a
 picture
 of


what
 a
 Funko
 Pop
 looks
 like
 because
 I


don't
 think
 everybody
 knows
 what
 they


are.


>> I
 think
 they're
 like
 3
 in
 tall.
 They


have
 little
 squat
 round
 little
 faces.


They're
 like
 a
 little
 doll.


>> A
 little
 doll.
 A
 little
 figurine.
 But


they
 really
 spark
 joy.
 I
 can't
 explain


it.
 That
 is
 not
 what
 I'm
 here
 to
 do
 is


explain
 why
 they
 spark
 joy.
 I
 will
 just


tell
 you
 that
 they
 do.
 They
 are
 so
 cute.


So
 this
 module
 that
 they
 have
 on
 the
 on


the
 Funko
 Pub
 website,
 you
 could


recreate
 a
 little
 figurine
 of
 your


sister
 or
 of
 her
 family.
 And
 they
 are


just
 so
 charming
 and
 so
 delightful.
 They


come
 in
 sort
 of
 a
 great
 box
 that
 says


her
 name
 on
 the
 outside.
 I've
 really


never
 seen
 one
 of
 someone
 that
 I
 know.


We've
 done
 a
 few
 of
 them
 in
 the
 office


for
 like
 staffers
 and
 I
 I
 just
 love
 them


when
 I
 see
 them.
 So,
 the
 other
 thing
 I


like
 about
 the
 online
 module
 is
 that


it's
 not
 so
 many
 steps
 that
 you're
 going


to
 get
 like
 bogged
 down
 and
 be
 like,
 I


actually
 can't
 do
 this.
 You
 could
 make


an
 absolutely
 adorable
 one
 in
 5
 minutes


flat.
 So,
 um


>> I
 love
 that.
 That's
 super
 fun.
 I
 think


that
 would
 also
 make
 a
 great
 maybe
 a


little
 bit
 expensive,
 but
 a
 great
 secret


Santa
 or
 gift.
 Yeah,
 they're
 they're


super
 fun.
 [music]




>> [bell]
>> We
 have
 got
 a
 great
 question
 from
 Mike


in
 Maine
 who
 is
 shopping
 for
 a
 couple


who
 are
 at
 once
 very
 generous
 but
 don't


want
 or
 need
 much
 of
 anything.
 Let's


listen.


>> Hello
 wire
 cutter.
 I
 have
 these


wonderful
 friends,
 a
 terrific
 couple,


and
 we
 are
 very,
 very
 close.
 Buying
 them


gifts,
 however,
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


difficult
 things
 I've
 ever
 had
 to
 do.


They
 are
 incredibly
 well
 off,
 totally


unpretentious,
 and
 when
 meeting
 them,


you'd
 have
 no
 idea
 of
 their
 wealth
 other


than
 they
 are
 well-dressed
 and


well-groomed.
 They
 are
 very,
 very


generous
 to
 me.
 It's
 not
 unusual
 for


them
 to
 spend
 $800
 or
 more
 on
 me
 for


Christmas
 or
 a
 birthday.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


they're
 also
 incredibly
 charitable
 and


very
 generous
 to
 causes
 they
 believe
 in.


I'm
 nowhere
 near
 as
 well
 off
 as
 they


are,
 and
 I
 need
 to
 be
 frugal.
 I
 try
 to


come
 up
 with
 things
 that
 they
 wouldn't


think
 of
 for
 themselves
 or
 things
 that


are
 unique
 for
 them.
 I
 have
 to
 do
 this


three
 times
 a
 year
 for
 his
 birthday,
 her


birthday,
 and
 for
 Christmas.
 I'm
 running


out
 of
 ideas.
 Please
 help.


>> This
 is
 such
 a
 challenge,
 Mike.
 I


actually
 identify
 with
 this
 one
 a
 lot.
 I


have
 been
 in
 the
 situation
 where
 I'm


gifting
 something
 for
 somebody
 who
 makes


a
 lot
 more
 money
 than
 me
 or
 they
 don't


want
 for
 anything.


>> We
 get
 this
 one
 a
 lot.
 So,
 I'm
 happy


that
 Mike
 called.
 And
 I
 also
 am
 from


Maine,
 Mike.
 So
 if
 you
 want
 to
 introduce


me
 to
 your
 friends
 at
 any
 time,
 I'm


[laughter]


really
 down.
 That's
 no
 problem.
 We
 can


just
 get
 together.
 We'll
 start
 with


that.
 So
 a
 couple
 things
 come
 to
 mind


here.
 Thinking
 about
 really
 like
 trusted


heritage
 brands
 is
 a
 really
 good


starting
 point
 when
 you're
 gifting


someone
 who
 has
 more
 money.
 So
 I'm


thinking
 Pendleton,
 I'm
 talking
 LLBAN.


I'm
 talking
 these
 really
 trusted
 brands


that
 you
 can
 go
 to
 and
 you
 could
 get
 a


smaller
 item
 that
 still
 really
 has
 that


sort
 of
 quality
 and
 value
 that
 people


could
 really
 trust.
 I
 think
 another


thing
 to
 think
 about
 is
 the
 material
 of


the
 gift
 that
 you're
 giving.
 So
 like


we're
 talking
 wool,
 we're
 talking


cotton,
 we're
 talking
 copper,
 we're


talking
 enamel.
 Think
 about
 things
 that


will
 like
 last
 a
 really
 long
 time
 that


have
 sort
 of
 like
 an
 inherent
 value
 to


them.
 Those
 things
 don't
 have
 to
 be


expensive.
 For
 Mike,
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 Pendleton
 has
 a
 really
 nice
 $100


cotton
 throw
 that
 we
 were
 testing
 this


year
 that
 we
 really
 like.
 It
 comes
 in
 a


couple
 great
 patterns.
 I
 was
 thinking


about
 that.
 I
 love
 the
 Falcon
 Enamel


Wear
 pitcher
 and
 tumblers.
 So,
 like
 if


Mike
 finds
 himself
 having
 like
 get


togethers
 with
 these
 people,
 they're
 not


expensive
 and
 they're
 so
 lovely
 to


behold
 and
 you
 know,
 he
 could
 bring


those
 over
 and
 it
 could
 be
 for
 like


lemonade
 in
 the
 summer
 or
 it
 could
 hold


flowers.
 The
 other
 thing,
 Mike
 being


from
 Maine,
 obviously
 LLBA,
 like
 I
 can't


think
 of
 anyone
 who
 couldn't
 use
 another


boat
 tote
 with
 a
 you
 know,


>> you're
 you're
 required
 to
 have
 at least


three
 or
 four
 as
 mayors,
 right?


>> That's
 correct.
 It's
 like
 when
 you
 come


into
 the
 state,
 they
 give
 you
 um
 and


then
 this
 really
 weird
 one
 came
 to
 mind,


Mike,
 that
 we've
 seen
 this
 year
 that
 we


have
 in
 a
 couple
 gift
 guides,
 which
 is


the
 main
 shakers
 make
 a
 handmade
 parlor


broom.
 So,
 it's
 just
 a
 beautiful


handmade
 broom.
 You
 can
 buy
 it
 online.
 I


think
 it's
 around
 $100.
 So,
 and
 I
 just


think
 it
 would
 make
 the
 most
 lovely


gift.
 Someone
 gave
 it
 to
 me
 a
 couple


years
 back.
 It
 is
 so
 wellm
 made.
 It
 just


makes
 sort
 of
 like
 an
 arduous
 task
 into


something
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 kind
 of


elevated.
 So
 main
 shaker
 parlor
 room.


And
 then
 another
 thought
 Mike
 for
 you
 is


this
 Bram
 Mountain
 brand
 which
 comes


from
 Maine.
 They
 make
 cotton
 blankets
 as


well.
 Their
 base
 level
 throw
 is
 really


really
 lovely.
 I
 can't
 think
 of
 if
 the


people
 that
 you
 cherish
 so
 much
 don't


already
 have
 one.
 I
 think
 they'd
 love


one.


>> I
 like
 that
 you
 focused
 on
 some
 Maine


gifts.
 So
 that
 might
 also
 be
 an
 idea


because
 pretty
 much
 any
 state
 is
 going


to
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 heritage
 brand


coming
 out
 of
 it.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 nice


and
 thoughtful,
 too.


[music]


What
 do
 you
 do
 in
 the
 scenario
 when


somebody
 just
 absolutely
 says,
 "I
 don't


need
 anything.
 Don't
 gift
 me
 anything.


I'm
 good."
 Do
 you
 listen
 to
 them?
 What


if
 you
 feel
 compelled
 to
 give
 a
 gift


still?
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 struggle


with
 that
 where
 someone's
 saying
 like,


"I
 don't
 really
 need
 anything."
 Maybe


it's
 like
 an
 in-law
 or
 their
 parent
 or


something,


>> but
 then
 they
 still
 feel
 this,
 I
 don't


know,
 societal
 expectation
 to
 give
 a


gift.


>> I
 do
 go
 back
 into
 really
 good
 listening,


hearing
 what
 they're
 saying.
 And
 I
 also


go
 into
 another
 level
 of
 that,
 which
 is


like
 power
 of
 observation.
 So,
 if
 you're


in
 their
 home,
 I'm
 looking
 around.
 I'm


seeing
 what
 they
 have.
 I'm
 seeing
 what


maybe
 we
 could
 do
 like
 a
 little
 upgrade


on
 something
 that
 they
 have,
 but
 we


could
 do
 a
 little
 better.
 If
 you're


having
 dinner
 at
 their
 house
 and
 there's


a
 serving
 tray
 and
 it
 has
 a
 chip
 in
 it,


are
 we
 getting
 a
 new
 serving
 tray?
 Have


they
 sort
 of
 noticed
 something
 that
 you


have
 and
 been
 like,
 "Oh
 gosh,
 I
 love


your
 bag."
 Try
 to
 get
 into
 upgrading


things
 that
 they
 might
 already
 have.
 And


then
 I
 also
 really
 for
 people
 that
 say


they
 don't
 want
 a
 gift,
 I
 think
 a


upgraded
 staple
 is
 another
 great
 idea.


Things
 that
 absolutely
 everybody
 uses,


but
 you
 could
 get
 them
 the
 very
 best


version
 of
 that
 thing.


>> Give
 me
 some
 examples.
 I
 just
 feel
 like


I
 see
 like
 my
 sister,
 bless
 her
 little


heart,
 they
 have
 so
 many
 junky
 coffee


tumblers
 in
 their
 house.
 It's
 a
 whole


cabinet
 of
 horrible,
 horrible
 coffee


tumblers
 that
 I
 think
 have
 been
 gifted


through
 work
 and
 through
 I
 don't
 know.


Wouldn't
 my
 sister
 love
 a
 beautiful,


perfect,
 non-leaking
 coffee
 tumbler
 that


could
 just
 be
 perfect,
 fit
 in
 any
 cup


hold,
 not
 falling
 over
 every
 two


seconds?
 So,
 like
 things
 like
 that
 where


you
 could
 just
 get
 them
 the
 wire
 cutter


pick
 of
 a
 sort
 of
 everyday
 item
 and
 just


give
 them
 like
 the
 absolute
 best
 one.


[music]


Hannah,
 we
 have
 one
 final
 question.
 So,


this
 one
 is
 from
 Don,
 who
 is
 asking


about
 gifting
 for
 her
 colleagues.
 Let's


listen.
 Hi,
 I'm
 Don
 from
 Seattle,


Washington.
 When
 I
 was
 doing
 sales,
 my


manager
 always
 sent
 a
 gift
 around
 the


holidays,
 and
 it
 was
 something
 like
 a


cake
 from
 Gold
 Belly
 or
 a
 Harry
 and


David
 gift
 box.
 Uh,
 something
 that
 just


felt
 like
 it
 was
 out
 of
 a
 corporate


giving
 catalog.
 And
 I
 always
 assumed


that
 it
 was
 paid
 for
 by
 my
 company.
 But


now
 that
 I
 am
 a
 manager,
 I've
 learned


there
 is
 no
 budget
 for
 gift
 giving
 and


anything
 I
 want
 to
 send
 comes
 out
 of
 my


own
 pocket.
 But
 we've
 also
 had
 some


changes
 at
 work
 and
 where
 my
 previous


managers
 have
 had
 8
 to
 10
 people
 that


they
 manage
 and
 I
 manage
 30.
 And
 it's


just
 not
 reasonable
 to
 send
 them
 all
 an


$80
 gift
 basket.
 I
 feel
 stuck
 because
 I


know
 everyone's
 expecting
 something
 and


anything
 that
 I
 do
 that's
 less
 than
 what


they've
 had
 before,
 they're
 going
 to


feel
 like
 something
 is
 taken
 away.
 So,


any
 help
 would
 be
 greatly
 appreciated.


Thank
 you.


>> Okay,
 Don,
 we
 first
 need
 to
 talk
 about


why
 do
 you
 have
 30
 reports?
 That's
 way


too
 many
 reports,
 first
 of
 all,
 but
 we


will
 skip
 over
 that
 and
 get
 to
 the
 real


problem.
 So,
 Hannah,
 what
 do
 we
 do
 for


Don?


>> I'm
 so
 glad
 that
 Don
 called.
 As
 Don


brought
 up,
 you
 don't
 want
 it
 to
 feel


generic
 or
 like
 from
 a
 corporate


catalog.
 So,
 like
 I
 hate
 to
 give
 this


advice,
 but
 like
 we're
 talking
 name


brands,
 Don.
 We're
 talking
 Bagu,
 we're


talking
 Stanley,
 Hydro
 Flask.
 A


recognizable
 brand
 could
 be
 a
 really


nice
 thing
 for
 people.
 I
 do
 think
 that


Bagu
 makes
 like
 pouches
 and
 everyone
 can


use
 things
 like
 that.
 I've
 already


mentioned
 coffee
 tumblers
 and
 water


bottles,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 people


appreciate
 high
 quality
 versions
 of


that.
 I
 also
 think
 about
 tech
 in
 this


moment.
 There's
 this
 really
 great
 travel


charger
 called
 the
 you
 know
 this
 one.
 I


just
 love
 it.
 It's
 a
 great
 gift
 and
 if


Don
 hasn't
 heard
 of
 it,
 she
 should
 do


it.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 sharp
 price.
 The


travel
 card
 one
 word
 charger
 I
 believe


plus
 is
 the
 version
 that
 they're
 using


now.
 It
 comes
 in
 a
 range
 of
 colors.
 You


can
 charge
 a
 range
 of
 devices.
 It's
 as


thin
 as
 a
 credit
 card.
 That
 would
 be
 an


awesome
 gift.
 So
 thinking
 of
 small


little
 things
 like
 that
 could
 upgrade


everyday
 lives.
 I
 also
 think
 that
 travel


is
 a
 really
 nice
 thing
 to
 think
 about


when
 you're
 thinking
 about
 the
 people


that
 work
 for
 you
 because
 I
 think
 it


acknowledges
 a
 life
 outside
 of
 your


day-to-day
 with
 work.
 Years
 ago,
 I
 was


gifted
 by
 the
 sort
 of
 editor-in
 chief
 of


the
 magazine.
 I
 was
 working
 a
 passport


cover,
 a
 leather
 passport
 cover,
 and
 we


recommend
 it
 to
 this
 day
 at
 Wire
 Cutter


because
 I
 still
 carry
 it.
 The
 brand
 is


Tusk.
 comes
 in
 again
 a
 range
 of
 colors,


nice
 luggage
 tags,
 universal
 travel


adapters,
 little
 travel
 dudads
 that
 are


lovely,
 I
 think
 are
 also
 a
 really
 good


vein
 of
 awesome
 gifts.
 I
 love
 that.
 What


about
 consumables
 for
 Don?
 You
 know,
 she


mentioned
 a
 range
 of
 sort
 of
 gift


baskets
 she's
 received
 in
 the
 past
 and
 I


think
 that's
 a
 common
 gift
 in
 this
 kind


of
 scenario.
 Are
 there
 any
 of
 our


consumable
 gifts
 that
 you
 would


recommend
 for
 her?
 I'm
 thinking
 like


maybe
 things
 that
 address
 this
 issue


that
 she
 has
 of
 like
 wanting
 to
 present


something
 that
 maybe
 seems
 nicer
 and


more
 expensive
 than
 she's
 actually


spending.
 Rather
 than
 going
 to
 like
 full


on
 gift
 baskets,
 gifting
 random
 little


tins
 of
 amazing
 things.
 So
 last
 year
 we


recommended
 this
 can
 of
 chips
 that


everyone
 was
 going
 crazy
 for.
 This
 year


there's
 this
 beautiful
 French
 can
 of


mustard.
 It
 comes
 in
 a
 little
 pale
 that


is
 Have
 you
 seen
 it?
 It
 is.
 It's
 so
 I


think
 the
 brand
 is
 Fellow.
 It
 is
 so


delicious
 and
 layered
 and
 complex.
 It's


made
 with
 like
 the
 press
 from
 Champagne


Grapes.
 It's
 really
 lovely
 and
 under
 20


bucks
 that
 also
 comes
 in
 a
 tube.
 We
 have


these
 really
 wonderful
 anchovy
 stuffed


olives
 that
 people
 go
 crazy
 for.
 There's


this
 brand
 of
 unbelievable
 merated


cherries
 called
 Luxardo
 Cherries.
 So,
 um


you
 love
 Luxardo
 Cherries
 cocktails.
 So,


rather
 than
 doing
 full-on
 gift
 basket,


you
 could
 do
 these
 sort
 of
 like
 oneoff


little
 very
 elevated,
 very
 lovely
 little


jars
 or
 cans
 of
 delightful
 things.
 I


think
 that's
 an
 really
 nice
 idea
 as


well.


[music]


[bell]


>> Hannah,
 your
 team
 spends
 all
 year
 just


canvasing
 the
 world
 for
 great
 gifts.
 I'm


curious
 if
 there
 are
 any
 new
 gifts
 that


you're
 recommending
 this
 year
 that


you're
 really,
 really
 excited
 about.


>> Absolutely.
 So
 many.
 I
 saw
 this
 block


design
 is
 the
 brand
 reversible
 glass


vase.
 So
 if
 if
 you
 sit
 it
 one
 way,
 you


can
 put
 like
 a
 single
 bloom
 in
 the
 like


little
 vessel
 down
 the
 center
 and
 if
 you


set
 it
 the
 other
 way,
 you
 have
 like
 a


wider
 rim
 with
 which
 to
 put
 a
 bigger


bouquet.
 And
 I
 just
 think
 the
 like


novelty
 of
 that
 and
 the
 practicality
 of


that
 is
 so
 great.
 And
 it's
 pretty
 enough


that
 it
 could
 just
 sit
 on
 its
 own
 as


well.
 I
 think
 that's
 also
 nice
 with
 a


vase
 is
 if
 it
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 flowers


in
 it,
 you
 can
 still
 enjoy
 looking
 at


it.
 For
 a
 kids
 gift,
 we
 saw
 these


Japanese
 cray
 paws.


>> What's
 a
 Craypaw?


>> Thanks
 for
 asking.
 A
 Craypaw,
 I
 believe,


is
 a
 smudgy
 sort
 of
 material
 that's
 sort


of
 like
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 crayon
 and


paint
 adjacent.
 What
 did
 they
 water


pastels
 they
 called
 them
 in
 the
 past


thing.
 They
 are
 this
 Japanese
 brand.
 And


it's
 this
 beautiful
 range
 of
 them.
 And
 I


think
 my
 kids
 would
 really
 enjoy
 them.


And
 I
 also
 think
 they're
 great
 for


adults.
 They
 come
 in
 a
 really
 nice


little
 box.
 And
 I
 think
 anyone
 that
 sort


of
 has
 this
 like
 desire
 to
 paint
 or
 sort


of
 express
 themselves
 artistically,
 I


think
 it's
 a
 really
 nice
 offering.


They're
 really
 easy
 to
 work
 with
 and


kind
 of
 forgiving
 and
 almost
 like


anything
 you
 do
 with
 them
 kind
 of
 looks


really
 like
 great
 and
 intentional.
 So,


I'm
 really
 into
 those
 Japanese
 crayons.


Oh,
 I
 almost
 forgot.
 A
 thing
 I'm
 also


really
 crazy
 about
 is
 this
 new
 thing


called
 Tiny
 Vinyl.
 Tiny
 Vinyl
 are
 tiny


little
 records
 and
 they're
 maybe
 3
 in


wide
 and
 they
 play
 a
 song
 on
 each
 side.


They
 just
 launched
 this
 year.
 I
 think


they're
 about
 15
 bucks.
 And
 the
 cat
 put


them
 on
 a
 regular
 regular
 recorder.
 Oh


my.


>> But
 the
 cool
 thing
 I
 like
 about
 is
 the


edit
 that
 this
 company
 has
 done
 is
 like


all
 the
 best
 classics.
 So
 like
 Notorious


B.I.
 Charlie
 Brown
 Christmas
 and
 Frank


Sinatra
 and
 then
 also
 like
 Doi
 and
 Doaat


Chapel
 Ran
 like
 just
 a
 really
 cool


selection
 of
 vinyl.
 I
 think
 that's
 a


really
 fun
 little
 Nobody's
 seen
 that


before.


>> That's
 super
 fun.
 Singles.
 That's
 great.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Back
 to
 singles.


>> Hannah,
 these
 are
 such
 great
 great


ideas.
 I
 love
 all
 of
 them.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 coming.
 We're
 going
 to
