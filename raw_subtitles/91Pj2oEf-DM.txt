>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLotss
 podcast.
 [music]
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> Joe,
 you're
 a
 gym
 person,
 aren't
 you?


Notice
 I
 did
 not
 say
 gym
 bro.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 That's
 right.
 Thank


you.
 Aspirationally,
 I
 do
 go
 to
 the
 gym


regularly.
 I
 don't
 go
 to
 the
 gym


regularly
 enough
 to
 see
 a
 difference.
 I


think
 bec
 like
 I'm
 at
 the
 stage
 of
 life


where
 like
 every
 day
 I'm
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 closer
 to
 death
 and
 so
 I'm


like
 holding
 serve.
 I'm
 like
 sort
 of


holding
 at
 the
 same
 so
 like
 I
 know


progress
 but
 maybe
 I'm
 not
 regressing.


But
 yes,


>> I
 still
 think
 if
 you
 go
 to
 the
 gym


regularly,
 you're
 a
 gym
 person.


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 Yeah.
 All
 right.


>> That's
 that's
 impressive.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 gonna
 have
 less
 shame
 about


it.


>> Okay.
 Here's
 my
 question.
 Yeah.


>> Have
 you
 noticed
 the
 drinking
 habits
 of


some
 of
 your
 fellow
 gym
 people?
 Have
 you


noticed
 anyone
 walking
 around
 with


bottles
 of
 milk?


>> I
 have.
 I
 mean,
 I
 still
 see
 more
 people


with
 like
 the
 energy
 drinks
 rather
 than


milk.
 But
 yeah,
 I've
 definitely
 seen,


you
 know,
 I
 think
 like
 back
 in
 the
 day,


you
 know,
 you
 had
 these
 guys.
 I
 think


some
 of
 them
 still
 do
 with
 actual
 like


people
 would
 try
 to
 drink
 a
 gallon
 of


milk
 in
 a
 day.
 There's
 that
 famous
 um
 um


guy,
 he
 has
 a
 book
 called
 Starting


Strength.
 He's
 like
 a
 cult
 guru
 within


the
 barbell
 world
 whose
 name
 I'm


blanking
 on.
 I
 think
 he's
 a
 big
 like


drink
 a
 bunch
 of
 milk


>> guy.


>> If
 you're
 serious
 about
 it,
 you
 got
 to


mix
 raw
 eggs
 in
 with
 milk.
 That's
 what
 I


say.


>> You
 do?
 Have
 you
 done
 that?


>> No,
 I
 haven't.
 Although
 I
 did
 when
 I
 I


triple
 fractured
 my
 foot
 when
 I
 was
 in


Hong
 Kong
 and
 I
 did
 have
 a
 doctor
 who


advised
 me
 to
 drink
 a
 lot
 of
 milk
 to


build
 up
 the
 calcium
 and
 heal
 the
 foot.


Anyway,
 we're
 getting
 slightly
 off


topic.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 One
 of
 the
 milk
 brands
 that
 you


see
 a
 lot
 in
 gyms
 is
 something
 called


Fair
 Life.


>> Yeah,
 I've
 seen
 it
 and
 I
 actually


literally
 like
 had
 never
 thought
 about


what
 it
 is
 or
 but
 yes,
 I
 had
 seen
 this


brand.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 much
 about


it,
 but
 I
 first
 got
 kind
 of
 interested


in
 the
 company
 reading
 Austin
 Freric's


book
 Barrens.
 There's
 a
 whole
 chapter
 in


there
 about
 dairy
 barons,


>> and
 it's
 about
 fair
 oaks,
 which
 turned


into
 Fair
 Life.


>> All
 I
 know
 about
 Fair
 Life
 is
 that
 Coke


bought
 them.
 They
 had
 a
 big
 distribution


deal
 with
 Coke
 and
 we
 know
 how
 important


distribution
 is
 in
 the
 beverage
 industry


from
 our
 previous
 conversations
 on


Celsius
 and
 things
 like
 that.


>> And
 it's
 turned
 into
 this
 phenomenon


where
 Fair
 Life
 is
 this
 milk
 that's
 I


guess
 supposed
 to
 be
 healthier.
 It
 has


more
 protein.


>> Uh
 it
 has
 less
 lactose
 or
 no
 lactose,
 I


can't
 remember.
 Which
 means
 you
 can
 keep


it
 in
 your
 fridge
 for
 like
 a
 100
 days,


>> which
 is
 actually
 I
 find
 that
 useful.


So,
 we
 should
 talk
 about
 it
 because
 it's


also
 kind
 of
 kicked
 off
 this
 whole


protein
 craze.


>> Protein.
 Oh
 my
 god.
 Protein
 everywhere.


So,
 protein
 like
 uh
 yes,
 Starbucks,
 they


have
 these.
 Now,
 you
 can
 get
 this


protein
 drinks.
 I
 haven't
 tried
 them


yet.
 I
 you
 know,


>> when
 did
 it
 become
 a
 crime
 to
 just
 eat


normally?
 I
 got
 I
 eat
 some
 meat
 and
 I


eat
 some
 veggies
 and
 occasionally
 eat


some
 carbs
 and
 stuff
 like
 that
 and


whatever.
 But
 yeah,
 you
 over
 time
 it's


like
 different
 macronutrients
 trend,


right?
 So
 there
 was
 a
 while
 it's
 like


good
 fats,
 right?
 People
 were
 really


into
 fats
 for
 a
 while
 and
 then
 it's


like,
 oh,
 you
 need
 fermented
 stuff,
 so


they
 have
 to,
 you
 know,
 let's
 eat
 more


of
 that.
 It's
 good
 for
 your
 gut
 health.


But
 we're
 in
 like
 a
 we're
 certainly
 in
 a


protein
 bull
 market
 right
 now.
 People


really
 want
 more
 protein
 because


reasons.


>> Yeah.
 And
 what's
 interesting
 again
 about


Fair
 Life
 is
 it's
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


That's
 feeding
 into
 CO's
 bottom
 line.


Share
 price
 has
 gone
 up
 quite
 a
 bit.
 And


it's
 also
 at
 odds
 with
 basically


everything
 else
 that's
 happening
 in
 the


dairy
 industry
 where
 you
 know
 prices


tend
 to
 be
 pretty
 low
 and
 have
 been
 kind


of
 stuck
 in
 a
 downward
 spiral
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Profit
 margins
 are
 very
 very
 thin.


So
 this
 is
 an
 outlier.


>> People
 are
 consuming
 less
 traditional


dairy.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 you
 know
 at least
 I


don't
 know
 how
 big
 is
 it
 it
 is
 but
 some


of
 the
 quote
 alternative
 milks,
 the


almond
 milks
 of
 the
 world,
 the
 cashew


milks,
 soy
 milks
 probably
 taking
 some


Yeah.
 plain
 old
 regular
 dairy.
 No
 one


ever
 talks
 about,
 by
 the
 way,
 number
 two


milk.
 I
 feel
 like
 everyone
 is
 either


skim
 or
 fat
 these
 days
 because
 more
 of


the
 sort
 of
 like
 polarization
 of
 society


that
 no
 one
 likes
 a
 nice
 middle
 ground


milk
 anymore.
 So
 now
 apparently
 they


want
 super
 high
 protein
 milk,
 too.


>> All right,
 so
 we
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest


to
 discuss
 Fair
 Life
 and
 the
 dairy


industry
 in
 general.
 We're
 going to
 be


speaking
 with
 Corey
 Guyger.
 He
 is
 the


lead
 dairy
 economist
 with
 Coobank,
 which


is
 a
 very
 big
 lender
 to
 the
 industry.
 So


really
 the
 perfect
 person
 to
 speak
 to.


Corey,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on


Odd
 Thoughts.


>> Well,
 I'm
 glad
 to
 be
 here,
 Tracy
 and


Joe.


>> So
 I'm
 going
 to
 start
 with
 a
 basic


question.
 What
 differentiates
 Fair
 Life


from
 traditional
 [clears throat]
 milk?


>> I
 think
 there's
 two
 big
 parts
 to
 this


protein
 and
 portability.
 The
 portability


is
 it's
 ultraasteurized
 and
 uses
 aseptic


packaging.
 So
 that
 means
 it
 you
 can


actually
 ship
 it
 without
 refrigeration.


And
 when
 you
 think
 about
 the
 dairy


industry,
 the
 dairy
 industry
 is
 the


largest
 refrigerated
 food
 chain
 in
 the


world
 really.
 You
 think
 as
 soon
 as
 we


milk
 a
 cow
 and
 we
 cool
 the
 milk,
 it's


cooled
 in
 the
 truck
 to
 the
 processing


plant
 and
 then
 traditional
 dairy


products
 are
 refrigerated
 all
 the
 way
 to


the
 grocery
 store
 or
 convenience
 store.


But
 the
 Fairlife
 story
 and
 products
 like


it
 now
 are
 uh
 when
 you
 go
 to
 that


aseptic
 packaging
 and
 ultra
 filtration


until
 you
 open
 that
 bottle,
 it's
 got
 a


lot
 longer
 shelf
 life.
 Of
 course,
 once


it's
 opened,
 you're
 at
 a
 the
 14-day


clock
 starts
 ticking.
 this
 technology


that
 allows
 you
 to
 store
 milk
 for
 a
 long


time
 without
 refrigeration.
 Is
 this


something
 that's
 been
 understood
 for
 a


long
 time
 and
 now
 there's
 suddenly
 a


demand
 for
 this
 milk
 or
 is
 the


technology
 relatively
 recent
 and
 then


the
 industry
 is
 like
 oh
 we
 can
 because


of
 this
 technology
 we
 can
 market
 and
 get


people
 excited
 about
 a
 new
 product
 that


can
 take
 advantage
 of
 these


capabilities.


>> Well,
 Fairlife
 first
 came
 on
 the
 scene


in
 2014.
 So,
 it's
 been
 with
 us
 about
 a


decade.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 the


team
 at
 Fairlife
 had
 to
 really
 perfect


was
 this
 high
 temperature,
 shorttime


pasteurization.
 So,
 you're
 heating
 the


milk
 up
 quick
 and
 then
 cooling
 it
 quick.


One
 of
 the
 things
 I
 like
 sharing
 is
 that


milk
 is
 nature's
 most
 perfect
 beverage.


You
 talked
 about
 it
 being
 a
 health


beverage.
 If
 it's
 nature's
 most
 perfect


beverage,
 that
 also
 means
 it's
 a
 great


place
 to
 grow
 bacteria.
 So


pasteurization,
 you
 know,
 over
 100
 years


ago,
 the
 pasteurized
 milk
 ordinance
 came


about
 and
 that
 set
 a
 national
 standard


so
 that
 a
 Wisconsin
 farmer
 could
 sell


milk
 in
 the
 Chicago
 market
 or
 a
 upstate


New
 York
 farmer
 could
 sell
 milk
 into
 the


in
 New
 York
 City
 under
 the
 same
 rules


and
 standards.
 But
 going
 to
 this
 ultra


the
 HTST,
 the
 high
 temperature
 shorttime


pasteurization,
 originally
 you
 kind
 of


got
 a
 burnt
 milk
 taste.
 So,
 if
 you're
 a


consumer
 and
 you're
 tasting
 that,
 you're


like,
 "Eh,
 it
 didn't
 hit
 the
 mark."
 But


now,
 they
 pro
 perfected
 that
 process
 and


you
 really
 get
 the
 flavor
 that
 you've


come
 to
 expect
 from
 a
 dairy
 milk.


>> You
 mentioned
 having
 to
 um
 sell
 into


markets,
 and
 I'm
 not
 quite
 sure
 why,
 but


I
 was
 reading
 a
 book
 about
 small-scale


farming
 from
 the
 1950s
 last
 night,
 and


it
 was
 talking
 about
 if
 you're
 a


smallcale
 farmer
 and
 you
 want
 to
 get


into
 dairy,
 you
 have
 some
 options.
 One


option
 is
 you
 sell
 into
 a
 local
 market


that's
 very
 close
 to
 you
 because
 you


know
 you
 can't
 refrigerate
 the
 milk
 for


that
 long
 or
 you
 sell
 to
 like
 a
 cheese


factory
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and
 you


can
 go
 a
 little
 bit
 further
 sell
 maybe


more
 in
 bulk
 that
 sort
 of
 thing.
 How
 big


a
 deal
 was
 fairife's
 distribution
 deal


with
 Coke
 in
 its
 success?
 this
 idea
 that


now
 you
 have
 a
 beverage
 that
 can
 be


shipped
 over
 very
 very
 long
 distances,


long
 timelines
 and
 you
 have
 Coke


distributing
 it.


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 huge
 when
 you
 really
 look


at
 it.
 I
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 founders
 of


the
 concept
 of
 what
 became
 fair
 life


originally
 they
 were
 experimenting
 Mike


and
 Sumaclausi
 with
 a
 product
 that
 they


eventually
 called
 athletes
 milk
 honey


and
 so
 they
 were
 looking
 at
 finding
 a


health
 beverage
 for
 consumers
 in
 that
 in


that
 market.
 So
 there's
 one
 thing
 to
 be


innovative,


then
 it's
 distribution.
 And
 one
 of
 the


for
 me,
 I'm
 a
 grew
 up
 on
 a
 sixth


generation
 Wisconsin
 dairy
 farmer.
 One


of
 the
 obstacles
 always
 for
 milk
 has


been
 portability.
 You
 know,
 it's
 you


have
 to
 have
 this
 elaborate


transportation
 system
 to
 move
 it.
 And


I'm
 talking
 beverage
 milk
 here.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that
 really
 overcame
 the


situation
 with
 what
 Fairlife
 has
 done


with
 aseptic
 packaging
 and
 the
 HSUT


process
 to
 high
 pasteurization.
 It
 was


gamechanging.


I
 think
 this
 is
 old
 news,
 but
 it
 used
 to


be
 the
 case
 that
 milk
 prices,
 what's
 the


deal?
 They
 were
 like
 set
 based
 on
 your


distance
 from
 Oaklair,
 Wisconsin
 or


something
 like
 that
 because
 there
 was


this
 premise
 like
 oh
 we
 want
 milk
 very


far
 away
 and
 you
 you
 sell
 it
 to
 your


local
 market
 and
 it's
 distri
 explain


that
 that
 went
 away
 or
 something
 but
 why


was
 Oaklair
 Wisconsin
 this
 sort
 of


central
 hub
 for
 a
 while
 of
 the
 index
 for


pricing
 milk
 explain
 that


>> yes
 there's
 a
 number
 of
 reasons
 for
 it


actually
 we'll
 start
 with
 a
 little
 dairy


history
 up
 until
 about
 1910
 New
 York


[clears throat]
 New
 York
 was
 the
 largest


milk
 producing
 state
 in
 the
 United


States.
 Then
 that
 became
 Wisconsin
 and


obviously
 now
 America's
 dairy
 land
 is
 on


the
 license
 plates.
 Wisconsin
 actually


in
 the
 1800
 late
 1800s
 the
 gentleman
 who


became
 governor
 of
 the
 state
 William


Dempster
 Horde
 secured
 the
 first


refrigerated
 rail
 car
 to
 ship
 Wisconsin


cheese
 to
 New
 York
 City
 in
 the
 1870s.


And
 today,
 Wisconsin
 exports
 about
 90%


of
 their
 milk
 production
 via
 cheese.
 And


that
 export
 could
 be
 the
 other
 49
 states


and
 certainly
 now
 around
 the
 world.
 But


because
 of
 all
 the
 cheese
 made
 in


Wisconsin
 and
 Minnesota,


Oaklair
 was
 that
 kind
 of
 center
 point


between
 Wisconsin
 and
 Minnesota
 to


establish
 a
 a
 base
 price
 for
 milk.
 That


went
 away
 here
 in
 about
 2000
 and
 we
 have


a
 different
 system.
 But
 milk
 is
 still


highly
 regulated
 under
 federal
 milk


marketing
 orders,
 which
 is
 really
 what


establishes
 milk
 prices.


>> Well,
 can
 you
 just
 real
 quickly
 explain


what
 are
 these
 or
 like
 what
 does
 that


mean?
 Like
 it's
 regulate
 because
 I
 the


prices
 do
 fluctuate.
 So
 what
 does
 that


mean
 that
 it's
 still
 highly
 regulated?


>> Yeah,
 highly
 regulated
 means
 that


federal
 milk
 marketing
 orders
 there's


four
 classes
 of
 milk.
 Class
 one
 would
 be


beverage
 milk.
 That
 would
 be
 the


traditional
 milk
 that
 you
 drink.
 And


when
 you
 come
 back
 to
 the
 fair
 life


story
 and
 you
 uh
 discussed
 that
 milk


fluid
 milk
 sales
 have
 been
 flat
 but


products
 like
 fair
 life
 and
 core
 power


and
 those
 are
 actually
 a
 mixture
 of


fluid
 milk
 and
 class
 two
 products
 which


traditionally
 have
 been
 scoopable


products
 like
 yogurt
 ice
 cream
 would
 be


in
 there.
 Sour
 cream
 would
 be
 in
 there


and
 then
 class
 three
 I
 liked
 sharing


little
 Miss
 Tuffet
 sat
 on
 her
 muffet


eating
 her
 curds
 and
 waist.
 So
 class
 3


is
 cheese,
 curds
 and
 whey.
 And
 then


class
 4
 products
 are
 butter
 and
 powder.


And
 powder
 would
 be
 non-fat
 dry
 milk.


But
 each
 of
 these
 classes
 has
 different


pricing
 mechanisms.


And
 today
 beverage
 milk
 is
 priced
 on
 the


higher
 of
 class
 3
 or
 class
 4.
 It
 gets


complicated
 and
 that's
 why
 I
 call
 dairy


very
 regulated.
 But
 these
 orders
 came


about
 in
 1937.
 It
 was
 an
 act
 of
 Congress


and
 it
 was
 to
 ensure
 the
 orderly


marketing
 of
 milk
 and
 ensure
 fluid
 milk


in
 markets
 that
 didn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


dairy
 cows.


>> So
 [clears throat]


one
 thing
 I
 learned
 from
 reading
 my
 old


farming
 book
 is
 that
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


levers
 that
 you
 can
 pull
 if
 you're
 again


this
 is
 for
 smallcale
 farming
 but
 there


are
 levers
 you
 can
 pull
 to
 boost
 profit.


So
 maybe
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 make
 that


much
 from
 milk
 itself,
 but
 you
 know,
 you


can
 sell
 the
 calves
 for
 ve
 or
 once
 the


uh
 dairy
 production
 starts
 going
 down


with
 your
 cows,
 you
 can
 sell
 those
 or


you
 can
 sell
 manure
 for
 fertilizer
 and


things
 like
 that.
 All
 these
 different


levers.
 Can
 you
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 more


about
 the
 actual
 business
 model
 of
 a


dairy
 farm
 and
 where
 money
 comes
 from


nowadays?
 Because
 I
 imagine
 it's
 changed


quite
 a
 bit.


This
 is
 a
 dynamic
 space
 and
 from
 an
 over


we'll
 talk
 about
 the
 dairy
 farm
 in
 a


second
 but
 dairy
 right
 now
 has
 11


billion
 dollar
 of
 new
 plant
 investment


in
 the
 United
 States
 and
 it's
 in
 a


number
 of
 categories.
 So
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 energy
 taking
 place
 and
 a
 lot
 of


investment.
 This
 is
 historic
 investment.


When
 you
 get
 to
 the
 dairy
 farm
 obviously


if
 you're
 a
 milking
 cows
 your
 number
 one


revenue
 source
 is
 milk.
 I
 would
 say
 up


until
 5
 years
 ago,
 90%
 of
 your
 income


came
 from
 milk
 unless
 you
 were
 selling
 a


lot
 of
 crops.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 dynamic


things
 that
 have
 changed
 and
 it's
 in
 the


news
 a
 lot
 right
 now
 is
 beef
 prices.


>> And
 every
 cow
 has
 a
 second
 career
 as
 a


beef
 animal.
 About
 five
 years
 ago,
 well,


I
 considered
 the
 dairy
 cow
 the
 most


researched
 animal
 on
 planet
 Earth.
 We


know
 more
 about
 her.
 We
 have
 over
 123


million
 records
 on
 her
 over
 the
 last


hundred
 years.
 In
 2008,
 the
 science
 of


genomics
 came
 into
 the
 industry.
 I
 was


actually
 the
 first
 one
 to
 write
 a
 public


article
 about
 it.
 But
 what
 you
 do
 is
 you


take
 a
 a
 DNA
 sample
 from
 the
 cow.
 You


run
 her
 profile
 and
 you
 can
 compare
 it


to
 all
 this
 phenotypic
 data
 that
 123


million
 records.
 And
 with
 about
 70%


accuracy,


we
 can
 predict
 what
 that
 baby
 calf
 will


do
 as
 a
 cow.
 And
 that
 has
 changed
 a
 lot


of
 things
 in
 dairy.
 We
 are
 uh
 improving


butter
 fat
 and
 protein
 levels
 at
 paces


we've
 never
 seen
 before.
 And
 these
 days,


one
 out
 of
 four
 heer
 calavs,
 baby
 calves


that
 will
 eventually
 become
 cows
 have
 a


genomic
 test
 run
 on
 them.
 And
 that
 has


really
 changed
 things.
 Then
 as
 that
 took


place,
 gender
 sorted
 semen
 came
 into
 the


industry
 so
 we
 can
 uh
 they
 use
 lasers.


They
 can
 sort
 out
 the
 Y
 chromosomes


which
 make
 a
 bull
 calf
 and
 with
 about
 90


to
 95%
 accuracy
 produce
 a
 product
 that


makes
 dairy
 heer
 calves.
 So
 dairy


farmers
 were
 planning
 their


replacements.
 They're
 using
 science
 to


predict
 the
 ones.
 And
 that
 opened
 a


whole
 new
 door


to
 use
 what
 we
 call
 beef
 breeds.
 Think


Angus,
 Limousine,
 Charlay
 that
 we
 would


breed
 those.
 We'd
 use
 artificial


insemination,
 the
 original
 AI
 in


agriculture,
 not
 [laughter]
 artificial


intelligence,
 to
 uh
 inseminate
 the
 cows.


And
 dairy
 farmers
 are
 making
 more
 money


on
 that
 these
 days.
 So
 about
 five
 years


ago,
 back
 to
 Tracy's
 original
 question,


a
 dairy
 farmer
 was
 making
 about
 $1
 per


hundred
 weight,
 per
 100
 pounds
 of
 milk


equivalent
 from
 beef
 sales.
 and
 say
 a


dairy
 farmer
 is
 making
 18
 to
 20.
 So
 it


wasn't
 $18
 to
 $20
 per
 hundred
 weight
 for


milk.
 It
 wasn't
 a
 big
 deal.
 But
 today


that
 number
 has
 gone
 to
 4450.
 So
 we're


get
 generating
 a
 baby
 black
 heighted


calf,
 an
 Angus
 calf
 that's
 destined
 for


a
 feed
 lot
 eventually
 is
 selling
 between


12
 and
 $1,800
 right
 now.
 Wow.


>> And
 so
 it's
 a
 big
 revenue
 stream.


>> Doesn't
 no
 matter
 what
 size
 your
 farm


is,
 everybody
 can
 play.


>> [music]


[music]


>> So
 when
 you're
 talking
 about
 improving


uh
 sort
 of
 butter
 fat
 and
 so
 forth,
 what


is
 going
 is
 it
 selective
 breeding
 that


just
 means
 that
 you're
 more
 likely
 to


get
 a
 baby
 cow
 that
 has
 high
 levels
 of


whatever
 you're
 looking
 for?
 Like
 what


is


>> and
 better
 production
 rate?


>> Yeah.
 what
 is
 the
 source
 of
 I
 guess


higher
 yields?


>> So
 I'm
 past
 president
 of
 holing


association
 USA
 which
 is
 the
 largest


dairy
 breed
 organization
 in
 the
 world


and
 that
 source
 is
 a
 bundle
 of
 metrics.


We
 study
 a
 lot
 of
 traits.
 Uh
 certainly


the
 big
 two
 would
 be
 butter
 fat.
 Well,


big
 three
 would
 be
 butter
 fat,
 protein


and
 milk.
 But
 we
 are
 also
 looking
 at


mastitis
 resistance
 or
 that
 you
 know
 the


ability
 to
 combat
 an
 infection
 in
 the


udder.
 We're
 looking
 for
 longevity
 which


is
 a
 trait
 we
 call
 productive
 life
 or


even
 daughter
 pregnancy
 rate
 which
 is
 a


fertility
 metric.
 So
 it's
 this
 bundle
 of


better
 yields
 from
 the
 cow
 and
 reduce


costs
 from
 uh
 the
 standpoint
 of
 health


care
 and
 those
 kind
 of
 things.
 And
 right


now
 uh
 if
 you
 use
 the
 best
 group
 of


holing
 bulls
 or
 even
 jersey
 bulls
 on
 the


next
 generation
 each
 year
 we're


improving
 genetics
 $100
 per
 year.
 Prior


to
 genomics
 that
 number
 was
 like
 $13.
 So


this
 is
 like
 significant


>> wow


>> improvement
 and
 using
 natural
 uh
 science


and
 really
 doing
 a
 better
 job.


>> Sorry
 I
 started
 laughing
 at
 the
 mastitis


reference
 because


>> it's
 hilarious.


>> It's
 hilarious.
 No,
 one
 of
 the
 oldtimey


solutions
 for
 this
 in
 that
 old
 book
 was


using
 a
 bicycle
 pump
 to
 inflate
 the


cow's
 utters.


>> Huh.


>> So
 I'm
 guessing
 people
 don't
 do
 that
 so


much
 anymore.
 That
 is
 a
 true.
 We
 do
 not


do
 that
 anymore.


>> Okay.
 What
 about,
 you
 know,
 you're


talking
 about
 income
 that
 dairy
 farms


can
 generate.
 What's
 going
 on
 with
 the


actual
 input
 prices?
 Because
 it
 takes
 a


lot
 of,
 again,
 from
 reading
 this
 book,


takes
 a
 lot
 of
 feed,
 a
 lot
 of
 hay,
 a
 lot


of
 grains
 to
 actually
 get
 these
 cows


producing
 milk
 and
 also
 up
 to
 size
 if


you're
 going to
 sell
 them
 for
 beef.
 So,


the
 biggest
 costs
 on
 a
 dairy
 farm
 are


feed
 and
 labor.
 My
 wife's
 family
 was


actually
 the
 first
 to
 put
 robots
 in
 25


years
 ago
 in
 the
 United
 States
 to
 start


milking
 their
 cows.
 So,
 some
 farmers
 are


using
 robot
 technology,
 but
 that's
 not


exactly
 mainstream
 at
 this
 point.
 But


look
 at
 the
 near-term
 prices
 for
 feed.


Soybean
 and
 corn
 grain
 certainly
 in


alalfa
 are
 some
 of
 the
 core


constituents.
 Those
 prices
 are
 down.


Now,
 that's
 a
 good
 thing
 if
 you're
 a


livestock
 producer.
 Not
 a
 great
 thing
 if


you're
 a
 row
 crop
 farmer.
 The
 other


thing
 these
 days,
 37%
 of
 the
 US
 corn


crop
 actually
 goes
 to
 bofuels,
 ethanol.


So,
 there's
 byproduct
 feeds
 there
 and
 as


well
 as
 in
 the
 soybean
 space,
 we're


making
 biodiesel
 and
 one
 of
 the


byproducts
 of
 that
 is
 soybean
 meal.
 So,


the
 cow
 is
 a
 great
 recycler.
 In
 fact,


that
 four
 stomachs
 of
 the
 cow
 allow
 her


to
 eat
 a
 lot
 of
 byproduct
 feeds.
 And
 it


I've
 traveled
 I
 think
 I've
 been
 to
 48


states
 covering
 the
 dairy
 industry.
 You


know,
 I've
 seen
 tomatoes
 and
 carrots


that
 didn't
 make
 human
 grade
 food
 in


California
 get
 fed
 to
 cows.
 I've
 been
 in


Ohio
 where
 reject
 jelly
 from
 Smuckers


has
 been
 fed
 to
 cows.
 I've
 been
 to


Canada
 where
 a
 farmer
 plows
 out
 the


driveway
 next
 door
 of
 the
 plant
 that


bakes
 biscuits
 for
 McDonald's
 and
 the


reject
 biscuits
 go
 into
 what
 is
 a
 total


mixed
 ration,
 a
 TMR.
 So,
 it's
 a
 big
 food


blender.
 Mixes
 up
 all
 the
 food
 and
 the


cows
 uh
 get
 a
 blended
 diet.
 So,
 it's


kind
 of
 a
 remarkable
 story.


>> Honestly,
 a
 cow
 fed
 on
 McDonald's


biscuit.
 Sounds
 pretty
 good.


>> Sounds
 great.
 It
 sounds
 like
 a
 cow
 is


just
 an
 amazing
 machine.
 All
 of
 these


discarded
 food
 products
 go
 in
 that


people
 that
 there
 no
 other
 use
 for


because
 most
 of
 us
 don't
 have
 four


stomachs
 and
 then
 every
 year
 the
 cows


get
 better
 at
 production
 or
 you
 get


better
 at
 producing
 higher
 producing


cows.
 Sounds
 like
 a
 great
 business.


>> It
 is
 remarkable
 and
 uh
 that's
 why
 even


though
 uh
 milk
 is
 a
 product
 that
 is
 very


consistent,
 every
 farm
 is
 different
 and


how
 every
 they
 approach
 it.
 You
 know,


there's
 very
 there's
 similarities
 to
 it,


but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 regional


differences
 as
 well.


>> Wait.
 Okay.
 So,
 cows
 might
 be
 amazing


machines.
 Amazing
 machines.
 Machines.


Thank
 you.
 I
 had
 to
 get
 at least
 one
 pun


in
 there.


>> But
 the
 dairy
 industry
 we
 hear
 has
 been


challenged,
 right?
 So,
 consumption
 has


been
 going
 down.
 I
 think
 I
 read


somewhere
 it's
 down
 40%
 in
 the
 US
 since


1975,
 something
 like
 that.
 profit


margins
 are
 still
 pretty
 compressed.


Prices
 seem
 to
 be
 on
 basically
 it's
 a


race
 to
 the
 bottom
 and
 so
 you've
 kind
 of


seen
 a
 lot
 of
 consolidation
 of
 the


smaller
 farms
 into
 these
 big
 dairy


conglomerates.
 Is
 that
 the
 story
 there?


>> Well,
 I
 want
 to
 back
 up
 first
 though.


Dairy
 consumption
 is
 actually
 at
 the


highest
 level
 it's
 been
 in
 40
 years
 and


we
 measure
 that.
 We
 have
 some
 really


good
 USDA
 data
 on
 that.
 But
 if
 you
 look


at
 near-term,
 you
 know,
 we
 started
 out


talking
 about
 fair
 life.
 That's
 uh


Coca-Cola's
 newest
 $1
 billion
 brand.
 If


you
 look
 at
 yogurt


year-over-year,
 it's
 up
 almost
 10%.
 One


of
 the
 big
 stories
 in
 the
 yogurt


category
 is
 u
 certainly
 Shabbani.
 And
 I


would
 h
 half
 of
 the
 sales
 of
 yogurt


these
 days
 are
 Greek
 yogurt,
 which
 are


high
 protein
 yogurt.
 Another
 category


that's
 been
 exploding,
 it's
 we
 made


grandma's
 cottage
 cheese
 hip
 again.
 And


cottage
 cheese
 is
 up
 for
 cottage
 cheese


is
 great.
 thought
 it
 it
 always
 feels


like
 it
 should
 have
 a
 moment
 more
 like


Greek
 yogurt.
 It's
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is


cottage
 cheese
 year."
 Is
 it
 finally


happening?


>> It
 it
 is.
 And
 people
 can't
 make
 it
 fast


enough.
 I
 was
 actually
 talking
 to
 a


dairy
 processor
 at
 a
 Wisconsin
 cheese


makers
 meeting
 just
 last
 week
 when
 it


comes
 to
 yogurt.
 And
 one
 of
 his


customers
 said,
 "Can
 you
 get
 me
 more?"


And
 he
 goes,
 "Well,
 not
 until
 next


year."
 And
 he
 goes,
 "Well,
 just
 send
 me


whatever
 you
 can.
 It's
 those
 products


are
 very
 tight
 right
 now."
 And
 then


cheese
 consumption
 is
 at
 an
 all-time


high
 actually
 at
 40
 pounds
 per
 person


per
 year
 per
 capita.
 So
 those
 are
 some


big
 growth
 areas.
 What
 you're
 probably


seeing
 Tracy
 though
 is
 uh
 the
 story
 on


fluid
 milk.
 In
 the
 1970s
 the
 average


American
 drank
 30
 gallons
 a
 year
 and
 now


are
 probably
 closer
 to
 19
 gallons.
 One


of
 the
 things
 for
 fluid
 milk
 is
 it's


hitched
 to
 dry
 breakfast
 cereal


compliments
 to
 one
 another
 and
 in
 fact


onethird
 of
 all
 fluid
 milk
 it's
 consumed


on
 dry
 breakfast
 cereal
 and
 that


category
 has
 not
 been
 going
 well.
 But


then
 you
 flip
 over
 to
 these
 the
 core


power
 which
 is
 really
 a
 high
 protein


milkshake
 and
 that
 is
 not
 actually


tracked
 in
 the
 fluid
 beverage
 category.


It's
 considered
 a
 different
 product.
 We


have
 seen
 consolidation
 in
 the
 dairy


industry.
 There's
 fewer
 dairy
 farms
 each


year.
 But
 the
 interesting
 thing
 is
 I


graduated
 college
 in
 1995.
 While
 dairy


farm
 numbers
 are
 down,
 the
 number
 of


dairy
 cows
 are
 the
 same
 essentially


about
 9.3
 million.
 But
 milk
 production


from
 those
 cows
 is
 up
 45%
 during
 that


time.
 just
 speaks
 to
 the
 uh
 efficiency


of
 the
 dairy
 cow
 and
 what
 things
 are


taking
 place
 on
 the
 dairy
 farm.


>> My
 intuition
 is
 correct
 that
 within
 the


liquid
 milks
 category,
 we've
 sort
 every


everything
 in
 society
 has
 become
 so


polarized
 and
 everyone
 loves
 extremes


and
 we
 see
 it
 in
 politics.
 We
 see
 it
 in


everywhere.
 This
 is
 well
 known
 people
 no


one
 likes
 the
 middle
 ground
 anymore


within
 the
 liquid
 milk
 category.
 Has


everyone
 sort
 of
 has
 gone
 to
 the
 extreme


ends?
 They
 want
 the
 highfat
 milk
 or
 the


skim
 leaving
 that
 good
 old
 2%
 milk,
 the


missing
 middle.


>> That
 that's
 a
 very
 interesting
 question,


Joel.
 What's
 taking
 place
 in
 fluid
 milk?


I
 three
 big
 trends.


>> Okay.


>> Protein.
 So
 products
 like
 Fair
 Life.


>> Another
 one
 is
 lactosefree.
 A
 new
 milk


plant
 going
 up
 today
 will
 have
 membrane


technology
 in
 to
 do
 reverse
 osmosis.
 And


about
 everybody
 on
 the
 new
 milks
 are


pulling
 out
 lactose.
 And
 you
 got
 to


remember
 about
 onethird
 of
 Americans
 are


probably
 lactose
 intolerant,
 about
 120


million.
 So
 let's
 make
 a
 product
 that


they
 uh
 can
 enjoy.
 And
 then
 in
 the


traditional
 milk
 categories,
 you're


absolutely
 right.
 Whole
 milk
 is
 about


the
 only
 one
 that's
 growing
 right
 now.


Skim,
 which
 is
 basically
 fat-ree,
 and


the
 other
 percentages
 are
 down.
 You


know,
 the
 dietary
 guidelines
 for


Americans
 that
 USDA
 and
 FDA
 uh
 do
 every


five
 years
 haven't
 really
 changed
 their


guidance
 on
 fat.
 But
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


research
 out
 there
 that
 said
 the
 fats
 uh


saturated
 fats
 found
 in
 dairy
 and
 animal


protein
 like
 beef
 and
 pork
 and
 poultry,


fish
 too,
 seafood
 are
 actually
 good
 for


you.
 And
 so
 there
 are
 people
 already


voting
 with
 their
 pocketbooks
 this


category.
 One
 thing
 we
 learned
 from


previous
 episodes
 on,
 I
 guess,
 trendy


drinks
 of
 the
 moment
 is
 the
 importance


of
 shelf
 placement
 in
 grocery
 stores.


And
 I
 have
 to
 admit,
 when
 I'm
 buying


milk
 at
 a
 grocery
 store,
 I
 basically


just
 buy
 what's
 at
 eye
 level.
 I
 do
 buy


whole
 milk,
 though.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 the
 preference.
 But


how
 important
 is
 um
 placement
 for
 a


product
 like
 milk
 which
 generally
 would


be
 considered
 a
 staple
 and
 perhaps


doesn't
 have
 as
 much
 brand
 loyalty
 as


some
 other
 things.


>> Yeah,
 it
 well
 there's
 a
 reason
 in
 the


grocery
 aisle
 if
 you
 look
 at
 if
 you
 walk


through
 your
 grocery
 aisle
 the
 next
 time


after
 listening
 this
 podcast
 dairy
 is


often
 in
 the
 back
 of
 the
 store
 because


dairy
 is
 in
 like
 n
 over
 95%
 of


households.
 So,
 it's
 uh
 a
 routinely


purchased
 product
 and
 that's
 part
 of
 the


uh
 placement
 situation.
 Now,
 about
 5


years
 ago,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 p
 plant


plant-based
 beverages
 were
 making


inroads
 and
 those
 sales
 are
 actually


down
 now.
 People
 consumers
 in
 my


intuition
 are
 looking
 for
 clean
 labels


and
 they
 want
 to
 see
 ingredients
 that


they
 can
 understand.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


been
 part
 of
 the
 changing
 tide
 in
 the


dairy
 space
 as
 well.
 And
 it's


interesting
 when
 you
 look
 at
 it
 and
 you


think
 about
 we're
 just
 past
 the
 10y
 year


anniversary
 now
 of
 Coca-Cola
 and
 Select


Milk
 and
 Fairlife
 partnership.
 Now


there's
 others
 that
 are
 looking
 into


that
 space.
 You
 know
 PepsiCo
 has


announced
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a


their
 Propel
 water
 brand
 is
 going
 to


have
 a
 clear
 protein
 in
 it
 that
 has
 20


grams
 of
 protein
 and
 they're
 also


reformulating
 their
 muscle
 milk
 and


they're
 going
 to
 have
 dairybased
 protein


in
 that
 category
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 when


you
 go
 to
 places
 like
 Costco
 or
 Walmart,


the
 a
 dairy
 is
 just
 not
 found
 in
 the


dairy
 aisle
 anymore.
 It's
 shelf
 stable.


It
 could
 be
 in
 the
 health
 food
 section.


It
 could
 be
 in,
 you
 know,
 adult


nutrition
 sections
 and
 those
 kind
 of


things.
 And
 so,
 it's
 expanding
 beyond


its
 traditional
 role
 because
 of
 these


high
 protein
 beverages.
 And
 also
 I
 you


if
 you're
 looking
 for
 calcium,
 some
 of


these
 products
 are,
 you
 know,
 in
 one


serving
 can
 get
 you
 50%
 of
 that
 as
 well.


[music]


[music]


[music]


the
 way
 these
 trends
 change
 when
 it


comes
 to
 macronutrients.
 You
 know,
 some


I
 saw
 a
 tweet
 or
 something
 and
 there's


like,
 oh,
 fiber
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 new


protein.
 That's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 big


thing
 everyone
 wants.


>> We
 should
 encourage
 fiber.


>> We
 should
 probably
 encourage


>> more
 useful
 than
 I
 mean,
 Americans


consume
 a
 lot
 of
 protein
 already.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 we
 need
 more.


>> Apparently,
 we
 need
 more.
 But
 does
 the


industry
 like
 how
 long
 does
 it
 take
 the


industry
 to
 say,
 you
 know
 what,
 this
 is


a
 durable
 trend.
 We're
 actually
 going
 to


invest
 in
 the
 processing
 space
 for
 this


because
 there's
 got
 to
 be
 some
 risk.


Consumers
 are
 very
 fickle.
 Internet


health
 influencers,
 they
 may
 be
 on
 to


something
 else
 by
 next
 year.
 We're
 like,


oh
 no,
 you
 got
 to
 get
 whatever
 you
 go


back
 to
 low
 fat.
 That's
 the
 new
 hot


thing,
 etc.
 How
 do
 producers
 think
 about


their
 capital
 allocation
 budget
 when
 it


comes
 to
 playing
 on
 new
 trends
 within


consumption?
 Well,
 that's
 a
 large
 and


big
 question,
 Joe.
 And


>> you
 really
 look
 at
 the
 long-term
 trends


and
 where
 things
 are
 going.
 Tracy's


absolutely
 right.
 If
 you
 read
 some
 of


the
 research,
 fiber
 probably
 will
 be
 the


next
 followup,
 the
 protein.
 I
 hear


people
 talking
 about
 how
 do
 I
 put
 a


protein
 drink
 out
 there
 with
 fiber
 in
 it


and
 bundle
 the
 two
 together.
 You
 know,


when
 I
 was
 uh
 going
 to
 grade
 school,


there
 was
 a
 cheese
 out
 there
 called


mozzarella
 in
 the
 late
 mid
 1970s
 that


was
 only
 at
 a
 couple
 pounds
 per
 capita


consumption,
 and
 now
 it's
 the
 most


consumed
 cheese
 in
 the
 US
 largely


because
 of
 its
 relationship
 with
 pizza.


So,
 these
 mega
 trends
 can
 reshape


categories.
 You
 know,
 in
 the
 19
 Well,


let's
 back
 up
 even
 a
 little
 further.


There
 was
 a
 in
 the
 1960s
 there
 was
 an


organization
 called
 the
 Wisconsin
 Feeder


Pig
 Cooperative
 and
 how
 in
 the
 heck


would
 that
 be
 formed
 in
 Wisconsin
 when


Iowa
 is
 the
 largest
 hog
 state
 but
 what


was
 happening
 we
 didn't
 have
 the


technology


going
 back
 to
 Kurds
 and
 whey
 making


cheese
 and
 whey
 we
 could
 make
 cheese
 but


the
 byproduct
 was
 whey
 and
 in
 whey
 was


protein
 the
 most
 complete
 amino
 acid


known
 to
 humanity
 but
 cheese
 makers


would
 just
 said
 in
 a
 farmer's
 home
 would


it
 do
 something
 with
 it
 some
 would


spread
 it
 on
 fields.
 Some
 would
 feed
 it


to
 baby
 pigs.
 Well,
 we
 learned
 the
 baby


pigs
 would
 grow
 so
 fast.
 So,
 the


Wisconsin
 feeder
 pig
 co-op
 started


shipping
 two
 to
 three
 million
 feeder


pigs
 to
 Iowa
 to
 be
 finished
 with
 corn


and
 soybeans.
 Well,
 now
 we
 can
 use
 these


big
 dryers,
 just
 using
 drying
 and


harvest
 that
 way.
 In
 a
 lot
 of
 cheese


plants,
 not
 a
 lot,
 all
 the
 new
 cheese


plants
 are
 really
 going
 in
 with
 a


business
 model,
 not
 only
 to
 make
 cheese,


but
 to
 capture
 the
 whey.
 Whey
 protein


isolates
 are
 selling
 roughly
 at
 $10
 a


pound,
 which
 is
 record
 high.
 And
 so


these
 business
 models
 that
 are
 taking


place
 and
 the
 research
 to
 build
 these
 11


billion
 in
 new
 plant
 investment
 is


really
 how
 do
 we
 make
 more
 out
 of
 milk.


I
 think
 you
 know
 collagens
 and
 colostrum


and
 now
 a
 new
 one
 is
 lactopherin
 which


is
 one
 of
 the
 milk
 components
 that


really
 helps
 reduce
 inflammation.


There's
 some
 research
 out
 there,
 you


know,
 depending
 on
 the
 number
 you
 see,


there
 may
 be
 5,000,
 there
 may
 be
 6,300


somewhere
 in
 there
 unique
 molecules
 in


milk.
 And
 we
 are
 just
 beginning
 to


research
 that,
 learning
 what
 parts
 we


can
 pull
 apart
 and
 help
 humans.
 And


there's
 going
 to
 be
 more
 and
 more
 in


that
 space
 here
 in
 the
 coming
 years.
 And


that's
 all
 part
 of
 that
 investment


strategy,
 what's
 going
 to
 take
 place
 in


the
 plant.
 We're
 years
 away
 from
 some
 of


that.
 But


>> so
 one
 thing
 I
 know
 about
 farmers
 is


they're
 always
 complaining
 about


something.
 And
 no
 no
 judgment
 there.
 I'm


always
 complaining
 about
 something
 too.


Joe
 can
 attest
 to
 this.
 But
 what
 are
 the


what
 are
 the
 current
 complaints
 that


you're
 hearing
 the
 most
 from
 dairy


farms?


>> Well,
 right
 now
 near-term
 90%
 of
 milk
 in


the
 United
 States
 is
 priced
 on
 multiple


component
 pricing.
 Dairy
 farmers
 would


say
 MCP.
 So
 and
 90%
 of
 that
 pricing
 is


butter,
 fat,
 and
 protein.
 Well,
 if
 you


look
 at
 protein
 and
 butter
 fat
 as
 two


NASCARs
 on
 the
 racetrack
 from
 2000
 to


2014,
 the
 protein
 NASCAR
 always
 won.
 And


then
 as
 consumers
 started
 demanding
 more


fat,
 and
 remember
 the
 flavor
 is
 in
 the


fat.
 Butter
 fat
 won
 eight
 of
 the
 last
 10


years.
 But
 right
 now,
 we've
 made
 so
 much


butter
 fat
 that
 butter
 prices
 are
 down


not
 only
 in
 the
 US,
 but
 worldwide.
 So


that's
 changed
 the
 milk
 checks.
 So
 that


would
 be
 if
 you
 went
 to
 a
 dairy
 meeting


right
 now
 to
 be
 like
 that's
 what's
 sent


milk
 prices
 down
 here
 in
 the
 last
 60


days.
 That's
 one
 issue
 that
 is
 near
 and


top
 of
 mind.
 The
 other
 thing
 would
 be
 uh


labor.
 Of
 course
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of


people
 to
 run
 a
 dairy
 farm
 and
 the
 US


dairy
 industry
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 farmers.


Americans
 don't
 like
 doing
 dirty
 jobs


when
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 it.
 I
 on
 weekends


I
 work
 on
 our
 family
 farm.
 But
 the
 these


are
 still
 just
 like
 building
 homes.
 This


is
 very
 hands-on
 process
 here.
 And
 that


would
 be
 another
 issue
 that
 would
 be
 top


of-
 mind.
 Dairy
 farmers
 and
 you'll


always
 get
 a
 good
 conversation
 on
 the


weather.
 Farmers
 in
 general
 are
 we


always
 uh
 beholden
 to
 mother
 nature.


It's
 interesting
 you
 didn't
 say
 trade


and
 but
 partly
 like
 I
 get
 the
 impression


that
 there's
 always


>> a
 million
 little
 lawsuits
 going
 on


between
 Wisconsin
 farmers
 and
 their


friends
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the
 border


about
 some
 rules
 of
 origin
 and
 they're


not
 buying
 enough
 at
 this.
 It
 seems
 like


this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that


transcends
 every
 administration.
 They


try
 to
 hammer
 it
 out
 but
 they're
 always


like
 sort
 of
 arguing
 over
 details.


You're
 not
 fulfilling
 this.
 You're


supposed
 to
 let
 in
 this
 many
 gallons.


who
 didn't.
 What
 are
 the
 core
 persistent


issues
 that
 American
 dairy
 farmers
 feel


is
 unfair
 or
 unidal
 about
 I
 guess
 our


dairy
 trading
 relationship
 with
 Canada?


>> Joe,
 that's
 a
 great
 point
 and
 I
 should


have
 put
 it
 in
 my
 list.
 Trade
 is
 top
 of


mind.
 In
 1995,
 the
 US
 was
 essentially
 a


nonplayer
 in
 the
 global
 dairy
 exports.


And
 that's
 the
 year
 that
 NAFTA
 came


about.
 Actually
 NAFTA
 came
 about
 in
 1994


and
 in
 1995
 the
 US
 dairy
 export
 council


was
 formed
 and
 these
 days
 about
 17%
 of


the
 US
 milk
 supply
 or
 one
 out
 of
 seven


tankers
 of
 milk
 are
 actually
 exported
 as


either
 dairy
 products
 or
 ingredients


around
 the
 world.
 So
 it's
 very
 important


to
 dairy.
 We're
 actually
 having
 a
 strong


export
 year,
 but
 largely
 because
 US


dairy
 products
 and
 ingredients
 were


lower
 than
 the
 other
 two
 major


competitors.
 So
 the
 EU,
 the
 27
 countries


of
 the
 European
 Union
 are
 the
 world's


largest
 dairy
 exporters.
 They
 roughly


export
 20%
 of
 their
 milk
 production.


Then
 the
 small
 and
 mighty
 nation
 of
 New


Zealand
 is
 the
 number
 two
 exporter
 in


the
 world.
 They
 have
 5
 million
 cows
 and


5
 million
 people
 roughly
 in
 the
 size
 of


Minnesota
 and
 Wisconsin.
 So
 onethird
 of


their
 gross
 domestic
 product
 comes
 from


dairy.
 If
 you
 read
 a
 Oakuckland
 paper,


you
 would
 hear
 dairy
 at least
 weekly.


And
 then
 comes
 the
 US.
 The
 US's
 number


one
 e
 export
 customer
 is
 our
 friends


south
 of
 the
 border
 in
 Mexico.
 So
 the
 US


is
 about
 a
 $9
 billion
 export
 market
 on


dairy.
 Mexico
 is
 at
 about
 two
 billion
 of


that.
 Now,
 Canada
 is
 a
 discussion
 to


itself.
 Canada's
 milk
 supply
 is
 largely


governed
 by
 a
 quota
 system.
 So,
 dairy


farmers
 up
 there
 purchase
 the
 right
 to


sell
 milk.
 And
 in
 fact,
 in
 on
 a
 Canadian


dairy
 farm,
 the
 quota
 is
 worth
 more
 than


everything
 else.
 It's
 worth
 more
 than


the
 cows.
 It's
 worth
 more
 than
 the
 land.


It's
 worth
 more
 than
 the
 equipment
 to


make
 that
 work.
 You
 can't
 have
 a
 lot
 of


imports
 come
 in.
 So,
 there
 are
 some


things
 that
 we
 send
 north
 of
 the
 border.


butter
 being
 one
 of
 them.
 But
 when
 you


uh
 hear
 the
 headlines
 right
 now,
 of


course,
 there
 are
 other
 things
 that
 were


agreed
 upon
 in
 the
 trade
 agreement
 the


last
 time,
 the
 US,
 Mexico,
 Canada
 trade


agreement,
 and
 one
 of
 those
 largely


centers
 on
 protein
 surprisingly.


>> H
 that's
 interesting.
 So
 if
 you
 look


into
 your
 crystal
 ball
 for
 the
 future
 in


the
 next
 10
 years
 looking
 at
 the
 dairy


industry,
 what's
 going
 to
 be
 most


important
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 success
 of
 a


dairy
 farm
 or
 profitability?
 Is
 it


technology?
 Is
 it
 scale
 and


consolidation?


Is
 it
 perhaps
 branding
 and


specialization
 or
 efficiencies
 in
 the


way
 you're
 breaking
 down,
 you
 know,
 milk


into
 all
 these
 various
 products
 or
 all


of
 the
 above?
 Mhm.
 I
 think
 that's
 a


two-part
 question
 because
 you
 got
 the


dairy
 farmers
 or
 dairy
 producers
 and


then
 you
 have
 the
 dairy
 processors.


We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 use
 more
 and
 more


technology
 on
 the
 dairy
 farms.
 I
 think


coming
 back
 to
 the
 cow,
 when
 dairy


farmers
 invest
 in
 genetics,
 those


genetics
 are
 additive
 and
 they're
 so


important
 and
 if
 this
 protein
 booms


continues,
 genetics
 is
 one
 of
 the
 only


ways
 to
 improve
 it.
 We
 don't
 have
 a
 lot


of
 feeding
 practices
 in
 the
 toolbox
 in


that
 regard.
 Certainly
 AI
 and
 technology


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 artificial


intelligence
 here
 for
 the
 farmers
 out


there
 listening
 will
 be
 very
 crucial


into
 this
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 use


more
 technology
 and
 find
 ways
 to
 use


robotic
 technology.
 We're
 already
 doing


some
 of
 that
 in
 rotary
 milking
 parlor.


So
 a
 rotary
 parlor
 would
 be
 like
 a


merrygoround
 that
 the
 cows
 go
 on.
 But


when
 we
 do
 milking
 preparation
 right
 now


some
 robots
 are
 putting
 on
 te
 dip
 or
 a


sanitizer
 before
 we
 milk
 that
 cow
 which


is
 important.
 So
 those
 are
 some
 areas


the
 space
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 dairy
 farmers
 are


also
 crop
 farmers
 especially
 growing


corn
 silage
 or
 alalfa
 would
 be
 two
 big


staples
 and
 you
 know
 the
 whole
 space
 on


farm
 equipment
 would
 be
 another
 area


when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 processing
 plants.


You
 know,
 some
 of
 these
 new
 and
 modern


processing
 plants
 have
 a
 lot
 of


stainless
 steel
 and
 those
 costs
 are


going
 up.
 But
 it's
 that
 investment
 in


technology,


the
 investment
 in
 it.
 You
 know,
 all
 this


ultra
 filtered
 milk
 that
 we've
 been


talking
 about,
 too.
 You
 know,
 I
 was
 just


in
 a
 plant.
 There's
 almost
 9,000
 filters


in
 there.
 It's
 a
 very,
 it's
 a
 very
 clean


and
 good
 process,
 but
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of


investment.
 And


>> it's
 a
 materials
 heavy
 materials
 heavy


environment.


>> Yes,
 it
 is.
 All
 right,
 Corey,
 thank
 you


so
 much
 for
 coming
 on
 Odd
 Thoughts.


We're
 going to
 have
 to
 leave
 it
 there,


but
 that
 was
 so
 much
 fun.
 Love
 talking


about
 milk
 with
 you.


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 fantastic.
 I
 learned
 a


bunch
 of
 stuff.


>> Thank
 you,
 Joe
 and
 Tracy.


>> Although,
 I
 will
 say
 after
 that


conversation,
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 craving


liquid
 milk.
 I'm
 craving
 cheese.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 craving
 cheese
 right
 now
 and


butter.
 Like
 a
 nice
 piece
 I
 want
 a
 piece


of
 bread
 with
 just
 like
 go
 crazy
 with


the
 butter.
 That's
 really
 good.
 Yeah,


butter
 and
 salt.
 I
 love
 that.
 Yeah.


>> It's
 lunch
 [music]
 time.
 I
 know.


>> Yeah,
 I
 We
 need
 Yeah.
 All right.


[music]


>> I
 really
 did
 learn
 a
 lot
 from
 that


conversation.


>> No,
 that
 was
 uh
 really
 helpful.
 This
 is


one
 of
 those
 markets
 like
 many
 a
 markets


I
 think
 where
 there's
 clearly
 a
 heavy


market
 component
 and
 clearly
 a
 heavy


regulatory
 component
 as
 well.
 And
 so
 I


think
 those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 hardest
 for


me
 to
 wrap
 my
 head
 around.
 I
 didn't


realize,
 for example,
 that
 in
 Canada


that
 you
 buy
 the
 right
 to
 sell
 dairy
 and


so
 that
 just
 that
 right
 to
 sell
 into
 the


market
 becomes
 a
 very
 valuable
 asset
 in


its
 own
 right.
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a


great
 conversation.
 I'm
 also
 fascinated


by
 the
 fact
 that
 maybe
 it's
 just
 day
 one


in
 terms
 of
 learning
 about
 all
 of
 the


useful
 molecules
 in
 milk
 that
 can
 be


separated
 out
 and
 have
 some
 he
 mentioned


a
 few
 that
 I
 had
 never
 heard
 of,
 but
 the


idea
 that
 there's
 just
 more
 science


there
 to
 be
 done
 on
 learning
 what
 is


milk
 or
 what
 is
 in
 it
 that
 could
 be
 of


value.
 A
 lot
 of
 interesting
 stuff
 there.


>> No,
 the
 efficiencies
 and
 the
 values
 you


can
 ring
 out
 of
 a
 single
 product,
 the


cow,


>> kind
 of
 amazing.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 yeah.
 Again,
 I'm
 gonna
 go
 back
 to


that
 book
 just
 because
 it's
 fresh
 in
 my


mind,
 but
 one
 of
 the
 things
 it
 was


saying
 is
 if
 you
 feed
 the
 cows
 a
 bunch


of
 corn,


>> then
 they
 spit
 out
 corn
 kernels
 in
 their


manure.


>> Oh,


>> and
 you
 can
 apparently
 actually
 feed


pigs
 on
 the
 halfeaten
 corn
 kernels.


>> It's
 truly
 disgusting.


>> In
 the
 manure.
 I
 know.
 But
 it's


efficient,
 Joe.


>> It's
 interesting.
 I
 think
 what
 do
 you


call
 it?
 mixed
 something
 something
 that


you
 could
 just
 like,
 oh,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 some
 old
 biscuits
 and
 we're
 going


to
 put
 some
 tomatoes
 together
 and
 it


doesn't
 matter
 the
 cow's
 stomach
 is


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 digest
 it.
 Like
 that


is
 a
 really
 incredible
 machine
 and
 it
 is


a
 good
 reminder
 of
 how
 extraordinary


nature
 and
 biology
 are
 from
 efficiency


standpoint
 that
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 build
 a


machine
 that
 could
 separate
 do
 the


equivalent
 of
 you
 know
 four
 different


stomachs
 etc.
 It
 would
 be
 such
 an


extraordinarily
 costly
 machine


>> in
 nature
 has
 solved
 this
 for
 us
 via


hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 years
 of


evolution.
 It's
 just
 a
 very
 fascinating


thing
 to
 think
 about
 some
 of
 these
 how


efficient
 these
 processes
 have
 gotten


and
 then
 what
 scientists
 can
 do
 when


they
 learn
 more
 about
 how
 they
 work.


>> The
 cows
 are
 efficient
 themselves.
 I'm


still
 amazed
 at
 some
 of
 the
 labor
 inputs


that
 go
 into
 this.
 So,
 you
 know,
 cows


producing
 milk
 have
 to
 produce
 calves.


So,
 you
 have
 to


>> inseminate
 them.
 You
 have
 to
 take
 the


calves
 away
 from
 the
 cows
 so
 that
 the


cows
 will
 produce
 milk
 that
 you
 can


sell.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 to
 teach
 the


cows
 to
 like
 drink
 from
 either
 a
 bucket


or
 an
 artificial
 udder
 or
 whatever.
 Like


there
 there's
 a
 lot
 you
 have
 to
 do.


>> I'm
 not
 sure.
 I
 may
 have
 mentioned
 it


once
 or
 twice.
 When
 I
 was
 growing
 up
 in


the
 Midwest,
 my
 grandmother,
 her
 um


husband
 was
 a
 dairy
 and
 fruit
 farmer
 in


the
 middle
 of
 Michigan


>> and
 he
 was
 very
 big
 in
 the
 local
 sort
 of


dairy
 board
 or
 whatever
 it
 was,
 etc.
 And


when
 I
 was
 younger,
 I
 thought
 that
 was


so
 boring.
 And
 now
 I'm
 like
 get
 so
 mad.


Wish
 you
 were
 still
 around.
 I
 wish
 I
 I


have
 so
 many
 qu
 like
 if
 I
 he'd
 be
 one
 of


those
 things
 where
 I
 would
 like
 visit


him
 and
 I
 would
 like
 ask
 him
 two
 hours


of
 questions
 about
 the
 daring.
 Yeah.


Have
 him
 on
 oddlot.
 It's
 like
 one
 of


those
 people
 who
 will
 answer
 any
 of
 my


questions,
 which
 he
 would
 have if
 he
 was


a
 very
 patient,
 good
 guy.
 And
 I
 always


feel
 like,
 man,
 I
 wish
 a
 little
 bit


older,
 whatever,
 cuz
 that
 would
 have


been
 a
 very
 good
 resource.


>> Yeah,
 I
 feel
 the
 same
 way.
 My
 granddad


was
 a
 cattle
 rancher
 in
 Texas
 and


>> he
 died
 before
 I
 got
 a
 chance
 to
 ask
 him


all
 these
 questions.
 All
 I
 remember
 from


his
 cow
 industry
 is
 that
 he
 used
 to
 name


some
 of
 the
 cows
 after
 me
 and
 my
 cousin


>> and
 then
 he'd
 slaughter
 them
 and
 he'd


tell
 us
 like
 Tracy
 number
 three
 is
 no


[laughter]
 longer
 with
 us.


>> So
 there
 we
 go.


>> That's
 fun.


>> All right.
 Shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?
