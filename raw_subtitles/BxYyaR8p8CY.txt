>> Okay.
 So
 u
 thank
 you
 all.
 Uh
 the
 next


paper
 uh
 is
 going
 presented
 by
 Omar


Barbiero.
 US
 firms
 exposure
 to
 import


tariffs
 a
 comparison
 of
 the
 2018
 and


2025
 episodes.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 a
 personal
 question?


>> 25
 minutes.
 when
 you
 present
 a
 paper


like
 this
 at
 a
 research
 conference
 like


this
 Boston
 Fed
 one


>> do
 you
 get
 nervous
 and
 then
 I
 guess


adjacent
 to
 that
 like
 what
 what's
 the


best
 outcome
 for
 you
 when
 you
 present


the
 paper
 and
 what's
 the
 sort
 of


nightmare
 scenario
 would
 it
 be
 someone


like
 finding
 some
 fundamental
 error
 in


the
 methodology
 and
 like
 standing
 up
 in


the
 middle
 of
 the
 conference
 and
 being


like
 there's
 a
 serious
 problem
 here


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 many
 many
 nightmare


scenarios


Sorry,
 I
 was
 just
 clicking
 randomly
 and


then
 it
 went.
 Okay.
 [laughter]


All
 right.
 I
 would
 say
 the
 the
 worst


thing
 that
 can
 happen
 is
 that
 you
 just


say
 something
 wrong
 that
 sounds


dishonest
 almost
 like
 you're
 trying
 to


hide
 something
 like
 there's
 clearly
 a


data
 flaw
 and
 then
 you
 don't
 highlight


it
 or
 you
 don't
 you
 say
 in
 public,
 "No,


no,
 no,
 this
 is
 not
 a
 problem."
 And


everybody
 knows
 that
 no,
 it's
 it's
 a


problem.
 kind
 of
 that
 that's
 I
 think
 the


profession
 is
 built
 on
 trust
 and
 if
 you


if
 you
 lose
 that
 trust
 it's
 it's
 it's


quite
 bad.


>> That's
 Omar
 Barbierro,
 a
 senior


economist
 at
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 Bank
 of


Boston.
 He's
 getting
 ready
 to
 stand
 up


in
 front
 of
 a
 room
 full
 of
 other


economists,
 journalists,
 academics
 and


his
 employer
 and
 present
 a
 research


paper
 tracking
 the
 exposure
 of
 US


businesses
 to
 import
 tariffs.
 Uh
 this
 is


a
 paper
 uh
 written
 jointly
 with
 Slavic


uh
 Hillary
 and
 Alvaro
 who
 are
 there.


There
 happen
 to
 be
 in
 the
 room
 our


excellent
 research
 assistants
 Sophie
 and


Lilia
 also
 who
 helped
 us
 uh
 with
 this


with
 this
 paper.
 It's
 uh
 we
 we
 wrote
 it


for
 the
 conference
 is
 still
 uh
 quite


preliminary
 and
 uh
 therefore
 we
 really


value
 uh
 your
 uh
 your
 comments
 on
 this.


But
 how
 many
 individual
 pieces
 of
 data


would
 you
 say
 were
 involved
 in
 this


particular
 study?


>> Okay,
 product
 code
 they
 were
 they
 were


around
 400,000


I
 would
 say
 and
 then
 uh
 you
 have
 to


multiply
 that
 by
 many
 different


countries
 and
 so
 you
 have
 to
 keep
 track


of
 that
 matrix.
 the
 supply
 chain
 data


set
 was
 also
 quite
 fun
 because
 it's
 kind


of
 a
 network
 of
 companies
 and
 uh
 it
 it


gets
 big
 uh
 very
 very
 fast
 and
 you
 have


to
 track
 it
 over
 time
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I


mean
 we
 have
 excellent
 uh
 I
 mean
 I
 have


I
 have
 excellent
 co-authors
 we
 have


excellent
 research
 assistant
 we
 have


excellent
 you
 know
 computing
 power
 uh


thank
 god
 I
 can
 can
 help
 us
 with
 that


and
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 I


>> hundreds
 of
 thousands
 millions


>> I
 ah


Yes,
 millions.


>> We
 are
 at
 the
 Boston
 Fed's
 annual


flagship
 research
 conference.
 This
 is


the
 69th
 year
 of
 the
 event
 and
 the
 theme


for
 2025
 is
 quote
 the
 US
 economy
 in
 a


changing
 global
 landscape.
 So
 focusing


on
 how
 things
 like
 tariffs,
 geopolitical


tensions,
 industrial
 policy,
 AI,
 etc.


are
 reshaping
 US
 growth,
 inflation,
 and


the
 overall
 financial
 system.
 Clearly,


that
 is
 a
 very
 rich
 vein
 to
 mine
 for


research.
 And
 the
 format
 is
 a
 classic


central
 bank
 research
 conference.


Economists
 and
 other
 researchers
 are


invited
 to
 write
 a
 paper
 for
 the
 event.


They're
 assigned
 an
 official
 discussant


and
 then
 they
 publicly
 present
 to
 a
 room


full
 of
 their
 peers
 while
 the
 audience


gets
 a
 chance
 to
 ask
 questions
 or


sometimes
 critique.


>> Yeah.
 You
 say
 it's
 a
 classic
 central


bank
 research
 conference,
 but
 we've


never
 actually
 been
 to
 one,
 I
 don't


think.
 Right.
 It
 felt
 like
 a
 totally
 new


environment.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 true.
 We
 have
 gone
 to
 Jackson


Hole
 for
 the
 past
 few
 years,
 which
 is


probably
 the
 most
 famous
 Fed
 research


conference,
 but
 it's
 famous
 because
 the


Fed
 chair
 usually
 makes
 a
 speech
 and


that
 gets
 all
 the
 attention.
 We've
 never


actually
 been
 in
 the
 room
 at
 Jackson


Hole
 where
 they
 discuss
 the
 research


papers
 being
 presented
 because
 the
 Fed


only
 allows
 a
 certain
 number
 of


journalists
 into
 the
 room.


>> The
 room.


>> The
 room.


>> The
 room.
 Also,
 I
 think
 it's
 unfair


Kansas
 City
 Fed
 gets
 to
 hold
 their


conference
 in
 the
 most
 beautiful
 place


on
 earth


>> instead
 of
 Kansas
 City


>> in
 the
 middle
 of
 August.
 And
 then
 the


Boston
 Fed,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 their
 choice,


but
 the
 Boston
 Fed
 has
 theirs
 in
 Boston,


which
 is
 lovely.
 We
 both
 had
 a
 great


time.
 But
 November


>> it
 it
 was
 very
 cold.
 Well,
 the
 upshot
 is


that
 this
 time
 we
 were
 actually
 in
 the


proverbial
 room.
 So
 for
 the
 first
 time


we
 got
 to
 really
 experience
 and
 learn


what
 an
 economic
 research
 conference


actually
 is.


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 actually
 very
 key
 because


if
 you
 sort
 of
 like
 wonder
 so
 okay


Jerome
 Paul
 says
 something
 about
 you


know
 the
 expected
 relationship
 between


tariffs
 and
 inflationary
 but
 where
 did


these
 ideas
 come
 from?
 Where
 are
 these


assertions,
 predictions
 and
 so
 forth?
 It


comes
 from
 academic
 research.
 It
 comes


from
 the
 research
 backing
 that
 up.
 These


conferences
 are
 where
 the
 macro
 ideas


sort
 of
 actually
 collide
 with
 real
 world


data.


>> Yeah.
 Another
 way
 of
 thinking
 about
 it,


it
 is
 where
 the
 first
 serious
 drafts
 of


tomorrow's
 policy
 debates
 are
 aired.
 And


we're
 going
 to
 give
 you
 a
 front
 row
 seat


to
 experience
 what
 those
 initial
 drafts


and
 debates
 are
 actually
 like.
 Welcome


to
 the
 Boston
 Fed's
 69th
 annual
 flagship


economic
 conference.


[music]


When
 you
 do
 research
 at
 the
 regional


bank,
 at
 the
 board
 or
 at
 the
 BIS,
 you
 do


policy.
 By
 policy,
 we
 mean,
 you
 know,


you
 advise
 your
 principles.
 In
 our
 case,


that's
 Susan
 Collins,
 the
 president
 and


CEO
 of
 the
 Boston
 Fed.
 preparations
 for


the
 FOMC
 meeting
 for
 public
 engagements.


>> That
 is
 Egon
 Sakryek.
 He's
 director
 of


the
 research
 department
 at
 the
 Boston


Fed
 and
 he's
 the
 one
 who
 actually
 puts


this
 event
 together


>> and
 he's
 Omar's
 boss.


>> Yeah.
 And
 he's
 Omar's
 boss,
 right?
 He


also
 gets
 to
 choose
 the
 broad
 theme
 of


the
 conference.


>> We've
 lived
 in
 a
 particular
 global


order,
 rulesbased,
 international
 system,


globalizations,


trade
 integrations.
 We
 just
 took
 those


things
 for
 granted
 for
 decades
 and
 we're


now
 grappling
 with
 monumental
 change
 and


we
 lack
 models.
 We
 lack
 theoretical


frameworks
 to
 understand
 these
 changes.


You
 you've
 heard
 many
 debates
 about
 this


data
 is
 no
 good.
 This
 is
 the
 sausage.


Don't
 eat
 it.
 Right?
 And
 how
 does
 one
 go


about
 it?
 So
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 it's
 just


really
 I
 mean
 it's
 an
 exciting
 time
 for


researchers
 because
 we
 have
 great


questions.
 But
 I
 think
 it
 also


underscores
 of
 just
 how
 little
 we
 really


know
 and
 and
 and
 how
 challenging
 it
 is


then
 to
 to
 make
 policy
 recommendations


in
 the
 in
 this
 in
 the
 period
 of
 such


change.
 You
 know
 the
 way
 the
 conference


a
 conference
 like
 that
 comes
 together
 is


you
 know
 we
 sit
 together
 my
 my
 my
 team


of
 researchers
 we
 we
 try
 to
 pick
 a
 topic


that
 would
 obviously
 be
 timely
 relevant


to
 policy
 makers.
 We
 confer
 with
 Susan


and
 then
 so
 forth.
 We
 look
 you
 know
 and


so
 forth.
 So
 once
 we
 once
 we
 kind
 of


zero
 in
 on
 what
 the
 topic
 is,
 we
 then


have
 to
 identify
 the
 contributors
 uh
 to


this.
 We
 have
 a
 certain
 idea
 of
 what
 we


want
 different
 sessions
 to
 be.
 Then
 we


get
 uh
 either
 academics
 or
 you
 know


contributors
 to
 write
 papers
 for
 this.


But
 you
 know
 uh
 academics
 researchers


write
 what
 they
 want
 to
 write.
 So


sometimes
 there's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 you
 know


say
 say
 you
 know
 gentlemanlike
 distance


between
 the
 blurp
 and
 the
 ultimate
 uh


paper
 that
 gets
 written
 but
 that's
 all


right
 we've
 always
 seen
 this
 this
 is


very
 very
 standard
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 the


idea
 is
 then
 is
 to
 the
 discussence
 the


role
 of
 a
 discussant
 then
 is
 to
 kind
 of


uh
 bring
 that
 paper
 and
 provide
 some


context
 and
 you
 know
 try
 to
 try
 to
 you


know
 fit
 it
 into
 the
 general
 theme.
 So


this
 particular
 conference
 the
 theme
 has


changed
 right
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we


keep
 saying
 but
 I
 think
 is
 true
 is
 we


are
 living
 through
 capital
 age
 history


here
 we
 have
 the
 tariffs
 from
 the
 Trump


administration
 the
 reversal
 of


globalization
 new
 geopolitical
 risks
 AI


all
 of
 it


>> right
 and
 we're
 also
 still
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 stuff
 like
 what
 happened
 in


relatively
 recent
 years
 why
 did


inflation
 actually
 spike
 during
 the


pandemic
 we're
 also
 in
 this
 new
 era
 of


industrial
 policy
 and
 we're
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 what
 that
 means
 for
 the


economy
 if
 we
 actually
 want
 to
 do
 the


stuff
 like
 make
 semiconductors
 or
 build


small
 modular
 nuclear
 reactors,
 we
 have


to
 have
 some
 idea
 of
 where
 we're
 going


>> and
 and
 we
 try
 to
 really
 keep
 it,
 you


know,
 I
 would
 say
 somewhat


more
 accessible.
 I
 would
 say
 a
 bit


interdisciplinary.
 We
 try
 to
 reach
 a
 bit


broader
 audience
 is
 somewhat
 atypical


conference.
 You
 know,
 your
 typical


economic
 research
 [snorts]
 conference


would
 feature
 slide
 after
 slide
 of


equations,
 graphs.
 Sorry,
 I'm
 laughing


slightly
 because
 I
 saw
 some
 equations


this
 morning
 and
 the
 speaker
 is
 like
 oh


well
 as
 you
 can
 see
 from
 this
 slide
 and


I'm
 thinking
 I
 cannot
 see
 no
 idea.


>> Right.
 Right.
 So
 you
 know
 so
 this
 is
 I


would
 say
 this
 is
 very
 light
 on
 this.
 If


you
 uh
 you
 know
 this
 is
 super
 light
 on


this
 and
 so
 forth.
 Um
 we
 we
 urge
 authors


to
 try
 to
 write
 something
 that's
 more
 I


would
 say
 policy
 relevant
 that
 that
 that


touches
 that
 can
 be
 communicated
 and


stuff
 that
 rather
 than
 very
 very


technical
 pieces
 you
 know
 that
 is
 what


the
 academic
 journals
 tend
 to
 specialize


hopefully
 it
 sparks
 it
 sparks
 an
 idea
 it


sparks
 a
 new
 paper
 you
 know
 it
 says
 ah


you
 know what
 this
 is
 an
 interesting


result
 but
 I
 have
 maybe
 better
 data
 to


do
 that
 uh
 so
 let
 me
 actually
 or
 there


was
 uh
 there
 was
 a
 testable
 implication


that
 somebody
 you
 know
 brought
 up
 let
 me


see
 if
 I
 can
 flesh
 that
 out
 because
 I


think
 I
 can
 provide
 some
 that's
 how


knowledge
 and
 conferences
 you
 know


advances
 it's
 a
 very
 organic
 a
 bit
 of
 a


messy
 type
 of
 affair
 and
 you
 know
 to
 be


honest
 many
 times
 don't
 things
 don't


they
 don't
 pan
 out
 you
 know
 uh
 I
 have


files
 and
 folders
 full
 of
 research
 ideas


that
 you
 know
 never
 went
 anywhere
 but


that
 but
 you
 try


>> and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 get
 a
 sense
 of
 that


process
 and
 the
 policy
 implications
 of


some
 of
 this
 research.
 Take
 a
 listen
 to


the
 first
 paper
 presented
 at
 the


conference.
 It's
 by
 Shbnam
 Kmley
 Oscin.


She's
 the
 Shriber
 family
 professor
 of


economics
 over
 at
 Brown
 University.


>> I
 love
 economists
 and
 their
 uh
 their


long
 titles.
 The
 John
 Maynard
 Kane's


chair
 of
 the
 Ludvig
 vine
 me's
 endowed


seed
 at
 the
 University
 of
 whatever.


>> Kane's
 chair
 at
 the
 Misi
 school
 would
 be


um
 an
 interesting
 mix.
 Anyway,
 here's


Shbnam
 presenting
 her
 paper.
 It
 is


called
 global
 networks
 risks
 and
 the
 US


economy.


>> You
 know,
 paper
 after
 paper,
 we
 realize


uh
 the
 issue
 with
 the
 conventional
 macro


open
 economy
 view.
 What
 is
 this
 view?


This
 view
 takes
 us
 as
 a
 relatively


closed
 economy
 because
 of
 the
 low
 trade


shares,
 exports
 10%
 of
 GDP,
 imports
 14%


of
 GDP.


And
 that
 of
 course
 combines
 with
 the


fact
 that
 uh
 US
 uh
 uh
 is
 uh
 governing


the
 world
 in
 terms
 of
 dollar
 dominance


and
 uh
 deep
 financial
 markets.
 And
 on


top
 of
 that
 US
 has
 a
 amazing
 central


bank
 as
 we
 are
 all
 uh
 here
 right
 now
 we


know
 that
 Federal
 Reserve
 acts
 as
 a


global
 lender
 of
 last
 resort
 uh
 when


things
 go
 south.
 The
 benchmark


implication
 of
 this
 view
 is
 that
 US
 has


limited
 exposure
 to
 global
 risks.
 We


would
 like
 to
 revisit


uh
 the
 issue
 in
 terms
 of
 asking
 directly


how
 sensitive
 the
 US
 economy
 to
 global


risks
 once
 we
 account
 for
 full
 global


trade,
 production
 and
 finance
 networks


and
 really
 think
 about
 uh
 trades
 off
 and


counterfactuals


and
 basically
 revisit
 this
 issue
 that


the
 fact
 that
 maybe
 your
 trade
 shares


are
 low.


>> We
 caught
 up
 with
 Shbnam
 after
 her


presentation
 to
 better
 understand


exactly
 what
 she's
 trying
 to
 do
 here.


All right.
 So
 yes,
 we
 found
 uh
 something


different
 uh
 because
 uh
 we
 work
 with


networks
 and
 let
 me
 explain
 what
 that


is.
 When
 you
 say
 networks
 again
 the
 the


the
 traditional
 we
 first
 going
 to
 think


about
 of
 course
 the
 trade
 networks.
 Why?


Because
 the
 trade
 networks
 directly


linked
 to
 supply
 chains
 right
 and
 we


already
 realized
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 it
 is


those
 are
 vulnerable.
 I
 mean
 you
 know


shock
 after
 shock
 starting
 with
 the


pandemic
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 told
 us
 that
 yes


maybe
 kind
 of
 our
 uh
 final
 goods
 trade


or
 just
 if
 I
 focus
 on
 manufacturing
 not


that
 big
 but
 if
 I
 look
 at
 the
 supply


chains
 value
 chains
 then
 US
 is


integrated
 to
 that
 uh
 and
 then
 that


changes
 the
 things
 because
 that
 means
 uh


even
 in
 the
 aggregate
 number
 you
 might


not
 see
 that
 big
 of
 exports
 and
 imports


there
 might
 be
 indirect
 exposure
 through


all
 those
 things
 because
 when
 you
 think


a
 network
 you
 You
 are
 linked
 through


trade.
 This
 is
 now
 where
 we
 also
 add
 to


the
 traditional
 view.
 But
 you
 also
 have


to
 think
 about
 the
 financing,
 right?
 I


mean,
 so
 the
 networks
 to
 us
 is
 trade


networks.
 Yes,
 you
 know,
 countries


buying
 and
 selling,
 sectors
 buying
 and


selling,
 firms
 buying
 and
 selling
 from


each
 other,
 but
 also
 financial
 networks.


I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 investors
 investing
 in


companies
 in
 other
 countries,
 you
 know,


the
 supply
 chains
 financed
 by
 different


investors
 in
 other
 countries.
 And
 on
 top


of
 that,
 of
 course,
 the
 production,


right?
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 so
 a
 a
 a a


product
 right
 now
 is
 assembled
 in
 one


country
 designed
 in
 another
 country


manufacturing
 in
 another
 country
 with


parts
 coming
 from
 many
 many
 countries


and
 skills
 and
 knowledge
 also
 coming


from
 many
 many
 countries.
 So
 when
 you


have
 this
 type
 of
 a
 comprehensive
 view


of
 the
 network
 global
 network
 as
 trade


production
 and
 finance
 then
 I
 think
 US


uh
 becomes
 uh
 very
 vulnerable
 to
 global


shocks
 and
 global
 risks.
 So
 you
 could


see
 why
 this
 would
 be
 an
 important
 area


of
 research
 for
 the
 Fed.
 Right.


>> Right.
 And
 the
 conventional
 thinking
 has


always
 been
 that
 the
 US
 is
 kind
 of


insulated
 from
 global
 shocks
 because


it's
 so
 big
 because
 the
 dollar
 is
 so


dominant.
 External
 factors
 it's
 thought


don't
 really
 affect
 the
 US
 economy
 so


much


>> right
 and
 also
 we
 don't
 actually
 export


that
 much
 relatively
 speaking


>> right
 we
 import.
 So
 that's
 the


conventional
 view.
 But
 if
 per
 Shbnam's


research,
 the
 US
 is
 in
 fact
 more
 exposed


to
 global
 shocks
 than
 previously


thought,
 if
 it's
 more
 intertwined
 with


the
 network
 of
 the
 global
 economy


through
 secondord
 effects,
 then
 policy


makers
 should
 be
 aware
 of
 that.
 Right?


>> Wasn't
 clear.
 This
 is
 an
 enormous
 body


of
 work
 spanning,
 you
 know,
 several


papers,
 hundreds
 of
 pages,
 all
 with
 many


applications
 um
 and
 scenarios.


>> That
 is
 Aaron
 Flaugh.
 He's
 a
 principal


economist
 at
 the
 Boston
 Fed
 and
 he's


also
 the
 discussant
 for
 this
 particular


paper.


>> The
 discussant
 role
 is
 really


interesting.


>> Yeah,
 this
 was
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 most


fascinating
 sort
 of
 dynamics
 which
 I


knew
 existed
 but
 didn't
 quite
 appreciate


how
 it
 works.
 So
 basically
 every


presenter
 gets
 paired
 with
 an
 official


discussant
 whose
 job
 is
 just
 to


interpret
 and
 critique
 frankly
 the
 paper


for
 a
 wider
 audience.


>> So
 those
 are
 those
 are
 my
 uh
 my
 main


comments.
 I
 do
 just
 want
 to
 emphasize


that
 what
 SENM
 is
 doing
 here
 is
 policy


relevant
 research
 you
 know
 at
 its


finest.
 It's
 our
 profession
 working
 at


its
 finest
 for
 really
 answering
 these


very
 timely
 questions
 in
 ways
 that
 that


>> authors
 are
 very
 close
 to
 the
 paper.
 You


wrote
 this,
 you
 know,
 details
 and
 you


can
 see
 in
 the
 presentations,
 right?


They
 they
 know
 inside
 out
 and
 stuff
 like


that.
 So
 they
 provide
 a
 presentation.


The
 role
 really
 what
 a
 discussant
 does


is
 sort
 of
 a
 essentially
 let
 me


translate
 what
 the
 author
 does
 for
 the


broader
 audience.
 Right?
 A
 good


discussant
 role
 is
 really
 to
 sort
 of


reframe
 the
 paper,
 pull
 out
 key


takeaways,
 and
 then
 provide
 some


constructive,
 you
 know,
 comments.


>> But,
 um,
 sometimes
 things
 get
 a
 little


awkward.


>> Definitely
 awkward,
 but,
 you
 know,


everyone
 is
 still
 very
 polite.


>> Still
 very
 polite.
 Yes.
 But
 more
 on
 that


after
 this
 break.


[music]


>> [music]


[music]


>> Let's
 go
 to
 another
 paper.
 This
 one
 is


by
 Tomaso
 Monichelli.
 He's
 a
 professor


of
 economics
 at
 University
 Bachi
 and
 his


paper
 is
 called
 Supply
 Chain


Uncertainty,
 Energy
 Prices
 and


Inflation.
 And
 it
 is
 actually
 about
 one


of
 our
 favorite
 topics,
 Joe.
 Supply


chains.
 No,
 that's
 right
 because
 uh


that's
 exactly
 right.
 So
 supply
 chain


disruptions
 can
 uh
 sort
 of
 change
 uh
 the


state
 of
 the
 economy.
 So
 the
 environment


that's
 our
 idea
 where
 firms
 uh
 make
 uh


uh
 production
 and
 pricing
 decisions,


right?
 And
 so
 the
 key
 idea
 is
 that
 uh
 um


the
 the
 state
 of
 the
 world
 uh
 in
 which


firms
 operate,
 right?
 can
 uh
 can
 change


underlying
 and
 um
 so
 as
 economists
 we


say
 the
 the
 state
 of
 the
 economy
 changes


uh
 even
 starting
 from
 uh
 uh
 potentially


minor
 uh
 uh
 events
 uh
 along
 the
 supply


chain.
 how
 we
 make
 the
 example
 of
 this


apparently
 small
 episode
 like
 in
 the


sewers
 canal
 two
 years
 ago
 sort
 of
 a


ship
 uh
 container
 shipping
 oil
 and
 other


inputs
 got
 stuck
 for
 a
 few
 days


>> we
 remember
 it
 well
 literally
 right
 but


that
 was
 that
 episode
 sort
 of
 got


resolved
 in
 a
 few
 days
 but
 I
 didn't
 have


the
 time
 to
 show
 the
 data
 but
 then
 this


uh
 uh
 the
 effect
 on
 transportation


disruptions
 s
 okay
 along
 supply
 chains


lasted
 for
 months.
 Okay,
 so
 the
 analogy


here
 is
 think
 of
 a
 airport,
 okay,
 like
 a


hub,
 okay,
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 flight.
 So
 now


many
 airports
 uh
 uh
 h
 function
 as
 hubs


okay
 of
 many
 flights
 coming
 from


different
 directions
 and
 right
 you
 can


have
 a
 disruption
 like
 a
 single
 delay
 on


a
 single
 flight
 in
 the
 in
 the
 in
 the
 hub


but
 then
 this
 propagates
 you
 know
 uh


along
 the
 day
 and
 then
 across
 many


different
 flights
 and
 and
 amplifying
 the


delay
 downstream


>> a
 cascade
 effect.


>> Yes.
 So
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 Tomasu's


research
 is
 this
 sort
 of
 very
 important


question.
 Are
 supply
 chain
 disruptions


real?
 Are
 they
 a
 real
 thing?
 Or
 are
 they


simply
 manifestations
 or
 symptoms
 of


excess
 demand
 maybe
 caused
 by
 too
 much


fiscal
 stimulus?


>> Yeah.
 So
 after
 the
 pandemic,
 a
 lot
 of


people
 criticized
 the
 government
 for


handing
 out
 checks
 to
 people
 and


businesses
 helping
 supposedly
 to
 fan


inflation.
 But
 actually,
 if
 small
 supply


chain
 disruptions
 can
 reverberate
 for


longer
 than
 previously
 thought
 through


energy
 prices
 or
 whatever,
 then
 per


Tamaso's
 research,
 they
 can
 be
 a
 pretty


important
 source
 of
 inflation.
 And
 the


important
 thing
 is
 that
 it's
 not
 the


size
 of
 the
 supply
 chain
 shock
 that


matters.
 It's
 the
 actual
 volatility


itself,
 the
 uncertainty
 that
 matters
 for


inflation.


>> Right?
 So
 again,
 I
 think
 you
 know,
 you


could
 see
 why
 this
 would
 be
 of
 interest


to
 policy
 makers.
 Even
 5
 years
 after
 the


pandemic,
 we're
 still
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 exactly
 what
 happened
 and
 uh
 we'll


probably
 be
 researching
 that
 for
 years.


>> Totally.
 Yes.
 So
 here
 in
 the
 in
 our


research,
 we
 emphasize
 the
 interaction.


So
 the
 complimentarity
 between
 uh
 you


know
 uh
 shocks
 to
 let's
 say
 the
 price
 of


oil.
 Okay.
 That
 typically
 central
 banks


look
 at
 right.
 But
 they
 they
 have
 a
 a


typical
 attitude.
 Let's
 say
 normal


times.
 If
 there
 are
 oil
 shocks,
 yes,
 we


should
 monitor
 that
 those
 shocks
 don't


feed
 are
 not
 too
 persistent.
 They
 don't


feed
 onto
 inflation
 expectations
 and
 so


on.
 But
 their
 attitude
 is
 typically


let's
 look
 through.
 Okay,
 this
 uh
 oil


price
 all
 oil
 prices
 jump
 around
 uh
 uh


very
 much
 uh
 in
 markets.
 But
 here
 we
 are


saying
 even
 the
 same
 uh
 uh
 original
 uh


let's
 say
 oil
 price
 shocks
 or
 energy
 gas


price
 shocks
 they
 can
 have
 a
 very


different
 amplified
 effects
 on


inflation.
 Okay.
 Depending
 on
 whether


the
 state
 of
 supply
 chain
 is
 disrupted


or
 not.
 Okay.
 So
 it's
 it's
 really
 the


intera.
 So
 it's
 not
 really
 that
 we


believe
 that
 we
 emphasize
 supply
 chain


shocks.
 We
 say
 typical
 supply
 shocks


like
 oil
 shocks
 or
 gas
 price
 shocks,


right?
 They
 can
 get
 really
 amplified
 and


in
 a
 very
 persistent
 way
 if
 the


underlying
 conditions
 of
 supply
 chains


are
 disruptive.
 So
 that
 that
 state
 of


the
 economy
 should
 be
 monitored
 and
 in


in
 those
 states
 of
 the
 world
 the
 central


bank
 should
 be
 very
 very
 reactive
 way


more
 reactive
 to
 uh
 oil
 shocks
 or
 energy


price
 shocks
 than
 in
 periods
 where


supply
 chain
 disruptions
 are
 minimal.


>> So
 that's
 the
 basic
 thrust
 of
 the
 paper


and
 the
 data
 seemed
 to
 bear
 Tomaso's


thesis
 out
 but
 things
 got
 a
 little


awkward
 when
 it
 was
 time
 for
 the


discussion.


>> Hi
 I'm
 Ludvik
 Stra.
 I'm
 a
 professor
 of


economics
 at
 Harvard.
 I'm
 a
 quantitative


macroeconomist.
 So
 I
 try
 to
 build
 models


that
 describe
 the
 macroeconomy
 and
 can


be
 used
 for
 policy
 analysis
 and


forecasting.
 I'm
 a
 discussant
 of
 a
 paper


on
 supply
 chain
 uncertainty
 and
 energy


shocks
 and
 how
 those
 two
 relate
 to
 the


postcoid
 inflation
 episode.


>> Right.
 As
 Lidvig
 puts
 it,
 being
 a


discussant
 is
 a
 pretty
 big
 commitment.


And
 we
 should
 just
 mention
 here
 that


neither
 the
 researchers
 nor
 the


discussants
 are
 getting
 paid
 for
 their


time.
 They're
 doing
 this
 for
 other


reasons.
 obviously
 to
 contribute
 to


policy,
 but
 there's
 another
 big


motivation
 that
 we'll
 get
 into
 in
 a


minute.
 So,
 here's
 Lvig.


>> So,
 not
 everybody
 has
 time
 uh
 and
 energy


to
 do
 this.
 In
 my
 case,
 I
 love
 being
 at


the
 Boston
 Fed
 and
 I'm
 close.
 So,
 so


it's
 not
 a
 big
 travel
 uh
 uh
 to
 come


here.
 And
 uh
 yeah,
 so
 I
 said
 yes.
 And
 um


you
 know
 about
 a
 month
 before
 the


conference
 you
 typically
 receive
 the


paper
 and
 then
 you
 spend
 a
 significant


amount
 of
 time
 I'd
 say
 maybe
 half
 a
 week


a
 week


>> um
 you
 know
 in
 your
 of
 your
 research


time
 with
 the
 paper
 and
 trying
 to


understand
 the
 ins
 and
 outs
 trying
 to


understand
 the
 empirics
 the
 model
 and


then
 hopefully
 give
 a
 balanced
 view
 of


the
 paper
 during
 the
 discussion


>> and
 from
 what
 we
 saw
 at
 the
 conference


it
 feels
 like
 discussions
 can
 have


different
 styles
 some
 basically


summarize
 the
 paper
 and
 explain
 why
 it's


relevant
 and
 others
 others
 you
 know


maybe
 pick
 it
 apart
 very
 critically


here's
 Levik
 talking
 about
 the


discussants


>> some
 tend
 to
 be
 more
 like
 what
 you
 just


mentioned
 more
 like
 the
 latter
 that
 you


know
 pick
 apart
 papers
 and
 kind
 of
 come


across
 as
 a
 little
 bit
 destructive


rather
 than
 constructive
 you
 know
 the


the
 last
 discussion
 at
 the
 conference


was
 a
 lot
 more
 constructive
 for
 example


and
 would
 be
 you
 know
 building
 off
 the


author's
 results
 and
 you
 showing
 them


what
 they
 could
 do
 next
 with
 with
 the


paper.
 Some
 are
 very
 very
 kind
 and
 just


praise
 the
 results,


>> which
 I
 I
 tend
 to
 I
 tend
 to
 try
 to
 be
 in


somewhere
 in
 between.
 You
 know,
 I
 tend


to
 shed
 some
 critical
 light
 on
 the
 the


author's
 results
 if
 that,
 you
 know,
 is


something
 that
 I
 think
 helps
 understand


the
 paper,
 but
 I
 also
 want
 to
 be


constructive
 and
 I
 want
 to
 be
 kind
 to


the
 authors,
 too.
 So,
 you
 know,
 you
 want


to
 kind
 of
 balance
 those
 two
 sides,
 I


guess.
 and
 Ludvig
 did
 shed
 some
 um


critical
 light
 on
 Tomaso's
 research.


>> Suggestions
 for
 improvement,
 we
 can
 say,


>> right?
 Suggestions
 for
 improvement,


right?
 That's
 a
 a
 a
 good
 way
 of
 putting


it.


>> So,
 as
 the
 economy
 reopened,
 as
 we
 had


ample
 fiscal
 stimulus,
 and
 I
 tend
 to


think
 that
 that
 means
 we
 ran
 up
 a


marginal
 cost
 curve,
 meaning,
 you
 know,


costs
 went
 up
 just
 because
 there
 was
 a


lot
 of
 demand.
 And
 so,
 bottlenecks


emerged,
 um
 ports
 got
 clogged.
 And
 I


think
 that
 alone
 can
 lead
 to
 an
 increase


in
 what
 looks
 like
 supply
 chain
 issues


even
 though
 they're
 not
 really
 the
 root


cause
 of
 things.
 Now,
 I
 still
 think
 this


paper
 has
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 merits
 to
 it,
 but


you
 know,
 I
 tend
 to
 think
 that
 not
 all


that
 looks
 like
 an
 energy
 shock
 is


really
 truly
 a
 shock
 rather
 than
 just
 a


con
 a
 consequence
 of
 of
 increased


demand.
 Tomaso
 also
 used
 the
 Baltic
 Dry


index
 as
 a
 proxy
 for
 shipping
 cost,


which
 as
 anyone
 who
 has
 spent
 a
 bit
 of


time
 on
 finance
 Twitter
 will
 tell
 you
 is


an
 index
 that
 gets
 criticized
 a
 lot.


>> Exactly.
 And
 then
 if
 if
 it's
 just
 one


episode
 in
 that
 time
 series
 that's
 kind


of
 responsible
 for
 some
 of
 the
 results,


then
 I
 would
 worry
 about
 that.
 Now,
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 exactly
 what's


going
 on,
 but
 I
 did
 play
 around
 a
 little


bit
 and
 it
 was
 not
 as
 robust
 as
 as,
 you


know,
 I
 was
 maybe
 hoping
 it
 or
 they
 were


maybe
 hoping
 it
 to
 be.


>> So,
 Tracy,
 speaking
 of
 Twitter,
 you


know,
 look,
 both
 you
 and
 I
 are
 used
 to


getting
 criticism,
 right?
 But
 even
 if


you're
 used
 to
 it,
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be


pretty
 uncomfortable
 to
 have
 your
 work


sort
 of
 publicly
 criticized
 by
 one
 of


your
 peers
 in
 front
 of
 a
 big
 group
 of


peers.


>> Yeah,
 I
 would
 think
 so,
 too.
 Although,


Tomaso
 actually
 seemed
 pretty
 fine
 with


it.


>> No.
 Okay.
 So
 that
 that
 you
 learn
 uh


learn
 out
 of
 experience
 through
 time


right
 that
 you
 have
 to
 filter
 the


reaction
 of
 the
 audience
 and
 get
 the
 the


good
 and
 the
 bad
 signals.
 So
 first
 of


all
 I
 had
 great
 comments
 uh
 very
 useful


I
 both
 myself
 and
 my
 co-author
 are
 very


happy
 uh
 the
 discussion
 was
 fantastic
 I


I
 know
 him
 he's
 a
 fantastic
 researcher


he's
 one
 of
 the
 best
 uh
 macroeconomist
 I


admire
 his
 researchers
 I
 was
 very
 happy


that
 he
 [snorts]
 they
 was
 pleased
 with


the
 with
 the
 with
 the
 paper
 but
 also
 the


the
 audience
 had
 very
 interesting
 uh


comments
 that
 uh
 know
 materially
 will
 be


very
 useful
 for
 uh
 for
 uh
 uh
 keeping
 up


with
 the
 research
 and
 and
 again
 uh
 M


sometimes
 you
 get
 some
 more
 aggressive


comments.
 Uh
 but
 you
 know
 there
 is
 a


there
 is
 a
 uh
 sort
 of
 there
 there
 is
 an


interesting
 uh
 role
 uh
 type
 of
 uh
 uh


dynamics
 uh
 that
 happens
 in
 academic


conferences
 that
 you
 have
 to


internalize.
 Yeah,


>> Tracy,
 I
 really
 do.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 to
 one


of
 those
 workshops
 that
 you
 hear
 about


where
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 young
 the
 young


student
 or
 the
 young
 professor,
 maybe


someone
 applying
 for
 a
 job,
 they're


presenting
 their
 paper
 and
 then
 the
 old


professor
 in
 the
 back
 of
 the
 room
 sort


of
 puts
 on
 a
 big
 show
 and
 humiliates


them,
 bring
 up
 all
 these
 points.


>> That
 is
 a
 very
 interesting
 point
 because


Tomaso
 says
 the
 days
 of
 older
 professors


publicly
 humiliating
 younger
 students


are
 pretty
 much
 over.


>> That
 happens
 uh
 in
 sort
 of
 a
 behind


secret
 doors
 in
 a
 way.
 No,
 but
 but
 uh


especially
 as
 of
 late
 uh
 the
 profession


is
 discussing
 that
 a
 lot.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 we
 we
 now
 are
 are
 becoming


much
 more
 aware
 that
 the
 climate
 uh


especially
 in
 economics
 much
 more
 than


in
 other
 social
 sciences
 or
 hard


sciences
 that
 the
 climate
 during


seminars
 during
 presentations
 especially


within
 closed
 door
 seminars
 might
 be
 uh


might
 be
 uh
 sort
 of
 not
 conducive
 for


for
 for
 younger
 researchers
 to
 actually


take
 risks
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 and
 learn
 from


the
 audience.
 So
 we
 are
 becoming
 way


more
 mindful
 that
 it
 is
 very
 important


to
 to
 you
 know
 to
 keep
 a
 to
 keep
 a


civilized
 climate
 in
 in
 in
 research


environments.


>> Speaking
 of
 civilized
 climates,
 we


should
 just
 mention
 that
 things
 can
 get


pretty
 heated
 in
 the
 public
 discussion


too,


>> right?
 So
 this
 is
 also
 part
 of
 it
 where


attendees
 get
 a
 chance
 to
 ask
 questions


or
 often
 make
 their
 own
 uh
 points
 about


the
 papers
 being
 questioned.
 Many
 uh


many
 statements
 in
 the
 form
 of
 a


question.


>> Yeah,
 lots
 of
 that.
 And
 things
 got
 a


little
 um
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 combative


but
 loud.
 They
 were
 loud.
 Things
 got


kind
 of
 loud
 after
 a
 paper
 was
 presented


on
 the
 idea
 of
 policy
 tradeoffs.
 So


trade-offs
 between
 geopolitical
 risks


and
 economic
 risks.


>> Perhaps
 it's
 too
 early
 to
 tell.
 Standard


models
 of
 the
 type
 that
 uh
 that
 Shnam


talked
 about
 without
 the
 nominal


rigidities
 would
 also
 predict
 optimal


uniform
 tariffs
 that
 are
 very
 high
 20


40%
 range.
 So
 the
 current
 environment
 uh


looks
 pretty
 good.


>> The
 voice
 you
 hear
 is
 Paul
 Antress.
 He


is
 a
 professor
 at
 Harvard
 giving
 the


keynote
 address
 on
 the
 first
 day
 of
 the


conference.


>> According
 to
 this
 models,
 we
 are
 in
 a


sweet
 spot.
 I'm
 not
 so
 sure.
 Why?


Because
 [snorts]
 the
 standard
 models
 are


models
 that
 I
 think
 have
 features
 uh


that
 I
 I
 think
 are
 not
 in
 line
 with
 many


of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 see
 when
 I
 look
 at


the
 data.
 his
 presentation,
 the
 evolving


role
 of
 the
 United
 States
 in
 global


value
 chains.
 It
 touched
 on
 some
 of
 the


same
 areas
 that
 Shbnum
 had
 covered


earlier.
 And
 the
 beauty
 of
 a
 conference


like
 this
 is
 that
 she
 was
 sitting
 right


in
 the
 audience
 uh
 and
 she
 was
 able
 to


weigh
 in
 right
 then
 and
 there.


>> You
 just
 raised
 a
 couple
 issues
 and
 then


I
 then
 I
 realized
 maybe
 I
 wasn't
 clear


during
 my
 presentation.
 I
 fully
 agree
 on


the
 whole
 firm
 level
 and
 how
 the
 input


output
 uh
 data
 we
 have
 is
 kind
 of
 this


sausage.
 Uh
 but
 I
 would
 disagree
 that
 we


do
 want
 to
 make
 understand
 how
 the


sausage
 made
 so
 that
 we
 can
 do
 better.


Right?
 So


>> the
 economists
 were
 fighting.


>> Well
 actually
 I
 asked
 Shabbn
 about
 this


later
 and
 here's
 what
 she
 said.


>> Well
 actually
 I
 characterized
 that
 as
 a


very
 healthy
 debate
 and
 little
 bit
 also


you
 know
 the
 artifact
 of
 these


conferences
 where
 you
 have
 25
 minutes
 to


present
 right.
 So
 I
 didn't
 have
 that


much
 time
 and
 then
 of
 course
 because
 I


didn't
 show
 the
 parts
 where
 we
 use
 the


firm
 level
 data
 and
 more
 uh
 uh
 you
 know


disciplined
 the
 macro
 model
 with
 more
 uh


you
 know
 micro
 identified
 elasticities


and
 all
 that.
 Joe,
 all
 of
 this
 raises


the
 question
 of
 why
 economists
 choose
 to


do
 this
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 And
 you


know,
 you
 spend
 a
 huge
 chunk
 of
 time


writing
 a
 paper.
 You
 probably
 have
 a
 few


research
 assistants
 that
 are
 working
 on


it
 and
 they
 could
 be
 doing
 something


else


>> and
 then
 it
 gets
 scrutinized
 this
 very


publicly.


>> I
 I
 I
 maybe
 you
 felt
 I
 was
 I
 was
 picking


on
 you.
 I
 I
 I
 didn't
 mean
 to
 do
 that.


Now,
 of
 course,
 I
 I
 take
 your
 point.
 Um


let
 me
 just
 push
 back
 though
 uh
 in
 the


sense
 that


>> obviously
 one
 of
 the
 motivations
 is
 the


policy
 aspect.
 Economists
 I
 think
 many


of
 them
 want
 to
 inform
 policy
 in
 an


accurate
 and
 useful
 way.
 That's
 pretty


obvious.
 But
 there
 was
 also
 something


that
 I
 didn't
 quite
 realize.
 Peer
 review


and
 publishing.
 People
 want
 to
 be


published.


>> Yeah.
 Look,
 I
 get
 it.
 Believe
 me,
 I
 get


it.
 Researchers,
 yes,
 they
 want
 to
 uh


influence
 policy.
 Who
 doesn't?
 But
 they


also
 want
 to
 get
 their
 papers
 rubber


stamped
 by
 other
 economists
 and
 then


published
 in
 the
 most
 prestigious


academic
 journals.
 And
 so
 one
 thing
 I


wondered
 is
 whether
 there's
 a
 tension


between,
 you
 know,
 just
 from
 the


economist
 perspective,
 is
 there
 some


sort
 of
 tension
 between
 the
 goal
 of


writing
 a
 paper
 that
 is
 actually
 useful


for
 making
 better
 policy
 or
 just
 sort
 of


maximizing
 your
 chances
 of
 getting
 into


a
 peer-reviewed
 journal?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a
 very
 fair


question
 and
 Shbnam
 talked
 about
 that


too.


>> Yes.
 No,
 [laughter]
 this
 is
 the
 story
 of


my
 life.
 So
 because
 this
 is
 this
 is
 a


very
 uh
 uh
 serious
 tension
 and
 I'm


hoping
 uh
 we
 will
 make
 the
 best
 use
 of


these
 times
 now
 we
 are
 living
 in
 to
 uh


uh
 to
 change
 this
 because
 yes


unfortunately
 academia
 uh
 publishing


values
 very
 narrow
 uh
 research
 and
 very


uh
 tightly
 defined
 specialized
 research


uh
 and
 that's
 why
 economists
 are
 in


silos
 right
 there
 There
 are
 labor


economists,
 they
 are
 macroeconomists,


they
 are
 IIO
 economists,
 international


economists,
 finance
 economists.
 And


generally
 these
 groups
 don't
 talk
 to


each
 other
 much
 and
 they
 just
 do
 one


thing.
 But
 but
 when
 you
 want
 to
 do


policy
 relevant
 research,
 uh
 you
 talk
 to


policy
 makers
 and
 then
 you
 the
 minute


you
 start
 talking
 to
 policy
 makers
 and


spend
 time
 in
 policy
 institutions,
 you


realize
 these
 problems
 don't
 come
 like


that.
 Oh,
 here's
 a
 you
 know
 problem


about
 you
 know
 labor
 so
 I
 need
 labor


economy.
 Here's
 a
 problem
 about
 like
 you


know
 uh
 financial
 market.
 There's
 a
 I


mean
 problem
 about
 mother
 the
 problems


are
 linked
 the
 problems
 are
 linked
 and


economics
 profession
 actually
 is
 uh
 is


capable
 of
 you
 know
 answering
 those


problems
 creating
 solutions
 for
 those


problems
 if
 you
 know
 these
 insights
 from


these
 different
 sub
 fields
 come
 together


uh
 which
 is
 you
 know
 what
 I
 try
 to
 do
 uh


and
 I
 I'm
 hoping
 you
 know
 uh
 which
 kind


of
 you
 know
 academic
 publishing
 you
 know


doesn't
 value
 uh
 that
 much
 but
 I
 I
 am


you
 know
 I'm
 an
 optimist
 I'm
 hopeful
 I


think
 uh
 these
 are
 the
 times
 uh
 people


now
 coming
 together
 writing
 with
 each


other
 more
 and
 you
 know
 realizing
 this


more
 and
 more
 so
 hopefully
 um
 you
 know


we'll
 we'll
 go
 downward
 to
 a
 to
 a
 better


path
 on
 this.
 Yeah.


>> So
 as
 a
 consumer
 so
 if
 everything
 you're


saying
 is
 right
 so
 that's
 awesome.
 I
 I
 I


would
 encourage
 you
 to
 kind
 of
 like


obviously
 you
 want
 to
 come
 in
 and
 give


some
 numbers
 but
 give
 us
 like
 versions


of
 the
 model
 that
 shut
 down
 this
 down.


And
 you're
 telling
 me
 that
 real
 itself


generates
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 are
 not


in
 standard
 models.
 So
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 really


excited
 and
 I'd
 like
 to


>> and
 and
 I
 fully
 agree.
 You
 can
 do
 the


smoothing
 as
 little
 as
 you
 want.
 That's


where
 the
 data
 is
 going
 to
 help
 you.
 You


need
 data
 power,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 put


this
 in
 a
 macro
 model.
 I
 mean
 otherwise


you
 are
 not
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to


inflation
 output
 tradeoff
 and
 all
 these


policy
 questions.
 You
 have
 to
 put
 it
 in%


agree
 with
 that.


>> So
 all
 right,
 I
 will
 I
 will
 step
 in
 in


here.
 We
 have
 a
 iron
 cage
 uh
 in
 there


and
 I
 have
 things
 uh
 we'll
 we'll
 we'll


put
 that
 on
 a
 on
 a
 YouTube.
 I'll
 have


dinner.


[music]


[music]


>> You
 know,
 Joe,
 there
 was
 in
 fact
 one


major
 policy
 maker
 in
 the
 room
 along


with
 everyone
 else
 and
 that
 is
 Susan


Collins.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 there
 are
 actually


there
 are
 two
 prominent
 Susan
 Collins.


This
 one
 is
 the
 president
 of
 the
 Federal


Reserve
 Bank
 of
 Boston
 and
 she
 was
 there


the
 whole
 time
 sitting
 in
 the
 front
 row.


Susan
 herself
 actually
 was
 an
 academic.


She
 taught
 at
 Harvard
 and
 Georgetown
 and


the
 University
 of
 Michigan.


>> Right.
 There
 are
 lots
 of
 themes
 going


on.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 I'm
 struck
 by
 the


the
 sense
 that
 understanding


some
 of
 the
 complexities


may
 change
 traditional
 ways
 of
 thinking


about
 things.
 So
 that's
 a
 theme
 that
 I'm


hearing.
 So
 the
 first
 paper
 was
 really


if
 you
 um
 if
 you
 account
 for
 the


linkages
 through
 networks
 that
 include


not
 only
 trade
 flows
 but
 also
 financial


flows
 and
 you
 know
 if
 you
 and
 across


sectors
 and
 countries
 not
 just
 through


countries
 but
 add
 the
 sector
 component


in.
 we
 may
 historically
 with
 simpler


more
 traditional
 models
 have


underestimated
 the
 potential
 for
 larger


more
 persistent
 effects
 of
 different


kinds
 of
 shocks.
 And
 then
 similarly
 the


second
 paper
 had
 kind
 of
 a
 similar
 theme


that
 when
 you
 really
 um
 focus
 on
 some
 of


the
 supply
 chain
 connections
 increases


in
 uncertainty
 can
 make
 a
 shock
 have
 a


bigger
 impact.
 So
 putting
 the
 different


things
 making
 those
 connections
 that's


complicated
 work.
 I'm
 really
 glad
 that


we
 have
 experts
 who
 are
 digging
 in
 and


able
 to
 explain
 them
 and
 present
 them


for
 us
 and
 have
 us
 ask
 questions
 and
 try


to
 understand
 them
 better.


>> So
 Susan
 mentioned
 ideas
 and
 one
 thing


I'm
 very
 curious
 about
 is
 how
 the
 ideas


being
 presented
 in
 these
 papers
 actually


filter
 through
 into
 policy


>> osmosis.
 Right.


>> Well,
 right.
 I'm
 sure
 I'm
 sure
 there's


some
 of
 that,
 but
 also
 like
 do
 you
 think


Susan
 is
 taking
 the
 most
 interesting


paper
 and
 attaching
 it
 to
 an
 email
 and


sending
 it
 off
 to
 Tom
 Barkin
 at
 the


Richmond
 Fed
 and
 being
 like,
 "You
 have


to
 read
 this."


>> Yeah,
 I
 would.
 Hey,
 Tom,
 here's


something
 you
 might
 find
 interesting.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 there
 lots
 of
 different
 ways.


So,
 sometimes
 um
 you
 know,
 sometimes
 we


have
 the
 time
 to
 go
 to
 each
 other's


conferences
 and
 it's
 hard,
 right,


because
 we
 there's
 a
 lot
 going
 on.
 Uh
 so


sometimes
 people
 uh
 sometimes
 my


colleagues
 will
 actually
 be
 sitting
 in


and
 hear
 it
 from
 themselves.
 Some
 of


their
 uh
 research
 teams
 are
 often
 tuning


in
 whether
 in
 person
 or
 virtually.
 Our


research
 teams
 talk
 to
 each
 other.


They're
 very
 active
 relationships.
 They


co-author
 papers.
 They're
 engaged
 in


that
 way.
 And
 certainly
 if
 they're


things
 that
 are
 really
 informative
 for


me,
 I
 will
 share
 them
 with
 colleagues
 in


a
 variety
 of
 different
 ways.
 Maybe
 not


as
 much
 attach
 the
 paper.
 you
 know,
 we


have
 a
 lot
 to
 read
 and
 to
 to
 go
 through.


I
 would
 try
 to
 distill
 why
 I'm
 really


interested,
 but
 you
 know,
 we're
 always


looking
 for
 important
 ideas,
 trying
 to


be
 better
 informed.
 [music]
 That's


something
 that's
 important
 to
 all
 of
 us.


>> And
 again,
 thank
 you
 for
 joining
 us
 for


the
 69th
 conference.
 We're
 delighted
 to


have
 OddLots
 here.


[music]


So,
 that
 was
 the
 Boston
 Fed's
 research


conference.
 Joe,


>> it
 was
 great.
 But
 before
 we
 go,
 should


tell
 people
 how
 Omar's
 presentation


went.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 So,
 we
 started
 this
 episode


talking
 to
 Boston
 Fed
 economist
 Omar


Barbierro.
 And
 I
 feel
 like
 he
 was
 under


more
 pressure
 than
 most
 because
 he
 was


presenting
 not
 just
 in
 front
 of
 his


peers,
 but
 in
 front
 of
 his
 actual
 boss.


actually
 multiple
 bosses
 because
 there's


Susan
 Collins
 but
 also
 Egon
 Zakryek.
 So


his
 boss
 and
 his
 boss's
 boss.


>> Yeah.
 And
 his
 was
 actually
 the
 last


paper
 of
 the
 conference.
 I
 thought
 it


went
 really
 well.


>> Some
 interesting
 insights
 on
 that.
 Thank


you
 very
 much.
 [applause]


>> Basically
 what
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I
 think


it's
 an
 exciting
 effort.
 Uh
 very


impressive
 data
 collection
 and
 rich
 set


of
 results.


>> Tomaso
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 presentation
 was


very
 interesting.
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


effort
 also
 is
 um
 is
 very
 important
 and


great
 this
 is
 really
 cool
 to
 see
 I
 have


three
 three
 quick


>> uh
 okay
 this
 is
 this
 is
 a
 great
 paper
 uh


and
 I
 fully
 agree
 with
 Andrea
 that
 this


is
 actually
 huge
 work
 so
 you
 didn't
 even


mention
 but
 we
 are
 also
 now
 matching


piva
 to
 a
 larger
 set
 of
 uh
 firms


>> ho
 that's
 a
 good
 outcome
 and
 you
 know
 I


should
 just
 mention
 Joe
 we
 we've


obviously
 been
 summarizing
 all
 these


papers
 because
 we're
 trying
 to
 compress


a
 day
 and
 a
 half
 of
 discussion
 into
 I


don't
 know
 40
 60
 minutes
 but
 all
 of


these
 papers
 are
 available
 online
 at
 the


Boston
 Fed's
 website


>> totally
 and
 if
 you
 want
 to
 actually
 see


the
 conference
 itself
 if
 this
 episode
 if


if
 somehow
 this
 episode
 was
 not
 enough


for
 you
 um
 actually
 the
 entire


conference
 is
 on
 video
 so
 you
 could
 see


all
 of
 the
 presentations
 and
 the


discussants
 and
 so
 forth
 it's
 all


available
 online


>> but
 I'm
 so
 glad
 we
 went
 because
 I
 feel


like
 I
 have
 a
 much
 better
 understanding


ing
 of
 how
 policy
 actually
 develops,
 how


research
 develops
 and
 what
 economists


are
 kind
 of
 aiming
 for.


>> Totally.
 So
 when
 we
 went
 to
 Boston,
 you


know,
 in
 my
 mind
 I
 was
 thinking
 like
 we


were
 there
 to
 learn
 more
 about
 economics


which
 of
 course
 we
 did
 and
 there
 were


all
 kinds
 of
 interesting
 ideas
 on
 supply


chains,
 inflation,
 all
 the
 stuff
 we


talked
 about.
 But
 it
 was
 also
 and
 I


hadn't
 appreciated
 this.
 It
 was
 a


sociology
 trip
 like
 we're
 learning
 about


the
 sociology
 of
 how
 academic
 work
 works


the
 relationship
 between
 academic
 work


and
 policy
 and
 stuff
 which
 is
 just
 one


of
 these
 things
 that
 of
 course


intuitively
 is
 very
 important
 but
 I


don't
 think
 like
 anyone
 really
 thinks


about
 and
 when
 you
 think
 about
 like
 how


economists
 could
 be
 under
 this
 sort
 of


dual
 pressure
 of
 like
 do
 I
 want
 to


influence
 policy
 and
 is
 there
 some
 cost


if
 I'm
 focusing
 on
 maximizing
 total


published
 output
 you
 could
 see
 some
 real


uh
 interesting
 tensions
 that
 emerge
 in


that
 process,


>> right?
 It's
 sort
 of
 a
 microcosm
 of


academia,
 I
 guess,
 which
 we
 got
 to
 study


for
 a
 day
 and
 a
 half.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.


Maybe
 maybe
 next
 year
 we'll
 be
 in
 the


room
 at
 Jackson
 Hole.
 We
 can
 hope


>> if
 anyone
 at
 the
 Kansas
 City
 Fed


[laughter]
 is
 listening.


>> All
 right.
 Uh,
 shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.
