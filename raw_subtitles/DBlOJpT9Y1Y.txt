Marty
 McCary,
 commissioner
 of
 the
 FDA.


Welcome
 to
 San
 Francisco.


>> Great
 to
 be
 here,
 Dave.
 Good
 to
 be
 with


you.


>> Yeah,
 thanks.
 It's
 JP
 Morgan
 Healthcare


Conference
 this
 week
 in
 San
 Francisco.


Considered,
 I
 think,
 probably
 the


biggest
 most
 important
 biotech


conference
 globally.
 Very
 important


week.
 So,
 you're
 visiting
 this
 week
 for


the
 conference.


>> Yeah.
 120,000
 people,
 great


conversations.
 You
 hear
 from
 everybody.


Just
 not
 enough
 time
 to
 meet
 with


everybody
 you
 want
 to
 meet
 with,
 but


it's
 a
 great
 time.


>> Well,
 thanks
 for
 sitting
 down
 with
 me.


You
 and
 I
 have
 gotten
 to
 know
 each
 other


a
 little
 bit
 over
 the
 last
 year
 or
 so


>> and
 I'm
 really
 excited
 uh
 to
 hear
 a


little
 bit
 about
 how
 things
 are
 going.


It's
 been
 almost
 a
 year
 since
 you've


been
 in
 the
 role.
 I
 think
 maybe
 for
 our


audience
 you
 could
 share
 a
 little
 bit


about
 how
 you
 got
 this
 role.
 How
 did
 you


get
 involved
 with
 this
 administration?


How
 did
 you
 get
 connected
 with
 them?
 And


maybe
 we
 can
 go
 all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 your


very
 outspoken
 views
 uh
 during
 the
 COVID


pandemic
 and
 maybe
 how
 that
 brought


attention
 to
 you
 and
 your
 philosophies


that
 that
 drove
 this
 role.


>> Yeah.
 So
 my
 um
 interest
 in
 academia,
 I


um
 went
 to
 graduate
 school
 for
 public


health
 and
 served
 on
 the
 faculty
 of
 the


Johns
 Hopkins
 School
 of
 Public
 Health
 as


I
 also
 had
 a
 clinical
 practice
 in
 GI
 and


cancer
 surgery
 at
 Johns
 Hopkins.
 And
 my


interest
 was
 always
 in
 the
 root
 causes


of
 our
 healthcare
 system
 problems
 from


quality,
 transparency,
 and
 price.
 And
 in


the
 work
 on
 price,
 uh,
 I
 led
 sort
 of
 a


national
 effort
 to
 try
 to
 get
 more
 price


transparency
 of
 hospital
 prices.
 I
 wrote


a
 book
 on
 it
 that
 did
 very
 well.
 It
 took


me
 to
 the
 White
 House
 where
 they
 had


read
 the
 book,
 invited
 me
 in,
 and
 in


that
 first
 Trump
 administration,
 we
 had


a
 lot
 of
 great
 conversations
 and
 then


they
 implemented
 the
 idea
 and
 I
 was
 so


impressed.
 This
 makes
 sense.
 You
 know,


we
 want
 common
 sense
 ideas.
 And
 so
 we


got
 the
 hospital
 price
 transparency


executive
 order
 signed
 by
 the
 president.


That's
 where
 I
 developed
 some
 of
 the


relationships
 and
 got
 to
 know
 the
 folks.


And
 then
 when
 uh
 President
 Trump
 got


reelected,
 he
 gave
 me
 a
 call
 days
 after


the
 election
 and
 I
 was
 very
 honored
 to


be
 offered
 this
 role.
 So,
 it's
 been


awesome.
 Uh
 co,
 you
 mentioned
 CO,
 it
 was


a
 crazy
 time.
 I
 mean,
 the
 sort
 of


sociology
 of
 medical
 dogma
 is
 a


fascinating
 historical
 thing
 and
 we


still
 suffer
 from
 it.
 paternalism,
 the


sort
 of
 suppressing
 ideas
 that
 are
 not


the
 legacy
 ideas,
 the
 sort
 of


sacrificing
 the
 basic
 principles
 of


science
 to
 question
 everything
 to
 have


no
 sacred
 cows.
 And
 you
 saw
 the
 worst
 of


that
 bad
 behavior
 during
 co
 cloth
 masks


on
 toddlers
 for
 3
 years,


vaccine
 mandates
 for
 young
 college


students,
 recommending
 COVID
 boosters


with
 such
 absolutism
 and
 young
 healthy


children.
 you
 the
 um
 ignoring
 natural


immunity.
 One
 of
 the
 most
 uh


scientifically
 dishonest
 things
 a


scientist
 could
 possibly
 say
 about
 the


with
 the
 virus
 and
 the
 and
 the
 immunity


and
 um
 shutting
 kids
 out
 of
 school
 for


nearly
 two
 years
 which
 I
 fought
 tooth


and
 nail
 along
 with
 Jay
 Bachari
 and


others
 starting
 in
 the
 fall
 of
 2020.
 We


initially
 we
 were
 okay
 just
 doing
 stuff


while
 we
 didn't
 understand
 it
 but
 once


the
 data
 emerged
 we
 made
 a
 strong
 case


to
 reopen
 the
 schools
 and
 to
 some
 degree


I
 feel
 like
 we
 lost
 that
 battle
 but


people
 now
 see
 that
 the
 data
 has
 caught


up
 with
 public
 health
 officials
 and
 so


I'm
 proud
 to
 be
 in
 office
 now
 to
 be
 a


part
 of
 an
 effort
 to
 rebuild
 public


trust
 in
 our
 health
 institutions
 and
 you


must
 be
 having
 a
 lot
 of
 conflict
 then


because
 you
 really
 are
 fundamentally


trying
 to
 rewrite
 the
 way
 these


institutions
 operate
 have
 operated
 and


in
 some
 sense
 you
 are
 degrading
 the


success
 and
 the
 career
 and
 the
 authority


that
 some
 have
 vested
 themselves
 over


time
 in
 those
 roles.
 How
 has
 that
 been


and
 and
 what's
 the
 push
 back
 been
 like


as
 you've
 kind
 of
 gone
 through
 this


exercise?


>> So
 I
 meet
 with
 folks
 at
 the
 FDA
 and
 if


you
 meet
 with
 them
 with
 their
 bosses
 and


everybody
 in
 the
 room
 to
 get
 a
 briefing


on
 a
 topic
 then
 they
 give
 you
 one


glowing
 story.
 But
 if
 you
 meet
 with
 one


individual
 scientific
 reviewer
 and
 give


them
 the
 safety
 of
 anonymity
 and
 say


look
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 how
 is
 it
 going
 on


the
 ground
 or
 what
 big
 ideas
 do
 you
 have


that
 you've
 always
 wanted
 to
 do
 but
 not


been
 able
 to
 do
 four
 out
 of
 five
 people


or
 sometimes
 more
 will
 will
 not
 not


really
 give
 you
 anything
 interesting
 but


then
 somebody
 will
 say
 you
 know
 it
 makes


no
 sense
 that
 we
 do
 it
 this
 way
 and
 we


could
 do
 it
 better
 and
 we
 could
 do
 it


this
 way
 something
 they
 they
 wouldn't


feel
 comfortable
 offering
 if
 their


supervisor
 were
 in
 the
 room.
 And
 so


we've
 been
 running
 with
 these
 ideas.
 We


have
 announced
 42
 major
 reforms
 in
 my
 10


months
 in
 office
 at
 the
 FDA


and
 it
 it
 has
 challenged
 the
 status
 quo


of
 doing
 things.
 But
 we
 have
 to
 I
 mean


it
 why
 does
 it
 take
 10
 to
 12
 years
 for
 a


new
 drug
 to
 come
 to
 market?
 We've
 become


so
 lukewarm
 and
 passive
 accepting
 that


horrible
 uh
 timeline
 that
 that
 has
 just


become
 the
 status
 quo.
 We've
 got
 to


challenge
 these
 deeply
 held
 assumptions.


And
 we're
 doing
 it.
 We
 are
 doing
 it
 with


new
 programs,
 new
 priority
 reviews,
 new


pilots,
 new
 forms
 of
 transparency.
 We


made
 our
 our
 rejection
 letters
 public
 so


that
 if
 the
 FDA
 does
 not
 approve
 a
 drug,


the
 public
 deserves
 to
 know
 why.
 And
 it


creates
 accountability.


>> And
 that
 was
 not
 the
 case
 before.
 They


talked
 about
 it
 for
 30
 years
 and
 we
 got


it
 done.
 They
 talked
 about
 banning
 one


food
 diet
 for
 35
 years.
 Within
 weeks
 of


coming
 into
 office,
 we
 took
 action
 to


remove
 all
 nine
 artificial
 petroleum


based
 diet.
 So,
 we're
 getting
 stuff


done.
 We're
 not
 afraid
 to
 move
 fast.
 And


in
 that
 role,
 some
 people
 have
 left


the
 FDA
 and
 then
 they've
 been
 outspoken


critics
 of
 yourself.
 Maybe
 you
 can


respond
 to
 some
 of
 the
 criticisms
 that


it's
 chaotic,
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


turmoil.
 I've
 worked
 at
 many
 startups.
 I


know
 that
 when
 you
 move
 fast,
 things


feel
 or
 they
 may
 feel
 too
 busy
 or
 they


may
 feel
 like
 there's
 too
 much
 going
 on.


It's
 overwhelming
 at
 times,
 but
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 progress
 is
 what


matters.
 Maybe
 you
 could
 just
 comment
 on


some
 of
 the
 reports
 made
 by
 employees


that
 have
 quit
 the
 FDA,
 left
 and
 and
 and


provided
 some
 comments
 on
 how
 things
 are


going.


>> There
 were
 2,000
 HR
 people
 at
 the
 FDA


just
 before
 I
 got
 there.
 There
 were


1,500


IT
 people.


And
 so,
 for
 a
 staff
 of
 how
 many
 total?


>> 20,000
 employees
 just
 before
 I
 got


there.
 And
 so
 there
 was
 a
 goal
 to
 say,


hey,
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 back
 to
 2019


staffing
 levels
 and
 the
 cuts
 are
 not


going
 to
 be
 to
 scientists
 or
 reviewers.


No
 scientific
 reviewer
 was
 laid
 off.
 But


there
 were
 significant
 consolidations
 in


HR,
 procurement,
 IT,
 and
 the
 duplicative


services
 that
 were
 out
 there.
 Now,


anytime
 you
 do
 something
 in
 government,


you
 you
 take
 headline
 risk,
 but
 we
 felt


it
 was
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do.
 And
 so
 I


came
 in
 right
 after
 that
 uh
 massive
 sort


of
 change.
 And
 since
 then
 we've
 had
 a


great
 culture.
 We've
 had
 more
 teamwork.


We
 have
 new
 leaders.
 And
 they
 believe
 in


this
 new
 vision.
 The
 number
 one
 priority


of
 the
 commissioner
 that
 preceded
 me,
 he


said,
 was
 to
 fight
 misinformation.


>> Well,
 my
 number
 one
 priority
 is
 not
 to


censor
 Americans.
 It's
 to
 deliver
 more


cures
 and
 meaningful
 treatments
 faster


to
 the
 American
 public
 and
 healthier


food
 for
 children.
 And
 I
 think
 every


employee
 at
 the
 FDA
 knows
 that
 mission.


We
 have
 incredible
 teamwork.
 Um
 our


turnover
 rate
 is
 at
 the
 baseline
 5
 to
 7%


that
 has
 been
 there
 for
 the
 last
 10


years
 at
 the
 agency.
 So
 there's
 no


exodus,
 there's
 no
 mass
 uh
 departures.


We
 are
 actually
 hiring
 1,50
 new


scientists
 because
 we
 have
 very


ambitious
 goals
 on
 our
 new
 pathways.


accelerated
 type
 pathways.
 And
 so
 we're


um
 building
 up
 capacity
 to
 have
 a
 whole


new
 line
 of
 pathways
 so
 that
 we
 can


deliver
 faster
 for
 the
 American
 people.


>> Great.
 Well,
 look,
 let's
 start
 with
 a


framing.
 The
 framing
 is
 the
 US
 verse


China.
 I
 want
 to
 read
 this
 report
 that


came
 from
 the
 Congressional
 National


Security
 Commission
 on
 Emerging


Biotechnology.
 We're
 here
 at
 a
 at
 a


biotech
 conference.
 So,
 I
 figured
 we


could
 start
 here
 because
 everyone's


talking
 about
 China
 and
 the
 race
 against


China.
 The
 US,
 according
 to
 this


commission,
 has
 a
 three-year
 window
 to


act
 to
 keep
 up
 with
 Chinese
 innovation


and
 the
 speed
 in
 biotech.


In
 2022,
 Chinese
 companies
 were
 just
 5%


of
 licensing
 deals.
 2025,
 42%.


And
 recently,
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


licensing
 deals
 ever
 was
 3S
 Bio
 1.25


billion
 up
 front
 with
 a
 $6
 billion
 total


with
 Fizer.
 China
 had
 10
 years
 ago
 only


50%
 of
 published
 scientific
 papers
 to


the
 US.
 Today
 they're
 50%
 more
 than
 the


US.
 So
 I
 just
 want
 to
 walk
 through
 your


view
 on
 US
 biioarma


innovation
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 China.
 Is


there
 a
 race
 and
 if
 so
 what
 are
 the


priorities
 for
 the
 administration
 in


helping
 American
 biotech
 industry
 remain


competitive?


>> There
 is
 a
 race
 and
 when
 we
 came
 to


office
 we
 were
 losing
 that
 race.
 We
 were


behind.
 we
 were
 getting
 clocked
 by


China,
 by
 Australia
 and
 other
 countries


that
 were
 doing
 things
 more
 efficiently


with
 less
 red
 tape
 and
 um
 we
 made
 it
 a


massive
 priority
 to
 say
 we
 need
 to
 uh


retain
 our
 number
 one
 position
 in
 life


sciences
 and
 biomedical
 research
 and


we've
 got
 to
 think
 innovatively
 so
 we


can
 come
 up
 with
 some
 protectionist


strategies
 but
 ultimately
 what
 we
 need


to
 do
 is
 be
 more
 competitive
 with
 what's


going
 on
 with
 phase
 1's
 and
 INDs


overseas.


So
 that
 means
 we
 need
 to
 rethink
 our


entire
 phase
 one
 uh
 process.
 We
 have
 to


convene
 hospitals
 uh
 who
 are
 um
 so
 part


of
 the
 problem
 is
 outside
 of
 the
 walls


of
 the
 FDA.
 When
 hospitals
 have
 IRBs,


that
 is
 the
 institutional
 review
 review


boards
 that
 approve
 research
 that
 meet


monthly
 and
 you
 know
 at
 at
 Johns
 Hopkins


I
 had
 a
 study
 took
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 to


go
 through
 the
 IRB.
 It
 was
 a
 survey.


What
 are
 we
 worried
 about?
 It
 was
 a


survey.
 It
 was
 a
 nutrition
 survey
 and
 at


the
 end
 of
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 it
 was
 not


approved.


That
 kind
 of
 stuff
 is
 intolerable
 when


we're
 competing
 with
 uh
 China
 where


they're
 doing
 phase
 ones
 in
 4
 weeks
 with


uh
 Australia
 that's
 doing
 phase
 ones
 in


6
 weeks.
 And
 so
 we
 need
 to
 uh
 have
 more


centralized
 IRBs
 and
 we
 need
 to


streamline
 the
 hospital
 contracting


because
 right
 now
 if
 you
 want
 to
 do
 a


trial
 each
 hospital
 wants
 to
 negotiate


their
 margin
 of
 what
 they
 want
 and
 and


sure
 they
 have
 to
 customize
 the
 contract


because
 every
 study
 is
 different
 has


different
 requirements
 and
 resources


that
 are
 needed.
 But
 you
 go
 to
 Australia


and
 they
 say
 sure
 sign
 here
 on
 the


dotted
 line
 you
 have
 access
 to
 these
 14


hospitals
 or
 so.
 And
 so
 we
 have
 got
 to


have
 more
 centralized
 contracting
 and
 a


centralized
 IRB
 in
 order
 to
 compete.


Those
 are
 big
 priorities.
 And
 we
 also


have
 to
 reduce
 the
 red
 tape
 and


regulation
 on
 our
 own
 IND's
 phase
 ones.


And
 the
 entire
 process,
 you
 know,
 when


we
 came
 in,
 it
 took
 60
 days
 for
 the
 FDA


just
 to
 tell
 you
 whether
 or
 not
 they


were
 going
 to
 consider
 a
 supplemental


application.
 I
 mean,
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff


is
 intolerable
 in
 the
 modern
 world.
 It


took
 and
 you
 know
 some
 often
 still
 takes


60
 days
 just
 for
 the
 FDA
 to
 tell
 you


that
 your
 application
 is
 complete.
 We're


going
 to
 get
 that
 down
 to
 one
 day.
 We're


going
 to
 use
 AI.
 So
 we've
 got
 to


modernize
 the
 agency
 and
 be
 more


competitive,
 not
 just
 talk
 about


protectionist
 strategies.
 As
 you
 think


about
 those
 work
 streams
 in
 improving


the
 efficiency,
 turnaround
 time,
 how


much
 can
 you
 do
 this
 on
 your
 own
 versus


how
 much
 do
 you
 need
 Congress
 to
 act
 to


pass
 legislation
 to
 support
 those


changes?
 And
 are
 there
 priorities
 that


you're
 working
 with
 Congress
 on
 to
 try


and
 accelerate
 drug
 approval
 timelines


that
 are
 necessary?


>> So,
 right
 now
 we
 have
 user
 fees,
 which


means
 if
 you
 submit
 an
 application,


there's
 a
 fee
 associated
 with
 it
 because


there's
 an
 unknown
 number
 of


applications
 each
 year.
 So,
 it
 it's
 a


system
 that's
 been
 around
 for
 a
 while.


And
 so,
 uh,
 I'd
 like
 to
 see
 those
 user


fees
 much
 higher
 if
 your
 phase
 one
 is


done
 overseas.
 And
 if
 it's
 done
 in
 the


United
 States,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lower


user
 fee.
 That's
 what
 I'd
 like
 to
 see.


It's
 an
 America
 first
 policy.
 I'd
 love


Congress
 to
 do
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff,
 but


we're
 not
 going
 to
 wait
 for
 them.


Congress
 is
 slow.
 We're
 moving


incredibly
 fast.
 You
 know,
 our
 number


one
 goal
 was
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the


morale
 was
 good,
 the
 culture
 is
 good,


and
 the
 and
 the
 trains
 are
 running
 on


time,
 coming
 in
 right
 after
 the


restructuring.
 I'm
 proud
 to
 report
 this


year
 in
 2025,
 this
 past
 year,
 we
 hit


100%
 of
 our
 user
 feed
 target
 dates,
 that


is
 the
 trains
 were
 all
 running
 on
 time,


that
 every
 accept
 or
 reject
 decision
 by


the
 FDA,
 was
 consistent
 with
 the
 accept


or
 reject
 decision
 by
 the
 primary
 review


team.
 That
 is,
 we're
 not
 doing
 secret


deals.
 We're
 not
 messing
 with
 things.
 We


are
 standing
 by
 our
 scientists.
 And
 last


month
 we
 had
 a
 record
 number
 of
 drugs


approved
 by
 our
 center
 for
 biologic
 cell


and
 gene
 therapies
 and
 other
 nine
 drugs.


And
 so
 we
 want
 to
 keep
 going
 hard
 and


strong
 and
 innovate.
 But
 the
 first
 goal


in
 the
 first
 nine
 months
 was
 to
 make


sure
 the
 trains
 are
 running
 on
 time
 and


that
 we
 are
 strong.
 And
 I'm
 happy
 to


report
 the
 FDA
 is
 strong
 and
 is
 going
 to


continue
 to
 be
 strong.
 And
 going
 back
 to


this
 point
 about
 cutting
 down
 on


timelines
 for
 phase
 1
 2
 3
 maybe
 you
 can


just
 for
 the
 audience
 that
 may
 not
 work


in
 this
 industry
 very
 briefly
 explain


phase
 1
 2
 3


>> and
 then
 where
 we
 think
 there's
 the


biggest
 kind
 of
 uh
 call
 it
 excess


regulatory
 burden
 that's
 causing
 these


extended
 timelines
 on
 drug
 approvals


just
 just
 to
 kind
 of
 frame
 it
 up
 a


little
 bit.


>> Sure.
 So
 there's
 an
 something
 called
 the


IND
 investigational
 new
 drug


registration
 process.
 That's
 step
 one.


Most
 of
 those
 are
 actually
 filed
 by


academics
 and
 I
 think
 people
 forget
 that


we
 still
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 great
 innovation


in
 our
 academic
 spaces.
 It's
 not
 just


the
 pharma
 labs.
 Uh
 then
 you
 uh
 try
 a


drug
 in
 healthy
 subjects.
 That's
 called


a
 phase
 one
 trial.
 Typically
 a
 small


number,
 a
 handful.
 And
 then
 you
 give
 the


drug
 to
 subjects
 with
 the
 condition
 and


that's
 a
 phase
 two.
 It's
 a
 limited


study.
 And
 then
 phase
 three
 is
 a
 large


randomized
 control
 trial.
 We
 call
 it
 the


pivotal
 trial.
 We
 announced
 just
 last


month
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 go
 from
 a


baseline
 default
 requirement
 of
 two


pivotal
 trials
 for
 a
 drug
 to
 one
 pivotal


trial
 for
 a
 drug.
 It's
 just
 math.
 You


can
 achieve
 the
 same
 statistical
 power


if
 you
 design
 one
 good
 clinical
 trial


properly
 with
 a
 good
 control
 group.
 Uh


and
 so
 that
 by
 the
 way
 that
 saves
 like
 a


hundred
 million
 to
 $300
 million
 for
 some


companies.
 Shortens
 the
 time.
 We're


reducing
 animal
 testing.
 That's
 the


preend
 or
 prephase
 one
 work.
 that
 is
 how


does
 it
 work
 in
 animals?
 We
 are


eliminating
 a
 lot
 of
 animal
 testing


requirements.
 We
 have
 a
 roadmap.
 You
 no


longer
 officially
 have
 to
 submit


chimpanzeee
 studies
 for
 monoconal


antibodies.
 That
 was
 announced
 two


months
 ago.
 We
 said
 um
 so
 typically
 144


chimpanzees
 are
 used
 for
 a
 monoconal


antibbody.
 By
 the
 way,
 it's
 it's


>> you're
 making
 me
 sick
 because
 this
 has


always
 been
 from
 my
 point
 of
 view
 one
 of


the
 most
 troubling
 bioethical
 concerns


I've
 had
 about
 the
 the
 industry
 because


you
 don't
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 statistical
 power


or
 benefit
 from
 doing
 this
 and
 it's
 just


awful
 that
 we
 do
 it.
 But


>> you
 you
 actually
 get
 misleading


information
 sometimes.
 Some
 say
 aspirin


would
 not
 have
 been
 approved
 today
 if
 we


had
 the
 old
 animal
 testing
 requirements


to
 species
 because
 drugs
 that
 are
 uh


have
 safety
 concerns
 in
 animals
 may
 not


have
 safety
 concerns
 in
 humans.
 So
 we


may
 miss
 out
 on
 cures
 and
 vice
 versa.


90%
 of
 drugs
 that
 pass
 animal
 studies
 do


not
 pass
 safety
 and
 efficacy
 in
 humans.


So
 what
 are
 we
 doing?
 We
 have


computational
 modeling
 now.
 Computer
 can


look
 at
 a
 drug
 and
 actually
 make
 better


predict
 predictions
 and
 we
 have


something
 called
 organ
 on
 a
 chip


technology
 where
 you
 grow
 say
 the
 liver


cells
 or
 heart
 cells
 in
 a
 lab
 administer


the
 drug
 and
 then
 look
 for
 any
 enzyme


leaks
 or
 disturbances.
 These
 are
 modern


techniques.
 We've
 got
 to
 modernize
 the


agency.
 It's
 a
 massive
 goal.
 So


>> and
 they're
 doing
 it
 in
 China.
 They're


doing
 it
 in
 China.
 And


>> if
 we
 don't,
 then
 we're
 also
 putting
 our


industry
 at
 risk.


>> We've
 got
 to
 be
 more
 competitive,
 100%.


And
 so
 what
 does
 this
 do?
 It
 compresses


the
 time
 for
 approval.
 It
 allows


R&D
 to
 be
 done
 at
 a
 lower
 price
 point,


translating
 into
 lower
 drug
 prices
 for


everyday
 Americans.
 More
 drugs
 can
 be


evaluated.
 I
 mean,
 I
 had
 one
 pharma


executive
 tell
 me,
 "Hey,
 I
 love
 you're


going
 from
 2
 to
 one
 pivotal
 trials.
 That


means
 we
 can
 run
 twice
 as
 many
 drugs


through
 large
 pivotal
 trials."
 That's


what
 we
 want.
 We
 want
 to
 see
 more.
 Look,


I'm
 coming
 in
 with
 a
 bi.
 We
 all
 have
 our


biases.
 I
 have
 a
 bias
 and
 it's
 just
 a


matter
 of
 recognizing
 your
 biases
 when


we
 talk
 about
 reforms.
 My
 bias
 is
 being


at
 the
 bedside
 breaking
 bad
 news
 to


people
 with
 incurable
 conditions
 or


being
 at
 the
 bedside
 in
 the
 ICU.
 And


when
 you
 do
 that,
 it
 has
 a
 profound


impact
 on
 your
 brain
 and
 your
 soul.
 and


you
 think
 about
 what
 can
 we
 possibly
 do


to
 give
 this
 individual
 some
 hope.
 And


so
 when
 I
 see
 a
 10
 to
 12
 year
 time


period
 of
 bringing
 a
 drug
 to
 market,
 I


think
 in
 the
 modern
 world
 it
 makes
 no


sense.
 Just
 think
 about
 the
 advances
 in


science
 and
 technology.
 So
 I'm
 committed


to
 that
 mission.
 And
 we've
 got
 a
 new


pilot
 program
 now
 to
 get
 decisions
 out


in
 weeks.


>> It's
 unheard
 of.
 It's
 unprecedented.
 Uh


we
 have
 the
 first
 uh
 medication
 we
 just


announced
 after
 55
 days.
 Um
 we
 we
 have
 a


lot
 to
 change
 in
 the
 workflow
 to
 get


that
 time
 frame
 down.
 But
 we
 have
 I


think
 18
 products
 that
 have
 vouchers
 for


this
 new
 pilot
 program.
 If
 you're
 going


to
 do
 something
 new,
 you
 have
 to
 pick


criteria.


>> You
 can
 either
 do
 it
 randomly
 or
 you
 can


pick
 criteria.
 So
 the
 criteria
 we
 chose


are
 drugs
 in
 line
 with
 our
 national


priorities.
 a
 unmet
 public
 health
 need.


Say
 a
 a
 new
 amazing
 cure
 for
 cancer


where
 the
 tumor
 shrinks
 in
 front
 of
 your


eyes
 and
 you
 don't
 need
 surgery
 or


chemo.
 That's
 a
 real
 thing.
 That's
 I'm


actually
 giving
 you
 a
 real
 example.
 We


gave
 those
 companies
 a
 voucher.
 Um
 if


you're
 bringing
 manufacturing
 back
 to


the
 United
 States,
 that's
 a
 national


security
 issue.
 And
 if
 you
 are
 going
 to


make
 the
 drug
 affordable,
 that's
 an


access
 issue.
 And
 that's
 an
 a
 massive


priority
 for
 this
 president
 is
 lowering


drug
 prices.
 So,
 we
 have
 uh
 this
 pilot


underway
 and
 it's
 going
 extremely
 well.


>> So,
 the
 drug
 company
 gets
 a
 voucher
 if


they
 qualify
 under
 one
 of
 those
 three


criteria
 and
 that
 gives
 them
 a
 fast


track.


>> That's
 right.


>> Yeah.
 And
 when
 will
 we
 get
 a
 readout
 on


how
 that
 program's
 going
 and
 whether
 it


becomes
 standard?


>> So,
 in
 internally
 it's
 going
 great.
 I


mean,
 I've
 got
 employees
 at
 the
 FDA
 tell


me,
 gosh,
 I
 love
 this.
 It
 makes
 sense.


And
 the
 reason
 we
 haven't
 done
 it
 before


is
 that
 we
 farm
 out
 the
 application
 to
 a


dozen
 offices
 and
 everybody
 has
 until


the
 target
 date
 to
 get
 their
 final


reports
 in.
 Well,
 the
 target
 date
 is


about
 a
 year.


>> So
 if
 you
 are
 a
 expeditious
 scientist
 or


you
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 uh
 go
 do
 your


work
 expeditiously
 and
 in
 two
 weeks
 you


have
 your
 result.
 Well,
 it
 doesn't


matter
 because
 the
 farm
 talks
 person
 or


whoever
 else
 is
 another
 part
 of
 that
 has


until
 the
 day
 before.
 Guess
 when
 they're


going
 to
 submit
 it?
 The
 day
 before.
 So,


we
 are
 changing
 the
 incentives


internally,
 the
 bonus
 structure.
 We're


changing
 the
 alignment.
 We're
 changing


the
 culture.
 And
 our
 goal
 is
 to


streamline
 that
 process.


>> Going
 back
 to
 the
 computational
 point,


we
 are
 collecting
 more
 data,
 digitizing


that
 data
 on
 patients
 than
 ever
 before.


That
 data
 should
 generally
 be


accessible.
 Is
 there
 a
 world
 where
 we


can
 transition
 from
 phase
 one,
 phase


two,
 phase
 three
 trials
 into
 a
 phase


one,
 phase
 two
 slash3
 by
 taking
 into


account
 all
 of
 this
 additional
 data?


Some
 people
 have
 talked
 about
 the
 idea


of
 using
 AI
 plus
 other
 health
 data


that's
 collected
 and
 allowing
 the
 phase


3
 to
 kind
 of
 roll
 into
 phase
 2
 and


create
 a
 much
 more
 expedited


computationally
 assisted
 approval


process.
 Is
 that
 something
 that's
 on
 the


road
 map
 or
 is
 discussed?


>> Absolutely.
 There
 has
 been
 tinkering
 of


combining
 phase
 one
 and
 two,
 phase
 one,


two
 hybrid
 trials,
 phase
 two
 and
 three


hybrid
 trials,
 approving
 something
 with


sort
 of
 a
 preliminary
 approval
 after


phase
 two
 if
 the
 results
 are
 really


promising.
 And
 those
 are
 all
 steps
 in


the
 right
 direction,
 but
 I
 think
 of


something
 much
 bigger.
 Can
 we
 move
 to


continuous
 trials?
 Can
 we
 use
 basian
 uh


statistical
 evaluation
 which
 we


announced
 this
 week?
 We
 are
 now
 going
 to


allow
 basian
 statistics
 to
 be
 used.
 So


now
 you
 can
 if
 something
 works
 instead


of
 having
 a
 committee
 meet
 twice
 a
 year


to
 do
 a
 cut
 of
 the
 data
 and
 print
 it
 out


and
 everybody
 looks
 at
 it.
 I
 mean
 I
 was


literally
 on
 those
 committees.


Why
 can't
 we
 in
 real
 time
 with
 AI
 tools


figure
 out
 when
 there's
 a
 safety
 signal


or
 efficacy
 established
 and
 then
 call
 it


at
 that
 point
 allowing
 more
 people
 to


get
 the
 drug
 as
 soon
 as
 we
 know
 it


works.
 And
 is
 there
 more
 continuous


tracking
 that's
 also
 possible
 to
 look


for
 risks
 and
 issues
 that
 start
 to


emerge
 in
 certain
 populations?
 Because


this
 is
 something
 that
 it's
 almost
 like


the
 approval
 happens
 and
 then
 you
 find


out
 years
 later
 that
 well
 maybe
 there


was
 an
 issue
 that
 we
 should
 have
 caught


sooner.
 And
 if
 you
 move
 to
 a
 more


datadriven
 continuous
 observational


system,
 can
 you
 both
 have
 faster


approvals
 but
 also
 faster
 recognition
 of


safety
 concerns
 for
 specific
 population?


>> Yeah,
 I
 love
 the
 way
 you're
 thinking.
 So


we
 I
 want
 to
 see
 continuous
 trials
 with


endpoints
 in
 the
 cloud


>> so
 that
 the
 reviewers
 are
 looking
 on
 to


the
 endpoint.
 You
 don't
 do
 your
 freshman


year
 of
 college
 and
 then
 submit
 a
 giant


50,000page
 application
 to
 start
 your


sophomore
 year
 and
 then
 do
 your


sophomore
 year
 and
 start
 another
 50
 page


to
 start
 your
 but
 that's
 what
 we're


doing
 at
 the
 FDA.
 Now
 look,
 it
 had
 good


intentions,
 but
 we
 live
 in
 a
 modern


world.
 We're
 using
 computers
 now,
 not


stone
 tablets.
 And
 so
 we
 can
 run
 more


continuous
 trials.
 That's
 the
 goal.
 And


we
 can
 use
 basian
 statistics,
 which
 we


announced
 this
 week
 a
 a
 a
 big
 uh
 uh
 sort


of
 new
 milestone
 with
 that.
 And
 I
 want


to
 see
 um
 I
 want
 to
 see
 us
 continue
 to


have
 eyes
 on
 a
 drug
 after
 approval.
 So


approval
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 a
 point
 where
 we


say
 hey
 the
 world
 can
 use
 it
 with
 a
 fair


degree
 of
 confidence
 on
 the
 safety
 uh


efficac
 and
 efficacy
 tradeoff
 but


uh
 why
 did
 we
 learn
 5
 years
 after
 Vio


was
 approved
 that
 it
 may
 have
 killed


38,000
 people
 well
 in
 the
 modern
 world


with
 big
 data
 we
 can
 have
 eyes
 on
 a
 drug


as
 it's
 being
 used
 in
 real
 time
 to
 call


out
 that
 safety
 signal.
 immediately
 and


let
 people
 know.
 It
 may
 be
 a
 subgroup
 of


people
 that
 are
 affected.
 There
 may
 be
 a


drug
 drug
 interaction.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 you


think
 about
 the
 opioid
 epidemic,
 15


years
 of
 prescribing
 it,
 having
 no
 idea.


And
 I
 was
 I'm
 guilty.
 I
 was
 doing
 this.


I
 was
 prescribing
 it.
 My
 patients
 were


getting
 addicted,
 coming
 back
 for


refills.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 a


one-off
 thing.
 You
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


come
 back,
 ask
 for
 refills.
 No,
 it
 was
 a


national
 pattern
 we
 should
 have


identified
 in
 big
 data.
 And
 so
 we're


going
 to
 do
 postmarket
 surveillance
 in
 a


way
 like
 we've
 never
 seen
 before
 using


big
 data.
 And
 if
 we
 get
 it
 right,
 if
 we


get
 it
 right
 and
 there's
 a
 big
 priority,


it
 can
 actually
 change
 the
 threshold
 of


approval
 because
 you
 know
 you're
 going


to
 have
 eyes
 on
 a
 drug
 immediately
 for


people
 in
 the
 general
 audience
 to


understand
 this
 begs
 the
 question
 and
 I


think
 people
 will
 bring
 this
 up
 as
 as
 a


critique
 of
 absolute
 safety.
 I
 always


talk
 about
 the
 example
 of
 you
 put
 the


Whimos
 or
 the
 autonomous
 cars
 on
 the


road,
 they
 uh
 cut
 down
 on
 uh
 fatalities


by
 95%.
 But
 as
 soon
 as
 one
 person
 gets


killed
 by
 a
 Whimo,
 the
 media
 goes
 crazy


and
 says
 these
 autonomous
 cars
 are


killing
 people.


You
 know,
 and
 and
 and
 this
 this
 begs
 the


question
 about
 the
 the
 understanding
 of


safety
 and
 risk
 uh
 versus
 the
 benefit


that
 can
 occur.
 You
 know,
 I
 was
 sharing


with
 you
 about
 a
 family
 member
 who
 had


to
 wait
 a
 long
 time
 to
 get
 a
 certain


therapeutic
 and
 I
 was
 thinking
 about
 the


thousands
 of
 people
 that
 that
 died
 it
 in


that
 same
 period
 of
 time.
 Fortunately,


he
 was
 able
 to
 get
 the
 therapeutic,
 but


all
 the
 people
 that
 that
 died
 because


they
 couldn't
 get
 access
 to
 this
 drug.


How
 do
 we
 convey
 to
 the
 general


population
 the
 idea
 that
 speed
 matters


in
 saving
 lives
 and
 this
 question
 about


absolute
 safety
 and
 absolute
 risk
 around


drug
 approval?
 This
 is
 really
 important


when
 you
 talk
 about
 risk
 to
 a
 general


audience.
 How
 do
 you
 convey
 that
 second


order
 effect?


>> That's
 right.
 So
 safety
 is
 our
 number


one
 priority.
 We
 are
 to
 safeguard
 the


the
 public.
 But
 having
 8
 months
 of
 144


chimpanzees
 go
 undergoing
 studies
 has


risks
 to
 the
 general
 public.
 You
 may
 be


holding
 back
 a
 curative
 medication
 for
 8


months.
 Not
 identifying
 the
 efficacy
 in


a
 trial
 with
 basian
 statistics.
 um
 early


enough
 has
 risks
 because
 that
 extra
 lag


period
 is
 time
 when
 patients
 like
 the


patients
 that
 I
 treated
 at
 John's


Hopkins
 are
 told
 sorry
 we
 don't
 know
 of


anything
 out
 there
 so
 time
 delays
 that


are
 unnecessary
 have
 risks
 and
 I
 think


that
 is
 something
 we
 don't
 think
 about


in
 the
 FD
 you
 know
 enough
 at
 the
 FDA
 we


think
 oh
 we
 have
 this
 concern
 let's


sleep
 on
 it
 okay
 well
 you
 get
 a
 night
 to


sleep
 on
 it
 not
 9
 months


>> so
 I
 want
 to
 give
 a
 flip
 to
 this.
 The


right
 to
 try
 law
 gives
 patients
 access


to
 drugs
 that
 uh
 when
 they're
 in
 a


certain
 condition,
 they
 can
 access
 the


drug
 before
 it's
 gone
 through
 full


approvals.
 What's
 the
 current
 state
 of


right
 to
 try?
 Where
 do
 you
 view
 that


going?
 And
 does
 the
 threshold
 for
 right


to
 try
 change
 over
 time,
 giving
 patients


and
 their
 doctors
 more
 rights
 and
 more


access
 sooner
 or
 does
 the
 FDA
 still
 have


to
 hold
 firm?
 How
 do
 you
 think
 about


that
 over
 time?


>> So,
 I
 believe
 in
 both
 the
 letter
 and
 the


spirit
 of
 right
 to
 try.
 It's
 an
 amazing


achievement
 of
 U.
 President
 Trump
 in
 the


his
 first
 term
 and
 I
 have
 signed
 100%
 of


right
 to
 try
 requests
 that
 come
 across


my
 desk.
 Of
 course,
 the
 companies
 have


to
 agree
 to
 make
 the
 medication


available,
 but
 it's
 a
 great
 program
 and


like
 we
 don't
 want
 people
 getting
 spun


up
 on
 snake
 oil
 that
 doesn't
 work,


that's
 cost
 $3
 million
 where
 their


churches
 are
 doing
 GoFundMe
 campaigns


when
 we
 know
 a
 drug
 does
 not
 work.
 So,


we
 do
 have
 a
 responsibility
 and
 we
 do
 we


we
 have
 to
 be
 good
 stewards
 of
 the


Medicare
 program.
 They're
 using
 taxpayer


dollars
 to
 fund
 things.
 But
 if
 there's
 a


signal
 that
 something
 works
 and
 somebody


wants
 to
 try
 a
 drug,
 who
 are
 we
 to
 say


you
 can't?
 So,
 we
 look
 at
 safety,
 but


beyond
 safety,
 we
 are,
 you
 know,
 have
 to


be
 as
 flexible
 as
 possible
 with
 our
 uh


regulation.
 And
 we
 announced
 just
 this


week
 that
 we
 are
 getting
 rid
 of
 the
 some


of
 the
 regulatory
 requirements
 for
 cell


and
 gene
 therapy.
 Now
 those
 are
 used
 for


a
 lot
 of
 rare
 diseases,
 but
 we
 had


requirements
 uh
 what
 we
 call
 PPQ
 runs


for
 batches
 of
 um
 it's
 part
 of
 the


manufacturing
 requirements
 for
 cell
 and


gene
 therapies.
 We
 were
 holding
 them
 to


the
 same
 standards
 we
 were
 for
 say
 mass


manufacturing
 of
 a
 pill.
 Well,
 a
 cellar


gene
 therapy
 can
 be
 developed
 in
 a
 lab


at
 UCSF
 or
 Stanford.
 And
 are
 we
 going
 to


require
 that
 they
 use
 the
 same


manufacturing
 broad
 standards
 to
 do


multiple
 batches
 when
 you've
 got
 a


scientific
 platform
 that
 works,
 a
 vector


platform
 that
 works
 and
 you're
 basically


doing
 surgery
 on
 the
 human
 genome
 just


in
 different
 locations?
 So,
 we
 made
 that


announcement
 earlier
 this
 week.


>> So,
 let
 me
 just
 understand
 that
 one.


I've
 I've
 spent
 a
 little
 time
 in
 the


space.
 Does
 this
 mean
 that
 I
 will
 not


need
 to
 go
 through
 a
 GMP
 or
 good


manufacturing
 practice
 facility
 to
 bring


those
 therapeutics
 to
 a
 broader
 set
 of


patients?
 And
 does
 it
 also
 mean
 that


once
 I've
 got
 a
 system
 that
 works,
 I
 can


use
 it
 for
 different
 indications?
 And


maybe
 help
 understand
 a
 little
 bit
 about


where
 this
 goes
 because
 there's
 many


patients
 that
 today
 are
 looking
 at


papers
 on
 cell
 and
 gene
 therapies,
 early


data,
 and
 they're
 saying,
 "When
 can
 I


get
 access?
 I'm
 at
 risk."
 This
 matters
 a


lot
 to
 patients.
 and
 maybe
 you
 can
 help


contextualize
 how
 this
 translates
 into


speed
 and
 and
 access.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 the
 announcement
 that
 we
 made


on
 Sunday
 was
 that
 we're
 going
 to


customize
 the
 manufacturing
 requirements


to
 the
 drug
 and
 the
 population
 being


treated.
 So,
 there's
 a
 number
 of


flexibilities
 including
 the
 ones
 you


mentioned,
 but
 it's
 no
 longer
 going
 to


be
 this
 hard
 and
 fast.
 You
 have
 to
 do
 it


this
 way.
 For
 example,
 the
 three
 batch


runs
 that
 have
 been
 required,
 those


ingredients
 are
 expensive.
 I
 mean,
 those


ingredients
 could
 cost
 $100,000
 for
 just


one
 ingredient.
 And
 so,
 we
 have
 to
 use


common
 sense.
 I
 mean,
 when
 you
 see


something
 uh
 perform,
 you
 know,


something
 magical
 to
 a
 kid
 with
 no
 help


right
 in
 front
 of
 your
 eyes,
 you've
 got


to
 say
 like,
 what
 are
 we
 doing
 getting


in
 the
 way?
 We
 just
 um
 had
 early
 in
 u


our
 time
 there,
 baby
 KJ
 go
 from
 go
 home


from
 the
 hospital,
 right?
 So
 this
 infant


got
 gene
 editing
 therapy.
 You
 can't
 do
 a


randomized
 trial
 on
 that.
 There's
 not


enough
 kids
 who
 have
 it.
 So
 we
 these


bespoke
 therapies.
 We
 created


essentially
 a
 novel
 pathway
 for
 them.
 Uh


Dr.
 Vani
 Prasad
 uh
 described
 it
 in
 the


New
 England
 Journal
 of
 Medicine.
 It's


called
 the
 plausible
 mechanism
 pathway


and
 it's
 basically
 combining
 gold


standard
 science
 with
 common
 sense.


>> Right.
 And
 what
 about
 for
 CARTT
 therapy?


So
 there's
 this
 blossoming
 class
 of


therapeutics
 in
 CARTT
 that's


historically
 been
 used
 exclusively
 for


oncology
 for
 cancer.
 Um
 increasing


discussion
 about
 using
 it
 for
 autoimmune


conditions.
 Does
 this
 help
 with
 the


CARTT
 therapy
 pathway
 and
 enabling


faster
 routes
 to
 market
 and
 more
 access


and
 lower
 cost?


>> It
 can.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 CARTT
 is


amazing.
 Carti
 is
 amazing.
 I'm
 not
 here


to
 pro
 promote
 any
 one
 class
 of
 drugs


but
 I
 mean
 it
 the
 stuff
 that
 we
 have


seen
 um
 is
 mindboggling.


>> So
 yes


>> and
 just
 for
 folks
 to
 understand
 when


they
 take
 tea
 cells
 edit
 them
 and
 put


them
 back
 in
 the
 body
 and
 those
 tea


cells
 go
 after
 targets
 in
 the
 body
 and


destroy
 those
 targets
 and
 many
 blood


cancers
 uh
 are
 now
 seeing
 extraordinary


results
 with
 these
 CARTT
 therapies
 and


now
 they're
 going
 after
 autoimmune


conditions.
 But
 it
 definitely
 seems
 to


be
 that
 there
 there
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 faster


path
 to
 market,
 lower
 cost
 because
 the


pricing
 is
 half
 a
 million
 to
 a
 million


dollars
 still.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 amazing.
 We're
 essentially


activating
 your
 own
 immune
 cells
 to
 to


have
 a
 a
 very
 clear
 path
 and
 target


something
 in
 your
 body
 that
 needs
 to
 be


targeted.
 So
 it's
 now
 we
 did
 find
 um


that
 there
 was
 in
 the
 Biden


administration
 approval
 to
 have
 the


cells
 of
 Americans
 for
 CARTT
 therapy


shipped
 to
 China
 where
 the
 Chinese
 did


the
 gene
 editing
 and
 then
 ship
 back
 to


the
 United
 States
 to
 infuse
 in


Americans.
 When
 I
 found
 out
 about
 that,


we
 shut
 that
 thing
 down
 so
 fast.
 Yeah.


So,
 uh
 we
 have
 to
 do
 things
 carefully.


>> What
 else
 have
 you
 discovered
 since


you've
 been
 in
 the
 FDA
 that
 shocked


>> you?
 Just
 go
 on
 a
 side
 for
 a
 second.
 I'm


I'm
 curious
 to
 know
 what
 are
 the
 biggest


shocks
 that
 you've
 uncovered.
 I
 mean,


you've
 now
 been
 there
 for
 some
 time,
 you


mentioned
 before
 we
 sat
 down
 that
 you're


actively
 digitizing
 millions
 of
 files


>> that
 historically
 have
 not
 been


digitized,
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 assuming
 you
 can


now
 use
 AI
 and
 other
 tools
 to
 go
 read


through
 them
 very
 quickly.
 What's
 been


shocking
 to
 you?


>> Where
 do
 I
 start?
 I
 mean,
 somebody
 was


carrying
 a
 box
 from
 one
 building
 to


another
 building
 with
 uh
 with
 a
 um
 drug


file
 in
 it.
 And
 um
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 the


lawyers
 said
 they
 couldn't
 email
 the


information
 to
 the
 other
 center
 because,


you
 know,
 each
 center
 was
 like
 their
 own


secret
 government
 before
 we
 got
 there.


>> Each
 center
 of
 the
 FDA.


>> Each
 center
 of
 the
 FDA.


>> Same
 agency.


>> Yeah.
 Same
 agency.
 Seven
 centers.
 It
 was


like,
 you
 know,
 they
 had
 their
 own


boundaries
 and
 territories
 and,
 you


know,
 lawyers.
 They
 had
 their
 own


communication
 staff
 put
 out
 their
 own


releases,
 uh,
 their
 own
 press
 releases,


did
 their
 own
 legislative
 affairs
 with,


had
 scheduled
 their
 own
 hearings.


>> And
 the
 commissioner
 was
 out
 of
 the
 loop


sometimes.
 And
 so,
 we
 restructured
 the


entire
 agency.
 Now,
 we
 centralized
 those


services.
 But
 in
 the
 days
 of
 this
 sort


of
 siloed
 world
 of
 the
 agency,
 by
 the


way,
 it
 was
 a
 nightmare
 for
 uh


developers
 that
 had
 a
 drug
 device


combination.
 Um,
 right.


>> I
 mean,
 it
 was
 like
 gerrymandered
 lines


of
 what
 was
 included
 in
 one
 center


versus
 another
 center
 based
 on


infighting.
 And,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 people


had
 served
 long
 terms
 there.
 You
 know,


they'd
 serve
 terms
 like,
 uh,
 President


Mugab
 of
 Zimbabwe
 who'd
 been
 there,
 you


know,
 forever.
 These
 people
 just
 were


there
 forever,
 right?
 It
 was
 just
 their


way.
 And,
 uh,
 anytime
 there
 was
 an


opening
 in
 leadership,
 19
 times
 out
 of


20
 it
 went
 to
 an
 internal
 candidate.
 So,


you
 didn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 fresh
 new


ideas.
 We
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 fresh


scientists
 coming
 in
 there.
 I
 mentioned


the
 1,000
 new
 scientists.
 We're
 we're
 on


boarding
 right
 now
 um
 450
 of
 them.
 50
 of


them
 already
 just
 started.
 But
 um
 I've


met
 a
 guy
 who


uh
 his
 job
 was
 to
 change
 the
 ink


cartridge
 on
 a
 fax
 machine
 on
 one
 fax


machine.
 Uh
 like
 healthc
 care
 has


single-handedly
 kept
 the
 fax
 industry


alive.


>> Wow.


>> Um
 the
 guy's
 job
 was
 the
 ink
 guy
 on
 the


fax
 machine.
 to
 swap
 out
 the


>> machine.


>> There's
 a
 lot
 of
 that.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


that.


>> Well,
 let's
 shift
 over
 to
 food.
 Maybe


I'll
 just
 give
 you
 a
 moment
 to
 share


what
 you
 changed
 in
 the
 food
 pyramid
 in


the
 announcement
 last
 week.
 Why
 you
 made


those
 changes
 and
 why
 weren't
 they
 made


before?


Yeah.
 So,
 we
 have
 had
 decades
 of
 medical


dogma
 and
 corruption
 putting
 together


food
 pyramids
 that
 make
 no
 sense.
 people


can
 tell.
 I
 mean,
 the
 open
 secret
 was


that
 they
 make
 no
 sense.
 They're


scientifically
 inaccurate
 and
 they
 were


often
 times
 curated
 by
 the
 food
 industry


or
 the
 food
 industry's
 influence
 on


academia.
 Nutrition
 science
 may
 be
 one


of
 the
 most
 corrupted
 fields
 in
 all
 of


science.
 And
 it
 gave
 us
 the
 dogma
 that


we
 had
 to
 focus
 on
 saturated
 fat
 and


just
 eradicating
 natural
 healthy
 fats


from
 the
 US
 food
 supply.
 Ignoring
 that


you
 replace
 fats
 with
 healthy
 with


refined
 carbohydrates
 which
 are
 not


healthy.
 And
 we
 have
 this
 carbohydrate


heavy
 diet
 now
 for
 American
 children.


And
 guess
 what?
 38%
 of
 kids
 have


pre-diabetes
 or
 diabetes.
 Is
 that
 a


surprise?
 The
 rise
 has
 paralleled
 the


shift
 from
 saturated
 fat
 or
 regular
 food


to
 pumping
 refined
 carbohydrates
 and


added
 sugar.
 60
 to
 70%
 of
 the
 calories


of
 a
 child
 in
 America
 today
 are
 refined


carbohydrates.


No
 one
 has
 talked
 about
 it.
 It's
 been
 in


a
 blind
 spot
 as
 the
 medical


establishment
 has
 had
 this
 myopic
 focus


on
 the
 boogeyman
 of
 saturated
 fat.
 And


so
 we
 had
 a
 food
 pyramid
 that
 was


entirely
 backwards.
 And
 so
 we
 flipped
 it


upside
 down
 using
 good
 science
 talking


about
 a
 an
 previously
 ignored
 area
 of


nutrition.
 And
 that
 is
 the
 importance
 of


protein.
 We've
 been
 getting
 about
 half


the
 protein
 that
 we
 need.
 The
 protein


levels
 in
 the
 previous
 dietary
 guidance


was
 really
 just
 to
 prevent
 withering


away.


We
 want
 our
 American
 kids
 to
 thrive,


>> right?
 and
 and
 look
 at
 the
 status
 of


kids
 today.


Low
 in
 protein,


muscle
 wasting,
 weakness,


um
 underperforming
 in
 school,
 high
 in
 uh


refined
 carbohydrates
 and
 added
 sugar,


giving
 them
 that
 kind
 of
 uh
 sugar
 um


sort
 of
 coma,
 food
 coma
 after
 a
 refined


carbohydrate


uh
 breakfast.
 Again,
 we
 hit
 them
 hard
 in


the
 afternoon.
 They
 get
 very
 little
 or


no
 natural
 light
 exposure.
 They're
 told


to
 sit
 at
 a
 desk
 still
 for
 7
 hours
 a


day.
 They
 can't
 do
 it.
 And
 what
 do
 we


do?
 Tragically,


we
 have
 drugged
 our
 nation's
 kids
 at


scale.
 It's
 wrong.
 It
 needs
 to
 stop.
 We


have
 to
 reexamine
 the
 root
 causes.
 And


so,
 flipping
 this
 food
 pyramid
 upside


down,
 focusing
 on
 protein
 is
 the
 first


step.
 And
 so,
 I'm
 very
 proud
 of
 what
 we


were
 able
 to
 do.
 What
 have
 you
 uncovered


now
 that
 you've
 been
 inside
 the


organization
 and
 you
 can
 see
 paperwork


related
 to
 the
 legacy
 of
 how
 the
 old


food
 pyramid
 was
 constructed
 and


maintained
 for
 so
 long
 about
 the


motivations
 who
 was
 involved
 in
 setting


that
 food
 pyramid
 when
 you
 mentioned
 the


corruption
 of
 nutrition
 science.
 Help
 us


understand
 the
 root
 of
 that.
 So,
 I
 wrote


a
 book
 um
 just
 before
 coming
 into
 office


where
 I
 had
 a
 chance
 to
 do
 a
 deep
 dive


and
 do
 some
 investigative
 journalism,
 if


you
 will,
 to
 learn
 how
 this
 dogma
 of


what
 to
 eat
 got
 we
 got
 so
 wrong.
 And
 I


think
 it
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 group
 think
 just


like
 we
 saw
 with
 opioids
 are
 not


addictive.
 Medical
 establishment
 got


that
 wrong
 for
 15
 years.


Uh,
 young
 kids
 should
 avoid
 peanut


butter
 until
 they
 turn
 three.
 We
 got


that
 wrong
 for
 16
 years.
 Tragically


wrong.
 Igniting
 the
 modern-day
 peanut


allergy
 epidemic
 because
 peanut
 butter


exposure
 in
 infancy


reduces
 there's
 something
 called
 immune


tolerance,
 right?
 And
 it
 reduces
 the


risk
 of
 peanut
 allergies.
 We're
 the
 only


country
 in
 the
 world
 that
 has
 high
 rates


of
 peanut
 allergies
 along
 with
 UK
 and
 a


few
 other
 European
 countries
 that
 fell


for
 our
 dogma
 based
 recommendation
 to


avoid
 peanut
 butter
 till
 the
 kid
 turns


three.
 And
 so
 we
 got
 that
 180
 degrees


wrong.
 And
 so
 there
 are
 dogmas
 in
 the


medical
 field
 that
 take
 on
 a
 life
 of


their
 own
 and
 you're
 not
 allowed
 to


question
 them.
 And
 we
 saw
 a
 little
 bit


of
 it
 during
 COVID
 if
 you
 recognized


natural
 immunity
 and
 may
 not
 need
 to
 be


fired
 from
 your
 job
 because
 you
 have


circulating
 antibodies
 to
 COVID,
 but


they
 were
 just
 antibodies
 that
 the


government
 did
 not
 recognize.


This
 dogma
 can
 take
 on
 a
 life
 of
 its


own.
 And
 so
 we're
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 to


gold
 standard
 objective
 science.
 It
 is


crazy
 that
 the
 fundamental
 premise
 of


science
 is
 you
 ask
 a
 question
 and
 then


you
 test
 whether
 there's
 one
 answer
 or


another.
 And
 the
 idea
 that
 you
 can't
 ask


questions
 indicates
 that
 it's
 not


science
 from
 my
 point
 of
 view.
 All


standards
 should
 be
 challengeable.
 That


you
 should
 be
 able
 to
 ask
 the
 questions


and
 fundamentally
 if
 they
 they
 hold


truth
 or
 they
 hold
 ground
 then
 great.


Let's
 maintain
 them.
 And
 if
 they
 don't


we
 should
 be
 able
 to
 change.
 And
 then


they
 use
 the
 word
 science
 or


historically
 the
 word
 science
 has
 been


then
 used
 to
 justify
 not
 testing


something.


>> That's
 right.


>> It's
 it's
 crazy
 to
 me.
 What
 are
 the


roles
 that
 food
 companies
 have
 played?


What
 are
 the
 roles
 that
 folks
 that
 might


have
 an
 economic
 incentive
 in
 keeping


the
 food
 pyramid
 as
 it
 was
 played


historically
 in
 this?
 And
 is
 that


permanently
 changed
 at
 this
 point
 or
 is


it
 changed
 while
 this
 administration
 is


here
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 change
 again
 next


cycle?
 help
 us
 understand
 a
 little
 bit


about
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 role
 that


industry
 has
 in
 influencing
 some
 of
 this


regulatory
 process.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 the
 industry
 did
 what
 the


medical
 field
 told
 them
 to
 do
 and
 that


is
 to
 address
 the
 risk
 of
 mass


starvation
 and
 deal
 with
 food
 insecurity


and
 that
 calories
 in
 equals
 calories
 out


regardless
 of
 where
 those
 calories
 come


from.
 That
 was
 the
 dogma
 and
 sort
 of
 the


the
 mandate
 to
 the
 food
 industry.
 So
 um


they
 did
 what
 they
 were
 told
 to
 do
 and


so
 they
 moved
 to
 refined
 carbohydrates.


They
 stripped
 the
 grains
 of
 fiber
 to


mass-produce
 them.
 They
 would
 even
 chop


them
 up
 which
 made
 them
 increase
 your


glycemic
 index.
 That
 is
 it
 basically


function
 like
 sugar.
 So
 you
 have


cereals,
 breads,
 pastas
 functioning
 like


sugar.
 And
 so
 we
 ushered
 in
 a
 generation


of
 kids
 and
 you
 and
 I
 were
 the
 first


gener
 who
 were
 part
 of
 this
 the
 first


generation
 in
 human
 history
 with
 massive


insulin
 spikes
 daytoday
 in
 our
 normal


everyday
 life.
 We've
 never
 seen
 insulin


spikes
 to
 that
 degree.
 And
 of
 course


that
 drives
 something
 called
 insulin


resistance.
 That
 is
 the
 the
 organs
 in


your
 body
 that
 do
 important
 functions


are
 trying
 to
 block
 out
 all
 this
 extra


glucose.
 And
 so
 they
 kind
 of
 um
 uh


change
 the
 configuration
 of
 the
 insulin


receptor
 to
 just
 try
 to
 resist
 all
 this


sugar
 coming
 in.
 And
 it
 is
 at
 the
 root


of
 almost
 every
 chronic
 disease.
 Insulin


resistance,
 general
 body
 inflammation.


And
 we
 never
 talk
 about
 these
 things.


Never.
 So
 we
 talked
 about
 them
 front
 and


center
 in
 our
 new
 uh
 guidance.
 The
 types


of
 grains
 matter.
 It's
 not
 calories
 in


equals
 calories
 out.
 It's
 not
 you
 can


have
 this
 if
 you
 sit
 on
 the
 treadmill


for
 this
 amount
 of
 minutes.
 We've
 got
 to


talk
 about
 the
 soil
 that
 food
 comes
 from


and
 the
 farming
 techniques
 that
 animal


products
 come
 from
 and
 the
 cleanliness


and
 chemical-free
 waters
 that
 seafood


comes
 from
 and
 the
 importance
 of
 protein


and
 the
 value
 of
 whole
 grains
 and
 what


we
 call
 real
 food.
 And
 so
 the
 website
 is


realfood.gov.
 My
 only
 criticism
 is
 the


lack
 of
 vegetarian
 protein
 in
 the
 top
 of


the
 pyramid
 where
 as
 a
 vegetarian
 I
 eat


eggs
 and
 dairy.
 It
 could
 use
 a
 few
 more


nuts
 and
 beans
 up
 top,
 but
 you
 know,


I'll
 talk
 to
 Joe
 Gibbia
 about
 it.


>> It
 could.
 No,
 it
 could.
 I
 think
 the
 New


York
 Times
 had
 a
 conception
 about
 blue


the
 blueberries.


>> The
 blueberries.


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 uh
 uh
 disproportionately


uh
 disturbingly
 large


>> disturbingly
 large
 blueberries.
 That
 was


the
 criticism.
 Okay,
 that
 wasn't
 one


that
 bothered
 me.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 the


the
 adult
 population.
 I
 think
 40
 to
 60%


depending
 on
 how
 you
 measure
 it
 are


obese
 clinically
 obese
 in
 this
 country


and
 these
 incretin
 mimedics
 GLP1
 drugs


and
 others
 have
 really
 taken
 the
 market


by
 storm
 taken
 our
 population
 by
 storm.


So
 I
 realize
 that
 much
 of
 this
 is
 in


response
 to
 an
 obesity
 epidemic
 that


we're
 facing
 in
 this
 country.
 But
 it


turns
 out
 that
 these
 incretin
 mimedics


may
 actually
 have
 other
 systemic


benefits
 and
 they're
 now
 I
 think
 there's


60
 indications
 that
 they're
 being
 tested


against
 including
 kidney
 neurological


cardiac.
 I
 mean
 there's
 there
 seems
 to


be
 a
 lot
 of
 benefit
 potentially
 in
 uh


using
 them
 for
 other
 disease


indications.
 Can
 you
 speak
 a
 little
 bit


about
 your
 view
 on
 where
 this
 market


where
 this
 class
 of
 therapeutics
 is


headed?
 Is
 this
 something
 that
 some


people
 have
 estimated
 or
 60%
 of


Americans
 are
 going
 to
 be
 on?
 And
 if
 it


is
 the
 case,
 does
 that
 mean
 we
 failed


with
 our
 food
 system?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 we
 have
 failed
 with


our
 food
 system.
 Look
 at
 the
 fact
 that


40%
 of
 American
 kids
 have
 a
 chronic


disease.


Between
 the
 lines
 in
 the
 medical


textbooks
 in
 medical
 school
 was
 kind
 of


a
 blaming
 of
 children
 for
 not
 having
 the


discipline.
 And
 it's
 not
 a
 willpower


problem.
 This
 is
 highly
 addictive
 uh


chemicalized
 foods
 that
 are


ultrarocessed
 that
 are
 put
 in
 front
 of


kids
 and
 they
 want
 more
 and
 you
 you
 put


these
 vibrant
 colors
 in
 them
 from
 the


petroleum
 based
 dyes.
 And
 so
 this
 is


something
 adults
 have
 done
 to
 kids.
 And


so
 I
 think
 that
 we
 have
 failed.
 We've


given
 people
 the
 wrong
 information.
 The


calories
 in
 equals
 calories
 out,
 this


demonization
 of
 fat
 and
 all
 that
 stuff


we
 talked
 about.
 um
 GLP-1s
 are
 mimicking


a
 natural
 hormone
 in
 the
 body.
 And
 so


when
 you
 get
 a
 supplementation
 of
 that,


it's
 doing
 the
 job
 of
 increasing


satiety,
 slowing
 down
 GI
 motility,
 and


it
 has
 a
 profound
 impact
 on
 a
 number
 of


conditions
 because
 you
 are
 also
 reducing


insulin
 resistance
 and
 general
 body


inflammation.
 And
 so
 that's
 why
 we're


seeing
 so
 many
 other
 benefits.
 Plus,
 you


feel
 better.
 When
 you
 feel
 better,


you're
 going
 to
 have
 benefits
 you
 don't


even
 we
 haven't
 even
 appreciated
 yet


because
 there's
 an
 incredible
 value
 this


sort
 of
 positive
 thinking.
 We've
 seen
 it


in
 a
 breast
 in
 a
 lung
 cancer
 study
 from


Mass
 General.
 They
 randomize
 people
 to


palative
 support
 versus
 chemotherapy
 and


the
 palative
 support
 did
 better
 even


though
 chemo
 drug
 is
 is
 more
 effective


than
 standard
 of
 care.
 So,
 um,
 you
 see


this
 incredible
 value
 to
 sort
 of


positive
 thinking
 and
 maybe
 that's
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 we're
 seeing
 reductions


in
 addiction.
 Maybe
 we're,
 you
 know,


we're
 seeing
 cardiac
 benefits.
 So,
 we'll


see.
 I
 mean,
 we're,
 you
 know,
 as
 a


regulator,
 we're
 a
 referee
 and
 we
 want


to
 see
 products
 come
 to
 market
 quickly


and
 safely,
 but
 I
 think
 we're
 we're


we're
 at
 a
 pretty
 interesting
 time.


>> Yeah.
 Just
 to
 go
 back
 on
 the
 China
 point


because
 we
 did
 talk
 about


competitiveness
 with
 respect
 to
 speed,


but
 the
 other
 piece
 I
 wanted
 to
 address


was


>> uh
 funding
 of
 research.
 So
 that
 uh
 that


bioh
 technology
 council
 I
 mentioned


recommended
 a
 $15
 billion
 kind
 of
 rushed


investment
 in
 in
 research.
 When
 I
 meet


with
 scientists,
 there's
 a
 view
 that
 the


Trump
 administration
 is
 anti-science,
 is


defunding
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 institutions


in
 the
 United
 States
 that
 are
 going
 to


save
 people's
 lives
 and
 develop
 amazing


cures.
 Why
 are
 they
 doing
 this?
 There's


this
 council
 that
 recommends
 that
 even


in
 the
 face
 of
 China,
 they're
 putting


out
 tremendous
 funding
 to
 support


research
 scientists
 coming
 up
 with
 those


next
 set
 of
 molecules
 or
 therapeutic


modalities
 that
 are
 going
 to
 change


lives
 and
 improve
 lives.
 Maybe
 you
 can


comment
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 are
 we
 funding


through
 the
 government
 enough
 scientific


research?
 What's
 the
 right
 steady
 state


for
 us?
 And
 how
 do
 we
 address
 the
 the


points
 about
 the
 Trump
 administration


being
 anti-science?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 look,
 we
 live
 in
 uh
 partisan


times
 now
 where
 people
 get
 spun
 up
 and


they're
 in
 sort
 of
 a
 toxic
 polarization.


And
 the
 truth
 is,
 if
 we
 want
 to
 know
 the


facts,
 is
 that
 in
 the
 Trump


administration,
 we
 have
 not
 cut
 $1
 of


NIH
 funding.
 We
 have
 not
 cut
 $1
 to
 the


general
 Medicaid
 budget.
 That
 is
 the


overall
 Medicaid
 fund.
 And
 the
 proposal


for
 the
 future
 is
 to
 increase
 Medicaid


by
 $200
 billion.
 So
 you
 hear
 all
 the


time,
 oh,
 Trump
 cut
 Medicaid,
 Trump
 cut


the
 NIH.
 No,
 what
 we
 want
 to
 see
 is


reallocating
 money
 at
 the
 NIH
 from
 just


chemotherapy
 and
 proton
 beam
 therapy


work
 to
 study
 food
 as
 medicine
 and


school
 lunch
 programs.
 and
 the


microbiome
 and
 gut
 health.
 We've
 got
 to


start
 talking
 about
 school
 lunch


programs,
 not
 just
 putting
 every


six-year-old
 on
 ompic.
 We've
 got
 to
 talk


about
 the
 quality
 of
 sleep
 as
 it
 as
 it


is
 a
 cause
 of
 high
 blood
 pressure
 when


you
 sleep
 poorly
 instead
 of
 just


throwing
 people
 on
 anti-hypertensive


medications.
 We've
 got
 to
 talk
 about


environmental
 exposures
 that
 cause


cancer,
 not
 just
 the
 chemo
 to
 treat
 it.


And
 so,
 we
 want
 to
 see
 funding
 go
 to


root
 causes
 of
 diseases.
 And
 that
 is


something
 that
 that
 has
 been


unfortunately
 in
 a
 blind
 spot
 because


the
 culture
 of
 the
 NIH
 is
 the
 culture
 of


Francis
 Collins
 and
 Tony
 Fouchy
 and
 the


group
 for
 the
 last
 50
 years
 that
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 oversimplify
 it.
 The
 gene
 is


responsible
 for
 our
 health
 problems
 and


the
 gene
 can
 solve
 all
 of
 our
 health


problems.
 Well,
 look,
 I
 believe
 in
 gene


therapy
 and
 we're
 doing
 amazing
 stuff


with
 that.
 But
 where's
 the
 research
 on


why
 one
 in
 six
 girls
 today
 will
 develop


an
 autoimmune
 disease?
 What's
 triggering


that
 antibbody
 response?
 What
 of
 the


many
 exposures
 in
 the
 life
 of
 a
 child
 is


causing
 their
 bodies
 to
 be
 triggered?


These
 studies
 can
 be
 done.
 It's
 not
 that


difficult
 to
 model
 the
 antibbody


that's
 involved
 in
 type
 1
 diabetes
 or
 MS


and
 exposures
 in
 the
 environment
 to
 see


if
 it
 is
 triggering
 that
 same


configuration
 that
 the
 antibbody
 binds


to.
 But
 no
 one's
 been
 interested
 in
 it


because
 everything
 has
 been
 about
 coming


up
 with
 a,
 you
 know,
 treatment
 when
 we


have
 to
 look
 at
 causes,


>> right?
 And
 the
 scientists
 on
 the
 ground


see
 their
 funding
 go
 away.
 They


complain.
 They
 get
 media
 attention.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 amplification
 of
 those


stories.
 So
 is
 that
 not
 the
 fundamental


truth
 because
 the
 money
 is
 being


reallocated
 to
 other
 scientists
 and


other
 research
 institutions?


>> Correct.
 So
 um
 14%
 of
 NIH
 funding
 went


to
 DEI
 research.
 14%


>> 14%
 of
 NI
 NIH
 grants
 went
 to
 DEI


research


>> and
 NIH
 grants
 are
 about
 40
 billion
 a


year.
 Does
 that
 sound


>> uh
 it's
 it's
 a
 little
 over
 20
 billion
 in


terms
 of
 grants
 that
 go
 out
 the
 door
 but


about
 47
 billion
 for
 the
 entire
 NIH


budget
 because
 they
 run
 their
 own


hospital
 and
 clinical
 center
 and
 others.


>> So
 um
 so
 if
 you
 think
 and
 and
 by
 the
 way


I'm
 all
 for
 anything
 that
 reduces
 health


disparities.


>> Yeah.
 and
 increases
 access.
 But
 these


grants
 were
 not
 doing
 it.
 It
 was
 just


describing
 health
 disparities.
 Well,


it's
 it's
 we
 already
 know
 there
 are


health
 disparities.
 Simply
 describing


them
 with
 another
 50
 studies
 in
 JAMAMA


does
 not
 help
 people
 who
 are
 suffering


from
 these
 health
 disparities.
 So,
 um


we've
 seen
 money
 shifted
 to
 root
 causes


and
 areas
 of
 research
 that
 we
 need
 to


study
 that
 we've
 not
 studied.
 At
 the


FDA,
 we
 have
 put
 a
 big
 emphasis
 on
 the


value
 of
 hormone
 replacement
 therapy
 for


post-menopausal
 women.
 Something
 the
 NIH


demonized
 for
 the
 last
 22
 years,
 saying


that
 women
 shouldn't
 take
 it
 because
 it


causes
 cancer.
 Um,
 when
 we
 came
 in,
 the


NIH
 was
 a
 mess.
 Almost
 all
 the
 money
 was


going
 to
 genetic
 research,
 which
 then


becomes
 the
 priority
 of
 every
 academic


institution.
 They're
 not
 studying
 causes


and
 food
 and
 the
 microbiome
 and
 cutting


edge
 areas
 of
 of of
 science.
 And
 they


just
 had
 this
 myopic
 focus
 on
 one
 area.


It's
 an
 important
 area,
 but
 it's
 one


area.
 They
 were
 funding
 the
 Wuhan
 lab


to,
 you
 know,
 get
 bat
 corona
 viruses
 and


insert
 a
 furine
 cleavage
 site
 so
 it


could
 infect
 humans.
 What
 are
 you
 doing?


It's
 a
 bunch
 of
 mad
 scientists.
 Um,
 and


14%
 of
 grants
 were
 going
 to
 DEI.
 So
 the


NIH
 when
 we
 came
 in
 was
 a
 mess.
 And


under
 President
 Trump,
 it
 is
 massively


being
 reformed.
 And
 Jay
 Bodyario
 is


doing
 a
 great
 job.


>> Okay,
 let's
 shift
 over
 to
 vaccines.
 Our


wives
 had
 kids
 around
 the
 same
 time.


Hope
 yours
 is
 doing
 well.


>> Great.
 He's
 great.
 Thanks
 for
 asking.


>> Yeah.
 And
 we
 talked
 about
 the
 HEP


vaccine,
 which
 we
 declined
 on
 the
 day
 he


was
 born.


>> Cuz
 I
 started
 going
 very
 deep
 on
 what's


the
 origin
 of
 the
 HEP
 vaccine
 the
 day


that
 the
 child
 is
 born.
 Why
 why
 is
 this


being
 given
 to
 them?
 We
 have
 no
 HEP
 B


exposure
 in
 our
 household.
 We
 don't
 need


it.
 Doesn't
 protect
 anyone
 else.
 What


are
 we
 doing
 this
 for?
 You
 end
 up
 going


down
 these
 rabbit
 holes
 and
 a
 lot
 of


again
 what
 you
 mentioned
 earlier,
 you


take
 for
 dogma
 and
 you
 recognize,
 wait
 a


second,
 there
 may
 be
 some
 unfounded


principles
 at
 play
 here.
 I
 should
 not
 be


doing
 this.
 And
 we
 make
 a
 a
 difficult


decision
 against
 the
 tide
 and
 the


recommendations
 and
 suddenly
 you're
 in


the
 social
 conflict
 with
 people
 around


you,
 right?
 And
 it
 was
 very
 hard.


>> You
 guys
 recently
 made
 some
 big
 changes


to
 the
 vaccine
 schedule.


I'd
 love
 to
 hear
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 how


those
 changes
 were
 made,
 what
 were
 the


big
 changes,
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


what
 got
 us
 to
 this
 point
 where
 when
 you


look
 at
 the
 data,
 you're
 like,
 "Wait
 a


second,
 right?


>> That
 may
 not
 make
 as
 much
 sense."
 Yeah.


>> I'm
 just
 laughing
 as
 you
 talk,
 Dave,
 cuz


you
 do,
 you
 know,
 you
 just
 ask
 some
 good


questions
 like,
 "Does
 does
 my
 newborn
 on


the
 in
 the
 first
 hour
 of
 life
 need
 to
 be


injected
 with
 a
 hepatitis
 B
 vaccine
 when


the
 mom
 is
 hep
 negative?"
 And
 within
 a


matter
 of
 weeks
 of
 having
 broader


conversations,
 you
 feel
 like
 you're
 a


fugitive
 of
 the
 law,
 like
 you've
 done


something,
 you
 know,
 terribly
 wrong
 for


choosing
 not
 to
 vaccinate.
 We
 went


through
 the
 same
 thing
 and
 and
 and
 you


know,
 being
 a
 part
 of
 having
 a
 kid
 is
 so


special.
 You
 know,
 we
 were
 talking
 about


that.
 So,
 yeah,
 we
 just
 went
 through


this.
 Our
 son
 was
 born
 about
 6
 months


ago
 and,
 you
 know,
 the
 uh
 we
 were


offered
 the
 hepatitis
 B
 shot.
 Now,
 maybe


they
 figured
 out
 who
 I
 was
 and
 didn't


push
 it
 as
 hard
 as
 some
 of
 my
 friends


have
 had
 that
 it
 pushed
 on
 them
 and
 we


declined.
 Um,
 you're
 preventing
 with


hepatitis
 B
 an
 infection
 that
 is
 a


sexually
 transmitted
 infection
 or
 can
 be


uh
 get
 it
 from
 a
 uh
 bloodborne
 pathogen


exposure.
 Uh,
 so
 that's
 not
 going
 to


happen
 until
 they're
 a
 teenager
 at
 least


or
 further
 down
 the
 road.
 But
 when
 you


ask
 the
 question
 immediately
 you
 get


this
 sort
 of
 antivax
 label
 or
 um


>> or
 you
 have
 to
 qualify
 that's
 right


>> I'm
 not
 an
 antivaxer
 but
 I'm
 asking
 this


what
 what
 right
 what's
 going
 on
 here


this
 sort
 of
 McCarthyism
 around
 this
 uh


schedule
 which
 by
 the
 way
 the
 United


States
 vaccine
 schedule
 was
 an


international
 outlier
 with
 72
 doses


recommended
 between
 the
 ages
 of
 zero
 and


18.
 So,
 President
 Trump
 asked
 us
 to


review
 the
 um
 international


landscape
 of
 vaccine
 recommendations
 and


we
 looked
 at
 20
 other
 developed


countries
 and
 found
 that
 not
 only
 are
 we


the
 international
 outlier
 in
 in
 how
 high


the
 number
 of
 doses
 we
 recommend
 is
 but


that
 there's
 a
 consensus
 of
 a
 group
 of


core
 essential
 vaccines
 and
 we
 wanted
 to


put
 that
 in
 front
 of
 the
 American
 people


to
 say
 look
 all
 vaccines
 are
 still


recommended
 by
 the
 CDC
 but
 here
 are
 a


list
 of
 core
 essential
 vaccines.
 So
 we


gave
 them
 a
 list
 that
 constitutes
 about


38
 doses
 from
 age
 0
 to
 18.
 And
 the
 idea


is
 to
 increase
 vaccination
 rates
 among


children
 that
 have
 been
 dropping
 because


of
 a
 loss
 in
 public
 trust
 by
 saying


here's
 a
 hierarchy
 of
 what
 we
 believe
 to


be
 a
 list
 of
 core
 essential
 vaccines.
 I


don't
 want
 to
 see
 someone
 because
 you


know
 a
 um
 a
 doctor's
 pushing
 the
 sixth


COVID
 booster
 in
 a
 young
 healthy


12-year-old
 girl.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 see


the
 mom
 say,
 "Well,
 I'm
 not
 going to
 get


the
 measel
 shot
 in
 my
 next
 with
 for
 my


next
 child
 because
 I
 am
 something's
 not


right
 about
 this."
 38
 is
 better
 than


zero.
 You
 can
 still
 get
 them
 all.


They're
 all
 paid
 for,
 but
 we
 have
 a
 hard


time
 in
 the
 medical
 culture,
 and
 this
 is


part
 of
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 sociology
 of


medicine,
 meeting
 people
 where
 they're


at.
 For
 example,
 as
 a
 cancer
 surgeon,
 I


would
 see
 women
 tell
 me
 they
 don't
 want


to
 get
 a
 mammogram.


I
 I
 disagree.
 I
 think
 they're
 safe,
 but


a
 woman
 may
 have
 be
 concerned
 about
 the


radiation,
 the
 discomfort,
 the


inconvenience.
 40%
 of
 women
 who
 are


candidates
 for
 a
 mammog
 are
 not
 getting


a
 mammogram
 in
 the
 United
 States
 today.


Showing
 you
 the
 massive
 disconnect


between
 the
 medical
 field
 and
 where


people
 are
 at.
 Now,
 you
 know
 what
 we


should
 be
 doing
 is
 we
 should
 tell
 those


40%
 of
 women,
 how
 about
 an
 ultrasound?


It
 picks
 up
 90
 to
 95%
 of
 the
 lesions


that
 a
 mammogram
 would
 pick
 up.
 But


doctors
 don't
 recommend
 an
 ultrasound


because


you're
 violating
 the
 gold
 standard
 and


there's
 liability
 and
 there's,
 you
 know,


and
 you're
 you're
 practicing
 substandard


care
 and
 women
 may
 tell
 other
 women
 that


they
 can
 also
 get
 an
 ultrasound
 and
 we


don't
 want
 women
 getting
 an
 ultrasound


instead
 of
 the
 paternalism
 that
 results


in
 this
 disconnect
 is
 hurting
 people
 in


the
 United
 States
 today.
 And
 so
 with


identifying
 the
 list
 of
 core
 essential


vaccines,
 we
 are
 trying
 to
 meet
 people


where
 they
 are
 at
 to
 see
 more


vaccinations
 because
 childhood
 vaccines


have
 declined
 over
 the
 last
 four
 years


of
 co
 because
 people
 have
 lost
 trust
 in


the
 dogma
 of
 the
 cloth
 masks
 for


toddlers
 and
 vaccine
 boosters
 in


perpetuity
 and
 you
 have
 to
 fire
 a


teacher
 if
 if
 she
 already
 had
 CO.
 Ignore


natural
 beauty.
 You
 have
 they
 have
 to
 be


fired
 from
 their
 job.
 that
 um
 absolutism


has
 caused
 tremendous
 damage
 and
 we're


trying
 to
 rebuild
 public
 trust.
 What's


frustrating
 to
 me
 to
 observe
 is
 there


are
 now
 states
 like
 California
 and
 the


California
 DPH
 that
 are
 saying
 we're


going
 to
 set
 our
 own
 vaccine
 schedule.


We're
 not
 going
 to
 listen
 to
 the
 FDA,
 to


the
 HHS
 anymore
 because
 they
 don't
 know


what
 they're
 doing
 because
 they're
 Trump


admin.
 They're
 not
 doctors.
 They're
 not


scientists.
 Clearly,
 this
 is
 all


political.
 And
 is
 there
 a
 process
 of


engagement
 that
 you
 and
 your


organization
 go
 through
 to
 try
 and
 bring


some
 of
 these
 other
 folks
 along
 with


you?
 Because
 I
 think
 the
 point
 you
 just


made
 can't
 be
 a
 point
 that
 they
 can


fundamentally
 disagree
 with.
 What
 is


what
 is
 the
 process
 by
 which
 we
 can


break
 the
 political
 ranker
 around
 things


like
 vaccines
 and
 just
 take
 a
 very


clear-cut
 scientific
 approach
 and
 get


people
 aligned
 around
 this?
 Do
 you
 do


engagement
 on
 this
 stuff?


>> I
 don't.
 Look,
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 sad
 we


have
 this
 toxic
 polarization
 that's


crept
 in.
 It's
 it's
 in
 society,
 but
 it's


now
 crept
 into
 medicine


>> and
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 character
 attacks.
 I


mean,
 it
 was
 put
 together
 by
 doctors


with
 impeccable
 credentials.

 and
 you


cannot
 have
 an
 honest
 conversation.
 I


talked
 to
 doctors
 and
 they
 they've
 never


heard
 of
 a
 vaccine
 they
 didn't
 love.


Anthrax
 vaccine
 was
 a
 disaster.
 H3N
 N3


killed
 people.
 It
 was
 a
 disaster
 taken


off
 the
 market.
 Rotovirus
 vaccine
 in


1999
 taken
 off
 the
 market
 because
 kids


were
 dying
 from
 interception.
 Roto
 virus


is
 not
 in
 our
 core
 essential
 vaccine


schedule
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Overseas


it's
 a
 little
 different
 but
 in
 in
 what


we
 put
 out
 it's
 not
 in
 there.
 After
 mass


vaccination
 with
 roto
 virus
 the
 number


of
 deaths
 per
 year
 went
 from
 3
 to
 1.6


>> or
 round
 it
 up
 let's
 say
 two
 went
 from


three
 to
 two
 with
 mass
 vaccination


>> and
 the
 vaccine
 that
 was
 used
 up
 until


1999
 was
 taken
 off
 the
 market
 for
 safety


concerns.
 So
 when
 you
 have
 a
 parent
 ask


a
 question
 about
 the
 necessity
 or
 we


cannot
 respond
 with
 absolutism,
 American


medicine
 needs
 to
 show
 some
 humility.


When
 I
 had
 a
 patient
 asked
 me
 a
 question


I
 didn't
 know
 the
 right
 answer,
 I
 don't


know.
 Maybe
 I'll
 look
 into
 that.
 Maybe


one
 of
 my
 colleagues
 knows
 in
 co
 during


COVID,
 the
 right
 answer
 many
 times
 was


we
 don't
 know.


>> Do
 you
 find
 that
 there's
 a
 path
 forward?


>> I
 hope
 so.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 we're
 hoping
 to


restore
 gold
 standard
 science
 and
 just


talk
 objectively
 about
 it.
 We've
 had


universities
 uh
 cancel
 uh
 crush
 censor


railroad
 doctors
 that,
 you
 know,
 pose


different
 ideas
 about
 things.
 And
 I'm


not
 I'm
 not
 talking
 about
 the
 political


hot
 button
 issues.
 I'm
 talking
 about
 the


fact
 that
 ulcers
 were
 not
 caused
 by


stress.
 They
 were
 caused
 by
 a
 bacteria


called
 H.
 pylori.
 Well,
 that
 guy
 was,


you
 know,
 railroaded.
 his
 research
 was


rejected
 from
 the
 national
 uh
 meetings


and
 then
 he
 gets
 the
 Nobel
 Prize
 because


he
 ends
 up
 being
 correct.
 So
 it's
 it's


not
 good
 for
 science.


>> Most
 great
 scientists
 start
 out
 as


heretics
 just
 to
 be
 clear
 by
 the
 way.


That's
 right.
 Yeah.
 So
 Marty,
 one
 of
 the


other
 big
 challenges
 that
 we
 talk
 a
 lot


about
 in
 this
 country
 is
 the
 cost
 of


drugs.
 Healthcare
 today
 costs
 roughly


15%
 of
 our
 GDP.
 That's
 an
 insane


statistic
 and
 it
 is
 rising
 year
 after


year
 in
 the
 United
 States
 and
 it's
 such


a
 complex
 issue.
 By
 some
 measurements


though,
 the
 price
 of
 drugs
 in
 the
 United


States
 is
 almost
 three
 times
 what
 it
 is


outside
 the
 United
 States.
 So
 I'd
 love


to
 hear
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the
 specific


role
 of
 pricing
 drugs.
 What
 sort
 of


actions
 have
 you
 guys
 taken
 and
 can
 you


take
 to
 help
 bring
 down
 the
 price
 of


drugs
 for
 patients,
 for
 for
 care


providers,
 for
 insurance
 companies,
 and


ultimately
 for
 the
 economy?


>> It's
 been
 the
 great
 American
 ripoff.
 You


could
 buy
 a
 GLP-1
 drug
 for
 $1,300
 in
 the


United
 States
 and
 go
 to
 London,
 it
 sells


for
 $88.
 Or
 you
 go
 to
 Germany
 or
 France


and
 buy
 any
 of
 the
 drugs
 that
 are
 cost
 a


lot
 of
 money
 in
 the
 United
 States
 and


they're
 half
 a
 third
 or
 a
 quarter
 the


price.
 And
 so,
 President
 Trump
 has
 given


us
 a
 clear
 charge
 and
 he
 says,
 "Look,


we're
 the
 largest
 purchasers
 of
 drugs.


We
 want
 the
 best
 price
 in
 the
 developed


world.
 It's
 called
 most
 favored
 nation


status
 pricing.
 And
 thanks
 to
 Dr.
 Oz
 and


and
 Chris
 Clamp
 and
 others
 at
 CMS,
 we


did
 our
 part
 at
 the
 FDA
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of


this.
 Uh
 we've
 gotten
 drug
 companies
 to


the
 table
 and
 we've
 got
 them
 to
 agree
 to


most
 favoration
 status
 pricing.
 That's


going
 to
 radically
 lower
 the
 price
 of


drugs.
 With
 the
 GLP1
 example,
 for


example,
 it's
 going
 to
 come
 down
 to
 $149


for
 the
 first
 three
 months.
 Um,
 other


countries
 are
 going
 to
 pay
 more.
 We
 have


been
 financing
 60%
 of
 the
 R&D
 cost
 to


pharma
 companies.
 Other
 countries
 need


to
 pay
 their
 fair
 share.
 And
 when
 it


comes
 to
 this
 president,
 would
 be
 it


NATO
 membership
 fees
 or
 whatever,
 he


wants
 to
 see
 other
 countries
 paying


their
 fair
 share.
 And
 so,
 we're
 getting


that
 delivered.
 Another
 big
 way
 in
 which


we
 are
 going
 to
 lower
 drug
 prices


is
 by
 cutting
 the
 red
 tape
 at
 the
 FDA


for
 bio
 biologic
 drugs.
 So
 most
 51%
 of


the
 So
 let
 me
 back
 up
 for
 a
 second.
 The


fastest
 area
 of
 healthc
 care
 spending


growth
 is
 drug
 price
 spending
 growth.


And
 the
 fastest
 area
 of
 drug
 price


spending
 growth
 are
 a
 class
 of
 medic


medications
 called
 biologics.
 which


means
 you
 need
 a
 cell
 line
 to


manufacture
 them.
 And
 so
 these
 are


typically
 the
 60,000
 $100,000
 $150,000


medications.
 They
 have
 generic
 versions


called
 bioimilars.


But
 the
 FDA
 red
 tape
 to
 get
 a
 bioimilar


approved
 has
 been
 so
 long
 and
 arduous
 it


takes
 5
 to
 8
 years
 and
 $300
 million
 or


so.
 We
 have
 changed
 the
 requirements
 so


that
 we
 use
 the
 same
 principles
 we
 use


for
 small
 molecules.
 If
 you
 are


structurally
 the
 same
 as
 a
 small


molecule
 branded
 drug,
 we're
 going
 to


approve
 you
 with
 some
 other


stipulations.
 And
 so
 we
 are
 reducing
 the


cost
 of
 R&D
 of
 biosimilars
 by
 a
 hundred


million
 plus
 dollars
 and
 we
 are


shortening
 the
 time
 frame
 from
 5
 to
 8


years
 to
 2
 and
 1/2
 years
 or
 more.
 And
 so


we're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 whole
 new
 class
 of


biosimilars
 come
 out
 in
 this


administration
 that
 are
 going
 to
 finally


compete


>> with
 the
 biologics.
 Now
 humumera
 is
 one


of
 the
 most
 famous
 biologics.
 It
 took


years
 after
 that
 patent
 market


exclusivity
 for
 a
 bio
 similar
 to
 come


out
 and
 when
 one
 did
 come
 out
 you
 didn't


see
 the
 price
 of
 hum
 come
 down
 that
 much


almost
 sort
 of
 an
 an
 implied
 price


collusion.
 We
 need
 a
 lot
 of
 biosimilars


to
 come
 out
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 the


floodgates
 open
 up
 on
 biosimilars.
 And


then
 a
 final
 point,
 why
 are
 a
 lot
 of


drugs
 requiring
 a
 prescription
 in
 the


United
 States?


>> What
 are
 we
 worried
 about?
 Somebody


overdosing
 on
 anti-nausea
 medication
 or


somebody
 picking
 up
 a
 prostate


medication
 without
 a
 a
 prescription.
 And


we've
 got
 this
 is
 the
 the
 paternalism
 in


medicine
 again
 coming
 out.
 the
 same


paternalism
 that
 blocked
 women
 from


having
 home
 pregnancy
 tests
 because
 you


know
 women
 can't
 handle
 that


information.
 They
 have
 to
 come
 in
 and
 we


have
 to
 share
 it
 with
 them.
 It's
 this


paternalism
 you
 see
 and
 by
 the
 way
 it


happened
 again
 with
 COVID
 testing.
 We


saw
 it
 well
 home
 COVID
 testing.
 We


fought
 this
 battle.
 We
 wanted
 home
 COVID


testing
 and
 the
 establishment
 was
 like


no
 no
 we
 have
 to
 tell
 them
 they
 can't


have
 this
 information.


What
 are
 why
 are
 drugs
 not
 over-


theounter?
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 so
 we
 are


going
 to
 get
 more
 drugs
 over
 the


counter.
 And
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 why
 that


lowers
 drug
 prices.
 Because
 when
 a
 drug


is
 on
 the
 shelf
 in
 a
 store,
 there's
 a


price
 underneath
 of
 it.
 And
 there
 is


something
 magical
 with
 competition
 and


people
 who
 shop.
 Even
 if
 a
 small
 segment


of
 the
 consumer
 market
 is
 shopping
 on


price,
 it
 keeps
 prices
 in
 check
 for


everybody.
 And
 so
 you
 will
 enable
 price


transparency


and
 you
 will
 bypass
 the
 crazy
 money


games
 of
 PBMs,
 pharmacy
 benefit


managers.
 When
 you
 pick
 up
 something


behind
 the
 counter,
 they
 ring
 you
 up.


You
 have
 no
 idea
 the
 shell
 game
 that's


going
 on
 behind
 the
 scenes.
 Your
 with


your
 employer
 is
 getting
 ripped
 off
 and


your
 PBM
 is
 is
 making
 money
 on
 this
 and


the
 broker
 who
 sold
 the
 PBM
 to
 the


employer
 group
 could
 be
 making
 $6.50
 50


cents
 on
 every
 prescription
 set
 for


what?
 For
 the
 for
 the
 PBM
 just
 to
 tell


you
 what
 your
 co-ay
 is
 going
 to
 be
 and


set
 the
 co-pays.
 All
 of
 those
 money


games
 disappear
 with
 the
 with
 the


disinfectant
 of
 sunlight
 and
 a
 price
 on


the
 shelf.
 We
 want
 to
 see
 a
 mass


transition
 to
 more
 nonprescription


drugs.
 We
 have
 new
 leadership
 that
 I


brought
 in
 at
 the
 office
 of


non-prescription
 drugs
 at
 the
 FDA.
 We


want
 to
 see
 companies
 request
 to
 to
 be


non-prescription


and
 it
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 very
 simple


criteria.
 If
 your
 drug
 does
 not
 have


abuse
 potential,
 if
 your
 drug
 is
 safe,


if
 your
 drug
 does
 not
 require
 laboratory


testing,
 which
 doctors,
 you
 know,
 we


often
 need
 to
 check
 your
 liver
 function


tests.
 It
 does
 not
 need
 to
 be
 closely


tracked.
 It
 should
 be
 able
 to
 be
 over


the
 counter.
 If
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 use


the
 drug
 in
 some
 meth
 lab
 to
 make
 some


dangerous
 street
 drug,


if
 you
 meet
 those
 basic
 criteria,
 the


drug
 should
 be
 nonprescription.
 Think


about
 the
 number
 of
 useless
 ER
 visits


out
 there.
 Uh
 the
 whole
 medical


industrial
 complex
 ch-ing
 every
 time
 you


need
 a
 refill.
 Like
 I
 got
 pink
 eye
 from


my
 kids
 and
 it
 was
 such
 a
 headache
 to


get
 the
 drops
 to
 get
 my
 pink
 eye
 to
 go


away.
 Like
 I
 mean
 I
 can't
 I
 spent
 so


much
 money
 just
 getting
 a
 few
 drops
 of


antibiotics
 to
 put
 in
 my
 eye.
 But
 if
 I


were
 able
 to
 buy
 that
 medicine
 the


antibiotic
 drops
 over
 the
 the
 counter
 or


and
 I
 could
 just
 pick
 it
 up
 the
 shelf.


How
 do
 I
 get
 my
 insurance
 to
 pay
 for
 it?


How
 does
 that
 process
 work?
 Just
 explain


to
 the
 everyday
 consumer
 what
 that's


going
 to
 look
 like.


>> So
 we
 need
 insurance
 companies
 to
 to
 um


modernize
 how
 they
 reimburse
 for


medications.
 And
 we're
 having
 these


conversations
 internally
 as
 well
 because


they
 had
 this
 old
 construct
 of
 here's


our
 reimbursement
 scheme
 for


prescription
 drugs
 and
 here's
 our


reimbursement
 scheme
 for


non-prescription
 drugs.
 Well,
 they
 got


to
 modernize.
 We've
 got
 to
 come
 up
 to


the
 21st
 century.
 And
 remember,
 the


insurance
 companies
 own
 the
 PBMs
 a
 lot


of
 times.
 So,
 we've
 got
 to
 be
 honest.
 We


got
 to
 all
 come
 to
 the
 table.


President's
 bringing
 them
 all
 to
 the


table
 and
 having
 very
 frank


conversations.
 And
 he's
 been
 successful.


I've
 got
 to
 imagine
 at
 15%
 of
 GDP,
 this


is
 a
 giant
 ship
 you're
 trying
 to
 reset


and
 redirect.
 Can
 you
 get
 this
 done
 in


this
 administration?
 Can
 you
 make
 the


changes
 of
 moving
 many
 of
 these


medications
 over
 the
 counter
 and
 get


them
 to
 fit
 under
 insurance
 uh


reimbursement
 plans?


>> It's
 a
 massive
 priority
 this
 year
 for


me.
 My
 one
 of
 my
 big
 2026
 goals
 is
 that


we
 want
 to
 see
 more
 drugs
 move
 to


nonprescription.
 I
 if
 writing
 a


prescription
 by
 a
 physician
 like
 myself


is
 supposed
 to
 regulate
 and
 serve
 as
 a


way
 to
 administer
 drugs
 judiciously,


then
 history
 would
 show
 we
 failed.


Opioids
 and
 Oxycontton


uh
 60%
 of
 antibiotics
 prescribed
 in
 the


United
 States
 are
 unnecessary.
 That


study
 has
 been
 done
 over
 and
 over
 again


10
 different
 ways.
 Most
 antibiotics


people
 take
 they
 should
 not
 be


prescribed.
 Um,
 so
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 about


educating
 people,
 trusting
 people,
 and


get
 away
 from
 the
 paternalistic
 model
 of


medicine.


>> Yeah.
 And
 well,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 if
 you


guys
 get
 it
 done,
 I
 think it'll
 be
 a


profound
 change
 for
 America
 for
 the
 the


price
 of
 healthcare,
 which
 I
 think
 is


really
 challenging
 a
 lot
 of
 people


dayto-day.
 One
 of
 the
 other
 things


that's
 been
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 hot
 button


is
 pharmaceutical
 advertising
 on
 TV.


Yeah,


>> some
 people
 have
 claimed
 that
 the


pharmaceutical
 companies
 have


significant
 influence
 over
 media
 because


of
 the
 money
 they
 spend.
 They're
 one
 of


the
 biggest
 spenders.
 I
 spoke
 to
 a


pharmaceutical
 CEO
 about
 advertising.
 He


said
 the
 ROI
 is
 incredible.
 We've
 never


been
 able
 to
 influence
 media,
 so
 it


doesn't
 make
 a
 difference
 to
 us
 in
 that


sense,
 but
 fundamentally
 the
 reason
 we


do
 it
 is
 because
 it
 gets
 awareness
 out


there
 for
 therapies
 that
 uh
 patients


might
 not
 know
 are
 available
 to
 them.


and
 he
 said
 this
 interesting
 statistic


to
 me
 which
 is
 that
 half
 of
 US


physicians
 never
 see
 a
 representative
 to


learn
 about
 new
 uh
 drugs
 that
 are
 coming


to
 market
 and
 uh
 twothirds
 of
 physicians


report
 never
 reading
 a
 journal
 article


or
 going
 to
 a
 conference
 in
 the
 past


year.
 So
 they're
 not
 aware
 of
 some
 of


the
 new
 medicines
 that
 have
 come
 to


market
 or
 coming
 to
 market.
 You've
 been


a
 physician,
 you
 are
 a
 physician,
 you


understand
 how
 this
 might
 go.
 You're


busy.
 You're
 treating
 patients.
 You
 have


a
 lot
 going
 on.
 Maybe
 you're
 not
 up
 to


speed
 on
 on
 the
 newest
 medicines
 coming


to
 market.
 What's
 the
 administration?


What's
 your
 view
 on
 advertising,


pharmaceutical
 advertising
 on
 TV?
 Where


are
 things
 headed?


>> Well,
 raising
 awareness,
 as
 your
 uh


friend
 mentioned,
 is
 a
 good
 thing,
 but


creating
 a
 misleading
 impression
 and


creating
 a
 massive
 storm
 of
 demand
 where


patients
 come
 knocking
 on
 our
 door,


insisting
 and
 begging
 that
 they
 get


certain
 medications
 that
 are
 not


indicated
 for
 them
 is
 a
 problem.
 and
 the


drugs
 that
 they
 are
 advertising
 non-stop


on
 TV
 and
 and
 they're
 always
 singing
 and


dancing,
 right?
 Always
 singing
 and


dancing
 or
 marching
 from
 some
 fake
 town


to
 another.
 I
 don't
 know
 where
 they're


going,
 but
 it's
 always
 this
 sort
 of
 idea


that
 life
 is
 great
 once
 you
 take
 this


medication.
 Um,
 it's
 the
 biologics
 that


they're
 advertising.
 And
 because
 they


charge
 so
 much
 on
 the
 biologics,
 and


look,
 they
 do
 cost
 a
 lot
 more
 to
 make,


but
 because
 some
 of
 these
 biologics
 have


been
 so
 expensive,
 that's
 where
 they're


seeing
 this
 big
 ROI.
 So,
 we
 are
 lowering


drug
 prices,
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to


affect
 um
 whether
 or
 not
 it's
 worth
 it


for
 them
 to
 advertise.
 We
 have
 a
 duty
 at


the
 FDA
 to
 enforce
 two
 regulations
 that


were
 not
 enforced
 in
 the
 Biden


administration
 and
 that
 is
 that
 ads


cannot
 create
 a
 misleading
 impression


and
 that
 there
 has
 to
 be
 a
 quote
 unquote


fair
 balance
 of
 information.
 There's


also
 a
 loophole
 called
 the
 um


uh
 adequate
 provision
 loophole
 which


says
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 list
 all
 the


risks
 or
 side
 effects.
 You
 can
 put
 it


somewhere
 else
 like
 on
 a
 website.
 We're


closing
 that
 loop.
 We're
 changing
 the


regulation
 to
 close
 that
 loop.
 The
 Biden


folks
 in
 the
 year
 before
 I
 came
 to
 the


FDA
 sent
 out
 zero
 enforcement
 letters.
 A


department
 of
 about
 35
 people
 in
 charge


of
 sending
 out
 enforcement
 letters
 sent


out
 zero
 enforcement
 letters.
 I
 sent
 out


1,500


enforcement
 letters,
 including
 over
 a


100
 cease
 and
 desist
 letters
 for
 ads


that
 were
 creating
 a
 misleading


impression,
 including
 onlineies
 that
 are


advertising
 drugs
 without
 the
 same
 uh
 um


side
 effects
 that
 pharma
 companies
 list


when
 they
 do
 the
 ads.
 And
 so
 we
 are


cracking
 down
 on
 it.
 We
 want
 free


speech,
 but
 we
 also
 want
 fair
 speech.


And
 this
 is
 part
 of
 our
 jurisdiction.


So,
 uh,
 so
 we
 are
 taking
 this
 very


seriously.
 I
 I'd
 personally
 love
 to
 see


pharmaceutical
 companies
 spend
 that
 20


to
 25%
 of
 their
 money
 that
 they
 spend
 on


marketing,
 take
 some
 of
 that
 and
 use
 it


to
 lower
 drug
 prices
 for
 everyday


Americans.


>> Okay,
 great.
 Well,
 sounds
 like
 there's


some
 balance
 and
 change
 that's
 required.


One
 of
 the
 other
 things
 that
 we
 talk
 a


lot
 about
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 is
 this


shift
 in
 AI
 and
 using
 AI
 to
 diagnose


your
 condition.
 And
 so
 many
 stories
 have


come
 out
 where
 people
 upload
 their
 lab


data
 or
 an
 MRI
 image
 and
 they're
 getting


readouts
 that
 they
 weren't
 getting
 from


the
 doctor
 or
 more
 accurate
 readouts
 or


they're
 able
 to
 find
 care
 that
 they


weren't
 finding
 through
 the
 traditional


physician
 process.
 What's
 this


administration's
 view
 on
 these
 AI
 tools?


Are
 they
 a
 supplement,
 a
 replacement?


And
 then
 how
 do
 we
 allow
 them
 to


proliferate
 if
 they're
 they're
 good?
 And


do
 they
 need
 to
 be
 regulated?
 or
 are
 we


going
 to
 end
 up
 regulating
 these
 AI


doctors,
 these
 AI
 medical
 systems?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 AI
 is
 producing


information
 at
 a
 rate
 that
 no
 one
 can


keep
 up
 with.
 And
 so,
 if
 we
 use
 the


traditional
 regulatory
 mindset
 to
 say
 we


have
 to
 make
 sure
 the
 information
 is


accurate,
 then
 you
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to


do
 a
 Google
 search
 because
 you're
 going


to
 get
 a
 hit
 that's
 going
 to
 give
 you


something
 that's
 not
 accurate.
 And
 so,


what
 are
 we
 doing?
 What
 road
 are
 we


going
 down?
 We
 can't
 outrun
 this
 lion.


We
 have
 to
 use
 common
 sense
 and


demarcate
 information
 that
 you're


getting
 from
 AI
 that
 automatically


triggers
 some
 health
 intervention
 that


is
 sort
 of
 automated
 AI.
 And
 so
 last


week
 at
 the
 Consumer
 Electronic
 Show,
 I


outlined
 new
 guidances
 on
 AI
 decision


support
 and
 wearables.
 And
 it
 creates
 a


a
 clear
 consumer
 lane.
 But
 if
 you're


making
 medical
 claims
 of
 a
 uh
 medicalra


blank,
 then
 that's
 something
 we're
 going


to
 want
 to
 take
 a
 look
 at
 and
 that's


something
 you're
 going
 to
 want
 the
 FDA's


seal
 about.
 So,
 it
 creates


predictability
 because
 developers
 tell


me
 all
 the
 time
 they
 just
 want


predictability
 from
 the
 FDA.
 Markets


want
 predictability,
 developers
 want


predictability,
 and
 investors
 want


predictability.
 So
 wearables
 meaning


heart
 rate,
 blood
 pressure,
 that's


right.
 Glucose
 monitors,
 those
 sorts
 of


things
 get
 deregulated,
 more
 accessible,


lower
 price,
 and
 so
 on.


>> That's
 right.
 They're
 going
 to
 be


deregulated.
 So
 you
 can
 give
 those


results
 of
 any
 physiologic
 parameter.


But
 if
 you
 say
 that
 it's
 a
 quote
 unquote


medical
 grade
 blood
 pressure,
 then
 we


are
 going
 to
 want
 to
 see
 the
 data
 to


make
 sure
 that
 it's
 validated
 with
 the


gold
 standard
 blood
 pressure
 readings.


We
 don't
 want
 people
 redosing
 their


blood
 pressure
 medications
 on
 something


that
 claims
 to
 be
 medical
 grade
 when
 it


it
 is
 not
 medical
 grade.


>> Got
 it.
 Okay.
 One
 other
 area
 I've
 spent


some
 time
 in
 in
 my
 career
 is
 in


alternative
 proteins.
 And
 this
 is


something
 that
 your
 agency
 regulates.
 So


making
 animal
 proteins,
 eggs
 and
 cheese


and
 milk
 and
 so
 on
 using
 bacterial
 or


yeast
 cells
 rather
 than
 making
 them
 from


the
 animal.
 You
 get
 the
 same
 protein.


and
 you
 just
 use
 a
 different
 mechanism


of
 making
 that
 protein
 or
 cellular
 meat


where
 they're
 actually
 growing
 the


chicken
 breast
 or
 growing
 the
 the
 beef.


Um
 there's
 historically
 been
 a
 system


called
 grass
 are
 generally
 recognized
 as


safe
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 companies
 have


relied
 on
 as
 they've
 developed
 these


techniques
 and
 these
 protocols.
 You've


made
 a
 few
 changes.
 Maybe
 you
 can
 kind


of
 highlight
 the
 balance
 between


innovation
 because
 the
 benefit
 of
 these


systems,
 lower
 cost,
 less
 energy,
 and


you
 take
 the
 animal
 out,
 less
 cruelty.


There's
 an
 ethical
 driver
 for
 some
 of


us.


>> Yes.


>> But
 I'd
 love
 to
 hear
 the
 view
 on


balancing
 those
 benefits
 against
 the
 the


risks
 to
 consumer
 health.
 And
 there's
 an


incredible
 amount
 of
 lobbying
 pressure


from
 ranchers
 and
 animal
 agriculture


against
 these
 systems
 that
 I'm
 assuming


is
 starting
 to
 kind
 of
 make
 its
 way
 into


DC.
 we've
 seen
 it
 make
 its
 way
 into


states
 where
 they've
 banned
 it
 outright


banned
 cellular
 meat
 in
 some
 states.
 So,


I'd
 love
 to
 hear
 your
 view
 on
 this
 kind


of
 alternative
 protein
 market
 and
 the


changes
 you've
 made
 in
 grass
 and
 and


looking
 out
 for
 consumers
 against
 the


benefits.


>> Um,
 you're
 making
 me
 hungry
 because
 I


love
 eggs
 and
 I
 didn't
 get
 my
 egg


breakfast
 this
 morning
 because
 we're
 out


here
 at
 a
 bunch
 of
 meetings.


>> But,
 um,


>> I'll
 get
 you
 some
 eggs
 afterwards.


>> Great.
 And
 not
 egg
 white
 only.
 I
 I
 do


not
 believe
 in
 egg
 white
 only.
 I
 mean


that
 is
 what
 are
 we
 doing?
 Egg
 white


only
 eggs.
 I
 mean
 that's
 sort
 of
 the


ultimate
 epitome
 of
 the
 old
 dogma.
 Um


and
 and
 by
 the
 way
 my
 uncle
 um
 he
 came


to
 the
 United
 States.
 He
 had
 eaten
 eggs


every
 morning
 and
 he
 loved
 eggs.
 It
 was


his
 livelihood
 is
 the
 morning
 eggs.
 And


he
 came
 to
 the
 United
 States
 in
 his
 30s


and
 his
 doctor
 said
 no
 eggs.
 You
 know


found
 out
 he
 was
 eating
 eggs
 and
 just


you
 know
 wagged
 the
 finger
 and
 you
 know


stopped.
 And
 so
 for
 30ome
 years,
 he
 had


this
 miserable
 life
 without
 eggs
 until


we
 finally
 got
 to
 him
 and
 said,
 "It's


okay.
 Two
 eggs
 in
 the
 morning
 is
 okay.


It's
 a
 good
 source
 of
 protein.
 Don't


worry
 about
 the
 saturated
 fat."
 He's
 now


95
 years
 old,
 I
 believe,
 in
 Florida.


>> A
 happy
 man.


>> Happy
 man
 eating
 his
 eggs
 every
 morning.


>> I'm
 a
 two
 to
 three
 egg
 a
 guy
 as
 well.
 So


>> Oh,
 you
 are?
 Okay.
 It's
 a
 great
 source


of
 protein.
 Yeah.
 So
 um
 on
 grass,
 so


grass
 uh
 for
 those
 who
 may
 not
 know
 is
 a


way
 in
 which
 companies
 have
 created


chemicals
 or
 brought
 in
 chemicals
 from


the
 environment,
 added
 it
 to
 food
 and


they
 could
 self-declare
 them
 as
 safe.


And
 so
 u
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 unique
 thing
 in


the
 United
 States
 and
 it
 was
 started


with
 good
 intentions
 so
 that
 the
 FDA


wouldn't
 regulate
 you
 know
 salt
 and


butter.
 You
 know
 what
 are
 we
 doing


regulating
 salt?
 I'm
 sure
 some
 people


want
 may
 want
 to,
 but
 we're,
 you
 know,


we're
 not
 going
 to
 regulate
 salt.
 So,


grass
 was
 created
 for
 for
 those
 sort
 of


things
 like
 salt,
 but
 then
 over
 time
 it


got
 abused.
 So,
 all
 the
 of
 these


engineered
 chemicals


would
 just
 get
 a
 free
 pass.
 And
 we've


said,
 look
 at
 where
 we
 are
 today.
 Uh,


you
 turn
 over
 the
 packaging
 of
 some
 of


these
 ultrarocessed
 foods
 and
 there's
 40


ingredients.
 Nobody
 knows
 what
 they
 are.


And
 uh
 in
 Europe
 they
 have
 basic


principles
 of
 introducing
 chemicals.


Basically
 it's
 it's
 sort
 of
 if
 you
 will


uh
 guilty
 until
 proven
 innocent
 that
 is


you
 have
 to
 demonstrate
 safety
 to
 be


introduced.
 In
 the
 United
 States
 we
 have


this
 you
 know
 uh
 innocent
 till
 proven


guilty.
 So
 we
 have
 basically
 said
 we


have
 a
 thousand
 chemicals
 plus
 in
 the
 US


food
 supply
 that
 do
 are
 not
 allowed
 in


other
 food
 supplies.


Froot
 Loops
 was
 making
 cereal
 for
 Canada


where
 the
 petroleum
 based
 diets
 were


banned
 and
 a
 different
 Froot
 Loops
 for


the
 United
 States
 for
 American
 kids.
 And


so
 we've
 said
 we
 have
 to
 close
 the


loophole
 on
 grass.
 We
 started
 the


regulatory
 process
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 then


we
 have
 to
 think
 about
 creatively
 those


situations
 you
 mentioned
 where
 there
 may


be
 ways
 to
 get
 more
 amino
 acids
 in
 some


of
 these
 foods.
 And
 we
 know
 that
 kids


are
 low
 in
 amino
 acids
 and
 protein


because
 of
 this
 myopic
 focus
 on
 fat
 as


the
 boogeyman.
 We
 have
 not
 gotten
 the


protein
 that
 we
 need.
 And
 and
 part
 of


that
 was
 also
 flawed
 studies


approximating
 how
 much
 protein
 your
 body


needed
 that
 used
 ura
 nitrogen
 levels


that
 massively
 underestimated
 the
 amount


of
 protein
 metabolism
 in
 your
 body.
 And


every
 food
 has
 different
 levels
 of


protein
 bioavailability
 and
 amino
 acid


bioavailability.
 So
 that's
 why
 you
 said


you're
 vegetarian.
 you
 have
 to
 think
 a


little
 differently
 about
 the
 protein


requirements.
 Uh
 so
 all
 fun
 top


>> but
 the
 cellular
 meat
 industry
 you
 don't


think
 is
 doomed.
 There's
 a
 potential
 for


the
 industry
 and


>> it's
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 evolve.


>> We've
 seen
 under
 my
 time
 at
 FDA
 we've


seen
 new
 cellular
 uh
 food
 products
 come


not
 just
 beef
 but
 seafood.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it
 happens
 at
 the
 state
 level
 and


the
 FDA
 actually
 does
 not
 have


jurisdiction
 over
 what
 somebody
 creates


but
 we
 do
 ask
 for
 a
 registration
 in
 a


sense
 to
 be
 in
 the
 loop.


>> Okay.
 So
 what
 is
 causing
 autism
 in
 the


United
 States?


>> Yeah,


>> there
 was
 a
 conference
 a
 few
 weeks
 ago.


You
 and
 um
 Secretary
 Kennedy
 talked


about
 Luca
 Vorin
 as
 a
 new
 line
 of


treatment
 for
 autism
 patients,
 but
 some


people
 have
 since
 debated
 the
 merits
 of


the
 data.
 Are
 we
 seeing
 rising
 autism


rates
 in
 the
 United
 States?
 And
 what
 are


the
 core
 drivers?
 What
 have
 you
 learned?


And
 is
 this
 an
 ongoing
 process?


>> Well,
 there
 is
 more
 diagnosis
 for
 sure.


Um,
 but
 one
 in
 12
 boys
 in
 California
 now


being
 diagnosed
 with
 autism.
 I
 mean,


that
 you
 you
 didn't
 see
 that
 two


generations
 ago.
 You
 didn't
 see
 the


repetitive
 ticks
 and
 the
 self
 harm
 and


the
 you
 didn't
 see
 that.
 You
 still
 don't


see
 people
 in
 their
 60s
 and
 70s
 with


those
 uh
 symptoms
 at
 the
 rates
 that
 you


do
 in
 young
 kids
 today.
 So,
 something's


going
 on
 for
 sure.
 Now,
 what's
 causing


it?
 I
 don't
 know,
 but
 there's
 some


interesting
 hypotheses.
 One
 is
 that
 for


some
 kids
 it
 may
 be
 an
 autoimmune


phenomena
 triggered
 by
 something
 where


the
 antibodies
 are
 binding
 to
 the
 folate


receptors
 preventing
 folate
 from


entering
 the
 bloodb
 brain
 barrier.


Folate
 is
 necessary
 for
 neural


development.
 And
 so
 some
 doctors
 report


and
 they're
 I
 mean
 these
 are
 experts
 in


the
 field
 been
 studying
 this
 their
 whole


lives
 and
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 patients.
 They


have
 observed
 that
 if
 you
 give


f
 um
 lucavorin
 as
 an
 example
 which


bypasses
 the
 blocked
 receptor
 allowing


methylated
 folate
 to
 get
 into
 the
 bloodb


brain
 barrier
 they
 have
 seen
 clinical


improvement.
 There's
 one
 study
 that's


looked
 at
 the
 microbiome
 which
 we
 now


know
 produces
 a
 lot
 of
 molecules


involved
 in
 brain
 health.
 90%
 of
 your


body's
 serotonin
 which
 is
 involved
 in


mood
 is
 made
 by
 your
 gut.
 And
 we're
 just


recognizing
 this
 giant
 frontier
 of
 the


microbiome.
 And
 so
 when
 we
 in
 the
 modern


world,
 we
 we
 just
 torture
 the


microbiome.
 I
 mean,
 so
 many
 things.


>> Some
 things
 are
 necessary
 like


C-sections,
 not
 good
 for
 the
 microbiome.


Uh
 infant
 formula
 instead
 of
 breast


milk,
 not
 good
 for
 the
 microbiome.
 Um


antibiotics
 used
 like
 candy.
 The
 average


2-year-old
 has
 already
 received
 over
 2.5


courses
 of
 antibiotics.
 It's
 carpet


bombing
 your
 microbiome
 in
 certain


places.
 And
 what
 results
 is
 bacterial


overgrowth,
 less
 biodiversity,
 and
 you


have
 more
 inflammation
 later
 in
 life.


And
 when
 you
 have
 inflammation
 of
 the


gut,
 most
 the
 most
 painful
 thing
 in


medicine
 is
 when
 a
 tubular
 structure


stretches.


A
 kidney
 stone
 supposedly
 is
 the
 most


painful
 thing.
 I've
 never
 had
 one.


Patients
 say
 it
 is.
 It's
 not
 it's
 not


the
 stone
 scraping
 along
 the
 lumen.
 It


is
 the
 blockage
 causing
 distension


proximally
 stretching
 the
 urer
 that's


what
 hurts
 gallbladder
 pain
 stretching


the
 gallbladder
 that's
 what
 hurts
 like


crazy
 and
 the
 GI
 tract
 with
 low
 levels


of
 inflammation
 is
 irritating
 that
 lumen


and
 also
 causing
 this
 sort
 of
 um


discomfort
 at
 a
 low
 level
 and
 and
 for
 a


kid
 it
 may
 manifest
 as
 feeling
 sad
 or


depressed
 and
 so
 we
 give
 kids
 all
 these


chemicals
 and
 ultrarocessed
 foods.
 We


alter
 their
 microbiome


and
 we
 change
 the
 production
 of
 what


comes
 out
 of
 the
 microbiome
 cells


normally.
 That
 is
 certain
 vitamins,
 um,


hormone
 regulation,
 serotonin.
 And
 what


are
 we
 doing?
 We're
 ignoring
 this


physiologic
 cause
 and
 we're
 drugging
 our


nation's
 kids
 at
 scale.


>> So,
 we've
 got
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 value
 of


mic
 the
 microbiome.
 And
 I
 would
 not
 be


surprised
 if
 we
 had
 the
 research
 on
 that


instead
 of
 just
 the
 DEI
 stuff
 we
 talked


about
 and
 study
 the
 microbiome
 the
 same


way
 we
 were
 funding
 the
 Wuhan
 lab
 to


study
 corona
 virus
 you
 know


manipulation.
 I
 think
 we
 could
 finally


understand


this
 great
 frontier
 of
 medicine
 that
 may


be
 involved
 in
 autism.
 One
 study
 has


found
 that
 if
 you
 give
 a
 certain


protease


it
 can
 it's
 a
 randomized
 trial.
 I


couldn't
 believe
 it
 when
 I
 saw
 it


because
 and
 you
 know
 sometimes
 the


studies
 are
 not
 reproducible
 in
 JAMAMA


our
 most
 widely
 circulated
 medical


journal
 a
 randomized
 trial
 giving
 a


protease
 to
 kids
 with
 autism
 and


noticing
 a
 an
 improvement
 now
 again
 it


needs
 to
 be
 replicated
 I
 don't
 know
 if


it's
 real
 but
 maybe
 there's
 something
 to


the
 microbiome
 so
 I
 don't
 know
 what


causes
 autism
 but
 we
 have
 some
 clues
 and


this
 is
 something
 worth
 studying
 not


just
 is
 there
 a
 genetic
 cure
 for
 autism.


>> Yeah.
 And
 the
 underlying
 environmental


contributors,
 there's
 just
 so
 much
 going


on
 that's
 different
 in
 our
 environment,


in
 our
 food
 system
 that
 are
 also
 being


addressed
 that
 over
 time
 hopefully
 will


result
 in
 maybe
 less
 of
 the
 general


health
 effects
 caused
 by
 call
 it
 an


adverse
 environment.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 there
 the
 number
 of


proteins
 that
 we
 ingest
 that
 are


denatured
 in
 some
 way.
 The
 number
 of


chemicals
 or
 molecules
 that
 do
 not


appear
 in
 nature
 that
 go
 down
 the
 GI


tract.
 What's
 happening
 is
 you're


getting
 an
 inflammatory
 response,
 but


it's
 not
 a
 sudden
 acute
 inflammatory


response.
 It's
 a
 low-grade
 response
 and


it
 may
 be
 causing
 general
 body


inflammation.
 And
 the
 one
 thing
 I
 wish
 I


would
 have
 learned
 in
 medical
 school
 is


that
 most
 chronic
 diseases
 are
 from


general
 body
 inflammation
 and
 insulin


resistance.
 Heart
 disease,
 for
 example,


most
 common
 cause
 of
 death
 in
 the
 United


States.
 We
 thought
 it
 was
 just
 saturated


fat.
 Three
 large
 studies
 failed
 to
 show


that
 association.
 The
 Minnesota
 heart


study
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 the
 endall


randomized
 trial
 in
 the
 1960s.


It
 showed
 the
 opposite
 of
 what
 they


thought.
 The
 low-fat
 diet
 group,
 this


these
 are
 9,000
 motans
 randomized.


Low-fat
 group
 had
 more
 heart
 attacks,


not
 less.


>> They
 suppressed
 the
 results
 for
 16


years.
 When
 Gary
 Tobs
 asked
 the
 uh
 the


senior
 author
 before
 he
 died,
 why
 didn't


you
 publish
 this
 for
 16
 years?
 He
 said,


we
 just
 the
 results
 just
 didn't
 turn
 out


the
 way
 we
 expected.


>> Well,
 other
 large
 studies
 failed
 to
 find


this
 clear
 association
 between
 saturated


fat.
 We're
 talking
 about
 normal


saturated
 fat
 intake,
 not
 massive


overdosing.
 Normal
 saturated
 fat
 and


heart
 disease.
 And
 so
 um
 uh
 so
 anyway,


so
 there
 are
 these
 things
 that
 we
 have


to
 re-evaluate.


>> Okay,
 last
 question.
 What's
 most


exciting
 to
 you
 in
 the
 frontiers
 of


science
 in
 human
 health?


>> You
 know,
 we
 at
 the
 FDA
 try
 to
 be


referees.
 So
 we
 see
 um
 different


technologies
 competing.
 For
 example,


cickle
 cell
 disease.
 There
 are
 monoconal


antibbody
 treatments
 and
 there
 are
 gene


therapy
 treatments.
 Now,
 we
 tend
 to
 get


excited
 about
 one
 over
 another,
 but
 the


reality
 is
 we
 we
 don't
 know
 which
 horse


is
 going
 to
 win
 that
 race
 and
 so
 we
 want


to
 be
 the
 referees.
 I
 would
 like
 to
 see


in
 the
 Trump
 administration
 during
 our


term
 a
 cure
 for
 type
 1
 diabetes
 or
 some


meaningful
 treatment
 for
 type
 1


diabetes.
 Uh
 a
 powerful
 treatment
 for


ALS.


um
 treatments
 for
 certain
 kinds
 of


cancer
 where
 we've
 seen
 now
 PD1
 blockers


and
 K
 Rass
 inhibitors
 melt
 the
 tumors


away
 so
 you
 don't
 need
 surgery
 or
 chemo.


You
 talk
 about
 a
 health
 reform,
 that's


that's
 more
 powerful
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 the


health
 reform
 ideas
 we
 have
 out
 there.


You
 don't
 need
 surgery
 or
 chemo
 or


radiation.
 I
 mean,
 think
 about
 the


reduction
 in
 expenditures.
 Um
 we'd
 like


to
 see
 a
 universal
 flu
 shot
 so
 we're
 not


guessing
 every
 year.
 something
 that


gives
 you
 lifelong
 protection
 against


future
 strains
 because
 it
 targets
 a


different
 part
 of
 the
 influenza
 virus.


And
 I
 would
 like
 to
 see
 something


powerful
 for
 PTSD.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of


Americans
 are
 still
 suffering
 from
 PTSD,


some
 from
 having
 served
 in
 a
 war.
 Uh,


these
 are
 young
 people
 oftentimes
 who


stood
 up
 to
 serve
 their
 country
 and,
 uh,


they
 are
 suffering.
 uh
 we
 are
 still


losing
 7,000
 plus
 uh
 veterans
 a
 year
 to


suicide.
 So
 the
 wars
 are
 over,
 but
 our


men
 and
 women
 keep
 dying
 and
 many
 of


these
 wars
 were
 unnecessary.


>> I
 think
 we
 owe
 it
 to
 them
 to
 deliver
 a


powerful
 treatment
 for
 PTSD
 if
 the
 data


supports
 that
 there's
 something
 out


there.
 So
 that's
 one
 of
 my
 personal


goals.


>> You're
 optimistic
 about
 the
 pipeline


you're
 seeing
 there?


>> Very
 optimistic.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 just


seeing
 really
 interesting
 stuff.
 It's


been
 published
 in
 part,
 so
 I'm
 not


sharing
 anything
 here
 that's
 not
 public,


but
 we've
 seen
 phase
 two
 trial
 results


that
 are
 promising.
 And
 I
 go,
 you
 know,


I
 go
 Dave
 to
 the
 re
 scientific
 reviewers


at
 the
 FDA.


>> Yeah.


>> Without
 their
 bosses,
 just
 one-on-one,


and
 I
 ask
 them,
 are
 you
 seeing
 anything


early
 on
 that
 looks
 amazing?
 Are
 you


seeing
 anything
 in
 the
 pipeline,


anything
 in
 animal
 studies
 that's


actually
 working
 in
 animals
 that
 could


extrapolate
 to
 humans
 in
 a
 way
 that


could
 be
 a
 gamecher?


And
 I'd
 say
 90%
 of
 the
 time
 they
 say


nothing
 really
 that
 much
 of
 a
 leap.
 We


do
 a
 lot
 of
 non-inferiority
 studies,
 for


example,
 but
 every
 now
 and
 then
 somebody


will
 tell
 me,
 "Yeah,
 there's
 this


mechanism.
 It's
 creative.
 It's


different.
 And
 if
 it
 works,
 it'll
 be


amazing."
 and
 we'll
 often
 issue
 that


company
 a
 priority
 voucher.


>> Um,
 a
 treatment
 came
 out
 for
 a
 certain


type
 of
 congenital
 deafness.
 It's
 a
 gene


therapy
 device
 combination.
 It
 came
 out


in
 the
 New
 England
 Journal
 of
 Medicine.


We
 read
 the
 article
 because
 we
 love
 to


read
 these
 articles.
 That's
 our
 nature.


And
 we
 called
 the
 company
 and
 we


confirmed
 about
 a
 dozen
 kids
 got
 it.
 A


couple
 had
 normal
 hearing.
 I
 mean,


that's
 amazing.
 And
 so
 we
 immediately


issued
 them
 a
 voucher.
 a
 new
 treatment


for
 multiple
 myoma
 that
 was
 a
 gamecher.


Three
 times
 better
 than
 anything
 out


there
 now.
 Uh
 80%
 remission
 free


survival
 I
 believe
 it
 was
 uh
 at
 a
 couple


years
 out.
 There's
 nothing
 like
 that
 on


the
 market.
 We
 called
 that
 company.
 We


had
 internal
 discussions
 within
 24
 hours


of
 that
 abstract
 being
 printed
 in
 the


pre-conference
 materials
 for
 the


American
 Society
 of
 Hematology.
 We
 had


been
 in
 touch
 with
 that
 company
 and


issued
 them
 a
 voucher.
 What
 are
 we


waiting
 for?
 Right?
 What
 are
 we
 worried


about?
 We
 have
 got
 to
 move
 at
 the
 speed


that
 my
 patients
 demanded,
 not
 at


government
 speed.
 So,
 we
 are


streamlining
 and
 modernizing
 the
 FDA.


And
 we
 are
 not
 wasting
 time.
 We're


getting
 stuff
 done.


>> Well,
 for
 that,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 anyone


could
 disagree
 with
 the
 sentiment,
 the


intent.
 Thanks
 for
 the
 service.
 Thanks


for
 the
 work,
 Marty.
 It's
 been
 great


chatting
 today
 and
 thanks
 for
 being
 with


me.


>> Great
 to
 be
 with
 you,
 Dave.
 Thanks
 so


much.


I'm
 going
 all
 in.
