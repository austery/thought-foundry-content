We recently listened to a podcast This was my favourite podcast of all time. Some of the things he says today have just created these like personal revelations in my head where I genuinely feel that I have to go and sit down in a room alone and think about them for the next couple of weeks, genuinely life-changing. And you've never heard me this enthusiastic on the podcast. So if you're ever gonna trust me with an episode, trust me on this one. 他让我们突然就懂了自己为什么不开心还有怎么样变得开心其实简单到只需要8秒钟不仅如此他还帮我们解答了很多生活当中的疑惑就比如说为什么英文学了这么多年还是不敢开口怎么样在生气愤怒的时候控制自己的情绪还有怎么样在遭受不公的待遇不幸的时候如何重拾生活的勇气 等等一系列的這種問題這期播客剛好是英文所以我們就打算做一期聽播客學英文我們不會拆分這些句子去教英文而是想用這些英文的內容去探索生活思考然後獲得一些成長希望英文可以成為我們通向自我察覺的一扇門接下來我們會簡單介紹一下這位嘉賓 整理一下这期播客当中的重点并且分享一些让我们能够感同身受触发很多共鸣的受益的东西对希望这支影片能够激起你去听这期播客的兴趣反正非常有钱很聪明在二十多岁就已经实现财富自由随随便便就能够挣到钱他自己说他把钱视为印钞一般简单我非常成功 我非常成功,我可以在需求上印錢我和太太有時會說我們可以換車嗎?我會說,你喜歡什麼?她會說這個我會說,等到星期天我會在貨幣市場上做幾天的貿易後來就成了Google X然後Microsoft真的用巨頭網絡公司的各種部門的主管往返於美國跟中東之間 Later, the turning point in her life was her son's continuous food loss during the surgery. She had a small interaction with her daughter. That day she still wanted to focus on work. She talked to her daughter. at her slowly raising my head in grumpiness and said, "Can we please be serious for a minute?" Okay? What serious? She was five. and I could see with my own eyes as my daughter's, beautiful daughter's heart broke. Okay? And I think to me that was basically the moment where I said I can't live with this person anymore. Let him think about whether the meaning of my life is really in what I want to do. 還是說我搞錯了方向這個之後呢他就開始去寫書去探索幸福的定義到底是怎樣的我覺得這個人最特別的地方是在於他探討的這個話題其實是非常感性的就開心不開心這個話題但他所用的這個工具呢很多時候又是非常理性的分析這種方式這裡又存在一種碰撞 就讓他講出來這個東西非常不一樣很理性告訴你應該在這你一般會覺得我怎麼可能做得到但是你聽他的話你說原來是這樣子我可以試試看這是能夠以很簡單的方式把一些很複雜的感性問題講得非常的清楚這是我 我極其佩服他的一點也是我覺得大家學英文的時候其實可以去接觸一下那些非英語母語的人怎麼樣把一個問題能夠講得清楚因為他用的詞也沒有說很大很難或者講很簡單的表達但是能夠直接觸及你的內心我覺得這才是真的表達力很厲害的人而不是說你表達有多麼的母語或者怎樣真的不要讓這個扭曲了你學英文的方向 因为要回答开不开心这个问题其实定义非常重要他里面在讲到不开心的时候又讲到一个不开心的极端就是depression describe it as they cut your head off and fill you with concrete when you're depressed. 你无法做任何事情,你无法享受任何事情,你无法参与我觉得所有的事情都是错的所有人都在跟你作对,看什么东西都不爽我自己个人只有一个特别深刻的感触有一段时间就是当时我因为打篮球所以这是我发生的 It's just a random day, I was routinely going through my day per usual, it just happened. The moment I collapsed, I couldn't see anything, I kind of blacked out for a sec. When I came back to conscious, I knew immediately what that was. 在一年內我下降了跟腱斷裂了做了手術在家裡面你哪裡都去不了你就躺在家裡面腦袋一直在想各種各樣的東西為什麼會受傷是什麼原因是不是因為那段時間我去健身房加了太多體重還是因為那天我沒熱身還嘟嘟叭叭叭各種腦生活在憤怒當中我正在想 Given everything I've been through last year, I don't deserve that. Wipe the f**k up...那一整段時間我覺得我父母是對我不好我朋友是對我不好我看誰都不爽我看所有的事情都不爽現在再看到他的形容我覺得當時的我 就是一個水泥人可是現在回頭去看你說當時真的沒有人對我好嗎沒有人有對我有任何的善意嗎所以根本就不是這樣子只是我自己選擇放了一個很好的圖片所以我看到的所有東西透過這個圖片都是很好的以你的意見我把這篇文章翻得太快了我沒有自己能夠 feel and handle my emotions, which a little late said. I didn't know how to feel about it, what to do with it. And to make matters even worse, my Achilles injury isn't just a physical setback. It actually signifies the end of my years in Australia. I didn't know what Australia means to me and I have no idea what I experienced in Australia mean to me, what the people that I met in Australia mean to me. It turns out they mean a lot more than I thought. It was only when I got off the plane I understood what a big significance they carry. On my ride to the hospital I said to my parents I want to go back. My mom looked at me puzzled. She was like, "You're back for like remind me how long?" 30 minutes and now you're saying you want to go back You've got to be kidding me But I wasn't kidding I cried the shit out of it that night Lived like a dead man the weeks after So this definition actually made me feel deeply moved I shared a word It was a raw word to me before But I feel that after listening to this blog I may remember it for the rest of my life Instant radical acceptance These three words are very meaningful to my life at different stages Like you separate the word "acceptance" and "接纳" Since I was 28, I've been through some challenges in my life For example, my favorite family died And my favorite cat died too At this time, I might I think through these big trauma events Brings me a very important ability Acceptance Because I found that you have no choice but to accept everything you are facing in your life And then as to why radical acceptance is complete I also experienced some things later Because he knows that I am actually interested in spirituality Because I found that in the flood of life You only have to learn to fully accept the arrangements of life for you Or the arrangement of fate You can slowly become yourself I think it's more comfortable As for instant I think these three Although they are separate words But when combined together It really becomes a skill that I can keep learning Why is it instant After I was with him In the relationship of two sexes Explore in close relationship You want both of them to... How to say it? Because everyone has a lot of points to work on There will be a lot of conflicts At this time, if you have an instant In fact, in Chinese, it is the ability to quickly flip the page Then the two of them will really avoid a lot of cold battles and quarrels Actually, I think this skill is also very emotional to me Me and him Now the time for cold war or quarrel will be much shorter It used to be a cold war period of one day, two days, three days Now it has become a morning or afternoon Now it has become a few seconds This is really through this episode of watching the dream Let me, that is, he gave me such a A need to practice for my life 技能的總結吧,就是這三個單詞instant radical acceptance所以Mohd他裡面有講到他說我要教別人變得更加的開心那我自己最好是你不可以在這方面爭吵,但我會說是為了鼓勵別人如果我能夠教人們快樂的話我必須成為運動的奧運會冠軍我保證你,我不會在這方面爭吵我一般來說,我需要7秒 From the time my brain suggests that something deserves my happiness, to the time I either dismiss it because it's not true, or decide what I'm going to do about it, or decide to accept it and think what else I'm going to do is 7 seconds. 7 seconds, okay? Yes, sometimes I get stuck in, you know, maybe 3-4 times a year, I get stuck in something that takes me, you know, a day to overcome. 但通常是一個很簡單的流程圖,是一個很理想的方式這個其實真的非常難做我覺得作為聽眾而言,或者觀眾而言你在看的時候,你可能會覺得阿哈利跟他講,道理我都懂啊當事情真的發生的時候,非常非常的困難 就這樣我當時更間斷的時候,你跟我說,啊,講這些東西你要從裡面走出來我不懂嗎?懂嗎?但我不願意接受好多時候人並不一定是真的想要開心我們更想要的是,I want to have my pain validated, it's not me It's the world好多時候其實內心都不是說我想要變得更開心是我想要保留這種不開心的權利因為一旦承認說我需要為這件事情負責我的生活是我自己的那你就必須要放棄 你说是世界部对我不公是这些人做错的事情这是非常难的也是为什么在这期播客当中说当你说幸福是一种选择或开心是一种选择的时候你就失去了80%的观众了我不知道现在是不是只留下20%的人了那个Steven 这位主持人他里面提到说你知道我为什么知道吗因为我有一天做了一条推特我的推特是 There's like a kind of mental model, but there's a reframing that can I think has brought me happiness, which is when something happens to me, I used to like many people say, X thing that happened has pissed me off. Yeah. And just by changing that sentence to I've pissed myself off because of X thing. Absolutely. And I tweeted that I was like, try it just like reframe it and take personal responsibility for how you're feeling. feeling. And in the comments section, everyone was like, 不,人們不喜歡他們有控制自己的情緒說白了我應該有這個權利去選擇不開心我覺得對然後你現在有一段是曲觀風凱文我覺得對,我當時我跟正在我也有這個權利去選擇不開心大家每個人在經歷這種事情你都有權利去選擇不開心但是到最後就是這是你自己的生活 They won't take the responsibility for you I think when that moment happens You will realize that I have been choosing to be unhappy for such a long time There is also a story about Mo when she was in a speech She was a grandma She was probably 60 or 70 years old One day one of them comes to me in the first break and says What are you talking about? What do you mean happiness is a choice? You have no idea what happened to me Okay, and I said, okay, and she said when I was 17, she was 74 at the time. Can you believe that? 57 years of holding on to one thought hitting her head against the wall. 然後說他們就是擁抱了奶奶嘛然後就都哭了對啊,對,不值得,但是要做出改變非常困難怎麼樣去做呢?播客當中其實有具體介紹幾個步驟其實是我想要分享另外一個點但我在上期視頻當中也講過所以我就快點帶過 我們有些時候會覺得自己腦子當中跟自己講話的那個聲音就是你自己但其實不是當我告訴我自己說上天不公,所有人對我都不好我就覺得大家真的對我都不好跟他們官隊全部都處不好 但是如果你能夠意識到這個聲音它可能並不一定是你自己因為如果這個聲音就是你自己的話那為什麼要有這個聲音?為什麼要有這個時間差?你為什麼需要這個聲音告訴你?然後你再去做件事情呢?如果它是你的話你根本就不需要它告訴你你就直接 有這個想法就已經在做這個事情了呀所以這就不make sense所以Moe他解釋事情的一種邏輯方式真的無限可及再次respect Moe對,所以一下就明白噢,這個聲音,它可能是另外的聲音然後Moe給他自己的大腦取了一個名字叫Blackie Helie給自己大家取的名字叫鋤頭我給自己大家取的名字叫洞裡鋤頭跟洞裡都是我們家那隻很瘋狂很瘋的狗我就想說Poe一個洞裡的就感覺她腦子有點不好我感覺我自己腦子不好的時候我就想她可能她在告訴我這些聲音並不是我自己那你開始質疑自己腦子這個聲音並不是真實的你的想法你就有了改變的空間了因為並不是我們想的那樣 所以我这里我给大家推荐有本书叫You are not everything that you think很短很短的一本书真的非常非常的棒我想讲的这个点是其实我是想跟屏幕前的所有所有的女生女性讲的也是最后主持人问的某的一个问题他说你What are the failures you cherish the most? 我失敗了他講了一段話 我真的覺得看得當時我跟你說 我哭死了我沒想到我看一期Podcast 我都哭成那樣對 當時他在看這一Podcast 我也在看然後我差不多快看完了 他先看完然後他看完之後我就不知道怎麼了 就在淚流滿面然後他講了一段話說我們今天為女性們充滿力量我們強迫他們成為男性 We force them to become competitive, we force them to become tough Because the way the game is played is that way We should empower the feminine When I finished reading it I suddenly had a kind of self-reflection And there was also a feeling of being suddenly hugged by someone I was thinking about myself these few years I seem to be slowly and invisibly turning myself into a very 包括在职场上我真的就觉得我好像很不认输我觉得就是男生能做的事情哪怕扛一个大桶水我也不会去找男生去做我觉得我也同样我也非常的strong就是这种真的是不会认输我想这也给两性关系带来了很多的挑战我会比男性做的更好包括到亲密关系里边我发现我也有这样的事 I don't think I'm a soft woman anymore I hope I earn more than her I hope I work harder for this family than her I don't know why, but suddenly, in the so-called "feminism" that people are more likely to express In fact, there is a misunderstanding Because I think women should be more like the empathy, creative, intuitive that we have. All of these are the most beautiful existence of women. I think we are better than men in showing up. In this world, we have the same rights. It's not better to just become a disease. Because we stand there, sit there, and are already there. It's the most beautiful existence. So I think this sentence is also Mo's encouragement to all women. It's really existance, and it's beautiful. We are encouraging the power of women, but the way to make it happen is to make women more masculine. 所以这个世界就变得就非常有竞争性然后一切都是有一点用力过猛的这种感觉对 不管是男女女女男男都永远都是这样一个compatible的一个氛围对会觉得就是这个世界怎么了对我认为我们的世界在超级男性的苦苦中受苦 And I say that with my weird deep voice, but it's the truth. We've turned it into a world of doing. We just go out there and do stuff. Mostly the wrong stuff. Mostly stuff that we don't need. Mostly stuff that doesn't nourish anyone. Okay? And it's because we've capitalized so entirely in our modern world on skills like analytical thinking, linear thinking, strength. you know, discipline, control. All of these are masculine traits. Mo, he didn't talk about this from the perspective of a man and a woman. He said that feminine and masculine are also from a neutral perspective. Because whether you are a man or a woman, you have both sides. He said that his biggest failure is not... I failed for many many years to empower my feminine side. It's my biggest failure ever. Still is my biggest weakness, even though I've done so much better in the last five and a half years. The balance of the old and the young is very, very important. There must be a masculine aspect, and there must be a feminine aspect. 一个关键词 车 carsMode他在播客当中好几次用汽车去举例超级多车 16辆车为什么有16辆16辆车呢我家有16辆车的原因是因为我以为第一辆车会让我开快 但它没有 So I told myself, it's the color, I should have taken another color. Right? So I bought another one, oh it's the model. Okay? And then I was like, no, but I don't have a fast car, maybe I need a fast car will make me happy. No, a vintage car will make me happy. 你知道發生什麼嗎?每次承諾失去,你會覺得,不不不,可能會更多或更不同,會讓我開心後來,有一天他坐在車裡面一直開著開著說當你開車的時候,你會看著路面我根本不知道在開哪一輛車我都不知道開的是哪一輛車,怎麼會讓你幸福嗎?根本就不是擁有更多的東西,或者擁有更多不同的東西並不會讓你真正感到開心 也是我们前段时间我们其实身上有真实发生一件事情就是理想新出的一辆SUV纯电车然后我们当时去那个展台去看了车真的车好好我们当时还看了那个汽车评论主要是我看然后拉他看我说这车好不好看后来那天就被种草了我们走回车厂说下一天要换真实我们就要换这辆车记不记得啊当时还是你说后来我们又走走走回厂 我們根本就不需要換車好不好那輛車幹啥?好像也沒有什麼特別高級的功能為什麼要換這輛車啊?自己車買了兩年時間都不到我們也沒有太多不滿意的地方當時為什麼會想要說換這輛車其實就覺得那輛車有不同的地方它的造型不同然後後排那個頂配它有一個屏幕然後怎樣怎樣這些東西覺得說我們如果擁有這輛車的話我們會變得比現在要更加的開心 可能那個瞬間有可能會有一刻更加開心但可能就跟換手機一樣尤其是換蘋果手機因為系統都是一樣的那一刻你感覺新手機好開心啊然後過了一天你發現沒有任何的不同甚至你感覺不到說它更快因為現在好多新能過剩 所以不同的東西,更多的東西並不一定會讓我們覺得這個生活更加的幸福還讓我想到我們前段時間,因為我們倆養了兩條狗在養狗之前我們就一直想要有那種願意的生活 想要有這種院子生活,那你要買別墅,起碼得要幾百萬人民幣那要瘋狂工作,掙錢才能夠實現這個夢想好多人可能也是這樣子節奏,掙錢掙錢終於掙了這個錢可以實現自己夢想,去做這個事情我可以給自己帶來快樂 But it was too late. But we went to the village to find a house with a yard. A house with a yard, two floors, 3000 RMB per month. Then we came back. 我就跟她说,奋斗这么久干嘛?打到回吞对,就是你想要的这生活其实你一下就能够实现或许你在奋斗,你在追求那些东西它并不是真正你想要的那个东西如果这个带院子的房子现在就给你3000块钱你就可以搬成,你就可以拿下话 You will think that I don't want to live in that place. What is the reason that prevents you from not wanting to live there? You don't want to give up the convenient things in the city? Or you don't want to give up the things you live in the city? Are you living in the city with all kinds of labels? Or what? Right? I think this is worth it. 思考的一些小问题讲这些其实并不是说我们不应该有梦想不应该是你不要想着说我要挣很多钱买辆跑车然后买个别墅的那都可以也是我想说最后一点莫讲的Ambition跟Expectation这两个非常不同的东西所以想要的任何Ambition都可以 Any ambition you want, hopefully a good ambition. Any ambition is ok. You can say I want to live in this house, drive this car, live this life, wear this watch, etc. All ok. Even if you want to be president. No bad. These ambitions are your motivation. It makes humans better. Maybe the reason for the desire. But you have to understand. It doesn't equal to expectation. You can't use this to evaluate your current life. If you use your ambition to evaluate your current life, 那你永远不开心用梦的说法讲就是Life will never go your way对吧那就永远都不开心因为我们想要的开心其实是Life goes my way我就开心了我没有跟进锻炼我就开心了我比赛我赢了我就开心了对 我挣钱我就开心了我看上这区我就开心了所以就是你可以做各种各样的梦但是要有合理的这种预期才可以 I think there are many things to say And this episode, we are talking about our own perspective I think everyone will have their own feelings Or can absorb different things I'm looking forward to the communication after watching it 我们有一些不同的思想去一起碰撞出更多的火花我觉得也还蛮有意思的是的所以我们应该因为这只波可真的太棒了有可能也会有其他东西就是他会看然后我也看然后我们俩就交流一下交流完了之后可能录一期视频跟大家一起去分享我们从中获得的一些东西大家如果喜欢这种类型的分享的话可以点赞或者留言让我们知道我们进步不能停 下期視頻見Cheers
