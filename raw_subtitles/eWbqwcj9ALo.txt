The 26th Global Climate Summit last year
The world has reached a consensus and promised to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050
To achieve carbon reduction goals
In recent years, the new thinking of "abandoning economic growth" has begun to appear in the West
Today's book "Less is More"
I'm going to introduce what is "abandoned growth"
The author of the book is anthropologist Jason Hickel
He's going to tell you in this book
What is the root cause of ecological disaster?
Who is most responsible for the climate crisis?
And how should we "abandon growth" and move towards an ecologically sustainable society?
Today's climate crisis can be rooted in one question:
Capitalism prioritizes economic growth over ecology
But what is capitalism?
Capitalism does not equal market economy
The market economy has existed since ancient times, but capitalism has only existed for 500 years
It refers to a system that continuously pursues growth and accumulates capital
before capitalism
Economic production revolves around "use value"
That is, the money earned after production will be used for consumption and enjoyment
But capitalism values ​​"exchange value"
Earn money to reinvest and make more next year than this year
Investors will look at how much a company's profits grow each year (profit margin)
If the company doesn't grow year after year, investors will pull out
So if you invest or start a business, make some money and stop
Then you are not really a capitalist because you are not ruled by the logic of economic growth
According to estimates by economists
Global GDP should grow at least 3% per year
In order to maintain the continuous increase in the total profit of large enterprises
But capitalism in order to earn more
It is necessary to unchecked the extraction of natural resources, the continuous production of goods, and the frenzied consumption of people.
the current climate crisis
Then we will ask further
How did capitalism with ecological catastrophe emerge?
Some people will say that this is all driven by "human greed"
Capitalism is just a manifestation of human nature that cannot be avoided
Therefore, the climate crisis is also caused by human beings.
But in fact, capitalism was created by "organizational violence" that took hundreds of years
After the Black Death in 14th century Europe
Labour is at a premium as the population plummets
The serfs realized that they were valuable, so they carried out revolutions and overthrew the serfdom in various places.
Many serfs became free men
Free access to public lands, forests and a self-sufficient life
During this time, farmers do not work for one-third of the year
Called by historians "the golden age of the European proletariat"
At that time, European capitalists and aristocrats found that they could not engage in capitalism.
Because the people's life is so cool, no one wants to go back to being a slave
ＺＺＺ...
So the capitalists thought of a way
It's better to just destroy all the villages they depend on for a living.
then take control of these lands and become privately owned
So you can get a large tract of land for free
can also deprive farmers of their livelihoods
Force them to find work in the city
This is the famous "enclosure movement" in history.
also the origin of capitalism
But after grabbing the land
Capitalists find that there is a big obstacle to promoting capitalism
Even medieval peasants believed in "animism"
The Earth is considered a living Mother Earth
We cannot over-exploit natural resources in order to fight for the economy, only moderate development
like you would ask your mom for pocket money
But you won't cook your mother to eat
But in the era of the scientific revolution
Bacon, the father of science, transformed the image of nature as the "mother of the earth"
Bacon said: The earth is not the mother of the earth
but a "wild whore"
is a bitch
Humans must rely on the power of science to conquer the bitch of nature
dig out its secrets
So the new concept of dominating nature and exploiting nature began to appear
That's how capitalism works
Simultaneously
Philosopher Descartes also proposed a set of dualistic philosophy
He believes that people are different from all things, and that people have a thinking soul
But animals and plants in nature cannot think and have no soul
Just waiting to be mined by humans
Because the human body is also a part of nature
Therefore, the mind can use "work discipline" to control the body and use the body as a labor tool to enslave
If you are poor, you don't know how to use your body's productivity, you only know how to play
So poverty is not because capitalists exploit you
It's because you don't know how to play your own "value"
Capitalism is based on this cosmology that exploits nature and the body
This is why human ancestors have not developed capitalism for the past few hundred thousand years
Because our ancestors were unwilling for economic development
To exploit the earth, exploit other people's labor
So capitalism is not a display of greedy humanity
Instead, it makes people forget the humanity that we have kept for hundreds of thousands of years.
more importantly
The economic development that capitalism promises people doesn't actually come true
When capitalism everywhere colonized the world
The English philosopher Locke defended:
Stealing land is a form of violence yes, but it is reasonable and ethical
Because capitalists can greatly increase the productivity of the land
Unleash the true value of land
Otherwise, wouldn't it be a waste of Native Americans to have so much land undeveloped?
Locke's theory was written into the international law of the time
Allow Europeans to colonize all over the world
But historians found
As capitalism spreads around the world, the economy appears to have grown
But the increased profits go into the pockets of the capitalists
The quality of life of the common people has declined
Because every time capitalism reaches a new location
must first engage in "artificial scarcity"
For example, when the British colonized India in the 19th century
to develop capitalism
Must first burn down local orchards and dismantle the local community support system
Depriving Indians of self-sufficiency
They only work for the capitalists, because without work you have nothing to eat
Historian Mike Davies found
This move by British capitalists tripled crop yields
But the crops are all exported to Europe, but the local people have nothing to eat
As a result, 30 million Indians died of famine
"Late Victorian Holocaust"
India is fucking poor, but Britain has squeezed 45 trillion
Half of the British treasury budget in the 19th century came from overseas colonies
So capitalism is actually very contradictory:
In order to promote economic growth, it must first destroy the ecological environment and create poverty
The Scottish aristocrat Earl of Lauderdale first discovered this contradiction
So this is also called "Lauderdale paradox" lauderdale paradox
That is, whenever private wealth increases, public wealth decreases.
There is an inverse relationship between the two
In other words, "poverty" and "ecological destruction" are necessary conditions for capitalist economic growth
History from this point of view
We'll find colonialism in history, and the climate crisis today
are rooted in the essence of capitalism: the blind pursuit of economic growth
This is not because of "human nature", it happens to be the result of forgetting "human nature"
If capitalism is to blame for the climate crisis
Why do countries in the world regard GDP as a development indicator?
The Great Depression of the 1930s
The U.S. government taps economist Simon Kuznets to devise a standard to measure the economy
Kuznets designed GDP
But at the same time, he found two serious flaws in GDP
First, it does not take into account the cost to society
When you chop down a tree and build lumber, GDP goes up
When you work longer hours, stay up late and work overtime, GDP rises
GDP rises when you're sick to the doctor
Simply put, GDP masks a lot of bad things happening
It does not take into account whether economic activities are harmful to the environment or to human physical and mental health
At the same time, GDP hides a lot of good things
If you take care of your parents, do housework, grow your own plants
None of this counts in GDP
But it is clear that these activities are really caring for others and caring for the earth
So Kuznets warns the US government not to use GDP as an indicator
But by the time the OECD was established in 1960, goals were set
Assist countries in advancing policies to achieve maximum economic growth rates
The British government will immediately follow up, to achieve 50% economic growth in 10 years
For the first time in human history, economic growth has become a national goal
Why is this so?
Because after World War II, Western countries were fighting the Cold War with the Soviet Union
How to decide which system is better, capitalism or communism?
Very simple, the faster the GDP grows, the symbol of a strong country
Because the higher the GDP, the more arms you can buy
GDP has become a competitive bargaining chip in international politics
Therefore, Western capitalist countries seem to be opposed to the Soviet Union and the CCP
But they all obey the same GDP indicator
Blind pursuit of economic growth regardless of the ecological environment
This has led to the explosive growth of the "Global Materials Footprint" since 1945
Material footprint refers to the amount of raw material mined
Therefore, the larger the material footprint, the greater the ecological impact.
Scientists believe that the critical value the earth can withstand a year is 50 billion tons
But today the global material footprint has doubled
So now we have to ask, who is responsible for the climate collapse?
If you only look at carbon emissions
China and the US are the biggest carbon emitters
But China's population is so large, the carbon emissions will be relatively high
Therefore, it should be accurate to look at the per capita carbon emissions.
And don't forget
Rich countries often outsource industrial production to cheap labor in poor countries
Use this to "outsource" your own carbon emissions to the third world
So if you want to know exactly the carbon emission responsibility of each country
It is necessary to consider "population size" and "foreign carbon emissions"
The author calculated the carbon emissions of countries around the world from 1850 to 2015.
turn out
The proportion of global excess carbon emissions
US contributed 40%, EU contributed 29%
The rich northern countries account for only 19% of the world's population, but produce 92% of excess carbon emissions
So the author says that what we are facing today is "atmospheric colonization"
The atmosphere of the earth is like a common land, everyone is entitled to a small share
But developed countries are producing too much carbon emissions
Squeeze out carbon emissions that other poor countries can make
What's worse is
The capitalist life enjoyed in the wealthy western countries
In fact, they all depend on the exploitation of natural resources and cheap labor in developing countries.
But the consequences of the climate crisis are borne by people in developing countries
In 2010, 400,000 people worldwide died of famine due to the climate crisis, 98% of which occurred in poor countries
Because these poor countries don't have enough money, construction to deal with the climate crisis
So the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit
US sets target for warming to no more than 2 degrees C
Ambassadors representing 77 developing countries at the time said it was a suicide deal
Two degrees is
a certain death for Africa.
Because 2 degrees C is the critical value that will affect western countries
rather than a critical value for developing countries
For developing countries, climate disasters are already happening
So the economist Giorgos Kallis points out
We shouldn't be designing climate models to predict the limits of economic growth
Because we haven't hit the limit yet, the climate crisis is already happening around the world
It's just that the western media avoids talking about climate disasters in the third world
Don't tell you: Drought in Africa's Somaliland kills 70% of the country's livestock
Only report climate hazards in developed countries: US hurricanes, European heat waves, Australian wildfires
So in summary:
Rich countries bear most responsibility for climate crisis
To keep warming below 2 degrees C
Rich countries must reach zero carbon emissions by 2030
To achieve this goal, we must stop pursuing economic growth
While debating how to tackle the climate crisis
People who support capitalism will jump out and say
We should let capitalism solve ecological problems
As long as countries switch to green energy, use electric vehicles
continue to pursue economic growth
So we should have more capitalism investing in green tech to save the world
The author also accepts this position at the beginning
But after years of research, he found that "green energy capitalism" simply won't work
Because as early as the industrial revolution, the same argument appeared
Because technology makes efficiency higher, capitalists can generate electricity at very low cost
You can use the money you save to invest in more businesses and expand production capacity
Therefore, the amount of coal used has increased
Capitalists invest in technology, not to reduce energy consumption
but to pursue more economic growth
So the author reminds us
Don't easily believe that investing in new technology can save the world
That's right, transitioning to 100% renewable energy is a priority
However, if we continue to pursue GDP growth in the process of transformation
will require more energy and produce more carbon emissions
So even though renewable energy reduces carbon emissions a bit
Still no match for the speed at which the global economy produces carbon emissions
Therefore, it is necessary to pursue green energy transformation, and at the same time abandon growth
To truly achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050
Now let's bust the growth myth
Many people would think that the past few hundred years
Economic growth promotes technological and material life progress
Now we have a high quality of life
But where did the concept of "economic growth = happy life" come from?
Actually from the 1970s
Public health scholar Thomas McKeown discovered
Average life expectancy in the UK has grown significantly since the 1870s
He thinks the only reasonable explanation is
People live longer because the industrial revolution made GDP grow and capitalism made the country rich
But later researchers found
The real reason is actually the improvement of public health facilities
Originally, the sewage and drinking water systems in the UK were not separated
Because of the need for public funds and the acquisition of private real estate to make a sewer system
So it has always been opposed by the capitalist class
Until the 1870s when labor launched the charter movement, fighting for the right to vote, and the rise of labor unions
It was only in the UK that a policy of taking care of labor emerged, building public health facilities across the country
By the 20th century, public health care systems, universal health care, and child vaccinations
So it's not capitalist economic growth that improves national health
It's a labor-initiated social movement
Causes the country to be willing to invest money in public health and public health care
Extending life expectancy in European and American countries
In fact
The first 200 years of capitalism in Europe
Average life expectancy in the UK drops from 43 to 30
This is the healthy price to pay in pursuit of economic growth
What is the relationship between GDP and people's happiness?
Economist Richard Easterlin found that
Americans were the happiest in the 1950s
U.S. GDP has grown since the 1950s, but Americans aren't happier
Why? Shouldn't you be happier with more money?
Because the growth of income itself is not the key, the key is how to distribute the income
think about it
If you get a $10,000 raise this year, you should be happy
But would you be happy if you found out that the CEO of the company has raised his salary by 3 million this year?
CEO-to-employee pay ratio in the US today: 350 to 1
The benefits of economic growth have been taken away by the capital
This uneven distribution makes ordinary people feel social injustice and distrust each other
So ecological economist Herman Daly found
As long as GDP grows to a certain level, it has nothing to do with people's happiness
If you continue to pursue growth, it will have a negative impact on society.
Because it will increase inequality and tear society apart
Giving workers too much work load leads to poor health
Destroy the ecological environment, causing air pollution and environmental problems
Fair distribution of income not only helps to improve national happiness
It actually helps reduce carbon
Because the richest 1% in the world drive sports cars, private jets and travel every day
They produce a hundred times more carbon than half the world's poor combined
So economist Thomas Piketty said:
Reducing the purchasing power of the world's richest people could have a positive impact on global carbon reduction
Because the way of life of the rich is itself destroying the earth
Except for the equitable distribution of income
Research survey finds countries with the highest national happiness in the world
Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland
These countries all have one feature: a well-established social welfare system
Why does a country with a better welfare system have a higher sense of happiness?
Because when the basic needs of life are taken care of by the state, the influence of personal income is reduced
think about it
In the US, even if you make $30,000 a year
You still can’t pay college tuition, medical bills, and rent
But in Finland, there is public healthcare, free education, rent control
Your annual salary of 30,000 can be spent elsewhere
So the same is the annual salary of 30,000
In America you don't feel alive, but in Finland you feel rich
Because when social welfare takes care of the basic life of citizens
you will be able to use your personal income freely
So in summary
What a country wants is not economic growth, but "fair distribution" and "social welfare"
is the key to making citizens truly happy.
After breaking the myth of economic growth
How to actually achieve "abandonment to grow"?
The author points out several clear directions that can be done
The first is: termination of planned obsolescence
What is planned obsolescence?
That is, capitalism deliberately shortens the life of products for economic growth.
So you have to keep spending, buying a new generation of products
For example, every time an electronic device is upgraded, a new socket, USB
Or Apple secretly slowing down older iPhones to get consumers to switch to new ones
This gets Apple fined 25 million euros in 2020
And the reason why IKEA can become an international famous brand
Also by inventing all kinds of short-lived disposable furniture
Because of these planned obsolescence
More than 100 million discarded computers and home appliances are shipped to African countries every year
Toxic substances from electronics seep into their soil
endangering the health of Africans
Therefore, western countries replace new 3C products every year and enjoy economic growth
However, African countries have to suffer from abandoned 3C products and ecological disasters every year.
This problem also highlights:
Capitalism claims that the market economy is the most efficient
But in fact planned obsolescence is deliberate inefficiency
Deliberately producing products that are more prone to breakage for economic growth
It is also because of planned scrapping that the demand for chips has increased year by year.
Caused Taiwan's tech workers to work overtime
So capitalism is actually very irrational
Because it makes the labor force to produce inefficient products, and it also harms the ecological environment
A truly rational economic system should end planned scrapping
Let technology companies develop and innovate products that are truly durable
Or through legislation, standardize manufacturers to guarantee the life of products and extend the warranty period
Extending the lifespan of products allows people to reduce consumption and slow the extraction of natural resources
The second step in “Growth Abandonment” is to reduce advertising
When there was no advertising before the 1920s
People only buy what they need
Once your needs are met, you won't buy again
This prevents capitalism from chasing more profits
So capitalists began to invest a lot of money in the development of the advertising industry
Make people feel that they are never satisfied and never have enough
This will boost consumption
By the 1990s
Nine out of 10 CEOs in the U.S. believe they can’t sell a product without advertising
50% of people believe that advertising makes them buy things they don't really want
Therefore, the human nature view of "limited resources and unlimited desires"
It was actually created by capitalism
It is not that there is demand before supply, many demands are actually created by advertising
For example, the clothing industry has long discovered that the clothing market has long been oversaturated
So they envisioned "fast fashion"
There are new trends every season, so clothes from the previous season are destined to be eliminated
This is how capitalism uses advertising to fuel planned obsolescence for economic growth
In the UK, fast fashion has increased textile usage by 37% in 4 years
80% reduction in textile throughput if the fast fashion industry were regulated
go a long way in mitigating the climate crisis
But the people who support the ad will say:
Advertising can provide people with sufficient information to make rational judgments
But the truth is, most ads are meant to make you make irrational judgments
E.g
Did you really get more information after watching these advertisements?
In fact, the emergence of the Internet and Youtube has long made us no longer need advertisements.
You can check online to see product features, online reviews, and unboxing videos
These are more useful than flashy ads
Therefore, reducing advertising and slowing down unnecessary consumption is the second step in abandoning growth.
The third step to abandoning growth is ending food waste
Everyone may not know
50% of the food produced worldwide ends up going to waste every year
in other words
If we cut our food production in half, our lives wouldn't be affected
For example, if you go to a convenience store, a lot of expired food will not be sold.
Or a lot of food rots in transit and can't be sold
Scholars Estimate
If the global food industry halved production, it could cut carbon by 12%
while bringing the land back to life
So in recent years, France and Italy have used laws to prohibit supermarkets from wasting food
Must donate unsellable food to charity
South Korea even legislates to charge extra for throwing away food waste
As a result, the country reduced the amount of food waste by 300 tons in one day.
This is the practical and feasible abandonment of growth
The last step in abandoning growth: scaling back ecologically damaging industries
Many industries are unnecessary to society and cause ecological damage
Like fossil fuels, private jets, the arms industry, advertising
Planned obsolescence, fast fashion, beef industry, disposable plastic
If we make these industries smaller
It can release more carbon emission space to developing countries
so that their society can truly develop
It is not that the earth will be brought down by western countries before it develops
These are the four practical steps to abandon growth
Termination of planned obsolescence
reduce advertising
end food waste
Scaling down ecologically damaging industries
In today's video we introduce the latest western economic thinking "abandoning growth"
The author also reminds us at the end of the book
To transform the capitalist economy, one must also transform the capitalist culture
The capitalist cosmology holds that man can exploit nature endlessly
This concept actually only existed on earth for 500 years.
Indigenous peoples around the world today actually still believe in "animism"
For example, the Achuar people of the Amazon rainforest
that animals and plants are just as conscious as humans
Women raise plants, so plants are like their own children
Men hunt with respect for their prey because animals are like family
For the Achuar, the forest is not a place to forage, but a place to socialize
In recent years this animism has even gained legal recognition
For example, in 2020, the New Zealand government will grant the status of a "legal person" to the Whanganui River
Therefore, if a company pollutes the river, it is equal to harming people and can be prosecuted by law
We may find it strange to think of nature as human
But don't forget that capitalism also treats businesses as legal persons
Social networking sites, oil companies, all enjoy human-like legal status
Since oil companies can be regarded as human beings, why not the natural environment?
Our human ancestors were animistic
Harmony with nature for hundreds of thousands of years
But it took only 500 years for capitalism to rip the earth
So it's time to learn from our human ancestors their wisdom
Rethinking the relationship between humans and ecosystems
Beyond Capitalism and the Climate Crisis with a Growth Mindset
Building a sustainable society for future generations
