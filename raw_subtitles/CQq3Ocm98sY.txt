Okay,
 everyone.
 By
 popular
 demand,
 we're


doing
 an
 all
 Epstein
 show
 today.
 My


besties
 are
 all
 on
 vacation
 for
 ski


week,
 so
 I'm
 taking
 this
 on
 solo.
 We


have
 three
 different
 guests
 on
 who
 all


have
 very
 different
 interpretations
 and


opinions
 of
 the
 Epstein
 story.
 Sagar
 and


Jetty
 from
 Breaking
 Points
 believes
 that


the
 Epste
 shows
 that
 there
 is
 a
 quote


unquote
 Epstein
 class
 that
 operates


above
 law
 and
 accountability.
 He
 views


the
 story
 as
 an
 indictment
 of
 our
 ruling


elites.
 Michael
 Tracy
 is
 skeptical
 about


many
 of
 the
 most
 salicious
 claims
 about


Epstein
 and
 questions
 whether
 they
 meet


any
 kind
 of
 evidentiary
 standard.
 He
 has


criticized
 the
 media
 feeding
 frenzy
 over


what
 he
 has
 called
 Epstein
 mythology.


And
 finally,
 Kevin
 Bass,
 a
 citizen


journalist
 who's
 been
 tracking
 the


release
 files
 and
 posting
 his
 findings


on
 X,
 specifically
 in
 regards
 to
 Reed


Hoffman,
 perhaps
 the
 figure
 in
 tech
 most


closely
 associated
 with
 Jeffrey
 Epstein.


Some
 of
 it
 gets
 heated,
 but
 hopefully


you'll
 come
 away
 with
 new
 perspectives


and
 great
 information.
 I
 felt
 like
 it


was
 important
 to
 showcase
 a
 range
 of


viewpoints
 on
 this
 issue.
 I'm
 trying
 to


keep
 an
 open
 mind
 and
 I'll
 describe
 my


own
 point
 of
 view
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


show.
 And
 with
 that,
 here
 we
 go.
 Sager,


let
 me
 start
 with
 you.
 What
 is
 the


import
 of
 the
 arrest
 of
 Prince
 Andrew
 in


the
 UK
 this
 morning?
 I
 mean,
 is
 this
 a


case
 of
 show
 us
 the
 man
 and
 we'll
 tell


you
 the
 crime?
 I
 mean,
 it
 obviously
 it


seems
 kind
 of
 coincidental
 that
 he's
 not


being
 arrested
 for
 misconduct
 in
 the


Epstein
 affair.
 He's
 being
 arrested
 on


mishandling,


I
 guess,
 trade
 secrets
 or
 public


documents.
 So,
 obviously,
 the
 timing
 of


this
 is
 not
 coincidental.


>> No,
 it's
 certainly
 not
 coincidental,
 but


I
 do
 believe
 that
 the
 facts
 do
 matter
 in


this
 case.
 And
 uh
 unfortunately,
 you


know,
 for
 Prince
 Andrew,
 for
 Lord


Mandlesson,
 the
 former
 ambassador
 uh
 to


the
 United
 States
 from
 the
 UK
 as
 well,


it
 is
 pretty
 clear-cut
 that
 they
 did


violate
 their
 official
 duties.
 We
 should


remember
 that
 the
 crux
 of
 this
 case


involving
 Andrew
 is
 not
 just
 about
 some


of
 the
 accusations
 that
 were
 made,


although
 that
 is
 the
 genesis,
 let's
 say,


of
 the
 investigation
 and
 of
 the


interest.
 This
 is
 about
 Prince
 Andrew


serving
 as
 a
 UK
 trade
 adviser
 and


forwarding
 non-public
 information
 to


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 has
 been
 released
 that's


currently
 in
 the
 file.
 Some
 of
 it
 is


involving
 scheduling.
 However,
 uh
 Gordon


Brown
 this
 morning
 said
 that
 he
 had


actually
 shared
 some
 new
 information


with
 Scotland
 Yard
 in
 the
 police.
 So,


none,
 it's
 not
 exactly
 just
 what's
 in


the
 file,
 but
 it
 could
 potentially
 be


other
 uh
 material
 that
 Gordon
 Brown
 and


the
 chancellory
 were
 able
 to
 investigate


as
 to
 what
 Prince
 Andrew
 was
 sharing
 as


part
 of
 a
 broader
 probe
 into
 Lord


Mandelson
 and
 the
 tip
 off
 that
 he
 gave


to
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 about
 an
 upcoming


bailout.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 that
 this
 does


reveal
 quite
 a
 lot
 about
 Jeffrey


Epstein.
 The
 next
 is
 the
 genesis
 of
 his


rise
 to
 power,
 his
 wealth,
 and
 his


influence.
 something
 that
 involved
 let's


say
 even
 some
 of
 the
 co-hosts
 uh
 let's


say
 on
 this
 very
 podcast
 which
 is
 a
 deep


financial
 knowledge
 of
 moneyaundering


networks
 of
 trying
 to
 be
 at
 the
 very


forefront
 of
 moving
 money
 across
 the


globe
 which
 I
 believe
 is
 his
 real
 power


and
 his
 influence
 which
 is
 what
 enabled


much
 of
 the
 behavior
 that
 much
 of
 the


public
 is
 now
 horrified
 by


>> okay
 wait
 I
 I
 can't
 let
 that
 just
 go
 by


what
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 involving
 co-host
 of


this
 podcast


>> I'm
 talking
 about
 Jason
 I
 actually


thought
 that
 the
 Jason
 email
 uh
 was
 Very


interesting.
 So
 you'll
 see
 that
 in
 2011


that
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 is
 contacting
 Jason


about
 Bitcoin.
 This
 is
 by
 I
 saw
 I


watched
 your
 discussion.
 I'm
 not


implicating
 him
 in
 any
 crime.
 I'm
 saying


if
 you
 watch
 and
 look
 at
 that
 email
 very


closely,
 you
 are
 watching
 Jeffrey


Epstein,
 a
 master
 money
 launderer
 and


financial
 mastermind
 himself,
 be
 at
 the


forefront
 of
 the
 Bitcoin
 technology
 and


wondering
 about
 it
 in
 2011,
 which
 as


Jason
 even
 pointed
 out
 in
 the
 last


episode
 that
 you
 guys
 did
 about
 this


when
 Bitcoin
 was
 some
 $1
 and
 some
 sort


of
 open-source
 project.
 Like
 to
 me
 that


shows
 how
 at
 the
 forefront
 he
 was
 of
 new


technology
 and
 new
 ways
 to
 move
 money


surreptitiously
 across
 the
 globe,
 which


is
 what
 I
 believe
 was
 his
 real
 strength


and
 his
 basically
 um
 his
 his
 uh
 raise
 on


detra
 for
 being
 so
 useful
 to
 all
 of


these
 different
 foreign
 governments
 and


intelligence
 assets
 including
 ours,


Russia,
 Israel,
 various
 different


Israeli
 or
 various
 different


intelligence
 uh
 networks
 across
 the


globe.
 Yeah,
 let
 me
 just
 for
 for
 viewers


of
 this
 episode
 who
 didn't
 see
 that


episode,
 let
 me
 just
 summarize
 what


exactly
 happened
 there
 because
 I
 want
 to


just
 make
 sure
 that


>> Jason's
 reputation
 is
 not
 unfairly


impuged.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 you're
 doing


that,
 but
 just
 to
 be
 absolutely
 clear


about
 it,
 what
 happened
 was
 that
 Jason


hosted
 an
 episode
 of
 This
 Week
 in


Startups
 roughly,
 I
 think
 in
 2011,
 with


a
 couple
 of
 the
 Bitcoin
 core
 founders


and
 then
 Epstein
 reached
 out
 to
 him
 for


an
 introduction
 to
 those
 people.
 I


thought
 and
 and
 one
 of
 my
 takeaways
 from


that
 was
 like
 you
 said
 Sagar
 that
 Epste


was
 extraordinarily
 early
 to
 Bitcoin.
 He


clearly
 had
 a
 nose
 for
 putting
 himself


in
 the
 middle
 of
 things.
 I
 think
 2011
 is


when
 I
 discovered
 Bitcoin.
 So
 that
 was


relatively
 early.
 I
 thought
 it
 was


almost
 comical
 the
 way
 that
 Jason
 was


trying
 to
 warn
 Epstein,
 oh,
 you
 don't


want
 to
 meet
 these
 guys.
 These
 are
 some


these
 are
 some
 crazies.
 They're
 like


these
 crypto
 libertarians.
 They
 want
 to


take
 down
 the
 government.
 There's
 no


profit.
 Um
 there's
 no
 investment


opportunity
 here.
 In
 a
 way,
 it
 was
 kind


of
 comical
 that
 Jason
 was
 trying
 to
 warn


Epstein
 about
 the
 Bitcoin
 guys
 rather


than
 vice
 versa.
 But
 I
 don't
 really


think
 people
 knew
 at
 that
 point
 in
 time


what
 Epstein
 was
 involved
 in.
 Do
 you


disagree
 with
 that?
 Do
 you
 think
 people


should
 have
 known
 by
 2011?
 Well,
 David,


I
 mean,
 I
 will
 say
 there
 is
 a
 way
 back


machine
 and
 we
 can
 go
 back
 and
 we
 can


look
 at
 what
 the
 Google
 results
 were
 and


we
 do
 have
 somebody
 who
 pled
 guilty.
 And


look,
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 for
 every


individual
 to
 make
 up
 their
 own
 mind.


You
 can't
 Google
 for
 solicitation
 of


prostitution
 involving
 a
 minor.
 I
 mean,


that
 was
 literally
 a
 matter
 of
 public


record.
 I
 can
 only
 speak
 for
 myself.


That's
 not
 really
 somebody
 I
 would


involve
 myself
 with,
 even
 at
 a


professional
 level.
 Uh,
 and
 had
 you


known?


>> Well,
 you
 can
 Google
 it.
 It's
 literally


public,


>> but
 it
 wasn't
 widely
 publicized
 at
 the


time.


Palm
 Beach
 Post.
 There
 were
 numerous


news
 articles.


>> I
 thought
 the
 Palm
 Beach
 story
 didn't


come
 out
 until
 or
 sorry,
 maybe
 it
 was


the
 Miami
 Herald
 didn't
 come
 out
 till


2018.


>> Well,
 you're
 Yeah,
 you're
 talking
 about


the
 2018
 kind
 of
 the
 broader
 story,
 but


the
 original
 solicitation
 of
 prosecution


involving
 a
 minor
 charge,
 2007,
 I


believe,
 is
 when
 the
 nonprosecution


agreement
 came
 to
 bear.
 That
 was
 all


public
 record
 in
 terms
 of
 registration


of
 a
 sex
 offender.
 And
 again,
 you
 can


use
 the
 way
 back
 machine
 and
 you
 can
 go


back
 and
 look.
 I
 mean
 again
 this
 doesn't


necessarily
 implicate
 anybody
 in
 a
 crime


and
 anybody
 can
 make
 up
 the
 decision
 for


themselves
 as
 to
 how
 they
 would
 have
 uh


you
 know
 involved
 themselves
 with
 that


person
 but
 it
 was
 it
 was
 out
 there
 like


it
 wasn't
 uh
 unknown
 and
 I
 do
 think
 it's


not
 really
 responsible
 to
 imply


otherwise.


>> Quick
 factual
 clarification
 on
 that


although
 it
 wasn't
 an
 enormous
 story
 at


the
 time.
 You
 can
 find
 coverage
 in
 the


New
 York
 Times
 in
 July
 of
 2008
 after


Epstein
 pleaded
 guilty
 to
 the
 two
 state


level
 prostitution
 charges.
 We
 didn't


have
 the
 full
 scope
 of
 the
 information


obviously
 about
 what
 he
 was
 accused
 of


or
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 nonprosecution


agreement,
 but
 a
 Google
 search
 would


have
 yielded
 that
 at
 that
 time.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 judge.
 I


certainly
 in
 that
 time
 period
 had
 never


even
 heard
 of
 Jeffrey
 Epstein


and
 I
 don't
 think
 most
 people
 had.
 When


did
 this
 become
 sort
 of
 a
 cause
 celeb?
 I


mean,
 wasn't
 it
 more
 around
 his


>> 2018?
 I
 would
 say


>> 2018.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 to


explain
 and


>> when
 the
 incredibly
 overrated
 Miami


Herald
 series
 by
 Julie
 K.
 Brown,
 which


is
 just
 r
 rife
 with
 errors
 and


mischaracterizations


became
 this
 sensation
 across
 the
 media


landscape
 and
 Julie
 K.
 Brown
 was


showered
 with
 all
 these
 accolades
 from


all
 these
 bogus
 journalism
 industry


organizations.
 Even
 though,
 for
 example,


I
 caught
 her
 fabricating
 quotes
 in
 her


book,
 Coversion
 of
 Justice,
 which
 was


based
 on
 the
 initial
 Miami
 Herald


series.
 But
 Michael,
 I
 don't
 think
 that


you
 would
 clownish
 people
 in
 the


journalism
 landscape.


>> Michael,
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 you
 would


deny
 that
 ultimately
 that
 this
 did
 not


Yes,
 it
 was
 sparked
 by
 Julie
 K. K. K. K.


K. K. K. K. K. K.
 Brown's
 Miami
 Herald


story
 is
 that
 a
 federal
 judge
 was
 not


necessarily
 like,
 you
 know,
 a
 federal


judge
 who
 reviewed
 the
 nonprosecution


agreement
 did
 say
 that
 this
 was
 a


violation
 of
 the
 Crime
 Victim's
 Rights


Act
 because


>> that
 was
 overturned
 on
 appeal.


>> Right.
 Well,
 I
 understand,
 however,
 that


this
 has
 also
 gone
 forth
 to
 the
 Supreme


Court
 involving
 Gain
 Maxwell.
 As
 I


understand
 now,
 is
 currently
 being


litigated.
 But
 I
 do
 think
 it
 is


important.


>> The
 Supreme
 Court
 rejected
 it.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 what
 I'm
 what
 I'm
 talking


about.


>> Maxwell's
 appeal
 appeal.


>> I'm
 talking
 about
 the
 Maxwell
 appeal,


but
 specifically
 the
 nonprosecution


agreement
 and
 the
 overturning
 is
 what
 re


led
 to
 the
 current
 indictment
 of
 the


2019
 indictment
 of
 Jeffrey
 Epste.
 No,


>> that's
 wrong,
 Sager.


>> No.
 Well,
 go
 ahead.
 You
 I'm
 happy
 for


you
 to
 explain
 it
 to
 me.
 Go
 ahead.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 a
 misconception.


The
 nonprosecution
 agreement
 was
 never


overturned.
 Gileain
 Maxwell's
 argument


includes
 Let
 me
 just
 finish.


>> Sure.
 Gileain
 Maxwell's
 argument
 in
 her


appeals
 included
 citing
 the


nonprosecution
 agreement
 as
 something


that
 she
 claimed
 she
 ought
 to
 have
 been


covered
 by.
 Yes.
 And
 therefore
 insulated


from
 federal
 prosecution
 which
 was


initiated
 against
 her
 in
 2020.
 The


nonprosecution
 agreement
 was
 never


nullified.
 It
 was
 never
 voided.
 Bradley


Edwards,
 the
 victim
 lawyer,
 attempted
 to


convince
 federal
 judges
 to
 somehow


nullify
 it,
 but
 he
 failed.
 The
 reason


why
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 was
 federally


reprosecuted
 in
 2019
 is
 because


prosecutors
 in
 the
 Southern
 District
 of


New
 York,
 Moren
 Comey
 at
 all,
 concocted


this
 cockamame
 rationale
 for
 how
 they


could
 circumvent
 the
 nonprosecution


agreement
 by
 picking
 claiming
 they
 found


a
 new
 victim
 in
 New
 York,
 claiming
 that


there
 was
 some
 interstate
 nexus
 in
 which


they
 could
 tie
 some
 of
 the
 old
 Florida


allegations,
 but
 it
 was
 never
 nullified


at
 all.
 So
 just
 I
 I
 apologize
 for
 not


being
 very
 specific
 in
 my
 language.
 It


was
 ruled
 in
 2019
 that
 it
 had
 violated


the
 Crime
 Victim's
 Rights
 Act.
 That's


what
 led
 to
 the
 reindictment.
 But
 what


I'm
 spec
 Well,
 no,


>> there
 was
 no
 connection.


>> Well,
 no,
 because
 that
 led
 to
 the
 story


reopening
 from
 Miami
 Herald
 and
 that
 led


then
 to
 the
 2019
 SDNY.


>> You
 got
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 sorry,
 not
 to
 be


combative,
 but
 you
 have
 your
 chronology


wrong.
 The
 Miami
 Herald
 story
 was
 based


on
 Julie
 K.
 Brown.
 Julie
 Yeah,
 that
 was


based
 on
 Julie
 K.
 around
 colluding
 with


the
 victim's
 lawyers,
 not
 the
 court


ruling
 on
 the
 crimes
 victim's
 rights


act.


>> All
 right,
 guys.
 Let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 get


control
 of
 this
 again
 because
 I
 think


we're
 going
 down
 a
 rabbit
 hole
 and


there's
 lots
 of
 aspects
 of
 this
 story


that
 that
 we
 could
 discuss.
 I
 think
 that


>> we
 should
 probably
 judge
 each
 person
 who


interacted
 with
 Epstein
 or
 visited
 his


island
 and
 so
 forth
 and
 so
 on


individually
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 they


actually
 did,
 what
 they
 actually
 knew.


Sar,
 I
 just
 think
 you're
 being
 a
 little


bit
 unfair
 to
 Jason
 because
 all
 he
 did


was
 exchange
 emails
 with


>> I
 I
 don't
 think
 in
 the
 2011
 time
 period.


That's
 all.


>> Well,
 what
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 point
 out
 was


Jeffrey
 Epstein's
 knowledge
 or
 interest


of
 Bitcoin
 in
 2011.
 And
 that
 links
 to
 a


broader
 Epstein
 involvement
 with
 money


laundering
 and
 tax
 fraud
 and
 so-called


involvement
 with
 Leon
 Black
 and
 many
 of


these
 other
 multi-billionaires
 who
 paid


him
 lots
 of
 money.
 I'm
 just
 saying
 I'm


putting
 that
 as
 part
 of
 into
 a
 broader


scheme.


>> Yes.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 exchange
 was


noteworthy
 for
 the
 reason
 you
 just
 said,


which
 is
 that
 Epstein
 somehow
 was


putting
 himself
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 all


sorts
 of
 things.
 I
 mean,
 he's
 almost


like
 a
 Zeligike
 figure
 who
 pops
 up
 in


many
 different
 newsworthy
 stories
 over


the
 last
 few
 decades,
 which
 is
 what
 I


think
 makes
 this
 interesting.
 I
 think


maybe
 a
 question
 for
 each
 of
 you
 is
 who


do
 you
 think
 this
 guy
 ultimately
 was?
 I


mean,
 you
 hear
 all
 sorts
 of
 theories.


Let's
 say
 maybe
 the
 Epstein
 maximalist


position
 would
 be
 that
 he
 was
 an


intelligence
 asset
 or
 intelligence
 agent


who
 was
 running
 a
 vast
 compromat


operation
 on
 his
 island
 and
 thereby
 was


corrupting
 and
 blackmailing
 the
 world's


elite
 to
 someone
 who
 uh
 I
 think
 Michael


you
 you
 have
 a
 different
 point
 of
 view


on
 that.
 Let
 me
 not
 characterize
 it.


I'll
 let
 you
 guys
 do
 it,
 but
 Sagar,
 let


me
 start
 with
 you.
 Who
 do
 you
 think
 this


guy
 was?
 And
 ultimately,
 you
 know,
 at
 a


30,000
 ft
 level,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 is


going
 on
 here?
 What
 is
 this
 Epstein


story
 really
 about?
 And
 then
 Michael,
 I


want
 to
 go
 to
 you
 on
 the
 same
 question.


>> Yeah,
 sure.
 I
 mean,
 I
 do
 think
 that


there
 is
 a
 very
 low
 IQ
 unfortunate,
 you


know,
 explosion
 of
 accusations
 that
 are


out
 there.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 be
 very


responsible
 in
 the
 way
 that
 I
 describe


it.
 I
 think
 that
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 was


somebody
 who
 arose
 under
 very
 suspicious


conditions
 uh
 in
 the
 1980s
 potentially


involving
 Iran
 Contra
 knowledge


specifically
 with
 arms
 traffickers
 like


Adnan
 Kosigible
 and
 Douglas
 Lease
 Steven


Hoffenberg
 as
 well
 and
 that
 these
 black


market
 moneyaundering
 tax
 evasion


strategies
 were
 honed
 over
 a
 period


which
 eventually
 inspired
 various
 people


like
 Lesie
 Wexner
 and
 many
 other


multi-billionaires
 and
 that
 at
 the
 very


same
 time
 he
 also
 had
 you
 know
 his


sexual
 proclivities
 which
 I
 think
 at


this
 point
 were
 wellknown
 and
 that
 those


became
 and
 became
 useful
 his


moneyaundering
 specific
 uh
 duties
 and


knowledge
 and
 usefulness
 let's
 say
 to


the
 CIA
 to
 various
 other
 intelligence


assets
 became
 a
 very
 useful
 part
 of
 the


nexus
 in
 the
 postcold
 war
 environment


and
 that
 at
 the
 time
 it
 was
 also


socially
 known
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 Epstein


associates
 that
 he
 had
 this
 bizarre


practice
 of
 often
 you
 know
 seeking
 out


massages
 which
 In
 some
 cases,
 they
 are


saying
 involving
 underage
 girls.
 And
 so


to
 say
 that
 he
 was
 running
 a
 vast


compromat
 operation,
 I
 think
 ascribes


too
 much
 intention
 to
 what's
 really


happening
 here.
 And
 the
 reason
 why
 I'm


being
 intentional
 in
 my
 language
 is
 that


what
 he
 clearly
 was
 doing
 was
 recruiting


and
 running
 this
 like
 vast
 massage


scheme
 also
 involving
 Gain
 Maxwell
 all


across
 the
 world,
 Russian
 and
 Eastern


European
 women,
 but
 also
 that
 this


behavior
 was
 tolerated
 in
 some
 cases


seen
 by
 a
 vast
 number
 of
 the
 global


elite.
 Now,
 the
 2007
 circumstances
 of


the
 nonprosecution
 agreement,
 you
 know,


and
 Michael
 and
 I
 could
 go
 back
 on
 this


uh
 forward
 a
 long
 time
 as
 to
 the


circumstances
 of
 which
 that
 arose.


However,
 I
 don't
 think
 Michael,
 you


would
 even
 deny
 that
 his
 access
 to


wealth,
 power,
 and
 money
 did
 eventually


allow
 him
 to
 get
 off
 with
 the
 2007


nonprosecution
 agreement
 and
 the


eventual
 sweetheart
 deal
 uh
 that
 he
 gets


with
 his
 hiring.
 I
 wouldn't
 agree
 with


that,
 actually.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't


think
 the
 average
 Joe
 can
 just
 hire
 Ken


Star
 and
 uh
 private
 investigators
 and


lawyers
 to
 tell
 some
 of
 the


>> Oh,
 sure.
 I
 mean,
 his
 vast
 wealth


enables
 him
 to
 secure
 very
 high
 power


legal
 represent
 representation.


>> That's
 what
 I'm
 claiming.
 This
 whole


concept
 of
 a
 sweetheart
 deal
 is
 a
 total


canar
 that


Brown.


>> Michael,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 off
 on
 that


yet,
 but
 just
 go
 back
 to
 my
 original


question
 of
 what
 is
 your
 30,000
 ft
 take


on
 what
 this
 story
 is
 about?
 Who
 was


this
 guy
 in
 your
 view?


>> I
 will
 answer
 that.
 However,
 I
 do
 want


to
 just
 stipulate
 upfront
 that
 I
 think


this
 reflex
 to
 have
 to
 offer
 some
 kind


of
 totalistic


assessment
 of
 who
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 was


at,
 his
 very
 essence
 has
 fed
 into
 so


much
 of
 the
 constant
 churn
 of


algorithmic
 slop
 that
 has
 generated
 this


hysterical
 frenzy
 around
 this
 issue
 and


has
 led
 to
 people
 being
 totally
 deluded


about
 what
 we're
 even
 talking
 about.


What
 do
 most
 people
 I
 I
 I
 have
 some


surmises
 about
 Jeffrey
 Epsteine.
 He


definitely
 was
 a
 money
 manager
 who,
 as


you
 mentioned,
 was
 sort
 of
 like
 this


Zelig
 character
 who
 did
 have
 an


extraordinary
 cross-section
 of


connections
 with
 people
 from
 across


fields.
 And,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 was


looking
 through
 some
 of
 these
 records
 in


the
 new
 Epstein
 Files
 Productions,
 and
 I


was
 looking
 for
 something
 else,
 but


there
 are
 there's
 an
 archive
 of
 these


old
 message
 pads
 that
 he
 had
 at
 his
 Palm


Beach
 house


>> and
 I'm
 scrolling
 through
 and
 it
 turns


out
 Holly
 Berry
 left
 him
 a
 couple
 of


messages.
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 that
 Holly
 Berry


was
 ever
 in
 contact
 with
 Jeffrey


Epstein.
 So
 you
 can
 always
 find
 somebody


new
 and
 novel
 who
 apparently
 had
 a
 one


dealing
 or
 another
 with
 him.
 But
 why
 are


we
 talking
 about
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 right


now
 in
 February
 of
 2026


>> because
 PE
 he
 is
 believed
 to
 have
 been


the
 most
 prolific
 child
 sex
 trafficker


in
 American
 or
 perhaps
 world
 history


which
 is
 why
 this
 issue
 might
 now
 take


down
 the
 British
 government.
 It's


embroiling
 Norway.
 A
 minister
 in


Slovakia
 had
 to
 resign
 over
 it.
 There's


a
 new
 criminal
 investigation
 that
 was


just
 launched
 in
 France,
 etc.
 That's


what
 people
 conceive
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 to


have
 been.
 And
 that
 whole
 notion
 is


based
 on
 just
 an
 onslaught
 of


mythological
 nonsense
 that's
 pumped
 out


daily
 by
 these
 YouTube
 shows,
 I
 won't


mention
 names,
 podcasts,
 etc.,
 social


media
 personalities
 who
 are
 driven
 by


these
 perverse
 algorithmic
 incentives
 to


be
 totally
 divorced
 from
 the
 facts.


foreground
 this
 rampant
 speculation
 that


ties
 in
 the
 Mossad,
 ties
 in
 unnamed


other
 intelligence
 agencies
 with
 this


presumed


implication
 or
 this
 presumed
 uh
 reality


that
 of
 course
 we
 know
 for
 sure
 that


Jeffrey
 Epste
 was
 running
 this
 pedto


crime
 ring
 and
 we
 all
 so
 they
 they


presuppose
 a
 conclusion
 that's
 just
 been


floating
 out
 there
 in
 the
 ether
 thanks


to
 all
 this
 horrendous
 media
 coverage.
 I


think
 this
 is
 the
 worst
 story
 of
 my


adult
 lifetime
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 media


coverage
 and
 it
 implicates
 the


alternative
 media,
 the
 mainstream
 media


and
 everybody
 in
 between.
 It's
 actually


shocking.
 I
 will
 predict
 here
 and
 now


that
 if
 we
 revisit
 this
 issue
 in
 I
 don't


know
 two
 or
 three
 years,
 people
 will


come
 to
 realize
 if
 I
 have
 anything
 to
 do


with
 it
 that
 they
 were
 bamboozled
 on
 a


mass
 scale.
 There's
 genuine
 fraud
 that


has
 been
 rampant
 in
 ter
 the
 journalistic


malfeasants.
 We're
 not
 supposed
 to
 ever


consider
 the
 massive
 financial


incentives
 where
 the
 Epstein
 industry
 is


now
 something
 like
 I've
 estimated
 a


billion
 dollars
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 payouts


that
 have
 been
 given
 to
 purported


victims
 who
 are
 allowed
 to
 just


reimagine
 things
 that
 happened
 to
 them


20
 years
 before
 as
 an
 adult,
 not
 as
 a


child,
 but
 adult
 at
 the
 time
 of
 their


claim
 victimization
 and
 then
 call


themselves
 a
 sex
 trafficking
 victim
 and


then
 they
 can
 secure
 a
 couple
 million


dollars
 tax-free
 from
 JP
 Morgan
 and
 the


media
 will
 hail
 them
 as
 these
 brave


survivors
 without
 doing
 a
 single
 thing


to
 check
 the
 veracity
 of
 any
 of
 their


claims.
 You
 know
 why
 people
 are
 so
 upset


about
 these
 redactions
 in
 the
 Epstein


files?
 And
 I'm
 upset
 too.
 I
 criticized


Thomas
 Massie
 and
 Roana
 for
 the
 language


of
 their
 bill
 that
 they
 crafted,
 the


Epstein
 Files
 Transparency
 Act,
 which


they
 crafted
 in
 concert
 with
 Bradley


Edwards,
 this
 extortionist
 quote
 unquote


victim's
 lawyer
 who's
 made
 a
 killing
 on


this
 issue
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years
 in


conjunction
 with
 David
 Boy,
 another


shyer.
 and
 Bradley
 Edwards
 at
 his
 urging


Roan
 and
 Thomas
 Massie
 put
 in
 this
 giant


carveout
 to
 so-called
 transparency
 and


disclosure
 into
 their
 bill
 such
 that
 the


DOJ
 was
 authorized
 to
 redact
 or
 withhold


or
 conceal
 any
 information
 that
 could
 be


the
 most
 tangentially
 tied
 to
 anything


that's
 quote
 victim
 identifying.
 So,


they've
 been
 arguing
 frantically
 in


federal
 court
 for
 the
 past
 few
 months


that
 they're
 opposed
 to
 the
 disclosure


of
 Epstein
 files
 because
 it's
 going
 to


terrorize
 all
 these
 belleaguered
 women.


I
 don't
 know.
 Do
 you
 think
 that
 maybe
 if


we
 did
 get
 full
 transparency,
 it
 might


disrupt
 this
 sanitized
 quote
 survivor


narrative
 that
 everybody
 pushes
 so


credulously?
 I'll
 just
 give
 you
 one


example
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 on
 for


too
 long
 and
 I
 there's
 so
 many
 uh


threads
 that
 I
 could
 pull
 here
 that
 you


have
 to
 kind
 of
 rein
 me
 in.
 But
 one


narrative
 that
 could
 disrupt
 if
 we


actually
 did
 get
 genuine
 disclosure,


which
 we're
 not.
 And
 in
 fact,
 Edwards
 at


all
 demanded
 that
 the
 entire
 archive
 be


taken
 down
 because
 this
 disclosure
 was


just
 too
 horrendously
 threatening
 to


them.
 We
 would
 maybe
 get
 more
 insight


into
 some
 of
 the
 government
 propaganda


that's
 been
 allowed
 to
 promugate


unchecked.
 Sag,
 I
 wonder
 if
 you've


corrected
 this
 on
 breaking
 points.
 You


can
 let
 me
 know.
 But
 for
 months,


>> people
 politicians
 across
 the
 media
 the


the
 political
 spectrum
 as
 well
 as
 the


media
 at
 large
 have
 unthinkingly


regurgitated
 this
 figure
 that
 there
 were


over
 a
 thousand
 victims
 of
 Jeffrey


Epstein.
 Sometimes
 that
 gets
 upgraded
 to


thousands
 of
 victims.
 That's
 what
 pre
 uh


Primila
 Japal
 said
 at
 the
 Bondi
 hearing


last
 week.
 Ro
 Connor
 constantly
 blurts


out
 this
 whole
 this
 claim
 of
 over
 a


thousand
 survivors.
 And
 this
 is
 based
 on


the
 July
 6th,
 2025
 FBI
 DOJ
 memo
 which


claimed
 that
 they
 after
 a
 review
 of
 the


evidence
 after
 the
 second
 Trump


administration
 came
 in,
 they
 found
 that


over
 1,000
 victims
 were
 quote
 harmed
 by


Epstein.
 So
 they
 used
 this
 very


conspicuous
 conspicuous
 weasel
 wordage


and
 it
 was
 very
 dubious
 to
 me
 the


instant
 I
 read
 it.
 Turns
 out,
 you
 know,


thank
 God
 on
 some
 level
 for
 the
 Epstein


files
 because
 there
 is
 a
 major


revelation
 contained
 therein,
 which
 is


that
 this
 whole
 this
 number
 is
 a
 fraud.


It's
 bogus.
 They
 they
 they
 admit
 in
 FBI


memoranda
 that
 this
 number
 is
 based
 on
 a


total
 of
 purported
 victims,
 the
 majority


of
 whom
 were
 would
 have
 been
 adults
 at


the
 time
 of
 their
 claim
 victimization.


Anyway,
 but
 it
 that
 includes
 the
 family


members
 of
 alleged
 victims
 in
 that
 total


number
 that's
 been
 how
 many
 alleged


victims
 are
 there?


>> Well,
 who
 knows?
 Why
 is
 the
 government


deceiving
 the
 public
 about
 it?
 If
 people


want
 to
 be
 mad
 about


Michael
 tell
 him
 Pam
 Bonnie
 for
 putting


out
 that
 phony
 propagandistic
 figure
 and


then
 have
 it
 be
 repeated
 adnauseium


without
 the
 slightest
 bit
 of
 critical


discernment.


>> Well,
 I
 do,
 Michael.
 I
 think
 we
 can
 at


least
 agree
 that
 Cash
 Patel
 and
 Pam


Bondi
 haven't
 uh
 handled
 this
 all
 that


responsibly
 on
 that
 particular
 issue.


>> Oh,
 oh,
 well,
 I
 mean,
 you're
 asking
 me


to
 correct
 the
 record
 of
 something
 I've


never
 even
 uttered.
 I've
 never
 said
 the


word.


It's
 literally
 not
 something
 that
 I've


ever
 claimed.
 I
 mean,
 I
 do
 think,


Michael,
 uh,
 that
 what
 you
 like
 to
 do
 is


to
 go
 after,
 and
 really,
 I
 think


fundamentally,
 I'm
 not
 even
 sure
 if
 you


would
 reject
 this.
 You
 reject
 the
 idea


of
 victimization,
 that
 post


victimization,
 uh,
 can't
 even
 happen.


And
 I
 also,
 I
 don't
 even
 necessarily


want
 to
 get
 the
 idea
 of
 victimization.
 I


don't
 even
 know
 what
 that
 means.


>> Well,
 you
 reject
 the
 idea
 that
 women


could
 be
 victimized,
 uh,
 let's
 say,
 by


Jeffrey
 Epste,
 manipulated.
 Yes.
 in
 even


if
 some
 cases
 money
 were
 exchanging


hands.
 I
 will
 say,
 by
 the
 way,
 that
 just


paying
 or
 flying
 in
 adult
 women
 from


Eastern
 Europe
 to
 for
 the
 express


purposes
 of
 having
 sex
 is
 a
 crime,
 by


the
 way.
 Sure,
 it's
 not
 underage.


However,
 we
 do
 have
 the
 2007
 draft


indictment
 where
 there
 were
 a
 number
 of


underage
 victims
 that
 were
 mentioned


there
 where
 Epstein
 specifically
 asked
 a


15-year-old
 if
 he
 knows
 anybody
 who's


younger
 uh
 that
 he
 could
 be
 able
 to


recruited.
 And
 so,
 I
 do
 think
 your
 core


contention
 that
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,


he
 was
 a
 quote
 pedophile
 uh
 is


definitely
 illegitimate.
 But
 I
 also


don't
 necessarily
 want
 to
 get
 dragged


into
 the
 victim
 uh
 stuff
 which
 I
 think


that
 you
 are
 fundamentally
 focused
 on


because
 I
 do
 think
 when
 you're
 saying


why
 are
 people
 talking
 about
 this?
 It


confirms
 a
 general
 suspicion
 of
 the
 way


that
 people
 act
 with
 impunity
 at
 the


highest
 levels
 of
 American
 or
 global


society
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 moral


character
 in
 terms
 of
 their
 dealings


let's
 say
 financially
 and
 uh
 you
 know


you
 like
 to
 brush
 across
 this


intelligence
 question.
 I
 actually
 I


would
 love
 for
 you
 to
 be
 able
 to
 just


grapple
 with
 some
 of
 the
 facts,
 you


know,
 necessarily
 just
 related
 today


where
 the
 Israeli
 government
 was


installing
 surveillance
 equipment
 in


Epstein-owned
 apartment
 but
 used
 for
 the


former
 prime
 minister
 of
 Israel,
 Aud


Barack,
 where
 we
 have
 Aud
 Barack
 and


Epstein
 uh
 joking
 questioningly
 about


Mossad
 where
 Epstein
 is
 foying
 1999
 the


CIA
 for
 any
 mention
 of
 himself
 for
 the


very
 dealings
 that
 he
 himself
 had
 with


the
 arms
 dealing
 industry
 in
 the
 1980s


for
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 had
 a
 false


Austrian
 passport
 at
 the
 age
 of
 29
 years


old.
 Austria
 being
 the
 capital
 of
 spies


long
 before
 he
 ever
 became,
 you
 know,


very
 filthy
 rich.
 And
 so,
 Michael,
 I


think
 what
 you're
 obiscating
 is
 a


general
 interest
 in
 the
 story.
 And
 often


that
 what
 you
 try
 to
 do
 is
 find
 the


lowest
 IQ,
 most
 maximalist
 people


talking
 about
 cannibals
 or
 anything
 like


that
 and
 then
 paint
 that
 as
 a


but


I
 barely
 mentioned
 the
 cannibalism


stuff.
 I
 mean,
 of
 course,
 you're
 trying


to
 Yeah,
 you
 paint
 the
 rest
 of
 us
 who


believe,
 let's
 say,
 in
 some
 of
 a
 bigger


part
 of
 this
 story
 as


>> I
 mean,
 if
 you
 believe
 if
 you
 believe


that
 we
 can
 just
 accept
 at
 face
 value


that
 a
 21-year-old
 model
 who
 accepted
 an


invitation
 to
 visit
 Jeffre
 Island
 when


she
 was
 in
 the
 British
 false
 pretenses,


let
 me
 finish
 under
 false
 pretenses
 by


Jean
 Luke
 Brunell.
 And
 you've
 looked


into
 it.
 No,
 it
 had
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


it.
 This
 is
 nonsense.
 I
 mean,
 I'm


>> Tell
 me
 if
 you've
 looked
 into
 what
 I'm


about
 to
 describe.
 Can
 I
 have
 30
 seconds


to
 describe
 it?


>> All right.
 Uh,
 go
 ahead.


>> Lisa
 Phillips,
 who
 was
 one
 of
 the
 women,


quote,
 survivors
 who
 spoke
 at
 these


press
 conferences
 in
 front
 of
 the
 US


capital
 and
 infamously
 declared
 that
 she


and
 her
 fellow
 survivors
 were
 going
 to


create
 their
 own
 list
 of
 Epstein
 clients


and
 then
 hand
 it
 over
 to
 Marjorie
 Taylor


Green
 and
 Thomas
 Massie
 so
 they
 could


read
 it
 out
 on
 the
 floor
 of
 the
 House
 of


Representatives
 under
 the
 protections
 of


the
 speech
 and
 debate
 clause
 and
 caused


a
 giant
 media
 firestorm.
 As
 I
 don't
 have


to
 remind
 you,
 her
 whole
 tale
 of


victimization
 is
 that
 at
 age
 21
 as
 a


professional
 model,
 she
 was
 on
 a
 photo


shoot
 in
 the
 British
 Virgin
 Islands.


Another
 girl,
 you
 know,
 or
 young
 woman


that
 she
 was
 with
 invited
 her
 to
 take
 a


ferry
 to
 Jeffrey
 Epstein's
 island
 in
 the


US
 Virgin
 Islands.
 She
 accepted.
 She


never
 claimed
 victimization
 for
 likeif


or
 20
 years.
 She's
 on
 a
 podcast
 in
 2020


saying,
 "Gee
 whiz,
 I
 never
 heard


anything
 about
 all
 this
 crazy
 Epstein


stuff,
 but
 I
 knew
 him
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 know


what
 went
 happened
 there."
 Then
 all
 of a


sudden,
 JP
 Morgan
 opens
 its
 floodgates


for
 settlements
 of,
 you
 know,
 $290


million.
 You
 know,
 I
 know
 like
 we're
 not


supposed
 to
 acknowledge
 human
 nature


about
 what
 that
 can
 incentivize
 on
 this


particular
 subject.
 I
 mean,
 explain
 that


to
 me.
 And
 she
 now
 claims
 that
 we're


supposed
 to
 just
 take
 her
 to
 be
 a


survivor.
 She
 was
 the
 one
 one
 of
 the


women
 who
 also
 stood
 up
 and
 protested


Pam
 Bondi
 last
 week.
 So
 yes,
 Sager,
 if


you
 do
 take
 at
 face
 value
 that
 that


person
 can
 be
 rightly
 designated
 as
 a


victim
 and
 fuel
 and
 fment
 this
 giant


worldwide
 pedophilia
 crisis
 that
 we're


supposedly
 in
 the
 midst
 of,
 then
 I
 don't


know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 consider
 you
 to
 have
 a


pretty
 high
 IQ
 and
 that's
 just
 not
 some


like
 random
 on
 social
 media
 talking


about
 cannibals.
 So
 you
 tell
 me
 if
 you


agree
 that
 that's
 a
 legitimate
 case
 of


victimization
 and
 it
 should
 be
 just
 on


the
 classic
 example
 of
 selecting


somebody.
 Look,
 I'm
 not
 here
 to
 defend


every
 so-called
 Epstein
 victim.
 Because,


by
 the
 way,
 I
 think
 that
 what
 you
 do


very
 expertly
 is
 finding
 people
 like


Lisa
 Phillips
 and
 then
 trying
 to
 portray


all
 of
 them
 of
 that
 sort.
 Like,
 would


you
 deny
 that
 vast
 wire
 transfers
 were


sent
 to
 Eastern
 Europe
 to
 fly
 in
 women


for
 the
 express
 purposes
 of
 sex?
 Because


that
 is
 women.
 Okay.
 Is
 that
 not
 a


crime,
 Michael?
 Have
 you
 Googled
 the
 man


act?
 I
 mean
 for
 somebody
 who
 has


actually
 looked
 into
 prostitution
 I
 mean


this
 is
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about
 is
 that


by
 the
 way
 also
 you
 have
 not
 yet


grappled
 with
 the
 2007
 draft
 indictment


there
 okay
 I
 mean
 look
 I
 have


unfortunately
 very
 limited
 amount
 of


time
 out
 for
 that


hold
 on
 guys
 so
 told
 us
 um
 up
 front
 that


he
 only
 had
 half
 an
 hour
 so
 okay


>> you
 know
 we
 don't
 have
 that
 much
 time


listen
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 a
 couple
 other


questions
 and
 then
 once
 leaves
 Michael


we
 can
 get
 you
 to
 say
 what
 you
 want
 to


say
 I
 want
 to
 go
 to
 the
 less
 waxner


deposition
 the
 other
 day.
 What
 did
 we


learn
 from
 that
 specifically
 about
 how


Epstein
 got
 his
 start?
 I
 do
 think
 that


there
 are
 these
 questions
 about
 again


who
 this
 guy
 was,
 how
 did
 he
 accumulate


hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 so
 early


in
 his
 career?
 How
 did
 he
 seem
 to
 um


obtain
 all
 these
 different
 uh


connections
 specifically
 to
 the


intelligence
 world?
 Did
 any
 of
 that
 get


resolved?
 And
 what
 what's
 your
 take
 on


that?


>> No,
 David,
 it
 wasn't
 resolved.


Unfortunately,
 the
 entire
 transcript
 is


not
 public.
 What
 we
 do
 know
 from
 the


House
 Oversight
 Committee,
 at least


what's
 been
 released
 now
 so
 far
 is


Leslie
 Wexner
 said
 he
 was
 never


questioned
 ever
 once
 by
 the
 FBI
 or
 the


Department
 of
 Justice
 involving
 this


case.
 I
 will
 say
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


track
 record
 of
 Leslie
 Wexner,
 it's


incredibly
 bizarre.
 He
 claims
 that


Epstein
 was
 a
 con
 man
 who
 stole
 his


money
 for
 decades.
 In
 1991,
 we
 had
 the


power
 of
 attorney
 that
 was
 signed
 over


to
 him.
 He
 claims
 that
 Epstein
 was
 a


financial
 genius
 and
 a
 wizard.
 We
 have


the
 transferring
 of
 the
 town
 home
 which


eventually
 there
 was
 some
 payment
 uh


that
 was
 reconciled
 uh
 on
 the
 back
 end.


But
 an
 incredible
 amount
 of
 control
 that


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 had
 over
 Leslie
 Wexner's


finances
 over
 the
 Wexner
 Foundation


which
 he
 used
 to
 funnel
 money
 to
 Aud


Barack
 the
 former
 prime
 minister
 of


Israel
 support
 many
 Zionist
 causes
 under


the
 Wexner
 Foundation
 including
 the


Wexner
 Fellowship
 currently
 at
 Harvard


University.
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 important


for
 us
 to
 explore
 some
 more
 of
 that.


There's
 some
 very
 odd
 dealings
 with
 the


beginnings
 of
 their
 relationship.


Previous
 Epstein
 associates
 have


testified
 that
 in
 1992,
 which
 is
 shortly


after
 power
 of
 attorney
 and
 all
 of
 that


uh
 was
 acquired
 or
 the
 relationship,


sorry,
 between
 Epstein
 and
 Wexner
 began,


is
 that
 much
 of
 Epstein's
 lifestyle


exploded.
 Wexner
 does
 not
 even
 dispute


uh
 that
 Epstein
 had
 vast
 control
 over


his
 finances
 and
 even
 claims
 that
 he
 was


stolen
 from
 by
 Jeffrey
 Epste
 that
 their


uh
 relationship
 is
 supposed
 to
 have


ended
 sometime
 I
 think
 in
 2007
 but
 he


has
 not
 yet
 answered
 questions
 about


this
 relationship
 in
 an
 open
 public


forum
 beyond
 some
 statements
 and
 he


currently
 did
 issue
 an
 opening
 statement


for
 the
 record.
 I
 personally
 would
 like


to
 see
 the
 release
 of
 that
 transcript.
 I


mean
 all
 for
 transparency
 here
 in
 this


particular
 case.
 He's
 an
 88-year-old
 man


and
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 genuinely
 bizarre.


Oh,
 and
 not
 to
 even
 mention
 the
 modeling


uh
 industry
 uh
 which
 you
 know
 ep
 which


Wexner
 himself
 was
 involved
 with
 and


there's
 several
 emails
 including


Wexner's
 own
 crude
 drawing
 in
 the


Epstein
 birthday
 book
 involving
 boobs


that
 he
 said
 that's
 all
 Epstein
 ever


wanted.
 So
 there
 be
 their
 relationship


is
 bizarre
 goes
 back
 decades.
 Wexner


maintains
 as
 I
 said
 that
 he
 was
 conned


and
 that
 he
 was
 stolen
 from.
 I
 don't


really
 believe
 much
 of
 that
 story.
 Uh,


Michael,
 you
 and
 I
 have
 now
 read


thousands
 of
 Epstein
 emails.
 There's
 no


sophisticated
 financial
 instruments


going
 on.
 Uh,
 even
 back
 to
 the
 very


beginnings
 of
 Jeffrey
 Epstein's
 claims


here
 about
 managing
 money.
 Almost
 none


of
 it
 passes
 the
 smelter.
 David,
 you're


a
 very
 high
 net
 worth
 individual.
 You


can
 go
 to
 Goldbin
 Sachs
 or
 many
 other


financial
 houses
 and
 get
 teams
 of
 people


to
 manage
 money
 for
 sophisticated
 uh,


financial
 instruments
 and
 others
 not


available
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 us.
 be
 very
 odd


for
 you
 to
 turn
 over
 your
 finances
 to
 to


Jeffrey
 Epstein.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 he
 he
 began
 his
 career,
 I


guess,
 at
 Bear
 Sterns.
 I
 guess
 it
 was
 a


brief
 stint
 where
 he
 worked
 I
 guess
 he


one
 of
 the
 curious
 things
 about
 him
 is


he
 dropped
 out
 of
 college
 around
 age
 20.


>> I
 guess
 he
 was
 studying
 math.
 He
 then


was
 a
 teacher
 at
 the
 Dalton
 School
 for


like
 a
 year,


>> correct?


>> And
 then
 he
 worked
 at
 Bear
 Sterns
 for


four
 years.


>> He
 met
 Ace
 Greenberg
 through
 the
 Dalton


School.
 Greenberg's
 I
 think
 it
 was
 it


was
 either
 one
 of
 his
 children
 uh
 was


there
 and
 then
 he
 went
 to
 Bear
 Sterns.


He's
 fired
 from
 Beer
 Sterns
 after
 a


couple
 of
 years
 and
 that's
 when
 his


descent
 into
 what
 I
 call
 like
 the


darkness
 his
 expertise
 in


moneyaundering.
 I
 believe
 that
 that's


when
 it
 was
 honed
 as
 reflects
 in
 the


record
 and
 the
 testimony
 of
 the
 people


who
 dealt
 with
 him
 there
 at
 the
 time


including
 the
 false
 passport
 Iran


contour
 arm
 smuggling
 and
 all
 of
 that


that
 I've
 laid
 out.


>> S
 can
 I
 ask
 you
 a
 quick
 question
 because


I
 know
 you
 have
 to
 go
 soon.
 I'm
 I'm


honestly
 curious
 if
 you
 would
 agree
 with


the
 statement
 from
 Thomas
 Massie.
 This


is
 from


>> Okay.
 February
 16th,
 he
 says,
 quote,


"We're
 exposing
 the
 extent
 of
 Epstein's


global
 pedophile
 ring
 and
 how
 it
 touches


our
 government
 and
 aristocracy."
 So,
 do


you
 think
 it's
 a
 factually
 valid


statement
 that
 what
 we
 know
 to
 have


taken
 place
 and
 maybe
 even
 is
 still


ongoing
 is
 a
 quote
 global
 pedophile


ring?
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 when
 what
 you're


asking
 about
 a
 global
 pedophile
 ring,
 it


was
 well,
 sorry,


>> this
 is
 Thomas
 Massie
 saying


>> Thomas
 Massie,
 a
 global
 pedophile
 ring


is
 a
 ring
 of
 global
 elites
 who
 seemed


aware
 and
 perhaps
 participated
 in
 the


abuse
 of
 underage
 children.
 Now,


Michael,
 I
 will
 grant
 you
 this
 and
 what


I
 respect.
 Well,
 no,
 I
 will
 grant
 you


this.
 What
 I
 think
 you
 do
 well
 is
 to


parse
 the
 actual
 individual
 claim
 of


many
 of
 the
 victims
 and
 others
 that
 are


out
 there.
 And
 I
 actually
 think
 you
 have


a
 great
 role
 in
 this
 ecosystem
 for


debunking
 especially
 some
 of
 the
 lowest


IQ
 content
 which
 is
 out
 there
 like
 you


did
 with
 the
 torture
 video.
 So
 I
 do
 want


to
 appreciate
 you
 for
 doing
 that.


>> That
 was
 low
 hanging
 fruit.
 I
 mean
 I


don't
 I
 don't
 really
 appreciate
 this


idea
 that
 I
 only
 focus
 on
 low
 IQ
 social


media
 blushia


of
 all
 this
 sag.


>> Yes,
 I
 know
 you
 have.
 Jeffrey
 Epste
 is


just
 casually
 called
 a
 pedophile


virtually
 everywhere
 in
 the
 media
 and


among
 every
 politician
 much
 of
 your
 what


he
 is
 nobody
 thought
 because
 he
 would


like
 to
 pre
 post
 pubar


don't
 you
 find
 it
 bizarre
 that
 for
 all


the
 enormous
 media
 resources
 that
 have


been
 poured
 into
 this
 story
 over
 the


past
 however
 many
 years
 among
 by


newspapers
 magazines
 podcast
 specials


you
 name
 it
 I
 guess
 I'm
 the
 only
 one
 who


ever
 thought
 to
 actually
 go
 into
 the


Florida
 court
 document
 and
 pull
 up
 the


transcript
 of
 the
 plea
 hearing
 in
 June


of
 2008
 when
 he
 entered
 his
 two
 guilty


pleas


for
 two
 state
 level
 prostitution
 charges


and
 he's
 called
 a
 convicted
 pedophile


adnauseium.
 It
 turns
 out
 the
 sole
 minor


victim
 who
 was
 cited
 in
 that
 plea


hearing
 as
 the
 sole
 minor
 to
 whom
 he


procured
 for
 prostitution
 was
 literally


17
 years
 old.
 Yes,
 Michael.
 I
 understand


that
 because
 they
 picked
 the
 oldest


person
 in
 the
 indictment
 to
 plead
 guilty


to
 and
 there's
 a
 14
 15year-old
 which
 is


named
 in
 the
 2007
 draft
 indictment
 which


was
 released.
 Michael,
 you're
 focusing
 I


I
 am
 focusing
 on
 a
 federal
 document.
 Uh


there's
 a
 federal
 document
 which


specifically
 alleges
 a
 14
 and
 15year-old


who
 are
 abusing
 including
 asking
 a


15year-old
 if
 there
 is
 this
 2007
 draft.


You
 have
 read
 it.
 You're
 going
 to
 take


as
 dispositive.


>> Well,
 I
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 Okay.


Unfortunately,
 it
 was
 never
 uh
 never


contested
 because
 of
 the
 plea
 agreement


which
 eventually
 came
 forward.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 you're
 using
 the
 same
 tactic
 Alan


Dersowitz
 did
 in
 his
 defense.


Unfortunately,
 I
 have
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


Dersuits
 or
 I
 don't
 share
 his
 tactical


maneuver.


>> I
 unfortunately
 have
 to
 take
 my
 child
 to


a
 doctor's
 appointment
 as
 I
 flagged
 uh


to
 do
 uh
 and
 uh
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 this


entire
 thing.
 And
 I
 do


>> I
 think
 you'd
 be
 operating
 in
 good
 faith


as
 well.
 Sager
 for
 the
 most
 part
 unlike


a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 have
 glombmed
 onto


this
 story
 and
 you're
 willing
 to
 you


know
 engage
 on
 the
 substance.
 So
 that


again
 is
 appreciated
 by
 me
 and
 you
 know


whenever
 you'd
 like
 to
 engage
 further


I'm
 always
 available.


>> All
 right
 Michael
 uh
 thank
 you
 David
 for


the
 invitation.


>> Yes.
 Thank
 you
 for
 coming
 Saga.


Appreciate
 it.
 All
 right.
 So
 Michael
 let


me
 kind
 of
 reset
 here.


>> Okay.
 I'm
 I'm
 not
 sure
 you've
 had
 a


chance
 to
 kind
 of
 lay
 out
 your
 case
 for


what
 you
 called
 Epstein
 mythology.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 I
 want
 to
 give
 you
 a
 chance
 to
 kind


of
 just
 lay
 out
 your
 thesis
 here
 that


what's
 happening
 is
 actually
 a
 type
 of


moral
 panic
 or
 feeding
 frenzy,
 a
 type
 of


hysteria.
 You've
 compared
 it
 to
 the


Salem
 witch
 trials.


>> Yeah.


>> There
 was
 also
 the
 case
 in
 the
 1980s
 of


the
 whole
 day
 child
 abuse.


>> Satanic
 panic.
 the
 satanic


>> where
 I
 think
 hundreds
 of
 people
 went
 to


jail
 or
 were
 prosecuted
 for
 that.
 It


turned
 out


>> I
 don't know
 if
 it
 was
 hundreds
 but
 more


than
 enough
 to
 make
 it
 a
 extreme


miscarriage
 of
 justice.


>> So
 that's
 the
 comparison
 you've
 made.
 So


I
 guess
 I
 want
 to
 let
 you
 lay
 out
 that


case
 in
 a
 clear
 way
 cuz
 I'm
 not
 sure


that
 you've
 had
 a
 chance
 to
 quite
 do


that
 yet.


>> I
 mean
 I
 definitely
 laid
 out
 my
 case
 on


this
 score
 in
 many
 other
 venues
 and
 on


many
 other
 occasions
 but
 I
 guess
 not
 on


this
 particular
 podcast
 yet.
 So,
 I'm


happy
 to
 sketch
 it
 out.
 In
 terms
 of
 the


satanic
 panic
 parallel,
 that's
 not
 one


that
 I
 would
 have
 necessarily
 been
 most


inclined
 to
 bring
 up
 until
 recently
 just


because
 there's
 now
 this
 new
 layer
 of


the
 mythology
 that's
 added
 been
 added


with
 the
 production
 of
 these
 Epstein


quote
 files
 where
 people
 are
 reading


snippets
 of
 emails
 to
 signify
 some
 kind


of
 coded
 messaging
 around
 cannibalism
 or


around
 grotesque
 child
 sacrifice.
 that


really
 wasn't
 a
 hallmark
 of
 the
 Epstein


story
 so
 much
 before
 this
 enormous
 tunch


of
 emails
 were
 released.
 And
 it
 relates


to
 the
 satanic
 panic
 frenzy
 in
 so
 far
 as


claims
 around
 such
 things
 as
 like
 truly


grotesque
 child
 sacrifice,


mutilation
 of
 infants,
 you
 know,
 bathing


toddlers
 in
 blood.
 Like
 all
 the
 most


nightmarish
 scenarios
 you
 could
 possibly


dream
 up
 were
 alleged
 in
 the
 1980s


and
 taken
 deadly
 seriously
 by
 the


authorities
 resulting
 in
 as
 you
 alluded


to
 a
 good
 number
 of
 people
 actually


being
 thrown
 in
 prison
 for
 many
 years


and
 it
 was
 turn
 it
 was
 found
 to
 be
 just


a
 gigantic
 hoax.
 Um,
 but
 maybe
 a
 more


apt
 parallel
 that
 also
 would
 have
 been


apt
 even
 before
 this
 latest
 record


production
 is
 that


the
 satanic
 panic
 frenzy
 of
 the
 1980s


was
 ultimately
 concluded
 to
 have


originated
 really
 with
 one
 woman
 who
 was


just
 straightforwardly
 mentally
 ill,


delusional,
 needed
 to
 essentially
 be


institutionalized.
 And
 yet
 she
 would


make
 claims
 about
 sex
 child
 sex
 abuse


that
 the
 authorities
 countenanced
 or


gave
 credence
 to.
 And
 there's
 a
 similar


thing
 going
 on
 with
 the
 Epstein


mythology.
 Now,
 when
 I
 mention
 the


Epstein
 mythology,
 I'm
 not
 talking
 about


the
 2007208


Florida
 nonprosecution
 agreement
 or
 that


whole
 scenario
 that
 Sager
 brought
 up
 in


peace
 meal
 before.
 That's
 a
 different


element
 of
 this
 whole
 story.
 The


mythology
 developed
 later,
 mostly
 around


2014
 with
 the
 introduction
 of
 these
 new


claims
 by
 Virginia
 Roberts
 Guay
 and
 her


lawyers
 Bradley
 Edwards,
 Paul
 Cassell,


later
 David
 Boy
 in
 which
 she
 alleged


that
 she
 had
 been
 child
 sex
 traffked


around
 the
 world
 and
 that
 she
 knew
 that


Epstein
 enforced
 this
 child
 sex


trafficking
 operation
 via
 blackmail.
 And


also
 she
 made
 specific
 allegations


against
 three
 particular
 individuals.


Alan
 Dersowitz,
 Prince
 Andrew,
 John
 Luke


Brunell,
 and
 then
 also
 she
 accused
 a


generic
 category
 of
 other
 high-profile


trial
 persons
 who
 she
 didn't
 specify
 as


also
 victimizing
 her
 like
 prime


ministers
 and
 um
 uh
 politicians
 and


presidents
 and
 so
 forth.
 Um,
 so
 that's


the
 basically
 the
 origin
 of
 what
 I
 would


call
 the
 mythology,
 which


is
 just
 sort
 of
 a
 different
 order
 or


magnitude
 than
 the
 initial
 Palm
 Beach


prosecution,
 which
 was
 effectively
 a


local
 crime.
 But
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 mythol,


the
 parallel
 to
 the
 satanic
 panic,


Virginia
 Roberts
 Kufra
 was
 a
 profoundly


disturbed
 mentally
 unwell
 person
 who
 was


validated
 and
 legitimized
 and
 now


continues
 to
 be
 celebrated
 as
 some
 kind


of
 martyr
 for
 truth.
 Even
 though
 if


anybody
 had
 used
 a
 lick
 of
 discernment


about
 as
 to
 her
 claims,
 it
 would
 have


been
 found
 that
 she
 could
 not
 be
 treated


so
 credulously.
 maybe
 she
 needed
 some


help,
 but
 this
 idea
 that
 she
 would
 be


the
 basis
 for
 this
 global
 scandal
 that's


rocking
 all
 these
 countries
 is
 just


outrageous.
 And
 there
 are
 two
 others
 who


are
 fundament
 two
 other
 mentally
 ill


women.
 And
 I
 don't
 say
 that
 even
 to
 be


pjorative
 or
 derogatory
 at
 all.
 It's


just
 objectively
 true.
 If
 you
 take
 a


look,
 Maria
 Farmer
 is
 one
 of
 these
 other


definitely
 mentally
 ill
 persons
 who,
 for


example,
 introduced
 or
 was
 integral
 in


introducing
 this
 idea
 that
 Epstein
 had


cameras
 set
 up
 in
 all
 his
 bedrooms
 and


bathrooms
 and
 was
 surreptitiously


recording
 prominent
 people
 so
 he
 could


use
 it
 for
 blackmail.
 And
 then
 another


one,
 Sarah
 Ransom,
 was
 one
 of
 the
 people


who
 spurred
 the
 mythology
 in
 large
 part


around
 the
 island.
 So
 she
 came
 to
 claim


after
 going
 through
 several
 mental


health
 crisis
 that
 she
 had
 been


systematically
 raped
 at
 the
 island
 even


though
 when
 she
 actually
 had
 to


eventually
 give
 a
 deposition.
 She
 really


described
 nothing
 of
 the
 sort.
 She
 was


also
 an
 adult
 when
 she
 went
 to
 the


island
 voluntarily
 and
 she
 described


what
 it
 was
 effectively
 a
 se
 a


consensual
 you
 know
 minor
 sexual


encounter
 with
 Epstein
 but
 she


dramatized
 it
 radically
 in
 the
 wake
 and


people
 don't
 know
 I
 mean
 David
 do
 you


did
 you
 know
 this
 or
 does
 anybody
 know


that
 there
 in
 the
 public
 know
 that


despite
 everybody
 and
 their
 mother


including
 like
 Rokan
 and
 Thomas
 Massie


at
 all
 declaring
 that
 the
 Epstein


property
 in
 the
 US
 Virgin
 Islands
 the


private
 island
 that
 it's
 rape
 island
 or


pedophile
 island
 that
 there's
 never
 been


a
 credible
 allegation
 of
 rape
 ever


discovered
 that
 that
 take
 that
 took


place
 on
 that
 island.
 Like
 is
 that
 well


known
 or
 am
 I
 crazy?


>> No,
 it's
 not
 well
 known.
 The
 only
 reason


I
 knew
 is
 because
 I've
 heard
 you
 on
 a


couple
 of
 podcasts.
 So,
 I
 thought
 it
 was


important
 to
 get
 you
 on
 as
 a


counterpoint.
 So,
 just
 with
 respect
 to


these
 three
 women,
 they
 did
 go
 to
 the


island.
 Is
 is
 that
 true?


>> Sarah
 Ransom
 did.


>> Okay.


>> Um
 Maria
 Farmer,
 no.
 Maria
 Farmer
 is
 the


one
 who
 purported
 that
 she
 was
 actually


the
 original
 Epstein
 accuser
 and
 she
 was


this
 great
 hero
 whistleblower
 because


she
 tried
 to
 sound
 the
 alarm
 way
 before


all
 these
 other
 females
 were
 abused.
 She


claims
 that
 in
 1996


after
 she
 had
 been
 a
 25-year-old


employee
 of
 Epstein's
 who
 basically
 sat


at
 his
 front
 desk
 in
 his
 New
 York


townhouse
 that
 she
 was
 invited
 and


accepted
 uh
 to
 go
 to
 the
 Ohio
 compound


of
 Lexley
 Wexner
 to
 be
 an
 artist
 and


residence
 of
 sorts
 because
 she
 was
 a


paint
 a
 painter.
 And
 then
 she
 claimed


that
 over
 the
 course
 of
 her
 interactions


with
 Epstein
 and
 Maxwell,
 she
 ended
 up


filing
 a
 first
 an
 attempted
 police


report
 and
 then
 went
 to
 the
 FBI.
 And
 she


never
 really
 specified
 what
 it
 is
 that


she
 claimed
 that
 she
 reported
 to
 the
 FBI


with
 any
 clarity.
 But
 she
 told
 this
 tale


about
 how
 Epstein
 had
 supposedly
 stolen


these
 photographs
 that
 she
 had
 produced


of
 her
 younger
 sisters
 who
 were
 below


the
 age
 of
 18
 so
 that
 she
 could
 use


those
 photographs
 to
 paint
 paintings
 of


her
 younger
 sisters
 in
 the
 nude.
 Now,
 I


don't know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 that's
 a


confession
 to
 production
 of
 child


pornography,
 but
 technically
 speaking,


but
 you
 know,
 um,
 but
 that's
 what
 she


claimed.
 And
 then
 she
 also
 added
 that


she
 had
 been
 sexually
 assaulted
 or


abused
 or
 raped
 by
 both
 Epstein
 and


Maxwell.
 And
 somehow
 over
 the
 course
 of


that
 assault
 at
 age
 26,
 she
 had
 like
 a


divine
 revelation
 literally
 and
 realized


that
 they
 were
 both
 pedophiles.
 This
 is


how
 she
 recounted
 it
 years
 after
 the


fact.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 police
 that


FBI
 intake
 report
 or
 the
 complaint
 that


was
 memorialized
 that
 has
 come
 out
 in


terms
 of
 the
 what
 was
 contemporaneously


documented,
 she
 mentions
 nothing
 about
 a


sexual
 assault.
 She
 mentions
 nothing


about
 any
 kind
 of
 sex
 crime
 at
 all.
 She


simply
 claims
 that
 these
 photos
 of
 hers


were
 stolen
 and
 there's
 never
 been
 any


evidence
 that
 those
 photos
 were
 actually


stolen.
 So
 that's
 one
 person
 and
 she's


come
 these
 and
 these
 three
 women
 ransom


farmer
 uh
 Roberts
 Guay
 were
 all
 integral


in
 different
 dimensions
 of
 the


mythology.
 They
 were
 incredibly


important
 named
 plaintiffs
 in
 critical


litigation.
 They,
 you
 know,
 criminal


investigations
 were
 launched
 based
 on


the
 basis
 of
 her
 their
 claims
 in
 various


respects.
 And
 they're
 all
 just


profoundly
 mentally
 ill,
 erratic,
 and


wholly
 unreliable
 to
 the
 degree
 that
 if


we're
 going to
 have
 a
 international


pedophilic
 mass
 hysteria
 narrative


that's
 at
 all
 predicated
 on
 their


claims,
 then
 we've
 entered
 into
 a


fantasy
 land
 because
 it
 will
 never
 in


the
 future
 hold
 up
 to
 any
 kind
 of


rational
 re-evaluation
 or
 scrutiny
 at


all.


>> Okay.
 So,
 Robert
 Scufrey
 or
 VRG
 as
 as
 I


think
 you've
 called
 her
 in
 your


Substack.


>> Yeah.


>> When
 did
 she
 come
 forward
 with
 her?


>> Yeah.


>> Her
 story


>> cuz
 I
 she
 was
 the
 basis
 of
 that
 Netflix


movie
 or
 documentary


>> called
 Filthy
 Rich
 about
 about
 Epstein.


You
 were
 saying
 that
 that
 happened


>> after
 the
 whole
 2008
 Palm
 Beach.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I'll
 I'll
 explain.
 by
 the
 way,


Filthy
 Rich,
 which
 uh
 o
 over
 this
 past


summer
 when
 the
 Epstein
 furer
 kind
 of


got
 reignited,
 it
 like
 skyrocketed
 to


like
 the
 one
 of
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 top


of
 the
 charts
 on
 Netflix
 once
 again.
 So


that
 little
 piece
 of
 commercial


commercial
 propaganda
 has
 been
 very


determinative
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 people


have
 had
 their
 perception
 shaped
 of
 this


issue.
 And
 it
 is
 like
 literal
 propaganda


I
 would
 argue
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 it
 was


concocted
 as
 a
 PR
 vehicle
 for
 the
 victim


quote
 unquote
 victims
 and
 especially


their
 lawyers
 to
 create
 like
 a
 public


clamor
 for
 some
 kind
 of
 remedial
 action


to
 be
 taken
 against
 um
 Epstein's


co-conspirators
 or
 more
 more
 relevantly


his
 estate.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 a
 maneuver.
 It


was
 a
 PR
 maneuver
 by
 a
 legal
 team
 who


worked
 alongside
 the
 producers
 of
 that


documentary
 as
 has
 as
 have
 been
 so
 much


of
 the
 mass
 market
 entertainment


products
 that
 have
 been
 produced
 around


the
 Epstein
 affair.
 It's
 only
 taken
 from


that
 one
 perspective
 of
 the
 purported


victims
 and
 that
 perspective
 is
 shaped


very
 carefully
 by
 their
 lawyers
 to


create
 this
 sanitized
 survivor
 narrative


that
 is
 now
 the
 predominant
 one.
 But
 in


terms
 of
 her
 origins,
 yes,
 she
 um
 she


initially
 filed
 some
 civil
 litigation


around


I
 want
 to
 say
 ' 09
 2010
 maybe
 08
 as
 a


Jane
 Doe


um
 maybe
 2011
 somewhere
 in
 that
 range
 as


first
 as
 a
 Jane
 Doe
 meaning
 she
 wasn't


named
 in
 the
 litigation
 and
 this
 related


to
 a
 period
 of
 around


2001
 2002
 when
 she
 was
 in
 the
 Epstein


orbit
 to
 some
 extent.
 And
 there's


there's
 evidence
 that
 she
 was
 in
 the


Epstein
 orbit
 to
 some
 extent.
 She's
 not


hallucinating
 everything.
 I've
 argued


that
 I
 would
 she's
 not
 so
 much
 a
 liar.
 I


wouldn't
 say
 like
 I've
 never
 directly


accused
 her
 of
 lying
 about
 anything
 as


such.
 I've
 called
 I've
 said
 that
 she's


kind
 of
 confabulated
 an
 alternate


reality.
 And
 that's
 a
 little
 bit


different
 because
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily


conote
 willful
 deceit
 and
 it's
 almost


even
 more
 disturbing
 if
 you
 think
 about


it.
 But


>> what's
 your
 basis
 for
 that?
 The
 big
 one


I
 guess
 is
 that
 in
 your
 view
 that
 she


recanted
 her
 story
 about
 Dersowitz
 or


>> Yeah,
 she
 recanted
 her
 story
 not
 just


about
 Dersitz.
 That's
 maybe
 the
 most


well-known
 instance
 of
 her
 recanting
 one


of
 her
 marquee
 claims
 and
 it
 really
 only


came
 about
 because
 Dersowitz
 was


unusually
 motivated
 to
 actually
 pursue


some
 sort
 of
 resolution
 through
 a
 very


protracted
 litigation
 process
 against


very
 highpowered
 lawyers.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of


the
 fallacies
 here
 is
 that
 these


survivors,
 quote
 unquote,
 such
 as


Virginia,
 are
 taken
 to
 be
 these


bleaguered
 victims,
 etc.,
 who
 had
 no


power
 at
 all
 in
 this
 dynamic,
 and
 yet,
 I


mean,
 they
 were
 represented
 by
 some
 of


the
 most
 powerful
 and
 skillful
 lawyers


in
 the
 country,
 such
 as
 David
 Boyce,


who's
 like
 one
 of
 the
 best
 known
 lawyers


of
 all
 time
 and
 was
 hugely
 wellresourced


and
 also,
 you
 know,
 Virginia
 Guay
 became


incredibly
 wealthy.
 maybe
 not
 as
 wealthy


as
 you,
 David,
 but
 you
 know,
 20


estimates
 range
 from
 like
 15,
 20,
 $25


million.
 It's
 hard
 to
 know
 because
 a
 lot


of the
 settlement
 details
 are
 secret.


Um,
 so
 it
 wasn't
 just
 this
 hless
 victim


who
 had
 nothing,
 no
 leg
 to
 stand
 on
 in


order
 to
 make
 her
 claims,
 but
 yeah,


Durowitz,
 she
 ended
 up
 recanting
 her


allegations.
 And
 bear
 in
 mind,
 it
 wasn't


just
 that
 she,
 you
 know,
 happened
 to


level
 some
 accusation
 at
 some
 point,


maybe
 in
 like
 casual
 banter.


It's
 that
 she
 made
 allegations
 of


herself
 having
 been
 victimized
 by


Dersuit
 sexually
 on
 at least
 six
 or


seven
 occasions.
 And
 she
 described
 each


individual
 instance
 of
 that


victimization
 in
 vivid,
 graphic,
 almost


grotesque
 detail,
 describing
 Dersuit's


body
 parts,
 sexual
 proclivities,
 etc.


And
 she
 did
 this
 in
 sworn
 affidavit
 and


under
 deposition.
 So
 could
 theoretically


even
 be
 subject
 to
 perjury
 charges


should
 a
 prosecutor
 ever
 have
 been


inclined
 to
 bring
 them
 which
 of
 course


they
 wouldn't
 have
 been
 in
 this


environment.
 Um
 and
 but
 it
 goes
 much


further.
 She
 had
 to
 recant
 claims


against
 Harvard
 professor
 Steven
 Klin


who
 she
 claims
 she
 had
 intercourse
 with.


Um,
 she
 recanted
 even
 claims
 against


John
 Luke
 Brunell,
 who's
 another
 sort
 of


actor
 or
 a
 player
 in
 this
 whole
 story


that
 leads
 people
 to
 make
 their


postulations
 about
 there
 being
 this


supposedly
 international
 sex
 trafficking


ring
 because
 he
 was
 like
 a
 modeling


mogul.
 But
 he
 ends
 up
 getting
 arrested


by
 French
 authorities
 under
 pressure


from
 the
 US
 in
 2019
 after
 Epstein


himself
 was
 federally
 indicted
 and


arrested.
 And
 given
 the
 vagaries
 of
 the


French
 legal
 system,
 which
 I
 don't
 fully


comprehend
 still
 in
 relation
 to
 the


United
 States,
 he
 was
 in
 custody
 or


incarcerated
 for
 quite
 a
 long
 time
 prior


to
 any
 formal
 charges
 being
 brought.


Eventually,
 she's
 called
 to
 provide


evidence
 against
 Virginia
 is
 called
 from


Australia
 to
 go
 to
 Paris
 to
 provide


evidence
 against
 John
 Luke
 Bernell
 in


2021
 in
 this
 format
 that
 is
 nothing
 that


takes
 place
 in
 the
 US,
 but
 it's
 like


where
 the
 both
 the
 defense
 and
 the


prosecution
 have
 an
 ability
 to
 question


or
 have
 colloquiz
 with
 the
 accuser.
 And


she
 ends
 up
 having
 to
 retract
 her
 claims


against
 him
 as
 well.
 And
 you
 know
 they


her
 lawyers
 had
 to
 admit
 that
 this


memoir
 that
 she
 produced
 or
 memoir


manuscript
 that
 she
 produced
 in
 2011
 and


2012
 that
 she
 was
 sort
 of
 scheming
 with


this
 ghost
 writer
 who
 was
 potentially


going
 to
 work
 with
 her,
 Sharon
 Churcher,


a
 journalist
 at
 the
 Daily
 Mail.
 She
 was


scheming
 about
 how
 they
 could
 get
 the


biggest
 possible
 book
 deal
 or
 even
 like


a
 movie
 deal
 or
 some
 kind
 of


entertainment
 package
 deal.
 and
 she


already
 had
 been
 paid
 160,000
 plus
 by


the
 Daily
 Mail
 plus
 serialization


revenue
 for
 having
 done
 an
 interview


with
 them
 and
 given
 over
 the
 Prince


Andrew
 photo
 and
 then
 they
 wanted
 to


marshall
 or
 leverage
 that
 momentum


publicity
 wise
 from
 the
 Daily
 Mail's


articles
 in
 2011
 into
 a
 book
 and
 so


Sharon
 Sarin
 Churcher
 in
 this
 email


exchange
 you
 can
 go
 read
 it
 came
 ac


yeah
 you
 know
 what
 just
 like
 throw
 throw


anybody's
 name
 in
 you
 can
 think
 of
 who


might
 have
 had
 the
 most
 fleeting


association
 with
 Jeffrey
 Epstein


And
 that'll
 get
 us
 the
 biggest
 possible


book
 deal
 that'll
 entice
 the
 most


publishers
 and
 agents.
 And
 as
 to
 Duritz,


yeah,
 I
 mean,
 he's
 pretty
 well
 known
 and


we
 all
 think
 he's
 a
 pedto,
 so
 throw
 him


in
 there,
 too.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 what


they're
 saying.
 Um,
 and


>> wait,
 this
 is
 your
 interpretation
 of


what
 happened.


>> Almost
 literally
 what
 they
 say.
 I'm


almost
 quoting
 ver
 I'm
 not
 exactly


quoting.


>> Who
 said
 that?
 Who
 said
 that?


>> This
 is
 what
 Churcher
 says
 to
 Virginia


Roberts
 Guay
 and
 she's
 all
 on
 board
 with


it.
 Wait,
 how
 do
 we
 know
 that?


>> Because
 we
 have
 the
 transcripts
 of
 the


emails.


>> Oh,
 wow.
 Okay.
 And


>> they
 came
 out
 of
 the
 course
 of
 discovery


in
 in
 litigation.


>> And
 this
 person
 was


>> she
 was
 a
 trash
 journalist.
 Yeah.
 Who


was
 working
 on
 co-authoring
 the
 book


with
 her
 or
 what
 was


>> they
 were
 in
 talks
 for
 her
 to


potentially
 be
 the
 co-author
 of
 the


book.
 Uh,
 so
 they
 were
 they
 were
 sort
 of


strategizing
 as
 to
 how
 they
 could
 get
 a


book
 deal
 or
 get
 a
 literary
 agent
 to


sign
 on
 with
 Virginia
 and
 get
 her
 a


lucrative
 book
 deal.


>> And
 then
 what
 what
 ended
 up
 happening?


>> A
 draft
 manuscript
 was
 produced.
 I
 don't


know
 exactly
 how
 involved
 Church
 was.


>> Was
 there
 published
 or


>> not
 initially?
 Finally,
 a
 version
 did


eventually
 come
 out
 last
 October
 after


Virginia
 Roberts
 phrase
 purported
 death


in
 April
 of
 last
 year.
 And
 I
 only
 say


purported
 because
 the
 circumstances
 of


it
 are
 still
 bizarre.
 Look,
 I
 mean,
 I'm


I
 I'm
 willing
 to
 grant
 that
 she
 is
 in


fact
 dead
 at
 this
 point,
 but
 I
 mean


that's
 another
 sort
 of
 tangent.
 But
 no,


it
 didn't
 come
 out
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 a


draft
 was
 produced
 and
 then
 the
 draft


manuscript
 had
 to
 be
 had
 to
 be
 um


um
 revealed
 or
 handed
 over
 over
 the


course
 of
 litigation
 with
 Durowitz
 and


her
 lawyers
 by
 the
 by
 2017
 to
 2019


had
 to
 admit
 on
 her
 behalf
 so
 David
 Boy


at
 all
 that
 this
 fiction
 that
 that
 this


memoir
 manuscript
 which
 had
 been


presented
 as
 non-fiction
 which
 was


shopped
 around
 to
 potential
 book


publishers
 as
 non-fiction
 which
 have


been
 the
 basis
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 media


coverage
 around
 these
 allegations
 as
 as


though
 it
 were
 a
 non-fictional


representation
 of
 her
 purported


experiences.
 They
 finally
 have
 to
 admit


that
 it
 was
 a
 fictionalized
 account
 of


her
 purported
 experiences.
 So
 like
 for


example,


>> this
 is
 VRG's
 own
 lawyers
 ad
 like
 David


Boy,


>> right?
 Yep.
 So
 they
 basically
 said
 that


this
 manuscript
 which
 had
 been
 the
 basis


for
 her
 story
 and


>> a
 lot
 of
 the
 mythology
 like
 Bill
 Clinton


was
 on
 the
 island
 she
 claimed
 no


evidence
 Bill
 Clinton
 was
 ever
 on
 the


island.
 He
 did
 fly
 around
 in
 Epstein's


private
 jet
 in
 2002
 and
 2003
 but
 no


evidence
 he
 ever
 went
 to
 the
 island
 she


saw
 him
 on
 the
 island
 and
 which
 is
 false


as
 far
 as
 we
 as
 far
 as
 we
 know
 as
 far
 as


all
 the
 available
 evidence
 has
 ever


suggested.
 That
 probably
 is
 one
 of
 the


most
 repeated
 claims
 in
 respect
 to


Epstein,
 which
 is
 that
 Oakland
 was
 on


the
 island.
 And
 you're
 saying
 that's


just
 completely
 untrue.
 And
 that
 came


from
 VRG's
 manuscript,
 which
 ultimately


they
 had
 to
 admit
 was
 a
 work
 of
 fiction,


not


>> non-fiction,
 at least
 her
 own
 work.


>> Correct.
 But
 to
 but
 what's
 so


mindboggling
 is
 that
 just
 relatively


recently
 after
 this
 whole
 blow
 up
 around


Ebstein
 got
 ignited
 last
 July,


the
 book
 publishers
 obviously


realized
 that
 it
 was
 a
 highly
 profitable


opportunity
 for
 them
 to
 produce
 some


version
 of
 her
 manuscript
 in
 the
 form
 of


a
 new
 memoir.
 Now,
 she
 had
 been
 working


on
 a
 new
 version
 of
 it
 with
 another


ghost
 writer
 for
 some
 time,
 Amy
 Wallace,


but
 they


obviously
 wanted
 to
 peg
 the
 publication


of
 it
 to
 this
 renewed
 Epstein
 uproar.


So,
 this
 her
 the
 memoir
 finally
 gets


published
 in
 some
 capacity
 in
 October
 of


last
 year.
 It
 becomes
 an
 international


bestseller,
 not
 just
 in
 the
 United


States,
 but
 in
 Britain,
 Australia,
 etc.


And
 I'm
 still
 stunned.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 I


don't
 I
 can
 no
 longer
 really
 be
 stunned


anymore,
 but
 it's
 still
 stunning
 to


think
 back
 on
 how
 credulously
 the


reception
 to
 that
 memoir
 was,
 even


though
 I
 mean,
 it
 was
 basically
 just
 Amy


Wallace,
 this
 ghost
 writer,
 repackaging


and
 massaging.
 Um,
 oh,
 I
 always
 catch


myself
 when
 I
 use
 the
 verb
 massage
 now.


I
 shouldn't
 use
 that.
 Repackaging
 the


initial
 memoir
 manuscript
 and
 basically


updating
 it
 for
 2025
 and


Nowhere
 do
 they
 nowhere
 do
 they
 dis
 do


they
 disclose
 that
 it's
 based
 on
 a


fictionalized
 manuscript.
 So
 it's
 just
 a


fraud
 that
 was


>> So
 they
 ultimately
 did
 publish
 a
 version


of
 the
 manuscript.


>> Yes.
 Last
 year.


>> And
 did
 that
 book
 include
 the


accusations
 against
 Dersitz
 and
 Bill


Clinton
 or
 had
 that
 been
 removed
 by
 that


point?


>> To
 clarify
 those
 allegations
 of
 sexual


improprieties
 against
 Dersitz
 were
 not


in
 the
 2011
 manuscript.
 Those
 were


concocted
 later
 as
 a
 basis
 for
 Virginia


Roberts
 Guay
 to
 join
 this
 ongoing


litigation
 that
 her
 lawyer
 Bradley


Edwards
 had
 initiated
 around
 something


called
 the
 Crime
 Victim's
 Rights
 Act
 and


how
 the
 nonprosecution
 agreement
 from


2007208
 had
 supposedly
 violated
 the
 non


the
 Crime
 Victim's
 Rights
 Act.
 It's
 a


it's
 a
 complicated
 issue.
 Um
 but
 that


was
 debut
 those
 those
 claims
 against


Durich
 were
 debuted
 in
 December
 of
 2014.


Um,
 but
 there
 are
 a
 bunch
 of
 other


claims
 already
 in
 the
 manuscript
 from


2011
 and
 there's
 a
 reference
 to


Dersowitz,
 but
 it's
 just
 not
 a
 an


accusation
 of
 sexual
 uh
 misconduct.


>> Okay.
 The
 the
 three
 women
 that
 you


mentioned
 um
 Grey
 Ransom
 Farmer,
 did


they
 have
 the
 same
 lawyers
 or
 different


lawyers?
 Were
 lawyers
 working
 together?


>> Uh,
 pretty
 much
 the
 same
 lawyers.
 I


mean,
 it's
 basically
 the
 same
 cabal
 of


lawyers.
 It's
 uh
 Davis


and
 then
 Bradley
 Edwards
 firm.
 Bradley


Edwards
 was
 the
 initial
 lawyer
 that
 that


oversaw
 primarily
 the
 Florida
 the
 the


the
 purported
 victims
 from
 the
 Palm


Beach
 phase
 from
 like
 200


2
 to
 2005.
 um
 he
 started
 representing


them
 around
 2008.
 And
 then
 boys
 came
 a


little
 bit
 later
 around
 the
 more
 kind
 of


grandiose
 litigation,
 but
 they
 were


working
 they've
 worked
 in
 conjunction


with
 one
 another
 and
 still
 are.
 They're


still
 suing
 as
 a
 in
 a
 class
 action


lawsuit
 that
 they
 initiated
 last


October,
 Bank
 of
 America
 to
 extract
 a


couple
 hundred
 more
 million
 dollars
 just


like
 they
 did
 from
 JP
 Morgan
 and
 Deutsch


Bank
 and
 the
 Epstein
 estate
 and
 plenty


of
 individualized
 lawsuits
 that
 they've


alluded
 to
 but
 never
 um
 clarified
 the


parameters
 of
 like
 they
 brag
 Bradley


Edwards
 does
 that
 they
 got
 like
 20
 or
 25


settlements
 that
 are
 still
 secret.
 he


says
 from
 specific
 individuals
 whom
 he


acknowledges
 may
 not
 have
 committed
 any


wrongdoing
 at
 all,
 but
 just
 simply
 don't


want
 to
 suffer
 the
 PR
 backlash
 that


we're
 seeing
 now
 on
 steroids.
 So,
 it's
 a


hugely
 lucrative
 industry.
 And
 I
 don't


know,
 you
 tell
 me,
 David,
 is
 this
 like


dimension
 of
 this
 whole
 story
 ever


mentioned
 anywhere
 in
 any
 of
 the
 popular


media
 coverage,
 whether
 it's
 on
 podcasts


or
 on
 CNN
 or
 anywhere?


>> No.
 Um,
 okay.
 So,
 and
 even
 the


Deutschbang
 settlement,
 I
 don't
 think


I'd
 heard
 of
 that.
 What
 What
 was
 that?


So
 when
 Epstein
 dies
 August
 10th,
 2019,


right,


the
 aing
 frenzy
 breaks
 out
 in
 terms
 of


litigation
 that
 is
 brought
 against
 his


estate


cuz
 at
 that
 point
 Epstein
 is
 obviously


no
 longer
 available
 to
 contest
 any


claims
 that
 are
 made
 against
 him
 and


liel
 laws
 ceased
 to
 apply.
 People
 are


aware
 obviously
 that
 he
 was
 very


wealthy.
 He
 wasn't
 like
 a
 multi


multi-billionaire
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 people


suspected
 at
 the
 time,
 but
 according
 to


his
 um
 disclosure
 of
 assets
 when
 he
 was


arrested,
 his
 net
 worth
 was
 like
 six
 uh


650
 million.
 So
 still
 a
 pretty
 big


estate.
 And
 so
 because
 of
 this
 flood
 of


lawsuits
 against
 the
 estate,
 the


executives
 of
 the
 estate,


Darren
 Indk
 and
 Richard
 Khan,
 decide
 to


agree
 to
 coordinate
 with
 the
 victim's


lawyers,
 Bradley
 Edwards,
 David
 Boy,
 at


all
 to
 set
 up
 a
 basically
 a
 mediation


program
 that
 they
 call
 the
 embassy
 and


victims
 compensation
 fund,
 which
 is
 a


holistic


settlement
 process
 that
 victims
 or


alleged
 victims
 could
 submit
 claims
 to


and
 then
 there
 would
 be
 a
 mediator


brought
 in
 to
 evaluate
 the
 claims
 and


decide
 what
 amount
 of
 money
 to
 give
 out.


So
 there
 wouldn't
 have
 to
 just
 be
 like
 a


flood
 of
 individual
 lawsuits.
 They
 could


kind
 of
 consolidate
 it.
 And
 so
 they
 set


up
 a
 settlement
 model
 basically
 for
 the


Epstein
 estate
 which
 was
 expressly


non-adversarial,
 meaning
 there
 would
 be


no
 adversarial
 scrutinization


of
 the
 claims
 that
 were
 made
 to
 justify


somebody's
 entitlement
 to
 millions
 of


dollars.


people
 as
 uh
 uh
 claimants
 were
 entitled


to
 as
 much
 as
 $5
 billion
 from
 just
 this


one
 settlement
 fund
 and
 it
 was
 taxree
 by


the way.


>> Wait,
 this
 is
 with
 this
 is
 with
 Deutsch


Bank.


>> No,
 no,
 this
 is the
 epsian
 estate.
 I'm


getting
 to
 Deutsch
 Bank
 because
 it
 ties


into
 the
 Epstein
 estate
 from
 the
 Epstein


estate.
 This
 Epstein
 estate
 was
 first
 in


the
 chronology
 of
 settlements


>> and
 so
 they
 set
 up
 a
 settlement
 model,


right?
 It's
 a
 non-adversarial,


confidential,
 tax-free
 because
 they


claim
 that
 it
 applies
 under
 that
 it


could
 be
 categorized
 under
 the
 IRS
 code


as
 like
 compensation
 for
 an
 injury.
 So


therefore,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 pay
 income


taxes
 on
 it.
 Um,
 and
 so
 that
 gets
 set


up,
 right?
 And
 then


>> and
 who
 adjudicates
 that?


The
 court
 in
 the
 US
 Virgin
 Islands


because
 the
 estate
 was
 doiciled
 in
 the


US
 Virgin
 Islands


appointed
 on
 the
 recommendation
 of
 both


parties
 a
 an
 independent
 mediator
 or


administrator
 Simona
 Lelchuk
 her
 name
 is


who
 specialized
 she
 claimed
 anyway
 in


this
 sort
 of
 thing
 and
 like
 she
 had
 an


extra
 sensitivity
 toward
 sexual
 assault


victim
 she
 claimed
 um
 I
 mean
 it's
 kind


of a
 phony
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 you
 know


sucked
 into
 that
 nec
 necessarily
 tangent


but
 um
 yeah
 so
 there's
 an
 independent


administrator
 and
 that
 was
 modeled
 they


said
 on


>> previous
 consolidated
 settlement


mechanisms
 such
 as
 like
 the
 Jerry


Sanduski


>> um
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 recall
 the
 Jerry


Sanduski
 sand
 scandal
 at
 Penn
 State


where
 claims
 were
 made
 that
 this


football
 coach
 had
 abused
 a
 bunch
 of


boys
 and
 so
 a
 consolidated
 settlement


program
 was
 set
 up
 to
 pay
 out


settlements
 to
 claimments.


>> Okay,
 got
 it.
 So
 that's
 the
 Epstein


estate.
 So
 let's
 get
 to
 the


>> So
 then
 they
 they they
 take
 that
 model


that
 had
 been
 set
 up
 for
 the
 Epstein


estate
 and
 then
 they
 start
 going
 after


bank
 major
 multinational
 banking


institutions
 that
 David
 Boy
 and
 Bradley


Edwards
 decide
 to
 very
 creatively
 and


cleverly
 I
 have
 to
 say
 allege
 were


complicit
 in
 Jeffrey
 Epstein's
 like


world
 spanning
 child
 sex
 trafficking


operation
 and
 therefore
 reliable.


>> Wait,
 what
 is
 the
 nexus
 between
 Deutsch


Bank
 or
 Bank
 of
 America
 and
 Epstein?


Were
 those
 the
 banks
 that
 he
 used?


>> Epstein
 banked
 at
 those
 institutions.
 So


first
 JP
 Morgan
 from
 like
 the
 late
 90s


to
 2013
 roughly
 and
 then
 Deutschbank


from
 2013
 to
 2019.


>> And
 the
 argument
 is
 that
 they
 should


have
 somehow
 stopped
 his
 activities.


>> Yeah.
 That


>> or
 failed
 to
 do
 a
 KYC
 or
 something
 like


that.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 they
 they
 they
 they
 they


first
 started
 making
 a
 much
 more


accusatory
 argument
 about
 their
 direct


complicity
 in
 facilitating
 a
 sex


trafficking
 operation.
 But
 what
 the


judge
 ultimately
 agreed
 to
 was
 to
 that


they
 were
 effectively
 or
 they
 were


reasonably
 guilty
 or
 reasonably
 to
 be


found
 liable
 for
 essentially
 negligence


because
 Epstein
 would
 withdraw
 cash


and
 that's
 supposed
 to
 trigger
 certain


monitoring
 provisions
 that
 it
 was


claimed
 JP
 Morgan
 and
 Deutsch
 Bank
 did


not
 satisfactorily
 do.
 I
 mean
 it
 was


kind
 of
 like
 a
 stretch
 of
 an
 argument


frankly
 but
 because
 of
 the
 popular


climate
 around
 oh
 the
 people
 anybody
 who


was
 involved
 in
 this
 in
 any
 way
 has
 to


pay
 for
 all
 this
 pedophilic
 sex


trafficking
 there
 wasn't
 a
 whole
 lot


really
 that
 the
 lawyers
 for
 those


banking
 institutions
 could
 do
 to
 take


the
 heat
 off


>> so
 they
 settle
 right
 so
 they
 settled
 so


there
 are
 two
 funds
 and
 that
 yeah


>> how
 big
 are
 those
 settlement
 funds
 th


those
 two


>> so
 JP
 Morgan
 was
 ended
 up
 totaling


around
 290
 million


and
 the
 lawyers
 end
 up
 convincing
 the


judge
 who
 presided
 over
 this
 agreement


in
 New
 York,
 the
 federal
 judge
 Rakeoff,


to
 grant
 them
 30%
 in
 legal
 fees
 or


attorneys
 fees
 that
 they
 claimed.
 Um,


and
 Deutsch
 Bank
 was
 around
 90
 million


or
 80
 million
 maybe.
 Um,


>> okay.


>> So,
 just
 add
 those
 up
 now.
 So,
 the


Epstein
 estate
 was
 around,
 if
 I'm


remembering,
 121
 million
 and
 that's
 gone


up
 actually
 since
 even
 more
 litigation


has
 been
 filed
 separated
 apart
 from
 the


class
 action
 settlement.
 JP
 working
 290,


Deutsch
 Bank
 around
 80
 or
 90.
 So
 we're


already
 at
 like
 a
 half
 a
 billion
 dollar


industry


and
 there's
 plenty
 of
 other
 lawsuits
 and


settlements
 that
 have
 been
 spawned
 from


this
 thing.
 And
 so
 I
 just
 have
 never


understood
 or
 I
 do
 understand
 it.
 So
 I


should
 correct
 myself.
 I've
 always
 found


it
 perversely
 amazing
 that
 this
 whole


aspect
 of
 this
 story
 is
 never
 mentioned


because
 it's
 led
 to
 such
 things
 as
 this


gross
 inflation
 of
 the
 total
 number
 of


victims
 where
 you
 have
 adult
 there's


financial
 incentives.
 You're
 saying


there's
 financial
 incentives
 here
 and


just
 the
 lawyers
 are
 these
 are


contingency
 fee
 plaintiffs
 lawyers.
 They


get
 like
 30%
 or
 what's
 their
 I
 mean


these
 guys
 are
 not
 paid
 by
 the
 hour,


right?
 They
 they're
 they
 get


>> Well,
 no.
 Well,
 could
 that
 they
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 No,
 not
 it's
 not
 a


contingency
 fee.


>> Okay.


>> Set
 up
 for
 this.
 They
 they
 got
 the
 judge


to
 approve


>> a
 30%
 earmark
 of
 the
 resulting


settlement
 funds
 to
 be


g given
 over
 for
 attorneys
 fees.
 So,
 it


wasn't
 a
 contingent
 based
 on
 the
 client.


It
 was
 that
 the
 judge
 approved
 30%
 of


the
 overall
 settlement.


>> Got
 it.
 So
 the
 the
 lawyers
 who
 sort
 of


organized
 these
 settlement
 pools,


>> right,


>> negotiated
 essentially
 their
 cut
 up


front
 and
 you're
 saying
 with
 the
 judge


and
 you're
 saying
 that
 was
 about
 30%


>> of
 all
 these
 exactly
 30%.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 Got
 it.


>> But
 you
 have
 a
 if
 you
 have
 a
 set
 of


criteria
 that
 are
 so
 lax,
 I
 mean
 JP


Morgan
 even
 had
 even
 more
 lax
 criteria


than
 the
 epste
 which
 basically
 allowed


anybody
 who
 ever
 like
 came
 within
 two


football
 fields
 of
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 to


file
 a
 claim
 against
 them
 and
 get
 a
 few


million
 dollars
 taxfree.
 Um
 but
 the
 the


JP
 Morgan
 settlement
 was
 even
 more
 lax.


So
 there
 are
 people
 who
 are
 event


basically
 rejected
 the
 few
 who
 were


rejected
 from
 the
 Epstein
 estate
 fund


end
 up
 getting
 a
 settlement
 from
 some
 of


them
 anyway
 the
 JP
 Morgan
 or
 Deutschbank


fund.
 So
 that
 that's
 so
 this
 woman
 Lisa


Phillips
 who
 was
 like
 an
 adult
 model


never
 made
 any
 claim
 about
 anything
 to


do
 with
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 that
 was


wrongful
 for
 like
 20
 years
 said
 on
 a


podcast
 publicly
 that
 she
 had
 no
 idea


what
 these
 girls
 were
 talking
 about
 when


they
 make
 these
 allegations
 against


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 as
 of
 2020
 she
 said
 this


by
 2023
 she's
 getting
 you
 know
 she
 never


she
 I
 asked
 her
 she
 didn't
 disclose
 to


me
 her
 full
 amount
 but
 you
 know
 probably


around
 2
 million
 at
 least
 and
 then
 they


get
 free
 healthcare
 from
 yet
 another


settlement
 between
 the
 US
 Virgin


Islands,
 the
 government
 of
 the
 US
 Virgin


Islands
 and
 the
 and
 JP
 Morgan
 um
 that


they
 set
 aside
 for
 just
 free
 health
 care


for
 until
 2028
 for
 any
 alleged
 Epstein


victim.
 Um
 and
 it's
 just
 like
 don't


people


recognize
 how
 that
 can
 be
 incentivized


this
 inflation
 of
 the
 number
 of
 total


victims
 we're
 told
 must
 exist
 and
 that


thus
 gives
 rise
 to
 this
 mass
 hysteria


and
 moral
 panic
 about
 like
 thousands
 of


victims.
 I
 mean
 at
 this
 Bondi
 Pam
 Bondi


hearing
 that
 was
 so
 contentious
 last


week
 at
 the
 House
 Judiciary
 Committee


you
 had
 people
 screaming
 thousands
 of


victims
 need
 you
 know
 demand
 justice
 and


it's
 just
 like
 a
 concoction
 that
 is
 not


grounded
 in
 any
 approximation
 of
 like


empirical
 fact.
 So
 I
 always
 say
 if


people
 want
 to
 be
 mad
 at
 Pam
 Bondi
 and


Cash
 Patel
 for
 something,
 be
 mad
 at
 them


for
 signing
 off
 on
 that
 ridiculous
 memo


from
 last
 July
 where
 they
 include
 that


figure
 of
 over
 a
 thousand
 victims
 that


has
 f
 given
 fuel
 to
 the
 most
 maximalist


conceptions
 of
 Epstein
 mythology
 in


terms
 of
 the
 victims
 that
 were
 left
 in


their
 wake.
 I
 mean
 soccer
 always
 wants


to
 and
 I
 shouldn't
 maybe
 say
 too
 much.


I'm
 not
 and
 I'm
 not
 trying
 to
 impute
 him


at
 all,
 but
 I
 do
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 on


the
 internet
 doing
 a
 variation
 of
 what


soccer
 did
 saying,
 "Hey,
 let's
 just
 talk


about
 the
 Intel
 ties.
 Forget
 all
 this,


you
 know,
 gossip
 stuff
 around.


>> Well,
 they
 are
 interesting.
 I
 mean,
 the


intel
 ties
 are
 interesting,
 right?


>> Sure.
 I'm
 I'm,
 you
 know,
 the
 whole
 story


is
 interesting.
 It's
 interesting
 that


Epstein
 apparently
 met
 Michael
 Jackson


in
 his
 Palm
 Beach
 house
 and
 photos
 of
 it


came
 out.
 It's
 interesting
 that
 he
 can


live
 with
 everyone
 from
 Donald
 Trump
 to


Bill
 Clinton.
 I
 agree.
 It's
 interesting.


>> Let
 me
 bring
 up
 one
 sort
 of
 criticism
 of


you
 and
 then
 I
 want
 to
 give
 Kevin
 a


chance
 to
 get
 in
 here.
 So
 look,
 I
 I


think
 it's
 very
 important
 that
 we
 hold


this
 process
 to
 evidentiary
 standards


like
 you're
 saying.
 I
 think
 that


people's
 motivations
 need
 to
 be


examined,
 especially
 like
 the
 lawyers


who
 are
 bringing
 these
 cases
 who
 are,


you
 know,
 reaping
 hundreds
 of
 millions


of
 dollars.
 So
 I
 think
 you
 are
 and
 I


think
 even
 Saga
 admitted
 this,
 I
 think


you're
 playing
 an
 extremely
 important


role
 in
 this
 process
 by
 bringing
 some


rigor
 and
 accountability
 to
 a
 lot
 of


these
 claims.
 I
 think
 that's
 really


important.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 you're
 not
 really


offering
 an
 explanation
 of
 so
 many


aspects
 that
 are
 so
 interesting
 about


Epstein.
 And
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's


necessarily
 your
 duty
 to
 do
 that,
 but


I'm
 wondering,
 you
 know,
 do
 you
 have
 a
 a


theory
 of
 how
 did
 he
 accumulate
 hundreds


of
 millions
 of
 dollars?
 How
 did
 he
 get


so
 connected?
 Some
 people
 like
 Mike
 Benz


have
 said
 that
 it
 all
 goes
 back
 to
 Burr


Sterns
 where
 he
 says
 that
 one
 of
 his


accounts
 was
 BCCI
 which
 was
 this


notorious
 international
 bank
 that
 was


involved
 eventually
 was
 shut
 down


because
 it
 was
 involved
 in
 international


moneyaundering
 and
 crimes
 things
 like


that.
 So
 I
 think
 this
 is
 Mike
 Benz's


theory.
 In
 any
 event,
 do
 you
 have
 a


theory
 that
 would
 provide
 a
 satisfactory


explanation
 for
 so
 many
 of
 the
 threads


that
 we
 see?
 Or
 do
 you
 just
 feel
 like


it's
 not
 really
 your
 job
 to
 to
 do
 that


and
 your
 job
 is
 really
 more
 just
 to
 poke


holes
 in,
 you
 know,
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the


more
 outlandish
 claims
 of
 politicians
 or


lawyers?


>> Well,
 I'm
 happy
 to
 address
 any
 little


data
 point
 that
 people
 want
 to
 throw
 out


at
 me.
 I
 mean,
 I
 do
 that
 all
 day
 every


day
 pretty
 much.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 I'm


trying
 to
 avoid
 anything
 or
 be
 at
 all


evasive,
 right?
 So,
 people
 ask
 me
 all


the
 time,
 okay,
 how
 did
 he
 make
 his


money?
 What
 about
 Leslie
 Wexter,
 etc.,


etc.
 So,
 it's
 not
 like
 I'm
 unaccustomed


to
 addressing
 any
 of
 this
 stuff.
 It's


just
 that
 I
 feel
 like
 there's
 a
 bit
 of a


fallacy
 or
 a
 logical


flaw
 in
 attempting
 to
 say
 that
 it's


incumbent
 on
 me
 to
 profer
 some
 kind
 of


ultimate
 totalizing
 theory.
 I
 have
 a


theory
 I
 could
 sketch
 out
 that
 maybe


explains
 some
 of
 what
 people
 would
 like


to
 know
 in
 such
 you
 know
 that
 people
 are


so
 titillated
 by.
 But
 I
 think
 again
 one


of
 the
 things
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 the


coverage
 of
 the
 story
 has
 been
 so


horribly
 bad
 is
 that


speculation
 has
 replaced
 fact
 and
 we


just
 have
 this
 whole
 mythology
 or


folklore
 that's
 developed
 and
 that


people
 just
 kind
 of
 am
 ambiently
 absorb


and
 then
 they
 end
 up
 just
 believing


things
 that
 are
 totally
 false.
 So,
 for


example,
 people
 just
 believe,
 and
 I'm


sure
 you've
 seen
 this,
 that
 Epstein
 must


have
 referred
 to
 his
 private
 plane
 as


Lolita
 Express.
 Therefore,
 anybody
 who


was
 ever
 on
 the
 plane
 must
 have
 known


that
 this
 was
 like
 a
 child
 sex


trafficking
 plane
 because
 why
 else
 would


it
 be
 named
 the
 Lolita
 Express
 after
 the


famous
 book
 about,
 you
 know,
 12-year-old


girl
 or
 whatever
 who
 was
 a
 sexual


object.
 That's
 just
 like
 false.
 I
 mean,


that
 was
 this
 is
 there's
 never
 any


evidence
 for
 that.
 It
 was
 a
 nickname


that
 it
 was
 invented
 like
 by
 a
 it
 was
 a


cheeky
 nickname
 invented
 by
 this
 British


tabloid.
 And
 so
 that's
 just
 one
 example


of
 all
 this
 flatsom
 that


>> Okay.
 But
 but
 but
 to
 go
 back,
 do
 you


have
 a
 theory
 of
 how
 specifically


Epstein
 got
 started?
 Because
 somehow
 I


guess
 it
 was
 in
 the
 80s
 he
 went
 from


someone
 who
 was
 just
 a
 trader
 at
 Bear


Sterns
 to
 very
 quickly
 amassing
 a


fortune
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 seems
 like


hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars.
 I
 mean


like
 you
 said
 he
 died
 with
 about
 650


million.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 big
 the


fortune
 was
 in
 the
 1980s.
 We
 know
 that


Wexner
 sold
 him
 the
 townhouse.
 I
 guess


one
 of
 the
 details
 that
 came
 out
 the


other
 day
 is
 Wexner
 said
 it
 was
 at
 what


he
 was
 told
 was
 fair
 market
 value
 and


Epstein
 obtains
 his
 plane
 from
 Wexner.


So,
 I
 mean,
 is
 that
 the
 explanation
 that


somehow
 he
 got
 his
 start
 because
 Wexner


was
 extraordinarily
 generous
 towards


him?
 Like,
 I'm
 just
 curious
 like


>> not
 quite.
 Um,


so
 I
 mean
 there
 there
 was
 a
 a
 huge
 New


York
 Times
 article
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the


few
 helpful
 contributions
 to
 the
 popular


knowledge
 around
 Jeffrey
 Epstein


recently
 in
 December
 where
 they
 go


through
 I
 mean
 they
 they
 basically
 set


out
 to
 answer
 the
 question
 that


everybody
 always
 asks
 with
 like
 a
 wink


and
 a
 nod
 as
 though
 they
 think
 that
 the


asking
 of
 the
 question
 is
 supposed
 to


prove
 that
 the
 answer
 would
 be


fundamentally
 sinister.
 Meaning
 how
 did


Jeff
 Jeffrey
 Epste
 make
 his
 money?


Because
 the
 idea
 is
 that
 he
 must
 have


made
 his
 money
 by
 dent
 of
 his


orchestration
 of
 this
 pedophilic
 sex


trafficking
 ring
 that
 he
 enforced
 by


blackmail
 at
 the
 direction
 of
 the
 MSAD


or
 something
 like
 that.
 And
 the
 New
 York


Times
 goes
 into
 fairly
 forensic
 detail


about
 how
 he
 ended
 up
 accumulating
 money


over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 1980s.
 So
 people


could
 go
 read
 that
 if
 they'd
 like.
 I


mean,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 it's
 fair
 to
 say,


and
 saying
 this
 does
 not
 mean
 that
 you


have
 to
 have
 to
 condone
 everything
 that


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 ever
 did
 over
 the
 course


of
 his
 entire
 life,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that


he
 was
 definitely
 very
 high


intelligence.
 I
 do
 think
 that
 he
 was


um
 highly
 proficient
 in
 mathematics
 as
 a


young
 man,
 which
 is
 why
 he
 part
 of
 why


he
 became
 a
 math
 teacher
 at
 the
 Dalton


School,
 a
 pretty
 prestigious
 private


school
 in
 Manhattan.
 then
 ends
 up


getting
 recruited
 to
 Bear
 Sterns
 and


ends
 up
 innovating
 some
 novel
 financial


maneuvers
 that
 you're
 probably
 much
 more


fluent
 in
 than
 me
 in
 terms
 of
 describing


because
 I'm
 not
 a
 finance
 guy.
 But
 it


was
 around
 a
 time
 where
 there
 was
 a


demand
 for
 Wall
 Street
 to
 innovate
 new


tactics
 for
 very
 high
 netw
 worth


individuals
 to
 structure
 their
 wealth
 to


lessen
 their
 tax
 burden
 to
 do
 all
 kinds


of
 other
 things
 and
 Epstein
 did
 so
 and


then
 he
 leaves
 Bear
 Stern.
 So
 he
 rose
 to


the
 ranks
 of
 Beer
 Sterns
 pretty
 quickly.


So
 around
 around
 age
 24
 25
 he
 was
 like
 a


partner
 or
 he
 had
 some
 relatively
 high


ranking
 position
 um
 relative
 to
 the
 rest


of
 the
 workforce
 at
 Bear
 Sterns
 at
 at
 a


young
 age.
 He
 starts
 up
 his
 own
 boutique


financial
 advisory
 firm
 that's
 tailored


specifically
 to
 very
 high
 netw
 worth


individuals
 such
 as
 ultimately
 Leslie


Wexner
 who
 is
 one
 of
 the
 wealthiest


people
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 Yes,
 they


do
 have
 a
 he
 was
 wexter
 was
 definitely


Epstein's
 most
 important
 client.
 They


there
 was
 the
 power
 of
 attorney
 that
 was


handed
 over
 which
 is
 seen
 unto
 itself
 on


the
 internet
 to
 be
 either
 inherently


sinister
 or
 to
 show
 us
 that
 of
 course


Epstein
 must
 have
 been
 in
 some
 kind
 of


like
 pedophilic
 collusion
 with
 Wexner.


But
 I
 mean
 it's
 explicable
 if
 you


actually
 want
 to
 know
 what
 it
 was
 about.


At
 a
 certain
 point
 people
 just
 want
 to


have
 to
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 keep
 asking


that
 question
 with
 like
 a
 gleam
 in
 their


eye
 as
 though
 the
 they're
 supposed
 to


it's
 supposed
 to
 imply
 that
 there
 is


this
 ped
 that
 like
 that
 the
 pedto
 sex


trafficking
 is
 the
 ultimate
 answer
 to


everything.
 But
 you
 know,
 Gilelay


Maxwell,
 when
 she
 gave
 her
 proper


interview
 last
 summer
 to
 the
 deputy


attorney
 general,
 Todd
 Blanch,
 in
 the


very
 first
 time,
 amazingly
 enough,
 that


she
 was
 asked
 by
 any
 US
 government


official
 to
 simply
 describe
 her


experiences
 with
 Jeffrey
 Epstein.


Imagine
 that.
 Um,
 despite
 having
 been


integral,
 we
 were
 we've
 been
 told
 all


these
 years
 in
 the
 running
 of
 the
 most


prolific
 child
 sex
 trafficking


operation,
 I
 guess,
 in
 the
 world


history.
 Only
 in
 July
 2025
 did
 any


government
 official
 ever
 just
 ask
 her
 to


describe
 what
 her
 relationship
 with


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 was
 all
 about.
 And
 she


said
 that
 she
 observed
 Epstein
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 work
 that
 would
 seem
 very


complicated
 and
 intense
 to
 her
 in
 terms


of
 his
 financial
 business.
 So
 for


example,
 Maxwell
 says
 Epste
 basically


restructuring
 all
 of
 the
 finances
 for


Wexner's
 business
 holdings.
 And
 you


know,
 he
 owned
 the
 limited,
 he
 owned


Victoria's
 Secret,
 other
 kinds
 of


women's
 clothing
 outfits
 and
 retailers,


he
 had
 real
 estate
 developments.
 And


Epstein
 was
 basically
 the
 money
 guy
 for


all
 of
 it.
 And
 for
 a
 man
 who
 in
 the


early
 90s
 was
 already
 worth
 like
 a


couple
 of
 billion
 Wexner
 that
 is
 if


Epstein
 is
 getting
 like
 a
 yearly
 cut
 of


the
 revenues
 that
 could
 add
 up
 over


time,
 right?
 And
 they
 had
 a
 handful
 of


other
 very
 high
 net
 worth
 clients
 like


Elizabeth
 Johnson
 who
 was
 an
 ays
 to
 the


Johnson
 and
 Johnson
 fortune.
 Leon
 Black


the
 head
 hedge
 fund
 uh
 manager.
 So
 you


don't
 need
 that
 many
 extremely
 high
 net


worth
 clients,
 right?
 If
 you're
 their


go-to
 money
 manager
 to
 eventually
 de
 uh


build
 up
 a
 pretty
 nicesized
 fortune.
 I


would
 imagine.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 we


have
 a
 full
 accounting
 of
 like
 every


penny
 that
 he
 ever
 accumulated
 over
 the


course
 of
 his
 life,
 but
 we
 have
 quite
 a


bit
 of
 information
 and
 it
 just
 occurs
 to


me
 that
 some
 the
 people
 who
 are
 who
 most


loudly
 ask
 how
 did
 he
 get
 his
 money


almost
 don't
 even
 want
 to
 know
 or
 read


into
 the
 information
 that
 is
 currently


available.


>> All right.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 kind
 of


unusual
 that
 a
 money
 manager
 in
 that


position
 would
 obtain
 that
 much
 money
 so


quickly.
 I'll
 just
 say
 like
 from
 my


experience
 with
 the
 money
 management


business,
 they're
 not
 generally
 able
 to


charge
 that
 much.
 But
 let
 me
 put
 a
 pin


in
 that
 cuz
 I
 want
 to
 let
 Kevin
 Bass
 get


in
 here.
 I've
 been
 following
 your
 feed


quite
 a
 bit.
 You
 are
 basically
 a
 startup


entrepreneur
 who
 got
 interested
 in
 in


the
 Epstein
 files.
 I
 think
 you
 used
 AI


to
 analyze
 them.
 And
 in
 particular,


you've
 been
 looking
 at
 Reed
 Hoffman's


story
 about
 Epstein,
 and
 you've
 put


together
 an
 analysis.
 I
 think
 you've


called
 it
 the
 Reed
 Hoffman
 Files.
 I've


been
 following
 your
 your
 tweets,
 and


it's
 quite
 interesting.
 Let's
 start
 with


how
 you
 got
 into
 this,
 what
 got
 you


interested,
 and
 and
 how
 you've
 been


doing
 your
 research.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 originally,
 I
 just
 saw
 that
 uh


there
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 conflict
 uh
 on


social
 media
 about
 Reed
 Hoffman.
 I


didn't
 know
 much
 about
 uh
 the
 Epstein


files
 or
 or
 about
 that
 particular


conflict,
 but
 I
 was
 curious.
 I
 built


some
 really
 sophisticated
 AI
 tools,
 you


know,
 mostly
 using
 like
 vectorzed
 s
 uh


SQL
 databases
 and
 and
 some
 of
 the
 MCP


stuff
 with
 the
 new
 agents
 and
 uh
 for
 for


some
 other
 purposes.
 And
 so
 I
 wanted
 to


port
 those
 over
 to


see
 if
 I
 could
 resolve
 some
 of
 these


questions.
 Uh
 Elon
 had
 some
 very
 strong


opinions
 about
 Hoffman's
 involvements


with
 Epstein
 and
 he's
 usually
 at
 least


uh
 if
 he's
 not
 always
 directly
 on
 the


bullseye,
 he's
 usually
 at least
 a
 few


inches
 away.
 So
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 check


those
 out.
 And
 then
 you
 know
 I
 they
 they


came
 out
 in
 I
 guess
 late
 January,


January
 30th,
 the
 big
 ones
 that
 the
 big


drop
 that
 recently
 happened.
 And
 so
 I


just
 uh
 I
 started
 going
 through
 the
 Reed


Hoffman
 part
 in
 particular
 uh
 and
 I


essentially
 started
 to
 try
 to
 organize


or
 I
 have
 organized
 most
 of
 my
 analyses


around
 some
 core
 claims
 that
 Hoffman


made
 about
 his
 involvement
 with
 Epstein.


I've
 just
 been
 asking
 the
 question,
 are


these
 claims
 true?
 Uh
 are
 they
 supported


by
 the
 record
 or
 are
 they
 contradicted


by
 the
 record?
 And
 um
 overwhelmingly,


like
 absolutely
 overwhelmingly,
 uh
 they


appear
 to
 be
 contradicted
 relentlessly


by
 the
 uh
 the
 drop
 that
 came
 out
 in


January
 um
 30th.
 If
 you
 want,
 I
 can
 go


through
 some
 of
 the
 big
 ones.
 Uh
 and


then
 I
 can
 talk
 about


>> Yeah,
 maybe
 maybe
 a
 place
 to
 start
 is


with
 Reed
 Hoffman's
 statement
 in
 2019
 to


Axios.
 This
 is
 when
 I
 guess
 the
 Epstein


scandal
 first,
 I
 think,
 became
 national


news
 and
 people
 who
 are
 closely


associated
 with
 him
 felt
 the
 need
 to


characterize
 the
 relationship
 with
 him


to
 distance
 themselves
 to
 explain
 how


they
 knew
 him
 or
 how
 closely
 they
 knew


him.
 And
 Reed's
 statement
 at
 that
 time


was
 the
 following.
 Let
 me
 just
 read
 this


out.
 This
 is
 uh
 Reed
 Hoffman
 speaking.


My
 few
 interactions
 with
 Jeffrey
 Epstein


came
 at
 the
 request
 of
 Joey
 Itto
 for
 the


purposes
 of
 fundraising
 for
 the
 MIT


Media
 Lab.
 Prior
 to
 these
 interactions,


I
 was
 told
 by
 Joey
 that
 Epstein
 had


cleared
 the
 MIT
 vetting
 process,
 which


was
 the
 basis
 for
 my
 participation.


My
 last
 interaction
 with
 Epste
 was
 in


2015.


Still,
 by
 agreeing
 to
 participate
 in
 any


fundraising
 activity
 where
 Epstein
 was


present,
 I
 hope
 to
 repair
 his
 reputation


and
 perpetuate
 injustice
 for
 this,
 I
 am


deeply
 regretful.


>> Oh,
 give
 me
 a
 break.


>> Is
 that
 statement
 accurate?


>> Not
 at
 all.
 Uh,
 and
 in
 fact,
 it's
 not


just
 from
 2019.


Uh,
 he
 even
 reiterated
 this
 on
 February


4th
 this
 year
 on
 X
 repeatedly.
 He
 said,


"I
 only
 know
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 because
 of


fundraising
 relationship
 with
 MIT,
 which


I
 very
 much
 regret.
 These
 meetings
 were


all
 coordinated
 by
 Joeyto,
 then
 director


of
 MIT
 Media
 Lab."
 Uh,
 and
 he
 also
 says,


"We
 with
 Joey
 Eito,
 the
 director
 of
 MIT


Media
 Lab,
 who
 asked
 me
 to
 help
 MIT


fundrais
 with
 Epstein.
 I
 regret
 blah


blah
 blah."
 Like,
 none
 of
 that's
 uh
 at


all
 true.
 Uh
 there's
 very
 few
 mentions


of
 even
 fundraising
 with
 MIT.
 I
 would


even
 go
 so
 far
 as
 to
 say
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


I've
 said
 it
 this
 way
 on
 on
 some
 of
 my


posts,
 but
 it's
 like
 the
 extent
 of
 the


relationship
 between
 Epstein
 and
 Reed


Hoffman,
 it
 almost
 looks
 like
 best


friends.
 Like
 my
 my
 best
 friends
 I
 don't


interact
 with
 as
 anywhere
 near
 as
 much


as
 as
 as
 Reed
 Hoffman
 and
 um
 and
 Jeffrey


Epstein
 did
 over,
 you
 know,
 between
 2013


and
 2019.


Um
 you
 know
 there
 are
 constant
 contact


uh
 there's
 something
 around
 on
 the
 order


of
 about
 400
 initiations
 by
 Hoffman
 to


Epstein.
 It
 wasn't
 just
 mediated
 by
 Joe


Eito
 at
 all.


And
 uh
 you
 know
 there's
 their
 their
 sec


their
 assistants
 were
 in
 constant


contact
 with
 each
 other.
 They
 had


extensive
 financial
 relationships.


There's
 something
 like
 42
 different


meetings
 uh
 that
 are
 documented.
 Around


20
 are
 absolutely
 confirmed.
 Uh
 they
 met


in
 in
 person
 for
 breakfast.
 They
 would


uh
 spend
 each
 other
 spend
 each
 other


spend
 time
 with
 each
 other's
 at
 each


other's
 houses
 overnight
 meet
 um
 you


know
 Epstein
 met
 his
 wife.
 It
 is
 claimed


that
 by
 Hoffman
 that
 he
 only
 was
 there


for
 one
 night.
 Even
 the
 one
 time
 that
 we


have
 absolutely
 document
 that
 documented


that
 uh
 he's
 referring
 to
 he
 was
 there


for
 two
 nights
 and
 almost
 certainly


there
 was
 two
 other
 island
 visits
 as


well
 in
 addition.
 Uh
 it's
 an


extraordinarily
 extensive
 personal
 and


business
 relationship
 and
 it's
 not
 just


about
 Joito.
 Now
 Joita
 was
 a
 really


important
 part
 of
 it.
 Um
 Joey
 was
 sort


of
 uh
 as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 tell
 again
 you


guys
 know
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 this
 than
 I


do
 but
 as
 far
 as
 I
 can
 tell
 really
 going


through
 the
 files
 the
 last
 couple
 days.


Joey
 was
 sort
 of
 um
 Epstein's
 uh
 gateway


into
 sort
 of
 academia,
 Cambridge,


Harvard
 science.
 that's
 that's
 sort
 of


his
 main
 uh
 gateway
 there.
 Uh
 Reed


Hoffen
 was
 his
 gateway
 into
 uh
 Silicon


Valley
 into
 tech
 the
 main
 guy
 and
 uh
 so


so
 there
 is
 a
 very
 close
 relationship
 as


well
 between
 Joito
 and
 Hoffman
 but
 there


is
 also
 very
 much
 an
 independent


relationship
 between
 Hoffman
 and
 Jeffrey


Epstein.
 Uh
 very
 much
 independent
 of


Joeito.


Okay.
 So
 So
 Reed
 claimed
 that
 he
 only


had
 a
 few
 interactions
 with
 Epstein.


That's
 false.
 You're
 saying
 he
 had


hundreds


>> hundreds


>> including
 dozens
 of
 in-person
 meetings


and


>> yes


>> stay
 stay
 at
 the
 island


>> at
 least
 once
 you
 said
 for
 two
 nights


not
 one
 and
 there
 were
 probably
 a
 second


or
 third
 visit.


>> Yes.


>> There
 was
 the
 stay
 at
 the
 townhouse.


Reed
 claimed
 that
 all
 of
 his


interactions
 were
 sort
 of
 mediated
 by


Joeyto
 and
 were
 about
 the
 MIT
 media
 lab.


By
 the
 way,
 it's
 not
 clear
 why
 someone


would
 feel
 compelled
 to
 spend
 so
 much


time
 fundraising
 for
 MIT,
 which
 wasn't


even
 their
 alma
 mater.
 So,
 this
 whole


explanation
 didn't
 really
 make
 a
 lot
 of


sense
 from
 the
 beginning.
 But
 it's


pretty
 clear
 that
 the
 topics
 of


conversation
 were
 not
 about
 MIT
 or
 MIT


Media
 Lab.
 In
 fact,
 I
 thought
 one
 detail


that
 was
 really
 kind
 of
 interesting
 was


their
 first
 interaction,
 one
 of
 the


first
 was
 about
 they
 bonded
 over
 a
 book


called
 deception,


which
 I
 haven't
 I
 haven't
 read
 the
 book.


I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 thesis
 is,
 but
 it


appears


to
 justify
 the
 use
 of
 deception
 in


certain
 circumstances.


>> Anyway,
 I
 just
 think
 that
 was
 ironic,
 I


guess,
 if
 nothing
 else.


>> But
 look,
 I
 you
 know,


>> can
 I
 make
 a
 quick
 comment
 or
 go
 ahead?


Yes.
 Yeah,
 Michael,
 go
 ahead.
 Do
 you


want
 to
 be
 Reed's
 defense
 attorney
 in


this
 context?


>> Not
 not
 exactly.
 Although
 I
 end
 up,
 I


guess,
 putting
 myself
 into
 a
 position


where
 it
 can
 come
 across
 that
 way.
 I'm


really
 trying
 to
 be
 the
 the
 defense


attorney
 for
 like
 sanity.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 here's
 what
 I
 would
 say.
 I
 have
 to


just
 reject
 the
 whole
 premise
 of
 this


discussion
 that
 is
 so
 ubiquitous
 now,


which
 is
 that
 anybody
 who
 so
 much
 as


exchanged
 a
 shortling
 email
 with
 Jeffrey


Epstein,
 and
 I
 know
 Reed
 Hoffen


apparently
 had
 a
 closer
 relationship


with
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 than
 just
 one
 email


here
 or
 there,
 but
 the
 principle
 that


anybody
 who
 had
 some
 interaction
 of
 of


some
 degree
 to
 some
 degree
 or
 another,


Jeffrey
 Epste
 now
 has
 something
 that


they
 have
 to
 issue
 these
 mealymouth


melodramatic
 statements
 of
 profound


apology
 for
 is
 just
 so
 tedious
 and


ridiculous.
 What
 are
 they
 guilty
 of?
 If


the
 implication
 is
 that
 they're
 by


association
 guilty
 of
 enabling


pedophilic
 sex
 trafficking,
 that
 is
 a


flagrant
 misconception.
 Do
 people
 know


how
 come
 it's
 never
 clarified
 that


Jeffrey
 Epstein
 was
 never
 even
 accused


of
 committing
 any
 illicit
 sexual
 acts


against
 any
 person
 under
 the
 age
 of
 18


after
 the
 year
 2005.
 So
 I
 don't
 know


what
 years
 Reed
 Hoffman
 and
 Jeffrey


Epstein
 interacted.
 But
 this
 idea
 that


he
 was
 like
 looking
 the
 other
 way
 while


all
 these
 pre-teens
 were
 being
 raped
 is


just
 nonsense.
 But
 the
 media
 never


clarifies
 it.
 So
 now
 we
 have
 everybody


from
 Nome
 Chosky
 to
 Steve
 Bannon
 being


told
 that
 their
 reputation
 is
 in
 tatters


and
 they
 are
 themselves
 like
 by


association
 some
 sort
 of
 like
 sex


criminal
 enablers
 and
 it's
 just
 a
 it's


just
 a
 total
 fantasy


>> find
 this
 moral
 panic.


>> Yeah,
 Michael,
 I
 think
 this
 I
 think


you're
 making
 some
 really
 interesting


points.
 Um
 I
 think
 they're
 important.
 I


think


>> I
 mean
 Epstein
 pleaded
 guilty
 to
 two


prostitution
 charges
 in
 2008.
 You're


saying
 Reed
 Hoffman
 and
 Nome
 Chosky
 and


Steve
 Bannon
 should
 have
 all
 said,
 "Oh,


because
 the
 guy
 pleaded
 guilty
 to
 two


prostitution
 charges,
 which
 they
 were,


which
 they
 were,
 that
 means
 nobody
 can


ever
 consort
 with
 him
 ever
 again
 for
 the


rest
 of
 his
 life."
 I
 think
 that's
 a


ridiculous
 standard.


>> There's
 two
 there's
 two
 different
 issues


here.
 one
 is
 um
 whether
 or
 not
 there's


this
 global
 pedophile
 ring
 and
 you
 know


we
 can
 even
 go
 further
 and
 there's
 this


sat
 these
 satanic
 rituals
 and
 all
 this


other
 stuff
 which
 uh
 I'm
 inclined
 to


think
 that
 uh
 you're
 you're
 very
 close


to
 the
 truth
 in
 what
 you're
 saying.
 On


the
 other
 hand,
 um
 there
 are
 Reed


Hoffman's
 public
 statements
 like


dramatically
 minimizing
 the


relationship.
 Now
 sure


>> I
 think
 that
 can
 easily
 obviously
 be


explained.
 There's
 an
 obvious


explanation
 where
 we
 don't
 have
 to


necessarily
 impugn
 to
 Reed
 Hoffman,
 you


know,
 being
 a
 pedophile
 or
 any
 of
 these


other
 things
 that
 people
 are
 wanting
 to


suggest
 because
 he
 lied.
 And
 the


alternative
 explanation
 is
 just
 that


this
 is
 such
 a
 hot
 potato.
 There
 is
 a


hysteria.
 So
 people
 lie
 about
 their


relationship
 with
 Epstein
 even
 though


they're
 not
 guilty
 of
 something
 that's


terrible
 behind
 the
 scenes.


>> Any
 association
 at
 all
 is
 radio
 with


Epstein
 is
 radioactive.
 I
 mean,
 but
 so


if
 somebody
 lies,
 then
 I
 mean,
 they
 can


be
 condemned
 for
 the
 lie
 because
 lying


is
 like
 how
 Lutnik
 made
 up
 a
 ridiculous


lie
 that
 was
 totally
 pointless
 and


actually
 counterproductive
 for
 his


purposes.
 And
 the
 lie
 itself
 can
 be


condemnable,
 but
 not
 necessarily
 because


Howard
 Lutnik
 is
 covering
 up
 any
 kind
 of


pedophilic
 sex
 criminality,
 just
 because


of
 the
 moral
 hysteria
 that's
 been


allowed
 to
 be
 unleashed
 around
 this


stuff
 or
 like
 any
 connection
 in
 any
 way


to
 Epstein
 is
 like
 grounds
 for
 censure.


>> Yeah.
 And
 all
 right,
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 my


my
 point
 of
 view
 on
 this.
 So
 So
 first
 of


all,
 I
 think
 you're
 correct
 that
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 guilt
 by
 association
 happening


and
 there
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 feeding


frenzy.
 And
 like
 you
 said,
 just
 because


someone
 emailed
 Epstein
 doesn't
 mean


that
 they
 were
 involved
 with
 him
 in
 some


nefarious
 way.
 And
 I
 thought
 it
 was


unfair
 when
 Sager
 mentioned
 that
 Jason


had,
 you
 know,
 emails
 with
 Epstein
 back


in
 2011
 to
 make
 an
 introduction.
 I
 think


that's


>> I
 had
 even
 seen
 that.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not


important
 enough
 even
 to
 draw
 my


attention.
 Like,
 who
 cares?
 There's


plenty
 of
 interesting
 material
 in
 the


files,
 but
 like
 random
 emails.


>> No,
 no.
 And
 I
 I
 agree
 and
 that's
 why
 I


tried
 to
 defend
 Jason
 there
 cuz
 I
 know


that
 there
 was
 just
 nothing
 to
 that.


Now,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Reed,
 I
 think
 that


there's
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 that
 are


interesting
 about
 this.
 Number
 one
 is


when
 this
 new
 Epstein
 files


drop,
 Reed
 came
 out
 on
 X
 and
 very


aggressively
 started
 pointing
 the
 finger


at
 other
 people,
 wildly
 accusing
 both


Elon
 Musk
 and
 Donald
 Trump
 of
 somehow


being
 involved
 in
 Epstein's


purported
 crimes.
 And
 this
 is
 just
 a


classic
 case
 of
 someone
 throwing
 stones


while
 living
 in
 a
 glass
 house.
 I
 mean,


you
 look
 at
 his
 own
 statements
 from
 2019


all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 weeks
 ago
 and
 they


don't
 hold
 water
 at
 all.
 He
 lies
 about


the
 extent
 of
 his
 relationship
 with


Epstein,
 how
 many
 times
 they
 met,
 what


the
 subject
 matter
 was,
 what
 the
 context


was,
 how
 many
 times
 he
 visited
 the


island
 potentially.
 I
 mean,
 just
 one
 lie


after
 another
 while
 again
 wildly


accusing
 other
 people.
 And
 you
 do
 have


to
 just
 ask
 what
 is
 going
 on
 here?


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean,
 that
 just
 goes
 to
 show


how
 weaponizable
 this
 whole
 thing
 is
 and


how
 the
 Epstein
 story
 or
 any
 kind
 of


tangential
 connection
 to
 Epstein
 can
 be


leveraged
 to
 serve
 some
 kind
 of


pre-existing
 agenda.
 So,
 if
 like
 Reed


Hoffman
 and
 Elon
 Musk
 don't
 like
 each


other,
 then
 they
 could
 accuse
 each
 other


of
 like
 having
 a
 more
 a
 closer


connection
 to
 Epstein
 than
 they
 did.
 And


it's
 just
 like
 a
 uh
 a
 slugfest.
 And
 yet,


I'm
 still
 struggling
 to
 understand
 like


what
 the
 underlying
 accusation
 of


wrongdoing
 is
 supposed
 to
 be.


above
 and
 beyond
 just
 how
 perhaps
 Reed


Hoffman
 and
 or
 Musk
 or
 whomever
 might


have
 misrepresented
 the
 relationship.


>> Well,
 the
 question
 the
 question
 is
 also


partly
 like
 why
 did
 he
 need
 to
 so


aggressively
 attack
 others?
 Why
 did
 he


need
 to
 so
 aggressively
 lie
 about
 the


relationship?
 Is
 it
 just
 that
 he's


covering
 himself
 because
 of
 a
 moral


hysteria
 or
 is
 there
 I
 don't
 know.
 Well,


I
 mean,
 my
 my
 theory
 on
 this,
 I
 think


it's
 kind
 of
 obvious
 what
 he's
 doing,
 is


that
 by
 pointing
 the
 finger
 at
 Trump
 or


Elon,
 actually
 both,
 he's
 driving


everyone
 into
 their
 partisan
 tribes,


>> right?


>> So,
 as
 to,
 I
 think,
 seek
 protection
 of


the
 Democrat
 tribe
 to
 which
 he's


contributed
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of


dollars.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 worked.
 I


mean,
 you
 look
 at
 the
 mainstream
 media


coverage
 of
 this,
 the
 New
 York
 Times


coverage
 of
 it,
 which
 we
 talked
 about
 in


a
 previous
 episode
 of
 the
 show.
 They


wrote
 an
 article
 about
 Epstein's
 ties
 to


Silicon
 Valley.
 Other
 people
 who
 had
 far


less
 extensive
 of
 a
 relationship
 with


Epstein
 got
 paragraphs
 in
 that
 story.


Reed
 Hoffman
 was
 only
 mentioned
 in
 one


sentence
 along
 with
 three
 other
 people.


So,
 he
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 getting
 a
 pass


from,
 you
 know,
 Michael,
 if
 you
 know,


you
 want
 to
 characterize
 this
 as
 a


feeding
 frenzy
 or
 moral
 panic
 or
 a
 Syria


or
 what
 have
 you,
 whatever
 it
 is,
 he


seems
 to
 be
 getting
 a
 pass
 from
 the


media.
 And
 my
 point
 about
 this
 has
 not


been
 to
 accuse
 Reed
 of
 crimes
 because
 I


don't
 think
 we
 have
 any
 basis
 for
 that


whatsoever.
 Let
 me
 just
 state
 that


clearly.
 My


>> is
 there
 a
 fallacy
 of
 all
 this
 then?


>> No.
 Well,
 let
 me
 let
 me me
 get
 to
 that.


My
 my
 point
 has
 just
 been
 that
 the
 media


needs
 to
 cover
 this


>> in
 a
 fair
 and
 even-handed
 way
 as
 opposed


to
 like
 you
 said
 weaponizing
 it
 to
 go


after
 the
 people
 they
 don't
 like
 because


there's
 political
 advantage
 in
 that.
 Or


another
 parallel
 is
 Hillary
 Clinton
 just


came
 out
 this
 week
 and
 gave
 an
 interview


on
 the
 BBC
 where
 she
 said
 we
 the


Clintons,
 Bill
 and
 I,
 we
 had
 no
 real


connections
 with
 Epstein,
 but
 Donald


Trump,
 we
 can
 just
 assume
 as
 unassalably


true
 that
 he's
 in
 the
 process
 of


orchestrating
 a
 cover
 up
 because
 he
 has


something
 to
 hide.
 Now,
 and
 then
 on
 on


the
 other
 hand,
 Trump
 will
 toggle
 back


and
 forth
 between


uh
 Bill
 Clinton
 and
 Larry
 Summers
 and


Reed
 Hoffman.
 They're
 the
 ones
 who
 are


truly
 implicated
 by
 their
 association


with
 Epstein.
 I
 had
 nothing
 really
 to
 do


with
 the
 guy.
 And
 then
 the
 next
 day


he'll
 say,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 a
 little
 upset
 or


rofal
 that
 Bill
 Clinton's
 been
 dragged


into
 this
 mess."
 And
 it
 just
 gets,
 you


know,
 framed
 around,
 organized
 around


just
 like
 a
 partisan
 battering
 ram.
 And


it
 just
 becomes
 incredibly
 tedious


because
 there
 doesn't
 even
 have
 to
 be


anymore
 any
 concrete
 allegation
 of
 any


wrongdoing
 whatsoever.
 There's
 no


credible
 allegation
 of
 any
 pedophilic


wrongdoing
 by
 either
 Donald
 Trump,
 Bill


Clinton,
 Reed
 Hoffman,
 Elon
 Musk,


anybody.
 It's
 like
 what
 are
 we
 talking


about
 here?
 Ultimately,
 we're
 like
 in


this
 other
 domain
 of
 like
 who
 can


establish
 the
 most
 damning
 guilt
 by


association
 even
 though
 nobody
 can
 spell


out
 what
 the
 guilt
 is
 supposed
 to
 be


tied
 to.


>> Well,
 and
 but
 here's
 the
 question
 is
 why


did
 Reed
 so
 brazenly
 lie
 about
 his


relationship
 with
 Epstein?
 It
 could
 just


be


>> why
 do
 you
 have
 a
 lipnic
 lie?
 Well,
 it


could
 just
 be
 that
 he
 wants
 to
 protect


his
 reputation
 in
 business
 by
 minimizing


the
 association.
 But
 obviously,
 when
 you


lie
 that
 extensively
 and
 that
 brazenly


about
 it,
 it
 is
 going
 to
 make
 people


think
 that
 you
 have
 something
 to
 cover


up.
 And
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 that


>> people
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 dumb
 things.
 I


mean,
 is
 there
 like
 any
 evidence
 at
 all


that
 would
 that
 would
 tie
 Reed
 Hoffin
 to


some
 kind
 of
 child
 sex
 crime?
 Not


>> I'm
 not
 accusing
 him
 of
 that.
 So
 if


people
 think
 that's
 what's
 being
 covered


up,
 then
 they
 should
 be
 disabused
 of


that
 facious
 notion
 rather
 than


countenancing
 the
 notion
 and
 allowing


the
 mass
 hysteria
 to
 continue


proliferating
 unhindered.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 you
 something,
 Michael?
 What


evidence
 is
 there
 for
 um
 so
 on
 the


island
 or
 in
 general?
 What
 evidence
 is


there
 that
 um
 people
 were
 being


trafficked?
 Maybe
 not
 minors.
 Uh,
 did


that
 actually
 were
 people
 actually
 going


to
 the
 island
 for
 that
 purpose?
 Was
 that


that
 extensive
 or
 not?


>> It's
 impossible
 to
 know
 what
 people
 even


mean
 by
 trafficking
 anymore.
 Trafficking


is
 an
 incredibly
 nebulous
 concept.
 It's


very
 much
 open
 to
 the
 whims
 and


discretion
 of
 prosecutors
 who
 seek
 to


fit
 some
 fact
 pattern
 to
 a
 desire
 to


prosecute
 somebody
 for
 some
 sort
 of
 t,


you
 know,
 sexual
 related
 offense.
 if
 it


involves
 simply
 facilitating
 the


movements
 of
 somebody
 from
 point
 A
 to


point
 B.
 So
 if
 adult
 women
 consensually


flew
 on
 an
 airplane
 to
 go
 visit
 a
 luxury


island
 in
 the
 Caribbean
 and
 over
 the


course
 of
 that
 visit
 maybe
 they
 engage


in
 some
 consensual
 sex
 act
 and
 then
 20


years
 later
 they
 can
 retroactively


classify
 it
 as
 trafficking
 and
 that
 will


entitle
 them
 to
 like
 millions
 of
 dollars


in
 taxfree
 settlement
 money.
 Are
 we


going
 to
 take
 at
 face
 value
 that
 that


constitutes
 trafficking?
 because
 I


don't.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 always
 a
 little
 bit


mystified
 as
 to
 what
 we're
 supposed
 to


understand
 as
 trafficking.
 Now,


>> so
 your
 overall
 perspective
 on
 this
 is


basically
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 discourse


about
 this
 is
 constructed
 and
 we
 don't


really
 understand
 the
 underlying
 facts.


Is
 that
 your


>> I
 mean
 I
 understand
 the
 underlying
 facts


to
 the
 greatest
 degree
 that
 I
 can


ascertain
 them.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 they're


they
 are
 just
 chronically
 and
 almost


unbelievably
 mischaracterized
 everywhere


you
 look.


>> Let
 me
 get
 you
 to
 react
 to
 this
 tweet


that
 someone
 just
 at
 mentioned
 you
 on.


Uh
 oh,
 here
 we
 go.


>> A
 brilliant
 uh
 feedback.
 Um


>> well,
 this
 is
 Okay,
 this
 is
 a
 guy.
 I


don't
 know
 this
 guy.
 Present
 witness.
 Um


but
 this
 is
 what
 he's
 saying
 is
 the


evidence.
 Okay,
 so
 I
 just,
 you
 know,
 I


want
 to
 get
 your
 reaction
 to
 Well,
 let


me
 read
 this
 for
 people
 who
 are
 just


listening
 and
 can't
 see
 the
 screen
 and


then
 I'll
 get
 your
 reaction
 to
 it.
 So
 he


he
 says,
 here's
 the
 evidence.
 $160


million
 from
 Leon
 Black,
 $50
 million


townhouse
 and
 power
 of
 attorney
 over


Wexner's
 estate.
 Cameras
 in
 his


residence
 wired
 by
 Israeli
 government.


Compromising
 photos
 of
 Prince
 Andrew


Clint,
 etc.
 Confirmed
 sex
 trafficking
 of


underage
 girls
 from
 Maxwell
 Brunell
 and


others.
 Teaching
 job
 with
 William
 Bar


Princy's
 CIA.
 Kosogi
 was
 a
 client
 of


Epstein.


Princes
 moneyaundering
 for
 intelligence.


Adviser
 to
 Ehood
 Barack
 and
 the


Rothschilds.
 Rumler
 chief
 who
 was
 a


chief
 legal
 officer
 of
 Goldman
 Sachs
 and


former
 White
 House
 counsel
 under
 Obama


was
 a
 key
 adviser
 and
 backup
 executive


as
 well.
 There
 are
 millions
 of
 files


still
 redacted.
 None
 have
 been
 released


by
 CA,
 State
 Department.
 This
 is
 just


the
 tip
 of
 the
 iceberg.
 Anyone
 telling


you
 that
 there's
 nothing
 to
 see
 here
 is


attempting
 to
 whitewash
 the
 most


important
 revealing
 intelligence
 related


story
 of
 our
 lifetimes.
 And
 then
 he


calls
 you
 out
 here.
 Michael
 Tracy


doesn't
 understand
 the
 difference


between
 evidence
 and
 proof
 and
 is


cynically
 exploiting
 sexually
 abused


women
 for
 engagement.


>> Okay.
 I
 mean,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 don't
 know


what
 that
 guy
 is
 even
 arguing
 all
 that


stuff
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 evidence
 of.


like
 what
 is
 the
 ultimate
 contention


that
 he's
 claiming
 those
 myriad


scattered
 data
 points
 are
 supposed
 to


justify?
 I
 mean
 it
 it
 that's
 that's
 why


that's
 what's
 so
 strange
 about
 this


story.
 Nobody
 can
 really
 ever
 articulate


like
 Sager
 struggled
 to
 articulate
 what


I
 suspect
 actually
 is
 his
 ultimate


belief
 which
 is
 that
 there
 was
 some
 kind


of
 pedot
 trafficking
 operation.
 like
 he


I
 think
 said
 that
 he
 agreed
 with
 the


Thomas
 Massie
 quote
 that
 I
 read
 out
 to


him,
 but
 on
 its
 face
 that's
 sort
 of
 like


a
 bizarre
 statement
 to
 make.
 So,
 they


latch
 on
 to
 this
 other


peripheral
 stuff
 around
 intelligence
 and


whatnot.
 And
 that
 guy
 said,


"How
 dare
 anyone
 ever
 say
 there's


nothing
 to
 see
 here?"
 And
 he
 ascribed


that
 to
 me.
 I've
 never
 said
 there's


nothing
 to
 see
 here.
 People
 tell
 me
 all


the
 time
 that
 I
 allegedly
 have
 said


there's
 nothing
 to
 see
 here,
 but
 I
 don't


say
 that
 at
 all.
 I'm
 pretty
 much
 as


obsessed,
 if
 not
 more
 obsessed
 with
 this


story
 than
 anyone
 at
 this
 point
 to
 a


degree
 that's
 probably
 not
 very
 healthy


like
 mentally.


>> Obsessed
 with
 it,
 but
 hold
 on.
 You're


obsessed
 with
 Hold
 on,
 Michael.
 Let
 me


just
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 about
 that.


>> You're
 obsessed
 with
 it
 in
 the
 sense


that
 you
 think
 this
 is
 a
 modern-day


Salem
 witch
 trial,


>> right?
 Which
 is
 fascinating.


>> Yeah.
 So
 you're
 fascinated
 from
 like
 a


sociological
 standpoint
 which
 is
 have


humans
 evolved
 beyond
 you
 know
 where


they
 were
 hundreds
 of
 years
 ago
 engaging


in
 witch
 hunts
 and
 things
 like
 that
 or


do
 you
 think
 it's
 interesting
 in
 other


ways?


>> I
 think
 it's
 interesting
 in
 other
 ways


definitely
 in
 that
 way
 as
 well
 but
 there


are
 other
 ways
 in
 which
 it's


interesting.
 I
 think
 it's
 almost


interesting
 as
 an
 anthropological
 survey


of
 sorts
 among
 you
 know
 elites
 movers


and
 shakers
 you
 could
 say
 where
 Epstein


did
 have
 this
 extraordinary
 ability
 to


network
 and
 to
 convene
 people
 who


probably
 otherwise
 would
 never
 have
 been


convened.
 So
 I've
 been
 saying
 that
 I


think
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 is
 the
 only
 man
 on


earth
 who
 could
 have
 brought
 together


for
 a
 friendly
 social
 pow-wow
 Nam
 Chosky


and
 Steve
 Bannon.
 Like
 I'm
 almost


jealous
 of
 that.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 sure
 that


would
 have
 been
 a
 very
 fascinating


discussion
 to
 listen
 in
 on,
 right?
 And


there
 are
 other
 examples.
 And
 so,
 I


think
 it's
 interesting
 from
 that


perspective.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 everything


that
 every
 little
 piece
 of
 information


that
 can
 be
 uncovered
 about
 Jeffrey


Epstein's
 life
 is
 now
 almost


intrinsically
 interesting
 just
 given
 the


salience
 of
 the
 story,
 right?
 So,
 I


guess
 I'm
 interested
 just
 from
 that


perspective
 because
 like
 obviously
 he's


now
 a
 historic
 or
 world
 historic
 even


figure.
 And
 so,
 yeah,
 I'm
 always
 I'm


always
 down
 to
 find
 out
 something
 new


about
 what
 Jeffrey
 was
 up
 to.
 So,
 sure,


I
 think
 it's
 interesting
 politically


just
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 this
 can
 be


leveraged
 into
 some
 sort
 of
 political


battering
 ram
 against
 enemies.
 And,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 like
 the
 number
 one


oppositional
 Trump
 narrative
 of
 the


second
 term.
 It's
 almost
 Russia
 gate


redux
 in
 the
 outsized


prominence
 that
 ep
 that
 uh
 Democrats
 are


giving
 it
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 they
 bring
 up


day
 after
 day
 in
 hopes
 of
 it


undercutting
 Trump
 or
 beding
 him.
 So


>> yeah,
 it
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 like
 the


the
 new
 new
 Russia
 gate
 in
 in
 that
 way


where
 every
 possible


>> tangential
 fact
 is
 somehow
 connected


>> and
 it
 the
 whole
 thing
 kind
 of


metastizes
 and
 is
 used
 in
 a
 partisan


weaponized
 way.


>> Yeah.
 And
 but
 but
 it's
 different
 in
 that


there's
 an
 international
 component
 like


this
 is
 the
 number
 one
 scandal
 right
 now


that's
 ravaging
 Norway,
 Slovakia,
 I
 was


mentioning
 obviously
 Great
 Britain


today,


other
 places,
 you
 know,
 United
 Arab


Emirates,
 um
 name
 your
 country.
 So


there's
 like
 it's
 been


internationalized,
 which
 is
 just


fascinating
 as
 well.
 The
 didn't
 didn't


they
 burn
 like
 an
 effigy
 of
 Jeffrey


Epstein
 in
 Iran
 or
 something?
 I
 mean
 it


just
 never
 ends.
 So
 of
 course
 there's


like
 infinite
 fascinating
 material
 at


least
 to
 me.
 I
 just
 don't
 accept
 that
 in


order
 to
 be
 fascinated
 by
 this,
 we
 must


buy,
 we
 must,
 you
 know,
 have
 this
 weird


epistemology
 where
 we
 can
 just
 collect


all
 these
 discrepant
 little
 pieces
 of


information,
 blast
 them
 out
 on
 the


internet,
 and
 then
 just
 think
 that
 we've


done
 the
 argumentative
 and
 logical
 work


necessarily
 necessary
 to
 somehow


establish
 how
 that
 proves
 our
 ultimate


notions
 about
 what
 the
 story
 is
 supposed


to
 signify,
 which
 again
 is
 pedophilic


sex
 trafficking.
 enforced
 by
 blackmail


that
 ens
 snared
 prominent
 individuals
 at


the
 direction
 of
 some
 intelligence


agency.
 That's
 the
 crux
 of
 the
 Epstein


mythology
 and
 it's
 been
 systematically


unraveled


including
 you
 know
 partially
 by
 this
 the


disclosure
 of
 more
 Epstein
 files
 but


even
 prior
 to
 January
 30th
 or
 December


19th
 the
 two
 productions
 there
 was
 never


any
 credible
 evidence
 for
 any
 of
 it.
 So


yeah,
 I
 am
 fascinated
 in
 terms
 of
 how


people
 come
 to
 believe
 such
 mythological


things
 and
 the
 journalistic
 malfeasants


again
 that
 has
 been
 characterizing
 the


story
 as
 well
 is
 is
 of
 particular


interest
 to
 me
 because
 they
 it's
 been
 a


central
 factor
 in
 how
 the
 mythology
 has


been
 allowed
 to
 just
 kind
 of
 proliferate


without
 any
 counterveailing
 point
 of


view


being
 put
 to
 it.
 All
 right,
 I
 think


that's
 a
 pretty
 good
 place
 for
 us
 to


wrap
 up.
 Kevin,
 do
 you
 have
 any
 final


thoughts?


>> Um,
 I'll
 just
 continue
 releasing
 some
 of


this
 stuff.
 I
 uh
 I
 tend
 to
 agree
 with


Michael,
 but
 um
 you
 know,
 I
 also
 think


that
 sticking
 to
 the
 facts
 is
 also
 very


important
 too
 and
 and
 telling
 the
 truth


is
 is
 important
 in
 both
 directions
 as


well.
 So,


>> can
 I
 can
 I
 just
 make
 one
 concluding


thought?
 I
 I
 actually
 do
 think
 it's,
 you


know,
 I'm
 I'm
 happy
 for
 this
 opportunity


to
 speak
 on
 your
 podcast.
 I
 assume
 I'm


reaching
 an
 audience
 that
 probably
 would


not not
 otherwise
 hear
 of
 me
 to
 a
 large


extent
 and
 because
 I
 do
 think
 it's


actually
 very
 disturbing
 that
 so
 many


people
 around
 the
 world
 are
 being
 told


that
 it's
 somehow
 been
 proven
 or


vindicated
 that
 there
 is
 a
 massive
 child


rape
 ring
 or
 that
 there
 were
 mass
 child


rapes
 that
 were
 allowed
 to
 be


perpetrated
 by
 the
 highest
 levels
 of


government
 and
 then
 were
 covered
 up


because
 as
 I
 mentioned
 on
 Piers
 Morgan


this
 week,
 it's
 very
 easy
 to
 imagine
 how


people
 with
 a
 predisposition
 toward


mental
 illness


who
 hear
 this
 stuff
 and
 believe
 it
 might


be
 driven
 to
 do
 something
 like


homicidally
 crazy.
 So,
 I'm
 not


predicting
 anything
 in
 particular.
 I


just
 think
 it's
 it's
 probably
 the
 most


explosive


thing
 to
 tell
 the
 mass
 public
 in
 terms


of
 what
 it
 might
 incite
 particular


people
 with
 a
 particular
 mental


instability
 to
 to to
 do.
 So,
 I
 mean,


that's
 just
 one
 of
 the
 potentially


detrimental
 effects
 of
 all
 this
 that
 I


think
 it
 should
 be
 rationally
 countered


to
 the
 maximum
 extent
 possible.
 And
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 beset
 with
 this


issue
 for
 the
 foreseeable
 future.
 So,
 at


a
 certain
 point,
 I
 don't
 know,
 maybe


there
 should
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more


momentum
 behind
 providing
 some
 degree
 of


a
 rational
 corrective.
 I
 mean,
 or
 does


it
 is
 it
 just
 me?
 I
 mean,
 am
 I
 the
 only


guy
 who's
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 this
 forever


more?
 I
 mean
 there's
 some
 more
 who
 have


like
 come
 to
 take
 on
 a
 little
 bit
 more


of
 a
 skeptical
 perspective
 but


>> well
 I
 think
 we
 we
 have
 we
 should
 be


cognizant
 of
 the
 real
 world


ramifications
 rather
 than
 just
 speaking


about
 it
 in
 the
 abstract
 or
 who
 suffers


more
 Reed
 Hoffman
 versus
 Elon
 Musk
 or


all
 this
 other
 stuff.
 I
 think
 it
 it


really
 is
 a
 crazym
 thing
 that's
 been


inculcated
 in
 the
 public.


>> Yeah.
 Well
 look
 I
 think
 both
 of
 you
 have


performed
 very
 valuable
 services


for
 the
 public
 in
 regards
 to
 this
 whole


episode.
 I
 think
 Michael,
 you
 are
 asking


really
 important
 questions
 about


evidentary
 standards
 and
 what
 is
 the


basis
 for
 some
 of
 the
 more
 let's
 call


them
 Epste
 maximalist
 claims
 out
 there


again
 about
 this
 global
 pedophile
 ring


and
 so
 forth
 and
 I
 think
 you're
 right


that
 when
 you're
 talking
 about
 crimes


you
 have
 to
 be
 evidence-driven
 and
 there


is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 feeding
 frenzy
 here


and
 it
 is
 appropriate
 to
 ask
 what
 the


motivations
 are
 of
 everyone
 involved
 in


the
 story
 and
 you're
 one
 of
 the
 only


people
 who
 are
 doing
 it
 although
 it
 does


seem
 like
 you
 are
 making
 a
 There
 does


seem
 to
 be a
 vibe
 shift
 a
 little
 bit


around
 what
 you're
 doing.


>> Yeah.
 Most
 people
 who
 are
 have
 like
 who


have
 their
 brains
 wired
 in
 a
 normal
 way,


which
 would
 not
 include
 me,
 you
 know,


would
 probably
 have
 an
 like
 a
 negative


emotional
 reaction
 to
 being
 inundated


day
 in
 and
 day
 out
 with
 accusations
 of


personally
 being
 a
 pedophile
 or


harboring
 like
 depraved
 sexual
 fantasies


of


>> children
 or
 whatever.
 But
 like,
 you


know,
 obviously
 that
 is
 not
 the
 case
 for


me.
 But
 I
 can
 withstand
 it
 because
 I'm


used
 to
 the
 torrent
 of
 vitriol.
 But
 most


people,
 I
 think,
 probably
 would
 be


dissuaded
 from
 taking
 a
 certain
 angle
 on


a
 certain
 subject
 if
 that's
 what
 they


had
 to
 endure.


>> Well,
 the
 mob
 does
 not
 like
 being


accused
 of
 being
 a
 mob.
 And
 their


defense
 mechanism
 seems
 to
 be
 to
 accuse


anyone
 who
 points
 out
 some
 of
 these


problems
 and
 the
 the
 logic
 of
 basically


somehow
 being
 involved
 in
 in
 the
 crimes


that
 they're
 alleging.


So
 in
 any
 event,
 I
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 you


are
 performing
 a
 valuable
 service.
 You


know,
 when
 Hollywood
 dramatizes
 this,


it's
 um
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 Henry
 Fonda


and
 the
 Oxbow
 incident
 or
 maybe
 it's


Gregory
 Pek
 and
 Tequila
 Mockingbird.


You've
 got
 a
 mob
 and
 you
 have
 this
 one


lone
 figure
 who's
 standing
 up
 thwart
 the


mob
 trying
 to
 talk
 sense
 into
 them.
 And


you
 know,
 in
 real
 life,
 it's
 not
 Gregory


Peek.
 It's
 like
 a
 guy
 in
 a
 one-bedroom


apartment
 in
 New
 Jersey.


>> Yes.


for
 all
 the
 money
 I'm
 told
 I'm


surreptitiously
 receiving
 from
 Leslie


Wexner
 and
 the
 MSAD.
 I
 mean,
 I
 wish
 I


could
 get
 some
 better
 digs,
 but


>> yeah.
 And
 Kevin,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 what


you're
 doing
 is
 really
 important
 because


I
 think
 that
 this
 the
 citizen
 journalism


here
 that's
 soothing
 through
 the
 Epstein


files
 is
 turning
 up
 really
 interesting


things.
 And
 I
 do
 not
 think
 it's


appropriate
 for
 Re
 to
 be
 again
 wildly


pointing
 the
 finger
 at
 other
 people


while
 the
 evidence
 shows
 that
 he's
 been


bold-faced
 lying
 about
 every
 aspect
 of


his
 relationship
 with
 Jeffrey
 Epstein.


And
 to
 be
 honest,
 if
 he
 had
 just
 kept


his
 mouth
 shut
 and
 not
 accused
 other


people,
 I'm
 not
 even
 sure
 this
 would
 be


a
 topic
 on
 the
 show.
 I
 would
 just
 wait


to
 let
 the
 chips
 fall
 where
 they
 may
 and


see
 what
 ultimately
 comes
 out
 about


this.
 But
 he
 kind
 of
 put
 himself
 in
 play


by
 saying
 all
 of
 these
 things
 and
 I
 do


think
 it's
 appropriate
 to
 examine
 the


record
 and


and
 assess
 his
 credibility
 on
 that


basis.
 And
 you've
 done
 that
 job
 and
 I


hope
 you
 and
 other
 people
 will
 keep


going
 through
 the
 files
 and
 actually


seeing
 what
 is
 actually
 there
 so
 we
 can


get
 to
 the
 truth
 of
 this
 story.


>> I
 agree
 and
 thank
 you.


>> Well,
 let's
 let's
 wrap
 it
 there.
 I
 just


want
 to
 make
 one
 final
 point,
 which
 is,


you
 know,
 even
 when


years
 ago
 this
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 cause
 celeb


on
 the
 right
 where
 you
 had
 right-wing


podcasts
 pointing
 the
 finger
 at
 Bill


Clinton
 or
 other
 left-wing
 figures.
 I


never
 weighed
 in
 on
 this.
 I
 wasn't
 sure


what
 to
 think.
 I
 still


am
 not
 completely
 sure
 what
 to
 think


about
 it.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 over
 my


skis
 in
 terms
 of
 overly
 associating


myself
 with
 any
 one
 point
 of
 view


because
 I
 think
 when
 people
 do
 that
 they


do
 kind
 of
 dig
 in
 and
 I'm
 keeping
 an


open
 mind
 with
 respect
 to
 what
 comes
 out


next.
 It
 would
 not
 surprise
 me
 at
 all
 if


Michael
 Tracy
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 correct


but
 also
 it
 wouldn't
 completely
 surprise


me
 if
 some
 version
 of
 Sagar's
 uh
 version


of
 the
 story
 proved
 to
 be
 correct


assuming
 more
 evidence
 comes
 out.
 So
 I'm


keeping
 an
 open
 mind.
 I
 do
 think
 it's


really
 important
 for
 us
 to
 evaluate
 the


claims
 critically,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 think


it's
 important
 to
 hear
 from
 people
 like


Michael
 Tracy
 and
 I
 look
 forward
 to


seeing
 what
 comes
 next
 and
 we'll
 address


it
 then.
 I


>> I
 try
 to
 be
 rigorously
 evidence-based
 as


well
 myself.
 So,
 I
 don't
 discount
 the


idea
 that
 something
 could
 theoretically


come
 out
 that
 would
 undermine
 some
 of


the
 assumptions
 or
 conclusions
 that
 I've


derived
 from
 my,
 you
 know,
 research
 and


reporting
 on
 this.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 a


healthy
 epistemological
 habit
 to
 always


be
 open
 to
 the
 possibility
 of
 something


that's
 contra
 in
 contravention
 of
 your


prior
 assumptions
 uh
 being
 presented
 to


you.


>> Absolutely.


>> Fully
 agreed.
 Okay,
 we'll
 leave
 it


there.
 Thanks,
 guys.


>> We'll
 let
 your
 winners
 ride.


>> Rainman
 David


and


>> we
 open
 sourced
 it
 to
 the
 fans
 and


they've
 just
 gone
 crazy
 with
 it.
 Love


you.
 Queen
 of


>> your


besties
 are
 gone.


>> That
 is
 my
 dog
 taking
 notice
 your


driveways.


>> Oh
 man,
 myasher
 will
 meet
 me
 up.


>> We
 should
 all
 just
 get
 a
 room
 and
 just


have
 one
 big
 huge
 orgy
 cuz
 they're
 all


just
 useless.
 It's
 like
 this
 like
 sexual


tension
 that
 we
 just
 need
 to
 release


somehow.


be
 wet
 your
 feet.


We
 need
 to
 get
 murky's
 art.


I'm
 going
 all
 in.
