2025
 was
 dominated
 by
 Trump
 and
 his


tariffs.
 And
 2026,
 well,
 that
 will
 be


the
 year
 that
 China
 will
 dominate
 the


global
 economy.
 More
 and
 more


governments
 will
 hit
 a
 debt
 limit.
 The


AI
 bubble
 will
 not
 pop
 and
 China
 will


blockade
 Taiwan.
 Hey,
 I'm
 Yuri.
 I
 have a


PhD
 in
 economics
 and
 every
 year
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 year,
 I
 predict
 the
 five
 key


mega
 trends
 that
 will
 dominate
 the


global
 economy
 in
 the
 next
 year.
 Last


year,
 my
 predictions
 did
 surprisingly


well,
 predicting
 that
 demographic


decline
 will
 start
 to
 bite
 in
 Europe,


Japan,
 and
 China.
 Trump's
 trade
 war
 will


start
 slow
 because
 Trump's
 most


aggressive
 tariff
 suggestions
 should
 be


seen
 as
 more
 of
 a
 negotiation
 tactic


than
 a
 real
 policy.
 And
 that
 Elon
 Musk's


Doge
 would
 probably
 not
 succeed
 because


it
 would
 be
 unlikely
 that
 he
 will
 figure


out
 American
 politics
 in
 just
 a
 year.
 My


next
 big
 predictions
 were
 that
 the


global
 economy
 will
 struggle,
 that


governments
 will
 face
 tough
 choices
 to


reign
 in
 debt,
 and
 finally
 that
 the


green
 energy
 revolution
 will
 continue
 to


amaze.
 Now,
 looking
 back,
 all
 of
 these


predictions
 actually
 materialized.
 The


global
 economy
 again
 had
 a
 disappointing


year.
 Europe
 and
 Japan
 grew
 especially


slowly.
 Governments
 from
 France
 to


Brazil
 to
 the
 UK,
 which
 I
 had
 mentioned


as
 being
 especially
 risky
 last
 year


faced
 that
 crisis.
 And
 as
 you
 can
 see


here,
 while
 the
 Trump
 trade
 war
 chaos


came
 very
 quickly,
 most
 of
 it
 was
 part


of
 his
 negotiation
 strategy
 as
 actual


tariffs
 only
 followed
 slowly.
 Finally,


on
 the
 bright
 side,
 the
 green
 energy


revolution
 powered
 ahead
 as
 2025
 EV,


solar,
 and
 wind
 turbine
 adoption
 are


again
 on
 track
 for
 yet
 another
 record


year.
 Actually,
 the
 only
 prediction
 that


I
 got
 really
 wrong
 was
 that
 most
 of
 my


predictions
 will
 not
 come
 true.
 Which


honestly
 got
 me
 thinking,
 why
 did
 my


main
 predictions
 do
 so
 well
 last
 year


given
 that
 economists
 have
 such
 a
 bad


reputation
 making
 predictions
 and
 that
 I


myself
 said
 last
 year
 that
 a
 nonhuman


complex
 system
 like
 for
 example
 the


weather
 can
 only
 be
 reliably
 predicted


for
 just
 a
 few
 days
 ahead.
 The
 outcome


of
 a
 really
 small
 human
 complex
 system


like
 a
 sports
 game
 is
 also
 notoriously


hard
 to
 predict
 by
 both
 experts
 and


scientists.
 So
 to
 think
 that
 anyone
 can


reliably
 predict
 the
 global
 economy
 for


a
 full
 year
 ahead
 is
 frankly
 madness.


Well,
 actually
 if
 we
 look
 at
 stuff
 like


financial
 markets
 or
 big
 geopolitical


events,
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 says
 these
 are


indeed
 fundamentally
 unpredictable.


However,
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 big
 macro


trends
 such
 as
 globalization
 or


deglobalization,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 here,


actually
 these
 trends
 are
 pretty


predictable.
 And
 that's
 what
 I
 mostly


predicted
 last
 year,
 right?
 Big
 macro


tense
 that
 are
 already
 reshaping
 the


world.
 They
 will
 continue
 to
 do
 so
 next


year.
 So,
 to
 switch
 things
 up
 a
 little


bit
 this
 year,
 I'll
 take
 some
 more
 risks


such
 as
 with
 my
 bubble
 and
 Taiwan


blockade
 predictions.
 But
 first,
 let's


get
 into
 a
 prediction
 that
 I'm
 actually


very
 confident
 about.
 Prediction
 number


one,
 China
 will
 dominate
 more
 and
 more


industries.
 Now
 the
 core
 of
 this


prediction
 is
 that
 after
 musling
 their


way
 into
 the
 smartphone
 industry,
 ship


building
 industry,
 battery
 industry,


drone
 industry,
 and
 car
 industry,
 China


will
 challenge
 previously
 untouchable


Western
 giants
 like
 Elon
 Musk's
 SpaceX


in
 2026.
 Yes,
 Elon,
 sorry,
 it's


happening
 again.
 When
 Tesla
 entered
 the


Chinese
 market
 in
 2018,
 it
 was
 the
 most


advanced
 EV
 company
 by
 far.
 But
 now
 it's


playing
 catch-up
 with
 hundreds
 of


Chinese
 car
 brands
 like
 Yang
 Wang,


Xiaomi,
 Zeer,
 MG,
 and
 many,
 many
 more.


Yes,
 in
 2026,
 China
 is
 challenging


SpaceX
 in
 the
 space
 sector.
 But
 that's


not
 all.
 It's
 going
 after
 Nvidia
 in
 the


advanced
 chip
 sector,
 Fiser
 and
 Nova


Nordisk
 in
 the
 bioarm
 pharmacy
 sector,


Germany's
 BASF
 in
 the
 chemical
 sector,


and
 the
 German
 middle
 in
 general
 when
 it


comes
 to
 making
 advanced
 machines.


Tennis
 increased
 dominance
 is
 one
 of


these
 relatively
 predictable
 macro


trends.
 So,
 I'm
 pretty
 confident
 in
 this


prediction,
 giving
 it
 an
 80%


probability.
 But
 importantly,
 I
 don't


know
 which
 of
 these
 sectors
 the
 Chinese


will
 dominate
 next
 year.
 A
 lot
 of


China's
 incredible
 industrial
 successes


are
 the
 result
 of
 the
 country
 getting


richer.
 When
 Europe
 got
 rich,
 when
 Japan


got
 rich,
 when
 Korea
 got
 rich,
 they
 all


naturally
 started
 to
 compete
 globally
 in


advanced
 industries.
 What
 differentiates


China
 though
 is
 that
 its
 government
 is


making
 these
 5-year
 plans
 in
 which
 they


first
 boost
 specific
 sectors
 with


subsidies
 in
 such
 a
 way
 that
 it
 creates


intense
 competition.
 Then
 second,
 they


let
 this
 intense
 competition
 process


play
 out
 and
 they
 stop
 subsidizing
 as


much.
 Then
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 fail.
 But


the
 toughest
 ones
 who
 have
 survived
 this


process
 of
 intense
 competitions,
 these


emerge
 as
 worldclass
 companies.
 This


process
 has
 yielded
 China
 some


incredible
 results.
 In
 2006,
 the
 Chinese


government
 started
 heavily
 supporting


the
 ship
 building
 industry.
 Today,
 China


dominates
 the
 ship
 building
 industry.
 In


2015,
 China
 explicitly
 started
 targeting


the
 battery,
 solar,
 and
 EV
 industries.


Today,
 China
 dominates
 all
 of
 them.
 But


importantly,
 China's
 process
 does
 not


always
 work
 for
 each
 sector.
 For


example,
 China
 has
 previously
 also


targeted
 airplane
 manufacturing
 of
 the


type
 currently
 done
 by
 Boeing
 and


Airbus.
 So
 far,
 their
 efforts
 have


largely
 failed.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 China


will
 dominate
 all
 of
 these
 sectors
 in


2026,
 but
 I
 am
 saying
 with
 80%


confidence
 that
 China
 will
 dominate
 more


and
 more
 industries
 in
 2026.
 But,
 of


course,
 this
 will
 invoke
 a
 response,


which
 leads
 us
 to
 prediction
 number
 two.


The
 trade
 war
 will
 broaden.
 You
 see,


just
 as
 Trump's
 trade
 war
 was
 a
 response


to
 Chinese
 subsidies
 already
 in
 2025,


more
 and
 more
 countries
 responded
 to


perceived
 unfair
 competition
 from
 China


with
 tariffs
 such
 as
 Brazil's
 steel


tariffs,
 Mexico's
 car
 and
 good
 tariffs


or
 with
 nationalization
 such
 as
 the


Dutch
 nationalization
 of
 Chinese-owned


chip
 maker
 Nexia.
 In
 2026,
 I
 predict


that
 this
 trend
 will
 continue
 for
 two


reasons.
 The
 first
 is
 that
 China's


incredible
 manufacturing
 machine
 starts


with
 initial
 government
 subsidies.


Therefore,
 many
 advanced
 manufacturing


nations
 view
 Chinese
 competition
 as


unfair
 and
 they
 feel
 they
 have
 to


respond
 to
 protect
 their
 industries
 that


were
 not
 subsidized
 to
 the
 same
 extent.


The
 second
 reason
 is
 that
 China
 is


breaking
 the
 traditional
 Asian
 growth


model
 known
 as
 the
 flying
 geese
 economic


model.
 In
 a
 nutshell,
 the
 flying
 geese


model
 states
 that
 as
 Asian
 countries


gets
 rich,
 they
 move
 up
 the
 value
 chain.


China
 is
 doing
 that
 just
 as
 Japan
 and


Korea
 have
 done
 before
 it.
 However,


according
 to
 the
 flying
 geese
 model,
 as


Asian
 countries
 get
 richer,
 they


naturally
 will
 become
 too
 expensive
 for


low
 wage
 simple
 manufacturing


industries.
 Therefore,
 Japan
 moved
 a
 lot


of
 its
 lowcost
 manufacturing
 to
 Korea


and
 Taiwan,
 giving
 them
 a
 chance
 to


develop.
 Korea
 and
 Taiwan
 then
 did
 the


same
 for
 China.
 But
 now
 China
 is


breaking
 that
 pattern.
 Its
 national


security
 strategy
 is
 about
 becoming


self-reliant
 in
 all
 of
 manufacturing.


Therefore,
 it's
 now
 promoting
 factory


automation
 which
 helps
 to
 keep
 simple


manufacturing
 stuff
 like
 pencil


manufacturing
 for
 example
 in
 China


despite
 rising
 wages
 in
 China.
 So


through
 its
 policy
 of
 self-reliance,


China
 is
 now
 threatening
 both
 industries


in
 advanced
 and
 developing
 nations.
 This


is
 why
 I
 predict
 the
 trend
 of
 both


developing
 nations
 like
 Brazil,
 Mexico


and
 India
 as
 well
 as
 advanced
 nations


like
 the
 Netherlands
 and
 Canada
 hitting


China
 with
 more
 and
 more
 tariffs
 or


other
 restrictions
 will
 continue.
 But


hold
 on,
 that
 wasn't
 my
 full
 prediction.


I
 said
 the
 trade
 war
 will
 broaden
 in


general,
 not
 against
 China
 per
 se.
 This


means
 that
 I
 predict
 in
 2026
 nations


will
 start
 hitting
 more
 countries
 with


tariffs
 and
 other
 barriers
 than
 just


China.
 Again,
 this
 is
 already
 happening


to
 an
 extent.
 Mexico
 did
 not
 just
 hit


China
 with
 tariffs.
 It
 hit
 India
 with


those
 tariffs
 as
 well.
 This
 is
 not


surprising.
 As
 I
 talked
 about
 in
 my


multipolar
 order
 video,
 one
 of
 the
 main


predictions
 of
 the
 emerging
 field
 of


geoeconomics
 is
 that
 as
 we
 transition


from
 a
 world
 dominated
 by
 one
 superpower


to
 one
 by
 multiple
 great
 powers,
 it's


likely
 that
 we
 see
 more
 use
 of
 economic


weapons
 like
 tariffs,
 sanctions,
 and


other
 economic
 weapons
 as
 countries


experiment
 with
 how
 far
 they
 can
 go
 in


this
 new
 economic
 order
 before
 facing


blowback.
 Still,
 I'm
 only
 giving
 this


prediction
 a
 60%
 probability.
 The
 reason


has
 to
 do
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 while
 mega


trends
 like
 this
 are
 quite
 predictable


over
 the
 long
 term,
 you
 could
 very
 well


have
 multiple
 years
 of
 small
 reversals.


For
 example,
 let's
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at


the
 deglobalization
 mega
 trend
 in
 the


1920s
 and
 30s.
 Actually,
 there
 were


quite
 a
 few
 years
 where
 international


trade
 recovered
 before
 following
 the


deglobalization
 mega
 trend
 again.
 2025


was
 an
 exceptionally
 tariff-heavy
 year,


mostly
 coming
 from
 Trump
 in
 the
 US


coupled
 with
 retaliation
 from
 China.
 But


both
 countries
 have
 seen
 that
 they
 are


actually
 quite
 exposed
 to
 each
 other.
 So


it
 could
 be
 that
 20
 26
 will
 be
 a


correction
 year
 making
 my
 prediction
 of


a
 broader
 trade
 war
 wrong.
 In
 that
 sense


I'm
 more
 confident
 about
 prediction


number
 three.
 Government
 debt
 will


increasingly
 be
 a
 limit.
 Indeed
 this
 is


basically
 the
 same
 prediction
 as
 I
 made


last
 year.
 The
 reason
 for
 it
 is
 simple.


The
 world
 continues
 to
 age.
 The
 world
 is


used
 to
 using
 stimulus
 to
 get
 out
 of


crisis.
 Last
 year,
 wear
 governments
 like


the
 UK
 and
 French
 governments
 changed


spending
 plans
 as
 a
 consequence
 of
 their


high
 debt
 and
 increasing
 interest
 rates.


But
 they
 did
 not
 tackle
 the
 underlying


issue,
 which
 is
 that
 France
 and
 the
 UK


spend
 way
 more
 than
 other
 countries
 on


pensioners.
 To
 raise
 the
 pension
 age
 by


a
 lot
 or
 reduce
 pension
 payments,
 that


was
 politically
 unacceptable.
 The
 more


people
 age,
 the
 more
 difficult
 it
 will


become
 for
 democracies
 to
 lower


pensions.
 given
 that
 more
 and
 more


voters
 receive
 these
 pensions
 or
 will
 do


so
 soon.
 Global
 public
 debt
 compared
 to


GDP
 in
 advanced
 economies
 is
 now
 higher


than
 it
 was
 during
 the
 First
 World
 War


at
 levels
 only
 seen
 during
 the
 times
 of


Napoleon.
 Therefore,
 I
 think
 there's
 an


85%
 chance
 that
 just
 like
 last
 year,


several
 high
 debt,
 rapidly
 aging


countries
 will
 again
 have
 to
 make
 tough


choices
 to
 deal
 with
 this
 debt
 or
 face


increased
 inflation
 or
 a
 falling


currency
 like
 Japan
 did.
 Luckily,
 this


could
 be
 offset
 a
 little
 by
 my
 fourth


prediction,
 which
 is
 prediction
 number


four.
 The
 AI
 bubble
 will
 not
 burst
 yet.


The
 AI
 bubble.
 AI
 bubble.


>> AI
 bubble.
 Yes,
 people
 are
 still


investing
 enormous
 amounts
 of
 money
 into


the
 AI
 sector.
 Yes,
 there
 are
 clear


parallels
 to
 the
 2000
 internet.com


bubble
 where
 despite
 the
 genuine
 promise


of
 the
 technology
 of
 the
 internet,


people
 still
 got
 way
 too
 excited
 about
 a


lot
 of
 internet
 companies
 at
 the
 time.


>> When
 the
 ball
 drops
 on
 the
 year
 2000,
 it


will
 be
 a
 momentous
 event
 for
 the
 world


and
 for
 the
 US
 economy,
 which
 is
 closing


in
 on
 its
 longest
 expansion
 ever.


We
 just
 saw
 this
 as
 a
 unique
 opportunity


to
 combine
 forces
 with
 the
 leading
 brand


on
 the
 internet.
 And
 that's
 an


opportunity
 just
 don't
 pass
 up.


>> Yes,
 AI,
 just
 like
 the
 internet
 then
 is


really
 changing
 how
 people
 work.
 And


yes,
 just
 like
 internet
 adoption
 in


2001,
 AI
 adoption
 is
 still
 in
 its


infancy.
 However,
 that
 does
 not
 mean


that
 the
 companies
 that
 investors
 are


betting
 big
 on
 today,
 like
 unproven


billion-dollar
 startups,
 or
 even
 giants


like
 OpenAI
 and
 Nvidia,
 will
 make
 enough


money
 in
 the
 future
 to
 justify
 their


incredibly
 high
 stock
 prices
 today.


Serious
 research
 firms
 like
 Bane
 and
 JP


Morgan
 have
 calculated
 that
 AI
 companies


need
 to
 make
 so
 much
 more
 money
 in
 the


upcoming
 years
 to
 justify
 their
 current


valuations
 that
 it
 seems
 clear
 that


there
 is
 a
 bubble
 today.
 However,
 the
 AI


industry
 today
 is
 different
 than
 the


internet
 industry
 in
 2001
 for
 two


reasons.
 First,
 some
 of
 the
 most


valuable
 companies
 today
 like
 OpenAI
 do


have
 unprecedented
 numbers
 of
 active


users.
 I
 mean,
 OpenAI
 already
 has
 double


the
 number
 of
 users
 than
 Netflix
 and
 its


valuation
 is
 just
 above
 that
 of
 Netflix.


Of
 course,
 OpenAI
 has
 not
 proven
 that
 it


can
 get
 many
 of
 its
 users
 to
 pay
 as
 much


as
 they
 do
 Netflix
 yet.
 And
 this
 brings


us
 to
 reason
 number
 two.
 If
 we
 compare


US
 stock
 price
 today
 compared
 to


earnings
 that
 they
 actually
 earn,
 the


picture
 still
 looks
 much
 less
 like
 a


bubble
 than
 it
 did
 in
 2001,
 especially


when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 biggest
 winner
 now,


Nvidia.
 They
 are
 already
 earning
 the


revenue
 now
 that
 justifies
 their
 high


stock
 price.
 Yes,
 some
 have
 pointed
 out


that
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 finance


each
 other.
 That
 could
 be
 risky,


absolutely.
 But
 it
 could
 also
 be


completely
 rational
 if
 these
 companies


live
 up
 to
 their
 promise.
 So,
 in
 theory,


this
 bubble
 could
 grow
 quite
 a
 bit


further.
 It
 could
 pop
 in
 2027.
 Maybe


that's
 a
 25%
 chance.
 It
 could
 pop
 in


2028.
 Maybe
 that's
 a
 20%
 chance.
 Maybe


it
 could
 pop
 later
 or
 never
 at
 all.


Let's
 give
 that
 a
 30%
 chance.
 If
 we
 do


that,
 then
 actually
 the
 chance
 that
 it


pops
 next
 year
 is
 pretty
 low.
 So,
 my


argument
 is
 this.
 Yes,
 we
 see
 signs
 of
 a


bubble,
 but
 looking
 back
 at
 the
 Chinese


real
 estate
 bubble,
 for example,
 that


was
 called
 already
 in
 2015
 and
 didn't


pop
 for
 five
 more
 years,
 then
 it's
 very


unlikely
 that
 the
 AI
 bubble
 will
 pop
 in


2026.


Although,
 my
 final
 prediction
 could
 ruin


that
 prediction
 as
 it
 may
 tank
 the


global
 economy.
 Let's
 talk
 about


prediction
 number
 five.
 China
 will


blockade
 or
 quarantine
 Taiwan.
 Okay,


folks,
 let's
 just
 be
 honest
 here.
 I
 am


an
 economist.
 What
 do
 I
 know
 about


geopolitics?
 Well,
 since
 Russia's


invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 ruined
 all
 inflation


predictions
 in
 2022,
 economists
 like
 me


have
 been
 forced
 to
 adapt.
 Since
 then,
 I


intensely
 follow
 experts
 on
 geopolitics,


such
 as
 the
 folks
 at
 the
 Center
 for


Strategic
 and
 International
 Studies.


Now,
 alarmingly,
 in
 a
 recent
 report,


they
 pulled
 35
 Taiwanese
 experts
 and
 52


US
 experts,
 and
 most
 of
 them
 thought


that
 while
 China
 does
 not
 have
 the


capability
 to
 invade
 Taiwan
 yet,
 they
 do


have
 the
 capability
 to
 isolate
 it
 from


the
 outside
 world
 through
 a
 naval


blockade,
 which
 could
 the


island.
 A
 blockade
 means
 that
 China


would
 block
 all
 entry
 to
 Taiwan
 via
 the


sea
 and
 potentially
 air.
 Under


international
 law,
 a
 blockade
 against


another
 nation
 is
 considered
 an
 act
 of


war.
 However,
 only
 a
 few
 nations


recognize
 Taiwan
 as
 a
 nation.
 So,
 if


Taiwan
 is
 not
 a
 nation,
 then
 maybe
 its


coastline
 is
 simply
 Chinese
 waters.
 So,


what
 if
 the
 Chinese
 Coast
 Guard
 just


sails
 into
 Taiwanese
 waters
 and
 starts


demanding
 to
 inspect
 and
 potentially


authorize
 all
 incoming
 and
 outgoing


ships?
 As
 you
 can
 see
 here,
 the
 experts


overwhelmingly
 think
 the
 Chinese
 Coast


Guard
 is
 ready
 to
 enforce
 such
 a


quarantine
 of
 Taiwan
 tomorrow
 if
 it


wants
 to.
 As
 you
 can
 see
 in
 this
 graph


from
 a
 CSIS


war
 game,
 a
 Chinese
 blockade
 would
 cause


Taiwan
 to
 run
 out
 of
 gas
 in
 just
 3


weeks,
 run
 out
 of
 coal
 in
 8,
 oil
 in
 15,


and
 this
 all
 would
 the
 economy


of
 Taiwan
 in
 no
 time.
 And
 there
 are
 very


worrying
 signs
 indeed
 that
 China
 has


been
 preparing
 all
 year
 for
 such
 a


blockade.
 In
 the
 summer,
 it
 did
 blockade


like
 military
 exercises.
 In
 July,
 they


escalated
 their
 military
 moves
 in
 the


entire
 region.
 And
 in
 November,
 they


expanded
 their
 navy
 with
 a
 new


state-of-the-art
 aircraft
 carrier.


Combine
 this
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 the


Chinese
 manufacturing
 economy
 is
 riding


relatively
 high
 right
 now,
 the
 US
 is


distracted
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 and
 in


Venezuela,
 and
 that
 China's
 population


will
 soon
 start
 dropping.
 Well,
 with
 all


of
 those
 factors,
 it's
 not
 hard
 to
 make


the
 argument
 that
 the
 chance
 of
 a


Chinese
 quarantine
 or
 blockade
 in
 2026


is
 higher
 than
 ever.
 And
 dang,
 the


consequences
 on
 this
 one
 could
 be


horrible
 for
 the
 global
 economy.
 Of


course,
 it
 would
 be
 horrible
 for
 the


people
 of
 Taiwan
 first
 and
 foremost.
 On


top
 of
 that,
 a
 quarantine
 has
 a
 high


likelihood
 to
 escalate
 eventually
 into
 a


blockade,
 which
 in
 turn
 could
 lead
 to
 a


war.
 This
 all
 of
 course
 then
 could
 lead


to
 way
 more
 sanctions,
 which
 would
 be


truly
 devastating
 for
 the
 global
 economy


as
 the
 West
 crucially
 depends
 on
 China


for
 rare
 earths,
 many
 minerals,
 and
 a


lot
 of
 manufacturing
 in
 general.
 In


fact,
 the
 consequences
 for
 the
 West


could
 be
 so
 bad
 that
 they
 could
 decide


that
 actually
 it's
 not
 worth
 it
 to
 fight


a
 Chinese
 reunification
 at
 all.
 If
 the


Trump
 team
 caved
 over
 Chinese
 rare
 earth


magnet
 restrictions
 so
 quickly
 in
 the


trade
 war,
 perhaps
 he
 will
 just
 let


China
 have
 a
 quarantine
 around
 Taiwan
 as


well.
 It's
 a
 real
 possibility.
 I
 am


including
 it
 in
 my
 predictions
 this


year,
 even
 though
 I
 only
 give
 it
 a
 25%


probability.
 But
 wait,
 at
 25%


probability.
 So
 then
 why
 predict
 it?


Well,
 last
 year
 I
 did
 what
 all


economists
 typically
 do,
 make


predictions
 that
 are
 relatively
 safe


based
 on
 mega
 trends.
 That's
 why
 I
 got


them
 all
 right.
 But
 the
 goal
 of
 this


video
 is
 ultimately
 not
 to
 get


everything
 right,
 per
 se.
 It's
 to
 help


the
 viewer,
 you
 to
 think
 about
 what


could
 most
 impact
 the
 global
 economy
 in


2026.
 Now,
 to
 achieve
 that
 goal,
 I
 felt


it
 was
 essential
 to
 make
 also
 some


riskier
 predictions.
 this
 time
 given
 how


big
 the
 consequences
 could
 be.
 But
 yeah,


let
 me
 know.
 Did
 I
 succeed
 in
 that?
 Did


this
 video
 give
 you
 a
 more
 informed
 look


at
 2026?
 If
 so,
 I
 have
 good
 news
 for


you.
 I
 have
 the
 perfect
 follow-up.
