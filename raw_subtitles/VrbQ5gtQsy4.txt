From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Thursday,
 February
 26th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


A
 new
 review
 by
 the
 Times
 of
 documents


from
 the
 Epstein
 files
 shows
 that
 the


Justice
 Department
 left
 out
 key


materials
 related
 to
 a
 woman
 who
 said


Epstein
 and
 President
 Trump
 sexually


assaulted
 her
 when
 she
 was
 a
 minor.
 An


index
 in
 the
 files
 revealed
 that
 the
 FBI


had
 conducted
 four
 interviews
 in


connection
 with
 her
 claims
 and
 wrote


summaries
 about
 each
 one,
 but
 only
 one


of
 those
 summaries,
 which
 describes
 her


accusations
 against
 Epstein,
 was


released.
 The
 other
 memos,
 more
 than
 50


pages
 of
 material,
 are
 missing.
 The


public
 files
 do
 contain
 one
 description


of
 her
 account
 about
 Trump
 in
 which


federal
 officials
 wrote
 that
 she
 claimed


Trump
 assaulted
 her
 in
 a
 violent
 and


lurid
 encounter
 in
 the
 mid1
 1980s
 when


she
 was
 roughly
 14
 years
 old.
 The
 files


don't
 include
 any
 assessment
 about
 the


credibility
 of
 her
 accusation.
 The
 DOJ


had
 previously
 said
 there
 were
 unfounded


and
 false
 claims
 about
 Trump
 in
 the


files
 and
 a
 White
 House
 spokeswoman
 said


this
 week
 that
 the
 president
 has
 been


quote
 totally
 exonerated
 on
 anything


relating
 to
 Epstein
 in
 response
 to


questions
 from
 the
 Times
 about
 why
 the


files
 related
 to
 the
 woman
 were
 not


released.
 The
 Justice
 Department
 has


given
 various
 responses
 over
 the
 past


few
 days.
 It
 first
 said
 that
 the
 only


materials
 it
 withheld
 were
 either


duplicates
 or
 privileged
 information.
 It


now
 says
 it's
 reviewing
 the
 files
 and


that
 it
 will
 publish
 any
 documents
 it


should
 have
 made
 public.
 Under
 a
 law


passed
 by
 Congress
 last
 year,
 the
 DOJ


can
 only
 redact
 material
 from
 the


Epstein
 files
 in
 limited
 scenarios,
 like


if
 it
 could
 be
 used
 to
 identify
 victims


or
 would
 jeopardize
 an
 ongoing


investigation.
 The
 law
 specifically


forbids
 federal
 officials
 from


withholding
 materials
 to
 protect
 public


figures,
 quote,
 on
 the
 basis
 of


embarrassment,
 reputational
 harm,
 or


political
 sensitivity.
 The
 top
 Democrat


on
 the
 House
 Oversight
 Committee,


Representative
 Robert
 Garcia
 of


California,
 said
 the
 Justice
 Department


had
 not
 provided
 a
 proper
 explanation


for
 why
 the
 materials
 related
 to
 Trump


are
 missing.
 Democrats
 plan
 to
 open
 an


investigation
 into
 the
 matter.


Today,
 the
 US
 and
 Iran
 will
 meet
 for
 a


highstakes
 round
 of
 nuclear


negotiations,
 and
 the
 outcome
 could


determine
 whether
 or
 not
 President
 Trump


attacks
 the
 country.
 Trump
 has
 demanded


Iran
 give
 up
 its
 nuclear
 ambitions


entirely,
 and
 he's
 moved
 a
 massive
 array


of
 firepower
 to
 the
 region
 to
 back
 that


up.
 Iran
 has
 refused,
 but
 it's
 now


coming
 to
 the
 table
 with
 a
 compromise.


Iranian
 officials
 tell
 the
 Times
 the


country
 plans
 to
 make
 an
 offer
 that


would
 allow
 Trump
 to
 declare
 victory


while
 still
 letting
 Iran
 maintain
 some


level
 of
 nuclear
 enrichment.
 The


country's
 leaders
 insist
 it's
 not
 trying


to
 develop
 a
 nuclear
 weapon,
 but
 they


want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 use
 nuclear
 material


for
 medical
 purposes,
 like
 cancer


treatment
 studies.
 Iran's
 also
 trying
 to


sweeten
 the
 deal
 with
 a
 pledge
 to
 buy


American
 goods
 like
 airplanes
 and
 an


invitation
 for
 American
 companies
 to


invest
 in
 Iran's
 oil
 and
 gas
 industries.


Their
 hope
 is
 that
 the
 US
 could
 also


lift
 the
 economic
 sanctions
 that
 have


pushed
 Iran's
 economy
 to
 near
 collapse.


One
 expert
 on
 US
 Middle
 East
 relations


told
 the
 Times
 that
 today
 will
 be
 the


day
 for
 both
 sides
 to
 lay
 all
 their


cards
 out
 on
 the
 table.
 And
 quote,
 "If


Iran
 doesn't
 show
 enough
 willingness
 to


compromise
 and
 the
 US
 doesn't
 show


willingness
 to
 provide
 enough
 sanctions


relief,
 things
 are
 going
 to
 explode."


Now,
 two
 other
 quick
 updates
 on
 the


Trump
 administration.
 Do
 you
 believe


that
 there's
 no
 evidence
 that
 the
 flu


vaccine
 has
 efficacy
 in
 reducing
 serious


injury
 or
 hospitalization?
 I


>> I
 I


>> This
 is
 an
 easy
 one,
 doctor.


>> This
 is
 an
 easy
 one.


>> On
 Capitol
 Hill
 yesterday,
 the
 Senate


Health
 Committee
 held
 a
 confirmation


hearing
 for
 Casey
 Means,
 President


Trump's
 nominee
 for
 US
 Surgeon
 General.


Means,
 an
 author
 and
 wellness


influencer,
 has
 been
 a
 key
 figure
 in


health
 secretary
 Robert
 F.
 Kennedy
 Jr.'s


Make
 America
 Healthy
 Again
 movement.


Over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 hearing,
 Means


largely
 deflected
 specific
 questions


about
 hot
 button
 maha
 issues
 like


pesticides,
 birth
 control,
 and
 vaccines.


Instead,
 she
 focused
 on
 how,
 in
 her


view,
 Americans
 are
 suffering
 from
 an


epidemic
 of
 chronic
 diseases
 linked
 to


ultrarocessed
 foods,
 chemicals,
 stress,


and
 lack
 of
 exercise.
 I
 think
 what's


really
 striking
 is
 that
 part
 of
 why
 RFK


said
 that
 he
 wanted
 her
 to
 be
 surgeon


general
 is
 because
 she's
 rejected
 the


traditional
 medical
 system.
 Danny
 Bloom


is
 a
 health
 reporter
 at
 the
 times.
 She


says
 that
 means
 is
 a
 highly


unconventional
 pick
 for
 the
 role
 as
 the


nation's
 doctor
 as
 the
 surgeon
 general


is
 called.
 That's
 in
 large
 part
 because


while
 she
 graduated
 from
 medical
 school,


she
 doesn't
 have
 an
 active
 medical


license.
 A
 lot
 of
 her
 supporters
 say


that
 that
 is
 precisely
 the
 kind
 of


person
 we
 need
 in
 charge,
 someone
 who


has
 been
 inside
 the
 medical
 system.
 And


so
 in
 theory
 knows
 a
 bit
 about
 how
 to


dismantle
 it.
 But
 a
 lot
 of
 critics
 also


think
 that
 that
 level
 of
 distrust
 and


that
 sort
 of
 condemnation
 of
 the
 medical


system
 is
 exactly
 why
 she
 shouldn't
 have


this
 role.
 The
 Republican
 controlled


health
 committee
 is
 expected
 to


greenlight
 Means's
 nomination,
 sending


it
 to
 the
 full
 Senate
 for
 a
 final


confirmation
 vote.


Also,
 the
 Times
 has
 learned
 that
 Cash


Patel,
 the
 director
 of
 the
 FBI,
 has


fired
 about
 10
 employees
 who
 worked
 on


the
 investigation
 into
 President
 Trump's


handling
 of
 classified
 documents.
 Back


in
 2022,
 the
 FBI
 searched
 Mara
 Lago
 as


part
 of
 an
 inquiry
 into
 whether
 Trump


broke
 the
 law
 by
 keeping
 sensitive


national
 security
 records
 after
 his


first
 term
 ended
 and
 whether
 he


obstructed
 the
 government's
 repeated


efforts
 to
 get
 them
 back.
 Reuters


revealed
 this
 week
 that
 Patel's
 own


phone
 records
 were
 subpoenenaed
 as
 part


of
 that
 investigation.
 He
 was
 a
 close


Trump
 adviser
 at
 the
 time.
 Now,
 in
 his


position
 as
 head
 of
 the
 FBI,
 Patel
 has


carried
 out
 a
 rolling
 barrage
 of


retribution
 against
 people
 who


investigated
 Trump.
 In
 some
 cases,


agents
 who've
 been
 fired
 and
 their


lawyers
 say
 that
 Patel
 has
 violated


safeguards
 that
 were
 supposed
 to
 protect


FBI
 employees
 from
 politically
 motivated


dismissals.


Suffice
 it
 to
 say,
 it
 is
 highly
 unusual


to
 see
 shootouts


in
 open
 sea
 like
 that.
 It's
 not


something
 that
 happens
 every
 day.
 It's


something,
 frankly,
 that
 hasn't
 happened


with
 Cuba
 in
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 Secretary


of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio
 says
 the
 US
 is


trying
 to
 gather
 more
 information
 about


what
 Cuba
 is
 calling
 a
 deadly
 gunfight


just
 off
 the
 coast
 of
 the
 island.


>> The
 majority
 of
 the
 facts
 being
 publicly


reported
 are
 those
 provided
 by
 the


Cubans.
 We
 will
 verify
 that


independently.


>> According
 to
 Cuban
 state
 media,
 a


speedboat
 registered
 in
 Florida
 neared


Cuba
 yesterday
 and
 the
 people
 on
 board


fired
 at
 Cuban
 border
 guards.
 The
 guards


shot
 back.
 Four
 people
 on
 the
 speedboat


were
 killed
 and
 six
 were
 wounded.
 Cuban


authorities
 say
 the
 people
 on
 the
 boat


were
 armed
 Cuban
 nationals
 living
 in
 the


US.
 They
 had
 bulletproof
 jackets
 and


Molotov
 cocktails.
 The
 Cuban
 government


claims
 they
 were
 attempting
 quote
 an


infiltration
 with
 terrorist
 ends.
 When


asked
 whether
 it
 was
 a
 US
 government


operation
 or
 whether
 any
 American


personnel
 were
 involved,
 Rubio
 said
 no.


Carlos
 Himenez,
 a
 House
 Republican
 from


Florida,
 called
 it
 a
 massacre.
 Tensions


between
 the
 US
 and
 Cuba
 have
 been


escalating
 recently
 as
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 taken
 steps
 to


squeeze
 the
 communist
 regime.
 The
 US
 has


cut
 off
 foreign
 oil
 shipments
 and
 cut


off
 sources
 of
 income
 that
 had
 kept


Cuba's
 economy
 afloat.
 Conditions
 are


now
 deteriorating
 with
 rampant


inflation,
 gas
 shortages,
 lengthy


blackouts,
 and
 soaring
 food
 prices.
 All


of
 which
 is
 threatening
 to
 destabilize


the
 government
 there.


And
 finally,
 for
 a
 couple
 years
 there,


the
 real
 estate
 market
 in
 the
 US
 was


solidly
 a
 sellers
 market,
 almost


absurdly
 so.
 Buyers
 weren't
 just
 making


offers.
 They
 were
 having
 to
 desperately


woo
 the
 sellers.
 They'd
 write
 long
 love


notes
 to
 the
 house.
 They
 offered
 way


above
 asking
 price.
 They
 waved


inspections.
 One
 realtor
 said
 she
 even


saw
 a
 buyer
 offer
 the
 seller
 a
 puppy.


But
 things
 are
 swinging
 back.
 According


to
 one
 estimate,
 for
 every
 three
 people


trying
 to
 sell
 a
 house,
 there's
 now
 only


two
 people
 looking
 to
 buy.
 So
 buyers
 are


getting
 to
 be
 pickier.
 Houses
 are


sitting
 for
 longer.
 Sellers
 are
 the
 ones


feeling
 desperate,
 wondering
 if
 new


paint,
 fresh
 photos,
 staged
 furniture


will
 finally
 get
 them
 an
 offer.
 In
 terms


of
 why
 it
 shifted,
 basically
 some


sellers
 who
 didn't
 want
 to
 move
 because


they
 had
 such
 low
 interest
 rates
 have


now
 finally
 been
 forced
 to
 put
 their


homes
 on
 the
 market
 due
 to
 big
 life


events.
 It's
 what
 realtors
 call
 one
 of


the
 four
 Ds:
 diamonds,
 as
 in
 a
 wedding,


diapers,
 divorce,
 and
 death.
 Notably,


while
 the
 shift
 has
 helped
 bring
 housing


prices
 down
 a
 little,
 it's
 not
 enough


for
 many
 Americans.
 According
 to
 Zillow,


buyers
 now
 need
 almost
 twice
 the
 yearly


income
 than
 they
 did
 before
 the
 pandemic


to
 afford
 a
 typical
 home.
 Essentially,


it
 is
 a
 buyer
 market,
 but
 only
 if
 you


have
 the
 resources
 to
 buy.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.

 on
 the


Daily,

 the
