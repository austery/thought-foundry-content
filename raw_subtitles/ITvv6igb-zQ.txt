Welcome
 everyone
 to
 the
 OnPy
 podcast.


I'm
 John
 Michael
 McGrath


>> and
 I'm
 Jessica
 Smith
 Cross.


>> Today
 on
 the
 pod,
 the
 NDP
 have
 formally


asked
 the
 integrity
 commissioner
 to


investigate
 the
 labor
 minister
 as
 the


skills
 development
 fund
 controversy


continues.


>> Bill
 60
 passed
 through
 the
 legislature


and
 some
 are
 sounding
 the
 alarm
 about


water
 safety.


>> And
 if
 Ontario
 Place
 wasn't
 enough,
 now


we
 need
 to
 ask
 if
 the
 Ford
 government
 is


eyeing
 exhibition
 place
 as
 well.


>> It's
 November
 28th,
 2025.
 Let's
 get
 to


it.


Jessica
 Smith
 Cross,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


podcast.
 Supposed
 I
 have
 to
 do
 Steve's


job
 and
 sugar.


>> Even
 I,
 a
 a
 sports
 ignoramus
 knows
 what


a
 Toronto
 Maple
 Leafs
 shirt
 is.
 Yeah.


>> But
 uh
 why
 are
 you
 wearing
 that
 today?


>> It's
 not
 because
 I'm
 a
 fan.
 Because


John,
 I
 am
 I'm
 not
 a
 hockey
 fan.
 Not


even


>> because
 you
 enjoy
 pain
 and
 suffering.


>> No,
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 skills


development
 fund
 today.
 And
 there's
 a


Maple
 Leafs
 tie-in.
 So,
 when
 we
 uh
 said


we
 should
 do
 a
 fun
 shirt,
 I
 picked
 a
 fun


shirt.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 uh
 I
 am
 also
 tying
 uh
 my


shirt
 into
 and
 I'm
 wearing
 one
 of
 my


Godzilla
 t-shirts.
 Uh
 there
 we
 go.
 Um
 I


I
 own
 many
 Godzilla
 t-shirts.
 And
 I


think
 I
 might
 have
 to
 adopt
 a
 rule
 that


uh
 every
 week
 where
 there
 is
 um
 an


outburst
 of
 the
 kind
 that
 I
 think
 of
 as


as
 classic
 Doug
 Ford


>> uh
 that
 I
 will
 wear
 a
 Godzilla
 t-shirt


um
 because
 of
 the
 way
 he
 tends
 to
 sort


of
 traml
 through


>> an
 ode
 to
 Fordzilla.


>> Um
 and
 we
 will
 discuss
 that
 a
 bit
 later.


But
 yes,
 the
 the the
 premier
 had
 an


outburst
 this
 week.
 Um
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 we


we
 will
 uh
 discuss
 that
 uh
 in
 one
 of
 our


later
 segments.
 Uh
 so
 without
 further


ado,
 let's
 get
 to
 issue
 one.


The
 government's
 skills
 development
 fund


scandal
 continues
 this
 week
 with
 NDP


leader
 Mar
 Styles
 filing
 a
 complaint
 to


the
 province's
 integrity
 commissioner


that
 alleges
 Labor
 Minister
 David
 Pacini


may
 have
 broken
 provincial
 law
 while


overseeing
 the
 distribution
 of


provincial
 grants.
 Before
 we
 get
 to
 that


story
 though,
 I
 would
 love
 to
 get
 to
 the


story
 behind
 the
 story
 if
 we
 can.
 Uh


Jessica
 Trillium
 has
 really
 been
 leading


a
 lot
 of
 the
 coverage
 uh
 for
 the
 story


for
 weeks
 now
 and
 I'm
 hoping
 you
 can


tell
 us
 a
 bit
 of
 the
 background
 here.
 Uh


what
 got
 you
 started
 down
 this
 road?


>> I
 guess
 there
 were
 two
 different
 things.


Uh
 the
 first
 uh
 one
 of
 our
 reporters,


Charlie
 Pinkerton,
 had
 done
 an
 FOI


request,
 a
 freedom
 of
 information


request
 for
 some
 documents
 related
 to
 a


different
 story,
 but
 they
 turned
 up
 some


communications
 about
 the
 skills


development
 fund
 and
 a
 group
 that
 was


awarded
 funding.
 And
 what
 the
 email


showed
 was
 that
 the
 civil
 servants
 said


that
 it
 had
 the
 project
 had
 been
 scored


low
 in
 their
 assessment,
 but
 the


minister's
 office
 had
 decided
 to
 fund
 it


anyways.
 And
 this
 is
 something
 that
 like


months
 and
 months
 months
 later,
 the


auditor
 general
 would
 do
 a
 whole
 report


on
 became
 a
 big
 deal.
 But
 then
 it
 was


just
 this
 one
 group
 that
 we
 knew
 of
 and


he
 did
 a
 story.
 Now
 at
 around
 the
 same


time,
 we
 were
 hearing
 from
 sources
 stuff


like
 this
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 slush
 fund.
 You


guys
 should
 be
 looking
 into
 this.
 And
 in


the
 last
 election,
 you
 could
 see
 that
 a


lot
 of
 the
 labor
 groups
 that
 endorsed


the
 PCs
 also
 had
 gotten
 skills


development
 fund
 and
 and
 then
 were
 very


open
 about
 that.
 Like
 I
 was
 at
 the


campaign
 launch
 in
 Windsor.
 Talked
 to


one
 of
 the
 guys
 who'd
 been
 standing


behind
 the
 premier
 that
 day.
 It's
 like


why
 are
 you
 supporting
 the
 pre
 the


premier?
 Why
 are
 you
 supporting
 the
 PCs?


And
 the
 guy
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 they
 gave
 us


a
 bunch
 of
 money,
 right?
 Just


>> that'll
 do
 it."


>> So
 we
 agree
 with
 that.
 Like
 that's


great.
 This
 is
 what
 we
 want.
 So
 that's


fair
 enough.
 But
 so
 we
 started
 to
 look


into
 it.
 We
 made
 it
 basically
 a
 project


over
 the
 summer.
 Uh
 the
 first
 step
 was


getting
 a
 comprehensive
 list
 of
 who
 got


how
 much
 money,
 which
 we
 still
 haven't


actually
 quite
 hit.
 Um
 we
 had
 to
 FOI
 for


the
 latest
 rounds.
 Um
 and
 it
 just
 it
 was


a
 huge
 headache.
 But
 we
 got
 rounds
 four


and
 five
 and
 the
 list
 of
 funders
 fund


the
 groups
 that
 got
 funding
 earlier.
 And


then
 it
 was
 a
 matter
 of
 doing
 the


research.
 Who
 runs
 these
 groups?
 Who
 are


they?
 Uh
 what
 connections
 do
 they
 have


to
 the
 PCs
 or
 the
 government?
 um
 have


they
 who
 are
 their
 lobbyists?
 Uh
 how


have
 they
 donated
 money
 to
 the
 party?


And
 it
 was
 that
 kind
 of
 story
 that


really
 got
 got
 rolling.
 Then
 the
 AG's


report
 came
 out
 and
 then
 tips
 started


flowing
 in.
 So
 the
 stuff
 about
 the
 Leafs


game
 and
 Minister
 Pacini
 and
 the
 the


wedding
 in
 Paris
 and
 all
 that
 that
 that


came
 after
 we
 started
 just
 doing
 the


basic
 story
 about
 who
 got
 the
 money
 and


what
 connections
 they
 might
 have
 to
 the


government.


>> Right.
 Uh
 you
 mentioned
 the
 uh
 not


having
 the
 complete
 list
 quite
 yet.


You've
 foied
 it.
 uh
 you
 the
 trillium
 has


uh
 launched
 a
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 crowdfunding


effort
 to
 try
 and
 cover
 some
 of
 the


costs.
 Public
 may
 not
 always
 understand


that
 when
 media
 outlets
 file
 for
 a


freedom
 of
 information
 requests,
 it
 is


very
 common
 for
 the
 government
 to
 come


back
 and
 say,
 "Well,
 if
 you
 want
 all
 of


these
 documents,
 you
 have
 to
 pay,
 you


know,
 x
 dollars,
 you've
 been
 uh
 quoted
 a


very
 large
 sum."


>> Yes.
 Some
 So,
 we've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 FOI


requests.
 We
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 FOI
 requests.


Most
 of
 them
 we
 haven't
 a
 budget
 to


handle,
 but
 we
 did
 a
 series
 of
 requests


looking
 for
 communications
 uh
 and


documents
 related
 to
 it.
 Like
 a
 handful


of
 these
 groups
 that
 got
 funding
 that
 we


had
 learned
 early
 on
 had
 connections
 to


the
 government
 and
 stuff
 that
 had
 been


the
 focus
 of
 some
 of
 our
 reportings.
 Uh


the
 cost
 over
 $10,000
 for
 this
 handful


of
 requests.
 So
 we
 launched
 a


crowdfunding
 campaign
 where
 we're
 asking


voters,
 people,
 readers
 to
 to
 send
 in


some
 money
 if
 they
 want
 to
 see
 these


documents
 come
 to
 light
 and
 the
 our


commitment
 is
 to
 spend
 the
 money
 only
 on


fo
 the
 foi
 requests
 uh
 and
 to
 make
 them


public
 if
 when
 we
 get
 documents
 whatever


they
 happen
 to
 be
 and
 any
 stories
 that


we
 write
 on
 them
 will
 also
 be
 unpayweld.


>> Oh
 very
 nice.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 Now
 of
 course
 as
 I
 mentioned


earlier
 uh
 the
 NDP
 leader
 Mart
 Styles


has
 filed
 a
 complaint
 to
 the
 integrity


commissioner.


Previous
 complaints
 to
 the
 integrity


commissioner
 uh
 haven't
 amounted
 to
 much


for
 a
 very
 good
 reason.
 Uh
 the
 integrity


commissioner
 cannot
 actually
 impose
 uh


penalties
 on
 MPPPS
 even
 if
 they
 do
 find


breaches
 of
 the
 law.
 Uh
 folks
 might


remember
 from
 the
 green
 belt
 scandal


that
 Steve
 Clark
 was
 found
 to
 have


breached
 the
 Members
 Integrity
 Act
 in


2023.
 But
 it
 is
 up
 to
 the
 legislature
 to


hold
 a
 vote
 for
 uh
 any
 punishments
 for
 a


member.
 No
 such
 vote
 ever
 occurred.
 Then


we
 had
 an
 election.
 I
 think
 it's
 safe
 to


say
 that's
 a
 dead
 issue
 now.
 So
 far,
 do


you
 get
 any
 sense
 of
 whether
 the
 premier


is
 actually
 looking
 to
 distance
 himself


from
 this
 labor
 minister?


>> I
 will
 get
 to
 that,
 I
 swear.
 But
 first,


I
 I
 want
 to
 disagree
 with
 you
 about
 the


idea,
 okay,


>> about
 the
 integrity
 commissioner


reports,
 not
 like
 I
 agree
 with
 you.


You're
 right
 that
 they're
 not
 going
 to


see
 anybody
 kicked
 out
 of
 office.
 You're


absolutely
 right.
 Um,
 but
 when
 you
 look


at
 the
 green
 belt
 report,
 a
 lot
 of
 the


things
 that
 we
 know
 about
 what
 happened


in
 the
 whole
 Green
 Belt
 affair
 came
 from


the
 Integrity
 Commissioner's


investigation.
 the
 integrity


commissioner
 has
 the
 power
 to
 like


subpoena
 people
 in
 documents,
 can
 do


interviews
 under
 oath
 and
 can
 just
 get


to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 the
 facts
 of
 the
 matter


that
 uh
 journalists
 just
 just
 can't
 do


and
 that
 the
 auditor
 general
 just
 takes


a
 bigger
 broader
 look
 at
 it.
 So
 I
 think


it
 it
 is
 worthwhile
 and
 I
 and
 I


understand
 why
 um


>> why
 there's
 been
 such
 an
 emphasis
 from


the
 opposition
 parties
 lately
 on
 trying


to
 spur
 another
 integrity
 commissioner


report.
 But
 as
 to
 the
 question
 about


Ford
 standing
 by
 Pacini,
 absolutely.


He's
 uh
 he's
 standing
 by
 him
 firmly


right
 now.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 there's
 there's
 been
 no
 no


sign
 of
 any
 daylight.
 Um
 it
 wouldn't
 be


uh
 unusual
 if
 we
 did
 get
 a
 cabinet


shuffle
 in
 uh
 the
 next,
 you
 know,
 few


months,
 but
 um
 I
 I
 certainly
 uh
 all


public
 appearances
 are
 that
 uh
 the


premier
 is
 is
 is
 backing
 uh
 the


minister.
 Certainly,
 I
 mean,
 even
 like


we've
 seen
 this
 play
 before,
 right?
 when


the
 government
 wants
 to
 start
 um
 moving


a
 minister
 out
 of
 the
 spotlight
 like


they
 stop
 answering
 questions
 in


question
 period
 and
 no
 pacini
 is
 still


there
 answering
 questions
 in
 in
 question


period.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 suspect
 that
 uh
 at


least
 for
 now
 uh
 he's
 staying
 where
 he


is.
 Uh
 the
 NDP
 of
 course
 are
 not
 the


only
 opposition
 party
 in
 the
 legislature


and
 in
 the
 course
 of
 responding
 to
 uh


Liberal
 John
 Fraser
 uh
 Premier
 Ford
 on


Wednesday
 made
 the
 following
 threat
 to


some
 of
 his
 government's
 critics
 and
 I


believe
 we've
 got
 a
 clip.
 And
 you
 know


what
 else
 we're
 going
 to
 audit,
 Madam


Speaker?
 All
 these
 great
 organizations


that
 funnel
 money
 to
 ACORN
 like
 QP
 and


all
 the
 rest
 of
 them.
 But
 we
 give
 money


we
 give
 money
 to
 agencies
 and
 they


funnel
 it
 quietly
 to
 these
 left-wing


radical
 groups
 and
 they
 aren't
 using
 it


for
 what
 we
 thought
 they're
 going
 to
 use


it.
 But
 I
 promise
 the
 NDP
 we
 will
 be


auditing
 all
 these
 so-called
 charitable


organizations
 that
 are
 funneling
 money.


>> Just
 stay
 tuned
 on
 that
 one.


>> Uh
 that
 was
 Premier
 Ford
 earlier
 this


week.
 Uh
 now
 he
 said
 stay
 tuned
 on
 this


one.
 We
 did
 stay
 tuned
 uh
 even
 before


the
 day
 was
 out.
 They
 started
 walking


that
 statement
 back.
 But
 what
 did
 you


make
 of
 it,
 Jessica?


>> Uh
 that
 this
 is
 the
 reason
 you
 wore
 a


Godzilla
 shirt
 today.


>> Yes
 indeed.
 This
 is
 uh
 the
 case
 of,
 as
 I


say,
 classic
 Doug
 Ford,
 a
 bit
 of
 bluster


from
 the
 premier.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 I
 see
 that
 for
 sure.
 Uh


this,
 I
 think,
 was
 just
 him
 getting


ticked
 off
 by
 by
 being
 heckled
 by
 ACORN.


Uh
 his
 comment
 uh
 you
 know,
 get
 a
 job,


buddy.
 That


>> Yes,


>> he
 replied
 to
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 all
 this.


You
 know,
 it
 made
 international
 news.
 I


think
 he
 was
 ticked
 off.
 Uh,
 and
 the
 it


seemed
 like
 where
 he
 was
 going
 with
 this


was
 a
 threat
 to
 audit
 uh
 people
 who
 get


public
 funding,
 maybe
 allies
 of
 the
 NDP,


and
 find
 they'd
 been
 misusing
 it.
 But


then,
 as
 you
 said,
 he
 walked
 it,
 it
 was


never
 quite
 clear,
 and
 he
 walked
 it
 back


before
 it
 could
 be
 uh
 damaging
 to
 the


responsible
 government.
 You
 know,
 a


responsible
 government
 doesn't
 audit
 its


enemies
 and
 try
 to
 find
 things,
 right?


Yeah,
 he
 sort
 of
 suggested
 that
 but
 then


was
 like,
 "No,
 no,
 this
 is
 just
 a


regular
 course
 of
 audits
 that
 we
 do."


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 you
 know,
 maybe
 just
 to


give
 people
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 behind
 the
 scenes


here,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 at
 the
 legislature


that
 day
 after
 he
 made
 that
 statement


and
 and
 we
 were
 all
 gathered
 in
 the
 uh


hallway
 outside
 the
 chamber
 and
 the


members
 of
 the
 press
 gallery
 were
 asking


members
 of
 the
 premier
 staff
 like
 what


did
 he
 mean
 by
 that?
 And
 it
 it
 was
 not


forthcoming.
 It
 was
 I
 I
 think
 maybe
 they


were
 as
 surprised
 as
 anybody
 to
 hear


what
 the
 premier
 had
 said.
 Um,
 as
 you


say,
 like
 a
 a
 a
 responsible
 government


would
 not
 make
 these
 kinds
 of
 threats.


And
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 do
 a
 your
 column,


my
 column
 uh
 segment
 this
 week,
 but
 I
 I


will
 just
 say
 that
 I
 did
 write
 for
 TVO


about
 this
 because
 uh
 these
 kinds
 of


threats
 are
 are
 worrisome
 precisely


because
 the
 government
 has
 such


incredibly
 broad
 powers
 to
 uh


investigate
 people.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 we


learned
 very
 early
 on
 in
 the
 Ford


government,
 at least
 I
 did
 not
 know
 this


until
 2018
 when
 the
 Ford
 government
 uh


created,
 you
 may
 remember
 that
 um
 select


committee
 that
 they
 used
 to
 investigate


the
 fair
 hydro
 plan.


>> Something
 I
 learned
 during
 those


proceedings
 is
 that
 um
 Canadian
 citizens


do
 not
 have
 the
 right
 to
 remain
 silent


before
 a
 parliamentary
 committee.
 If
 you


do
 not
 answer
 a
 question
 from
 a
 a


parliamentary
 committee,
 uh
 you
 are
 in


contempt
 of
 parliament
 and
 that
 can
 face


very
 serious
 penalties.
 the
 the


government,
 the
 legislature,
 they
 have


enormous
 powers.
 People
 should
 not
 make


idle
 threats.
 Uh
 I
 I
 will
 leave
 that
 uh


uh
 there.
 Um
 now,
 why
 of
 course
 was
 the


premier
 so
 exercised
 about
 QP
 and
 ACORN?


Uh
 because
 they
 were
 among
 the
 groups,


as
 you
 mentioned,
 protesting
 the
 uh


passage
 of
 a
 particular
 bill
 uh
 at
 the


legislature
 on
 Monday.
 And
 which
 bill


was
 that?
 For
 that,
 we
 will
 go
 to
 issue


two.


Bill
 60,
 the
 Fighting
 Delays
 Building


Faster
 Act,
 passed
 its
 third
 reading
 at


the
 legislature
 on
 Monday.
 We've
 talked


about
 the
 impact
 of
 Bill
 60
 on
 renters


before,
 including
 in
 last
 week's


podcast,
 but
 one
 section
 of
 the
 bill
 has


to
 do
 with
 water
 infrastructure
 in
 Peele


region,
 and
 it's
 got
 some
 people
 raising


alarm
 bells.
 Now,
 Jessica,
 you
 get
 to
 do


uh
 something
 that
 is
 usually
 my
 job


here.
 Uh
 try
 to
 make
 municipal
 policy


interesting.
 So,
 who
 is
 so
 exercised


about
 sewers
 in
 Bmpton
 and
 Missaga?


Yeah,
 I
 can't
 do
 what
 you
 do
 as
 you
 do


it.
 That's
 just
 a
 you
 thing,
 but
 it's


great.
 Uh
 what
 I
 can
 say,
 uh
 the
 NDP
 and


other
 groups
 are
 raising
 concerns
 about


this
 part
 of
 this
 bill.
 They
 are
 worried


that
 it
 could
 re
 result
 in
 privatizing


water
 and
 like
 selling
 off
 water


services
 to
 private
 companies,


profitering,
 and
 then
 water
 safety


issues,
 bringing
 up
 Walkerton.
 Um
 the


government
 is
 saying,
 "No,
 absolutely


not.
 No
 way,
 no
 how.
 That
 is
 not
 what


we're
 doing
 and
 it's
 not
 where
 we're


going.
 This
 is
 about
 creating
 a


publiclyowned
 corporate
 model
 for
 water


and
 wastewater
 delivery
 with
 an
 emphasis


on
 publiclyowned,
 not
 a
 private
 company.


>> Some
 people
 may
 not
 actually
 remember


what
 Walker
 uh
 was,
 but
 this
 was
 in
 the


'90s,
 a
 town
 in
 Bruce
 County,
 I
 believe,


and
 uh
 there
 there
 was
 a
 failure
 of
 uh


water
 safety,
 water
 treatment
 there.
 uh


many
 people
 were
 made
 sick
 and
 uh
 it's


it's
 now
 the
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 we
 we


commonly
 use
 it
 as
 a
 shorthand
 for
 uh


the
 perils
 of
 uh
 not
 properly
 regulating


uh
 things
 in
 uh
 the
 public
 health
 uh


sphere.
 So,
 as
 you
 say,
 the
 government


has
 always
 maintained
 that
 this
 is
 not


about
 privatization,
 that
 uh
 the
 the


water
 system
 would
 remain
 publicly


owned.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 concerns
 that
 has


been
 raised
 here,
 one
 of
 the
 the
 the
 odd


little
 specific
 details
 of
 Bill
 60
 is


that
 there
 was
 already
 a
 section
 in


Ontario's
 municipal
 law
 that
 allowed
 the


creation
 of
 these
 kinds
 of
 corporations


to
 to
 handle
 the
 kind
 of
 work
 that
 the


government
 is
 looking
 at
 for
 the
 water


system
 here.
 Whereas
 bill
 60
 requires


that
 this
 new
 water
 company
 that
 will
 be


created
 and
 it
 will
 handle
 the
 water
 and


sewer
 services
 in
 Peele
 region
 uh
 that


will
 be
 incorporated
 under
 the
 business


corporations
 act.
 Now
 a
 company
 can
 be


incorporated
 under
 the
 business


corporations
 act
 and
 still
 be
 publicly


owned.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 prove
 that
 the


ultimate
 goal
 is
 to
 privatize
 anything


but
 that
 is
 like
 the
 kind
 of
 detail
 that


the
 critics
 are
 raising
 here.
 Like
 why


reinvent
 the
 wheel
 if
 your
 aim
 is
 not


ultimately
 uh
 something
 nefarious?
 Uh


again
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 that
 proves
 the


case
 but
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 concerns
 that


is
 being
 raised.
 One
 of the
 things
 that


might
 not
 be
 clear
 to
 to
 listeners
 here


is
 why
 in
 Peele
 region?
 Why
 are
 we
 so


excited
 about
 Peele
 region
 right
 now


specifically,


>> right?
 So,
 let's
 go
 back
 and
 just
 do


very
 brief
 capsule
 history
 here.
 We
 can


remember
 of
 course
 Premier
 Ford
 made
 a


promise
 to
 the
 late
 Hazel
 Mallen
 uh


longtime
 mayor
 of
 uh
 Missaga
 that
 he


would
 dissolve
 Peele
 region.
 Uh
 then
 he


reneged
 on
 that
 promise
 when
 Bonnie


Krombi
 became
 leader
 of
 the
 Liberal


Party.
 Um
 but
 they
 set
 up
 this
 process


of
 really
 rethinking
 all
 of
 the
 the
 the


municipal
 governance
 in
 Peele
 region.


And
 so
 now
 at
 the
 moment
 Peele
 is
 a
 bit


of
 this
 lab
 for
 the
 province
 to


experiment
 on
 because
 of
 that
 kind
 of


odd
 uh
 history.
 Uh
 so
 but
 why
 do
 we
 care


about
 water
 services
 in
 Peele
 region?


And
 the
 answer
 there
 is
 because
 water


infrastructure
 is
 one
 of
 the
 big
 drivers


of
 development
 charges.
 Um
 it
 is
 what
 uh


you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 did
 look
 this
 up
 a
 while


ago
 and
 I
 I
 apologize
 because
 I've


forgotten
 it
 but
 certainly
 I
 think
 at


the
 the
 regional
 level
 sewer
 and
 water


services
 are
 like
 the
 biggest
 part
 of


the
 development
 charge
 uh
 levy
 uh
 for


new
 homes
 in
 Peele
 region.
 So
 that's
 one


side
 of
 it.
 Obviously
 the
 the
 uh
 value


of
 development
 charges
 a
 big
 issue
 that


this
 government
 has
 talked
 about
 uh
 you


know
 trying
 to
 reduce
 development


charges
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 uh
 but
 also


just
 the
 delays
 in
 building
 water


infrastructure
 can
 hold
 up
 the
 uh


construction
 of
 new
 homes.
 So,
 you
 know,


uh
 this
 is
 uh
 the
 government
 trying
 to


address
 uh
 at
 least
 in
 part
 uh
 a
 a


housing
 issue
 and
 potentially
 create
 a


model
 that
 might
 be
 replicated
 elsewhere


in
 the
 province.


>> So,
 basically
 the
 idea
 is
 see
 if
 this


works
 in
 Peele
 region,
 this
 new
 mount


model
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 try,
 see
 if


that
 helps
 us
 get
 the
 water


infrastructure
 faster,
 cheaper.
 I
 don't


know.


>> Yeah.
 Faster,
 cheaper,
 and
 also
 uh
 some


political
 value.
 Probably
 the
 hope
 is
 in


taking
 it
 off
 of
 the
 property
 tax
 base.


Uh
 and
 the
 idea
 here
 is
 that
 a
 a
 a


single
 company
 in
 much
 the
 same
 way
 that


like
 you
 know
 a
 a
 company
 runs
 your


phone
 service,
 your
 internet
 service,
 uh


your
 electricity.
 um
 instead
 of
 having


this
 water
 company
 paid
 for
 out
 of


property
 tax
 uh
 revenues
 that
 it
 would


be
 paid
 for
 purely
 um
 uh
 by
 uh
 user


charges
 and
 some
 of
 the
 costs
 on
 the


side.
 So
 it
 does
 come
 back
 to
 housing


with
 mo
 as
 most
 things
 do
 with
 you
 don't


they?


>> Yeah
 I
 I
 cannot
 escape
 it
 and
 I
 have


stopped
 trying.
 Uh
 but
 yes
 it
 all
 comes


back
 to
 housing
 always.
 And
 with
 that
 on


to
 issue
 three.


>> Within
 the
 text
 of
 bill
 68
 the
 plan
 to


protect
 Ontario
 act
 were
 some
 details


about
 exhibition
 place.
 Essentially
 the


text
 would
 give
 the
 province
 control


over
 the
 grounds.
 This
 has
 raised
 alarm


bells
 with
 the
 opposition
 who
 called
 it


a
 land
 grab.
 The
 government
 has
 since


specified
 that
 the
 legislation
 will
 be


used
 just
 to
 replace
 infrastructure
 like


water
 pipes
 and
 wires.
 What
 else
 should


we
 know
 here,
 Jess?


>> Well,
 this
 story
 reminds
 me
 of
 the
 last


story
 that
 we
 talked
 about.
 Hear
 me
 out.


Every
 so
 often
 we
 get
 these
 issues,


these
 stories
 in
 Ontario
 politics
 where


there's
 a
 massive
 gap
 between
 what
 the


government
 could
 do
 with
 a
 piece
 of


legislation,
 what
 it's
 empowering
 itself


to
 do
 in
 some
 way
 and
 what
 it
 actually


wants
 to
 do
 and
 then
 what
 its
 critics


and
 the
 opposition
 parties
 believe
 its


end
 goal
 is
 actually
 to
 do.
 And
 we're
 as


journalists
 sort
 of
 left
 struggling
 to


be
 like
 where's
 the
 reality?
 What's


what's
 going
 on
 here?
 So
 this
 is
 one
 of


those
 stories.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 we
 get


this
 these
 huge
 gaps
 between
 what
 is


actually
 versions
 of
 what
 might
 be


happening
 when
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of


trust
 between
 the
 government
 and
 the


opposition
 parties
 and
 the
 and
 the


groups
 that
 are
 ringing
 alarm
 bells.
 So,


here
 we
 go.
 Uh,
 an
 NDP
 MPP
 came
 out
 with


a
 fairly
 breathless
 press
 release
 saying


that
 the
 government
 was
 going
 to
 seize


control
 of
 exhibition
 place.
 And
 so


immediately
 that
 led
 to
 people
 being


like
 the
 only
 way
 they're
 doing
 it


that's
 finally
 gonna
 finally
 build
 that


casino
 that
 we've
 always
 known
 that


they've
 been
 planning
 to
 build.


Not
 a
 lot
 of
 evidence
 for
 that
 but
 you


know
 that's


been
 the
 suspicion
 for
 a
 long
 time.


Right.
 So


>> right
 the
 bill
 there
 is
 grounds
 for
 the


MPP
 to
 say
 that
 the
 government
 could
 use


this
 to
 to
 take
 control
 of
 Ontario


place.
 really
 does
 give
 the
 government


more
 power,
 sorry,
 over
 exhibition
 place


uh
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 Ontario
 place


redevelopment.
 It
 it
 allows
 it
 to
 do


more
 than
 it
 has
 said
 it
 wants
 to
 do,


which
 is
 just,
 you
 know,
 make
 things
 go


faster
 when
 they're
 doing
 things
 like


laying
 pipes
 and
 and
 wire
 and
 expediting


development.
 So,
 here
 we
 are
 again,
 the


government
 saying,
 "We
 just
 want
 it
 for


this."
 the
 bill
 says
 they
 could
 do
 much


more
 and
 there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 trust
 in


the
 government
 for
 only
 doing
 what
 they


say
 they
 want
 to
 do
 with
 this


legislation
 that
 they're
 doing.


>> And
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 know
 the
 the
 NDP


uh
 made
 their
 claims
 and
 then
 the


government
 didn't
 exactly
 clarify
 things


uh
 promptly
 or
 or
 quickly
 as
 fast
 as


they
 could
 have,
 did
 they?


>> Yeah.
 No,
 it
 was
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 mess.
 We


asked
 questions
 like,
 "Why
 do
 you
 need


this?"
 And
 it
 was
 like,
 "Hold
 on,
 we'll


get
 back
 to
 you
 vague
 statement
 that


didn't
 actually
 answer
 any
 of
 those


questions."
 And
 when
 that
 happens,
 it


doesn't
 breed
 a
 lot
 of
 trust.
 And
 they


also
 hadn't
 looped
 in
 the
 city,
 which


was
 caught
 off
 guard.
 Uh
 and
 the
 city's


obviously
 a
 huge
 partner
 in
 all
 things


exhibition
 place.
 So
 no,
 that
 didn't


help
 with
 this
 keeping
 down
 the
 the
 fear


and
 confusion.


>> Now,
 uh
 you
 mentioned
 this
 is
 all


happening
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 Ontario


Place
 redevelopment.
 Uh
 Charlie


Pinkerton
 at
 the
 Trillium
 reported
 last


week
 that
 that
 redevelopment,
 the


Ontario
 Place
 redevelopment,
 could


actually
 take
 substantially
 longer
 than


the
 government
 has
 been
 claiming.


>> Yeah,
 he
 he
 did
 some
 uh
 FOI
 requests
 and


got
 some
 briefing
 documents
 that
 said


the
 construction
 period
 for
 the
 Thurma


Spa
 should
 be
 24
 months
 with
 potential


extensions
 up
 to
 9
 years,
 which
 is
 a
 lot


longer.
 Does
 that
 mean
 it's
 going
 to


take
 more
 time,
 11,
 nine
 years
 or


something?
 Not
 necessarily.
 But
 the


government
 is
 planning
 for
 what
 would


happen
 if
 it
 does
 take
 that
 long
 and
 it


would
 cost
 the
 some
 money
 is
 the
 upshot


of
 that.


>> Right.
 Uh
 one
 additional
 point
 of


context
 that
 I
 I
 want
 to
 throw
 in
 here.


You
 mentioned
 that
 like
 they
 didn't
 loop


in
 the
 city
 and
 that's
 kind
 of
 a
 big


deal
 because
 the
 city
 of
 Toronto
 owns


Exhibition
 Place
 when
 the
 province
 shut


down
 Ontario
 Place
 in
 gosh
 what
 was
 that


2011
 2012.
 You
 know
 the
 the
 decision
 was


ultimately
 very
 simple
 because
 the


province
 was
 losing
 money
 on
 Ontario


Place.
 Nobody
 really
 believed,
 at least


in
 government,
 uh,
 in
 the
 then
 McGinty


government,
 uh,
 nobody
 believed
 that


there
 was
 a
 path
 back
 to
 profitability


for
 a
 a
 government-run
 amusement
 park.


Um,
 and
 all
 of
 the
 twists
 and
 turns
 in


in
 the
 Ontario
 Place
 story
 since
 then,
 I


would
 argue,
 you
 know,
 were
 largely


because
 the
 wind
 government
 wanted
 to


try
 and
 figure
 out
 some
 way
 to
 make


money
 off
 of
 this
 land,
 you
 know,


waterfront
 land
 in
 downtown
 Toronto.
 Uh


it
 it
 you
 know
 certainly
 I
 I
 know
 the


premier
 was
 getting
 advice
 from
 the
 the


the
 finance
 ministry
 about
 how
 to
 you


know
 turn
 that
 into
 uh
 an
 asset
 that


would
 produce
 money
 for
 the
 people
 of


Ontario.
 Of
 course
 this
 is
 in
 the


context
 of
 big
 deficits
 uh
 during
 the


win
 years.
 Um,
 but
 you
 know,
 she
 was
 she


was
 getting
 all
 sorts
 of
 cross
 pressure,


right?
 On
 the
 one
 hand,
 you
 want
 to
 uh


redevelop
 Ontario
 Place
 in
 in
 a
 way
 that


makes
 money,
 but
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 uh


downtown
 uh
 Toronto
 residents
 who
 vote


liberal
 did
 not
 want
 a
 casino.
 They
 did


not
 want
 condos.
 Um
 and
 once
 you
 rule


out
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 either
 residential
 or


commercial
 uses
 for
 that
 space,
 you
 just


there's
 not
 a
 lot
 left
 to
 do.


>> And
 so
 not
 a
 lot
 happened
 at
 Ontario


Place.
 And
 then
 Doug
 Ford
 wins
 in
 2018


and
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 things
 start


happening.
 Anyway,
 that
 is
 all
 context


to
 say
 this
 is
 not
 what
 is
 happening
 at


Exhibition
 Place.
 The
 city
 of
 Toronto


owns
 Exhibition
 Place
 and
 I
 don't
 know


if
 it
 makes
 money
 off
 of
 Exhibition


Place
 every
 single
 year,
 but
 in
 general


it's
 it
 is
 a
 a
 asset
 that
 pays
 money


into
 the
 city.
 Uh
 the
 convention
 center


is
 very
 busy.
 It's
 I
 think
 the
 one
 of


the
 largest,
 if
 not
 the
 largest


convention
 center
 in
 Canada.
 It
 is
 just


a
 totally
 different
 story
 from
 Ontario


Place.
 That
 is
 a
 a
 an
 asset
 that
 the


city
 very
 much
 knows
 what
 it
 wants
 to
 do


with,
 wants
 to
 hang
 on
 to.
 And
 so
 when


you
 start
 ringing
 alarm
 bells
 about
 uh


the
 the
 potential
 provincial
 takeover
 of


Exhibition
 Place,
 the
 city
 of
 Toronto,


not
 unreasonably,
 freaks
 right
 out.


>> All right,
 with
 that,
 let's
 go
 to
 the


mailbag.


If
 you've
 got
 a
 burning
 question
 or


insightful
 comment,
 you
 can
 always
 send


it
 along
 to
 us
 at
 onp
 politicsvo.org.


And
 uh
 this
 week,
 Jessica,
 you
 get
 to


read
 uh
 the
 letter
 uh
 uh
 guests


privilege.
 What
 do
 we
 have?


>> Here's
 an
 email
 from
 listener
 Scott
 Juru


in
 Belleville
 who
 writes
 to
 us
 about
 a


Trillium
 article.
 How
 convenient
 that


I'm
 here.
 Hello.
 Big
 fan
 of
 the
 show.


Here
 is
 an
 interesting
 article
 from
 the


Trillium
 on
 municipalities
 using
 Ford/PC


lobbyists
 to
 get
 things
 done
 for
 their


municipality
 in
 2024.
 This
 seems
 to
 be


rather
 consistent
 methods/behavior
 with


the
 skills
 development
 fund
 as
 well
 as


other
 provincial
 programs.
 My
 question


is,
 is
 this
 the
 way
 things
 have
 always


worked
 in
 Ontario
 that
 using
 lobbyists


formerly
 of
 the
 government
 or
 friends
 of


MPP/theshadow
 Premier
 Saj
 Kandra's


friends
 is
 the
 best
 way
 to
 get
 things


done.
 Could
 you
 explain
 the
 issue
 better


than
 I
 and
 dig
 deep
 into
 Steve's


memories
 to
 see
 if
 this
 style
 of


lobbying
 is
 the
 norm
 for
 past


governments
 or
 is
 this
 mostly


unprecedented
 from
 Scott
 Jaru
 in


Belleville,
 Ontario?


>> So,
 we
 can't
 dig
 into
 Steve's
 uh


memories
 today,
 but
 we
 can
 dig
 into
 our


own.
 But
 before
 we
 do
 that,
 we
 can
 uh


actually
 dig
 into
 the
 Trillium's


reporting
 here.
 Uh
 again,
 we're
 going
 to


reference
 uh
 superstar
 Charlie


Pinkerton.
 This
 is
 a
 story
 of
 his
 from


about
 a
 year
 ago.
 Um,
 Jess,
 can
 you
 take


us
 through
 the
 story?


>> Yeah,
 we
 need
 a
 third
 chair
 here
 for
 uh


the
 story
 was
 about
 Brighton,
 Ontario.


The
 city
 needed
 infrastructure
 funding


to
 fix
 issues
 with
 its
 water
 systems.


Uh,
 and
 it
 decided
 to
 hire
 a
 lobbying


firm,
 Atlas
 Strategic
 Adviserss.
 Uh,


that's
 a
 firm
 run
 by
 Amin
 Massudi,
 who


was
 once
 Doug
 Ford's
 right-hand
 man.
 Uh,


so
 what
 they
 did,
 these
 counselors,
 is


they
 talked
 about
 this
 openly
 in
 council


as
 if
 no
 one
 was
 listening.
 Um,
 but


someone
 was,
 and
 it
 actually
 wasn't


Charlie.
 He
 doesn't
 just
 listen
 in
 to


random
 city
 council
 meetings.


>> Call
 in
 to
 random
 municipal
 councils


around
 Ontario.


>> No,
 but
 there


>> we
 should
 keep
 that
 thread
 out
 there.


There
 was
 uh
 a
 local
 person
 who
 had
 like


a
 newsletter
 and
 had
 some
 involvement
 in


politics
 there
 and
 she
 brought
 their
 the


comments
 to
 light
 which
 was
 stuff
 that


the
 the
 Ontario
 government
 shed
 in
 light


saying
 that
 the
 town
 was
 hiring
 a


lobbyist
 to
 work
 the
 backroom
 not


somebody
 for
 their
 technical
 expertise


is
 no
 we
 have
 that
 this
 is
 a
 backroom


guy
 because
 this
 is
 how
 stuff
 gets
 done


in
 Ontario.
 That's
 what
 these
 counselors


were
 saying.
 So
 big
 controversy
 at


Queens
 Park.
 Uh
 you
 know
 the
 idea
 that


you
 need
 to
 hire
 a
 firm
 close
 to
 premier


to
 get
 anything
 done
 was
 something
 the


opposition
 latched
 on
 to
 and
 the


government
 vehemently
 rejected.
 Uh


ultimately
 the
 town
 and
 Atlas
 stopped


working
 together.
 Uh
 the
 town
 didn't
 get


the
 funding
 it
 wanted
 in
 that
 round.
 But


the
 idea
 of
 whether
 this
 is
 new
 that
 the


reader
 that
 the
 letter
 writer
 asked


about.
 Um
 it's
 not
 new
 for
 a
 government


to
 have
 an
 ethics
 scandal.


>> Um
 the
 the
 idea
 that
 to
 get
 something


done
 in
 Ontario,
 you
 need
 a


well-connected
 person
 or
 to
 be
 a


well-connected
 person
 is
 the
 same
 kind


of
 idea
 that
 the
 government's
 getting
 in


trouble
 for
 over
 the
 skills
 development


fund.
 And
 it's
 sort
 of
 been
 an
 issue
 for


this
 government
 since
 its
 early
 days


with
 the
 whole
 Dean
 French
 patronage.


>> Yes.
 Oh
 gosh.


>> But
 it's
 all


>> every
 I
 forget
 about
 Dean
 French
 and


then
 comes
 back
 up
 again.


>> Yeah.


Um
 but
 no,
 in
 general,
 this
 is
 not
 new


for
 any
 government
 ever.
 Like
 I
 came
 to


Queens
 Park
 when
 it
 was
 the
 Liberal


government
 under
 fire
 for
 what
 they


called
 the
 cash
 for
 access
 scandal
 of


the
 day.
 This
 was
 big
 dinners
 with


corporate
 donors
 getting
 facetime
 with


ministers
 and
 the
 liberals
 dominating


fundraising
 because
 of
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Ministers
 being
 given
 like


explicit
 fundraising
 targets
 uh
 and
 and


even
 you
 know
 complaining
 to
 the
 press


anonymously
 about
 how
 ownorous
 their


fundraising
 uh
 targets
 were
 that
 kind
 of


thing.
 Um,
 no,
 as
 you
 say,
 like,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 could,
 you
 know,
 even
 if
 you


want
 to
 just
 talk
 narrowly
 about


lobbying.
 I
 remember
 one
 of
 the
 ones


that
 sticks
 in
 my
 mind
 was,
 um,
 a
 former


aid
 for
 a
 Liberal
 Minister
 of


Transportation
 went
 to
 go
 work
 for
 Tesla


and
 some
 interval
 later,
 the
 government


revised
 its
 EV
 subsidies
 uh,
 in
 a
 way


that
 benefited
 Tesla,
 right?
 um
 these


things
 are
 not
 uh
 unheard
 of,
 not
 novel.


But


I
 guess
 I
 would
 say
 two
 things.
 one,
 my


sense
 is
 that
 um


it
 it
 at
 least
 was
 not
 quite
 so
 blatant


and
 it
 it
 had
 not
 percolated
 all
 the
 way


to
 municipalities
 where
 that
 you
 know
 I


I
 don't
 remember
 any
 stories
 um
 from
 the


from
 the
 wind
 era
 for
 example
 where


municipalities
 were
 saying
 uh
 in
 open


meetings
 at
 council
 certainly
 uh
 that


you
 know
 the
 only
 way
 to
 to
 you
 know
 do


business
 with
 the
 government
 was
 to
 uh


hire
 a
 lobbyist.
 Um
 and
 the
 other
 thing


that
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more


interesting
 looking
 forward
 uh
 both
 for


uh
 the
 PC
 party
 and
 and
 for


conservatives
 frankly
 around
 the
 country


is


the
 way
 that
 these
 things
 are
 playing


out
 with
 the
 government.
 the
 the
 the


proximity
 to
 lobbyists
 um
 is
 not
 just
 a


uh
 uh
 a
 question
 of
 you
 know
 good
 public


government
 and
 and
 and
 fairness
 and


transparency
 and
 all
 uh
 those
 things


which
 obviously
 we
 as
 journalists
 will


continue
 to
 to
 keep
 an
 eye
 on
 but
 it
 is


also
 an
 issue
 within
 the
 PC
 party
 right


there
 are
 people
 within
 Doug
 Ford's


party
 who
 are
 very
 put
 off
 by
 uh
 this


whole
 element
 of
 government
 um
 and
 uh


you
 know
 some
 of
 this
 is
 personalities


right
 you
 know
 there
 are
 people
 who


don't
 like
 some
 of
 the
 the
 people
 who


are
 closest
 to
 the
 premier
 that
 kind
 of


thing
 and
 then
 you
 know
 there's
 always


that
 kind
 of
 grumbling
 um
 but
 there
 are


people
 who
 sort
 of
 genuinely
 feel
 like


you
 know
 uh
 policym
 is
 being
 dis


distorted
 by
 the
 the
 the
 proximity
 of
 uh


the
 premier
 to
 these
 lobbyists
 and
 you


know
 I
 think
 if
 we
 had
 Matt
 spoke
 on
 the


podcast
 a
 while
 back
 uh
 you
 know
 he's
 I


would
 call
 him
 like
 a
 Tory
 dissident
 uh


trying
 to
 you
 know
 um
 move
 the
 party
 in


a
 different
 direction.
 Uh
 and
 and
 yeah,


like
 the
 the
 relationship
 between
 the


government
 and
 lobbyists
 is
 absolutely


all
 in
 this
 mix
 of
 this
 question
 of
 what


you
 know,
 what
 kind
 of
 conservatives
 do


conservatives
 want
 their
 party
 to
 be
 and


there
 are
 some
 who
 are
 looking
 at
 the


results
 of
 Doug
 Ford
 and
 and
 not
 liking


what
 they're
 seeing.


>> Yeah.
 The
 Project
 Ontario
 people
 are
 on


the
 slightly
 they
 would
 describe


themselves
 as
 I
 think
 more
 conservative


than
 the
 PC
 government.
 Yeah.
 And


they're
 very
 critical
 of
 their
 ethics
 as


critical
 as
 you
 might
 find
 like
 comments


from
 the
 NDP
 which
 is
 always
 interesting


to
 see.


>> Yes.


>> All
 right.
 Uh
 and
 of
 course
 if
 people
 do


want
 to
 read
 uh
 that
 story
 from
 Charlie


uh
 back
 uh
 from
 last
 year
 you
 said
 uh
 we


are
 going
 to
 put
 a
 link
 in
 the
