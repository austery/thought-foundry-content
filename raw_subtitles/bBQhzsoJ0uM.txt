Startups
 are
 hiring
 far
 fewer
 people


than
 they
 used
 to.
 In
 January
 of
 2022,


companies
 on
 Carta
 hired
 73,000
 people.


In
 January
 2023,
 they
 hired
 40,000.
 In


January
 2024,
 they
 hired
 32,000.
 And
 in


January
 2025,
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


like
 20,000
 or
 so.
 I
 am
 not
 one
 of
 those


people
 that
 says
 AI
 is
 not
 going
 to
 take


jobs.
 I
 think
 it
 kind
 of
 already
 is.
 How


are
 changes
 at
 venture
 capital
 impacting


startups
 and
 scaleups?
 And
 what
 does


this
 mean
 for
 software
 engineers?
 Peter


Walker
 is
 the
 head
 of
 insights
 at
 Carter


and
 Carter
 is
 used
 by
 more
 than
 50%
 of


all
 US
 startups
 to
 record
 funding
 and


equity
 related
 data.
 Peter
 collected


over
 a
 dozen
 interesting
 data
 points
 and


charts
 about
 what
 is
 changing
 with
 tech


startups.
 Today
 we
 talk
 about
 how
 the


number
 of
 startups
 getting
 funding
 has


been
 steadily
 dropping
 even
 though
 the


amount
 of
 VC
 invested
 has
 remained


constant.
 Data
 showing
 the
 impact
 of
 AI


and
 how
 it
 might
 result
 in
 smaller
 teams


and
 more
 solo
 founders.
 what
 to
 look
 for


before
 joining
 a
 VC
 funded
 company
 and


what
 can
 help
 you
 thrive
 at
 a
 startup.


If
 you
 work
 at
 a
 VC
 funded
 company,
 plan


to
 join
 one,
 would
 want
 to
 become
 an


adviser
 to
 one
 or
 are
 interested
 in


venture
 capital
 dynamics,
 this
 episode


is
 for
 you.

 So,
 Peter,


welcome
 to
 the
 podcast.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.
 This
 is


awesome.


>> It's
 it's
 it's
 really
 good
 for
 you
 to
 be


here.
 Now
 let's
 start
 with
 the
 venture


capital
 ecosystem,
 how
 healthy
 it
 is
 and


and
 how
 can
 we
 think
 of
 of
 health
 and
 as


we
 go
 let's
 let's
 just
 also
 talk
 through


about
 some
 of
 the
 I
 guess
 basic
 terms


that
 you
 know
 like
 we
 commonly
 use


>> when
 we're
 talking
 about
 venture
 capital


in
 the
 US
 that
 is
 a
 venture
 is
 a
 subset


of
 private
 equity.
 It's
 the
 standard


things
 that
 people
 are
 familiar
 with
 of


all
 these
 wonderful
 investors
 going


around
 finding
 diamonds
 in
 the
 rough


young
 companies
 that
 need
 capital.


Hopefully
 those
 companies
 then
 shoot
 up


in
 valuation
 and
 they
 become
 the
 public


companies
 that
 we
 love
 today.
 So
 you


know
 all
 of
 I
 think
 all
 of
 the
 MAG
 7
 at


one
 point
 or
 another
 took
 venture


capital


>> and
 and and
 the
 Mac
 7
 is
 a
 seven
 guess


tech
 companies
 right?
 Is
 it
 Microsoft,


Apple,


>> Apple,
 Google,


Nvidia?
 I
 think
 Mango
 is
 the
 new
 one


where
 you
 talk
 that
 includes
 Nvidia
 as


it
 the
 the
 acronym
 always
 keeps


changing.


>> Yeah.
 It
 used
 to
 be
 fang
 even
 though


it's
 now
 meta
 not
 Facebook
 but
 yeah.


Exactly.
 Yeah,
 they're
 they're
 screwing


with
 the
 names
 a
 little
 bit,
 so
 we
 got


to
 keep
 changing
 the
 acronym.
 But
 those


big
 uh
 seven
 tech
 companies
 are
 good


examples
 of
 what
 venture
 capital
 is


trying
 to
 do.
 They're
 trying
 to
 find


really
 really
 young
 companies,
 give
 them


a
 slug
 of
 capital,
 and
 then
 watch
 their


valuations
 expand
 dramatically
 over


time.
 So
 VC,
 for
 a
 while,
 it
 kind
 of


felt
 like
 venture
 capital
 was
 the
 quote


unquote
 default
 way
 to
 build
 a
 startup.


That's
 never
 actually
 been
 true.
 There's


always
 been
 many,
 many
 more
 companies


that
 don't
 take
 VC
 versus
 the
 ones
 that


do.
 It's
 just
 a
 lot
 easier
 to
 talk
 about


the
 ones
 that
 do
 take
 VC
 because
 as
 you


raise
 money,
 there
 are
 sort
 of


checkpoints
 along
 the
 way.
 So,
 you
 get


seed
 rounds
 and
 series
 A
 rounds
 and


series
 B
 rounds.
 Whereas,
 if
 you
 don't


take
 any
 VC,
 nobody
 really
 knows
 where


you
 are
 as
 a
 business.
 And
 so,
 it's
 a


lot
 easier
 to
 talk
 about
 the


venturebacked
 businesses
 than
 it
 is


about
 the
 non-venturebacked
 ones.


>> And
 as
 someone
 who
 has
 been
 embedded
 in


in
 the
 VC
 world,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 the


main
 differences
 are?
 just
 thinking


about
 as
 a
 software
 engineer
 or
 as
 an


employee
 thinking
 about
 joining
 a
 VC


funded
 company
 versus
 a
 nonVC
 funded
 one


what
 might
 be
 something
 I
 know
 it's
 hard


to
 generalize
 but
 but
 still
 let's
 let's


try
 right
 like
 what
 what
 might
 be


differences
 in
 terms
 of
 culture
 pace


compensation
 those
 kind
 of
 things


>> I'd
 say
 it
 actually
 boils
 down
 to
 one


key
 difference
 which
 is
 venture
 is
 in


the
 business
 of
 funding
 growth
 and
 not


just
 regular
 growth
 but
 expansive
 growth


so
 any
 sort
 of
 VC
 backed
 business
 will


by
 definition
 be
 pushed
 by
 their


investors
 and
 should
 have
 the
 outlook


that
 we
 are
 going
 to
 grow
 super
 fast.
 So


for
 instance,
 the
 recent
 examples
 of
 the


AI
 companies
 like
 cursor
 and
 others
 who


are
 just
 ballooning
 up
 through
 different


ARR
 metrics
 faster
 than
 basically
 any


companies
 we've
 ever
 seen,
 those
 are


perfect
 candidates
 for
 venture
 capital.


If
 instead
 you
 have
 a
 business
 that's


growing
 20%
 a
 year,
 they're
 making


money,
 it's
 a
 great
 business,
 but
 that


isn't
 a
 candidate
 for
 VC
 because
 it


doesn't
 project
 to
 have
 the
 growth
 rates


necessary
 to
 make
 these
 bets
 worthwhile


for
 the
 investors.
 And
 that
 obviously


has
 downstream
 impacts
 to
 compensation


that
 has
 downstream
 impacts
 to
 what
 the


company
 is
 focused
 on.
 You
 know,
 the


pace
 of
 the
 actual
 work,
 the


expectations
 both
 from
 the
 board
 and


from
 the
 founders.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


changes
 that
 happen
 when
 you're
 beholden


to
 investor
 expectations
 versus
 you
 are


just
 building
 for
 yourselves
 and
 for


your
 customers.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 you
 know
 like
 having


worked
 at
 Uber
 at
 its
 craziest
 growth


time
 I
 was
 there
 from
 2016
 to
 2020
 and
 I


worked
 at
 companies
 that
 might
 have
 had


either
 venture
 funding
 or
 or
 or
 some
 of


them
 just
 didn't
 like
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 found
 is
 at at
 least
 at
 a


very
 high
 growth
 startup
 like
 a
 VCR
 that


is
 actually
 growing
 it
 felt
 kind
 of
 very


exciting
 slashstressful
 and
 also
 a
 bit


irrational
 and
 by
 this
 like
 at
 Uber
 like


I
 remember
 we
 had
 an
 outage
 uh
 in
 India


some
 of
 our
 our
 payments
 went
 down
 and


we
 did
 a
 postmortem
 of
 like
 what
 what


was
 the
 damage
 right
 like
 how
 much
 money


did
 we
 lose
 and
 the
 engineer
 said
 like


actually
 we
 saved
 the
 business
 a
 bunch


of
 money
 I'm
 like
 what
 do
 you
 mean
 he's


like
 well
 on
 every
 ride
 we
 lose
 an


average
 of
 $2
 in
 India
 because
 we're
 in


growth
 phase
 therefore
 you
 know
 we
 miss


50,000
 rides
 we
 save
 like
 $100,000
 and
 I


was
 like
 hold
 on
 like
 well
 actually
 that


that's
 kind
 of
 true
 true
 and
 and
 this


thing
 would
 have
 never
 happened
 at


another
 type
 of
 company
 and
 and
 you
 know


like
 I
 I
 I
 I
 think
 you're
 right
 like
 it


all
 goes
 back
 to
 to
 growth
 and
 and
 also


I
 feel
 it's
 a
 mindset
 because
 sometimes


growth
 does
 mean
 irrational
 things.
 For


example,
 we
 like
 grew
 the
 business


knowing
 we're
 losing
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 like


it
 felt
 painfully
 much
 but
 in
 the
 end
 I


look
 at
 where
 Uber
 ended
 up
 and
 yeah
 it


it
 worked
 out
 for
 them
 for
 for
 that


specific
 category.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 a
 great
 point
 that


there's
 this
 inherent
 trade-off
 often


times
 although
 AI
 is
 maybe
 starting
 to


challenge
 this
 uh
 between
 profitability


and
 growth.
 So
 if
 you
 are
 pouring
 every


single
 dollar
 into
 growth,
 often
 times


you're
 doing
 so
 in
 on
 a
 unit
 economics


basis
 unprofitable
 ways.
 Whereas
 a


normal
 business
 uh
 if
 you
 think
 of
 you


know
 a
 normal
 retailer
 or
 a
 restaurant


or
 whatever
 they
 would
 never
 consider,


oh
 we
 need
 to
 grow
 so
 fast
 that
 we
 are


actually
 losing
 money
 on
 every
 time


someone
 comes
 in
 and
 orders
 dinner.
 That


doesn't
 make
 any
 sense.
 But
 the
 VC
 model


is
 about
 using
 capital
 at
 the
 beginning,


funding
 incredibly
 high
 growth
 rates
 and


then
 reaping
 the
 rewards
 of
 those
 growth


rates
 because
 the
 company
 has
 gotten
 so


large
 that
 they
 dictate
 what's
 going
 on


in
 the
 market.
 So
 I
 think
 actually
 Uber


is
 perhaps
 the
 example
 of
 when
 venture


capital
 works
 well
 because
 now
 Uber
 is
 a


very
 profitable
 company
 growing
 still


growing
 very
 very
 quickly.
 There
 are
 a


lot
 of
 examples
 and
 this
 is
 where
 people


kind
 of
 get
 mad
 at
 VCs
 where
 a
 company


will
 take
 venture
 capital
 and
 then
 it'll


turn
 out
 that
 there
 just
 wasn't
 the


growth
 rate
 there.
 It
 wasn't
 possible
 to


grow
 as
 fast
 as
 the
 VCs
 needed.
 So
 the


investors
 go
 eh
 whatever
 we're
 going
 to


go
 to
 our
 next
 bet
 and
 the
 founders
 and


employees
 are
 left
 to
 say
 well
 we
 have


to
 build
 a
 company
 out
 of
 this
 thing


that
 is
 no
 longer
 you
 know
 the
 favored


child
 of
 these
 investors.
 And
 so
 there's


sometimes
 are
 those
 sort
 of
 misaligned


incentives
 between
 investor
 and
 founder.


>> This
 episode
 is
 brought
 to
 you
 by
 work


OS.
 If
 you're
 building
 a
 SAS
 app,
 at


some
 point
 your
 customers
 will
 start


asking
 for
 enterprise
 features
 like
 SL


authentication,
 skin
 provisioning,
 and


fine
 grain
 authorization.
 That's
 where


work
 OS
 comes
 in,
 making
 it
 fast
 and


painless
 to
 add
 enterprise
 features
 to


your
 app.
 Their
 APIs
 are
 easy
 to


understand,
 and
 you
 can
 ship
 quickly
 and


get
 back
 to
 building
 other
 features.


Work
 OS
 also
 provides
 a
 free
 user


management
 solution
 called
 OKit
 for
 up


to
 1
 million
 monthly
 active
 users.
 It's


a
 drop
 in
 replacement
 for
 Ozero
 and


comes
 standard
 with
 useful
 features
 like


domain
 verification,
 rolebased
 access


control,
 bot
 protection,
 and
 MFA.
 It's


powered
 by
 Radics
 components
 which
 means


zero
 compromises
 in
 design.
 You
 get


limitless
 customizations
 as
 well
 as


modular
 templates
 designed
 for
 quick


integrations.
 Today,
 hundreds
 of
 fast


growing
 startups
 are
 powered
 by
 work
 OS,


including
 ones
 you
 probably
 know
 like


Cursor,
 Verscell,
 and
 Perplexity.

If
 you
 want
 to
 build
 a
 great
 product,


you
 have
 to
 ship
 quickly.
 But
 how
 do
 you


know
 what
 works?
 More
 importantly,
 how


do
 you
 avoid
 shipping
 things
 that
 don't


work?
 The
 answer,
 Statig.
 Static
 is
 a


unified
 platform
 for
 flags,
 analytics,


experiments,
 and
 more.
 Combining
 five


plus
 products
 into
 a
 single
 platform


with
 a
 unified
 set
 of
 data.
 Here's
 how


it
 works.
 First,
 static
 helps
 you
 ship
 a


feature
 with
 a
 feature
 flag
 or
 config.


Then,
 it
 measures
 how
 it's
 working
 from


alerts
 and
 errors
 to
 replays
 of
 people


using
 that
 feature
 to
 measurement
 of


topline
 impact.
 Then
 you
 get
 your


analytics,
 user
 account
 metrics,
 and


dashboards
 to
 track
 your
 progress
 over


time,
 all
 linked
 to
 the
 stuff
 you
 ship.


Even
 better,
 Static
 is
 incredibly


affordable
 with
 the
 super
 generous
 free


tier,
 a
 starter
 program
 with
 $50,000
 of


free
 credits
 and
 custom
 plans
 to
 help


you
 consolidate
 your
 existing
 spend
 on


flags,
 analytics,
 or
 AB
 testing
 tools.

Happy
 building.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 we
 we've


seen
 examples
 and
 yeah,
 it
 can
 be
 sad


and
 and
 also
 like
 a
 bit
 tragic
 as
 as
 an


employee,
 but
 I
 guess
 it's
 I
 think
 it's


just
 healthy
 to
 know,
 you
 know,
 what
 to


expect
 uh
 because
 again,
 it's
 I
 I
 feel


it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 it's
 either
 go
 to


the
 moon
 or
 or
 crash
 back
 on
 on on


ground.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 on


venture
 capital
 uh
 going
 forward
 with
 VC


funded
 companies.
 You
 know,
 this
 is
 a
 a


sector
 that
 that's
 very
 interesting,


exciting,
 and
 I'm
 looking
 forward
 to


learning
 more
 on
 what
 we
 can
 learn
 from


data.
 So
 we
 have
 this
 some
 interesting


data
 that
 you
 previously
 shared
 that


we're
 going
 to
 get
 into.
 The
 first
 one


is
 how
 healthy
 is
 venture
 capital.
 What


what
 do
 we
 see
 here
 on
 this
 on
 this


interesting
 chart?


>> So
 I
 think
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 the
 health


of
 VC
 backed
 startups
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 we


by
 health
 we
 kind
 of
 default
 to
 how
 much


money
 is
 being
 raised
 by
 these
 startups.


And
 if
 you
 just
 go
 on
 that
 basis,
 VC


looks
 very
 robust
 and
 healthy.
 But
 those


are
 typically
 very
 very
 power
 law


outcomes.
 Meaning
 there's
 a
 tiny
 cohort


of
 companies
 that
 actually
 end
 up


raising
 a
 ton
 of
 the
 money.
 And
 right


now
 that's
 you
 know
 we
 all
 can
 list
 them


open
 AAI,
 XAI,
 etc.


>> who
 are
 raising
 billions
 and
 billions


and
 billions
 of
 dollars.
 If
 you
 instead


look
 at
 just
 the
 number
 of
 rounds
 raised


instead
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 capital
 in
 each


of
 those
 rounds,
 uh
 the
 picture
 looks
 a


little
 bit
 less
 healthy.
 You
 know,
 early


stage
 startups,
 so
 seed
 and
 series
 A


startups,
 we
 saw
 an
 average
 of
 7.4


rounds
 per
 day
 on
 Carta
 so
 far
 in
 2025.


That
 is
 about
 half
 of
 where
 we
 were


thinking
 at
 in
 2021,
 and
 it's
 gone
 down


every
 single
 year
 since
 2021.
 So,
 so


this
 means
 just
 fewer
 companies
 are
 are


raising.
 It
 might
 be
 bigger
 rounds
 or
 or


whatever,
 but
 like
 you
 know
 that
 that


that
 sounds
 bad,
 right?


>> Exactly.
 Fewer
 companies
 are
 raising.


Now,
 why
 are
 fewer
 companies
 raising?


There's
 a
 ton
 of
 reasons
 behind
 this.
 I


think
 two
 fundamental
 ones.
 First,
 um,


everyone,
 and
 by
 everyone,
 I
 mean
 all


the
 VCs
 are
 looking
 around
 and
 going,


"Wow,
 the
 world
 has
 changed.
 I
 used
 to


think
 that
 a
 company
 growing
 100%
 a
 year


was
 a
 great
 company.
 Now
 it
 maybe
 I'm


looking
 for
 200%
 growth
 a
 year
 or
 300%


growth
 per
 year
 when
 I
 used
 to
 look
 for


100%.
 Because
 they
 have
 these
 examples


of
 cursor
 and
 other
 places
 where
 these


companies
 are
 blowing
 past
 the
 old


benchmarks.
 So
 that's
 number
 one
 is
 like


all
 the
 speed
 the
 speed
 just
 got
 much


much
 faster
 and
 companies
 are
 having
 to


prove
 more
 and
 more.
 The
 second
 reason


and
 maybe
 this
 is
 a
 good
 thing
 is
 there


are
 a
 cohort
 of
 companies
 who
 are


looking
 around
 and
 saying
 maybe
 we
 don't


need
 to
 raise
 venture
 capital.
 Maybe
 we


are
 going
 to
 build
 this
 business
 and
 try


to
 get
 to
 profitability
 and
 then
 have
 a


lot
 of
 options.
 Maybe
 we
 take
 outside


capital,
 maybe
 we
 continue
 to
 bootstrap,


whatever
 it
 is,
 but
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to


make
 VC
 the
 default
 way
 we
 build.
 And


that
 I
 think
 has
 definitely
 especially


in
 Silicon
 Valley
 that
 did
 not
 used
 to


be
 a
 very
 common
 thing
 and
 now
 it's


getting
 more
 and
 more
 talked
 about
 in


the
 ecosystem.


>> I
 mean
 this
 last
 one
 I
 think
 is
 kind
 of


a
 good
 thing
 right
 because
 I
 I
 feel


people
 forget
 that
 as
 long
 as
 you
 keep


raising
 VCU
 are
 dependent
 on
 next


funding
 and
 also
 investors
 start
 to
 have


a
 lot
 more
 say.
 I
 think
 we
 saw
 at
 Uber


again
 an
 extreme
 example
 of
 when


investors
 step
 in
 and
 they
 they
 want
 to


fire
 the
 CEO
 or
 they're
 arguing
 about
 it


and
 then
 it
 happens
 you
 know
 like
 uh
 if


the
 more
 you
 stay
 in
 charge
 like
 from
 a


founder
 perspective
 and
 from
 an
 employee


perspective
 that
 sounds
 pretty
 pretty


nice
 if
 the
 company
 is
 in
 charge
 you


know
 they
 can
 decide
 what
 we're
 going to


do
 and
 not
 not
 have
 to
 listen
 to


external
 forces
 but
 yeah


>> exact
 exactly
 right
 yeah
 most
 companies


let's
 be
 honest
 most
 companies
 that
 are


founded
 even
 tech
 companies
 probably


shouldn't
 take
 VC
 It's
 a
 specific
 kind


of
 company
 that
 can
 put
 that
 capital
 to


good
 work
 and
 that's
 why
 so
 many
 people


pitch
 VCs
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 get
 nos.


>> What
 can
 we
 talk
 about
 hiring?


>> If
 you're
 talking
 about
 how
 AI
 has


impacted
 startups,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the


single
 biggest
 trend
 from
 our
 data.
 And


the
 trend
 is
 this.
 Startups
 are
 hiring


far
 fewer
 people
 than
 they
 used
 to.
 So


if
 we
 just
 look
 at
 this
 uh
 showing
 a


chart
 here
 with
 uh
 hires
 and
 departures,


but
 if
 you
 just
 focus
 on
 the
 black
 line


that
 is
 hires,
 in
 January
 of
 2022,


companies
 on
 Carta
 hired
 73,000
 people


in
 a
 single
 month.
 That's
 a
 very
 high


number.
 In
 January
 2023,
 they
 hired


40,000.
 In
 January
 2024,
 they
 hired


32,000.
 And
 in
 January
 2025,
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 be
 like
 20,000
 or
 so.
 And


and
 just
 to
 confirm,
 how
 how
 do
 you


track
 the
 hires?
 Do
 do
 people
 record


like
 how
 how
 many
 people
 they
 have
 or
 is


this
 equity
 allocations?


>> Yeah.
 So
 it's
 equity
 allocations.
 So
 if


a
 new
 hire
 is
 granted
 equity,
 we
 do
 now


connect
 into
 many
 many
 many
 his
 systems


as
 well.
 Uh
 we
 we
 help
 people
 uh


actually
 you
 can
 compensate
 really


effectively
 using
 Carta
 to
 say
 here's


what
 the
 average
 engineer
 is
 making
 at


level
 five
 in
 San
 Francisco
 in
 salary


and
 equity.
 We
 have
 fantastic
 benchmarks


on
 that.
 So
 that's
 where
 this
 data
 comes


from.


>> Um,
 so
 to
 be
 clear,
 they
 they
 could
 be


this
 data
 does
 not
 include
 part-time
 or


consultants
 who
 do
 not


>> but
 it's
 it's
 it's
 comparing
 apples
 to


apples.
 So
 we
 know
 that
 startups,
 you


know,
 10
 years
 ago
 and
 5
 years
 ago,
 they


gave
 equity
 to
 their
 key
 staff.
 For


example,
 tech
 startups
 actually
 modern


startups
 give
 to
 all
 full-time


employees.
 Tech
 startups
 give
 to
 all


tech
 employees.
 So
 it's
 safe
 to
 say,
 you


know,
 there's
 a
 lot
 fewer
 people
 being


hired
 as
 full-time
 people
 who
 get


equity.
 And
 that's
 that's
 really
 the
 key


is
 that
 okay,
 if
 you
 look
 from
 22
 to
 23,


that
 massive
 decline
 in
 hiring,
 is
 that


AI?
 Probably
 not.
 That's
 mostly
 just


people
 having
 less
 funding.
 Less
 capital


means
 fewer
 hires.
 Easy.
 23
 to
 24.
 Also


true
 that
 funding
 is
 is
 a
 little
 bit


harder.
 So
 that's
 definitely
 a
 capital


question.
 Maybe
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 AI.
 But


24
 into
 25
 and
 25
 into
 26,
 we
 are
 just


flooded
 with
 stories
 of
 companies
 that


say,
 "Look,
 we
 have
 an
 engineering
 team


of
 10,
 instead
 of
 moving
 that
 to
 an


engineering
 team
 of
 11,
 each
 one
 of


those
 10
 engineers
 is
 just
 far
 more


productive
 than
 they
 used
 to
 be
 because


of
 AI
 tools.
 So
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 hire."


And
 so
 that
 is
 sort
 of
 expanded
 across


many,
 many
 companies
 over
 time,
 I
 think,


is
 starting
 to
 be
 an
 explanation
 that


makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 to
 me.
 I
 am
 not
 one


of
 those
 people
 that
 says
 AI
 is
 not


going
 to
 take
 jobs.
 I
 think
 it
 kind
 of


already
 is.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 I
 think
 the
 thing
 with
 AI


that
 we
 don't
 yet
 has
 have
 as
 much
 data,


but
 you
 know,
 Carter
 will
 probably


actually
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 data.
 The


question
 seems
 to
 be
 not
 if
 teams
 will


be
 smaller
 and
 they'll
 do
 more.
 And


actually,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 that
 in


in
 just
 a
 second.
 But
 whether
 we're


going
 to
 have
 more
 startups,
 more


smaller
 startups
 that
 are
 each
 doing


more,
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 have
 any
 answer.


But
 I
 think
 Carter
 is
 uniquely


positioned
 to
 later,
 you
 know,
 we
 might


get
 data
 in
 year
 or
 two
 with
 starter


formation
 and
 and
 how
 that's
 trending.


But
 speaking
 of
 teammates
 and
 a
 number


of
 people,
 what
 what
 are
 we
 seeing
 here?


>> Yeah,
 so
 you're
 totally
 right.
 But
 my


hope
 is
 that
 there
 are
 more
 startups,


oftentimes
 smaller
 teams
 moving
 fast.
 Uh


so
 that
 would
 kind
 of
 eclipse
 the


downturn
 in
 hiring.
 But
 if
 you
 just
 look


at
 the
 data
 as
 it
 is
 today,
 uh
 the


pattern
 is
 is
 again
 very
 clear.
 So
 if
 we


just
 focus
 on
 this
 series
 A
 column
 in


2022


on
 the
 day
 that
 you
 raised
 your
 series
 A


round
 companies
 on
 Carter
 were
 about
 had


about
 20
 to
 22
 full-time
 employees.


Today
 it's
 more
 like
 15
 full-time


employees
 and
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 I


think
 that's
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 more


like
 13
 or
 12.
 So
 from
 22
 to
 12


employees
 working
 at
 a
 series
 A
 startup


on
 the
 day
 they
 raise
 that
 round.
 So


this
 idea
 that
 small
 teams
 are
 all
 the


rage
 and
 people
 are
 trying
 to
 keep


headcount
 low
 and
 grow
 as
 fast
 as


possible
 just
 with
 the
 people
 that
 are


currently
 in
 the
 business.
 It's
 I
 think


it's
 very
 true
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 can
 be


wrapped
 up
 in
 this
 single
 metric
 that


everyone
 across
 Silicon
 Valley
 is
 now


talking
 about
 which
 is
 ARR
 per
 FTE.
 How


much
 revenue
 do
 you
 have
 for
 each


employee
 that
 works
 at
 the
 business
 as
 a


measure
 of
 how
 capital
 efficient
 you


are?
 That
 is
 a
 metric
 that
 many
 many


many
 more
 VCs
 are
 asking
 startups
 for


earlier
 and
 earlier
 in
 their
 life
 cycle.


>> So
 I
 is
 this
 new
 when
 did
 it
 start


happening
 and
 what
 what
 used
 to
 be
 the


benchmark
 you
 know
 five
 or
 10
 years


before?


>> It's
 not
 new
 necessarily
 in
 that
 it's


always
 been
 a
 metric
 that
 people
 care


about.
 What's
 different
 is
 the
 emphasis.


So
 well
 if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 2021
 literally


the
 point
 was
 grow
 as
 fast
 as
 possible


and
 if
 that
 means
 hire
 a
 bunch
 of
 people


hire
 a
 bunch
 of
 people.
 We
 don't


actually
 care
 that
 much
 about
 the


>> I
 guess
 the
 metrics
 were
 like
 monthly


average
 users,
 total
 number
 of
 users,


that
 kind
 of
 stuff,
 right?
 It
 wasn't


just
 about
 revenue


>> or
 just
 growth
 about
 ARR
 change.
 Yeah,


totally.


>> You
 know,
 I
 remember
 2020
 GitHub
 stars


was
 still
 a
 thing,
 which
 is
 kind
 of


funny.


>> Exactly.
 Literally,
 it
 just
 like
 any
 any


metric
 that
 you
 could
 choose
 that
 shows


explosive
 growth,
 that's
 what
 we
 want.


And
 then
 obviously
 as
 funding
 declines,


uh,
 businesses
 and
 their
 investors
 get
 a


lot
 more
 concerned
 with
 how
 much
 money


are
 you
 burning?
 What's
 your
 cash
 burn


per
 month?
 Um,
 and
 so
 you're
 trying
 to


remove
 that.
 And
 now
 we're
 in
 this
 place


where,
 again,
 I
 think
 this
 goes
 back
 to


the
 examples
 across
 the
 industry.
 If


it's
 possible
 to
 build
 a
 company
 that


has
 a hund00
 million
 of
 ARR
 with
 20


people,
 that's
 a
 more
 profitable,
 more


capital
 efficient
 company
 than
 the
 same


company
 with
 100
 million
 ARR
 that
 has


200
 people.
 So,
 this
 is
 data
 from


Silicon
 Valley
 Bank.
 So,
 this
 isn't
 from


Carta,
 but
 they're
 Silicon
 Valley
 Bank


still
 an
 ongoing
 concern,
 I
 promise,
 in


Silicon
 Valley.
 I
 know
 there
 was
 uh
 they


had
 a
 bad
 weekend,
 but
 they're
 they're


back.
 Um,
 and
 this
 is
 data
 on
 how
 much


ARR,
 so
 annual
 recurring
 revenue,
 does
 a


startup
 have
 at
 series
 A.
 And
 in
 2021,


the
 median
 startup
 had
 about
 a
 million


million
 and
 a
 half
 dollars
 in
 ARR.


>> Mhm.
 And
 AR,
 annual
 recurring
 revenue,


which
 which
 is
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 you


made
 that
 much
 last
 year,
 but
 you're
 on


track
 assuming,
 you
 know,
 you
 just
 keep


making
 what
 you
 make.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.
 Right.
 Um,
 and
 in


2024,
 it's
 nearly
 $3
 million.
 So
 it
 went


from
 1.3
 or
 so
 to
 three
 and
 the
 high
 end


the
 upper
 quartortile
 you
 know
 the


companies
 that
 are
 doing
 very
 well


exploded
 even
 further.
 I
 mean
 the


companies
 right
 now
 on
 the
 75th


percentile
 for
 ARR
 have
 about
 $7
 million


of
 ARR
 at
 series
 A


>> which
 is
 like
 six
 times
 as
 much
 in
 two


than
 it
 was
 in
 two
 years.


>> It's
 wildly
 high.
 And
 so
 that's
 what


investors
 are
 looking
 at.
 They're
 going,


"What
 are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 generational


companies
 of
 the
 future?"
 Well,
 if
 there


are
 companies
 that
 are
 growing
 at
 this


pace,
 you
 know,
 again,
 we
 get
 back
 to


that
 original
 point.
 Okay,
 growth
 just


doesn't
 cut
 it
 anymore.
 The
 metrics
 have


gotten
 a
 lot
 higher.


>> I
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 something
 really


important
 for
 people
 working
 at
 BC


funded
 companies
 to
 just
 understand
 and


also
 just
 to
 categorize
 their
 own


company
 accordingly.
 you
 know,
 you
 you


probably
 should
 have
 access
 to
 how
 much


revenue
 your
 company
 is
 is
 making
 and


you'll
 know
 how
 many
 people
 there
 are.


You
 can
 divide
 it
 and
 you'll
 know
 that.


I
 mean,
 based
 on
 this,
 you
 know,
 if
 if


we're
 seeing
 the
 series
 A
 companies


oftentimes
 have
 15
 people
 with
 7
 million


ARR,
 that's
 about
 $400,000
 per
 employee


revenue
 generated,
 which
 is
 wild


because,
 you
 know,
 like
 a
 compensation


or
 just
 the
 base
 salary
 of
 of of
 people.


I
 mean
 you
 have
 some
 other
 costs
 but


that
 might
 even
 push
 some
 companies
 into


profitable
 category
 if
 they
 don't
 have


high
 infrastructure
 or
 other
 costs.


>> Exactly
 right.
 I
 mean
 and
 that


profitability
 question
 is
 one
 that's


coming
 up
 a
 lot
 more
 frequently
 now.


It's
 always
 a
 debate
 about
 do
 you
 how


much
 this
 is
 actually
 the
 core
 question


across
 all
 of
 venture.
 It
 always
 is


which
 is
 how
 much
 money
 do
 you
 need?
 How


much
 money
 do
 you
 need
 to
 grow
 to
 be
 the


company
 at
 the
 scale
 that
 you
 want
 to


be?
 And
 it
 before
 AI,
 I
 think
 it
 was


pretty
 well
 established
 that
 if
 you


raised
 more
 money,
 you
 could
 use
 that


money
 to
 grow
 faster.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 now
 it's
 the
 question
 of
 well,
 if
 we


don't
 raise
 that
 money,
 can
 we
 still


grow
 as
 fast
 as
 if
 we
 had
 raised
 it?
 And


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 startups
 trying
 all


sorts
 of
 different
 ways
 to
 figure
 out


maybe
 we
 can
 get
 to
 profitability
 at


series
 A,
 which
 is
 very,
 very
 early
 on.


And
 then
 if
 we're
 profitable,
 we
 control


our
 options
 and
 we
 can
 fund
 raise
 if
 we


want
 to,
 but
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 because


we're
 a
 profitable
 business.


>> How
 important
 are
 valuations?
 And
 by
 the


way,
 what
 does
 price
 seed
 mean?
 In
 this


chart,
 we
 have
 price
 seed,
 series
 A,


series
 B,
 series
 C.
 I
 know
 what
 seed


round
 is.
 It's
 the
 first
 typically
 the


first
 time
 when
 you
 invest,
 you
 might


have
 an
 idea
 or
 might
 you
 might
 have
 a


product
 already.
 What
 is
 the
 price
 seed?


So
 in
 this
 case
 we
 said
 priced
 seed


round
 in
 to
 distinguish
 it
 between
 a


seed
 round
 that
 is
 done
 on
 priced
 equity


which
 is
 the
 normal
 you
 know
 you
 get


down
 you
 sit
 in
 a
 room
 with
 an
 investor


you
 come
 to
 an
 agreement
 on
 valuation


which
 means
 every
 one
 of
 the
 shares
 of


your
 company
 has
 a
 price
 you
 have
 a


price
 per
 share
 instead
 you
 could
 raise


a
 seed
 round
 and
 this
 is
 happening
 more


and
 more
 these
 days
 on
 safes
 simple


agreements
 for
 future
 equity
 and
 these


are
 this
 uh
 newish
 probably
 about
 10


years
 old
 at
 this
 point
 instrument
 that


was
 popularized
 by
 Y
 Combinator.
 Um,
 and


the
 safes
 are
 actually
 pretty
 fantastic.


They're
 this
 weird
 thing
 that
 doesn't


exist
 basically
 anywhere
 else
 in


finance.
 And
 the
 document
 is
 very


simple.
 It
 goes,
 I'm
 the
 investor.
 I'm


going
 to
 give
 you,
 the
 founder,
 some


money
 right
 now,
 and
 you're
 going
 to


give
 me
 equity
 in
 your
 business
 at
 some


point
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 that
 seems
 odd,


like
 why
 would
 an
 investor
 want
 that


deal?
 And
 it
 basically
 comes
 back
 to
 the


idea
 that
 valuing
 putting
 an
 actual


dollar
 value
 on
 the
 equity
 of
 a
 very


very
 small
 young
 startup
 is
 basically


impossible.
 You
 don't
 know
 where
 this


company's
 going to
 go.
 You
 don't
 know


how
 fast
 it's
 going
 to
 grow.
 This
 is
 b


this
 is
 an
 idea.
 It's
 a
 bet.
 It's
 not
 a


real
 company
 quite
 yet.
 So
 the
 safe
 is


great
 because
 the
 founder
 gets
 money
 to


build
 today
 and
 the
 investor
 gets
 the


promise
 of
 equity
 if
 things
 go
 well
 in


the
 future.
 Um,
 so
 that's
 the


distinction
 between
 a
 price
 round
 and
 a


safe
 round.


>> And
 and
 specifically
 for
 Y
 Combinator,


as
 I
 understand,
 they
 say
 we
 we'll
 give


you
 half
 a
 million
 dollars
 in
 in
 I
 think


uh
 different
 chunks
 in
 the
 future.
 Next


time
 you
 raise
 or
 the
 first
 time
 you


raise,
 we
 would
 like
 7%
 of
 your
 company


at
 whatever
 the
 valuation
 that
 might
 be.


Right.


>> Exactly.
 So
 they
 actually
 have
 two
 safes


each.
 Yeah.
 Little
 chunks
 of
 capital,


but
 uh
 most
 of
 the
 deals
 boil
 down
 to


we're
 going
 to
 give
 you
 500k
 for
 7%.
 Um,


and
 then
 we're
 also
 going
 to
 be


incentivized
 on
 the
 upside
 if
 you
 do


really
 really
 well.
 So,
 everyone
 or
 a


lot
 of
 people
 in
 the
 ecosystem
 look
 at
 Y


Combinator
 as
 the
 leader
 in
 early
 early


stage
 startups.
 They
 have
 an
 a
 fantastic


brand
 and
 it's
 an
 accelerator
 program


that
 hopefully
 takes
 your
 business
 from


idea
 stage
 maybe
 a
 couple
 customers
 to
 a


really
 significant
 business
 in
 a
 very


short
 amount
 of
 time.
 So,
 when
 we
 look


at
 YC,
 they
 definitely
 play
 a
 role
 in


making
 all
 of
 these
 things
 more
 popular.


like
 if
 YC
 does
 it,
 other
 investors
 are


likely
 to
 do
 it.


>> What
 do
 we
 see
 in
 the
 pricing
 change
 of


of
 valuations
 and
 and
 how
 important
 or


unimportant
 is
 it
 how
 high
 or
 low


valuation
 is?
 Because
 I
 have
 like
 two


kind
 of
 thoughts
 here.
 One
 is
 I'm
 just


thinking
 myself
 as
 a
 founder.
 Let's


just,
 you
 know,
 let's
 say
 you're
 a


software
 engineer,
 you
 became
 a
 founder


and
 you
 know,
 you're
 hoping
 to
 make
 it


big
 one
 day.
 Uh
 you're
 you're
 raising
 a


seed
 round.
 You
 have
 an
 idea.
 Uh
 and
 you


know,
 let's
 say
 you
 raise
 at
 like
 $20


million
 valuation.
 I'm
 just
 just
 telling


you
 something
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 you


raise
 half
 a
 million
 dollars
 and
 you


have
 the
 idea
 then
 you
 know
 the
 idea


starts
 to
 work
 out
 you
 get
 customers


you're
 going
 to
 raise
 a
 series
 A
 to


scale
 up
 that
 idea
 cuz
 now
 and
 then


you're
 going
 to
 raise
 it
 let's
 say
 $100


million
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and
 then


a
 series
 B
 let's
 say
 200
 series
 C
 higher


and
 higher
 you
 know
 clearly
 there's
 a


danger
 of
 like
 raising
 it
 too
 high


because
 at
 any
 point
 in
 time
 you
 you you


should
 have
 like
 if
 you're
 if
 you
 play


your
 cards
 right
 you
 might
 have
 the


option
 of
 being
 acquired
 if
 you're
 still


cheap
 enough
 if
 the
 business
 slows
 town,


etc.
 And
 if
 you're
 overpriced,
 that's


that's
 not
 great
 because
 your
 investors


might
 not
 want
 that.
 My
 my
 my
 question


is
 uh
 just
 first
 question
 is
 why
 is


there
 any
 incentive
 to
 to
 raise
 at
 a


high
 valuation?
 Like
 would
 it
 not
 make


sense
 to
 keep
 raising
 at
 a
 low


valuation?
 Uh
 because
 that
 will
 give
 you


a
 lot
 of
 exit
 options
 and
 you
 know
 if


you
 ever
 go
 public
 you'll
 be
 worth


whatever
 you
 know
 you're
 you're
 worth,


right?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 you've
 laid
 out
 a
 very


attractive
 pathway
 to
 some
 founders.


However,
 it
 does
 miss
 a
 lot
 of
 the


emotion
 that
 happens
 with
 earlystage


startups,
 which
 is
 it's
 kind
 of
 nice
 to


sit
 around
 and
 say,
 "I
 am
 a
 $50
 million


company.
 I
 am
 the
 founder
 of
 a
 $200


million
 company."
 And
 that
 when
 whenever


people
 say
 that,
 it
 is
 uh
 referencing


the
 post
 money
 valuation
 that
 is
 given


to
 a
 startup
 by
 investors.
 So
 actually


in
 times
 of
 exuberance
 a
 lot
 of
 people


will
 see
 valuations
 start
 to
 skyrocket


because
 there
 is
 so
 much
 excitement


about
 what
 this
 company
 could
 be
 in
 the


future.
 So
 let
 me
 let
 me
 put
 a
 couple


numbers
 on
 this.
 At
 seed
 stage
 right
 now


in
 the
 US
 the
 median
 valuation
 on
 Carta


is
 about
 $16
 million
 pre-
 money


>> and
 and
 pre
 pre-
 money
 means
 that


>> pre-
 money
 means
 the
 valuation
 of
 the


startup
 before
 the
 investment.
 Post


money
 is
 just
 that
 number
 plus
 however


much
 money
 you
 raised.
 Gotcha.


>> Because
 obviously
 the
 cash
 is
 the
 cash


is
 still
 cash.
 So
 you
 can
 just
 use
 it


for
 as
 as
 dollars.
 So
 if
 you
 raise
 a
 $3


million
 round
 on
 a
 $16
 million
 pre-


money
 valuation,
 that
 means
 your
 company


is
 worth
 post
 money
 $19
 million
 bucks.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 expensive.
 I
 mean,
 that
 is
 a


pretty
 expensive
 seedstage
 company.
 It's


actually
 more
 expensive
 than
 the


seedstage
 companies
 even
 were
 in
 2021.


Not
 not
 accounting
 for
 inflation.
 So


there's
 there's
 some
 differences
 there


>> because
 2021
 was
 the
 hottest
 market
 so


far.


>> 2021
 was
 this
 confluence
 of
 things
 that


made
 it
 incredibly
 frothy
 the
 way
 that


we
 talk
 about
 it.
 That's
 zero
 interest


rates
 for
 a
 decade,
 the
 pandemic


surplus.
 You
 remember
 all
 those


companies
 like
 Pelaton
 etc
 where
 the


digital
 pull
 forward
 like
 no
 one
 was


going
 to
 ever
 leave
 their
 homes
 again.


So
 all
 the
 digital
 companies
 are
 going


to
 make
 tons
 and
 tons
 of
 money.
 Zoom


great
 example.
 Um
 all
 that
 stuff
 was


happening
 in
 2021.
 It
 it
 was
 also
 the


best
 job
 market
 ever
 for
 software


engineers.
 You
 you
 could
 like
 double


your
 compensation
 just
 by
 going
 out
 to


interview.
 It
 it
 was
 ridiculous.
 It's


it's
 never
 been
 as
 good
 since.


>> Exactly.
 Yes.
 Uh
 don't
 don't
 compare


yourselves
 right
 now
 to
 your
 friends
 who


got
 jobs
 in
 2021
 because
 there's


probably
 fewer
 offer
 letters
 uh


available
 to
 you.
 No
 doubt.
 So
 that
 was


all
 the
 frothiness
 and
 then
 we
 had
 2022


where
 there
 was
 a
 downturn.
 2023
 another


downturn.
 People
 got
 you
 know
 interest


rates
 changed.
 all
 this
 stuff
 happened


and
 then
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 that
 downturn


the
 launch
 of
 chatbt
 and
 so
 you
 had
 a


downturn
 in
 venture
 plus
 a
 boom
 in
 AI


and
 so
 it's
 kind
 of
 conf
 this
 that's


what's
 showing
 on
 this
 chart
 right
 now


is
 AI
 companies
 in
 particular
 have


caught
 this
 new
 hype
 wave
 and
 everyone


is
 very
 excited
 about
 their
 prospects


and
 then
 non-AI
 companies
 are
 stuck
 kind


of
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 a
 downturn
 and
 so
 it


can
 be
 really
 confusing
 depending
 on


what
 company
 you're
 talking
 to
 venture


is
 either
 never
 been
 hotter
 or
 feels


really
 really
 cold.


>> Okay,
 this
 is
 really
 useful
 and
 it's


nice
 to
 see
 it
 in
 the
 data.
 Like
 I
 I


feel
 there's
 feelings
 and
 and
 I
 think


there
 is
 this
 feeling
 in
 general
 that
 if


you're
 for
 software
 engineering,
 if
 you


are
 an
 AI
 engineer,
 which
 means
 you're
 a


software
 engineer
 who
 has
 built
 LLM


integrations
 and
 and
 you're
 actually


very
 much
 in
 demand.
 But
 if
 you're
 a


full
 stack
 engineer
 who
 has
 never


touched
 AI
 or
 or
 and
 even
 though
 you're


really
 good
 at
 your
 job,
 you
 just
 see
 a


lot
 fewer
 job
 offers
 which
 I
 think
 it


ties
 back
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 things,


right?
 So


>> it
 ties
 exactly
 back
 to
 that
 and
 I
 would


say
 for
 the
 engineers
 listening
 like


that
 pattern
 is
 mirrored
 across
 every


part
 of
 startups.
 If
 you're
 a
 marketer,


if
 you're
 a
 business
 person,
 if
 you're
 a


salesperson,
 if
 you
 are
 in
 an
 AI
 company


or
 you
 have
 AI
 experience,
 it
 just
 is
 a


very
 different
 feeling
 right
 now
 in
 the


job
 market
 etc.
 than
 if
 you
 if
 you're


not.
 So
 engineers
 shouldn't
 feel
 like


they're,
 you
 know,
 being
 singled
 out


here.
 It's
 kind
 of
 true
 across
 the


board.


>> We
 we we
 talked
 about
 like
 like
 raising


things
 uh
 raising
 rounds.
 Then
 there's


this
 thing
 called
 bridge
 rounds.
 And
 I


have
 heard
 bridge
 rounds.
 So
 uh
 some
 of


my
 friends
 and
 people
 I
 knew
 in
 2021


they
 started
 they
 they
 started
 a
 nonAI


startup
 raised
 you
 know
 seed
 funding
 of


let's
 say
 two
 to
 three
 million.
 And
 what


I
 started
 to
 hear
 from
 them
 about
 a
 year


ago
 is
 we're
 not
 doing
 that
 great.
 We're


hoping
 for
 a
 bridge
 round.
 What
 is
 a


bridge
 round?


>> So,
 a
 bridge
 round
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 capital


typically
 given
 to
 startups
 by
 people


that
 are
 already
 investors.
 So,
 you


raised
 a
 seed
 round
 and
 then
 the
 same


people
 that
 you
 raised
 that
 seed
 round


from,
 you
 go
 back
 to
 them
 and
 say,


"Look,
 we
 couldn't
 get
 to
 series
 A
 the


way
 that
 we
 thought
 we
 could.
 We
 need
 a


little
 bit
 more
 cash
 today
 so
 that


hopefully
 we
 can
 then
 eventually
 get
 to


series
 A.
 Maybe
 it'll
 take
 longer
 than


we
 expected,
 but
 we
 still
 think
 we're
 a


good
 bet."
 So,
 that's
 a
 bridge.
 Bridges


are
 really
 interesting.
 So,
 you
 know,
 in


an
 ideal
 path,
 the
 startup
 goes
 from


seed
 to
 A
 to
 B.
 They're
 crushing
 it.


Everything's
 great.
 They
 don't
 need
 any


bridge
 capital.
 On
 a
 bridge
 round,
 you


kind
 of
 know,
 hey,
 this
 company
 didn't


do
 exactly
 what
 I
 thought
 they
 would,


but
 maybe
 I
 still
 love
 the
 founder.


Maybe
 I
 still
 believe
 in
 the
 business,


so
 I'm
 going to
 give
 them
 a
 little
 bit


more
 capital.
 Unfortunately,
 our
 data


shows
 pretty
 clearly
 that
 bridge
 rounds


are
 not
 usually
 good
 bets.


uh
 you
 know
 they
 the
 the
 percentage
 of


companies
 that
 make
 it
 from
 a
 seed
 to
 a


series
 A
 that
 had
 to
 do
 a
 bridge
 in
 the


middle
 is
 much
 lower
 than
 the
 ones
 that


didn't
 have
 to
 do
 a
 bridge.
 And
 that


that's
 kind
 of
 obvious,
 right?
 You


wouldn't
 be
 asking
 for
 more
 capital
 if


everything
 was
 going
 great.
 Um
 but


there's
 also
 distinctions
 within
 bridge


rounds.
 So
 there
 are
 sometimes
 bridges


that
 are
 done
 just
 as
 a
 normal
 round.


You
 get
 a
 new
 price
 per
 share,
 etc.
 And


then
 there
 are
 some
 bridge
 rounds
 that


are
 just
 done
 on
 safes
 or
 convertible


notes
 which
 are
 different
 funding


instruments.
 Yeah.


>> Which
 basically
 just
 kick
 the
 can
 down


the
 road
 and
 nobody
 has
 to
 make
 hard


choices.


>> Early
 stage
 startups,
 I
 think
 this
 is


potentially
 the
 biggest
 uh
 thing
 for


engineers
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 is
 you
 can


kind
 of
 get
 lost
 in
 the
 excitement
 and


you
 know
 a
 couple
 rounds
 of
 funding
 that


look
 fantastic.
 The
 vast
 majority
 of


early
 stage
 startups
 do
 not
 work
 out.


It's
 still
 most
 likely
 to
 go
 to
 zero.
 So


when
 you're
 thinking
 about
 the
 equity,


when
 you're
 thinking
 about
 the
 job


opportunity,
 you
 know,
 you
 might
 look
 at


these
 gigantic
 equity
 packages
 and
 get


really
 excited
 about
 owning
 1%
 of
 this


company,
 the
 likelihood
 that
 that
 1%


ever
 becomes
 real
 cash
 is
 very
 low.
 So


go
 into
 it
 with
 that
 expectation.
 This


is
 not
 working
 for
 Google
 or
 Meta.
 That


equity
 isn't
 necessarily
 going
 to
 be


worth
 even
 $1
 in
 the
 future.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 I
 see
 the
 data
 is
 really


interesting
 here.
 If
 we
 look
 a
 little


bit
 closer,
 if
 we
 go
 back
 to
 the
 bridge


round
 in
 2020,
 about
 33%
 of
 price
 bridge


rounds
 worked
 out.
 So,
 so
 from
 seed,


this
 company
 did
 get
 the
 series
 A
 after


they
 got
 extended,
 but
 then
 this
 dropped


in
 2021
 to
 16
 and
 in
 the
 2022
 to
 8%.


Which
 means
 it
 drops
 like
 four
 times.


Uh,
 which
 kind
 of
 suggests
 to
 me
 that
 in


2021
 the
 market
 was
 probably
 pretty
 good


to
 raise
 another
 round
 again.
 But
 I


guess
 the
 what
 what
 the
 data
 tells
 me
 is


like
 it's
 just
 probably
 good
 to
 be


realistic.
 If
 you're
 at
 a
 company
 that


raises
 a
 bridge
 round,
 again,
 it
 might


change
 with
 if
 you're
 an
 AI
 startup
 and


so
 on.
 But
 you
 know,
 like
 as
 per
 the


latest
 data,
 there
 might
 be
 a
 roughly
 8%


chance
 that
 your
 company
 will
 make
 it
 to


seed
 and
 probably
 92%
 or
 91%
 that
 it


might
 fold.
 Again,
 these
 are
 just


numbers,
 but
 you
 know,
 if
 I
 was
 a


engineer,
 that
 would
 be
 a
 cue
 for
 me
 if


my
 company's
 ringing
 a
 bridge
 round.
 Um


obviously
 you
 know
 see
 see
 how
 things


could
 work
 out
 but
 maybe
 take
 my


optimistic
 hat
 on
 and
 just
 start


networking
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 think
 about


like
 what
 next
 in
 in
 case
 because
 as
 as


you
 say
 you
 know
 startups
 are
 are
 pretty


risky
 especially
 early
 stage


>> 100%.
 Look,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 signals


around
 startups
 and
 this
 is
 this
 is
 good


and
 bad,
 right?
 So,
 in
 addition
 to
 a


bridge
 round,
 there
 are
 these
 things


called
 down
 rounds
 which
 just
 mean


anytime
 a
 company
 raises
 at
 a
 lower


valuation
 than
 what
 they
 raised
 at


before.
 And
 instinctively
 that
 shouldn't


be
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal,
 right?
 Like


Nvidia
 is
 worth
 X
 today
 and
 tomorrow
 it


might
 be
 worth
 a
 little
 bit
 less.
 Like


that's
 a
 public
 company.
 We
 know


everything
 possible
 about
 Nvidia
 and
 it


moves
 up
 and
 down
 and
 up
 and
 down.
 So
 of


course
 private
 companies
 uh
 with
 whom
 we


know
 far
 less
 about
 those
 actual


businesses
 they
 would
 also
 probably
 move


up
 and
 down
 but
 in
 culturally
 it
 doesn't


really
 work
 like
 that.
 like
 taking
 a


down
 round
 is
 often
 time
 this
 quote


unquote
 admission
 that
 things
 are
 not


working
 well
 and
 so
 much
 of
 startups
 is


optics
 and
 like
 trying
 to
 look
 like
 the


rocket
 ships
 and
 trying
 to
 manufacture


excitement
 not
 in
 a
 bad
 way
 but
 just


because
 there's
 so
 little
 information


available
 and
 so
 like
 a
 down
 round
 can


be
 really
 challenging
 for
 founders


because
 they
 got
 to
 go
 back
 to
 their


employees
 their
 engineers
 and
 say
 we
 are


worth
 less
 than
 we
 thought
 and
 when
 they


do
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 engineers
 might


think,
 okay,
 well,
 maybe
 it's
 time
 for


me
 to
 dust
 off
 my
 resume.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 guess
 this
 kind
 of
 answers


we
 talked
 about
 how
 to
 price
 rounds
 and


you
 were
 telling
 me
 it's
 really
 tempting


as
 a
 founder
 to
 say
 I
 own
 a
 $50
 million


company
 or
 $100
 million
 company.
 But
 I


guess
 as
 a
 founder,
 especially,
 you


know,
 you're
 let's
 say
 a
 lot
 of
 founders


exoft
 engineers,
 you
 want
 to
 keep
 in


mind
 that
 you
 want
 to
 price
 it
 so
 you


can
 go
 on
 without
 a
 down
 round
 even


let's
 say
 if
 you
 don't
 grow
 that
 that


fast.
 I
 cuz
 I
 can
 kind
 of
 see
 it
 like
 it


kind
 of
 sucks
 as
 an
 engineer
 to
 say
 we


worked
 for
 a
 year
 on
 this
 we
 have
 a
 lot


more
 things
 we've
 learned
 a
 lot
 more
 our


product
 is
 better
 we
 have
 more
 customers


and
 now
 we're
 worth
 less
 like
 how
 does


that
 make
 sense


>> how
 is
 that
 possible
 right
 and
 so
 two


points
 there
 one
 it
 it
 brings
 up
 that


classic
 scene
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 the
 HBO


show
 where
 you
 know
 they're
 at
 the
 bar


and
 the
 one
 of
 the
 founders
 is
 talking


about
 wait
 no
 one
 told
 me
 I
 could
 take


less
 money
 or
 no
 one
 told
 me
 I
 could


take
 a
 lower
 valuation


>> oh
 my
 Silicon
 Valley
 is
 so
 good


>> it's
 a
 documentary
 like
 It's
 absolutely


amazing.
 Um,
 and
 the
 other
 thing
 in
 that


is
 yes,
 founders
 who
 are
 more
 realistic


about
 their
 valuation
 jumps
 can
 often


like
 keep
 moving
 forward
 uh
 in
 a
 way


that's
 difficult,
 but
 the
 rest
 of
 the


market
 is
 also
 moving.
 So,
 this
 is
 why,


you
 know,
 you
 look
 at
 the
 years
 2020,


2021,
 2022,
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 those


companies
 were
 probably
 doing
 really


well
 in
 2020
 and
 then
 2021
 hit
 and
 there


were
 companies
 that
 were
 doing
 even


better
 than
 them.
 So
 yeah,
 you're
 a
 good


company,
 but
 if
 you're
 not
 the
 best


company
 that
 that
 series
 A
 investor
 saw


that
 quarter
 or
 that
 year,
 then
 you


still
 might
 not
 get
 funded
 even
 though


your
 business
 is
 doing
 well
 because
 it's


always
 in
 comparison
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the


pool
 of
 startups.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 in
 tech
 there
 were
 a


few
 years
 where
 it
 was
 easy
 to
 get


comfortable
 to
 get
 used
 to,
 you
 know,


all
 the
 startups
 started
 to
 become
 a


little
 bit
 the
 same.
 And
 I
 guess,
 you


know,
 AI
 switches
 us
 up
 and
 it
 just


reminds
 us
 that
 like
 hey,
 you
 know,
 like


it's
 it's it's
 a
 it's
 a
 competition.


It's
 fun
 and
 exciting.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 think


that's
 a
 good
 way
 to
 look
 at
 it
 because


otherwise
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 depressed


about
 all
 all
 the


>> 100%
 and
 I
 I'll
 make
 a
 I'll
 make
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 plug
 here.
 I
 I
 think


working
 at
 startups
 is
 absolutely
 like


incredible.
 I
 couldn't
 imagine
 not


working
 at
 a
 Carter
 is
 the
 biggest
 place


I've
 ever
 worked
 by
 a
 lot.
 So,
 I'm
 after


Carter,
 I'm
 definitely
 going
 to
 go
 back


to
 someplace
 smaller.
 But,
 it's
 not


necessarily
 I'm
 sitting
 there
 going
 this


is
 a
 compensation
 maximizing
 move.
 It's


a
 responsibility
 maximizing
 move.
 like


you'll
 just
 have
 much
 more
 agency
 to


build
 the
 things
 that
 you
 want
 at
 a


place
 that
 is
 200
 people
 versus
 a
 place


that's
 2,000
 or
 20,000.
 Yeah,
 there's


this
 really
 good
 quote
 of
 of
 which
 an


anonymous
 VC
 called
 Startup
 LJ
 Jackson


about
 10
 years
 ago
 and
 he
 wrote
 an


article
 saying
 uh
 how
 to
 get
 rich
 in


like
 I
 think
 two
 or
 three
 simple
 two
 or


three
 simple
 steps
 and
 it
 was
 like
 step


one
 get
 a
 get
 a
 job
 at
 a
 at
 a
 big
 tech


step
 two
 work
 there
 for
 like
 10
 years


and
 then
 he
 goes
 on
 to
 to
 to
 do
 the
 same


thing
 and
 to
 say
 what
 what
 you
 just
 said


which
 is
 at
 a
 startup
 you're
 not
 going


to
 maximize
 your
 compensation
 he
 said


that
 you're
 You
 said
 responsibility.
 He


said
 you're
 going
 to
 maximize
 your


learning
 and
 again
 set
 you
 up
 for
 a
 lot


of
 things
 including
 a
 really
 highpaying


job
 in
 the
 f
 future
 more
 responsibility


or
 a
 spot
 on
 the
 next
 rocket
 ship.
 You


know
 that
 like
 open
 AI
 when
 they
 were


small
 I'm
 assuming
 they
 mostly
 hired


people
 who
 worked
 at
 startups.


>> Yes.


>> Not
 not
 big
 companies
 and
 you
 know
 like


that
 that
 helps.


>> Would
 have
 been
 nice
 to
 join
 you
 know


five
 or
 six
 years
 ago
 at
 OpenAI.


Definitely.
 Yes.
 That
 was
 a
 win.
 So,


we're
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 summer
 and
 you


posted
 a
 very
 interesting
 thing
 just


recently.
 Can
 you
 raise
 VC
 in
 the


summer?
 You
 know,
 people
 people
 go
 on


holiday
 uh
 at
 at
 least
 at
 companies.


What
 does
 the
 data
 say
 because
 this
 is


this
 is
 pretty
 timely
 for
 this
 summer


and
 also
 for
 next
 summer.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 funny
 one
 because


you
 know
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 it's
 very
 easy


to
 you
 know
 take
 shots
 at
 VCs
 because
 uh


they're
 the
 ones
 with
 the
 capital
 and
 if


you're
 a
 founder
 and
 they're
 not
 uh


being
 you
 know
 you're
 not
 having
 a
 good


time
 raising
 deals
 like
 it's
 an
 easy


target.
 no
 problem.
 And
 then
 there's
 a


stereotype
 of
 course
 that
 all
 VCs
 are


incredibly
 wealthy
 and
 then
 they
 spend


July
 and
 August
 on
 yachts
 or
 at
 Burning


Man.
 Those
 that's
 what
 they
 do
 in
 July


and
 August.
 So
 like
 don't
 even
 talk
 to


me.
 Don't
 don't
 hit
 my
 email
 box
 in


those
 two
 months.
 Our
 data
 shows
 that's


not
 exactly
 true.
 You
 definitely
 can


still
 raise
 rounds
 in
 the
 summer.
 And


also
 by
 the
 way
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 VCs


are
 not
 these
 super
 wealthy
 people.
 They


are
 emerging
 managers
 who
 have
 small


funds
 and
 they're
 effectively
 building


their
 own
 businesses
 just
 like
 founders


are
 building
 theirs.
 So
 respect
 to
 those


emerging
 managers.
 Um
 the
 data
 shows


that
 you
 can
 raise
 money
 in
 June,
 July


and
 August.
 I
 would
 definitely
 say
 so


this
 this
 data
 that
 we're
 showing
 here


is
 by
 the
 date
 that
 the
 deal
 was


actually
 signed.


>> So
 obviously


>> so
 that's
 not
 necessarily
 when
 it's


announced,
 right?
 That
 can
 be
 different.


>> Totally.
 It's
 not
 when
 it's
 announced,


which
 is
 an
 advantage
 of
 Carta's
 data


set
 because
 we
 have
 the
 actual


documents,
 but
 it's
 also
 not
 when
 it
 was


negotiated.
 So
 you're
 probably


negotiating
 that
 deal
 for
 a
 month
 or
 two


before
 it's
 signed.
 Right?
 So
 yeah,


>> if
 if
 I
 were
 a
 founder,
 I
 would
 probably


not
 kick
 off
 a
 fund
 raise
 and
 just


announce
 that
 we
 are
 fundraising
 in
 late


August.


>> But
 if
 you're
 already
 in
 a
 deal
 cycle,


if
 you're
 already
 talking
 to
 VCs
 as


summer
 hits,
 it's
 not
 like
 they
 don't


answer
 email,
 right?
 They
 will
 do
 those


deals.
 They
 will
 start,
 they
 will
 keep


signing
 deals,
 and
 then
 you
 can
 see
 it


dips.
 Actually,
 the
 worst
 month
 for


signed
 deals
 across
 the
 board
 almost


always
 is
 January,
 which
 kind
 of
 makes


sense.
 like
 people
 want
 to
 get
 all
 this


stuff
 done
 before
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,


then
 they
 kind
 of
 take
 January
 to
 uh


recuperate.

 And
 it's


so
 interesting
 to
 look
 at
 this
 data.
 I'm


just
 looking
 at
 2023
 and
 2024
 just


because
 they're
 relevant,
 but
 just


taking
 it
 in
 mind
 that
 there's
 a


negotiation
 leading
 up
 to
 this.
 you


know,
 deals
 signed
 are
 super
 low
 in


January,
 pretty
 low
 in
 in
 February,
 and


they're
 also
 pretty
 low
 in
 September,


which
 suggests
 to
 me
 that
 in
 the


previous
 month,
 you
 know,
 negotiations


are
 not
 really
 happening,
 which,
 you


know,
 if
 the
 deals
 are
 signed
 fewer
 in


January,
 in
 December,
 there
 were
 fewer


negotiations.
 If
 in
 September
 there's
 a


drop
 because
 probably
 in
 August,
 there's


not
 as
 many,
 but
 and
 the
 other
 thing


that
 stands
 out
 to
 me
 is
 in
 April
 and


December,
 wow,
 those
 are
 like
 popping.


and
 also
 in
 in
 July
 which
 kind
 of


suggests
 that
 like
 in
 March
 you
 know
 in


the
 spring
 bunch
 of
 deals
 come
 together


in
 November
 there's
 this
 mad
 rush


probably
 to
 like
 close
 deals
 and


curiously
 in
 June
 beginning
 of
 the


summer
 there
 might
 also
 be
 really


interesting
 to
 work
 backwards
 from
 this


this
 data


>> yeah
 and
 it's
 you
 know
 the
 big
 question


that
 comes
 out
 of
 this
 is
 how
 long
 does


it
 take
 right
 how
 long
 should
 I
 expect


to
 be
 negotiating


>> and
 that
 is
 highly
 variable
 if
 you
 are


uh
 let's
 use
 the
 the
 wild
 example
 if
 you


are
 Sam
 Alman


you
 can,
 you
 know,
 you
 can
 have
 a


billion
 dollars
 at
 your
 door
 tomorrow


morning,
 no
 problem.
 If
 you
 are
 not
 Sam


Alman,
 uh,
 what's
 happened,
 especially


in
 the
 last
 year
 or
 two,
 is
 that
 due


diligence
 in
 deals,
 the
 actual
 research


that
 the
 VC
 does
 to
 make
 themselves
 feel


comfortable
 about
 giving
 your
 company


money,
 that
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 taking


longer
 and
 longer.
 So,
 they're
 asking


more
 questions.
 They're
 interviewing


customers,
 they're
 going
 through
 your


financials
 in
 a
 more
 close
 quarters
 way.


So
 the
 diligence
 I
 think
 has
 increased


from
 VCs
 as
 the
 number
 of
 rounds
 has


decreased.
 So
 it
 does
 take
 a
 little
 bit


longer
 than
 it
 used
 to.


>> Again
 just
 thinking
 as
 as
 an
 employee
 or


or
 as
 a
 engineer
 working
 at
 a
 startup


especially
 at
 early
 stage
 I
 guess
 it


could
 be
 smart
 to
 ask
 questions
 or
 keep


a
 tabs
 on
 how
 much
 money
 your
 company


has
 and
 and
 know
 you
 know
 when
 the


company
 might
 and
 figure
 out
 what
 the


burn
 is
 basically
 how
 much
 it's
 it's


spending
 per
 month.
 I
 guess
 in
 smaller


companies
 this
 should
 be
 open
 at
 least


and
 then
 work
 your
 way
 backwards
 like


you
 know
 again
 you
 can
 get
 some
 some
 red


flags
 a
 famous
 example
 is
 fast
 uh
 which


went
 bankrupt
 unfortunately
 it's
 a


oneclick
 checkout
 a
 lot
 of
 staff
 was
 was


really
 caught
 off
 guard
 by
 suddenly
 the


company
 shutting
 down
 operations
 because


it
 ran
 out
 of
 money
 but
 if
 you
 would


have
 had
 access
 to
 this
 information
 or
 I


think
 that
 company
 didn't
 disclose
 it


for
 for
 some
 reason
 but
 but
 again
 uh


they
 could
 have
 worked
 a
 bit
 backwards


and
 again
 do
 these
 probability
 models
 of


like,
 hey,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 a
 bit


higher
 risk.
 Let
 let
 me
 look
 around.
 Let


me
 maybe
 answer
 some
 recruited
 messages


from
 elsewhere.


>> Totally.
 That's
 a
 I
 mean,
 it's
 an


interesting
 concept,
 which
 is
 how


transparent
 is
 the
 founder
 with
 these


sort
 of
 metrics.
 I
 guess
 you
 could
 make


a
 case
 for
 or
 against,
 you
 know,
 extreme


transparency
 depending
 on
 where
 you
 sit


in
 the
 business,
 etc.
 But
 I
 think


overall
 one
 of
 the
 indications
 of
 a


great
 founder
 is
 their
 willingness
 to


educate
 and
 be
 transparent
 with
 their


underlying
 employee
 base.
 So,
 uh,
 if


you're
 at
 a
 company
 where
 it
 feels
 like


everything
 is
 incredibly
 secret
 and


there's
 all
 these
 rumors,
 but
 no
 one


really
 knows
 what's
 going
 on,
 that


that's
 a
 cultural
 thing
 that
 comes
 from


the
 top.
 Generally
 speaking,


>> I
 think
 this
 is
 also
 why
 it
 can
 be


tempting
 to
 go
 to
 an
 early
 stage
 startup


where
 founders
 are
 more
 open.
 you
 can


learn
 more
 about
 the
 business
 and
 you


can
 figure
 out
 like
 hey
 do
 I
 want
 to
 be


a
 founder
 one
 day
 or
 you
 can
 actually


hopefully
 you
 can
 get
 you
 can
 be
 a
 bit


closer
 to
 this
 and
 by
 the
 way
 at
 some
 of


those
 startups
 as
 an
 engineer
 if
 you


become
 a
 lead
 you
 you
 might
 have
 a
 shot


becoming
 head
 of
 engineering
 or
 CTO


where
 you
 now
 sit
 in
 the
 board
 meetings


and
 you
 actually
 understand
 how
 it
 works


and
 again
 I
 have
 friends
 who
 who
 are
 on


on
 boards
 again
 it's
 not
 as
 scary
 as
 it


looks
 but
 again
 you
 need
 to
 get
 there


first


>> you
 do
 need
 to
 get
 there
 and
 you
 know


there
 is
 nothing
 more
 valuable
 to
 a


startup
 than
 and
 an
 engineer
 who
 deeply


understands
 the
 business
 as
 well.
 I


think
 that's
 like
 a
 really
 really


important
 person.


>> Yeah,
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 of


this.
 So,
 uh
 an
 interesting
 topic
 we
 we


talked
 about
 before
 is
 how
 AI
 might


might
 or
 might
 not
 be
 changing
 startups


because
 we
 we
 know
 uh
 about
 two
 years


ago
 or
 two
 and
 a
 half
 years
 ago,
 Chad


GPT
 blew
 everything
 out
 of
 the
 water
 and


everything
 we
 see
 in
 VC
 has
 this
 impact.


So,
 what
 does
 the
 data
 say?


>> AI
 has
 changed
 the
 way
 that
 startups
 are


being
 built.
 Hands
 down.
 There's
 no


denying
 that
 AI
 is
 making
 startups
 build


in
 different
 ways
 with
 different
 kinds


of
 teams
 and
 it's
 it's
 a
 sea
 change
 in


the
 way
 that
 startups
 are
 being
 built.


We
 don't
 know
 yet
 if
 all
 of
 those


startups
 are
 going
 to
 end
 up
 being
 as


valuable
 as
 some
 of
 the
 VCs
 think,
 but


certainly
 you
 have
 examples,
 OpenAI


being
 the
 biggest
 one,
 of
 startups
 that


are
 deeply
 embedded
 in
 the
 AI
 wave
 that


are
 going
 to
 be
 generational
 companies.


Um,
 but
 at
 the
 very
 earliest
 part,
 this


is
 a
 chart
 that
 we
 put
 out
 a
 while
 ago,


which
 is
 this
 is
 looking
 at
 all
 startups


on
 Carta.
 So,
 not
 just
 the
 ones
 that


took
 VC
 capital,
 but
 both
 VC
 startups


and
 nonVC
 startups.
 And
 one
 of the


clearest
 findings
 is
 that
 solo
 founded


companies,
 so
 literally
 just
 one


founder,
 have
 become
 more
 and
 more


common
 over
 time.
 They're
 taking
 greater


and
 greater
 share
 of
 startups.
 And
 that


is
 for,
 I'd
 hope,
 pretty
 obvious


reasons,
 right?
 the
 as
 the
 cost
 of


creating
 a
 business
 comes
 down
 as
 you


can
 do
 more
 as
 a
 single
 person,
 well


maybe
 you
 just
 you
 used
 to
 have
 to
 have


a
 co-founder
 but
 you
 just
 get
 started


yourself.
 Um
 and
 so
 solo
 founded


companies
 are
 more
 common
 today
 than


they
 ever
 have
 been
 in
 the
 last
 10


years.


>> And
 there's
 been
 a
 big
 jump
 in
 2023
 and


2024
 like
 way
 bigger
 than
 especially
 in


2024.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 in
 2024
 it
 was
 over
 a


third
 of
 startups
 uh
 that
 were
 founded


that
 use
 Carta
 are
 solo
 founded
 startups


which
 is
 the
 highest
 it's
 ever
 been.
 Now


I
 do
 expect
 that
 number
 to
 come
 down
 a


little
 bit
 because
 often
 what
 happens
 is


by
 year
 two
 or
 three
 that
 solo
 founder


has
 decided
 oh
 I'm
 going
 to
 bring
 on
 a


co-founder


>> co-founder.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 so
 it'll
 probably
 modulate
 a
 bit
 but


the
 pattern
 is
 very
 very
 clear.
 Um
 the


flip
 side
 of
 that
 pattern
 though
 is
 VCs


and
 this
 is
 the
 chart
 we're
 showing
 now.


VCs
 still
 have
 trouble
 funding
 solo


founders.


>> They
 don't
 love
 them.


>> This
 is
 very
 different
 if
 if
 you
 know
 I


just
 between
 the
 two
 we
 saw
 solo


founders
 companies
 going
 up.
 But
 here


the
 funded
 companies
 for
 solo
 founders


have
 stayed
 the
 same
 pretty
 much.


>> Yeah
 it's
 you
 know
 it's
 about
 35%
 of


companies
 on
 Carta
 are
 solo
 founded.
 But


if
 you
 just
 look
 at
 those
 who
 have


received
 VC
 funding,
 it's
 about
 17%
 in


2024.
 So
 that's
 a
 big
 gap.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 when
 we
 talk
 to
 VCs,
 they
 have
 a
 lot


of
 reasons
 why
 they
 don't
 love
 solo


founders.
 The
 older
 reasons
 used
 to
 be,


well,
 it's
 very
 important
 to
 have
 a


technical
 lead
 and
 a
 business
 lead.
 That


was
 a
 that
 was
 a
 very,
 you
 know,


archetype
 of
 a
 founding
 team.
 It
 also


comes
 to
 the
 idea
 of
 key
 person
 risk.
 if


you
 know
 I've
 invested
 in
 this
 founder


and
 she
 gets
 hit
 by
 a
 bus,
 oh
 well
 there


goes
 my
 whole
 investment.
 Now
 how
 often


do
 they
 get
 hit
 by
 a
 bus?
 Very
 rarely.


So
 we
 can
 maybe
 discount
 that
 a
 little


bit.
 Um
 and
 then
 the
 I
 think
 the
 hidden


reason
 uh
 oftent
 times
 is
 because
 there


is
 this
 kind
 of
 unspoken
 idea
 that
 if


you
 can't
 convince
 a
 co-founder
 to
 join


you,
 you're
 really
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 convince
 anyone
 else.
 So
 like
 it's


kind
 of
 an
 idea
 that
 you
 know
 one
 of


your
 key
 roles
 as
 a
 founder
 is
 to


attract
 talent.
 If
 you're
 unable
 to
 do


that
 at
 the
 co-founding
 level,
 it's
 only


going
 to
 get
 harder
 when
 you're
 offering


less
 and
 less
 equity
 to
 the
 other


employees.
 So
 that's
 an
 idea
 we
 can


debate
 whether
 or
 not
 that's
 true.
 But
 I


think
 the
 data
 is
 very
 clear
 that
 VCs


tend
 to
 not
 love
 co
 solo
 founders.


>> I
 think
 the
 fascinating
 thing
 for
 me
 is


just
 how
 AI
 clearly
 is
 or
 it
 likely
 is


changing
 how
 businesses
 are
 are
 now


started
 solo.
 But
 the
 funding
 has
 not


changed.
 So
 people
 risking
 their
 own


money
 or
 while
 VCs
 risking,
 you
 know,


their
 their
 investors
 money.
 This
 this


is
 really
 interesting.
 I
 think
 it's


worth
 worth
 reflecting
 on
 things
 that


might
 not
 change
 even
 with
 AI,
 right?


Like
 again,
 you
 know,
 like
 there
 there's


some
 fundamental
 things.
 For example,


the
 economy
 as
 a
 whole
 will
 have
 about


the
 same
 disposable
 income
 and
 they
 will


still
 spend
 it
 on
 on
 stuff,
 right?
 Like


you're
 not
 going
 to
 magically
 have
 like


twice
 as
 much
 income
 and
 and
 and
 so
 on.


But
 one
 of
 these
 things
 is
 like
 yeah


personal
 dynamics
 at
 a
 startup
 might


still
 be
 really
 really
 important.


>> Totally.
 Or
 it
 could
 be
 the
 case
 that


what
 we
 need
 what
 we
 need
 more
 of
 is


this
 these
 resonant
 examples.
 So
 if
 for


instance
 cursor
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 bold


or
 lovable
 and
 all
 these
 places
 had
 been


started
 by
 solo
 founders
 and
 were
 just


skyrocketing
 well
 maybe
 VCs
 would
 go
 oh


now
 that's
 the
 new
 thing
 and
 we
 got
 to


get
 in
 on
 more
 solo
 founders.
 It
 really


is
 a
 a
 bit
 like
 we
 have
 to
 have
 a
 meme.


We
 have
 to
 have
 something
 to
 look
 at
 in


order
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 the
 next
 thing


is
 quote
 unquote.


>> Interesting
 enough,
 by
 the
 way,
 speaking


of
 of
 Kurser,
 they
 as
 I
 recall,
 they


have
 three
 co-founders.


So,
 an
 unusually
 high
 number
 and
 I


personally
 found
 that
 I
 observing
 them,


I
 think
 they
 do
 better
 because
 of
 those


three
 co-founders.
 They
 step
 in


a
 founder
 is
 always
 there.
 I
 remember


they
 had
 a
 a
 bit
 of
 embarrassing


incident
 where
 an
 AI
 bot
 responded
 to


people
 with
 wrong
 information.
 Something


went
 viral
 on
 Reddit
 and
 the
 founder


appeared,
 one
 of
 the
 co-founders
 saying,


"I'm
 the
 co-founder."
 They
 took


ownership
 of
 that
 situation
 and


immediately
 resolved
 it
 and
 people
 moved


on
 and
 meanwhile
 the
 other
 other


founders
 were
 working
 on
 new
 things.
 So,


you
 know,
 like
 we
 see
 an
 example
 where


actually
 this
 stereotype
 is
 at
 least


with
 cursor
 and
 and
 they
 are
 the
 fastest


growing
 uh
 dev
 tools
 startup
 and
 so
 on.


So,
 so
 yeah,
 interesting.


>> You
 know,
 it
 can
 be
 nice
 to
 build
 with


the
 team.
 No
 doubt.


>> So,
 let's
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


equity.
 Uh
 I
 uh
 so
 as
 as
 an
 employee,
 uh


when
 I
 join
 a
 a
 startup,
 uh
 I
 mean
 as
 a


sex
 startup,
 you
 should
 be
 getting


equity
 as
 a
 software
 engineer.
 Like
 I


know
 there's
 companies
 that
 that
 don't


give,
 but
 in
 in
 the
 US
 especially
 or
 US


companies
 and
 even
 European
 companies,


they
 generally
 do
 because
 uh
 it's
 it's
 a


great
 way
 to
 have
 you
 aligned
 with
 the


outcome.
 Plus
 uh
 these
 companies
 cannot


pay
 as
 much
 as
 some
 of
 the
 big
 tech
 come


and
 and
 this
 is
 seen
 as
 as
 some
 of
 the


you
 know
 way
 to
 compensate.
 When


startups
 give
 you
 equity
 they
 give
 you


to
 from
 a
 so-called
 equity
 employee


options
 pool
 which
 is
 the
 percentage
 of


the
 company
 that
 they
 reserve
 for


employees.
 Why
 is
 it
 important
 and
 how


big
 this
 pool
 is?
 How
 is
 it
 changing
 and


can
 you
 explain
 what
 this
 what
 what
 this


graph
 is?


>> Sure.
 So
 the
 startup
 employee
 option


pool
 or
 often
 referred
 to
 as
 ESOP
 or


just
 the
 pool


>> ESOP.
 Yep.


>> Um
 is
 this
 idea
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 say


say
 you
 had
 a
 100%
 of
 this
 equity
 pie
 so


you
 can
 give
 out
 little
 slices
 to
 as


many
 people
 as
 you
 want.
 Oftentimes
 what


startups
 will
 do
 is
 they'll
 say
 we're


going
 to
 reserve
 a
 portion
 of
 that
 pie


for
 employees
 because
 we
 know
 one
 we're


going
 to
 hire
 employees
 and
 two
 we
 want


to
 incentivize
 those
 employees
 with


equity
 and
 it's
 easier
 for
 us
 to
 do
 that


if
 we
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 that
 pie
 that
 is


just
 kind
 of
 cordoned
 off
 just
 for


employees.


Often
 times
 uh
 in
 the
 you
 know
 in
 the


last
 5
 or
 10
 years
 investors
 would
 say


well
 you
 need
 to
 start
 that
 option
 pool


at
 maybe
 15
 or
 even
 20%.
 which
 is
 a
 lot


of
 equity.
 These
 days,
 that's
 not
 the


case.
 So,
 option
 pools
 will
 start
 as
 low


as
 five
 or
 even
 10%
 of
 the
 business.
 And


then
 every
 time
 you
 fund
 raise,
 you


expand
 the
 option
 pool.
 And
 this
 makes


intuitive
 sense,
 right?
 You're
 going
 out


for
 your
 series
 A.
 When
 you're
 in


conversations
 with
 those
 investors,


you'll
 say,
 you
 know,
 in
 order
 to
 get
 to


series
 B,
 we
 think
 we
 need
 another
 five


or
 10
 people.
 Here's
 the
 kind
 of
 people


we're
 going
 to
 go
 look
 to
 hire,
 and


here's
 how
 much
 equity
 we're
 going
 to


grant
 them.
 So
 by
 that
 then
 the


investors
 can
 go
 good
 plan
 we're
 going


to
 expand
 the
 option
 pool
 a
 little
 bit


so
 that
 you
 have
 enough


>> equity
 which
 means
 you
 add
 more
 shares


because
 you
 can
 always
 create
 shares
 in


fundraising
 and
 obviously
 the
 investors


everyone
 has
 to
 agree
 because
 their


share
 might
 you
 know
 be
 a
 bit
 smaller.


>> Exactly.
 So
 that's
 the
 concept
 of


dilution
 which
 is
 as
 you
 add
 more
 shares


as
 you
 literally
 create
 shares
 out
 of


thin
 air
 everybody
 else's
 shares
 are


worth
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 in
 terms
 of
 the


percentage
 of
 the
 pie.
 And
 this
 is
 this


concept
 is
 deceptively
 simple
 but
 it


actually
 drives
 so
 much
 around
 startups.


When
 I
 talk
 to
 people
 who
 are
 not
 in


startups
 oftentimes
 what
 they
 think
 is


happening
 is
 somebody
 is
 given
 shares


and
 then
 those
 shares
 are
 taken
 away


from
 them
 and
 given
 to
 somebody
 else.


That's
 not
 how
 it
 works.
 Your
 shares
 are


yours.
 What
 happens
 is
 there's
 just
 more


shares
 created.
 So
 your
 original
 10,000


shares
 don't
 represent
 as
 big
 a
 portion


of
 the
 pie
 as
 they
 used
 to
 because
 this


pie
 is
 now
 just
 getting
 bigger
 and


bigger.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 this
 is
 something


again
 uh
 it's
 I
 guess
 it's
 a
 good


problem
 or
 a
 rare
 problem
 to
 have
 should


I
 say
 but
 there
 are
 some
 starter


employees
 who
 have
 been
 early
 employees


at
 a
 company
 uh
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the


earliest
 employees
 let's
 say
 and
 then


they
 left
 a
 few
 years
 later
 and
 you
 know


let's
 say
 they
 leave
 and
 five
 years


later
 that
 company
 gets
 acquired
 they


raise
 more
 rounds
 of
 funding
 and
 on


paper
 this
 is
 a
 great
 company
 because


you
 know
 when
 the
 employee
 was
 there


they
 raised
 $5
 million
 and
 then
 they


raised
 another
 $40
 million
 and
 they
 got


sold
 for
 let's
 say
 $60
 million.
 So,
 you


know,
 lots
 of
 money.
 And
 then
 the


employee
 gets
 their
 check
 on
 how
 much


their
 thing
 is
 worth.
 And
 as
 far
 as
 they


know,
 they
 own
 they
 last
 time
 they
 owned


half
 a
 percent
 of
 the
 company,
 which


would
 be
 a
 big
 number.
 And
 it's
 a
 really


small
 number.
 And
 it's
 because
 of


delilution,
 because
 of
 how,
 you
 know,


preferences
 work.
 But
 I
 I'
 I've
 actually


know
 someone
 personally
 who
 was
 like


deeply
 disappointed
 because
 they
 really


thought
 as
 an
 oil
 employee
 that
 they


they
 would
 have
 that
 whatever


percentage.
 They
 just
 didn't
 understand


that
 dilution
 over
 several
 rounds
 can


actually
 make
 a
 big
 difference.


dilution
 is
 really
 tough.
 I
 mean,
 it
 is


why
 venture
 capital
 is
 so
 hard
 um


because
 of
 that
 uh
 preference
 stack
 that


you
 just
 mentioned.
 So,
 an
 easy
 way
 for


employees
 to
 think
 about
 this
 is
 if
 your


company
 was
 bought
 today,
 your
 investors


who
 invested
 in
 that
 company
 get
 paid


out
 first
 and
 they
 get
 paid
 out


generally
 speaking
 at
 a
 1x
 liquidation


multiple.
 Which
 means
 if
 I
 give
 this


founder
 $10
 million
 and
 they
 sell
 for


$20
 million,
 I
 get
 the
 first
 10
 million


back.
 I
 get
 my
 initial
 stake
 back
 before


anybody
 else
 gets
 any
 money.
 If
 you've


raised
 a
 billion
 dollars
 and
 then
 the


company
 gets
 bought
 for
 $1.2
 billion,


the
 sticker
 price,
 everyone
 is
 super


excited
 on
 Twitter
 because
 it
 says
 $1.2


billion.
 How
 exciting.
 But
 of
 course,


there's
 only
 200
 million
 of
 that
 that
 is


shared
 amongst
 the
 employees
 and
 the


founders.
 The
 investors
 take
 their


initial
 stake
 back
 first.
 So
 it
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 examples
 of
 people
 with
 amazing


big
 dollar
 values
 on
 the
 headline
 and


then
 it
 ends
 up
 that
 the
 employees


didn't
 actually
 make
 very
 much
 from
 that


acquisition.


>> So
 in
 in
 the
 startup
 employee
 option


pool
 chart
 that
 that
 we
 just
 see
 here


here
 we
 see
 blue
 is
 deep
 tech
 and
 and


orange
 is
 software
 companies.
 What
 does


this
 chart
 tell
 us?


I
 was
 looking
 into
 this
 data
 the
 other


day
 and
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 questions


around
 startups
 is
 of
 course
 startups


cover
 a
 whole
 lot
 of
 different


industries.
 So
 you've
 got
 software


startups
 which
 is
 you
 know
 oftentimes


B2B
 SAS
 uh
 cursor
 is
 a
 fantastic
 example


of
 a
 software
 startup.
 They
 sell
 to


developers
 but
 all
 their
 product
 is
 is


digital
 code


>> whereas
 deep
 tech
 startups
 are
 often


building
 things
 in
 the
 physical
 world.


So
 robotics
 is
 deep
 tech,
 biotech,


actual
 new
 drugs
 is
 deep
 tech.
 Uh
 energy


nuclear
 reactors
 for
 instance,
 that


would
 be
 deep
 tech.
 So
 you're
 building


real
 physical
 things.
 And
 often
 times


what
 happens
 is
 that
 there's
 this
 idea


that
 building
 deep
 tech
 startups
 is


harder
 than
 building
 software
 ones


because
 you
 actually
 have
 to
 make
 stuff


in
 the
 real
 world.
 So,
 we
 were
 looking


at
 the
 option
 pools
 and
 you'd
 think,


okay,
 if
 a
 company
 if
 it's
 harder
 to


build
 a
 deep
 tech
 startup,
 then
 maybe


the
 option
 pools
 need
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


bigger
 because
 you're
 attracting
 much


more
 specialized
 talent.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like
 robotics
 engineers,


hardware
 engineers,


>> 100%.
 There's
 just
 fewer
 of
 them
 than


there
 are
 general
 software
 engineers.


>> And
 that's
 a
 that's
 kind
 of
 true
 at
 the


very
 beginning,
 but
 actually
 the
 data


shows
 that
 the
 option
 pool
 for
 deep
 tech


sort
 of
 levels
 out
 a
 little
 bit
 more


quickly
 than
 software.
 It's
 not
 gigantic


differences.
 They're
 they're
 pretty
 much


the
 same.
 Um,
 what
 I
 was
 interesting


about
 this
 is
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 stories


that
 people
 tell
 themselves
 about
 deep


tech
 startups
 that
 I
 think
 are
 starting


to
 not
 be
 quite
 as
 true.
 So
 things
 like


it
 always
 takes
 way
 more
 money
 to
 build


a
 deep
 tech
 startup.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 look


at
 OpenAI.
 That's
 a
 pretty
 moneyhungry


company
 that's
 building
 a
 note
 deep
 tech


product,
 right?
 they're
 building
 a


software
 product
 and
 they
 can
 gobble
 up


as
 much
 cash
 as
 humanly
 possible.
 So
 a


lot
 of
 times
 software
 companies
 can
 take


more
 capital
 than
 you
 think
 and


sometimes
 deep
 tech
 companies
 can
 take
 a


little
 bit
 less
 capital
 than
 you
 think.


So
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 cool
 investors


around
 deep
 tech
 right
 now
 that
 are


saying
 the
 best
 thing
 we
 can
 do
 for


startups
 is
 to
 fund
 more
 companies
 that


are
 building
 real
 physical
 things


instead
 of
 focusing
 quite
 as
 much
 on
 SAS


companies
 in
 general.


>> Yeah.
 Well
 hopefully
 we'll
 see
 more
 of


that.
 But
 it's
 interesting
 that
 I
 I


guess
 the
 option
 pool
 size
 doesn't


really
 meaningfully
 change.
 What
 about


advisory?
 I'm
 I'm
 really
 interested
 in


this
 because
 I've
 had
 experienced


software
 engineers
 who
 are
 either
 now


leads
 or
 engineering
 managers
 or
 you


know
 aspiring
 CTOs
 or
 even
 CTO's.


They're
 asking
 me
 how
 can
 I
 be
 an


adviser
 at
 a
 startup?
 I'm
 adviser
 at
 at


two
 two
 startups.
 Uh
 I
 I
 I
 get
 very
 very


small
 equity
 shares
 and
 I'm
 not
 as
 much


of
 an
 active
 adviser
 of
 myself.
 But
 uh


what
 does
 the
 data
 say
 about
 being
 an


adviser
 and
 also
 can
 you
 share
 some


anecdotes
 on
 how
 you've
 seen
 people
 from


software
 engineering
 background
 become


uh
 advisors
 or
 or
 how
 do
 you
 again
 I
 I


feel
 stories
 kind
 of
 help
 here
 you
 know


is
 it
 just
 knowing
 people
 is
 it
 hanging


out
 with
 them
 is
 it
 you
 know
 being
 an


expert
 and
 helping
 with
 them
 and
 so
 on


>> absolutely
 so
 uh
 let's
 start
 with
 the


data
 and
 then
 we'll
 go
 to
 some
 some


stories
 that
 I
 think
 will
 illustrate


what
 being
 an
 adviser
 is
 all
 out.
 So


advising
 a
 startup
 often
 times
 comes


along
 with
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 of


equity
 in
 that
 startup.
 Not
 always.


There
 are
 advisers
 that
 just
 work
 for


cash
 and
 that's
 totally
 fair.
 Um
 but


oftentimes
 you
 will
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of


equity
 if
 you
 become
 a
 startup
 adviser


and
 that's
 mostly
 because
 those
 startups


if
 they're
 very
 early
 don't
 have
 a
 lot


of
 cash.
 So
 they
 got
 to
 give
 you


something
 for
 your
 time.


>> Yep.
 Pretty
 much.


>> Um
 preede.
 So
 let's
 focus
 on
 that.
 That


is
 you
 haven't
 raised
 basically
 any


capital
 from
 VCs.
 You're
 a
 very
 young


startup.
 Maybe
 it's
 just
 even
 just
 the


founding
 team.
 Often
 times
 when
 I
 talk


to
 advisers,
 they
 say
 what
 we're
 looking


for
 is
 about
 1%
 of
 the
 business
 as
 the


equity
 package
 for
 advisers.
 That
 is


very
 high.
 That
 is
 on
 the
 very
 high.


That's
 nine
 out
 of
 10
 adviserss
 get


something
 less
 than
 1%.
 So
 1%
 is
 a
 very


big
 number.
 The
 median
 amount
 that
 is


granted
 to
 advisers
 across
 we
 had
 5,000


adviserss
 in
 this
 study
 in
 2024
 is


0.25%.


Um,
 so
 a
 quarter
 of
 1%.
 And
 that
 again,


if
 you're
 an
 adviser,
 you
 might
 be


sitting
 there
 going,
 "That
 doesn't
 sound


like
 very
 much.
 Why
 would
 I
 do
 the
 work


for
 that?"
 Well,
 let's
 put
 this
 in
 uh


context
 with
 how
 much
 employees
 are


given.
 So
 the
 first
 hire
 at
 a
 tech


startup
 these
 days,
 which
 is,
 by
 the


way,
 almost
 always
 an
 engineer.


>> Yeah.
 They're
 called
 founding
 engineers,


right?


>> Exactly.
 Founding
 engineers.
 They


typically
 receive
 on
 median
 1.5%
 of
 the


business.
 Sometimes
 as
 much
 as
 five,


sometimes
 as
 little
 as
 a
 half,
 but


generally
 1.5.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 be


working
 there
 full-time
 creating
 a
 lot


of
 the
 fundamental
 products
 that
 will


make
 or
 break
 the
 company.


>> They're
 a
 hugely
 important
 person.
 No


doubt.
 So
 in
 that
 context,
 an
 adviser


getting
 0.25%
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense


because
 the
 adviser
 is
 not
 working
 here


full-time.
 They
 are
 probably


contributing
 a
 handful
 of
 hours
 a
 month


or
 a
 quarter.
 So
 this
 makes
 more
 sense.


Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 stories
 around


adviserss.
 There
 are
 certain
 kinds
 of


adviserss
 that
 are
 worth
 tons
 of
 money


to
 startups.
 There
 are
 in
 my
 mind
 there


are
 two
 kinds.
 One
 is
 a
 technical


adviser.
 So
 I
 have
 a
 friend
 who
 used
 to


work
 at
 Uber
 and
 at


deep
 deep
 knowledge
 of
 how
 to
 run


marketplace
 matching
 algorithms.
 If
 you


are
 a
 startup
 in
 and
 you
 have
 to
 build


an
 algorithm
 that
 matches
 markets
 in
 a


dynamic
 real-time
 way,
 he
 is
 a
 world


expert
 at
 this
 thing.
 So
 you
 would
 have


access
 to
 someone
 who
 has
 actively
 built


this
 at
 scale
 for
 major
 major
 companies.


And
 so
 that
 might
 be
 worth
 more
 to
 you


than
 the
 average
 software
 engineer


adviser.


The
 other
 kind
 of
 adviser
 that
 is
 really


valuable
 to
 startups
 is
 someone
 who
 can


actually
 introduce
 you
 to
 customers.


So
 without
 them
 you
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to


talk
 to
 these
 businesses
 but
 with
 them


in
 in
 house
 you
 actually
 get
 meetings


with
 really
 big
 potential
 customers
 and


then
 hopefully
 you
 close
 come
 some
 of


those
 customers
 they
 are
 actively


bringing
 in
 revenue
 to
 the
 business.


Those
 are
 the
 two
 kinds
 of
 advisors
 like


very
 technical
 help
 or
 commercial
 help


that
 are
 most
 common
 in
 startups.
 the


adviser
 that
 sits
 down
 with
 you
 once
 a


month
 or
 once
 a
 quarter
 and
 goes
 over
 a


business
 plan
 or
 talks
 to
 you
 about
 your


marketing
 website,


I
 would
 generally
 say
 they're
 just
 not


worth
 nearly
 as
 much
 as
 some
 of
 them


think
 they
 are.


>> Jumping
 to
 to
 the
 life
 cycle
 of
 of


venture
 capital
 funded
 or
 VC
 funded


startups.
 I
 remember
 uh
 in
 2021
 when


again
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 I
 knew
 as


software
 engineers,
 they
 went
 and
 became


first-sand
 founders.
 uh
 they
 raised


their
 first
 seed
 round
 and
 they
 were


telling
 me
 like
 well
 you
 know
 the
 idea


is
 we
 need
 to
 sp
 we
 spend
 this
 money
 in


like
 18
 to
 24
 months
 and
 in
 18
 months


we'll
 raise
 a
 new
 round
 and
 that
 that


was
 the
 law
 like
 almost
 almost
 like


Moore's
 law
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 universal


law
 for
 about
 10
 years
 that
 if
 you
 if


you're
 a
 startup
 and
 you're
 doing
 well


in
 18
 months
 either
 you
 raise
 your
 new


round
 or
 you're
 going
 to
 die
 but
 this


data
 shows
 that
 something
 else
 is


happening
 what
 what
 is
 happening
 and


what
 what
 does
 this
 chart
 tell
 us


>> so
 this
 chart
 shows
 the
 median
 number
 of


days
 between
 these
 rounds.
 So
 from
 seed


to
 series
 A,
 from
 series
 A
 to
 series
 B,


etc.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 as
 you
 can
 see,
 the
 lines
 are
 just


getting
 higher
 and
 higher
 going
 up
 and


to
 the
 right,
 but
 not
 in
 a
 good
 way.


>> So
 it
 used
 to
 be
 that
 you
 would
 raise


perfect
 advice.
 You
 know,
 the
 18
 to


24month
 period
 was
 the
 median
 for
 a
 long


time,
 for
 many
 years.
 And
 now
 it
 might


be
 2
 and
 1/2
 years
 between
 seed
 and


series
 A.
 it
 might
 be
 almost
 three
 years


between
 series
 A
 and
 series
 B.
 So
 if


you're
 a
 founder,
 the
 clear
 takeaway


from
 this
 chart
 is
 you
 will
 probably


have
 to
 make
 the
 money
 you
 have
 today


last
 longer
 than
 you
 expected.


>> And
 I
 think
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 to
 leaner


teams
 or
 or
 or
 generating
 more
 revenue,


that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


>> 100%.
 You're
 going
 to
 change
 some
 way


about
 the
 way
 your
 business
 operates
 in


order
 to
 get
 over
 the
 fact
 that
 you're


probably
 not
 going
 to
 have
 as
 much
 cash


coming
 into
 the
 business
 from
 investors


as
 you
 expected.
 The
 other
 thing
 that's


happening
 though,
 and
 this
 is
 the
 sort


of
 good
 part
 of
 this
 chart,
 is
 some
 of


this
 is
 reflective
 of
 companies
 that


want
 to
 raise
 but
 can't
 raise.
 And
 some


of
 this
 is
 reflective
 of
 companies
 that


are
 just
 choosing
 not
 to
 raise
 because


they
 don't
 need
 to.


>> What
 we
 talked
 about
 in
 the
 beginning


that
 that's
 kind
 of
 a
 good
 thing


honestly,


>> 100%.
 So,
 and
 this
 is
 tricky
 for
 VCs
 as


well
 because
 VCs
 obviously
 want
 to
 put


more
 money
 into
 startups
 usually


>> in
 their
 best
 companies


>> into
 their
 best
 companies.
 and
 what
 if


the
 best
 companies
 go,
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 that
 initial
 capital,
 but
 we
 don't


we
 don't
 need
 anymore.
 You
 know,
 that's


it's
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 tricky
 moment
 for
 VCs,


too.
 So,
 everything
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 up


in
 the
 air
 in
 a
 way
 that
 it
 hasn't
 been


for
 a
 while.


>> And
 one
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 keep
 hearing
 is


how
 difficult
 it
 is
 to
 get
 to
 series
 A.


I've
 covered
 this
 in
 the
 newsletter


before
 because
 beforehand
 uh
 in
 2021
 and


2022
 uh
 getting
 to
 series
 8
 it
 almost


felt
 like
 like
 you
 previously
 said
 like


a a
 cay
 startup
 had
 an
 idea
 and
 they


kind
 of
 built
 a
 basic
 thing
 they
 got


some
 customers
 they
 got
 a
 million


dollars
 in
 revenue
 which
 I
 know
 sounds
 a


lot
 to
 some
 people
 but
 actually
 is
 if
 if


you're
 doing
 enterprise
 products
 you
 can


get
 it
 from
 a
 few
 deals
 who
 are
 maybe


not
 even
 fully
 committed
 and
 then
 a
 lot


of
 companies
 just
 raise
 a
 series
 A
 and
 I


was
 hearing
 people
 tell
 me
 at
 some
 point


that
 the
 series
 A
 became
 what
 what
 old


seed
 rounds
 used
 to
 be
 and
 you
 know


years
 before
 but
 now
 we're
 we're
 seeing


the
 opposite
 right
 we're
 seeing
 it's


really
 hard
 for
 companies
 to
 go
 from
 a


seed
 stage
 to
 a
 series
 A
 which
 is
 which


is
 your
 first
 bigger
 investment
 and
 that


shows
 that
 you're
 ready
 to
 scale
 it
 has


product
 market
 fit


>> exactly
 right
 the
 graduation
 rate
 is
 the


thing
 that
 we
 talk
 about
 a
 lot
 with


investors
 which
 is
 what
 percent
 of


seedstage
 startups
 ever
 raise
 a
 series
 A


and
 in
 the
 boom
 times
 in
 2021
 or
 So
 it


could
 be
 as
 high
 as
 half
 which
 is
 very


high
 right
 these
 are
 tricky
 risky


businesses
 the
 fact
 that
 half
 of
 them


were
 getting
 from
 seed
 to
 a
 probably


means
 that
 there
 was
 too
 much
 capital


available
 and
 it
 was
 too
 easy


>> yeah
 and
 I
 remember
 around
 that
 time


that
 this
 narrative
 that
 oh
 you
 should


join
 you
 just
 join
 a
 startup
 it's


actually
 not
 that
 high
 risk
 and
 you
 know


people
 are
 saying
 that
 it
 should
 be
 high


risk
 but
 it
 wasn't
 I
 didn't
 know
 many


people
 who
 you
 know
 got
 let
 go
 because


their
 startup
 went
 bankrupt
 it
 almost


felt
 that
 even
 if
 a
 startup
 is
 doing


poorly
 you'll
 be
 acquired
 by
 a
 bigger


startup
 or
 by
 a
 big
 tech
 that
 sort
 of


thing.


>> It
 was
 it
 was
 just
 a
 completely
 less


risky
 environment
 for
 sure.
 And
 now
 that


risk
 is
 definitely
 back.
 So
 on
 average
 I


would
 say
 that
 you
 should
 expect
 about


25
 maybe
 30%
 of
 startups
 that
 raise
 seed


rounds
 to
 end
 up
 raising
 a
 series
 A


round.
 So
 that
 means
 more
 than
 half
 of


them
 will
 not
 make
 it.
 And
 that's
 more


standard.
 That's
 after,
 you
 know,
 if
 you


had
 gone
 back
 to
 20
 2008,
 uh,
 2010,


etc.,
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 framework


that
 most
 people
 were
 working
 off
 of.


But
 again,
 that
 ZERP
 era,
 the
 zero


interest
 rates
 at
 2019,
 2020,
 early


2021,
 they
 just
 kind
 of
 boosted
 all
 of


these
 stats.
 So,
 if
 you're
 an
 engineer


thinking
 about
 joining
 a
 startup,
 that


startup
 raised
 the
 seed
 round
 four
 years


ago,
 the
 likelihood
 that
 they
 are
 ever


going
 to
 make
 it
 past
 seed
 is
 pretty


low.
 that
 this
 yeah
 this
 is
 really
 good


to
 just
 like
 get
 get
 a
 check
 and
 also
 I


guess
 if
 you're
 a
 company
 that
 just


raises
 seed
 rounder
 recently
 know
 that


you
 are
 in
 the
 top
 quarter
 quarter
 of


all
 companies
 and
 you
 know
 a
 bit
 of
 a


celebration
 might
 might
 be
 due
 I
 know


it's
 business
 as
 usual
 but
 maybe
 you


know
 like
 don't
 take
 it


>> for
 granted
 I
 think
 a
 night
 of
 champagne


is
 worthwhile
 right
 yeah
 totally
 and


then
 back
 to
 business


>> yeah
 and
 what
 what
 are
 we
 seeing
 for


startups
 being
 stuck
 in
 in
 in
 in
 certain


uh
 stages.


>> This
 is
 maybe
 a
 tricky
 topic
 that
 most


founders
 and
 VCs
 don't
 talk
 about
 that


much,
 but


>> we
 should
 talk
 about
 it.


>> We
 should
 talk
 about
 it
 more
 and
 I
 think


it's
 actually
 incumbent
 on
 the
 best


investors
 to
 have
 these
 hard


conversations.
 And
 here's
 what
 I'm


talking
 about.
 Uh
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


startups
 that
 raised
 a
 seed
 round
 in


2021
 or
 earlier
 that
 are
 still
 live


businesses
 but
 are
 basically
 just
 not


going
 anywhere.
 And
 the
 question
 really


becomes
 should
 those
 people
 shut
 the


business
 down
 or
 not?
 That's
 a
 really


difficult
 question.
 It's
 an
 emotional


question
 for
 a
 founder,
 no
 doubt.
 But


often
 times
 what
 happens
 I
 think
 we
 have


all
 of
 these
 stories
 around
 startups
 of


people
 who
 like
 Figma
 is
 a
 great
 example


where
 it
 said,
 "Oh,
 it
 took
 them
 four


years
 to
 build
 their
 initial
 product.


Everyone
 gave
 up
 on
 them
 and
 now
 look,


they're
 going
 to
 IPO
 this
 year
 and


they're
 such
 a
 success."


>> And
 I
 think
 there
 was
 also
 Slack
 which


like
 they
 almost
 ran
 out
 of
 money.
 They


tried
 out.
 But
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many


different
 things.


>> They
 were
 a
 gaming
 company
 first.


>> Yeah.
 They
 were
 gaming
 company,
 then


gaming
 chat,
 and
 then
 chat,
 and
 then


boom,
 you
 know,
 like
 look
 at
 them.
 They


were
 26
 billion
 or
 so
 when
 Salesforce


bought
 them.


>> Exactly.
 And
 that's
 the
 story
 that's


told
 around
 Silicon
 Valley,
 which
 is


never
 quit.
 Quitting
 is
 bad.
 Always
 keep


pivoting,
 always
 keep
 trying.
 And
 for


every
 single
 one
 of
 Slack
 or
 Figma
 as


examples,
 there
 are
 hundreds
 of


companies
 who
 did
 not
 make
 it.
 And
 so


really
 what
 this
 chart
 shows
 to
 me
 is


there's
 a
 founder
 talent
 example
 here


where
 it's
 like
 I
 want
 these
 talented


founders
 if
 they
 need
 to
 to
 shut
 their


businesses
 down
 and
 try
 the
 next
 idea.


And
 you
 know
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 we
 do


this
 weird
 thing
 where
 we
 praise
 never


quitting
 but
 we
 also
 are
 very
 excited
 by


failure.
 We
 say
 failure
 is
 good.
 Failure


is
 a
 great
 way
 to
 learn
 lessons.
 So
 both


of
 those
 things
 are
 kind
 of
 a
 little
 bit


in
 conflict
 with
 one
 another
 and
 I
 think


it
 shows
 very
 clearly
 in
 this
 data
 where


there
 are
 founders
 who
 raised
 a
 seed


round
 five
 years
 ago,
 six
 years
 ago


whose
 businesses
 probably
 aren't
 going


to
 go
 anywhere
 who
 are
 still
 chugging


along
 in
 that
 business.
 When
 we
 say
 they


probably
 won't
 go
 anywhere,
 that
 that


means
 that
 either
 making
 they're
 making


a
 sight
 loss
 or
 a
 small
 profit,
 but


they're
 not
 growing
 fast
 enough
 to
 raise


the
 next
 round
 to
 expand
 more
 to
 to
 you


know
 like
 to
 focus
 on
 growth
 which
 is


what
 VC
 should
 be
 about
 instead
 of
 being


a
 very
 stable
 business
 which
 let's
 say
 a


bootstrap
 company
 would
 be
 perfectly


happy
 with
 100%.
 And
 that
 gets
 back
 to


your
 ambition
 as
 a
 founder.
 If
 what
 you


want
 is
 to
 build
 a
 bootstrapped
 company


where
 you
 get
 to
 dictate
 how
 fast
 you


grow
 and
 you
 get
 to
 be
 as
 profitable
 as


you
 need
 to
 be
 along
 the
 way,
 amazing.


That
 is
 a
 fantastic
 way
 to
 build
 a


business.
 But
 if
 you
 take
 money
 from


VCs,
 you
 are
 committing
 to
 their
 growth


rates.


>> Yep.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 the
 tricky
 part
 and


I
 really
 hope
 that
 there
 are
 founders


out
 there
 who
 are
 sitting
 and
 wondering,


hey,
 what
 should
 I
 do
 with
 my
 company


who
 know
 that
 if
 they
 end
 up
 having
 to


shut
 down
 and
 return
 some
 capital
 to


investors,
 those
 investors
 are
 still


pretty
 likely
 if
 you
 did
 everything


above
 board
 to
 want
 to
 back
 your
 next


thing.
 Oftentimes,
 you
 know,
 there
 are


founders
 uh
 our
 our
 my
 CEO
 Henry
 is
 a


fantastic
 example.
 Carta
 is
 not
 Henry's


first
 business.
 Carta
 is
 Henry's
 second


business
 and
 the
 first
 one
 did
 not
 go


very
 well
 but
 he
 learned
 a
 ton
 of


lessons
 in
 it
 and
 that
 it
 kind
 of
 built


all
 this
 equity
 with
 investors
 so
 that


when
 he
 started
 Carta
 he
 had
 a
 much


better
 idea
 of
 what
 he
 was
 doing
 and
 I


think
 that
 that's
 true
 for
 a
 lot
 of


founders
 across
 VC.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 guess
 as
 an
 employee,
 this


is
 also
 a
 good
 reminder
 that
 you
 do
 want


to,
 for
 example,
 when
 you're
 looking
 for


a
 company,
 a
 VC
 funded
 company,
 look
 at


when
 they
 last
 raised
 money
 and
 know


that
 the
 longer
 it's
 been,
 the
 more


likely
 that
 the
 founder
 might
 say
 the


next
 day
 say,
 you
 know what,
 I'm
 going


to
 shut
 the
 company
 down
 because
 it's


not
 going
 anywhere.
 So
 like
 if
 you're


joining
 a
 company
 that
 last
 raised
 five


years
 ago
 and
 it's
 doesn't
 have
 that


amazing
 growth,
 it's
 it's
 probably
 more


risky
 than
 joining
 a
 bootstrap
 company


which
 again
 has
 a
 similar
 growth
 but


that
 one
 is
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 like
 again


these
 are
 all
 statistics,
 right?
 But


we're
 we're
 talking
 about
 data
 here.


>> Yep.
 Yep.
 No,
 you're
 totally
 right.
 I


mean
 ask
 questions
 as
 an
 engineer
 coming


into
 a
 startup
 company.
 Don't
 be
 afraid


to
 ask
 questions
 that
 matter,
 right?
 The


questions
 that
 matter
 might
 be
 how
 much


revenue
 does
 a
 business
 have?
 What
 sort


are
 the
 growth
 rates
 for
 the
 business?


How
 much
 capital
 did
 we
 take
 in
 and
 at


what
 terms?
 And
 how
 long
 has
 it
 been


since
 you
 fundraised?
 I
 think
 those
 are


very
 fair
 questions
 to
 be
 asking
 in
 an


interview.
 Now,
 it's
 not
 the
 case
 that


every
 HR
 person
 that
 you're
 interviewing


with
 will
 be
 able
 to
 tell
 you
 the


answers
 to
 those
 questions.
 Uh,
 depends


on
 the
 company,
 but
 they're
 totally
 fair


to
 ask.
 If
 I'm
 a
 software
 engineer
 or
 a


tech
 lead
 or
 an
 engineering
 leader,


how
 would
 you
 evaluate
 a
 VC
 funded


company
 to
 figure
 out
 is
 this
 a
 good


company
 to
 join
 at?
 Is
 it
 is
 is
 it


likely
 to
 be
 high
 growth?
 Could
 I
 have
 a


great
 career
 here
 where
 the
 team
 grows


and
 I
 get
 more
 and
 more
 responsibilities


and
 you
 know
 we'll
 take
 on
 more
 bigger


bigger
 challenges?


>> 100%.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 uh
 this
 is
 a


multi-variable
 question
 but
 I
 think
 the


framework
 and
 the
 mental
 model
 that
 you


should
 be
 using
 as
 an
 engineer
 joining


this
 company
 is
 the
 same
 as
 though
 you


were
 an
 investor.
 So
 put
 yourself
 in
 the


mind
 of
 a
 VC
 and
 say
 what
 do
 I
 think
 of


this
 company
 in
 in
 contra
 distinction
 to


all
 the
 other
 companies
 in
 their
 space.


How
 fast
 are
 they
 growing?
 Obviously


important.
 What
 is
 their
 unique


technological
 edge
 if
 there
 is
 one?
 So


this
 is
 something
 that
 VCs
 talk
 about
 a


lot,
 which
 is
 what
 is
 your
 moat?
 What
 is


your
 defensibility?
 Why
 in
 a
 world
 where


AI
 can
 spin
 up
 product
 features
 in
 a


weekend,
 why
 are
 you
 the
 company
 that's


going
 to
 win
 in
 this
 space?
 So
 if
 they


have
 a
 unique
 edge,
 and
 sometimes
 that


unique
 edge
 is
 very
 obvious.
 It's
 a


technical
 one.
 Sometimes
 it's
 this
 is


the
 most
 relentless
 founder
 I've
 ever


seen.
 Um
 both
 both
 are
 valid
 edges,
 by


the
 way.
 Like
 speed
 of
 execution
 is
 a


valid
 edge.
 Um
 but
 you
 want
 to
 have
 some


sense
 of
 what
 is
 the
 edge
 of
 this


company.
 And
 then
 when
 you
 get
 in
 to
 the


more
 like
 the
 deeper
 interview
 rounds,


etc.,
 you
 got
 to
 start
 back
 channeling


with
 people
 at
 the
 company,
 with
 people


who've
 worked
 with
 that
 founder
 before,


etc.
 If
 you're
 joining
 a
 seed
 or
 series


A
 firm,
 in
 many
 cases,
 what
 you're
 doing


is
 you're
 betting
 on
 that
 founder.


>> Y


>> So
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 you
 need
 to
 be


doing
 is
 being
 comfortable
 with
 the


founder
 themselves
 and
 saying,
 "This
 is


the
 kind
 of
 person
 that
 I
 want
 to
 follow


and
 I
 believe
 in
 strongly
 will
 have
 the


next
 great
 idea
 to
 keep
 us
 ahead
 of
 the


pack."
 So
 if
 it's
 an
 early
 early
 stage


place,
 you're
 betting
 on
 the
 founders


first
 and
 foremost.


>> As
 a
 software
 engineer
 or
 or
 engineing


leader,
 what
 do
 you
 think?
 What
 have
 you


seen
 skills
 being
 important
 to
 thrive
 at


a
 BC
 funded
 startup?


>> Obviously
 technical
 acumen
 matters
 no


matter
 where
 you
 are.
 So
 there's
 no


limit
 to
 how
 great
 an
 engineer
 you
 can


be
 on
 the
 technical
 skills.
 I
 think
 the


difference
 at
 a
 startup
 is
 there
 are


different
 personal
 skills
 that
 come
 into


play
 at
 startups
 versus
 big
 tech


companies.
 Um,
 for
 instance,
 at
 a


startup,
 you're
 very
 likely
 to
 have
 a


small
 or
 even
 non-existent
 team.
 So,


player
 coach
 comes
 into
 the
 idea
 here.


If
 you're
 joining
 as
 an
 engineering


leader
 at
 a
 fang
 company,
 you
 might
 have


13
 direct
 reports.
 At
 a
 startup,
 you


might
 have
 one.
 So,
 you're
 going
 to
 get


in
 the
 in
 the
 weeds
 and
 actually
 build


that
 code
 base
 a
 lot
 more
 in
 at
 a


startup.
 So,
 being
 willing
 to
 do
 that


and
 excited
 about
 it
 is
 is
 very


important.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 about


startups
 is
 it
 gets
 back
 to
 that
 idea


that
 there's
 a
 Swiss
 Army
 knife
 aspect


to
 it.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 asked
 to
 get


involved
 in
 stuff
 that
 is
 not
 just
 pure


code,
 right?
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 asked
 to


talk
 to
 a
 bunch
 of
 customers.
 You're


going
 to
 be
 asked
 to
 evaluate
 market


maps
 to
 say,
 "Oh,
 we're
 building
 this


product,
 but
 should
 we
 also
 try
 to
 build


this
 adjacent
 product
 or
 should
 we
 think


about
 buying
 a
 company
 that
 has
 an


adjacent
 product?
 How
 do
 these
 worlds


mix?"
 So,
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 pure
 technical


exercise.
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 start


upleveling
 your
 ideas
 about
 the


business.
 And
 that
 I
 think
 is
 the
 hidden


magic
 of
 startups
 where
 you
 would
 leave


a
 startup
 after
 2
 years
 and
 look
 back


and
 go,
 "Yeah,
 my
 coding
 skills
 got


better,
 but
 wow,
 I
 upleveled
 so
 much
 of


my
 knowledge
 on
 this
 space
 and
 the
 way


that
 businesses
 grow
 and
 shrink
 and


compete."
 Like
 that's
 the
 stuff
 that


really
 is
 exciting.


>> And
 this
 is
 what
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of


engineers
 these
 days
 who
 are
 who
 become


founders.
 They
 say,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 launching


my
 new
 startup.
 I
 raise
 this
 in
 this


much
 funding.
 Often
 times
 their
 engineer


number
 two,
 number
 two
 or
 number
 three


at
 this
 other
 startup
 was
 four
 years
 ago


which
 grew
 really
 fast.
 And
 actually


they're
 very
 open
 saying
 I've
 learned
 so


many
 of
 these
 skills.
 So
 now
 I'm


confident
 I'm
 doing
 my
 own
 thing
 which


is
 just
 amazing.


>> It's
 awesome.
 And
 it
 also
 makes
 it
 very


clear
 that
 doubling
 down
 on
 your
 network


is
 like
 something
 that
 is
 so
 important.


If
 you're
 at
 a
 fast
 grow
 like
 you
 at


Uber
 probably
 know
 a
 hundred
 people
 who


tried
 to
 start
 businesses
 after
 Uber


because
 they
 were
 just
 in
 such
 a
 deep


talent
 pool
 while
 they
 were
 there
 and


that
 that
 stuff
 really
 matters.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 one
 of the


reasons
 people
 underrate
 like
 it
 is


often
 times
 worth
 joining
 the
 most
 hyped


company
 around
 even
 if
 they
 might
 not


make
 it
 because
 they'll
 be
 such
 great


people
 and
 they'll
 go
 everywhere.
 If
 it


if
 if
 it
 works
 out
 people
 stay
 there


like
 at
 Facebook
 and
 they'll
 be
 amazing.


If
 not,
 they
 go
 elsewhere
 and
 they
 a


bunch
 of
 them
 will
 do
 amazing
 things
 and


the
 other
 ones
 will
 keep
 trying
 until
 do


they
 do
 something
 amazing.


>> There's
 a
 reason
 why
 there's
 these
 this


concept
 of
 Silicon
 Valley
 mafias,
 right?


The
 PayPal
 mafia,
 the
 Airbnb
 mafia,
 etc.


where
 people
 who
 work
 together
 at
 one


point
 end
 up
 their
 paths
 end
 up
 crossing


at
 totally
 different
 companies
 down
 the


road.
 Like
 that
 is
 super
 super
 common.


>> Let's
 close
 with
 some
 wrapped
 up


questions.
 Does
 that
 sound
 good?


>> Let's
 do
 it.


>> So,
 what
 are
 new
 sources
 that
 you
 use
 to


stay
 up
 to
 date
 with
 the
 VC
 industry?


podcasts
 are
 fantastic
 in
 this
 case.
 So,


some
 of
 the
 ones
 I'm
 listening
 to


lately,
 Sorcery
 from
 Molly
 O'Shea
 is
 is


wonderful.
 Uncapped
 by
 Jack
 Alman,
 Sam


Alman's
 brother,
 also
 founder
 of
 Lattis.


Wonderful
 podcast.
 Used
 to
 listen
 to


All-In,
 don't
 listen
 to
 it
 as
 much


anymore.
 Uh,
 sometimes
 you
 get
 tech


news,
 sometimes
 you
 get
 a
 ton
 of


politics.
 Depends
 on
 what
 you
 want.
 Um,


so
 that's
 one
 great
 news
 source.
 And
 of


course,
 Carta
 Data
 Minute,
 our
 our


podcast
 at
 Carta.
 The
 other
 I
 think
 that


tech
 press
 is
 sometimes
 a
 little
 bit


behind
 the
 times
 whereas
 tech


newsletters
 are
 oftentimes
 ahead
 of
 the


curve.
 So
 I
 mean
 obviously
 everyone's


probably
 already
 reading
 pragmatic


engineer
 but
 if
 they're
 not
 they
 should


and
 then
 the
 other
 one
 that
 is
 tech
 but


startups
 but
 everything
 I
 mean
 if
 you


don't
 read
 Ben
 Thompson
 like
 you're
 just


out
 of
 the
 loop.
 Strateery
 is
 like
 a


must-have
 I
 would
 say.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 for
 anyone
 wanting
 to


build
 up
 their
 business
 muscle,
 it's


it's
 amazing.
 I
 have
 to
 like
 plus
 one


that
 one.


>> Absolutely.


>> What
 is
 what
 is
 it
 what
 is
 a
 tool
 that


you
 use
 and
 you
 love
 and
 why?
 And
 it
 can


be
 a
 digital
 or
 a
 physical
 tool
 as
 well.


>> I
 love
 Tableau.
 Uh
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of


people
 don't
 like
 it.
 I
 know
 it's
 an
 old


an
 older
 older
 tool
 for
 everyone.
 It's
 a


vintage
 tool.
 But
 like
 as
 someone
 who


thinks
 in
 terms
 of
 charts
 and
 graphs,
 I


have
 lived
 in
 Tableau
 for
 quite
 a
 while


and
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 the
 most
 uh


wonderful
 way
 to
 get
 visual
 diversity
 in


your
 charts.
 So
 I'm
 triing
 all
 sorts
 of


different
 chart
 makers,
 AI
 ones,
 etc.


all
 the
 time
 and
 I
 just
 keep
 coming
 back


to
 Tableau.
 So
 uh
 I
 can't
 quit
 it
 yet


even
 though
 some
 people
 might
 might


disagree.


>> What
 what
 is
 a
 book
 that
 you
 you'd


recommend
 and
 why?


>> I
 am
 reading
 a
 book
 right
 now
 which
 I


think
 is
 fascinating.
 Apple
 in
 China


very
 recently
 published.
 Candidly,
 if


you're
 an
 Apple
 fan,
 it
 kind
 of
 makes


you
 feel
 uh
 not
 so
 good.
 You
 you
 get


this
 huge
 history
 of
 how
 Apple
 came
 to


be
 so
 deeply
 embedded
 in
 China
 for
 the


manufacturing
 of
 all
 their
 products
 and


what
 that
 means
 for
 the
 world,
 for


global
 trade,
 for
 the
 competition


between
 these
 two
 countries.
 I
 think


it's
 a
 wonderful
 book
 that
 is
 company


focused
 but
 it
 gives
 you
 this
 lens
 on


how
 to
 look
 at
 the
 way
 that
 the
 world


has
 changed
 over
 the
 last
 call
 it
 10
 or


15
 years.
 So
 uh
 really
 really
 have
 loved


it.


>> I
 think
 Ben
 Thompson
 called
 it
 the
 best


book
 on
 Apple
 and
 the
 best
 book
 on
 China


recently


>> which
 is
 pretty
 hard
 to
 do.
 That's
 those


are
 two
 big
 areas.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 Peter,
 this
 was
 really


interesting,
 really
 refreshing,
 and
 I


think
 much
 needed
 in
 and
 as
 as
 a


software
 engineer
 to
 think
 a
 little
 bit


more
 about
 how
 VC
 operates,
 what
 it


means,
 and
 and
 just
 the
 reality
 of


working
 at
 VCR
 and
 how
 it
 keeps
 changing


and
 how
 the
 bar
 just
 keeps
 going
 higher.


>> Yeah,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me,


man.
 This
 is
 uh
 this
 is
 fantastic,
 and


I'm
 excited
 to
 watch
 what
 engineers
 who


listen
 to
 this
 show
 build
 as
 they
 become


founders
 over
 the
 next
 couple
 years.
 I


hope
 you
 enjoyed
 this
 very
 datadriven


episode
 where
 we
 went
 through
 a
 large


number
 of
 data
 points
 and
 charts
 to
 get


a
 sense
 of
 how
 VC
 funding
 and
 VC
 funded


startups
 are
 doing.
