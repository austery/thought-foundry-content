It's
 September
 2000.
 Two
 men,
 Reed


Hastings
 and
 Mark
 Randolph,
 fly
 to


Dallas
 to
 meet
 Blogbuster,
 the
 king
 of


the
 movie
 world
 at
 the
 time.
 They
 offer


Blockbuster
 to
 buy
 their
 struggling


startup
 called
 Netflix.


At
 first,
 the
 CEO
 stays
 silent
 and
 then


calls
 Netflix
 a
 niche
 business
 that


would
 never
 last.
 Fast
 forward
 to
 today.


That
 so-called
 niche
 business
 is
 just


about
 to
 swallow
 Warner
 Brothers,
 the


beast
 behind
 Harry
 Potter,
 DC,
 and
 HBO.


Not
 only
 did
 the
 underdog
 survive,
 it


took
 Hollywood
 and
 the
 entire
 movie


industry
 by
 storm.
 So
 much
 so
 that


Netflix
 and
 Hollywood
 are
 synonymous


these
 days.
 Happy
 New
 Year,
 ladies
 and


gentlemen.
 We're
 starting
 2026
 with
 the


biggest
 deal
 in
 the
 history
 of
 media.
 I


will
 cover
 the
 math
 that
 makes
 Netflix


untouchable,
 the
 culture
 clash
 between


data
 and
 artistry,
 and
 what
 the
 Netflix


Warner
 Brothers
 acquisition
 means
 for


the
 movie
 industry
 and
 entertainment
 as


a
 whole.
 Let's
 dive
 in.


A
 quick
 timeline,
 October
 2025,
 Warner


Brothers
 Discovery
 is
 putting
 the


company
 up
 for
 sale.
 The
 reason,


catastrophic
 debts,
 around
 $43
 billion.


On
 December
 5,
 Netflix
 announces
 that
 it


would
 buy
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery
 for


$82
 billion,
 marking
 the
 largest
 media


transaction
 in
 history.
 Now,
 when
 we
 say


acquisition,
 what
 exactly
 is
 being


acquired?
 Warner
 Brothers
 is
 a


conglomerate,
 as
 you
 know,
 and
 they
 have


two
 branches
 so
 to
 say,
 of
 business.
 One


is
 entertainment,
 and
 the
 other
 one
 is


information
 services.
 Entertainment


includes
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery,
 HBO


Max,
 DC
 franchises
 like
 Batman
 or


Superman,
 and
 of
 course,
 Harry
 Potter.


And
 then
 there
 are
 cable
 networks,
 their


gaming
 division,
 and
 sports
 channels.


The
 Netflix
 deal
 only
 covers


entertainment
 services,
 which
 means
 that


if
 it
 really
 happens,
 Netflix
 will
 get


access
 to
 all
 of
 HBO's
 content,
 DC,


Harry
 Potter,
 and
 Warner
 Brothers


content
 library.
 But
 this
 acquisition
 is


yet
 to
 be
 approved
 by
 antirust


regulators
 and
 there's
 absolutely
 no


guarantee
 that
 this
 will
 happen.
 But
 if


it
 does,
 when
 are
 we
 going
 to
 see
 the


result?
 The
 deal
 is
 in
 the
 review
 phase.


It
 hasn't
 closed
 and
 it
 is
 with
 both
 the


Department
 of
 Justice
 Antirust
 Division


and
 potentially
 the
 Federal
 Trade


Commission.
 Put
 a
 pin
 in
 this.
 I
 will


come
 back
 to
 it.
 The
 closing
 is
 expected


to
 take
 place
 in
 the
 second
 half
 of
 2026


at
 the
 earliest,
 potentially
 extending


into
 next
 year.
 It
 is
 worth
 mentioning


that
 Netflix
 wasn't
 the
 only
 buyer
 that


expressed
 interest.
 Paramount
 also


fought
 for
 it
 for
 months,
 but
 Warner


Brothers
 ended
 up
 turning
 down
 the
 $108


billion
 deal
 offered
 by
 Paramount,
 which


let
 me
 emphasize
 is
 a
 larger
 offer
 than


what
 they
 got
 offered
 by
 Netflix.
 The


reason
 for
 that
 is
 because
 they
 said


that
 they
 specifically
 wanted
 Netflix.


The
 offer
 from
 Paramount
 stood
 until


January
 8th,
 which
 is
 a
 couple
 of
 days


ago,
 but
 as
 of
 today,
 Warner
 Brothers


has
 officially
 rejected
 Paramount's


higher
 bid.
 So,
 why
 does
 Netflix
 need


Warner
 Brothers?


Remember
 last
 time
 we
 told
 you
 about


what
 it's
 like
 to
 run
 a
 YouTube
 channel


and
 what
 happens
 behind
 the
 scenes?


Yeah.
 The
 only
 thing
 I
 didn't
 tell
 you


about
 is
 what
 it's
 like
 to
 run
 a


production
 team.
 from
 scripting,


storyboarding,
 shot
 planning,
 camera


angles,
 set
 design,
 props,
 and
 a
 million


other
 things.
 So,
 we
 need
 a
 video


production
 software,
 but
 the
 one
 that


would
 work
 specifically
 for
 YouTube,


specifically
 for
 our
 team
 size,
 our


channel
 theme,
 our
 scaling
 plans,
 and
 be


affordable.
 So,
 yes,
 I'm
 asking
 for


something
 extremely
 customized.
 But
 what


if
 I
 built
 something
 entirely
 custom
 and


tailored
 exactly
 to
 my
 business?
 That
 is


exactly
 what
 Rebolt
 came
 to
 fix.
 Rebolt


is
 a
 noode
 platform
 that
 lets
 anyone


build
 custom
 tools
 and
 AI
 agents
 for


businesses,
 businesses
 of
 any
 kind,


large
 or
 small,
 in
 plain
 English.
 Once


again,
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 VIP
 coding
 app.


You
 can
 build
 an
 entire
 software
 system


designed
 for
 your
 specific
 business


regardless
 of
 the
 size.
 For
 example,


build
 a
 video
 production
 database
 for
 a


creative
 team
 that
 syncs
 shoots,
 video


scripts,
 and
 collaborations
 from
 Gmail,


stores
 lists
 of
 shots
 and
 B-roll
 in


Notion,
 and
 classify
 scenes
 and
 footage


from
 OpenAI.
 And
 with
 a
 couple
 more


tweaks,
 I
 have
 a
 custom
 video
 production


system
 built
 specifically
 for
 our
 team,


our
 channel,
 and
 our
 resources.
 The


database
 automatically
 links
 all
 of
 our


shoots.
 Each
 video
 has
 assigned
 people,


software,
 credits,
 and
 agenda.
 And
 when


footage
 is
 uploaded,
 Rebel's
 AI
 agents


classify
 everything
 automatically
 and


assign
 to
 a
 video
 editor.
 If
 you
 want
 to


stop
 duct
 taping
 a
 ton
 of
 software
 that


doesn't
 quite
 work
 for
 you
 and
 your


business,

 Rebolt.
 There
 is
 a


link
 below.
 Huge
 thanks
 to
 Rebolt
 for


sponsoring
 this
 part
 of
 the
 video.


Streaming
 services
 is
 a
 very
 mature


industry.
 If
 I
 ask
 you
 to
 name
 top
 three


streaming
 services,
 you
 would
 probably


say
 YouTube,
 Netflix,
 and
 Amazon
 video.


And
 there's
 something
 very
 specific
 that


happens
 to
 companies
 when
 they're
 past


the
 phase
 of
 scaling.
 When
 you
 are
 a


mature,
 well-known
 player
 in
 a
 mature


field,
 much
 like
 David
 Beckham
 in


football,
 revenue
 and
 profits
 matter


more
 than
 subscriber
 count.
 After
 years


of
 working
 in
 tech
 industry,
 there
 have


been
 numerous
 times
 when
 I
 was
 asked
 a


very
 typical
 question
 during
 a
 job


interview.
 And
 the
 question
 goes
 like


come
 up
 with
 a
 new
 product
 for
 YouTube


or
 come
 up
 with
 a
 new
 product
 or
 a
 new


service
 for
 Netflix.
 And
 if
 you
 go


through
 any
 interview
 prep
 for
 these


types
 of
 questions,
 the
 first
 thing
 that


you're
 going
 to
 see
 is
 that
 you
 have
 to


consider
 market
 maturity.
 And
 Netflix
 is


a
 textbook
 case.
 Netflix
 is
 a
 beast.
 It


is
 very
 mature,
 very
 established,
 and


every
 incremental
 improvement
 takes


disproportionate
 amount
 of
 money
 and


time.
 They're
 simply
 too
 big.


Acquisition
 of
 Warner
 Brothers
 gives


them
 128
 million
 subscribers
 technically


overnight,
 plus
 expansion
 into


international
 markets.
 And
 most


importantly,
 it
 saves
 them
 years
 of


incremental
 gains.
 So
 for
 Netflix,
 it


makes
 sense.
 But
 what's
 in
 it
 for
 Warner


Brothers?
 To
 explain
 the
 reason
 Warner


Brothers
 got
 such
 a
 massive
 debt
 and


ended
 up
 in
 a
 position
 where
 they
 sought


a
 buyer,
 we
 have
 to
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and


recall
 the
 company
 that
 has
 seemingly


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the
 movie
 industry.


AT&T.
 In
 2018,
 AT&T
 acquired
 Time


Warner,
 which
 owned
 Warner
 Brothers,


HBO,
 and
 CNN
 at
 the
 time.
 The
 only


problem,
 AT&T
 is
 not
 an
 entertainment


production
 business
 and
 the
 corporate


cultures
 of
 a
 regulated
 nationwide


telecommunications
 monopoly
 and
 a


creative
 entertainment
 company
 collided.


Within
 just
 3
 years,
 it
 all
 went


downhill
 and
 they
 ended
 up
 with
 lots
 of


debt.
 For
 people
 inside
 Warner,
 editors,


screenwriters,
 camera
 crews,
 it
 meant


layoffs,
 hiring
 freezes,
 and
 cancel


projects.
 As
 one
 analyst
 summarized,


AT&T
 managed
 to
 turn
 a
 $150
 billion


company
 into
 a
 company
 they
 sold
 for
 $50


billion
 in
 debt
 a
 mere
 three
 years


later.
 So
 for
 Warner
 Brothers,
 the


reason
 is
 very
 simple.
 Unsustainable


debts.
 But
 even
 if
 the
 math
 makes
 sense


for
 the
 business,
 there
 is
 one
 group
 of


people
 who
 can
 kill
 this
 deal
 with
 a


single
 penstroke.
 Let's
 come
 back
 to
 our


pin.
 Department
 of
 Justice
 Antirust


Division.


What
 do
 you
 think
 is
 the
 most


consequential
 decision
 that
 the


Department
 of
 Justice
 is
 going
 to
 make?


The
 market.
 The
 decision
 which
 market


they're
 analyzing.
 This
 is
 the
 single


most
 important
 thing
 that
 the
 court
 has


to
 decide
 before
 any
 other
 analysis


occurs.
 The
 definition
 of
 the
 market.


And
 how
 do
 you
 define
 a
 market
 that


Netflix
 is
 in?
 They
 can
 go
 broadly
 and


consider
 entertainment
 as
 a
 whole.
 If


it's
 entertainment
 as
 a
 whole,
 what
 is


meant
 by
 entertainment?
 Are
 we
 talking


cable,
 TV,
 YouTube,
 media,
 social
 media,


streaming?
 If
 yes,
 the
 acquisition
 does


not
 raise
 a
 risk
 of
 monopoly
 because


there
 is
 a
 ton
 of
 players
 on
 the
 market.


But
 if
 the
 market
 is
 defined
 narrowly,


for
 example,
 subscription
 streaming


only,
 the
 acquisition
 can
 be
 deemed


illegal.
 Why?
 because
 the
 combined


market
 of
 Warner
 Brothers
 and
 Netflix


reaches
 45%
 and
 it
 becomes
 a
 monopoly


risk
 and
 in
 that
 case
 it
 is
 a
 threat
 to


the
 market.
 You
 may
 ask
 isn't
 Netflix


already
 a
 monopoly?
 Yes,
 in
 theory
 but


in
 practice
 Netflix
 does
 not
 have


monopoly
 level
 power.
 Netflix
 still


loses
 customers
 when
 it
 raises
 prices.


Every
 price
 increase
 triggers
 measurable


churn,
 which
 means
 that
 users
 have


alternatives
 and
 can
 walk
 away.
 When


they
 rose
 prices
 in
 the
 past,
 thousands


of
 subscribers
 cancelled
 in
 a
 short


period
 of
 time,
 which
 proves
 that


Netflix
 cannot
 set
 prices
 without
 any


consequences.
 Their
 prices
 are


localized.
 Plans
 in
 India
 are
 70%


cheaper
 than
 those
 in
 the
 US
 because


consumers
 in
 India
 will
 not
 pay
 American


rates.
 And
 lastly,
 Netflix
 launched
 a


lowerc
 cost
 plan
 with
 ads
 to
 keep
 or
 win


back
 price
 sensitive
 consumers
 instead


of
 simply
 pushing
 everybody
 into
 the


high
 price
 plan.
 But
 legal


technicalities
 aside,
 there
 is
 a
 reason


Netflix
 is
 the
 one
 buying
 and
 not
 the


one
 being
 sold.
 To
 understand
 why,
 we


have
 to
 look
 at
 the
 economics
 of
 how


they
 actually
 make
 and
 spend
 their


money.
 But
 as
 we're
 about
 to
 see,
 that


level
 of
 efficiency
 comes
 with
 a
 very


specific
 and
 very
 controversial


trade-off.
 Let's
 look
 at
 the
 math.
 The


economics
 of
 Netflix.


Long
 gone
 are
 the
 days
 when
 Netflix
 was


just
 a
 content
 aggregator.
 They
 became


an
 industrydefining
 content
 producer.


The
 Crown,
 Squid
 Game,
 The
 Queen's


Gambit,
 Beef,
 and
 so
 many
 more.
 10
 years


ago,
 they
 were
 pioneers.
 They
 were
 bold.


They
 created
 revolutionary
 shows
 like


Black
 Mirror
 and
 subsequently
 Bander


Snatch.
 For
 those
 of
 you
 who
 might
 have


missed
 Banner
 Snatch,
 it
 is
 a
 show
 where


you
 have
 the
 power
 to
 make
 a
 decision
 to


change
 the
 plot.
 Every
 time
 a
 character


has
 to
 make
 an
 important
 decision,


you're
 the
 one
 who
 chooses
 what
 they
 do.


Narcos,
 Adolescence,
 Stranger
 Things,


The
 End
 of
 the
 World,
 my
 absolute


favorite.
 But
 as
 time
 goes
 on,
 we're


seeing
 fewer
 of
 these.
 Yes,
 all
 of
 these


are
 Netflix
 originals,
 and
 these
 shows


gave
 us
 lots
 of
 reasons
 to
 get
 together


with
 friends
 and
 family,
 drop
 everything


you
 had
 to
 do,
 and
 binge
 watch
 a
 show
 on


the
 weekend
 or
 holiday
 season.
 But


again,
 unfortunately,
 scale
 comes
 at
 a


cost.
 The
 bulk
 of
 Netflix's
 original


content
 has
 been
 consistently
 mediocre,


and
 the
 data
 proves
 it.
 There
 is
 a


general
 sense
 of
 deteriorating
 quality,


and
 Reddit
 has
 numerous
 threads
 on
 this,


but
 the
 business,
 the
 business
 is


flourishing.
 Listen
 closely,
 the
 math
 is


wild.
 Netflix's
 content
 budget
 for
 2025


was
 projected
 at
 $18
 billion.
 And
 even


though
 it's
 been
 rising
 for
 years,
 their


CFO
 stated
 that
 they're
 nowhere
 near
 a


ceiling
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 content


spending.
 You
 may
 ask,
 is
 $18
 billion
 a


lot?
 In
 the
 grand
 scheme
 of
 things,
 not


really.
 To
 put
 this
 in
 perspective,


here's
 how
 much
 Netflix's
 competitors


spend.
 Disney
 $30
 billion
 across
 all


divisions.
 Warner
 Brothers
 Discovery


19.5
 billion.
 Paramount
 15
 billion.
 The


peak
 year
 for
 Netflix
 in
 the
 context
 of


quality
 was
 2019
 with
 further
 decline.


Their
 average
 rating
 on
 Netflix
 original


movies
 is
 between
 five
 and
 six
 across


all
 years
 regardless
 of
 whether
 they


release
 three
 or
 300
 films
 per
 year.


Nevertheless,
 audience
 growth
 350%


since
 2015,
 300
 million
 paid
 users,
 low


churn,
 high
 comeback
 ratio
 after
 churn,


and
 subscription
 price
 went
 up
 65%
 since


2018.
 What
 this
 means
 is
 that
 Netflix's


unit
 economics
 are
 highly
 efficient,


which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 makes


them
 highly
 attractive
 for
 an


acquisition
 or
 a
 merger.
 So,
 say
 what


you
 will
 about
 the
 quality,
 but
 the


reality
 is
 they're
 so
 mature
 now
 that


they
 can
 afford
 to
 be
 mediocre
 and
 still


dominate
 the
 market.
 Netflix
 is
 the
 Zara


of
 streaming
 services,
 and
 I
 mean
 it
 as


a
 praise.
 Zara
 is
 a
 phenomenal
 brand.


They
 made
 unachievable
 for
 many
 runway


fashion
 available
 to
 a
 midlevel
 pocket


budget.
 And
 we
 like
 Zara
 for
 what
 it
 is.


Would
 you
 go
 there
 to
 buy
 a
 suit
 for
 a


gala?
 Probably
 not.
 But
 would
 you
 go


there
 for
 a
 pair
 of
 jeans
 for
 everyday?


Absolutely.
 So
 Netflix,
 just
 like
 Zara,


brings
 all
 sorts
 of
 content
 for
 all


kinds
 of
 viewers
 with
 all
 kinds
 of


tastes
 and
 viewing
 habits
 at
 an


accessible
 price.
 And
 yes,
 sometimes


it's
 Squid
 Game
 and
 sometimes
 it's
 a
 $10


shirt
 that
 falls
 apart
 after
 three


washes.
 Nevertheless,
 a
 very
 strong


business.
 What
 does
 this
 acquisition


mean
 for
 the
 streaming
 industry?
 There


are
 three
 possible
 outcomes
 we
 might


witness.
 Outcome
 one,
 deal
 blocked
 by


regulators.
 If
 the
 Department
 of
 Justice


defines
 the
 market
 narrowly
 as


subscription
 streaming
 only,
 the
 deal


dies.
 Outcome
 two,
 deal
 approved.
 HBO


culture
 is
 preserved.
 This
 is
 the
 best


case
 scenario
 where
 we
 get
 Netflix's


scale
 and
 HBO's
 artistry.
 Outcome
 three,


deal
 approved,
 HBO
 absorbed,
 including


culture
 shift.
 Netflix
 applies
 its


completion
 rate
 metrics
 to
 HBO
 content


decisions.
 A
 few
 words
 on
 why
 this
 is


important
 and
 why
 the
 absorbance
 of
 HBO


culture
 is
 the
 biggest
 concern
 around


this
 acquisition.
 Product
 culture
 is
 the


pulse
 of
 a
 tech
 company.
 Typically,
 the


way
 one
 describes
 a
 service
 or
 a
 product


is
 the
 litmus
 test
 of
 the
 product


culture
 within
 that
 business.
 Netflix


aims
 for
 each
 viewer
 to
 complete
 the


series
 they
 started.
 They
 don't


necessarily
 care
 about
 the
 absolute


numbers
 of
 people
 who
 watch
 the
 show.


They
 care
 that
 you
 finish
 the
 show
 that


you
 started.
 What
 matters
 to
 them
 is


that
 if
 you
 start,
 you
 have
 to
 finish.


Netflix
 has
 a
 strict
 rule.
 If
 fewer
 than


50%
 of
 viewers
 who
 started
 the
 show


finish
 the
 season,
 the
 show
 gets


cancelled.
 This
 is
 the
 very
 foundation


of
 Netflix's
 renewal
 decisions
 for
 any


show.
 First
 Kill,
 97
 million
 hours


watched
 in
 the
 first
 month,
 cancelled.


Completion
 rate,
 44%.


1899,
 critically
 acclaimed
 German


sci-fi,
 cancelled
 after
 one
 season,


completion
 rate
 32%.
 Shadow
 and
 Bone,


most
 watched
 cancelled
 show
 of
 the
 first


half
 of
 2023.
 cancelled
 because
 it
 did


not
 reach
 Netflix's
 efficiency
 baseline,


but
 shows
 with
 50%
 completion
 rate
 get


renewed
 regardless
 of
 total
 viewing


numbers.
 Heartstoppper,
 which
 I
 loved,


by
 the
 way,
 53
 million
 hours
 watched,


that
 is
 50%
 watch
 time
 compared
 to
 the


first
 skill
 yet
 renewed
 for
 multiple


seasons.
 Completion
 rate
 73%.


Arcane
 60%
 completion
 rate
 renewed


despite
 niche
 audience,
 but
 shows
 with


50%
 completion
 rate
 get
 renewed


regardless
 of
 the
 total
 viewing
 numbers.


What
 this
 means
 is
 that
 the
 product


culture
 at
 Netflix
 revolves
 around


completion
 rates.
 Once
 again,
 Netflix


cares
 less
 about
 how
 many
 people
 watch


and
 more
 about
 whether
 those
 who
 start


finish.
 HBO's
 product
 culture,
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 can
 be
 expressed
 in
 one


sentence.
 It's
 not
 TV,
 it's
 HBO.
 HBO's


mission
 for
 years
 has
 been
 to
 give


artists
 resources
 and
 time
 and
 then
 get


out
 of
 their
 way.
 For
 example,
 The


Sopranos,
 a
 critically
 acclaimed


prestige
 show
 with
 psychological


complexity
 and
 plot
 efficiency.
 The


Wire,
 notoriously
 slow
 paced
 for
 a


season
 that
 would
 never
 survive


Netflix's
 completion
 rate,
 became
 the


most
 critically
 acclaimed
 show
 in


television
 history.
 HBO
 is
 known
 for
 its


signature
 style,
 which
 differs


dramatically
 from
 Netflix's.
 HBO
 built


its
 reputation
 on
 slow
 burns,


challenging
 and
 complex
 narratives,
 and


very
 specific
 artistic
 vision.
 But
 the


reason
 I'm
 against
 black
 and
 white


division
 between
 bad
 Netflix
 and
 good


HBO
 is
 because
 if
 you
 remove
 the
 bias


out
 of
 this
 equation
 and
 compare
 the


recognitions,
 you
 will
 see
 that
 they're


pretty
 much
 on
 par.
 Since
 2016,
 HBO
 and


HBO
 Max
 produced
 34
 prestige
 TV
 shows


with
 Metacritic
 rating
 74
 plus.
 Netflix


produced
 33
 in
 the
 same
 time
 period.
 HBO


got
 130
 Emmy
 nominations,
 19
 wins
 as
 of


2022.
 Netflix


129
 nominations
 with
 44
 wins.
 This
 is


why
 I'm
 saying
 that
 it's
 not
 that
 one
 is


better
 than
 the
 other.
 It's
 about


completely
 opposite
 product
 cultures.
 If


Netflix
 is
 Zara,
 HBO
 is
 a
 limited


edition
 Hermes.
 Both
 have
 their
 markets.


Both
 have
 their
 audiences.
 Is
 there
 an


overlap
 between
 those
 audiences?
 Yes,
 to


an
 extent,
 but
 would
 you
 get
 concerns
 if


Zara
 were
 to
 acquire
 Hermes?
 Yes,
 you


would.
 Understandingly
 so.
 The


acquisition
 is
 potentially
 the
 decisive


moment
 for
 streaming
 wars.
 For
 nine


years
 in
 a
 row,
 Netflix
 was
 basically


uncontested
 as
 a
 content
 aggregator.
 It


licensed
 content
 from
 studios
 who
 did


not
 view
 Netflix
 and
 streaming
 as
 a


whole
 as
 a
 threat.
 They
 built
 subscriber


base
 of
 a
 100
 million
 users
 without


meaningful
 competition.
 And
 studios
 were


happy
 to
 license
 content
 to
 them
 because


it
 was
 easy
 money.
 And
 all
 of
 it
 was


fine
 and
 dandy
 until
 2019
 when
 the
 TV


and
 movie
 industry
 were
 like,
 why
 don't


we
 all
 launch
 streaming
 services
 and


that's
 when
 the
 streaming
 wars
 began


when
 every
 major
 media
 company
 launched


their
 own
 streaming
 service.
 Disney


Plus,
 HBO
 Max,
 Paramount
 Plus,
 Amazon


Video,
 Disney,
 NBS,
 Warner
 Brothers,
 all


of
 them
 stopped
 licensing
 their
 content


to
 Netflix.
 Netflix
 was
 undercut
 on


pricing
 because
 the
 new
 services
 were


coming
 at
 $7
 to
 $10
 per
 month
 versus


Netflix's
 16.
 And
 on
 top
 of
 it,
 every


platform
 began
 its
 in-house
 production


to
 spin
 out
 original
 content.
 By
 2022,


the
 streaming
 bubble
 started
 deflating


and
 the
 hype
 began
 to
 wear
 off.
 It


became
 obvious
 that
 math
 ain't
 mathing.


In-house
 production
 was
 not
 paying
 off,


and
 many
 of
 the
 streaming
 services
 that


launched
 simply
 weren't
 profitable.
 And


this
 is
 where
 Netflix's
 math
 becomes


unbeatable.
 Content
 costs
 don't
 scale


linearly.
 Netflix
 spends
 $18
 billion


serving
 310
 million
 subscribers.
 That
 is


$58
 per
 subscriber
 annually.
 Warner


Brothers
 Discovery
 spent
 19
 and
 a
 half


billion
 serving
 128
 million
 subscribers.


That's
 152
 per
 subscriber.
 You
 simply


cannot
 spend
 your
 way
 to
 Netflix's


efficiency
 without
 Netflix's
 scale.


There
 is
 a
 threshold
 in
 streaming


economics
 where
 you
 need
 about
 250


million
 subs
 minimum
 to
 achieve


profitability.
 Why?
 Because
 a
 prestige


TV
 series
 costs
 between
 $100
 and
 $200


million
 per
 season.
 Examples,
 House
 of


Dragon,
 Stranger
 Things.
 If
 you
 have
 50


million
 subscribers,
 that
 is
 $2
 to4
 per


subscriber
 per
 show.
 If
 you
 have
 300


million
 subscribers,
 that
 is
 less
 than
 a


dollar
 per
 subscriber
 per
 show.
 At
 50
 to


100
 million
 subs,
 you
 can
 afford
 about


10
 to
 20
 prestige
 shows
 annually
 before


unit
 economics
 break.
 At
 300
 million


subscribers,
 you
 can
 afford
 50
 to
 100


prestige
 shows
 while
 maintaining
 unit


economics.
 The
 reason
 why
 streaming
 wars


may
 end
 after
 this
 acquisition
 is


because
 once
 Netflix
 reaches
 more
 than


400
 million
 subscribers
 with
 HBO's
 Max's


library,
 the
 economic
 gap
 between


Netflix
 and
 all
 competitors
 becomes


insurmountable.
 Netflix's
 nightmare


would
 be
 to
 let
 Paramount
 merge
 or


acquire
 Warner
 Brothers
 because
 together


they
 would
 have
 228
 million
 subs
 with


combined
 content
 libraries
 including


Harry
 Potter,
 Lord
 of
 the
 Rings,
 HBO's


masterpieces,
 and
 all
 of
 Paramount's


movies.
 combines
 spending
 power,


sufficient
 scale
 to
 compete
 on
 content


spending
 per
 subscriber,
 which
 is
 the


biggest
 blocker
 to
 date
 when
 it
 comes
 to


profitability
 for
 streaming
 services,


and
 potential
 contracts
 with
 Sports


League.
 The
 offer
 Netflix
 made
 to
 Warner


Brothers
 allows
 them
 to
 eliminate
 the


middle
 of
 the
 market
 collapse,
 which


brings
 them
 back
 to
 the
 position
 they


were
 in
 in
 mid
 2010s,
 when
 you
 either


have
 Netflix
 scale
 or
 you
 die
 slowly.


Conclusion:


Netflix
 went
 from
 being
 the
 niche


startup
 to
 the
 empire
 that
 calls
 the


shots.
 But
 as
 Netflix
 swallows
 Warner


Brothers,
 we
 have
 to
 understand
 that
 it


comes
 at
 a
 cost.
 Netflix
 has
 proven
 that


efficiency
 beats
 prestige
 and
 can
 buy


the
 artistic
 vision.
 So,
 is
 the
 HBO
 era


of
 slowb
 burn
 masterpieces
 over?
 We'll


see.
 But
 the
 underdog
 is
 now
 the
 Empire.


Let's
 just
 hope
 that
 they
 remember
 why


we
 started
 watching
 in
 the
 first
 place.


We
 hope
 this
 was
 helpful.
 Thanks
 for


watching.
 Till
 next
 time.
 Bye.
