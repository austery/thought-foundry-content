From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm

Abrams

[music]


For
 years,
 social
 media
 companies
 have


relied
 on
 an
 [music]
 impenetrable
 First


Amendment
 protection
 to
 shield
 them
 from


legal
 claims
 that
 their
 products
 are


dangerous
 to
 [music]
 children.


But
 now,
 a
 new
 cluster
 of
 plaintiffs
 are


trying
 a
 different
 tact.


Today,
 my
 colleague
 Siccilia
 Kong


[music]
 explains
 why
 these
 lawsuits
 pose


an
 existential
 threat
 to
 social
 media


giants
 and
 how
 those
 companies
 are


likely
 [music]
 to
 defend
 themselves.


It's
 Thursday,
 [music]


January
 29th.


Trouble
 for
 Tik
 Tok
 as
 a
 group
 of


attorney
 generals
 in
 several
 states
 look


into
 whether
 the
 video
 sharing
 platform


Tik
 Tok
 is
 harmful
 for
 children.


Internal
 research
 at
 Facebook
 found
 that


its
 photo
 sharing
 app
 Instagram
 can
 harm


the
 [music]
 mental
 health
 of
 millions
 of


young
 users.


>> Research
 shows
 95%
 of
 teens
 are
 on


social
 media.
 More
 than
 a
 third
 say


they're
 on
 constantly.
 For
 young
 people,


the
 Tik
 Tok
 platform
 is
 like
 digital


[music]
 nicotine.


>> One
 chart
 showed
 21%
 of
 girls
 in
 the
 US


felt
 somewhat
 worse
 or
 much
 worse
 after


using
 Instagram.


>> Social
 media
 taught
 me
 things
 about


myself
 that
 I
 didn't
 even
 know,
 [music]


like
 how
 I
 had
 an
 ugly
 nose
 or
 how
 my


weight
 wasn't
 the
 proper
 weight.
 Social


media
 said
 the
 solution
 to
 these
 things


[music]
 wasn't
 self-acceptance.
 Social


media
 said
 the
 solution
 to
 these
 things


was
 products
 [music]


and
 sometimes
 even
 surgeries.


Unregulated
 social
 media
 is
 a
 weapon
 of


mass
 destruction
 that
 [music]
 continues


to
 jeopardize
 the
 safety,
 privacy,
 and


well-being
 of
 all
 American
 youth.
 It's


time
 to
 act.


>> As
 a
 dad
 of
 three,
 I'm
 [music]
 angered


and
 horrified.
 As
 an
 attorney
 general,
 I


along
 with
 my
 colleagues
 across
 [music]


the
 country
 are
 taking
 action
 to
 do


something
 about
 it.


Cecilia,
 welcome
 to
 the
 Daily.
 Thanks


for
 having
 me.
 So,
 Cecilia,
 we've
 talked


a
 lot
 on
 this
 show
 about
 the
 claims
 that


social
 media
 is
 harmful
 for
 children,


that
 it
 can
 lead
 to
 mental
 health


disorders,
 social
 isolation,
 and
 there


have
 been
 all
 sorts
 of
 attempts
 over
 the


years
 to
 really
 curb
 the
 reach
 and


influence
 of
 these
 social
 media


platforms.
 Now
 we
 have
 this
 new
 crop
 of


lawsuits
 and
 I
 want
 to
 understand
 how


are
 these
 lawsuits
 any
 different
 from


previous
 attempts
 that
 we've
 seen
 to


regulate
 or
 reign
 in
 these
 companies.


>> So
 these
 social
 media
 companies
 have
 for


years
 faced
 really
 tough
 scrutiny
 and


criticism
 for
 being
 too
 powerful


>> and
 crushing
 competition
 for
 hosting


content
 that
 is
 false.
 all
 kinds
 of


harms
 related
 to
 the
 kind
 of
 content


that
 is
 hosted
 on
 these
 platforms.
 But


the
 cases
 that
 are
 about
 to
 begin
 this


week
 in
 trials
 is
 really
 different
 in


that
 there
 are
 thousands
 of
 individuals,


school
 districts
 and
 state
 attorneys


generals
 that
 have
 come
 together
 in
 a


series
 of
 lawsuits
 that
 are
 arguing
 the


same
 one
 thing,
 which
 is
 that
 social


media
 is
 addictive.
 and
 that
 the


addictive
 nature
 of
 these
 platforms
 have


led
 to
 a
 bevy
 of
 personal
 injuries


including
 anxiety,
 depression,
 suicidal


thoughts,
 eating
 disorders.


>> So
 what's
 really
 different
 is
 this
 is


less
 about
 the
 content
 they
 host
 and


this
 is
 more
 about
 the
 nature
 of
 the


technologies
 and
 this
 is
 a
 really
 novel


legal
 theory.
 It's
 essentially
 social


media's
 big
 tobacco
 moment
 which
 led
 as


you
 know
 to
 many
 years
 of
 litigation


against
 the
 tobacco
 companies
 and


ultimately
 led
 to
 the
 decline
 of
 smoking


and
 so
 many
 in
 social
 media
 see
 this
 as


a
 really
 existential
 moment.
 So


basically
 the
 crux
 of
 this
 is
 that
 these


are
 personal
 injury
 claims,
 right?
 And


that
 effectively
 allows
 the
 plaintiffs


to
 sidestep
 what
 has
 traditionally


shielded
 these
 companies
 from
 liability,


which
 is
 their
 free
 speech
 defense.


That's
 exactly
 right,
 Rachel.
 What
 the


lawyers
 in
 these
 cases
 and
 the


plaintiffs
 are
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 to
 get


around
 that
 legal
 shield
 that
 the
 social


media
 companies
 have
 been
 able
 to
 use
 to


protect
 themselves
 in
 court.
 and
 they're


saying,
 "No,
 this
 is
 actually
 not
 about


speech
 at
 all.
 This
 is
 about
 you


companies
 creating
 and
 engineering


technologies
 to
 be
 harmful
 and
 that


those
 are
 violations
 of
 state
 and


federal
 consumer
 laws."


>> So,
 let's
 walk
 through
 these
 cases.
 How


are
 they
 making
 that
 claim
 specifically?


>> So,
 this
 year
 we
 will
 see
 two
 big


batches
 of
 trials
 begin
 in
 all
 of
 these


cases
 that
 have
 been
 filed.
 And
 the


first
 batch
 that
 takes
 place
 in
 Los


Angeles
 include
 nine
 plaintiffs.
 Nine


trials,
 separate
 trials
 by
 these


different
 plaintiffs.
 They're
 all


individuals
 all
 claiming
 that
 when
 they


were
 young,
 when
 they
 were
 minors,
 they


became
 addicted
 to
 social
 media
 and
 they


suffered
 these
 harms.
 And
 these
 nine


cases,
 they're
 known
 as
 bellweathers


because
 they've
 been
 picked
 out
 of


thousands
 of
 lawsuits
 filed
 by


individuals
 against
 the
 social
 media


companies.
 and
 they're
 seen
 as
 very


representative
 of
 the
 many
 different


charges
 and
 experiences
 that
 individuals


have
 had
 and
 suffered
 as
 they
 claim
 by


becoming
 addicted
 to
 these
 social
 media


companies.


>> So
 the
 first
 case
 and
 trial
 that
 begins


is
 of
 a
 individual
 who's
 goes
 by
 the


initials
 KGM.


She
 is
 a
 now
 20-year-old
 from
 Chico,


California.
 And
 she
 has
 said
 that
 she


created
 her
 first
 social
 media
 account


on
 YouTube
 at
 the
 age
 of
 [music]
 8.
 She


then
 joined
 Instagram
 at
 the
 age
 of
 9


and
 musically,
 which
 is
 now
 known
 as
 Tik


Tok
 at
 the
 age
 of
 10
 and
 Snapchat
 at
 11.


So,
 she's
 been
 using
 all
 the
 social


media
 platforms
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 And
 her


mom
 said
 that
 she
 had
 no
 idea
 that
 these


platforms
 could
 be
 dangerous
 and
 [music]


could
 become
 so
 addictive
 to
 her
 child.


And
 she
 only
 figured
 that
 out
 after


watching
 a
 news
 program
 where
 she


learned
 about
 [music]
 the
 potential


harms
 of
 social
 media.
 Her
 mom
 said
 that


if
 she
 had
 known
 how
 potentially
 harmful


these
 sites
 [music]
 were,
 she
 would
 have


prevented
 her
 daughter
 from
 perhaps
 even


having
 a
 phone
 and
 using
 the
 apps.


[music]


And
 what
 KGM,
 the
 plaintiff,
 is
 arguing


is
 that
 the
 social
 media
 platforms
 were


incredibly
 alluring
 to
 her
 and
 that
 she


got
 hooked.
 And
 [music]
 these
 very


addictive
 products
 that
 use
 features


like
 infinite
 scrolling,
 meaning
 it's


just
 so
 easy
 to
 keep
 scrolling
 and


scrolling
 and
 things
 like
 autoplay


videos
 where
 [music]
 right
 after
 you


finish
 a
 video,
 the
 next
 one's
 queued
 up


before
 you
 even
 think
 about
 it.
 and


algorithms
 that
 direct
 you
 and
 recommend


particular
 [music]


content
 that
 she
 has
 found
 to
 be
 very


toxic.
 That
 all
 these
 features
 [music]


led
 her
 to
 overuse
 social
 media
 and


become
 addicted.
 And
 that
 in
 turn
 led
 to


lots
 of
 mental
 health
 problems
 including


anxiety,
 depression,
 [music]


suicidal
 thoughts
 and
 body
 image
 issues


for
 her.
 H.


[music]


So
 these
 are
 the
 kinds
 of
 claims
 that
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have
 become


familiar
 with
 by
 now.
 The
 idea
 that


young
 people
 can
 develop
 any
 number
 of


mental
 and
 emotional
 conditions
 from


repeated
 exposure
 to
 social
 media


platforms.
 What
 is
 some
 of the
 other


litigation
 that
 you're
 watching?


>> So
 the
 next
 big
 wave
 begins
 around
 June


in
 federal
 court.
 They're
 all
 bundled


together
 and
 they're
 brought
 by


attorneys
 general
 in
 dozens
 of
 states
 as


well
 as
 school
 districts.
 And
 those
 are


really
 interesting,
 Rachel,
 in
 that
 they


are
 charging
 the
 companies
 with
 being
 a


public
 nuisances
 that
 the
 fact
 that
 they


as
 school
 districts
 and
 states
 have
 had


to
 shoulder
 the
 costs
 of
 mental
 health


services,
 phone
 programs
 within
 schools,


all
 kinds
 of
 programs
 to
 deal
 with
 a


youth
 crisis.
 And
 so
 they
 are
 suing
 the


companies
 for
 monetary
 damages.
 And


they're
 also
 saying
 that
 they
 would
 like


to
 see
 big
 changes
 within
 the
 companies


that
 the
 platforms
 have
 to
 give
 up
 some


of
 these
 addictive
 technology
 features.


>> Given
 that
 these
 are
 all
 personal
 injury


claims,
 what
 do
 the
 plaintiffs
 actually


need
 to
 prove
 in
 order
 to
 prevail
 in


court?


>> What
 these
 plaintiffs
 have
 to
 prove
 is


that
 social
 media
 is
 linked
 to


addiction.
 And
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 hard.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 new
 sort
 of
 argument


that
 hasn't
 been
 tested
 before.
 And
 so


they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 show
 that
 there


is
 expert
 evidence
 that
 the
 use
 of
 tools


like
 infinite
 scrolling
 on
 Tik
 Tok
 and


on
 Instagram
 and
 autoplay
 of
 video
 are


features
 that
 have
 led
 to
 compulsive
 use


and
 that
 there
 is
 a
 direct
 link
 between


the
 technology
 and
 behavior.


And
 they'll
 also
 have
 to
 show
 that
 these


companies
 knew
 all
 along
 that
 their


products
 were
 harmful
 and
 that
 they


withheld
 what
 they
 knew
 from
 the
 public.


>> So
 what's
 the
 best
 evidence
 that
 the


plaintiffs
 have
 to
 show
 what
 you're


describing
 as
 a
 causal
 link
 between
 the


technology
 and
 the
 harm?


So,
 there
 have
 been
 numerous
 studies


done
 on
 the
 mental
 health
 effects
 of


social
 media.
 But
 what
 the
 plaintiffs


are
 going
 to
 really
 rely
 on
 is
 hundreds


of
 thousands
 of
 documents
 that
 they've


collected
 in
 discovery
 ahead
 of
 these


trials
 that
 the
 plaintiff's
 lawyers
 say


show
 that
 the
 companies
 knew
 that
 there


was
 a
 problem
 and
 they
 found
 internally


that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 troubling


evidence
 about
 their
 products
 and
 how


they
 affected
 young
 people.
 For
 example,


in
 2018,


Meta
 began
 studying
 how
 beauty
 filters


on
 Instagram.


>> Beauty
 filters,
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 those


are
 the
 filter
 you
 can
 put
 on
 your
 face


or
 somebody
 else's
 face
 to
 make
 them


more
 beautiful,
 to
 just
 alter
 the
 image,


right?


>> Yes.
 And
 they
 began
 studying
 that
 in


2018
 and
 um
 decided
 in
 2019
 after
 a
 lot


of
 backlash
 publicly
 that
 they
 would
 ban


the
 filter.
 But
 that
 same
 year
 in
 2019,


Mark
 Zuckerberg,
 the
 CEO,
 considered


bringing
 the
 filters
 back
 to
 Instagram.


These
 were
 big
 drivers
 of
 engagement
 and


young
 people
 like
 to
 use
 them.


>> And
 employees
 within
 the
 company


implored
 him
 not
 to,
 including
 an


executive,
 because
 she
 said
 they
 were


really
 just
 so
 toxic
 for
 particularly


young
 girls.
 and
 she
 said
 that
 her
 own


daughter
 suffered
 from
 body
 dysmorphia


and
 she
 sent
 an
 email
 directly
 to


Zuckerberg
 asking
 him
 to
 reconsider.
 He


ignored
 the
 email
 and
 decided
 in
 2020
 to


reinstate
 the
 beauty
 filters.
 And
 so


lawyers
 for
 KGM
 are
 going
 to
 point
 to


these
 internal
 documents
 and
 say
 that


this
 is
 really
 the
 proof
 that
 the


company
 not
 only
 studied
 the
 problem,


they
 recognized
 there
 was
 a
 problem
 and


yet
 they
 did
 not
 tell
 the
 public
 about


the
 problem.
 They
 allowed
 the
 tools
 to


continue
 operating.


>> And
 what
 are
 the
 plaintiffs
 asking
 for


specifically?
 Obviously
 money,
 but
 can


you
 just
 give
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 more


specifics
 on
 their
 demands?


>> The
 plaintiffs
 are
 asking,
 as
 you
 said,


for
 monetary
 damages,
 and
 they
 are
 also


asking
 for
 changes
 to
 the
 designs
 of


these
 platforms.
 So,
 they're
 going
 to


ask
 for
 stronger
 age
 verification
 and


tools
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 underage
 users


are
 no
 longer
 able
 to
 escape
 the
 terms


and
 service
 and
 and
 use
 the
 platforms.


They'll
 probably
 also
 ask
 for
 more


parental
 controls
 and
 that
 the
 companies


remove
 addictive
 features
 like
 infinite


scroll
 and
 autoplay
 of
 videos
 and
 snap


streaks.


>> I'm
 really
 going
 to
 show
 my
 age
 here,


Cecilia,
 but
 what
 is
 a
 snap
 streak?
 Oh,


so
 a
 snap
 streak
 is
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 game,


and
 this
 is
 why
 it's
 been
 accused
 of


being
 addictive.
 It's
 messaging
 between


two
 people.
 And
 the
 idea
 is
 to
 create
 a


streak
 of
 messages
 between
 two
 people.


And
 you
 maintain
 a
 streak
 by


communicating
 every
 day
 and
 sending


snaps,
 which
 are
 usually
 visuals,
 like
 a


photo
 or
 some
 sort
 of
 a
 video
 or
 some


sort
 of
 a
 message.
 And
 you
 keep
 your


streak
 going
 if
 you
 communicate
 every


day.
 You
 lose
 your
 streak
 if
 you
 stop


even
 for
 one
 day.


>> I
 see.
 And
 that
 does
 seem
 very
 clearly


like
 an
 example
 of
 a
 tool
 that
 is


designed
 to
 keep
 you
 on
 the
 platform
 as


much
 as
 possible,
 which
 is
 part
 of
 the


business
 model,
 right?
 That's
 what
 these


companies
 are
 trying
 to
 do
 with
 their


users.
 So
 it
 makes
 sense
 that
 if
 you


take
 those
 features
 away,
 that
 could


pose,
 as
 you
 said,
 kind
 of
 an


existential
 threat
 to
 the
 entire


business
 model.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 it's
 important
 to
 keep


in
 mind
 that
 the
 business
 model
 is


advertising.
 And
 what
 really
 fuels


advertising
 revenue
 is
 engagement,


>> right?


>> Engagement
 is
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 this.
 And


these
 tools
 are
 meant
 to
 keep
 people


more
 engaged.


>> So
 you
 can
 see
 why
 these
 trials
 are


really
 so
 potentially
 damaging
 for
 these


companies.


>> [music]


>> And
 so
 that's
 why
 we've
 seen
 two


companies,
 Snap
 and
 [snorts and music]


Tik
 Tok,
 settle
 the
 very
 first
 case
 with


KGM.


[music]
 We
 don't
 know
 the
 terms
 of
 those


settlements,
 but
 Meta
 and
 YouTube
 are


still
 scheduled
 to
 go
 to
 trial
 as


defendants
 in
 KGM's
 lawsuit
 [music]
 and


appear
 very
 determined
 to
 continue
 to


take
 this
 to
 trial.


>> [music]


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Cecilia,
 if
 these
 lawsuits
 are
 so


existential
 potentially
 for
 some
 of


these
 social
 media
 companies,
 why
 would


some
 of
 them
 not
 settle
 the
 way
 that
 Tik


Tok
 and
 Snap
 did
 with
 that
 first
 case?


Presumably
 the
 money
 that
 they
 would


have
 to
 pay
 to
 settle
 is
 nothing


compared
 with
 having
 to
 alter
 an
 entire


business
 model,
 right?
 So
 why
 even
 take


the
 risk
 and
 go
 to
 trial?
 Well,
 there


are
 many
 trials
 that
 are
 scheduled
 first


of
 all.
 So
 even
 though
 two
 companies


were
 able
 to
 settle
 with
 KGM
 in
 this


first
 case,
 there
 are
 numerous
 more
 in


the
 state
 court
 as
 well
 as
 in
 federal


court
 going
 forward.
 The
 other
 thing
 to


keep
 in
 mind
 is
 that
 the
 companies,


especially
 Meta
 and
 YouTube,
 really
 feel


strongly
 that
 they
 have
 a
 good
 case
 on


their
 side
 and
 they
 will
 bring
 up
 speech


protections.
 Like
 you
 mentioned,
 Rachel,


they're
 going
 to
 say
 that
 there
 is
 a
 law


known
 as
 section
 230
 of
 the


Communications
 Decency
 Act
 that
 shields


internet
 companies
 from
 the
 content
 they


host.
 because
 section
 230
 has
 been
 so


broad
 and
 so
 strongly
 used
 in
 their


favor
 in
 so
 many
 different
 instances
 and


so
 they're
 feeling
 pretty
 confident
 that


they
 can
 rely
 on
 that
 legal
 shield
 once


again.


>> In
 addition,
 they
 reject
 the
 idea
 that


social
 media
 can
 be
 linked
 to
 personal


injury
 and
 the
 company's
 lawyers
 are


expected
 to
 argue
 that
 there
 are
 many


factors
 that
 go
 into
 mental
 health


issues.
 They're
 going
 to
 say
 that
 it's


multiffactorial.
 could
 be
 school


problems,
 stress
 with
 friends,
 there


could
 be
 all
 kinds
 of
 factors
 that
 lead


to
 anxiety,
 depression,
 and
 other
 me


mental
 health
 disorders
 and
 not
 social


media
 alone,
 right?
 And
 the
 causal
 link


does
 in
 fairness
 feel
 like
 something


worth
 grappling
 with,
 right?
 Because
 how


do
 you
 distinguish
 the
 impact,
 for


example,
 of
 social
 media
 from
 a
 culture


that
 promotes
 certain
 beauty
 standards


and
 certain
 body
 types,
 right?
 like
 is


it
 actually
 possible
 to
 isolate
 and


prove
 causation
 back
 to
 a
 specific


social
 media
 platform?


>> What
 the
 plaintiff's
 lawyers
 are
 going


to
 try
 to
 do
 is
 to
 again
 draw
 from
 all


the
 internal
 documents
 they've
 collected


and
 they
 will
 try
 to
 show
 how
 the
 push


to
 increase
 engagement
 and
 to
 make
 their


products
 sticky
 and
 even
 addictive.
 But


ultimately
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 a
 jury
 in


these
 California
 cases.


Juries
 will
 decide
 the
 subsequent
 cases


as
 well
 and
 that
 might
 be
 favorable
 for


the
 plaintiffs
 because
 everyone
 has
 a


story
 about
 social
 media.
 We
 know
 for


example
 that
 the
 majority
 of
 American


parents
 see
 social
 media
 as
 a
 problem


and
 yet
 the
 companies
 have
 so
 far


escaped
 scrutiny.
 Cecilia,
 if
 this
 does


end
 up
 being
 social
 media's
 big
 tobacco


moment
 and
 they
 lose
 these
 cases
 in


court
 and
 a
 jury
 decides
 that
 this
 is
 in


fact
 an
 addictive
 product,
 that
 means


that
 we
 have
 an
 entire
 generation
 of


kids
 who
 are
 now
 addicted.


And
 so
 I
 wonder,
 we've
 been
 talking
 this


whole
 conversation
 a
 lot
 about
 what


happens
 to
 the
 social
 media
 companies,


but
 what
 happens
 to
 these
 children
 that


have
 essentially
 been
 the
 guinea
 pigs


for
 this
 massive
 social
 experiment?


Remember
 decades
 ago
 when
 the
 trials


began
 against
 big
 tobacco?
 It
 seemed


crazy
 and
 really
 far-fetched
 to
 accuse


the
 companies
 of
 creating
 an
 addictive


and
 harmful
 product.
 But
 they
 did.
 And


with
 social
 media,
 with
 all
 of
 these


young
 people
 who
 have
 been
 blamed
 for


years
 for
 being
 unable
 to
 regulate
 their


use
 of
 these
 social
 media
 apps,
 the


conversation
 might
 change.
 the
 blame


could
 lie
 in
 a
 different
 place
 with
 the


social
 media
 companies.
 Now,
 that
 won't


take
 back
 the
 experiences
 of
 so
 many


young
 people
 who
 say
 they've
 been
 harmed


by
 these
 social
 media
 platforms,


but
 it
 could
 profoundly
 change
 the


conversation
 in
 our
 society.


[music]


>> Cecilia
 Kong,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 your


time.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me,
 Rachel.
 [music]

 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


On
 Wednesday,
 [music]
 the
 Federal


Reserve
 voted
 to
 keep
 interest
 rates
 at


their
 current
 levels
 despite
 enormous


pressure
 from
 President
 Trump
 to
 cut


rates.
 Two
 Fed
 governors,
 both
 [music]


appointed
 by
 President
 Trump,
 cast


dissenting
 votes.
 But
 Fed
 Chairman


Jerome
 Powell
 continues
 to
 reject


Trump's
 demands
 for
 a
 rate
 cut,
 even


after
 the
 administration
 [music]
 opened


an
 unusual
 criminal
 investigation
 this


month
 into
 Powell's
 conduct.
 [music]


And


>> our
 founders
 debated
 extensively
 over


which
 branch
 of
 government
 should
 have


the
 power
 to
 declare
 [music]
 or
 initiate


war.
 Virtually
 unanimously
 they
 decided


and
 what
 was
 entered
 into
 the


constitution
 was
 that
 the
 declaration
 or


initiation
 of
 war
 would
 be
 the
 [music]


power
 of
 congress.
 Many


>> in
 a
 series
 of
 pointed
 exchanges
 on


Wednesday,
 senators
 of
 both
 parties,


including
 Republican
 Rand
 Paul
 of


Kentucky
 pressed
 Secretary
 of
 State


Marco
 Rubio
 [music]
 to
 explain
 why


neither
 he
 nor
 President
 Trump
 consulted


with
 Congress
 before
 sending
 US
 troops


into
 Venezuela
 to
 arrest
 and
 remove
 the


country's
 president.


So
 I
 would
 ask
 you,
 if
 a
 [music]
 foreign


country
 bombed
 our
 air
 defense
 missiles,


captured
 and
 removed
 our
 president,
 and


blockaded
 our
 country,
 would
 that
 be


considered
 an
 act
 of
 war?
 Would
 it
 be
 an


act
 of
 war?


>> We
 just
 don't
 believe
 that
 this


operation
 comes
 anywhere
 close
 to
 the


constitutional
 definition
 of
 war.


>> But
 would
 it
 be
 an
 act
 of
 war
 if
 someone


did
 it
 to
 us?
 Of
 course,
 it
 would
 be
 an


act
 of
 war.
 I'm
 calling
 anti-war.
 During


the
 hearing,
 Rubio
 refused
 [music]
 to


rule
 out
 future
 US
 military
 action
 in


Venezuela,
 but
 said
 that
 President
 Trump


has
 no
 desire
 to
 send
 American
 troops


back
 to
 the
 country.
