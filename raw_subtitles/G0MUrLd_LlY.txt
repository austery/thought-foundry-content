Hello
 my
 friends.
 Today
 is
 December
 10th


and
 this
 is
 my
 December
 FOMC
 debrief.


All right,
 we
 just
 had
 the
 press


conference
 and
 let
 me
 tell
 you,
 I
 think


it
 was
 a
 super
 interesting
 meeting
 and


surprisingly
 surprisingly
 dovish.
 Now


before
 we
 talk
 about
 what
 happened


today,
 let's
 level
 sit
 a
 little
 bit.
 Now


heading
 into
 this
 meeting,
 everyone


widely
 expected
 that
 the
 Fed
 will
 cut,


but
 that
 was
 not
 always
 the
 case.
 Now
 in


September,
 the
 Fed
 did
 guide
 towards
 a


cut
 here
 in
 December.
 But
 then
 remember


the
 last
 meeting,
 PAL
 basically
 started


the
 press
 conference
 saying
 that


additional
 cuts
 are
 far
 from
 guaranteed,


noting
 that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 dissent


on
 the
 FOMC.
 In
 the
 weeks
 that
 followed,


we
 began
 to
 hear
 more
 about
 these


descents.
 We
 have
 all
 these
 Fed


presidents
 come
 out
 and
 say
 that,
 you


know,
 we
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 cutting
 rates


anymore.
 You
 know,
 inflation's
 a
 problem


and
 so
 forth.
 And
 so
 after
 hearing
 that


the
 market
 priced
 out
 a
 December
 cut.


However,
 uh
 just
 as
 blackout
 period
 was


beginning,
 blackout
 period
 is
 the
 period


before
 a
 Fed
 meeting
 where
 Fed
 officials


are
 no
 longer
 allowed
 to
 speak.
 We
 had


some
 heavy
 hitters
 come
 out
 and
 say
 that


you
 know
 rate
 cut
 in
 December.
 I
 I
 could


support
 that.
 Now
 the
 way
 that
 the
 Fed


works
 is
 that
 whereas
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of


people
 on
 the
 committee
 Fed
 presidents


can
 vote
 on
 a
 rotating
 basis
 um
 each


person
 is
 unequal
 in
 their
 influence.


Now
 as
 it
 turned
 out
 the
 guys
 that
 have


been
 on
 the
 committee
 for
 a
 long
 time


people
 who
 are
 more
 influential
 and
 have


a
 track
 record
 of
 being
 correct
 they


were
 voting
 for
 cuts
 and
 the
 guys
 who


are
 new
 um
 they
 were
 more
 hawkish
 and


they
 did
 not
 get
 their
 way.
 So
 that
 uh


brings
 us
 to
 today
 where
 we
 did
 get


indeed
 a
 Fed
 cut.
 And
 looking
 at
 uh
 the


voting,
 it
 looks
 like
 we
 also
 got


desents.
 We
 have
 Governor
 Myin
 of
 course


uh
 would
 like
 to
 have
 50
 basis
 points.


He's
 done
 this
 a
 few
 times
 now.
 And
 we


also
 have
 a
 couple
 Fed
 presidents
 who


desented
 preferring
 not
 to
 cut
 at
 all.


So
 but
 in
 any
 case,
 Cherpaw
 was
 able
 to


muster
 together
 a
 majority
 and
 push


through
 a
 cut.
 Now,
 this
 was
 also
 one
 of


these
 special
 Fend
 meetings
 where
 we
 got


a
 dot
 plot.
 Remember,
 we
 get
 the
 dot


plot
 quarterly.
 And
 on
 the
 dot
 plot,


what
 each
 Fed
 official
 marks
 down
 is


their
 forecasts
 for
 inflation,
 for


rates,
 for
 uh
 Fed
 policy
 over
 the
 next


few
 years.
 Now,
 what's
 really


interesting
 about
 this
 stop
 plot
 is
 that


it
 was
 mostly
 unchanged
 except
 that
 um


inflation
 was
 actually
 forecast
 uh
 the


for
 to
 be
 better.
 So
 they
 lowered
 their


inflation
 forecast.
 U
 the
 median
 Fed


participant
 lowered
 their
 inflation


forecast.
 So
 you
 know
 having
 more


disinflation
 of
 course
 uh
 is
 suggestive


of
 uh
 more
 rate
 cuts
 since
 of
 course


inflation
 is
 expected
 to
 to
 get
 better.


Now


one
 other
 thing
 that
 happened
 of
 course


was
 the
 balance
 sheet
 thing
 which
 which


we'll
 talk
 about
 a
 bit
 later.
 So
 I
 found


the
 press
 conference
 to
 be
 very


interesting
 because
 it
 kind
 of
 gives


away
 the
 Fed's
 hand
 and
 struck
 me
 as


very
 very
 dovish.
 Now
 as
 we
 know
 the
 Fed


has
 two
 mandates,
 full
 employment
 and


price
 stability.
 Let's
 listen
 to
 what


Chowo
 thought
 about
 employment.
 Payroll


jobs
 uh
 averaging
 40,000
 per
 month
 since


April.
 We
 think
 there's
 an
 overstatement


in
 in
 these
 numbers
 by
 about
 60,000.
 So


that
 would
 be
 negative
 20,000
 per
 month.


>> So
 chairp
 is
 basically
 saying
 that
 you


know
 our
 official
 numbers
 government


data
 is
 saying
 that
 we
 created
 on


average
 you
 know
 40,000
 jobs
 a
 month
 but


based
 on
 our
 own
 data
 we're
 thinking


that
 post
 revisions
 it's
 actually
 more


like
 negative
 20,000
 a
 month.
 Now,
 if
 we


are
 losing
 20,000
 jobs
 a
 month,


obviously
 that
 is
 a
 problem
 and


obviously
 that
 calls
 for
 not
 just


neutral
 monetary
 policy
 but
 uh
 easy


policy.
 So
 that
 in
 my
 view
 opens
 the


door
 for
 more
 cuts
 than
 the
 market
 is


pricing
 in.


Now
 a
 more
 hawkish
 person
 would
 say
 yeah


we're
 losing
 jobs
 but
 also
 in
 part


because
 our
 population
 growth
 has
 slowed


a
 lot.
 Yeah,
 but
 I
 think
 by
 any
 measure,


losing
 20,000
 jobs
 a
 month
 is
 going
 to


continue
 to
 push
 the
 unemployment
 rate


higher.
 That
 that's
 actually
 I
 think
 if


we
 got
 an
 NFP
 print
 and
 we're
 going
 to


get
 one
 next
 week,
 that
 that
 had
 a


negative
 number.
 I
 think
 the
 market


would
 react
 very
 strongly
 by
 pricing
 in


a
 lot
 more
 cuts.


At
 the
 moment,
 the
 market
 is
 pricing
 in


we
 get
 two
 more
 cuts
 next
 year
 and
 stop


at
 around
 3%.
 that
 is
 uh
 under
 the
 power


fed
 what
 the
 medium
 voter
 considers
 to


be
 the
 neutral
 rate.
 So
 moving
 on
 to
 the


inflation
 uh
 data.
 So
 again
 as
 we
 all


know
 inflation
 is
 higher
 than
 the
 Fed's


target.
 It's
 about
 3%
 though
 they


forecast
 it
 will
 continue
 to
 decline.


Here's
 what
 Paul
 said
 about
 inflation.


The
 story
 with
 inflation
 and
 uh
 you
 know


we're
 well
 aware
 that
 this
 is
 a
 story
 at


this
 point
 is
 that
 if
 you
 get
 away
 from


tariffs
 inflation
 is
 in
 the
 low
 twos


right
 so
 it's
 really
 tariffs
 and
 that


that's
 causing
 the
 most
 of
 the
 inflation


overshoot
 and
 we
 do
 think
 of
 those
 as


likely
 to
 in
 the
 current
 situation
 as


likely
 to
 be
 a
 one-time


you
 know
 one-time
 price
 increase.


So
 what
 he's
 saying
 is
 that
 yeah,
 it's


it's
 above
 target,
 but
 that's
 mostly
 due


to
 tariffs
 and
 tariffs
 are
 temporary.
 So


you
 take
 that
 out,
 yeah,
 we're
 basically


at
 2%.
 Now,
 you
 know,
 you
 put
 two
 and


two
 together,
 inflation
 basically
 at
 2%,


labor
 market
 in
 trouble.
 That's
 a
 that's


a
 call
 for
 policy
 to
 move
 to
 um
 easing.


So
 I
 think
 that's
 um
 not
 in
 the
 market.


And
 looking
 at
 assets
 like
 gold
 and


silver,
 that's
 uh
 quite
 bullish
 for


them.
 Harder
 to
 say
 on
 the
 equity


market,
 um
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 rate
 cuts


are
 positive
 equities.
 On
 the
 other


hand,
 recession
 is
 not
 positive
 for


equities.
 If
 I
 had
 to
 bet,
 I
 would
 guess


that
 the
 equity
 market
 cares
 more
 about


rate
 cuts.
 Now,
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 was


super
 interesting
 that
 happened
 this
 is


that
 the
 Fed
 announced
 its
 restarting
 of


reserve
 management
 purchases.
 So
 what


they
 said
 is
 they're
 going
 to
 start


buying
 uh
 Treasury
 bills
 to
 the
 tune
 of


40
 billion
 a
 month
 for
 the
 next
 few


months
 and
 then
 adjust
 thereafter.
 Now


the
 way
 the
 reason
 they're
 doing
 this
 is


because
 there's
 upward
 pressure
 in
 the


money
 market
 rates
 and
 we're
 also


heading
 towards
 year
 end
 where
 often


times
 there's
 significant
 pressure
 in


money
 market
 rates.
 So
 they
 don't
 want


to
 have
 another,
 you
 know,
 re


repocalypse
 as
 they
 call
 it
 where
 repo


rates
 surged
 in
 late
 2019.
 So,
 they're


getting
 ahead
 of
 this.
 And
 I
 would
 also


note
 that
 all
 the
 way
 back
 in
 November,


I
 had
 called
 this
 and
 at
 that
 time
 it


was
 super
 non-
 consensus.
 And
 uh
 some


people
 were
 on
 Twitter
 calling
 me


stupid.
 Uh
 but
 that
 is
 exactly
 what


happened
 today
 guys.
 Everyone
 has


different
 levels
 of
 expertise
 and


different
 domains
 and
 so
 forth.
 But
 when


it
 comes
 to
 money
 markets,
 the
 financial


system,
 uh,
 well,
 listen,
 I
 I
 spent
 a


number
 of
 years
 on
 the
 open
 markets
 desk


having
 access
 to
 tons
 of
 confidential


data,
 tons
 of
 conversations
 with
 market


participants.
 This
 is
 something
 that
 I


am
 really,
 really
 good
 at.
 And
 so,
 it


was
 not
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 see
 that
 this


would
 happen.
 If
 you
 understand
 the


financial
 system
 and
 the
 Fed
 and
 I'd


also
 note
 last
 week,
 one
 big
 bank,
 Bank


of
 America,
 also
 jumped
 on
 the


bandwagon.
 and
 uh
 today
 we
 were
 both


proved
 correct.
 So
 very
 interesting
 and


of
 course
 I
 personally
 don't
 really


think
 of
 this
 as
 having
 too
 big
 of
 an


impact
 on
 markets
 but
 I
 also
 know
 that


there
 are
 people
 uh
 who
 perceive
 this
 to


be
 risk
 positive
 and
 that's
 kind
 of


enough.
 All
 right
 so
 that's
 how
 I


prepared
 for
 today
 super
 interesting
 Fed


meeting
 and
 next
 year
 you
 know


everything
 is
 going
 to
 change.
 Uh


yesterday
 there
 was
 a
 headline
 that


President
 Trump
 was
 uh
 looking
 at
 the


Fed
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 some
 of


these
 Fed
 governor
 appointments,
 they


were
 signed
 maybe
 by
 the
 autopen.
 Maybe


someone
 should
 look
 into
 that,
 right?


You
 can't
 have
 the
 autopin
 sign
 it.


That's
 uh
 that's
 not
 correct.
 And
 of


course,
 he's
 probably
 joking,
 but
 you


know,
 they're
 going
 to
 turn
 up
 the


pressure
 and
 find
 ways
 to
 have
 more


control.
 Uh
 let's
 see
 what
 they
 do.
 All


right,
 talk
 to
 you
 guys
 um
 Saturday.
