Markets were on edge this week as Donald 
Trump’s August 1st deadline for trade  
negotiations on US tariffs finally ran out.
Trump has already announced tariffs on goods  
imported from many of America’s largest 
trading partners, as trade negotiators  
rushed to strike last-minute deals 
or extensions before time ran out.
 
The deadline came more than 120 days after 
Trump first announced his list of “Liberation  
Day” tariffs on imported goods on April 2nd.
Despite delays, the Trump administration now  
looks ready to roll out new tariff rates 
for the countries that didn’t manage to  
secure a deal before the Friday deadline.
White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt  
announced that two-thirds of the US’s 18 
major trading partners already have a deal,  
and that letters have been sent 
to an additional 17 nations.
 
The White House said that countries that have 
not struck a trade deal, or have not received  
a letter with a new tariff rate, will hear from 
the Trump administration by midnight on Friday.  
Taiwan - the world’s most important 
semiconductor exporter - was hit with  
a 20% tariff. Tariffs were raised on Canada, 
a historic US ally and major trading partner,  
to 35 per cent. India was hit with a 25 per 
cent tariff and Switzerland with 39 percent.  
 
Trump said that he would not be extending the 
deadline this time around. Tweeting “THE AUGUST  
FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE – IT 
STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED. A BIG  
DAY FOR AMERICA!!!” on his version of Twitter – 
which is called Truth Social, earlier this week.
 
On Thursday he announced that he would 
delay higher tariffs on Mexico by 90 days.
 
At midnight this Thursday, US Customs and 
Border Protection began charging importers  
the new duties, which range from 10 percent to 50 
percent, with additional tariffs being applied to  
certain industries like pharmaceutical products, 
copper, steel and aluminum for most countries.
 
The Yale University Budget Lab announced on 
Monday that U.S. consumers face an effective  
tariff rate of 18.2% - the highest rate since 1934 
– which means that the average household will see  
additional costs of $2,400 in 2025. That analysis 
came out before the announcement of additional  
tariffs on India and the announcement 
delaying higher tariffs on Mexico.
 
US and Chinese negotiators agreed earlier this 
week to push back the deadline for striking a  
deal after talks failed to find a resolution 
this week across the many areas of dispute.
 
Back in April, Trump had claimed to have done 
“over 200 deals” in an interview with Time  
Magazine, and trade advisor Peter Navarro had 
said that “90 deals in 90 days” was possible.  
The country has fallen far short of 
that, with only eight deals in 120 days,  
including one with the 27-member European Union.
The UK was the first country to strike a trade  
deal with Trump back in May, agreeing to 
a flat 10 per cent tax which US buyers  
will pay on most goods imported from the UK.
This was possibly the easiest deal to strike  
for Trump – due to the favorable preexisting trade 
dynamics between the US and the UK – where Britain  
only ran a very small trade surplus in goods 
with the United States – and it would appear  
that Trump prioritizes goods over services as 
his 2025 Trade Policy Agenda explicitly calls  
for a “production economy”, emphasizing 
manufacturing, agriculture, and energy  
as the backbone of American prosperity.
Britain – like the US runs a Trade deficit,  
meaning that it imports more goods and 
services than it exports. In fact it runs  
the third largest trade deficit in the world 
– behind only India and the United States.
 
Within days of the deal being announced, 
the Financial Times reported that China  
was upset that it had been structured to squeeze 
Chinese products out of British supply chains.  
Chinas Foreign Ministry said that it was a 
“basic principle” that agreements between  
countries should not target other nations.
According to the FT, China has warned other  
countries against signing trade deals with 
the US that threaten Chinese interests.
 
Before we go any further, let me tell you 
about this weeks video sponsor, SHOKZ
 
The US-UK trade deal - was described by President 
Trump as being “full and comprehensive” - it kept  
in place the 10 per cent tax on most British 
imports – in particular – it specified that  
cars imported from the UK would face a 10% 
tariff in the United States, which is lower  
than the 15% rate that Americans will have to 
pay on cars imported from the EU and Japan.
 
The deal only applies to the first 
100,000 British cars imported per year,  
which is approximately the number of cars that 
Americans already buy from Britain and every  
vehicle sold above that quota will be hit with 
a 25% tax, discouraging any increase in sales.
 
The feature of the deal that upset China 
was that the tariff relief for steel and  
cars bought by Americans included conditions 
requiring the UK to "promptly meet" US demands  
on the "security of the supply chains" of steel 
and aluminium products exported to America.
 
The Chinese worry that this could 
mean that they could be excluded from  
supplying British firms that sell to the US.
The British government pushed back against  
suggestions the trade deal could be damaging to 
China – saying that there was no such thing as a  
veto on Chinese investment" in the deal.
A British government spokesperson told  
the BBC that the agreement with the US 
was "in the national interest to secure  
thousands of jobs across key sectors, 
protect British businesses and lay the  
groundwork for greater trade in the future".
Adding that “any external provisions" in  
the agreement were "not designed 
to undermine mutually beneficial  
economic relations with any third country.”
This was widely interpreted as a reference to  
British Steel, which had been owned by China’s 
Jingye Group until earlier this year. Although  
the UK government took operational control 
of the company to prevent the closure of  
its Scunthorpe blast furnaces, Jingye remains 
the legal owner. Under the terms of the deal,  
steel from such facilities may not qualify 
for tariff relief unless ownership is  
restructured to meet U.S. standards.
This approach reflects what might be a  
broader shift in U.S. trade policy under Trump. 
Tariffs are no longer just a tool for protecting  
domestic industry—they are being used as a 
mechanism for enforcing geopolitical alignment.  
The UK deal, in this sense, might be a prototype 
for a new kind of trade agreement: one that  
rewards compliance with U.S. strategic objectives 
and penalizes economic entanglement with China.
 
Beijing’s reaction to the UK deal was swift 
and pointed. Chinese officials warned other  
countries that they deal with against signing 
agreements with the US that threaten Chinese  
interests and China accelerated its efforts to 
remove foreign components from domestic supply  
chains. The goal being - to insulate China 
from future trade disruptions and reduce  
dependency on foreign technology and inputs.
This strategy broadly aligns with China’s long  
standing “dual circulation” policy, which aims 
to boost domestic consumption and technological  
self-sufficiency while maintaining selective 
engagement with global markets. The UK–US deal,  
and others like it, have possibly reinforced 
Beijing’s determination to reduce its risk  
of being pressured by foreign governments.
China has also been responding diplomatically  
to US pressure by stepping up engagement with 
countries in Southeast Asia, the Global South and  
within the BRICS bloc, offering alternative trade 
and investment partnerships. At the same time,  
it has continued trade talks with the U.S., 
resulting in a 90-day truce in May that  
temporarily reduced tariffs on Chinese goods 
from as high as 145% to around 40%. That truce,  
however, is fragile. Trump has tied further tariff 
reductions to cooperation on unrelated issues,  
making it difficult to know if a deal when struck 
will be stuck to or renegotiated again on a whim.
 
This transactional approach has left Beijing very 
wary. Chinese officials have indicated they will  
raise concerns directly with the UK and U.S. but 
are avoiding escalation—possibly to preserve room  
for negotiation or to avoid disruption ahead of 
a potential Trump–Xi summit later this year.
 
While other Asian countries may be nervous of 
China, they see that Chinese companies will  
still invest in their countries while American 
businesses are retrenching to North America.
 
The EU’s agreement with Washington, finalized a 
few days ago, was broader in scope. It imposed  
a 15% tariff on roughly 70% of EU exports to the 
U.S., including pharmaceuticals, semiconductors,  
and cars. In exchange, the EU pledged to buy 
$750 billion dollars in U.S. energy and invest  
$600 billion dollars in American industry. 
Steel and aluminum exports were capped  
under a quota system, with excess volumes 
facing a 50% tariff. In return – The EU  
decided to put no tariffs on US goods.
The one sided nature of this deal is  
somewhat surprising – as the European 
and US economies are fairly similar  
in size - and the trade relationships 
are interrelated in both directions.
 
Ben Hall argued on the Unhedged Podcast that 
the asymmetry of the US-EU trade deal stems  
from the structural and philosophical nature of 
the European Union itself. The EU was founded to  
promote free trade and market liberalization among 
its member states, making it inherently reluctant  
to impose tariffs or engage in aggressive 
trade retaliation. This foundational ethos,  
combined with the EU’s fragmented decision-making 
process—where divergent national interests often  
hinder unified action—left Europe unable 
to respond decisively to the protectionist  
stance of the US. As a result, the EU accepted 
a one-sided deal, prioritizing internal unity  
and stability over economic leverage.
Critics in Paris and Berlin were quick  
to describe the deal as capitulation. The FT’s 
editorial board described it as “rubber stamping  
the U.S. president’s new world order,” arguing 
that Europe had validated Trump’s bullying trade  
agenda. The Economist - offered a more pragmatic 
take, arguing that the EU had secured parity with  
Japan’s terms and retained its regulatory 
autonomy over digital services. The real  
problem, it argued, lies in Europe’s internal 
frictions—not in the asymmetry of the deal.
 
The EU’s negotiating position was weakened 
by internal divisions. France – which like  
the US runs a persistent trade deficit pushed 
back against agricultural concessions. Germany  
which runs a trade surplus - sought to protect 
its car industry. Eastern European states,  
who are most concerned with security guarantees, 
were reluctant to challenge Washington at all.  
The result was a fragmented front that 
left Brussels unwilling to push hard.
 
The corporate response to Trump’s tariff regime 
has been mixed. Ford reported a surprise quarterly  
loss in July, citing $800 million dollars 
in tariff-related costs and warning of a  
$2 billion dollar hit for the year. BMW, in 
contrast, has downplayed the fallout. With a major  
U.S. production base in South Carolina, it has 
been partially shielded from the worst effects. 
 
Apple – the company that has been most heavily 
hit by Trump’s trade and tariff agenda lost almost  
$700 billion dollars in market cap since the 
Liberation Day announcement posted blockbuster  
quarterly earnings this week. The companies CFO 
said there had been “some evidence” that sales  
were boosted by US customers buying early to 
get ahead of US tariffs early in the quarter.
 
Other sectors are also feeling the strain. 
Semiconductor firms have warned that the  
new tariffs could disrupt global supply chains 
already under pressure from export controls and  
geopolitical tensions. Pharmaceutical companies, 
many of which rely on Chinese active ingredients,  
are reassessing sourcing strategies. 
Trade associations have expressed concern about  
the lack of clarity in some deals. In several 
cases, tariff relief is tied to opaque “national  
security” reviews, leaving firms uncertain 
about compliance. Big businesses are delaying  
their investment decisions while they wait for 
guidance on how the new rules will be enforced.
 
While the Trump administration has 
touted a flurry of new trade “deals”,  
legal experts and lawmakers argue these are not 
actually real trade agreements. Under the U.S.  
Constitution, only Congress has the authority 
to regulate commerce with foreign nations and  
to approve binding trade agreements.
Instead, the administration has relied  
on executive agreements and emergency 
powers—particularly the International  
Emergency Economic Powers Act — to unilaterally 
impose tariffs and negotiate tariff adjustments.  
These arrangements, critics argue, lack legal 
standing and bypass the legislative process.
 
Senator Ron Wyden, the ranking member of the 
Senate Finance Committee, issued a rebuke last  
month in a letter to U.S. Trade Representative 
Jamieson Greer – saying - “The Constitution  
provides Congress with sole authority ‘to lay 
and collect . . . duties’ and ‘to regulate  
commerce with foreign nations’... The President 
lacks the authority to enter into binding trade  
agreements absent approval from Congress” 
He urged the administration to “respect  
Congress’s constitutional authority over trade and 
power to write U.S. law,” warning that continued  
circumvention could provoke legal challenges and 
undermine the legitimacy of U.S. trade policy.
 
While the Trump administration has framed 
its recent executive arrangements as trade  
“deals,” many of America’s trading partners 
are still treating them as provisional and  
politically contingent, rather than 
as binding international agreements.
 
Countries like the UK, Japan, and Vietnam have 
entered into what the White House calls “framework  
agreements” or “tariff understandings,” 
but these are not treaties ratified by  
legislatures. Instead, they are temporary 
arrangements negotiated under pressure,  
often in exchange for reduced tariffs or 
exemptions from broader U.S. measures.
 
European officials have been particularly 
cautious. A senior EU trade official, speaking  
anonymously, described the July 2025 agreement as 
“a tactical pause, not a strategic settlement.”  
Similarly, Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade 
and Industry issued a statement noting that  
its agreement with the U.S. “remains subject 
to further negotiation and domestic review” 
 
This ambiguity reflects a broader concern: 
that these deals could be reversed or  
invalidated by a change in Trumps mood, by 
U.S. courts or by a future administration.  
A federal appeals court is currently reviewing 
the legality of Trump’s use of emergency powers  
to impose sweeping tariffs, with analysts warning 
that the deals may ultimately be ruled “illegal” 
 
In effect, many countries are hedging their 
bets—accepting temporary agreements while  
preparing for further volatility. 
As one trade lawyer told CNN,  
“These aren’t trade deals. They’re ceasefires.”
The inflationary consequences of Trump’s tariffs  
are beginning to surface. While the US 
administration keeps claiming that other  
countries pay these tariffs, that 
is just not how they work. [Clip]
 
The tariffs push up the price of imported 
goods for American consumers – and can be  
expected to hurt foreign exporters – 
as the higher prices will likely lead  
to lower sales – but Americans do pay this tax.
Fed Chair Jay Powell – who was nominated by Donald  
Trump in 2018 has resisted the president’s 
calls for aggressive rate cuts. Powell cited  
uncertainty over the inflationary impact of 
tariffs, many of which exceed the 10% threshold  
economists had assumed would be the ceiling.
Two Fed governors dissented from the decision  
not to cut rates, marking the first such split 
since 1993. Markets interpreted Powell’s stance  
as hawkish, with short-term Treasury yields rising 
and the dollar rallying. Analysts at JPMorgan and  
Citigroup have warned that consumer spending 
could soften further in the second half of the  
year as businesses pass on higher input costs.
The inflationary impact is not limited to the  
U.S. European central banks are also monitoring 
the situation closely, with the ECB warning that  
higher U.S. tariffs could spill over into 
global prices. For now, the Fed is holding  
its ground—but the pressure is mounting.
One of the questions that must be asked,  
is what is Trumps overall goal with these 
tariffs? Is he hoping to strike deals—or  
hoping to use tariffs to raise revenue? The answer 
might be both. Trump has framed each agreement as  
a victory for American workers, but the deals 
also serve a fiscal function. Tariffs now  
generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue, 
effectively acting as a tax on imports. The deals  
are structured not just to rebalance trade flows, 
but to enforce a new geopolitical alignment—one  
in which access to the U.S. market may be 
contingent on distancing yourself from China.
 
Trump’s tariff policy has never been solely 
about correcting trade imbalances. While  
his rhetoric often invokes the language of 
economic nationalism—protecting American jobs,  
reviving domestic manufacturing—the pattern of his 
actions suggests a broader, more coercive use of  
trade tools. The tariffs on Mexico and Canada were 
widely seen as a demonstration of power rather  
than a response to specific economic grievances.
Nowhere is this clearer than in Trump’s move  
against Brazil. The administration announced a 
50% tariff on Brazilian aluminum and agricultural  
exports, not in response to trade practices, 
but as retaliation for Brazil’s prosecution of  
former president Jair Bolsonaro. Trump denounced 
the Brazilian legal proceedings as politically  
motivated and accused Brazil’s judiciary of 
suppressing free speech. This episode underscores  
how tariffs under Trump have become instruments 
of ideological alignment and personal loyalty,  
rather than just as tools of economic policy.
Trump’s approach has significant implications  
for the global trading system. It undermines 
the WTO’s most-favored-nation principle,  
which requires countries to treat all trading 
partners equally and avoid discrimination. By  
offering preferential terms to allies who 
accept U.S. conditions—and penalizing those  
who do not—Trump is replacing multilateralism 
with a confusing array of bilateral deals.
 
While tariffs are often framed as tools of 
trade policy, they also function as a form  
of taxation. According to estimates from Yale’s 
Budget Lab, the U.S. is now collecting tariffs on  
nearly half of all imports and bringing in tens 
of billions of dollars in revenue annually.
 
A government can bring in tax revenue however 
it wants and Trump has paired sweeping income  
tax cuts with these tariffs, effectively 
shifting part of the federal revenue burden  
from domestic earners to consumers of imported 
goods. This raises the question of whether  
this an efficient way to collect revenue? 
Economists generally argue that tariffs are a  
distortionary and regressive form of taxation, 
raising prices for consumers and disrupting  
supply chains—compared to more transparent 
mechanisms like income tax. Yet for Trump,  
tariffs offer a politically potent blend of 
revenue generation and nationalist signaling.
 
Trump’s tariff blitz is an attempt to reorder 
global trade around American leverage. Americas  
allies have been drawn into a new system 
of conditional market access, where tariff  
rates are tied to compliance with U.S. strategic 
objectives. China, meanwhile, is recalibrating its  
supply chains and diplomatic posture in response.
For businesses, the message is clear: the era of  
frictionless global trade is over. Supply chains 
are being redrawn, investment decisions are being  
delayed, and the cost of doing business across 
borders is rising. It is not at all obvious that  
these deals are set in stone – they might well 
be renegotiated constantly in the coming years. 
 
While something did need to be done about 
America’s persistent trade imbalances, and  
there are good arguments for moving strategically 
important manufacturing onshore, the question  
remains whether the current approach—marked by 
sweeping and frequently shifting tariffs—is the  
right one. Tariffs can raise revenue, and Trump 
has used them to offset income tax cuts, but they  
are a very blunt instrument. They distort prices, 
disrupt supply chains, and create uncertainty for  
businesses and consumers alike. Imported goods 
often spend 45 days at sea before reaching  
U.S. ports, and with tariff rates changing 
unpredictably, importers are left guessing at  
final costs—undermining planning and investment.
On top of that, it is far from clear that tariffs  
will achieve their stated goal of reviving 
American manufacturing. China’s manufacturing  
workforce alone numbers over 220 million—more 
than the entire U.S. labor force—and with American  
unemployment near historic lows, there is limited 
slack to absorb large-scale reshoring. As Robert  
Armstrong rightly observed in a recent podcast – 
which I’ll link to in the description - history  
suggests that protectionism tends to lead to 
lower productivity and stifles innovation.  
It invites rule-bending and rent-seeking, rather 
than competition and excellence. If the goal is  
to strengthen the U.S. economy, then the tools 
must be chosen with care—and wielded with a clear  
understanding of their long-term consequences.
