[Music]


So,
 hi.
 Hi
 everybody.
 Uh,
 my
 name
 is


Ching
 Kyong
 Lamb.
 Um,
 I'm
 the
 founder


and
 CEO
 of
 PO.AI.


Uh,
 a
 bit
 background
 about
 my
 company.


uh
 PTO
 AI
 started
 two
 years
 ago
 with
 a


invitation
 from
 National
 Science


Foundation
 from
 the
 SBIR
 grant
 funding


investigating
 LLM.
 We
 did
 a
 LMB
 driven


drug
 discovery
 application.
 Uh
 since


then
 we
 branch
 out
 to
 leverage
 what
 we


learned
 about
 building
 AI
 system
 for


large
 corporation.
 We
 are
 currently


building
 expert
 AI
 system
 for
 several


clients.
 Currently
 the
 system
 we
 build


goes
 beyond
 rack
 system.
 Um
 many
 of
 our


client
 is
 asking
 for
 AI
 system
 that


perform
 task
 like
 research
 and
 advisory


role
 based
 on
 their
 area
 of
 interest.
 Uh


today
 the
 talk
 is
 about
 sharing
 with
 our


fellow
 AI
 engineer
 what
 we
 learned
 so


far
 building
 this
 kind
 of
 system.
 Okay.


Uh
 what
 is
 knowledge?
 Okay.
 Generally


philosophically
 I
 say
 knowledge
 is
 the


understanding
 and
 awareness
 gained


through
 experience,
 education
 and
 the


comprehension
 of
 facts
 and
 principle.


And
 that
 lead
 to
 the
 next
 question
 is


what
 is
 knowledge
 graph?
 Right?
 So


knowledge
 graph
 is
 a
 systematic
 method


of
 preserving
 wisdom
 by
 connecting
 them


and
 creating
 a
 network
 or
 interconnect


relationship.
 That's
 important.
 The


graph
 represent
 the
 thought
 process


and
 comprehensive
 tonomy
 of
 a
 specific


domain
 of
 expertise.
 That's
 why
 this
 is


is
 very
 important
 for
 people
 moving


forward
 is
 about
 AI
 system
 then
 think
 a


lot
 and
 return
 uh
 advice
 instead
 of
 just


retrieve
 you
 know
 data
 from
 your


database
 right
 so
 that
 comes
 to
 the


development
 of
 this
 uh
 K
 a
 okay
 what
 is


K
 a
 kag
 stand
 for
 knowledge
 augment


generations
 and
 it's
 different
 from
 rack


okay
 it
 is
 enhanced
 language
 model
 by


integrating
 structure
 knowledge
 graph


for
 more
 accurate
 and
 insightful
 respond


making
 needs
 smarter
 more
 structural


approach
 than
 a
 simple
 rack.
 K
 a
 doesn't


just
 retrieve
 remember
 it
 understand


this
 is
 different


okay
 after
 in
 interviewing
 a
 lot
 of
 my


client
 okay
 so
 or
 we
 also
 expert
 in
 a


certain
 area
 of
 scale
 I
 found
 that
 there


are
 common
 ways
 of
 their
 thinking


decision
 making
 process
 the
 way
 that


make
 them
 expert
 in
 their
 area
 knowledge


graph
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 perfect
 fit
 so
 here


is
 the
 graph
 or
 state
 diagram
 if
 you're


a
 computer
 engineering
 grad
 like
 So
 um


it
 shows
 a
 wisdom
 the
 the
 wisdom
 note
 as


you
 can
 see
 is
 the
 is
 a
 core
 right
 it's


wisdom
 it
 just
 isn't
 static
 it
 actively


guide
 decision
 and
 fused
 by
 other


element


the
 output
 from
 the
 wisdom
 actually
 goes


to
 decision
 making
 in
 the
 blue
 right


wisdom
 isn't
 passive
 it
 guide
 decision


helping
 us
 choose
 wisely
 Okay.
 And
 then


the
 decision
 making
 analyze
 the


situation
 given
 in
 the
 circle
 in
 the
 uh


green
 and
 decision
 aren't
 make
 you
 know


in
 a
 vacuum.
 Okay.
 They
 analyze
 real


world
 situation.
 That's
 the
 difference.


Okay.
 So
 look
 at
 the
 wisdom
 input.
 Okay.


Look
 at
 the
 relationship
 feedback
 from


the
 knowledge
 to
 wisdom
 in
 gold
 color.


Example
 of
 that
 is
 knowledge
 to
 wisdom


like
 all
 your
 books
 smart
 and


encyclopedia
 Wikipedia
 whatever
 you


store
 plus
 once
 that
 data
 get
 absorbed


by
 whatever
 model
 you
 use
 up
 there
 it


need
 to
 regurgitate
 that
 and
 understand


that's
 why
 it's
 very
 important
 that


wisdom
 is
 able
 to
 synthesize
 the
 data


after
 you
 ingested
 knowledge
 okay
 that's


a
 kind
 of
 abstract
 but
 I
 I'll
 come
 come


to
 that
 later
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about


okay
 from
 Insight
 example
 of
 that
 is


wisdom
 derive
 pattern
 from
 chaos
 like


some
 of
 my
 client
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 social


media
 they
 their
 product
 how
 do
 they
 you


know
 track
 their
 product
 sediment
 from


from
 social
 media
 right
 so
 it's
 okay


chaotic
 and
 from
 ax
 tweet
 right
 so
 so


from
 that
 you
 can
 see
 some
 pattern
 of


their
 competitor
 versus
 uh
 current
 what


my
 product
 is
 that
 that's
 like
 an


example
 of
 that
 and
 I
 will
 go
 to
 that


later
 okay
 when
 all
 these
 connected


notes
 matter
 together
 why
 do
 they
 matter


matter
 all
 the
 notes
 relate
 to
 one


another
 to
 ever
 inre
 um
 enriching
 wisdom


storing
 system.
 Okay,
 this
 talk
 is
 about


storing
 wisdom,
 right?
 So
 knowledge


tells
 you
 what
 it
 is,
 right?
 And


experience
 tell
 you
 what
 worked
 before.


Insight
 invent
 what
 to
 try
 next,
 right?


Like
 a
 pizza
 knowledge
 is
 recipe.


Experience
 is
 knowing
 your
 oven
 burn


crust
 inside
 is
 like
 hey
 it
 is
 adding


you
 know
 honey
 to
 the
 crust
 you
 make


caramelize
 perfectly.
 Right?
 So
 the
 most


important
 part
 of
 the
 knowledge
 graph
 is


feedback
 loop.
 Okay,
 feedback
 isn't


oneway
 street.
 It
 learn
 from
 itself.


Look
 at
 the
 feedback
 from
 the
 uh
 going


back
 to
 all
 the
 note
 from
 insight
 to


wisdom.
 Okay.
 Um
 situation
 inform
 future


wisdom.
 Experience
 deepen
 it
 insight


sharpen
 it.
 Like
 a
 tree
 growing
 roots,


the
 more
 effect
 the
 stronger
 it
 get.
 Now


I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 in
 general.


Where
 do
 you
 see
 this
 circle
 in
 your


life?
 Maybe
 a
 tough
 decision
 that
 you


know
 taught
 you
 something.


So
 one
 practical
 application
 for


leadership
 is
 wisdom.
 Avoid
 knee
 jack


reaction
 by
 learning
 from
 feedback.
 As


for
 personal
 growth,
 ever
 notice
 how


past
 mistake
 make
 you
 wiser?
 That's
 the


loop
 in
 the
 action.
 All
 this.
 So
 the


take
 away
 from
 the
 slide
 in
 this
 is


wisdom
 isn't
 a
 trophy
 you
 learn earn
 it


is
 a
 muscle
 you
 exercise
 the
 more
 you


feed
 knowledge
 experience
 inside
 the


more
 that
 guide
 you
 now
 I
 will
 show
 you


how
 it
 being
 mapped
 to
 my
 current
 client


you
 know
 all
 this
 is
 like
 very
 abstract


right
 so
 how
 I
 one
 of
 my
 clients


actually
 doing
 a
 competitive
 analysis
 uh


they
 used
 to
 have
 a
 marketing
 department


doing
 that
 but
 they
 want
 AI
 to
 do
 Yeah,


right.
 They
 they
 ask
 me
 to
 build
 the


system.
 This
 is
 exactly
 what
 I
 did
 with


the
 same
 taxonomy
 of
 storing
 all
 this.


So
 this
 taxonomy
 will
 be
 later
 on
 I
 talk


about
 how
 multi-
 aent
 is
 going
 to
 handle


all
 that.
 Here
 is
 one
 of
 the
 chatbot


that
 I
 build
 for
 my
 client
 to
 do
 you


know
 not
 just
 some
 uh
 we
 not
 just
 some


chatbot
 okay
 it's
 our
 wisdom
 graph
 power


AI
 designed
 to
 turn
 data
 into
 strategy


right
 dominant.
 So
 what
 kind
 of
 question


I
 talk
 about
 talk
 about
 how
 do
 I
 win
 my


competitor
 in
 this
 market
 space
 that's


kind
 of
 very
 sophisticated
 question


right
 so
 without
 uh
 if
 you
 do
 simply


just
 right
 by
 first
 speaker
 talk
 about


right
 right
 so
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 cut
 it


they're
 not
 going
 to
 able
 to
 answer
 that


kind
 of
 question
 okay
 what
 I
 did
 is
 this


uh
 we
 retain
 the
 same
 tonomy
 and
 uh
 the


wisdom
 is
 then
 mapped
 the
 same
 engine


here
 the
 wisdom
 engine
 wisdom
 engine
 is


like
 a
 orchestration
 agent
 that
 does
 a


lot
 of
 decision
 making
 including


advising
 what
 the
 ARM
 is
 able
 to
 see
 bas


on
 the
 current
 situation
 what
 to
 do
 next


right
 so
 um
 what
 I
 did
 is
 uh
 for
 the
 uh


decision
 making
 I
 map
 it
 to
 a
 strategy


generator
 so
 these
 customers
 are
 talking


about
 a
 competitive
 analysis
 right
 so
 um


I
 map
 the
 knowledge
 in
 term
 of
 knowledge


what
 do
 they
 have
 they
 have
 market
 data


right
 so
 I
 map
 this
 experience
 to
 HP
 is


one
 of
 a
 kind
 past
 campaign
 so
 they
 have


a
 lot
 of
 campaign
 doing
 a
 lot
 of


marketing
 and
 then
 um
 the
 insight
 is


actually
 mapped
 to
 uh
 in
 industrial


insight
 they
 have
 a
 database
 doing


storing
 that
 and
 then
 of
 course
 the
 most


important
 is
 is
 the
 the
 situation
 the


situation
 is
 how
 how
 am
 I
 doing
 how
 my


product
 selling
 right
 so
 so
 that
 that
 is


like
 a
 situation
 and
 then
 I
 map
 that
 to


a
 competitor
 weakness
 that
 means
 they


say
 if
 you
 make
 the
 aware
 of
 that
 you


probably
 get
 a
 very
 good
 answer
 and
 then


the
 chatbot
 will
 probably
 be
 doing
 the


right
 thing
 advising
 so
 from
 here
 very


high
 level
 you
 know
 state
 diagram
 or


there
 how
 do
 I
 map
 it
 to
 a
 system
 that


drive
 well
 here
 comes
 the
 trick
 so


anybody
 here
 heard
 of
 n


all
 right
 all
 right
 it's
 all
 good
 so
 so


I
 I
 first
 encounter
 similar
 situation


when
 my
 past
 IoT
 project
 which
 is
 not


red
 developed
 by
 uh
 IBM
 right
 so
 it's


the
 same
 kind
 of
 thing
 it's
 like
 no
 code


but
 but
 underneath
 the
 hood
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 code
 okay
 it's
 all
 nodejs
 code


okay
 so
 uh
 but
 but
 for
 the
 for
 for
 for


proving
 your
 concept
 and
 all
 that
 it's


very
 very
 very
 flexible
 and
 I
 I
 highly


recommend
 that
 and
 and and
 here
 here
 you


can
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 the
 workflow
 the


work
 from
 I
 enable
 the
 implementation
 of


this
 complicated
 state
 diagram
 with
 um


what
 I
 say
 is
 there
 is
 a
 different


community
 note
 one
 of
 the
 very
 powerful


node
 is
 AI
 agent
 well
 previously
 N
 is


just
 a
 workflow
 automation
 tool
 I'm
 not


selling
 for
 N
 here
 I'm
 just
 telling
 you


I'm
 using
 it
 uh
 for
 pro
 prototyping


further
 down
 the
 road
 maybe
 the
 client


say
 too
 like
 I
 I
 really
 need
 to
 you
 know


go
 lightweight
 maybe
 we
 will
 switch
 over


to
 some
 other
 lang
 chain
 or
 whatever
 but


uh
 we
 actually
 uses
 like
 I
 mapped
 the


previous
 uh
 state
 diagram
 from
 the


wisdom
 engine
 I
 actually
 map
 that
 to
 our


uh
 wisdom
 agent
 okay
 wisdom
 agent
 is
 now


have
 the
 option
 to
 drive
 uh
 different


model
 like
 openai
 model
 entropic
 model


and
 even
 onrem
 model
 and
 then
 that
 the


key
 in
 making
 the
 state
 m
 the
 state


machine
 work
 is
 that
 my
 wisdom
 agent
 is


now
 overseeing
 like
 a
 supervisory
 agent


or
 all
 these
 other
 agent
 that
 do
 uh


whatever
 I
 say
 on
 the
 state
 diagram
 like


um
 for
 example
 the
 uh
 state
 of
 uh
 going


into
 a
 note
 of
 insight
 inside
 agent
 will


test
 to
 do
 go
 to
 the
 social
 media
 look


for
 all
 the
 settlement
 of
 all
 your


product
 and
 then
 collect
 that
 and
 then


pump
 that
 you
 can
 see
 that
 at
 the
 dot


bottom
 that
 we
 I
 connected
 to
 a


a
 centralized
 uh
 graph
 left
 the
 central


graph
 will
 be
 able
 to
 get
 updated
 by


different
 agent
 uh
 inside
 agent
 will


update
 the
 their
 perspective
 like
 part


of
 that
 graph
 for
 the
 uh
 as
 I
 say
 for


this
 particular
 uh
 inside
 note.
 So,
 so


all
 the
 unified
 knowledge
 graph
 will


contain
 the
 taxonomy
 that
 eventually


just
 think
 like
 the
 marketing
 strategies


the
 way
 that
 here
 they
 will
 probably
 if


you
 are
 doing
 manually
 they
 probably


would
 think
 in
 your
 shareepoint
 will
 all


this
 you
 know
 folder
 will
 store
 the
 same


kind
 of
 uh
 you
 know
 wisdom
 I
 call
 it
 to


make
 decision
 based
 on
 that.
 So
 the
 the


final
 decision
 is
 LM
 also
 depend
 on
 the


model
 that
 you
 use.
 Uh
 but
 I
 I
 I
 I


pretty
 much
 think
 that
 not
 really
 the


way
 that
 I
 think
 the
 final
 decision
 come


when
 you
 make
 a
 right
 decision
 from
 the


advisor
 output
 is
 basically
 depend
 on


all
 the
 tonomy
 the
 graph
 structure


that's
 very
 important.
 So
 come
 to
 that
 I


I
 want
 to
 go
 deep
 down
 how
 I
 implement


one
 of
 the
 node
 uh
 just
 to
 go
 a
 bit


technical
 on
 this
 competitive
 node.
 How


do
 I
 implement
 that?
 Okay,
 before
 I
 do


that,
 okay,
 competitive
 analysis,
 right?


Why
 why
 you
 can
 actually
 just
 use
 rag?


Why
 do
 you
 want
 to
 use
 a
 knowledge
 graph


like
 new
 forj?
 Well,
 if
 you
 ever
 being


asked
 that
 question,
 tell
 them
 these


five
 uh
 five
 reason.
 Okay,
 first
 reason


is
 knowledge
 graph
 you
 know
 u
 system


excel
 at
 capturing
 and
 representing


complex
 relationship
 between
 entities


that
 is
 covered
 by
 the
 first
 speaker
 but


I'll
 just
 reiterate
 that
 this
 lead
 to
 a


deeper
 contextual
 understanding
 which
 is


crucial
 for
 comparative
 analysis
 where


this
 in
 this
 case
 the
 insight
 can
 be


significant
 different
 okay
 you
 want
 to


find
 the
 gap
 in
 your
 computer
 winners


this
 is
 very
 important
 the
 second
 is


improve
 accuracy
 by
 leveraging


structured
 data
 and
 semantics


relationship
 knowledge
 graph
 can
 provide


more
 accurate
 and
 relevant
 information


compared
 to
 traditional
 vector
 racks.
 Um


this
 ensure
 generated
 content
 is
 not


only
 relevant
 but
 also
 precise
 and


reduce
 the
 noise
 and
 improve
 decision


making
 making
 this
 in
 this
 case
 the


board
 is
 supposed
 to
 help
 the
 guy
 that


is
 marketing
 department
 make
 decisions.


So,
 so
 you
 better
 make
 this
 work
 improve


accuracy.
 Any
 inaccurate
 data,
 you
 will


be
 out
 of
 the
 contract,
 out
 of
 the
 door,


right?
 So,
 very
 important.
 Okay,
 you're


talking
 about
 contract
 work
 like
 me,
 I


have
 to
 make
 the
 rack
 as
 accurate
 as


possible.
 So,
 the
 third
 is
 scalability


and
 flexibility.
 There
 graphic
 you
 know


graph
 are
 incredibly
 scalable
 and
 can


integrate
 to
 new
 data
 source
 and


relationship.
 The
 flexibility
 allow
 the


continuous
 improvement.
 As
 I
 say,
 if


your
 taxonomy
 is
 correct,
 you
 will


continues
 to
 improve
 and
 and
 reach,


right?
 So,
 so
 that
 is
 important
 and
 also


rich
 query
 capability.
 Knowledge
 craft


support
 complex
 query
 traverse
 to


multiple
 relationship
 entity
 provide


richer
 and
 more
 detailed
 insight.
 This


is
 particularly
 advantage
 for


competitive
 analysis
 when
 multifacet


query
 like
 like
 what
 the
 first
 speaker


say
 it
 is
 super
 a
 notoriously
 good
 in


answering
 things
 that
 normal
 rack
 will


fail.
 It's
 like
 multihop
 question.
 Okay,


this
 is
 very
 important.
 And
 then
 the


final
 one
 is
 the
 enhanced
 data


integration.
 Uh
 knowledge
 graph
 can


seamlessly
 integrate
 diverse
 data
 source


pictures,
 graphics,
 videos.
 Uh
 however


it
 is
 now
 that
 LM
 is
 so
 powerful
 we
 have


OCR
 capability
 can
 do
 that
 as
 long
 as


you
 have
 a
 right
 structure
 of
 the
 graph


semistructure
 unstructured
 the
 holistic


approach
 ensure
 compressive
 view
 of
 the


competitive
 landscape
 enable
 more


informed
 strategic
 decision
 making.


Okay.
 So
 one
 of
 the
 this
 is
 I'm
 going
 to


just
 very
 briefly
 go
 through
 this
 just
 a


uh
 example
 of
 that
 some
 of
 the
 thing


like
 um
 problem
 of
 a
 vectors
 rack
 you


know
 vector
 rack
 is
 really
 really
 bad
 in


answering
 limited
 numerical
 resing


vector
 store
 excel
 you
 know
 at
 sematic


sim
 similarity
 but
 struggle
 with
 complex


numerical
 calculation
 this
 is
 why
 uh
 for


marketing
 analysis
 uh
 that
 I'm
 building


the
 chatbot
 for
 uh
 they
 actually
 rely
 on


number
 instead
 of
 just
 you
 know


returning


example
 like
 this
 kind
 of
 if
 you
 ask


like
 what
 is
 the
 Apple
 uh
 revenue
 uh


between
 uh
 two
 uh
 you
 know
 what's
 the


revenue
 in
 2022
 they
 probably
 will
 give


you
 a
 bunch
 of
 this
 kind
 of
 a
 passage


right
 retrieve
 a
 graph
 instead
 of
 uh


this
 kind
 of
 a
 very
 very
 precise
 thing


like
 uh
 the
 answer
 is
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 got


knowledge
 cross
 able
 because
 the
 the


data
 is
 already
 there
 in
 structure
 form


the
 data
 source
 assume
 a
 knowledge
 gra


name
 this
 particular
 in
 this
 particular


case
 Apple
 financial
 data
 the
 query
 will


be
 able
 the
 query
 engine
 will
 be
 able
 to


select
 the
 the
 revenue
 figure
 from
 2021


to
 2022
 and
 and
 then
 do
 a
 function
 call


the
 function
 call
 will
 eventually
 give


come
 out
 with
 15.23
 23
 which
 is
 exactly


what
 the
 marketing
 guy
 was
 looking
 for
 a


very
 quantitative
 stuff
 that
 most
 of
 the


decision
 were
 based
 on
 that
 because
 you


have
 the
 evidence
 not
 just
 some
 passage


that
 you
 retrieve
 from
 the
 data
 it's


basically
 evidence
 based
 decision
 making


is
 very
 important
 for
 this
 kind
 of
 uh


complicated
 rack
 system
 that
 you
 know
 so


um
 there's
 a
 jungle
 out
 there
 right
 now


you
 can
 use
 different
 kind
 of
 a
 uh
 uh
 uh


thing
 to
 build
 your
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 this


is
 just
 a
 snapshot
 of
 that
 you
 know
 you


can
 actually
 use
 lang
 chain
 plus
 chroma


to
 to
 build
 your
 own
 rack
 and
 then
 you


also
 can
 combine
 that
 with
 your


knowledge
 graph
 depend
 on
 on
 on
 your


user
 case.
 Okay,
 if
 if
 this
 this
 slide


show
 that
 the
 rack
 and
 the
 k
 a
 can
 be
 bu


with
 money.
 Okay,
 I
 adopt
 that
 wisdom


graph
 in
 red
 color.
 Normally
 you
 will


see
 if
 client
 is
 just
 asking
 for
 a


simple
 rack
 that
 perform
 product


information
 query,
 you
 can
 just
 use
 a


simple
 chroma
 DB
 with
 LM
 agent.
 And
 if


you
 start
 to
 ask
 so
 complicated


questions
 like
 how
 can
 I
 beat
 my


competition
 based
 on
 my
 current
 market


share.
 Well,
 this
 will
 be
 able
 the
 the


the
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 will
 probably
 be


adopting
 is
 knowledge
 graph
 here
 with
 uh


graph
 DB
 plus
 cipher
 query
 and
 then
 qua


and
 also
 train
 my
 rack
 to
 perform


several
 loop
 of
 uh
 we
 call
 multihop


query
 and
 this
 probably
 will
 give
 you
 a


very
 good
 answer.


So
 uh
 and
 then
 it
 come
 to
 the
 another


question
 when
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 extract
 my


uh
 oh
 I
 think
 my
 time
 is
 uh
 is
 almost


up.
 Okay.
 So
 anyway
 this
 is
 like
 to
 say


uh
 the
 first
 speaker
 talk
 about
 the


extraction
 right
 there's
 a
 very
 simple


way
 to
 extract
 on
 the
 right
 side
 is
 like


automated
 totally
 automated
 LM
 graph


transformer
 on
 the
 left
 is
 like
 manual
 I


would
 probably
 re
 recommend
 to
 send
 the


hybrid
 model
 which
 is
 like
 after
 you
 use


the
 LM
 to
 extract
 your
 graph
 you
 ask
 the


interview
 the
 the
 expert
 that
 you're


going
 to
 build
 uh
 to
 to
 build
 your


taxonomy
 right
 to
 prone
 the
 graph
 we


call
 it
 proning
 your
 graph
 remove
 a
 lot


of
 relationship
 that
 then
 that
 that
 will


be
 okay
 and
 um
 I
 will
 try
 to
 just


highlight
 like
 this
 this
 is
 the
 result


of
 benchmark
 that
 we
 did
 okay
 anybody


ask
 you
 you
 know
 why
 you
 want
 to
 use


graph
 right
 or
 k
 a
 okay
 first
 is


accuracy
 I
 had
 achieved
 91%
 because
 it's


really
 good
 in
 extract
 structure
 second


is
 flexibility
 85%
 third
 is
 repubity


reproducibility
 deterministic
 and
 then


the
 fourth
 one
 traceability
 and
 finally


uh
 most
 important
 is
 scalability
 so
 in


conclusion


by
 leveraging
 structure
 nature
 of


western
 knowledge
 We
 can
 significantly


enhance
 the
 quantitative
 capability
 of
 K


a
 system
 and
 a
 more
 accurate
 and


insightful
 respond
 to
 complex
 query
 by


using
 wisdom-driven
 system
 as


highlighted.
 Together
 we
 can
 build


smarter
 AI
 system
 that
 can
 scale
 and


store
 wisdom
 with
 the
 right
 framing


potentially
 surpass
 the
 intelligent
 of


the
 initial
 expert
 that
 we
 meant
 to


serve.
 So
 uh
 talk
 to
 Jesus.
 You
 know


what
 do
 they
 just
 do?
 Talk
 to
 Jesus.


He's
 in
 our
 in
 in
 a
 not
 booth.
 this
 my


good
 friend
 and
 uh
 anybody
 that
 want
 to


build
 graph
 we
 have
 a
 good
 uh
 so-called


LLM
 graph
 rack
 stack
 on
 GitHub
 that
 is


sponsored
 by
 new
 forj
 and
 out
 of
 the
 box


just
 spin
 up
 your
 docker
 the
 next
 thing


you
 know
 your
 text
 is
 going
 to
 be


converted
 to
 your
 graph
 and
 you
 can


start
 happy
 pruning
 your
 graph
 thank
 you


thank
 you
 so


[Applause]
