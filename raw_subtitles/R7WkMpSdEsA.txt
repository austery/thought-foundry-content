Hi
 everybody,
 I'm
 Steve
 Pacin
 and
 we
 are


here
 on
 the
 site
 of
 the
 former
 Royal


Canadian
 Air
 Force
 Station
 Downs
 View


for
 the
 first
 edition
 of
 TVO
 Today
 Live


for
 2026.


This
 is
 hangar
 A
 of
 the
 Bombardier


Center
 for
 Aerospace
 and
 Aviation
 at


Centennial
 Colleg's
 dedicated
 aerospace


campus.
 It's
 all
 part
 of
 the
 DAREHub,
 D


AIR,
 Downs
 View
 Aerospace
 Innovation
 and


Research.
 And
 we
 are
 here
 because
 in


what
 seems
 like
 an
 increasingly


dangerous
 world,
 Canada
 is
 revitalizing


and
 restoring
 its
 military.
 This
 site


once
 cranked
 out
 dehavlin
 moths
 and


mosquitoes
 for
 World
 War
 II
 Allied


forces
 and
 was
 an
 active
 RCAF
 base
 right


up
 until
 the
 1990s.
 For
 decades,
 Canada


punched
 well
 above
 its
 weight


militarily.
 That
 waned
 as
 funding
 and


frankly
 interest
 shrank.
 Now,
 with


billions
 reallocated
 to
 rearm
 and
 revive


it,
 what
 kind
 of
 fighting
 force
 can
 and


should
 Canada
 have,
 and
 how
 do
 we
 equip


for
 that
 mission?
 Before
 we
 start,
 I


want
 to
 say
 thank
 you
 to
 Red
 Wilson.
 He


heads
 up
 the
 Wilson
 Foundation.
 Ever


since
 this
 TVO
 Today
 live
 series
 began,


Red
 Wilson
 has
 been
 there
 for
 us,


offering
 us
 the
 support
 and
 funding
 we


need
 to
 do
 these
 programs.
 So,
 Sheldon,


take
 a
 shot
 of
 everybody
 here.
 We
 got
 an


overflow
 crowd
 on
 the
 bleachers
 at
 the


back
 there
 and
 everybody
 gets
 in
 for


free
 because
 Red
 Wilson
 is
 underwriting


this
 whole
 effort.
 So,
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 that.
 And
 we
 are
 also
 happy
 as
 well


to
 thank
 the
 Jackman
 Foundation
 which


has
 now
 come
 aboard
 and
 their
 additional


support
 is
 most
 welcomed
 as
 well.
 Now,


we
 are
 delighted
 to
 have
 with
 us
 for


this
 conversation
 today,
 General
 Wayne


Heir,
 retired
 Canadian
 Air
 Force's


officer
 with
 more
 than
 30
 years
 in
 the


service
 and
 among
 several
 distinguished


commands
 and
 deployments,
 was
 chief
 of


Canada's
 defense
 staff
 from
 2021
 to
 24.


Wendy
 Gilmore,
 who
 for
 more
 than
 three


decades
 served
 in
 Canada's
 foreign


affairs
 and
 national
 defense


departments,
 including
 at
 NATO
 as


assistant
 secretary
 general
 for
 defense


investment.
 and
 Christian
 Lipre,


professor
 at
 the
 Royal
 Military
 College


of
 Canada
 and
 Queens
 University
 and
 the


editor
 most
 recently
 of
 Military


Operations
 in
 Response
 to
 domestic


emergencies
 and
 global
 pandemics.
 And


how
 about
 this
 audience
 welcoming
 our


guests
 here
 today.
 Thank
 you
 for
 coming


in.


The
 impetus
 for
 this
 program
 was
 a
 huge


bump
 in
 defense
 spending
 announced
 in


the
 last
 federal
 budget.
 An
 $81
 billion


funding
 package
 for
 the
 Canadian
 Armed


Forces.
 And
 I
 introduced
 you
 as
 Air


Force.
 I
 meant
 to
 say
 armed
 force.


Canadian
 Armed
 Forces.


>> I
 wasn't
 going
 to
 correct
 you,
 Steve.


>> You
 should
 have
 corrected
 me,
 but
 as


soon
 as
 the
 word
 came
 out
 of
 my
 mouth,
 I


thought
 that
 doesn't
 sound
 right.


Anyway,
 Canadian
 Armed
 Forces,
 including


a
 byanadian
 procurement
 program.
 But


before
 we
 even
 get
 to
 that,
 for
 many


people,
 there's
 an
 elephant
 in
 the
 room.


There's
 a
 lot
 of
 planes
 in
 the
 room,
 but


there's
 an
 elephant,
 too.
 Perhaps
 shaped


like
 Venezuela
 or
 Greenland.
 So,
 let
 us


begin
 with
 the,
 what
 shall
 we
 call
 it,


infuriating
 relationship
 we
 are


currently
 having
 with
 our
 neighbors
 to


the
 south.
 General,
 when
 you
 were
 the


CDS
 Chief
 of
 Defense
 Staff,
 you


underscored
 that
 whatever
 peace
 and


security
 exists
 in
 the
 world
 is
 thanks


to
 an
 agreed
 upon
 international


rules-based
 order.
 According
 to
 our


prime
 minister,
 that's
 done.
 It's
 over


with.
 How
 concerning
 is
 that
 for
 our


military?


>> Well,
 it
 should
 be
 very
 concerning.
 And


we've
 seen
 this
 coming
 for
 some
 time.
 In


fact,
 in
 2022,
 I
 said
 publicly
 that
 we


were
 at
 a
 turning
 point
 in
 that
 global


order.
 And
 what
 we
 see
 coming
 from
 south


of
 the
 border
 is
 an
 accelerant
 uh
 to


that
 that
 turning
 point.
 Hey,
 let's
 face


it,
 all
 um
 global
 orders
 come
 and
 go.


We've
 seen
 this
 for
 5
 6
 700
 years.
 But


it's
 a
 period
 or
 it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


cycle
 of
 order,
 disorder,
 reorder.
 We


are
 entering
 the
 disorder
 phase
 and


until
 we
 find
 a
 new
 equilibrium,
 uh


there
 is
 tremendous
 opportunity
 for


miscalculation


and
 and
 bad
 things
 to
 happen.
 Wendy


Gilmore,
 how
 should
 we
 react
 to
 this


moment
 in
 our
 collective
 history?


>> I
 tend
 to
 think
 of
 the
 British
 adage
 for


keep
 calm
 and
 carry
 on.
 We
 have
 to


understand
 what's
 going
 on.
 We
 have
 to


react
 as
 uh
 as
 calmly
 as
 possible
 to


events,
 statements
 from
 President
 Trump


in
 the
 south,
 international
 events
 at


large,
 changes
 in
 the
 world
 trading


order,
 they
 will
 all
 impact
 Canada.
 But


what
 is
 most
 important
 is
 that
 we
 focus


on
 getting
 our
 own
 internal
 processes


right
 and
 that
 we
 remain
 as
 resilient
 as


we
 can.


>> How
 do
 we
 keep
 calm
 in
 the
 face
 of
 all


of
 that?


>> Well,
 my
 personal
 opinion
 is
 that
 if


you're
 faced
 with
 a
 bully,
 you
 stand
 up


and
 you
 say
 what
 is
 right
 and
 you
 try


and
 uh
 calibrate
 your
 approach
 to
 taking


into
 account
 you're
 protecting
 your
 own


interests.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 we
 have


to
 be
 aware,
 especially
 when
 our


relationship
 with
 the
 Americans
 is


concerned,
 is
 that
 we're
 not
 putting
 up


a
 wall.
 They're
 not
 going
 away.
 We
 have


to
 find
 a
 way
 to
 work
 with
 an


administration,
 even
 if
 we
 may
 not
 be


completely
 aligned
 or
 aligned
 at
 all
 in


what
 it
 is
 that
 they're
 doing
 right
 now.


>> Christian,
 your
 view.


>> So,
 look,
 this
 is
 the
 250th
 anniversary


of
 George
 Washington
 during
 the


revolutionary
 wars
 with
 his
 armies


through
 St.
 Johnu
 marching
 on
 Quebec


City
 where
 he
 was
 of
 course
 beaten
 back


by
 British
 troops.
 War
 of
 1812,
 Oregon


boundary
 dispute.
 We
 think
 back
 to
 the


Nixon
 era.
 Look,
 the
 relationship
 with


the
 United
 States
 has
 always
 been


difficult.
 And
 it's
 been
 difficult
 for


two
 reasons.
 One
 is
 that
 the
 United


States
 has
 always
 been
 unilateral
 and
 it


asserts
 its
 interests
 and
 it
 has
 long


asserted
 its
 security
 interests


unilaterally
 in
 the
 hemisphere.
 going


back
 to
 the
 uh
 to
 the
 Monroe
 Doctrine.


The
 other
 is
 that
 if
 you
 think
 back
 to


Arthur
 Slesinger's
 1973
 book,
 the


imperial
 presidency,
 we've
 long
 seen
 an


expansion
 of
 executive
 power
 in
 the


United
 States
 from
 Washington
 through
 to


Richard
 Nixon.
 That
 was
 then
 constrained


by
 Congress.
 But
 what
 Schlesinger
 points


out
 that
 these
 powers,
 executive
 powers


expand
 particularly
 during
 times
 of


conflict
 and
 during
 times
 of
 war
 and
 you


might
 say
 that
 we
 live
 in
 a
 time
 of


certainly
 heightened
 conflict.
 If
 you


look
 at
 Russian
 and
 Chinese
 doctrine


towards
 the
 west,
 we
 might
 say
 we
 live


in
 a
 time
 of
 war.
 And
 so
 the
 expansion


of
 executive
 power
 fits
 with
 the
 broader


historical
 pattern
 that
 comes
 at
 the


expense
 of
 Congress
 and
 at
 the
 expense


of
 checks
 and
 balances.
 But
 I
 think
 my


broader
 point
 is
 anybody
 who
 hopes
 this


is
 just
 a
 momentary
 lapse
 of
 reason
 and


we'll
 go
 back
 to
 the
 status
 quo
 auntie,


that's
 not
 going
 to
 happen.
 So
 we
 better


get
 ready.
 No,
 we've
 always
 had
 uh
 you


know
 a
 an
 occasionally
 fraught


relationship
 with
 the
 United
 States,
 but


in
 your
 experience,
 has
 it
 ever
 been


like
 this
 before?


>> No,
 certainly
 not.
 Uh
 we
 have
 enjoyed
 a


fantastic
 relationship.
 There's
 been
 ups


and
 downs,
 but
 certainly
 from
 a
 military


perspective,
 it
 has
 been
 strong.
 Uh


certainly
 over
 the
 course
 of
 my
 40
 years


of
 of
 service.
 Uh
 I
 I
 would
 like
 to


think
 that
 that
 strength
 of
 relationship


continues
 if
 nothing
 else
 uh
 to
 maintain


a
 personal
 relationship.
 so
 that
 uh
 10,


15,
 20
 years
 from
 now
 if
 we're
 dealing


with
 a
 sensitive
 uh
 issue
 that
 our


commanders
 at
 the
 time
 can
 pick
 up
 the


phone
 and
 uh
 and
 sort
 it
 out.
 I
 think


it's
 in
 our
 best
 interest
 to
 do
 that.


>> Do
 you
 know
 whe
 because
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 Donald
 Trump
 said
 he
 needed


Greenland
 was
 because
 of
 the
 persistent


present
 threats
 by
 either
 Russia
 or


China
 in
 that
 part
 of
 the
 world.
 Do
 you


know
 if
 there
 are
 any
 credible
 threats


that
 have
 been
 picked
 up
 there?
 The
 area


between
 Greenland
 and
 the
 United
 Kingdom


centered
 with
 Iceland
 in
 the
 middle
 has


been
 an
 area
 of
 focus
 throughout
 the


Cold
 War
 because
 if
 there
 are,
 you
 know,


if
 the
 threat
 is
 coming
 from
 Russia
 and


Russia
 has
 nuclear
 submarines
 with


missiles
 that
 could
 threaten
 North


America,
 the
 area
 that
 they
 are
 most


likely
 to
 come
 down
 is
 what
 we
 used
 to


call,
 we
 still
 call
 the
 GI
 UK
 gap.


Greenland
 itself
 as
 a
 territory
 is


strategically
 located
 because
 of
 the


ability
 to
 place
 different
 types
 of


sensors
 on
 it
 that
 can
 see
 and
 we
 call


over
 the
 horizon,
 over
 the
 Arctic
 and


elsewhere.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 have


to
 remember
 is
 that
 Greenland
 and
 the


Kingdom
 of
 Denmark
 have
 been
 integrally


in,
 you
 know,
 part
 of
 the
 defense
 of


North
 America
 for
 well
 since
 the
 Second


World
 War.
 The
 Americans
 had
 troops


during
 the
 Second
 World
 War
 that
 were


were
 ensuring
 that
 Greenland
 wasn't
 used


as
 a
 as
 a
 base
 for
 weather
 stations
 or


other
 types
 of
 surveillance.
 Since
 the


end
 of
 the
 Second
 World
 War,
 since
 1951,


there
 has
 been
 a
 treaty
 between
 the


United
 States
 and
 Denmark
 that
 allows


the
 United
 States
 fairly
 unfettered


access
 to
 Greenlandish
 territory.
 It
 was


updated
 in
 2004
 to
 encompass
 the
 the


interests
 and
 frankly
 this
 the
 autonomy


of
 the
 Greenlandish
 people.
 So
 it
 is


inexplicable
 to
 me
 why
 there
 is
 this


fixation
 from
 President
 Trump
 and
 his


key
 advisers
 on
 owning
 Greenland
 when


Greenland
 has
 always
 been
 incorporated


into
 the
 defense
 of
 North
 America


completely
 seamlessly.


>> What
 do
 what
 do
 you
 think
 accounts
 for


the
 fixation
 to
 use
 Wendy's
 word
 for
 the


president
 on
 Greenland?


>> So
 the
 gap
 is
 critical
 for
 instance
 in


terms
 of
 um
 communications.
 So
 95%
 of


digital
 communications
 between
 Europe


and
 North
 America
 run
 through
 critical


infrastructure
 cables
 that
 run
 through


that
 gap.
 Russia
 and
 China
 have


repeatedly
 demonstrate
 they
 have
 the


capabilities
 and
 the
 intent
 uh
 to
 cut


communications.
 Um
 and
 this
 has
 long


been
 sort
 of
 the
 red
 line
 for
 u
 Russia


back
 to
 the
 Soviet
 Union
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


protecting
 its
 nuclear
 assets
 in
 the
 Kan


Peninsula
 and
 the
 Russian
 fleet
 in
 the


Morman
 Peninsula.
 So
 yes
 and
 so
 we
 we


have
 aggressive
 Russian
 submarine


activity
 we
 have
 some
 collusion
 with
 by


Russia
 and
 China
 but
 to
 some
 extent
 this


is
 no
 different
 than
 what
 we
 saw
 during


the
 cold
 war
 what
 we
 have
 seen
 is
 an


atrophying
 of
 capabilities
 to
 contain


that
 in
 particular
 um
 anti-ubmarine


warfare
 capabilities
 but
 some
 of
 those


were
 political
 decisions
 going
 back
 to


Pier
 Trudeau
 in
 terms
 of
 strategic
 uh


ASW
 deciding
 for
 Canada
 that
 was


actually
 destabilizing
 to
 engage
 in


strategic
 ASW.
 So
 we
 had
 already
 um


anti-
 anti-ubmarine
 warfare


capabilities.


>> But
 if
 I
 can
 say
 Christian
 that


atrophying
 of
 capability
 is
 not
 just


Canada,
 it's
 not
 just
 Denmark.
 It's
 also


the
 American
 capability.
 The
 Americans


have
 not
 invested
 in
 high
 north
 Arctic


capabilities
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 I


believe
 now
 they
 probably
 had
 wished


they
 would.
 But
 it's
 it's
 collective


decision
 on
 the
 part
 of
 all
 of
 the


allies.
 So,
 yes
 and
 no.
 Because
 I
 think


like
 we
 need
 to
 ask
 what
 is
 the
 threat


in
 the
 Arctic?
 Is
 the
 threat
 actually


different
 from
 what
 it
 was
 during
 the


Cold
 War?
 Are
 the
 Russians
 going
 to
 show


up
 with
 special
 forces
 that
 they're


going
 to
 deploy
 on
 some
 Canadian


territory
 or
 so?
 And
 I'm
 not
 sure
 the


threat
 is
 that
 much
 different
 than
 what


the
 threat
 has
 been
 pre
 previously.
 If


you
 look
 at
 the
 US
 Navy,
 for
 instance,


the
 US
 Navy
 has
 never
 really
 been


interested
 in
 the
 Arctic.
 Much
 of
 this


is
 left
 up
 to
 the
 uh
 to
 the
 US
 Coast


Guard.
 And
 so
 from
 a
 Canadian


perspective,
 we
 need
 to
 ask
 what
 is
 it


that
 we're
 looking
 to
 defend
 against?


And
 my
 sense
 is
 we
 need
 to
 distinguish


between
 threats
 in
 the
 Arctic
 and


threats
 coming
 through
 the
 Arctic.
 My


sense
 is
 threats
 in
 the
 Arctic
 are
 not


that
 different
 from
 what
 they
 were


before.
 And
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 send
 a


missile
 to
 North
 America
 and
 if
 you're


Russia,
 it's
 much
 more
 efficient
 to
 send


that
 missile
 for
 instance
 from
 the


Pacific
 off
 the
 coast
 of
 Alaska
 or
 off


the
 West
 Coast
 than
 it
 is
 uh
 than
 it
 is


from
 the
 Arctic.


>> Christian,
 don't
 give
 them
 any
 ideas,


please.
 All right.


So
 Christian,
 I
 would
 uh
 I
 would
 take


some
 exception
 to
 the
 situation
 is
 not


terribly
 different
 from
 the
 cold
 war.


You
 know
 what
 we
 have
 now
 is
 perhaps


unprecedented
 in
 history
 a
 confluence
 of


confluence
 of
 stressors
 in
 the
 security


environment.
 Geopolitics,
 climate
 change


and
 technological
 change
 acceleration.


And
 those
 three
 operating
 uh
 together


will
 create
 a
 very
 uncertain
 future.


climate
 change,
 the
 uh
 the
 Arctic
 is


becoming
 much
 more
 accessible.
 With


increased
 access
 comes
 increased


interest.
 With
 that
 increased
 interest


comes
 increased
 opportunity
 for
 tension.


Uh
 you
 have
 uh
 an
 opening
 up
 of
 uh


resource
 uh
 potential
 for
 for
 resources,


uh
 overlapping
 maritime
 claims,
 uh
 the


ability
 to
 transit
 which
 greatly
 reduces


shipping
 times
 from
 China
 to
 uh
 uh
 to


Europe.
 Uh
 we're
 seeing
 an
 unprecedented


um
 alignment
 between
 potential


adversaries.
 Here
 I'm
 talking
 Russia
 and


China.
 You
 know,
 the
 the
 Arctic


traditionally
 was
 a
 wedge
 issue
 between


the
 two
 of
 them.
 Uh
 and
 it
 goes
 back
 to


the
 1800s
 when
 uh
 when
 Russia
 seized


Chinese
 territory.
 Um
 but
 not
 so
 much


anymore.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 increasing


joint
 exercises
 in
 the
 Arctic,
 uh
 joint


bomber
 patrols,
 and
 and
 so
 when
 we
 talk


about
 the
 Arctic,
 we
 got
 to
 be
 thinking


in
 strategic
 timelines.
 When
 you
 were


chief
 of
 defense
 staff,
 did
 you
 ever


think
 to
 yourself,
 "Boy,
 we
 are
 really


vulnerable
 in
 this
 neighborhood
 in
 the


world,
 and
 I
 I
 really
 hope
 the
 United


States
 someday
 either
 invades
 or
 somehow


owns
 Greenland
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 stay


safe."


>> Absolutely
 not.
 When
 I
 was
 chief
 of


defense
 staff,
 I
 was
 the
 one
 arguing
 we


got
 to
 do
 something
 about
 this
 because


if
 we
 don't,
 uh,
 somebody
 else
 will.


>> Yeah.


>> Wendy,
 I


>> I
 would
 also
 say
 that
 I
 I
 come
 back
 to


the
 importance
 of
 the
 alliance
 and


addressing
 all
 of
 the
 issues
 that


General
 just
 mentioned.
 We
 have
 a


collection
 of
 what
 I
 mean
 what
 were
 32


like-minded
 countries
 perhaps
 you
 know


one
 of
 the
 countries
 is
 less
 like-minded


than
 it
 used
 to
 be
 the
 United
 that
 would


be
 the
 United
 States
 with
 respect
 to
 we


approach
 these
 issues
 collectively
 and


we
 decide
 how
 we're
 going
 to
 address


them
 that
 number
 one
 makes
 best
 use
 of


our
 very
 limited
 resources
 and
 I
 agree


completely
 that
 more
 resources
 are


needed
 but
 most
 importantly
 reinforces


the
 idea
 that
 we
 value
 each
 other's


sovereignty
 and
 territorial
 integrity.


And
 that's
 what
 we're
 trying
 to
 protect.


The
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 always
 like
 to


remind
 myself
 and
 others
 about
 the


Arctic
 is
 that
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 vast


white
 uninhabited
 territory
 that
 can
 be


used
 as
 some
 pawn
 on
 a
 chessboard.
 There


are
 people
 living
 there.
 The


Greenlanders
 have
 sovereign
 ability
 to


decide
 on
 their
 own
 future.
 They
 have
 so


far
 decided
 that's
 within
 the
 Kingdom
 of


Denmark.
 Our
 own
 Arctic
 peoples
 have
 um


treaty
 relationships
 with
 the
 crown.


They
 have
 rights
 in
 their
 lands
 and


their
 ideas
 and
 their
 interests
 have
 to


be
 taken
 into
 account
 and
 they
 also


appreciate
 that
 there
 is
 more
 interest


in
 their
 territories
 that
 there
 is
 more


access
 to
 their
 territories
 that
 as


global
 warming
 continues
 and
 frankly
 our


desire
 for
 all
 sorts
 of
 resources


increases
 that
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 more


outside
 interest
 but
 their
 concept
 of


what
 constitutes
 a
 security
 threat
 could


be
 very
 different
 from
 ours
 and
 that
 has


to
 be
 taken
 into
 account.
 Christian.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 agree
 with
 General
 Eron
 in


the
 sense
 and
 with
 Andy
 that
 really
 that


absolutely
 there's
 a
 change
 um
 in
 in in


scale
 and
 in
 pace
 of
 what's
 happening
 um


in
 that
 area.
 But
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 a


function
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 continuity.
 I


mean
 166,000
 kilometers
 of
 coastline,
 an


area
 that
 is
 larger
 than
 all
 of
 Europe.


But
 if
 the
 threat
 was
 really
 that
 big,


look,
 we
 have
 eight
 military
 bases
 and


on
 a
 good
 day
 we
 might
 marshall
 eight


CF-18s,
 three
 frigates
 that
 don't
 make


it
 up
 into
 the
 Arctic.
 We
 have
 Arctic


patrol
 vessels
 that
 we
 built
 that
 have


limited
 capability
 in
 the
 Arctic.
 You


know,
 would
 we
 have
 an
 entire
 brigade
 in


Latvia
 if
 the
 threat
 to
 this
 country


sort
 of
 was
 genuinely
 so
 big?
 But
 I


think
 there
 are
 certainly
 changing


threats.
 So
 hypersonic
 weapons
 for


instance
 and
 the
 missiles
 sort
 of
 that


Russia
 is
 deploying.
 uh
 these
 are


certainly
 a
 change
 in
 scale
 and
 so


having
 cold
 war
 era
 radar
 stations
 for


instance
 is
 simply
 not
 going
 to
 meet
 uh


the
 moment
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 new
 US


defense
 strategy
 it
 is
 very
 clear
 we


want
 to
 work
 with
 allies
 in
 terms
 of


protecting
 our
 interests
 and
 we
 want
 to


work
 with
 partners
 and
 allies
 in
 the


hemisphere
 to
 protect
 the
 hemisphere
 in


particular
 and
 if
 allies
 and
 partners


are
 not
 going
 to
 work
 with
 us
 then
 the


US
 will
 do
 it
 unilaterally
 that's
 why


the
 US
 keeps


>> I
 I
 heard
 the
 last
 part
 of
 that
 I
 don't


recall
 hearing
 the
 first
 part
 of
 that


which
 is
 that
 we
 want
 to
 work
 with
 our


allies
 to
 ensure
 the
 safety
 of
 the


hemisphere.


>> Um
 it's
 in
 the
 just
 released
 uh
 defense


strategy
 it
 says
 so
 explicitly
 and
 it


mentions
 Canada
 explicitly
 in
 that


context.


>> Well,
 let
 me
 pick
 up
 on
 that.
 In
 your


experience,


>> how
 intertwined
 were
 Canadian
 and


American
 military
 officials,
 soldiers,


strategies,
 etc.
 in
 order
 to
 do
 all
 the


things
 we've
 been
 talking
 about?


>> So,
 so
 firstly,
 let
 me
 go
 back
 to


Christian's
 comment.
 This
 is
 nothing


new.
 Um,
 often
 when
 I
 would
 meet
 with
 my


American
 counterparts,
 and
 this
 is
 under


the
 the
 Biden
 administration,
 the
 Arctic


was
 at
 the
 top
 of
 their
 uh
 their
 list
 of


talking
 points.
 What
 are
 you
 doing
 about


the
 Arctic?


>> Um,
 so
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do
 is
 make
 oursel


the
 indispensable
 partner
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


securing
 the
 Arctic.
 So
 again,
 somebody


doesn't
 have
 to
 do
 it
 for
 us
 and
 and
 we


lose
 sovereignty
 in
 the
 in
 the
 process.


Now,
 Steve,
 to
 your
 your
 question,
 um,


we
 are
 very
 uh
 uh
 interoperable.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 myself
 spent
 two
 years
 on


exchange
 as
 a
 deputy
 commander
 of
 a
 of
 a


airborne
 corps,
 number
 three
 in
 a


headquarters
 with
 105,000
 troops
 under


command.
 Uh,
 so
 there
 was
 a
 high
 degree


of
 trust.
 Uh,
 and
 that
 comes
 from


decades
 and
 decades
 of
 uh,
 of
 working


together.


>> Which
 administration
 was
 in
 control
 when


that
 was
 happening?


>> Uh,
 at
 that
 point
 uh,
 that
 was
 the
 Obama


administration.


>> Okay.
 So
 not
 Trump.


>> Subsequently,
 I
 was
 in
 Korea
 as
 a
 deputy


commander
 to
 an
 American
 fourstar.
 Uh,


in
 fact,
 I
 was
 in
 the
 demilitarized
 zone


when
 Trump
 visited
 with
 Kim
 Jong-un.
 So,


that's
 a
 whole
 another
 story.
 Um,
 but,


uh,
 those
 relationships
 run
 deep.


>> Yeah,


>> Wendy,


>> I
 think
 it
 I
 mean,
 like
 General,
 I


absolutely
 believe
 that
 we
 have
 to


foster
 and
 continue
 the
 professional


relationships
 we
 have
 and
 frankly


people-to-people
 relationships
 across


the
 border.
 Canada
 and
 the
 US
 are
 never


going
 to
 be
 separated
 from
 one
 another.


We
 also
 have
 to
 have
 a
 very
 cleareyed


view
 of
 the
 intent
 of
 the
 current


administration.
 And
 yes,
 they
 have
 a
 new


defense
 strategy
 that
 has
 been
 released


further
 to
 their
 national
 security


strategy.
 And
 while
 it
 mentions
 allies


and
 partners,
 it's
 very
 much
 in
 the


context
 of
 if
 we
 think
 they're
 useful,


we
 will
 use
 them.
 If
 they
 are
 working
 in


our
 interest,
 there's
 no
 sense
 of
 a


collective
 interest
 of
 what
 is
 good
 for


all,
 which
 is
 frankly
 what
 the
 whole


NATO
 alliance
 is
 based
 on.
 And
 so
 then,


you
 know
 what?
 I
 I
 do
 agree
 absolutely


with
 the
 sense
 that
 we
 have
 to
 step
 up.


We
 have
 to
 make
 these
 investments.
 We


have
 to
 do
 them
 even
 more
 quickly
 in
 our


own
 capabilities
 so
 that
 we
 defend


ourselves
 and
 I
 think
 there's
 been
 some


academic
 research
 defend
 ourselves


against
 help.
 The
 Americans
 are
 going
 to


do
 it
 one
 way
 or
 the
 other.
 We
 have
 to


prove
 that
 we
 are
 there
 first
 and


capable
 so
 that
 we
 can
 avoid
 the


ultimate
 loss
 of
 sovereignty
 that
 will


result
 if
 they
 decide
 that
 something


needs
 doing
 and
 we're
 not
 prepared
 to
 do


But
 I
 think
 Christian,
 both
 sides,
 both


countries,
 Canada
 and
 the
 United
 States,


saw
 it
 as
 in
 their
 mutual
 interest
 over


the
 years
 to
 have
 this
 relationship,


this
 interoperability


>> because
 we've
 had
 a
 decent
 level
 of


trust
 with
 each
 other.
 And
 I'm
 wondering


if
 today
 we
 can
 say
 this
 relationship


may
 look
 more
 like
 a
 liability
 than
 an


asset.
 What
 do
 you
 think?


>> Well,
 so
 let's
 think
 back
 of
 how
 this


came
 to
 be,
 right?
 Right.
 So
 it
 came


back
 to
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 Second


World
 War
 and
 a
 US
 concern
 that
 Canada


may
 not
 be
 able
 to
 defend
 itself
 if


attacked.
 And
 so
 a
 proposal
 by
 the
 US


that
 the
 Americans
 might
 need
 to
 deoil


troops
 on
 Canadian
 soil
 to
 which
 the


Canadian
 prime
 minister
 at
 the
 time


struck
 a
 quasi
 sort
 of
 strategic


agreement
 with
 the
 United
 States
 um
 that


we
 would
 work
 together
 to
 keep
 the


threats
 uh
 of
 the
 world
 uh
 as
 far
 away


from
 our
 shores
 as
 we
 can.
 This
 then


translates
 into
 what
 the
 US
 calls
 sort


of
 the
 rim
 strategy.
 So
 you
 want
 to
 keep


the
 threats
 on
 the
 Atlantic
 rim
 and
 on


the
 Pacific
 Rim
 and
 work
 with
 allies
 and


partners
 there
 and
 in
 relationship
 with


Canada
 to
 uh
 uh
 to
 be
 able
 to
 assert


that.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 that
 strategy
 has


made
 North
 America
 the
 most
 stable,
 the


most
 prosperous,
 possibly
 the
 most


desirable
 continent
 in
 the
 history
 of


the
 world.
 And
 I
 worry
 that
 we
 have


forgotten,
 especially
 as
 Canadians,
 what


got
 us
 to
 that
 special
 moment
 that


Canada
 is
 in
 today.
 because
 I
 think


we've
 forgotten
 that
 strategic
 dimension


of
 why
 we
 got
 into
 that
 relationship


with
 the
 United
 States
 in
 the
 first


place.
 Now,
 we
 might
 disagree
 with
 the


perspectives
 that
 the
 United
 States
 has


and
 that
 how
 the
 United
 States
 looks
 at


the
 world.
 But
 look,
 you
 know,
 uh
 in
 the


antiquity,
 the
 center
 of
 sort
 of
 the


world
 was,
 you
 know,
 from
 a
 western


perspective,
 the
 Mediterranean
 that
 then


shifted
 with
 sort
 of
 uh
 colonial
 modern


sort
 of
 times
 to
 the
 Atlantic
 and


clearly
 that
 center
 of
 gravity
 is


shifting
 to
 the
 Indoacific.
 So
 we
 have
 a


significant
 sort
 of
 restructuring
 of
 uh


of
 global
 dynamics
 and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 that


Canada
 and
 allies
 sort
 of
 have
 really


sort
 of
 kept
 pace
 with
 that
 over
 the


last
 25
 years
 and
 we
 love
 to
 complain


about
 what's
 coming
 out
 of
 the
 US


administration
 and
 so
 forth.
 But
 I
 would


also
 say
 we
 need
 to
 take
 some


responsibility.


>> Well
 that's
 it.
 We've
 let
 our


capabilities
 atrophy
 for
 25
 years.


>> Let's
 be
 blunt
 about
 this.
 We've
 been


seen
 as
 the
 lagards
 in
 NATO
 for
 50
 60


years.
 Right.
 That's
 fair
 to
 say.
 Well,


Canadian
 military
 history
 is
 one
 of


unpreparedness.
 You
 know,
 if
 we
 take
 a


look
 at
 1914,
 1939,
 uh
 1950,
 uh
 2001,
 uh


2022,
 yeah,
 we
 have
 not
 been
 ready.


Well,
 now
 the
 signs
 are
 clear.
 We've
 got


to
 be
 ready.
 The
 currency
 of


international
 relations
 is
 now
 hard


power.
 You
 want
 a
 seat
 at
 the
 table,
 um


you
 got
 to
 have
 something
 to
 back
 it
 up.


Um
 a
 country's
 military
 is
 it
 ultimate


insurance
 policy,
 and
 we
 have
 not
 been


paying
 the
 premiums.


>> How
 important
 to
 NATO
 has
 Canada
 been?


So
 I
 I
 take
 some
 umbrage
 at
 the
 thought


that
 we've
 been
 seen
 as
 a
 lagard.


Certainly
 not
 throughout
 the
 course
 of


NATO
 Canada.
 I
 mean
 we
 we
 have
 not


invested
 in
 domestic
 capability
 because


we
 have
 had
 significant
 capabilities
 in


Europe.
 Up
 until
 the
 early
 90s
 we
 had
 a


brigade
 land
 forces,
 we
 had
 air
 forces.


We
 have
 always
 been
 part
 of
 standing


naval
 fleet
 at
 uh
 Atlantic.
 Um
 since


then
 we
 have
 been
 in
 an
 operational


capacity
 in
 every
 operation
 that
 NATO


has
 had.
 But
 we've
 never
 hit
 2%
 of
 GDP


>> since
 2014
 when
 the
 2%
 target
 was


established.
 No,
 we
 haven't.
 And
 there
 I


mean
 I
 would
 be
 the
 first
 and
 frankly


have
 argued
 over
 the
 course
 of
 my
 career


that
 we
 need
 to
 be
 investing
 more.
 We


need
 to
 have
 done
 it
 earlier
 and
 we
 need


to
 have
 done
 it
 better.
 That
 being
 said,


the


whether
 we
 consider
 a
 2%
 an
 arbitrary


target
 and
 whether
 we
 will
 have


succeeded
 when
 we
 hit
 2%
 is
 to
 me
 a


complete
 misnomer.
 We
 need
 to
 make
 a


realistic
 assessment
 on
 what
 it
 is
 that


Canada
 needs,
 put
 a
 value
 against
 that


and
 get
 on
 with
 the
 business
 of


investing.
 If
 you
 I
 I
 would
 just
 not
 to


to
 complicate
 things
 unnecessarily,
 but


the
 2%
 figure
 and
 what
 is
 now
 actually
 a


5%
 figure
 is
 a
 costing
 of
 what
 are
 the


military
 assets
 that
 are
 required
 in


order
 to
 meet
 the
 plans
 that
 have
 been


established
 for
 the
 defense
 of
 the


Euroatlantic
 area
 under
 NATO.
 Sacker's


area
 of
 responsibility,
 Supreme
 Allied


Commander
 Europe.
 That
 doesn't
 include


North
 America.
 So,
 if
 we
 were
 being


completely
 realistic
 and
 we
 wanted
 to


pay
 play
 our
 part
 in
 the
 current
 NATO


operational
 plannings,
 our
 target
 would


have
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 because
 we
 have


other
 things
 to
 do
 other
 than
 simply


defend
 Europe.


>> Having
 said
 that,
 how
 confident
 are
 you


that
 the
 announcement
 that
 the
 current


prime
 minister
 has
 made
 that
 we're
 going


to
 go
 to
 5%
 of
 GDP
 for
 military
 spending


that
 that's
 actually
 going
 to
 happen?


Well,
 one
 one
 thing
 that
 the
 military


does
 not
 have
 the
 luxury
 of
 is
 um


determining
 what
 political
 decisions
 are


going
 to
 come
 out
 and
 whether
 those


political
 decisions
 are
 going
 to
 be


upheld
 in
 the
 years
 to
 come.
 I
 just
 want


to
 go
 back
 to
 Wendy's
 point
 on
 on


defense
 spending.
 Hey,
 the
 um
 the


percentage
 of
 GDP
 is
 not
 a
 good
 metric.


That
 is
 an
 input
 metric.
 Much
 better


defense
 planning
 is
 threat
 based.
 So
 you


take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 threats
 the
 country


is
 facing
 and
 you
 determine
 what


capabilities
 and
 readiness
 are
 necessary


to
 address
 those
 threats.
 Um
 very
 very


difficult
 to
 do.
 So
 NATO
 settles
 on
 this


input
 metric.
 It
 is
 far
 from
 perfect.
 Um


but
 it
 is
 a
 target
 nonetheless.


>> Well
 that's
 the
 thing.
 I
 mean
 it
 may
 be


far
 from
 perfect
 but
 it's
 the
 one
 that


everybody's
 agreed
 upon
 and
 the
 one


we've
 never
 hit.


>> So
 does
 that
 not
 make
 us
 look
 a
 little


weak
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 everybody
 else?


>> Yes
 it
 does.
 And
 I
 saw
 uh
 Canada's
 uh


stock
 in
 freef
 fall
 in
 the
 period
 2022


2023
 uh
 certainly
 after
 Russia's
 brutal


invasion
 of
 of
 Ukraine
 in
 in
 February
 of


22
 uh
 where
 our
 allies
 were
 uh
 were


increasing
 their
 spending
 uh
 were


increasing
 their
 investments
 and
 we
 were


um
 discussing


>> discussing
 is
 NORAD
 still
 a
 big
 deal
 for


Canada
 and
 the
 United
 States
 in
 your


view
 Christian?


I
 think
 it
 is
 a
 big
 deal
 in
 term
 of


functional
 arrangement
 but
 it's
 also


symbolically
 a
 big
 deal
 and
 it's
 a


really
 important
 question
 for
 us
 to
 ask


because
 for
 instance
 I
 think
 personally


my
 view
 if
 we
 didn't
 buy
 the
 F-35
 that


would
 be
 a
 huge
 irritant
 to
 the
 Trump


administration
 and
 it
 might
 accelerate


an
 atrophying
 of
 NORAD
 that
 we've


already
 seen
 we've
 seen
 an
 atrophying
 as


a
 result
 of
 technological
 change
 in


particular
 the
 weapon
 systems
 and
 radar


systems
 but
 we've
 also
 seen
 an
 atrophing


as
 a
 result
 of
 organizational
 and


restruct
 structuring
 and
 the
 latest
 of


that
 is
 of
 course
 the
 announcement
 of


the
 hemispheric
 or
 America's
 commands.


So
 taking
 the
 six
 combatant
 commands
 and


territorial
 commands
 and
 putting
 them


into
 an
 international
 and
 the


hemispheric
 command
 and
 we've
 seen
 the


defense
 strategy
 the
 mandates
 for
 that


command
 that
 might
 be
 more
 difficult
 to


reconcile
 with
 some
 Canadian
 priorities


in
 terms
 of
 sort
 of
 narco
 drug


trafficking
 in
 the
 Caribbean
 and
 stuff


although
 we've
 always
 uh
 had
 a
 had
 a


role
 in
 this.
 So
 one
 of
 my
 concerns
 is


that
 we
 want
 to
 hang
 on
 to
 NORAD
 both


for
 functional
 reasons
 because
 why
 do
 we


get
 into
 NORAD
 to
 begin
 with
 because
 we


would
 never
 have
 as
 a
 modest
 economy
 the


capabilities
 to
 defend
 the
 Arctic
 on
 our


own.
 And
 so
 we
 needed
 this
 functional


arrangement.
 But
 if
 it
 is
 atrophying
 for


a
 host
 of
 reasons
 then
 that
 means
 the


prospect
 of
 more
 US
 control
 of
 the


Arctic
 which
 cannot
 be
 in
 Canadian
 in


Canadian
 interests
 ultimately.
 So
 we


need
 strong
 capabilities
 in
 the
 Canadian


Joint
 Operations
 Command,
 not
 just
 for


the
 purpose
 of
 force
 projection
 and


contributions
 across
 the
 Atlantic
 and


and
 the
 Pacific,
 but
 in
 terms
 of


continental
 defense
 in
 order
 to
 work


with
 the
 Americans
 um
 ultimately
 at
 eye


level.
 And
 that
 is
 good
 not
 just
 for
 our


continental
 defense.
 It
 is
 also
 good
 for


our
 political
 and
 our
 military


arrangements
 because
 whether
 it's
 Norat


or
 NATO,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 robust


instruments
 of
 statecraftraft,
 your


voice
 is
 going
 to
 be
 significantly


diminished
 in
 both
 the
 bational


relationship
 and
 in
 the
 multilateral


relationship
 around
 the
 table
 with
 NATO.


General,
 you
 wanted
 to
 add?


>> Well,
 I'll
 just
 jump
 into
 what
 Christian


was
 saying
 there.
 Um
 the
 functional
 part


was
 really
 driven
 home
 to
 me
 when
 we


were
 shooting
 down
 balloons
 um
 in
 early


2023
 as
 they
 were
 coming
 in
 from
 the
 uh


the
 western
 Pacific
 over
 Alaska
 and
 that


integration
 or
 that
 early
 warning
 of


what
 was
 coming
 uh
 was
 uh
 was
 quite


frankly
 essential.
 What
 we
 need
 though


on
 the
 functional
 piece
 and
 this
 is
 how


what
 what
 the
 Americans
 want
 of
 us
 is


they
 see
 a
 key
 vulnerability
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 continent
 from
 the
 10:00
 to
 the


2:00
 position
 over
 Canadian
 territory.


It's
 not
 covered
 with
 sensors.
 How
 do
 we


make
 ourselves
 the
 indispensable
 partner


uh
 through
 Canadian
 uh
 sensors
 that
 go


right
 from
 space
 to
 the
 seabed
 so
 that


we
 know
 what
 is
 happening
 uh
 in
 our


territory
 and
 the
 approaches
 to
 it.


Can
 I
 ask
 you
 about
 this
 new
 national


defense
 strategy
 or
 national
 security


strategy
 that
 the
 Americans
 unveiled


towards
 the
 end
 of
 last
 year
 which


basically
 said
 I'm
 going
 to
 paraphrase


for
 simplicity
 here
 but
 basically
 said


the
 Western
 Hemisphere
 is
 ours
 and
 we'll


do
 whatever
 we
 like
 and
 you
 know
 if
 it's


if
 it's
 theirs
 the
 presumption
 is
 I


guess
 we're
 not
 part
 of
 it
 anymore.
 I


don't
 know.
 How
 much
 should
 all
 of
 that


determine
 what
 and
 how
 we
 spend
 our


money
 on
 to
 rearm
 ourselves
 for
 defense


purposes?


>> I
 think
 it's
 important,
 but
 I
 would
 also


go
 back
 to
 the
 keep
 calm
 and
 carry
 on


premise.


We
 need
 to
 do,
 I
 believe,
 Canada
 needs


to
 look
 what
 do
 we
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do


for
 our
 own
 security.
 Where
 are
 we


prepared
 to
 do
 it
 on
 our
 own
 and
 pay
 for


it?
 What
 do
 we
 need
 to
 do
 with
 our


allies?
 And
 in
 particular,
 I
 mean,


again,
 we're
 not
 we're
 not
 losing
 the


Americans.
 No matter
 how
 difficult
 or


good,
 easy
 they
 are
 to
 work
 with,
 hard


they
 are
 to
 work
 with,
 they're
 still


going
 to
 be
 there.
 So,
 we
 have
 to
 figure


out
 how
 do
 we
 bring
 our
 own
 capabilities


to
 the
 table
 so
 that
 we
 get
 a
 voice.
 And


I
 would
 come
 back
 just
 quickly
 to
 NORAD.


I
 spent
 two
 years
 as
 the
 uh
 political


adviser
 to
 Commander
 NORAD
 who
 American


commander.
 I
 was
 a
 Canadian
 diplomat


sitting
 at
 his
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 behind


occasionally
 whispering
 in
 his
 ear.


>> Was
 that
 ever
 awkward?


>> It
 was,
 I
 thought,
 a
 real
 privilege


because
 we
 have
 in
 NORAD
 a
 treaty-
 based


relationship
 that
 looks
 explicitly
 at


certain
 areas
 of
 our
 security,
 aerospace


control,
 aerospace
 warning,
 maritime


warning.
 In
 those
 areas,
 Canada
 and
 the


US
 have
 established
 processes
 and


procedures
 and
 command
 relationships


where
 we
 are
 working
 seamlessly


together.


>> So,
 how'd
 you
 feel
 a
 few
 days
 ago
 when


you
 read
 in
 the
 Globe
 and
 Mail
 that


we're
 drawing
 up
 plans
 to
 defend


ourselves
 from
 a
 US
 invasion?
 I
 think
 we


should
 have
 the
 whole
 point
 and
 I
 I


would
 look
 to
 my
 my
 wonderful
 colleague


General
 the
 whole
 point
 of
 a
 military
 is


that
 they
 are
 the
 best
 planners
 in
 the


world
 and
 I
 would
 like
 to
 think
 they


have
 plans
 for
 as
 many
 contingencies
 as


possible
 whether
 it's
 an
 invasion
 from


our
 neighbors
 to
 the
 south
 whether
 it's


you
 know
 pick
 pick
 your
 threat
 it
 has
 to


be
 uh
 threats
 you
 know
 risk
 is
 based
 on


the
 you
 know
 the
 possibility
 of
 a
 threat


happening
 and
 the
 consequence
 if
 it
 does


happening
 and
 you
 put
 your
 resources
 in


as
 as
 that
 dictates.


But
 I
 guess
 what
 I
 would
 come
 back
 to


with
 the
 states
 is
 that
 we
 have
 to
 find


a
 way
 to
 work
 with
 them
 irrespective
 of


who
 is
 in
 charge
 or
 how
 much
 we
 may
 like


or
 not
 like
 what
 they're
 saying
 and
 the


best
 way
 we
 do
 that
 is
 by
 coming
 to
 the


table
 with
 capability
 with
 sovereign


control
 over
 our
 own
 territory
 meaning


that
 we
 can
 deploy
 our
 own
 resources.


One
 of
 the
 biggest
 challenges
 I
 would


say
 just
 to
 to
 finish
 this
 thought
 in


NORAD
 is
 that
 when
 we
 went
 up
 to
 look
 at


balloons,
 we
 only
 have
 a
 certain
 amount


of
 capability
 that
 can
 track
 that


balloon
 or
 whatever
 the
 threat
 happens


to
 be
 the
 track
 of
 interest
 across


Canadian
 territory.
 And
 at
 some
 point
 we


say,
 well,
 we
 can't
 do
 it
 any
 further.


We
 need
 American
 refueling.
 We
 need
 the


American
 sensors.
 We
 need
 possibly


American
 planes
 in
 one
 instance,
 as
 I


recall,
 to
 actually
 take
 that
 threat


down.
 Well,
 then
 the
 United
 States
 says,


"Yes,
 we're
 in
 this
 relationship.
 We're


going
 to
 come
 and
 do
 it
 for
 you.
 But


hey,
 Canada
 is
 again,
 you
 really
 need


our
 refuelers.
 You
 really
 need
 our


airborne
 early
 warning
 capability,


whatever
 happens
 at
 some
 point.


>> Exactly.
 We
 need
 to
 come
 to
 the
 table


with
 stuff.


>> Christian
 and
 then
 the
 general.


>> So,
 both
 really
 important
 points
 because


the
 US
 military
 is
 very
 busy
 with
 the


capabilities
 it
 has.
 And
 I
 think
 there's


a
 message
 about
 all
 these
 things
 where


we
 help
 you
 with,
 you're
 going
 to
 need


to
 do
 on
 your
 own
 because
 we
 have
 a


bunch
 of
 other
 priorities.
 Um
 a
 slight


uh
 correction
 if
 I
 may.
 The
 national


security
 strategy
 and
 the
 national


defense
 strategy
 are
 two
 separate


documents.
 In
 national
 security
 strategy


Canada
 shows
 up
 once
 in
 national
 defense


strategy
 it
 shows
 up
 three
 times.
 That


also
 gives
 you
 a
 bit
 of
 an
 idea
 of
 there


is
 a
 role
 for
 Canada
 to
 play
 here.
 And


the
 role
 for
 Canada
 to
 play
 is
 the
 way
 I


always
 sum
 this
 up
 is
 the
 Americans
 are


best
 friends
 whether
 we
 like
 it
 or
 not.


And
 the
 Trump
 administration
 I
 think


understands
 that
 right?
 It's
 not
 like
 we


have
 a
 host
 of
 options.
 Who
 are
 you


going
 to
 ally
 with?
 Russia,
 China.
 So
 in


that
 sense,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


capabilities
 question
 is
 absolutely


critical.
 And
 I
 think
 one
 of the
 things


Canadian
 governments
 have
 never
 done


very
 well
 with
 our
 European
 allies
 is


two
 things.
 Europeans
 think
 NATO
 is


about
 defending
 Europe.
 They
 forget
 that


NATO
 actually
 has
 three
 pillars.
 Europe,


North
 America,
 and
 the
 transatlantic


space.
 We
 do
 a
 disproportionate
 amount


of
 heavy
 lifting
 in
 protecting
 that


transatlantic
 space
 in
 terms
 of
 in


particular
 tracking
 Russian
 submarines


for
 instance
 and
 in
 continental
 defense.


Why
 is
 continental
 defense
 so
 important?


Two
 reasons.
 One
 is
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 be


extorted
 in
 terms
 of
 our
 sovereign


political
 decisions
 that
 our


legitimately
 democratically
 elected


governments
 in
 Ottawa
 and
 in
 Washington


make
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 our
 interests,
 our


security
 and
 our
 defense.
 And
 if
 our


adversaries
 can
 threaten
 us
 with
 very


dangerous
 weapons
 that
 currently
 in


Canada
 we
 would
 have
 very
 little


capacity
 to
 defend
 against
 um
 then
 that


effect
 effectively
 sets
 us
 up
 to


political
 extortion
 by
 those


adversaries.
 Also
 remember
 those
 weapons


in
 the
 1950s
 this
 was
 a
 flyover
 problem


in
 terms
 of
 the
 Arctic
 in
 Canada
 and


they
 were
 going
 to
 hit
 the
 United


States.
 Today
 if
 you
 hit
 Canada
 it
 would


have
 just
 as
 disruptive
 an
 impact
 on


North
 America
 as
 it
 would
 if
 you
 hit
 the


uh
 if
 you
 hit
 the
 United
 States.
 The


other
 is
 of
 course
 if
 we
 believe
 as


Canadians
 that
 we
 don't
 want
 nuclear


proliferation
 in
 the
 world
 and
 I
 cannot


think
 of
 any
 reason
 why
 we
 would
 then
 we


need
 to
 protect
 extended
 strategic


nuclear
 deterrence
 from
 the
 United


States
 to
 our
 partners
 and
 allies


because
 if
 they
 believe
 that
 that


extended
 nuclear
 deterrence
 is
 no
 longer


credible
 then
 you
 will
 have
 partners
 and


allies
 in
 both
 the
 Indoacific
 and
 in


Europe
 acquiring
 their
 own
 nuclear


weapons
 and
 that
 cannot
 possibly
 be


stable.
 izing
 for
 the
 world
 and
 we
 need


to
 explain
 that
 an
 investment
 in


continental
 defense
 and
 in
 national


defense
 for
 Canada
 is
 an
 investment
 in


NATO
 and
 to
 Wendy's
 point
 I
 think
 we've


not
 communicated
 that
 well
 and
 it's
 not


well
 understood
 general


>> so
 there's
 a
 whole
 bunch
 there
 to
 unpack


I
 want
 to
 add
 a
 few
 points
 um
 hey
 let's


face
 it
 US
 is
 not
 going
 away
 China's
 not


going
 away
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to


coexist
 but
 how
 do
 we
 coexist
 from
 a


position
 of
 strength
 or
 being
 strong


enough
 but
 also
 from
 a
 position
 of


confidence
 in
 in
 ourselves.
 I've
 seen
 a


lot
 of
 hot
 spots
 around
 the
 world.
 Uh
 a


lot
 of
 countries
 in
 trouble.
 Um
 a
 lot
 of


failed
 and
 failing
 states.
 We've
 got
 it


good
 here
 in
 Canada.
 Uh
 we've
 got
 a


country
 that's
 got
 a
 tremendous
 amount


going
 for
 it.
 We
 just
 need
 to
 and
 we


have
 a
 proclivity
 of
 gazing
 at
 our


neighbors
 and
 and
 beating
 ourselves
 up.


Uh
 but
 no,
 we
 need
 to
 find
 that
 self


that
 sense
 of
 confidence
 and
 and
 and
 see


ourselves
 through
 this
 challenge.
 These


documents,
 national
 security
 strategy


and
 national
 defense
 strategy.
 National


Defense
 Strategy
 came
 out
 yesterday.


Every
 administration
 puts
 them
 out.
 It's


a
 cycle.
 It's
 good.
 It's
 in
 their
 law.


We
 can
 learn
 something
 from
 that.
 My


concern,
 and
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 my
 initial


comment
 about
 a
 period
 of
 disorder
 and


and
 and
 miscalculation
 as
 potential


adversaries
 look
 at
 these
 documents
 and


see
 the
 focus
 on
 the
 Western
 Hemisphere,


could
 that
 miscalculation
 be
 giving
 them


license
 to
 do
 something
 in
 their
 own
 in


their
 own
 so-called
 sphere
 of
 influence?


>> What
 do
 you
 think?


>> Taiwan.
 uh
 Eastern
 Europe,
 Russian


hybrid
 warfare,
 um
 you
 know,
 seizing


some
 of
 the
 former
 uh
 uh
 uh
 Soviet


territories.
 Um
 don't
 know.
 Uh
 one
 of


the
 challenges
 is
 we
 have
 adversaries
 uh


authoritarians
 who've
 surrounded


themselves
 with
 uh
 yesmen
 uh
 who
 share


that
 same
 worldview.
 and
 any
 competing


perspective.
 Well,
 um
 if
 you're
 lucky


enough
 not
 to
 fall
 out
 of
 a
 window,
 um


>> not
 to
 put
 too
 fine
 a
 point
 on
 it,
 but


>> you're
 dismissed.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so


the
 analysis
 that
 they
 might
 be
 getting


could
 be
 rather
 shallow
 and
 if
 they
 see


these
 documents,
 could
 it
 cause
 a


miscalculation?
 That's
 my
 fear.
 So
 if
 I


would
 just
 very
 quickly
 come
 in
 and
 say


which
 to
 me
 is
 the
 the
 heartbreak
 over


the
 last
 few
 weeks
 worth
 of
 churn
 with


respect
 to
 President
 Trump's
 threats


against
 Greenland
 because
 there
 are
 real


threats.
 We
 have
 an
 active
 conflict
 in


Ukraine
 perpetrated
 by
 Russia.
 We
 have


deaths
 happening
 every
 day
 of
 civilians


of
 military
 members.
 We
 haven't
 been


talking
 about
 Ukraine
 for
 the
 last


couple
 of
 weeks.
 We've
 been
 talking


about
 some
 supposed
 threat
 from
 the


United
 States
 toward
 Greenland.
 We


haven't
 been
 looking
 at
 some
 of
 the
 most


pressing
 international
 problems
 that


pose
 real
 and
 tangible
 threats
 to
 Canada


and
 to
 the
 Western
 Alliance.
 Instead,


we've
 been
 naval
 gazing
 collectively.


>> Let
 me
 just
 add
 a
 historical
 analogy


here.
 No,
 no
 historical
 analogy
 is


perfect,
 but
 this
 one
 I
 think
 we
 can


learn
 something
 from
 it.
 uh
 Korea
 1950


uh
 North
 Korea
 supported
 by
 Russia
 and


or
 Soviet
 Union
 at
 the
 time
 and


communist
 China
 uh
 did
 not
 believe
 that


South
 Korea
 was
 in
 the
 uh
 United
 States


sphere
 of
 interest.
 Well,
 it
 turned
 out


it
 was
 and
 look
 what
 happened
 and
 the


same
 thing
 could
 happen
 today.
 Hm.
 All


right,
 let
 me
 just
 rerack
 here
 for
 a


second
 because
 for
 those
 who
 join
 us


late,
 we
 want
 to
 remind
 everybody
 here


that
 we
 are
 in
 hangar
 A
 of
 the


Bombardier
 Center
 for
 Aerospace
 and


Aviation
 at
 Centennial
 Colleg's


dedicated
 aerospace
 campus.
 It's
 part
 of


DARE
 Downs
 View
 Aerospace
 Innovation
 and


Research.
 And
 let
 me
 reintroduce
 our


guests.
 They
 are
 retired
 General
 Wayne


Ay
 who
 was
 Canada's
 chief
 of
 defense


staff
 from
 2021
 to
 24.
 Wendy
 Gilmore
 is


here,
 former
 assistant
 secretary
 general


for
 defense
 investment
 at
 NATO,
 among


many
 major
 external
 affairs
 postings.


And
 Christian
 Lipre
 is
 here,


distinguished
 professor
 at
 the
 Royal


Military
 College
 of
 Canada
 and
 Queens


University.
 Here's
 here's
 a
 weird
 way
 to


get
 into
 this
 next
 subject.
 Uh
 we
 we
 are


sitting
 here
 taping
 this
 in
 the
 last


weekend
 of
 January,
 which
 means
 last


night
 at
 the
 Scotia
 Bank
 Arena,
 Mitch


Mner
 made
 his
 return
 for
 the


to
 a
 Toronto
 audience.
 And
 strangely


enough,
 I
 was
 at
 the
 game
 and
 some
 guy


started
 to
 talk
 to
 me.
 What
 did
 he
 talk


to
 me
 about?
 Mitch
 Mner's
 return?
 No.
 He


wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 me
 about
 whether
 we


should
 buy
 the
 F-35s
 or
 the
 Swedish


Griffin
 plane?


and
 seemed
 like
 an
 odd
 place
 to
 have


that
 conversation,
 but
 my
 hunch
 is
 if


somebody's
 raising
 it
 at
 a
 hockey
 game,


then
 it
 has
 reached
 the
 level
 of


interest
 where
 Canadians
 across
 the


country
 are
 fascinated
 by
 this


conundrum
 we
 now
 face.
 And
 so,
 well,


let's
 take
 a
 moment
 here.
 We
 could
 talk


about
 this
 for
 hours,
 but
 we're
 not


going
 to.
 Let's
 take
 a
 moment
 here
 and


talk
 about
 whether
 we
 should
 be
 buying


as
 many
 as
 88
 CF35s


or
 F-35s,
 excuse
 me,
 from
 the
 Americans


or
 whether
 the
 Swedish
 option
 is
 a


better
 way
 to
 go.
 Okay,
 Christian,
 start


us
 off.


So,
 Canadian
 governments
 have
 a
 long


history
 of
 using
 defense
 investments


really
 as
 an
 economic
 strategy.
 And


we're
 not
 the
 only
 country
 in
 the
 world.


And
 I
 think
 the
 trade-off
 is
 always
 is


it
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lowercase
 D
 and
 a


capital
 I
 or
 is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 a
 capital


D
 and
 a
 lowercase
 I?
 And
 inherently,
 um,


politicians,
 whether
 it's
 cabinet,


caucus
 or
 parliament,
 are
 going
 to
 be


looking
 at
 what
 is
 this
 going
 to
 be


doing
 for
 me
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


investing
 all
 this
 money.
 But
 we
 have
 a


curious
 I
 think
 affected
 work
 here.


Usually
 budgeting
 works
 by
 you
 go
 to
 the


department,
 you
 do
 a
 threat
 analysis,


you
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 the


department
 needs.
 Here
 we
 decided
 we're


going
 to
 get
 to
 an
 arbitrary
 spending


point.
 Um,
 and
 I'm
 still
 not
 quite
 sure


how
 we
 came
 up
 with
 the
 figure
 that
 uh


the
 prime
 minister's
 office
 is
 throwing


out
 there
 because
 my
 math
 works


differently
 than
 theirs,
 but


irrespective
 of
 that.
 And
 so
 now
 we're


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 we're
 actually


going
 to
 be
 spend
 be
 spending
 it
 on.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 sort
 of
 the
 important


point
 of
 your
 of
 of
 the
 show,
 right?
 So


asking
 the
 conversation,
 asking
 to
 what


end?
 Is
 it
 to
 protect
 the
 continent?
 Is


it
 for
 force
 projection?
 Is
 it
 for


contribution
 warfare
 so
 we
 can
 curry


favor
 with
 the
 United
 States
 and
 uh
 um


and
 uh
 and
 with
 other
 allies?
 Or
 is
 it


first
 and
 foremost
 to
 uh
 drive
 the


Canadian
 economy
 at
 a
 time
 sort
 of
 when


we
 have
 challenges
 in
 terms
 of
 our


possibly
 declining
 standard
 of
 living


and
 uh
 and
 the
 like?
 And
 those
 are


challenging
 political
 trade-offs.
 And
 I


think
 we
 always
 need
 to
 remember,
 and
 I


think
 this
 is
 also
 what
 I
 take
 away
 from


General
 and
 from
 Wendy,
 that
 um
 and


generals
 usually
 don't
 like
 it
 when
 I


say
 this,
 the
 the
 the
 Canadian
 armed


forces
 are
 first
 and
 foremost
 not
 a


defense
 organization.
 They
 are
 a


political
 instrument.
 The
 same
 with


NATO.
 The
 the
 the
 North
 American
 and


Atlantic
 Council
 is
 the
 chief
 civilian


authority
 over
 NATO.
 that
 it
 is


ultimately
 at
 the
 disposal
 of


politicians
 to
 achieve
 political
 ends


that
 they
 believe
 to
 be
 in
 the
 best


interest
 of
 the
 country.


>> These
 do
 want
 in
 defense
 I'm
 going
 to


>> defense
 is
 one
 instrument


>> in
 a
 broad
 toolkit
 that
 increasingly
 we


need
 to
 use
 multiple
 instruments


together
 to
 achieve
 that
 effect.


>> Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to
 answer
 the
 question.


We
 are
 already
 buying
 the
 F-35.
 We
 are


under
 contract
 for
 an
 initial
 and
 I


almost
 forget
 16
 that
 we
 are
 coming
 in


and
 we
 are
 then
 have
 an
 option
 for


additional
 aircraft.


>> One
 of
 the
 things
 and
 and
 Christian


spoke
 about
 some
 of
 the
 challenges
 for


defense
 procurement.


>> We
 need
 to
 stop
 beating
 ourselves
 up


about
 decisions
 we've
 already
 taken
 and


we
 need
 capability
 now.
 The
 F-18
 CF-18s


are
 coming
 to
 the
 end
 of
 their
 natural


life.
 We
 need
 an
 air
 capability
 to


protect
 our
 own
 interests.
 Now,
 there


are
 issues
 with
 the
 F-35
 that
 I
 can


identify,
 not
 the
 least
 of
 which
 is
 the


political
 challenges
 of
 the
 states.
 But


on
 an
 ongoing
 basis,
 are
 we
 able
 to
 get


the
 necessary
 software
 upgrades,
 you


know,
 ongoing
 engagement
 on
 that


aircraft
 if
 the
 Americans
 don't
 want
 us


to
 have
 it?
 That's
 an
 issue.
 No matter


what
 technology
 we
 access,


>> you
 want
 88
 of
 them,
 though.
 That's
 not


a
 question
 that
 I'm
 prepared
 to
 answer


as
 a
 you
 know
 call
 it a
 diplomat


political
 expert.
 Our
 air
 force
 should


be
 able
 to
 say
 these
 are
 the
 tasks.
 This


is
 how
 many
 aircraft
 government
 we
 need


to
 fulfill
 those
 tasks.
 If
 you
 don't


want
 to
 give
 us
 that
 many
 aircraft,
 this


is
 the
 smaller
 box
 of
 tasks
 that
 we
 can


perform.


>> But
 the
 air
 force
 cannot
 make
 the


political
 I
 don't
 think
 can
 not
 make
 the


political
 judgment
 of
 how
 do
 we
 respond


to
 the
 US
 screwing
 us
 over
 right
 now.
 So


there
 is
 first
 of
 all
 the
 F
 CF
 30
 it


will
 be
 a
 CF35
 right
 is
 I
 think
 anyway


our
 designation
 of
 the
 F-35
 is
 a
 global


aircraft
 there
 is
 a
 global
 fleet
 it
 is


going
 to
 be
 in
 use
 in
 many
 of
 our
 NATO


allies
 it's
 in
 use
 in
 Japan
 in
 Australia


and
 elsewhere
 around
 the
 world
 that


global
 fleet
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 there


to
 be
 sustained
 and
 it
 is
 you
 know


emotionally
 I'd
 perhaps
 say
 to
 hell
 with


the
 Americans
 right
 now
 because
 I
 don't


like
 your
 president,
 but
 we
 need


capability
 and
 these
 aircraft
 are


currently
 under
 production
 and
 we're


going
 to
 get
 them
 soon.
 Had
 we
 stuck


with
 the
 original
 contract,
 we'd
 already


be
 flying
 the
 F-35
 right
 now.
 That


doesn't
 mean
 to
 say
 is
 that
 we


shouldn't.
 Now,
 there
 are
 additional


resources
 and
 the
 government
 needs
 to


understand
 what
 those
 resources
 need
 to


be
 that
 we
 need
 to
 look
 at
 sovereign


capabilities
 and
 answering
 to
 our
 own


interests.
 But
 right
 now,
 let's
 just
 get


the
 bloody
 aircraft.
 Enough.


>> Couple
 of
 points.
 Um
 hey
 let
 me
 address


Christian's
 point
 about
 generals
 and


politics.
 Um
 you
 know
 war
 is
 an


extension
 of
 politics
 as
 as
 Klausvitz


famously
 said
 but
 it
 is
 a
 fundamental
 of


military
 professionalism
 in
 a
 democracy


that
 the
 military
 is
 subservient
 to
 duly


elected
 civilian
 uh
 officials
 and
 we


follow
 orders
 and
 and
 drive
 on
 whatever


the
 decision
 is.
 And
 I
 saw
 many
 times
 as


chief
 of
 defense
 staff
 where
 my
 advice


was
 not
 taken
 or
 it
 was
 taken
 in


consideration
 of
 other
 factors
 well


beyond
 the
 military
 sphere.
 And
 and
 so


we
 have
 to
 realize
 that.
 Secondly,
 um
 on


the
 F-35
 in
 particular,
 hey,
 we
 we
 we


know
 the
 F-35
 is
 the
 the
 most
 capable
 of


of
 the
 of
 the
 options


>> and
 most
 expensive.


>> Yes.
 And
 we
 saw
 that
 um
 we
 saw
 the
 F-35s


in
 use
 over
 Iran
 uh
 from
 the
 Israelis


penetrating
 their
 air
 defense
 and
 and


and
 going
 ahead
 there.
 Um
 and
 so
 what


decision
 is
 is
 going
 to
 be
 in
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 a
 political
 decision,
 not
 a


military
 decision.
 And
 we
 and
 the


military
 will
 have
 to
 live
 with
 whatever


decision
 is
 made.
 But
 all
 that
 being


said,
 I
 think
 we
 can
 use
 this
 as
 an


opportunity
 to
 springboard
 to
 the
 next


generation
 of
 fighters.
 We
 need
 to
 be


thinking
 about
 the
 rapidly
 changing


character
 of
 war.
 How
 wars
 are
 being


fought
 which
 is
 underpinned
 by
 that


rapid
 technological
 change
 I'm
 talking


I've
 talked
 about
 before
 this
 uh
 this


next
 fighter
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 adopt


something
 called
 the
 collaborative


combat
 aircraft.
 So
 a
 loyal
 wingman
 that


is
 an
 unmanned
 aircraft
 that
 is
 tethered


to
 a
 a
 crude
 aircraft
 and
 use
 that
 as
 a


springboard
 to
 the
 next
 generation
 of


completely
 uh
 uncrrewed
 autonomous
 uh


fighters.
 easy
 for
 a
 guy
 from
 an
 army


background
 to
 say,
 especially
 with
 a


whole
 bunch
 of
 uh
 aircraft
 behind
 me


that
 had
 pilots.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think
 that's


where
 we
 need
 to
 go
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time


um
 really
 uh
 engage
 Canadian
 aerospace


industry
 on
 this.


>> But
 let
 me
 ask
 the
 followup.
 Sweden
 is


offering
 that
 if
 we
 build
 their
 if
 we


buy
 their
 plane,
 they'll
 build
 it
 here.


>> Should
 that
 matter
 in
 our


decision-making?
 Well,
 from
 a
 political


level,
 you
 have
 to
 decide
 is
 capability


more
 important
 than
 jobs.
 Um,
 and
 if
 we


take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 Grippin,
 um,
 a
 great


aircraft
 for
 right
 now,
 um,
 is
 probably


half
 it
 is
 half
 a
 generation
 behind
 of


of
 most
 modern,
 but
 we're
 going to
 have


this
 aircraft
 for
 20,
 30,
 40
 years.
 Uh,


where's
 it
 going
 to
 be
 then?


>> Wendy,
 what's
 your
 view?


>> So,
 in
 a
 procurement
 timeline,
 and
 I


spent
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time
 in
 a


procurement
 world,
 so
 I
 can't
 speak
 for


them,
 but
 I
 can
 speak
 about
 them.
 We


have
 a
 now
 problem.
 We
 have
 a
 fiveyear


out
 problem.
 And
 then
 we
 have
 a
 longer


term,
 call
 that
 the
 development,
 the


technological
 drift
 problem.
 The
 now


problem
 is
 the
 lifespan
 of
 our
 current


CF-18s
 and
 our
 need
 to
 provide


capability
 right
 now.
 We
 are
 in
 and


maybe
 I'll
 not
 skew
 the
 conversation
 too


much,
 but
 we're
 in
 a
 conflict
 with


Russia
 right
 now.
 We
 as
 Canada
 are


facing
 hybrid
 attacks.
 Our
 allies
 in


Europe
 are
 facing
 daily
 hybrid
 attacks.


The
 Russians
 are
 testing
 the
 defenses
 of


NATO.
 We
 need
 to
 have
 capability
 to


bring
 to
 the
 flight
 to
 the
 fight
 in
 a


very
 short
 order
 if
 that
 were
 required.


We're
 buying
 aircraft
 possibly
 for
 the


next
 2530
 years
 unless
 we
 are
 in
 a


situation
 in
 which
 there
 is
 significant


attrition
 in
 which
 case
 those
 aircraft


could
 be
 gone
 tomorrow
 and
 we
 would
 need


something
 to
 follow
 them.
 So,
 we
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 walk
 and
 chew
 gum
 at
 the
 same


time,
 which
 is
 we
 need
 a
 fleet
 now.
 We


need
 a
 fleet
 a
 few
 years
 from
 now,
 which


is
 what
 we'll
 get
 out
 of
 the
 ones
 that


we're
 already
 under
 contract
 to
 receive.


Then
 we
 need
 to
 think
 about
 how
 are
 we


positioning
 ourselves
 with
 allies


because
 the
 one
 thing
 that
 Canada
 has


learned
 back
 with
 the
 Afro
 Arero
 story


is
 that
 we
 do
 not
 have
 the
 resources


ourselves
 to
 develop
 a
 completely
 unique


capability.
 So,
 we
 have
 to
 choose
 the


partners
 we're
 going
 to
 work
 with,
 but


we
 also
 need
 manufacturing
 and
 advanced


manufacturing
 capabilities
 in
 Canada.


And
 that's
 frankly
 one
 of
 the
 things
 the


F-35
 has
 done
 for
 us
 to
 date.
 And
 I
 I


mean,
 I
 have
 ultimately
 if
 we
 were
 under


contract
 to
 take
 the
 Griffin,
 I'd
 say


let's
 carry
 on
 with
 the
 Grippin.
 I
 just


believe
 in
 getting
 on
 with
 doing
 what


we've
 said
 we
 were
 going
 to
 do.
 But
 we


went,
 one
 of
 my
 favorite
 things
 to
 quote


is
 in
 1939,
 we
 had
 no
 ship
 building


industry
 to
 speak
 of
 whatsoever.
 By


1945,
 we
 were
 the
 fourth
 largest
 ship


builder
 in
 the
 world.
 This
 facility
 that


we're
 sitting
 on
 right
 now
 was
 producing


thousands
 of
 aircraft
 that
 was
 developed


over
 the
 course
 of
 a
 short
 couple
 of


years.
 What
 I
 believe
 we
 need
 right
 now


is
 the
 Canadian
 public
 to
 provide
 the


political
 will
 necessary
 to
 our


government
 to
 get
 on
 with
 the
 bu


business
 of
 reconstituting
 our
 forces,


rebuilding
 Canadian
 capability
 and
 at


the
 same
 time
 making
 sure
 we
 have
 the


manufacturing
 ability
 to
 continue
 to


sustain
 it.


>> Last
 quick
 word
 on
 this.


>> So
 qualitatively
 the
 Grippen
 and
 the


F-35
 are
 completely
 different
 entities.


Um
 the
 F-35
 is
 a
 digital
 platform
 that


among
 other
 things
 happens
 to
 fly.
 So
 um


we
 also
 in
 terms
 of
 procurement
 there's


three
 things
 you
 want
 to
 accomplish


right
 you
 want
 to
 get
 it
 on
 a
 timeline


there's
 the
 cost
 and
 there's
 the


capabilities
 and
 those
 are
 difficult


trade-offs
 and
 I
 would
 say
 on
 most


procurement
 projects
 you
 have
 to


compromise
 on
 one
 of
 those
 it
 seems
 in


Canada
 we
 can
 never
 do
 any
 three
 of


those
 and
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 our
 colleagues


in
 Washington
 and
 among
 allies
 it
 drives


them
 completely
 insane
 every
 time
 we


walk
 back
 a
 commitment
 and
 the


reputational
 cost
 in
 particular
 to


Canada
 of
 constantly
 making
 performative


announcements
 and
 then
 walking
 them
 back


is
 ultimately
 incalculable
 in
 terms
 of


the
 consequences
 that
 we
 suffer
 from


that.
 And
 I
 I'll
 close
 on
 this.
 One
 of


my
 US
 colleagues
 like
 to
 say
 ultimately


when
 it
 comes
 to
 defense,
 it's
 up
 to
 the


people
 to
 decide
 and
 the
 people
 are


allowed
 to
 be
 wrong.
 The
 problem
 is
 I


would
 say
 in
 terms
 of
 civil
 military


relations
 in
 this
 country
 and
 with
 all


respect
 to
 the
 very
 challenging


circumstances
 that
 our
 chiefs
 of
 defense


staff
 find
 themselves
 in,
 we
 live
 in
 an


era
 where
 we
 need
 to
 have
 a
 much
 more


robust
 conversation
 between
 the
 defense


and
 security
 establishment
 and
 the


political
 authority.
 And
 in
 my
 view,
 we


have
 been
 too
 subservient
 because
 it
 is


also
 up
 to
 the
 to
 to
 the
 organizations


to
 explain
 to
 Canadians
 the
 rapidly


changing
 threat
 environment
 uh
 kinetic


um
 nuclear
 hybrid
 that
 we
 are
 living
 in


and
 the
 very
 homeopathic
 posture
 that
 we


have.
 And
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 program


here
 is
 precisely
 to
 do
 that
 because
 if


we're
 going
 to
 spend
 billions
 on
 defense


and
 possibly
 asking
 Canadians
 to
 make


significant
 sacrifices
 in
 order
 to
 do


that,
 we
 need
 to
 get
 social
 license
 for


those
 expenditures.
 And
 I'm
 not
 sure


that
 the
 organizations
 and
 the


institutions
 or
 our
 political
 leadership


has
 done
 enough
 of
 the
 heavy
 lifting.


But
 I
 think
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 that


out
 of
 some
 of
 the
 discourse


politically.
 I
 want
 to
 give
 this


audience
 the
 heads
 up
 that
 I'm
 going
 to


do
 one
 more
 round
 up
 here
 and
 then
 we'll


put
 a
 microphone
 in
 the
 middle
 right


there
 and
 uh
 we'll
 get
 you
 to
 take
 uh


we'll
 take
 your
 questions
 at
 that
 point.


So,
 let's
 do
 one
 last
 thing
 here
 and


that
 is
 okay.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 what's
 on


your
 wish
 list.
 General,
 we're


apparently
 going
 to
 be
 spending
 tens
 of


billions
 of
 dollars
 over
 the
 next
 x


number
 of
 years
 rearming
 and


reinvigorating
 our
 military.
 What
 do
 you


want
 to
 spend
 that
 money
 on?


>> How
 much
 time
 do
 we
 have?


>> Okay.
 Hey,
 so
 firstly
 our
 strategic


culture
 is
 changing
 and
 we
 need
 to
 be


focused
 much
 more
 at
 home.
 Our
 strategic


culture
 up
 to
 now
 has
 been
 expeditionary


in
 nature
 and
 we've
 preferred
 away
 games


to
 home
 home
 games.
 While
 the
 home
 game


now
 is
 absolutely
 number
 one
 priority
 so


we
 need
 to
 know
 what's
 happening.
 So
 all


what
 we
 call
 all
 domain
 awareness
 uh


from
 space
 to
 the
 seabed
 especially
 in


the
 Arctic.
 So
 sensor
 technology


infrastructure
 in
 the
 north
 so
 that
 we


can
 project
 capabilities
 from
 the
 south.


I'm
 not
 talking
 about
 permanent
 basing


in
 the
 north
 but
 persistent
 presence
 by


projecting
 capabilities
 uh
 from
 the


south
 to
 the
 north.
 We
 need
 to
 maintain


um
 some
 expeditionary
 capability
 so
 that


we
 can
 help
 influence
 the
 emerging
 order


so
 that
 we
 have
 a
 seat
 at
 the
 table
 or


at least
 can
 whisper
 in
 the
 ear
 to


somebody
 who's
 got
 a
 seat
 at
 the
 table.


>> How
 many
 people
 would
 that
 require?


>> Um


you
 know
 I'm
 not
 prepared
 to
 to
 put
 a


number
 out
 right
 now.
 Uh
 but
 certainly


more
 than
 what
 we've
 got
 now.
 100,000


120,000
 regulars
 perhaps.
 Uh
 but
 don't


but
 don't
 quote
 me
 on
 that.
 I
 guess
 it's


too
 late
 to
 say
 that.
 Um
 but
 there's
 a


number
 of
 capabilities
 with
 the
 evolving


again
 the
 evolving
 character
 of
 war
 that


goes
 with
 it.
 Far
 more
 autonomous


systems.
 You
 know
 we've
 uh
 we've
 got
 a


habit
 of
 investing
 in
 these
 really


expensive
 high-end
 exquisite
 systems
 uh


that
 if
 you
 lose
 your
 uh
 um
 loss
 in
 the


first
 weeks
 of
 combat
 you're
 uh
 it's


going
 to
 be
 bad
 for
 you.
 We
 need
 to


invest
 much
 more
 in
 mass-produced


attractable
 systems.


>> Attitudable
 meaning


>> meaning
 they
 can
 you
 can
 lose
 them


without
 problem.
 Think
 drones
 in
 uh
 in


Ukraine.


>> Um
 you
 know
 $50,000
 drone
 uh
 that
 if
 you


lose
 uh


>> so
 be
 it.
 But
 if
 you
 take
 out
 a
 $2


million
 tank,
 well
 excellent,
 good
 on


you
 because
 there's
 an
 economics
 of


defense
 that's
 happening
 here.
 So,
 we
 do


need
 some
 of
 those
 high-end
 exquisite


systems,
 but
 we
 also
 got
 to
 invest
 in


those
 rapidly
 changing
 mass-roduced


systems.


>> Gotcha.
 Okay.
 Wendy,
 what's
 on
 your


list?


>> So,
 I
 spent
 much
 of my
 life
 as
 a


bureaucrat.
 What's
 on
 my
 list
 is
 a


system
 and
 process
 that
 is
 empowered
 to


make
 rapid
 decisions
 that
 can
 uh
 evolve


as
 it's
 need
 to.
 We
 we
 talk
 to
 NATO
 a


lot
 about
 the
 time.
 It's
 the
 speed
 of


relevance.
 So
 we
 need
 a
 system
 that
 can


move
 at
 the
 speed
 of
 relevance
 which
 is


bloody
 fast.
 Um
 we
 have
 been
 promised
 a


defense
 investment
 agency
 by
 the


government
 that
 is
 to
 be
 a
 single


decision
 maker.
 There's
 still
 a
 lot
 of


challenges
 with
 standing
 up
 that


apparatus.
 It's
 not
 all
 about
 process.
 I


mean
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 process
 you


have.
 If
 you
 have
 the
 political
 will
 to


take
 decisions
 and
 move
 things
 out,
 it


will
 happen
 quickly.
 So
 my
 wish
 list
 is


clear
 unambiguous
 decision-making


ability
 to
 make
 decisions
 and
 to
 make


them
 in
 such
 a
 way
 that
 we
 can
 evolve
 to


to
 meet
 the
 speed
 of
 what
 is
 necessary.


>> Can
 you
 give
 us
 a
 for
 instance
 on
 that?


What
 does
 that
 look
 like?


>> Well,
 a
 for
 instance,
 we've
 already
 seen


a
 little
 bit
 of
 it
 which
 is
 I
 would
 say


slightly
 encouraging
 which
 is
 the


government
 has
 said
 all
 right
 we
 need
 a


submarine
 capability
 to
 not
 just
 replace


the
 one
 I
 have
 but
 to
 build
 that


capability.
 So
 in
 very
 rapid
 order
 they


went
 instead
 of
 going
 through
 a
 long


process
 that
 is
 prioritized
 to
 to


protect
 against
 procurement
 risk
 they've


said
 we
 have
 two
 we've
 down
 selected
 to


two
 different
 suppliers
 one
 in
 Korea
 one


in
 Germany
 there's
 a
 very
 expedited


prices
 process
 going
 on
 right
 now
 to
 say


all
 right
 give
 us
 your
 bested
 best
 bids


that
 you
 can
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 a


decision
 and
 what
 I
 would
 like
 to
 see


the
 the
 practical
 outcome
 is
 we're
 gonna


make
 a
 decision
 and
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


good
 for
 the
 people
 that
 lose
 but


whatever
 we've
 made
 a
 decision
 and
 we're


going
 to
 go
 ahead
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 get


that
 submarine
 into,
 you
 know,


operations
 into
 a
 capability
 as
 soon
 as


as
 possible.


>> And
 one
 last
 followup,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,


>> yeah,


>> does
 the
 Minister
 of
 Defense
 make
 that


call?
 Does
 the
 Prime
 Minister
 make
 the


call?
 Who
 makes
 the
 call?


>> So,
 the
 legal
 authority
 to
 buy
 or


otherwise
 acquire
 capability
 for
 the


Canadian
 Forces
 is
 the
 Minister
 of


Public
 Services
 and
 Procurement
 Canada.


>> Oh,
 neither
 one.
 So
 ultimately
 though


these
 types
 of
 decisions
 tend
 to
 be
 a


cabinet
 decision
 but
 what
 cabinet
 needs


to
 do
 is
 say
 here
 are
 our
 criteria
 let


the
 process
 assess
 the
 bids
 whichever


one
 meets
 that
 criteria
 then
 let's
 move


on
 with
 it
 as
 opposed
 to
 what
 we've
 seen


many
 many
 times
 including
 with
 the
 F-35


right
 now
 is
 that
 we
 go
 back
 and
 we


revisit
 the
 criteria
 over
 and
 over


again.
 Yes,
 circumstances
 change,
 things


happen,
 but
 at
 some
 point
 in
 order
 to


get
 real
 pieces
 of
 equipment
 like
 we


have
 behind
 us,
 you
 actually
 need
 to


make
 a
 decision
 and
 just
 do
 it.


>> Gotcha.
 Christian,
 what's
 on
 your
 list?


>> Three
 quick
 things.
 The
 first
 is
 we
 came


out
 of
 World
 War
 II
 with
 the
 fourth


largest
 military
 in
 the
 world
 if
 you


don't
 count
 the
 VM
 having
 been


resoundingly
 defeated.
 And
 we
 said
 to


ourselves,
 what
 we
 experienced
 during


the
 first
 half
 of
 the
 20th
 century,
 this


is
 not
 the
 world
 that
 we
 want
 to
 live


in.
 And
 we
 invested
 aggressively
 in


instruments
 of
 statecraftraft
 and
 in


multilateral
 institutions
 to
 shape
 the


environment
 of
 the
 second
 half
 of
 the


20th
 century.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 we
 have


forgotten
 the
 opportunity.
 We
 are


reacting.
 We
 don't
 have
 the
 initiative.


How
 do
 we
 get
 back
 the
 initiative?


Where's
 the
 Canadian
 politician
 that


actually
 has
 a
 vision
 and
 a
 strategy
 of


the
 country
 and
 the
 world
 that
 we
 want


to
 live
 in
 5,
 10,
 and
 25
 years
 from
 now


and
 the
 investments
 that
 we
 are
 going
 to


make
 to
 that
 end?
 Can
 I
 just
 ask
 you
 to


answer
 that
 question?
 Do
 you
 see
 that


politician
 out
 there
 right
 now?
 Well,


for
 better
 or
 for
 worse,
 as
 much
 as
 we


want
 to
 impugn
 some
 of
 our
 US


colleagues,
 and
 I
 always
 like
 to
 say,


look,
 none
 of
 us,
 at least
 I'm
 not
 a


dual
 citizen,
 so
 I
 don't
 get
 a
 vote.
 You


know,
 moralizing
 what
 happens
 in
 the


United
 States
 is
 not
 helpful.
 But
 at


least
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 for
 better


or
 for
 worse,
 there's
 a
 very
 active


political
 conversation
 about
 the
 future


of
 the
 United
 States
 and
 what
 country
 uh


America
 wants
 to
 be
 and
 what
 role
 it


should
 play
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 clearly


the
 Trump
 administration
 right
 or


wrongly
 has
 decided
 we
 are
 going
 to
 play


a
 very
 different
 role
 in
 this
 very


different
 world
 uh
 from
 sort
 of
 breaking


with
 with
 past
 continuity.
 The
 second


the
 two
 other
 key
 points.


How
 many
 shows
 like
 yours
 have
 I
 done


where
 people
 say
 we
 should
 be
 working


for
 peace?
 We
 shouldn't
 be
 putting
 money


into
 defense.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 this
 is


exactly
 what
 gets
 us
 in
 trouble.
 Because


implicit
 in
 that
 statement
 is
 the


Americans
 will
 do
 it
 for
 us
 if
 we
 get
 in


trouble.
 And
 if
 we
 take
 that
 approach,


then
 we're
 exactly
 back
 to
 when
 you
 took


us
 at
 the
 beginning,
 my
 late
 colleague


Neils
 Orvik.
 Defense
 from
 help.
 What
 are


we
 investing
 in?
 In
 capabilities
 to


defending
 ourselves
 from
 circumstances


where
 the
 US
 administration
 says,
 "Let


us
 help
 you."
 Because
 when
 the
 US
 comes


in
 and
 says,
 "Let
 us
 help
 you."
 When
 it


comes
 to
 our
 national
 security,
 whether


it
 comes
 to
 financial
 crime,
 to
 cartels,


to
 human
 trafficking,
 to
 defense
 and


whatnot,
 we
 are
 compromising
 our
 own


political
 and
 economic
 sovereignty
 as
 a


result.
 And
 rightly
 or
 wrongly,
 the


frustration
 in
 Washington
 with
 Canada


goes
 well
 back
 well
 beyond
 uh
 the


current
 Trump
 administration.
 And
 so


this
 is
 an
 investment
 in
 defense
 from


help.
 This
 is
 an
 investment
 in
 our


political
 economic
 sovereignty.
 And
 to


play
 it
 full
 circle
 coming
 back
 to
 1775,


British
 troops
 had
 our
 whoever
 our
 was


at
 the
 time
 our
 back.
 Today
 there's
 no


one
 that
 has
 our
 back.
 It
 is
 entirely
 up


to
 us
 as
 Canadians
 what
 sovereignty
 we


ultimately
 want
 to
 have
 and
 protect
 and


what
 role
 we
 want
 this
 country
 to
 play.


>> You
 want
 to
 pick
 apart
 any
 of
 that?


>> Nope.


>> Okay.


>> Want
 to
 hear
 from
 them?


>> Okay,
 friends.
 We
 have
 a
 microphone
 in


the
 aisle.
 We
 would
 encourage
 you
 to


line
 up
 behind
 the
 microphone.
 If
 you


wouldn't
 mind,
 just
 give
 us
 your
 first


name
 and
 where
 you're
 coming
 from
 and


then
 uh
 fire
 away.
 Yes,
 sir.
 Thank
 you


for
 starting
 us
 off.


>> Uh
 Zach
 Toronto.
 Uh
 my
 question
 to
 the


uh
 to
 the
 panel
 is
 how
 much
 of
 the


holding
 of
 the
 procurement
 for
 F-35
 is


in
 relation
 to
 the
 trade
 deal
 and
 using


that
 as
 a
 carrot
 and
 how
 often
 are


military
 procurements
 used
 for
 trade


negotiations.
 Thank
 you.


>> So
 formally
 they
 are
 of
 course


completely
 disconnected.
 Um
 you
 asked


about
 in
 the
 past
 the
 one
 of
 the
 recent


examples
 was
 uh
 when
 um
 Boeing
 was


pursuing
 what
 we
 felt
 to
 be
 very
 unfair


trade
 practices
 against
 Canada,
 the


United
 States
 against
 Canada.
 Um
 there


was
 a
 a
 policy
 enacted
 by
 the
 Canadian


government
 that
 said
 uh
 where
 companies


are
 not
 acting
 in
 Canada's
 interest,


they
 should
 not
 be
 part
 of
 public


procurement.
 Um
 that
 said,
 there
 is
 of


course
 a
 calculus
 going
 on
 inside
 the


government
 of
 Canada
 trying
 to


understand
 how
 do
 they
 get
 to
 a
 point
 in


engaging
 with
 the
 United
 States
 that
 we


can
 protect
 what
 we
 need
 which
 is
 access


to
 the
 American
 market
 because
 there's
 a


broader
 economic
 sovereignty
 frankly
 our


own
 economic
 stability
 is
 based
 at
 the


moment
 still
 because
 of
 access
 to
 the
 US


market.
 So
 it's
 uh
 it's
 a
 difficult


decision
 that
 our
 government
 has
 but


there's
 no
 direct
 line
 from
 one
 to
 the


other.
 They'll
 be
 looking
 at
 a
 whole


suite
 of
 different
 capabilities
 and


different
 decisions
 as
 part
 of
 that


process.


>> Christian
 Zach,
 here's
 my
 frustration


with
 Canada
 on
 this.
 Right.
 So,
 going


back
 to
 the
 Avo
 Arrow
 F-35
 invested


hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 you
 and
 my
 tax


dollars.
 Um,
 the
 uh
 submarine
 decision,


the
 German
 Norwegian
 Consortium
 is


writing
 its
 software
 in
 a
 company


headquartered
 in
 Canada.
 We're
 about
 to


do
 it
 with
 Canadian
 Nuclear
 Laboratories


in
 in
 the
 way
 that
 contract
 is


structured.
 We
 generate
 uh
 Canadian


intellectual
 property,
 worldleading


intellectual
 property
 here
 in
 Canada
 and


then
 we
 effectively
 give
 it
 away
 and
 we


either
 decide
 we're
 not
 going
 to
 procure


the
 technology,
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 walk


away
 from
 it
 or
 we
 structure
 our
 IP


contracts
 in
 ways
 that
 doesn't
 protect


it
 or
 we
 have
 research
 security
 that


effectively
 lets
 our
 adversaries
 in


China
 and
 Iran
 take
 that
 intellectual


property.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 the
 investments


that
 we
 have
 already
 made
 in
 the


technology
 why
 would
 we
 walk
 away
 from


it
 given
 that
 we've
 already
 this
 is
 our


return
 on
 investment
 this
 is
 how
 we


remain
 a
 high-tech
 innovation
 country


because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 intellectual


property
 and
 you
 look
 at
 how
 much
 of
 it


is
 generated
 in
 the
 United
 States


relative
 to
 Canada
 our
 partners
 in
 the


Indoacific
 and
 our
 allies
 in
 Europe
 the


leading
 IP
 uh
 development
 remains
 in
 the


United
 States
 and
 so
 it's
 up
 to
 us
 that


if
 we're
 already
 investing
 in
 it,
 we


might
 as
 well
 keep
 it
 here
 and


capitalize
 on
 it.


>> Christian,
 have
 you
 been
 talking
 to
 Jim


Balsley
 lately?


>> He's
 been
 beating
 this
 drum
 for
 a
 long


time.
 You
 want
 a
 word
 on
 this
 or
 you


good?


>> No,
 I'm
 good.


>> You're
 good.
 Okay.
 Next,
 please.


>> Hi,
 Nicholas
 from
 Toronto
 as
 well.


>> Hi,
 Nicholas.


>> Um,
 my
 question
 is
 regarding
 um
 recently


India
 and
 Russia
 uh
 signed
 an
 Arctic


trade
 or
 Arctic
 uh
 defense
 agreement
 uh


giving
 them
 access
 to
 Arctic
 naval
 ports


and
 logistics.


Um,
 how
 must
 Canada
 think
 about


nonarctic
 state
 actors
 getting
 invested


interest
 in
 the
 Arctic?
 Now,


>> who
 wants
 in
 on
 that?


>> You
 want
 to
 start?


>> I
 can
 start,
 but
 but
 yeah,
 you
 go
 ahead


and
 I'll
 jump
 in.


>> Um,
 so,
 uh,
 Canadian
 policy
 to
 date
 has


been
 that
 the
 Arctic
 nations
 should
 have


the
 first
 voice
 in
 the
 management.


Frankly,
 Arctic
 peoples
 have
 the
 first


voice
 and
 Arctic
 nations
 have
 the
 voice


in
 the
 management
 of
 this
 territory.
 Um


I
 can't
 speak
 to
 the
 India
 Russia
 u


agreement.
 I'm
 not
 familiar
 with
 it.
 But


uh
 but
 our
 position
 would
 continue
 to
 be


that
 the
 the
 primary
 interest
 in
 the


Arctic
 has
 to
 be
 the
 people
 that
 live


there
 and
 it's
 our
 responsibility
 to


protect
 their
 interests.


>> General.


>> Yeah.
 So
 much
 like
 China
 uh
 they
 have
 an


interest
 for
 resource
 extraction
 and
 and


shipping
 routes.
 Um
 as
 and
 again


thinking
 in
 strategic
 timelines.
 So


decades
 ahead
 as
 uh
 as
 much
 as
 climate


change
 has
 an
 effect
 up
 there.
 um
 what's


going
 to
 happen?
 Well,
 you're
 going
 to


see
 fish
 protein
 migrate
 north.
 And
 so,


much
 like
 the
 uh
 the
 devastating
 uh


fishing
 fleets
 that
 China
 has
 across
 the


world,
 well,
 those
 will
 move
 north
 as


well.


>> And
 uh
 and
 India
 is
 looking
 at
 that
 as


well.
 And
 so,
 yeah,
 we
 need
 to
 be


concerned
 about
 what
 happens
 in
 uh
 in


our
 backyard
 in
 the
 uh
 in
 the
 Arctic.
 It


may
 not
 be
 within
 the
 uh
 Canada's
 EEZ
 uh


but
 certainly
 close
 enough.


>> EEZ
 um
 exclusive


>> exclusive
 economic
 zone.
 Sorry
 for
 the


acronyms.
 Um,
 China
 has
 been
 doing
 a


tremendous
 amount
 of
 uh
 research
 in
 the


Arctic.


>> Uh,
 a
 couple
 of
 ships,
 the
 Jou
 Long
 2


have
 been
 up
 there
 every
 summer.
 Uh,
 in


fact,
 they
 probably
 have
 a
 better


picture
 of
 the
 seabed
 uh
 than
 than
 the


Americans
 do
 in
 many
 places.


>> So,
 what's
 that
 for?
 Resource


extraction,
 submarines.


>> Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of it's
 dual
 use.
 Christian.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 this
 president
 we
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 assert
 our
 sovereignty
 in
 the


Arctic
 against
 clearly
 people
 who
 have
 a


very
 active
 and
 in
 some
 cases
 quite


aggressive
 uh
 interests
 in
 the
 Arctic.


But
 I
 also
 think
 we
 need
 to
 keep
 that
 in


context.
 So
 everybody
 loves
 to
 talk


about
 the
 Northwest
 Passage.
 If
 you've


been
 up
 there
 and
 you've
 seen
 the


Northwest
 Passage,
 you
 know
 it
 is
 too


shallow
 and
 it
 is
 too
 narrow
 for
 the


large
 container
 ships
 that
 we
 have


today.
 What
 happens
 when
 you
 get
 out
 of


the
 Northwest
 Passage?
 Well,
 you're
 in


Greenland.
 you
 are
 hundreds
 of
 miles


away
 from
 the
 next
 serious
 port


infrastructure.
 And
 the
 third
 is
 you


can't
 actually
 pay
 the
 insurance
 rates


to
 go
 through
 the
 north
 because
 it
 is
 um


imagine
 if
 you
 have
 sort
 of
 an
 accident


up
 there
 and
 you
 ultimately
 have
 to


clean
 that
 up.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 also
 need


to
 keep
 in
 context
 yes
 adversaries
 have


a
 keen
 interest
 but
 how
 that
 will


actually
 manifest
 in
 an
 area
 that
 is


really
 hard
 to
 access
 and
 relatively


would
 require
 huge
 investments
 I
 think


by
 the
 Canadian
 government
 in
 ter
 of


critical
 infrastructure
 to
 make
 it


profitable
 for
 for
 people
 to
 invest


something
 very
 different
 of
 course
 your


predecessor
 I
 think
 has
 a
 famous
 quote


about
 like
 you
 know
 if
 if
 one
 of
 these


adversaries
 deployed
 to
 the
 Arctic


what's
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 he
 would
 do


he
 would
 send
 out
 a
 search
 party


>> yeah
 well
 search
 and
 rescue
 which
 is


Another
 important
 point.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 because
 a
 manifestation
 of
 national


sovereignty
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 uh
 to
 do


search
 and
 rescue
 uh
 within
 your
 own


territory.
 And
 if
 you
 don't
 do
 it,
 uh


somebody
 else
 will.


>> I
 was
 in
 Taiwan
 for
 uh
 for
 a
 week
 in


September.
 And
 I
 saw
 manufactured
 uh


crises
 of
 of
 ships
 in
 trouble
 uh
 that


China
 was
 exploiting
 to
 gradually
 erode


Taiwanese
 sovereignty.
 ship
 in
 trouble


dispatch
 Chinese
 search
 and
 rescue
 into


Taiwanese
 waters.
 Um
 there's
 a
 model


perhaps
 for
 our
 our
 north
 in
 the
 years


to
 come.


>> We've
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 line
 here.
 So
 I


want
 to
 encourage
 uh
 nice
 snappy


questions
 and
 nice
 snappy
 answers
 too
 if


I
 can.
 Go
 ahead
 please.


>> Hi
 uh
 George
 from
 Vaughn.
 Uh
 I
 just
 also


want
 toh
 say
 thank
 you
 Steve
 for
 being


here
 and
 to
 the
 panel.
 Thank
 you
 for


coming
 out
 during
 this
 uh
 cold
 snap
 that


we've
 been
 having.
 So
 appreciate
 it.
 Uh


just
 very
 quickly,
 can
 you
 speak
 to
 the


industrial
 strategy
 that
 Canada
 has
 and


the
 dual
 use
 policy
 that
 we've
 been


trying
 to
 implement
 and
 how
 on
 board
 our


allies
 are
 on
 this
 topic
 and
 can
 you


just
 mention
 the
 roadblocks
 that
 this


policy
 might
 have?
 Thank
 you.


>> So
 I
 think
 the
 first
 roadblock
 is


getting
 the
 policy
 out.
 Um
 we
 heard


before
 Christmas
 that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be


out
 by
 Christmas.
 Didn't
 say
 what
 year.


Uh
 but
 I
 think
 when
 the
 when
 the


strategy
 comes
 out
 we
 we
 should
 be
 happy


and
 um
 but
 until
 then
 we
 can't
 really


talk
 about
 it.


>> I
 I
 would
 just
 say
 it
 is
 a
 defense


industrial
 strategy.
 Its
 first
 purpose


should
 be
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 have
 the


industrial
 base
 necessary
 to
 support
 the


Canadian
 armed
 forces.
 Its
 second


purpose
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 are


protecting
 the
 indigenous
 intellectual


property,
 the
 other
 technology
 that
 is


Canadian
 that
 we
 need.
 and
 his
 third


priority
 is
 to
 help
 the
 Canadian
 economy


and
 make
 sure
 we
 have
 economic
 benefit.


I
 just
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 those


those
 priorities
 are
 not
 reversed.


>> This
 guy's
 got
 the
 right
 shirt
 for


today.
 Okay,
 here
 we
 go.


>> Start.
 Yes.
 Uh
 we
 do
 live
 great
 country.


That's
 why
 I
 wore
 that.
 I
 think
 it's


helpful
 to
 remember.
 I
 think
 that
 was


mentioned
 on
 the
 panel.
 And
 the
 Arctic.


Um
 I
 lived
 up
 in
 Nunvid.
 I
 saw
 people


there.
 And
 uh
 just
 wondering
 if
 you


could
 talk
 more
 about
 uh
 the
 rangers


their
 involvement
 and
 how
 is
 how
 is
 more


um
 being
 developed
 with
 uh
 with
 the


Inuit
 people
 and
 their
 involvement
 as


they
 have
 been
 with
 with
 Arctic


sovereignty


>> general.


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 the
 rangers
 for
 everybody


who
 is
 not
 familiar
 with
 them
 they
 are
 a


great
 organization.
 Um
 about
 5,000


across
 the
 country
 uh
 just
 over
 a


thousand
 up
 in
 the
 Arctic
 area.
 They


live
 in
 the
 communities.
 They
 are


part-time
 reservists.
 Uh
 they
 are
 the


eyes,
 ears,
 and
 guides
 for
 the
 Canadian


military
 across
 the
 extremities
 of
 our


country.
 They
 help
 a
 lot
 with
 uh
 with


RCMP
 and
 ground
 search
 and
 rescue,
 and


their
 role
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to


evolve
 as
 we
 focus
 more
 and
 more
 on
 on


Arctic
 security.
 Uh
 but
 as
 we've
 seen


over
 the
 course
 of the
 last
 number
 of


decades,
 they
 provide
 tremendous
 service


to
 Canada.


>> Christian,
 good
 followup.


>> There's
 about
 as
 many
 people
 who
 live
 in


the
 north
 as
 live
 in
 my
 hometown
 of


Kingston.
 um
 and
 they
 are
 extremely


vulnerable
 communities.
 But
 if
 you
 talk


to
 them,
 what
 is
 their
 priority?
 When


you
 talk
 to
 them
 about
 security
 and


defense,
 it's
 human
 security
 issues,


it's
 food
 security,
 it's
 energy


security.
 And
 that
 gets
 back
 to
 the


previous
 question
 that
 what
 we
 need
 to


invest
 in
 is
 dual
 use.
 So
 in
 the
 north,


it
 is
 multi-use
 ultimately
 investments


in
 critical
 infrastructure
 and
 in


technology
 that
 need
 to
 benefit
 our


local
 quasi
 sovereign
 partners.


>> Very
 good.
 Thanks
 for
 the
 question.


Next,
 please.
 Hi,
 I'm
 Aiden.
 Uh,
 my


question
 is,
 what
 should
 Canada's


military
 priorities
 be
 in
 the
 next


decade?
 Territorial
 defense,


international
 peacekeeping
 or
 alliance


commitments,
 uh,
 for
 example,
 NATO
 and


why?


>> You
 want
 to
 know
 what
 the
 top
 priority


should
 be
 of
 that
 list?


>> Okay.
 Well,
 top
 priority
 is
 the
 home


game.
 Uh,
 so
 protecting
 Canada
 at
 home


and
 specifically
 more
 and
 more
 the


Arctic.
 Uh,
 peacekeeping.
 Hey,
 I
 saw
 the


death
 of
 peacekeeping
 in
 the
 former


Yugoslavia
 in
 uh
 in
 93
 at
 the
 battle
 of


Madak
 Pocket
 where
 the
 thin
 veneer
 of


civilization
 was
 ripped
 away
 and
 uh
 our


our
 myth
 of
 interpositional
 peacekeeping


that
 was
 developed
 in
 the
 in
 the
 60s


that
 is
 gone.
 Um
 and
 that
 type
 of


peacekeeping
 is
 not
 coming
 back.


Supporting
 our
 allies
 where
 we
 can
 uh


overseas,
 yeah,
 absolutely.
 But
 we've


got
 to
 be
 very
 disciplined
 as
 to
 where


we
 put
 our
 forces.
 Our
 last
 defense


policy,
 our
 our
 north
 strong
 and
 free


gave
 us
 a
 number
 of
 tiers.
 Uh,
 you
 know,


top
 tier
 uh
 defending
 the
 country
 and


specific
 focus
 on
 the
 Arctic
 and
 then


the
 transatlantic
 relationship
 and


Indo-Pacific.
 We
 can
 only
 spread
 the
 uh


uh
 spread
 our
 butter
 on
 the
 toast
 so


thin
 uh
 to
 quote
 Bilbo
 Bagots.


>> We
 can
 only
 do
 so
 much.


>> Yeah.


>> Gotcha.
 Yes,
 sir.


>> Um
 Richard
 from
 Burlington,
 thank
 you


all
 for
 coming
 today.
 I
 was
 hoping
 you'd


be
 able
 to
 expand
 on
 a
 couple
 of
 things


that
 have
 confused
 me
 from
 your


responses.
 Uh
 talk
 of
 need
 for
 Canada
 to


invest
 in
 being
 able
 to
 monitor
 our


north.
 Is
 that
 not
 part
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 uh


Saab
 Grippin
 uh
 proposal?
 Not
 only
 are


they
 saying
 buy
 planes
 from
 us,
 but
 also


the
 Golden
 Eye
 plane
 built
 on
 a
 Canadian


airframe
 allowing
 us
 to
 patrol
 and


maintain
 control
 over
 our
 own
 north.
 Uh


we
 are
 investing
 with
 Australia
 in
 a
 sea


to
 uh
 space
 radar
 system
 to
 be
 built
 in


the
 north.
 I
 believe
 we
 annoyed
 some


Americans
 by
 not
 buying
 their
 system.
 Do


not
 these
 uh
 deals
 with
 nations
 other


than
 America
 expand
 our
 abilities,
 show


our
 commitment
 to
 our
 neighbors
 and
 also


give
 us
 industry
 here
 in
 Canada
 to
 your


point
 of
 an
 attritable
 resource.
 uh


F-35,
 wonderful
 plane,
 but
 very
 very


expensive.
 Whereas
 the
 Grippin
 is
 less


expensive,
 has
 greater
 room
 for
 growth.


>> How
 do
 you
 know
 so
 much
 about
 this?


That's
 what
 I


>> I
 read
 one
 or
 two
 things.
 And
 if
 you


lose
 it,
 we
 can
 rebuild
 it
 right
 here
 in


Canada
 cuz
 the
 plant
 is
 here
 versus
 if


we
 lose
 an
 F-35,
 we're
 at
 the
 end
 of
 a


waiting
 list.


>> So,
 if
 you
 had
 some
 uh
 insight
 into


that,
 I'd
 appreciate
 it.
 Thank
 you.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 we
 we
 just
 got
 to
 be
 careful


about
 silver
 bullet
 systems.
 And
 we're


talking
 about
 sensors.
 What
 we
 need
 are


layered
 sensors.
 Uh
 so
 the
 Australian


system
 you
 talked
 about
 was
 the
 Arctic


over
 the
 horizon
 radar.
 So
 it's,
 you


know,
 think
 a
 groundbased
 radar.
 Uh
 the


uh
 the
 aircraft
 you're
 talking
 about


fills
 what's
 known
 as
 an
 airborne
 uh
 uh


airborne
 early
 warning
 system.
 So
 think


of
 a
 a
 a
 plane
 mounted
 radar
 system.
 We


also
 need
 spacebased
 systems.
 So
 we
 have


those
 layers
 of
 sensors
 uh
 so
 that
 we've


got
 some
 redundancy.
 Um,
 you
 know,


again,
 going
 back
 to
 2023
 and
 shooting


down
 balloons,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


was
 driven
 home
 to
 me
 was
 the
 lack
 of


groundbased
 radar
 coverage
 that
 our


country
 has.
 And
 the
 reason
 we
 took
 down


a
 balloon
 in
 Yukon
 was
 I
 was
 afraid


we're
 going
 to
 lose
 it
 as
 it
 came
 closer


or
 as
 it
 moved
 into
 the
 Canadian


interior
 because
 we
 don't
 have
 that


coverage.
 So,
 it's
 that
 layer
 system


that's
 important.
 If
 I
 I
 would
 just
 uh


add
 in
 the
 one
 point
 you
 absolutely
 made


which
 I
 I
 think
 is
 very
 important
 is


that
 we
 have
 to
 have
 relationships
 with


a
 lot
 of
 different
 allies.
 We
 do
 not


want
 all
 of
 our
 capabilities
 in
 one


bucket.
 And
 if
 we've
 learned
 anything


over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 last
 months
 or
 so


in
 the
 changing
 uh
 rhetoric
 coming
 out


of
 the
 American
 administration
 is
 that


we
 have
 been
 overly
 dependent
 on
 the
 US


for
 our
 source
 of
 technology,
 our


economic
 prosperity
 and
 others.
 So
 the


partnership
 with
 Australia,
 very


important
 partnership
 with
 European


allies,
 we
 now
 have
 the
 foundation
 to


get
 even
 more
 down
 into
 that
 space
 with


the
 signing
 of
 a
 defense
 cooperation


arrangement
 with
 the
 European
 Union
 as


the
 Europeans
 develop
 more
 sovereign


capabilities.
 Working
 with
 Canada
 is


also
 going
 to
 be
 in
 their
 interest.
 I


think
 focusing
 too
 much
 on
 individual


pieces
 of
 equipment
 is
 is
 exactly
 we
 we


tend
 to
 go
 down
 a
 rabbit
 hole.
 F-35


versus
 the
 Grippin.
 Well,
 we
 have
 an


F-35
 contract
 right
 now.
 We
 will
 need


something
 that
 will
 follow
 it.
 Whether


that
 continues
 to
 be
 the
 same
 piece
 of


equipment
 or
 a
 different
 one
 or


different
 capabilities,
 that's
 what
 we


have
 to
 try
 and
 focus
 on.


>> Christian,
 and
 we
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 the


kit,
 but
 what
 we
 really
 need
 to
 talk


about
 is
 the
 people
 because
 regardless


of
 buying
 a
 plane,
 we're
 going
 to
 need


pilots
 for
 that
 plane.
 We're
 going
 to


need
 technicians.
 We're
 going
 to
 need


submariners.
 We're
 going
 to
 need
 Mars


officers.
 And
 we
 already
 have
 trouble


generating
 the
 crews
 that
 we
 need
 today.


So
 what
 my
 worry
 is
 we're
 going
 to
 buy


this
 wonderful
 equipment
 and
 then
 we're


not
 going
 to
 have
 the
 people
 to
 operate.


If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 it
 was
 a
 great


question
 because
 the
 question
 indicates


the
 breadth
 of
 what
 we're
 asking
 the


Canadian
 armed
 forces
 to
 do
 today


relative
 to
 what
 we
 asked
 them
 to
 do
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 cold
 war.
 We're
 asking


them
 to
 do
 ever
 more
 things
 in
 terms
 of


quantity,
 quality,
 and
 complexity.
 And


relative
 to
 that,
 even
 with
 the


additional
 investment,
 we
 continue
 to


see
 sort
 of
 relative
 declining
 resources


for
 this
 growing
 number
 of
 tasks.
 So


it's
 the
 it's
 first
 and
 foremost
 about


for
 me
 it's
 about
 the
 people
 not
 the


kit.


>> I
 think
 it's
 also
 important.
 I
 think
 one


of the
 great
 things
 is
 I
 just
 saw


something
 released
 in
 the
 last
 few
 days


that
 uh
 there
 have
 been
 more
 applicants


for
 the
 Canadian
 forces
 in
 the
 last
 12


months
 than
 than
 uh
 anticipated.


Significant
 numbers
 of
 people.
 And
 I


look
 at
 all
 of
 the
 young
 people
 in
 the


room
 and
 I
 would
 say
 there
 is
 a
 great


career
 for
 you
 in
 the
 forces
 supporting


the
 forces
 in
 industry.


Go
 study
 STEM.


>> Couldn't
 say
 it
 better
 myself.


>> I
 was gonna
 say
 you're
 not
 gonna
 have
 no


argument
 from
 this
 guy
 here.
 We
 have


time
 for
 two
 more
 questions.
 So
 yes,


please.


>> Yeah.
 Thank
 you.
 My
 name
 is
 Sorup
 and
 I


have
 an
 AI
 consulting
 firm
 in
 Toronto


and
 we
 mostly
 operate
 in
 fintech
 and


e-commerce
 space.


>> Okay.


>> So
 someone
 coming
 from
 totally


nontraditional
 background
 like
 outside


from
 aerospace
 defense,
 is
 there
 any


meaningful
 way
 I
 can
 make
 contribution


to
 to
 this
 sector
 in
 future?
 Is
 there
 a


meaningful
 way
 he
 can
 make
 a


contribution
 to
 this
 sector?


>> And
 and
 so
 you
 said
 you're
 involved
 with


AI.


>> AI.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> Fintech.
 Fintech.
 Yes.


>> Fintech
 and
 and
 fintech.
 So,
 you
 know,


much
 in
 the
 wider
 national
 security


sphere,
 uh
 fintech
 is
 becoming


increasingly
 important
 as
 we
 see
 um


security
 threats
 to
 Canada
 manifest.
 Uh


they
 they
 they
 there's
 a
 security
 nexus


to
 so
 many
 things.
 Uh
 finance
 is
 right


at
 the
 top.
 So
 getting
 involved
 in


financial
 security
 for
 the
 country


essential


>> Christian.


>> So
 we
 talk
 about
 national
 security
 but
 I


think
 the
 challenge
 is
 then
 that
 makes


it
 sound
 like
 the
 federal
 government
 or


defense
 can
 somehow
 solve
 these
 problems


on
 their
 own
 and
 given
 the
 complexity
 of


the
 challenges
 given
 the
 types
 of
 threat


vectors
 that
 we
 have
 it
 requires
 a
 whole


of
 government
 and
 a
 whole
 of
 society


approach
 where
 defense
 sort
 of
 plays


just
 one
 role.
 And
 you've
 seen
 the
 prime


minister
 announce
 a
 significant
 increase


in
 the
 primary
 reserves,
 a
 significant


increase
 in
 the
 supplementary
 reserves,


but
 also
 I
 think
 there's
 what
 we
 haven't


done
 particularly
 well
 is
 provide


exactly
 the
 sort
 of
 motivated


individuals
 that
 want
 to
 do
 something


for
 their
 country
 to
 be
 able
 to
 pitch
 in


and
 to
 find
 those
 mechanisms.


>> So
 who
 does
 he
 call?


>> I
 would
 say
 there
 is
 a
 um
 we
 have
 been


promised
 another
 beyond
 the
 defense


industrial
 strategy.
 The
 government
 has


announced
 that
 it
 will
 be
 launching
 a


platform
 for
 a
 new
 type
 of
 supplementary


reserve
 to
 allow
 Canadians
 to
 sign
 up


and
 to
 let
 their
 capabilities
 be
 known.


I'm
 really
 anxious
 to
 see
 what
 that


looks
 like.
 And
 uh
 I'd
 also,
 you
 know,


the
 recruiting
 center
 is
 right


>> going
 to
 Christian's
 point,
 you
 know,


what
 we
 need
 national
 resilience
 right


down
 to
 the
 provincial,
 territorial,
 and


municipal
 levels.
 uh
 a
 sense
 of


self-reliance,
 the
 ability
 to
 rely
 on


yourself
 and
 and
 not
 just
 wait
 for
 help


from
 the
 federal
 government
 uh
 with
 that


learned
 helplessness
 uh
 because
 the


security
 threats
 are
 manifesting,
 not


just
 man-made
 threats,
 but
 natural


disasters
 as
 well.
 The
 increasing


frequency
 and
 intensity
 of
 natural


disasters
 is
 something
 that
 we
 really


need
 to
 worry
 about.
 Um
 and
 so
 municipal


governments
 have
 a
 role
 in
 this
 as
 well


and
 including
 in
 uh
 in
 fintech
 and
 AI.


>> Interesting.
 No
 pressure,
 but
 you've
 got


the
 last
 question.


>> Thanks,
 Steve.
 Uh,
 hi,
 I'm
 Danilo
 from


Toronto
 and,
 uh,
 you'll
 have
 to
 forgive


me
 for
 how
 broad
 this
 may
 be,
 but
 I


wanted
 to
 talk
 about,
 uh,
 the
 motif,
 the


narrative,
 the
 notion,
 whatever
 you
 want


to
 categorize
 it
 as
 Canada,
 its
 identity


as
 a
 peacekeeping
 nation.
 And
 as
 we
 all


know,
 geopolitics
 and
 world
 events
 are


very
 fluctuating.
 And
 we
 this
 has
 been


talked
 about
 throughout
 the
 whole
 um


conversation,
 but
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 know


long
 term
 um
 should
 we
 still
 stick
 by


that
 moniker?
 Should
 that
 be
 something


that
 other
 world
 leaders
 and
 countries


should
 see
 as
 the
 first
 thing
 they
 they


identify
 with
 Canada
 and
 and
 should
 we


stick
 by
 it
 or
 should
 there
 be
 some
 new


ideas
 to
 the
 table
 so
 to
 speak?
 So,
 I


think
 that
 was
 a
 certain
 period
 in
 our


history.
 And
 hey,
 I
 wore
 a
 blue
 beret
 on


two
 two
 missions
 overseas.
 Uh,
 but
 that


was
 a
 short
 period
 in
 our
 rather
 longer


military
 history.
 Hey,
 World
 War
 I,
 uh,


we
 put
 600,000
 in
 uniform,
 60,000
 killed


in
 action.
 Uh,
 World
 War
 II,
 we
 put
 1.1


million
 in
 uniform,
 far
 more
 than
 on
 any


peacekeeping
 mission.
 You
 know,
 Korean


War,
 the
 same
 thing.
 The
 war
 in


Afghanistan,
 the
 same
 thing.
 and
 and
 so


focusing
 on
 the
 ability
 to
 defend
 our


country
 um
 and
 and
 and
 doing
 it
 from
 a


position
 of
 confidence
 is
 where
 I
 think


we
 need
 to
 go.


>> I
 the
 I
 think
 General
 already
 said
 our


idea
 of
 this
 I
 you
 know
 the
 the
 neutral


military
 party
 that
 goes
 in
 to
 separate


two
 waring
 factions
 has
 been
 over
 since


the
 1990s
 and
 it
 was
 probably
 over


before
 we
 realized
 it
 was
 over
 as


experienced
 in
 some
 very
 difficult


places.
 When
 they
 were
 shooting
 at
 me,
 I


realized
 it
 was
 over.


>> Exactly.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we


have
 to
 realize
 is
 that
 there
 may
 be


times
 when
 Canada
 will
 need
 to
 defend


our
 own
 interests
 by
 helping
 to
 resolve


conflicts
 in
 other
 part
 of
 the
 world.


But
 we
 need
 to
 take
 those
 decisions
 in


view
 of
 how
 is
 it
 contributing
 and
 what


is
 the
 most
 effective
 way
 to
 do
 that.


And
 I
 think
 what
 we've
 learned
 certainly


in
 the
 last
 few
 decades
 is
 that
 strong


capable
 military
 forces
 that
 have
 the


mandate,
 the
 rules
 of
 engagement,
 the


equipment
 to
 defend
 themselves
 and


defend
 others
 maybe
 need
 to
 be
 deployed,


but
 that's
 not
 peacekeeping.
 And
 we


should
 let
 go
 of
 the
 idea
 that
 there
 is


somehow
 this
 magic
 third
 party


interpositional
 blue
 parade
 peacekeeper


out
 there
 that
 we
 can
 go
 back
 to
 being


because
 that
 does
 not
 exist
 anymore.


>> Christian,
 what
 does
 peacekeeping
 come


out
 of?
 1956
 the
 sewers
 crisis.
 Why
 did


then
 why
 did
 Pearson
 effectively
 invent


the
 concept
 to
 avoid
 the
 superpowers


from
 going
 to
 war,
 possibly
 going
 to


nuclear
 war?
 Because
 we
 would
 all
 lose


if
 that
 was
 going
 to
 happen.


Peacekeeping
 was
 never
 about
 making
 the


world
 a
 better,
 nicer
 place.
 But
 I
 think


politically
 we
 turned
 it
 into
 that


because
 that's
 a
 cheap
 and
 easy
 thing
 to


do.
 What
 did
 we
 do
 after
 World
 War
 II?


We
 invested
 in
 real
 capabilities
 that


we,
 as
 both
 Wayne V
 and
 General
 Era
 have


pointed
 out,
 deployed
 to
 Europe.
 Why
 did


we
 deploy
 them
 to
 Europe?
 Because
 what


did
 we
 learn
 in
 the
 first
 half
 of
 the


20th
 century?
 That
 the
 Europeans
 like
 to


fight
 their
 wars
 right
 down
 to
 the
 last


Canadian.
 And
 I
 point
 that
 out
 because


look,
 we're
 learning
 it
 today
 with


Ukraine.
 What
 happens
 in
 Europe
 doesn't


stay
 in
 Europe.
 It
 has
 effects
 on
 the


whole
 world.
 It
 has
 effects
 on
 the


instability
 that
 we're
 seeing
 in
 the


Arctic
 today.
 And
 so
 it
 is
 an
 this
 these


are
 in
 investments
 in
 stability.
 These


are
 investments
 in
 defending
 the


democracy
 and
 the
 way
 of
 life
 that
 we


cherish.


>> If
 I
 can
 just
 add
 to
 Christian's
 point.


So
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half
 ago,
 80th


anniversary
 of
 the
 Normandy
 landings.
 I


was
 there
 on
 Juno
 Beach
 and
 as
 I


reflected
 on
 it,
 I
 I
 I
 realized
 as
 you


know,
 Canada
 at
 the
 spearheaded
 the
 the


first
 amongst
 the
 first
 to
 land
 in


Normandy
 and
 spearheaded
 the
 uh
 the


liberation
 of
 of
 Europe.
 We
 are
 a


country
 capable
 of
 great
 things.
 Uh
 and


we
 have
 done
 great
 things.
 We
 just
 need


that
 confidence
 and
 that
 belief
 in


oursel.
 But
 we
 we
 can
 do
 it.


>> In
 light
 of
 that
 comment,
 I
 want
 to
 give


you
 the
 last
 word
 on
 something
 that
 was


said
 by
 the
 president
 of
 the
 United


States
 the
 other
 day
 in
 which
 he
 said


essentially
 the
 US
 did
 all
 the
 heavy


lifting
 in
 the
 wars
 that
 took
 place


earlier
 this
 century
 and
 Canadian
 and


British
 and
 other
 allied
 troops
 kind
 of


held
 back.
 What
 did
 your
 view
 of
 that?


>> It's
 hard
 not
 to
 take
 it
 personally.
 In


2007
 as
 a
 unit
 commander,
 I
 lost
 10


Canadians
 under
 my
 command.


I've
 known
 many
 more
 who
 were
 killed


over
 there.
 You
 know,
 ranging
 from
 2002


right
 up
 until
 uh
 the
 end
 of
 our


commitment.
 Um
 it
 was
 a
 comment
 designed


to
 spark
 outrage.
 It
 was
 a
 troll.
 We


were
 being
 trolled.
 And
 I
 would
 uh
 I


guess
 my
 message
 to
 my
 fellow
 veterans


would
 be
 don't
 fall
 prey
 to
 the
 troll.


Don't
 fall
 prey
 to
 that
 sense
 of


outrage.
 We
 know
 what
 we
 did.
 Um
 and
 our


American
 colleagues
 who
 stood


shoulder-to-shoulder
 with
 us,
 the
 ones


that
 matter,
 they
 know
 what
 we
 did.
 And


so
 be
 proud
 of
 uh
 of
 your
 service
 there.


You
 did
 everything
 your
 country
 asked


you
 to
 do.


That's
 a
 very
 powerful
 final
 statement


here.
 Okay,
 we
 do
 need
 to
 say
 some
 thank


yous
 before
 we
 sign
 off
 on
 our
 broadcast


here.
 First
 to
 this
 audience,
 by
 the


time
 this
 plays
 on
 television,
 people


may
 have
 forgotten
 that
 it's
 bloody
 cold


out
 there
 today
 and
 yet
 you
 folks
 showed


up
 in
 big
 numbers
 here,
 even
 Phil
 the


bleachers.
 So,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


coming
 out
 today.
 And
 for
 those
 of
 you


who
 stepped
 up
 and
 asked
 questions,
 our


thanks
 to
 you
 as
 well.
 Uh
 to
 the
 folks


here
 at
 Centennial
 College
 and
 the
 DARE


Hub,
 especially
 Michelle
 Irvin,
 Samantha


Glover,
 you
 have
 been
 a
 delight
 to
 work


with.
 Thank
 you
 for
 your
 hospitality.


This
 is
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 set,
 I
 got
 to
 say.


Really
 nice.
 Really
 nice.
 To
 our
 TVO


staff
 and
 production
 crew,
 many
 thanks


as
 always.
 You
 guys
 always
 bring
 it
 on


the
 road
 and
 make
 it
 look
 so
 easy.
 To


Hillary
 Clark,
 who
 produced
 TVO
 today


live,
 Hillary,
 if
 the
 premier
 were
 here,


he'd
 say
 you're
 a
 champion.
 As
 always
 to


the
 Wilson
 Foundation
 and
 its
 benefactor


Red
 Wilson
 for
 enabling
 everything
 that


we
 have
 done
 on
 this
 series
 and


everybody
 in
 this
 room
 today
 is
 here


free
 of
 charge
 because
 of
 Red
 Wilson.


And
 now
 thanks
 as
 well
 to
 the
 Jackman


Foundation
 for
 their
 contribution
 as


well.

And
 finally,
 I
 know
 this
 audience
 wants


to
 join
 me
 in
 thanking
 this
 wonderful


trio
 for
 being
 here
 today
 at
 Centennial
