上一期節目當中,我採訪了國共內戰的倖存者高平海先生。節目播出幾天之後,我的書看見在大陸北慶。這件事情並不讓我覺得意外,因為高先生的節目中,已經談過什麼是政治的邏輯和歷史的必然性。經掉一本12年前出版,已經印刷過幾百萬冊的書。這個結果,也不讓我覺得憤怒或者悲哀。我的第一反應是一種力量感。 因為高先生的節目中談的是人心,他反思戰爭的殘酷,思念母親和故土。是這樣的感情,在涼岸的很多普通人當中引起了強烈的共鳴。這種感情是無形的,但是它有萬鈞之力。 看见那本书所记录的也是同样的力量,就是人性怎么从束缚中解放出来,而且不断突破障碍的过程。这是2003年到2012年之间,看见中所记录的十年中国巨变背后的最大推动力。它能够说明一个国家的失败,也能够说明一个国家的成功,它能解释过去,也能结实将来。 I once thought that if I had to choose a moment as the starting point for me to become a journalist, I would choose May 17, 2003. I stood in a strange dark corridor and heard a huge chain of iron being opened. After the door opened, I still remember that the daylight lamp flashed a few times and suddenly lit up. I saw dozens of empty chairs on the bed. The backpack was pulled on the ground, the chairs were folded and the corners were facing the sky. The dates on each chair are April 17th. 他记录了当天不是简单的撤离,而是恐慌的逃命。这就是天井,北京市人民医院的急诊区,非典期间全球最大的医院地中心。 The sky is surrounded by buildings. There is an empty space in the middle called the sky. A lid was added on it, and it looks like this now. I entered Tianjin, and it was the first time it was opened after it was closed. The chief of the emergency department of this hospital, Zhu Xihong, showed me the small blackboard. There are 22 patients on the blackboard. We can see that the patients who do not have a fever are only one. 2, 3, only these 3 are not feverish. The remaining 19 patients are feverish. Or more are directly pneumonia. At that time, we all wrote that these patients were SARS patients. 我記得當時看著這塊小黑板心裡想這是歷史我在記錄歷史這是2003年非典疫情被瞞爆的證據當時北京市第一例非典病人就在這裡和其他病人混雜在一起我站在天井中環視四周這只是幾棟樓之間的一個空地上面加了一個蓋完全封閉白天也開著燈沒有窗只有一個中央空調的通氣口 我从天井走出去,沿着这条路通往放射壳,通往住院部,病毒随之辐射。而天井关闭之后,又通过发烧门诊,向整个北京扩散。十天当中,有将近一万人来这里看发烧门诊。 There was no place to sit. On the empty floor, many people were moving small benches. One of them was a member of the health system and his wife. The high fever made them shiver. They almost couldn't sit on the bench. When I was standing there, they both had passed away. One of them was leaving his son in primary school. These chairs have been tainted by the sun They are empty They look like a bunch of dumb people in front of the Ministry of Health Until today, many people still say that this is a reporter who reported the incident This kind of statement always makes me feel very ashamed. Because I was a host of a live broadcast before. A small screw on a machine, just reporting the numbers and measures announced by the government. I didn't learn to doubt. On April 22, I was following the transition of the surveillance center by accident. 才听说了人民医院的听见我们刚刚跟急救15号车回来就看到现场已经有6辆车待命准备了去人民医院接着一批疑似的病人到政府指定的地团医院去我们将继续跟踪开设这个大型的等线过程因为我们急诊污染了但是那个时候还不知道是污染了多少所以收进了病房了 超病房 她也發病了一個又傳好幾個我問王院長怎麼了他說天井出事了那是我第一次聽到天井我隱隱約約知道什麼地方不對勁包括這一輛車上裝著29個病人但是這是怎麼回事我沒有問因為車馬上就要走而且當時這不是我的報道任務我就走了我就忘了 直到三天之后,我们的车再次经过人民医院。这座有85年历史的三级假等医院被整体关闭。就在黄色的隔离线之后,有三个护士坐在台阶上,谁都不说话。这座医院222个人感染,包括了93位医护人员。我们停车看着他们。这是幸存者之间的互相主事。 I took a photo of Wang Xiaopeng and made a gesture for them. The car drove away. I went back to the office and reported this question. I remember I told the producer Zhang Jie that I had to do it. I don't care if this system will approve or how it will evaluate. Because I have experienced its incompetence and collapse. Since the first unidentified non-faceted pneumonia patient found in Beijing on March 5, The whole sample room has been stopped during the non-faceted period. Leaders don't go to work, and the program is rescheduled. I sent it to the first-line reporter, the jacket I was wearing. Maybe they thought this kind of slippery cloth couldn't catch the virus. We have six people, but only sent us five stitches. This was a life-saving needle at the time. But the driver was not in the edit, so there was no needle. 我们的录音室刘畅就把自己的让给了他,把门反锁起来。我们回来的时候,他正在给他的话筒套上那种女士的丝袜,做一种很土的消毒。他掉着烟,然后眼睛在烟雾里面迷起来。他说了一句说,该死掉朝上。 It means "life and death are predestined". This is a very rough and very real sentence. In my opinion, it represents all heroism in the extreme situation at that time. So when a system collapses, I trust the first line. I made this program for them. Because I can also rely on the control center to wear double isolation clothes. The doctors and nurses in the People's Hospital are together with the patients. They don't have isolation clothes, no masks. The difference between the cleaning area and the pollution area is just a thread drawn on the ground. How do you protect? We rely on the medical system to protect us. It's a meaty price. The price of meat is paid by a living person. There are 62 patients in the emergency department of the People's Hospital. 24 people are infected. During my interview, the nurse, Wang Jing, died of infection. When I went to her house, 她丈夫给我念手机里的三条短信。第一条,是妻子说:床前的花开了,我会好起来。第二条,是跟她说:你回去吧,你不能倒下,你是这个世界上我唯一依靠的人。因为当时她丈夫不能够进医院探视她,所以每天站在医院的门口,那个世界上离她最近的地方守着她。 When the last message came, Wang Jing knew he was in trouble. He told his husband, "You must wear a red belt. You must be safe in this year." He was reading the message while suffering. 但是隔壁的屋子里,他们六岁的女儿一句话不说,坐在床上给她妈妈叠幸运信。她叠得很慢,叠完一颗,小心翼翼地放在最上面。她的房门上贴着一个白纸,上面是孩子歪歪扭扭的笔迹,写着"妈妈爱我,我爱妈妈"。 采访完,我们几个人在车里一言不发,又是2003年的春夏之交。北京满城乌云,暴雨就要下来了。什么是政治?我不关心政治,我只关心人。只不过,人的命运反映出了政治。 非典之後,當時的新任總理溫家寶到央視來座談。這是中央政府和新聞界溝通理念的常規方式。我也被通知在場。我記得他發言的時候說,記者要對人民有感情。在交流環節我站起來,我說我自認我們有。 但是《新闻调查》一年52期节目当中,有时候有三分之一的节目不能够播出。我说的是,从1996年开始,《新闻调查》第一期节目做的就是调查性报道。但是,不但被避,而且影响到了整个栏目的生死存亡。 所以我要说的是,这不是感情能够解决的。温家宝的回答是这么说的。他说有一年他去地方视察,没有走当地政府安排的路线。在另一条路上,看到一个农民,旁边放了一副棺材。这个老人生了病,没钱看病,只能把自己的棺材板拿出来卖。他从自己的包里面拿了500块钱,给这个老人。 然后说中国大地上的事情是无穷无尽的,不要再一成一尺的得失,要执着。我是这么理解这段话的,就是一个完全垂直、全力高度集中的体制,不可能避免信息的遮蔽,而且会造成惨烈的后果。 Even if he has started from his own power, he must return it to the media. It should belong to their supervision power. Not long after this meeting, in 2003, the news survey released a number of slogans. "Look for the truth" The main theme is the construction of the military power. That year, I was on a business trip for more than 150 days. People investigate the four directions, the environment is polluted, and the selection of candidates. The reason you thought there was insufficient evidence was because you didn't know who you were blaming. You thought you could do anything for the company. Before entering the normal judicial process, there was already a conclusion. How could you not be able to stop the election if you went to supervise it? If you think this double standard is wrong, why are you implementing it? Can you see the tiger's ears growing apart from 50 meters? Oh, I don't know. 2003 was the year of the original investigation of the investigative report on the true meaning of the new investigation. 这不是来自于政府的复权,而是它暂时交还了一部分本该属于媒体的权利。这样做,是来自于2003年深刻的非典危机之后的全民反思。 If there is another crisis like this, the emergency department of the People's Hospital 能打赢吗?如果按照现在的布局,现在的条件我想如果再打的话还是会失败我们把对朱季红的采访放进了新闻调查的片头里面作为一个警示,也作为一个对我们这个行业的自我提醒但是20年后,当新冠病毒席卷而来的时候 这句话已经从节目的片头中消失连同那句探寻事实真相我不认为任何制度能够强加给一个人创造力创造力是被解放出来的 After the 2003 The producer Zhang Jie of our show This means that I and two other The reporter has his own team We have the right to choose Also have the right to participate in the editing With such a system I may now report some Possible choices 13 years 13 years 15 years 12 years 12 years 5th period 4th period 5th period How many of you committed suicide after the crime? I am the second victim All of you You didn't ask for the protection and treatment of the image. Why? Because we have to face society and give society a real feeling Actually, we are not that bad We are not bad people In the prison in Hebei, I interviewed 11 women who were killed by a man 四年前,我想過做這個選題。當時我在全國復聯的報告當中看到一個數字,說中國的女性重心犯中,殺夫的比例者極高,有些監獄接近了70%。當時我看到的只是報告的一行角柱。現在,我看見了他們。閹靖在丈夫要掐死女兒的時候,她用了槍。手頭還不夠進去。 I'm afraid of being robbed. I'm sorry. Anhua used a knife when her husband was about to hurt her. What do you think she's like when she's drunk? She's cruel. Dou Xiaohua used a steel stick when her husband threatened to kill her whole family. You can't do that. You're stupid. She suddenly cut the knife into the hair, right? I suddenly gave you a pill You don't care about the specific things anymore? Don't care about why Because you grew up, you died I should die when I grow up Have you ever resisted for so many years? No, I have never resisted This is the last time, this is the first time 他们都经历了长期的家庭暴力,没有得到帮助在2005年的中国,一个男人可以殴打一个女人强暴他的姐妹,侵害他的孩子,只因为他是她的丈夫我去监狱的时候是跟一位心理专家同行的他是在海外研究过受虐妇女综合症的专家但是法庭上没有人传唤他作为专家证人因为我们没有这样的法律依据 这11位女犯中,只有安华一个人得到了解刑,因为她的一只眼睛被丈夫用玻璃瓶扎瞎了,而其他人没有伤痕证据。在法庭审理的时候,有一个人曾经想提自己遭受的家庭暴力,被检察官立声喝断,说:"替你拉家常呢?说你杀人的事儿。" 咱们国家不考虑那些,为什么不能考虑呢?因为法律没有那样规定你现在只能够按照这个现有的条文来哎呀,对对,依法吧我去探望这些女犯的家庭 男人死了,女人在监狱,留下的是家中没有人照管的老人和孩子。河北的冬天非常寒冷,但她们连一块霉都买不起。你想过她的样子吗?我没见过,想不出来。你看,她想不出来。我见过你妈妈,你长得跟她很像。是啊,跟她一模一样,是吧?嗯。我还在医院,跟孩子比较好。 I can't even touch her. I can't even touch her. I don't want anything. I just want her to come back soon. I want her to have a child. When I die, I will give her a gift. The following events are not in this film.管他孩子到我死的時候我給他能賠個零接下來發生的事情沒有編到這個片子裡面 这个老人不断地摇着我的手,不断地说:你让他回来,你让他回来。突然,他往后一倒,从小板凳上摔下去了。我当时跪在水里面搂着他,我觉得他眼睛里面已经没有任何声音了。我当时想大声呼救。那个小女孩很冷静,她指了指她外婆那个胸口的口袋。我从里面掏出塑料救星丸,放在老人的嘴里面。 I only knew that the child was so calm. It's because he's done this many times. I've been hearing this sentence on this show. You let him come back. Why don't you go back? You go back and say it. I will come back to you But I am just a reporter How can I let them come back? I can only take these two poor children Children who don't even have the money to visit their mothers I want to go out and beg you I want to go out and beg you I want to beg you I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Why are you looking for your mom? When I recorded this part on camera, I saw a female police officer standing next to me. She turned her face around and wiped her eyes with a police uniform sleeve. The experts, judges and prosecutors I interviewed in these programs were all women. As for later, someone said, "I care about women because you women." And there was a female speaker, "It's not because women care about women, it's because people care about people." I also care about those men and those dead. So I went to find their past and their photos. But the elderly in the family almost destroyed their photos. The empty bottles in the yard are almost the only evidence of their existence. Only Dou Xiaohua's husband's brother took out a broom from behind the door. A sandal was swept down from the roof. He gave me a wet eye when he gave it to me. He said he didn't want to see it for eight years. I was surprised that I didn't see a face of a murderer. It was an ordinary person with a smile. And in the memory of his wife, there was not only anger, but also a kind of complexity and delusion. I saw it once and suddenly I was like, "Do you love me?" I said, "What do you mean by love? I don't understand." He will tell you that he loves me I don't know what love is Do you think he wants to get rid of it? Of course he wants to get rid of it How can you judge? Because he said he didn't want this to happen He said he couldn't control himself Sometimes I do it to hurt others Do you miss him? Yes What do you miss? I miss when he smiles. When he smiles at you, it's like he's given you the world. The scar on this child's face was caused by his father's three-legged kick. It was between his nose and eyes. 这就是家庭暴力的残酷性,它是在伤害和爱之间的反复交错。在这个节目中,有专家说,成熟法律体系的国家90%以上的家暴,如果第一次发生的时候干预得当的话,此后可以不再发生。警方可以逮捕施暴者。 法官可以签发紧急保护令,这些政策传递的信号是:你的行为是社会不能容忍的,这对于施暴者也是保护,防止他们被自己种下的暴力反噬。节目播出之后,有人说:你们的节目太边缘了,这些人只是农村的失败者。但暴力不分成小,只分看没看见。2000年,我在湖南卫视的时候采访,当时中国年度新锐人物李阳, 11年之後,他騎在妻子的背上,揪著他的頭髮,猛撞地板。你有考慮到說孩子就在旁邊呢?剛好沒有開考慮。那一瞬間給人的感覺確實是人性的惡。對,是,人性的魔鬼,就是魔鬼完全打開了。李昂當時的妻子Kim之所以接受採訪,是因為她看了我們那期採訪女子監區的節目。她說,我不知道在中國有那麼多女人這麼活著。 If I remain silent, I will not be able to protect my daughter. The statistics of the National Women's Federation in 2011 show that nearly 300 million women in 30% of the family are subject to domestic violence. This is just a data that has been publicly investigated. From 2005 onwards, every two meetings, I will pay attention to the subject of anti-violence. 11年之後,中國第一部反家庭暴力法頒布的時候,全國人大法工委的一位負責人發短信給我。他說:你曾經寫過,在這個世界上沒有任何制度能夠承諾婚姻幸福,但是應該有一個制度能夠儘量避免極端的悲劇發生。現在,我們有了。 我發消息問監獄裡女犯的情況得到的答复是安華減刑回家了但豆小花瘋了我相信當天採訪她的時候她那種激烈又恍惚的狀態已經是崩潰的前兆豆小花判處思緩之後已經服刑了8年但她不相信丈夫死了她不會死的為什麼因為什麼呀她那把火殺死 I am so sorry for her. I am so sorry for her. I don't want her to die. I couldn't go home. But she still has her parents and kids. So I continue to be a migrant who wanders the country, a mental patient and an old farmer. 他們不是我策劃出來的,更像是被一根鐵鏈從地底下一環一環拉出來的。這些沉默的人,我不光想看見他們,我還想感覺到他們。節目播出之後,崔健來了一趟我們辦公室。我們不認識他,他來只是因為看了這個節目,心裡不平靜,要來聊一聊,什麼叫人。 就是一個人面對別人的痛苦,做不到無動於衷。這是一切社會改良的基礎。尤其是在2005年,經濟高速發展,社會鴻溝迅速擴大,充滿了緊張張力的中國。這些剪播了之後,有一天我在路上碰到一位新聞調查的前同事。 他说:我们以前做的节目都是大国的握手,江总书记在安徽。你看看你现在做的,都已经调到了新浪新闻最底下最边缘的地方去了。天天黄嘟嘟,你下一步是不是要做同性恋了? I'm serious My name is Dawei I'm a gay I'm also a self-infecting person You know that if this kind of scene is played on the TV Your life and your family will be affected I just want to face this scene with my real identity 這是央視從1958年成立以來他的屏幕上第一次出現一位同性戀者直面鏡頭他不是在請求憐憫或者寬容而是希望被當成是一個人而不是一個髒東西 而在1997年之前,他可能會因為公開自己的性傾向而入獄,罪名是流氓罪。即使在2005,我最記得這節目的時候,在青島,我見到過一個與他相同處境的男孩。他從外地到青島的醫院尋求治療,醫生拒絕給他治,說妓女我可以治,你不行。 He knelt down and the doctor said, "Don't you feel ashamed?" This sense of shame is so profound. When I interviewed, many people couldn't even say the three words of sympathy. Only say this kind of person. I also told my mother, "If I knew he was this kind of person, I would pinch him when he was born." I just want to be free as long as I am not like this. Yi Fei took the money from his home to learn piano for him. He went to receive treatment and was worried. Professor Zhang Meichuan told me that he knew someone who had received this treatment. The result was that he was a monk. He no longer had any desire for communication. He no longer had any desire. 他痊愈了。按照當時中國衛生部相對保守的統計,中國有500萬到1000萬同性戀者,大部分人選擇結婚。我採訪了一位妻子,她告訴我,結婚後丈夫從不親吻她,她因為自卑去看心理醫生。九年之後,她才發現丈夫是同性戀。 That night, she heard a loud noise upstairs. I thought she had committed suicide. I ran upstairs. I thought I didn't need anything. As long as she was alive, that would be enough. When I went upstairs, I saw the lights on the attic were all out. She was lying there alone. I felt so sad that I just patted her on her back. I felt like there was a lot of tears on her face. She said, "I shouldn't have gotten married. I shouldn't have gotten married." She said, "I hurt a woman. This is the pain I've had in my life." Zhang Beichuan had investigated 1,300 gay people. 77% were extremely painful. 34% were violent and wanted to commit suicide. 38% were insulted and violent. His investigations were one by one. Many of them could contact him by the phone number of someone in the public toilet. This is the only place where the same-sex couple could meet. Zhang Bei Chuan was the only person they could trust in the dark. Can you understand why people have always called them abnormal? Because they have a very backward understanding. This backward understanding is that "Hate should be subordinate to reputation." Treat ignorance as purity, treat beauty as virtue, treat prejudice as principle. In April, 2001, the new version of the Chinese mental disorder classification and diagnosis standard also removed the same-sex chain from the disease classification. This means that the same-sex chain is no longer a disease. I slowly realized the weight of these programs in so many years.  这位现成老中医在一个保守文化中长大的人他会怎么看这个群体我爸头都没抬跟我说这事跟我没关系这事跟我没关系我认为这是我听到的最好的答案在你的理解理想当中这样一个群体在这个世界上应该是一个什么样的位置没有什么特殊的位置就是它的位置现在有一个特殊的位置 我希望他这个特殊位置消失 《廬山煙雨遮江潮》,味道千般恨不小。《道德还来别无事》,《廬山煙雨遮江潮》。后来我的节目给他惹了很多麻烦。他不见得赞成我的节目,但他容忍。孙总退休那天,我在留言簿上写下那首诗,送还给他。 我評價一個人不在於他是不是體制內的,而在於他是不是一個人。2005年,我們節目播出的時候,執政黨的理念叫以人為本。它的政治哲學曾經是階級鬥爭,現在第一次把「人」這個字放在了核心。什麼叫以人為本?就是人不是工具,人就是目的。 去年我很惦记已经80岁的张美川教授给他写了一封信,但是他无法回复。同性恋在20年之后又成了敏感词。这让我想起来,张教授告诉过我,有一位自杀的同性恋者留给他一封信,在信中曾经写过:"这世界是美好的,请用善与爱去寻觅。" 善与爱不是怜悯,是把一个人放在这里,像他一样活一遍。即使你现在身居高位,但如果有一天你失去权势的时候,你不想被当成是一个东西,而是一个人,那你跟他就是一样的,尊严。不可能,也不应该来自于谁的赐予,而是应该属于每一个人的权利。 但是什么叫权力?很多年里我都不知道。它是写在白纸黑字上。我学过,我写过,我背过,但只是用来考试。我理解它,跟我报到两会有很直接的关系。2006年,我收到通知,让我去开会,说新闻联播里面要开一个专栏,叫《柴靖两会观察》。我們再次感謝您的觀察 我說我不願意,我知道什麼叫兩會觀察,我見過。路過人民大會堂的時候,有一位女記者,穿著紅西裝,手裡拿著一個套紅的畫筒。在那個雨雪天氣剛剛結束,大風剛刮起來的時候,她動得直咄咄,把大衣夾在兩個腿中間,對著鏡頭一邊撩頭髮,一邊一邊在那裡說。三月的北京春意盎然。 I don't want to suffer that. But I have no choice. This is a mission. The mission of the editor is to write a good script. The mission of the human rights representative is to read the script written by the editor. What about my mission? I am responsible for raising that microphone. 我看见社会主义新农村的果盘摆得整整齐齐,代表们拉着农民的手说,日子过得好吗?出门的时候我想聊几句,申季兰脸色很难看,把手一甩说,那屋里盐的还不够吗? 在网上人们总是在嘲讽沈季兰从来不投任何反对票那是我第一次意识到人家也不舒服当时我想的是赶紧应付完差事 我回家了我当然正在给我爸办电动自行车的牌照需要办赞助证 那房子呢我们是租的还需要这个房主的货口本 还需要去封台去拿那我爸就嫌烦了 说我不办了 我回山西去 我媽一邊摘韭菜,一邊說最怕的其實是老了以後病了,然後沒有醫保,那就還得回去看。我當然想,我一個正在新聞聯播裡面,每天報導全國最高政治會議的記者。 这个事儿到底跟我的生活有没有什么关系所以第二天我去找我的这个上姐跟她说我能不能把报道的地方改在我们家小区我记得摄像机架起来的时候没有一个人理我后来是那个摆煎饼摊的大姐她对我最好 然後他有點扭捏,他說:這個兩會這個事我們能說嗎?我說:當然可以啊!然後他就對著那個煎餅攤那個玻璃把頭髮攏了攏,就說的沒有停下來,一直在說他孩子上學太貴的事。之後修車的田師傅或者小賣部那個王大哥就都來說,不管是藥費啊還是房價啊。 直到我們都已經拍完了要走了那個帶著紅袖章的那個聯防隊的那個大爺又來了他說你看我能不能跟兩會說幾句話說一說沒有人善養我的事當時我手上只有一個沒有線的話筒但是也說不出來拒絕的話所以我就舉著那個話筒對著他讓他說話 这是我两会报道的开始但坦率地讲那时候我还停留在一个就是反映老百姓心声上情下达的那种记者角色里面我没有理解什么叫两会而且动不动就是跟大家一块看谁手举的高谁能采访个部长或者采访几个明星委员经常一边踩一边听深奥的记者说咱们采访这人是谁呀 我還記得總理接召開會的時候,我報導的時候順嘴就來一句,叫萬人空相。回憶中我在日記裡面寫,我說,小柴,就處你敢這麼用這個成語,將來這個殺人放火的事都能幹得出來。 我是出生在1976年我的第一首詩是寫給雷鋒叔叔的我的小學作文寫的是平地一聲春雷響 四人幫被打倒了我以為我把這些忘了其實沒有我以為我已經從我的採訪當中學到了什麼叫公民其實這些名字對我來說還消化不了我理解的公民不僅僅是具有中華人民共和國國籍的 He expressed his views independently, but was not arrogant. He expressed his political obedience, but was not pessimistic. He actively participated in the policies of the country. Seeing the weak know sympathy, seeing the evil know anger. This is what I think he is a real citizen. What kind of world do you want? I want a world where the Constitution gives me all the power. 所以我不太相信人性的自覺你這人得靠有所激勵有所逼迫你才能把一個事給幹下去就像2007年兩會的時候當時全國人大有一個很新的政策說市場媒體邀請他們進入會議現場《新京報》南方周末就來了那他們可以拿到所有的代表的委員的手機號碼而且人大不允許他們說無可奉告這四個字 I remember I praised a representative, I said you dare to speak the truth. He said, it was not forced by you. By 2008, I felt that I had already started to do a new survey in the two sessions. Because I can interview all the people I want to interview there. No need to review to anyone, no need to post any postings. 因為在短短的會議期間所有的人不再是官員他是代表這是一個身份他必須服從人大新聞局的這樣一個規則的安排2009年我被調到了兩會的分組審議會場我第一次去想兩會是什麼代表是誰他們坐在這幹嗎這些最基礎的問題我花了四年的時間才去想 我的同事说:这有必要问吗?我说:有啊!不信我们来问问自己:我是谁?中央台是干嘛的?所以第一天直播,我就请导播切一个空椅子的画面,说:子路问孔子:您从政的话第一件事情是什么?孔子说:毕业正名乎! 所以這些空空蕩蕩的椅子就是憲法所賦予代表的知情參與表達監督的權利今天全國人大主席團通過了一項報告我也知道我說的在很多人看來只是正確的廢話我在說話的時候我都聽得到演播室裡面主持人關掉耳機正在聊天 但是,這件事情就像談戀愛一樣,跟別人其實沒有太多的關係,就是你的自處之道。我印象最深的是3月8號,浙江代表團圍繞著金融危機的分組審議。開始之前, 庄奇船,那位企业家,在那靠着栏杆抽烟,然后我问他,我说你等会说什么?他说,带着四笑肥笑的表情,他说,那还不是听你们央视的,你们怎么导我们怎么演?我说您等会演自己就行。他说,我敢说,你敢播吗? 我说今天我们直播,你是代表,您对自己的言论负责就可以了。这场直播的预定时间是8分钟。直播一开始,他和另外一位叫邱继宝的代表就吵起来了,在争论危机当中政府跟市场之间的关系。8分钟一直没有停,我的耳机里面没有人喊停。 编导给我发了一个短信说播出线沸腾了但我听到在我身后站两个同行在讲说这下中央台倒大没了他们想拍发言结果吵起来了就这样那场直播延续到40分钟然后我把吵架的双方请到镜头面前说这样播出去你们会感到尴尬吗其中一位回答说尴尬就不要写建议了有争论才有共识谁有理谁就是精英 直播结束之后,我进了电梯,他也进来了。然后他说,第一次啊,我说什么第一次。他说,我们开始有了真正的议会性了。 這也是我最後一年被安排做兩回節目但臨走的時候我帶走了一樣紀念品就是一根玉米這也是我最後一年被安排做兩回節目但臨走的時候我帶走了一樣紀念品就是一根玉米 当年我在做直播的时候,有一个黑影冲过镜头,拽着中央这根玉米,然后又大踏步的从镜头面前穿过去了。全场的人都吃惊,这个人是东北的一位代表叫老毛。他带来这个玉米是为了在开会的时候让大家都摸一摸,说良家必须长,不然对不起奴命。这对他来说不是道具,他也不是到电视台来演戏的。 现在十几年过去了,老猫已经去世了,庄启传也去世了。但这根玉米还在,他对我的提醒是,在这个世界上很多事情是有人相信才会存在。 因为我在新闻调查了六年嘛所以做的大部分是调查性报道就有一个前世纪的概念觉得新闻有正面和负面的区别我觉得我是到2008年才意识到新闻不分正面负面只有真伪之别那一年是新闻界的大事奥运和地震 大地震发生的时候,我当时在国外,花了四十多个小时,然后辗转才回到北京。在北京机场的时候,台里告诉我说已经不允许记者去现场了。我说那我就在北京机场等,等你们同意为止。有人问我说,你是为了一个百年不遇的大新闻才回来的吗?我没有回答他这句话。在回来飞机上,我衬衫的胸口里面放了一张从报纸上撕下来的照片。 上面是大地震当中遇难的一个孩子的遗体。然后父母在身边。这个父亲脸色苍白,在雨中抬头望着天,闭着眼睛。这种情感我没有办法用语言来表达。我只是说,我需要在 当时的新闻频道只有24小时的滚动新闻,新闻调查也取消了。所以跟非典恰恰相反,这是全民动员的时候。每个人都是螺丝钉,在新闻当中你必须言思合缝,情绪一律。就像发给我的这个T恤上后面印的字,抗震救灾。这是一种情绪的要求。我理解,我也完成,但之后我想做我要做的。 上集问:那你要拍谁?我说:谁都行。他说:你拍什么?我说:我不知道。绵羊市九州体育馆,这个因为地震而突然被世人熟知的地方,一度容纳了三万多名问川大建中避难的灾民。 Where are you going? We are going to Baichang. We are going home. Are you from Lei Gu? Yes, I am from Lei Gu. At the entrance of the Mianyang Sports Hall, I followed a couple home. I took their motorbike to the mountain and arrived at the Yangyuping. 从后面看他们的房子是完好的转过去的时候才看到前面的塔我记得山里面下着细雨可以听到鸟叫这是他们第一次看到毁掉的家现在就趁着安心 In the ruins, Mom found a child and gave it to her as a gift on Mother's Day. Father found a tray of incense. The son who went to primary school was in an earthquake. Wen Chao, a good friend of their son, escaped from the second floor when the school collapsed. His mother was in a disaster. In the ruins, someone found a newborn kitten. Mom disappeared. Wen Chao took care of her. We fed the kitten with milk. The kitten followed wherever she went. She can't eat anything when I first came here. Many people said she couldn't survive. Do you think so? Yes, I do. But I remember the biggest thing. Why? She is a dog. This moment may explain why the station asked me to attend the "Earthquake" party. I refused. The director arranged me to recite a poem, saying that it was written for the earthquake. I said I know. I don't object to it. I don't object to reciting either. I just object to the arrangement. Because this is a kind of offense to real feelings. Xiaohan, hurry up and get it for you. Xiaohan, I'll get it for you. 100 is in the black. 100 red. 100 red, right? 100 black. 100 black, okay. I am standing in a very far place during this period. The camera is by my side. We look at the trees and the people sitting under the trees from a distance. The mountain is further away. I can hear the sound of the water dripping from the leaves after the rain. I can hear the night song. When my son was in trouble, he was in a state of mind when he first started playing chess. So I can't stand it. I want the victim to feel grateful. Disaster can break the boundary between people and me. Previously, as a reporter, I always limited your participation and expression. But after the earthquake, there are only a few people in this village. After the game, we had a meal together. They asked me to sit down. Find out from that ruins that there is no stolen high-class wine. There will be a reason. I don't drink alcohol, so this cup of wine is like burning fire in my stomach. There is a saying in Sichuan, "fire falls on the foot." It means that you know what pain is when you suffer from such a skin and oil. So I am grateful to these people. I didn't suffer this pain. But they let me stay. [speaking Chinese] [speaking Chinese] 我剛聽的時候一愣 因為只有我們家裡人才這麼叫我這個村子裡面老人家83歲了耳朵背 脾氣很大但他說他唱山歌唱得好但是他是絕不肯開口唱的他跟我呢 是我聽不懂他 他也聽不懂我但每一次我路過他他跟大貓兩個人在烤火的時候呢我就叫一聲爺爺 然後他就刺牙一樂當我們走的那天 他突然来了站在那一句话不说张口就唱幸好我们手忙脚乱给录下了他唱完就走了把这段歌留给了我们 (singing) 就这几句歌我们把它放在了片子里面我也不知道他唱的是什么我只听得懂他在唱什么什么杨柳萍隔着那一阵子我睡觉前或者我醒来的时候我心里面就是这几句你起一落 我的解说很平淡,他说的只是这些人有的时候很有信心,吃着方便面在梨花树底下搭帐篷,有的时候又低落下来,在篝火边上哭泣。有的时候他们把孩子的照片锁在箱子里,有的时候摩托车一响又以为他回来了。 这就是生活,生活不需要有什么主题,真是自有万俊之力。我记得节目播完之后,西门桃莎原来的一个制片人,也是和尚的导演夏俊,他跟我说,这些节目是你的成年礼,因为你以前老忘不了自己,这一次你忘了。 2008年,有人批评我不够歌颂,有人讽刺我做正面报道。但对我来说,这一年交给我的是,不管外面多么罗补宣天,我不唱赞歌,也不唱战歌。真正的歌者,唱出人心底的沉默。 那時候我還不知道,很快我會丟到工作,時代的巨變來了。但是,2008年,讓我為他做好了準備。一群人,一個片子,一本書,可以失去,可以毀掉,但無形的東西卻會留下來。他不反抗,但你也不可能剝奪。
