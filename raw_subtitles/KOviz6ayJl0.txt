[Speaker 0]:  hello，
[Speaker 0]:  everyone。
[Speaker 0]:  welcome to cork says，
[Speaker 0]:  i'm core。
[Speaker 0]:  i apologized for the delay。
[Speaker 0]:  this episode was originally planned for last weekend，
[Speaker 0]:  but it was postponed due to the flu。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  our channel isn't primarily a news channel。
[Speaker 0]:  so after careful consideration，
[Speaker 0]:  i decided to still complete this topic。
[Speaker 0]:  on january twenty eight，
[Speaker 0]:  a piece of news broke that was quite unfavorable to the CCP australian prime minister。
[Speaker 0]:  albany stated that for national security reasons，
[Speaker 0]:  australiacommitted to reclaiiming，
[Speaker 0]:  the darwin port，
[Speaker 0]:  which was leased to chineinese company，
[Speaker 0]:  ninety nine years and bringing it back under australian control。
[Speaker 0]:  the chinese sides response was quite intriguing shelchian。
[Speaker 0]:  the chinese ambassador to australia merely stated that he would protect chinese legitimate interest overseas and hope that the issue would be properperresresved ved as monstate ate australia's welcoming attitude towards ineineinveinvement。
[Speaker 0]:  it didn't seem as confronfrontational as one might expect just one day later。
[Speaker 0]:  on the other side of the world，
[Speaker 0]:  the supreme court of panama announced the concession agreement for two port signed in nineteen ninety ty by huhutchsson port holdings，
[Speaker 0]:  a subsidiary of lecochshsing CK hutchson holdings was illegal and temporarily placed under the management of merse group。
[Speaker 0]:  didn't the CCP keep pressuingly caushing over the port issue。
[Speaker 0]:  now it seems the dust has settled。
[Speaker 0]:  panama has effectively ended the deal from the ground up，
[Speaker 0]:  no matter how much the CCP complains。
[Speaker 0]:  ts useless hutchsson can still pursue international arbitration and may received some compensation，
[Speaker 0]:  but the c CP attempmpto exert pressure on lee ak ushame to gain control of these two ports has essentially failed。
[Speaker 0]:  if you consider these two events as isolated incidents and ordinary business disputes，
[Speaker 0]:  then you might be greatly underestimating the changes that are silently taking place in our society。
[Speaker 0]:  in this episode，
[Speaker 0]:  i want to discuss these port events，
[Speaker 0]:  especially the darwin port issue and a reality that the win in have sociebut，
[Speaker 0]:  but has quietly taken shape。
[Speaker 0]:  whether human society has already entered a prewar state that the silchological and institutional levels let's start with a darwin port incident。
[Speaker 0]: 嗯，
[Speaker 0]:  if you search for related chinese keywords，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll see a deluge of reports on the darwin port incident，
[Speaker 0]:  mostly condemning the australian government for not honouring the contract in portraing，
[Speaker 0]:  china as completely innocent。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  more details are australimissing regarding why the australian government did this，
[Speaker 0]:  the geocrual al maneuvring involved and even crucial information such as the locacial darwin port，
[Speaker 0]:  and it's importortant clearly doesn't help us understand the full picture。
[Speaker 0]:  let me add some background information。
[Speaker 0]:  darwin port is located in darwin，
[Speaker 0]:  the capital of australia's northern territory。
[Speaker 0]:  it is the most important strategic port in north in australia，
[Speaker 0]:  holding a unique position among australi's seventeen national level important ports equivalent to australia's northern gateway。
[Speaker 0]:  it is also the only city in australia to have experience cmodern warfare，
[Speaker 0]:  the famous darwin port arraade during world war ti took place here at that time，
[Speaker 0]:  japanese forces launch more than one hundred arraies on military in civilian facilities in the port over a period of more than a year。
[Speaker 0]:  from this，
[Speaker 0]:  you can understand how important its strategic position is looking at the map alone。
[Speaker 0]:  it seems that the islands of popuwin ughini and the solomon islands are further north。
[Speaker 0]:  but from a military perspective，
[Speaker 0]:  the valtime view of darwin port far outweighs these two locations。
[Speaker 0]:  firstly，
[Speaker 0]:  darwin port is a natural deep water port with good draft in channel conditions，
[Speaker 0]:  capable of accommodating large warships，
[Speaker 0]:  supply ships and ethhibious assault ships year ound without obstruction and without requiring frequendredging。
[Speaker 0]:  what does this mean for the navy？
[Speaker 0]:  it means that warships can continuously enter an excited，
[Speaker 0]:  high frequency。
[Speaker 0]:  in contrast，
[Speaker 0]:  pop in uininy in the solomon islands are shallow small ports within inherently insufficient birth，
[Speaker 0]:  capcapacand and fpid id，
[Speaker 0]:  so they can only service forward out posts and cannot fulfill the central role。
[Speaker 0]:  requiire in milmilitary base。
[Speaker 0]:  kdarwin port has has most complepleairairport railway，
[Speaker 0]:  ghway and port facilities in northern australia。
[Speaker 0]:  this means ans，
[Speaker 0]:  once 's war，
[Speaker 0]:  breaks out roops s el ammunition and spare parts can be continuously ly ansported from mainland australia and deploy to the ppific battlefield。
[Speaker 0]:  this location is naturally the best assembly maintenance supply in staging base for the US australian joint forces。
[Speaker 0]:  this is why the japanese army spent。
[Speaker 0]:  so much effort attacking this place during the war，
[Speaker 0]:  understanding this background，
[Speaker 0]:  you can now easily understand this map。
[Speaker 0]:  located next to darwin international airport is the royal australian air force base，
[Speaker 0]:  and here's the hmas cnooar，
[Speaker 0]:  a naval base。
[Speaker 0]:  finally，
[Speaker 0]:  roberts and byrics houses the army，
[Speaker 0]:  all branches of a military are present，
[Speaker 0]:  army navy and airforfornote that these three bases are all red red by the us in australian forces，
[Speaker 0]:  and roberts and baricx is also home to the US marine poore。
[Speaker 0]:  so where are the two ports that have sparked controversy，
[Speaker 0]:  both under the extreme control of the chinese own company language there？
[Speaker 0]:  here，
[Speaker 0]:  one is，
[Speaker 0]:  is called estarm，
[Speaker 0]:  and the others called fill，
[Speaker 0]:  which can be translated as fortss hill or fortified hill。
[Speaker 0]:  because histically，
[Speaker 0]:  it was the location of a battery and observation post。
[Speaker 0]:  let me think about this。
[Speaker 0]:  the only two ports near your most important military basase are controlled by a foreign company。
[Speaker 0]:  but not just any foreign company，
[Speaker 0]:  but china and an xis power that is highly likely to launch a foreign ar in in the future。
[Speaker 0]:  they've ve sigsigned a ty nine year lesaagreement。
[Speaker 0]:  if you were the australian government，
[Speaker 0]:  how would you feel？
[Speaker 0]:  in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  you don't even need to be a military expert。
[Speaker 0]:  anyone with basic military knowledge knows how high the risks are，
[Speaker 0]:  you don't even need to wait until the war starts the prewar preparations alone or enough to make the australian government extremely apprehensive。
[Speaker 0]:  firstly，
[Speaker 0]:  there's the risk of electronic vulnerability。
[Speaker 0]:  if US australian naval vessels leave the base，
[Speaker 0]:  they must pass through the shipping lane opposite east arm，
[Speaker 0]:  which is controlled by language。
[Speaker 0]:  this means that for ninety nine years，
[Speaker 0]:  the US is most crucial military units from nuclear submarines to aircraft carriers will be subjects to continues monitoring by the CCP every time they sell out or return to port。
[Speaker 0]:  the CCP only needs to install so ar listening in signal interception equipment in the dot towers or ships，
[Speaker 0]:  and the acoustic signature and electronic frequencies of US naval vessels will be completely transparent to the CCP。
[Speaker 0]:  secondly，
[Speaker 0]:  there's the delay in operations。
[Speaker 0]:  modern warfare relies on logistics and timing if a conflict truly errups in the south china sea or the taiwan straight darwin court is the lifeline for the US coalition。
[Speaker 0]:  if at that time，
[Speaker 0]:  language uses port maintenance equipment failure or commercial contract disputes as reasons to implement a legal and compliant soft blockade，
[Speaker 0]:  or even create technical obstacles in key shipping lanes，
[Speaker 0]:  then the urgently needed ammunition and fuel with the front lines might have to wait in definitely。
[Speaker 0]:  and this doesn't even account for the even more in cdiast data collection。
[Speaker 0]:  currently，
[Speaker 0]:  the entire ports automated management system and all material flow data are under their control。
[Speaker 0]:  this means that every movement of the coalition forces in the northern territory，
[Speaker 0]:  every crease or decrease in supplies is completely transparent to them。
[Speaker 0]:  considering these three points，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll find that this chinese mil has effectively crippled the military function of darwin port。
[Speaker 0]:  the most important base in norern australia rendering，
[Speaker 0]:  it virtually useless。
[Speaker 0]:  some might say that even if the risk you mention exist，
[Speaker 0]:  it doesn't prove it。
[Speaker 0]:  it will necessarily happen。
[Speaker 0]:  after all，
[Speaker 0]:  language is just a private company。
[Speaker 0]:  it's just a simple commercial transaction。
[Speaker 0]:  regarding this question，
[Speaker 0]:  we can look at it from free perspectives。
[Speaker 0]:  firstly，
[Speaker 0]:  even the most naive western politician knows that there is no truly in the in private enterprise in china。
[Speaker 0]:  any company registered in operating in china，
[Speaker 0]:  with its controlling interest in china cannot refuse any demands from the party，
[Speaker 0]:  including military infiltration in state level。
[Speaker 0]:  espianauage saying that because it's a private company，
[Speaker 0]:  it might not be controlled by the CCP is like saying that always selling equipment to iran and helping them build a surveillance system。
[Speaker 0]:  risking US sanctions is purely a commercial transaction unrelated to the CCP。
[Speaker 0]:  it's simply self deception。
[Speaker 0]:  secondly，
[Speaker 0]:  let's look at the data。
[Speaker 0]:  let's see if language es investment is a sound business decision from a peure commercial perspective。
[Speaker 0]:  this is a population density map of australia from the map。
[Speaker 0]:  we can see that the vast majority of australia's population is concentrated in the southeeastern coastal area。
[Speaker 0]:  in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  the major cities with the largest populations in australia，
[Speaker 0]:  sydney，
[Speaker 0]:  melbourourne，
[Speaker 0]:  canberra，
[Speaker 0]:  brisbane and adelaide basically ally located in adelagide。
[Speaker 0]:  the only exception is locath，
[Speaker 0]:  with two point three eight million people located in the southwest corner of australia，
[Speaker 0]:  the northern territory where darwin is located the northe areas with with lowest population density in australia，
[Speaker 0]:  and indeed，
[Speaker 0]:  the entire western world，
[Speaker 0]:  with one point three，
[Speaker 0]:  five million square kilometre of land。
[Speaker 0]:  it only has two hundred sixty eight people，
[Speaker 0]:  eequivalent zero hundred eight people per square kilometre，
[Speaker 0]:  which one one eighteen of the australian average。
[Speaker 0]:  this might not give you much context。
[Speaker 0]:  it's roughly equivalent to the entire city of shanghai only having just over one thousand residents。
[Speaker 0]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 0]:  over one hundred sixty thousand of these two hundred thousand people are crammed into the capital city of darwin。
[Speaker 0]:  outside of darwin，
[Speaker 0]:  you have to drive more than one thousand five hundred kilometers to encounter the first decent human settlement。
[Speaker 0]:  the reason for such a skiled population distribution is inextricably link to australia's harsh，
[Speaker 0]:  natural and geographical environment。
[Speaker 0]:  looking at a map of australia，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll see that the entire city and it resembles a hollow dona。
[Speaker 0]:  the vast interior is dry ry barn，
[Speaker 0]:  red det desert。
[Speaker 0]:  and the only area is susuitable for human haititation along ong cocoast。
[Speaker 0]:  the southestern coast is particularly favoured because of a mountain range，
[Speaker 0]:  spending thousands of kilometres called the great dividing range represented by the black line on the map。
[Speaker 0]:  this mountain range blocks，
[Speaker 0]:  the moist air from the southern pacific othe trapping rainfall in the southeast corner，
[Speaker 0]:  resulting in furtal soil in a suitable temperate climate。
[Speaker 0]: 对对对，
[Speaker 0]:  now，
[Speaker 0]:  you understand why sydney in melbourne are located along this line，
[Speaker 0]:  as for the northern territory，
[Speaker 0]:  where darwin is located the lack of mountains in its tropical savanet and monsoon climate，
[Speaker 0]:  with only two seasons，
[Speaker 0]:  a dry season that scorching hot in a wet season with torortial rain and devastating。
[Speaker 0]:  cyclones makes 没有法有的事的事有没有意见？
[Speaker 0]:  it unsuitable for large scale agriculture，
[Speaker 0]:  or is the location for a major urban centre。
[Speaker 0]:  this is why，
[Speaker 0]:  despite being further north darwin has a small population。
[Speaker 0]:  this also explains why，
[Speaker 0]:  as mentioned earlier，
[Speaker 0]:  darw's port has a very low commercial ceiling ports and logistics revolve around people。
[Speaker 0]:  sufficient population is necessary for cargo throurouput and port profitability，
[Speaker 0]:  while a port on a southeasterstern coast serves millions of people。
[Speaker 0]:  darwin only serves a few hundred thousand，
[Speaker 0]:  so the cargo volume and commercial value or not，
[Speaker 0]:  even in the same leguing fact，
[Speaker 0]:  according to official australian statistics，
[Speaker 0]:  darwin ports annual fruit is is only forty five million tonns ranking eighteen to twenty in australia，
[Speaker 0]:  less than one percent of the number one rank port headland，
[Speaker 0]:  some might think isn't darwin port further north couldn't imported goods，
[Speaker 0]:  be unloaded there，
[Speaker 0]:  and then transported by rail and road to the more populated cities in the southeast。
[Speaker 0]: 嗯，
[Speaker 0]:  quobut。
[Speaker 0]:  but if understand logistics，
[Speaker 0]:  SA，
[Speaker 0]:  simple，
[Speaker 0]:  callalation will show that this idea is prpractical。
[Speaker 0]:  taking a standard container is an example。
[Speaker 0]:  the shipping cost from major chinese ports such as ninboo，
[Speaker 0]:  porand shanghai poport to sydney brisbane or darwin port is approximately six to seven cents australian dollars per kilogram。
[Speaker 0]:  why is it that the shipping costs is similar，
[Speaker 0]:  even though the sea roote to sydney is thousands of kilometers longer than to darwin？
[Speaker 0]:  this，
[Speaker 0]:  though the shipping cost are not only related ted didibut，
[Speaker 0]:  but also to a series of other factors such as poor charges，
[Speaker 0]:  customoms clearance，
[Speaker 0]:  where housing，
[Speaker 0]:  including port fruit，
[Speaker 0]:  and turn over efficiency for two ports of similar distance。
[Speaker 0]:  if one has a huge fruit receives large ships，
[Speaker 0]:  and the ships are always fully loaded，
[Speaker 0]:  and the poris almost most iddoperpertwenty twenty hours，
[Speaker 0]:  a cowhich。
[Speaker 0]:  the the cost cost from that port will be cheaper。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  the shipping cost from major in port ts along the southeastern coast，
[Speaker 0]:  or often lower than those from darwin porport。
[Speaker 0]:  then after the goods arrive at darwin pod the cheapest way to transport them to sydney or brisbane，
[Speaker 0]:  would be by adding another three thousand kilometers of railway transportation costs，
[Speaker 0]:  which works out to twtwelve fourteen cents australian dollars per kilogram。
[Speaker 0]:  if it's by road transport，
[Speaker 0]:  the costs would increase around twenty eight cents。
[Speaker 0]:  the shipping costs for these two options are three and five times higher，
[Speaker 0]:  respectively，
[Speaker 0]:  then the direct shipping cost from shanghai to sydney。
[Speaker 0]:  now mister president，
[Speaker 0]:  you understand why i said the darwin ports commercial value is actually very low。
[Speaker 0]:  some people might think that ordinary goods are not suitable，
[Speaker 0]:  but could darwin porport handle boke commodities such as minerals and energy，
[Speaker 0]:  australia duproduprodued iron war oil and coal。
[Speaker 0]:  doesn't it？
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  but even considering these darwins location is still very awkward as shown in the map of australia's main mineral distribution。
[Speaker 0]:  have you noticed australia's most valuable mineral iron oore is mainly distributed in the pull barrow region of western australia。
[Speaker 0]:  australia's two largest ports，
[Speaker 0]:  porhehetland and ammper porport are also located in this region。
[Speaker 0]:  secondly，
[Speaker 0]:  coal minds are distributed along the southasterone coast in new south wales in queensland。
[Speaker 0]:  the coal minind here can be transported to newcastle in glass stone，
[Speaker 0]:  ports rank third in six perpectively，
[Speaker 0]:  just a few hundred kilometers to the east。
[Speaker 0]:  similarly，
[Speaker 0]:  there's no need to spend several times to shipping costs to transport goods to darwin，
[Speaker 0]:  thousands of kilometers away。
[Speaker 0]:  and what does darwin port have to offer only small amount of locally produced liquified natural gas from the norern territory？
[Speaker 0]:  this volume is negligible compared to the colossal ports in western australia，
[Speaker 0]:  which handle hundreds of millions of tons of cargo。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  from a purely commercial perspective，
[Speaker 0]:  darwin port is actually very inefficient when we say it's an important port in in northern australiwe're。
[Speaker 0]:  actually referring to its value in military logistics，
[Speaker 0]:  because according to military logic，
[Speaker 0]:  the highest priority is never cost the effectiveness。
[Speaker 0]:  if a conflict breaks out in the south china，
[Speaker 0]:  a in east china sea and the US intervenes quickly deploying fleets and military supplies to the front lines from darwin port could save at least one to two days compared to other ports in the southwest，
[Speaker 0]:  whether it's a large transport aircraft like the sea，
[Speaker 0]:  seventeen or obamer like the b two departing from darwin porport without refueling，
[Speaker 0]:  they can easily cover the first or even the second island chain，
[Speaker 0]:  departing from other ports on the eastern west sides would be much more difficult。
[Speaker 0]:  understanding this，
[Speaker 0]:  when you review the bating motives of the language group back，
[Speaker 0]:  then doesn't it seem quite suspicious？
[Speaker 0]:  looking at the financial statements，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll find it from twenty twelve to twenty fifteen before language group took over。
[Speaker 0]:  darwin ports annual net profit was quite table around less than twenty million australian dollars。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  language es winning bid price in twenty fifteen was five hundred six million australian dollars。
[Speaker 0]:  let me briefly explained it for acid projects like ports and airports。
[Speaker 0]:  the usual valuation method is to use EV enterprise value diknow ded by you biid the earning before before interest texis，
[Speaker 0]:  deticiation and imvertization for the past year。
[Speaker 0]:  you don't need to remember this concept just know that it's a way of calculating profit。
[Speaker 0]:  this multiple basically tells you whether your acquisition pris higher。
[Speaker 0]:  so what was this this llple ple when land dge dge quired it over twenty five times under normal circumstances，
[Speaker 0]:  the valuation of such projects is around eight to twelve times。
[Speaker 0]:  in other words，
[Speaker 0]:  language paid more than twice the fair price。
[Speaker 0]:  how exaggerated is this multiple for comparison in twenty pertwenty times after leacauhing hutch's imports company was selling its global poort assets，
[Speaker 0]:  the multiple offered was looteen times。
[Speaker 0]:  this already noting that many count the acquisition price offered worwornonoted many chchinese media outlets incluonly official CCP mediclaimed ed。
[Speaker 0]:  the forof ddarwin was losing money before language to over and only became profitable after language suppporquisition。
[Speaker 0]:  they also claimed that the australian government was being unfair in trying to read benefits for lanverage now and so on。
[Speaker 0]:  this statement is actually untrue。
[Speaker 0]:  the reality is that the port of darwin was already profitable before language took over。
[Speaker 0]:  this rhetoric is merely intended to create public pressure and increase their bargaining power。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  looking back at the twenty fifteen bidding process，
[Speaker 0]:  only two scenarios can explain languages behavior。
[Speaker 0]:  first languages management was foolish。
[Speaker 0]:  second，
[Speaker 0]:  they had terior motives and more interested in much more than just commercial profits。
[Speaker 0]:  some might wonder since the chinese companies intended tions in that acquisition were so obvious。
[Speaker 0]:  how did it pass smoothly in the first place was the australian government stupid here。
[Speaker 0]:  we have to mention a fatal blind spot in australian politics at the time，
[Speaker 0]:  and the almost naive strategic misjudgment of the CC reregime the world at large。
[Speaker 0]:  first，
[Speaker 0]:  we need to understand australia's unique political structure in australia，
[Speaker 0]:  state and territory。
[Speaker 0]:  governments have considerable autonomy，
[Speaker 0]:  not only fifteen。
[Speaker 0]:  the northern territory government was extremely poor，
[Speaker 0]:  not only burden with huge debt，
[Speaker 0]:  but also facing a severe funding gap for urgently needed upgrades to the port of barwin。
[Speaker 0]:  there。
[Speaker 0]:  thinking at the time was since the federal government woulproviprovide undundthey would sell assets。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  there was a huge policy loople in federal regulations at the time according to the law，
[Speaker 0]:  then if an asset was sold directly to foreign investors by stator territory government，
[Speaker 0]:  the feal al had had no right to intervene，
[Speaker 0]:  as long as it didn't involve core national security areas。
[Speaker 0]:  although the port of darwin was close to three military basis，
[Speaker 0]:  it was technically a civilian port and did not belong to three department of defence。
[Speaker 0]:  furthermore，
[Speaker 0]:  australian politics at the time was still basking in the africa of the golden decade of sigal australian relations，
[Speaker 0]:  and the CCP was still hearing to denin shopping in johs them in policicof of hiding scapabilities and biiting。
[Speaker 0]:  its time not fully revealing its true intentions。
[Speaker 0]:  most stern countries，
[Speaker 0]:  including australia，
[Speaker 0]:  still only considered a business partner and completely failed to anticipated subsequent comprehenve notification。
[Speaker 0]:  this gave the language group a perfect window of of opportunity。
[Speaker 0]:  in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  the party state is leveraging control over ports from hbbanota in three lunge to parrae。
[Speaker 0]:  in greece and then to darwin port。
[Speaker 0]:  the methods are identical first exexloloiting oppoles in western countries，
[Speaker 0]:  policies from local government's finances。
[Speaker 0]:  they sign nineteen nine year leases at exororbin prices。
[Speaker 0]:  you might think a big full is coming，
[Speaker 0]:  but little do know they are strategically planning minds in your backyard。
[Speaker 0]:  this includes the fourth transfer of keyports from lecaashing to chinese styed on enterprises last year，
[Speaker 0]:  which was a concrete example of this scheme，
[Speaker 0]:  although it didn't fully succeed the subsequent changes in the situation over the next few years，
[Speaker 0]:  completely awaken ened australians was with a changing times chinese diplatic style shift ted，
[Speaker 0]:  an aggressive wololwar，
[Speaker 0]:  a mode miltarization of south china sea and the outbreak of the final US trayward。
[Speaker 0]:  the australian government suddenly realized that the chinese neighbor who had been operating in their backyard for nearly ten years，
[Speaker 0]:  had actually installed a camera in their bedroom。
[Speaker 0]:  it can be said that this twenty fifteen transaction was an expensive lesson learned by australian sovereigty and security for its political naivity。
[Speaker 0]:  the australian government's current response is essentially ability attempt to address the security black hole left by that geopolitical immaturity。
[Speaker 0]:  now let's talk about the third point one，
[Speaker 0]:  some argugue，
[Speaker 0]:  while lldley's might indebe helping the CCP with s sponoage，
[Speaker 0]:  there is still no conclusive evidence。
[Speaker 0]:  how can the australian government unilaterally convicicsomeone and terminate the contract without concrete evidence？
[Speaker 0]:  what about judicial independence and the spirit of contract？
[Speaker 0]:  this needs to be discussed in two parts，
[Speaker 0]:  starting with the contract。
[Speaker 0]:  first，
[Speaker 0]:  let's correct a misconception。
[Speaker 0]:  many believe that any contract violation means a lack of adhearance to the contract。
[Speaker 0]:  this is wrong because breach of contract is itself part of the exit mechanism of a commercial contract。
[Speaker 0]:  for example，
[Speaker 0]:  you open a restaurant in sign a ten year lease，
[Speaker 0]:  but the restaurant goes bankrupt in the first year，
[Speaker 0]:  and you have to terminate the lease。
[Speaker 0]:  can the landlord say you can't terminate the lease and must run for ten years。
[Speaker 0]:  otherwise，
[Speaker 0]:  you lack the spirit of contract。
[Speaker 0]:  obviously，
[Speaker 0]:  none，
[Speaker 0]:  because the contract definitely includes an early termination clause。
[Speaker 0]:  you just have to pay compensation only if you terminate the least and refuse to pay the liquidity damages。
[Speaker 0]:  can you be considered to lack the spirit of contract？
[Speaker 0]:  imagine the lee o arriving in darwin，
[Speaker 0]:  australia。
[Speaker 0]:  it's like a landlord renting to attenant only defined out half way through the least that detenant is a ief and a covert，
[Speaker 0]:  installing hidden cameras and listening devices in the house in this situation。
[Speaker 0]:  would you still insist on waiting until the end of the least to take action，
[Speaker 0]:  especially if it's a long term lease，
[Speaker 0]:  you would definitely rather break the lease early and get rid of them。
[Speaker 0]:  you would the safety of your family is paramount。
[Speaker 0]:  secondly，
[Speaker 0]:  there's the issue conconiciction。
[Speaker 0]:  we know know that a typical judicial context。
[Speaker 0]:  the principle is that a person is ininnocent told proven guilty。
[Speaker 0]:  ty can't lock someone up just because you suspect they committed murder。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  national security assessments are not typical situations。
[Speaker 0]:  they follow a preventative logic，
[Speaker 0]:  not post event。
[Speaker 0]:  accountability。
[Speaker 0]:  simply put，
[Speaker 0]:  i don't need to prove what bluebridge explicitly did as long as their existence poses a significant risk of causing a exasurable damage and warar time，
[Speaker 0]:  then the threat must be eliminated。
[Speaker 0]:  now some might think this is too arbitrary。
[Speaker 0]:  normally，
[Speaker 0]:  courts require evidence in procedure。
[Speaker 0]:  when trying cases，
[Speaker 0]:  why is national security example from these rules？
[Speaker 0]:  if you think that way，
[Speaker 0]:  let me ask you a question under the legal systems of china，
[Speaker 0]:  the united states or any normal country，
[Speaker 0]:  you can't commit murder，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  if you commit murder，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll go to jail，
[Speaker 0]:  even be executed，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so why is it that in a battlefield situation？
[Speaker 0]:  killing is not only unpunished，
[Speaker 0]:  but even celebrated as heroism。
[Speaker 0]:  because in peace time，
[Speaker 0]:  the judicial system is designed around the goal of achieving justice，
[Speaker 0]:  but in wartime，
[Speaker 0]:  including the logic of national security，
[Speaker 0]:  the primary goal is to ensure survival。
[Speaker 0]:  what does that mean？
[Speaker 0]:  let me give you an easy to understand example，
[Speaker 0]:  suppose you encounter a theft case involving one thousand dollars。
[Speaker 0]:  there's a suspect who is very likely the thief，
[Speaker 0]:  but there's insufficient evidence。
[Speaker 0]:  in this case，
[Speaker 0]:  you can't use the presumption of guilt because you might wrongly convict in innocent person。
[Speaker 0]:  so we'd rather risk losing one thousand dollars and letting a criminal go free，
[Speaker 0]:  you can afford that risk。
[Speaker 0]:  but what if the stolen item was a superpowerful nuclear bomb capable of destroying the entire country and the thief intends to sell it to a terrorist organization？
[Speaker 0]:  would you still say that to avoid wrongly convicting an innocent person，
[Speaker 0]:  you let them go or even refuse to search their basement out of respect for their privacy？
[Speaker 0]:  they certait ly wouldn't there？
[Speaker 0]:  because if it really was their fault，
[Speaker 0]:  no one could bear the potential consequences。
[Speaker 0]:  this is the logic of national security。
[Speaker 0]:  to what extent can this national security logic go to the point that i don't need to disclose exactly what financial control methods were used against language as in ordeninly judal。
[Speaker 0]:  if i say it is，
[Speaker 0]:  then it is if i say there there re's a risk，
[Speaker 0]:  then there's a risk。
[Speaker 0]:  because if the australian government publicly revealed in court，
[Speaker 0]:  how we monitor the back door in the language system，
[Speaker 0]:  it would be tent amount to directly telling our opponents when my monitoring methods or and where my intelligence sources come from，
[Speaker 0]:  many people think that a country of contracts refers to peace time and is not include exceptional circumstances because the right to national survival and the existence of the constitution or prerequiisits for the fulffilment of all commercial contracts。
[Speaker 0]:  at this point，
[Speaker 0]:  some people might say，
[Speaker 0]:  isn't the CCP also using the pretext of national security to engage in red terrotactics in china are trailly ly resting for alleged crimes are confiscating perpersonal assets。
[Speaker 0]:  but if your australian government is the same thing，
[Speaker 0]:  what's the difference between you in china？
[Speaker 0]:  there is a difference and a very big one。
[Speaker 0]:  first。
[Speaker 0]:  the scope of the definition of security is different。
[Speaker 0]:  the national security in the CCP 's reheoric is a broad category。
[Speaker 0]:  anything from posting a webo message to withdrawing money from a bank can be included。
[Speaker 0]:  their logic，
[Speaker 0]:  is that anything that might be detrimental to the party's rule or absoluthority can be considered a national security issue。
[Speaker 0]:  this kind of logic is inwardly focused used against its own people。
[Speaker 0]:  it's not national security，
[Speaker 0]:  but rather regime security。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  the national security review in countries like the US in australia is ouwardly focused it target specific for in political forces with which they have a competitive relationship。
[Speaker 0]:  you may find that the australian government might cease darwin port，
[Speaker 0]:  but it wwon't confiscate the warehouse or home of any ordinary chinese businessman on the streets of sydney and boundaries are very strstrict fic，
[Speaker 0]:  a spacts critical infrastructure instrategic nodes。
[Speaker 0]:  secondly，
[Speaker 0]:  who supervise susupervisers in china，
[Speaker 0]:  the government says you 're a spy。
[Speaker 0]:  you can even find a lawyer，
[Speaker 0]:  even even lawyer might become a spy。
[Speaker 0]:  but in australia，
[Speaker 0]:  this form of national seficity still still has to withstand scrutiny from the entire judicial system。
[Speaker 0]:  the australian government cannot simply seize the port by issuing a red document。
[Speaker 0]:  the opposition party will be watching to see if you engaging in political pportunism。
[Speaker 0]:  and the media will be scrutiiing you with the magnifying glass to see if you engage in illegal operations or excessive enforcement。
[Speaker 0]:  most importantly，
[Speaker 0]:  the independent judicial system is ffunctioning，
[Speaker 0]:  and the bluebridge group can still sue the australian government in federal court and is highly likely to receive compensation。
[Speaker 0]:  of course，
[Speaker 0]:  having said that，
[Speaker 0]:  i must admit that any country，
[Speaker 0]:  including established democracies like australia，
[Speaker 0]:  may face the risk of the government abusing its power under the pretext of national security。
[Speaker 0]:  this is especially true with the continued international geopolitical tensions and the increasing risk of war。
[Speaker 0]:  but this is a systemic tension that we must enr at the end of this program。
[Speaker 0]:  i want to say that from darwin port to panama，
[Speaker 0]:  everything reminds us of a cold hard reality。
[Speaker 0]:  the human world is a whole is transitioning from a peaceful era based on estaclish rules to a prewar state where rules still exist，
[Speaker 0]:  but priorities need to be establish。
[Speaker 0]:  some of the CCP 's actions will face increasing scrutiny judgment and even in circlement。
[Speaker 0]:  in the future。
[Speaker 0]:  this trend cannot be changed by what some people called trumps actions，
[Speaker 0]:  the angered western allies and aided shejumping。
[Speaker 0]:  simply put，
[Speaker 0]:  whether it's europe，
[Speaker 0]:  canada or australia。
[Speaker 0]:  they may superficially disagree with trump。
[Speaker 0]:  but when it comes to national security，
[Speaker 0]:  they all know who the real enemy is that needs to be guarded against。
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  that's offer today's program。
[Speaker 0]:  if you have any questions，
[Speaker 0]:  please leave me a message or send me an email see you next time。
