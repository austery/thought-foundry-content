Welcome
 everyone
 to
 the
 first
 edition


for
 2026
 of
 the
 OnPy
 podcast.
 I'm
 Steve


Pac
 and
 I'm
 John
 Michael
 McGrath.


>> Today
 on
 the
 pod,
 well,
 Ontario
 Place
 is


back
 in
 the
 news.
 The
 Supreme
 Court
 of


Canada
 is
 going
 to
 hear
 arguments
 about


whether
 it's
 a
 good
 idea
 to
 put
 a
 spa
 on


Toronto's
 waterfront.
 It's
 been
 a
 rough


flu
 season,
 but
 there
 might
 be
 some
 good


news
 for
 Ontario's
 healthcare
 system.


New
 numbers
 suggest
 fewer
 people
 might


need
 a
 family
 doctor
 than
 we
 previously


thought.


>> How
 would
 you
 feel
 if
 your
 boss
 ordered


you
 back
 into
 the
 office?
 5
 days
 a
 week,


but
 the
 boss
 was
 enjoying
 one
 of the


longest
 work
 away
 from
 the
 office
 stints


ever.
 Yeah,
 that's
 what
 we
 thought.


>> And
 in
 your
 column,
 my
 column,
 I
 will


ask
 when
 exactly
 the
 Ontario
 Liberal


Party
 is
 going
 to
 get
 around
 to
 picking


a
 new
 leader.


>> And
 speaking
 of
 Liberal
 leaders,
 I'm


focused
 on
 one
 of
 the
 true
 lions
 of
 the


legislature,
 97year-old
 former
 Ontario


Liberal
 Leader
 Robert
 Nixon,
 who
 got


elected
 for
 the
 first
 time
 64
 years
 ago


this
 weekend.
 and
 we've
 got
 some
 funny


stories
 from
 the
 Hustings
 from
 that
 one.


It's
 Friday,
 January
 16th,
 2026.
 So,


let's
 get
 to
 it.


>> JMM,
 first
 sugar
 of
 2026.
 There
 we
 go.


>> Back
 at
 it.


>> Now,
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 snow
 out


there.


>> And
 I
 must
 say,
 all
 day
 long,
 I
 have


been
 wondering
 to
 myself,
 I
 wonder
 if


he's
 going
 to
 cycle
 in
 today.


>> You
 did
 not
 cycle,
 did
 you?


>> I
 did
 not.
 No.
 And
 like
 every
 point
 on


my
 way
 into
 the
 office
 as
 I
 met
 one
 of


our
 colleagues
 in
 the
 halls,
 they
 were


like,
 "You
 didn't
 bike
 into
 work
 today."


No,
 no,
 my
 instinct
 for


self-preservation
 is
 stronger
 than
 my
 uh


moral
 pining
 about
 riding
 a
 bike
 in
 the


winter.


>> But
 it's
 nice
 to
 know
 that
 your
 brand


has
 definitely
 stuck
 in
 people's
 minds.


That's
 the
 first
 thing
 everybody
 thinks


of
 when
 they
 see
 you.


>> Yes.
 Well,
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 do
 enjoy


Well,
 I
 don't
 enjoy
 I
 I
 I
 enjoy
 the
 idea


of
 being
 somebody
 who
 bikes
 in
 the


winter.
 Uh,
 but
 I
 also
 uh
 this
 week's


weather
 has
 been
 too
 much
 even
 for
 me.


>> I
 think
 so.
 I
 think
 so.
 Now,
 what


exactly?
 You've
 got
 a
 bucktoothoth


glasseswearing


uh
 cheese
 head
 or
 something.
 Oh,
 emoji.


Okay.
 Yeah.
 What
 exactly
 is
 that?


>> This
 uh
 was
 a
 gift
 from
 uh
 my
 kid
 for


Christmas.
 Uh
 who
 uh
 my
 kid
 as
 much
 as


anybody
 else
 uh
 knows
 that
 I
 wear
 funny


t-shirts
 on
 the
 podcast.
 And
 uh
 they


decided
 uh
 that
 they
 wanted
 to
 help
 out


with
 the
 the
 the
 wardrobe
 selection.
 So


yes,
 we
 have
 a
 a
 nerdyl
 looking
 emoji
 uh


saying
 um
 actually
 uh
 which
 is
 I
 I
 think


depressingly
 on
 brand.


>> Did
 you
 do
 that?


>> Well,
 in
 terms
 of
 you
 know
 like
 what


kind
 of
 journalism
 do
 we
 do
 here?
 Well,


I
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 explaining
 things,
 right?


>> You
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 actually
 uh
 no
 here's


what's
 really
 going
 on.
 Uh,
 so
 yes,
 uh,


both
 a
 a
 a
 valued
 contribution
 to
 the


podcast
 wardrobe
 and
 also
 I
 think
 my


10-year-old
 is
 making
 fun
 of
 me
 just
 a


little,
 but
 uh,
 yeah,
 that
 was
 coming


anyway.


>> Okay.


>> And
 how
 about
 you,
 Steve?


>> Well,
 um,
 just
 as
 you
 like
 to
 wear
 kind


of
 funny,
 cute,
 odd,
 science
 fictiony


sometimes
 t-shirts.
 Uh,
 my
 thing
 here
 is


to
 usually
 wear
 a
 t-shirt
 with
 a
 premier


of
 Ontario
 on
 it.
 And
 I
 have
 chosen,
 let


me
 stand
 up
 here.


>> Okay,
 there's
 John
 P.
 Robarts,
 who
 was


premier
 of
 Ontario
 in
 the
 1960s,
 which


coincidentally
 was
 probably
 Ontario's


best
 ever
 decade.
 And
 why
 am
 I
 wearing


Roarts
 today?
 Because
 109
 years
 ago,


last
 weekend,
 he
 was
 born.
 January
 the


11th,


1917.
 109
 years
 ago.
 And
 there's


something
 really
 kind
 of
 coincidentally


weird
 about
 Mr.
 Roberts's
 birthday.
 He


shares
 a
 birthday
 with
 Sir
 Johnny


Macdonald
 who
 was
 also
 the
 11th
 of


January
 and
 Jean
 Cretam


>> who
 turned
 92
 on
 the
 11th
 of
 January.
 So


parents
 out
 there
 I
 am
 telling
 you
 right


now
 if
 you
 want
 your
 child
 to
 become
 a


first
 minister
 make
 sure
 they
 are
 born


on
 the
 11th
 of
 January
 and
 they
 have


John
 in
 English
 or
 in
 French
 as
 their


first
 name.
 That
 appears
 to
 be
 the


trick.


>> I
 missed
 that
 one
 unfortunately.
 I
 mean


February
 baby.


>> Oh
 there
 you
 go.
 There
 you
 go.
 Can
 we


put
 this
 picture
 up
 Sheldon?
 First
 of


all,
 this
 is
 Mr.
 Roberts
 at
 a


progressive
 conservative
 meeting.
 And


I'll
 tell
 you
 what,
 he
 won
 his


leadership
 in
 1961
 to
 become
 leader
 of


the
 PC
 party
 and
 thus
 Ontario's
 17th


prime
 minister,
 as
 the
 term
 was
 called


back
 then.
 Wasn't
 premier,
 it
 was
 prime


minister.
 Uh
 he
 won
 on
 six
 ballots
 at


Varsity
 Arena.
 It
 was
 one
 of the
 great


all-time
 leadership
 conventions.
 And


funnily
 enough,
 he
 won
 over
 a
 fellow


cabinet
 minister
 from
 Lesie
 Frost


Cabinet
 whose
 name
 was
 Kelso
 Roberts.


So,
 you
 had
 Robert's
 versus
 Roberts.
 One


letter
 different.
 Boy,


>> one
 vowel.


>> One
 vowel
 different.
 You
 got
 to
 be


careful
 when
 you
 mark
 your
 ballot
 for


that
 one.
 Uh,
 as
 I
 said
 earlier,
 a
 great


time
 to
 be
 premier
 of
 Ontario.
 No


deficits,
 right?
 They
 balanced
 budgets


all
 the
 time.
 They
 created
 the
 first


nuclear
 power
 plants
 in
 Ontario
 at


Pickering
 under
 the
 Roart's
 years.
 Go


Transit
 came
 in
 under
 the
 Roart's
 years.


He
 established
 what
 was
 called
 the


Confederation
 of
 Tomorrow
 conference
 on


the
 top
 floor
 of
 the
 newly
 built
 TD


center.
 This
 was
 in
 1967
 because
 bombs


were
 blowing
 up
 in
 mailboxes
 in
 Quebec


and
 he
 wanted
 to
 try
 to
 understand


better
 what
 is
 it
 that
 Quebec
 wants.
 So


he
 got
 all
 the
 premers
 together
 at
 the


top
 of
 the
 TD
 and
 had
 the
 first
 and
 most


important
 first
 ministers
 conference


since
 Charlotttown
 in
 1864.


His
 minister
 of
 education
 was
 John


Michael.


>> Uh
 I
 would
 be
 fired
 if
 I
 did
 not
 know


this
 one.
 Uh
 Bill
 Davis.


>> Well,
 you'd
 certainly
 not
 be
 my
 friend


anymore.
 Yes.
 Uh
 30
 I
 think
 he
 was
 33


when
 he
 got
 the
 job.
 33-year-old
 Bill


Davis
 uh
 who
 was
 Minister
 of
 Education


for
 almost
 nine
 years.
 And
 they
 were


again
 some
 of
 the
 best
 years
 we
 ever
 had


when
 it
 came
 to
 education
 in
 Ontario.


The
 creation
 of
 the
 entire
 college


system
 in
 the
 Roart's
 years.
 The


creation
 of
 OY,
 the
 Ontario
 Institute


for
 Studies
 and
 Education.


>> The
 creation
 of
 there
 was
 one
 more.
 One


more.
 What
 was
 the
 Oh
 yeah,
 TVO.


>> TVO
 also
 created
 uh
 in
 the
 Robart's


years.
 And
 for
 those
 who
 want
 to
 I
 don't


know.
 I'm
 one
 of
 these
 kind
 of
 people


who
 likes
 to
 do
 this.
 Sheldon,
 next


picture
 if
 you
 would.
 Mr.
 Robert's
 final


resting
 place
 is
 in
 the
 cemetery
 uh
 in


downtown
 Toronto
 at
 the
 corner
 of


Parliament
 and
 Blure.
 And
 as
 he
 is
 a


former
 premier
 of
 Ontario,
 there's
 one


of
 these
 official
 looking
 plaques
 that


you
 get
 beside
 your
 graveside.
 But
 what


I
 find
 fascinating
 about
 his
 headstone,


you
 can
 see
 a
 couple
 of
 trilliums,
 which


makes
 sense
 for
 a
 former
 premier
 of


Ontario,
 but
 it's
 very
 understated.
 And


you
 see
 the
 title,
 Prime
 Minister
 of


Ontario
 there.
 Very
 understated.
 It's


not
 one
 of
 these
 big,
 you
 know,
 ego
 trip


things.
 Uh,
 that
 was
 not
 his
 style.
 And,


you
 know,
 why
 do
 I
 like
 and
 care
 about


and
 frankly
 know
 so
 much
 about
 John


Roberts?
 Next
 picture,
 Sheldon,
 if
 you


would.
 Yes,
 I
 wrote
 a
 book
 about
 him.


So,
 this
 is
 going
 back
 about,
 I
 don't


know,
 15
 or
 20
 years.
 And
 I
 wrote
 a
 book


called
 Public
 Triumph,
 Private
 Tragedy,


The
 Double
 Life
 of
 John
 Roberts.
 And
 the


double
 life
 refers
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 he


had
 a
 truly
 splendid


premiership.
 I
 mean,
 one
 of
 the
 best
 of


all
 time.
 And
 his
 life
 ended
 in
 suicide.


He
 had
 a
 stroke
 when
 he
 was
 65
 after
 he


was
 out
 of
 office.
 And
 he
 just
 decided,


I
 don't
 want
 to
 live
 life
 like
 this.
 I
 I


I
 need
 more
 out
 of
 life.
 And
 therefore


was
 lost
 to
 suicide.
 It
 really
 caused


him
 a
 great
 deal
 of
 depression.
 So,
 a


double
 life
 in
 some
 respects.
 Anyway,


that's
 why
 I
 got
 Robarts
 on
 today.


>> Uh,
 if
 I
 can
 uh
 live
 up
 to
 my
 new


t-shirt,
 I
 do
 have
 to
 make
 one
 small


correction.
 You
 referred
 to
 the
 first


nuclear
 power
 plants
 at
 Pickering.
 Uh


Ontario's
 first
 nuclear
 power
 plant
 was


at
 Douglas
 Point,
 close
 to
 where
 the
 the


Bruce
 Generating
 Station
 is
 today.


>> Is
 that
 a
 fact?


>> Wow.
 Okay.
 So,
 the
 first
 what
 what
 shall


we
 call
 it?
 Multi-reactor.


>> Yes.


>> Um
 situation.


>> Yeah.
 Picking
 I
 was
 was
 followed
 on
 a


few
 years
 later
 and
 is
 is
 a
 more


substantial
 complex
 I
 believe.
 Um
 and


then
 later
 they
 would
 build
 the
 much


larger
 scale
 Bruce
 uh
 generating


station.


>> Sheldon,
 meet
 me
 on
 camera.
 Meet
 me
 on


this
 camera.
 Folks,
 this
 is
 why
 you
 need


to
 listen
 to
 or
 watch
 this
 podcast


because
 um
 actually
 McGrath
 is
 usually


right
 about
 all
 this
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 And


with
 that,
 now
 you
 can
 meet
 me
 back
 over


here
 on
 the
 main
 camera.
 Off
 to
 issue


one.


Last
 Friday,
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 of
 Canada


made
 one
 of
 its
 regular
 announcements


about
 which
 appeals
 it
 has
 decided
 to


hear
 and
 which
 ones
 it
 won't.
 Why
 is


that
 news?
 because
 this
 time
 the


country's
 highest
 court
 has
 decided
 it


will
 hear
 from
 critics
 of
 the
 provincial


government
 who
 are
 trying
 to
 stop
 Doug


Ford's
 plans
 for
 Ontario
 Place.
 Are
 you


surprised
 to
 hear
 that
 the
 court
 is


taking
 this
 up?


>> I
 I
 really
 was.
 I
 did
 not
 think
 that
 the


court
 would
 uh
 hear
 this
 case.
 Uh
 I'm


going
 to
 take
 a
 pundit
 humility
 moment


here
 and
 say
 that
 I
 was
 wrong.


>> You're
 going
 to
 give
 yourself
 an
 uh


actually


>> um
 but
 I
 I'm
 hoping
 that
 it
 turns
 out


that
 I
 was
 wrong
 in
 an
 interesting
 way.


Um,
 why
 did
 I
 think
 that
 the
 court
 would


not
 hear
 this
 appeal?
 Well,
 the
 short


version
 is
 that
 there
 wasn't
 much


disagreement
 between
 the
 trial
 court
 and


the
 Ontario
 Court
 of
 Appeals.
 Uh,
 this


first
 went
 to
 trial
 in
 2024.
 Uh,


Ontario's
 highest
 court
 heard
 the
 appeal


last
 year
 in
 2025.
 Neither
 decision
 was


a
 huge
 departure
 from
 uh
 the
 the


existing
 precedents.
 So,
 I
 didn't
 think


that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 for
 the
 Supreme


Court
 uh
 to
 say.
 And
 you
 know,
 the


Supreme
 Court
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 demands
 on


its
 time.
 and
 it
 has
 to
 manage
 its
 own


case
 load.
 So,
 I
 thought
 they
 would


leave
 this
 one
 alone.


>> Now,
 we're
 going
 to
 dig
 into
 this
 one
 a


little
 bit
 more
 here
 because
 the


government's
 critics
 want
 to
 stop
 the


province
 from
 redeveloping
 Ontario
 Place


along
 the
 lines
 that
 we
 have
 talked


about
 before
 on
 this
 show,
 including
 the


Therma
 Spa,
 which
 has
 received
 so
 much


attention.
 So,
 again,
 if
 you
 know,
 not


everybody
 follows
 all
 of
 these
 nuances


in
 and
 out,
 what's
 the
 case
 they
 want
 to


make?
 So
 the
 uh
 community
 group
 in


question,
 Ontario
 Place
 Protectors,
 they


have
 made
 two
 main
 arguments
 in
 court
 so


far.
 Uh
 first,
 they
 argue
 that
 the
 law


that
 the
 legislature
 passed
 in
 2023
 to


speed
 the
 redevelopment
 of
 Ontario
 Place


violates
 the
 constitution
 by


functionally
 eliminating
 most


opportunities
 for
 the
 public
 to


challenge
 it
 in
 court.
 Basically,
 the


law
 says
 you
 uh
 cannot
 bring
 certain


types
 of
 uh
 legal
 actions
 to
 court
 about


uh
 this
 uh
 redevelopment
 plan.
 You
 know,


in
 our
 constitution,
 the
 provinces
 uh


administer
 uh
 all
 of
 the
 important


provincial
 courts,
 even
 cases
 where
 it's


actually
 the
 federal
 government
 that


names
 uh
 judges
 to
 uh
 important
 courts.


So,
 but
 that
 administrative
 power
 uh


includes
 a
 a
 broad
 authority
 to


determine
 what
 matters
 can
 be
 heard
 by
 a


court,
 uh
 which
 courts
 can
 hear
 them,


whether
 they
 can
 be
 heard
 by
 a
 court
 at


all.
 Uh
 so,
 and
 and
 that
 is
 what
 the


Ford
 government
 did
 in
 Ontario
 Place.


They
 just
 said
 this
 is
 not
 a
 matter
 that


uh
 we
 we
 are
 giving
 the
 courts
 a
 huge


amount
 of
 uh
 input
 into.
 Um
 they
 did


still
 allow
 for
 uh
 overall
 judicial


review
 of
 uh
 the
 the
 the
 law,
 but
 uh


yeah,
 there's
 no
 argument
 that
 they


substantially
 limited
 the
 uh
 avenues


available
 to
 uh
 the
 public.
 Um
 the


second
 argument
 that
 uh
 Ontario
 Place


protectors
 made
 is
 that
 the
 site
 of


Ontario
 Place
 which
 is
 like
 a
 heritage


site
 uh
 they
 argued
 that
 it's
 a
 kind
 of


a
 public
 trust
 and
 that
 the
 Ontario


government
 should
 be
 seen
 as
 having


violated
 that
 public
 trust
 with
 its
 uh


redevelopment
 plans.
 I
 should
 probably


also
 add
 very
 quickly
 because
 I
 got
 this


question
 a
 lot
 uh
 when
 the
 the
 Supreme


Court's
 announcement
 was
 first
 made.
 Uh


nothing
 in
 the
 argument
 so
 far
 is
 a


Charter
 of
 Rights
 and
 Freedoms
 case.
 Uh


so
 the
 notwithstanding
 clause
 is
 not


really
 relevant
 here
 whatever
 the


Supreme
 Court
 would
 eventually
 decide.


>> Can
 I
 do
 a
 little
 um
 actually


>> sure


>> which
 premier
 decided
 to
 build
 Ontario


Place?


>> I
 mean
 was
 it
 Robarts?


>> It
 was
 indeed.
 Very
 good.
 Good
 for
 you.


>> Because
 it
 was
 a
 like
 a
 centennial


thing.
 It
 was
 1967,
 right?


>> Well,
 it
 didn't.
 He
 actually
 made
 the


decision
 in
 the
 late
 1960s
 because
 he


thought,
 you
 know,
 kids
 who
 are
 not


lucky
 enough
 to
 be
 able
 to
 go
 away
 to


summer
 camp
 need
 something
 to
 do
 in
 the


summertime.
 So,
 he
 wanted
 to
 build
 an


amusement
 park
 for
 kids
 uh
 on
 the


waterfront
 in
 Toronto
 that
 they
 could
 go


to.
 And
 of
 course,
 it
 was
 wildly
 popular


for
 a
 while.
 By
 the
 time
 it
 was
 ready
 to


open,
 it
 was
 actually
 1971
 and
 I
 think


Bill
 Davis
 opened
 it
 because
 uh
 you


know,
 he
 succeeded
 Mr.
 Robarts.


>> But
 it
 was
 John
 Roberts
 who
 made
 the


decision
 to
 make
 this
 happen.


>> Now,
 the
 arguments
 that
 you've
 just


summed
 up,
 Yes.
 have
 been
 advanced
 twice


already
 at
 previous
 courts
 and
 I
 mean


rejected
 twice
 by
 previous
 courts.
 It
 it


did
 not
 go
 well
 for
 uh
 the
 Ontario
 Place


protectors.
 As
 I
 say,
 at
 both
 the
 trial


and
 uh
 appeal
 courts,
 those
 arguments


were
 pretty
 thoroughly
 rejected.
 The


court
 said
 that
 while
 it's
 possible
 to


imagine
 a
 situation
 in
 which
 a


government
 so
 limited
 the
 court's


jurisdiction
 that
 that
 that
 would
 in


fact
 breach
 the
 constitution.
 They
 did


not
 think
 that
 is
 the
 case
 here.
 From


the
 point
 of
 view
 of
 the
 courts,
 this
 is


a
 pretty
 straightforward
 case
 of
 the


legislature
 making
 policy
 within
 its
 own


jurisdiction.
 Ontario
 owns
 the
 land.
 It


makes
 local
 and
 municipal
 policy.
 These


are
 all
 really
 clearly
 spelled
 out
 in


the
 constitution
 as
 as
 the
 province's


powers.
 So
 this
 is
 just
 entirely
 within


the
 normal
 jurisdiction
 of
 the
 province.


And
 they
 also
 said
 on
 the
 the
 public


trust
 issue,
 there's
 really
 no
 precedent


to
 apply
 a
 public
 trust
 framework
 to


Canadian
 governments
 and
 they
 did
 not


think
 this
 was
 the
 right
 time
 to
 start.


>> Well,
 at
 the
 risk
 of
 asking
 a
 dumb


question,
 if
 it's
 so
 cut
 and
 dried,
 why


is
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 agreeing
 to
 hear


this
 case
 again?


>> Oh,
 well,
 uh,
 I
 wrote
 about
 this
 for
 TVO


this
 uh,
 yes,
 this
 week.
 Um,
 and
 I
 will


just
 remind
 everyone
 listening
 that
 I


have
 already
 been
 wrong
 once
 about
 this


case.
 So,
 take
 the
 following
 for
 what


it's
 worth.
 But
 sometimes
 the
 Supreme


Court
 does
 agree
 to
 hear
 a
 case
 not


because
 there
 is
 uh
 like
 a
 strong


consensus
 among
 the
 justices
 that
 the


lower
 courts
 goofed
 and
 need
 to
 be


reversed.
 Uh,
 but
 because
 some
 of
 the


justices
 see
 an
 important
 uh
 public


issue
 where
 the
 court
 can
 update
 its


guidance
 or
 or
 clarify
 some
 precedent.


Right.
 And
 this
 key
 issue
 in
 the
 Ontario


Place
 case
 is
 important
 on
 its
 own,


right?
 Like
 how
 how
 much
 can
 governments


limit
 the
 jurisdiction
 of
 courts?
 That's


already,
 I
 would
 say,
 an
 important


question
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 get
 more


important
 as
 we
 go
 forward
 with
 laws


like
 uh
 Bill
 Five
 in
 Ontario
 and
 uh
 to
 a


lesser
 extent
 bill
 C5
 federally,
 which


are
 these
 laws
 designed
 to
 uh
 streamline


uh
 major
 sort
 of
 resource
 and
 industrial


projects.
 um
 you
 know
 the
 the
 Ontario


government's
 bill
 five
 that
 created


these
 um
 special
 economic
 zones
 that
 we


referred
 to
 on
 the
 podcast
 before
 that


are
 designed
 to
 you
 know
 accelerate


mining
 uh
 projects
 for
 example
 the


government
 used
 almost
 verbatim
 the


exact
 same
 language
 in
 that
 special


economic
 zones
 bill
 that
 it
 used
 in
 the


Ontario
 place
 bill.
 So
 the
 court
 uh
 may


just
 uh
 be
 looking
 to
 uh
 clarify
 this


question
 of
 you
 know
 how
 much
 can
 you


circumscribe
 the
 uh
 power
 of
 provincial


courts
 uh
 before
 you
 breach
 the


constitution.
 Once
 again
 very
 clearly
 I


do
 not
 know
 the
 future.
 Um
 but
 I
 think


that's
 a
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 um
 a
 realistic
 uh


outcome.
 I
 I
 don't
 expect
 that
 the


Supreme
 Court
 is
 going
 to
 uh
 step
 in
 to


save
 Ontario
 Place
 at
 the
 last
 minute.


>> You
 want
 to
 put
 a
 friendly
 wager
 on


that?


>> I
 do
 not.
 I
 I've
 already
 been
 wrong
 and


I
 don't
 want
 to
 lose
 money.


>> In
 which
 case,
 off
 to
 issue
 two.


One
 of
 the
 most
 persistent
 problems
 for


the
 Ontario
 government
 has
 been
 health


care
 and
 in
 particular
 the
 shortage
 of


family
 doctors
 in
 the
 province.
 Late


last
 year,
 the
 Auditor
 General
 reported


that
 2
 million
 Ontarians
 did
 not
 have


access
 to
 a
 primary
 care
 provider.
 For


its
 part,
 the
 government
 says,
 "Hold
 the


fort.
 There
 is
 some
 good
 news
 here
 to


start
 the
 year."
 What's
 the
 government


referring
 to
 here?


>> This
 is
 one
 of
 those
 cases
 where
 the


words
 relative
 good
 news
 really
 need
 to


emphasize
 the
 word
 relative.
 Uh
 earlier


this
 week,
 Health
 Minister
 Sylvia
 Jones


touted
 the
 government's
 record
 in


expanding
 access
 to
 primary
 care
 and


said
 the
 government
 is
 on
 track
 to


connect
 everyone
 who
 needs
 one
 with
 a


family
 doctor
 by
 2029.


>> Uh
 Jones
 made
 the
 announcement
 with
 Dr.


Jane
 Philpot,
 uh
 who
 our
 audience
 will


remember
 was
 recruited
 by
 the
 government


to
 uh
 lead
 this
 file,


>> former
 federal
 liberal,
 actually
 health


minister.


>> Yes.
 Um
 so
 2029
 is
 a
 way
 off
 but
 it
 is


still
 within
 the
 likely
 lifespan
 of
 the


current
 legislature.
 So
 it's
 not
 that


distant.
 Uh
 and
 there
 is
 some
 more


immediate
 milestones
 the
 government
 says


they
 have
 passed
 or
 very
 nearly
 have.
 Uh


they
 say
 they
 are
 on
 track
 to
 exceed


their
 target
 of
 attaching
 300,000


Ontarians
 to
 primary
 care
 for
 the
 202526


fiscal
 year.
 Now
 those
 targets
 start
 to


get
 harder
 for
 the
 government
 in
 future


years.
 uh
 they've
 got
 to
 connect
 500,000


people
 with
 doctors
 in
 the
 coming
 fiscal


year
 uh
 and
 then
 600,000
 each
 in
 2027


and
 2028.
 So
 fair
 to
 say
 that
 is
 a
 a
 big


list
 and
 obviously
 we
 can't
 say
 whether


they
 will
 in
 fact
 uh
 clear
 that
 bar.


>> So
 as
 we
 track
 whether
 or
 not
 the


government
 is
 fulfilling
 its
 commitment.


Can
 we
 say
 that
 the
 number
 of
 people
 who


now
 have
 doctors
 is
 a
 higher
 number
 or
 a


lower
 number?


>> Oh
 we're
 that
 simple.


So
 that
 um
 2
 million
 number
 that
 we
 have


referred
 to
 both
 today
 and
 on
 previous


podcasts
 comes
 from
 a
 collective
 of


researchers
 called
 uh
 inspire
 PHC.
 Uh


the
 auditor
 general
 in
 fact
 used
 their


estimate
 in
 her
 annual
 report
 last
 year.


But
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 cases
 where
 the


best
 estimate
 we
 have
 uh
 is
 also
 just
 an


estimate.
 If
 you
 go
 to
 their
 website,


they've
 actually
 said
 they
 are
 updating


their
 methodology
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 just


read
 the
 quote
 directly
 here.
 We


anticipate
 that
 the
 number
 of
 unattached


is
 likely
 to
 be
 lower
 than
 previously


reported.


>> Likely
 to
 be
 lower
 than
 previously


reported.


>> So
 it's
 it
 it
 is
 likely
 to
 be
 smaller


than
 that
 2
 million
 number.


>> So
 that's
 good.


>> Right.
 So
 that
 you
 know
 the
 number
 of


people
 without
 a
 a
 primary
 care
 provider


uh
 in
 Ontario
 is
 very
 likely
 uh
 smaller


than
 what
 we've
 been
 discussing.


>> So
 that's
 encouraging.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is.
 And
 you
 know
 if
 if
 people


remember
 like
 the
 the
 auditor
 general


report
 was
 was
 pretty
 clear
 that
 uh
 with


the
 number
 of
 unattached
 people
 in
 the


province
 uh
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 the


auditor
 general
 did
 not
 think
 that
 we


were
 on
 track
 to
 um
 uh
 connect
 as
 many


people
 with
 healthcare
 providers
 uh
 as


uh
 the
 government
 had
 claimed.


>> What
 else
 about
 the
 AG?


>> So
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 useful
 point
 for


the
 audience
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 just
 when


you're
 reading
 the
 news
 in
 general.
 Um,


folks
 might
 remember
 that
 in
 her
 report,


uh,
 Auditor
 General
 Shelley
 Spence
 had


very
 specific
 things
 to
 say
 about


something
 called
 Healthcare
 Connect.


This
 was
 the
 system
 that
 Ontario
 built


to
 match
 people,
 uh,
 who
 needed
 doctors


with
 doctors
 who
 were
 looking
 to
 take
 on


new
 patients.
 Uh,
 Spence
 reported
 that


uh,
 doctors
 who
 work
 in
 the
 system
 said


that
 it
 was
 terrible
 and,
 in
 their


words,
 not
 fit
 for
 purpose.
 Uh,
 that
 um,


they
 recommended
 that
 Ontario
 should
 uh,


more
 or
 less
 blow
 it
 up
 and
 start
 from


scratch.
 It
 was
 so
 bad.
 Well,
 here's
 the


funny
 thing.
 Uh,
 of
 the
 nearly
 quarter


million
 people
 who
 were
 on
 the


Healthcare
 Connect
 weight
 list
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 2025,
 just
 over
 50,000
 were


still
 on
 that
 weight
 list
 as
 of
 January


2026.
 And
 the
 government
 says
 it
 hopes


to
 clear
 the
 weight
 list
 by
 spring
 of


this
 year.
 Now,
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 that's


a
 a
 small
 fraction
 of
 the
 overall
 number


of
 people
 who
 still
 need
 doctors
 in


Ontario.
 Uh
 but
 that's
 a
 substantial


success,
 one
 that
 I
 think
 the
 government


uh
 uh
 can
 justifiably
 claim
 some
 credit


for.
 Um
 but
 uh
 yeah,
 they
 they
 have


substantially
 resolved
 one
 of
 the
 most


headline
 grabbing
 issues
 uh
 that
 the


auditor
 general
 uh
 spotlighted.


>> Is
 it
 the
 government's
 view
 that
 the


auditor
 general
 was
 simply
 wrong
 about


this?


>> Well,
 they
 would
 never
 say
 so,
 of


course,
 at least
 thought
 on
 the
 record.


Um
 you
 know,
 but
 it
 does
 sound
 like


that,
 right?
 and
 and and
 you
 could
 get


that
 impression.
 Um
 it
 turned
 out
 that


there
 were
 a
 number
 of
 relatively


straightforward
 changes
 including


changes
 that
 the
 auditor
 general
 had


recommended
 and
 that
 the
 Ministry
 of


Health
 uh
 accepted
 as
 recommendations
 uh


to
 make
 healthcare
 connect
 work
 better.


It
 did
 not
 need
 to
 be
 totally
 blown
 up


and
 rebuilt
 from
 scratch.
 Um
 and
 and


again
 remember
 that
 it
 was
 not
 the


auditor
 general
 saying
 tear
 it
 all
 down.


It
 was
 the
 auditor
 general
 saying


doctors
 in
 the
 system
 were
 saying
 tear


it
 all
 down.
 Uh
 her
 actual


recommendations
 were
 much
 more
 measured.


Um
 what
 I
 would
 say
 though,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 this
 is
 both
 an
 example
 to
 sort
 of


the
 general
 public,
 to
 our
 audience,
 and


also
 to
 uh
 reporters
 that,
 you
 know,
 we


love
 the
 Auditor
 General's
 annual


reports.
 They
 are
 kind
 of
 like
 Christmas


for
 us.
 They
 they
 always
 provide


>> cha
 block
 full
 of
 malfeasants.


>> Absolutely
 right.
 Juicy
 headlines


galore.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 it's
 important
 to
 uh


read
 those
 reports.
 And
 you
 know
 the
 the


headlines
 are
 a
 good
 hook
 into
 uh
 what


are
 often
 really
 substantive
 uh


criticisms
 and
 substantive
 evaluations


of
 things
 where
 like
 the
 government
 is


not
 getting
 things
 right.
 Um
 but
 it
 is


also
 the
 case
 uh
 that
 uh
 sometimes
 the


the
 substance
 of
 the
 reports
 is
 more


measured
 than
 what
 makes
 the
 headlines.


>> This
 reminds
 me
 of
 our
 friend
 Martin


Redcon
 from
 the
 Toronto
 Star
 who
 writes


a
 column
 probably
 once
 a
 year
 where
 he


asks
 who's
 minding
 the
 minders,
 right?


as
 in
 the
 auditor
 general
 is
 keeping
 an


eye
 on
 everybody
 else,
 but
 who's
 keeping


an
 eye
 on
 the
 auditor
 general?
 Anyway,
 I


look
 forward
 to
 reading
 that
 column
 by


Martin
 at
 some
 point
 this
 year
 when
 he


writes
 it
 again.
 And
 with
 that,
 we're


off
 to
 issue
 three.


>> Ontario's
 public
 servants
 have
 been


ordered
 back
 into
 the
 office
 5
 days
 a


week.
 Doug
 Ford
 said
 the
 move
 will
 help


increase
 productivity.
 Union
 leaders


have
 said
 it
 will
 hurt
 productivity.


Workers
 have
 complained
 about
 the
 lack


of
 office
 space
 available.
 Doug
 Ford


says
 that's
 just
 a
 bump
 in
 the
 road
 and


that
 space
 is
 coming.
 I
 guess
 hybrid


work
 is
 a
 thing
 of
 the
 past
 now.
 Eh,


>> uh
 so
 it
 would
 seem
 uh
 just
 to
 refresh


people's
 memories.
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 you


know
 the
 long
 shadow
 of
 the
 co
 pandemic


right
 during
 uh
 co
 19
 Ontario's
 public


servants
 were
 ordered
 to
 work
 from
 home


wherever
 possible.
 Uh
 we
 are
 of
 course


some
 of
 those
 workers.
 I
 remember
 gosh,


you
 know,
 6
 years
 ago
 or
 not
 quite
 6


years
 ago
 now
 being
 told
 like
 basically


pack
 up
 your
 stuff,
 go
 home
 and
 we're


going
 to
 start
 working
 from
 home.
 Uh
 you


and
 I
 uh
 in
 a
 earlier
 incarnation
 of


this
 podcast
 recorded
 from
 our


respective
 homes
 for
 many
 months.


>> Actually,
 you
 recorded,
 if
 I
 recall,
 not


from
 your
 respective
 home,
 but
 from
 your


respective
 broom
 closet.


>> Yeah,
 my
 linen
 closet
 on
 on
 the
 second


floor
 of
 my
 house.
 And
 we
 we
 kept
 doing


that
 right
 into
 the
 summer
 and
 it
 got


very
 hot
 and
 uncomfortable.


Um
 but
 you
 know
 obviously
 the
 government


has
 slowly
 started
 to
 bring
 workers
 uh


back
 into
 the
 office
 but
 um
 you
 know


until
 relatively
 recently
 it
 was
 still


at
 least
 nominally
 committed
 to
 what
 it


called
 like
 the
 flexibility
 of
 of
 hybrid


work.
 It
 uh
 advertised
 that
 it
 was
 a
 a


progressive
 employer
 if
 I
 could
 put
 it


that
 way.
 Um
 and
 that
 it
 saw
 some
 value


in
 in
 that
 flexibility.
 Um
 and
 then
 yeah


this
 uh
 uh
 I
 guess
 just
 this
 past
 August


they
 announced
 that
 uh
 they
 will
 uh
 it


started
 with
 4
 days
 a
 week
 it
 has
 now


gone
 to
 5
 days
 a
 week.
 Uh
 you
 know
 the


government
 says
 of
 course
 this
 will
 um


improve
 productivity
 and
 you
 know
 there


is
 some
 evidence
 to
 suggest
 that
 uh


bringing
 everybody
 into
 uh
 the
 office


can
 uh
 improve
 workplace
 productivity.


OPSU,
 one
 of the
 major
 unions
 uh


representing
 public
 service
 employees


says
 that,
 you
 know,
 commuting
 is
 not
 in


fact
 productive
 time.
 Uh
 it's


particularly
 unproductive
 in
 a
 city
 that


is
 already
 choked
 by
 traffic
 congestion.


I
 would
 mention
 uh
 it's
 bad
 for
 the


environment,
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 So


obviously
 very
 different
 perspectives
 on


this.


>> At
 the
 risk
 of
 doing
 a
 little
 naval


gazing
 here,
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 that
 when
 we


had
 our
 editorial
 meetings


>> on
 Zoom,
 Yes.
 as
 opposed
 to
 at
 the
 desk


where
 everybody
 gathers
 around
 the
 desk


and
 really
 kind
 of
 goes
 at
 it
 hammer
 and


tongue.
 If
 you
 pitch
 a
 story
 idea,
 you


better
 be
 prepared
 to
 defend
 that
 idea


or
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 other


producers,
 you
 know,
 coming
 at
 you.


>> The
 dynamic
 of
 everybody
 being
 there
 in


person,
 I
 thought
 was
 important
 and
 was


useful
 and
 Zoom
 just
 wasn't
 the
 same.


>> Yes.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 I
 will
 confess


there
 are
 a
 few
 moments
 during
 the


course
 of
 a
 day
 in
 an
 office
 where


people
 drop
 by
 other
 people's
 offices


and
 aren't
 necessarily
 the
 most


productive
 possible.
 Is
 that
 nice
 a
 nice


enough
 way
 to
 put
 it?
 They
 may
 be
 doing,


you
 know,
 five
 minutes
 of
 chitchat


gossip
 here,
 which
 is
 not
 what
 you'd


call
 incredibly
 productive.
 So,
 I
 do
 see


both
 sides
 of
 this.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 am


I
 like
 working
 in
 a
 newsroom,
 right?
 I


like
 when
 the
 newsroom
 is
 busy
 and
 and


we
 have
 lots
 of
 co-workers
 and
 and
 you


know
 you
 can
 um
 uh
 going
 to
 use
 a
 short


hand
 for
 this
 that
 would
 not
 be


appropriate
 but
 uh
 you
 can
 uh
 uh
 discuss


various
 matters
 of
 of
 uh
 importance
 even


if
 it's
 not
 directly
 uh
 you
 know
 what


you're
 working
 on
 at
 the
 moment
 and
 and


it's
 also
 like
 it
 is
 helpful
 for
 uh


everybody
 on
 the
 team.
 I
 mean,
 it


probably
 will
 not
 shock
 you
 that,
 you


know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 will
 come
 by
 my


desk
 to
 ask,
 you
 know,
 to
 to
 just
 check


a
 quick
 thing
 about
 Ontario
 politics
 or


Ontario
 government
 or,
 hey,
 you
 know,


stuff
 about
 municipal
 policy.
 Can
 I
 ask


you
 a
 quick
 thing?
 Right.
 I
 get
 a
 lot
 of


those
 types
 of
 questions
 when
 I'm
 at
 the


desk.


>> Or,
 how
 about
 this
 person
 is
 a
 guest,


Steve,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 of
 this?
 Yeah,


we
 get
 that
 all
 the
 time.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so,
 I
 absolutely
 I
 think


there's
 there's
 value
 to
 that.
 But
 um


you
 know
 I
 already
 mentioned
 like
 you


know
 the
 the
 the
 policy
 change
 really


started
 in
 in
 August
 and
 and
 I
 do
 um


want
 to
 to
 mention
 this
 again
 that
 you


know
 you
 might
 remember
 during
 co
 um
 I
 I


remember
 there
 was
 a
 a
 push
 for
 large


employers
 to
 give
 as
 much
 not
 notice
 as


possible
 to
 their
 workers
 uh
 before


September


>> because
 if
 they
 were
 going
 to
 be
 called


back
 to
 the
 office,
 people
 wanted
 to


make
 sure
 that
 they
 could
 organize
 their


lives
 around
 getting
 their
 kids
 to


school.


>> Absolutely.


>> Uh
 the
 government
 announced
 this
 change


starting
 in
 August.
 You
 know,
 people
 had


weeks
 to
 start
 getting,
 you
 know,
 making


pretty
 substantial
 changes
 to
 uh
 their


their
 planning
 for
 their
 households.
 Uh


now,
 obviously,
 it's
 been
 a
 few
 months


since
 then.
 January,
 you
 know,
 is
 is
 is


a
 bit
 different.
 Um
 but
 certainly
 one
 of


the
 allegations
 from
 the
 unions
 is
 that


this
 is
 less
 about
 government


productivity
 in
 the
 public
 sector
 and


has
 actually
 been
 implemented
 in
 a
 way


to
 be
 as
 ownorous
 as
 possible
 for


workers
 and
 to
 try
 and
 uh
 shrink
 the


government's
 payrolls
 uh
 without


actually
 doing
 a
 a
 full-scale
 layoff.


Well,
 here's
 part
 of
 the
 other
 tricky


aspect
 of
 this,
 and
 that
 is
 if
 you
 go


downtown
 to
 Bayon
 Welssley
 in
 downtown


Toronto,
 you
 will
 see
 fencing
 all
 around


a
 complex
 where
 Ontario
 public
 servants


have
 worked
 for
 whatever
 it
 is,
 50,
 60


years
 because
 it's
 under
 renovation


right
 now.


>> Yes.


>> So,
 okay,
 you're
 calling
 everybody
 back


to
 work
 5
 days
 a
 week.
 Where
 exactly
 do


you
 intend
 to
 put
 them
 all
 because
 there


is
 a
 space
 shortage
 right
 now?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 Now,
 of
 course,
 the


government
 says
 that
 uh
 you
 know,
 they


they
 have
 uh
 acquired
 more
 space
 where


they've
 needed
 to.
 Um
 it'll
 be


interesting.
 I
 certainly
 I
 intend
 to
 ask


it,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 spring
 budget
 like


what
 what
 what
 has
 been
 the
 cost
 to
 the


public
 treasury
 of
 uh
 you
 know,


acquiring
 uh
 this
 new
 office
 space.


>> I'm
 betting
 it's
 more
 than
 a
 $1.95.


>> I'm


>> that's
 what
 I'm
 betting
 plus
 HST.


>> Yes,
 I
 suspect
 that's
 correct.
 One
 more


thing
 we
 have
 to
 hit
 on
 this
 and
 that
 is


>> optics.


>> Yes.


>> Now
 I
 know
 there's
 reality
 in
 real
 life


but
 then
 then
 in
 politics
 there's
 optics


and
 optics
 matter
 almost
 as
 much
 as


reality
 sometimes
 more.
 You've
 got
 MPPPs


returning
 to
 Queens
 Park
 on
 March
 23rd.


>> Normally
 MPPPS
 are
 back
 in
 their
 head


office
 right
 after
 family
 day
 which
 is


you
 know
 about
 a
 month
 from
 now.
 There


have
 been
 I
 won't
 saying
 this
 is


unprecedented.
 is
 not
 unprecedented,
 but


there
 have
 been
 precious
 few
 governments


in
 Ontario
 history
 that
 are
 sitting


fewer
 days
 at
 the
 legislature
 than
 this


one.
 They
 are
 taking
 a
 very
 long
 winter


break
 away
 from
 the
 legislature,
 which


coincidentally
 means
 ministers
 are
 not


having
 to
 stand
 up
 in
 question
 period


and
 defend
 what
 they're
 doing.
 Now,
 we


know
 I'm
 not
 taking
 a
 cheap
 shot
 here.


They're
 not
 on
 holiday,
 right?
 It's
 not


a
 four-month
 holiday
 break
 or
 something.


Uh
 they
 are
 back
 in
 their


constituencies.
 They
 are
 working.


They're
 doing
 constituency
 work.
 Having


said
 that,
 talk
 to
 us
 about
 the
 optics


of
 forcing
 public
 servants
 back
 into
 the


office
 while
 the
 MPPPs
 are
 taking
 one
 of


the
 longest
 breaks
 away
 from
 the
 office


ever.
 Right.
 So,
 as
 you
 say,
 the
 optics


are
 not
 great
 and
 we've
 already
 talked


about
 the
 weather
 and
 just
 as
 we
 are


recording
 this,
 I'm
 already
 seeing


reports
 that
 um
 it
 has
 not
 been
 made


clear
 to
 members
 of
 the
 public
 service


whether
 they
 have
 to
 come
 into
 the


office
 today
 or
 not.
 Um,
 clearly
 they


have
 not
 worked
 everything
 out.
 Let
 me


just
 put
 it
 that
 way.
 It
 would
 be
 a


different
 story
 if
 we
 had
 not
 just
 had
 a


extended
 uh
 summer
 recess
 immediately


before
 this,
 right?
 Like
 they
 had
 a
 very


short
 fall
 session.
 They're
 now
 gearing


up
 to
 have
 a
 pretty
 short
 spring


session.
 And
 you
 know,
 things
 continue


to
 happen
 that
 just
 from
 a
 a
 principle


of
 like
 democratic
 accountability,
 you


would
 think
 like
 it
 would
 be
 really
 good


to
 have
 uh
 the
 Minister
 of
 Labor,
 for


example,
 continuing
 to
 answer
 questions


in
 question
 period
 about
 the
 skills


development
 fund
 scandal,
 which
 uh


continues
 to
 uh
 uh
 develop.
 Let
 me
 put


it
 that
 way.
 Um


>> I'm
 betting
 he
 doesn't
 mind
 that
 Queens


Park
 isn't
 sitting
 right
 now.


>> Well,
 I'm
 I'm
 sure
 he
 does
 not
 mind.
 Um


uh
 and
 yet
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the


principle
 is
 that
 actually
 you
 know
 the


government
 should
 have
 to
 suffer
 some


things
 here.
 Um
 so
 yeah
 I
 would
 just
 say


that
 uh
 uh
 as
 you
 say
 it's
 not
 that
 like


everybody
 is
 in
 St.
 Bart's
 you
 know
 on


the
 beach
 sipping
 you
 know
 my
 ties
 all


>> okay
 uh
 for
 the
 entire
 break
 although
 I


imagine
 some
 of
 them
 are
 have
 gotten


away
 to
 warmer
 climates
 while
 they
 can.


Um
 but
 there
 is
 just
 this
 this
 basic


question
 of
 you
 know
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 we
 do
 elect
 MPPPs
 to
 the
 assembly


and
 I
 think
 there
 should
 be
 a


presumption
 that
 the
 assembly
 should
 be


sitting
 to
 do
 important
 work.
 I
 will


point
 out
 that
 like


>> the
 federal
 parliament
 uh
 is
 taking
 a


much
 shorter
 I
 think
 their
 break
 might


already
 be
 over
 or
 might
 almost
 be
 over


soon.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 it
 is
 certainly


possible
 for
 elected
 officials
 to
 get
 uh


to
 to
 do
 their
 work
 in
 the
 the
 public


assemblies
 to
 which
 they
 are
 elected.


Indeed.
 And
 with
 that,
 we're
 off
 to
 your


column,
 my
 column.


Okay,
 folks.
 You
 know
 how
 this
 goes.


John
 Michael
 and
 I
 write
 a
 column
 every


week
 for
 the
 TVO
 website,
 tvO.org.
 And


we
 call
 this
 little
 segment
 your
 column,


my
 column,
 in
 which
 we
 discuss
 those


columns
 with
 each
 other.
 JMM,
 what
 will


you
 favor
 us
 with
 this
 week?
 So,
 I
 am


actually
 going
 to
 take
 a
 column
 that
 I


wrote
 uh
 last
 week
 uh
 about
 the
 Ontario


Liberal
 Party.
 Uh
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 start


by
 talking
 about
 uh
 politics
 in
 Quebec


where
 actually
 things
 have
 evolved
 since


I
 first
 wrote
 this
 column.
 Uh
 currently


the
 uh
 governing
 uh
 party
 uh
 Fran
 Go's


party
 uh
 the


coales
 de
 Quebec
 uh
 Premier
 Lego
 has


announced
 his
 resignation.
 His
 party


will
 be
 looking
 for
 a
 new
 leader.
 uh
 and


the
 uh
 Quebec
 Liberal
 Party
 uh
 this
 is


what
 prompted
 this
 column.
 Uh
 their


leader
 has
 also
 resigned
 and
 they
 are


going
 to
 have
 a
 leadership
 race
 uh
 in
 uh


that
 will
 select
 a
 leader
 might
 actually


end
 up
 happening
 before
 we
 even
 know


when
 the
 Ontario
 Liberal
 race
 starts.
 Um


>> in
 other
 words,
 quickly.


>> It's
 they
 are
 doing
 it
 very
 quickly.
 Now


the
 reason
 that
 it's
 happening
 very


quickly
 in
 Quebec
 is
 is
 very
 different


than
 the
 Ontario
 context.
 Quebec
 is


going
 to
 have
 an
 election
 uh
 later
 this


year
 and
 so
 there's
 obviously
 more
 time


pressure
 and
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 uh
 ignore


that
 or
 deny
 that
 but
 it
 is
 still
 the


case
 that
 when
 I
 wrote
 that
 column
 Kroby


had
 announced
 her
 intention
 to
 resign
 uh


months
 ago
 and
 we
 had
 no
 sign
 from
 the


Liberal
 Party
 formally
 about
 when
 the


leadership
 race
 to
 replace
 her
 uh
 would


start.
 Now,
 off
 the
 record
 in
 the


background,
 people
 are
 saying,
 "Oh,


well,
 you
 know,
 we're
 doing
 lots
 of


consultations
 and
 uh
 you
 know,
 uh
 we


want
 to
 hear
 from
 the
 membership
 about


what
 kind
 of
 a
 race
 they
 want."
 But
 I


mean,
 in
 any
 given
 week
 when
 I'm
 talking


to
 Liberals,
 like
 nobody
 seems
 to
 have


any
 clarity
 about
 even
 a
 basic
 question


about
 like
 will
 this
 be
 a
 short
 race
 or


will
 this
 be
 a
 long
 race?
 And
 that's


like
 one
 of
 the
 most
 basic
 questions
 uh


that
 the
 party
 needs
 to
 answer.
 Now,


since
 we
 published
 uh
 that
 column,
 of


course,
 we
 got
 some
 more
 news
 that
 uh


Bonnie
 Krombi,
 who
 had
 said
 that
 she


intended
 to
 stay
 on
 until
 her


replacement
 was
 selected
 by
 the
 party,


uh
 in
 fact
 earlier
 this
 week,
 she


announced
 that
 she
 is
 resigning


effective
 immediately.
 Uh
 I
 believe
 next


week
 the
 uh
 Liberal
 caucus
 will
 uh


select
 an
 interim
 leader.
 Uh
 it
 has
 been


John
 Fraser
 two
 or
 three
 times,
 twice


before.
 Um
 and
 he
 he
 I
 think
 has
 been
 uh


serving
 the
 role
 of
 of
 the
 parliamentary


leader
 and
 and
 I
 I
 think
 has


functionally
 been
 uh
 doing
 most
 of
 the


roles
 of
 of
 the
 party
 leader
 uh
 since


Cromby's
 um
 defeat
 in
 that
 that
 vote.
 Uh


>> just
 on
 that
 point,
 can
 I
 interject
 one


quick
 thing?
 One
 of
 the
 ideas
 I'm


hearing
 out
 there,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 kind


of
 neat,
 I've
 never
 seen
 it
 happen


before,
 is
 that
 rather
 than
 do
 one


interim
 leader
 between
 now
 and
 whenever


the
 permanent
 leader
 is
 selected,


>> they
 should
 do


>> they
 should
 give
 everybody
 a
 spin
 on
 the


bike.
 They
 should
 let
 every
 MPP
 in
 the


caucus,
 and
 there's
 only
 14
 of
 them
 or


so,
 let
 each
 of
 them
 have
 a
 couple
 of


months
 at
 the
 job


>> and
 um
 gives
 them
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 ice


time.
 Shows
 the
 liberal
 backbench
 a


little
 bit
 more.
 Remember,
 they're
 in


third
 place
 in
 the
 legislature.
 They


don't
 get
 as
 much
 ice
 time
 as
 everybody


else.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 um,
 and
 anyway,
 I
 don't know
 if


they're
 going
 to
 do
 that,
 but
 that
 idea


is
 percolating
 out
 there.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 and
 you
 know,
 it's
 complicated


by
 the
 fact
 that,
 you
 know,
 at least,


uh,
 some
 members
 of
 the
 caucus
 uh,


pretty
 clearly
 do
 not
 want
 the
 permanent


leader
 job.
 Like
 Fraser
 has
 always
 said


that
 he's
 not
 interested
 in
 being
 a


permanent
 leader.
 Uh,
 Kingston
 in
 the


islands
 MP
 Ted
 Shu
 has
 has
 uh,
 publicly


said
 he
 he
 will
 not
 uh,
 seek
 the


leadership.
 Others
 are
 still
 uh,


considering
 it.
 Um
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 some


of
 them
 frankly
 deserve
 uh
 that
 kind
 of


prominence
 but
 all
 of
 this
 is
 still
 you


know
 a
 question
 of
 like
 when
 will
 the


race
 actually
 happen
 and
 as
 we
 record


this
 we
 still
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 length


of
 the
 race
 will
 be
 what
 the
 structure


will
 be
 there's
 some
 discussion
 about


whether
 they
 allow
 online
 voting
 or
 not.


Um,
 and
 then
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 aside


from
 the
 caucus,
 uh,
 there
 are


potential,
 uh,
 federal,
 uh,
 MPs,
 federal


liberal
 MPs
 who
 might
 be
 interested,
 uh,


in
 the
 job
 as
 well.
 Uh,
 most
 notably,


uh,
 Beaches
 East
 York
 MP
 NK
 Smith,
 who


is
 sort
 of
 always
 there
 in
 the


background,
 uh,
 uh,
 being
 mentioned
 as
 a


a
 possible
 candidate
 and
 I
 said,
 he's


interested
 in
 the
 job.


>> He's,
 I
 think,
 putting
 an
 organization


together
 as
 we
 speak.


>> Yes.
 Anyway,
 and
 he
 came
 second
 last


time,
 so
 it's
 logical
 that
 all
 eyes
 will


turn
 on
 him
 as
 a
 potential
 replacement


for
 Bonnie.


>> And
 how
 about
 you?


>> Well,
 as
 long
 as
 we're
 talking
 about


liberal
 leaders,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 a


former
 liberal
 leader.
 And
 this
 guy


actually
 was
 liberal
 leader
 four
 times,


if
 you
 can
 imagine,
 over
 the
 years.
 I'll


get
 to
 that
 in
 a
 second.
 64
 years
 ago,


this
 coming
 weekend,
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 political
 figures
 in
 Ontario


history
 won
 his
 first
 ever
 election.
 And


I'm
 going
 to
 set
 this
 up
 now.
 Let's
 go


back
 way
 back
 from
 1919


until
 1961.


The
 riding
 of
 Brandt,
 you
 know,
 half


hour
 west
 of
 um
 Hamilton
 was
 represented


by
 one
 guy,
 Harry
 Nixon,
 who
 was


actually
 premier
 in
 1943
 for
 a
 little


while.
 Harry
 Nixon
 is
 the
 longest


serving
 MPP
 in
 Ontario
 history.
 He
 was


the
 MPP
 there
 for
 42
 straight
 years.
 And


in
 1961
 he
 was
 driving
 home
 and
 not
 far


from
 his
 home
 he
 had
 a
 heart
 attack
 on


the
 road
 and
 you
 know
 went
 into
 the


ditch
 and
 died
 at
 the
 age
 of
 70.


Obviously
 a
 personal
 tragedy
 for
 the


Nixon
 family
 but
 a
 you
 know
 a
 political


problem
 for
 the
 Liberal
 party
 which
 now


had
 an
 open
 seat
 and
 they
 needed
 a


candidate
 for
 the
 upcoming
 bi-election.


Mr.
 Nixon's
 33year-old
 son
 Robert
 ran
 to


replace
 him
 as
 the
 Liberal
 MPP.
 Robert


Nixon
 is
 still
 around
 at
 age
 97
 and
 he


is
 still
 a
 force
 of
 nature.
 Sheldon,
 you


want
 to
 put
 the
 picture
 up?
 I
 went
 to


visit
 him
 last
 month.
 There
 he
 is.
 He's


living
 in
 a
 senior's
 residence
 in
 Paris,


Ontario.
 I
 do
 like
 to
 visit
 Mr.
 Nixon
 a


couple
 of
 times
 a
 year
 because
 he's


still
 so
 bloody
 sharp
 and
 has
 so
 many


great
 stories
 from
 the
 Hustings
 uh
 from


back
 in
 the
 day.
 Uh
 he
 actually
 won
 the


leadership
 uh
 and
 poor
 guy
 is
 as
 he


describes
 it.
 I
 was
 right
 off
 the
 turnup


truck
 in
 1967
 having
 won
 the
 leadership


and
 then
 had
 to
 face
 John
 Roberts
 in
 an


election
 shortly
 thereafter
 and
 of


course
 he
 got
 taken
 to
 the
 woodshed
 by


Mr.
 Roberts
 but
 he
 stayed
 on
 his
 leader


and
 ran
 again
 in
 71
 against
 Bill
 Davis.


Mr.
 Davis
 defeated
 him.
 He
 stepped
 down


but
 then
 his
 party
 said
 Bob
 actually
 we


want
 you
 back.
 So
 he
 ran
 again
 for
 the


leadership
 to
 replace
 himself
 and
 won


and
 was
 liberal
 leader
 in
 75.
 So
 keep


track
 now.
 That's
 twice
 he's
 been


liberal
 leader
 now.
 And
 then
 when
 Stuart


Smith
 lost
 the
 election
 in
 77,
 he
 jumped


into
 the
 frey
 and
 became
 interim
 leader


again.


Um
 and
 then
 in
 what
 year?
 1990
 when


David
 Peterson
 lost
 the
 election.
 He
 was


still
 an
 MPP
 at
 that
 point.
 I
 think
 he'd


been
 an
 MPP
 for
 about
 28
 years
 at
 that


point.
 And
 he
 jumped
 into
 the
 breach


again
 and
 became
 interim
 leader
 again


until
 they
 could
 replace
 David
 Peterson


a
 couple
 of
 years
 later.
 So,
 um,
 he's


been
 the
 leader
 of
 the
 Ontario
 Liberals


four
 times.


in
 this
 bi-election
 in
 1962
 coming
 up
 64


years
 ago
 this
 weekend
 on
 the
 very
 first


door
 that
 he
 knocked
 on
 as
 he's


campaigning
 in
 the
 bi-election


a
 dog
 leaps
 at
 him
 bites
 him
 on
 the
 leg


he
 jumps
 back
 his
 pants
 rip
 right
 up
 to


the
 kester


and
 that
 was
 the
 first
 and
 things


fortunately
 for
 him
 got
 a
 little
 bit


better
 after
 that
 and
 he
 did
 end
 up


winning
 the
 bi-election
 and
 stayed
 from


1962
 until
 1991.


And
 of
 course,
 I
 think
 is
 best
 known
 for


having
 been
 David
 Peterson's
 treasurer


from
 1985
 to
 1990.


Um,
 father
 and
 son
 together
 represented


Brandt
 and
 Environs
 from
 1919
 to
 1991.


Wow.


>> And
 I
 am
 willing
 to
 bet
 that
 that's
 a


father-son
 or
 parent
 child
 combination


of
 service
 that
 will
 never
 be
 broken.
 So


anyway,
 Robert
 Nixon,
 happy
 anniversary


this
 weekend.
 Uh
 before
 we
 go
 to
 the


mailbag,
 uh
 we
 have
 a
 little bit
 of
 news


about
 if
 I
 can
 call
 it
 the
 extended


onpie
 family.
 Uh
 we
 talk
 about
 our


columns
 every
 week.
 Uh
 the
 person
 who


edits
 those
 columns
 is
 Nat
 Basin
 who
 is


actually
 on
 pat
 leave.
 Uh
 because
 in
 the


last
 days
 of
 December,
 little
 Edy
 Shas


was
 born.
 Uh
 my
 understanding
 is
 that


mom
 and
 baby
 are
 doing
 well.
 So


congratulations
 to
 Nat
 and
 Colby
 on


their
 beautiful
 baby
 girl.


>> Well
 done.
 And
 just
 so
 you
 know,
 you


know,
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 these
 columns


here
 on
 this
 program,
 these
 columns


don't
 become
 these
 columns
 until
 Nat


says
 they're
 these
 columns.
 He's
 the
 guy


we
 have
 to
 pitch.
 He's
 the
 guy
 who


either
 green
 lights
 or
 red
 lights,
 and


he's
 the
 guy
 who
 edits.
 So,
 we
 love
 Nat


because
 u
 I
 think
 95%
 of
 the
 time
 he


says
 yes,
 which
 I
 appreciate.


>> Yes.
 And
 uh
 thank
 you
 to
 Sarah
 Sweet
 who


has
 stepped
 in
 to
 edit
 while
 Nat
 is
 on


Pat.


>> Amen.
 Now,
 if
 you've
 got
 a
 burning


question
 or
 insightful
 comment,
 we


always
 love
 hearing
 from
 you
 at
 this


special
 email
 address
 on


politics@tvo.org.


JMM,
 what's
 up
 this
 week?


>> So,
 this
 is
 a
 new
 one
 for
 us.
 Uh,


someone
 has
 sent
 us
 a
 video
 question
 for


the
 mailbag.
 This
 comes
 to
 us
 via


listener
 Teddy
 Charles
 in
 Northgore,


Ontario.
 Uh,
 let's
 take
 a
 look.


>> Okay.


>> My
 name
 is
 Omnibus
 Triion.
 I
 seek


counsel
 from
 you,
 Steve
 Pikin,


chronicler
 of
 the
 greatest
 education


minister
 in
 the
 history
 of
 the
 galaxy,


William
 Brendan
 Dates,
 and
 from
 you,


John
 Michael
 McGrath,
 expert
 in
 policy


and
 legislation
 and
 wearer
 of
 snazzy


shirts
 on
 a
 subject
 that
 will
 transform


education.
 In
 Ontario
 school
 boards,
 it


is
 the
 supervisory
 officers,
 not


trustees,
 that
 hold
 much
 of
 the
 actual


power.
 In
 the
 Education
 Act,
 it
 states


that
 to
 become
 a
 supervisory
 officer,


one
 requires
 a
 graduate
 degree,
 but
 no


experience
 running
 a
 school
 is


necessary.
 Many
 of
 the
 greatest


principles
 do
 not
 have
 time
 to
 take
 a


masters.
 They
 are
 too
 busy
 keeping
 their


schools
 staffed,
 running
 breakfast


programs,
 and
 ensuring
 their
 students


are
 safe.
 I
 propose
 the
 regulation
 be


changed
 to
 reflect
 this.
 Is
 this


something
 the
 honorable
 minister
 of


education
 can
 change
 by
 himself
 or
 does


it
 require
 a
 vote
 in
 the
 legislature?


Thank
 you.
 Till
 all
 can
 stand.


>> Oh
 my
 goodness,
 Teddy,
 you
 are


brilliant.
 That
 is
 an
 absolutely


brilliant
 piece
 of
 work.
 And
 I
 guess
 I


should
 say
 for
 those
 who
 are
 listening


on
 podcast
 as
 opposed
 to
 watching
 it
 on


television
 or
 on
 YouTube,
 what
 you
 just


heard
 was
 some
 brilliance
 by
 Teddy


Omnibus
 Trion,
 that
 transformer
 that
 was


generated
 by
 artificial
 intelligence.


And
 you
 know,
 you
 can
 see
 that
 well,
 you


can't
 see,
 but
 if
 I'll
 describe
 it
 for


you,
 there's
 a
 design
 on
 his
 head
 that's


shaped
 like
 a
 trillium.
 Uh
 omnibus,
 like


omnibus
 bills,
 right?
 There's
 the
 name.


And
 the
 word
 on
 the
 bus
 that
 drove
 off


at
 the
 end
 when
 he
 transformed
 himself


from
 a
 robot
 into
 a
 school
 bus,
 uh,
 a


blue
 bus,
 a
 big
 blue
 machine
 on
 the


side,
 referring
 to,
 of
 course,
 the
 42


consecutive
 years
 that
 the
 conservatives


were
 in
 power
 from
 1943
 when
 Harry
 Nixon


lost
 the
 election.
 Uh,
 all
 the
 way


through


>> uh
 to
 George
 Drew
 and
 then
 1985,
 Frank


Miller
 being
 the
 last.
 Anyway,
 he
 asks
 a


really
 good
 question
 there.
 Uh,


brilliant
 piece
 of
 work,
 just
 brilliant.


Anyway,
 what
 is
 the
 answer
 to
 Omnibus's


question?


>> Right.
 So
 the
 question
 is
 about
 uh
 the


supervisory
 officers
 in
 school
 boards


and
 and
 the
 the
 structure
 of
 a
 school


board
 if
 you've
 never
 thought
 of
 it


before,
 right?
 Like
 the
 the
 trustees
 are


not
 uh
 the
 trustees
 we
 elect
 to
 to


oversee
 school
 boards
 are
 not
 day-to-day


managers
 of
 the
 schoolboard
 system,


right?
 Um
 so
 the
 supervisory
 officers


are
 the
 people
 who
 hold
 those
 positions


basically
 uh
 inside
 the
 bureaucracy
 of


the
 school
 board
 itself
 but
 who
 are
 not


in
 the
 schools,
 right?
 They
 are
 not
 the


principles,
 the
 teachers,
 um
 those


people.
 they
 they
 are
 the
 people
 in
 the


bureaucracy
 of
 the
 schoolboard
 making


decisions
 that
 might
 get
 implemented
 at


the
 school
 level.
 And
 so
 uh
 and
 the
 the


government
 or
 the
 Ontario
 Education
 Act


uh
 does
 spell
 out
 that
 you
 have
 to
 have


uh
 certain
 qualifications
 to
 be
 uh
 a


director
 of
 education
 who
 sort
 of
 like


the
 chief
 supervisory
 uh
 officer
 or


other
 uh
 positions
 as
 well.
 Um
 to


Teddy's
 direct
 question,
 right,
 this
 is


a
 pretty
 straightforward
 regulation,
 at


least
 in
 the
 the
 current
 version
 of
 the


Education
 Act,
 uh
 it
 gives
 the
 Minister


of
 Education
 the
 power
 to
 uh
 write


regulations
 for
 the
 qualifications
 of


both
 uh
 supervisory
 officers
 and
 the


directors
 of
 education
 uh
 themselves.


And
 the
 the
 text
 is
 pretty
 open-ended,


right?
 the
 minister
 doesn't
 have
 a
 a
 ton


of
 uh
 uh
 caveats
 or
 or
 or
 uh
 things


spelled
 out
 in
 the
 law
 itself
 about
 what


they
 need
 to
 include
 as
 qualifications


for
 uh
 a
 supervisory
 officer.
 So
 in


principle,
 yes,
 the
 minister
 of


education
 could
 change
 the
 regulation
 uh


on
 his
 own
 with
 uh
 you
 know
 cabinet


would
 recommend
 the
 the
 change
 in


regulation
 uh
 to
 the
 left
 governor
 who


would
 of
 course
 sign
 it.
 Uh
 have
 to
 be


constitutionally
 correct
 here.
 Um
 now


that
 said
 amending
 the
 rules
 around
 like


job
 qualifications
 and
 uh
 who
 can
 hold


which
 positions
 and
 roles
 in
 the


education
 system
 is
 actually
 like
 fishly


sensitive
 and
 is
 very
 politically


difficult
 and
 I
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 get


into
 you
 know
 examples
 of
 that
 but
 I


will
 simply
 say
 that
 there's
 there's
 the


sort
 of
 legislative
 fact
 that
 like
 yes


the
 minister
 could
 change
 this


regulation
 uh
 himself
 and
 would
 not


require
 a
 a
 vote.
 and
 you
 know
 or
 three


votes
 in
 the
 legislature
 to
 pass
 a
 bill.


Um
 and
 then
 there's
 the
 political
 fact


that
 it
 would
 it
 would
 be
 more
 difficult


than
 just
 the
 straightforward
 laws.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 recommend
 that
 if
 you
 are


listening
 to
 this
 podcast
 right
 now
 as


opposed
 to
 watching
 it,
 just
 go
 on
 the


YouTube
 and
 FF
 to
 the
 end
 and
 see


Teddy's
 masterwork
 because
 that's
 really


a
 beautiful
 piece
 of
 work
 he
 did
 to
 see


how
 he
 posed
 that
 question.
 So
 I
 guess


we
 should
 encourage
 people
 to
 give
 us


their
 questions
 not
 just
 on
 the
 email


address
 but
 by
 video
 as
 well.
 Yeah.


Well,
 let's
 let's
 start
 a
 trend.
 I
 mean,


it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 generated
 by
 AI.
 I


think
 DVO
 has
 an
 AI
 policy
 that
 we
 we


might
 have
 to
 brush
 up
 on,
 but
 uh
 if
 you


want
 to
 send
 us
 uh
 video
 questions,
 I'm


certainly
 open
 to
 it.


>> Good.
 And
 if
 you
 want
 to
 do
 it
 the


oldfashioned
 way,
 what's
 the
 email


address?


>> Right.
 If
 you'd
 like
 to
 ask
 about


content
 on
 the
 show,
 please
 email
 us
 at


onpolitics

>> Beautiful.

 I


think
 we're
 going

>> Yes,
 the
 the
 big
 studio's
 been
 under


renovation.
 Uh
 and
 I
 I

 it's
 uh


you
 know,
 knock
 on
 wood,
 ready
 to
 to


receive
 its
 first
 occupants.


>> Excellent.
 We
 look
 forward
 to

 Now,


just
 one
 more
 note

 Amid
 a


shifting
 international
 order,
 Ottawa

earmarked
 billions
 to
 rearm
 and
 rebuild


the
 Canadian
 Armed
 Forces.
 So,
 we
 will


ask,
 what
 kind
 of
 fighting
 force
 does


Canada
 need
 right
 now
 and
 for
 the
 rest


of
 the
 21st
 century?
