If you go back to the early 1980s
all the way up to the global
financial crisis,
if you had just blindly bought the lowest
quality credit
that's out there, proxied by high yield
senior secured loans, direct lending,
you know, you know, when the index,
you would have ended up
with only about a half a percentage
point of incremental performance versus
high quality bonds over the entire period.
And the way it worked
was that you made a lot of money,
a lot of money, a lot of money,
a lot of money. Then you gave it all back.
Yeah, you made a lot,
a lot of a lot, lot. Getting it all back.
We'd go back to the,
you know, late 80s when you had,
you know, that period,
initial period of aggressive underwriting.
You had the savings
and loan crisis of the early 90s.
You had the ltcM or the Asian
financial crisis in the late 90s,
then the internet bubble
and the telecom issues of the early 2000.
Then,
of course, the global financial crisis
that was a more normal credit
environment up
since the GFC,
just blindly buying that lowest quality
credit on the board, whether it's private
credit or lower quality public credit,
you generated 7% a year
more than high quality bonds. Wow.
And that explains a lot.
Not surprisingly, you've seen massive
growth in that area of the market.
Hello,
and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy, you know, we've been doing
this podcast for ten years.
I am actually, I am aware, you know, a
whole decade and we've been doing
episodes talking about big picture things
and things that have changed
and what's different now in 2025 or 2015
when we started.
And some things are the same
and some things are different, etc..
But I think
and we've mentioned this before,
I think the one thing that could not be
more different is the rates environment.
We were right in the middle of,
like this is a decade or the year
or maybe in 2015, maybe at that point
the fed had tried to hike
one time already, and then the market
sort of slapped it down and said,
oh no, no, no, no more.
We're not ready for more rate hikes, etc.
the rate environment
could not be more different
than when we first started this podcast.
I mean, absolutely.
Can I say one thing about the anniversary?
Yeah.
So we started the podcast in November
2015.
Yeah.
We were going to celebrate for the month
of November, but we're now in December.
So are we going to make this a two month
celebration?
Well, you know, we're having our ten year
anniversary party in December,
so I think it's allowed to,
you know,
it's allowed to bleed
the ten years into both months,
given that we're formally
celebrating in December.
I think this is how I'm rationalizing this
framing for this conversation, since,
yes, we are no longer we're technically
no longer an anniversary month.
I guess it's our party
and we can disagree as long as we do it.
However we want.
But you're absolutely right
about the rates of environment.
And, you know,
you could see that if you go back
and look at some of the old podcast
episodes.
The other thing that strikes me
looking back at the old podcast episodes
is how many of them were about
shadow banking?
Which of course
nowadays we call private crime.
Yeah.
And that's another thing
that's changed enormously.
So the private credit market
now basically rivals
the public credit market in terms of size.
And there's obviously a lot of concern
about what that means.
The outlook.
Lots of differences. Lots of differences.
Yeah. Completely dramatic.
And these days of course,
we are in the middle of some setting aside
the big picture questions.
There are also some,
small picture questions,
maybe how you put immediate questions.
At the time we were recording this,
it looks like the December
meeting is basically a lock,
that there's going to be a cut.
But up until recently,
there was a lot of market uncertainty.
If we recorded this two weeks ago,
it would have looked very different,
would have looked very different.
And you know what happens after December?
Highly uncertain on many dimensions.
The follow through for the rate
cutting cycle, there have been,
increases in various credit
concerns of various sorts.
We've had a few small blowups with, but,
you know,
nothing that big, but like what
Jamie Diamond called the cockroaches.
We mentioned on the show
that suddenly people are talking about
credit default swaps, uncertain high tech
companies, which is very unusual.
But there's a, Star Wars meme.
I haven't heard that word in a long time.
That's right.
But with the AI build out
and how much that's getting financed
by various forms of credit,
suddenly people are talking about the fact
that big tech companies are credits, which
we don't really think about very much.
And so there are some big picture things,
but also some things happening right here
and right now that warrant,
further further understanding
and further explanation from the people
who really understand them. Absolutely.
Well, I'm very excited to say
we really do have the perfect guest,
someone who we've had on the show before,
but someone we love speaking to.
We are going to be speaking with Dan
Ivascyn.
He's the CIO over at Pimco, which
of course, everybody should know about.
So Dan, thank you so much
for coming back on the podcast.
Thanks for having me.
And congratulations on the big ten year
anniversary.
It's a it's an honor to be invited
back, during this series of, podcast.
So thank you so much. Yeah,
very kind of you.
To say let's start small picture.
You know, we have this,
I think this, this episode will be out
before the fed meeting, and the market
is saying it's going to be a lock.
It's going to be,
they're definitely going to cut rates.
But beyond that, when you look into 2026,
there's sort of two different questions.
There's the ongoing uncertainty about
who is going to be the next, fed chair.
And then there's just the the questions
about how much appetite
this existing committee
has to continue a rate cutting cycle.
So I'd love to get, you know,
what are you thinking about
for the 2026 and what,
what we could be expecting.
Sure. So, you know,
we do think, the Fed's likely
to cut rates, at the upcoming meeting.
We also think that this is a fed
that would like to get rates
a bit lower, into 2026.
The challenge, of course, is that
we expect to see a little bit of re
acceleration in the economy,
during the first half of the year.
And we also expect inflation
to remain, comfortably above
the central bank targets.
So, you know,
we believe this fed when they say they're
going to continue to focus on the data.
We do think the data is going to be a bit
confusing.
The general view, you know, today at Pimco
with, you know, significant uncertainty,
is that they probably do get rates down
another half a percent or so next year,
which is close to what's being,
you know, priced into the market today.
But again,
if you see meaningful re acceleration,
in the growth data and more importantly,
if you see,
even a modest uptick in inflation,
this fed, you know,
even with a new chair, will likely,
you know, be willing to remain on hold.
And then I think the other point,
in this came up with, you know,
one of your recent guests is that,
there's the front end policy rate,
and then there's the reaction out
in longer maturities.
We do think there's a chance if this fed
cuts aggressively into strengthening data,
higher inflation,
you may actually get, a sell off,
in the long end of the curve.
So, that could be a bit self-defeating.
And I think, something
that will be a topic into next year
if we do get that we acceleration
that we expect.
There's a lot you said there
that I want to follow up on.
Just in that one answer,
but just very quickly what is the
the idea, the gist behind
why you expect that Q1 re acceleration.
Yeah.
A lot of it's, you know, related to,
significant, momentum,
you know, in terms of capital investment,
you know, associated with AI
as well as the delayed the positive
growth impact of,
the so-called big beautiful bill.
A lot of the corporate,
tax extensions happened
retroactively, for the consumer
or the household.
In many instances, you're going to begin
to see, you know, the direct impact
in terms of positive, you know, refunds,
coming into the New year.
So again, you know, plenty of uncertainty,
you know, a lot of crosscurrents
in this economy.
But we do think there's the chance
that you'll get some,
you know, moderate re acceleration
in the first half of the year.
You know,
we're looking at a growth environment,
you know, for the next year
in the United States at least somewhere
in the one and a half to 2% type range.
So again, that that's an environment
where from a traditional Taylor
rule perspective, we don't think that
the fed needs to cut a lot more from here.
Although, you know,
we do think that this fed particularly
with new membership and a new chair,
would like to get rates lower.
Since you mentioned the new chair.
This is more of a long
term, thoughtful question, but,
obviously,
for the majority of your career
as a bond manager, I don't think fed
independence has really been,
much of a concern.
Right?
We certainly haven't seen the degree
of headlines that we are seeing lately
with, Kevin Hassett emerging
as the frontrunner for the new fed chair
position.
How do you, as a bond manager, view
that particular issue?
And do you have to start handicapping
the way you invest because of this?
I think to a degree, you know, I think
if you go back several decades, you know,
you can question the concept of fed
independence a little bit.
And I think even from the perspective of,
you know, this Fed's expanded mandate
in recent years,
what the market's really focused on
is independence
related to the setting of policy rates.
Which, you know, of course,
have a direct impact on markets.
So from that perspective,
we are monitoring the situation
like other investors.
You know, we do think less independent fed
has implications, particularly
in longer maturities, where you may need
a bit more risk premium,
when you're dealing with, uncertainty
around, you know, fed independence.
But generally speaking, when we think
about, you know, who's being considered,
for the fed role, including Kevin Hassett,
you know,
we do think that there'll be
a general spirit of independence there.
We still think, you know, the chair
is, one vote, so to speak.
And we have a committee that will continue
to focus on the dual mandate.
So yes, it's a consideration.
It's an input into our decisions.
It's not a major concern.
We we do think that, you know, the group
that's being considered.
Are you know, certainly high qualified,
or highly qualified and,
will likely,
you know, continue to take, you know, a
sufficiently independent view,
you know, regarding monetary policy.
Let me ask you kind of the same question,
but with a slightly different framing.
It's December 2025 right now.
So we've had like,
you know, over four years now,
I think over four years
now of the fed missing on its inflation,
on the two, on getting inflation
durably back to 2%.
And if the fed is going to continue
cutting as it looks like it's going to do
in December, that signals
a further willingness to ease policy,
even with inflation over
its ostensible target.
Setting aside
the strict question of independence,
do you think the fed, regardless
even the current composition
and the likely composition
going to be forward is just not going
to take 2% seriously,
as perhaps it might have in the past?
Yes, I think it's a great question.
And I think that, in a general sense,
the 2% target matters, but not so much
the current inflation rate.
You're absolutely right.
We've been operating,
you know, and living with an inflation
rate, meaningfully above their target
for quite some time.
But when you look at
inflationary expectations, and I think
when you talk to central bankers,
you know, here in the United
States as well as outside,
this country,
the inflationary expectations
piece is what's critically important.
So when you look at longer term
break even inflation rates,
they've continued to be very,
very well behaved.
You saw a bit of an uptick, you know,
you know,
at the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.
And then you saw an uptick around the
tariff announcements earlier this year.
But when you look at a ten year
tip break even rate,
just to use one of several proxies,
now the one measures perfect.
You know, you're down around 2.25%
on CPI inflation.
So to the extent that inflationary
expectations remain well contained,
we do think that the central bank's
willing to look through,
some of the more, higher frequency data.
To the extent that you see those longer
term expectations become unanchored,
we do think that's a risk,
for a fed that's, you know, too
aggressive in in cutting rates here.
We do think that the mindset will change
not only the mindset of the fed,
but we think the market reaction, could,
be counterproductive not only in terms
of higher long term interest rates,
but an impact on risk assets as well.
So, you know,
the markets have let the fed get away with
running fairly accommodated policy,
cutting into a 3% type inflation world,
because, again,
there are a lot of other forces at work
that very well could be disinflationary
over the long term.
And there still is significant confidence
in global central banks and being able to
generally keep inflation, you know, close
to the target, on a longer term basis.
So, you know, again, so far so good.
But you know,
this is all going to be a key
source of uncertainty,
you know, into 26 and beyond.
I feel like uncertainty is constantly
the key word on our podcast nowadays.
Since longer dated expectations
and yields keeps coming up
in this conversation, I got to ask,
do you believe in the term premium?
Or rather, is the term premium a useful
concept to you as a big bond investor?
It is.
And you know, when we look at,
you know, where would to invest?
You know, we like to get paid for,
you know, taking more risk.
We do, you know, see an elevated term
premium,
certainly relative
to where we were 5 or 10 years ago.
And that's made longer.
Maturity investments
a bit more attractive.
With that said, there's lots of reasons
why the term premium should be higher.
Inflation is one of them.
Global debt levels, U.S.
debt and deficit levels, are another
and we probably live in a world today,
given what's going on in terms of,
you know, focusing on, you know,
you know, tariffs and bringing back
supply chains, you know, to
domestic markets, the need for,
you know, higher risk premium.
So, you know, as a firm today we,
we like longer maturity bonds more.
But we're still,
you know, tend to keep our positions
concentrated in shorter maturities.
And we would expect over
the next few years a little bit of,
additional underperformance, in the very,
very long end of the yield curve.
So we do think it's important.
It's interesting.
People focus a lot
on, you know, the deficit situation
in the United States as an investor,
you know, you don't want, to lead
into a perfect high quality credit.
You know, you don't get paid
so much to do. So.
So in some sense, we want, you know,
just enough fiscal irresponsibility
where we and our, you know, end investors
get paid more to lend,
but not so much where it becomes a concern
in terms of the overall viability
of, of the system.
So we think we're in the midst
of that type of market environment today.
But things can go a bit too far
if we don't get, you know, the deficit
or the inflation situation under control
over the next couple to few years.
Can you talk about the role of bonds
in a portfolio?
Again,
this is something that in 2015, bonds fit
beautifully into a diversified portfolio
because they were paying something.
But also they had that nice
inverse correlation.
And so you got that natural hedge etc..
We haven't had that very like that
beautiful inverse correlation between risk
assets and bonds for a long time,
which undermines one of the cases
for the diversified investor
of having like a big slug
of perhaps longer duration assets.
How do you think in 2025, how do you sell
the case that diversified investors
should still keep some allocation
to duration or fixed income?
Yeah.
So, you know, it's interesting I know
this is a ten year anniversary show.
So you know, went back and looked at the
performance of bonds versus other things.
You know, over the last ten years.
And the divergence in performance over
the last decade has been remarkable.
And it explains a lot.
If you look at the S&P
500 over the last ten years, in absolute
terms, you generated return of about 15%
a year, adjusted for inflation.
I think it's up
close to, you know, 12% or so.
You know, I'm rounding a little bit
when you look at the performance of,
you know, the the Bloomberg Aggregate
Index over that ten year period,
the return annually has been below
2% in absolute terms.
When you subtract inflation,
you ended up with negative returns,
in bonds for ten years.
So not only has the correlation broken
down, but you didn't make any money.
In owning bonds,
when you look at the starting valuations
today, under any type of reasonable
longer term valuation framework,
none of which have to mean revert quickly.
But, you know, you look at,
you know, Shiller,
you know, p type arrangement
or an equity risk premia type argument.
You don't need a great correlation
on bonds versus equities.
What the relative valuations would suggest
is that there's a good chance
that bonds outperform stocks over the next
5 or 10 years, or at least have returns
on a risk adjusted basis, very,
very close to stocks.
So you don't have to start
a correlation argument.
You know, you don't have to focus on
well bonds do well during you know,
you know, periods where,
you know, people are losing their jobs or,
you know, income growth is negative.
You could just from a pure valuation
perspective, find, the asset class
quite attractive.
Absolutely relative.
I think the second point around
correlations is that correlations between
stocks and bonds will tend to break down
when inflation's the primary risk factor
today.
Yes inflation's above
central bank targets.
But there's a lot of uncertainty.
You know on the economic side
you do have this you know
complex economy
where you know tremendous value.
You know within the tech sector tremendous
capital investment yet lower income
households are feeling considerable pain.
If I is very, very successful,
an increase in productivity,
that could mean significant job
loss across key segments of the economy.
So the bottom line is that
risks are more balanced.
We don't think correlations
are going to ever come back to the really,
really neat, clean levels.
You know, a decade or so ago when
inflation simply wasn't a problem at all.
You know, across the global economy.
But we have seen correlations
improve a bit.
And we would expect that to go forward
basis correlations, to improve further.
I think it's important again,
to look at a global opportunity set.
You know,
I think that the correlation arguments
are stronger in areas of the world
that have the best fiscal position.
But in general, you know,
not only do we think that the valuations
are quite attractive,
you know, we do think the correlations
will be a bit better,
certainly, that we experience
coming out of the Covid period.
So in 2015, bonds were an easy sell.
It turns out they weren't the best
investment 2025 maybe a harder sell.
But the math says that now is actually
now is actually the time to
to expand your exposure.
Well, I guess in ten years
when we do the 20 year anniversary,
we can see how people tend to judge.
But, Dan,
you know, since we're talking about
why people should buy bonds,
one of the surprising things that happened
this year was we had the big tariff
drama, and we saw markets go down
and we saw a bond yields spike.
So everyone was talking
about the Sell America trade.
So this idea that you didn't
want to hold on to U.S assets
because of all that policy uncertainty.
And now, you know, in December
2025, yields have come down quite a lot.
Although I have to say
the dollar is still fairly weak.
You were always, kind of resistant
to the sell America idea
and you pushed back on it.
What did you see
that perhaps others didn't?
Well, again, I think a
lot has to do with starting valuations.
After a significant period
of underperformance, across
U.S fixed income or global fixed income,
you ended up with a decent valuation
cushion.
So I think that's always important
in markets. Yes.
There was news that in a narrow
sense was negative, for bonds
and negative for U.S bonds
or U.S assets in particular.
You started with a decent yield cushion.
You know,
we began the year, you know, with yields,
you know, ten year treasuries,
you know, up near 5%,
a 5% yield even in a 3% inflation.
World's not that bad.
I think the second point, though,
you know, we weren't,
overly convicted
in just owning the United States.
And I think if I could, you know,
the most important thing I can say today
is that global bond investing is back.
For so many years,
capital is poured into the US markets.
It's poured into the US markets
focusing on private credit,
you know, which has grown in the most here
in this country.
But very, very quietly,
you've seen underperformance
across the global
fixed income opportunity set
where today, even,
you know, from a US dollar
based investors perspective, there's great
yield, great sources of diversification.
So it's not that we were, you know, insist
on just owning U.S assets.
In fact, we've gradually diversified
into other areas of the market.
We just thought that there was good
value and good yield in the US,
a sufficient cushion.
And then by extending
into these other markets
a great way to generate incremental return
by good old fashioned relative value
trading in markets today
that are less correlated than they were
during those years coming out of the,
you know, global financial crisis
and where you just have a really,
really exciting time to neutral dual
fashion trading across the yield
curves, across markets.
And avoid having big you're what changed
because that seemed like,
you know, it felt like international
investing across
any asset
class was like a real suckers thing.
It's like,
oh, this is going to be the year
that we're going to diversify
internationally.
And you didn't get paid at all for it.
What is the what what switch flipped
such that actually both stocks too
because international equity markets
have done very well and outperform the US,
which is kind of surprising
in many respects.
But what switch such that now
there's been real opportunities
to make money looking abroad.
You know again valuations have improved.
You know we we talked about you know
the real poor performance of the US
bond market over the last decade.
As we as we all know, yields were outright
negative in many areas of the world.
So we talk about low yields.
You subtract that low inflation rate,
you end up with a negative number.
And big portions of the global
fixed income opportunity set.
You have to subtract anything.
You started with a negative number.
So a lot of this
has just been the reprice to get markets
that started not only at low levels
but negative yield levels.
Then the second piece relates to policy,
coming out of the global financial crisis,
not only were yields low, but you had such
incredible policy activism
where on any signs of economic weakness,
you had a massive fiscal response,
massive monetary policy response,
Covid,
you know, the ultimate, example of that.
And today, you know, with debt levels
and deficit levels where they are
policy makers don't have that flexibility.
So you're you're back to an environment
where markets increasingly
have to stand on their own,
stand on their own based on fundamentals.
And that's just an exciting time.
It means more risk premia in markets,
more term premium, higher yields,
with significant valuation cushion
absolute and relative to what look to be,
you know, quite expensive equity markets
and then just less correlation.
You have situations even over the course
of the last couple of months
where a political surprise in Japan
or France creates
lots of local volatility in those markets.
Uncertainty in French politics impacts
UK politics because they have similar
challenges in terms of getting their,
you know, deficit situation,
in, you know, under control
and economic productivity higher.
So it reminds us a lot
more like the mid 90s.
You know, back before you had this
massive volatility suffocation
from policymakers.
And again with deficits
where they are with inflation
where we're where it is today
versus central bank targets,
it's likely that over
the next several years,
you know you're going to continue
to be in this type of environment.
Good value good relative value.
And then much less correlated markets,
which, you know, lead to,
you know, some some good opportunity
to generate, incremental return above
starting yield levels.
Well, we wanted to talk about
private credit as well, because as we said
in the intro, this is one thing
that has changed quite a lot since 2015.
People obviously have different
characterizations of private credit,
but I'm curious
how you think about that space
and how you would define, you know,
or how you would measure things
like transparency
and opaqueness and customization
in the credit waterfall
and things like that.
Because again, one person's
extremely transparent market
can be another person's opaque
morass of potential defaults.
Not much of this is new.
You know, when I joined Pimco
back in the late 1990s,
I spent the good portion
of my initial time
at the firm focusing on the underwriting
of private assets.
You know, we call them pure privates,
but these were, you know, foray
to privates that were created
as part of the Securities Act of 1933.
144 eight privates,
which are quite popular.
I think the first one
was issued back in 1990.
The technology
that's being utilized to fund,
AI infrastructure today,
some of these off balance sheet contingent
or cold guarantee type frameworks
were around in the mid to late 1990s.
The difference today is that you have this
massive capital investment need.
So the deals are larger.
But a lot of the technology has just been,
you know, dusted off,
so to speak, for, for the new era.
I think the other point that's important.
And when we're talking
about historical returns,
you know,
I think this explains a lot, is that
what's been so unique
in terms of credit asset
performance in general has been the post
global financial crisis period,
where we haven't had a sustained period
of economic weakness.
In fact, one of my favorite, you know,
data series is looking at how lower
quality lending performed since way back
during the Michael Milken days.
You know,
when he helped to create that market.
If you go back to the early 1980s
all the way up to the global
financial crisis,
if you had just blindly bought the lowest
quality credit that's out there, proxy
by high yield senior secured loans,
direct lending, you know, you know, blend
the index, you would have ended up
with only about a half a percentage
point of incremental
performance versus high
quality bonds over that entire period.
And the way it worked,
was that you made a lot of money,
a lot of money, a lot of money,
a lot of money. Then you gave it all back.
Then you made a lot, a lot, a lot,
lot gave it all back.
We go back to the,
you know, late 80s when you had,
you know, that period,
initial period of aggressive underwriting.
You had the savings
and loan crisis of the early 90s.
You had the ltcM or the Asian
financial crisis in the late 90s,
then the internet bubble
and the telecom issues of the early 2000.
Then,
of course, the global financial crisis.
That was a more normal credit environment,
since the GFC, just blindly buying,
that lowest quality
credit on the board, whether it's private
credit or lower quality public credit,
you generated
7% a year more than high quality bonds.
And that explains a lot.
Not surprisingly, you've seen massive
growth in that area of the market. Now,
you know, weaker credit tends to perform
well when stocks go up 15% a year.
But again,
you know, that's where we are today.
I hear all the discussion about God,
you know, underwriting is worse
than the public side
versus the private side.
The reality is when you've grown
this much, when you've lent so much money
to weaker quality borrowers,
when covenants have weakened,
when spreads are tight,
when equities have gone up consistently
as much as they have, you're going to have
challenges, in these markets.
So when we think about credit,
we look at it under
sort of two Continuums one liquidity.
Certain assets are completely illiquid.
The only decision you have to make
is the purchase decision.
So you better be right.
And then at the other end, the extreme,
you have very, very liquid assets
where you can change your mind,
on a regular basis.
And then you have economic sensitivity.
You have assets
that are very insensitive to the economy,
that are very, very high quality.
Then at the other extreme, you have assets
with a tremendous amount of economic
sensitivity, a tremendous amount
of sensitivity to AI related disruption,
other forms of economic weakness,
unanticipated competition.
And you just want to make sure
you get paid enough.
And with stocks near all time highs,
with spreads tight, with covenants
weak, there going to be problems.
And I think as an investor
you just need to acknowledge
that you're not getting paid.
What you got to take that
risk 5 or 10 years ago.
And you just want to be defensive.
You want to be skeptical.
But it's not so much private
versus public.
I think it's just thoughtful underwriting
and just understanding
that we're at a time where,
given the strong historical performance,
given the fact that we haven't
had a sustained period of economic
slowing for a long time,
some complacency has worked.
Their way into these higher
risk areas of the market.
Well, talk a little bit
more about competition in private credit,
because I imagine it's good to be Pimco
when it comes
to sourcing, deals
and maybe negotiating the terms.
But does even someone like you,
a truly big bond manager, have to deal
with competitive pressures
where if you don't agree to one bond term,
someone else will swoop in and agree to
it and take it away from you?
Absolutely.
And again, I think the other point
about public
and private markets
is that they're well integrated.
You know, we could talk about convergence,
you know, a bit later,
have had some views there.
But, you know, when an issuer looks at,
their options,
they're going to test the public, option.
They'll test the private option.
And there is a lot of competition,
a lot of competition for market share.
When you look at a lot of the managers,
particularly in the private credit space,
they announce very, very aggressive
growth assumptions.
You know, as an investor, sometimes,
you know, I wish in certain quarters
people would talk about,
you know, if we could find value for
the end investor, we will grow this much,
all too often, you know,
after a pretty bullish environment
for for credit, it's
we're simply going to grow a lot.
So, you know,
we do see time and time again
situations
where you start the underwriting process,
you get down to the point
where it's time to get into a final round,
and you don't get the terms that we feel
we need as extenders of credit
in this marketplace.
And that's just, again,
symptomatic of the fact
that there's a lot of demand
for these assets.
And, there's a lot of demand relative
to the supply across
many segments of the market.
And that's true not only of,
below investment grade risk, but it's
very, very true of certain transactions,
with an investment grade rating,
at least from a, from a rating agency.
So, you know, given tight spreads, given,
the competition, you just have to say no.
And I'll go back to that.
You know, by my earlier point,
what's so exciting about this market today
is that you do not need to take
on aggressively underwritten credit
to generate return the high quality
area of the market,
especially if you expand globally,
if you take advantage of liquidity,
which typically means flexibility
for end investors,
and you can have a high quality portfolio
where you don't have to
sacrifice return very different
than where we were ten years ago.
But again, pretty exciting.
Now we can go up and quality without again
giving up return and in some cases,
ironically,
you know, picking up, expected return.
I want to go back to something
you said, and I didn't quite get it,
but I think it's important.
And of course, it's very interesting
to our audience.
You talked about the AI financing.
I think you said something contingent
make whole guarantees.
I don't, tell us your
what is the history like.
Tell us about these financing
as you see them.
And what is the history, how novel
are they relative to past financings
or how much is it
that these are structures
that were very much in place for something
else, are now being re proposed into,
into this new, into this new,
exciting area?
Yeah.
So I'll start with, with what's new,
which is, you know, lending
to support the growth
in AI and related infrastructure.
They're, you're talking about several
trillion dollars of investment need.
So that's what's new.
But you know, what's, not so new is
this idea that companies
would like to keep a good portion
of their debt off their balance sheet,
or come up with structures that limit
their overall financial liability,
or give them some flexibility
to manage that liability over time?
And as an end investor, you know,
looking to lend to those companies,
you know, it's important to acknowledge
that lending against tech firms,
lending against AI infrastructure,
lending against AI chips, is risky.
That could be a real good investment
if you own the equity
may not be a great investment.
If you own the bonds, where at most
you get your coupon and you hope to get
PA back at the end of the day.
So a lot of the underwriting of these
transactions and there have been a lot
and we expect a lot more to come,
over the course of the next few years
is to understand
the form of that guarantee and understand
the entity
that's providing that guarantee,
whether it's in the form of lease payments
or other type of make hole type
arrangements.
And these types of structures are what
have been around for many, many years.
You know, back in the mid and late 1990s,
you know, a lot of times
these were would be done by Wall Street
financial institutions.
Sometimes across a segment
of their business where they would use
a corporate guarantee to arbitrage a bit.
The rating agency frameworks
and other times, these deals were backed
by, you know, large, you know, ships,
equipment, other areas of the market.
So it was the same type of analysis,
the same type of underwriting, checklist,
which involves a lot of lawyers, to ensure
that you understand the guarantee,
what you how
you have to realize on that guarantee.
And that's not so different today.
Just to be clear,
the guarantee we're talking about here is.
Okay, here is, a hypothetical SPV
that owns
a data center, and it borrows money
and it finances, etc..
And the guaranteed question is,
how much will the tenant
of that data center, which didn't
want to have all that debt on their books,
maybe like a Facebook
or one of the hyperscalers?
How much are they actually committed
to being a tenant for the long term?
They're basically
that's what we're talking about.
Absolutely correct.
And why it matters here is you're
typically talking about investment
grade rated counterparties
on these transactions,
where the infrastructure itself,
the assets
that are partially backing the deal
on a standalone basis would achieve
a very, very low rating.
So how do you create a structure
where you improve the credit quality,
while meeting the needs of those that
are looking to borrow, within this market.
So again,
the whole key is to make sure that,
something that the rating agencies
may assign,
investment
grade rating to is in fact investment
grade from a fundamental credit
quality perspective.
And I think that's another theme.
You know, in talking about private credit,
you know, there are more
economically sensitive,
lower quality loans.
And then there's that a lot of growth
on the investment grade side.
It is very, very dangerous to assume
something has an investment grade rating
just because the rating agencies assign
a rating to it.
It's critically important
that you do your own credit work today.
All too frequently.
You have, an investment grade
rating from one entity.
And again, market participants for years
have always joked
if you could only find one investment
grade rating, it's
pretty fair to assume everyone else's
below investment grade.
So in the bottom line
is that there's been a lot of aggressive,
underwriting going on,
even with instruments
that carry an investment grade rating
at least from one entity.
And again, when spreads are tight,
when documentation is relatively weak,
it's just critically important that you do
your own fundamental credit work.
I do think Pimco has some advantages
in that area, both in terms of experience
and resources.
But it's super important
because you're not always
getting the terms that you want.
When you do, you can unlock
tremendous value for your clients.
But this is an environment,
where we have to be really,
really selective
as a, as a bond investor at least.
Yeah.
When I think back to, the 2015
environment, I remember a lot of people
were writing stories about the triple B
bubble in investment grade.
So triple B
is the lowest tier of investment grade.
And that had been absolutely exploding
post financial crisis.
And everyone, not everyone.
A lot of people expected
that to end in tears.
And instead it ended
with all those like Triple B's
getting upgraded and a lot of junk
getting upgraded as well,
and having a bunch of rising stars,
which I don't think a lot of people
were necessarily expecting.
But talk a little bit
more about the rating agencies.
What are the pressures that you think are
perhaps driving them to,
rate some of these structures
higher than they otherwise might be?
Well, again, there are multiple rating
agencies that have different philosophies,
to how they arrive at a rating.
And, you know, there's,
there's, there's going to be,
you know, understandable disagreement,
you know, within markets.
But issuers are quite shrewd.
You know, they're going to go
to where they get the most favorable,
ratings treatment.
And this has always been the case.
And I think the important point,
you know, to note
is that when stocks are going up
15% a year, when the economy's
growing, when you don't have
a sustained period of economic weakness,
even poorly underwritten credit,
well, mature.
We experience that in an extreme sense.
You know, during the 2000s,
what we try to do as active,
investors is to underwrite, to weaker
economic environments,
environments where, you know, those
underlying entities or the infrastructure,
you know, that you that you're lending
against go into a period of weakness.
And I think that's where, you know,
good fundamental credit
work in this type of environment
that we're in today.
That's very much driven
by rating arbitrage, you know, seeking out
investment grade ratings,
you know, for an insurance
balance sheet or a reinsurance
balance sheet, as an example,
you know, can lead at times
to aggressive, decisions. So
it's just a nature of the fact
that you have multiple agencies
and some will be more optimistic
in certain areas than others.
But you know, that's great.
You know,
if we didn't have
those sources of disagreement,
there wouldn't be opportunities
to generate,
incremental return,
you know, versus passive alternatives
while we're here on credit, actually,
you know,
I was pro about a month ago
or a month and a half ago.
That's when we were getting
all those headlines about Tree Killer.
And that was when, Jamie Dimon
made the sort of famous crickets thing
I was getting. Really crunches.
Cockroaches, cockroaches.
I hate cockroaches, and I like crickets,
so I want to make that clear.
Crickets are lovely.
You're right.
I should not associate them with credit.
Blow up.
That's completely unfair to cricket.
It's fair to cockroach.
Jamie Dimon made those concrete.
I was getting worried.
I saw all these other ago.
Another entity took a hit
on. There's another entity.
I was like, oh, this is very familiar.
I don't like I don't like how many times
the same company appears
in the headlines, but
we haven't gotten that much since then.
It's not like
there have been five more of those.
I'm just sort of curing it.
Setting aside some of the data center,
the sexy private credit stuff
that everyone's focus on,
do you think over the last several years,
was there some systematically bad
underwriting going on,
especially over the last few years,
or was it
could were there isolated
cockroaches, the first cockroach
before they had a chance to lay eggs
and make babies?
The lonely cockroaches. Yeah, yeah.
So look at again
because there's been so much growth in,
in, in, in lending to, to lower quality,
you know, companies.
And again, the last major cycle
was lending to lower quality, households.
You know,
there there's going to be areas
of, of excess.
And I think, you know,
people are focused on these areas.
But but again, when you look at,
you know, the, the cumulative,
you know, delinquencies and losses.
Yes. They've, they've increased
a bit over the last few years.
But these situations have been relatively,
isolated.
But again, anytime
we've had this much credit expansion,
you're going to have challenges in
these challenges are happening
in a relatively strong economy.
So we don't think
this will be a catastrophe.
The word I've used
is that there's likely going
to be disappointment
in certain areas of the credit markets
that have performed exceptionally
well over the last 10 to 15 years,
but that it shouldn't be viewed
as an overly controversial statement.
That's how markets work.
You know, credit was very cheap
10 or 15 years ago.
High quality bonds were very,
very expensive.
Today, credit spreads are near all time
tight, equities are near all time highs
in value add high quality bonds looks
reasonable relative to their history.
So you know starting valuations tend to be
pretty big drivers of future returns.
If the economy continues to grow.
If stocks keep going up
15% a year, yes these will be,
you know, relatively isolated situations.
But if you get into a period of economic
weakness,
losses will go up
and they'll likely be some disappointment.
I think that's the best way
to categorize it.
And then I think the second
important point, when you look at markets
in a longer term historical context,
is that regulators hate
bailing out the same sectors twice.
Back during
the GFC, it was lending to the consumer.
It was excessive lending from the banks
that caused all of the problems,
almost took down the financial system
and not surprisingly,
the regulations towards the banks
and towards consumer lending was massive.
And today when you look at the world,
the household balance
sheet, certainly middle income
and above cohort groups,
hasn't been stronger
this strong in several decades.
This record amounts of borrower equity
in these areas of the market
have been very, very strong.
From an underwriting perspective,
the areas that escaped the scrutiny
the last time, you know, a lot of lending
to non-financial corporates,
a lot of, you know, this, this,
this mid-market private lending
that came out of that period relatively
unscathed from a regulatory perspective
has grown a lot.
So I think a lot of this
just relates to longer term cycles.
Pimco was talking in a much different way
back in 2005 and 2006,
where we were screaming from the rooftops
saying that, you know,
what was going on was so irrational
that there were major problems ahead.
That's not what we are.
And that's why I sometimes
sound a bit more negative that we are.
I think that the idea of disappointment,
is the way people should think about
some of these areas of the credit markets.
And the good news is
you don't have to accept disappointment.
You can, you know, simply accept the fact
that you had a great performance run
and that by going up in quality,
expanding into a global opportunity set,
that hasn't been sufficiently embraced
just yet, perhaps owning
a little bit of non,
you know, dollar exposure
could get you the same place
with much more resiliency,
much more downside protection
and a lot more liquidity
or flexibility to change your mind
in the in the future as well.
Since you brought up household balance
sheets, can you talk to us a little bit
about your housing outlook?
Because I believe Pimco has been
pretty bullish on mortgages recently.
But at the same time, we've seen a slight
slowdown in the housing market.
But then again, we still have long term
structural, tailwinds
such as a massive
undersupply of homes in the US.
Where do you see that going
in the coming years particularly?
You know, if we were to see
inflationary pressures start to pick up
and those longer end yields start to rise?
Yeah.
So we are very bullish
on housing related investments,
in the United States as well as,
you know, in other areas around the world,
agency guaranteed mortgages,
still trade at very wide spreads.
Relative to corporates.
Even in an absolute sense,
we think it's a very high quality liquid
area of the market.
That, again, makes a lot of sense,
to own across a variety of,
of different mandates.
We also like lending,
in the non-guaranteed area against
the House, simply because borrowers
have record amounts of equity.
Pimco just loves collateral.
That's what it sounds like.
You love collateral?
Yeah, we like the documentation.
And good, good, good collateral.
You know, at least, all else equal.
But, you know, it's not a major
bet on the directionality of homes
when you're lending against,
a household that has 70 percentage points
of of borrower equity,
your home can go down quite a bit
and you're very well protected.
That same dynamic exists,
you know, over in the UK, across Europe,
you know,
and even in other parts of the world.
So you know, again, regulators don't like
bailing out the same sectors twice.
That's pretty good asset
allocation advice.
It's quite straightforward.
But also you know you have much better
fundamentals across household.
But to your specific question around
housing you know it's a tough situation.
We do think that homes are going to remain
elevated from a valuation perspective,
and affordability
is going to remain quite constrained
because there's no easy answer.
You know, you bring the mortgage
rate down, the home price goes up.
You know, affordability
doesn't change in a meaningful sense.
What we really need, in this country
and other parts of the world
are more homes, more housing units.
And again, because of a lot of the,
you know, post global financial crisis
regulation,
it's been real hard to build new homes.
So our base case view is that home
prices are going to moderate here
on a national level.
You could see, at least in real terms,
you know, some steady, declines
over the course of the next several years
in certain markets,
that are a bit overextended,
you know, a bit more volatility.
But we do think that, you know, home
prices are going to remain elevated,
from a historical perspective,
just because of the fact that people
have locked in very,
very low mortgage rates,
30 years, you know, not just 5
or 10 years, you know, which which were,
you know, mortgage durations,
you know, popular pre GFC.
So, you know, you're not going to see,
you know, too much turnover.
And unfortunately
that means that homes for,
you know, a lot of younger Americans
are going to remain out of reach.
But but again
maybe some incremental benefit, maybe,
you know, this administration
get mortgage rates down a bit,
through some creative policy
the next couple of years,
by the way, would like that, given Pimco's
current positioning.
But again, but again,
without without building new homes,
which are going to take,
you know, many, many years,
you know, there's no easy solution.
I want to go back.
You mentioned this idea.
There's there's an optimal amount
of fiscal profligacy
from the perspective of the bond investor.
Maybe you want them to push it
a little bit
because then you could pay a little bit
for taking on, but obviously
you don't want them to push so forth
where you get some fiscal dominance spiral
leading to higher and higher inflation.
You want to find that sweet spot.
You know, I mentioned
we're talking a little bit
about politics earlier
about whether an independent
central bank can be sustained.
But when you look abroad, you know,
it seems like in a lot of pretty major,
we're not the only country that's having
political volatility these days.
People are concerned about, the approach
that the new Japanese PM is going to take.
And so we know that rates are higher
in Japan, France, very indebted country.
They seem to have like a new government
every two weeks.
I like lose track of all the times
their government collapses and so forth.
The UK very indebted country.
The moment anyone takes office,
their approval ratings plunge
to -30 or whatever.
There's a lot going on on the political
front, and that sort of determines
whether countries or even it's
even possible to run.
What might be more responsible
fiscal policies
is that something that, I don't know,
keeps you up at night is the right term,
but is that something
that's a big part of your work
is trying to understand,
especially when you think abroad,
understand the political dynamics
and all these countries
that are happening right now?
Yeah, absolutely.
And, you know, we we get together,
you know, once a year,
you know, talk about the outlook
for economies and markets over
a, you know, five year type timeframe.
And, you know, whenever advisors
I think put it well was that, you know,
we used to live in a world where,
you know, economic outcomes
would drive politics,
if economies were strong,
you know, politicians usually ended up in
a, in a good situation. They
would stay in office.
Today, it feels like it's a bit reversed
where political priorities,
geopolitical tensions,
are driving economics.
And I think you see that to a degree
with tariff policy, you see it,
you know, to a degree
with with various forms of reshoring.
You see it in terms of these populist
tendencies across markets.
So they're all very, very important
and a lot more important
than they were in the past.
And I think it takes a lot of humility
from someone like myself,
and others that grew up, you know, doing,
you know, discounted cash flow analysis
and, you know, derivative pricing,
as opposed to understanding
the political economy.
So, you know,
we think that that's important both
from the perspective
of gaining an edge in markets,
but also understanding that,
sometimes we'll be wrong.
And when you're running the debt levels,
that countries are running
or your deficits in overall debt levels,
there's going to be some unpredictability.
And that's why this idea of,
looking to exploit a global opportunity
set prudent diversification,
targeting some countries outside
the US that aren't running,
you know, 6 or 7% deficits.
And there are high quality
countries out there,
Australia being an example, Germany
being another example.
Even the United Kingdom,
although they have a lot less,
policy flexibility than we do,
given that there were smaller,
you know, open economy with their own
currency offer attractive yields.
So this is less about picking
your favorite country.
From our perspective, it's
more looking to take advantage
of attractive opportunities
around the globe with some tilt towards
those countries
that are balancing their budget and that
do have a better overall fiscal picture.
And we haven't talked about
emerging markets, but there, you know,
a few emerging markets that,
you know,
this cycle got ahead of inflation.
That have been in some sense
more fiscally prudent
than their developed market counterparties
and that have very, very high
yields, even adjusted for inflation rates.
So even some diversification
in some of the higher quality
areas of the emerging markets,
you know, from our perspective, represents
real good value or real good sources of,
diversification in return versus,
some of these assets, you know, here
in the United States that have performed
real well, historically.
But where when you look at,
you know, the likelihood for forward,
performance, just just look a little bit
less interesting.
Actually, this reminds me, thinking
back to 2015, 2015
was actually a big year for Pimco
because it was your first full year
without Bill gross, right.
Who left in late 2014?
That's right.
Can you talk to us,
perhaps how the culture of Pimco
has changed over the past ten years,
and how you would describe that evolution?
Because I imagine it's been a long time.
It must have shifted a little bit.
Yeah.
Look at, you know, the way Bill left
the firm was an ideal, to say the least.
But, you know, Bill left us in,
you know, an incredibly strong position.
You know,
he created a lot of the frameworks
that we still use today to make decisions.
You know, Bill was a strong personality,
but he believed in teamwork,
and believe that investing was,
a team sport, you know, so to speak.
So from that perspective, there didn't
need to be a lot of change
or certainly not radical change.
But, you know, over the this period,
you know, markets have become, you know,
so much more specialized, client needs,
have evolved, you know, over time,
the introduction of a more sizable private
opportunity set,
has been important, technology, big data,
using, you know, trading
techniques, portfolio trading
and other automated,
you know, type, you know, trading
strategies are all critically important.
So, you know,
we're a much more specialized firm today,
which is a function of, again, you know,
evolving client needs, but also just,
you know, the realities of this world
that we live in today
where data is abundant,
much less expensive to access.
So from that perspective,
we've needed to adapt.
We've become, you know, even more global.
So, you know, we tend to, you know,
utilize regional committees and
in regional, decision making structures.
But, you know, a lot stayed the same.
At least in terms of mindset.
And we try to really leverage,
you know, the history and the experience
the firm has had managing and navigating
through more challenging markets.
22 was rough,
you know, for both stocks and bonds.
But, you know, in general,
you know, the environment's
been reasonably forgiving, but
you can always get into these, you know,
you know, tougher periods and, and again,
we, we try to use these structures
that, you know, Bill put in place.
And Bill deserves,
a tremendous amount of credit for it.
Funny, in your last answer there,
there were like five things you said
that could merit full follow ups
or even full follow up
episodes, like about changing
client needs over time, or what happens
when the cost of data goes
from costly to, fairly affordable, etc.
all those sort of interesting things,
but just the my last question
and it sort of relates to technology, you
know, when it comes to AI in investing.
We've talked
a little bit more on the short term,
like high frequency side
and the sort of models that they use
and the signals that they use and,
how that sort of relates
to AI and their application.
But for in a, for a firm like Pimco
and when you're thinking about
longer term holding periods and, you know,
you want to have a good collateral
and good documentation, etc.,
currently today,
have you found ways to apply cutting edge
AI technology to the the, the
the process of good securities selection?
We have, and we're finding ways to utilize
the technology at an accelerated rate.
You know, we do some of this in
some of our, you know, more quant focused
strategies, you know, where we look to use
AI to actually drive alpha.
But just AI is a tool to drive efficiency.
Has been will be, critically important,
to, managing, an investment platform.
Just the ease in which you can access
data, that you can use
AI to help support overall analysis.
Both at the, you know, company level,
the individual investment level.
But even, you know, coming through
economic history and understanding
some of these geopolitical trends
and themes that are hard,
you know, at least intuitively, to grasp,
are going to be critically important.
In fact, before our discussion
today, spent, you know, considerable time,
you know, with our head of technology and,
our head of,
implementation talking about various firm
wide initiatives.
And I the only other point is,
you know, my own use of AI, both at home
and at the office has gone up almost
exponentially over the last year or two.
And I'm the last person you want
to, you know, rely on it
to understand this technology.
It's the younger folks that we hired over
the last year that are helping us
with a lot of this, perspective.
So this is, going to be quite disruptive,
probably productivity
enhancing, you know, at the, at the,
you know, economy wide level.
But it's also going to lead
to considerable disruption.
And it's important that,
we don't get disrupted and that we use
this technology to drive client returns.
But, you know, it's going to be important,
in so many ways.
And we're really, really embracing it
here, here at Pimco.
Dan Ivascyn
thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots
That was a fantastic conversation.
Really appreciate you taking the time.
Thank you guys.
Tracy I thought that was great.
I really I really enjoyed talking to Dan.
Fantastic overview.
Yeah.
So a couple of things stood out to me.
So number one,
the idea of no more free lunch and credit,
although people have been talking
about that for a while now.
And obviously with the rate environment
changing, you can see that argument.
The other thing that I really liked was,
his description of policymakers don't
want to bail out the same thing twice.
Yeah, that's an interesting framework
or way to think about it.
Yeah, absolutely.
And it kind of reminded me of,
there's another person in credit who,
used to tell me, a line
about how he invests,
which is follow the bad guys.
Right.
So, like, the guys that blew up
in one part of the market, usually,
you know, start doing something new,
they're going to get there.
Wait, are you saying they're going
to get their act together?
No, they're going to do something.
Oh, I'm saying move to the new thing.
And then that blows up.
And so if you can just identify
the bad guys and just follow their career
trajectories, just short
everything the bad guys do, I love that.
I love that take, you know, it was really
I had not realized that stat, he said
about how little you got paid for taking
for buying poor credit up until the GFC.
Yeah.
And then post GFC, it's
just totally flipped that you just got.
You should just go as far out on the
credit risk curve as you possibly can.
And you've just walloped, anything safe.
And I knew that, I guess on some level.
But the extreme
of that statistical divergence.
But, you know,
you have to think we had that.
Well, it was more than a hiccup in 2020,
but we did bounce back very fast from it.
So really what we're looking at is,
you know, well over
15 years now of the lines just going up.
And you have to think about
what are the things that accumulate over
that time, are the patterns
that accumulate or the habits, etc..
And this idea that there is a lot of
safety at the far end of the risk curve
and that people don't care,
and that maybe, you know, some of the
the perception that they're safety
at the far end of the risk curve
and how much that's been,
burnished into people is very interesting.
Absolutely.
The other thing he said that I thought was
very poignant was the idea of,
you have all these private credit firms
starting up, right,
and promising these
astonishing returns for investors.
And he made the point that, like,
you can't just say you're going
to make all this money in private credit
because like, those deals might not be out
there and available to you.
You have to do it on a risk
or value adjusted basis.
And as as I say
that, I see, a headline in Bloomberg
about capital Group
getting into private credit as well.
So so this is the thing
like it's a booming market.
There are a lot of competitive pressures,
both on the lender side
and also on the credit rating side.
And you can see people really scrambling
to get into the market
and accumulate as much as they can.
And so the temptation, of course, is to,
you know, accept lower terms,
accept lower quality.
Totally.
All right. Shall we leave it there?
Let's leave it there.
