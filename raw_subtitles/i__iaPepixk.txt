So all this data set of numbers are
weighted towards the end of the decade,
whereas the new solar is right here, right
now, crushing power prices.
So you actually want to be
a little short power
for the next few years
and then flip to being long.
And if you can figure out
when that flip is,
you can make a lot of money
in either the forward power curves
or the natural gas curves.
But as far as your original question,
as I said, data centers,
2 or 3 years to build new power
plants, 4 or 5.
But then you don't need as many new power
plants as everyone's saying.
So constellation CEO said on a call
the other day,
he said he use the Texas market.
He said 87 gigawatt peak market.
You could add ten gigawatts to Texas
tomorrow, which would be the equivalent
of sending every single Nvidia chip
for an entire year to Texas
and running them 24 over seven.
That's ten gigawatts. He was
you could run it right now.
Existing grid, existing plants for all
but 40 50 hours a year.
We stress tested it.
There are some coal plants
that could ramp up capacity factor.
There's plenty of gas plants I can
so I don't know if it's 40 hours,
100 hours, 140 hours,
but it makes more sense
to pay someone else not to run their
chemical company, the refinery company,
for 40 50 hours a year, rather than have
the utilities go out and spend $10 billion
connecting far away wind farms.
That's the argument.
We're sort of come in the middle of it,
but there is plenty of existing capacity
on the grid that could ramp up to meet it.
Hello, and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Tracey Alloway
and I'm Joe Weisenthal. Joe.
Imagine you are a utilities analyst.
Yeah.
And for years you are laboring
in the utility analysis mines.
And you know,
we like talking about utilities.
We talk about energy.
We find pretty much anything interesting.
That's right.
Equal opportunity. Interest people.
We are.
But yes,
you got to say utilities for a while.
Some people would say
it was a little more quiet.
No. That's right.
I mean, for most of our careers,
I think if you were a utilities
analyst, a really big part of your job.
And maybe I'm wrong, but I just didn't.
The popular discourse was like talking
about yield relative to treasuries, right?
They were seen as sort of bond
like instruments, etc.
maybe a little bit of growth,
but roughly viable,
safe haven ish dividend plays like us.
Totally.
And since I know where we're going
with this conversation, one of the themes
of the last few years has been
what I would say is the old industries
that were either stable or cyclical,
becoming secular in the way they grow.
I think that's right.
So what is happening now is if you were,
I don't want to say a lowly
utilities analyst,
but you know maybe a sort of forgotten
utilities analyst outside of your sector.
Suddenly you are very in demand right.
Because all you hear about nowadays
is the
I build out an energy constraints on that.
And so obviously a lot of people want to
look at it from a utilities perspective.
Totally.
I always think like, what a great look
that some people have in their careers.
You know, you could be an analyst
and learn the modeling skills
and all kinds of stuff,
and then you get allocated
and someone gets allocated,
I don't know, farm equipment
and another person gets allocated to
they wind up in utilities in 2022.
And it's like, man,
they're on TV all the time.
My old boss at Business Insider,
Henry Blodget, it's like he was there
is an internet analyst and like the late
90s, what amazing timing and luck.
And so it's like journalism in the air.
It's the same. It's the exact same thing.
I started out covering airlines.
Yeah, of all things,
but those were interesting.
Anyway, I'm glad to say we do
in fact have the perfect guest.
So we're going to be speaking
to a utilities analyst, someone
who happens to have a very contrarian take
on the data center buildout
and how much energy is actually required.
We've been hearing a lot
from people who are very, very bullish
on the data center buildout.
So this will be a useful
I love their point I love it.
Okay, so without further ado,
Andy DeVries, head of Investor
and great credit and head of utilities
and power over at CreditSights.
Thank you so much for coming
on. Odd Lots.
Thank you. The pleasure's mine.
So is a great
to be a utilities analyst right now.
Even better.
Your your Bloomberg News reporter,
Josh Saul wrote an article
about the how much it's changed for bigger
utilities analysts
now with the data centers are here.
But the push back we did have the largest
bankruptcy of all time.
And Enron
oh yeah, the largest LBO of all time.
And TXU, which then went bankrupt and
the largest private equity return ever.
And Calpine, 25 billion,
which exceeds Apollo's lion ELP
trade and Blackstone's Hilton trade.
So we have had a lot of fun along the way.
Have you been a utilities analyst
throughout that entire timeline?
How long have you been doing it?
I started with the first gas bankruptcy
and then I went to the second.
And here we are
with data centers for 25 years. Wow.
So you really have seen it all.
It is
fair to say so. You're absolutely right.
There have been some disasters
and home runs and utilities.
You know, they do get central in the news
obviously with the fires,
that we saw, for example, in California
several years ago and the court trials
about allocation of risk in those,
situations.
You mentioned Enron, etc., but it is also
fair to say that much of the discourse
in day to day has been like
these are sort of bond like instruments.
Absolutely.
Before we get into that, just like,
sort of like
talk to us about what a
what a normal day is like.
And when you're thinking about utility
before, you know, centers.
Yeah.
Pre data centers five years ago
whatever pre data centers
you're looking at a lot of rate cases
okay.
Studying a lot of local news.
You're looking at legislation.
You're reading
you know dry regulatory documents.
And then you're tracking
natural gas prices and start
setting the price of power.
Yeah. Right.
On the federal level, you obviously have
the renewables displacing coal.
And that's, you know, obviously
having a big impact now.
So it's a little
I actually think it's a lot of fun.
My impression was always
the policy aspect of it
seemed kind of the most important thing
to keep track of.
Is that right? Absolutely.
And that's down to the state level,
but also the federal as well.
Yeah, we've done a few energy. Yeah.
So it's still trying to wrap my head
around the sort of patchwork
of, rules that seem to govern our energy,
infrastructure.
But anyway, there's something,
by the way, a little bit like
I'm trying I'm going to try and not say
an offensive word.
Do a Joe, do it.
You should think a little Aspie
about the way, like, you talk to people
in this space and you're like, well,
how is this get priced?
And they're like, well,
are you talking about market or central?
It's like, okay, I don't know.
You know, it's like,
are you talking about a rate board
or are you talking about market prices?
It's so hard anyway, especially in a 40
minute podcast, to try to generalize that.
But I love the people.
Don't get me wrong,
those are my favorite people anyway.
Andy, what is the mood like at the moment
among,
utilities people, analysts, investors?
Wasn't there a conference recently?
Everyone's, gung ho on this.
So the biggest conference of the year
is EEI in November.
And, it was packed.
It was standing room
only for some of these presentations. Wow.
Your competitors at CNBC
were broadcasting from the floor
for the first time.
That probably a sign of a top.
So, yeah, people are very happy in it
just to quantify it.
Utilities have generally grown around 4
or 5, 6% a year,
and then that's moved to 5 to 7% a year.
And now certain names which we'll talk
about later are up to 8% a year.
And that's driven by data center growth.
Talk to us a little bit more about that.
So what is the I mean, I'm like looking
at a chart of the Xiu ETF.
I don't think it's like insane.
But talk to us a little bit about like
maybe quantify the exuberance for us.
So it's like, okay, we
we are no longer just in the business
of measuring bond proxies
and looking at policies, etc..
There was a secular growth driver.
Talk to us about like the bull case,
and then also how we would
see the bull case, sort of like how it's
manifesting into tradable instruments.
Sure.
And you pulled up the graph of the slew.
Obviously, it's still a very interest rate
sensitive sector.
Yeah. That's like dividends.
You can find higher yields and other fixed
income instruments. Yeah. Right.
So you know maybe didn't
do so well last year.
But the industry argues that as this EPS
growth rate goes up to the
high single digits,
mid to high single digits,
that it shouldn't
be as interest rate sensitive.
So that's the big debate going on
with investors right now in this talk.
I mean the Xue has done very well.
So you have gotten both the capital.
It has gone done well.
If you zoom out, it looks pretty good.
It's done well.
That's my impression
of a bitcoin investor, by the way.
Zoom out.
Just zoom.
All right. You've got
and you've gotten that coupon right.
So like you get so
like you might in normal times
just be happy with
the coupon. You're getting coupon.
Plus I mean it worked out.
The fed went zero
interest rates for so long.
So utilities are the place to be.
That's just math.
And then as soon as the fed starts
jacking up rates,
ChatGPT comes on the scene
and all of a sudden there's data centers.
So now all of a sudden
you're taking the leg up on growth
when you don't need to be so interest rate
sensitive. Interesting.
So one of the reasons we wanted to talk to
you is because you have that contrarian
take on the data center built out,
and we wrote it up
in the Odd Lots newsletter,
which everyone should subscribe to.
It got a lot of attention.
Your analysis, interestingly,
is just based on some pretty simple math.
So why don't you, just to start out with,
why don't you walk us through
the calculations that you're actually
making to try to analyze how much capacity
the utilities are taking on
to actually power data centers?
Sure.
So, as you said,
it's pretty simple math here.
So utility.
So data centers
now are consuming around 45GW of power.
And you can switch between capacity
and throughput I'm
going to stick with capacity okay.
So 45GW of power.
And then there's
lots and lots of third party estimates
for where they're going to be in 2030.
And they are centered around this,
you know, 90 95GW.
So you need to add 50 for 2035.
There's a lot fewer estimates.
You come around 160.
Now these estimates,
they you know, they're all over the place
they come from cell side banks.
They come from consultants.
They come from everyone. Benioff has one.
They're I think one of the best out there.
So thank you.
We use them a lot.
So so that's on the demand side.
I'm where you're going
to come out on these.
And then you look at the supply
and everyone talks about the demand right.
Oh yeah.
But then you look at the supply
and all these tech bros
are too cool to actually look
at the supply and do utility analysis.
Right. Who wants to be a utility.
And I'll see.
We're making fun of us before.
But if you look at this
you're fitting you.
But when we realize
are pretty well misplaced
but we're not making fun anyway,
this is great.
So you look at the supply
and these utilities are tracking
all these data centers,
connecting to the grid
because they've got to do a lot of work,
spend a lot of money
in transmission, distribution, new
substations, transformers.
It's a lot of work
but a boost their earnings growth.
So they're happy to talk about this.
And so you look at where they're at
and where they're they see things coming.
And they've got around 140GW of near-term
supply.
Now kudos to the utilities.
They break out with firm committed
signed contracted versus pipeline
behind it because there's a lot of double,
triple quadruple counting.
So if you're going to build a data center
in the southeast, you're going to tell
Duke,
you're going to sell southern, you're
going to sell Dominion,
you're going to build one.
So that's the pipeline potential.
But looking just at the firm committed
whatever
they want to call it, around 140GW.
Now that's you got to adjust that.
So when you connect two data sets peewee.
Yes. When you connect a data center to
the grid, you've got lights,
you've got cooling.
Those third party estimates I gave
you are just for raw compute.
Why did you split those out though?
Because I mean, all data centers are going
to need to be cooled down, right?
What's the point of splitting it out?
I'm not splitting up.
I'm just adjusting it downward because
a third party estimates are just compute.
So you're connecting to the grid.
You're going to ask the lights,
the cooling and everything.
Yeah.
So I want to go apples to apples versus
the third party.
So what do we stand for.
Power usage effectiveness.
Great power usage efficiency.
Keep go.
So they're at 140.
So that power is down
to 110 on apples to apples.
So just to go back you only need 50
on the demand side between now and 2030.
And the utilities
are working at connecting 110.
So the utilities are working on already
connecting
almost as much as you need by 2035.
So again,
just to make sure are on the same page.
Third party estimates
45GW for data centers now going to 95.
That's 50 utilities are working on 110.
They don't give timing for that.
Some of it's going to be past 2030.
What I'm trying to say is there is a lot
of supply of data centers coming.
And it's very unclear
if there's going to be demand for this.
So that's that's the issue there.
And then it might be worth pausing
that and just saying
how we're tracking these things. Yeah.
So what we do for the demand side
is we use the original
AI agent, you know, that is a Gmail alert.
Oh it's the best.
So we anything
that's not on our trade pops,
not on Bloomberg News,
we got picked up by a Gmail alert.
And so then we get all that
in a spreadsheet.
So that's on the demand side.
And then on the supply side we use Diego.
And that's not a large language model.
That's my junior sitting several blocks
west of us right now.
So he tracks all this and utility calls.
Just yesterday NextEra moved
another two gigawatts from the potential
into the committed.
And these utilities
are chomping at the bit
to sign more and more of these deals.
And I think
it's just going to be oversupply.
We're going to overbuild these things.
Just to be clear, the firm commitments,
those are signed agreements
to actually build this capacity.
Yes. Okay.
And so I was talking with the CFO of Oncor
and they made these comments
on their call as well.
They're owned by Sempra.
And I said, you know,
no one really believes these data and
estimates Texas is a walled off market,
as you guys know, 87 gigawatt peak market
that is the one thing I know about
Texas is its own walled off market.
There you go. So 87 gigawatt peak market.
And the demand estimates are
they're going to add 30GW by 2030.
And I said to the CFO of Oncor
said there's just no way.
He said it might not be 30, but it's
going to be closer to 30 than it is zero.
And I said, I just the four power curves
don't reflect that at all.
And he said, then they're mispriced.
So just for the entire market,
just for the benefit of your users,
you cannot trade forward power in Texas
on Interactive Brokers I know that.
Oh, that's a bad audience. It's too bad.
Everyone's like,
look it up then. No, but this is great.
And this gives us a bunch of, technical
questions to get into some already.
Let's just keep talking about Texas.
Explain to us
kind of what the forward power curves are
and how you can back out the implicit,
assumptions that traders
or are making based on those forward
power curves about how much demand
there's going to be sure.
So, I mean, obviously you're going to go
from 87 to you're good at
15 or 30, whatever it is
you'd expect that curve to go higher.
But what's the curve measuring tool okay.
You say there's a forward power.
So the forward power curve
is around the clock peak or off peak.
There's three separate curves.
And the difference between peak and off
peak is actually you know yeah narrowed
because data centers run 24 seven.
So it depends on your north Texas
or south Texas.
And those are in the high 50s.
But what would we be
seeing in the curves for like 20.
Like are there
or is there trading happening at the 2030
10 or 30 might not be so liquid,
but 27 and 28 certainly are there.
But there's an other energy market.
So if you look at nat gas, for instance,
although gas traders are really weird
about the futures curve in gas,
which I don't really understand.
But if you look at that,
you point out that over the longer term
it's downward sloping,
which suggests that there isn't
going to be as much demand,
or maybe there's going
to be more supply out in the future.
I love it.
We're morphing into natural gas
because that is the main driver
of power prices, especially in Texas.
And the forward curve for gas
is much more liquid than it is
for power,
and the forward curve for gas is inverted.
It goes from 370 to 360
by the end of the decade.
So as my energy analyst Charles
Johnson points out,
the bigger driver
there isn't data center demand.
We're at six BCF a day.
There a lot of people are,
but 1012, we can get into that.
But LNG exports were exporting
18 BCF a day.
Now we're going to add another 12.
Like you'd think that curve
would be at least upward sloping by $0.25.
$0.30, by the way, you can trade that
in your Interactive Brokers account.
So that goes
into is there going to be a glut of LNG?
It starts getting outside of my expertise.
But that's
but we heard from a lot of clients
last week when we went on the road
all over New York City.
This is very interesting.
I actually want to ask another question
about the pure power curve.
But since we are on LNG and
then we can get back to the power curve,
just setting aside data centers, etc.
intuitively, you would think that what is
a growth business in the United States?
LNG exports, and in fact,
one of the sort of policy debates
around the whole question
of building out LNG terminals
is it's going to make gas more expensive
for American consumers
because now we're going to be competing
with European buyers.
Whereas when we didn't have LNG export
terminals, we were just swimming in it
because it had nowhere to go,
nowhere to go.
So it's very interesting to hear
that even with everyone acknowledging
a booming domestic demand
and b the expected
expansion of international demand,
their downward sloping gas curve, yes,
maybe, I don't know, maybe the reflecting
world peace in Europe and Russia.
LNG is unacceptable
to the rest of the world.
That could be a driver.
Then they would have to rebuild
that pipeline.
Yeah, but but back to our
original conversation on demand.
The reason I was talking to the Oncor CFO
and asking him about this is he said
he's holding
$2.5 billion of cash collateral postings
from some of that demand.
And he's like, you're not some,
you know, Joe Schmo startup.
I'm going to build a data center
to connect to your grid
if you're posting $2.5 billion.
And he says,
and this is what he said in their earnings
call as well, you know,
that's real demand that is coming.
It's it's material, I'm sure just now
to go back to the power curve,
which I get is much less liquid out there.
But there are trades that happen.
These are price
like how do you infer volume from price.
Because these are prices.
We don't get the volume.
But it's a it's a yearly curve.
And then right for the year starts
it splits in the 12 month curves
and then it goes into weekly.
But what I'm saying is how do you infer
what expected volume in 2028
is going from a price curve?
Sure. It's it's flat.
It goes up a dollar from here to 2030.
Whereas if you're going to add
20% to your good demand
than you'd expect it to go up, okay.
Several dollars.
All right
I see side I'd want to see $0.40, $0.50
I see what you're saying okay with that.
And then just to go back to the fork in
your upper 50s in Texas, low 60s for peak.
And the data center
companies are paying 95.
So Vistra to sit a deal off $95
a megawatt hour okay.
For round the clock.
So Vistra contracted at its Comanche Peak
plant in Texas $95 a megawatt hour.
So Big Tech is paying a very pretty penny.
You can argue some of that for the CO2
free aspect of it,
and some of it's
just to lock in the supply.
So just to go back to the math
and your overall argument, I mean, you're
basically saying that utilities
are already committed to building out,
I guess, twice as much capacity
as is forecast to be needed by 2030.
Yes, the wild card to me
seems to be the demand forecasts.
Right.
And we're already seeing those change
pretty wildly.
I know you mentioned Bloomberg NEF,
but you know, they
they've raised their forecast,
because of the data center buildout.
So they've raised their forecast
of how much energy is actually needed.
How much confidence do you have
in those demand numbers,
and how could they change over time.
Moderate confidence.
But like, look, we're right now
like OpenAI built all the ChatGPT
using two gigawatts,
all the big tech hyperscalers,
they haven't given their 2025 volumes yet.
But if you take their 2024 volumes
and then double it, and this is output.
So I'm going to transfer it
back to capacity.
And you assume a 60% capacity factor.
All the hyperscalers combine around 15GW.
And that's got to be over
half the data center demand.
So to talk about 95GW
I mean it's a staggering number.
And then you get more advances
and you know Nvidia chip efficiency.
Yeah obviously Jevons Paradox kicks in.
You've had numerous
guests talk about that.
It's just a lot of power a lot of power.
Can you just remind us one
gigawatt is enough to power what I like
these comparison million homes.
But it depends if you're in Florida
or the northeast.
But generally speaking,
that's where you're at.
Not only do I find electricity market
so in market structure
and electricity,
very difficult to wrap my head around.
Even after all of these conversations,
I have built no heuristics or intuition
for what
these are gigawatt kilowatt, megawatt
like you say these things and I know
gigawatts bigger than a kilowatt,
but like what is actually me here?
And then the fact that even there
we're talking about the difference
between a gigawatt and a gigawatt hour.
And like, I've yet to develop the sort
of intuitions that I have haven't seen.
Back to the future.
Yeah. 1.1GW. Oh, there you go.
We got a print out,
you know, a little teeny tiny that
like the way we used to do for credit
ratings in the financial crisis.
We need that up there.
And actually credit
ratings are going to be interesting
from a utilities perspective as well.
Can I just ask, you know, obviously
one of the sensitivities in general,
with all things data center and utilities
is this view.
And I think it's kind of overstated.
They're like, oh, or other, is the average
ratepayer going to end up
paying for a lot of, data centers
or we'll raise our electricity bill.
And I understand, like, these are complex
questions and the math isn't so clear.
And also, from what I understand,
the emergence of a data center
can actually lower
the consumer's electricity bill,
because there's just that simple math,
which is if there's more buyers
splitting the cost of the buildout, then
actually your, price tag can go down.
But in the scenario you're laying out
in which there's a bunch of upfront
capital investments and everyone's
very excited to build it out,
and that credit wires and you have to buy
transformers and gear and all this stuff.
If the demand is does not materialize
as expected.
That does sound like conditions in
which we could see consumer rates go up.
Absolutely.
So that's what
we're spending all our time on.
And it's state by state.
And even within the same state,
you've got numerous jurisdictions.
So is it legislatively mandated
or is it done by a rate case
or in the case of northern Indiana,
have the companies themselves data center
companies themselves gotten ahead of it
and said, we're going to put in a solution
where ratepayers are absolutely protected
and get money back.
So you look at NiSource
with the Midwestern utility, they own
Northern Indiana public Service Nipsco,
and they've got a deal
where they've got an inside rate base,
they've got a separate Genco,
so they sell.
And that Genco is doing a deal
with Amazon, and they're going to
kick back
$1 billion over 15 years to ratepayers.
So rather than have a debate
oh is who's funding what.
It's like done.
And you get $67 million a year.
And that's the blueprint.
That's the gold standard. Yeah.
I keep in mind six months
before that, Genco was launched,
nice or sold 20% of Nipsco two Blackstone.
So you could argue Blackstone said,
hey, let's go ahead and do this.
And then the utility right north
of Indiana or northeast Indiana is Ohio.
And the CEO of First Energy
is an ex Blackstone guy.
So maybe they look at doing a Genco
or something like that.
That's pure speculation I have no idea.
PAC gas, Pacific Gas Electric.
They've done a deal
where they've got rates in place
that protect President ratepayers.
Amarin has but a lot of utilities don't.
They don't have these protection.
The point is, someone
if it turns out that there's an overbuild
and there is not as much demand for it,
someone's paying for it.
And it either is going to be the customers
or perhaps utility shareholders.
I mean, you just the political risk
of having mom and pop bail out.
Yeah.
You know, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos,
it's just you can't have that happen.
But again, six months ago this was coming
up on the tail end of conference calls.
And now these utility CEOs
are having in their prepared remarks.
So I'm pretty confident
they're going to figure it out.
You mentioned Blackstone just then.
I do want to talk about
who is currently making a lot of money
from the data center buildout,
but just to stress test
the thesis a little bit more
because it is a contrarian take.
And so I think we should ask
a bunch of questions about it. But
does it take into
account time lags for projects.
So I think, you know,
capacity build out in the energy
sector is notoriously bureaucratic.
That is one thing that Joe and I do
actually know about the sector.
Is it possible that a lot of these
committed projects actually
take much longer to get working
on the ground than currently forecast?
I think the delays will be on building
the new generation, not the data centers.
So data center takes 2 or 3 years,
even if that slips to 4 or 5 years.
The power plants take 6 or 7 years.
And as you know, you can't get a GE
Ivanova gas turbine for years
and years, which is obviously a bullish
backdrop here.
Yeah.
Talk to us more about that element of it
all because building out
if you overshoot on production
then that's a problem in itself.
If you overshoot on production at a time
when it's gotten really expensive
because there's massive inflation
and the, the production,
construction sector,
that's an even greater problem.
Talk to us just about like, per
any given unit of productive capacity
on the utility side,
how much more expensive is it gotten
and what are you forecasting for that?
Sure.
So it's a build
a combined cycle gas plant
ten years ago is 1000 1200 a kW to build.
Then it got to 2000.
Then utility analyst like myself was like,
whoa, that's insane.
Now we're up to 3000.
Then it's like,
who? Who's actually spending this?
But that $3,000 a year for a new gas
plant compares to the data center itself.
The cost $40,000.
So for big Tech to spend another three
to lock in their gas price
or their fuel source,
it's like it's nothing.
Oh, yes.
De minimis, which goes back to
the output for power is 5560
and big tax paying 95
in the grand scheme of things.
So the cost of data center is nothing.
So that's why the utility and I'll, I'll
just jaw dropping on how shocking it is.
Big Tech's willing to pay these amounts.
What about if you don't measure,
production of new plants in dollars,
but new plants in time and again,
if you're talking about.
Okay, well, if we can't get this turbine
and that is several years ago,
we could have got delivered next month,
how much longer are these projects taking?
So if you can figure this out,
I think you're alluding this.
If you figure this out,
you can make a lot of money. Okay.
Because obviously Inflation Reduction
Act had enormous I'm going to vibe code
a thing to figure it out.
Keep going and inflation reduction act
enormous tax credits for renewables.
Yeah.
And then the one big beautiful bill
obviously clip those
if you're not aligned by a certain date.
So all this data set of numbers are
weighted towards the end of the decade.
Whereas the new solar is right here
right now crushing power prices.
So you actually want to be
a little short power
for the next few years
and then flip to being long.
And if you can figure out
when that flip is,
you can make a lot of money,
neither the forward power curves
or the natural gas curves.
But as far as your original question,
as I said, data centers
2 or 3 years to build new power
plants, 4 or 5.
But then you don't need as many new power
plants as everyone's saying.
So constellation CEO said on a call
the other day.
He said he use the Texas market.
He said 87 gigawatt peak market.
You could add ten gigawatts to Texas
tomorrow, which would be the equivalent
of sending every single Nvidia chip
for an entire year to Texas
and running them 24 over seven.
That's ten gigawatts.
He was.
You could run it right
now, existing grid, existing
plants for all but 40 50 hours a year.
We stress tested it.
There are some coal plants
that could ramp up capacity factor.
There's plenty of
gas plants I can so I don't know
if it's 40 hours, 100 hours, 140 hours,
but it makes more sense
to pay someone else not to run their
chemical company, the refinery company,
for 40 50 hours a year, rather than have
the utilities go out and spend
$10 billion connecting faraway wind farms.
That's the argument.
We're sort of come in the middle of it,
but there is plenty of existing capacity
on the grid that could ramp up to meet it
and then of others gas to point it out.
And Abbott's, you know, the peak
demand of the grid is 850GW.
The overall size of the grid is are 1200,
terawatts, and then it gigawatts,
and then you're adding 50GW
a year or solar, and then you're going
to start adding 20GW of gas.
I mean, we're going to handle it.
I'm not really worried about any interests
or anything.
Oh, yeah.
Talk to us about regional transmission
because this is something
that we hear a lot.
It's not necessarily
the power generation that's an issue here.
It's the transmission which the US
you know, seems to struggle with, to put
it mildly.
So there's regional markets myself.
Midwest's the Midcontinent ISO these guys
are tired the most amount of coal.
So I think they're going
to be in the worst shape.
And then Texas and then it depends.
If anyone builds
anything in New England, New
England's got the faraway, more expensive
power prices $70.
The rest of the countries,
you know, I am well aware.
Yes, I have to
because I live in Connecticut.
So if anyone builds a data center in New
England, they're going to be the tightest.
But after that, it's really myself.
No one's building data centers in Vermont
where they occasionally have to switch
over to oil and wood.
Right?
I mean, they iso New England app,
which we all have on our phone, right?
They were getting 40% of their power from,
oil.
Yeah, yeah,
the cold snapped the other day, but now
it's tough to talk about New England power
without talking politics.
And we're not going to go down that.
So, so transmission is very important
because you've got to connect
all these far away renewables to the grid.
You said something that I think
is actually kind of important.
Or is this, narrative meme, you know,
people talk about the I race U.S.
versus China and that one of the things
I've seen people say China is going to win
because they could just build out power
more easily than we can.
It sounds like,
I know you're not an AI analyst,
but it sounds like from your perspective,
we don't know, like what it means
or who's going to win U.S versus China.
But then from your perspective,
power is not going to be the decider here.
Not in China. It's not.
But it does it.
You said like you know, that we could ship
every current with existing capacity.
We could put every Nvidia chip in Texas
today and we could run them for 50 hours
for with the exception of a few
really hot hours in the summer, I,
I like the imagery of all the Nvidia chips
going on a field trip
to Texas, to Texas.
But it sounds like to your view, that
really isn't going to be from the U.S.
perspective,
that won't be the binding constraint.
It's it's going to be a little tight,
but I'm not one of these doomsayers.
Oh, it's the absolute gating factor.
It's all going to stop.
I was in Shenzhen, China, last year,
and a robot got on the one floor
and the elevator went up
and they got off another one.
And I was like, what is going on here?
There's another reason
we wanted to talk to you, aside
from your capacity analysis,
which is one of the interesting things
that's been happening in the credit
market is obviously private
credit has been a big story
for the past few years,
but now private credit is getting in
on the data center buildout as well.
There's sort of, I guess,
getting on your turf
a little bit in the public bond market.
But what sort of activity
have you seen there?
Sure.
So we think that's where the risk is going
to is going to happen.
And frankly, Bloomberg News broke
the story on Pimco, made
$2 billion on day one, loaning
to the metadata center in Louisiana.
So they price $25 billion of that debt
at 220 over treasuries.
And it immediately started trading at 140
and handed Pimco 2 billion.
Great for Pimco,
but then everyone else nice to be Pimco.
Isn't that nice to be Pimco,
especially the weather in Newport Beach,
but everyone else in private credit is
like, oh, these guys just make $2 billion.
We need to start lending to data centers.
And we all know how this ends.
Covenants
start falling, rates start falling.
And again, if you're big tech, who cares
if you overspend like you think AI's
the be all end all.
You're going to overspend
when you get down to the second tier.
The key is the vantages of the world.
And then you get down to sort of the ones
below that and you get like,
you know, the core weaves
and the biases of the world.
And, you know, there's a lot of shorts
going out on Equinox.
And obviously you're getting Jim Chanos
and it's all about the chips.
I'm not going to get into the chip debate,
but it's interesting.
You look at a core.
We've
and they got a $50 billion market cap.
That's a real company.
You're going to be around for a long time.
But the bond market
saying we want a 10% yield to lend you
2030 paper,
you might not be a real company.
And if you look at our supply demand
outlooks, we're kind of
in the camp of the bond market.
But timing, which you mentioned earlier,
Joe, is so key because this data centers,
you're
going to ramp for a couple of years,
and the oversupply is really a 2030 event.
So good luck timing that one.
You said something you talked about
that Pimco met a deal
and this question has come up.
And I still don't think it's
got a totally satisfactory answer to it.
Matt, is a,
you know, very highly
rated company from here,
as you see it, as a credit analyst.
What is it about the private credit?
You know, they'll talk about,
oh, it's flexible, etc.,
but you 220 spread over
treasuries is not nothing at all.
And is that
is their 220 spread really like worth it
for like a little bit more flexibility
etc..
Like what are they paying for exactly
where in the private credit market
that they couldn't get cheaper?
I would think in the public bond market,
I don't know, but I could speculate.
There's a couple.
If the question is
why did you put this off balance sheet?
Yeah. All right.
So you've got the state
of the art data center
with the best Nvidia chips out there.
And you're a tech company and AI is the be
all end all for everything.
Did you kick it off your balance sheet
because you didn't want to damage
your balance sheet.
But the agencies are imputing it.
But maybe quant funds running
their screens, they don't impute that.
So maybe that helps.
Or maybe you didn't want the depreciation
running through your income statement.
Maybe that helps.
Or maybe you want to walk from this thing
in five years.
I don't know, but
one of those is definitely the reasons.
Because why else would you pay
that much bigger spread 150 bips
over their borrowing costs.
But so the key thing is here,
when you talk about that Pimco,
a deal technically this is not meta debt.
It is not.
It's okay.
This is not right. Okay.
So they create a vehicle.
They're not going to okay.
That's a
I think that's an important element
that they're not just arbitrarily paying
a lot more for like a sort of though,
that they're off balance.
And if you read the credit docs,
they've guaranteed this debt.
Yeah.
Even if the data center shuts down.
But our understanding of the docs
is if they sell it,
then the guarantee goes away.
And so that would create a little risk.
But back to my utility roots please.
What happens
if data center shuts down for ratepayers.
And they actually have an explicit
guarantee from meta to protect ratepayers.
So they have that
a lot of other utilities don't.
So a lot of states
Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Texas,
they need to do a better job
protecting the ratepayers.
And by the way,
that's just one line in the doc
that could fall apart way
and other new data centers.
And that's what we spend our time
looking at.
You mentioned the credit ratings
just then.
So the rating agencies,
they they look at the off balance sheet
vehicles, even though it's
not officially part of the companies,
they impute the lease payments.
Okay. And include that as debt.
I see for meta specifically.
They won't do that until the lease starts
when it comes online.
But everyone's doing it.
And then I was just thinking,
I don't mean to labor this analogy too
much, but, you know, you started out
by talking about all the exciting moments
in the history of being a utilities
analyst, and one of those was Enron,
which I assume means, you know, you have
some experience with circular deals.
But what do you think about all the
sort of
incestuous
financing deals that seem to be happening
between all the various players
in the data center, industry?
You mean we'll buy your equity
so you can buy our chips?
Yeah, yeah.
Again, I'm on the side of bondholders
in that one.
Just look at the market caps,
look at the bond yields and the,
I explain what you mean by that for
so like, for people who don't even know
Bloomberg Core, we've got people like me
who have a Bloomberg but are too lazy.
So these names are going out and.
Yeah.
And either OpenAI or Nvidia is going out
and buying equity
in these neo cloud companies.
So then they can go out and either supply
the compute to open AI and buy the chips
from Nvidia. So it's all very circular.
And I think the example people used
20 years ago was Nortel was doing this.
All the vendor financing.
So there's a little lot of skepticism
on that okay.
So we can't do a utilities episode.
I know we've been focused on data centers,
but we can't do a utilities episode
without mentioning nuclear power.
What's it going to take to actually
get, you know, some capacity from nuclear?
Sure.
So obviously the Vogel plant
was the last big nuclear plant
in the line of supposed to cost 14 billion
and ended up costing 32 billion.
It came on line ten years late.
And no utility wants to take that risk.
Now everyone's talking about
these small modular reactors.
And I think that's what you're going
to start seeing is more talk of these.
The only way we think of small modular
reactors goes final investment decision
Fiddy
is if Big Tech agrees to do two things.
They agree to buy some smashers
and they invest equity
in those smaller manufacturers
to give them the CapEx to build,
which sounds like something they would do,
to be honest.
For sure.
And I think that's the only way
you get one of these off the ground.
And I think if those stocks
rally on that deal, they're all shorts
because they're already reflecting
several of those deals happening.
So the big ones are our Nuscale and Oklo.
And Sam Altman of OpenAI,
I used to be the chairman of Oklo.
And then he stepped down
so they could do a deal.
So something along
those lines would happen.
That being said,
Donald Trump has talked about doing work
with Westinghouse and taking equity
ownership to build another Ap1000.
And obviously President Trump
is all about taking equity.
But none of the utilities in my coverage
are going to build something
without some sort of backstop.
We we did an episode recently
with an infrastructure investor and I
you know, I'm a journalist.
I look at the past,
I don't talk about the future.
But I was put on the spot
and I said, I think in the next 20 years,
gun to my head,
we will never have another Vogel
or we're not going to have another project
like that in America.
And it sounds like you agree, I agree.
I do think you see some smears.
Okay.
I mean, frankly, our country's been making
nuclear submarines for 67 years.
That's an SMR right there.
So I think that's the way it happens is
big tech goes in and does that for sure.
In 20 years, we'll have you back on
to see whether or not both of you
this is my only right.
I don't know nothing about the future.
This is my only one call is I just don't
think we're going to ever get that right.
That's
we're not going to get a bunch of those.
That's why I'm with you on that.
And in 20 years,
hopefully, I can dial in from the beach.
All right.
See you in 20 years.
That know probably before because this was
a fantastic this is great conversation.
Thank you so much
for coming on our thoughts.
Thanks for having me Joe.
That was a really fun conversation.
That's super fun.
I love that my the opinion reframing
that I'm sort of coalescing around
is that I can be simultaneously
under hyped and overvalued, right?
And actually throughout history,
that's kind of what we've seen
with transformative technology, right?
Like think about the internet bubble.
The internet changed the world,
but it was a bubble.
Think about railroads.
Railroads in the 1800s changed the world,
but also a bubble.
So I think that's kind of it's
kind of what I think the key issue,
which Andy and you both touched on
is the timing, right?
The timing.
And yeah, I mean,
I think it's a it's very interesting
because of course,
his argument doesn't even,
you know, doesn't
even rest on any valuations right now.
It's like there is all of this expectation
for build out there.
Is it.
You know, as he put it,
there is a number for the amount of,
the volume of data center demand.
There is an amount that's being built up
and it's like the second number
looks bigger, and that's going to be a
that's going to be a problem.
And the time to your point, like
I thought, you know, really interesting
observation you had is a little bit
not tangential to his core idea,
but this idea that some of our energy
policies are encouraging
a lot of production right now,
particularly the expiring solar credits.
Yeah.
At the same time,
a lot of this demand is going to come
online in the back end, etc..
I do think that,
you know, it seems like a really
it definitely seems like a fun space.
It's very far from
when we were just talking about, like,
utilities as, as rate proxy.
Right.
Something for old people to get, income.
Well, the other thing
I was thinking about on the demand side is
I think there's a tendency among AI bulls
via coders such as yourself.
That's right.
To think that demand is just going to go
one way.
Right?
So there's going to be more demand for
AI because I don't know,
every piece of software is going to be
replicated through cloud code or whatever.
And so power demand
is going to go up as well.
But what we've seen so far
is that these things are getting more
and more efficient.
They're definitely getting more
and more efficient
and like faster than anyone expected.
Yeah.
You know, this is a little bit,
tangential to the point, but I do think
like one of the recurring phenomena
is that we're seeing across this,
industry is that every I mean,
and this is,
I guess it's a bull case,
which is that, you know,
even the optimists keep getting,
turned out to be too pessimistic.
The pace of, say, like, efficiency gains
for the cost of processing
a token dropping faster
than people expected this morning.
Recording to this January 28th ASML,
the big chip,
equipment company way
better than expected.
The evals, the benchmarks for the models
where it's like
the optimists say like
maybe it could code at this level by 2027.
Turns out it hits there by like,
you know, early 2026, etc..
So like if you want to
just make I'm not making any case here,
but if you just want to like
make a bull case,
it's like even the optimists,
keep getting surprised to the upside.
On the other hand, it's fascinating
to hear him
say look at what the markets are saying.
They're not pricing
in any of these expectations.
And I was particularly surprised
because I didn't realize this,
that even like, you know,
for all of the talk of LNG export
terminals, etc.,
that gas is expected to be cheaper
a few years,
you know, than it is right now.
Very interesting dissonance
between that and the popular narrative.
Maybe, gas traders just aren't
vibe coders yet.
That's when they would understand
exactly how much more of this.
But we're going to just from
an energy perspective, though,
there is a push and pull factor
here. Right?
So on the one hand everyone could use AI
and demand goes up, but on the other hand,
maybe it gets super, super efficient
and then demand goes down.
I think that's that's the difficulty
or it's just
there is a number
that's out there with like sort of like
some reasonable inferences
about where it's going to go.
And it's very high.
And it was actually very striking
listening to him talk about some of those
super, the Hyperscaler numbers,
because it's like, where does it end up?
Right?
Like as he pointed out, okay,
you like, came out two gigawatts, etc.
like a ton of GPT is out there.
Right.
And that's one of the most computationally
intensive things.
Like maybe there are reasons to think
this is all going to go great.
There's going to be a ton of money
made in AI, but you can't really just like
get to the number.
I don't know, I think he yeah, it was a
this was a very useful
perspective,
just sort of on some of the simple math.
And the math sounds like it's subtraction.
Like this sounds like.
Right. Son is learning.
Well, the other thing I thought was
really interesting
was the response to your question about
why would you finance these things off
balance sheet if you're, you know,
this massive cash rich technology giant?
And the suggestion there was, well,
maybe at some point
in the future,
like five years down the line,
you need to get rid of this liability
or you don't want to deal with it.
This is why we did that episode
with the guy
who has, you know, the company
doing the legal docs, right? Etc.
this is why, it's pretty crucial
to understand some of these things,
because some of the questions
sound like the,
Facebook's
or Meadow's option to walk away.
Right?
There's some call option
implicitly to walk away, etc..
And they, they how they, what they could
what scenarios and what they would
allow it to be do is obviously going
to be pretty crucial for any investors
in this off balance sheet paper.
I did not know
until you asked this whole idea
that, the ratings agency is, well,
they don't look at it as debt.
They do back out a lease cost
and therefore
it can inform their overall,
credit sustainability.
Well, the other thing, you know,
we touched on this,
but there's more and more demand
from investors for data center debt.
Right. Like
the space is getting more for some reason.
The space is getting more competitive.
And so naturally, what you see
in any other credit cycle throughout
history is as demand grows
and people are competing
for deals, the documentation
and the protections tend to different.
Weird, you know,
I find the existence of hype cycles
for debt to be a little bit weird
because I get like,
oh, I really want to get into AI equity,
right?
Because that could 100 x next year, right?
And it's like, oh, I'm really excited
about getting into data center debt
because it might pay me 50 bips more
I find to be very strange or 100 bips
more.
It's like if I have a fixed look, I'm
a simple, simple guy,
but if I have a fixed income allocation,
all I care about is minimizing downside.
And I don't really care
like what sector it is.
I'm not participating in the upside.
You're not going to get greedy.
You're not going to get rich.
You're going to get super rich on like,
I just don't lose my like, for
fixed income. I just don't lose my money.
Fair enough.
