It
 was
 like
 a
 very
 simple
 premise
 when


we
 started.
 It
 was
 like
 tech
 markets
 are


bigger
 than
 ever.
 Companies
 are
 staying


private
 longer
 than
 ever.
 Uh
 and
 as
 a


result
 of
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 the


opportunity
 set
 for
 us
 is
 huge.
 Uh
 I
 was


looking
 at
 it
 last
 night
 and
 I
 think
 I


mean
 it
 kind
 of
 oscillates
 a
 little
 bit


but
 I
 think
 six
 of
 the
 most
 valuable
 I


think
 the
 six
 most
 valuable
 companies


are
 US-based
 tech
 companies.
 It's


definitely
 five
 and
 then
 sometimes
 you


know
 it
 bounces
 around
 on
 number
 six.


Um,
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 it
 bounced


around
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 seven
 or
 eight


of
 the
 top
 10
 are
 US-based
 technology


companies.
 So,
 um,
 you
 know,
 technology


has
 kind
 of
 swallowed
 the
 whole
 market.


Um,
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 think
 increasingly


we'll
 take
 market
 cap,
 uh,
 over
 time.


Um,
 we've
 got
 some
 slides
 showing
 this


whole
 trend
 and,
 you
 know,
 I
 guess
 data


bricks
 was
 an
 appropriate
 way
 to
 kick


off.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 talking
 about
 the


trend
 of
 companies
 staying
 private


longer
 than
 ever.
 That's
 obviously
 a


double-edged
 sword,
 you
 know,
 for
 us.
 um


it
 gives
 us
 an
 opportunity
 to
 invest
 in


companies
 more
 while
 they're
 in
 the


private
 markets,
 but
 we
 also
 are
 very


mindful
 uh
 about
 you
 know
 generating


returns
 and
 and
 DPI.
 And
 then
 you
 know


the
 big
 thing
 that's
 changed
 from
 when


we
 started
 the
 growth
 fund
 is
 just
 is


AI.
 Um
 you
 know
 we've
 got
 some
 slides
 on


it.
 It's
 massively
 expanding
 the
 market.


The
 AI
 companies
 are
 getting
 bigger
 uh


faster
 than
 anything
 we've
 ever
 seen.


The
 investment
 amounts
 are
 are
 bigger


than
 anything
 we've
 ever
 seen.
 Uh
 and
 so


it's
 just
 it
 it it
 looks
 to
 be
 you
 know


a
 huge
 tailwind
 for
 us
 over
 the
 next
 10


or
 so
 years
 um
 you
 know
 as
 we
 as
 we
 look


to
 make
 new
 investments.


So
 let's
 jump
 in
 to
 the
 details.
 So
 AI
 I


mentioned
 this
 already.
 You
 can
 go
 to


the
 uh
 next
 slide.


The
 groundwork
 is
 being
 laid
 um
 in
 a
 way


that's
 very
 different
 than
 previous


cycles.
 Um,
 and
 the
 the
 groundwork


that's
 being
 laid
 is
 bigger
 than


anything
 we've
 ever
 seen
 before.
 So,
 I


I'm
 all
 over
 the
 team.
 I'm
 like,
 this
 is


too
 conservative.
 These
 numbers
 are


going
 to
 end
 up
 way
 bigger.
 Uh,
 because


I
 think
 just
 the
 big
 tech
 companies
 in


their
 latest
 quarter,
 if
 you
 run
 rate


their
 capex
 from
 the
 latest
 quarter,
 um,


I
 think
 it's
 like
 $400
 billion
 of
 annual


capex
 and
 most
 of
 that
 is
 going
 into
 AI,


you
 know,
 AI
 infrastructure
 and
 data


centers.
 And
 so
 um
 you
 know
 what
 that


means
 is
 the
 infrastructure
 is
 going
 to


get
 built
 for
 uh
 all
 of
 the
 training
 and


inference
 needs
 that
 the
 market
 is
 going


to
 need.
 And
 and
 this
 is
 great
 for
 all


the
 companies
 that
 are
 building
 on
 top


of
 this.
 Uh
 the
 best
 part
 about
 this
 is


it's
 mostly
 the
 large
 tech
 companies


that
 are
 bearing
 the
 burden
 of
 the


buildout.
 Um
 and
 so
 you
 you've
 probably


all
 seen
 the
 charts
 of
 like
 capex
 spend


as
 a
 percentage
 of
 their
 overall
 sales.


It
 turns
 out
 they're
 the
 best
 companies,


you
 know,
 probably
 ever
 created.
 Um,
 you


know,
 companies
 like
 Google,
 Facebook,


um,
 you
 know,
 Amazon
 and
 Microsoft,
 and


they
 can
 bear,
 um,
 you
 know,
 potential


capacity
 overbuild
 and
 and
 things
 like


that.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 just
 put
 it
 in
 a


conservative
 view,
 which
 again,
 I
 think


the
 number
 is
 going to
 end
 up
 way
 bigger


than
 this.
 So,
 um,
 so
 the
 buildout's


massive
 and
 this
 bodess
 very
 very
 well


uh,
 for
 uh,
 for
 our
 for
 our
 portfolio


companies
 that
 are
 building
 on
 top
 of


it.


Next
 slide.
 Um,
 at
 the
 same
 time
 this
 is


happening,
 the
 input
 cost
 and
 input


quality
 is
 getting
 remarkably
 better


like
 faster
 than
 Moore's
 law.
 So
 on
 the


left
 hand
 side,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 look


at
 the
 details
 of
 this.
 Just
 trust
 me


when
 I
 tell
 you
 the
 cost
 of
 the
 inputs


um,
 you
 know,
 of
 accessing
 these
 models


has
 declined
 99%
 or
 a
 little
 more
 than


99%
 over
 the
 last
 two
 years.
 So
 you
 know


sort
 of
 100x
 declines
 greater
 than


Moore's
 law
 decrease.
 At
 the
 same
 time


the
 models
 have
 been
 improving
 in
 sort


of
 frontier
 capabilities
 by
 a
 double


factor
 every
 7
 months.
 So
 massive


decline
 in
 the
 input
 cost
 um
 at
 the
 same


time
 that
 the
 quality
 is
 going
 way
 up


and
 this
 bodess
 really
 well
 for
 building


new
 stuff
 and
 new
 capabilities
 uh
 on
 top


of
 AI.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 our
 house


view
 now
 is
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 end
 up


like,
 you
 know,
 electricity
 or
 Wi-Fi.


Like
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 if
 you're


getting
 if
 you're
 accessing,
 you
 know,


electricity
 at
 somebody's
 house,
 you're


not
 like,
 "Hey,
 let
 me
 chip
 in,
 you


know,
 a
 few
 pennies
 for,
 you
 know,


sitting
 in,
 you
 know,
 a
 room
 with
 light


uh
 in
 your
 house."
 And
 I
 think
 it'll
 end


up
 being
 the
 same
 thing
 in
 the
 fullness


of
 time
 with
 with
 uh
 with
 uh
 with
 AI.


Um,
 next
 slide.
 the
 market
 opportunity


for
 AI
 is
 so
 much
 greater
 than
 um
 than


the
 software
 market
 and
 I
 think
 that's


really
 exciting.
 Um,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


previous
 cycle
 that
 we
 went
 through
 of


mobile
 phones
 plus
 cloud
 computing,


the
 big
 story
 behind
 that
 was
 basically


creating
 10
 trillion
 or
 so
 of
 new
 market


value
 uh
 across
 software
 companies,


internet
 companies,
 mega
 cap
 tech


companies
 and
 I
 think
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be


much
 larger
 because
 I
 think
 the
 impact


on
 the
 economy
 is
 going
 to
 be
 much


larger.
 Um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 simple
 math
 that
 we
 have
 on
 the


page
 uh
 US
 software
 spend
 is
 like
 1%
 of


GDP.
 US
 white
 collar
 payroll
 is
 like
 20%


of
 GDP.
 And
 so
 um
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 areas
 where
 I
 think
 we'll
 see
 you


know
 augmentation
 or
 or
 potential
 you


know
 cost
 savings
 or
 efficiencies
 or
 or


replacements
 um
 you
 know
 using


technology.
 There's
 always
 a
 question


when
 these
 things
 happen
 of
 how
 much
 uh


the
 new
 companies
 are
 able
 to
 capture


versus
 the
 end
 customers.
 My
 rule
 of


thumb
 is
 like
 90%
 of
 the
 value
 goes
 to


the
 end
 customers.
 Um
 and
 you
 know
 10%


of
 the
 value
 goes
 to
 the
 companies


serving
 them
 and
 and
 it
 turns
 out
 that


that's
 just
 a
 massive
 amount
 of
 market


cap,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're
 the
 10%
 that


you're
 capturing.
 You
 know,
 the
 examples


I
 always
 give
 are
 like,
 you
 know,
 what


what
 does
 your
 iPhone
 cost?
 Like,
 I


don't know,
 the
 latest
 like
 give
 or
 take


a
 thousand
 bucks.
 Like,
 if
 you
 know,
 gun


to
 your
 head,
 what
 would
 you
 pay
 for
 an


iPhone?
 Like,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're
 if


you're
 on
 the
 higher
 end
 income


spectrum,
 like
 probably
 far
 greater
 than


$1,000.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 the
 difference


between
 that
 and
 the
 $1,000
 you
 pay
 is


is
 the
 surplus.
 And
 it
 turns
 out
 Apple's


still
 a
 really
 great
 business.
 Um
 or
 you


know
 if
 you
 take
 the
 Google
 properties


like
 you
 know
 search
 and
 and
 Gmail
 and


now
 I
 guess
 increasingly
 AI
 stuff
 they


monetize
 you
 per
 year.
 First
 of
 all
 you


get
 it
 for
 free
 which
 is
 massive
 surplus


but
 they're
 only
 monetizing
 you
 per
 year


probably
 like
 200
 bucks
 or
 something


like
 that.
 Um
 and
 there's
 a
 tremendous


amount
 more
 value
 delivered
 um
 you
 know


I
 would
 argue
 than
 that
 per
 user.
 So
 I


think
 the
 big
 story
 is
 going
 to
 be


massive
 new
 surplus
 created.
 A
 ton
 of
 it


gets
 captured
 by
 you
 know
 end
 customers,


end
 users,
 whether
 it's
 businesses
 or


consumers
 and
 a
 massive
 amount
 of
 new


market
 cap
 goes
 to
 companies
 um
 that
 are


uh
 that
 are
 capturing
 that
 opportunity.


If
 you
 uh


>> there
 was
 a
 great
 meme
 the
 other
 day


that
 someone
 said,
 you
 know,
 imagine
 if


Google
 had
 known
 that
 users
 were
 willing


to
 pay,
 you
 know,
 hundred
 200
 bucks
 like


they
 are
 with
 chat
 GPT.
 If
 they
 had


known
 that
 people
 would
 pay
 for
 that


with
 a
 similarly
 magically
 delightful


product
 like
 Google,
 like
 God
 only
 knows


what
 the
 market
 cap
 what
 of
 Google
 would


be
 today.
 Obviously,
 maybe
 even
 more
 of


a
 dominant,
 you
 know,
 market
 share


contributor
 than
 than
 it
 already
 is.
 But


it
 is
 um
 it
 is
 amazing
 when
 you
 think


about
 sort
 of
 the
 reconfiguration
 of
 how


we
 will
 view
 monetization
 in
 this
 new


world.
 And
 before
 we
 go
 even
 further,


David,
 I
 think
 these
 last
 couple
 slides


actually
 set
 up
 probably
 95%
 of
 a
 lot
 of


the
 questions
 around
 the
 market
 because


if
 you
 go
 back
 to
 slide
 uh
 seven,


Mon'nique,
 like
 I
 think
 that
 slide
 is


daunting
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 folks
 in
 part


because
 obviously
 you
 see
 it
 bundled


with
 with
 the
 headlines,
 but
 also


because
 it
 just
 feels
 like
 we've
 all


many
 of
 us
 had
 lived
 through
 the
 early


2000s
 where
 it
 just
 ended
 in
 a
 very
 uh


less
 le
 than
 desirable
 picture.
 So
 maybe


if
 we
 can
 you
 know
 summarize
 what
 what's


your
 case
 for
 why
 it's
 different
 and


then
 particularly
 talk
 about
 the
 timing


cycles
 because
 incidentally
 enough
 you


know
 despite
 the
 massive
 broadband


buildout
 and
 then
 the
 glut
 we
 actually


of
 course
 get
 the
 beneficiary
 of
 that


today
 but


>> well
 we
 grew
 into
 it.
 I
 mean
 we
 ended
 up


growing
 into
 it.
 It
 was
 just
 a
 time
 lag


in
 that
 case
 and
 it
 was
 not
 the


strongest
 companies
 in
 the
 world


building
 that
 out.
 And
 you
 know
 the


thing
 to
 watch
 will
 be
 like
 what
 role


does
 leverage
 play
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I


read
 an
 article
 uh
 this
 weekend
 that
 was


like
 is
 there
 systemic
 risk
 in
 data


center
 buildout
 and
 first
 of
 all
 most
 of


the
 you
 know
 people
 with
 their
 neck
 on


the
 line
 again
 but
 you
 know
 there's
 a


role
 that
 like
 as
 of
 right
 now
 private


capital
 is
 playing
 there's
 a
 role
 and


and
 you
 know
 the
 the
 biggest
 funer
 of


private
 capital
 is
 actually
 banks
 um
 or


private
 debt
 um
 so
 um
 you
 know
 banks
 are


the
 ones
 that
 are
 funding
 the
 private


debt
 companies
 and
 increasingly
 they
 all


have
 insurance
 companies.
 So
 maybe


there's
 insurance
 companies
 that
 are


kind
 of
 backdoor,
 you
 know,
 funding
 this


buildout.
 You
 know,
 that's
 a
 really
 good


sign
 for
 the
 stability
 of
 the
 buildout.


Um
 so,
 you
 know,
 that's
 like
 the
 nature


of
 the
 supply
 side,
 which
 again,
 it


feels
 different
 this
 time
 given,
 you


know,
 who's
 who's
 actually
 doing
 the


buildout
 um
 and
 and
 and
 who
 the
 tenants


are.
 Um
 the
 the
 demand
 side
 is
 the


bigger,
 more
 interesting
 thing.
 Uh,
 so
 I


read
 a
 stat
 yesterday
 um
 that
 the
 time


to
 get
 to
 365
 billion
 searches
 on
 chat


GPT
 was
 2
 years.
 The
 time
 for
 Google
 to


get
 to
 365
 billion
 searches
 was
 11


years.
 So
 it's
 five
 and a
 half
 times


longer.
 So
 the
 big
 story
 on
 the
 demand


side
 for
 me
 this
 time
 around
 is
 AI
 is


built
 on
 the
 back
 of
 the
 internet
 and


cloud
 computing.
 And
 because
 of
 that
 it


sort
 of
 allows
 for
 immediate
 global


distribution.
 Like
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


way
 you
 know
 Google
 and
 Facebook
 started


for
 example
 like
 it
 started
 you
 know


much
 much
 they
 started
 much
 more
 you


know
 like
 small
 build
 both
 had
 like
 a


network
 effect
 dynamic
 which
 just
 takes


longer
 um
 and
 you
 know
 we
 didn't
 have


full
 sort
 of
 internet
 proliferation


across
 five
 you
 know
 five
 and
 a
 half


billion
 people
 in
 the
 world
 and
 you
 know


smartphones
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 everybody


able
 to
 access
 the
 internet
 and
 so
 what


that
 means
 is
 because
 of
 the
 nature
 of


this
 technology
 you
 don't
 have
 to


deliver
 a
 new
 hardware
 product
 and


because
 we
 have
 global
 you
 know
 internet


buildout
 and
 because
 we
 have
 cloud


computing


the
 whole
 world
 can
 access
 this
 and
 so


if
 you
 just
 take
 chat
 GPT
 again
 they
 got


to
 the
 scale
 that
 they're
 at
 five
 and a


half
 times
 faster
 than
 Google
 which
 is


staggering
 um
 but
 you
 know
 there's


probably
 I
 don't
 know
 a
 billion
 you
 know


I
 think
 the
 latest
 they
 said
 there's


more
 than
 a
 billion
 monthly
 active
 users


there's
 probably
 another
 billion
 or
 so


people
 who
 have
 tried
 it
 so
 if
 you
 add


up
 all
 the
 different
 plat
 platforms
 and


a
 bunch
 of
 people
 have
 probably
 tried,


you
 know,
 Google
 products
 and
 Facebook


products.
 It's
 probably
 well
 over
 half


of
 the
 global
 internet
 population
 has


used
 AI
 tools
 already.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,


we
 know
 that
 there's
 probably
 in
 some


shape
 or
 form
 somewhere
 between
 one
 and


a
 half
 and
 two
 billion
 user
 active
 users


of
 these
 products.
 So
 just
 the
 speed
 at


which
 they
 got
 to
 distribution
 is
 unlike


anything
 we've
 seen
 before.
 And
 so
 that


that
 is
 heartening
 to
 me
 that
 the
 supply


buildout
 will
 be
 utilized
 um
 maybe
 in
 a


more
 predictable
 way
 uh
 than
 you
 know


broadband
 uh
 in
 the
 early
 internet


buildout
 days
 uh
 just
 because
 it
 you


know
 it's
 it's
 it's
 built
 on
 the
 back
 of


the
 previous
 infrastructure
 stuff.
 Um


you
 know
 the
 I
 I
 also
 want
 to
 comment
 on


the
 Google
 thing
 you
 said
 which
 is
 like


imagine
 if
 they
 you
 know
 could
 get
 200


bucks
 or
 something
 from
 users.
 The


beauty
 of
 as
 consumers,
 the
 beauty
 of


like
 Google,
 Facebook,
 Apple
 for
 us
 is


there's
 not
 like
 a
 clean
 way
 to
 price


discriminate
 for
 those
 companies
 like


like
 if
 if if
 you
 know
 like
 they
 they


don't
 know
 that
 I'm
 willing
 to
 pay
 more


and
 they
 can't
 charge
 me
 more
 than
 you


know
 the
 other
 user
 uh
 of
 an
 iPhone.
 Um


but
 in
 the
 case
 of
 AI
 because
 of
 the
 way


the
 business
 model
 is
 structured
 and


we've
 already
 seen
 some
 proof
 points
 of


this
 I
 think
 there
 will
 be
 greater


success.
 So
 just
 today
 um
 or
 I
 guess


yesterday
 uh
 technically
 uh
 OpenAI


released
 their
 India
 subscription


product
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 something
 like


three
 or
 four
 bucks
 a
 month.
 That
 makes


total
 sense.
 In
 the
 US
 there
 are


high-end
 subscription
 products
 that
 are


200
 to
 300
 bucks
 a
 month
 that
 are
 like


flying
 off
 the
 shelves
 like
 consumers


can't
 buy
 enough
 of.
 Um,
 and
 so
 to
 me,


the
 real
 story
 of
 the
 growth
 in
 this


market
 is
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 an


evolution
 of
 the
 business
 model
 that


allows
 these
 companies
 to
 address
 the


user
 base
 and
 actually
 price


discriminate,
 I
 think,
 in
 an
 effective


way.
 So
 they
 can
 do
 a
 combination
 of


subscriptions,
 you
 know,
 for
 higherend


users,
 um,
 and
 sort
 of
 get
 to
 the
 point,


you
 know,
 where
 they're
 they're
 willing


to
 pay
 more,
 um,
 and
 then
 also,
 you


know,
 probably
 end
 up
 with
 premium


products
 where
 they
 monetize


through
 some
 form
 of
 advertising.
 It's


it's
 hard
 to
 speculate
 now
 on
 what
 that


would
 look
 like.
 I
 think
 it's
 probably


some
 form
 of
 like
 an
 affiliate
 type


thing.
 Um,
 that
 has
 like
 a
 dirty


connotation
 cuz
 that's
 kind
 of a


backwater
 industry
 in
 today's
 internet,


but
 I
 think
 it
 will
 end
 up
 looking
 like


that.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 um
 I
 think
 the
 way


you
 see
 like
 one
 way
 to
 see
 it
 in
 the


product
 is
 if
 you
 haven't
 done
 this


already
 um
 go
 into
 like
 one
 of
 the
 deep


research
 products
 and
 uh
 sorry
 this
 is


Katherine
 Bole
 calling
 me
 about
 a
 deal
 I


think
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 turn
 this


call
 onto
 silent.
 Um,
 so
 one
 way
 to
 try


this
 out
 in
 the
 product
 is
 like
 go
 into


um
 one
 of
 the
 deep
 research
 products


either,
 you
 know,
 whatever
 OpenAI
 or
 or


Grock
 or
 or
 whatever
 it
 may
 be
 um
 and


have
 it
 do
 like
 a
 really
 sophisticated


shopping
 research
 project
 for
 you
 and
 it


comes
 out
 with
 incredible
 stuff.
 Like
 I


had
 it
 um
 I
 had
 to
 do
 this
 for
 my
 son's


literally
 baseball
 bat
 because
 it


required
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


specifications
 and
 things
 and
 I
 wanted


to
 look
 at
 year-over-year
 like
 you
 know


what
 what's
 the
 what's
 the
 better
 value


and
 all
 these
 things.
 Um
 and
 it
 came


back
 with
 like
 extraordinary
 answers
 and


this
 is
 a
 far
 superior
 you
 know


experience
 than
 research
 like
 typing


into
 Google
 and
 then
 clicking
 around
 and


you
 know
 having
 seven
 sponsored
 links


above
 you
 know
 seeing
 anything
 organic.


So
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 an


opportunity
 for
 them
 to
 monetize
 free


users.
 And
 so
 the
 big
 story,
 you
 know,


in
 the
 case
 of
 OpenAI
 is
 like
 there's,


you
 know,
 whatever
 probably
 30
 to
 40


million
 paying
 users
 today.
 The
 other


platforms
 are
 kind
 of
 a
 rounding
 error


relative
 to
 that.
 So
 maybe
 add
 another


10.
 Um
 so
 there's
 like
 40
 million
 people


paying
 for
 this
 stuff
 today
 um
 at
 some


level
 and
 you
 know
 there's
 probably
 two


billion
 using
 it.
 So
 like
 I
 the
 you
 know


and
 and
 again
 Facebook
 Facebook
 and


Google
 monetize
 their
 properties
 at
 like


you
 know
 for
 US
 users
 call
 it
 between


150
 and
 200
 bucks
 a
 year
 per
 user.
 So


there's
 just
 a
 massive
 amount
 of


opportunity
 uh
 to
 monetize
 and
 on
 the


consumer
 side
 there's
 probably
 going
 to


continue
 to
 be
 tremendous
 surplus.
 I


find
 tremendous
 surplus
 in
 it
 today.
 Um


but
 you
 know
 active
 daily
 active
 users


of
 chat
 GBT
 already
 today
 spend
 like
 30


minutes
 at
 20
 28
 29
 minutes
 a
 day
 on
 the


product
 and
 you
 know
 to
 put
 that
 into


context
 I
 think
 Instagram's
 like
 50


minutes
 a
 day
 and
 you
 know
 Tik
 Tok
 like


sadly
 is
 like
 70
 minutes
 a
 day
 but
 like


this
 is
 like
 real
 time
 spent
 um
 and
 and


and
 real
 sort
 of
 consumer
 value
 already.


So
 I
 I
 just
 think
 I
 know
 the
 question


was
 about
 like
 risk
 on
 the
 supply
 side


and
 the
 infrastructure
 buildout,
 but
 the


usage
 the
 actual
 usage
 and
 distribution


that
 we've
 seen
 this
 time
 around


makes
 me
 think
 that
 it's
 kind
 of


different.
 Like
 we
 we
 have
 a
 really
 good


um
 view
 of
 demand
 signals
 that
 is
 far


that that
 took
 many
 many
 years
 to
 get
 um


you
 know
 in
 the
 case
 of
 you
 know
 the


internet
 uh
 or
 even
 in
 the
 case
 of


mobile
 phones
 just
 because
 you
 know
 you


had
 to
 manufacture
 phones
 and
 convince


people
 to
 buy
 them.
 Uh
 so
 you
 know
 in


that
 way
 it's
 built
 on
 the
 back
 of
 the


previous
 technology
 cycles
 and
 it
 and


that's
 great
 but
 it
 also
 in
 my
 mind


derisks
 um
 the
 sort
 of
 forward
 growth


potential
 of
 the
 of
 the
 AI
 uh
 companies


that
 we're
 investors
 in


>> totally
 pulling
 up
 the
 website
 of
 chatt


and
 and
 doing
 it
 being
 able
 to
 do
 it


accessibly
 and
 almost
 like
 the
 party


trick
 of
 like
 hey
 let
 me
 show
 you
 the


cool
 thing
 that
 I
 just
 did
 like
 that


userability
 obviously
 is
 very
 different


than
 we
 than
 the
 prior
 cycle
 where
 we


literally
 had
 to
 wait
 for
 the


infrastructure
 to
 be
 built.
 that
 and
 the


device
 and
 hardware
 to
 catch
 up
 as
 well.


Our
 our
 early
 stage
 team
 also
 did
 um
 a


great
 post
 on
 this
 topic
 if
 you're


curious
 about
 the
 future
 of
 commerce,


what
 that
 looks
 like
 with
 AI
 and
 even


the
 recent
 if
 you
 uh
 uh
 have
 any
 folks


on
 on
 this
 call
 who
 spent
 time
 on
 the


public
 side.
 You
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 things


uh
 that
 has
 been
 significantly


observable
 is
 uh
 the
 number
 of
 public


companies
 who've
 reported
 a
 decline
 in


um
 referral
 traffic
 and
 engagement.
 um


largely
 because
 you
 know
 with
 Google


search
 now
 they're
 just
 doing
 the


summary
 the
 AI
 summary
 version
 of
 the


result
 flow
 and
 we
 could
 talk
 about
 the


implications
 for
 what
 that
 means
 in


terms
 of
 the
 downstream
 effects
 as
 a


part
 of
 that
 but
 that
 is
 um
 certainly


something
 top
 of
 mind
 we're
 hearing
 a


lot
 about
 from
 uh
 folks
 in
 the
 Fortune


500
 just
 given
 you
 know
 obviously
 this


reorient
 business
 of
 how
 do
 they
 engage


with
 the
 consumer
 when
 you
 could


actually
 do
 a
 really
 detailed
 search
 as


David
 described
 with
 with
 his
 son's


baseball
 bat
 without
 ever
 actually


having
 to
 go
 on
 any
 website
 at
 all.


>> I
 told
 my
 son,
 I'm
 like,
 "You
 have
 no


idea
 how
 much
 research
 I
 did,
 man.


I
 I
 I
 scoured
 the
 end
 of
 the
 internet


for
 you,
 buddy."
 Uh,
 and
 it
 turns
 out


>> all
 dads
 in
 their
 desire
 to
 to
 have


endless
 amounts
 of
 research
 on
 on
 uh,


you
 know,
 kind
 of
 arbitrary
 things
 to


say
 the
 least.
 Uh,


>> here
 I'll
 I'll
 send
 that
 uh
 there
 there


was
 a
 good
 little
 uh
 snippet
 on
 X
 about


some
 of
 that
 Google
 search
 traffic


stuff.
 It
 was
 like
 IA


ruse.


>> Yeah.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 The
 earnings
 call
 that
 that


Martin
 dropped
 the
 other
 day.
 Yeah.
 Just


so
 folks
 could
 see
 like
 again
 it's
 the


folks
 you
 usually
 would
 expect,
 right?


Like
 it's
 folks
 like
 Groupon
 for


example.
 Um
 IA
 uh
 who
 who
 are
 seeing
 the


impact
 in
 in
 real
 time.
 Um
 there's
 one


question
 from
 Chris
 we
 should
 take
 while


we're
 just
 on
 this
 slide
 here.
 Um
 and


I'm
 going
 to
 throw
 in
 another
 one
 that's


related
 to
 it
 around
 the
 the
 shifts
 in


bottlenecks,
 right?
 You
 know,
 right
 now


there's
 obviously
 this
 massive


bottleneck
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 compute,
 but


Chris's
 question
 was,
 is
 there
 enough


energy
 to
 actually
 power
 this
 buildout


as
 well
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 we
 should
 lay


into
 there
 what
 we
 think
 the
 next


bottleneck
 actually
 is
 beyond
 energy
 as


well.


>> Um,
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 like
 as
 of
 right
 now


through
 our
 current
 means
 of
 energy


production,
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 energy
 is
 a


bottleneck
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 we've
 made


investments
 on
 the
 nuclear
 side.
 I'm


quite
 optimistic
 that
 you
 know
 we
 now


have
 um
 you
 know
 like
 an
 embrace
 I
 would


say
 of
 um
 you
 know
 nuclear
 power.
 I


think
 three
 mile
 island's
 going
 to
 get


powered
 back
 up.
 The
 big
 tech
 companies


are
 building
 data
 centers
 near
 you
 know


nuclear
 power
 plants.
 you
 know,
 we
 have


figured
 out
 there
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


natural
 gas
 in
 you
 know,
 places
 like
 uh


West
 Texas
 that
 um
 you
 know,
 can
 be
 you


can
 you
 can
 you
 can
 build
 training
 large


training
 clusters
 like
 very
 near
 to
 them


um
 and
 and
 pretty
 efficiently
 uh
 power


those
 data
 centers.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 we're


going to
 find
 we're
 going
 to
 need,
 you


know,
 different
 uh
 different
 sources,
 I


think,
 is
 the
 short
 answer.
 And,
 you


know,
 we're
 probably
 most
 optimistic


about
 nuclear


>> for
 sure.
 And
 then
 and
 then
 the
 ability


to
 just
 build
 these
 things.
 I
 mean


they're
 like


>> massive
 scale
 operations.
 And
 so
 um
 you


know
 like
 one
 of
 the
 most
 remarkable


things
 and
 we're
 we're
 large
 investors


in
 XAI
 and
 and
 one
 of
 the
 most


remarkable
 things
 about
 what
 XAI
 did
 is


they
 stood
 up
 the
 biggest
 data
 center
 at


the
 time
 in
 you
 know
 like
 a
 quarter
 of


the
 time
 that
 anyone
 else
 had
 done
 the


same
 thing.
 And
 they
 had
 to
 do
 crazy


unnatural
 things
 like,
 you
 know,
 get
 um,


you
 know,
 every
 backup
 generator
 in
 the,


you
 know,
 multi-state
 region,
 uh,
 bought


out
 and
 and,
 you
 know,
 buy
 buy
 labor
 off


of
 different
 projects.
 But,
 uh,
 but
 they


did
 it.
 And
 so,
 just,
 you
 know,
 the


actual
 construction
 and
 build,
 um,
 you


know,
 is
 massive.
 My
 my
 view
 on
 like


chips
 and
 infrastructure
 is
 production


capacity
 of
 those
 will
 typically
 scale


to
 meet
 demand.
 There's
 there's
 always
 a


dislocation
 and,
 you
 know,
 you've
 seen


it.
 Um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 I
 think
 energy


ultimately
 in
 the
 next
 call
 it
 5
 years


will
 probably
 be
 the
 bottleneck
 and


that's
 why
 we're
 so
 excited
 about


nuclear
 and
 making
 investments
 in
 that


area.


>> Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 just
 to


extrapolate
 out
 you
 know
 once
 we
 figure


out
 that
 piece
 which
 inevitably
 you
 know


with
 any
 technology
 you
 always
 do
 uh
 if


then
 the
 bottleneck
 just
 shifts
 to


another.
 The
 big
 component
 that
 I
 I


think
 most
 folks
 have
 not
 yet
 uh


realized
 or
 zone
 in
 on
 is
 is
 the
 cooling


piece.
 Uh
 and
 so
 you'll
 see
 a
 whole
 wave


of
 innovation
 around
 that
 part
 as
 well


once
 you
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 generate
 all


this
 energy,
 how
 to
 actually
 cool
 all


this
 stuff
 down
 without
 boiling
 our


oceans
 and
 and
 uh
 making
 the
 world
 melt


down.
 Um
 so


>> and
 making
 the
 chips
 meltdown


>> and
 making
 the
 chips
 meltdown.
 Yes,


that's
 right.
 There's
 one
 question
 here,


David,
 if
 I
 can
 interject
 uh
 because
 you


are
 the
 business
 model
 snob.
 So
 this
 is


a
 perfect
 question
 for
 you,
 which
 is


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 debate
 on
 whether
 the


gross
 margins
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 AI
 companies


should
 be
 more
 scrutinized,
 i.e.


particularly,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of
 um


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 of
 uh
 turmoil
 around,


for
 example,
 the
 relationship
 between


cursor
 and
 anthropic
 and
 whether
 you


know
 the
 growth
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 companies


might
 be
 actually
 masked
 by
 um
 a


reliance
 on
 some
 of
 these
 models
 and


also
 what
 is
 um
 the
 the
 actual
 unit


economics
 that
 is
 considered


best-in-class.
 maybe
 help
 us
 distill
 how


you
 and
 the
 team
 think
 about
 that
 and


particularly,
 you
 know,
 what
 is
 this
 uh


uh
 topic
 around
 gross
 margins
 where


you're
 willing
 to
 make,
 you
 know,
 some


um
 shortterm
 exceptions
 for
 it
 versus


long-term,
 you
 know,
 hopefully
 benefit


and
 output
 on
 the
 other
 side.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 love
 this
 topic.
 Um
 and
 I
 I
 I


would
 just
 say
 that
 like
 the
 reason
 that


this
 industry
 and
 this
 job
 is
 so
 fun


right
 now
 is
 because
 the
 range
 of


outcomes
 is
 so
 much
 greater
 than
 before.


Like
 the
 variance
 is
 so
 high,
 you
 know.


I
 was
 talking
 to
 the
 team
 at
 the
 offsite


yesterday
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 do
 you


remember
 in
 2000?
 Some
 of
 them
 weren't


in
 the
 industry,
 but
 you
 know,
 the
 ones


that
 were
 in
 the
 industry
 like


>> but
 I
 weren't
 born
 yet
 too.


>> I
 know
 there
 some
 of
 them
 weren't
 born


yet.
 Yeah.
 So
 some
 young
 folks
 who
 are


uh
 very
 AI
 native
 and
 very
 smart.
 Um
 but


um
 you
 know
 like
 late
 cycle
 there's


questions
 that
 you
 are
 trying
 to
 answer


that
 are
 interesting
 but
 they're
 far


less
 interesting.
 So
 you're
 like
 oh
 how


just
 how
 big
 can
 data
 dog
 get
 or
 just


how
 big
 can
 you
 know
 whatever
 pick
 your


pick
 your
 SAS
 app
 like
 how
 big
 can
 it


get
 and
 um
 now
 we
 have
 all
 these


questions
 around
 business
 quality
 um


market
 power
 who
 the
 winners
 are
 going


to
 be
 even
 if
 you
 are
 a
 winner
 is
 there


going
 to
 be
 value
 that
 occurs
 to
 you
 and


where
 you
 are
 in
 the
 stack
 um
 and
 so


just
 the
 range
 of
 outcomes
 is
 is
 so
 much


higher
 and
 I
 think
 if
 we
 do
 a
 good
 job


in
 that
 period
 of
 time
 what
 that
 means


is
 uh
 you
 know
 hopefully
 we
 can
 get
 you


greater
 degree
 of
 variance
 in
 in
 in
 our


own
 outcome
 uh
 you
 know
 as
 investors
 and


so
 I'm
 very
 excited
 about
 that
 um
 so so


yeah
 so
 what
 what
 are
 we
 thinking
 about


in
 business
 model
 so
 one
 uh
 sort
 of


value
 proposition
 to
 the
 customers
 is


the
 number
 one
 thing
 that
 we
 care
 about


like
 is
 their
 customer
 love
 of
 your


product
 and
 is
 that
 love
 enduring
 so
 um


you
 know
 if
 you
 if
 you
 made
 me
 pick
 two


topline
 stats
 to
 look
 at
 uh
 to
 assess


the
 business
 model
 Um
 it
 would
 be
 um


gross
 retention
 rate.
 So
 gross
 because


you
 know
 I
 like
 looking
 at
 we
 have
 we


obviously
 get
 to
 look
 at
 net
 retention


rates
 too
 but
 for
 gross
 retention
 rates


it's
 sort
 of
 like
 are
 people
 getting


value
 out
 of
 your
 product?
 And
 what


gross
 retention
 is
 is
 basically
 if
 you


have
 100
 customers
 um
 you
 know
 in


absolute
 terms
 you
 know
 dollar
 weighted


how
 many
 of
 them
 are
 sticking
 around?


And
 so
 we
 look
 for
 things
 where
 like
 90%


plus
 customers
 are
 sticking
 around.
 Um


and
 hopefully
 they're
 expanding
 their


usage.
 And
 so
 that
 would
 be
 expressed
 in


in
 net
 retention.
 Um
 but
 just
 sort
 of


core
 value
 proposition
 is
 is
 is
 shown
 in


gross
 retention.
 Um
 and
 then
 ease
 of


customer
 acquisition.
 And
 so
 the
 way
 you


see
 that
 is
 like
 organic
 customer


demand,
 you
 know,
 high
 value
 of
 dollars


that
 they're
 willing
 to
 pay
 relative
 to


how
 much
 it
 costs
 to
 acquire
 them
 either


via
 marketing
 or
 sales.
 And
 so
 if
 you


have
 things
 that
 are
 sort
 of
 like
 being


pulled
 off
 the
 shelves
 and
 you
 have
 uh


high
 endurance
 of
 the
 customer


relationship,
 that's
 typically
 like
 the


best
 things
 that
 you
 can
 get
 um
 for
 you


know
 business
 model
 quality
 on
 the
 top


line.
 Um
 you
 mentioned
 gross
 margins.
 So


we
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 gross
 margins
 and


there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 debate
 right
 now


around
 some
 of
 the
 AI
 native
 application


companies
 and
 their
 gross
 margins.
 Um
 I


think
 our
 hypothesis
 and
 hope
 in
 the


market
 is
 if
 there
 are
 multiple
 model


providers
 that
 are
 somewhat
 close
 to
 par


you're
 going
 to
 see
 input
 costs
 go
 down


significantly
 over
 time.
 If
 you
 recall,


you
 know,
 100x
 decline
 in
 the
 input
 cost


over
 the
 course
 of
 two
 years,
 the
 hope


would
 be
 that
 that
 continues.
 And
 I
 all


all
 indications
 suggest
 on
 our
 side
 that


that
 will
 continue
 and
 maybe
 it
 abates
 a


little
 bit,
 but
 it
 will
 continue
 pretty


significantly
 down
 uh
 over
 time
 as
 long


as
 there's
 competition
 at
 the
 model


layer.
 Um
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 coding
 is


one
 of
 the
 areas
 that
 people
 have
 spent


a
 lot
 of
 time
 scrutinizing
 in
 this
 area


and
 and
 and
 sort
 of
 assessing
 the


business,
 you
 know,
 business
 models
 and


business
 quality.
 Um,


I
 I'd
 say
 relative
 to
 like
 mature
 SAS


apps,
 we
 probably
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 more


lenient
 on
 assessing
 a
 company's
 gross


margin
 today
 because
 we
 strongly
 believe


that
 their
 input
 costs
 are
 going
 to
 go


down
 over
 time
 and
 because
 of
 the
 model


improvements,
 they'll
 be
 able
 to
 uh


harness
 better
 models
 and
 deliver
 better


products
 to
 consumers
 over
 time.
 So
 they


won't
 need
 to
 increase
 price,
 but


they'll
 deliver
 a
 lot
 more
 value
 and


stickiness
 um
 while
 their
 input
 costs
 go


down.
 That's
 the
 hypothesis.
 Um
 I
 think


that's
 subject
 to
 there
 being
 multiple


players
 in
 the
 market
 that
 serve,
 you


know,
 models.
 Now,
 we're
 thrilled
 that


GPT5
 is
 out
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 credible


alternative
 and
 it
 will
 put
 pricing


pressure
 uh
 on
 anthropic.
 Google
 is
 also


very
 focused
 with
 their
 Gemini
 models
 on


coding
 and
 we've
 seen
 a
 bunch
 of
 really


good
 improvements
 and
 promising
 progress


out
 of
 them.
 So
 as
 long
 as
 there's


multiple
 players
 in
 the
 market,
 I
 think


you'll
 continue
 to
 see
 costs
 go
 down
 and


again
 in
 light
 of
 that
 relative
 to
 you


know
 sort
 of
 mature
 industry
 type
 SAS


stuff
 or
 infrastructure
 stuff,
 we're
 a


little
 bit
 more
 lenient
 um
 you
 know
 on


assessing
 a
 company's
 gross
 margins


today.
 we
 we
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 invest


in
 a
 bunch
 of
 companies
 with
 zero
 gross


margins
 and
 we
 don't
 do
 that.
 Um
 but
 you


know
 if
 you
 if
 you
 sort
 of
 took
 like


gross
 margins,
 retention
 rates
 and
 sort


of
 like
 ease
 of
 customer
 acquisition


like
 I'
 I'd
 place
 far
 more
 emphasis
 on


making
 sure
 that
 we
 feel
 like
 there's


greatness
 in
 those
 latter
 two.
 Um
 and


you
 know
 give
 them
 a
 little
 bit
 more


benefit
 of
 the
 doubt
 that
 they
 can


improve
 uh
 on
 on
 the
 first.


>> For
 sure.
 Yeah.
 I
 flip
 back
 to
 this


because
 I
 I
 I
 I've
 seen
 this
 personally


myself
 like
 a
 dozen
 plus
 times,
 but
 but


something
 you
 said
 there
 really
 just


clicked
 for
 me,
 which
 is
 to
 say
 like,


you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 try
 to
 make


comparisons
 to
 the
 dot
 era
 and
 they're


like,
 oh
 remember
 we
 measured
 eyeballs


as
 well,
 right?
 Like
 isn't
 that
 the
 akin


to
 in
 terms
 of
 retention
 or
 usage
 and


it's
 like
 yes
 and
 no.
 this
 is
 reaching


such
 an
 inmass
 so
 quickly
 because
 of
 all


the
 reasons
 you
 alluded
 to
 earlier
 David


in
 terms
 of
 ability
 to
 just
 pull
 up
 a


website
 and
 actually
 try
 it
 but
 also


people
 are
 paying
 for
 this
 and
 it's
 an


interesting
 juxaposition
 when
 you
 think


about
 the
 last
 cycle
 of
 things
 we
 paid


for
 so
 to
 speak
 like
 a
 Spotify
 you
 know


subscription
 or
 a
 Netflix
 subscription


where
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 know
 obviously


pressures
 come
 from
 from
 a
 budget


standpoint
 those
 are
 first
 to
 go
 but


this
 you'd
 probably
 sacrifice
 a
 few


things
 just
 given
 how
 much
 of
 an
 impact


it
 has
 made
 either
 professionally
 for


you
 personally
 and
 accelerated
 your


productivity
 and
 and
 hopefully
 time
 in


terms
 of
 of
 acceleration
 as
 a
 part
 of


that.
 Um


there


>> Thomas's
 question
 I'm
 happy
 to
 take


Thomas's
 question.


>> It's
 from
 this
 is
 from
 Thomas.
 So
 it


seems
 like
 there's
 downward
 pressure
 on


the
 likes
 of
 Open
 AI
 on
 consumer
 pricing


yet
 the
 cash
 burn
 of
 open
 AI
 is
 ramping


up
 to
 levels
 not
 seen
 before
 previously.


You
 know
 reports
 of
 a
 billion
 dollars


plus
 per
 month.
 How
 does
 a
 cash
 burn


moderate
 in
 the
 future
 relative
 to
 what


you
 think
 in
 your
 opinion?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 um,
 so
 yeah.
 So,
 so
 what
 I
 was


saying
 is
 like
 I
 think
 effectively
 like


there's
 greater
 consumer
 stickiness
 than


you
 would
 think
 and
 there
 have
 been
 a


tremendous
 amount
 of
 free
 alternatives


thrown
 at
 consumers
 over
 the
 last
 12


months
 and
 it
 hasn't
 had
 any
 impact
 on


their
 business.
 Now,
 that
 could
 change


over
 time.
 uh
 but
 so
 far
 what
 we've
 seen


is
 is
 no
 effect
 that
 creates
 price


pressure
 and
 if
 you
 think
 about
 what
 I


had
 described
 earlier
 which
 is
 like
 call


it
 a
 billion
 people
 using
 it
 and
 only
 30


million
 people
 paying
 for
 it
 I
 think


there's
 way
 more
 upside
 to
 monetize
 the


base
 than
 there
 is
 risk
 of
 price


pressure
 uh
 on
 you
 know
 today's
 30


million
 people
 paying
 for
 it
 um
 and
 so


uh
 so
 I
 think
 there
 will
 end
 up
 being


like
 if
 it's
 a
 a
 P
 time
 Q
 and
 this
 is


you
 know
 we're
 talking
 about
 chatb
 I


would
 say
 it
 probably
 applies
 to,
 you


know,
 most
 of the
 consumerf
 facing
 stuff


in
 the
 industry.
 If
 there's
 a
 P
 time
 Q,


which
 is
 like
 price
 times
 quantity,


which
 is
 the
 really
 simple
 way
 to
 think


about
 these
 consumer
 internet


businesses,


Q
 is
 like
 at
 this
 point,
 they've
 gotten


so
 big
 on
 the
 on
 the
 monthly
 active


users,
 like
 over
 the
 course
 of
 the
 next


5
 years,
 like
 maybe
 it
 gets
 to
 two


billion
 or
 something.
 I
 don't
 know.
 But


like
 the
 Google
 and
 Facebook
 properties


are
 in
 the
 twos,
 billions.
 So
 there's


you
 it
 only
 gets
 so
 large.
 Um,
 but
 I


think
 there's
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of


room
 to
 run
 actually
 on
 the
 upside
 on


the
 P
 uh
 on
 the
 price.
 So,
 so
 again,
 if


you
 think
 about,
 you
 know,
 how
 are
 they


monetizing
 today,
 you
 know,
 it's
 30


million
 people
 out
 of
 a
 billion
 um,
 you


know,
 at
 a
 a
 modest
 subscription
 that
 is


not
 really
 reflective
 of
 like
 real
 price


discrimination
 yet.
 So,
 I
 suspect
 the
 P


is
 probably
 like
 a
 thing
 that
 we
 get


surprised
 on
 the
 upside
 by.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 I
 think
 about
 like
 lessons


learned
 from
 previous
 internet
 era


companies
 and
 I
 remember
 looking
 at


internet
 companies
 10
 years
 ago
 and
 we


would
 we
 would
 always
 look
 at
 like


Facebook
 and
 Google
 and
 we're
 like,


"Okay,
 Facebook
 and
 Google,
 they're


monetizing
 their
 users
 at
 X,
 like
 that's


the
 max
 we
 could
 get
 to."
 Um,
 and
 the


big
 story
 about
 what's
 happened
 over
 the


last
 10
 years
 is
 they've
 like
 8xed
 their


own
 monetization
 of
 their
 users.
 And
 so


I
 I
 I
 suspect
 that
 if
 they,
 you
 know,


have
 some
 uh
 thoughtful
 ways
 of


monetizing
 free
 usage
 while
 while
 still


maintaining
 trust,
 there's
 probably
 more


upside
 than
 downside
 uh
 on
 on
 pricing
 uh


to
 to
 Thomas's
 question.
 And
 then
 on
 the


burn
 um
 the
 the
 actual
 like
 most
 of
 the


burn
 comes
 from
 re
 like
 research
 like


R&D
 you
 know
 and
 so
 f
 future
 investments


um
 and
 you
 know
 we
 could
 apply
 this
 to


the
 whole
 industry
 of
 all
 the
 model


companies
 um
 but
 we
 could
 you
 know
 we


could
 talk
 if
 if
 it's
 specifically
 open


AI
 I'm
 happy
 to
 address
 that
 one
 but
 on


the
 open
 AI
 side
 um
 I
 think
 they're
 in


an
 advantaged
 position
 because
 they
 have


the
 consumer
 base
 and
 that's
 stickier.


Like
 my
 family
 like
 my
 parents
 in


Kentucky
 you
 use
 chat
 GPT
 like
 if


there's
 some
 better
 slightly
 better


model
 that
 comes
 out
 like
 they're
 not


going to
 switch.
 Um
 and
 so
 I
 think


that's
 pretty
 durable.
 Um
 and
 so
 it's


probably
 better
 a
 better
 position
 to
 be


in
 um
 to
 fund
 those
 research
 efforts
 for


continued
 model
 development.
 Um
 you
 know


there
 used
 to
 be
 like
 a
 thing
 which
 was


you
 know
 enterprise
 companies
 are


stickier
 than
 consumer
 companies.
 Um
 in


this
 case
 they're
 developer
 comp
 like


these
 are
 like
 developers
 buying
 these


things
 uh
 on
 the
 B2B
 side
 for
 the
 most


part
 today
 like
 buying
 kind
 of
 you
 know


raw
 access
 to
 the
 models
 and
 that's
 not


very
 sticky
 uh
 yet.
 I
 think
 it
 it's


possible
 that
 it
 does
 get
 sticky
 over


time
 um
 but
 as
 of
 right
 now
 it's
 not


very
 sticky.
 So
 to
 the
 point
 about


coding
 models,
 you
 know,
 if
 there's
 a


new
 coding
 model
 that
 comes
 along
 that's


better
 than
 the
 latest
 version
 from


Enthropic,
 like
 our
 coding
 companies


will
 just
 switch
 and
 it's
 pretty
 easy
 to


do
 because
 it's
 an
 API
 call.
 And
 so
 um


so
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 interestingly


enough,
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 different
 this


time
 where
 the
 consumer
 is
 a
 little


stickier.
 I
 think
 that
 gives
 you
 an


advantage
 and
 I
 think
 the
 companies
 will


not
 irrationally
 spend
 on
 new
 model


development
 if
 there's
 not
 a
 financial


return.
 Uh
 I
 would
 say
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 we've
 observed
 over
 the
 last
 now


almost
 five
 years
 of
 spending
 time
 with


these
 companies
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 founders


started
 as
 like
 research
 brain
 AI
 people


that
 were
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 there's


going
 to
 be
 no
 economy
 and
 like


everything's
 going
 to
 end
 because
 we're


going to
 have
 AGI
 and
 it's
 like
 and
 then


you
 know what
 like
 has
 happened
 like


competitive
 forces
 have
 kicked
 in
 and


they've
 become
 like
 hard
 capitalists
 and


so
 you
 know
 my
 my
 expectation
 and
 from


conversations
 with
 them
 you
 know
 on
 an


ongoing
 basis
 is
 you
 know
 they're
 not


going
 to
 do
 totally
 irrational
 things
 on


the
 research
 side
 if
 there's
 not
 going


to
 be
 a
 financial
 payback
 for
 them.


>> So
 can
 DG
 also
 comment
 on
 durability
 of


revenue
 for
 many
 of
 the
 AI
 applications


built
 on
 LLMs
 i.e.
 outside
 of
 open
 AI


anthropic
 xai.


>> Yeah.
 Um


it
 depends
 on
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 use.
 So


I
 think
 some
 of
 them
 are
 really
 sticky.


Um,
 so
 you
 know,
 companies,
 you
 know,


like
 medical
 scribe
 stuff
 I
 think
 is


pretty
 sticky,
 uh,
 because
 there's
 a


bunch
 of
 doctor
 workflow
 built
 around


it.
 Um,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 customer
 support
 I


think
 is
 pretty
 sticky.
 Some
 of
 like
 the


high-end
 financial
 analysis
 type
 stuff
 I


think
 is
 pretty
 sticky.
 Um,


>> can
 you
 explain
 why
 those
 spec
 specific


areas
 you
 think
 are
 more
 stickier
 than


others?
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 the
 more
 stuff


that
 gets
 integrated
 and
 the
 more


company
 specific
 uh
 like
 kind
 of
 rules


built
 around
 the
 model
 stuff
 you
 have


the
 stickier
 it's
 going
 to
 be.
 Um
 and
 so


you
 know
 I
 think
 stickiness
 comes
 in
 the


form
 like
 in
 software
 in
 in
 applications


like
 the
 same
 way
 it's
 kind
 of
 always


come
 with
 software.
 Uh
 I'm
 sure
 one
 of


my
 early
 stage
 partners
 has
 written
 a


blog
 post
 about
 it
 because
 we
 talk
 about


it
 all
 the
 time.
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 it's


stuff
 like
 integrations


uh
 you
 know
 rules
 engines
 workflows


um
 you
 know
 stuff
 like
 that
 inter
 you


know
 sort
 of
 enterprise
 capabilities
 so


like
 I
 think


>> like
 a
 customer
 for
 example


the
 rules
 to
 go
 down
 the
 sequencing
 of


how
 to
 troubleshoot
 are
 so
 embedded
 that


you
 probably
 wouldn't
 experiment
 a
 ton


once
 you've
 got
 a
 workflow
 you
 know


across
 multiple
 different
 scenarios
 that


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 or
 and
 even
 like
 a
 style


with
 which
 something
 engages
 like
 these


like
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 companies
 that
 are
 in


customers
 of
 these
 things
 are
 like


brands
 and
 they
 care
 about
 the
 way
 that


you
 know
 like
 the
 um
 the
 customer


support
 agent
 interacts
 and
 so
 um
 so
 I


think
 that
 stuff's
 probably
 pretty


sticky.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff


that's
 not
 sticky
 at
 all.
 Um,
 so
 some
 of


the
 emergent
 behavior
 that's
 like
 um,


you
 know,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 talk
 negative


about
 anything.
 Um,
 but
 like
 some
 of
 the


stuff
 that's
 like
 not
 as
 sticky
 is
 like


experimental
 usage
 of
 tools
 to
 build
 um,


you
 know,
 some
 of
 the
 internal
 tooling


software
 replacements
 or
 like
 very


low-end
 prototyping
 of
 websites
 and


things
 like
 that.
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 like


TBD,
 you
 know,
 who
 the
 players
 are
 and


what
 the
 use
 cases
 are.
 And
 I
 think
 I


think
 the
 market
 for
 that
 will
 probably


segment
 out
 like
 we're
 already
 seeing
 it


some
 where
 some
 of
 the
 tools
 are
 just


being
 kind
 of
 used
 for
 prototyping
 and


then
 some
 of
 the
 cool
 tools
 are
 being


used
 to
 like
 actually
 build
 and
 deploy


apps.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 you'll
 see
 you
 know


kind
 of
 continued
 bifurcation
 of
 those


things.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 it's
 so
 early.


Um
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 like
 companies
 are


going
 to
 vibe
 code
 up
 like
 their


Salesforce.com.
 It's
 just
 not
 worth
 it.


like
 it's
 not
 like
 core
 competencies.
 I


hope
 they
 would.
 I
 I
 wish
 we
 could
 vibe


code
 away
 our
 Salesforce.com.


>> Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to
 speedrun
 through
 some


of
 these
 questions
 because
 I
 I
 recognize


we've
 uh
 opened
 the
 floodgates
 on
 them


and
 I
 want
 to
 make sure
 we
 get
 through


as
 many
 as
 possible.
 So,
 Alberto
 um


asked,
 "Given
 the
 speed
 of
 go
 to
 market


for
 AI
 companies,
 do
 you
 think
 100


million
 AR
 is
 the
 right
 milestone
 to


measure
 against
 or
 are
 you
 starting
 to


move
 the
 goalpost
 on
 on
 what
 success
 is


there?"


Yeah,
 it's
 so
 funny
 like
 you
 know
 the
 it


used
 to
 be
 uh
 I
 can't
 even
 remember
 one


of
 the
 one
 of
 the
 VCs
 coined
 the
 term


you
 know
 like
 triple
 triple
 double


double
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and
 it's


like
 that
 looks
 like
 very
 modest.


>> Yeah,


>> something
 like
 that.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 that


that
 time
 compression
 has
 like
 massively


gone
 down.
 Um
 so
 I
 I
 I
 gotta
 look
 up
 the


stat.
 We
 we
 uh
 we
 ran
 the
 analysis
 on
 it


recently,
 but
 it
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 the


top
 companies
 that
 we've
 seen
 um
 you


know,
 have
 gotten
 to
 10
 million,
 then


100
 million
 like
 four
 times
 faster
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Um
 for
 us,
 you


know,
 it's
 really
 important
 that
 we
 have


market
 context
 and
 like
 real
 time
 market


context
 to
 make
 judgments
 about
 what


great
 looks
 like.
 And
 so
 I
 don't
 have
 an


absolute
 answer
 for
 you,
 but
 if
 you
 were


to
 sit
 there
 and
 look
 at
 and
 like
 and


listen
 to
 one
 of
 our
 investment


discussions,
 um
 we
 are
 we
 are
 comparing


like
 the
 growth
 of
 you
 know
 XYZ
 new
 app


to
 like
 cursor
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 nothing


looks
 like
 cursor
 so
 it's
 unfair
 but


like
 cursor
 and
 decagon
 and
 a
 bridge
 and


11
 labs
 uh
 you
 know
 and
 not
 like
 Shopify


and
 docuine
 and
 you
 know
 those


companies.
 So
 um
 you
 know
 if
 you're
 not


like
 fully
 in
 the
 market
 and
 seeing


everything
 and
 meeting
 all
 the
 companies


you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 that


context
 to
 assess
 what
 grade
 is
 at
 any


given
 time


>> for
 sure.
 Um
 for
 AI
 companies
 what
 do


you
 this
 is
 a
 good
 question
 from
 a
 deep


gap.
 um
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about


seatbased
 pricing
 versus
 usage
 base
 and


and
 what
 are
 the
 experiments
 that
 uh


some
 of
 the
 startups
 you've
 seen
 do
 well


around
 configuring
 pricing
 in
 this
 age


of
 AI?


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 like
 the
 the
 big
 question.


Uh,
 I
 I
 love
 this
 question
 cuz
 like
 I
 I


feel
 like
 on
 X
 and
 like
 other
 blogs,


people
 have
 written
 all
 these
 like


really
 long
 posts
 about,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 new
 prices
 that
 are
 going
 to
 happen


and
 with
 AI
 and
 like
 it's
 a
 to
 me
 it's


like
 a
 little
 hand
 wavy
 like
 one,
 it's


subject
 to
 um,
 you
 know,
 innovations
 in


the
 technology
 side
 and
 the
 products


getting
 better.
 Um,
 and
 then
 two,
 we've


really
 only
 seen
 a
 true
 business
 model


innovation
 like
 early
 early
 days
 in
 one


area.
 um
 uh
 and
 that's
 customer
 support


it
 because
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 like


definitively
 resolve
 a
 task.
 So
 even


even
 with
 that
 like
 it's
 hard
 to
 do
 and


so
 you
 know
 the
 the
 the
 question
 maybe


to
 reframe
 it
 would
 be
 like
 we
 had


actually
 we
 had
 like
 licenses
 right
 like


you
 know
 perpetual
 licenses
 with


maintenance
 and
 then
 we
 switched
 to
 SAS


and
 that
 was
 mostly
 seatbased
 and
 that


was
 huge
 innovation
 very
 disruptive
 that


was
 a
 huge
 enabler
 of
 the
 startups


actually
 going
 to
 beat
 the
 incumbent


software
 companies
 uh
 because
 it
 was
 so


disruptive
 at
 the
 time
 then
 we
 got
 to


usage
 based
 and
 so
 you
 Obviously
 all
 the


cloud
 companies
 uh
 run
 that
 way.
 Um
 you


know
 data
 bricks
 runs
 that
 way,


Snowflake
 etc.
 Um
 and
 then
 the
 hope


would
 be
 that
 I've
 seen
 you
 know
 and
 and


and
 heard
 about
 is
 like
 with
 AI
 can
 you


just
 monetize
 the
 replacement
 of
 tasks


humans
 do.
 Um
 and
 so
 when
 I
 talked
 about


the
 customer
 support
 piece
 like
 that's


the
 furthest
 along
 in
 the
 monetizing
 the


tasks
 that
 humans
 do.
 Um,
 but
 that's


super
 super
 early
 in
 all
 the
 other


areas.
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 early
 like


end
 customers
 want
 to
 buy
 stuff
 on
 seat


and
 consumption
 based
 pricing.
 Um,
 and


you
 know,
 you
 kind
 of
 got
 to
 meet
 the


market
 where
 it
 is.
 So,
 um,
 for
 now


we're
 not
 seeing
 hugely
 disruptive


things.
 I
 think
 as
 the
 capabilities
 get


much
 better
 um
 and
 sort
 of
 measurability


of
 the
 task
 completions
 gets
 more


objective
 perhaps
 maybe
 we
 get
 there
 but


I
 would
 say
 it's
 like
 super
 early
 days


and
 I'm
 low
 conviction
 that
 we
 end
 up


you
 know
 five
 years
 from
 now
 with
 all


the
 software
 companies
 monetizing
 in
 a


completely
 different
 way.


>> Absolutely.
 Um,
 I've


>> by
 the
 way,
 sorry,
 this
 is
 one
 more


thing.


>> This
 also
 goes
 to
 my
 point
 that
 I
 made


earlier
 about
 surplus.
 Like,
 it's
 going


to
 be
 really
 hard
 to
 capture
 that


surplus
 unless
 you
 can
 monetize
 based
 on


the
 value
 of
 the
 completed
 task.
 But


because
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 hard


to
 measure
 and
 there's
 going
 to
 be


competition
 in
 the
 market,
 I
 suspect


that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 surplus
 or
 savings
 may


end
 up
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 the
 customer.


Again,
 you
 could
 probably
 still
 build


really
 interesting,
 good
 companies
 that


have
 really
 high
 market
 cap.
 Um
 but
 that


is
 like
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 directly


related
 to
 who
 captures
 uh
 the
 value
 and


the
 surplus
 like
 like
 the
 I
 always
 say


like
 the
 steam
 engine
 got
 invented
 and


like
 you
 didn't
 price
 the
 like
 the
 steam


engine
 didn't
 get
 priced
 based
 on
 like


the
 calculation
 of
 how
 many
 you
 know


humans
 it
 replaced
 in
 doing
 a
 specific


task.
 uh
 competitive
 forces
 kicked
 in


and
 you
 know
 it
 was
 priced
 at
 some
 like


appropriate
 you
 know
 competitive
 level


with
 a
 return
 on
 capital
 um
 while
 still


like
 capturing
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 but


delivering
 much
 more
 value
 to
 the
 end


customers
 or
 the
 users
 of
 of
 the
 steam


engine
 and
 I
 think
 the
 same
 will
 happen


here


>> for
 sure
 actually
 it's
 a
 good
 um


transition
 for
 us
 to
 actually
 uh
 talk


about
 what
 this
 all
 means
 for
 growth
 um


given
 this
 setup


>> I
 I
 I
 try
 and
 sit
 in
 on
 as
 many
 pitches


in
 our
 early
 stage
 practice
 as
 I
 can


just
 because
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 learn
 a
 lot


about
 you
 know
 what's
 starting
 what
 what


are
 interesting
 founders
 starting
 to


hone
 in
 on
 and
 you
 know
 in
 what
 areas


are
 they
 building
 um
 and
 our
 early
 stage


team
 is
 doing
 a
 great
 job
 of
 uh
 you
 know


doing
 the
 most
 exciting
 early
 stage


deals.
 So
 that
 to
 me
 just
 bodess
 really


well
 for
 the
 next
 12
 to
 24
 months
 of
 of


deal
 activity
 for
 us.
 um
 you
 know


looking
 out.


All
 right,
 growth
 partner.
 So
 this
 is
 a


this
 is
 a
 crazy
 looking
 chart.
 I
 mean


it's
 not
 surprising
 because
 it
 it
 was


like
 the
 first
 thing
 we
 talked
 about


which
 is
 you
 know
 tech
 markets
 are
 big


and
 of
 course
 companies
 are
 staying


private
 uh
 longer
 but
 um
 but
 you
 can
 see


it
 in
 the
 chart
 here.
 It
 used
 to
 be
 that


companies
 uh
 would
 go
 public
 you
 know


within
 the
 call
 it
 like
 5
 to
 10
 year


window
 of
 of
 inception
 and
 despite
 the


fact
 that
 the
 companies
 are
 growing
 much


faster
 and
 getting
 better
 quicker


they're
 staying
 private
 way
 longer.
 So


um
 you
 know
 all
 all
 is
 that
 all
 that
 is


to
 say
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 14
 years
 and
 I


think
 that's
 getting
 getting
 even


longer.
 If
 you
 take
 the
 market
 cap
 of,


you
 know,
 the
 um
 the
 private
 markets


valued
 above
 a
 billion
 dollars
 and,
 you


know,
 we
 could
 argue
 are
 some
 of
 them


overvalued,
 undervalued.
 Um
 but
 um
 that


whole
 value
 in
 aggregate
 is
 like
 three


and
 a
 half
 trillion
 dollars
 and
 that's


like
 11%.
 Three
 and a
 half
 trillion
 is


like
 11
 12%
 of
 the
 NASDAQ
 or
 10%
 of
 the


NASDAQ,
 something
 like
 that.
 Um
 if
 you


go
 back
 10
 years
 ago
 that
 whole
 private


market
 cap
 of
 three
 and
 a
 half
 trillion


was
 like
 500
 billion.
 So
 over
 the
 last


10
 years
 the
 market
 cap
 of
 these
 private


companies
 has
 like
 7x.
 So
 there's
 huge


growth
 like
 again
 that
 is
 related
 to


this
 point
 which
 is
 some
 of
 the
 best


companies
 taking
 longer
 deciding
 to
 stay


private
 longer.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 it's


it's
 pretty
 it's
 pretty
 stark.
 Um,
 so


the
 other
 thing
 that's
 going
 on,
 I


mentioned
 this
 earlier
 with
 Snowflake
 is


like
 the
 public
 markets
 are
 no
 longer


the
 place
 of
 extremely
 high
 growth.
 Like


it
 because
 of
 this
 and
 it's
 sort
 of


logic,
 it's
 logical,
 it
 follows,
 right?


Um,
 but
 something
 like
 5%
 of
 software


and
 internet
 public
 companies
 are


forecasting
 25%
 plus
 next
 12
 months


growth.
 So
 95%
 of
 the
 public
 market


universe
 in
 software
 and
 internet
 is


growing
 less
 than
 25%.


So
 if
 you
 want
 access
 to
 like
 the
 and


this
 is
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 bad


because
 you
 know
 there's
 obviously


implications
 for
 retail
 and
 stuff
 like


that.
 Um
 but
 the
 reality
 of
 what's


happened
 is
 the
 high
 growth
 segment
 of


new
 technology
 companies
 is
 all
 living


in
 the
 in
 the
 private
 markets
 now.
 um


you
 know
 for
 the
 most
 part
 and
 so
 I


don't
 see
 that
 changing.
 Um
 I
 do
 think


you
 know
 Figma
 and
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 good


companies
 like
 I
 think
 a
 bunch
 of
 good


companies
 will
 go
 public.
 Um
 but
 this
 is


a
 trend
 that
 you
 know
 is
 is
 is
 pretty


long-standing
 and
 I
 don't
 see
 it


reversing
 uh
 anytime
 soon.
 So


um
 we
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 really
 good
 AI


companies.
 Some
 people
 have
 asked,


they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 is
 isn't
 there
 like


crowding
 that's
 happened
 in
 some
 of
 the


best,
 you
 know,
 companies?"
 And
 um
 what


I
 would
 say
 is
 like
 one,
 we're
 getting


in
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies
 much
 earlier


than
 than
 others
 are
 able
 to.
 And
 two,


even
 for
 the
 ones
 that
 are
 later
 where


you
 know
 there
 are
 bigger
 rounds
 like


it's
 really
 important
 that
 we
 have
 that


early
 relationship
 because
 it
 gives
 us


ball
 control
 and
 access
 into
 the
 rounds


and
 XAI
 uh
 first
 outside
 money
 in
 beyond


Elon.
 So
 not
 only
 you
 know
 and
 a
 lot
 of


these
 are
 growth
 fund
 kind
 of
 first


money
 in
 um
 so
 you
 know
 it's
 important


to
 get
 in
 earlier
 to
 generate
 returns


but
 also
 to
 position
 us
 you
 know
 with


management
 and
 to
 have
 access
 uh
 to


shape
 later
 rounds.
 If
 I
 were
 just
 to


spend
 a
 second
 on
 you
 know
 how
 we
 have


like
 our
 shaped
 our
 AI
 strategy
 there's


basically
 two
 parts
 to
 what
 we're
 doing.


Um,
 one
 is
 the
 companies
 where
 they're


like
 flying
 off
 the
 page,
 you
 know,
 uh,


like
 undeniable
 momentum.
 Uh,
 so,
 you


know,
 companies
 like
 Cursor
 and
 Decagon


and
 11
 and
 a
 bridge
 and
 and,
 you
 know,


others.
 Um,
 the
 second
 bucket
 is
 um,


very
 early
 deals
 in
 the
 very
 very
 very


best
 teams
 in
 the
 market.
 And
 I
 say
 very


very
 best
 teams
 in
 the
 market
 like
 with


emphasis
 um
 because
 I
 think
 we're


talking
 about
 like
 the
 top
 five
 teams
 in


the
 world
 and
 anything
 beyond
 that
 we're


not
 doing
 these
 companies.
 they're


they're
 sort
 of
 a
 different
 shape.
 Um


they're
 growth
 dollars
 earlier
 than


normal
 and
 there's
 a
 higher
 degree
 of


variance
 in
 the
 business
 outcomes,
 but


because
 the
 teams
 are
 so
 special
 and
 so


great,
 we
 feel
 like
 business
 risk
 looks


very
 different
 from
 capital
 risk.
 And
 so


we
 we
 feel
 like
 there's
 it's
 kind
 of


they're
 kind
 of
 asymmetric
 bets
 where


the
 asymmetry
 lies
 in
 the
 fact
 that


we're
 probably
 downside
 protected
 um


because
 the
 team
 quality
 is
 so
 high
 and


there's
 so
 much
 you
 know
 demand
 uh
 for


talent
 like
 you
 know
 we
 would
 be


downside
 protected
 even
 if
 it
 doesn't


work
 out
 and
 so
 high
 business
 you
 know


sort
 of
 variance
 but
 you
 know
 sort
 of


asymmetric
 capital
 or
 returns
 profile


that
 looks
 a
 little
 bit
 different
 uh


than
 a
 typical
 early
 stage
 investment.


We
 talk
 about
 timelines
 to
 um
 exits


because
 on
 one
 dimension,
 you
 know,


folks
 may
 may
 take
 the
 reaction
 of
 gosh,


you
 know,
 private
 for
 longer
 means
 just


extension
 of
 hold
 periods
 for
 LSB


companies.
 Maybe
 the
 reframe
 on
 it
 is


why
 is
 that
 great
 for
 for
 us,
 but


frankly
 as
 private
 investors
 and
 and
 why


do
 we
 think
 it's
 actually
 advantageous


in
 um
 some
 respects
 for
 some
 companies


to
 actually
 delay
 time
 to
 IPO
 and
 how


are
 you
 counseling
 folks
 as
 a
 part
 of


that?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 it's
 a
 trick
 it's
 a


tricky
 issue.
 I
 mean,
 I
 said
 it
 right
 up


front,
 which
 is
 like
 I
 we
 get
 paid
 on
 on


DPI,
 too.
 Like,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 that's


that's
 that's
 how
 we
 that's
 how
 we


compensate
 ourselves
 and
 our
 teams.
 And


so,
 you
 know,
 we
 care
 we
 care
 a
 lot


about
 it.
 I
 would
 say
 we're
 in
 a


fortunate
 position
 where
 our
 portfolio


is
 is
 pretty
 good.
 Um,
 and
 we've
 had
 a


number
 of
 companies
 that
 have
 have


exited
 to
 the
 public
 markets
 or
 sold


themselves.
 Um
 and
 so
 you
 know
 we're
 not


in
 a
 position
 where
 we
 haven't
 been
 able


to
 deliver
 some
 liquidity.
 Um
 for
 those


sort
 of
 champion
 companies
 that
 have


been
 private
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 and
 are


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 coverage.
 Uh
 I
 think


each
 kind
 of
 has
 idiosyncratic
 reasons


why
 they've
 wanted
 to
 stay
 private
 and


you
 know
 I
 think
 I'm
 confident
 that
 they


will
 go
 public.
 So
 um
 so
 I
 think
 most
 of


them
 will
 probably
 end
 up
 going
 public.


It
 just
 will
 take
 a
 longer
 amount
 of


time.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 big
 uh


things
 that
 we've
 observed
 is
 the


private
 markets
 have
 adapted
 to
 some
 of


what
 you
 get
 from
 the
 public
 markets.


Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 we've
 fortunately
 been


very
 active
 in
 in
 some
 of
 those


situations.
 So
 things
 like
 um,
 you
 know,


tend
 tender
 offers
 in
 the
 private


markets.
 A
 big
 thing
 that
 is
 hard
 for


private
 companies
 is
 competing
 for


talent.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 part
 of
 the


reason
 why
 it's
 so
 hard
 is
 because


public
 companies
 grant
 RSUs
 that


typically
 vest
 on
 a
 quarterly
 basis
 and


so
 they
 hit
 your
 account.
 They're


already
 tax
 withheld
 and
 it's
 basically


like
 getting
 paid
 a
 lot
 of
 cash
 and
 it's


hard
 for
 private
 market
 companies
 in


some
 cases
 to
 compete
 with
 that.
 Um,
 so


you
 know,
 some
 of
 the
 bigger
 better
 ones


have
 done
 more
 regular
 tenders
 and
 we've


been
 very
 active
 in
 shaping
 those
 uh


with
 the
 companies.
 So
 to
 me
 it's
 a


balance.
 We
 kind
 of
 want
 what's
 best
 for


the
 company.
 If
 there's
 strategic


reasons
 why
 it
 benefits
 them
 to
 be


private,
 that's
 great
 and
 we'll
 help


enable
 that.
 Um,
 but
 we
 do
 recognize


that
 obviously,
 you
 know,
 our
 goal
 is
 to


to
 monetize
 uh
 great
 investments.
 We're


not
 there
 yet
 where
 we
 feel
 like
 there's


a
 need
 to
 do
 unnatural
 things.
 Uh
 I
 I


just
 don't
 see
 that
 being
 the
 case


>> for
 sure.
 And
 I
 I
 do
 want
 to
 call
 out
 as


well
 um
 I'm
 going
 to
 brag
 on
 behalf
 of


you
 David
 because
 I
 I
 do
 think
 uh
 DPI


generally
 is
 an
 issue
 and
 challenge


across
 the
 industry.
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 is


our
 issue
 necessarily.
 Um
 okay
 I'm
 going


to
 also
 cover
 a
 question
 here.
 Thank
 you


for
 letting
 me
 uh
 do
 our
 commercial


David
 on
 DPI.
 You
 know
 it's
 my
 favorite


topic.
 uh
 on
 the
 topic
 of
 of
 um
 when
 you


think
 about
 some
 of
 the
 names
 that
 we


have
 underwritten
 you
 know
 I
 think
 there


is
 this
 broader
 question
 of
 gosh
 like


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 of
 names
 for
 example


like
 um
 you
 know
 the
 chat
 uh
 open
 ais
 of


the
 world
 and
 also
 data
 bricks
 that
 feel


like
 you
 know
 they're
 doing
 more
 of


these
 tender
 offers
 they're
 doing
 more


of
 these
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 SPVS
 how
 do


you
 counter
 that
 portfolio
 composition


of
 names
 like
 that
 versus
 names
 like
 an


android
 roll
 or
 flock
 where
 it's


probably
 very
 very
 difficult
 to
 get
 any


access
 and
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the


configuration
 of
 the
 portfolio
 as
 a
 part


of
 that?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look
 um
 I
 mean
 the
 opening


eye
 investment
 that
 we
 made
 um
 you
 know


we


we
 were
 able
 to
 write
 exactly
 the
 check


that
 we
 wanted
 to
 write
 um
 you
 know
 in


terms
 of
 sort
 of
 portfolio
 construction.


So
 to
 me
 it
 doesn't
 seem,
 you
 know,
 I'm


sure
 I'm
 sure
 some
 folks
 have
 had
 access


because
 other
 managers
 are
 are
 trying
 to


do
 SPVS
 and
 stuff,
 but
 I
 think
 that's


increasingly
 hard.
 Um,


uh,
 you
 know,
 it's
 also
 sort
 of
 our


decision
 on
 how
 much
 to
 wait
 these


opportunities
 and
 build
 a
 portfolio.
 Um,


so
 you
 know,
 I
 happen
 to
 think
 that
 the


return
 profile
 of
 of
 that
 recent
 one
 and


data
 bricks
 is
 is
 very
 attractive.
 Um,


but
 you
 know,
 we
 don't
 want
 an
 entire


portfolio
 of
 things
 that
 we
 think
 are


like
 pretty
 safe
 2xs,
 you
 know,
 where
 I


think
 the
 question
 is,
 can
 we
 make
 5x
 on


them,
 but
 like
 we
 feel
 pretty
 confident


we
 can
 make
 3
 to
 4x
 and
 2x
 is
 pretty


safe.


>> Awesome.
 Speaking
 of
 um
 public


companies,
 we
 had
 a
 question
 from
 from


Paige
 here
 on
 um
 well
 actually
 it's
 it's


two
 related
 questions.
 Um,


what
 publicly
 traded
 software
 companies


do
 you
 think
 won't
 be
 disrupted
 by
 a
 AI


and
 have
 real
 modes
 and
 any
 obvious
 ones


that
 you
 think
 it
 will
 be?
 And
 related


to
 that,
 I
 think
 we
 had
 some
 questions


earlier
 on
 around
 uh
 how
 much
 if
 at
 all


any
 public
 companies
 you
 do
 in
 the
 fund?


>> Yeah,
 probably
 very
 few
 public
 companies


in
 the
 fund.
 I
 mean,
 we'd
 have
 to
 have
 a


really
 really
 strong
 thesis
 and


relationship
 with
 the
 management
 team
 to


want
 to
 do
 that.
 Um,
 again,
 the
 public


universe
 is
 just
 way
 slower
 growing
 and


there's
 really
 really
 exciting
 stuff


that
 we
 can
 do
 in
 the
 private
 universe


and
 so
 the
 bar
 is
 extraordinarily
 high


um,
 you
 know,
 for
 things
 in
 the
 in
 the


public
 markets
 and
 we've
 done
 a
 couple


which
 have
 worked
 out
 I
 would
 say.
 Um,


but
 you
 know
 the
 bar
 is
 very
 high
 and


the
 the
 opportunity
 cost
 is
 probably


something
 that
 may
 be
 even
 higher
 growth


uh,
 in
 in
 the
 private
 markets.
 Um,
 yeah,


the
 what
 what
 companies
 are
 going
 to
 get


disrupted
 in
 the
 public
 markets
 like
 I


love
 this
 question.
 I
 don't
 know
 all
 all


I
 would
 offer
 this
 framework
 which
 is


which
 is
 maybe
 there's
 three
 interesting


ingredients
 to
 consider
 when
 you
 think


about
 the
 safety
 or
 durability
 of
 the
 of


the
 public
 software
 companies.
 One
 would


be
 you
 know
 UIUX.
 So
 if
 to
 the
 extent


that
 we
 get
 a
 complete
 re-imagination
 of


UIUX


um
 you
 know
 that'll
 be
 really
 exciting.


Like
 what
 is
 Salesforce.com?


Salesforce.com
 is
 like
 a
 set
 of
 really


uninteresting


um
 you
 know
 checklists
 and
 forms
 that


people
 fill
 out
 for
 the
 most
 part
 on
 the


front
 end.
 Um
 the
 promise
 of
 this
 stuff


you
 know
 agents
 is
 like
 a
 way
 overused


term
 but
 like
 like
 the
 new
 technology


should
 be
 able
 to
 like
 do
 things
 for
 you


as
 opposed
 to
 like
 keep
 your
 records
 for


you.
 And
 so
 you
 could
 imagine
 a


completely
 reimagined
 UI
 UX
 which
 is


proactive,
 which
 is
 like,
 hey,
 instead


of
 you
 going
 and
 inputting
 things,
 I'm
 I


know
 what
 you're
 doing.
 I'm
 just
 going


to
 tell
 you
 what
 to
 do.
 Um,
 and
 so
 a


total
 reimagination
 of
 the
 workflow
 um


would
 be
 one
 ingredient
 for
 a
 startup
 to


win
 versus
 an
 incumbent.
 The
 second


would
 be
 access
 to
 data.
 Um
 so
 you
 know


an
 entirely
 new
 form
 of
 data
 that
 gets


sucked
 in
 to
 take
 the
 actions
 on
 your


behalf
 like
 Salesforce
 you
 know
 I


mentioned
 the
 form
 thing
 on
 the
 front


end
 the
 reason
 it's
 really
 really
 sticky


is
 the
 database
 on
 the
 back
 end
 so
 to


the
 extent
 that
 instead
 of
 using
 that


sort
 of
 structured
 database
 on
 the
 back


end
 you
 take
 all
 of
 your
 unstructured


data
 and
 dump
 it
 into
 a
 data
 bricks
 for


example
 um
 you
 know
 and
 and
 query
 it
 or


access
 it
 through
 that
 um
 that
 would
 be


another
 interesting
 sort
 of
 opportunity


for
 a
 startup
 to
 attack.
 Um
 and
 then
 the


third
 is
 a
 business
 model
 innovation
 and


I
 mentioned
 this
 already
 it's
 super


super
 early
 days
 but
 to
 the
 extent
 that


startups
 can
 come
 up
 with
 an
 you
 know


sort
 of
 like
 novel
 way
 of
 shifting
 the


business
 model
 in
 a
 disruptive
 form
 uh


against
 like
 seatbased
 pricing


salesforce.com


uh
 you
 know
 it
 would
 be
 uh
 it
 would
 have


a
 chance
 to
 win.
 So,
 I
 think
 for


startups
 to
 win,
 I
 think
 you
 need
 all


three.
 Um,
 and
 that's
 just
 in
 the


head-to-head
 stuff.
 I
 think
 startups
 are


already
 finding
 interesting
 windows
 of


opportunity
 in
 and
 around
 these
 systems


of
 record.
 Um,
 which
 we've
 made
 a
 bunch


of
 investments
 in.
 We
 haven't
 found
 the


startup
 that's
 like
 got
 the
 killer
 idea


for
 like
 dethroning
 salesforce.com
 yet.


I
 hope
 we
 find
 it.
 So,
 I
 know
 that's
 an


unsatisfactory
 answer,
 but
 at least
 it's


like
 a
 a
 f
 that's
 the
 framework
 I
 would


use
 to
 to
 think
 about
 those
 those
 three


buckets.


>> Awesome.
 Okay,
 I'm
 getting
 the
 hook


because
 I
 know
 we
 only
 have
 a
 few


minutes
 left
 of
 this
 webinar.
 So,
 maybe


in
 the
 last
 couple
 minutes,
 we'll
 uh


fast
 forward
 here
 to
 uh
 to
 talk
 about


the
 team.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it
 took
 us


over
 an
 hour
 plus
 to
 get
 to
 this
 point.


So
 maybe
 we'll
 go
 through
 that
 and
 then


David
 also
 how
 you
 work
 with
 the
 broader


A16Z
 team
 and
 I'll
 bring
 us
 all
 back


home
 with
 how
 this
 all
 fits
 in
 in
 the


broader
 uh
 franchise
 and
 firm
 as
 well.


>> Yes,
 I
 love
 the
 team.
 Uh
 they're
 uh


they're
 very
 very
 smart.
 Uh
 they've
 come


together
 in
 in
 an
 awesome
 way.
 We
 have
 a


really
 strong
 sort
 of
 team
 subculture.


Um
 you
 know
 we
 are
 very
 very very


intertwined
 with
 the
 early
 stage
 teams.


Um
 you
 know
 if
 you
 think
 about
 like


where
 we
 get
 alpha
 in
 our
 business
 um


you
 know
 there's
 access
 which
 I've


talked
 about
 already
 um
 you
 know
 in


terms
 of
 like
 you
 know
 being
 already


involved
 in
 the
 companies
 and
 and
 80%
 of


the
 time
 when
 we
 make
 a
 new
 investment


that's
 not
 an
 early
 stage
 investment
 one


of
 our
 early
 stage
 folks
 has
 some


pre-existing
 relationship
 so
 um
 you
 know


access
 is
 a
 big
 piece
 of
 it
 insights
 is


the
 other
 piece
 like
 I
 think
 the
 way
 you


get
 really
 you
 know
 like
 outsized
 upsize


you
 know
 returns
 in
 our
 business
 is


market
 and
 product
 insights.
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 you
 you
 have
 to
 do
 all
 the


analysis
 around
 business
 model
 and


financials
 because
 you
 can
 make
 big


mistakes
 if
 you
 get
 that
 wrong
 and
 we
 go


super
 deep
 in
 each
 of
 those.
 Um,
 but
 I


think
 the
 real
 outlier
 opportunities


come
 when
 you
 have
 a
 market
 or
 product


insight
 that
 maybe
 the
 rest
 of
 the


market
 hasn't
 figured
 out
 yet.
 And
 you


know
 the
 fact
 that
 we're
 attached
 to
 the


early
 stage
 team
 gives
 us
 the


opportunity
 to
 have
 those
 and
 gives
 us
 a


tremendous
 amount
 of
 leverage
 to
 have
 a


relatively
 small
 amount
 of
 team
 uh
 small


amount
 of
 team
 members
 given
 how
 much


how
 much
 ground
 we
 cover.


>> I
 will
 also
 uh
 take
 the
 opportunity
 to


uh
 brag
 on
 your
 team
 and
 my
 team
 because


I
 think
 both
 of
 our
 teams
 got
 a
 91%
 on


the
 employee
 engagement
 score.
 So
 not


that
 we're
 competing
 across
 teams,
 but


uh
 you
 know
 this
 is
 a
 good
 barometer
 for


team
 subculture
 uh
 no
 doubt
 and
 uh


something
 we
 always
 we
 do
 around
 the


firm
 uh
 year
 round
 which
 is
 very


company-like
 but
 hopefully
 gives
 you
 a


sense
 of
 what
 we're
 measuring
 uh
 you


know
 ourselves
 across
 as
 well
 in
 terms


of
 of
 team
 culture.
 Um
 but
 I
 want
 to


spend
 a
 minute
 to
 illustrate
 the
 point


that
 David
 alluded
 to
 around
 how
 we
 work


in
 collaboration
 with
 the
 early
 stage


and
 also
 um
 think
 about
 the
 latest
 stage


venture
 in
 terms
 of
 sitting
 across
 all


the
 six
 different
 early
 stage
 buckets
 uh


across
 the
 across
 the
 firm.
 And
 so
 maybe


David
 if
 you
 want
 to
 give
 just
 like
 the


highlevel
 talk
 track
 on
 if
 you
 were
 to


hypothesize
 what
 the
 composition
 of
 the


portfolio
 would
 look
 like
 across
 these


six
 different
 buckets
 that'd
 be
 helpful.


And
 then
 I
 saw
 a
 question
 around
 how


much
 we
 would
 expect
 around
 crypto


investments
 and
 particularly
 around


token
 crypto
 investments.
 Um
 that
 would


be
 helpful.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 The
 best
 part
 about


where
 we
 are
 is
 we've
 got
 people
 at
 the


early
 stage
 figuring
 out
 where
 they


think
 they
 should
 be
 spending
 their


time.
 And
 typically,
 you
 know,
 our
 world


is
 like
 12
 to
 24
 months
 downstream
 of


that.
 So
 when
 you
 see
 the
 way
 we
 size


our
 funds
 at
 the
 early
 stage,
 that's
 a


reflection
 of
 what
 those
 early
 stage


teams
 think
 is
 their
 opportunity
 set.


and
 you
 know
 ours
 sort
 of
 follows
 that.


So
 I
 think
 the
 largest
 amount
 of


opportunity
 will
 continue
 to
 be
 AI


infraai
 apps.
 Next
 American
 Dynamism
 you


know
 our
 early
 stage
 team
 is
 killing
 it


in
 that
 area.
 You
 know
 beyond
 just
 AI


there's
 obviously
 a
 pressing
 uh
 you
 know


sort
 of
 market
 and
 world
 need
 for


American
 dynamism
 companies.
 So
 you
 had


at
 the
 same
 time
 you
 have
 market
 need


you
 had
 people
 that
 figured
 out
 how
 to


do
 this
 inside
 of
 SpaceX
 and
 and
 uh


Palunteer
 who
 have
 then
 left
 to
 start


companies.
 So
 the
 talent
 is
 there
 to


navigate
 um
 you
 know
 a
 a
 very
 complex
 uh


go
 to
 market
 uh
 motion.
 Um
 and
 then
 you


have
 advances
 in
 technology
 beyond
 genai


like
 uh
 autonomy
 capabilities
 and
 vision


uh
 advances
 that
 enable
 American


dynamism.
 So
 we're
 very
 excited
 about


that
 area.
 We're
 starting
 to
 see
 a


little
 bit
 more
 interesting
 stuff
 in
 AI


enabled
 health
 things.
 So,
 we've
 done
 a


couple
 um
 you'll
 continue
 to
 see
 us


active
 there,
 but
 it's
 probably
 a
 little


bit
 less
 than
 uh
 the
 AI
 infra
 and
 app


side.
 And
 then
 crypto
 um
 the
 way
 we're


doing
 that
 is
 working
 um
 you
 know


handinhand
 with
 Chris
 and
 the
 crypto


team
 uh
 for
 their
 high
 conviction
 bets


where
 they're
 at
 a
 stage
 that
 they
 fit


you
 know
 the
 growth
 fund
 and
 um
 and
 you


know
 I
 I
 brag
 on
 them.
 I
 think
 they're


the
 best
 crypto
 investors
 in
 the
 world


and
 and
 we
 sort
 of
 are
 happy
 to
 attach


ourselves
 to
 that
 and
 to
 certainly


depends
 on
 the
 opportunity
 set
 like


we're
 seeing
 really
 exciting
 stuff
 in


the
 enablement
 of
 stable
 coins.
 Um
 and


and
 so
 you
 know
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 we


see
 like
 a
 massive
 takeoff
 and
 in
 that


market
 it
 could
 be
 more.
 I
 always
 say
 it


would
 be
 great
 if
 a
 100%
 of
 our


investment
 activity
 in
 the
 growth
 fund


was
 followons
 uh
 because
 that
 would
 mean


that
 our
 early
 stage
 team
 is
 absolutely


killing
 it
 and
 and
 they're
 getting
 a
 lot


of
 market
 share.
 Um
 but
 you
 know
 I
 think


there
 will
 always
 be
 a
 place
 for
 us
 to


do
 really
 attractive
 new
 things.
 Um
 and


we
 don't
 build
 the
 portfolio
 based
 on


some
 target
 around
 new
 versus
 followon.


It's
 it's
 really
 like
 best
 ideas
 when


you
 know
 where
 do
 we
 have
 access
 right


to
 win
 etc.


>> Great.
 Um
 and
 then
 uh
 less
 than
 60


seconds.
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 take
 Annie's


question?
 So
 on
 the
 topic
 of
 portfolio


construction,
 how
 much
 exposure
 do
 you


want
 to
 top
 research
 teams
 with
 a
 wide


fan
 of
 outcomes
 versus
 opportunities


with
 a
 more
 narrow
 range?
 How
 many
 more


researchers
 do
 you
 think
 are
 actually


out
 there
 um
 you
 know
 beyond
 the
 ones


that
 you've
 already
 backed
 that
 that
 you


will
 get
 more
 exposure
 to?


>> There
 are


extremely
 high-end
 researchers
 at
 some


of
 the
 big
 labs
 that
 we
 we
 our
 early


stage
 team
 is
 tracking.
 And
 I
 should


have
 mentioned
 this
 when
 we
 do
 these
 we


do
 them
 with
 the
 AI
 infra
 fund.
 So
 we


would
 not
 you
 know
 we
 we
 rely
 on
 them


heavily
 uh
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we're
 doing


the
 right
 assessment
 of
 the
 teams
 and


the
 you
 know
 the
 research
 ideas
 that


they're
 pursuing.
 Um
 you
 know
 in
 terms


of
 portfolio
 construction
 I
 I I
 quite


like
 the
 way
 that
 we've
 done
 it.
 Um


where
 you
 know
 we
 have
 some
 you
 know


absolute
 champion
 companies
 that
 we
 we


think
 actually
 have
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 room


still
 to
 run.
 um
 where
 on
 the
 downside


we
 think
 we
 would
 if
 things
 really
 go


poorly
 like
 we'd
 still
 probably
 make
 two


times
 our
 money
 and
 on
 the
 upside
 you


know
 there
 may
 not
 be
 the
 opportunity


for
 10x
 over
 five
 years
 but
 we
 think


there
 will
 be
 the
 opportunity
 for
 5x


over
 5
 years
 the
 research
 team
 with
 the


high
 variance
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 an


output
 of
 that
 great
 opportunity
 set


like
 right
 now
 there's
 not
 another
 Ilia


floating
 around
 in
 the
 AI
 market
 and
 so


we
 would
 never
 try
 and
 say
 oh
 we
 want


10%
 of
 our
 portfolio
 to
 be
 in
 these
 so


we
 need
 to
 find
 someone.
 It's
 more


reactive
 when
 we
 do
 find
 those
 people


who
 are
 really
 special.
 I
 think
 the
 only


shift
 that
 we'll
 see
 over
 time
 is
 I


think
 you're
 seeing
 a
 bunch
 of
 really


really
 really
 exciting
 AI
 apps
 and


American
 Dynamism
 companies
 at
 the


earlier
 stage
 that
 are
 poised
 to
 become


kind
 of
 champion
 companies
 over
 the
 next


five
 years.
 Um
 and
 so
 you'll
 probably


see
 a
 lot
 of
 activity
 from
 us
 uh
 from
 us


uh
 in
 those
 kinds
 of
 companies.


>> Awesome.
 And
 with
 that
 I'm
 going
 to


close
 out
 here
 lastly.
 Thank
 you
 David.


Appreciate
 it.


>> Great
 to
 hang
 as
 always.
