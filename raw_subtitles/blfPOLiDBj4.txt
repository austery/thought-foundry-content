I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz,
 editor
 [music]
 of
 the


New
 York
 Times
 Book
 Review,
 and
 this
 is


the
 book
 review
 podcast.
 It's
 the
 middle


of
 January,
 which
 [music]
 means
 there
 is


some
 major
 football
 happening.
 This
 week


was
 the
 NCAA
 National
 Championship
 game.


[music]


The
 weekend
 this
 episode
 is
 publishing.


The
 NFL
 Conference
 Championship
 games


are
 going
 to
 be
 taking
 place.
 And
 the


big
 one,
 Super
 Bowl
 60,
 [music]
 is


happening
 on
 February
 8th.
 And
 like
 many


members
 of
 my
 Puerto
 Rican
 [music]


family,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 watching
 almost


entirely
 for
 Bad
 Bunny's
 Hattime
 Show.


[music]
 And
 that's
 because
 I
 don't


really
 watch
 football,
 which
 is
 going to


make
 this
 week's
 interview
 a
 very
 fun


challenge.
 I'm
 speaking
 with
 Chuck


Clustermanman,
 author,
 critic,
 the
 man


behind
 a
 dozen
 [music]
 books
 of


non-fiction
 and
 fiction,
 and
 author
 of


the
 newly
 released
 and
 [music]
 very


directly
 titled
 Football.
 Chuck,
 I
 don't


care
 much
 about
 football
 or
 really
 any


sport,
 but
 I
 do
 care
 about
 you
 and
 your


books
 and
 the
 way
 you
 think,
 which
 is


why
 I'm
 excited
 to
 have
 you
 on
 this


week,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 read
 this
 book.


Welcome
 to
 the
 book
 review
 podcast.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me
 on,
 and
 I


appreciate
 you
 reading
 this
 book
 without


having
 much
 interest
 in
 football.
 I
 do


find
 that
 I
 am
 trying
 to
 thread
 sort
 of


a
 strange
 very
 specific
 needle.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 think
 when
 you
 write
 a
 book
 about
 a


sport,
 there
 is
 this
 idea
 that
 well
 is


this
 for
 people
 who
 are
 obsessed
 with
 it


or
 is
 it
 for
 a
 person
 who
 has
 some


aesthetic
 distance
 from
 this
 or
 just


knows
 that
 it's
 going
 on.
 Like
 if
 I


wrote
 a
 book
 about
 trees,
 no
 one
 would


be
 like,
 well,
 you
 got
 to
 be
 a


lumberjack
 to
 enjoy
 this.
 That
 doesn't


really
 happen.
 So,
 I'm
 I'm
 trying
 to
 do


both
 of
 those
 things
 and
 I
 recognize
 the


complexity
 in
 that.
 So,
 my
 initial
 idea


for
 this
 conversation
 was
 we're
 going
 to


have
 an
 entire
 episode
 in
 which
 Chuck


tries
 to
 convince
 me
 to
 care
 about


sports.
 But
 I
 realized
 one
 can
 only
 be


so
 self-involved.
 So,
 we're
 not
 going
 to


do
 that.
 I
 have
 to
 imagine,
 however,


that
 many
 of
 the
 interviews
 that
 you
 are


going
 to
 do
 about
 this
 book
 are
 going
 to


be
 with
 people
 who
 are
 invested
 in


football
 given
 that
 it
 literally
 is
 the


biggest
 thing
 in
 America.
 And
 yet,
 as


you
 write
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 your
 new


book,
 quote,
 "My
 target
 market
 is
 the


unborn,
 closely
 followed
 by
 the
 recently


born,
 closely
 followed
 by
 a
 handful
 of


present-
 day
 adults
 who
 likely
 have
 no


interest
 in
 what
 I'm
 writing
 about.


That's
 me."
 Your
 book
 is
 essentially
 a


series
 of
 essays.
 You
 have
 an
 argument


for
 the
 greatest
 player
 of
 all
 time.
 You


have
 a
 look
 at
 the
 oddities
 of
 Canadian


football,
 which
 I
 knew
 nothing
 about.
 An


argument
 for
 how
 football
 might


eventually
 die
 out
 in
 popularity.
 You've


cared
 about
 football
 for
 a
 very
 long


time.
 How
 did
 you
 know
 or
 decide
 that


this
 was
 the
 moment
 to
 devote
 an
 entire


book
 to
 it?


>> I
 think
 I've
 unconsciously
 been
 thinking


about
 football
 for
 most
 of
 my
 life,


40ome
 years
 or
 whatever.
 It
 was
 probably


20
 years
 ago
 or
 15
 years
 ago
 where
 I


decided
 at
 some
 point
 I
 do
 want
 to
 write


a
 book
 about
 sports.
 You
 know,
 I've


always
 mentioned
 sports
 here
 and
 there


in
 the
 culture
 writing
 I
 had
 done
 or
 the


kind
 of
 conventional
 pop
 culture
 writing


I
 had
 done,
 but
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 a
 like
 a


real
 sports
 book.
 And
 I
 think
 initially


my
 idea
 was
 it
 would
 be
 about


basketball,
 but
 over
 time
 it
 became
 very


clear
 to
 me
 it
 has
 to
 be
 about
 football


for
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons.
 One,
 it's


meaning
 to
 the
 culture
 at
 large.
 and
 my


realization
 that
 even
 though
 I
 may
 love


basketball
 as
 a
 game
 more,
 the
 role


football
 plays
 in
 my
 life
 is
 completely


outsized
 and
 completely
 dwarfs


everything
 else
 in
 terms
 of
 my
 interest


in
 sports
 and
 watching
 and
 consuming
 it.


So,
 it
 seemed
 as
 though
 if
 you're
 going


to
 do
 a
 [clears throat]
 sports
 book,


particularly
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 society,


there
 is
 only
 one
 choice
 in
 the
 United


States.


And
 when
 you
 say
 you
 have
 been
 a
 sports


fan
 for
 much
 of
 your
 life,
 as
 you
 write


in
 this
 book,
 you
 from
 the
 time
 you
 were


a
 child
 were
 football
 pill.
 You
 love
 the


Dallas
 Cowboys.
 You
 played
 football
 in


high
 school.
 The
 way
 that
 you
 got
 into


journalism,
 as
 I
 understand
 it,
 is
 you


started
 to
 write
 about
 sports
 in


college.
 That
 is
 something
 that
 has
 been


in
 your
 mind
 this
 entire
 time.
 Yet
 you


are
 most
 well
 known
 for
 being
 a
 culture


writer,
 a
 wonderful
 culture
 writer
 who


loves
 to
 think
 through
 the
 naughty
 ways


in
 which
 we
 consume
 culture
 and
 think


about
 culture.
 Football
 is
 culture.
 What


did
 you
 want
 to
 do
 with
 this
 book?
 It's


a
 series
 of
 essays.
 Were
 there
 problems


that
 you
 were
 trying
 to
 solve?
 I
 don't


know
 if
 I
 work
 in
 that
 way.
 I
 the
 kind


of
 the
 the
 analogy
 I
 always
 use
 about


this
 is
 I
 feel
 like
 in
 my
 mind


everything
 I've
 ever
 thought
 or
 felt
 or


believed
 or
 considered
 about
 football
 is


like
 a
 ball
 of
 yarn
 and
 then
 the
 process


of
 writing
 is
 just
 pulling
 the
 string


and
 straightening
 it
 all
 out.
 So
 I
 knew


I
 wanted
 to
 write
 a
 book
 about
 football.


The
 meaning
 of
 it,
 the
 strange


combination
 of
 how
 it
 is
 imposed
 on


culture
 and
 culture's
 desire
 to
 steer


into
 it.
 what
 makes
 it
 so
 different
 from


other
 sports
 and
 particularly
 since
 I
 do


envision
 a
 time
 in
 a
 distant
 future
 when


football
 maybe
 doesn't
 disappear


entirely
 but
 definitely
 recedes
 from
 the


culture
 and
 then
 there's
 going
 to
 be


this
 attempt
 by
 people
 of
 that
 time
 to


explain
 what
 happened
 what
 it
 was
 and


what
 went
 wrong
 because
 this
 is
 always


the
 way
 it
 works
 that
 you
 know
 you
 look


back
 on
 something
 that
 was
 once
 dominant


and
 is
 no
 longer
 dominant
 so
 the


assessment
 has
 to
 be
 like
 well
 what
 made


it
 fail
 and
 I
 think
 those
 attempts
 are


usually
 wrong.
 I
 it
 doesn't
 really


matter
 what
 if
 we're
 talking
 about
 like


why
 what
 did
 jazz
 mean
 and
 why
 is
 jazz


no
 longer
 the
 center
 of
 musical
 culture.


I
 think
 people
 working
 now
 trying
 to


make
 those
 kind
 of
 judgments
 would
 not


really
 be
 in
 lock
 step
 with
 what
 really


did
 happen
 or
 how
 it
 really
 did
 feel.
 I


think
 they
 would
 be
 projecting
 the


present
 onto
 the
 past.
 So
 I
 thought
 I'm


going
 to
 write
 a
 book
 where
 when


football
 is
 at
 its
 apex
 where
 it
 is
 and


like
 the
 stats
 in
 the
 book
 are
 like
 in


2023


of
 the
 hundred
 most
 watched
 broadcasts


on
 television
 in
 the
 United
 States
 93


were
 NFL
 games
 and
 then
 three
 or
 four


more
 were
 college
 games.
 Like
 it


couldn't
 be
 really
 any
 more
 popular
 than


it
 is.
 It
 is
 the
 end
 of
 the
 monoculture.


Like
 that
 and
 Taylor
 Swift
 are
 it.
 And
 I


thought
 I'm
 going
 to
 write
 this
 book


now.
 It's
 a
 strange
 conceit
 because


obviously
 I'm
 doing
 this
 podcast.
 I'm


promoting
 this
 book.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 sell


it
 to
 people
 who
 are
 alive,
 but
 in
 my


mind,
 [laughter]
 I'm
 imagining
 someone


reading
 this
 book


>> 75
 years
 from
 now.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 being
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 was
 this
 thing


that
 was
 happening,
 and
 here's
 someone


trying
 to
 explain
 what
 it
 meant
 while
 it


was
 going
 on."


>> Was
 there
 a
 moment
 in
 the
 long
 arc
 of


your
 relationship
 to
 football
 when
 you


just
 realized
 this
 is
 this
 is
 it?
 This


is
 the
 thing
 that
 everyone
 that
 I
 know


that
 most
 people,
 many
 people
 in
 America


care
 about
 as
 much
 as
 anything.
 Was


there
 a
 game?
 Was
 there
 a
 moment?
 Was


there
 a
 pivot
 point?
 No.
 Because
 I
 do


think
 in
 some
 ways
 it
 was
 gradual
 and


one
 of
 those
 things
 that
 is
 invisible


until
 it's
 obvious.
 In
 the
 1970s,


football
 was
 already
 the
 most
 popular


sport
 in
 America.
 There
 was
 there
 really


wasn't
 any
 way
 to
 view
 it
 as
 anything


but
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 dominant
 sport.
 But


it
 wasn't
 discussed
 that
 way.
 It
 was


still
 seen
 as
 well
 baseball
 is
 the


national
 pastime
 and
 it
 was
 almost
 that


that
 we
 are
 still
 going
 to
 perceive
 this


other
 sport
 as
 the
 thing
 that
 defines


the
 country
 and
 the
 this
 football
 is


just
 popular.
 But
 as
 time
 has
 moved
 on,


it's
 now
 very
 palpable
 that
 baseball
 is


in
 many
 ways
 just
 a
 huge
 niche
 interest.


Every
 sport
 in
 the
 United
 States
 except


football
 to
 some
 level
 is
 a
 niche


interest.
 Now,
 the
 NBA
 is
 huge
 and
 NBA


players
 are
 incredibly
 high-profile,
 but


as
 a
 sport,
 it's
 almost
 completely
 out


of
 balance
 in
 a
 way
 that
 that
 doesn't


make
 sense
 to
 be
 honest.
 In
 Europe
 and


in
 South
 America
 and
 many
 countries,


it's
 like
 soccer
 is
 like
 the
 only
 sport


that
 is
 universally
 beloved.
 And
 yet,
 it


doesn't
 have
 the
 dominance,
 the


psychological
 dominance
 that
 football


has
 on
 American
 society.
 It
 doesn't


imbue
 sort
 of
 everything.
 Even
 for


people
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 it
 is
 even,


I
 think,
 a
 factor
 in
 the
 lives
 of
 people


who
 actively
 dislike
 it.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 tell
 me
 how
 football
 rules
 my


life
 even
 though
 I
 make
 it
 a
 point
 not


to
 engage
 with
 football
 at
 all.
 Is
 it


because
 I've
 invested


some
 emotion
 into
 saying
 I
 am
 not
 a


football
 guy
 or
 I'm
 not
 someone
 who


cares
 about
 football?


>> I
 guess
 the
 obvious
 answer
 is
 we're


doing
 this
 podcast,
 right?
 like
 you


you're
 this
 is
 a
 subject
 that
 within


your
 mind
 it's
 not
 really
 central
 to
 how


you
 live
 but
 yet
 there's
 almost
 an


unconscious
 understanding
 like
 well
 I


know
 this
 is
 big
 though
 I
 know
 this
 is


bigger
 than
 almost
 anything
 I
 sometimes


it's
 a
 very
 small
 part
 but
 I
 often
 think


of
 this
 there's
 a
 couple
 paragraphs
 in


Jay
 McAernney's
 Bright
 Lights
 big
 city


where
 he
 walks
 into
 a
 bar
 and
 there's


like
 some
 sporting
 event
 on
 television
 I


don't even
 think
 it's
 football
 I
 think


it
 might
 be
 hockey
 in
 the
 book
 I
 can't


remember
 that
 but
 he
 he
 asks
 a
 question


about
 what
 quarter
 is
 it
 or
 what
 period


is
 it
 and
 the
 guy
 at
 the
 bars
 he
 has
 it


wrong
 and
 he
 mentions
 how
 he
 just
 feels


like
 I'll
 live
 my
 whole
 life
 cut
 out
 of


the
 world's
 biggest
 fraternity
 or


whatever
 and
 I
 [snorts]
 I
 I
 remember


thinking
 about
 that
 because
 that
 I
 read


that
 book
 when
 I
 was
 relatively
 young


and
 it
 had
 never
 occurred
 to
 me
 that


people
 could
 have
 an
 anxiety
 and
 a


strong
 feeling
 about
 something
 that
 they


think
 really
 is
 unimportant
 but
 they're


understanding
 that
 it
 matters
 to
 other


people
 makes
 them
 it's
 like
 they're
 a


bit
 awkward
 the
 language
 of
 Football
 has


just
 the
 idea
 of
 a
 political
 football


like
 the
 way
 we
 use
 it
 as
 part
 of
 the


lexicon
 and
 many
 terms
 from
 sports
 do


that
 but
 with
 football
 it
 is
 different.


the
 fact
 that
 there
 is
 a
 universal


understanding
 that
 football
 is


fundamentally
 conservative
 coded


>> and
 that
 the
 idea
 if
 you're
 trying
 to


picture
 the
 abstract
 football
 fan
 or
 the


abstract
 football
 coach
 it
 has
 a
 meaning


even
 without
 personality
 that
 the
 sort


of
 the
 the
 that
 term
 alone
 in
 what
 is


assumed
 to
 be
 the
 ancillary
 ideas
 that


go
 with
 that
 I
 just
 think
 are
 are
 really


galvanizing
 concrete.
 I
 as
 someone
 who


loves
 football
 and
 watches
 football
 all


the
 time,
 there
 was
 this
 temptation
 to


to
 just
 think
 about
 just
 what's
 on
 the


field.
 And
 then
 there's
 some
 in
 this


book
 where
 I
 talk
 about
 things
 that


happen
 specifically
 on
 the
 field.
 But


then
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 ideas
 that
 are


about,
 well,
 this
 is
 really
 about
 the


audience
 and
 almost
 the
 caricature
 of


what
 football
 is
 and
 how
 that
 is


involved
 with
 other
 people.
 I
 know


exactly
 what
 you're
 talking
 about
 when


you
 reference
 that
 brief
 passage
 in


Jacob
 McEnney's
 book.
 The
 idea
 that


there
 is
 this
 giant
 fraternity
 that
 you


just
 are
 being
 left
 out
 of.
 I
 have
 the


anxiety
 of
 negative
 influence
 which
 is


the
 idea
 that
 yes
 I
 as
 a
 result
 of
 my


lack
 of
 investment
 in
 football
 or
 maybe


sports
 in
 general.
 I
 actually
 do
 not


know
 how
 to
 interact
 with
 a
 large
 number


of
 people
 in
 this
 country
 for
 whom


football
 and
 sports
 is
 a
 lingua
 frana
 is


something
 that
 no
 matter
 who
 you
 meet


you
 can
 just
 talk
 about
 a
 team
 a
 recent


thing
 that
 happened.
 You
 have
 this
 funny


story
 saying
 when
 your
 wife
 says,
 "We're


going to
 go
 out
 to
 dinner
 with
 this


couple
 that
 you
 don't
 really
 know."


You're
 saying
 in
 your
 mind,
 "God
 damn


it,
 I
 just
 hope
 this
 guy
 is
 a
 sports


fan.
 Cuz
 if
 not,
 I
 do
 not
 know
 what
 I'm


going
 to
 talk
 to
 him
 about."


>> Well,
 it's
 not
 that
 I
 do
 not
 know.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 talk
 to
 him


about.
 It
 might
 be
 a
 ton
 of
 things.


There
 could
 be
 a
 ton
 of
 things
 that
 we


have
 in
 common,
 but
 if
 he
 likes
 sports,


it
 almost
 transcends
 what
 his


personality
 is.
 he
 can
 be
 a
 jerk,
 but


it's
 he's
 really
 interested
 in
 SEC


football,
 so
 we
 can
 talk
 about
 that.
 And


there's
 there's
 a
 part
 of
 me
 that's


almost
 a
 little
 bit
 ashamed
 of
 that
 that


I
 feel
 as
 though
 I
 can't
 immediately
 be


comfortable
 with
 a
 guy
 unless
 he
 has


these
 interests.
 But
 if
 he
 has
 these


interests,
 I
 don't
 care
 what
 he's
 like


at
 all.
 Everything
 is
 fine.
 It
 is
 it
 is


bizarre.
 Like
 in
 this
 fraternity
 thing,


like
 it
 is
 interesting
 to
 me.
 There
 is


just
 no
 subject
 with
 a
 higher
 percentage


of
 people
 who
 have
 an
 expert
 level


knowledge
 of
 something.
 I
 can
 sit
 in
 an


airport
 chili
 and
 they're
 showing
 ESPN


or
 whatever
 on
 the
 screen
 there
 with
 the


sound
 down
 and
 there'll
 be
 a
 guy
 sitting


next
 to
 me
 and
 the
 likelihood
 that
 we


start
 talking
 about
 sports,
 football
 in


specific,
 and
 this
 guy
 will
 have
 enough


knowledge
 to
 basically
 be
 on
 television.


He
 might
 not
 be
 a
 broadcaster,
 but
 his


knowledge
 is
 almost
 identical.
 And
 that


happens
 a
 lot.
 There's
 not
 a
 lot
 of


subjects
 like
 that.
 I
 can't
 sit
 down
 in


that
 chili
 and
 start
 talking
 to
 somebody


say
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 film
 right


now.
 There's
 a
 sliver
 of
 chance
 that
 the


person
 might
 be
 like,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 I'm


interested
 in
 Marty
 Supreme
 and
 all."


But
 there's
 also
 a
 chance
 they're
 like,


there
 would
 be
 a
 weird
 thing
 almost
 to


enter
 the
 conversation
 with.
 It's
 never


weird
 to
 start
 talking
 about
 sports
 with


someone
 who
 likes
 sports.
 They
 think


it's
 the
 normal
 way
 to
 talk.
 I
 certainly


do.


>> Yeah.
 I
 was
 taken
 by
 a
 passage
 from
 from


your
 book.
 So
 football,
 as
 we've


established,
 uh
 the
 most
 obvious
 thing


that's
 ever
 been
 said,
 is
 the
 most


popular
 institution
 in
 the
 United


States.
 And
 you
 write
 that
 it
 quote


imitates
 American
 society
 by
 generating


a
 sensation
 of
 chaotic
 freedom
 within
 an


environment
 of
 near
 total
 control.
 And


that
 just
 sent
 my
 mind
 spinning.
 But
 I'm


curious,
 is
 that
 how
 America
 feels
 to


you?
 That's
 how
 football
 feels?
 Is
 that


how
 America
 feels?
 Oh,
 absolutely.
 Yeah.


And
 that
 this
 is
 not
 a
 new
 phenomenon.
 I


feel
 like
 this
 is
 something
 I've
 sensed


my
 entire
 life.
 When
 you
 talk
 to
 people


from
 other
 countries,
 they're
 almost
 I


don't know
 amused
 or
 whatever
 by
 like


the
 American
 obsession
 with
 freedom.
 And


yet
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 that
 was
 always


for
 me,
 even
 before
 I
 thought
 of
 it
 in


any
 kind
 of
 political
 context.
 It
 was


like
 that
 was
 always
 an
 important
 thing.


The
 idea
 that
 I
 had
 autonomy
 over
 my
 own


life
 and
 agency.
 And
 yet,
 society
 does


not
 really
 operate
 with
 the
 idea
 that
 we


are
 truly
 free.
 It's
 it
 gives
 the


illusion
 of
 freedom
 within
 these
 kind
 of


constraints.
 As
 long
 as
 you
 don't
 bump


up
 against
 those
 walls,
 you
 can
 feel


completely
 untethered.
 In
 that
 same


essay
 that
 you're
 referencing,
 I
 talk


about
 a
 different
 essay
 by
 the
 art


critic
 David
 Hickeyi
 who
 wrote
 Air
 and


he
 had
 this
 just
 amazing
 sports
 essay


called
 The
 Heresy
 of
 Zone
 Defense.
 And


it
 was
 about
 basketball,
 specifically
 a


play
 by
 Julius
 Irving
 in
 the
 1980
 NBA


finals
 against
 the
 Lakers.
 But
 really


what
 he's
 writing
 about
 is
 that
 all


rules
 or
 even
 like
 bylaws
 or
 just
 the


mindset
 of
 any
 game
 should
 be
 to


maximize
 the
 freedom
 of
 the
 players


because
 we
 want
 the
 players.
 We
 that's


what
 we're
 watching
 for.
 We
 like
 the


guys
 so
 we
 want
 them
 to
 have
 unlimited


freedom
 to
 do
 and
 express
 themselves.


Football
 does
 the
 exact
 opposite.


Football
 is
 by
 far
 the
 most
 controlled


team
 sport
 imaginable.
 Even
 a
 single


play
 comes
 in
 from
 the
 press
 box
 down
 to


the
 sideline
 to
 a
 coordinator
 who
 sends


the
 play
 in
 via
 a
 radio
 transmitter
 to


the
 quarterback
 who
 then
 looks
 at
 his


wristband
 to
 unlock
 the
 code
 to
 tell
 the


other
 10
 guys
 what
 they're
 going
 to
 do.


This
 happens
 over
 and
 over
 again.
 It
 is


in
 many
 ways
 like
 almost
 like
 a
 like
 a


bizarrely
 oversystemized
 corporate


situation.
 Now,
 when
 I
 describe
 it
 like


that,
 it
 seems
 like
 that
 should
 be


terrible.
 Nobody
 should
 want
 to
 watch
 a


sport
 with
 that
 with
 those
 conditions.


And
 yet
 football's
 the
 most
 popular


because
 of
 this.
 People
 want
 freedom
 for


themselves.
 They
 want
 control
 for
 every


other
 thing
 imaginable.
 And
 I
 think
 this


is
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 football
 in


some
 ways
 resonates
 with
 people
 in
 an


unconscious
 way.
 And
 if
 they're
 trying


to
 describe
 it,
 they're
 just
 like,
 "Oh,


I
 like
 to
 I
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 to
 space


out
 and
 watch
 these
 games.
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan


of
 the
 Bills
 or
 I'm
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 the


Giants
 or
 whatever."
 They
 almost
 try
 to


reduce
 it
 to
 this
 simple
 connection


they're
 having.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 is


simple.
 I
 think
 it's
 actually
 pretty


profound.
 I
 think
 the
 way
 football
 is


transmitted
 on
 television
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 a


incredibly
 complicated
 semiodic


experience
 that
 if
 you
 would
 if
 you


described
 it
 would
 seem
 like
 a
 a
 real


contradiction.
 It
 shouldn't
 work,
 but
 it


works
 better
 than
 anything.


>> You
 also
 write
 that
 the
 rise
 of
 football


and
 the
 rise
 of
 television
 happened
 in


parallel
 and
 these
 two
 things


encountered
 each
 other.
 They're
 really


made
 for
 each
 other,
 football
 and


television.
 And
 football
 success
 could


not
 have
 happened
 without
 the
 rise
 of


television.
 Television
 success
 maybe


could
 not
 have
 happened
 without
 the
 rise


of
 sports,
 without
 the
 rise
 of
 football.


And
 the
 way
 that
 we
 experience
 it
 now
 is


arguably,
 when
 you
 step
 back
 and
 think


about
 it,
 incredibly
 bizarre,
 but


actually
 is
 perfectly
 designed
 for
 the


sport
 that
 we
 are
 experiencing.


>> It
 is,
 and
 it's
 this
 is
 a
 hard
 thing
 to


describe
 briefly.
 It's
 a
 it's
 many
 pages


on
 this
 in
 some
 ways,
 but
 football
 is
 a


mediated
 experience
 even
 when
 there
 is


no
 media
 involved.
 That
 even
 if
 someone


is
 at
 a
 high
 school
 game
 with
 no


cameras,
 standing
 on
 the
 sideline
 in
 the


corner
 of
 the
 end
 zone
 watching


15-year-old
 guys,
 16-y
 old
 guys
 play


football,
 they
 are
 transposing
 that


experience
 into
 the
 mediated
 experience


because
 football's
 marriage
 to


television
 is
 unlike
 the
 relationship


between
 any
 other
 sport.
 Typically
 in


sports
 what
 the
 attempt
 of
 the
 televised


experience
 is
 to
 transfer
 the
 live


experience
 into
 a
 two-dimensional
 thing


to
 watch.
 Okay,
 hockey
 might
 be
 is
 one


exception
 because
 it's
 always
 better


live.
 Every
 other
 sport
 you
 can
 really


make
 an
 argument
 it's
 better
 live
 if
 the


conditions
 are
 perfect
 or
 it's
 better
 on


television
 because
 football
 is
 always


better
 on
 TV.
 There
 aren't
 many
 reasons


to
 go
 to
 a
 football
 game
 live,
 but
 none


of
 them
 can
 be
 I
 want
 to
 see
 the
 game


better.
 To
 really
 see
 the
 game,
 it
 has


to
 be
 televised.
 And
 even
 if
 you're


seeing
 it
 live,
 you
 are
 thinking
 in
 your


mind
 how
 it
 would
 appear
 on
 television


in
 order
 to
 understand
 it.


>> In
 several
 interviews
 you've
 already


done
 for
 this
 book,
 you've
 spoken
 about


this
 fascinating
 article
 from
 2010


published
 by
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal.


The
 article
 measured
 the
 average
 amount


of
 play
 over
 four
 NFL
 games,
 I
 believe,


and
 it
 concluded
 that
 over
 3
 hours
 there


actually
 were
 only
 11
 minutes
 of
 action.


Now,
 one,
 do
 you
 think
 16
 years
 later


that
 number
 is
 still
 generally
 right
 as


far
 as
 you
 know?
 And
 number
 two,
 you


think
 that
 11
 minutes
 of
 play
 is


actually
 just
 fine
 for
 a
 football
 game?


I


>> I
 would
 say
 it's
 more
 than
 fine.
 I
 think


it's
 almost
 perfect.
 I
 maybe
 if
 I
 really


got
 into
 the
 research,
 I
 would
 be
 like,


well,
 it'd
 be
 nice
 if
 it
 was
 13
 minutes,


but
 for
 the
 most
 part,
 yeah,
 you
 know,


that
 ratio
 was
 what
 you
 want.
 And
 of


course,
 that
 seems
 insane.
 If
 someone


was
 pitching
 a
 new
 sport
 and
 they
 were


like,
 "I
 got
 this
 great
 idea
 for
 a


game."
 Now,
 there's
 one
 kind
 of
 twist,


though.
 It
 takes
 three
 hours
 on


television
 and
 there's
 only
 11
 minutes


of
 action.
 People
 would
 be
 like,
 "This


is
 not
 going
 to
 work.
 We're
 not
 going
 to


do
 that."
 In
 the
 same
 way
 that
 if
 you


were
 trying
 to
 present
 an
 action
 movie,


and
 you
 said
 like,
 "Well,
 it's
 2
 hours,


but
 there's
 really
 only
 125
 seconds
 of


action."
 They'd
 be
 like, "That's
 not


what
 people
 want."
 And
 yet
 the
 way


football
 is
 structured,
 those
 11
 minutes


are
 ideal
 because
 there
 are
 these
 little


snippets,
 you
 know,
 five
 to
 seven


seconds
 of
 hyperinetic,
 superviolent,


incredibly
 complex
 action
 happening,


which
 creates
 the
 sensation,
 you
 could


say
 the
 illusion,
 but
 I
 would
 say
 the


sensation
 of
 something
 that
 is
 dynamic


and
 fastm
 moving
 and
 filled
 with
 action.


And
 yet
 the
 gaps
 in
 football
 all
 the


time
 when
 nothing
 is
 happening
 allows
 it


to
 take
 on
 this
 cerebral
 experience


where
 you're
 thinking
 about
 what


happened
 and
 why
 that
 happened.
 What


will
 happen
 next?
 What
 is
 the
 thinking


on
 what
 will
 happen
 next?
 You
 can
 also


think
 about
 things
 unrelated
 to
 the


game.
 You
 can
 think
 about
 your
 own
 life


momentarily
 and
 then
 go
 back
 into
 the


engagement.
 You
 can
 talk
 to
 someone


about
 what
 you're
 seeing
 in
 a
 way
 that


is
 very
 rich
 and
 satisfying.
 It
 is
 one


of
 those
 things
 like
 my
 whole
 career
 is


like
 me
 saying,
 "Well,
 this
 is
 actually


counterintuitive.
 This
 is
 the
 opposite


of
 what
 you
 think."
 But
 yet,
 this
 is
 one


example
 where
 I'm
 pretty
 confident
 it


is.
 It
 should
 not
 work
 the
 way
 it
 does.


But
 football
 actually
 provides
 the


visual
 experience
 of
 entertainment
 that


we
 want,
 not
 what
 we
 would
 describe.


What
 we
 would
 describe
 what
 we
 want


would
 be
 a
 very
 different
 thing.
 And
 if


we
 actually
 got
 it,
 it
 would
 never


succeed
 in
 this
 way.


>> And
 this
 is
 in
 contrast,
 as
 you
 write
 in


the
 book,
 to
 basketball.
 the
 other


sports
 in
 which
 there's
 action


constantly
 happening
 on
 screen
 and
 that


as
 you
 say
 if
 football
 were
 closer
 to


basketball
 it
 possibly
 would
 be


overwhelming.
 The
 two
 games
 accomplish


different
 things
 for
 the
 viewer
 and
 they


both
 succeed
 in
 their
 own
 right.


>> There's
 really
 three
 types
 of
 televised


sports
 and
 one
 is
 this
 perpetual


hypnotic
 mesmerizing
 thing
 like


basketball,
 soccer,
 boxing,
 autoracing


to
 some
 degree
 where
 the
 action
 is


doesn't
 stop.
 Okay.
 And
 of
 course,
 in


the
 greatest
 moments
 of
 those
 sports,


it's
 electrifying
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 hard


to
 replicate.
 But
 there
 are
 also
 long


stretches
 where
 it
 becomes
 hypnotic
 in
 a


negative
 way
 that
 you
 kind
 of
 mentally


check
 out.
 Even
 a
 great
 NBA
 playoff
 game


at
 times
 will
 have
 a
 dull
 moment
 in
 the


second
 quarter
 or
 the
 third
 quarter.


Then
 there's
 also
 this
 category
 of


totally
 intellectual
 sports
 or
 cerebral


sports
 like
 baseball
 and
 golf
 where
 the


amount
 of
 action
 is
 tiny.
 Everyone
 knows


it,
 but
 everything
 you
 watch
 is
 the


thought
 process
 of
 what
 the
 meaning
 of


this
 is.
 And
 it's
 all
 kind
 of
 prologue


to
 the
 end.
 And
 you
 watch
 golf


particularly.
 You
 watch
 a
 guy
 think


about
 a
 shot
 he's
 going
 to
 take
 for
 90


seconds.
 He
 takes
 the
 shot.
 Then
 we
 have


two
 minutes
 of
 a
 discussion
 of
 what


happened
 with
 it.
 And
 he's
 walking
 to


the
 ball
 and
 what
 will
 he
 do
 next?
 And


then
 the
 third
 category
 is
 football


which
 is
 the
 second
 category
 most
 of
 the


time
 but
 imbued
 and
 injected
 with
 the


most
 intense
 example
 of
 that
 first


category.
 And
 it
 feels
 like
 the


strengths
 of
 both
 of
 those
 kind
 of


paradigms
 coales
 in
 this
 one
 thing.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 a
 big
 reason
 why
 it's
 so


different
 than
 anything
 else
 in
 terms


[music]
 of
 how
 it
 appeals
 to
 the


consumer.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[music]


Welcome
 back.
 This
 is
 the
 book
 review


podcast.
 I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz
 and
 I'm
 joined


this
 week
 by
 Chuck
 Clustermanman,
 author


of
 football.


Chuck,
 earlier
 in
 the
 conversation
 you


mentioned
 the
 idea
 that
 football
 is


somewhat
 conservative
 coded.
 We
 talked
 a


little
 bit
 about
 freedom
 versus
 control.


Do
 you
 see
 a
 connection
 between
 the


top-down
 corporate
 nature
 of
 modern


football
 and
 the
 way
 in
 which
 the


stereotypically
 conservative
 idea
 we've


had
 about
 the
 sport
 and
 about
 the


coaches
 and
 about
 the
 way
 that
 it
 is


run?
 Do
 those
 intersect
 in
 some
 way?


>> I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 so
 much
 that
 they


intersect,
 but
 they
 do
 sort
 of
 reflect


each
 other.
 And
 in
 the
 first
 example


when
 we're
 talking
 about
 the
 world
 at


large,
 these
 things
 are
 seen


fundamentally
 negative,
 right?
 The


description
 of
 how
 this
 would
 work
 seems


as
 though
 you
 know
 it
 is
 like
 top
 down


power
 and
 you
 wouldn't
 describe
 that
 to


someone
 and
 they'd
 be
 like
 what
 a


utopian
 scenario
 that
 is.
 You
 wouldn't


say
 that.
 But
 then
 when
 it
 actually


happens
 in
 football
 and
 we
 can
 watch
 it


like
 a
 simulation
 of
 it,
 a
 simulacrum
 of


it,
 then
 it's
 it's
 ideal.
 And
 in
 that


first
 category,
 we
 don't
 really
 have
 a


choice
 about
 it.
 It's
 like
 that's
 how


life
 is.
 We
 can't
 escape
 from
 it.
 I


guess
 you
 can
 try
 to
 Ted
 Kazinski
 and


escape
 from
 it,
 but
 not
 really.
 For
 if


you're
 going
 to
 live
 in
 society,
 you're


going
 to
 live
 by
 these
 rules
 and
 have
 to


accept
 that
 this
 is
 how
 the
 world
 works.


But
 then
 you
 can
 see
 it
 in
 football
 and


you
 can
 actually
 enjoy
 the
 the
 this
 like


you
 you
 can
 see
 it
 work
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is


a
 distraction,
 an
 entertainment,
 and


also
 something
 that
 can
 be
 real


important
 to
 you,
 but
 it's
 your
 choice.


You
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 watch
 it
 or
 not


watch
 it,
 to
 be
 involved
 or
 not


involved.
 you
 don't
 have
 this
 in
 life.


And
 I
 think
 anytime
 a
 game
 or
 some
 other


idiom
 of
 art
 or
 a
 book
 or
 any
 of
 these


things
 allows
 someone
 to
 think
 about
 how


the
 world
 actually
 is
 in
 a
 way
 that
 does


not
 seem
 as
 though
 it's
 almost
 forced


against
 their
 will.
 I
 think
 that
 helps


people
 understanding
 their
 life
 in
 a


way.
 They're
 able
 to
 see
 this
 thing
 and


not
 put
 themselves
 in
 it,
 but
 know
 in
 a


way
 that
 there's
 a
 reason
 this
 is


happening.
 the
 reason
 it's
 happening
 is


the
 same
 reason
 that
 whatever
 is


happening
 in
 your
 life
 is
 happening.


>> There's
 also
 related
 to
 this
 something


maybe
 you
 tell
 me
 if
 you
 think
 this
 is


true.
 Again,
 this
 is
 very
 odd
 for


something
 we
 considered
 to
 be
 the


American
 sport,
 but
 the
 sort
 of
 the


collective
 nature
 of
 football.
 the
 in
 a


way
 the
 anti-individual
 nature
 of


football
 as
 opposed
 to
 I
 think
 you
 say


this
 in
 your
 book
 as
 opposed
 to
 other


sports
 in
 which
 you
 really
 can
 get


invested
 in
 individuals
 in
 individual


achievement
 in
 names
 of
 players
 when


you're
 looking
 at
 football
 particularly


when
 just
 watching
 a
 game
 it
 is
 unless


you're
 betting
 on
 it
 or
 you're
 or
 you


have
 a
 fantasy
 team
 it
 is
 just
 a
 clash


of
 bodies
 two
 sides
 of
 bodies


>> and
 colors
 yeah
 and
 almost
 faceless


automatons
 in
 a
 way
 like
 the


quarterbacks
 are
 famous,
 but
 in
 many


ways
 the
 almost
 everyone
 else
 seems


interchangeable.
 If
 you
 don't
 really


have
 an
 understanding
 of
 their
 talent
 or


anything,
 it's
 like
 they're
 just
 a
 guy


comes
 in
 at
 offensive
 tackle
 and


replaces
 the
 previous
 offensive
 tackle.


It's
 very
 easy
 not
 to
 notice
 that
 at


all.
 And
 this,
 I
 think,
 is
 just
 like
 an


just
 a
 like
 an
 important
 irony.
 The
 NBA


has
 always
 emphasized
 this
 idea.
 It's


like,
 who's
 the
 face
 of
 the
 league?
 Who


are
 the
 stars?
 How
 do
 we
 get
 people
 to


to
 have
 a
 relationship
 with
 LeBron
 James


or
 with
 Steph
 Curry
 in
 baseball
 that's


happening
 now
 with
 Okconi,
 these
 ideas,


could
 this
 guy
 be
 a
 representation
 of


the
 league
 that
 little
 kids
 will
 see
 and


want
 to
 have
 a
 poster
 on
 their
 room
 and


all
 these
 things.
 And
 it's
 very


understandable
 because
 anytime
 you're


trying
 to
 sort
 of
 promote
 anything,
 you


want
 to
 promote
 the
 human
 aspect
 of
 it.


And
 yet,
 the
 reason
 football
 is
 so


dominant
 is
 because
 it
 is
 the
 opposite.


What
 people
 like
 about
 it
 are
 not
 the


individuals.
 It
 is
 the
 game.
 It
 is
 the


game
 itself.
 It
 is
 not
 there.
 There


isn't
 some
 way
 that
 that
 it
 can
 be
 sold


through
 like
 like
 a
 well,
 we're
 going to


we're
 going
 to
 convince
 people
 to
 become


invested
 in
 this
 guy.
 That
 happens
 every


so
 often,
 but
 not
 that
 much.
 The
 reason


football
 has
 been
 able
 to
 exist
 in
 this


way
 over
 time
 and
 just
 continually
 get


more
 popular
 is
 it's
 one
 of the
 few


things
 where
 it
 is
 devoid
 of
 need
 for


celebrity.
 It
 is
 the
 game
 itself.
 The


NFL
 will
 find
 guys
 for
 wearing
 the
 wrong


socks.
 They
 do
 not
 want
 individualism.


They're
 openly
 against
 it.
 The
 whole


idea
 of
 what
 a
 football
 coach
 tells
 you


is
 sublimate
 yourself.
 In
 the
 NCA


championship
 after
 the
 game,
 the


quarterback
 for
 Indiana
 is
 like,
 "I


would
 die
 for
 my
 team."
 He
 said
 this


twice
 that
 he
 would
 die
 for
 his


teammates.
 And
 now,
 of
 course,
 he


doesn't
 mean
 that
 literally,
 but
 in
 a


sense,
 he
 does.
 He's
 saying
 this
 is
 a
 a


reflection
 of
 my
 commitment
 that
 my
 life


does
 not
 mean
 as
 much
 as
 all
 our
 lives


together.
 And
 in
 every
 sport,
 every
 team


sport
 you
 have
 that
 element.
 But
 in


football,
 it
 actually
 is
 there
 in
 in
 the


sense
 that
 we
 all
 we
 all
 understand


this.
 Football
 is
 like
 the
 most
 pro


football
 at least
 like
 the
 most


successful
 extension
 of
 socialism
 there


is
 in
 the
 United
 States
 with
 revenue


sharing
 and
 how
 it
 has
 made
 the
 league


the
 what
 it
 is.
 It's
 just
 one
 of
 the


many
 sort
 of
 paradoxes
 that
 I
 was
 just


gonna
 say
 another
 contradiction
 and
 but


contradictions
 make
 things
 interesting


anytime
 you're
 talking
 about
 any
 subject


you
 know
 it's
 always
 you're
 making
 some


point
 about
 you
 know
 like
 what's


happening
 with
 HBO
 Max
 now
 or
 someone


say
 well
 that's
 kind
 of
 contradictory


because
 of
 this
 that
 well
 that's
 why


it's
 interesting
 like
 things
 that
 are


always
 like
 yep
 that's
 true
 and
 of


course
 that's
 true
 as
 well
 and
 that


extends
 to
 this
 thing
 that
 is
 a
 stayed


boring
 universe
 it
 has
 to
 be
 things
 that


demand
 cognitive
 dissonance
 from
 people


like
 it
 has
 to
 be
 there.
 We
 need
 that
 in


order
 to
 be
 electrified.


>> Do
 I
 actually
 need
 to
 get
 into
 fantasy


football
 or
 become
 a
 gambler
 in
 order
 to


care
 about
 football?
 Convert
 me.
 What


What
 do
 I
 need
 to
 do
 here?
 I
 feel
 like


I'm
 left
 out
 of
 a
 giant
 part
 of
 our


culture.
 I
 can't
 sit
 at
 an
 airport


chili's
 and
 talk
 to
 someone
 about
 the


Pful
 Everett
 novel
 I
 just
 read.
 They're


just
 going
 to
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 the
 hell


I'm
 talking
 about.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 closer


to
 people.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 closer
 to
 my


fellow
 country
 people.
 Help
 me
 out.


>> Well,
 okay,
 I'll
 say
 three
 things.


[snorts]
 One
 is


I
 don't
 think
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 convert


you
 and
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 should
 want
 to


be
 converted.
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 is


something
 that
 you
 should
 feel
 like
 I
 am


compelled
 to
 do
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 I


don't
 think
 in
 other
 aspects
 of
 your


life
 that
 you
 would
 be
 like,
 well,


everybody
 else
 thinks
 this,
 so
 I
 need
 to


think
 this,
 too.
 Or
 that's
 not
 how
 I


think
 you
 as
 a
 person
 operate.
 So,
 I


don't
 think
 you
 need
 to
 be
 converted.


Second
 of
 all,
 if
 you
 start
 gambling
 or


playing
 fantasy
 football,
 you
 will


become
 in
 some
 ways
 a
 low-level
 expert


on
 this,
 even
 if
 you
 don't
 watch
 the


games,
 because
 both
 of
 those
 things
 are


really
 perfectly
 set
 up
 for
 the
 casual


consumer.
 Like,
 you
 can
 win
 a
 fantasy


football
 league
 and
 never
 watch
 a
 game.


>> Gambling
 is
 set
 up
 to
 make
 almost
 every


proposition
 a
 50-50
 thing,
 but
 if
 you


start
 gambling
 and
 you
 start
 watching


that
 game,
 you're
 going
 to
 feel


something.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 many
 guys


now,
 like
 when
 I
 talk
 to
 dads,
 all
 our


kids
 are
 together,
 we're
 talking
 about


sports
 and
 inevitably
 gambling
 starts


coming
 up
 and
 you'll
 just
 hear
 a
 guy


saying
 like,
 "Oh
 yeah,
 you
 know,
 I
 was


there's
 kind
 of
 a
 dull
 NC
 State
 Boston


College
 game
 the
 other
 night
 and
 at


halftime
 though
 I
 went
 on
 my
 phone
 and
 I


made
 some
 bets
 just
 to
 feel
 something."


That's
 what
 it
 is.
 So
 like
 I'm
 going
 to


make
 myself
 feel
 like
 it's
 it
 sounds
 so


sad
 when
 you
 say,
 but
 yet
 at
 the
 same


time
 I
 know
 exactly
 what
 it
 means.


>> The
 third
 thing
 is
 and
 this
 is
 like
 the


last
 thing.
 Well,
 I
 kind
 of
 say
 about


this
 book.
 I
 do
 feel
 now
 I
 I I
 recognize


sort
 of
 the
 complexity
 of
 this.
 There


was
 a
 quote
 once
 by
 Getty
 Lee
 of
 Rush


and
 I
 just
 I
 always
 think
 of
 this
 and
 he


was
 like
 he
 said
 people
 into
 heavy
 metal


don't
 think
 Rush
 is
 a
 metal
 band
 and
 yet


people
 who
 hate
 heavy
 metal
 assume
 we


are
 a
 metal
 band.
 So
 I
 don't
 know
 who


our
 music
 is
 for.
 It
 is
 interesting
 with


this
 book
 because
 there
 are
 aspects
 of


this
 book
 that
 are
 very
 much
 for
 people


who
 like
 have
 thought
 about
 football


their
 whole
 life
 and
 there
 are
 sections


for
 people
 who
 maybe
 only
 know
 that


football
 is
 popular.
 Now,
 would
 it
 have


been
 better
 to
 go
 more
 in
 one
 of
 the
 two


directions?
 But
 that's
 not
 how
 I
 am.
 I


am
 one
 kind
 of
 person
 who
 thinks
 a
 lot


about
 that
 other
 kind
 of
 person
 and
 I'm


trying
 to
 go
 right
 down
 the
 middle
 and


we'll
 see
 what
 happens.
 But
 I
 think
 if


you
 were
 able
 to
 read
 this
 book
 and


enjoy
 it,
 to
 me
 that's
 a
 relief
 to
 me


and
 a
 and
 a
 good
 thing
 in
 the
 same
 way


that
 if
 I
 talked
 to
 an
 NFL
 scout
 and


they
 said
 like,
 "I
 like
 this
 book."
 I


would
 feel
 good
 about
 that,
 too.


>> Well,
 I
 was
 appreciative
 for
 some
 of
 the


footnotes.
 I
 [laughter]
 was
 like,
 "What


is
 this
 Lamar
 Jackson
 play
 that
 you
 keep


referring
 to?"
 Thankfully,
 there's
 a


footnote
 here.
 You've
 written
 two


novels,
 Downtown
 Owl
 and
 The
 Visible


Man,
 but
 you're
 primarily
 a
 writer
 of


non-fiction.
 And
 we
 are
 in
 a
 moment


where
 the
 non-fiction
 book
 appears,
 just


based
 on
 the
 numbers,
 to
 be
 in
 a
 bit
 of


a
 decline.
 We
 at
 the
 Times
 Book
 Review


reported
 that
 in
 2025,
 non-fiction
 sales


were
 only
 down
 about
 2%
 from
 the
 year


prior,
 but
 that's
 only
 because
 of
 some


huge
 titles
 from
 the
 past
 few
 years
 that


have
 continued
 to
 sell.
 from
 the


perspective
 of
 an
 author
 who
 has
 been


publishing
 for
 more
 than
 two
 decades,


but
 also
 as
 Chuck
 Lerman,
 someone
 who


thinks
 about
 media
 consumption,
 who


thinks
 about
 the
 way
 in
 which
 people


interact
 with
 culture.
 What
 have
 you


observed
 about
 non-fiction
 publishing
 in


particular?


>> When
 I
 got
 into
 this,
 when
 I
 first


started
 publishing
 books
 in
 like
 2001,


kind
 of
 what
 the
 anecdotal
 thing
 people


were
 saying
 is
 we're
 in
 a
 non-fiction


era
 now.
 It's
 like
 like
 fiction
 is


really
 hard
 to
 even
 get
 published.
 this


is
 a
 non-fictional
 world.
 Now,


statistically,
 it
 seems
 the
 complete


opposite.
 It
 seems
 like
 like
 a
 lot
 of


publishing
 houses
 are
 carried
 by


especially
 books
 that
 are
 geared
 toward


female
 audiences
 that
 they
 really
 they


haul
 all
 the
 water
 for
 everyone.
 And


then
 the
 p
 the
 assessment
 then
 people


make
 is
 men
 just
 don't
 read
 books


anymore.
 Men
 used
 to
 read
 non-fiction


and
 now
 they
 don't.
 What
 is
 interesting


is
 it's
 possible
 that
 men
 are
 not


reading
 books
 the
 way
 they
 used
 to,
 but


they're
 not
 reading
 less.
 I
 think,
 and


this
 is
 real
 key,


we're
 reading
 all
 day
 now.


>> Sure.
 Sure.


>> Constantly.
 Like
 I
 probably
 the
 number


of
 minutes
 in
 a
 day
 that
 I
 read


something
 I
 suspect
 is
 higher
 than
 it's


ever
 been
 in
 my
 life,
 a
 ton
 of
 it
 is


entirely
 shallow,
 concise,
 a
 limited
 two


sentence
 thing.
 But
 if
 you
 read
 all
 day,


the
 aggregate
 of
 that
 sort
 of
 takes
 away


like
 the
 desire
 to
 read
 for
 pleasure.


it.
 There
 are
 people
 who
 say
 things


like,
 "I
 hate
 writing,
 but
 I
 love
 having


written."
 In
 some
 ways,
 I'm
 not
 like


that
 at
 all.
 I
 like
 writing.
 Publishing


is
 the
 part
 that
 I
 don't
 like
 in
 some


ways,
 but
 I
 like
 having
 read
 in
 a
 way


more
 than
 reading.
 I
 don't
 I've
 when
 I


was
 a
 young
 person
 though,
 I
 loved
 that


experience
 so
 much.
 I
 would
 like
 escape


from
 the
 world
 to
 read
 a
 book.
 It


doesn't
 feel
 that
 way
 to
 me
 now.
 And
 I


assume
 it
 is
 because
 I
 am
 sort
 of
 forced


or
 the
 way
 the
 world
 works
 to
 just
 read


constantly.
 So
 then
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day
 before
 I
 go
 to
 sleep
 a
 time
 that


maybe
 in
 the
 1970s
 that's
 when
 I
 read


Jonathan
 Livingston
 seagull
 or
 whatever


what
 I
 would
 ever
 be
 reading
 then
 you


know
 now
 there
 are
 things
 on
 television


that
 fulfill
 that
 role
 like
 the
 and
 this


really
 changed
 like
 with
 the
 Sopranos


and
 Madmen
 and
 those
 shows
 and
 we
 don't


really
 have
 shows
 actually
 that
 good


anymore
 like
 Plurbus
 is
 the
 only
 one


that's
 in
 that
 class
 where
 but
 if
 you're


watching
 Plurbus
 now
 it
 is
 very
 similar


to
 the
 experience
 of
 reading
 a
 novel
 in


a
 lot
 of
 ways
 except
 it's
 a
 passive


experience.
 So
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 read


about
 the
 character
 and
 imagine
 what
 she


looks
 like.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 do
 that.


They're
 giving
 me
 that
 and
 I
 can
 just


think
 about
 the
 content
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is


not
 like
 a
 it
 it
 doesn't
 really
 drain
 my


mind
 in
 any
 way.
 It
 just
 and
 I
 think
 for


a
 lot
 of
 people
 they're
 like
 this
 is
 the


reading
 I'm
 doing.
 This
 is
 I'm
 It's
 not


a
 book,
 but
 I'm
 reading
 this
 thing
 on


television
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm
 that


different
 than
 it.
 Plus,
 as
 somebody
 who


like
 who
 likes
 sports
 now,
 okay,
 or


always
 has
 like
 sports,
 but
 what
 I'm


saying
 is
 there
 was
 a
 time
 when
 there


was
 a
 limited
 amount
 of
 sports
 you
 could


consume.
 When
 I
 was
 a
 This
 is
 so
 crazy


now,
 but
 like
 in
 the
 1980s,
 there
 was


often
 one
 college
 football
 game
 on
 a


week
 for
 everyone.
 That
 was
 the
 only


game.
 There
 would
 be
 like
 a
 game
 on
 ABC.


Maybe
 there'd
 be
 two
 games
 on
 Saturday,


but
 there
 wasn't
 like
 wall-to-wall
 games


on
 ESPN.
 Now
 there's
 football
 on
 every


day
 of
 the
 week.
 So
 if
 you're
 a
 person


who
 in
 the
 past
 was
 really
 looked


forward
 to
 that
 one
 college
 game
 and


like
 maybe
 the
 three
 NFL
 games
 you
 could


watch,
 now
 you
 have
 30
 games
 you
 can


watch.
 When
 I
 was
 a
 kid,
 I
 wanted
 to
 see


every
 game.
 I'm
 an
 adult.
 I
 want
 to
 see


every
 game,
 but
 now
 there
 are
 30.
 That's


like
 how
 much
 time
 do
 I
 like?
 It
 is.
 I


am
 so
 embarrassed
 about
 the
 amount
 of


imaginations
 I
 go
 through
 in
 order
 to


see
 football
 games
 that
 I
 have
 to
 see


that
 I
 will
 forget
 in
 48
 hours.


[laughter]


I
 have
 I'll
 make
 up
 all
 these
 weird


excuses
 or
 I'll
 plan
 my
 life
 around


things.
 I
 record
 so
 many
 games
 and
 then


when
 my
 wife
 falls
 asleep,
 I'm
 watching


these
 college
 football
 games
 at
 midnight


or
 whatever
 that
 that
 if
 you
 asked
 me


about
 why
 I
 wanted
 to
 watch
 it
 or
 what


happened
 later,
 I'd
 be
 like,
 I
 vaguely


remember,
 but
 they
 all
 blur
 together.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 it
 is.
 It
 is
 like
 an


addictive
 thing.
 Although,
 I
 guess
 it's


not
 really
 a
 horrific
 addiction
 because


it
 just
 means
 I
 watch
 something
 that


doesn't
 necessarily
 change
 my
 life.


You're
 not
 harming
 anyone
 else


hypothetically.
 You're
 not
 harming


yourself
 even.


>> So,
 how
 do
 you
 consume
 information
 now?


Like
 non-fiction.
 Do
 you
 find
 that?
 Are


you
 still
 reading
 non-fiction
 books?
 Are


you
 listening
 to
 more
 non-fiction


podcast?
 How
 are
 you
 learning
 about


things
 now?


>> I
 don't
 feel
 like
 I'm
 underinformed


compared
 to
 how
 I
 was
 in
 the
 past.
 And


yet,
 it's
 very
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 explain


how
 that
 process
 is
 going
 on.


>> There's
 this
 book,
 Blank
 Space,
 now
 by


this
 guy
 named
 Mark.
 I'm
 reading
 this


book
 now,
 you
 know.
 So
 I
 read
 those


books
 still
 for
 what
 I
 do
 as
 a
 writer.
 I


am
 constantly
 reading
 non-fiction
 books


in
 a
 weird
 way
 though.
 I'm
 not
 reading


them
 cover
 to
 cover.
 I'm
 reading
 the


parts
 I
 need.
 So
 it's
 I
 feel
 it's
 like
 a


utilitarian
 thing.
 I
 suppose
 what
 is


happening
 is
 the
 algorithms
 that
 dictate


social
 media
 of
 course
 respond
 to
 the


other
 things
 that
 we
 read.
 And
 during


the
 day
 I
 look
 at
 news.
 I
 look
 at
 news


and
 I
 look
 at
 sports.
 So
 I'm
 just


getting
 it
 fed
 constantly.
 And
 anytime


that
 you
 see
 something
 interesting,
 you


then
 of
 course
 now
 have
 the
 process
 of


what
 is
 this
 real?
 Like
 what
 element
 of


this
 is
 real?
 What
 is
 this?
 Is
 this


journalism
 or
 is
 this
 activism?
 So
 you


have
 to
 basically
 investigate
 the
 thing


that
 you
 absorb
 and
 through
 that


investigation
 you
 become
 informed.
 Also


this
 really
 started
 I
 think
 even
 before


social
 media
 but
 now
 is
 very
 true.
 This


is
 even
 true
 for
 people
 who
 aren't
 on


social
 media.
 It
 seems
 as
 though
 every


person
 I
 know
 who's
 smart
 has
 become
 a


special
 interest
 newspaper
 that
 every


time
 I
 talk
 to
 someone,
 they
 want
 to


break
 news
 to
 me.
 It
 is
 crazy
 how
 like,


oh,
 something's
 going
 to
 happen
 with


Greenland.
 How
 fast
 I
 find
 out
 about


that,
 even
 if
 I'm
 not
 trying.
 It's
 just


it
 is
 crazy.
 And
 I'm
 I
 think
 I'm
 the


same
 way.
 You
 learn
 something


interesting.
 Oh,
 I'm
 going
 to
 text
 these


two
 friends
 and
 they'll
 be
 interested,


too.
 It
 is
 almost
 as
 though
 we're
 just


flooded
 with
 a
 ton
 of
 bad
 information


with
 some
 good
 information
 inside
 of


that
 and
 having
 to
 drill
 down
 and
 find


it
 is
 how
 you
 become
 informed.


It
 is
 a
 mystery
 in
 a
 way
 like
 sometimes


I
 will
 know
 a
 new
 book
 is
 coming
 out
 or


I'll
 know
 a
 new
 record
 is
 about
 to
 be


released
 and
 I'll
 be
 like
 how
 did
 I
 know


this?
 I
 remember
 reading
 Entertainment


Weekly
 in
 the
 90s
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things


about
 that
 was
 that
 like
 you
 go
 to
 the


book
 page
 and
 here
 are
 the
 14
 big
 books


coming
 out
 this
 week
 and
 you
 go
 to
 the


music
 section
 here
 are
 all
 the
 new


records
 here
 are
 all
 the
 and
 it
 was


wasn't
 even
 I
 didn't
 it
 was
 almost
 it


had
 less
 to
 do
 with
 what
 they
 were


saying
 about
 these
 things
 but
 just
 the


fact
 is
 here's
 the
 list
 okay
 here's
 the


list
 of
 all
 these
 things
 and
 now
 there's


that
 doesn't
 that's
 how
 it
 is
 this
 book


for
 example
 the
 biggest
 obstacle
 as
 far


as
 I
 can
 tell
 is
 having
 people
 know
 that


it
 exists
 at
 all.
 It's
 not
 that
 I
 can't


convince
 them
 that
 it's
 good
 or
 that


it's
 worth
 the
 price
 or
 that
 they're


enough
 of
 a
 football
 fan
 to
 enjoy
 or
 it


doesn't
 really
 matter.
 All
 these
 things


they
 seem
 secondary
 to
 just
 somehow


convincing
 them
 or
 not
 convincing
 them,


explaining
 to
 them
 that
 it's
 something


that
 can
 be
 purchased.


>> Yeah.
 And
 the
 only
 way
 to
 do
 it


apparently
 is
 to
 just
 flood
 the
 zone
 and


do
 all
 of
 these
 podcasts
 and
 do
 every


interview
 I'm
 asked
 about
 and
 do
 I
 mean


the
 only
 way.
 It
 feels
 real
 weird.
 It


feels
 completely
 detached
 from
 being
 a


writer.
 Yeah.
 In
 2001
 when
 I
 started
 it


was
 like
 the
 it
 was
 like
 the
 publishing


house
 told
 you
 like
 what
 media
 you
 would


do.
 They
 would
 come
 to
 you
 and
 be
 like,


"Oh,
 the
 Chicago
 Tribune
 wants
 to
 talk


to
 you
 and
 I
 think
 you
 should
 do
 it
 or


whatever."
 And
 then
 you'd
 wait
 and
 you


now
 the
 expectation
 is
 you
 better
 do


this
 yourself.


>> I
 know
 it
 helps
 to
 be
 an
 entertaining


podcast
 guest.
 I
 understand
 that
 you


like
 it
 it's
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 the
 doesn't


change
 the
 book
 at
 all
 with
 between
 the


covers
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 like
 going
 and


I
 do
 wonder
 what
 it
 must
 be
 like
 for
 the


true
 genius
 writer
 who
 just
 can't
 talk


to
 people.


>> Absolutely.
 How
 many
 people
 knew
 that


there
 was
 a
 new
 Thomas
 Pinchan
 novel


last
 fall?
 Maybe
 he's
 a
 bad
 example


because
 he's
 one
 of
 the


>> Okay,
 it's
 a
 great
 example.
 I
 did.
 How


did
 I
 know
 that?
 I
 I'm
 not
 exactly
 even


sure
 how
 that
 happened.
 Who
 was
 the


person
 who
 told
 me
 that?
 Because
 I
 think


even
 just
 say
 five
 years
 ago
 or
 six


years
 ago
 like
 Twitter
 was
 different
 and


you
 would
 say,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to


follow
 these
 people
 and
 these
 are
 the


people
 who
 are
 going
 to
 be
 served
 as
 the


people
 who
 tell
 me."
 But
 now
 that's
 not


the
 way
 it
 works.
 It's
 like
 a
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 were
 on
 Twitter
 like
 they


aren't
 anymore.
 They've
 went
 to
 a


different
 and
 because
 there's
 all
 these


different
 sort
 of
 silos
 like
 blue
 sky


and
 mastadon
 and
 threads
 and
 all
 these


things.
 It's
 you
 things
 can
 be
 happening


in
 huge
 in
 one
 and
 completely
 unknown
 in


the
 other.


>> Absolutely.
 When
 you
 talk
 about
 going
 to


the
 book
 pages
 and
 EW,
 which
 is
 where
 I


started
 my
 career
 in
 New
 York
 City


publishing,
 working
 as
 a
 books
 assistant


at
 Entertainment
 Weekly,
 one
 of
 the
 best


jobs
 I
 still
 have
 ever
 had,
 or
 when
 I


was
 younger
 reading
 Spin
 magazine,


seeing
 who's
 on
 the
 cover
 going
 to
 the


review
 pages,
 it
 was
 an
 active
 thing.
 I


feel
 like
 what
 you're
 talking
 about
 is


almost
 there's
 just
 there's
 information


in
 the
 air
 and
 it's
 passive.
 I'm
 just


receiving
 it
 through
 alerts
 in
 my
 phone


and
 I
 see
 it
 mentioned
 on
 Instagram
 and


I'm
 looking
 at
 headlines
 and
 I'm
 not


searching
 anything
 out
 but
 it's
 coming


to
 me
 in
 some
 ways
 and
 some
 of
 that


stuff
 is
 very
 it's
 great
 to
 know
 that


everyone
 is
 into
 geese
 in
 the
 past
 I


would
 have
 there
 would
 have
 been
 a
 place


where
 I
 specifically
 read
 a
 profile
 or
 a


review
 of
 that
 band
 and
 then
 I
 would


have
 been
 into
 it


>> and
 not
 just
 that
 but
 it's
 like
 the


thing
 like
 Geese
 for
 example
 it's
 like


all
 the
 things
 happen
 at
 once
 you


hearing
 about
 the
 and
 hearing
 what


people
 react
 to
 it
 and
 the
 band
 itself


you
 all
 kind
 of
 learn
 about
 in
 the
 same


time.
 Like
 talking
 about
 Spin,
 man,
 I


remember
 reading
 about
 the
 band


Pavement.
 Initially
 being
 amused
 that
 a


band
 was
 called
 Pavement,
 reading
 about


them
 just
 being
 rapodic
 about
 it
 and


then
 being
 like,
 I
 wonder
 if
 I
 would
 be


into
 this.
 I'm
 reading
 what
 the
 guy
 says


and
 the
 way
 he
 describes
 it
 seems
 like


maybe
 I'll
 love
 it.
 Maybe
 it'll
 repel
 me


going
 to
 the
 record
 store.
 They
 don't


have
 it
 yet
 because
 it
 turns
 out
 that


they
 spin
 reviewed
 it
 like
 six
 weeks


before
 it
 came
 out
 because
 that's
 how
 it


was.
 So
 then
 waiting
 for
 it,
 then


finally
 getting
 it.
 Then
 thinking
 back


to
 what
 was
 described
 to
 me
 in
 the


actual
 experience
 and
 how
 those
 things


are
 similar
 or
 different
 or
 maybe


hearing
 things
 because
 it
 was
 described


to
 me
 that
 improve
 the
 experience
 that
 I


wouldn't
 have
 even
 recognized
 if
 I
 had


just
 played
 it
 is
 very
 weird.
 A
 friend


of
 mine
 is
 back
 home
 with
 at
 her
 parents


house
 now
 and
 she's
 going
 through
 all


her
 old
 stuff.
 And
 there
 was
 this
 book


that
 came
 out
 in
 2001
 or
 2002.
 It
 was


like
 a
 I
 think
 it
 was
 called
 Or
 Not
 to


Be.
 It
 was
 a
 collection
 of
 suicide


notes.
 Someone
 had
 put
 a
 book
 together


of
 just
 various
 suicide
 notes.
 And
 when


I
 had
 met
 this
 woman,
 we
 had
 bonded


over.
 We
 both
 had
 this
 book.
 And
 she


found
 this
 book
 and
 we
 was,
 "Haha,


remember
 this."
 And
 then
 we
 were
 like,


you
 know,
 how
 did
 we
 find
 that
 book?
 Did


we
 just
 go
 into
 like
 a
 media
 play
 or
 a


Barnes
 &
 Noble
 and
 walk
 around
 and
 come


across
 it?
 Did
 GQ
 or
 Esquire
 or


something
 write
 about
 it?
 We
 read
 the


same
 artic
 because
 it's
 such
 an
 odd


thing,
 right?


Now


they
 got
 to
 know
 the
 title
 author
 and


that
 is
 part
 of
 the
 complexity.


>> Is
 that
 why
 you
 named
 it
 just
 football?


>> Technically
 that
 was
 a
 mistake
 right


because
 they
 say
 I
 guess
 the
 SEO
 or


whatever
 that
 you'll
 never
 it'll
 never


come
 up.


>> If
 I'm
 googling
 the
 title
 of
 your
 book


shoot
 there's
 all
 this
 other
 stuff.


>> I
 called
 it
 football
 because
 that's
 what


it's
 about.
 That
 wasn't
 the
 original


title.
 There
 was
 a
 bunch
 of
 titles
 and


then
 there
 was
 a
 bunch
 of
 subtitles.
 But


then
 at
 some
 point
 I
 was
 like
 I'm
 just


gonna
 say
 what
 it
 is.
 Like
 I
 want
 this


to
 I
 I
 just
 even
 the
 let's
 feel
 like
 the


subtitle
 in in
 non-fiction
 is
 often
 much


more
 important
 than
 the
 title.


>> They're
 so
 long
 because
 you
 have
 to
 fit


in
 all
 that
 this
 these
 are
 three
 things


that
 the
 book
 is
 about
 or
 what
 have
 you.


>> And
 they
 end
 up
 completely
 warping
 what


the
 book
 is
 about,
 the
 perception
 of
 the


book.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 people
 see
 that
 subtitle,
 they're


going
 to
 read
 every
 line
 in
 that
 book


through
 the
 lens
 that
 this
 is
 what
 the


intention
 is.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 I'm
 going


to
 take
 that
 away.
 I'm
 because
 I'm
 going


to
 take
 away
 I
 don't
 want
 people
 to
 be


like,
 "Oh,
 it's
 a
 book
 about
 football,


but
 it's
 really
 about
 this.
 What
 it


really
 is
 is
 the
 title."
 That's
 what
 it


is.
 And
 also,
 I
 just
 I
 also
 thought,


okay,
 so
 Walter
 Camp,
 the
 godfather
 of


football
 or
 whatever,
 he
 wrote
 a
 book


called
 Football
 in
 the
 late
 19th


century.
 And
 it's
 as
 close
 to
 a
 Bible
 of


football
 there
 is.
 It's
 all
 the
 rules
 of


football,
 what
 they
 should
 be,
 all
 the


strategies,
 also
 stuff
 about
 Napoleon


and
 like
 football's
 relationship
 to


warfare
 and
 all
 these
 things.
 It's
 kind


of
 interesting
 this
 book
 that
 came
 out


just
 football.
 And
 then
 I
 was
 like,
 I


wonder
 who
 else
 has
 written
 a
 book
 just


called
 football
 in
 the
 20th
 century.
 And


there
 was
 really
 nothing.
 So
 I
 was
 like,


>> it's
 mine.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 going
 to
 not
 just
 mine,
 but


like
 this
 is
 in
 some
 ways
 it
 is
 a
 way
 to


pay
 homage.
 I'm
 interested
 in
 the


history
 of
 sport
 where
 this
 is
 like
 a


connecting
 back
 to
 it.
 And
 also
 it's
 it


is
 a
 little
 bit
 it
 is
 a
 little
 bit


audacious
 maybe
 to
 just
 do
 it.
 I
 always


think
 that
 there
 was
 that
 movie
 that


Noah
 Bombbeck
 movie
 marriage
 story.


>> That's
 a
 different
 movie
 if
 it's
 called


a
 marriage
 story.
 But
 by
 calling
 it


Marriage
 Story,
 it
 means
 that
 this
 is


what
 happens
 in
 marriages.
 When
 Lena


Dunham
 made
 girls,
 okay,
 if
 that
 show


had
 been
 called
 Hannah,
 and
 it
 was
 like,


oh,
 it's
 about
 this
 character.
 That's


very
 different.
 By
 calling
 it
 Girls,
 it


did
 take
 on
 a
 deeper
 meaning
 and
 was
 a


bolder
 move.
 And
 now,
 you
 don't
 want
 to


be
 bold
 just
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 boldness,


but
 I'm
 attracted
 to
 that
 gamble.
 Yeah.


>> Like,
 this
 isn't
 one
 of
 many
 books
 about


football.
 This
 is
 its
 own
 thing.
 I
 hope.


>> Well,
 Chuck,
 to
 the
 dismay
 of
 some
 in
 my


life,
 I
 may
 actually
 start
 watching
 a


tiny
 bit
 more
 football
 as
 a
 result
 of


reading
 this
 book,
 as
 a
 result
 of
 our


conversation.


>> Well,
 Roger
 Goodell,
 thanks
 you.


>> It's
 It's
 been
 a
 delight
 to
 have
 you
 on.


Thanks
 for
 coming
 on
 the
 Book
 Review


Podcast.


>> Oh,
 my
 pleasure.


>> That
 was
 my
 conversation
 with
 Chuck


Clustermanman
 about
 his
 book
 Football.


I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz,
 editor
 of
 the
 New
 York


Times
 book
 review.
 Football
 Curious
 is


how
 I
 would
 describe
 myself.
