CZ,
 welcome
 to
 the
 All-In
 podcast.


>> Well,
 thanks
 for
 having
 me
 here.


>> It's
 really,
 really
 great
 to
 see
 you.


>> It's
 a
 pleasure,
 Hannah.


>> I
 want
 to
 go
 all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 the


beginning
 because
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 don't
 really
 know
 your
 background


the
 way
 that
 they
 probably
 should.
 The


part
 of
 the
 background
 that
 I
 really


care
 about
 is
 there's
 parts
 of
 your


early
 journey
 in
 Canada,
 which
 is
 very


similar
 to
 mine.
 You
 worked
 at


McDonald's.
 I
 worked
 at
 Burger
 King.


>> Okay.


>> But
 before
 that,
 your
 parents
 were
 able


to
 immigrate
 from
 China
 right
 around


Tanen
 Square,
 right?
 My
 father
 went
 to


you
 uh
 Canada
 to
 study
 in
 1984.
 That's


five
 years
 before
 tan
 square.


>> How
 did
 that
 come
 about?
 So
 your
 father


stayed
 in
 Canada
 once
 he
 went
 there
 or


no?


>> Uh
 he
 he
 could
 visit
 us
 every
 twice
 a


year
 basically
 but
 he
 would
 most
 of
 the


time
 he
 was
 in
 Canada


>> and
 um
 yeah
 so


>> and
 he
 was
 a
 teacher
 in
 China.


>> He
 was
 a
 teacher
 professor.
 He
 was
 a


professor
 in
 China
 and
 then
 he
 went
 to


do
 a
 exchange
 program
 in
 University
 of


Toronto
 first.


>> Uhhuh.
 And
 then
 uh
 a
 couple
 years
 later


he
 moved
 to
 UBC
 University
 of
 Brit
 Brit


British
 Columbia
 in
 Vancouver.
 And
 then


he
 was
 there.
 We
 were
 applying
 back
 back


then
 it's
 actually
 very
 difficult
 to
 get


a
 passport.
 It
 takes
 like
 three
 or
 four


years
 to
 get
 a
 passport.
 We
 started


applying
 in
 1985
 fiveish.
 It
 took
 like


two
 three
 years
 to
 get
 a
 passport
 and


then
 uh
 after
 you
 get
 a
 passport


>> meaning
 a
 Chinese
 passport.


>> A
 Chinese
 passport.
 Yeah.
 So
 um
 and
 then


it
 takes
 like
 another
 few
 years
 to
 get
 a


visa.
 Like
 that's
 just
 how
 long
 the


process
 takes
 back
 then.
 And
 then
 uh


yeah,
 so
 we
 got
 it
 shortly
 after
 uh
 in


18
 uh
 1989.


>> When
 you
 look
 back,
 it
 almost
 seems


fortuitous.
 Isn't
 there
 a
 version
 where


post
 tan
 men
 they
 kind
 of
 just
 shut


everything
 down
 and
 say,
 "Okay,
 let's


just
 reset
 and
 then
 maybe
 they
 wouldn't


have
 approved
 the
 visa
 or


>> No,
 actually
 after
 that
 the
 visa
 got


easier.
 The
 passports
 like
 that
 got


harder."
 So
 they
 they
 don't
 they
 no


longer
 issue
 new
 passport
 like
 the


reissue
 of
 new
 passports
 got
 harder.
 But


we
 we
 were
 lucky.
 So
 we
 got
 the


passports
 like
 you
 know
 like
 maybe
 a


year
 before
 that
 and
 then
 we're
 waiting


for
 the
 visa
 and
 then
 afterwards
 the


visa
 got
 easier.
 So
 in
 some
 ways
 that


actually
 kind
 of
 helped
 us
 to
 get
 to
 get


the
 visa.
 Wow.


>> Yeah.
 In
 some
 really
 weird
 way.


>> Did
 that
 event
 shape
 your
 perspective
 in


any
 way
 shape
 or
 form
 or
 not
 really?


Were
 you
 too
 young
 or
 no?
 You
 were
 what


12?


>> I
 was
 12.
 So
 I
 think
 consciously
 no.
 uh


this
 it
 didn't
 change
 me
 that
 much
 but
 I


subconsciously
 I
 think
 you
 know
 there


were
 discussions
 about
 know
 democracy


versus
 um
 so
 there's
 some
 discussions
 I


was
 actually
 living
 on
 a
 university


campus
 back
 then
 uh
 the
 China
 the


Chinese
 the
 China
 science
 and
 technology


universities
 one
 of
 the
 top
 four


universities
 in
 China
 so
 there
 were
 a


lot
 of
 discussions
 among
 the
 university


students
 which
 were
 older
 like
 which


were
 probably
 seven
 to
 nine
 years
 older


than
 me
 so
 there
 were
 some
 discussions


but
 I'm
 I
 was
 12
 so
 um
 I
 wasn't
 really


clued
 into
 it
 but
 I
 think
 subconsciously


It
 may
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 a
 subconscious


impact.
 I
 don't
 know.


>> And
 what
 was
 it
 like
 when
 you
 you
 moved


to
 Vancouver?


>> I
 moved
 to
 Vancouver.
 Yeah.


>> So
 you
 land
 in
 British
 Columbia.


>> Yeah.


>> In
 Vancouver.
 It's
 like
 a
 different


>> It's
 just
 different.


>> It's
 very
 different.
 It's
 very


different.
 Um
 it's
 just
 a
 completely
 new


country
 and
 then
 uh


>> did
 you
 know
 English
 at
 all
 or
 No,


>> I
 studied
 English
 for
 like
 couple
 years


in
 in
 school
 but
 you
 know
 I
 was
 not


fluent
 at
 all.
 But
 yeah,
 Vancouver
 is


great.
 Canada
 is
 you
 know
 nice
 green


nice
 greenery.
 um
 open
 space.
 Uh


everything's
 pretty
 uh
 the
 living


standard
 is
 high.
 Everything's
 pretty


pretty
 good.
 Um
 everything
 is
 very


clean.
 Uh
 the
 fruits
 are
 bigger.
 Um
 so


>> it's
 it's
 just
 a
 really
 nice


environment.
 Yeah.


>> Did
 both
 your
 parents
 work
 when
 the


family
 was
 reunited?
 What
 do
 they
 do?


>> Uh
 so
 my
 father
 stayed
 uh
 was
 like


assistant
 professor
 in
 the
 in
 the
 in
 the


un
 university.
 He
 gets
 like
 a thousand


Canadian
 dollars
 per
 month
 of
 like
 I


don't
 know
 what
 do
 you
 call
 it?


>> Like
 a
 stipent.


>> Like
 a
 stipent.


>> Yeah.
 We
 get
 some
 like
 really
 lowcost


house
 housing
 with
 the
 the
 faculty


housing
 from
 uh
 UBC.
 So
 we
 lived
 on


campus.
 Uh
 we
 I
 think
 on
 the
 third
 day


of
 our
 arrival
 in
 Canada,
 my
 mom
 went
 to


a
 factory
 sewing
 factory
 to
 work
 like


sewing
 clothes.
 Uh
 she
 was
 a
 math
 and


history
 teacher
 in
 China,
 but
 she


doesn't
 speak
 that
 much
 English.
 So
 she


couldn't
 get
 the
 same
 level
 of
 jobs
 and


she
 basically
 can
 only
 work
 at
 a
 minimum


wage
 factory.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 she
 did
 that
 for
 like
 seven
 10
 years.


Um
 and
 yeah
 so
 she
 she
 just
 worked


there.


>> My
 mom
 was
 a
 nurse
 in
 Sri
 Lanka
 and
 when


we
 immigrated
 when
 we
 got
 refugee
 status


>> my
 father
 was
 unemployed.


>> Yeah


>> and
 my
 mom
 became
 a
 housekeeper


>> and
 that's
 what
 she
 did
 and
 then
 she


became
 like
 a
 nurse's
 aid
 and
 and
 then
 I


think
 when
 I
 was
 like
 14
 is
 when
 I
 got


my
 first
 job.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 got
 my
 first
 job
 at


McDonald's
 at
 I
 think
 it's
 14
 or
 15.
 I


think
 it
 was
 15.


>> 14.
 Yeah.


>> We're
 the
 same
 age
 so
 it
 probably
 would


have
 been
 14.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 Do


you
 remember
 what
 the
 minimum
 wage
 was


in
 British
 Columbia
 that


>> I
 do.
 Uh
 the
 minimum
 wage
 was
 $6,
 but


McDonald's


>> Oh,
 that's
 incredible.
 In
 Ontario,
 it


was
 455.


>> So,
 but
 in
 McDonald's,
 they
 pay
 450.


That's
 below
 minimum
 wage


>> because
 the
 McDonald's
 somehow
 had
 like


a
 special
 exemption
 because
 they
 a
 lot


of
 young
 kids
 work
 there.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 um
 so,
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 was
 on
 my
 14th


birthday
 that
 I
 applied
 for
 the
 job
 and


then
 a
 week
 later
 I
 was
 flipping
 burgers


there.
 Um
 and
 it
 was
 the
 first
 income
 I


had.
 You're
 not
 like
 this
 precocious


technical
 wonder
 kid
 who's
 coding
 247


and
 learning
 computer
 science
 or
 were


you?


>> Uh
 no
 I
 wouldn't
 describe
 me
 as
 that.
 I


think
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 technical
 guy.
 Uh
 I


started
 computer
 science.
 I
 was
 learning


pro
 I
 was
 interested
 in
 programming
 even


in
 high
 school.
 Um
 but
 I
 wasn't
 a


programming
 wizard.
 Uh
 I
 wasn't
 like
 you


know
 one
 of
 those
 really
 genius
 coders.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 think
 I'm
 a
 decent
 coder.
 Uh
 I
 think
 I


I
 wrote
 some
 decent
 code
 in
 my
 in
 my


career
 and
 then
 um
 when
 I
 was
 like
 third


20
 28
 30-ish
 I
 moved
 away
 from
 coding.
 I


was
 like
 doing
 more
 business
 development


um
 sales
 and
 etc.
 So
 there
 was
 like


maybe
 I
 would
 say
 80
 years
 of
 my
 career.


>> So
 you're
 a
 normal
 immigrant
 kid


learning
 to
 adapt
 in
 Canada.


>> Yeah.


>> Did
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 friends?


>> Yeah,
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 friends.
 I
 had
 a
 um


my


>> only
 Asian
 friends
 or
 No,


>> both.
 I
 actually
 had
 like
 both
 Asian
 and


non-Asian
 friends.
 Uh
 but
 uh
 uh
 I
 was


actually
 in
 our
 school
 most
 of the


Asians
 hang
 out
 with
 Asians
 but
 I
 was


actually
 one
 of
 the
 exceptions
 that
 I


had
 like
 Caucasian
 friends.
 I
 had
 all


kind
 of
 uh
 uh
 different
 friends.


>> Yeah.


>> My
 teenager
 years
 in
 Canada
 was
 great.


It
 was
 like
 some
 of
 the
 best
 years
 like


I
 think
 those
 years
 are
 really
 shaped
 to


me
 to
 be
 a
 happy
 person.
 I'm
 generally
 a


happy
 person.


>> How
 did
 it
 feel
 when
 you
 weren't
 able
 to


get
 into
 my
 alma
 mater
 University
 of


Wateroo
 and
 so
 had
 to
 settle
 for
 McGill?


>> How
 did
 that
 make
 you
 feel?
 Does
 it
 make


you
 feel
 stupid?


So
 actually
 u
 I
 was
 decid
 my
 sister
 went


to
 Waterloo
 so
 I
 was
 I
 was
 uh
 deciding


between
 Waterloo
 and
 U
 McGill
 and
 maybe


UT.
 Uh
 I
 knew
 I
 wasn't
 going
 to
 go
 to


UBC.
 I
 wanted
 a
 different
 city.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 actually
 UBC
 gave
 me
 an
 offer
 but
 I


just
 knew
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go


go
 there.
 Um
 at
 the
 at
 the
 time
 I
 uh
 my


friend's
 uh
 mother
 who
 I
 really
 respect


uh
 uh
 she
 said
 well
 you
 might
 want
 to


become
 a
 doctor
 because
 doctors
 have
 a


good
 living
 good
 a
 good
 lifestyle.
 Um
 I


took
 her
 advice.
 I
 study
 biology
 and


what
 is
 not
 much
 of
 a
 biology
 school.


>> True.


>> So,
 uh
 I
 went
 to
 McGill.
 Uh
 but
 then
 um


one
 semester
 later
 I
 said,
 "No,
 no
 more


biology.
 I
 got
 to
 I'm
 going
 to
 move
 to


computer
 science."


>> Was
 it
 a
 typical
 kind
 of
 college


experience
 for
 you?
 Did
 you
 have
 great


jobs
 in
 the
 summertime
 or
 were
 you
 just


like
 a
 an
 average
 normal
 university
 kid?


>> How'd
 you
 pay
 for
 school
 by
 the
 way?


>> I
 worked
 every
 summer.
 Uh
 I
 worked
 every


summer
 and
 I
 also
 worked
 part-time


during
 the
 school
 year.
 Um
 so


>> So
 no
 debt.
 You
 were
 like
 I
 must


graduate
 without
 debt.


>> Yeah.
 I
 didn't
 take
 any
 student
 debt.
 Uh


the
 first
 year
 I
 actually
 still
 took


about
 $6,000
 Canadian
 dollars
 from
 my


dad.
 Um
 the
 second
 year
 I
 was
 still
 a


bit
 short.
 My
 sister
 gave
 me
 $3,000.
 And


then
 from
 that
 point
 on
 I
 never
 took


money
 from
 uh
 uh
 uh
 at
 all.
 I
 just
 I
 was


self-sustainable.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.
 So
 no
 student
 debt.
 Very
 lucky.
 U


and
 uh
 but
 I
 just
 worked
 every
 summer


every
 like
 Yeah.


>> You
 know
 the
 best
 thing
 about
 Waterlue


which
 was
 a
 savior
 for
 me


>> the
 co-op
 was
 co-op
 program.
 Yeah.
 And
 I


had
 these
 incredible
 co-op
 jobs.
 I
 still


graduated
 with
 about
 $30,000
 of
 debt.


>> But
 I
 was
 also
 pretty
 prolific
 trader


>> and
 equities.


>> Okay.


>> And
 my
 boss,
 this
 guy
 Mike
 Fischer,


>> did
 this
 incredible
 kindness
 to
 me
 where


>> I
 was
 working
 at
 a
 bank.
 And
 I
 was
 a


derivatives
 trader.
 That
 was
 my
 day
 job.


But
 I
 was
 trading
 equities
 and
 I
 had


made
 him
 enough
 money.
 And
 he
 said,
 he


called
 me
 Sherman.
 Didn't
 call
 me


Chimathi.
 He
 said,
 "Sherman,
 how
 much


debt
 do
 you
 have?"
 And
 I
 said,
 "It's


about
 30."
 I
 said, "Fish,
 it's
 about


30,000."
 32,000.


And
 he
 said,
 "Go
 downstairs
 right
 now
 to


the
 CIBC
 and
 pay
 your
 debt
 and
 I'll


write
 you
 a
 check."


>> Wow.
 You
 should
 have.


>> And
 he
 wrote
 me
 a
 $32,000
 check.


>> I
 should
 have
 said
 3,000
 300,000.


>> But
 Canada
 is
 incredible
 because
 you
 can


get
 this
 education
 and
 it
 doesn't
 saddle


you
 with
 this


>> Yeah.


>> debt
 that
 you
 can't
 overcome,


>> which
 is
 not
 true
 in
 the
 United
 States


for
 many
 people
 anymore.


>> Yeah.
 Even
 in
 McGill,
 there
 were
 people


from
 the
 United
 States
 going
 to
 McGill,


paying
 international
 student
 uh
 tuition


and
 it
 was
 still
 cheaper
 than
 the
 US.
 I


was
 like
 that's
 crazy.


>> That's
 crazy.


>> Yeah.
 So
 yeah,
 we
 were
 lucky
 that
 the
 US


the
 Canadian
 tuition
 was
 okay.


>> So
 you
 graduate
 from
 McGill
 in
 computer


science.


>> Yeah.
 In
 computer
 actually
 I
 didn't


graduate
 from
 McGill.
 Um
 I
 went
 there


for
 four
 years
 and
 on
 my
 third
 year
 I


got
 an
 internship
 on
 my
 fourth
 year
 I


got
 my
 third
 year
 I
 got
 an
 internship


job
 and
 then
 um
 u
 extended
 extended


extended
 and
 I
 didn't
 go
 didn't
 go
 back


to
 McGill.
 So
 I
 didn't
 graduate
 from


McGill
 and
 later
 on
 I
 found
 out
 I
 still


need
 a
 bachelor's
 degree
 to
 apply
 for


work
 visas
 in
 Japan.
 So
 I
 went
 to
 one
 of


this
 is
 like
 the
 doc
 this
 is
 2000
 this


is
 the
 do
 like
 height.
 Um
 so
 I
 went
 to


an
 online
 education
 uh
 program
 called


the
 American
 College
 of
 Computer
 Science


uh
 and
 got
 a
 degree
 there.


>> Oh
 my
 god.
 Yeah.
 So
 you're
 technically
 a


graduate
 from
 that
 school.


>> Technically.
 Yes.


>> Okay.
 So
 which
 internship
 did
 you
 get


where
 you
 started
 to
 work
 there?
 Uh
 so


uh
 I
 got
 an
 internship
 uh
 at
 to
 in


Tokyo.
 Uh
 so
 I
 always
 uh
 in
 from
 from


first
 year
 college
 I
 always
 worked
 on
 a


programming
 job.
 So
 I
 worked
 at
 a


company
 called
 original
 sim
 writing
 some


simulation
 software
 and
 then
 um
 third


year
 I
 got
 into
 a
 company
 in
 Japan
 in


Tokyo
 called
 Fusion
 Systems
 um
 Japan
 and


then
 uh
 they
 were
 writing
 uh
 order


execution
 systems
 for
 brokers
 of
 uh
 the


Tokyo
 stock.


>> Sorry
 that's
 a
 Japanese
 company
 with
 an


office
 in
 Montreal
 or
 an
 office
 in


Canada
 or
 no?


>> No no
 I
 I
 went
 to
 Tokyo.
 You
 went
 to


Tokyo.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 actually
 an
 American
 uh
 a


bunch
 of
 American
 guys
 company
 that's
 in


Tokyo.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 like
 a
 bunch
 of
 guys


were


>> And
 you're
 thinking
 this
 is
 an


adventure.
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 and
 live
 in


Tokyo
 for
 a
 summer.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 I
 was
 a
 college


student
 and
 living
 in
 Tokyo
 is
 like
 a


you
 know
 it's
 fun.
 It's
 dream.
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 And
 uh
 and
 the
 first
 time
 you
 go


there
 is
 like
 it's
 it's


>> from
 the
 future.


>> It's
 it's
 cool.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 what
 kind
 of
 software
 did
 you
 write?


>> Mostly
 order
 execution
 software.
 So
 the


same
 software
 like
 that
 moves
 orders
 and


buy
 what
 drives
 Binance
 today.


>> Pretty
 much.
 pretty
 much.
 So
 it's
 the


same
 same
 style
 like
 actually
 all
 the


software
 I
 was
 involved
 with
 have
 no


decision-
 making.


>> So
 when
 you
 first
 and
 were
 exposed
 to


this
 it
 was
 not
 like
 oh
 wow
 I
 love
 this


>> this
 makes
 sense
 or
 was
 it
 more
 okay
 I'm


asked
 to
 write
 this
 code
 and
 I


understand
 the
 concept
 so
 let
 me
 just
 do


it.
 Were
 you
 attracted
 to
 the
 subject


matter
 or
 you
 just
 did
 it
 because
 it
 was


your
 job?
 I
 first
 did
 it
 was
 because
 it


was
 my
 job
 right
 I
 was
 so
 young
 I
 didn't


know
 what
 all
 the
 different
 industries


are
 and
 actually
 when
 I
 got
 to
 the


company
 the
 company
 was
 giving
 me
 a


project
 on
 working
 on
 dig
 uh
 digital


imaging
 storage
 systems
 like
 know
 this


basically
 iPhone
 photos
 app
 but
 for
 for


for
 medical
 imaging
 uh
 for
 for
 Nikon


>> but
 very
 soon
 the
 company's
 main
 main


product
 is
 the
 order
 execution
 system


right


>> so
 I
 was
 involved
 in
 that
 and
 then
 that


became
 the
 thing
 over
 my
 career
 and
 I


like
 it
 uh
 because
 um
 it's
 it
 requires


quite
 a
 lot
 of
 technical
 expertise


everything
 is
 about
 efficiency
 making
 it


go
 as
 fast
 as
 as
 possible
 uh
 process
 as


low
 latency
 as
 possible
 right


>> um
 that
 kind
 of
 appeals
 to
 me
 I'm
 an


efficiency
 kind
 of
 driven
 guy
 like
 like


subconsciously
 and
 just
 to
 double
 click


on
 that
 when
 you
 look
 at
 high
 frequency


trading
 organization
 the
 susanas
 the


jumps
 they
 go
 to
 such
 a
 degree
 to


basically
 optimize
 for
 efficiency
 and


low
 latency
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 it's


their
 own
 circuit
 breakers
 it's
 their


own
 physical
 fiber
 infrastructure


they're
 willing
 to
 sort
 of
 pay
 the
 price


to
 just
 shave
 off
 a
 handful
 of


milliseconds
 on
 either
 end.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 does
 that
 manifest
 in
 the
 software?


So
 when
 you're
 writing
 that
 kind
 of


software,
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 optimize


for
 those
 boundary
 conditions
 in
 code?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 well,
 there's
 quite
 a
 few


levels,
 right?
 The
 first
 level
 you
 do
 is


basically
 you
 write
 a
 software
 to
 be


efficient
 and
 fast
 like
 no
 no
 slowness.


Uh
 uh
 you
 want
 to
 remove
 all
 the


database
 lookups.
 So
 you
 want
 to
 do


everything
 in
 memory
 and
 then
 um
 you


want
 to
 reduce
 any
 sort
 of
 additional


computation.
 uh
 you
 want
 to
 simplify
 the


risk
 checks
 pre
 especially
 pre-order
 pre


pre-trade
 uh
 risk
 checks
 and
 then
 the


more
 advanced
 versions
 you
 move
 on
 to


like
 the
 FPGA
 which
 is
 a
 network
 chip


card
 that's
 on
 the
 on
 on
 the
 on
 the
 on


the
 network
 card
 on
 the
 what
 we
 call
 the


ether
 ether
 card


>> so
 that
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 go
 all
 the
 way


up
 to
 memory
 and
 come
 all
 the
 way
 back


down
 to
 the
 processor


>> so
 back
 then
 when
 I
 was
 like
 still


writing
 code
 like
 maybe
 10
 years
 ago


that
 round
 trip
 is
 about
 100
 mill
 100


microconds


>> microcs
 yeah


>> and
 then
 um
 by
 avoiding
 that
 you
 reduce


down
 to
 20
 microconds
 right


>> and
 then
 you
 move
 it
 to
 physical


infrastructure
 you
 want
 a
 collocation


right
 you
 want
 to


>> why
 haven't
 these
 organizations
 like
 in


the
 AI
 world
 for
 example
 with
 grock
 our


big
 observation
 even
 10
 years
 ago
 when


we
 were
 starting
 the
 business
 was
 this


exact
 idea
 which
 is
 it's
 really


inefficient
 for
 to
 sit
 in
 a
 GPU
 to
 go


all
 the
 way
 up
 to
 HBM
 to
 come
 back
 down


so
 let's
 just
 take
 SRAMM
 and
 just
 do


everything
 here
 on
 chip
 right


>> manage
 it
 with
 C
 to
 that
 technical


problem
 made
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 and
 very


very
 fast
 for
 the
 decode
 phase
 of


inference
 makes
 a
 ton
 of
 sense
 Why
 when


so
 much
 money
 is
 on
 the
 line
 for
 high


frequency
 trading,
 why
 did
 they
 never


try
 their
 own
 custom
 silicon?
 I


understand
 FPGAAS,
 but
 nobody
 really


went
 to
 the
 point
 of
 actually
 saying


here's
 a
 specific
 ASIC
 or
 did
 they
 and


we
 just
 don't
 know
 about
 it.
 I
 don't


think
 it
 exists
 on
 very
 large
 scale.
 Um


the
 uh
 I
 think
 the
 algorithms
 change
 too


often.
 So
 when
 you
 go
 to
 hardware
 like


you
 want
 to
 design
 your
 own
 chip,
 uh
 it


it
 is
 very
 efficient.
 is
 highly
 is
 very


fast
 but
 when
 you
 want
 to
 change
 it
 uh


it
 takes
 a
 long
 time
 right
 so
 when
 when


you
 want
 to
 reprogram
 it
 I
 think
 FPJ


already
 offers
 kind
 of
 the
 the
 best


>> best
 of
 both
 the
 both
 worlds
 even
 FPGA


you
 want
 to
 reprogram
 it
 the
 programming


cycle
 is
 much
 is
 10
 times
 longer
 than


software


>> the
 company
 you
 worked
 at
 in
 Japan
 was


it
 successful


>> it's
 successful
 you
 got
 that
 company
 got


sold
 to
 a
 NASDAQ
 listed
 company
 just


before
 2000


>> for
 a
 lot
 of
 money


>> for
 like
 $52
 million
 back
 then
 so
 that


was
 decent
 money
 yeah


>> and
 So,
 is
 that
 when
 you
 said,
 "Hey,


hold
 on.
 There's
 something
 here."
 Or
 no,


was
 it
 something
 else
 that
 happened?


>> No.
 Uh,
 so
 at
 that
 time
 I
 was
 too
 young.


I
 was
 like
 20
 something.
 Um,


>> so
 you're
 working
 at
 this
 place.
 You're


just
 a
 coder.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> You're
 a
 salary
 man.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> In
 Japanese
 terms,
 right?


>> Salary
 man.
 Yeah.


>> You're
 a
 salary
 man.
 So
 then
 walk
 us


through
 what
 happens
 afterwards.


>> So
 uh
 that
 company
 got
 sold.
 They


acquired
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 culture


clashes
 between
 the
 parent
 company


versus
 the
 original
 company.
 Um
 that's


my
 first
 experience
 about
 you
 know
 how


mergers
 may
 not
 work.


>> Yeah.
 the
 the
 two
 managements
 were
 just


clashing
 and
 then
 um
 uh
 the
 the
 same


partners
 went
 to
 do
 a
 different
 company


uh
 called
 building
 two
 um
 but
 now
 this


partners
 the
 I
 didn't
 get
 any
 money
 but


the
 partners
 got
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 money


now
 so
 they
 rented
 a
 very
 fancy
 office


um
 that
 company
 only
 lasted
 a
 year
 uh
 it


means
 that
 previous
 success
 doesn't


guarantee
 future
 success


>> in
 fact


>> um
 so
 uh
 they
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 had
 a


very
 nice
 office
 but
 has
 zero
 zero
 zero


revenue
 so
 that
 folded
 within
 a
 year
 and


that's
 2001
 and
 um
 so
 uh
 and
 early
 2001


I
 was
 looking
 for
 new
 jobs
 and
 then


Bloomberg
 was
 hiring
 and
 this
 is
 right


before
 911.
 Um
 I
 kind
 of
 got
 an
 offer


before
 911
 and
 then
 911
 happened.
 I


still
 haven't
 moved
 and
 then


>> where
 was
 this
 to
 New
 York
 or


>> this
 was
 in
 well
 I
 was
 still
 in
 Tokyo


back
 then
 and
 then
 Bloomberg
 is
 in
 New


York.
 The
 offer
 I
 was
 supposed


>> The
 offer
 was
 in
 New York.


>> The
 offer
 was
 in
 New
 York.
 So
 after
 911


I
 called
 Bloomberg
 say
 hey
 is
 the
 job


still
 there?
 Do
 you
 still
 want
 me
 to
 go?


And
 they
 said
 well
 do
 you
 still
 want
 to


come?
 I
 was
 like
 yeah
 okay.
 So
 then
 I


went.
 So
 I
 went
 to
 New
 York
 in
 November


of
 2001.


>> Wow.
 What
 was
 that
 like?


>> The
 streets
 were
 pretty
 quiet.
 Um


>> Yeah.


>> And
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 I
 was
 fine.
 I
 was


you
 know
 um
 New
 York
 is
 a
 is
 New
 York


was
 quiet
 for
 a
 few
 months
 but
 it
 became


lively
 pretty
 quickly
 I
 think.
 So
 I


didn't
 feel
 too
 much
 uh
 issues.


>> Um
 um
 so
 I
 then
 went
 to
 New
 York
 and


worked
 at
 Bloomberg
 for
 four
 years


>> doing
 exact
 again
 the
 same
 thing.
 You're


kind
 of
 a
 salary
 guy.
 You're
 working
 at


a
 big
 company,


>> salary,
 bonus,
 maybe
 some
 options
 or


some
 phantom
 equity
 or
 something
 like


that.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 um
 I
 joined
 as
 a
 senior


developer.
 Uh
 I
 was
 put
 into
 a
 team


called
 uh
 tradebook
 futures.
 They
 just


formed
 this
 team
 uh
 and
 uh
 they
 had
 a


system
 that
 allowed
 people
 to
 trade


futures
 on
 Bloomberg,
 but
 it
 wasn't
 it


was
 like
 spread
 out.
 So,
 they
 collected


that
 into
 into into
 one
 into
 one
 team


>> and
 still
 no
 inkling
 of
 like
 that


entrepreneurial
 bug.


>> Not
 really.
 back
 then
 I
 was
 like
 nah
 I
 I


worked


>> what
 were
 you
 looking
 for
 stability
 like


why
 like
 why
 Bloomberg
 being
 in
 New
 York


like
 what
 was
 it


>> I
 was
 just
 a
 young
 guy
 I
 was
 like
 I


think
 I
 was
 like
 24
 20
 24
 25
 okay


>> so
 I
 was
 just
 a
 young
 guy
 trying
 to
 get


a
 job
 you
 know
 uh
 experience
 different


parts
 of
 the
 world
 and
 get
 and
 and
 just


find
 my
 way
 through
 um
 I
 I
 knew
 I
 wasn't


experienced
 enough
 to
 do


entrepreneurship
 myself
 right
 so
 I
 was


and
 I
 I
 was
 working
 a
 small
 company
 in


Tokyo
 the
 company
 only
 had
 like
 200


Bloomberg
 at
 the
 time
 had
 about
 3,000


people.
 So
 to
 me
 that
 was
 a
 big
 company.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 they
 fancy
 offices,
 fish
 tanks
 and


free
 food
 and
 everything.
 Um
 so
 I
 joined


as
 a
 senior
 developer.
 I
 got
 some
 good


bosses.
 I
 got
 promoted
 three
 times
 in


two
 years
 and
 then
 I
 was
 leading
 a
 team


of
 60
 initially
 and
 then
 kind
 of
 grew
 to


about
 80
 people.
 Um
 and
 that's
 when
 I


became
 sort
 of
 a
 manager.
 Uh
 I
 no
 longer


wrote
 code
 and
 I
 started


>> the
 worst
 transition.


>> The
 worst
 transition.
 Right.
 The
 worst.


>> So
 um
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 my
 Bloomberg


experience.
 Yeah.
 So
 that
 and
 I
 Yeah.
 So


I
 had
 to
 stay
 there
 for
 four
 years.


>> And
 then
 you
 quit
 and
 moved
 to
 China.


>> Yes.


>> How
 does
 that
 happen?


>> I
 think
 was
 wrong
 like
 uh
 beginning
 of


2005.
 Um
 again
 the
 same
 uh
 friends
 I
 had


I
 made
 in
 Japan,
 they
 were
 talking
 about


starting
 a
 new
 company,
 a
 new
 uh
 fintech


company
 and
 they
 were
 in
 Asia,
 right?
 So


they're
 talking
 about
 Tokyo,
 Shanghai
 or


Hong
 Kong.
 And
 they
 said
 Shanghai
 is


most
 likely
 the
 most
 happening
 place
 for


the
 future
 of
 fintech.
 Um
 we
 should
 have


picked
 Hong
 Kong.
 Hong
 Kong
 had
 a
 lot


more
 happening
 since
 then.


>> Um,
 so
 I
 went
 there
 in
 2005.
 So
 the
 it


was
 like
 five
 foreigners
 from
 a
 Chinese


perspective.
 U
 five
 Caucasians,
 four


Caucasians
 plus
 a
 Japanese
 plus
 me.
 I'm


the
 only
 one
 who
 speaks
 Chinese
 and
 my


Chinese
 was
 kind
 of
 rusty
 back
 then
 too.


So
 the
 six
 of
 us
 went
 there
 to
 do
 a
 new


IT
 start
 startup
 in
 Shanghai.


>> You
 So
 all
 you
 guys
 just
 land
 there
 and


what
 was
 the
 idea?
 So
 we
 thought
 you


know
 we
 have
 all
 this
 Wall
 Street


experience
 on
 Wall
 Street
 trading


technology
 experience.


>> So
 your
 other
 friends
 had
 they
 moved
 to


New
 York
 or
 no
 they
 were
 still
 in
 Japan


doing
 their
 own
 thing.


>> Two
 of
 the
 friends
 were
 in
 New
 York
 with


me
 and
 then
 um
 uh
 the
 other
 three
 were


from
 Japan
 right
 they
 were
 there
 they


always
 they
 were
 so
 the
 six
 of
 us
 came


together
 and
 uh
 we
 wanted
 to
 do
 we
 want


our
 idea
 was
 uh
 let's
 bring
 the
 wall


street
 trading
 technology
 into
 China
 so


we
 can
 service
 the
 brokers
 and
 exchanges


in
 China.
 Um
 but
 then
 so
 we
 went
 they


rented
 a
 very
 fancy
 office
 again.
 Uh


>> wait
 okay
 so
 hold
 on
 just


>> so
 when
 you
 guys
 start
 this
 company
 this


so
 this
 is
 now
 your
 first


entrepreneurial
 you're
 like
 okay
 let's


do
 this


>> pretty
 much


>> did
 you
 know
 to
 even
 ask
 the
 question


like
 okay
 guys
 what's
 our
 equity
 split


what's
 the
 cap
 table
 did
 you
 know
 any
 of


these
 things
 or
 you're
 just
 like
 great


let's
 go
 do
 it
 I'm
 just
 assuming
 it's


one
 sixth
 we're
 equal
 like
 how
 how
 did


it
 all


>> it
 wasn't
 one6
 it
 was
 like
 the
 top
 guy


had
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 39
 40%
 and
 the
 the


the
 rest
 five
 of
 us
 split
 equally
 so
 I


had
 about
 11%
 %
 or
 so.


>> Okay.


>> So,
 I
 knew
 that,
 but
 I
 didn't
 know
 like,


you
 know,
 all
 the
 ins
 and
 outs
 about,


you
 know,
 shareholder
 rights,
 uh,
 what


terms.
 I
 didn't
 know
 any
 of
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Preferred
 versus
 common,
 none
 of


it.


>> And
 then
 I


>> You're
 like,
 great,
 I
 got
 11%.
 I'm


moving
 to
 Shanghai.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 just
 have
 11%.
 I
 didn't
 I


have
 no
 idea
 what
 common
 stock
 is
 or


versus
 preferred.
 So,
 uh,
 just
 went
 and


then
 but
 so
 I
 was
 a
 junior
 partner
 in


this
 group.
 And
 then,
 uh,
 once
 we
 landed


in
 China,
 I
 start
 because
 I
 speak


Chinese,
 right?
 So,
 I
 began
 talking
 to


potential
 clients.
 I
 went
 to
 talk
 to


brokers.
 I
 found
 out
 we
 are
 registered


as
 a
 wholly
 foreigner
 owned
 uh
 what
 we


call
 wolfie
 uh
 holy
 holy
 foreigner
 owned


enterprise.


>> Yeah.


>> The
 Chinese
 brokers
 and
 financial


institutions
 are
 not
 allowed
 to
 work


with
 a
 wolfie.


>> That's
 right.


>> U
 so
 we
 found
 out
 after
 we
 started
 a


company
 while
 we
 were
 in
 Shanghai
 and
 so


the
 company
 pivoted
 towards
 doing
 um
 uh


any
 any
 any
 IT
 system
 for
 any
 for
 any


company.
 We
 can
 be
 like


>> work
 for
 hire.


>> Work
 for
 hire.
 We
 can
 be
 fix


>> deote.
 You
 became
 deoid.
 uh
 not
 not
 even


deoid
 we
 can
 be
 fixing
 printers
 or
 we


can
 be
 writing
 like
 you
 know
 SAP


implementations
 for
 you
 we
 did
 all
 of


that
 so
 there's
 a
 whole
 spectrum
 of


things
 and
 so
 we
 did
 that
 for
 a
 few


years
 and
 we
 actually
 made
 a
 living


>> for
 a
 few
 years


>> yeah
 for
 for
 for
 a
 few
 years
 like
 uh
 and


we
 made
 a
 living
 out
 of
 that
 yeah
 we
 we


started
 we
 had
 a
 quite
 a
 number
 of


automotive
 clients
 uh
 the
 Shanghai


General
 Motors
 uh
 Shanghai
 Works
 Wagon


uh
 Shanghai
 first
 auto
 mo
 uh
 first


automotive
 they
 were
 all
 clients
 of
 ours


and
 like
 maybe
 three
 or
 four
 years
 in
 uh


we
 started
 having
 offices
 in
 Hong
 Kong


and
 then
 we
 were
 dealing
 with
 a
 Morgan


Stanley,
 Deutsche
 Bank,
 Credit
 Swiss.


>> So
 it
 grew
 so
 it
 was
 it
 was
 successful.


>> The
 company
 is
 still
 around.
 The
 company


is
 still
 around.
 So
 I
 I
 left
 in
 2013


after
 8
 years.
 Um
 but
 the
 company
 is


still
 around.


>> So
 in
 the
 eight
 years
 you
 worked
 at
 that


company
 all
 in
 Shanghai.


>> I
 was
 mostly
 in
 Shanghai,
 but
 then
 I


spent
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 time
 helping
 to
 set


up
 the
 Hong
 Kong
 office
 and
 then
 I
 was


also
 doing
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 for
 some


clients
 in in
 Tokyo.


>> How
 big
 did
 that
 company
 get?
 I
 think


even
 you
 got
 to
 about
 200
 people
 again


and
 it's
 kind
 of
 stayed
 there
 for
 as
 for


as
 as
 far
 as
 I
 know
 even
 till
 now.


>> And
 so
 as
 a
 junior
 partner
 you
 just
 take


profits
 and
 you
 share
 it
 like


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 uh
 uh
 well
 actually
 I
 we


didn't
 take
 that
 much
 profits.
 Um
 I


actually
 invested
 most
 of
 my
 savings


back
 into
 that
 company
 and
 I
 actually


didn't
 cash
 out
 a
 penny.
 Um
 but
 wow


>> after
 a
 few
 years
 the
 company
 was
 uh
 s


stable
 enough
 to
 pay
 the
 partner


salaries
 that
 all
 of
 our
 kids
 go
 to


international
 school.
 So
 we
 get
 a
 we
 get


a
 we
 get
 a
 six
 figure
 salary.


>> At
 that
 point
 you
 had
 gotten
 married.


>> Yes.
 Yeah.
 So
 at
 that
 point
 uh
 uh
 Yeah.


So
 at
 that
 point
 I
 got
 married
 when
 I


was
 in
 New
 York.
 So
 like
 uh
 Yeah.
 So
 and


then
 u
 uh
 Yeah.
 So
 we
 I
 had
 two
 kids.


>> And
 you
 had
 met
 your
 ex-wife.
 How?


>> Yeah.
 I
 met
 her
 I
 met
 her
 in
 in
 in
 Tokyo


when
 I
 first
 went
 to
 Tokyo.
 So
 I
 met
 her


in
 1999ish


um
 when
 I
 when
 I
 was
 first
 in
 Tokyo
 like


doing
 the
 interns.


>> Okay.
 And
 then
 um
 uh
 she
 visited
 me
 in


New
 York
 and
 then
 you
 know
 we
 got


married
 and
 then
 uh
 we
 had
 kids
 now
 we


are
 separated
 or
 we're
 divorced
 in


Shanghai.
 I
 had
 young
 kids
 and
 you
 know


it
 was
 enough
 salary
 to
 put
 the
 kids


into
 into
 international
 school
 and
 that


was
 that
 was
 good
 enough
 for
 me.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 far
 again


>> nothing
 here
 tells
 anybody
 that
 you're


about
 to
 go
 and
 start
 Binance.


>> No
 no
 nothing


>> nothing.
 No
 I
 didn't
 know.
 So
 then
 2013


2014,


how
 old
 were
 you
 then
 at
 that
 point?
 You


were


>> uh
 20
 2013
 I
 I
 would
 be
 36.


>> Yeah.
 Mid-30s.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So


>> So
 again,
 salary
 guy.


>> Yeah.


>> Junior
 partner
 at
 this
 thing.
 It's
 going


well.
 Your
 kids
 are
 in
 private
 school.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> So
 then
 what
 happens?


>> So
 then
 uh
 I
 came
 across
 Bitcoin,
 right?


So
 um
 well,
 one
 of
 my
 friends
 tells
 me,


"Look,
 see,
 you
 got
 to
 look
 at
 this


thing
 called
 Bitcoin."
 I
 look
 into
 it.
 I


was
 like
 uh
 it
 took
 me
 about
 roughly
 six


months
 to
 fully
 understand
 it.
 So
 that


was
 from
 like
 roughly
 July
 2013


>> and
 that's
 because
 you
 read
 the
 white


paper
 and
 you
 said
 I
 need
 to
 read
 it


again
 and
 read
 it
 again
 or


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 pretty
 much.
 And
 then
 um


because
 back
 then
 there
 was
 the
 Bitcoin


talk
 or
 forum
 and
 then
 that's
 pretty


much
 it.


>> But
 did
 you
 see
 my
 Bloomberg
 article
 in


2012?
 Is
 that
 that
 had
 any
 influence?


>> Unfortunately,
 I
 don't
 I
 I
 read
 a
 bunch


of
 stuff.
 I
 actually
 don't
 remember
 what


I


>> I'm
 just
 kidding.
 But
 I
 did
 write
 this


thing
 and
 it's
 funny
 because
 I
 had
 a


kind
 of
 a
 relationship
 with
 Mike


Bloomberg.
 was
 kind
 of
 not
 even
 mentor


like
 he
 was
 just
 too
 senior
 but


>> he
 knew
 me
 he
 liked
 me
 he
 would
 invite


me
 to
 certain
 things


>> with
 Mike
 Bloomberg


>> yeah
 with
 Bloomberg
 and
 and
 then
 I
 got


to
 know
 some
 of
 Mike's
 team


>> and
 in
 2012
 or
 so
 they
 said
 would
 you


write
 an
 op-ed


>> okay


>> and
 I
 was
 like
 yeah
 and
 I
 wrote
 it
 about


Bitcoin
 and
 I
 said
 everybody
 should
 put


1%
 of
 their
 net
 worth
 into
 Bitcoin
 and
 I


said
 it's
 basically
 schmuck
 insurance


>> and
 then
 they
 published
 it
 in
 the


Bloomberg
 terminal
 or
 whatever
 and


that's
 when
 I
 got
 redpilled
 on
 Bitcoin


where
 I
 was
 like
 man
 it's
 the
 most


incredibly
 interesting
 technical
 product


that
 I
 had
 read
 about
 and
 I
 think
 the


thing
 that
 captivated
 me
 I
 don't
 know if


you
 felt
 this
 way
 it
 was
 the
 only
 white


paper
 that
 I
 read
 end
 to
 end
 where
 I


thought
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most


elegantly
 written
 pieces
 of


non-technical
 pros
 do
 you
 know
 what
 I'm


trying
 to
 say
 like
 it's
 not


>> something
 that
 is
 like
 dense
 and
 an


archive
 that
 is
 just
 meant
 for
 PhDs


>> you
 could
 literally
 give
 it
 to
 your


sister
 to
 your
 brother
 to
 somebody


non-technical
 And
 they
 would
 understand


it.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 it's
 only
 nine
 pages.


>> And
 exactly.
 You
 know what
 an
 enormous


amount
 of
 intellectual
 skill
 it
 takes
 to


do
 that.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Oh
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's
 much
 harder


to
 write
 it
 very
 short.


>> Much
 harder
 and
 elegantly
 and
 simply.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Anybody
 else
 try
 to
 rewrite


that?
 I
 think
 it'
 be
 90
 pages.


>> So
 the
 friend
 that
 showed
 it
 to
 you,
 was


he
 a
 co-orker
 of
 yours
 or
 no?
 Just
 a


random
 friend
 in
 Shanghai.


>> It's
 a
 friend.
 It's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


random
 Well,
 not
 a
 random.
 He's
 a


friend.
 Uh
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 working


relationships.
 His
 name
 is
 Ron
 Tao.
 He


runs
 uh
 I
 guess
 now
 Skyline
 Ventures.


And
 back
 then
 he
 he
 was
 at
 Lightseed


Ventures


>> of
 course


>> he
 was
 a
 managing
 director
 of
 Lightseed


Ventures
 in
 China.


>> Okay.


>> So
 we
 play
 we
 have
 a
 poker
 house
 game


like
 you
 know
 small
 stakes.
 Um
 a
 bunch


of
 uh
 I
 a
 bunch
 of
 entrepreneur
 like


struggling
 entrepreneurs
 versus
 like


VCs.
 Uh
 so
 the
 VCs
 have
 all
 the
 money


and
 all


>> David
 versus
 Yeah.


>> So
 but
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 a
 fun
 it's
 a


fun
 game.
 It's
 not
 a
 very
 serious
 game.


So
 on
 in
 one
 of
 the
 poker
 games
 uh
 Ron


says
 CD
 you
 should
 look
 at
 this
 thing


called
 Bitcoin.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,


Bitcoin."
 Okay.
 So,
 uh,
 and
 so
 we
 talked


about
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 then
 Bobby


Lee,
 uh,
 who
 was
 at
 the
 time
 was
 working


for
 Walmart,
 was
 just
 about
 to
 quit


Walmart
 to
 join
 BTC
 China
 to
 become


their
 CEO.
 And,
 uh,


>> uh,
 as
 part
 of
 that
 deal,
 Bobby
 said
 he


will
 bring
 Ron
 in
 as
 an
 investor,


Lightseed
 into


>> into
 BT
 BTCC


>> into
 BTCC.
 So,
 that's
 in
 two
 uh,
 July


2013.
 I
 was
 like,
 okay.
 So,
 they
 two


guys
 are
 pretty
 serious
 about
 this.
 So
 I


had
 lunch
 with
 Bobby
 the
 next
 day
 and


Bobby
 said
 put
 10%
 of
 your
 net
 worth


into
 Bitcoin.
 He
 said
 there's
 a
 small


chance
 you
 will
 go
 to
 zero
 then
 you
 lose


10%.
 Uh
 there's
 a
 much
 higher
 chance
 you


will
 go
 10x
 and
 you'll
 double
 your
 net


worth.
 I
 was
 like
 okay
 sounds
 pretty


serious.
 So
 u
 that's
 when
 I
 started


learning
 about
 reading
 the
 white
 paper


more
 carefully.
 Took
 me
 six
 months.
 Uh


so
 it
 was
 till
 the
 end
 of
 2013
 I
 started


like
 I'm
 I'm
 convinced
 now.
 I'm
 ready
 to


go.
 But
 then
 Bitcoin
 went
 from
 $70
 in


mid
 2013
 to
 like
 $1,000
 by
 end
 of
 2013.


So
 you
 already
 went
 more
 than
 like
 15x.


>> How
 did
 that
 make
 you
 feel?


>> I
 was
 like,
 I'm
 I'm
 too
 late.


>> I
 was
 like,
 I
 wish
 I
 got
 in
 early.


>> Yeah.


>> Cuz
 when
 back
 then,
 right?
 No.
 Doesn't


matter
 when
 you
 get
 into
 Bitcoin,
 you


always
 feel
 late.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 Because
 everyone
 you
 talk
 to
 has


in
 the
 Bitcoin
 industry
 has
 bought


before
 you.


>> And
 did
 you
 talk
 to
 anybody
 while
 you


were
 learning
 about
 it
 to
 say
 like
 you


have
 a
 community
 in
 in
 Shanghai?
 there's


a
 comm
 there's
 a
 very
 small
 community
 in


Shanghai
 and
 then
 I
 was
 basically


talking
 to
 anybody
 in
 the
 world
 that's


that's
 willing
 to
 talk
 with
 me
 uh
 and


then
 I
 had
 a
 couple
 friends
 in
 Taiwan


they
 used
 to
 they
 they
 worked
 for
 TSMC


back
 then
 uh
 because
 and
 then
 they
 were


trying
 to
 do
 a
 mining
 chip
 uh
 for
 for


Bitcoin
 so
 two
 of
 those
 guys
 left
 TSMC


try
 to
 do
 this
 startup
 startup
 never


never
 really
 took
 off
 but
 that
 was
 one


group
 of
 guys
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 um
 there


was
 uh
 another
 couple
 they
 were
 mostly


minors
 there
 was
 another
 guy
 called
 um


his
 nickname
 is
 fish
 uh
 silver
 fish
 uh


in
 China.
 He's
 like
 a
 big
 minor.
 He's


runs
 the
 F2
 pool
 even
 today.


>> Oh
 sure.


>> So
 those
 guys
 were
 based
 in
 Hondro
 um


you
 know
 I
 went
 they
 came
 to
 Shanghai
 I


talked
 to
 them
 etc.
 So
 there
 was
 a
 group


of
 guys
 that
 you
 talked
 to
 and
 then
 uh


the
 biggest
 thing
 was
 um
 in
 December


2013
 December
 13th
 2013ish
 there
 was
 a


Bitcoin
 conference
 in
 Las
 Vegas.
 I
 flew


there
 um
 to
 meet
 everyone
 everyone
 in


the
 industry
 was
 there.
 Uh
 there
 was
 a


200
 people
 conference.
 Uh
 Vitalik
 was


there,
 Matt
 Rosak
 was
 there,
 Charlie
 Lee


was
 there,
 uh
 um
 bunch
 of
 guys
 were


there.
 Um
 and
 the
 same
 same
 guys
 still


today.
 Um
 but
 and
 then
 at
 the
 time
 just


before
 that
 it
 was
 the
 Silk
 Road
 arrest


of
 uh
 Ross


>> Wubber.


>> So
 the
 media
 was
 like
 no
 this
 Bitcoin
 is


only
 used
 by
 drug
 lords.


>> Um
 and
 when
 you
 go
 to
 the
 conference
 it


was
 like
 a
 bunch
 of
 kids,
 a
 bunch
 of


geeks
 geeks
 and
 they're
 very
 nice


people,
 right?
 So
 you
 talk
 to
 Vitalic,


you
 know,
 you
 know,
 he's
 a
 very
 nice


person.


>> Were
 you
 still
 working
 at
 that
 company


while
 you
 were
 doing
 all
 of
 this


moonlighting?


>> Yes.
 So
 this
 is
 what
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 the


>> You
 tell
 your
 partners,
 hey
 guys,
 I'm


just
 going
 to
 go
 to
 Vegas
 for
 a
 couple


days.
 I'll
 be
 back.


>> Pretty
 much.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 then
 um
 and


then
 when
 I
 got
 back,
 I
 told
 the


partners,
 I
 we
 should
 do
 a
 Bitcoin


payment
 system
 because
 Bit
 Pay
 was
 kind


of
 the
 big
 player
 back
 then.
 Uh
 Bit
 Pay


just
 raised
 $4
 million
 US
 in
 2013.


>> So
 they
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 uh
 the
 large


player


>> actually
 in
 the
 employee.


>> Can
 I
 tell
 you
 a
 very
 funny
 bit?
 I
 have


two
 Bit
 Pay
 stories.


>> Sure.


>> I
 was
 very
 focused
 on
 trying
 to
 prove


the
 transactional
 capability
 of
 Bitcoin.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 went
 to
 my
 local
 car
 dealership


>> and
 I
 bought
 a
 car
 with
 Bitcoin
 using


Bitay
 in
 201
 12
 or
 13.
 Wow.


>> That
 Range
 Rover
 is
 probably
 $90


million.
 And
 then
 even
 more
 stupidly,


there
 was
 a
 real
 estate
 development
 in


Lake
 Tahoe.


>> Yeah.
 called
 Martis
 Camp.
 Beautiful.
 And


I
 had
 owned
 a
 couple
 of
 lots
 and
 I
 said,


you
 know,
 it
 would
 be
 great
 if
 I


actually
 could
 prove
 that
 you
 could
 buy


real
 estate
 with
 Bitcoin.


>> And
 I
 called
 the
 guys
 at
 Bit
 Pay
 and


they
 were
 like,
 yeah,
 we
 can
 facilitate


this
 transaction.
 No
 problem.
 I
 bought
 a


piece
 of
 land.
 And
 then
 again,
 I
 thought


this
 is
 an
 interesting
 story.
 And
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 wrote
 about
 it.
 And


now
 that
 piece
 of
 land
 is
 a
 billion


dollars,


>> but
 you
 you
 cannot
 calculate
 this
 way,


right?
 So


>> it's
 easy.
 I
 calculate
 it
 this
 way
 every


day.


>> You
 can't
 calculate
 it
 that
 way
 because


the
 stupidest
 purchase
 ever.


>> No.
 No.
 No,
 no,
 no.
 That's
 this
 that's


the
 bucket
 of
 money
 mentality,
 right?


>> No,
 no,
 no.
 It's
 true.


>> Right.
 So,
 even
 if
 you
 didn't
 use


Bitcoin,
 you
 would
 have
 used
 some
 money


to
 some


>> Exactly.


>> buy
 the
 land.
 You
 could
 have
 used
 that


money
 to
 buy
 Bitcoin.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 So,
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 you're
 like,
 "Hey,
 we
 should
 do
 a


version
 of
 BitBay."


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 your
 partners
 are
 like,
 "What
 are


you
 talking
 about?"


>> Exactly.


>> And
 now,
 at
 this
 point,
 you
 still
 hadn't


bought
 any
 Bitcoin.


>> No.
 At
 this
 point,
 like
 I
 had
 like
 maybe


one
 Bitcoin.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 one
 Bitcoin
 is
 like
 only
 a


thousand
 bucks
 back
 then.
 Yeah.
 So,


Yeah.


>> So,
 then
 what
 happens?
 And
 then
 so
 but


and
 then
 so
 I
 tell
 my
 partner
 look
 I


think
 this
 is
 this
 is
 the
 biggest
 this


is
 the
 biggest
 thing
 in
 my
 life
 right
 so


when
 I
 think
 there's
 three
 fundamental


back
 then
 I
 realized
 there
 was
 like
 two


fundamental
 technologies
 in
 my
 life
 this


the
 internet
 I
 was
 too
 young
 to
 do
 too


much
 with
 it
 and
 there
 was
 this
 Bitcoin


thing
 and
 I
 wasn't
 I
 was
 35
 36
 I
 wasn't


going
 to
 miss
 it
 the
 next
 thing
 that's


going
 to
 come
 along
 is
 going
 to
 be
 15


years
 later


>> you
 feel
 old
 when
 you
 go
 to
 Vegas
 and


you
 see
 all
 these
 young
 22
 year old
 kids


and
 you're
 like
 I
 missed
 it
 did
 you


think
 that
 at
 any
 point
 or


>> no
 35
 36
 is
 still
 okay.
 Okay.
 So,
 it's


still
 like
 doable.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 you


don't
 feel
 super
 old.
 Today
 I
 feel
 that


>> but
 I
 thought
 the
 next
 thing
 that
 that


will
 come
 will
 be
 10
 15
 years
 later
 and


with
 that's
 AI,
 right?
 So,
 today
 I
 say


like
 there's
 three
 fundamental


technologies
 in
 my
 life.
 But
 back
 then


like
 that's
 the
 that's
 the
 that's
 the


thing,


>> right?


>> So
 for
 me
 it
 was
 very
 clear
 I
 got
 to
 I


got
 to
 do
 something
 in
 this
 industry,


>> right?


>> So
 u
 and
 uh
 so
 I
 told
 my
 partners
 look


I'm
 going
 to
 I'm
 going
 to
 I'm
 going
 to


quit
 uh
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 work
 in
 the


Bitcoin
 industry.
 That's
 what
 it's


called
 back
 then.
 And
 then
 um
 uh
 and


then
 I
 was
 I
 also
 need
 to
 buy
 Bitcoin


and
 I
 don't
 have
 many
 money
 so
 um
 I


don't
 have
 so
 I
 just
 I
 said
 look
 I'm


going
 to
 sell
 my
 apartment
 in
 Shanghai


and
 then
 buy
 Bitcoin
 but
 selling
 the


apartment
 takes
 time.
 So
 it
 took
 me
 like


a
 a
 solid
 few
 months
 to
 sell
 it
 and
 it


was
 it
 was
 only


>> you
 sold
 it
 where
 did
 you
 just
 got
 a


rental
 apartment?


>> I
 sold
 it
 at
 uh
 at
 the
 time
 actually
 my


family
 also
 moved
 to
 Tokyo.
 So
 my
 family


moved
 to
 Tokyo.
 We
 lived
 in
 a
 rental


apartment.
 Um
 so


>> in
 Tokyo


>> in
 Tokyo.
 Uh
 and
 then
 I
 was
 traveling
 in


Shanghai.
 So
 that's
 kind
 of the
 time
 I


started
 moving
 started
 separating
 from


uh
 from
 the
 from
 from
 the
 family
 as


well.
 So
 I
 was
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time


traveling,


>> right?


>> And
 uh
 so
 I
 sold
 the
 apartment
 and
 for


roughly
 $900,000
 like
 just
 under
 a


million
 bucks.
 Um,
 and
 then
 started


buying
 and
 I
 got
 paid
 in
 trenches


because,
 you
 know,
 you
 get
 a
 first
 down


payment,
 you
 got
 paid
 in
 trenches
 and


every
 trench
 I
 get,
 I
 just
 buy.
 The


first
 trench
 at
 $800
 and
 then
 Bitcoin
 is


dropping
 $600,
 $400.
 Kind
 of
 averaged
 to


about
 $600.


>> Incredible.
 Yeah.
 Incredible.


>> So
 now
 you
 have
 your
 Bitcoin
 position,


but
 you
 still
 don't
 have
 a
 job.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 was
 looking
 for
 a
 job
 at


the
 same
 time,
 but
 you
 were
 looking
 for


a
 job
 in
 the
 Bitcoin
 industry
 or
 you


were
 just
 looking
 for
 any
 job


>> in
 the
 Bitcoin
 industry.
 That
 was
 very


specific.
 Um,
 it
 didn't
 take
 me
 that


long
 to
 get
 a
 job.
 Uh
 you
 like
 the
 gap


was
 pro
 from
 the
 time
 I
 said
 I'm
 going


to
 quit
 until
 I
 finalized
 the
 job
 was


probably
 about
 two
 to
 three
 weeks.


>> Oh
 wow.
 Yeah.


>> And
 so
 who
 hired
 you?


>> I
 first
 discussed
 with
 BTCC
 Bobby
 he


wanted
 to
 hire
 me
 and
 then
 um
 uh
 but


then
 uh
 blockchain
 info
 came
 along.
 Uh
 I


bumped
 into
 Roger
 Ver
 so
 and
 then
 he
 at


the
 time
 blockchain
 uh
 blockchain
 info


was
 I
 was
 the
 third
 person
 to
 join
 the


blockchain
 info
 team.
 There
 was
 a
 uh
 Ben


Reefs
 who's
 a
 founder
 and
 there
 was


Nicholas
 Kerry
 who
 was
 just
 the
 C
 hired


the
 CEO


>> and
 I
 was
 like
 the
 third
 guy
 in
 so
 I
 was


like
 VP
 of
 engineering
 because
 Ben
 we


want
 to
 reserve
 the
 CO
 title
 for
 Ben.


>> So
 uh
 uh
 so
 yeah
 I
 joined
 I
 I
 joined
 uh


blockchain
 info.
 I
 flew
 to
 uh
 York
 in


London
 like
 three
 hours
 north
 of
 New
 uh


London.
 Um
 uh
 I
 spent
 some
 time
 there


you
 know
 figuring
 out
 what
 to
 do.
 Yeah.


>> And
 how
 did
 that
 go?


>> Uh
 that
 didn't
 go
 very
 well.
 We
 expanded


the
 team
 to
 18
 people
 and
 then
 um
 Peter


Smith
 joined
 uh
 as
 a
 CFO
 wanting
 to


raise
 money
 for
 blockchain
 evil.


Coinbase
 just
 finished
 raising
 at


raising
 around
 at
 30
 raising
 $30


million.
 Um
 and
 that
 was
 a
 big
 one
 in


the
 industry
 back
 then.
 Um
 Peter
 Smith


somehow
 maneuvered
 himself
 into
 the
 CEO


position
 pushing
 like
 Nicholas
 Kerry
 to


the
 product
 manager
 kind
 of
 role.
 Um
 but


the
 culture
 kind
 of
 changed
 a
 little


bit.
 So
 um
 uh
 I
 left
 um
 a
 bunch
 of
 the


developers
 I
 hired
 left
 um
 and
 then
 um


Ben
 Reef
 Ben
 Reef
 sold
 quite
 a
 lot
 of


his
 position
 also
 left
 in
 a
 few
 months


later.
 So
 that
 was
 that
 was
 my
 so
 that


was
 only
 like
 a
 few
 I
 think
 I
 was
 only


there
 for
 like
 uh
 six
 seven
 months.
 So


that
 didn't
 work
 out
 too
 well.
 Uh
 but
 I


learned
 a
 lot
 uh
 from
 that
 experience.


>> Yeah.
 You
 learn
 what
 not
 to
 do.
 No,
 they


all
 know
 like
 blockchain
 info
 when
 I


joined
 the
 the
 Baron
 Reeves
 said
 look
 we


have
 no
 company
 we
 have
 no
 office


everyone
 works
 remotely
 we
 just
 pay


everybody
 in
 Bitcoin
 and
 so
 that's


something
 I
 learned
 from
 that
 company


and
 I
 still
 look
 that's
 still
 very


heavily
 used
 in
 Binance
 today


>> so
 I
 learned
 a
 lot
 I
 also
 learned
 that


you
 know
 that
 company
 the
 whole


marketing
 they
 at
 the
 time
 blockchain


info
 was
 the
 largest
 user
 platform
 in


the
 industry
 right
 so
 they
 had
 about
 two


million
 wallets
 uh
 more
 than
 Coinbase
 at


the


And
 um
 uh
 the
 entire
 marketing
 was
 one


thread
 on
 bitcointtalk.org


one
 thread.
 The
 thread
 is
 150
 pages.
 Um


Ben
 Ree
 just
 replies
 to
 that
 thread
 and


that's
 how
 you
 grew
 to
 a
 2
 million
 user


platform.
 I
 was
 like
 okay
 so
 you
 can
 do


some
 you
 can
 do
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 guorilla


marketing
 to
 be
 successful.


>> Wow.


>> So
 I
 I
 learned
 a
 lot.
 U
 but
 the
 culture


changed
 a
 little
 bit.
 it
 wasn't
 fit
 for


for
 me
 and
 then
 I
 I
 left
 and
 then
 that


was
 when
 um


uh
 hired
 me
 into
 into
 okay
 coin.
 Yeah.


So
 I
 he
 said
 look
 why
 are
 you
 working


for
 this
 wallet
 company
 your
 experiences


dealing
 with
 order
 execution
 exchanges.


So
 so
 he
 hired
 me
 there


>> as
 a
 developer


>> as
 a
 CTO
 uh


>> as
 a
 CTO.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 so
 uh
 yeah
 so
 in
 the
 process
 I


think
 BTC
 China
 helped
 me
 again.


Uh
 so
 you
 know
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 looking
 for


a
 job
 again
 right
 so
 I
 left
 and
 then
 um


uh
 uh
 was
 talking
 to
 me
 and
 Bobby
 Lee


found
 out
 and
 Bobby
 Lee
 meant
 so
 okx


okay
 coin
 back
 then
 uh
 will
 offer
 me
 5%


equity
 um
 and
 then
 for
 uh
 sorry
 uh
 BTC


China
 came
 along
 and
 offered
 me
 10%


equity
 and
 then
 OKCoin
 matched
 it
 within


three
 hours
 and
 then
 I
 was
 debating


between
 Shanghai
 and
 Beijing
 and
 I


decided
 to
 go
 to
 Beijing
 to
 join
 OKCoin


back
 then
 uh
 Hu
 at
 that
 time
 had
 1%


equity
 Uh
 so
 she
 hired
 me
 to
 be
 like
 the


the
 the
 the
 bigger
 sort
 of
 partner
 in


the
 business.


>> Wow.


>> Um
 so
 that's
 that's
 how
 I
 went
 to
 OKCoin


um
 for
 about
 8
 months
 or
 so.
 Um
 that


didn't
 last
 long
 either.


>> Yeah.
 Because


>> I
 think
 there
 were
 also
 culture


differences
 um
 at
 OKCoin.
 Um
 uh
 there


were
 some
 stuff
 that
 I
 didn't
 agree


with.
 Um
 both
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 you
 know


simple
 examples
 like
 how
 they
 run


promotions,
 how
 they
 how
 they
 do
 fee


discounts
 uh
 where
 you
 have
 to
 ask
 for


it
 like
 they
 they
 advertise
 a
 fee


discount
 but
 you
 have
 to
 ask
 for
 it
 to


get
 it.
 It
 doesn't
 apply
 to
 everybody


even
 though
 they
 advertise
 as
 such.


>> So
 small
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 then
 um


so
 yeah,
 so
 that
 was
 in
 early
 2015
 I


said
 no
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 leave.
 Um,
 so


that's
 kind
 of
 a
 uh
 so
 that
 lasted
 for
 a


few
 months
 uh
 in
 2015.
 Yeah.
 2014


mostly.
 Yeah.
 So
 how
 do
 we
 get
 from


there
 to
 Binance?


>> So
 2015
 um
 I
 I
 with
 a
 couple
 of
 my
 old


colleagues
 said
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 a


Bitcoin
 exchange
 in
 um
 in
 Tokyo
 in
 Japan


because
 this
 is
 uh
 a
 year
 after


>> after
 Mount
 Gaus
 and
 all
 that.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 a
 vacuum
 in
 Japan.
 So


um
 we
 got
 two
 developers
 that
 came
 to
 me


on
 the
 same
 day
 I
 decided
 to
 leave


OKCoin.
 they
 came
 to
 me
 said
 look
 we


somehow
 they
 also
 quit
 their
 pre


respective
 jobs.
 Um
 I
 said
 okay
 well
 why


don't
 with
 the
 three
 of
 us
 do
 something


and
 so
 I
 we
 said
 okay
 so
 I
 will
 I
 will


be
 the
 CEO
 and
 then
 I'll
 be
 the
 big
 guy


uh
 with
 more
 equity
 and
 then
 I'll
 be
 uh


responsible
 for
 raising
 u
 I
 and
 I
 was


paying
 them
 a
 salary
 out
 of
 my
 own


savings
 um
 and
 I
 wasn't
 taking
 anything.


So
 the
 two
 developers
 uh
 we
 we
 whipped


up
 a
 demo
 very
 quickly.
 We
 downloaded
 an


open
 source
 software
 for
 an
 exchange
 and


then
 uh
 we
 tweaked
 the
 UI
 to
 be
 a
 little


bit
 sexier
 and
 then
 uh
 we
 hooked
 up.


>> You
 just
 forked
 an
 open
 source
 project


like
 this
 is
 our
 this
 is
 Binance.


>> No,
 we
 we
 didn't
 say
 it
 was
 Binance.


Yeah,
 this
 is
 before
 this
 is
 before


Minance.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 we
 didn't
 say
 we
 I
 was
 very


transparent.
 I
 was
 like
 this
 we
 whipped


up
 this
 demo
 up
 in
 two
 days
 or
 in
 a
 few


days.


>> Um
 and
 this
 is
 a
 demo
 that
 we
 can
 show


you.
 But
 this
 is
 not
 our


>> the
 ultimate
 product.
 It's
 just
 it's


just
 a
 proof
 of
 concept
 just
 Yeah.
 So
 um


it's
 like
 uh
 yeah
 so
 and
 then
 but
 and


then
 we
 had
 a
 script
 that
 took
 Bitfinex


uh
 market
 data.
 Bitfinex
 was
 like
 a
 the


large
 exchange
 back
 then
 and
 we
 just


kind
 of
 copy
 their
 order
 book
 and
 the


order
 book
 was
 flashing
 there's
 trades


going
 on.
 So
 it
 was
 a
 very
 lively
 demo


and
 when
 the
 investors
 saw
 that
 it
 was


like
 wow
 this
 is
 good
 technology


but
 it's
 not
 just
 a
 demo
 it's
 it's
 it's


a
 when
 they
 ask
 me
 questions
 I
 can


answer
 in
 very
 deep
 ways
 right
 when
 they


ask
 me
 like
 you
 know
 how
 do
 how
 do
 you


structure
 this
 to
 be
 a
 fast
 uh
 exchange


we
 I
 can
 talk
 about
 know
 in
 memory
 uh


matching
 um
 uh
 optimizing
 database
 all


all
 the
 all
 the
 stuff
 you've
 learned


>> yeah
 so
 I
 can
 go
 really
 deep
 when
 they


ask
 questions
 right
 so
 the
 my
 my


knowledge
 is
 there


>> right


>> so
 they
 were
 like
 uh
 They
 were
 like,


"Okay,
 this
 technology
 is
 cool,
 but
 you


could
 you
 won't
 you
 won't
 be
 successful


running
 a
 crypto
 bitcoin
 exchange
 in


Japan.
 You
 don't
 speak
 Japanese,
 right?"


I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 they
 have
 a
 point."


Um,
 so
 they
 said,
 "Why
 don't
 you
 sell


the
 this
 technology
 to
 other
 exchanges


because
 most
 of
 the
 Japanese
 exchanges


don't
 have
 very
 good
 technology."
 Um,
 I


was
 like,
 "Okay."
 So
 then
 I
 went
 to
 talk


to
 a
 few
 of
 the
 exchanges.
 Like


literally
 two
 weeks
 later,
 we
 signed
 a


contract
 with
 one
 of
 the
 with
 one
 of
 the


exchanges
 and
 then
 they
 paid
 30
 $360,000


for
 the
 for
 the
 system.
 Uh
 so
 they
 made


a
 down
 payment
 of
 100
 $180,000.


Um
 that
 was
 enough
 for
 me
 not
 to
 pay


salaries
 anymore.
 So
 I
 was
 happy
 with


that.
 So
 uh
 we
 pivoted
 from
 a
 wanting
 to


run
 a
 our
 own
 Bitcoin
 exchange
 to
 a


exchange
 systems
 for
 provider.


>> Yeah.
 You're
 selling
 software.


>> Uh
 we
 we're
 selling
 software.
 And
 then


um
 in
 July
 2015,
 a
 bunch
 of
 Chinese
 uh


uh
 companies
 came
 to
 us
 saying
 they
 want


systems
 for


>> Can
 I
 just
 say
 by
 the
 way,
 sorry
 to


interrupt
 you,
 but
 it's
 really


incredible
 because
 there
 are
 so
 many


founder
 stories
 when
 somebody
 says,


"I've
 started
 a
 company."
 And
 then


somebody
 says,
 "Well,
 how
 much
 is
 it


worth
 or
 how
 successful
 is
 it?"
 And
 you


know,
 let's
 just
 say
 Binance
 is
 a
 $200


billion
 company,


>> probably
 less
 than
 that,
 but


>> it's
 in
 the
 neighborhood.


A
 lot
 of
 people
 think
 that
 there
 is
 some


incredible
 origin
 story
 that
 is
 like


lightning
 in
 a
 bottle.
 But
 so
 often
 than


not,
 the
 story
 is
 more
 yours,
 which
 is


this.
 It's
 kind
 of
 like
 moving
 along,


meandering,
 learning
 things,
 trying
 some


other
 things,


>> this
 non-obvious
 iteration,
 and
 then
 all


of
 a
 sudden


>> things
 kind
 of
 catalyze.
 But
 even
 then,


you
 still
 don't
 get
 the
 right
 form


because
 you're
 licensing
 it
 really.
 And


people
 just
 misunderstand
 that
 this
 is


actually
 more
 what
 entrepreneurship
 is.


It's
 the
 resilience
 and
 the
 grit
 to
 just


keep
 grinding.


>> For
 sure.
 For
 sure.
 I
 think
 most
 most


people
 idealize
 like,
 you
 know,
 um


entrepreneurship
 that
 they
 just
 hate
 it


and
 they
 they
 they


>> it's
 like
 the
 Facebook
 story.
 You
 hack


it
 together
 in
 college
 and
 oh
 it's
 now
 a


million
 users.


>> It's
 Facebook
 is
 is is
 Microsoft,
 right?


Exactly.
 And
 also
 Google
 this
 three
 are


like
 you
 know
 college
 uh
 garage
 and
 they


just


>> Exactly.
 Even
 but
 the
 reality
 Binance
 or


Tesla
 it's
 like
 a
 grind.
 It's
 it's
 a


grind
 and
 it's
 a
 grind.


>> You
 have
 to
 like
 go
 so
 many
 different


ways


>> and
 it
 wasn't
 obvious
 from
 the


beginning.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 So
 I
 think
 those
 three
 are
 the


exceptions
 that
 kind
 of
 just
 hit
 it
 from


day
 one.


>> Exactly.


>> Um
 but
 then
 that
 kind
 of
 shaped
 the


people's
 perception
 like
 99%
 99.9%
 of


other
 business
 successful
 businesses
 are


not
 like
 that.


>> Right.


>> Right.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 now
 any
 other


successful
 company.
 Yeah.
 So
 the
 same


same
 here.


>> So
 get
 us
 to
 the
 founding
 moment.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 did


>> so
 you're
 licensing
 the
 software.


>> We
 licensed
 the
 software.
 We
 that


business
 went
 pretty
 well.
 So,
 we've
 had


like
 30
 different
 exchange
 clients.


>> Wait,
 no
 way.


>> Like
 over
 over
 like


>> over
 multiple
 years.


>> Over
 two
 years.
 In
 two
 years,
 we
 signed


up.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 multi-million
 dollar


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Yeah.


>> licensing
 business.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 and
 it's
 a
 SAS
 business,


right?
 What
 we
 call
 exchange
 as
 a


service
 uh
 business.
 So,
 we
 charge
 a


fixed
 monthly
 fee
 every
 month.
 And
 this


is
 platform
 business
 is
 paying
 us.
 It's


very
 steady
 business.
 Every
 new
 client


we
 So,
 every
 new
 client
 increases
 the


the
 revenue.
 So,
 every
 new
 client
 is


like
 a
 step
 up.


>> Exactly.
 So
 it's
 a
 very
 actually
 a
 very


very
 good
 business
 model.
 But
 then
 in


March
 2017
 uh
 the
 Chinese
 government


shut
 down
 most
 of
 our
 clients.
 Uh
 and


then
 um
 and
 then
 by
 May
 we're
 like


>> right
 and
 they
 don't
 touch
 you
 because


you're
 the
 software
 vendor


>> with
 a
 software
 vendor.
 Exactly.
 We


don't
 run
 any
 business.
 So
 with
 a


software
 vendor
 so
 um
 but
 then
 our


businesses
 we
 don't
 we
 have
 no
 clients


right.
 So
 uh
 we
 lost
 our
 clients
 and
 so


by
 May
 we
 were
 like
 okay
 we
 need
 to


pivot.
 Um
 well
 by
 April
 May
 we
 were
 like


figure
 out
 how
 to
 pivot.
 Um
 by
 end
 of


May
 we
 was
 like
 okay
 uh
 actually
 three


guys
 who
 worked
 for
 me
 said
 they
 want
 to


do
 a
 Polon
 next
 copycat.
 Polex
 was
 the


biggest
 uh
 exchange
 back
 then.
 Um
 and


then
 I
 said
 let's
 let
 me
 invest.
 We
 have


some
 extra
 cash.
 Three
 days
 later
 they


want
 to
 do
 some
 onchain
 chat
 trading


software.
 Was
 like
 no
 we're
 not
 going
 to


invest
 in
 that
 anymore.
 Um
 and
 then
 I


said
 well
 why
 don't
 we
 do
 that?
 We
 have


the
 exchange
 system
 already.
 Uh
 we
 still


need
 to
 customize
 it
 to
 do
 a
 cryptoto


crypto
 only
 trading.


>> My
 gosh.
 So
 in
 May
 we
 said
 okay
 uh
 we're


going
 to
 do
 a
 crypto
 we're
 gonna
 do
 an


exchange
 again.
 Um
 the
 team
 said
 fine
 uh


sure.


>> How
 big
 is
 the
 team
 at
 this
 point?


>> 20
 people.
 So
 um
 and
 we
 had
 tech
 people.


We
 don't
 have
 marketing
 because
 we
 are


to
 be
 business
 right.
 We
 we
 have
 we
 have


two
 sales
 guys
 two
 sales
 guys
 plus
 me.


>> Um
 and
 then
 uh
 we
 said
 well
 now
 we
 can


run
 our
 own
 let's
 let's
 do
 our
 own


cryptoto
 crypto
 exchange.
 Um
 so
 and
 then


so
 that
 was
 the
 end
 of
 May
 and
 then
 June


1st
 to
 June
 10th
 uh
 there
 was
 a
 guy
 who


who
 was
 a
 BTC
 co-founder
 uh
 Link
 he
 ran


an
 ICO
 in
 China
 he
 raised
 15
 million
 US


dollars
 in
 in
 10
 days
 and
 with
 and
 then


I
 looked
 at
 him
 I
 was
 like
 I
 was
 like
 he


only
 had
 a
 white
 he
 only
 had
 one


document
 and
 one
 website
 no
 product


nothing
 he
 raised
 $15
 million
 US
 if
 if


he
 can
 do
 that
 I
 might
 be
 able
 to
 do


that
 too


>> you
 need
 aded
 venture
 funding
 you're


like
 if
 I
 get
 the
 $1
 million.
 I
 can


build
 out
 a
 team.
 I
 can
 invest
 in
 some


marketing.
 I
 can
 be
 in
 the
 J
 curve
 and


not
 feel
 the
 pressure.


>> Exactly.
 Yeah.
 So,
 originally
 we
 were


going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 VC
 funding
 route,


right?
 But
 then
 when
 I
 saw
 that,
 I
 was


like,
 well,
 and
 and
 and
 everyone
 talking


about
 ICOs
 back
 then.
 Uh
 I
 went
 to
 like


I
 went
 to
 a
 conference
 uh
 mid
 June
 uh


2017
 and
 everyone
 was
 talking
 about
 ICO.


Everyone's
 like,
 CZ,
 you
 got
 to
 do
 an


ICO.
 You
 got
 to
 do
 an
 ICO.
 So,
 um
 by
 mid


June
 uh
 June
 14th
 was
 the
 date.
 And
 then


I
 said,
 okay,
 called
 the
 team
 said
 we're


going to
 do
 an
 ICO.
 write
 a
 white
 paper


and
 then
 by


>> and
 so
 did
 you
 have
 a
 name
 at
 that
 point


like
 in
 the
 Bitcoin
 community
 or
 in
 the


crypto
 community
 either
 in
 China
 or
 in


Japan
 or
 somewhere


>> I
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 name
 even


working
 at
 blockchain
 info
 uh
 uh
 quite
 a


lot
 of
 people
 know
 me
 uh
 blockchain
 info


was
 the
 most
 popular
 platform
 back
 then


right


>> and
 OKCoin
 was
 also
 like
 I
 was
 a
 CTO
 I


was
 quite
 I
 was
 quite
 active
 on
 social


media
 um
 I
 was
 also
 kind
 of
 managing


their
 international
 markets
 non-English


speaking
 or
 non-Chinese
 speaking
 markets


because
 nobody
 else
 I
 was
 the
 best


English
 speaker
 on
 that
 me
 even
 though


my
 English
 is
 not
 that
 great
 but
 uh
 so
 I


had
 a
 I
 had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 a
 name
 uh


uh
 people
 know
 uh
 people
 know
 me
 in
 the


community


>> because
 you
 needed
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 name
 or


some
 kind
 of
 pedigree
 to
 actually
 do
 an


ICO
 at
 this
 point.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 but
 this
 is
 a


advantage
 of
 when
 you
 get
 involved
 early


in
 the
 industry
 like
 you
 go
 to
 a
 few


conferences
 like
 there's
 200
 people
 and


you
 go
 to
 like
 by
 the
 second
 time
 you
 go


there
 people
 know
 you
 right


>> but
 the
 third
 time
 is
 people
 like
 oh
 you


know


>> you're
 the
 expert
 already
 right
 so
 u
 so


I
 had
 a
 I
 had
 I
 had
 a
 bit
 of
 a


reputation
 uh
 so
 I
 thought
 that
 link


quite
 the
 guy
 who
 did
 the
 ICO
 in
 China


he's
 quite
 well
 known
 in
 China
 but
 he's


not
 known
 internationally
 I
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 both
 so
 I
 said
 well
 I
 can


probably
 do
 an
 ICO
 and
 raise
 the
 same


amount
 so
 we
 Uh,
 and
 um,


>> so
 who
 are
 the
 buyers
 of
 the
 Binance


ICO?


>> To
 be
 honest,
 even
 to
 this
 day,
 I
 don't


know.


>> Even
 to
 this
 day,
 you
 don't
 know,


>> right?
 It's
 like
 I
 think,


>> but
 are
 they
 Chinese?
 Are
 they
 Japanese?


Are
 they
 people
 from
 all
 around
 the


world
 that
 kind
 of
 knew
 you?
 Was
 it
 that


your
 white
 paper
 was
 really
 good?


>> Okay.
 So,
 I
 think
 in
 terms
 of


demographic,
 it's
 probably
 like
 80
 the


ICO
 purchases
 were
 probably
 80
 80
 to
 90%


Chinese.
 And
 there
 were
 some
 like


international
 guys
 who
 who
 bought
 it.


Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 the
 data
 shows
 that


there
 was
 about
 20 20,000
 people
 who


bought
 in
 the
 ICO.


>> 20,000
 people.


>> 20,000
 people.
 So,
 and
 this
 is
 like
 a


brand
 new
 brand.
 Uh,
 some
 people
 know
 me


in
 the
 industry
 and
 that
 was
 it.


>> So,
 even
 though
 the
 exchanges
 were
 put


out
 of
 business
 in
 China,


>> yeah,


>> the
 ICO
 was
 allowed.


>> No,
 the
 ICO
 wasn't
 banned
 back
 then.


>> Wasn't
 banned.


>> Yeah.


>> It
 was
 not
 not
 allowed.


>> It
 was
 not
 not
 allowed.
 Exactly.
 So,
 let


me
 let
 me
 let
 me
 let
 me
 just
 make
 one


clarification.
 The
 exchange
 clients
 that


that
 we
 were
 serving
 were
 mostly
 stamp


uh
 cultures
 exchanges,
 not
 crypto


exchanges.
 Okay.


>> Crypto
 exchanges
 were
 not
 banned
 in


March.
 Crypto
 exchanges
 were
 banned


after
 we
 started.


>> I
 see.


>> So
 uh
 that
 was
 in
 September.
 We're


talking
 about
 like
 June,
 July
 kind
 of


2017.


>> Wow.
 You're
 really
 threading
 a
 needle.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 I
 we
 didn't
 know
 that


that
 B
 was
 coming.
 We
 just
 thought
 like


you
 know
 those


>> How
 much
 of
 the
 company
 did
 you
 sell?


>> No,
 we
 didn't
 have
 we
 we
 just
 the
 coins.


>> We
 launched
 the
 token.


>> You
 had
 to
 do
 no
 equity
 participation.


There's
 no
 there's
 no
 equity
 that


there's
 no
 equity
 uh
 involved.
 So
 we


just
 we
 launched
 a
 new
 token
 B&B
 is


still
 there
 today


>> and
 then
 we
 said
 look
 we're
 going to


sell
 uh
 we're
 going
 to
 sell
 60%
 of
 it


for
 $15
 million


>> roughly.
 Right.
 So
 uh
 because
 we're


tokening
 bitcoins


>> and
 what
 were
 the
 original
 tokconomics


that
 you
 designed
 for
 the
 B&B
 token?


>> Well,
 we
 said
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 but
 the


main
 one
 that
 was
 going
 to
 be
 live
 very


quickly
 was
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 if
 you
 hold


B&B
 you
 receive
 50%
 fee
 discounts
 when


you
 trade
 on
 Binance
 eventually
 the


platform
 that
 gets
 launched.
 Um,
 that


was
 the
 main
 thing.
 But
 we
 also
 said,


look,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 it's
 going
 to


have
 eventually
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 its


own
 chain,
 it
 own
 decentralized


ecosystem.
 There's
 like
 three
 or
 four


things.


>> So
 then
 you
 guys
 must
 have
 been


ecstatic.
 You're
 like,
 wow,
 we
 raised
 15


million
 bucks.
 We're
 now
 going
 to
 launch


this
 exchange.
 But
 then
 September
 comes


around
 and
 then
 exchanges
 themselves.


So
 then
 what
 do
 you
 do?


>> Yeah.
 September
 comes
 around.
 September


4th,
 the
 like
 seven
 different


departments
 of
 Chinese
 government
 issued


a
 memo
 together
 saying
 that
 number
 one


exch
 crypto
 exchanges
 are
 no
 longer


allowed
 in
 China.
 ICOs
 are
 no
 longer


allowed.
 Mining
 is
 not
 allowed,
 crypto


mining.
 Uh
 we
 said,
 well,
 we're
 gonna


move.
 Well,
 we
 said
 uh
 we
 have
 to
 move.


Uh
 by
 then
 it
 was
 clear
 that
 even
 while


at
 the
 time
 China
 was
 one
 of the
 do
 the


the
 largest
 user
 base,
 uh
 they
 have
 like


30
 something%
 user
 base
 from
 China,
 but


we
 still
 have
 like
 70%
 from
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world.
 We
 said,
 look,
 if
 we
 cut
 off


that
 30%,
 we
 can
 still
 survive.
 We
 can


we
 can
 we
 actually
 survive
 pretty
 well.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 we
 said,
 well,
 I
 just
 said,


"Look,
 let's
 move.
 Let's
 move.
 Uh,
 let's


move
 to
 Tokyo."


>> Back
 to
 Tokyo.


>> Back
 to
 Tokyo,
 right?


>> You
 love
 Tokyo.


>> I
 I
 I've
 been
 I've
 been
 back
 in
 and
 out


of
 Tokyo.
 I
 know
 it.


>> And
 by
 the
 way,
 at
 that
 point,
 do
 you


speak
 Japanese
 as
 well?


>> I
 speak
 very
 little
 Japanese.
 Uh
 what
 I


call
 taxi
 Japanese.
 I
 can
 I
 can
 say


like,
 "No,
 thank
 you.
 Go
 left,
 go


right."
 In
 a
 restaurant,
 I
 when
 I
 order,


I
 say
 this,
 this,
 this,
 not
 the
 not
 the


full
 menu
 names.


>> Yeah.


>> Sushi,
 I
 can
 name
 most
 of
 them.


>> Okay.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 that's
 my
 Japanese
 level.
 But


you
 know
 I
 know
 Japan,
 I
 know
 Tokyo.
 It


wasn't
 it's
 not
 like
 a
 new
 country
 for


me,
 right?
 So
 I
 said
 like
 let's
 move
 to


Tokyo.
 And
 we
 had
 like
 30
 people
 then,


right?
 So


>> and
 everybody
 moved.


>> Everybody
 moved.


>> Wow.


>> Back
 then
 um
 eight
 years
 ago
 I
 think


very
 like
 maybe
 one
 or
 two
 of
 the
 people


were
 married.
 Uh
 and
 nobody
 had
 kids.
 Uh


so
 it
 was
 like
 a
 very
 easy
 move
 for
 the


team.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 everybody
 just
 packed


up
 and
 moved.
 I
 remember
 one
 girl
 cried,


one
 product
 manager,
 she
 cried
 because


her
 her
 boyfriend
 is
 in
 is
 in
 China.
 So


she
 cried
 but
 she
 moved
 with
 us
 and
 u


she's
 not
 married
 to
 her
 boyfriend.
 So


anyway,


>> incredible.


>> So
 yeah,
 so
 we
 moved
 to
 Tokyo
 like
 u


when
 China
 did
 that
 um
 and
 uh
 our


platform
 continue
 to
 grow.
 Yeah.


>> So
 when
 you
 first
 launched
 Binance,
 was


it
 an
 instant
 hit
 or
 did
 it
 take
 energy


to
 find
 that
 product
 market
 fit?
 at


first
 few
 zealous
 users
 that
 would
 tell


everybody
 else
 like
 how
 did
 the
 verality


start?
 How
 did
 the
 liquidity
 really
 get


built?


>> So,
 Binance
 I
 would
 say
 the
 product
 was


growing
 pretty
 well
 but
 the
 token
 price


went
 down
 uh
 from
 ICO
 price
 it
 went
 down


30
 40%.
 It
 took
 about
 3
 weeks
 to


recover.
 Uh
 so,
 uh
 when
 we
 launched
 the


product
 uh
 because
 at
 that
 time
 crypto


is
 still
 pretty
 hot.
 I
 think
 we
 the


product
 market
 fit
 was
 there.
 Um
 it


wasn't
 a
 new
 idea.
 It's
 just
 a
 cryptoto


crypto
 exchange.
 So
 then
 the
 ICO
 was


critical
 then,
 right?
 Because
 these


people
 say,
 "Well,
 I
 own
 this
 token
 now.


I
 can
 trade
 at
 a
 fee
 discount."


>> Yeah.


>> So
 that's
 why
 I'm
 going
 to
 choose


Binance.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 was
 it
 also
 architected
 better?
 Was


it
 materially
 faster
 or
 more
 reliable?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 For
 sure


>> it
 was.


>> It
 was.
 So
 back
 then
 uh
 when
 we
 launched


you
 can
 even
 even
 using
 your
 eyeballs,


you
 can
 see
 that
 placing
 an
 order
 on


Binance
 is
 so
 much
 faster
 than
 on


competing
 platform.


>> And
 so
 the
 performance
 of
 of
 the


exchange
 system
 was
 visible.
 Back
 then


2017,
 who
 were
 the
 big
 platforms
 that


you
 were
 competing
 with?


>> There
 was
 Polonex,
 Bitrex
 were
 the


biggest
 ones
 and
 then
 there's
 a
 few


Chinese
 ones.
 There's
 Hobi,
 OKX,
 uh,


OKCoin
 back
 then.
 Um,
 and
 then
 in
 the


Western
 world,
 Coinbase
 was
 there.
 Um,


Gemini
 was
 Gemini
 wasn't
 there
 back


then.
 Um,
 Gemini
 was
 later.
 Um,
 so


Bitstamp
 was
 there.
 Uh,
 Bitfinex
 was


there.
 Um,
 now
 they're
 kind
 of
 really


really
 small.


>> So
 you're
 now
 in
 your
 late
 30s.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 this
 thing
 is
 working.


>> 40s
 now.


>> 40s,
 sorry.
 40s.
 How
 did
 you
 internalize


the
 success?
 You're
 like,
 "What
 is


this?"
 Like,
 "What
 what's
 happening?"


Like,
 "Are
 you
 saying
 that
 to
 yourself


or


>> Yeah,
 there
 were
 some
 really
 surreal


moments
 where
 you
 were
 like,
 is
 this


real?"


>> Yeah.


>> In
 a
 good
 way.
 Said
 like,
 "How
 like


what's
 our
 revenue?"


>> She
 I
 forgot
 the
 number,
 but
 she
 said


like
 a
 couple
 a
 couple
 hundred
 bitcoins.


Like,
 that's
 crazy.
 We
 can't
 be
 making


like
 are
 you
 sure?
 She's
 like,
 "Yeah,


we're
 sure."
 Like,
 "No,
 this
 number


can't
 be
 correct.
 We
 must
 be
 off
 by
 like


a
 magnitude."
 And
 we
 double
 check,


double
 check,
 triple
 check
 like
 correct.


I
 was
 like,
 that's
 crazy.
 And
 then
 there


was
 also
 a
 period
 where
 three
 weeks
 in


uh
 when
 the
 B&B
 price
 was
 recovering.
 So


B&B
 ICOed
 at
 like
 about
 10
 cents.
 It


dropped
 to
 like
 0.0
 uh
 up
 dropped
 to
 6


cents.
 And
 then
 um
 uh
 Hi
 join,
 we


announced
 Hi
 joining
 and
 then
 for
 the


next
 two
 three
 weeks
 um
 every
 time
 I
 you


know
 you
 go
 to
 sleep,
 you
 wake
 up
 the


token
 is
 up
 20%.
 You
 go
 to
 a
 meeting


come
 up
 the
 token
 up
 20%.
 You
 go
 to
 the


bathroom,
 come
 back,
 and
 tokens
 up
 20%.


>> I
 mean,
 it
 must
 have
 been
 very
 quick


where
 you're
 like,
 wait
 a
 minute,
 I'm


rich.


>> That
 came
 a
 little
 bit
 later.
 That
 came


in
 early
 2018,
 about
 six,
 seven,
 seven,


eight
 months
 in.
 Forbes
 put
 me
 on
 the


cover.


>> Uh,
 that's
 when
 like,
 well,
 I
 said,


well,


>> how
 did
 they
 even
 know
 to
 find
 you
 at


that
 time
 to
 put
 you
 on
 the
 cover?


>> I
 actually
 don't
 know,
 but
 Forbes
 was


doing
 a
 crypto
 edition.
 I
 see.
 So
 with


all
 the
 crypto
 guys
 and
 then
 um
 they


already
 had
 a
 picture
 of
 Italic
 doing
 a


fancy
 hand
 gesture
 which
 is
 really
 cool


picture.
 So
 um
 yeah
 so
 uh
 yeah
 so
 they


they
 invited
 us
 they
 they
 contacted
 our


PR
 department
 which
 maintains
 contact


with
 them
 uh
 which
 is
 really
 team
 back


then
 um
 like
 team
 of
 four
 or
 five
 girls


um
 and
 H
 says
 like
 well
 Forbes
 want
 to


do
 a
 special
 feature
 with
 you
 and
 take


some
 photos
 I
 think
 you
 should
 go.
 I
 was


like,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go.
 But
 I
 said,


we're
 a
 new
 brand.
 Forbes
 can
 still
 help


us,
 you
 know,
 uh,
 increase
 the
 brand


>> with
 awareness.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 I
 said,
 okay,
 fine.
 I'll


go.
 So,
 I
 went
 to
 do
 the
 photo
 shoot.


That
 was
 like
 my
 first
 photo
 like
 to
 put


makeup
 on
 me
 and
 then
 the
 first
 time
 put


makeup.


>> Cy,
 what
 is
 what
 is
 money?


>> Well,
 is
 it
 important?
 I
 mean,
 don't


take
 this
 wrong
 way,
 but


>> you
 got
 rich
 old.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 did
 it
 matter
 at
 that
 point?
 What
 is


money
 when
 you're
 in
 your
 40s
 and
 you


make
 it?


>> It
 still
 matter.
 Uh,
 but
 money
 is
 not


everything.
 I
 think
 I
 was
 old
 enough


that
 there's
 a
 couple
 things
 that


happened
 to
 me.
 Number
 one
 is
 I
 was


older
 as
 like
 40ome.
 So
 I'm
 not
 like
 a


young
 20-year-old
 that
 just
 you
 know


Lambos,
 big
 parties.


>> Too
 old
 for
 that.
 Uh
 so
 I
 have
 also
 my


personality
 is
 quite
 stable.
 So
 I
 don't


get
 too
 excited
 on
 things.


>> Um
 also
 the
 other
 thing
 not
 to
 brag
 but


uh
 I
 went
 from
 like
 a
 barely
 financially


free
 to
 like
 know
 cover
 forbes
 and
 I
 was


like
 wait
 a
 second
 like
 how
 how
 how
 rich


am
 I?
 I
 don't
 even
 know.
 I
 don't
 like


when
 I
 look
 at
 my
 wallet
 nothing
 changed


like
 Forbes
 Carver
 nothing
 changed
 for


me.
 Um
 but
 then
 people
 say
 look
 now
 you


might
 be
 a
 billionaire.
 I
 was
 like
 am
 I


really
 a
 billionaire?
 Like
 it
 doesn't


feel
 that
 way.
 I
 was
 like
 even
 like
 a


month
 ago
 like
 not
 a
 month
 like
 at
 that


time
 when
 when
 we
 fled
 well
 when
 we
 left


China
 to
 go
 to
 Japan
 uh
 I
 booked
 economy


classes
 for
 a
 redeye
 flight
 and
 he
 was


like
 no
 maybe
 we
 should
 upgrade
 to
 a


business
 class
 so
 we
 can
 lay
 down
 and


sleep.
 Okay
 that
 makes
 sense.
 That's
 you


know
 so
 like
 I
 have
 those
 kind
 of


habits.
 So
 uh
 when
 you
 make
 money


successively
 like
 you
 know
 you
 from
 one


from
 1
 million
 you
 become
 10
 million
 you


might
 want
 to
 buy
 some
 fancy
 cars
 from


to
 100
 million
 you
 might
 want
 to
 buy
 a


you
 know
 some
 yacht
 or
 something
 to
 a


billion
 then
 you
 have
 I
 didn't
 go


through
 that
 stepwise
 process.
 I
 just


went
 from
 like
 a
 relatively
 okay
 kind
 of


thing
 to
 like
 you're
 on
 the
 cover
 of


Forbes.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 um
 and
 so
 I
 didn't
 develop
 quite
 a


lot
 of
 those
 habits.


>> What
 does
 it
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 now?
 Now,


I
 mean,
 depending
 on
 the
 day,


>> yeah,


>> you're
 a
 deca
 billionaire
 or
 a


centiionaire.
 What
 does
 it
 all
 mean?


>> I
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 very
 much
 to
 me.
 I


think
 money
 is
 two
 things.
 Number
 one,


you
 you
 have
 to
 take
 care
 of
 yourself.


You
 have
 to
 have
 food,
 shelter,
 you


know,


>> which
 is
 very
 minimal
 amount
 of
 money.


>> Very
 minimal.
 Like
 you
 don't
 need
 that


much
 for
 that.


>> Yeah.
 People
 can
 confuse
 themselves
 and


create
 all
 kinds
 of
 complexity,
 but
 it


doesn't
 take
 much.


>> It
 doesn't
 take
 much.
 Um,
 so
 that
 I
 for


sure
 have.
 So,
 I
 have
 I
 have
 a
 very
 I


don't
 have
 a
 luxury
 life,
 but
 I
 have
 a


very
 comfortable
 life,
 I
 think.
 Um,
 and


then
 the
 other


>> Sorry,
 what
 does
 that
 mean?


>> If
 you
 look
 at
 my
 house,
 my
 my
 house


like
 the
 living
 room
 water
 leaks
 every


month
 or
 so
 because
 the
 the
 house
 is
 too


so
 old.
 But
 that's
 the
 house
 that
 has


that's
 the
 right
 size
 for
 me
 at
 right


now.
 Um,
 no,
 it's
 not.
 We'll
 just
 fix
 it


whenever
 it
 leaks.
 U,
 so
 that
 that
 still


happens
 like
 that
 happened
 a
 month
 ago.


So
 like
 people
 think
 I
 live
 in
 a
 very


fancy
 house,
 you
 know,
 all
 this
 other


craz,


you
 know,
 it
 kind
 of
 fits
 all
 my
 family


members.
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 but
 it's
 not
 a
 it's
 a
 old
 house
 uh


that
 I
 bought
 third
 or
 fourth
 hand,
 but


it's
 it's
 in
 the
 right
 location.
 It


works
 for
 me.
 It's
 in
 the
 right


location.
 It's
 functional.
 Um,
 things


break
 once
 in
 a
 while.
 It's
 fine.


>> Would
 you
 say
 it's
 because
 you're


practical
 or
 is
 it
 just
 because
 you're


just
 not
 moved
 by


>> I'm
 function
 driven.


>> You're
 function
 driven.


>> If
 it
 functions,
 I'm
 okay.
 I
 I
 don't


care
 about
 the
 fanciness.
 I
 don't
 care


about
 style.
 I
 don't
 care
 about
 colors.


I
 don't
 care
 about
 glitting
 gold.
 And
 if


it's
 functional,
 I'm
 okay.


>> Right.
 So,
 uh,
 if
 it
 if
 it
 solves
 the


problem,
 I'm
 good.


>> Do
 you
 ever
 have
 bouts
 of
 insecurity?


>> Uh,


not
 really.
 I'm
 I
 I
 know
 my
 weaknesses,


so
 and
 I
 learned
 to
 deal
 with
 it.
 So,


uh,
 I'm
 not
 I
 hope
 I'm
 not
 super


arrogant.
 Uh,
 so
 I
 don't
 think
 I'm


arrogant.


>> I've
 only
 gotten
 to
 know
 you
 in
 the
 last


couple
 years.


>> Yeah.
 I
 saw
 videos
 of
 you,
 I
 think
 it


was
 in
 the
 late
 teens,
 early
 2000s,


and
 my
 immediate
 reaction
 because
 that's


always
 been
 my
 struggle
 is
 sort
 of
 these


bouts
 of
 insecurity,
 ego.
 I
 thought,


man,
 this
 guy's
 really
 calm.


>> Yeah.
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 calm.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 described
 this
 way.


>> Very
 well
 reggulated,
 very
 self-aware,


it
 seems.


>> Yeah.
 Other
 people's
 emotions
 may
 go


like
 this
 like
 happy,
 sad,
 happy.
 I'll


feel
 happy,
 sad,
 happy,
 sad.
 But
 my
 ampl


amplitude,


>> the
 amplitude
 is
 very
 moderated


>> is
 narrower.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 Yeah.
 So,


>> so
 it
 just
 allows
 you
 to
 manage
 in
 many


ways.
 I
 mean,
 success
 is
 somewhat


illusurary.
 If
 you're
 like
 working
 on
 a


problem,
 nobody
 knows
 the
 toil.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Nobody
 really
 wants
 to
 hear
 about
 the


toil.
 They
 want
 to
 have
 a
 very
 simple


way
 of
 pointing
 to
 something
 and
 say,


"Oh,
 wow.
 Look
 at
 what
 you
 have."
 But
 if


you're
 working
 and
 you
 have
 no
 time
 to


enjoy
 it,


>> nobody
 understands
 that,
 you
 know.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 you
 launched
 this
 thing,
 it's


going
 bananas,
 but
 there
 were
 some


hiccups.


>> Yep.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that
 you


got
 too
 addicted
 to
 the
 growth
 at
 any


point?


>> I
 wouldn't
 say
 I
 was
 addicted
 to
 the


growth,
 but
 I
 was
 addicted
 to
 the
 work.


>> Okay.


>> The
 work
 was
 actually
 very
 satisfying,


very
 rewarding.
 But,
 what
 was
 the


average
 day
 for
 you?
 What
 were
 you


trying
 to
 do?
 I
 was
 basically
 doing
 like


20
 plus
 meetings
 a
 day
 like
 scheduled


calls
 or
 meetings
 and
 then
 plus
 other


random
 stuff
 and
 then
 having
 to
 respond


to
 people
 on
 Twitter
 and
 uh
 stuff.
 So
 um


but
 it
 was
 very
 rewarding
 because
 um


it's
 there's
 a
 sense
 of
 fulfillment
 that


is
 very
 hard
 to
 describe.
 It's
 not
 the


money,
 it's
 not
 the
 growth.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 it's
 uh
 you
 know


>> so
 what
 Yeah.
 What
 was
 it
 when
 you
 were


running
 Binance?


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 do
 this,
 but
 some


sometimes
 people
 fixate
 on
 the
 leading


indicator
 like
 revenue
 is
 a
 lagging


indicator,
 right?
 Revenue
 and
 profits


are
 just
 they're
 here.
 That's
 from
 six


months
 ago,
 a
 year
 ago.


>> Yeah.


>> Manifest
 today.
 What
 was
 your
 leading


indicators?
 What
 were
 the
 north
 stars


that
 you
 really
 cared
 about
 that
 said


this
 is
 the
 health
 of
 the
 system?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 daily


active
 users.
 It's
 not
 trading
 volume.


It's
 not
 revenue.
 Why
 DAO
 versus
 those


other
 things?
 I
 think
 as
 long
 as
 you


keep
 helping
 serving
 more
 users
 um
 then


you're
 you
 give
 them
 value.
 So
 I
 believe


a
 product
 is
 valuable
 when
 people
 want


to
 use
 it.


>> So
 the
 more
 people
 who
 wants
 to
 use
 it


even
 if
 your
 revenue
 is
 zero
 you
 have


you
 have
 value.
 So
 any
 product
 that


people
 use
 the
 more
 people
 you
 use
 it


the
 higher
 value
 right?
 So
 that's
 kind


of
 always
 my
 philosophy.
 Whereas


uh
 you
 you
 can
 optimize
 for
 revenue,
 you


can
 optimize
 for
 profit
 shortterm
 and


you
 can
 lose
 the
 long-term
 growth.
 But
 I


believe
 long-term
 if
 you
 have
 a
 large


number
 of
 people
 using
 your
 platform,


that's
 where
 you
 create
 value.
 Not
 just


for
 yourself,
 you
 also
 create
 value
 for


your
 users.
 People
 choose
 to
 use
 you


because
 there's
 a
 value
 in
 using
 you,


right?
 So
 that's
 kind
 of
 my
 my
 my


northstar.
 And


>> also
 knowing
 that
 related
 to
 that
 was


knowing
 that
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of


people
 are
 using
 us,
 we
 help
 them,


right?
 So
 the
 way
 I
 view
 is
 if
 they
 pay


like
 you
 know
 a
 commission
 fee
 that


they're
 willing
 to
 pay
 because
 we
 we
 we


must
 have
 given
 them
 some
 higher
 value.


>> One
 of
 the
 double-edged
 sword
 of
 the
 DAO


>> is
 that
 some
 of
 those
 DAO
 are


bad
 actors.


>> Yep.


>> When
 was
 the
 first
 inkling
 that
 you
 had


that
 that
 may
 be
 a
 problem
 and
 that
 you


have
 to
 take
 that
 seriously?


>> It
 was
 like
 I
 think


>> what
 does
 that
 first
 meeting
 look
 like


where
 they're
 like
 CZ
 I
 have
 good
 news


and
 bad
 news.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 there's
 actually
 a
 very


clear
 point.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 like


Christmas
 day
 January
 1st
 or
 like
 you


know
 New
 Year
 day
 January
 1st
 2018.
 So


this
 is
 like
 six
 five
 months
 after
 you


know
 we
 we
 were
 kind
 of
 large
 uh
 well
 or


five
 months
 after
 we
 started
 and
 we're


kind
 of
 we
 were
 number
 one
 uh
 exchange


already
 on
 that
 New
 Year's
 Eve
 uh


December
 31stish
 uh
 2017
 a
 US
 Homeland


Security
 guy
 reached
 out
 to
 me.
 Um
 his


name
 I
 think
 is
 Joseph.
 Um
 I
 always


remember
 his
 name
 is
 Patrick
 or
 Joseph.


I'm
 not
 sure
 which
 one.


>> Okay.
 um
 he
 wrote
 an
 email
 and
 then
 I


got
 the
 email
 and
 said
 like
 well
 he


wants
 to
 he
 wants
 our
 help
 to
 help
 track


some
 hackers
 who
 may
 have
 moved
 funds
 of


the
 Ether
 Delta
 hack.
 Either
 Delta
 was
 a


decentralized
 exchange
 back
 in
 2017
 that


got
 hacked
 that
 went
 down.
 Um
 so
 this


guy
 who
 works
 for
 the
 US
 government
 uh


emailed
 us
 and
 I
 I
 didn't
 know
 how
 to


deal
 with
 it.
 Nobody
 on
 our
 team
 knows


how
 to
 deal
 with
 law
 enforcement.
 So
 um


I
 you
 know
 got
 a
 couple
 guys
 to
 huddle


up
 together
 say
 how
 how
 do
 we
 help
 this


guy?
 Uh
 and
 then
 we
 gave
 the
 information


that
 he
 requested.
 We
 verified
 who
 first


we
 had
 to
 verify
 who
 he
 was.
 And
 then
 um


uh
 and
 then
 afterwards
 he
 thanked
 us
 uh


and
 then
 I
 said,
 "Hey,
 um
 Joseph,
 can


you
 recommend
 somebody
 that
 we
 could


hire
 that
 can
 interface
 with
 law


enforcement
 in
 the
 future?"
 He


recommended
 someone,
 but
 it
 the
 guy
 was


based
 in
 the
 US
 and
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 US


entity.
 We
 we
 couldn't
 hire
 anybody
 in


the
 US
 back
 then.
 So
 we
 kind
 of
 had
 to


let
 that
 go.
 But
 that
 was
 the
 point.
 It


was
 like
 um
 New
 Year's
 Day.
 Uh
 I


actually
 remember


>> where
 you
 were
 like
 this
 is
 going
 to


happen
 more


>> obviously


>> invariably
 of
 large
 numbers.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 that
 that's
 the
 day
 when


I
 realized
 okay look
 we
 need
 to
 we
 need


we
 need
 to
 have
 somebody
 who
 has


experience
 working
 with
 law
 enforcement


>> and
 so
 what
 did
 you
 do?


>> So
 we
 we
 eventually
 hired
 we
 hired
 more


guys.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.


>> Obviously
 like
 you're
 not
 looking
 at
 the


transactions.
 So
 you
 wouldn't
 know.
 But


if
 we
 fast
 forward
 a
 little
 bit,
 the


claims
 that
 then
 the
 US
 government
 under


President
 Biden
 made
 at
 you


was
 essentially
 that
 people
 like
 Hamas


or
 people
 like
 other
 organizations
 were


using
 Binance
 and
 you
 didn't
 do
 enough.


>> Yeah.
 So
 uh
 on
 this
 point
 I
 may
 have


some
 legal
 restrictions
 on
 what
 I
 can


say
 and
 cannot
 say
 about
 know
 the
 plea


the
 etc.
 So
 I
 I'm
 not
 a
 lawyer
 but
 I'm
 I


try
 to
 stay
 very
 clear
 from
 that.
 But


overall
 though,
 I
 would
 just
 say
 um
 the


Biden
 administration
 overall
 is
 quite


hostile
 to
 crypto.
 I
 mean
 they
 openly


announced
 war
 on
 crypto.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 So


uh
 it's
 good
 to
 see
 this
 new


administration
 change
 180
 degrees.
 I


think
 that's
 this
 is
 good
 for
 America.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 this
 is
 good
 for
 the
 world.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 uh
 I
 think
 it
 was
 I
 wouldn't
 blame


the
 previous
 administration,
 but
 I
 think


they
 just
 didn't
 understand.


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 that
 they
 were
 so


hostile
 to
 it?


>> It's
 fear
 of
 the
 new
 as
 that
 as
 simple


as
 that.
 uh
 I
 think
 they
 probably
 in


their
 heads
 uh
 there's
 some
 degree
 of


let's
 not
 disrupt
 the
 current
 financial


system
 the
 banks
 whoever
 else
 um
 there's


probably
 a
 lot
 of
 lobbying
 from
 those


industries
 as
 well
 to
 them
 so
 that
 kind


of
 brainwash
 or
 affect
 the
 thinking


however
 you
 call
 it


>> so
 that's
 human
 nature
 I
 mean
 if
 you


think
 about
 it
 it's
 understandable
 it's


not
 ideal
 but
 uh
 it's
 understandable


>> so
 you're
 running
 the
 exchange
 things


are
 going
 well
 from
 2018
 2019
 2020


>> it's
 kind
 of
 like
 you're
 really
 coming


into
 your
 own.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> You
 eventually
 opened
 a
 US
 entity.


>> Uh
 yeah,
 in
 2019.
 Yeah.


>> And
 why
 did
 you
 feel
 the
 need
 to
 do


that?


>> So
 2019
 there
 was
 some
 news
 about
 no
 US


governments
 basically
 in
 my
 layman
 words


chasing
 BitMax.
 There
 was
 some
 Big
 Mac


in
 the
 news.
 Uh
 there
 were
 some
 also


Bitfinex
 stuff
 in
 the
 news.
 Uh
 I
 think


the
 US
 government
 frozen
 froze
 at least


the
 Poland
 government
 froze
 like
 six
 to


$800
 million
 of
 their
 assets
 when
 their


market
 cap
 was


>> only
 like
 four
 billion.
 That's
 like
 a


large
 chunk.
 And
 then
 they
 got
 sued


later
 on
 by
 the
 US
 government
 saying


that
 they
 don't
 have
 enough
 reserves.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 we
 saw
 those
 news
 and
 we're
 like
 okay


well
 the
 US
 government
 is
 looking
 at


this
 industry
 and
 we
 better
 register
 and


you
 know
 again
 I
 asked
 my
 friends
 my


many
 of
 them
 have
 legal
 backgrounds
 and


then
 they
 sort
 of
 general
 consensus
 was


okay
 we
 got
 to
 we
 we
 should
 operate
 in
 a


registered
 faction
 in
 the
 US.
 So
 this
 is


2019.
 Um
 so
 we
 registered
 Binance
 US
 and


um
 it's
 a
 separate
 entities.
 It's
 a


separate
 deployment.
 Uh
 it's
 a
 separate


matching
 engine,
 separate
 liquidity.
 So


and
 Binance
 US
 has
 been
 regulated
 from


day
 one.
 Yeah.


>> 2019,
 2020,
 2021
 things
 are
 just


generally
 working.


>> Generally.
 Generally.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Then
 you
 start
 to
 see
 some
 of
 these


other
 folks
 start
 to
 pick
 up
 steam.
 SPF


and
 FTX
 start
 to
 really
 Tell
 me
 about


that.


Um
 uh


>> how
 did
 you
 meet
 him?
 Because
 you
 ended


up
 owning
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 equity.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 well
 we
 we we
 invested
 in


them
 only
 20%
 as
 equity
 at
 some
 point


and
 then
 we
 exited
 a
 year
 a
 year
 later.


Yeah.
 Um
 we
 didn't
 we
 didn't
 stay
 there


for
 very
 long.


>> Uh
 I
 think
 I'm
 first
 met
 him
 in
 January


2019
 in
 one
 of
 the
 Singapore
 conferences


Binance
 organized.


>> I
 think
 at
 the
 time
 FDX
 did
 not
 exist.


uh
 uh
 Sam
 uh
 Bankerman
 Freed
 SBF
 was


running
 um
 Alamea
 and
 they
 hosted
 an


afterparty
 in
 the
 S
 uh
 Singapore
 uh


aquarium
 uh
 on
 Sentosa
 and
 they
 had


divers
 in
 the
 fish
 tank
 you
 know
 holding


a
 sign
 with
 etc.
 So
 they
 were
 they
 were


like
 a
 VIP
 client
 they
 were
 like
 a
 large


trader
 on
 Binance
 so
 we're
 friendly
 to


them.


>> Yeah.
 Right.


>> Yeah.
 So
 that
 was
 in
 January
 2019
 and


then
 a
 couple
 months
 later
 they
 came
 to


us
 saying
 look
 they
 want
 to
 start
 a


futures
 platform.
 They
 proposed
 a


futures
 platform
 uh
 some
 kind
 of
 a
 JV
 uh


that
 I
 I
 can't
 remember
 exactly
 but
 I


think
 they
 proposed
 6040
 in
 our
 favor.


Uh
 we
 we
 want
 I
 thought
 about
 countering


propos
 like
 we
 have
 we
 had
 all
 the
 users


they
 don't
 have
 anything
 back
 then.
 I


thought
 about
 counterproposing
 like
 955


but
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 was
 very
 polite.


They're
 still
 like
 a
 trader.
 They
 still


like
 a
 VIP
 client.


>> So
 we
 declined
 that.
 We
 said
 no.
 Um


>> because
 they
 were
 a
 crucial
 part
 of
 the


liquidity
 pool.


>> Uh
 not
 a
 crucial
 part.
 They're
 a
 large


trader
 but
 you
 know
 Binance
 they
 they


were
 new
 too.
 They
 they
 it
 wasn't
 like


they
 were
 there
 for
 like
 many
 years.


>> Okay.


>> They
 were
 only
 there
 for
 like
 know


probably
 six
 months
 or
 a
 year.
 I
 don't


know
 the
 exact
 uh
 dates.


>> Um
 and
 then
 uh
 uh
 mid
 like
 a
 little
 bit


later
 they
 came
 back
 with
 a
 better


offer.
 Said
 look
 we
 uh
 uh
 like
 in
 summer


they
 came
 back
 with
 a
 better
 offer.
 We


still
 said
 no.
 Um
 and
 then
 in
 in


November
 they
 came
 back
 said
 okay
 look


we're
 going
 to
 offer
 you
 this
 really


really
 attractive
 offer.
 But
 then
 FTX


was
 launched.
 Have
 some
 volume.
 and
 they


said
 look
 we're
 going to
 give
 we're


going
 to
 basically
 give
 you
 20%
 at
 this


at
 this
 price
 and
 there
 was
 a
 swap
 of


tokens
 B&B
 versus
 u
 FT
 tokens
 so
 that's


we
 got
 some
 initial
 uh
 FT
 tokens
 at
 the


time
 B&B
 tokens
 are
 much
 more
 liquid
 and


FT
 tokens
 are
 less
 liquid
 so
 um
 we
 done


that
 deal
 and
 then
 um
 almost
 as
 soon
 as


we
 did
 that
 deal
 I
 keep
 hearing
 from
 my


friends
 like
 you
 know
 SBF
 badmouthing
 us


in
 the
 Washington
 circles
 in
 the
 US
 etc.


I
 was
 like,
 "Come
 on."
 And
 then
 um
 they


also
 did
 some
 other
 stuff
 which
 which
 is


kind
 of
 annoying.
 Uh
 they
 they
 pay
 five


times
 salary
 uh
 of
 to
 our
 VIP
 uh
 uh


account
 managers
 uh
 that
 had
 access
 to


our
 VIP
 database
 and
 then
 so
 that
 girl


goes
 goes
 working
 for
 we
 if
 we
 match


that
 girl
 then
 we
 have
 to
 5x
 everybody.


So
 like
 okay
 you
 you
 go
 work
 for
 them


and
 then


>> the
 day
 after
 the
 girl
 go
 works
 for
 them


our
 VIP
 clients
 gets
 called
 saying
 look


they
 going
 to
 get
 a
 better
 rate
 on
 FTX


etc.
 Like
 so
 I
 called
 Sam
 said
 like
 can


you
 stop
 doing
 this?
 We're
 like
 we're


your
 shareholder
 at
 the
 same
 time
 he's


like
 look
 see
 like
 can
 we
 do
 a
 onetoone


panel
 on
 a
 crypto
 event
 right
 so
 fine


and
 we're
 an
 investor
 we
 want
 we
 want
 to


help
 promote
 it.
 I
 actually
 want


multiple
 exchanges
 to
 be
 to
 be


successful
 in
 the
 industry
 because
 then


we
 wouldn't
 be
 the
 ones
 that
 get


targeted
 all
 the
 time.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 there
 was
 always
 like
 no
 I
 always


keep
 hearing
 there
 was
 some
 bad
 mouthing


some
 other
 this
 and
 that.
 So
 a
 year


later,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 mid
 early
 2021,
 we


said
 uh
 and
 they
 were
 they
 were
 claiming


to
 be
 like
 raising
 money
 at
 you
 know
 32


billion
 valuations.
 We're
 like,
 well,


why
 don't
 we
 exit
 actually?
 So,
 in
 our


investment
 clause,
 we
 had
 veto
 rights
 on


any
 future
 rounds,
 right?
 So,
 if
 you


want
 to
 block
 them,
 we
 could.
 I
 didn't


want
 to
 use
 that
 to
 block
 them.
 Uh


>> oh,
 wow.


>> So,
 I
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 even
 if
 why


don't
 we
 just
 exit
 and
 we
 can
 compete,


>> right?
 So
 um
 and
 then
 we
 thought
 we
 we


talked
 about
 exit
 and
 then
 we
 exited
 I


think
 in
 if
 I
 remember
 correctly
 it
 was


in
 July
 the
 deal
 was
 finalized
 and
 the


transfer
 was
 done
 in
 July
 2021
 and
 this


is
 like
 a
 full
 a
 full
 year
 and
 a
 half


before
 they
 had
 issues
 at
 the
 time
 we


didn't
 know


>> right
 because
 there
 was
 some
 rumors
 that


a
 lot
 of
 their
 issues
 started
 after
 you


sold
 and
 they
 were
 somehow
 conjoined.


I'm
 sure
 you've
 heard
 of
 that
 but
 you


can
 put
 all
 of
 that
 to
 bed.


>> Yeah.
 So
 that's
 categorically
 not
 true.


And
 also
 because
 of
 the
 competitive


nature
 in
 the
 businesses,
 even
 though


we're
 a
 shareholder,
 I
 never
 really
 I


never
 ask
 them
 for
 for
 financial


statements.


>> Oh
 wow.


>> So
 I
 just,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 didn't
 ask


for
 it.
 I'm
 a
 very
 passive
 investor.
 So


when
 I
 invest,
 I
 don't
 get
 involved
 in


their
 business.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 they
 also
 they're
 slightly


competitive.
 We
 have
 we
 had
 a
 futures


platform.
 They
 had
 they
 have
 a
 futures


platform.
 So
 I
 try
 to
 stay
 no
 let
 them


do
 their
 thing.


>> So
 post
 this
 the
 thing
 with
 the
 FTX


thing
 that
 most
 people
 talk
 about
 are
 a


couple
 things.
 One
 was
 the
 way
 in
 which


the
 restitution
 happened
 was
 suboptimal


to
 some
 of
 the
 holders
 of
 of
 FTX
 people


who
 had
 cash
 money
 there.
 The
 other


thing
 that
 people
 talk
 about
 is
 the


value
 of
 some
 of
 these
 investments
 post.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 in
 the
 aftermath
 of


all
 of
 this?
 It
 says
 anything
 at
 all


about
 the
 industry
 or


>> um
 I
 don't
 crypto
 in
 general
 or
 Yeah.
 I


don't
 understand
 the
 whole
 uh
 bankruptcy


process
 whether
 that's
 fair
 or
 not.
 Um
 I


read
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 things
 online.


Also
 um
 just
 to
 be
 transparent,
 there's


an
 ongoing
 lawsuit
 between
 the
 state
 and


us.
 they
 want
 to
 try
 to
 claw
 back
 some


of
 the
 money
 that
 we
 got
 like
 a
 year
 and


a
 half
 before,


>> right?


>> So
 there's
 probably
 limited
 stuff
 I
 can


comment
 on
 that.


>> Um,
 yeah,
 but
 again,
 I'm
 not
 an
 expert


there,
 but
 I
 did
 hear
 some
 complaints


about,
 you
 know,
 some
 Chinese
 users
 not


allegible,
 etc.,
 etc.,
 but
 now
 from
 what


I
 read
 is
 the
 the
 because
 of
 their


appreciation
 of
 crypto
 now
 in
 US
 dollar


terms,
 uh,
 they
 have
 enough
 uh,
 right?


>> Even
 though
 if
 people
 held
 crypto
 back


then,
 they
 probably
 have
 gotten
 more.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 the
 deal
 is.
 When
 did


things
 at
 Binance


start
 to
 get
 complicated
 for
 you?


>> You
 mean
 with
 the
 US
 governments,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> For
 me
 like
 uh
 they
 started
 asking
 for


information
 the
 information
 requests


which
 we
 always
 comply,
 right?
 So
 that


was
 like
 2021
 2022ish


and
 it
 was
 like
 uh
 late
 2022
 it
 was


getting
 more
 hostile.
 Um,
 and
 then
 I


think
 in
 early
 2023
 was
 more
 clear
 that


they
 were
 making
 uh
 they
 were
 uh
 we


either
 reach
 a
 deal
 of
 some
 kind
 or


they're
 going
 to
 indict
 us
 or
 stuff
 like


that.
 There
 was
 like
 it
 became


negotiations.
 How
 do
 you
 deal
 with
 that


as
 a
 person?
 Do
 you
 think
 I
 can't


believe
 this
 is
 happening?
 Like
 when


you're
 in
 this
 meeting
 and
 your
 lawyers


or
 whoever
 it
 is
 are
 telling
 you,
 hey


CZ,
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 an


indictment.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 don't
 How
 does
 that
 meeting
 go?


>> So,
 uh,
 number
 one,
 I'm
 not
 a
 legal


background,
 so
 I
 had
 to
 rely
 on
 a
 lot
 of


other
 people's
 advice.
 That's
 generally


the
 harder
 part
 for
 me
 because
 I
 don't


have
 experience
 there
 like
 no
 no
 one
 has


experience
 going
 through
 this.
 You
 go


through
 this
 once
 you
 never
 want
 to


touch
 it
 again.
 Right.
 So
 um
 so
 no
 one


really
 on
 on
 the
 receiving
 end
 have
 any


experience.
 Um
 you
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


lawyers
 and
 the
 lawyers
 are
 the
 lawyers


I
 think
 are
 good
 but
 how
 you
 organize


lawyers
 actually
 is
 quite
 tricky.
 If
 we


hire
 a
 bunch
 of
 expensive
 lawyers,
 they


all
 have
 different
 specialties
 and
 they


all
 have
 different
 opinions


>> and
 they
 all
 want
 to
 seem
 like
 the


smartest
 person
 that's
 driving
 the


decision


>> and
 also
 they
 they
 all
 want
 to
 take
 a


lot
 of
 time
 to
 analyze.
 They
 get
 paid
 by


more
 time
 they
 spend.
 Um
 I'm
 not
 saying


that
 they're
 unethical.
 They
 they
 want


to
 do
 a
 really
 good
 job.


>> Um
 but
 then
 they
 go
 in
 all
 kind
 of


different
 tangents.
 Um
 so
 you
 get


dragged
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 different


places.
 That
 was
 the
 most
 troublesome


part
 for
 me.
 If
 somebody
 told
 me
 like


this
 are
 the
 three
 things
 you
 got
 to


focus
 on
 this
 is
 you
 know
 you
 got
 to


this
 strategy.
 We
 also
 didn't
 have
 a


strong
 legal
 team.
 Uh
 our
 team
 is
 young.


Uh
 we
 we
 our
 our
 legal
 team
 didn't
 have


this
 type
 of
 experience
 dealing
 dealing


with
 this
 type
 of
 uh
 uh
 uh
 issues.
 So


that
 was
 always
 tricky.
 But
 I
 kind
 of


look
 at
 when
 I
 come
 by
 the
 way
 where
 was


the
 entire
 team
 at
 this
 point
 still


>> this
 we're
 all
 spread
 out


>> now.
 You're
 everywhere.


>> We're
 now
 we're
 everywhere.
 We're
 spread


out.
 And
 I
 think
 I
 2023
 I
 was
 in
 Dubai.


Uh
 I
 was
 in
 Abu
 Dhabi
 Dubai
 split
 in


time.
 So
 um
 yeah
 it
 it
 was
 very


stressful
 um
 but
 the
 way
 I
 deal
 with


stress
 is
 I
 just
 look
 at
 the
 best
 and


worst
 case
 scenarios
 right
 so
 um
 say


asked
 team
 what's
 the
 best
 case
 scenario


okay
 you
 pay
 a
 fine
 you
 get
 a
 you
 know


you
 get
 a
 DPA
 or
 then
 this
 this
 thing's


over
 then
 okay
 so
 that's
 the
 best
 case


and
 then
 the
 worst
 case
 okay
 so
 they


were
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 to
 they're
 going


to
 try
 to
 put
 you
 in
 jail
 um
 stuff
 like


that


>> was
 that
 the
 worst
 case
 though
 because


at
 the
 time
 it
 seemed
 like
 the
 fact


pattern
 was
 folks
 would
 get
 some
 sort
 of


probation
 or


>> that
 would
 be
 the
 worst
 worst
 case
 but


also
 uh
 yeah
 so
 performing
 nobody
 got


put
 in
 jail
 but
 they
 they
 could
 ask
 for


it.


>> Yeah.
 Right.
 Right.
 Right.
 There's


actually
 another
 worst
 case
 which
 is
 you


fight
 it
 and
 then
 you
 if
 you
 if
 you
 come


if
 you
 can't
 agree
 on
 a
 term
 you
 fight


it
 and
 you
 stay
 in
 the
 UAE
 which
 is
 a


non-extradition
 country
 and
 you
 know
 and


now
 you
 have
 citizenship
 and
 so
 they


there's
 almost
 zero
 chance
 you'll
 get


extradited
 but
 then
 your
 travel
 is
 going


to
 be
 limited
 anytime
 if
 if
 you
 cross
 to


a
 different
 country
 even
 if
 that
 country


is
 a
 non-extragene
 country
 that
 can


still
 be
 a
 chance
 that
 there's
 a
 deal


being
 made
 right
 it's
 kind
 of
 leaving


fear
 so


>> plus
 it
 also
 creates
 complexity
 just
 at


governmentto
 government
 level
 if
 folks


are
 allies
 and
 it
 just
 it
 just
 creates
 a


lot
 of
 noise


>> it
 creates
 a
 lot
 of
 noise
 it
 also


creates
 a
 lot
 of
 pressure
 for
 the
 UAE


government
 potentially
 I
 don't
 want
 to


trouble
 people
 who
 gave
 me
 a
 citizenship


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 trouble
 causer


>> right


>> right
 so
 um
 and
 uh
 so
 but
 you
 know
 there


are
 the
 the
 worst
 case
 scenario
 is
 like


you
 know
 you
 don't
 go
 there
 they
 indict


you
 and
 then
 you
 they
 put
 you
 on
 the
 red


notice
 list


>> um
 stuff
 like
 that
 right
 so
 that
 those


you
 know
 those
 those
 are
 potential


possibilities
 yeah
 so
 how
 did
 you


resolve
 It
 took
 like
 the
 negotiations


like
 was
 basically
 daily
 calls
 with
 with


like
 12
 20
 lawyers
 on
 call
 for
 like
 more


than
 a
 year.


>> Uh
 more
 than
 a
 year
 more
 than
 a
 year


>> of
 back
 and
 forth
 with
 the
 president


Biden
 DOJ


>> the
 president
 Biden
 DOJ
 and
 and
 the
 most


common
 thing
 I
 hear
 from
 my
 lawyers
 is


we
 have
 never
 seen
 them
 this
 hostile
 on


a
 case
 like
 this.


>> Right.
 We
 have
 never
 seen
 this
 before.


This
 is
 this
 like
 that's
 the
 most
 common


phrase
 my
 I've
 heard.
 At
 some
 point
 you


just
 become
 desensitized
 to
 it
 or
 do
 you


keep
 internalizing
 it,
 personalizing
 it?


You
 think
 why
 is
 this
 happening
 to
 me?


No
 resentment
 or
 just
 more
 how
 did
 you


deal
 with
 it?
 I'm
 just


>> It
 takes
 it
 takes
 successive
 steps
 and


there
 were
 a
 couple
 steps
 which
 are


really
 hard
 to
 take.
 Um
 the
 step
 where


you
 say
 look
 in
 the
 negotiations
 right


they
 come
 to
 a
 few
 points
 where
 you
 say


look
 we
 just
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 have
 to


say
 no.
 Um
 and
 it's
 like
 look
 we
 just


can't
 agree
 to
 that
 deal.
 They
 wouldn't


back
 off
 and
 I
 couldn't
 agree
 to
 that


deal.
 We
 just
 have
 to
 say
 no.
 And
 then


there
 was
 a
 couple
 weeks
 that
 lapse
 and


you
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to
 happen.


So
 you


>> purgatory.
 So
 you
 could
 get
 indicted
 in


they
 can
 indict
 you
 any
 moment,
 right?


So
 that's
 their
 choice.
 You
 you
 you


already
 said
 no
 to
 that
 to
 that.
 There


were
 like
 a
 couple
 periods
 of
 like
 that


and
 then
 oh
 my
 god
 in
 those
 in
 those


couple
 weeks
 you're
 like
 you're
 mentally


thinking
 okay


>> I
 can't
 travel
 anywhere.
 Um
 so
 I
 I
 might


have
 to
 get
 used
 to
 this
 life
 of
 just


living
 in
 one
 country
 and
 be
 very


careful
 etc.
 there
 might
 be
 some
 sealed


indictment
 that
 that's
 not
 public
 the
 at


any
 border
 that
 you
 cross
 and
 u


interestingly
 they
 come
 back
 after
 two


weeks
 and
 they
 say
 okay
 we
 can
 negotiate


again
 and
 then
 you're
 like
 what
 do
 you


think
 is
 happening
 over
 there


>> well
 no
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 now
 looking


back
 that's
 a
 very
 that's
 a
 very
 useful


negotiation
 tactic
 for
 me
 or
 for
 anybody


in
 my
 situation
 for


>> the
 silence


>> uh
 yeah
 the
 silence
 for
 anybody
 who's


going
 through
 this
 on
 the
 receiving
 end


you
 only
 go
 through
 this
 once
 you're
 not


experienced
 this
 is
 your
 life
 I
 mean


there
 could
 be
 a
 red
 sealed
 red
 notice


against
 you
 um
 and
 this
 is
 the
 life
 they


have
 to
 deal
 with
 going
 forever
 and
 they


don't
 like
 this
 thing
 these
 things
 can


stay
 there
 for
 like
 decades
 for
 them


they
 do
 this
 every
 day
 this
 is
 like
 this


is
 their
 daily
 job
 right
 so
 and
 but
 they


I
 think
 they're
 smart
 enough
 that
 they


know
 two
 weeks
 is
 about
 the
 optimum
 time


because
 longer
 than
 that
 you
 really
 get


used
 to
 it
 and
 when
 they
 come
 back
 to


negotiate
 you're
 going
 to
 say
 no
 right


it's
 like
 look
 I'm
 already
 used
 to
 this


>> right
 so
 like
 if
 you
 leave
 the
 guy
 in


the
 situation
 for
 too
 long


>> interesting
 interesting


>> so so
 they're
 very
 skilled
 in
 this
 type


of
 uh
 mental
 uh
 uh
 uh
 work,


>> right?
 Whereas
 Yeah.
 So,
 there
 were
 some


really
 tough
 periods
 and
 for
 this
 type


of
 stuff,
 you
 don't
 get
 used
 to
 it.
 Um


you
 it's
 it's
 mentally
 challenging.
 How


did
 you
 get
 yourself
 to
 a
 place
 to
 agree


to
 the
 final
 terms?


>> After
 a
 lot
 of
 negotiations,
 we're
 like,


okay,
 um
 basically
 said,
 okay,
 I


validated
 a
 single
 uh
 single
 charge
 of
 a


banking
 secrecy
 violation,
 which
 is
 a


registration
 failure,
 which
 is
 a
 federal


crime.
 It's
 it's
 serious.
 Uh
 but
 no
 one


went
 to
 jail
 for
 this
 in
 history.
 Um
 and


um
 there's
 no
 there's
 no
 uh


>> sorry
 that
 charge
 that's
 more
 technical.


How
 does
 that
 relate
 to
 the
 perception


of
 what
 was
 in
 the
 media
 at least
 in


America
 which
 is
 money
 laundering
 and


aiding
 at
 abetting
 folks
 and
 not
 doing


KYC
 and
 not
 doing
 AML
 versus
 the
 actual


charge.
 Are
 those
 two
 things
 connected


and
 they're
 equal
 or
 these
 are
 sort
 of


disjoint


>> perception
 versus
 the
 actual
 specifics?


>> Sure.
 I
 can
 try
 to
 explain
 my


understanding.
 I'm
 not
 a
 lawyer.
 So
 I


want
 to
 make
 a
 small
 disclaimer
 here.
 Um


this
 is
 my
 layman
 understanding
 could
 be


wrong.


>> Uh
 there's
 a
 first
 my
 understanding


there's
 a
 first
 level
 is
 like
 banking


secrecy
 act
 violation
 which
 is
 a
 failure


to
 register.
 Basically
 you
 serviced
 we


service
 US
 users
 without
 register
 as
 a


financial
 services
 company
 in
 the
 US.


>> So
 that's
 a
 you
 thing
 that
 has
 nothing


to
 do
 with
 the
 user
 themselves
 doing


anything
 nefarious
 or
 bad.


>> No,
 you
 did
 not
 register
 with
 the
 proper


authorities
 to
 say
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 on


US
 customs.


>> And
 so
 that's
 number
 one,
 right?
 So
 that


that
 that's
 the
 bait
 that's
 the
 kind
 of


bait
 layer.
 Okay.
 On
 top
 of
 that
 you
 can


say
 look
 you
 didn't
 have
 adequate
 KYC


AML
 procedures.
 So
 your
 all
 your


procedures
 are
 not
 strong
 enough.
 Um
 so


uh
 uh
 so
 that's
 another
 that's
 another


level
 which
 even
 even
 if
 you're
 not


registered
 you're
 also
 supposed
 to
 have


good
 KYC
 etc.
 AML
 procedures.
 Um
 and


those
 things
 are
 not
 and
 those
 things


people
 think
 that's
 a
 black
 and
 white


thing.
 In
 reality
 it's
 not.
 Uh
 it's
 how


well
 you
 do
 it.
 Uh
 which
 systems
 do
 you


use?
 what
 how
 do
 you
 do
 this?


>> How
 many
 people
 do
 you
 have?
 What's
 your


standard
 operating
 procedures?
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 actually
 a
 lot
 of


details
 and
 then
 like
 uh
 quite
 a
 bit


above
 that
 in
 my
 understanding
 is
 if
 you


have
 somehow
 known
 and
 facilitated
 uh


bad
 transactions.
 So
 you
 can
 have
 a
 weak


AL
 pro
 AML
 program
 and
 that
 didn't
 catch


all
 the
 bad
 players
 but
 you
 you
 don't


know
 that.


>> Right.
 So
 it's
 not
 like
 you're


intentionally
 facilitating
 that.


>> It's
 not
 robust.


>> It's
 not
 robust.


>> It's
 relatively
 naive
 but
 it's
 there.


>> Yeah.
 versus
 this
 is
 I
 know
 this
 to
 be


bad
 and
 I'm
 enabling
 it
 to
 happen


regardless.


>> Yeah.
 Right.


>> And
 there's
 the
 next
 level
 which
 you


personally
 handling
 the
 transactions.


>> Right.


>> Right.
 So
 which
 is
 you
 know
 uh
 you
 know


Charlie
 Charlie
 Shramm
 handled
 uh


transactions
 for
 Silk
 Road
 for
 for
 Ross.


Right.
 So
 that's
 how
 you
 know
 so
 there's


different
 levels.
 I
 don't
 handle
 any


transactions
 at
 all
 my
 myself.
 That's


just
 not
 my
 thing.
 I
 just
 don't
 do
 it.


And
 so
 they
 said
 okay
 Binance
 number
 one


we
 didn't
 register
 KYC
 ML
 is
 weak.
 Uh
 so


that
 those
 are
 things
 we
 can
 fine
 we
 can


agree
 on
 that


>> layer
 one
 layer
 two.


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 can
 agree
 on
 that
 for
 those


single
 charges
 without
 any
 other


additional
 stuff.
 No
 one
 ever
 went
 to


jail
 in
 US
 history
 even
 till
 today.


Right.
 So
 u
 uh
 and
 then
 the
 government


uh
 we
 couldn't
 agree
 on
 the
 two
 addition


the
 government
 want
 to
 add
 two


additional
 charges
 they
 call


enhancements
 the
 three
 and
 four.
 The


three
 and
 four
 they
 said
 somehow
 I


personally
 facilitated
 but
 they
 couldn't


provide
 any
 evidence.
 They
 were
 trying


to
 lean
 on
 the
 company
 somehow
 something


happened
 in
 the
 company
 you
 know
 etc.


they
 were
 trying
 to
 use.
 Were
 they
 able


to
 point
 to
 a
 transaction
 or
 some


>> No,
 they
 wasn't.
 So
 this
 two


enhancements
 the
 court
 outright
 rejected


but
 we
 decided
 to
 we
 before
 I
 went
 to


the
 US
 we
 said
 we
 agreed
 that
 we
 will


argue
 that
 in
 court
 right
 um
 and
 also


based
 on
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 into
 the


sort
 of
 privileged
 conversations
 but


like
 the
 understanding
 I
 went
 before
 I


went
 was
 no
 one
 went
 to
 jail
 the
 worst


uh
 guy
 who
 got
 punished
 was
 author
 Hayes


of
 Bitmax
 he
 got
 six
 months
 of
 home


confinement
 uh
 for
 run
 for
 for
 Bitmax


and
 uh
 when
 I
 look
 at
 that
 case
 he
 had


much
 more
 direct
 interactions
 with


clients


whereas
 I
 had
 much
 less
 direction.
 I


basically
 I
 don't
 deal
 with
 clients
 at


Binance.
 I
 deal
 with
 users
 on
 Twitter


but
 not
 like
 you
 know
 the
 Bance
 back
 end


kind
 of
 thing.


>> So
 I
 felt
 pretty
 confident
 that
 you
 know


we
 should
 be
 in
 a
 fairly
 strong
 position


and
 that's
 the
 best
 thing
 forward.


>> Right.
 So
 you're
 like
 we
 agree
 with


this.
 We
 agree
 with
 this.
 We're
 going
 to


really
 debate
 this
 in
 court.
 Layers


three
 and
 four.
 I'm
 going
 to
 come
 to
 the


US.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 we're
 going
 to
 hash
 it
 out
 in
 court.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 you
 land
 in
 America.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 go
 into
 the
 courtroom.
 you
 start


this
 process,
 what
 happens?


>> So
 yeah,
 there
 was
 quite
 a
 lot
 of


details
 there.
 Uh


first
 of
 all,
 the
 first
 like
 the
 first


day
 you
 go
 you
 go
 and
 plea,
 right?
 So


the
 plea
 the
 agreement
 has
 already
 like


debated


>> by
 the
 way.
 Sorry.
 And
 where
 you're


staying
 in
 a
 hotel?


>> I
 was
 staying
 in
 a
 hotel.
 Yeah,
 I
 was


staying
 in
 a
 hotel
 in
 downtown
 Seattle.


Um


>> is
 your
 family
 with
 you
 or
 No,


>> my
 family
 went
 to
 join
 to
 to
 Well,
 not


my
 not
 my
 not
 my
 not
 my
 kids.
 Um
 but
 my


sister
 and
 my
 mom
 went
 to
 join
 me.
 Um
 I


didn't
 want
 my
 kids
 to
 go
 um
 they
 have


school
 and
 and
 then
 my
 partner
 has
 a


business
 to
 run.
 Um
 I
 was
 already
 like


no
 no
 longer
 running
 the
 business.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 drag
 her
 away
 from


from from
 from
 that.


>> So
 um


>> yeah
 so
 my
 sister
 my
 my
 my
 my
 mom
 and
 my


older
 kids
 with
 with
 me


>> and
 then
 um
 uh
 yeah
 so
 that's
 and
 then
 I


was
 stay
 in
 a
 hotel
 um
 and
 then
 the
 next


morning
 go
 going
 to
 court.
 Going
 to


court
 the
 first
 part
 of
 the
 process
 is


the
 plea
 right.
 The
 judge
 asks
 you,
 "Do


you
 understand
 this
 paragraph,
 this


paragraph,
 this
 paragraph?"
 Just
 say,


"Yes,
 yes,
 yes."
 the
 the
 paragraphs
 were


already
 like
 negotiated
 like
 out
 of
 the


wazoo
 by
 the
 multiple
 so
 many
 lawyers


>> over
 lawyered


>> over
 lawyered
 and
 you
 the
 um
 so
 so
 you


know
 and
 then
 you
 then
 the
 lawyers


debate
 about
 you
 know
 the
 the
 uh
 they


didn't
 the
 first
 case
 when
 I
 after
 the


plea
 they
 didn't
 debate
 about
 the
 charge


they
 debate
 about
 my
 bail
 my
 bail


condition
 right
 so
 I
 got
 a
 post
 bail
 u


my
 lawyers
 argued
 I
 should
 be
 allowed
 to


go
 back
 to
 UAE
 waiting
 for
 the
 sentence


three
 months
 Later
 the
 government
 argued


that
 um
 uh
 I
 may
 not
 come
 back.
 So
 they


want
 me
 to
 stay
 in
 the
 US
 and
 they
 said


they
 will
 not
 restrict
 me
 in
 my
 movement


in
 the
 US
 because
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 I
 I
 don't
 possess
 any
 harm
 to
 the


community.
 They
 argue
 about
 that
 the
 the


the
 magistrate
 judge
 the
 first
 judge


approved
 me
 leaving
 the
 US
 to
 go
 back
 to


the
 UAE
 for
 3
 months
 which
 would
 which


would
 have
 been
 great.
 And
 then
 the
 the


the
 government
 appealed
 that
 uh
 my


lawyer
 says
 like
 in
 his
 40
 years
 he


never
 seen
 a
 appeal
 on
 a
 bail
 condition.


>> Wow.


>> And
 then
 he
 said
 well
 this
 guy
 is
 a
 ton


death
 uh
 because
 they
 will
 this
 will


piss
 off
 the
 courts
 which
 will
 actually


be
 my
 favor.
 And
 guess
 what
 two
 weeks


later
 the
 court
 ruled
 ruding
 in
 the


government's
 favor
 and
 I
 was
 kept
 in
 the


US.
 So
 I
 was
 kept
 away
 from
 home
 uh
 for


three
 months.
 When
 three
 months
 came


>> that
 hotel


>> I
 was
 free
 to
 travel
 in
 the
 US.
 I
 was


like
 well
 I'm
 stuck
 in
 the
 US
 so
 might


as
 well
 travel.
 Uh
 I
 had
 a
 sister
 my


sister
 have
 a
 place
 in
 the
 US.
 So
 I
 was


staying
 with
 my
 sister
 for
 a
 bit
 of
 the


time
 and
 then
 I
 was
 traveling
 um
 just


cool
 just
 to
 try
 to
 keep
 myself
 cool.


Chill.
 All right.
 Um
 and
 then
 3
 months


later
 the
 government
 requests
 for


another
 3
 months
 extension.
 So
 now
 I


have
 to
 stay
 in
 the
 US
 for
 another
 3


months
 longer
 waiting
 for


>> Now
 were
 your
 kids
 at
 this
 point
 coming


to
 see
 you
 at
 least
 so
 that
 they
 could


come
 see
 you
 or


>> No,
 I
 I
 did
 not
 ask
 them
 to
 come
 and
 see


me.
 Um


>> so
 you
 didn't
 see
 them
 for
 six
 months?


>> Uh
 yeah
 and
 well
 actually
 I
 didn't
 see


them
 for
 that
 year.
 Yeah.
 For
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 uh
 and
 then
 so
 the
 government


asked
 for
 another
 3
 months
 extension


then
 on
 April
 30th
 2024
 uh
 that's
 my


core
 date
 and
 then
 a
 week
 before
 that
 is


when
 both
 sides
 submit
 their
 their


request
 the
 government
 request
 for
 36


months
 which
 is
 twice
 the
 maximum


sentencing
 guideline
 for
 the
 worst
 case


scenario
 for
 me.
 Right.
 So
 the
 court


said
 like
 then
 this
 court
 had
 never
 seen


a
 government
 asking
 the
 court
 to
 ignore


the
 sentencing
 guideline.
 Did
 you
 find


that
 out
 for
 the
 first
 time
 sitting


there
 in
 the
 court?


>> No,
 just
 a
 week
 before
 the
 court
 because


the
 government
 had
 to
 make
 the
 subm


submission.
 There's
 a
 written
 submission


before.


>> How
 did
 you
 react
 to
 that?


>> Well,
 not
 good.
 Right.
 So,
 uh
 and
 then


my
 lawyers
 also
 the
 my
 lawyer
 told


changed
 before
 they
 said,
 "Oh,
 you
 can


probably
 get
 home."
 They
 said,
 "Look,


the
 judge
 most
 likely
 is
 going
 to
 split


the
 baby."
 So,
 if
 the
 government's


asking
 for
 36
 months,
 you're
 asking
 for


probation.
 The
 the
 government
 most


likely
 to
 pick
 some
 number
 in
 between,


right?
 So
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 that's
 not


good."


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.
 And
 also
 5
 days
 before
 my


sentencing,
 um
 on
 April
 25th,


Senator
 Elizabeth
 Warren
 went
 on
 TV
 to


say
 to
 declare
 war
 on
 crypto
 again.
 Um


so
 this
 is
 like
 5
 days
 before
 my


sentencing.
 Um
 and
 he
 wrote
 an
 open


letter.
 She
 wrote
 an
 open
 letter
 to
 the


DOJ
 saying
 all
 this
 stuff.
 Um
 which
 is


actually
 most
 of
 it
 is
 is is
 not


correct.


So
 uh
 yeah.
 So
 then
 that's
 and
 April


30th
 I
 got
 sentenced
 and
 then
 the
 judge


the
 judge
 said
 a
 bunch
 of
 good
 really


good
 things
 about
 me.
 Uh
 I
 have
 all
 the


excerpts
 in
 the
 book
 but
 then
 at
 some


point
 the
 judge
 says
 but
 and
 then
 you


like
 okay
 that's
 not
 good.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 I
 got
 forward


>> that's
 how
 they
 start
 the
 sentencing.


They're
 like
 he's
 telling
 you
 all
 the


good
 things
 and
 then
 he
 gets
 to
 the
 butt


and
 you're
 like
 oh
 my
 god.


>> Pretty
 much.
 Pretty
 much.
 Yeah.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.
 So
 uh
 the
 the
 lawyer
 still
 debate


the
 sentencing
 on
 the
 April
 3rd
 is
 the


lawyers
 debating
 court
 about
 no
 this
 ar


that's
 when
 the
 two
 hazmats
 got
 rejected


u
 by
 the
 court
 like
 my
 lawyers
 argue


like
 no
 this
 and
 that
 uh
 this
 I
 never


touched
 any
 of
 transactions
 I'm
 not


aware
 this
 things
 just


>> layers
 three
 and
 four
 of
 the
 accusations


got
 thrown
 out.


>> Yeah.
 So
 um
 and
 then
 uh
 they
 argue
 about


you
 know
 what's
 what
 what
 should
 what


should
 what
 the
 recommended
 uh


sentencing
 should
 be.
 My
 lawyers
 of


course
 argued
 for
 either
 uh
 home
 uh


probation
 uh
 or
 home
 confinement
 at
 the


worst
 case,
 right?
 Um
 and
 then
 the


government
 argued
 like
 this
 guy's
 really


bad
 guy,
 you
 know,
 this
 case
 is
 really


big.
 Um
 and
 we
 should
 punish
 him
 really


really
 hard
 with
 double
 the
 punishment


of
 any
 legally
 recommended
 punishment.


Uh
 36
 months.
 Um
 so
 the
 judge
 landed
 at


four.


>> How
 did
 you
 deal
 with
 that?


>> It
 was
 difficult
 at
 at
 the
 beginning,


right?
 Um
 it
 wasn't
 a
 full
 month.
 It
 was


am
 I
 going
 to
 be
 safe?


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 So
 if
 if
 if
 like
 if
 you
 tell
 me


like
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 to
 this
 place
 for
 4


months.
 Am
 I
 I'm
 guaranteed
 to
 be
 safe?


I'll
 be
 okay.
 I
 be
 like,
 "Okay,
 fine.
 I


I
 just
 deal
 with
 it."
 But
 the
 uncertain


part
 is
 like
 uh
 also
 right
 after
 the


sentencing,
 uh
 um
 a
 bunch
 of
 the
 big


media
 wrote
 that
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 the


richest
 person
 to
 ever
 go
 to
 US
 prison.


Uh
 and
 or
 and
 then
 my
 lawyers
 plus


prison
 consultants
 they
 say
 well
 given


all
 the
 all
 this
 coverage


>> what
 is
 a
 prison
 consultant


>> that's
 a
 whole
 industry
 of
 some
 guy
 who


advise
 you
 what
 prison
 is
 like
 and
 give


you
 advice
 and
 stuff
 like
 that
 how
 to


live
 how
 to
 yeah
 so
 that's
 a
 whole
 big


industry
 that's
 growing
 because
 of
 the


prison
 population
 is
 growing
 in
 the
 US


so
 anyway
 so
 the
 prison
 consultants
 like


given
 the
 highprofile
 coverage
 you
 are
 a


prime
 you're
 the
 probably
 the
 biggest


target
 for
 potential
 extortion


in
 in
 in
 prison.
 So
 your
 safety
 is
 going


to
 be
 a
 issue.
 So
 that's
 the
 thing
 I
 was


worried
 about
 then.
 I
 was
 like
 uh
 so
 how


how
 do
 I
 deal
 like
 you
 know
 you
 go
 in


and
 they
 you
 don't
 have
 anything,
 right?


Um
 how
 how
 do
 you
 how
 do
 I
 make
 sure


that
 I
 stay
 safe?
 Um
 uh
 that's
 like
 the


the
 top
 consideration,
 right?
 So
 you


you're
 really
 thinking
 about
 how
 do
 you


do
 that?
 So
 well
 you
 know
 um
 you
 talk
 to


a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 prison
 consultants


are
 usually
 like
 um
 exgards
 ex
 wardens.


There's
 another
 group
 of
 guys
 who
 people


who
 have
 been
 to
 but
 those
 guys
 are
 in


prison
 but
 they
 working
 there.
 They're


not
 they're
 not
 inmates.
 There's
 another


group
 of
 guys
 who've
 been
 into
 prison


prison
 like
 know
 they
 they
 were
 there


for
 like
 as
 a
 inmate.
 So
 you
 talk
 to
 a


lot
 of
 those
 guys.
 Um
 and
 then
 uh
 you


figure
 out
 what
 prison
 is
 like.
 Do
 you


make
 friends?
 Do
 you
 not
 make
 friends?


you
 get
 advice
 on
 like
 know
 if
 somebody


comes
 up
 on
 to
 you
 on
 the
 first
 day
 and


they're
 really
 really
 friendly
 don't


take
 anything
 from
 them
 because
 know


they
 will
 ask
 for
 10
 times
 more
 favor


back
 later
 on
 if
 you
 don't
 then
 they


stab
 you
 and
 stuff
 like
 that
 so
 um
 I
 got


a
 lot
 of
 different
 advice
 but
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 you
 just
 got
 to
 go
 and
 face


it
 right
 so
 um
 um
 I
 learned
 what
 I


learned
 is
 actually
 the
 US
 prison
 system


so
 vast
 2
 million
 people
 stay
 in
 US


prison
 the
 US
 government
 spends
 perm


more
 on
 prison
 than
 the
 on
 education
 on


schools
 right
 so
 That's
 know
 how
 much
 uh


how
 big
 the
 US
 prison
 population
 is.
 And


uh
 because
 and
 there's
 50
 states
 and


everyone
 every
 state
 has
 a
 different


system.
 Uh
 the
 state
 prisons,
 there's


federal
 prisons
 and
 each
 one
 is
 like
 a


mini
 city.
 They
 each
 like
 the
 prison
 I


went
 in
 has
 um
 has
 2200
 inmates.
 It's


like
 a
 small
 city.
 Um
 and
 they
 each
 have


their
 own
 rules,
 etc.
 So
 I
 got
 some


advice
 um
 but
 many
 of
 those
 advice
 are


not
 really
 useful.
 But
 when
 you
 go
 in,


you
 just
 got
 to
 deal
 with
 it.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 you
 get
 sentenced
 on
 April
 30th,
 you


said.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 when
 do
 you
 start?


>> So,
 when
 you
 get
 sentenced,
 you
 don't


know
 where
 we
 don't
 know
 which
 prison


you're
 going
 to.
 The
 court
 makes
 two


recommendations.
 Um,
 and
 then
 um
 uh


usually
 you
 will
 receive
 a
 letter
 in


>> but
 you're
 you
 can
 be
 in
 the
 hotel
 or


doing
 whatever
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to


check
 in
 basically
 on
 some
 date
 like
 you


have
 to
 go.
 So,
 in
 my
 case,
 the
 judge


ruled
 that
 I
 don't
 need
 supervision


which
 is
 very
 unique.
 Um
 then
 I
 don't


have
 to
 check
 in.
 So
 I
 just
 have
 to
 sit


uh
 I
 just
 have
 to
 wait
 for
 a
 letter
 uh


that
 comes
 to
 my
 sister's
 place
 which
 is


a
 address
 I
 I
 register
 with
 a
 court.
 In


fact
 the
 the
 the
 government
 the
 DOJ
 in


their
 request
 they
 asked
 me
 to
 be
 uh


pre-manded
 uh
 meaning
 I'll
 be
 taken
 away


with
 in
 hungcuffs.


>> Uh
 I
 think
 they
 really
 wanted
 that
 photo


for
 PR
 reasons
 but
 the
 judge
 said
 look


he's
 not
 a
 risk.
 He's
 not
 a
 flight
 risk.


He's
 not
 a
 risk
 to
 society.
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 do
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do


that.
 In
 fact,
 the
 judge
 added
 one


sentence
 that
 said,
 uh,
 he
 doesn't
 he


does
 not
 need
 supervision,
 which
 is


actually
 a
 very
 interesting
 legal
 clause


I
 learned
 later.
 So,
 this
 is
 why
 when
 I


finish
 my
 sentence,
 I
 don't
 have


probation.
 I
 there's
 no
 parole.
 I
 don't


I
 don't
 need
 supervision.


>> Oh,
 wow.


>> So,
 um,
 uh,
 so
 there's
 some
 really


interesting
 stuff.
 Well,
 interesting


stuff
 that
 you
 learned.


>> How
 was
 that
 period
 for
 you?


>> Did
 anything
 bad
 happen
 or
 was
 it


>> Luckily,
 nothing
 too
 bad
 happened.
 Uh,


it's
 not
 it's
 a
 really
 bad
 experience


overall,
 but
 nothing
 like
 no
 physical


harm.
 uh
 there's
 no
 fights
 uh
 there's
 no


um
 there's
 no
 real
 extortion
 what
 I


found
 like
 so
 my
 prison
 consultants
 tell


me
 like
 know
 when
 you
 go
 in
 don't
 join


any
 gang
 stay
 to
 yourself
 uh
 uh
 just
 you


know
 just
 just
 stay
 to
 yourself
 uh
 be


quiet
 stay
 out
 of
 sight
 just


>> the
 minute
 I
 walked
 into
 the
 prison
 gate


the
 guard
 says
 well
 you're
 going
 to
 need


some
 protection
 here
 um
 I
 I
 hear
 the


Pacific
 Islanders
 are
 hiring
 so
 you


might
 want
 to
 join
 them
 like
 that's
 like


this
 is
 literally
 like
 the
 minute
 I


walked
 through
 the
 gate
 one
 guard
 was


saying
 this
 to
 me.


>> Wow.


>> I
 was
 like,
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 Right.


Um,
 and
 then,
 you
 know,
 after
 the
 whole


day,
 the
 first
 day
 was
 like
 the
 first


day
 is
 pretty
 like
 they
 take
 you
 through


so
 many
 process.
 You
 strip
 search.
 I


talked
 on
 CNBC
 like,
 you
 know,
 they
 they


strip
 search
 you
 and
 then
 you
 move
 to


your
 unit,
 which
 is
 like,
 you
 know,
 200


inmates
 there.
 Um,
 it's
 like
 three
 rows


of
 cells,
 20
 20
 cells
 each
 facing
 each


other,
 three
 floors,
 and
 there's
 a


common
 area
 in
 the
 in
 the
 bottom.
 Um,


and
 there's
 like
 200
 macho
 guys
 looking


at
 you
 and
 you
 know,
 you
 walk
 into
 a


cell
 and
 then
 um,
 but
 what
 actually


found
 out
 is
 um,
 they
 organize
 prisons


by
 race.
 Uh,
 so
 by
 ethnicity
 uh,
 they


group
 uh,
 so
 if
 you
 are
 a
 Chinese
 dude,


they
 group
 you
 with
 a
 Chinese
 dudes.
 Um,


and
 if
 you're
 like
 a
 white
 guys,
 they


group
 you
 with
 white
 guys.
 Black
 dudes


group
 with
 Mexicans,
 Spanish
 guys,
 no,


they
 they
 put
 them
 in
 one
 group.
 Um,


this
 actually
 does
 avoid
 a
 lot
 of


conflicts.
 um
 you
 are
 more
 likely
 to
 get


along
 uh
 with
 people
 of
 your
 own


ethnicity
 in
 terms
 of
 culture,
 customs


like
 know
 Arab
 there
 was
 one
 or
 two
 Arab


uh
 uh
 guys
 that
 you
 know
 they
 they
 pray


they
 know
 they
 have
 a
 different


schedule.
 Um
 so
 uh
 they
 put
 you
 in


groups
 by
 ethnicity
 and
 the
 guards


actually
 incur
 the
 prison
 encourages


because
 it
 reduces
 uh
 fighting.


>> Oh
 wow.
 Um
 and
 then
 once
 you're
 in
 your


group,
 uh
 if
 you
 have
 a
 problem
 with


somebody
 else
 in
 somebody
 some
 other


group,
 there's
 a
 group
 rep
 and
 the
 rep


will
 talk
 about
 it
 and
 you
 know
 there's


like
 a
 hierarchy
 and
 so
 u
 union
 reps


>> kind
 of
 like
 a
 union
 reps.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then
 they
 come
 together
 and
 they


hash
 out.


>> Yeah.
 They
 say
 look
 step
 stand
 down.
 We


walked
 we
 walked
 through
 it.
 So
 uh
 so


there's
 a
 system
 to
 it
 but
 I
 I
 I
 didn't


know
 any
 of
 this
 right.
 So
 I
 walk
 in
 and


then
 this
 um
 half
 ch
 half
 Asian
 looking


dude
 comes
 to
 me
 say
 look
 u
 my
 name
 is


Chino
 um
 welcome
 to
 our
 group
 uh
 he
 says


car
 welcome
 to
 our
 car
 I
 was
 like
 what


what
 should
 I
 shake
 his
 hand
 should
 I


not
 like
 am
 I
 joining
 this
 gang
 this


like
 it's
 yeah


>> that's
 crazy


>> yeah
 and
 this
 this
 guy
 is
 a
 Filipino


German
 mix
 uh
 there's
 not
 enough
 Asians


so
 they
 kind
 of
 group
 anything
 that's


kind
 of
 Asian
 and
 they
 also
 group
 the


Native
 Americans
 plus
 plus
 Pacific


Islanders
 like
 how
 the
 Hawaiians
 into


the
 same
 group.
 So
 our
 group
 only
 has


six
 people
 out
 of
 this
 200
 people.
 Um


and
 I
 was
 sent
 to
 a
 low
 security
 prison.


I
 should
 be
 eligible
 for
 a
 minimum


security
 prison
 which
 is
 one
 one
 level


lower
 where
 most
 of
 the
 white
 collar


crimes
 go.
 But
 because
 I'm
 not
 a
 US


citizen,
 uh
 they
 put
 me
 into
 a
 low
 which


is
 where
 all
 the
 drug
 laws
 are.
 So
 uh


wow.


>> Uh
 yeah.
 So
 that's
 a
 it's
 a
 crazy


experience.
 I
 have
 quite
 a
 lot
 quite
 a


quite
 a
 lot
 of
 details
 about
 this
 part


in
 my
 upcoming
 book.
 What
 was
 the
 first


thing
 you
 did
 when
 you
 got
 up?


>> A
 good
 shower.
 A
 good
 meal.
 Um
 the
 when


you
 first
 get
 So
 the
 shower
 is
 like


literally
 like
 you
 know
 box
 this
 big.


This
 is
 like
 a
 this
 is
 like
 a
 a
 cowboy


uh
 bar
 door
 like
 that
 covers
 the
 middle


part.
 They
 can
 see
 your
 legs
 and
 see
 see


your
 head.
 Um
 but
 it's
 hard
 to
 take
 a


shower
 without
 touching
 the
 wall.
 Um
 so


the
 when
 you
 get
 out
 of
 prison
 the
 first


time
 it's
 like
 taking
 a
 shower
 no
 you
 no


longer
 need
 to
 touch
 the
 shower
 wall.


That's
 like
 a
 luxury
 that's
 a
 luxury.


And
 uh
 also
 um
 uh
 there's
 very
 limited


fruits,
 uh
 very
 limited
 protein,
 like


good
 like
 proper
 protein.
 Um
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 carbs,
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 you
 know


uh
 bread,
 uh
 uh
 uh
 flowers,
 fried
 stuff.


Um
 very
 little
 veggies,
 very
 little


protein,
 very
 little
 fruits.
 Um
 I


haven't
 seen
 a
 whole
 fruit
 for
 like


months.
 When
 I
 saw
 when
 I
 got
 out
 and


saw
 like
 a
 plate
 of
 fruit,
 I
 was
 like,


"Wow,
 that's
 that's
 a
 luxury
 I
 haven't


seen
 for
 a
 few
 months."


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.
 Did
 you
 immediately
 just
 go
 back


to
 the
 UAE?


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 When
 I
 left
 prison,
 it
 took
 took


me
 about
 six
 26
 minutes
 from
 leaving
 the


uh
 the
 the
 the
 prison
 door
 to
 getting
 on


the
 airplane
 and
 flying
 out.


>> What
 were
 you
 thinking?
 Were
 you
 saying


to
 yourself,
 "I
 understand
 where
 they


were
 coming
 from,
 and
 I
 was
 at
 least


vindicated


on
 the
 parts
 that
 I
 felt
 were
 overreach.


I
 can
 see
 where
 they
 were
 coming
 from


with
 these
 first
 two
 things."
 Did
 you


say
 that
 to
 yourself
 or
 did
 you
 say


this
 was
 a
 total
 railroad
 and
 this
 is


completely
 unfair
 and
 how
 did
 this


happen
 to
 me?
 Why
 did
 this
 happen
 to
 me?


What
 were
 you
 saying
 to
 yourself?


>> I
 have
 some
 restrictions
 on
 some
 on
 what


I
 can
 say
 about
 the
 agreement,
 the
 plea,


etc.
 So,
 um
 I


>> I'm
 just
 talking
 emotionally.


>> Emotionally,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 be
 I
 would


just
 want
 it
 to
 be
 over
 with.
 Um
 and


remember
 that
 when
 I
 first
 got
 out,
 this


is
 still
 the
 Biden
 administration.
 The


election
 has
 not
 happened.
 Um,
 and
 uh,


uh,
 it
 wasn't
 clear
 who's
 going
 to
 win.


It
 wasn't
 clear
 the
 U.
 The
 US
 policy
 is


still
 the
 same.


>> You
 went
 in
 when?


>> I
 went
 in
 on
 May
 30th,
 2024,


>> and
 you
 got
 out
 four
 months
 later.


>> Uh,


September
 27th
 is
 the
 day
 I
 fully
 got


out.
 The
 election
 was
 in
 November,


>> right?


>> And
 by
 the
 way,
 sorry,
 at
 that
 point,


you
 had
 been
 in
 America
 for
 a
 year.


>> For
 you
 hadn't
 seen
 your
 kids
 in
 a
 year.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 at
 that
 point,
 like,
 I
 just


want
 this
 whole
 thing
 to
 be
 over
 with.


Um,
 and
 I
 thought
 they
 will
 continue.


Well,
 I
 was
 thought
 if
 they
 if
 the


policies
 continue,
 then
 you
 will
 still


be
 anti-crypto
 uh
 policies,
 um
 we'll


just
 whatever
 we'll
 just
 survive
 however


we
 survive.
 Um
 so,
 um
 yeah,
 so
 that
 that


was
 that
 was
 kind
 of
 the
 mentality.


>> So,
 when
 you
 get
 back,
 had
 you
 come
 to


terms
 as
 well
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 you


couldn't
 run
 Binance
 per
 se
 and
 that


that
 was
 part
 of
 the
 plea
 and


>> uh
 yeah,
 so
 I'm
 actually
 okay
 with
 that.


Uh
 stepping
 down
 was
 really
 really
 hard.


Um
 I
 actually
 cried
 out
 of
 it
 and
 the


the
 only
 other
 time
 I
 really
 cried
 was


like
 know
 when
 my
 father
 passed
 away
 a


few
 years
 ago.
 Um
 but
 after
 a
 few
 after


coming
 back
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 was
 actually


quite
 happy
 not
 to
 run
 Binance.
 I
 have
 a


lot
 more
 free
 time.
 Um
 and
 then
 if
 I


step
 down
 myself
 people
 say
 hey
 this


this
 guy
 ran
 out
 of
 stamina
 but
 like
 now


I
 can't
 run
 Binance.
 So
 uh
 so
 it's
 not


my
 fault.
 It's
 not
 your
 problem.
 It's


not
 it's
 not
 my
 choice.


>> Right.
 But
 after
 after
 a
 while
 I
 was


like
 know
 there there
 other
 there
 are


other
 very
 useful
 meaningful
 things
 I


can
 do
 with
 my
 life.
 Uh
 I
 am
 I
 think


overall
 I'm
 in
 a
 very
 fortunate
 position


right
 um
 I
 have
 resources
 um
 I
 have


enough
 money
 to
 do
 whatever
 I
 want
 to
 do


uh
 in
 terms
 of
 amling
 projects
 and


businesses
 etc.
 Um
 including
 like
 know


Google
 academy
 free
 education
 stuff
 like


that.


>> Yeah
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 that
 in
 AI.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> But
 before
 I
 do
 that
 let's
 just
 do
 a


little
 bit
 of
 the
 final
 kod
 here.
 Tell


me
 about
 the
 process
 to
 start
 getting
 a


pardon
 and
 getting
 it
 and
 what
 you
 had


to
 do
 and


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 so
 on
 the
 pardon
 um
 I
 don't


think
 anybody
 knows
 what
 the
 pardon


process
 is.


>> It
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 there's
 a
 process.


>> Like
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 the
 process


is.
 So
 what
 the
 process
 is
 you
 find
 a


lawyer
 who
 writes
 you
 a
 petition
 who
 put


all
 the
 arguments
 why
 you
 were
 you


should
 be
 pardoned
 why
 you
 know
 you
 were


over
 overly
 prosecuted
 etc
 etc
 right
 and


why
 you're
 a
 good
 person.
 And
 a
 pardon


what
 is
 it
 for?
 Is
 it
 effectively
 to


recognize
 overprosecution?


>> No.
 Partnership
 partnership
 er you
 raise


everything
 you
 had
 you
 had
 before.
 So


you're
 you're
 now
 a
 very
 normal
 person.


>> But
 the
 reason
 to
 be
 considered
 for
 it


can
 be
 anything.


>> Can
 be
 anything.


>> It's
 really
 just
 the
 discretion
 of
 the


president
 reading
 the
 petition.


>> I
 think
 so.
 Uh
 well
 based
 on
 my


understanding
 based
 on
 my
 understanding


is
 um
 uh
 the
 constitution
 grants
 the
 US


government
 or
 the
 US
 president
 to
 give


partisans
 and
 that's
 as
 about
 that's


about
 as
 much
 detail
 as
 it
 says
 I
 think.


>> Right.
 Okay.


>> Um
 and
 then
 how
 he
 does
 it.


>> So
 it's
 really
 about
 the
 social
 norms
 in


that
 moment
 and
 then
 how
 he
 interprets


>> I
 think
 so


>> those
 social
 norms.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 you
 know
 historically


most
 presidents
 pardon
 on
 the
 last
 day.


Right.


>> Exactly.


>> And
 then
 Biden
 I
 think
 started
 uh


pardoning
 some
 in
 between
 and


>> and
 he
 also
 did
 pre-pardons


>> which
 is
 which
 is
 which
 is
 a
 bit
 new


which
 is
 new
 and
 also
 crazy.


>> Well
 it
 was
 very
 new.
 Yeah.
 I
 was


largely
 around
 co
 for
 for
 for
 that
 but


>> yeah
 that
 that
 really
 caught
 a
 lot of


people.
 He
 he
 also
 pre-pardoned
 his
 son


for
 some
 for
 some
 for
 some
 period.


>> That's
 right.


>> Biden
 prayed.


>> It
 wasn't
 just
 the
 co
 stuff.
 That's


>> it
 wasn't
 just
 a
 co
 stuff.
 It
 was
 like
 a


period
 where
 nobody
 where
 a
 period
 of


time
 where
 nobody
 even
 talked
 about.


>> That's
 right.


>> It
 was
 like
 why
 do
 we
 need
 it
 to


>> That's
 right.


>> But
 anyway,
 so
 the
 process
 I
 believe
 is


there's
 no
 process.
 The
 president
 can
 do


whatever
 they
 want
 and
 then
 u
 so
 you


petition
 and
 you
 wait
 and
 then
 uh


there's
 there
 is
 a
 pardon
 SAR
 in
 the


white
 house.
 Uh
 I
 think
 her
 name
 is


Alice
 Johnson.
 uh
 she
 also
 went
 to


prison
 for
 many
 years.
 She
 wrote
 she
 she


wrote
 a
 really
 nice
 book
 which
 I
 read
 um


but
 your
 lawyers
 you
 know
 pink
 her
 say


they
 need
 a
 status
 update
 they
 need a


status
 update
 and
 there's
 no
 no
 and
 then


suddenly
 it
 happened.
 So
 uh
 uh
 that's


kind
 of
 my
 the
 the
 uh
 extent
 I
 know


about
 the
 pardon
 process.
 I
 don't
 think


anybody
 know
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 a


fixed
 process.
 I
 don't
 think
 anybody


knows
 what
 that
 is.


>> The
 question
 that
 some
 people
 can
 kind


of
 jump
 to
 is
 they
 think
 what
 must
 CZ


have
 done
 to
 try
 to
 get
 it.
 Do
 you
 want


to
 put
 that
 to
 bed?


>> Well,
 I
 didn't
 do
 much.
 I
 didn't
 do


anything.
 And
 then
 but
 I
 think
 look,
 um,


without
 the
 apartment,
 it's
 quite
 hard


for
 Binance
 to
 enter
 the
 US
 in
 a
 in
 a


proper
 way.
 I
 think
 if
 you


>> because
 you're
 the
 Ubo.


>> I'm
 the
 UB.
 Yeah.
 So,
 uh,
 and
 B
 I'm
 the


UBO
 of
 Binance
 and
 Binance
 US,
 right?


>> Without
 a
 partner,
 Binance,
 Binance
 is


severely
 limited
 to
 do
 stuff
 in
 the
 US,


>> right?


>> Uh,
 if
 US
 wants
 to
 become
 the
 capital
 of


crypto
 in
 the
 world,
 you
 cannot
 have
 not


you
 cannot
 not
 have
 the
 largest
 player.


you
 cannot
 not
 you
 cannot
 have
 US
 people


not
 be
 able
 to
 access
 the
 largest


liquidity
 pool.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 in
 crypto
 and
 also
 we're
 the
 we're


also
 one
 of
 the
 largest
 crypto


ecosystems.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think
 uh
 my
 guess


would
 be
 that
 look
 the
 president
 is
 a


pro
 crypto
 president.
 Um
 you
 obviously


um


>> he's
 had
 his
 own
 issues
 like
 the


debanking.
 Exactly.
 Where
 he's
 felt
 what


it
 feels
 like
 to
 be
 targeted.


>> Not
 only
 debanking
 he
 got
 34
 criminal


charges.


>> Yeah.
 Right.
 And
 he
 got
 like
 one
 of
 the


I
 don't
 know
 all
 the
 other
 charges
 but


>> that
 as
 well.


>> When
 I
 was
 in
 prison
 I
 saw
 on
 the
 prison


TV
 that
 he
 got
 34
 criminal
 charges
 like


and
 one
 of
 the
 charges
 was
 he
 brought


some
 document
 to
 his
 bathroom
 to
 read.


>> That's
 like
 that's
 crazy,


>> right?
 So
 I
 think
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 went


through
 that
 do
 the
 Biden
 DOJ
 will


probably
 help
 me
 a
 lot
 to
 get
 the
 pardon


because
 he
 will
 sympathize.
 He
 he
 knows


how
 aggressive
 that
 DOJ
 was,
 right?
 So


um
 that's
 that
 probably
 helped
 me
 in


some
 way.


>> So
 how
 do
 you
 spend
 your
 time
 now?


>> I'm
 still
 getting
 pretty
 busy
 now.
 So
 I


do
 giggle
 academy
 um
 you
 know
 this
 free


education
 platform.
 I
 consult
 with
 many


governments
 on
 uh
 to
 help
 them
 to


putting
 so
 sound
 crypto
 regulatory


policies.
 Um
 I
 get
 involved
 on
 the


investment
 side.
 We
 we
 invest
 in
 the
 um


blockchain
 AI
 biotech
 um
 the
 very
 active


team
 um
 uh
 doing
 investments
 and
 then
 uh


>> this
 is
 within
 Binance
 or
 outside
 of


>> this
 is
 outside
 of
 Binance.
 this
 is
 a


part
 of
 easy
 labs
 and
 then
 I
 also
 help


like
 mentor
 coach
 a
 few
 guys
 in
 the
 a


few
 funders
 in
 the
 B&B
 chain
 ecosystem


etc.
 So
 between
 all
 of
 those
 things,
 I'm


actually
 pretty
 busy.


>> Tell
 me
 about
 Google
 Academy.


>> So
 I
 thought
 no,
 it's
 possible
 to
 uh


develop
 fully
 digitize
 all
 education


content.
 And
 why
 is
 that
 important?


>> There's
 some
 numbers.
 I
 think
 7
 700
 to


800
 million
 adults
 do
 not
 are


illiterate.
 Two
 two-third
 of
 them
 are


women.
 And
 on
 top
 of
 that,
 there's
 about


500
 million
 kids
 who
 are
 not
 in
 school.


So
 if
 you
 add
 all
 of
 that
 up,
 that's


like
 1.2
 billion
 people.
 Yeah.


>> Uh
 who
 are
 not
 educated.
 Uh
 and
 this


>> 12
 12
 13%
 of
 the
 world
 population.


>> Yeah.
 And
 uh
 these
 are
 all
 in
 really


poor
 areas.
 Uh
 they
 there's
 just
 no


schools
 around
 or
 they
 just
 couldn't


afford
 to
 go
 to
 school.
 Um
 and
 the


schools
 are
 not
 very
 good
 today
 either.


Um
 the
 schools
 are
 like
 you
 know
 they


the
 schools
 average
 you
 out.


>> Yeah.
 No
 you
 um
 you
 have
 a
 classroom
 and


>> how
 is
 the
 software
 designed?


>> So
 it's
 just
 an
 app
 on
 a
 phone
 uh
 on
 a


phone
 or
 tablet.
 It's
 just
 an
 app.
 Um
 I


believe
 that
 we
 have
 enough
 technology


with
 you
 know
 gaming
 understanding
 of


human
 psychology
 with
 AI
 a
 single
 app


can
 deliver
 all
 the
 education
 content


you
 need
 and
 we
 can
 do
 that
 for
 free.


>> Have
 you
 looked
 at
 versions
 of
 this
 like


alpha
 school
 and
 do
 you
 have
 any


opinions
 on
 that?


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 I
 think
 alpha
 school
 is
 great.


Um
 Alpha
 School
 is
 really
 really
 good.


Um
 uh
 but
 you
 know
 it's
 high
 cost


>> high
 cost


>> right.
 So
 uh
 uh
 it's
 more
 I
 think
 um


>> I
 think
 Joe's
 software
 is
 called
 time


back.
 I
 think
 that's
 what
 it's
 called.


Yeah.


>> Have
 you
 had
 a
 chance
 to
 see?


>> I
 have
 not
 played
 with
 a
 with
 a
 lot.
 Uh


I
 did
 meet
 some
 of
 the
 founders
 there


and
 some
 of
 the
 key
 executives
 there.
 Um


uh
 they
 target
 a
 they
 solve
 a
 very
 hard


problem
 of
 making
 making
 the
 existing


education
 better
 where
 I
 solve
 the
 other


end
 of
 the
 problem
 making
 the
 education


accessible,


>> right?


>> Uh
 hopefully
 better
 later
 too.


>> And
 so
 your
 goal
 would
 be
 that


this
 is
 widely
 proliferated.


Are
 there
 schools
 in
 your
 view
 of
 how


giggle
 works
 or


>> No,
 I
 actually
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 schools.


Uh,
 I
 I
 want
 everyone
 to
 learn
 from
 one


app.


>> The
 software
 is
 very
 reward
 oriented.


>> Yeah.


>> Badges.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> I'm
 just
 going
 to
 ask
 the
 obvious


question.


>> When
 I
 looked
 at
 it,
 I
 was
 like,
 well,


>> badges
 is
 like
 a
 trail
 of
 breadcrumbs
 to


like


>> tokenize
 and
 earn
 and
 payments.
 Am
 I


just
 making
 this
 up
 or?


>> No.
 Uh,
 so
 I
 thought
 really
 hard
 about


this.
 Um,
 but
 I
 res
 I
 will
 for
 a
 very


long
 time
 resist
 issue
 a
 token
 on
 the


gold
 academy.
 This
 has
 pros
 and
 cons.
 Uh


when
 you
 issue
 a
 token,
 you
 can
 do
 the


rewards.
 You
 can
 earn
 uh
 learn
 to
 earn.


Learn
 to
 earn.
 Exactly.
 You
 can
 do
 a


bunch
 of
 stuff.
 You
 can
 do
 you
 can


incentivize
 teachers.
 You
 can
 to
 create


content.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 that's
 good.
 Um
 but
 the
 uh
 for
 me
 I


want
 to
 avoid
 the
 token
 because
 of
 me,


>> right?
 Because
 if
 I
 do
 a
 token,
 everyone


wants
 to
 buy
 the
 token
 and
 everyone
 on


the
 platform.


>> People
 want
 to
 speculate
 on
 the
 token.


>> People
 want
 to
 speculate
 on
 the
 token.


People
 the
 then
 I
 won't
 be
 able
 to
 tell


if
 people
 are
 they
 real
 kids
 learning
 or


they
 just
 farmers
 that
 that
 are
 trying


to
 farm
 the
 token.
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 I
 want
 to
 rem
 uh
 if
 I
 issue
 a
 tok
 if


Google
 issue
 a
 token,
 everyone's
 going


to


>> I
 have
 to
 be
 honest.
 I
 think
 giggle


sounds
 really
 incredible,
 but
 that
 was


where
 my
 reptilian
 brain
 went
 was
 the


>> everyone
 thinks
 about
 that
 obvious


thing,
 right?
 Yeah,
 exactly.


>> Um,
 but
 I
 want
 the
 giggle
 I
 want
 to
 be
 a


real
 free
 education
 platform
 instead
 of


a
 token
 platform
 instead
 of
 some
 crypto


thing.


>> Right.
 So
 if
 if
 there's
 a
 token
 then


people
 is
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 token.


>> So
 your
 goal
 is
 that
 you'll
 just
 deficit


finance
 this
 and
 just
 continue
 to
 kind


of
 proliferate
 this.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 that
 was
 my
 goal.
 But


what
 happened
 is
 um
 there's
 a
 community


project
 that
 donates
 um
 donated
 like
 $12


million
 based
 on


>> 12
 million$12


>> million
 US
 based
 on
 memecoin.
 Um
 and


this
 is
 not
 some
 like
 and
 I've
 only


spent
 like
 maybe
 three
 $4
 million
 on
 the


entire
 project
 so
 far.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 now
 you
 know
 it's
 actually
 net
 like


you
 know
 it's
 hard
 to
 give
 money
 away.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 uh
 it's
 hard
 to
 give
 money
 away
 with


positive
 impact.


>> With
 positive
 impact
 it's
 very
 very


difficult.
 So
 u
 very
 difficult.


>> So
 uh
 yeah.
 So
 my
 plan
 is
 I
 will
 fund
 it


for
 as
 long
 as
 it
 needs
 to
 reach
 that


goal
 uh
 of
 a
 fully
 um
 fully
 digitized


delivery
 of
 education
 in
 a
 gamified


sticky
 way.
 Let
 me
 ask
 an
 AI
 question


for
 a
 second.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 said
 that
 AI
 is
 this
 third
 pillar
 of


your
 life
 that
 you
 see
 these
 big
 waves,


right?
 Yep.


>> One
 of
 the
 most
 interesting
 things
 about


AI
 is
 that
 when
 you
 basically
 get
 one


level
 below
 the
 English
 and
 you
 start
 to


look
 at
 the
 embeddings
 and
 that
 the


layer
 of
 embeddings,


>> what
 you
 start
 to
 see
 is
 that
 it's
 this


machine
 readable
 language.
 It's
 not


English.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 there's
 a
 richness
 of
 information


there.
 It's
 perfect
 for
 agents.


>> It
 can
 traverse
 it.
 You
 can
 cipher
 query


it.
 You
 can
 do
 all
 this
 stuff
 that


allows
 you
 to
 make
 really
 incredible


leaps
 in
 productivity
 and
 otherwise.


>> Yeah.
 It
 stands
 to
 reason
 that
 agents


are
 also
 participants
 of
 commerce
 and


need
 payments
 and
 you
 know
 and
 I
 think


you've
 said
 this
 is
 like
 probably
 the


largest
 user
 of
 crypto
 at
 some
 point
 in


the
 near
 future.
 Describe
 that
 vision


for
 us.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 it's
 fairly


straightforward.
 I
 think
 as
 you
 said


right
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 clear
 soon
 we're


gonna
 each
 of
 us
 going
 to
 have
 like
 know


hundreds
 or
 thousands
 or
 millions
 of


edgings
 working
 for
 us
 in
 the
 background


and
 they
 will
 be
 transacting
 they
 will


be
 they
 will
 be
 moving
 money
 around


right
 so
 uh
 in
 theory
 if
 I
 want
 to


listen
 to
 this
 podcast
 you
 know
 your


people
 should
 pay
 a
 few
 cents
 to
 to


listen
 to
 it
 um
 whatever
 economic
 model


that
 you
 want
 you


>> more
 than
 that
 CC


>> sure
 of
 course
 sure
 but
 there
 was
 some


economic
 model
 right
 uh
 right
 now
 u
 you


know
 even
 last
 year
 we
 talked
 about


aging
 is
 buying
 tickets
 for
 us.
 It's
 not


quite
 there
 yet,
 but
 you
 will
 get
 there,


right?
 Uh
 they
 will
 book
 restaurants.


They'll
 pay
 they'll
 pay
 for
 hotels
 for


us.
 Um
 and
 then
 um
 uh
 the
 agents
 can


transact
 a
 million
 times
 more
 than
 us.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 use
 banks.
 Uh


banks
 just
 won't
 be
 able
 to


>> Well,
 banks
 won't
 onboard
 and
 AML
 KYC
 an


agent.
 Doesn't
 even
 make
 sense.


>> You
 can't
 do
 a
 KYC.
 They


>> It
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense,


>> right?
 So,
 uh


>> but
 also
 what
 agents
 will
 do
 is
 they'll


transact
 at
 a
 transaction
 volume
 and
 at


a
 rate.
 Yeah.
 It'll
 make
 the
 traditional


network's
 head
 spin.


>> Exactly.
 They're
 just
 not
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 support
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 And
 also
 um
 even
 stuff
 like


investments
 or
 trading,
 right?
 So
 today,


you
 know,
 you
 open
 the
 Binance
 app,
 you


look
 at
 a
 chart,
 you
 have
 to
 like,
 you


know,
 click
 on
 a
 price
 level
 and
 you


have
 to
 type
 in
 the
 price
 and
 a
 green
 or


red
 button.
 That
 shouldn't
 be
 the


interface.
 The
 interface
 should
 be
 like,


hey,
 look,
 convert
 10%
 of
 my
 stable


coins
 into
 B&B.
 And
 then
 you'll
 figure


out,
 okay,
 if
 you
 have a
 large
 position,


you'll
 do
 slowly
 over
 time.
 Uh
 if
 you


have
 a
 small
 position,
 which
 what
 be
 one


one
 market
 order?
 Um,
 all
 of
 that
 stuff


should
 be
 just
 happening
 in
 the


background.
 All
 right.
 So,
 the
 agent
 can


do
 this
 for
 us.
 Uh,
 you
 soon
 you
 will
 be


able
 to.


>> What
 is
 the
 most
 viable
 payment
 system


today
 that
 agents
 could
 rely
 on?


>> I'm
 actually
 not
 too
 sure.
 Uh,
 I
 don't


think
 there
 is
 any
 one
 that's
 super


that's
 what
 crypto
 project
 today
 do
 you


think
 comes


>> Oh,
 you
 mean
 crypto?


>> Yeah.


>> That
 agents
 could
 use
 theoretically.


>> Again,
 it's
 early
 days.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


speculate.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 name
 any


specific
 projects.
 Um,
 it'll
 cause
 some


token
 price
 fluctuations.
 Um
 but
 quite
 a


number
 of
 people
 are
 working
 on
 it.
 Uh


so
 especially
 recently
 with
 a
 more
 like


a
 AI
 agent
 social
 network
 thing.
 So
 it's


getting
 more
 and
 more
 hype.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 and
 uh
 yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 you


you'll
 get
 there.


>> Let
 me
 ask
 you
 about
 crypto
 in
 general


for
 a
 second.
 What
 is
 the
 role
 when
 you


see


a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 around
 free
 speech?
 What


is
 the
 role
 of
 privacy
 in
 crypto?
 One
 of


the
 things
 that
 I
 struggle
 with.
 If
 you


ask
 me
 am
 I
 a
 Bitcoin
 maximalist?
 I


would
 say
 no.
 Even
 though
 I
 was
 early,
 I


think
 my
 biggest
 issue
 with
 it
 is
 that


there's
 a
 lack
 of
 fungeability,
 which
 I


think
 is
 problematic
 to
 get
 to
 mega


scale
 and
 then
 there's
 a
 lack
 of


privacy.


>> I
 agree.
 It's
 probably
 the
 biggest
 thing


that
 will
 hold
 Bitcoin
 back
 from
 being


ubiquitous.
 Where
 does
 privacy
 play
 as


the
 world
 evolves
 as
 you
 see
 it?
 I
 think


privacy
 plays
 a
 very
 fundamental
 role
 in


our
 society.
 But
 right
 now,
 as
 you
 said,


I
 also
 think
 that
 uh
 Bitcoin
 and
 most


cryptocurrencies
 do
 not
 have
 enough


privacy
 features.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I
 think
 when
 Bitcoin
 was


designed
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 pseudo


anonymous
 but
 the
 fact
 is
 every


transaction
 on
 the
 blockchain
 you
 can


trace
 especially
 now
 you
 have
 a


centralized
 exchange
 with
 KYC.


>> Exactly.


>> Um
 and
 you
 know
 if
 you
 have
 like


it's
 actually
 very
 easy


>> and
 by
 the
 way
 we
 go
 always
 back
 to
 the


same
 argument
 which
 is
 it
 always
 goes


back
 to
 the
 corner
 case
 of
 well


somebody's
 using
 this
 for
 something


illicit.
 And
 I
 say
 there
 are
 those
 use


cases,
 but
 the
 overwhelming
 majority
 is


you
 buy
 a
 pack
 of
 gum,
 but
 tomorrow
 you


may
 buy,
 you
 know,
 you
 may
 want
 to
 buy
 a


certain
 movie
 or
 a
 video
 game,
 you
 may


want
 to
 buy
 a
 cigarettes.
 And
 it's
 not


for
 me
 to
 judge.


>> Yeah.


>> And


dollars
 are
 funible
 in
 that
 sense.


There's
 complete
 anonymity.
 We
 have
 no


idea
 about
 what
 it
 was
 used
 before
 that


I
 got
 my
 hands
 on
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 there
 there
 actually
 real


applications
 where
 privacy
 is
 extremely


important.
 uh
 if
 you
 book
 a
 certain


hotel
 and
 people
 know
 that
 hotel
 address


like
 blockchain
 hotel
 address
 receiving


address
 they
 will
 know
 that
 you
 will
 be


in
 that
 hotel.
 That's
 right.
 That's
 a


that's
 a
 physical
 security
 for
 for
 you.


That's
 right.


>> Right.
 So
 there
 there
 are
 real
 use
 cases


where
 privacy
 is
 very
 important.
 This
 is


why
 people
 don't
 publicize
 their
 home


addresses
 online.


>> That's
 right.


>> In
 many
 countries
 if
 you
 if
 you
 reveal


somebody
 in
 Japan
 if
 you
 re
 review


somebody's
 home
 address
 that's
 illegal,


right?
 So
 uh
 um
 so
 there
 they're they're


real
 there
 are
 real
 use
 cases
 for


privacy
 and
 which
 Bitcoin
 uh
 most


cryptocurrencies
 currently
 do
 not


provide.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 there's
 a
 counter
 argument
 okay
 law


enforcement
 wanted
 to
 track
 down
 bad


guys
 that
 can
 be
 done
 uh
 even
 with
 no


that
 can
 be
 done.
 Um
 we
 I'm
 supportive


of
 that
 but
 there's
 fundamental
 privacy


issues.
 So
 uh
 I
 do
 think
 that
 in
 the


future
 we
 uh
 as
 an
 industry
 need
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 uh
 evolve
 the
 privacy


features
 which
 no
 one
 no
 one's
 really


focusing
 on
 right
 now.
 There's
 a
 few


privacy
 focus
 of
 coins.
 I
 I
 was
 going
 to


say
 no
 one.
 Um
 but
 they
 are
 they
 don't


have
 much
 market
 cap.
 They
 don't
 they


don't
 have
 much
 size.


>> Right.


>> Yeah.
 Tell
 me
 about
 the
 book.
 It's


coming
 along.
 It's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 it's


it's
 a
 always
 a
 longer
 project
 than
 I


anticipate.
 Right.
 What
 was
 the
 point
 of


it?
 Was
 it
 is
 like
 catharsis
 or
 is
 it
 to


make
 a
 point?
 Is
 it
 to
 tell
 the
 story?


All
 of
 those
 things?


>> A
 bit
 of
 everything.
 It
 started
 because


I
 was
 bored.
 uh
 because
 I
 was
 I
 started


drafting
 when
 I
 was
 in
 prison.
 It
 was


just
 to
 get
 keep
 me
 busy
 uh
 because
 I


don't
 want
 to
 deal
 with
 you
 know
 I
 don't


want
 to
 be
 chatting
 with
 it
 just
 keep
 me


busy
 in
 in
 prison.
 So
 I
 started
 drafting


it
 and
 typing
 on
 on
 a
 very
 dumb
 terminal


and
 sending
 it
 to
 my
 assistant.
 Um
 and


then
 once
 I
 got
 out
 I
 was
 like
 well
 I


have
 enough
 that
 if
 I
 spend
 a
 bit
 more


time
 on
 it
 I
 can
 have
 a
 book.
 And
 then


um
 uh
 but
 but
 editing
 a
 book
 takes
 so


long.
 uh
 every
 every
 every
 pass
 takes


like
 two
 three
 weeks
 if
 you
 want
 to
 edit


a
 book
 because
 like
 know
 right
 now
 it's


like
 uh
 95,000
 words
 so
 it's
 like
 300


pages
 um
 and
 then
 um
 I'm
 also
 editing


the
 English
 and
 Chinese
 version
 so
 uh
 uh


so
 it
 just
 takes
 longer
 but
 the
 point
 of


the
 book
 right
 now
 I
 think
 is
 just
 to


get
 the
 story
 out
 I
 think
 there's
 many


misconceptions
 about
 who
 I
 am
 uh
 what
 we


what
 I
 went
 through


>> what
 are
 those
 misconceptions
 do
 you


think


>> well
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 negative
 media


about
 crypto
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 negative


media
 about
 uh
 um
 uh
 CZ,
 Binance,
 um
 the


entire
 industry
 and
 to
 some
 extent
 I


think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 negative
 media


about
 Trump
 the
 party
 etc.
 I
 that
 part


is
 not
 too
 heavy
 in
 my
 book.
 I
 just
 know


this
 is
 as
 simple
 as
 we
 we
 talked
 about


on
 this
 podcast
 but
 just
 for
 people
 to


understand
 like
 you
 know
 who
 we
 who
 I
 am


uh
 who
 B
 to
 some
 extent
 by
 extension
 who


Binance
 kind
 of
 is
 from
 my
 perspective.


>> Is
 it
 important
 story
 for
 your
 children?


>> I
 think
 so.
 Yes.
 Yeah.


>> Why?
 Um
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 for
 them


to
 un
 like
 no
 they
 see
 they
 of
 course


are
 more
 on
 my
 side.
 They
 know
 all
 this


media
 uh
 not
 the
 right
 stuff.
 Uh
 but


they
 haven't
 I
 didn't
 have
 time
 to


explain
 the
 story
 to
 them
 in
 this
 level


of
 detail
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 for


them
 to
 read
 this
 and
 they
 will


understand
 a
 lot
 more
 detail
 than
 what
 I


what
 I'm
 able
 to
 tell
 them
 verbally
 or


in
 person
 etc.
 Uh
 even
 though
 the
 book


doesn't
 contain
 everything
 but
 it's
 as


much
 as
 I
 can
 put
 in.
 What
 do
 you
 want


for
 your
 kids?
 I
 want
 them
 to
 live
 a


healthy
 and
 happy
 life
 however
 they


define
 it.
 Uh
 if
 they're
 happy
 just


being
 a
 normal
 person
 then
 that's
 good


for
 me.
 Uh
 if
 they
 want
 to
 do
 startups


and
 you
 know
 build
 companies
 and
 that's


great.
 Um
 if
 if
 they
 want
 to
 be
 artistic


etc
 that's
 great.
 If
 they
 want
 to
 do


human
 humanitarian
 efforts
 charity


that's
 also
 great.
 Um
 whatever
 they


figure
 out
 what
 they
 want
 to
 do
 I
 just


want
 to
 be
 there
 to
 support
 them.
 Um
 uh


yeah
 that's
 how
 similar
 or
 different
 is


that
 from
 what
 you
 got
 from
 your


parents?
 pretty
 similar.
 My
 my
 parents


didn't
 have
 pressure
 to
 on
 me.
 Uh
 my
 pre


my
 parents
 didn't
 pressure
 me
 to
 be
 this


and
 that.
 Like
 they
 didn't
 they're
 not


even
 like
 normal
 Chinese
 parents
 where


they
 want
 you
 to
 be
 a
 doctor
 or
 engineer


or


>> lawyer,
 engineer,


>> lawyer.
 Those
 that
 was
 my
 parents.
 Yeah.


Okay.


>> My
 parents
 didn't
 do
 that
 with
 me.
 My


parents
 like
 you
 can
 do
 whatever
 you


want.
 Just
 my
 parents
 said
 to
 me
 like


>> very
 unche
 very
 unche
 u
 my
 parents
 said


don't
 hurt
 yourself.
 Don't
 hurt
 other


people.
 Right.
 So
 don't
 do
 drugs.
 Uh


don't
 get
 into
 like
 you
 know
 don't
 don't


get
 into
 crime.
 Um,
 and
 then
 don't
 hurt


other
 people.
 Uh,
 so
 that's
 as
 simple
 as


like
 as
 I
 got
 from
 my
 parents.
 And
 uh,


yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 probably
 hear
 this
 and


they'll
 probably
 think
 that,
 and
 I
 think


this
 is
 a
 real
 compliment,
 by
 the
 way,


so
 don't
 take
 this
 wrong
 when
 I
 say
 this


this
 way.
 That
 could
 have
 been
 me,
 too.


Yeah.
 I
 think
 that
 we
 glorify
 success
 in


a
 way
 that
 makes
 it
 seem
 like
 it's


impregnable.
 It's
 like
 this
 very


quicksotic
 thing
 that
 happens
 and
 it's


not
 that.


>> No.


>> Yeah.


>> And


the
 reason
 why
 I
 can
 say
 that
 is
 that


when
 I
 spend
 time
 with
 you
 and
 I'm
 sure


now
 with
 the
 people,
 you
 know,
 rounding


two
 hours
 with
 you,


>> they'll
 think,
 man,
 this
 guy
 is


really
 normal.


>> It's
 a
 nor
 I'm
 a
 normal
 dude.


>> Exactly.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 say
 that
 like,


>> you
 know,


>> to
 me
 as
 well
 in
 this
 weird
 way,
 it's


like
 you're
 just
 a
 normal
 guy.
 And
 it's


like
 there's
 something
 really
 valuable


about
 working
 on
 things
 that
 you
 like


because
 then
 the
 time
 just
 passes.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 kind
 of
 just
 put
 your
 head
 up


and
 you're
 like,
 "Wow,
 okay,
 there's


something
 new
 to
 try.
 Let's
 go
 try
 that.


Let's
 go
 learn
 something."
 I
 want
 to


give
 you
 a
 chance
 to
 speak
 to
 all
 these


people
 who
 are
 probably
 thinking
 to


themselves,
 "Wow,
 that
 could
 be
 me."


>> Absolutely.
 I
 think
 um
 number
 one,
 I'm
 a


normal
 dude.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 I


know
 I'm
 not
 super
 smart.
 Uh
 but
 you


don't
 need
 to
 be
 super
 smart
 to
 to
 be


successful.
 You
 can't
 be
 too
 dumb,
 but


you
 can't
 be
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 be
 super


smart.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 things


like
 you
 know
 principles,
 values,
 uh


emotional
 quotient,
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 those


things
 come
 into
 play.
 I
 think
 um


there's
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 of
 luck
 as
 well.
 Um


but
 I
 think
 for
 most
 people
 um
 you
 are


in
 a
 situation
 where
 you
 are
 you
 usually


cannot
 change
 the
 situation.
 So
 what
 you


can
 only
 do
 is
 change
 yourself,
 right?


So
 if
 you
 just
 push
 yourself
 a
 little


bit
 every
 day,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 push


yourself
 too
 hard.
 You
 too
 you
 push


yourself
 too
 hard,
 you're
 gonna
 burn
 out


and
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 last
 long.
 But


you
 want
 to
 push
 yourself
 to
 like
 120%


110
 130
 somewhere
 in
 that
 range
 where


however
 you
 can
 last
 long.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 if
 you
 do
 that
 for
 like
 30
 years
 and


you
 get
 lucky,
 you
 will
 most
 likely
 be


relatively
 successful.
 You
 might
 not
 be


a
 you
 might
 not
 be
 a
 billionaire,
 but


you'll
 you
 you'll
 have
 a
 very


comfortable
 life.
 Do


>> you
 think
 that
 it's
 important
 to


maybe
 dispel
 the
 myth
 that
 being
 a


billionaire
 is
 not
 everything
 it's


cracked
 up
 to
 be?


>> Oh
 yeah,
 absolutely.
 U
 money
 is
 money.


So
 in
 in
 our
 life
 there's
 a
 few
 if
 I


kind
 of
 picture
 spiderweb
 graph
 right


money
 is
 only
 one
 tangent.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 So
 once
 you
 have
 enough
 having


>> one
 thread


>> it's
 one
 thread.
 Having
 more
 doesn't


help
 you.
 Uh
 in
 fact
 there's
 health


there's
 family
 um
 there's
 other
 things


that
 can
 keep
 you
 happy
 like
 your
 values


uh
 contribution
 positive
 impact
 like


that's
 intrinsic
 internal
 rewards
 that


you
 feel
 very
 happy
 about.
 Um
 a
 lot
 of


those
 things
 are
 extremely
 important.
 So


once
 you
 have
 enough
 money
 on
 this
 graph


you
 don't
 more
 doesn't
 make
 you
 happy.


Sometimes
 you
 have
 more,
 sometimes
 you


have
 less.
 Um,
 then
 how's
 your
 health?


Also,
 like
 there's
 another
 dime,
 time.


How
 much
 time
 do
 you
 have?
 Can
 you
 use


your
 time
 the
 way
 you
 want?
 Can
 you
 are


you
 working
 on
 the
 stuff
 you
 you
 want?


Are
 you
 spending
 with
 the
 people
 that


you
 you
 want
 to
 spend
 with?


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 and
 are
 your
 family
 healthy?
 Uh,


you'll
 be
 you
 were
 very
 lucky
 if
 your


family
 is
 all
 healthy.
 Like
 that's


that's
 already
 a
 huge
 gift.


>> Um,
 so
 uh
 and
 then
 your
 mental
 health
 is


also
 important.
 How
 to
 deal
 with


pressure
 etc.
 I
 somehow
 am
 very
 lucky
 to


have
 a
 very
 sort
 of
 stable
 uh
 mind.
 So
 I


think
 all
 of
 those
 things
 are
 extremely


important
 and
 all
 of
 those
 things
 you


can
 improve
 on
 uh
 instead
 of
 just
 money.


A
 lot
 of
 people
 only
 chase
 money
 but


sacrifice
 everything
 else.
 They
 work


really
 really
 hard.
 They
 don't
 have
 free


time.
 They
 are
 not
 spending
 time
 with


their
 family.
 Their
 health
 deteriorates


after
 10
 20
 years.


>> They
 don't
 enjoy
 the
 time
 that
 they're


spending
 on
 these
 things
 even
 to
 get
 the


thing
 that
 they
 have
 so
 much
 of
 that


they
 don't
 need.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 this
 is
 also
 the
 this
 is


also
 the
 part
 like
 you
 know
 I'm
 actually


very
 grateful
 that
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 run


Binance
 anymore
 now
 I
 have
 more
 time.


>> Yeah.
 Whereas
 before
 like
 even
 though


that
 was
 very
 enjoyable
 but
 on
 my
 other


questions
 I
 was
 not
 doing
 well.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 yeah.


>> CZ
 thanks
 for
 joining
 the
 online


podcast.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


I'm
 going
 all
 in.
