I've walked a lot in these shoes today.
These soles have ground
into the pavement of downtown Minneapolis,
the rubber mats of my car,
the linoleum of a gas station bathroom
and the Play Doh-crusted
carpet of a daycare.
Embedded in the tread,
a smear a toddler booger.
Yeah, a little leftover norovirus maybe.
Maybe if I'm really lucky,
a little fleck of dog poop.
Makes you sick
just thinking about it, right?
Audience: Ooh!
(Laughter)
(Cheers and applause)
So, yeah, that happened.
And while you may not have tasted
what I just tasted,
you felt what I felt.
Your sympathetic nervous system activated,
increasing your heart rate
and tensing your muscles.
Your anterior insula flared,
creating a feeling of disgust.
Little nausea, slight gag reflex.
Am I going to get sick now?
I don't know.
(Laughter)
But I do know this.
I am so glad you're uncomfortable.
Congratulations, truly.
Because that discomfort,
that is the first essential step
to creating confident kids.
And you can trust me on this one.
I make kids uncomfortable for a living.
This week I had an eight-year-old
stab me with a needle, twice,
took a kid into a basement
on a spider safari
and played Uno on the bathroom floor
with an understandably reluctant teen.
It's only Wednesday.
Now I’m not doing this stuff
because I’m an evil psychologist.
I'm doing this because as a pediatric
anxiety and OCD expert,
I'm a professional bravery coach.
I'd like to tell you about a kid
that I worked with years ago named Sammy.
Sammy was this sweet little third-grade
string bean who lived for adventure.
Bright, curious, optimistic,
could tell you everything
you honestly never needed to know
about airport design.
But Sammy had a fear: bees.
His brain appreciated bees,
vital pollinators.
His body, however, reacted
like they were flying yellow needles
with some anger issues.
As soon as those leaves turned green,
Sammy would initiate his own
personal bee safety protocol.
No sweets outside,
social distancing from the flowers,
even staying inside
during his family's cabin trips.
When Sammy got to me,
he and his parents had tried everything
to get rid of this anxiety.
Deep breathing, distraction.
No luck.
They had also debated the fear endlessly.
His parents would reassure him,
"You won't get stung."
Sammy reminded his parents they were not
fortune telling wizards in four words:
"How do you know?"
This phobia was stealing Sammy's childhood
one sunny summer day at a time.
When I sing Happy Birthday
with a cringing 12-year-old,
as loudly as possible,
in the grocery store produce section,
when I rank order photos
of vomit by chunk level,
or, yes, when I lick my own dirty shoes,
I don't just do it for fun.
Although, believe it or not,
sometimes it's very fun.
I do it for kids like Sammy,
because there is a method to this madness.
And after a decade of clinical practice
helping kids be brave,
it's become clear to me
that the method, exposure therapy,
isn't just the gold-standard treatment
for child anxiety and OCD.
It is a secret parenting playbook
for raising kids that thrive.
I want to share that secret
playbook with you today.
But before we talk about what to do,
we need to talk
about what we are up against.
It's a wild, worried
world out there, folks.
According to the National Survey
of Children's Health,
pediatric anxiety diagnoses
rose by nearly 30 percent
from 2016 to 2019.
And that was before COVID.
But you don't need stats or lists.
You have felt this,
because thanks to evolutionary biology,
when kids get anxious,
adults get anxious too.
Now I have two girls,
and home is the hardest clinic
that I have to work in.
When one of my little gals looks up
at me with the big teary eyes,
aka the mommy bat signal,
my nervous system does
the same thing that yours does.
It responds as though I have discovered
that the kitchen is on fire.
The amygdala, the watchdog
in our brain, starts barking
and the fight-or-flight system kicks in
and adrenaline surges,
and there is this instant
magical transfer of distress.
Her emergency becomes my emergency.
And in an emergency, what do you do?
You rescue the child.
Now I am proof that professional
degrees do not make you immune to this.
In my eldest daughter's
four short years of life,
I have become a one-woman
emotional SWAT team
more times than I can count.
I've answered questions for my daughter
when she clams up with a new adult.
I've sacrificed my sleep
and allowed our little human space heater
into the big bed for the night.
I have forfeited all privacy while peeing.
Because even that closed
bathroom door feels too far away.
Now all of this is what I call
parenting for comfort,
and it is the single most
natural and well-meaning
and deeply flawed thing that we do.
In the anxiety treatment world,
parenting for comfort
has another name: accommodation.
In my office, it looks like the parents
who removed everything
green from the house
because green meant vomit.
In Sammy's case, it looked
like kind, loving parents
who altered family plans
from outdoor fun to indoor fun.
No picnics at the park,
no meals on the deck at the cabin.
Parenting for comfort is not limited
to the parents of anxious kids.
It's also the common thread in the last
30 years of parenting trends,
from the helicopter parenting of yore
to the gentle parenting of today.
All of it is rooted in this idea
that healthy is a synonym for happy.
But I have watched this approach
play out hundreds of times in my office,
and I can tell you,
there are three big problems
with parenting for comfort.
First, it places an incredible
burden on parents.
It turns us into this stressed out member
of the feeling Secret Service
tasked with controlling
something we just can't:
another person's emotional experience.
Second, it teaches kids
that hard feelings are an emergency.
When we cancel that picnic in July
or open the bathroom door mid-stream,
we may not say it, but our actions shout,
“This feeling is a problem.”
Third,
it doesn't work.
We can't eliminate the pain
or mistakes of childhood.
They're a part
of the process of growing up.
We cannot guarantee emotional comfort
when discomfort is a side
effect of being alive.
If life won't promise comfort,
our parenting can't either.
Instead of parenting for comfort,
we need to be parenting for confidence.
When you parent for confidence,
you flip the script.
Our goal is not to get rid of anxiety,
uncertainty or distress.
Our goal is to build coping efficacy,
what I call "handleability."
This deep-in-your-bones
belief: “I can handle it.”
That is the heart of exposure therapy
and the key to raising kids that thrive.
Not avoiding hard feelings,
but experiencing them and still saying:
"I can do this."
Our kids don't require a comfortable life.
They need comfort with discomfort.
So how do you do this?
How do you parent for handleability?
When Sammy got to me,
all that he and his parents
had tried hadn't really worked,
and he was waiting to see
if I would waste his time too.
But I surprised him.
Rather than reassurance
or relaxation or distraction,
with Sammy and with hundreds
of other kids,
I used the recipe that exposure
therapists have relied on for decades.
A plus B equals C.
Anxiety
plus bravery
equals confidence.
Notice, anxiety is not the problem.
It's a core ingredient.
It's actually central
to how the brain learns safety
through what's called inhibitory learning.
Bravery only rewires the brain
when fear is present.
No one gets confident
they can handle hard stuff
without handling hard stuff.
I explained to Sammy
that worry is a bossy bully,
but bullies stop messing with you
once you say no.
In order to shrink worry,
he needed to show that bully who's boss
through practice being brave.
Now of course, Sammy was immediately
convinced by my explanation
and was like, "Ah, yes,
Kathryn, absolutely.
Uh, give me some bees."
No. Oh my gosh, he was like,
"Uh, thanks, hot take.
I will consider that."
(Laughter)
But this is where grown ups come in.
A growing body of research
from Yale Child Study Center and others
shows that we, as parents,
can change child anxiety
just by changing our own behavior.
If we parents go from prioritizing
comfort through accommodation
to prioritizing confidence
through practice,
we can make it much more likely
that kids will take that leap
into brave action.
Parenting for confidence
means supporting kids
at each step of the ABC recipe.
It means creating opportunities
for anxiety through adventure.
No kid jumps off the high dive
if you never take them to the pool.
I asked Sammy's parents
to give him some
confidence-building opportunities
by resuming their family's summer fun.
Walk to ice cream, smell the flowers,
eat the watermelon on the cabin deck.
Parenting for confidence also means
be the bravery you wish
to see in your child.
Show your kid that they can
handle this by modeling it.
Do the scary thing.
Sammy's parents didn't make Sammy
go outside on the deck,
but they did go out there and enjoy
some watermelon despite the wasps.
This is jumping in the pool
and showing the water's fine.
Third, we need to celebrate
confidence-building actions.
Cheer for and reward those brave steps.
Brave is hard work,
and hard work deserves reward.
Sammy built a bravery ladder
to face his fears.
It went from bee pictures,
to videos, to Dan.
Dan is a dead bee in a jar in my office.
(Laughter)
And finally, real bees.
Each step earned brave points,
which Sammy cashed in
for trips to new restaurants.
Now at this point, a warning.
Parenting for confidence
is brave parenting.
It asks for bravery from kids, yes,
but it requires bravery from parents.
Watching your kid panic
before the hockey game
and sending them out onto that ice anyway.
Asking them to eat in the den of snakes
that is a middle school lunchroom.
Or if you are me, peeling your protesting
one-year-old off your body,
passing them to a teacher at daycare,
and then walking out the door
before bursting into tears.
This is incredibly emotionally hard.
These actions ask us to place a bet
on our child's ability to cope
when they themselves are screaming,
"Don't bet on me."
But here's the secret.
The same way these anxious kids
can transfer their anxiety to adults,
adults can transfer
their own confidence to kids.
Thanks to social referencing
or how kids look
to adults to gauge safety.
If we stand our ground and remain calm,
we can lend our kids a nervous system.
Our job during that wave of anxiety
is not to get kids off the ride,
but to be their warm, steady anchor.
A lap bar on the roller
coaster of distress.
The secure base that says:
“Come what may, I love you.
I will always love you no matter what."
So, you want confident kids?
Let them struggle.
Not suffer.
Struggle.
Because confidence doesn't come
from praise or protection.
It comes from practice.
Practice being scared and doing it anyway.
It is hard, but it's worth it.
Because here's the best part:
bravery is contagious.
One act of courage
lights the way for the next.
Not just for your kid,
but for the people around them.
The kid who faces their fear of bees
doesn't just play outside again.
They raise their hand in class,
they try out for the school play,
they speak up when something is wrong
because they start to ask:
“What else am I capable of?”
And when they do, someone
else gets a little braver too.
By facing fear to do what matters,
you give others the faith
that they can do the same.
That is why this work matters.
Not just so your child feels less anxious,
but because all of our children
are inheriting a world of hard,
complicated problems.
Polarized communities,
economic disruption,
global uncertainty.
These challenges won't be solved by people
who need to feel good before they act.
They'll be solved by people who can say,
"This is hard,
but I can handle it."
In short, brave people.
Parenting for confidence is not a luxury.
It is a legacy.
Because brave parenting
creates brave kids,
and brave kids are the ones
that will change the world.
So what happened with Sammy?
Audience: Aw.
KH: That is the kid that wouldn’t take
an apple on a walk.
He looks good in the suit, doesn't he?
There he is.
And actually, here he is.
And he is not alone.
(Cheers and applause)
(Applause continues)
(Applause ends)
Friends, meet your world changers.
And while you look up here
at all of this bravery,
think of the kids that you know and love.
What sign do you want that child
to be able to hold six months from now
or 10 years from now?
What sign will you hold
to show them the way?
What shoe are you ready to lick?
(Laughter)
Revolutions begin with one person
doing something hard on purpose
where others can see.
So please, let's get
uncomfortable together.
Let's thrive together.
And let's raise them brave.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
