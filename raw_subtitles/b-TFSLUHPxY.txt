- The progress of the last
few centuries, in my opinion,
is about the greatest thing
ever to happen to humanity,
the greatest thing ever
for human life and health
and happiness and wellbeing.
If you care about those things,
if you care about humanity,
then I think you have to
care about understanding
where did that come from?
How did it happen? Why did it happen?
What drove it?
And ultimately, can we
keep it going, right?
Can the future continue
to see as much progress
or even more?
I think progress doesn't
happen automatically.
It's not inevitable.
Progress happens when we
choose to make it happen.
It happens through choice and effort.
And ultimately, to make progress happen,
we have to believe in it.
We have to believe that progress
is possible and desirable.
My name is Jason Crawford.
I'm the Founder and President
of the Roots of Progress Institute,
and I'm writing a book
called "The Techno-Humanist Manifesto."
- [Narrator] Chapter one,
The Philosophy of Progress.
- The mission of the Roots
of Progress Institute
is to establish a new
philosophy of progress
for the 21st century
and to build a culture of progress.
In recent years, the
dialogue and the discourse
around progress and humanity
has really heated up,
especially I think with the advent of AI
after ChatGPT launched.
It has just been a really
much more fiery debate
about these topics, about
technological progress,
about its implications for humanity,
about what we should do about it,
whether we should be
trying to slow it down,
stop it, control it, accelerate it,
and spreading to, you know,
it wasn't just about AI,
it was really about the
entire technology industry.
It was getting discussed
a lot in Silicon Valley,
and I thought that a different viewpoint
needed to get out there.
So, my background is in the tech industry.
My degree is in computer science.
I used to be a software
engineer, engineering manager,
and tech startup founder.
I was in that industry
for almost 20 years.
I started writing about the history
and philosophy of progress
almost as a side project in 2017.
In 2019 is when both my essays
and my writing started getting
a lot more popular online,
and also when that article came out
in The Atlantic by Tyler
Cowen and Patrick Collison
that coined the term 'progress studies'
and really galvanized
the progress movement.
And, long story short,
it was soon after that that
I decided to go full-time,
ultimately starting the
Roots of Progress Institute.
One important thing to know
about the idea of progress
is that it really didn't exist
through most of human history.
I'd say most peoples in
most places and times
didn't see progress as
some kind of an upward,
or didn't see history, as
some kind of an upward curve.
They saw history as more cyclical,
maybe, full of ups and downs,
or perhaps they even believed
in a declinist narrative,
a story of the past being a golden age
from which we have fallen
and perhaps will continue to fall.
This really only changed in the West
around the modern period,
around the 15, 1600s.
One of the key figures in
the history of progress,
and in particular the history
of the idea of progress,
is Francis Bacon.
This is an Englishman who lived
at the end of the 1500s into the 1600s,
did his most famous work
around the early 1600s.
He was one of these
figures around the time,
not the only one, but one
of the really key people
who was saying that progress
was actually possible.
At the time, there was
a big debate actually,
about whether the moderns,
whether the modern people of that era
could ever surpass the huge
achievements of the ancients.
They were looking back
to the ancient world,
the Greeks and the Romans,
and looking back at the ideas
that those people discovered,
what the Romans could do
with concrete, for instance.
And looking back at the great
works that they left us,
looking back at the
Colosseum and the aqueducts
and even the pyramids of Egypt.
And, you know, some people
at the time had this idea
that those ancients must have been a race
of moral and intellectual giants,
that they must have been, you know,
better than we were and
better than we will ever be.
That we can never surpass
their achievements.
That all we can do maybe is,
sort of, read the ancient texts
and reread them and try
to wring as much meaning
and learning as we can out of them,
but that we could never
surpass them, learn new things,
invent new things, and go forward.
And Bacon was one of the
people who was arguing,
no, there's a lot more to be discovered.
And he pointed out all of the things
that the ancients didn't know about.
They didn't know about the
Americas, for instance,
that had been discovered at, you know,
the end of the 1400s by the West.
They didn't know about gunpowder
or the magnetic compass or silk.
They didn't know about
the printing press, right?
The Gutenberg, movable
type printing press,
which was invented in the 1400s.
Bacon said, "There's nothing
in the art of printing
that is not plain and obvious."
And he's basically, you know,
my interpretation of this,
is he's saying, "Come
on guys, get with it.
Look, we can, you know, using
nothing that was non-obvious,
we can create this machine
that does this amazing stuff.
What if there are a whole lot more things
like this out there to be discovered?
What if there are a
whole lot more machines
like the printing press to be invented?
Just think of what we could do."
And he makes all of these
arguments in his book,
"Novum Organum," The New Method,
where he's basically saying,
he's trying to convince everybody
that this potential is out there.
And he's essentially saying,
"We've barely even begun to try.
We've barely even put serious effort
into the scientific enterprise."
And he was absolutely right.
And so Bacon pointed
to all of these things,
and he used all of this as
evidence to make his case
that essentially progress was possible,
that if we used the right method,
and he was really advocating
for an empirical method
in science, which was not
the standard at the time,
but he was advocating for, you know,
making more and better observations,
collecting them systematically,
putting them together, and
trying to find explanations.
And he said that if we do this,
and if we get better at doing it
and put more effort into
systematically collecting
and trying to explain our observations,
we'll be able to discover new things.
We'll be able to create new inventions.
There's a lot more stuff
out there that's like silk
and the compass and the printing press,
and that ultimately all
of this can come together
to endow human life with
new abilities and powers,
I believe is the phrase that he used.
He was absolutely right.
And his prediction essentially
took 200 years to come true.
It wouldn't come into full fruition
until the Industrial Revolution.
But he was absolutely one
of the historic visionaries.
He foresaw what was possible,
and he inspired generations
of people to pursue what,
you know, today is sometimes referred to
as the Baconian program
of science and invention
and ultimately of industry that,
according to economic
historians like Joel Mokyr,
turned into the Industrial Revolution.
So, there was a slowly building idea
of progress through the 1600s, 1700s.
As we got advancements in
science, we started to get,
you know, Newton's theory of the heavens.
We started to get,
and his theory of universal gravitation.
We started to get
developments in chemistry,
people really identifying
elements and, you know,
starting to work out the periodic table
and things like this.
And then with the Industrial Revolution,
certainly by the 19th century,
it started to become clear
that all sorts of new amazing
things were getting invented.
The railroad, the telegraph,
the telephone, the light bulb, right?
By the end of the 19th century,
it's very clear that Bacon
was absolutely right.
There were all of these inventions
out there to be created.
And it wasn't just, you know,
sort of an abstract idea for philosophers
to theorize about anymore.
It was a reality coming
into people's homes
and transforming everybody's lives.
So, by the end of the 19th
century, the beginning,
very beginning of the 20th century,
you've got this, you know,
very optimistic period.
People were ebullient.
They really saw, you
know, industrial progress
and technology and invention and science
as just this almost unstoppable
machine that was just,
you know, making things
better for everyone.
Now, there were definitely objections,
you know, don't get me wrong.
There were people all
through this entire process
who didn't see it as such a great thing,
all the way from Rousseau
in the 1750s who was,
you know, talking about how,
you know, he thought that
the progress of morals
in society was almost
inversely proportional
to the progress of arts and sciences.
And he hadn't even seen the
Industrial Revolution yet.
So, there was a lot of, you know,
kind of romantic backlash
against all of this science
and technology and industry.
But for the most part, people
saw this as a good thing.
And I think those, you know,
those kind of voices of backlash
were really in the minority
for a very long time.
But what happened was
people were a little naive
about how progress was going
and how it was going to go.
One, they saw it as kind of
automatic and inevitable,
as this thing that was just
going to definitely unfold
and nothing could stop it.
They thought that moral progress
and social progress
would also automatically,
inevitably unfold and go hand-in-hand
with progress in science and technology.
By the end of the 19th century,
people were very optimistic that
this new growth of industry
and expansion of trade and communication,
that all of it was leading
to a new era of world peace,
an end to war.
And of course, they were terribly wrong.
The world wars of the 20th century
violently shattered those naive illusions.
It was clear that technology
had not led to an end to war.
It had made war all the more
terrible and destructive.
It had given us machine guns,
the chemical weapon, the atomic bomb.
And so after the world wars,
there was an enormous
amount of soul searching.
It was this huge blow to the optimists.
People just didn't know
what to make of it.
What was all this technology doing?
The reason why people
got skeptical, fearful,
doubtful of the very idea of
progress in the 20th century
was because of some very real
costs and risks of progress
that people didn't necessarily know,
you know, what to do with.
A worldwide depression,
the rise of totalitarianism
around the globe.
We ran into environmental concerns, right?
Concerns about damage to the environment
and pollution and harms to human health.
We ran into concerns about
the risks of technology
and whether new technology
could create new safety hazards.
As early as the 1930s, you hear people,
you hear historians saying and writing
that the idea of progress
has been discredited.
The doctrine is disputed.
And asking, Carl Becker asked this,
what if anything can be said
for the progress of mankind?
Can we still believe in
progress, essentially?
And so you've got this whole generation
that was just wondering,
are we on the right track?
You know, what are we doing?
Do we even know what we're doing?
And I think it was a
real cultural crossroads.
I think you could have
had, in that moment,
maybe historians and
philosophers and other thinkers
who came forth to say,
look, the idea of progress isn't wrong.
We were a little naive
about how easy it would be.
We were maybe a little blind
to the costs and risks.
We need to be more careful
and thoughtful about it going forward.
But progress is still an ideal.
I think there were some
very real questions there.
I think that the costs and
risks of progress are real.
Progress is messy, and we're
not gonna get anywhere,
and we're not gonna do humanity
any favors by denying that
or by claiming that progress
is sort of always and everywhere good,
or that it's automatically good,
or that we don't need to
do anything to steer it
or to mitigate the problems.
We absolutely do.
And we're only going to create
a better world for people.
We're only gonna create human life
and flourishing and wellbeing
if we acknowledge the
costs and risks of progress
and then step up to actually
solve them and to move forward.
And instead, what happened is
you had these very strong
counter-cultural voices,
this kind of backlash,
this romantic backlash against
the very idea of progress
that said, look, maybe
modernity was a mistake,
maybe progress itself is the problem,
and maybe we should
slow it down or stop it
or even go backwards.
And this is, I think,
where you got the sort
of late 20th century fear
and skepticism about the
very idea of progress itself,
and a kind of, you know,
cultural movement that was based
on a deep skepticism of
technology and industry,
and that was really looking
for ways to slow it down,
stop it, or even reverse it.
When we use the term progress, you know,
by itself without any kind of qualifier,
I think ultimately what we're referring to
is the idea that progress
in science, technology, and industry,
that material progress ultimately
supports social and moral
and human progress and ultimately
promotes human wellbeing.
I deeply believe in the power
of science, technology and industry.
I deeply believe that these things
are a positive for humanity overall.
But I think that ultimately
the reason that they're good,
they're not ends in themselves.
Progress isn't only about
base material values or needs.
It's not just about having a full belly
and a roof over your head and,
you know, warm clothing to wear.
You know, those things are great,
but that's not all that life is about.
Life is about spiritual values, as well.
Life is about excitement, adventure,
knowledge, romance, curiosity.
Life is about fulfilling
your own potential
and being everything that you can be,
exercising your capabilities.
But the thing is that
material progress helps us
with those spiritual values, as well.
It gives us the time and
space to pursue self-education
and knowledge projects,
to pursue art and philosophy.
We need, you know, the base,
we need to be able to make a living
and to feed ourselves, you know,
on 40 hours a week if
we're gonna have the time
to pursue all those other things.
Information technology
today gives us connection
to all of the knowledge
and art and philosophy
and culture of the world,
which is greatly spiritually enriching.
It allows us to stay in touch with friends
and family around the globe,
you know, wherever they may be.
It allows us to stay more
in touch with our own past
and to look up, you know, photographs and,
you know, find things online,
learn about our ancestors and
our culture, our heritage.
It gives us all kinds of different,
you know, vocations to pursue.
So, if one of the spiritual values
is doing work that you love,
you know, a few centuries ago,
probably, you know, your best bet
was you were gonna be a farmer.
And if you weren't gonna be a farmer,
maybe you could be some sort of artisan
if you were lucky enough
to get into a guild,
if your father did,
you know, the same job.
But there was really not a lot of choice.
Today, there is an
enormous amount of choice,
and you can be a farmer
if that's your calling,
and for some people it totally is.
But you can also be a spreadsheet jockey,
or you can be a designer,
or, you know,
you can do all sorts of, you know,
an enormous number of things.
Between the work that you do,
the knowledge that you pursue,
family and personal connections,
all of these spiritual values,
they're all supported by material
and technological progress,
by more wealth, more leisure time,
and more technology to go
pursue all those things.
Material progress actually helps us
to enjoy more of the human experience.
In a way, technology actually
helps us become more human.
But when people are
skeptical of that link,
when they don't believe
that material progress
necessarily is good for humanity,
you'll find that what they say
is they don't believe in progress
and they won't even use the term,
or if they use it, they'll
only put it in scare quotes,
like 'so-called progress.'
- [Narrator] Chapter two,
The Technologies of Progress.
- I think about technology and industry
in maybe six broad categories.
I think about agriculture, manufacturing,
which includes materials and construction,
energy, transportation, information,
and broadly medicine or health.
I think if you look at
those six categories,
you've got a good overview
of technological development
from the Stone Age to today and,
you know, sort of the major
areas of industrial civilization
that give us our standard of living and,
you know, keep things going.
Agriculture was sort of the
main focus of most people
for most of the last 10,000 years.
Until the industrial era,
agriculture was so unproductive
that half to three
quarters of the workforce
had to be farmers just in
order to grow enough food
to feed the entire population.
It was enormous amount
of labor, dawn to dusk,
you know, the whole calendar was arranged
around all of the things that
you had to do on the farm,
with the livestock, with the crops,
with tilling the soil.
And yet despite this,
famine was still common.
Today we have a much smaller percent,
you know, small, single-digit percent,
maybe 3% of the population growing food.
It could be even less if we, you know,
if we wanted to just
subsist on the bare minimum.
We eat a much, you know,
greater variety of foods,
including a lot more meat in our diet.
And famine has been eliminated
from not all of the world,
but from much of the world.
So, we devote a lot less
of our resources to it.
We get a lot more quality,
it's a lot cheaper,
and it's a lot more reliable.
For most of human history,
the main sources of power
were wind, water, and muscle.
And muscle was, of
course, animal and human.
This was true up until the 1700s.
This was how we did everything,
moved everything, did all kinds of work.
And the challenges with
those energy sources are,
so, they're extremely limited.
Wind and water can only be
sourced in certain places, right?
If you want to build a water mill,
it has to be on the river.
It has to be sighted on the river.
A windmill only turns when the wind blows.
And neither of these power
sources can be scaled up, right?
If you're not getting enough power,
there's only so much power
that you can get out of the river.
At a certain point, you're just using
all of the power that
the water will give you.
Same thing with the wind.
So, they're really energy
sources that have to be used
when, where, and as they are found.
Animals I guess can be moved around,
but they also have limitations.
Animals get tired.
And again, they can only
output so much power, right?
A horse has a certain, you know,
power density and that's all that you get.
So, this was a fundamental limitation
on all of industrial civilization
such as it was,
pre-industrial civilization,
you know, up until the 1700s,
the Industrial Revolution.
The reason that the steam engine
is sort of the quintessential, like,
representative, paradigmatic invention
of the Industrial Revolution
is that it changed this equation forever.
What we could do with the steam engine
for the first time ever
was to take fuel sources
that generate heat
and turn that into motion.
Fuel that, by the way, could
be transported anywhere,
that could be stored for later use, right?
So, we broke the boundaries
of time and space.
We didn't have to use the energy
where and when it was found.
We could store it, we could transport it,
we could use it anywhere, anytime,
have 24/7 power and scale it up massively
far beyond any previous power source.
And so this was absolutely fundamental
to driving the Industrial Revolution,
and it's why we look to the
steam engine as that thing that,
in a sense, started it all.
Energy is absolutely
fundamental to the economy.
It drives the tractors and the
machines that do agriculture,
that grow our food,
it drives industrial processes
that create synthetic chemicals,
it drives the factories that
create all of our goods,
it drives all of our transportation,
both for getting people around
and of course our cargo logistics network.
It powers absolutely everything.
And without energy, you just can't do
all of the things that we do.
So, yeah, there is a
very close relationship
between energy usage and GDP
or other measures of wealth.
Compared to today,
there was very little
medicine to speak of until,
you know, perhaps the 19th century.
Infectious disease, I would say was the,
you know, was the most rampant.
It was everywhere.
Smallpox, for instance,
absolutely horrible disease,
killed something like a sixth
to a third of the people
who were infected by it.
You just expected to get it
at some point in your life.
You hoped that you got it early
and had a mild case in childhood,
so you'd kind of get it over
with and get your immunity.
You know, this was just
what people lived with
and what people accepted.
Even in the beginning of
the 20th century in the US,
I believe about half of deaths
were from infectious disease.
And now we have brought
that down enormously.
It's a much smaller fraction.
Maternal mortality.
Being pregnant and giving birth to a child
was extremely dangerous
by today's standards.
I believe maternal mortality, even in,
you know, late 19th
century, early 20th century,
was something like 1%,
which, you know, compared to today,
it's orders of magnitude lower.
Child mortality.
For most of human history,
almost half of people did
not survive to adulthood.
Almost half died as children,
sometimes either in the very young years
or in the teenage years.
It was just expected that, you know,
a family that might have a
standard, say, six children,
a woman would bear six
children maybe on average,
you know, in her life,
and maybe easily three of those
would not survive to adulthood.
It was utterly tragic and
yet completely common.
So, today, obviously we have
come an extremely long way.
A mother dying in childbirth
in developed countries,
or children, you know,
dying before reaching
adulthood is a rare tragedy.
Most people get to live into
their sixties, seventies, or eighties.
It's just a real
transformation of human life.
Transportation is another
one of these areas
where there was seemingly no progress,
at least along certain metrics for,
you know, thousands of years.
Somebody pointed out that, you know,
George Washington
traveled at the same speed
as Alexander the Great, basically, right?
They had horses, they
had wagons, but you know,
there wasn't something
fundamentally different.
And of course, communication also,
if you wanted to get a letter
or any kind of a message,
it could only go as fast
as the transportation.
Transportation over
land was extremely slow.
By water, a little bit faster,
but of course limited to the water routes.
So, it was really not until the 1800s
with especially the advent of the,
well, the steam boat and
especially the locomotive,
that this began to be
fundamentally transformed.
The speeds that
locomotives could travel at
and the reliability and
the ability to haul cargo
and so forth were just, you know,
multiples beyond anything
that you could do
with horses and wagons.
And it was fundamental
to transforming society.
Up until the 1800s,
communication could only move
as fast as transportation.
So, the advent of
electronic communications,
first, the telegram, later, the telephone,
radio, television and so forth,
all those things starting in the mid-1800s
really disconnected our information
from our physical atoms
infrastructure, right?
We could now send
information over, you know,
through electrons,
through electric fields.
The telegraph and other
electronics communication media
really broke this link
between our information
and our material universe,
you know, the atoms traveling around,
and that was enormous.
Prior to the Industrial
Revolution, you know,
most products were made by hand.
Now, today, they are mass
produced in factories,
and the difference is one of, you know,
orders of magnitude of productivity,
which ultimately means both benefits
for the consumer in terms of cheap goods
and for the laborer in
terms of higher wages.
Another story that has received,
I think, a lot less attention,
but is just as important,
is the story of precision
in manufacturing.
We invented machine tools that were able
to create much more precise parts,
and this allowed us to
create new kinds of machines
that could perform much
better at their jobs.
It also made the process of assembly
much faster and more efficient,
because now we could create parts
that all fit together.
It used to be that, you know,
parts would be made for a machine, say,
and you'd be assembling
a clock, for instance.
And all of the parts,
the gears and everything,
wouldn't necessarily fit together.
And in order to make them fit together,
the person assembling this thing
would have to file them by hand.
So, sort of, you know,
take a look at a piece,
try to fit it together, doesn't quite fit,
file it a little bit, okay?
You can imagine how much
this slows you down.
Even as late as the early 20th century,
when Henry Ford was doing his
assembly line to make cars,
you know, one of the
things that he insisted on
was we have parts that are made to fit
and do not need to be filed to fit.
And that was only possible
through precision machining
and through the development
of machine tools.
The third big theme is,
as I alluded to with, you know,
Henry Ford and his assembly line,
is the organization of the factory itself.
The sort of classic, traditional thing
was a master craftsman
who would, you know,
make every piece of a product himself.
And what we got through the
Industrial Revolution, in part,
was more efficient ways
of organizing a factory,
ultimately leading to
the system known today as mass production.
Now, you think also about,
what does this take in order
to have this kind of economy?
One thing it takes is larger networks,
really larger markets,
larger networks of commerce.
You can't really do this in the era
where every village is served
by its own local craftsmen,
like a millwright or a carpenter.
You kind of need to do it in the era
where people can
advertise over wide areas,
where you've got newspapers, right?
Where people can order, you know,
send in an order for a machine,
you need effective postal service.
And then where the machine
can be actually transported,
you know, to the customer,
and so you really need an
effective transportation system
of canals and railroads and so forth.
And so it was really these developments
that started to create the larger markets
that would allow more
specialized machinery,
the investment in both inventing
and then creating the
manufacturing facilities,
to create that kind of machinery.
So, this is a great example
of how progress builds on itself.
Progress begets progress.
The long-term pattern of
progress over human history
is that progress accelerates.
It's not just a constant percentage,
you know, growth each year.
Over the long-term,
that percentage growth
rate actually increases.
If you, you know, think back
to the pre-agricultural era
where we were living in
hunter-gatherer tribes,
there was progress.
There was progress even in stone tools
if you look at the evolution
of them over millions of years.
They got better and more sophisticated
and more adapted to different uses.
But that progress would happen,
you know, you'd get a new invention,
maybe what, every 1,000 years,
10,000 years on average?
By the time you get to
the agricultural era,
you know, now you're getting
inventions every century or so.
And then, you know, more recently,
maybe you get huge
inventions every decade.
And maybe now it's every year,
or soon it'll be every year.
And so that is the
accelerating pace of progress.
Things move faster today,
even on a percentage basis.
Why does this happen?
The fundamental reason is feedback loops.
Progress begets progress.
When we make progress,
sometimes the progress
that we make is in some,
the invention or the new
technology or infrastructure,
is so fundamental that it feeds back
into the process of
making progress itself.
So, technology, for instance,
when we get new manufacturing technology,
that allows us to create, you know,
all sorts of new types of machines,
higher precision machines, or lower cost,
or, you know, whatever that
can do all sorts of new types of things.
When we get new communication technology,
that allows ideas to be recorded
and to spread much faster.
And now today we can search ideas,
you know, much better than we could
before the advent of
databases and search engines.
With the combination of communication
and transportation networks,
we have much larger markets.
And having global markets means that
there is much more ability to invest.
You can now, you know,
invest an enormous amount in creating
a specialized machine
or creating a new drug
because your market isn't
just your local village
or even your town or your nation.
It is, you know,
your market is potentially
the entire world.
The accumulation of wealth, right?
The more surplus wealth we have,
the more wealth we can drive back into R&D
and building out infrastructure,
and then the more that allows us
to accelerate the economy,
which creates more wealth.
So, there's another virtuous cycle.
Even world population.
The better we get at
supporting human life,
the more the population grows.
And that's been the pattern, at least,
you know, up until now.
The more people we have,
the more brains we have working
on all kinds of problems.
The more scientists, the more researchers,
the more inventors, the
more business founders,
all of these people working on, you know,
all of the different
problems of human life.
The more people we have, the
more people can specialize
into niche fields and go
deep into those fields
and become niche experts.
And so the more people we have,
the more progress advances.
And the great thing about this
is anytime somebody solves one problem
or figures out one great idea,
that idea can
almost instantly be shared
with the entire world
and, you know, can be replicated all over.
This is the amazing thing that the
Nobel winning economist Paul Romer
sort of figured out and
formalized in his models,
is that the way that
growth happens is that,
and the way that growth accelerates,
is that ideas, once they are discovered,
in economist terms, they are non-rival.
We can all share them without diminishment
of the value of the idea.
So, the more people we
have, the more ideas,
and everybody gets to share
in the benefit of those ideas.
So, there's a virtuous cycle
between actually making progress,
believing that we can make progress,
and then investing in progress
motivated on that belief,
and then making even more of it.
And at least up until, you
know, the 20th century,
that cycle was accelerating
and was a cycle that itself
was driving progress.
- [Narrator] Chapter three,
The Future of Progress.
- I do think that we've seen a,
what I hope is a temporary
slowdown in scientific,
technological, and economic progress
over the last roughly 50 years.
I didn't believe this at first
when I started hearing
people talking about it,
but the more I looked into
the history of progress,
the more I realized
that I think it's true.
We've seen a lot of progress,
of course, in information technology,
in computers and software.
There's really been no slow down there,
but in manufacturing, construction,
transportation, energy,
all of these, you know, all these areas,
we're still using basically
the same fundamental technologies
that we used in the
1960s and 1970s, right?
We're still using electricity,
and mostly
fossil fuel-based electricity
as our main power source.
We're still using the
internal combustion engine.
We're flying on basically
the same kind of planes
that we flew on in the 1960s.
They actually fly a
little bit slower today.
We're using the same basic
sort of mass manufacturing,
you know, factory processes.
So, you know, all of this stuff has seen,
it's seen improvements, certainly.
It's seen a lot of
incremental improvement,
cost improvements, safety improvements,
but it hasn't seen the kind
of massive paradigm shifts
that we saw in an earlier period.
Consider the period
from about 1870 to 1920.
So, there's a 50-year period
that ended a hundred years ago.
In that time, we saw roughly, by my count,
five major revolutions in
different aspects of the economy.
So, we saw a revolution
in electrical power,
the entire electrical industry,
generators, motors, light bulbs,
all of that was created in that time.
We saw a revolution with the invention
of the internal combustion engine
and the vehicles that that made possible,
the automobile and the airplane.
We saw a revolution in
communications technology
with the telephone and radio.
There was a revolution
in applied chemistry,
and we got all sorts of synthetics.
We got synthetic plastic,
we got synthetic fertilizer.
And then there was a
revolution in public health.
We got the germ theory
and some of its first applications
with better water sanitation,
new vaccines, and all these things started
to really decrease mortality
rates for the first time.
So, five revolutions across the board.
If I look at the same
period 100 years later,
so 1970 to 2020, roughly
the last 50 years,
I count one and maybe two revolutions.
There was definitely a revolution
in information technology,
in computers and the internet,
and maybe you could count one
in genetic engineering and biology.
But again, those areas like energy,
manufacturing, transportation,
those just have not seen the
same fundamental breakthroughs.
So, you know, people sometimes look back
at the last 50 years and they say,
how can you say that
progress has slowed down?
Look at the internet, look at Wikipedia,
look at, you know, now AI,
and all of that is absolutely true.
And it's amazing progress,
and I don't wanna discount it.
I think sometimes people kind of dismiss
the progress in bits as
if it's not so important
or as if it's unimpressive,
and absolutely not.
We all have supercomputers in our pocket.
We're all connected to,
you know, each other,
and to all of the world's knowledge
and entertainment and everything
in real time. It's absolutely amazing.
But a similar revolution happened
between 1870 and 1920 when we got,
the telephone and radio.
That was also a revolution
in communications technology.
We got, you know,
that also connected people
and created broadcast technologies
for the first time and so forth.
And yet on top of that,
we also got revolutions in energy
and manufacturing and
construction and, you know,
transportation and public health
and synthetic chemistry and so forth.
So, you know, I think you
could maybe convince me
that the internet was a bigger deal
than telephone and radio,
but I don't think you could convince me
that computers and the
internet by themselves
are a bigger deal than all
five of those revolutions
stacked on top of each other.
So, yeah, I really think that progress
has slowed down a bit
in the last 50 years,
although, of course, it's still faster
than at any time before
the Industrial Revolution.
I think the lesson of
the relative slowdown
in progress over the last 50 years
is that progress is not
automatic or inevitable.
It doesn't just barrel along.
It depends on us, and it
depends on our choices.
It depends on us believing in progress
and wanting to continue to invest in it.
It also depends on the
quality of our institutions.
And I think a few things
happened over the last 50 years
that have contributed to the slowdown.
One is the growth,
or really the overgrowth,
the overreach of the regulatory apparatus.
I think a lot of regulation grew up
in the last several decades
in order to confront
some of the costs and risks
and hazards of progress.
And those problems are very real.
But I think the way that we've
built the regulatory state
has led in many areas to overreach
and to too much overhead.
It's become almost impossible
to build anything in the United States
because of all the permitting
that you have to get.
We can't build housing, we
can't build infrastructure.
We can't even build the
clean energy infrastructure
that everybody
believes and says is necessary
for the energy transition.
And a lot of this is
because of permitting reform
and other kinds of regulations.
So, we're really getting in
our own way in that sense.
The other institutional
challenge that I really see
is the way that we organize
and manage scientific research.
Scientific research today,
there's an enormous amount
of overhead to grant-seeking
and the way that we fund it through
the sort of grantmaking process
arguably leads scientists
to be much more conservative
in the kinds of projects
that they attempt.
We really need, I think,
more bold, kind of risk-taking,
and ambitious projects in science,
and we're not getting it in part
because of the way that science is managed
and the way that it's funded
and the way that grants are made.
Finally, I think the third big reason
for a slowdown in progress is,
again, just a kind of loss
of confidence and ambition
and enthusiasm at a civilizational level.
I think we need to continue
to tell the story of progress
and to talk about how
good and important it is
in order to motivate talent and resources,
and especially young
people, the next generation,
to actually step up and
move progress forward.
Each new generation has to sort of pick up
that torch of progress
and carry it forward.
And, you know, if nobody
believes in the future,
then nobody's gonna build it.
I am hopeful that we'll be able to
turn around this relative
slowdown in progress,
and more importantly,
to turn around our attitudes for progress.
We really soured on the concept
in the late 20th century.
There are a couple of things that I see
that give me that hope.
One is we are continuing to make progress
and in some ways there are
some really exciting things
on the frontier.
If you believe some of the press releases,
fusion energy is almost here,
and there may be companies
delivering, you know,
fusion energy on the grid
within a matter of years.
Artificial intelligence is an
incredibly exciting frontier
and could be a new general
purpose technology that could
boost growth in the entire economy.
Genetic engineering, we've got the first
mRNA-based vaccines just within
the past couple of years.
We got CRISPR just within the past
decade or so.
There are all of these things
that are on the frontier
and that are incredibly exciting.
I would say also just by
watching Silicon Valley,
and more broadly the sort of tech
and science community,
I am seeing a new generation of founders
with huge ambitions.
And ambitions not just in bits,
but in atoms and in cells and joules,
across biology and
energy and manufacturing.
You look at what's happening
in El Segundo today
with the companies doing, you know,
new forms of energy and
space and manufacturing and
longevity companies and longevity
funds getting established.
There's all sorts of
really exciting stuff,
and founders today,
they're not just building
social media apps and
SaaS apps for business.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Those are very valuable.
But now we're getting into
just a new generation of folks.
I think a couple, a decade or two ago,
founders were most inspired by Steve Jobs,
and today, you know, that
sort of figure is Elon Musk,
and he is encouraging people
to think enormously big,
and to literally, you know,
go for the planets and the stars.
The other thing that gives me hope
is I do see the tide turning
intellectually and ideologically.
There's a new progress movement starting,
and I'm seeing a lot of energy around it.
There are a lot of people
who are looking around
and saying, yeah, we made a mistake.
We threw the baby out with the bath water.
We got so concerned about the
costs and risks of progress,
and we allowed that to cause us
to slow down progress itself.
And that was a mistake.
Humanity has not reached its peak.
I think there is much
more progress to be made.
Not only that, I think
that we should expect
not stagnation in the
future, but acceleration,
especially with the advent
of artificial intelligence.
I expect future growth rates to be
only higher and higher
even despite a relative
slowdown in progress
in the last 50 years or so.
The most important thing
I believe about the future
is that the future can be as well off
relative to the present
as the present is compared to the past.
In 1800, the vast majority of the world
lived in extreme poverty.
Today, only a small fraction does.
We've come such a very long way.
We've more than doubled
world life expectancy at birth.
We are so much better compared to
those people a couple hundred years ago.
And yet, if you ask the
average person back then,
they didn't think that they
were living in extreme poverty.
They thought it was normal
because it was normal.
We don't think that we're
living in extreme poverty today,
but I think that 200 years from now,
the future could be so
amazing if we create it,
that those future people will
look back on us and saying,
"I cannot believe they lived that way."
Everything seems normal
when you're living through it, right?
Not having a refrigerator seems normal
when nobody has one.
Not having electricity seems
normal when nobody has one.
Not having a toilet or indoor plumbing
seems normal when nobody has it.
But today, any of those
things would be considered
absolutely subpar living standards, right?
Inhuman, inhumane,
inhospitable living standards
to not have running water and electricity
and refrigeration and light bulbs.
So, these things that
start off as luxuries
become absolute necessities.
And I think we can blind ourselves,
we can be blind to the
potential progress of the future
by not thinking about that,
by looking around and saying,
"Well, hey, things are okay.
I'm pretty comfortable.
What more progress is there
to be made after all?"
And yet, as long as anybody anywhere
is worrying about their electricity bill,
or their air conditioning bill,
or their water bill, or any kind of,
you know, has any kind
of monetary problem,
there's more progress to be made.
As long as anyone anywhere
is dying of cancer
or heart disease or
Alzheimer's or anything,
there is more progress to be made.
As long as, you know,
people are separated by distance
and can't get together and
see each other or congregate
anytime and anywhere that they want,
there is more progress to be made.
As long as any child is not getting
the best possible education that the world
could possibly offer them,
there is more progress to be made.
And so there are so many things that we
could invent in the future,
or are inventing right now.
Artificial intelligence, genetic
engineering, fusion energy,
going back to space and
creating a real space economy
and settling the moon and the planets,
and one day the stars,
all of these things, once we have them,
we will consider them
absolutely essential,
even if today they seem
like science fiction.
And I think people are looking for,
I think they're hungry for a
new philosophy of progress,
a new ideology that says that,
yeah, actually, technology, science,
industry, economic growth,
all of these things can be
and fundamentally are massively
beneficial for human life.
As long as we're thoughtful
about them and careful,
as long as we steer them properly,
this can lead us into
a new age of humanity.
This can ultimately take us to the stars,
and that's where we're going.
