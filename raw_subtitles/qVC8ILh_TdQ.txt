 A
 child
 with
 ADHD
 will


receive
 an
 estimated
 20,000
 corrective


or
 negative
 messages
 by
 age
 10.
 This


according
 to
 William
 Dodson,
 a
 noted


psychiatrist.
 Historically,
 ADHD
 has


been
 seen
 as
 a
 disorder
 that
 affects


[music]
 primarily
 boys.
 Girls
 have
 been


largely
 ignored.
 Consider
 that
 while
 the


symptoms
 of
 ADHD
 were
 first
 identified


back
 in
 1798,


it
 wasn't
 until
 the
 1990s
 that
 science


began
 to
 study
 [music]
 how
 ADHD
 presents


in
 girls,
 and
 how
 it
 might
 be
 affecting


them.
 ADHD
 was
 formally
 recognized
 as
 a


mental
 disorder
 by
 the
 [music]
 American


Psychiatric
 Association,
 the
 APA,
 in
 the


1960s,
 and
 back
 then
 it
 was
 called
 a


quote
 hyperinetic
 reaction
 of
 childhood.


It
 would
 later
 be
 called
 ADD
 or


attention
 deficit
 disorder.
 In
 1987,
 the


APA
 changed
 the
 name
 to
 ADHD
 or


attention
 deficit
 hyperactivity


disorder.
 Then
 in
 2013,
 the
 APA


reclassified
 it
 as
 a


neurodedevelopmental
 disorder
 with
 three


presentations,


primarily
 hyperactive
 and
 impulsive,


primarily
 inattentive,
 and
 a
 combination


of
 the
 two.
 In
 the
 little
 time
 ADHD
 has


been
 studied
 in
 girls,
 researchers
 have


discovered
 many
 differences
 in
 how
 it


presents
 compared
 to
 boys.
 The
 signs


that
 we
 mostly
 associate
 with
 ADHD,


hyperactivity,
 and
 impulsive
 behaviors


are
 ones
 that
 usually
 impact
 boys.
 In


girls,
 it's
 often
 the
 second
 subset,
 an


internal
 presentation.
 Daydreaming,


self-lame,
 masking,
 and
 disassociation.


when
 they
 were
 younger.
 Girls
 with
 ADHD


tend
 to
 do
 well
 in
 school.
 So
 often


teachers
 don't
 think
 there
 is
 anything


wrong.
 But
 many
 mask
 or
 hide
 their


symptoms
 to
 fit
 in
 with
 their
 peers.
 And


if
 they're
 unable
 to
 be
 organized
 or


struggle
 in
 class,
 it
 is
 seen
 as
 a


personal
 failing.


Experts
 say
 ADHD
 is
 just
 as
 prevalent


with
 girls
 as
 it
 is
 with
 boys.
 but
 girls


are
 underdiagnosed


and
 that
 quote
 boys
 and
 men
 are
 more


likely
 than
 girls
 and
 women
 to
 be


referred
 for
 services
 even
 when
 their


symptom
 profiles
 are
 exactly
 the
 same.


Until
 1999,
 81%
 of
 ADHD
 studies
 were
 on


men.
 So
 it
 is
 easy
 to
 see
 how
 ADHD


presentation
 in
 women
 was
 not
 recognized


or
 understood.
 But
 in
 the
 1990s,
 Dr.


Steven
 Henshaw
 led
 groundbreaking


research
 on
 how
 ADHD
 impacts
 girls
 and


the
 study
 has
 become
 known
 as
 the
 Be


Gals
 or
 Berkeley
 Girls
 Study.
 The
 Be


Gals
 study
 was
 a
 milestone
 and
 helped
 to


establish
 ADHD
 as
 a
 serious
 condition


for
 women
 and
 girls.
 In
 an
 interview
 on


the
 podcast
 Hyperfocus
 with
 Ray


Jacobson,
 Dr.
 Henshaw
 said
 this.
 For
 way


too
 long,
 clinicians
 have
 thought,


"Well,
 it
 must
 be
 depression
 and
 anxiety


that
 goes
 along
 with
 being
 female.
 ADHD


is
 a
 guy
 thing."
 Dr.
 Henshaw
 explained


that
 undiagnosed
 ADHD
 in
 girls
 can
 have


quote
 devastating
 consequences.
 The
 Beal


study
 found
 that
 girls
 with
 the
 combined


type
 of
 ADHD
 were
 at
 a
 higher
 risk
 of


selfharming
 or
 attempting
 suicide.


Studies
 have
 also
 found
 that
 girls
 with


ADHD
 were
 at
 higher
 risk
 of
 unplanned


pregnancies,
 more
 likely
 to
 experience


dating
 violence
 and
 intimate
 partner


violence.
 Teens
 with
 ADHD
 are
 more


likely
 to
 become
 pregnant,
 and
 quote,


are
 more
 likely
 to
 exhibit
 riskier


sexual
 behaviors.
 Women
 with
 ADHD
 also


suffer
 from
 depression,
 low
 self-esteem,


sleep
 disorders,
 and
 fibromyalgia.


A
 study
 published
 in
 the
 British
 Journal


of
 Psychiatry
 in
 January
 2025,
 found


that
 women
 with
 ADHD
 have
 a
 shorter


lifespan,
 9
 years
 shorter
 than
 women


without.
 On
 today's
 episode,
 we
 speak
 to


writer
 Carla
 Chiconei,
 who
 became
 one
 of


the
 growing
 numbers
 of
 women
 to
 be


diagnosed
 with
 ADHD
 during
 the
 pandemic.


We
 speak
 to
 her
 about
 the
 quote
 female


[music]
 protective
 effect,
 the


challenges
 she
 felt
 in
 school
 as
 a
 young


child,
 [music]
 and
 why
 she
 wrote
 the


book
 Nowhere
 Girl:
 Life
 as
 a
 member
 of


ADHD's
 Lost
 Generation.
 She
 joins
 me


now.


>> Welcome
 to
 the
 podcast.
 It's
 so
 nice
 to


have
 you
 here.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


>> Oh,
 can
 I
 just
 say
 your
 book
 is
 just


like
 breathtaking.
 Um,
 you
 talk
 about
 so


many
 different
 things
 and
 uh,
 as
 I
 said


to
 you
 before
 we
 started
 recording,
 we


go
 where
 you're
 comfortable.


>> Okay.


>> Okay.
 Um,
 but
 first
 off,
 who
 are
 the


Nowhere
 girls?


>> Oh,
 well,
 we
 are
 a
 group
 of
 women
 and


girls
 who
 were
 kind
 of
 left
 out
 of


scientific
 research
 for
 a
 really
 long


time
 and
 um,
 learned
 a
 little
 bit
 too


late
 that
 our
 brains
 operate
 differently


and
 that
 so
 much
 of
 what
 we
 blamed


ourselves
 for
 in
 our
 life
 isn't


necessarily
 our
 fault.
 It's
 because
 we


have
 ADHD
 or
 autism
 or
 other
 neurode


divergence.
 So,


>> and
 science
 just
 forgot
 to
 include
 you.


[laughter]


>> We'll
 talk
 more
 about
 The
 Nowhere
 Girls,


but
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 first.
 Um,


this
 is
 a
 memoir,
 but
 it's
 also
 you've


done
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 studies
 and
 historical


research
 on
 it.
 Yeah,
 we'll
 come
 we'll


get
 back
 to
 that
 in
 just
 a
 second.
 Um,


but
 during
 COVID
 lockdowns,
 remember


that
 time?
 It's
 so
 much
 fun.


>> It
 feels
 like
 a
 [laughter]
 dream
 now.


Like
 a
 nightmare,


>> right?
 It's
 just
 like
 I
 look
 back,
 I'm


like,
 "Oh,
 that's
 why
 everything's
 the


way
 it
 is
 now."
 Um,
 [laughter]


>> it
 didn't
 recover.


>> We
 did
 not
 recover.
 It
 broke
 everything.


[gasps]
 But,
 um,
 during
 COVID,
 at
 age


39,
 um,
 you're
 a
 mother
 to
 a
 toddler.


You
 were
 officially
 diagnosed
 with
 ADHD.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 were
 also
 diagnosed
 with
 depression,


generalized
 anxiety
 disorder
 or
 GAD,
 and


perfectionism.


>> Yes.


>> After
 the
 diagnosis,
 you
 write
 that


quote,
 "You
 found
 it
 impossible
 to
 talk


about
 ADHD
 at
 first.
 How
 come?"
 I
 think


because
 I
 had
 the
 stereotype
 of
 ADHD
 of


being
 a
 little
 boy's
 disorder
 and


>> and
 like
 hyper
 and


>> hyperactive
 and
 disruptive
 and
 kind
 of


like
 not
 the
 kind
 of
 kid
 I
 wanted
 to
 be


associated
 with
 when
 I
 was
 in
 school.


And
 so
 I
 think
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 shame
 just


from
 my
 misperception
 of
 what
 ADHD
 was.


I
 also


I
 also
 was
 hanging
 out
 with
 mostly
 my


family
 members
 at
 the
 time
 who
 who


weren't
 on
 the
 same
 journey
 as
 me,


right?
 They
 weren't
 researching
 ADHD.


They
 weren't
 overly
 concerned
 with


mental
 health
 and
 what
 was
 going
 on.
 So,


I
 wasn't
 comfortable
 talking
 to
 them


about
 it
 because
 they
 kind
 of,
 oh
 yeah,


everybody
 has
 that.
 Like,
 I
 got
 those


kind
 of
 responses.
 So,
 it
 was
 something


that
 was
 I
 just
 went
 through
 on
 my
 own.


So,
 it
 it's
 interesting
 because
 um
 you


do
 write
 about
 your
 family
 and
 how
 you


grew
 up.
 So,
 the
 back
 of
 your
 mind,
 you


were
 worried
 about
 the
 stigma
 attached


to
 you
 having
 ADHD,
 but
 not
 it
 not
 being


an
 answer
 to
 maybe
 the
 way
 that
 you


were,
 but
 something
 that
 made
 you
 even


more
 different.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 so.
 And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


there's
 there's
 nothing
 worse
 than


trying
 to
 have
 open
 and
 honest


conversations
 about
 mental
 health
 with


somebody
 who
 doesn't
 isn't
 ready
 to
 or


doesn't
 want
 to
 hear
 it
 or
 isn't
 on
 the


same
 page
 as
 you.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 um
 I


kept
 a
 lot
 to
 myself
 because
 the
 people


I
 was
 around
 weren't
 weren't
 on
 the
 same


page.


>> One
 of
 the
 diagnoses
 that
 you
 received


was
 perfectionism.
 and
 you
 write
 this.


While
 I
 was
 grateful
 for
 the
 diagnosis,


both
 the
 ones
 I
 was
 expecting
 and
 the


ones
 that
 surprised
 me,
 I
 was
 also


bothered
 by
 them,
 mostly
 because
 they


provided
 reasons
 for
 why
 I
 was


struggling
 so
 hard,
 but
 they
 didn't


offer
 a
 way
 out.
 Yeah.


>> What
 did
 you
 mean
 by
 this?


Well,
 I
 mean,
 when
 you
 get
 a
 diagnosis,


I
 got
 a
 prescription
 for
 stimulant


medication,
 but
 I
 didn't
 get
 a
 a


handbook
 on
 how
 to
 live
 your
 life
 with


these
 four
 disorders
 that
 you
 just
 got


diagnosed
 with.
 So,
 again,
 it
 was
 kind


of
 a
 lonely
 process
 for
 me.
 So,
 I
 got
 on


the
 stimulant
 medication,
 which
 made
 my


dayto-day
 a
 bit
 easier.
 But
 for
 me,
 I


had
 to
 go
 back
 and
 unpack


sort
 of
 the
 story
 I'd
 been
 telling


myself
 about
 my
 life
 and
 that
 took
 a
 lot


of
 time
 and
 it
 and
 therapy.


>> Well,
 you
 write
 about
 a
 childhood
 where


you
 were
 different


>> and
 you
 felt
 like
 you
 were
 to
 blame
 for


that
 difference.


>> Uh
 you
 were
 called
 lazy.
 Uh
 you
 did
 well


in
 school
 until
 you
 didn't.


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]


>> You
 had
 a
 hard
 time
 making
 friends
 and


feeling
 secure
 uh
 in
 those


relationships.
 But
 you're
 right,
 my


relationship
 to
 mental
 illness
 was


complicated
 and
 in
 line
 with
 someone
 who


grew
 up
 in
 a
 workingclass
 first
 uh


generation
 family.


>> I
 looked
 at
 it
 the
 same
 way
 I
 did
 those


who
 put
 pineapple
 and
 pizza
 with


intrigue
 and
 distrust.
 I
 actually
 like


pineapple
 [laughter]
 pizza.


>> It's
 okay.
 This
 is
 a
 safe
 space.


>> This
 is
 a
 safe
 space.
 But
 like
 I
 I'm


just
 cuz
 I'm
 when
 I
 was
 reading
 it,
 I


was
 rooting
 for
 you
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 like


maybe
 you
 felt
 all
 these
 things,
 but


maybe
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 felt,
 okay,
 it


wasn't
 me.


>> Yeah.


>> Something
 else
 was
 going
 on.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 a
 sense
 of
 relief,
 but
 you
 felt


angry,
 stressed.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 complicated
 when
 you


get
 diagnosed
 so
 late
 with
 something


that
 you
 have
 had
 all
 your
 life.
 Um,


[clears throat]
 I
 felt
 I
 I
 felt
 all


those
 things.
 angry,
 frustrated,


um,
 and
 also
 just
 sort
 of
 unseen,
 right?


Because
 I,


so
 much
 of
 what
 I
 went
 through,
 um,
 was


blamed
 on
 personality
 defects,
 like
 you


mentioned,
 like
 you're
 lazy
 or
 you're,


you
 know,
 you're
 flighty
 or
 you're
 not
 a


serious
 person
 or
 whatever.
 So,


>> how
 did
 ADHD
 show
 up
 in
 your
 life?
 Well,


at
 the
 time
 it
 it
 showed
 up
 in
 parent
 in


my
 parenting.
 So,
 it
 was
 my
 main
 way
 of


motivating
 myself
 was
 always
 to
 be


really
 mean
 to
 myself
 to
 sort
 of
 spur


myself
 into
 to
 action
 to
 get
 the
 things


done
 because
 with
 ADHD
 you
 lack


executive
 function.
 So,
 the
 little


things
 that
 like
 make
 your
 day
 easier,


we
 don't
 we
 don't
 naturally
 do
 those


things


>> like
 getting
 up
 on
 time.
 getting
 up
 on


time
 or
 just
 like
 planning
 your
 day,


like
 knowing
 what
 to
 prioritize
 in
 your


day,
 knowing
 the
 things
 you
 need
 to
 do


and
 like
 the
 right
 order
 to
 do
 them
 in.


Um,
 often
 what
 I
 will
 do
 is
 get
 sort
 of


like
 paralyzed
 with
 fear
 about
 doing


those
 things
 and
 then
 not
 do
 any
 of


them.


>> So,
 which
 makes
 everything
 worse.


>> It
 makes
 everything
 worse
 and
 then
 you


panic
 and
 then
 you
 you
 do
 it
 in
 a
 rush


at
 the
 end.
 Sometimes
 it
 works
 out


because
 we
 have
 the
 ability
 to


hyperfocus
 when
 when
 we
 really
 need
 to.


And
 so
 like
 if
 I
 have
 a
 big
 deadline
 and


I'm
 almost
 missing
 it,
 like
 I
 can
 pull


an
 allnighter
 and
 like
 and
 do
 it.
 I
 mean


less
 now
 because
 I'm
 old
 and
 [laughter]


child
 but
 like
 I
 humbled
 my
 age.


[gasps]


>> Yes.
 But
 I
 could.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 so
 those


those
 little
 things
 um
 they
 really
 add


up
 and
 so
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 older
 you
 get,


the
 more
 that
 it
 is
 more
 apparent
 how


behind
 you
 are
 in
 those
 things
 because


doing
 adult
 life
 is
 just
 so
 much
 harder


for
 you,
 right?


>> And
 I
 guess
 too
 cuz
 I'm
 noticing
 online


um
 a
 lot
 of
 moms
 are
 finding
 out
 that


they're
 like,
 "Oh,
 maybe
 I
 have
 ADHD."


>> Yeah.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 that
 is?


>> Well,
 it's
 interesting
 because
 Yeah.


when
 anytime
 there's
 like
 a
 big
 hormonal


disrupt
 like
 when
 puberty
 or
 after
 you


have
 a
 baby
 or
 in
 pmenopause
 or


menopause
 your
 estrogen
 which
 has
 like
 a


protective
 effect
 on
 your
 brain
 is


dipping
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 what


we're
 seeing
 like
 when
 when
 there's
 a


new
 mom
 and
 she's
 like
 you
 know
 her
 life


is
 a
 mess
 and
 she's
 like
 oh
 do
 I
 have


ADHD
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 huge
 hormonal


equation
 there


>> I
 want
 to
 come
 back
 to
 that
 uh
 in
 a
 it


when
 we
 talk
 about
 medication.
 Yes.
 Uh


but
 uh
 you
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 for
 the


book,
 it's
 memoir,
 but
 it's
 also
 the


history
 of
 how
 girls
 were
 not
 even


considered
 to
 have
 ADHD.


>> Uh
 who
 is
 Steven
 Henshaw?


>> I
 love
 Steven
 Henshaw.
 Um
 he's
 a


professor
 at
 the
 University
 of


California,
 Berkeley,
 and
 he
 was
 the


first
 researcher
 to
 look
 at
 girls
 with


ADHD
 in
 the
 '9s.
 So
 he
 did
 a
 study


called
 be
 gals
 and
 it
 was
 a
 study
 that


looked
 at
 I
 think
 sixy
 olds
 to
 13y
 olds


and
 he's
 followed
 them
 since
 that
 time.


So
 now
 they're
 like
 40
 in
 their
 40s
 and


50s
 I
 think.
 Um,
 and
 so
 they
 give


they're
 they're
 the
 first
 longitudinal


study
 we
 have
 of
 women
 with
 ADHD
 that


and
 so
 in
 their
 lives
 we
 can
 see
 a
 lot


of
 the
 trends
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the


>> commonalities
 between
 us
 all.


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 it's
 amazing
 that
 he
 um
 did


that
 because
 at
 the
 time
 it
 wasn't
 even


part
 of
 the
 conversation.
 So
 what
 did
 he


find
 about
 ADHD
 and
 how
 it
 impacts


girls?


So
 he
 found
 that
 it's
 it's
 a
 more


internal
 experience
 and
 um
 what
 happens


is
 when
 puberty
 hits
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 if
 it


hasn't
 been
 identified
 it
 turns
 into


anxiety
 and
 depression.
 And
 so
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 misdiagnosing
 girls
 in
 that
 age


group
 because
 the
 hor
 hormones
 take
 over


and
 depression
 takes
 hold
 and
 that's


what
 gets
 identified
 first.
 And
 when
 you


when
 you
 say
 internal
 um
 I
 guess
 when
 we


have
 a
 what
 we
 think
 is
 ADHD
 we
 have
 the


image
 of
 the
 boy
 who's
 really
 hyper


disruptive
 in
 class
 but
 for
 girls
 it's


more
 something
 that's
 happening
 inside


them.


>> Yeah.
 So
 it's
 kind
 of
 that
 same


hyperactivity.
 So
 it's
 called


inattentive
 ADHD
 this
 type
 and
 and
 men


can
 have
 it
 too.
 It's
 not
 just
 girls
 but


it's
 predominantly
 girls
 that
 get
 it.
 Um


and
 it
 is
 that
 hyperactivity
 sort
 of


turned
 inward.
 So,
 it's
 a
 lot
 of


daydreaming,
 like
 listening
 in
 class,


but
 not
 actually
 hearing
 what
 the


teacher
 is
 saying.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of
 like


forgetting
 your
 homework
 and
 doing
 it
 at


the
 last
 minute,
 but
 still
 doing
 it.
 So,


nobody's
 noticing
 that
 you
 are


struggling
 with
 anything
 really
 because


it's
 all
 happening
 within
 you.


>> Rumination
 maybe
 like,


>> oh
 yeah,
 rumination
 big
 time.
 So
 you


>> yeah
 because
 you
 have
 [laughter]
 you


have
 that
 emotional
 dysregulation
 piece


of
 you
 know
 we
 get
 these
 really
 big


feelings
 and
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 manage


them
 and
 that
 combined
 with
 all
 the


other
 stuff
 is
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 it
 it


turns
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 low
 self-esteem.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 write
 about
 masking
 self-lame
 and


then
 in
 school
 especially
 in
 the
 early


years
 might
 do
 well
 in
 school
 and
 I


actually
 often
 consider
 to
 be
 gifted.


>> Yes.
 But
 in
 schools,
 there
 isn't
 a


masking
 screening
 tool
 for
 ADHD.
 And
 the


current
 screening
 and
 diagnostic
 tools


for
 ADHD
 were
 based
 on
 research
 that
 was


done
 on
 boys.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 does
 this
 harm
 young
 girls
 who
 have


ADHD
 and
 are
 struggling
 internally?
 I


think
 that
 that's
 like
 the
 biggest


contributor
 to
 to
 the
 low
 self-esteem


that
 we
 see
 in
 girls
 with
 ADHD
 is
 that


it's
 such
 a
 lonely
 experience.
 And


whether
 they
 get
 a
 like
 a
 good
 school


experience
 or
 not
 is
 fully
 dependent
 on


if
 their
 teacher
 understands
 ADHD
 and


can
 identify
 it
 in
 a
 kid
 that
 maybe


hasn't
 been
 diagnosed,
 which
 is
 a
 huge


task
 for
 a
 teacher.
 And
 you
 need
 a
 very


caring
 and
 astute
 teacher
 to
 even
 be


able
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 then
 you
 might
 have


a
 teacher
 like
 that
 one
 year
 and
 then


have
 a
 teacher
 that's
 completely
 not


understanding.


>> So
 it's
 up
 and
 down
 for
 the
 student.


>> And
 I
 think
 like
 my
 experience
 was
 like


that
 too.
 Like
 some
 years
 I
 had
 more


understanding
 teachers
 that,
 you
 know,


knew
 how
 to
 connect
 with
 me
 and
 my


interests
 and
 kind
 of
 like
 encourage
 me.


And
 some
 years
 it
 was
 the
 complete


opposite.
 So
 um
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 um


different
 things
 that
 you
 wrote
 about
 in


the
 book
 that
 just
 broke
 my
 heart,
 took


my
 breath
 away.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 um
 you


cited
 a
 study
 that
 showed
 that
 quote,


"It's
 estimated
 that
 a
 child
 with
 ADHD


receives
 20,000
 more
 corrective
 or


negative
 messages
 by
 age
 10
 and
 their


self-esteem
 suffers
 as
 a
 result."


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 as
 a
 mother
 now
 and
 looking
 back
 on


your
 own
 childhood,
 you
 think
 what?


>> Oh,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 can
 feel
 the
 effects
 of


the
 20,000.
 [laughter]
 I
 felt
 like
 I


felt
 them
 when
 I
 was
 young
 and
 I
 can


still
 feel
 them.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 I
 mean


that's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 I


wanted
 to
 write
 this
 book
 and
 to
 sort
 of


change
 the
 way
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 myself


and
 parenting
 myself
 because
 I
 knew
 I


had
 this
 job
 of
 parenting
 a
 little
 girl


and
 who
 was
 a
 lot
 like
 me.
 And
 so
 I


could
 It's
 so
 weird
 when
 you
 become
 a


parent,
 you
 kind
 of
 hear
 the
 automatic


reactions
 of
 your
 own
 parents
 and
 it


comes
 so
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 you're
 like,


"Wait,
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 I
 didn't
 want
 to


talk
 to
 you
 like
 that.
 Where
 did
 that


come
 from?"
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 the
 idea


that
 I
 needed
 to
 change
 that
 and
 like


learn
 a
 different
 way
 of
 parenting
 her,


um,
 it
 was
 huge
 for
 me.


>> And
 it's
 hard.


>> It's
 so
 hard


>> because
 it's
 like
 you
 feel
 it
 because


you
 experienced
 those
 things.
 You
 want


to
 protect
 them
 from
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 then
 the
 way
 you
 were
 parented
 was


in
 an
 environment
 where
 no
 one


understood
 what
 was
 going
 on
 with
 you.


>> Of
 course.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 so
 having


this
 awareness,
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily


make
 it
 easier.
 [laughter]


>> You
 probably
 are
 harder
 on
 yourself.


Yeah.
 Right.


>> Yeah.
 It
 is
 another
 reason
 to
 be
 hard
 on


yourself.
 So
 it
 is
 a
 slippery
 slope


there.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of


women,
 you
 know,
 especially
 on
 social


media,
 you
 know,
 being
 like,
 I
 need
 to


parent
 gentle
 and
 I
 these
 are
 the
 things


I
 need
 to
 do
 to
 be
 a
 good
 mom.
 And
 a
 a


part
 of
 that
 is
 great
 and
 I'm
 glad


people
 are
 thinking
 that
 way,
 but
 also


it
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 like
 the
 next
 avenue


that
 women
 are
 being
 hard
 on
 ourselves


for
 is
 like
 just
 overanalyzing
 our


parenting
 and
 fixating
 on
 it.


>> Yeah,
 kids
 [laughter]
 are
 very
 humbling.


>> Yeah.


>> In
 so
 many
 ways.


Um,
 so
 in
 writing
 in
 this
 book,
 you
 did


a
 survey
 with
 the
 Nowhere
 Girls
 and
 you


write
 that
 quote,
 "A
 staggering
 90%
 of


nowhere
 girls
 who
 answered
 my
 question


about
 childhood
 trauma
 said
 they


experienced
 it."
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 did
 that
 [clears throat]
 shock
 you?


>> It
 was
 It
 saddened
 me,
 but
 it
 didn't


shock
 me
 because
 I
 mean
 my
 own
 story
 was


full
 of
 childhood
 trauma
 and
 from


speaking
 with
 Dr.
 Henshaw,
 I
 kind
 of


knew
 that
 the
 girls
 he
 had
 studied
 also


had
 a
 higher
 rates
 of
 childhood
 trauma


and
 substance
 use
 and
 [gasps]
 all
 of


that.
 So
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 expecting
 it.
 But


>> can
 you
 explain
 that
 a
 bit
 more?
 So
 is


it
 genetic
 or
 is
 it
 if
 something
 happens


to
 you
 like
 epigenetic?


>> So
 it
 it
 is
 genetic.
 It's
 heritable.
 So


80%.
 So
 it's
 like
 if
 your
 if
 your


parents
 had
 it,
 you
 have
 80%
 chance
 of


also
 getting
 it.
 But
 yes,
 the


epigenetics,
 the
 environment
 that
 you


grew
 up
 in,
 if
 it
 was
 calm
 and
 peaceful


and
 organized
 and,
 you
 know,
 praised
 you


for
 the
 right
 reasons,
 you
 might
 not


develop
 ADHD
 for
 a
 long
 time
 or
 might


not
 show
 the
 symptoms
 of
 it.
 And
 maybe


it'll
 take
 you
 until
 like
 you
 become
 a


mother
 and
 you're
 like,
 oh,
 like


everything
 that
 I
 had
 in
 place
 has


fallen
 away
 and
 that's
 when
 you
 start


expressing
 symptoms
 of
 ADHD.


>> But
 there
 is
 something
 called
 the
 female


protective
 effect.


>> What's
 that?
 So
 it's
 um
 because
 women


have
 I
 think
 extra
 responsibilities
 on


them
 from
 when
 they're
 quite
 young
 and


we
 learn
 how
 to
 sort
 of
 mask
 and
 our


lives
 are
 kind
 of
 set
 up
 in
 a
 way
 that


protects
 us
 from
 everything
 falling
 away


and
 and
 the
 ADHD
 symptoms
 taking
 over.


Um
 that's
 why
 sometimes
 it
 takes
 longer.


>> You
 write
 about
 masking
 more
 in
 the


book.
 Can
 you
 explain
 what
 that
 is?


Yeah.
 So
 masking
 is
 I
 mean
 it
 kind
 of
 is


a
 way
 of


um
 putting
 on
 a
 mask
 so
 that
 you
 can


blend
 in
 in
 your
 life
 and
 also
 just
 like


achieve
 what
 you
 need
 to
 achieve


throughout
 the
 day.
 Like
 I
 was
 talking


about
 executive
 dysfunction
 earlier
 and


a
 lot
 of
 people
 use
 masking
 to
 just
 get


through
 the
 tasks
 of
 the
 day
 and
 I
 used


to
 do
 that
 by
 being
 mean
 to
 myself
 and


motivating
 myself
 by
 being
 like
 come
 on


you
 can
 do
 this.
 It's
 also
 a
 a
 huge
 part


of
 masking
 is
 getting
 along
 socially
 and


um
 blending
 into
 different
 groups
 and


[snorts]
 in
 school
 I
 kind
 of
 like


collected
 traits
 from
 from
 my
 friends


that
 I
 thought
 were
 like
 doing
 doing
 it


well
 [laughter]


and
 then
 just
 sort
 of
 tried
 them
 on
 for


size
 and
 I
 think
 I
 still
 carry
 some
 of


that
 with
 me
 now.
 Right.


>> Uh
 because
 your
 mom
 meant
 like
 when


you're
 in
 the
 book
 you
 write
 about
 how


your
 mom
 picked
 up
 on
 that.


>> Yes.
 that
 you
 would
 um
 within
 certain


friendships
 that
 you
 had,
 you
 started


being
 more
 like
 that
 person.
 You
 said


that
 ADHD
 you
 inherited
 like
 80%.


>> So
 now
 that
 you
 know
 you
 have
 it


>> Yeah.


>> and
 you
 look
 back
 on
 your
 own
 family


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 does
 everything
 make
 sense.


>> Oh
 [laughter]
 yeah.


>> Very
 chaotic.
 Um
 yes
 it
 does
 make
 sense.


And
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 have
 an
 aunt
 on
 my


dad's
 side
 who
 was
 diagnosed
 when
 she


was
 55.
 So,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 easier
 to


point
 to
 that
 side
 of
 the
 family's
 genes


as
 um
 where
 it's
 coming
 from.
 But
 just


yeah,
 the
 but
 it's
 it's
 hard
 because


we're
 also
 Italian.
 So,
 like
 the


loudness,
 the
 talking
 over
 each
 other,


the
 interrupting,
 it's
 like,
 do
 we
 have


ADHD
 or
 are
 [laughter]
 we
 just
 Italian?


>> [gasps]


>> So
 you
 could
 see
 why
 it
 might
 might
 take


us
 longer
 to
 get
 diagnosed.
 [laughter]


>> Have
 you
 had
 conversations
 with
 your


family
 since
 you
 had
 ADHD?


>> Yes.
 And
 you
 know
 um
 my
 aunt
 who
 I


mentioned,
 she's
 she's
 very
 into
 like


the
 ADHD
 education
 and
 and
 learning
 more


and
 we've
 had
 some
 really
 good


conversations.
 Um
 my
 parents
 aren't
 as
 I


think
 they're
 interested
 in
 it,
 but
 it's


more
 just
 like
 I
 think
 they
 still
 think


of
 it
 as
 a
 bit
 of
 an
 excuse.
 And
 it's


really
 hard
 to
 get
 out
 of
 that
 mindset


of
 like,
 you
 know,
 viewing
 mental
 health


issues
 as
 weakness.


>> Um,
 so
 it
 is
 harder
 to
 talk
 to
 them


about
 about
 ADHD.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 can
 I


can
 empathize
 with
 them
 because
 I


understand
 where
 that
 came
 from.
 But


yeah,
 it's
 it's
 hard
 to
 not
 be
 able
 to.


>> That's
 another
 thing
 like
 once
 you


become
 a
 parent,
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 um
 I


didn't
 have
 the
 best
 relationships
 with


my
 parents.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 since
 I
 had
 kids,
 I
 understand
 them


more.


>> Yeah.


>> Um


>> you
 can
 understand
 how
 how
 they
 develop


and
 why
 they
 were
 the
 way
 they
 were.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 I
 show
 them
 more
 grace.


>> Um
 you
 write
 in
 the
 book
 too
 that
 uh


quote
 being
 diagnosed
 with
 depression


and
 anxiety
 or
 misdiagnosed
 with
 a
 mood


disorder
 long
 before
 ADHD
 is
 so


customary
 among
 women.
 It's
 basically
 a


right
 of
 passage.
 And
 quote,
 "To
 me
 the


most
 shocking
 misdiagnosis
 for
 women


with
 ADHD
 is
 also
 one
 of
 the
 most
 common


uh
 bipolar
 2
 disorder
 or
 BD."


>> Yeah.


>> Why
 is
 that?


>> Well,
 so
 with
 bipolar
 disorder,
 you
 get


um
 like
 manic
 episodes
 and
 then


depressive
 episodes.
 And
 so
 if
 ADHD


doesn't
 get
 identified
 early
 and
 these


patterns
 sort
 of
 take
 hold,
 I
 could
 see


why
 you
 might
 get
 misdiagnosed
 with
 this


because
 your
 hyperfocusing
 and
 your


enthusiasm
 and
 your
 impulsivity
 might
 be


misread
 as
 mania.
 But
 the
 difference
 is


um
 with
 a
 bipolar
 you
 that
 starts
 in
 um


adolescence.
 So
 the
 episodes
 start
 in


adolescence
 whereas
 ADHD
 it
 starts
 long


before
 then
 which
 is
 why
 it's
 really


important
 to
 get
 a
 thorough
 assessment


to
 figure
 out
 like
 what's
 going
 on
 cuz


I've
 had
 friends
 who
 were
 misdiagnosed


with
 bipolar
 and
 on
 the
 wrong
 medication


for
 like
 10
 years
 and


>> that
 causes
 a
 lot
 of
 harm,
 doesn't
 it?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 but
 I
 can
 also
 see
 why


that's
 happening
 because
 historically


women,
 if
 you
 haven't
 considered
 that


women
 and
 girls
 have
 ADHD,


>> Yeah.


>> you
 won't
 put
 them
 in
 that
 category.
 You


won't
 even
 consider
 it.


>> So,
 the
 other
 bipolar
 is
 like
 thought
 of


more
 as
 like
 a
 women's
 disorder.


>> And
 why
 is
 that,
 Carla?
 [laughter]


>> Because
 sexism.


>> We're
 laughing,
 but


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 the
 history
 of
 women's


mental
 health
 is
 like
 not


>> It's
 hysteria,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 hysteria.
 That's
 where
 it


comes
 from.
 And
 you
 know,
 what
 they
 were


willing
 to
 diagnose
 women
 with
 were
 the


hysterical


diagnosis
 versus,
 you
 know,
 the
 more


typical
 male
 diagnosis
 of
 like
 autism
 or


ADHD.
 They
 they
 didn't
 even
 think
 of


that.
 So,
 which
 also
 I
 can
 see
 why


families
 might
 want
 to
 shy
 away
 from
 a


diagnosis
 like
 ADHD
 because
 of
 that


stigma,
 too,


>> right?
 So
 the
 harm
 just
 kind
 of
 dominal


effect.


>> Yeah,
 for
 sure.


>> Um,
 what
 other
 conditions
 are
 women
 with


ADHD
 likely
 to
 have?


>> Oh,
 so
 many.
 Um,
 I
 mean
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 are


hyper
 mobile,
 so
 meaning
 like
 our
 joints


bend
 more
 easily,
 but
 also
 we
 have
 more


pain
 in
 our
 bodies
 because
 of
 that.
 And


um,
 that's
 something
 I
 didn't
 even
 know


about
 until
 I
 went
 to
 this
 like


physiootherapist
 who
 told
 me
 about
 it.


Um,
 but
 there's
 more
 depression
 and


anxiety
 as
 you
 mentioned.
 Um,
 even


things
 like
 eczema
 and
 asthma
 and


diabetes,


>> stutters
 too.


>> Yeah,
 stutters,
 ticks,
 all
 sorts
 of
 like


basically
 [laughter]
 everything
 you
 can


think
 of
 is
 more
 common
 in
 this


population.
 Um,
 you're
 right
 that
 there


is
 also
 quote
 emerging
 evidence
 that


some
 girls
 with
 anorexia
 may
 in
 fact
 be


suffering
 from
 autism,
 but
 because
 it's


not
 a
 typical
 male
 symptom,
 it's
 been


missed.
 Similar
 studies
 exist
 for
 ADHD,


but
 the
 pool
 of
 research
 is
 not
 large.


Um,
 and
 there
 is
 also
 quote
 a
 connection


between
 ADHD,
 eating
 disorders,
 and


gender
 dysphoria.


>> Yes.


>> And
 I'm
 not
 [clears throat]


[laughter]
 I
 was
 just
 like
 I
 want
 to


throw
 everything
 against
 the
 wall.
 and


that
 quote,
 "Despite
 women
 with
 ADHD


being
 underresarched,
 there
 is


depressing
 amount
 of
 evidence
 that
 the


disorder
 puts
 us
 at
 an
 increased
 risk
 of


for
 unhealthy
 romantic
 relationships,


higher
 divorce
 rates,
 and
 more


unsatisfying
 sexual
 relationships.
 It


also
 substantially
 increases
 the


likelihood
 of
 experiencing
 intimate


partner
 violence.


>> Yeah,


>> it
 just
 feels
 like
 these
 are
 really
 big


things."
 I
 know.
 But
 I
 meant
 what
 I
 said


when
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 everything
 bad


you
 can
 think
 of
 happens
 more
 in
 this


population.


>> Why
 did
 you
 want
 to
 write
 this
 book?


>> Because
 I
 it
 was
 a
 book
 that
 I
 I
 wanted


when
 I
 got
 diagnosed
 and
 I
 I
 mean
 I've


gotten
 so
 many
 messages
 from
 people
 who


have
 ADHD
 and
 have
 found
 the
 book
 and


have
 been
 just
 like
 this
 is
 what
 I


needed
 to
 read
 and
 has
 made
 me
 feel
 so


much
 better
 about
 everything
 that
 I've


gone
 through.
 Um,


yeah.
 I
 I
 I
 wrote
 it
 for
 myself
 and
 all


the
 other
 Nowhere
 girls.


>> So,
 do
 you
 understand
 yourself
 better


now?


>> I
 think
 so.
 Like
 I
 feel
 like
 I


understand
 myself
 a
 little
 too
 well.


[laughter]


I'm
 like
 over
 aware
 of
 everything.


>> But
 there
 must
 be
 some
 grace
 that
 you


show
 yourself
 now.


>> Yes.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 was
 like
 my


biggest
 my
 ultimate
 I
 wanted
 the


ultimate
 takeaway
 of
 the
 book
 to
 be
 um


like
 we
 can't
 really
 control
 what
 we


have
 access
 to.
 We
 can't
 control
 if
 we


have
 access
 to
 the
 resources
 that
 make


life
 with
 ADHD
 easier,
 but
 we
 can


control
 working
 on
 being
 nicer
 to


ourselves.
 cuz
 so
 many
 of
 us
 struggle


with
 that
 same
 like
 automatic
 negative


patterns
 of
 thinking
 that
 we
 can
 at


least
 try
 to
 say,
 "Oh,
 I'm
 doing
 that


again.
 I'm
 trying
 to,
 you
 know,
 motivate


myself
 by
 being
 mean
 to
 myself.
 I'm


going
 to
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 like
 try
 to
 be
 nice
 to
 myself."


[laughter]


>> Um,
 it's
 been
 so
 nice
 talking
 to
 you,


Carla.
 I
 only
 have
 a
 few
 more
 minutes


left.
 Um,
 but
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 you


about
 some
 solutions
 and
 maybe
 um
 what


policy
 makers
 can
 do.
 Uh
 we
 talked
 a


little
 bit
 about
 the
 hormonal
 shift
 that


happens
 in
 adolescence.
 And
 because


women
 and
 girls
 weren't
 considered
 to
 be


impacted
 by
 ADHD,
 the
 research
 on
 ADHD


has
 centered
 around
 boys
 to
 the
 point


where
 if
 someone
 needs
 medication
 for


ADHD,
 that
 medication
 wasn't
 studied
 on


how
 it
 impacts
 women's
 hormones
 through


puberty,
 pregnancy,
 or
 pmenopause.
 Yeah.


>> Which
 is
 quite
 shocking.


>> It
 is
 shocking.
 And
 I
 I
 spoke
 with
 um
 a


Swedish
 doctor
 in
 the
 book
 who
 they
 have


a
 different
 model
 of
 care
 that
 is


basically
 gynecologists
 are
 working
 with


psychiatrists
 and
 psychologists


for
 this
 ADHD
 population
 to
 see
 whether


it
 is
 hormones
 that
 people
 need
 or
 ADHD


medication.
 And
 I
 just
 think
 that's
 so


lovely.
 Can
 you
 just
 imagine
 if
 our


doctors
 were
 able
 to
 work
 together


collaborative
 collaboratively
 like
 that


and
 just
 figure
 out
 like
 do
 the
 do
 the


best
 for
 us
 like
 for
 the
 individual


patients
 cuz
 so
 much
 of
 it
 is
 just
 put


on
 us
 to
 figure
 out
 and
 you
 know
 if
 you


have
 ADHD
 you
 have
 a
 you
 have
 a
 hard


time
 [laughter]


just
 sorting
 things
 out
 in
 general.
 So


it
 would
 be
 really
 nice
 to
 have
 like
 the


healthare
 system
 backing
 you
 up.
 you


wrote
 about
 like
 the
 how
 you
 came
 upon


your
 ADHD
 diagnosis
 and
 you
 already
 part


of
 the
 system.


>> Um
 [clears throat]


>> but
 for
 other
 people
 it's
 it
 seems
 to


cost
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


>> Yes.


>> And
 you
 also
 have
 to
 have
 the
 curiosity


around
 do
 I
 have
 this
 thing?


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 have
 to
 have
 some


knowledge
 of
 it
 first,
 right?


>> Yes.
 So
 what
 what
 do
 you
 want
 to
 say
 to


policy
 makers
 about
 the
 urgency
 in


course
 correcting
 this?
 Well,
 I'm
 the


last
 I
 when
 I
 last
 looked
 into
 it,
 I


think
 doctors,
 family
 doctors
 study
 ADHD


for
 like
 half
 a
 day
 in
 their
 training.


And
 so
 they
 and
 and
 they're
 not
 getting


trained
 on
 what
 it
 looks
 like
 in
 women


or
 even
 adult
 men
 quite
 frankly.
 Um,
 and


I
 know
 when
 I
 first
 reached
 out
 to
 my


family
 doctor
 about
 it,
 she
 said,
 "I'm


so
 sorry.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 enough
 about


it
 to
 give
 you
 an
 assessment."
 And
 so
 I


think
 that
 if
 that
 door
 could
 open
 a


little
 bit
 more
 if
 family
 doctors
 were


more
 informed
 about
 it,
 then
 it
 would
 it


would
 free
 up
 so
 much
 space
 in
 in
 our


health
 care
 system
 because
 we
 have
 like


three-year
 weight
 list
 to
 get
 in
 to
 see


psychiatrists
 who
 could
 do
 the


assessment.
 So
 I
 mean
 like
 everything


else,
 we
 just
 need
 more
 doctors
 and
 more


training.
 And
 and
 what
 do
 you
 say
 to


parents
 who
 maybe
 think
 that
 their
 child


isn't
 trying
 hard
 enough
 or,
 you
 know,


uh
 or
 maybe
 they
 think
 that
 they
 have


ADHD?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 well,
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 in
 the


system
 it
 it's
 hard
 to
 navigate,
 but
 if


you
 do
 think
 your
 child
 has
 ADHD,
 I


think
 you
 need
 to
 be
 their
 advocate.


Like
 that's
 what
 you
 become,
 right?
 So


you
 need
 to
 find
 a
 way
 or
 find
 go
 to


different
 doctors
 and
 research
 and


figure
 it
 out.
 That's
 basically
 what
 our


health
 care
 system
 has
 come
 to
 at
 this


point
 is
 just
 like
 you
 need
 to
 become
 a


researcher.
 [laughter]


>> And
 finally
 [clears throat]
 in
 schools


cuz
 I
 think
 this
 is
 where
 this
 is
 really


magnified.
 Yes.


>> Um
 I
 think
 teachers
 are
 heroes
 and
 um


having
 a
 child
 in
 the
 Ontario
 public


school
 system
 they're
 doing
 what
 they


can
 with
 what
 they
 have.


>> Absolutely.
 Um,
 but
 they
 have
 certain


markers
 when
 they're
 looking
 for


children
 who
 might
 need
 additional


supports.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 girls,
 they
 might


not
 always
 have
 what
 is
 perceived
 to
 be


those
 markers.


>> Sometimes
 girls
 because
 they
 become
 so


good
 at
 masking
 at
 such
 a
 young
 age,
 um,


they
 don't
 get
 identified.
 So
 the


teachers
 aren't
 aren't
 aren't
 missing


them
 necessarily
 because
 they
 want
 they


they
 don't
 care,
 but
 because
 girls
 are


so
 good
 at
 pretending.
 So,
 it
 does
 take


a
 really
 astute


teacher
 to
 notice
 what's
 going
 on
 with


girls,
 but
 the
 signs
 are
 there,
 right?


Like
 there's
 daydreaming,
 there's
 like


um
 jittery
 like
 fidgeting,
 there's


talking
 a
 lot,
 like
 just
 being
 a
 a


chatterbox


um
 and
 like
 forgetting
 things.
 And
 you


know,
 there
 there
 are
 signs
 that
 set


little
 girls
 with
 ADHD
 apart
 from
 the


population,
 but
 you
 just
 have
 to
 notice


them


>> and
 know
 what
 it
 what
 it
 is,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 And
 know
 what
 to
 do
 about
 it,
 too,


right?


>> Um
 is
 there
 anything
 that
 I
 you
 wanted


to
 talk
 about
 that
 I
 didn't
 ask
 you?


>> I
 don't
 think
 so.
 Yeah.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.
 [clears throat]


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 writing
 this
 book.


Um
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 help
 so
 many


people
 and
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 sharing


so
 many
 parts
 of
 yourself
 with
 us.


>> Thank

 much

 having
