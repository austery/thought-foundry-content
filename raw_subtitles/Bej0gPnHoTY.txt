Do you know your
organization's true purpose?
Many people say it's shareholder value,
the products you make
or the services you provide.
But it's much, much more than that.
It's like what really makes
your company's heart beat?
Well, in today's complex world,
shouldn't we all be thinking about that?
I know I had to when I became the CEO
of Build-A-Bear Workshop.
Back in 2013,
I was asked to take the helm
of this mall-based,
make-your-own stuffed animal
retail company for kids
from the beloved founder.
2012 had been the worst year
in the company's history,
having lost 50 million dollars
and 20 percent of the stores
were not turning a profit.
The team had struggled for eight years
in the wake of the recession,
mall traffic declines,
the rise of the digital economy.
Well, bankruptcy was a real threat.
So shortly after I got there,
I brought the whole organization together
to share my textbook turnaround plans.
That, of course, included cost cutting,
store closures and maybe some layoffs.
But I was met with skeptical
stares and silence.
Wow.
Don't they get it?
I mean, the world
had changed a lot since 1997
when Build-A-Bear was started.
But it was almost like
they were afraid to change.
But why?
Frustrated, I turned
to the crowd and I said,
"Does it matter if Build-A-Bear exists?"
Now, before you answer that question,
you might need to know
just a little bit more.
Build-A-Bear was a pioneer
in experiential retail.
So when you go to a store,
you go through a process.
Now, that process includes first
picking out an unstuffed furry friend,
but then, with the help 
of a “bear builder,”
you're able to go through a personalized
stuffing experience.
So that stuffing experience also includes
a very special heart ceremony.
Now, with this heart,
you bring your teddy bear to life
and you go through an informal
but very fun experience
of placing some attributes on your bear,
like maybe making them stronger
or making them smarter.
Maybe always have your back
or in your heart.
But then there's a very emotional process
that's very memorable,
and you put a wish on the heart
that ends with a kiss
and goes inside your heart,
often along with a personalized
recorded message.
Then you get to dress it,
name it, and get your birth certificate.
Now these experiences are woven
into millions of childhood memories,
and they're a part
of multigenerational family lore.
For everything from birthday celebrations
to graduations
to wedding proposals
and birth announcements.
So Build-A-Bear is a lot
more than a place.
In fact, Build-A-Bear
is often used for the Red Cross
to provide teddy bears
to people who need comfort
in natural disasters,
for parents who are grieving
the loss of a child
and even for children
who are suffering from illness.
So not only are we
so much more than a place,
we're a feeling.
Build-A-Bear is a feeling based
on memorable moments.
And it's for people of all ages.
So when I asked the team,
"Does it matter if Build-A-Bear exists?"
Of course they said yes.
But it wasn't because of my
textbook turnaround plans.
It was because they already
understood deeply
what I just shared with you.
And what I was telling them
made them fearful
that I was going to rip the heart out
of the company they had created.
So that let me know
that before they were going to go
on this journey with me,
they needed to know where my heart was,
and I needed to share plans
that were based on our true purpose.
And we need to find something
that we could all believe in,
as much as people believed
in the wishes on these hearts.
Well, that led to a new
and inspirational mission statement
of "we add a little more heart to life."
And yes, missions should be big.
And it created a strategy for us
that was based in something
that we had already organically become.
Build-A-Bear was already
more than its original vision.
We just needed a business plan
to profitably unlock that value.
So with that, the team was then able
to go through the tedious
process of turnaround
and return to some operational excellence
because it was just a step
in becoming something more.
But with heart.
So you're probably wondering, did it work?
Well, we returned
to profitability that very year.
But more importantly,
the more strategy which it became
helped us recognize we were not trapped
in the mall-based retail
that had created us.
So we opened in more places.
We understood where people were now going
for fun and entertainment,
like tourist locations, hospitality,
everything from cruise ships
to amusement parks to resorts.
And now we're in over
30 countries around the world,
with virtually all
of our stores profitable.
We embraced the digital economy
by opening a brand new website
that was focused on more categories
like gifting and collectibles.
And that took our web business
from less than five percent of total sales
to somewhere between 15
to 20 percent of total sales.
And that led us to recognize
that we could target more people.
That multigenerational aspect
that I was sharing,
that helped us to understand
that teens and adults
were a real target market for us.
And we happened to figure that out
right at the beginning
of a trend called "kidulting."
Yeah, that's a real thing.
(Laughter)
And so we doubled
the teen and adult business
that is now 40 percent of our sales.
I have to give the team a lot of credit
because they gave this a lot of heart.
And it was ten years of near-bankruptcy.
The retail apocalypse, activist investors,
Brexit and a global pandemic
where we had to shut down all
of our stores around the globe
in 48 hours
and our stock price dropped
to an all-time low.
Now, I'm happy to tell you,
250 million furry friends later
and a whole lot of heart ceremonies,
we have had four years of record results.
And recently, a stock price appreciation
of over 2,000 percent.
So yeah, a teddy bear company
outpacing tech giants
like Nvidia, Microsoft.
You've got to ask, how is that possible?
Is there a strategy smart enough
to make that happen?
Well, actually, I have to believe
that it all came down to getting in touch
with our real purpose, who we really were.
And that had to start with heart.
Uh-oh.
Am I seeing, skeptical stares
and maybe some silence?
I know what you're thinking.
You're thinking, all that heart stuff,
that works for companies
like Build-A-Bear.
But there's no way starting with heart
can be more important
than just being smart
when it comes to turnarounds and business.
OK, I'll give you that,
but I'm going to submit a quote to you,
widely attributed to Theodore Roosevelt,
the 26th president of the United States.
"Nobody cares how much you know
until they know how much you care."
Really, no matter how brilliant you are,
what your big idea is,
your financial acumen.
If nobody's going to put
their heart into your concepts,
it doesn't really matter, does it?
I'll tell you something else.
Your heart is the most consistent
and the strongest organ in your body.
It's also the first to develop,
not your brain.
So guess what?
It really does all start with heart.
I'll end with this.
Not only can starting with heart
change your organization.
It can change your life.
These days, even after I gather
all the data and ask everybody
and we figure it out
about what’s the next
big, smart thing we can do,
I always look in my heart
before we make a final decision.
I found, personally,
that a heart-centric approach to life
can unlock remarkable power, immense joy,
and in fact, provide
clarity and resilience
to focus on what is possible
while others are petrified
by what's probable.
It provides journeys
unfolding in amazing ways
with extraordinary outcomes,
including me being right here
today, on a TED stage,
sharing this story with you.
Do you believe your
organization can be more?
Do you believe you can be more?
Well, you're going to have to get
to where your power lies.
And that's going to require some courage.
Courage to look inside.
Maybe past the stuffing,
past a few pre-recorded voices,
to find your true purpose.
But that will only come
when you're willing
to find your own heart.
Thank you.
(Applause)
