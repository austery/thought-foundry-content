- We all know that digital computers
have changed the entire landscape.
Nations which can use
digital computers are rich,
they're powerful, they can communicate,
they can revamp the economy.
However, we're now in the initial stages
of the next revolution.
- [Interviewer] How quantum computers
will change everything.
- The next revolution
will be quantum computers
that will make the digital
computer look like an abacus.
In other words, the future
of digital computers
is to wind up in the garbage can.
We're talking about a new
generation of computers,
the ultimate computer, a
computer that computes on atoms,
the ultimate constituents
of matter itself.
Quantum computers have the capability
of changing every aspect of our life.
The economy, health, transportation,
everything could be changed
by quantum computers.
Take a look, for example, of food supply.
We rely upon fertilizers.
There was a green
revolution that took place
that allows us to feed the
population of the world.
But that green revolution
is slowly coming to an end.
We need a second green revolution,
being able to take nitrogen from the air
and combine it to make
ammonia and fertilizer.
And already we're trying
to use quantum computers
to unlock the secret of
how to make fertilizer
from nitrogen.
Also, take a look at energy.
Fusion power could one day give us
unlimited energy almost for free.
We're talking about an energy source
where the basic fuel is sea water,
fusion plants burn sea water,
the hydrogen of sea water,
to create fabulous amounts of
energy without nuclear waste,
without the threat of a meltdown.
And quantum computers may
be essential to stabilize
the vacuum and hydrogen so that
they don't cause an accident
or they don't fall apart.
So in other words, quantum
computers can affect
the economy in basic ways.
Not to mention medicine.
We create medicines by trial and error.
We create hundreds of chemicals
and test them one by one in a Petri dish.
This is old fashioned slow,
but that's all there is.
That's all we can do.
In the future, we'll be
able to model diseases
at the molecular level.
We'll be able to do molecular experiments
in the memory of a computer
rather than in a Petri dish,
trying to look at hundreds of chemicals
to find out which one
is medically relevant.
In other words,
we're talking about turning
medicine upside down.
The question is, who's
involved in this race
to perfect quantum computers?
And the answer is everyone.
If you're not part of the race,
you could be irrelevant in the future.
All the big names of the
computer industry, Google, IBM,
Honeywell, they're all in the game
because they realize that
you could become irrelevant.
Wall Street is always looking
for the next big investment,
and this could be it.
All of a sudden, we have
companies that just started
a few years ago becoming
multi-billion dollar companies
as they try to put their flag
on the mountain of quantum computers.
This is now big business.
This is one of the hottest stocks
that are available on
the stock market now.
In other words, it's a race.
All the big players in Silicon
Valley are part of this race
because if they're not Silicon Valley
could become the next rust belt.
We have something called Moore's Law,
which says that computer
power doubles every 18 months.
We take it for granted.
Every Christmas, your
computers are twice as powerful
as the previous Christmas.
The economy is based on that.
But Moore's law is falling apart.
Moore's law is getting slower and slower.
Finally, it'll flatten out.
And let me ask you a question.
Would you upgrade your computer
knowing that it's just as powerful
as the last few generations of computers?
No, this could cause a depression
in the computer industry.
We physicists called
attention to this decades ago,
but we said that, well, we
still have a few more decades
left, but it's coming.
It's coming because transistors
are getting smaller and smaller.
A transistor today could be,
let's say 20 atoms across.
When you start to hit five atoms across,
then electrons can then hop across
and create short circuits.
And Moore's law comes to an end.
We're now gradually
approaching that limit.
When you look at the curve
of the exponential growth
of computer power, it's quite remarkable.
This is where modern
technology has taken a leap,
but now we're beginning to level
off just like we predicted,
because of the quantum theory.
Electrons are not dots.
Electrons are waves.
Waves are probability,
and they're unstable if
you start to get electrons
and they analyze them
at the level of an atom.
So in other words, Silicon
Valley has to confront the fact
that Moore's law will eventually collapse.
So for all these reasons, we have to go
beyond digital computers
to atomic computers.
Computers that compute on atoms
rather than on transistors.
Right now, anyone who's interested
in security is interested
in the quantum computers is
quantum computers in principle,
have the power to crack any digital code.
Think about that for a moment.
All the data that is sent
on the internet is coded.
National Secrets of Nations
are encoded in these codes,
which often require you to
factorized very large numbers,
but that's what quantum computers can do.
They can factorized very large numbers
and thereby crack almost any code
that is based on digital technology.
That's why the FBI, the CIA,
and all national governments
interested in computer security
are following this very closely.
So for example, let's say you want
to have a secret that's encoded.
You put a code on it, and the code says,
you have to factorized a digit that is,
let's say 50 digits long.
It would take perhaps a few hundred years
for a digital computer to factorized
a number that is 50 digits long.
A quantum computer may be able
to do that almost instantly.
And so you see the anxiety
that this is being created
for people involved
with computer security.
You're not talking about
being able to break
into any other computer on the earth
that is based on digital technology.
Now, we're not there yet.
So you don't have to worry
that someone's gonna steal
all your secrets tomorrow,
but it will come.
And when it comes, we're gonna
have to have a major revision
of how we code our most
treasured national secrets.
Ordinary digital computers
compute on zeros and ones,
zeros and one.
But if you take a look at medicine,
you take a look at energy,
you take a look at molecules,
they're not based on zeros
and ones, zeros and ones.
They're based on electrons.
And electrons can be smooth,
not zeros and ones, zeros and ones.
And these electrons,
how come they have so
much computational power?
Because they could be in
two places at the same time.
Now, at this point, you
may say to yourself,
that's ridiculous, that's stupid.
How can you be two
places at the same time?
But that's exactly what electrons do.
Electrons can be multiple places
simultaneously at the same time.
That's what gives quantum
computers their power.
They compute on parallel
universes, not just one universe,
the universe that we're accustomed to,
but an infinite number
of parallel universes.
Now this sounds like
something from Marvel Comics,
but then the question is,
where did Marvel comics get this idea?
Marvel comics got this
idea from quantum physics
because the fundamental
basis of quantum physics
relies upon the fact that the electron
can be in multiple places
simultaneously at the same time.
One of the big goals of quantum computers,
not just creating new forms of energy,
new products, new forms of transportation,
but perhaps unlocking the
secret of life itself.
You realize that life
is based on molecules,
not zeros and ones, zeros and ones.
Molecules that in turn can
create Alzheimer's disease,
Parkinson's disease, cancer.
These diseases are beyond the
reach of digital computers.
But hey, this is what
quantum computers do.
They work with molecules,
they work with atoms,
they work with electrons.
And that's why we hope that one day
we'll be able to cure the
incurable using quantum computers.
Now, some people say,
won't that put doctors,
chemists and biologists out of a job?
Won't they be on the unemployment line
'cause we don't need them anymore?
No, in the future, the people
on the unemployment line
will be chemists and biologists
who do not use quantum computers.
The winners of this game
will be biologists, chemists,
mathematicians who use quantum computers
in the same way that a
carpenter uses a hammer.
A hammer does not replace the carpenter.
The hammer simply increases
the power of the carpenter.
And that's what quantum
computers will do for medicine,
transportation, energy, you name it,
quantum computers will be there.
