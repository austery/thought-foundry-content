All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 close.


It
 is
 Friday,
 December
 12th,
 and
 we
 are


ending
 out
 the
 uh
 second
 week
 of


December.
 Ugly
 day.
 Ugly,
 ugly
 day.
 I


mean,
 it
 was
 clearing
 up
 a
 little
 bit


before
 we
 left.
 It
 is
 still
 kind
 of


clearing
 up
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 some
 of


these
 individual
 stocks
 have
 been


getting
 hit.
 S&P
 500
 here
 right
 here


down
 about
 1.12%.
 I
 think
 the
 worst
 of


it
 was
 1.15.


And
 you've
 got
 the
 slightest
 of


slightest
 bounces,
 but
 nonetheless,


still
 a
 pretty
 nasty
 day.
 Nvidia
 right


there,
 175,
 that's
 down
 3%
 on
 the
 day.


Palenteer
 is
 down
 2%
 on
 the
 day.
 Hoodie


is
 down
 3.2%
 on
 the
 day.
 All
 these
 are


up
 a
 little
 bit
 from
 their
 absolute


lows,
 but
 nonetheless,
 they
 are
 still


down.
 Broadcom
 absolutely
 disgusting.
 It


got
 to
 355,
 it's
 at
 357.
 We'll
 talk
 more


about
 Broadcom,
 but
 that's
 down
 12%
 on


the
 day.
 was
 the
 first
 domino
 to
 fall,


which
 ended
 up
 cascading
 into
 a
 variety


of
 other
 AI
 headlines
 that
 ended
 up
 it's


not
 being
 pretty
 for
 the
 markets.
 Um,


but
 Broadcom
 got
 the
 brunt
 of
 it
 today.


Netflix
 holding
 on
 to
 its
 green,


Bitmine's
 down
 8%
 because
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum
 are
 down,
 Bloom
 Energy
 is
 down,


Iran
 is
 down,
 Amazon
 is
 down,
 all
 of


these
 names,
 anything
 that
 is
 in
 the


risk
 on
 part
 of
 the
 market.
 Bitcoin
 at


least
 holding
 above
 90,
 it
 did
 get
 to


89.5


is
 down.
 So,


what
 happened
 today?
 What
 happened


today?
 Well,
 I
 think
 at
 around
 11:00


a.m.
 Eastern
 this
 morning,
 there
 was
 a


headline
 that
 came
 out
 that
 uh
 OpenAI


would
 be
 delaying
 a
 data
 center
 buildout


with
 Oracle.
 And
 well,
 that
 made
 the


market
 a
 bit
 upset
 because
 the
 idea
 is


that
 OpenAI
 can't
 pay
 for
 any
 of
 these


data
 centers.
 A
 lot
 of
 this
 money
 is


fake.
 There's
 $300
 billion
 of
 remaining


performance
 obligations
 from
 Oracle


never
 really
 existed
 in
 the
 context
 of


OpenAI's
 potential
 deal
 with
 them.
 And


so
 the
 market's
 upset
 about
 this
 idea


that
 we're
 never
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get


uh
 this
 type
 of
 money
 and
 so
 we


shouldn't
 be
 giving
 Oracle
 this
 type
 of


a
 premium
 that
 bleeds
 into
 all
 the
 other


AI
 names.
 Oracle
 comes
 out
 an
 hour
 later


and
 says
 three
 things.
 Number
 one,
 site


selection
 and
 delivery
 timelines
 for


OpenAI
 data
 centers
 were
 set
 jointly


with
 OpenAI.
 There's
 no
 delays
 to
 any


sites
 and
 all
 milestones
 are
 still
 on


track.


Now
 this
 was
 somewhat
 appeasing
 to
 the


market.
 The
 market
 started
 to
 recover
 a


little
 bit
 when
 this
 news
 came
 out.


problem
 is
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 make


the
 argument
 that
 uh
 we're
 going
 to


immediately
 begin
 the
 performance


obligations
 from
 this
 openi
 contract
 in


2026
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 issue
 right


here.
 So
 you
 notice
 how
 they
 word
 site


selection
 and
 delivery
 timelines
 for


openi
 data
 centers
 were
 set
 jointly
 with


open
 AI.
 Basically,
 they're
 saying,


"Hey,
 if
 you
 guys
 think
 there's
 a
 delay,


then


yeah,
 maybe
 you
 can
 interpret
 it
 as
 a


delay,
 but
 Open
 AI
 and
 us
 always
 had,


for
 example,
 2027
 in
 mind,
 not
 2026."


So,
 they're
 kind
 of
 saying
 like,
 "Yeah,


it
 is
 a
 delay
 in
 the
 perception
 of
 what


you
 guys
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be,
 but


we
 never
 said
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 2026.


At least
 I
 don't
 think
 Oracle
 ever
 said


that.
 And
 so,
 we
 always
 thought
 it
 was


going to
 be
 2027,
 which
 means
 now
 that


the
 news
 is
 coming
 out
 that
 it's
 not


going
 to
 be
 2026,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 2027.


You
 guys
 want
 to
 freak
 out.
 That's
 not


our
 problem.
 That's
 your
 problem.
 I


think
 that's
 essentially
 how
 Oracle


framed
 this
 argument.
 And
 when
 they
 say


there
 were
 no
 delays
 in
 place,
 they're


basically
 saying,
 "We
 never
 thought
 it


was
 going
 to
 start
 that
 early."
 And
 if


you
 guys
 thought
 it
 was
 going to
 start


that
 early,
 again,
 that's
 not
 something


that
 we
 can
 be
 concerned
 about.
 Oracle


right
 here,
 their
 credit
 default
 swaps


got
 to
 a
 fourmonth
 high
 today.
 They're


up
 200%
 in
 the
 past
 four
 months.
 That


stock's
 still
 down
 4.72%
 on
 the
 day.


Same
 thing
 with
 Broadcom.
 So,
 you
 had


Broadcom
 that
 kicked
 it
 off
 down
 12%.


The
 reason
 Broadcom
 was
 down,


unfortunately,
 they
 also
 said
 that
 their


exclusive
 10
 gawatt
 ASIC
 data
 center


agreement
 with
 OpenAI
 is
 not
 going
 to


start
 in
 2026.
 Market
 wasn't
 upset
 about


that
 or
 market
 was
 pretty
 upset
 about


that
 last
 night,
 ended
 up
 being
 more


upset
 about
 that
 this
 morning.
 And
 then


you
 have
 another
 piece
 of
 OpenAI
 news


with
 Oracle.
 You're
 one-two
 shot
 that'll


give
 you
 a
 red
 day
 and
 that's
 obviously


affecting
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 stock
 market.


Nvidia
 being
 a
 big
 name
 that's
 going
 to


get
 hit
 because
 it's
 center
 in
 the
 AI


trade
 as
 that's
 down
 3%
 on
 the
 day.
 S&P


500
 down
 1.13%.


The
 crazy
 thing
 about
 this
 Tesla


actually
 holding
 green.
 So
 Tesla
 was
 at


463
 came
 all
 the
 way
 down
 to
 445
 now


it's
 back
 to
 457.
 So
 uh
 Tesla
 which


tends
 to
 be
 the
 most
 high
 beta
 MAG
 7


actually
 holding
 on
 to
 this
 momentum
 um


in
 the
 midst
 of
 some
 of
 this
 AI


collapse.
 But
 I
 the
 ironic
 thing
 about


this
 is
 that
 we
 were
 at
 alltime
 highs


yesterday
 after
 hours.
 And
 so
 I
 think


the
 whipssaw
 of
 emotions
 and
 price


trajectory
 and
 uh
 essentially
 price


action
 that
 we've
 been
 used
 to
 over
 the


past
 couple
 weeks
 that
 is
 continuing.
 We


had
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 reprieve
 over
 the


past
 week
 and
 a
 half
 as
 we
 got
 back
 from


Thanksgiving
 where
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 that


big
 of
 a
 deal
 or
 we
 thought
 it
 might
 not


be
 that
 big
 of a
 deal
 and
 it
 came
 right


back.
 BMR
 down
 9%
 on
 the
 days.
 I
 think


the
 takeaway
 here
 and
 you
 know
 we'll


talk
 more
 about
 some
 of
 this
 stuff
 as
 we


get
 through
 the
 show
 but
 uh
 the
 takeaway


is
 the
 market
 is
 fragile
 and
 the
 market


fundamentally
 gets
 scared
 every
 time


there
 is
 a
 hiccup
 on
 the
 AI
 narrative


and
 today
 we
 had
 two
 hiccups
 there's


there's
 no
 if
 ends
 or
 buts
 about
 it
 we


had
 two
 hiccups
 with
 this
 Oracle


headline
 whether
 the
 headline
 is


reasonable
 or
 not
 if
 it
 changes
 the


entire
 thesis
 or
 not
 which
 I
 don't
 think


it
 does
 but
 there
 were
 some
 hiccups
 and


that's
 why
 the
 market
 got
 upset
 and
 uh
 I


think
 that's
 why
 we're
 seeing
 some
 of


this
 pain.
 Okay,
 Trump
 is
 live
 right
 now


as
 well.
 We're
 getting
 some
 quotes
 from


him.
 Uh,
 let's
 pull
 up
 some
 of
 these


quotes
 right
 here.
 Trump
 says,
 "I'm


leaning
 towards
 Worsher
 Hasset
 to
 lead


the
 Fed."
 Trump
 says
 next
 Fed
 chair


should
 consult
 with
 him
 on
 interest


rates.
 Trump
 says
 interest
 rates
 should


be
 1%
 or
 lower
 a
 year
 from
 now.


Um,


I
 don't
 know
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 1%


rates
 uh
 next
 year,
 but
 there
 you
 go.


So,
 Trumpet
 is
 Trump
 is
 uh
 uh
 narrowing


the
 the
 search
 down
 to
 Hasset
 or
 Worsh,


which
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 we
 all
 thought,


but
 Hasset
 or
 Worish.
 I
 still
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 Hassid
 might
 like
 Worsh,
 but


uh
 Hassid
 might
 end
 up
 being
 the
 one
 who


wins.
 1%
 rates,
 that's
 what
 Trump
 is


saying
 right
 here.
 And
 yes,
 Trump
 asked


where
 he
 wants
 interest
 rates
 to
 be
 a


year
 from
 now.
 Trump
 said
 1%
 maybe
 lower


than
 that.
 I
 mean,
 obviously,
 Trump
 is


going
 to
 say
 whatever
 he
 wants
 to
 say,


but
 I
 don't know
 if
 we're
 actually
 going


to
 get
 1%
 rates
 or
 lower.
 we
 are
 I
 mean


maybe
 this
 market
 is
 going
 a
 lot
 higher


and
 if
 that
 results
 in
 a
 crazy
 bubble
 it


is
 what
 it
 is
 but
 if
 rates
 are
 going


lower
 you
 might
 have
 some
 money
 continue


to
 be
 put
 into
 the
 riskon
 area
 of
 the


market
 by
 the
 way
 speaking
 of
 money
 that


needs
 to
 be
 allocated
 money
 market
 funds


we
 didn't
 get
 to
 check
 it
 yesterday


because
 we
 had
 broadcom
 earnings
 kind
 of


a
 nothing
 burger
 1.19
 billion
 1.19


billion


I'm
 buying
 so
 many
 houses
 if
 I
 have
 1%


rates
 yeah
 hopefully
 that
 gets
 mortgage


rates
 down
 to
 at least
 3
 or
 4%.
 If
 not


lower.
 Uh
 but
 then
 again,
 you
 know,
 it's


going to
 be
 hard
 to
 see
 if
 that
 actually


plays
 out.
 1.19
 billion
 into
 money


market
 funds
 that
 came
 in
 over
 the
 past


week.
 Last
 week
 it
 was
 85
 billion.
 So


again,
 nothing
 too
 crazy,
 but
 that
 is


what
 we
 got.
 All
 right,
 let's
 hear
 from


uh
 Oswth
 and
 see
 his
 perspective.
 He's


the
 dean
 of
 valuations
 at
 NYU.
 This
 is


his
 current
 thoughts
 on
 the
 state
 of
 the


AI
 trade
 and
 where
 the
 market
 is
 going.


>> Awesome.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 at
 the
 basis


for
 why
 there's
 so
 much
 disagreement.
 It


depends
 on
 how
 plausible
 you
 see
 that


pathway
 is.
 Give
 you
 an
 example.
 Take


Nvidia
 at
 a
 $5
 trillion
 market
 cap.
 If


they
 can
 maintain
 their
 existing


nosebleleed
 margins,
 53%
 net
 margins,


return
 on
 equity
 in
 the
 triple
 digits,


they
 can
 get
 there
 with
 600
 billion
 in


revenue,
 which
 is
 not
 a
 big
 deal.
 I


mean,
 they're
 at
 170
 billion
 already.


With
 20%
 growth,
 you
 can
 get
 there.
 So


the
 people
 who
 are
 upbeat
 about
 Nvidia


are
 seeing
 a
 plausible
 pathway
 there
 if


they
 can
 if
 they
 can
 do
 that.
 The


question
 is
 is
 that
 probable
 and
 that's


where
 the
 disagreement
 comes
 in.
 And
 I


think
 that's
 why
 it's
 got
 to
 be


personal.
 It's
 not
 something
 that
 you


can
 hear
 from
 other
 people.
 You
 got
 to


look
 at
 the
 numbers
 and
 say
 I
 can
 live


with
 this.
 I
 can
 make
 this
 assumption


and
 be
 okay
 with
 it.
 And
 every
 one
 of


these
 companies
 I
 think
 has
 a
 plausible


pathway
 to
 get
 to
 the
 market
 gap
 they're


at.
 And
 you
 know,
 as
 long
 as
 that's


there,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 disagreement


about
 these
 stocks.


>> I
 think
 what's
 really
 provocative
 from


you
 today
 in
 terms
 of
 your
 notes
 to
 our


producers
 is
 that
 you
 put
 forth
 that


this
 is
 not
 the
 bifurcated
 market
 that


some
 would
 paint
 it
 to
 be.
 That
 the


remaining
 493
 are
 also
 trading
 in
 your


mind
 hefty
 multiples
 of
 earnings.


Explain.
 Mhm.
 I
 mean,
 you
 take
 the
 seven


out
 of
 the
 S&P
 500,
 look
 at
 the
 rest
 of


the
 market.
 It's
 trading
 at
 22
 to
 23


times
 earnings.
 And
 you
 could
 argue
 that


the
 remaining
 493
 companies
 have
 much


less
 rosy
 operating
 metrics
 than
 the
 Mag


7.
 They
 don't
 have
 the
 kinds
 of
 margins


and
 the
 growth
 that
 the
 MAG
 7
 have.
 So,


when
 people
 talk
 about
 this
 being
 a


bifurcated
 market,
 they
 act
 like
 the
 Mag


7
 is
 essentially
 the
 only
 they're
 the


only
 ones
 that
 are
 overvalued.
 The
 rest


of
 the
 market
 somehow
 is
 fairly
 valued.


I
 don't
 think
 that's
 true.
 This
 is
 a


richly
 priced
 market
 across
 the
 board.


If
 you
 fact
 the
 differences
 in
 margins


and
 growth,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 the
 remaining


493
 are
 bargains
 relative
 to
 the
 Mag
 7.


They
 look
 pretty
 richly
 priced
 to
 me
 as


well.


>> What
 looks
 undervalued
 to
 you?
 If


anything,
 I
 presumably
 you've
 thought


about
 that.


>> It's
 I
 mean
 that's
 why
 I
 said
 coming
 to


a
 conclusion
 that
 the
 Mag
 7
 are


overvalued,
 the
 rest
 are
 undervalued
 is


going
 to
 be
 tough
 to
 do
 because


everything's
 been
 pushed
 up.
 It's
 like
 a


rising
 tide.
 And
 with
 the
 Mag
 7,
 you


have
 this
 added
 oomph
 of
 a
 high
 growth


plus
 high
 margins
 at
 scale.
 I
 mean,


that's
 the
 amazing
 part
 is
 they're


growing
 when
 there
 are
 150
 billion,
 200


billion,
 $250
 billion
 revenue
 companies.


That's
 I
 think
 you
 know
 almost


unprecedented
 and
 the
 market
 is


factoring
 that
 in
 rewarding
 these


companies.
 Whether
 they
 can
 keep
 doing


that
 becomes
 the
 area
 of
 disagreement


because
 I
 think
 that
 things
 only
 get


rockier
 and
 more
 difficult
 from
 this


point
 on.
 You
 saw
 that
 when
 Google


announced,
 you
 know,
 announced
 that


these
 new
 chips
 that
 compete
 with
 Nvidia


chips.
 You
 saw
 the
 sharp
 sell
 off
 in


Nvidia.
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 more


shocks
 like
 that
 to
 the
 system
 and
 the


question
 whether
 the
 story
 can
 hold
 up.


>> Huh.
 What
 does
 your
 own
 portfolio
 look


like
 these
 days?
 You
 you've
 never
 really


been
 shy
 in
 in
 sharing
 the
 moves
 that


you
 make.
 Could
 you
 could
 you
 do
 it


again?


>> I'm
 down
 to
 five
 of
 the
 max
 seven.


They're
 there
 because
 they
 were
 all


they've
 been
 there
 and
 they're
 not


overvalued
 enough
 that
 I
 want
 to
 dump


them.
 I
 did
 you
 know
 sell
 off
 the
 rest


of
 my
 Nvidia
 shares
 just
 recently
 and
 I


think
 the
 la
 that
 was
 the
 last
 segment


of
 Nvidia.
 I've
 you
 know
 I
 and
 if
 it


continues
 to
 go
 up
 all
 the
 more
 power
 to


people
 who
 continue
 to
 hold
 in
 video


Nvidia
 but
 for
 me
 I
 think
 I've
 gained


enough
 from
 its
 from
 its
 rise
 that
 be


greedy
 for
 me
 to
 hang
 in
 there
 say
 give


me
 more


>> but
 do
 do
 you
 agree
 with
 those
 who
 say


that
 2026
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 see


more
 dispersion
 among
 the
 mega
 cap


stocks
 among
 the
 mag
 sevens
 that
 they're


just
 not
 all
 going
 to
 trade
 like
 the


monolith
 that
 they
 once
 did


>> and
 they
 have
 for
 about
 a
 year
 right


even
 If
 you
 look
 at
 this
 year,
 they've


been
 the
 max
 seven
 have
 moved
 in


different
 directions.
 This
 is
 not
 2022


or
 2023.
 But
 if
 you
 could
 tell
 me
 what


one
 of
 the
 max
 seven
 stocks
 did
 during
 a


week,
 I
 could
 tell
 you
 what
 the
 other


six
 did.
 Now,
 if
 you
 tell
 me
 what


Bitcoin
 did
 today,
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 what


Nvidia
 did
 did.
 I
 think
 you
 have
 a


better
 shot
 of
 predicting
 how
 these


stocks
 will
 do
 by
 looking
 outside
 of
 the


Mac
 7.
 So,
 uh,
 the
 perspective
 continues


to
 be
 by
 Oswth
 that,
 uh,
 everything
 is


overvalued
 and,
 you
 know,
 he's
 been


holding
 some
 of
 these
 maximum
 names
 for


a
 long
 time,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 guess
 he's


not
 selling
 some
 of
 the
 other
 ones.
 Uh,


he
 is
 out
 of
 Nvidia.
 He
 does
 not
 believe


this
 one
 is
 worth
 holding
 on
 to.
 And
 the


S&P
 4,
 wow,
 Oaklo
 down
 14%.
 I
 didn't


even
 see
 that.
 And
 down
 two,
 Roblox
 down


six.
 Everything
 is
 really
 hard
 to
 find


some
 safety.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 Netflix
 was


safe.
 uh
 Verizon,
 Tesla
 ended
 up
 being


safe
 today.
 Lulu
 ended
 up
 being
 safe,


but
 everything
 else
 getting
 hit.
 His


argument
 is
 the
 S&P
 493
 are
 also


overvalued
 and
 there's
 not
 a
 decent


level
 of
 excitement
 there.
 Now,
 uh
 we're


going
 to
 listen
 to
 some
 other
 clips


throughout
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 show,
 but
 uh


I
 don't
 know
 if
 you
 guys
 have
 had
 a


chance
 to
 listen
 to
 the
 new
 Tom
 Lee


podcast
 on
 Prof
 on
 on
 Scott
 Galloway's


thing.
 I
 I
 think
 I
 played
 like
 a
 one


minute
 clip
 of
 it
 in
 the
 morning.
 I


listened
 to
 the
 whole
 thing
 throughout


like
 since
 I
 left
 the
 market
 open,
 guys.


He's
 not
 the
 most
 bullish
 and
 we'll


we'll
 analyze
 it.
 But
 if
 you
 listen
 to


Tom
 and
 you
 really
 listen
 to
 what
 he's


saying,
 he's
 not
 he's
 not
 bullish.
 like


he's
 he
 has
 this
 $7,700
 target,
 but
 even


the
 way
 he
 was
 answering
 questions
 about


bubbles,
 concerns
 around
 AI,
 the
 way


he's
 talking
 about
 the
 labor
 market,
 I


mean,
 you
 guys
 can
 judge
 for
 yourself


when
 you
 listen
 to
 it,
 but
 it's
 not
 the


same
 bullish
 Tom
 Lee
 from
 a
 month
 ago.
 I


mean,
 fundamentally,
 I
 felt
 there
 was


something
 different
 and
 in
 in
 many


respects,
 he
 was
 agreeing
 with
 a
 lot
 of


the
 arguments
 um
 that
 the
 podcasters


were
 asking
 asking
 him
 about
 and
 that


came
 from
 a
 much
 more
 bearish


perspective.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 he
 has
 a


target,
 but
 he's
 calling
 for
 a
 20%
 draw


down
 on
 the
 S&P
 before
 we
 get
 anywhere


near
 7,700.
 And
 so,
 I
 I I
 thought
 I
 just


thought
 it
 was
 interesting
 to
 listen
 to


how
 he's
 kind
 of
 framing
 it.
 And
 we'll


kind
 of
 go
 through
 it
 together.
 But,


nonetheless,
 you
 are
 seeing
 some
 more


people
 start
 to
 ask
 deeper
 questions.


And
 unfortunately,
 on
 a
 day
 where
 Oracle


ends
 up
 giving
 you
 this
 OpenAI
 news,
 it


compounds
 and,
 you
 know,
 results
 in
 a


pretty
 negative
 day.
 And
 unfortunately,


that's
 what
 we're
 kind
 of
 seeing
 on


today.
 So,
 we
 got
 the
 close
 in
 about
 10


seconds.
 We'll
 talk
 more
 about
 it.
 We'll


talk
 about
 some
 of
 this
 Japan
 stuff


coming
 up
 next
 week
 as
 well.
 We
 have a


couple
 other
 macro
 headlines.
 We
 got


we're
 getting
 these
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


quotes
 from
 Trump
 now
 about
 the
 Fed.
 And


so,
 we'll
 go
 deeper
 into
 that
 and


analyze
 what
 that
 looks
 like
 as
 we
 get


into
 the
 close.
 All
 right,
 Friday,


December
 12th,
 4
 p.m.
 Thank
 you


everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 The
 stock


market
 is
 now
 closed
 and
 we
 have
 ended


out
 the
 second
 week
 of
 December.


All
 right,
 the
 bleeding
 stopped.
 Yes,


hopefully
 after
 hours
 gets
 the
 bleeding


to
 take
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 of
 a
 pause.


But
 nonetheless,
 ugly
 day.
 No
 way
 else


to
 kind
 of
 frame
 it
 other
 than
 it
 was


ugly.
 Nvidia
 right
 there
 175
 down
 about


3.2%.
 Nvidia
 now
 $4.25
 trillion
 market


cap
 down
 from
 about
 4.7
 earlier
 in
 the


week.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there
 681


uh
 that
 was
 down
 about
 1%
 on
 the
 day.


EOSE
 that
 was
 down
 9%
 Oaklo
 down
 15%.


Every
 energy
 name
 got
 hit
 based
 on
 the


idea
 that
 Oracle
 and
 OpenAI
 were


delaying
 these
 data
 centers
 and
 as
 a


result
 of
 delaying
 these
 data
 centers
 uh


the
 energy
 names
 are
 feeling
 some
 of
 the


pain
 because
 the
 energy
 names
 were
 going


to
 catch
 a
 bid
 because
 of
 the
 data


centers.
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that's
 the


reason.
 Maybe
 there
 was
 something
 else.


Obviously,
 a
 lot
 of these
 names
 are
 high


beta,
 but
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 you're


seeing
 a
 lot.
 I
 mean,
 even
 ens
 we we


talked
 about
 ENS
 on
 equity
 edge
 um
 like


three
 weeks
 ago.
 The
 stock
 does
 not
 have


a
 massive
 multiple.
 Even
 this
 one
 was


down
 on
 the
 day
 $5
 billion
 market
 cap


given
 if
 it
 given
 it's
 in
 the
 energy


ecosystem.
 Robin
 Hood
 down
 3%
 on
 the


day.
 Palenteer
 down
 2.1%.
 Paler
 still


holding
 180.
 It
 was
 down
 to
 179
 at
 one


point.
 So,
 you
 did
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


rebound,
 but
 that
 is
 down
 from
 about
 187


early
 in
 the
 morning.
 Apple
 little
 bit


of
 safeties
 today.
 278.
 That
 is
 green.


Oscar
 was
 up
 about
 5
 percent.
 There
 is


now
 a
 30%
 chance
 on
 prediction
 markets


that
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 shutdown.
 It


was
 like
 10%
 last
 week.
 So
 something


happened
 throughout
 the
 day
 to
 get
 the


prediction
 markets
 to
 think
 that
 we
 will


get
 a
 much
 higher
 probability
 of
 a


shutdown,
 which
 again
 is
 not
 the
 best


news
 going
 into
 January.
 So
 we'll
 see


any
 implications
 from
 that.
 UNH,
 that's


up
 about
 1.4%.
 Grab
 did
 hold
 around
 520


throughout
 the
 day.
 Ended
 up
 falling
 3


cents
 as
 we
 got
 to
 the
 end
 of the
 day,


515.
 So
 that's
 down
 about
 half
 a


percent,
 but
 it
 was
 holding
 520
 for
 the


majority
 of
 the
 day.
 The
 weed
 stocks
 uh


still
 ended
 up
 doing
 well.
 Aurora


Cannabis
 up
 18%
 on
 the
 day.
 We
 did
 not


get
 an
 executive
 order
 with
 the


scheduling
 of
 marijuana
 as
 a
 schedule
 3


drug.
 Uh
 so
 that
 hasn't
 happened
 yet,


but
 that
 still
 is
 getting
 the
 market
 to


be
 excited.
 Planet
 Labs
 right
 there.


That's
 up
 4.38%.
 And
 then
 where
 is


Rocket
 Lab?
 Rocket
 Lab
 is
 holding
 61.
 Up


a
 good
 percentage
 for
 the
 week.
 Can't
 be


too
 upset
 about
 it.
 Down
 from
 65.
 So


down
 3%
 on
 the
 day,
 but
 still
 holding


60,
 which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.
 Disney,
 we
 had


that
 big
 announcement
 with
 Open
 AI.
 That


one's
 basically
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Verizon


was
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Uh,
 and
 then
 Tesla,


which
 I
 still
 don't
 know
 why
 Tesla


pumped.
 I
 think
 the
 executive
 order
 on


the
 federal
 mandate
 for
 AI
 standards


probably
 is
 going
 to
 make
 FSD
 more


regulated
 and
 not
 have
 to
 go


state-tostate
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 through


unsupervised
 FSD.
 And
 maybe
 that's
 the


reason
 for
 the
 pump.
 But
 outside
 of


that,
 not
 sure
 why
 Tesla
 got
 a
 bid,
 but


it
 was
 one
 of the
 only
 Max
 7
 today
 that


got
 a
 bid.
 Amazon
 as
 well
 ended
 down
 on


the
 day
 2.3%
 226


on
 Amazon
 as
 we
 are
 ending
 out
 this


market
 for
 the
 close.
 Amcor
 was
 down
 as


well.
 I
 mean
 Amcor
 is
 a
 big
 supplier


with
 uh
 Amcore
 down
 6%
 with
 Broadcom.
 So


unfortunately


Broadcom
 11.43%


Broadcom
 lost
 about
 40
 billion
 in
 market


cap.
 A
 lot
 of
 derivative
 plays.
 Where


did
 Google
 end?
 Google
 309.
 Okay.
 It
 was


308
 in
 the
 morning.
 305
 at
 the
 bottom.


309
 to
 jump
 to
 that
 one.
 Still
 down
 1%


as
 well.


That's
 what
 we
 got.
 That's
 what
 we
 got


on
 the
 day.
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 you
 bought


the
 dip.
 Uh
 if
 you
 took
 advantage
 of
 any


of
 these
 stocks.
 I
 bought
 a
 couple
 of


these
 names
 in
 the
 morning.
 Uh
 not


massive
 massive
 amounts,
 but
 just
 a


nibble
 on
 some
 of
 my
 kind
 of
 core


positions
 that
 I
 care
 about.


Outside
 of
 that,
 and
 again,
 we'll
 we'll


we'll
 go
 deeper
 and
 talk
 into
 it,
 but
 I


don't
 know.
 Today's
 price
 action
 was


weird.
 You
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 different


perspectives
 come
 through
 and


some
 of
 those
 perspectives
 argue
 that


this
 Oracle
 stuff
 is
 stupid.
 Other


perspectives
 came
 through
 and
 said,


well,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 beginning


of
 something
 bigger
 in
 regards
 to
 the


delay
 of
 data
 center
 construction,
 which


theoretically
 could
 hurt
 a
 lot
 of these


other
 names.
 And
 you
 know,
 we
 we
 know


that
 there's
 a
 bottleneck
 when
 it comes


to
 power
 for
 data
 centers.
 So,
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 surprising.
 But
 the
 deeper


concern
 is
 like
 the
 way
 the
 market


priced
 a
 lot
 of
 AI
 stocks
 today
 was
 that


there's
 no
 demand
 for
 data
 centers.
 It


wasn't
 even
 like
 oh
 there's
 a
 logistical


concern
 about
 how
 to
 set
 up
 the
 data


center.
 It's
 like
 oh
 no
 there's
 no


demand
 which
 is
 not
 the
 case
 or
 at least


that's
 not
 the
 evidence
 that
 we
 were


presented
 today.


But
 yeah,
 as
 Happy
 Mey
 says
 right
 there,


the
 market
 is
 very
 conflicted
 right
 now.


Incredibly
 conflicted.
 And
 that's
 why
 I


think
 we're
 seeing


some
 of
 the
 uh
 some
 of
 the
 pain.
 Uh,
 I


see
 some
 Nvidia.
 I
 see
 VG.
 I
 see
 Next.
 I


see
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 Netflix.
 Uh,
 I
 see


some
 Hood.
 I
 see
 SoFi.
 VRT.


I
 see
 Broadcom.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 are


waiting
 for
 360,
 355.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got


close
 to
 355
 this
 morning.
 VRT.
 Look
 at


that.
 Down
 9%
 of
 the
 day.
 Another
 data


center
 play
 in
 um
 in
 liquid
 cooling.
 I


see
 a
 bunch
 of
 Nebuses.
 I
 ran.
 Did
 that


close
 below
 40?


That's
 Yeah.
 Well,
 no,
 not
 below
 40,
 but


just
 above
 it.
 Still
 down
 8%
 on
 the
 day.


Rubric
 M.
 Like,
 why
 was
 Rubric
 down?


Like,
 did
 the
 data
 center
 think
 have


anything
 to
 do
 with
 Rubric?
 They
 had
 a


great
 earnings.
 So,
 I
 do
 think
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 unnecessarily
 took
 a
 hit,


but
 they
 did
 indeed
 take
 a
 hit.
 Bitcoin,


right,
 they're
 90,000.3


as
 that
 was
 down
 about
 2%
 on
 the
 day.


Amit,
 do
 you
 think
 Tesla's
 good
 for


covered
 calls
 here?
 To
 be
 honest,
 I
 I


don't
 know
 why
 Tesla
 moved
 today.
 If


anyone
 has
 a
 reason,
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the


chat.
 So,
 yeah,
 I
 would
 still
 be


conservative,
 but


Tesla
 breaking
 out
 to
 500
 by
 end
 of
 year


or
 even
 that
 480,
 490
 might
 be
 a
 little


tough
 if
 the
 S&P
 is
 not
 helping
 it
 get


there.
 Going
 against
 the
 S&P
 today
 was


nice
 to
 see,
 but
 then
 again,
 Tesla
 does


this
 all
 the
 time
 and
 then
 it
 tanks
 the


next
 week.
 Like,
 it's
 just
 one
 of
 those


names
 that
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 momentum
 up
 or


down.
 That's
 what
 makes
 the
 premiums


amazing.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 wouldn't
 get
 super


aggressive
 and
 do
 like
 a
 460
 call,
 but


like
 475,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 too
 crazy


going
 through
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month.


Rivian,
 Rivian
 was
 up
 20%
 on
 the
 day.


Rivian
 ended
 up
 only
 down
 12
 up
 12%.


Still
 a
 great
 day
 for
 Rivian.
 Let's
 look


at
 the
 heat
 map
 today.
 Rivian,
 Lulu,


couple
 of
 these
 defensives
 ended
 up


holding
 on
 throughout
 the
 day.
 This
 was


what
 tech
 looked
 like.
 It
 was
 red.


Microsoft,
 Oracle,
 Palanteer,
 Broadcom,


Nvidia,
 AMD,
 Micron
 both
 were
 down
 five%


on
 the
 day.
 Financials
 held
 strong.


Healthcare
 held
 strong.
 Google
 and
 Meta


got
 hit.
 Netflix
 held
 strong.
 Amazon
 got


hit.
 Again,
 Tesla
 was
 one
 of
 the
 only


tech
 stocks
 that
 was
 actually
 green


along
 with
 Adobe.
 Adobe
 got
 some
 love


today.
 That
 was
 up
 2%.
 And
 then
 Walmart,


Costco,
 Consumer
 Defensives
 ended
 up


holding


a
 little
 bit
 of
 green.
 Did
 Tesla
 move
 on


the
 Rivian
 news?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 I


think
 maybe
 a
 little
 weird
 if
 that
 would


be
 the
 case.


Yeah,
 the
 Marco's
 like,
 "OMG,
 Rivian


chip's
 going
 to
 replace
 Nvidia
 and
 data


centers,
 right?"
 Like
 that's
 how
 it


almost
 felt
 Rivian
 moved
 today
 based
 on


the
 the
 chip
 announcement.
 But
 um
 yeah,


I
 don't
 think
 Tesla
 necessarily
 followed


that.
 Okay,
 let's
 uh
 let
 let's
 let's


let's
 pull
 up
 this
 Tom
 Lee
 argument
 uh


on
 the
 podcast
 today.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 do


think


there
 maybe
 it's
 just
 me,
 but
 and
 he


still
 is
 bullish,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 there


is
 a
 different
 context
 of
 how
 he


presented
 his
 arguments.
 And
 I'll
 let


you
 guys
 be
 the
 the
 the
 uh
 the
 jury
 of


this.
 So,
 let's
 play
 this
 for
 a
 couple


minutes
 and
 we'll
 get
 some
 perspectives.


But
 there
 is
 a
 the
 the
 point
 of
 what


he's
 saying
 in
 this
 podcast,
 at least


that's
 what
 I
 got
 from
 it
 is
 expect
 a


downturn
 of
 20%
 next
 year.
 Like
 be
 ready


for
 that.
 That
 will
 happen.
 It's
 almost


like
 he's
 speaking
 that
 it's
 inevitable


because
 we're
 getting
 frothy
 essentially


is
 what
 I
 got
 from
 his
 argument.
 And


then
 you'll
 get
 a
 recovery
 to
 7,700


which
 means
 we
 would
 have
 to
 recover,


you
 know,
 much
 more
 than
 20%.
 But
 that's


kind
 of the
 broader
 argument
 that
 I
 got


from
 this
 podcast.


And
 do
 you
 think
 those
 would
 be
 the


trigger
 of
 such
 a
 correction?


>> Let's
 start
 with
 the
 one
 that
 you
 just


mentioned.
 The
 stock
 market,


you
 know,
 it
 we're
 up
 16%.
 So
 I
 think
 if


we
 rally
 three
 percentage
 points,
 we'll


be
 three
 years
 of
 20%
 gains
 back
 to


back.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 actually


>> a
 couple
 of
 you
 guys
 in
 the
 comments


saying,
 "I
 picked
 up
 on
 how
 you're


feeling."
 Okay,
 so
 I'm
 happy
 the
 rest
 of


you
 guys
 will
 hear
 right
 now,
 but
 I'm


happy
 it's
 not
 just
 me.
 There's
 a
 couple


of
 you
 that
 listened
 to
 the
 podcast


already
 and
 you're
 saying
 you
 picked
 up


on
 that
 same
 feeling.
 I
 think
 it's
 kind


of
 evident
 the
 way
 that
 he's
 describing


kind
 of
 what
 he
 thinks
 could
 play
 out


for
 2026.


>> More
 common
 than
 we
 realize.
 Um,
 in


fact,
 when
 we
 look
 at
 uh
 the
 last
 65


years,
 you
 know,
 it's
 happened
 in
 20


different
 I
 think
 it's
 happened
 20
 times


in
 different
 countries
 um
 and
 multiple


times
 in
 the
 US.
 I'm
 sorry,
 12
 times.
 It


means
 a
 lot
 of
 good
 news
 is
 priced
 in.
 I


mean,
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 stocks
 being


up
 20%
 a
 year,
 three
 years
 in
 a
 row,


it's
 definitely
 pricing
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 good


news.
 So,
 to
 me,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 we
 have


to
 consolidate
 those
 gains
 and
 and


that's
 why
 I
 I
 think
 a
 draw
 down
 next


year
 makes
 perfect
 sense
 to
 me.
 But,
 uh


because
 there
 isn't
 a
 lot
 of
 leverage
 in


the
 economy,
 you
 know,
 household
 sector


has
 not
 really
 borrowed
 money.
 It's
 been


expensive
 to
 borrow
 money
 and
 even


margin
 debt,
 it's
 risen,
 but
 it
 hasn't


risen
 parabolically.


So,
 it's
 actually
 essentially
 tracked


S&P
 gains.
 Um,


so
 that's
 it's
 not
 like
 people
 are


borrowing
 faster
 than
 the
 market's
 been


going
 up,
 especially
 if
 you
 look
 at
 a


5-year
 um
 kagger.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 would
 be
 in


the
 camp
 that
 as
 long
 as
 the
 economy's


holding
 up
 that
 draw
 down
 is
 going
 to
 be


viewed
 as
 as
 a
 buying
 opportunity.
 Um


now
 on
 AI
 valuations


it
 makes
 perfect
 sense
 for
 someone
 to


say
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 valuations
 for
 AI
 are


probably
 absurd
 because


this
 is
 the
 nature
 of
 like
 of
 a
 of
 a


exponential
 sector,
 right?
 If
 we


look
 at
 a
 industry
 that
 could
 grow


parabolically
 for
 10
 years,


all
 of
 the
 future
 value


is
 in
 the
 latter
 half
 of
 those
 years,


right?
 So
 it's
 and
 then
 we're
 trying
 to


discount
 that
 back
 to
 today.
 And
 so


stocks
 are
 going
 to
 look
 absurdly


expensive.
 And
 more
 importantly,


investors
 make
 a
 common
 mistake,
 which


is
 that
 they
 assume
 that
 the
 existing


universe
 of
 companies


are
 going
 to
 be
 the
 central
 cast


characters
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years,
 which


is
 not
 the
 case.
 So,
 the
 reason


valuations
 don't
 make
 sense
 today
 is


that
 one
 of
 all
 the
 AI
 stocks,


I'd
 say
 it's
 probably
 safe
 to
 say
 only


10%
 are
 going
 to
 be
 good
 investments.


Maybe
 it's
 even
 generous,
 maybe
 5%.
 I


mean,
 when's
 the
 last
 time
 you
 heard


that
 from
 Tom
 Lee?
 By
 the
 way,
 Derek,


thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 for


the
 gifted
 gifted
 50.
 50
 of
 you
 guys


just
 got
 gifted
 memberships
 courtesy
 of


Mr.
 Derek
 Wall.
 So,
 thank
 you,
 Mr.
 Wall,


for
 those
 gifted
 50.
 But,
 I
 mean,
 again,


when's
 the
 last
 time
 you
 heard
 Tom
 Lee


say
 that
 only
 10%
 of
 the
 AI
 companies


today
 are
 going
 to
 be
 good
 investments?


That's
 being
 generous.
 Maybe
 5%.


And
 again,
 that's
 a
 totally
 reasonable


opinion.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 actually,


one
 could
 argue,
 a
 logical
 opinion.


There's
 a
 lot
 of these
 AI
 stocks
 that


are
 just
 like
 stupid.
 but
 you
 never


heard
 it
 from
 Tom
 in
 that
 much
 of
 an


explicit
 way.
 And
 and and
 as
 you
 go


through
 the
 podcast,
 you
 start
 to


recognize
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 cause
 for


concern
 that
 he's
 putting
 out
 there,
 but


he's
 also
 kind
 of
 saving
 himself,
 right?


Because
 he's
 like,
 "Oh,
 20%
 draw
 down,


but
 then
 we
 recovered
 to
 7,700."
 It's


like,
 I
 love
 you,
 Tom,
 but
 you're


playing
 both
 sides
 here,
 right?
 I
 mean,


we
 have
 a
 last
 time
 we
 had
 a
 30%
 draw


down.
 The
 only
 reason
 we
 recovered
 in


five
 months
 is
 because
 Trump
 immediately


pivoted
 the
 whole
 tariff
 stuff.
 I
 mean,


if
 if
 it's
 not
 like
 a
 light
 switch
 type


of
 buy
 the
 dip
 opportunity
 like
 it
 was


in
 April,
 which
 was,
 you
 know,
 that


doesn't
 happen
 that
 often
 to
 go
 down
 20%


and
 then
 recover
 40%.


I
 I
 I
 mean,
 it
 begs
 the
 question
 like


how
 likely
 of
 a
 scenario
 do
 you
 think


that
 is?
 I
 I'd
 rather
 believe
 in
 a


situation
 where
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 massive


draw
 down,
 but
 we
 also
 don't
 have
 a


massive
 upside
 case.
 So
 maybe
 the
 S&P
 is


5%
 next
 year
 on
 on on
 on
 that


perspective,
 but
 to
 go
 down
 20
 then
 go


up
 40,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 plausible
 that


is
 to
 to
 believe
 as
 well.


>> And
 of
 course,
 um
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a


new
 emergence
 set
 of
 new
 players.
 And
 in


fact,
 the
 economic
 model
 might
 change,


but
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 a
 bad


investment.
 And
 and
 we
 we've
 highlighted


this
 as
 generational
 trades
 in
 past


reports.
 For
 instance,
 like
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 internet


um
 if
 you
 bought
 the
 internet
 basket
 in


99,
 okay,
 so
 you
 bought
 it
 near
 the
 peak


and
 you
 held
 it
 to
 today,
 you
 actually


still
 outperform
 the
 S&P
 500
 even
 though


99%
 of
 the
 stocks
 went
 to
 zero.
 So
 it


wasn't
 it
 was
 a
 bad
 investment
 if
 you


tried
 to
 pick
 a
 winner,


>> but
 it
 wasn't
 so
 bad
 if
 you
 held
 it
 as
 a


basket.
 So,
 I
 think
 AI,


it's
 probably
 going to
 be
 fair
 to
 say


90%
 of
 the
 stocks
 are
 going
 to
 be
 do
 way


worse
 than
 people
 expected.
 They
 were


too
 optimistic.
 But
 I
 think
 as
 a
 basket,


it's
 probably
 going to
 outperform.


>> That
 all
 makes
 sense
 to
 me.
 I'm
 with


you.
 But
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit


more
 nerve-wracking
 when
 we
 realize
 that


a
 lot
 of
 the
 AI
 companies
 are
 the


largest
 companies
 in
 the
 world.
 It's
 the


big
 tech
 companies.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


Google
 is
 an
 AI
 company
 at
 this
 point
 or


an
 AI
 stock.
 Meta,
 Nvidia,
 I
 mean
 these


are
 the
 largest
 most
 valuable
 companies


in
 the
 world.
 Um,
 and
 the
 market
 really


depends
 on
 their
 their
 performance.
 So


when
 I
 think
 about
 the
 idea
 that
 you


know
 many
 of
 these
 companies
 and
 the
 and


the
 expectations
 that
 have
 been
 pinned


to
 the
 AI
 cycle,
 the
 fact
 that
 that


could
 affect
 some
 of
 the
 largest
 most


valuable
 companies
 in
 the
 world
 where


we're
 seeing
 the
 highest
 concentrations


in
 those
 small
 companies
 that
 higher


concentration
 than
 we've
 ever
 seen
 uh
 in


history
 to
 me
 that
 makes
 it
 scarier
 what


you
 just
 said.
 So,
 I
 guess
 my
 question


is,
 do
 those
 companies,
 do
 the
 big
 tech


companies,
 the
 Magnificent
 7,
 do
 they


count
 in
 your
 analysis
 of
 AI
 valuations


being
 too
 high
 and
 the
 possibility
 that


perhaps
 we
 might
 lose
 out
 or
 that
 that


the
 value
 won't
 actually
 show
 up
 for


many
 of
 these
 companies?


>> I
 might
 even
 just
 add
 to
 your
 concern


because
 there's
 a


>> again
 I
 might
 even
 just
 add
 to
 your


concern
 like
 I'm
 I'm
 just
 I'm
 just


presenting
 what
 I
 heard
 an
 hour
 ago.
 I


mean,
 you
 got
 Tom
 Lee
 saying,
 "Yeah,


you're
 right.
 And
 here's
 another
 reason


to
 be
 concerned."
 I
 I'm
 just
 saying
 it's


obviously
 we're
 trying
 to
 crowdsource


perspectives
 and
 understand
 this
 stuff,


but
 this
 was
 not
 the
 type
 of
 bullish


sentiment
 you've
 been
 hearing
 from
 him


throughout
 the
 entire
 year


>> because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 capex
 here
 too.


So
 that
 these
 are,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


the
 mag
 seven
 used
 to
 be
 asset
 light


businesses.
 you
 know
 they
 the
 remarkable


uh
 equity
 you
 sort
 of
 rent
 seeeking


model
 of
 them
 was
 that
 they
 could
 create


growth
 with
 very
 little
 spending.
 I
 mean


R&D
 spending
 was
 there
 but
 really
 was


not


>> there
 but
 today
 as
 you
 know
 uh
 AI
 is


extremely
 capital
 intensive
 and
 it's


energy
 intensive


and
 it's
 only
 justifiable
 if
 it's


replacing


real
 work
 somewhere
 else
 then
 you
 can


justify


>> because
 now
 it's
 creating
 assets
 to


replace
 future
 opex
 you
 know
 I'm
 going


to
 give
 you
 a
 spin


about
 what's
 happening
 that
 is
 not


disagreeing
 with
 what
 you're
 saying
 but


it's
 probably
 observing
 a
 change
 in
 the


reality.
 Okay,
 which
 is


tech
 companies
 are
 becoming
 a
 bigger


part
 of
 our
 life.
 Um
 so
 naturally


they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 larger
 share
 of


spending.
 Uh,
 by
 the
 way,
 we
 wrote
 about


that
 um
 in
 2018
 that
 in
 if
 you
 go
 back


to
 1930


and
 you
 just
 use
 simple
 demography,


okay,
 population
 tables,
 whenever
 the


population
 growth
 rate
 grows
 faster
 than


the
 prime
 age
 workforce,


which
 means
 you
 have
 compounded
 labor


deficit,
 you've
 always
 had
 a
 technology


cycle.


That
 was
 1948-67


and
 1991
 to99.
 In
 both
 of
 those
 periods,


the
 population


growth
 rate
 was
 growing
 fast,
 which
 is


demand
 faster
 than
 worker
 supply.


And
 we
 entered
 the
 third
 epic
 or
 era
 of


labor
 shortage,
 which
 started
 in
 2018


and
 it's
 going
 to
 last
 to
 2035.


So
 then
 technology
 spend


is
 necessity
 because
 you
 don't
 have
 as


much
 labor
 available.
 So
 there's
 going


to
 be
 less
 wage
 spend.


>> Yeah.


>> Now
 if
 I
 substituted
 the
 word
 and
 called


this
 um
 instead
 of the
 word
 banks
 uh


tech
 companies
 I
 called
 them
 financial


institutions.


We
 would
 not
 be
 saying
 there's
 a


financial
 institution
 bubble
 because
 for


every
 level
 for
 every
 unit
 of
 GDP


growth,
 there's
 a
 unit
 of
 financial


spend.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 literally
 the
 other


part
 of
 the
 ledger.
 And
 in
 fact,
 the


financial
 industry
 has
 all
 circular


spending.
 I
 mean,
 think
 about
 this.
 Real


estate
 is
 valued
 as
 a
 separate
 asset,


but
 every
 company
 needs
 real
 estate
 just


to
 run
 a
 business.
 So,
 why
 are
 we


valuing
 real
 estate
 like
 in
 a
 GDB
 sense?


Real
 estate
 should
 be
 an
 interim


product,
 not
 a
 final
 product.
 Um,
 so
 I


think
 tech
 is


becoming
 so
 central
 to
 the
 economy,


especially
 because
 of
 labor
 shortage,


that
 we're


when
 we
 see
 tech
 intensity
 growing,


people
 are
 flagging
 that
 as
 a
 bubble,


whereas
 I'm
 actually
 just
 pointing
 out


is
 it's
 it's
 actually
 out
 of
 economic


necessity.
 But
 it
 becomes
 a
 bubble
 if


the
 multiple
 we're
 applying
 to
 the
 tech


streams
 don't
 justify
 higher
 valuation.


I
 think
 tech
 earnings
 are
 probably
 more


valuable
 than
 Costco
 for
 instance.


>> Yeah,
 I
 agreed.


>> Or
 Walmart,
 right?
 But
 do
 you
 know


Walmart
 trades
 at
 37
 times
 board


earnings
 and
 Costco
 trades
 at
 50
 times?


So
 Nvidia
 trading
 at
 27.


I
 mean
 is
 that
 is
 there
 a
 bubble
 in


Costco
 and
 Walmart?
 Because
 Nvidia
 is
 at


27
 times
 earnings


>> 100%.
 And
 we've
 looked
 at
 that.


>> So
 uh
 you
 can
 listen
 to
 the
 podcast


yourself
 and
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 there


he's
 still
 making
 the
 argument
 right


there.
 I'll
 put
 the
 link
 to
 the
 podcast


in
 the
 chat
 that
 obviously
 we
 are
 not


necessarily
 seeing
 the
 the
 bubishious


behavior
 that
 the
 street
 is
 expecting
 or


or
 even
 perceiving
 because
 of
 for


example
 Costco
 and
 Walmart
 not
 being
 the


most
 important
 financial
 institutions
 or


companies
 in
 the
 country
 very
 important


countries
 but
 one
 could
 argue
 that
 the


tech
 companies
 are
 probably
 more


important
 but
 a
 company
 like
 Nvidia


which
 is
 at
 the
 center
 of
 the
 AI
 trade


is
 not
 trading
 at
 a
 euphoric
 multiple


given
 it's
 trading
 at
 uh
 25
 times
 next


year's
 earnings
 so
 I
 mean
 look
 there
 is


an
 It
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 takeaway
 I
 got


from
 that
 is
 a
 hedge
 to
 both
 sides.


There
 is
 an
 analysis
 on
 why
 for
 the


first
 time
 ever
 I've
 heard
 Tom
 say
 90%


of
 the
 AI
 stocks
 are
 going
 to
 zero
 which


look
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 stupid
 crappy
 dumb


names
 that
 just
 put
 AI
 in
 the
 ticker
 and


they
 say
 like
 they're
 an
 AI
 company.


They're
 not
 even
 growing.
 Like
 yeah


those
 are
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 be
 some


of the
 best
 companies
 in
 the
 world.
 But


it's
 the
 first
 time
 you
 heard
 Tom
 say


90%
 of
 the
 AI
 cap
 bucket
 of
 stocks.
 I


mean,
 he's
 essentially
 comparing
 it
 to


the
 internet
 stocks,
 which
 90%
 of
 those


went
 to
 zero.
 And
 we
 got
 Amazon
 and


Google
 from
 it,
 which
 why
 it
 ended
 up


outperforming
 the
 S&P
 because
 those


companies
 were
 just
 so
 transformational.


And
 I'm
 assuming
 the
 most
 important


transformational
 AI
 companies
 will


probably
 outperform
 the
 S&P
 over
 the


next
 10
 years.
 But
 you
 are
 seeing
 the


first
 resemblance
 of
 him
 making
 that


claim
 that
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies


probably
 are
 invaluable.
 And
 then
 sort


of
 the
 second
 argument
 he's
 making
 right


here
 is
 that
 um
 this
 idea
 of


consolidating
 the
 gains
 after
 a


three-year
 bull
 market
 which
 is
 entirely


reasonable
 and
 I
 don't
 even
 think


there's
 like
 a
 problem
 in
 in
 in
 this


argument
 this
 in
 this
 chain
 of
 thinking


from
 a
 like
 logic
 perspective
 that
 if


you
 have
 three
 years
 back
 to
 back
 of
 20%


let's
 say
 we
 end
 this
 year
 at
 15
 16%


whatever
 it
 is
 um
 those
 are
 a
 massive


three
 years
 we
 have
 to
 consolidate
 the


problem
 is
 his
 argument
 and
 this
 is
 the


part
 where
 he's
 losing
 me
 here
 is
 that


let's
 just
 Say
 S&P
 ends
 the
 year
 at
 690.


Okay,
 690
 losing
 20%
 would
 put
 us
 back


at


um


552.


Okay.
 552
 on
 the
 S&P.
 So
 then
 to
 get
 to


770,


we
 would
 have
 to
 go
 up
 Yeah.
 39%
 39.4%


40%
 to
 get
 to
 his
 level
 of
 770
 7700.


So
 his
 outlook
 and
 again
 we're
 going to


get a
 lot
 more
 outlooks
 from
 a
 lot of


these
 other
 banks.
 Not
 all
 of
 them
 agree


with
 him,
 but
 Tom
 Lee
 is
 saying
 we're


going
 to
 go
 down
 from
 690


essentially
 to
 550
 and
 then
 somehow


someway
 we're
 going
 to
 rocket
 ship
 back


up
 to
 77,700.


Yeah,
 it
 it
 would
 be
 a
 repeat
 of
 2025.


The
 difference
 is,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I


don't
 know
 how
 I'm
 probably
 missing
 some


some
 some
 economic
 history
 here,
 but
 how


many
 times
 have
 we
 gone
 30%
 and


recovered
 within
 two
 months?
 And
 the


reason
 we
 went
 down
 30%
 was
 because
 of


Liberation
 Day.
 The
 reason
 we
 recovered


is
 because
 Trump
 said,
 "Buy
 the
 dip."


Like,
 there
 was
 an
 obvious
 catalyst
 to


the
 downside
 and
 then
 that
 catalyst


immediately
 reversed
 to
 the
 upside.
 It


it
 was
 an
 anomaly.
 It
 created
 one
 of the


best
 buying
 opportunities
 in
 history.


But
 like
 to
 expect
 that
 to
 happen
 twice,


I
 don't
 know.
 And
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 that


would
 even
 have
 a
 chance
 of
 happening,


right?
 Like
 no
 one
 expected
 the


liberation
 day
 thing
 to
 be
 as
 insane
 as


it
 was.
 No
 one
 expected
 the
 recovery
 to


be
 as
 insane
 as
 it
 was.
 Do
 do
 we
 get


something
 like
 that
 happening
 again?


But
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it
 sounds


kind
 of
 off
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 down


20
 and
 then
 go
 up
 40.
 And
 I
 think
 he's


trying.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 we
 go
 down


20,
 I
 mean,


where
 where
 the
 hell
 is
 Ethereum
 go?
 If


the
 S&P
 is
 down
 20%.


What?
 Ethereum's
 down
 50,500.
 If
 that


Bitcoin
 obviously
 gets
 destroyed
 in
 that


scenario,
 and
 if
 that
 does
 happen,


obviously
 that's
 the
 time
 to
 buy.
 Like


if
 we
 have
 a
 20%
 drought
 on
 ever
 on
 the


S&P,
 you you
 know
 that
 forget
 extreme


fear.
 You
 know
 that
 that
 is
 the
 moment


you
 buy.
 The
 problem
 is
 to
 try
 to


predict
 that
 then
 we'll
 go up
 40%
 and


recover
 all
 those
 gains
 and
 go
 higher,


especially
 if
 you
 have
 more
 AI
 bubble


fears
 that
 can
 compound
 on
 each
 other.
 I


just
 don't
 know
 if
 that
 narrative
 makes


sense
 for
 next
 year.
 I
 think
 there's


other
 ways
 you
 can
 make
 a
 narrative
 for


what
 happens
 in
 2026,


but
 I'm
 not
 going
 crazy,
 right?
 Like


that
 just
 sounds
 a
 little
 not


believable.
 And
 it's
 the
 first
 time
 and


it's
 ironic
 that
 this
 podcast
 dropped
 on


a
 day
 where
 this
 whole
 Oracle
 OpenAI


stuff
 came
 through.
 Um
 but
 but
 it
 is
 a


bit
 ironic
 that
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 his


frame
 of
 analysis
 right
 here
 and
 then


you
 know
 you're
 getting
 these
 concerns


about
 data
 science.


So
 look
 I
 think
 we
 have
 to
 obviously
 do


a
 lot
 more
 work
 and
 in
 terms
 of
 analyze


what's
 going
 on.
 We're
 gonna
 this
 Tom


Lee
 is
 just
 one
 person.
 I'm
 gonna
 try
 to


get
 a
 lot
 more
 opinions
 on
 seeing
 some


of
 what
 these
 other
 companies
 are


saying.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 what
 the


consensus
 S&P
 target
 is
 for
 next
 year


because
 I
 think
 the
 highest
 I've
 seen
 is


8,100.
 I
 think
 Everor
 at
 9,000
 in
 like


their
 Super
 Bowl bull
 case
 and
 then
 you


know
 the
 the the
 the
 I
 guess
 the
 lowest


I've
 seen
 so
 far
 is
 like
 5700
 6,000
 but


we
 haven't
 had
 a
 consensus
 view.
 The


consensus
 going
 into
 2026,
 by
 the
 way,


or
 2025


was
 6750,


which
 we're
 probably
 going
 to
 close


above
 if
 we,
 you
 know,
 hold
 these
 levels


and
 don't
 fall
 another
 two
 or
 3%.


Because
 we're
 at
 681,


but
 the
 analysts
 kind
 of
 got
 it
 right


going
 into
 2025
 because
 I
 mean,
 we're


relatively
 at
 that
 same
 level
 unless
 we


get
 back
 up
 to
 to
 7,000.


So


yeah,
 I
 think
 these
 are
 two
 things
 that


we
 definitely
 need
 to
 think
 about.
 Would


the
 Supreme
 Court
 tariff
 ruling
 be
 the


reason
 for
 the
 draw
 down?
 Um
 I
 I


actually
 think
 that
 would
 be
 the
 reason


for
 the
 uh
 upswing
 because
 the
 market


doesn't
 like
 tariffs.
 The
 Fed
 definitely


doesn't
 like
 tariffs.
 Inflation


potentially
 might
 not
 be
 that
 big
 of
 an


issue.
 Although
 there's
 two
 push
 backs


to
 that.
 Number
 one,
 the
 administration


came
 out
 yesterday.
 I
 think
 uh
 Bent
 said


that
 they've
 got
 or
 it
 was
 either
 Bent


or
 Hassid
 said
 they
 have
 plans
 to
 deal


with
 the
 Supreme
 Court
 if
 if
 they
 do


overturn
 overturn
 the
 tariff
 stuff.
 So


they're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 institute
 the


tariffs
 in
 a
 different
 way.
 And
 then
 the


other
 argument
 here
 is
 that
 I
 mean
 to


the
 draw
 down
 point
 it's
 like
 if
 the


market
 has
 uncertainty
 around
 tariffs


that's
 not
 a
 good
 thing.
 Even
 if
 Trump


is
 able
 to
 finagle
 his
 way
 into
 still


implementing
 the
 tariffs
 which
 would


also
 create
 more
 uncertainty
 because


then
 it
 would
 probably
 be
 questioned


from
 a
 legal
 perspective.
 So
 yeah,
 could


it
 result
 in
 a
 draw
 down?
 100%.
 Could
 it


also
 result
 in
 an
 upswing
 and
 then
 maybe


later
 the
 market
 because
 they're
 just
 so


scared
 about
 what's
 exactly
 going
 to


happen
 that
 results
 in
 a
 bit
 of a
 draw


down?
 Yes.
 But
 again,
 no
 one
 knows.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 why
 it
 creates
 a
 lot
 more


uncertainty.
 Uh
 let's
 listen
 to
 his


perspective
 on
 the
 labor
 market
 because


that
 is
 also
 a
 pretty
 important
 issue


right
 here.
 And
 this
 is
 what
 he
 had
 to


say
 about
 where
 labor
 will
 go.
 One
 of


the
 other
 bare
 cases
 for
 most
 people
 is


that
 if
 we
 have
 this
 AI
 boom,
 but
 people


lose
 their
 jobs,
 that's
 not
 necessarily


going
 to
 be
 the
 healthiest
 for
 the


economy.


>> We're
 in
 this
 labor
 shortage
 cycle
 from


2018
 that
 will
 last
 through
 2035.


And
 I
 I
 just
 you
 can't
 avoid
 the


catastrophizing
 around
 the
 destruction


of
 the
 labor
 force
 from
 AI.
 Do
 you
 still


believe
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 a
 cycle
 of


labor
 shortage
 even
 with
 AI?
 I


vacasillate
 because
 there's
 times
 where


I'm
 I
 like
 when
 I
 read
 a
 book
 like
 The


Coming
 Wave,
 I
 panic
 and
 I
 realize
 like,


wow,
 like
 we
 uh
 we
 need
 to
 re-educate


society.
 Um,
 but
 one
 thing
 that
 gives
 me


hope
 is
 that
 we
 did
 at
 Funstretch
 study


another
 technological
 wave
 that
 wiped


out
 at
 least
 20%
 of
 the
 labor
 force
 um


in
 in
 the
 20th
 century
 which
 was
 frozen


foods.
 So,
 what
 many
 people
 don't


realize
 is
 that
 when
 Charles
 Birdsy


uh
 created
 Flash
 Frozen,
 which
 by
 the


way
 was
 a
 venturebacked
 by
 Goldman


Sachs,
 it
 was
 a
 VC
 backed
 um
 company.


>> I
 love
 this.


>> And
 by
 the
 way,
 his
 name
 is
 Bird's
 Eye


cuz
 he
 was
 an
 ornithologist.
 He
 actually


was
 studying
 birds.
 Um,
 but
 he
 found


that
 the
 Anoui
 tribe
 in
 Alaska
 had
 kept


their
 fish
 super
 fresh
 and
 because
 they


were
 putting
 it
 in
 a
 frozen
 saltwater


solution
 that
 flash
 froze
 the
 fish.
 If


we
 look
 at
 the
 labor
 tables
 from
 the


20s,
 40%
 of
 the
 US
 labor
 force
 was


employed
 on
 farms.
 It
 was
 literally
 we


spent
 most
 of
 the
 economy
 was
 people


working
 on
 farms
 and
 most
 of
 the
 service


sector
 that
 was
 defined
 back
 then
 were


household
 servants,
 people
 working
 for


someone
 else.
 food
 was
 over
 25%
 of
 the


wallet
 prior
 to
 frozen
 foods
 being
 uh


widely,
 you
 know,
 mass
 market
 because


most
 spoiled
 on
 the
 way
 to
 the
 supply


chain
 and
 so
 grocery
 aisles
 were
 mostly


fresh
 and
 what
 they
 what
 was
 frozen
 back


then
 had
 freezer
 burn.
 It
 was
 terrible.


So
 um
 flash
 frozen
 allowed
 suddenly
 the


cost
 of
 food
 to
 drop
 dramatically


because
 you
 had
 less
 spoilage
 and
 the


number
 of
 people
 working
 on
 a
 farm
 today


is
 down
 to
 what
 2%
 of
 the
 US
 workforce.


So
 flash
 frozen
 was
 the
 really
 the
 key


innovation
 that
 brought
 down
 the
 cost
 of


food
 from
 20%
 of
 the
 wallet
 to
 what
 is


it
 five
 or
 6%
 today
 and
 reducing
 farming


labor
 from
 more
 than
 I
 think
 it
 was
 40%


of
 the
 peak
 down
 to
 two


an
 economist
 in
 1920
 okay
 let's
 just


pretend
 on
 CNBC
 in
 1920
 there
 is
 none


but
 let's
 say
 there
 was
 a
 CNBC
 in
 1920


and
 these
 economists
 were
 saying
 frozen


food
 if
 it
 comes
 along
 and
 it's
 going
 to


wipe
 out
 95%
 of
 all
 farmers


this
 is
 going
 to
 wipe
 out
 the
 US
 economy


the
 US
 economy
 can't
 survive
 uh
 frozen


food
 and
 instead
 it
 freed
 up
 time
 right


and
 it
 created
 it
 allowed
 people
 to
 be


repurposed
 and
 it
 created
 a
 completely


new
 labor
 force
 so
 I
 so
 Scott
 to
 your


point
 I
 think
 that
 there
 is
 an
 adverse


outcome
 but
 then
 when
 I
 look
 at
 past


episodes
 of
 huge
 labor
 disruption.
 It's


actually
 had
 positive
 outcomes


>> every
 Okay,
 that
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 detail
 and


storytelling
 to
 make
 the
 argument
 that


AI
 will
 open
 up
 new
 opportunities
 and


jobs.
 But
 as
 you
 can
 tell
 from
 this
 pod,


I
 mean,
 I
 really
 don't
 think
 it's
 just


me.
 You're
 getting
 a
 glimpse
 of
 him


making
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 just
 a
 a
 sort
 of


pivot
 in
 terms
 of
 his
 perception
 of
 how


he's
 thinking
 about
 the
 labor
 market,


how
 he's
 thinking
 about
 AI.
 Obviously,
 a


lot
 of
 data
 backs
 his
 research,
 which
 is


fair,
 but
 it
 it
 starts
 to
 get
 very


confusing
 when
 you
 make
 the
 argument


that
 90%
 of
 the
 stocks
 overvalued,
 20%


draw
 down,
 40%
 upside
 after
 that
 draw


down,
 and
 that's
 how
 the
 story
 plays


out.
 Like,
 it's
 just
 it
 feels
 like
 Tom


is
 confused,
 and
 that's
 okay.
 He's
 a


human
 being.
 He's,
 you
 know,
 he's


allowed
 to
 be
 confused.
 But
 nonetheless,


it
 does
 feel
 like
 he's
 a
 bit
 confused


here.
 Let's
 bring
 someone
 on
 to
 the
 show


that
 uh
 well,
 they've
 not
 been
 that


confused
 about
 the
 story
 around


semiconductor
 stocks.
 Let's
 see
 if


Broadcom
 or
 Oracle
 ended
 up
 potentially


making
 him
 a
 bit
 more
 confused
 today.


Ladies
 and
 gentlemen,


Jose,
 what's
 up?


>> What's
 going
 on,
 brother?
 How's


everything?


>> Everything's
 good.
 We
 had
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 crappy
 day
 today
 and
 I
 think
 uh
 you


can
 definitely
 help
 us
 give
 some


analysis
 on
 what's
 going
 on.
 I
 think


we'll
 start
 off
 with
 Oracle
 before
 we


get
 to
 Broadcom.
 We
 didn't
 talk
 since


the
 earnings.
 Uh
 Neil
 and
 I
 streamed


this
 one
 together.
 Which
 by
 the
 way,
 I


kept
 calling
 him
 Jose.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


you


you
 kept
 saying
 Jose
 and
 I
 didn't
 notice


and
 like
 he
 would
 just
 look
 at
 me
 and


I'd
 be
 like,
 "Why
 aren't
 you
 answering


me?"
 I'd
 be
 like, "Oh
 [ __ ]
 I
 just


called
 you
 Jose."
 So
 yeah,
 he's
 European


Jose
 now.
 But
 um


>> it's
 because
 you
 you you
 wish
 I
 was


there.
 Unfortunately,
 I
 was
 not


unfortunately,
 but
 I
 I
 I
 had
 a
 had
 to


take
 the
 little
 one
 to
 a
 few
 things
 that


day.


What
 was
 your
 perspective
 on
 Oracle


earnings
 and
 with
 that
 any
 thoughts
 on


this
 Oracle
 opening
 data
 center
 delay


that
 we
 got
 today?


>> Uh
 I
 I
 mean
 I
 thought
 Oracle
 earnings


was
 a
 great
 insight
 of
 the
 AI
 market.
 I


mean
 they
 mentioned
 that
 this
 quarter


alone
 they
 grew
 RPO
 by
 I
 forget
 the


actual
 number
 but
 it
 was
 north
 of
 60


billion
 just
 in
 one
 quarter.
 Um
 and
 it


wasn't
 just
 on
 OpenAI,
 right?
 I
 think


that's
 one
 thing
 that
 they
 wanted
 to
 do


was
 kind
 of
 escape
 the
 OpenAI
 um
 bare


thesis
 that
 was
 once
 a
 bold
 thesis
 now


it's
 like
 a
 bare
 thesis.
 It's
 funny
 how


the
 market
 reacts.
 Um
 but
 they
 mentioned


that
 this
 RPO
 was
 mainly
 because
 of


Nvidia,
 Meta
 and
 other
 names.
 Uh
 so
 they


they
 at least
 try
 to
 diversify
 and
 then


within
 that
 RPO
 it
 doesn't
 have
 much


changes
 this
 fiscal
 year
 which
 ends
 in


two
 quarter
 but
 it
 did
 add
 an
 extra
 $4


billion
 to
 next
 fiscal
 year
 in
 their
 OCI


and
 $4
 billion
 I
 think
 last
 time
 they


projected
 around
 34
 billion
 so
 4
 billion


is
 about
 a
 15%
 growth
 on
 guidance
 just


on
 OCI
 which
 I
 thought
 is
 is
 impressive


right
 just
 um
 just
 in
 in
 in
 the
 matter


of
 a
 quarter
 uh
 because
 of
 that
 right?


They
 had
 to
 increase
 capex
 by
 15


billion.
 um
 capex
 I I
 think
 was
 50


billion
 now
 um
 with
 the
 new
 guided


that's
 numbers
 that
 like
 it's
 it's


matching
 to
 the
 big
 boys
 right
 it's


matching
 not
 as
 not
 necessarily
 to
 it


but
 um
 it's
 getting
 up
 there
 right
 I


think
 meta
 was
 like
 uh
 eight
 seven
 I


forget
 the
 actual
 numbers
 I
 know
 most
 of


them
 were
 in
 the
 north
 but
 Oracle
 is


getting
 good
 is
 getting
 up
 there
 that
 I


think
 was
 very
 bullish
 for
 AI
 chip


companies
 in
 general
 because
 it
 means


they're
 going
 to
 spend
 an
 extra
 $15


billion
 within
 the
 next
 two
 quarters


because
 they
 just
 finished
 this
 quarter.


So
 this
 is
 for
 this
 extra
 15
 billion
 is


for
 this
 fiscal
 year.
 So
 an
 extra
 two


quarters
 where
 they're
 going
 to
 spend
 an


extra
 15
 billion
 than
 they
 expected.
 Um


so
 overall
 for
 the
 ecosystem
 and
 I'll


throw
 it
 back
 to
 you
 just
 in
 case
 you


have
 any
 questions
 but
 to
 the
 overall


ecosystem
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 bullish
 in


forms
 of
 AI
 compute
 demand
 and
 it
 was


bullish
 for
 for
 the
 infrastructure


players
 per
 se
 and
 then
 it
 was
 bullish


for
 the
 semiconductor
 ecosystem
 because


they're
 going
 to
 be
 spending
 more
 money


in
 the
 um
 in
 that
 AI
 infrastructure


itself.
 Do
 you
 think
 then
 the
 decline
 of


the
 stock
 from
 220
 to
 189
 had
 more
 to
 do


with
 the
 debt
 that
 they
 said
 they're


probably
 going
 to
 be
 issuing
 a
 lot
 more


for
 this
 buildup?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 so.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


for
 them,
 um
 I


when
 you
 hear
 this
 crazy
 500,
 I
 think


sometimes
 the
 market
 just
 doesn't


listen.
 um
 they
 have
 this
 523
 billion


RPO
 and
 most
 people
 are
 expecting
 it
 to


be
 this
 year
 or
 next
 year.
 They
 actually


gave
 a
 perfect
 picture
 of
 it's
 actually


like
 16
 billion.
 I
 forget
 the
 actual


number.
 So
 don't
 don't
 excuse
 me
 for
 not


being
 correct,
 but
 it's
 like
 something


around
 16
 billion
 this
 fiscal
 year,
 34


billion
 next
 fiscal
 year
 and
 then
 64
 and


it
 continues
 to
 grow
 from
 there.
 So,
 I


think
 the
 market
 just
 wants
 a
 lot
 of


that
 RPL
 to
 be
 more
 frontr
 run,
 but


Oracle
 can't
 do
 that.
 It's
 all
 about


data
 center
 being
 built
 up
 and
 they're


just
 building
 that
 data
 center
 to
 help


the
 revenue.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 market
 is


just
 hoping
 for
 that
 and
 yes,
 the
 debt


obviously
 plays
 a
 big
 role.
 Um,
 but
 I


think
 Larry
 uh
 counter
 back
 if
 I
 was


reading
 the
 transcript
 and
 and
 he


mentions
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 analysts


that
 believe
 Oracle
 needs
 to
 raise
 over


a hundred
 billion
 dollars
 to
 fund
 this


and
 they
 said
 we
 don't
 need
 a hundred


billion
 nowhere
 near
 that
 to
 fund
 uh
 to


to
 raise
 to
 be
 able
 to
 fund
 it.


Obviously,
 they're
 probably
 going
 to


raise
 maybe
 like
 50
 to
 60.
 Um
 but
 he


believes
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 analysts


are
 expect
 are
 are are
 thinking
 they


have
 to
 raise
 too
 much
 money.
 Um
 and


that
 could
 be
 an
 upside
 in
 the
 future.


Okay,
 Broadcom.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 the
 reason


they're
 down
 today,
 well,
 I'm
 curious


what
 why
 do
 you
 think
 they're
 down?
 And


do
 you
 think
 it's
 because
 of
 uh
 the
 lack


of
 OpenAI
 revenue
 coming
 in
 2026,
 which


is
 kind
 of
 consistent
 with
 Nvidia
 that


says
 we
 don't
 really
 have
 a
 definitive


agreement.
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 Broadcom


took
 the
 hit
 today?


>> Yeah,
 to
 be
 honest,
 I
 I
 I
 actually


posted
 yesterday
 because
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


feel
 like
 Broadcom's
 becoming
 a
 very


popular
 stock.
 Uh,
 I
 honestly
 did
 not


listen
 to
 the
 Aries
 call
 just
 yet.
 Um
 I


so
 I
 haven't
 have
 too
 much
 information


to
 add
 there.
 Um
 I
 wouldn't
 think
 OpenAI


um
 would
 be
 much
 of
 a
 fear.
 Um
 because
 I


I
 they
 did
 announce
 Anthropic
 is
 a
 big


customer
 now
 with
 the
 TPUs
 and
 and


Brockcom
 and
 Google.
 Uh
 so
 that's
 that.


Then
 obviously
 Google
 is
 still
 doing


pretty
 well.
 I
 think
 now
 the
 fear
 is


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I I
 don't
 think
 I
 can


give
 you
 any
 any
 any
 added
 value
 here
 on


Brockham
 right
 now
 as
 I
 haven't
 read
 the


earnings.
 Um
 but
 it's
 just
 I
 I
 mean
 if


you
 just
 look
 at
 that
 year
 to
 date
 year


to
 date
 the
 stock
 has
 done
 amazing.
 It


could
 just
 be
 as
 simple
 as
 maybe
 it
 just


ran
 up
 too
 much
 on
 excitement.
 Um
 and


and
 we're
 just
 pulling
 back
 a
 little
 bit


but
 I
 think
 Broadcom
 investors
 are
 still


pretty
 pretty
 happy
 for
 the
 year.


>> I
 think
 that's
 probably
 the
 best
 reason.


I
 mean
 this
 thing
 was
 up
 80%
 year
 to


date
 and
 they
 said
 a
 couple
 things
 on


the
 call
 that
 whenever
 you
 get
 a
 chance


to
 listen
 to
 Yeah.
 not
 the
 most


exciting,
 not
 bearish,
 but
 definitely


not
 perfect.
 And
 when
 you're
 trading
 at


the
 multiple
 they
 were
 trading
 at,
 you


got
 to
 be
 perfect.
 Like
 Nvidia,
 they
 had


to
 be
 perfect.
 They
 were
 perfect.
 Market


still
 didn't
 care.
 Broadcom
 wasn't


perfect.
 Obviously,
 the
 market's
 going


to
 care
 to
 the
 downside.
 So,


>> yeah.
 I
 I
 I
 wonder,
 right,
 what
 is
 this


company
 worth
 now?
 Two
 trillion.
 Is
 it


two
 trillion?


>> 1.7.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 Nvidia
 worth
 at


what?
 4
 point.
 What
 is
 Nvidia
 at
 right


now?
 If
 you


>> 4.2


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 They
 mentioned
 a
 backlog
 of
 about


72
 billion
 they
 mentioned
 right
 I
 think


it
 was
 72
 and
 then
 if
 you
 look
 at
 Nvidia


they
 have
 a
 backlog
 of
 not
 500
 billion
 a


little
 bit
 less
 than
 that
 probably
 still


about
 400
 billion
 remaining
 um
 so
 I


guess
 just
 by
 looking
 at
 the
 backlog
 you


can
 say
 am
 I
 really
 needing
 to
 value


this
 at
 should
 I
 value
 this
 maybe
 a


little
 bit
 cheaper
 than
 it
 is
 right
 now


just
 because
 the
 RPO
 multiples
 aren't


the
 same
 um
 on
 those
 uh
 but
 but
 yeah
 I


think
 overall
 I
 mean
 the
 demand
 for
 ASIC


is
 still
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 grow.
 Uh


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 they
 have
 that
 big


customer
 with
 Google
 and
 they're
 doing


really
 well
 with
 it.
 There's
 actually


even
 rumors
 that
 um
 they
 might
 have
 even


won
 some
 Amazon
 as
 well.
 I
 don't
 know if


that
 was
 confirmed
 or
 denied
 during
 the


earnings
 call,
 but
 um
 the
 compute
 is


still
 extremely
 high.
 I
 mean,
 we've
 seen


so
 many
 partnerships
 with
 OpenAI
 and


Enthropic
 just
 in
 the
 past
 five
 days


that
 show
 that
 AI
 compute
 is
 not
 slowing


down.


More
 importantly,
 Chris
 became
 extremely


bullish
 on
 on
 on
 AI,
 it
 seems.
 That's


why
 we
 freaking
 fell
 today.
 Freaking


Chris
 buying
 Nvidia.
 It's
 should
 have


known.
 Should
 have
 known
 that
 was
 the


No.
 So,
 what
 is
 your
 general
 sentiment


on
 AI
 right
 now,
 Jose?
 Because
 um


Nvidia's
 multiple
 continues
 to
 look


ridiculous.
 Uh
 Broadcom
 was
 expensive,


came
 back
 to
 reality
 a
 little
 bit.


Oracle
 probably
 never
 deserved
 to
 be
 at


350.
 It's
 at
 189.
 That's
 not
 crazy.


Still
 15%
 year
 to
 date.
 I
 mean,
 is
 there


been
 the
 Neo
 clouds
 are
 obviously
 are


getting
 hit.
 Uh,
 OpenAI
 is
 intimately


tied
 with
 Cororeweave,
 which
 is
 why
 I


think
 the
 headline
 with
 with
 Oracle
 and


OpenAI
 took
 Cororeweave
 down.
 But
 has


anything
 changed
 for
 you?
 It's
 kind
 of


just
 the
 market's
 tired
 of
 this
 trade


and
 that's
 why
 we're
 consolidated.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 for
 me
 it's
 it's
 a


buy
 the
 dip
 moments,
 right?
 I
 think
 the


AI
 ecosystem,
 the
 AI
 story
 is
 still
 much


intact.


I
 I
 understand
 why
 the
 market
 is
 scared,


right?
 I
 mean
 I
 don't
 think
 most
 people


follow
 this
 market
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 like


like
 me
 and
 and
 able
 to
 have
 like
 these


diamond
 hands
 that
 I
 have.
 Um
 and
 I
 mean


on
 the
 optics
 look
 scary.
 It's
 like
 we


don't
 know
 where
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 go.
 You


hear
 about
 delays.
 Does
 that
 delay
 is
 it


is
 the
 delay
 something
 talking
 about
 the


financing
 which
 we
 keep
 hearing
 about
 is


is
 this
 financial
 bubble
 is
 it
 about


demand?
 So
 when
 you
 hear
 just
 the
 story


like
 that
 it
 just
 creates
 a
 whole
 fear


of
 throughout
 the
 whole
 ecosystem.
 Um


but
 I
 think
 I
 mean
 for
 me
 I
 I
 I


definitely
 am
 not
 worried
 about
 anything


from
 demand
 uh
 from
 financing
 uh


Nvidia's
 especially
 on
 Nvidia's
 part.
 I


mean
 the
 customers
 that
 are
 buying
 from


there
 it's
 not
 just
 Oracle
 right
 it's


your
 Microsoft
 it's
 your
 Google
 is
 your


Amazon
 and
 all
 of
 them
 are
 saying
 the


exact
 same
 thing
 about
 a
 month
 ago
 that


demand
 is
 still
 growing
 they
 still
 want


to
 continue
 to
 grow
 their
 market
 share.


um
 Anthropic
 and
 Google
 and
 and
 Open
 AI


this
 week
 announced
 various
 partnerships


with
 enterprise
 companies.
 I
 think
 open


AAI
 announced
 something
 with
 Disney


which
 can
 be
 seen
 like
 AI
 slot
 coming
 to


the
 overall
 platform
 but
 more
 kids
 are


going
 to
 be
 just
 using
 AI
 in
 general.


More
 parents
 are
 going
 to
 be
 using
 more


AI.
 I
 do
 also
 think
 that's
 a
 uh
 it


creates
 a
 domino
 effect
 for
 other


creative
 enterprises
 to
 say
 look
 we


can't
 be
 left
 behind.
 If
 Disney
 is
 doing


this
 with
 them,
 why
 shouldn't
 we
 should


also
 go
 partner
 up
 with
 maybe
 not
 open


AI
 but
 with
 some
 AI
 company
 because
 we


need
 to
 have
 that
 same
 type
 of


technology.
 Open
 AI
 also
 partner
 up
 with


anthropic
 partner
 up
 with
 Accenture
 uh
 I


think
 a
 few
 days
 ago.
 So
 enterprise
 are


the
 people
 that
 have
 the
 big
 money.


They're
 the
 ones
 that
 have
 those
 uh


people
 on
 on
 computers
 eight
 hours
 a


day.
 Comput
 is
 going
 to
 continue
 to


grow.
 Um
 you
 saw
 El
 Salvador
 also
 kind


of
 announced
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 be


using
 uh
 Grock.
 More
 countries
 uh
 I
 I


know
 El
 Salvador
 has
 been
 very
 popular


lately
 and
 more
 countries
 are
 going
 to


be
 like
 if
 El
 Salvador
 is
 doing
 this


maybe
 we
 should
 also
 think
 about
 doing


this
 because
 um
 we
 can't
 be
 left
 behind.


So
 I
 think
 the
 demand
 for
 AI
 compute


continues
 to
 grow.
 So
 I'm
 not
 worried
 at


all
 about
 this
 AI
 sell-off.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 agree
 with
 that
 as
 well.


If
 the
 demand
 for
 AI
 compute
 continues


to
 grow
 and
 what
 we've
 seen
 from
 every


earnings,
 which
 is
 undeniable,
 you
 you


can
 hate
 the
 multiple
 some
 of
 these


stocks
 were
 trading
 at
 like
 a
 Broadcom,


you
 cannot
 deny
 they
 had
 a
 great


quarter.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Nvidia.


Nvidia's
 multiple
 a
 little
 bit
 better


than
 Broadcom's.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Oracle.


Maybe
 their
 multiple
 and
 their
 debt
 load


not
 exciting,
 but
 they
 put
 up
 a
 good


quarter.
 Uh
 so
 I
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a
 fair


point
 that
 S&P
 is
 up
 basically
 20%
 this


year.
 stocks
 in
 including
 the
 most


important
 companies
 on
 the
 planet
 have


put
 up
 like
 all
 the
 hyperscalers
 all
 the


max
 put
 up
 very
 strong
 earnings
 but
 also


it's
 like
 all
 right
 from
 the
 liberation


day
 lows
 forget
 year
 to
 date
 a
 lot
 of


these
 I
 mean
 Nvidia
 is
 a
 double
 from
 the


April
 lows
 you
 know
 at
 at
 180
 175
 so


it's
 like
 it's
 like
 as
 much
 as
 we
 think


it
 probably
 should
 get
 a
 higher
 multiple


if
 we're
 assuming
 that
 growth
 rate


continues
 if
 it's
 not
 it's
 also
 like
 all


right
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is
 um
 I'm
 I'm


curious
 about
 your
 thoughts
 on
 this
 as


well
 so
 China's
 opening
 up
 for
 Nvidia.


Nvidia
 said,
 "We're
 happy
 that
 Trump
 is


allowing
 us
 to
 sell."
 Uh,
 some
 articles


came
 out
 this
 morning
 that
 said
 Chinese


firms
 are
 basically
 begging
 the
 CCP
 to


allow
 them
 to
 to
 buy
 some
 Nvidia
 chips.


Do
 you
 think
 this
 is
 a
 tailwind
 or
 do


you
 think
 this
 ends
 up
 being
 a
 nothing


burger
 for
 them?


>> Um,
 I
 I
 think
 for
 Vidia,
 it's
 definitely


a
 tailwind.
 I
 mean,
 uh,
 Jensen
 has


mentioned
 in
 the
 past
 that
 this
 is
 a
 50


billion
 opportunity
 for
 them
 um,
 per


year
 and
 not
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 the


revenue,
 it's
 also
 just
 about
 the


overall
 ecosystem.
 uh
 we've
 heard
 that
 a


lot
 of
 AI
 developers
 just
 actually
 ends


up
 coming
 from
 from
 China.
 So
 you
 want


to
 make
 sure
 that
 your
 developer


ecosystem
 continues
 to
 grow.
 Um
 I
 I
 I
 I


think
 in
 forms
 of
 numbers
 is
 a
 tailwind.


In
 forms
 of
 the
 market
 though
 it
 becomes


a
 headwind
 in
 the
 future
 because
 now


once
 it
 gets
 approved
 um
 and
 once
 we


start
 to
 sell
 start
 this
 we
 start
 to


sell
 selling
 over
 here
 we're
 going
 to


start
 to
 see
 reports
 uh
 potentially


China
 um
 potentially
 United
 States
 is


going
 to
 cancel
 this
 deal.
 Potentially


China
 is
 not
 going
 to
 take
 them
 and
 it's


going
 to
 create
 this
 volatility
 in
 the


overall
 market.
 Um,
 so
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 a


tailwind,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 tailwind


that's
 going to
 come
 with
 the


double-edged
 sword
 that
 uh
 the
 media
 and


other
 players
 uh
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 seem


like
 a
 conspiracy
 theorist,
 but
 it's


just
 it
 it's
 headlines
 get
 clicks
 and


scary
 headlines
 get
 the
 best
 clicks.
 So


if
 you
 ever
 have
 just
 like
 with
 this


Oracle
 thing,
 um
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 my


next
 question.
 What
 was
 what
 was
 your


perspective
 on
 that
 when
 it
 came
 out


>> on
 which
 one?
 My
 apologies


>> on
 on
 OpenAI
 delaying
 a
 data
 center


theoretically
 with
 Oracle.
 Yeah,
 I
 I I


mean
 and
 I
 I
 thought
 the
 market
 was


funny,
 right?
 If
 Oracle
 code
 delays
 uh


well,
 we
 saw
 that
 it
 was
 false
 or
 or


they
 they
 dispute
 the
 fact.
 Um


>> but
 first
 I
 understand
 why
 the
 overall


ecosystem
 fails
 like
 again
 you
 I
 think


you
 mentioned
 it.
 It's
 like
 it
 it's


either
 means
 someone
 has
 slow
 demand,


someone's
 not
 able
 to
 finance
 and
 it


just
 trickles
 down
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the


ecosystem.
 If
 Oracle
 though,
 in
 my


opinion,
 the
 way
 I
 see,
 if
 Oracle
 can't


meet
 the
 compute
 because
 they
 slowed


down
 on
 some
 form
 of
 data
 center,
 it
 has


to
 trickle
 down
 to
 someone
 else.
 Open


AAI,
 if
 they
 really
 need
 the
 compute,


they're
 not
 going
 to
 wait.
 They're
 going


to
 say,
 "Oh,
 maybe
 I
 have
 to
 go
 buy
 it


from
 Nebus,
 from
 Corwe,
 from
 iron,
 from


someone
 else,
 from
 or
 from
 Amazon,


right?
 So,
 I
 thought
 the
 market
 was


pretty
 funny
 because
 if
 it's
 a
 slowdown


for
 Oracle,
 that
 demand
 needs
 to
 go


somewhere
 else."
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 found


that
 the
 whole
 market
 kind
 of
 going


down.
 Um,
 sometimes
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's


funny.
 Uh,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 true.
 Um,


and
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 anything
 with


compute.
 Oracle
 just
 had
 earnings
 two


days
 ago
 or
 three
 days
 ago.
 And
 they


mentioned
 that
 their
 guidance
 for
 OCI


for
 2027,


fiscal
 year
 2027s,
 which
 is
 about
 two


quarters
 ahead
 of
 calendar
 year
 is
 up.


Why
 would
 they
 have
 done
 that
 if
 they


expect
 some
 form
 of
 delays?
 Why
 would


they
 kind
 of
 create
 some
 form
 of
 fear
 if


they
 had
 some
 form
 of
 delays?
 But


instead
 they
 actually
 upped
 their


guidance
 for
 next
 year.
 Um
 so
 I
 mean
 the


data
 was
 right
 there
 I
 if
 in
 my
 opinion


>> and
 and
 capex
 was
 still
 high.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 they
 increased
 their
 capex


guidance
 as
 well
 by
 15
 billion.
 I
 I


think
 the
 market's
 just
 tired
 of
 the
 AI


trade
 right
 now,
 right?
 Like
 and
 I
 think


I
 think
 you're
 probably
 feeling
 it
 as


well.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 us
 are
 feeling
 it


that
 you
 know
 the
 market's
 given
 a
 lot


of these
 names
 a
 multiple.
 A
 name
 like
 a


Nebius.
 A
 Corby
 is
 still
 up
 but
 double


from
 IPO.
 IPOed
 at
 40.
 It's
 basically
 at


80,
 right?
 Neb
 is
 up
 like
 2.2x
 or


something.
 So
 yeah,
 these
 names
 are
 not


at
 alltime
 highs,
 but
 they've
 definitely


made
 a
 move.
 It
 is
 now
 their
 job
 to
 keep


executing
 to
 prove
 they
 deserve
 their


multiple.
 But
 are
 do
 you
 think
 the


market's
 just
 a
 little
 tired
 of
 the
 AI


trade
 and
 maybe
 that's
 where,
 you
 know,


you
 get
 some
 consolidation
 towards
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.


>> I
 I
 I
 think
 more
 fearful
 than
 anything,


it's
 just,
 hey,
 we
 just
 had
 this
 massive


drop.
 A
 lot
 of
 these
 stocks
 I
 I
 I
 think


right
 um
 Nebia's
 dropped
 from
 like
 120.


core
 we've
 dropped
 from
 like
 140s.
 A
 lot


of
 these
 were
 are
 down
 probably
 still
 30


or
 40%
 and
 it's
 like
 during
 this
 time


frame
 everybody's
 scarce
 like
 uh
 any
 any


little
 noise
 it's
 like
 they
 they
 they


still
 have
 PTSD
 from
 from
 just
 a
 month


ago
 and
 it
 creates
 that
 negative


sentiment.
 Um


>> and
 I
 mean
 Cororee
 unfortunately
 didn't


do
 much
 help
 to
 it
 when
 they
 reported


earnings.
 They
 mentioned
 that
 they
 had


some
 delays
 on
 the
 data
 center
 side
 but


it
 was
 more
 of
 like
 just
 the


construction
 aspect.
 It
 had
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 demand.
 Uh
 but
 the
 market
 likes


to
 run
 with
 it.
 So
 unfortunately
 I
 think


we
 need
 a
 a
 quarter
 where
 like
 everybody


is
 perfect
 where
 everybody
 that
 reports


says
 look
 this
 is
 good
 good
 good.
 Um
 to


kind
 of
 maybe
 turn
 that
 sentiment
 but
 I


I
 I
 think
 it's
 yeah
 I
 think
 everybody's


tired.
 I
 think
 everybody
 has
 that
 fear


of
 oh
 I
 dropped
 40%.
 It's
 going
 to
 drop


another
 20%
 from
 here.
 Um,
 let
 me
 get


off
 before
 uh
 emotions
 are
 high
 on
 the


fearful
 side
 for
 AI
 investors
 right
 now


except
 for
 me.


>> Okay,
 so
 my
 last
 question
 for
 you
 and


guys
 Jose's
 YouTube
 and
 Twitter.
 I'll


put
 in
 the
 chat.
 You
 can
 follow
 him


there.
 Uh,
 yeah,
 I
 guess
 simple
 last


question.
 Why
 why
 don't
 you
 have
 any


fear?


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 it's


I
 think
 mainly
 it's
 just
 because
 of
 of


my
 workflow.
 I
 continue
 to
 use
 more
 AI


on
 a
 daily
 basis.


I've
 c
 even
 I
 I
 come
 from
 an
 engineering


background,
 so
 I
 do
 have
 some
 tech


stuff,
 but
 I've
 created
 like
 small
 apps


that
 I
 use
 on
 my
 computer
 now
 that
 I
 I


wasn't
 able
 to
 do
 back
 then.
 Even
 with


like
 the
 knowledge
 that
 I
 had,
 but
 with


AI,
 I'm
 able
 to
 do
 this
 stuff
 in
 like


minutes
 um
 in
 in
 hours,
 I'm
 able
 to


create
 some
 crazy
 things.
 I
 I
 talked
 to


friends.
 One
 of
 my
 friends
 is
 actually


trying
 to
 um
 start
 a
 business
 and
 I
 I


went
 over
 his
 house
 a
 few
 a
 few
 days
 ago


and
 he
 he
 showed
 me
 how
 like
 he's


incorporating
 AI
 so
 much
 into
 this
 and


it's
 like
 it
 just
 blows
 my
 mind
 how
 much


how
 much
 AI
 is
 growing
 in
 real
 use


cases.
 Uh
 I
 sometimes
 do
 some
 form
 of


freelance
 for
 for
 various
 companies
 and


again
 the
 amount
 of
 AI
 work
 I
 see
 is


wild.
 So
 to
 me
 it's
 just
 real
 data
 um


from
 kind
 of
 boots
 in
 the
 ground
 that


show
 me
 that
 this
 AI
 story
 is
 not
 going


anywhere.
 And
 then
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 these


companies
 right
 some
 of
 them
 might
 have


some
 crazy
 valuations
 but
 Nvidia
 at
 a


forward
 PE
 ratio
 of
 like
 what
 maybe


mid20s
 right
 now
 if
 that
 uh
 the
 Amazon


um
 Meta
 like
 they're
 not
 that
 crazy.


They've
 turned
 a
 bit
 around
 but


valuations
 aren't
 scaring
 me
 for
 for
 a


lot
 of
 these
 players.
 And
 then
 for
 my


yellow,
 not
 my
 yellow
 players,
 but
 for


like
 my
 ones
 that
 I
 think
 are
 going
 to


are
 going
 to
 make
 big
 money
 for
 me
 like


Cororey,
 like
 the
 demand
 for
 compute


continues
 to
 grow
 and
 the
 and
 these
 are


players
 that
 are
 building
 that
 massive


AI
 infrastructure.
 Um,
 so
 yeah,
 it's


just
 I
 think
 boots
 on
 the
 ground
 data.


I
 think
 that's
 fair
 and
 I
 think


anecdotally
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 are


actually
 using
 AI
 every
 day
 and
 sort
 of


seeing
 the
 the
 technical
 aspects
 of
 not


only
 model
 improvement
 but
 how
 the


application
 of
 those
 models
 are
 leading


to
 actual
 productivity
 gains
 in
 their


own
 life.
 That's
 a
 big
 deal.
 And
 then


when
 we
 get
 the
 evidence
 around,
 you


know,
 the
 earnings
 growth
 and
 the
 data


center
 growth,
 it's
 hard
 to


fundamentally
 deny
 it
 as
 like
 a
 a
 fad
 as


some
 would
 say.
 Um,
 okay.
 Actual
 last


question
 for
 you,
 Jose.
 We're
 we're


getting
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 2025.
 So,
 if


you
 had
 to
 give
 me
 three
 of
 your
 top
 AI


convictions
 for
 next
 year,
 what
 would


those
 three
 be
 at
 this
 point?


>> Uh,
 Nvidia
 for
 sure,
 especially
 at
 these


levels.
 This
 one,
 even
 though
 a
 $4


trillion
 company,
 I
 could
 see
 this
 being


a
 massive
 player.
 So,
 Nvidia
 for
 sure.


Um,
 number
 two,
 Core
 Weef.
 I
 believe


Core
 is
 and
 and
 it's
 crazy
 to
 think
 I


always
 hate
 when
 I
 say
 Cororeef
 because


many
 people
 think
 I
 hate
 the
 other


players.
 I
 don't.
 I
 think
 the
 whole


Neocloud
 ecosystem
 is
 going
 to
 do
 great.


I
 just
 prefer
 core
 the
 most
 because
 they


have
 the
 biggest
 AI
 infrastructure
 out


there
 over
 about
 600
 of
 active
 power.


They're
 like
 best
 buddies
 with
 with


Jensen
 and
 Nvidia.
 Uh
 so
 so
 Cororeef
 is


my
 second.
 Um
 and
 I
 have
 to
 stay
 with


the
 third.
 For
 me
 the
 third
 I
 guess
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 with
 AMD.
 AMD
 is
 that
 one


that's
 like
 a
 $200
 billion
 uh
 what's
 I


forget
 the
 market
 cap
 probably
 like
 350


right
 now.
 And
 if
 they
 do
 reach
 those


earnings
 per
 share
 potential
 of
 $20


within
 the
 next
 two
 to
 five
 years,


that's
 a
 trillion
 dollar
 company
 easily.


Uh
 so
 those
 are
 my
 three
 favorite
 plays.


It
 doesn't
 mean
 I
 hate
 other


semiconductor
 stocks.
 And
 I'm
 sorry
 to


the
 viewers
 if
 I
 didn't
 mention
 yours.


Don't
 hate
 me.
 Uh
 but
 in
 general,
 I


think
 AI
 chip
 companies.
 I
 think
 the


NeoCloud
 players
 are
 still
 going
 to
 do


very
 very
 well
 um
 in
 2026.


>> All
 right.
 I
 love
 it.
 Jose,
 thank
 you


for
 joining
 on
 this
 Friday.
 Have
 a
 great


weekend.
 We'll
 talk
 to
 you
 next
 week.


>> Thank
 you.
 You
 too,
 brother.


>> Later.


All right,
 folks.
 That's
 what
 we
 got


from
 Mr.
 Jose.
 I
 do
 not
 think
 Steve
 is


joining
 today.
 I
 think
 Steve
 is
 wrapped


up
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 meetings
 today.


So,
 yeah,
 we're
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 be


hearing
 from
 him.
 I
 don't
 even
 think,


quite
 frankly,
 Steve
 even
 saw
 what


happened
 to
 the
 market
 today.
 He's
 been


texting
 me
 pictures
 of
 his
 lunch
 all


day.
 So,


the
 other
 thing
 he
 texted
 me
 about
 was


this
 freaking
 OC
 news
 for
 XRP


because
 for
 some
 reason
 he
 still
 loves


XRP
 even
 though
 he
 doesn't
 buy
 any
 it


any
 any
 more
 XRP.
 But
 yeah,
 outside
 of


that,
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 cared
 too
 much


about
 this
 decline
 today
 on
 Oracle.


Again,
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 it
 was
 a


little
 bit
 weird
 because
 last
 night


alltime
 highs
 on
 the
 S&P,
 then
 this


morning
 we're
 doing
 okay
 and
 then
 boom,


Broadcom
 bottom
 falls
 out.
 Open
 AI
 news


comes
 out
 with
 Oracle.
 Oracle
 denies
 it.


market
 recovers
 and
 the
 market
 says,


"You
 know what?
 We
 actually
 don't


believe
 it."
 And
 you
 end
 up
 just
 getting


a
 1%
 down
 on
 the
 S&P.
 Not
 to
 mention,


it's
 a
 Friday.
 So,
 there's
 tons
 of


options
 that
 expired
 today
 and
 probably


had
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 stuff
 going
 on


with
 market
 makers.


And
 that's
 pretty
 much
 what
 we
 had.
 He


was
 on
 with
 Tanner.
 Okay.
 He
 was


probably
 on
 with
 Tanner
 then
 during
 the


the
 uh
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day.


He
 probably
 did.
 He
 said
 like
 his
 his


his
 company
 like
 ordered
 lunch
 for


everybody,
 but
 he
 used
 it
 as
 an
 excuse


to
 go
 get
 his
 own
 lunch
 because
 they


like
 canceled
 a
 bunch
 of
 meetings


because
 they
 all
 ordered
 lunch
 at
 his


office
 and
 he
 went
 straight
 to
 Paty's
 to


uh
 to
 get
 his
 meatballs.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 call
 Steve.
 I
 already


sent
 him
 the
 link.
 I
 already
 texted
 him.


I
 said
 if
 you're
 free,
 you
 can
 hop
 on.


If
 not,
 it's
 okay.
 But
 he's
 probably


stuck
 in
 those
 meetings
 that
 the
 company


canceled
 during
 lunch.
 and
 now
 he's


there
 after
 hours.
 So,
 if
 he's
 free,


he'll
 let
 me
 know.
 If
 not,
 then
 uh
 he'll


be
 live
 tonight.
 Also,
 that
 was
 we
 were


live
 together
 for
 two
 hours
 yesterday.


So,


Tanner
 called
 him
 for
 like
 two
 minutes.


Okay,
 that
 makes
 sense.


Usually
 Fridays
 tend
 to
 be
 a
 little
 busy


for
 him.
 Um


yeah,
 I
 mean,
 Mr.
 Tick,
 no
 crying
 at
 the


casino.
 There
 is
 no
 crying
 in
 the


casino.
 Again,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 thing


that
 really
 surprised
 me
 today
 had


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the
 markets.
 It
 was


this
 Tom
 Lee
 podcast.


It
 was
 this
 freaking
 Tom
 Lee
 podcast,


dude.
 I
 mean,
 you
 guys
 can
 listen
 to


your
 listen
 to
 it
 again.
 I
 just
 I
 I
 this


was
 the
 because
 look,
 what's
 his
 name?


Uh
 Scott
 Galloway
 had
 Osweeks
 ago
 and
 he


was
 straight
 up
 bearish.
 He
 was


basically
 like
 sell
 everything.
 It's


over.
 Got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 scared
 and


then
 we
 went
 down.
 We
 recovered.
 hit


alltime
 highs
 yesterday.
 Then
 Tom


Leehop's
 on
 the
 same
 podcast
 and
 he's


like,
 "Yeah,
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 be


okay
 next
 year,
 but
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 go
 through
 some
 real
 pain
 before


we're
 okay."
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 what


does
 that
 mean?
 20%
 down."
 I'm
 like,


"Okay,
 so
 where's
 the
 target?
 40%
 up


after
 20%."
 I'm
 like,
 "So,
 what
 what
 do


we
 what
 what
 are
 you
 saying?"
 Like,


genuinely,
 what
 is
 the
 argument
 here?


It's
 it's
 just
 confusing
 to
 me
 because
 I


don't
 know
 how
 realistic
 it
 is
 for
 the


thesis
 play.
 If
 that
 look,
 if
 we
 have
 a


20%
 draw
 down,
 small
 caps
 obliterated,


financials
 obliterated,
 uh,
 crypto


obliterated.
 Like
 all
 of
 his
 picks
 that


he's
 excited
 about
 next
 year,
 they're


gone.
 If
 you
 have a
 20%
 draw
 down,


everything's
 gone
 if
 you
 have
 a
 20%.
 I


mean,
 Verizon
 might
 be
 okay.


But


Tom
 also
 thinks
 the
 Supreme
 Court


decision
 on
 tariffs
 will
 cause


disruption
 next
 year.
 I
 think
 he
 said


that
 yesterday
 on
 CNBC.
 So,
 yes,
 I
 mean,


that's
 another
 that
 and
 the
 freaking


shutdown,
 those
 two
 coming
 together


could
 be
 an
 issue.
 And
 then


unfortunately
 those
 poly
 market
 odds


about
 um


the
 shutdown.
 By
 the
 way,
 Trump
 is
 not


live
 right
 now.
 I
 think
 he
 might
 be
 live


later,
 but
 he's
 not
 live
 right
 now.
 The


shutdown
 odds
 they
 increased
 today.


And
 yeah,
 right
 now
 they're
 at
 40%.


And
 that's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 good.


That's
 not
 something
 that
 we
 need
 to


see.
 The
 weed
 stocks
 were
 safe,
 though.


weed
 stocks
 went
 higher
 today,


dude.
 Like,
 we
 cannot
 have
 a
 shutdown


going
 into
 because
 because
 remember
 the


first
 shutdown,
 the
 one
 that
 we
 had
 like


a
 month
 ago,
 I
 mean,
 economists
 are


saying
 2%
 of
 GDP
 got
 wiped
 out
 with


that.
 We
 we
 cannot
 afford
 with
 the
 debt


we
 have
 and
 the
 deficit
 we
 have
 to
 have


another
 2%
 on
 GDP
 get
 hit.


Also,
 we
 have
 the
 jobs
 data
 next
 week,


so
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 important.
 Now
 the


jobs
 data
 being
 see
 here's
 the
 issue


now.
 Let's
 say
 jobs
 data
 is
 bad.
 There's


no
 more
 rate
 cut
 catalyst
 because
 the


rate
 cut
 happened.
 So
 it's
 not
 like
 bad


news
 is
 good
 news
 anymore.
 Bad
 news


might
 just
 be
 bad
 news.
 Now
 people
 might


say
 oh
 we'll
 get another
 rate
 cut
 in


January.
 Maybe
 maybe
 that's
 where
 the


narrative
 is
 like
 okay
 more
 really
 bad


jobs
 data
 means
 even
 more
 rate
 cuts.


Right
 now
 January
 is
 pricing
 in
 a
 25%


chance
 of
 a
 rate
 cut.


But
 it
 might
 more
 so
 just
 be
 bad
 news
 is


bad
 news
 which
 is
 okay.
 We
 already
 know


the
 labor
 market's
 bad.
 So,
 it's
 like


you
 can't
 avoid
 that
 data
 being
 bad
 and


the
 Fed
 probably
 knows
 it
 as
 well,
 too,


which
 is
 why
 they
 cut
 this
 week,


but
 that
 could
 end
 up
 being
 the
 next


catalyst.
 It
 just
 will
 take
 a
 month


before
 we
 see
 if
 we
 get
 that
 rate
 up.


Yeah.
 Trump
 said
 Kevin
 Worsh
 has
 moved


to
 the
 top
 of
 his
 list,
 though
 Kevin


Hassid
 also
 remains
 in
 contention.


I
 mean,
 Worsh
 would
 be
 the
 safe
 pick


because
 the
 street
 loves
 him.
 Uh
 Wars


actually
 interviewed
 Alex
 Karp
 if
 you


guys
 remember
 that
 was
 back
 in
 January


of
 2022.
 But
 um
 Hassid
 would
 be
 loyal.


So
 I
 think
 Trump's
 got
 to
 figure
 out
 who


does
 he
 want
 here?
 Someone
 who
 he
 knows


is
 going
 to
 cut
 rates
 or
 someone
 who
 he


knows
 is
 dovish
 enough
 to
 cut
 rates
 but


might
 not
 explicitly


end
 up
 cutting
 those
 rates.
 Yeah.
 And


then
 going
 back
 to
 this
 Tom
 Lee
 20%
 draw


down
 thesis,
 we
 got
 the
 midterms
 coming


up.
 uh
 we
 get
 a
 20%
 draw
 down
 and
 if


that's
 anywhere
 near
 and
 not
 get
 a
 40%


recovery
 as
 Tom
 Lee
 is
 saying
 going
 into


the
 end
 of
 2026
 November
 which
 is
 when


we
 have
 midterms


I
 don't
 know
 if
 people
 lose
 20%
 of
 their


retirement
 accounts
 they
 might
 not
 be


the
 happiest
 going
 into
 midterms.


So
 there
 are
 some
 I
 think
 broader


concerns


on
 that
 entire
 thesis,


but
 I'm
 curious
 about
 what
 other


analysts
 have
 to
 say,
 right?
 Like
 so


this
 is
 funds
 perspective.
 I'm
 really


curious
 about
 like
 what
 does
 Morgan


Stanley
 say?
 Mike
 Wilson
 has
 been
 pretty


damn
 bullish
 and
 I
 I
 think
 his
 take


might
 be
 a
 bit
 different
 in
 terms
 of
 how


it
 plays
 out,
 but
 still
 on
 the
 same


track
 record
 of
 maintaining
 a
 bullish


view.
 And
 again,
 my
 perspective
 is
 very


simple.
 Fed
 easing,
 AI
 trade
 intact.
 You


put
 those
 two
 together,
 you
 get
 a
 bull


market.
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 10%
 up,
 20%


up,
 14%
 up,


you
 know,
 11%
 up,
 which
 is
 still
 a
 great


return
 after
 three
 years
 of
 20%.
 But
 I


don't
 see
 those
 two
 collapsing
 next


year,
 especially
 with
 the
 new
 fetch


area.


Now,
 they're
 trying
 to
 collapse
 the
 AI


trade
 with
 every
 single
 headline
 every


other
 day.
 Uh,
 and
 we
 had
 that
 taste


that
 today
 with
 Oracle
 and
 OpenAI.
 But


if
 those
 two
 narratives
 stay
 intact,


then
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 be
 all
 right.


Uh
 Tom's
 hurting
 because
 of
 ETH.
 Well,


that's
 another
 thing,
 dude.
 That's
 I


think
 that's
 the
 other,
 you
 know,
 I
 I


said
 this
 when
 BMR
 was
 getting
 hit


pretty
 bad
 in
 November.


He
 got
 the
 timing
 of
 it
 dead
 wrong.


Regardless
 of
 what
 you
 want
 to
 say
 about


the
 thesis,
 which
 I
 think
 the
 thesis
 is


very
 real
 around
 stable
 coins,


tokenization,
 that
 stuff's
 only
 growing


and
 growing
 and
 growing.
 The
 timing
 of


it
 was
 dead
 wrong.
 So
 then
 the
 question


becomes,
 okay,
 if
 we're
 going to
 have
 a


meltdown
 as
 he's
 again,
 I'm
 not
 saying


we're
 getting
 a
 20%
 draw
 down.
 This
 is


him
 saying
 it.
 There
 is
 no
 way
 in
 hell


Ethereum
 holds
 up
 in
 a
 20%
 draw.
 That's


the
 first
 thing
 people
 will
 sell.
 So


then
 you
 can't
 logically
 be
 saying
 buy


BMR,
 buy
 Ethereum
 if
 you're
 Tom
 if


you're
 also
 simultaneously
 saying
 there


will
 be
 a
 20%
 draw
 down
 or
 get
 ready
 for


a
 20%
 draw
 down


and
 it's
 like
 let's
 say
 the
 20%
 draw


down
 is
 in
 June
 instead
 of
 January
 or
 so


like
 for
 those
 six
 months
 what
 would
 be


the
 value
 of
 buying
 ETH
 if
 I
 know
 it's


going
 to
 get
 nuked
 whenever
 the
 draw


down
 does
 happen
 which
 again
 is
 his


uh
 framework
 for
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 tough


job
 being
 an
 analyst
 it's
 not
 an
 That's


why
 you
 get
 all
 the
 praise
 if
 you're


right
 and
 you
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 blame
 if


you're
 wrong.
 It
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 But
 he's


been
 doing
 this
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 But
 if


you're
 going
 to
 put
 out
 a
 guy
 that
 says


we're
 going
 to
 go
 down
 20%
 and
 then
 say


buy
 a
 very
 speculative
 asset
 which
 has


some
 very
 real
 underpinnings
 and


foundational
 elements
 towards
 it
 around


um
 stable
 coins
 and
 tokenization,
 but
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 is
 still
 going
 to
 be


subject
 to
 a
 massive
 draw
 down
 because


it
 is
 in
 the
 world
 of
 crypto.
 You
 can't


logically
 say
 those
 two
 things
 like


they're
 just
 not
 consistent
 with
 each


other.


At
 least
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 imagine


that
 it's
 consistent
 with
 each
 other.


And
 so
 same
 thing
 with
 small
 cap.
 So


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 I
 if
 you
 believe
 in
 his


outlook,
 you
 can't
 really
 believe
 in


Ethereum
 from
 a
 price
 perspective.
 You


might
 believe
 in
 it
 for
 the
 next
 10


years.
 That's
 a
 different
 question.
 But


I
 think
 there
 maybe
 is
 a
 better


opportunity.


Um
 well
 that's
 a
 good
 point,
 Ver.
 He


didn't
 get
 things
 wrong.
 If
 you
 think
 he


needs
 prices
 to
 be
 high
 in
 order
 to


dilute
 to
 buy
 more
 Ethereum,
 wouldn't
 be


able
 to
 in
 a
 crypto
 winter,
 that
 is
 a


fair
 point.
 The
 problem
 is
 I
 feel
 like


he's
 sitting
 on
 four
 billion
 of
 losses


on
 ETH.
 So
 even
 if
 you
 let's
 say
 even
 if


in
 a
 crypto
 winter
 a
 DAT
 wouldn't
 have


worked,
 um
 you
 could
 probably
 still


launch
 it
 and
 it's
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


to
 the
 point
 where
 he
 could
 raise
 like
 I


don't
 know,
 I
 think
 he's
 raised
 like
 $15


billion
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 He


probably
 would
 have
 gotten
 able
 to
 buy


3%
 of
 all
 ETH,
 but
 he
 could
 have
 started


buying
 like
 maybe
 half
 a
 percent
 of
 ETH


in
 a
 crypto
 winter
 and
 then
 eventually


scaled
 it
 out
 of
 the
 crypto
 winter.
 But


then
 you
 have
 Tom
 saying,
 "I
 don't


believe
 in
 a
 crypto
 winter."
 He's


saying, "I
 don't
 believe
 in
 this


four-year
 cycle."
 So,
 which
 which
 we


should
 listen
 to
 that
 part
 of
 the
 the


pod
 as
 well.
 Um,


but
 yeah,
 there's
 a
 fair
 point
 which
 is


that
 you
 had
 to
 go
 through
 the
 pain
 of


raising
 that
 money
 when
 things
 were


high.
 It's
 just
 to
 be
 back
 holding
 it.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 the


strongest
 strategy
 to
 go
 from
 on


Ethereum.


He
 frightened
 people
 away
 because
 he


intends
 to
 purchase
 all
 the
 ETH
 himself.


Look,
 here's
 the
 other
 thing.
 Or
 just


don't
 launch
 a
 DAT.
 I
 mean,
 I
 said
 this


the
 day
 it
 launched
 and
 I
 still
 believe


this
 even
 though
 I'm
 long
 this,
 which
 is


I'm
 just
 thinking
 from
 a
 branding


perspective.
 Whenever
 you
 launch


something,
 the
 risk
 of
 it
 being


successful
 is
 now
 on
 your
 name.
 So


whether
 it's
 a
 Granny
 Shot
 ETF,
 whether


it's
 a
 a
 hedge
 fund,
 whatever
 it
 is,


like
 you
 take
 the
 risk
 of
 having
 it


work,
 especially
 if
 your
 public
 persona


is
 that
 big.
 Now,
 you
 got
 to
 risk
 some


things
 in
 life
 to
 be
 successful
 100.


like
 you
 have
 to
 go
 out
 on
 a
 limb
 and


take
 a
 risk.
 I
 go
 out
 on
 a
 limb
 every


morning
 and
 and
 and
 and
 and
 take
 a
 risk


with
 with with
 my
 jokes,
 which
 today


weren't
 as
 weren't
 as
 successful
 as
 this


morning,
 but
 nonetheless,
 you
 got
 to


try.
 But
 you
 also
 have
 to
 measure
 the


risk.
 Like
 a
 crypto
 digital
 asset


treasury
 only
 works
 in
 a
 raging
 bull


market
 that
 has
 global
 liquidity
 flowing


to
 these
 crypto
 assets.


So,
 if
 that
 was
 going
 to
 not
 necessarily


be
 the
 case,
 it's
 not
 the
 best
 risk
 to


take


unless
 you're
 just
 so
 bullish
 that
 it,


you
 know,
 Ethereum
 is
 going
 to
 play
 out.


But
 again,
 you
 know,
 JP
 Morg
 Jamie


Diamond
 himself
 could
 be
 like,
 I'm


buying
 a
 billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 ETH.


At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 it
 is
 a
 asset


tied
 to
 global
 liquidity,
 no
 matter
 who


gets
 super
 excited
 about
 it.
 Bitcoin
 was


up
 36%
 for
 the
 year
 and
 now
 it's


currently


I
 think
 it's
 like
 flat
 for
 the
 year.
 Um


so
 it
 lost
 a
 lot
 of
 its
 gains.


Uh
 I'm
 still
 very
 optimistic.
 Um
 because


crypto
 still
 has
 its
 best
 years
 ahead,


but
 crypto


should
 have
 had
 a
 good
 year
 this
 year


and
 it
 was
 on
 track
 to
 until
 there
 was
 a


liquidity
 crisis
 on
 October
 10th.


That
 was
 a
 bigger
 wipeout
 in
 terms
 of


liquidation
 than
 any
 event
 in
 history.


The
 most
 recent
 one
 before
 this
 would


have
 been
 2022
 with
 FTX.
 And
 that


wipeout
 pales
 in
 comparison
 to
 what


happened
 on
 October
 10th.
 But
 in
 2022,


it
 took
 eight
 weeks
 before
 crypto
 the


smoke
 cleared.
 The
 leverage
 wipeout
 was


enough
 in
 the
 mirror
 that
 that
 crypto


prices
 began
 to
 recover.
 This
 week
 is


the
 eighth
 week
 since
 that
 crisis.
 Um,


and
 I
 think
 crypto
 prices
 are
 beginning


to
 actually
 recover.
 Uh,
 that's
 why
 I


think
 Bitcoin
 can
 can
 double
 from
 here


by
 the
 end
 of
 January.
 Now,
 many
 people


don't
 expect
 it
 because
 of
 the
 four-year


cycle.
 Um,


>> all
 right.
 put
 in
 chat
 end
 of
 January


160
 Bitcoin.
 He
 said
 double
 from
 here,


right?
 The
 180.
 90
 time
 2
 is
 180.
 I


mean,
 what
 do
 we
 think?
 End
 of
 January


180.


Is
 that
 is
 that
 realistic
 to
 anybody?


>> And
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 big
 question.


If
 Bitcoin
 breaks
 125
 in
 January,
 there


is
 no
 4-year
 cycle.


>> What
 did
 happen
 on
 October
 10th?
 Like


>> 90%
 correct?
 because
 you
 know
 uh
 there's


going
 to
 be
 10%
 you
 don't
 know
 if
 there


was
 something
 else.


>> Just
 to
 clarify
 is
 the
 reason
 we
 don't


know
 what's
 happening
 because
 of
 the


anonymity
 of
 crypto.
 We
 don't
 know
 who


owns
 which
 wallets
 and
 so
 it's
 harder
 to


track
 what's
 actually
 happening.


>> Well,
 it's
 that
 and
 plus
 you
 know
 um
 you


know
 if
 when
 we
 look
 at
 liquidation


events
 like
 in
 for
 in
 in
 the
 stock


market
 90%
 of
 what
 someone
 will
 explain


is
 probably
 correct
 but
 10%
 like
 90%
 it


would
 be
 90%
 to
 correct
 say
 that
 the


February
 to
 April
 decline
 was
 largely


due
 to
 the
 Trump
 tariffs.


>> Yes.
 But
 the
 other
 10%
 would
 be
 like,


well,
 stocks
 were
 already
 expensive
 and


they
 were
 overdue
 for
 a
 correction.
 So


that's
 that's
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 9010.


>> So
 give
 us
 your
 90%.
 What
 do
 you
 think


happened?


>> On
 October
 10th,
 there
 was
 two
 things


that
 happened.
 One
 was
 a
 triggering


event,
 which
 was
 Trump
 announced
 uh,
 you


know,
 a
 reescalation
 of
 tariffs
 with


China,
 like
 a
 tripling
 of
 proposed


tariffs.
 And
 um,
 because
 markets
 were


closed,
 historically
 uh,
 crypto
 is
 what


reflects
 reaction
 to
 a
 macro
 event.
 uh


when
 you're
 already
 aftermarket
 hours


like
 if
 the
 S&P
 was
 open
 it
 probably


wouldn't
 have
 been
 got
 punched
 as
 hard


but
 crypto
 prices
 fell
 now
 crypto
 prices


falling
 system
 can
 handle
 that
 uh


because
 you
 know
 crypto
 is
 a


hypervolatile
 by
 nature
 so
 large
 swings


in
 prices
 shouldn't
 really
 overload
 the


system
 and
 even
 volume
 shouldn't


overload
 the
 system
 because
 crypto


trades
 uh
 you
 know
 there's
 so
 much


automated
 trading
 however
 there
 was
 an


algorithm
 in
 place
 that


actually
 what
 I
 call
 a
 glitch


on
 a
 on
 a
 specific
 exchange.
 Okay.
 Um


many
 people
 use
 leverage
 in
 crypto.
 I


mean
 it
 attracts
 leverage
 trading
 but


people
 put
 up
 collateral
 so
 they
 can
 do


leverage
 trading.
 One
 of
 the
 collaterals


is
 stable
 coins.
 Okay.
 And
 stable
 coins


are
 pretty
 safe
 collateral
 because
 hey


if
 it's
 Tether
 it
 trades
 at
 a
 dollar
 uh


it's
 pretty
 safe
 collateral.
 And
 so
 you


can
 borrow
 a
 lot
 against
 safe


collateral.
 And
 if
 it
 was
 USDC
 circle,


that's
 also
 a
 really
 stable
 coin
 because


it's
 uh
 a
 st
 it's
 backed
 by
 a
 dollar.


However,
 there
 was
 a
 popular
 stable
 coin


called
 USDA.
 Uh
 it
 was
 an
 algorithmic


stable
 coin.
 Okay.


>> Okay.
 And
 on
 one
 particular
 exchange


because
 of
 the
 shock
 of
 Friday,
 uh


internal
 prices
 like
 people
 bid
 ask
 of


that
 stable
 coin
 actually
 got
 out
 of


whack.
 Suddenly
 the
 price
 went
 to
 65


even
 though
 it's
 supposed
 to
 be


essentially
 worth
 a
 dollar.
 So,
 but


within
 one
 exchange
 that
 the
 the
 quoted


price
 dropped
 to
 65.
 Well,
 that
 meant


that
 all
 the
 collateral
 for
 every


account
 that
 used
 that
 particular
 stable


coin
 to
 borrow
 money
 was
 now
 in
 deficit.


Okay?
 Even
 if
 it
 was
 just
 one
 dollar


that
 traded
 at
 that
 price,
 it
 was


already
 putting
 every
 single
 piece
 of


collateral
 at
 risk
 at
 into
 deficit.
 So


then
 something
 called
 ADL
 was
 triggered,


automatic
 deleveraging.
 And
 so
 in
 in
 one


exchange,
 everybody
 who
 had
 who
 had
 used


that
 stable
 coin
 as
 collateral
 basically


got
 wiped
 their
 accounts
 liquidated.


Well,
 what
 were
 those
 accounts
 long?


They
 were
 long
 altcoins
 and
 all
 these


different
 cryptos
 that
 suddenly
 got


dumped
 on
 to
 spot
 exchanges.
 So
 then
 on


all
 these
 other
 exchanges,
 suddenly
 some


cryp
 some
 altcoins
 suddenly
 went
 down


99%.
 because
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 selling


from
 ADL,
 but
 it
 triggered
 a
 domino


effect
 of
 all
 these
 other
 exchanges


triggering
 other
 ADLs
 because
 spot


prices
 of
 all
 these
 alts
 dropped.
 So,


that
 to
 me
 was
 a
 glitch
 because
 it
 was


like
 an
 illquid
 quote
 that
 didn't


represent
 a
 true
 VWAP
 triggered
 an
 ADL


that
 triggered
 a
 cascade
 of
 ADLs.
 So


again,
 Tom
 Lee
 has
 explained
 this


argument
 multiple
 times,
 but
 he


continues
 to
 believe
 that
 it
 was
 a


glitch
 that
 caused
 the
 crypto


deleveraging.
 And
 maybe
 that
 glitch
 will


reverse,
 which
 is
 why
 he
 thinks
 it
 could


double
 by
 January.
 Or
 maybe
 that
 glitch


might
 be,
 you
 know,
 a
 function
 of
 the


crypto
 ecosystem.
 And
 that's
 why
 we've


kind
 of
 seen
 the
 decline
 of
 Bitcoin
 and


Ethereum.
 Uh
 folks,
 I
 didn't
 know
 if
 he


would
 make
 it,
 but
 he
 is
 backstage,


ladies
 and
 gentlemen,
 probably
 calling


in
 from
 the
 car.


We
 got
 the
 milkman.


Steve,
 how
 are
 you?


>> What's
 going
 on
 a
 minute?


>> Have
 you
 paid
 attention
 to
 the
 market
 at


all
 or
 have
 you
 been
 just
 eating


meatballs?


>> Today
 was
 a
 bad
 day
 for
 me.


>> Okay.
 I
 I
 think
 it
 has
 nothing
 I'm


assuming
 your
 day
 had
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


the
 market
 for
 why
 you're
 saying
 it's


bad.


>> No.
 Lawyers,
 meetings,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 you
 were
 busy
 the
 whole
 day.


>> Yes.
 I
 did
 make
 two
 buys
 and
 I
 did
 see


the
 market
 was
 down
 and
 if
 you
 would


like
 me
 to
 say
 the
 three
 words
 I
 am


happy
 to.


>> Um


well
 let
 me


let
 me
 pair
 it
 with
 a
 question.
 Do
 you


uh
 do
 you
 care
 about
 open
 AI
 and


delaying
 a
 data
 center
 with
 Oracle?


>> I
 don't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]


You
 mean
 we're
 going
 to
 delay
 one
 data


center
 out
 of
 all
 the
 data
 centers
 that


are
 going
 up?


>> Good.
 We
 don't
 have
 enough
 energy
 as
 it


is.


>> That's
 a
 good
 point.
 We
 don't
 have


enough
 energy.
 That's
 fair.


>> I
 mean,
 one
 data
 center.
 I
 mean,
 they're


freaking
 out
 about
 one
 data
 center.


Like,
 come
 on.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 look,
 the
 price


action
 today
 was
 really
 weird,
 but
 all


of
 it
 I
 outside
 of
 Broadcom
 going
 down,


I
 think
 was
 based
 on
 this
 OpenAI


headline.
 And
 I
 agree.
 It's
 just
 doesn't


seem
 like
 the
 biggest
 deal
 in
 the
 world.


>> It
 just
 goes
 back
 to
 does
 this
 matter


for
 the
 largest
 companies
 in
 the
 market.


Open
 AI


holding
 off
 on
 one
 data
 center
 is
 not


impacting
 what
 Oracle
 is
 spending.
 It
 is


not
 impacting
 what
 Microsoft
 is
 spending


or
 any
 of
 these
 other
 companies.
 This
 is


not
 a
 blemish
 on
 AI.
 AI
 is
 very
 real
 and


how
 many
 data
 centers
 that
 are
 going
 to


be
 built
 is
 a
 moving
 target
 and
 it's


going
 to
 continue
 to
 shift
 for
 years.


So,
 the
 Bears
 are
 trying
 to
 grab
 at
 any


little
 straw
 they
 can.


>> Okay.
 So,
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 some
 questions


about
 what
 we've
 been
 talking
 about
 for


the
 past
 hour.
 Um,
 we
 listened
 to
 this


new
 Tom
 Lee
 podcast
 with
 with
 Scott


Galloway
 and
 uh,
 it
 sounded
 pretty


bearish
 for
 next
 year.
 It's
 it's
 hard
 to


act
 like
 he
 didn't.
 And
 this
 is
 his


thesis
 and
 I
 just
 want
 to
 know
 if
 you


think
 this
 makes
 sense.
 He
 thinks
 we're


going
 to
 go
 down
 20%.
 So,
 let's
 say
 we


go
 from
 690
 to
 550
 and
 then
 we're
 going


to
 go
 up
 40%
 to
 end
 the
 year
 at
 770
 on


the
 S&P.
 He
 thinks
 that's
 how
 the
 year


plays
 out.


I
 know
 you're
 still
 thinking
 through
 how


you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 play
 out,
 but
 is


that
 reasonable
 to
 you?


>> I
 mean,
 sure,
 it's
 reasonable
 because
 a


drawback
 is
 inevitable.
 The
 problem
 is


to
 get
 a
 20%
 draw
 down,
 something


dramatic
 has
 to
 happen.
 I
 think
 a
 draw


down
 is
 going
 to
 be
 more
 in
 the
 range
 of


5
 to
 10%.
 Unless
 there's
 some
 unforeseen


event
 that
 happens
 to
 make
 it
 even
 more


drastic.


I
 mean,
 you
 look
 at
 the
 Fed
 data,
 you


look
 at
 all
 the
 earnings
 data,
 it


doesn't
 seem
 like
 there's
 an
 event


that's
 going
 to
 cause
 a
 20%
 draw
 down.


>> Yes.
 And
 I
 think
 what's
 more
 unrealistic


about
 this
 is
 that
 I
 mean,
 correct
 me
 if


I'm
 wrong,
 you've
 been
 around
 markets


longer
 than
 me,
 but
 last
 time
 we
 had
 a


30%
 draw
 down
 and
 then
 a
 essentially,


what
 is
 it?
 50%
 reversal
 was
 this
 year.


And
 it
 happened
 because
 of
 Liberation


Day
 and
 then
 Trump
 tweeting
 by
 the
 dip.


for
 that
 to
 happen
 again
 for
 that
 20%


and
 then
 V-shape
 40%
 most
 hated
 Vshaped


route
 like
 I
 don't
 know if
 that
 could


just
 happen
 again
 randomly
 as
 you
 said


>> it's
 gonna
 be
 difficult
 to
 h
 it's
 going


to
 be
 diff
 difficult
 to
 happen
 one
 of


the
 problems
 is


>> too
 many
 people
 have
 trigger
 fingers
 and


for
 some
 reason
 people
 just
 try
 front


running
 any
 little
 piece
 of
 news
 because


they
 think
 they
 can
 outsmart
 the
 markets


and
 in
 the
 long
 run
 nobody
 can
 outsmart


the
 markets
 I
 mean
 you


It's
 the
 hardest
 thing
 to
 do.
 That's
 why


most
 traders
 lose
 money.
 And
 sometimes


access
 to
 information
 and
 access
 just
 to


move
 money
 within
 a
 millisecond
 is
 not


necessarily
 a
 great
 thing
 because
 of


stuff
 like
 that.
 Now,
 can
 we
 go
 down


20%?
 Sure.
 But
 I
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 pretty
 hard
 to
 create
 a


scenario
 where
 that
 happens
 if
 we
 take


what
 the
 Fed
 said
 at
 face
 value.
 You


have
 unemployment
 that's
 going
 to


decline.
 You
 have
 GDP
 growth
 which
 is


going
 to
 expand.
 And
 if
 we
 look
 at


earnings
 data,
 not
 it's
 not
 just
 MAG
 7,


the
 broad
 market
 companies
 are
 expanding


earnings.
 I
 mean
 look,


>> so
 that
 but
 that's
 what
 made
 Tom's


comments
 to
 me
 very
 confusing
 because
 as


you
 said
 earnings
 are
 expanding
 and
 the


Fed
 is
 easing
 which
 means
 20%
 draw.


We're
 talking
 about
 5500
 on
 the
 for
 that


to
 happen.
 Uh
 it's
 hard
 in
 that
 macro


landscape.
 So,
 so
 then
 what's
 the


reason,
 right?
 And
 as
 you're
 listening


to
 the
 podcast,
 his
 argument
 is
 90%
 of


AI
 stocks
 are
 overvalued.


This
 is
 verbatim
 what
 he
 says.
 He
 said,


I'm
 being
 generous
 here,
 probably
 95%
 of


them.
 And
 then
 number
 two,
 he's
 like,
 we


need
 to
 consolidate
 a
 three-year
 bull


market
 of
 gains,
 which
 means
 we


inevitably
 have
 to
 have
 a
 20%
 hit.


And
 it's
 confusing
 because
 if
 the
 Fed
 is


easing
 and
 the
 AI
 trade
 is
 still
 intact,


which
 which
 is
 defined
 as
 earnings
 are


growing,
 what
 is
 the
 catalyst
 to
 just


randomly
 have
 a
 20%
 drop?


>> So,
 can
 I
 put
 on
 my
 tinfoil
 hat?


>> Go
 ahead.


>> Tinfoil
 hat.
 Steve
 is
 going
 to
 say


20%
 draw
 down
 is
 not
 happening
 next
 year


because
 what's
 the
 biggest
 event
 next


year
 that's
 going
 to
 take
 place?


>> Midterms.
 And
 do
 you
 really
 think
 Trump


is
 gonna
 risk?
 He
 did
 the
 liberation
 day


[ __ ]
 this
 year
 because
 there
 was
 no


midterms
 in
 sight
 and
 he
 knew
 that
 he


had
 time
 to
 fix
 it.
 Okay.
 Do
 you
 really


think
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 reckless


next
 year
 and
 risk
 losing
 both
 branches?


>> Unless
 Trump
 ends
 up
 just
 saying
 he


doesn't
 care
 anymore
 and
 he's
 like,
 you


know what,
 screw
 it.
 Like
 it
 is
 what
 it


is.
 But
 if
 he
 cares
 about


>> what
 he's
 going
 to
 do
 because
 at
 this


point
 it's
 more
 for
 legacy
 than
 anything


else.
 He
 can't
 run
 again.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 if
 he
 loses
 the
 House
 and


the
 Senate,
 he's
 a
 lame
 duck
 president.


He's
 gonna
 have
 two
 years
 of
 nothing.


Nothing
 will
 get
 passed.
 Absolutely


nothing.
 It's
 over.
 So,
 I
 mean,
 and
 so


then
 the
 question
 becomes,
 okay,
 like
 if


the
 stock
 market
 is
 sacrificed
 with
 some


20%
 draw
 down,
 uh,
 can
 they
 still
 win?


And
 I
 don't
 think
 so
 because
 the
 only


way
 you
 can
 imagine
 they
 could
 still
 win


is
 if
 affordability
 becomes
 phenomenal,


right?
 Like
 if
 like
 if
 like
 gas
 prices


just
 go
 like
 everything
 gets
 so
 much


better
 from
 the
 affordability


perspective.
 The
 problem
 is
 if
 asset


prices
 go
 down
 20%.
 Affordability
 is


going
 to
 get
 worse
 because
 the
 rich
 are


going
 to
 stop
 spending
 at
 that
 point.


They're
 going
 to
 feel
 less
 rich,
 right?


>> And
 you
 have
 more
 and
 more
 people


retiring.
 More
 and
 more
 people
 are
 tied


to
 401k
 plans
 rather
 than
 pensions.
 And


when
 you
 have
 people
 in
 an
 election
 year


seeing
 their
 nest
 egg
 declining


that
 that
 is
 the
 most
 powerful
 motivator


to
 get
 out
 and
 vote.


>> Yes.
 I
 mean
 if
 you're
 65
 and
 you
 see
 a


20%
 draw
 down
 in
 your
 nest
 egg
 next
 year


that's
 not
 fun.


>> No.
 And
 that
 could
 cause
 people
 to
 go


out
 and
 vote.
 I
 don't
 think
 they're


going
 to
 be
 reckless
 next
 year.
 And
 I


think
 the
 combination
 of
 a
 new
 Fed
 chair


easing
 policy,


if
 we
 don't
 get
 an
 invasion,
 if
 we


actually
 get
 a
 settlement
 to
 the
 Ukraine


war,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 seeing
 an
 event


that's
 going
 to
 take
 us
 down
 20%.
 Are


there
 going
 to
 be
 pockets
 of
 5%


declines?
 Yeah,
 it
 happens
 every
 year,


but
 20%
 decline,
 that's
 a
 huge
 decline.


>> That's
 massive.
 That's
 29.
 That
 was
 2022


was
 a
 19.7%
 decline.
 So
 he's
 expecting


us
 to
 go
 through
 that
 within
 12
 months


and
 then
 rebound
 40%.
 Like
 I
 am
 so


confused.
 And
 here's
 my
 question
 to
 you.


Why
 do
 you
 think
 that's
 his
 take?


>> Do
 you
 have
 any
 conspiracy
 theory
 on


where
 he's


>> No,
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 conspiracy
 theory


on
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 real
 conspiracy


theory
 is
 more
 a
 tinfoil
 hat
 has
 to


project
 what
 is
 best
 for
 the


administration
 because
 they
 seem
 to
 try


to
 do
 things


in
 the
 space
 of
 what
 is
 going
 to
 work


for
 them
 and
 having
 a
 market
 going
 down


heading
 into
 midterms
 is
 a
 death


sentence.
 So
 they're
 going
 to
 do


everything
 politically
 to
 keep
 things
 at


bay.


Some
 theories
 I'm
 seeing
 in
 the
 chat,


which
 honestly
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 these
 are


crazy
 theories,
 is
 Tom
 is
 compensating


for
 his
 end
 ofear
 crypto
 predictions


being
 so
 wrong
 that
 now
 he's


>> It's
 a
 It's
 a
 great
 It
 is
 a
 great


conspiracy
 theory
 because
 you
 know what?


His
 12,000
 Ethereum
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 is


not
 looking
 pretty
 [ __ ]
 good
 right


now.


>> Neither
 is
 250,000
 Bitcoin.
 I
 mean,


like,


>> and
 look,
 I
 love
 Tom,
 but
 this
 is
 where,


as
 a
 as
 a
 content
 creator,
 I
 I
 consider


myself
 to
 be
 pretty
 damn
 objective.
 I


know
 people
 think
 I'm
 super
 uber
 bullish


Palunteer.
 They
 weren't
 there
 for
 two


years
 when
 you
 and
 me
 were
 on
 Paler


Weekly
 every
 week
 criticizing
 the


company
 because
 we
 weren't
 seeing
 what


we
 needed
 to
 see.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 call


things
 like
 I
 see
 them.
 And
 saying


200,000
 Bitcoin,


it's
 setting
 yourself
 up
 for
 and
 he
 he


just
 on
 the
 podcast
 he
 said
 Bitcoin


should
 still
 be
 double
 by
 end
 of


January.
 That
 would
 be
 one
 is
 insane.


It's
 it's
 also
 irresponsible
 and
 that's


the
 other
 issue
 because
 you
 start
 to
 get


into
 the
 conversation
 of
 Kathy
 which
 I


mean
 look
 her
 brand
 isn't
 really
 a
 brand


anymore
 because
 in
 2021
 she
 was


promising
 40%
 keer
 on
 Roku
 for
 the
 next


five
 like
 like
 when
 you
 say
 that
 [ __ ]


it
 doesn't
 work
 out
 egregiously
 people


stop
 listening


so


I
 don't
 know
 maybe
 that's
 the
 argument


maybe
 he's
 becoming
 more
 bearish
 to
 make


up
 for
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 is
 ultra
 bullish


>> maybe.


>> I'm
 curious
 to
 hear
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other


analysts
 and
 see
 what
 they
 have
 to
 say


as
 well
 outside
 of
 this.
 Tom,


I
 do
 want
 to
 hear
 those
 that
 are
 bullish


or
 bearish
 or
 have
 a,
 you
 know,


potential
 bullish
 bearish
 perspective


together
 around
 it'll
 be
 bad,
 but
 it'll


be
 good
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 Like,
 I
 don't


know.


That's
 how
 I
 would
 want
 to
 be
 hearing


what
 goes
 on
 in


>> command.


What'
 you
 say?


>> Has
 Dan
 Ives
 come
 out
 and
 said
 anything?


>> Well,
 he's
 been
 calling
 for
 20%
 NASA.


But
 see,
 even
 Dan,
 Dude,
 I'm
 happy
 you


brought
 this
 up
 because
 I
 haven't
 uh


talked
 about
 this.
 Even
 Dan
 Ives
 recent


interviews,
 he's
 like,
 "We
 have
 two


years
 left
 of
 this
 bull
 market."


And
 and
 I'm
 just
 like,
 well,


>> well,


>> I
 was
 I
 was
 hearing,
 you
 know,
 next
 five


to
 10
 years.
 Now
 he's
 just
 like


explicitly
 we
 have
 two
 years
 left.
 I'm


like,
 okay.
 So


even
 he
 is
 consolidating
 the
 view
 to


like
 and
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't


blame
 them.
 I
 just
 think
 they're


realizing,
 dude,
 these
 valuations
 are


getting
 up
 there.
 Yes,
 you
 have
 stocks


that
 are
 cheap
 like
 Meta
 and
 Nvidia,
 but


you
 also
 have
 other
 names
 that
 are


expensive.
 And
 it's
 hard
 for
 them
 to
 say


it's
 10
 p.m.
 at
 the
 party,
 even
 though


they
 say
 that
 when
 it
 might
 not
 be
 10


p.m.
 at
 the
 party.


Yeah,
 but
 look,
 it
 can
 be
 10
 10
 p.m.
 at


the
 party
 or
 even
 700
 p.m.
 at
 the
 party


and
 valuations
 can
 be
 out
 of
 whack
 on


some
 companies.
 Being
 700
 p.m.
 or
 10


p.m.
 on
 the
 party


>> means
 that
 these
 companies
 have
 a
 lot
 of


runway
 for
 growth.
 That
 has
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 valuations.
 And
 look,
 there
 are


companies
 that
 are
 overvalued.
 If
 you


think
 about
 what
 a
 stock
 actually


represents,
 it
 represents
 all
 the


revenue
 and
 all
 the
 earnings
 and
 all
 the


free
 cash
 flow
 that
 a
 company's
 going
 to


produce.
 And
 when
 you're
 buying
 one


stock
 over
 another,
 you're
 buying
 their


profitability
 and
 their
 future
 growth.


And


there
 are
 some
 things
 that
 are


overvalued,
 but
 that's
 every
 market.
 Now


in
 our
 what
 is
 in
 our
 favor
 is
 the


companies
 that
 are
 overvalued
 are
 not
 an


overwhelming
 percentage
 of
 the
 S&P


whereas
 the
 largest
 companies
 of
 the
 S&P


look
 like
 they're
 undervalued.
 So
 even


if
 some
 of
 these
 companies
 take
 a


haircut,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 that


detrimental
 unless
 people
 get
 scared
 and


just
 start
 selling
 across
 the
 board.
 But


in
 all
 seriousness,
 if
 Palanteer
 was
 to


retrace
 to
 125,
 that
 shouldn't
 have
 a


significant
 relevance
 on
 the
 S&P
 unless


people
 get
 shook
 and
 start
 selling
 off


Nvidia,
 Alphabet,
 and
 Amazon.


>> But
 the
 the
 nuance
 here
 is
 that
 Palenter


tends
 to
 trade
 with
 Nvidia.
 So,
 I
 agree


with
 you.
 Pounder
 to
 125,
 the
 multiple


would
 still
 be
 very
 aggressive.
 But
 if


that
 were
 to
 happen,
 is
 it
 almost


inevitable
 that
 Nvidia,
 AMD,
 all
 those


like
 they
 have
 to
 fall
 with
 it?
 Like
 is


it
 even
 possible
 for
 it
 to
 independently


fall
 given
 how
 tied
 up
 it
 is
 in
 that


bucket?
 I
 don't
 know.


>> It's
 possible,
 but
 the
 problem
 is
 you're


going
 to
 have
 too
 many
 people
 trying
 to


jump
 on
 the
 bandwagon.
 And
 this
 is
 what


I
 don't
 understand.
 Why
 does
 everybody


want
 to
 bet
 against
 success
 and
 bet


against
 progress
 and
 bet
 against


American


in
 um
 inuity?
 It
 just
 it
 doesn't
 make


sense
 why
 people
 want
 to
 cheer
 for
 this


stuff
 not
 to
 work.
 That
 never
 made
 sense


to
 me.


Yeah,
 look,
 I
 agree.
 And
 again,
 to
 your


point
 about
 what
 do
 you
 bet
 on?
 Like


Trump
 just
 said
 he
 wants
 rates
 at
 1%.


Maybe
 we
 don't
 get
 rates
 at
 1%,
 but


they're
 calling
 they're
 going
 down.
 Like


where
 are
 you
 going
 to
 put
 your
 money?


>> Rates
 are
 going
 to
 be
 two
 two
 and
 a


half%.
 They're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 one.


They'll
 be
 two
 two
 and
 a
 half.
 And


that's
 a
 great
 thing.
 Where
 do
 you
 put


your
 money?
 You're
 you're
 not
 generating


income
 on
 the
 sidelines
 in
 a
 bond
 with
 a


two
 and
 a
 half%
 coupon.
 What
 are
 you


going
 to
 do?
 You
 got
 go
 buy
 a
 $1,000


bond
 and
 generate
 $25.


>> Yeah,
 it
 it's
 it's
 again
 if
 you
 have
 a


lot
 of
 money,
 maybe
 that
 sounds
 like
 a


great
 idea
 for
 no
 risk,
 but


>> different
 story.
 If
 you
 have
 $100


million,


>> you
 know,


>> but
 for
 people
 that
 are
 investing
 and


saving
 for
 their
 retirement,
 saving
 for


a
 house,
 or
 just
 investing
 for
 their


future,
 you're
 not
 buying
 bonds.
 There's


nowhere
 else
 to
 put
 money
 but
 the
 stock


market
 or
 real
 estate.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


many
 people
 actually
 play
 in
 the
 real


estate
 game.


>> Yes.
 I
 don't
 think
 many
 people
 play
 the


real
 estate
 game.
 I
 don't
 think
 many


people
 are
 experts
 on
 gold
 and
 silver


and
 copper.
 So
 like
 the
 next
 best
 thing


is
 the
 company
 you
 use
 every
 day,
 Amazon


or
 the
 company
 that
 you
 know
 is
 in
 the


headlines
 every
 day
 because
 they're
 at


the
 center
 of
 AI
 which
 is
 Nvidia.
 So,


and
 those
 companies
 aren't
 trading
 at


crazy
 levels,
 which
 is
 again
 why
 I'm


perplexed
 by
 this.
 We
 have
 to
 have
 a
 20%


draw
 down.
 Definitely
 we
 should
 have


some
 draw
 downs.
 Not
 saying
 we
 shouldn't


20%.
 We're
 talking
 about
 erasing
 the


entirety
 of
 the
 year
 unless
 he's
 saying


we're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 7,300
 then
 we
 get
 a


20%
 draw
 down
 which
 like
 again
 it
 just


complicates
 how
 that
 plays
 out.
 Um
 but


but
 but
 if
 we
 take
 away
 this
 entire


year,
 the
 earnings
 multiples
 are
 going


to
 get
 even
 like
 I
 mean
 20%
 down
 on


Meta,
 we're
 talking
 about
 what
 like
 a
 12


PE
 at
 that
 point.


>> But
 and
 here's
 where
 we're
 what
 we're


not
 discussing
 between
 now
 and
 the
 end


of
 next
 year.
 You
 have
 four
 earnings


calls.
 You
 have
 four
 earning
 cycles.


You're
 telling
 me
 that
 the
 sentiment
 is


going
 to
 be
 devastating
 over
 the
 next


four
 earnings
 calls
 and
 press
 releases


and
 prints.
 I'm
 not
 buying
 that
 story.


>> Yeah,


I
 agree.
 Look,
 the
 the
 the
 simple
 way
 to


protect
 against
 all
 of
 this
 if
 people
 do


buy
 into
 the
 thesis
 that
 we're
 going to


have
 some
 massive
 20%
 draw
 down
 or


something,
 it's
 it's
 two
 very
 simple


things
 to
 do.
 Like,
 it's
 really
 not
 that


complicated.
 And
 it's
 about
 how
 people,


you
 know,
 sleep
 well
 at
 night.
 Take
 some


profits.


Number
 one,
 very
 simple
 to
 do.
 Number


two,
 you
 buy
 some
 puts.


Like
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 super
 cl.
 You


don't
 have
 to
 be
 net
 bearish
 on
 the


markets
 to
 take
 some
 profits
 or
 to
 buy


some
 protection.
 But
 the
 broader


question
 is
 for
 straight
 up
 bears
 that


are
 like,
 "Nope,
 short
 it.
 It's
 all


going
 down."
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we
 can


easily
 justify
 that
 when
 the
 AI
 trade


and
 the
 earnings
 are
 very
 real
 and
 the


Fed
 is
 easing.


>> But
 let
 me
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 something.


Hedge
 funds
 are
 professional
 money


managers,
 correct?


>> Yeah.


>> They
 didn't
 even
 get
 it
 right
 on


liberation
 day.
 They
 were
 shook
 selling


everything.
 They
 didn't
 get
 back
 in
 at


the
 right
 time.
 So
 what
 are
 the
 chances


that
 individual
 investors
 are
 going
 to


say,
 you
 know
 what,
 they're
 calling
 for


a
 20%
 draw
 down.
 I'm
 going
 to
 front
 run


and
 sell
 now
 and
 I'll
 get
 back
 in
 when


the
 coast
 is
 clear.


>> Oh,
 the
 the
 chances
 are
 zero.
 But
 my


point
 is
 if
 you
 need
 to
 if
 you
 if
 you


need
 money
 to
 pay
 for
 your
 kid
 who's


going
 to
 college
 next
 year
 and
 you


>> different
 that's
 a
 different
 story.


>> That's
 my
 point.
 If
 you
 simply
 can't


sleep
 at
 night
 because
 you
 think
 things


are
 iffy,
 then
 that's
 how
 you
 hedge.
 You


take
 some
 profits.
 Right.


>> Right.
 But
 professional
 man
 money


managers
 can't
 even
 get
 in
 and
 get
 out


at
 the
 opportune
 times.
 What
 makes


anybody
 think
 that
 they're
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 do
 it?
 Also,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 not


easy.


>> Someone
 said
 that
 kid
 better
 get
 a
 job.


>> Like,


it
 just
 doesn't
 the
 whole
 thing
 doesn't


make
 sense
 to
 me.
 And
 market
 some
 parts


of
 the
 market
 can
 get
 expensive.
 But


maybe
 this
 is
 what
 we
 need.
 Maybe
 we


need
 a
 reset
 on
 people
 chasing
 and


companies
 going
 to
 the
 moon.
 and
 look
 at


companies
 such
 as
 an
 Exxon
 Mobile
 or


Chevron
 being
 like,
 "Huh,
 we
 need


energy.
 Energy
 is
 not
 going
 away.
 Paying


under
 10
 times
 EBID
 off
 of
 this
 company


seems
 pretty
 freaking
 cheap."
 And


>> that's
 another
 thing
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say.


Other
 way
 to
 manage
 it
 is
 delever
 out
 of


super
 high
 beta
 names
 and
 get
 into
 stuff


that's
 in
 the
 right
 thematic
 like
 energy


that's
 also
 relatively
 inexpensive
 like


Exxon
 as
 you're
 saying
 that's
 another


way.


>> Yes.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 about
 super


beta
 names
 is
 they're
 super
 beta.
 They


don't
 have
 profitability
 and
 if
 they
 do


it's
 not
 much.
 And
 then
 you
 have


companies
 that
 are
 pumping
 out


tremendous
 profitability
 that
 are


trading
 at
 discounts.
 So
 maybe
 we're


going
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 reset,


but
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 the
 market
 has
 to


fall
 to
 happen.
 That
 could
 just
 be
 a


rotation.


>> Correct.
 Which
 by
 the
 way,
 S&P
 is
 not


that
 far
 from
 all-time
 highs
 even
 though


Nvidia,
 Broadcom,
 etc.
 are
 down.
 So
 we


have
 seen
 a
 rotation
 happen
 in
 front
 of


us.
 It's
 just
 a
 rotation
 out
 of
 tech


which
 is
 you
 know
 annoying
 for
 a
 lot
 of


tech
 investors
 but
 nonetheless
 we
 are


already
 starting
 to
 see
 that.


So
 that
 is
 a
 very
 fair
 point.


All
 right.
 Um,


>> I
 mean,
 are
 you
 worried?


>> No,
 I
 I
 just
 this
 podcast
 completely


like
 I
 got
 off
 the
 market
 open
 and
 I


just
 I
 turned
 it
 on.
 I'm
 getting
 some


work
 done
 and
 I'm
 listening
 to
 it
 and


I'm
 not
 even
 looking
 at
 the
 screen
 and
 I


look
 at
 the
 screen
 and
 I'm
 like,
 bro,


did
 I
 just
 see
 like
 when
 you
 listen
 to


it
 this
 weekend,
 you're
 going
 to
 feel


because
 the
 entire
 chat
 felt
 the
 same


when
 I
 played
 it
 for
 them.
 It
 is
 not
 the


same
 Tom
 Lee.
 Let's
 just
 say
 that.
 Maybe


he's
 catching
 like
 live
 [ __ ]
 just
 like


you
 said
 about
 crypto.


>> I
 think
 that
 makes
 sense.


>> I
 think
 he
 dude
 he's
 under
 a
 lot
 of


pressure.
 Got
 the
 crypto
 call
 wrong
 this


year
 and
 I
 I
 think
 now
 he's
 getting
 I


mean
 dude
 like
 remember
 we
 you
 and
 I


were
 we
 listen
 we
 we
 were
 on
 the
 phone


two
 weeks
 ago
 when
 we
 listened
 to
 Oswth


and
 you
 know
 he
 said
 sell
 everything


maybe
 buy
 Pokemon
 cards
 because
 apples


every
 everything's
 horrible.
 You
 need
 to


like
 just
 get
 out
 of
 the
 market.


So
 Scott
 Galloway
 gave
 Tom
 the
 same


questions
 essentially
 this
 the
 same


leadins
 of
 like
 hey
 we
 asked
 him
 this


what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 and
 then


Tom's
 like
 well
 I
 pretty
 much
 agree
 and


then
 he
 gives
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 it
 push


back
 but
 like
 the
 slightest
 of
 push
 back


to
 hedge
 his
 agreement
 to
 stay
 bullish


but
 as
 you're
 listening
 to
 it
 you're


like
 dude
 you're
 not
 bullish
 like
 just


you
 can
 come
 out
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be


bearish
 but
 be
 bearish
 but
 like
 you
 can


tell
 the
 guy's
 not
 necessarily
 excited


and
 so
 That's
 what
 really
 at least
 got


me
 thinking
 today
 of
 like
 what's
 going


on
 here.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 I
 I
 I
 appreciate


your
 perspective
 here
 as
 well
 because
 to


have
 a
 20%
 draw
 down
 and
 then
 40%
 upside


that
 that
 requires
 some
 type
 of
 event


geopolitics
 liberation
 day
 something


crazy.


>> And
 can
 we
 add
 one
 aspect
 to
 this?


Most
 people
 have
 their
 net
 worth
 locked


up
 in
 mutual
 funds
 and
 ETFs
 in
 their


401ks
 or
 retirement
 plans.
 Okay?
 You


also
 have
 an
 environment
 where
 pensions


are
 not
 really
 a
 thing
 anymore
 and


people
 are
 putting
 in
 every
 two
 weeks


into
 their
 retirement
 accounts.
 So,
 if


you're
 in
 a
 scenario
 where
 people
 are


not
 selling
 off
 their
 retirement


accounts
 and
 they're
 still
 putting


putting
 in,
 then


h
 how
 are
 we
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 we're


going
 to
 get
 a
 huge
 draw
 down
 if
 those


assets
 aren't
 getting
 sold?
 Because
 if


you
 take
 a
 poll,
 I
 mean,
 take
 a
 poll
 in


your
 chat.
 You
 probably
 have
 thousands


of
 people
 right
 now.
 Take
 a
 poll
 and
 put


this
 in
 it.
 During
 Liberation
 Day,
 did


you
 sell
 your
 retirement
 assets
 and
 then


buy
 back
 in
 over
 the
 summer?
 There's


probably
 going
 to
 be
 10%
 yes,
 if
 that.


>> Did
 you
 sell
 your
 retirement
 assets
 and


then
 buy
 back
 in?


>> Yeah,
 I
 really
 doubt
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 do


that.
 I
 mean,
 I
 definitely
 didn't
 do


that.
 I


>> I
 don't
 know
 anybody
 that
 did.


>> No.
 And
 to
 your
 point,
 like
 like
 like


these
 retirement
 funds,
 passive
 flows,


they're
 going to
 be
 coming
 in
 regardless


of
 the
 market's
 up
 or
 down.
 So
 to
 have


>> two
 weeks


>> every
 two
 weeks.
 And
 then
 so
 to
 have


that
 20%
 waterfall
 decline,
 uh
 it's
 not


going
 to
 be
 because
 people
 stop
 buying


every
 two
 weeks.
 It's
 going
 to
 have
 to


be
 because
 of
 something.
 And
 then
 it'll


beg
 the
 question,
 what
 is
 that


something?
 Because
 Tom
 Lee's
 argument


right
 now
 is
 just
 consolidation.
 I'm


like,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 enough
 of


an
 argument
 for
 a
 20%
 hit.
 consolidation


like
 consolidation
 that's
 10%
 to
 me


>> there
 is
 another
 question
 about
 how
 much


leverage
 should
 be
 allowed
 and


there
 are
 ETFs
 that
 have
 three
 four
 5x


leverage
 there
 are
 people
 that
 get
 a
 lot


of
 leverage
 in
 their
 trading
 accounts


and
 they
 probably
 shouldn't
 have
 access


to
 that
 type
 of
 leverage
 so
 that's
 also


something
 that
 is
 even
 more
 exploited


now
 than
 ever
 before
 so
 that's
 another


aspect
 that
 we
 have
 to
 take
 into


consideration
 and
 Well,
 one
 or
 two


people
 or
 one
 or
 two
 funds
 blowing
 up


because
 a
 leverage
 isn't
 going
 to
 tank
 a


market.
 But
 if
 you
 get
 a
 scenario
 where


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 going
 wrong
 at


the
 same
 time,
 it
 could
 make
 it
 where


you
 have
 an
 event
 where
 leverage
 gets


blown
 up.


>> Well,
 I'm
 hoping
 that
 after
 the
 freaking


dude
 5%
 down
 in
 November
 caused
 just


massive
 levels
 of
 margin
 calls
 and
 this


that
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 I
 am
 hoping


I'm
 just
 hoping
 that
 if
 we
 were
 to
 get


20%
 down
 as
 Tom
 Lee
 is
 saying
 that
 would


just
 wipe
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 I
 mean,


and
 think
 think
 about
 So,
 what's
 what's


the
 uh
 poll
 in
 your
 chat
 right
 now?


>> 89
 11.


>> Okay.
 So,
 like
 I
 said,
 around
 10%.


>> Probably
 sold.
 That's
 it.
 That's
 not
 a


lot.
 Stop
 the
 poll
 and
 add
 a
 new
 one.


Ask
 how
 many
 people
 are
 on
 have
 a
 margin


account.
 I
 bet
 you
 it's
 like
 75%.


>> Okay.
 The
 question
 rather
 should
 be,
 do


you
 use
 margin?


>> Do
 you
 use
 margin?


Because
 what
 I'm
 saying
 is
 I
 Yeah,
 I


just
 put
 the
 question.
 I'm
 hoping
 that


that
 event
 allowed
 people
 to
 realize


that
 they
 just
 can't
 be
 that


overlevered.
 If
 we
 were
 to
 get
 a
 because


if
 you
 get
 a
 20%
 draw
 down
 on
 margin
 and


you're
 getting
 liquidated
 on
 a
 5%
 margin


draw
 down
 on
 margin,
 your
 account's


blown
 up.
 It's
 just
 done.
 You're
 out.


>> Yes.


>> So,
 and
 again,
 there
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 anything
 intrinsically
 wrong


with
 using
 margin.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


strategic
 ways
 to
 do
 it,
 but
 being


levered
 heavily
 in
 a
 market
 that
 really


can't
 have
 anything
 go
 wrong.
 We're


trying
 to
 get
 26
 times
 earnings
 on
 the


S&P,
 you
 can't
 have
 a
 5
 10%
 move
 if


you're
 that
 overleveraged
 because
 then


it
 gets
 you
 wiped
 out.
 Right


now,
 in
 April,
 if
 it's
 the
 bottom
 and


you
 borrow
 some
 money
 to
 buy
 something


at
 5%
 that's
 going
 to
 go
 up
 80%,
 like


that's
 a
 really
 smart
 thing
 to
 do.
 But


buying
 stuff
 on
 margin
 when
 the
 market's


up
 20%
 for
 the
 year,
 that
 might
 not
 work


out
 if
 we
 have a
 crash.


>> Do
 you
 want
 to
 know
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 do


if
 we
 freaking
 go
 down
 20%.


>> I'm
 scared
 to
 ask,
 but
 what
 are
 you


going
 to
 do?


>> No.
 No.
 Take
 one
 guess
 of
 what
 I'm
 going


to
 buy
 if
 we
 go
 down
 20%.


>> Another
 set
 of
 meatballs
 at
 Paty's.


>> Well,
 they
 were
 delicious,
 but
 no.


>> You
 know,
 my
 sister
 tried
 those
 and
 she


loved
 it.
 She


>> Yeah,
 because
 they're
 made
 the
 real
 way.


A
 third
 beef,
 a
 third
 pork,
 and
 a
 third


would
 deal.


>> Uh,
 chat
 says
 milk
 and
 cookies.


>> I'm
 gonna
 buy
 TQQQ
 if
 we
 go
 down
 20%.


>> I've
 never
 heard
 you
 say
 that.


>> Because
 if
 we
 go
 down
 20%,
 what
 the
 hell


are
 the
 chances
 we're
 going
 down
 another


10?


>> But
 but
 see,
 that
 you
 got
 to
 have
 cash


during
 that.
 That's
 the
 problem
 because


when
 everyone
 gets
 wiped
 out
 on
 a
 20%


hit,
 no
 one
 has
 the
 money
 to
 buy
 it.
 But


you're
 right.


>> Right.
 But
 but but
 I
 mean
 I
 may
 be


sitting
 on
 some
 cash.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 I
 would
 believe
 you
 are.


>> I'll
 be
 buying
 some
 TT
 TQQQ
 if
 that


happens
 because
 you
 know
 what?
 I
 did
 not


do
 that
 in
 April
 and
 I
 should
 have.
 And


every
 downturn,
 and
 this
 is
 what
 people


need
 to
 realize.
 Take
 a
 step
 back,
 take


a
 breath,
 look
 at
 a
 long-term
 chart.
 No


matter
 how
 scary
 it
 is
 in
 the
 short


term,
 every
 gap
 gets
 filled.
 Every


downturn
 gets
 bought.
 It
 may
 not
 get


bought
 till
 5,
 10,
 15,
 20%.
 But


eventually,


there
 has
 never
 been
 a
 single
 downturn


in
 the
 history
 of
 the
 market
 from
 the


crash
 of
 29,
 the
 Black
 Monday
 to
 the
 dot


bubble
 to
 COVID
 that
 did
 not
 rebound.


So
 why
 are
 we
 scared
 of
 a
 crash?


>> No,
 I
 agree.
 I
 I
 agree
 so
 much.
 Like


worst
 case
 scenario,
 let's
 assume
 there


is
 some
 20%
 drop
 that
 you
 just
 got
 to


have
 some
 C.
 You
 got
 to
 not
 be


overlevered
 and
 have
 some
 freaking
 cash


because
 if
 if
 we
 in
 this
 market
 with


these
 multiples
 with
 this
 earnings


growth
 see
 a
 20%


uh
 decline
 again
 barring
 some
 like
 China


invasion
 or
 or
 crazy
 liberation
 day
 2.0


that
 is
 a
 back
 the
 truck
 up
 and
 buy.


But
 you
 got
 to
 have
 the
 cash
 in
 that


moment
 to
 make
 that
 happen.


>> How
 about
 this?
 Maybe
 we
 shouldn't
 be


buying
 shortdated
 oneweek
 options.
 Maybe


we
 shouldn't
 be
 buying
 freaking


uh
 spreads
 that
 expire
 in
 a
 week.
 Maybe


we
 shouldn't
 be
 gambling.
 We
 should
 be


looking
 longterm.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 has
 to


go
 right
 with
 shortdated
 investments.


And
 then
 that's
 how
 people
 lose
 money


because
 a
 little
 bit
 here
 and
 a
 little


bit
 there
 when
 you
 could
 just
 put
 that


into
 the
 spy.


It's
 very
 hard
 to
 outperform
 when
 you
 do


stuff
 like
 that
 because
 so
 many
 things


have
 to
 go
 right.
 But
 if
 you
 buy
 the
 spy


for
 a
 fiveyear
 period,
 over
 a
 fiveyear


period,
 you
 can
 almost
 guarantee
 in
 any


period
 in
 history
 it's
 gone
 right.


>> I
 100%
 agree.


>> 100%
 agree.


>> So
 I
 need
 to
 get


>> Go
 ahead.
 Go
 ahead.


>> Go
 ahead.
 You
 got
 it.
 No,
 I
 was
 just


going
 to
 say
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to
 get
 this


whole
 short-term
 trader
 mentality
 out
 of


everybody's
 head
 and
 make
 it
 normal
 that


you
 can
 see
 a
 draw
 down
 for
 five
 or
 10%.


But
 it's
 nothing
 to
 get
 worried
 about
 if


you
 don't
 need
 the
 money
 tomorrow.
 Just


because
 it
 says
 a
 different
 look,
 if
 you


put
 100
 grand
 in
 and
 it
 goes
 down
 to
 70


grand
 in
 three
 months,
 there
 is
 a


halfway
 decent
 chance
 that
 6
 to
 12


months
 from
 now
 you're
 sitting
 at
 110


112
 grand.
 Now,
 is
 that
 swing
 fun?


Absolutely
 not.
 But
 if
 you
 didn't
 need


the
 money
 and
 you
 weren't
 going
 to
 sell


anyway,
 so
 what?
 Just
 don't
 look
 your


account
 every
 day.


>> And
 and
 that
 goes
 back
 to
 my
 other
 point


like
 if
 you
 if
 you
 are
 not
 ready
 for
 a


20%
 draw
 down
 to
 have
 the
 mentality
 of
 I


just
 don't
 need
 to
 look
 at
 my
 account,


I'll
 be
 okay.
 Um
 then
 that
 means
 you're


overlevered,
 which
 goes
 back
 to
 my
 point


as
 well.
 Just
 like
 take
 some
 profits.
 If


you're
 overlevered,
 delever.
 Delever


when
 things
 are
 good,
 not
 when
 you're


forced
 to
 delever,
 right?
 because
 then


you're
 selling
 into
 weakness.
 Um,
 and


have
 that
 cash
 on
 the
 sidelines
 ready
 to


go.
 It's
 it's
 not
 the
 worst
 thing.
 Like


again,
 when
 things
 are
 recovering
 from


their
 worst,
 which
 is
 what
 we
 saw
 from


April
 basically
 to
 August,
 that's
 when


it
 was
 every
 single
 week
 like,
 you
 know,


Nvidia's
 at
 103,
 107.
 All
 right,
 Nvidia


got
 to
 120.
 Well,
 Nvidia
 probably
 should


be
 closer
 to
 150.
 And
 then
 we're
 buying


by
 now.
 It's
 like,
 all
 right,
 you
 can


nibble,
 but
 it
 can't
 be
 those
 massive,


massive
 big
 buys
 because
 Nvidia's
 up


100%
 from
 the
 lows.
 Robin's
 up
 300%
 from


the
 lows.


So,
 you
 probably
 can't
 take
 that
 big
 of


a
 swing,
 but
 that
 also
 means
 you
 can't


get
 that
 overlevered
 into
 taking
 that


big
 of
 a
 swing.


>> Do
 you
 mind
 if
 I
 say
 something


unconventional
 that
 goes
 against
 what


every
 single
 person
 who
 is
 smart
 says?


>> Okay.


How
 many
 people
 do
 you
 say
 do
 you
 hear


say
 cash
 is
 trash
 and
 I'm
 losing
 money


singing
 cash?
 How
 many
 people
 do
 you


hear
 say
 that
 on
 TV
 or
 that
 you
 talk
 to?


>> Decent
 decent
 number
 of
 people.


>> Good
 amount,
 right?
 You
 don't
 hear


people
 say
 cash
 is
 my
 friend,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 How
 about
 this?
 Maybe
 cash
 is
 your


friend.
 Because
 while
 you
 can
 sit
 there


and
 make
 an
 argument
 about
 earnings


power
 and
 buying
 power
 and
 what
 you
 can


buy
 today
 versus
 what
 you
 can
 buy
 in
 the


future,
 I'm
 not
 talking
 about
 saying
 on


cash
 to
 go
 buy
 freaking
 goods.
 I'm


talking
 about
 sitting
 on
 cash
 in
 your


account.
 And
 if
 the
 market
 goes
 down
 and


a
 stock
 that
 you
 want
 is
 at
 a
 cheaper


price,
 even
 if
 you've
 got
 inflation
 and


your
 cash
 can't
 buy
 as
 much
 of
 the


supermarket
 as
 it
 could
 six
 months
 ago


or
 a
 year
 from
 now,
 you're
 actually
 able


to
 buy
 more
 shares
 of
 the
 same
 company.


So,
 is
 your
 cash
 really
 trash
 from
 an


investing
 standpoint?
 Absolutely
 not.


It's
 a
 tool
 to
 be
 utilized.
 Well,
 and


that's
 another
 point
 to
 the
 idea
 of
 it's


okay
 to
 take
 some
 profits
 because
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 if
 you're
 up
 massively


on
 a
 position
 and
 you
 want
 to
 have
 some


of
 that
 cash,
 if
 you
 don't
 want
 to


borrow
 money
 when
 things
 go
 bad
 to
 buy


the
 dip,
 which
 not
 everyone
 has
 access


to,
 then
 you
 just
 need
 cash.
 And
 the
 way


to
 get
 cash
 is
 potentially
 to
 sell
 out


of
 things
 that
 you're
 up
 a
 lot
 on
 or


that
 you're
 okay
 with
 trimming
 10%
 of
 a


position
 and
 just
 holding
 on
 the


sidelines.
 So,
 I
 agree.
 It
 becomes
 a


position
 that
 becomes
 useful


>> and


>> whenever
 we
 do
 have


>> it
 sits
 it
 sits
 in
 a
 money
 market.
 It


collects
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 interest
 and


it's
 there
 in
 the
 event
 that
 something


goes
 down.
 Look,
 not
 everybody
 can
 time


everything
 correctly.
 And
 I
 know


everybody's
 a
 genius.
 They
 get
 in
 at
 the


ground
 floor
 and
 everything.
 I
 know.
 I


know.
 I
 know.
 The
 reality
 is
 I'm
 a


halfway
 intelligent
 person
 and
 I
 started


a
 position
 in
 QXO
 and
 it
 went
 down
 on


me.
 It
 started
 1840.
 It
 went
 down
 to
 16


or
 so
 and
 I
 bought
 more
 in
 the
 high
 16s.


That
 cash
 that
 I
 used
 wasn't
 trash.
 That


allowed
 me
 to
 get
 more
 shares
 than
 if
 I


had
 spent
 that
 the
 first
 time
 I
 bought


and
 now
 it's
 over
 20.
 So,
 was
 that
 cash


trash
 that
 I
 was
 sitting
 on?


>> No.


So,
 I
 guess
 I
 guess
 you
 you
 would


summarize
 2026
 so
 far
 as
 we're
 a
 couple


weeks
 away
 from
 it
 as
 uh
 Fed
 easing


bullish,
 AI
 trade
 for
 earnings
 bullish,


therefore
 volatility,
 yes,
 but
 overall


bullish,
 and
 then
 midterms
 is
 the
 larger


overhang
 that
 should
 secure
 it
 being


bullish.


>> How
 about
 this?
 We're
 forgetting
 one
 big


component.
 You
 may
 have
 a
 housing
 market


that
 gets
 unlocked
 also
 and
 more
 job,


more
 trade
 jobs,
 more
 people
 working,


real
 estate
 brokers
 making
 more
 money,


homeowners
 doing
 more
 projects,
 more


capital
 being
 spent
 at
 Lowe's
 and
 Home


Depot.
 So,
 we
 have
 a
 whole
 another


segment
 of
 the
 economy
 that
 may
 actually


pick
 up
 next
 year
 because
 rates
 may
 get


down
 to
 a
 point
 where
 people
 start
 doing


additions
 on
 their
 homes
 or
 putting
 a


new
 roof
 on
 or
 change
 in
 the
 windows
 and


doing
 projects
 around
 the
 house
 that


they
 held
 off
 on
 because
 they
 didn't


want
 to
 tap
 a
 heliloc
 or
 something.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 the
 housing
 market
 opening


up
 would
 be
 really
 exciting.
 Now,
 we


need
 these
 freaking
 rates
 to
 come
 down,


which
 yields
 are
 not
 coming
 down
 even


after
 the
 rate
 cuts.
 But
 if
 they
 do,


then
 yes,
 it
 does
 open
 up
 the
 housing


market
 dramatically.


>> And
 think
 about
 it
 like
 this.
 Q4,
 we're


going
 to
 have
 positive
 GDP.
 There
 is
 no


indication
 that
 we're
 going to
 have


negative
 GDP
 in
 Q4.
 And
 if
 the
 Fed
 is


calling
 for
 positive
 GDP
 next
 year,
 then


the
 likelihood
 of
 having
 three
 out
 of


four
 quarters
 in
 the
 black
 is
 pretty


strong.
 And
 you
 need
 two
 negative


quarters
 to
 have
 a
 technical
 recession.


So
 if
 we
 get
 three
 quarters
 next
 year


that
 are
 in
 the
 black,
 that
 means
 a


recession
 is
 not
 happening.
 So,


I
 don't
 think
 a
 recession
 is
 as
 likely


as
 it
 once
 was,
 especially
 if


unemployment
 starts
 to
 soften.
 You


combine
 that
 with
 the
 lower
 rate


environment.
 You
 combine
 that
 when
 a


housing
 market
 opens
 up,
 and
 you
 combine


that
 with
 expanded
 earnings,
 especially


in
 the
 broad
 market,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


pretty
 hard
 for
 the
 market
 to
 be
 flat
 or


go
 down
 next
 year.


>> No,
 I
 agree.
 I
 really
 do.
 And
 that's
 why


it's
 a
 little
 confusing.


the
 argument
 for
 a
 massive
 massive
 draw


down
 without
 an
 explanation
 for
 how
 it


would
 happen.
 Then
 again,
 maybe


something
 happens
 and
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.


But
 uh
 and
 no
 one
 can
 fully
 predict
 it.


It
 just
 it
 it
 it
 feels
 like
 the


thematics
 around
 housing
 midterms,
 Fed


easing,
 uh
 general
 market
 participation


growing,
 rates
 coming
 down,
 and
 then
 the


AI
 trade
 being
 intact.


I
 don't
 want
 to
 pick
 on


a
 certain
 company,
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 use
 a


different
 one.
 Um,
 maybe
 we
 have
 to


normalize
 companies
 not
 getting
 head


over
 heels
 on
 their
 skis.
 Maybe


companies
 like
 Aqua
 and
 SMR
 have
 no


business
 going
 to
 where
 they
 went
 to.


Maybe
 Cornweave
 has
 no
 business
 going
 to


180
 before
 it's
 actually
 proven
 that


they
 can
 put
 up
 profitability.


And
 maybe
 we
 need
 to
 stop
 normalizing


those
 things
 because
 that
 just
 allows


the
 bears
 to
 call
 things
 out
 and
 try
 to


create
 a
 perception
 based
 off
 of
 things


that
 just
 become
 memes
 for
 a
 lack
 of
 a


better
 word
 because
 what
 Corewave
 and


Nebus
 and
 those
 companies
 going
 up
 to


crazy
 levels
 and
 Aquo
 and
 SMR,
 they
 have


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 the
 largest
 companies


that
 control
 50%
 of
 the
 S&P.
 I
 mean,


what
 the
 top
 30
 companies
 is
 like
 50%
 of


the
 S&P.
 So,


a
 lot
 of
 them
 trade
 at
 good
 valuations.


>> I'm
 happy
 you
 didn't
 say
 Rocket
 Lab.


>> No,
 I'm
 trying
 not
 to
 pick
 on
 certain


companies.


I'm
 trying.
 But
 no,
 I
 mean
 it's
 serious


because
 it
 just
 gives
 the
 bears


something
 to
 point
 out
 saying,
 "Well,
 we


must
 be
 in
 a
 bubble
 because
 these


companies
 don't
 even
 make
 money
 and
 look


at
 the
 valuation
 they're
 getting
 or


these
 companies
 do
 just
 a
 couple
 of


billion
 in
 revenue
 or
 not
 even
 a
 billion


in
 revenue
 and
 look
 at
 the
 valuation."


And
 they
 try
 to
 highlight
 that
 because


they
 know
 they
 can't
 say
 anything
 about


the
 companies
 that
 have
 a
 hundred


billion
 in
 cash
 on
 hand
 generating
 over


a hundred
 billion
 in
 free
 cash
 flow
 or


operating
 income.
 So,


>> no,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 there
 was
 a
 day
 in


October
 where
 I
 went
 on
 a
 really
 big


rant
 about
 Oaklo.
 It
 was
 at
 140,
 down


from
 like
 180,
 190
 that
 day.
 I
 think
 it


was
 down
 for
 like
 20%
 for
 the
 week.
 And


I
 was
 like,
 this
 thing
 doesn't
 deserve


to
 be
 here.
 And
 it's
 healthy
 if
 this


thing


continues
 to
 go
 down
 because
 this
 is


this
 is
 perfect
 evidence
 for
 bears
 to
 be


like,
 look
 at
 this
 clown
 market,


Oklahoma.


>> And
 you
 can't
 actually
 get
 mad
 at
 them


for
 saying
 that.


So
 the
 more
 the
 nonsense
 gets
 flushed


out,
 which
 you
 know
 to
 an
 extent
 S&P
 is


back
 at
 close
 alltime
 highs.
 Oaklo's
 at


87
 from
 198.
 So
 we've
 seen
 it's
 not


saying
 OK
 is
 a
 bad
 company.
 It's
 just


say
 there's
 no
 revenue.
 There's
 not
 even


the
 potential
 of
 any
 revenue.
 There's
 no


deals
 in
 the
 like
 there's
 nothing
 there.


>> And
 it
 just
 goes
 to
 show
 you
 that
 those


companies
 don't
 mean
 a
 single
 thing
 for


the
 S&P.
 If
 they
 did,
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 at


alltime
 highs.


>> Yeah.


>> Doesn't
 have
 anything
 to
 do
 with
 market


sentiment
 or
 anything.
 And
 the
 thing
 is


those
 companies
 have
 narratives,
 right?


Because
 Oaklo's
 in
 the
 energy
 space,


nuclear,
 big
 deal,
 data
 centers,
 what
 if


they
 get
 a
 $5
 billion
 contract
 tomorrow


by
 the
 DOE?
 Like
 that
 changes


everything.
 So
 that
 narrative
 is
 keeping


them
 afloat.
 But
 then
 we
 have
 to
 ask


ourselves
 as
 investors,
 do
 we
 really


think
 it's
 healthy
 for
 a
 narrative
 to


keep
 a
 stock
 afloat
 at
 the
 level
 that


it's
 afloat,
 aka
 no
 earnings,
 no


revenue,
 but
 this
 narrative
 is
 enough
 to


make
 it
 worth$10
 billion.
 Some
 stocks


get
 away
 with
 that,
 but
 not
 every
 stock


can.
 And
 we
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 stocks
 in


October,
 November
 that
 were
 getting
 away


with
 it,
 and
 they
 ended
 up
 getting
 hit.


Well,
 I'll
 tell
 you,
 I
 called
 one
 of
 my


buddies
 today
 and
 he
 was
 like,
 I'm


getting
 absolutely
 killed
 in
 the
 I'm


like,
 what
 are
 you
 talking
 about?
 You're


getting
 killed
 in
 the
 market.
 And
 he


told
 me
 how
 much
 he
 was
 down
 today.
 I'm


like,
 Jesus
 Christ,
 you
 need
 to
 stop


gambling
 on
 this
 [ __ ]


>> How
 much
 was
 he
 down?


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 say.


>> You
 don't
 We
 don't
 know
 who
 this
 friend.


It
 could
 be
 some
 it
 could
 be
 some


imaginary
 character.
 It
 doesn't
 matter.


>> Um,
 let's
 just
 say


>> we
 have
 no
 idea
 who


>> I
 I
 I
 I
 really
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 because


people
 may
 be
 able
 to
 figure
 it
 out.


Let's
 just
 say
 that
 somebody
 was
 down


quite
 a
 bit
 on
 companies
 that
 are
 just


straight
 flyers
 because
 they've
 been


doing
 very
 well
 on
 flyers
 and
 I've
 been


trying
 to
 talk
 them
 out
 of
 doing
 this


degenerate
 stuff.


>> And
 these
 are
 options
 or


>> no
 straight
 equity?


But
 it's
 highly
 volatile
 markets.
 Um


stuff
 that's
 going
 for
 uh


FDA
 phase
 three
 approvals,
 that
 type
 of


stuff.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 once
 again,
 it's
 all
 speculative


stuff.
 I
 mean,
 and
 it
 just
 goes
 back
 if


you
 were
 in
 Apple,
 if
 you
 were
 buying


Apple
 at
 170,
 not
 listening
 to
 people,


and
 it's
 at
 280
 and
 it
 goes
 to
 260,
 do


you
 really
 care?


>> You
 don't
 you
 you
 cannot
 give
 a
 [ __ ]


>> No,
 you
 don't.


And
 if
 you
 do
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 you
 just
 you


have
 you
 have
 some
 you
 have
 some
 issues


in
 life.
 Like
 your
 stock
 falls
 20
 bucks


and
 you
 bought
 it
 80
 bucks
 ago.
 You
 you


can't
 be
 that
 concerned,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 thing
 is


everybody
 needs
 to
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and


really
 get
 a
 mentality
 of,
 okay,
 I'm


still
 up.
 Where
 else
 would
 I
 have
 made


this
 profit?
 And
 maybe
 I
 don't
 have
 as


much
 money
 as
 I
 did
 yesterday,
 but
 it's


still
 on
 paper.
 You
 still
 own
 the
 asset.


It
 can
 still
 go
 up
 next
 week.
 And
 the


sky
 is
 not
 falling.
 It
 has
 no
 bearing
 on


what
 you
 do
 tonight
 or
 what
 you
 do
 over


the
 weekends.


>> Agreed.
 I
 agree.
 Um
 Oh,
 thank
 you
 for


the
 super
 chat.
 What
 if
 private
 equity


or
 commercial
 real
 estate
 crash
 that


would
 cause
 a
 large
 downward
 swing?
 Yes,


I
 have
 not
 done
 a
 ton
 of
 research


definitely
 into
 commercial
 real
 estate.


I've
 done
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 into
 private


equity.
 I
 mean,
 maybe.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


we're
 actually
 in
 a
 private
 equity


bubble,
 but


>> interesting
 enough,
 did
 you
 listen
 to


Allin
 this
 week?


I
 did
 not.


>> You
 need
 to
 listen
 to
 AllIn
 because
 they


have
 a
 very
 big
 conversation
 around


private
 equity
 because
 of
 the
 new


taxation
 rules
 that
 are
 up
 on
 the
 ballot


in
 California.
 And
 it
 is
 very


interesting
 what
 they
 start
 saying.


>> Are
 wait,
 so
 are
 they
 bearish
 private


equity
 or


>> I
 wouldn't
 say
 bearish,
 but
 they're


talking
 about
 having
 to
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


legit
 wealth
 tax.
 I
 think
 the
 numbers


the
 people
 in
 the
 chat
 will
 be
 able
 to


tell
 you.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 they
 would
 have


to
 pay
 a
 5%
 unrealized
 gain
 or
 a
 10%


unrealized
 gain
 on
 private
 equity
 that


is
 illquid
 that
 they
 can't
 even
 sell.
 If


they
 have
 to
 sell
 it,
 it'll
 be
 at
 a
 deep


discount.


And
 basically
 they
 said
 this
 is
 going
 to


deincentivize
 people
 to
 invest,


deincentivize
 people
 to
 work
 and
 people


who
 have
 money
 instead
 of
 building
 new


companies
 or
 taking
 chances
 they


basically
 be
 like
 I'm
 rich.
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 retire
 and
 do
 nothing.


>> Okay.
 So
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 private
 equity


is
 a
 bubble
 or
 not
 but
 can
 we
 all
 agree


why
 the
 hell
 would
 anyone
 want
 to
 be
 in


private
 like
 what
 any
 retail
 investor
 if


your
 bank
 says
 hey
 John
 we
 have
 this


private
 equity
 offering
 for
 your
 401k


like
 in
 what
 world
 do
 you
 think
 that's


an
 exciting
 opport
 like
 a
 startup
 is


different
 that
 potentially
 you
 know


could
 be
 a
 10backer
 one
 day
 but
 like


some
 random
 business
 that
 has
 some
 good


IBIDA
 margins
 it's
 like
 meta's
 trading


at
 18
 times
 why
 wouldn't
 you
 just
 like


I've
 never
 found
 the
 fascination
 around


private
 equity
 at
 all


and
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 being
 pitched
 as


exit
 liquidity
 quite
 frankly.


>> That's
 a
 great
 way
 of
 putting
 it.
 It's


being
 pitched
 as
 exit
 liquidity
 because


it's
 an
 offramp
 for
 people
 who
 work


there
 to
 sell
 their
 shares
 that
 there's


no
 market
 for


>> and
 I
 think
 what
 it
 also
 is


psychologically
 is
 people
 feel
 cool
 that


they're
 invested
 in
 something
 private


when
 in
 reality
 if
 you
 keep
 up
 with
 the


markets
 if
 you
 spend
 even
 an
 hour
 a
 day


on
 it
 you
 you
 know
 enough
 to
 say
 look
 I


met Meta
 is
 a
 discount.
 It's
 a
 deal.
 I


don't
 need
 to
 get
 in
 touch
 with
 my


friend
 who
 knows
 a
 guy
 to
 get
 me
 into


some
 private
 thing
 that
 doesn't
 have


some
 exponential
 AI
 startup
 potential,


but
 it's
 just
 like
 some
 random
 cool


thing
 that
 you
 can
 have
 in
 your
 401k.


>> And
 here's
 the
 problem,
 you'll
 never
 see


a
 financial
 statement.
 You'll
 never


actually
 know
 what
 they're
 doing
 and


it's
 just
 much
 harder
 to
 track.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 I'
 I've
 not
 found
 the


fascination
 with
 private
 equity,
 but
 I


do
 understand
 the
 concern.
 And
 yes,
 that


is
 something
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 keep


an
 eye
 on.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 next


year.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean,
 the
 only
 way
 that


commercial
 real
 estate
 has
 a
 very
 big


downturn
 is
 if
 people
 start
 turning
 over


the
 keys
 because
 they
 can't
 make
 the


unit
 of
 economics
 work
 for
 running
 the


building.
 But
 as
 we've
 seen,
 when
 you


look
 at
 at
 go
 read
 SL
 Green's
 Q3


transcript,
 they're
 at
 92%
 occupancy
 and


they're
 expecting
 to
 get
 to
 over
 93%
 by


the
 end
 of
 Q4.
 So
 that's
 a
 really
 high


level.
 And
 everybody
 was
 worried
 about


New
 York
 City
 real
 estate.
 So


>> well,
 the
 commercial
 real
 estate


concerns
 in
 2023
 ended
 up
 never


materializing,
 right?
 So
 they
 have
 I


don't
 know
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 re


>> And
 how
 about
 this?
 the
 the
 narrative


around
 it.
 Well,
 rates
 are
 so
 high,


interest
 is
 going
 up,
 they're
 gonna


they're
 gonna
 have
 to
 refy
 at
 higher


rates,
 it's
 going
 to
 destroy
 their


margins,
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 Well,


yeah,
 that
 didn't
 happen.
 And
 now
 you're


getting
 a
 low
 rate
 environment.
 And
 if


rates
 go
 to
 two
 and
 a
 half,
 there's


really
 no
 fear
 on
 debt
 at
 this
 point


unless
 companies


take
 less
 space.
 But
 that's
 not
 the


trends
 we're
 seeing.


I
 mean,
 you
 look
 at
 realy
 income,
 they


still
 have
 over
 a
 90%
 occupancy
 rate.


>> Yeah.


You
 want
 to
 see
 something
 cool?


>> You
 can
 tell
 me
 because
 I
 can't
 look
 at


my
 phone
 because
 I'm
 driving.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 I'll
 share
 this.
 I
 didn't


know
 they
 were
 going
 to
 do
 this,
 guys,


but
 we
 got
 the
 Nvidia
 account
 to
 post
 my


interview.


>> Wait,
 what?


>> We
 got
 the
 Nvidia
 X
 account
 to
 post
 the


interview.
 join
 Amit
 as
 he
 sits
 down


with
 Justin,
 VP
 of
 Enterprise
 A,
 Nvidia.


>> Oh,
 that's
 amazing.
 Congrats,


>> dude.
 They
 didn't
 tell
 me
 they
 were


going
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 didn't
 even
 I
 didn't


even
 send
 them
 the
 footage.
 They
 must


have
 downloaded
 from
 my
 YouTube
 channel


and
 clipped
 it
 themselves.


>> Jensen's
 next


>> and
 we
 can
 get
 Jensen.


Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Imagine
 we
 get
 Jensen
 on


>> Imagine
 we
 get
 Jensen
 on
 day
 the
 stocks


down
 10%.
 I
 gotta
 get
 them
 to
 let
 me
 do


a
 live
 stream,
 not
 some
 pre-recorded


podcast
 [ __ ]
 I
 want
 to
 do
 a
 live


stream.
 We're
 be
 looking
 at
 this
 like


Jensen,
 you
 just
 lost
 400
 billion
 in


market
 cap.
 Like,


what's
 going
 on?
 Like,
 could
 you


imagine?


>> I
 obviously


>> I
 mean,
 that
 would
 be
 great.
 Congrats.


That's
 awesome
 that
 Nvidia
 did
 that.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 didn't
 expect
 them
 to
 do
 that,


but
 that's
 pretty
 cool.
 For
 those
 that


haven't
 seen
 the
 interview,
 I'll
 link
 it


in
 the
 chat.
 But,
 um,
 again,
 that


interview
 and
 again,
 I
 talked
 about
 it


on
 Monday.
 I
 talked
 to
 one
 of
 Nvidia's


direct
 reports
 or
 Jensen's
 director.
 He


has
 30
 of
 them.
 And
 this
 guy
 Justin


who's
 been
 there
 since
 2008,
 he
 is
 one


of
 his
 he's
 like
 like
 every
 single
 day


he
 has
 to
 talk
 with
 Jensen.
 I
 mean
 the


work
 ethic
 he
 described,
 the
 level
 of


opportunity,
 the
 fact
 that
 Jensen
 barely


sleeps
 because
 he's
 going
 after
 this


vision
 of
 changing
 the
 world
 with
 AI.


You
 listen
 to
 that
 and
 then
 you
 hear,


oh,
 Oracle
 delayed
 a
 data
 center
 with


open
 AI
 and
 then
 Nvidia's
 down
 10%.
 It's


like
 two
 vastly
 different
 perspectives


when
 you
 hear
 someone
 who's
 in
 the
 in


the
 thick
 of
 it
 every
 day
 with
 Jensen


versus
 a
 headline
 that
 says
 AI
 is
 done


because
 of
 a
 delay
 data
 center
 delay.


>> Well,
 and
 think
 about
 this.
 Does
 one


data
 center
 delay
 change
 all
 the
 GPUs


that
 are
 already
 solved?
 Are
 they
 going


to
 get
 unsold?


>> Yeah.
 And
 it's
 also
 like,
 bro,
 Oracle


came
 out
 and
 said
 there's
 no
 delays
 to


our
 timelines.
 So
 Oracle
 was
 kind
 of


implying
 we
 were
 always
 going
 to
 start


at
 a
 different
 time.
 I
 don't
 know
 why


you
 guys
 thought
 we
 were
 starting


earlier
 than
 expected,
 but
 they
 said


there's
 no
 delays.
 We
 have
 discussed


with
 open
 eye
 since
 the
 beginning
 when


we
 wanted
 to
 start
 and
 maybe
 you
 guys


are
 figuring
 it
 out.
 It's
 later
 than
 you


expected,
 but
 we
 never
 said
 it
 was


starting
 next
 month.


>> And
 how
 much?


>> They
 have
 593
 billion
 in
 RPO.
 If
 Open
 AI


is
 delayed
 on
 their
 timeline,
 got
 news


for
 everybody,
 that's
 not
 593
 billion


from
 Open
 AI.
 There's
 other
 people
 that


need
 freaking
 data
 center
 services
 from


Oracle.
 That
 will
 get
 filled.
 There's
 no


reason
 to
 worry.


>> It
 should
 get
 filled.
 That
 is
 correct.


It
 should
 get
 filled.
 Which
 is
 why
 again


the
 concerns
 today
 were
 just
 the
 fact


that
 that
 took
 down
 the
 like
 dude
 the


entire
 week's
 gains
 after
 the
 most


doubbish
 pal
 we've
 seen
 in
 two
 years


gone
 because
 of
 that
 headline.
 It
 goes


to
 show
 how
 fragile
 this
 market
 still
 is


on
 this
 AI
 narrative.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 I
 just
 figured
 out
 the


title
 for
 my
 tweet.


>> I
 figured
 out
 the
 title
 for
 my
 tweet.
 AI


bears.
 Thank
 you.
 Take
 the
 market
 lower


so
 I
 can
 buy
 more.


>> I
 love
 it.


I
 love
 it.
 I
 mean,
 if
 they're
 going
 to


give
 us
 Nvidia
 at
 130,
 140.
 All right,


dude.


>> I
 mean,
 do
 the
 math
 on
 video
 130.
 I


mean,
 that
 gets
 to
 be
 You're
 talking


about
 a
 tobacco
 company
 at
 that
 point
 on


a
 forward
 basis.


>> I
 mean,
 seriously,


>> tobacco
 Morris
 may
 actually
 be
 more


expensive
 on
 a
 forward
 basis
 than
 Nvidia


if
 we
 put
 it
 at
 130.


>> Yeah.
 No.
 Again,
 it's
 a
 No
 one's


complaining
 about
 Philip
 Morris's


multiple
 or
 Costco's
 multiple,
 but


they're
 complaining
 about
 Nvidia's


multiple,
 which
 is
 the
 part
 that
 tends


to
 be
 annoying.


>> Like
 either
 Costco
 is a
 bubble
 or
 Nvidia


needs
 to
 come
 down
 and
 Costco
 both
 need


they
 both
 need
 to
 come
 down,
 but


Nvidia's
 already
 further
 down
 from


Costco.


Once
 again,
 one
 of
 them
 does


120
 billion
 run
 rate
 on
 net
 income
 and


the
 other
 does
 eight
 billion
 and
 one
 of


the
 companies
 does
 the
 entire
 year
 for


the
 other
 company
 in
 less
 than
 four


weeks
 for
 net
 income.
 It
 just
 doesn't


make
 sense.
 I
 mean,
 I
 showed
 you
 those


numbers
 without
 putting
 labels
 on
 those


companies.
 Did
 that
 make
 sense
 last


night
 that
 Nvidia
 does
 Costco's
 net


income
 in
 three
 and
 a
 half
 weeks,
 yet


Costco
 is
 a
 bigger
 multiple?


That's
 a
 fair
 point.
 It's
 a
 very


>> I
 mean,
 at
 what
 point
 do
 we
 set
 call
 a


spade
 a
 spade?
 And
 I've
 always
 had
 this


argument.
 Everybody
 thinks
 I'm
 crazy
 for


looking
 at
 it
 like
 this.
 And
 I


understand
 this
 is
 not
 the
 only
 way
 to


look
 at
 things,
 but
 $1
 equal
 equals
 $1.


And
 10%
 growth
 equals
 10%
 growth.
 It


does
 not
 matter
 if
 you
 sell
 widgets
 or


AI.
 If
 you
 generate
 a
 million
 dollars
 in


revenue
 and
 you
 grow
 by
 50%.
 And
 you


have
 two
 separate
 companies
 doing
 the


same
 numbers,
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


it's
 the
 same
 exact
 numbers,
 but
 they'll


have
 different
 multiples.
 Why
 is
 that?
 I


mean,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 there
 should
 be
 one


set
 of
 standards,
 but
 when
 you
 look
 at


the
 standard
 deviation,
 this
 is
 insane


how
 out
 of
 whack
 we
 are
 on
 a
 dollar


for-dollar
 basis.
 It
 does
 not
 make
 any


sense.


Have
 you
 ever
 worn
 a
 scarf?


>> Scarf?


>> Yeah.


>> The
 only
 time
 I
 have
 worn
 a
 scarf
 is


when
 my
 office
 was
 down
 on
 uh
 34th
 and


10th
 and
 the
 wind
 was
 coming
 so
 fiercely


off
 you
 needed
 it
 to
 cover
 your
 face.


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 scarfves
 are
 my
 new


thing,
 dude.


>> Why?


Well,
 I
 wore
 a
 scarf
 today
 during
 the


market
 open
 and
 outside
 of
 people
 saying


I
 look
 like
 I'm
 from
 the
 Taliban.
 It
 was


like


>> inside.


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 toasty.


>> I
 mean,
 look,
 listen.
 If
 you're
 in
 a


wind
 tunnel,
 like
 where
 where
 we
 were


with
 Uncle
 Jacks,
 okay,
 that
 becomes
 a


wind
 tunnel
 off
 the
 river
 right
 there.


And
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 winter,
 it
 is


excruciating
 that
 wind.
 It
 It's
 crazy


how
 strong
 it
 gets.
 Okay,
 so
 scarf
 hat.


Yeah,
 no
 problem.
 But
 you're
 if
 you're


talking
 about
 wear
 scarf
 inside,
 you've


lost
 your
 minds,


>> bro.
 I'm
 freaking
 warm.
 Like,
 if
 I
 did


this
 on
 Saturday,
 I
 wouldn't
 have
 missed


the
 show
 on
 Monday.
 Like,


>> do
 you
 really
 think
 you
 got
 sick
 because


you
 didn't
 wear
 a
 scarf?


>> Yes,
 dude.
 I'm
 telling
 you,
 my
 throat,


it
 it
 caught
 something.
 Like,
 I'm
 it


like
 because
 I
 didn't
 have
 a
 fever.
 I


didn't
 have
 an
 infection.


It's
 it's
 it's
 either
 that
 or
 I
 was


exhausted
 and
 maybe
 the
 exhaustion


caught
 up.
 But


>> well,
 we
 know
 you
 weren't
 exhausted


because
 you
 sleep
 more
 than
 anybody
 I


know.


>> That's
 not
 true.
 I
 do
 not
 sleep
 more


than
 everybody.


>> Okay.
 Sure.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 you're
 going
 live


today,
 right?
 Are
 you
 going
 live
 before


you
 go
 live
 or


>> I'm
 think
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 it.
 I
 mean,


what
 time
 are
 you
 doing
 your
 thing
 or


not?
 Oh
 yeah.
 So,
 um,
 yeah,
 7:30
 I'll
 be


live.
 So,
 for
 those
 that
 are
 done
 for


the
 weekend,
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 Sunday


for
 the
 market
 futures.
 I
 will
 be
 live


again
 tonight
 at
 7:30
 with
 my
 new


manager
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 uh


announcing
 a
 lot
 of
 updates
 for
 the


channel.
 If
 anyone
 wants
 to
 come
 to
 the


New
 York
 City
 meetup,
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 cap


on
 the
 amount
 of
 people
 at
 the
 meetup.


We're
 capping
 it
 off
 at
 300.
 So,
 the


first
 details
 will
 be
 out
 tonight
 and


you'll
 be
 able
 to
 get
 all
 those
 details.


Yeah,
 that'll
 be
 from
 like
 7:30
 to
 like


8:30.


>> All right.
 I
 may
 go
 live
 from
 6:30
 to


7:30.
 Then
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 live
 when


you're
 live.


>> Okay.


>> In
 fact,
 I
 think
 I
 will
 go
 live
 at
 6:30


at
 7:30
 and
 go
 on
 an
 AI
 rant
 so
 I
 can


flush
 out
 some
 ideas
 for
 the
 X
 post.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 you
 had
 two
 of
 those


big
 X
 posts.
 One
 of
 them
 went
 really


viral,
 so
 I
 think
 you
 should
 do
 another


one.
 Yeah,
 one
 of
 them
 got
 over
 two


million
 views.


>> That's
 true.
 That
 is
 true.


>> And
 I
 feel
 like
 now's
 the
 time
 to
 do
 it


with
 everything
 going
 haywire.


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 So,
 I'll
 link
 your
 channel.


So,
 Steve
 will
 be
 going
 live
 in
 30


minutes.
 I'll
 be
 going
 live
 in
 an
 hour


and
 30
 minutes
 again.
 And
 again,
 that


stream
 is
 really
 just
 going
 to
 be


introducing
 her
 to
 the
 channel.
 She's


going
 to
 be
 playing
 a
 big
 role
 next
 year


and
 really
 helping
 me
 manage
 a
 lot
 of


different
 stuff
 going
 on.
 and
 a
 lot
 of


details
 on
 the
 meetups
 that
 will
 be
 out


as
 well.


Um,
 and
 that
 should
 be
 pretty
 much
 it.


Look,
 overall
 it
 was
 a
 decent
 week.


S&P's
 less
 than
 a
 percent
 away
 from


alltime
 highs
 and
 Broadcom
 and
 Oracle,


although
 their
 calls
 kind
 of
 sucked,
 had


good
 earnings.
 So,
 can't
 be
 too
 upset.


>> Let's
 end
 it
 with
 Let's
 end
 it
 with


this.
 People
 are
 getting
 crazy
 yet
 the


S&P
 is
 a
 percentage
 point
 off
 of
 alltime


highs.
 How
 silly
 do
 we
 sound?


>> Yeah.


So,


>> oh,
 I
 agree.


I
 agree.
 It
 can't
 be
 that
 I
 if
 there's
 a


rotation
 happening
 and
 that's
 why,
 you


know,
 Nvidia
 is
 not
 at
 200.
 I
 can
 live


with
 that.
 But
 S&P
 that
 was
 down
 seven,


eight%
 and
 then
 Nvidia
 st
 like
 that's


where
 like,
 okay,
 there's
 a
 market


problem.
 There's
 not
 a
 market
 problem


here.
 There's
 a
 AI
 bubble
 narrative


problem,
 which
 is
 fine,
 but
 broader


market,
 the
 fact
 that
 Eli
 Liy
 and


Goldman
 Sachs
 are
 at
 all
 time
 highs,


that's
 okay.
 That's
 that's
 good.
 That's


healthy.


So,
 it's
 not
 bad
 to
 see
 that
 type
 of


broader
 market
 move.


All
 right,
 that
 is
 it
 for
 us,
 folks.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.


Hopefully,
 everyone
 enjoyed
 their
 week.


Uh,
 I
 will
 see
 you
 guys
 back
 on
 Sunday.


Steve
 will
 be
 live
 on
 I
 think
 Steve,
 you


do
 stocks
 and
 coffees
 every
 Sunday
 now,


right?
 So,
 Steve
 will
 probably
 be
 live


on
 Sunday
 again.
 And
 um


yeah,
 I'll
 see
 everybody
 tonight
 in
 a


bit.
 Steve's
 YouTube
 right
 there
 in
 the


chat.
 He'll
 see
 you
 guys
 in
 30
 minutes.


And


that's
 pretty
 much
 it.
 We'll
 be
 back


later
 tonight
 and
 then
 on
 Sunday.


There's
 YouTube
 right
 there.


John
 seen
 his
 last
 match
 ever
 tomorrow.


Okay.
 I
 thought
 his
 last
 match
 was
 like


10
 years
 ago,
 but
 he
 seems
 to
 keep


coming
 back.
 I
 think
 of
 my
 poem.
 By
 the


way,
 guys,
 I
 still
 got
 to
 think
 of
 my


poem.
 So,
 Steve
 doesn't
 know
 that
 I've


become
 a
 poet,
 but
 I'll
 uh
 I'll
 have
 a


poem
 by
 Monday.
 Hopefully,
 better
 than


the
 poem
 I
 had
 today.
 Although,
 the
 poem


I
 had
 today,
 I
 don't
 think
 it
 was
 it


didn't
 end
 up
 rhyming
 at
 the
 end,
 which


I
 guess
 is
 the
 function
 of
 the
 poem.


Wait,
 so
 it
 that's
 a
 haiku
 then,
 right?


Haikus.


Do
 haikus
 rhyme?


Am
 I
 saying
 it
 right?


Haiku
 po.
 Okay,
 so
 I
 had
 a
 poem.
 It
 just


wasn't
 a
 It
 was
 a
 haiku.
 That's
 all
 it


was.


Look,
 ha
 coup
 poems
 do
 not
 rhyme.
 So
 you


can
 still
 be
 a
 poet
 and
 not
 rhyme.
 So


that's
 what
 we
 have
 today.
 So
 I


appreciate
 everyone
 who
 enjoyed
 the


haiku


instead
 of
 a
 regular
 poem.


All
 right,
 that's
 it
 for
 me.
 Thank


everybody.
 I'll
 be
 back
 at
 7:30.
 We'll


have
 a
 lot
 more
 details
 on
 the
 future
 of


the
 channel,
 meetups,
 all
 that
 stuff.


and
 uh
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


Thanks
 everybody.
 Appreciate
 it.
 If
 I


don't
 see
 you,
 enjoy
 your
 weekend
 and


I'll
 see
 you
 Sunday
 for
 the
 market


futures.
 Bye
 everybody.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
