A series of debates about privilege have recently emerged online.
Someone even invented a "Taiwan Privilege Scale" to measure everyone's privilege.
For example, the parents all have a college degree or above.
My family owns a residence in Taipei City.
Your family is helping you plan your studies abroad.
Let everyone check their privileges
It went viral online after being published.
Why exactly did this issue of privilege ignite controversy?
How did the concept of privilege first emerge?
How do sociologists explain privilege?
In today's episode, we'll talk about...
What exactly is class privilege?
How does class determine our fate?
How could we possibly transcend class privilege?
The Rise of the Term "Privilege"
It originated in 1988.
American activist Peggy McIntosh published an article
White Privilege and Male Privilege
In this article, she defines privilege as
An advantage that was not earned through one's own efforts (unearned advantage)
A privilege scale was also listed.
46 questions were raised to examine white privilege
Like, would your neighbors be kind to you if they saw you?
Will I be watched by security guards while shopping?
What are these?
White privilege glasses.
Helps you see the world as we see it.
...???
After this article was published
The concept of privilege has begun to spark much debate in American academia.
People started discussing so-called white privilege, male privilege, and class privilege.
Because this social debate is about class privilege.
This episode focuses on the issue of class.
First, let's define what class privilege is.
It's not about getting it by yourself.
Rather, it is an advantage gained from one's class of origin.
Like growing up in a wealthy family
Your parents invest more money in you
This is not something you achieved through your own efforts.
It's simply a matter of being born into the right family.
These advantages will give you
To understand class privilege
We can imagine life as a race.
So-called class privilege is
Your class of origin gives you a head start.
On the contrary
If it's an advantage you earned through your own efforts
It will not be called a privilege
On the contrary, they will say that you truly deserve it.
At this point, some people might object to saying
However, advantage is a relative concept.
As long as you compare yourself with people who are less capable than you.
You have more advantages.
This will lead to a very absurd result.
In impoverished countries, the poor are often seen as privileged individuals, much like Taiwanese people.
Because Taiwanese people don't have to face famine.
However, being able to have three meals a day and avoid hunger is a normal phenomenon.
Just like the basic rights to life and education.
This is called a "basic human right," not a "privilege."
Because we would consider this a normal life that everyone in society should have.
Therefore, the definition of privilege needs to be supplemented with another condition.
Privilege only exists when there is a significant deviation from the normal standard.
This is the only way to avoid confusing privilege with fundamental human rights.
Freedom from hunger should be a human right, not a privilege.
Let me give you another example.
Many white people living in Taiwan
They would be accused of enjoying white privilege.
Because they teach English in Taiwan.
They can earn higher salaries than teachers who are Taiwanese citizens.
Enjoy better treatment
Clearly speaking in terms of strength
Taiwanese teachers may have more English licenses and training.
However, white foreign teachers receive a significantly higher salary simply because they are white.
This is not something they achieved through hard work.
This is a form of white privilege.
So, in terms of class
Who are the privileged class in Taiwan?
According to the "Household Wealth Distribution Statistics" released by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics in 2024.
The median household wealth in Taiwan is NT$8.94 million.
If your family's wealth reaches this figure
That's more than 50% of people who have PR.
From which line should we begin to define the privileged class?
It depends on how we define the middle class.
In fact, the middle class is a very broad and difficult-to-define concept.
According to a survey by AIA Life Insurance (2015)
They surveyed 2,500 middle-class individuals from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.
Taiwanese people who consider themselves middle class
On average, they have assets of NT$7 million.
Average household monthly income: NT$140,000
And these middle-class standards of financial security
The assets need to accumulate to 28.5 million.
Therefore, we can range from 7 million to 28.5 million.
Classified as middle class
It's roughly between PR45 and PR85.
Families with a national PR of 85 or higher are considered wealthy.
Because privilege is a relative concept.
For the average working class
The middle class and above are considered privileged classes.
Please note
Sociologists explore whether a certain group of people have privileges.
Not a moral proposition
I'm not accusing you of having a problem.
Rather, it indicates that there is a problem with the system.
Always granting privileges to a certain class
This does not mean that people with privileges are morally flawed.
It seems to be an original sin.
If you understand class privilege as a doctrine of original sin
You just didn't understand what the sociologists were talking about.
Whether you have privileges or not has nothing to do with your subjective intentions.
It has nothing to do with whether you are a good person or a bad person.
The key lies in your social class position.
So when sociologists say that the upper class enjoys privileges...
This is not an accusation that they are bad people.
Rather, it's saying that inequality exists within this system.
This is why some people enjoy more privileges from birth.
Born with a winning hand
We can use the analogy of Monopoly to describe this situation.
Imagine four people playing Monopoly.
After everyone has played one round
Some people win money, some people lose money.
In the second round, four other people will play.
We usually start a new game.
Therefore, the starting points are the same.
But imagine it.
If the game rules were changed now...
They must inherit the roles of the previous four people.
Therefore, someone must inherit a large fortune from the beginning.
We would say that such a game is unfair.
Because someone enjoyed privileges from the beginning.
This is not an insult to the person.
Rather, it means you participated in this unequal structure.
Therefore, sociologists use the word "privilege".
It is to point out the flaws in the system that a certain person is involved in.
To give an advantage to people of a certain class, race, or gender
Therefore, the real focus of our discussion should be class.
Instead of privilege
Because class is the root of privilege.
In the book *Understanding Class*
Author Erik Olin Wright distinguishes three ways of understanding class.
The first type is called
individual attribute
It's about understanding why some people can win at the starting line.
How are privileges accumulated from childhood?
Because an individual's attributes are shaped by their class position.
Therefore, by understanding these individuals
We can then understand class privilege.
The question that many sociologists have spent their entire lives studying
It's about how class advantages are passed down to the next generation.
Among the most famous theories
It is the "cultural capital theory" of French sociologist Bourdieu.
Bourdieu discovered that both middle-class and upper-class parents utilize various resources.
So that the next generation can be influenced by and replicate class characteristics.
Like what food they like to eat, what music they like to listen to, what books they like to read.
What movies do you enjoy?
And often travel abroad
These tastes and values ​​are cultivated from childhood.
After the child starts school
You'll find that what schools teach aligns with the values ​​of these middle-class families.
Like the essay exam in Chinese class
You need to show off your eloquence and quote extensively.
Geography lessons cover various countries
Middle-class children have probably already gone on trips.
There are also middle-class children who may grow up in bilingual families from a young age.
So English classes are not a problem for them.
Sociologist Annette Lareau calls this process "unequal childhood".
That is, starting from childhood
Families from different social classes already create different starting points for their children.
The starting line is not equal.
This family advantage wasn't something you earned through your own efforts.
It's simply because you were lucky and were born into a privileged class.
Therefore, it conforms to our definition of the privileged class.
However, there is actually a problem here that is often overlooked.
Why do schools teach...?
Is it possible that they all follow the same educational model as middle-class families from a young age?
If schools today changed their exams to test things that the working class is more familiar with...
Then the privileges of the upper and middle classes disappeared.
Instead, the working class has an advantage.
Bourdieu offered a surprising answer:
Because schools are essentially places where collusion with the privileged class is prevalent.
It is used to consolidate the privileges of the upper and middle classes, which can be passed down to the next generation.
Instead of helping underprivileged students to promote social mobility
In this way, the existence of schools perpetuates inequality.
But at the same time, it creates an illusion for young people.
You can improve through hard work and by taking fair exams.
Come and get into the school you want.
Therefore, many people say that being able to get into Jianzhong High School or National Taiwan University is a good thing.
Because they enjoyed various privileges from a young age
This statement itself is consistent with sociological evidence.
But the point of contention today is actually...
Even though I was born into a wealthy family
I tried my best too!
How can you say I have special privileges?
Your family is wealthy, then
Can be sent abroad to study
Your parents can now enjoy their retirement; they are very fortunate.
Then I can be free and unrestrained every day.
How can you now be so denigrating of all my efforts?
My family of origin is like this. Am I wrong?
I did not mean that
That's not what you meant?
I was born into a relatively well-off family.
Am I wrong for being well-mannered?
Is it my parents' fault?
Even if I work two or three times harder
Exceeding others' efforts
Others may not agree with me
This is a misunderstanding of sociological terminology.
Pointing out class privileges does not negate your personal efforts.
The real debate on privilege is about
Many people explain their success "solely" through personal effort.
They cannot see the class privileges they enjoy.
This is what makes many working-class people dissatisfied.
Because many people deliberately ignore their own privileges.
Sociologists even have a specific term for this phenomenon.
It's called the deflecting privilege.
A research team led by British sociologist Sam Friedman discovered...
A quarter of the population in the UK is of middle-class birth, approximately 3.5 million people.
They might mistakenly identify themselves as being born into the working class.
They were clearly born with a class advantage.
However, when recounting her life experiences
They often mistakenly believe they were born into the lower-middle class.
We are a very working-class family.
Be honest.
I am very honest.
What car did your dad drive you to school?
Where's my dad...? So my dad...
To be direct, no, that's one answer.
What kind of car is it?
I can't give a simple answer because...
What car did your dad drive to school?
Not necessarily. It depends.
No, no, no, no, no.
Okay.
In the 1980s, my dad owned a Rolls Royce.
Thank you.
...?
This is actually an unintentional cover-up and avoidance of one's own class privileges.
To create an inspirational story of upward social mobility.
He claimed to have started from scratch.
Tell everyone
I am able to stand in this position today
It's because I worked hard enough
If one's personal achievements are largely due to the inherent advantages of their social class...
How do you explain that?
Why do many people from the lower and middle classes...
He worked incredibly hard to get into the top university
Their chances of finding a good job after graduation
Still lower than the privileged class?
Why are they both graduates of National Taiwan University?
Middle-class students
Are they still more likely to obtain middle-class jobs than working-class students?
To explain this, we cannot look at individual attributes alone.
Sociologists also have a second way of understanding class.
Exclusive Opportunity Hoarding
Sociologist Charles Tilly believes
Inequality continues to widen because of mechanisms that allow exclusive opportunities.
The availability of various lucrative vacancies in society is limited.
Everyone wants to get into a prestigious university and a good company.
However, space is limited.
Therefore, those who control these resources, when screening applicants...
It won't allow everyone to get a share equally.
They tend to keep resources in the hands of their own people.
This exclusion mechanism is called social closure.
For example, in the application process of top American universities
There is a mechanism called legacy preferences.
If your parents are alumni, you will have a better chance of being admitted.
This excludes students from poor families.
Because none of their parents had attended prestigious schools.
This makes it even harder for them to squeeze in.
This kind of exclusive opportunity is a form of class privilege.
In this respect, Taiwan's education system is actually much better than that of the United States.
Since the Ministry of Education implemented diversified enrollment
The phenomenon of exclusive access to opportunities has significantly decreased.
For example, Professor Luo Mingqing of National Taiwan University's research, "Who are the Students of National Taiwan University?"
It was discovered that National Taiwan University had implemented a system of admitting multiple students before
More than 50% of the students at National Taiwan University come from Taipei City and County.
People born in Taipei have more advantages in getting into National Taiwan University.
However, after the implementation of diversified enrollment
The proportion of students from Taipei at National Taiwan University has gradually decreased to below 50%.
in other words
Diverse admission methods can actually reduce the privileged class's exclusive access to opportunities.
It's fairer than the joint entrance exam.
The mechanism of exclusive opportunities also frequently appears in the workplace.
Because of the limited number of vacancies, employers will raise the bar.
Only qualified people are allowed in.
For example, there are requirements for achieving a certain TOEIC or TOEFL score.
How many licenses and permits are required?
Or you need a master's degree to apply.
This way, a large number of people can be eliminated at once.
Because those who can afford higher education and pass these exams are mostly middle-class students.
This exclusion mechanism allows employers to be more efficient in screening candidates.
But actually, it was also intentional or unintentional
This allows middle-class children to maintain their class privileges.
Allowing class to be replicated in the next generation
Hearing this, some people might think
strangeness
I was able to get a job because I was capable enough.
A boss can't possibly hire an incompetent employee who will only lose money, right?
Thinking this way means looking at things only from the perspective of "individual attributes".
However, it was not considered that if only strength is considered...
In fact, many people possess the skills required for the job.
But why do employers ultimately prefer middle-class employees?
Instead of working class candidates
This must be explained from the perspective of class exclusion.
To understand this, we can think about it from the perspective of the nation-state.
A country will always prioritize protecting the jobs of its own people.
Establish various thresholds to prevent excessive influx of foreign workers.
For example, applying for a work visa requires queuing and drawing lots.
This is a mechanism of social isolation.
Give opportunities to your own people first
Imagine if American companies simply opened their borders.
Let all qualified people in the world come to find a job
Tens of millions of people worldwide would want to work for American companies.
Their application system was already overwhelmed.
The concept of this exclusive opportunity leads to a very interesting conclusion.
Since the position of the privileged class is established by constantly excluding others.
So why are the upper classes able to maintain their privileges?
It is precisely because they excluded the working class
In other words, the rich are rich precisely because the poor are poor.
The existence of these two classes is mutually reinforcing and mutually restraining.
This might sound counterintuitive.
I am rich because I earned it through hard work.
Why do you make it sound like I'm oppressing the poor?
The point here is not how hard you work to make money.
Rather, you participated in this exclusive opportunity exclusion mechanism.
If we cancel this mechanism
The privileges that the wealthy originally enjoyed may be damaged.
For example, the American Civil Rights Movement is one such case.
Before the 1960s, many jobs in the United States were open to only white people.
People of color were excluded
So even if you are a Black person with equal ability, you still can't compete with a white person.
But after the Civil Rights Movement
Companies are no longer able to discriminate against ethnic minorities
White people must compete with people of color.
The white privileges that white people originally enjoyed disappeared.
However, this theory of exclusive opportunities
Only by explaining why you couldn't secure a certain position can you truly succeed.
However, it failed to explain a more cruel fact.
No matter what lucrative position or high-ranking post you manage to secure
Class exploitation still exists in the workplace
Even if you get into Jianzhong High School or National Taiwan University, and enter a well-known large enterprise after graduation...
You will still be exploited by the company's capitalists.
Therefore, sociologists also have a third perspective on class.
Viewing classes as a structure of exploitation and domination
Because capitalists possess capital, they control the means of production.
The job duties of the workers can be determined.
Decide how to allocate the company's profits
Because we live in a capitalist society, we've become accustomed to it.
I wouldn't consider this a privilege.
But this is actually a very clear form of power control.
The defining characteristic of capitalism is that the power of domination and exploitation rests with the capitalist class.
How do we define exploitation?
The author proposes three principles.
The first is: the principle of reverse dependence on well-being.
That is, a class is at a disadvantage
It is precisely because another class holds the advantage
The reason why the working class cannot earn money
It is precisely because this money has been exploited by the capitalist class
The second is the principle of exclusion.
Exploiters are able to exploit
It's because the exploited were excluded.
Unable to obtain certain resources
It's like having no say in the company.
Unable to decide how to allocate the surplus
Third is the principle of possession.
Exploiters can appropriate the fruits of the labor of the exploited.
That is what we often call
Exploiting the fruits of labor
When these three conditions are met
Only then can we say that exploitation exists.
Otherwise it wouldn't be called exploitation.
For example, European colonization of North America
Only the first two conditions were met.
However, there is no third item.
Because most of the Native Americans were massacred.
The oppression of indigenous people is not for the purpose of exploiting them.
It's not about turning them into laborers.
Exploiting the fruits of their labor
Instead, they should be driven out of their homes.
Encroaching on their land
Therefore, this process cannot be called exploitation.
It should be called genocide.
But laborers under capitalism are different.
Capitalists will not exterminate workers.
Instead, the goal should be to ensure the survival of the laborers.
Only then can one work for capitalists and be a good employee.
This process is exploitation
Exploitation is very different from the exclusive right to opportunity I just mentioned.
Exclusive opportunity is a position occupied by people of a certain class.
Another group of people were excluded.
Preventing you from working at a certain company
Not letting you enjoy a good opportunity
But exploitation is exactly the opposite.
They want you to get into a company first.
Only then can the capitalist class exploit the working class.
The reason why exploiters can become rich
It is precisely because of the reliance on the labor of the exploited
The exploited may realize that they have been exploited.
It is possible to resist
Therefore, exploitation is actually a dialectical relationship.
From the perspective of exploitation
To break down class privileges
It's not as simple as just improving the education system.
Instead, we must fight with capitalists for the rights that the working class deserves.
After introducing three perspectives on class privilege...
Now let's flip it over.
You might think that families in privileged classes are very happy.
However, this year's sociological research has found...
privileged middle-class families
It was actually full of anxiety
The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes.
The middle class today is struggling to survive.
America's middle class is being hollowed out.
Korean sociologist Kwak Hae-geun pointed out in his book "Privilege and Anxiety"
Over the past 30 years, due to capitalist globalization
East Asian countries have become wealthier
But it has also become more unequal.
The widening wealth gap has led to the disappearance of the middle class.
This is especially serious in South Korea.
Most people's income deteriorated
Only a few people become winners.
Able to maintain middle-class status
This is seen as a privilege by those at the bottom of society.
But from the perspective of the middle class
It is actually an arena for competition for status.
Every middle-class family needs to use various comparisons to highlight their status.
Such as sending one's children to American schools or providing bilingual education.
There are also those who deliberately move to middle-class communities.
To build a middle-class social network
Although living in a luxury villa area is a privilege
But these people are actually living very tiring and anxious lives.
Because they need to consolidate their privileged position
We must constantly compete for status.
Only then can one ensure that their children can replicate their social class.
Sociologist Lan Peijia also observed
Many middle-class parents in Taiwan
In the process of raising children
There is also collective anxiety and unease.
You will find that the middle class
No matter which country
They are all actually very anxious.
On parenting and the future of the next generation
These middle-class families are striving to improve their children's upbringing.
It is actually a class-based "security strategy"
During the raising process
We need to find ways to accumulate various kinds of capital for our children.
Such as learning a foreign language, studying abroad
To consolidate existing class advantages and privileges
It's like an arms race.
Having a child is actually like an investment.
If our children do well in school, then our investment as parents has been successful.
However, these parents often worry
Did I do something wrong?
Pushing children too hard
Lan Peijia believes
This is because the Taiwanese society's habit of "focusing on economic development" has influenced the middle class to also "focus on education and manners."
Because Taiwan underwent rapid industrialization in the 30 years following the war.
Quickly catch up with the Western economic model
Children in Taiwan also need to become useful members of society in a short period of time.
So you think being born into the middle class means you enjoy privileges?
It seems like they've lived a happy life.
However, sociological research has revealed...
The parents and children in these families are actually working very hard.
Outsiders only see their glamorous side.
Can't we see that they are trying to consolidate their privileges and advantages?
There is a lot of internal competition, anxiety, and a sense of superiority in upbringing.
At this point in the discussion, some people might say
Even if there really are class privileges, so what?
This society is inherently unfair.
This argument ignores a crucial premise.
The reason why modern people care about the issue of privilege
It's because modern society promises equality for all.
Everyone's achievements depend on their past efforts.
So whatever position you achieve, you deserve it.
This is what is known as "meritocracy".
One of the biggest differences between modern society and ancient feudal society
Ancient laws protected hereditary noble families.
The etymology of the word "privilege" is "private law".
It refers to the privileged class in ancient Rome.
It has its own set of unique exception laws.
Privileged individuals could receive special treatment from the emperor.
However, modern capitalist society promises everyone...
You can make a name for yourself through fair market competition and your own hard work.
This is because of the existence of the concept that the masses can move up in social classes.
People only criticize those who have privileges.
However, the focus of the privilege debate is not on blaming individuals.
It's not about criticizing the wealthy middle class for being privileged.
This turns it into a fight between the working class and the middle class.
The key point should be to identify the class structure.
To improve class inequality and narrow the gap between the rich and the poor
Turn more workers into the middle class
The feeling of relative deprivation, that others have more privileges, will naturally decrease.
But how do we do it?
The author proposes a model of "class compromise".
It is about uniting the working class.
Use various strategies and actions to persuade the capitalist class to make concessions.
Share more of the fruits of labor with the workers
In the early 1990s, employee salaries accounted for half of GDP.
Corporate profits account for 30%
However, in 2021, the number of employees had dwindled to a record low of 43%.
Corporate profits reached 37%.
The following year, the situation reversed slightly.
However, employee compensation still accounts for less than 44%.
All of these indicate that salaried workers are receiving less and less of the economic benefits.
The relationship between "the interests of the capitalist class" and "the power of the working class" looks like this:
The more disunited the working class
Like an atom, lacking organization
Capitalists will be unhindered
The easier it is for them to realize their interests.
For example, American capitalists have long suppressed labor unions to maintain their interests.
The United States is on the left side of this curve.
But the working class unites
Capitalists sometimes benefit as well.
Like the welfare state system in Northern Europe
Promoting social democracy
It's about enabling capitalists and workers to create a win-win situation.
Therefore, the Nordic countries are on the right side of this curve.
However, most capitalists are unwilling to accept the Nordic model.
Because if society is allowed to move towards the right side of the curve...
The power of the working class continues to increase.
This would pose a risk to capitalism.
However, we can also see from this model that...
If workers' rights continue to expand
The interests of the working class actually begin to decline after reaching a peak.
Why?
Because capitalists might withdraw their investment out of fear.
Relocate factories to other countries
Ultimately, this will only lead to unemployment among domestic workers.
Disadvantageous to the working class
To get society to the right side of the curve
The author provides us with three strategies.
The first is to establish locally rooted workers' cooperatives.
For example, the Spanish Mondragon cooperative, which we introduced before.
It is a large-scale success story.
Can during an economic crisis
Maintaining economic security through labor mutual assistance
The second strategy is the Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP).
Allowing employees to hold company stock through retirement plans
It's like making employees shareholders.
Have a voice on the board of directors
Bringing participatory democracy into enterprises
There are currently 6,500 companies in the United States.
Employee Stock Ownership Plan in Progress
The third strategy is to unite finance.
Private equity investment
Invest in local small and medium-sized enterprises
For example, the 1980s
Quebec's Solidarity Fund (Fonds de solidarité FTQ) is a success story.
To revitalize the local economy
Increase local employment opportunities
To break down class privileges
We cannot simply stop at blaming certain people for being privileged.
It is necessary to reduce class inequality brought about by capitalism.
Many Western countries after World War II
The reason why a prosperous middle class can be created
It's because of class compromise
Make capitalists willing to share more of the economic benefits with workers.
It can be said that everyone is middle class.
An era in which everyone enjoys privileges
Only when the labor force of the whole society is more united
Only then can we truly break down class privileges.
