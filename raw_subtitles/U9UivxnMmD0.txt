Prime Minister Mark Carney and
Alberta Premier Danielle Smith
were all smiles as they signed
a new energy agreement
late last month.
The deal involves a new bitumen
pipeline to the BC coast,
but not everyone is happy.
The plan is facing questions
and criticism from
British Columbia, First Nations,
environmentalists and more.
I asked Stephanie Levitz,
senior reporter for the Globe
and Mail's Ottawa bureau,
about who stands to gain,
who stands to lose,
and what it will actually take
to get this thing built.
Stephanie, great to have you.
How are you doing?
>> My pleasure.
I'm glad to be here.
>> I want you to help us break
down this memorandum of
understanding for us.
What was actually agreed to?
>> So the memorandum of
understanding, you can almost
take it in two parts.
You can look at it and say,
you know, the biggest part,
the headline narrative was
this idea a commitment
by both sides that
there will be a new bitumen
pipeline that runs from Alberta
to somewhere on British
Columbia's north coast.
And in concert with that,
the billing was, you know,
this pipeline
and the potential economic,
sorry, the deal in providing
for a pipeline also sought to
address the obvious
environmental concerns around a
pipeline and the production of
more oil, the the sending and
shipping of more oil.
And so in tandem,
the province of Alberta
also agreed to a more stringent
industrial carbon pricing
program.
And both sides said
they're going to find a way to
build what they're building.
Is the largest carbon capture
and storage program in the
world, which would be in
northern Alberta.
So that's the headline.
There's a secondary piece of
this MOU, which isn't getting
as much attention, and probably
because it's less politically
complicated or, you know,
dynamic.
And it's about computing centres
for AI.
It's about more electricity.
They're called interties
between various provinces
and sort of other things
that both Ottawa and Alberta
have agreed to work on
together.
But really, the big headline
grabber, the thing that's
causing all sorts of
political consternation,
is this notion of a pipeline.
And what goes into that?
>> Well, obviously get to
the pipeline.
But I want to you to help
our viewers understand
this deal.
Can you put it in context of
the sort of larger relationship
between the province of
Alberta and the federal
government in Ottawa?
>> Sure.
I mean, you know, when
Justin Trudeau became prime
minister, Liberal prime
minister in 2015, and he came
in to office with a very direct
commitment that he was going to
do more to combat climate
change.
And one of the ways the
Trudeau Liberal government
chose to do that over the years
was enacting a series of laws
to do everything, for example,
to legislate a restriction on
oil tanker traffic off the
coast of British Columbia,
putting in place measures like
a consumer carbon price, which
we all recall, an industrial
carbon pricing program,
regulations on electricity,
regulations on oil and gas
emissions.
And these were all measures
really designed to drive down
Canada's emissions,
protect its environment
in other ways.
In the case of the
oil tanker ban, with a long
term goal of getting to net
zero carbon emissions by 2050,
enter Alberta.
Enter the election of
Danielle Smith, who you know,
not unlike her predecessor
Rachel Notley.
But Alberta Premier
Danielle Smith really believed
and argued and won government
on the idea that everything
the Trudeau Liberal government
was doing was strangling
the Alberta economy to death,
that it was irresponsible,
in some cases flat out
unconstitutional for
the government to step in like
it was stepping in, because,
you know, one of the biggest
sources of carbon emissions in
this country is the Alberta oil
and gas industry.
And when you're regulating it,
when you're increasing
the pricing,
when you're doing all of these
things, the industry recoils,
the industry contracts.
It may be it doesn't want to
invest as much, it doesn't
want to do other things.
And so that has a choking effect
on the Alberta economy.
So that's sort of the
stage where things were it was
a lot of combat, like, you know,
arm to arm combat between
Alberta and Ottawa for years.
Then enter Mark Carney.
And Mr. Carney took over
from Justin Trudeau,
you know, in January.
Sorry, Mr. Carney took over
from Justin Trudeau earlier
this year.
He promised a new approach
to all sorts of things.
And one of them was, you know,
rebuilding relationships with
Alberta by trying to find a way
to support more development in
the oil and gas industry, while
at the same time meeting
Canada's climate goals.
And, I mean, never have we
probably seen in recent history
such a 180 in political tone
between two leaders,
I mean, every every
provincial leader in this
country, frankly, was was
just smitten with Mr. Carney
and his new approach to
doing things,
but none more so than Daniel
Smith, who if we take, you know,
from their first meeting all
the way until when this
memorandum of understanding was
signed a week ago, you know,
they're basically besties at
this point, a role that, you
know, Ontario Premier Doug Ford
always used to say that
Chrystia Freeland, the former
finance minister, deputy prime
minister, was his best friend,
was his therapist.
And now it feels like there's
some kind of romance going on
between Alberta Premier
Daniel Smith
and Prime Minister Mark Carney
because he has agreed.
Bottom line, to get rid of,
lift, suspend, temporarily
adjust many of the regulations
that she said were poisonous
to her province's economy and
therefore the national economy.
>> I want to actually talk
about another relationship,
the Assembly of First Nations
Chiefs.
They had adopted a resolution
on Wednesday to withdraw
the MOU.
What is required of this
government in terms of
Indigenous consultation
going forward?
>> You know, it's tricky.
You know, in the justice system
and other places, you know,
we often use the expression
three strikes and you're out.
Right.
And I wonder with the Liberal
government right now whether
they've not hit two strikes,
which is to say the Building
Canada Act, which was the thing
that the legislatively lays the
groundwork for something like
this major Alberta pipeline was
rushed through over the
objections of many indigenous
communities who felt there was
an adequate consultation, that
it came, it was sprung on them
out of nowhere.
Fast forward to this memorandum
of understanding,
which, although in the text,
requires consultation
and a degree of buy in
from the Province of
British Columbia,
from the Coastal First Nations
or any other First Nations
or indigenous communities whose
territories might be affected
by this project, it is baked
into the MOU, but they weren't
brought along in a in a
substantive way when this MOU
was being negotiated.
And so I guess it's by
happenstance that
the Assembly of First Nations
is having, you know,
a big meeting this week.
This is very much on
their agenda.
And, you know, whereas the MOU
does not--
I'm trying to to come up with
the language.
The MOU doesn't lay out a okay
in order to get, you know,
the consent and approval of
coastal First Nations
or other First Nations.
We are going to do X, Y, Z
and we're going to do it
over this amount of time.
It just says, yes, this will
be done in respect of
Indigenous rights.
Yes, there will be consultation
and collaboration with
First Nations.
It's worth noting that
this new pipeline is also
allegedly going to be co-owned
by indigenous communities.
I don't know who or when
or how that's going to work.
So there's elements of it
built in.
The problem is, is, you know,
the horse had already left the
barn, to borrow yet another
metaphor.
And many First Nations are
saying, you can't tell us
how you're going to consult us
later, like we should have been
at the table to draw this up
in the first place.
>> Another headline, of course,
is that Prime Minister Mark
Carney lost a cabinet minister
over this.
Help us understand
what else do we know is
happening behind closed doors
in the caucus right now with
with the Liberal Party?
>> It's interesting, you know,
when Mr. Carney came in
and his reputation and that of
some of the folks he brought
with him, namely and relevant
in this instance is
Natural Resources Minister
Tim Hodgson, was that
they were pragmatic businessmen
who just wanted to get deals
done, juice the economy,
get things moving faster.
There was a lot of support
from that,
from the business sector, from
even from within the Liberal
owned the liberals own caucus
and begrudgingly, I think, even
from amongst certain opposition
parties.
Fast forward to now,
and we see a situation where
there is a tension and a clash
brewing within the Liberal
caucus between the get it done,
get it done fast attitude at
the top.
Mr. Carney, Mr. Hodgson
to two different parts of the
Liberal caucus, one wondering
why they're not being brought
along for the ride.
And you have a bunch of
Liberal members of Parliament,
you know, elected in
British Columbia as a,
for example, in the last
election, who are read into
this MOU quite late and in a
matter in a manner rather that
many of them say was dismissive,
rude, arrogant, that they
weren't being treated very
nicely by the centre or by
Mr. Hodgson.
Then you have the
environmentalists within this
caucus, a significant enough
portion of them who've now
banded together to create their
own environmental caucus,
something they started at the
outset of this Parliament over
concerns that Mr. Kearney's
commitment to previous Liberal
ambition on climate change
wasn't there.
And, you know, as witnessed
by the fact on on day one,
he signs away and removes
the consumer price on carbon,
which many people say, you know,
was going to be a very
effective means of bringing
down emissions.
Unfortunately, it ran
headlong into an inflationary
crisis and cost of
living pressures.
But the point is,
is that within the Liberal
caucus right now, I do think
there are a significant number
of people for whom Steve Steven
Guilbeault is is now the the
personification of that,
looking at their record,
looking at what's been done so
far and wondering, are we
really committed to climate
change, combating climate
change, and what are we going
to do about that?
Because it doesn't feel like
we're doing very much.
>> We have about 30 seconds
left.
I have one last question
for you.
So far we have just the
framework.
And Prime Minister Mark Carney
has said that the private sector
will need to be involved for
this project and pipeline
to go forward.
That's one of the things
that he says.
But help us understand what
would it actually take to get
this built?
>> I guess the very first
and important.
>> Thing is that someone's got
to be willing to build it.
And right now,
while the Alberta government
is absolutely a champion of
this pipeline, there is no
formal what is known now.
The word everyone is
using is proponent.
There is not a company
coming forward and saying,
I propose a pipeline.
Here's how it's going
to be built.
Here is where it is
going to go.
Here is where
it is going to, you know,
the bitumen in it.
It will exit here.
It can be shipped there.
That does not exist.
This is a theoretical concept
at the moment.
And so really the next major
step for this major project
will be the Smith government
moving ahead and actually
submitting a proposal
for this pipeline.
And that proposal has to
check a number of boxes,
including and again,
collaboration and a degree of
consent from the government of
British Columbia, and
absolutely, some degree of
support and consent from the
First Nations whose territories
are affected by this.
>> Stephanie, we are definitely
going to continue following
this.
Thank you so much and
thank you for your insights.
>> My pleasure. Anytime.
