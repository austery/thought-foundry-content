It
 drives
 me
 crazy
 that
 nobody
 else


thinks
 about
 risk
 in
 this
 way.
 People


look
 at
 my
 life
 and
 they're
 like,
 "Well,


you're
 crazy.
 You're
 such
 a
 risk
 taker."


Well,
 at least
 I'm
 taking
 the
 risks
 that


I'm
 choosing
 because
 think
 of
 all
 the


people
 that
 like
 go
 out
 partying
 every


weekend
 and
 they
 get
 buzzed
 and
 they


drive
 home.
 And
 even
 sedendary
 people


who
 are
 like, "Well,
 I
 don't
 take
 risk.


I
 stay
 home
 and
 I
 play
 video
 games."
 No,


you're
 at
 a
 much
 higher
 risk
 of
 heart


disease.
 Like,
 they're
 taking
 all
 kinds


of
 risk
 that
 they're
 not
 actually


choosing
 to
 take
 and
 you're
 still
 going


to
 freaking
 die
 either
 way.
 So,
 you


might
 as
 well
 take
 smart,
 calculated


risks
 and
 do
 all
 the
 things
 that
 you


want
 to
 do
 and
 at least
 die
 happy
 when


you
 go.
 He's
 done
 it.
 Alice
 Honold
 has


made
 history
 again,
 scaling
 one
 of
 the


world's
 tallest
 skyscrapers.


>> But
 the
 conclusion
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people


have
 arrived
 at
 is
 that
 you
 don't


experience
 fear
 because
 when
 they
 look


at
 these
 two
 brain
 scans,
 your
 amydala


is
 lighting
 up
 less
 when
 you're
 shown


scary
 images.
 I
 I
 actually
 hate
 all
 the


brain
 stuff
 because
 people
 always
 put
 me


in
 this
 box.
 They're
 like,
 "Well,
 you're


different."
 And
 I'm
 like, "Well,
 not


really.
 Like,
 I'm
 a
 middle
 class


suburban
 kid.
 Nobody
 in
 my
 family
 is


athletic.
 I
 just
 after
 20
 years
 of


climbing
 5
 days
 a
 week
 and
 being
 really


freaking
 scared,
 I
 respond
 differently


than
 an
 average
 person."
 And
 there
 was


tons
 of
 emotional
 turmoil
 throughout
 it.


Periods
 where
 you're
 just
 like
 I'm


trying
 so
 hard
 and
 I'm
 just
 like
 not
 as


good
 as
 I
 want
 to
 be.
 You
 know,
 I
 was


like
 living
 in
 a
 car.
 I
 had
 like
 a


couple
 hundred
 bucks
 a
 month
 for
 10


years.
 Like
 that's
 challenging.
 But
 you


just
 can't
 master
 a
 craft
 overnight.
 I


guess
 that's
 what
 people
 don't
 see.
 And


so
 how
 do
 you
 create
 the
 conditions
 to


out
 persist
 other
 people?
 And
 then
 in


all
 your
 career,
 when
 is
 the
 moment


where
 you
 were
 most
 scared?


>> On
 an
 expedition
 to
 Antarctica.
 I
 kept


hoping
 that
 it's
 going to
 get
 better
 and


it
 just
 kept
 getting
 worse.
 Like
 I
 could


die.


>> Do
 you
 have
 a
 conversation
 with
 your


partner
 before
 you
 go
 and
 do
 something


like
 this?
 because
 she
 wrote
 a
 letter.


>> Oh
 gosh.


>> Obviously,
 this
 is
 your
 worst
 nightmare,


she
 said.
 But
 we
 all
 have
 to
 do
 scary


things
 sometimes,
 Alex.


>> Guys,
 I've
 got
 a
 quick
 favor
 to
 ask
 you.


We're
 approaching
 a
 significant


subscriber
 milestone
 on
 this
 show,
 and


roughly
 69%
 of
 you
 that
 listen
 and
 love


this
 show
 haven't
 yet
 subscribed
 for


whatever
 reason.
 If
 there
 was
 ever
 a


time
 for
 you
 to
 do
 us
 a
 favor,
 if
 we've


ever
 done
 anything
 for
 you,
 given
 you


value
 in
 any
 way,
 it
 is
 simply
 hitting


that
 subscribe
 button.
 and
 it
 means
 so


much
 to
 myself
 but
 also
 to
 my
 team


because
 when
 we
 hit
 these
 milestones
 we


go
 away
 as
 a
 team
 and
 celebrate
 and
 it's


the
 thing
 the
 simple
 free
 easy
 thing
 you


can
 do
 to
 help
 make
 this
 show
 a
 little


bit
 better
 every
 single
 week.
 So
 that's


a
 favor
 I
 would
 ask
 you
 and
 um
 if
 you
 do


hit
 the
 subscribe
 button
 I
 won't
 let
 you


down
 and
 we'll
 continue
 to
 find
 small


ways
 to
 make
 this
 whole
 production


better.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 being
 part


of
 this
 journey.
 Means
 the
 world.
 And
 uh


yeah,
 let's
 do
 this.


Alex
 to
 understand
 you.
 I
 think
 from


everything
 I've
 learned
 about
 you,
 from


the
 research
 I've
 done,
 from
 speaking
 to


your
 wife,
 your
 agent,
 everybody
 I
 could


speak
 to,
 I
 think
 to
 understand
 your


context,
 we
 first
 need
 to
 understand
 the


circumstances
 in
 which
 you
 were
 raised


and
 the
 childhood
 you
 had
 because
 it


seems
 to
 be
 I
 mean
 for
 all
 of
 us
 there's


like
 fingerprints
 left
 on
 us
 that
 define


the
 anomaly
 um
 that
 many
 of
 us
 become


including
 yourself.
 So
 what
 do
 I
 need
 to


know?
 What
 does
 the
 viewer
 need
 to
 know


about
 the
 early
 context?


>> I
 mean,
 how
 deep
 do
 you
 want
 to
 go?
 I


need
 get
 a
 sofa.
 I
 need
 to
 reply.
 Like,


all
 right.
 Uh,
 but
 yeah,
 certainly


there's
 a
 there's
 an
 imprint
 from
 my


parents,
 my
 upbringing.
 I
 mean,
 they
 had


a
 a
 very
 fraught
 relationship.
 They


eventually
 got
 divorced,
 but
 they
 stayed


together
 for
 the
 kids
 and
 it
 was
 a
 whole


like,
 you
 know,
 say
 a
 tense
 home
 life


because
 neither
 of
 them
 really
 liked


each
 other.
 And
 then
 my
 mom
 is
 very


driven,
 very,


you
 know,
 high
 performing.
 And
 then
 my


dad
 was
 hard
 to
 say.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 my


dad
 was
 deeply
 depressed
 basically
 the


whole
 time
 I
 knew
 him
 cuz
 he
 was
 in
 this


relation.
 You
 know,
 it's
 hard
 to
 tell.


He
 wasn't
 living
 his
 best
 life.
 And
 then


sadly
 after
 they
 got
 divorced,
 he
 was
 he


was
 much
 happier,
 but
 then
 he
 died.
 And


so
 then
 never
 really
 got
 to
 see
 uh
 never


really
 got
 to
 see
 him
 blossom
 that
 much.


>> And
 your
 mother's
 high
 performing.
 And


did did
 she
 sort
 of
 implicitly
 demand


that
 of
 you
 in
 any
 way?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 my
 mother
 speaks
 like
 seven


or
 eight
 languages.
 She
 like
 plays
 every


instrument.
 It's
 like
 kind
 of
 crazy.


She's
 very
 artistically
 minded
 in
 that


way,
 like
 you
 know,
 the
 arts
 and


classical
 sense.
 But
 um
 yeah,
 she
 I
 mean


she
 wanted
 us
 to
 do
 all
 those
 things


too.
 I'm
 a
 deep
 disappointment
 in
 that


regard.


>> There
 was
 a
 phrase
 that
 I
 saw
 when
 I
 was


watching
 the
 documentary
 that
 your
 your


mother
 would
 continually
 say
 which
 I


think
 translates
 to
 something
 like
 not


good
 enough
 like
 pressing
 a
 ka
 like


almost
 like
 almost
 doesn't
 count.
 It's


funny
 because
 I
 feel
 like
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 my


adult
 life
 now
 one
 of
 my
 sort
 of
 go-to


sayings
 is
 you
 know
 don't
 let
 perfect
 be


the
 enemy
 of
 good.
 I'm
 really
 into
 like


good
 enough.
 Like
 it's
 better
 to
 like


try.
 It's
 better
 to
 do
 something,
 you


know,
 it's
 better
 to
 fail
 quickly
 and


learn
 and
 keep
 moving
 forward
 than
 to


not
 try
 something.
 Like
 basically,
 I


don't
 want
 to
 be
 crippled
 by


perfectionism.
 Sort
 of
 like
 my
 mom
 is


very
 much
 a
 perfectionist,
 you
 know,


like
 if
 you
 can't
 do
 it
 right,
 don't
 do


it.
 I'm
 sort
 of
 like
 I
 think
 it's
 better


to
 try
 and
 learn
 and
 improve,


>> but
 she's
 accomplished
 a
 lot
 of
 things


with
 that
 approach.


>> Yeah,
 she
 Yeah,
 she
 has
 for
 sure.


>> What
 about
 emotions?
 This
 is
 something


you
 I've
 had
 heard
 you
 sort
 of
 talked


about
 a
 lot
 is
 in
 that
 environment
 where


your
 mother
 and
 father
 aren't
 getting


along
 well.
 I
 think
 I
 I
 heard
 you
 say


that
 your
 you
 hadn't
 seen
 your
 father


really
 happy
 before
 he'd
 passed
 away.


>> Yeah.


>> Was
 it
 an
 emotional
 household
 in
 terms


of
 affection?


>> No,
 it
 was
 a
 very
 unemotional
 household.


That
 said
 though,
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 a


safe,
 relatively
 happy
 household.
 Like


it
 was
 it
 was
 fine,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 I


was
 close
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 extended


family.
 And
 so
 I
 had
 a
 really
 good


relation
 with
 my
 grandparents
 and
 some


my
 aunts
 and
 uncles.
 And
 so
 I
 mean
 I


basically
 would
 have
 characterized
 it
 as


a
 totally
 happy
 family
 life
 until
 I


became
 older
 and
 started
 seeing
 other


people's
 families
 more
 and
 was
 kind
 of


like,
 "Oh,
 this
 seems
 even
 happier."
 You


know what
 I
 mean?
 It's
 like
 basically


really
 good
 until
 you
 see
 what
 what
 else


it
 can
 be
 and
 then
 you're
 like
 this


seems
 even
 better.


>> And
 your
 mom
 wasn't
 ever
 affectionate.


>> You
 know,
 it
 always
 feels
 slightly


conditional,
 you
 know,
 where
 it's
 like


uh
 you
 know,
 she
 cares
 if
 you
 be
 you


know,
 if
 you
 perform
 well,
 like
 if
 you


do
 well,
 like
 if
 you're
 a
 good
 kid
 or


whatever,
 you
 know
 what
 I
 mean?


>> Where
 where
 did
 climbing
 come
 into
 your


life?
 Cuz
 I've
 got
 some
 I
 have
 found


some
 photos
 of
 you
 climbing
 and
 you
 look


your
 like
 with
 your
 sister,
 I
 believe.


Here
 we
 go.
 This
 one
 here.


>> Yeah.
 Classic.
 How
 old
 have
 you
 been?


>> I
 don't know.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't know,
 like


six
 or
 something
 or
 eight.
 It's
 hard
 for


me
 to
 tell
 like
 medium-sized
 kids
 ages.


Why?
 Why
 climbing?


>> Oh,
 why
 not?
 It's
 so
 freaking
 cool.
 Have


you
 Have
 you
 rock
 climbed?


>> I've
 Yeah,
 I
 have.


>> You
 gone
 to
 a
 gym?


>> Yeah,
 I've
 I
 have.
 But


>> And
 wasn't
 it
 the
 freaking
 coolest


thing?


>> It
 was
 fun.
 Yeah,
 for
 sure.
 I
 mean,


saying
 I've
 climbed
 when
 I'm
 sat
 with


you
 is
 I
 feel
 like


>> Yeah.
 But
 you
 have
 tried
 it.


>> Yeah,
 I
 have.
 Yeah.


>> As
 an
 adult,
 if
 you
 can
 imagine
 as
 a
 kid


how
 fun
 that
 is.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 just


keep
 doing
 that
 non-stop
 and
 then
 you


find
 that
 you're,
 you
 know,
 have
 some


aptitude
 for
 it,
 you
 enjoy
 it.
 It's


like,
 you
 know,
 you
 can
 imagine
 going


down
 that
 path.
 It's
 so
 cool.


>> But
 is
 there
 something
 about
 the


challenge
 of
 climbing
 that
 you
 think


just
 kind
 of
 like
 was
 a
 jigsaw
 piece
 for


your
 for
 you
 your
 brain?
 Like
 problem


solving?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 something


elemental
 about
 climbing
 in
 the
 same
 way


as
 like
 running
 or
 swimming.
 It's
 like
 a


basic
 movement
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 is


quite
 enjoyable.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 I
 also


I
 I
 think
 I
 have
 an
 innate
 love
 of
 like


being
 on
 top
 of
 things
 like,
 you
 know,


being
 at
 the
 top.
 Basically,
 I
 love
 big


views.
 I
 like
 the
 expansive,
 you
 know,
 I


like
 air
 and
 so
 I
 like
 being
 up
 on


stuff.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 it
 just


hit
 a
 few
 sweet
 spots
 like
 that
 where
 I


was
 like,
 "Oh,
 climbing
 is
 just
 so


cool."
 And


>> you
 I'm
 assuming
 you
 never
 thought
 this


could
 be
 a
 career.


>> No.
 No.
 And
 actually,
 even
 when
 I


started
 rock
 climbing
 sort
 of
 full-time,


I
 still
 didn't
 think
 it
 could
 be
 a


career
 because
 there
 just
 wasn't
 really


professional
 climbing
 at
 that
 time.
 It


was
 like
 much
 smaller.
 The
 industry
 is


way
 smaller.
 Climbing
 was
 way
 more


fringe
 and
 like
 less
 of
 a
 thing.
 But
 you


weren't
 motivated
 by
 like
 money
 or


anything
 cuz
 one
 does
 not
 pursue
 rock


climbing
 to
 become
 No.
 Rich.


>> Not
 to
 become
 rich.
 No.
 Well,
 so
 I
 said


though,
 so
 my
 father
 died
 like
 the


season
 before
 that.
 And
 because
 my


parents
 had
 just
 gotten
 divorced,
 he


basically
 left
 his
 retirement
 to
 my


sister
 and
 me
 and
 she
 used
 it
 to
 finish


college.
 I
 just
 put
 it
 into
 bonds
 and


was
 living
 off
 like
 300
 bucks
 a
 month
 or


whatever,
 which
 kind
 of
 like
 worked.
 You


know,
 I
 was
 like
 living
 in
 a
 car.
 I


stole
 my
 mom's
 minivan
 at
 the
 time.
 I


had
 like
 a
 couple
 hundred
 bucks
 a
 month


and
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 enough
 to
 just
 like


go
 to
 be
 a
 19-year-old
 just
 like


camping,
 you
 know.


>> Was
 it
 this
 minivan?


>> No,
 that's
 my
 second
 one.
 That's
 the


Ford
 Econoline.
 That's
 the
 first
 actual


van
 that
 I
 bought.
 I
 lived
 in
 that
 van


for
 10
 years.


>> For
 10
 years?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 I
 bought
 this
 van.
 I


mean,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 classic.
 But
 so,
 I


bought
 this
 van
 for
 10
 grand.
 And
 and


then
 originally,
 this
 is
 the
 last


buildout,
 which
 is
 the
 classiest


buildout.
 The
 original
 one
 my
 uncle
 and


I
 did
 for
 free
 with
 like
 scrap
 wood
 from


his,
 you
 know,
 in
 his
 wood
 shop.


basically.
 And
 uh
 and
 so
 then
 I
 lived
 in


that
 for
 10
 years
 and
 you're
 kind
 of


like,
 yeah,
 when
 you
 live
 in
 it,
 I


couldn't
 even
 stand
 in
 this
 van,
 you


know,
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,
 my
 back."
 But
 you


know,
 when
 you're
 living
 in
 your
 car
 for


10
 years,
 you
 save
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


>> Between
 what
 ages
 did
 you
 live
 in
 your


car
 for
 10
 years?


>> I
 probably
 bought
 this
 van
 when
 I
 was


20.
 So
 20
 to
 30
 basically.


>> H
 does
 the


>> Yeah,
 actually
 I
 think
 that's
 right


because
 um
 because
 I
 think
 I
 met
 my
 wife


when
 I
 was
 30
 and
 that
 same
 year
 I


switched
 from
 this
 van
 to
 the
 bigger


van.
 And
 if
 you've
 seen
 the
 film
 Free


Solo,
 that's
 um
 I
 bought
 the
 the


ProMaster,
 this
 like
 Dodge.
 It
 was
 like


I
 could
 stand
 up
 in
 my
 van
 finally
 and
 I


was
 like,
 I'm
 moving
 up
 in
 the
 world.
 I


can
 stand


>> in
 there
 really
 well.
 Oh,
 there's
 there


is
 a
 little
 stove
 in
 this
 one,
 but


>> yeah.
 So,
 this
 though
 is
 the
 I
 did
 three


different
 buildouts
 of
 this
 van
 over
 the


10
 years
 cuz
 like
 the
 original
 one
 was


super
 scrappy.
 The
 second
 build
 was
 like


a
 little
 nicer
 and
 then
 this
 was
 like
 a


pretty
 nice
 build
 that
 I
 had
 for
 I
 don't


know,
 five
 or
 six
 years
 or
 something.


When
 you
 live
 in
 your
 van
 for
 10
 years


and
 you
 have
 a
 mother
 who
 is
 very


performance
 focused,
 I've
 got
 um
 her


here.
 I
 believe
 you
 coming
 with
 her.


Classic.


>> Do
 you
 not
 face
 a
 lot
 of
 external


pressure
 to
 like
 go
 get
 a
 real
 job?


Honestly,
 less
 so
 than
 you
 would
 think.


Um


like
 to
 her
 credit,
 my
 mom
 was
 always


pretty
 supportive
 of
 the
 whole
 path.
 I


think,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 lucky


that
 that
 I
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 when
 I
 was


like
 young
 enough
 that
 it's
 all
 part
 of


like
 you're
 gappier
 like,
 you
 know,
 it's


like
 you're
 young
 and
 you're
 finding


yourself
 and
 then
 and
 then
 I
 think
 there


was
 enough
 sort
 of
 external
 validation


that
 that
 my
 family
 could
 at least
 look


at
 and
 be
 like,
 well,
 you
 seem
 to
 be


good
 at
 this
 random
 thing
 even
 though
 we


don't
 get
 it
 and
 don't
 really
 know
 what


you're
 doing,
 but
 at least
 other
 people


think
 you're
 good
 at
 it.
 So,
 keep
 doing


your
 thing.


>> And
 at
 this
 point,
 was
 it
 was
 it
 rock


climbing?
 Was
 it
 free
 soloing?
 And


>> yeah,
 it's
 all
 a
 little
 bit
 of


everything,
 but
 basically
 just
 being
 a
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 like
 being
 a


professional
 climber,
 quote
 unquote.


Some
 of
 it's
 free
 soloing,
 some
 it's


like
 speed
 climbing,
 some
 of it's
 just


hard
 climbing,
 some
 of it's
 going
 on


expeditions,
 doing
 new
 roots,
 like
 it's


a
 little
 bit
 of
 everything.


>> And
 for
 the
 average
 person
 that
 doesn't


know
 what
 free
 soloing
 is,
 what's
 the


like
 definition
 of
 it?


>> That's
 climbing
 without
 a
 robe.
 So


climbing
 without
 protection,
 which
 is


definitely
 what
 I'm
 most
 well
 known
 for


now,
 but
 in
 the
 context
 of
 professional


climbing,
 I've
 done
 tons
 of
 other
 things


in
 climbing.
 Like
 most
 of
 the
 time
 you


have a
 rope
 on,
 most
 of the
 time
 you're


doing
 other
 sorts
 of
 things.
 But
 it's


like
 the
 free
 souling
 is
 what
 you
 might


have
 been
 well
 known
 for
 because
 that


like
 breaks
 into
 the
 mainstream
 a
 lot


more.


>> I'm
 really
 intrigued
 generally
 by
 people


like
 you
 who
 like
 take
 I
 mean
 take
 the


path
 less
 traveled
 in
 their
 career
 and


then
 maybe
 nearer
 the
 the
 end
 of
 the


graph
 pick
 up
 traction.
 And
 I
 have
 this


piece
 of
 paper
 in
 this
 pen
 because
 I'd


love
 if
 you
 could
 from
 the
 age
 of
 let's


say
 80
 you're
 now
 40
 years
 old.


>> Yeah
 I
 turned
 40
 this
 year
 old.
 Could


you
 draw
 a
 graph
 showing
 how
 your
 career


looks
 in
 terms
 of
 success?
 You
 can


measure
 that
 by
 money
 or
 attention
 or


whatever.
 Let's
 see.
 So,


>> it
 was
 kind
 of
 like


>> nothing.


>> Slow
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 then
 like
 thisish.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then
 kind
 of
 like
 and
 then
 basically


just
 like
 in
 like
 this
 where
 you


basically
 like
 kind
 of
 flat
 but
 growing


and
 then
 you
 have
 free
 solo
 where
 it


jumps
 a
 ton.
 It's
 like
 kind
 of
 crazy.


And
 then
 and
 then
 it
 keeps
 kind
 of


growing
 at
 a
 slightly
 faster
 rate
 than


before
 and
 then
 it
 basically
 jumps
 a
 ton


because
 of
 the
 building
 thing
 again.


>> I
 I
 find
 this
 fascinating
 because
 most


people
 in
 their
 lives
 wouldn't
 be


willing
 to
 endure
 this
 phase
 18
 to
 29


where


>> it's
 not
 enduring.
 It's
 so
 great.
 Like
 I


would
 do
 that
 again.
 I
 loved
 it
 so
 much.


Like
 I
 mean
 I
 often
 think
 I'd
 be
 so


happy
 to
 just
 start
 over
 from
 zero


because
 like
 all
 the
 places
 that
 I
 go


climbing
 now
 I've
 been
 climbing
 there


for
 20
 years
 and
 I've
 like
 done
 most
 of


the
 things
 I
 can
 do
 and
 you
 know
 I've


sort
 of
 like
 tapped
 out
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


in
 the
 western
 US
 and
 I'm
 like
 man
 I


would
 love
 to
 just
 hit
 the
 rezero
 button


and
 start
 over
 because
 you'd
 have
 so


much
 stuff
 to
 do
 and
 it's
 so
 amazing.


>> I
 guess
 that's
 the
 that's
 the
 different


the
 fault
 of
 my
 question
 is
 that
 I
 said


the
 word
 endure
 but
 you
 see
 it
 as


>> Yeah.
 You
 get
 to
 climb
 every
 single


thing
 you
 see.
 It's
 amazing.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 and
 that's
 the
 thing


is
 like
 from
 age
 18
 to
 to
 30,
 I


basically
 did
 try
 to
 climb
 every
 single


thing
 I
 could
 see
 because
 I
 was
 just


like,
 I'm
 learning.
 I'm
 growing.
 This
 is


amazing.
 I
 climb
 everything.
 And
 like


now
 I'm
 actually
 much
 more
 strategic


about
 it
 because
 doing
 tons
 of
 easy


climbing
 like
 doesn't
 really
 help
 me
 at


this
 point.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 make
 like


big
 technique
 gains.
 It
 basically
 just


makes
 me
 tired
 without
 without
 the
 right


kind
 of
 gains.
 It'd
 be
 like
 somebody


it'd
 be
 like
 an
 elite
 runner
 just


jogging
 for
 miles
 and
 miles
 every
 day.


And
 you're
 kind
 of
 like
 that's
 not
 going


to
 make
 you
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 improve


your
 marathon
 time
 if
 you're
 already


like
 an
 elite
 runner.
 It's
 it
 might
 be


fun,
 but
 it's
 just
 not
 going
 to
 like


move
 the
 needle
 for
 you.
 Through
 this


period
 of
 your
 life,
 18
 to
 30,
 you're


optimizing
 for
 just
 having
 fun,
 doing


things
 you
 enjoy.


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 no,
 I
 was
 always
 I
 was


always
 challenging
 myself.
 Like


basically,
 I
 was
 optimizing
 for
 like


what's
 the
 next
 thing
 I
 can
 do
 that


pushes
 me
 a
 little
 bit.


>> But
 you
 weren't
 optimizing
 for
 how
 to


get
 rich
 or


>> Well,
 then
 I
 would
 have
 gotten
 a
 job.
 If


I
 was
 optimizing
 for
 getting
 rich,
 I


would
 have
 freaking
 finished
 my
 college


degree
 and
 gotten
 a
 job.


>> I
 say
 this
 in
 part
 because
 I
 interview


so
 many
 people
 who
 pursued
 careers
 that


are
 often
 considered
 not
 real
 jobs,
 like


comedians
 or
 magicians.


>> And
 I
 tend
 to
 find
 the
 same
 thing


between
 the
 age
 of
 18
 and
 30,
 they


optimize
 for
 something
 that
 isn't


necessarily
 being
 rich
 or
 famous.
 And


then
 at
 some
 point
 the
 graph
 looks
 like


this.
 Well,
 it's
 because
 I
 mean
 I
 think


I'm
 sure
 you
 know
 this,
 but
 I
 mean
 the


the
 world
 really
 it's
 like
 a
 winner
 take


all
 economy
 type
 deal.
 It's
 like


basically
 if
 you're
 the
 dude
 that
 does


the
 thing,
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 your
 earnings


go
 insane.


>> But
 until
 you
 become
 the
 dude
 that
 does


the
 thing,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're
 like
 the


best
 magician
 or
 the
 best
 comedian
 or


the
 best
 whatever,
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


you
 make
 an
 insane
 amount
 of
 money.
 But


when
 you're
 just
 like
 one
 of
 many


struggling
 comedians,
 you're,
 you
 know,


you're
 struggling.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 for
 me


as
 a
 climber,
 you're
 sort
 of like,
 oh,


I'm
 just
 a
 dude
 living
 in
 my
 van


climbing.
 But
 then
 a
 certain
 point,
 I'm


like
 the
 dude
 that,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 like,


oh,
 you're
 that
 guy
 that
 climbs
 without


the
 rope.
 And
 you're
 like,
 oh
 yeah,


cool.
 And
 then
 all
 of a
 sudden
 your


earnings
 are
 like


>> Was
 this
 um
 was
 this
 a
 difficult
 period


of
 your
 life
 this
 18
 to
 30?


>> No,
 it
 was
 like
 the
 best.
 Well,


obviously
 it
 was
 like
 f,
 you
 know,
 I
 was


like
 trying
 to
 juggle
 rel
 like
 I
 wanted


to
 get
 a
 girlfriend.
 You're
 a
 young
 20s


man
 living
 alone
 in
 a
 car
 like
 wanting


to
 be
 better
 at
 something
 than
 you
 are


and
 not
 not
 quite
 knowing
 the
 way,
 not


knowing
 what
 you're
 doing
 with
 your


life.
 So
 no,
 so
 obviously
 there
 was
 tons


of
 emotional
 turmoil
 throughout
 it,
 but


no,
 I
 mean
 retrospectively
 it's
 like


amazing.
 And
 your
 your
 dad
 passes
 away


which
 is
 in
 part
 I
 guess
 some
 of
 the


catalyst
 for


>> Yeah.
 Honestly
 my
 dad
 passing
 away


should
 be
 the
 beginning
 of
 that
 graph.


It
 should
 be
 this
 should
 basically
 start


at
 19
 cuz
 uh
 18
 I
 went
 to
 university
 and


so
 then
 uh
 starting
 at
 19
 I
 guess
 I
 uh


went
 on
 the
 road.


>> Your
 dad
 passing


what
 impact
 did
 that
 have
 on
 you
 outside


of
 it
 somewhat
 liberating
 you
 to
 to
 make


decisions
 that
 outside
 of
 his


expectations?


>> Well
 I
 mean
 obviously
 it
 was
 you
 know


it's
 sad.
 It's
 hard
 like
 and
 especially


now
 I'm
 sort
 of
 like
 oh
 it's
 too
 bad


that
 that
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 relationship


with
 my
 dad
 and
 he
 doesn't
 you
 know
 that


my
 kids
 don't
 have
 a
 grandfather
 and
 all


that
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 yeah


it's
 it's
 tough.
 I
 think
 that
 the
 most


immediate
 impact
 that
 had
 maybe
 was
 just


reminding
 me
 of
 my
 own
 mortality,
 you


know,
 I
 mean,
 he
 he
 died
 unexpectedly
 at


55,
 just
 fell
 over
 in
 the
 airport
 and


just
 fell
 over
 dead.
 Um,
 like
 heart


attack.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 I


think
 that
 that
 reminder
 of
 my
 own


mortality
 has
 had
 a
 big
 impact
 on
 my


career,
 my
 life,
 you
 know,
 my
 climbing


world,
 whatever.
 one
 might
 not
 expect


you
 to
 go
 quote
 unquote
 do
 risky
 things


because
 of


>> well
 no
 because
 the
 thing
 is
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 reasons
 that
 people
 don't
 do


risky
 things
 is
 because
 they
 have
 this


uh
 you
 know
 mistaken
 idea
 that
 they
 can


live
 forever
 basically
 and
 basically


because
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 think
 about


their
 own
 mortality
 and
 so
 they're
 like


oh
 I
 don't want
 to
 take
 any
 risks
 I


could
 die
 and
 you're
 like
 you
 know
 that


you're
 going
 to
 die
 either
 way
 and


either
 way
 when
 you
 die
 you're
 going
 to


be
 bummed
 that
 you
 didn't
 live
 longer


because
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 like
 the
 life


expect
 78
 and
 you're
 like
 Say
 you
 make


it
 to
 for
 men,
 whatever.
 Like,
 say
 you


make
 it
 that
 far,
 you're
 still
 going
 to


be
 like,
 man,
 I
 wish
 I
 had
 22
 more
 years


to
 like
 watch
 my
 grandkids
 graduate


college
 or
 whatever,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like


it's
 still
 going
 to
 feel
 like
 too


little.


>> And
 so,
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like,
 you're
 better


off
 dying
 at
 55
 in
 an
 accident,
 but


having
 done
 many
 things
 that
 you're


proud
 of
 and,
 you
 know,
 like
 led
 a
 life


that
 you're
 that
 you're
 proud
 of
 than


dying
 at
 78
 and
 still
 wishing
 you
 had


more,
 but
 having
 done
 none
 of
 the
 things


you
 wanted
 to
 do.
 It


>> is
 interesting.
 It
 does
 appear
 that


people
 live
 as
 if
 we
 think
 we're
 going


to
 live
 forever.
 Yeah,
 it's
 totally


insane.
 I
 mean,
 everyone's
 like,
 "Oh,
 I


don't
 take
 any
 risk."
 And
 you're
 like,


"Yeah,
 well,
 you
 can
 take
 no
 risk
 in


your
 life
 and
 you're
 still
 going
 to


freaking
 die."
 So,
 you
 might
 as
 well


take
 smart,
 calculated
 risks
 and
 do
 all


the
 things
 that
 you
 want
 to
 do
 and
 at


least
 die
 happy
 when
 you
 go.


>> What
 does
 this
 mean
 to
 you
 to
 like
 live


intentionally?


>> Well,
 that's
 exactly
 it.
 Like
 choosing


the
 the
 risk
 that
 you're
 willing
 to


take,
 making
 choices,
 like
 using
 your


time
 the
 way
 you
 want
 to
 use
 it.


>> I
 was
 looking
 at
 I
 think
 it
 was
 your


your
 personality
 a
 personality
 test
 you


did.
 You
 said
 you


>> like
 did
 I
 do
 a
 personality
 test?
 Um


like
 how
 much
 material
 do
 you
 have?
 I'm


like
 Jesus
 Christ.
 Like
 how
 many
 like


things
 do
 you
 have?


>> I
 have
 unlimited
 things.


>> I
 know.
 I'm
 so
 impressed


>> on
 this
 uh
 personality
 test.
 It
 says


you're
 you
 know
 higher
 on
 thrillseeking


and
 sensation
 seeking
 but
 then
 also


significantly
 higher
 than
 the
 average


male
 on
 urgency
 which
 I
 think
 kind
 of


overlays
 with
 what
 you
 were
 just
 saying


there
 of
 like
 making
 the
 decision
 to
 do


something.


>> Yeah.
 Basically
 because
 your
 time
 is


short
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 die
 so
 get
 on


with
 it.


>> It
 says
 here
 you're
 higher
 on


conscientiousness.


>> Very
 polite.
 You
 know,


>> thrill
 seeking,
 sensation
 seeking,


you're
 low
 on
 boredom.


>> I
 think
 low
 on
 boredom
 means
 that,
 you


know,
 you
 don't
 get
 bored.


>> Perseverance.
 You're
 very
 high
 on


perseverance.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 same
 as
 low
 on


boredom.


>> And
 low
 on
 neuroticism.


>> That's
 for
 sure.


>> And
 so,
 what's
 your
 what
 is
 what's
 the


definition
 of
 the
 word
 neuroticism?
 Is


it
 like


>> Well,
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 the
 Well,
 I'm


sure
 there's
 a
 clinical
 definition,
 but


I
 think
 of
 it
 as
 sort
 of
 general
 anxiety


type
 stuff,
 like,
 you
 know,
 people


spinning
 in
 their
 heads
 about
 things


that
 don't
 matter.
 And
 has
 that
 always


been
 the
 case
 when
 you
 look
 back
 through


your
 life
 and
 the
 feedback
 you've
 had
 as


a
 kid
 and
 a
 teenager?
 Kind
 of.
 Yeah.
 I


think
 so.
 I
 think
 I've
 never
 been
 too


concerned
 about
 I
 I
 don't
 spin.
 I
 mean,


obviously,
 you
 know,
 occasionally
 I


stress
 about
 things,
 but
 but
 just
 not


the
 way
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 do.


>> I'm
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 if
 that's
 a


learned
 behavior
 or
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit


learned
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 um
 from
 your


upbringing,
 genetics,
 whatever
 it
 might


be.
 Because
 can can
 one
 learn
 that?
 Can


one
 learn
 to
 be
 less
 neurotic
 and


>> Well,
 presumably
 I
 mean
 like
 meditation,


things
 like
 that.
 I
 think
 people
 can


sort
 of
 find
 a
 way
 to
 let
 go
 of
 certain


things.


>> Isn't
 this
 quite
 quite
 interesting
 when


people
 ask
 you
 questions
 inevitably


about
 fear
 and
 how
 you
 take
 on
 such
 you


know
 to
 muggles
 like
 me
 terrifying


challenges.
 There's
 an
 element
 of
 all
 of


this
 which
 is
 you
 do
 have
 a
 nature
 and


and
 a
 nurture
 which
 somewhat
 is


impossible
 for
 someone
 like
 me
 to


replicate


>> because
 your
 brain
 and
 my
 brain
 are


completely
 different.
 Your
 parents
 your


early
 contacts
 when
 your
 brain
 was
 being


wired
 and
 malated
 are
 completely


different
 to
 mine.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I


always
 find
 this
 is
 the
 like
 the
 trouble


of
 giving
 people
 advice
 is


um
 we're
 dealing
 with
 different


different
 natures,


>> different
 natures.


>> But
 I
 I
 do
 feel
 like
 in
 my
 case,
 the


biggest
 difference
 in
 nature
 is
 the
 fact


that
 I've
 just
 always
 loved
 climbing,


you
 know,
 because
 I
 basically
 I
 think


that
 nurture
 is
 is
 the
 majority
 of
 this.


Like
 if
 you
 spend
 30
 years
 training
 a


thing,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 better
 at
 the


thing.


>> And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 the
 biggest


difference
 between
 me
 and
 and
 somebody


who's
 not
 into
 rock
 climb
 is
 I
 freaking


love
 rock
 climbing.
 I
 could
 go
 I
 could


do
 it
 10
 days
 a
 week
 if
 if
 I
 could,
 you


know what
 I
 mean?
 But
 sadly,
 I
 get
 too


tired
 and
 my
 body
 breaks
 down.
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 I
 could
 I
 basically
 have
 like


a
 limitless
 capacity
 to
 to
 do
 the
 thing.


I
 just
 love
 doing
 the
 thing.
 And
 I
 think


that
 that
 is
 probably
 the
 biggest


difference
 in
 nature,
 you
 know,
 because


everything
 else
 you
 can
 kind
 of


overcome,
 you
 know,
 like
 if
 you
 loved


rock
 climbing
 as
 much
 as
 I
 love
 rock


climbing,
 no
 matter
 what
 your
 your


genetic
 disposition
 towards
 like


neuroticism
 and
 all
 that
 stuff,
 you


would
 just
 kind
 of
 work
 through
 all
 that


stuff
 and
 you'd
 find
 your
 own
 path
 to
 to


getting
 good
 at
 climbing
 basically.


>> If
 your
 kids
 came
 to
 you,
 you
 have
 two


girls,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> If
 they
 came
 to
 you
 and
 said,
 "Dad,
 like


give
 me
 advice
 on
 what
 I
 should
 aim
 at


in
 life."


>> Would
 you
 tell
 I
 wouldn't
 I
 wouldn't


give
 them
 advice.
 I'd
 be
 like, "You
 do


you
 find
 the
 thing
 you
 love
 to
 do,
 go


hard,
 you
 know,
 basically
 like
 learn


some
 skills,
 get
 good
 at
 something,
 like


what
 do
 you
 like
 to
 do?"
 I
 mean,
 that's


kind
 of
 the
 thing
 for
 me,
 especially


with
 climbing
 is
 like
 if
 someone
 had


told
 me
 like,
 "You're
 going
 to
 train


climbing
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 life."
 I'd


be
 like,
 "Oh,
 that
 sounds
 like
 kind
 of
 a


grind,
 you
 know,
 cuz
 I
 mean,
 it
 is
 it
 is


hard
 work.
 You're
 like
 hiking
 uphill


with
 a
 heavy
 backpack
 and
 it's
 cold
 and


it's
 windy.
 It's
 like
 it's
 basically


physically
 uncomfortable."
 I
 mean,
 being


a
 professional
 rock
 climber
 means
 that


you're
 physically
 uncomfortable


all
 the
 time,
 but
 like
 like
 often,
 you


know,
 like
 it's
 you
 know,
 it's
 hard.


>> Yeah.
 But
 if
 you're
 doing
 it
 because
 you


freaking
 love
 doing
 it,
 it
 doesn't
 feel


very
 hard.
 And
 so,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the


key
 for
 a
 kid
 is
 find
 the
 thing
 that


doesn't
 feel
 like
 hard
 work.


>> And
 when
 you
 started,
 were
 you
 scared
 of


of
 big
 tall
 rock
 faces
 and
 stuff
 like


that?


>> I
 mean,
 yeah,
 I
 had
 like
 a
 healthy


intimidation
 of
 I
 mean,
 like
 my
 first


season,
 the
 first
 time
 seeing
 Elcap
 as
 a


climber,
 uh,
 I
 was
 19
 and
 it
 looks


impossible.
 It
 looks
 completely
 insane.


I
 was
 like,
 that's
 so
 big.
 But
 then,
 you


know,
 within
 a
 couple
 seasons,
 uh,
 you


know,
 I
 climbed
 some
 bigger
 walls,


learned
 how
 to
 climb,
 and
 then
 a
 friend


and
 I
 had
 the
 sort
 of
 season
 goal,
 like


we
 were
 going
 to
 climb
 all
 season
 with


the
 aspiration
 at
 the
 end
 to
 climb
 Elcap


in
 a
 day.
 So,
 basically,
 there
 was
 this


long
 progression
 on
 LCAP
 specifically


where
 it's
 like
 you
 go
 from
 just
 trying


to
 get
 up
 it
 to
 trying
 to
 get
 up
 it


faster
 to
 trying
 to
 get
 up
 it
 with
 just


your
 hands
 and
 feet,
 still
 using


protection.
 But
 basically,
 there's
 like


all
 these
 steps
 you
 can
 take.
 And
 so,


over
 a
 bunch
 of
 seasons,
 you
 know,
 I


climbed
 a
 cap
 like
 60
 times,
 different


routes,
 all
 these
 different
 things.
 And


then
 eventually
 you're
 sort
 of
 like,


"Oh,
 maybe
 I
 can
 start
 thinking
 about


freoling
 it."
 Which
 is
 where
 the
 film


Free
 Solo
 comes
 in.
 And
 then
 eventually


you
 do
 this
 thing.
 But
 then
 people
 like,


"Well,
 aren't
 you
 scared?"
 And
 you're


kind
 of
 like, "Wow,
 I've
 spent
 10
 years


like
 building
 up
 on
 this
 thing."


>> I
 guess
 that's
 what
 people
 don't
 see.


>> Yeah.


So
 they
 just


>> I
 mean
 like
 the
 documentary
 Free
 Soul
 I


think
 does
 a
 pretty
 good
 job
 of
 showing


the
 the
 direct
 preparation
 like
 the


training
 involved
 in
 doing
 that
 specific


climb,
 but
 it
 just
 doesn't
 show
 the


uh
 like
 eight
 years
 before
 that
 I
 guess


cuz
 the
 documentary
 was
 filmed
 over
 two


years
 and
 I
 guess
 I've
 been
 going
 since


2006.
 So
 it's
 nine
 years
 before
 that


that
 I've
 been
 going
 to
 use
 and
 I've


been
 spending
 maybe
 three
 months
 a
 year


climbing
 walls.


I
 guess
 that's
 the
 illusion
 of
 like
 all


people
 that
 do
 great
 things
 and
 then


become
 like
 athletes
 or
 sprinters
 or


whatever
 Ronaldo
 or
 Messi
 is
 you
 you


don't
 get
 to
 see
 the


>> Yeah.
 the
 whole
 life
 that
 they
 put
 into


doing
 the
 thing.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 it
 looks
 it
 looks
 like
 a
 magic
 trick


when
 we
 see
 the
 outcome.
 Like
 we
 show


show
 up
 on
 Netflix
 to
 watch
 you
 climb


Taipei
 like
 whoa


>> hanging
 with
 it
 from
 his
 leg.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 people
 watch
 some
 of
 those


programs
 and
 they're
 like
 he
 just
 walked


up
 and
 did
 it.
 And
 you're
 like
 well
 yeah


after
 30
 years
 of
 practice
 like
 I
 just


walked
 up
 and
 did
 it.
 But
 no
 it's
 not


like
 just
 walking
 up
 and
 doing
 it.
 Hm.


>> I
 mean,
 like,
 yeah,
 I've
 literally
 been


climbing
 5
 days
 a
 week
 for
 30
 years.


Like,
 that's
 so
 much
 climbing.
 Like,
 I


freaking
 love
 climbing
 and
 I
 climb
 a


lot.


>> On
 this
 on
 this
 idea
 of
 like
 exposure


therapy
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 like
 fear
 and


anxiety
 and
 confronting
 one's
 uh
 things


that
 terrify
 them.
 Was
 there
 in
 the


early
 days
 were
 you
 I'm
 trying
 to


understand.
 Were
 you
 like
 scared
 at
 some


point?


>> Oh,
 all
 the
 time.
 That's
 actually


something
 that
 I
 think
 uh
 you
 know
 I've


obviously
 done
 so
 many
 interviews
 around


fear
 and
 like
 managing
 fear
 and
 all
 that


and
 I've
 talked
 about
 fear
 a
 lot
 of


different
 ways
 over
 over
 the
 years
 and
 I


think
 as
 I've
 gotten
 older
 I've
 sort
 of


come
 to
 realize
 that
 that
 actually


you're
 just
 scared
 all
 the
 time
 as
 a


climber
 like
 low-level
 fear
 low
 like
 but


you're
 but
 climbing
 is
 fundamentally


scary
 like
 it's
 always
 kind
 of
 scary


because
 there
 always
 consequences
 like


even
 if
 you're
 climbing
 with
 a
 rope


you're
 still
 always
 visualizing
 like


what
 happens
 if
 the
 rope
 breaks
 like


what
 if
 you
 know
 like
 is
 this
 safe
 like


you
 know
 is
 the
 gear
 good
 like
 is
 is


actually
 safe.
 And
 so
 you're
 always
 a


little
 bit
 scared.
 And
 so
 after
 years


and
 years
 of
 always
 being
 scared,
 you


get
 pretty
 good
 at
 managing
 that
 kind
 of


stuff


>> because
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 sort
 of


misconceptions
 swirling
 around
 this


brain
 scan
 you.


>> Yeah.
 I
 know.
 I
 hate
 all
 that
 stuff.


That's
 just
 all
 from
 the
 film
 Free
 Solo.


>> It
 was
 like
 too
 short
 of
 a
 scene
 in
 the


film.
 They
 needed
 a
 little
 more.
 They


need
 to
 let
 it
 breathe,
 you
 know,


explain
 things
 a
 little
 better,
 I
 think.


>> So
 they
 scanned
 a
 control
 subject.


another
 person
 scanned
 you,
 looked
 at


the
 amydala
 in
 your
 brain,
 and
 that
 the


conclusion
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have


arrived
 at
 is
 that
 you
 don't
 experience


fear
 because
 when
 they
 look
 at
 these
 two


brain
 scans,
 your
 amydala
 is
 lighting
 up


less
 when
 you're
 shown
 scary
 images


basically,
 right?
 But
 like
 shown
 just


this
 image,
 like
 what
 does
 that
 even


mean?
 Like
 my
 brain's
 purple
 and
 his


brain
 is
 orange.
 You're
 like,
 like
 what


does
 that
 mean?
 Like
 I
 don't
 know.
 But


no,
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 thing
 is
 though,
 and


this
 is
 what
 I
 wish
 was
 explained
 in
 the


film
 better,
 is
 that
 this
 is
 we're
 being


shown
 black
 and
 white
 photos
 inside
 an


fMRI.
 So,
 you're
 inside
 a
 sealed
 metal


tube.
 You're
 totally
 safe.
 You're


physically
 safe
 and
 comfortable.
 And


you're
 being
 shown
 black
 and
 white


photos.
 And
 so,
 to
 me,
 obviously,
 that's


not
 going
 to
 light
 up
 the
 fear
 response


in
 my
 brain
 because
 you're
 looking
 at


pictures.
 You're
 like,
 who
 cares?
 I'm


totally
 safe.
 But
 in
 a
 control
 subject,


uh,
 you
 know,
 apparently
 your
 brain
 sort


of
 responds
 to
 images
 one
 way
 or


another.
 But
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like,
 I've
 been


climbing
 for
 20
 years,
 so
 I've
 been
 like


scared
 quite
 a
 lot.
 And
 you're
 kind
 of


like,
 well,
 black
 and
 white
 photos
 start


to
 lose
 lose
 their
 edge
 if
 you've
 been


scared
 all
 the
 time
 for
 20
 years.
 So,


it's
 like
 obviously
 that's
 not
 going
 to


trigger
 much.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 imagine
 everybody
 in


their
 life
 can
 think
 of
 a
 scenario
 where


they
 have
 mastery
 that
 would
 sc
 like
 a


stand-up
 comedian
 looking
 out
 at
 a
 stage


probably
 wouldn't
 be
 as
 scared
 as
 me.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 that
 would
 that
 would
 terrify


me.
 Um
 so
 again,
 this
 is
 not
 necessarily


some
 sort
 of
 neurological


>> No,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 real
 takeaway
 is


that
 I
 have
 an
 amydala
 and
 it
 works.


>> Mhm.


>> You
 know
 what
 I
 mean?
 like
 cuz
 I
 think


if
 if
 the
 results
 had
 shown
 that
 I
 was


missing
 my
 amydala
 then
 I
 would
 have
 all


kinds
 of
 I
 would
 have
 died
 already
 at


youth
 cuz
 I
 wouldn't
 be
 able
 to
 function


as
 a
 as
 a
 human
 basically
 but
 you
 know


had
 it
 shown
 something
 like
 that
 where


there
 are
 like
 structural
 differences
 or


like
 some
 real
 change
 but
 this
 is


basically
 just
 showing
 that
 after
 20


years
 of
 conditioning
 I
 respond


differently
 than
 an
 average
 person
 and


you're
 like
 yeah
 no
 kidding
 like
 if
 you


put
 a
 monk
 into
 an
 fMRI
 their
 brain


responds
 totally
 differently
 than


average
 person
 as
 well


>> which
 I
 actually
 think
 is
 a
 really


inspiring
 conclusion
 because
 it
 means


that
 we
 can
 all


>> grasp
 our
 fears
 better.
 And
 even,
 you


know,
 people
 won't
 know
 this
 about
 me,


but
 10
 years
 ago,
 I
 sat
 down
 on
 camera


with
 my
 friend
 Ash
 in
 his
 apartment
 to


record
 a
 two-minute
 video.
 And
 as
 I
 sat


there,
 I
 couldn't
 I
 was
 so
 scared
 I


couldn't
 get
 the
 words
 out.
 So,
 you


actually
 in
 this
 2-minute
 video
 that


comes
 out,
 you
 see
 it
 go
 from
 night
 and


day
 in
 the
 background
 just
 because
 we


did
 that
 many
 cuts
 over
 7
 hours
 to
 try


and
 get
 me
 to
 say
 2
 minutes
 on
 camera.


And
 obviously,
 after
 10
 years
 of
 being


on
 camera,
 I
 can
 now
 speak
 without


[ __ ]
 myself.
 And
 I
 imagine
 my
 brain


state
 looks
 significantly
 different


because
 of
 our
 exposure
 therapy.


>> Totally.
 Yeah.
 Hey,
 you
 should
 do
 the


fMRI.
 You
 should
 Yeah.
 You
 should
 have


done
 10
 years
 ago
 cuz
 then
 you'd
 have


your
 control
 and
 then
 you
 do
 it
 now
 and


it'd
 be
 totally
 different.


>> But
 also,
 the
 psychologists
 I've
 sat


with
 all
 confirm
 this.
 They
 talk
 about


exposure
 therapy.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 went
 through
 exactly
 the


same
 thing
 with
 public
 speaking.
 Like
 I


was
 always
 so
 afraid
 of
 public
 speaking.


I
 was
 also
 very
 shy
 and
 like
 just
 not


like
 it
 was
 terrifying.
 And
 now
 because


of
 the
 free
 solo
 film
 tour
 and
 you
 know


all
 the
 public
 things
 I've
 done
 since


then,
 I'm
 like
 basically
 fine.
 And
 you


know,
 it's
 like
 you
 still
 got
 a
 little


nervous,
 but
 it's
 like
 basically
 easy


now.
 You're
 kind
 of
 like,
 well,
 that's
 a


total
 change.
 It's
 like
 obviously


there's
 a
 tremendous
 capacity
 for
 humans


to
 learn.


>> People
 talk
 to
 you
 about
 fear
 all
 the


time
 because
 I
 mean
 your
 work
 cuz


climate
 is
 really
 freaking
 scary.
 It


makes
 sense.
 It's
 totally


understandable.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 they
 also
 realize,
 I
 think,
 at


some
 deep
 level
 that
 the
 thing
 holding


them
 back
 from
 who
 they
 think
 they
 want


to
 be
 or
 who
 they
 aspire
 to
 be
 is
 fear.


Often
 it's
 judgment
 of
 someone
 else.


It's
 taking
 a
 risk.


>> Totally.
 So,
 you've
 become
 for
 many


people
 the
 like,
 tell
 me,
 tell
 me
 how
 to


overcome.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 think
 that
 everyone's


like,
 "What's
 your
 hack
 to
 overcome


fear?"
 And
 you're
 like,
 "There's
 no


hack.
 You
 just
 get
 really
 freaking


scared
 over
 and
 over
 for
 so
 long
 and


eventually
 it's
 not
 that
 scary
 anymore."


But
 I
 will
 say
 that
 that's
 like
 a
 very


enduring
 way
 to
 overcome
 your
 fear
 is


like
 if
 you're
 willing
 to
 go
 through


that
 process,
 then
 you
 are
 actually


unafraid,
 you
 know,
 because
 like
 you
 can


do
 like
 hacks.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can
 you
 can


like
 crank
 up
 loud
 rock
 music
 and
 just


go
 for
 it,
 you
 know?
 Like,
 and
 there
 are


plenty
 of
 examples
 of
 that
 in
 in
 what


I'd
 call
 gravity
 assisted
 sports.
 Like,


say
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 jump
 a
 cliff
 on


skis,
 like
 you
 can
 get
 to
 the
 edge,
 be


like,
 "This
 is
 really
 scary."
 And
 then


be
 like
 3
 2
 1
 do
 it
 and
 just
 like
 go.
 In


climbing,
 you
 can't
 really
 do
 that
 as


much
 because
 it's
 so
 slow.
 Like
 when
 you


climb,
 you
 make
 one
 move
 and
 then
 you


make
 another
 move
 and
 then
 you're
 like,


"Do
 I
 still
 want
 to
 be
 here?"
 Like
 it


basically
 fear
 creeps
 in
 a
 lot
 more.
 But


sort
 of
 in
 gravity
 assisted
 sports,
 you


can
 have
 more
 of
 that
 moment
 where
 you


just
 like
 overcome
 your
 fear
 and
 then
 it


happens,
 you
 know,
 like
 making
 a
 big


drop
 in
 a
 kayak
 or
 like
 skis
 or
 things


like
 that
 where
 it's
 like
 once
 you


commit,
 it's
 happening
 one
 way
 or


another.


>> Anyway,
 there's
 a
 lot
 to
 get
 into
 with


like


>> No,
 but
 I
 mean
 I
 want
 to
 get
 into
 it.
 I


watched
 a
 video
 of
 you
 climbing
 Half


Dome,
 I
 think
 it
 was,
 and
 it
 looks
 like


you
 got
 scared
 halfway
 up
 or


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 so
 that
 video
 is


actually
 filmed
 later.
 So
 the
 voice
 over


in
 that
 video
 is
 me
 talking
 about
 the


experience
 of
 me
 freestyling
 when
 I
 was


totally
 alone.
 And
 I
 did
 get
 really


scared
 on
 halfdome
 and
 I
 had
 this
 whole


somewhat
 traumatic
 climate
 experience


near
 the
 top
 of
 the
 wall.
 But
 then
 when


we
 went
 back
 to
 film
 it,
 I
 had
 a


different
 traumatic
 experience
 while
 we


were
 filming.
 Less
 traumatic
 but
 uh
 but


like
 very
 scary
 for
 a
 moment
 and
 they


got
 that
 on
 camera.
 So
 they
 basically
 in


the
 film
 they
 just
 cut
 the
 two
 together


as
 like
 a
 because
 it
 shows
 me
 like
 being


really
 scared.


>> What's
 Half
 Dome
 to
 start
 with
 and
 then


what
 was
 the
 traumatic
 experience?


>> Yeah.
 So
 Halfdme
 for
 anyone
 who
 hasn't


seen
 is
 uh
 is
 this
 just
 totally
 amazing


wall
 in
 Euseite.
 It's
 a
 2,000
 foot


granite
 face.
 Actually
 it's
 the
 North


Face
 logo.
 It's
 a
 It's
 freaking
 It's


That's That's
 half
 dome.


>> Okay.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 it's
 like
 an
 iconic
 wall
 in


Euseity.


>> Um
 it
 looks
 like
 half
 of
 a
 dome,
 but


actually
 it's
 more
 like
 a
 hockey
 puck


just
 shoved
 in.
 It's
 actually
 a
 full


dome
 depending
 how
 you
 look
 at
 it.
 But


the
 Northwest
 Faces
 vertical
 for
 2,000


ft
 is
 incredible.
 And
 so
 I
 freelled.


That
 was
 one
 of
 the
 first
 like
 major


free
 soulas
 I
 did
 in
 2008.
 Um
 and
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 sort
 of
 made
 me
 a


professional
 climber
 in
 a
 way.
 But
 when


I
 did
 the
 climb,
 I
 did
 the
 bare
 minimum


preparation.
 I
 basically
 like
 didn't


know.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 the
 biggest
 thing


I'd
 ever
 freed.
 I
 didn't
 quite
 know
 how


to
 like
 go
 about
 getting
 ready
 for
 it.


Anyway,
 I
 I
 climbed
 it
 and
 basically


hadn't
 practiced
 enough.
 Was
 really


freaking
 scared.
 Got
 off
 route,
 got


confused,
 skipped
 some
 stuff,
 and
 then


at
 the
 very
 top
 had
 this
 whole
 moment
 of


extreme
 panic,
 you
 know?
 Basically,
 I


got
 up
 into
 some
 stuff
 and
 all
 sort
 of


like
 crumbled
 mentally
 and
 like
 sort
 of


barely
 managed
 to
 finish
 this
 upper


slab.
 Like
 the
 hardest
 part
 of
 the
 climb


was
 like
 right
 near
 the
 top.
 I
 was


trying
 to
 walk
 across
 this
 ledge.


Basically,
 I've
 walked
 across
 that
 ledge


face
 in
 and
 face
 out.
 you
 normally


people
 hand
 traverse
 it
 or
 they
 crawl


across
 it.
 There
 are like
 different
 ways


to
 go
 across
 the
 ledge
 and
 I've
 done
 it


every
 which
 way
 and
 then
 we
 were
 up


there
 filming
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I'm
 going


to
 walk
 it
 face
 out
 but
 it
 turns
 out


when
 you
 walk
 it
 face
 out
 it's
 really


freaking
 scary.
 And
 so
 I
 made
 it
 kind
 of


halfway
 and
 was
 like
 oh
 my
 gosh
 and
 then


bailed.


>> And
 when
 you
 say
 you
 having
 like
 a
 like


a
 crisis
 in
 your
 your
 mind,
 what
 does


what
 is
 that?
 Is
 that
 just
 oh
 my
 god


what
 am
 I
 like
 how
 does
 that
 sound
 when


you


>> Well,
 I
 mean
 so
 in
 this
 case
 so
 walking


across
 this
 ledge
 it's
 like
 it
 starts


maybe
 as
 a
 foot
 wide.
 So
 your
 foot
 is


fully
 on
 the
 ledge
 and
 you're
 shuffling


across
 it.
 But
 then
 at
 a
 certain
 point,


yeah,
 I
 mean
 that's
 that's


>> the
 video
 I'll
 put
 on
 the
 screen
 for


anyone
 watching.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 that's
 the
 ledge.
 But


basically
 at
 the
 narrowest
 part,
 your


feet
 are
 sticking
 out
 over
 the
 lip
 of
 it


and
 the
 wall
 bulges
 ever
 so
 slightly.
 So


it
 for
 forces
 your
 back
 out
 a
 little
 and


so
 you're
 basically
 like
 rocking
 on
 your


heels
 with
 I
 don't know
 like
 a
 1700T


drop
 or
 something,
 18800t
 drop
 like


straight
 down
 below
 you
 and
 so
 you
 know


it's
 like
 pretty
 it's
 pretty
 intense.


Anyway,
 and
 so
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 going
 to


walk
 across
 it
 like
 that
 and
 I
 made
 it


to
 the
 bulging
 part
 and
 was
 suddenly


like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 this
 isn't
 like
 this


isn't
 for
 me."
 And
 then
 managed
 to
 like


shuffle
 back
 and
 and
 change
 my
 strategy.


>> Is
 it
 like
 panic
 in
 your
 head?


>> It's
 not
 panic,
 but
 you're
 like,
 "Oh,


oh,
 I
 made
 the
 wrong
 choice.
 Like,
 this


is
 bad.
 This
 is
 bad."
 You
 know?
 I
 mean,


it's
 not
 like
 full
 like
 five
 alarm
 bell


like
 panic
 panic,
 but
 yeah,
 you're
 like,


"Oh,
 I'm
 so
 screwed."


>> And
 you
 have
 fallen
 a
 long
 long
 way


before.
 I
 I
 was
 hearing
 about
 a
 time


when
 you
 were
 younger
 you
 fell
 off
 a
 a


mountain
 and
 called
 your
 mother,
 managed


to
 call
 your
 mother
 in


>> Yeah,
 though
 that
 was
 like
 sliding
 down


an
 icy
 cooler
 type
 thing.
 It's
 a
 little


different
 than
 like
 free
 falling
 off
 of


a
 cliff.
 That's
 like
 sliding
 down
 a


mountain.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 got
 totally
 messed


up
 and
 and
 uh
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I've
 like


broken
 my
 arm
 several
 times
 as
 a
 kid


falling
 off
 things
 and
 and
 then
 with
 a


rope
 as
 a
 climber,
 you
 take
 big
 falls


like
 routinely,
 you
 know,
 when
 you
 have


protection.
 That's
 like
 part
 of
 the


sport
 basically.


M
 I
 mean
 it's
 certainly
 easy
 to


visualize
 falling
 700.
 You
 know
 when


you're
 like
 standing
 on
 a
 little
 ledge


and
 you're
 just
 bulging
 and
 you're


looking
 down
 you're,
 you
 know,
 it's
 easy


to
 be
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god."
 You
 know,
 it's


like
 if
 you
 just
 bend
 forward
 a
 little


bit,
 you're
 just
 going to
 take
 a
 swan


dive
 like
 700
 feet
 to
 the
 ground.


>> The
 stats
 in
 this
 sport
 are
 I
 mean
 of
 of


fatalities.
 How
 do
 they
 compare
 to
 other


sports?


>> Uh
 safer
 than
 you
 would
 think.
 That's


the
 thing
 is
 everyone
 thinks
 it
 seems


crazy,
 but
 uh
 it's
 not
 that
 crazy.
 I


don't
 know
 actual
 statistics,
 but
 I


suspect
 that
 it's
 actually
 pretty


comparable
 to
 to
 skiing
 or
 something,


you
 know,
 because
 like
 recreational


skiers
 die
 all
 the
 time,
 like
 falling


into
 tree
 wells
 or
 like
 going
 off
 cliffs


by
 accident
 or
 things
 like
 that.


Climbing
 is
 actually
 surprisingly
 safe,


which
 is
 one
 of the
 things
 I
 love
 about


climbing.
 I
 mean,
 climbing
 is
 very
 it's


very
 uh
 sort
 of
 binary
 where
 it's
 like


either
 you're
 totally
 safe
 or
 you're


going
 to
 die.
 And
 the
 odds
 of
 you
 dying


are
 very
 very
 very
 small.
 But
 because


they're
 they're
 there,
 they
 always
 keep


you
 on.
 You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 Like
 it


basically
 keeps
 you
 alert,


but
 you're
 never
 really
 gonna
 get
 hurt.


>> Is
 that
 including
 free
 soloing?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 for
 the
 most
 part,
 I
 mean,


a
 couple
 people
 have
 died
 free
 soling.
 I


mean,
 people
 occasionally
 die
 free


soloing
 for
 sure,
 but
 actually
 most
 of


the
 the
 sort
 of
 cutting
 edge
 free


soloists
 have
 not
 died
 soling.
 They've


like
 died
 in
 other
 things.
 I
 think
 it


was
 in
 in
 the
 um
 the
 documentary
 on


Netflix
 um
 Free
 Solo
 where
 one
 of
 your


colleagues


>> Yeah.
 Tommy
 Tommy
 is
 like
 most
 free


solos
 are
 dead
 now.
 Um
 which
 is
 kind
 of


true
 but
 it's
 slightly
 mis
 misstated.
 I


mean
 you
 know
 he's
 just
 like
 speaking


off
 the
 cuff
 and
 it's
 not
 like
 strictly


true.
 Like
 a
 couple
 of
 the
 best
 free


solos
 have
 died
 free
 soling
 though
 they


died
 on
 very
 easy
 terrain.
 But
 then
 the


majority
 of
 other
 great
 free
 solas
 have


died
 in
 sort
 of
 climbing
 adjacent


accidents
 like
 wings
 suit
 base
 jumping


and
 uh
 like
 one
 got
 swept
 to
 sea
 by
 a


rogue
 wave
 like
 while
 he
 was
 out


climbing
 a
 sea
 cliff
 but
 he
 was
 like


standing
 on
 shore
 and
 got
 swept
 out
 to


sea.
 You
 know
 things
 like
 that
 where


you're
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 you
 know


obviously
 they're
 taking
 risks
 in
 their


lives
 and
 they
 wind
 up
 dead
 but
 it's
 not


the
 way
 that
 people
 think.
 You
 know,
 you


see
 a
 photo
 like
 that
 and
 you're
 like,


"Free
 soul,
 you're
 going
 to
 die
 for


sure."
 And
 you're
 kind
 of
 like,
 "Well,


people
 don't
 actually
 really
 die
 that


way."
 I
 mean,
 they
 have.
 I
 mean,
 not
 to


say
 that
 it
 doesn't
 happen,
 but
 way
 less


frequently
 than
 people
 would
 suspect.


>> If
 I
 was
 to
 try
 and
 like,
 you
 know,


professionally
 torture
 you,
 and
 again,


I'm
 not
 talking
 in
 extremes
 here,
 but


what
 life
 would
 I
 prescribe
 you
 to
 live?


>> Oh,
 being
 like
 a
 finance
 bro
 or


something.
 Having
 to
 like
 just
 work


spreadsheets
 my
 whole
 life.
 Is
 that
 what


you
 mean?
 Like
 what
 what
 is
 my
 like


worst


>> I
 don't
 know,
 something
 like
 that.
 or


honestly
 being
 like
 a
 choreographer
 for


dance
 or
 something
 like
 I
 just
 I


couldn't
 do
 like
 or
 or
 being
 like
 an


opera
 singer
 like
 I
 would
 just
 kill


myself.
 I
 just
 couldn't
 do
 that.


>> Why
 Why
 would
 being
 a
 finance
 bro
 be


like
 the
 worst
 thing
 for
 Alex?


>> Just
 the
 idea
 of
 sitting
 at
 a
 computer


in
 a
 cubicle
 just
 like
 typing.
 I
 mean


I'm
 kind
 of
 contrarian.
 I
 don't
 like


rules.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 like
 jump
 through


hoops.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 arbitrary


things.
 Like
 I
 don't
 want
 some
 manager


to
 come
 and
 tell
 me
 like,
 "Oh,
 you
 got


to
 file
 that
 report
 again.
 You
 like


missed
 a
 line."
 I'd
 be
 like,
 "You
 go
 f,"


you
 I
 just
 like
 walk
 out
 of
 the
 building


like
 it's
 just
 I
 just
 like
 don't
 know
 if


I
 could
 take
 that
 be
 like
 no.
 But
 that's


like
 how
 most
 of
 the
 world
 live.
 We
 kind


of
 we
 all
 live
 in
 like
 you
 know


>> I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 for
 me.


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean
 doesn't
 that
 just


seem
 I
 mean
 I
 had
 this
 moment
 I've
 been


in
 New
 York
 a
 couple
 days
 and
 I
 I
 took


the
 subway
 down
 to
 see
 some
 see
 some


friends
 and
 I
 was
 like
 coming
 out
 of
 the


tunnel
 and
 it's
 like
 packed
 with
 people


and
 I
 was
 just
 like
 looking
 at
 the


ground
 and
 I
 was
 like
 just
 you
 know


following
 someone
 else's
 footsteps
 up


this
 like
 beat
 down
 path
 of
 stairs
 and
 I


was
 like
 I
 couldn't
 live
 like
 this.
 like


not
 day
 in
 and
 day
 out
 every
 day
 like


this
 is
 just
 like
 feeling
 like
 you're


just
 doing
 the
 exact
 same
 thing
 as


everyone
 else
 around
 you.
 I'm
 like
 oh
 it


seems
 so
 so
 boring.


It's
 funny
 cuz
 so
 so
 many
 of
 us
 look
 at


your
 life
 and
 go
 wow
 that's
 not
 very


normal
 but
 actually
 maybe
 at
 a


foundational
 level
 you're
 living
 a
 much


more
 normal
 life
 than
 I
 mean
 you're
 out


in
 nature
 you're
 moving
 your
 body.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 In
 that
 in
 that
 way
 for
 sure


I'm
 like
 going
 on
 cool
 adventures
 and


going
 out
 and
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think


that's
 also
 part
 of
 why
 the
 the
 sort
 of


attraction
 and
 allur
 with
 your
 life


especially
 when
 you
 watch
 free
 solo
 is


you
 do
 seem
 to
 be
 a
 free
 man


in
 a
 way
 where
 most
 of
 us
 aren't
 free
 as


such.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 well
 I
 think
 we're
 all
 sort


of
 aspiring
 to
 that
 to
 some
 extent.
 I


mean
 most
 people
 see
 that
 though
 as
 like


they
 get
 their
 vacation
 for
 the
 year.


They
 they're
 planning
 to
 retire
 at
 some


point
 and
 then
 they're
 going
 to
 have


their
 freedom
 and
 you're
 kind
 of
 like
 I


don't know.
 I
 mean
 maybe
 you
 got
 to
 try


to
 live
 that
 way
 as
 much
 as
 possible.


>> If
 if
 your
 if
 your
 young
 girls
 came
 up


to
 you
 June
 and
 Alice
 and
 said,
 "Dad,


what's
 what
 is
 a
 meaningful
 life?
 like


what
 are
 the
 principles
 of
 living
 a


fulfilling
 meaningful
 life?
 Would
 you


give
 them
 advice
 there?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it'd
 be
 a
 long


rambling
 multi-day
 conversation
 with


them
 about
 But
 I
 mean,
 following
 your


own
 goals
 is
 is
 I
 think,
 you
 know,


certainly
 one
 of
 the
 the
 cores
 of
 having


a
 meaningful
 life,
 like
 having
 things


that
 you
 find
 valuable.
 I
 mean,
 really


like
 living
 in
 line
 with
 your
 values,


finding
 things
 that
 are
 important
 to
 you


and
 pursuing
 them
 with
 as
 much
 as
 you


can
 give
 them.
 you
 when
 you
 look
 at
 your


early
 so
 20s
 to
 30s
 it
 kind
 of looks


like
 you're
 living
 like
 a
 Buddhist
 a


little
 bit.


>> I
 mean
 yeah
 I
 went
 on
 a
 a
 trip
 once


where
 they
 called
 me
 the
 monk


just
 because
 I
 was
 living
 such
 a
 sort
 of


a
 seated
 lifestyle.
 I
 was
 like
 reading


I've
 never
 I
 don't
 drink
 and
 I
 don't


like
 party
 and
 I
 didn't
 just
 for


personal
 preference
 whatever.
 So
 I'm


just
 like
 living
 in
 my
 little
 van
 and


reading
 books
 and
 climbing
 all
 the
 time


like
 those
 are
 the
 things
 that
 I'm
 into


doing
 you
 know.
 It's
 like
 it's
 yeah
 it's


just
 doing
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do.


Have
 you
 ever
 been
 depressed
 or?


>> Yeah,
 probably
 not
 like
 deep
 clinical


depression,
 but
 there's
 certainly


periods
 from
 time
 to
 time
 where
 you're


just
 like,
 what
 am
 I
 doing
 or
 why
 or


what
 are
 my
 goals?
 Like,
 you
 know,


what's
 And
 I
 think
 to
 me
 the
 most


depressing
 thing
 is
 that,
 you
 know,
 I've


put
 like
 my
 whole
 life
 into
 climbing,


like
 trying
 to
 be
 the
 best
 you
 can
 be


all
 the
 time.
 And
 sometimes
 you
 put
 tons


of
 effort
 in
 and
 you
 just
 don't
 see


results.
 Like
 for
 whatever
 reason,
 you


just
 suck.
 You're
 like,
 I'm
 trying
 so


hard
 and
 I'm
 just
 like
 not
 as
 good
 as
 I


want
 to
 be.
 And
 like
 that's
 challenging,


you
 know?
 But
 that's


I
 mean
 everybody
 faces
 that
 to
 some


extent
 where
 you're
 like
 I'm
 working


hard
 at
 a
 thing
 but
 I'm
 just
 not


achieving
 the
 results
 that
 I
 want.


>> And
 between
 the
 between
 that
 the
 sort
 of


that
 period
 of
 no
 man's
 20
 and
 30
 where


your
 career
 hasn't
 taken
 off
 yet
 the


documentary
 is
 not
 out.
 You've
 not


climbed
 Taipei.
 How
 much
 money
 are
 you


earning
 from
 climbing?


>> I
 mean
 the
 first
 my
 first
 couple
 years


my
 sponsorship
 through
 the
 Northace
 was


like
 uh
 I
 think
 my
 first
 year
 was
 like


10k
 a
 year.
 I
 was
 like
 this
 is
 amazing.


cuz
 I
 was
 living
 in
 my
 car
 and
 uh
 you


know
 making
 10
 grand
 when
 you
 live
 by


yourself
 in
 a
 van
 is
 like
 more
 than
 you


need
 basically.
 Um
 it
 obviously
 went
 up


but
 beyond
 that
 at
 some
 point
 but
 it
 was


you
 know
 like
 in
 the
 10
 to
 100
 range
 for


the
 first
 for
 the
 whole
 yeah
 for
 years.


>> Then
 at
 some
 point
 it
 increases.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 it
 increases.
 I
 mean
 then


free
 solo
 is
 obviously
 like
 a
 big
 thing


and
 that
 sort
 of
 opened
 up
 all
 these


opportunities.
 Uh
 because
 then
 I
 started


doing
 corporate
 speaking
 and
 stuff
 like


that.
 And
 I
 mean,
 as
 I'm
 sure
 you
 know,


that's
 just
 like
 a
 whole
 different


world.
 And
 so
 then
 you
 go
 from
 just
 like


making
 some
 money
 from
 sponsors
 to
 like


making
 money
 from
 from
 other


corporations
 stuff.
 And
 then
 you're


like,
 okay,
 now
 you're
 making
 some


money.


>> One
 of
 the
 things
 when
 I
 was
 I
 was


hearing
 you
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 your


incredible
 climbing
 stories
 is
 um
 I
 was


trying
 to
 understand
 what
 role


visualization
 or
 or
 your
 preparation


plays
 and
 how
 that's
 like
 transferable


to
 to
 me
 and
 my
 life.
 We
 talked
 a
 little


bit
 about
 just
 how
 much
 preparation
 you


did
 for
 something
 like
 LCAP,


>> but
 you
 you
 it
 sounds
 like
 you
 really


break
 down
 the
 challenge
 into
 smaller


bits
 and
 then
 really
 go
 through
 those


individual
 steps,
 whereas
 a
 lot
 of


people
 would
 just
 look
 at
 LCAP
 and
 go,


"Oh
 my
 god,
 they'll
 be
 terrified."


>> And
 then
 say
 impossible.


>> Yeah.
 Which
 is
 fair.
 I
 mean,
 I
 spent


years
 looking
 at
 LCAP
 and
 being
 like,


"That's
 too
 big.
 That's
 impossible."
 And


then,
 you
 know,
 after
 years
 of
 that,
 I


kept
 hoping
 that
 I
 would
 look
 at
 it
 and


it
 would
 like
 look
 easy
 somehow
 and
 I'd


be
 like, "Cool,
 now
 I'm
 going to
 do
 it."


And
 it
 just
 never
 looked
 easy.
 And
 so


then
 finally
 I
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 I'm


gonna
 have
 to
 like
 put
 some
 real
 work


into
 it."
 And
 then
 I
 started
 slowly


breaking
 it
 down
 and
 and
 and
 then
 once


you
 like
 break
 it
 into
 pieces
 and
 start


working
 on
 the
 pieces,
 then
 you're
 kind


of
 like,
 "Okay,
 it
 starts
 to
 feel
 more


reasonable."


>> Break
 it
 into
 pieces
 and
 start
 working


on
 the
 pieces.
 What
 does
 that
 mean
 in


terms
 of
 climbing?
 So
 if
 we
 I
 mean
 I've


got
 this
 this
 uh
 model
 here
 of


>> type.
 So
 you
 know,
 and
 this
 is
 also
 a


metaphor
 for
 any
 challenge
 I
 have
 in
 my


life.


>> But
 this
 is
 actually
 perfect
 because


it's
 right
 here.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 I
 scouted
 this
 in
 September
 of
 this


year.
 I
 did
 the
 climb
 in
 January.
 or


whatever.
 In
 September,
 we
 went
 and
 um


well,
 we
 had
 to
 like
 one
 make
 sure
 it


was
 possible
 before
 you
 sort
 of
 like


commit
 to
 it
 doing
 a
 whole
 TV
 program.


We
 were
 kind
 of
 like,
 let's
 make
 sure
 we


can
 do
 this.
 And
 then
 they
 also
 had
 to


get
 all
 this
 sort
 of
 marketing
 material.


You
 like
 get
 the
 photos
 with
 the


building,
 like
 all
 the
 stuff
 that


becomes
 the
 trailer
 and
 whatever.
 And
 so


we
 went
 in
 September
 to
 sort
 of
 like
 do


the
 prep.
 And
 so
 we
 I
 basically
 checked


out
 all
 the
 different
 pieces.
 And
 so


anywhere
 where
 you
 see
 it
 looking
 a


little
 bit
 different,
 you
 know,
 it's


like
 this
 whole
 bottom
 part
 is
 like
 a


low
 angle
 slab.
 It's
 like
 punctuated


with
 these
 two
 little
 rubies,
 these


little
 like
 coin
 things
 or
 whatever
 the


clouds
 or
 whatever
 they
 are.
 And
 then


there
 the
 dragons
 on
 the
 corners.
 These


are
 all
 overhanging.
 Like
 each
 of
 these


eight
 blocks
 is
 like
 a
 big
 overhanging


thing.
 It
 feels
 a
 little
 bit
 different.


Then
 you
 get
 up
 here,
 there's
 like
 these


balconies.
 These
 are
 actually


overhanging.
 Like
 basically
 each
 little


segment
 of
 this
 is
 quite
 different.
 And


you
 know,
 obviously
 on
 this
 model
 like


looks
 looks
 the
 same,
 but
 um
 each


transition
 between
 the
 different
 pieces


is
 like
 a
 thing.
 So
 I
 checked
 out
 all
 of


them
 with
 ropes
 and
 and
 yeah,
 you
 just


go
 piece
 by
 piece
 all
 the
 way
 up
 the


whole
 thing.
 And
 you
 hadn't
 ever
 climbed


it
 before
 we
 saw
 it
 on
 Netflix
 live.


>> Well,
 I
 hadn't
 freed
 it.
 No,
 but
 I
 had


climbed
 it.
 I
 climbed
 all
 the
 pieces


with
 a
 rope
 for
 sure.
 I'd
 like
 checked


out
 the
 different
 things.


>> Okay.
 So,
 so
 you
 you
 look
 at
 these
 as


individual
 challenges
 every
 step.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 like
 you
 go
 Well,
 even
 like


just
 getting
 off
 the
 ground,
 the
 first


move
 is
 a
 slightly
 different
 move
 than


any
 of
 the
 other
 moves.
 You
 have
 to
 like


jump
 up
 to
 a
 thing
 and
 like
 press
 it


out.
 Um
 then
 climbing
 over
 these
 little


clouds
 is
 a
 different
 thing.
 Each
 dragon


is
 a
 different
 thing.
 Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean


it's
 just,
 you
 know,
 there's
 a


surprising
 amount
 of
 complexity
 to
 it.


And
 so
 our
 first
 on
 the
 scout,
 you
 know,


I
 had
 a
 note
 on
 my
 phone
 and
 I'm
 just


like
 writing
 down
 all
 the
 different


basically
 I'm
 trying
 to
 learn
 it
 the
 way


you
 study
 anything
 where
 I'm
 just
 like


making
 notes
 and
 sort
 of
 like
 from
 floor


54
 to
 72
 it
 feels
 like
 this.
 I
 climb
 the


southeast
 corner
 the
 left
 ar
 you
 know


just
 and
 then
 yeah
 just
 writing
 it
 all


down


>> and
 I
 mean
 there's
 this
 famous
 photo
 of


you
 hanging
 with
 your
 leg.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 this
 these
 are
 the
 rings
 up


here.


>> So
 you're
 hanging
 you're
 hanging
 here


from
 here
 with
 your
 leg.
 Yeah.
 Now,
 I


this
 is
 really
 a
 question
 of
 endurance.


Like,
 how
 do
 you
 plan
 to
 have
 the


energy?


Like,
 how
 do
 you
 know
 if
 you're
 going to


have
 enough
 energy
 when
 you're
 up
 here


when
 you're
 just
 planning
 it?
 Well,


>> I
 mean,
 what
 this
 this
 is
 what
 makes
 it


exciting
 because
 you
 can't
 be
 sure.
 But,


you
 know,
 I've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 climbing
 in


my
 life,
 and
 I've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 climbs


that
 were
 like
 24
 hours.
 I
 mean,
 I
 had


this
 experience
 in
 Patagonia
 once.
 It


was
 a
 54-hour
 push.
 Like,
 the
 last
 20


hours
 we
 hiked
 without
 food
 um
 cuz
 we


got
 caught
 in
 a
 storm.
 It's
 a
 whole


crazy
 story.
 But
 basically,
 you
 know,


I've
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 experiences
 in
 my
 life


where
 I've
 done
 hard
 exercise
 for
 more


than
 24
 hours.
 And
 so
 this,
 you
 know,
 I


expect
 it
 to
 take
 me
 somewhere
 in
 the


hour
 and
 a
 half,
 two
 hour
 range.
 And
 I'm


kind
 of
 like,
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 I'll
 be


tired
 after
 2
 hours
 of
 exercise,
 but
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 be
 exhausted.
 You
 know what


I
 mean?
 Like,
 I
 know
 that
 I
 have
 a
 much


deeper
 reserve
 than
 that.


>> So
 much
 of
 the
 conversation
 around
 um


after
 you'
 done
 this,
 or
 some
 of
 the


conversation
 was
 around
 whether
 this
 was


a
 harder
 challenge
 than
 Al
 Capitan.


>> No,
 no,
 it's
 obviously
 much
 easier.
 I


mean,
 I'm
 doing
 on
 live
 television,
 you


know,
 it's
 like
 obviously
 it's
 easier,


but
 what
 makes
 it
 cool
 is
 that
 it's


different.
 It's
 fun.
 It's
 challenging.


Like
 for
 me,
 it's
 really
 like
 in
 my


sweet
 spot
 where
 it
 is
 challenging


enough
 like
 it's
 it's
 not
 easy.
 You
 know


what
 I
 mean?
 Like
 saying
 easier
 than


LCAP,
 it
 doesn't,
 you
 know,
 LCAP
 was


like
 a
 10-year
 life
 project
 that
 I
 did


in
 absolute
 secrecy.
 I
 did
 it
 on
 my


terms
 on
 the
 correct
 day
 after
 years
 of


effort.
 I
 had
 failed
 attempts.
 I
 you


know
 what
 I
 like
 LCAP
 was
 like
 an


allconsuming
 life
 project
 for
 years
 kind


of
 like
 obviously
 you
 can't
 do
 that
 for


live
 TV.
 It's
 like
 you
 just
 can't
 put


anyway


>> but
 this
 was
 very
 much
 in
 my
 sweet
 spot


where
 you're
 like
 oh
 it's
 hard
 enough


that
 it's
 that
 it's
 hard
 like
 it's
 cool


you
 know
 like
 it's
 fun
 it's
 interesting


the
 climbing
 is
 engaging
 it's
 you
 know


gave
 me
 something
 to
 train
 for
 for


months
 it's
 like
 it's
 super
 fun
 but
 it's


not
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 like
 the
 absolute


limit
 of
 what
 I
 can
 do
 because
 you
 just


can't
 do
 that
 on
 live
 TV.
 I
 mean,
 if


nothing
 else,
 so
 I
 was
 climbing
 the


southeast
 because
 it
 gets
 good
 morning


light
 and
 it
 looks
 beautiful
 and
 it's


like
 great
 for
 filming.
 But
 if
 I
 was


trying
 to
 do
 the
 absolute
 most
 cutting


edge
 climb
 I
 could
 do,
 I'd
 be
 climbing


the
 northwest
 arette
 because
 it'd
 be


full
 shade
 because
 it'd
 be
 good
 better


conditions,
 you
 know,
 be
 colder.
 Like


you
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in
 the
 sun.
 It


makes
 your
 skin,
 you
 know,
 makes
 you
 hot


and
 stuff.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 so,
 you
 know,
 just
 things
 like
 that.


You're
 like,
 well,
 if
 you're
 doing
 it


for
 TV
 and
 you're
 trying
 to
 broadcast


it,
 then
 you
 want
 it
 to
 look
 good.
 But


like,
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 do
 it
 for
 hard


climbing
 and
 good
 conditions,
 you
 do
 in


full
 shade.
 And
 Netflix
 had
 a
 10-second


delay
 just
 in
 case
 you
 fell.


>> I
 mean,
 I'm
 sure
 part
 of
 it
 is
 in
 case


you
 fall,
 but
 part
 of
 it's
 like,
 what
 if


somebody
 unplugs
 one
 of
 the
 things
 or,


you
 know what
 I
 mean?
 Like,
 it's
 so


complicated.
 There's
 so
 much
 stuff
 going


on,
 it's
 insane.


>> Was
 there
 a
 hardest
 part
 of
 this
 a
 part


where
 you
 were
 at
 all
 nervous?


>> The
 thing
 I
 was
 most
 nervous
 about
 when


I
 started
 was
 were
 the
 bamboo
 boxes,


like
 doing
 these
 eight
 overhanging


segments
 cuz
 they're
 just
 so


relentlessly
 the
 same
 move
 and
 it's
 just


it's
 pretty
 physical
 like
 you
 get
 tired


for
 sure.
 I
 mean,
 the
 actual
 physical


hardest
 moves,
 um,
 like
 actually


randomly
 one
 of
 these
 corners
 up
 here


would
 have
 been
 quite
 a
 hard
 move,
 but


there
 was
 this
 freaking
 security
 camera


bolted
 onto
 the
 wall.
 And
 so,
 you
 use


the
 security
 camera
 as
 this
 handle.
 It


was
 really
 freaking
 cool.
 And
 it
 was


like
 bolted
 on
 with
 these
 giant
 bolts,


so
 it
 like
 looked
 super
 safe
 and,
 you


know,
 it
 was
 like
 very
 robust
 and


secure,
 but
 it
 would
 have
 been
 kind
 of


like
 this
 extreme
 jump,
 which
 I
 wasn't,


you
 know,
 it's
 probably
 possible,
 but


would
 have
 been
 like
 a
 major
 thing,
 but


instead
 you
 just
 reef
 off
 the
 security


camera.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 that's
 so
 cool.


It
 was
 uh
 so
 there
 are
 a
 few
 things
 like


that
 like
 individual
 moves
 that
 are
 kind


of
 muscly
 but
 overall
 it's
 the
 the


stamina
 like
 the
 challenge
 of
 doing
 this


over
 and
 over
 for
 hundreds
 of
 feet
 that


was
 the
 hardest
 thing.


>> Do
 you
 have
 a
 conversation
 with
 your


with
 your
 girls
 and
 wife
 before
 you
 go


and
 do
 something
 like
 this
 about
 just
 in


case
 you
 don't
 come
 back?
 I
 know
 the


>> not
 with
 the
 kids
 cuz
 they're
 too
 young


and
 like
 they
 wouldn't
 they
 don't


understand
 it
 anyway.
 Um
 and
 not
 with


her
 because
 she
 came
 with
 me
 to
 Taipei


or
 she
 was
 there
 for
 like
 the
 whole
 end


of
 I
 went
 a
 little
 bit
 earlier
 so
 I


could
 adapt
 to
 the
 time
 zone
 more
 and


like
 feel
 better.
 But
 um
 but
 basically


she
 was
 with
 me
 so
 you
 know
 like
 we
 went


to
 bed
 together
 that
 night
 and
 like
 woke


up
 that
 morning
 and
 had
 breakfast


together.
 So
 it
 didn't
 feel
 like
 a
 big


goodbye.
 You
 know
 it
 was
 kind
 of


actually
 she
 was
 with
 me
 at
 the
 base


like
 we
 did
 the
 start
 together
 and
 then


I
 literally
 was
 like
 okay
 bye
 and
 walked


over
 and
 did
 the
 thing
 and
 saw
 her
 again


going
 to
 the
 top.
 So
 we
 were
 only
 apart


for
 like
 an
 hour
 and
 a
 half
 of
 the
 whole


you
 know
 like
 and
 I
 saw
 her
 through
 the


window
 a
 couple
 times
 and
 so
 it
 felt


like
 she
 was
 just
 there
 having
 the
 whole


experience
 with
 me.


>> Did
 you
 look
 at
 other
 buildings
 in
 the


world
 like
 like
 the
 Burge?
 So,
 yeah,


I've
 scouted
 the
 Burge
 twice
 over
 the


years.
 Um,
 back
 when
 this
 project,
 this


project
 almost
 happened
 in
 2013
 or


something
 and
 so
 I'd
 scouted
 some


buildings
 then.
 The
 Burge
 was
 just
 a


little
 too
 extreme.
 It's
 just
 too
 hard.


But
 someday
 maybe,
 who
 knows?


>> Cuz
 it's
 what?
 Like
 there's
 not
 enough.


It's
 too
 slippery.


>> Um,
 yeah,
 super
 slippery.
 Also,
 it's


just
 the
 way
 the
 holds
 are.
 Like
 I
 mean,


the
 beauty
 of
 Typo
 101
 is
 that
 the
 holds


like
 they're
 good
 things
 to
 hold
 that


are
 close
 together
 and
 you're
 just
 like


and
 you
 can
 hold
 them
 and
 you
 feel


secure.
 the
 Burge.
 I
 can
 barely
 span
 tip


to
 tip
 to
 like
 reach
 between
 the
 holds.


>> And
 so
 then
 your
 face
 is
 like
 right


against
 the
 glass.
 You're
 like
 holding


on
 like
 this.
 And
 it's
 pretty
 hard.
 And


you
 have
 to
 do
 the
 same
 thing
 112
 times


in
 a
 row.
 It's
 like
 pretty
 hard
 to
 do
 it


once
 then
 you
 have
 to
 do
 100
 times.


You're
 like
 it's
 kind
 of
 hard.


>> The
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 saw
 um
 online


after
 you'd
 climbed
 it
 about
 one
 or
 two


days
 after
 everyone
 talk
 started
 talking


about
 how
 much
 you
 were
 paid
 to
 do
 it.


>> I
 think
 cuz
 you
 did
 an
 interview.


>> It's
 funny.
 There
 were
 some
 quotes
 that


were
 kind
 of
 taken
 out
 of
 context


because
 yeah,
 a
 New
 York
 Times
 reporter


asked
 me
 how
 much
 I
 was
 getting
 paid
 and


I
 was
 kind
 of like
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 talk


about
 it
 cuz
 it's
 kind
 of
 embarrassing


cuz
 all
 my
 friends
 it's
 like
 an


embarrassingly
 high
 amount
 for
 my


community.
 Like
 in
 the
 climbing
 world
 if


you're
 getting
 paid
 to
 rock
 climb
 you're


like
 great
 success,
 you're
 getting
 paid


to
 climb.
 That's
 insane,
 you
 know?
 And


so
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 like
 sort
 of
 an


embarrassingly
 large
 amount.
 I'm
 like


this
 is
 kind
 of
 weird.
 But
 then
 he
 sort


of
 poked
 around
 and
 he
 started
 comparing


it
 to
 like
 boxing
 matches
 and
 stuff


where
 people
 get
 paid
 like
 $20
 million


to
 like
 fight
 someone
 boxing.
 And
 I
 was


like,
 "Well,
 no,
 compared
 to
 that,
 it's


an
 embarrassingly
 small
 amount."
 You


know,
 it's
 like
 or
 if
 you
 compare
 it
 to


like
 major
 league
 baseball
 contracts
 and


things
 and
 it's
 like,
 "Yeah,
 it's
 an


embarrassingly
 small
 amount,
 but
 I
 was


never
 complaining.
 Like,
 I
 thought
 it


was
 great.
 I
 mean,
 I
 would
 do
 it
 for


free.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 paid
 money
 to
 go
 up


to
 the
 observation
 deck.
 The
 observation


deck
 is
 way
 up
 here
 at
 the
 top
 and
 the


view
 is
 insane
 and
 the
 city's


incredible."
 And,
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 20


bucks
 or
 whatever
 to
 take
 the
 world's


fastest
 elevator
 to
 the
 top
 of
 the


building.
 And
 you
 know,
 I've
 done
 that


in
 the
 Burge
 as
 well
 where
 you
 like
 pay


the
 money
 and
 you
 go
 to
 the
 very
 top
 of


the
 building
 and
 the
 view
 is
 insane.


It's
 like
 I
 do
 that
 like
 anywhere
 I


travel
 like
 the
 Se
 the
 Willis
 Tower,


whatever
 the
 Sears
 Tower
 in
 Chicago.


Like
 I've
 paid
 the
 money
 to
 go
 to
 the


observation
 deck
 and
 see
 the
 view
 and


it's
 so
 cool.
 And
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like
 if


someone's
 willing
 to
 pay
 me
 to
 climb
 up


to
 the
 observation
 deck,
 that's
 freaking


cool.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 it's
 because
 people
 again


they're
 they're
 saying
 that
 they
 believe


that
 this
 is
 you're
 risking
 your
 entire


life.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 so
 yeah,
 they
 don't


think
 of
 boxes
 as
 risking
 their
 entire


life
 in
 the
 same
 way.


>> They
 kind
 of
 are.


>> Unless
 they
 are.
 Yeah.
 But
 they
 don't


see
 it
 as
 that.


>> I
 know.
 Of
 course
 they
 don't
 see
 it
 as


that.
 And
 that's
 totally
 understandable.


I
 get
 that.
 But
 I
 see
 it
 as
 like
 anybody


going
 into
 the
 boxing
 ring,
 particularly


if
 they're
 very
 mismatched,
 you
 know,


like
 you
 would
 think
 that
 there
 is
 some


real
 chance
 of
 grievous
 injury
 or
 like


death,


>> you
 know?
 It's
 like
 it's
 insane.


>> And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 people
 over
 the


thing
 is
 I
 think
 people
 that
 don't
 know


anything
 about
 anything
 like
 don't
 know


anything
 about
 climbing
 look
 at
 me


climbing
 a
 building.
 They're
 like
 it's


50/50
 if
 he
 lives
 or
 dies.
 Like
 no
 idea.


And
 you're
 like
 no.
 If
 you
 put
 this
 in


the
 context
 of
 all
 the
 things
 that
 I've


gone
 in
 my
 life,
 I
 felt
 very
 confident


that
 I
 wouldn't
 fall
 off
 the
 building.


You
 know,
 I
 was
 like,
 you
 know,


obviously
 it's
 never
 100%
 because
 like


whatever
 it's
 life,
 but
 you
 know,
 it


feels
 like
 100%.
 You're
 like,
 oh,


there's
 no
 chance
 I'm
 falling
 off
 this


building.


>> The
 rumors
 were
 that
 you
 got
 500k
 to


climb
 it
 from
 Netflix.


>> Throughout
 my
 whole
 like,
 you
 know,


quote
 unquote
 career
 as
 a
 climber,
 I


basically
 have
 never
 worried
 about
 money


and
 I've
 always
 just
 tried
 to
 do
 the


thing
 and
 let
 it
 all
 play
 out
 at
 the


end.
 And
 so
 I've
 done
 a
 ton
 of
 work
 for


free
 over
 the
 years.
 Oh,
 like
 actually


we
 were
 talking
 about
 that
 Halfdme
 film


earlier
 where
 it's
 like
 I'm
 shuffling


along.
 It's
 like
 I
 did
 that
 film
 for


free.
 I
 did
 tons
 of
 films
 like
 that
 for


free.
 Uh
 just
 because
 you're
 kind
 of


like,
 "Oh,
 it's
 part
 of
 being
 a


professional
 climber
 and
 I
 get
 to
 go


climbing
 and
 I'm
 up
 with
 my
 friends


filming
 on
 a
 thing."
 You're
 just
 like,


"You're
 working
 for
 free.
 It's
 fine."


But
 by
 doing
 all
 that
 stuff
 for
 free,


like
 I
 never
 I
 never
 stress
 the
 day


rate.
 Never,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 like,
 I


don't
 need
 to
 get
 paid
 to
 go
 have
 fun


with
 my
 friends
 on
 a
 wall.
 Like
 it's


fine.
 But
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that
 film,
 you


know,
 a
 year
 or
 two
 later,
 they
 wind
 up


doing
 a
 photo
 shoot
 out
 there
 for
 the


cover
 of
 National
 Geographic.
 And
 so
 you


just
 wind
 up
 in
 other
 things
 and
 then


and
 then
 that
 got
 seen
 and
 I
 wound
 up


being
 profiled
 by
 60
 Minutes,
 which


actually
 was
 one
 of the
 first
 sort
 of


career
 inflection
 points.
 It
 was
 like


the
 60
 Minutes
 profile
 in
 2011
 or


something.
 But
 basically,
 I've
 done
 a


ton
 of
 work
 for
 free
 over
 my
 life
 as
 all


part
 of
 like
 it's
 all
 part
 of
 the
 game


and
 I
 just
 love
 playing
 the
 game.
 And
 so


you
 just
 like
 let
 it
 play
 out.
 And
 it's


funny
 because
 with
 this
 building,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 thought
 that
 I
 was
 sort
 of


underpaid
 by
 it,
 but
 afterward,


you
 know,
 some
 people
 have
 approached
 me


about
 some
 bonuses
 and
 some
 other
 work


stuff
 and
 like
 basically
 a
 lot
 has


already
 sort
 of
 happened
 and
 it's
 only


been
 a
 couple
 weeks
 since
 the
 building.


And
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like,
 you
 know,
 you


don't
 need
 to
 get
 paid
 for
 the
 thing


itself
 cuz
 it
 always
 works
 basically.


I'm
 kind
 of
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 I'm
 like,


don't
 get
 hung
 up
 on
 how
 much
 you
 get


paid.
 Just
 do
 the
 thing.
 Make
 sure
 it's


freaking
 rad
 and
 it
 all
 sorts
 itself


out.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That
 I
 mean
 that's
 also
 been


like
 um
 the
 that's
 completely
 true
 for


my
 life
 as
 well.
 Even
 this
 podcast
 like


when
 we
 started
 the
 podcast
 in
 my


kitchen
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 a
 replica
 of
 my


kitchen
 and
 Jack
 was
 here.
 There
 was
 no


pay
 there
 was
 no
 payment
 when
 we
 started


it.


>> You're
 just
 doing
 a
 thing.
 You
 make
 it


as
 good
 as
 you
 can
 and
 eventually
 it
 all


sort
 of
 works
 and
 you're
 like
 cool.


>> I've
 I
 because
 that
 that
 pattern
 you've


just
 described
 has
 played
 out
 for
 15


years
 of
 my
 life.
 I
 now
 and
 again
 my
 my


CFO
 and
 my
 commercial
 director
 might
 not


love
 me
 saying
 this
 but
 they
 know
 this


about
 me
 is
 and
 we
 even
 talked
 about
 it


recently
 with
 a
 particular
 project
 is


like
 don't
 let
 the
 inability
 to
 see


where
 the
 money
 is
 going
 to
 come
 from
 in


the
 near
 term
 stop
 you
 pursuing


something
 that
 you
 think
 is
 going
 to


create
 value
 because
 history
 shows
 that


actually
 value
 like
 giving
 value
 out


into
 the
 world
 precedes


the
 the
 e
 the
 economics
 totally.
 And
 so


if
 it
 happened
 15
 years
 of
 my
 life
 where


I
 remember
 when
 I
 started
 the
 social


media
 business
 and
 people
 some
 a
 guy
 sat


me
 down
 in
 Google
 in
 London
 and


explained
 to
 me
 why
 I
 would
 never
 make


money
 from
 that
 business.
 He
 like
 he
 did


the
 math
 for
 me
 and
 the
 math
 was
 solid.


>> He
 was
 like
 if
 you
 do
 once
 a
 day
 you


won't
 make
 any
 money.
 And
 I
 was
 like


>> you're
 like
 yeah
 but
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 true.
 You
 know
 you're
 like


>> and
 you
 have
 no
 evidence
 but


>> yeah
 but
 you
 just
 know
 it's
 going to


work.


>> Yeah.
 The
 Uber
 CEO
 sat
 here
 with
 me


yesterday
 in
 that
 scene
 and
 he
 was


telling
 me
 he
 was
 like
 the
 thing
 is


there's
 this
 thing
 called
 Jevans
 paradox


where
 when
 yeah
 when
 become
 more


efficient
 whatever
 people
 think
 of


things
 in
 linear
 progression
 but


actually
 there's
 exponential


progression.
 So
 when
 we
 launched
 Uber


more
 people
 started
 taking
 taxis.
 So
 all


of
 the
 models
 about
 how
 big
 this
 market


were
 were
 all
 wrong.
 And
 I
 find
 the
 same


in
 that
 and
 I
 found
 the
 same
 in
 about
 5


years
 ago
 was
 yeah
 like
 you
 set
 me
 down


and
 go
 well
 Steve
 CPMs
 you're
 going
 to


have
 to
 be
 getting
 a
 million
 downloads


to
 make
 like
 to
 earn
 a
 living
 like
 but


>> like
 wait
 and
 see.


>> Yeah
 thing
 and
 let
 it
 let
 it
 happen.


>> I
 mean
 you're
 a
 prime
 example
 of
 that.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 always
 better
 to
 focus
 your


energy
 on
 being
 the
 best
 at
 the
 thing


that
 you're
 trying
 to
 do
 than
 figuring


out
 how
 to
 monetize
 it
 or
 you
 know
 make


money
 off
 of
 it.
 It's
 like
 I
 don't
 know.


I
 mean,
 my
 whole
 like
 life
 as
 a
 climber,


I've
 always
 tried
 to
 focus
 on
 like
 how


do
 you
 send,
 which
 in
 climbing
 terms


means
 like
 do
 the
 hard
 thing.
 Like
 you


always
 focus
 on
 sending
 and
 then


everything
 else
 follows.


>> Whoa.
 What's
 that
 on
 your
 face?


>> This
 is
 my
 Bon
 Charge
 face
 mask.
 I've


been
 wearing
 this
 for
 some
 time
 now.


They're
 a
 sponsor
 of
 the
 podcast.
 I
 put


this

 15

 minutes
 a
 day.
 I
 can


sit
 here
 in
 the
 chair
 and
 wear
 it.

 fine

complexion

 then

more

 I
 I


look
 better.

 such
 a
 small
 box.
 It's
 noninvasive.


And
 having
 sat
 here
 with
 so
 many
 of
 the


world's
 leading
 health
 professionals,


there's
 various
 things
 that
 I
 repeatedly


hear
 work
 and
 some
 things
 I'm
 a
 bit


skeptical
 about.
 This
 is
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 almost
 all
 of
 my
 guests
 on


this
 show
 have
 confirmed
 works.
 It
 is


really,
 really,
 really
 effective.

they

all
 of
 their

The
 deal
 applies
 sitewide.
 I've
 had
 so


many
 founders
 speak
 to
 me
 and
 say,
 "Why


didn't
 this
 particular
 ad
 that
 I
 ran
 on


this
 platform
 work
 for
 me?"
 Maybe
 the


copy
 wasn't
 good.
 the
 creative
 wasn't


strong,
 but
 usually
 the
 problem
 is


they're
 not
 having
 the
 right


conversation
 because
 that
 ad
 never


reached
 the
 right
 person.
 And
 if
 you're


in
 B2B
 marketing,
 that
 is
 much
 of
 the


game.
 And
 this
 is
 where
 LinkedIn
 ads


solves
 that
 problem
 for
 you.
 Their


targeting
 is
 ridiculously
 specific.
 You


can
 target
 by
 job
 title,
 seniority,


company
 size,
 industry,
 and
 even


someone's
 skill
 set.
 And
 their
 network


includes
 over
 a
 billion
 professionals.


About
 130
 million
 of
 them
 are
 decision


makers.
 So,
 when
 you
 use
 LinkedIn
 ads,


you're
 putting
 your
 brand
 in
 front
 of


the
 right
 people.
 And
 LinkedIn
 ads
 also


drive
 the
 highest
 B2B
 return
 on
 ad
 spend


across
 all
 ad
 networks
 in
 my
 experience.


If
 you
 want
 to
 give
 them
 a
 try,
 head


over
 to
 linkedin.com/diary.


And
 when
 you
 spend
 $250
 on
 your
 first


LinkedIn
 ads
 campaign,
 you'll
 get
 an


extra
 $250
 credit
 from
 me
 for
 the
 next


one.
 That's
 linkedin.com/diary.


Terms
 and

It's
 funny
 you
 you
 talking
 about


mortality
 earlier
 on
 and
 um
 I
 think
 in


the
 last
 couple
 of
 years
 my
 mortality


like
 realizing
 that
 I'm
 going to
 die


someday
 has
 been
 such
 a
 a
 wonderful


thing
 to
 to
 really
 remind
 myself
 of
 and


like
 a
 frequent
 basis.


>> What
 uh
 how
 come?


>> Just
 because
 Okay,
 so
 there's
 many


things.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 um


the
 whole
 idea
 of
 like
 sunk
 cost
 bias


where
 you
 become
 successful
 at
 a
 thing


and
 you
 and
 now
 you
 have
 something
 to


lose.
 So
 people
 go
 into
 a
 state
 of
 loss


aversion
 where
 they
 start
 to
 protect


what
 they
 have.
 Totally.


>> And
 this
 narrows
 your
 life
 in
 a
 way


where
 you
 stop
 taking
 challenges,
 stop


taking
 risks,
 stop
 doing
 new
 things.


>> And
 the
 other
 thing
 generally
 about


knowing
 you're
 going
 to
 die
 and
 really


like
 reminding
 yourself
 of
 that
 is
 it


liberates
 you
 from
 getting
 caught
 up
 and


worrying
 about
 things
 that
 in
 the
 grand


scheme
 of
 like
 cosmic
 reality
 are
 like


totally
 inconsequential.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 was
 I
 was
 hearing
 someone
 say
 the


other
 day
 like
 do
 you
 know
 the
 the
 name


of
 your
 great-grandfather?


>> Do
 you
 know
 do
 you
 know
 his
 first
 name?


>> Not
 really.
 And
 do
 you
 know
 the
 life


they
 lived
 and
 what
 they
 were
 worried


about
 and
 how
 they
 were
 embarrassed
 and


their
 shame.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 No,
 you
 don't
 know
 any
 of


that.


>> And
 the
 point
 is
 like
 if
 you
 don't
 even


know
 your
 own
 family's


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> [ __ ]


>> Like
 nobody
 else
 cares.
 Yeah.


>> But
 even
 like
 extremely
 famous
 people
 a


couple
 of
 weeks
 after
 they
 trend
 on


Twitter
 and
 then
 a
 week
 later
 everyone


just
 like
 gets
 on
 with
 their
 life
 again.


>> Totally.
 Well,
 I'm
 already
 experiencing


that
 with
 with
 this
 stuff,
 you
 know,


like
 the
 building
 was
 like
 insane
 for
 a


moment,
 but
 now
 it's
 the
 Olympics
 and


there's
 a
 lot
 going
 on
 in
 the
 news
 cycle


and
 it's
 like
 the
 world's
 moved
 on.
 I'm


like
 great.
 I'll
 go
 back
 to
 just
 like


being
 at
 home
 with
 my
 family
 and


climbing
 as
 much
 as
 I
 can.


>> Being
 at
 home
 with
 your
 family,
 you
 said


earlier
 that
 when
 you're
 in
 that
 van
 for


10
 years,
 you
 wanted
 a
 girlfriend.


>> Yeah.


>> Now,
 I'm
 not
 being
 funny,
 but
 people


that
 fit
 your
 profile
 and
 uh
 to
 some


degree,
 people
 that
 fit
 my
 profile


struggle
 in
 intimate
 relationships
 for
 a


variety
 of
 reasons.
 And
 I
 think
 I


actually
 saw
 this
 in
 the
 documentary


when
 I
 watched
 Free
 Solo.
 I
 saw
 you
 had


a
 partner
 at
 the
 time.
 There
 was
 an


accident
 on
 the
 cliff
 side
 where
 you


fell
 and
 she
 was
 supposed
 to
 be


protecting
 you.


>> Mhm.
 And
 generally
 I
 just
 saw
 someone


who
 probably
 is
 more
 on
 the
 um
 less


affectionate,
 more
 commitment
 avoidant


side
 of
 life.
 Is
 that
 accurate?


>> I
 don't
 know
 about
 commitment
 avoidant


because
 actually
 I
 have
 had
 long-term


girlfriends
 and
 things
 but
 but
 yeah,


definitely
 I'm
 like
 less
 expressive.
 I'm


less
 emotionally
 intelligent
 than
 my


wife.


>> Has
 she
 ever
 given
 you
 feedback
 that
 she


wishes
 you
 were
 more
 emotionally


uh
 available?
 I
 mean,
 I
 get
 that.


>> I
 mean,
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 in
 in
 different


words
 perhaps,
 but
 yeah,
 basically


>> Sonnie.


>> Yeah,
 Sonnie


>> is
 her
 name.


>> She
 wrote
 a
 letter.


>> Oh
 gosh,


>> that's
 funny
 because
 the
 first
 two
 words


are,
 "Oh
 gosh,
 an
 intimate
 letter
 out


loud."


>> Oh
 gosh,
 she
 she
 does
 know
 me.


>> Obviously,
 this
 is
 your
 worst
 nightmare,


she
 said.


>> That's
 She
 knows
 me
 so
 well.


>> But
 we
 all
 have
 to
 do
 scary
 things


sometimes,
 Alex.


>> Ah,
 my
 coach.


She
 said,
 "I
 remember
 when
 you
 read
 a


book
 once
 about
 a
 woman
 who
 said
 she
 was


less
 affected
 by
 emotions
 than
 most


people.
 For
 her
 entire
 life,
 people


tried
 to
 convince
 her
 that
 she
 was


wrong,
 that
 she
 was
 suppressing
 her


feelings,
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 she


just
 wasn't."
 As
 you
 were
 reading,
 you


turned
 to
 me
 and
 said
 something
 similar,


something
 like,
 "Everyone
 wants
 to


believe
 that
 I'm
 burying
 all
 these


things,
 these
 feelings
 deep
 inside,
 but


I'm
 just
 not."
 And
 I
 laughed
 and
 I


joked,
 "Don't
 worry.
 I
 know
 you're
 dead


inside.
 If
 I
 remember
 correctly,
 you


gave
 me
 a
 hug.
 But
 I've
 thought
 about


this
 conversation
 a
 lot
 because
 as
 the


person
 married
 to
 you,
 I
 spend
 a
 lot
 of


time
 trying
 to
 understand
 you.
 And
 while


there
 obviously
 are
 emotions
 that
 drive


you,
 I
 was
 mostly
 joking
 about
 the
 dead


inside
 part.
 I
 do
 think
 you
 are
 far
 less


affected
 by
 some
 feelings
 like
 anxiety,


fear,
 shame,
 guilt,
 or
 self-doubt
 than


many
 of
 us.
 But
 the
 longer
 I
 know
 you,


the
 more
 I
 see
 an
 ocean
 of
 something


else
 hiding
 beneath
 the
 surface.
 Filling


the
 space
 that
 would
 normally
 be
 taken


up
 by
 all
 these
 feelings
 is
 the
 ability


to
 truly
 see
 things.
 You
 move
 through


the
 world
 like
 a
 hawk
 while
 the
 rest
 of


us
 are
 lost
 in
 thought.
 As
 a
 climber,


you
 can
 see
 the
 way
 up
 a
 rock
 face,
 the


climbability
 of
 a
 building,
 or
 the


layered
 history
 of
 a
 mountain
 range.
 As


a
 father,
 you
 notice
 the
 quiet
 intrinsic


desires
 of
 your
 daughters
 or
 the
 chores


that
 need
 doing
 around
 the
 house.
 And
 as


a
 friend,
 you
 see
 the
 raw
 potential
 in


every
 person
 that
 you
 meet.
 Sometimes


this
 is
 the
 hardest
 thing
 about
 you.


Nothing
 goes
 unnoticed.
 Neither
 the


strengths
 nor
 the
 weaknesses,
 the


moments
 of
 dedication
 or
 the
 moments
 of


laziness.
 You
 are
 practical
 and
 blunt
 in


your
 assessment
 of
 your
 choices
 and
 our


lives.
 But
 that's
 also
 because
 you
 see


us.
 And
 paying
 attention
 is
 love.
 Your


ability
 to
 see
 the
 world
 so
 clearly


allows
 you
 to
 also
 appreciate
 it
 more


clearly.
 And
 that
 is
 a
 special
 form
 of


your
 love.
 Perhaps
 there's
 a
 well
 of


emotion
 in
 there
 after
 all.
 But
 but
 for


the
 purposes
 of
 this
 letter,
 Alex,
 I


want
 to
 give
 you
 your
 gift
 back
 to
 you


and
 tell
 you
 what
 what
 I
 see


particularly
 in
 the
 last
 four
 years


since
 we
 had
 kids
 because
 I
 think
 the


way
 you
 move
 through
 the
 world
 with
 us


is
 a
 unique
 love
 story.
 I
 see
 you


rushing
 down
 the
 trail
 from
 the
 climbing


area
 so
 you
 can
 get
 back
 in
 time
 for


dinner
 with
 me
 and
 the
 girls.
 I
 see
 you


flying
 the
 red
 eye
 so
 you
 can
 be
 home
 a


day
 sooner.
 I
 see
 you
 cramming
 in
 your


gym
 session
 even
 when
 you
 have
 a
 huge


goal
 on
 the
 horizon
 so
 that
 I
 have
 time


for
 my
 workout
 too.
 I
 see
 you
 pushing


your
 body
 to
 the
 absolute
 limit
 during


the
 day
 but
 still
 managing
 to
 stay
 awake


long
 enough
 to
 chat
 to
 me
 at
 night.
 I


see
 you
 taking
 on
 an
 extra
 day
 of
 travel


just
 to
 convince
 someone
 with
 money
 to


donate
 to
 your
 foundation
 and
 help
 save


the
 planet.
 I
 see
 you
 adjusting
 your


whole
 training
 schedule
 for
 work


opportunities
 in
 order
 to
 provide
 a


wonderful
 life
 for
 me
 and
 the
 girls.
 I


see
 the
 insane
 juggling
 act
 you
 do
 every


day
 to
 not
 only
 be
 a
 great
 athlete,
 but


a
 great
 dad
 and
 husband.
 I
 know
 it's
 not


easy,
 but
 I
 see
 it
 and
 I
 appreciate
 it.


We
 love
 you
 as
 you
 are,
 Alex.
 Not
 overly


emotional,
 but
 present,
 committed,
 and


always
 seeing
 what
 others
 miss.


Yours,


Sani,


she
 is
 very
 astute.
 I
 was
 like
 that's


I
 was
 like
 that's
 why
 I
 married
 her
 you


know


she
 is
 very
 astute.


Yeah.


I
 learned
 a
 lot
 about
 you
 from
 reading


this.


>> H
 what
 do
 you
 think?


>> You
 know
 we
 all
 show
 our
 love
 in


different
 ways
 and
 sometimes
 I
 think
 the


conventional
 way
 that
 the
 world
 tries
 to


measure
 love
 is
 through
 the
 like
 verbal


expression
 of
 it
 and
 romantic
 gestures


and
 those
 kinds
 of
 things.
 But
 there's


another
 type
 of
 person
 who
 often


struggles,
 I
 think,
 in
 in
 what
 life's


expectations
 of
 what
 love
 looks
 like,


who
 show
 it
 through
 acts
 of
 service.


That
 was
 that
 was
 literally
 one
 of
 our


last
 big
 arguments
 about
 something
 like


in
 bed
 the
 other
 night,
 not
 like
 a
 total


blowout,
 but
 basically
 she
 was
 sort
 of


like,
 I
 just
 need
 more,
 you
 know,
 of
 the


verbal
 kind.
 And
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 like,
 I'm


literally
 doing
 all
 the
 things.
 And
 I


always
 sort
 of
 say,
 you
 know,
 actions


speak
 louder
 than
 words.
 I'm
 kind
 of


like,
 if
 you're
 doing
 all
 the
 things,


you're
 doing
 the
 correct
 things.
 you


don't
 need
 to
 talk
 about
 them
 because


you're
 doing
 the
 things,
 you
 know,
 and


that
 was
 basically
 a
 a
 back
 and
 forth.
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 I
 took
 her
 point
 that


like
 occasionally
 you
 have
 to
 say
 the


right
 thing,
 too.


>> Well,
 I
 have
 the
 same
 the
 same
 argument


on
 repeat
 with
 my
 fiance.


>> H
 she
 needs
 the
 words,
 too.


>> Yeah.
 She
 has
 like
 a
 different
 language.


She's
 speaking
 Spanish.
 I'm
 speaking


French.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 also,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 have
 to
 say
 at


some
 deep
 level,
 again,
 because
 of
 my


early
 context
 where
 like
 you,
 I
 wished


my
 parents
 would
 break
 up.
 I
 wish
 they


would
 just
 get
 a
 divorce
 because
 the


model
 of
 love
 I
 saw
 was
 not
 a
 happy
 one.


I
 think
 at
 some
 deep
 level
 I
 have
 a


commitment
 problem
 or
 an
 intimacy


problem
 where


>> even
 growing
 up
 say
 calling
 someone
 my


best
 friend
 somewhat
 made
 me
 cringe.


>> Like
 saying
 saying
 affectionate
 words
 to


someone
 at
 some
 deep
 level
 made
 me
 feel


deeply
 uncomfortable


>> and
 so
 you
 can
 imagine
 me
 being
 ding
 and


then
 I
 think
 like
 often
 times
 we
 go
 for


the
 opposite
 in
 the
 person
 we
 end
 up
 mar


like
 marrying
 or


>> Yeah.
 Certainly
 for
 me.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Well
 certainly.


>> Yeah.
 My
 wife
 is
 like
 way
 more


emotionally
 intelligent
 than
 anyone
 in


my
 entire
 extended
 family.


>> Yeah,
 same.


>> This
 is
 how
 you
 build
 a
 rich
 life
 is


that
 you
 basically
 like
 I
 mean
 it's
 like


hiring.
 You
 find
 members
 of
 the
 team
 who


have
 all
 the
 strengths
 that
 you
 need
 and


it's
 like
 the
 things
 that
 you
 can't
 do


and


>> it's
 like
 filling
 your
 blind
 spots


basically.


>> Have
 you
 got
 better
 at
 saying
 the
 words?


>> No.


>> Any
 progress?


>> Uh
 yeah,
 progress
 probably.
 But
 very


slow.
 But
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 great,
 you


know,
 because
 we're
 going to
 be
 married


the
 rest
 of
 our
 lives
 and
 so
 that
 could


be
 another
 50
 60
 years
 together.
 And
 so


you
 need
 to
 see
 incremental
 progress,


you
 know,
 because
 really
 there's
 nothing


better
 in
 life
 than
 making
 progress.
 And


I've
 started
 at
 such
 a
 low
 point
 and
 I'm


making
 progress
 so
 slowly
 that
 I


basically
 have
 a
 good
 project
 for
 the


rest
 of
 my
 life.
 Oh,
 um,
 we
 kind
 of


touched
 on
 it
 before,
 but
 one
 of
 the


things
 that's
 been
 in
 front
 of
 mind
 for


me
 at
 the
 moment
 is,
 um,
 actually


something
 I
 saw
 in
 your
 personality


test,
 which
 was
 you
 were
 high
 in


perseverance.


And,
 uh,
 we
 talked
 earlier
 on
 about
 like


mastery
 and
 how
 it's
 important
 to,
 um,


persist
 to
 get
 good
 at
 something.
 But


this
 has
 just
 been
 front
 of
 mind
 for
 me


I
 think
 for
 a
 long
 time
 because
 even


like
 as
 a
 podcaster
 I
 realize
 that
 a
 lot


of
 the
 game
 I'm
 like
 five
 years
 in
 now


and
 um
 when
 I
 look
 at
 someone
 like
 Joe


Rogan
 he's
 been
 going
 for
 like
 I
 don't


know
 15
 17
 years


>> or
 more


>> and
 I
 go
 like
 so
 much
 of
 the
 game
 in


becoming
 great
 at
 something
 grinding


it's
 just
 going
 unusual
 amount
 of


>> it's
 like
 compounding
 interest.
 I'm
 like


look
 at
 Warren
 Buffett.
 Have
 you
 ever


seen
 stuff
 with
 Warren
 Buffett
 where


it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 it
 took
 him


whatever
 40
 years
 to
 make
 his
 first


couple
 million
 or
 whatever,
 took
 him


another
 like
 10
 or
 15
 years
 to
 make
 his


first
 billion
 and
 then
 it
 took
 him
 like


whatever
 in
 the
 last
 eight
 years
 he's


made
 like
 hundred
 billion
 dollars,
 you


know,
 cuz
 his
 whole
 wealth
 is
 like
 woo.


>> You're
 kind
 of
 like
 basically
 if
 you
 put


enough
 time
 into
 something
 and
 you
 let


it
 compound,
 it
 like
 slowly
 gets
 bigger


and
 bigger.


>> It's
 exactly
 that.
 And
 so
 I've
 been


thinking
 about
 like


>> So
 all
 those
 numbers
 are
 incorrect,
 but


the
 the
 shape
 of
 the
 graph
 is
 correct.


>> We'll
 put
 it
 on
 the
 screen
 so
 everyone


can
 see.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Somebody
 correct
 my


numbers.
 The
 principle
 is
 correct.


>> It's
 the
 same.
 It's
 the
 same
 as
 this


graph
 here
 that
 you
 drew
 of
 your
 career.


>> Um
 it's
 the
 same
 as
 the
 podcast
 growth


where
 three
 years
 no
 one
 was
 listening


and
 then
 we
 have
 this


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 I
 I
 think
 as
 a
 principle


>> that's
 why
 you
 focus
 on
 doing
 something


of
 value
 because
 with
 the
 podcast
 like


if
 you
 feel
 like
 you're
 doing
 something


useful
 and
 that
 you
 think
 is
 cool
 and


you
 think
 there's
 something
 there
 you


just
 keep
 doing
 it
 and
 eventually
 people


get
 on
 board.


>> Okay.
 So


on
 that
 train
 of
 thought,
 I've
 thought
 a


lot
 about
 how
 do
 I
 create
 the
 conditions


to
 outpersist
 other
 people
 in
 the
 areas


that
 I
 love.
 And
 one
 such
 thing,
 for


example,
 with
 a
 podcast
 is
 like
 never


have
 a
 conversation
 that
 I'm
 not
 looking


forward
 to


>> because
 that's
 unsustainable
 over
 the


long
 term.


>> Totally.
 Cuz
 then
 it
 feels
 like
 hard


work
 as
 opposed
 to
 something
 like
 this


is
 amazing.


>> Yeah.
 So
 when
 I
 look
 at
 my
 they'll
 say,


oh
 this
 person
 wants
 to
 come
 and
 they've


got
 160
 gazillion
 followers.


>> But
 you're
 like
 I
 don't
 care
 about
 that


person.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 if
 I
 if
 I
 use
 that
 as
 a


decision
 framework
 for the
 next
 10


years,
 I'll
 quit.


>> Yeah.


>> Do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 like
 the


conditions
 to
 out
 persist
 in
 your


domain?


>> I
 mean,
 kind
 of.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 haven't


had
 to
 think
 about
 it
 too
 much
 because
 I


freaking
 love
 climbing
 in
 all
 its
 forms.


And
 so,
 basically,
 climbing
 comes


easily,
 but
 like
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 work


stuff
 I
 do,
 um
 I
 forget
 I
 think
 I
 was


talking
 to
 you
 before
 we
 started


recording,
 but
 um
 but
 I
 host
 this


podcast
 called
 Planet
 Visionaries.
 Uh


it's
 like
 a
 Rolex
 Perpetual
 Planet.
 Like


I
 interview
 scientists
 and


conservationists
 and
 whatever.
 And
 for


whatever
 reason,
 every
 time
 I
 do
 those


podcasts,
 I
 come
 out
 of
 it
 feeling
 all


energized
 and
 like,
 I
 should
 train
 more.


I
 should
 study.
 I
 should
 learn


something.
 Basically,
 because
 the
 people


that
 I'm
 interviewing
 are
 all
 so


uniquely
 good
 at
 what
 they
 do,
 and


they're
 all
 trying
 to
 save
 the
 world
 in


different
 ways.
 It's
 like,
 you
 know,


marine
 biologists
 like
 exploring
 the


deep
 sea
 floor
 and
 things
 like
 that.


Yesterday,
 I
 interviewed
 these
 two
 uh


women
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 we've
 only


explored
 .001%
 of
 the
 deep
 sea,
 which


represents
 twothirds
 of
 the
 planet.
 So,


basically,
 twothirds
 of
 the
 planet
 we


know
 like
 literally
 nothing
 about.
 And


there's
 like
 this
 rich
 underwater


world
 of
 like
 cool
 stuff
 going
 on
 in
 the


ocean
 floor
 that
 we've
 never
 seen
 and


know
 nothing
 about
 and
 it's
 insane.
 I


was
 like
 that's
 so
 cool.
 And
 I
 got
 all


fired
 up
 about
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 come
 out
 of


work
 thing,
 you
 know,
 quote
 unquote
 work


things
 like
 that
 and
 I'm
 like
 energized


and
 excited
 to
 learn
 and
 grow,
 you
 know,


push
 myself
 and
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like
 that's


the
 type
 of
 work
 that
 I
 want
 to
 do
 as


much
 as
 possible.
 And
 then
 there
 are


other
 kinds
 of
 things
 where
 you
 know


I'll
 do
 like
 corporate
 speaking
 or


something
 where
 you
 show
 up
 at
 a


conference
 and
 you
 just
 like
 get
 ground


down
 you
 know
 when
 you
 leave
 and
 you
 go


back
 to
 your
 hotel
 and
 all
 you
 can
 do
 is


just
 like
 lie
 there
 on
 the
 bed
 for
 an


hour
 being
 like
 h
 what
 am
 I
 doing
 with


my
 life
 you
 know
 you
 feel
 like
 kind
 of


wrecked.


>> So
 it's
 like
 if
 you
 can
 focus
 on
 the


work
 where
 you
 come
 out
 of
 it
 feeling


inspired
 and
 like
 excited
 to
 try
 hard


versus
 the
 work
 that
 makes
 you
 want
 to


like
 mindlessly
 scroll
 on
 something
 for


hours.
 You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 Cuz


sometimes
 you're
 just
 like
 oh
 I'm
 just


so
 over
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Someone
 said
 that
 to
 me
 in
 my


career.
 I
 said
 like
 whenever
 you
 find


domains
 that
 make
 you
 feel
 expansive


like


>> totally


>> you
 should
 double
 down
 on
 those
 domains


cuz
 you're
 that's
 the
 path
 to
 mastery.


You're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 continue.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 you
 can
 just
 keep
 pushing


super
 hard
 in
 that


>> thankfully
 for
 climbing
 that's
 always


just
 been
 that
 like
 I
 just
 freaking
 love


climbing.
 It's
 so
 great.
 You
 should
 do


it
 more.


>> I
 know
 you
 you
 make
 us
 all
 want
 to
 climb


more,
 Alex.


>> That's
 one
 of
 the
 I
 think
 the
 great
 um


consequences
 of
 watching
 you
 do


something
 like
 Taipei.
 I
 mean,
 there
 was


loads
 of
 kids
 in
 the
 streets
 of
 Taipei,


I
 think,
 that
 were
 all
 trying
 to
 climb


buildings.
 There
 was
 loads
 of
 like
 funny


videos.
 Then,
 obviously,
 they
 were
 only


getting
 like
 a
 meter
 up
 before
 they


fell.


>> I
 was
 like,
 hopefully
 they
 don't
 Yeah,


hopefully
 it's
 not
 too
 much
 copycatting,


but
 yeah,
 we
 got
 some
 crazy
 numbers
 from


Netflix
 that
 I
 think
 half
 of
 people
 or


more
 than
 half
 of
 people
 who
 have
 a


Netflix
 subscription
 in
 in
 Taiwan


watched
 the
 building
 climb
 on
 uh
 it's


like
 in
 in
 Taiwan,
 it
 was
 like
 insane.


Like,
 literally
 everybody
 watch.
 It's


it's
 such
 a
 it's
 such
 a
 singular


striking
 building
 in
 in
 Taipei.
 It's


like
 a
 total
 national
 icon,
 you
 know?


It's
 like
 a
 it's
 it's
 insane.


>> Have
 you
 already
 started
 thinking
 about


what
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 next?


>> People
 are
 always
 like,
 you
 know,
 what's


your
 next
 big
 thing?
 And
 I'm
 kind
 of


like,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 just
 focus
 on


doing
 lots
 of
 little
 things
 all
 the


time,
 occasionally
 the
 big
 things
 just


happen
 and
 you
 can't
 totally
 know
 ahead


of
 time.
 You
 know what
 I
 mean?


>> That's
 me.


>> Well,
 so
 at least,
 so
 I
 mean,
 I
 have


climbing
 goals
 going
 back
 20
 years.
 I


have
 all
 these
 notes
 on
 my
 phone.
 I


always
 have
 like
 to-do
 lists.
 of


especially
 when
 I
 lived
 in
 the
 van
 and
 I


was
 traveling,
 you're
 like
 seasonally


moving
 between
 climbing
 destinations


non-stop.
 So
 I'd
 lay
 I'd
 layer
 out
 all


these
 different
 types
 of
 goals.
 Like
 I


want
 to
 do
 these
 types
 of
 things.


Certain
 goals
 lead
 to
 other
 goals


because
 they're
 same
 type
 of
 fitness,


let's
 say.
 So
 like
 doing
 really
 big


things
 help
 you
 do
 even
 bigger
 things


later,
 but
 doing
 like
 really
 hard
 and


intense
 things
 help
 you
 do
 other
 hard


and
 intense
 things
 later,
 you
 know?
 So


in
 some
 ways
 in
 the
 way
 you
 stack
 your


goals,
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 build
 up
 to
 big


things
 or
 like
 build
 up
 to
 really
 hard


things
 or
 whatever.
 And
 so
 I've
 always


had
 running
 to-do
 lists
 of
 like
 I'm


going
 to
 try
 to
 do
 all
 these
 climbs
 this


year.
 And
 realistically,
 I
 normally
 do


like
 half
 of
 them
 or
 or
 some
 of
 them
 I


never
 even
 get
 to
 because
 it's
 like
 the


weather's
 not
 good.
 I
 wind
 up
 going
 to
 a


different
 area
 or
 I
 like
 don't
 go
 to


that
 that
 climbing
 destination
 at
 all.


And
 so
 I
 never
 even
 try
 the
 project.
 But


I've
 always
 had
 tons
 of
 goals
 like
 that.


And
 looking
 back
 at
 years
 and
 years
 of


that
 type
 of
 those
 types
 of
 lists,
 I


just
 see
 that
 it's
 slightly
 hard
 to


predict
 when
 you're
 going
 to
 achieve
 the


things
 that
 are
 like
 cutting
 edge
 or


groundbreaking
 or
 whatever.
 You
 just


have
 to
 keep
 doing
 the
 things
 non-stop


and
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 some
 of
 them


rise
 to
 the
 top.
 I
 mean,
 this
 kind
 of


goes
 back
 to
 the
 same
 like
 value


creating
 things
 like
 you
 don't
 know


which
 things
 are
 going
 to
 be
 rad.
 You


just
 do
 all
 the
 things
 and
 some
 of
 them


wind
 up
 being
 rad.


>> And
 the
 decision
 framework
 there
 is
 to


just
 do
 things
 you
 love
 and
 that


challenge
 you.


>> Yeah.
 things
 that
 push
 you
 in
 a
 like


things
 that
 are
 new
 for
 you
 that
 are


hard
 for
 you
 that
 are
 challenging
 in
 the


right
 ways,
 you
 know,
 but
 you
 just
 can't


you
 don't
 always
 know
 ahead
 of
 time


which
 of
 those
 things
 are
 going
 to
 stand


out
 or
 not,
 but
 you
 just
 do
 them
 anyway


because
 you're
 learning
 from
 them,


you're
 excited
 about
 them,
 they're
 hard


and
 then,
 you
 know,
 some
 are
 cool,
 some


aren't.
 Some
 you
 never
 even
 try
 and
 like


that's
 fine.
 You
 just
 keep
 doing
 things.


the
 CEO
 of
 Uber,
 Dario,
 was
 was
 sat


there
 yesterday
 and
 one
 of
 the
 um


contrarian
 pieces
 of
 life
 advice
 he


gave,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 overlaid
 with


what
 you
 just
 said,
 is
 he
 said
 people


need
 to
 stop
 making
 young
 people
 in


particular
 need
 to
 stop
 making
 life
 life


plans


>> because
 it
 narrows
 them
 to
 the


serendipity
 and
 opportunity
 and
 things


that
 might
 happen
 if
 they're
 broad
 and


openminded.


>> Well,
 or
 um
 uh
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 sometimes


joke
 it's
 that
 we
 both
 have
 very
 strong


opinions
 loosely
 held
 where
 it's
 like,


"Oh,
 I'm
 totally
 sure
 of
 a
 thing
 right


up
 until
 I
 get
 some
 data
 that
 shows
 that


that's
 wrong."
 And
 then
 you're
 like,


"Oh,
 never
 mind.
 throw
 that
 away.
 And


that's
 kind
 of
 how
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 to-do


lists
 have
 always
 been
 or
 like
 my
 goals


where
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 have
 all
 these


goals."
 But
 if
 I
 take
 a
 slight
 fork
 in


my
 year
 where
 it's
 like
 turns
 out,
 uh,


you
 know,
 for
 whatever
 reason,
 like


something
 else
 lines
 up
 and
 it
 makes


sense
 to
 do
 all
 these
 other
 things
 and


I'm
 just
 like
 right
 turn
 and
 just


change.


>> Mhm.


>> You
 know,


>> and
 it
 overlaps
 with
 what
 you
 said


earlier
 about
 like
 not
 worrying
 so
 much


about
 like
 how
 much
 it's
 going
 to
 pay
 me


today
 or
 what
 the
 big
 thing
 is
 or


>> it's
 kind
 of
 like
 just
 just
 keep
 doing


cool
 things.
 It'll
 it'll
 all
 work
 out.
 I


would
 love
 if
 we
 could,
 you
 know,
 scan


your
 brain
 and
 look
 at
 all
 the
 parts.


It's
 especially
 in
 the
 context
 I
 learned


of
 about
 this
 particular
 region
 of
 the


brain
 called
 the
 anterior
 mid-sulate


cortex.


>> Okay.


>> Which
 I
 heard
 Andrew
 Hman
 been
 talking


about.
 And
 it's
 a
 part
 of
 the
 brain
 they


discovered
 quite
 recently
 that
 lights
 up


when
 you
 do
 things
 that
 you
 don't
 want


to
 do.


>> So
 not
 things
 that
 you
 enjoy
 doing
 that


are
 somewhat
 like
 difficult
 like
 running


a
 marathon,
 but
 things
 that
 you
 actively


avoid
 and
 resist
 but
 do
 anyway.
 Pain,


fear,
 effort,
 discipline.
 This
 is
 the


circuit
 that
 decides
 whether
 you
 quit
 or


you
 push
 through.
 And
 it
 grows
 the
 more


you
 do
 things
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 do.
 So


it's
 like
 they
 now
 consider
 it
 to
 be
 the


muscle
 of
 willpower
 in
 the
 brain.
 When


they
 look
 at
 athletes,
 they
 have
 bigger


ones.
 When
 they
 look
 at
 people
 who
 are


>> struggling
 or
 less
 are
 more
 sedentary
 or


struggling
 with
 their
 weight,
 they
 often


have
 smaller
 ones.
 Anyone
 that
 avoids


discomfort
 has
 a
 smaller
 one.


>> So
 um


in
 your
 in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 way
 you've


lived
 your
 life,
 you've
 continued
 to
 do


things
 that
 are
 hard.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can


love
 climbing,
 but
 you
 don't
 necessarily


love


>> Yeah.
 But
 just
 doing
 like
 one
 more
 set


every
 time
 is
 like
 that's
 that's
 always


a
 challenge.
 You're
 always
 like
 my
 whole


body
 hurts
 but
 I'll
 just
 do
 a
 little


more,
 you
 know?


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 thing
 I
 guess
 here


is
 like
 about
 neuroplasticity
 which


there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 ton
 of
 people


listening
 right
 now
 that
 are
 so
 far
 away


from
 their
 type
 A


>> from
 their
 type
 A
 101.
 They're
 so
 far


away
 from
 that.
 They're
 in
 a
 job
 they


just
 don't
 like.
 They're
 maybe
 the


finance
 bra
 that
 you
 know
 you
 talked


about
 a
 second
 ago
 and
 their
 life
 is


absent
 of
 ad
 adventure
 and
 they
 probably


look
 at
 you
 and
 go
 well
 you
 know
 he
 just


has
 something
 I
 don't
 have.
 I
 know,
 but


I
 just
 don't,
 you
 know,
 I
 mean,
 I've


structured
 my
 life
 in
 a
 different
 way


and
 I've
 made
 many
 different
 choices
 and


and
 all
 that,
 but
 that's
 the
 thing
 is
 I


don't
 really
 think
 I
 have
 anything


different.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 actually
 hate
 all


the
 like
 brain
 stuff
 because
 people


always
 like
 use
 that
 to
 to
 put
 me
 in


this
 box
 of
 like,
 well,
 you're


different.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 well,
 not


really.
 Like,
 I'm
 a
 middle
 class


suburban
 kid.
 Both
 my
 parents
 like


nobody
 in
 my
 family
 is
 athletic.
 Like,


nobody
 is
 good
 at
 sports
 at
 all.
 You


know,
 it's
 like
 like
 basically
 if
 you


were
 to
 like
 look
 at
 the,
 you
 know,
 like


if
 I
 was
 a
 video
 game
 character
 and
 you


were
 to
 look
 at
 all
 my
 little
 bars,


you'd
 be
 like,
 "That
 guy's
 not
 going
 to


be
 an
 athlete.
 Like
 he's
 not
 good
 at


this."
 You
 know,
 it's
 like
 my
 parents


professors
 and
 we
 freaking
 read
 books.


Like
 I'm
 not
 there's
 no
 aptitude
 for


anything
 really.


>> And
 I
 was
 like
 bad
 at
 sports
 as
 a
 kid.


I'm
 not
 good
 with
 balls.
 Like,
 you
 know,


there's
 no
 reason.
 But
 I
 mean,
 really,
 I


just
 have
 loved
 climbing
 enough
 that


I've
 been
 willing
 to
 put
 in
 a
 tremendous


amount
 of
 time
 and
 effort
 and
 eventually


get
 good
 at
 it.
 And
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like
 to


hear
 people
 say
 like,
 "Oh,
 your
 brain's


different."
 You're
 kind
 of
 like,
 "Well,


everybody's
 brain
 is
 a
 little
 bit


different
 in
 some
 ways."
 It
 doesn't
 mean


that
 you
 can't
 devote
 yourself
 to


something
 that
 you
 care
 about.
 But
 with


this
 in
 mind,
 and
 with
 all
 the


neuroscientists
 that
 I've
 interviewed,


your
 brain
 is
 different
 in
 part
 because


you've
 taken
 you've
 done
 different


things.
 And
 neuroplasticity
 says
 you
 can


change
 your
 brain
 right
 the
 way
 up


throughout
 your
 your
 entire
 life.
 One
 of


my
 friends,
 um,
 Tom
 Bilu
 is
 a
 good


example
 of
 that.
 He's
 a
 big
 podcaster.


You
 might
 know
 Tom
 Bilu.
 Um,
 but
 he,
 you


know,
 he
 was,
 I
 can't
 remember
 the
 rough


age,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 he
 was
 30


years
 old.
 He
 was
 so,
 in
 his
 words,
 lazy


that
 he
 would
 lay
 in
 bed
 all
 day.
 When


his
 girlfriend
 came
 home,
 he
 said
 he


would
 jump
 up
 out
 of
 bed
 just
 so
 she


didn't
 believe
 that
 he
 was
 in
 bed
 all


day.
 And
 he
 didn't
 want
 to
 be


embarrassed.
 And
 when
 he
 asked
 his
 at


the
 time
 girlfriend
 if
 if
 he
 could
 um


asked
 her
 dad
 if
 he
 could
 marry
 her,
 dad


said
 no.
 He
 was
 he
 just
 he
 was
 like
 lazy


down
 and
 out.
 Over
 the
 next
 10
 years,
 he


makes
 decisions
 to
 take
 on
 more


difficult
 challenges,
 builds
 a
 billion


dollar
 company,
 sells
 it.
 If
 you
 meet


this
 guy
 today,
 you'd
 think
 like


athlete,
 genius,
 super
 smart,
 motivated.


You'd
 beg
 him
 for
 advice
 on
 discipline


and
 motivation.
 Like
 he's
 that
 kind
 of


guy.


>> What?
 Yeah.
 So,
 what
 did
 he
 do?


>> He
 read
 a
 book
 about
 neuroplasticity
 and


he
 realized
 that
 he
 wasn't
 stuck.


>> He
 he
 learned
 about
 neuroplasticity,


which
 means
 that
 at
 any
 age
 in
 your


life,
 the
 decisions
 you
 make
 change
 your


brain.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 love
 this


discovery
 of
 this
 anterior
 mid-syncular


cortex
 because
 it
 means
 that
 like
 maybe


in
 part
 the
 reason
 why
 I'm
 not
 taking
 on


my
 type
 A
 101
 is
 because
 I
 haven't
 taken


on
 my
 type
 A
 101.


>> Yeah.
 You
 have
 well
 you
 haven't
 taken
 on


uh
 your
 type
 A1.
 You
 know
 your
 type
 A


your
 type
 A
 12
 or
 whatever.
 you
 know,


like
 just
 the
 little
 pieces
 at
 the


bottom.
 Cuz
 that's
 the
 thing
 is
 like
 and


and
 actually
 this
 is
 why
 when
 you
 ask


about
 like
 any
 big
 goals,
 I'm
 like
 I
 I


sometimes
 I
 think
 the
 big
 goals
 are


slightly
 limiting
 because
 like
 if
 you're


your
 friend
 who's
 laying
 in
 bed,
 typo


101
 is
 not
 the
 appropriate
 goal.
 You


know
 what
 I
 mean?
 Like
 you
 need
 you
 need


to
 type
 a
 four.
 Like
 you
 need
 to
 just


get
 out
 and
 like
 do
 a
 little
 thing.
 You


need
 to
 achieve
 some
 success.
 you
 need


to
 see
 that
 you
 can
 do
 something
 and
 you


need
 to
 take
 on
 appropriately
 sized


challenges
 because
 I
 think
 having
 a


great
 white
 whale,
 you
 know,
 is
 is
 great


sometimes,
 but
 that's
 not
 always
 what


you
 need,
 you
 know,


>> and
 and
 partially
 like
 for
 me
 right
 now,


you
 know,
 we're
 raising
 two
 little
 kids


and
 we're
 just
 like
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 it,


you
 know,
 it's
 like
 bedtime
 right
 now
 is


hanging.
 It's
 just
 like
 it's
 a
 lot.
 And


I'm
 like,
 I
 don't
 need
 like
 an
 LC


capsized
 goal
 right
 now
 because,
 you


know,
 we're
 just
 trying
 to
 make
 it


through
 a
 certain
 phase
 of
 life
 really.


Not
 to
 say
 that
 I'll
 never
 have
 other


big
 goals,
 but
 you're
 kind
 of
 like
 you


you
 want
 your
 goals
 to
 be
 appropriate
 to


the
 the
 time
 and
 and
 and
 space
 that
 you


have
 available.


>> I
 had
 a
 psychologist
 say
 to
 me
 about


this
 idea
 of
 just
 setting
 yourself
 a


type
 A1,
 like
 a
 small
 goal.
 The
 reason


why
 people
 don't
 do
 it
 is
 because
 they


see
 it
 as
 almost
 so
 embarrassingly
 small


that
 they
 don't
 think
 it
 matters.


>> Yeah.
 But
 I
 mean,
 but
 that's
 why
 you


focus
 on
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 to
 you.
 Like


is
 it
 something
 that
 you
 haven't
 done?


Like
 is
 it
 good
 for
 your
 growth?
 Is
 it


challenging
 for
 you?
 like
 it's
 good


enough.


>> But
 that
 same
 psychologist
 told
 me
 that


when
 they
 were
 dealing
 with
 a
 patient


who
 was
 so
 demotivated
 um
 that
 they


couldn't
 get
 out
 of
 their
 bedroom
 which


was
 stacked
 to
 the
 ceiling
 with
 plates


and
 cutlery
 that
 day
 one
 was
 bringing


the
 Hoover
 into
 the
 room.
 That
 was
 day


one.
 Day
 two
 was
 plugging
 it
 in.
 That


was
 day
 two.
 And
 by
 day
 30
 they're


outside.
 This
 is
 someone
 who
 was
 scared


of
 going
 outside.
 They're
 outside


walking
 around.
 The
 room
 is
 clean.
 But


he
 he
 said
 to
 me
 that
 people
 don't
 take


that
 first
 step
 because
 it's
 so


embarrassingly
 small
 that
 it's
 almost


shameful
 to
 say
 like
 today
 we're
 just


going
 to
 bring
 the
 Hoover
 in.
 Yeah,
 but


that's
 the
 thing
 is
 it's
 always
 better


to
 take
 a
 step
 than
 to
 not
 take
 a
 step,


>> you
 know?
 That's
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 that's


how
 I've
 always
 felt
 with
 with
 all
 these


things.
 You're
 like,
 well,
 you
 might
 as


well
 go
 out
 and
 do
 the
 thing.
 Like,
 do


something.


You
 remember
 at
 the
 beginning
 I
 was


like,
 you
 don't
 let
 perfect
 be
 the
 enemy


of
 good.
 Like,
 you
 do
 the
 good
 thing,


you
 know,
 cuz
 it
 like
 it's
 like
 don't


let
 perfectionism
 [ __ ]
 you,
 you
 know?


It's
 like
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 you
 know


Taipe
 A
 101
 if
 that's
 kind
 of
 like
 your


perfect
 goal.
 It's
 like
 don't
 let
 that


hold
 you
 back
 from
 going
 out
 and


climbing
 Taipe
 A
 4
 or
 Type
 A
 or
 you
 know


like
 some
 of
 the
 surrounding
 little


buildings
 because
 it's
 like
 you
 practice


on
 what
 you
 can.
 Goes
 back
 to
 this
 point


of
 perseverance.
 I
 read
 a
 quote
 many


years
 ago
 that
 said
 um
 greatness
 doesn't


exist.
 Greatness
 is
 just
 good
 repeated.


>> I
 mean
 this
 is
 what
 I'm
 saying
 about


having
 lots
 of
 little
 goals
 is
 that
 I


would
 actually
 say
 that
 if
 you
 repeat


good
 enough
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 some


of
 those
 are
 great
 actually
 but
 you
 just


don't
 totally
 know.
 You
 know,
 I
 noticed


that
 a
 lot
 like
 in
 my
 climbing
 life,


like
 in
 the
 long
 arc
 of
 climbing,
 there


are
 tons
 of
 things
 I
 did
 in
 use
 where


like
 in
 a
 season
 I'd
 have
 like
 five
 or


six
 goals
 in
 use
 and
 I'd
 do
 all
 the


things
 and
 one
 of
 them
 for
 whatever


reason
 would
 wind
 up
 being
 like
 that's


rad
 and
 it
 would,
 you
 know,
 like
 makes


climbing
 news
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 And


the
 other
 ones,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 less
 so,


but
 you
 don't
 totally
 know
 ahead
 of
 time


which
 ones
 are
 cool
 or
 not
 and
 which


ones
 are
 going
 to
 stand
 the
 test
 of


time.


At
 one
 point
 in
 the
 not
 too
 distant


past,
 I
 held
 a
 speed
 record
 on
 every


major
 formation
 in
 use.
 Now
 a
 few
 of


them
 have
 been
 broken
 over
 time
 and
 but


those
 are
 the
 kinds
 of
 things
 where
 you


never
 really
 know
 like
 how
 long
 those


types
 of
 records
 will
 last
 cuz
 sometimes


you
 do
 them
 and
 then
 your
 friend
 comes


and
 breaks
 it
 the
 next
 season
 and
 you're


like
 cool
 and
 you
 go
 back
 and
 forth
 and


it's
 all
 part
 of
 a
 fun
 game
 and
 then


some
 of
 them
 you
 set
 a
 speed
 record
 and


it
 lasts
 for
 like
 15
 years
 and
 you're


sort
 of
 like
 oh
 I
 didn't
 realize
 that


this
 was
 going
 to
 be
 like
 such
 a


milestone.
 You
 know,


>> it
 reminds
 me
 of
 um
 the
 Steve
 Jobs
 quote


about
 how
 you
 can
 only
 really
 connect


the
 dots
 looking
 backwards
 in
 a


>> Totally.
 Totally.


>> Steve
 Jobs
 quote
 from
 his
 commencement


speech
 was,
 "You
 can't
 connect
 the
 dots


looking
 forward.
 You
 can
 only
 connect


them
 looking
 backwards."
 So,
 you
 have
 to


trust
 that
 the
 dots
 will
 somehow
 connect


in
 your
 future.
 Clarity
 isn't
 a


prerequisite
 for
 action.
 It's
 the
 reward


you
 get
 after
 you
 move.
 And
 that's


that's
 the
 thing
 I
 think
 cuz
 I
 do
 so


many
 interviews
 like,
 you
 know,
 when
 was


the
 moment
 you
 decided
 to
 be
 a


professional
 climber?
 And
 I'm
 like,


there's
 no
 moment.
 Like,
 I
 just
 did
 the


thing
 for
 years
 and
 years.
 And
 now


looking
 backward,
 it
 looks
 like
 this


amazing
 arc,
 you
 know,
 but
 at
 the
 moment


you're
 always,
 you
 know,
 I
 spent
 years


being
 like,
 should
 I
 go
 back
 to
 college?


Like,
 do
 I
 need
 a
 degree?
 Like,
 and
 then


I
 spent
 a
 few
 years
 wondering
 if
 I


should
 go
 back
 and
 get
 like
 an
 executive


MBA
 or
 something
 or
 something
 because
 I


was
 like,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to


undergrad.
 I've
 been
 living
 in
 my
 van


for
 10
 years.
 And
 but
 you're
 kind
 of


like
 still,
 I
 need
 that
 validation.
 I


need,
 you
 know,
 I
 want
 to
 jump
 through


the
 hoops.
 And
 then
 really,
 it's
 only


now
 that
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like,
 I
 don't
 think


I
 need
 that.
 In
 part,
 I
 think
 the
 reason


why
 we
 um
 we
 so
 many
 of
 us
 get
 forced


into
 procrastination
 when
 we're
 trying


to
 connect
 the
 dots
 looking
 forward
 is


because
 we
 face
 these
 questions
 from


society
 which
 is
 like
 what's
 your
 plan?


What's
 your
 career?
 What
 are
 you
 aiming


at?
 And
 we
 don't
 have
 answers.
 So,
 we


fill
 in
 the
 gaps.
 We
 have
 to
 say


something
 to
 mom
 and
 dad.
 You
 have
 to


say
 like
 what's
 the
 plan
 for
 the
 future?


You
 can't
 say
 nothing.
 No
 plan.


>> Well,
 or
 you
 just
 say,
 "I'm
 living.
 I'm


just
 letting
 it
 play
 out.
 We'll
 just
 see


see
 what
 happens.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a


grand
 adventure."
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,


I
 kind
 of
 hope
 my
 my
 kids
 feel
 confident


with
 that,
 you
 know,
 just
 kind
 of
 like,


"Well,
 I'm
 doing
 the
 best
 I
 can.
 and
 I'm


practicing
 the
 things
 that
 I
 care
 about


and
 we'll
 see
 how
 it
 plays
 out.


>> We'll
 see
 how
 it
 plays
 out
 cuz
 like


either
 way
 it's
 going
 to
 play
 out
 with


with
 me
 and
 them
 and
 everybody
 else


dying.
 You're
 like,
 you
 know
 how
 it's


going
 to
 play
 out
 at
 the
 end
 end.
 And
 so


you're
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 whole
 space
 up


to
 there
 is
 like,
 oh,
 you
 just
 try
 to


fill
 it
 with
 as
 many
 things
 that
 you're


proud
 of
 as
 you
 can.


>> It's
 a
 remarkably
 simple
 way
 to
 live
 in


a
 world
 that's
 increasingly
 complex,


Alex.
 Hm.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 it
 doesn't
 need


to
 be
 that
 complex,


but
 this
 is
 why
 I
 think
 spending
 some


time
 in
 nature
 like
 helps
 remind
 you
 of


some
 of
 those
 sorts
 of
 things.
 This


company
 that
 I've
 just
 invested
 in,
 it's


grown
 like
 crazy.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 the
 one


to
 tell
 you
 about
 it
 because
 I
 think


it's
 going
 to
 create
 such
 a
 huge


productivity
 advantage
 for
 you.
 Whisper


Flow
 is
 an
 app
 that
 you
 can
 get
 on
 your


computer
 and
 on
 your
 phone,
 on
 all
 your


devices,
 and
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 speak
 to


your
 technology.
 So,
 instead
 of
 me


writing
 out
 an
 email,
 I
 click
 one
 button


on
 my
 phone
 and
 I
 can
 just
 speak
 the


email
 into
 existence
 and
 it
 uses
 AI
 to


clean
 up
 what
 I
 was
 saying.
 And
 then


when
 I'm
 done,
 I
 just
 hit
 this
 one


button
 here
 and
 the
 whole
 email
 is


written
 for
 me.
 And
 it's
 saving
 me
 so


much
 time
 in
 a
 day
 because
 Whisper


learns
 how
 I
 write.
 So
 on
 WhatsApp,
 it


knows
 how
 I
 am
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 casual.


On
 email,
 a
 little
 bit
 more


professional.
 And
 also,
 there's
 this


really
 interesting
 thing
 they've
 just


done.
 I
 can
 create
 little
 phrases
 to


automatically
 do
 the
 work
 for
 me.
 I
 can


just
 say
 Jack's
 LinkedIn
 and
 it
 copies


Jack's
 LinkedIn
 profile
 for
 me
 because


it
 knows
 who
 Jack
 is
 in
 my
 life.
 This
 is


saving
 me
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 time.
 This


company
 is
 growing
 like
 absolute
 crazy.


And
 this
 is
 why
 I
 invested
 in
 the


business
 and
 why
 they're
 now
 a
 sponsor


of
 this
 show.
 And
 Whisper
 Flow
 is


frankly
 becoming
 the
 worstkept
 secret
 in


business,
 productivity,
 and


entrepreneurship.
 Check
 it
 out

Steven.
 It
 will
 be
 a
 game
 changer
 for


you.
 If
 you
 knew
 that
 you
 only
 had
 one


week
 left
 to
 live
 and
 this
 was
 the
 week


and
 you
 could
 only
 do
 one
 last
 climb,


you
 go
 back
 and
 recapture
 the
 record,
 go


do
 our
 cap
 again,
 I
 don't
 know,
 a


different
 building,
 you
 have
 one
 week


and
 assume
 you're
 sufficiently
 prepared


for
 whatever
 the
 climb
 would
 be.
 What


would
 what
 would


>> So
 I'm
 allowed
 to
 do
 like
 cutting
 edge


futuristic
 things.


>> Yeah.


>> Oh,
 well
 then
 I'm
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


mean
 the
 Burrish
 like
 it'd
 be
 insane.


But
 um
 but
 no
 uh
 like
 the
 the
 free


triple
 in
 Euseite
 is
 like
 the
 three


biggest
 walls
 in
 Euseite.
 Uh


>> free
 triple


>> the
 so
 it's
 LCAP,
 Halfdme,
 and
 Mount


Watkins.
 Mount
 Watkins
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 a


halfdome
 sized
 wall
 that's
 further
 up


valley.
 So
 it
 was
 the
 three
 biggest


walls
 in
 Euseite.
 So
 Tommy
 Caldwell
 and


I
 have
 free
 climbed
 the
 triple.
 The
 two


of
 us
 did
 it
 together
 with
 ropes,
 but
 we


like
 climbed
 the
 whole
 thing.
 And
 then


I've
 soloed
 the
 triple.
 So
 I've
 done
 all


three
 with
 ropes
 by
 myself.
 It
 was
 like


18
 or
 19
 hours
 or
 something
 of
 climbing.


Um,
 but
 it's
 never
 been
 free
 sololed.


Uh,
 I've
 freestolled
 Haft
 individually


and
 I've
 free
 sololed
 Alcap


individually.
 No
 one's
 ever
 free
 soloed


Watkins.
 But
 the
 idea
 of
 doing
 all
 three


in
 a
 day
 would
 be
 like
 I
 think
 totally


like
 next
 generation
 achievement.
 There


are
 certain
 things
 like
 that
 where
 I'm


sort
 of
 like
 if
 I
 was
 starting
 over,
 if


I
 was
 like
 an
 18-year-old
 who
 was
 like


trying
 to
 make
 it
 as
 a
 professional


climber
 nowadays
 and
 had
 a
 higher
 level


of
 skill
 than
 I
 do
 now
 and,
 you
 know,


basically
 was
 like
 trying
 to
 do
 this


again.
 There
 things
 like
 that
 that
 would


be
 sort
 of
 like
 the
 obvious
 next


generation
 challenge.
 free
 solo,
 all


three
 in
 the
 same
 day.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I'd
 probably
 take
 uh
 well,


it
 take
 a
 bit
 under
 24
 hours
 probably.


>> What
 is
 your
 training
 regimen
 to
 these


days?
 Is
 it
 go
 rock
 climbing
 a
 lot


today?
 I
 did
 a
 little
 workout
 in
 the


hotel
 gym
 this
 morning.


>> Your
 hands
 are
 quite
 different.
 I
 was


They're
 quite
 big
 hands.


>> Well,
 that's
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 I
 think


like
 a
 stonemason
 just
 like
 grinding


away
 their
 whole
 life.
 I
 see
 you.
 You


have
 I
 don't
 know if
 people
 can
 see
 that


on
 camera,
 but
 you
 it
 does
 look
 like
 you


have
 very
 um


wide
 fingers.


>> Yeah,
 my
 fingers
 uh
 have
 taken
 a
 lot
 of


abuse
 in
 their
 time


>> cuz
 I
 see
 you
 like
 putting
 them
 in
 in


between
 walls.


>> Yeah,
 crack
 climbing.
 It's
 like
 you


basically
 put
 your
 fingers
 into
 a
 crack


and
 then
 you
 torque
 them.
 And
 so
 like


the
 side
 to
 side
 pulling
 uh
 does
 sort
 of


make
 your
 connective
 tissue
 bigger.


>> And
 does
 that
 hurt?


>> Yeah,
 it
 hurts.


>> It
 I
 was
 wondering
 when
 you're
 going


uphel
 when
 you're
 doing
 it
 well
 with


good
 technique,
 it
 it's
 not
 that


painful.
 Well,
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 type
 of


rock,
 but
 some
 rock
 is
 kind
 of
 sharp
 and


kind
 of
 painful.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 this
 is


this
 goes
 back
 to
 strengthening
 your


what's
 the
 part
 called
 in
 your
 brain?


>> Anterior
 midsular
 cortex.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 That
 guy.
 I
 mean,
 that's


the
 thing
 is
 that
 even
 when
 done
 well,


climbing
 like
 it
 hurts
 your
 fingers
 and


toes,
 you
 know,
 crack
 climbing
 when


you're
 like
 jamming
 your
 toes
 into
 a


crack
 and
 you're
 torquing
 them
 side
 to


side
 and
 you're
 like
 wedging
 your


fingers
 in.
 I
 mean,
 when
 you're
 doing
 it


well,
 it
 has
 a
 pleasant
 feel
 of
 safety


to
 it
 cuz
 you
 can
 really
 like
 lock
 into


cracks
 and
 it
 feels
 comfortable
 and
 you


feel
 like
 you're
 swimming
 and
 you're


like,
 "This
 is
 beautiful."
 But
 when
 you


really
 come
 down
 to
 the
 sensations,


you're
 still
 crushing
 your
 bones
 into
 a


crack
 like
 a
 Star
 Wars.


>> When
 I
 look
 at
 this
 kind
 of
 photo


>> where
 you're
 It
 looks
 like
 you're


hanging
 by
 one
 and
 a
 half
 hands.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you're
 going to
 fall
 to
 your
 death


if
 you
 if
 your
 grip
 isn't


>> sufficient.
 It
 makes
 me
 think
 you
 must


have
 the
 world's
 greatest
 grip
 strength.


>> Uh
 I
 definitely
 don't.


>> I
 mean,
 well,
 you
 have
 your
 your
 grip


then.
 You
 can
 find
 out


>> what's
 below
 you
 there
 in
 this
 photo.


Well,
 actually,
 so
 there
 is
 like
 a


sloping
 cliff
 thing
 below
 me.
 Uh,
 so
 I'm


actually
 only
 like
 30
 ft
 off
 the
 ground,


but
 if
 or
 40
 ft,
 but
 if
 you
 fell,
 you'd


bounce
 off
 and
 you'd
 go,
 you
 know,


basically
 to
 where
 it
 looks
 like
 down
 in


the
 valley
 floor
 down
 there.


>> Terrifying
 photo.


>> It's
 funny,
 actually.
 Have
 you
 you


you've
 seen
 Free
 Solo?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Do
 you
 remember
 the
 the
 camera
 guy
 that


like
 can't
 look?
 Uh,
 the
 guy
 that's
 like


shooting
 the
 long
 shot
 on
 the
 ground,


Mikey.
 He's
 a
 really
 good
 friend
 of


mine.
 I've
 done
 tons
 of
 things
 with
 him.


He
 was
 he
 shot
 the
 Taipei
 clown
 as
 well.


Um,
 Mikey
 was
 the
 photo
 assistant
 for


this
 photo.
 He
 was
 like
 holding
 the


photos
 and
 he
 did
 the
 whole
 shoot
 just


like


>> looking
 into
 the
 wall.
 Like
 he
 just


never
 looked
 at
 any
 of
 the
 things


happening.
 Like
 Jimmy
 Chin
 was
 taking


the
 photo
 and
 Mikey
 was
 like
 did
 all
 the


the
 rigging
 and
 the
 lights
 and


everything
 and
 Mikey
 did
 the
 whole
 shoot


just
 like
 looking
 into
 his
 armpit
 like


looking
 the
 other
 way.
 He
 was
 like
 I
 am


not
 part
 of
 this.


>> I
 would
 like
 to
 see
 his
 brain
 scan.


>> He
 was
 stressed
 but
 he
 I
 mean
 he's
 an


elite
 climber
 himself
 and
 he's
 he's


amazing
 but
 like
 basically
 watching
 free


souling
 is
 stressful
 and
 nobody
 wants
 to


do
 it
 if
 they
 don't
 have
 to.
 When
 is
 in


all
 your
 career,
 when
 is
 the
 moment


where
 you
 were
 most
 scared?
 Where
 you


thought
 maybe
 you
 had
 pushed
 it
 too
 far?


>> Oh,
 it's
 actually
 uh
 I've
 had
 several


moments,
 but
 it's
 actually
 mostly
 with


ropes
 on.
 That's
 the
 thing
 is
 that


because
 when
 you're
 freestyling,
 you


generally
 keep
 it
 within
 a
 healthy


margin
 or
 you
 practice
 ahead
 of
 time,


you
 know,
 basically
 because
 you're
 going


to
 die.
 You
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 can
 do


it.
 But
 when
 you
 have
 a
 rope
 on,
 you're


way
 more
 willing
 to
 push
 into
 the


unknown
 because
 you're
 kind
 of
 like,


surely
 I'll
 get
 some
 protection


eventually.
 I'll
 just
 keep
 looking.
 I'll


keep
 looking.
 And
 so
 like
 I've
 had
 I
 was


on
 an
 expedition
 to
 Antarctica
 actually


um
 in
 2017
 and
 did
 a
 bunch
 of
 climbing


that
 was
 very
 extreme
 but
 like
 with
 a


rope
 but
 it
 was
 you
 know
 it's
 Antarctica


it's
 really
 freaking
 cold
 conditions
 are


challenging
 the
 rock
 is
 crumbling


everything
 is
 scary
 and
 you
 just
 keep


hoping
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 get
 better
 and


it
 just
 keeps
 getting
 worse
 instead
 and


eventually
 you're
 sort
 of
 like
 because


the
 thing
 is
 having
 a
 rope
 on
 doesn't


mean
 anything
 unless
 you
 get
 good


protection
 which
 means
 you
 have
 to
 be


able
 to
 put
 gear
 into
 the
 rock
 and
 if


you
 can't
 find
 places
 to
 put
 gear
 into


the
 rock
 then
 you
 can
 go
 you
 know
 the


rope
 is
 200
 feet
 If
 you
 go
 200
 feet


without
 getting
 good
 gear,
 then
 you're


looking
 at
 taking
 a
 400t
 fall
 before
 the


rope
 catches
 you.
 Uh,
 which
 is
 almost


certainly
 fatal,
 you
 know.
 I
 mean,
 if


you
 fall
 that
 far,
 even
 though
 the
 rope


will
 catch
 your
 corpse,
 you
 know,
 but


you're
 still
 just
 going
 to
 hit
 the
 wall


after
 400
 ft,
 like
 you're
 screwed.
 So,


anyway,
 my
 scariest
 experiences
 have
 all


been
 situations
 like
 that
 for
 the
 most


part.
 This
 is
 why
 I'm
 saying
 climbing,


you
 get
 scared
 a
 lot.


And
 our
 like
 that
 expedition
 we
 were


climbing
 basically
 day
 on,
 day
 off.
 Each


day
 we
 would
 go
 climb
 one
 of
 these
 crazy


spires
 and
 we'd
 have
 these
 experiences


where
 I'd
 be
 like
 so
 scared
 and
 then
 the


next
 day
 we
 would
 just
 sit
 in
 the
 tent


because
 it's
 Antarctica.
 It's
 like


really
 cold.
 You're
 in
 the
 cook
 tent
 and


I
 would
 basically
 just
 spoon
 Nutella
 all


day
 totally
 shell
 shocked
 like
 totally


like
 just
 completely
 traumatized
 and


then
 the
 and
 then
 you'd
 be
 like
 rested


enough
 and
 you
 go
 out
 the
 next
 day
 and


do
 it
 again
 and
 we
 just
 did
 like
 day
 on


day
 off
 of
 like
 full
 trauma
 fear
 for
 the


whole
 trip
 and
 then
 we
 climbed


everything
 in
 the
 range.
 It
 was
 amazing.


It
 was
 an
 incredible
 trip.


>> So
 you
 do
 get
 scared?


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 so
 scared
 the
 whole
 time.


Are
 there
 any
 techniques
 that
 are
 proven


to
 be
 effective
 for
 you
 to
 deal
 with


that
 fear?
 Like
 people
 talk
 about
 breath


work
 and


>> yeah,
 take
 some
 deep
 breaths,
 try
 to


compose
 yourself.
 I
 mean,
 I
 try
 to
 stay


rational,
 you
 know,
 like,
 am
 I
 in


danger?
 Cuz
 sometimes,
 like
 in
 this
 case


in
 Antarctica,
 I
 am
 actually
 in
 danger.


Like,
 if
 I
 fall,
 I
 could
 die.
 Um,
 but


often
 times
 you
 feel
 you
 get
 those


feelings
 of
 fear
 and
 you're
 not
 actually


in
 danger.
 You
 just
 it's
 your
 mind


running
 away
 from
 you.
 And
 so
 sometimes


you
 can
 sort
 of
 rationally
 re
 in
 a


little
 bit
 where
 you're
 like,
 "No,
 I
 am


safe.
 The
 protection
 will
 hold
 me.
 The


rope
 is,
 you
 know,
 my
 gear
 is
 good."
 And


then
 you
 just
 take
 a
 deep
 breath
 and
 you


just
 carry
 on.


>> And
 do
 you
 visualize
 falling
 ever?


>> Oh
 yeah.
 I
 mean
 of
 course.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean


you
 have
 to
 understand
 what
 the


consequences
 will
 be
 because
 I
 mean
 that


type
 of
 visualization
 is
 also
 how
 you


can
 know
 when
 you're
 safe
 because
 like


if
 you
 ever
 open
 gear
 and
 you're
 trying


to
 visualize
 like
 if
 I
 fall
 am
 I
 going


to
 hit
 the
 ground
 or
 is
 the
 gear
 going


to
 catch
 me
 before
 I
 hit
 the
 ground?
 I


mean
 there
 often
 situations
 like
 that


where
 you're
 like
 if
 I
 fall
 am
 I
 going


to
 hit
 that
 ledge
 and
 break
 both
 my
 legs


or
 am
 I
 going
 to
 clear
 the
 ledge
 and


fall
 into
 free
 space
 in
 which
 case
 it's


totally
 safe.
 And
 so
 it
 helps
 to
 be
 able


to
 have
 a
 cleareyed
 visualization
 of,


you
 know,
 because
 most
 people
 visualize


the
 worst
 case,
 like
 if
 I
 fall,
 I'm


going
 to
 die.
 And
 you're
 like,
 well,


often
 times
 if
 you
 I'm
 talking
 about


with
 the
 rope,
 if
 you
 fall,
 you're
 going


to
 be
 fine.
 But
 it's
 important
 to
 know


the
 difference.


>> So
 you
 don't
 avoid
 the
 confrontation


with
 the
 negative
 outcomes.


>> No,
 because
 you're
 trying
 to
 avoid
 the


negative
 out
 like
 you
 have
 to
 think


about
 it
 because
 how
 else
 do
 you


mitigate
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff,


>> but
 you
 can't
 let
 that
 stop
 you
 taking


actions
 when
 the
 risk
 profile
 is
 okay.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 like
 a


whole
 rant
 about
 risk-taking
 and


everything,
 but
 like
 I
 mean,
 that's
 the


thing
 is
 you
 want
 to
 be
 taking
 the
 risks


that
 you
 want
 to
 take.
 And
 it
 drives
 me


crazy
 that
 nobody
 else
 thinks
 about
 risk


in
 this
 way
 because
 think
 of
 all
 the


people
 that
 like
 go
 out
 partying
 every


weekend
 and
 they
 get
 like
 kind
 of
 buzzed


and
 they
 drive
 home
 and
 whatever.
 And


it's
 like
 they're
 taking
 all
 kinds
 of


risk
 that
 they're
 not
 actually
 choosing


to
 take.
 You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 Like


they're
 just
 choosing
 to
 go
 out
 and


party
 and
 have
 a
 good
 time,
 but
 then


they're
 like
 driving
 a
 little
 buzzed
 and


they're
 like,
 "No,
 it's
 fine."
 But


you're
 like, "No,
 obviously
 you're


taking
 a
 risk."
 or
 like
 you're
 putting


yourself
 into
 situations
 where
 you're


like
 in
 a
 vulnerable
 situation
 because


you're
 incapacitated
 because
 you're


drunk
 or
 whatever.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,


you're
 putting
 yourself
 at
 higher
 risk


for
 crime,
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 so,


you're
 taking
 risks,
 you
 just
 haven't


chosen
 to
 take
 those
 risks.
 I'm
 kind
 of


like,
 the
 thing
 with
 climbing
 is
 that


I'm
 choosing
 to
 take
 the
 risks.
 And
 I'm


pretty
 cleareyed
 about
 the
 risk
 that
 I'm


taking.
 Like,
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 going to


say
 it's
 perfect,
 but
 for
 the
 most
 part,


I
 think
 I
 have
 a
 pretty
 good
 idea
 of


which
 aspects
 are
 dangerous,
 like
 when


the
 consequences
 are
 high,
 what
 will


happen
 if
 I
 do
 fall.
 You
 know,
 it's
 like


you
 try
 to
 think
 it
 all
 out
 as
 much
 as


you
 can.
 And
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like,
 how
 many


people
 in
 normal
 life
 actually
 think


through
 all
 the
 risks
 that
 they're


taking?
 And
 even
 totally
 sedentary


people
 who
 are
 like,
 "Well,
 I
 don't
 take


risk.
 I
 stay
 home
 and
 I
 play
 video


games."
 You're
 like,
 "No,
 you're
 at
 a


much
 higher
 risk
 of
 heart
 disease.
 Like,


you're
 going to
 die
 from
 other
 things."


You
 know,
 it's
 like,
 and
 you're
 still


going
 to
 freaking
 die
 either
 way.
 That's


okay.
 I'm
 done
 ranting.
 I'm
 sorry.


>> No,
 no,
 but
 it's
 really
 important


because
 you
 I
 think
 we
 are
 all
 taking


risks,
 but
 some
 of
 us
 aren't
 intentional


about
 the
 risks
 we're
 taking


essentially.


>> Well,
 that's
 exactly
 it.
 Like,
 even
 if


you
 take
 no
 risk,
 you're
 going
 to
 die.


you're
 taking
 a
 different
 set
 of
 risks.


And
 so
 people
 look
 at
 my
 life
 and


they're
 like,
 "Well,
 you're
 crazy.


You're
 such
 a
 risk
 taker."
 And
 I'm
 kind


of
 like,
 "Well,
 at least
 I'm
 taking
 the


risks
 that
 I'm
 choosing
 and
 I'm
 choosing


them
 very
 intentionally
 and
 I'm
 pretty


careful
 about
 them
 and
 I
 mitigate
 them


as
 much
 as
 I
 can."
 I'm
 kind
 of
 like,


"Well,
 can
 you
 say
 the
 same
 for
 the
 risk


that
 you're
 taking
 or,
 you
 know,
 I'm


sort
 of
 like
 the
 average
 person,
 I


think,
 doesn't
 think
 about
 risk
 as
 much


as
 they
 should."


>> And
 is
 there
 anything
 that
 you
 would


give
 them
 as
 a
 framework
 to
 help
 them
 be


more
 intentional
 about
 those
 risks?
 Is


there
 is
 it
 just


>> Well,
 it's
 like
 you're
 going
 to
 freaking


die
 either
 way,
 so
 choose
 the
 things


that
 you
 care
 about
 and
 then
 do
 them


well.


and
 do
 them
 well.
 Prepare.


>> Yeah.
 Execute.
 Like
 have
 a
 plan,
 you


know,
 but
 don't
 just
 like
 take
 risk


willy-nilly.
 Like
 don't
 just
 get
 drunk


and
 go
 out
 and
 do
 a
 thing,
 you
 know,
 cuz


like
 that's
 stupid.
 Like
 that's
 not
 the


risk
 you
 should
 be
 taking,
 you
 know?


Like
 don't
 put
 all
 your
 money
 on
 black


and
 just
 like
 hope,
 you
 know what
 I


mean?
 Like
 basically
 don't
 just
 like


roll
 the
 dice.
 Like
 don't
 let
 fate
 just


like
 roll
 the
 roll
 the
 dice
 with
 your


life.
 Like
 make
 choices.


>> And
 free
 soloing
 is,
 you
 know,
 there's
 a


bigger
 existential
 risk
 with
 no
 margin


for
 error.
 But
 um


>> but
 it's
 very
 intentional.


>> Very
 intentional.
 Drinking
 as
 as
 a
 risk


is
 like
 a
 volume
 knob.
 The
 more
 you
 do


it,
 the
 more
 the
 risk
 increases.


>> And
 the
 other
 one
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 an


on-off
 switch,
 which
 you
 can
 you
 do
 it


today.
 And


>> yeah.
 So
 grip
 strength.


>> I
 wouldn't
 be
 even
 a
 little
 bit


surprised
 if
 you
 can
 pull
 that
 more
 than


I
 can
 actually,
 but
 I
 mean
 we'll
 both


try.


>> Okay.
 This
 is
 a
 grip
 strength
 meter.


>> Um
 okay,
 so
 let's
 see.
 We're
 at
 zero.
 Um


kilograms
 would
 be
 extra
 small
 then.
 Uh,


I
 mean,
 the
 thing
 with
 these
 like,
 okay,


actually,
 let
 me
 just
 preface
 this
 with


like
 I've
 had
 tons
 of
 people
 be
 like,


"Well,
 surely
 you're
 going
 to
 break
 the


machine."
 I'm
 like,
 "No,
 because
 for


climbing,
 you
 you
 just
 have
 the
 strength


that
 you
 need
 to
 do
 the
 things
 that


you're
 trying
 to
 do."


>> And
 how
 much
 do
 you
 weigh?


>> Um,
 right
 now
 like
 165.


>> 165,


>> which
 is
 actually
 basically
 the
 heaviest


I've
 ever
 been.
 Maybe
 163
 if
 I'm
 lucky


right
 now.


>> So,
 165
 lbs
 in
 kg
 is
 equivocal
 to
 75
 kg


roughly.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 Go
 ahead.


49
 or
 50
 49.9


more.
 It's
 just
 like


Yeah,
 49.
 You
 know,


>> those
 are
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 it's
 just
 a


it's
 just
 a
 different
 thing.
 You
 know


what
 I
 mean?
 Like
 that's
 not
 climbing.


>> 49
 kg
 in
 pounds
 is


108.
 Interesting.


>> Yeah,
 let's
 see
 yours
 though.
 But
 yeah,


like
 I
 said,


>> different
 arms.


>> Uh
 it's
 about
 the
 same
 with
 both
 hands.


It
 should
 be


>> 62.


>> Yeah.
 See,
 there
 you
 go.


>> I
 can't
 lift
 my
 body
 weight.
 Like


>> I
 might
 be
 able
 to
 like
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I


might
 be
 able
 to
 muster
 a
 little
 more
 in


it,
 but


>> 63
 on
 that
 one.


>> Let
 me
 try
 again.


>> But
 like
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 uh
 Do
 you


work
 out?
 Like
 you
 do
 weights
 and
 stuff?


I


>> I
 lift
 dumbbells,
 but
 I'm
 not
 doing


anything
 grippy.
 I
 curl
 and
 stuff,
 but
 I


don't
 do
 anything
 grippy.


>> I
 know.
 I'm
 at
 50
 and
 a
 half.


>> How
 many
 pull-ups
 can
 you
 do?


>> Don't
 know.
 But
 I
 can.
 Yesterday
 I
 did


uh
 I
 did
 a
 couple
 one-
 arms
 like
 uh
 like


Yeah,
 I
 basically
 pull-ups.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Which
 is
 very
 hard.


>> Yeah.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 can
 do
 one
 arms.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 that's
 the
 thing.
 That's
 why


grip
 strength
 stuff
 you're
 kind
 of
 like


nah.
 Or
 actually,
 so
 um
 like
 have
 you


done
 weighted
 pull-ups
 in
 a
 gym?


>> Weighted
 pull-ups?
 No,
 I
 just
 do
 I'll


just
 do
 my
 own
 body
 weight
 and
 I
 you


know
 I
 weigh
 a
 lot.
 So
 I'm
 like


deceptively
 heavy.


>> Really?
 Like


>> very
 dense?


>> Very
 dense.
 Cloat
 in
 water.
 No,
 like
 big


bones.


>> You
 just
 sink
 straight
 in
 the
 bottom.


How
 how
 much
 kilograms
 do
 you
 think
 I


weigh?
 I
 mean,
 in
 pounds,
 you'd
 know
 it.


But
 this
 is


>> Well,
 now
 I'm
 now
 I'm
 guessing.
 I
 don't


know.
 Like,
 now
 that
 you're
 saying
 that


you're
 big,
 I'm
 like
 I
 don't know,
 maybe


185
 or
 something.
 What?


>> I'm
 211.


>> Yeah.
 With
 actually
 So,
 that's
 another


thing
 with
 grip
 strength
 is
 like
 it


makes
 sense
 that
 your
 grip
 strength
 is


proportionally.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 like
 25%


bigger
 than
 me.


>> Yeah.


>> Like,
 you
 know,
 basically.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 it's
 like
 you
 would
 expect
 it
 to
 at


least
 25%
 stronger
 right
 there
 just


because
 like
 if
 you
 can
 do
 body


weightight
 pull-ups,
 you're
 going
 to
 be


much
 stronger.


>> Yeah.
 Right.


>> We
 have
 um
 we
 have
 a
 closing
 tradition


on
 this
 podcast
 where
 the
 last
 guest


leaves
 a
 question
 for
 the
 next
 guest
 not


knowing
 who
 they're
 leaving
 it
 for.


>> And
 the
 question
 left
 for
 you
 is
 oh


what
 do
 you
 want
 to
 achieve
 in
 your
 life


outside
 of
 your
 mainline
 job
 that
 you


haven't
 yet
 achieved?


I
 don't know.
 I
 mean
 that
 seems
 there


basically
 two
 other
 avenues
 that
 I
 care


about
 in
 my
 life.
 Uh
 you
 know
 my
 family.


I
 want
 to
 be
 a
 good
 dad.
 I
 want
 to
 make


sure
 my
 kids
 grow
 up
 to
 be
 healthy,


welladjusted
 people
 that,
 you
 know,
 like


live
 their
 best
 lives.
 And
 then
 I
 have
 a


foundation
 that
 supports
 community
 solar


projects
 around
 the
 world.
 And
 I'd
 love


to
 see
 that
 thrive.
 I
 mean,
 basically,
 I


mean,
 you
 know,
 we
 give
 as
 much
 as
 we


can
 to
 to
 solar
 projects
 around
 the


world.
 And
 I'd
 love
 to
 see
 that
 do
 more.


>> On
 that
 point
 of
 your
 foundation,
 what


is
 what
 is
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 thesis
 there?


You
 want
 to
 for
 solar
 projects?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Solar
 it's
 basically
 energy


access
 around
 the
 world.


>> Okay.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 now
 we've
 given
 I
 don't


know
 over
 13
 million
 to
 something
 like


over
 100
 partners
 around
 the
 world.


Basically
 like
 small
 scale
 community


solar
 projects.
 So
 people
 getting
 access


to
 energy
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 Um


basically
 using
 solar
 for
 anything


ranging
 from
 light
 to
 you
 know
 say
 food


refrigeration
 to
 pumping
 water.
 I
 mean


whatever
 whatever
 people
 need
 energy
 for


which
 is
 basically
 everything.


13
 more
 than
 13
 million
 across
 130


projects
 in
 30
 countries
 impacting


650,000
 people
 and
 creating
 1,200
 plus


jobs
 protected
 15
 million
 acres
 of


biodiverse
 forest
 as
 well.
 Yeah,
 some
 of


those
 things
 are
 sort
 of
 like
 the
 the


secondary
 and
 tertiary
 benefits
 where


it's
 like
 when
 you
 empower
 certain
 kinds


of
 communities
 then
 they're
 better
 able


to
 take
 care
 of
 their
 lands
 and
 things


like
 that.
 Some
 of
 that
 has
 to
 do
 with


indigenous
 sovereignty
 and
 things
 like


in
 the
 Ecuadorian
 Amazon
 and
 and
 places


where
 it's
 like
 when
 the
 local
 people


have
 power
 suddenly
 they
 can
 protect


their
 land
 from
 illegal
 logging,
 illegal


mining,
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 so
 then


you
 wind
 up
 having
 this
 knockoff
 like


environmental
 benefit
 that's
 like
 also


great
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 human
 aspect


where
 you're
 like,
 well,
 these
 people


are
 living
 better
 lives
 and
 it
 helps


save
 the
 planet.


>> And
 you're
 giving
 away
 roughly
 a
 third


of
 your
 wealth
 to
 cover
 the
 majority
 of


the
 foundation's
 overheads.
 So
 yeah,


I've
 been
 given
 roughly
 a
 third
 of
 my
 of


what
 I
 make
 every
 year
 uh
 since
 2012.


And
 uh
 that's
 basically
 just
 sort
 of


coincidentally
 tracked
 with
 the
 overhead


for
 the
 foundation.
 So
 it
 just
 means


that
 anything
 that
 people
 contribute


goes
 straight
 to
 projects
 because
 I


basically
 cover
 all
 the
 staffing
 and


everything.
 And


>> how
 does
 how
 does
 one
 contribute
 to


that?


>> Uh
 honoundation.org
 is
 the
 easiest
 way


you
 can
 support
 directly.
 I
 mean
 you
 can


see
 all
 the
 projects
 that
 we're
 working


with


>> and
 donors
 can
 go
 there
 if
 they
 want
 to


contribute
 to
 this.
 So
 they
 can
 go
 to


the
 website.
 Okay.
 Well,
 I'll
 link
 the


website
 below
 and
 if
 anyone
 is


interested
 in
 continuing
 to
 support
 the


great
 work
 you're
 doing
 there.
 Um
 I'd


highly
 recommend
 they
 go
 and
 make
 a


donation.
 It's
 a
 it's
 also
 just
 a
 way
 I


think
 to
 give
 back
 to
 you
 as
 a
 person


for
 the
 inspiration
 you've
 given
 so
 many


of
 us.


>> I
 appreciate
 that,


>> you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 to
 me
 the
 foundation
 has


always
 been
 my
 attempt
 at
 doing


something
 useful
 cuz
 like
 I
 love
 rock


climbing.
 I
 think
 it's
 so
 fun.
 But
 in


the
 grand
 scheme
 of
 things
 it
 doesn't


really
 matter
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 I
 feel


like
 the
 work
 that
 we're
 doing
 through


the
 Han
 Foundation,
 at least
 material


improves
 the
 well-being
 of
 of
 other


humans,
 you
 know,
 like
 it
 actually
 has
 a


real
 impact
 both
 for
 the
 environment
 and


for
 people.
 Well,
 I
 don't
 know,
 Alex.
 I


I
 think
 watching
 you
 climb
 Taipei
 and


watching
 the
 millions
 of
 people
 all


around
 the
 world
 climb
 Taipei
 was
 an


expansive
 moment
 for
 all
 of
 us
 because


it
 all
 it
 holds
 a
 mirror
 up
 to
 us
 in
 a


really
 inspiring
 way
 and
 goes,
 "What


obstacles
 can
 you
 overcome
 in
 your


life?"
 And


>> um
 the
 many
 many
 millions
 of
 people
 now


have
 that
 visual
 and
 sometimes
 it
 is
 an


absurd
 visual
 that
 does
 that
 and
 it's


most
 memorable
 like
 it
 etched
 into
 their


brains
 and
 that
 means
 that
 they
 in
 their


own
 life
 are
 looking
 for
 their
 own
 type


A1
 ones
 or
 type
 A7s
 or
 type
 A
 101's
 and


if
 you
 play
 that
 forward
 as
 like
 a


ripple
 in
 the
 ocean
 of
 how
 people
 are


going
 to
 strive
 and
 maybe
 live
 more


intentionally
 maybe
 maybe
 it
 does
 really


really
 matter.
 maybe
 the
 whole


conversation
 which
 was
 like
 my
 entire


Twitter
 feed
 for
 days
 and
 days
 and
 days


of
 people
 saying
 this
 is
 a
 miraculous


human
 achievement


it
 there's
 like
 that's
 the
 first
 half
 of


a
 sentence
 the
 other
 half
 of
 that


sentence
 which
 we
 never
 really
 hear
 is


like
 so
 now
 what
 can
 I
 do
 mhm
 and
 that


is
 a
 profound
 thing
 well
 that's


definitely
 the
 best
 frame
 like
 that's


the
 framing
 that
 I
 hope
 for
 and
 that's


you
 know
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 like
 the


best
 case
 scenario
 for
 my
 climbing
 and


like
 I
 I
 hope
 that
 that's
 how
 people


take
 it
 but
 I
 will
 say
 that
 the
 work


through
 the
 hauntation
 at
 least
 has
 a


direct
 material
 impact
 immediately
 and


you're
 kind
 of
 like
 oh
 you
 don't
 have
 to


hope
 for
 ripples
 or
 anything.
 You're


like
 well
 this
 person
 can
 now
 read
 after


dark
 for
 the
 first
 time
 ever
 and
 you're


like
 that
 is
 gamechanging.
 If
 anything


you
 know
 I've
 been
 talking
 a
 lot
 about


like
 action
 speaking
 louder
 than
 words


and
 I'm
 like
 yeah
 I
 hope
 to
 you
 know


like
 it's
 great
 if
 the
 climbing
 I
 do


inspires
 people
 like
 that's
 all
 good
 but


at
 some
 point
 you
 just
 do
 a
 direct
 thing


that
 actually
 helps
 people's
 lives
 too.


>> And
 you're
 doing
 both.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Aspiring
 too.
 Doing
 my
 best.


>> The
 tangible
 and
 the
 intangible.


>> Alex,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Thank
 you.


Amazing
 conversation.


>> Thank
 you.


>> YouTube
 have
 this
 new
 crazy
 algorithm


where
 they
 know
 exactly
 what
 video
 you


would
 like
 to
 watch
 next
 based
 on
 AI
 and


all
 of
 your
 viewing
 behavior.
 And
 the


algorithm
 says
 that
 this
 video
 is
 the


perfect
 video
 for
 you.
 It's
 different


for
 everybody
 looking
 right
 now.
 Check


this
 video
 out
 and
 I
 bet
 you
 you
