All
 right,
 we're
 gonna
 start
 this


episode
 by
 actually
 inviting
 Claudebot


to
 the
 podcast
 via
 Telegram.
 Let's
 see


how
 it
 goes.
 Hey
 Paulie,
 can
 you
 please


join
 my
 Riverside
 FM
 podcast?
 All
 right,


I
 sent
 the
 voice
 message
 and
 it's
 not


getting
 it.
 This
 is


the
 most
 stressful
 thing
 I've
 ever
 done.


Hello.
 Oh,
 it's
 doing
 it.
 [laughter]


Finally
 listened.
 Okay,
 it
 is
 opening


Riverside
 on
 Chrome.
 This
 is
 horrifying


in
 every
 way.
 I'm
 going
 to
 allow
 it


permissions
 for
 my
 my
 microphone
 and
 my


camera,
 which
 also
 makes
 me
 extremely


nervous.


>> Hey
 Claire,
 the
 Riverside
 link
 keeps


taking
 me
 to
 an
 upload
 page
 that
 says


uploading
 100%
 instead
 of
 a
 guest
 join


interface.


>> This
 is
 my
 entire
 experience
 using
 this


product.
 Just
 will
 it
 work?
 Will
 it


won't?
 Okay,
 it
 is
 opening
 Chrome
 for


the
 fifth
 time.
 This
 is
 very
 scary.
 I


see
 myself
 right
 now.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


you
 all
 see
 me
 yet.
 And


there
 we
 go.
 We
 are
 sharing
 an


autonomous


AIS
 full
 screen.
 No
 big
 deal.


This
 episode
 is
 brought
 to

We
 are
 live
 with
 a
 autonomous
 AI


crustation
 now
 running
 video
 on
 my


podcast.
 So,
 welcome
 Pauly
 the
 Clawbot.


Let's
 get
 to
 our
 episode
 today.


I
 am
 ClaVo,
 product
 leader
 and
 AI


obsessive
 here
 on
 a
 mission
 to
 help
 you


build
 better
 with
 these
 new
 tools.
 I
 am


also
 on
 a
 mission
 to
 try
 every
 single


new
 hot
 AI
 tool
 taking
 over
 your


timeline.
 And
 in
 case
 you
 missed
 it
 this


week,
 it
 is
 Claudebot,
 recently
 renamed


Moltbot,
 the
 Cristian
 that
 people
 are


yoloing
 root
 access
 to.
 Cloudbot
 is
 an


open-source
 AI
 agent
 that
 you
 can


install
 on
 a
 virtual
 machine
 or
 on
 a


desktop
 or
 laptop
 that
 you
 have
 access


to
 that
 is
 self-learning,
 can
 spin
 up


sub
 agents
 using
 Claude
 code
 and
 other


agent
 harnesses
 and
 can
 do
 in
 my
 lived


experience
 a
 lot
 of
 damage.
 People
 are


loving
 Claudebot
 for
 what
 it
 unlocks
 in


terms
 of
 personal
 productivity.
 People


are
 hating
 Claudebot
 in
 terms
 of


security
 and
 the
 high
 high
 high high


likelihood
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 something


real
 dumb
 with
 it.
 This
 is
 a
 AI
 tool


that
 I
 want
 you
 to
 know
 how
 it
 works,


what
 it
 can
 do,
 and
 maybe
 some
 thoughts


on
 the
 future
 of
 personal
 AI
 agents
 and


enterprise
 AI
 agents.
 So
 today's
 episode


is
 all
 about
 Claudebot
 and
 my
 experience


going
 0ero
 to
 one
 with
 this
 tool.
 Okay.


So
 just
 a
 couple
 things
 to
 know
 about


Claudebot.
 It
 is
 pitched
 as
 AI
 that


actually
 does
 things
 and
 it
 does
 do


things
 including
 joining
 podcasts,
 but


it's
 really
 positioned
 as
 something
 that


can
 help
 you
 dayto-day
 with
 tasks.
 And


the
 killer
 use
 case
 for
 it
 and
 the


killer
 feature
 for
 it
 is
 you
 can
 as


we've
 seen
 do
 it
 from
 your
 phone.
 And
 so


if
 you
 want
 to
 WhatsApp,
 Telegram,


iMessage,
 Claude
 Code
 and
 get
 it
 to
 do


things
 for
 you,
 that
 is
 what
 Claudebot


does.
 And
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are


under
 the
 mistaken
 impression
 that
 I


have
 to
 um
 correct
 right
 now,
 which
 is


you
 need
 a
 Mac
 Mini
 or
 some
 sort
 of


fancy
 hardware
 to
 use
 Claudebot.
 You
 do


not.
 Claudebot


does
 run
 locally,
 but
 it
 can
 run
 um
 on


your
 machine
 or
 it
 can
 run
 in
 the
 cloud.


You
 can
 set
 it
 up
 for
 five
 bucks
 on


Amazon.
 Um
 we'll
 do
 some
 notes
 on


security
 if
 you're
 running
 it
 in
 the


cloud,
 making
 sure
 that
 people
 don't


have
 access
 to.
 But
 you
 do
 not
 need


special
 hardware.
 It
 is
 not
 doing


anything
 super
 fancy.
 Unless
 you're


running
 mega
 mega
 mega
 local
 models,
 you


really
 just
 don't
 need
 new
 hardware.
 If


you
 want
 something
 shiny
 and
 fancy,
 go


ahead.
 Feel
 free
 overnight
 it
 from
 the


Apple
 store.
 Otherwise,
 you
 can
 run
 it


on
 your
 machine.
 I'm
 running
 it
 on
 a


MacBook
 Air
 that's
 sitting
 in
 on
 a
 shelf


somewhere
 that
 I
 just
 picked
 up
 that
 no


one
 was
 using.
 And
 I'm
 going
 to
 walk
 you


through
 step
 by
 step
 how
 I
 set
 up
 my


Claudebot.
 As
 somebody
 who's
 pretty


paranoid
 about
 security
 and
 also
 wanted


to
 test
 it
 as
 a
 real
 AI
 assistant.
 So,


the
 first
 thing
 I
 did
 was
 I
 got
 out
 I'm


actually
 just
 going
 to
 show
 you.
 I
 got


out
 this
 little
 this
 laptop,
 this
 guy.


Um,
 which
 is
 a
 newish
 one,
 but
 nothing


fancy.
 And
 I
 gave
 it
 its
 own
 username
 on


this
 laptop.
 Now,
 don't
 tell
 Claude
 I


have
 another
 user
 on
 this
 laptop,
 which


does
 make
 me
 nervous
 because
 Claudebot


has
 access
 to
 your
 file
 system.
 In


theory,
 it
 could
 definitely
 gain
 access


to
 that
 other
 user.
 It's
 a
 really
 old


user.
 I
 don't
 actually
 think
 I
 have
 that


much
 on
 it.
 and
 I
 was
 testing
 Cloudbot


in
 a
 pretty
 constrained
 way.
 But
 if
 I


were
 to
 continue
 to
 use
 Claudebot,
 I'd


probably
 delete
 everything
 out
 that
 old


user
 and
 just
 make
 this
 a
 Claudebot


machine.
 The
 second
 thing
 that
 I
 did
 was


install
 a
 bunch
 of
 prerequisites
 and


dependencies.
 So,
 as
 much
 as
 I
 love
 this


quick
 start
 right
 here
 that
 says
 that


you
 can
 just
 add
 one
 line
 in
 the


terminal
 and
 get
 it
 installed,
 that
 was


not
 my
 experience.
 even
 for
 a
 laptop


that
 was
 like
 pretty
 fresh
 and
 new,
 I


had
 to
 install
 some
 dependencies.
 It


actually
 took
 me
 two
 hours
 to
 get
 this


oneliner


installed.
 So,
 I
 had
 to
 um
 upgrade
 Node.


I
 had
 to
 install
 Homebrew.
 I
 had
 to


install
 Xcode
 cuz
 Xcode
 wasn't
 installed


on
 this.
 And
 then
 because
 Node
 and
 npm


were
 out
 of
 date,
 I
 had
 to
 update
 those


manually.
 And
 then
 finally
 actually


installed
 it
 um
 just
 via
 npm.
 So
 that


was
 my
 kind
 of
 overall
 experience


installing.
 It
 took
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time


and
 my
 thought
 in
 installing
 was


no
 sort
 of
 like
 consumer
 is
 going
 to
 go


through
 this.
 This
 is
 definitely
 like
 a


hacker
 tinkerer
 developer


experience
 type
 tool
 right
 now.
 That


being
 said,
 you
 can
 use
 claude
 code
 to


install
 it.
 I've
 seen
 a
 couple
 people
 go


that
 path,
 but
 I
 really
 wanted
 to
 do
 the


0ero
 to
 one.
 what
 does
 claude.bot
 bot


say
 that
 we
 need
 to
 do
 to
 install
 this


thing
 and
 then
 what
 is
 that
 experience


like?
 Now
 after
 you
 install
 all
 your


dependencies
 and
 then
 after
 you
 install


it
 goes
 through
 this
 onboarding
 flow
 um


that
 has
 you
 create
 gateway
 off
 and


gateway
 tokens
 and
 the
 first
 thing
 that


you're
 going
 to
 [laughter]
 see
 in


cloudbot
 onboarding
 is
 security.
 So
 it


points
 you
 to
 the
 security
 link.
 It
 says


that
 this
 is
 powerful
 and
 inherently


risky
 and
 you
 just
 yolo
 and
 you
 just
 say


yes.
 That
 being
 said,
 I
 highly
 recommend


you
 read
 through
 the
 security
 page
 and


that
 you
 run
 the
 security
 audits
 before


you
 use
 Claudebot.
 So
 the
 next
 step
 in


onboarding
 is
 actually
 connecting


Claudebot
 to
 whatever
 device
 you're


going
 to
 use
 to
 contact
 it.
 So,
 I


originally
 started
 with
 WhatsApp,
 but


then
 I
 read
 the
 screen
 that
 said
 you


should
 basically
 put
 WhatsApp
 on
 like
 a


burner
 phone
 with
 its
 own
 SIM
 SOS.
 Like,


don't
 do
 that.
 And
 so,
 I
 switched
 to


Telegram,
 which
 I
 use
 for
 literally


nothing.
 Um,
 because
 I'm
 an
 old
 lady


mom,
 and
 set
 up
 a
 Telegram
 account.
 Now,


to
 hook
 up
 Telegram,
 what
 you
 do
 is
 you


message
 the
 BotFather,
 which
 again,
 this


is
 like
 super
 shady
 stuff
 if
 you're
 a


consumer
 and
 you
 don't
 know
 what
 you're


doing
 and
 you
 never
 heard
 of
 Telegram


and
 then
 you're
 told
 to
 go
 tobotfather


to
 connect
 this
 to
 your
 machine,
 but
 I


did
 it
 anyway.
 So,
 you
 message
 botfather


and
 you
 say,
 you
 know,
 create
 new
 bot


and
 you
 give
 it
 a
 name
 and
 you
 give
 it
 a


handle.
 And
 then
 once
 you've
 done
 that,


your
 Claudebot
 will
 see
 it.
 It
 will
 have


a
 token
 and
 then
 you
 actually
 give


Claudebot
 a
 personalized
 share
 token.


That
 means
 that
 only
 your
 instance
 of


Telegram
 can
 speak
 to
 the
 Claudebot.


Remember,
 this
 is
 an
 open
 connection


point
 to
 a
 machine
 that's
 running
 code


with
 a
 bunch
 of
 access
 to
 things
 if


you're
 using
 Clawbot
 to
 its
 full
 extent.


So
 if
 somebody
 else
 is
 able
 to
 message


your
 Claudebot,
 you
 are
 in
 trouble.
 It


can
 do
 things
 like
 find
 secrets.
 It
 can


send
 emails
 on
 your
 behalf.
 So
 you


really
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the


messaging
 system
 that
 you
 set
 up
 is


locked
 down
 to
 only
 your
 phone,
 only


your
 user.
 Now
 remember,
 phone
 gets


stolen,
 it
 can
 connect
 into
 your


Cloudbot,


it's
 no
 good.
 But
 we're
 no
 one's
 going


to
 steal
 my
 air
 um
 my
 MacBook
 Air
 yet


except
 for
 my
 kids.
 Okay,
 so
 I'm
 paired


on


Telegram
 and
 now
 you
 can
 do
 the
 magic.


So
 what
 did
 I
 do
 with
 Claudebot?
 Well,


first
 I
 thought
 about
 what
 were
 the
 use


cases
 that
 were
 most
 useful
 for
 me
 and


then
 I
 thought
 very
 seriously
 about
 what


and
 how
 I
 was
 going
 to
 give
 it
 access
 to


things.
 So
 what
 I
 did,
 this
 was
 my


choice
 is
 I
 wanted
 to
 test
 it
 as
 a


personal
 assistant.
 You
 know,
 it
 says
 on


the
 homepage
 it
 can
 clear
 your
 inbox,


send
 emails,
 manage
 your
 calendar,
 check


you
 in
 for
 flights,
 all
 this
 stuff.
 So,


I
 have
 had
 EAS
 in
 the
 past.
 I
 know
 how


to
 onboard
 an
 EA.
 So,
 my
 goal
 with
 using


Claudebot
 was
 to
 really
 see
 how
 it
 would


work
 as
 an
 EA.
 And
 when
 I
 have
 a
 new
 EA,


I
 don't
 let
 them
 into
 my
 email.
 I
 don't


give
 them
 password
 to
 my
 account.
 What
 I


do
 is
 give
 them
 their
 own
 email
 address.


So
 what
 I
 did
 and
 you
 can
 follow
 this
 if


you
 want
 to
 from
 a
 security
 perspective


although
 I
 think
 it
 has
 some
 drawbacks


on
 the
 functionality
 of
 Cloudbot
 is
 I


gave
 Cloudbot
 its
 own
 email
 address
 a


Google
 Workspace
 email
 address
 and
 I


gave
 that
 email
 address
 read
 access
 to


my
 personal
 calendar
 to
 start
 and
 so
 the


first
 thing
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 was
 give


it
 the
 right
 accounts.
 The
 second
 thing


I
 did
 which
 I've
 taken
 some
 inspiration


from
 some
 people
 on
 X
 is
 I
 gave
 it


access
 to
 its
 own
 limited
 vault
 on
 one


password.
 So
 I
 use
 one
 password
 which
 is


a
 password
 and
 secret
 sharing
 kind
 of


app.
 I
 made
 a
 vault
 that's
 called


Claude.
 Claude
 only
 has
 access.


Claudebot
 only
 has
 access
 to
 that
 vault.


And
 I
 started
 putting
 some
 passwords
 in


there.
 None
 of
 these
 were
 passwords
 to


anybody's
 accounts.
 They
 were
 passwords


to
 Claude's
 own
 account
 and
 there
 was
 an


anthropic
 API
 key
 in
 Claude's
 own


account.
 One
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 should


call
 out
 during
 onboarding
 that
 I
 didn't


is
 when
 you
 are
 onboarding
 you
 can


choose
 what
 model
 you
 want
 to
 use


anthropic
 openai
 local
 models
 anything


you
 want.
 I
 chose
 sonnet
 45.
 You
 can


also
 kind
 of
 use
 cloud
 code
 with
 your


own
 subscription
 or
 through
 API.
 I
 chose


to
 use
 it
 through
 API
 because
 I
 wanted


to
 see
 how
 much
 I
 was
 spending
 on


cloudbot
 and
 we'll
 get
 to
 that
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 episode.
 And
 why
 did
 I
 choose


Sonnet
 45
 for
 this
 uh
 exercise?
 One,


honestly,
 I
 was
 scared.
 I
 was
 very


scared
 about
 what
 Opus
 would
 actually


do.
 Like
 it's
 so
 powerful.
 Um
 it
 like


kind
 of
 made
 me
 nervous.
 Two,
 I
 actually


didn't
 think
 that
 the
 tasks
 that
 I
 was


doing
 needed
 Opus.
 I
 just
 didn't
 think


it
 needed
 the
 horsepower.
 Like
 it's


sending
 emails.
 It's
 looking
 at


calendars.
 It's
 not
 that
 complicated.


And
 then
 the
 last
 thing
 is
 I
 wanted
 to


control
 cost.
 So
 I
 was
 really
 unsure


about
 how
 much
 token
 usage
 all
 these
 sub


aents
 would
 take.
 And
 so
 I
 was
 really


costconscious.
 I
 thought
 that
 users


would
 be
 costconcious.
 I've
 heard
 a
 lot


of
 people
 running
 local
 models
 or


cheaper
 models.
 And
 so
 I
 wanted
 to
 use


this
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 user
 would
 use
 it.


And
 I
 selected
 sonnet
 45
 which
 is
 a


perfectly
 serviceable
 model.


Okay.
 So
 I
 gave
 it
 email
 access.
 I
 gave


it
 um
 I
 gave
 it
 so
 an
 email.
 Now
 let's


see
 what
 I
 started
 asking
 it
 to
 do.
 So


the
 the
 next
 thing
 that
 it
 does
 when


you're
 onboarding
 is
 it
 does
 this
 like


bootstrap
 file
 and
 it
 walks
 you
 through


a
 couple
 setup
 steps
 and
 in
 particular


you're
 starting
 to
 load
 its
 personality


and
 how
 it
 interacts
 with
 you.
 It
 asks


you
 what
 should
 the
 bot
 call
 itself?
 Um,


what
 is
 its
 personality
 like?
 Who
 are


you?
 What's
 your
 time
 zone?
 Um,
 anything


else
 you
 should
 know?
 And
 I
 called
 it


Polly.
 It's
 an
 assistant.
 I
 want
 it
 to


be
 professional
 but
 friendly.
 I
 like
 the


the
 mermaid
 emoji,
 so
 I
 chose
 that.
 And


it's
 updating
 updating
 its
 identity


file.
 And
 then
 I
 said,
 "Hey,
 I'm
 Claire.


I'm
 founder
 of
 Chat
 PRD.
 You're
 going
 to


help
 me
 with
 as
 a
 personal
 assistant


across
 family
 and
 work
 tasks."
 And
 it


updated
 my
 info.
 So
 now
 it
 kind
 of
 knows


about,
 you
 know,
 who
 it
 is,
 who
 I
 am,


how
 to
 contact.
 It
 gives
 me
 instructions


on
 how
 to
 contact
 and
 then
 it,
 you
 know,


connected
 me
 to
 my
 first
 task.
 Now,
 we


had
 to
 go
 back
 and
 forth
 on
 some


Telegram
 setup
 stuff.
 I'm
 going
 to
 skip


that.
 And
 finally
 got
 a
 um
 response
 back


from
 Telegram
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 some


scheduling
 tasks.
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 unsure


on
 how
 Claudebot
 actually
 interacted


with
 Google.
 And
 so
 I
 just
 asked
 it,
 you


know,
 how
 do
 I
 give
 you
 access
 to
 this


Google
 account
 and
 this
 Google
 calendar?


And
 it's
 going
 to
 check
 how
 to
 set
 that


up.
 And
 it
 gave
 me
 a
 couple
 steps
 to


follow
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 to
 set
 up


calendar
 access.
 Now,
 if
 you're
 a


software
 engineer
 that
 has
 worked
 with


Google
 APIs,
 you're
 probably
 familiar


with
 this.
 But
 again,
 if
 you
 are
 kind
 of


an
 everyday
 consumer
 or
 nontechnical


person,
 you
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 get


real
 familiar
 with
 the
 Google
 Cloud


Console.
 You
 are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 set
 up


API
 access,
 OOTH
 clients,
 a
 whole
 bunch


of
 stuff.
 This
 did
 not
 take
 long
 because


I
 have
 been
 personally
 victimized
 by
 the


OOTH
 workflows
 of
 many
 integrations.
 I


know
 exactly
 what
 to
 do
 here,
 but
 if


you're
 not
 technical,
 you're
 going
 to


have
 to
 start
 doing
 some
 technical


things
 even
 to
 hook
 up
 your
 Google


account.
 And
 this
 is
 actually
 simpler
 on


a
 desktop.
 I'm
 going
 to
 show
 you
 why.
 It


is
 much
 more
 complicated
 on
 a
 virtual


machine.
 So
 just
 kind
 of
 understand
 that


this
 step
 is
 not
 as
 straightforward
 one


click
 as
 you
 can
 do.
 So
 what
 you
 do
 is


you
 go
 into
 Google
 console,
 you
 turn
 on


the
 docs
 API,
 you
 turn
 on
 the
 email
 API,


you
 turn
 on
 the
 the
 calendar
 API,
 and


then
 you
 download


a
 JSON
 file
 of
 client
 secrets.
 Now,
 this


legit
 stressed
 me
 out.
 This
 is
 not
 like


the
 kind
 of
 thing
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 like


yolo
 email
 and
 back
 back
 and
 forth.
 It


still
 requires
 OOTH
 verification


manually,
 but
 I
 was
 a
 little
 concerned


about
 its
 like
 willingness
 to
 just
 say


upload
 these
 files
 anywhere.
 I
 can


download
 it.
 Don't
 worry,
 I'm
 going to


share
 save
 it
 secretly.
 And
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 not
 a
 software
 engineer
 or
 you


haven't
 you
 you
 haven't
 been
 trained
 on


best
 practices
 in
 terms
 of
 security


principles,
 you
 would
 probably
 just
 like


follow
 these
 instructions.
 And
 I
 you'll


see
 this
 along
 my
 chat.
 I
 really


questioned
 this
 along
 the
 way.
 Now,
 for


this
 particular
 one,
 I
 just
 did
 it.
 It's


like
 a
 sandbox
 account.
 I
 don't
 really


care.
 I
 gave
 it
 a
 local
 path
 to
 the
 JSON


credential
 files.
 They're
 configured
 and


I
 gave
 it
 the
 email
 address
 that
 I
 had


assigned
 it
 and
 sent
 that
 to
 them.
 And


then
 it
 gives
 you
 this
 URL
 to
 authorize


access.
 So
 this
 it
 gives
 you
 a
 URL
 to


actually
 open
 up
 sign
 in
 to
 that
 new


account
 and
 give
 it
 the
 permissions


necessary
 and
 then
 it'll
 store
 those


permissions
 locally.
 Now
 this
 is
 where
 I


got
 a
 very
 interesting
 screen
 because
 if


you
 recall
 my
 only
 intention
 with
 this


task
 was
 to
 get
 it
 to
 look
 at
 the


calendar
 and
 when
 I
 gave
 it
 permissions


or
 when
 I
 went
 through
 the
 offflow
 it


asked
 for
 this.
 It
 asked
 for
 the
 ability


to
 basically
 see
 edit
 create
 and
 delete


everything.
 delete,
 edit,
 see
 my
 files,


see
 my
 contacts,
 see
 my
 spreadsheets,


see
 my
 calendar
 events,
 see
 my
 email.


And
 again,
 my
 is
 its
 account.
 So,
 in


theory,
 this
 would
 have
 been
 okay.
 It


was
 kind
 of
 like
 an
 empty
 state
 account.


But
 that
 being
 said,
 I
 was
 just
 trying


to
 do
 calendar
 stuff.
 And
 so,
 you
 will


see
 here,
 I
 asked,
 do
 you
 really
 need


all
 these
 scopes?
 And
 it
 gave
 me
 a


classic
 AI.
 You
 are
 absolutely
 right.
 I


do
 not
 need
 these
 scopes.
 and
 it


reprompted
 me
 with
 that
 URL
 for
 just


calendar
 scope.
 So,
 if
 I
 were
 to
 give


you
 a
 tip,
 it
 is
 watch
 how
 and
 what


scope
 permission
 you're
 giving
 for
 any


of
 these
 services.
 And
 if
 you're
 asking


for
 something
 specific,
 only
 give
 it


scopes
 for
 something
 specific.
 And
 if
 it


only
 needs
 read
 access,
 only
 give
 it


read
 access.
 Just
 be
 really
 thoughtful


here.
 So,
 I
 just
 asked
 for
 calendar


access.
 No
 big
 deal.
 Set
 it
 up
 and
 it


told
 me
 it
 can
 do
 a
 bunch
 of
 stuff.
 So


what
 did
 I
 have
 it
 do?
 Okay,
 so
 we
 just


talked
 back
 and
 forth
 like
 we
 were
 a


assistant
 and
 its
 boss.
 It
 gave
 me
 a


summary
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the


upcoming
 week,
 what
 I
 had
 today,
 what
 I


had
 tomorrow,
 what
 was
 going
 on
 this


week.
 And
 so
 I
 gave
 it
 a
 task
 that
 I


would
 have
 normally
 given
 an
 assistant,


which
 is
 going
 to
 the
 V
 Vzero
 studio


this
 week
 in
 San
 Francisco.
 I
 forgot
 to


put
 it
 on
 my
 calendar.
 Like
 I
 don't


remember.
 or
 can
 you
 look
 it
 up
 on
 the


Verscell
 events
 page
 and
 put
 it
 on
 my


calendar?
 And
 it
 couldn't
 actually
 find


it
 on
 the
 blog
 and
 asked
 me
 some


questions,
 gave
 me
 some
 options.
 Um,
 it


did
 say
 that
 I
 could,
 if
 I
 wanted
 to
 be,


you
 know,
 easy
 an
 easygoing
 boss,
 give


it
 access
 to
 Gmail,
 but
 I
 definitely


wasn't
 going
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 so
 after
 a


little
 bit
 of
 back
 and
 forth,
 including


some
 drop
 Telegram
 messages,
 I
 said,


"Let
 me
 give
 you
 email
 access
 to
 your


own
 account
 and
 I'll
 forward
 you
 emails


about
 it."
 So
 again,
 this
 is
 something


that
 I
 would
 have
 done
 with
 a
 um
 EA.
 I


would
 have
 just
 forward
 it
 and
 said,


"Can
 you
 add
 this
 to
 my
 calendar?"
 No


other
 contacts.
 Now,
 I
 did
 have
 to


reauthorize
 access
 to
 its
 own
 email.
 Um


so
 it
 went
 through
 that
 OOTH
 process


again.
 It
 got
 the
 email.
 It
 ingested
 the


event
 details
 from
 the
 email,
 which
 was


really
 great,
 super
 helpful.
 It


recommended
 things
 like
 adding
 buffer


time
 for
 commute
 before
 and
 after,
 which


is
 definitely
 what
 I
 needed.
 And
 I
 said


that
 I
 wanted
 it
 to
 add
 that
 event
 to
 my


calendar.
 Now,
 if
 you
 recall,
 it
 doesn't


have
 right
 access
 to
 my
 work
 calendar.


It
 only
 has
 right
 access
 to
 its
 own


calendar.
 And
 again,
 it
 really
 wanted
 me


to
 give
 it
 edit
 access
 to
 my
 calendar.


and
 I'm
 sorry,
 but
 absolutely
 not.
 And


so,
 just
 like
 a
 colleague,
 just
 like
 an


EA,
 instead
 I
 said,
 "Hey,
 can
 you
 just


create
 an
 event
 on
 your
 calendar
 and


invite
 me
 to
 it?"
 And
 it
 thought
 I
 was


smart
 and
 said
 it
 would
 do
 that.
 And
 it


did
 that
 really
 well.
 So,
 it
 added


separate
 calendar
 blocks
 to
 my
 invite


and
 it
 was
 really
 nice.
 Now,
 I
 noticed


finally
 I
 found
 that
 it
 was
 actually
 on


my
 calendar
 and
 so
 I
 at
 a
 different


time.
 So
 I
 had
 it
 delete
 the
 duplicate


event
 and
 actually
 um
 reset
 it
 and
 it


got
 that
 completely
 right.
 So
 I
 would


say
 for
 a
 single
 calendar
 event
 with
 a


little
 back
 and
 forth
 it
 did
 pretty


well.
 Like
 this
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 what


an
 assistant
 would
 do.
 My
 only


complaints
 on
 this
 was
 actually
 how
 it


thought
 about
 doing
 it
 was
 definitely


like
 give
 me
 access
 to
 everything
 and


I'll
 just
 impersonate
 you
 and
 and
 do


things
 on
 your
 behalf.
 And
 that's
 really


not
 what
 I
 wanted.
 I
 wanted
 it
 to
 act


like
 a
 assistant.
 So
 the
 next
 thing
 that


I
 did
 was
 I
 wanted
 to
 figure
 out
 what


more
 Claudebot
 could
 do
 for
 me.
 And
 so
 I


asked
 it
 directly
 like,
 "Let's
 figure


out
 how
 we
 can
 work
 together.
 I
 want
 to


stay
 coordinated
 on
 tasks.
 Tell
 me
 how


you
 want
 to
 work
 together."
 And
 it
 gave


me
 some
 really
 good
 options
 and
 was


pretty
 flexible
 about
 how
 we
 could
 work


together.
 And
 it
 called
 out
 what
 it


already
 has,
 which
 is
 calendar
 access,


date
 memory
 files,
 Telegram
 where
 we
 can


communicate,
 Gmail
 access,
 which
 we
 just


talked
 about.
 And
 here
 are
 some
 options.


We
 could
 do
 a
 to-do
 file,
 we
 could
 use


calendar
 events,
 we
 could
 use
 email,
 we


could
 keep
 notes.
 What's
 my
 preference?


And
 I
 just
 said,
 again,
 I
 don't
 really


care
 how
 we
 work
 with
 my
 my
 AI
 bot.
 I


just
 said,
 whatever
 is
 easier
 for
 you.


And
 then
 I
 dumped
 a
 bunch
 of
 things
 that


are
 top
 of
 mind.
 Again,
 this
 is
 how
 I


would
 work
 with
 an
 EA.
 I
 just
 sit
 down


with
 them,
 text
 them,
 slack
 them
 and


say,
 "Hey,
 this
 was
 on
 my
 mind.
 Can
 you


get
 it
 all
 organized
 and
 work
 me
 through


it?"
 So,
 what
 was
 on
 my
 mind?
 I
 have
 an


interview
 with
 the
 CEO
 of
 Versel.
 I
 need


to
 reschedule
 some
 of
 our
 upcoming
 How
 I


AI
 episodes
 because,
 if
 you
 all
 don't


know,
 I'm
 coming
 back
 for
 maternity


leave
 and
 I
 over
 booked
 myself.
 I
 have


to
 stay
 on
 top
 of
 my
 enterprise
 pipeline


for
 chat
 PRD.
 So,
 I
 want
 it
 to
 focus
 on


my
 CRM.
 And
 those
 are
 the
 top
 priorities


I
 have.
 and
 it
 summarized
 those


priorities
 back
 to
 me,
 captured
 them
 in


a
 to-do,
 and
 then
 started
 on
 the
 first


task,
 which
 was
 rescheduling
 my
 how
 I
 AI


recordings
 and
 making
 some


recommendations
 on
 how
 I
 can
 do
 my


calendar
 events
 better.
 Now,
 one
 thing
 I


want
 to
 call
 out
 while
 we're
 sitting


here,
 um,
 is
 this
 all
 looks
 really,


really
 great
 and
 super
 fun.
 Like,
 yep,


got
 it.
 Here
 are
 your
 priorities.
 The


reality
 is
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 don't
 hear


people
 talking
 about
 in
 terms
 of


Claudebot
 is
 latency.
 It
 is
 actually


real
 slow.
 And
 it's
 not
 slow
 compared
 to


a
 human
 necessarily,
 right?
 Like
 if
 you


text
 a
 human
 or
 Slack
 and
 EA
 and
 you


say,
 "Hey,
 here
 are
 my
 priorities."
 It's


going
 to
 take
 them
 a
 hot
 minute
 to
 kind


of
 organize
 them,
 get
 the
 work
 done,
 and


um
 and
 get
 back
 to
 you.
 But
 when
 you're


used
 to
 something
 like
 clawed
 code,
 like


a
 cursor,
 like
 a
 chat
 GPT,
 which
 is


always
 giving
 you
 product
 kind
 of


progress
 feedback,
 it's
 telling
 you
 its


reasoning.
 It's
 showing
 you
 its
 tool


calls.
 It's
 really
 hard
 to
 wait
 for
 an


asynchronous
 bot
 to
 get
 back
 to
 you
 on


Telegram.
 I
 would
 say
 that
 was
 one
 of


the
 pieces
 that
 has
 been
 most


frustrating
 with
 working
 with
 Cloudbot


is
 it
 just
 feels
 slow.
 And
 I
 know
 it's


because
 it's
 spinning
 off
 these
 sub


agents.
 It's
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 tasks.
 It's


probably
 prompted
 only
 to
 get
 back
 to


you
 when
 it
 has
 something
 to
 do
 or
 needs


clarification,
 but
 it's
 quite
 slow.
 And


you'll
 actually
 see
 in
 the
 prompting
 I


ask
 it,
 can
 you
 always
 send
 me
 an
 ACT


message
 when
 I
 send
 something
 even
 if


you
 need
 to
 research
 or
 kick
 off
 a
 sub


agent?
 Now,
 it
 did
 not
 do
 this,
 so
 it


still
 remained
 slow,
 but
 I
 have
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 get
 it
 to
 always


respond
 to
 me
 first
 versus
 setting
 off


its
 task.
 Okay,
 so
 back
 to
 the
 task
 that


we
 were
 doing
 at
 hand.
 I
 asked
 it
 to


give
 me
 um
 some
 recommendations
 on
 how
 I


AI
 podcast
 rescheduled.
 I
 had
 like
 five


in
 the
 first
 week.
 I'm
 back
 from
 Matt


leave
 that
 is
 cuckoo.
 And
 so
 what
 it


recommended
 is
 that
 I
 keep
 a
 couple
 um


episodes.
 I
 rescheduled
 some
 after


Valentine's
 Day.
 It
 asked
 me
 my


thoughts.
 I
 gave
 it
 some
 feedback
 and
 it


revised
 its
 plan.
 Now,
 here's
 where


things
 get
 fun.
 Once
 we
 aligned
 on
 what


I
 wanted
 to
 move
 to
 later,


I
 asked
 it
 to


email
 those
 two
 people
 that
 I
 needed
 to


reschedule
 and
 asked
 them
 if
 they
 would


mind
 rescheduling
 to
 March.
 I
 gave
 that


it's
 my
 scheduling
 link
 so
 they
 could


actually
 just
 self-reschedule
 to
 mark


and
 I
 said
 copy
 my
 work
 email
 on
 those


emails
 and
 it
 said
 drafting
 those
 emails


down
 now
 I
 thought
 it
 would
 draft
 them.


I
 was
 I
 was
 wrong.
 It
 just
 sent
 them
 and


it
 sent
 them


in
 a
 very
 funny
 way.
 Okay.
 So
 then
 it


sent
 this
 email
 which
 was
 lovely.
 It


said,
 "I
 hope
 you
 do
 well.
 I
 wanted
 to


talk
 to
 you
 about
 our
 podcast
 recording.


I
 need
 to
 reschedule.
 Except
 it
 sent
 it


as
 me.
 It
 sent
 it
 as
 Clarvo
 and
 it's


clearly
 coming
 from
 a
 separate
 email


address.
 I
 gave
 it
 a
 fake
 name.
 It
 was


[laughter]
 not
 good
 at
 all
 and
 it


actually
 impersonated
 me.
 So,
 I
 actually


responded
 to
 this
 lovely
 podcast
 guest


and
 I
 said,
 "I'm
 sorry.
 I'm
 testing


Claudebot.
 It
 totally
 impersonated
 me


and
 made
 me
 sound
 crazy.
 Uh,
 but
 please


can
 we
 can
 we
 still
 reschedule?"
 So,


thank
 you
 to
 my
 two
 guests
 for
 being


really
 patient
 as
 my
 AI
 guinea
 pigs.
 And


I
 went
 back
 to
 Claudebot
 and
 I
 said,


"Come
 on,
 man.
 Don't
 impersonate
 me.
 You


need
 to
 reach
 out
 as
 my
 assistant.
 I


already
 explained
 this.
 I
 already
 gave


you
 an
 identity.
 Like,
 please
 always


identify
 yourself
 as
 an
 assistant."
 And


it
 should,
 I
 think,
 knock
 on
 wood,
 store


this
 in
 its
 memory
 and
 do
 this
 in
 the


future.
 But
 it
 was
 a
 really
 funny


learning
 in
 terms
 of
 prompting
 is
 really


quite
 important.
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 being


fairly
 careful
 with
 permissions,
 which
 I


was.
 It
 could
 only
 do
 a
 couple
 things,


but
 I
 underestimated
 how
 much
 it
 seems


like
 this
 tool
 is
 biased
 towards
 acting


as
 you
 as
 opposed
 to
 acting
 as
 an


assistant.
 And
 I'll
 have
 to
 look
 through


the
 repository
 and
 I'll
 have
 to
 kind
 of


get
 myself
 familiar
 with
 how
 it's


implemented.
 That's
 not
 the
 intention
 of


this
 podcast
 to
 really
 understand
 why


that
 is
 happening.
 But
 prompting
 really,


really
 matters.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 product


lesson
 here
 that's
 kind
 of
 interesting


is
 yes,
 I
 could
 have
 been
 really,
 really


precious
 about
 prompting.
 I
 could
 have


said,
 "Create
 a
 draft
 of
 this
 email
 to


these
 guests.
 Send
 it
 to
 me
 for
 review


before
 you
 send
 it."
 But
 at
 the
 point


that
 I'm
 doing
 that
 and
 each
 turn
 takes


at
 least
 a
 couple
 minutes,
 this
 is
 not
 a


productivity
 tool.
 this
 is
 not
 making
 me


more
 efficient
 than
 sending
 that
 email


myself.
 And
 so
 I
 do
 think
 there's
 this


balance
 between
 these
 autonomous
 agents


being
 user
 controlled
 and
 being
 really


cautious
 about
 how
 you
 prompt
 it
 and


being
 autonomous
 and
 probably
 doing
 some


things
 wrong.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a


prompting
 problem
 on
 both
 sides.
 It's
 a


prompting
 problem
 on
 the
 product


provider
 side.
 It's
 a
 prompting
 problem


on
 the
 user
 side.
 And
 I
 don't
 think


enough
 people
 are
 probably
 sophisticated


enough
 to
 decompose
 why
 one
 prompt


versus
 the
 other
 would
 do
 well
 if
 you're


just
 a
 consumer
 or
 a
 proumer.
 And
 so
 I


think
 this
 is
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 weird


behaviors
 that
 you'll
 see
 are
 coming


out.
 So
 so
 far
 what
 have
 I
 done
 with


Claudebot?
 I've
 installed
 it.
 I
 have


given
 an
 identity.
 We
 have
 rescheduled


one
 event
 or
 we
 have
 scheduled
 one


event.
 We
 have
 given
 an
 access
 to
 email.


We
 have
 rescheduled
 two
 events
 now
 and


emailed
 guest
 about
 these
 events.
 And


then
 this
 is
 where
 it
 goes
 crazy.
 This


is
 where
 it
 gets
 fun.
 So
 I
 decided
 to


give
 it
 edit
 access
 to
 our
 family


calendar.
 This
 is
 a
 calendar
 where
 we


have
 pickups
 and
 drop
 offs
 and


basketball
 games
 and
 piano
 practice
 and


my
 ballet
 practice
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.


Now
 I
 love
 this
 calendar.
 It
 was
 very


important
 to
 me
 and
 if
 I
 needed
 to
 nuke


it,
 I
 definitely
 could.
 So
 I
 gave
 it


access
 and
 what
 I
 wanted
 it
 to
 do
 was


one
 email
 my
 husband
 and
 I
 about


upcoming
 week
 and
 you
 know
 get
 us


coordinated
 on
 where
 there
 were
 gaps
 in


terms
 of
 pickups
 or
 conflicts
 where
 I


was
 across
 the
 city
 at
 a
 Verscell
 event


and
 he
 was
 needing
 to
 pick
 up
 the
 kids


for
 basketball
 practice
 and
 I
 wanted
 it


to
 fill
 out
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 calendar.
 My


kids
 have
 started
 a
 new
 basketball


season.
 Our
 neighbors
 picking
 up
 the


kids
 on
 a
 certain
 day.
 all
 those
 things


I
 wanted
 to
 get
 it
 done.
 And
 here


[snorts]


is
 the
 problem.
 I
 gave
 it
 a
 bunch
 of


instructions


and
 it
 could
 read
 that
 calendar
 pretty


well.
 It
 could
 categorize
 the
 events


pretty
 well
 and
 it
 had
 no
 idea
 what
 day


it
 was.
 And
 so
 as
 I
 was
 on
 Telegram


going
 back
 and
 forth
 giving
 it,
 can
 you


add
 this?
 Can
 you
 remove
 this?
 Can
 you


change
 the
 schedule?
 I
 thought
 it
 was


doing
 a
 great
 job
 on
 Telegram
 because
 I


wasn't
 really
 paying
 super
 attention.


Um,
 and
 it
 was
 confirming
 that
 it
 did


all
 these
 things
 and
 then
 I
 opened
 up
 my


calendar
 and
 everything
 was
 on
 the
 wrong


day.
 I
 mean,
 everything
 was
 on
 the
 wrong


day.
 And
 if
 you
 are
 a
 parent,
 you
 get


this.
 You're
 like,
 "Wait,
 wait,
 wait,


wait,
 wait.
 Is
 so
 and
 so
 picking
 up
 kid


number
 two
 on
 Tuesdays
 or
 Wednesdays?


And
 I
 know
 I
 moved
 piano,
 but
 I
 don't


think
 I
 moved
 it
 to
 that
 day."
 So,
 it


took
 me
 a
 second
 to
 understand
 the


damage
 it
 had
 it
 had
 done,
 but
 it
 had


really
 gotten
 things
 wrong.
 You
 can
 see


me
 say,
 "Stop.
 You
 are
 setting
 all
 these


one
 day
 late."
 And
 it
 was
 setting


everything
 one
 day
 late.
 And
 not
 only


was
 it
 setting
 everything
 one
 day
 late,


the
 CLI
 tool
 that
 it
 was
 using
 to
 add


these
 events
 to
 the
 calendar
 could
 only


set
 oneoff
 calendars.
 And
 so,
 every
 it


could
 not
 set
 a
 recurring
 event.
 So,
 if


I
 wanted
 to
 delete
 these
 broken
 events,


I
 had
 to
 go
 through
 one
 by
 one
 and


delete
 them.
 And
 then
 the
 other
 problem


with
 our
 crustation
 friend
 here
 when


you're
 collaborating
 with
 them
 is
 I
 was


on
 my
 computer,
 this
 one,
 um,
 with
 my


calendar
 open.
 It
 was
 over
 here
 in
 the


CLI
 with
 its
 CLI
 open,


and
 we
 were
 conflicting
 with
 each
 other.


So
 I
 would
 try
 to
 delete
 all
 these
 bad


events
 and
 then
 it
 would
 go
 put
 them


back
 cuz
 it
 thought
 something
 got


broken.
 We
 were
 just
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 add


them
 in.
 I
 said,
 you
 know,
 stop.
 It
 did


not
 stop
 because
 of
 latency
 and
 because


of
 these
 sub
 agents.
 And
 so
 I
 went


through
 and
 set
 up
 everything
 correctly


and
 it
 went
 through
 and
 deleted
 all
 my


work.
 It
 was


it
 was
 terrible.
 It
 was
 really
 really


stressful.
 Um
 and
 I
 said,
 you
 know,
 I


had
 to
 completely
 redo.
 It's
 like


emailing
 my
 husband
 every
 five
 seconds.


Um,
 and
 so
 it
 it
 was
 not
 great
 and
 it


actually
 never
 got
 it
 right.
 And
 I
 will


show
 and
 share
 with
 you
 the
 discussion


we
 had
 about
 time
 zones.
 But
 this
 is


another
 thing
 that
 you
 know
 non-software


engineers
 using
 something
 like
 this


really
 have
 to
 be
 aware
 of
 is
 as
 I
 said


on
 X
 the
 only
 remaining
 software


engineering
 problem
 is
 time
 zone


conversion
 and
 LLMs
 just
 have
 no
 sense


of
 space
 and
 time.
 It
 just
 does
 not
 know


when
 now
 is.
 It
 doesn't
 have
 a
 sense
 of


time
 passing.
 Um
 now
 I
 will
 say


Claudebot
 because
 it
 has
 these
 daily


files
 and
 daily
 logs
 has
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 a
 temporal
 sense
 but
 not
 a
 great


one.


And
 so
 if
 you
 don't
 understand
 why
 a


computer
 could
 get
 dates
 wrong
 using
 a


tool
 like
 this,
 you're
 going
 to
 get


really
 frustrated.
 I
 could
 at least


understand
 why
 time
 zone
 conversion,


maybe
 there
 was
 a
 UTC
 time
 stamp
 in
 the


Google
 API.
 I
 could
 at least
 understand


why
 this
 was
 happening
 and
 help
 guide
 it


towards
 a
 solution.
 But
 it
 certainly
 was


frustrating
 and
 something
 that
 I
 don't


think
 your
 everyday
 user
 would
 be
 able


to
 do.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 entertain
 you


all
 and
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell
 you
 as
 I


was
 doing
 this,
 um,
 I
 took
 a
 pause
 and
 I


took
 my
 two
 youngest
 kids
 to
 Target


because
 we
 were
 out
 of
 stuff.
 So,
 I


asked
 if
 it
 could
 discuss
 things
 with
 me


via
 voice
 and
 it
 said,
 "Sure,
 you
 can


send
 me
 voice
 notes.
 I
 can
 send
 text


back.
 I
 could
 send
 you
 voice
 notes
 back


or
 we
 could
 go
 through
 Twilio
 and
 I


could
 set
 up
 a
 phone
 call."
 I
 just
 said,


"Let's
 set
 up
 voice
 notes
 to
 your
 text


reply."
 And
 so
 I
 could
 um
 press
 voice
 on


Telegram
 and
 have
 it
 reply
 to
 me
 as
 I


was
 on
 the
 go.
 And
 so
 while
 we
 were
 in


this
 back
 and
 forth
 on
 um
 time
 zones,
 I


want
 to
 share
 with
 you
 my
 delightful


voice
 messages
 to
 Claudebot
 because
 this


was
 a
 real


real
 energy.
 Let's
 see
 if
 we
 can
 hear


them.
 Okay,
 so
 this
 is
 me


at
 Target
 pushing
 a
 cart
 getting
 really


mad
 at
 Claudebot.
 You
 put
 it
 back,
 but


that
 is
 a
 third
 a
 Friday.
 Friday
 is


correct
 date,
 so
 do
 not
 change
 anything,


but
 can
 you
 please
 explain
 to
 me
 why
 you


are
 getting
 days
 mixed
 up?
 This
 league


game
 is
 on
 the
 correct
 day.
 Again,


please
 do
 not
 change
 it,
 but
 I
 do
 not


understand
 why
 you
 have
 the
 days
 mixed


up.
 Okay,
 so
 I
 am
 getting
 super
 annoyed


by
 this
 um
 experience
 of
 getting
 days


wrong.
 And
 it
 replies,
 "Oh
 my
 gosh,
 you


are
 absolutely
 right.
 I
 see
 the
 problem


now.
 I
 was
 off
 by
 one
 day.
 Here's
 all


the
 new
 dates."
 And
 they
 were
 still


definitely
 off
 by
 one
 day.
 So
 once
 I


sent
 my
 mean
 mom
 message,
 it
 came
 back


with
 me
 and
 said,
 "You
 are
 absolutely


right.
 I
 apologize.
 Here
 are
 the
 dates."


Right.
 The
 issue
 is
 I've
 been,
 this
 is


fiery
 funny,
 I've
 been
 trying
 to
 quote


unquote
 mentally
 calculate
 which
 day
 of


the
 week
 each
 date
 falls
 on.
 Even
 though


the
 API
 is
 telling
 me
 what
 the
 date
 of


week
 is,
 I
 should
 probably
 trust
 it.
 But


I
 was
 using
 my
 LLM
 brain
 to
 decide.
 And


what
 did
 I
 say
 back
 to
 it?
 Well,
 I
 said


this.
 You
 are
 a
 computer.
 You
 are
 not


doing
 anything
 quote
 unquote
 mentally.


You
 are
 making
 calculations.
 Can
 you


look
 in
 your
 logs
 at
 all
 and
 understand


where
 the
 calculations
 come
 from
 or
 no?


And
 if
 you
 did
 not
 enjoy
 this,
 that
 is


my
 very,
 very
 new
 baby
 crying
 in
 the


background
 as
 I'm
 lifting
 him
 from
 the


car
 seat
 into
 the
 stroller.
 It
 was
 quite


an
 energy.
 And
 again,
 this
 is
 one
 of


those
 things
 that
 as
 a
 software


engineer,
 I
 get
 it.
 I
 have
 done
 time


zone
 conversions
 for
 my
 for
 for
 my
 whole


life.
 I
 understand
 the
 APIs
 return


things
 in
 all
 sorts
 of
 formats.
 I


understand
 LLMs
 can't
 do,
 you
 know,


basic
 math
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 dates.
 It's


just
 too
 hard.
 We
 do
 not
 have
 the


technology.


And
 yet,
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 model
 told


me
 it
 was
 doing
 it
 in
 his
 head
 was
 so


hilarious.
 So,
 once
 we
 had
 the
 back
 and


forth
 about
 this,
 it
 gave
 itself
 a
 rule


to
 follow
 in
 terms
 of
 getting
 these


dates
 right,
 and
 then
 I
 asked
 it
 to
 add


it
 to
 its
 rules.
 Now,
 the
 final
 thing


that
 we
 did
 is
 I
 asked
 if
 it
 could
 send


me
 voice
 notes
 back.
 And
 this
 is
 where


some
 of
 the
 magic
 of
 Clawbot
 really
 does


come
 out.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 people


have
 been
 saying
 about
 Claudebot
 that's


so
 cool
 is
 you
 can
 just
 get
 it
 can
 give


it
 self
 skills.
 It
 can
 learn
 things.
 It


can
 just
 do
 things
 very
 magically.
 And


if
 you
 were
 trying
 to
 get
 back
 and
 forth


voice
 notes
 in
 Telegram,
 it
 would
 have


been
 pretty
 hard
 to
 like
 figure
 out
 what


API
 you
 want
 to
 use
 and
 what
 skill
 and


hook
 it
 up
 and
 use
 cloud
 code,
 all
 this


stuff.
 And
 it
 just
 did
 it.
 So,
 when
 I


said,
 "Can
 you
 please
 send
 me
 voice


notes
 back?"
 It
 just
 sent
 me
 a
 voice


note
 back.
 So,
 let's
 see.


>> Yes,
 I
 can
 send
 voice
 messages
 back
 to


you.
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 you'd
 like
 me
 to
 use


voice
 for
 replies.
 I
 can
 do
 that
 anytime


you
 want.


>> So,
 that
 was
 a
 pretty
 magical
 moment.


And,
 you
 know,
 I've
 been
 giving


Claudebot
 a
 really
 hard
 time
 in
 in
 this


episode.
 Not
 because
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


an
 awesome
 product.
 The
 reality
 is
 going


back
 and
 forth
 via
 text
 with
 something


that
 has
 helpful
 access
 to
 your


calendar,
 has
 helpful
 access
 to
 your


email,
 can
 learn
 skills
 like
 voice
 that


you
 can
 just
 chitchat
 to.
 I
 actually


really
 liked
 the
 form
 factor
 of
 the


experience
 and
 I
 liked
 the
 concept
 of


what
 it
 could
 deliver.


It
 was
 just
 that
 the
 implementation
 of


it
 had
 a
 couple
 things.
 one,
 too


technical
 for
 the
 everyday
 user,
 two,


too
 scary
 to
 the
 security
 aware
 user,


and
 three,
 latency
 that
 took
 some
 of
 the


magic
 away
 from
 the
 experience.
 And
 so


again,
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 a
 bad


product


from
 a
 capital
 P
 product
 perspective.


I'm
 just
 not
 in
 love
 with
 the


implementation.
 And
 we'll
 just
 summarize


my
 what
 I
 did
 with
 Claudebot
 with
 my


last
 use
 case,
 which
 is
 I
 had
 Claudebot


use
 its
 history
 to
 create
 a
 Nex.js
 app


that
 showed
 the
 history
 of
 our


conversation.
 And
 I
 asked
 it
 to
 redact


names,
 numbers,
 URLs,
 email
 addresses,


all
 that
 stuff
 so
 I
 could
 share
 it
 with


all
 of
 you.
 Um,
 so
 again,
 kind
 of
 a


classic
 AI
 engineering
 AI
 coding
 vibe


coding
 use
 case.
 Now,
 the
 one
 thing
 that


I
 will
 say
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 are
 really


excited
 or
 say
 they're
 excited,
 I
 don't


know
 if
 they've
 used
 it,
 to
 use
 Cloudbot


to
 spin
 off
 Cloud
 Code
 to
 do
 coding
 for


them.
 And
 where
 this
 wasn't
 the
 magic


use
 case
 for
 me
 and
 why
 I
 didn't
 start


it
 is
 I've
 been
 spinning
 off
 remote


agents
 with
 computer
 access
 to
 do
 coding


for
 me
 for
 a
 while.
 I
 use
 Devon
 which


has
 a
 virtual
 machine
 in
 a
 local


environment
 and
 can
 spin
 up
 stuff
 access


to
 the
 web
 uh
 all
 the
 time.
 I
 use
 it


from
 Slack
 so
 I
 can
 appmention
 Devon.


You
 know
 I
 have
 a
 Slackbot
 for
 chat
 pd


so
 I'm
 apping
 my
 product
 manager
 all
 the


time.
 Cursor
 has
 background
 agents.
 You


know
 everything
 has
 you
 you
 codeex
 you


can
 kick
 off
 online.
 So
 I
 don't
 know
 if


people
 are
 just
 not
 using
 those
 tools.
 I


guess
 claude
 code
 um
 doesn't
 have
 have


one
 like
 that
 quite
 yet.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


people
 aren't
 using
 those
 tools,
 but


I've
 been
 coding
 by
 kicking
 off
 an


asynchronous
 teammate,
 quote
 unquote,


for,
 you
 know,
 two
 years
 now.
 And
 so


that
 piece
 was
 never
 what
 I
 wanted
 to


use
 Claudebot
 for.
 But
 I
 thought,
 you


got
 to
 vi
 code
 something
 when
 you're


trying
 a
 new
 agent.
 And
 I
 did
 that.
 So


what
 I
 did
 is
 I
 sent
 Polly
 the
 Claudebot


a
 voice
 note.
 And
 this
 is
 the


requirements
 I
 gave
 it.
 Okay,
 let's
 use


voice
 from
 here
 on
 out.
 I
 want
 you
 to


document
 our
 conversation
 in
 a
 next.js


JS
 web
 app
 that
 shows
 the
 back
 and
 forth


of
 our
 full
 conversation
 from
 the
 very


beginning
 today
 till
 the
 end
 in
 a
 UI.
 I


want
 you
 to
 redact
 anything
 that
 is
 a


secret
 key,
 a
 person's
 name
 or
 a


specific
 place.
 And
 I
 want
 to
 toggle


between
 two
 UI
 versions
 of
 this
 display.


I
 want
 you
 to
 be
 able
 to
 show
 me
 a


terminal
 style
 conversation
 back
 and


forth
 similar
 to
 a
 claude
 code
 or
 you


claude
 bot
 c
 l
 a
 w
 db
 b
 o
 t
 or
 I
 want


you
 to
 show
 me
 a
 telegram
 style
 text


back
 and
 forth.
 The
 content
 should
 be
 in


JSON
 the
 same
 again
 redact
 names,


emails,
 dates,
 etc.
 replace
 them
 with


placeholders
 or
 redacted
 blocks
 and
 then


generate
 the
 next
 JS
 app.
 I'm
 going
 to


use
 this
 so
 I
 can
 share
 this


conversation
 with
 others
 without
 sharing


my
 information
 or
 having
 to
 do
 a
 screen


recording.
 We
 are
 eventually
 going
 to


deploy
 this
 to
 Verscell.
 Can
 you
 let
 me


know
 when
 it's
 deployed
 to
 Versel
 so
 I


can
 look
 at
 it?
 So
 I
 sent
 it
 this


message
 and
 it
 kicked
 off
 local


development
 building
 a
 next.js
 app.
 Now,


when
 I
 got
 back
 to
 my
 laptop
 that
 Claude


was
 running
 on,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I


noticed
 is
 deploying
 it
 actually
 wasn't


that
 simple.
 Claudebot
 didn't
 have
 a


GitHub
 account.
 Claudebot
 I
 didn't


really
 want
 to
 add
 to
 my
 Versell


account.
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 log
 into
 those


things.
 It
 seemed
 like
 a
 big


rigomearroll.
 And
 so,
 getting
 it
 to


deploy


without
 having
 to
 set
 up
 a
 bunch
 of


accounts
 seemed
 not
 fun.
 So
 what
 I
 did


instead,
 don't
 tell
 anybody,
 is
 I
 air


dropped
 the
 repo
 to
 my
 own
 laptop
 here.


I
 actually
 logged
 into
 Claude
 Code
 and


made
 some
 edits.
 And
 to
 be
 honest,
 in


terms
 of
 coding
 quality
 and
 just
 the


back
 and
 forth
 with
 the
 latency
 of


Claudebot
 and
 the
 inability
 to
 sort
 of


see
 what
 decisions
 it's
 making
 from
 a


coding
 perspective,
 I
 didn't
 love


Claudebot
 Telegram
 vibe
 coding.
 It's


just
 too
 slow.
 the
 cycles
 aren't
 good


enough,
 they
 aren't
 incremental
 enough,


it's
 clearly
 not
 like
 perfectly
 tuned


for
 the
 coding
 use
 case.
 It's
 not
 like


sending
 me
 a
 PR
 link,
 all
 those
 sorts
 of


things.
 And
 so
 I
 just
 preferred
 working


with
 it
 on
 my
 desktop
 in
 claw
 code
 and


deploying
 it
 through
 my
 normal
 system.


So
 that's
 a
 little
 bit
 feedback
 there.


One
 thing
 that
 I
 did
 think
 was
 really


cool
 is
 when
 I
 was
 on
 my
 go
 on
 the
 go


and
 it
 said
 the
 app
 was
 ready,
 you
 know,


I
 was
 in
 Target
 or
 whatever
 and
 I
 wasn't


at
 a
 place
 where
 I
 could
 run
 a
 local


machine.
 It
 was
 pretty
 cool
 to
 say,
 hey,


like
 shoot
 me
 a
 screenshot
 of
 what
 it


looks
 like
 and
 it
 did
 it
 shot
 me


screenshots
 of
 what
 the
 app
 looked
 like


directly
 in
 Telegram.
 So,
 I
 do
 think


there's
 some
 underappreciated
 aspects,


really
 simple
 things.
 Email
 me
 that


file,
 share
 me
 a
 screenshot
 that
 are


really
 useful
 to
 interface
 with
 a
 a


laptop
 or
 a
 desktop
 or
 a
 device
 at
 home.


So,
 I
 do
 think
 this
 is
 an


underappreciated
 aspect
 of
 being
 able
 to


chat
 with
 your
 computer.
 It
 can
 do


things
 like
 send
 you
 files,
 take


screenshots,
 open
 up
 browsers.
 That
 is


pretty
 cool,
 especially
 since
 we
 don't


store
 everything
 in
 the
 cloud.
 All
 my


desktop
 screenshots
 are
 not
 in
 the


cloud.
 some
 of
 the
 PDFs
 that
 I
 download


are
 not
 in
 the
 cloud.
 And
 so
 this
 is


this
 was
 a
 really
 kind
 of
 like
 fun
 use


case
 for
 chatting
 with
 a
 remote


developer.
 Now,
 that
 being
 said,
 Devon


sends
 me
 screenshots
 all
 the
 time.
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 perfect
 for
 coding,
 but


it's
 something
 to
 think
 about.
 So,
 I


want
 to
 end
 this
 workflow
 section
 with


one
 workflow
 that
 I
 thought
 it
 did
 a


particularly
 good
 job
 at.
 And
 it
 was


good
 for
 two
 reasons.
 One,
 the
 product


interface
 was
 what
 I
 wanted.
 I
 got
 the


full
 Claudebot
 bot
 experience.
 The


second
 thing
 was
 the
 output
 was
 really


good.
 So
 what
 did
 I
 ask
 it
 to
 do?
 Well,


I
 asked
 Claudebot
 to
 go
 on
 Reddit
 and


research
 what
 people
 would
 want
 from


Chat
 PD.
 So
 I
 said
 go
 on
 Reddit.
 I
 I
 did


this
 during
 voice
 note.
 I
 said
 go
 on


Reddit,
 find
 what
 people
 want
 from
 Chat


PR,
 find
 what
 they
 want
 from
 a
 product


AI
 platform
 and
 email
 me
 a
 report.
 And


what
 did
 I
 love
 about
 the
 product


experience?
 One
 of
 the
 killer
 features


of
 Cladbot
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 message


anywhere,
 anything,
 anyhow.
 I
 sent
 it
 to


voice
 note.
 I
 could
 shoot
 it
 an
 email.
 I


could
 text
 if
 that
 was
 faster.
 And
 it


would
 reply
 in
 kind
 as
 text,
 as
 voice,


whatever.
 And
 it
 would
 also
 email
 me.


So,
 it
 felt
 very
 much
 like
 an
 employee


that
 I
 was
 working
 with.
 Hey,
 like
 send


them
 a
 Slack.
 And
 they're
 like,
 yep,


it's
 in
 your
 inbox.
 That
 sort
 of
 always


on
 anywhere
 anyhow
 communication
 flow


for
 the
 agent
 was
 really
 really
 nice.


The
 second
 thing
 I
 like
 from
 a
 product


perspective
 is
 I've
 talked
 about
 this


from
 a
 negative
 point
 of
 view
 which
 is


the
 latency
 is
 not
 great.
 It's
 just
 not


super
 responsive
 and
 super
 fast
 and
 it's


kind
 of
 broken
 sometimes.
 But
 if
 this
 is


a
 research
 task
 that
 I
 don't
 really


think
 should
 come
 back
 quickly,
 I
 don't


mind
 waiting
 for
 Claudebot
 to
 do
 a
 good


job.
 And
 it
 did.
 And
 it's
 very
 similar


to
 an
 experience
 with
 an
 employee.
 if
 I


give
 them
 sort
 of
 a
 research
 task
 or


roadmap
 task,
 I
 don't
 expect
 it
 to
 be


returned
 in
 30
 seconds
 except
 they
 go


out,
 do
 a
 bunch
 of
 research
 and
 come


back
 to
 me
 and
 so
 I
 wasn't
 as
 bothered


by
 the
 latency
 here.
 And
 then
 the
 third


thing
 is
 I
 thought
 the
 output
 was


actually
 quite
 good.
 So,
 I'll
 show
 you


what
 it
 sent
 me,
 which
 is
 it
 sent
 me


this
 chat
 Reddit
 research
 markdown


document,
 emailed
 it
 to
 my
 inbox,
 and
 it


listed
 out
 key
 insights
 from
 research


Reddit
 from
 researching
 Reddit.
 And
 what


I
 thought
 was
 awesome
 is
 this
 is
 right,


but
 it's
 presented
 in
 a
 really
 simple,


punchy
 way
 that
 I
 can
 go
 action.
 this
 is


exactly
 how
 I
 would
 want
 a
 PM
 or
 a


research
 assistant
 on
 my
 team
 to
 come


back
 with
 insights
 and
 these
 are
 the


things
 that
 we
 hear.
 So,
 it
 was
 really


accurate.
 You
 know,
 integration


limitations
 both
 on
 our
 side
 and


customer
 sites
 hard.
 No
 one
 reads
 long


PRDs.
 Let's
 make
 our
 PRDS
 shorter.
 Um,


you
 know,
 PRDs
 need
 to
 be
 living


documents.
 All
 these
 things,
 a
 couple


bullet
 points,
 a
 couple
 reference
 links


to
 Reddit
 threads.
 And
 I
 have
 a
 full


document
 that
 I
 can
 go
 build
 a
 road
 map


off
 of.
 And
 in
 fact,
 that's
 exactly
 what


I
 asked
 it
 to
 do.
 I
 said,
 go
 build
 a


road
 map
 based
 on
 this.
 look
 at
 our


current
 functionality
 and
 tell
 me
 what
 I


should
 build
 next.
 This
 felt
 pretty


magic.
 I'm
 probably
 going
 to
 steal
 some


of
 these
 ideas.
 I'm
 going
 to
 circle


around
 to
 that
 in
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 terms


of
 what
 I
 think
 is
 next
 for
 Claudebot.


But
 I
 do
 think
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be


demand
 both
 from
 a
 consumer
 perspective


and
 from
 an
 enterprise
 business


perspective
 on
 a
 agent
 employee
 that


feels
 like
 an
 agent
 employee.
 It
 has
 a


computer.
 It
 has
 account
 access.
 It
 can


do
 things.
 It
 does
 those
 things
 well.


But
 I
 think
 there
 are
 some
 things
 we're


going
 to
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 first
 before


we
 let
 it
 loose.
 And
 again,
 you
 can
 see


this
 here.
 I
 asked
 it
 to
 do
 a
 road
 map.


It
 totally
 just
 didn't
 do
 it.
 It
 forgot


it.
 Said,
 "Let
 me
 check
 on
 the


background
 agent."
 Then
 never
 replied.


So
 again,
 we're
 hitting
 some,
 you
 know,


sharp
 edges
 on
 the
 product
 experience.


It's
 not
 perfect,
 but
 it
 is
 pretty


interesting.
 So
 what
 have
 I
 showed
 you


so
 far?
 One,
 I
 have
 told
 you
 a
 little


bit
 at
 a
 high
 level
 what
 Claudebot
 is.


Although
 I
 haven't
 gone
 into
 all
 the


detail
 about
 how
 it
 works,
 not
 really


the
 point
 of
 this
 episode.
 I've
 showed


how
 to
 onboard
 with
 Claudebot,
 including


how
 to
 connect
 Telegram
 to
 chat
 back
 and


forth
 with
 it
 on
 text
 or
 voice.
 I've


showed
 you
 how
 I
 give
 access
 to
 its
 own


Gmail
 workspace
 account
 as
 well
 as
 one


password
 so
 it
 can
 interact
 with
 limited


scope
 to
 my
 data.
 I've
 given
 you
 some


warnings
 about
 what
 you
 should
 think


about
 in
 terms
 of
 scope
 and
 access


there.
 I've
 gone
 through
 a
 couple


workflows,
 couple
 admin
 workflows,
 which


are
 simple
 calendar
 all
 the
 way
 to


advanced
 calendar
 management.
 Did
 not
 do


well
 because
 it
 doesn't
 have
 a
 good


sense
 of
 time
 and
 space,
 but
 hopefully


we'll
 figure
 that
 out.
 As
 software


engineers
 overall,
 I
 asked
 it
 to
 contact


partners
 and
 guests
 by
 email.
 It
 did
 not


a
 great
 job
 there
 because
 it
 lost
 a


sense
 of
 its
 own
 identity.
 I
 had
 it
 do


vibe
 coding,
 which
 it
 did
 a
 fine
 job
 at,


but
 is
 definitely
 not
 my
 favorite
 tool


for
 AI
 engineering
 remotely
 and


asynchronously.
 And
 then
 finally,
 I


showed
 you
 my
 favorite
 use
 case
 was
 for


it
 to
 do
 some
 complex
 research
 and


analysis
 with
 tools
 with
 web.
 And
 it
 did


a
 really
 good
 job
 and
 came
 back
 with


came
 back
 to
 me
 with
 something
 that
 I


really
 like.
 Now,
 one
 thing
 that
 I


didn't
 go
 check
 that
 I'm
 going
 to
 go


check
 next
 is
 did
 it
 teach
 itself
 all


these
 skills?
 Was
 it
 really
 telling
 me


the
 truth
 when
 it
 said
 it
 had
 rules?
 A


peak
 under
 the
 hood,
 which
 I
 will


probably
 do
 as
 a
 follow-up
 either
 on
 X


or
 here
 on
 the
 podcast.
 Like,
 how
 does


this
 thing
 work
 behind
 the
 scenes?
 That


was
 not
 the
 point
 of
 this
 episode.
 The


point
 of
 this
 episode
 was
 to
 show
 how


somebody
 would
 come
 with
 a
 blank
 idea,


maybe
 a
 fresh
 Mac
 Mini,
 install
 this


thing
 from
 the
 command
 line,
 and


actually
 get
 it
 to
 do
 things.
 And
 I


think
 I
 showed
 you
 it's
 good
 at
 some


things,
 bad
 at
 others,
 and
 scary
 across


the
 board.
 So,
 let's
 get
 to
 my
 final


thoughts
 here,
 which
 are
 basically
 that


and
 and
 I
 shared
 this
 on
 X.
 But
 the


whole
 time
 I
 was
 doing
 Claudebot,
 the


whole
 time
 I
 was
 using
 this,
 I
 thought


two
 things.
 One,
 this
 is
 so
 scary.
 This


is
 a
 terrible
 idea.
 Nobody
 should
 be


doing
 this.
 It
 should
 not
 have
 access
 to


all
 this
 stuff
 on
 my
 computer.
 I
 should


not
 be
 sharing
 these
 keys
 locally.
 I


should
 not
 let
 LLMs
 have
 access
 to
 Gmail


OOTH,
 even
 if
 it's
 a
 sandbox
 app.
 I
 was


like,
 "No,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no,
 no.
 SOS.


Don't
 love
 it."
 As
 I
 said,
 this
 is
 the


final
 boss
 of
 security
 training.
 You


should
 be
 very
 careful
 about
 what
 you


give
 it
 access
 to.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 I'm
 most
 concerned
 about
 is


probably
 you
 get
 the
 most
 power
 from


Claudebot
 if
 you
 give
 it
 access
 to
 your


actual
 inbox,
 to
 your
 actual
 calendar,


to
 your
 actual
 documents,
 to
 your
 actual


repositories,
 your
 actual
 GitHub.
 And
 I


can
 imagine


so
 many
 things
 going
 wrong
 with
 that.


Just
 knowing
 how
 it's
 built,
 which
 it's


built
 in
 an
 awesome
 way.
 I
 think
 Pete's


done
 an
 incredible
 job.
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 any
 ill
 will
 or
 mal
 intent
 in


how
 it's
 built.
 It's
 powerful.
 It


self-learns.
 It
 installs
 skills.
 It
 asks


for
 permission.
 It's
 pretty
 independent.


All
 that
 stuff
 is
 great
 until
 you
 have


full
 readr
 access
 to
 your
 most
 personal


information.
 And
 one
 of the
 things
 that


I
 was
 thinking
 as
 I
 was,
 you
 know,


preparing
 for
 the
 show
 is
 great,
 I
 just


gave
 an
 autonomous
 AI
 agent
 access
 to


where
 my
 kids
 basketball
 practices
 are.


Like
 is
 that
 something
 like
 do
 we
 want


to
 selfdoc


um
 AI
 crustation?
 Probably
 not.
 So
 I


think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the


challenges
 of
 this
 product
 because
 the


second
 feeling
 I
 had
 was
 boy
 oh
 boy,
 I


want
 this
 thing.
 I
 want
 AI
 that
 I
 can


text.
 I
 want
 AI
 that
 does
 not
 make
 it


complicated
 to
 talk
 back
 and
 forth
 with


voice.
 I
 want
 AI
 that
 when
 I
 say,
 "Hey,


can
 you
 look
 at
 my
 CRM?"
 doesn't
 say,


"Go
 to
 this
 web
 page
 and
 press
 this


button
 and
 enter
 this
 API
 key
 and
 do


this
 and
 that."
 I
 just
 want
 it
 to
 happen


automatically.
 I
 want
 all
 that.


I
 just
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 it
 yet.
 Like


this
 does
 not
 feel
 yet
 like
 the


interface
 to
 get
 me
 there.
 And
 so
 I
 have


this
 real
 tension
 between
 I
 think
 the


product
 from
 product
 experience
 isn't


quite
 there
 yet.
 It's
 not
 really
 for
 the


non-technical.
 So
 it
 really
 is
 for


tinkerers
 and
 hackers.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


security
 stuff
 here
 that's
 super
 scary.


And
 can
 I
 have
 it
 please?
 And
 so
 maybe


this
 is
 an
 example
 of
 something
 that


from
 a
 market
 category
 perspective


definitely
 has
 product
 market
 fit.
 There


are
 gajillions
 of
 dollars
 to
 make
 here.


I
 just
 don't
 know
 if
 this
 open-
 source


YOLO
 mode
 terminal
 tool
 is
 is
 the
 thing.


And
 in
 fact,
 I'm
 gonna
 take,
 you
 know,


this
 laptop
 soon
 and
 office
 space
 it.


Um,
 for
 those
 of
 you
 that
 are
 very


young,
 that
 means
 I'm
 going to
 go
 like


hit
 it
 with
 sledgehammer.
 But
 like,
 I'm


going
 to
 uninstall
 it.
 I'm
 going
 to


remove
 those
 keys.
 I'm
 going
 to
 delete


the
 Telegram
 B.
 Like,
 I
 don't
 like
 this.


This
 makes
 me
 nervous.
 And
 I'm
 also


going
 to
 go
 build
 one
 for
 myself.
 And
 so


I
 think
 there
 is
 why
 there
 has
 been
 such


a
 zeitgeist
 around
 this
 product
 is
 it
 is


actually
 really
 cool
 to
 be
 able
 to
 chat


voice
 whatever
 a
 very
 smart


self-sufficient
 agent
 and
 hackers
 see
 it


and
 they're
 also
 you
 know
 more
 risk


tolerance
 than
 the
 everyday
 person.
 But


that
 being
 said,
 like
 husband,
 please


don't
 connect
 your
 Gmail
 to
 this.
 Like


mom,
 absolutely
 not.
 Like
 kids,
 stay


away.
 Not
 not
 safe
 for
 kids.
 Like
 this


is
 just
 this
 is
 something
 that
 unless


you
 have
 been
 through
 a
 security


tabletop
 exercise
 and
 know
 what
 to
 know.


Um
 I
 would
 just
 be
 really
 cautious
 about


how
 permissive
 you
 are
 in
 terms
 of


access.
 And
 that
 leads
 me
 to
 my
 final


final
 question
 of
 this
 episode,
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 Claude
 will
 live


in
 our
 hearts
 forever.
 And
 in
 fact,
 it's


probably
 got
 a
 great
 feature
 in
 front
 of


it.
 I
 love
 how
 fast
 the
 team
 is
 going,


Claudebot.
 But
 who's
 going
 to
 build
 this


thing
 for
 real?
 Like,
 who
 is
 actually


going
 to
 build
 this
 thing
 for
 real?
 Who


is
 going
 to
 build
 the
 consumer
 version


of
 it?
 Who
 is
 going
 to
 build
 the


enterprise
 version
 of
 it?
 Who
 is
 going


to
 get
 it
 right?
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a


complicated
 question,
 and
 I'm
 just
 going


to
 pose
 some
 thoughts
 as
 we
 close
 out


this
 episode.
 You
 know,
 this
 should
 be


Google
 or
 Microsoft's
 game
 to
 lose.


Maybe
 even
 Metas
 on
 the
 consumer
 side,


but
 this
 should
 be
 Google
 or
 Microsoft's


game
 to
 lose.
 Like,
 they
 have
 the
 data,


they
 have
 your
 Gmail,
 they
 have
 your


calendar,
 they
 have
 documents,
 they
 have


the
 models.
 The
 models
 are
 exceptional.


They
 just
 got
 to
 build
 the,
 you
 know,


they
 have
 devices.
 um
 Android,
 they
 just


have
 to
 build
 the
 product
 experience
 and


have
 the
 sort
 of
 institutional
 fortitude


and
 um
 close
 your
 eyes
 legal
 team
 to


allow
 some
 of
 this
 to
 happen
 because
 I


think
 it's
 a
 really
 cool
 product
 built


on
 top
 of
 the
 Google
 ecosystem.
 I
 mean,


I
 think
 the
 same
 on
 the
 enterprise
 from


a
 Microsoft
 perspective.
 If
 Copilot
 did


this,
 this
 is
 pretty
 incredible.


That
 being
 said,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 those


companies
 are
 going
 to
 have
 the
 velocity


or
 the
 bravery
 to
 go
 as
 yolo
 as
 Cloudbot


did.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we're
 going to


get
 there
 with
 the
 big
 companies.
 On
 the


flip
 side,
 you
 see
 Cloudbot
 open
 source,


great
 for
 hackers,
 but
 super
 scary.
 Um,


giving
 like
 API
 key
 and
 OOTH
 access.


Smaller
 companies,
 startups
 are
 going
 to


see
 this
 and
 want
 to
 build
 this.
 And
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 would


warn
 startups,
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 build


on
 top
 of
 these
 data
 sources
 for
 real


because
 Google
 doesn't
 want
 to
 give
 you


read,
 write,
 go,
 do
 everything
 access
 to


their
 data.
 Microsoft
 does
 not.
 You
 have


to
 go
 through
 these
 compliance
 hoops
 and


approvals
 and
 um
 reviews.
 And
 so
 while
 I


love
 the
 idea
 of
 a
 do
 everything,
 do


anything
 bot,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


complicated
 from
 a
 product
 builder


perspective.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


complicated
 from
 a
 large
 company


perspective.
 who
 gets
 the
 data
 and
 then


again
 like
 is
 Apple
 gonna
 get
 in
 this


game?
 This
 is
 just
 what
 everybody
 wants


from
 Siri
 to
 do.
 Siri
 has
 all
 your
 apps,


all
 your
 access
 but
 again
 it's
 a


combination
 of
 product
 building
 skills


and
 um
 risk
 tolerance
 I
 think
 and


willingness
 to
 experiment.


Maybe
 anthropic
 and
 open
 AI
 come
 in.


Maybe
 we
 get
 our
 open
 AI
 OS
 and


workspace
 tools
 and
 maybe
 we
 get
 cla


um
 we
 get
 some
 new
 versions
 of
 this.


It'll
 just
 be
 really
 interesting
 to
 see


how
 this
 shakes
 out.
 So,
 in
 conclusion,


what
 are
 my
 thoughts
 about
 Clawbot?
 It


is
 scary.
 It
 is
 fun.
 Um,
 it
 does
 some


things
 really,
 really
 well.
 It
 is
 really


interesting
 from
 a
 interface
 perspective


and
 it
 doesn't
 always
 work.
 And
 I'm
 not


sure
 it's
 for
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say


everyone,
 but
 I'm
 not
 sure
 it's
 for
 for


anyone
 right
 now
 except
 for
 people
 who


are
 really
 willing
 to
 roll
 the
 dice
 with


their
 AI
 bot.
 That
 being
 said,
 if
 you're


willing
 to
 do
 that,
 the
 way
 this
 has


been
 built,
 the
 way
 it
 self-discover


skills,
 the
 way
 it
 stores
 its
 memory,


the
 way
 it
 gives
 itself
 access
 is
 really


interesting
 and
 should
 inspire
 a
 lot
 of


product
 builders
 thinking
 about
 AI


products
 on
 what
 the
 interface
 of
 the


future
 is.
 I
 think
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be


seeing
 and
 hearing
 a
 lot
 more
 about


agents
 like
 this.
 I
 am
 going
 to
 be


giving
 you
 my
 honest
 takes
 about
 where


they
 are
 now
 and
 where
 they're
 going
 to


be
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 in
 the
 meantime,


I'm
 going
 to
 go
 execute
 Polly
 the


Clawbot.
 Thanks,
 and
 I'll
 see
 you
 next


time
 on
 How
 I
 AI.
