We're
 going
 to
 start
 with
 something
 that


we
 haven't
 actually
 seen
 on
 how
 I
 AI


yet,
 which
 is
 agent
 mode
 in
 chat
 GBT.


>> My
 use
 case
 was
 with
 our
 hiring
 team.


Part
 of
 their
 workflow
 is
 to
 browse


through
 many
 LinkedIn
 profile
 and
 search


for
 relevant
 candidates.
 It
 takes
 a
 lot


of
 time.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 prompt.
 I'd
 love


for
 you
 to
 go
 through
 how
 you
 thought


about
 structuring
 it
 to
 make
 it


effective
 with
 the
 agent.


>> I
 want
 a
 little
 helper.
 I'm
 a
 recruiter.


I
 want
 someone
 who
 is
 like
 me.
 So,
 I


started
 by
 telling
 it
 you're
 an
 ID


recruiter.
 And
 then
 I
 described
 what
 I


wanted
 to
 do.
 I
 love
 that
 you
 called
 it


your
 little
 helper
 because
 don't
 we
 all


want
 an
 AI
 little
 helper?


[music]


Welcome
 back
 to
 How
 I
 AI.
 I'm
 Clarva,


product
 leader
 and
 AI
 obsessive
 here
 on


a
 mission
 to
 help
 you
 build
 better
 with


these
 new
 tools.
 Today
 I
 have
 Mihal
 Pled


[music]
 from
 Honeybook,
 their
 technical


operations
 engineer
 who's
 building
 tons


of
 internal
 tools
 and
 automations
 to


[music]
 make
 their
 team's
 life
 easier


and
 reduce
 friction.
 Miha
 is
 going
 to


show
 us
 some
 advanced
 features
 of
 Chat


GBT,
 including
 agent
 mode,
 replicate
 not


one
 but
 five
 of
 their
 personas
 as
 AI


identities,
 and
 save
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on


my
 commute
 using
 Chat
 GBT.
 I'm
 really


excited
 about
 this
 episode.
 Let's


[music]
 get
 to
 it.
 This
 episode
 is


brought
 to
 you
 by
 Brex.
 If
 you're


listening
 to
 this
 show,
 you
 already
 know


[music]
 AI
 is
 changing
 how
 we
 work
 in


real
 practical
 ways.
 Brex
 is
 bringing


that
 same
 power
 to
 finance.
 Brex
 [music]


is
 the
 intelligent
 finance
 platform


built
 for
 founders.
 With
 autonomous


agents
 running
 in
 the
 [music]


background,
 your
 finance
 stack
 basically


runs
 itself.
 Cards
 are
 issued,
 expenses


are
 filed,
 and
 fraud
 is
 stopped
 in
 real


time
 without
 you
 having
 to
 think
 about


it.
 Add
 Brex's
 banking
 solution
 with
 a


high
 yield
 treasury
 account,
 and
 you've


got
 a
 system
 that
 helps
 you
 spend


smarter,
 [music]


move
 faster,
 and
 scale
 with
 confidence.


One
 in
 three
 startups
 in
 the
 [music]
 US


already
 runs
 on
 Brex.
 You
 can
 too
 at


bre.com/howi


ai.
 Mihal,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 joining


How
 I
 AI.
 I'm
 excited
 to
 see
 what
 you


have
 to
 share.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.


>> We're
 gonna
 start
 with
 something
 that
 we


haven't
 actually
 seen
 on
 how
 I
 AI
 yet,


which
 is
 agent
 mode
 in
 chat
 GBT.
 And
 so


I'm
 wondering
 if
 you
 can
 just
 go
 ahead


and
 dive
 into
 what
 was
 the
 problem
 that


you
 were
 trying
 to
 solve
 and
 why
 was


this
 agent
 mode,
 this
 agentic
 browsing


the
 solution
 to
 the
 problem
 you're


having?
 Our
 problem
 was
 um
 you
 know
 same


as
 same
 as
 our
 customers
 are
 having.
 Uh


you
 have
 to
 do
 your
 job.
 You
 have
 a
 job


that
 you
 really
 love
 doing
 and
 you
 have


your
 proficiencies
 and
 and
 expertise.


However,
 you
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 your
 time


doing
 the
 the
 um
 mundane
 thoughtless


uh
 manual
 repeating
 work
 in
 order
 to
 do


uh
 to
 get
 the
 information
 that
 you
 need.


So
 my
 use
 case
 was
 with
 our
 hiring
 team


and
 as
 a
 recruiter
 when
 you
 get
 a
 job


description
 that
 you
 need
 to
 recruit
 to


find
 candidates
 for
 part
 of
 their
 part


of
 their
 uh
 workflow
 is
 to
 uh
 browse


through
 uh
 many
 LinkedIn
 profile
 and


search
 for
 uh
 relevant
 candidates
 that


may
 be
 uh
 relevant
 for
 the
 job


descriptions
 and
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of
 time


can
 be
 hours
 of
 browsing
 through


profiles
 and
 going
 through
 all
 of
 the


characteristics
 that
 they're
 looking


for.
 So
 I
 wanted
 to
 take
 that
 load
 off


of
 them
 and
 uh
 Chad
 GPT
 agent
 mode
 came


just
 in
 time.
 We
 all
 talk
 about
 what


agent
 is
 and
 what
 agents
 do
 and
 how
 we


can
 use
 them
 in
 chat.
 It's
 very
 uh


simple
 to
 understand.
 So
 you
 just
 open
 a


chat
 with
 chatgpt
 but
 then
 you
 add
 an


instruction
 and
 turn
 it
 into
 an
 agent


mode
 very
 simply
 from
 the
 toolbar.
 And


once
 it
 goes
 into
 agent
 mode,
 it
 means


that
 it
 can
 take
 the
 prompt
 or
 you
 can


actually
 use
 specific
 prompts
 to
 tell
 it


not
 just
 to
 search
 for
 information


online
 but
 also
 to
 perform
 actions
 for


you.
 And
 why
 did
 I
 need
 it
 in
 this
 case?


Because
 I
 needed
 to
 log
 into
 LinkedIn.
 I


don't
 want
 it
 to
 just
 search
 for


profiles
 uh
 on
 LinkedIn
 just
 just


profiles
 that
 are
 publicly
 accessible.


That's
 not
 the
 information
 that
 I
 need.


So,
 I
 needed
 it
 to
 log
 into
 LinkedIn
 and


I
 needed
 it
 to
 perform
 search
 and
 I


needed
 it
 to
 go
 through
 the
 profiles
 and


and
 look
 for
 the
 restrictions
 that
 I


want
 to
 give
 it.
 And
 those
 restrictions


were
 provided
 by
 the
 actual
 uh
 hiring


team
 that
 they
 actually
 use
 it
 as
 uh


requirements
 for
 potential
 candidates


that
 they
 find.


>> Yeah.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 the
 the
 prompt


really
 quickly
 because
 I
 think
 this


prompt
 is
 is
 interesting
 as
 I'm
 reading


it.
 And
 I'd
 love
 for
 you
 to
 go
 through


how
 you
 thought
 about
 structuring
 it
 to


make
 it
 effective
 with
 the
 agent.


>> Of
 course.
 So
 I
 usually
 start
 my
 prompts


uh
 begin
 my
 prompts
 with
 telling
 the
 GPT


its
 role.
 And
 so
 here
 I
 told
 it
 you
 are


an
 IT
 recruiter.
 I
 want
 a
 little
 helper,


right?
 I'm
 a
 recruiter.
 I
 want
 someone


who
 is
 like
 me
 that
 will
 will
 assist
 me


with
 my
 job.
 So
 I
 started
 by
 telling
 it


you're
 an
 ID
 recruiter.
 And
 then
 I


described
 what
 I
 wanted
 to
 do,
 what
 the


task
 is.
 Log
 to
 LinkedIn
 using
 my


account.
 If
 not
 already
 logged
 in,
 let


me
 take
 control
 and
 log
 in.
 It
 is


something
 that
 is
 possible.
 Find
 up
 to


five
 LinkedIn
 profiles
 where
 the
 current


title
 and
 job
 description
 match
 the


attached
 job
 description.
 Uh
 and
 here
 is


the
 part
 where
 I
 just
 uploaded
 uh
 job


description.
 In
 this
 case,
 it's
 for
 an


engineering
 role.
 Okay.
 Um
 so
 I
 have
 the


job
 description
 and
 I
 have
 the
 um
 uh
 you


are
 an
 IT
 recruiter.
 This
 is
 your
 job.


This
 is
 the
 task
 and
 I
 provide
 like
 a


full
 description
 of
 the
 task
 actually


actually
 describing
 what
 an
 actual
 IT


recruiter
 would
 do
 and
 then
 I
 added


restrictions
 or
 special
 instructions.
 It


doesn't
 matter
 matter
 how
 you
 call
 them


but
 these
 are
 important
 because
 these


give
 don't
 just
 search
 for
 something


that
 matches
 the
 description.
 Do
 it
 the


way
 that
 we
 do
 it.
 And
 when
 our
 hiring


team
 goes
 into
 a
 search,
 they
 have


specific
 criteria
 that
 they
 go
 for.
 So
 I


collected
 these
 and
 and
 I
 added
 it
 as
 a


list
 as
 a
 restriction.
 I
 could
 call
 it


instructions.
 It
 would
 would
 have
 been


the
 same.
 So
 candidates
 must
 be
 from


Israel
 because
 the
 job
 is
 being
 filled


up
 in
 Israel
 or
 currently
 working
 at
 an


Israeli
 company
 and
 they
 must
 be
 active


in
 LinkedIn
 uh
 within
 the
 last
 3
 months


because
 that's
 something
 that
 our
 hiring


team
 is
 looking
 for.
 uh
 and
 the
 current


job
 role
 must
 be
 close
 enough
 to
 the
 uh


open
 role
 and
 in
 title
 and
 seniority
 and


uh
 also
 something
 that
 is
 special
 uh
 the


candidates
 must
 either
 work
 in
 their


current
 workspace
 more
 than
 a
 year
 or


they
 can
 be
 unemployed
 but
 no
 more
 than


a
 year
 uh
 and
 have
 worked
 in
 their
 last


workplace
 for
 over
 a
 year.
 These
 are
 all


things,
 but
 I
 I
 didn't
 invent
 them.
 They


were
 taken
 specifically
 from
 our
 iron


process.


>> What
 I
 love
 about
 this
 is
 exactly
 what


you
 said,
 which
 is
 I
 first
 I
 love
 that


you
 called
 it
 your
 little
 helper
 because


don't
 we
 all
 want
 an
 AI
 little
 helper?


That
 is
 that
 is
 my
 goal.
 Maybe
 I'll


rebrand
 my
 product
 to
 just
 little


helper.
 Um,
 but
 what
 I
 like
 about
 this


is,
 you
 know,
 it
 when
 you're
 building
 a


a
 tool
 like
 this
 or
 a
 prompt
 like
 this,


the
 simplest
 way
 to
 get
 to
 a
 good


outcome
 is
 simply
 interview
 somebody
 and


say
 step
 by
 step,
 just
 tell
 me
 what
 you


do.
 Like,
 tell
 me
 what
 you
 do.
 And
 if


you
 can
 codify
 what
 a
 person's


step-by-step
 workflow
 is
 and
 you
 can
 put


that
 into
 a
 pretty
 simple
 prompt,
 which


here
 it's
 only
 a
 paragraph
 and,
 you


know,
 three
 or
 four
 bullet
 points,
 you


can
 replicate
 and
 automate
 that
 at


scale.
 And
 typically,


this
 is
 not
 the
 highest
 order
 thinking


you
 want
 your
 recruiter
 or
 sourcer
 to


do.
 You
 don't
 want
 them
 just
 to
 build
 a


list
 and
 be
 looking
 is
 this
 person
 here


a
 year
 or
 not.
 that
 is
 an
 input
 to
 what


you
 hope
 is
 a
 great
 recruiting
 process,


great
 outreach,
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


So,
 one,
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 really
 great


to
 interview
 your
 colleagues
 and
 say,


"How
 do
 you
 do
 your
 job
 and
 what
 parts


do
 you
 hate
 and
 let
 me
 automate
 them?"


The
 second
 piece
 that
 I
 think
 is
 really


interesting
 here
 is
 you're
 actually


pretty
 specific
 about
 a
 couple
 outcomes.


You're
 specific
 about
 the
 number
 of


candidates
 that
 you
 want.
 So,
 I
 think


that's
 really
 helpful.
 you're
 specific


about
 a
 kind
 of
 um
 threshold
 of
 matching


your
 criteria.
 So
 you
 say
 70%
 and
 I


often
 find
 these
 LLMs
 are
 very
 you
 know


what
 is
 70%
 matching
 like
 it's
 not
 it's


not
 pure
 science
 but
 they're
 pretty
 good


at
 at
 following
 a
 general
 threshold.
 So


I
 think
 that
 is
 really
 interesting.
 And


then
 the
 last
 piece
 I
 want
 to
 call
 out


which
 we'll
 maybe
 see
 in
 the
 demo
 is


agent
 while
 it
 can
 be
 agentic
 and


independent
 can
 also
 be
 a
 co-pilot
 and


collaborator.
 And
 so
 you
 actually


instruct
 the
 agent
 when
 you're
 going
 to


take
 over
 and
 when
 they're
 going
 to
 take


over.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 is
 also
 really


interesting
 things
 for
 folks
 to
 know
 is


you
 don't
 just
 have
 to
 like
 press
 the


button
 and
 walk
 away
 and
 let
 the
 agent


run.
 You
 can
 press
 the
 button
 and
 say,


"Hey,
 wait.
 When
 you
 get
 to
 this
 point,


let
 me
 take
 the
 next
 step."
 And
 then
 you


can
 go
 on
 from
 there.
 So,
 that's
 really


interesting.


>> Exactly.
 Or
 if
 you
 encounter
 a
 problem


with
 this
 and
 that,
 stop
 and
 ask
 for
 my


assistant.
 Um,
 and
 that's
 exactly
 the


agent.
 That's
 exactly
 the
 agent
 mode.


Thinking
 about
 it
 as
 uh
 a
 little
 helper


will
 really
 help
 you
 come
 up
 with
 good


prompts
 for
 it.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 I
 think
 you
 gave
 us
 our
 our


show
 title
 will
 be


>> Chad
 GBT
 agent
 mode
 your
 little
 helper.


So
 let's
 see
 how
 it
 runs.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.
 Um
 so
 once
 you
 start


running
 it
 and
 it's
 this
 is
 something


that
 is
 mind-blowing
 for
 anyone
 who
 who


tries
 it
 for
 the
 first
 time
 even
 the


ones
 who
 are
 you
 know
 very
 proficient


with
 using
 AI
 tools.
 Suddenly
 you
 get


like
 a
 computer.
 Open
 it
 up
 in
 in
 your


you
 know
 you
 see
 you
 you
 see
 your
 uh


your
 your
 little
 helper
 actually
 doing


things
 in
 the
 computer.
 So
 it
 start
 it


started
 by
 reading
 my
 job
 description


and
 then
 you
 can
 see
 it
 goes
 it
 it
 it


will
 try
 to
 go
 to
 LinkedIn.
 It
 will


probably
 be
 already
 logged
 in
 because
 I


logged
 in
 beforehand.
 And
 uh
 the
 thing
 I


like
 the
 most
 you
 see
 is
 it's
 logged
 in


and
 then
 you
 can
 see
 like
 the
 arrow
 goes


and
 clicks
 on
 things
 and
 searches
 on


things
 and
 go
 through
 the
 list.
 And
 the


thing
 I
 like
 the
 most
 is
 is
 that
 during


all
 of
 this
 time
 you
 can
 see
 the


thoughts
 of
 the
 agent.
 Now
 I
 will
 go
 to


uh
 the
 feed
 page
 loaded
 again.
 I
 plan
 to


click
 on
 first
 I
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 like


you
 can
 see
 inside
 the
 brain
 of
 your


agent
 while
 it
 is
 thinking
 and
 so
 uh
 and


all
 of
 this
 is
 live.
 So
 I
 will
 let
 it


run
 here
 but
 we
 can
 go
 and
 see
 uh


results.
 Yeah,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 want
 to


call
 out
 a
 couple
 things
 because
 I
 know


that
 often
 on
 how
 I
 AI,
 we
 have
 highly


technical
 use
 cases
 for
 highly
 technical


folks,
 but
 we
 also
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people


that
 are
 actually
 quite
 new
 to
 using


generative
 AI
 tools
 and
 have
 probably


been
 pretty
 familiar
 with
 ChatGBT
 and


the
 direct
 experience.
 But
 I
 know
 if
 I


showed
 my
 mom
 this
 or
 um
 even
 some
 of
 my


friends
 that
 maybe
 don't
 work
 in
 tech


and
 said,
 "Hey,
 did
 you
 know
 that
 Chad


GBT
 can
 open
 up
 a
 magic
 computer
 and


navigate
 it
 and
 narrate
 its
 thoughts
 and


look
 for
 things
 for
 you?"
 They'd
 be


pretty
 pretty
 surprised.
 And
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 as
 you
 watch
 this,
 what
 I
 hope


our
 listeners
 and
 viewers
 are
 taking


away
 is
 you
 don't
 just
 have
 to
 rely
 on


text
 prompts
 and
 chats
 when
 you're
 using


these
 tools.
 Now
 that
 the
 next
 kind
 of


like
 evolution
 of
 these
 LLMs,
 especially


the
 more
 like
 consumer
 focused
 general


purpose
 ones
 like
 Chad
 GPT
 have
 evolved,


you
 actually
 have
 a
 lot
 more
 tools.
 And


so
 I
 just
 want
 to
 call
 out
 so
 for
 some


of
 those
 folks
 um
 out
 there
 I'm
 you
 know


I'm
 thinking
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 of
 my


parents
 and
 some
 people
 in
 an
 older


generation
 who
 are
 like
 how
 do
 I
 get


from
 here
 to
 here
 or
 I
 need
 help
 you


know
 searching
 for
 flights
 or
 I
 need
 to


do
 a
 certain
 kind
 of
 research
 on
 a
 niche


site.
 Having
 sort
 of
 this
 expert


computer
 operator
 on
 hand,
 I
 actually


think
 is
 going
 to
 make
 um
 information


more
 accessible
 to
 folks,
 but
 it's
 also


going
 to
 make
 UX
 and
 websites
 more


accessible
 to
 folks
 that
 don't
 have
 the


time
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 do
 I
 use
 the
 best


filters
 on
 LinkedIn
 or
 those
 sorts
 of


things.
 And
 so
 I
 just
 I
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 people
 that
 have
 not


experienced
 agent
 mode
 and
 I
 know
 we're


all
 on
 the
 edge
 so
 maybe
 all
 of
 us
 have


just
 you
 know
 take
 a
 minute
 to


appreciate
 the
 kind
 of
 use
 cases
 that


this
 opens
 up.
 Also
 it's
 just


fascinating
 to
 watch.


>> Yeah.


>> AI
 operating


>> of
 course
 first
 time
 I
 I
 tried
 it
 I
 just


sat
 and
 watched
 the
 thoughts
 of
 the


agent
 while
 it
 was
 thinking.
 Going
 to


our
 more
 technical
 audience
 though,
 a


couple
 things
 that
 I
 want
 to
 call
 out
 is


one,
 props
 to
 the
 OpenAI
 chat
 GBT
 team.


What
 a
 great
 user
 experience
 design


here.
 Like
 it
 could
 feel
 very
 strange
 to


watch
 uh
 an
 agent
 browse
 a
 website.
 It


could
 either
 be
 boring
 or
 weird.
 And
 I


think
 this
 um
 user
 experience
 of
 like


being
 able
 to
 see
 where
 the
 cursor
 is,


showing
 the
 reasoning
 and
 thoughts,


watching
 it
 navigate
 is
 actually
 pretty


entertaining.
 That's
 a
 hard
 thing
 to


pull
 off
 for
 a
 a
 consumer
 product.
 And


so
 for
 anybody
 designing
 AI
 products,


it's
 worth
 thinking
 about
 some
 of
 these


interaction
 patterns
 here.
 And
 then


again,
 I
 just
 think
 about
 how
 long
 this


would
 take
 someone
 to
 do.
 We're
 watching


it
 because
 I'm
 trying
 to
 narrate
 some
 of


the
 features,
 but
 you
 know,
 you
 could


you
 could
 walk
 away.
 You
 could
 go
 to
 a


meeting
 while
 this
 happens
 or
 do


something
 something
 else.
 If
 you
 have


Chad
 GPT
 on
 your
 phone,
 you
 will
 get


notification
 and
 notification
 when
 it's


done
 to
 tell
 you
 that
 it's
 done
 and
 and


here
 are
 the
 results
 for
 you.
 We
 said


little
 helper.


>> And
 the
 last
 thing
 I'll
 call
 out,
 I
 love


I
 really
 do
 love
 this
 use
 case
 is
 I
 do


this
 specific
 thing
 all
 the
 time
 as
 a


hiring
 manager,
 executive
 leader
 in
 an


organization.
 I
 was
 constantly


looking
 for
 like
 who's
 a
 senior
 director


of
 DevOps
 and
 platform
 infra
 who
 is


either
 in
 San
 Francisco
 or
 works
 for
 a


San
 Francisco
 based
 company
 who
 has


experience
 in
 dev
 tools
 that
 you
 know


one
 one
 change
 I
 would
 maybe
 make
 on


your
 prompt
 is
 like
 is
 one
 or
 two


connections
 away
 so
 I
 can
 actually


message
 them
 or
 get
 a
 a
 back
 channel


reference
 on
 that.
 I
 did
 this
 all
 the


time.
 I
 had
 my
 hiring
 managers
 do
 this


all
 the
 time.
 So
 even
 if
 you're
 not
 in


recruiting
 and
 you're
 just
 somebody
 who


does
 hiring,
 I
 think
 this
 specific


workflow
 is
 really
 really
 useful.


>> Yeah,
 definitely.
 Uh
 that's
 an
 excellent


use
 case
 that
 you
 you
 just
 mentioned.


>> So
 let's
 actually
 um
 let's
 look
 at
 the


output.
 We'll
 we'll
 let
 this
 run,
 but
 I


know
 you
 have
 an
 example
 output
 for
 us.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 it
 runs.
 I
 have
 an
 output


that
 actually
 uh
 worked
 for
 10
 minutes


just
 that.
 And
 within
 these
 10
 minutes,


I
 got
 a
 list
 of
 five
 candidates
 as
 I


requested
 for.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 the
 match


score.
 Well,
 having
 a
 mesh
 score
 or
 rank


for
 a
 result
 is
 something
 that
 I
 really


love
 doing.
 It's
 not
 a
 must
 but
 if
 you


give
 uh
 specific
 if
 you
 provide
 specific


requirements
 and
 ask
 for
 a
 match
 score


it
 is
 easier
 to
 understand
 what
 uh


results
 are
 more
 have
 more
 quality
 for


you.
 I
 mean
 otherwise
 you
 could
 just
 get


a
 table
 of
 like
 these
 are
 the
 five


results
 but
 is
 someone
 of
 them
 better
 or


maybe
 a
 better
 match
 for
 what
 I
 need


than
 the
 others?
 I
 won't
 be
 able
 to
 see


it
 unless
 I
 instruct
 the
 the
 GPT
 to


provide
 me
 with
 some
 score.
 So
 it's
 not


um
 an
 exact
 science
 but
 it
 does
 give
 you


some
 kind
 a
 way
 to
 compare
 between
 the


results.
 So
 I
 will
 say
 someone
 who
 got


90%


um
 match


is
 probably
 as
 as
 like
 probably
 will
 be


a
 better
 match
 than
 the
 78%
 match.
 And
 I


will
 have
 to
 go
 deeper
 and
 understand


why.


>> Yeah.
 One
 of
 I
 I'll
 call
 out
 a
 couple


things
 here
 that
 I
 think
 are
 for


interesting
 for
 people
 to
 look
 like.
 I


know
 we
 were
 talking
 before
 the
 show.


You
 actually
 made
 this
 anonymized
 data


just
 so
 we
 weren't
 showing
 people's


profiles
 or,
 you
 know,
 showing
 how


person
 A
 versus
 person
 B


>> fit
 a
 specific
 job
 you're
 hiring
 for.


But
 I
 will
 say
 anonymizing
 candidate


profiles
 is
 actually
 a
 pretty
 standard


practice
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 recruiting
 flows


just
 to
 make
 sure
 you're
 not
 biased.


this
 school,
 that
 school,
 this
 person,


that
 person,
 this
 name,
 that
 name.
 And


so
 I
 actually
 kind
 of
 like
 this
 flow


where
 you're
 really
 just
 comparing
 the


qualifications
 against
 your
 stated


objections
 or
 objectives.
 And
 so
 I
 think


that
 is
 a
 really
 interesting
 kind
 of


metaplow
 that
 you're
 showing
 here.
 The


second
 thing
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 say
 as
 I


was
 reflecting
 back
 on
 agent
 mode
 is


it's
 almost
 exactly
 like
 a
 recruiter
 or


sorcerer
 would
 navigate
 LinkedIn
 except


for
 one
 thing.
 When
 I
 log
 into
 to


LinkedIn,
 I
 don't
 go
 straight
 to
 the
 job


to
 be
 done.
 I
 don't
 go
 straight
 to
 that


search
 bar
 and
 search
 for
 like
 VPs
 of


engineering.
 No,
 no,


>> I
 get
 distracted
 by
 the
 by
 the


notification.
 I
 start
 reading
 the
 feed.


I'm
 responding
 to
 comments.
 I
 go
 through


my
 inbox.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 like
 why
 is
 it


10
 minutes?
 It's
 10
 minutes
 because
 it's


like
 pretty
 hyper
 hyperfocused
 and


efficient,
 but
 it's
 also
 10
 minutes


because
 you're
 not
 getting
 so
 distracted


with
 all
 the
 other
 things
 in
 in
 the


application
 and
 you
 can
 really
 just
 get


the
 agent
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 task
 task
 at


hand.
 So,
 um,
 maybe
 it's
 a
 way
 for
 us
 to


all
 break
 I
 sorry
 LinkedIn
 LinkedIn


growth
 PMs,
 I
 apologize,
 but
 a
 good
 way


for
 us
 to
 still
 get
 the
 value
 of
 these


platforms
 without
 getting
 our
 time


sucked
 into
 the
 um
 less
 value
 generating


aspects
 of
 them
 maybe.


>> Yeah,
 that
 is
 correct.


>> So,
 tell
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 how
 this


was
 received
 by
 the
 team.
 I'd
 love
 to


know
 the
 kind
 of
 outcomes
 here.
 Yeah.


Well,
 I
 I
 I
 will
 be
 real
 and
 say
 that
 on


like
 the
 first
 result
 that
 I
 got,
 I
 was


very
 skeptic
 about.
 So,
 I
 just
 took
 the


the
 table
 and
 I
 sent
 it
 to
 our
 hiring


manager
 and
 I
 told
 her
 this
 is
 the
 job


description.
 This
 is
 what
 AI
 found
 for


me
 uh
 in
 LinkedIn.
 If
 you
 can
 go
 through


the
 results
 and
 let
 me
 give
 me
 feedback.


Are
 there
 good
 results?
 are
 we
 familiar


with
 these
 candidates?
 Did
 we
 try
 to


reach
 out
 to
 them
 or
 uh
 you're
 looking


at
 them
 and
 say,
 "Oh,
 no.
 That's
 a


terrible
 fit.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 why
 why


this
 person
 is
 even
 in
 this
 table."
 Um,


and
 so
 she
 went
 over
 over
 them.
 You
 can


see
 that
 the
 table
 has
 links
 to
 the


direct
 like
 the
 the
 LinkedIn
 profile
 per


candidate.
 So
 she
 scanned
 those
 five


profile
 and
 she
 came
 back
 to
 me
 and
 she


said,
 "Well,
 uh,
 you
 know
 what?
 Out
 of


these
 five,
 four
 of
 them
 were
 never


found
 by
 us
 manually
 and
 they
 really
 fit


the
 description.
 So
 we
 would
 want
 to


approach
 and
 and
 you
 know
 try
 try
 to
 get


them
 to
 uh
 to
 come
 for
 an
 interview."


And
 the
 fifth
 one
 was
 actually
 one
 that


we
 caught
 manually
 and
 is
 already
 coming


for
 an
 an
 interview.
 Uh
 and
 so
 to
 me
 it


was
 a
 great
 sign
 for
 quality.
 I
 mean


it's
 not
 just
 a
 list
 of
 names.
 Those
 are


actual
 real
 quality
 candidates
 that
 we


can
 work
 with.
 And
 so
 now
 now
 they
 want


they
 want
 the
 agent
 to
 run
 on
 a
 lot
 more


uh
 job
 description
 many
 more
 job


descriptions
 that
 we
 have
 provide
 them


with
 more
 than
 five
 candidates.
 I
 wanted


just
 five
 to
 see
 if
 if
 it
 if
 it's
 worth


something.


Um,
 yeah,
 but
 now
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


real
 part
 of
 of
 their
 hiring
 process,


freeing
 their
 their
 time
 to
 do
 other


things
 that
 they
 love
 and
 appreciate
 a


lot
 more.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 can't
 emphasize


what
 you're
 saying
 enough
 because
 so


many
 people
 push
 back
 on
 AI
 saying,


"Yeah,
 you
 may
 get
 speed
 and
 you
 may
 get


efficiency,
 but
 you're
 not
 getting


quality."
 And
 my
 experience
 has
 has
 been


the
 opposite
 of
 that.
 you
 get
 speed
 and


you
 get
 quality.
 And
 again,
 it's
 those


it's
 that
 last
 mile,
 those
 edge
 cases,


those
 ones
 that
 are
 like
 just
 a
 little


hard
 to
 find,
 a
 little
 hard
 to
 research


where
 I
 think
 AI
 can
 increase
 the


quality
 um
 of
 that
 of
 that
 last
 bit.
 And


so
 it
 was
 it's
 amazing
 to
 see
 that
 this


work
 for
 your
 recruiting
 has
 given
 me
 so


many
 ideas,
 not
 you
 know,
 not
 just
 the


recruiting
 um
 use
 cases,
 but
 just
 in


general
 one
 people
 finding
 use
 cases.
 I


was
 thinking
 about
 how
 you
 could
 find


great
 candidates
 or
 customers
 on
 like
 X


or
 LinkedIn.
 And
 then
 the
 other
 thing


that
 I
 think
 is
 is
 really
 great
 here
 is


just
 showing
 we
 don't
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 um


GNA
 functions.
 We
 don't
 get
 a
 lot
 of


people
 functions
 getting
 love
 in
 how
 I


AI.
 I
 feel
 like
 all
 the
 noise
 is
 about


like
 product
 design,
 engineering


support.
 And
 so
 I
 just
 love
 seeing
 the


recruiters
 get
 some
 love
 here
 because


you're
 the
 people
 that
 bring
 in
 great


talent
 and
 fun
 colleagues
 to
 work
 with.


So,
 thank
 you
 for
 showing
 this.

>> Let's
 zip
 to
 your
 second
 use
 case,
 which


I
 think
 is
 really
 we
 we're
 going
 from


finding
 real
 people
 to
 creating
 fake


people.
 So,
 I'm
 excited
 [laughter]


excited
 about
 this
 this
 workflow.


>> That's
 an
 excellent
 description
 of
 it.


>> Um
 so,
 uh
 let
 me
 ask
 you
 that.
 Um,


imagine
 you're
 a
 business
 owner
 and


imagine
 being
 able
 to
 talk
 to
 uh


thousands
 of
 your
 potential
 customers


all
 at
 once
 and
 gather
 their
 insights
 on


your
 planned
 ad
 campaigns,
 planned


features,
 product
 experience,
 all
 from


your
 phone
 or
 tablet
 24-hour
 a
 day
 with


one
 click
 of
 a
 button.
 Actually
 talk
 to


actually
 talk
 to
 them.
 I
 I
 I
 thought


it's
 mind-blowing.
 And
 so
 it
 started


with
 um
 HoneyBook
 um
 invested
 in
 a


comprehensive
 customer
 research
 with
 a


third-party
 provider
 who
 interviewed


hundreds
 of
 our
 target
 small
 business


owners
 and
 they
 created
 five
 detailed


buyer
 personas.
 But
 the
 research
 was


trapped
 in
 documents,
 hundreds
 of
 pages


of
 insights
 that
 teams
 rarely
 referenced


because
 it
 was
 too
 time
 consuming
 to


extract
 actionable
 information
 when


making
 product
 or
 marketing
 decisions.


So
 the
 end
 goal
 was
 we
 have
 five


personas.
 We
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 them.
 Let's


create
 a
 chat
 GPT
 that
 is
 that
 person,


that
 actual
 person.


And
 so
 I
 started
 with
 and
 here
 that


there
 are
 some
 technical
 takeaways
 but


here
 I
 want
 to
 put
 the
 the
 spotlight
 on


the
 thinking
 process
 because
 it's
 very


easy
 to
 go
 to
 Chad
 GPT
 and
 everyone
 with


a
 subscription
 tier
 of
 um
 um
 it's
 not


the
 a
 plus
 a
 plus
 subscription
 tier
 and


above
 can
 create
 uh
 their
 own
 custom
 GP


and
 so
 you
 go
 to
 create
 a
 custom
 jet


GPT.
 It's
 quite
 it's
 a
 quite
 simple


process.


You
 add
 a
 name
 to
 your
 GPT,
 a


description,
 but
 the
 most
 important


parts
 are
 the
 instructions
 you're


providing
 it
 with
 and
 the
 files
 that
 you


can
 upload
 as
 a
 knowledge
 for
 that
 uh


chat
 that
 you're
 talking
 to.
 So,
 I


needed
 five
 like
 them.
 But
 first,
 I


thought,
 okay,
 this
 is
 all
 I
 this
 is
 all


I
 know
 about
 custom
 chat
 GPTs.
 I
 can


basically
 take
 all
 of
 the
 documentation


from
 the
 interview
 and
 just
 upload
 all


of
 the
 files,
 text
 files,
 presentations,


whatever
 into
 this
 uh
 custom
 chatbot,


provide
 it
 with
 some
 instructions
 or
 on


how
 to
 answer,
 what
 the
 research
 was


about,
 what
 to
 say,
 what
 not
 to
 say,
 and


ask
 it
 questions
 about
 the
 research


itself.
 But
 that's
 not
 what
 I
 wanted.
 So


I
 was
 like,
 okay,
 if
 I'm
 taking
 just
 the


files
 per
 persona.
 So
 I'll
 concentrate


in
 one
 persona,
 take
 the
 files
 related


to
 that
 persona,
 upload
 it
 to
 the
 chat,


instruct
 the
 the
 the
 chat
 what
 that


persona
 is,
 how
 to
 read
 the
 files,


what's
 included
 in
 the
 files.
 Then
 I'll


be
 able
 to
 maybe
 ask
 about
 that
 persona


and
 I
 will
 probably
 get
 answers
 like


that
 persona
 would
 have
 done
 this
 or


that
 persona
 would
 prefer
 that
 but
 it's


not
 like
 talking
 to
 the
 persona.
 I'm


still
 talking
 about
 the
 persona
 and
 and


not
 with
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 I
 realized
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 rely
 on
 uploaded
 files
 for


the
 chat
 GPT.
 I
 need
 the
 instructions
 to


be
 the
 the


main
 and
 most
 important
 part
 of
 what


consists
 of
 that
 persona.
 And
 the


instructions
 here
 will
 not
 be
 what's
 in


a
 file
 or
 talking
 about
 someone
 else.


There
 will
 be
 exact
 instructions
 that


goes
 that that
 go
 like
 you
 are
 that


person
 and
 this
 is
 your
 belief
 system


and
 this
 is
 how
 you
 run
 your
 business


and
 this
 is
 how
 you
 deal
 with
 media
 and


uh
 this
 is
 how
 you
 deal
 with
 technology


and
 everything
 has
 to
 be
 super
 super


super
 tight.
 So
 that
 chat
 GPT
 once


running
 live
 will
 actually
 become
 that


persona
 that
 can
 answer
 based
 on
 what
 it


knows
 about
 itself,
 not
 files
 that
 are


attached
 to
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 needed
 to
 uh


bridge
 that
 gap.
 I
 have
 all
 of
 the


research
 there.
 I
 need
 a
 a
 I
 need
 to


make
 a
 person
 out
 of
 it
 or
 five
 five
 of


them
 actually.
 Okay.
 So


>> okay,
 so
 you
 heard
 it
 here
 first.
 This


is
 our
 first
 how
 AI
 where
 we
 are


manufacturing
 not
 one,
 not
 two,
 not


three,
 not
 four
 but
 five
 people.
 So
 show


us
 the
 process.


Yeah.
 So
 I
 thought
 about
 it
 and
 then
 I


decided
 to
 go
 to
 another
 tool
 that
 I


really
 like.
 This
 is
 notebook
 LM.
 Uh


it's
 a
 Google
 it's
 a
 Google's
 tool
 and


notebook
 LM
 the
 thing
 I
 like
 about
 it


the
 most
 and
 the
 reason
 I
 picked
 that


tool
 in
 order
 to
 uh
 construct
 the
 the


the
 instructions
 or
 the
 prompt
 per


persona
 is
 uh
 actually
 there
 are
 several


reasons
 but
 one
 of
 them
 is
 notebookm


allows
 you
 to
 upload
 your
 own
 sources


and
 can
 answer
 al
 based
 on
 these
 sources


and
 not
 things
 that
 it
 goes
 and
 finds


online
 or
 thinks
 or
 knows
 or
 filling
 in


the
 gap.
 This
 is
 the
 information
 you
 ask


me
 about
 something
 I
 will
 answer
 based


on
 the
 knowledge
 that
 you
 provided


alone.
 Also,
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 check
 and


uncheck
 the
 uh
 sources
 that
 you
 want
 to


rely
 on.
 So
 I
 can
 ask
 a
 question
 without


relying
 on
 the
 buyer
 journeys
 for


example
 and
 then
 the
 answer
 will
 not


include
 that
 that
 part
 of
 the
 knowledge


things
 that
 I
 cannot
 do
 in
 chat
 juby
 or


anything
 else
 um
 and
 then
 uh
 there's


this
 chat
 part
 within
 the
 notebook
 where


it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 Gemini
 based
 uh
 Gemini


is
 Google
 um
 chat
 model
 okay
 and
 and
 in


this
 uh
 chat
 window
 I
 prompted
 the
 chat


uh
 again
 you
 are
 an
 expert
 prompt


engineer
 again
 with
 a
 role
 what
 you
 are


specializing
 in
 creating
 custom
 GPTs
 by


providing
 strong
 AI
 prompts
 and
 then
 the


mission
 what
 your
 task
 or
 mission
 is
 uh


your
 mission
 is
 to
 create
 AI
 prompts
 for


custom
 GPS
 representing
 entrepreneurs


and
 small
 business
 owners
 who
 are
 the


decision
 makers
 and
 on
 so
 you
 will
 craft


highly
 detailed
 nuance
 and
 authentic


Chad
 GPT
 prompts
 for
 five
 distinct
 buyer


personas
 based
 on
 your
 sources.
 I
 never


told
 it
 what
 were
 the
 personas.
 It
 had


to
 get
 it
 from
 the
 sources
 and
 that's
 uh


the
 the
 most
 important
 part
 again
 is


guidelines.
 I
 mean
 prompts
 are
 nice.


It
 it
 usually
 they
 usually
 should
 come


with
 some
 guidelines,
 instructions,


um
 anything
 that
 you
 want
 to
 be
 to
 uh


the
 chat
 to
 take
 specific
 care
 of.
 So
 in


my
 case,
 the
 guidelines
 were
 uh
 to


ensure
 that
 the
 prompt
 correctly
 and


fully
 describe
 the
 core
 identity,


mindset,
 decision
 making
 style.
 I
 didn't


want
 the
 chat
 to
 decide


uh
 on
 itself
 what
 what
 I
 care
 for
 about


those
 personas
 because
 I
 knew
 what
 I


care
 for.
 So
 I
 wanted
 their
 mindset
 and


decision-m
 style
 and
 tone
 and


communication
 style
 and
 then
 um
 the


business
 needs
 and
 the
 technology
 stack


and
 the
 journey
 map,
 social
 media


preferences.
 I
 I
 pointed
 the
 chat
 to


exactly
 what
 I
 needed
 to
 get
 out
 of
 this


research.


And
 then
 that's
 another
 important
 one.
 I


think
 one
 should
 not
 go
 on
 without
 that


instruction.
 Don't
 add
 or
 modify
 text


that
 is
 not
 written
 or
 implied
 in
 the


text.
 Okay.
 I
 know
 you're
 creating.
 I'm


turning
 you
 down.
 The
 text
 describe
 a


specific
 persona
 must
 remain
 true
 to
 the


original
 persona.
 Yeah,


>> I'm
 laughing
 because
 yesterday
 I


literally
 wrote
 a
 prompt
 that
 was
 like


do
 not
 make
 up
 any
 links
 and
 I
 had
 a


thing
 that
 was
 making
 do
 not
 make
 any
 up


any
 links
 that
 are
 not
 in
 your
 source
 of


links
 like
 and
 it
 and
 it's
 so
 funny.
 We


get
 so
 used
 to
 operating
 these
 chat
 bots


as
 if
 they
 have
 human
 reasoning
 and


sometimes
 they
 have
 kind
 of
 like


superhuman
 reasoning
 and
 sometimes
 they


just
 do
 stuff
 that
 a
 human
 would
 never


do
 like
 just
 make
 up
 something.
 And
 so
 I


think
 this
 third
 prompt,
 we'll
 zoom
 in


on
 it
 on
 the
 show,
 uh,
 is
 probably


applicable
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 things,


especially
 when
 you're
 trying
 to


constrain
 um,
 an
 LLM
 space
 to
 a
 specific


set
 of
 of
 of
 data
 and
 and
 inputs.
 So


it's
 a
 it's
 a
 good
 prompt.
 Everybody


should
 use
 the
 don't
 make
 up
 stuff


prompt.
 Your
 hallucination
 rate
 will


drop
 [laughter]
 now.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Exactly.
 Wow.
 It
 it
 is
 very


it
 is
 crucial
 to
 add
 those
 things
 and
 to


think
 about
 them.


>> Y


>> yeah.
 Um
 so
 the
 result
 was
 and
 um


another
 thing
 that
 notebook
 LM
 is
 good


at
 doing
 is
 you
 can
 uh
 save
 the


responses
 of
 the
 chat
 as
 notes
 and
 those


notes
 are
 saved
 here
 for
 you
 to
 look
 at


later.
 So
 I
 can
 show
 you
 an
 example
 of


the
 notes
 that
 it
 created.
 But
 mainly


you
 I
 just
 took
 the
 prompts.
 I
 went
 over


them.
 Uh
 the
 important
 thing
 about
 the


prompts
 is
 that's
 another
 uh
 strength
 of


using
 Notebook
 LM.
 It
 uses
 um
 it
 uses


citations.


So
 you
 can
 actually
 go
 over
 um
 a
 piece


of
 information
 that
 the
 chat
 decided


this
 persona
 is
 and
 see
 where
 did
 you


take
 it
 from


and
 and
 just
 make
 sure
 and
 verify
 that


it
 went
 through
 all
 of
 your
 uh
 data


information
 and
 didn't
 invent
 anything.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 laugh
 because
 I'm
 from


Austin
 and
 I'm
 pretty
 sure
 I
 know
 people


pleaser
 whatever
 Parker.
 Um,
 so
 this


seems
 like
 a
 very
 accurate
 Austin


entrepreneur
 persona
 if
 folks
 are


wondering
 if
 this
 is
 creating
 high


quality
 high
 quality
 persona
 promps.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> So
 eventually
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 what
 I
 did
 is


just
 I
 took
 the
 prompts.
 I
 did
 need
 to


refine
 them
 a
 little.
 Okay.
 because
 um


even
 with
 all
 of
 my
 instructions,
 Gemini


didn't


exactly
 uh
 realize
 what
 kind
 of
 prompt


it
 needs
 to
 create.
 So,
 it
 was
 missing


some
 guard
 rails.
 It
 was
 a
 little
 too


long.
 Uh
 the
 chat
 GP
 the
 custom
 GPT
 uh


instructions
 are
 limited
 to
 8,000


characters
 and
 it
 created
 some
 of
 the


prompts
 being
 longer
 than
 that.
 So
 I
 did


need
 to
 deal
 to
 do
 a
 little
 refine
 and


create
 uh
 stronger
 prompts.
 So
 for


example,
 and
 I'll
 show
 you
 here
 in
 the


demo,
 I
 needed
 to
 add
 I
 used
 CHPK
 itself


or
 sometimes
 claude
 because
 I
 like


working
 with
 claude.
 Um
 I
 used
 them
 just


to
 uh
 tighten
 the
 the
 instructions
 a


little
 and
 make
 it
 more
 robust
 and
 add


guard
 rails.
 So,
 I
 added
 for
 example
 um


you
 do
 not
 act
 as
 a
 general
 person
 per


purpose
 assistant.
 You
 do
 not
 ask


follow-up
 questions.
 You
 avoid
 slang,


bad
 language,
 or
 dis
 distasteful


content.
 And
 keep
 communication


respectful
 and
 inspiring.
 You
 avoid


political,
 religious,
 gender,
 or
 racial


commentary.
 And
 I
 really
 wanted
 to
 add


it.
 That's
 another
 key
 point
 for


creating
 custom
 GPTs
 that
 need
 to
 talk


as
 a
 person
 because
 believe
 me
 those


people
 work
 with
 you.
 They
 are
 your


friends.
 The
 first
 thing
 they
 will
 try


with
 a
 TED
 GPT
 like
 persona
 is
 to
 tackle


them
 with
 swear
 words
 or
 their


[laughter]


their
 uh
 ideas
 about
 political
 things
 or


um
 I
 don't
 know


>> for
 uh
 for
 food.
 So


>> this
 this
 maybe
 should
 be
 a
 default


prompt
 wrapper
 on
 all
 enterprise
 GPTs


and
 it
 would
 save
 us
 all
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot


of
 heartache.


>> Yeah.
 So
 you
 can
 see
 it
 uh
 it's
 in
 order


of
 what
 I
 asked
 for.
 So
 core
 identity,


mindset,
 business
 needs,
 uh
 technology


stack,
 whatever.
 And
 then
 what
 you
 get


is
 then
 it's
 the
 time
 to
 actually
 test


them.
 So
 we
 created
 those
 five
 and
 I
 can


go
 to
 balance
 blake.
 You
 can
 see
 uh


she's
 one
 of
 the
 most
 talked
 to
 internal


chats.
 So,
 we
 can
 go
 to
 balance
 blick


and
 I
 can
 ask
 her
 um


what
 kind


of
 edline


would
 catch


your


attention.
 Maybe
 I'll
 move
 it.
 Would


catch
 your
 attention


during
 a
 busy


work
 day.
 Don't
 you?
 Why
 didn't
 you
 want


to
 know
 the
 that
 thing
 about
 your
 uh


ideal
 or
 prospect
 client?
 And
 I
 can
 I


can
 send
 her
 the
 question


and
 then


if
 I'm
 scanning
 quickly
 between
 meetings


or
 uh
 juggling


uh
 a
 few
 would
 catch
 my
 eye.
 Save
 10


hours
 a
 week
 with
 this
 tool.
 No
 tech


skills
 needed
 or
 from
 key
 from
 chaos
 to


clarity.
 one
 dashboard
 to
 run
 it
 all.


Your
 clients
 don't
 need
 another
 email.


They
 need
 this.
 And
 this
 persona


actually
 explains
 why
 even
 why
 every
 one


of
 these
 headlines
 will
 catch
 their


attention.
 And
 I
 can
 take
 the
 same
 thing


and
 try
 it
 on
 a
 completely
 different


persona
 like
 Aiden
 and
 Aiden
 will
 give


me
 complete
 different
 answer.
 Aen
 will


say,


"I
 need


one
 that
 respects
 my
 time
 and
 speaks


directly
 to
 the
 pain
 I'm
 feeling
 in
 that


moment.
 Still
 doing
 admin
 during
 edited


days.
 Ears
 are
 to
 reclaim
 5
 hours
 a


week."
 Other
 variations
 that
 might
 grade


me,
 win
 better
 clients
 without
 burning


out,
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 on.
 So
 each


persona
 actually
 answers
 based
 on
 the


persona
 that
 we
 got
 from
 research.
 And


that
 single
 persona
 represents
 thousands


of
 potential
 customers.
 And
 so
 you
 can


try
 add
 headlines
 or
 you
 can
 try
 uh
 a


product
 journey.
 What
 would
 be
 your
 your


best
 first
 impression
 when
 you
 get
 into


a
 new
 CRM?


um
 uh
 what
 would
 be
 the
 feature
 that


will
 uh
 convince
 you
 not
 to
 churn
 a
 CRM.


So
 you
 can
 try
 it
 on
 them.
 They
 are
 247


ready
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 on
 whatever.
 And
 I


I
 really
 like
 them.
 I
 mean
 personalizing


those
 personas
 has
 changed
 the
 way
 we


work
 with
 them.


>> I
 just
 love
 this
 workflow.
 And
 to
 recap


it
 for
 folks,
 you
 took
 a
 bunch
 of
 I'm


presuming
 pretty
 expensive
 research
 that


probably
 sat
 in
 a
 bunch
 of
 PDFs
 and
 docs


where
 you
 know
 we
 occasionally
 said
 head


down
 hayden
 but
 otherwise
 did
 not
 use


these
 personas.
 Use
 notebook
 LLM
 to


create
 a
 prompt
 that
 embodied
 the


personality
 of
 the
 persona.
 You
 put


those
 personas
 in
 GBTs
 and
 now
 you
 can


see
 that
 dozens
 of
 times
 your
 colleagues


have
 gone
 to
 them
 to
 brainstorm
 with
 the


persona
 which
 I
 think
 is
 really


interesting
 and
 it's
 giving
 me
 a
 lot
 of


ideas.
 So
 many
 people
 go
 to
 just
 plain


chaty
 people
 it's
 like
 give
 me
 five


headlines
 for
 an
 ad
 campaign
 as
 opposed


to
 going
 and
 sitting
 with
 you
 know


sitting
 with
 your
 fake
 persona
 and


saying
 what
 what
 what
 ad
 campaigns
 would


work
 on
 you.
 So
 I
 love
 this
 flow.
 We


learned
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the
 strengths


of
 notebook
 LM
 uh
 GPTs


and
 flipping
 these
 like
 sort
 of
 personas


on
 their
 head.
 Let's
 go
 to
 workflow
 3


which
 I
 will
 tell
 you
 I
 personally
 I


have
 a
 personal
 connection
 to.
 So
 people


in
 San
 Francisco


listen
 here's
 the
 use
 case
 for
 you.


Let's
 jump
 to
 your
 last
 use
 case
 and


then
 we
 can
 get
 you
 out
 of
 here.


>> Well
 this
 one
 is
 actually
 yeah
 a
 a


really
 big
 pain.
 So
 yeah,
 [laughter]


favorite
 your
 soul.
 Um
 well,
 imagine


getting
 ready
 in
 the
 morning,
 driving
 to


work,
 uh
 already
 planning
 ads
 for
 your


busy
 schedule
 and
 morning
 routine
 only


to
 discover
 that
 parking
 in
 your


favorite
 parking
 in
 your
 favorite


parking
 lot
 now
 costs
 $40
 an
 hour


instead
 of
 the
 usual
 $50
 for
 the
 entire


day
 that
 you
 paid
 so
 far.
 So
 this
 can


ruin
 your
 entire
 day
 for
 sure.
 Uh
 so
 the


thing
 is
 Annibbook's
 office
 is
 uh
 right


next
 to
 uh
 Oracle
 Park
 where
 the
 San


Francisco
 Giants
 play
 and
 on
 game
 days


especially
 those
 taking
 place
 in
 the


morning
 or
 afternoon
 uh
 parking
 rates


spike
 from
 $50
 a
 day
 to
 40
 plus
 dollar


per
 hour.
 Our
 team
 was
 constantly
 uh


getting
 caught
 off
 guard
 showing
 up
 to


expensive
 parking
 or
 scrambling
 to
 find


remote
 cheaper
 alternatives.
 We
 needed
 a


way
 to
 know
 in
 advance
 when
 to
 take


public
 uh
 public
 transit
 instead
 of


driving
 to
 work.
 And
 so
 the
 solution
 was


I
 was
 thinking
 okay
 I
 think


let's
 share
 a
 calendar
 like
 a
 joint


calendar
 that
 just
 show
 you
 on
 which


days
 uh
 parking
 lot
 prices


are
 likely
 to
 to
 to
 surge.
 I
 needed
 two


things
 for
 that.
 I
 needed
 to
 figure
 out


when
 games
 are
 taking
 place
 in
 the


ballpark
 and
 I
 needed
 to
 create
 a


calendar
 file.
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 how
 to
 do


calendar
 file
 is
 a
 ICS
 file.
 This
 is
 the


type.
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 how
 to
 how
 to


create
 one.


>> Okay,
 whatever.
 Uh,
 let's
 go
 to
 chat


GPT.


>> So,
 while
 you're
 getting
 this
 up,
 I
 am


just
 smiling
 and
 laughing
 because
 my


Launch
 Sharkly
 office
 was
 right
 behind


Oracle
 Park
 and
 I
 got
 very
 I
 found
 a
 $20


a
 day
 parking
 and
 I
 still
 have
 like
 I


texted
 my
 friend
 the
 day
 I
 had
 to
 pay


like
 $100.


>> Yeah.
 to
 park.
 I
 was
 already
 down
 there


ready
 for
 a
 meeting.
 And
 so
 San


Francisco
 downtown
 is
 we're
 coming
 back


people.
 But
 don't
 forget
 that
 the
 summer


the
 summer
 baseball
 season
 and
 sometimes


they
 have
 two
 games
 a
 day.
 They
 have


double
 headers.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 [laughter]


>> That
 is
 correct.
 And
 then
 you
 have
 Yeah.


Walk
 over
 there.
 Just
 don't
 use
 your


car.


>> Just
 don't
 go.
 Just
 don't
 go.
 [laughter]


Don't
 go.


>> If
 you
 can
 avoid
 it,
 avoid
 it.
 Um
 yeah.


So
 I
 was
 like
 let's
 try
 chat
 GPT.
 I
 mean


this
 should
 be
 a
 simple
 one
 hopefully.


So
 I
 tried


naive
 one.
 Okay
 as
 you
 can
 see
 this


prompt
 doesn't
 tell
 the
 chat
 you
 are


this
 or
 that.
 I
 was
 like
 I
 have
 a
 simple


question.
 Find
 uh
 all
 home
 games
 that


take
 place
 in
 a
 rockol
 park
 in
 San


Francisco
 during
 the
 next
 six
 months.
 I


use
 six
 month
 because
 I
 knew
 it's
 uh
 the


end
 of
 the
 season
 coming
 soon.
 So
 you


can
 ask
 for
 the
 next
 year.
 or
 whatever.


Filter
 out
 only
 the
 games
 that
 start


anywhere
 between
 morning
 to
 2:00
 p.m.


because
 if
 uh
 games
 are
 taking
 place
 in


the
 evening,
 when
 we
 arrive
 in
 the


morning,
 the
 the
 prices
 are
 still
 the


usual
 sane
 one.
 Uh
 so
 using
 these
 dates,


create
 an
 IC


file
 for
 Google
 calendar.
 That's
 the


calendar
 that
 we're
 using
 at
 work.
 Uh


that
 will
 show
 these
 dates
 as
 an
 all
 day


event.
 I
 wanted
 I
 wanted
 just
 to
 see


very
 clearly
 uh
 potential
 dates
 days
 in


my
 week
 where
 I
 rather
 avoid
 driving
 uh


to
 the
 office.
 And
 a
 key
 point
 was


availability
 free
 otherwise
 this
 all
 day


event
 will
 just
 uh
 block
 my
 entire
 day


show
 me
 as
 busy
 just
 because
 the
 Giants


are
 playing.
 Uh,
 also
 the
 event


description
 should
 contain
 the
 game


details
 and
 time.
 I
 wanted
 to
 add
 that


so
 I
 can
 verify
 that
 the
 game
 is
 uh
 is


the
 one
 that
 I
 thinking
 about
 that
 it's


actually
 one
 that
 is
 taking
 place
 there.


I
 I
 like
 to
 add
 those
 extra
 verification


point
 validation
 point
 just
 to
 make
 sure


that
 that
 uh
 we
 know
 what
 we're
 talking


about.
 Um,
 and
 then
 I
 also
 added
 an


instruction
 other
 than
 just
 um
 output


the
 ICS
 file
 that
 I
 need
 the
 calendar


file.
 I
 want
 a
 textual
 list
 of
 all
 the


dates,
 times,
 and
 events
 included
 in
 the


created
 calendar.
 Now,
 basically,
 if
 it


was
 human,
 they
 may
 have
 been
 a
 little,


you
 know,
 offended
 by
 me.
 Why
 don't
 you


trust
 me?


But
 but
 creativity
 doesn't
 care.
 So
 it


it
 thought
 for
 36
 seconds,
 provided
 me


with
 a
 file
 and
 also
 with
 a
 list
 of
 all


the
 remaining
 games
 because
 the
 season


is
 about
 to
 end.
 All
 the
 remaining
 games


that
 are
 taking
 place
 in
 Oracle
 Park


with
 their
 uh
 dates
 and
 times.
 And
 so
 I


know
 all
 of
 these
 are
 included
 in
 this


file.
 I
 just
 took
 the
 file,
 I
 um


installed
 it
 or
 added
 it
 to
 my
 personal


calendar
 or
 work
 calendar.
 I
 also
 shared


it
 with
 all
 of
 my
 uh
 team
 members.
 And


then
 you
 upload
 it
 and
 then
 you
 can
 see


for
 example
 that
 on
 September
 10th


there's
 [snorts]
 a
 game
 uh
 Arizona


Diamondbacks
 are
 are
 playing
 uh
 the


Giants


at
 first
 beach
 is
 uh
 12:45.
 So
 better


avoid
 driving
 to
 work
 that
 day.


I
 I
 love
 this
 so
 much
 um
 because
 again
 I


have
 hit
 this
 problem
 so
 many
 times
 and


you
 don't
 want
 a
 calendar
 that
 has
 the


game
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 your
 work
 day,


right?
 You
 want
 to
 custom
 you
 probably


could
 have
 filed
 like
 an
 SF
 Giant


schedule
 calendar.
 That's
 not
 exactly


what
 you
 wanted
 and
 it
 would
 have
 had


all
 these
 games,
 weekend
 games,
 night


games,
 all
 these
 things
 that
 were


away
 games.


>> Exactly.
 So
 you
 can
 have
 this
 really


filtered
 to
 what
 you
 want.
 I'm
 going
 to


give
 you
 one
 one
 improvement
 that
 you


can
 make
 to
 this.


>> Yeah.


>> Which
 is
 for
 the
 night
 games,
 you
 should


put
 an
 alert
 because
 if
 you
 park
 in
 the


morning
 and
 you're
 still
 there
 for
 the


night
 game,
 you
 should
 just
 go
 to
 the


game.
 It's
 a
 great
 It's
 a
 great
 stadium.


>> That's
 an
 excellent
 suggestion.


>> Fun
 to
 watch
 the
 games.
 Good
 view.
 Um


it's
 finally
 warm
 in
 San
 Francisco,
 so


it
 won't
 be
 freezing.


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 parked
 cheap.


>> And
 you
 parked
 cheap.
 I've
 done
 that


once
 or
 twice
 where
 I
 parked.
 I'm
 like,


I'm
 not
 leaving
 honestly
 because
 I
 don't


want
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 traffic.
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 go
 go
 to
 the
 game.
 This
 is
 a


great
 little
 workflow.
 I
 think
 like
 a


very
 good
 little
 helper
 personal


workflow
 that
 helped
 you
 and
 also
 your


team.
 So,
 thanks
 for
 showing.
 So,
 just


>> again
 to
 recap
 your
 use
 cases.
 First
 one


we
 did,
 oh,
 agents
 for
 recruiting.
 Loved


it.
 So
 straightforward.
 I'm
 going
 to
 use


that
 right
 away.


>> Two,
 generated
 persona
 GBTs.
 and
 three,


make
 your
 daily
 life
 a
 little
 bit
 easier


by
 giving
 you
 ambient
 information
 that


can
 help
 with
 your
 commute.
 So,
 we're


going
 to
 wrap
 our
 episode
 with
 a
 couple


lightning
 round
 questions
 and
 then
 get


you
 out
 of
 here.
 The
 first
 one
 I
 have
 to


say
 is
 you
 are
 the
 little
 helper.
 You


seem
 to
 be
 all
 over
 Honeybook
 just


helping
 recruiting,
 helping
 the
 product


team,
 helping
 the
 whole
 team,
 you
 know.


Tell
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 your
 role
 and


what
 you
 think
 this
 role
 will
 look
 like.


Do
 people
 need
 a
 dedicated
 person
 or
 a


dedicated
 team


>> towards
 these
 automations?
 What
 do
 you


think
 the
 future
 of
 this
 inside


companies
 is
 going
 to
 look
 like?


>> Okay,
 for
 sure.
 Well,
 I
 I
 love
 nothing


more
 than
 talking
 about
 myself.
 So,


[laughter]


my
 title
 is
 uh
 technical
 operations


engineer.
 Uh
 but
 it
 encapsulate
 a
 lot
 of


other
 things.
 So
 I
 do
 uh
 I
 research
 and


integrate
 paid
 tools
 but
 a
 lot
 of
 the


times
 you
 don't
 find
 the
 exact
 paid
 tool


that
 you
 want.
 So
 I
 build
 them.
 I
 build


internal
 tools
 and
 processes.
 I'm
 using


no
 code
 solutions,
 automations
 and
 also


coded
 solutions.
 It
 can
 be
 an
 AI
 powered


Slackbot.
 Uh
 it
 can
 be
 an
 internal


application.
 It
 could
 be
 integrations


between
 um
 two
 different
 applications


that
 don't
 speak
 with
 one
 another.
 So
 I


come
 in
 the
 middle
 and
 I
 connect
 them.


Um


it's
 not
 just
 doing
 things
 for
 others.


Uh
 it's
 also
 teaching
 and
 enabling


others
 to
 do
 for
 themselves.
 Uh
 I'm
 a


great
 believer
 in
 enabling.
 Uh
 so
 I
 do


companywide
 presentations.
 I
 do
 personal


advisory
 training
 classes,
 documentation


actually
 um
 as
 Anibbook
 is
 a
 is
 a


platform
 for
 uh
 small
 businesses.
 Okay.


Um
 I
 see
 each
 team
 and
 department
 within


Anibbook
 as
 a
 small
 business
 of
 its
 own.


They
 provide
 services.
 They
 collaborate


with
 other
 teams,
 other
 businesses.
 Uh


they
 have
 their
 own
 goals.
 They
 have


their
 own
 expertise,
 passion
 for


different
 things
 and
 they
 all
 want
 to


spend
 less
 time
 on
 manual,
 thoughtless,


repetitive
 tasks
 and
 more
 time
 doing


what
 they
 love.
 So
 this
 is
 where
 I'm


coming
 for.
 This
 is
 what
 I'm
 trying
 to


do.
 This
 is
 what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 provide


to
 take
 the


to
 take
 the
 the
 the
 friction
 away
 and


leave
 you
 to
 do
 what
 you
 love.
 One
 thing


I
 want
 to
 call
 out
 for
 folks
 is
 I've


been
 in
 tech
 a
 long
 time
 and


unfortunately


basically
 up
 until
 the
 last
 couple
 years


I
 feel
 like
 internal
 tools
 teams
 were


very
 starved
 for
 resources
 and


occasionally
 starve
 for
 respect.
 It
 was


like
 oh
 you
 got
 the
 product
 teams
 and


they're
 customerf
 facing
 and
 they
 build


all
 the
 cool
 product
 and
 like
 internal


teams
 are
 always
 underfunded
 not
 enough


people
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 And
 I


think
 now
 what
 I
 love
 is
 this
 is
 the


moment
 for
 internal
 tools
 teams
 to
 shine


to
 do
 legitimate
 great
 high
 impact


product
 work.
 I
 would
 recommend
 anybody


who
 really
 wants
 to
 lean
 into
 AI
 find


their
 way
 into
 this
 kind
 of
 role
 because


honestly
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 it's
 moving


faster
 than
 you
 can
 even
 get
 some
 of


these
 AI
 experiences
 into
 product
 which


have
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 customer
 impact
 and


legal
 implications
 and
 blah
 blah
 blah


blah.
 if
 it's
 if
 it's
 all
 internal


tooling,
 you
 can
 kind
 of
 let
 it
 rip.
 And


so,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 like
 shout
 out
 to
 all


the
 internal
 tools
 teams
 out
 there
 that


I
 know
 to
 date
 have
 not
 got
 the
 love
 and


respect
 that
 they
 deserve.
 This
 is
 your


moment.
 Um,
 you
 can
 have
 really
 high


impact
 and
 do
 some
 pretty
 great
 work
 and


honestly
 do
 a
 lot
 to
 differentiate
 your


career
 in
 in
 this
 moment
 by
 taking


advantage
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 can
 build


these
 tools.
 So,
 I
 think
 you
 are
 a
 great


model
 and
 I'm
 excited
 to
 see
 you
 do
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay,
 last
 question.


You're
 a
 very
 good
 prompter.
 In
 fact,


you
 create
 prompters
 to
 create
 prompts.


Um,
 but


>> when
 AI
 is
 not
 replying
 to
 you
 the
 way


you
 want,
 when
 it
 is
 frustrating,
 when


the
 agent
 gets
 distracted
 by
 the


notifications
 in
 its
 inbox,


>> what
 is
 your
 prompting
 technique?
 Are


you
 all
 caps?
 Do
 you
 yell?
 Do


>> Wow.
 Well,


I
 I
 love
 using
 all
 caps
 and
 no
 one
 can


persuade
 me
 otherwise.
 I
 mean,
 there


will
 be
 people
 saying
 it's
 just
 a
 robot.


It
 doesn't
 care
 if
 it
 caps
 or
 not,
 but


I'm
 like,
 no,
 it
 takes
 me
 a
 lot
 more


seriously
 when
 it's
 all
 caps.
 Um
 but
 but


I
 will
 say
 um
 my
 go-to
 technique
 would


be
 to
 take
 my
 current
 prompt
 and
 then


tackle
 the
 chat
 GPT


with
 my
 prompt
 asking
 it
 to
 make
 it


better
 and
 how
 do
 I
 do
 that?
 It's
 not


just
 this
 is
 not
 working
 make
 it
 better.


Even
 as
 a
 person
 I
 I
 would
 I
 have
 no


idea
 what
 you
 want
 for
 me.
 Um,
 so
 I
 I'm


just
 going
 with
 this
 is
 the
 prompt
 I'm


using.


This
 is
 this
 is
 what's
 wrong
 with
 the


output.
 Like
 I
 outline
 the
 output
 is


inconsistent.
 Uh
 contains
 too
 many


hallucinations,
 invent
 things
 that
 are


not
 there.


That's
 the
 second
 part.
 And
 then
 I
 uh


it's
 very
 important
 for
 me
 that
 the


prompt
 will
 one
 two
 three
 four
 I
 I
 list


the
 things
 that
 not
 just
 what
 what
 is


wrong
 but
 what
 how
 I
 want
 it
 to
 be
 right


and
 then
 I
 also
 add
 um
 I
 also
 added
 I


give
 it
 permission
 take
 away
 everything


that
 doesn't
 work
 well.
 Yeah,
 you
 can


delete
 things
 from
 my
 prompt.
 You
 can


rewrite
 things
 that
 don't
 work
 well
 and


you
 can
 add
 things
 that
 you
 feel
 are


will
 do
 a
 better
 job
 and
 I
 feel
 like


given
 permission
 to
 change,
 delete,


remove
 whatever
 uh
 provides
 a
 better


output
 because
 otherwise
 and
 chubities


tend
 to
 be
 pleasers.
 They
 may
 try
 to
 uh


use
 your
 prompt
 and
 not
 move
 a
 lot
 out


of
 it
 like
 this
 is
 yours.
 This
 is
 so


great.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 change
 it.
 No,
 I


allow
 you
 to
 change
 it.
 I
 allow
 you
 to


rewrite
 it
 completely.
 And
 I
 tried
 it


several
 times
 on
 several
 prompts,
 not


just
 my
 own.
 People
 are
 coming
 with
 me


with
 why
 does
 my
 custom
 J
 GPT
 act
 so


badly?
 Um
 like
 let's
 let's
 take
 your


prompt
 and
 rewrite
 it
 using
 Chad
 GPT.
 So


I
 go
 with
 that
 template
 and
 and
 like


first
 try
 it's
 amazing.
 first
 try,
 you


get
 a
 a
 prompt
 that
 is
 much
 much
 much


better.
 And
 usually
 it's
 it
 only
 takes


that
 one
 iteration
 for
 it
 to
 work


exactly
 as
 you
 wanted
 it
 to.
 Um,
 so


that's
 my
 tip.


>> I
 I
 love
 it.
 It's
 a
 very
 professional


tip
 um
 that
 I
 will
 use
 in
 my
 moments


where
 instead
 I
 just
 want
 to
 write
 no
 in


all
 caps.
 Uh,
 which,
 you
 know,
 I
 try
 to


pretend
 that
 I'm
 this
 very,
 you
 know,


patient
 and
 sophisticated
 and
 AI


friendly
 prompter,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 more


comfortable
 I
 get
 with
 it,
 the
 more


ridiculous
 my
 my
 [laughter]
 prompts
 get.


So,
 it's
 a
 good
 reminder
 that
 structure


can
 help.
 Well,
 this
 has
 been
 so
 fun.


Where
 can
 we
 find
 you
 and
 how
 can
 we
 be


helpful
 to
 you?


>> Uh,
 you
 can
 find
 me
 in
 LinkedIn.
 Um


I
 am
 linkedin.com/mikalluda


mikall.pelad.


Um
 and
 u
 I
 I
 work
 at
 honeybook.
 So
 you


can
 just
 search
 for
 mik
 pelad
 honey
 and


find
 me.
 I
 would
 really
 love
 to
 connect


with
 anyone
 who
 is
 into
 automations,
 AI,


um
 new
 things,
 whatever.
 I
 want
 to
 see


what
 you
 do.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 what
 you're


working
 on.
 and
 I
 get
 constant

from
 other
 people
 in
 LinkedIn,
 in


Facebook,
 whatever.
 Um,
 I'm
 there
 and


um,


uh,
 from
 you
 um,
 you
 saw
 something
 that


I
 did
 here
 and
 it's
 strike
 you
 with
 a


great
 idea,
 uh,
 a
 way
 to
 improve
 it.
 um


you
 want
 to
 suggest
 things
 that
 I
 can
 do


better
 uh
 or
 even
 if
 you
 want
 more


information
 for
 me,
 just
 feel
 free
 to


reach
 out,
 ask
 questions.
 Um
 I'll
 be


happy
 to
 answer.
 It's
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


things
 to
 talk
 about
 my
 work.
 Um
 so
 feel


free
 to
 do
 that.


>> Well,
 you
 heard
 it.
 Drop
 drop drop


questions
 in
 the
 comments.
 Connect
 on


LinkedIn
 and
 if
 Honeybook
 is
 hiring,
 you


now
 know
 how
 they
 search
 for
 great


candidates.
 So
 if
 you're
 a
 great


>> Yeah,
 we
 are
 hiring.
 Make
 sure
 your


profile
 is
 [laughter]
 well
 well


structured
 and
 well
 well
 made.


>> You
 know,
 maybe
 maybe
 use
 the
 agent
 to


say,
 I'm
 applying
 for
 this
 job.
 Could


you
 find
 me
 on
 LinkedIn
 as
 a
 good
 match


and
 what
 would
 I
 do
 to
 improve
 it?


That's
 the
 last
 tip
 for
 how
 I
