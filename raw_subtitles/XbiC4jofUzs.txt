Oppenheimer
He is called the father of the atomic bomb
but confesses that he is the destroyer of the world
He worked for America in the Manhattan Project
In his later years, he suffered political persecution
How should Oppenheimer be viewed?
Let us talk about Oppenheimer's legendary life today
Oppenheimer was born into an American Jewish family
father is a multimillionaire
He was regarded as a child prodigy from an early age
Proficient in Latin, Greek, German, French since high school
He said to his friend, "Ask me a question in Latin and I will answer you in Greek."
Oppenheimer's childhood favorite pastime was horseback riding in Los Alamos, New Mexico
Since childhood he dreamed of combining two of his favorite things:
Los Alamos and Physics
In 1922, Oppenheimer was admitted to Harvard Chemistry Department
but declined the scholarship
He said I don't need that money to be fine
In college, he was familiar with the history of the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, French literature, and Chekhov's novels
Because I was too focused on seeking knowledge, I never dated a girl in college
After graduation, he decided to study Ph.D. in physics in Cambridge, UK
Because Cambridge was closer to the center of physics research at that time
It was discovered after admission
Cambridge specializes in experimental physics
But Oppenheimer was very bad at doing experiments.
Can't even solder two copper wires together
made him almost depressed
Out of resentment, he actually poisoned the apple of his mentor Patrick Blackett
Afterwards, the school asked Oppenheimer to see a psychiatrist.
I saw several doctors
Physicians find Oppenheimer more capable than themselves
This made Oppenheimer become interested in Freud, self-taught psychoanalysis
His friend, the physicist Pauli, even said
Oppenheimer did "Physics is just a sideline, psychoanalysis is the main business"
But in the movie version, the person who almost ate the poisoned apple was changed to the physicist Bohr
This makes the plot easier to connect
Because Bohr is the founder of quantum mechanics
Oppenheimer became a fan after hearing his speech, saying Bohr was "my God"
He became interested in the emerging quantum mechanics
Decided to transfer to the University of Göttingen in Germany
European Research Center for Theoretical Physics
while in gottingen
Oppenheimer learned to speak Dutch in six weeks
Published 7 articles at the age of 23
These genius deeds have made him a lot of fans
It is also here that I met my opponent who will become the atomic bomb race in the future.
physicist heisenberg
After Ph.D.
Oppenheimer decided to bring the new knowledge of quantum mechanics back to the United States
Taught at the University of Berkeley
It is said that his teaching style makes students unable to follow
Most students take his class more than once
While teaching at Berkeley
He has published articles on various topics
Cosmic rays, electron dynamics, nuclear physics, everything
More and more students worship Oppenheimer
become like a cult
Known as the "Mumbling Boys Gang"
Because Oppenheimer likes to mutter to himself while thinking
But if Oppenheimer is that good
Why didn't you get the Nobel Prize?
Because he has no patience to deal with the same problem for a long time
And always after a new perspective on a problem
Let others continue to study
run away to other problems
So his research is too comprehensive
Inspiring innovation in every field
but did not work long
Make it difficult for him to get the Nobel Prize in Physics
After the Great Depression of 1929
Oppenheimer found that many physics students were unemployed after graduation
And the anti-Semitism in the United States was on the rise
America in the 1920s
Many universities have Jewish quotas
When the Berkeley Physics Department Hired a New Jewish Physics Professor
The dean of the department, Birge, said: It is enough to have one Jew in the department
These practical problems led Oppenheimer to turn to support socialism
Participate in various leftist political activities
California dock workers strike, farm workers strike
Desegregate public swimming pools, organize teachers' unions
These leftist activities were actually the political mainstream in California at the time
also during this period
Oppenheimer met Jane, a communist, at a party
It later became the love of his life
Jane loves the poems of the British poet John Donne
His sonnet "Smash my heart, Trinity God"
later became an inspiration for Oppenheimer
The code name for the atomic bomb test is called "Trinity" (Trinity)
Three-year love affair with Jane made Oppenheimer more left-wing and more politically activism-focused
Once on a train to New York
He brought Marx's three volumes of "Das Kapital"
He had read it all by the time the train arrived in New York
America in the 1930s
Communism is not a particularly radical position
It's more like a synonym for liberalism and democracy.
Because 1936 was the Spanish Civil War
The republican government elected by the Spanish people was defeated by the fascist army in a coup
Therefore, liberals and leftists all over the world hope to resist fascist forces and protect democracy
At that time, 250,000 people joined the American Communist Party
Aid to the Spanish Civil War
Oppenheimer himself never joined the party
But often attend the gatherings of the Communist Party
said at the party
He can always come up with the deepest explanations
Because he has the most thorough understanding of Marx's theory
But also because of being too close to the Communist Party during this period
As a result, after the war, the top US officials and the FBI will use these deeds
Claims Oppenheimer is a fellow traveler of the Communist Party
Until 1939, after the Soviet Union allowed Germany to invade Poland and Stalin began to liquidate his political enemies
Many Communists in the United States are Disillusioned
Although Oppenheimer still yearned for the idea of ​​communism
but no longer believe in the communist party
Instead, make an anti-war manual
Urges the United States not to get involved in the European battlefield
To defend America's Roosevelt New Deal program
This manual later became proof that Oppenheimer was not a communist
Oppenheimer's relationship with Jane lasted three years
But when Oppenheimer proposed
Jane decided to end the relationship
Turned to Pursue His Dream to Become a Psychiatrist
Shortly after
Oppenheimer met a second lover, Kitty
Kitty fell in love with Oppenheimer at first sight
But Kitty was married
Once Oppenheimer invited Kitty and her husband Harrison
Let's go to New Mexico's "Hot Dog Mountain" for summer vacation
It turned out that Kitty's husband couldn't come due to something
So it's just her and Oppenheimer at Hot Dog Hill
after summer vacation
Oppenheimer actually called Kitty's husband and said
Your wife's belly was enlarged by me
I suggest you get a divorce
so i can marry her
(It turns out that this is what Hot Dog Mountain Villa means!?)
In 1939, German chemists successfully demonstrated experiments that could split uranium nuclei
Einstein wrote to President Roosevelt
Warns that "the Nazis may build a new type of bomb that is extremely powerful"
President Roosevelt therefore created an S-1 committee
Recruit the best physicists in the United States
But at this time Oppenheimer was still concentrating on union activities
Believes that scientists have a duty to help the socially disadvantaged
This made Lawrence, the director of the laboratory at the time, very angry
Because these leftist activities make it difficult for him to convince the military
Recruiting Oppenheimer to the Manhattan Project
That's when Oppenheimer realized that if the Nazis were to end
had to join the Manhattan Project
It is also necessary to stop trade unions, political activities
In order for the military to issue him a security clearance
He must sever ties with his communist friends
to serve the country
The key is
Approved by General Groves, head of the Manhattan Project
Gross is the head of the Pentagon Oversight
Graduated from West Point Military Academy fourth in his class
Groves doubted Oppenheimer's qualifications at first
First, he has no Nobel Prize
It doesn't seem right for him to command a group of Nobel physicists
Second, he only has experience supervising graduate students
Lack of leadership management experience
Third, he's just a theorist
It takes engineers to build an atomic bomb
But an idea from Oppenheimer attracted Groves
He believes that scientists in the United States are currently scattered in Princeton, Chicago, Berkeley, etc.
There should be a secret central laboratory in a central location
Bringing the best minds in America to work together
This central laboratory must be hidden in an isolated location
At this moment, Oppenheimer suddenly thought of his favorite childhood place
Los Alamos, New Mexico
Build the world's first nuclear weapons laboratory here
before starting work
Oppenheimer originally wanted to join his close friend Isidor Isaac Rabi
But Rabi refused to say
I don't want weapons of mass destruction to be the pinnacle of physics for 300 years
Rabi wasn't involved in the Manhattan Project
But privately, he's always been a father-like advisor.
Oppenheimer at the time leading the Manhattan Project
Exhibits charismatic and authoritative leadership
informal
Refused to install a time clock
In contrast to General Groves' authoritarian leadership
first progress of plan
Emerged from a conception by physicist Robert Serber
He pointed out that it is possible to shoot a rod of uranium into a block of uranium 235
Trigger a chain reaction by imploding
This became the prototype of the later atomic bomb
Serber's speech was printed as a pamphlet
The Los Alamos Primer
Give each new scientist a copy
The implosion device was designed by Harvard physicist Kistiakowsky
What is not mentioned in the movie is
To build the atomic bomb before Germany
oppenheimer once thought
Adding radioactive material to Germans' food supply chain
But finally gave up on this method
Because he's not sure food poisoning is 'enough to kill 500,000 Germans'
General Groves even sent Moe Berg to assassinate German scientist Heisenberg
When Heisenberg gave a speech in Switzerland in December 1944
Moe Berg waits for a chat, close to Heisenberg
Just when he was about to pull the trigger and shoot Heisenberg
Heisenberg revealed that
The Nazis were a long way from building an atomic bomb
This dissuades Moe Berg that Germany is not a threat at all
Saved Heisenberg's life
However, the development in the United States is not very smooth.
Because General Groves has always adhered to the military's "departmentalized" security principles
In order to keep secret and prevent espionage, separate departments
Do not allow the message to spread easily to other departments
But this hinders scientific research
Because what scientists need is the free flow of information
At that time, the control of the U.S. military was so strict that
Oppenheimer couldn't even talk to his brother on the phone.
Even the drivers and assistants assigned to him are undercover agents of the government
The monitoring once made Oppenheimer consider resigning
June 1943
Oppenheimer gets chance to leave Los Alamos temporarily
back to berkeley
He hopes to take this opportunity to formally say goodbye to Jane
Because Jane's Communist Party status is too sensitive
But the meeting turned out to be the basis for the U.S. government to accuse Oppenheimer of
FBI's Hoover writes to attorney general saying
Oppenheimer's mistress was a Soviet spy
The news reached Boris Pash, then chief of intelligence.
Pash recommends firing Oppenheimer
to add insult to injury is
Oppenheimer also revealed a secret at this time
Turns out before moving to Los Alamos
Oppenheimer once had dinner with his friend Chevalier
Chevalier told Oppenheimer privately:
Physicist Eltenton says he has a technique
Can send your scientific research data to Soviet scientists
Let the United States cooperate with the Soviet Union
Because the United States and the Soviet Union were allies during World War II
Together against Nazi Germany
But information about the atomic bomb is a national defense secret.
How could it be possible for scientists from the two countries to spread it in private?
So Oppenheimer immediately responded to you that this is treason
Chevalier Says He Was Just 'Warning' Someone Wants Oppenheimer's Scientific Data
This Chevalier incident was originally unknown
Oppenheimer himself broke out in Berkeley
Talk to Berkeley Colleagues
Be careful there is a physicist named Eltenton who may steal American technology
This gave Colonel Pash a chance to bring Oppenheimer in for questioning
Unexpectedly, Oppenheimer said in a hurry:
Eltenton also had access to three people from the Manhattan Project
These three people are most likely fictional
It's just Oppenheimer trying to turn his attention to someone else
But the weird thing is that after the trip
Oppenheimer's ex-girlfriend Jane died in mysterious circumstances
In the film, Jane appears to have committed suicide after being abandoned by Oppenheimer
But actually
An autopsy determined the cause of death to be asphyxiation by drowning
And found "trace amounts of chloral hydrate" in her body
Jane was probably drugged and forced to drown in the bathtub
Wait, who would want to kill Jane?
Possibly accusing Jane of being a Soviet spy.
Those who were afraid that Oppenheimer would reveal the news to Jane:
Boris Pash
during that period
Boris Parch just happens to be the director of the CIA
And the seventh branch of his unit
It's the job of assassinations and kidnappings.
in the 1960s
CIA operative tried to kill Castro with poisoned cigar
It's Boris Pash
So Jane's death is probably not suicide, but "suicide"
But Oppenheimer didn't know the truth
After returning to Los Alamos
In December 1943, the physicist Bohr visited
tell oppenheimer a secret idea
You gave people the ability to self-destruct
And the world isn't ready
Bohr believes postwar U.S. nuclear monopoly could lead to nuclear arms race
Stalin should be informed that the Manhattan Project exists
Assuring the USSR that the United States would create an international organization
not a threat
To avoid a postwar nuclear arms race
This idea influenced Oppenheimer's life
Let him devote himself to promoting Bohr's ideas after the war
April 30, 1945 Germany surrenders
hitler committed suicide
some people start to question
America has essentially won the war
Why keep making atomic bombs
The White House position is:
Atom bombing Japan to end WWII
After the war, an international regulatory body was established to regulate atomic energy
Leo Szilard, a physicist at the time of the Manhattan Project, warned top White House officials:
As long as the United States shows the atomic bomb
would trigger an arms race with the Soviet Union
The top White House responded: Don't worry, the Soviet Union has no uranium mines
Szilard organized 155 scientists to sign
Published a "Franck Report":
accuses the U.S. of secretly building nuclear weapons
Bomb Japan without warning
America that did this
How dare you open your mouth and say that you want to abolish the control of nuclear weapons through an international agreement after the war
fundamentally contradictory
Scientists at the time even suggested a compromise
don't bomb japan
Instead, invite Japanese government officials to watch the atomic bomb test explosion
intimidate them
without harming civilians
can end the war again
But Oppenheimer responded that
What if we make an atomic bomb that doesn't explode?
Let the Japanese see our failure with their own eyes
Obviously, at this time, Oppenheimer's position has been clearly on the side of the US government.
Believe the atomic bomb could end war
Save the lives of American soldiers
So on July 16, 1945
The first nuclear test explosion in human history, the "Trinity" project was launched
before the explosion
Oppenheimer told his wife Kitty that if the test was successful
He'll call and tell her you can change the sheets
But on the night of the test explosion, a vision occurred
The atomic bomb was supposed to be detonated at 4 a.m.
But suddenly in the middle of the night it was windy and rainy
All the local frogs gather in the small pond to mate and croak all night long
As a result, the time of the test explosion was delayed by an hour and a half.
Launch at 5:29 AM
The locals said when the atomic bomb exploded
Seeing the night turn into day in an instant
some people laughed
some people cry
But most people are silent
At this moment, Oppenheimer thought of a verse in the Hindu classic "Bhagavad Gita":
"Now I am Death, the Destroyer of Worlds"
After the test explosion
Oppenheimer's secretary called Kitty and said
The sheets can now be changed
After the success of the Manhattan Project
What these scientists don't know is
The US government withheld important information from them
In fact, long before the atomic bomb test
Intelligence units in Washington intercepted a Japanese telegram codenamed "Magic"
Indicates that the Japanese know they have lost the war
Seeking acceptable terms of surrender
At the Spinstan Conference in July 1945
General Eisenhower also proposed
"The Japanese are ready to surrender without having to hit them with atomic bombs"
wait, if japan was ready to surrender
Why did the United States drop the atomic bomb?
It turned out that at the Sponsitan meeting
Stalin said he would join the Pacific War on August 15
But if the Soviet Red Army did invade Japan
After Japan surrendered
The Soviet Union has the same bargaining chip as the United States
You can reap the benefits of the fisherman
So the United States rushed to drop the atomic bomb
In fact, it was to prevent the Soviet Union from occupying Japan after the war.
Prevent Soviet influence from infiltrating the Asia-Pacific region
But the U.S. government withheld this information
keep scientists in the dark
Because if Oppenheimer knew that Japan would have surrendered long ago, World War II would have ended long ago
Will you still insist on the atomic bomb test?
Human history is likely to develop in a different direction
August 14, 1945
Japanese government proposes surrender agreement
After the war Oppenheimer became the most famous man in the world
on the cover of time magazine
as if he was superman who ended the war
But think the United States defeated Japan with the atomic bomb
In fact, it is a completely Western-centric view of history
Historian Takeshi Hasegawa pointed out that
long before the atomic bomb was dropped
Five cities in Japan have been leveled by bombers
The Japanese have long been used to cities being bombed
The atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were merely scaled up
Not enough for Japan to surrender
The real reason Japan surrendered was not the atomic bomb
but because the Soviet Union declared war on Japan
The imminent invasion of Hokkaido
Be the last straw that crushes Japan
The victors deified Oppenheimer as the superman who ended the war
Oppenheimer himself became very critical of science
After the atomic bombs were dropped, "physicists have learned their original sin," he says
During a meeting with President Truman
He said I felt like I had blood on my hands
President Truman replied: "The blood is on my hands, don't worry about it"
Oppenheimer even used his fame to influence the top government
He co-signed a document with more than 300 scientists
refused to assist in the development of bombs
Oppenheimer: 'I'm a scientist, not an arms manufacturer'
These moves prompted President Truman to create the Atomic Energy Commission
But Oppenheimer didn't want U.S. regulation
international control
In accordance with Bohr's ideals, he wrote a report to the U.S. government
call for the establishment of an international atomic energy development agency
That is, the establishment of a world government in the field of atomic energy
Sovereignty over atomic devices
Countries around the world can only use atomic energy for non-military purposes
Because access to information is completely open and transparent
If a certain country wants to secretly build an atomic bomb
will be known all over the world
In 1946, the United States formally proposed the concept of "international control" to the United Nations
The result was immediately rejected by the Soviet Union
The Soviet Union believed that the manufacture and use of atomic weapons should be completely banned
But President Truman certainly couldn't give up America's military superiority
So the proposal of the Soviet Union was rejected
If the United States and the Soviet Union reach an agreement at this time
There would be no Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962
There will be no future arms race
until the 1970s
The U.S. government is only serious about accepting the nuclear arms control agreement
But at this time there are already tens of thousands of nuclear bombs in the world
The ideals of Oppenheimer and Bohr have never been realized in time
in academic work
Oppenheimer invited by Lewis Strauss
Dean of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton
Lewis Strauss has long supported the development of US nuclear weapons
The relationship between the two was very conflicted from the very beginning.
Oppenheimer humiliated Strauss at a hearing
Said that he didn't understand atomic energy science, so he banned the export of isotopes from the United States
when oppenheimer arrived at princeton
Einstein has been working here for 15 years
Einstein is said to have disliked Oppenheimer at first
Because Einstein was disgusted with quantum mechanics
He believes that the essence of the universe should not be probability uncertainty
and the desire to establish a grand unified theory
But as time goes by
Einstein increasingly recognized Oppenheimer
Because he is committed to turning Princeton into a research center for theoretical physics
Talents from all over the world
Recruited 27-year-old Chinese genius physicist Yang Zhenning to Princeton
Later, Li Zhendao was found again.
The two became the first Chinese to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957
The experience of the Manhattan Project also made Oppenheimer realize that
Scientific development is closely linked with political society
So he emphasized that science needs the humanities to guide the direction
invite poet eliot
historian toynbee
philosopher came to princeton as a saberlin
At that time, Princeton gathered almost the smartest people in the world.
But Oppenheimer didn't end up in Princeton
Instead, they were monitored by the government for 20 years
because he had too much political influence on the atomic bomb
Get the attention of the FBI
suspected of being a soviet spy
The FBI begins investigating Oppenheimer's ties to the Soviet Union
first after the war
Communists in San Francisco took the opportunity to claim credit
Said Oppenheimer was one of his own
Come to America again to decipher a Soviet telegram.
Discovery of a Soviet spy Klaus Fuch in the Manhattan Project
Although Klaus Fuch was not recruited by Oppenheimer
But Oppenheimer is the master planner after all.
Then in 1949
Soviet Union conducts secret atomic bomb test in Kazakhstan
shock america
U.S. Congress Decides to Build a Superbomb
Facing the Soviet Union's Nuclear Arms Race
Truman authorized the expansion of the U.S. nuclear stockpile in 1950
After the end of the 1950s
The number of nuclear weapons in the United States has increased from 300 to 18,000
But Oppenheimer turned against the government
Think super bombs should never be built
Humans will be better off
He even used his fame to appear on a TV show
Publicly criticize the President's decisions
These actions against the U.S. government
It makes Oppenheimer more and more like a fellow traveler of the Communist Party
After President Eisenhower took office, he appointed Strauss as the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission
Strauss has been unhappy with Oppenheimer for a long time
I've been looking for evidence that Oppenheimer is the Communist Party in private.
In 1953, Strauss officially launched the plan to destroy Oppenheimer's reputation
Privately collaborated with major newspapers to write articles slandering Oppenheimer
Align with the FBI Director
Trained a young man, Borden, to be a thug to do the dirty work
However, what happened to Oppenheimer is not a special case.
American society at that time
has always been under the shadow of anti-communist McCarthyism
Light is 1953
Hundreds of civil servants were hunted and kicked out of the political circle
April 1954
Strauss holds hearing
Send goon Broden to send the dossier to the FBI
Prosecutors hand-picked
What were the charges against Oppenheimer?
1. Joined countless Communist Party organizations
2. Ex-girlfriend Jane is a Communist
3. Make regular donations to the Communist Party
4. Not reporting the Chevalier incident immediately
In fact, General Groves has long defended Oppenheimer against these allegations.
Groves says
If you will be expelled just because you have friends from the Communist Party
Then the Manhattan Project probably wouldn't be able to find talented physicists.
At the hearing, many of the charges were based on illegally tapped tapes
Oppenheimer's lawyers are not allowed to view
So there is no objection
In ordinary courts, such evidence would not be admissible at all.
So from a legal point of view
this hearing is void
But in the end Oppenheimer accepted the verdict.
Unable to obtain security clearance
Can no longer participate in any defense affairs
after the trial
Strauss also published nearly a thousand pages of the verdict report to humiliate Oppenheimer
The trial aroused the attention of American society
liberals think
Anti-communist hysteria has taken hold of America
America is destroying its own talent
The scientific community considers Oppenheimer a martyr
like galileo against the inquisition
1,100 scientists across the U.S. sign protest
But at this time Oppenheimer was completely disappointed.
Completely disappeared from the public after 1954
Concentrate on doing scientific research at Princeton
Until the 1960s after the Democratic Party came to power
President Kennedy was kind to Oppenheimer again.
The Fermi Award with a prize of 50,000 yuan was awarded to Oppenheimer
symbolic political mundane
This award ceremony is like a redemption ceremony
Confess what the U.S. government owed Oppenheimer
Finally in 1967
Oppenheimer dies of throat cancer from heavy smoking
Looking back on Oppenheimer's 62 years of life
He has almost achieved all his dreams
Pursuit of the most difficult knowledge of quantum mechanics
I also pursued my beloved Jane
even combined a lifelong favorite of physics with the state of New Mexico
Throw yourself into the Manhattan Project and become a national hero
But after the atomic bomb test
His life exploded
My friend Rabi's prophecy came true
"Weapons of mass destruction become the pinnacle of three hundred years of physics"
His favorite childhood place was destroyed
The woman he once loved was assassinated
He was kept in the dark by America
Didn't know WWII ended not because of the atomic bomb
For the rest of my life I thought I was a sinful scientist
He is eager to practice Bohr's philosophy
But it is no match for the reality of the US-Soviet arms race
Finally became a martyr in the anti-communist witch hunt
