Claire Weisner is a graduate of
the University of British
Columbia Okanagan, who led a
study on rage bait as part of
her master's thesis.
And she joins us from Edmonton.
How are you doing?
>> I'm doing well.
How about you?
>> I am doing great.
Let's talk about anger first
with this study.
I guess the first question is
why?
Why did you want to look into
this?
>> Yeah.
So actually in 2020, when Elon
Musk took over what's formerly
Twitter now X, a lot of people
were giving him a really hard
time online.
And he responded a lot of the
time with a laughing, crying
emoji.
So much so that people started
pointing it out.
I read an article like a blog
article pointing out how much
he's been using it in comparison
to other emojis.
If you look up Elon Musk
laughing crying emoji, you'll
get like tons and tons of news
articles about how he's
responded to some sort of
controversy with this emoji.
And I was just really curious,
because that's not what I would
immediately think of as an angry
response.
That's a laughing, crying emoji.
Not like GR, right?
So I was really curious, how are
we expressing, how are we
interpreting anger in this new
space of online like online
spaces in digital landscapes?
>> I didn't even know that.
And I'm trying to think of the
last kind of post that I or
comment that I had, and it was
exactly a laugh and then a
rolling smile.
So now I need to rethink that as
well.
Help us understand, you know,
many of us and as a journalist
as well, many of us have
experienced posting something we
think is innocent online or
something that's informative and
suddenly finding, let's say,
unexpected angry reactions help
us understand.
Do people tend to act or react
more angrily online than they
would perhaps in real life?
>> So yeah.
So anger is a high arousal
emotion, which means that it's
one of the emotions that we're
more incentivised to act upon.
So even if you have 100 eyes on
your post, 25 people are like,
cool, that's that's great.
25 people are like, oh, that
bums me out.
And then 50 people are like, oh,
I'm.
Those 50 people are more likely
than those other 50 people to
comment or engage or share or
talk about it.
Just because it's that high
arousal emotion means that they
want to act.
>> Now, help us understand the
the digital environment itself.
What factors in the environment
contribute to these angry
reactions?
I'm assuming when we talk about
angry comments, angry reactions,
I'm thinking right off the bat
all caps kind of screaming and
yelling, but we know it's as
subtle as something, even in
text messages, as putting a
period at the end of a sentence.
That might just be a
generational thing.
For some people, it could be the
emojis.
But what are the factors in the
digital environment that allow
for this to to kind of fester?
>> Yeah.
So one of the main things is
actually the platform that it's
on.
So you already touched on that.
So in interpersonal
communication, in that texting
environment it's more likely to
be what we call cold anger,
where you're a little bit more
invested in controlling your
image, coming across as very
calm collected and then also
like TikTok is more likely to be
supportive.
That's one of the only places
that I actually found.
When I expected angry comments,
I found a lot of people changing
the narrative, actively deciding
to be supportive.
And then there's anecdotal
evidence that says that
Instagram is more likely to be
angry.
You're more likely to get long
blog posts based off of the
format in Reddit.
So it just again, it depends on
the environment of the actual
platform that you're on, and
then also the social norms of
that platform.
So on Instagram, it's a little
bit more common to bully each
other, whereas TikTok it's a
little bit more common to take
that step and actively be
choosing to be supportive.
>> Can you give us an example of
a story that would be kind of
viewed differently amongst some
of those platforms that you, you
had named?
>> Yeah.
So I actually did my research on
specifically posts that were
about the Canadian housing
crisis.
So one of the things is that
just the post itself was going
to probably be a different
format on Reddit.
It was often a link to an
article or a synopsis of an
article on TikTok.
It could be, for example, the
one with the support that was
just an interview on the street,
and they were like, oh, do you
own a house?
And this young woman said, yes,
I own a house.
But then there's also people
just talking about their
opinions and stuff like that.
So a little bit more.
Not as formal as Reddit, where
they're like, okay, like these
are the facts.
Like these are the news articles
that we're going to be talking
about, you know, try and keep it
grounded, whereas TikTok is a
little bit more, you know,
loosey goosey.
We're just talking about our
opinions, how we feel.
>> All right.
Aside from how people reply to
posts, some outlets appear to do
this intentionally.
Some accounts where what is
known as rage baiting, which
was, from what I understand,
Oxford Dictionaries 2025 word of
the year.
Why not joy baiting or sad?
What is it about rage baiting?
I don't know if I just coined a
term there, but yeah, what is it
about rage baiting?
Why is it about anger?
>> Yeah, I would love joy
baiting.
Yeah.
So again, going back to that
high arousal emotion, it's just
going to make more money.
So we're more likely to get
those clicks, those shares,
those comments, people actually
talking about it.
We there.
The literature suggests that
especially compared to Joy
specifically, we're much more
likely to engage in that active
way with anger than we are with
joy.
So it's just at the end of the
day, it's the bottom line.
What's making us the most money,
especially like in an era of
like influencers, where what the
money that you make depends
quite literally on how much
engagement you're getting on
your post.
It can be very effective to
upset people and get them to
engage with you on that level.
>> Can you give an example?
I'm thinking of joy baiting.
I'm thinking of cats, I love
cats, I have a cat at home
thinking of these cute videos
and then rage baiting.
What?
Give me some examples of what
people might be used to seeing
when it's when when we consider
something as rage baiting.
>> Yeah, a lot of the rage bait
that I encountered was about
immigration, because, again,
that Canadian housing crisis.
And so just broad statements
that aren't necessarily grounded
in reality about immigration and
politics, just really, really
broad statements that can kind
of make anyone angry.
It doesn't necessarily matter
where you land on the political
spectrum just because it's, you
know, not necessarily grounded
in fact, but it is a very, very
emotional subject and it often
is a little bit offensive.
>> Well, let's talk about let's
use immigration as an example.
You know, something that, as you
said, kind of grew online.
But we did see protests, you
know, on both sides of the coin
on that conversation across the
country, are we increasingly
exposed to hot anger online?
And what impact does that have?
Sort of in our real world?
I think a lot of us think that
it is kind of protected, sort of
on the, on the.com.
But there is are we seeing
spill-over?
>> Yeah.
So we like you said, we're a
little bit we feel a little bit
protected.
It's called like a social
isolation idea where we can't
see the other person on the
screen.
So they kind of stop being real.
And the consequences are we
don't think of them.
So whereas in person, I might be
less likely to scream and yell
at someone who disagrees with
me.
I'm more likely to do that
online just because the
consequences of how they
perceive me, of my, you know,
social standing is aren't in
peril from this engagement.
I do think that we are a little
bit seeing spill-over, but there
is still those social mores that
inhibit us from behaving poorly
in person in a way that we don't
see in online spaces.
So a lot of people will like,
talk about like in these online
spaces.
I, I thought that this was
really normal.
And then I came out of it and it
like and I talked to real people
and you know, it's a lot more
nuanced than maybe I'd initially
thought.
>> With that being said, are we
becoming an angrier society?
>> I couldn't say that's
definitely a little bit out of
the scope of my research, but
definitely we are becoming more
comfortable with being
aggressive with each other in
online spaces specifically.
>> All right.
My last question to you is, you
know, for someone for a lot of
people who are on their phones
probably watching this segment
on their phones as well, what
advice would you give to
ordinary folks who are feeling
the weight of online anger on a
daily basis?
What can we do?
>> Yeah, definitely.
Number one, step back.
Try and remember that the person
on the other end is also a
person.
That's something that I always
have to remind myself that
they're not necessarily doing
this with the intention of
hurting me.
They just aren't thinking about
me as a person.
They're thinking about me as
this, you know, empty canvas of
internet.
And also just remember who's
profiting off of what you are,
what makes you angry.
So if you see something and it
really, really upsets you, who
makes money off of that?
And if it's if you can identify
that, then maybe it's not worth
engaging with.
>> All right, Claire, really
appreciate your insights.
Thank you so much.
And yeah, let's maybe we'll
watch.
My phone's been listening, so
I'll get lots of cat videos I'm
hoping outside of this.
So appreciate it.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you so much.
Have a good day.
