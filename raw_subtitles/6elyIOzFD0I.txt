This sounds like a crazy fucking thing to say on a podcast in 2025. How do we start a conversation with another human being? I've got a favorite technique that I use. And it requires courage. And it's a game, simple game, called "Hi-Lo Buffalo". "Hi" is something that's going great for you. "Lo" is something that's not so great for you. "Buffalo" is something interesting about you. Do you say it to them that we're going to do "Hi-Lo Buffalo"? I play this game with people I meet that I want to connect with. Say you've been working with Susan for 12 months. Just sit down with Susan and go, "Susan, I know this is a bit crazy. Listen to a guy name. Vin on Dara over CEO, he said, "If you want to connect with someone and you care about the connection, play a game called 'Hilo Buffalo'. Are you game? Play." I'm giving three opportunities for a conversation to spark, but in actuality there are six threads here because there's three from me, there's three from you. You just gave me three things. I've got three threads to choose from.
