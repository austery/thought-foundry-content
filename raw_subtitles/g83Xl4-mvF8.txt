So I'm a philosopher
at the University of Notre Dame,
where I teach a very popular
course on the good life.
In my career, I have corrupted thousands
of youth with philosophy.
And tonight, I’m here
to try to corrupt you
with what I think is one
of the most important,
but least appreciated ideas
in the philosophy of the good life today.
Most major philosophers
and nearly every major world religion
puts the virtue of love
at the center of the good life.
But what exactly does it mean
to practice this virtue?
To get my students thinking about this,
I give them a thought experiment.
Suppose I had a pill,
and if you took it,
it would cause you to experience love
for absolutely anyone you met.
Would you take it?
I’ve asked this to thousands of students,
and the answer I overwhelmingly get
from my very earnest,
very Catholic freshmen is: no.
They wouldn't take
the "love everyone" pill.
And in hearing their answers,
I start to get some insight into how
they're thinking about this virtue.
One of the most profound
answers I ever heard
was from a 19-year-old guy
I taught a couple of years ago.
Let's call him Chris,
to protect his identity.
When Chris raised his hand
to tell me why he wouldn't take
the "love everyone" pill,
I half expected him to say something like,
"Professor, losers don't deserve my love."
But instead, he said something
that was actually pretty deep.
He said, "Professor,
I sleep with my cell phone
across my bedroom at night.
And sometimes it goes off
in the middle of the night.
And I wake up and I think,
’Oh my God, something’s
happened to my mom.′
And I feel sick to my stomach
until I can get to the phone and answer it
and know that she's OK.
Feeling that way about everyone,
that would be unbearable for me."
Chris has his finger,
attention in how we think about love.
Love is essential to the good life,
but it's also risky, dangerous,
it can even be downright unbearable.
One thing that's kind of funny
is we have all these complex thinkings
about the virtue of love,
but when it comes to hate
and resentment, those are easy.
We can absolutely cultivate those.
In fact, our current
politics, the internet,
it has us taking a "hate everyone" pill
just about voluntarily every day.
There are a lot of philosophers
that are trying to figure out a way
out of this current chaos.
And in my field of ethics,
one of the hottest topics right now
is the virtue of civility.
What we need to teach people
is how to turn down their feelings,
how to have more sophisticated
political conversations,
and how to coexist with other people
who they disagree with.
Now in 2,400 years of philosophy,
I can think of no major thinker
who thinks civility is a cardinal virtue.
Civility, it's a virtue,
but like a third tier,
division-three virtue at best.
(Laughter)
Love, on the other hand,
love is the deep magic.
The philosophers that I study
think the virtue of love is crucial
for our ethical and social health.
The tough thing is figuring out
how to get yourself
to take that love pill.
So to get us on that track,
I want to introduce you guys
to two of the greatest
ancient philosophers of love
who don't agree on everything,
but have some deep insights
that we need to recover
to get out of our current mess.
The first philosopher
is Aristotle of Macedonia.
He taught his course
on the good life 2,400 years ago,
and his big idea was that love
is not just a feeling
that happens inside of you.
When you love another person,
you experience them as another self.
Love has the power to dissolve
the membrane between yourself
and another person.
When you love someone
and they achieve something great
or they have extraordinary virtue,
Aristotle thinks those achievements
and virtues, they come into yourself.
When you love someone
and they do something shameful
or they have vice,
that comes into you.
Aristotle thought for those reasons
you should be super careful who you love.
You shouldn't want any potentially
bad stuff to come into yourself.
About 500 years later,
another great philosopher
comes on the scene
and he innovates this debate.
This is Jesus of Nazareth.
Now a lot of people don’t think
of Jesus as a philosopher,
but if you read the Gospels,
he is getting into philosophical
disputes all the time
that rival the ones the ancient
Greek philosophers are having.
The best one, I think,
comes in the Gospel of Luke.
Jesus gets a question
from a Jewish ethicist.
The core of the good life
in Judaism is loving God
and loving others as another self.
And the ethicist asks Jesus,
what does this mean?
And Jesus responds
with a thought experiment.
One day this man is walking down
the road from Jerusalem to Jericho
when some robbers come upon him,
they strip him naked,
take all of his stuff and beat him
within an inch of his life.
They leave him to die
by the side of the road.
Two men walk by, they notice
the man dying by the side of the road,
and they're unmoved, they just walk on by.
A third man comes around, a Samaritan,
and he sees the man,
and his guts move inside of him.
The Greek word in the Gospel of Luke
that we’re given is “splagchnizomai,”
his guts churn inside of him.
In the ancient world
strong emotions like love,
they didn't live in your heart.
They lived in your intestines.
If you wanted to make someone
an ancient philosophy-inspired Valentine,
you wouldn't cut them out a heart.
You would literally cut them out
a coil of intestines
and like, a liver and a kidney
and give it to them.
That's where love lived.
The Samaritan loved in his guts.
And he stopped and he helped the man,
he nursed him back to health all night.
Aristotle thought that what
connects us with other people,
what dissolves that membrane,
is expectation of virtue and achievement.
But Jesus thought,
what dissolves the membrane,
what really connects us
with other people is vulnerability.
And what's interesting about connecting
with people on vulnerability
is that you can do it
with absolutely anyone.
We might not all be physically beaten up,
laying, dying by the side of the road,
but we've all been beaten up by life.
We all have some element
of that beaten man inside of us,
and that is where the love
connection can happen.
You don't have to take my word for it.
I think one of the most interesting
studies in social psychology,
30 years ago, Arthur Aron
did this amazing experiment
where he showed that he could cause
strangers to love each other
in a lab in under an hour.
And here was the experiment.
He'd pair people up,
and he would have them
ask each other questions
that required them
to be increasingly vulnerable.
It would start with simple questions
like, who’s someone
you’d like to have dinner with?
And end with questions like,
which member of your family would you
be most disturbed to discover had died?
People reported, 30 percent
of participants in the Aron's study,
reported feelings of closeness
that rivaled how they felt
towards their most intimate partners
and towards their best friends.
Vulnerability has the ability
to cause these connections.
I don't know about you guys,
but I feel like, especially
in the last decade,
we have been living through a period
of what I would call ethical constipation.
(Laughter)
We have to get our guts moving again,
and we're not going to be able to do that
with better political discussions,
more abstractions, separating
ourselves from each other.
We have got to learn to connect,
and we've got to learn
how to do it through our vulnerability.
Guys like Chris that I teach
at Notre Dame,
they think that their
splagchnizomai makes them weak.
But I think that this feeling in our guts,
this kind of love, this connection,
it's the surest sign
that we are on the road to the good life.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
