You're listening to
(MIS)Treated, I'm Nam Kiwanuka.
Did you know that up until 1993
women weren't included
in clinical trials
in the United States.
It would take Canada
a few more years
to include women in
clinical trials in 1997.
So, I'm a music lover and
I'm probably showing my age,
but these were some of the
biggest songs in 1993.
Sheryl Crow -
"All I Wanna Do",
is just have some fun.
Salt 'n' Pepa -
"Whatta Man'.
Meatloaf -
"I'd Do Anything For Love".
And "Insane in the Brain"
from Cypress Hill.
In short,
1993 wasn't that long ago.
But that's decades of
research opportunities
that have been lost,
and women suffer for it.
And this exclusion has had a
huge impact on women's health.
So, why are clinical trials
important?
They help us find new approaches
to medicine,
and to deepen our understanding
of how to treat illnesses.
Less than 10 years ago,
scientists didn't even use
female mice in their research
until the National Institutes
of Health, in 2016,
mandated that researchers
include female mice
in their trials.
The assumption was that, quote,
"Females would respond the same
way as males in drug trials."
And some researchers avoided
conducting studies
on female mice because
their fluctuating hormones
could make their test results,
quote, "messy".
As a result, historical bias
and the absence of research
has caused a systemic
lack of understanding
about women's health,
which has created a huge
gender gap in healthcare.
Women are twice as likely to
experience adverse affects
from medication.
Women are less likely to receive
appropriate prevention
and management
of heart diseases
which, by the way,
is the leading cause of death
globally for women.
And one study found that women
in 900 different disorders
are diagnosed 3.7 years later
than men.
So, why did it take until 1993
for women to be included
in clinical trials in the US,
and another four years
to be included in Canada?
And what's changed since?
We'll be talking about all that
and more with our guest today -
Dr. Michelle Cohen.
She's a family physician
and assistant professor
in the Department of Family
Medicine at Queen's University.
She joins me now.
♪
Dr. Michelle Cohen,
welcome to the podcast.
Thank you so much.
We've been following each other
over the years on social,
it's the first time
we're meeting in person.
So it's really nice.
Yeah, it's great, it's great.
So, today we're talking about
the history of women's exclusion
in clinical trials.
But before we get into that
let's get back to
the very basics.
What is a clinical trial?
So, a clinical trial is
a very carefully monitored
set of experiments
that are designed to test
what potential treatments
will do in people.
So we can study things in
a petri dish or in the lab,
you can figure out
how one, you know,
molecule interacts
with another one,
but you can't ever really be
sure what it's going to do
in a human body because
humans are so complicated.
So, clinical trials are the way
that we test how a potential
treatment will actually work.
Is it effective
the way we want it to be?
Is it safe?
Are there problems or
side effects or, you know,
risks that
we aren't aware about?
Mm, so they're very important
in the sense of how they, uh,
human beings react to them.
Yes, absolutely.
Are they just for
developing drugs?
Uh, developing drugs
but also procedures as well,
so surgical procedures or
medical devices, implants,
pretty much anything that
you would use as a therapeutic
or any type of treatment
for a condition,
or even for preventative
strategies as well,
preventing certain diseases.
You know, you need data from
a clinical trial to tell you
is it worth it, is it worth
the pros versus the cons
or the risks
versus the benefits,
and is this something that
we want to implement
on a wide scale and
offer to patients.
So, understanding
their importance...
Mm-hmm?
Why then have women been
historically excluded
from clinical trials?
So, there's been a historical
tendency to kind of ignore women
anyway when it comes to
developing ideas
around how the body works.
Or maybe 'ignore'
is not the right word,
maybe it's more thinking of
the male body,
or the cis male body
in particular,
as sort of the default or
the kind of human standard,
normal neutral human standard.
So, when research gets done it's
often... has been traditionally,
and still currently,
done on the sort of
neutral human body standard.
And then everything is
sort of extrapolated to women.
So, part of the problem is that
women were seen as different
or, you know,
kind of a substandard form
of a human body.
And also the complaint or
the problem was offered, um,
that women have hormones,
hormonal cycles,
you know, women
who are menstruating
are going to have their cycles
change throughout the month.
There are potentially issues
with pregnancy,
it can change hormones
even more.
Then if you have a pregnant
person enrolled in a study
you're dealing with two people
affected by a medication
or treatment
instead of just one.
Complaints were offered as a way
to disregard the importance
of including women in trials,
and just saying,
"Well, you know, we can just
kind of do the trials
"on the standard that
we've already decided
"is like the default
human being
"and then we'll just sort of
extrapolate that to women
"because, you know,
it doesn't matter as much."
Just listening to
what you've just said,
all the complexities of women's
bodies, the hormones, pregnancy,
all these, that sounds
a lot more complicated
than a default
so-called human body.
Yeah, yeah,
absolutely, absolutely.
So, in the interim,
when you have, um...
'Cause I think for a while
they also considered women
to just be small men?
Yeah. (Nervous chuckling)
Yeah.
Small substandard men,
basically.
Just sort of a weaker,
more inferior version
of the male body.
Um, so just sort of a man
but with, you know, a uterus
and some troublesome hormones
created by these
troublesome ovaries.
Or there's actually a quote
that's been attributed
to one of the pioneers,
1800s pioneers of medicine,
Rudolf Virchow,
who supposedly said,
"A man is a human
with some testes,
"and a woman
is a pair of ovaries
"with a human being
attached."
Oh my God.
(Both laughing)
Where's the chair? I want to
throw it against a wall.
Yeah,
absolutely, absolutely.
So it gives you a real
indication of kind of how...
..Victorian medical men
conceived of women,
thought of women's bodies,
and this was the foundation
upon which much of the
modern medical system is based,
the sort of theoretical basis
that, you know,
women are just like
body parts assembled...
You start with, like,
the reproductive organs
and everything is kind of
rearranged around that.
But this actually
creates an environment
where there's a lot of harm
that is perpetuated
by not acknowledging
that women's bodies are
different from male bodies.
In the 1970s,
there was a push from women
to be included in trials.
What was their argument then?
So, the argument then
was kind of based around
the Thalidomide scandal.
That Thalidomide was a drug
that was used as a sedative,
and for morning sickness
in pregnancy,
in the late '50s
and early '60s.
And after a few years in use
it was taken off the market
because,
in multiple different countries,
it caused a lot of problems
with birth defects
and pregnancy losses,
and it's not a safe drug
to use in pregnancy.
So, very quickly it was removed
from the market.
And in the '70s
the push was...
..the push from the
medical research perspective
was we just can't include women
in at least early
clinical trials at all.
Can't include women of
reproductive age.
Or I think the phrasing was, you
know, "potential for pregnancy",
"childbearing potential".
Which basically means
anyone who's menstruating.
It's a huge,
huge range in age, you know.
So if there's a potential
that you could get pregnant
then you should be excluded
from these studies
because potentially that could
affect the pregnancy.
Which sounds like
a reasonable thing.
But then, what does that create?
So, you can't just remove a
whole chunk of human beings
from a set of studies. You know?
It really limits what we learn
about women's bodies.
It perpetuates this idea of
women's bodies
as being special,
different, mysterious,
controlled by hormones,
controlled by
reproductive organs.
Primarily for
the purpose of pregnancy.
You know,
even women who are single,
or in a relationship
where they're not going to get
pregnant, or on birth control.
Husbands who have
had vasectomies.
Husbands who have
had a vasectomy.
You know, with a partner who's
not going to get you pregnant,
or just not with
a partner at all
and maybe you've
had your tubes tied.
Whatever,
there are lots of situations
where someone could say,
"Hey, my risk of pregnancy
is super, super low,
"or basically zero" but because
of the child-bearing potential,
you know, that model would
still see them removed
from clinical studies.
So, you know, on the one hand,
yeah, we want to be careful
when we enrol someone who could
potentially become pregnant
or is pregnant in a study,
but that doesn't mean that
we should be excluding
a major group of the population.
And also pregnant people
do deserve to have
evidence-based care as well.
So, even the framing that
pregnant people shouldn't be
involved in clinical studies
alone is kind of problematic,
because really we should be
looking to collect evidence
on all types of bodies,
on all groups of people.
It should be just a part of
scientific pursuit
to be interested in things
that we don't know,
and trying to get
more information
about things
we don't know.
And likewise with medicine.
We should be trying to provide
the best evidence-based care
that we can.
And we can't do that if we just
eliminate a group of people
from clinical trials,
or at least from the early
stages of clinical trials.
So that was kind of the framing
in the late '70s that, okay,
we just have to exclude everyone
who could theoretically
potentially become pregnant
because, you know,
they're just too special
a category
and we want to protect
potential pregnancy.
Mm.
Well, this thing, the next thing
that I'm going to say
just kind of blew my mind
when I found this out.
In the 1970s,
the first clinical studies
on the effects of oestrogen,
the sex hormone responsible
for female physical features
and reproduction,
were done on men.
Yeah, yeah.
(Laughing)
Uh, say what now?
Yeah. I know,
it's pretty ridiculous.
Um, and it's hard to
hear that stat
and not to have, like,
an emotional reaction.
Keeping in mind that clinical
trials did not begin and end
in the 1970s.
And we're talking about
from--
What we're talking about
is from the time
from the first recorded trials
in 500 BC to right now.
What has been the long-term harm
caused by women's exclusion
from clinical trials?
So, we know less about diseases
and how they affect
women's bodies.
We know less about treatments.
We know less about, you know,
efficacy, drug dosing,
appropriate dosing,
risks of certain treatments.
We're just providing
an entire group of people,
really half the population,
substandard therapy
because we just don't know
enough about it.
There are also some conditions
that primarily or predominantly
affect women, and if we don't
enrol women in clinical trials
we're just deciding that those
diseases just don't matter.
So there's a saying I think
about sometimes, uh,
"You measure what you treasure."
Mmm.
It's really a reflection of
how we do medical research
and how it reflects
our priorities,
or how it speaks to our
priorities. You know?
If you're not measuring
a disease
that predominantly
affects women,
or predominantly affects
certain racialized groups,
you're basically just saying,
"Well, that disease
doesn't matter.
"We just don't care about
that population.
"We just don't care about
improving their quality of life,
"or lengthening their lifespan."
Or acknowledging their pain.
Acknowledging their pain,
absolutely,
providing effective treatment,
making people feel better.
You know, just decided, "Well,
we're not going to look into it
"so that group just doesn't
really matter to us."
So it's a reflection of
our priorities as a society
on the whole.
Um, I don't know if you're a fan
of Nicole Kidman, I am a fan.
I will watch anything
that Nicole Kidman is in.
But do you remember that show,
I think it's called

Big Little Lies?
I didn't see it,
but I remember.
So, I've been rewatching it
'cause my nervous system,
I just want to rewatch things
that I already
know the endings too.
(Both laughing)
And in it there's a storyline
where she takes a sleeping aid.
Mm-hmm.
And she doesn't understand why
she ended up, like, driving,
and in the middle of the woods
in an accident.
It keeps happening.
Mm-hmm.
And there was a sleeping aid
that the dose was
only tested on men,
so when women took it
they actually did
end up in accidents.
And that just kind of
blew my mind that
something that can potentially
put you in a situation
where you could die
is just like,
"Oh, well, you know,
just give them the same dose."
Yeah, exactly.
Oh, well, you know,
at least we protected the
child-bearing potential
of these women in our studies.
You know?
Absolutely, absolutely.
It's pretty ridiculous.
Yes.
But it's absolutely
the kind of thing that happens.
We diagnose certain diseases
less, you know.
The example of heart attacks
in women is a really good one,
it's been used a lot, and
discussed a lot by cardiologists
and female cardiologists
in particular, that we...
..there was around
the mid-20th century
this big explosion in
research around heart attacks.
And a big concern for men,
middle-aged men,
dropping like flies, they're
having all these heart attacks
in the prime of their life
and they're being cut down
by heart attacks.
And so there was a lot of effort
put into research and treatment
around heart attacks,
which is definitely
really important.
And we've improved
survivability,
we've improved prevention
when it comes to heart disease.
But we still are focusing
primarily on the male population
and we are ignoring the fact
that women also have heart
attacks in pretty large numbers.
It's still a major contributor
to mortality
and morbidity for women.
And yet, when women have chest
pain, or the type of chest pain,
or heart attack symptoms,
that's often classified as
atypical symptoms,
or atypical presentation
of a heart attack.
Treatments are not tested
on women to the same degree.
Same thing with
prevention strategies.
So we're basically saying
like, yeah,
heart attacks are important
but we only really care about
when they happen in men.
And when they happen in women,
well, you know,
we'll just kind of...
..we'll extrapolate from the
studies that we've done on men,
or we'll extrapolate
from what we know
about how men present to
the emergency room
with a heart attack,
and we'll just hope that
that's good enough for women.
And it's not,
it's definitely not.
It's actually
quite frightening.
'Cause for men we know if you
are experiencing a heart attack
one of the symptoms
is like the arm.
Mmhmm.
But for women it presents itself
completely different.
Right, atypical,
yeah, exactly.
It'll be a different
sort of presentation,
and then that makes it difficult
from the perspective of, say,
an emergency room doctor who's
trained with a certain idea
of what a heart attack is.
And then, if a woman comes in
with a different set of symptoms
then that just goes down...
..you kind of go down from
a diagnostic perspective
a different sort of pathway
of what...
Okay, she doesn't have the
sort of typical chest pain
radiating down to the arm
and into the jaw.
Might be more like nausea,
or dizziness,
or those types of symptoms.
And that's not on your radar
as something that you think
might be going on,
then you're more likely to say,
"Oh well, you know,
"it's probably nothing,
or maybe it's anxiety."
Which is a very common complaint
that many women have,
which is absolutely
backed up by research,
that coming into an
emergency situation
with different types of
presentations or pain
often gets kind of pushed off
as anxiety, panic, you know,
mood issues, whatever,
kind of brushed off.
Not that those things are
not important as well
but, you know, if you miss a
heart attack by just saying,
"Well, you know, you need to
maybe just take a pill and relax
"or go see your doctor
and talk about your mood,"
then you're going to end up with
women dying who,
if they presented in a different
way or in a male body,
might've been recognized
and might have been treated
more appropriately.
So this is like
a big consequence
when we miss these things,
and when we just kind of
brush things off
because we're taught to think of
typical chest pain
and not atypical chest pain as a
presentation for heart attack.
It wasn't until 1993 that
the United States put into law
that women and, I hate
this word, 'minorities',
so-called minorities be included
in clinical trials.
What's been the effect of that
decision more than 30 years on?
So there has be-- It's been
slow progress basically,
is the way to sum it up.
There has been more inclusion of
women into clinical trials.
But women's health research
is still majorly underfunded,
under resourced, there's just
not as much interest,
there's not as much drive
to study diseases
that affect women.
And then, diseases that
are studied tend to be,
what we call,
the bikini conditions.
So, reproductive organs and
breast disease. You know?
We don't look into things like
why do women have higher rates
of autoimmune disorders?
We just don't know.
Which is not a really good way
of looking into the problem,
there's not, again,
this comes back to the
"you measure what
you treasure". You know?
Do we care about why women
have higher rates
of auto-immune disorders
from a societal perspective?
We don 't really
because we're not looking into
it at the same degree.
So there's definitely been
progress in the last few decades
but we're not
where we need to be,
not even close to
where we need to be.
1993, more than 30 years,
now women are included
in clinical trials.
How has this policy changed,
pushed forward our understanding
of women's health?
It definitely helps.
But, again, it's just
one small step. You know?
We're still... we need more
interest in women's conditions,
we need more funding.
Going back to, you know,
in the last 30 years
there's been more women
moving into medicine
and moving into
medical science
but we're still not seeing
enough women in leadership.
And in leadership,
in medical leadership,
in research leadership, that's
where those decisions get made
about what studies get funded,
what grants are given out,
what the focus of a particular
department is going to be
if they're going to participate
in clinical research.
So, you know--
How do we get more women
into these positions?
How do we get more women in
leadership in general, you know?
Like it's a lot of the same
kind of glass ceiling
sort of problems in medicine.
Um, it's that it becomes
difficult for women
to get into
positions of leadership
because it's often
very demanding timewise,
very demanding, there's
the motherhood penalty.
You know, if you take some time
away for maternal leave,
parental leave, you know, that
is seen as a strike against you.
There's also research showing
that women who don't have kids
are still subject to
the motherhood penalty
because there's an assumption
that they have kids
or that they will
someday have kids.
So still kind of this
negative association.
There's lots of evidence
of gender bias
when it comes to just
deciding who, you know,
with hiring committees,
or promotional committees,
deciding who's going to
get a certain role.
So we see what's called
the leaky pipeline.
You've got lots of women
moving into medicine
at the lowest level,
like the medical school level.
Like we have much higher numbers
of women
matriculating into med school,
that's been true over
the last generation or so,
a quarter century.
But then, at every stage of
leadership we lose women.
So, you know, when it comes to
head of a department
you lose a certain
number of women.
Or any kind of
research leadership
we lose a certain
number of women.
And then,
when you get to the top
things like who are the
deans of medical schools,
there have only been a handful
compared to the number of
medical schools that we have.
Leadership in terms of
medical associations,
and likewise with research.
So there's just only a few
that make it to the top,
and a few are not enough.
We need a n-- We need
better representation.
A plurality of women
would be great.
Having actual equitable
representation would be ideal,
but we don't... we're pretty
far off from that goal.
But even just having
more women,
uh, more women representing also
underrepresented communities.
So, more Black and Indigenous
women would be fantastic,
that's a huge problem as well
in medicine.
Those communities are
very underrepresented.
And so, likewise,
our research does not reflect
the interests of the people
who are in leadership.
Like the interests of people
who are in leadership
but not the people
who need the research most.
And I guess, too, there's a case
to be made for lived experience
because if you are a woman and
maybe have dealt with fibroids,
endometriosis,
have experienced menopause,
then those are things
that you are more...
..you feel those things,
and you wonder,
"Why hasn't this thing
been studied?"
Um, you know, it feels as if
there's so much change happening
right now in the world.
What's happening in the US with
President Trump's second stint
as President,
a lot's happening.
And, earlier in 2025,
the United States
came close to gutting
the Women's Health Initiative,
which is a long-term study
which was started in 1991.
It focuses on preventing
a variety of diseases
and disorders for
post-menopausal women.
The study has led to
discoveries in women's health
on everything from chronic
illness, osteoporosis, cancer,
and hormone therapy,
and more.
Did that near-miss send
a bit of a... a chill, like,
throughout the scientific
community of what was going--
..the repercussions?
Yeah, absolutely.
And we still-- They've backed
away from their statement
that they were going to
cut a bunch of funding,
but they haven't really
made it very clear
what's going to happen.
So it's in that sort of,
you know, uncertain state
that's true of a lot of
the US Government right now.
There's sort of
a lot of uncertainty
about what's going
to happen next.
And so, yeah,
the Women's Health Initiative
is kind of in that
category of, you know,
they said they were
going to gut it,
then they kind of backed away
a little bit a few days later.
But it's still unclear
what the status actually is.
So it's a bit of a TBD,
we don't really know.
But it is pretty scary, um,
similar to what's been going on
just throughout the US
in terms of medical research,
there's been a lot of gutting,
and cuts,
and affecting medical research
and public health.
So it's a scary environment
right now anyway
where we just don't really know
what's happening.
But definitely for
women's health watchers, um,
people who work
in women's health,
the potential loss of
the Women's Health Initiative
is quite scary, too.
We're talking a lot about the
United States in this episode.
How is Canada doing in this?
(Inhaling sharply) Um, you know,
Canada is not a pioneer
when it comes to
women's health research.
You know, I'd say
we're probably similar
to a lot of other
Western countries.
There was a recent study
looking at how much
women's health issues get funded
in terms of medical research,
and it's still like
something like 6%.
Like it's in the single digits
in terms of all research.
So we're in the single digits
percentage wise
when it comes to where our
research funding gets allocated
in terms of health issues.
And so, I would say we're not,
you know,
Canada is not particularly
a champion
of women's health research.
There's still a lot
left to be desired.
When the new budget comes out
that there are going to be cuts
to women's programs.
Um, like income equity,
gender-based violence,
reproductive rights,
and these have knock-on effects
in terms of women's health
as well.
So, I'm a little concerned
that we might actually be
going backwards
when it comes to
women's health in Canada.
I should mention that the NIH
oversees the
Women's Health Initiative.
Um, it's a little chilling
to hear that
because it feels as if
this could be an opportunity
for Canada to actually step up
if we are indeed
a feminist nation.
The Federal Government
should at least
be trying to
fill in those gaps.
A lot of US doctors
and scientists
are looking to leave
the United States.
Would them coming here
help with the efforts to
study women's health?
It would help if there's money,
you know, if there's funding.
Like, research always
comes down to funding
and the finite amount
that is available for research.
So, resources in terms of
people power, that's fantastic,
but then research grants
is the other part of it.
So I think it's hopeful,
I definitely would love
a brain drain that works,
you know, in our favour.
And absolutely this would be a
great time for Canada to step up
on the medical research stage,
not just in women's health
but just more broadly.
We'll see what happens,
we'll see what happens.
What are your hopes going
forward for clinical trials
in women's health?
So, I would--
Well, first of all,
I would hope that
whatever Ottawa's deciding
in terms of funding
for women's programs
that decision is reversed,
and that we don't have
massive cutbacks
in terms of women's programming,
like it seems we are going to.
And then, we need
an influx of interest
in terms of research grants
and bodies,
and people who are
interested in women's health.
I think there is an interest
because, again,
we have more women
moving into medicine,
we have more women moving slowly
into positions of authority,
leadership, and research,
and medicine.
So there is a drive there.
But we need the resources.
So, more funding,
more resources,
and just an expectation,
I think.
We should have an expectation,
as a society,
that women's health
is a priority,
and that women's health research
is not just sort of
like an after thought
after we deal with
the important issues.
Um, you've been somebody
in this space
who's long advocated for
the well-being of women.
And from the stories
that I've been hearing
from a lot of people, um,
their pain is just normalized.
And it's... You have to figure
out how to navigate a system
where it's just tol-- You're
being told on a consistent basis
that it's not that bad,
um, you have to wait,
it's not what it is.
And it can end up being
a very lonely experience.
So what do you say to women who
are trying to navigate a system
where historically
we've done such a poor job?
And sometimes, like, your doctor
might not be able to give you
the information you need,
and then you end up
in the disinformation
and misinformation rabbit hole
of the internet.
Yeah, yeah.
So, yeah, trying to--
Like the online health discourse
is full of just nonsense.
You know? It's just like a
firehose of good information
and bad information, and it's
really hard to figure out
what's the right information.
So it's hard, especially if
you are, as you say, isolated,
maybe in a situation
where you're disempowered,
where you don't know what's
going on with your body,
where you're not
getting good answers
from the people around you or
from the people you should trust
to take care of you.
So, it's a very difficult
situation to be in.
I would just hope that
one of the good things
about the internet has been to
connect people who perhaps have,
or are feeling isolated,
or might have
a more rare condition,
or might be in a place
where they're, you know,
in a more remote location
where it's harder to
connect with other people
who perhaps have
the same condition,
going through the
same sort of thing.
So, to find groups online
that can be like a
patient advocacy resource
is very helpful.
You know, again with the caveat
that sometimes that leads to
less helpful information.
Sometimes a bit of
wellness disinformation
or, you know, um,
there are certainly
a lot of health grifters
that will seek out
those spaces as well
where people are vulnerable
and opening themselves up,
and talking about the
experiences that they have.
So that's difficult.
Um, you know,
to suggest what people do.
Like finding a resource that you
can trust is the most important.
How to find someone that
you can trust is difficult.
Definitely
science-based information
is going to be
the most helpful.
So, finding something
that is grounded in science
rather than something that
presents itself as contrarian
sort of or heterodox, or,
you know, the science--
Like the one weird trick of
the internet. You know?
Your doctor doesn't
want you to know this.
Or like, "Here's the secret
that everyone's been hiding."
Like that kind of thing
usually will lead you
down a bad path.
Um, and finding supportive
people who can just say,
"You know,
I experienced that too,"
or "Here's what helped me,"
or "Here's a science-based
resource that I found helpful."
is going to be helpful.
Just finding that is what's
difficult on the internet
because it's just, again,
this firehose of just nonsense.
And especially when you are
sick and suffering,
or maybe socially isolated,
or dealing with whatever
mental health issues
can come out of having
an untreated condition,
that can be, you know,
you're not necessarily
in the best place to do research
at that time.
So that's also
quite difficult.
So, you know, it's a problem
I think we need to solve
from multiple different angles.
And it's really
a societal problem.
And I hope people
get an opportunity
to check out your book
when it comes.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
And thank you so much
for making time for us,
it's been a pleasure.
Yeah, my pleasure, too.
