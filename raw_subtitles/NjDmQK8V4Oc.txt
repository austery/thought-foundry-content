Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
In the past two weeks
We made two videos about mother-daughter relationships.
Many friends resonated with this.
So, this video...
I'd like to talk about my mother's emotional issues.
Also because recently
A female friend told me her story
After obtaining her consent
I turned her confusion and experiences into this video.
Her experience is also very representative.
This woman's marriage is very typical.
It's a combination of a responsible woman and a mama's boy.
Her husband has not psychologically weaned himself off.
Faced with her mother-in-law's unreasonable demands
Her husband always advised her to be more patient.
He would occasionally bring up his mother to complain.
It implies that the mother is the most pitiful one.
After marriage
The husband's heart seems to remain with his mother.
increasingly withdrawn from social and family responsibilities
And this woman
She bore the main financial burden and household chores for the family.
One day
When the husband tried to lecture his 4-year-old son
Because there was a lack of emotional communication between father and son.
His son ignored him.
This father who felt his self-esteem was threatened
My first reaction wasn't to reflect on myself.
Instead, he blamed his wife.
He said it was his wife who instigated him.
In that instant
This lady
years of accumulated grievances and anger
It erupted
She and her husband had a heated argument in front of the children.
But compared to the argument itself
What tormented her even more was the reaction afterward.
She was consumed by deep regret and self-blame.
When she told her friends about it
She received no comfort.
Instead, criticism
Friends said, "You shouldn't argue in front of the children."
Even if the conflict between the mother and father is very deep
"A father should also maintain a good image in front of his children."
"You'll leave your child with psychological trauma."
These words made her feel even more guilty.
So, this video...
Let's talk about
How to view conflict in intimate relationships
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"

Do you have any topics you'd like to discuss or consult with me about?
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
First, we must acknowledge that
Mother's parenting style
It does indeed affect children's mental health
It plays an extremely important role
This is also what we've seen in many of our previous videos.
Repeatedly emphasized
Mother
Often, it is the first mirror a child sees of the world.
The child sees himself through his mother's eyes
Through the mother's comfort
Learned to recognize one's own emotions
Establish the most basic initiative
And trust and love for oneself
If this mirror breaks
Or unable to respond to the child
A child's sense of self can indeed be shaken.
This is not just theory
This is also a personal experience for many of us.
However, I want to emphasize that
All of this should not become a shackle for mothers.
In our current popular psychology
There is a bad tendency
That is to focus solely on the mother.
Using a microscope to find the mother's mistakes
Demanding perfection from mothers
this
This can easily create a misconception of unfairness among the public.
It seems like all the mistakes in parenting
It was all my mother's fault.
But in many cases
Especially in families where the husband is absent
Mother
They often have to shoulder too much responsibility for raising children.
An obvious truth is
People who do more are more likely to make mistakes.
And those who do nothing will never make a mistake.
When we focus solely on the mother's faults
This can easily encourage fathers to shirk their responsibilities.
However
In many families
We can easily spot "anxious, bad mothers".
With the "fake enlightened father"
Such a combination
The mother appeared very anxious.
Nagging, worrying about every little thing.
The father, on the other hand, seemed quite carefree and free-spirited.
Even her educational philosophy sounds more progressive and enlightened than her mother's.
That is, not putting pressure on children.
for example
Some mothers are very anxious about their children's grades.
The father, however, seemed indifferent.
As long as the child is happy.
The child believes that his father's educational philosophy is more advanced.
We can certainly agree.
The child from the father
I felt a sense of ease and pleasure.
However
My father's open-mindedness was often feigned.
True enlightenment is not about doing nothing.
Instead, it is based on
Based on insight and understanding of the child's inner world
It requires a tremendous amount of effort to empathize.
And some fathers' carefree attitude
Essentially, it's because he doesn't care.
He distanced himself from the matter.
Treat children like pets
When you're happy, tease them.
If you're unhappy, just avoid it.
Because there was no genuine emotional investment.
Therefore, there is no burden.
Because there is no burden
So he appears emotionally stable.
However
Once you encounter a real setback
or
Once you start dealing with those tedious and complex details
Fathers may be less patient than mothers.
Speaking of which
Some friends might say
Even if the father is responsible
But the mother expressed negative emotions.
It can also cause trauma to children.
That's obvious, isn't it?
However I think
A child with a healthy mind
It shouldn't be necessary.
Based on
The mother sacrificed her own mental health
Chinese Society
It has a deep cultural tradition of praising the suffering of mothers.
In traditional narratives
The image of the perfect mother is often bittersweet.
She always endured hardship.
Rough hands
Clean the house spotless
Save the best meat for the children.
I have never enjoyed
And never complained
certainly
This is primarily a form of physical and material suffering.
Many people have realized
This is actually a heavy form of moral coercion.
However
With the development of the times
This kind of kidnapping may not disappear.
Instead, new variants have emerged.
For example, popular psychology
It seems a new kind of "mother worship" is being created.
We can call it emotional "perfectionism".
For the sake of children's mental health
Mothers not only have to take care of daily life
They must also maintain a high degree of emotional stability.
You can't be angry
Cannot be uneasy
Don't be anxious
You can't even cry in front of your children.
It seemed that as soon as the mother showed even a hint of negative emotion...
The child's life seemed to be ruined.
This resulted in indelible psychological trauma.
I think this is not just about thinking of children as overly fragile.
There is no logic to it on a factual level.
For example, a mother
She was targeted at work
The husband does nothing.
As a result, she often felt like she was going to collapse.
But in order to be a so-called good mother
She dared not cry at home.
She sits in her car for half an hour every day after get off work.
Adjust facial expressions
Or perhaps she'd hide in the bathroom at night and silently shed tears.
In front of children
She was always a smiling, emotionally stable person.
However, the child became inexplicably anxious.
Because children can smell the oppressive gunpowder smell in the air.
But what she saw was her mother's somewhat mechanical smile.
This cognitive dissonance
Children are more uneasy than their actual emotions.
I also know a girl
She was once hired to babysit a mother.
This mother spends several hours every day
Studying various parenting philosophies
And gave this girl extremely strict instructions.
It could even be described as a strange instruction.
for example
Demand this girl
You must say a blessing to your child every day.
You must keep a smile on your face when facing a baby.
Every move of the baby
You must maintain 100% concentration.
You can't be distracted for even a second.
The girl remarked to me, "Anthony..."
I think
This employer really loves her child so much.
But I don't think so.
I said: I don't think this is love.
In my opinion
This is just extreme control.
And a dogmatic, mechanical, and poor understanding of psychology.
She ordered you and demanded this of you
You must be feeling very nervous and unhappy.
As a result, the child will perceive this.
Infants perceive the world
It's not about what blessings are said.
It's not about what's on the other person's face.
A fake smile like a mask
Instead, focus on sensing muscle tension and breathing frequency.
The true aura revealed in his eyes
If the mother is not allowed to express her pain
Mother will get sick
And a sick and depressed mother
It is difficult to raise psychologically healthy children.
We need to realize
"A real mother is more powerful than a perfect mother."
For example, in our case
If this woman continues to swallow her anger
She was sending a silent signal to the child.
When your boundaries are violated
You can only swallow your grievances.
Facing injustice
Maintaining surface peace and harmony
More important than maintaining one's own dignity
But this is the real psychological trauma.
because
She teaches children to develop a false self.
To cater to others
Speaking of which
Some friends may ask
If we support mothers expressing anger to their children
Won't the child feel unsafe?
I think
Many people consider emotional harmony
Understand it as maintaining a joyful resonance at all times.
But the real tuning
It is a response to the current realities of relationships.
if
The room was clearly filled with an atmosphere of tension and conflict.
But the mother was forcing a smile.
This misalignment can make children feel uneasy.
I may doubt whether my feelings are real.
so
The harmony contained a portion of anger.
That is healthy harmony
When the mother expresses anger
She is telling the child: Your current behavior
Or is it my dad's current behavior that hurts me?
I have strong feelings about this.
so
The child has confirmed that their actions have an impact.
This also confirms that the mother is a person of flesh and blood.
In fact
In his essay "Hate and Countertransference," Winnicott...
This points out the various kinds of hatred mothers have for their children.
And the legitimacy of these hatreds themselves.
For example, a baby might attack its mother.
They will treat their mothers as tools and slaves.
It will scream and cry endlessly.
then
Mothers inevitably experience anger.
Exhaustion
Dealing with these emotions is itself very necessary.
if
We completely avoided and suppressed these emotions.
These are considered immoral and unpleasant.
Forcing myself to only show pure love
Then this kind of love becomes a false form of sentimentality.
Winnicott called it sentimentality
It is a kind of love full of sadness.
Because sadness is precisely the denial and concealment of hatred.
Winnicott gave an example
He once adopted a 9-year-old boy.
The boy goes into a state of madness from time to time.
Winnicott initially provided him with a supportive environment.
But the boy still had a habit of causing destruction.
Winnicott
The boy was not directly insulted or punished.
When the boy had an episode
He kicked the boy out of the house.
Without any humiliation
Instead, clearly tell the boy
What did you do that I really dislike?
At the same time, Winnicott allowed him to calm down afterward.
Ring the doorbell and come back
Accept him as always
Instead of investigating the boy's past.
This helped the boy form his belief.
That is, although there will be conflicts in the relationship
But it can also be repaired.
certainly
This is an extreme case.
Winnicott's adopted
A child who has suffered severe trauma
But the core logic behind this case
However, it has universality.
In other words
If our expression is interpretive
non-aggressive
So
This kind of anger will not cause trauma to the child.
instead
It will become a catalyst for the development of children's mentalization abilities.
When a mother is able to express anger within boundaries
She was actually giving a very high-level demonstration.
You could say something like, "I'm very angry right now."
Because you just threw toys around.
It hit someone
This hurts, I need you to stop.
I also need some time to calm down.
This expression has three key characteristics
First of all, it is predictable.
trauma
Often stemming from unpredictable outbreaks of chaos
But if the child knows
As long as I did the act of hitting someone
Mom will get angry
As long as I stop
Mom will recover
This causal relationship is clear.
The world is safe
Children learn rules and boundaries
Second, it targets behavior.
Non-personal
You are attacking the action of throwing toys around.
Instead of the identity of "you are a bad kid"
Your anger has limits.
Without generalizing and spreading to the child as a whole
This protects the child's core self-esteem.
Let him know that he is still loved.
His behavior just needs to be corrected.
third
And the most important point is
It includes post-event explanations and repairs.
When the tide of anger recedes
When the mother explained what had just happened to the child
She was actually helping the child with attribution.
She would tell the child: "Mom spoke loudly just now."
It was because I was too anxious at the time.
I hope you can remember this rule
It is important to note that
What we mentioned above
These angers share a common foundation.
That is, they are all based on real-world situations.
As the book "Attachment in Psychotherapy" states...
As a parent or therapist
We don't need
It is impossible to always achieve perfect tuning.
Related studies
Even the best mother
On average, they will do something wrong to the baby every 19 seconds.
A breakup is not a failure of a relationship.
Rather, it is an unavoidable characteristic of relationships.
Compared to trying to avoid breaking
More importantly
We must be able to tolerate and repair these cracks.
In fact, it is precisely a process of tuning - mishap - retuning
This complete cycle
Build children's psychological resilience
Reconciliation after every argument
Clarification after each misunderstanding
They are all conveying a belief to the child's subconscious.
Even if there is pain in the relationship
But this suffering can be relieved.
Even if there is a storm
But eventually the storm will pass and the sun will shine again.
Therefore parents
There's no need to be an emotional perfectionist.
As long as we have the ability to reflect on ourselves
Able to after conflict
Use explanatory language to repair that crack.
Then the child will not only avoid trauma
On the contrary, the confirmation of having lost and then regained it will be more beneficial.
Become more secure
And those real traumas
It's often not because of the parents' legitimate anger.
Or occasional loss of control
Rather, it stems from the hatred projected by the parents.
This hatred wasn't because the child had done anything wrong.
Rather, it's the parents' own internal working patterns.
There was a problem
because
The parents themselves have long-standing unresolved trauma.
This leads to a split in their psychological functioning.
They have long been unable to perceive and see the child's inner world.
Instead, it's through the filter of trauma.
It triggered my past pain.
In this state
Parents lack mentalization skills.
They lost the mirror for reflection.
and the ability to perceive
Their neglect, harsh criticism, and even aggression towards children
It's not just a momentary emotional outburst.
Rather, it is a continuous, diffuse state.
Even afterward, they couldn't apologize.
Because they believed it was the child's fault.
This long-term, lack of reflection
Uncorrectable misalignment
This would exceed the limits of a child's psychological resilience.
This is what we need to be wary of.
In reality, they might lose control of their emotions.
Parents who feel guilty and reflect
This precisely demonstrates that they did a very good job.
Because only parents with strong self-reflection abilities
Only then can one constantly examine one's own behavior.
I worry about whether I have hurt the child.
And those who are truly trapped in pathological trauma
A person who turns a blind eye to the suffering of others
Often do not feel guilty
