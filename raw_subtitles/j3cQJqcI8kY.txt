>> Sometimes you just want to
hang out with some old TV
friends.
They'll be there for you
like they've been there before,
but they can also make you
yearn.
Nostalgia isn't only
pleasurable.
So why do we watch
the old favourites for the
comfort, for the longing or
both?
I got insights from
psychologists and cognitive
scientists.
>> George E Newman, an
associate professor of
management and marketing at the
University of Toronto's Rotman
School of Management.
George, great to have you.
How are you doing?
>> Great, great.
Thanks so much for having me.
>> Of course, I want you to
first start off with connecting
the dots for us.
Nostalgia over here,
escapism here.
How are they connected?
>> Yeah.
So in our work, what we find
is that nostalgia provides
this kind of escapism,
especially when times are
feeling uncertain.
So if it feels like the world
is a bit shaky, people are
more likely to cling to
nostalgia.
>> Tell us a little bit about
the context of the study and
what you wanted to look at.
>> Sure.
So in our experiment,
what we did is we brought
people into a laboratory on
campus.
And then we had they
came in and there's a vinyl
record player and it's Simon
Garfunkel record.
And we said,
okay, we want you to listen to
this record and tell us how
much you enjoy it, how good the
experience is.
But we had two different
versions of the study,
and in one study before they
listened to the record, they
read about how well things seem
maybe uncertain right now, but
if you look at a lot of
statistics, it actually it's
not so bad.
And then in the
other condition they read, well,
things seem bad now and they
really are.
They're very uncertain.
And what we found is
that in the situations in which
people had read about how the
current times were uncertain or
unstable, they actually liked
the experience of listening to
the record more.
>> In terms of the things that
we look for vinyl records, old
TV shows, which nowadays you
can just pop on, you know, any
streaming service and be like,
oh, the good old times.
What are we looking for
specifically when we are
looking into the past?
>> Yeah.
So it's really fascinating
because a lot of that
connection seems to be about
like a communal sense of
nostalgia, maybe not something
that was necessarily part of
your own childhood, but things
that we associate with the
broader culture.
And that's really what
becomes attractive to us,
especially in these times
of uncertainty.
>> Well, you mean communal.
What are we talking about?
Give us an example.
>> So communal, you know, it
could be things like
typewriters or vinyl records.
And interestingly, we find that,
you know, older products, let's
say, from the past, like
answering machines, even though
they were part of the past,
they don't have that same kind
of sense of nostalgia.
>> Is it fair to say that for
people who are looking at
something that's nostalgic,
have they necessarily lived
through it themselves, or is
this something that they have
that they kind of sort of
resonate and connect with and
be like, oh, I think that is
something that happened in the
past, or is it a direct
connection to something like a
typewriter or anything else?
>> It's a great question, and
we were really surprised by
this.
But in our work, we actually
found that it's about things
that maybe weren't part of
your own childhood.
So like vinyl records,
the number one selling
vinyl record is Taylor Swift.
>> Okay.
>> You know, so it's suggesting
that it's younger consumers,
younger music listeners who
probably never experienced a
vinyl record, certainly as part
of their own childhood.
But there's something about
that connection and attachment
that makes it really attractive.
>> We hear the word retro a lot
and people are like, oh, that's
so retro.
That's so in things have made
their way back.
How does nostalgia drive
cultural trends?
You mentioned consumerism.
How does that help what
people view, what people
buy at the end of the day?
>> Yeah.
So what we find in these times
of uncertainty and people
are kind of looking back
to the past.
It's it's not just about
products.
It's kind of images,
associations, ways of life that
we think about in the past.
So, you know, ultimately
it's about trying to connect to
a different time period,
maybe one that we think about
as being more stable.
>> I'm going to get personal
with you.
Is there something for you
that you kind of look back at
and go like, okay, in times of,
you know, uncertainty that you
lean into the nostalgia
of totally.
>> Well, you know, when we were
doing this research, part of
the studies that we were doing
is we were having undergraduate
students listen to vinyl
records in the lab, and I used
to have a vinyl record
collection as a kid, and it got
me interested in it again,
and then realised that vinyl
records are very expensive.
Yeah, yeah.
But but you know,
so I've done a little bit of
collecting.
I also really like
old photographs.
There's something about having
the, the tangible photo.
>> So not black and white.
We're talking coloured but
still.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
>> I think there's something
that's really nice about having
that, that physical photo that
for me personally kind of
serves the same function.
>> There is this idea or
perception that the past was
simpler, more authentic.
Is this a factor in sort of
our reach for for the past?
In some ways?
Is it true?
I think is what most people
kind of we have this perception
that those times are were
simpler, but are they
actually true?
>> It's really interesting.
So the research there suggests
that there's a bit of rose
coloured glasses.
When we think about the past
that we tend to filter out
all of the negatives,
all the difficulty, you know,
life expectancies were shorter,
it was harder to get medical
care, all of those kinds of
things that we don't maybe
normally think of.
We think about the past
as this simpler, happy time.
And so we might kind of
gloss over some of
those negative details.
>> Is it fair to say, though,
simpler times were also
probably in some cases younger
didn't have a lot of
responsibility.
So we can look back at those
days and kind of go like,
well, of course they
were simpler.
You know, we didn't have to
pay bills or a mortgage or,
you know, run errands.
>> Yeah.
You know, and there's
kind of like the blurring
between a communal sense of
nostalgia and our own personal
nostalgia.
And I think you're exactly
right that when we're
thinking about the past, we can
kind of mix those two things up
and say, it was a lot simpler
for me.
I just had to run around
and play outside, and it
must have been a nice time.
>> What I find fascinating is
people say they want to witness
authenticity as well, but then
we have this sort of urge to
watch shows like reality TV.
And I am curious, you know, why
do we binge reality TV shows
that seem to sort of defy that
desire of authenticity?
>> I think that's really
fascinating, too.
I mean, there's authenticity
in a different sense, right?
That that it's kind of
a window into people's
private lives.
Maybe the things that they
would be a little bit ashamed
of showing it.
So that's part of the
excitement, I think, of reality
TV is seeing that behind the
scenes look.
So it's a different sense of
authenticity.
It's maybe not authenticity
with respect to our culture,
but authenticity more having to
do with, you know, certain
kinds of people or a certain
kind of lifestyle.
>> So you have a book out
called How Great Ideas Happen,
and that looks at sort of the
past and how it can drive
innovative ideas.
Tell me, how can taking
a look back through
the history books do that?
>> So how great ideas happen is
definitely a big part of it is
looking towards the past and
being able to draw on past
ideas to fuel new ones.
So you know, a hometown
success story, the Instant Pot,
you know, looking back to
crock pots, which had been
around for a very long time,
but, you know, taking it
and reconfiguring it
and making something new or
Hamilton, you know, which just
kind of smashed Broadway
records.
But that was really about
focusing on a piece of history
that maybe had been overlooked,
or at least not talked about
quite as much, and bringing that
to the fore and putting
a very unique individual
spin on it.
>> Is there a great idea that
is waiting to be discovered
that you think is just on the
cusp of us kind of looking in
the past?
>> I mean, throughout the book,
I really try to bring up this
idea that that creativity and
innovation is something that's
available to all of us and that
there are great ideas
underneath our feet.
It's really just about paying
attention, being responsive,
looking to your environment
and in this case, also looking
to the past.
>> What would you recommend?
What is your go to in times of
uncertainty?
And you want to sort of to back
into a time of nostalgia.
What do you do?
>> Well, for me.
>> As a as a child of the 1980s,
it's all about those 1980s
movies like the John Hughes
movies is a real sense of
nostalgia for me personally.
Yeah.
>> All right, George, we're
going to leave it there.
Thank you so much. >> Thank you.
