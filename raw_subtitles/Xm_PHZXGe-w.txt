With
 your
 diet
 during
 pregnancy,
 you're


programming
 your
 baby's
 DNA.
 And
 this
 is


going
 to
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 your
 baby's


development
 and
 on
 their
 future
 risk
 of


disease.
 And
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 pregnant


moms
 who
 are
 eating
 a
 diet
 that's
 not


giving
 them
 the
 nutrients
 their
 baby


needs.
 This
 is
 not
 the
 mom's
 fault.
 This


is
 the
 fault
 of
 our
 food
 system.
 This
 is


the
 fault
 of
 society.
 And
 nobody's


telling
 moms
 about
 this.
 And
 I
 wanted
 to


create
 this
 guide
 to
 help
 parents


navigate
 that
 food
 system
 and
 see
 easy


things
 they
 can
 do
 to
 help
 their
 baby's


development.
 And
 I
 know
 this
 because
 as


a
 biochemist
 when
 I
 became
 pregnant,
 I


just
 went
 deep,
 deep,
 deep
 into
 the


research.
 And
 there
 are
 some
 main
 things


that
 I
 learned.
 For
 example,
 90%
 of
 moms


are
 not
 getting
 enough
 choline
 during


pregnancy.
 And
 choline
 is
 super


important.
 It
 forms
 your
 baby's
 brain
 in


the
 womb.
 So
 this
 is
 the
 amount
 of
 eggs


that
 I
 ate
 per
 week
 during
 the
 9
 months


of
 pregnancy
 because
 this
 is
 the


simplest
 way
 to
 give
 enough
 choline
 to


our
 baby.
 And
 then
 your
 baby
 needs
 no


fructose
 during
 pregnancy.
 So
 sugar
 from


dessert,
 from
 chocolate,
 from
 muffins,


from
 cupcakes,
 your
 baby
 needs
 none
 of


this.
 Because
 if
 you
 have
 very
 high


glucose
 levels
 during
 pregnancy,


scientists
 have
 found
 that
 your
 baby's


DNA
 will
 have
 epigenetic
 switches
 that


are
 programming
 them
 towards
 having
 a


higher
 vulnerability
 to
 develop


diabetes,
 obesity,
 and
 psychiatric


disorders.
 Next,
 this
 is
 basically
 the


amount
 of
 protein
 that
 I
 needed
 to
 eat


every
 single
 day
 in
 the
 third
 trimester


of
 pregnancy.


>> Yeah.
 because
 the
 studies
 show
 low


protein
 diets
 lead
 to
 smaller
 babies
 and


potentially
 this
 epigenetic
 programming


of
 staying
 smaller
 throughout
 life.
 And


it's
 findings
 like
 that
 that
 led
 me
 to


create
 a
 plan
 and
 simple
 hacks
 for


pregnant
 moms
 and
 we
 can
 talk
 about


them.


>> And
 then
 what
 does
 the
 research
 say


about
 breastfeeding,
 exercise,
 caffeine,


and
 also
 do
 you
 recommend
 that
 mothers


take
 certain
 supplements?


>> So
 this
 is
 what
 people
 need
 to
 know.


>> Guys,
 I've
 got
 a
 quick
 favor
 to
 ask
 you.


We're
 approaching
 a
 significant


subscriber
 milestone
 on
 this
 show
 and


roughly
 69%
 of
 you
 that
 listen
 and
 love


this
 show
 haven't
 yet
 subscribed
 for


whatever
 reason.
 If
 there
 was
 ever
 a


time
 for
 you
 to
 do
 us
 a
 favor,
 if
 we've


ever
 done
 anything
 for
 you,
 given
 you


value
 in
 any
 way,
 it
 is
 simply
 hitting


that
 subscribe
 button.
 And
 it
 means
 so


much
 to
 myself,
 but
 also
 to
 my
 team
 cuz


when
 we
 hit
 these
 milestones,
 we
 go
 away


as
 a
 team
 and
 celebrate.
 And
 it's
 the


thing,
 the
 simple,
 free,
 easy
 thing
 you


can
 do
 to
 help
 make
 this
 show
 a
 little


bit
 better
 every
 single
 week.
 So
 that's


a
 favor
 I
 would
 ask
 you.
 And
 um
 if
 you


do
 hit
 the
 subscribe
 button,
 I
 won't
 let


you
 down.
 And
 we'll
 continue
 to
 find


small
 ways
 to
 make
 this
 whole
 production


better.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 being
 part


of
 this
 journey.
 Means
 the
 world.
 And
 uh


yeah,
 let's
 do
 this.


Jesse
 Inospay,
 the
 glucose
 goddess,


for
 people
 that
 don't
 know
 who
 you
 are,


what
 have
 you
 spent
 the
 best
 part
 of
 the


last
 decade
 committing
 your
 life
 to
 and


why?


My
 work
 started
 in
 the
 glucose
 space,


meaning
 the
 blood
 sugar
 space.
 I
 was


showing
 people
 how
 blood
 sugar
 impacts


all
 of
 us
 on
 a
 daily
 basis.
 The
 spikes


and
 dips
 after
 we
 eat,
 they
 lead
 to


inflammation,
 faster
 aging,
 cravings,


fatigue,
 and
 it's
 been
 the
 basis
 of
 my


work
 because
 glucose
 matters
 for


everybody
 and
 it
 is
 the
 core
 of
 a


healthy
 body
 and
 mind.
 And
 so
 that's


where
 I
 started
 because
 it's
 so


important.


>> We
 last
 spoke
 almost
 two
 years
 ago
 now.


What
 have
 you
 learned
 in
 those
 last
 two


years
 that
 has
 evolved
 your
 own
 thinking


or
 has
 developed
 your
 own
 thinking
 in


any
 way?
 If
 we
 reflect
 on
 the
 last


conversations
 we
 had
 around
 glucose


spikes
 and
 sugar
 and
 the
 health


consequences
 and
 diets,
 is
 there


anything
 you've
 learned
 in
 those
 two


years
 that
 is
 interesting
 and
 new?


>> Oh,
 absolutely.
 I
 think
 mostly
 the


impact
 of
 glucose
 on
 mood
 and
 on


relationships.
 For
 example,
 there's
 this


fascinating
 study
 that
 took
 married


couples
 and
 they
 gave
 the
 husband
 and


the
 wives
 a
 little
 voodoo
 doll


representing
 their
 spouse.
 And
 the


researchers
 told
 uh
 the
 participants
 to


put
 a
 little
 pin
 in
 the
 voodoo
 doll


every
 time
 their
 spouse
 annoyed
 them.
 At


the
 end
 of
 the
 two
 weeks,
 the


researchers
 counted
 the
 number
 of
 pins


in
 the
 voodoo
 dolls
 and
 they
 also


measured
 the
 participants
 glucose


levels.
 They
 found
 that
 the
 people
 who


had
 the
 most
 glucose
 lows
 had
 put
 the


most
 pins
 in
 the
 voodoo
 doll


representing
 their
 spouse.


>> Wow.


>> So,
 it's
 just
 an
 association,
 but
 it's


interesting.
 And
 scientists
 then
 found


that
 when
 you
 have
 very
 unsteady
 glucose


levels,
 it
 impacts
 this
 neurotransmitter


in
 your
 brain
 called
 tyrrosine
 that


manages
 your
 mood.
 So,
 it
 seems
 that


with
 unsteady
 glucose
 levels,
 your
 mood


is
 less
 stable,
 which
 could
 then


correlate
 to
 you
 being
 more
 annoyed
 at


your
 spouse.
 So,
 I
 think
 studies
 like


this
 have
 really
 blown
 my
 mind.


>> What's
 going
 on
 when
 we
 go
 through
 a


glucose
 crash,
 per
 se?


>> So,
 glucose
 is
 your
 body's
 energy.
 So,


your
 brain
 is
 constantly
 monitoring
 how


much
 glucose
 do
 we
 have
 in
 our


bloodstream.
 And
 steady
 glucose
 is


great.
 When
 your
 glucose
 levels
 crash,


this
 indicates
 biologically
 that
 you're


out
 of
 fuel.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 powerful


signal
 to
 your
 body
 and
 your
 brain
 to


say,
 "Alert,
 alert.
 We
 need
 food.
 We


need
 more
 glucose."
 And
 so
 it
 creates


all
 these
 downstream
 consequences
 on


your
 mood.
 You
 become
 hangry.
 All
 you


think
 about
 is
 food.
 You're
 in
 a
 bad


mood.
 You're
 like,
 "I
 need
 to
 eat


something."
 You
 look
 for
 a
 banana.
 You


look
 for
 a
 cookie.
 It
 can
 also
 activate


the
 craving
 center
 in
 your
 brain
 that


says,
 "Steven,
 go
 find
 some
 chocolate."


And
 science
 has
 shown
 this.
 Low
 glucose


levels
 creates
 a
 cascade
 of
 consequences


on
 how
 we
 feel
 and
 what
 we
 seek.
 Now,


what's
 interesting
 is
 that
 back
 in
 the


day
 when
 we
 had
 low
 glucose
 levels,
 I'm


talking
 like
 hunter
 gatherer
 times,
 they


wouldn't
 arrive
 so
 quickly
 because
 we


didn't
 have
 these
 big
 spikes
 that
 then


led
 to
 these
 big
 drastic
 drops.
 It
 was


more
 we
 ate
 in
 a
 more
 balanced
 way
 with


less
 sugar
 obviously.
 So,
 when
 our


glucose
 became
 low,
 it
 was
 a
 bit
 more


gradual.
 Today,
 because
 we
 have
 access


to
 all
 this
 sugar,
 we
 can
 spike
 our


glucose
 very
 quickly
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 it


then
 crashes
 very
 quickly.
 So,
 the


effects
 are
 pretty
 much
 immediate
 and


they're
 very
 intense.
 All
 of
 a
 sudden,


you
 go
 from
 feeling
 okay
 to
 your
 brain


being
 in
 alert
 mode.
 We
 need
 to
 find


more
 fuel.
 So,
 we've
 disregulated
 our


glucose
 levels
 to
 the
 point
 where
 it's


impacting
 us
 in
 a
 very
 unnatural
 way.


>> Is
 that
 in
 part
 because
 we
 modify
 our


food?
 Even
 fruit.
 When
 I
 looked
 back


through
 the
 history
 of
 fruit,
 apples,


bananas,
 etc.
 looked
 extremely
 different


before
 they
 were
 modified
 to
 be
 juicier


and
 sweeter,
 etc.


>> Completely.
 It's
 like
 dogs.
 So
 all
 the


the
 dog
 breeds
 today
 from
 Chihuahua
 to


golden
 retrievers,
 they
 all
 come
 from


wolves.
 Humans
 have
 been
 breeding
 wolves


together
 to
 create
 these
 different


species
 of
 dogs.
 They
 all
 have
 that


ancestor
 of
 the
 grey
 wolf.
 So
 humans
 are


very
 good
 at
 breeding
 natural
 things
 to


serve
 their
 purposes.
 And
 when
 it
 comes


to
 fruit,
 it's
 the
 same
 thing.
 So
 as
 you


say,
 if
 you
 compare
 like
 an
 ancestral


banana
 or
 an
 ancestral
 apple
 to
 a
 modern


one,
 they
 look
 completely
 different.
 And


you
 should
 pull
 up
 these
 photos.
 They're


fascinating.
 Ancestral
 banana,
 tiny,


full
 of
 fiber,
 full
 of
 seeds,
 not
 very


sweet.
 And
 then
 modern
 banana,
 full
 of


sugar,
 low
 in
 fiber,
 really
 easy
 to
 eat.


So
 that's
 the
 first
 thing
 people
 need
 to


know
 about
 fruit.
 Fruit
 is
 not
 natural.


Fruit
 is
 the
 product
 of
 human


engineering.
 However,
 a
 piece
 of
 whole


fruit
 also
 contains
 fiber
 and
 water.
 So


even
 though
 it's
 been
 bred
 to
 have
 a
 lot


of
 sugar,
 the
 fiber
 in
 the
 water
 reduce


how
 quickly
 the
 sugar
 arrives
 in
 our


bloodstream,
 making
 it
 more
 or
 less
 okay


for
 us.
 But
 the
 problem
 comes
 when
 we


denature
 that
 piece
 of
 fruit.
 Meaning
 if


we
 remove
 the
 fiber,
 for
 example,
 if
 we


take
 an
 orange
 and
 make
 an
 orange
 juice,


what
 are
 we
 actually
 talking
 about
 here?


Actually,
 oranges
 are
 not
 even
 a
 natural


fruit.
 They
 were
 invented
 thousands
 of


years
 ago
 by
 breeding
 by
 crossing
 other


species
 of
 fruit.
 To
 make
 an
 orange


juice,
 you
 throw
 away
 part
 of
 the


orange.
 You
 throw
 away
 the
 solid
 part,


which
 is
 the
 fiber.
 So,
 you're
 left
 with


the
 sugar
 of
 a
 very
 sugary
 fruit,
 water,


and
 no
 fiber.
 As
 a
 result,
 you're


getting
 a
 very
 unnatural
 amount
 of
 sugar


in
 your
 bloodstream
 with
 no
 fiber
 to


protect
 the
 spike.
 So,
 a
 big
 big
 glucose


spike.
 And
 people
 often
 say,
 "Oh,
 well,


you
 know,
 fruit
 has
 vitamins
 in
 it,
 so


therefore
 orange
 juice
 must
 be
 better


for
 you
 than
 Coca-Cola."
 That's
 actually


a
 total
 myth.
 If
 you
 compare
 a
 glass
 of


orange
 juice
 to
 a
 glass
 of
 Coca-Cola,


it's
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 sugar,
 about
 25


grams.
 and
 the
 sugar
 in
 the
 can
 of
 Coke


and
 the
 sugar
 in
 the
 glass
 of
 orange


juice,
 they're
 exactly
 the
 same.
 They're


glucose
 and
 fructose
 molecules,
 and
 your


body
 absorbs
 them
 in
 the
 exact
 same
 way.


Your
 body
 does
 not
 make
 a
 difference


between
 sugar
 from
 an
 orange
 and
 sugar


from
 a
 sugar
 beat
 that's
 now
 in
 a
 can
 of


Coca-Cola.
 I
 I
 hope
 that
 orange
 juice


disappears
 from
 school
 lunches,
 from


hospital
 meals.
 The
 World
 Health


Organization
 recommends
 25
 gram
 of
 sugar


per
 day
 or
 less.
 So,
 with
 just
 one
 glass


of
 orange
 juice
 in
 the
 morning
 that
 you


squeeze
 at
 home
 that
 you
 think
 is
 good


for
 you,
 you're
 already
 at
 the
 maximum


limit
 of
 sugar
 recommendation.
 And
 most


people
 drink
 this
 glass
 of
 orange
 juice


thinking
 it's
 good
 for
 them.
 Most
 people


with
 diabetes
 drink
 this
 glass
 of
 orange


juice
 thinking
 it's
 helping
 them
 with


their
 condition.
 And
 that's
 really
 where


I
 want
 to
 act.
 I
 want
 to
 help
 people


understand
 what
 they
 actually
 need
 to
 do


to
 feel
 better
 so
 they
 don't
 fall
 victim


to
 marketing.


>> We
 talked
 there
 about
 glucose
 crashes


and
 what
 that
 causes
 in
 terms
 of


behavior.
 I
 was
 wondering
 if
 also
 causes


other
 compulsive
 behaviors.
 Does
 it
 make


me
 more
 likely
 to
 want
 to
 doom
 scroll
 on


the
 internet
 if
 I
 have
 been
 eating
 lots


of
 sugar?


>> Well,
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 Why
 does


sugar
 feel
 good?
 Because
 it
 releases


dopamine
 in
 our
 brain.
 Dopamine
 is
 the


pleasure
 molecule.
 It
 makes
 us
 feel


good.
 So
 if
 I
 were
 to
 drink
 this
 glass


of
 orange
 juice,
 which
 you
 would
 have
 to


pay
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 for
 me
 to
 drink


this,
 but
 my
 brain
 would
 let
 out
 so
 many


dopamine
 molecules
 and
 I
 would
 feel
 this


wave
 of
 pleasure.
 Now
 the
 problem
 is


people
 confuse
 that
 with
 energy.
 It's


not
 energy,
 it's
 dopamine.
 And
 dopamine


is
 the
 same
 exact
 molecule
 that
 gets


released
 when
 you're
 scrolling
 on


Instagram.
 You
 look
 for
 the
 next
 post,


you
 look
 for
 the
 next
 video.
 Every
 time


you
 get
 something
 new
 and
 interesting,


bam,
 a
 dopamine
 signal
 as
 well
 in
 your


brain.
 So,
 if
 you're
 constantly


triggering
 dopamine
 in
 your
 brain,


you're
 going
 to
 constantly
 crash.
 You're


going
 to
 have
 dopamine
 spikes,
 dopamine


crashes,
 and
 become
 more
 and
 more


addicted
 to
 it.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 about


studies
 showing
 glucose
 spikes,
 and
 for


example,
 doom
 scrolling.
 But
 if
 you
 look


at
 just
 the
 biology
 of
 it,
 they're


triggering
 the
 same
 center
 in
 your


brain.
 So,
 for
 sure,
 I
 can
 imagine
 that


if
 you
 are
 on
 a
 dopamine
 binging
 or


dopamine
 addiction
 cycle,
 both
 an
 orange


juice
 and
 a
 glucose
 spike
 and
 doom


scrolling
 can
 go
 hand
 in
 hand.
 I
 was


just
 looking
 at
 some
 research
 here
 and


it
 says
 yes,
 you're
 significantly
 more


likely
 to
 doom
 scroll
 during
 a
 glucose


crash.
 And
 it
 explains
 that
 that's


because
 of
 something
 called
 the
 energy


crisis
 in
 the
 prefrontal
 cortex
 where


your
 prefrontal
 cortex,
 the
 part
 of
 the


brain
 responsible
 for
 willpower
 and


decision-m
 and
 saying
 no
 to
 things
 like


doom
 scrolling
 in
 the
 case
 where
 glucose


drops.
 This
 area
 is
 first
 to
 dim
 the


lights
 to
 save
 energy
 for
 vital


functions.
 The
 result
 is
 you
 lose
 your


executive
 function,
 making
 it
 nearly


impossible
 to
 resist
 the
 hit
 of
 dopamine


that
 social
 media
 provides.
 But
 it
 also


says
 the
 second
 reason
 is
 this
 dopamine


trap.
 And
 the
 third
 is
 generally
 your


emotional
 regulation
 goes
 out
 of
 the


window.
 I
 I
 think
 this
 in
 part
 because
 I


notice
 in
 myself
 that
 when
 I
 am
 on
 a


higher
 glucose
 diet,
 I'm
 more
 likely
 to


get
 involved
 in
 like
 compulsive


behaviors
 that
 I
 otherwise
 don't
 like.


>> Yeah.


>> Like
 doing
 scrolling
 on
 the
 internet.


>> You
 have
 less
 willpower,
 less
 control.


>> Yeah.
 I
 have
 less
 willower.


>> You
 feel
 more
 addicted.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 I
 have
 less
 control
 over
 my


life.


>> And
 the
 first
 thing
 that
 people
 notice


is
 that
 when
 they
 are
 on
 a
 glucose


roller
 coaster,
 they
 feel
 addicted
 to


sugar.
 like
 it's
 no
 longer
 a
 choice
 to


go
 after
 that
 cookie,
 it
 feels
 like
 a


compulsive
 behavior
 like
 I
 need
 sugar


right
 now
 because
 that
 glucose
 crash
 is


triggering
 a
 biological
 mechanism
 that


is
 nearly
 impossible
 to
 override.
 So


when
 you
 tell
 somebody
 just
 eat
 less


sugar,
 that's
 that's
 BS.
 You
 can't
 just


eat
 less
 sugar.
 You
 have
 to
 go
 fix
 the


underlying
 cause,
 which
 is
 usually
 the


glucose
 crash.
 You
 can't
 override
 that


feeling
 of
 craving
 that
 comes
 from
 deep


inside
 your
 brain
 when
 you
 have
 a


glucose
 crash.
 You
 need
 to
 fix
 the


spike,
 reduce
 the
 spike,
 and
 then


naturally
 the
 spike
 also
 reduces
 and
 you


feel
 fewer
 cravings.
 There's
 this
 theory


called
 the
 protein
 leverage
 hypothesis.


And
 this
 this
 theory
 says
 that
 your
 body


will
 keep
 you
 hungry
 and
 keep
 you


seeking
 food
 until
 you've
 given
 it


enough
 protein.
 So
 if
 in
 the
 morning
 you


have
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 some
 oats
 and
 toast


and
 jam,
 very
 little
 protein,
 your


body's
 going
 to
 be
 like,
 "Okay,
 we


didn't
 get
 any
 protein.
 We
 need
 to
 get


more
 protein."
 So
 you
 stay
 more
 and
 more


hungry.
 At
 10
 a.m.
 you're
 hungry
 again.


If
 you
 have
 a
 cookie,
 again,
 no
 protein.


Your
 body
 will
 keep
 you
 hungry.
 If
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 you
 have
 40
 grams
 of


protein,
 then
 that
 craving
 dissipates


and
 that
 feeling
 of
 seeking
 out
 food


sort
 of
 calms
 down
 because
 your
 body
 got


what
 he
 actually
 needed,
 which
 was


protein.


>> People
 send
 you
 lots
 of
 messages.
 You


have
 a
 enormous
 online
 following.
 If
 I


was
 to
 peer
 into
 those
 DMs
 you
 get,
 what


would
 be
 the
 essence
 of
 what
 people
 are


saying
 to
 you?


>> They're
 asking
 me
 about
 specific
 foods.


They're
 saying,
 "Are
 lentils
 okay?
 Can
 I


eat
 three
 eggs
 a
 day?
 what
 kind
 of


vinegar
 should
 I
 use?
 And
 often
 it's


people
 trying
 to
 navigate
 the
 marketing


messages
 they're
 seeing
 on
 the
 packaging


of
 things.
 They'll
 be
 like,
 "This
 can
 of


tea
 that
 says
 zero
 grams
 of
 sugar,
 is
 it


good
 for
 me?"
 They're
 trying
 to
 decode


what
 these
 food
 products
 actually


contain
 and
 whether
 they're
 actually


good
 for
 them.


>> And
 is
 there
 any
 real
 standout
 marketing


messages
 that
 are
 deceptive?


>> Yeah.


No
 added
 sugars.
 That
 is
 so
 deceptive


because
 this
 glass
 of
 orange
 juice
 has


no
 added
 sugars
 in
 it
 because
 the
 sugar


was
 there
 at
 the
 beginning.
 It
 came
 from


the
 orange
 from
 the
 original
 ingredient.


So
 on
 a
 can
 of
 orange
 juice,
 you
 can
 say


no
 added
 sugar
 even
 though
 it
 contains


25
 grams
 of
 sugar,
 which
 is
 the
 maximum


limit
 the
 recommends
 for
 your
 daily


sugar
 intake.
 So
 that's
 a
 really
 really


bad
 one.
 Another
 one
 would
 be
 something


that
 says
 gluten-free
 or
 vegan.
 It's
 not


because
 it's
 gluten-free
 veating
 vegan


that
 it's
 good
 for
 you,
 but
 we're
 being


tricked.
 You
 know,
 food
 manufacturers
 do


everything
 they
 can
 to
 make
 you
 buy


their
 products.
 I
 think
 I'm
 in
 the


season
 of
 life
 where
 I'm
 thinking
 a
 lot


about
 fertility,
 both
 my
 fertility,
 my


fiance's
 fertility,
 and
 how
 my
 diet,
 the


things
 I
 eat
 has
 an
 impact
 on
 that.
 What


what what
 what
 is
 it
 we
 need
 to
 know


about
 you,
 if
 we're
 trying
 to
 conceive,


if
 we
 want
 to
 have
 we
 want
 to
 have
 a


family,
 um
 is
 it
 really
 the
 case
 that
 I


need
 to
 start
 thinking
 about
 my
 own


fertility
 in
 the
 leadup
 to
 putting
 that


sperm
 into
 that
 egg?
 Yes,
 both
 the
 males


and
 the
 females
 need
 to
 be
 thinking


about
 fertility
 and
 nutrition
 plays
 a


big
 role
 and
 health
 plays
 a
 big
 role
 in


the
 quality
 of
 your
 sperm
 for
 example.


So
 a
 good
 idea
 would
 be
 to
 reduce
 before


you
 want
 to
 have
 a
 kid
 if
 you're
 the
 man


you
 know
 reduce
 alcohol,
 exercise
 more,


eat
 better
 so
 that
 your
 sperm
 are
 high


quality.
 So
 the
 sperm
 turnover
 is
 about


three
 months.
 So
 if
 you
 do
 like
 a


threemon
 sort
 of
 intense
 uh
 my
 sperm
 are


getting
 in
 shape
 kind
 of
 situation,
 it's


a
 good
 idea
 for
 women.
 It's
 different.


So,
 our
 eggs
 are
 present
 from
 before


we're
 born,
 but
 the
 quality
 of
 our
 diet,


of
 our
 nutrient
 reserves,
 is
 going
 to


impact
 our
 ability
 to
 have
 kids
 also.


And
 it's
 going
 to
 impact
 what
 our
 baby


gets
 in
 the
 first
 trimester
 of


pregnancy.


>> You've
 just
 given
 birth.


>> Eight
 months
 ago.
 Yeah.
 Feels
 like
 just


last
 week,
 but
 yeah,
 eight
 months
 ago.


>> And
 um
 I
 guess
 that's
 somewhat
 linked
 to


why
 you've
 written
 this
 new
 book,
 which


is
 titled
 Nine
 Months
 That
 Counts


Forever:
 How
 Your
 Pregnancy
 Diet
 Shapes


Your
 Baby's
 Future.
 You
 could
 have


written
 about
 anything,
 Jesse,
 and


people
 would
 have
 bought
 the
 book
 um


because
 people
 are
 so
 fascinated
 by
 you


and
 the
 work
 that
 you
 do.
 Why
 of
 all
 the


subjects
 you
 could
 have
 written
 about


was
 this
 the
 subject
 that
 meant
 the
 most


to
 you
 to
 commit
 a
 long
 period
 of
 your


life
 to?


>> Because
 it
 is
 a
 subject
 where
 there's


such
 a
 big
 gap,
 Stephen,
 between
 what


science
 knows
 and
 what
 parents
 are
 told.


It
 felt
 like
 there
 was
 a
 just
 canyon


between
 information
 in
 the
 studies


that's
 been
 there
 for
 decades
 and
 what
 I


as
 a
 pregnant
 woman
 went
 through
 and


what
 advice
 I
 was
 given,
 what's


available
 out
 there
 to
 pregnant
 moms.
 So


even
 though
 I
 was
 pregnant
 and
 I
 was


tired,
 I
 felt
 I
 need
 to
 write
 this
 book


because
 people
 need
 to
 know
 the
 power


that
 they
 have.
 So
 today,
 science
 knows


that
 you're
 not
 just
 an
 oven
 when
 you're


pregnant.
 Have
 you
 heard
 this
 thing


being
 a
 bun
 in
 the
 oven?
 It's
 an


American
 expression.
 Uh,
 I
 think
 I've


heard
 it
 once
 or
 twice.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 often
 if
 you're
 pregnant,


people
 will
 say,
 "Oh,
 you
 have
 a
 bun
 in


the
 oven.
 That's
 so
 cute."
 It's
 like
 an


expression.
 And
 I
 feel
 like
 this
 is


where
 all
 of
 our
 problems
 started


because
 it
 implies
 so
 many
 misleading


things.
 It
 implies
 that
 when
 you're


pregnant,
 you
 are
 an
 oven,
 meaning


you're
 just
 there
 to
 provide
 heat
 and


time.
 And
 people
 often
 say,
 "Just
 relax,


you
 know,
 let
 nature
 do
 its
 thing."
 So,


it
 implies
 that
 you're
 passive,
 that
 you


have
 no
 agency,
 no
 power.
 You're
 just
 a


vessel
 of
 heat
 and
 time.
 That's
 the


first
 problem.
 The
 second
 problem
 is


that
 it
 implies
 that
 just
 like
 a


chocolate
 cake
 that
 you
 put
 in
 the
 oven,


it
 implies
 that
 your
 baby,
 the
 moment


the
 sperm
 meets
 the
 egg,
 your
 baby
 is


set
 in
 stone.
 Like
 if
 you're
 making
 a


cake,
 when
 you
 make
 the
 brownie
 and
 you


put
 it
 in
 the
 oven,
 the
 oven
 is
 not


going
 to
 change
 the
 brownie
 into
 banana


bread.
 The
 oven
 is
 just
 cooking
 the


brownie.
 Well,
 actually,
 it's
 very


different
 with
 pregnancy.
 Your
 baby
 is


not
 set
 in
 stone
 at
 conception.
 What


happens
 during
 the
 nine
 months
 of


pregnancy
 is
 co-creating
 your
 baby's


plan.
 And
 depending
 on
 what
 you
 eat,
 a


different
 baby
 will
 come
 out.
 So,
 we've


been
 lying
 to
 pregnant
 moms,
 telling


them
 they
 have
 no
 agency,
 they
 have
 no


power,
 they
 should
 just
 relax
 and
 let


nature
 do
 its
 thing.
 So,
 that's
 why
 I


wrote
 this
 book
 because
 the
 science
 is


fascinating.


>> So,
 where
 where
 are
 pregnant
 women
 being


let
 down
 in
 this
 regard?
 Is
 it
 that


there's
 just
 not
 enough
 information
 out


there?
 Is
 there's
 there's
 not
 been


enough
 research
 out
 there?
 Is
 it
 bad


advice
 currently
 on
 the
 internet?


>> This
 is
 the
 fault
 of
 our
 food
 system.


This
 is
 the
 fault
 of
 society.
 This
 is


the
 fault
 of
 the
 food
 industry
 that
 we


were
 just
 talking
 about
 the
 marketing


messages.
 For
 everybody
 today
 in


developed
 countries,
 we
 are
 being
 fed


processed,
 unhealthy
 foods
 that
 are


hurting
 us.
 Whether
 we
 get
 diabetes
 or


heart
 disease,
 there's
 a
 link
 to
 food.


And
 today,
 even
 pregnant
 moms
 are
 being


let
 down
 by
 the
 food
 system
 and
 are


eating
 a
 diet
 without
 knowing
 it
 that's


not
 giving
 them
 the
 nutrients
 their
 baby


needs.
 So,
 the
 moment
 I
 became
 pregnant


the
 first
 time,
 I
 started
 researching.
 I


went
 to
 Google
 Scholar
 and
 I
 just
 opened


about
 a
 thousand
 tabs
 on
 my
 computer,


which
 is
 usually
 what
 I
 do
 when
 I'm


researching
 a
 new
 topic.
 And
 I
 looked
 at


the
 big
 review
 studies,
 the
 metaanalyses


of
 how
 nutrition
 during
 pregnancy


impacts
 our
 baby's
 development.
 I
 read


probably
 2,000
 scientific
 papers
 and
 I


just
 went
 deep,
 deep,
 deep
 into
 the


research.
 And
 out
 of
 it,
 I
 saw
 these


four
 big
 themes
 coming
 out
 of
 these
 four


nutrients
 that
 most
 moms
 are
 not
 getting


enough
 of
 in
 their
 diet
 or
 too
 much
 of


in
 their
 diet.
 And
 I
 wanted
 to
 create


this
 guide
 to
 help
 parents
 navigate
 that


food
 system
 and
 see
 easy
 things
 they
 can


do
 in
 the
 mom's
 diet
 to
 help
 their


baby's
 development.
 So
 while
 your
 baby's


DNA
 is
 set
 the
 moment
 the
 sperm
 meets


the
 egg
 with
 your
 diet
 during
 pregnancy,


you're
 programming
 that
 DNA.
 Have
 you


heard
 of
 epigenetics?


>> Yes.


>> Okay.
 So
 epigenetics
 are
 like
 these


little
 dimmer
 switches
 that
 sit
 on
 your


DNA
 and
 that
 say
 activate
 this
 gene
 or


silence
 this
 gene.
 And
 so
 during


pregnancy,
 you're
 putting
 these
 little


switches
 on
 your
 baby's
 DNA.
 And
 this
 is


going
 to
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 your
 baby's


development
 and
 on
 his
 future
 risk
 of


disease.
 I'll
 give
 you
 a
 very
 simple


example.
 If
 you
 have
 very
 high
 glucose


levels
 during
 pregnancy,
 scientists
 have


found
 that
 your
 baby's
 DNA
 will
 have


epigenetic
 switches
 that
 are
 programming


him
 towards
 having
 a
 higher


vulnerability
 to
 develop
 diabetes


himself
 in
 his
 lifetime.
 So
 if
 you
 have


high
 glucose
 levels,
 your
 baby
 will
 be


programmed
 to
 be
 more
 likely
 to
 then


have
 high
 glucose
 levels
 himself


throughout
 his
 life
 as
 a
 kid,
 a


teenager,
 and
 an
 adult.
 That's


epigenetic
 programming.
 And
 depending
 on


your
 diet
 as
 the
 mom,
 you
 can
 program


your
 kids
 differently.
 But
 nobody
 tells


moms
 about
 this.
 And
 that's
 what
 I'm


trying
 to
 change.


>> What
 do
 I
 need
 to
 know
 as
 someone
 that


knows
 very
 little
 about
 pregnancy
 to


really
 understand
 the
 like
 basics
 of


what's
 going
 on?


>> What
 time
 frame
 matters?
 What
 happens


when?
 So
 females
 have
 a
 uterus
 which
 is


an
 organ
 and
 the
 uterus
 is
 where
 the


baby
 develops
 and
 the
 uterus
 grows
 as


pregnancy
 progresses
 and
 then
 when
 you


give
 birth
 the
 baby
 comes
 out
 of
 the


uterus
 and
 the
 uterus
 stays
 in
 the
 mom.


So
 that's
 important


when
 conception
 happens.
 So
 you
 have
 the


sperm
 meets
 the
 egg
 that
 little
 packet


of
 cells
 will
 implant
 in
 one
 of
 the


walls
 of
 the
 uterus
 and
 start
 growing.


And
 pregnancy
 is
 divided
 into
 three


trimesters.
 It's
 about
 nine
 months.
 So


months
 1
 to
 3
 is
 the
 first
 trimester.
 4


5
 6
 is
 the
 second
 trimester.
 7
 8
 9
 is


the
 third
 trimester.
 And
 what
 we're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 today
 is
 about


nutrition
 and
 how
 your
 baby's
 getting


the
 building
 blocks
 that
 he
 needs
 to


develop
 in
 your
 womb
 as
 the
 female.


Because
 your
 baby
 needs
 to
 grow
 from
 a


single
 cell
 to
 40
 trillion
 cells
 by
 the


time
 he's
 born,
 right?
 He
 grows
 from


like
 nothing
 to
 three
 or
 four
 kilos.
 And


that
 has
 to
 come
 from
 somewhere.
 It


doesn't
 just
 come
 out
 of
 thin
 air.
 All


those
 building
 blocks,
 all
 that
 matter


is
 coming
 from
 you,
 from
 what
 you're


eating.
 What
 you
 eat
 becomes
 your
 baby.


So
 your
 baby
 is
 what
 you
 eat.


>> In
 the
 first
 trimester,
 your
 baby's


getting
 food
 from
 the
 sort
 of
 milk
 that


your
 uterus
 creates.
 So
 it's
 uterine


secretions.
 And
 then
 from
 the
 second


trimester
 onwards,
 something
 incredible


happens.
 And


>> when's
 the
 second
 trimester?
 That's


>> it
 starts
 at
 four
 months.


>> Okay.
 And
 so
 for
 the
 second
 and
 third


trimesters,
 there's
 another
 organ
 that


you
 create
 inside
 your
 uterus.
 It's


called
 the
 placenta.
 And
 the
 placenta's


job
 is
 to
 bring
 your
 baby's
 bloodstream


and
 your
 bloodstream
 as
 the
 mom
 in


really
 close
 contact.
 And
 all
 of
 a


sudden,
 symbiosis
 is
 established.
 And


your
 bloodstream
 and
 your
 baby's


bloodstream
 are
 then
 going
 to
 exchange


nutrients
 and
 waste.
 So
 your
 baby's


going
 to
 get
 all
 his
 nutrition
 directly


from
 your
 bloodstream.
 And
 Stephen,


here's
 a
 main
 myth
 that
 people
 believe.


They
 believe
 that
 your
 baby
 will
 just


get
 what
 he
 needs
 from
 you
 during


pregnancy.
 That's
 something
 moms
 are


told.
 Don't
 worry,
 your
 baby
 will
 get


what
 he
 needs
 from
 you.
 This
 is
 a
 lie.


Depending
 on
 what
 you
 eat,
 your
 baby


will
 have
 different
 access
 to
 important


nutrients.
 So,
 your
 baby
 doesn't
 get


what
 he
 needs.
 He
 gets
 what's
 there
 and


what
 you
 give
 him.
 So,
 let's
 take
 a


simple
 example.
 One
 of
 the
 nutrients


that
 is
 really
 important
 is
 called


choline.
 Have
 you
 heard
 about
 choline


before?
 Is
 that
 in
 eggs?


>> Yes,
 exactly.
 It's
 in
 the
 egg
 yolk.
 So,


choline
 is
 super
 important.
 It
 forms


your
 baby's
 brain
 in
 the
 womb.
 So,
 your


baby
 your
 baby's
 brain
 has
 these
 cells


that
 are
 forming
 called
 neurons,
 which


are
 the
 ones
 that
 process
 information.


And
 choline
 is
 important
 to
 creating


those
 neurons.
 And
 choline
 creates
 the


parts
 of
 your
 baby's
 brain
 that
 have
 to


do
 with
 memory,
 learning,
 and
 attention.


So
 that
 egg
 that
 you're
 holding
 contains


about
 125
 milligs
 of
 choline
 and
 it's
 an


incredible
 incredible
 substance.


The
 thing
 is
 if
 you
 don't
 eat
 enough


choline
 your
 baby's
 brain
 is
 not
 going


to
 get
 enough
 choline
 and
 this
 can
 have


an
 impact
 on
 the
 development
 of
 your


child.
 So
 much
 so
 that
 the
 American


Association
 of
 Pediatrics
 says
 failure


to
 provide
 choline
 during
 this
 time
 can


result
 in
 lifelong
 brain
 deficits
 in
 the


baby.


Today,
 90%
 of
 moms
 are
 not
 getting


enough
 choline
 during
 pregnancy.
 90%
 of


moms
 are
 not
 getting
 enough
 choline


during
 pregnancy.


>> Why?


>> Because
 nobody
 is
 telling
 them
 about
 it.


And
 because
 today
 we
 don't
 eat
 very


nutritious
 nutritious
 foods
 anymore
 that


contain
 a
 lot
 of
 choline.
 They're


present
 in
 eggs.
 So
 four
 eggs
 a
 day


gives
 you
 all
 the
 choline
 that
 you
 need.


But
 choline
 is
 also
 present
 in
 organ


meats
 like
 liver.
 Nobody
 eats
 liver


anymore.
 Most
 of
 the
 foods
 that
 we
 eat


today,
 cupcakes,
 dried
 fruits,
 burgers,


chips,
 they
 don't
 contain
 a
 lot
 of


choline.
 We
 need
 to
 be
 eating
 eggs.
 This


is
 the
 simplest
 way
 to
 give
 enough


choline
 to
 our
 baby.
 And
 scientists
 do


these
 animal
 studies
 where
 they
 deprive


moms
 from
 choline.
 And
 they
 look
 at
 the


impact
 on
 the
 brain.
 And
 they
 see
 that


brain
 development
 in
 the
 baby
 stops


earlier
 than
 it
 should.
 And
 those
 babies


are
 born
 with
 fewer
 neurons.
 The
 amount


of
 choline
 in
 your
 diet
 during
 pregnancy


is
 going
 to
 be
 impacting
 your
 child's


brain
 development.
 And
 nobody's
 telling


moms
 about
 this.
 It's
 really
 messed
 up.


>> So,
 how
 many
 eggs
 a
 day
 do
 I
 need
 to
 eat


while
 I'm
 pregnant
 to
 get
 enough


choline?


>> Four
 is
 the
 golden
 number.
 So,
 here
 I


think
 we
 have
 28
 eggs.
 So,
 every
 day


during
 pregnancy,
 I
 ate
 four
 eggs.
 So,


this
 is
 the
 amount
 of
 eggs
 that
 I
 ate


per
 week
 during
 the
 nine
 months
 of


pregnancy.
 That's
 a
 lot
 of
 eggs.
 But
 as


I
 was
 doing
 this,
 I
 knew
 I
 was
 giving
 my


baby
 all
 the
 choline
 that
 he
 needed,


which
 is
 about
 450
 mg
 per
 day.
 And
 this


is
 not
 very
 expensive.
 28
 eggs
 is
 about


$7.
 So
 for
 $1
 a
 day,
 you're
 getting
 all


the
 choline
 that
 your
 baby
 needs
 to
 form


his
 brain.


>> Mothers
 are
 often
 told
 to
 avoid
 liver.


>> Yeah.


>> While
 they're
 pregnant.


>> Yeah.


>> Why?
 Why
 is
 that?
 And
 you're
 saying
 that


that's
 not
 the
 correct
 advice.


>> So
 liver
 contains
 a
 lot
 of
 vitamin
 A,


quite
 high
 levels
 of
 vitamin
 A.
 And


there's
 some
 older
 studies
 that
 show


that
 liver
 and
 high
 vitamin
 A
 can
 cause


issues
 to
 the
 baby.
 That's
 why
 liver
 is


not
 usually
 recommended
 during


pregnancy.
 I
 would
 say
 check
 with
 your


doctor.
 Different
 countries
 have


different
 thresholds
 of
 how
 much
 liver


is
 allowed.
 And
 honestly,
 I
 don't
 like


liver.
 So
 I
 I
 prefer
 to
 have
 eggs,
 but


liver
 is
 super
 super
 high
 in
 choline.


It's
 quite
 impressive.
 You
 can
 also
 take


choline
 supplements,
 but
 eggs
 are
 the


cheapest,
 easiest
 source.
 And
 for


example
 in
 the
 supplement
 world,
 so


scientists
 have
 done
 this
 study
 at


Cornell.
 They
 gave
 one
 group
 of
 moms
 the


bare
 minimum
 amount
 of
 choline
 that
 is


recommended.
 So
 450
 milligrams
 in


supplements.
 And
 then
 they
 wondered,


well,
 if
 a
 baby's
 brain
 needs
 choline,


what
 happens
 if
 he
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 choline


available?
 Does
 his
 brain
 form
 even


better?
 So
 they
 gave
 the
 other
 group
 of


mom
 double
 the
 bare
 minimum
 recommended


amount.
 And
 then
 they
 brought
 the
 kids


in
 during
 their
 first
 year
 of
 age
 for


some
 tests.
 And
 the
 main
 test
 that
 was


used
 is
 you
 basically
 plop
 the
 baby
 on


his
 mom's
 lap
 in
 front
 of
 a
 computer


screen
 and
 you
 flash
 images
 on
 that


screen
 and
 you
 measure
 how
 quickly
 the


baby
 reacts
 the
 new
 images.
 So
 how


quickly
 he
 moves
 his
 eyes.
 And
 the


reason
 they
 do
 this
 is
 because
 this
 test


is
 correlated
 to
 adult
 IQ.
 Meaning
 the


faster
 a
 baby
 reacts
 to
 images
 in
 the


first
 year
 of
 age,
 the
 higher
 his
 adult


IQ.
 That's
 the
 association.
 And
 so
 they


were
 wondering,
 could
 we
 see
 a


difference
 in
 the
 baby's
 reaction
 time


depending
 on
 the
 mom's
 choline
 level
 in


the
 womb?
 And
 they
 found
 that
 the
 babies


who
 were
 born
 to
 the
 high
 choline
 moms


had
 10%
 faster
 reaction
 time
 to
 this


test.


>> People
 talk
 a
 lot
 about
 breastfeeding
 as


well,
 whether
 it's
 good,
 bad,


indifferent,
 um
 whether
 you
 can


breastfeed
 too
 much,
 etc.
 And
 obviously


there's
 um
 there's
 lots
 of


practicalities
 that
 make
 breastfeeding


quite
 difficult
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 mothers


which
 we
 probably
 should
 acknowledge.


But
 otherwise
 what
 is
 um
 what
 does
 the


research
 say
 about
 breastfeeding?


>> So
 the
 difference
 main
 difference


between
 breast
 milk
 and
 formula
 is
 that


breast
 milk
 is
 alive.
 It's
 alive
 with


information.
 It's
 alive
 with
 little


molecules
 that
 are
 going
 to
 continue


that
 DNA
 programming.
 Formula
 is
 inert.


It
 It's
 not
 alive.
 It's
 not
 doing
 that


programming.
 So
 yes,
 breastfeeding
 has


advantages
 for
 the
 mom
 and
 for
 the
 baby,


but
 formula
 is
 nutritionally
 complete


and
 it's
 very
 useful
 for
 many
 moms
 who


are
 not
 able
 or
 want
 to
 breastfeed.
 And


if
 you're
 using
 formula,
 you
 actually


have
 to
 check
 because
 today
 not
 all


formulas
 have
 choline
 in
 them.
 So
 check


in
 the
 ingredients
 for
 choline.
 Also


check
 in
 the
 ingredients
 for
 omega-3s,


which
 is
 something
 that
 we'll
 cover
 in
 a


bit.
 Look
 for
 that
 choline
 omega-3s
 in


your
 formula
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 your
 baby


is
 getting
 what
 he
 needs
 in
 those


respects.
 I
 was
 reading
 about
 a
 study
 in


the
 pediatric
 research
 journal
 that
 says


a
 2013
 Dutch
 study
 of
 120
 children
 found


that
 less
 breastfeeding
 was
 linked
 to
 a


silencing
 of
 the
 gene
 for
 leptin,


>> the
 hormone
 that
 signals
 fullness.


>> So
 that's
 a
 good
 example
 of
 epigenetic


programming.
 So
 we
 have
 this
 gene
 that


codes
 for
 leptin,
 which
 is
 a
 protein.


And
 leptin
 is
 the
 one
 of
 the
 molecules


that
 makes
 you
 feel
 full.
 So
 you
 and
 I


both
 have
 this
 leptin
 gene,
 but


depending
 on
 our
 epigenetic
 programming


on
 that
 gene,
 you
 might
 be
 producing


more
 of
 it
 and
 I
 might
 be
 producing
 less


of
 it.
 So
 for
 the
 same
 meal,
 you
 might


feel
 more
 full
 and
 I
 might
 feel
 less


full
 after
 that
 same
 exact
 meal.
 And
 so


in
 this
 study,
 they
 saw
 that
 if
 you're


not
 breastfed
 very
 long,
 your
 leptin


gene
 is
 act
 deactivated.
 So
 you
 feel


less
 full
 after
 eating.
 Now,
 these
 are


small
 associations,
 but
 they
 show
 you


that
 there's
 a
 difference
 here
 and
 that


potentially
 breastfeeding
 could
 help


your
 baby
 be
 more
 satiated
 after
 eating.


>> What
 about
 sugar
 during
 pregnancy?


>> So,
 sugar
 is
 fascinating.


When
 you
 eat
 sugar,
 your
 baby
 is
 also


receiving
 that
 sugar
 because
 that


placenta
 lets
 the
 sugar
 through.
 And


your
 baby
 doesn't
 need
 any
 sugar
 during


pregnancy.
 He
 needs
 a
 little
 bit
 of


glucose,
 which
 is
 different.
 But
 sugar,


as
 in
 the
 very
 sweet
 molecule
 of


fructose
 that
 is
 in
 chocolate,
 that
 is


in
 these
 cupcakes,
 that
 is
 in
 dried


fruit,
 your
 baby
 needs
 none
 of
 it.
 And


the
 most
 interesting
 study
 on
 sugar
 in


pregnancy
 actually
 came
 from
 the
 UK.
 So


from
 1940
 to
 1953,
 I
 don't
 know if
 you


know
 this,
 but
 in
 the
 UK,
 there
 was
 a


governmentmandated
 sugar
 ration,
 meaning


for
 13
 years,
 the
 government
 controlled


how
 much
 sugar
 people
 had
 access
 to.
 It


was
 during
 the
 war
 and
 they
 were
 trying


to
 manage
 resources.
 So
 everybody
 in
 the


UK
 got
 10
 sugar
 cubes
 per
 day.
 That's


it.
 And
 this
 is
 down
 from
 what
 people


usually
 ate
 before
 the
 sugar
 ration,


which
 was
 about
 20
 sugar
 cubes
 per
 day.


So
 everybody,
 including
 pregnant
 moms,


for
 13
 years
 had
 a
 capped
 amount
 of


sugar.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 sugar
 ration,


after
 13
 years,
 bam,
 everybody
 went
 back


up
 to
 eating
 more
 sugar.
 And
 so


scientists
 in
 the
 early
 2000s
 thought,


well,
 that's
 really
 interesting.
 This


means
 we
 have
 two
 groups
 of
 pregnant


moms
 during
 the
 sugar
 ration
 and
 right


after
 the
 sugar
 ration
 who
 had
 babies


develop
 in
 their
 womb
 either
 with
 40


grams
 of
 sugar
 per
 day
 or
 around
 80


grams
 of
 sugar
 per
 day.
 And
 the


scientists
 wondered,
 can
 this
 small


difference
 be
 making
 an
 impact
 on
 the


baby's
 long-term
 health?
 So,
 they
 called


up
 60,000
 people
 who
 were
 born
 either


just
 before
 the
 ration
 ended
 or
 just


after
 and
 they
 asked
 them
 about
 their


health.
 They
 were
 like,
 "Do
 you
 have


diabetes?
 Do
 you
 have
 heart
 disease?
 How


are
 you
 feeling?
 What's
 your
 weight?
 And


they
 saw
 that
 the
 babies
 who
 were
 born


and
 who
 were
 in
 the
 mother's
 womb
 during


the
 sugar
 ration
 had
 15%


lower
 likelihood
 of
 having
 developed


type
 2
 diabetes
 in
 their
 lifetime.
 So


what
 does
 this
 mean?
 It
 means
 that
 the


amount
 of
 sugar
 during
 pregnancy
 can
 be


slightly
 increasing
 or
 decreasing
 your


baby's
 vulnerability
 to
 getting
 type
 2


diabetes
 later
 in
 life.
 And
 today


scientists
 look
 at
 the
 epigenetics
 of


babies
 who
 are
 born
 to
 moms
 with
 very


high
 glucose
 levels
 and
 they
 see
 that


the
 genes
 that
 are
 related
 to
 diabetes


are
 activated.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 full
 picture


now
 of
 data.
 We
 have
 epigenetics.
 We


have
 this
 long-term
 interesting
 study


and
 we
 now
 see
 that
 the
 amount
 of
 sugar


that
 we
 eat
 during
 pregnancy
 is
 subtly


programming
 our
 baby.
 So
 Stephen,
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 know
 this,
 but
 when
 I


was
 25,
 I
 was
 on
 the
 cusp
 of


pre-diabetes.
 I
 almost
 had
 pre-diabetes


when
 I
 was
 25.
 I
 had
 very
 high
 glucose


levels.
 So,
 I
 had
 a
 vulnerability
 to


diabetes.
 And
 as
 I
 was
 reading
 the


studies,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 maybe


this
 has
 something
 to
 do
 with
 what
 my


mother
 was
 eating
 when
 she
 was
 pregnant


with
 me."
 Because
 pregnancy
 is
 this


window
 of
 outsized
 influence
 in


somebody's
 health.
 So,
 I
 called
 up
 my


mom.
 I
 was
 like, "Mom,
 what
 did
 you
 eat


when
 you
 were
 pregnant?"
 She
 was
 like,


"Oh,
 it
 was
 the
 ' 90s.
 You
 know,
 I
 ate


very
 little
 protein,
 very
 low
 fat.
 And


in
 the
 morning,
 every
 morning,
 I
 had
 a


big
 glass
 of
 orange
 juice
 and
 I
 had


special
 case
 cereal
 with
 about
 a
 half
 a


cup
 of
 table
 sugar
 on
 top.
 I
 was
 like,


"Huh,
 that's
 pretty
 interesting."
 So,
 I


wonder,
 I
 will
 never
 know.
 I
 wonder
 if


maybe
 my
 vulnerability
 to
 diabetes
 had


some
 roots
 in
 the
 womb.


>> And
 the
 science
 suggests
 that
 it
 does


have
 a
 correlation.


>> Absolutely.
 So,
 the
 science
 suggests


that
 the
 amount
 of
 sugar
 that
 you're


eating
 during
 pregnancy
 is
 having
 an


impact
 on
 your
 baby's
 epigenetics.
 And


today,
 so
 as
 I
 was
 mentioning,
 the
 WHO


recommends
 25
 grams
 of
 sugar
 per
 day,


but
 most
 moms
 are
 eating
 80
 grams
 of


sugar
 per
 day.
 80
 grams,
 which
 is


usually
 more
 than
 what
 they
 eat
 when


they're
 not
 pregnant,
 because
 of
 this


collective
 myth
 that
 you
 should
 eat
 for


two,
 that
 pregnancy
 you're
 going
 to
 gain


weight
 anyway,
 so
 eat
 as
 much
 sugar
 as


you
 want.
 really
 we're
 failing
 moms


because
 we're
 not
 telling
 them
 about
 the


incredible
 opportunity
 they
 have
 by
 just


being
 a
 bit
 mindful
 of
 how
 much
 sugar


they
 eat
 of
 being
 able
 to
 help
 their


baby
 be
 less
 vulnerable
 to
 diabetes.


>> It's
 not
 just
 diabetes
 though,
 is
 it?


>> No.


>> I
 was
 just
 looking
 at
 some
 of
 the


studies.
 Um
 there's
 a
 study
 here
 in
 the


JAMAMA
 network.
 It
 says
 a
 Danish
 study


found
 that
 children
 born
 to
 mothers
 with


diabetes
 had
 a
 15%
 higher
 risk
 of


psychiatric
 disorders
 with
 schizophrenia


risk
 being
 55%
 higher.
 intellectual


disability
 29%
 higher
 and
 um
 a


connection
 to
 autism
 and
 ADHD.
 A
 2025


review
 of
 200
 studies
 which
 is
 56


million
 mother
 baby
 pairs
 found
 a
 25%


higher
 risk
 of
 autism
 when
 um
 mothers


had
 diabetes
 during
 pregnancy.


>> Yeah.


>> From
 the
 Lancet
 diabetes
 and


endocrinology
 report.
 And
 it's
 important


to
 note
 that
 these
 studies
 show


correlation
 not
 causation.
 And
 a
 25%


increase
 in
 absolute
 terms
 only
 raises


the
 prevalence
 from
 one
 in
 100
 to
 around


1.25
 in
 100
 children.
 So
 there's
 some


nuance
 to
 be
 had
 on
 that.


>> There
 is
 some
 nuance,
 but
 that


association
 holds
 very
 strongly.
 And
 as


you
 said,
 56
 million
 mom
 baby
 pairs.
 So


across
 the
 world,
 we
 see
 that
 when
 a
 mom


has
 diabetes
 during
 pregnancy,
 her
 baby


has
 a
 higher
 risk
 of
 psychiatric


disorders.
 And
 the
 main
 theory
 that


could
 explain
 this
 association
 has
 to
 do


with
 the
 baby's
 brain.
 So
 your
 baby
 is


forming
 his
 brain
 in
 the
 room.
 And


today,
 Stephen,
 you
 have
 about
 a
 hundred


billion
 neurons
 in
 your
 brain
 and
 they


are
 the
 exact
 same
 neurons
 that
 you
 had


the
 day
 you
 were
 born.
 Neurons
 never
 get


replaced.
 So
 what
 does
 this
 mean?
 It


means
 that
 your
 neurons
 that
 you
 have


for
 life
 are
 formed
 during
 pregnancy
 in


your
 mother's
 uterus.
 Now
 you
 have
 these


neurons
 in
 the
 baby's
 brain
 being
 formed


250,000
 per
 minute.
 Pew,
 pew,
 pew,
 pew,


pew,
 neurons
 everywhere.
 And
 next
 to
 the


neurons,
 you
 have
 another
 type
 of
 cell.


This
 cell
 is
 called
 the
 micro
 ga.
 And
 it


kind
 of
 looks
 like
 a
 starfish,
 and
 it's


patrolling
 the
 baby's
 brain.
 And
 it's


job
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 neurons
 are


forming
 properly.
 So
 what
 micro
 ga
 do,


they're
 a
 cell
 from
 the
 immune
 system,


is
 they
 are
 on
 the
 lookout
 for
 any


neurons
 that
 are
 being
 damaged
 or
 not


formed
 properly.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 they


find
 a
 neuron
 that
 is
 not
 ideal,
 they
 go


over
 to
 it
 and
 they
 eat
 it
 and
 they


destroy
 it.
 So
 they're
 pruning
 the
 brain


and
 they're
 looking
 out
 for
 damage
 and


making
 sure
 everything
 develops


normally.
 Now
 if
 the
 mother
 has
 high


inflammation
 levels
 during
 pregnancy
 and


this
 can
 be
 caused
 by
 a
 number
 of


things.
 It
 can
 be
 caused
 by
 high
 glucose


levels.
 It
 can
 be
 caused
 by
 infection.


It
 can
 be
 caused
 by
 chemicals.
 High


inflammation
 seems
 to
 be
 making
 these


micro
 ga
 overactive.
 Now
 all
 of
 a
 sudden


they
 become
 a
 bit
 deregulated
 and
 they


start
 eating
 and
 destroying
 neurons
 that


don't
 need
 to
 be
 destroyed.
 They
 start


destroying
 healthy
 neurons
 and
 as
 a


result
 the
 brain
 is
 forming
 in
 a


slightly
 suboptimal
 fashion.
 And


scientists
 believe
 this
 to
 be
 the


leading
 theory
 behind
 why
 we
 see
 the


association
 between
 gestational


diabetes,
 so
 diabetes
 of
 pregnancy
 and
 a


higher
 risk
 of
 psychiatric
 disorders.


They
 believe
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with
 the


inflammation
 levels
 going
 on
 in
 the


baby's
 brain
 during
 pregnancy.
 And
 so


what
 does
 this
 tell
 us?
 This
 tells
 us


that
 when
 we're
 pregnant,
 we're


influencing
 the
 amount
 of
 inflammation


in
 our
 baby's
 body.
 And
 this
 should
 be


something
 that
 we
 tell
 women
 about


because
 if
 they
 can
 have
 power
 over


their
 inflammation
 levels,
 for
 example,


by
 reducing
 their
 glucose
 spikes,
 they


could
 also
 give
 their
 baby
 a
 benefit
 to


its
 brain
 formation.
 Do
 you
 think
 it's


useful
 for
 women
 during
 pregnancy
 to


wear
 those
 continuous
 glucose
 monitors?


>> I
 did.
 I
 did
 the
 whole
 time.
 Is
 it


useful?
 Depends
 on
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do.


I
 think
 it's
 really
 interesting.
 It


helped
 me
 a
 lot.
 Maybe
 just
 for
 two


weeks
 could
 be
 cool.
 So,
 you
 can
 kind
 of


see
 what's
 going
 on
 and
 learn
 about
 your


glucose
 spikes.
 And
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


issues
 we
 see
 during
 pregnancy
 is
 that


your
 glucose
 levels
 are
 usually
 tested


in
 the
 third
 trimester
 with
 the
 diabetes


test,


>> but
 by
 that
 time
 like
 you've
 already


been
 going
 going
 along
 for
 6
 months
 with


your
 glucose
 levels.
 I
 think
 we
 should


be
 testing
 glucose
 levels
 much
 much


earlier
 like
 in
 the
 first
 trimester


because
 your
 glucose
 levels
 in
 the
 first


trimester
 actually
 can
 predict
 very
 well


whether
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 gestational


diabetes
 or
 not.
 So,
 I
 think
 we
 should


maybe
 put
 a
 glucose
 monitor
 on
 all


pregnant
 moms
 in
 the
 first
 trimester
 or


even
 pre-reg
 to
 help
 them
 understand


their
 glucose
 spikes
 and
 show
 them
 about


these
 easy
 tools
 and
 habits
 and
 hacks


that
 you
 can
 put
 in
 place
 to
 reduce
 your


glucose
 spikes.


>> I
 was
 reading
 about
 a
 study
 from


Diabetes
 Care
 that
 said
 they
 put
 um


these
 continuous
 glucose
 monitors
 on
 700


women
 and
 found
 that
 if
 they
 did
 it
 in


the
 first
 trimester,
 they
 could


accurately
 predict
 who
 would
 develop


gestational
 diabetes
 at
 24
 to
 28
 weeks.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 that's
 really
 interesting


because
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 used
 to
 think


that
 gestational
 diabetes,
 meaning


diabetes
 during
 pregnancy,
 is
 kind
 of


random.
 It
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 you
 get
 it,


but
 we
 don't
 know
 why.
 It's
 random.
 Your


body's
 just
 doing
 this."
 And
 now
 we
 have


evidence
 that
 suggests
 that
 actually


it's
 correlated
 to
 your
 glucose
 levels


in
 the
 first
 trimester.
 Now,
 in
 the


first
 trimester,
 your
 glucose
 levels
 are


pretty
 much
 the
 same
 as
 when
 you're
 not


pregnant.
 As
 pregnancy
 progresses,


hormones
 come
 into
 play
 and
 things
 start


shifting.
 Glucose
 spikes
 get
 bigger
 and


longer.
 fasting
 glucose
 levels
 becomes


lower.
 But
 that
 first
 trimester,
 your


glucose
 spikes
 and
 your
 glucose
 levels


are
 similar
 to
 pre-preg.
 This
 means
 that


essentially
 your
 non-pregant
 glucose


levels
 can
 predict
 whether
 or
 not
 you're


going
 to
 get
 gestational
 diabetes.
 Which


means
 that
 gestational
 diabetes
 is
 not


random.
 It
 actually
 has
 roots
 in
 what


was
 happening
 before
 pregnancy.
 Meaning


that
 if
 you
 had
 high
 glucose
 levels


before
 pregnancy,
 you're
 more
 likely
 to


get
 gestational
 diabetes.
 Gestational


diabetes
 could
 actually
 just
 be
 a


symptom
 of
 having
 high
 glucose
 levels


before
 pregnancy
 but
 just
 not
 knowing


about
 it.


>> You
 know,
 when
 we
 say
 high
 glucose


levels,
 is
 that
 a
 very
 individual
 thing?


>> No,


>> it's
 not
 an
 individual
 thing.


>> No,
 we
 have
 very
 clear
 cut
 offs.
 So,
 for


example,
 if
 you're
 not
 pregnant
 like
 you


and
 I,
 100
 milligrams
 per
 deciliter
 is


the
 cut
 off
 between
 healthy
 and


pre-diabetes.


So,
 that's
 fasting
 glucose
 level,
 your


glucose
 level
 first
 thing
 in
 the


morning.
 If
 you're
 pregnant,
 that


changes.
 Anything
 above
 92
 milligrams


per
 deciliter
 is
 considered
 diabetes
 of


pregnancy.
 So
 high
 glucose
 levels,
 it's


it's
 very
 well
 segmented.
 We
 have
 these


very
 specific
 ranges
 that
 say
 normal,


too
 high,
 much
 too
 high.


>> But
 if
 me
 and
 you
 both
 have
 this
 um
 a


teaspoon
 of
 this
 honey
 that
 I
 have
 here


on
 the
 desk,
 our
 responses
 to
 this
 honey


are
 going to
 be
 completely
 different,


right?


>> Yeah.
 The
 glucose
 spike
 we
 experience
 is


going
 to
 be
 different
 for
 a
 bunch
 of


reasons.
 Our
 microbiome,
 our
 genetics,


how
 much
 muscle
 mass
 we
 have,
 how


hydrated,
 how
 stressed,
 how
 tired
 we
 we


are.
 So
 maybe
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 a


spike
 of
 like,
 I
 don't
 know,
 30
 30


milligrams
 and
 maybe
 I'll
 get
 a
 45


milligram
 spike
 because
 I'm
 tired.
 Now,


what
 does
 that
 mean?
 It
 doesn't
 mean


that
 honey
 is
 necessarily
 better
 for
 you


than
 it
 is
 for
 me.
 It
 just
 means
 that
 my


body
 today
 is
 more
 or
 less
 good
 at


managing
 this
 influx
 of
 glucose


>> today.


>> Today.
 Yeah.
 Today.
 And
 it
 also
 means


something
 very
 important,
 which
 is
 that


if
 you
 and
 I
 both
 used
 a
 glucose
 hack.


So,
 for example,
 if
 you
 and
 I
 both
 had
 a


chicken
 breast
 before
 the
 honey,
 both


you
 and
 I
 would
 have
 a
 smaller
 glucose


spike
 from
 that
 same
 honey.
 So,
 glucose


hacks
 and
 ways
 to
 reduce
 your
 glucose


spikes
 work
 in
 everyone.
 The
 exact


absolute
 values
 after
 eating
 something,


these
 can
 vary.
 But
 one
 thing
 that
 is


true
 for
 everybody
 is
 that
 you're


fasting
 glucose.
 So
 glucose
 before
 you


eat
 anything.
 That
 is
 something
 we
 can


compare.
 So
 if
 you
 and
 I
 both
 at
 7
 a.m.


before
 we
 eat
 anything
 and
 we
 had
 our


fasting
 glucose
 levels
 checked,
 we
 could


compare.
 We
 could
 say,
 "Oh,
 Jesse
 is


very
 close
 to
 pre-diabetes
 and
 Steven
 is


not
 very
 close
 to
 pre-diabetes."
 Those


are
 very
 easy
 numbers
 to
 compare.
 the


spikes
 after
 eating.
 These
 can
 vary.


>> So,
 if
 I
 put
 on
 a
 little
 bit
 more


muscle,
 that
 means
 that
 I'll
 tolerate


glucose
 better.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 your
 muscles
 are
 an


amazing
 sink
 where
 your
 body
 is
 soaking


up
 glucose
 from
 your
 bloodstream.
 And


that's
 why
 we
 see
 that
 even
 during


pregnancy,
 having
 high
 muscle
 mass
 is


protective
 against
 diabetes.
 So,
 women


with
 higher
 muscle
 mass
 in
 pregnancy
 are


less
 likely
 to
 have
 gestational


diabetes.
 Let
 me
 give
 you
 an
 example.


So,
 we
 we
 eat
 this
 honey.
 What
 happens?


The
 honey
 goes
 from
 our
 mouth
 to
 our


stomach
 to
 our
 intestine
 and
 then
 it


goes
 through
 our
 intestinal
 wall
 into


our
 bloodstream.
 So
 all
 these
 glucose


molecules
 are
 arriving
 into
 our


bloodstream.
 Now
 there's
 two
 options.


Either
 we
 stay
 here
 and
 we
 don't
 move.


In
 that
 case,
 glucose
 is
 going
 to
 rise


in
 our
 bloodstream,
 big
 glucose
 spike,


and
 then
 crash.
 Or
 we
 say,
 "Okay,
 let's


go
 outside
 and
 go
 for
 a
 walk
 right
 after


we
 eat
 this
 honey."
 We're
 walking.
 Our


muscles
 are
 contracting.
 Our
 leg
 muscles


are
 contracting.
 Our
 arm
 muscles
 are


contracting.
 And
 these
 muscles
 as


they're
 contracting,
 they're
 looking
 for


energy.
 And
 the
 first
 place
 they
 look
 is


in
 the
 bloodstream.
 They
 look
 for


glucose
 in
 the
 bloodstream.
 Which
 is
 why


if
 you
 move
 after
 you
 eat
 glucose,
 you


will
 get
 a
 smaller
 glucose
 spike
 because


some
 of
 that
 glucose
 is
 being
 used
 by


your
 muscles
 for
 energy.


>> I've
 heard
 you
 tell
 people
 that
 they


should
 uh
 do
 some
 stuff
 with
 their


calves.


>> Calf
 raises.
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So,
 put
 your


feet
 on
 the
 ground,
 Stephen.
 Yeah.


>> And
 just
 do
 some
 calf
 push-ups.
 Calf


raises.
 So
 you
 go
 up
 onto
 the
 ends
 of


your
 feet
 and
 back
 down.


>> Okay.
 So
 you
 got
 it.
 I'm
 going
 up.
 I'm


lifting
 my
 heels.


>> Exactly.
 Lift
 your
 heels
 up
 and
 down.
 So


as
 you
 do
 this,
 there's
 a
 muscle
 in
 your


calf
 called
 the
 soles
 muscle.
 Can
 you


feel
 it
 contract?
 It's
 your
 calf
 muscle.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So
 this
 muscle
 is
 very
 good
 at


soaking
 up
 glucose
 from
 your


bloodstream.
 So
 easy
 hack
 you
 can
 do


after
 you
 eat
 something
 sweet
 is
 you


just
 do
 some
 calf
 raises
 at
 your
 desk


like
 this.
 Nobody
 can
 notice.
 Five


minutes
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 help
 reduce


the
 glucose
 spike
 of
 what
 you
 just
 ate.


I
 mean
 five
 five
 minutes.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 you
 can
 do
 five
 minutes.
 In


the
 studies
 they
 do
 sometimes
 hours
 of


this
 but
 even
 just
 one
 minute
 is
 better


than
 nothing
 to
 reduce
 your
 glucose


spike.


>> I
 mean
 this
 is
 probably
 why
 a
 lot of


cultures
 go
 for
 a
 walk
 after
 dinner.


Right.


>> Completely.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 glucose


hacks
 that
 I've
 talked
 about,
 they


actually
 mirror
 a
 lot
 of
 traditions.
 So


for example,
 the
 glucose
 hack
 of
 having


your
 vegetables
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 your


meal.
 This
 is
 incredibly
 powerful,


pregnancy
 or
 not
 pregnancy,
 because


vegetables
 contain
 fiber.
 And
 when
 you


have
 them
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 your
 meal,


they
 create
 this
 protective
 mesh
 in
 your


intestine
 that
 slows
 down
 the
 glucose


molecules
 from
 carbs
 and
 makes
 the


glucose
 molecules
 arrive
 more
 slowly


into
 your
 bloodstream,
 meaning
 smaller


spike.
 Now,
 eating
 veggies
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 meal,
 that's
 something


that
 we
 call
 kurite
 in
 France,
 which


means
 raw
 veggies
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


your
 meal.


What
 other
 simple
 exercises
 do
 you


recommend
 if
 I've
 just
 eaten
 something


that's
 high
 in
 glucose
 that
 I
 can
 do


quickly
 to
 help
 bring
 down
 my
 glucose


spike?
 Right?
 That's
 ultimately
 what


it's
 going
 to
 do.
 Bring
 down
 the
 spike.


>> The
 best
 thing
 to
 do
 is
 to
 move
 your


body.
 So
 get
 up,
 find
 a
 spot
 in
 your


apartment
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 tidied.
 Find


a
 place
 you
 got
 to
 vacuum.
 Find
 some


find
 some
 laundry
 to
 do
 and
 do
 that


within
 90
 minutes
 after
 eating.
 Your


muscles
 are
 your
 best
 ally
 in
 reducing


your
 glucose
 spikes
 after
 you've
 eaten.


So,
 what's
 going
 on
 there?
 I
 I
 start


eating
 a
 cake.
 I
 finish
 eating
 the
 cake.


How
 long
 have
 I
 got
 to
 get
 that
 cake


into
 my
 muscles?


>> That's
 a
 great
 way
 to
 put
 it.
 You
 have


about
 90
 minutes.
 So,
 an
 hour
 and
 a


half.


>> Okay.


>> That's
 when
 the
 spike
 is
 usually
 going


to
 be
 at
 at
 its
 maximum.


>> So,
 if
 I
 start
 squatting,


>> yeah,
 squats
 are
 a
 great
 great
 tool.


>> I
 want
 to
 go
 for
 a
 big
 muscle,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 So
 there's
 some


studies
 showing
 that
 if
 you
 do
 I
 think


it's
 five
 squats
 or
 10
 squats
 every
 5


minutes
 that
 is
 a
 very
 very
 powerful
 way


to
 get
 your
 glucose
 spike
 down.
 Now
 you


don't
 always
 have
 the
 space
 to
 do
 some


squats
 but
 if
 you're
 alone
 and
 at
 home


go
 for
 it.
 That's
 one
 of
 the
 best
 ones.


>> So
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 my
 body
 there
 is


my
 I
 start
 squatting
 I'm
 working
 my


glutes.


>> Yeah.
 So
 your
 glutes
 are
 looking
 for


energy
 and
 the
 first
 place
 they
 look
 is


in
 your
 blood.
 They're
 looking
 for


glucose


>> because
 glucose
 is
 the
 energy
 that
 your


muscles
 are
 using.
 Okay.
 Well,
 do
 you


use
 standing
 desks?
 I've
 really
 got
 into


it.


>> Yeah,
 I
 do.
 I
 have
 a
 desk
 at
 home
 that


moves
 up
 and
 down.


>> Same.


>> Yeah.
 But
 sometimes
 if
 I'm
 tired,
 I
 just


are
 more
 tired
 with
 the
 standing
 desk.


So,
 I
 have
 to
 have
 a
 bit
 of
 energy
 left


over.
 Do
 you
 always
 use
 a
 standing
 desk?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 kind
 of
 oscillate
 between


standing
 and
 sitting.
 But
 I
 think


especially
 in
 like
 the
 morning,
 I
 find


it
 to
 be
 really,
 really
 good.


>> You
 just
 gave
 me
 an
 idea
 for
 a
 glucose


test.
 I
 should
 do
 the
 same
 muffin
 and


afterwards
 standing
 desk
 for
 30
 minutes


or
 sitting
 at
 the
 desk
 for
 30
 minutes.


That's
 a
 great
 test.


>> Well,
 we
 need
 to
 put
 some
 uh
 Stella


glucose
 monitors
 on
 before.
 But
 yes,
 we


can
 do
 it.
 We
 should
 do
 it.
 So,
 I
 will


eat
 a
 muffin
 first
 thing
 in
 the
 morning,


then
 stand
 for
 30
 minutes,
 and
 the
 next


day
 I
 will
 eat
 a
 muffin
 first
 thing
 in


the
 morning,
 and
 then
 sit
 for
 30


minutes,
 and
 I'll
 send
 you
 the
 spike,


and
 we
 can
 see
 we
 can
 see
 how
 much


glucose
 is
 being
 burned
 when
 we're


standing
 at
 our
 desk.


>> Okay.
 Well,
 we're
 gonna
 put
 that
 the


results
 in
 the
 episode.
 Okay,
 great.


Now,
 so
 what
 you
 see
 on
 the
 screen,
 if


you're
 watching,
 is
 the
 results
 of
 Jesse


standing
 after
 having
 a
 muffin,


and
 then
 these
 results,
 which
 you
 see
 on


the
 screen,
 are
 Jesse
 sitting
 after


having
 a
 muffin.


>> And
 either
 we'll
 see
 that
 the
 spikes
 are


very
 similar,


>> which
 means
 that
 standing
 doesn't
 use


much
 more
 muscle
 energy
 than
 sitting,
 or


we
 will
 see
 that
 standing
 is
 using
 up


some
 of
 the
 glucose
 from
 my
 bloodstream.


and
 therefore
 the
 spike
 is
 smaller
 after


the
 muffin.


>> On
 that
 point
 of
 exercise,
 mothers
 are


given
 conflicting
 advice
 about
 what
 to


do
 when
 they're
 pregnant.
 Um,


some
 people
 say
 exercise
 is
 not
 good.


Some
 people
 say
 it's
 great.
 What's
 your


position
 from
 all
 the
 research
 you've


done
 as
 to
 whether
 mothers
 should
 be


doing
 exercise
 during
 pregnancy?


>> Exercise
 is
 incredibly
 good
 for
 your


baby's
 development.
 And
 there's
 one


study
 done
 in
 animals
 because
 we
 can't


do
 many
 studies
 in
 in
 humans
 when
 it


comes
 to
 pregnancy
 for
 obvious
 ethical


reasons,
 but
 there's
 this
 incredible


study
 which
 I
 think
 is
 my
 favorite
 study


in
 the
 book.
 So
 scientists
 took
 two


groups
 of
 pregnant
 rats
 and
 they
 gave


them
 the
 exact
 same
 housing
 conditions,


diet,
 lighting,
 everything.
 The
 only


difference
 is
 that
 one
 group
 also
 had


these
 tiny
 little
 treadmills
 that
 they


had
 to
 walk
 on
 for
 30
 minutes
 a
 day


every
 day
 during
 pregnancy.
 So,
 same


exact
 conditions.
 The
 only
 difference
 is


one
 group
 of
 pregnant
 rats
 is
 moving
 30


minutes
 a
 day
 on
 these
 tiny
 treadmills.


Then
 they
 wait
 for
 the
 babies
 to
 be
 born


and
 they
 put
 the
 babies
 in
 these
 mazes


to
 kind
 of
 measure
 how
 quickly
 they're


solving
 the
 maze.
 And
 they
 also
 measure


the
 baby's
 anxiety
 levels.
 They
 found


that
 the
 babies
 that
 were
 born
 to
 the


moms
 who
 were
 exercising
 solved
 the
 maze


twice
 as
 fast
 and
 had
 fewer
 anxiety


symptoms.


So
 they
 found
 this
 strong
 association


between
 a
 mom
 exercising
 during


pregnancy
 and
 the
 outcomes
 of
 the
 baby's


brain.


>> H


>> and
 the
 main
 theory
 is
 that
 when
 we


exercise,
 there's
 this
 molecule
 produced


in
 our
 brain
 called
 BDNF.
 And
 it's
 got
 a


complicated
 name,
 but
 what
 it
 does
 is


that
 it
 helps
 neuroplasticity.
 It
 helps


your
 neurons
 create
 new
 connections.
 And


we
 know
 that
 in
 humans
 when
 we
 exercise,


that's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 exercise
 is


good
 for
 the
 brain
 because
 it
 increases


BDNF.
 And
 in
 these
 pregnant
 rats,
 they


found
 not
 only
 were
 the
 mom's
 BDNFs


higher,
 but
 the
 baby's
 BDNF
 levels


inside
 of
 the
 wombs
 was
 also
 higher.
 and


they
 believe
 that
 is
 why
 they
 saw
 this


impact
 on
 the
 baby's
 brain
 development


after
 birth.
 So
 what
 happens
 in
 the
 womb


is
 really
 setting
 up
 a
 strong
 foundation


for
 your
 baby's
 brain.
 It's
 laying
 out


the
 basic
 architecture,
 which
 is
 why


it's
 so
 important
 to
 do
 these
 simple


hacks
 to
 give
 your
 baby's
 brain
 the


optimal
 nutrients
 that
 it
 needs
 to
 form


properly.


>> What
 is
 um
 there's
 a
 little
 metaphor


over
 there,
 those
 two
 plant
 pots.
 What


is
 the
 metaphor?


Okay,
 so


both
 of
 these
 plants
 come
 from
 identical


seeds.
 The
 only
 difference
 is
 what
 they


were
 planted
 in.
 So,
 one
 of
 these
 plants


was
 planted
 in
 basically
 little
 rocks


and
 gravel
 with
 a
 tiny
 bit
 of
 soil
 in


it.
 The
 other
 seed
 was
 planted
 in
 rich


fertilized
 soil.
 What
 is
 this
 showing


us?
 We
 intuitively
 understand
 that
 when


we're
 planting
 a
 seed,
 the
 soil
 we


choose
 is
 important,
 right?
 We


understand
 that
 the
 same
 seed
 is
 not


going
 to
 lead
 to
 the
 same
 tree
 depending


on
 where
 we
 plant
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 for


pregnancy,
 we've
 lost
 this
 intuition


because
 your
 baby
 is
 a
 seed.
 You
 as
 the


mother's
 body,
 you
 are
 the
 soil
 and
 the


soil
 is
 going
 to
 co-create
 your
 baby's


plan.
 So,
 when
 you're
 pregnant,
 you
 have


this
 little
 baby
 with
 his
 DNA
 plan,
 but


depending
 on
 depending
 on
 the
 nutrients


you
 provide,
 he's
 going
 to
 grow
 into
 a


different
 tree.
 He's
 either
 going
 to


grow
 in
 a
 super
 optimal
 tree
 that
 has


all
 the
 nutrients
 he
 needed,
 or
 he's


going
 to
 have
 to
 adapt
 to
 what's


available
 and
 grow
 into
 a
 slightly


different
 tree.
 Now,
 the
 main
 difference


is
 that
 humans
 are
 not
 plants.
 So,


humans
 are
 very
 resilient.
 your
 baby


will
 probably
 be
 okay.
 Even
 if
 like
 90%


of
 us
 you
 don't
 have
 enough
 choline,


even
 if
 like
 75%
 of
 us
 you
 don't
 have


enough
 omega-3s,
 even
 if
 like
 70%
 of
 us


you
 don't
 have
 enough
 protein,
 and
 even


if
 like
 most
 of
 us
 you're
 eating
 more


than
 the
 recommended
 amount
 of
 sugar,


your
 baby
 will
 probably
 be
 fine,
 but
 he


will
 be
 adapting
 to
 a
 slightly


sub-optimal
 nutrient
 environment.
 So


that's
 what
 this
 metaphor
 is
 all
 about.


You're
 co-creating
 the
 plan
 of
 your
 baby


with
 your
 diet
 during
 pregnancy
 and
 it's


shaping
 him
 and
 he's
 adapting
 and


calibrating
 to
 what
 you're
 giving
 him.


>> Steve,
 what
 you
 doing?


>> Uh,
 just
 making
 myself
 a
 delicious


coffee


>> from
 the
 freezer.


>> From
 the
 freezer?
 Have
 you
 not
 heard


about
 CompTI?


>> No.


>> Oh
 my
 gosh,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 change
 your


life.
 A
 couple
 of
 months
 ago,
 the


founder
 of
 this
 business
 called
 Matt


sent
 a
 big
 shipment
 of
 this
 coffee
 to


our
 office
 in
 London.
 This
 coffee
 is


like
 nothing
 you've
 ever
 seen
 before.


What
 most
 people
 don't
 know
 is
 that
 the


processing
 of
 coffee
 takes
 out
 a
 lot
 of


the
 taste.
 So
 what
 they
 do
 is
 they
 flash


freeze
 it
 at
 the
 optimal
 moment
 when


it's
 most
 tasty
 and
 they
 send
 you
 in
 the


post
 the
 coffee
 in
 these
 little
 frozen


ice
 cubes.
 Now
 Matt
 sent
 a
 big
 shipment


to
 my
 office.
 I
 moved
 it
 to
 the
 kitchen.


I
 said
 to
 the
 team,
 "Knock
 yourselves


out.
 Give
 this
 a
 try."
 And
 then
 I
 saw
 so


many
 messages
 in
 our
 Slack
 channel
 of


people
 going,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 what
 the
 hell


is
 that?
 It's
 so
 delicious.
 All
 I
 have


to
 do
 is
 pop
 it
 out
 in
 the
 morning
 using


the
 little
 button
 on
 the
 back
 of
 this


thing.
 I
 pour
 my
 hot
 water
 in
 and
 I
 mix


it
 and
 that
 is
 done.
 You
 can
 get
 $30
 off


your
 first
 order
 of
 cometier
 coffee
 if


you
 go
 to
 cometier.com/stephven


and
 it
 won't
 be
 available
 for
 long.
 So


get
 that
 discount
 while
 you
 can.
 I
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 pregnant
 mother
 in
 my


life,
 but
 I
 am
 going
 to
 have
 a
 fiance


hopefully
 at
 some
 point
 who
 is
 a


pregnant
 mother.
 So,
 I
 would
 really
 like


to
 know
 how
 I
 can
 help
 as
 a
 partner,
 but


also
 I'm
 sure
 she's
 going
 to
 listen
 to


this.
 So,
 what
 she
 can
 do
 to
 make
 sure


that
 the
 soil
 in
 which
 my
 baby
 grows
 is


optimal.
 We've
 talked
 about
 a
 few
 of
 the


things
 so
 far
 like
 choline
 and
 we've
 al


also
 talked
 about
 sugar
 and
 glucose


levels
 throughout
 pregnancy
 to
 avoid


gestational
 diabetes.
 We've
 talked
 about


exercise
 as
 well.
 What
 about
 alcohol?


>> Not
 a
 good
 idea
 because
 as
 I
 explained,


your
 bloodstream
 and
 your
 baby's


bloodstream
 are
 basically
 connected.
 So


when
 you
 drink
 alcohol
 during
 pregnancy,


your
 blood
 alcohol
 level
 rises
 and
 then


your
 baby's
 blood
 alcohol
 level
 in
 your


uterus
 also
 rises.
 There's
 no
 filter


protecting
 your
 baby
 from
 alcohol.
 So


when
 you
 have
 a
 glass
 of
 wine,
 your


baby's
 also
 having
 a
 glass
 of
 wine
 in


the
 womb.
 And
 we
 know
 that
 alcohol
 is


not
 good
 for
 our
 brains.
 And
 this
 also


goes
 for
 babies.
 So,
 you
 wouldn't
 put


red
 wine
 in
 your
 baby's
 bottle
 after


birth
 and
 give
 him
 red
 wine
 to
 drink,


but
 that's
 kind
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 when


you're
 drinking
 alcohol
 when
 you're


pregnant.
 And
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 a


lot
 of
 stuff
 online
 about,
 oh,
 alcohol


during
 pregnancy
 is
 fine
 in
 small


quantities.
 I
 think
 when
 you
 understand


how
 alcohol
 is
 toxic
 to
 the
 brain


biologically,
 it
 makes
 no
 sense
 to


pregnant
 moms
 that
 a
 little
 bit
 of


alcohol
 is
 okay.
 It's
 best
 if
 you
 can
 to


avoid
 alcohol
 entirely.


>> So,
 complete
 abstinence.
 Yeah,


>> there
 was
 actually
 a
 study
 that
 came
 out


in
 February
 last
 year,
 which
 is
 quite


recent,
 from
 the
 University
 of


Melbourne,
 where
 they
 used


highresolution
 3D
 imaging
 to
 reveal
 that


even
 low
 doses
 of
 alcohol
 cause
 facial


morphing,
 consistent
 changes
 in
 the


shape
 of
 the
 eyes
 and
 nose
 at
 12
 months,


persisting
 up
 to
 age
 8,
 and
 weaker


connections
 in
 the
 in
 the
 right
 um


anterior
 singulate
 part
 of
 the
 brain,


the
 region
 critical
 for
 emotional


regulation
 and
 impulse
 control,
 even
 if


the
 mother
 drank
 only
 occasionally.


which
 is


very
 um
 surprising


because
 I
 think
 for
 a
 long
 time
 we've


always
 thought
 that
 heavy
 consumption
 of


alcohol
 was
 a
 problem


>> and
 we
 know
 that.
 Yeah.


>> But
 even
 low
 doses
 are
 suboptimal.


>> It's
 kind
 of
 it
 kind
 of
 goes
 for
 all


adults,
 right?
 We
 thought
 for
 a
 long


time
 that
 one
 glass
 of
 wine
 per
 day
 was


good
 for
 the
 heart.
 Now
 we
 understand


that
 the
 ideal
 amount
 of
 alcohol
 is


zero.
 Like
 there's
 no
 benefit
 to


alcohol.
 Now,
 is
 that
 to
 say
 that
 one


glass
 of
 wine
 during
 pregnancy
 is
 going


to,
 you
 know,
 indelibly
 impact
 your


baby's
 brain?
 Probably
 not.
 But
 if
 you


can
 avoid
 it,
 this
 is
 the
 best
 time
 to


avoid
 it
 entirely.


>> What
 about
 when
 you're
 breastfeeding?


>> Oo.
 Well,
 you
 have
 much
 more
 leeway
 then


because
 the
 amount
 of
 alcohol
 in
 your


breast
 milk
 mirrors
 the
 amount
 of


alcohol
 in
 your
 bloodstream.
 So,
 for


example,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 glass
 of
 wine,


two
 and
 a
 half
 to
 three
 hours
 later,
 you


have
 pretty
 much
 no
 more
 alcohol
 in
 your


bloodstream,
 which
 means
 your
 breast


milk
 is
 also
 pretty
 much
 devoid
 of


alcohol.
 So,
 if
 you
 time
 it
 right,


you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 have
 a
 glass


of
 wine
 without
 it
 actually
 going
 into


your
 breast
 milk.
 But,
 it's
 all
 about


timing.


>> Caffeine,


>> the
 recommendation
 is
 to
 stay
 under
 two


cups
 of
 coffee
 per
 day
 during
 pregnancy.


Um,
 it's
 not
 a
 neurotoxin
 like
 alcohol,


right?
 But
 caffeine
 does
 go
 to
 your


baby's
 bloodstream.
 And
 some
 studies


show
 that
 babies
 are
 more
 active
 in
 the


womb
 after
 the
 mother
 drinks
 caffeine


and
 it
 has
 no
 benefit.
 So
 listen,
 you
 do


what
 you
 can.
 I
 reduced
 a
 little
 bit
 my


caffeine
 intake.
 Instead
 of
 having
 like


two
 fat
 whites,
 I
 had
 maybe
 half
 a
 flat


white
 or
 a
 decaf
 fat
 white
 when
 I
 could.


But
 some
 days
 I
 just
 really
 wanted
 a


coffee,
 so
 I
 had
 a
 coffee.


>> Have
 they
 ever
 done
 any
 studies
 on


caffeine
 and
 pregnancy?
 Well,
 we
 can't


do
 any
 studies
 on
 caffeine
 in
 pregnancy


in
 humans.
 It's
 unethical
 to
 test


anything
 in
 pregnant
 moms.
 We
 have


associations
 and
 the
 associations
 don't


show
 much
 difference.
 Like
 we
 don't
 have


studies
 that
 show
 caffeine
 intake
 in


moms
 leads
 to
 this
 kind
 of
 bad
 outcome


in
 the
 kids.
 It
 seems
 pretty
 neutral
 at


low
 doses.
 If
 you
 have
 really
 high
 doses


of
 caffeine,
 there
 is
 an
 impact
 on
 the


baby's
 well
 associative
 impact
 on
 the


baby's
 temperament.
 But
 for
 one
 or
 two


cups
 a
 day,
 there's
 no
 impact
 that
 we


find.


>> And
 they've
 done
 animal
 studies.
 Yeah,


they've
 done
 animal
 studies.
 Low
 doses


also
 fine.
 Very
 high
 doses,
 we
 start
 to


see
 changes
 in
 the
 baby's
 behavior.


>> You
 talk
 about
 this
 in
 the
 book.
 In


certain
 animal
 studies,
 they
 show
 um


during
 pregnancy
 leads
 to
 smaller


offspring,
 altered
 heart
 development,


and
 delayed
 brain
 growth.
 Um
 but
 you


explain
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 direct


clinical
 trial
 data
 on
 the
 long-term


impact
 of
 caffeine
 during
 human


pregnancy.


>> And
 also
 those
 studies
 are
 very
 high


doses
 of
 caffeine.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 And
 the
 World
 Health


Organization
 recommends
 that
 women
 who


consume
 more
 than
 300
 milligrams
 of


coffee
 a
 day,
 which
 is
 roughly
 three


cups,
 reduce
 their
 daily
 intake
 during


pregnancy.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 probably
 one
 cup
 a
 day
 is
 not


harming
 your
 baby.


>> Fermented
 foods
 in
 the
 gut.
 What
 about


that?
 Yeah.


>> What
 should
 I
 be
 thinking
 about
 there?


>> Well,
 this
 is
 very
 early
 research,
 but


showing
 that
 potentially
 if
 a
 mother
 has


fermented
 food
 during
 pregnancy,
 it's


also
 seeding
 her
 baby's
 gut
 microbiome.


But
 this
 is
 very,
 very
 early
 stuff.
 But


if
 you
 can
 include
 some
 kefir
 or
 some


sauerkraut
 during
 pregnancy,
 it's


helpful.


>> What
 What
 about
 bread?
 Do
 you
 think
 much


about
 bread?


>> Do
 I
 think
 much
 about
 bread?
 I
 mean,
 I'm


French,
 so
 I
 think
 about
 bread
 all
 the


time.


>> In
 terms
 of
 um
 your
 recommendations
 on


the
 type
 of
 bread
 one
 should
 be
 eating.


>> Well,
 bread
 is
 interesting
 because
 bread


is
 a
 carb
 that
 contains
 mostly
 glucose.


And
 we
 know
 that
 in
 the
 third
 trimester


of
 pregnancy,
 your
 baby
 actually
 needs


more
 glucose
 cuz
 he's
 developing
 and
 he


also
 needs
 energy.
 Your
 baby
 needs
 about


70
 gram
 of
 glucose
 per
 day
 at
 the
 very


end
 of
 pregnancy.
 So,
 as
 a
 pregnant
 mom,


you
 should
 be
 eating
 70
 grams
 of
 glucose


more
 than
 you
 usually
 do
 at
 the
 end
 of


pregnancy.
 For
 the
 first
 and
 second


trimesters,
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 be
 eating


much
 more
 glucose.
 So,
 you
 could
 have


that
 via
 bread.
 You
 could
 have
 that
 via


rice,
 for example.
 So
 70
 gram
 of
 glucose


is
 about
 three
 slices
 of
 bread
 or
 a
 cup


and
 a
 half
 of
 rice.
 In
 terms
 of
 the
 type


of
 bread
 you
 should
 be
 eating,
 it's


always
 better
 for
 your
 glucose
 levels
 to


have
 bread
 that
 is
 full
 of
 seeds.
 But
 to


be
 honest,
 there's
 not
 a
 huge
 difference


between
 like
 sprouted
 grain
 bread
 versus


white
 bread.
 It's
 all
 just
 glucose


>> because
 there
 there
 is
 a
 I
 guess
 there's


a
 a
 risk
 that
 mothers
 might
 get
 a
 little


bit
 scared
 of
 having
 sugary
 foods
 during


pregnancy.
 And
 then
 you've
 just
 said
 the


baby
 does
 need
 glucose.


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 a
 difference.
 So


glucose
 is
 present
 in
 carbs
 and


starches,
 meaning
 bread,
 pasta,
 rice,


potatoes,
 oats.
 So
 starches
 contain


glucose,
 but
 starches
 are
 different
 to


sugars.
 So
 on
 this
 plate,
 we
 only
 have


sugars.
 These
 are
 the
 sweet
 foods
 that


contain
 glucose,
 but
 also
 another


molecule
 that
 makes
 them
 sweet
 called


fructose.
 Your
 baby
 needs
 no
 fructose


during
 pregnancy
 ever.
 So
 your
 baby
 does


not
 need
 any
 sugar
 from
 dessert,
 from


chocolate,
 from
 muffins,
 from
 cupcakes.


Your
 baby
 needs
 none
 of
 this.
 But
 your


baby
 does
 need
 glucose,
 which
 is


healthier
 to
 get
 from
 starches
 like


bread,
 pasta,
 rice,
 potatoes.


>> What
 about
 the
 ketogenic
 diet
 while


you're
 pregnant?


>> I
 don't
 think
 there's
 enough
 evidence
 to


tell
 us
 whether
 it's
 okay
 or
 not.
 It's


very
 early.
 It's
 quite
 rare.
 Um,
 and
 it


seems
 that
 since
 your
 baby
 does
 need


glucose
 during
 pregnancy,
 it's
 just


easier
 to
 eat
 glucose
 and
 to
 eat


starches
 when
 you're
 pregnant.
 And
 whole


fruit
 is
 also
 a
 good
 way
 of
 getting
 the


glucose
 that
 you
 need
 because
 thanks
 to


the
 fiber
 in
 the
 water,
 the
 amount
 of


fructose
 in
 the
 fruit
 is
 not
 leading
 to


such
 a
 big
 fructose
 spike.


>> There's
 a
 study
 on
 the
 G1D
 Foundation


that
 basically
 says
 for
 99%
 of


pregnancies,
 a
 strict
 ketogenic
 diet
 is


considered
 dangerous.
 doctors
 in
 instead


recommend
 a
 low
 glycemic
 index
 diet.


>> And
 low
 glycemic
 diets
 mean
 a
 diet
 with


smaller
 glucose
 spikes.
 And
 this
 is


really
 helpful
 for
 people
 with


gestational
 diabetes.
 It
 helps
 them


manage
 their
 spikes
 and
 reduce
 the
 need


for
 medication.
 But
 also
 for
 any


pregnant
 mom,
 it's
 important
 to
 think


about
 your
 glucose
 spikes
 because
 when


you
 have
 a
 glucose
 spike,
 your
 baby
 has


a
 glucose
 spike.
 And
 glucose
 spikes
 are


not
 good
 news.
 It's
 better
 to
 give
 your


baby
 slow
 rolling
 hills
 of
 glucose
 and


not
 these
 big
 spikes
 that
 can
 lead
 to


more
 inflammation.
 And
 as
 we
 talked


about,
 more
 inflammation
 can
 impact
 the


baby's
 brain
 development.


>> Do
 you
 recommend
 that
 mothers
 take


certain
 supplements?
 Did
 you
 take


supplements
 throughout
 your
 pregnancy?


>> Yeah,
 I
 took
 omega-3s.
 And
 the
 reason
 is


I
 took
 omega-3
 supplements
 is
 because


omega-3s
 also
 form
 the
 baby's
 brain
 and


they
 come
 from
 algae
 in
 the
 ocean
 and


fish.
 Now,
 omega-3s
 and
 in
 particular


one
 omega-3
 called
 DHA,
 it
 helps
 your


baby's
 neurons
 connect
 with
 each
 other.


And
 this
 is
 really
 important.
 And
 in


animal
 studies,
 when
 scientists
 restrict


how
 much
 DHA
 a
 mother
 has
 access
 to,


they
 see
 measurable
 impact
 on
 the
 baby's


brain.
 They
 see
 brains
 that
 are
 less


efficient.
 They
 see
 babies
 who
 find
 the


exit
 of
 mazes
 with
 much
 more
 time.


There's
 an
 impact
 on
 the
 brain


development.
 Now,
 the
 easiest
 way
 to
 get


enough
 DHA
 is
 to
 eat
 fish
 or
 to
 eat


sardines
 that
 we
 have
 here.
 So,
 the


recommendation
 is
 fatty
 fish
 twice
 a


week.
 I
 would
 say
 fatty
 fish
 three
 times


a
 week
 if
 you
 can.
 And
 this
 is
 also
 it's


amazing
 because
 it's
 very
 cheap.
 So,


these
 three
 cans
 of
 sardines
 are
 your


three
 servings
 of
 fish
 per
 week.
 This


gets
 gives
 you
 all
 the
 omega-3s
 your


baby
 needs.
 And
 this
 cost
 about
 in
 total


like
 $67.
 So,
 for
 $67
 per
 week
 and
 for


another
 $7
 of
 eggs
 per
 week,
 you're


getting
 all
 the
 choline
 and
 all
 the


omega-3s
 your
 baby
 needs.
 Yeah.
 You're


opening
 it.
 Are
 you
 going
 to
 eat
 it?


>> Okay.
 No.
 You
 want
 to
 know
 how
 I
 have


them?


>> How?


>> Okay.
 Are
 you
 going
 to
 eat
 it?


>> Yeah.


>> Go
 for
 it.
 So,
 I
 open
 the
 can.
 I
 put
 it


in
 a
 bowl.
 I
 put
 mustard
 in
 it.
 I
 put


sea
 salt,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 feta,


>> some
 herbs,
 and
 I
 make
 this
 sort
 of
 nice


little
 paste,
 and
 then
 I
 toast
 a
 piece


of
 bread,
 and
 I
 put
 it
 on
 top
 of
 the


bread,
 and
 I
 have
 like
 a
 nice
 little


sardine
 mash
 on
 my
 bread.


>> It
 is
 quite
 nice.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it's
 really
 good
 for
 you.
 Lots


of
 omega-3s.
 And
 so,
 for
 omega-3s,
 I


also
 supplemented
 with
 additional


omega-3s
 because
 I
 think
 the


recommendation
 of
 fatty
 fish
 two,
 three


times
 a
 day
 is
 lacking.
 Most
 moms
 don't


have
 enough
 omega-3s
 in
 their
 body
 to


give
 their
 baby
 everything
 that
 he


needs.
 So,
 I
 did
 this
 three
 times
 a
 week


plus
 two
 grams
 of
 DHA
 supplement
 per


day.


>> What
 else
 was
 in
 your
 supplement
 stack?


>> Then,
 uh,
 in
 the
 third
 trimester,
 I
 took


iron
 because
 my
 iron
 levels
 were
 very


low.
 This
 often
 happens
 during


pregnancy,
 even
 though
 I
 was
 eating
 a


lot
 of
 meat
 because
 your
 baby
 is
 pulling


a
 lot
 of
 iron
 from
 you.
 And
 then
 I
 had
 a


sort
 of
 normal
 prenatal
 supplement,
 but


I
 made
 sure
 it
 had
 choline
 in
 it.
 And
 I


made
 sure
 it
 had
 a
 type
 of
 folic
 acid


called
 metylated
 folate
 which
 is
 better


absorbed.
 And
 folate
 is
 very
 important


to
 prevent
 miscarriage.
 You
 talked
 about


your
 first
 pregnancy
 and
 you
 said
 we'll


talk
 about
 that
 later.


>> Mhm.


>> You
 went
 through
 miscarriage.


>> Yes.
 Correct.
 So
 I
 got
 pregnant
 the


first
 time
 and
 I
 thought
 everything


would
 be
 totally
 fine
 but
 I
 found
 out
 at


the
 3mon
 scan
 that
 the
 embryo
 had


stopped
 developing.
 I
 had
 what's
 called


a
 silent
 miscarriage.
 So,
 usually
 when


you
 miscarry,


you
 start
 to
 lose
 blood,
 you
 have


cramps,
 you
 know
 something's
 wrong.
 I


had
 a
 silent
 miscarriage,
 which
 is
 more


rare,
 meaning
 the
 embryo
 stopped


developing.
 The
 embryo
 was
 dead.
 My
 body


did
 not
 expulse
 it.
 So,
 I
 found
 out
 that


I
 had
 lost
 the
 pregnancy
 at
 the
 scan
 at


the
 doctor's
 office.
 And
 I
 found
 out


that
 I
 had
 been
 walking
 around
 for
 a


month
 with
 an
 embryo
 that
 had
 stopped


developing
 and
 I
 had
 no
 idea.
 I
 thought


I
 was
 still
 pregnant.


What
 What
 is
 What
 is
 that
 like
 for


someone
 like
 me
 that
 has
 never


experienced
 um
 such
 news?
 What
 are
 the


range
 of
 emotions
 and
 thoughts
 um
 that


occur
 when
 you
 get
 news
 like
 that?


>> Listen,
 for
 me
 it
 was
 so
 devastating.
 It


was
 so
 so
 difficult.
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't


want
 to
 believe
 it.
 I
 was
 screaming.
 I


remember
 like
 falling
 to
 the
 floor
 in
 my


living
 room
 and
 saying
 to
 whatever
 god


or
 the
 universe
 like
 that
 I
 wanted
 my


baby
 back.
 I
 was
 I
 was
 not
 okay.
 It
 was


very
 very
 difficult.
 Um
 I
 felt
 a
 lot
 of


anger.
 I
 felt
 a
 lot
 of
 despair.
 I
 felt
 a


sense
 of
 injustice
 like
 why
 me?
 I
 felt


like
 I
 had
 done
 everything
 right.
 Like
 I


was
 eating
 the
 choline.
 I
 was
 taking
 the


right
 supplements.
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 not


like
 smoking
 crack
 and
 I
 still
 had
 a


miscarriage
 and
 I
 I
 didn't
 know
 this


happened.
 I
 I
 didn't
 have
 it
 in
 my


consciousness
 that
 it
 could
 happen
 to


me.
 So,
 I
 felt
 from
 very
 very
 high.
 It


was
 it
 was
 probably
 one
 of
 the
 most


difficult
 experiences
 in
 my
 life.


>> Is
 this
 more
 common?


>> One
 in
 five
 pregnancies
 and
 in


miscarriage.


>> That's
 really
 high.
 Like
 way
 higher
 than


I
 thought
 it
 was.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 is
 it
 usually
 in
 the


>> in
 the
 first
 trimester?
 if
 I was
 still,


>> but
 it
 can
 happen
 later
 also.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 felt
 so
 isolated
 and
 I


didn't
 feel
 like
 people
 around
 me
 knew


how
 to
 how
 to
 handle
 it
 cuz
 it's
 kind
 of


taboo.
 And
 then
 when
 I
 miscarried,
 I


started
 talking
 to
 people
 about
 it.
 And


I
 found
 out
 that
 so
 many
 people
 around


me
 had
 gone
 through
 it
 but
 had
 never


told
 me
 about
 it.


>> When
 was
 your
 first
 pregnancy?


So,
 I
 got
 pregnant
 in
 February
 2024.


So,
 the
 miscarriage
 was
 in
 spring
 2024.


And
 then
 I
 got
 pregnant
 again


in
 August
 2025.


No,
 2024.
 And
 my
 son
 was
 born
 in
 May


2025.


So,
 I
 got
 pregnant
 quite
 quickly


afterwards.
 Um,
 but
 it
 was
 difficult


because
 I
 was
 still
 carrying
 the
 grief


of
 the
 miscarriage.
 So,
 I
 had
 a
 very


anxious
 pregnancy.
 I
 was
 very
 anxious


the
 whole
 time
 that
 something
 bad
 would


happen
 again,
 that
 I
 would
 miscarry


again
 and
 not
 know
 about
 it.
 It
 was
 very


difficult.


>> It's
 a
 trial
 of
 the
 heart,
 man.


>> It's
 Yeah,
 the
 numbers
 way
 higher
 than
 I


expected.
 Just
 just
 much
 higher
 than
 I


expected.
 And
 it's
 it's
 scary
 scary
 to


think
 about.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 that's
 why
 people
 usually
 wait
 until


the
 third
 month
 mark
 to
 tell
 their


friends
 and
 family
 that
 they're


pregnant.


>> And
 for
 some
 reason,
 I
 had
 no
 conception


of
 that.
 So
 the
 moment
 I
 got
 that
 first


pregnancy
 test,
 I
 told
 everybody.


>> Mhm.


>> So
 it
 made
 it
 quite
 complicated
 to
 have


to
 announce
 the
 miscarriage
 to
 like
 50


people.


>> Um
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 I
 felt
 less


alone
 than
 I
 would
 have
 felt
 if
 nobody


knew
 I
 was
 pregnant
 in
 the
 first
 place.


>> Mhm.


>> But
 yeah,
 it
 was
 very
 very
 challenging.


And
 it's
 more
 common
 than
 we
 think
 and


it
 happens
 to
 more
 people
 than
 we
 know


about.


>> Is
 there
 anything
 you
 wish
 you
 knew


earlier
 in
 life
 about
 I
 mean
 we've


talked
 about
 many
 of
 the
 things


specifically
 around
 diet
 and
 you
 know


and
 pregnancy
 but
 is
 there
 anything
 else


you
 wish
 someone
 had
 said
 to
 you
 as
 a


woman
 earlier


um
 that
 you
 didn't
 hear?


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 I
 wish
 I
 wish
 my
 mom
 had


told
 me
 about
 her
 miscarriages.
 She
 had


not.


>> Oh,
 really?


>> Until
 I
 miscarried.
 Yep.
 I
 wish
 my


grandmother
 had
 told
 me.
 I
 had
 I
 did
 not


know.
 I
 wish
 people
 had
 told
 me
 more


about
 their
 experiences
 because
 that
 way


I
 would
 have
 understood
 that
 it
 happens


to
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 Maybe
 I
 would
 have


been
 more
 prepared
 and
 maybe
 it
 would


have
 made
 the
 experience
 a
 little
 bit


less
 painful.


>> Mhm.


>> Instead
 of
 feeling
 so
 so
 isolated
 or
 at


least
 I
 would
 have
 maybe
 been
 a
 bit
 more


cautious


>> cuz
 you
 said
 one
 of
 the
 feelings
 and


emotions
 you
 had
 was
 why
 did
 this
 happen


to
 me?


>> Yes.
 I
 was
 like
 why
 me?
 Why
 me?
 And
 then


I
 realized
 it
 happens
 to
 many
 people
 and


it's
 not
 necessarily
 a
 reason.
 It's


nothing
 you've
 done.
 It
 can
 be
 just
 a


chromosomeal
 abnormality
 and
 the
 embryo


just
 can't
 develop
 anymore.
 It
 can
 be


something
 we
 don't
 understand
 yet.


>> It's
 hard,
 isn't
 it?
 Getting
 pregnant.


>> Yeah,


>> it's
 hard.
 I
 think
 I
 don't
 know
 what


lawyer
 I
 was
 living
 under,
 but
 I
 just


assumed
 that
 getting
 pregnant
 was
 have


sex
 unprotected.


>> I
 know.
 Because
 your
 whole
 life
 you're


told
 do
 all
 these
 things
 to
 not
 get


pregnant
 because
 it
 might
 happen
 without


you
 expecting
 it.
 And
 then
 when
 you
 try


to
 get
 pregnant,
 you
 realize,
 oh,
 it's


not
 at
 all
 as
 easy
 as
 I
 thought
 it
 was.


>> It's
 it's
 it's
 a
 lot.
 And
 I
 was
 lucky
 I


got
 pregnant
 after,
 you
 know,
 two
 three


cycles
 both
 times.
 So
 that's
 very
 very


quick.
 But
 some
 of
 my
 friends,
 it's


taken
 them
 years
 to
 conceive.


>> How
 has
 becoming
 a
 mother
 changed
 you?


>> Um,
 it's
 made
 me
 happier.
 I
 feel
 like
 my


baseline
 happiness
 is
 higher.
 I
 don't


have
 I
 used
 to
 have
 this
 like
 10%
 kind


of
 melancholy
 or
 or
 spleen
 or
 sort
 of


like
 oh
 maybe
 my
 life
 could
 be
 better
 if


I
 did
 X
 or
 Y
 or
 like
 questioning
 you


know
 do
 I
 need
 more
 how
 do
 I
 how
 do
 I


find
 happiness
 and
 that's
 gone
 like
 with


my
 son
 that
 has
 that
 has
 been
 filled
 and


I
 didn't
 expect
 it
 to
 be
 filled
 so


that's
 been
 amazing
 and
 it's
 made
 me


very
 efficient
 because
 now
 when
 I
 have


42
 minutes
 I
 use
 this
 42
 minutes
 like
 I


cannot
 imagine
 Imagine
 how
 much
 time
 I


used
 to
 have.
 Like,
 what
 did
 I
 used
 to


do?
 And
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 busy.
 Now
 I'm


really
 busy.
 It's
 so
 funny
 to
 look
 back


at
 my
 life
 before
 and
 what
 I
 used
 to


think
 and
 realize
 that
 I
 was
 completely


wrong.
 I
 was
 so
 wrong.
 I
 thought
 I
 was


busy
 and
 I
 thought
 I
 was
 tired.


I
 wasn't.
 Now
 I
 am.


>> You
 feel
 very
 busy,
 right?


>> I
 feel
 so
 busy.


>> And
 you
 feel
 tired.


>> I
 do.
 I
 do
 sometimes
 ask
 myself,
 you


know,
 because
 again,
 I'm
 in
 that
 season


of
 life.
 I
 do
 like
 where
 am
 I
 going to


get
 the
 where's
 the
 time
 going
 to
 come


from
 cuz
 like


>> you
 just
 prioritize
 so
 many
 things
 you


just
 delegate
 or
 you
 don't
 do
 anymore


>> and
 you
 find
 the
 time
 cuz
 your
 baby
 is


the
 most
 important
 thing


>> and
 I
 I
 think
 I've
 become
 better
 at
 my


work
 because
 I'm
 more
 efficient
 and
 I


thought
 I
 was
 pretty
 efficient
 before


but
 now
 I'm
 like
 super
 human.
 On
 that


point
 of
 parenting
 and
 pregnancy
 and


everything
 we've
 been
 talking
 about,
 you


said
 that
 you
 spoke
 to
 your
 mother
 about


the
 diet
 she
 had
 and
 her
 lifestyle
 when


she
 was
 growing
 you
 inside
 her.
 Uh,
 if


your
 parents
 did
 have
 a
 suboptimal


lifestyle
 in
 diet,


>> this
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 strange
 question
 to


ask,
 but
 is
 there
 something
 that
 I
 can


do
 now
 as
 an
 adult
 to
 reverse
 that?


>> Totally.
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 my
 mom
 was


eating
 a
 lot
 of
 sugar,
 but
 it
 wasn't
 her


fault.
 Like,
 culture
 around
 her
 was


telling
 her
 fat
 is
 bad.
 Eat
 low-fat


foods.
 Like,
 she
 was
 just
 a
 product
 of


her
 time,
 like
 we
 all
 are.
 So,
 our
 diet


today
 is
 just
 a
 function
 of
 what
 food


marketing
 is
 going
 on.
 So,
 again,
 it's


not
 our
 fault.
 We're
 just
 kind
 of


swimming
 in
 this
 sea
 of
 the
 food


industry
 and
 marketing
 and
 we
 do
 the


best
 we
 can.


Pregnancy
 is
 important.
 It
 has
 an


outsized
 effect
 on
 our
 vulnerability
 to


disease,
 but
 it's
 not
 everything.
 So,
 I


told
 you
 at
 25
 I
 was
 on
 the
 cusp
 of


pre-diabetes.
 Well,
 I
 implemented
 the


glucose
 hacks.
 I
 found
 all
 the
 science


and
 I
 never
 got
 pre-diabetes.
 So,
 you're


probably
 going
 to
 be
 fine.
 It's
 more
 of


the
 difference
 between
 like,
 so
 I
 have


two
 friends.
 I
 have
 Gabriel
 and
 Nicholas


and
 they
 both
 work
 out
 the
 same
 and
 eat


the
 same.
 One
 of
 them
 builds
 muscle


really
 easily
 and
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 muscle


mass.
 The
 other
 one
 doesn't.
 They're
 not


equal.
 However,
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that


they
 both
 can't
 build
 muscle.
 It
 might


just
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 difficult
 for


one
 than
 for
 the
 other.
 Same
 thing
 with


diabetes.
 One
 person
 may
 get
 diabetes


with
 the
 same
 diet
 as
 another
 person
 who


doesn't
 get
 it.
 Well,
 when
 you
 apply


things,
 when
 you
 change
 your
 diet,
 you


can
 change
 the
 course
 of
 your
 life.
 You


can
 change
 what
 diseases
 you
 you
 face.


But
 you
 might
 be
 more
 or
 less


vulnerable.
 So,
 we
 always
 have
 agency.


We
 always
 have
 power,
 no matter
 our
 age,


no
 matter
 where
 we
 are
 in
 life,
 to
 take


back
 control.


>> Cravings.


>> Mhm.


>> Cravings
 are
 where
 it
 all
 begins.
 You


know,
 you
 can
 know
 everything.


>> Wait,
 say
 more
 about
 that.
 What
 do
 you


mean?


>> Like
 you
 can
 know,
 you
 can
 have
 all
 the


information.
 I'm
 sure
 that
 there's


people
 that
 listen
 to
 this
 podcast,


including
 me,
 who
 know
 a
 lot
 about
 this


stuff,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 mean


that
 you
 have
 the
 control
 to
 take


action.
 Because
 when
 your
 brain
 starts


saying,
 "Go
 on,
 eat
 that
 thing.
 Go
 on.


It'll
 be
 so
 tasty."
 And
 you
 know what?


You
 can
 do
 your
 calf
 raises
 after
 it.


It'll
 be
 fine.
 Like
 that
 voice
 in
 your


head
 that
 talks
 you
 into
 things
 that
 you


don't
 really
 want
 to
 do,
 and
 then
 10


minutes
 later,
 you
 feel
 really
 guilty


that
 you
 did
 it.
 M


>> I'm
 just
 wondering
 if
 you
 think
 much


about
 the
 psychology
 of
 being
 in
 the


things
 I
 can
 do
 upstream
 to
 either
 fend


off
 the
 cravings
 or
 to
 have
 better


agency
 and
 control
 over
 the
 cravings.


>> So
 let's
 talk
 about
 that
 voice
 because


that
 voice
 comes
 in
 two
 flavors.


For
 some
 the
 voice
 is
 m
 that
 cookie


looks
 really
 really
 good.
 Chocolate
 chip


with
 sea
 salt
 that
 looks
 tasty.
 I'm


going
 to
 probably
 buy
 it
 after
 the
 end


of
 this
 meeting.
 That
 is
 the
 voice
 of


pleasure
 and
 enjoyment.
 There's
 another


voice
 that
 might
 be
 in
 your
 brain
 which


is
 like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 I
 need
 sugar
 right


now.
 What's
 in
 the
 kitchen?
 I'm
 going
 to


open
 the
 cupboards.
 Whatever
 there
 is.


Oh,
 this
 weird
 old
 cookie.
 I
 need
 to


have
 it
 right
 now.
 I
 need
 sugar


otherwise
 I'm
 not
 going to
 feel
 good."


Those
 are
 two
 very
 different
 voices.


That
 second
 voice
 is
 a
 voice
 of
 control


and
 of
 almost
 being
 like
 a
 victim
 to


sugar
 addiction.
 I
 want
 to
 help
 people


go
 from
 the
 sugar
 addiction
 voice
 to
 the


enjoyment
 voice
 because
 I
 think
 it's


fine
 to
 have
 cravings
 of
 or
 to
 want
 to


eat
 something
 delicious.
 I
 just
 want
 to


make
 sure
 people
 are
 not
 controlled
 by


that
 voice.
 Do
 you
 see
 what
 I
 mean?
 I


want
 it
 to
 be
 something
 you
 enjoy,
 not


something
 you
 are
 victim
 to.
 So,
 how
 do


we
 separate
 these
 two
 things
 out?


>> We
 need
 to
 balance
 our
 glucose
 levels
 so


that
 that
 voice
 comes
 from
 a
 place
 of


happiness
 and
 not
 a
 place
 of
 a
 glucose


crash
 that
 is
 making
 you
 feel
 controlled


by
 a
 biological
 impulse
 that
 is
 stronger


than
 you.
 So,
 protein
 in
 the
 morning,
 a


savory
 breakfast,
 super
 super
 important.


Then,
 a
 veggie
 starter
 before
 your
 lunch


and
 your
 dinner
 when
 you
 can.
 avoiding


sugar
 on
 an
 empty
 stomach
 to
 not
 kick


off
 a
 roller
 coaster
 of
 blood
 sugar
 ups


and
 downs
 that's
 going
 to
 make
 you
 crave


more
 and
 more
 of
 this
 of
 this
 sweet


stuff.
 But
 the
 voice
 that
 you
 just


mentioned,
 which
 is
 like,
 "Oh,
 that


looks
 really
 good.
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 some


calf
 raises
 afterwards."
 I
 think
 that's


fine.
 To
 me,
 that
 doesn't
 sound
 like


you're
 being
 controlled
 by
 it.
 It
 sounds


like
 you
 kind
 of
 want
 to
 eat
 delicious


stuff,


>> but
 I
 regret
 it
 10
 minutes
 after.
 And
 I


go,
 "Why?"
 Because
 I
 think,


>> you
 know,
 especially
 if
 it's
 at
 like
 10


p.m.


>> Yeah.
 Because
 then
 it
 messes
 up
 your


sleep.
 It
 messes
 up
 my
 next
 day.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 know.
 Why
 the
 hell
 did
 I
 do
 that?
 I


knew
 I
 shouldn't
 eat
 it.
 Yeah.


>> But
 the
 craving
 was
 too
 strong.


>> And
 listen,
 sometimes
 that's
 the


situation
 we're
 in.
 I
 do
 that
 too


sometimes.
 Like
 sometimes
 it
 is
 11:00


p.m.
 I'm
 exhausted.
 I
 know
 my
 son's


probably
 going
 to
 wake
 up
 at
 4:00
 a.m.,


>> but
 I
 want
 that
 cookie.
 And
 I
 just
 I


just
 have
 it.
 Maybe
 I
 have
 some
 vinegar


or
 some
 antispect
 before,
 but
 it's
 okay


to
 give
 into
 these
 things.
 I
 don't
 think


we
 have
 to
 feel
 guilty
 about
 them.
 Like,


that's
 just
 life.
 Sometimes
 we
 can't
 do


the
 glucose
 hacks
 and
 sometimes
 we're


tired
 and
 the
 cookie
 looks
 good,
 so
 eat


the
 cookie.
 But
 it
 annoys
 me
 because
 I


then
 feel
 the
 next
 day
 and
 I
 go,


"Well,
 you
 know,


>> was
 it
 worth
 it?"
 Absolutely
 not.


Objectively,
 absolutely
 not.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 maybe
 if
 you
 had
 had
 that


cookie
 after
 some
 almonds
 or
 if
 after


the
 cookie
 you
 could
 do
 some
 laundry
 or


move
 around
 a
 little
 bit
 to
 reduce
 the


spike,
 maybe
 you
 could
 help
 with
 your


deep
 sleep
 during
 that
 night,


>> but
 sometimes
 you
 can't.


>> I
 think
 as
 well
 the
 subject
 of
 sleep
 and


glucose
 is
 one
 we
 we
 don't
 talk
 about


enough
 because
 some
 people
 really


struggle
 with
 their
 sleep.
 Yeah.


>> I'm
 flying,
 I'm
 waking
 up
 early
 at
 4


a.m.,
 fly,
 fly,
 go
 to,
 wherever,


>> my
 ability
 to
 control


>> cravings
 is
 significantly
 reduced.
 And


weirdly,
 I
 noticed
 that
 when
 I
 wake
 up


at
 say
 I
 I
 had,
 I
 don't
 know,
 I
 had


dinner
 at
 9:00
 p.m.
 the
 night
 before,
 if


I'm
 woken
 up
 at
 like
 3:00
 or
 4:00
 a.m.,


I
 wake
 up
 really
 hungry.


>> Interesting.
 Have
 you
 worn
 a
 glucose


monitor
 to
 see
 if
 you're
 not
 crashing
 in


the
 middle
 of
 the
 night?


>> No.
 But
 I've
 I've
 always
 been
 so
 curious


as
 to
 why
 that
 is.
 Because
 I
 know
 that


if
 id
 slept
 for
 4
 hours
 more,
 I
 would


have
 been
 like
 today
 where
 the
 first


thing
 I've
 eaten
 today
 and
 it's
 what
 2


p.m.
 is
 that
 sardine


>> because
 I
 just
 wasn't
 hungry
 this


morning.


>> But
 if
 I'd
 woken
 up
 early,
 I
 mean,
 I've


looked
 a
 little
 bit
 into


>> I
 have
 a
 question.
 Do
 you
 think
 it's
 the


time
 you
 wake
 up
 that
 is
 causing
 you
 to


be
 more
 or
 less
 hungry?
 Or
 it's
 the


dinner
 you
 had
 the
 night
 before
 that
 is


causing
 a
 crash
 that
 is
 causing
 you
 to


wake
 up?


>> Like
 what's
 the
 chicken,
 what's
 the
 egg?


Because
 it
 sounds
 to
 me
 like
 maybe
 at


3:00
 a.m.
 if
 you're
 having
 a
 glucose


crash
 because
 you
 had
 a
 big
 carb
 heavy


dinner.
 Then
 it's
 your
 body
 waking
 you


up
 and
 making
 you
 feel
 very
 hungry.
 For


me,
 it's
 kind
 of
 similar
 like
 in
 the


morning
 if
 I
 feel
 extremely
 hungry,
 it's


usually
 because
 I
 went
 to
 bed
 and
 I
 had


just
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 carbs
 before
 bed.


Well,
 thanks
 to
 the
 ability
 to
 do
 very


quick
 research,
 I
 now
 know
 the
 answer,


or
 at least
 a
 solid
 hypothesis,
 and
 the


leading
 answer
 as
 to
 why
 when
 you're


sleep
 deprived,
 you
 end
 up
 eating
 worse


is
 because
 of
 the
 hormone
 imbalance
 of


leptin
 and
 grein.


>> Sleep
 deprivation
 directly
 alters
 the


hunger
 hormones
 produced
 in
 your
 gut
 and


fat
 cells.


>> If
 grein
 increases,
 known
 as
 hung,


ghrein
 signals
 the
 brain
 that
 it's
 time


to
 eat.
 Studies
 from
 Stanford
 University


showing
 for
 only
 5
 hours
 increases
 grein


by
 approximately
 15%.
 Leptin
 decreases.


Um
 the
 satiety
 hormone
 tells
 your
 brain


you
 are
 full.
 The
 same
 sleep
 loss


decreases
 leptin
 by
 approximately
 15%.


And
 therefore
 the
 result
 is
 that
 your


brain
 receives
 a
 loud
 I
 am
 starving


signal
 and
 a
 very
 weak
 I'm
 full
 signal


simultaneously.


>> And
 leptin
 is
 the
 hormone
 we
 talked


about
 at
 the
 beginning
 which
 when
 you're


breastfed
 as
 a
 baby,
 you're


epigenetically
 making
 more
 leptin.
 And


this
 setting
 can
 stay
 with
 you
 for
 life.


So,
 it's
 possible
 that
 also
 there's
 some


stuff
 going
 on
 in
 early
 life
 that
 makes


you
 more
 or
 less
 hungry.


>> To
 speak
 to
 my
 mom,


>> you
 know,
 every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 you
 come


across
 a
 product
 that
 has
 such
 a
 huge


impact
 on
 your
 life
 that
 you'd
 probably


describe
 as
 a
 gamecher.
 And
 I
 would
 say


for
 about
 35
 to
 40%
 of
 my
 team,
 they


would
 currently
 describe
 this
 product


that
 I
 have
 in
 front
 of
 me
 called
 Ketone


IQ,
 which
 you
 can
 get
 at
 ketone.com


as
 a
 game
 changer.
 But
 the
 reason
 I


became
 a
 coowner
 of
 this
 company
 and
 the


reason
 why
 they
 they
 now
 are
 a
 sponsor


of
 this
 podcast
 is
 because
 one
 day
 when


I
 came
 to
 work,
 there
 was
 a
 box
 of
 this


stuff
 sat
 on
 my
 desk.
 I
 had
 no
 idea
 what


it
 was.
 Lily
 in
 my
 team
 says
 that
 this


company
 have
 been
 in
 touch.
 So
 I
 went


upstairs,
 tried
 it,
 and
 quite
 frankly,


the
 rest
 is
 history.
 in
 terms
 of
 my


focus,
 my
 energy
 levels,
 how
 I
 feel,
 how


I
 work,
 how
 productive
 I
 am.
 Game


changer.

For
 the
 first
 10
 years
 that
 I
 was
 a


founder,
 I
 didn't
 prioritize
 getting
 a


good
 night's
 sleep
 at
 all.
 But
 over


time,
 I
 started
 to
 realize
 that
 it
 was


the
 key
 metric
 that
 influenced


everything
 in
 my
 life.
 My
 mood,
 my


focus,
 my
 ability
 to
 show
 up
 and
 to


think
 clearly
 and
 to
 lead
 well.
 So
 now


with
 my
 lifestyle
 being
 pretty
 crazy,


traveling
 across
 time
 zones,
 working


late,
 training
 late,
 I
 still
 fight
 to


protect
 my
 sleep,
 which
 sometimes
 means


starting
 the
 day
 a
 little
 bit
 later.
 It


was
 my
 Whoop
 that
 helped
 me
 to
 make
 this


connection.
 They
 are
 one
 of
 my
 sponsors


for
 the
 show,
 and
 for
 the
 last
 four


years,
 every
 day,
 my
 Whoop
 has
 given
 me


insights
 into
 my
 sleep,
 my
 recovery,
 the


strain
 I'm
 taking
 on,
 and
 more
 broadly,


how
 my
 daily
 behaviors
 influence
 my


overall
 holistic
 health.
 It's
 the


difference
 between
 guessing
 and
 knowing


why
 I
 might
 be
 feeling
 the
 way
 that
 I


feel.
 Sometimes
 it
 will
 nudge
 me.


Sometimes
 it
 will
 get
 me
 to
 slow
 down.


Sometimes
 it
 pushes
 me
 to
 go
 even


harder,
 but
 all
 the
 time
 it
 provides
 me


with
 data
 that
 gives
 me
 a
 deeper


understanding
 of
 myself.
 And
 without
 it,


it'd
 be
 hard
 to
 optimize
 how
 I
 live
 and


perform.

Make
 sure
 you
 keep
 what
 I'm
 about
 to
 say


to
 yourself.
 I'm
 inviting
 10,000
 of
 you


to
 come
 even
 deeper
 into
 the
 diary
 of
 a


CEO.
 Welcome
 to
 my
 inner
 circle.
 This
 is


a
 brand
 new
 private
 community
 that
 I'm


launching
 to
 the
 world.
 We
 have
 so
 many


incredible
 things
 that
 happen
 that
 you


are
 never
 shown.
 We
 have
 the
 briefs
 that


are
 on
 my
 iPad
 when
 I'm
 recording
 the


conversation.
 We
 have
 clips
 we've
 never


released.
 We
 have
 behindthe-scenes


conversations
 with
 the
 guests
 and
 also


the
 episodes
 that
 we've
 never
 ever


released.
 and
 so
 much
 more.
 In
 the


circle,
 you'll
 have
 direct
 access
 to
 me.


You
 can
 tell
 us
 what
 you
 want
 this
 show


to
 be,
 who
 you
 want
 us
 to
 interview,
 and


the
 types
 of
 conversations
 you
 would


love
 us
 to
 have.
 But
 remember,
 for
 now,


we're
 only
 inviting
 the
 first
 10,000


people
 that
 join
 before
 it
 closes.
 So,


if
 you
 want
 to
 join
 our
 private
 closed


community,
 head
 to
 the
 link
 in
 the


description
 below
 or
 go
 to


daccircle.com.


I
 will
 speak
 to
 you
 then.


What
 is
 the
 the
 most
 important
 thing
 we


haven't
 talked
 about
 as
 it
 relates
 to


nine
 months
 that
 count
 forever,
 your
 new


book,
 that
 we
 should
 have
 talked
 about?


>> I
 think
 protein.


>> Protein.


>> Yeah.
 By
 the
 time
 your
 baby's
 born,
 he


is
 about
 50%
 protein
 if
 you
 exclude


water.
 So
 protein
 is
 not
 just
 for
 your


muscles.
 Protein
 forms
 your
 immune


system,
 your
 skin,
 your
 organs,
 many


many
 tissues,
 many
 many
 signaling


molecules
 in
 your
 body.
 So
 when
 you're


pregnant,
 you
 need
 to
 eat
 more
 protein


to
 give
 more
 protein
 to
 your
 baby.
 And


animal
 studies
 show
 something


fascinating,
 Stephen.
 They
 show
 that


when
 a
 mom
 is
 slightly
 protein


restricted,
 meaning
 she's
 eating
 a
 bit


less
 protein
 than
 she
 needs
 to,
 there's


a
 little
 epigenetic
 switch
 happening
 in


the
 baby
 that
 says,
 "Dear
 baby,
 keep


your
 muscles
 small
 because
 there's
 not
 a


lot
 of
 protein
 in
 the
 world
 you're
 about


to
 be
 born
 into."
 So
 what
 we're
 eating


during
 pregnancy
 is
 in
 essence
 sending
 a


little
 postcard
 to
 our
 baby
 in
 our


uterus
 telling
 him
 what
 kind
 of


nutrients
 will
 be
 available
 in
 the
 world


that
 he's
 about
 to
 be
 born
 into.
 And
 so


these
 animal
 studies
 suggest
 that
 if
 you


have
 a
 low
 protein
 diet,
 your
 baby
 will


be
 programmed
 to
 stay
 smaller
 and
 have


smaller
 muscle
 mass
 throughout
 his
 life.


And
 the
 thing
 is,
 Stephen,
 you
 need
 a


lot
 of
 protein
 when
 you're
 pregnant


because
 your
 baby
 is
 very
 protein


hungry.
 So
 here
 I
 have
 four
 chicken


breasts,
 which
 is
 basically
 the
 amount


of
 protein
 that
 I
 needed
 to
 eat
 every


single
 day.


>> Day


>> in
 the
 third
 trimester
 of
 pregnancy.


>> Yeah.
 Day.


>> Yeah.
 Per
 day.


>> Per
 day.
 It's
 a
 lot.


>> So
 I
 would
 have
 four
 eggs
 in
 the


morning.
 That's
 about
 30
 grams
 of


protein.
 And
 then
 I
 would
 have
 to
 have


three
 good
 servings
 of
 protein


represented
 by
 the
 three
 chicken
 breasts


here.
 So
 I
 would
 have
 fish
 at
 lunch,


probably
 a
 meat
 or
 a
 chicken
 at
 dinner,


and
 then
 a
 high
 protein
 snack.
 For


example,
 Greek
 yogurt.
 I
 would
 add
 some


whey
 protein
 powder
 in
 there
 to
 make


sure
 I
 was
 having
 enough
 protein.
 So,


you
 need
 about
 1.6
 gram
 of
 protein
 per


kilo
 of
 body
 weight
 per
 day
 in
 the
 third


trimester
 of
 pregnancy.
 And
 this
 is


where
 most
 of
 us
 fall
 short
 because


nobody's
 telling
 moms
 they
 need
 to
 eat


more
 protein.
 So,
 the
 result
 is
 that


moms
 lose
 their
 muscle
 mass
 because
 the


muscles
 are
 being
 broken
 down
 to
 give


protein
 to
 the
 baby.
 But
 there's
 a
 limit


to
 it.
 like
 you
 can't
 your
 muscle
 mass


cannot
 compensate
 for
 a
 low
 protein


diet.
 And
 this
 is
 why
 we
 see
 across
 all


women,
 all
 studies,
 low
 protein
 diets


lead
 to
 smaller
 babies
 and
 potentially


this
 epigenetic
 programming
 of
 staying


smaller
 throughout
 life.
 So
 protein
 is


key.


>> On
 that
 subject
 of
 muscle
 loss,
 have
 you


thought
 much
 about
 the
 impact
 of
 GLP1s,


these
 sort
 of
 fat
 loss
 drugs
 during


pregnancy?


>> Oh
 wow.
 I
 don't
 think
 they're


recommended
 during
 pregnancy.
 I
 hope
 not


because
 they
 prevent
 you
 from
 feeling


your
 hunger
 hormones.
 They
 prevent
 you


from
 feeling
 hungry.
 So,
 pregnancy
 would


be
 a
 very
 dangerous
 time
 to
 take
 these


because
 during
 pregnancy,
 you
 need
 to


eat
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 in
 terms
 of


quantity
 and
 calories,
 but
 also
 you
 need


to
 eat
 differently.
 So,
 you
 need
 to


learn
 about
 the
 protein,
 the
 choline,


the
 omega-3s,
 and
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 quite


dangerous
 to
 take
 a
 GLP1
 during


pregnancy.


Do
 you
 do
 you
 know
 that
 the
 vinegar


thing
 you
 talked
 about
 to
 me
 before


where
 you
 said
 you
 have
 vinegar
 before


eating
 something
 that's
 high
 in
 glucose?


>> Yeah.


>> Do
 you
 recommend
 that
 for
 mothers
 as


well?


>> You
 can,
 but
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 that,


you
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 the
 vinegar
 is


pasteurized
 because
 you
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 during
 pregnancy
 people
 are


like
 only
 eat
 pasteurized
 foods
 because


you
 want
 to
 prevent
 any
 food


contamination.
 So
 make
 sure
 you
 look
 on


the
 back
 of
 the
 vinegar
 bottle
 and
 make


sure
 it's
 pasteurized.
 Apple
 cider


vinegar
 is
 usually
 not
 pasteurized.
 So,


do
 I
 recommend
 it?


I
 think
 it's
 okay
 to
 do.
 Like,
 vinegar


is
 fine
 during
 pregnancy,
 especially
 if


you
 really
 want
 like
 a
 cookie
 or
 a


muffin.
 It
 could
 be
 helpful
 to
 reduce


the
 glucose
 spike.
 But
 truly,
 pregnancy


is
 kind
 of
 the
 moment
 where
 you
 need
 to


be
 eating
 as
 little
 sugar
 as
 possible


because
 it's
 impacting
 your
 baby's


development.
 So,
 ideally,


you
 don't
 have
 to
 use
 the
 vinegar
 hack.


You
 know,
 I've
 often
 seen
 people
 talk


about
 like
 an
 obesity
 gene
 and
 stuff
 and


ask
 if
 obesity
 is
 genetic.


>> I
 guess
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I've
 kind
 of


deduced
 from
 today
 is
 that
 the
 genetic


component
 might
 be
 that
 during
 pregnancy


our
 mother
 um
 had
 a
 certain
 lifestyle
 or


diet
 and
 that
 increased
 our


predisposition


to
 having
 a
 different
 reaction
 to


certain
 foods


>> completely
 and
 the
 studies
 show
 that.
 So


in
 animal
 studies,
 when
 a
 mom
 has
 a
 lot


of
 sugar
 during
 pregnancy,
 there's


little
 epigenetic
 switches
 in
 the
 baby's


DNA
 that
 encourage
 fat
 storage.


>> Oh,
 okay.


>> So
 why
 is
 that?
 Because
 if
 you
 eat


sugar,
 your
 baby's
 getting
 sugar
 in
 his


bloodstream.
 And
 how
 does
 the
 baby


protect
 himself
 from
 high
 sugar
 levels?


By
 turning
 the
 sugar
 into
 fat.
 So
 by


eating
 a
 high
 sugar
 diet,
 you're
 sending


a
 little
 postcard
 to
 your
 baby
 being


like,
 "Hey
 baby,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 born


into
 a
 world
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 sugar.
 So


become
 really
 good
 at
 turning
 that
 sugar


into
 fat
 to
 protect
 yourself.
 And
 this


is
 why
 we
 see
 across
 studies
 on
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 moms
 that
 the
 higher
 a


mom's
 glucose
 levels
 during
 pregnancy,


the
 more
 fat
 mass
 a
 baby
 is
 born
 with.


>> Higher
 glucose
 during
 pregnancy,
 baby


had
 to
 turn
 that
 glucose
 into
 fat
 to


protect
 himself.
 So
 he's
 born
 with
 more


fat
 mass.
 And
 it
 doesn't
 just
 stop
 after


birth.
 Studies
 show
 that
 this
 continues.


Babies
 born
 to
 high
 glucose
 mothers
 are


more
 likely
 to
 have
 obesity
 as
 children,


as
 teenagers,
 and
 as
 adults.
 So,
 the


cycle
 continues.
 The
 programming
 of


storing
 a
 lot
 of
 fat
 continues
 even


though
 they're
 no
 longer
 connected
 to


their
 mom's
 bloodstream.


>> In
 the
 process
 of
 producing
 this
 book,


did
 did
 you
 think
 much
 about
 the


evolutionary
 sort
 of
 backstory
 of
 where


we
 came
 from
 and
 how
 our
 ancestors
 used


to
 eat?
 Did
 you


>> consider,
 I
 don't know,
 the
 orangutang


where
 we
 share
 most
 of
 our
 DNA?
 I
 think


it's
 like
 98%
 of
 our
 DNA


>> because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 sort
 of
 what
 we


used
 to
 eat,
 meaning
 nutrient-rich
 organ


meats
 and
 not
 just
 like
 a
 chicken


breast,
 which
 is
 just
 muscle,
 which
 is


actually
 very
 poor
 nutrients.
 If
 you


think
 about
 how
 we
 didn't
 used
 to
 eat


processed
 foods,
 we
 had
 a
 diet
 that
 was


much
 more
 conducive
 to
 baby
 having
 more


of
 what
 he
 needed
 in
 the
 womb.
 Today,


our
 food
 system
 is
 failing
 us.
 We're
 all


deprived
 of
 proper
 nutrition
 with
 what


we're
 eating
 with
 all
 these


ultrarocessed
 foods,
 and
 that
 includes


pregnant
 moms.
 So,
 I
 tried
 to
 write
 a


book
 that
 was
 going
 to
 help
 people


navigate
 this
 very
 toxic
 food
 landscape


to
 see
 these
 four
 simple
 things
 they


could
 do
 to
 try
 to
 optimize
 a
 little
 bit


what
 the
 baby
 was
 getting.
 But
 it's
 a


lot
 to
 think
 about.
 And
 also
 being


pregnant
 comes
 with,
 I
 think,
 innate


pressure.
 Like
 I
 felt
 pressure
 during


pregnancy.
 I'm
 like,
 man,
 I'm
 making


another
 human.
 Like,
 this
 is
 a
 lot.
 And


then
 you're
 bombarded
 by
 messages
 online


and
 Instagram
 what
 to
 do,
 what
 not
 to


do.
 And
 it
 feels
 like
 whatever
 you
 do,


you
 feel
 guilty.


>> Mhm.
 So,
 I'm
 hoping
 this
 book
 gives


clear
 science,
 scientific
 evidence
 to


help
 people
 navigate
 that
 pressure.
 But


listen,
 I
 just
 want
 babies
 to
 be


healthy.
 Like,
 I
 want
 my
 baby
 to
 be


healthy.
 I
 want
 everybody's
 baby
 to
 be


healthy.
 I
 want
 moms
 to
 feel
 as
 little


stress
 as
 possible.
 And
 that's
 just
 the


truth.
 So,
 I'm
 hoping
 that
 this
 book


brings
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 reassurance
 and


light
 in
 this
 complicated
 world
 we
 live


in.


Stress
 is
 something
 we
 haven't
 talked


about,
 but
 I
 guess
 that
 also
 is
 an


important
 factor
 in
 this
 the
 story
 of


raising
 a
 healthy
 child.


>> I
 was
 extremely
 stressed
 my
 entire


pregnancy
 because
 of
 my
 miscarriage.


Like
 I
 probably
 the
 nine
 months
 of
 my


pregnancy
 with
 my
 son
 were
 the
 nine
 most


anxious
 months
 of
 my
 life.
 And
 that's


probably
 not
 very
 good
 for
 my
 baby.
 But


hey,
 you
 do
 what
 you
 can,
 you
 know?
 I
 I


tried
 everything
 to
 reduce
 my
 stress


levels.
 I
 just
 couldn't.
 I
 was
 so


nervous
 about
 losing
 the
 pregnancy.


>> You
 tried
 everything?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 everything.
 I
 didn't
 take


anxiety
 medication,
 but
 I
 was,
 you
 know,


doing
 yoga
 and
 breath
 work
 and
 working


out
 and
 talking
 to
 my
 therapist
 and
 blah


blah
 blah,
 but
 I
 was
 still
 anxious


because
 I
 really
 didn't
 want
 to
 lose
 the


pregnancy
 and
 I
 was
 scared
 I
 would.


Why
 are
 you
 smiling?


>> But
 you
 didn't.
 No,
 I
 didn't.


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 have
 a
 happy,
 healthy


>> Yeah.


>> little
 baby.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 want
 to
 have
 more
 babies?


>> I
 would
 love
 to,
 but
 man,
 now
 it's
 like


logistics.
 It's
 like,
 okay,
 so
 I'm
 doing


this
 project
 and
 that
 project
 and
 this


work
 thing.
 So,
 where
 can
 I
 find
 nine


months
 plus
 6
 months
 where
 I
 can't


really
 work


>> in
 in
 this
 crazy
 schedule
 that
 I
 create


for
 myself.
 By
 the
 way,
 I'm
 I'm
 I
 just


love
 my
 work.
 So,
 I'm
 always
 planning


new
 things.


>> When
 you
 look
 at
 products
 in
 the


supermarket,


>> I
 think
 we
 all
 have
 a
 different
 thing
 we


go
 straight
 to
 on
 the
 label.
 Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 sometimes
 people
 go
 to


calories,
 sometimes
 they
 look
 at


protein,
 sometimes
 they're
 looking
 at
 is


it
 gluten-free,
 sometimes
 they
 look
 at


the
 carbohydrates
 or
 the
 sugars.
 What
 do


you
 look
 for?


>> Ingredients.
 I
 go
 straight
 to
 the


ingredients
 list.
 Yeah,
 because
 in
 the


ingredients
 list,
 things
 are
 ordered
 by


weight.
 So,
 the
 first
 ingredient
 is


going
 to
 be
 what
 there
 is
 the
 most
 of
 in


that
 food.


>> Oh,
 I
 had
 no
 idea.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 they're
 ordered
 by
 weight.
 So,


if
 there
 is
 sugar
 or
 any
 other
 type
 of


sweet
 thing
 in
 the
 first
 five


ingredients,
 like
 dates,
 like
 fruit


juice,
 like
 molluses,
 like
 uh
 orange


syrup,
 whatever.
 I
 know
 that's
 a


dessert.
 And
 so
 I
 put
 it
 in
 my
 mind,


okay,
 this
 is
 a
 food
 for
 enjoyment
 for


dessert.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 sardines


ingredients,
 sardine,
 olive
 oil,
 salt,


natural
 flavor.
 So
 I
 would
 try
 to
 look


for
 one
 that
 doesn't
 have
 natural
 flavor


cuz
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 that
 means.
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 necessary.
 But
 as
 you


can
 see,
 there's
 no
 sugar
 in
 here.
 So


this
 is
 not
 dessert.
 This
 sardine
 can
 is


not
 dessert.


>> Good.


>> Isn't
 that
 helpful?


>> Cuz
 I
 often
 just
 look
 at
 the
 back
 of


labels
 and
 I
 just
 go
 straight
 for
 the


carbs
 and
 sugar
 level.


>> Really?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 don't know
 why
 I
 always


look
 at
 the
 the
 sugar
 level.
 I
 think


it's
 cuz
 I've
 done
 keto
 for
 a
 little


while.
 So,


>> kind
 of
 depends
 though
 because
 if
 you're


looking
 at
 like
 carbon
 sugars
 for
 a
 pack


of
 um
 table
 sugar
 versus


I
 don't
 know
 like
 a


>> protein
 shake.


>> Yeah,
 a
 protein
 shake.


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 it's
 a
 helpful
 place
 to


look.
 That's
 also
 where
 I
 look
 because


carbs
 carbs
 and
 sugars
 will
 tell
 you
 a


lot
 about
 what
 the
 food
 is
 going
 to
 do


to
 you.
 But
 also,
 it
 depends
 on
 the


ratio,
 right?
 If
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


protein
 also,
 then
 having
 carbs
 in
 there


is
 not
 going
 to
 create
 that
 big
 of
 a


glucose
 spike.
 If
 it's
 a
 product
 that


has
 just
 carbs,
 then
 yes,


>> a
 lot
 of
 people
 look
 at
 the
 calories.


>> Yeah.
 But
 calories
 are
 a
 very
 bad
 way
 of


assessing
 a
 food
 because
 two
 foods
 can


have
 the
 exact
 same
 number
 of
 calories


and
 be
 completely
 different
 in
 terms
 of


what
 they
 do
 to
 your
 body.
 So
 an
 avocado


and
 a
 donut,
 both
 200
 calories,
 vastly


different
 impact.
 It's
 like
 saying
 two


books
 are
 the
 same
 because
 they
 have
 the


same
 number
 of
 pages.


>> Calories
 and
 pages
 tell
 you
 nothing


about
 what's
 inside
 the
 food
 or
 inside


the
 book.
 We
 have
 to
 learn
 about


molecules.
 Which
 is
 why
 your
 reflex
 of


going
 to
 carbs
 and
 sugars
 is
 much


smarter
 because
 you're
 seeing
 what's


actually
 going
 to
 happen
 when
 you
 eat


the
 food.
 For
 example,
 avocado
 and


donut.
 The
 avocado
 mostly
 fat
 fiber


going
 to
 keep
 your
 glucose
 levels
 nice


and
 steady.
 Going
 to
 give
 your
 food


healthy
 fat,
 your
 body
 healthy
 fats.


Donut
 mostly
 sugars
 is
 going
 to
 create
 a


big
 glucose
 spike.
 Inflammation,
 aging,


crash,
 cravings,
 fatigue,
 it's
 going
 to


have
 a
 vastly
 different
 impact
 on
 your


body.
 So
 only
 looking
 at
 your
 diet


through
 the
 lens
 of
 calories
 is
 a
 very


bad
 idea
 because
 two
 diets
 can
 have
 the


exact
 same
 number
 of
 calories
 and
 you


can
 have
 a
 completely
 different


experience
 of
 life
 depending
 on
 what


you're
 actually
 eating.


>> And
 what's
 your
 um
 diet
 generally?
 Like


what
 time
 do
 you
 eat
 in
 the
 morning?
 Do


you
 do
 fasting
 or
 anything
 like
 that?


>> So
 no,
 I
 don't
 do
 fasting.
 So
 I'll
 have


breakfast
 in
 the
 morning
 always
 eggs.


Right
 now
 my
 my
 current
 kick
 is
 a
 bacon


and
 egg
 quadilla.
 super
 good.
 Um,
 with


coffee
 always
 with
 whole
 milk
 that
 I


love.
 Then
 for
 lunch,
 I'll
 have
 a
 veggie


starter
 if
 I'm
 having
 some
 carb
 heavy


lunch
 or
 I'll
 have
 like
 a
 collared
 green


chicken
 wrap
 with
 avocado
 and
 peppers.


>> Mhm.


>> After
 lunch,
 I
 always
 usually
 have


something
 sweet
 because
 I
 love
 sugar.
 I


love
 sugar.
 So,
 I'll
 have
 like
 some


chocolate
 or
 a
 nice
 cookie
 that
 I
 had


and
 then
 I'll
 try
 to
 move
 my
 body
 if
 I


can.
 This
 is
 the
 main
 thing
 that
 can
 get


a
 bit
 difficult.
 And
 then
 the
 evening
 is


when
 I
 have
 most
 carbs.
 I
 love
 having


rice
 or
 pasta
 at
 night.
 It
 just
 makes
 me


feel
 cozy.


>> What
 time?


>> As
 early
 as
 I
 can.
 I'm
 very
 unfrench
 in


that
 way.
 If
 I
 could
 have
 dinner
 at
 5:00


p.m.,
 I
 would.
 Um,
 but
 I
 would
 have
 no


more
 social
 life.
 So,
 maybe
 after
 my


baby's
 in
 bed,
 so
 like
 7:30,
 8.


>> And
 are
 you
 having
 vinegar
 before
 that


meal?


>> Um,
 it
 depends.
 If
 I
 don't
 have
 a
 veggie


starter,
 yeah,
 if
 I
 have
 a
 veggie


starter,
 I'll
 put
 some
 vinegar
 on
 the


veggie
 starter.


>> What
 else
 are
 you
 working
 on?
 What's


next
 for
 you,
 Jesse?
 One
 is
 mental


health
 because
 I
 have
 a
 deep
 passion
 for


mental
 health.
 It's
 the
 reason
 I
 got


into
 glucose
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 So,
 I


want
 to
 see
 if
 I
 can
 start
 putting


together
 some
 mental
 health
 packs
 based


on
 studies.
 This
 is
 something
 that's


been
 in
 the
 back
 of
 my
 mind
 for
 a
 long


time
 and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 find
 the
 time
 to


go
 there.
 And
 I'm
 working
 on
 new
 types


of
 content.
 I'm
 I'm
 just
 endlessly


inspired
 by
 what
 I'm
 able
 to
 to
 do
 and


how
 lucky
 I
 am
 to
 like
 dream
 up


something
 and
 be
 able
 to
 to
 put
 it


together.
 So,
 lots
 of
 surprises
 coming.


>> As
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 a
 closing
 treat
 on


this
 podcast
 where
 the
 last
 guest
 leaves


a
 question
 for
 the
 next.


>> I
 do
 know.


>> And
 the
 question
 left
 for
 you
 is,
 if
 you


could
 make
 the
 world
 a
 better
 place
 in


one
 way,
 what
 would
 you
 change?
 How


could
 you
 make
 the
 most
 impact?


>> I
 would
 maybe
 outlaw
 food
 marketing
 or


maybe
 outlaw


sugary
 breakfast
 foods.
 Something
 about


making
 very
 bad
 foods
 that
 are
 that
 look


healthy,
 making
 those
 illegal.
 It
 would


be
 illegal
 to
 put
 any
 health
 claims
 on
 a


product.
 For
 example,
 no
 added
 sugars
 or


vegan
 or
 gluten-free.
 I
 would
 outlaw
 all


of
 those
 to
 help
 people
 navigate
 a
 bit


better.
 Or
 if
 I
 could
 have
 like
 one


magic
 wand
 to
 do
 one
 thing,
 maybe
 I


would
 say
 no
 more
 fruit
 juice
 in


schools.
 Even
 that
 would
 be
 really
 cool.


>> Nine
 months
 that
 count
 forever.
 How
 your


pregnancy
 diet
 shapes
 your
 baby's


future.
 What
 is
 the
 um
 what
 is
 the


closing
 message,
 Jesse,
 for
 for
 pregnant


couples
 and
 um
 anybody
 who
 was
 who
 was


once
 conceived
 of
 themselves?


>> The
 closing
 message
 is
 pregnancy
 is


complicated.
 The
 food
 system
 we
 live
 in


is
 complicated
 and
 toxic.
 And
 this
 is
 a


very
 simple
 four-step
 trimester
 by


trimester
 plan
 that
 doesn't
 require
 a


lot
 of
 money
 that
 is
 going
 to
 help
 you


give
 your
 baby
 the
 best
 foundation


during
 development.


Do
 you
 think
 there's
 things
 from
 a


legislation
 perspective
 that
 can
 be


done?
 You
 know,


>> yeah,
 the
 most
 important
 is
 for
 the


system,
 the
 support
 system
 around
 the


moms
 to
 help
 make
 it
 really
 easy
 for


them
 to
 eat
 eggs
 and
 sardines
 and


vegetables
 and
 healthy
 fats.
 We
 have
 to


all
 support
 moms
 because
 they're


creating
 the
 next
 generation
 and
 they


they
 can't
 change
 the
 food
 industry.


Things
 have
 to
 shift
 around
 them
 to
 make


it
 easier.
 I
 think
 it's
 also
 about


education.
 For
 example,
 choline,
 you


know,
 I
 said
 90%
 of
 moms
 are
 not
 getting


enough.
 And
 when
 people
 run
 surveys
 to


see
 whether
 doctors
 are
 talking
 to
 moms


about
 choline,
 only
 six%
 of
 doctors
 are


talking
 to
 moms
 about
 choline
 during


pregnancy.
 So
 there's
 also
 just
 a
 big


information
 gap
 somewhere.
 Things
 are


broken
 in
 lots
 of
 different
 areas.
 And


maybe
 it's
 like,
 oh,
 moms
 can't
 handle


it.
 Or
 maybe
 it's
 just
 that
 doctors
 are


focused
 on
 very
 short-term
 like


emergency
 things
 to
 manage.
 Maybe
 they


don't
 have
 time
 to
 talk
 about
 nutrition.


I
 don't
 know.
 But
 there's
 a
 real
 gap.


And
 I'm
 hoping
 this
 book
 will
 fill
 it.


I'm
 hoping
 like
 this
 is
 pie
 in
 the
 sky.


Like
 why
 don't
 we
 prescribe
 nine
 months


that
 count
 forever
 to
 every
 parent
 that


gets
 pregnant.


>> This
 will
 be
 a
 very
 good
 nutrition
 guide


for
 them
 and
 very
 simple.


>> I
 have
 many
 people
 in
 my
 life
 that
 are


currently
 pregnant,
 people
 that
 are


very,
 very
 close
 to
 me.
 And
 um
 it's


funny
 because
 you
 hear
 the
 conversations


they're
 having
 and
 it
 does
 kind
 of


sometimes
 feel
 like
 horoscopes
 and


guessing.


No
 offense
 to
 people
 that
 love


horoscopes,
 but
 it
 does
 feel
 a
 little


bit
 sort
 of
 pie
 in
 the
 sky.
 Yeah,
 I


know.
 like
 this
 is
 You
 don't


know
 your
 sign.
 I'm
 Virgo,
 I
 think.


>> Okay,


>> people.
 I
 knew
 he
 was
 a
 Virgo.
 I'm
 not


really
 on
 Sagittarius,


but
 it
 is
 it's
 it's
 it's
 confusing


because
 there's
 so
 much
 information
 out


there.
 So,
 it's
 wonderful
 to
 have
 a


manual
 like
 this
 that
 demystifies
 an


area
 where
 there's
 just
 so
 much


information
 coming
 at
 you
 and
 there's
 so


much
 conflicting
 information.
 And
 your


book
 is
 so
 importantly
 based
 on


scientific
 consensus
 and
 and
 facts
 and


studies
 versus
 just
 experience
 alone.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 it's
 so


important.
 And
 whenever
 the
 time
 comes


that
 me
 and
 my
 fiance
 are
 fortunate


enough
 hopefully
 to
 have
 our
 own
 baby,


um
 we're
 both
 going
 to
 reread
 this
 book


because
 it's
 hard
 to
 find
 books
 on
 this


subject
 that
 are
 so
 succinct
 that
 break


it
 down
 stage
 by
 stage.
 And
 uh
 you
 as
 an


author,
 you
 have
 a
 wonderful
 way
 of


making
 things
 accessible.
 Even
 in
 this


conversation,
 you
 you
 I
 don't
 need
 to


ask
 you
 to
 define
 complicated
 words
 and


that's
 reflected
 in
 all
 the
 work
 that


you
 do
 in
 everything
 that
 you
 write.
 So,


highly
 recommend.
 Great
 book
 to
 buy
 for


someone
 as
 a
 gift
 if
 you
 just
 found
 out


that
 someone
 in
 your
 life
 is
 pregnant,


but
 also
 a
 great
 book
 to
 buy
 for
 you
 and


your
 partner
 if
 you're
 going
 through


your
 own
 pregnancy
 journey
 or
 thinking


about
 getting
 pregnant
 soon.


>> It's
 also
 a
 good
 book
 to
 buy
 for
 your


kids
 for
 all
 the
 grandparents
 to
 be
 out


there.
 It's
 a
 good
 book
 to
 buy
 for
 your


kids
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 baby


soon.


>> Amen,
 Jesse.
 Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me
 back,


Stephen.
 It's
 always
 a
 pleasure.


>> YouTube
 have
 this
 new
 crazy
 algorithm


where
 they
 know
 exactly
 what
 video
 you


would
 like
 to
 watch
 next
 based
 on
 AI
 and


all
 of
 your
 viewing
 behavior.
 And
 the


algorithm
 says
 that
 this
 video
 is
 the


perfect
 video
 for
 you.
 It's
 different


for
 everybody
 looking
 right
 now.
 Check


this
 video
 out
 and
 I
 bet
 you
 you
 might
