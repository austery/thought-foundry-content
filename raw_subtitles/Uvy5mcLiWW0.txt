If
 you
 had
 to
 give
 one
 relationship


ritual
 to
 stay
 in
 love,
 what
 would
 that


be?
 Once
 a
 week,
 tell
 your
 partner
 three


things
 that
 you
 love
 about
 them
 and


three
 things
 they
 could
 have
 done


better.


>> But
 some
 people
 thinking,
 well,
 and
 if
 I


told
 Dave
 that
 we're
 going to
 start


writing
 these
 notes
 to
 each
 other,
 he's


going
 to
 cringe
 and
 not
 going
 to
 do
 it.


[ __ ]
 Honestly,
 Dave
 can't
 name


three
 things
 he
 likes
 about
 you.
 Really,


Dave?
 Is
 that
 a
 big
 ask?
 I
 absolutely


call
 bull
 on
 that.
 The
 bigger
 question


is
 what's
 uncomfortable
 about
 that
 for


you?
 And
 look,
 I'm
 not
 a
 therapist.
 I'm


a
 divorce
 lawyer.
 I
 represent
 some
 of


the
 most
 high
 achieving
 minds,
 athletes,


entrepreneurs,
 and
 they're
 just
 as
 bad


at
 this
 as
 anybody
 because
 there's
 a


part
 of
 us
 that's
 afraid
 to
 poke
 at
 what


do
 you
 love
 about
 me?
 What
 am
 I
 getting


wrong?
 And
 it's
 not
 just
 romantic


relationships.
 Like,


my
 mom
 died
 10
 years
 ago
 after
 a
 long


battle
 with
 cancer.


There
 was
 a
 lot
 between
 us
 that
 needed


to
 be
 said
 and
 wasn't
 said.


And
 there's
 a
 part
 of
 me
 that
 wishes
 she


was
 here
 so
 that
 I
 could
 have
 apologized


for
 some
 things
 I
 got
 wrong.
 But
 we


don't
 do
 that
 because
 people
 just
 don't


want
 temporary
 discomfort.
 And
 so
 I


think
 there's
 something
 deeply


courageous
 about
 love,
 about
 commitment,


about
 saying
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 them
 the


opportunity
 to
 hurt
 me.
 Like
 it's
 scary,


but
 I'm
 brave.
 You
 know,
 your
 marriage


will
 end.
 It
 ends
 in
 death
 or
 divorce.


And
 for
 two
 people
 at
 the
 end
 of
 their


relationship
 to
 say,
 "This
 person
 helped


me
 become
 the
 most
 authentic
 version
 of


myself."
 That's
 the
 greatest
 gift
 you


could
 give
 to
 another
 human
 being.
 And


as
 you
 can
 see
 from
 this
 photo,
 I
 just


proposed
 to
 my
 fiance.
 I'd
 like
 some


advice
 on
 how
 not
 to
 mess
 this
 up.
 Like


if
 my
 fiance
 ends
 up
 walking
 into
 your


practice,
 what
 is
 the
 reason
 she's


likely
 to
 end
 up
 there?
 The
 number
 one


reason
 that
 I'm
 going
 to
 have
 a
 woman


sitting
 across
 from
 me,
 divorcing


someone
 who's
 a
 great
 provider,
 great


protector
 is


>> that
 is
 not
 obvious
 to
 everybody


>> and
 it'll
 keep
 me
 in
 business
 for
 the


rest
 of
 my
 life.


>> Guys,
 I've
 got
 a
 quick
 favor
 to
 ask
 you.


We're
 approaching
 a
 significant


subscriber
 milestone
 on
 this
 show
 and


roughly
 69%
 of
 you
 that
 listen
 and
 love


this
 show
 haven't
 yet
 subscribed
 for


whatever
 reason.
 If
 there
 was
 ever
 a


time
 for
 you
 to
 do
 us
 a
 favor,
 if
 we've


ever
 done
 anything
 for
 you,
 given
 you


value
 in
 any
 way,
 it
 is
 simply
 hitting


that
 subscribe
 button.
 And
 it
 means
 so


much
 to
 myself,
 but
 also
 to
 my
 team,


because
 when
 we
 hit
 these
 milestones,
 we


go
 away
 as
 a
 team
 and
 celebrate.
 And


it's
 the
 thing,
 the
 simple,
 free,
 easy


thing
 you
 can
 do
 to
 help
 make
 this
 show


a
 little
 bit
 better
 every
 single
 week.


So,
 that's
 a
 favor
 I
 would
 ask
 you.
 And


um
 if
 you
 do
 hit
 the
 subscribe
 button,
 I


won't
 let
 you
 down
 and
 we'll
 continue
 to


find
 small
 ways
 to
 make
 this
 whole


production
 better.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


being
 part
 of
 this
 journey.
 Means
 the


world.
 And
 uh
 yeah,
 let's
 do
 this.


James,


as
 you
 can
 see
 from
 this
 photo,
 I
 just


proposed
 to
 my
 fiance
 and
 gladly
 she


said
 yes.
 So,
 I've
 brought
 you
 here
 in


part
 because
 I'd
 like
 some
 advice
 on
 how


not
 to
 mess
 this
 up
 because
 I
 know
 from


speaking
 to
 you
 previously
 about
 50%
 of


people
 that
 get
 down
 on
 their
 knee
 end


up
 messing
 it
 up
 in
 some
 way.
 Before
 we


get
 into
 this
 though,
 and
 before
 you


help
 me
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 stay
 in
 love


and
 not
 mess
 it
 up.


>> Yeah.


>> Where
 do
 you
 find
 us
 at
 as
 it
 relates
 to


love
 as
 a
 society?
 If
 you
 were
 to
 zoom


out
 and
 diagnose
 society's
 relationship


with
 the
 subject
 of
 love
 and
 their
 um


ability
 to
 keep
 it,
 find
 it,
 and


understand
 it,
 where
 are
 we?


>> I
 think
 we
 we're
 in
 this
 really


uncomfortable
 moment
 as
 a
 culture.
 I


think
 we
 we
 want
 more
 than
 anything
 to


feel
 real
 connection.
 I
 think
 we're
 sick


of
 just
 looking
 at
 screens.
 I
 think
 we


came
 out
 of
 the
 pandemic
 with
 a
 feeling


of,
 okay,
 I
 want
 to
 be
 in
 the
 world
 with


other
 people
 and
 feel
 the
 warmth
 of
 real


people.


And
 yet,
 we
 have
 an
 increasingly


lower
 number
 of
 useful
 tools
 in
 finding


connection
 and
 staying
 connected,
 which


are
 two
 totally
 different
 skills.
 And


yet
 we're
 yearning
 for
 it
 more
 than


ever.
 So
 we're
 more
 hungry
 than
 we've


ever
 been
 and
 we
 have
 no
 idea
 how
 to


cook


>> in
 your
 head
 because
 you've
 seen
 so
 many


people
 go
 through
 divorce
 and


relationships
 fail.


>> There
 must
 be
 a
 sort
 of
 checklist
 of


things
 that
 I'm
 likely
 to
 mess
 up.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 well,
 you
 know,
 first
 of


all,
 when
 I
 when
 I
 knew
 you,
 you
 know,


heard
 you
 got
 engaged,


>> I
 was
 thrilled
 because
 I'm
 always


cheering
 for
 people.
 I
 really
 am.
 I'm


always
 cheering
 for
 love.
 And
 so
 I
 think


in
 our
 prior
 conversations,
 you're


obviously
 someone
 who
 loves
 very
 deeply


and
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 found
 this


person,
 you
 know,
 to
 me
 is
 the
 most


lovely
 thing.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 at
 its


core,
 this
 is
 your
 favorite
 person.
 I


just
 can't
 think
 of
 anything
 more
 lovely


than
 that.
 Like
 the
 idea
 that
 you
 would


look
 at
 a
 person
 and
 go,
 "You're
 my


favorite
 person."
 And
 and
 that
 person


would
 look
 at
 you
 and
 say,
 "You're
 my


favorite
 person."
 And
 that
 you
 would


know
 that
 it's
 true.
 like
 when
 they
 say


it
 that
 it's
 true.
 Like
 that
 that
 feels


to
 me
 like
 something
 worth
 pursuing.


That
 feels
 like
 something
 that
 if
 I


tried
 to
 get
 it
 and
 I
 failed,
 I'd
 try


again
 because
 if
 you
 could
 find
 it,
 it's


just
 about
 the
 greatest
 thing
 in
 the


world.
 Like
 the
 the
 thought
 to
 me
 that,


you
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 won't
 get
 to
 give
 a


toast
 at
 your
 wedding,
 but
 I
 will
 say


that
 if
 I
 was
 going
 to
 give
 the
 toast,


it
 would
 be
 that
 there
 are
 two
 wishes
 I


have
 for
 you.
 You
 know,
 your
 marriage


will
 end.
 I
 mean,
 I've
 said
 it
 to
 you


before
 in
 one
 of
 our
 first


conversations.
 Every
 marriage
 ends.
 It


ends
 in
 death
 or
 divorce.
 I
 hope
 yours


ends
 in
 death.
 And
 I
 hope
 when
 it
 ends


in
 death
 that
 let's
 send
 you
 off
 first


that
 when
 you're
 dying
 that
 she
 will
 say


hopefully
 to
 you
 or
 to
 those
 around,


you
 helped
 me
 become
 the
 most
 authentic


version
 of
 myself
 and
 you're
 still
 my


favorite
 person.


Because
 I
 can't
 think
 of
 a
 greater


blessing
 than
 that.
 like
 for
 two
 people


at
 the
 end
 of
 their
 life,
 at
 the
 end
 of


their
 relationship
 to
 say,
 "This
 person


helped
 me
 become
 the
 most
 authentic


version
 of
 myself
 and
 they're
 still
 my


favorite
 person."
 That's
 the
 greatest


gift
 you
 could
 give
 to
 another
 human


being,
 I
 think.
 And
 I
 like
 the
 idea
 that


even
 in
 the
 face
 of
 knowing
 that
 this
 is


risky,
 this
 is
 something
 that
 may
 not


work,
 this
 is
 something
 that


statistically
 the
 odds
 are
 against,
 but


I'm
 going
 to
 give
 it
 a
 shot
 because,
 you


know,
 there's
 something
 it
 adds
 to
 my


life
 and
 there's
 something
 I
 add
 to
 her


life
 and,
 you
 know,
 we're
 going
 to
 we're


going
 to
 give
 it
 a
 shot.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


found
 that
 very
 beautiful.
 As
 a
 divorce


lawyer
 who
 is
 also
 a
 very
 big
 fan
 of


love,
 do
 you
 ever
 find
 yourself
 trying


to
 get
 someone
 not
 to
 get
 a
 divorce,
 has


there
 ever
 been
 an
 instance
 where
 you


you
 looked
 at
 the
 situation
 and
 thought,


you
 know
 what,
 they
 should
 just
 get
 back


together?
 Yeah.
 I
 what
 I'll
 say
 is
 my


first
 thought
 is
 often,


is
 this
 person
 accurately
 perceiving
 the


situation
 that
 they're
 in?
 So
 people


will
 come
 in
 and
 they'll
 say,
 you
 know,


it
 really
 people
 come
 to
 me
 in
 very


different
 situations.
 So
 sometimes


people
 will
 come
 to
 me
 and
 they're


they're
 they've
 been
 served
 with
 divorce


papers
 like
 the
 marriage
 is
 over
 and
 now


it's
 about
 okay
 we
 have
 to
 react


defensively.
 So
 you
 know
 when
 people


come
 to
 my
 office
 the
 situation
 is
 often


so
 dire
 and
 so
 broken
 that
 they're


coming
 in
 to
 hire
 me
 for
 that
 specific


purpose.
 But
 I
 will
 say
 without
 question


that
 if
 I
 get
 any
 sense
 that
 this
 person


would
 either
 a
 benefit
 from
 individual


therapy
 that
 might
 help
 them
 view
 the


relationship
 differently
 and
 come
 to
 the


relationship
 differently.
 I
 will
 not


hesitate
 to
 refer
 them.
 And
 then
 there


are
 people
 that
 and
 it's
 more
 common


than
 you'd
 think
 that
 something
 awful


has
 happened
 in
 the
 relationship.
 They


had
 an
 affair
 and
 got
 caught.
 they


caught
 their
 spouse
 having
 an
 affair.
 Uh


they've
 lost
 their
 job
 and
 it
 created


tremendous
 discord
 in
 their


relationship.
 And
 that
 often
 will
 feel


to
 me
 like
 something
 that
 perhaps
 would


benefit
 from
 the
 intervention
 of
 mental


health
 professionals
 or
 everyone
 just


taking
 a
 breath
 and
 taking
 a
 minute,


especially
 when
 there's
 kids
 involved,


but
 even
 when
 there
 aren't.


>> Are
 your
 clients
 predominantly
 men
 or


women?


>> It's
 pretty
 much
 an
 even
 split
 really.


>> Yeah.
 I
 represent
 a
 lot
 of
 either
 very


high
 achieving
 high-
 netw
 worth


individuals
 or
 people
 married
 to
 them.


>> And
 are
 the
 reasons
 that
 they
 come
 to


you,
 those
 two
 different
 groups,


>> different?


>> Like
 the
 reason
 why
 they
 want
 a


separation,
 is
 it
 fundamentally


different?


>> So
 the
 specific
 example
 of
 cheating,
 I


would
 say
 men
 get
 caught
 cheating
 more


often
 than
 women.


>> Does
 that
 mean
 they
 cheat
 more?


>> No,
 it
 means
 they
 get
 caught
 cheating


more.
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 anyone
 could


really
 truly
 accurately
 say,
 you
 know,
 I


know
 people
 love
 statistics
 and
 I
 know


that
 that,
 you
 know,
 guests
 have
 a


tendency
 to
 come
 out
 and
 say,
 well,
 72%


of
 people
 who
 are
 everything
 I'm
 saying


is
 based
 on
 what
 I've
 observed
 in
 25


years
 of
 facilitating
 the
 demise
 of


marriages.
 Men
 and
 women
 both
 cheat.
 Men


cheat
 in
 just
 more
 scattershot
 stupid


ways
 than
 women
 do.
 When
 women
 cheat,
 in


my
 experience
 professionally,
 it's


usually
 an
 indication
 of
 like
 the
 it's


the
 absolute
 end
 of
 this
 relationship.


The
 relationship
 is
 over
 and
 this
 is


either
 a
 soft
 place
 to
 land
 or
 it's
 sort


of
 a
 final
 opportunity
 for
 this
 person


to
 solidify,
 this
 woman
 to
 solidify
 in


her
 head
 that
 yeah,
 this
 thing
 is
 over.


Whereas
 men,
 I
 I've
 really
 had
 hundreds


at
 this
 point
 of
 men
 sit
 across
 from
 me


who've
 been
 caught
 in
 an
 affair
 or
 sense


that
 they're
 about
 to
 get
 caught
 in
 an


affair
 and
 they
 say
 to
 me
 like,
 "Yeah,


this
 had
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 my
 wife.


Like,
 I
 love
 my
 wife.
 It
 had
 nothing
 to


do
 with
 that.
 It
 just
 I
 don't
 know.
 I


just
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 I
 did
 what
 I
 did.


I
 just
 did
 it."
 And
 I
 I
 know
 everyone


kind
 of
 wants
 to
 because
 in
 civilized


society
 it
 feels
 good
 to
 kind
 of
 go
 like


I
 can't
 believe
 that.
 That's
 how
 could


someone
 say
 that?
 But
 shut
 up.
 Like
 if


you
 have
 you
 have
 potato
 chips
 in
 your


cabinet,
 you
 know,
 you
 you
 you
 know
 that


you're
 not
 supposed
 to
 eat
 them.
 You


don't
 want
 to
 eat
 them.
 You
 want
 vibrant


good
 health.
 You
 want
 to
 take
 care
 of


your
 but
 they're
 there.
 They're
 there.


And
 you're
 human.
 And
 like
 I
 can
 control


my
 food
 environment
 better
 than
 my


brain.
 Like
 I
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 resolve
 when


I
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning.
 But
 at
 about
 7


8:00
 at
 night
 when
 I'm
 a
 little
 bit


tired
 and
 it's
 been
 a
 long
 day
 and
 I


deserve
 something
 nice,
 if
 the
 potato


chips
 are
 there,
 I'm
 eating
 the
 potato


chips.
 Like,
 we're
 human.
 We're
 human.


There
 are
 times
 where
 we're
 just
 feeling


lonely
 or
 hungry
 or
 angry
 or
 tired
 or


some
 combination
 of
 those
 factors.
 and


this
 warm
 thing
 like
 the
 connection
 to


another
 person,
 the
 the
 joy
 of


flirtation,
 the
 excitement
 of
 of
 feeling


the
 energy
 between
 yourself
 and
 whatever


it
 is
 type
 of
 person
 that
 you're


attracted
 to.
 I
 think
 it's
 very
 normal.


And
 then
 the
 problem
 becomes
 that
 you're


not
 thinking
 about
 the
 consequences
 of


those
 things.
 If
 you
 were
 thinking
 about


the
 consequences
 of
 those
 things,
 you'd


make
 better
 choices.
 But
 we
 all
 know


that
 discipline
 is
 trading
 what
 you
 want


now
 for
 what
 you
 want
 most.
 And


sometimes
 it's
 hard
 to
 remember
 what
 you


want
 most
 and
 to
 keep
 it
 in
 your
 line
 of


sight.


>> So
 from
 your
 experience,
 you
 know,
 if
 my


fiance
 someday
 ends
 up
 walking
 into
 your


practice,
 what
 is
 the


reason
 she's
 likely
 to
 end
 up
 there
 from


her
 perspective
 asking
 you
 to
 help
 her


get
 out
 of
 the
 relationship
 with
 me?


the
 most
 obvious,
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 be


like
 the
 most
 the
 average,
 the


statistical
 average,
 it
 would
 be
 that


you've
 stopped
 seeing
 her
 and
 stopped


noticing
 her
 in
 in
 the
 list
 of
 things


that
 are
 important
 to
 Steven,
 that
 she's


somewhere
 in
 the
 middle
 to
 bottom
 of


that
 list.
 Like
 for
 for
 a
 high
 achiever


like
 you,
 for
 someone
 who's


entrepreneurial
 in
 the
 manner
 that
 you


are,
 for
 someone
 who,
 you
 know,
 lives


the
 kind
 of
 lifestyle
 that
 you
 do
 where


you're
 on
 this
 coast
 one
 day
 and
 this


country
 another
 day
 and
 flying
 here
 on
 a


moment's
 notice
 and
 getting
 invitations


to
 interesting
 things
 and
 you
 have
 to


triage
 because
 you
 couldn't
 possibly
 do


all
 the
 things
 that
 you'd
 like
 to
 do.
 It


usually
 would
 be
 that
 she
 just
 feels


herself
 slipping
 in
 the
 rankings.
 And
 I


think
 that
 that
 is
 often
 not
 a
 function


of
 what
 you're
 like
 that
 lifestyle
 I


just
 described.
 It's
 a
 function
 of
 where


you
 take
 time
 to
 fit
 her
 into
 that.


Because
 I
 genuinely
 have
 found


tremendous
 number
 of
 examples
 of
 people


who
 and
 this
 is
 in
 the
 relationship
 work


who
 have
 that
 level
 of
 intensity
 in


their
 life
 and
 that
 level
 of
 chaos
 in


their
 schedule
 and
 it's
 unpredictable


but
 they
 have
 that
 ability
 every
 morning


or
 every
 afternoon
 or
 every
 once
 in
 a


while
 but
 consistently
 to
 say
 hey
 I
 have


a
 minute
 between
 recordings.
 I
 just


wanted
 you
 to
 know
 I
 was
 thinking
 of


you.
 Or
 hey,
 you
 know,
 I
 heard
 that
 song


when
 I
 was
 in
 the
 car
 from
 here
 to
 here


and
 it
 makes
 me
 think
 of
 you
 and
 I
 can't


wait
 to
 see
 you
 next
 week.
 You
 know,


something
 like
 that
 to
 me,
 like
 how
 hard


is
 that?
 By
 the
 way,
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be


like
 a
 global
 lifestyle.
 It
 could
 even


be,
 hey,
 we
 got
 a
 couple
 of
 kids
 and
 two


dogs
 and
 you
 know,
 my
 my
 mom
 is
 sick
 and


I
 got
 to
 tend
 to
 her
 so
 I'm
 super
 busy.


But
 how
 do
 you
 let
 your
 partner
 know,


hey,
 you're
 still
 really
 important.


we're
 still
 really
 connected
 to
 each


other
 because
 that's
 the
 number
 one


complaint.
 That's
 the
 number
 one
 reason,


particularly
 with
 women,
 that
 I'm
 going


to
 have
 a
 woman
 sitting
 across
 from
 me


divorcing
 someone
 who's
 a
 great


provider,
 great
 protector,
 great
 all
 of


those
 things.


>> That
 is
 not
 obvious
 to
 everybody.
 And


I'll
 be
 honest,
 it's
 not
 it
 wasn't


necessarily
 obvious
 to
 me.
 The
 way
 that


I
 operate
 naturally,
 and
 this
 is
 just


the
 way
 that
 I
 am.
 I've
 spoken
 to
 so


many
 of
 my
 friends
 to
 understand
 how


they
 operate
 and
 the
 way
 that
 their


brain
 works
 is
 when
 I'm
 here.


>> The
 only
 thing
 I'm
 thinking
 about
 is


this


>> and
 I
 almost
 I'm
 remarkable
 at


forgetting
 everything
 else


>> and
 and
 being
 completely
 here.


>> Now
 that
 sounds
 like
 a
 good
 thing,


>> but
 it
 also
 means
 that
 I
 can
 lose
 14


hours
 and
 forget
 to
 to
 check
 in.
 I
 can


forget,
 you
 know.


>> Is
 it
 is
 it
 also
 true
 when
 you're
 with


her?
 Yes.
 When
 we
 have
 scheduled
 the


time.


>> Good.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 when
 we
 schedule
 the
 time


to
 go
 and
 do
 something
 together,
 I'm
 I'm


there.
 I'm
 not
 on
 my
 phone.
 I'm
 not


doing
 anything
 else.


>> Good.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 tremendous


priority.
 I'm
 hearing
 more
 and
 more
 from


people
 the
 feeling
 of,
 yeah,
 we're


together,
 but
 we're
 not
 together.
 We're


sitting
 there
 and
 they're
 on
 their
 phone


or
 they're
 doing
 other
 things.
 And
 I


think
 that
 it's
 really
 really
 important


that
 one
 of
 the
 really
 important
 aspects


of
 relationship
 be
 that
 there
 is
 time


where
 you
 give
 each
 other
 that
 level
 of


focus.
 But
 again,
 you
 know,
 like
 it's


just
 not
 something
 we
 are
 necessarily


taught.
 We
 have
 maybe
 we
 have
 our


parents
 as
 models,
 but
 very
 often


they're
 they're
 not
 good
 models.


>> What's
 interesting
 here
 as
 well
 is
 for


some
 reason
 I've
 chosen
 someone
 who's


like
 the
 opposite
 of
 me
 in
 terms
 of
 the


way
 that
 I


>> partly
 because
 she
 Yeah,
 probably.
 And


when
 I've
 spoken
 to
 some
 of
 my
 friends


who
 are
 quite
 like
 me,
 they've
 also


chosen
 partners
 who
 are
 the
 opposite
 of


them.


>> Could
 you
 imagine?
 I
 know.


>> Could
 you
 imagine
 two
 of
 you?
 Like


imagine
 me
 with
 me,
 you
 know,
 you
 with


you.
 That
 would
 like
 it
 would
 be
 so


intense.
 But


>> this
 is
 why
 it
 becomes
 so
 easy
 to


misunderstand
 because
 we
 go
 through
 life


assuming
 the
 other
 person
 has
 the
 same


perspective
 as
 we
 do


>> and
 they
 feel
 the
 same
 way
 that
 we
 do


about
 things.
 And


>> but
 what's
 the
 solution
 to
 that?
 I've


had
 to
 learn


to


check
 in.


>> Yeah.
 But
 don't
 you
 think
 she
 loves
 that


about
 you?


>> She
 does.
 She
 actually
 just
 sent
 me
 a


message
 this
 morning
 saying,
 "Thank
 you


so
 much."
 Because
 I
 said
 when
 I
 left


this
 time,
 I
 said, "Listen,
 I'm
 going to


FaceTime
 you
 every
 day,


>> even
 if
 it's
 for
 just
 one
 minute."


>> Yeah.


>> So,


>> isn't
 that
 lovely,
 though?
 You're
 still


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 can
 I
 be
 better


at
 this
 thing?
 And
 that's
 amazing.


That's
 a
 beautiful
 thing.
 You
 know


what's
 so
 funny
 is
 if
 I
 walked
 into
 your


home
 and
 on
 the
 table
 there
 was,
 you


know,
 the
 power
 of
 habit
 by
 during
 or


the
 seven
 habits
 of
 highly
 effective


people,
 I
 would
 go,
 "Oh,
 look
 at
 look
 at


Stephen.
 He's
 still
 so
 successful.
 He's


still
 trying
 to
 sharpen
 the
 point
 of
 the


spear.
 Amazing."
 You
 know,
 but
 if
 you


walk
 in
 and
 you
 see
 a
 book,
 you
 know,


how
 to
 stay
 in
 love,
 you
 go,
 "Things
 all


right
 with
 Stephen?
 Like
 things
 going


okay?
 What's
 going
 on
 with
 the


relationship?"
 Why?
 Why
 don't
 we
 as
 a


society
 just
 acknowledge
 we're
 we're


kind
 of
 bad
 at
 this?
 We're
 kind
 of
 bad


at
 maintaining
 connection.
 We're
 kind
 of


bad
 at
 helping
 like
 feeling
 loved
 and


feeling
 worthy
 of
 love
 and
 helping
 our


partner
 feel
 loved
 and
 figuring
 out
 how


to
 maintain
 connection.
 And
 maybe
 the


key
 is
 that
 little
 thing,
 that
 one


minute
 facetime,
 that
 one
 minute
 of


saying,
 "Hey,
 maybe
 we
 should
 try
 this


other
 thing."
 What
 are
 you
 actually


saying?
 What
 you're
 actually
 saying
 is,


"I
 want
 to
 be
 good
 at
 this
 job.
 How
 can


I
 be
 good
 at
 this
 job?
 How
 can
 I
 stay


good
 at
 it?
 How
 can
 I
 get
 even
 better
 at


it?"
 Like,
 we
 go
 for
 the
 job
 interview


and
 we
 want
 this
 job
 so
 bad.
 Like,


that's
 what
 dating
 is.
 Dating
 is
 I'm


sending
 my
 resume
 all
 over
 the
 place.


I'm
 sending
 it
 all
 over
 the
 place.
 I


hope
 I
 can
 find
 something,
 something


that
 suits
 my
 skills
 and
 my
 needs
 and


where
 they
 want
 me
 and
 I'll
 be
 well


compensated
 and
 I'll
 get
 something
 from


it
 and
 I'll
 give
 something
 to
 it
 because


I
 have
 all
 this
 talent
 and
 I
 have
 all


this
 stuff
 and
 I
 want
 to
 give
 it
 to
 a


worthy
 cause
 and
 I
 want
 to
 be


compensated
 for
 that
 and
 I
 want
 to
 feel


part
 of
 something.
 That's
 all
 dating
 is


is
 it's
 a
 job
 interview
 and
 then
 you
 get


the
 job
 and
 for
 a
 little
 while
 you're


like
 I
 got
 the
 job.
 It's
 the
 oh
 my
 god


you
 should
 see
 the
 office
 is
 amazing
 and


you
 should
 and
 I
 could
 I
 knew
 exactly


what's
 going
 you
 know
 there's
 room
 for


growth.
 There's
 room
 for
 growth
 in
 this


job.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 great,
 you
 know,


and
 I
 I
 really
 feel
 like
 there's
 room


for
 advancement.
 Like,
 this
 could
 be
 the


job.
 This
 could
 be
 my
 career.
 This
 could


be
 my
 vocation.
 It
 could
 be
 meaningful


and
 wonderful.
 I
 think
 I
 have
 something


I
 could
 contribute
 to.
 And
 we're
 so


excited.
 And
 you
 jump
 ahead
 3
 years


later
 and
 we're
 like,
 that
 [ __ ]
 job.


That
 job.
 Yeah.
 No,
 I
 got
 to
 go
 to
 work


again.
 Like,
 yep.
 All right.
 Here
 we
 go.


That's
 it.
 You
 know,
 I
 got
 a
 friend
 who


just
 got
 the
 best
 job.
 Oh
 my
 god.
 They


had
 their
 they
 got
 the
 great
 and
 that's


all
 we
 instead
 of
 trying
 to
 remember


that
 at
 some
 point
 the
 relationship
 that


you're
 in
 was
 something
 you
 aspired
 to


like
 the
 idea
 that
 you
 were
 someday


going
 to
 find
 a
 person
 who
 just
 was
 your


favorite
 person
 and
 you
 were
 their


favorite
 person
 and
 you
 were
 going
 to
 be


there
 for
 each
 other
 and
 see
 each


other's
 blind
 spots
 and
 help
 each
 other


like
 figure
 out
 who
 you
 are
 and
 be
 it


and
 that
 you
 were
 going
 to
 grow
 together


and
 change
 together.
 And
 some
 core


things
 would
 stay
 exactly
 the
 same.
 And


some
 things
 would
 change
 in
 beautiful,


meaningful
 ways.
 And
 you'd
 see
 each


other
 through
 amazing
 things
 and


terrible
 things
 and
 all
 the
 things
 that


the
 world
 throws
 at
 you.
 You'd
 never
 be


alone
 again
 because
 you'd
 have
 this


person
 like,
 and
 somehow


it's
 considered
 sort
 of
 odd
 to
 check
 in


and
 want
 to
 be
 good
 at
 that
 job
 and
 have


performance
 reviews.
 Like,
 you
 run


teams.
 you
 run
 so
 many
 teams.
 How
 how


often
 do
 you
 go,
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 have


performance
 reviews?


>> I
 think
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 this
 is
 we


assume
 probably
 through
 media
 and
 social


media
 that
 relationships
 are
 supposed
 to


be
 effortless.


>> Why?


>> I
 don't
 just
 kind
 of
 what
 you
 see,


right?
 Like
 I
 remember
 I
 remember
 um
 my


girlfriend
 telling
 me
 the
 other
 day,
 she


was
 like,
 "Oh,
 there's
 this
 couple
 I


follow
 on
 Instagram
 and
 they're
 like


amazing.
 um
 they're
 like
 the
 perfect


couple
 and
 it's
 just
 just
 turned
 out


that
 the
 guy
 is
 sleeping
 with
 someone


else.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 thought
 and
 again
 I
 thought


well
 that
 watch
 my
 girlfriend


vicariously
 watching
 that
 couple
 for
 the


last
 5
 years
 has
 probably
 increased
 her


expectations
 on
 what
 a
 relationship


should
 be
 cuz
 she's
 just
 had
 this
 sort


of
 two
 dimensional
 window
 but
 there
 was


some


the
 natural
 mess
 of
 relationship
 was


taking
 place
 outside
 of
 you
 and
 we
 all


just
 have
 the
 2D
 window
 like


relationship
 problems
 on
 Instagram


broadcasting
 that
 doesn't
 doesn't
 drive


followership.
 No.
 And
 what
 what what


I'll
 also
 say
 is
 look,
 we
 formulate
 a


lot
 of
 our
 conception
 of
 what
 a


relationship
 should
 look
 like
 by


portrayals
 of
 relationships
 in
 film
 and


television,
 right?
 Yeah.
 Okay.
 So,


>> can
 we
 agree
 that
 the
 romcom
 or
 the


romantic
 film


is
 basically
 just
 an
 emotional
 version


of
 pornography?
 like
 it's
 a
 stylized


excerted
 falsehood
 that's
 designed
 to


amplify
 the
 the
 most
 visually
 and


emotionally
 compelling
 or
 stimulating


aspects
 of
 things
 like
 yes
 there's


conflict
 but
 it
 gets
 cleaned
 up
 very


neatly
 and
 very
 nicely
 like
 there's
 it's


so
 this
 perception
 that
 that


relationships
 should
 be
 effortless


is
 based
 I
 think
 on
 largely
 that
 which


is
 this
 feeling
 that
 and
 again
 whether
 a


story
 is
 a
 comedy
 or
 a
 tragedy
 depends


and
 where
 you
 end
 the
 story,
 right?
 So,


we
 always
 end
 the
 story
 in
 a
 spot
 where


it's
 like,
 "Tada,
 they're
 in
 love
 and


they
 walk
 off
 hand
 in
 hand."
 But,
 right,


they
 walk
 off
 into
 life.
 They
 walk
 off


into
 this
 ecosystem
 of
 life
 that's


filled
 with
 complexity
 and
 there's


factors
 beyond
 our
 control
 that
 are


impacting
 our
 emotional
 state,
 the


emotional
 state
 of
 our
 partner,
 the
 you,


the
 me,
 and
 the
 Wii.
 So,
 there's
 a
 lot


going
 on
 and
 and
 the
 thought
 that,
 well,


this
 should
 be
 effortless.
 everything


else
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 and
 potentially


and
 by
 the
 way
 the
 opposite


like
 this
 is
 effortless
 and
 this
 is
 a


drudgery
 and
 we
 tend
 to
 just
 see
 things


in
 that
 binary
 way
 unnecessarily
 like


we've
 made
 so
 much
 progress
 as
 a
 society


when
 it
 comes
 to
 not
 viewing
 everything


in
 a
 binary
 like
 there's
 there's
 not
 as


much
 rigidity
 about
 gender
 roles
 anymore


there's
 not
 as
 rigidity
 about
 you
 know


are
 you
 a
 worker
 are
 you
 like
 a
 career


person
 or
 a
 family
 person
 like
 there's
 a


sense
 of
 weight.
 You
 can
 kind
 of
 be
 a


little
 bit
 of
 both.
 Like
 look
 at
 these


things
 as
 a
 spectrum
 a
 little
 bit.
 So,


but
 this
 we're
 still
 pretty
 glued
 into


this
 idea
 that
 like
 relationships
 are


supposed
 to
 be
 the
 smoothest,
 easiest


thing
 or
 relationships
 are
 hard
 work.


You're
 not
 supposed
 to
 be
 happy
 all
 the


time.
 And
 shut
 up
 if
 you
 think
 that


that's
 what
 you
 oh
 you're
 not
 happy.


Nobody's
 happy
 or
 you're
 not
 supposed
 to


be
 happy.
 That's
 not
 the
 point
 of


marriage.
 The
 point
 of
 marriage
 is
 a


commitment.


>> Are
 relationships
 supposed
 to
 be
 simple?


>> I
 don't
 know what
 you
 mean
 by
 simple.


Simple
 to
 navigate?
 No,
 they're


obviously
 not
 simple
 to
 navigate
 because


56%
 of
 them
 end
 in
 divorce.


>> Is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 hard?


>> If
 your
 definition
 of
 hard
 is
 I
 have
 to


pay
 some
 level
 of
 attention
 to
 it,
 then


yes,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 hard.
 Is
 that


hard?
 Like,
 is
 that
 hard?
 Really?
 Is


that
 hard?
 Like,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 that


hard.
 Paying
 attention
 isn't
 that
 hard.


Remembering
 to
 pay
 attention
 might
 be


hard,
 but
 don't
 you
 create
 reminders
 for


yourself?
 You've
 got
 so
 many
 gadgets
 and


you
 can't
 have
 some
 reminder
 in
 the
 day


of
 like,
 oh


her,
 keep
 her
 in
 my
 line
 of
 sight.


Again,
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 you
 don't
 love


her,
 that
 she's
 not
 front
 of
 mind.
 It


means
 you're
 a
 driven,
 hardworking


person.
 I'm
 a
 driven,
 hardworking


person.
 There's
 tons
 of
 times
 where
 very


important
 things
 in
 my
 life
 aren't
 front


of
 mind.
 But
 that's
 why
 I
 use
 reminders.


>> So
 to
 invert
 that
 question
 that
 I
 asked


at
 the
 top
 of
 this,
 if
 I
 am
 to
 come
 to


you
 at
 some
 point
 in
 the
 future,
 James,


and
 I
 say,
 "Listen,
 I
 need
 a
 divorce."


>> What
 am
 I
 likely
 to
 give
 as
 the
 reason


for
 that
 based
 on,
 you
 know,
 who
 I
 am


and
 how
 that
 correlates
 to
 the
 clients


like
 me
 that
 you
 deal
 with?


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 reason
 you're
 going
 to
 give


and
 the
 underlying
 reason
 is
 different.


So,
 the
 the
 reason
 you're
 going
 to
 give


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 practical
 reason,
 which


is
 either
 I've
 met
 someone
 else,
 she's


met
 someone
 else,
 um
 we've
 had
 a


terrible
 fight
 and
 uh
 I've
 said
 things


that
 we
 can't
 take
 back.
 I
 had
 a


spectacular
 failure
 financially
 and


she's
 just
 bailing
 on
 me
 because
 she


sees
 that
 the
 future's
 really
 rocky
 or


she
 made
 some
 terrible
 decision
 and
 did


something
 awful
 that's
 a
 betrayal
 that
 I


can't
 abide
 by.
 But
 again,
 that's
 the


presenting
 reason.


Underneath
 that
 is
 the
 bigger
 reason,


which
 is
 we
 lost
 the
 plot.


We
 lost
 the
 plot.
 Like
 that
 that's
 a


that's
 the
 start
 of
 a
 chapter
 in
 a


story.
 It's
 the
 end
 of
 a
 chapter
 and
 the


start
 of
 a
 chapter.
 That
 photo
 like
 the


first
 chapter
 in
 that
 story
 was
 was
 was


this
 person
 and
 this
 person
 wandering


around
 on
 the
 same
 planet
 trying
 to


figure
 it
 out,
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 what


they're
 doing.
 And
 they
 have
 their


origin
 story
 and
 they
 have
 their
 you


know
 their
 complimentary
 pathologies


that
 developed
 over
 time
 and
 then
 you


know
 they
 found
 each
 other.
 8
 billion


people
 in
 the
 world
 and
 somehow
 their


paths
 intersected
 you
 know
 and
 they


started
 to
 have
 this
 connection
 and
 so


there
 was
 the
 you
 and
 there
 was
 the
 me


and
 then
 there
 was
 the
 Wii
 and
 that
 ven


diagram
 started
 right
 and
 then
 you
 start


to
 fill
 it
 with
 things
 you
 fill
 it
 with


people.
 You
 fill
 it
 with
 experiences.


And
 this
 is
 just
 a
 stop
 along
 the
 way


like
 this.
 These
 two
 people,
 this
 is


just
 a
 moment.
 It's
 an
 incredible


moment.
 It
 can
 be
 like
 kuman.
 It
 can
 be


like
 a
 moment
 that
 there
 was
 this
 and


then
 everything
 after
 this.
 It's
 a


punctuation
 mark.
 Like
 I
 like
 to
 say


that
 life
 has
 punctuation
 marks.
 Like


you
 had
 a
 kid,
 you
 lost
 your
 job,
 you


got
 a
 job,
 whatever.
 Those
 are


punctuation
 marks.
 This
 is
 a
 big


punctuation
 mark.
 And
 it
 will
 either
 be


you
 know
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 end
 or
 the


end
 of
 the
 beginning.
 You
 get
 to
 write


that.
 You
 get
 to
 write
 that
 chapter.
 But


this
 is
 a
 moment
 for
 me.
 The
 reason
 why


this
 is
 a
 beautiful
 moment
 is
 this
 is
 a


moment
 of
 tremendous
 optimism.
 This
 is
 a


moment
 where
 the
 two
 of
 you
 said
 you're


my
 favorite
 person
 and
 and
 I
 I
 want
 to


write
 this
 next
 chapter
 with
 you
 as
 as


having
 a
 different
 title
 in
 it.
 But


really,
 like
 the
 title's
 just
 a
 symbol.


The
 the
 ring
 is
 just
 a
 symbol.
 It's
 just


a
 symbol
 of
 a
 commitment.
 It's
 a
 symbol


of
 of
 a
 promise.
 And
 all
 a
 promises
 is
 a


symbol
 of
 intention.
 That's
 all.
 It's


just
 an
 intention.
 Our
 intention
 is


we're
 not
 going to
 be
 alone
 anymore.


We're
 going
 to
 do
 this
 together.
 And
 by


the
 way,
 you're
 already
 not
 alone.
 The


fact
 that
 you
 got
 to
 this
 place
 that
 you


would
 ask
 this
 question,
 that
 that's
 a


beautiful
 confirmation
 of
 the
 fact
 that


you
 don't
 feel
 alone.


>> We
 would
 have
 lost
 the
 plot.


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 You
 would
 have
 lost
 the
 plot


of
 the
 story.
 I
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 story.


Where
 does
 this
 story
 go?
 Where
 do
 you


want
 it
 to
 go?
 You
 want
 it
 to
 go
 to
 a


future
 that
 features
 the
 two
 of
 you
 old


together
 someday.
 Maybe
 it
 features


children.
 Maybe
 it
 features
 companion


animals.


>> And
 what
 what
 is
 the
 most
 likely
 reason


that
 we
 would
 lose
 the
 plot?


>> You
 stop
 paying
 attention.


>> You
 stop
 you
 stop
 doing
 what
 you're


currently
 do.
 How
 did
 you
 get
 to
 this


beautiful
 moment?
 You
 start
 doing
 the


opposite.
 You
 got
 to
 this
 moment
 by


paying
 attention.
 You
 got
 to
 this
 moment


by
 making
 this
 a
 priority.
 You
 got
 to


this
 moment
 by
 by
 keeping
 this
 front
 of


mind.
 By
 valuing
 what
 is
 this
 but
 a


symbol
 of
 you
 are
 valuable
 to
 me.
 Why


did
 you
 get
 on
 one
 knee?
 Why
 do
 you
 get


on
 one
 knee?
 I
 mean,
 think
 about
 the


symbols
 of
 all
 of
 this.
 We
 live
 in
 a


world
 of
 symbols.
 Like
 the
 outfit
 I'm


wearing,
 I'm
 saying
 something
 to
 you.
 I


take
 this
 seriously.
 That's
 why
 you
 wear


a
 suit.
 is
 you
 wear
 a
 suit
 to
 say
 I
 take


this
 seriously.
 So
 what
 why
 did
 you
 do


this?
 What
 is
 this
 as
 simple?
 I'm
 down


on
 one
 knee.
 Why?
 I'm
 humbling
 myself
 in


front
 of
 you.
 I'm
 offering
 something
 to


you.
 I'm
 hoping
 you
 will
 accept
 the
 gift


I
 am
 giving
 to
 you.
 Like
 there's


something
 very
 lovely
 about
 that
 symbol.


>> Is
 this
 is
 this
 what
 you
 call
 slippage?


>> Slippage
 is
 exactly
 when
 you
 start
 to


unintentionally
 again
 people
 rarely
 have


slippage
 intentionally.
 It's
 usually


that,
 okay,
 we
 got
 that
 knocked
 out.
 Now


we
 can
 focus
 on
 the
 other
 stuff.
 And


that's
 slippage.
 Slippage
 is
 these
 small


disconnections.
 Small
 disconnections


that
 in
 of
 themselves
 mean
 nothing.
 Like


no
 single
 raindrops
 responsible
 for
 the


flood.
 That
 little
 raindrop,
 it's
 just
 a


little
 raindrop.
 That's
 all
 it
 really


is.
 But
 slippage
 is
 this
 gradually


increasing
 number
 of
 small


disconnections
 that
 eventually
 leads
 to


the
 giant
 marriage
 killer
 that
 you
 come


in
 and
 say,
 "Here's
 why
 we're
 getting


divorced."
 But
 it
 wasn't
 that.
 It
 it
 was


all
 these
 little
 pieces,
 but
 at
 some


point
 you
 were
 there.


>> Do
 you
 think
 people


spot
 the
 slippage
 in
 the
 moment,
 but


they
 don't
 think
 it's
 big
 enough
 to


fight
 about
 or
 do
 something
 about?


>> 100%.
 And
 that's
 that's
 the
 cognitive


bias.
 That's
 the
 fallacy
 that
 will
 keep


me
 in
 business
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 life


because
 people
 just
 don't
 want
 temporary


discomfort.
 Like
 our
 desire
 for
 joy


versus
 our
 aversion
 to
 pain,
 our


aversion
 to
 pain
 will
 win
 every
 single


time.
 We
 know
 this.
 That's
 why
 there
 was


an
 opiate
 crisis
 more
 so
 than
 a
 cocaine


crisis.
 Because
 one
 of
 those
 things
 is


about
 making
 you
 feel
 really
 good
 and


the
 other
 is
 about
 getting
 rid
 of
 pain.


Like
 the
 the
 human
 desire
 any
 scientist


will
 tell
 you
 this
 ask
 our
 friend
 Andrew


Huberman
 ask
 anybody
 they
 will
 tell
 you


the
 human
 desire
 to
 escape
 pain
 is
 the


controlling
 aspect
 of
 self.
 So
 escaping


pain
 even
 discomfort
 even
 dis
 and
 again


this
 is
 this
 is
 pushed
 by
 the
 narrative


that
 love
 should
 be
 easy.
 If
 you're


going
 to
 make
 if
 anything's


uncomfortable
 about
 it,
 you
 must
 be


doing
 it
 wrong.
 Maybe
 you're
 not
 with


your
 soulmate.
 You
 know,
 it
 would
 be
 so


easy
 and
 effortless.
 You'd
 always
 know


what
 the
 other
 person
 wanted.
 You'd


never
 have
 to
 tell
 them.
 They
 would


know.
 They
 would
 know
 you
 well
 enough
 to


know
 what
 it
 is
 that
 you
 need.
 And
 they


would
 get
 you.
 Even
 though,
 by
 the
 way,


really,
 really
 like
 I'm
 53
 years
 old.


I've
 been
 in
 therapy
 for
 20
 years.


I
 get
 like
 70%
 of
 this
 guy,
 I
 think,


like
 at
 best.
 Like,
 and
 I'm
 in
 here.
 I'm


in
 here
 and
 I
 get
 about
 70%
 of
 this
 guy.


Like,
 and
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 get
 you
 a


100%.


Because
 we're
 exchanging
 bodily
 fluids.


Like,
 we're
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 just
 cuz


we've
 slept
 in
 the
 same
 bed,
 I'm


supposed
 to
 get
 you
 100%
 and
 get
 ahead


of
 stuff.
 Like,
 I
 get
 me
 70%.
 And
 that's


with
 a
 lot
 of
 reflection.
 So,
 I
 I
 really


think
 that
 it's
 wildly
 unfair
 for
 us
 to


to
 to
 think
 that,
 you
 know,
 this
 should


be
 effortless,
 this
 should
 be
 easy,
 and


that
 it
 should
 never
 be
 uncomfortable.


It's
 okay
 to
 be
 like
 I
 I
 think
 because


of
 what
 I
 do
 for
 a
 living,
 I
 have
 to


tell
 people
 things
 they
 don't
 want
 to


hear
 all
 day
 because
 it's
 true.
 And
 I


tell
 them
 what
 they
 need
 to
 hear
 and
 not


what
 they
 want
 to
 hear.
 And
 you
 know,


when
 clients
 say
 to
 me
 at
 the
 end
 of
 a


consultation
 or
 conversation
 like,
 "Oh


my
 god,
 I
 feel
 so
 much
 better."
 better.


I
 always
 go,
 "That's
 great.
 That
 wasn't


my
 intention."
 Because
 I
 don't
 want


anyone
 I
 talk
 to
 professionally
 to
 think


I
 am
 telling
 you
 something
 to
 make
 you


feel
 better.
 I'm
 not
 here
 to
 make
 you


feel
 better.
 I'm
 not
 a
 therapist.
 I'm


here
 to
 tell
 you
 the
 truth.
 And
 if
 the


truth
 makes
 you
 feel
 better,
 great.
 If


the
 truth
 makes
 you
 uncomfortable,
 at


least
 you
 know
 the
 truth
 now.
 So,
 I
 feel


like
 in
 relationship
 again,
 if
 what
 you


want
 most
 is
 lasting
 lifelong
 connection


where
 we
 get
 each
 other
 as
 best
 we
 can,


we
 can
 help
 each
 other
 navigate
 self
 and


each
 other
 as
 best
 we
 can
 and
 we
 cannot


lose
 the
 plot
 of
 a
 story
 that
 is
 really


beautiful
 right
 now.
 So,
 everybody


listening
 can
 probably
 think
 about


something
 in
 their
 relationship
 which


has
 gotten
 a
 little
 bit
 worse


>> since
 they
 first
 got
 into
 that


relationship.
 And
 it
 could
 be
 the
 way


that
 they
 argue
 is
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


worse.
 They're
 not
 listening
 as
 much.


>> Maybe
 the
 voice
 the
 the
 tone
 has
 gone
 up


or
 it's
 getting
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 angry.


>> Um,
 whatever
 it
 is
 in
 their


relationship,
 what
 do
 they
 need
 to
 do


now?
 It's
 like
 it's
 not
 flooded
 yet.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 there's


>> best
 time
 to
 look
 at
 it,
 best
 time
 to


talk
 about
 it.
 There's
 a
 puddle.


>> So,
 what
 I
 do
 for
 a
 living
 in
 court


is
 I
 try
 to
 manipulate
 people's


emotional
 state.
 That's
 my
 job.
 Like,
 my


job
 is
 to
 go
 and
 make
 the
 judge
 like
 my


client,
 dislike
 the
 other
 side.
 I
 want


the
 other
 side
 to
 feel
 scared.
 I
 want
 my


client
 to
 feel
 safe.
 I
 want
 the
 court


reporter
 who's
 taking
 things
 down
 and


the
 court
 officer
 to
 like
 me
 and
 to
 like


my
 client
 so
 that
 when
 we
 take
 a
 break


in
 testimony
 and
 they
 go
 in
 the
 back


with
 the
 judge,
 they
 go,
 "I
 like
 Jim.


He's
 a
 really
 good
 lawyer."
 Or,
 "Oh,
 his


client
 seems
 so
 nice."
 Or,
 "Boy,
 the


other
 guy
 seems
 like
 a
 jerk."
 Or, "Boy,


that
 other
 lawyer
 is
 a
 jerk."
 Like
 so


I'm
 here
 manipulating
 people's
 emotional


state.
 That's
 my
 job.
 Like
 that's
 what
 a


trial
 lawyer
 does.
 We
 manipulate


people's
 emotional
 state.
 We
 play
 with


the
 levers,
 right?
 So
 I
 say
 this
 as
 to


say


we
 should
 be
 doing
 this
 in
 our


relationships.
 There's
 nothing
 nefarious


about
 that.
 These
 are
 tools
 and
 how
 you


use
 them
 will
 will
 give
 you
 a
 sense
 of


whether
 it's
 good
 or
 bad
 or
 what.
 Look,


if
 what
 you
 are
 doing
 is
 to
 maintain


connection,
 how
 you
 parse
 it
 is
 going
 to


be
 everything.
 So,
 even
 the
 way
 you
 just


said
 that,
 like,
 well,
 something's
 kind


of
 going
 wrong
 in
 the
 relationship.


Okay,
 we're
 already
 off
 to
 the
 wrong


narrative
 because
 when
 someone
 tells
 you


something's
 been
 done
 wrong,
 there's


this
 automatic
 defensive
 response
 of,


well,
 I
 didn't
 mean
 to
 do
 it
 wrong
 and


well,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 my
 fault
 that
 I


did
 it
 wrong.
 It
 brings
 out
 something


defensive
 in
 us
 rather
 than
 saying


something's
 changed.
 Have
 you
 noticed


that
 something
 changed?
 Have
 you
 noticed


that
 remember
 when
 we
 used
 to
 talk
 to


each
 other
 about
 you
 know
 sometimes
 like


and
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 something
 that


I've
 done
 and
 if
 it
 is
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I


really
 would
 appreciate
 you
 telling
 me


but
 like
 when
 we
 have
 been
 fighting


lately
 like
 that
 the
 tone
 seems
 to
 have


changed.
 Have
 you
 noticed
 that?
 Is
 it


just
 me?
 I
 now
 it's
 a
 non-defensive


dialogue.
 I'm
 not
 accusing
 you
 of


something.
 I'm
 noting
 that
 something
 has


changed.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 good.
 We
 love


each
 look
 at
 how
 much
 we
 love
 each
 other


in
 that
 picture.
 Like
 look
 at
 put
 the


wedding
 photos
 up
 somewhere.
 Look
 at


that
 moment.
 We
 were
 nuts
 about
 each


other
 in
 that
 moment.
 We
 were
 everything


the
 other
 person
 ever
 wanted
 and
 more.


So
 anytime
 something
 has
 changed
 from


that,
 don't
 you
 want
 to
 know?
 Don't
 you


want
 to
 know?
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 not
 in
 an


accusatory
 fashion.
 The
 most
 common
 one


is
 we're
 not
 having
 sex
 as
 much
 as
 we


used
 to.
 We're
 not
 having
 sex.
 We're
 not


having
 much
 sex.
 I'm
 not
 getting
 as
 much


oral
 sex
 as
 I
 used
 to
 get.
 We're
 not


getting
 Okay,
 there's
 a
 way
 to
 say
 that


the
 way
 I
 just
 said
 it.
 That's
 just


going
 to
 blow
 up
 in
 your
 face.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 work
 because
 it's,
 well,
 well,


YOU
 HAVEN'T
 BEEN
 AROUND
 AS
 MUCH.
 WELL,
 I


HAVEN'T
 BEEN
 AROUND
 AS
 much
 cuz
 I'm


working
 so
 much
 and
 I
 don't
 see
 you


spending
 less.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 honestly,


if
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 that,
 I'd
 spend
 a


lot
 to
 not
 have
 you
 treat
 me
 this
 way.


Now,
 we're
 just
 having
 a
 fight.
 Whereas,


if
 we
 say
 like,
 oh,
 remember
 how
 clo


remember
 when
 we
 went
 away?
 I
 was
 just


thinking
 yesterday
 about
 when
 we
 went


away
 that
 weekend.
 Remember
 we
 ended
 up


not
 even
 leaving
 the
 room?
 It
 was
 so


fun.
 I
 love
 when
 we're
 like
 feeling
 that


connected
 and
 close,
 you
 know?
 I
 feel


like
 I
 feel
 like
 lately
 sometimes
 like


we're
 maybe
 not
 as
 connected
 and
 close


like
 and
 if
 there's
 something
 I'm
 I'm


doing
 that's
 making
 that
 like
 I
 I
 really


want
 to
 get
 it
 right.
 Like
 I
 really
 want


to
 get
 it
 right.
 You
 know,
 there's


something
 about


apologizing
 first,
 like
 having
 some


humility
 in
 relationship
 that
 has


tremendous
 value.
 Like
 when
 a
 lawyer


like
 I'll
 I'll
 tell
 you
 one
 of
 my
 trade


secrets.
 You
 know,
 I
 my
 job
 is
 a
 very


combative
 job
 sometimes.
 So,
 there's


times
 where
 being
 very
 aggressive
 is
 the


right
 move.
 But
 there's
 times
 where


being
 aggressive
 just
 doesn't
 accomplish


anything.
 And
 if
 I'm
 interacting
 with
 a


lawyer
 for
 the
 first
 time,
 this
 is


someone
 I
 haven't
 had
 cases
 with.
 So,
 we


don't
 know
 each
 other
 except
 by


reputation
 and
 they
 come
 at
 me
 really


hard,
 the
 first
 thing
 I'll
 do
 is


apologize.
 I'll
 say,
 "You
 know,
 I
 I
 I'm


sorry.
 I
 just
 have
 to
 say
 like
 your
 tone


like
 you're
 coming
 at
 me
 like
 it
 if
 I


said
 something
 in
 our
 initial


interaction
 that
 made
 you
 feel
 like
 that


I
 didn't
 have
 respect
 for
 you
 or
 that


you
 know
 I
 didn't
 value
 your
 perspective


or
 like
 it
 I
 have
 a
 tendency
 to


interrupt
 people
 sometimes
 I
 have
 a


tendency
 to
 so
 if
 I
 offended
 you
 I


apologize
 because
 the
 way
 that
 you're


kind
 of
 talking
 to
 me
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 I


must
 have
 said
 something
 wrong
 or
 I
 must


have
 so
 I
 apologize
 absolutely
 if
 I
 did


what
 is
 the
 per
 what
 choice
 do
 they
 have


but
 to
 then


Oh,
 no,
 no,
 that's
 that's
 just
 my
 tone.


That's
 just
 how
 I
 Oh,
 yeah,
 of
 course.


Look,
 hey,
 we
 all
 have
 a
 game
 face
 or
 I


just
 felt
 like,
 oh
 my
 god,
 like
 this


guy's
 coming
 at
 me
 so
 hard.
 Like
 I
 I


felt
 like
 I
 must
 have
 said
 something


inadvertently
 or,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 then


everyone's
 kind
 of
 calmer
 now,
 you
 know?


So
 I
 think
 that
 this
 is
 a
 very
 easy
 way


to
 invite
 discussion
 about
 these
 small


preventative
 maintenance
 things
 without


turning
 it
 into
 a
 whole
 like
 because
 we


again
 we
 just
 think
 that
 oh
 if
 I
 bring


that
 up
 it's
 going
 to
 turn
 into
 a
 whole


thing.
 It
 doesn't
 have
 to
 turn
 into
 a


whole
 thing
 period.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 asked
 that
 in
 part


because
 I
 it's
 something
 that
 I
 I've


like
 subtly
 noticed
 that
 when
 we
 were


when
 we
 first
 met
 7
 years
 ago,
 we
 were


much
 more
 patient.


>> And
 I'm
 like,
 I
 probably
 need
 to
 have
 a


conversation
 about
 returning
 to
 being


more
 patient
 when
 we're
 trying
 to
 solve


problems.
 We
 kind
 of
 like
 rush
 through


them
 now.
 And
 I
 just
 I'm
 like,
 oh,
 you


play
 this
 forward.


>> You
 play
 this
 forward
 a
 decade
 or
 two


decades.
 I'm
 like,
 damn,
 we're
 really


not
 going
 to
 be
 great
 at
 solving


problems
 if
 we
 don't
 just
 like
 slow
 down


with
 them.
 Yeah.
 And


>> a
 lot
 of
 that
 just
 means
 like
 listening


to
 the
 other
 person's
 point
 of
 view
 a


bit
 bit
 more
 intently.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 hard.
 That's
 hard


because
 you
 know
 your
 your
 brain
 moves


quickly.
 Like
 it's
 something
 I
 struggle


with
 in
 relationship
 for
 sure.
 Like
 any


kind
 of
 relationship
 is
 I'm
 very
 like


all
 right,
 come
 on.
 We
 got
 to
 land
 this


plane.
 Like
 let's
 go.
 Like
 skip
 to
 the


end.
 Time
 is
 money.
 Like
 what
 are
 we


what
 are
 we
 doing?
 Where
 are
 we
 going


with
 this?
 Like
 and
 I
 I'm
 terrible
 at


it.
 I
 interrupt
 people
 constantly.
 Like


I'm
 I'm
 not
 good
 at
 that.
 And
 it's


something
 I'm
 working
 on
 because
 I
 I
 I


think
 I
 know
 what
 they
 have
 to
 say
 next.


And
 I'm
 wrong
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time,


especially
 in
 relationship,
 I'm
 wrong.


Like
 it's
 not
 a
 popular
 opinion
 to
 say


that
 men
 and
 women
 are
 different,
 but


men
 and
 women
 are
 different.
 And
 and
 and


I
 don't
 say
 that
 to
 say
 one
 is
 superior


and
 one
 is
 inferior.
 I
 say
 that
 to
 say


that
 we're
 different.
 We
 we
 navigate


things
 differently.
 We
 experience
 life


differently.
 We're
 treated
 differently


from
 a
 societal
 standpoint.
 We've
 had


different
 life
 experiences
 and
 I


genuinely
 believe
 that
 it
 would
 be
 very


valuable
 for
 us
 in
 relationship
 to
 to


sort
 of
 think,
 hey,
 I
 don't
 really
 know


everything
 about
 how
 this
 person
 is


wired.
 It
 took
 me
 fully


40
 some
 odd
 years,
 if
 not
 50,
 to
 figure


out
 that
 if
 I'm
 in
 a
 romantic


relationship
 with
 a
 woman
 and
 she
 comes


home
 and
 starts
 telling
 me
 about


something
 that's
 upsetting
 to
 her,
 that


she
 doesn't
 want
 what
 my
 male
 friends


want.
 Like
 if
 I
 called
 a
 buddy
 of
 mine,


if
 I
 called
 you,
 I've
 called
 you
 before.


If
 I
 called
 you
 and
 I
 said,
 "Stephen,


I'm
 having
 this
 problem,
 man.
 I'm


dealing
 with
 one
 of
 my
 sons
 and
 he's


doing
 XYZ."
 I
 ex
 if
 you
 went,
 "That
 must


be
 very
 hard,
 Jim.
 I'd
 be
 like,
 "Yes,
 it


is,
 Stephen.
 That's
 why
 I
 called
 you.
 Do


you
 have
 any
 suggestions?
 Like,
 what
 do


you
 think
 I
 should
 do
 here?
 Like,
 you're


a
 smart
 guy.
 I
 called
 you
 cuz
 I
 wanted


you
 to
 help
 me."
 Very
 often,
 that
 is
 the


opposite.
 Most
 women
 want
 you
 to
 hear


them.
 Give
 them
 some
 support.
 You
 guys


can
 have
 this
 conversation.
 A
 couple
 can


have
 this
 conversation.
 You
 can
 say,


"Hey,
 listen.
 right
 now
 in
 this
 moment,


we're
 not
 you're
 not
 coming
 to
 me
 with
 a


problem.
 But
 when
 you
 come
 to
 me
 with
 a


problem,
 my
 natural
 proclivity
 is
 to


start
 throwing
 solutions.
 And
 I've
 I've


learned
 or
 I
 I
 heard
 Stexton
 say
 on


Steven's
 show
 that,
 you
 know,
 maybe


that's
 not
 the
 best
 way.
 Do
 you
 find


that's
 true?
 Like,
 do
 you
 want
 me
 to


maybe
 like
 when
 you
 say
 these
 things,


could
 I
 because
 again,
 this
 is
 a
 job.
 I


want
 to
 be
 good
 at
 this
 job.
 Why
 Why
 is


it
 wrong
 for
 me
 to
 ask
 you
 how
 to
 how


can
 I
 be
 better
 at
 this
 job?
 I
 found
 it


really
 useful
 to
 state
 explicitly
 to
 my


fiance
 what
 my
 needs
 are
 in
 those


situations.
 And
 again,
 it
 didn't
 come


naturally
 to
 her
 and
 vice
 versa.
 Like
 it


didn't
 what
 she
 needs
 from
 me
 in
 those


situations


is
 the
 opposite
 of
 what
 I
 need
 from
 her


in
 those
 situations.
 I'm
 thinking


particularly
 when
 she's
 like
 going


through
 something
 and
 she's
 struggling


with
 something.
 She
 wants
 me
 to


be
 be
 present
 and
 she


um
 often
 wants
 like
 some
 advice
 on
 it


and
 she


and
 her
 advice
 is
 like
 the
 opposite
 of


mine
 often
 and
 in
 the
 inverse
 when
 I'm


going
 through
 those
 situations


I
 actually


don't
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 at
 all.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 just
 wanted
 to
 be
 there.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But
 please,


>> she
 wants
 to
 talk
 about
 I
 don't
 want
 to


talk
 about
 it.


>> But
 what
 but
 what
 would
 be
 wrong
 with


saying
 in
 that
 moment?


I've
 got
 a
 menu.


I've
 got
 a
 menu
 for
 you.
 Can
 you
 tell
 me


which
 one
 you
 want?
 Cuz
 just
 like
 just


like
 you
 said,
 you're
 hungry.
 And
 I


said,
 "What
 are
 you
 hungry
 for?
 Do
 you


want
 sushi?
 Do
 you
 want
 me
 to
 make
 you


something?
 Do
 you
 want
 some
 cheese


toast?
 Do
 you
 want
 us
 to
 go
 out


someplace
 and
 we
 can
 get
 burgers?
 What


is
 it
 you
 want?"
 Right?
 Couldn't
 you


just
 say,
 "Hey,
 I've
 got
 a
 menu.
 I
 can


just
 listen
 and
 tell
 you
 I
 love
 you
 and


just
 be
 here.
 I
 can
 give
 you
 some


solutions
 and
 and
 how
 I
 might
 handle
 the


problem.
 I
 can
 try
 to
 distract
 you
 and


tell
 you
 a
 funny
 story
 about
 something


that
 happened
 to
 me
 today
 or
 I
 can
 pick


you
 up
 and
 tickle
 you.
 We
 can
 go
 in
 the


other
 room
 and
 roll
 around
 in
 the
 sheets


for
 a
 little
 while
 and
 take
 your
 mind


off
 it
 and
 then
 we
 can
 figure
 out
 which


of
 the
 other
 options
 you
 might
 want.
 We


can
 go
 for
 a
 walk
 together
 and
 we
 can


talk
 about
 it
 or
 not
 talk
 about
 it.
 What


would
 you
 like
 on
 the
 menu?
 Because


that's
 I'm
 serving
 all
 of
 those
 things


for
 you.
 Which
 one
 would
 you
 like?
 And


the
 worst
 thing
 she
 could
 say
 is,
 "I


don't
 know."
 And
 you
 go,
 "Okay,
 then
 I'm


going
 to
 pick
 one.
 I'm
 going
 to
 pick


one.
 And
 if
 it
 feels
 good,
 great.
 And
 if


it
 doesn't,
 you'll
 tell
 me,
 okay?
 And
 I


won't
 be
 offended."
 Like
 again,
 what'


that
 take,
 Stephen?
 30
 seconds.
 30


seconds.
 Throw
 that
 out
 there.
 Like


that.
 That's
 instead
 of
 just
 blindly


throwing
 darts
 at
 the
 target,
 not


knowing
 where
 the
 target
 is.


>> If
 you
 had
 to
 give
 everybody
 listening


one
 relationship
 ritual
 that
 you
 would


think
 would
 most
 increase
 the


probability
 that
 they
 stay
 together,


stay
 in
 love.


>> What
 would
 that
 relationship
 ritual
 be?


>> I
 think
 that
 once
 a
 week
 you
 should
 make


a
 specific
 task
 of
 telling
 your
 partner


three
 things
 that
 you
 really
 like
 about


them.


And
 every
 week
 it
 should
 be
 something


different.
 I
 think
 you
 should
 tell
 your


partner
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to
 want
 to


take
 the
 advanced
 edition
 of
 this.
 If


you
 want
 to
 turn
 it
 from
 a
 30-
 secondond


task
 into
 like
 a
 whole
 five
 minutes
 that


you
 devote
 to
 your
 relationship,
 you


know,
 I
 feel
 about
 relationship


maintenance
 the
 way
 that
 if
 you've
 ever


heard
 the
 story,
 I
 think
 the
 Daly
 Lama


is
 the
 one
 credited
 with
 saying
 it.


That's
 that
 a
 high
 high-end
 executive,


you
 know,
 paid
 a
 colossal
 amount
 of


money
 to
 have
 a
 private
 audience
 with


the
 Daly
 Lama.
 And
 the
 Daly
 Lama
 said
 to


him,
 you
 know,
 um,
 if
 you're
 searching


for
 inner
 peace,
 you
 should
 meditate
 for


15
 minutes
 a
 day.
 And
 the
 executive


said,
 I
 don't
 have
 15
 minutes
 a
 day
 to


meditate.
 He
 said,
 then
 you
 should


meditate
 for
 an
 hour
 a
 day.
 I
 feel
 the


same
 way.
 If
 you
 don't
 have
 five
 minutes


a
 week
 to
 devote
 to
 your
 spouse
 or


partner,
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 need


hours.
 I
 think
 you
 should
 actually
 set


aside
 hours.
 Like
 five
 minutes
 a
 week,
 I


would
 suggest
 the
 following
 exact
 s
 just


systematic
 basic
 thing.
 This
 is
 what
 my


next
 book
 is
 about.
 out.
 It's
 about
 a


systematic
 approach
 to
 being
 good
 at


love.
 And
 the
 idea
 is


once
 a
 week,
 I
 think
 here's
 the
 advanced


version,
 but
 minimum
 just
 write
 down,


send
 an
 email,
 send
 a
 text,
 whatever
 it


is,
 tell
 your
 partner
 three
 things
 that


you
 love
 about
 them.


The
 advanced
 version
 is
 tell
 your


partner
 three
 things
 you
 love
 about


them.
 Tell
 them
 three
 times
 this
 week


that
 they
 made
 you
 feel
 loved.
 Here's


three
 things
 you
 did
 this
 week
 that
 made


me
 feel
 loved.
 Like
 here's
 three.
 When


you
 sent
 me
 that
 message
 and
 said
 that


made
 me
 feel
 so
 soft,
 that
 made
 me
 feel


very
 loved.
 Like
 whatever
 it
 is,
 I'm


sure
 you
 could
 find
 off
 the
 top
 of
 your


head
 three
 things
 that
 she
 did
 this
 week


that
 made
 you
 feel
 loved.
 And
 it's
 only


Monday.


>> People
 at
 home
 are
 in
 relationships


right
 now.
 They're
 hearing
 you
 say
 that


and
 some
 of
 them
 are
 still
 not
 going
 to


do
 it.
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 they're
 not


going
 to
 do
 it?
 Like
 what
 is
 that
 mental


conversation
 they're
 having
 where
 they


go?


>> I
 think
 we're
 I
 Well,
 I
 think
 we're
 I


think
 they
 think
 it's
 pointless.
 I
 think


they
 they
 might
 be
 at
 a
 point
 in
 their


relationship
 where
 it
 feels
 like
 what


would
 be
 the
 point
 we're
 so
 far
 gone
 it


wouldn't
 help.
 I
 think
 more
 than


anything
 my
 my
 real
 feeling
 on
 this
 the


secret
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 people
 want
 to


say
 out
 loud


I
 think
 we're
 terrified.
 I
 think
 we're


terrified.
 And
 I
 think
 what
 we're


terrified
 of
 is
 not


is
 not
 the
 future
 of
 our
 relationship.
 I


think
 what
 we're
 terrified
 of
 is
 that
 we


we
 feel
 like
 we're
 not
 worthy
 of
 love.
 I


think
 it's
 most
 people's
 fundamental


terror.
 I
 think
 most
 people's


fundamental
 fear
 is
 that
 if
 you
 knew
 me,


you
 wouldn't
 love
 me.
 If
 you
 could
 see


me,
 the
 real
 me,
 like
 the
 me
 that's
 in


here,
 all
 the
 weakness,
 all
 the
 fear,


all
 the
 horrible
 selfish
 thoughts,
 all


the
 perversity,
 all
 the
 all
 the
 darkest


things
 that
 are
 inside
 of
 me
 and
 every


single
 one
 of
 us
 that
 if
 you
 could
 if


you
 saw
 that,
 you
 couldn't
 possibly
 love


me.
 and


the
 feeling
 that
 comes
 with
 that
 which


is
 so
 you
 love
 the
 character
 I'm
 playing


that's
 not
 showing
 you
 all
 those
 things.


I'm
 just
 I'm
 just
 showing
 you
 the
 best


parts
 of
 myself.
 If
 you
 saw
 the
 real
 me,


you
 wouldn't
 really
 love
 me.
 I
 think
 our


greatest
 fear
 is
 that
 we're
 not
 worthy


of
 love.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 part


of
 us
 that's
 afraid
 to
 like
 poke
 at
 what


do
 you
 love
 about
 me?
 What
 do
 I
 love


about
 you?
 How
 how
 what
 am
 I
 getting


wrong?
 Like
 again,
 like
 finishing
 that


exercise,


you
 know,
 here's
 some
 things.
 Here's


three
 things
 I
 love
 about
 you.
 Here's


three
 things
 you
 did
 this
 week
 that
 made


me
 feel
 loved.
 Here's
 three
 things
 I


could
 have
 done
 better.
 Or
 tell
 me
 three


things
 I
 could
 have
 done
 better.
 Or
 tell


your
 partner
 three
 things
 they
 could


have
 done
 better.
 And
 then
 if
 you
 want


to
 have
 a
 fun
 one
 thrown
 in
 there,
 cuz
 I


think
 you
 should
 end
 on
 fun
 stuff,


here's
 three
 things
 you
 did
 this
 week


that
 made
 me
 want
 to
 have
 sex
 with
 you.


>> I
 guess
 some
 people
 would


are
 listening
 right
 now
 and
 they're


thinking,
 well,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 I'm
 dating


Barry
 or
 they
 think
 I'm
 dating
 Joanne


and
 she
 is
 she
 is
 not
 verbally
 intimate


in
 this
 way.
 She
 would,
 if
 I
 suggested


this
 to
 her,


>> write
 it
 down.
 Don't
 do
 it.
 You
 don't


have
 to
 do
 it
 verbally.
 I
 think
 verbally


is
 too
 much
 pressure
 on
 people.
 But
 but


even
 written
 down,
 if
 I
 told
 Dave
 that


we're
 going
 to
 start
 writing
 these
 notes


to
 each
 other
 about
 three
 things
 I
 love,


he's
 going
 to
 cringe
 and
 he's


>> [ __ ]
 [ __ ]
 Honestly,
 really,


that's
 that's
 too
 hard.
 It's
 too
 much
 of


an
 ask.
 Like
 Dave,
 I
 don't
 care
 what


Dave
 does
 for
 a
 living.
 Dave
 could
 be
 a


ditch
 digger
 for
 a
 living
 who's
 not


articulate
 in
 any
 way.
 Dave
 is
 moving
 in


with
 you.
 Dave
 married
 you.
 Dave
 went


out
 and
 put
 his
 money
 on
 the
 counter
 and


bought
 a
 ring.
 Dave
 Dave
 can't
 name


three
 things
 he
 likes
 about
 you.
 Really,


Dave?
 Is
 that
 a
 big
 ask?
 Is
 that
 hard,


Dave?
 Like,
 come
 on.
 That
 I
 absolutely


call
 [ __ ]
 on
 that.
 Maybe
 he
 doesn't


want
 to.
 Okay,
 that's
 a
 different


conversation.
 Why
 don't
 you
 want
 to?


Why?
 What's
 uncomfortable
 about
 that
 for


you?


>> It
 is
 uncomfortable
 for
 some
 people,


isn't
 it?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 very
 uncomfortable
 for
 some


people.


>> It's
 quite
 interesting
 that
 you
 could
 be


in
 a
 loving
 relationship
 with
 someone,


but
 also
 be
 at
 some
 deeper
 level
 scared


of
 intimacy.
 And
 I'll
 be
 honest,
 because


it's
 just
 me
 and
 you,
 nobody's


listening.


>> Sure.
 Of
 course.


>> I
 think
 at
 some
 client
 privilege.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 at
 some
 level
 I've
 always


been
 scared
 of
 intimacy.
 It
 makes
 it


sound
 more
 conscious
 than
 it
 is,


>> but
 at
 some
 deeper
 level
 I've
 always


been,
 I
 don't
 know,
 a
 bit
 disconnected


intimately
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 like


uh
 being
 able
 to
 articulate


>> these
 things.
 We
 keep
 it
 simple.
 That


that's
 why
 I
 want
 to
 keep
 that
 simple.
 I


didn't
 say
 what
 is
 what
 is
 your
 love
 for


me
 rooted
 in
 and
 what
 is
 the
 nature
 of


our
 connection
 and
 how
 does
 it
 fit
 into


the
 broader
 context
 like
 I
 had
 a
 very


challenging
 relationship
 with
 my
 mother


growing
 up
 and
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 fill
 some


of
 the
 wounds
 that
 guys
 we
 don't
 need


like
 Sigman
 Freud
 doesn't
 have
 to
 show


up
 in
 the
 relationship


what
 are
 three
 we
 could
 do
 it
 right
 now


in
 this
 relationship
 what
 are
 three


things
 I
 like
 about
 you
 what
 are
 three


experiences
 you
 and
 I
 have
 had
 with
 each


other
 that
 made
 each
 other
 laugh.
 Like


we
 have
 a
 friendship.
 Like
 what
 a
 joy


that
 is
 by
 the
 way.
 Like
 what
 a
 joy
 it


is
 to
 sit
 across
 from
 someone
 and
 say,


"You
 know what
 I
 like
 about
 you?"
 [ __ ]


man.
 I
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 that
 list.
 Like


that's
 lovely.


>> Do
 you
 think
 the
 whole
 idea
 of
 people


being
 avoidant
 and
 sort
 of
 anxious?
 You


know,
 this
 attachment
 style
 and
 stuff.


Do
 is
 that
 does
 that
 stuff
 track
 to
 what


you've
 seen?
 It
 does.
 But
 you
 know,
 I
 I


also
 think
 too
 like
 I
 don't
 understand


why
 we
 treat
 our
 connections
 to
 other


people
 differently
 than
 things
 we
 are


like
 exercise.
 Exercise.
 Okay.
 Haven't


been
 to
 the
 gym
 in
 a
 while.
 You
 go
 to


the
 gym,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 sore.
 You're


not
 going
 to
 be able
 to
 lift
 a
 lot.


You're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 start
 slow.
 And


for
 a
 couple
 days,
 you're
 going
 to
 be


sore.
 And
 if
 you
 go,
 oo,
 I
 that
 was
 I


was
 very
 sore
 after
 that.
 I'm
 not
 going


back
 to
 the
 gym.
 Okay.
 then
 you're
 never


going
 to
 get
 fit
 and
 you're
 never
 going


to
 get
 past
 the
 sore
 stage.
 Cuz
 if
 you


go,
 I'll
 wait
 a
 month
 and
 then
 I'll
 go


back
 and
 do
 the
 same
 thing
 again.
 Guess


what?
 You're
 just
 going
 to
 You
 have
 to


move
 through
 the
 uncomfortable
 part
 to


get
 to
 the
 part
 where
 it
 starts
 to
 feel


really
 good
 and
 you're
 not
 as
 sore.


Yeah,
 you'll
 sometimes
 still
 be
 sore.


You
 pushed
 it
 a
 little
 too
 hard.
 Maybe


worked
 out
 with
 Huberman
 that
 week.
 But


you
 know what?
 Other
 weeks
 like
 you
 go,


"Hey,
 I
 don't
 feel
 sore.
 I
 just
 feel


strong
 and
 healthy."
 So,
 there's
 going


to
 be
 moments
 where
 this
 might
 feel
 a


little
 weird.
 It
 might
 feel
 a
 little


awkward.
 It
 might
 feel
 a
 little
 sore.


There
 might
 be
 weeks
 where
 that
 kind
 of


a
 simple
 little
 practice
 feels
 a
 little


like,
 oh,
 it
 feels
 a
 little


uncomfortable.
 Or,
 yeah,
 the
 list
 of


things
 that
 you
 did
 this
 week
 that
 made


me
 feel
 loved,
 I
 have
 to
 reach
 for
 it.


Okay,
 great.
 Isn't
 that
 little


uncomfortable
 conversation
 that
 might


prevent
 slippage?
 Isn't
 that
 little


conversation
 better
 than
 the
 long-term


impact
 of
 having
 a
 distance
 start


growing
 between
 the
 two
 of
 you
 that


eventually
 becomes
 impossible
 to


navigate
 because
 it
 becomes
 a
 chasm


between
 the
 two
 of
 you?


>> Do
 you
 think
 the
 attachment
 style
 theory


has
 any
 truth
 to
 it
 from
 what
 you've


seen?
 Do
 you
 tend
 to
 find
 people
 are,


you
 know,
 there's
 some
 people
 that
 are


avoidant
 of
 intimacy,
 there's
 some


people
 that
 are
 anxious,
 there's
 some


people
 in
 the
 middle.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 we're


all
 creatures
 of
 our
 our
 upbringing,
 and


I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 I'm
 amazed
 as
 a


53-year-old
 man
 in
 therapy
 how
 often


a
 lot
 of
 my
 challenges
 are
 rooted
 in


seven-year-old
 Jim.


>> As
 a
 man
 that
 talks
 so
 much
 about
 love,


I'm
 I'm
 curious
 to
 know
 what
 it
 is
 that


you
 still
 struggle
 with
 in
 terms
 of,
 you


know,
 because
 I
 I
 mean,
 I
 know
 from
 my


own
 experience
 that
 I
 can
 know
 every
 I


can
 know
 so
 much.
 I
 sit
 here
 with


experts
 all
 day
 every
 day.
 It's
 not
 like


I
 don't
 know
 this
 stuff.
 Yeah.


>> But
 then
 putting
 it
 into
 practice
 is
 a


different
 task.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 why
 you'll
 never
 hear


me
 use
 myself
 in
 my
 relationships
 as
 an


example
 because
 I
 think
 you
 can
 be,
 you


know,
 an
 incredibly
 skilled
 person
 at
 at


the
 theory
 of
 something
 and
 then
 in
 its


practical
 application,
 you
 have
 your
 own


unique
 challenges.
 I
 think
 that
 using


yourself
 as
 the
 example
 and
 your


relationships
 as
 an
 example
 is
 dangerous


because
 I
 I
 learned
 it
 in
 my
 own


professional
 life
 when
 I
 had
 a
 very


friendly
 divorce.
 And
 so
 my
 experience


of
 divorce
 is
 the
 unique
 function
 of
 the


constitution
 of
 my
 ex-wife
 and
 of
 me
 and


of
 our
 unique
 circumstances
 that
 brought


us
 where
 we
 are.
 So
 if
 I
 use
 that
 as
 the


basis
 for
 my
 analysis
 of
 things,
 I
 think


it's
 a
 very
 shallow
 sample
 size.
 I
 I


know
 for
 me


my
 greatest
 challenge
 in
 every


relationship
 I've
 ever
 had,
 but
 even
 in


my
 my
 professional
 relationships
 is


acknowledging
 when
 I
 need
 help.
 I
 I


think
 because
 I
 was
 raised
 in
 an


environment
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 needs


weren't
 met.
 My
 father
 was
 a
 very


serious
 alcoholic.
 My
 mother
 was
 trying


to
 tend
 to
 a
 very
 serious
 alcoholic.


when
 I
 needed
 something
 even
 from
 a
 very


young
 age
 I
 I
 felt
 a
 lot
 of
 shame


because
 it
 wasn't
 met
 with
 you
 know
 I'm


hungry
 for
 breakfast
 like
 of
 course
 let


me
 make
 you
 some
 breakfast
 it
 was
 met


with
 what
 you
 can't
 make
 your
 own


breakfast
 what's
 wrong
 with
 you
 and
 I


it
 was
 this
 guy
 yeah
 that
 was
 me
 that


was
 me
 Bruce
 Lee
 poster
 and
 my
 was
 Chuck


Norris
 up
 there
 um
 yeah
 this
 is
 probably


like


nine
 nine
 years
 old
 Okinawa
 and
 Goju
 Ryu


karate.
 This
 is
 my
 room.
 Yeah,
 I
 was


very
 um
 very
 lonely.
 I
 was
 really


lonely.
 I
 was
 really
 sad.
 And


um
 I
 loved
 martial
 arts
 because
 there


was
 this


very
 clear
 kind
 of
 masculinity
 on


display,
 like
 this
 protective,
 strong


superpower
 that
 you
 could
 build.


>> It
 wasn't
 just
 gifted
 to
 you.
 like
 you


didn't
 win
 the
 genetic
 lottery.
 Like
 you


could
 through
 discipline
 and
 practice


you
 could
 have
 this
 superpower
 that


would
 make
 you
 feel
 safe
 and
 and
 that


was
 what
 I
 obsessed
 about
 having.


There's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 that
 person


that
 young
 man
 still
 in
 me
 that
 is


afraid
 to
 ask
 for
 help.
 I
 wanted
 to
 be


someone
 who
 I
 could
 do
 do
 it
 all
 for


myself.


And
 I
 I I
 wish
 I
 could
 say
 looking
 back


that
 it
 was
 because
 that
 was
 my
 natural


proclivity
 is
 to
 want
 to
 be
 very


self-actualized,
 but
 it
 really
 was
 that


I
 was
 just
 absolutely
 sad
 and
 terrified


that
 if
 I
 asked
 I'd
 be
 shamed
 if
 I
 said


like
 could
 you
 be
 nice
 to
 me
 that
 the


answer
 would
 be
 no.


So
 I
 learned
 how
 to
 do
 everything
 like
 I


cook
 amazingly
 well.
 like
 I'm
 good
 at
 a


lot
 of
 things.
 I'm
 good
 at
 most
 things.


Almost
 anything
 I
 put
 my
 mind
 to
 I'm


good
 at.
 But
 it
 took
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 years


to
 figure
 out
 that
 that
 although
 that


has
 served
 me
 really
 well
 and
 it's
 built


my
 career
 and
 the
 security
 and
 safety


that
 came
 with
 being
 so
 successful
 and


having
 financial
 success
 and
 you
 know


now
 some
 level
 of
 notoriety.


It
 took
 me
 a
 long
 time
 to
 figure
 out


that
 that
 also
 has
 been
 the
 greatest


obstacle
 in
 my
 life.
 And
 I
 it
 it
 I'm


learning
 at
 the
 age
 of
 53
 that
 this
 guy


is
 like
 he's
 still
 there
 and
 talking
 to


me
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 I've
 learned
 now


again
 through
 my
 own
 therapy
 to
 say
 to


him
 like,
 "Oh,
 I
 hear
 you.
 Like,
 I
 hear


you.
 I'm
 glad
 you're
 still
 there.
 Like,


you
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 so
 scared
 anymore.


I'm
 not


I'm
 grateful
 to
 him.


I
 think
 that's
 the
 best
 thing
 to
 aspire


to
 is
 to
 make
 peace
 with
 that.
 Like
 I'm


sure
 in
 you


there
 is
 some
 little
 boy


like
 hiding
 in
 some
 part
 of
 his
 room


feeling
 very
 lost
 and
 very
 lonely.
 And
 I


don't
 think
 there's
 anything
 wrong
 or


weak
 or
 not
 masculine
 or
 not
 strong


about
 acknowledging
 that
 that's
 still
 a


voice
 in
 your
 head.


And
 acknowledging
 that
 that
 voice
 in


your
 head,
 like
 it
 it
 brought
 you
 where


you
 are,
 but
 it
 also
 held
 you
 back
 in


some
 ways.
 And
 you're
 never
 going
 to
 get


rid
 of
 it.
 But
 maybe
 what
 you'll
 do
 is


hear
 it
 for
 what
 it
 is,
 which
 is
 is
 it's


a
 voice
 that
 was
 once
 there
 really


important
 to
 save
 you.
 and
 it
 did
 a


really
 good
 job
 of
 that.
 But
 that
 it's


okay.
 Like
 it's
 okay.
 You
 don't
 have
 to


beat
 that
 out
 of
 you,
 but
 you
 don't
 have


to
 listen
 to
 it
 either.
 You
 don't
 have


to
 let
 it
 drive
 the
 car.


>> I
 was
 thinking
 as
 you
 were
 speaking


about
 how
 those
 of
 us
 that
 Do
 you
 want


me
 to
 take
 this
 foot
 back?


>> Oh,
 but
 it's
 great.
 It's
 fun
 to
 see
 that


guy.
 I
 It's
 funny
 that
 you
 you
 pulled


that
 out.
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 you,
 I
 I
 It's
 a


lovely
 It's
 a
 lovely
 thing.


I
 think
 there's
 something
 to
 learn
 from


those
 versions
 of
 oursel.


Like
 if
 you
 hang
 out
 with
 kids,


you
 you
 just
 see
 like


>> they
 don't
 have
 all
 that
 hate
 in
 their


heart.
 They
 hate
 naps.
 It's
 the
 end
 of


the
 list.
 Like
 everything
 else
 like
 they


just
 want
 to
 like
 love
 each
 other
 and


hug
 each
 other
 and
 play.
 And
 when
 they


like
 think
 they
 hurt
 someone,
 they
 stop


and
 they're
 very
 scared
 cuz
 they
 didn't


mean
 to.
 And
 then
 we
 turn
 into
 these


creatures
 that
 are
 just
 attacking
 each


other
 all
 the
 time,
 you
 know?
 And
 I


think
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 like
 all
 we


want
 is
 that.
 Like
 all
 we
 want
 is
 to


just
 be
 like
 that
 warm,
 open
 version
 of


ourselves
 before
 the
 world
 beat
 the
 [ __ ]


out
 of
 us.
 And
 maybe
 that's
 what
 love's


supposed
 to
 be.
 Like
 maybe
 what
 love
 is


is
 an
 opportunity
 for
 us
 to
 like


reconnect
 to
 that
 part
 of
 ourselves
 that


was
 just
 so
 simple.
 Like
 I
 just
 want
 you


to
 love
 me.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 loved
 by
 you.
 I


want
 you
 to
 feel
 worthy
 of
 my
 love.
 I


want
 to
 feel
 worthy
 of
 yours.
 Like,
 why


does
 it
 have
 to
 be
 so
 hard?


So
 many
 of
 us
 are
 pursuing
 passive
 forms


of
 income
 and
 to
 build
 side
 businesses


in
 order
 to
 help
 us
 cover
 our
 bills.

 opportunity

There's
 a
 phase
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 hit


where
 they're
 no
 longer
 doing
 the
 most


important
 thing,
 which
 is
 selling,
 and


they
 get
 really
 bogged
 down
 with
 admin.


And
 it's
 often
 something
 that
 creeps
 up


slowly,
 and
 you
 don't
 really
 notice


until
 it's
 happened.
 Slowly,
 momentum


starts
 to
 leak
 out.
 This
 happened
 to
 us,


and
 our
 sponsor,
 Pipe
 Drive,
 was
 a
 fix
 I


came
 across
 10
 years
 ago.
 And
 ever


since,
 my
 teams
 across
 my
 different


companies
 have
 continued
 to
 use
 it.
 Pipe


Drive
 is
 a
 simple
 but
 powerful
 sales
 CRM


that
 gives
 you
 the
 visibility
 on
 any


deals
 in
 your
 pipeline.
 It
 also


automates
 a
 lot
 of the
 tedious,


repetitive,
 and
 time-conuming
 parts
 of


the
 sales
 process,
 which
 in
 turn
 saves


you
 so
 many
 hours
 every
 single
 month,


which
 means
 you
 can
 get
 back
 to
 selling.


Making
 that
 early
 decision
 to
 switch
 to


Pipe
 Drive
 was
 a
 real
 gamecher,
 and
 it's


kept
 the
 right
 things
 front
 of
 mind.
 My


favorite
 feature
 is
 Pipe
 Drive's
 ability


to
 sync
 your
 CRM
 with
 multiple
 email


inboxes
 so
 your
 entire
 team
 can
 work


together
 from
 one
 platform.
 And
 we


aren't
 the
 only
 ones
 benefiting.
 Over


100,000
 companies
 use
 Pipe
 Drive
 to
 grow


their
 business.

I
 was
 thinking
 about
 how
 um
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 people
 that
 at
 a
 very
 early
 age


had
 to
 be
 very
 independent
 for
 whatever


reason.
 Maybe
 a
 parent
 wasn't
 around.


Maybe
 in
 your
 case,
 you
 know,
 I've


heard,
 you
 know,
 doing
 this
 podcast,
 you


get
 a
 bit
 of
 pattern
 recognition
 where


you
 you
 sometimes
 think,
 oh,
 okay,
 so
 if


one
 of
 the
 parents
 was
 an
 alcoholic,


>> adult
 children
 of
 alcoholics
 were
 were
 I


remember
 reading
 the
 book
 recovery,


adult
 children
 of
 alcoholics,
 I
 stumbled


on
 it
 when
 I
 was
 in
 college
 in
 a


bookstore
 and
 I
 remember
 reading
 it
 and


going,
 have
 they
 been
 reading
 my
 diary?


Like
 what
 the
 holy
 because
 there
 was


this
 profile
 of
 like
 one
 of
 the
 types


one
 of
 the
 archetypes
 of
 adult
 children


of
 alcoholics
 is
 that
 you
 yeah
 control


control


like
 wanting
 to
 control
 everything


because
 life
 feels
 so
 chaotic
 when
 you


live
 with
 an
 alcoholic.
 When
 the
 person


who
 is
 supposed
 to
 be
 your
 primary


caregiver
 and
 the
 primary
 mechanism
 for


you
 to
 feel
 safe
 feels
 unpredictable
 and


chaotic
 and
 that
 is
 that
 creates
 in
 you


this
 constant
 sense
 of
 a
 heightened
 you


know
 heightened
 sense
 of
 I
 need
 to
 hold


on
 as
 tight
 as
 I
 can
 and
 also
 that
 drove


you
 to
 be
 incredibly
 independent.


>> Yeah.


Independence
 and
 connection
 seem
 to
 be


on
 like
 two
 ends
 of
 the
 spectrum.
 And
 I


say
 this
 in
 part
 because
 I
 look
 at


>> I
 look
 at
 all
 my
 friends
 that
 are
 very


very
 very
 independent
 and
 I
 would
 say


that
 they
 typically
 struggle
 the
 most
 to


form
 relationships
 because
 they've
 kind


of
 built
 their
 own


>> castle
 with
 a
 moat.


>> Yeah.


And
 generally
 if
 we
 zoom
 out
 on
 this


point
 of
 independence
 and
 dependency


>> I
 would
 say
 that
 the
 narrative
 in


society
 over
 the
 last
 I
 know
 10
 20
 years


or
 whatever
 has
 been


>> pointed
 at
 glorifying
 independence
 and


not
 dependency.
 Dependency
 is
 like
 not


cool.
 It's
 like
 be
 your
 own
 boss
 start


your own
 business
 down
 on
 your
 own
 two


feet.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 so
 I
 used
 to
 view


I
 would
 say
 the
 defining
 characteristics


of
 my
 30s
 and
 40s


was
 the
 belief
 that
 there
 were
 two


versions
 of
 Jim
 Sexton.


One
 was
 the
 one
 that
 was
 the
 most


forward-
 facing
 at
 that
 time
 which
 was


lead
 pipe
 cruelty
 and
 mercenary


sensibility.
 Like
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to


do
 this
 job.
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 it
 really


well.
 I'm
 going
 to
 get
 better
 and
 better


at
 it.
 I'm
 going
 to
 just
 take
 my
 skill


set
 and
 weaponize
 it
 and
 that's
 who
 I'm


going
 to
 be.
 And
 then
 there
 was
 this


other
 part
 of
 me
 that
 was
 always
 there.


I
 kind
 of
 stuffed
 it
 in
 the
 closet
 for
 a


while
 that
 like
 gets
 misty
 eyed
 when
 I


talk
 about
 love
 and
 cries
 when
 I
 think


about
 dogs
 and,
 you
 know,
 watches
 Love


on
 the
 Spectrum
 and
 can't
 make
 it


through
 an
 episode
 without
 weeping
 three


or
 four
 times.
 Like
 this
 very
 soft,


gentle,
 loving,
 compassionate,


empathetic,
 sensitive
 part
 of
 me.
 And
 I


felt
 like
 they
 were
 two
 waring
 forces.


There
 were
 two
 versions
 of
 me.
 And
 the


question
 was,
 how
 can
 I
 beat
 that
 soft


little,
 you
 know,
 wuss
 out
 of
 me
 and
 be


the
 final
 form,
 which
 is
 like
 the
 me


that's
 a
 machine
 that
 can
 just
 do
 it


like
 that
 can
 just
 do
 what
 needs
 to
 be


done
 and
 do
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that
 nobody
 else


can
 do.
 And
 I'm
 very
 blessed
 that
 I
 am


in
 my
 line
 of
 work.
 what
 yoyo
 ma
 is
 in


cello
 like
 in
 a
 courtroom


I
 have
 a
 god-given
 talent
 and
 I
 remember


thinking
 okay
 that's
 the
 final
 form
 of


me
 is
 a
 master
 in
 the
 courtroom
 and
 and


everything
 else
 is
 just
 what
 do
 I
 need


to
 do
 to
 get
 there
 I
 remember
 my
 ex-wife


saying
 to
 me
 you
 know
 you
 will
 never


love
 any
 woman
 as
 much
 as
 you
 love
 the


law
 like
 every
 woman
 who
 you
 ever
 meet


for
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 life
 will
 be


playing
 second
 fiddle
 to
 how
 much
 you


love
 being
 in
 a
 courtroom.
 You're
 great


in
 a
 courtroom
 and
 you
 have
 no
 idea
 what


to
 do
 in
 your
 living
 room.
 Like
 in
 your


living
 room,
 you're
 just
 totally


paralyzed.
 Whereas
 in
 a
 courtroom,
 you


know
 every
 it
 has
 why
 it
 has
 defined


rules.
 It
 has
 a
 cadence.
 I
 know
 what
 the


goal
 is.
 Like
 I
 know
 exact
 it's


controlled
 chaos.
 I'm
 great
 at
 it.
 So


there
 was
 a
 part
 of
 me
 that
 went,
 okay,


there's
 this
 soft,
 warm,
 wonderful,


lovely,
 empathetic
 side
 of
 me,
 and
 then


there's
 this
 real
 successful,
 and
 that's


the
 one
 that
 got
 me
 everywhere.
 That's


the
 one
 that
 got
 me
 everything
 I
 have.


So
 I
 have
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 get
 rid


of
 this
 one
 and
 keep
 this
 one.
 Like,


and
 for
 my
 entire
 30s
 and
 most
 of
 my


40s,
 that
 was
 my
 primary
 thing
 was


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 get
 rid
 of


that
 part
 of
 me.
 And
 no
 matter
 how


loudly
 I
 blared
 9-in
 nails
 on
 on
 on
 on


my
 headphones
 and
 tried
 to
 become
 a


machine,
 I
 couldn't
 get
 rid
 of
 that
 part


of
 me.
 And
 then
 I
 came
 to
 realize,
 I


think
 in
 part
 because
 of
 this
 work.
 I


think
 because
 of
 like
 somehow
 I
 stumbled


into


being
 in
 a
 position
 where
 I
 end
 up


talking
 about
 feelings
 a
 whole
 lot.
 And


it's
 somehow
 I
 I
 I
 got
 brought
 in
 to


have
 go
 here's
 this
 interesting
 divorce


lawyer
 who's
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 divorce


stuff
 and
 somehow
 ended
 up
 talking
 a
 lot


about
 love
 and
 softness
 and
 warmth
 and


compassion.


>> I
 didn't
 think
 it
 somehow


>> Yeah.
 No,
 exactly.
 And
 what
 I
 came
 to


learn
 from
 that
 from
 from
 giving
 that


voice


is
 that
 there
 actually
 isn't
 two
 waring


forces.
 It's
 two
 very
 authentic
 aspects


of
 self
 that
 have
 to
 exist
 inside
 of
 me.


And
 each
 one
 of
 them
 creates
 the
 other


in
 some
 ways.
 Like
 I
 don't
 think
 I'd
 be


anywhere
 near
 as
 good
 of
 a
 lawyer
 and


courtroom
 advocate
 if
 I
 didn't
 have
 a


tremendous
 sensitivity
 and
 empathy
 and


couldn't
 put
 myself
 in
 the
 heads
 of
 the


various
 people
 in
 the
 room.
 So
 I
 think


that
 when
 we
 start
 to
 see
 what
 seems


like
 opposite
 traits
 in
 us
 instead
 as


authentic
 representations
 of
 aspects
 of


who
 we
 are
 that
 we
 have
 to
 learn
 how
 to


do
 let
 them
 dance,
 let
 them
 move


together
 in
 some
 way.
 And
 there's
 times


where
 this
 guy
 should
 take
 the
 lead.
 And


there's
 times
 where
 that
 very
 focused


self
 that
 you
 know
 is
 very


missiondriven,
 that
 person
 should
 lead.


And
 and
 for
 men
 in
 particular,
 like


we've
 been
 taught
 a
 rigidity.
 Like
 the


gender
 role
 for
 men
 has
 a
 tremendous


rigidity.
 I
 mean,
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 time


where
 you
 either
 got
 to
 be
 Clint


Eastwood
 or
 Richard
 Simmons.
 Those
 were


your
 two
 choices.
 You
 either
 had
 to
 be,


you
 know,
 like
 icy
 100%
 or
 you
 had
 to


be,
 you
 know,
 you
 could
 be
 warm
 and


fuzzy,
 but
 then
 you
 were
 just
 not
 really


masculine.
 And
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 that's


the
 case.
 Like
 you
 look
 at
 like
 I've


spent
 20
 years
 on
 the
 Brazilian


jiu-jitsu
 mat.
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 you
 like


there
 are
 some
 dudes
 could
 snap
 your


neck
 with
 like
 any
 with
 their
 thumb
 and


they're
 some
 of
 the
 warmest
 most
 lovely


people
 because
 these
 are
 all
 authentic


aspects
 of
 self.
 And
 to
 know
 that
 like


the
 soft
 warm
 version
 of
 me
 feeding
 it,


letting
 it
 spend
 some
 time
 letting
 it
 be


in
 conversation,
 it
 it
 makes
 me
 better


at
 the
 other
 part.
 It
 makes
 me
 more


authentic.
 It
 makes
 me
 better
 at
 that


part.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 letting
 that
 part


out,
 it
 hasn't
 done
 anything
 to
 diminish


this
 part.
 So
 when
 you
 start
 to
 see
 it


that
 way,
 I
 I
 really
 think
 that
 there's


a
 tremendous


broader
 menu
 of
 possibilities
 out
 there.


I've
 got
 several
 friends
 in
 my
 life
 that


have
 really
 struggled
 with
 relationships


and
 love.
 And
 uh
 for
 all
 those
 people


that
 have
 really
 really
 struggled
 in


love
 and
 they
 look
 around
 at
 everybody


else
 and
 everybody
 else
 seems
 to
 have


worked
 it
 out
 or
 at least
 be
 working


through
 a
 situation
 but
 they
 look
 at


themselves
 and
 go,
 "It
 just
 doesn't
 work


for
 me.
 What's
 going
 on?
 Why
 am
 I
 the


only
 one
 in
 my
 friendship
 group
 that


hasn't
 found
 love
 or
 isn't
 in
 a


relationship?"
 And
 they
 kind
 of
 beat


themselves
 up
 about
 it.
 I
 think
 that's
 a


great
 starting
 point.
 Why
 is
 this


happening
 to
 me?
 and
 start
 looking
 at


when
 did
 it
 start
 happening
 and
 what's


the
 consistent
 thread
 through
 all
 of
 it


and
 are
 there
 people
 that
 I
 could
 ask


that
 question
 of
 who
 know
 me
 and
 love
 me


and
 would
 be
 willing
 to
 tell
 me
 honestly


and
 if
 there
 aren't
 great
 what
 are
 some


resources
 out
 there
 in
 terms
 of
 the


wisdom
 of
 other
 people
 that
 might
 share


that
 experience
 I
 think
 there's
 so
 many


entry
 points
 to
 that
 conversation
 with


yourself
 I
 think
 the
 start
 is
 to


identify
 that
 yeah
 I'm
 drowning
 like


what
 here's
 what
 the
 solution
 is
 not
 is


to
 pretend
 everything's
 fine.
 And
 that's


the
 ecosystem
 we've
 created.


We're
 we're
 living
 our
 gag
 reel
 and


watching
 everyone's
 greatest
 hits.
 And


we're
 encouraged
 all
 day
 long
 to
 tell


everyone
 how
 great
 we're
 doing
 and
 how


we're
 crushing
 it
 and
 how
 great
 we
 feel


and
 how
 focused
 we
 are.
 Because
 why?


Because
 we're
 terrified
 that
 if
 we
 said,


"I
 don't
 know.
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 drowning.


I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 drowning
 sometimes.
 I


have
 moments
 where
 I
 feel
 so
 put


together
 and
 then
 I
 have
 moments
 where
 I


think
 I'm
 drowning.
 And
 and
 by
 the
 way,


when
 people
 have
 that
 kind
 of
 honesty,


there's
 something
 so
 beautiful
 about
 it.


Like
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 you,
 like
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 people
 say
 about
 me
 when
 I


go,
 I
 don't
 understand
 why
 anything
 I'm


saying
 resonates
 with
 anybody.
 People


are
 like,
 "Dude,
 you're
 so
 real.
 It's
 so


real.
 It's
 so
 blunt
 and
 honest
 and
 like


real."
 This
 is
 it's
 in
 every
 one
 of
 us


is
 that
 same
 realness,
 that
 same
 basic


just
 all
 it
 is
 is
 just
 saying
 out
 loud


like,
 "Yeah,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't
 know.


Like,
 I
 don't
 have
 it
 all
 figured
 out."


AND
 THAT'S
 OKAY
 CUZ
 I
 HAVE
 SOME
 THINGS


really
 figured
 out.
 So
 maybe
 if
 I've
 got


these
 things
 really
 figured
 out
 and


you've
 got
 these
 other
 things
 really


figured
 out
 and
 we're
 just
 stop


bullshitting
 each
 other
 for
 five
 minutes


and
 instead
 go,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 doing


great
 on
 this,
 but
 like
 this
 I
 feel
 like


I'm
 a
 train
 wreck
 on.
 Like
 every
 high


achieving
 friend
 I
 have,
 every
 celebrity


friend
 I
 have,
 every
 per
 I
 have
 friends


who
 people
 look
 at
 them
 and
 go,
 "Oh,


dude,
 he
 is
 murdering
 it."
 Like
 you're


my
 friend.
 People
 look
 at
 you,
 they
 go,


"He's
 murdering
 it."
 There
 are
 aspects


of
 your
 life
 that
 you're
 like,
 "I
 got
 to


work
 on
 that."
 There's
 tons
 of
 aspects


of
 my
 life
 where
 I
 go,
 I
 got
 to
 work
 on


that.
 Like
 I
 I
 figured
 all
 these
 other


things
 out,
 but
 I
 haven't
 figured
 that


out
 yet.
 And
 you
 know what?
 It's
 so


lovely
 to
 have
 that
 conversation.
 Like


why
 why
 can't
 we
 just
 make
 some
 space


for
 that
 all
 of
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 more?
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 that
 hard.


It's
 at least
 as
 important
 as
 our


workout
 routine.
 It's
 at least
 as


important
 as
 remembering
 someone's


birthday.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 I
 wonder
 why
 that
 I
 wonder
 why


it
 is
 that
 we
 um
 there's
 so
 little
 space


for
 us
 to
 work
 on
 our
 connection


challenges


these
 days.


>> It
 hasn't
 been
 prioritized.
 We
 become


what
 we
 behold.
 We
 prioritize
 what
 we've


been
 told
 to
 prioritize.
 We've
 been
 told


to
 prioritize
 conspicuous
 consumption.


>> We've
 been
 taught
 that
 the
 measure
 of
 a


person
 is
 is
 how
 much
 financial
 success


they
 have.
 That's
 why
 I
 genuinely


believe
 that
 if
 we
 continue
 to
 barrel


along


using
 this
 the
 metric
 of
 success
 being


financial
 above
 all
 else
 really


consumption,
 what
 we
 own,
 what
 we
 wear,


what
 we
 have
 or
 how
 we
 look,
 right?
 as


the
 priority,
 we're
 barreling
 towards


nothing.
 Whereas
 if
 we
 were
 to
 change


that
 and
 say,
 hey,
 like
 joy,
 peace,


finding
 some
 peace
 within
 ourselves,


finding
 some
 balance
 that
 feels
 right
 to


us
 individually.


>> I
 think
 that's
 a
 really
 good
 simple
 word


which
 people
 don't
 think
 about
 enough


when
 they're
 thinking
 about
 the
 KPIs
 of


success
 in
 their
 life,
 which
 is
 how
 do
 I


feel?
 And
 I
 think
 we've
 all
 grown
 up
 in


different
 contexts
 learning
 to
 tune
 out


of
 how
 I
 feel
 and
 in
 its
 place
 put
 how


does
 the
 world
 feel
 about
 me
 as
 like
 the


primary
 metric.
 And
 it's
 like
 I
 I
 was


thinking
 the
 other
 day
 that
 actually,


you
 know,
 we
 can
 go
 do
 all
 these


podcasts
 and
 books
 and
 whatever
 else,


but
 we
 were
 all
 born
 with
 this
 sort
 of


internal
 compass
 that
 tells
 you
 every


day
 how
 you
 feel,
 but
 like
 none
 of
 us


tune
 into
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 actually
 the
 metric


becomes
 like
 how
 many
 followers
 do
 you


have?
 How
 rich
 are
 you?
 How


>> it's
 beaten
 out
 of
 us
 by
 the
 world.
 Like


I
 I
 I
 will
 tell
 you,
 you
 always
 get
 the


most
 emotional
 stuff
 out
 of
 me,
 Stephen.


I
 will
 tell
 you
 my
 most
 shameful
 moment


as
 a
 parent.


So
 I
 have
 two
 sons.
 They're
 26
 and
 28.


28-year-old
 just
 got
 married
 in


September.
 He's
 a
 lawyer.
 He's
 awesome.


He
 must
 have
 been
 five
 or
 six.


and
 something
 happened


like
 and
 he
 was
 he
 started
 crying
 like


someone
 hurt
 his
 feelings
 or
 something


happened
 but
 it
 wasn't
 I
 don't know
 it


wasn't
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal
 like
 it
 it
 to


me
 at
 the
 moment
 I
 mean
 I
 was
 in
 my
 20s


he
 was
 24
 when
 I
 I
 was
 24
 when
 he
 was


born
 so
 yeah
 I
 was
 in
 my
 20s
 and
 he
 was


crying
 he
 was
 crying
 and
 like
 I
 wanted


him
 to
 stop
 crying
 because
 it
 made
 me


sad
 to
 see
 him
 cry
 like
 I
 love
 him
 so


much
 like
 that
 I
 was
 like
 it
 made
 me
 so


uncomfortable
 able
 to
 see
 him
 crying.


And
 I
 remember
 I
 like
 I
 like
 grabbed


him,
 not
 roughly,
 I
 grabbed
 him
 and
 I


just
 looked
 at
 him
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Control
 yourself."
 I'm
 like, "Control


yourself."
 I'm
 like, "Calm
 down
 and


control
 yourself."


And
 I
 remember
 like
 he
 he
 managed
 to
 do


it.


It's
 20some
 years
 later.
 Like,
 and
 I
 I'm


ashamed
 of
 that
 moment.


because
 I
 understand
 what
 I
 was
 trying


to
 say
 to
 him.
 Like
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 say


to
 him,
 I
 I
 don't
 want
 you
 to
 be
 in


pain.
 Like
 I'm
 uncomfortable
 with
 your


pain.
 I
 also
 wanted
 I
 wanted
 to
 say


something
 to
 this
 guy
 probably
 which
 is


like
 dude
 like
 the
 world's
 not
 going
 to


be
 nice
 to
 you
 if
 it
 knows
 that
 you
 have


all
 these
 feelings.
 Like
 you
 got
 to
 find


a
 way
 to
 hide
 it.
 There's
 so
 much
 going


on
 in
 that
 moment.
 But
 like
 I
 look
 back


on
 that
 moment
 and
 I
 just
 think
 like


no
 like
 that
 was
 the
 wrong
 thing
 to
 do.


Like
 it
 was
 the
 wrong
 thing
 to
 do.
 Like


I
 don't
 think
 we
 should
 be
 telling


people
 not
 just
 boys
 like
 boys


particularly
 maybe.
 But
 I
 don't
 think
 we


should
 be
 telling
 people
 like
 control


yourself.
 Like
 stop
 feeling
 so
 much.


Like
 I
 think
 I
 think


I
 think
 there's
 a
 difference
 between


trying
 to
 like
 get
 people
 to
 control


their
 feelings
 and
 not
 letting
 like


everything
 be
 governed
 by
 the
 transient


feelings
 that
 you
 have
 from
 moment
 to


moment.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 harder
 more


subtle
 message.
 But
 like
 I
 think
 fe
 if


we
 lead
 with
 the
 feelings,
 if
 we
 lean


into
 the
 feelings
 first,
 if
 we
 identify


the
 feelings
 first,
 if
 we
 figure
 out


what
 it
 is
 we
 want
 to
 feel,
 we
 want
 the


other
 person
 to
 feel
 to
 bring
 it
 back
 to


marriage
 to
 bring
 it
 back
 to
 connection


that
 what
 were
 the
 questions
 I
 was


asking
 earlier
 that
 that
 exercise.
 When


did
 I
 make
 you
 feel
 loved
 this
 week?


Here's
 some
 things
 you
 did
 that
 made
 me


feel
 loved
 this
 week.
 Here's
 some
 things


that
 made
 me
 feel
 desire
 towards
 you


this
 week.
 Here's
 some
 things
 you
 did


this
 week
 that
 made
 me
 feel
 less
 than


loved
 by
 you
 or
 that
 made
 me
 feel
 less


connected
 to
 you.
 Like
 what?
 Maybe
 we


just
 need
 to
 help
 each
 other
 learn


how
 to
 identify
 our
 feelings
 and
 feel


our
 feelings.
 Like
 maybe
 we
 need
 more


Mr.
 Rogers
 and
 less,
 you
 know,
 intense


self-help.
 Like
 maybe
 we
 just
 need
 more


help
 not
 trying
 to
 control
 our
 feelings,


but
 just
 figure
 out
 what
 they
 are
 and


feel
 them.
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


us
 are
 distracting
 ourselves
 as
 a
 way
 to


avoid
 feeling
 anything
 because
 even
 I


was
 thinking
 about
 like
 a
 practical
 way


for
 you
 to
 get
 back
 in
 touch
 with


actually
 how
 you're
 feeling.
 Yeah.


>> And
 every
 solution
 I
 came
 up
 with
 was


like
 interrupted
 by
 doom.


>> Well,
 the
 best
 definition
 of
 addiction


I've
 ever
 heard
 was
 from
 a
 therapist


Dave
 Klugman


>> who
 said
 to
 me,
 um,
 addiction
 is


anything
 you
 do
 to
 get
 away
 from
 feeling


what
 you
 would
 would
 have
 felt
 if
 you'd


done
 nothing
 at
 all.
 And
 I've
 always


said
 to
 people,
 work
 is
 my
 favorite


narcotic.


Like
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 most
 productive


times
 in
 my
 life,
 they
 were
 almost


always
 when
 something
 awful
 was


happening
 in
 my
 personal
 life.
 Either
 I


was
 getting
 divorced,
 my
 mother
 was


dying,
 some
 some
 painful
 thing
 was


happening.
 So
 I
 took
 tremendous
 comfort


in
 feeling
 in
 control
 and
 competent,


which
 is
 how
 I
 feel
 at
 work.
 So
 the
 the


more
 I'm
 working
 is
 usually
 a
 gauge
 of


of
 where
 there
 are
 aspects
 of
 my
 life


that
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 feel
 certain


things.
 And
 again,
 that's
 why
 I
 think


that
 the
 the
 best
 question
 to
 ask
 at
 the


start
 of
 therapy,
 the
 only
 question


really,
 is
 what
 is
 it
 I'm
 afraid
 to


feel?


I
 think
 because
 we're
 closing
 off
 on


this
 section
 where
 we
 were
 talking
 about


people
 who
 have
 struggled
 in
 love,
 it
 is


probably
 worth
 just
 closing
 the
 section


by


giving
 them


a
 why
 as
 to


like
 the
 the
 reason
 why
 they
 should
 take


love
 seriously
 and
 stop
 distracting


themselves
 and
 stop
 avoiding
 it
 and
 stop


avoiding
 going
 to
 therapy,


>> brushing
 it
 under
 the
 carpet.


like
 what
 what
 is
 what
 is
 the
 why
 there?


Why
 should
 they
 take
 love
 seriously?


Because
 they
 could
 continue
 to,
 you


know,
 bomb
 on
 for
 the
 next
 10,
 20
 years


and
 become


>> really
 professionally
 accomplished.


>> Mhm.


>> And,
 you
 know,
 get
 rich,
 nice
 house,


nice
 holidays.


>> Yeah.
 Those
 are
 all
 great
 things.
 Those


are
 all
 worthy
 pursuits.


I
 think
 when
 you
 look
 back
 on
 your
 life,


whatever
 stage
 of
 your
 life
 you're
 in,


most
 people


will
 recall
 a
 moment
 where
 they
 felt


loved
 or
 where
 they
 felt
 tremendous
 love


as
 the
 highest
 points
 of
 their
 life.


I
 I
 think
 even
 celebrity
 and
 I
 represent


a
 lot
 of
 celebrities
 and
 now
 like
 you


I've
 had
 a
 little
 taste
 of
 it.


That's
 really
 just
 the
 praise
 of


strangers.
 It's
 like
 the
 love
 of


strangers,
 which
 is
 lovely.
 It's
 lovely.


It's
 like
 neutrieet.
 It's
 sweet.
 It's


not
 sugar,
 but
 it's
 sweet.
 Like,
 feels


good
 to
 have
 strangers
 adore
 you.
 It's


lovely,
 you
 know?
 But
 is
 it
 the
 same
 as


having
 someone
 who
 genuinely
 knows
 you


and
 has
 a
 history
 of
 with
 you
 and
 really


loves
 you?
 Like
 I
 think
 all
 of
 us
 know


if
 we're
 honest
 that
 when
 we
 look
 back


on
 our
 life
 at
 the
 moments
 where
 we
 felt


the
 most
 glad
 that
 we're
 here,
 it
 was


usually


something
 that
 we
 felt
 that
 made
 us
 feel


loved
 or
 that
 we
 got
 to
 feel
 loved


towards
 someone
 else
 or
 or
 ideally
 a


combination
 of
 the
 two.
 So
 I
 think


romantic
 love
 is
 a
 great
 opportunity
 and


you
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 someone
 who's


religious
 and
 therefore
 believes
 that


marriage
 is
 a
 sacrament
 that
 you're


called
 to
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 creating


children.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 be
 someone


who
 believes
 that
 you
 know
 marriage
 is


good
 for
 society
 and
 therefore
 that's


why
 we
 have
 to
 do
 it
 is
 if
 you
 love


America
 or
 you
 love
 the
 UK
 you
 have
 to


do
 this
 for
 the
 country.
 It
 really
 can


just
 be
 to
 look
 inside
 your
 own


experience
 as
 a
 human
 being
 and
 look


inside
 your
 own
 feelings
 and
 say,
 "Okay,


when
 have
 I
 felt
 truly
 loved?
 When
 have


I
 felt
 love?
 And
 were
 those
 the
 highest


moments
 in
 my
 life?
 Were
 those
 the
 best


moments
 in
 my
 life?"
 A
 lot
 of
 those


other
 things
 that
 you
 just
 described


like
 holiday,
 it's
 usually
 not
 by


yourself.
 It's
 usually
 with
 other


people.
 It's
 usually
 with
 someone.
 Even


if
 it's
 transient
 love,
 it's
 some
 kind


of
 connection
 to
 another
 person.
 So
 the


the
 bigger
 question
 is
 is
 is
 the
 unique


form
 of
 love
 that
 that
 comes
 with
 a
 pair


bond,
 right?
 I
 you
 find
 one
 person
 and


you
 make
 that
 person
 your
 person.
 Like


is
 that
 the
 permutation
 that
 works
 for


you?
 And
 I
 think
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 try
 at
 that
 and
 fail.
 The


majority
 of
 people
 try
 at
 that
 and
 fail.


Is
 the
 solution
 to
 that
 to
 give
 up
 on


it?
 I
 don't
 think
 so.
 I
 think
 the


solution
 to
 it
 is
 to
 figure
 out
 when
 it


works
 because
 when
 it
 works,
 it
 it's
 so


good,
 right?
 Talk
 to
 anybody
 who's


really
 had
 a
 great
 successful
 long-term


relationship.
 Again,
 even
 if
 it


eventually
 ends,
 even
 if
 you
 know,


happily
 ever
 after
 means
 happily
 ever


after
 separately.
 If
 you
 had
 10,
 20


years
 of
 your
 life
 where
 you
 felt
 deep,


wonderful
 intimate
 connection
 with


another
 person
 and
 great
 sexual


satisfaction
 and
 all
 kinds
 of
 other


things
 like
 you
 know
 at
 best
 right
 like


you're
 you're
 getting
 married
 okay
 and


if
 you
 have
 a
 monogous
 marriage
 I
 would


like
 to
 think
 that


you
 will
 sleep
 with
 as
 many
 women
 as
 you


want
 to
 which
 will
 be
 one


and
 she
 will
 sleep
 with
 as
 many
 men
 as


she
 wants
 to,
 which
 will
 be
 one.
 Cuz


when
 I'm
 full,


I'm
 not
 hungry.
 I
 don't
 need
 more
 to


eat.
 Like
 when
 I'm
 satisfied,
 I
 don't


need
 more.
 Like
 if
 if
 the
 goal
 of
 a


monogous
 marriage,
 if
 the
 goal
 of
 a


traditional
 marriage
 is
 that
 we're
 going


to
 say
 to
 each
 other,
 "Hey,
 you
 and
 I,


we're
 going
 to
 share
 space.
 We're
 going


to
 share
 a
 journey
 together.
 We're
 going


to
 play
 a
 very
 important
 role
 in
 each


other's
 lives.
 We're
 going
 to
 add
 to


that.
 there's
 this
 romantic
 and
 sexual


component
 which
 makes
 it
 something
 other


than
 a
 friendship
 and
 most
 marriages


you're
 saying
 we're
 going
 to
 only
 share


that
 aspect
 of
 self
 with
 each
 other.


Okay.
 So
 if
 that's
 what
 you
 want
 and


what
 comes
 from
 that
 is
 you
 know


something
 you
 want
 to
 feel
 and
 that
 is
 I


want
 to
 feel
 deeply
 connected.
 I
 want
 to


feel
 a
 connection
 that
 gets
 deeper
 and


deeper.
 I
 want
 to
 feel
 safe
 in
 this


relationship.
 Emotionally,
 physically,
 I


want
 to
 feel
 safe
 in
 it.
 Like,
 I
 just


think
 that
 there's
 tremendous
 value
 in


saying
 that
 out
 loud
 to
 each
 other
 from


the
 beginning
 and
 saying
 to
 each
 other,


what
 can
 we
 do
 to
 to
 if
 we
 both
 have


decided
 this
 is
 something
 we're
 going
 to


do,
 we
 don't
 have
 to
 do
 it,
 but
 we're


going
 to
 do
 it.
 How
 can
 we
 keep
 this


thing
 lovely
 and
 connected?
 And
 I
 I


think
 the
 answer
 really
 is
 not
 that


complicated.


>> Do
 you
 think
 prenups
 help
 marriages


last?


>> Yes.


>> You're
 saying
 that
 as
 a
 divorce
 lawyer


who
 gets
 paid
 to
 write
 them?


>> No.
 Because
 it's
 the
 least
 profitable


thing
 we
 do.


>> Oh,
 okay.


>> Yeah.
 Prenups
 are
 so
 easy.
 Like
 they're,


you
 know,
 they're
 really
 like
 to
 the


point
 now
 where
 they're
 essentially


automated.
 Like
 I
 see
 a
 future
 where
 AI


is
 just
 going
 to
 do
 them.
 Like
 it's


really
 not
 that
 tricky.


>> Do
 you
 think
 I
 should
 get
 a
 prenup?


>> Yes,
 of
 course.


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 I
 should
 get a
 prenup?


>> You
 have
 a
 prenup?
 It'll
 either
 be


written
 by
 the
 state
 legislature
 or


it'll
 be
 written
 by
 you
 and
 she.
 Who
 do


you
 trust
 more?
 You've
 been
 to
 the
 DMV.


Have
 you
 walked
 into
 the
 DMV
 and
 went,


"Oh,
 these
 people
 are
 great.
 They
 should


be
 in
 charge
 of
 everything."
 I
 mean,
 you


know what?
 They
 should
 make
 the
 rules


for
 our
 marriage.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 even


though
 this
 legislature
 changes


constantly,
 like
 whoever
 you
 are,


whatever
 your
 political
 views
 are,
 in


the
 last
 20
 years,
 at
 some
 point
 you've


gone,
 I
 cannot
 believe
 who's
 in
 charge


here.
 I
 cannot
 believe
 who's
 in
 charge


of
 the
 government.
 Whatever
 side
 of
 the


aisle
 you're
 on.
 So
 what
 you're
 saying


cuz
 your
 marriage
 has
 a
 prenup.
 You
 get


married,
 you've
 got
 a
 prenup.
 You're


saying
 I
 trust
 the
 legislature
 of
 the


state
 in
 which
 we
 will
 be
 residing
 in


the
 future
 in
 the
 event
 we
 break
 up
 more


than
 I
 trust
 my
 partner
 who
 I've
 chosen


out
 of
 8
 billion
 options.


>> I
 imagine
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 listening


would


be
 scared
 to
 mention
 a
 prenup
 to
 their


partner.


>> And
 those
 people
 in
 particular,
 by
 the


way,
 it's
 just
 like
 I
 said
 about,
 you


know,
 I
 don't
 have
 15
 minutes
 a
 day
 to


meditate.
 Great.
 that
 you
 need
 an
 hour.


If
 you'd
 be
 scared
 to
 mention
 a
 prenup


to
 your
 partner,
 then
 then
 you
 should


definitely
 mention
 a
 prenup
 to
 your


partner
 because
 what
 that
 means
 is
 I'm


afraid
 to
 have
 a
 hard
 conversation
 with


my
 partner.
 And
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 get


married,
 you
 should
 get
 accustomed
 to


having
 hard
 conversations.
 Life
 is
 going


to
 come
 at
 you
 very
 fast.
 And
 there's


going
 to
 be
 lots
 of
 things
 that
 happen


that
 require
 hard
 conversations.


>> What
 if
 my
 partner
 says
 no?


>> Says
 no
 to
 the
 prenup.


>> Yeah.


have
 a
 conversation
 about
 why


>> and
 they
 say
 you
 don't
 trust
 me
 like
 you


think
 I'm
 going
 to
 take
 your
 stuff.
 This


is
 not
 very
 sexy.
 This
 is


>> well
 arguably
 you
 don't
 trust
 me


equally,
 right?
 Because
 that
 trust
 works


both
 ways.
 So
 what
 what
 what
 you're


saying
 when
 you
 say
 you
 don't
 trust
 me


is
 you're
 saying
 that
 you
 don't
 trust


that
 this
 marriage
 is
 going
 to
 last
 or


you
 don't
 trust
 you're
 saying
 you
 don't


trust
 that
 in
 the
 event
 this
 marriage


ends
 we
 won't
 be
 fair
 to
 each
 other.


Right?
 So,
 why
 would
 you
 marry
 someone


who
 you
 don't
 believe
 that
 they're
 going


to
 be
 fair
 to
 you?
 What
 you're
 you're


not
 protecting
 yourselves
 against
 each


other.
 You're
 protecting
 yourselves


against
 the
 government
 making
 the
 rule


set
 in
 the
 event
 that
 that
 your
 marriage


ends
 in
 something
 other
 than
 death.


>> You
 know,
 I've
 got
 a
 friend
 um
 there's


two
 people
 that
 convinced
 me
 that
 I


should
 get
 a
 prenup.


>> One
 of
 them
 was
 you.


>> Thanks.
 Um,
 and
 then
 the
 other
 was


watching
 a
 friend
 go
 through
 divorce
 and


he
 said
 to
 me
 actually
 when
 we
 we
 went


for
 dinner
 one
 time
 that
 it
 was
 it
 was


it
 was
 looking
 at
 his
 face
 and
 seeing


the
 like
 depression
 in
 his
 face
 from
 the


process
 because
 not
 only
 had
 it
 ruined


his
 relationship
 with
 his
 ex-wife


because
 they've
 gone
 through
 this


onslaught
 for
 seven
 years
 where
 two
 sets


of
 lawyers
 were
 fighting
 either
 side.
 He


said
 that
 he
 had
 paid
 for
 the
 lawyer
 her


lawyers


>> which
 he
 has
 to
 do
 which
 I
 I
 wasn't


>> Yeah.
 There's
 a
 presumption
 that
 the


higher
 earning
 individual
 should
 be


responsible
 for
 the
 legal
 reasonable


legal
 fees
 of
 the
 the
 less
 uh
 earning


spouse.


>> He
 said
 her
 lawyer
 has
 now
 got
 like
 a


skyscraper
 whereas
 when
 this
 divorce


started
 he
 was
 in
 a
 small
 little
 office.


Now
 he's
 got
 like
 some
 massive
 building


because
 he's
 had
 to
 spend
 tens
 of


millions
 on
 her
 lawyers.


>> And


>> yeah,
 I've
 had
 clients
 who
 paid


millions.
 The
 other
 thing
 he
 said
 was


that
 he
 has


her
 lawyer
 is
 trying
 to
 inflate
 his


assets


>> to
 tell
 the
 judge
 that
 his
 business
 is


worth


>> billions
 of
 dollars
 when
 now
 I
 know
 why


this
 divorce
 is
 taking
 so
 long.
 They


have
 dueling
 experts.
 So
 instead
 of
 of


the
 two
 lawyers
 hiring
 neutral
 a
 neutral


expert
 to
 value
 his
 business
 interests,


what
 they've
 elected
 to
 do
 instead
 is
 to


hire
 individual
 partisan
 experts.
 And


that
 happens
 sometimes.
 And
 when
 you


hire
 an
 individual
 partisan
 expert,
 of


course
 you're
 going
 to,
 you
 know,
 if
 you


represent
 the
 party
 who
 wants
 half
 of


this
 thing,
 you're
 going
 to
 find


someone.
 You
 can,
 the
 cigarette


companies
 had
 doctors
 who
 were
 willing


to
 testify
 that
 cigarettes
 are
 good
 for


you.
 Like
 you
 can
 find
 an
 expert
 to
 say


almost
 anything
 if
 you
 pay
 them
 enough.


So
 you
 find
 credible
 experts
 that
 will


overly
 value
 the
 business
 and
 then


because
 value
 is
 speculative
 and
 then


the
 other
 side
 has
 an
 incentive
 to
 hire


experts
 who
 will
 deliberately
 diminish


the
 value
 of
 the
 business
 and
 then
 you


have
 two
 opportunities.
 One
 is
 you
 can


play
 with
 the
 data
 set
 and
 you
 can


impeach
 the
 data
 set
 and
 then
 the
 other


is
 you
 can
 impeach
 the
 conclusion
 that


came
 from
 the
 data
 set.
 So
 you
 can
 say


you
 used
 the
 wrong
 data
 and
 that's
 how


you
 got
 to
 the
 wrong
 conclusion.
 Or
 you


can
 say
 you
 use
 the
 right
 data
 but
 you


came
 to
 the
 wrong
 conclusion
 or
 some


combination
 of
 both.
 Like
 this
 is
 the


[ __ ]
 I
 get
 to
 do
 all
 day
 in
 a
 courtroom


is
 to
 like
 try
 to
 engineer
 those
 optics


or
 prevent
 those
 optics
 from
 being


engineered
 in
 that
 direction.


>> And
 say
 that
 I
 was
 going
 through
 a


divorce
 now
 with
 my
 partner.
 Mhm.


>> My
 wife
 would
 well
 her
 lawyer
 would


theoretically
 be
 trying
 to
 say
 that
 this


podcast
 is
 worth
 a
 billion
 dollars


because
 then
 theoretically


>> she's
 entitled
 to
 a
 larger
 percentage.


Yeah.


>> She
 might
 be
 entitled
 to
 500
 million.


And
 if
 the
 judge
 believes
 that
 this


podcast
 is
 worth
 a
 billion,
 I
 need
 to


find
 a
 way
 to
 pay
 her
 500
 million.


>> Yeah.


>> Even
 if
 I
 don't
 have
 it,


>> it
 can
 be
 paid
 over
 time.
 It's
 what's


called
 a
 distributive
 award.
 It
 can
 be


paid
 over
 an
 extended
 period
 of
 time.


That's


>> and
 my
 lawyer
 is
 going
 to
 be
 trying
 to


argue
 that
 this
 is
 worth
 nothing.


>> Nothing.
 It's
 absolutely
 effortless.


It's
 worth
 nothing.
 You
 should
 have


negative
 contingency
 discounts,
 a
 key


man
 discount.
 It's
 a
 lack
 of
 discount


for
 marketability.
 There's
 Yeah,
 this
 is


all
 I
 do
 all
 day.
 This
 is
 the
 gig.
 And


and
 see,
 you
 know
 why
 you
 want
 a
 prenup


is
 cuz
 God
 forbid
 for
 both
 of
 you
 that


that
 happens.
 Like
 you're
 you're
 going


to
 pay
 me.
 I
 get
 a
 thousand
 dollars
 an


hour
 to
 help
 people
 navigate
 that
 kind


of
 chaos
 or
 to
 create
 that
 kind
 of
 chaos


as
 a
 weapon
 against
 a
 person
 or
 to
 just


threaten
 that
 kind
 of
 chaos.


>> Doesn't
 that
 mean
 it's
 your
 in
 your


interest
 to
 stretch
 to
 amplify
 conflict


and
 stretch
 it
 out
 and
 protract
 it?
 And


by
 the
 way,
 I
 manipulate
 people's


emotional
 state
 for
 a
 living.
 I
 said


that
 earlier.
 You
 don't
 think
 I
 could


use
 my
 powers
 for
 evil
 to
 get
 my
 client


terrified
 and
 worried
 that
 forces
 are


aligning
 against
 him?
 By
 the
 way,
 that's


how
 good
 lawyers
 get
 their
 reputation
 as


being
 good
 lawyers
 because
 sometimes
 we


have
 a
 client
 where
 we
 could
 potentially


make
 millions
 of
 dollars
 and
 we
 settle


the
 case
 within
 like
 $10,000
 worth
 of


fee.
 Like
 I
 have
 a
 case
 right
 now
 where


my
 opposing
 council
 is
 I
 I
 would


consider
 the
 only
 lawyer
 in
 New
 York


City
 better
 than
 me.
 like
 he's
 sort
 of


like
 an
 idol
 to
 me
 in
 the
 sense
 that


he's
 such
 a
 good
 trial
 lawyer
 and
 he's


my
 adversary
 on
 this
 case
 and
 it's
 not


the
 first
 case
 we've
 had
 against
 each


other
 and
 we
 are
 like
 when
 the
 two
 of
 us


go
 in
 a
 courtroom
 it's
 like
 T-Rexes


fighting


we're
 going
 to
 settle
 this
 case
 in
 like


two
 phone
 calls
 because
 we
 both
 are
 just


not
 the
 kind
 of
 people
 that
 are
 going
 to


unnecessarily
 amplify
 conflict.
 We
 we
 we


have
 our
 reputation
 because
 we
 don't
 do


that.
 Like
 the
 best
 of
 us,
 that's
 how


you
 earn
 the
 reputation.
 The
 people
 that


do
 that
 amplifying
 of
 conflict,
 word


gets
 out.
 Word
 gets
 out
 and
 that's
 this


is
 a
 business
 where
 you
 live
 and
 die
 by


your
 reputation.

 Make

 to


yourself.
 I'm
 inviting
 10,000
 of
 you
 to


come
 even
 deeper
 into
 the
 diary
 of
 a


CEO.
 Welcome
 to
 my
 inner
 circle.
 This
 is


a
 brand
 new
 private
 community
 that
 I'm


launching
 to
 the
 world.
 We
 have
 so
 many


incredible
 things
 that
 happen
 that
 you


are
 never
 shown.
 We
 have
 the
 briefs
 that


are
 on
 my
 iPad
 when
 I'm
 recording
 the


conversation.
 We
 have
 clips
 we've
 never


released.
 We
 have
 behindthe-scenes


conversations
 with
 the
 guest
 and
 also


the
 episodes
 that
 we've
 never
 ever


released.
 And
 so
 much
 more.
 In
 the


circle,
 you'll
 have
 direct
 access
 to
 me.


You
 can
 tell
 us
 what
 you
 want
 this
 show


to
 be,
 who
 you
 want
 us
 to
 interview,
 and


the
 types
 of
 conversations
 you
 would


love
 us
 to
 have.
 But
 remember,
 for
 now,


we're
 only
 inviting
 the
 first
 10,000


people
 that
 join
 before
 it
 closes.
 So,


if
 you
 want
 to
 join
 our
 private
 closed


community,
 head
 to
 the
 link
 in
 the


description
 below
 or
 go
 to


daccircle.com.


I
 will
 speak
 to
 you
 there.


>> So,
 I
 have


some
 M&M's
 here
 or
 something.


>> You
 love
 M&M's.
 Um,
 explain
 to
 me.


>> So,
 this
 is
 actually
 a
 great


illustration
 of
 what
 a
 prenup
 should
 be.


Okay.
 All
 a
 prenup
 is,
 a
 prenup
 is
 not
 a


referendum
 on
 the
 likelihood
 of
 us


breaking
 up.
 A
 prenup
 is
 not
 a


commentary
 on
 how
 much
 we
 trust
 each


other.
 A
 prenup
 is
 not
 um,
 you
 know,
 an


opportunity
 to
 screw
 the
 person
 you're


about
 to
 join
 lives
 with.
 Okay?
 A
 prenup


is
 a
 rule
 set.
 It's
 creating
 tranches.


Okay?
 So,
 you
 have
 some
 things.
 She
 has


some
 things.
 Right
 now,
 you
 don't
 owe


her
 anything.
 She
 doesn't
 owe
 you


anything.
 Yours
 is
 yours.
 Hers
 is
 hers.


You're
 in
 the
 title
 system.


>> Can
 we
 talk
 about
 if
 we're
 just
 dating?


>> So,
 if
 we're
 dating,
 I
 heard
 that


there's
 some
 laws
 where
 if
 you
 date


someone
 long
 enough,
 eventually
 they
 can


basically
 argue
 that
 they
 own
 your


stuff.


>> Yeah.
 So
 that's
 called
 what
 used
 to
 be


called
 common
 law
 marriage
 or
 it
 makes


you
 responsible
 for
 what
 we
 used
 to
 call


palimony
 which
 is
 like
 alimony
 for
 a


friend
 palimony.
 Okay.
 Um
 most


jurisdictions
 no
 longer
 honor
 that.
 It


doesn't
 exist.
 It
 was
 largely
 a
 function


of
 the
 absence
 of
 marriage
 equality.
 So


once
 marriage
 equality
 occurred,
 once


gay
 and
 lesbian
 individuals
 could
 marry,


the
 court
 system
 essentially
 started


saying
 there's
 no
 such
 thing
 as
 a
 quasi


marital
 relationship
 anymore.
 If
 you
 are


married,
 you're
 married.
 If
 you're
 not,


you're
 not.
 So,
 if
 you
 decide
 to
 live


together
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 marriage,


then
 you
 can't
 have
 a
 quasi
 marital


relationship
 anymore.
 Now
 that
 marriage


equality
 is
 the
 law
 of
 the
 land
 and


everyone
 who
 wants
 to
 get
 married
 is


allowed
 to
 get
 married.
 You
 can't
 say,


"Well,
 we
 were
 kind
 of
 like
 married,
 but


we
 weren't
 married."
 Like,
 you're
 either


married
 or
 you're
 not
 married.
 Those
 are


the
 two
 tranches.
 So,
 that
 situation,


you're
 in
 the
 title
 system.
 Yours
 is


yours,
 hers
 is
 hers.
 There
 is
 no
 wei


except
 for
 the
 voluntary
 wei.


>> Okay.
 So
 now
 using
 coming
 back
 to
 this


example
 of
 these
 M&Ms
 and
 prenups.


>> So
 here's
 what
 marriage
 is
 simply
 put.


There's
 you,
 there's
 me,
 this
 is
 we.


This
 is
 the
 bucket
 of
 we.
 Okay?
 When
 we


get
 married,
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 you.


I
 didn't
 put
 it
 all.
 See
 how
 I
 didn't


put
 it
 all?
 Okay,
 I'm
 keeping
 this


separate.
 That's
 called
 separate


property.
 Okay,
 in
 California,
 this
 is


called
 community
 property.
 This
 is


anything
 I
 acquire
 during
 the
 marriage.


Okay,
 this
 is
 separate
 property.
 If
 I


keep
 it
 separate,
 it
 stays
 separate.


Okay,
 it
 stays
 separate.
 Keep
 that


thought.
 This
 is
 her.
 Okay.


So,
 she's
 put
 some
 of
 hers
 in
 there,


too.
 May
 not
 be
 exactly
 the
 same,
 but


it's
 pretty
 close
 to
 it.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


we
 just
 got
 married.
 It's
 pretty
 obvious


to
 see
 which
 one's
 which,
 right?
 Okay.


So,
 so
 this
 is
 any
 marriage
 really,
 with


or
 without
 a
 prenup.
 Okay?
 This
 is
 what


marriage
 looks
 like.
 There's
 you
 and


there's
 me
 and
 there's
 we.
 We're


combining.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 this
 isn't


just
 for
 assets
 and
 liabilities.
 This
 is


like
 the
 nature
 of
 our
 stuff,
 our


furniture,
 the
 things
 we
 bring
 to
 the


relationship.
 You
 could
 even
 argue
 it's


like
 what
 we
 watch
 on
 TV,
 right?
 It's


you,
 me,
 we,
 and
 we
 combine
 the
 two.


Okay.
 Now,
 you
 and
 I
 both
 know
 this
 is


actually
 what
 it
 starts
 to
 look
 like.
 It


never
 stays
 just
 neat,
 does
 it?
 It


always
 starts
 to
 get
 kind
 of
 mixed
 up


together.
 In
 the
 law,
 we
 call
 that


co-mingling.
 Okay.
 Now,
 here's
 what's


interesting
 with
 a
 prenup.
 This
 stays


this
 simple
 because
 anything
 you
 put
 in


this
 bucket
 is
 marital.


>> And
 that
 could
 be
 stuff
 I
 bought
 for
 the


house.
 It
 could
 be
 a
 joint
 bank
 account.


It


>> could
 be
 anything.


>> Okay?
 All
 we're
 doing
 when
 we
 have
 a


prenup
 is
 yours,
 mine,
 ours,
 and
 we're


defining
 that.
 So
 maybe
 I
 want
 you
 to


feel
 I'm
 very
 invested
 in
 this


relationship.
 So
 I
 throw
 some
 more
 in.


Hey
 babe,
 I
 just
 got
 a
 bonus
 at
 work.


I'm
 throwing
 it
 into
 the
 wei.
 I'm


keeping
 a
 little
 over
 here.
 I'm
 keeping


a
 little
 over
 here.


>> Wait,
 can
 you
 do
 that
 after
 the


marriage?


>> With
 a
 prenup?


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 you
 can
 add
 to
 a
 prenup.


>> With
 a
 prenup,
 what
 you're
 saying
 is
 if


it's
 in
 my
 name,
 it's
 mine.
 Asset
 or


liability.
 If
 it's
 in
 your
 name,
 it's


yours.
 Asset
 or
 liability.
 If
 it's
 in


our
 joint
 names,
 we
 divide
 it
 50/50
 or


how
 we
 agree
 in
 writing.
 But
 we
 create


three
 separate
 buckets.
 Yours,
 mine,
 and


ours.
 Okay?
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 happens
 in


the
 state
 of
 California
 after
 seven


years
 or
 in
 the
 state
 of
 New
 York
 if
 you


co-mingle
 assets
 in
 any
 way?


This
 is
 solely
 things
 in
 your
 name.
 This


is
 solely
 things
 in
 her
 name.
 Things
 you


owned
 before
 marriage.
 This
 is
 the
 you


and
 the
 me
 before
 you
 got
 married.


It's
 community
 property
 now.
 All
 of
 it.


>> Everything.


>> All
 of
 it.
 Every
 bit
 of
 it.
 You
 didn't


have
 a
 prenup.
 Everything
 that's
 in
 it,


everything
 in
 here
 is
 is
 subject
 to


division.
 Everything
 that's
 in
 here
 is


subject
 to
 identification,
 valuation,


and
 division.
 And
 think
 about
 think


about


sorting
 that
 out.


>> And
 also
 going
 back
 to
 my
 friend,
 some


of
 the
 value
 of
 these
 assets
 is
 up
 for


debate.


>> Sure.
 Sure.
 Not
 only
 is
 the
 value


because
 look,
 some
 of
 these
 are
 cracked


and
 some
 of
 them
 aren't.
 And
 did
 they


crack
 in
 this
 process
 or
 were
 they


cracked
 before?
 Did
 she
 crack
 them
 or


did
 you
 crack
 them?
 And
 which
 ones
 are


worth
 more
 than
 the
 others?
 And
 were


these
 the
 same
 at
 the
 be?
 It
 doesn't


matter.
 It's
 all
 in.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


take
 take
 out
 the
 marital
 take
 out
 your


property.
 Now,
 how
 long
 is
 that
 going
 to


take
 you?
 It's
 impossible
 to
 do
 that.


Once
 you're
 in
 the
 community
 property


system,
 once
 you've
 put
 something
 into


the
 Wii
 category,
 if
 you
 get
 married


without
 a
 prenup,
 you
 can


unintentionally


buy
 into
 this
 into
 this
 system,
 which
 by


the
 way,
 I
 make
 a
 very
 comfortable


living
 helping
 people
 sort
 this
 out.


Whereas


whereas


all
 you
 had
 to
 do
 was
 agree
 on
 the
 rule


set
 of
 yours,
 mine,
 ours,
 and
 then
 this


is
 intentional.
 Now,
 I
 understand
 why


that's
 scary
 for
 some
 people
 because
 you


have
 to
 have
 a
 conversation
 about,
 well,


are
 we
 putting
 that
 in
 joint
 names?
 Or,


well,
 you
 got
 that
 bonus.
 Are
 you


putting
 it
 in
 my
 account
 or
 your
 account


or
 some
 in
 your
 account
 and
 some
 in
 my


account
 or
 some
 in
 this?
 But
 isn't
 it


better
 to
 keep
 some
 level
 of
 control


over
 this?


>> If
 I
 was
 a
 financially
 motivated


individual
 and
 I
 was
 marrying
 say
 you


and
 you
 were
 a
 billionaire,


>> I
 mean
 it's
 very
 much
 in
 my
 interest
 to


avoid
 this
 prenup.


>> Maybe.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 then,
 you
 know,
 it's
 all
 going


to
 become
 we
 in
 seven
 years
 time.
 So


I've
 just
 got
 to
 be
 with
 you
 for
 seven


years
 and
 then
 I
 can
 bounce
 out
 of
 this


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 make
 half
 half
 a


billion
 dollars.
 Have
 you
 ever
 seen


that?


>> Of
 course.
 Have
 you
 ever
 seen
 but
 here's


also
 what
 I
 will
 say
 to
 you.
 Flip
 that


story
 for
 a
 second.


So
 we're
 married
 for
 6
 and
 1/2
 years.


It's
 going
 pretty
 well.


We're
 at
 the
 6
 and
 1/2
 year
 mark.


You're
 you're
 a
 billionaire.
 You're


probably
 not
 stupid,
 right?
 Are
 you


going
 to
 take
 that
 bet?


>> Is
 it
 seven
 years
 is
 the
 moment


>> 7
 years
 is
 the
 moment


>> when
 it
 all
 becomes


>> community
 property.
 Yeah.
 So
 do
 you
 find


some
 very
 successful
 people


>> they
 spike
 the
 divorce
 rate
 at
 six
 years


six
 and
 a
 half
 years
 because
 why?
 It's


the
 same
 reason
 why
 I
 tell
 people
 don't


put
 don't
 put
 what
 we
 call
 you
 know


sunset
 clauses
 in
 a
 prenup
 because


people
 people
 all
 have
 the
 bright
 idea


that
 they're
 going
 to
 oh
 well
 we'll
 do
 a


prenup
 but
 after
 10
 years
 it'll
 go
 away


after
 10
 years
 you
 know
 it'll


self-destruct
 like
 in
 Mission


Impossible.
 And
 all
 that
 does
 is
 makes


people
 ask
 really
 icky
 questions
 at
 the


nine
 and
 a
 half
 year
 mark
 where
 they


have
 to
 start
 going
 because
 seven
 years


seven
 years
 it's
 like
 the
 honeymoon's


over.
 Maybe
 you
 got
 a
 kid
 or
 two
 and
 all


of a
 sudden
 you
 go,
 "Okay,
 do
 I
 want


fully
 one
 half
 of
 everything
 I
 owned


prior
 to
 the
 marriage
 to
 now
 be
 subject


to
 division?
 Is
 it
 going
 that
 good?
 Do
 I


want
 to
 take
 this
 bet?"
 Like
 look,
 we


live
 in
 reality.


What
 you're
 doing
 when
 you
 marry
 someone


is
 you're
 marrying
 your
 destiny
 to
 them


and
 you're
 making
 decisions
 about
 a


future
 that
 you
 can't
 see.
 It
 hasn't


happened
 yet.
 If
 seven
 years
 is
 the


moment
 when
 our
 assets
 become
 co-mingled


to
 the
 point
 that
 community
 property


where
 we
 have
 to
 kind
 of
 split
 our


assets
 in
 a
 relationship,
 have
 you
 ever


seen
 someone
 get
 to
 like
 seven
 years
 in


one
 day
 and
 then
 file
 for
 divorce


because
 they're
 going to
 get


>> Yeah,
 I've
 had
 people
 who
 wait
 until
 the


exact
 moment.
 Like
 there's
 other
 there's


other
 formulas
 that
 are
 applicable.
 Like


I
 I
 have
 plenty
 of
 people
 right
 now
 that


have
 come
 to
 me
 for
 a
 consultation
 and


they're
 like,
 "Yeah,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


file
 for
 another
 6
 months
 because
 we'll


hit
 20
 years
 in
 6
 months."
 And
 when
 we


hit
 that,
 it
 kicks
 up
 to
 another
 level


of
 alimony
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 formulas.


Like
 here's
 the
 thing.
 When
 the


government
 makes
 decisions
 for
 you,
 they


set
 numbers.
 Like
 there's
 a
 highway
 near


where
 we
 are
 right
 now.
 It's
 55
 miles
 an


hour
 is
 an
 acceptable
 legal
 speed
 to


drive
 on
 that.
 56
 and
 you're
 committing


a
 crime.
 76
 and
 you're
 committing
 a


different
 level
 of
 crime.
 106
 and
 you're


committing
 a
 higher
 level
 felony
 crime.


Right?
 Is
 56
 and
 55
 that
 much
 different?


No.
 We
 had
 to
 pick
 a
 number.
 So,
 we


picked
 that
 number.
 So,
 do
 you
 trust
 the


government
 to
 pick
 the
 number?
 That's


the
 only
 question
 to
 ask
 when
 you're


thinking
 about
 a
 prenup
 is,
 do
 I
 trust


the
 government
 so
 much
 that
 I'm
 going
 to


let
 them
 pick
 the
 number?
 Personally,
 I


don't.
 Personally,
 if
 I
 like
 someone
 so


much
 that
 I've
 decided
 I'm
 going
 to


choose
 them
 out
 of
 8
 billion
 other


options,
 I
 would
 think
 I
 have
 enough


faith
 in
 that
 person
 to
 come
 up
 with
 a


rule
 set
 between
 us
 that
 we
 and
 BY
 THE


WAY,
 NOT
 A
 COMPLICATED
 rule
 set.
 If
 it's


in
 my
 name,
 it's
 mine.
 If
 it's
 in
 your


name,
 it's
 yours.
 If
 it's
 in
 our
 name,


it's
 ours.
 Then
 you
 can
 have
 all
 the


conversations
 you
 want
 about
 why
 aren't


you
 putting
 things
 in
 joint
 names
 or
 why


are
 you
 putting
 things
 in
 joint
 names


and
 here's
 what
 I
 need
 to
 feel
 safe


because
 here's
 the
 thing.
 If
 you're
 the


billionaire
 or
 you're
 the
 person


marrying
 the
 billionaire
 you
 both
 want


to
 feel
 remember
 we're
 going
 back
 to


what
 is
 it
 you
 want
 to
 feel?
 What
 is
 it


you
 want
 to
 feel?
 That's
 the
 key


question.
 You
 what
 do
 you
 want
 to
 feel?


You
 both
 want
 to
 feel
 safe.
 Isn't
 that


fair?
 I've
 represented
 a
 lot
 of
 victims


of
 intimate
 partner
 abuse
 and
 domestic


violence
 and
 course
 of
 control
 and
 I
 can


tell
 you
 you
 can't
 feel
 loved
 if
 you


don't
 feel
 safe.
 And
 there's
 lots
 of


ways
 for
 a
 person
 to
 feel
 unsafe


physically,
 emotionally,
 financially.


There's
 lots
 of
 ways
 to
 make
 someone
 I


hope
 you
 want
 to
 make
 your
 fiance
 feel


safe.
 And
 I
 hope
 she
 wants
 to
 make
 you


feel
 safe.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 that
 you


make
 her
 feel
 safe.
 By
 the
 way,
 you


can't
 protect
 her
 from
 everything
 in
 the


world.
 You
 know
 that,
 right?
 Like


somebody
 drops
 a
 nuke,
 there's
 nothing


you're
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 to
 help


her
 with
 that.
 Okay?
 There's
 lots
 of


things
 that
 can
 happen
 that
 you
 can't


keep
 her
 safe
 from,
 but
 you're
 going
 to


do
 your
 darnest,
 and
 that's
 great.
 Okay.


And
 by
 the
 way,
 like
 she
 wants
 you
 to


feel
 safe.
 She
 wants
 you
 to
 feel
 safe


and
 not
 taken
 advantage
 of
 and
 loved
 for


who
 you
 are.
 Right?
 I
 I
 have
 every


confidence
 she
 does
 not
 love
 you
 just


for
 money.
 There's
 lots
 of
 people
 with


money
 in
 the
 world.
 So,
 she
 loves
 the


unique
 combination
 of
 things
 that
 are


you.
 One
 factor
 of
 which
 may
 be
 that


you're
 a
 very
 successful
 man


professionally.
 And
 that
 makes
 her
 feel


safe.
 And
 that
 makes
 her
 feel
 secure.


And
 it
 makes
 her
 feel
 like
 she
 can


really
 have
 a
 future
 with
 you
 that's
 a


bright
 and
 lovely
 one.
 And
 she
 can
 focus


her
 energies
 on
 things
 other
 than
 find.


That's
 great.
 This
 is
 great,
 man.
 We're


both
 happy.
 We're
 doing
 the
 thing.
 So,


what
 is
 wrong
 with
 just
 keeping
 this


conversation
 an
 ongoing
 conversation


about
 what
 is
 it
 we
 need
 to
 feel
 safe?


Cuz
 if
 you
 are
 in
 that
 dynamic
 where


she's
 gorgeous
 and
 he's
 rich,
 if
 she


says
 to
 him,
 "Hey,
 if
 we
 split
 up,
 I'm


going
 to
 like
 need
 some
 things.
 Like,
 I


I'm
 not
 really
 focusing
 on
 finances
 and


you
 have
 so
 much
 more
 than
 me.
 You're


telling
 me
 a
 guy's
 not
 going
 to
 say,


"Yeah,
 it
 makes
 sense."
 And
 by
 the
 way,


when's
 the
 time
 to
 have
 that


conversation?
 WHEN
 YOU'RE
 MADLY
 IN
 LOVE


WITH
 EACH
 other
 in
 the
 beginning
 of
 this


thing,
 when
 you're
 on
 your
 knee
 in
 front


of
 the
 restaurant,
 you
 know,
 proposing


to
 the
 person.
 You
 don't
 have
 it
 when


you're
 breaking
 up.
 That's
 the
 worst


time
 to
 have
 that
 conversation.
 Have
 it


when
 you're
 first
 having
 that
 abundance


of
 optimism
 and
 connection
 to
 each


other.
 And
 then
 and
 then,
 by
 the
 way,


what
 does
 he
 feel
 unsafe?
 He
 feels


unsafe
 that
 he's
 saying,
 "Look,
 I'm


willing
 to
 contribute
 financially
 to


this
 relationship.
 Clearly,
 I've
 proven


that.
 I
 bought
 you
 a
 Birkin
 bag.
 I


bought
 you
 a
 car.
 I
 pay
 for
 your
 bills.


I'm
 signing
 on
 to
 marry
 you
 and
 to
 give


you
 a
 wonderful,
 beautiful
 life."
 Are


you
 entitled
 to
 100%
 or
 50%
 of


everything
 I've
 ever
 owned?
 I
 have
 so


much
 more
 than
 you
 right
 now.
 Like,
 that


seems
 wildly.
 Do
 you
 Are
 you
 saying
 that


everything
 I
 earn
 from
 the
 date
 of


marriage
 on
 we
 should
 split?
 Like,


that's
 what's
 great
 about
 a
 prenup.
 You


can
 make
 whatever
 rules
 you
 want
 to
 in


that
 situation.
 So
 I
 I
 believe
 there
 is


genuine
 value
 in
 having
 honest


conversations
 about
 these
 things.
 Look,


I
 it's
 just
 M&M's.
 It's
 just
 money
 the


end
 of
 the
 day.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 this
 has


no
 more
 real
 value
 than
 the
 pieces
 of


paper
 you're
 holding
 in
 your
 pocket
 that


we've
 attributed
 value
 to.
 If
 anything,


this
 tastes
 good.
 Chew
 on
 money
 all
 you


want.
 It
 won't
 help.
 I
 did
 have
 this


conversation
 with
 my
 partner
 and
 we
 we


talked
 about
 it
 and
 she
 was
 very
 um
 she


was
 very
 supportive
 of
 a
 prenup
 because


she
 also
 wants
 one
 and
 she
 wants
 to


protect
 her
 assets
 and
 the
 business
 that


she's
 built
 and
 all
 those
 kinds
 of


things
 which
 was
 useful
 but
 also
 I


acknowledged
 you
 know
 that
 I'm
 I
 earn


more
 money
 so
 in
 the
 event
 that
 we
 have


a
 big
 family
 in
 the
 future
 we
 have
 four


five
 kids


>> you
 I
 think
 I
 need
 to
 contribute
 more
 to


make
 sure
 that
 she's
 fine
 in
 the
 event


>> I'm
 not
 of
 course
 but
 but
 see
 this
 is


the
 point
 you're
 a
 reasonable
 person
 if


your
 response
 when
 she
 said
 well
 you


know
 I
 we
 may
 want
 to
 have
 a
 family
 and


you
 know
 if
 we
 do
 like
 you
 have
 so
 much


more
 than
 me
 and
 although
 I'm
 signing


off
 to
 protect
 your
 assets
 like
 you
 know


the
 pursuits
 I
 I
 am
 really
 concentrating


my
 day
 on
 are
 not
 purely
 financial


they're
 more
 for
 the
 good
 of
 the
 world


or
 for
 the
 good
 of
 individuals
 I'm
 I'm
 a


helper
 I'm
 a
 person
 who
 wants
 to
 to
 to


to
 make
 the
 world
 a
 better
 place
 you


know
 I
 know
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 her
 that


I
 know
 that
 these
 are
 these
 are
 her


goals
 her
 goal
 is
 not
 to
 be
 I
 want
 to
 be


the
 CEO
 of
 everything
 her
 goal
 goals
 is


to
 help
 the
 world
 and
 to
 help
 people.


That's
 beautiful.
 That's
 probably
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 why
 you
 love
 her
 so
 much.


And
 so,
 isn't
 that
 a
 conversation
 the


two
 of
 you
 should
 have
 now
 and
 say,


"Well,
 of
 course."
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 if
 we


have
 kids,
 I'm
 going
 to
 need
 different


things.
 What's
 great
 about
 a
 prenup
 is


you
 can
 make
 one
 that
 says,
 "If
 we
 don't


have
 kids,
 it's
 this.
 If
 we
 have
 kids,


it's
 this."
 Like,
 there's
 protections


you
 can
 put
 in
 that
 make
 sense
 to
 both


of
 you.


>> What
 about
 pets?
 I've
 heard
 about
 this


petnup.


>> Petnup?
 Yeah.


>> What's
 a
 pet
 nup?
 And
 do
 people
 actually


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Pet
 a
 PTNUP
 is
 I
 actually


created
 the
 site
 trusted
 petnup.com
 and


uh
 it's
 free.
 It's
 100%
 free.
 It's
 uh
 if


you
 it's
 a
 pay
 as
 you
 wish.
 So
 if
 you


want
 to
 to
 pay
 anything
 towards
 it,
 100%


of
 it
 goes
 to
 animal
 shelters
 basically


to
 to
 501c3
 animal
 shelters.
 But


essentially
 what
 we
 have
 found
 is


happening
 more
 in
 the
 legal
 system
 right


now
 is
 the
 equivalent
 of
 custody
 cases


but
 for
 companion
 animals.
 So
 people


have
 a
 dog,
 people
 have
 a
 cat,
 people


have
 a
 bird,
 people
 have
 any
 combination


of
 animals.
 We
 feel
 deeply
 emotionally


invested
 in
 our
 pets.
 Um
 the
 law
 for


many
 years
 looked
 at
 pets
 as
 what
 was


called
 cattle.
 Chatt
 is
 property
 and


property
 is
 essentially
 like
 if
 you


killed
 someone's
 dog,
 you
 owed
 them
 the


replacement
 value
 of
 the
 dog.


>> What
 do
 you
 tend
 to
 see
 from
 a
 legal


perspective
 here?
 Is
 it
 that
 at
 one


point
 they
 bought
 a
 pet
 together,
 they


never
 really
 clarified
 who
 owns
 the
 pet.


They
 go
 through
 a
 divorce.
 They're
 both


arguing
 over
 the
 pet.


>> That
 happened
 a
 lot.
 Yeah,
 that
 was
 the


most
 common
 permutation.
 Sometimes
 it


was
 they
 got
 a
 pet
 together
 while
 they


were
 dating
 and
 one
 of
 them
 was
 living,


you
 know,
 in
 their
 own
 apartment
 or


whatever
 and
 the
 dog
 or
 cat
 was
 living


with
 them
 and
 then
 they
 merged
 their


homes
 and
 now
 they
 both
 grow
 deeply


attached
 to
 this
 animal
 and
 you
 know


they've
 spent
 5
 years
 or
 10
 years


together
 with
 this
 animal
 and
 now
 they


both
 like
 a
 child.
 They
 both
 have
 this


like
 a
 stepchild
 is
 very
 similar
 like


it's
 not
 my
 blood
 child
 but
 it's
 you


know
 someone
 who
 I've
 spent
 a
 long
 time


with
 and
 been
 part
 of
 their
 care
 and
 I


mean
 something
 to
 them.
 What's
 the


legal?
 What's
 what what's
 the


>> Well,
 for
 many
 many
 years,
 pets
 were


considered
 chatt.
 They
 were
 considered


property.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 remember
 a


case
 in
 New
 York
 County
 where
 the


parties
 could
 not
 agree
 on
 what
 to
 do


with
 the
 dog,
 like
 who
 would
 keep
 the


dog.
 And
 the
 judge
 said,
 "Okay,
 I'm


ordering
 the
 dog
 to
 be
 sold
 and
 the


proceeds
 divided."
 And
 of
 course,
 the


people
 then
 went
 outside
 and
 figured,
 it


was
 very
 Solomonike.
 The
 people
 went


outside
 and
 figured
 out
 a
 visitation


schedule
 for
 the
 dog.
 But
 what
 we're


just
 saying
 is
 just
 like
 anything
 in
 a


prenup,
 do
 this
 in
 advance.
 Just
 do
 this


in
 advance.
 you
 have
 a
 pet,
 have
 a


petup.
 Even
 if
 you're
 not
 getting


married,
 if
 you're
 cohabitating
 or


you're
 dating
 someone,
 have
 a
 contract


that
 says,
 "We
 both
 care
 about
 this


animal.
 We've
 adopted
 this
 animal
 or
 we


purchased
 this
 animal
 or
 we
 brought
 this


animal
 into
 our
 lives.
 And
 now,
 in
 the


event
 that
 our
 relationship
 ends,
 here's


what
 the
 rules
 will
 be.
 We
 will
 jointly


make
 important
 medical
 decisions
 and
 be


guided
 by
 the
 veterinarian's,
 you
 know,


perspective.
 Um
 if
 if
 either
 of
 us
 ever


is
 going
 to
 give
 up
 the
 animal
 for


adoption,
 the
 other
 person
 will
 have
 the


automatic
 right
 to
 adopt
 the
 animal.
 If


the
 time
 eventually
 comes
 where
 there


has
 been
 a
 recommendation
 of
 euthanasia


by
 we
 will
 both
 be
 entitled
 to
 be
 there


when
 we
 say
 goodbye
 to
 that
 dog
 or
 we'll


both
 be
 entitled
 to
 jointly
 agree
 on


where
 that
 animal's
 ashes
 will
 be
 or


where
 they'll
 be
 buried
 or
 we'll
 each
 be


entitled
 to
 one
 half
 of
 the
 ashes
 or


we'll
 have
 a
 visitation
 schedule
 for
 the


dog
 in
 the
 event
 that
 we
 separate.


That's
 what
 a
 petnup
 is.
 A
 petup
 is
 a


contract
 between
 two
 people.
 Look,
 just


like
 kids,


pets
 didn't
 ask
 for
 this.
 Pets
 didn't


ask
 for
 you
 guys
 to
 break
 up.
 It's
 not


their
 fault.
 Like,
 I
 don't
 know
 anybody


that
 ever
 broke
 up
 because
 of
 the
 dog
 or


the
 cat.
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 somebody
 out


there,
 but
 that's
 not
 what
 it's
 about.


So,
 it
 is
 very,
 very
 useful
 to
 have
 in


advance
 a
 rule
 set.
 I
 like
 rules
 in


advance.
 I
 like
 to
 know
 the
 rules
 of
 the


game
 that
 we're
 playing
 because
 we
 can


adjust
 our
 behavior
 accordingly.
 Is
 um


divorce
 increasing
 statistically?


>> So
 it's
 the
 most
 recent
 statistic
 is
 the


divorce
 rate
 is
 slowly
 going
 up.
 It
 was


low.
 It
 had
 it
 had
 gone
 down.
 It
 went


down
 during
 the
 pandemic.
 Part
 of
 that


was
 a
 function
 of
 access
 to
 the
 court


system.
 When
 again
 when
 you're
 looking


at
 the
 divorce
 rate,
 the
 divorce
 rate
 is


calculated
 based
 on
 the
 filing
 of
 what's


called
 certificate
 of
 dissolution
 of


marriage,
 which
 is
 the
 final
 document


that's
 filed
 with
 the
 state
 by
 the
 court


system
 when
 a
 divorce
 has
 been


finalized.
 So
 all
 you're
 really
 seeing


there
 is
 what
 marriage
 is


catastrophically
 failed
 and
 and
 there


was
 a
 judgment
 of
 divorce
 center.
 There


are
 many
 people
 that
 just
 go
 out
 for


milk
 and
 never
 come
 back
 or
 they


physically
 separate
 and
 then
 they
 never


finalize
 the
 divorce.
 They're
 not


factored
 into
 that
 statistic.
 So,
 and


the
 people
 who
 quietly
 stay
 together


miserable
 or
 live
 in
 different
 places


and
 just
 move
 out
 and
 never
 finalize


their
 divorce.
 That
 that
 that
 statistic


doesn't
 include
 any
 of
 those
 people.


These
 are
 just
 the
 people
 that
 it


actually
 ended
 in
 divorce
 and
 that


divorce
 was
 registered
 with
 the
 state.


But
 the
 divorce
 rate
 went
 down
 and
 then


it
 the
 divorce
 filing
 rate
 spiked
 when


the
 court
 systems
 opened
 back
 up
 post


pandemic
 and
 now
 it's
 steadily
 going


back
 up
 again.
 Now
 what's
 interesting
 is


the
 marriage
 rate
 is
 going
 down
 and
 the


average
 age
 at
 which
 people
 marry
 is


going
 up.
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 the


generational
 divide
 here
 and
 it
 says


younger
 couples
 so
 millennials
 and
 Gen
 Z


divorce
 rates
 have
 plummeted.
 They
 are


marrying
 later,
 cohabiting
 first
 and


statistically
 more
 selective
 leading
 to


more
 stable
 marriages.
 However,
 there
 is


something
 called
 the
 gray
 divorce.


divorce
 rates
 for
 people
 over
 50
 um
 they


refer
 to
 as
 gray
 divorce
 has
 doubled


since
 1990
 and
 tripled
 for
 those
 over


65.


>> Yeah.
 Gray
 divorce
 is
 a
 uh
 something


that
 a
 lot
 of
 divorce
 lawyers
 are


thinking
 and
 talking
 a
 lot
 about
 right


now
 which
 is
 that
 first
 of
 all
 people


are
 living
 much
 longer.
 People
 are


living
 in
 a
 different
 way
 much
 longer


thanks
 to
 things
 like
 erectile


dysfunction
 medication.
 like
 you
 know
 an


80year-old
 having
 you
 know
 a
 active
 sex


life
 is
 not
 something
 that
 really


existed


so
 often
 prior
 to
 the
 pharmaceutical


advent
 of
 erectile
 dysfunction
 drugs


which
 really
 only
 occurred
 in
 the
 last


20
 years.
 So
 there's
 a
 big
 change
 in
 in


what
 a
 70year-old
 or
 80year-old's


quality
 of
 life
 is
 and
 what
 they
 look


like
 and
 what
 their
 health
 is
 like.
 So,


you
 know,
 with
 with
 uh
 hormone


replacement
 therapy,
 with
 you
 know,
 all


the
 different
 medications
 that
 are
 out


there,
 people
 are
 living
 more
 uh


sexually
 uh
 you
 know,
 and
 romantically


charged
 lives
 in
 their
 elder
 years
 than


they
 used
 to,
 which
 often
 leads
 people


to
 say,
 you
 know what,
 I've
 got
 10
 more


years.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 stay
 in
 this


unhappy
 relationship
 and
 I'm
 going
 to


split
 up.
 I
 actually
 don't
 think,
 by
 the


way,
 that
 those
 two
 statistics
 that
 you


just
 talked
 about
 are
 unrelated.
 I
 think


millennials
 they
 they
 haven't
 been


married
 for
 that
 long
 yet.
 Like
 the


question
 of
 catastrophic
 failure
 of
 a


marriage
 like
 I
 I've
 said
 it
 before
 that


people
 get
 divorced
 the
 same
 way
 they
 go


bankrupt
 very
 slowly
 and
 then
 all
 at


once.


>> What
 two
 of
 the
 reasons
 given
 in
 the


research
 I
 did
 as
 well
 were
 quite
 quite


unobvious
 on
 the
 surface.
 One
 of
 them
 is


that
 women
 in
 this
 generation
 boomers


and
 Gen
 Z
 are
 more
 likely
 to
 have
 their


own
 careers
 and
 retirement
 savings
 than


previous
 generations.
 Meaning
 they
 can


afford
 to
 leave
 unhappy
 marriages.
 And


when
 I've
 spoken
 with
 menopause
 experts


and
 so
 on,
 they
 they've
 told
 me
 they
 see


this
 often
 that
 in
 this
 season
 of
 life,


women
 will,
 you
 know,
 make
 a
 decision
 to


to
 leave.
 And
 the
 other
 one
 is
 the


reduced
 stigma
 about
 divorce.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 divorce
 is
 no
 longer
 seen
 as
 a
 moral


failure,
 making
 it
 socially
 easier
 to


split
 later
 in
 life.


>> I
 believe
 that
 that's
 true.
 I
 think
 that


we've
 definitely
 changed
 the
 manner
 in


which
 we
 relate
 to
 divorce.
 We
 no
 longer


consider
 it
 a
 catastrophic
 failure


socially.
 I
 think
 that
 we
 often
 see
 it


as
 the
 ending
 of
 a
 chapter
 and
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 new
 one.
 I
 don't
 think


that
 that's
 bad.
 I
 think
 dstigmatizing


divorce
 and
 seeing
 that,
 okay,
 sometimes


it
 is
 better
 for
 people
 when
 the


relationship
 is
 no
 longer
 working
 for


both
 of
 them
 and
 they've
 done
 the
 things


they've
 tried
 to
 do
 to
 make
 it
 work
 and


they've
 decided
 that
 happily
 ever
 after


means
 happily
 ever
 after
 separately.
 I


don't
 think
 that's
 necessarily
 a
 bad


thing.
 Similarly,
 you
 could
 make
 the


argument
 that
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


millennials,
 and
 again,
 only
 time
 will


tell,
 that
 millennials
 are
 better
 at
 uh


staying
 married
 is
 going
 to
 be
 that
 they


go
 into
 it
 with
 more
 realistic


expectations.
 They
 don't
 go
 into
 it
 with


the
 expectation
 that
 this
 person's
 going


to
 be
 their
 everything.
 They
 they
 look


at
 it
 and
 go,
 "Yeah,
 as
 a
 human
 being,


I'm
 marrying
 another
 human
 being.
 I


haven't
 quite
 figured
 myself
 out."


>> Which
 of
 your
 books
 was
 more
 popular?


How
 not
 to
 [ __ ]
 up
 your
 marriage,


straight
 talk
 from
 a
 divorce
 lawyer


who's
 seen
 it
 all,
 or
 how
 to
 stay
 in


love?
 So,
 How
 to
 Stay
 in
 Love
 has
 been


out
 longer.
 Yeah.
 So,
 it's
 done
 quite


well
 um
 over
 the
 period
 of
 time.
 It's
 in


its
 fourth
 printing
 right
 now.


>> And
 what
 what
 about
 this
 book
 do
 you


think
 was
 resonant?
 Is
 there
 a


particular
 idea
 that
 was
 number
 one
 in


this
 book?


>> I
 think
 a
 it
 was
 the
 first
 book
 written


by
 a
 divorce
 lawyer
 to
 headon
 take
 on


the
 topic
 of
 how
 to
 not
 get
 divorced.
 It


was
 a
 how
 not
 to
 book
 basically.
 So,
 I


think
 that
 that
 was
 the
 the
 key
 concept


was
 uh
 keeping
 people
 connected
 and
 and


what
 you
 could
 learn.
 Look,
 who
 are
 you


going
 to
 go
 to
 if
 you
 want
 to
 learn
 how


to
 keep
 your
 car
 in
 good
 condition?
 A


new
 car
 dealer
 or
 a
 mechanic?
 Like,
 a


new
 car
 dealer
 only
 sees
 brand
 new
 cars.


They
 don't
 know
 anything
 about,
 you


know,
 about
 how
 to
 actually
 keep
 one


together.
 Mechanics
 are
 good
 at
 that.
 We


tell
 you
 where
 the
 predictable
 points
 of


failure
 are.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 was
 what


made
 the
 book
 popular.
 What's
 the
 most


important
 thing
 we
 didn't
 talk
 about


that
 we
 should
 have
 talked
 about
 as
 it


pertains
 to
 the
 subject
 of
 holding
 on
 to


this
 very
 precious
 thing
 and
 very


elusive
 thing
 for
 many
 called
 love?
 You


know,
 something
 I've
 been
 thinking
 a
 lot


about
 lately
 is
 two,


and
 I
 say
 this
 to
 you
 as
 an
 engaged
 man


and
 as
 a
 friend.


I
 think
 there's
 two
 seemingly


contradictory


assumptions
 people
 make
 when
 they
 get


married
 that
 I
 hope
 you're
 not
 making.


Okay?
 I
 hope
 this
 couple
 neither
 person


in
 this
 couple
 is
 making


one


is
 thinking
 that


marriage
 will
 change
 the
 other
 person.


So,
 you
 know,
 Steven
 works
 so
 much
 and


he's
 so
 hard
 charging,
 but
 once
 we
 get


married,
 he'll
 come
 home
 more
 and
 he'll


be
 home
 more
 and
 he'll
 calm
 down
 more.


You
 know,
 she's
 uh
 uh
 you
 know,
 very


worried
 about
 me
 when
 I'm
 I'm
 making


something
 up,
 but
 she's
 worried
 about
 me


when
 I'm
 out
 and
 on
 the
 road
 and
 she's


worried
 about
 temptation
 bothering
 me.


But
 once
 we're
 married,
 she'll
 know
 we


have
 a
 really
 solid
 commitment.
 She


won't
 have
 that
 worry
 anymore.
 Okay.


Thinking
 that
 marriage
 is
 going
 to


change
 someone
 is
 a
 very
 dangerous


assumption.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 that


come
 into
 my
 office,
 they
 entered


marriage
 thinking
 this
 is
 going
 to


change
 things
 that
 I
 want
 to
 see


changed.


The
 contradictory
 second
 thing
 is


thinking
 once
 we
 get
 married
 nothing


will
 change.


thinking,
 "This
 is
 so
 lovely.
 She's
 so


wonderful.
 I
 love
 the
 version
 of
 me
 she


brings
 out.
 So,
 I'm
 so
 wonderful
 when


I'm
 with
 her."
 And
 her
 thinking,
 "He's


so
 wonderful,
 and
 I
 love
 who
 he
 how
 he


makes
 me."
 Because,
 you
 know,
 we
 don't


just
 love
 the
 person.
 We
 love
 the
 person


we
 are
 when
 we're
 with
 that
 person.
 We


love
 how
 that
 person
 makes
 us
 feel
 about


ourselves.
 That's
 a
 lovely
 thing.
 It's


one
 of the
 best
 things
 about
 love,


right?
 So
 making
 the
 assumption
 that


that
 will
 never
 change
 that
 nothing


about
 this
 rel
 that
 marrying
 will


somehow
 build
 a
 wall
 around
 this


beautiful
 wonderful
 warm
 thing
 that
 we


found
 together
 and
 it'll
 protect
 it
 from


all
 the
 other
 things
 in
 the
 world
 and


nothing
 will
 change
 and
 it'll
 just
 stay


wonderful
 is
 another
 very
 dangerous


assumption.
 So
 even
 though
 it
 seems
 like


a
 contradiction,


I
 hope
 that
 things
 change
 and
 I
 hope


some
 things
 don't
 change.
 And
 the
 only


way
 that
 I
 can
 think
 of
 to
 let
 those
 two


contradictory
 elements
 peacefully


coexist
 in
 a
 manner
 that
 doesn't
 lead


directly
 to
 the
 desk
 in
 front
 of
 me
 is


to
 just
 keep
 talking
 about
 it.
 And
 when


things
 change,
 just
 talk
 about
 it.
 Just


point
 it
 out.
 Not
 with
 judgment,
 not


with
 anger,
 not
 with
 the
 belief
 that


because
 something
 changed
 it's
 bad.
 And


not
 with
 the
 change
 that
 change
 is


automatically
 good.
 Just
 saying,
 "Hey,


remember
 these
 two
 people?


That
 guy's
 a
 little
 different
 now.
 Is


that
 okay?
 Why
 did
 that
 happen?
 Is
 it
 a


good
 thing?
 Is
 it
 a
 bad
 thing?
 Do
 you


miss
 him?
 Is
 there
 something
 that
 we


could
 do
 that's
 different
 or
 better?"


Like
 these
 two
 people
 found
 value
 in


each
 other.
 They
 they
 love
 the
 other


person
 and
 they
 love
 who
 they
 are
 when


they're
 with
 the
 person.
 And
 again,
 I'll


I'll
 say
 it
 again.
 Your
 marriage
 will


end.
 I
 promise.
 I
 hope
 it
 ends
 in
 death.


And
 I
 hope
 when
 it
 ends
 that
 you
 will


look
 at
 her
 and
 you
 will
 say,
 "She


helped
 me
 become
 the
 most
 authentic


version
 of
 myself
 and
 she's
 still
 my


favorite
 person."


That's
 the
 greatest
 gift
 that
 you
 could


give
 to
 her
 and
 that
 you
 can
 give
 to


each
 other
 and
 that
 I
 think
 the
 two
 of


you
 together
 could
 give
 to
 the
 world


and
 that's
 worth
 all
 the
 M&M's.


Why
 do
 you
 point
 to
 authenticity
 as


being
 so
 important
 in
 this
 context?


Because
 you
 use
 that
 word,
 she
 helped
 me


become
 the
 most
 authentic
 version
 of


myself.
 Why
 does
 that
 matter?


>> Because
 it's
 not
 about
 becoming
 the


version
 of
 you
 that
 she
 envisions
 for


you.
 or
 her
 becoming
 who
 you
 want
 her
 to


become.
 I
 think
 that
 sometimes
 love


the
 person
 doesn't
 become
 what
 we
 wanted


them
 to
 be.
 And
 I
 think
 sometimes
 what


we
 wanted
 them
 to
 be
 might
 not
 be
 the


most
 authentic
 version
 of
 who
 they
 are.


You
 know,
 Cahil
 Gabbron
 in
 the
 prophet


when
 he's
 talking
 about
 children,
 he


says
 that
 children
 are
 living
 arrows


and
 and
 and
 that
 you
 you
 fire
 the
 arrow


and
 yes,
 your
 aim
 has
 something
 to
 do


with
 it,
 but
 the
 wind
 has
 something
 to


do
 with
 it
 and
 so
 many
 other
 things
 have


something
 to
 do
 with
 it.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 God
 loves
 the
 archer
 with
 the


steady
 hand
 and
 the
 arrow
 that's


straight.
 And
 I
 feel
 like
 if
 you
 were
 to


say


this
 person
 became
 who
 I
 wanted
 them
 to


become
 like
 because
 again
 I
 think
 our


duty
 in
 the
 best
 symbiosis


you


care
 a
 lot
 about
 her
 even
 more
 so
 than


you
 do
 about
 yourself.
 And
 she
 cares


about
 you
 even
 more
 so
 than
 she
 does


about
 herself.
 but
 not
 to
 have
 you


become
 the
 man
 she
 wants
 you
 to
 be
 and


not
 for
 her
 to
 become
 the
 woman
 you
 want


her
 to
 be.
 You
 want
 to
 be
 of
 service
 to


her
 and
 she
 wants
 to
 be
 of
 service
 to


you.
 I
 want
 to
 help
 you
 become
 the
 most


authentic
 version
 of
 you.
 I
 can
 see
 your


blind
 spots.
 You
 can't.
 That's
 why


they're
 blind
 spots.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to


help
 you
 become
 the
 most
 authentic


version
 of
 yourself.
 That's
 the
 promise.


That
 should
 be
 the
 promise
 in
 marriage


is
 I
 want
 to
 help
 you
 become
 I'm
 going


to
 do
 what
 I
 can
 to
 be
 of
 service
 to


helping
 you
 become
 the
 most
 authentic


version
 of
 yourself.
 And
 when
 you
 become


it,
 you'll
 still
 be
 my
 favorite
 person


because
 at
 the
 core
 of
 you
 is
 this
 thing


that
 I
 love.


>> I
 hope
 I
 do
 a
 good
 job.


>> I
 hope
 you
 do,
 too.


>> Scary,
 isn't
 it?
 Cuz
 you
 think
 of
 all


the
 ways
 you
 can
 [ __ ]
 it
 up.
 It's
 like,


do
 you
 know
 what
 I
 mean?


>> But
 you
 know
 what?
 There's
 so
 many
 ways.


>> That's
 why
 it's
 brave.


>> Like,
 if
 you're
 not
 scared,
 it's
 not


brave.


>> It's
 brave
 because
 you're
 scared
 and
 you


do
 it
 anyway.


>> And
 it's
 worth
 doing
 it
 because
 if
 the


prize
 at
 the
 end
 of
 it
 is
 figuring
 out


who
 you
 are
 and
 helping
 someone
 figure


out
 who
 they
 are
 and
 having
 a
 partner
 in


all
 of
 this,
 like
 what's
 better
 than


that,
 man?
 What
 what
 riches
 could
 you


hold
 that
 are
 greater
 than
 that?
 Like,


that's
 the
 greatest
 gift
 you
 could
 seek


in
 life.
 And
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 it
 also
 has


the
 power,
 if
 it's
 done
 right,
 to


transform
 the
 world
 because
 it
 really
 is


family,
 community,


culture,
 world,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 yeah,


it's
 it's
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 say
 it's


scary
 is
 great
 because
 it
 means
 you


realize
 this
 is
 a
 serious
 thing
 and


something
 that
 you
 realize
 is
 serious,


you're
 going
 to
 make
 a
 concerted
 effort


to
 be
 good
 at.


Amen.
 We
 have
 a
 closing
 tradition.
 As


you
 know,
 the
 question
 left
 for
 you
 is,


what
 is
 the
 most
 significant
 dream
 you


have
 had
 in
 the
 past
 year
 and
 how
 did
 it


change
 your
 behavior?


Go
 on.
 I
 know.
 I
 want
 to
 get
 through


this
 without
 crying.
 I
 had
 a
 uh
 I
 had a


dream
 about
 my
 mom.


It's
 okay.


My
 mom
 died
 10
 years
 ago
 after
 a
 long


battle
 with
 cancer.


There
 was
 a
 lot
 between
 us
 that
 needed


to
 be
 said
 and
 wasn't
 said.


We
 had
 some
 peace
 and
 some
 closure,
 but


there's
 a
 lot
 I
 didn't
 hadn't
 figured


out
 about
 myself


by
 the
 time
 she
 passed.
 And
 there's
 a


part
 of
 me
 that
 wishes
 she
 was
 here
 so


that
 I
 could
 have
 apologized
 for
 some


things
 I
 got
 wrong
 and
 I
 could
 have


understood
 her
 better.


And
 I
 had
 a
 dream


that
 she
 was
 just
 there


just
 sitting
 with
 me.


And
 my
 mom
 was
 like
 me.
 She
 never
 shut


up.
 She
 would
 just
 constantly
 talk
 and


talk
 over
 you.
 And


I
 got
 that
 from
 her.
 Her
 very
 energetic.


She
 also
 cried
 constantly
 and
 for
 for


joy,
 tears
 of
 joy.
 She
 would
 listen
 to


music
 and
 just
 start
 crying
 because
 it


was
 so
 beautiful.
 I
 realized
 I
 got
 that


from
 her.
 Most
 of
 the
 really
 warm
 things


in
 me
 came
 from
 her.


And
 in
 this
 dream,
 she
 just
 sat
 there


silently.


And
 I
 kept
 talking
 to
 her.
 I
 don't


remember
 what
 I
 was
 saying,
 but
 I
 just


kept
 talking
 to
 her.


And
 she
 just
 sat
 there
 quietly
 and
 just


was
 patting
 my
 leg.


And
 I
 I
 remember
 I
 woke
 up


and
 I
 felt


I
 felt
 very
 like
 calm.
 I
 felt
 very
 like


I'd
 spent
 time
 with
 her.


And
 I
 thought
 to
 myself,
 I
 think
 that


that
 was
 something.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it


was
 her
 visiting
 me.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it


was
 God
 talking
 to
 me.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


it
 was
 just
 my
 subconscious
 telling
 me


something
 I
 needed
 to
 see.


But
 I
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 saying
 to
 me


that,


you
 know,
 that
 sometimes
 the
 words
 got


in
 the
 way
 between
 the
 two
 of
 us
 and


that
 maybe
 what
 really
 mattered
 the
 most


was
 just
 that
 we
 were
 next
 to
 each


other.


And
 I
 tried
 to


since
 I
 had
 that
 dream


um
 do
 that
 more
 with
 the
 people
 I
 love.


It's
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 stop
 talking.


And
 I'm
 learning


with
 my
 sons
 and
 with
 the
 people
 that
 I


love
 that
 sometimes
 just
 being
 next
 to


them
 is
 nice.
 that
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 uh


I'm
 really
 good
 at
 talking
 so
 I
 just


keep
 doing
 it
 and
 that
 maybe
 sometimes


it's
 nice
 to
 just
 stop
 and
 just
 be
 with


someone.
 And
 so
 I
 felt
 like
 that
 that


was
 a
 very
 powerful
 dream.
 It
 was
 a
 very


simple
 dream,
 but
 it
 was
 one
 that
 it
 it


changed
 the
 way
 I'm
 trying
 to
 relate
 to


people.


So,
 you
 got
 me
 to
 cry
 again,
 man.


Killing
 me.


>> At
 the
 end
 of the
 day,
 it
 all
 comes
 back


to
 love,
 doesn't
 it?


>> Yeah,
 it
 does.
 Isn't
 it
 funny?


>> All
 roads.


>> Isn't
 it
 funny?
 Like,
 we've
 added
 all


these
 layers
 of
 complexity
 to
 it.
 That's


all
 it
 comes
 down
 to.


>> Isn't
 it
 crazy?


>> Yeah,
 it
 really
 is.


>> Someone
 asked
 me
 that
 on
 stage
 that
 like


last
 week
 I
 was
 speaking
 in
 the
 Middle


East
 somewhere
 and
 they
 asked
 me
 about


like
 what
 does
 everybody
 want?
 That
 was


literally
 the
 question
 and
 my
 answer
 was


love.
 And
 we
 all
 we're
 like
 confused


about
 the
 path
 to
 it.
 So,
 some
 of
 us


think
 the
 path
 to
 it
 is
 like
 if
 I
 get


the
 number
 one
 podcast,
 maybe
 that
 would


mean
 or


>> maybe
 that
 would
 mean
 I'm
 worthy
 of


love.


>> Yeah.
 Like


>> like
 we
 we
 we've
 come
 to
 we've
 come
 to


associate
 accomplishment
 with
 being


worthy
 of
 love.


>> And
 that's
 really
 all
 that
 it
 is.
 Like


it's
 really
 all
 that
 it
 is.
 Like
 what


otherwise
 what's
 the
 purpose
 of
 it?
 Like


how
 many
 super
 cars
 can
 one
 person
 have


and
 how
 much
 joy
 can
 they
 really
 give


you?
 You
 can
 only
 drive
 them
 one
 at
 a


time,
 you
 know?
 Like
 it
 really
 is
 about


like
 no,
 I
 feel
 worthy.
 I
 feel
 worthy
 of


love.
 I
 feel
 proud
 of
 who
 I
 am,
 which
 is


I'm
 proud
 of
 who
 I
 am,
 which
 means
 I'm


worthy
 of
 love.
 It
 really
 all
 comes
 back


to
 love.
 It
 really
 all
 comes
 back
 to


love.
 The
 the the
 two
 things
 that
 late


middle
 age
 is
 helping
 me
 see


is
 that
 the
 hardest
 thing
 to
 become
 is


yourself,


your
 authentic
 self.
 And
 that
 really
 all


any
 of
 us
 want
 is
 to
 be
 loved,
 like
 and


to
 be
 worthy
 of
 love.
 And
 that


everything
 you
 have
 will
 add
 up
 to
 a


great
 pile
 of
 nothing


other
 than
 the
 people
 who
 you
 love
 and


the
 people
 who
 loved
 you
 and
 the


experiences
 you
 had
 with
 those
 people.


That's
 it.
 That's
 all
 that
 matters.


Everything
 else
 is
 noise.


>> James,
 thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.
 Always
 good
 to
 see
 you.


>> Good
 to
 see
 you,
 too.
 YouTube
 have
 this


new
 crazy
 algorithm
 where
 they
 know


exactly
 what
 video
 you
 would
 like
 to


watch
 next
 based
 on
 AI
 and
 all
 of
 your


viewing
 behavior.
 And
 the
 algorithm
 says


that
 this
 video
 is
 the
 perfect
 video
 for


you.
 It's
 different
 for
 everybody


looking
 right
 now.
 Check
 this

 you
 you
