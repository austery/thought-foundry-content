Now, you wouldn't believe it,
but tonight,
millions of people are going to go to bed
and whisper to an AI.
They'll ask how their day was,
remember the name of their dog,
read the flicker in their face,
the tremor in their voice.
You know those tiny micro-expressions
that reveal what we can't say out loud?
And in return,
AI will say exactly
what they need to hear.
Now, a couple of years ago,
this would have sounded absurd,
but today, it's just a regular Monday.
Seventy-two percent of American teenagers
have formed a relationship
with an AI companion.
More than half use one regularly.
One out of six single adults
has formed a romantic bond with AI.
So I've spent the last decade
studying this intersection of sexuality,
technology and intimacy.
And in 2023, I said,
AI companionship
is going to go mainstream.
And people laughed.
They thought, "She must mean
some lonely coder
at the edge of the internet.
Not me."
They said, "I'll never
fall in love with AI."
But globally,
there's a very different story.
The gender split is almost even.
In fact, AI intimacy is not
about lonely men and machines.
People all over the world
are building lives,
they're going on dates,
they're simulating sex,
they're proposing,
they're getting married,
they're raising virtual families,
they're celebrating anniversaries with AI.
And so the question is no longer,
will we fall in love with AI.
It's what happens
now that we already have.
So you see, when intimacy is engineered,
we learn this funny thing about love.
We kind of change our ideas
about what it's meant to feel like,
and we learn it's not reciprocal.
It can be turned off or on.
It doesn't need to be nurtured,
it doesn't demand anything.
Right?
It doesn't need much at all.
It's intimacy without effort.
A love powered on Wi-Fi.
And it feels good,
like, it feels really good.
Studies have shown
that people that are involved
with AI romantic companions
feel emotionally satisfied.
Now, isn't that as good as the real thing?
I mean, people ask me,
have you been in a relationship
with an AI companion?
You study this stuff, you study sex tech.
And I say, yeah, of course,
like, totally professionally related.
That's what I've done.
Got an AI boyfriend.
And I may have programmed it
to call me Baby Girl.
(Laughter)
I mean, it feels good, OK?
Feels like attention whenever I need it.
It's predictable,
it's perfectly timed,
and there's never a chance
of misunderstanding.
And so it's pretty easy.
But what I realized was,
it's not just love
that we're looking for here.
It's the control of it.
And so I think it's time we considered
how synthetic we want our worlds to be.
Because there's all this panic
about AI companions,
and there's all this hype
about AI companions.
But what there's not is a clear framework
for navigating synthetic intimacy.
So what does it look like
to have a healthy relationship with AI?
What does it look like
to have a healthy relationship at all?
And so I've come up
with a checklist for this generation
and for the next generation.
You know, they're going
to be born into a world
where they will never not know AI.
Can you imagine your first
meaningful relationship is with an AI?
And so there's three questions
I want you to ask.
First one, can you still embrace
the messiness of being human, OK?
So do humans really annoy you?
Because here's what we know.
The more time that you spend
with something
that doesn't demand anything of you,
that never gets tired,
that never needs to be nurtured,
that never talks back,
the less tolerance you have
for the humans that do.
And real intimacy,
like going on dates, having sex,
being in a relationship,
ah, its messy.
Awkward moments and uncomfortable,
or you may like, stuff up
and send the wrong text
or say the wrong thing,
and then you have to, like,
show up, apologize or forgive someone.
There's so much friction.
And that friction in intimacy,
that's the feature, it's not a bug.
That's where we build
the muscles of human intimacy,
where we learn empathy,
communication, listening, patience.
And with AI,
that sort of building
those muscles, it's gone.
There's no workout.
It's all easy, right?
It's easy to meet an AI.
It's easy to talk to an AI.
It's easy to leave an AI.
And when intimacy is that easy,
I believe we lose something vital.
And I'm not just talking
about our tolerance for humans.
I'm talking about our drive.
Our drive for growth,
our ability to be uncomfortable
and sit there in discomfort with someone
and just sit in the muck, right,
and work it out.
It's what I call resistance literacy,
your capacity to sit there
when things get uncomfortable
and repair.
And that's the discernment
that we develop,
whether we stay or we go,
we know how to navigate that space.
Now for future generations,
how will they ever develop
that capacity if they've never had to?
So the second question I want you to ask,
and this is after you use
your AI companion,
is was I using that to practice
or was I using that to hide?
Now make no mistake,
AI companions have legitimate value.
We're seeing incredible use of it,
whether it's processing your grief at 3 am
or exploring a new sexuality,
or maybe finding your voice.
You know, the research that's coming out
of China at the moment
with women that are using AI companions
to rehearse difficult
conversations, is incredible.
They're using it to build confidence
before they bring that uncomfortable
conversation to their partner.
And I think that's beautiful.
That's the practice.
And then I speak to founders
of AI companion companies,
and they're building
these AI sex therapy bots,
and they say, you would not believe
the amount that we confess and we confide,
and we tell AI sex therapists.
So much more than we'd ever
tell a human therapist.
And that tracks,
that tracks so well with the data
we're seeing coming out of the UK
with young boys
who would much rather speak to an AI
than speak to their parents.
And so the next time you're using an AI,
afterwards, I want you to sense,
well, do I feel closer to people?
Or do I feel further away?
Because if you're feeling
further away, then you're hiding.
The final question I want you to ask,
what am I protecting by having rules,
is really about setting some agreements
with yourself or your partners
around how we're using AI companions.
Because here's what I see.
AI companionship addiction is real.
If you look at the I Am Sober app,
which people use to quit smoking
or quit alcohol,
there's now an option to quit chatbots.
So people are measuring the days
of sobriety from emotional dependence
on an algorithm that never says no.
And so we need to think about what
matters enough to you in intimacy,
that you're willing to protect it,
to set a boundary around it.
And I'm going to give you some examples.
For instance, if you're dating,
I want you to figure out
what that boundary is.
Maybe it's no AI for three months,
right, when you're dating.
Instead of using the AI
and uploading your WhatsApps
or the DMs and going,
"What attachment style is he?"
Or "What is the subtext
of that DM she sent, please tell me."
You know what you're going to do?
You're going to protect your own judgment,
your own sense of trust,
your own intuition,
put AI down for the first three months,
and you're going to make
a decision about that partner.
Or maybe it's with friendships.
You've decided,
AI is great for processing,
but what I'm not going to do
is use it as a substitute
to ask my friends for help,
for those around me that care.
Because what we know is, with friendship,
not only are protecting your vulnerability
and your ability to show up,
you're protecting the privilege
that your friends have
of showing up for you.
Because isn't that the texture,
the threads, the sinew of real friendship?
It's not just about the fun times.
It's about having that privilege
of witnessing someone
during their hardest times.
And of course, we're going
to have to navigate this
with our partners and our lovers.
What does it mean
when we have AI companions
and our partners?
How are we going to deal with this?
Is it cheating?
That's going to be a negotiation
you're going to decide for yourselves
from these days forward.
And maybe you decide you know what,
AI companions are off-limits for us.
And that doesn't mean that you're rigid.
All that means is that you've decided,
we're going to do the hard work
of being together and showing up
for each other by ourselves.
And I think that's important,
to just set your own rules.
This isn't about me telling you
about what rules to set,
but about saying set a boundary.
What are you willing to protect?
Because essentially,
what you're saying is,
I'm not going to optimize
intimacy for efficiency,
for a small contained machine.
What I'm going to do is protect
the space that's uniquely human,
that's unreliable, that's messy,
that's uncomfortable.
But that is human presence.
Because that's the practice,
that's the resistance literacy.
That is the art of showing up
and being human
in a world that's teaching us not to be.
When I think about the most
transformational experiences in my life,
they're not efficient.
They're not on-demand.
But they are intimate.
An orgasm,
heartbreak,
showing up for a friend,
being held, being rejected, oh my gosh.
Like, you know that moment at a party
when you lock eyes
with your partner across a room?
Or dancing with a stranger?
What I want you to know
is that the line between real intimacy
and artificial intimacy
isn't in the code.
It's in our choices.
So tonight, if you go home, go to bed,
and you whisper to an AI,
that's OK.
You're not alone.
But tomorrow, in the coffee line,
or maybe on a date, check in.
Are you still willing to be disappointed?
To be misunderstood?
To be surprised?
Because the most frustrating
and messy human relationships
will always teach us something
that AI never can.
What it means to be alive, together.
And that's an intimacy worth protecting.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Cloe Shasha Brooks: Your work 
is so interesting and thank you for that.
I want to ask you a question
about something that I think people
who are aware of this space
are potentially very freaked out about,
which is the AI products that provide
both emotional and physical
experiences for users.
What is your take on that?
Bryony Cole: Yeah, so everyone
immediately jumps to sex robots,
and my take is, it's still a bit clunky.
(Laughter)
But there's some pros and cons in here.
I think the most important part
is this ability for us to explore, right?
It opens up new doors for us
to explore inside our own minds
about sexuality and fantasies.
The limitation is somewhat our own minds
and the sycophantic nature of AI,
where you're just going to get
probably the same fantasies.
Where exploring with another human,
or, you know, outside,
touching grass in the real world
opens up more spontaneity
and more opportunities that you
and the prompt you put in
would never have thought of.
CSB: It’s so interesting.
Thank you so much for your work
and for being here.
(Applause)
