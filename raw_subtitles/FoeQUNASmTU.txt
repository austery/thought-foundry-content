If
 your
 goal
 is
 to
 become
 financially


independent
 at
 a
 young
 age,
 this
 is
 a


very
 controversial
 thing
 to
 say,
 you


probably
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 buy
 a
 house


because
 people
 typically
 buy
 a
 house


they
 can't
 possibly
 afford.
 The
 bank


wants
 you
 to
 do
 that
 cuz
 that's
 how
 they


make
 the
 most
 money.
 So,
 you're
 putting


your
 capital
 into
 that
 house
 and
 now


it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 earning
 thing.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 sitting
 idally.
 And
 people


say,
 "Well,
 you
 know,
 I
 can
 buy
 this


house
 cuz
 my
 mortgage
 is
 the
 same
 as
 my


rent."
 Well,
 yeah,
 but
 your
 mortgage
 is


just
 the
 starting
 point.
 So,
 what
 comes


to
 mind
 if
 I
 want
 to
 be
 financially


wealthy?


>> Okay,
 so
 we've
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 go
 through.


>> J
 Collins
 is
 a
 renowned
 financial
 expert


known
 for
 his
 book,
 The
 Simple
 Path
 to


Wealth.


>> He's
 teaching
 millions
 a
 straightforward


and
 realistic
 avenue
 for
 achieving


wealth


>> so
 that
 anyone
 can
 have
 financial


security.


>> What
 is
 the
 simple
 path
 to
 wealth?


>> So,
 first
 of
 all,
 avoid
 debt
 because
 you


can
 never
 be
 financially
 independent
 if


you're
 carrying
 around
 debt.
 Next,
 live


on
 less
 than
 you
 [music]
 earn.
 But
 the


problem
 is
 the
 way
 our
 culture
 has


taught
 us
 to
 think
 about
 money
 is
 solely


in
 terms
 of
 what
 can
 you
 buy
 with
 it.


But
 the
 more
 musthaves
 you
 have
 in
 your


life,
 the
 less
 likely
 you
 are
 to
 become


wealthy.
 And
 then
 the
 final
 one,
 invest


the
 surplus.
 So
 stocks
 are
 the
 single


most
 effective,
 strongest
 wealth


building
 tool
 that's
 ever
 been
 created.


But
 the
 biggest
 push
 back
 I
 get
 is
 from


people
 who
 say,
 "Well,
 that's
 great.
 I


mean,
 if
 you
 got
 a
 big
 income,
 100,
 200,


$300,000
 a
 year,
 then
 yeah,
 the
 simple


path
 to
 wealth
 will
 work
 for
 you."


That's
 not
 the
 truth.
 For
 instance,
 a


friend
 of
 mine
 and
 he
 was
 making
 a


million
 dollars
 a
 year
 and
 he
 was
 broke


because
 people
 have
 large
 incomes
 are


much
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 drawn
 into
 the


competing
 with
 the
 Joneses,
 whereas
 the


people
 who
 make
 less
 money
 probably


don't
 have
 those
 same
 social
 pressures


and
 are
 more
 readily
 able
 to
 do
 it.
 So,


>> let's
 talk
 about
 investing
 then.
 Where


do
 you
 think
 we
 should
 be
 investing
 our


money
 at
 this
 moment
 of
 time?
 Should
 I


buy
 Bitcoin?
 Do
 I
 need
 a
 financial


adviser?
 So,
 my
 advice,
 and
 this
 is
 a


little
 different
 than
 the
 more
 common


advice
 out
 there,
 would
 be


>> this
 has
 always
 blown
 my
 mind
 a
 little


bit.

[music and singing]


JL
 Collins,


you
 wrote
 a
 book,
 a
 very
 iconic
 book


that
 sold
 millions
 of
 copies
 called
 The


Simple
 Path
 to
 Wealth.
 Why
 did
 you
 write


this
 book?


>> I
 actually
 that
 book
 was
 an
 outgrowth
 of


my
 blog.


I
 started
 the
 blog
 to
 archive


information
 I
 wanted
 my
 daughter
 to
 have


available
 because
 if
 you
 get
 money


right,
 your
 life
 is
 so
 much
 better.
 You


have
 so
 many
 more
 options.
 And
 the
 world


offers
 so
 much
 to
 people
 who
 have
 the


resources
 with
 which
 to
 access
 it
 and
 so


little
 for
 those
 people
 who
 don't
 have


the
 resources
 to
 access
 those
 things.


And
 and
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 it,
 it
 life
 is


just
 so
 much
 harder
 than
 it
 than
 it


needs
 to
 be.


>> When
 you
 think
 about
 the
 average
 person


listening
 right
 now,
 what
 is
 what
 are


some
 of
 the
 fundamental
 sort
 of


misconceptions
 or
 misunderstandings
 or


what
 would
 you
 call
 it?
 Black
 spots
 that


they
 have
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 money,
 the


things
 they
 walk
 around
 assuming
 about


money
 that
 are
 incorrect


>> that
 that
 you
 were
 maybe
 trying
 to
 get


out
 of
 your
 daughter's
 mind.


>> Right?
 So
 there's
 a
 chapter
 in
 the
 book


called
 how
 to
 think
 about
 money.
 And
 the


fundamental
 way
 I
 think
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 people
 think
 about
 money


because
 this
 is
 what
 our
 culture
 has


taught
 us.
 The
 way
 our
 culture
 has


taught
 us
 to
 think
 about
 money
 is
 solely


in
 terms
 of
 what
 can
 you
 buy
 with
 it.


[snorts]
 So
 if
 you
 go
 to
 the
 average


person
 that
 lottery
 for
 instance
 is
 like


a
 billion
 dollars
 at
 the
 moment.
 So


people
 are
 buying
 lottery
 tickets.
 And


if
 you
 interviewed
 people
 standing
 in


line
 to
 buy
 lottery
 tickets
 and
 said,


"Okay,
 if
 you
 win
 this
 million
 dollar,


what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 do
 with
 it?"
 Well,


what
 you're
 typically
 going
 to
 hear
 is,


"Well,
 I'm
 going
 to
 pay
 off
 my
 debts
 and


I'm
 going
 to
 pay
 off
 my
 mortgage
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 buy
 my
 parents
 a
 house
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 buy
 myself
 a
 Lamborghini.
 I'm


going
 to
 buy
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy
 I'm
 going


to
 buy."
 That's
 the
 way
 most
 people


think
 about
 money.
 And
 that's
 certainly


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 money
 is
 very


good
 at.
 It
 is
 a
 means
 of
 exchange.


But
 the
 other
 thing
 your
 money
 can
 do


for
 you
 is
 work
 for
 you.
 Your
 money
 can


make
 you
 more
 money.
 So
 you
 can
 exchange


your
 time
 and
 effort
 and
 labor
 to
 earn


money.
 And
 that's
 what
 most
 of
 us
 do.


But
 you
 can
 also
 divert
 some
 of
 the


money
 you
 earn
 into
 investments
 into


what
 I
 call
 buying
 your
 freedom.
 And
 now


your
 money
 is
 working
 for
 you.
 So


instead
 of
 just
 thinking
 about
 what
 your


money
 can
 buy,
 you
 can
 start
 thinking


about
 what
 can
 your
 money
 earn.


>> You
 can
 buy
 your
 freedom.


>> You
 can
 buy
 your
 freedom,
 your
 financial


freedom.


>> Why
 is
 that
 an
 important
 refraraming
 of


the
 role
 of
 money
 in
 your
 view?
 What


does
 that
 do
 if
 I
 start
 thinking
 about


it
 through
 that
 lens?
 Well,
 because
 as


long
 as
 you
 are
 dependent
 on
 exchanging


your
 effort,
 time,
 and
 labor
 for
 money,


you
 are
 beholden
 to
 whoever
 is
 willing


to
 pay
 you
 to
 do
 that.
 That's
 a
 limit
 of


freedom.
 It's
 a
 it's
 a
 form
 of,
 without


being
 too
 dramatic,
 a
 form
 of
 slavery.


If
 you
 are
 always
 living
 paycheck
 to


paycheck
 to
 pay
 the
 mortgage
 or
 the
 rent


or
 whatever,
 if
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 work


is
 optional,
 you're
 a
 good
 example.
 and


you've
 been
 a
 very
 successful
 guy.


[snorts]


You're
 not
 doing
 this
 podcast
 because


you
 need
 the
 money.
 If
 you
 were
 still


stuck
 at
 a
 job
 that
 paid
 you
 a
 wage,
 you


wouldn't
 have
 the
 option
 to
 do
 this


because
 you'd
 have
 to
 devote
 all
 your


time
 to
 that
 job
 so
 you
 could
 pay
 the


mortgage,
 so
 you
 could
 pay
 the
 rent,
 so


you
 could
 put
 food
 on
 the
 table.
 Money


buys
 freedom.


>> How
 does
 one
 get
 out
 of
 that
 situation?


you
 know,
 if
 I
 I
 used
 to
 work
 in
 call


centers
 um
 answering
 phones
 and
 selling


people
 things.


>> How
 does
 one
 in
 your
 view
 realistically


get
 from
 that
 place
 where
 you
 are
 kind


of
 beholden
 to
 the
 paycheck?
 And
 I
 was


I'd
 spend
 my
 wage
 within
 the
 first
 week


or
 so
 of
 the
 month
 and
 then
 I'd
 just


suffer
 for
 the
 next
 3
 weeks.
 In
 the
 UK,


we
 have
 like
 a
 four
 week
 paying
 cycle.
 I


think
 in
 the
 US
 it's
 2
 weeks
 typically,


but
 I
 took
 a
 I
 think
 a
 reckless
 road
 out


of
 that
 life.
 The
 thing
 that
 gave
 me
 the


proclivity
 to
 take
 the
 risk
 is
 like
 some


kind
 of
 insecurity
 and
 trauma
 where
 like


I
 couldn't
 I
 didn't
 have
 a
 plan
 B


because
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 I
 wanted
 to
 like


validate
 myself
 or
 something.
 And
 so
 I


wonder
 if
 the
 the
 skill
 or
 the
 thing


that
 I
 was
 given
 that
 I'm
 most
 thankful


for
 is
 like
 some
 kind
 of
 chip
 on
 my


shoulder,


>> some
 kind
 of
 drama.


>> Yeah.
 But
 but
 on
 genuinely
 because
 I


think
 like
 what
 would
 make
 you
 take
 a


risk
 like
 some
 of
 the
 risks
 that
 I
 took


to
 leave
 university
 to
 then
 like
 be
 be


broke
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 well,
 I
 just
 I
 was


driven
 I
 was
 dragged
 by
 some
 kind
 of


trauma.


>> Right?
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I've


observed,
 and
 I
 think
 to
 the
 extent
 that


I've
 had
 some
 success
 in
 my
 life,
 this


is
 true,
 that
 successful
 people
 do
 tend


to
 have
 trauma
 in
 their
 background.
 At


least
 that's
 my
 observation.
 Now,
 I'm


sure
 there
 are
 exceptions
 to
 that,
 but


it
 does
 seem
 that
 people
 like
 us
 are


striving
 to
 overcome


those
 past
 traumas,
 to
 have
 that
 chip
 on


the
 shoulder,
 to
 prove
 something.


I've
 also
 met
 people
 who
 are
 very


content
 to
 be
 completely
 lacking
 in


ambition


and
 to
 have
 enough
 to
 have
 a
 comfortable


life
 and
 kind
 of
 do
 what
 they
 want
 to
 do


to
 have
 financial
 independence
 maybe
 but


they
 don't
 have
 this
 drive
 to
 be


successful
 to
 to
 make
 a
 mark
 on
 on
 the


world
 and
 they
 tend
 to
 have
 had
 better


childhoods
 and
 and
 uh
 and
 I
 think
 that


there
 is
 that
 wasn't
 me.
 That
 doesn't


appear
 to
 be
 you.
 But
 I
 think
 there's
 a


lot
 to
 be
 said
 for
 for
 that,
 right?


>> You
 I
 mean
 you
 open
 the
 book
 about


talking
 about
 a
 parable
 of
 the
 monk


>> and
 the
 minister


>> and
 the
 minister.


>> Yeah.


>> Can
 you
 uh
 tell
 me
 about
 that
 parable


because
 it
 seems
 to
 somewhat
 relate
 to


what
 we're
 seeing
 here.
 I
 think


>> very
 very
 much
 so
 and
 that's
 the
 reason


I
 open
 the
 book
 with
 it.
 So
 the
 parable


is
 there
 are
 these
 uh
 two
 boys
 who
 grew


up
 together.
 their
 childhood
 friends.
 As


frequently
 happens,
 they
 go
 their


different
 directions
 in
 life
 as
 they


become
 adults.
 And
 one
 becomes
 a
 very


successful,
 powerful
 minister
 to
 the


king,
 and
 the
 other
 becomes
 a
 humble


monk
 in
 tattered
 robes
 with
 a
 begging


bowl
 and
 what
 have
 you.
 And
 years
 later,


they
 run
 into
 each
 other
 on
 the
 road.


And
 they're
 getting
 reacquainted.


And
 as
 they
 are,
 the
 minister,
 the
 king,


takes
 pity
 on
 on
 his
 povertystricken


friend
 and
 his
 tattered
 robes.
 And
 he


says,
 'You
 know,
 if
 you
 could
 learn
 to


cater
 to
 the
 king,
 you
 wouldn't
 have
 to


live
 on
 rice
 and
 beans.
 To
 which
 the


monk
 replies,
 if
 you
 could
 learn
 to
 live


on
 rice
 and
 beans,


you
 wouldn't
 have
 to
 cater
 to
 the
 king.


And
 for
 me,
 I've
 always
 been
 a
 little


bit
 more
 towards
 the
 monk
 side.
 I'm
 uh


I'm
 not
 a
 very
 materialistic
 person,
 and


I'm
 comfortable
 and
 able
 to
 get
 along
 on


on
 very
 little.
 And
 I
 think
 there's


something
 beautiful
 about
 needing
 less.


>> I
 have
 from
 my
 interviews
 met
 people
 who


are
 very
 wealthy,
 even
 actually
 off


camera,


>> who
 are
 very,
 very
 wealthy
 and
 appear
 to


be
 happy.
 Yes.


>> But
 I
 think
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 safe
 to
 say


that
 the
 richest
 people
 I
 know
 are


amongst
 the
 least
 happy
 people
 I
 know.


So
 if
 I
 think
 about
 the
 very
 top,
 the


billionaires
 that
 I
 know
 off
 camera,


>> they
 are
 amongst
 the
 least
 happy


typically.


>> Mhm.
 Um
 because
 I
 think
 whatever's
 taken


them
 there
 is
 still
 haunting
 them
 while


they're
 there.
 So
 it
 could
 be
 the
 chip


on
 the
 shoulder,
 the
 insecurity,


whatever
 happened
 to
 them
 that
 made
 them


so
 driven
 and
 obsessed
 with
 validation


and
 climbing
 is
 still
 haunting
 them
 now.


But
 I
 do
 also
 I
 do
 know
 people
 like
 I


say
 that
 are
 very
 very
 rich
 and
 that


live
 remarkably
 content
 lives.
 And
 I


think
 part
 of
 it
 is
 their
 relationship


with
 the
 stuff.
 Like
 I
 think
 it
 is


possible


>> and
 they
 probably
 keep
 it
 at
 arms


length,
 right?
 They're
 a
 little
 psychic


distance
 from
 the
 stuff.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 just
 speaking
 from
 my
 own


journey
 at
 a
 very
 young
 age
 up
 until
 the


age
 of
 25,
 I
 was
 convinced
 that
 buying
 a


Range
 Rover
 Sport
 was
 going
 to
 like


really
 make
 me
 really
 happy.
 And
 um
 the


anti-limax
 once
 I
 I
 got
 those
 things
 was


was
 like
 it
 was
 staggering.
 It
 was
 a


complete


>> mental
 it
 was
 like
 someone
 had
 shaken
 my


head.
 My
 reality
 distorted
 for
 a
 second


because
 I
 thought
 this
 was
 meant
 to
 be


it.


>> And
 now
 I
 can
 still
 get
 things
 that
 I


like.
 But
 um
 I
 was
 saying
 to
 Will
 the


other
 day
 that
 when
 I
 walked
 into
 my
 new


house
 in
 LA
 um
 I
 had
 pre-repped
 myself


to
 know
 that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 have
 zero


impact
 on
 my
 happiness
 and
 that
 meant


that
 I
 actually
 enjoyed
 it
 weirdly.


>> Right.


>> Like
 I
 was
 actually
 super
 grateful


because
 I'd
 pre-repped
 myself
 to
 have
 a


healthier
 relationship
 with
 the
 thing


>> to
 bring
 the
 expectation
 down.


>> Exactly.


>> So
 there
 are
 a
 couple
 things
 at
 play


there.
 I
 think
 one
 is
 it's
 the
 journey


that's
 really
 satisfying.


>> The
 destination
 tends
 to
 be
 less
 so.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 problems
 with


being
 very
 materialistic
 because
 you


know
 if
 your
 definition
 of
 happiness
 is


if
 I
 only
 owned
 this
 watch,
 right?
 If
 I


only
 had
 this
 watch
 maker
 make
 me
 this


intricate
 watch,
 then
 I
 would
 be
 happy.


Well,
 I
 mean
 maybe,
 but
 probably
 not.


You're
 probably
 going
 to
 have
 that


watch.
 You're
 going
 to
 look
 at
 it
 and


say,
 "That's
 really
 nice.
 Wow,
 that's


good."
 And
 it'll
 and
 then
 well,
 what's


next?
 But
 if
 you
 enjoy
 the
 journey
 or


and
 I
 think
 you
 made
 a
 very
 wise


decision
 if
 you
 reset
 your
 expectations


and
 say,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 going
 to
 have


this
 nice
 house
 or
 this
 nice
 watch,
 but


I
 don't
 expect
 it
 to
 make
 me
 happy,
 but


it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 nice
 thing
 to
 have
 in


in
 my
 life.


>> And
 somebody
 once
 said
 much
 wiser
 than


me,
 you
 know,
 money
 doesn't
 change
 who


you
 are.
 It
 it
 can
 magnify
 who
 you
 are.


So
 if
 you're
 an
 unhappy
 person
 and


you're
 have
 lots
 of
 money,
 you
 will


probably
 still
 be
 an
 unhappy
 person.


>> Mhm.


>> Uh
 if
 you're
 a
 happy
 person,
 I
 mean,
 one


of
 the
 happy,
 in
 fact,
 the
 single


happiest
 guy
 I
 know.
 His
 life
 was
 the


biggest
 financial
 disaster
 of
 anybody
 I


personally
 know.
 And
 this
 guy's
 he's
 the


literally
 the
 happiest
 human
 being
 I've


ever
 met.


>> Cuz
 he
 was
 happy
 before.


>> Because
 he
 was
 happy
 before.
 And
 there's


other
 things
 besides
 money
 that
 makes


you
 happy.
 Money.
 And
 the
 reason
 that
 I


I
 it
 was
 so
 important
 to
 me
 to
 teach
 my


daughter
 this,
 money
 gives
 you
 options,


right?
 Money
 allows
 you
 a
 lot
 wider


range
 of
 choices
 in
 life,


but
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 make
 you


happy,
 right?
 If
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 pursue


an
 option


that
 otherwise
 you
 couldn't
 pursue
 and


that
 option
 makes
 you
 happy,
 that's
 a


different
 thing.
 I
 think
 if
 I
 was


listening
 to
 this
 and
 I
 was
 broke,
 like


I
 used
 to
 be
 very
 broke,
 I
 would
 still


pursue
 wealth
 at
 all
 costs
 because
 I


know
 I
 heard
 this
 phrase
 the
 other
 day


which
 was
 it
 is
 easier
 to
 get
 rich
 than


it
 is
 to
 give
 up
 the
 idea
 that
 getting


rich
 will
 make
 you
 happy.
 And
 I


[laughter]
 I
 thought
 to
 myself,


>> and
 if
 you
 haven't
 got
 rich,
 you
 would


always
 think


>> 100%.
 You'd
 always
 wonder
 if
 that
 was


And
 you
 know what?
 So
 much
 of
 the


unhappiness
 or
 anxiety
 that
 I
 had
 when
 I


was,
 you
 know,
 in
 my
 early
 early
 innings


of
 my
 life,
 my
 career
 came
 from
 looking


down
 and
 seeing
 the
 baiff
 letters
 or


came
 from
 the
 credit
 card
 debt
 or
 how
 am


I
 going
 to
 eat
 today
 or,
 you
 know,
 can't


go
 out
 and
 see
 my
 friends.
 So
 much
 of
 my


mind
 was
 occupied
 by
 my
 inability
 to


have
 freedom,


>> right?
 my
 lack
 of
 freedom,
 my
 need
 to


get
 up
 at
 8:00
 and
 walk
 for
 an
 hour
 and


a
 half
 to
 a
 call
 center
 was,
 you
 know,


so
 what
 I
 managed
 to
 remove
 was
 that
 I


wouldn't
 say
 I
 I
 added
 happiness,
 but
 I


removed
 the
 unhappiness.


>> Well,
 and
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 key
 point.


You
 know,
 money
 doesn't
 necessarily
 make


you
 happy,
 but
 the
 lack
 of
 money.


>> Oh,
 yeah.


>> Can
 be
 terrible
 challenge,
 especially
 in


this
 modern
 culture
 we've
 created.


>> Okay.
 So,
 if
 you
 have
 kids
 listening


right
 now,
 please
 cover
 their
 ears
 cuz


I'm
 going
 to
 say
 a
 swear
 word.
 Parents


always
 message
 me
 and
 ask
 me
 to
 stop


swearing.
 going
 to
 say
 well
 um
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 obsessed
 with
 this
 idea
 of


[ __ ]
 you
 money


>> right


>> let
 me
 just
 give
 you
 a
 definition
 so
 fu


money
 refers
 to
 a
 financial
 situation


where
 a
 person
 has
 enough
 money
 to
 live


comfortably
 without
 needing
 to
 work
 and


it
 gives
 you
 the
 freedom
 to
 say
 f
 you
 to


anyone
 or
 anything
 you
 don't
 want
 to


tolerate
 such
 as
 a
 job
 a
 boss
 or
 a


situation
 that
 doesn't
 align
 with
 your


values
 what
 does
 that
 mean
 to
 you


>> yeah
 so
 for
 me
 so
 that's
 a
 good


definition
 but
 I
 would
 substitute
 in


that
 definition
 financial
 independence


FU
 money
 for
 me
 is
 the
 money
 you


accumulate
 on
 the
 way,
 right?
 So,
 for


instance,
 if
 you're
 a
 bodybuilder,


you
 know,
 financial
 independence
 is
 when


you're
 on
 the
 stage
 and
 you're
 winning,


you're
 at
 the
 elite
 level.
 But
 along
 the


way,
 from
 the
 moment
 you
 start
 working


out,
 you
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 stronger,
 a


little
 bit
 stronger,
 a
 little
 bit


stronger,
 right?
 Same
 thing
 financially.


The
 moment
 you
 start
 setting
 aside
 money


and
 investing
 it,
 you
 become
 a
 little


bit
 financially
 stronger.
 And
 that


builds
 over
 time.
 That
 in
 my
 mind
 is
 the


FU
 money
 because
 long
 before
 you're


financially
 independent,
 that
 money


gives
 you
 enormous
 freedom.
 You
 might


not
 be
 able
 to
 never
 work
 again,
 but
 if


you
 need
 to,
 you
 could
 leave
 a
 toxic
 job


knowing
 you
 could
 survive
 for
 months
 or


even
 years
 while
 you
 looked
 for
 the


better
 job
 because
 you
 have
 that
 FU


money.
 So
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 say
 f
 you
 in


that
 case
 to
 an
 employer.


>> And
 if
 your
 daughter
 daughter
 turned


around,
 what's
 her
 name?


>> Jessica.


>> Jessica.
 If
 Jessica
 turns
 around
 to
 you


and
 says,
 "Dad,
 what
 are
 what
 is


something
 I
 should
 not
 do
 with
 my
 money


if
 I


um
 want
 to
 be
 wealthy?


What
 is
 what
 are
 like
 the
 big
 what
 is


the
 first
 thing
 that
 comes
 to
 mind
 to
 as


a
 no
 no
 if
 I
 want
 to
 be
 financially


wealthy?"


The
 mo
 more
 common
 advice
 that
 I
 think


you
 should
 avoid
 if
 your
 goal
 is
 to


become
 financially
 independent
 at
 a


young
 age.
 You
 probably
 don't
 want
 to
 go


buy
 a
 house.


That's
 a
 very
 controversial
 thing
 to


say.
 The
 reason
 you
 want
 buy
 a
 house
 is


because
 houses
 dramatically
 inflate
 by


and
 large
 your
 cost
 of
 living.
 You
 know,


you're
 you're
 putting
 your
 capital
 into


that
 house
 and
 now
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


earning
 thing.
 can
 be
 sitting
 idally


along
 with
 owning
 a
 house.
 You
 have
 the


expenses
 of
 maintaining
 it,
 paying
 the


taxes
 on
 it,
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 If
 you
 stay


in
 a
 apartment
 that
 is
 just
 enough
 to


meet
 your
 needs,
 which
 by
 the
 way
 is


what
 my
 daughter
 has
 done
 and
 continues


to
 do,
 your
 costs
 will
 be
 lower.


>> Explain
 that
 to
 me.
 Explain
 why
 my
 cost


of
 living
 goes
 up
 if
 I
 buy
 a
 house.


>> Sure.
 So
 people,
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to,
 but


people
 people
 typically
 buy
 the
 most


house
 they
 can
 possibly
 afford.
 The


industry
 drives
 them
 that
 way.
 If
 you
 go


to
 a
 real
 estate
 agent,
 you
 say,
 "I


think
 I'm
 I
 want
 to
 buy
 a
 house."
 Right?


First
 question
 they're
 going to
 ask
 you


is,
 "How
 much
 do
 you
 make?
 How
 much
 do


you
 want
 to
 spend?"
 You
 know,
 and
 and


then
 you
 go
 to
 the
 bank
 and
 you
 say,


"Okay,
 I
 want
 to
 buy
 a
 house.
 How
 much


will
 you
 lend
 me?"
 And
 they'll
 say,


"Well,
 how
 much
 you
 make?"
 And
 then


they'll
 come
 back
 with
 the
 large
 number


of
 how
 much
 they're
 willing
 to
 lend
 you.


If
 you
 follow
 those
 guidelines,
 you're


going
 to
 wind
 up
 with
 a
 house
 that's


going
 to
 be
 a
 burden.
 You
 are
 not
 buying


it
 from
 a
 position
 of
 strength.
 You
 are


stretching
 to
 buy
 it.
 You
 are
 borrowing


the
 most
 money
 a
 bank's
 willing
 to
 give


you.
 You
 probably
 don't
 want
 to
 do
 that.


I
 mean,
 you
 can,
 that's
 the
 bank
 wants


you
 to
 do
 that
 cuz
 [clears throat]


that's
 how
 they
 make
 the
 most
 money,
 but


that's
 not
 the
 best
 thing
 for
 you
 to
 do.


But
 that's
 what
 you
 get
 drawn
 into.
 And


then
 when
 you
 buy
 that
 house,
 I
 don't


know
 that
 I've
 ever
 known
 anybody,


including
 me,
 by
 the
 way,
 and
 I've
 owned


houses
 most
 of
 my
 adult
 life,
 who's


owned
 a
 house
 without
 doing
 renovations


on
 it.
 So,
 you've
 got
 those
 costs.


You're
 going
 to
 furnish
 that
 house
 cuz


you're
 probably
 buying
 more
 square


footage
 than
 you
 were
 renting
 before.


You're
 going
 to
 need
 new
 furniture,
 or


maybe
 you
 just
 want
 better
 furniture
 for


your
 new
 house,
 maybe
 new
 appliances,


landscaping,
 taxes,
 maintenance.
 I
 mean,


the
 the
 list
 is
 endless.
 And
 people
 say,


"Well,
 you
 know,
 I
 can
 buy
 this
 house,


and
 my
 mortgage
 is
 the
 same
 as
 my
 rent."


Well,
 yeah,
 but
 your
 mortgage
 is
 just


the
 starting
 point.
 You've
 got
 all
 these


other
 expenses
 with
 the
 house.
 And
 the


other
 thing
 is
 they
 are
 variable


expenses.


>> Variable
 expenses.


>> Yeah.
 With
 your
 rent,
 you
 know,
 if
 if


you're
 renting
 an
 apartment,
 you're


paying
 $2,500
 a
 month
 for
 your


apartment,
 right?
 you
 know
 exactly
 what


your
 housing
 costs
 are
 for
 the
 term
 of


your
 lease,
 right?
 $500
 a
 month.
 If
 you


own
 a
 house,
 maybe
 your
 mortgage
 is


$2,500
 a
 month.
 And
 then
 you
 need
 a
 new


roof.
 That's
 20
 grand.
 Or
 you
 need
 a
 new


septic
 system,
 which
 by
 the
 way,
 I'm


looking
 at
 having
 to
 put
 it
 in
 my


cottage,
 you
 know.
 Well,
 that's
 another


25
 grand,
 right?
 And
 so,
 and
 you
 don't


necessarily
 know
 when
 those
 things
 are


going
 to
 come
 at
 you.


>> It
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 trap,
 isn't
 it?
 It's
 a


trap
 that
 um
 I
 didn't
 realize
 this
 until


I
 bought
 a
 house
 and
 most
 people
 don't


>> like
 I
 even
 sit
 here
 on
 this
 podcast


doing
 this
 for
 a
 living
 and
 then
 I
 I


made
 this
 stupid
 mistake
 of
 buying
 a


house
 and
 I
 do
 think
 it
 was
 a
 stupid


mistake
 because
 I
 we'll
 talk
 about


opportunity
 cost
 in
 a
 second
 but
 I
 was


in
 hindsight
 it
 was
 like
 a
 terrible


decision.
 I
 spent
 all
 this
 money
 on
 this


house.
 It
 was
 a
 house
 abroad.
 It
 was


also
 like
 a
 holiday
 home
 I
 guess


>> and
 every
 time
 I
 come
 all
 I
 see
 is


things
 that
 I
 need
 to
 change.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 looking
 at
 the
 United
 States


for
 instance,
 if
 20
 years
 ago,
 30
 years


ago,
 you'd
 bought
 a
 house
 in
 San


Francisco,


well,
 you've
 done
 very,
 very
 well


financially.
 If
 you
 bought
 a
 house
 in


Detroit,


not
 so
 much.
 So
 then
 the
 question


becomes,
 and
 people
 will
 say,
 well,


obviously
 you
 don't
 buy
 a
 house
 in


Detroit,
 you
 buy
 a
 house
 in
 San


Francisco.
 Well,
 I'm
 not
 an
 expert
 in


real
 estate,
 but
 I
 am
 reading
 more
 and


more
 commonly
 that
 San
 Francisco
 is
 has


a
 lot
 of
 very
 challenging
 problems
 at


the
 moment.
 Detroit,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,


where
 I
 was
 just
 visiting
 a
 couple
 of


years
 ago,
 is
 enjoying
 a
 renaissance.


Detroit's
 coming
 back.
 So,
 who's
 to
 say


in
 20,
 30
 years,
 people
 won't
 be
 saying,


"If
 you
 bought
 in
 Detroit
 back
 in
 2025,


you
 were
 golden."
 And
 if
 you
 bought
 San


Francisco,
 yeah,
 not
 so
 much.
 Sometimes


real
 estate,
 buying
 a
 house
 can
 work
 out


in
 a
 spectacular
 fashion.
 And
 that's
 the


stories
 people
 tend
 to
 hear,
 but
 not


always.


>> And
 that's
 what
 I
 tend
 to
 see
 in
 the


comment
 section
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 this


issue
 of
 buying
 a
 house.
 I
 was
 just


looking
 at
 the
 comment
 section
 actually.


And
 on
 a
 previous
 conversation
 where
 we


talked
 about
 whether
 you
 should
 buy
 a


house,
 someone
 said,
 "I
 bought
 a
 house


and
 it's
 the
 best
 thing
 I
 ever
 did."


Right?
 It's
 launched
 my
 mindset
 in
 new


directions.
 Remember
 that
 having
 your


own
 space
 has
 profound
 psychological


impacts
 and
 can
 be
 life-changing
 for


some
 of
 that
 don't
 live
 in
 a
 healthy


environment.
 The
 psychological
 impact
 of


buying
 a
 house.


>> What
 that
 commenter
 just
 said
 is
 is
 can


be
 and
 for
 him
 obviously
 it's
 absolutely


true.


I
 am
 not
 anti-
 house.
 As
 I
 mentioned
 a


moment
 ago,
 I've
 owned
 houses
 most
 of
 my


adult
 life,
 but
 I've
 never
 bought
 them


because
 I
 thought
 they
 were
 an


investment.
 I
 bought
 them
 because
 I


thought
 they
 would
 enhance
 my
 life
 in
 a


way
 I
 wanted
 it
 enhanced.
 They
 would


make
 my
 life
 better.
 They
 are
 in
 my
 view


an
 expensive
 indulgence.
 I
 have
 nothing


against
 expensive
 indulgences.
 That's


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 we
 accumulate
 money,


right?
 I
 like
 some
 expensive
 and
 some
 I


don't
 care
 about,
 some
 I
 like.
 Um,
 but


that's
 what
 they
 are.
 And
 if
 you
 can


easily
 afford
 it,
 then
 by
 all
 means
 buy


the
 house.
 Looking
 at
 some
 stats
 here,


it
 says
 home
 buying
 was
 once
 a
 solid


investment
 due
 to
 rising
 property
 values


and
 lower
 mortgage
 rates.
 However,
 for


younger
 generations,
 this
 is
 no
 longer


the
 case
 because
 of
 skyrocketing
 home


prices.
 Since
 1980,
 US
 home
 prices
 have


increased
 by
 over
 300%,
 outpacing


inflation
 and
 wage
 growth.
 In
 2023,


mortgage
 rates
 surged
 past
 7%,
 making


monthly
 payments
 significantly
 higher


than
 before.
 And
 medium
 wages
 have
 only


risen
 by
 about
 15%
 since
 year
 the
 year


2000.
 While
 home
 prices
 have
 more
 than


doubled,
 making
 home
 ownership
 less


affordable.
 And
 lastly,
 the
 cost
 of


renting
 is
 often
 cheaper
 than
 buying,


especially
 in
 cities
 where
 prices
 have


outpaced
 wage
 growth,
 leading
 many


younger
 people
 to
 choose
 renting
 for


flexibility.
 This
 point
 of
 flexibility


as
 well
 is
 one
 we
 don't
 talk
 about.


>> Right.


>> Which
 is
 the
 ability
 to
 go
 do
 something


else
 in
 another
 country.


>> Exactly.


>> And
 my
 brother
 said
 this
 to
 me
 when
 I


was
 20.
 My
 brother's
 very
 smart.
 He's
 a


year
 older
 than
 me,
 a
 financial
 genius,


and
 has
 a
 much
 different
 brain
 to
 mine.


And
 I
 remember
 when
 I
 was
 20,
 maybe
 24


and
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 do
 I
 buy
 a
 house


and
 he
 both
 told
 me
 it
 was
 the
 worst


investment
 I
 could
 ever
 make.
 But
 he


also
 told
 me
 to
 think
 about
 flexibility


and
 my
 ability
 to
 get
 up
 and
 move.


>> Yes.


>> And
 I
 was
 what
 do
 you
 mean?
 And
 he
 said,


"Well,
 listen,
 you're
 in
 a
 certain
 era


of
 your
 career
 where


you
 might
 be
 called
 by
 someone
 in
 San


Francisco
 who
 offers
 you
 a
 great


opportunity
 and
 you
 might
 want
 to
 go


next
 week."
 And
 actually
 when
 I
 look
 at


how
 my
 career
 transpired,
 that's
 exactly


what
 happened.
 I
 was
 in
 Plymouth
 and


then
 I
 went
 to
 Manchester
 for
 business.


Then
 I
 went
 to
 London
 for
 business.
 Then


I
 went
 around
 the
 world
 to
 San
 Francisco


to
 New
 York
 for
 business.
 And
 I'm
 I'm


moving
 with
 the
 opportunity.


And
 if
 I
 was
 anchored
 somewhere
 because


a
 mortgage
 does


>> dragging
 that
 along.


>> Yeah.
 And
 a
 mortgage
 does
 like


psychologically
 anchor
 you.
 This
 is
 what


people
 don't
 talk
 about.
 It
 creates
 a


huge
 amount
 of
 guilt
 if
 you
 then
 want
 to


get
 up
 and
 go
 because
 you
 in
 your
 head


you're
 going,
 "Well,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


paying
 double."


>> Well,
 so
 I
 agree
 with
 everything
 you


said.
 I
 agree
 I
 I
 agree
 with
 your


brother.
 Flexibility,
 especially
 when


you're
 young
 and
 your
 career
 is
 in
 a


dynamic
 [snorts]
 phase,
 it
 is
 not
 to
 be


underrated.
 For
 my
 daughter,
 I
 mean,
 she


loves
 living
 in
 Savannah.
 They've
 been


there
 for
 3
 years,
 but
 she
 has
 an


adventuresome
 soul.
 And
 you
 know,
 she


said,
 "I
 don't
 know.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 at


some
 point
 I'll
 want
 to
 go
 live
 in


Europe
 or
 somewhere
 else."
 Well,
 if
 you


have
 a
 house,
 that
 complicates
 that


decision.
 And
 even
 if
 you
 are
 fortunate


enough
 to
 buy
 in
 a
 market
 where
 your


values
 are
 rising,
 the
 cost
 associated


with
 buying
 and
 selling
 of
 houses
 are


enormous.
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 real
 estate


commission
 and
 the
 taxes
 and
 what
 have


you.
 So,
 getting
 in
 and
 out
 of
 a
 house


is
 an
 expensive
 proposition.
 Getting
 in


and
 out
 of
 apartment
 doesn't
 cost


anything.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 your
 security


deposit
 rate,
 but
 that's
 it.
 That's


that's
 very
 clean
 and
 simple,
 but
 if


you're
 if
 you
 were
 to
 buy
 a
 house
 in


Savannah
 and
 then
 just
 say,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 I
 want
 to
 go
 live
 in
 in
 Portugal,


well,
 now
 you
 got
 to
 sell
 that
 house.
 Or


maybe
 you
 have
 to
 rent
 it.
 Now
 you're
 a


landlord.
 You're
 an
 accidental
 r


landlord,
 which
 was
 subject
 to
 my
 second


book.
 You
 know,
 that's
 not
 optimal.
 I


mean,
 if
 you
 set
 out
 to
 be
 a
 landlord,


great.
 But
 if
 you
 become
 an
 accidental


landlord
 because
 you
 can't
 sell
 your


house
 that
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 live
 in


anymore,
 that's
 not
 so
 great.
 So


flexibility
 is
 is
 enormously
 important.


If
 I
 if
 I
 were
 to
 ask
 you,
 what
 is
 the


simple
 path
 to
 wealth?
 and
 you
 had
 to


respond
 in
 a
 sentence,
 what
 would
 that


sentence
 be?


>> Avoid
 debt.
 Live
 on
 less
 than
 you
 earn.


Invest
 a
 surplus.


>> So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 debt
 then.


>> Okay.


>> Why
 did
 you
 say
 avoid
 debt?


>> You
 can
 never
 be
 financially
 independent


if
 you're
 carrying
 around
 debt.


It's
 a
 ball
 and
 chain
 that
 you
 drag
 drag


along,
 especially
 consumer
 debt.
 Now,
 to


be
 clear,
 if
 you're
 in
 business
 and
 your


business
 is
 is
 carrying
 debt
 as
 a
 as
 a


function
 of
 of
 running
 the
 operation
 for


one
 reason
 or
 another,
 that's
 kind
 of
 a


different
 thing.
 But
 in
 terms
 of


personal
 debt,
 uh
 if
 you're
 running
 up


credit
 card
 debt,
 if
 you're
 leasing


expensive
 cars
 or
 or
 borrowing
 money
 to


buy
 expensive
 cars
 or
 what
 have
 you,


possibly
 a
 mortgage
 [snorts]
 is
 in
 a


slightly
 different
 category,
 but
 it
 has


all
 the
 disadvantages
 we
 just
 talked


about.
 Yeah,
 debt's
 a
 ball
 and
 chain.


It's
 it's
 like
 asking
 a
 swimmer
 to


compete
 and
 and
 strapping
 a
 weight


around
 their
 waist.
 Uh
 it
 just
 is
 it


possible?
 Well,
 sure.
 I
 guess
 it
 is,
 but


it's
 a
 whole
 lot
 a
 whole
 lot
 more


difficult.
 So,
 job
 one
 if
 you
 have
 debt


is
 to
 blow
 it
 out.


>> And
 I
 mean,
 blowing
 it
 out
 is
 a
 dream


for
 many,
 but
 it's
 uh
 easier
 said
 than


done.
 I
 guess


>> it
 simply
 means
 that
 you
 have
 to


organize
 your
 life
 in
 such
 a
 fashion


that
 you
 can
 divert
 some
 money
 to
 either


buying
 your
 freedom
 investments
 or
 if


you
 have
 debt
 paying
 off
 that
 debt.
 You


just
 you
 have
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 people


say,
 "Well,
 I
 can't
 do
 that.
 You
 know,
 I


I
 need
 to
 have
 this.
 I
 the
 you
 know,
 I


need
 to
 have
 the
 these
 the
 two
 least


luxury
 cars
 and
 we
 need
 to
 live
 in
 this


neighborhood
 and
 we
 need
 to
 send
 the


kids
 to
 these
 schools.
 We
 need
 to
 and
 I


call
 that
 the
 tyranny
 of
 the
 must-haves.


The
 more
 musthaves
 you
 have
 in
 your


life,
 the
 less
 likely
 you
 are
 to
 become


financially
 independent."
 Now,
 that's


your
 choice.
 That's
 an
 individual's


choice.
 It
 may
 very
 well
 be
 that
 those


things
 are
 more
 important
 to
 you
 than


buying
 your
 freedom.
 And
 it's
 your


money.
 It's
 not
 for
 me
 to
 tell
 anybody


how
 they
 should
 spend
 their
 money
 or


what's
 important
 to
 me
 or
 what's


important
 to
 them.
 For
 me,
 there
 was


nothing
 I
 could
 spend
 my
 money
 on
 that


was
 more
 important
 than
 my
 freedom.


Which
 is
 why
 from
 the
 beginning,
 I


diverted
 half
 of
 my
 income
 to
 buying


that
 thing.
 Was
 never
 deprivation.


Right?
 Most
 people
 say,
 "Oh,
 that's
 this


is
 a
 path
 of
 deprivation.
 I
 can't
 spend


my
 money."
 Well,
 not
 for
 me.
 I,
 you


know,
 I
 spent
 every
 dime
 that
 ever
 came


my
 way.
 It's
 just
 that
 I
 spent
 half
 of


those
 dimes
 on
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 wanted


to
 own
 the
 most,
 which
 was
 my
 freedom.


And
 you
 own
 that
 by
 owning
 assets.
 So,
 I


wasn't
 I
 wasn't
 depriving
 myself
 any


more
 than
 if
 somebody
 said,
 you
 know,


I'm
 looking
 at
 buying
 a
 a
 Mercedes
 or
 a


Volkswagen,
 right?
 If
 I'm
 buy
 the


Mercedes,
 I'm
 in
 this
 big
 fancy
 car
 and


people
 will
 be
 impressed.
 If
 I
 buy
 the


Volkswagen,
 yeah,
 I'm
 in
 this
 more


modest
 car,
 but
 then
 I've
 got
 a
 whole


bunch
 of
 money
 left
 over
 that
 I
 can


spend
 on
 a
 wardrobe
 or
 going
 out
 to


dinner
 or
 a
 more
 expensive
 apartment.


It's
 just
 a
 matter
 of
 choosing
 where
 you


spend
 your
 money
 on.
 Right?
 So,
 one
 of


the
 choices
 and
 I
 I
 do
 I
 am
 under
 no


illusion
 that
 most
 people
 who
 read
 my


book
 will
 actually
 follow
 the
 simple


path
 cuz
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 just
 way
 too


much
 cultural
 influence
 to
 spend
 your


money
 elsewhere.
 But
 at
 least
 the
 people


who
 read
 the
 book
 and
 listen
 to
 this


interview
 will
 be
 aware
 that
 there
 is


something
 else
 they
 could
 buy
 with
 their


money.
 and
 that's
 their
 personal
 freedom


and
 you
 do
 that
 by
 assets
 and
 there
 was


nothing
 more
 important
 to
 me
 nothing
 I


wanted
 more
 so
 it
 was
 not
 deprivation
 at


all


>> I
 amum
 I
 reflect
 back
 on


where
 I
 used
 to
 be
 in
 my
 life
 and
 if
 I'd


heard
 this
 conversation
 then
 I
 really


really
 struggled
 with
 um
 saving
 money


because
 saving
 spending
 money
 was
 so


closely
 linked
 to
 my
 sense
 of
 self
 and


my
 self-esteem


>> a
 lot
 of
 people
 feel
 that
 way
 I've


shared
 this
 story
 before,
 but
 when
 I
 I


was
 working
 in
 those
 call
 centers
 at
 uh


which
 one,
 Swinton
 Swinton's
 car


insurance
 where
 I
 used
 to
 work,
 I
 would


get
 my
 paycheck
 and
 it
 might
 be
 I
 don't


know,
 £1,500
 or
 £2,000,
 whatever.
 And


like
 on
 my
 way
 home
 on
 payday,
 I'd
 go


buy
 a
 60-in
 TV
 [clears throat]


and
 [laughter]
 I'd
 put
 it
 in
 the
 house


and
 then
 I'd
 try
 and
 see
 if
 I
 had
 enough


money
 to
 buy
 a
 PlayStation


>> and
 then
 about
 a
 week
 later
 when
 I


realized
 that
 I
 was
 broke,
 I
 would
 sell


both.
 And
 I
 look
 at
 that
 behavior
 as


such
 absolute
 like


>> it's
 objectively
 like
 crazy
 behavior


like
 repeated
 videos


but
 it
 shows
 the
 extent
 to
 which
 I
 got
 a


dopamine
 hit
 from
 having
 a
 nice
 thing


and
 I
 was
 trapped
 in
 that
 cycle
 of
 like


>> buy
 the
 nice
 thing
 dopamine
 hit
 feel


validated
 feel
 like
 I'm
 a
 successful


person
 and
 then
 have
 to
 sell
 it
 a
 week


later.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 really
 have
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


empathy
 for
 people
 that
 are
 stuck
 in


this
 spending
 for
 self-esteem
 cycle.
 And


they
 hear
 these,
 you
 know,
 they
 hear


people
 like
 me
 and
 you
 talk
 about
 these


things
 now


and
 it
 feels
 easier
 said
 than
 done.


>> That
 to
 me
 seems
 kind
 of
 insane.
 And
 and


you
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


somebody
 pointed
 out
 one
 time
 is
 if


you're
 driving
 around
 in
 a
 Ferrari,
 you


know,
 maybe
 you're
 thinking
 to
 yourself,


if
 you're
 bought
 the
 Ferrari
 because
 you


want
 to
 impress
 people,
 everybody's


looking
 at
 me
 and
 they're
 thinking,


"Wow,
 what
 a
 cool
 guy
 that
 is
 driving


driving
 that
 Ferrari."
 No,
 that's
 not


what
 they're
 thinking.


They're
 looking
 at
 you
 in
 that
 Ferrari.


And
 what
 they're
 thinking
 is,
 "Wow,
 I


would
 look
 cool
 if
 I
 was
 driving
 that


Ferrari."
 They're
 not
 thinking
 about
 you


at
 all.
 it
 doesn't
 it
 you're
 making
 no


impact
 on
 on
 what
 their
 opinion
 of
 you


is.


>> So
 on
 this
 point
 of
 debt,
 I
 did
 have


some
 people
 contact
 me
 that
 were


childhood
 friends
 of
 mine
 recently
 and


asked
 um
 asked
 me
 for
 advice
 on
 getting


out
 of
 debt.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 one
 particular
 friend
 said
 that
 he


had
 $40,000


worth
 of
 debt
 and
 asked
 me
 for
 advice
 on


it.
 And
 I
 I
 really
 [clears throat]


I'm
 not
 an
 expert
 in
 this
 so
 I
 kind
 of


hesitated
 to
 give
 any
 advice.


>> But
 the
 advice
 I'm
 hearing
 from
 you
 is


essentially
 you
 have
 to
 make
 a


concession.
 You
 have
 to
 pull
 back
 your


spending
 and
 get
 things
 back
 under


control.
 You
 have
 to
 I
 know
 sell
 your


house.


>> So,
 here's
 some
 good
 news.
 So,
 you're


carrying
 to
 your
 friend.
 He's
 carrying


$40,000
 in
 debt,
 right?
 My
 advice
 would


be,
 and
 this
 is
 a
 little
 different
 than


the
 more
 common
 advice
 out
 there,
 but
 I


would
 look
 at
 all
 my
 debts
 and
 I
 would


pick
 the
 one
 that
 was
 charging
 me
 the


highest
 interest
 rate
 and
 I
 would
 I'd


pay
 the
 minimums
 on
 all
 the
 others
 and
 I


would
 focus
 on
 paying
 that
 one
 down
 as


fast
 as
 I
 could
 because
 that's
 the


biggest
 return
 on
 my
 investment.
 And


when
 that
 one
 was
 gone,
 I'd
 go
 to
 the


second
 until
 I
 worked
 my
 way
 through.


It's
 going
 to
 be
 hard.
 And
 the
 more


quickly
 you
 do
 it,
 the
 harder
 it's
 going


to
 be
 cuz
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 make


more
 dramatic
 adjustments
 to
 your
 life.


That's
 the
 bad
 news.
 Here's
 the
 good


news
 is
 once
 you
 are
 out
 of
 debt,
 if
 you


do
 this,
 you've
 developed
 a
 wonderful


discipline
 of
 living
 on
 less
 than
 you


earn
 and
 diverting
 the
 excess
 to


something
 else
 that
 you
 want
 more.
 In


this
 case,
 to
 something
 else
 you
 want


more
 is
 being
 out
 of
 debt.


If
 you
 continue
 with
 that
 discipline,


you
 now
 have
 the
 cash
 flow
 to
 begin


building
 those
 assets
 and
 becoming


wealthy.
 You've
 already
 developed
 that


lifestyle
 and
 that
 discipline.
 So
 that's


the
 one
 ray
 of
 sunshine,
 if
 you
 will,
 in


in
 the
 process
 of
 getting
 out
 of
 debt.


>> Okay.
 Play
 devil's
 advocate
 with
 me
 then


on
 this
 one.


>> Sure.


>> So
 when
 I
 was
 18,
 19
 years
 old,
 my


strategy
 I
 was
 well
 aware
 that
 I'd


[ __ ]
 up
 my
 financial
 situation.
 Like
 I


was
 it
 was
 plainly
 clear
 that
 I'd


figured
 out
 what
 a
 credit
 score
 was
 and


I
 realized
 that
 I
 destroyed
 mine.
 I
 also


had
 these
 letters
 that
 [laughter]


these
 fail
 letters
 and
 and
 I
 had
 I
 had


mounting
 issues.
 I
 was
 avoiding


finances,
 bills,
 envelopes,
 you
 name
 it.


I
 just
 thought
 if
 I
 don't
 look
 at
 it,
 it


doesn't
 exist,


>> which
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 do
 because


when
 I
 was
 writing
 a
 previous
 book
 that


I
 wrote,
 I
 looked
 into
 some
 of
 the
 stats


about
 humans
 ability
 to
 avoid.
 Mhm.


>> Whether
 it's
 health
 situations,
 if
 a


friend
 of
 yours
 gets
 a
 bad
 diagnosis,
 I


was
 reading
 a
 study
 that
 said
 some


people
 are
 more
 likely
 to
 not
 go
 get


checked


>> even
 if
 their
 friends
 had
 a
 because
 they


just
 want
 to
 avoid
 it.


>> Um,
 and
 then
 with
 national
 finances,
 I


was
 reading
 a
 study
 that
 said
 we're


incurring
 billions
 and
 billions
 and


billions
 and
 billions
 of
 debt
 as
 a


society
 just
 because
 we
 don't
 look
 at


our
 bank
 balance.
 We
 don't
 open


envelopes.
 So,
 I
 know
 I'm
 not
 the
 only


one.


>> No,
 not
 at
 all.


>> My
 strategy
 was
 my
 This
 is
 such
 a
 dumb.


>> I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 want
 to
 hear
 this.


Well,
 go
 ahead.


>> Honestly,
 and
 this
 sounds
 like
 crazy


talk,
 but
 it's
 just
 the
 truth.
 In
 my


head,
 my
 strategy
 was


>> I'm
 going
 to
 get
 so
 rich
 that
 I
 outpace


this
 debt


>> and
 then
 I'll
 deal
 with
 it
 later.


>> My
 strategy
 was
 if
 I
 can
 just
 get
 really


rich,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 inverse
 of


what
 you're
 advising,


>> then
 this
 debt
 won't
 be
 a
 problem.


>> At
 18
 or
 19
 years
 old,
 you
 don't
 know


the
 world.
 You
 are
 guessing,


>> right?


>> And
 I
 was
 guessing
 that
 I
 could
 earn
 my


way
 out
 of
 it.
 The
 probability
 says
 I


was
 wrong.


>> The
 probability
 says
 that
 I
 was
 like


delusional
 or
 some
 or
 just
 like
 I


watched
 too
 many
 rap
 videos
 or


something,


>> right?


>> Um,
 so
 objectively
 that
 is
 a
 reckless


choice.
 Even
 if
 even
 if
 it's
 true
 and
 it


ends
 up
 being
 true
 for
 you,
 you
 end
 up


being
 what
 it's
 still
 a
 bad
 choice


because
 probability
 is
 stacked
 against


you.


>> Well,
 that's
 true.
 And
 but
 you
 just
 made


a
 critical
 point
 in
 that
 you
 can
 make
 a


bad
 choice
 where
 things
 work
 out
 well


for
 you.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 It's
 a
 bad
 choice.


>> So,
 a
 great
 example
 of
 that
 is
 investing


in
 Bitcoin,
 right?
 I'm
 not
 I'm
 not
 a


proponent
 of
 investing
 in
 Bitcoin.


Certainly,
 for
 those
 people
 who
 bought


Bitcoin
 10,
 15
 years
 ago,
 they've
 done


extraordinarily
 well.


They
 got
 lucky.
 Lots
 of
 speculations


don't
 work
 out
 that
 well.
 So
 if
 you
 are


speculating


then
 you
 it
 might
 work
 out


extraordinarily
 well
 for
 you
 but
 it's


you're
 taking
 some
 pretty
 heavy
 risks
 in


doing
 that
 right
 it's
 same
 thing
 with
 a


lottery
 ticket
 I
 mean
 the
 chances
 of


winning
 the
 lottery
 are
 infantestimally


small
 but
 people
 buy
 lots
 and
 lots
 of


lottery
 tickets
 somebody
 somebody
 does


win
 it
 but
 that's
 probably
 not
 a
 good


way
 to
 spend
 your
 money


>> Bitcoin


>> you're
 not
 a
 fan
 of
 Bitcoin
 No.
 And
 I'm


not
 I'm
 not
 opposed
 to
 Bitcoin
 existing


in
 the
 world.


Uh
 but
 for
 me,
 it's
 a
 speculation
 and


I'm
 not
 a
 speculator.


>> When
 you
 say
 spec,
 give
 me
 some
 color


because
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 some
 people
 who


are
 listening
 now
 that
 are
 either


thinking
 about
 Bitcoin
 or
 have
 invested


in
 Bitcoin.


>> I
 mean,
 if
 you
 want
 to
 speculate
 that


Bitcoin,
 so
 I
 I
 would
 recommend
 against


it.
 So,
 and
 people
 and
 they
 might
 push


back
 and
 say,
 "Well,
 but
 JL,
 you
 know,


you
 were
 recommending
 against
 against
 it


10
 years
 ago,
 which
 I
 was,
 and
 you


you've
 been
 wrong.
 I
 mean,
 absolutely


wrong.
 It's
 been
 great
 10
 years.
 It's


blown.
 It's
 done
 far
 better
 than
 the
 S&P


500."
 Well,
 that's
 true.
 If
 you'd
 had
 a


crystal
 ball,
 if
 I'd
 known
 that
 10
 years


ago,
 yeah,
 well,
 I
 would
 have
 been
 in


Bitcoin,
 right?
 We
 don't
 have
 crystal


balls.
 So
 the
 question
 isn't
 how
 is


Bitcoin
 done
 in
 the
 last
 10
 years.
 It's


how
 how
 is
 it
 going
 to
 do
 in
 the
 next
 10


years.
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 that.


But
 that's
 the
 question.
 Is
 it
 worth


$100,000
 a
 coin
 now?
 Is
 it
 going
 to


continue
 to
 grow
 at
 that
 pace
 that
 you


regret
 that
 you
 missed
 over
 the
 last
 10


years?
 That's
 the
 question
 you
 have
 to


ask
 yourself.


But
 I
 could
 say
 its
 success
 is
 evidence


that
 it's
 serving
 some
 kind
 of
 utility


for
 some
 people
 somewhere.
 Its
 success


means
 that
 there
 is
 demand
 for
 it
 by


very
 nature
 that
 the
 price
 has
 increased


so
 crazily
 over
 the
 last
 15
 years.


>> Yeah.
 That
 and
 that's
 an
 argument
 that


people
 make
 and
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 debate


around
 that,
 right?
 is,
 you
 know,
 what


is
 the
 function
 that
 it
 has
 or
 that
 it's


going
 to
 develop?
 And
 you
 might
 well
 be


right.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 answer


to
 that
 question.
 It's
 not
 currently
 at


least
 a
 currency
 because
 it's
 way
 too


volatile
 to
 serve
 as
 a
 currency
 unless


you're
 doing
 illegal
 things
 that


make
 it
 more
 attractive
 than
 the


volatility
 makes
 it
 unattractive.
 So


that's
 not
 necessarily
 good
 for
 society,


but
 but
 so
 it
 can't
 function
 as
 a


currency.
 So,
 right
 now
 it's
 just
 a


speculation.
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 grow
 into


something
 that's
 more
 functional?
 Well,


you
 know,
 listening
 to
 one
 of
 the
 other


interviews
 you
 you
 you
 did,


that
 woman
 absolutely
 believes
 that


that's
 what's
 happening.
 And
 they
 Kathy


Wood,
 so
 that's
 why
 she's
 in
 Bitcoin.


And
 she
 may
 be
 right,
 but
 she's


speculating.
 And
 again,
 I
 have
 nothing


against
 speculating
 as
 long
 as
 you


understand,
 as
 I'm
 sure
 she
 does,
 that


that's
 what
 you're
 doing.


>> You'd
 prefer
 investing.


>> I
 prefer
 to
 have
 an
 engine
 creating


wealth
 behind
 where
 I
 put
 my
 money.


>> I
 had
 um
 a
 text
 message
 from
 a
 really


good
 friend
 of
 mine
 who
 my
 audience
 will


know
 because
 they've
 been
 on
 the
 show


before
 as
 a
 guest
 and
 uh
 they're
 very


well
 known
 in
 the
 UK.
 Um
 they
 text
 me


and
 said,
 "Please,
 can
 I
 ask
 you
 a


question?
 If
 you
 had
 mortgages
 and
 you


had
 a
 lump
 sum
 of
 money,
 thinking
 about


the
 future
 of
 AI,
 potential
 market


crashes,
 would
 you
 pay
 off
 chunks
 of
 the


mortgage
 or
 would
 you
 invest?
 My
 feeling


is
 that
 stocks
 aren't
 really
 safe.
 Am
 I


being
 paranoid?


>> Well,
 there
 that's
 there
 are
 a
 couple


questions
 embedded
 in
 that.
 So,
 the


first
 question
 is
 would
 I
 pay
 off
 a


mortgage?
 And
 the
 second
 question
 is
 are


stocks
 safe?
 Right?


>> [snorts]


>> So
 the
 mortgage
 one
 first
 to
 me
 is
 is


pretty
 easy.
 It
 kind
 of
 depends
 on
 your


interest
 rate.


>> What
 is
 an
 interest
 rate?


>> So
 an
 interest
 rate
 is
 what
 you
 pay
 to


borrow
 money.
 So
 when
 you
 when
 you
 get
 a


mortgage,
 you're
 borrowing
 money,
 right?


You're
 borrowing
 it
 from
 a
 bank
 or
 a


financial
 institution


and
 they
 they
 want
 to
 be
 paid
 for


letting
 you
 use
 their
 money.
 And
 three


three
 and
 a
 half%
 or
 less,
 that's
 really


cheap
 money.
 I
 would
 hold
 on
 to
 that.
 I


I
 would
 be
 in
 no
 hurry
 to
 pay
 that
 off.


On
 the
 other
 side,
 if
 you
 have
 a


mortgage
 rate
 that's
 say
 6%
 or
 higher,


well,
 when
 you
 pay
 off
 that
 mortgage,


essentially
 you're
 locking
 in
 a


guaranteed
 return
 of
 that
 interest
 rate,


right?
 So,
 if
 you
 pay
 off
 an
 8%


mortgage,
 you've
 locked
 in
 an
 8%
 return


on
 that
 money
 effectively.
 And
 then
 to


finish
 the
 thought
 is
 if
 your
 interest


rates
 between
 those
 those
 two
 like
 three


and
 a
 half
 percent
 to
 five
 and
 a
 half


six
 percent
 then
 I
 would
 say
 it
 would


depend
 whether
 you
 pay
 it
 off
 or
 not
 is


what
 makes
 you
 emotionally
 more


comfortable
 and
 there's
 value
 in
 being


emotionally
 comfortable.
 So
 if
 you
 are


comfortable
 carrying
 the
 debt
 you
 might


say
 well
 I
 think
 I
 can
 do
 better
 in
 the


stock
 market
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 carry
 it.


If
 emotionally
 like
 me
 you
 just
 would


rather
 not
 have
 any
 debt
 at
 all
 than
 you


then
 you
 blow
 it
 off.
 Maybe
 we
 could
 use


the
 coins
 as
 a
 an
 example
 of
 what
 an


interest
 rate
 is.


>> Sure.
 Let's
 say
 I'm
 sitting
 on
 this
 pile


of
 gold
 and
 you
 want
 to
 borrow
 some
 of


my
 gold.
 I'm
 happy
 to
 loan
 you,
 Stephen,


these
 10
 very
 valuable
 old
 pieces.
 But
 I


don't
 like
 you
 well
 enough
 to
 just
 let


you
 borrow
 them
 for
 free.


I
 want
 to
 be
 paid.
 I
 want
 to
 get
 a


reward
 back
 for
 that.
 So,
 when
 you


return
 these
 gold
 pieces
 to
 me
 in
 a


year,
 you're
 going
 to
 return
 11
 gold


pieces
 to
 me.
 You're
 going
 to
 pay
 me


10%.
 Cuz
 an
 extra
 gold
 piece
 is
 10%
 of


these
 10,
 right?
 Make
 sense?


>> Yeah.


>> That's
 what
 interest
 is.


>> So,
 I
 if
 I
 say,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to
 buy


a
 house,


>> right?
 You're
 going
 to
 take
 you're
 going


to
 take
 those
 10
 gold
 pieces.
 Go
 ahead


and
 take
 them."


>> So,
 I'm
 buying
 a
 house
 that
 costs
 10


gold
 pieces,
 right?
 Right.
 So,
 I'm
 going


to
 accept
 your
 10%
 interest
 rate.


>> Okay.
 Am
 I
 paying
 10%
 a
 year
 on
 the
 to


on
 the
 total


>> on
 the
 balance?
 So,
 the
 way
 a
 mortgage


works
 is
 in
 the
 let's
 say
 it's
 a
 30-year


mortgage,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 sp
 giving


me
 a
 certain
 amount
 of
 money
 every


month,
 right?
 That's
 your
 mortgage


payment.
 And
 in
 the
 beginning,
 most
 of


that
 payment
 is
 going
 to
 be
 interest
 to


me.
 And
 a
 very
 tiny
 sliver
 of
 it
 will
 be


paying
 down
 the
 principal
 part
 of
 the
 10


gold
 pieces
 that
 you
 bought
 or
 that
 you


Yeah.
 that
 you
 borrowed.
 A
 very
 tiny


sliver.
 And
 then
 over
 the
 course
 of
 30


years
 that
 ratio
 changes
 as
 you
 pay
 down


the
 debt
 and
 less
 and
 less
 of
 it
 is


interest
 payments
 and
 more
 and
 more
 of


it
 is
 paying
 down
 the
 principal
 until
 at


the
 end
 of
 30
 years
 you've
 paid
 all
 the


principal
 and
 you've
 paid
 me
 a
 fairly


enormous
 amount
 of
 money
 in
 debt
 over


that
 or
 in
 uh
 interest
 over
 that
 30


years.


>> And
 how
 do
 I
 get
 a
 good
 interest
 rate?


How
 do
 I
 get
 a
 very
 very
 low
 interest


rate?
 And
 what
 is
 a
 low
 interest
 rate


>> on
 a
 mortgage?


>> Yeah.
 So
 the
 only
 way
 you
 can
 get
 a
 So


first
 of
 all,
 you're
 going
 to
 pay


basically
 whatever
 the
 current
 interest


rates
 are.


>> Who
 sets
 the
 current
 interest
 rates?


>> So
 the
 Fed
 sets
 an
 overall
 interest


rate.
 You've
 heard
 the
 Fed
 will
 raise
 or


lower
 interest
 rates
 and
 that
 will


influence
 what
 lenders
 like
 bank
 and


mortgage
 companies
 will
 charge.
 It


doesn't
 require
 them
 to
 do
 a
 certain


level,
 but
 it
 will
 influence
 up
 or
 down


how
 much
 they're
 going
 to
 expect
 in


return
 for
 their
 money.
 The
 Fed
 is
 a


government.


>> Yeah,
 the
 Fed
 is
 a
 government
 agent


partially
 because
 the
 the
 Fed
 is


anticipating
 inflation


by
 how
 they
 set
 interest
 rates.
 So
 if


I'm
 lending
 you
 money
 and
 I'm
 worried


about
 inflation,
 if
 [clears throat]
 I


lend
 you
 my
 10
 gold
 pieces
 and
 say
 I


want
 11
 back
 in
 a
 year,
 10%.
 But


inflation
 is
 15%.
 Well,
 I've
 just
 made
 a


very,
 very
 bad
 deal.
 So
 if
 I
 think


inflation
 is
 going
 to
 be
 15%,
 I'm
 going


to
 want
 two
 gold
 pieces
 back
 and
 maybe


or
 you
 know,
 so
 I
 so
 I'm
 I'm
 making
 a


profit
 above
 and
 beyond
 inflation.
 So


going
 back
 to
 your
 question,
 how
 do
 you


get
 a
 good
 mortgage
 rate?
 Well,
 you
 shop


around
 to
 various
 lenders
 at
 the
 time


you
 want
 the
 mortgage
 and
 see,
 you
 know,


who's
 offering
 what?
 And
 there'll
 be


some
 variation
 within
 a
 eighth
 of
 a


percent
 or
 a
 quarter
 of a
 percent
 or


something,
 but
 for
 the
 most
 part,


they're
 all
 going
 to
 be
 very
 tightly
 put


together
 because
 they're
 looking
 at
 the


overall
 projection
 of
 what
 inflation's


going
 to
 be,
 what
 they
 can
 charge,
 what


the
 cost
 of
 money
 is,
 what
 they
 can


charge
 in
 interest,
 and
 then


competitively
 what
 they
 what
 they
 have


to
 do
 to
 get
 your
 business.
 So,
 there's


not
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 variation.


you're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 a
 a


significantly
 better
 interest
 rate
 than


somebody
 else,
 but
 if
 you
 shop
 around,


you
 can
 probably
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 better.


And
 interest
 rates
 have
 been
 fluctuating


quite
 a
 lot
 over
 the
 last
 20
 odd
 years.


In
 the
 early
 2000s,
 interest
 rates
 in


the
 US
 were
 relatively
 high,
 peaking
 at


almost
 7%


in
 2006
 due
 to
 efforts
 to
 curb


inflation.
 And
 then
 after
 the
 financial


crisis,
 um
 they
 dropped
 a
 little
 bit.


Um,
 and
 I
 was
 looking
 here.
 Post
 2008,


central
 banks
 around
 the
 world
 adopted


ultra
 low
 interest
 rates
 to
 revive


economies.
 US
 rates
 were
 slashed
 to
 near


0%
 by
 2008
 and
 remained
 there
 for
 nearly


a
 decade.


>> Right.


>> Damn.
 Um,
 COVID
 19
 pandemic
 uh
 interest


rates
 led
 to
 another
 record
 in
 cuts


globally
 with
 the
 US
 Fed
 lowering


interest
 rates
 to
 0%
 to
 0.25%
 to
 combat


economic
 disruption.
 So,
 does
 this
 mean


I
 should
 really
 be
 waiting
 for
 a
 time


when
 the
 interest
 rates
 are
 really


really
 low
 if
 I
 want
 to
 buy
 a
 house?


>> Well,
 not
 necessarily
 because
 you
 never


know
 when
 that's
 going
 to
 happen.
 I


mean,
 some
 some
 people
 have
 said


predicting
 what
 the
 stock
 market
 is


going
 to
 do
 is
 very
 very
 difficult.


Predicting
 where
 interest
 rates
 are


going
 to
 go
 even
 more
 so.
 So
 I
 think
 if


you're
 going
 to
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 buy
 a


house
 then
 again
 you
 buy
 it
 based
 on


whether
 you
 can
 easily
 afford
 it,


whether
 it
 meets
 your
 needs
 at
 a
 given


time
 and
 you
 deal
 with
 the
 interest


rates
 you
 have
 to
 deal
 with.
 And
 of


course
 they'll
 be
 part
 of
 the
 equation


in
 terms
 of
 how
 much
 you
 can
 afford


because
 the
 interest
 rate
 on
 your


mortgage
 is
 going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 to
 do


with
 how
 much
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 every


month


>> and
 it's
 quite
 high
 at
 the
 moment.


Interest
 rates


>> high
 compared
 to
 what?
 So
 the
 fir
 you


know
 right
 now
 mortgage
 rates
 are
 6%
 7%


somewhere
 in
 there.
 The
 first
 mortgage
 I


took
 out
 was
 18%.


>> 18%.
 That
 would
 have
 been
 in
 1979


because
 in
 the
 1970s
 we
 had
 really
 high


inflation.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 high


inflation,
 you
 have
 high
 interest
 rates,


right?
 So
 to
 me,
 I
 hear
 a
 6%
 mortgage


rate
 and
 it's
 doesn't
 sound
 bad
 to
 me,


but
 for
 people
 who
 grew
 up
 where


mortgage
 rates
 were
 2
 and
 a
 half,
 3%.


Well,
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 huge.
 It


depends
 on
 your
 perspective.


>> And
 the
 other
 half
 of
 the
 lady's


question
 who
 sent
 me
 that
 text
 message


was
 around
 is
 investing
 in
 stocks
 safe


right
 now?
 and
 she
 did
 sort
 of
 preface


it
 by
 saying
 the
 questions
 in
 the


context
 of
 AI
 all
 of
 this
 disruption


that's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 world
 people
 are


going
 to
 lose
 their
 jobs
 etc
 et
 like
 is


it
 safe
 to
 invest
 in
 stocks
 right
 now


>> so
 depends
 on
 your
 time
 horizon
 so


stocks
 are
 are
 the
 single


most
 effective
 strongest
 wealth
 building


tool
 that's
 ever
 been
 created
 but
 they


are
 also
 very
 very
 volatile
 so
 when
 she


says
 are
 stocks
 safe
 to
 invest
 in
 right


now.


What
 I
 hear
 is
 very
 shortterm
 thinking


and
 stocks
 are
 never
 safe
 to
 invest
 in


for
 the
 short
 term
 because
 they're


volatile
 at
 any
 given
 moment.
 They
 can


take
 a
 deep
 plunge
 and
 that's
 a


perfectly
 natural
 part
 of
 the
 process.


People
 get
 all
 create
 especially
 if
 you


watch
 the
 news
 they
 people
 go
 insane
 and


panicked.
 But
 crashes
 and
 pullbacks
 in


the
 stock
 market
 are
 perfectly
 natural


part
 of
 the
 process.
 They
 are
 very
 very


difficult
 if
 not
 impossible
 to
 predict


when
 they're
 going
 to
 happen.
 But
 that's


the
 reason
 you
 never


want
 to
 invest
 in
 stocks
 for
 money
 that


you're
 going
 to
 need
 in
 the
 new
 near


term.
 If
 you
 zoom
 out
 for
 longer
 periods


of
 time,
 which
 is
 I
 re
 is
 what
 I


recommend,
 stocks
 are
 stunningly


reliable.
 I
 mean,
 there
 are
 very
 few


times
 over
 the
 course
 of
 10
 years
 where


stocks
 have
 not
 given
 you
 a
 good
 return.


and
 you
 go
 out
 20
 years
 and
 I
 I
 mean


it's
 very
 rare.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 long-term


stocks
 are
 extremely
 safe
 and
 extremely


powerful
 in
 building
 in
 building
 wealth,


but
 they
 are
 very
 volatile
 along
 the


way.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 be
 willing
 and
 able


to
 endure
 that
 volatility.
 If
 you're


going
 to
 panic
 and
 sell
 when
 the
 market


drops,
 not
 if
 because
 the
 market
 will


drop.
 It's
 a
 perfectly
 natural
 part
 of


the
 process.
 If
 you're
 going
 to
 panic


and
 sell
 when
 that
 happens,
 you
 do
 not


want
 to
 invest
 in
 stocks
 because
 they


will
 leave
 you
 bleeding
 on
 the
 side
 of


the
 road.
 Following
 my
 advice
 will
 leave


you
 bleeding
 on
 the
 side
 of
 the
 road
 if


you
 panic
 and
 sell.
 It's
 100%
 dependent


on
 tying
 yourself
 to
 the
 mass
 during
 the


storm
 and
 ignoring
 the
 volatility
 and


continuing
 to
 invest
 into
 it
 because
 now


you're
 actually
 accumulating
 shares
 on


sale
 because
 prices
 are
 down
 because
 the


storm
 never
 lasts.
 It
 always
 blows
 over


and
 the
 sunshine
 comes
 back
 out
 and


prosperity
 returns.
 You're
 talking
 here


about
 the
 emotional
 side
 of
 investing,


which


>> which
 is
 critical.


>> Yeah.


>> If
 you
 if
 you
 can't
 control
 your


emotions,
 you're
 you're
 going
 to
 be


selling
 at
 the
 wrong
 time
 and
 buying
 at


the
 wrong
 time.


>> So,
 this
 is
 such
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 it
 that


people
 don't
 talk
 about
 enough.
 They


talk
 about
 tactics,
 strategies,
 what
 to


invest
 in,
 etc.
 But
 they
 don't
 talk


about
 the
 emotional
 side,
 which
 is


really
 like
 arguably
 a
 even
 bigger


element
 of
 this
 because
 if
 you
 think


about
 even
 how
 the
 brain
 is
 set
 up
 and


what
 drives
 us
 most,
 it's
 it's
 fear.


It's
 it's
 emotion.


>> You're
 in
 greed.


>> And
 when
 the
 when
 the
 prices
 drop,
 you


know,
 I
 mean,
 we've
 all
 got
 a
 story.
 So


many
 people
 listening.
 I
 remember
 my


first
 ever
 investment.
 I
 put
 £10,000


into
 Facebook
 stock
 a
 long
 long
 long


long
 time
 ago.
 And
 then
 it
 went
 down
 and


I
 sold.


>> I
 thought,
 I'm
 never
 investing
 again.


>> And
 if
 I
 just
 left
 it,


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 God,
 that
 would
 be
 worth
 so
 much


money.
 It
 probably
 be
 worth
 six
 figures


now,


>> right?


>> But
 I
 I
 hadn't,
 no
 one
 had
 ever
 taught


me
 about
 the
 emotional
 side.
 And


actually
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 I
 sold
 it


was
 because
 I
 needed
 that
 money.


>> So
 there's
 two
 things
 there.
 One
 is
 the


emotional
 side
 of
 selling
 it.
 The
 other


thing
 is
 investing
 money
 that
 is
 not
 for


the
 long
 term
 cuz
 you
 turned
 out
 you


should
 never
 invest
 in
 money
 in
 the


stock
 market
 that
 is
 you're
 not
 willing


to
 commit
 for
 decades.
 This
 is
 a


longterm
 horizon
 because
 that's
 what


allows
 you
 to
 weather
 the
 storms.
 If


you're
 saving
 for
 a
 house
 for
 instance,


well
 you
 probably
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 in


the
 stock
 market.
 The
 best
 investor
 I've


ever
 met
 is
 my
 girlfriend.
 Uh
 because


she
 she
 loses
 the
 password
 [laughter]


to
 the
 investing
 app.
 And
 honestly,


every
 like
 two
 years
 I
 go,
 "Babe,
 do
 you


remember?"
 I
 was
 like, "You
 bought
 loads


of
 that
 index
 fund
 or
 Bitcoin
 or


whatever
 it
 is."


>> I
 was
 like, "Do
 you
 know
 the
 price
 of


it?"
 And
 she's
 like, "No,
 I
 forgot.
 I've


forgotten
 the
 password
 to
 the
 app."
 And


we
 always
 like
 log
 back
 in
 once
 every


two
 years
 and
 look
 at
 it.
 I'm
 like, "Oh


my
 god,
 babe.
 You're
 rich."
 And
 she's


like, "Oh,
 okay."
 And
 then
 she
 loses
 the


password
 again.
 She
 forgets
 it.
 This
 is


an
 incredibly
 important
 point
 you
 just


touched
 on.
 So
 Jack
 Bogle,
 the
 guy
 who


created
 retail
 index
 funds
 that
 we
 can


invest
 in
 now,
 created
 the
 Vanguard


Group
 in
 1975.


Bogle
 once
 said,
 you
 know,
 invest
 in
 the


S&P
 500
 and
 don't
 even
 open
 your


statements
 when
 they
 come.
 Just
 let
 them


stay.
 Don't
 even
 open
 them
 for
 20
 years


and
 then
 open
 the
 final
 one
 and
 have
 a


cardiologist
 standing
 by
 because
 you


will
 be
 stunned
 at
 the
 level
 of
 wealth


that
 you've
 accumulated.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 wrote
 this
 this
 book
 for


my
 daughter,
 right?
 My
 daughter
 is


sounds
 like
 she's
 kind
 of
 like
 your


girlfriend.
 She's
 very
 smart,
 but
 she


has
 zero
 interest
 in
 this
 financial


stuff.


That
 is
 a
 superpower
 because
 unlike
 me


and
 maybe
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 listening
 to


us
 who
 are
 interested
 in
 this
 stuff
 and


who
 are
 watching
 the
 market
 all
 the


time,
 she
 and
 your
 girlfriend
 are
 never


going
 to
 be
 tempted
 to
 panic
 when
 the


market
 drops
 because
 they're
 not
 going


to
 notice
 the
 market
 dropped,
 right?


Because
 they're
 they
 don't
 they
 don't


care.
 And
 the
 less
 you
 tinker
 with
 your


investments.


Charlie
 Munger,
 who
 was
 Warren
 Buffett's


partner,
 once
 said,
 "The
 worst
 thing
 you


can
 do
 as
 an
 investor
 is
 get
 in
 the
 way


of
 compounding,
 right?
 And
 that
 means


dancing
 into
 the
 market
 trying
 to
 sell


and
 buy
 back
 in
 and
 what
 have
 you.
 Just


[clears throat]
 let
 the
 compounding


run."
 I
 get
 so
 many
 people
 who
 read
 my


work
 and
 they
 say,
 "Wow,
 JL,
 I
 I
 I


really
 get
 it
 and
 it's
 wonderful
 and


you're
 absolutely
 right
 about


everything,
 but
 if
 we
 just
 did
 this
 one


little
 thing
 differently,
 it
 would
 be


even
 better."
 And
 they
 are
 I've
 come
 to


think
 of
 them
 as
 the
 tinkerers,
 right?


>> Are
 they
 men?


>> They
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 are
 men.
 I


think
 I
 think
 women
 are
 a
 little
 less


inclined
 to
 tinker
 because
 men
 put
 their


masculinity
 on
 the
 line
 in
 doing
 these


things
 and
 that's
 not
 useful.


>> I
 asked
 the
 question
 about
 men
 and
 women


because
 I
 got
 some
 stats
 here
 from


actually
 from
 Vanguard
 that
 says
 men
 are


70%
 more
 likely
 to
 invest
 in
 high-risisk


assets
 like
 individual
 stocks
 versus


safer
 assets
 than
 women.
 Men's
 portfolio


are
 50%
 more
 volatile,
 which
 leads
 to


higher
 potential
 returns,
 but
 also
 huge


greater
 losses.
 As
 it
 relates
 to
 men,


again,
 despite
 having
 higher


risk-taking,
 men
 underperform
 women
 in


long-term
 returns
 annually
 due
 to


overtrading,
 tinkering,


>> and
 timing
 mistakes,
 tinkering.
 And
 men


trade
 45%
 more
 often
 than
 women,


resulting
 in
 more
 fees
 because
 every


time
 they
 make
 a
 trade,
 they
 pay
 a
 fee


and
 lower
 gains.
 That's
 according
 to


Berkshire
 Hathaway.


The
 summary
 here
 is
 that
 men
 take
 more


risks,
 but
 in
 the
 long
 term
 tend
 to
 earn


less
 because
 of
 frequent
 mistakes
 and


emotional
 trading,
 whereas
 women
 are


more
 cautious
 and
 their
 approach
 tends


to
 yield
 better
 returns.


>> So,
 you
 know
 what
 we've
 learned
 here?


>> Yeah.


>> I
 have
 a
 very
 strong
 feminine
 side.


[laughter]


>> Well,
 gosh.
 Yeah.
 Damn.


>> Protecting
 your
 business's
 data
 is
 a
 lot


scarier
 than
 people
 admit.
 You've
 got


the
 usual
 protections,
 backups,


security,
 but
 underneath
 there's
 this


uncomfortable
 truth
 that
 your
 entire


operation
 depends
 on
 systems
 that
 are


updating,
 syncing,
 and
 changing
 data


every
 second.
 Someone
 doesn't
 have
 to


hack
 you
 to
 bring
 everything
 crashing


down.
 All
 it
 takes
 is
 one
 corrupted


file,
 one
 workflow
 that
 fires
 in
 the


wrong
 direction,
 one
 automation
 that


overwrites
 the
 wrong
 thing,
 or
 an
 AI


agent
 drifting
 off
 course,
 and
 suddenly


your
 business
 is
 offline.
 your
 team
 is


stuck

 you're
 in
 damage

 mode.

>> You
 talked
 about
 compounding.
 You
 talked


about
 how
 one
 should
 maybe
 not
 open
 the


envelope
 that
 has
 the
 state.


>> That's
 Jack
 Bogle
 has
 said
 that,
 but
 I


agree
 with
 it.
 Yeah.


>> I
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 explain
 the
 graph
 I've


just
 passed

 for
 you
 to
 know
 what


that
 is,
 right?


>> On

 returns.
 So
 the
 blue
 line
 that's


that's
 running
 fairly
 flat
 is
 the


contributions
 to
 this
 hypothetical


investment
 and
 the
 red
 line
 is
 the
 value


that
 that
 how
 it
 how
 it
 grows.
 And


what's
 striking,
 and
 this
 is
 this
 is


what's
 striking
 about
 compounding
 in


general,
 is
 that
 the
 two
 track
 each


other
 almost
 exactly
 for
 a
 surprisingly


long
 time,
 and
 then
 they
 begin
 to


diverge,
 and
 then
 the
 compounding
 makes


the
 value
 of
 the
 investment
 skyrocket.


It
 hockey
 sticks.


And
 I
 didn't
 know
 you
 were
 going
 to
 show


this
 to
 me,
 but
 what's
 interesting
 to
 me


about
 [clears throat]
 this
 is
 I
 used
 to


do
 these
 shitakas.
 They
 were
 events


where
 we'd
 take
 a
 small
 group
 of
 people


to
 some
 cool
 place
 in
 the
 world
 and
 hang


out.
 And
 there
 were
 people
 who
 followed


my
 work
 and
 and
 I
 would
 have
 one-on-one


sessions
 with
 them
 and
 we
 talk
 about


whatever
 they
 wanted,
 but
 mostly
 it
 was


their
 finances.
 And
 very
 commonly
 these


people
 would
 lay
 out
 their
 their


investments,
 their
 their
 finances,
 and


and


they
 would
 ask,
 "Am
 I
 financially


independent?"
 And
 that's
 a
 there's
 a


very
 simple
 mathematical
 formula
 about


that.
 How
 much
 did
 you
 spend?
 I
 spend


$100,000
 a
 year.
 Okay.
 If
 you
 take
 the


4%
 guideline,
 what's
 that?


>> Withdrawal.
 So,
 a
 guy
 named
 Bill
 Ben


came
 up
 with
 the
 idea
 that
 you
 could


safely
 withdraw
 4%
 of
 your
 portfolio
 and


it
 would
 continue
 to
 survive
 over
 time


and
 it
 would
 so
 you
 could
 you
 could
 pull


that
 out
 without
 depleting
 the


portfolio.
 There
 was
 a
 woman
 who
 came
 to


one
 of
 our
 [ __ ]
 talk.
 She
 was
 a
 banker.


So
 obviously
 knows
 her
 way
 around
 basic


math,
 right?
 She
 was
 at
 the
 end
 of
 Stuck


where
 she
 was
 going
 to
 take
 a
 new
 job


starting
 that
 Monday
 was
 going
 to
 pay


her
 a
 million
 dollars
 a
 year
 [snorts]


and
 we're
 going
 over
 her
 finances
 and


she
 said,
 you
 know,
 I've
 got
 $5
 million


invested.
 Okay.


Am
 I
 financially
 independent?
 Well,
 I


can't
 answer
 that
 question
 until
 I
 know


how
 much
 are
 you
 spending.
 Said,
 well,


I'm
 spending
 $100,000
 a
 year.
 Okay.


Well,


$100,000
 a
 year,
 if
 you
 multiply
 it
 by


25,
 you
 get
 $2.5
 million.


4%
 of
 2
 and
 a.5
 million
 is
 100,000,


right?
 So,
 that's
 how
 that
 math
 works.


So,
 if
 you
 need
 100,000
 to
 live
 on,
 you


need
 2.5
 million
 invested.
 Make
 sense?


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 you
 can
 look
 at
 it
 either
 way.


You
 can
 say,
 I've
 got
 two
 and
 a
 half


million.
 If
 I
 take
 4%
 of
 that
 a
 year,


that's
 100,000.
 or
 I
 I
 I'm
 spending


100,000.
 How
 much
 do
 I
 need?
 You


multiply
 that
 by
 25
 two
 and
 a
 half.


>> So,
 just
 to
 make
 sure
 I'm
 clear,


[snorts]


>> if
 I
 look
 at
 my
 investment
 portfolio
 and


I
 have
 $100
 in
 there,


>> if
 I
 can
 live,
 are
 you
 saying
 that
 if
 I


live
 on
 $4,


which
 is
 4%
 of
 my
 investment
 portfolio,


then
 I'm
 financially
 independent.


>> Right.
 That's
 a
 good
 Now,
 it's
 a
 good


guideline.
 I
 mean
 there's
 lots
 of


variations
 but
 this
 is
 a
 guy
 guideline


this
 financial
 adviser
 Bill
 Benin
 came


up
 with


u
 and
 then
 there
 was
 a
 thing
 called
 the


Trinity
 study
 which
 was
 done
 I
 want
 to


say
 in
 the
 '9s
 that
 looked
 at
 a
 lot
 of


these
 scenarios
 and
 basically
 verified


that
 this
 was
 a
 very
 good
 baseline.
 Um,


so
 4%
 is
 I
 don't
 like
 the
 word
 rule


because
 that
 implies
 that
 it's
 hard
 and


fast,
 but
 it's
 a
 great
 guideline.
 If
 you


want
 to
 have
 a
 have
 an
 idea
 of
 whether


or
 not
 you're
 financially
 independent
 or


not,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 guideline.
 So


anyway,
 this
 woman
 says
 she's
 spending


$100,000
 a
 year
 and
 she's
 got
 5
 million.


She
 wants
 to
 know,
 am
 I
 financially


independent
 in
 financially
 independent?


And
 I
 said,
 times
 two.
 I
 mean,
 you
 have


twice
 as
 much
 money
 as
 you
 need
 given


your
 level
 of
 spending.
 So,
 the
 question


that
 I
 always
 had
 going
 back
 to
 this


little
 chart
 is
 how
 and
 I
 would
 get
 this


question
 a
 lot,
 Stephen.
 You
 know,


they'd
 show
 me
 their
 numbers
 and
 they


would
 very
 clearly
 be
 financially


independent
 on
 that
 based
 on
 that
 math


we
 just
 discussed.
 And
 these
 were
 smart


people
 who
 can
 easily
 do
 basic


arithmetic.
 Said,
 how
 how
 is
 it
 that


they're
 asking
 me
 this
 this
 question?


And
 suddenly
 it
 dawned
 on
 me,
 this
 is


how


because
 compounding


is
 a
 is
 a
 hockey
 stick.
 It
 goes
 along


and
 and
 kind
 of
 doesn't
 appear
 to
 be


happening
 and
 then
 it's
 slowly
 starts
 to


happen
 and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 it's
 way
 up


here.
 It
 happens
 so
 quickly
 and
 so


stunningly
 they
 can't
 quite
 believe
 it.


It
 turned
 out
 is
 not
 that
 they
 couldn't


do
 the
 basic
 math.
 They
 certainly
 could


do
 the
 basic
 math.


What
 it
 was
 is
 they
 couldn't
 quite


[clears throat]
 believe
 what
 the
 math


was
 telling
 them
 and
 they
 wanted
 me
 to.


It's
 like


you
 you
 see
 what's
 on
 that
 wall
 over


there.
 I
 mean,
 are
 you
 seeing
 what
 I'm


seeing?
 Cuz
 I
 can't
 quite
 believe
 that


I'm
 seeing
 that.
 I
 need
 you
 to
 confirm


that.
 Yeah,
 you're
 seeing
 the
 same
 thing


I'm
 seeing.
 And
 in
 this
 example,
 all
 it


is
 is
 someone
 has,
 you
 know,
 they've


started
 with
 zero


>> and
 they've
 paid
 in
 a
 small
 contribution


every
 year
 to
 their
 investment.
 The


investment
 is
 getting
 11%
 return
 a
 year


>> and
 suddenly
 the
 thing
 goes


>> I
 think
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 pivotal


moments
 in
 my
 life
 where
 I
 went
 online


>> five
 six
 years
 ago
 and
 looked
 at
 a


compounding
 interest
 calculator.
 So


>> it's
 stunning.


>> It's
 it
 is
 stunning.


>> It
 is
 absolutely
 stunning.


And
 it
 shows
 that
 if
 you
 just
 leave
 your


money
 in
 a
 place
 where
 it's
 getting
 this


kind
 of
 return


over
 time,


everything
 seems
 to
 take
 care
 of
 itself.


>> So
 let
 me
 let
 me
 close
 the
 circle
 in
 a


sense
 on
 on
 that
 subject
 because
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 I
 think
 gets
 overlooked


with
 my
 book
 is
 this
 is
 the
 simple
 path


to
 wealth.


Which
 means
 if
 you
 follow
 it,
 you
 will


become
 wealthy,
 right?
 So
 we
 go
 back
 to,


you
 know,
 buying
 those
 things
 that


people
 maybe
 want
 to
 buy,
 whether
 it's


the
 fancy
 car
 or
 the
 or
 the
 house.
 Well,


once
 you
 become
 wealthy,
 you
 can
 not


only
 buy
 those
 things,
 but
 you're
 buying


them
 from
 a
 position
 of
 power,
 right?


You
 can
 easily
 afford
 them.
 you
 become


financially
 independent,
 which
 means


that
 your
 investments
 are
 throwing
 off


more
 money
 than
 you're
 spending.
 My
 wife


and
 I
 are
 basically
 uh
 pretty
 naturally


frugal
 people.
 And
 that's
 one
 of
 the


ways
 I
 suppose
 that
 we
 got
 to
 where
 we


are.
 But
 that
 doesn't
 necess
 necessarily


serve
 us
 at
 the
 level
 of
 wealth
 now.
 And


so
 we
 still
 have
 this
 tendency
 to
 say,


"Oh,
 we're
 thinking
 about
 getting
 this


stuff.
 How
 much
 does
 it
 cost?
 And
 do
 we


really
 want
 to
 spend
 that
 money?"
 And


depending
 on
 who
 it
 is,
 either
 she'll


turn
 to
 me
 or
 I'll
 turn
 to
 her
 and
 say,


"Doesn't
 matter.
 It's
 free.
 Everything's


free.
 It
 doesn't."
 And
 that's
 a
 very


liberating
 way
 to
 look
 at
 things.
 So


that's
 where
 the
 simple
 path
 ultimately


will
 will
 get
 you.
 That's
 what
 I
 bought


all
 those
 years
 ago.


>> One
 of
 the
 thoughts
 that
 I
 had,
 which
 I


do
 think
 is
 somewhat
 illogical,
 was
 my


brother
 and
 me
 are
 very
 different


people.
 So
 he
 was
 very,
 very
 frugal
 and


I
 was
 reckless.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 that


I
 self-justified
 my
 recklessness
 was,


well,
 you
 know,
 you've
 got
 to
 enjoy


life.
 And
 I'm
 only
 young
 once,
 so
 I'm


only
 going
 to
 get
 the
 opportunity
 to
 do


some
 of
 these
 things
 that
 are
 part
 of


being
 young
 once,
 going
 to
 a
 nightclub


and
 buying
 champagne
 and
 partying,
 you


know?
 So,
 I
 thought,
 yeah,
 I
 could
 save


and
 save
 and
 save
 and
 save
 and
 I
 could


get
 to,
 you
 know,
 70,
 80
 years
 old
 and


have
 all
 this
 money,
 but
 what
 is
 the


point
 if
 I
 haven't
 like
 enjoyed
 myself?


I
 think
 it
 is
 a
 mistake
 to
 think
 that


you
 need
 to
 spend
 money
 to
 be
 happy,
 to


enjoy
 yourself.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 I


will
 say
 is
 that


it's
 a
 lot
 more
 useful
 having
 money
 at


this
 age
 than
 it
 would
 have
 been
 in
 my


20s
 because


money
 buys
 comfort
 among
 other
 things


and
 comfort
 becomes
 much
 more
 important


to
 you
 as
 you
 age.


They
 did
 a
 study
 where
 they
 put
 people


in
 a
 brain
 imaging
 scanner
 and
 they


asked
 them
 to
 think
 about
 themselves


tomorrow.
 Then
 they
 asked
 them
 to
 think


about
 themselves
 in
 a
 couple
 of
 years.


Then
 they
 asked
 them
 to
 think
 about


themselves
 in
 10
 years
 time
 and
 they


looked
 at
 the
 brain.
 And
 then
 they
 did


another
 study
 where
 they
 got
 the
 same


people
 to
 think
 about
 a
 celebrity.


>> Mhm.


>> That
 they
 didn't
 know.
 I
 think
 it
 was


Matt
 Damon
 or
 someone
 famous
 like
 that.


And
 what
 the
 study
 proved
 was
 that
 we


think
 about
 ourselves
 in
 10
 years
 time


in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 we
 think
 about
 Matt


Damon.
 The
 further
 away


the
 time
 horizon,
 the
 more
 it
 becomes
 a


total
 stranger,
 right?


>> And
 so
 I
 was
 writing
 I
 was
 writing


recently
 for
 a
 chapter
 in
 my
 upcoming


book
 about
 this
 idea
 that
 our
 future


self
 is
 a
 stranger.
 To
 the
 brain,


thinking
 about
 me
 when
 I'm
 60


>> is
 like
 thinking
 about
 Matt
 Damon,


right?


>> I
 don't
 know
 a
 [ __ ]
 guy.


>> So
 why
 do
 I
 care?
 Why
 do
 I
 care
 about


protecting
 him?
 And
 I
 think
 this
 kind
 of


speaks
 to
 what
 we
 were
 saying
 there
 is


young
 people
 and
 even
 me
 as
 a
 young


person
 kind
 of
 didn't
 really
 give
 a
 [ __ ]


about
 60-year-old
 me,


>> right?


>> Like
 I
 I
 it's
 so
 far
 away
 that
 I
 I
 don't


really
 care
 about
 protecting
 his


interest.
 I
 almost
 think
 that's
 a


different
 person.
 He
 can
 figure
 that


out,


>> right?


>> And
 you
 know,
 you
 are
 How
 old
 are
 you


now?


>> I'm
 75.


>> So
 you
 have
 the
 the
 wisdom
 of
 hindsight.


So
 you
 can
 tell
 me
 as
 a
 33y
 old
 what


it's
 like
 to
 be
 both
 33
 and
 75.
 When
 I


was
 33,
 I
 didn't
 think
 about


me
 at
 an
 older
 age
 at
 all.
 I
 mean,
 it


never
 crossed
 my
 mind
 to
 do
 such
 a


thing.
 Right?
 So,
 I
 was
 not
 doing
 what
 I


was
 doing
 for
 the
 benefit
 of
 75year-old


JL.
 I
 was
 doing
 it
 for
 the
 benefit
 of


25-year-old
 JL,
 30-year-old
 JL.
 Right?


remember
 going
 back
 to
 an
 early
 part
 of


our
 conversation


what
 my
 definition
 of
 FU
 money
 it's
 the


money
 that
 you're
 accumulating


before
 that
 gets
 you
 ultimately
 to
 being


financially
 independent
 which
 is
 when


you
 no
 longer
 need
 to
 trade
 your
 labor


for
 money
 right
 your
 money
 is
 doing
 all


that


I
 wanted
 that
 right
 now
 so
 when
 I
 was
 25


I'd
 saved
 the
 princely
 sum
 of
 $5,000


adjusted
 for
 inflation
 to
 be
 about
 25


$30,000
 today.
 U
 and
 I
 wanted
 to
 go
 back


around
 Europe,
 right?
 But
 that
 meant


quitting
 my
 job,
 which
 I
 kind
 of
 liked.


But
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 had
 that
 money
 gave


me
 the
 financial
 strength
 to
 go
 in
 and


negotiate
 that
 deal.
 If
 I
 was
 living


paycheck
 to
 paycheck,
 I
 wouldn't
 have


had
 that.
 I
 was
 far
 from
 being
 fully


financially
 independent.
 So,
 I
 wasn't


doing
 this
 for
 75
 year old
 JL.
 I
 was


doing
 this
 right
 now
 for
 25
 year old
 JL.


And
 it's
 just
 like
 when
 you
 work
 out,


and
 clearly
 you
 do,
 right?
 You
 don't
 go


to
 the
 gym
 thinking,
 at least
 I'm
 making


a
 presumption
 here,
 I'm
 doing
 this
 for


75year-old
 Steven.
 You're
 doing
 this


because
 you
 want
 to
 be
 stronger
 tomorrow


than
 you
 are
 today.
 for
 33
 year olds


even.
 So
 that's
 my
 way
 of
 thinking
 about


it.
 I
 I
 never
 did
 this
 for
 future
 me.


Maybe
 some
 people
 do
 and
 that's
 probably


not
 a
 bad
 exercise.
 It's
 probably
 a
 bit


of
 wisdom
 in
 that.
 I
 wasn't
 that
 smart.


>> So
 you
 would
 you
 would
 save
 $5,000
 a


year.


>> Well,
 in
 those
 days,
 so
 my
 first


professional
 job
 paid
 me
 $10,000
 a
 year


and
 I
 saved
 5,000.
 Yeah,
 I
 saved
 half
 of


it.
 Going
 back
 to
 this
 point
 of


compounding
 and
 how
 how
 important
 it
 is


to
 start
 investing
 in
 things
 that
 will


offer
 you
 compounding
 returns.


>> If
 you
 started
 investing
 $500
 per
 month


and
 you
 got
 an
 annual
 return
 of
 8%


because
 you're
 investing
 in
 some
 of the


things
 that
 we'll
 talk
 about
 in
 a


second.


>> In
 35
 years


you
 will
 be
 a
 millionaire.
 You'll
 have


more
 than
 a
 million
 dollars.
 You'll
 have


1.043
 043
 million


>> over
 those
 35
 years
 you
 would
 have


invested
 about
 $200,000
 but
 you
 would


have
 made
 $850,000


from
 the
 interest
 over
 that
 period
 of


time.


>> Well,
 just
 to
 be
 clarified,
 not


necessarily
 the
 interest,
 but
 the
 growth


cuz
 that
 11%
 is
 not
 interest.
 It's
 it's


growth.
 Some
 of
 it
 might
 be
 uh
 dividends


in
 the
 case
 of
 which
 is
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 form


of
 interest
 you
 can
 think
 of
 but
 it's


not
 just
 just
 to
 be
 technically
 correct


right
 which
 is
 which
 is
 interesting.
 So


if
 I
 was
 when
 I
 was
 born
 if
 my
 parents


had
 put
 $500
 a
 month
 away
 in
 a


investment
 that
 we'll
 talk
 about
 now


>> by
 the
 by
 the
 age
 I
 am
 now
 I
 would
 have


roughly
 been
 a
 millionaire
 just
 from


them
 putting
 $500
 a
 month
 away
 from
 me.


Right.


>> Pretty
 crazy.


>> Yeah.
 But
 that's
 the
 power
 of


compounding.
 I
 mean,
 the,
 you
 know,
 it's


it's
 very
 gratifying
 to
 me
 that
 twice
 a


year
 I
 I'm
 a
 guest
 lecturer
 for
 a
 friend


of
 mine
 who's
 a
 professor
 at
 uh


University
 of
 Colorado
 in
 Boulder.
 And


it's
 always
 fun
 to
 talk
 to
 her
 students


because
 they're
 exceedingly
 bright.
 They


ask
 great
 great
 questions
 and
 it's
 just


stimulating
 for
 me.
 But
 I
 think
 about


these
 young
 people.
 I
 mean,
 these
 are


18,
 19,
 20
 year olds
 who
 are
 thinking


about
 doing
 this
 stuff
 at
 that
 age.
 And


the
 remarkable
 amount
 of
 time
 that
 they


have
 for
 this
 compounding
 to
 work
 for


them,
 it's
 it's
 just
 incredible.
 They


are
 going
 to
 be
 so
 much
 better
 off
 than


if
 not.
 Um,
 so
 let
 me
 throw
 out
 a
 tip


for
 for
 you
 if
 and
 when
 you
 ever
 have


kids
 and
 for
 anybody
 who's
 listening
 who


has
 has
 young
 children,
 you
 know,
 as


your
 kids
 start
 to
 grow
 and
 hopefully


they
 get
 part-time
 jobs,
 right?
 They


start
 whether
 it's
 shoveling
 snow
 or


busting
 tables
 at
 a
 local
 restaurant
 or


whatever
 it
 is
 and
 they
 start
 earning


some
 income.
 Well,
 you
 can
 take
 that


income
 and
 up
 to
 I
 think
 it's
 $7,000
 is


the
 limit
 now.
 Put
 that
 in
 a
 Roth
 IRA


which
 will
 never
 be
 taxed.
 It
 will
 grow


tax-free
 forever
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 be


by
 definition
 because
 they're
 making


almost
 no
 money
 in
 in
 they're
 not
 paying


any
 income
 tax.
 So,
 you
 don't
 need
 any


any
 deduction
 from
 that.
 And
 it
 doesn't


have
 to
 be
 their
 money.
 So,
 let's
 say


your
 kid
 makes
 $3,000
 during
 the
 course


of
 a
 year.


you
 can
 take
 $3,000
 and
 fund
 a
 Roth
 IRA


for
 them.
 Imagine
 just
 if
 they
 never


added
 anything
 other
 than
 that,
 you


know,
 you
 do
 that
 until
 they
 they
 get


out
 of
 college
 or
 whatever.
 You
 know,


that
 baseline
 is
 going
 to
 grow
 tax-free


for
 an
 extended
 period
 of
 time.
 That's


one
 of
 the
 great
 keys
 to
 wealth
 building


is
 just
 time.
 And
 and
 is
 that
 advice


that
 you
 still
 believe
 in
 that
 people


should
 be
 saving
 50%
 of
 their
 income?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 rule
 of
 thumb.


It
 gets
 you
 to
 financial
 independence
 in


a
 pretty
 reasonable
 depending
 on
 what


the
 market
 does
 in
 say
 a
 10
 to
 15
 year


time
 period.
 The
 push
 back
 that
 you


might
 anticipate
 is
 from
 people
 who
 say


that's
 impossible.
 Nobody
 can
 save
 50%


of
 their
 money.
 Just
 that's
 that's


that's
 silly.
 And
 I'm
 sorry,
 but
 I've


did
 it
 and
 I've
 now
 at
 this
 point
 I've


known
 countless
 people
 who've
 done
 it.


So,
 it's
 certainly
 you
 may
 choose
 not
 to


do
 it,
 but
 it's
 certainly
 possible.


>> Let's
 say
 you're
 earning
 $40,000


a
 year,
 which
 is
 the
 low
 end,


>> the
 average
 medium.
 So,
 that
 would
 be


let's
 say
 $3,000
 a
 month.


>> Mhm.


>> So,
 you're
 you're
 earning
 $3,000
 a


month.
 You're
 then
 going
 to
 pay
 tax
 on


that.
 This
 is
 what
 my
 my
 math
 says
 here.


It
 says
 very
 little
 tax
 would
 be
 would


be
 paid
 after
 all
 of
 your
 taxes.
 And
 so


you're
 still
 you've
 still
 got
 roughly


$3,000
 a
 month,
 about
 2,900
 um
 which
 you


you
 would
 take
 home.


>> I
 so
 I
 would
 need
 to
 save
 1,400
 of
 that


which
 means
 my
 total
 expenses
 need
 to
 be


1,400
 a
 month.
 So
 first
 thing
 I
 need
 to


do
 is
 live
 somewhere
 very
 very


affordable


>> depending
 where
 I
 live,
 you
 know,
 what


city
 I
 live
 in.


>> Then
 I
 need
 to
 basically
 radically


reduce
 my
 my
 expenditure,
 right,


>> to
 be
 able
 to
 save
 50%
 a
 month.
 And
 I


guess
 the
 question
 is
 most
 people


would
 assume
 they
 wouldn't
 like
 that


lifestyle.


They
 wouldn't
 like
 to
 prepare
 their
 own


lunches
 every
 day.
 They
 wouldn't
 like
 to


not
 have
 a
 Starbucks
 coffee.
 They


wouldn't
 like
 to
 live
 in
 a
 small
 small


shoe
 box
 and
 probably
 socialize
 a
 lot


less.


>> So
 I
 guess
 that's
 the
 key
 rebuttal
 is
 I


guess
 yeah,
 it's
 possible.


There's
 a
 chapter
 that
 talks
 about
 this


with
 an
 even
 lower
 uh
 because
 when
 I
 was


writing
 the
 book
 um
 I
 think
 I
 used
 a


$25,000


annual
 income.
 So
 the
 math
 works
 is
 is


it
 easy?
 No.
 But
 it
 goes
 back
 to


fundamentally


what
 is
 it
 that
 you
 want?
 You
 said
 well


I
 may
 not
 want
 like
 that.
 I
 might
 want


to
 have
 lattes
 and
 all
 these
 other


things.
 Well
 it's
 your
 money.
 That's


your
 prerogative.


But
 time
 is
 going
 to
 happen
 regardless


of
 what
 you
 do.
 And
 if
 you
 say,
 "Instead


of
 having
 those
 things
 now,
 I'm
 going
 to


spend
 my
 money
 on
 buying
 my
 freedom,"


you
 will
 get
 to
 the
 point
 where


everything
 is
 free,
 including
 those


lattes.


>> So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 investing
 then.


>> Um,
 we
 have
 two
 buckets
 here
 on
 the


table
 for
 an
 analogy


>> around
 tax
 advantaged
 investing.


I'm
 going
 to
 take
 your
 lead
 on
 this.


>> Okay.
 So,
 if
 you
 dump
 that
 bucket
 in


there,
 I'll
 dump
 this
 bucket
 in
 here.


Okay.


The
 idea
 is
 that
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 speak


in
 terms
 of
 the
 United
 States.
 The


government
 provides


savings
 vehicles
 that
 are
 tax
 advantage


to
 encourage
 people
 to
 acquire
 money
 for


their
 for
 their
 old
 age.
 Right?
 So
 in


the
 United
 States
 there's
 things
 called


a
 401k
 or
 403b.


Uh
 these
 are
 employer
 related
 plans


where
 you
 can
 divert
 part
 of
 your
 income


and
 the
 government
 specifies
 how
 much


you
 can
 divert
 and
 they
 won't
 tax
 you
 on


that
 and
 you
 put
 it
 into
 an
 investment


bucket
 into
 an
 investment
 account
 of


some
 sort.
 you
 get
 to
 choose
 how
 you


want
 to
 invest
 it,
 but
 that
 would
 be
 the


bucket.
 And
 that
 means
 that
 if
 you
 had


however
 much
 money
 this
 represents


uh
 went
 into
 your
 401k
 or
 your
 IRA,


which
 is
 something
 you
 would
 do
 on
 your


own
 privately,
 which
 is
 also
 tax


advantaged,
 right?
 So,
 in
 the
 example


that
 you've
 just
 [clears throat]
 handed


me,
 they're
 saying
 that
 this
 would


represent
 $20,750,


which
 is
 uh
 before
 tax
 and
 with
 a
 match.


So,
 401ks
 companies
 will
 frequently


match
 part
 of
 your
 contribution.
 So,
 you


say,
 "I'm
 going
 to
 do
 5%."
 And
 they


might
 say,
 "Okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 match


the
 first
 2%
 or
 whatever,"
 which
 you


should
 always
 take
 advantage
 of
 because


that's
 that's
 free
 money.
 So
 this
 is
 not


taxed
 immediately
 and
 you
 invest
 this


money.
 Let's
 say
 you
 invest
 it
 in
 a


total
 stock
 market
 index
 fund
 which


would
 be
 my
 recommendation.
 So
 you
 get


to
 invest
 all
 this
 money
 in
 your
 total


stock
 market
 index
 fund.
 If
 instead
 you


do
 it
 after
 you
 pay
 taxes
 on
 the
 same


amount
 of
 money,
 well,
 by
 the
 time
 you


pay
 taxes,
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 about


half
 of
 what
 it
 was
 before,
 which
 is


$10,340,


which
 is
 what
 represented
 in
 here


roughly
 half
 the
 number
 of
 of
 gold


coins.
 Now,
 both
 of
 these
 things
 grow
 at


the
 same
 rate
 because
 we've
 invested


them
 in
 the
 same
 thing,
 right?
 So,


they're
 making
 11%
 a
 year,
 whatever
 it


is.
 So
 this
 is
 obviously
 going
 to
 grow


into
 a
 much
 bigger
 pile
 at
 the
 end
 of
 30


years
 or
 40
 years
 or
 whatever
 it
 is
 than


this
 is
 because
 you're
 starting
 with
 a


bigger
 pile.
 So
 that's
 the
 advantage
 of


deferring
 taxes.
 Now,
 the
 thing
 that


people
 tend
 not
 to
 think
 about
 or
 talk


about
 that's
 incredibly
 important
 is


that
 it
 is
 not
 avoiding
 taxes.
 It
 is


deferring
 taxes.
 Which
 means
 that


ultimately
 the
 government
 is
 going
 to


want
 their
 money.
 They're
 going
 to
 want


their
 cut.
 And
 typically
 that
 happens,
 I


think
 in
 the
 United
 States
 the
 age
 is
 73


or
 something
 when
 you're
 required
 to


begin
 taking
 money
 out
 of
 these


accounts.
 It's
 called
 an
 RMD,
 a
 required


minimum
 distribution.


So,
 if
 you
 haven't
 started
 withdrawing


money
 from
 these
 accounts,
 by
 then
 the


government
 will
 require
 you
 to
 begin
 on


a
 schedule
 based
 on
 your
 life
 expectancy


to
 start
 pulling
 that
 money
 out
 because


they
 figure
 they've
 waited
 long
 enough


and
 now
 they
 want
 their
 cut.
 Okay?


[clears throat]
 So,
 it's
 not
 tax-free,


it's
 tax
 deferred.
 Important
 thing
 to


understand
 if
 you
 start
 taking
 this


money
 out
 before
 a
 certain
 age
 and
 if


memory
 serves
 me
 it's
 59
 and
 a
 half
 in


the
 US
 then
 you
 will
 pay
 tax
 on
 it
 as


you
 do
 whenever
 you
 withdraw
 the
 money


and
 also
 a
 penalty
 right
 so
 they
 want


you
 to
 keep
 it
 in
 at
 least
 until
 you're


59
 and
 a
 half
 but
 they
 want
 you
 to
 start


taking
 it
 out
 at
 some
 point
 in
 this
 case


I
 think
 when
 you're
 72
 or
 73
 or


something
 like
 and
 That's
 when
 they


collect
 their
 money.
 So
 you
 say,
 well,


okay,
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 then
 what
 am
 I


doing
 here?
 Because
 I
 got
 to
 pay
 the


taxes
 eventually
 anyway.
 And


mathematically,
 if
 your
 tax
 rate
 is
 the


same,
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 if
 you're
 tax


deferred
 or
 not.
 The
 end
 result
 of


amount
 of
 money
 that
 you
 have
 will
 be


exactly
 the
 same.


The
 speculation
 is,
 and
 it's
 true
 in
 the


vast
 majority
 of
 cases,
 that
 when
 you


retire
 and
 you
 start
 living
 on
 this


money,
 you
 start
 pulling
 it
 out,
 you


will
 be
 in
 a
 lower
 tax
 bracket.
 So,
 you


will
 have
 to
 pay
 some
 taxes,
 but
 you


won't
 have
 to
 pay
 as
 much
 as
 when
 you


were
 working
 and
 you
 were
 in
 a
 higher


tax
 bracket.
 So,
 that's
 the
 gamble


you're
 taking.
 Now,
 looking
 at
 me


personally
 as
 an
 example,
 this
 didn't


work
 out
 for
 me.
 So,
 I
 did
 IAS
 and
 401ks


when
 I
 was
 working
 in
 my
 corporate


career.
 Put
 aside
 a
 fair
 amount
 of
 money


in
 them.
 Now,
 as
 it
 turns
 out,
 I'm
 in
 a


higher
 tax
 bracket
 than
 I
 have
 ever
 been


in
 because
 of
 the
 success
 of
 the


activities
 that
 I
 do
 today.
 I
 had
 no


idea
 that
 that
 was
 going
 to
 happen.
 And


now
 I'm
 at
 that
 age
 where
 I
 have
 to
 take


RMDs.
 So
 RMDs
 are
 coming
 out
 at
 a
 higher


tax
 rate
 for
 me
 than
 when
 I
 than
 the
 tax


benefit
 I
 got
 deferring
 it.
 But
 that's


unusual.
 Most
 people
 will
 benefit
 from


doing
 this
 because
 in
 their
 retirement


they
 won't
 have
 an
 income
 or
 their


income
 will
 be
 very
 modest
 and
 their
 tax


rate
 will
 be
 equally
 modest
 and
 it
 will


work
 out
 very
 nicely
 for
 them.
 But


that's
 basically
 how
 that
 works.
 Does


that
 make
 sense?


>> It
 does.
 Yes.
 And
 and
 to
 try
 and


summarize
 it
 um
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I
 fully


understand
 to
 check
 I
 understand
 is


every
 month
 when
 I'm
 paid
 I
 have
 an


opportunity
 before
 that
 money
 comes
 to


me
 to
 invest
 some
 of
 it
 and
 around
 the


world
 whether
 it's
 Japan,
 Switzerland,


India,
 South
 Korea,
 Germany,
 Australia,


UK,
 Canada,
 there's
 always
 some
 kind
 of


system


>> of
 this,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 can
 say
 okay
 I'm
 going
 to
 get


paid


$1,000
 this
 month.
 I'm
 gonna
 put
 a
 $100


of
 that
 before
 I
 even
 get
 it
 into
 one
 of


these
 investment
 accounts.
 It's
 not


going
 to
 be
 taxed
 until


>> and
 your
 employer
 might
 match
 part
 of
 it


or
 all
 of
 it.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 my
 employer
 might
 also
 add


$100
 to
 it
 [clears throat]
 or
 or
 part
 of


it.
 That's
 going
 to
 compound
 over
 time.


I
 can
 take
 it
 out
 whenever
 I
 want,
 but


if
 I
 take
 it
 out
 early,
 I
 get
 a
 penalty.


>> And
 you
 pay
 tax.


>> And
 I
 pay
 tax.
 But
 assuming
 that
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 be
 earning
 as
 much
 as
 I
 do
 now


when
 I'm
 older,
 when
 I
 take
 it
 out
 at
 65


years
 old,
 I'm
 still
 going
 to
 pay
 tax,


but
 a
 low
 rate
 of
 tax.


>> There's
 no
 penalty
 at
 that
 point,
 but


and
 presumably
 you'll
 be
 at
 a
 lower
 tax


rate,
 right?


>> So
 it
 really
 only
 works
 if
 you're
 at
 a


lower
 tax
 rate
 when
 you're
 older.


>> Exactly.
 So
 most
 people
 work
 and
 then


and
 then
 they
 retire
 at
 a
 certain
 age


and
 that
 income
 from
 their
 job
 goes


away.
 So
 by
 definition,
 they're
 in
 a


much
 lower
 tax
 bracket.
 So
 for
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 people,
 this
 works
 out
 very


nicely.


>> And
 you
 talk
 about,
 you
 know,
 because


people
 will
 will
 still
 have
 to
 make
 a


decision
 what
 they
 want
 to
 invest
 in,


>> right?


>> Where
 do
 you
 think
 we
 should
 be


investing
 our
 money
 at
 this
 moment
 of


time?
 The
 for
 the
 average
 person,
 what


what
 should
 they
 be
 putting
 their
 money


into
 with
 everything
 you
 see
 happening


in
 the
 world?


>> Yeah.


>> You
 said
 not
 Bitcoin,
 but
 what
 where


should
 we
 put
 it?


>> I'm
 an
 advocate
 of
 investing
 in


broad-based
 lowcost
 stock
 index
 funds.


>> What
 is
 that?
 That
 is
 an
 example
 of
 that


is
 VTSAX
 which
 is
 Vanguard's
 total
 stock


market
 index
 fund.
 It
 invests
 in


virtually
 every
 publicly
 traded
 company


in
 the
 United
 States
 of
 America.
 That's


very
 the
 number
 of
 those
 varies,
 but


it's
 roughly
 3,600
 companies.


>> So
 you're
 basically
 investing
 in


America.


>> There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 private
 companies


that
 I
 that
 I'm
 not
 invested
 in,
 but
 I'm


in
 every
 publicly
 traded
 company
 in
 in


the
 country.
 And
 that
 means
 everybody


from
 the
 factory
 floor
 to
 the
 CEO
 is


working
 to
 make
 me
 richer.
 Now,
 some
 of


those
 companies
 are
 going
 to
 do


extraordinarily
 well
 and
 they're
 going


to
 succeed
 dramatically.
 And
 because


this
 fund,
 as
 most
 funds
 like
 it
 are,
 is


cap
 weighted
 and
 I'll
 explain
 that
 in
 a


minute.
 The
 more
 successful
 the
 company


is,
 the
 more
 of
 it
 I
 will
 own.
 So
 cap


weighted
 simply
 means
 that
 the
 largest


larger
 the
 market
 capitalization
 of
 the


company
 is


>> the
 valuation


>> the
 valuation
 [clears throat]
 right
 the


market
 capital
 the
 larger
 that
 is
 the


greater
 the
 percentage
 of
 the
 fund
 it


will
 represent.
 So,
 you
 may
 have
 heard


people
 say
 that
 the
 top
 10
 companies
 in


the
 S&P
 500
 have
 an
 outsized


representation


uh
 percentage-
 wise
 of
 what
 they
 well


that's
 the
 reason
 it's
 it's
 cap


weighted.
 So,
 I
 benefit
 from
 that


success.
 Right
 now,
 if
 one
 of
 those


companies
 falters


and


starts
 failing
 on
 their
 execution
 or
 a


more
 aggressive,
 better
 organized


competitor
 comes
 along
 and
 displaces


them,
 then
 they
 will
 drift
 away.
 But
 I'm


okay
 with
 that
 because
 whatever
 that
 new


competitor
 is,
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 predict


who
 it
 is.
 I
 will
 own
 them.
 And
 that's
 a


process
 that
 I
 refer
 to
 as


self-cleansing.
 I'm
 very
 proud
 of
 that


term
 that
 I
 that
 I
 coined.
 So,
 a
 great


example
 of
 that
 is
 Sears.
 When
 I
 was
 a


kid,
 Sears,
 company
 you
 may
 not
 even
 be


aware
 of,
 but
 Sears
 was
 the
 Walmart
 and


Amazon
 of
 its
 time
 combined,
 but
 Sears


at
 the
 turn
 of
 the
 last
 century,
 the


turn
 of
 the
 1800s,
 looked
 around
 and


said,
 you
 know,
 we
 have
 these


brickandmortar
 stores,
 but
 there
 are
 all


these
 people
 living
 out
 in
 rural
 areas


who
 are
 never
 going
 to
 get
 to
 our


brickandmortar
 stores.
 We
 could
 send


them
 cataloges.
 Does
 this
 begin
 to
 sound


familiar?
 And
 then
 they
 could
 send
 us


letters
 and
 money
 ordering
 things
 from


our
 catalog
 that
 we
 could
 then
 ship
 to


them.
 So
 they
 became,
 you
 know,
 Walmart


with
 the
 brick-andmortar
 stores
 and
 then


Amazon
 of
 his
 time
 absolutely
 dominated


for
 100
 years.
 If
 you
 had
 said
 to


somebody
 when
 I
 was
 first
 uh
 investing


in
 the
 1970s
 that
 Sears
 Sears
 built
 the


biggest
 building
 on
 the
 planet
 back
 in


the
 '7s,
 what
 was
 then
 known
 as
 the


Sears
 Tower
 in
 Chicago.
 If
 you
 had
 said


Sears
 its
 days
 are
 numbered,
 you
 would


have
 been
 laughed
 at.
 But
 its
 days
 were


numbered
 because
 leaner,
 more
 aggressive


competitors
 came
 along
 and
 ate
 its


lunch.
 Nobody
 could
 have
 predicted
 that.


Certainly
 not
 me,
 but
 I
 didn't
 have
 to


if
 I
 own
 the
 index
 because
 then
 when


Walmart
 came
 along
 and
 then
 later
 Amazon


and
 Sears
 faded
 away,
 I
 own
 those
 as


well.
 That's
 that
 self-cleansing


process.


>> And
 just
 for
 anyone
 that
 really
 doesn't


understand
 this
 at
 all,
 you're
 not


actually
 having
 to
 do
 anything
 because


that
 index
 fund
 is
 just
 automatically


making
 the
 decisions.


>> Exactly.
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 do
 anything.
 I


just
 have
 to
 own
 it
 and
 I
 can
 own
 it


forever.
 So,
 if
 I
 went
 and
 I
 bought


Sears
 stock
 as
 an
 example
 back
 in
 the


day,
 well,
 whenever
 you
 own
 an


individual
 stock,
 you're
 going
 to
 be


thinking
 about,
 okay,
 how
 long
 am
 I


going
 to
 own
 this?
 And
 what
 is
 going
 to


trigger
 my
 sale
 of
 this
 particular


asset?
 And
 what
 I
 mean,
 what
 has
 to


happen
 to
 it
 that
 would
 make
 me
 not
 want


to
 own
 it
 anymore?
 And
 then,
 if
 I
 want


to
 get
 rid
 of
 it
 and
 I
 want
 something
 in


the
 same
 space,
 what
 do
 I
 buy?
 Do
 I
 buy


this
 new
 upstart
 Walmart?
 you
 know,
 do
 I


buy
 this
 Amazon
 that
 back
 in
 the
 90s
 is


run
 by
 this
 wacko
 guy,
 Jeff
 Bezos,
 who


kept
 saying,
 "No,
 profits
 don't
 matter.


Profits
 don't
 matter."
 What
 who's
 who


invests
 in
 a
 CEO
 that
 says
 profits
 don't


matter?
 I
 mean,
 that's
 nuts,
 right?
 But


those
 are
 the
 kinds
 of
 things
 you
 have


to
 be
 have
 to
 be
 thinking
 about
 if
 you


own
 individual
 stocks.
 I
 don't
 have
 to


think
 about
 any
 of
 that
 owning
 the
 index


because
 if
 Jeff
 Bezos
 turns
 out
 that
 his


wackiness
 is
 brilliance,
 which
 it
 turns


out
 it
 was,
 then
 he's
 going
 to
 rise
 to


the
 top,
 which
 it
 turns
 out
 Amazon
 did,


and
 I
 benefited
 from
 that.
 If
 it
 turns


out
 it
 was
 just
 wackiness,
 it
 would
 have


just
 faded
 away
 as
 a
 lot
 of
 companies


have.
 But
 that
 wouldn't
 have
 mattered


cuz
 whatever
 succeeds,
 I
 will
 I
 will
 own


and
 benefit
 from.
 I
 was
 asking
 um
 the


research
 team
 beforehand


>> in
 the
 last
 10
 years
 which
 index
 fund


has
 performed
 the
 very
 very
 best


>> and
 it
 said
 that
 the
 NASDAQ
 100
 which
 is


very
 techheavy


>> right


>> has
 performed
 at
 almost
 20%
 a
 year
 for


the
 last
 10
 years
 and
 when
 I
 think
 about


what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 world
 at
 the


moment
 and
 the
 advent
 of
 this
 new


technology
 called
 AI
 which
 is
 driving


everything
 it
 seems
 and
 our
 lives
 are


going
 to
 become
 way
 more
 technological


with
 robots
 bots
 and
 automation
 and
 full


self-driving.
 It
 appears
 to
 me
 like
 if


there
 was
 ever
 a
 great
 time
 to
 be


investing
 in
 an
 index
 fund,
 one
 should


aim
 at
 the
 very
 techheavy
 index
 funds


like
 the
 NASDAQ
 100.


>> Mhm.


>> Is
 that
 is
 is
 that
 logical
 thinking
 or


is
 that


>> it's
 it's
 logical
 think?
 Yes.
 So
 first


of
 all
 it's
 logical
 thinking
 and


actually
 had
 you
 done
 that
 same
 analysis


10
 years
 ago
 you
 would
 have
 done
 better


than
 than
 uh
 VTSAX
 right
 because


technology
 has
 absolutely
 dominated
 for


the
 last
 10
 years
 it
 is
 a
 reasonable


speculation
 that
 that
 will
 continue
 into


the
 future.


>> So
 why
 don't
 you


>> for
 some
 period
 of
 time?


>> Well
 because
 the
 truth
 is
 that


technology
 has
 not
 always
 dominated.


We're
 not
 going
 to
 go
 backwards
 though,


are
 we?


>> Well,
 no,
 but
 the
 point
 is
 that
 that
 it


changes.
 So,
 just
 like
 in
 my
 Sears


example,
 Sears
 would
 have
 been
 at
 the


top
 of
 the
 index
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and


then
 it
 drifted
 away
 and
 got
 replaced.


So,
 that's
 an
 individual
 stock.
 Sectors


of
 stocks
 have
 also
 done
 that
 over
 time,


right?
 So,
 right
 now
 the
 dominant
 sector


is
 tech.
 Wasn't
 always
 the
 case.
 might


not
 always
 be
 the
 case
 in
 the
 future.
 I


don't
 know
 cuz
 I
 can't
 see
 the
 future.
 I


understand
 people
 who
 would
 say
 that


clearly
 that's
 the
 best
 bet
 to
 go
 with


tech
 and
 your
 crystal
 [clears throat]


ball
 is
 clearer
 than
 mine
 and
 you
 might


very
 well
 be
 right.
 But
 I
 don't
 have
 a


crystal
 ball
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 worry


about
 that
 owning
 the
 total
 stock
 market


because
 if
 you're
 right,
 I
 will
 still


benefit
 very
 nicely.
 Thank
 you
 very


much.


If
 you're
 wrong,


whatever
 replaces
 it,
 I
 will
 own.


>> So,
 you
 have
 an
 analogy
 you
 came
 up
 with


that
 involves
 beer
 and
 a
 glass,


>> right?
 Probably
 came
 up
 with
 a
 drinking


beer.
 We
 go
 ahead.


>> Well,
 show
 me
 show
 me
 the
 analogy.


>> So,


thanks
 for
 not
 Whoa.


>> Oh,
 here
 we
 go.


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 say,
 thanks
 for
 not


shaking
 up
 the
 can.


>> So,
 beer,
 right?
 So,
 I'm
 pouring
 it


right
 down
 the
 middle.
 So,
 we
 get
 a
 nice


thick
 head.
 That's
 even
 a
 little
 thicker


than
 I
 hoped
 for.
 Okay.
 So,


imagine
 for
 a
 second.
 Right
 now,
 we
 have


a
 glass
 and
 we
 can
 see
 exactly
 how
 much


foam
 there
 is
 and
 how
 much
 actual
 beer


there
 is,
 right?
 But
 imagine
 this
 was


that
 I
 poured
 it
 into
 this
 vessel


instead
 where
 we
 couldn't
 see
 that.


The
 analogy
 is
 the
 stock
 market.
 So,


when
 most
 people
 think
 of
 the
 stock


market
 and
 when
 most
 people
 turn
 on
 uh


CNBC,
 they
 turn
 on,
 you
 know,
 they
 look


at
 at
 at
 the
 investment
 news
 and
 what


have
 you,
 it's
 all
 this
 churning
 and


trading,
 you
 know,
 what
 stocks
 are
 hot


now,
 what
 stocks
 are
 rising,
 what
 stocks


are
 falling,
 what's,
 you
 know,
 it's
 all


this
 trading.
 That's
 not
 the
 simple
 path


to
 wealth.
 That's
 the
 foam,
 right?
 So


the
 value
 in
 a
 stock,
 whatever
 the
 stock


is,
 what
 makes
 up
 the
 price
 of
 that


stock
 is
 a
 combination
 of
 two
 things.
 It


is
 the
 beer
 and
 it
 is
 the
 foam.
 And
 the


problem
 is
 unlike
 that
 glass,


it's
 in
 a
 vessel
 like
 this.
 So
 it's
 hard


to
 see
 exactly
 how
 much
 beer
 there
 is
 as


opposed
 to
 how
 much
 foam
 there
 is.


>> And
 the
 beer
 is
 the
 value.
 The
 foam
 is


the
 speculation.


>> Exactly.
 The
 beer
 is
 the
 fundamental


operating
 value
 of
 the
 company,
 right?


The
 sales
 and
 the
 expenses
 and
 the
 money


that's
 left
 over
 that
 you
 call
 profits,


right?


>> Yeah.


>> So
 that's
 the
 beer.
 The
 foam
 is
 what
 the


market


determines
 that's
 worth
 at
 any
 given


moment
 based
 on
 emotion,


>> based
 and
 hype
 and
 speculation
 and
 fear


and
 greed.
 And
 so
 up
 here,
 right,
 is
 the


total
 value
 of
 the
 stock,


>> right?
 Exactly.
 The
 total
 value
 of
 the


stock.
 But
 this
 is
 all
 foam
 that
 can


come
 and
 go
 very
 quickly,
 right?
 So
 let


think
 about
 Tesla
 for
 an
 example,
 right?


Tesla
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 foam
 cuz
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 speculating
 about
 the
 great


things
 Tesla's
 going
 to
 do
 in
 the


future.
 robotic
 cars,
 humanoid
 robots,


you
 know,
 all
 these
 kinds
 of
 things


which
 very
 may
 well
 come
 to
 pass.
 I


mean,
 Elon
 Musk
 is
 a
 stunningly


brilliant
 guy.
 So,
 who
 knows?
 But
 that's


the
 speculation.
 That's
 the
 foam.
 The


underlying
 beer
 of
 Tesla,
 the
 actual


operating
 company,
 does
 not
 justify
 the


price
 of
 the
 stock.
 I
 mean,
 the
 the
 PE


ratio
 of
 Tesla,
 you
 can
 look
 it
 up,
 is


some
 huge
 number,
 right?
 So
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 speculation,
 a
 lot
 of
 foam
 in


Tesla.
 Now
 if
 things
 go
 to
 plan,
 then


that
 foam
 will
 become
 as
 as
 in
 our


example,
 you
 notice
 the
 foam
 is


dissipating.
 We're
 getting
 more
 and
 more


beer.
 If
 things
 go
 to
 plan
 for
 Tesla,


that's
 what
 will
 happen.
 The
 foam
 will


will
 eventually
 settle
 out
 into
 more
 and


more
 beer,
 and
 Tesla
 will
 justify
 that


high
 price
 and
 maybe
 then
 some.
 And
 I


guess
 Warren
 Buffett's
 greatness,
 if


I've
 interpreted
 his
 writing
 correctly,


and
 why
 he
 was
 often
 considered
 as
 the


greatest
 investor
 of
 all
 time,
 was
 he


was
 able
 to
 pay
 for
 stocks
 where
 it
 was


mainly
 beer.
 And
 he
 paid
 at
 the
 price
 of


the
 beer,
 not
 for
 the
 foam.


>> Or
 he
 he
 looked
 for
 times
 where
 the


sentiment
 was
 so
 negative
 that
 he
 was


actually
 paying
 a
 little
 less
 than
 the


price
 of
 the
 beer.
 Benjamin
 Graham
 who


who
 wrote
 uh
 the
 intelligent
 investor


who
 was
 a
 mentor
 to
 Warren
 Buffett


uh
 basically
 said
 what
 you
 should
 do
 is


look
 for
 value
 companies
 and
 try
 to


determine
 where
 the
 beer
 is
 and
 then
 try


to
 see
 if
 you
 can
 get
 a
 buying


opportunity
 watch
 it
 where
 you
 can
 buy


it
 for
 less
 than
 the
 actual
 value
 of
 the


operation.
 That's
 ideal.
 And
 in
 those


days
 when
 there
 wasn't
 so
 much


information
 freely
 available
 that
 was


probably
 a
 little
 easier
 to
 do.
 What


Warren
 Buffett
 has
 said
 since
 then
 and


that's
 a
 great
 foundation
 if
 you're


going
 to
 pick
 individual
 stocks.
 But


what
 Warren
 Buffett
 has
 said
 since
 then


is
 he
 learned
 and
 I
 think
 and
 you
 don't


quote
 me
 on
 this
 but
 I
 think
 it
 was


Charlie
 Munger
 who
 actually
 made
 this


point
 to
 him
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 very


very
 hard
 in
 this
 day
 and
 age
 even
 when


they
 started
 back
 in
 the
 60s
 to
 find


companies
 where
 you
 can
 actually
 buy
 it


for
 less
 than
 the
 actual
 beer
 value.
 So


don't
 try
 to
 do
 that.
 Just
 try
 to
 find


companies
 that
 you
 can
 pay
 a
 fair
 price


for
 that
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 beer
 in
 the
 mix


that
 are
 mostly
 beer.
 Because
 if
 you
 buy


those
 companies,
 they
 are
 by
 definition


very
 well-run
 companies,
 strong
 brands,


big
 moes
 around
 them,
 which
 makes
 them


hard
 to
 compete.


>> I
 guess
 to
 do
 this,
 you're
 going to
 have


to
 have
 a
 framework
 for
 valuing
 a


company.


>> Exactly.
 And
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to


have
 great
 discipline,


>> which
 is


>> Yeah.


>> hard.
 And
 that's
 what
 you
 know
 as
 Warren


Buffett
 said
 I
 was
 blessed
 with
 an


ability
 to
 allocate
 capital
 effectively


and
 that's
 basically
 what
 he
 has
 done.


He's
 has
 capital
 and
 he
 is
 got
 the


ability
 to
 look
 at
 different
 companies


and
 say
 of
 all
 the
 different
 companies
 I


could
 allocate
 capital
 to
 he's
 pretty


skilled
 at
 at
 picking
 the
 ones
 that
 are


are
 the
 best
 bets.
 One
 of
 the
 things


that
 I
 really
 admired
 about
 Warren


Buffett
 was
 his
 ability
 to
 do
 nothing,


>> which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 key
 things
 because


that
 goes
 back
 to
 Charlie
 Munger's


thing,
 don't
 get
 in
 the
 way
 of
 your


compounding,
 right?


>> And
 there
 has
 been
 recent
 times
 where
 I


think
 we
 can
 all
 think
 of
 where


using
 your
 beer
 analogy,
 something


happens
 in
 the
 world
 and
 the
 true
 value


of
 a
 company


is
 higher
 than
 the
 selling
 price.
 I.e.


If
 you
 go
 back
 to
 March
 2020
 during
 the


the
 market
 selloff
 when
 the
 pandemic


happened
 and
 everybody
 panicked,
 Amazon,


for
 example,
 the
 stock
 briefly
 dropped


below
 roughly
 to
 about
 $1,500


per
 share.


>> Mhm.


>> Well
 [clears throat]
 below
 its
 intrinsic


value
 um
 because
 people
 were
 panicking,


right?


>> Uh
 and
 then
 it
 quickly
 rebounded
 again


past
 $3,000


a
 share.
 So
 theoretically,
 if
 you
 had


noticed
 that
 drop,
 you
 could
 have
 made
 a


100%
 return
 on
 your
 money.
 Um,


>> and
 by
 the
 extension,
 the
 whole
 market


did
 that.


>> The
 whole
 market
 dropped,
 too.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 you
 could
 have
 done
 that
 with
 your


index
 fund.
 This
 is
 why
 if
 you
 panicked


and
 sold.


>> Yeah.


>> Let's
 say
 you
 owned
 Amazon
 or
 you
 owned


VTSAX
 and
 you
 panicked
 and
 sold,
 well,


you
 would
 have
 you
 would
 have
 lost


everything
 and
 then
 it
 it
 recovered.
 So,


it
 works
 both
 ways.
 That's
 why
 I
 said


earlier
 in
 our
 conversation,
 you
 you


have
 to
 stay
 invested
 so
 that
 the
 dip


doesn't
 matter.
 and
 if
 anything
 take


advantage
 of
 the
 dip
 and
 buy
 more.
 So


you
 own
 Amazon,
 you
 see
 it
 dip,
 you
 say,


"Well,
 I
 still
 believe
 in
 the
 company.
 I


still
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 company
 and
 it's


got
 a
 good
 future."
 Or
 then
 maybe
 you


buy
 some
 more
 in
 the
 dip
 and
 you
 do


still
 better.
 But
 the
 important
 thing
 is


you
 don't
 sell
 when
 it's
 down
 because


there's
 panic
 in
 the
 air.


>> And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 um
 this
 speaks
 to
 a


broader
 sentiment
 throughout
 this


conversation
 which
 is
 to
 do
 what
 others


don't
 do.
 You
 know,
 and
 Warren
 Buffett's


famous
 for
 saying
 be
 fearful
 when
 others


are
 greedy
 and
 greedy
 when
 others
 are


fearful.
 But
 generally
 the
 sentiment
 on


social
 media,
 especially
 for
 younger


generations
 and
 especially
 for
 men,


which
 is
 supported
 by
 the
 data,
 is
 that


the
 way
 to
 make
 money
 is
 by
 like
 trading


crypto
 or
 by
 right


>> I
 mean
 there's
 so
 many
 people
 that
 sell


this
 is
 such
 a
 we
 need
 to
 address
 this.


>> You
 know,
 it's
 a
 platform.


>> It's
 a
 gambling.
 It's
 just
 gambling.


>> It's
 it's
 a
 gambling
 platform.
 And
 so


that's
 going,
 you
 know,
 people
 sometimes


say
 to
 me,
 you
 know,
 I'd
 never
 invest
 in


the
 stock
 market.
 It's
 just
 gambling.
 I


say,
 well,
 you're
 half
 right.
 Our
 foam


[clears throat]
 is
 all
 dissipated.
 But


if
 there
 were
 still
 foam
 here,
 I
 would


say
 yes.
 If
 you're
 doing
 it
 short-term


and
 you're
 playing
 with
 the
 foam,


absolutely
 is
 no
 different
 than
 going
 to


Las
 Vegas.
 If
 you're
 investing
 for
 the


beer,
 it's
 an
 entirely
 different
 story.


And
 you're
 investing
 for
 the
 long
 term.


And
 there's
 lots
 of
 young
 people
 that


are
 being
 tempted
 into
 buying
 a
 course


that's
 going
 to
 help
 them
 learn
 how
 to


trade.


>> That's
 great
 for
 the
 people
 selling
 the


course.


>> There's
 such
 an
 there's
 such
 an


incredible
 like
 ir
 obvious
 irony
 to
 the


idea
 that
 I
 have
 some
 secret
 about


trading
 that's
 really
 going
 to
 make,
 you


know,
 that
 is
 capable
 of
 making
 one


wealthy,


>> right?


>> And
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 it
 to
 you


>> or
 even
 sell
 it
 to
 you.


>> Why
 would
 I
 need
 to
 if
 it
 worked,


>> right?
 Like
 this
 is
 such
 an
 obvious


question
 to
 me.
 Like
 why
 would
 I
 need
 to


sell
 it
 if
 it
 worked?


>> It
 it
 is
 the
 obvious
 question.
 I
 mean,


you
 know,


>> and
 I
 feel
 sorry.
 I
 have
 great
 empathy


because
 the
 people
 that
 buy
 these
 things


are
 people
 that
 are
 desperate
 to
 get
 out


of
 their
 financial
 situation
 and
 they


run
 out
 of
 options
 and
 so
 it's
 very


compelling
 to
 hear
 that
 there's
 some


secret
 that
 you
 can
 predict
 the
 stock


market.
 It's
 very
 compelling.


>> You
 know,
 in
 another
 interview
 I
 I
 said


one
 time
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 this


[clears throat]
 same
 line
 of


conversation
 we're
 having
 and
 I
 said,


you
 know,
 I
 blame
 my
 mother.
 I
 would
 be


a
 lot
 richer
 if
 she
 hadn't
 instilled
 a


conscience
 in
 me.
 You
 know,
 she's
 cost


me
 millions
 of
 dollars
 instilling
 this


conscience.
 I
 could
 have
 courses.
 I


could
 be,
 you
 know,


>> but
 no,
 I
 am
 saying
 that
 there
 is
 a
 path


that
 will
 give
 you
 great
 results


and
 it's
 a
 pretty
 well
 proven
 path
 at


this
 point.


So
 many

This
 is
 something
 that
 I've
 made
 for


you.
 I've
 realized
 that
 the
 DVO
 audience


are
 strivvers.
 Whether
 it's
 in
 business


or
 health,
 we
 all
 have
 big
 goals
 that
 we


want
 to
 accomplish.
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 I've
 learned
 is
 that
 when
 you
 aim


at
 the
 big
 big
 big
 goal,
 it
 can
 feel


incredibly
 psychologically
 uncomfortable


because
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 being
 stood
 at


the
 foot
 of
 Mount
 Everest
 and
 looking


upwards.
 The
 way
 to
 accomplish
 your


goals
 is
 by
 breaking
 them
 down
 into
 tiny


small
 steps.
 And
 we
 call
 this
 in
 our


team
 the
 1%.
 And
 actually
 this


philosophy
 is
 highly
 responsible
 for


much
 of
 our
 success
 here.
 So,
 what
 we've


done
 so
 that
 you
 at
 home
 can
 accomplish


any
 big
 goal
 that
 you
 have
 is
 we've
 made


these
 1%
 diaries
 and
 we
 released
 these


last
 year
 and
 they
 all
 sold
 out.
 So,
 I


asked
 my
 team
 over
 and
 over
 again
 to


bring
 the
 diaries
 back,
 but
 also
 to


introduce
 some
 new
 colors
 and
 to
 make


some
 minor
 tweaks
 to
 the
 diary.
 So,
 now


we
 have
 a
 better
 range
 for
 you.
 So,
 if


you
 have
 a
 big
 goal
 in
 mind
 and
 you
 need


a
 framework
 and
 a
 process
 and
 some


motivation,
 then
 I
 highly
 recommend
 you


get
 one
 of
 these
 diaries
 before
 they
 all


sell
 out
 once
 again.
 And
 you
 can
 get


yours
 now
 at
 the
 diary.com
 where
 you
 can

Do
 I
 need
 a
 financial
 adviser?


Cuz
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 out
 listening
 now


will
 be
 thinking,
 "Yeah,
 I
 will
 figure


out
 my
 money
 situation
 when
 I
 have


enough
 money
 to
 pay
 a
 financial


adviser."
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 uh
 my
 attitude


is
 by
 the
 time
 you
 know
 enough
 to
 choose


a
 good
 financial
 advisor,
 which
 is
 no


easy
 task,
 you
 probably
 know
 enough
 to


do
 it
 on
 your
 own,
 at least
 on
 the


investing
 part.
 Now,
 there
 are
 life


kinds
 of
 decisions
 where
 maybe
 advisors


would
 be
 more
 useful,
 but
 again,
 you


have
 to
 be
 careful
 and
 and
 it
 takes
 you


you
 need
 to
 really
 educate
 yourself
 as


to
 how
 advisers
 get
 paid.
 For
 instance,


my
 attitudes,
 by
 the
 way,
 are
 colored
 by


the
 fact
 that
 I
 I
 hear
 so
 frequently


from
 [clears throat]
 my
 followers
 about


bad
 experiences
 with
 financial
 advisors.


So,
 I
 have
 a
 negative
 opinion.
 To
 be


fair,
 I
 know
 there
 are
 good
 ones
 out


there,
 and
 all
 due
 respect
 to
 those
 good


ones,
 but
 let's
 suppose
 you
 have
 a


financial
 advisor
 who
 gets
 paid
 based
 on


the
 assets
 under
 management,
 right?


>> The
 amount
 of
 the
 amount
 that
 you've


given
 them.


>> Exactly.
 Right.
 So,
 maybe
 it's
 1%.
 So,


you
 give
 them
 a
 million
 dollars
 and
 they


get
 1%
 a
 year
 to
 manage
 that
 money
 for


for
 you.
 Let's
 suppose
 you
 go
 to
 that


advisor
 and
 you
 say,
 "You
 know,
 Stephen,


I've
 I've
 been
 thinking
 about
 paying
 off


my
 mortgage.
 I've
 got
 a
 half
 a
 million


dollar
 mortgage
 on
 this
 house.
 It's
 6%.


Let's
 say
 it's
 5%.
 So,
 in
 that
 middle


range,
 it's
 5%.
 I'm
 thinking
 about


paying
 it
 off.
 What
 do
 you
 think?"
 Okay.


Well,
 now
 Stephen
 has
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 dilemma


because


he
 can
 certainly
 give
 you
 the
 most


accurate
 financial
 advice
 he
 is
 capable


of
 giving
 you
 and
 answering
 that


question.


But
 if
 that
 leads
 him
 to
 say
 yes,
 pay


off
 the
 mortgage,


he
 has
 just
 reduced
 his
 income
 by
 half


because
 when
 you
 pay
 off
 that
 mortgage,


half
 a
 million
 dollars
 is
 going
 to
 go


out
 from
 his
 management
 and
 paying
 off


the
 mortgage
 company.
 So
 you
 have
 just


asked
 Steven
 to
 give
 you
 advice


potentially
 that
 is
 bad
 for
 Steven.
 Now


if
 Steven's
 a
 honorable,
 capable,


honest
 guy,
 then
 maybe
 Steven
 does
 that.


But
 let's
 suppose
 Stephen
 has
 two
 kids


in
 college.


Let's
 suppose
 Steven
 just
 bought
 a
 boat.


Let's
 suppose
 Steven
 is
 going
 through
 a


divorce.


Let's
 think
 about
 that.
 Maybe
 Steven,
 as


honest
 and
 capable
 and
 and
 decent
 as
 he


ordinarily
 is,
 has
 financial
 pressures


that
 might
 play
 a
 role,
 right?
 There
 is


a
 conflict
 of
 interest
 frequently.
 So,


you
 have
 to
 understand
 how
 your
 advisor


is
 being
 paid.


>> How
 does
 your
 portfolio
 look?
 Where
 have


you
 allocated
 your
 money
 in
 terms
 of


percentages?
 How
 much
 money
 do
 you
 have


in
 real
 estate
 versus
 cash
 versus
 index


funds?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 even
 think
 about
 about
 the


real
 estate.
 We
 have
 this
 cabin
 in


Wisconsin
 on
 the
 lake
 and
 then
 we
 have
 a


condo
 in
 Florida.
 Um,
 they're
 both
 very


modest,
 so
 pretty
 small
 part
 of
 our
 net


worth.
 I
 like
 to
 buy
 things
 from
 a


position
 of
 power.


My
 stocks,
 I'm
 probably
 about
 80%
 in
 in


VTSAX,
 total
 stock
 market
 index
 fund,


and
 probably
 15%
 in
 bonds,
 a
 total
 bond


market
 index
 fund,
 and
 then
 the
 other
 5%


in
 money
 market
 fund.
 I
 keep
 some
 money


in
 uh
 the
 checking
 account
 to
 pay
 the


bills.
 And
 to
 break
 it
 down
 a
 little


further
 for
 you,
 my
 wife
 and
 I
 both
 have


IAS.
 We
 have
 a
 regular
 IRA
 and
 a
 Roth


IRA.
 So
 there
 are
 four
 IAS.
 All
 four
 of


them
 hold
 VTSAX.
 We
 have
 taxable


accounts
 and
 part
 of
 that
 is
 VTSAX.
 Part


of
 it
 is
 the
 bonds.


>> What
 is
 a
 bond?


>> A
 bond
 is
 money
 that
 you
 have
 lent
 to
 a


company
 or
 to
 the
 government.
 So
 when


you
 buy
 a
 bond,
 you
 are
 essentially


lending
 money
 to
 a
 company
 or
 a


government
 entity.
 So
 they
 pay
 you


interest.
 So
 you
 will
 they
 companies
 and


the
 governments
 sell
 bonds
 of
 various


maturities.
 So
 they
 can
 be
 very
 short


like
 a
 money
 market
 fund
 is
 basically


very
 short-term
 bonds,
 you
 know,
 like
 30


days
 or
 less,
 right?
 Which
 makes
 it
 the


equivalent
 of
 cash.
 But
 you
 could
 buy
 a


a
 certificate
 of
 deposit
 is
 a
 kind
 of
 a


bond.
 So
 you
 could
 buy
 one
 of
 those
 for


3
 months
 or
 6
 months
 or
 a
 year,
 5
 years,


10
 years,
 buy
 US
 treasuries
 going
 out
 30


years.


>> Why
 would
 I
 do
 that
 instead
 of
 buying


the
 index
 fund?


>> So
 the
 index
 fund
 is
 stocks.
 It's
 it's


very
 stocks
 as
 we
 talked
 about
 big


growth
 engine,
 great
 long-term,
 very


volatile.
 [snorts]
 So
 if
 you
 want


something
 to
 smooth
 the
 ride,
 bonds
 are


not
 very
 good
 for
 long-term
 growth,
 but


they
 are
 not
 nearly
 as
 volatile.


>> Are
 they
 so
 they're
 safer?
 short-term,


yes,
 because
 they're
 less
 volatile.


Long-term,
 they
 tend
 to
 lose
 value
 to


inflation.


Stocks,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 are
 riskier


short-term
 because
 of
 the
 volatility,


but
 long-term
 they
 outpace
 inflation
 and


so
 they
 are
 safer
 long
 term.
 So,
 it


depends
 on
 your
 time
 horizon
 is
 which
 is


which
 is
 safer.
 But
 traditionally
 people


think
 of
 bonds
 as
 being
 safer
 and
 really


the
 way
 you
 should
 hear
 that
 is
 less


volatile
 and
 stocks
 being
 riskier.


You
 should
 hear
 that
 is
 more
 volatile.


>> So
 is
 it
 broadly
 true
 to
 say
 that
 if
 we


exclude
 your
 real
 estate
 70%
 of
 your


assets
 are
 in
 stocks,
 20%
 in
 bonds
 and


5%
 in
 cash?


>> Probably
 more
 80
 155.


>> 80%
 stocks,
 15
 bonds
 cash.
 Okay.
 It's


interesting
 because
 um


>> which
 would
 be
 considered
 very
 very


aggressive
 and
 I
 wouldn't
 necessarily


recommend
 that
 for
 most
 people
 my
 age.


>> I
 thought
 it
 would
 be
 curious
 cuz
 we
 now


have
 this
 new
 alien
 amongst
 us
 called


AI.
 I
 thought
 it
 would
 be
 curious
 if
 I


went
 on
 Chatt
 and
 I
 asked
 Chatt
 the


question.
 I'm
 a
 normal
 person
 who
 earns


$50,000
 a
 year.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 financially


free
 in
 the
 future.
 Give
 me
 a
 one-s


sentence
 answer
 based
 on
 all
 of
 the


wisdom
 in
 the
 world
 taken
 from
 every


expert
 in
 investing
 ever.


>> Why?
 I
 know
 what
 the
 right
 answer
 is.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 the
 answer.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 say?


>> Read
 the
 simple
 path
 of
 wealth.
 I
 don't


think
 that's
 what
 it's
 going
 to
 say,
 but


that's
 the
 right
 answer.


>> And
 the
 the
 simple
 path
 of
 wealth
 talks


about
 three
 principles,
 right?


>> Right.


>> What
 are
 those
 three?
 I'm
 going to
 check


it
 against
 what
 it
 says.


>> Avoid
 debt.


>> Yeah.


>> Live
 on
 less
 than
 you
 earn.
 Invest
 the


surplus.
 It
 said,
 "Focus
 on
 saving
 and


consistently
 invest
 in
 lowcost


broad-based
 index
 funds
 like
 the
 S&P
 500


while
 living
 below
 your
 means
 and


allowing
 compounding
 to
 work
 over
 time."


I
 then
 asked
 another
 question.
 How
 do
 I


earn
 more?


>> I
 should
 sue
 them
 for
 mining
 my
 book.


>> Yeah,
 they
 probably
 did.
 [laughter]


I
 said,
 "How
 do
 I
 earn
 more?"
 What
 do


you
 think?
 You
 know
 if
 you
 if
 you


thought
 if
 your
 daughter
 came
 to
 you
 and


said


>> earn
 more
 in
 a
 job
 or


>> I
 just
 asked
 a
 very
 broad
 question
 which


is
 I
 now
 and
 now
 how
 do
 I
 earn
 more
 was


my
 question.


>> I
 would
 say
 develop
 develop
 your
 skills.


>> Okay.


>> It
 said
 to
 earn
 more
 focus
 on
 developing


high
 demand
 skills.


>> Oh
 there
 you
 go.


>> Seek
 opportunities
 for
 career


advancement.
 Explore
 side
 hustles
 or


invest
 in
 assets
 that
 generate
 passive


income
 like
 real
 estate
 or
 dividends.


But
 I
 really
 think
 that
 you
 know
 I


really
 think
 there's
 a
 really
 important


part
 there
 about
 developing
 high
 demand


skills.


>> What
 are
 those
 going
 to
 be
 in
 the


future?


>> Yeah.


>> With
 AI
 because
 programming
 for
 instance


used
 to
 be
 a
 very
 high
 demand
 skill
 and


people
 said
 learn
 how
 to
 program.
 Yeah.


>> From
 what
 I
 understand
 in
 the
 age
 of
 AI.


Yeah.
 That's
 not
 so
 much.


>> I
 even
 think
 about
 my
 own
 life.
 At
 18


years
 old
 I
 started
 learning
 about


social
 media.
 I
 dropped
 out
 of


university
 doing
 my
 business
 management


degree
 after
 one
 lecture
 and
 I
 started


learning
 about
 social
 media
 because
 I


was
 building
 a
 business
 in
 social
 media


and
 technology
 and
 although
 that
 first


business
 failed
 I
 I
 was
 19
 years
 old
 in


201
 what
 14
 or
 something
 really


understood
 this
 thing
 called
 social


media
 which
 led
 me
 to
 spend
 a
 year
 as
 a


consultant
 flying
 around
 the
 world
 to


all
 these
 companies
 doing
 social
 media


one
 of
 those
 companies
 turned
 around
 and


said
 it's
 been
 so
 great
 could
 you
 turn


this
 into
 a
 company
 I
 said
 no
 I've
 been


through
 the
 founder
 PT
 of
 starting
 a
 3


months
 later
 I
 said
 yes
 turned
 into
 a


company
 called
 social
 chain
 and
 that


changed
 my
 entire
 life


>> that
 worked
 out
 well


>> high
 demand
 skill
 I
 had
 even
 though
 I


failed
 I
 had
 this
 high
 demand
 skill
 that


was
 honestly
 at
 the
 time
 paying
 me


£70,000
 a
 month


>> you
 probably
 had
 it
 because
 you
 went


through
 the
 process
 of
 failing


>> yes


>> failure
 is
 you
 know
 it
 used
 to
 be
 in


some
 cultures
 that
 if
 you
 failed
 once


that
 was
 it
 you
 were
 a
 pariah
 nobody


would
 even
 look
 at
 you
 anymore
 failure


in
 our
 culture
 is
 just
 a
 stepping
 stone


I've
 heard
 venture
 capitalists
 say
 they


won't
 even
 look
 at
 an
 entrepreneur
 to


fund
 if
 they
 haven't
 failed
 at
 least


once.


>> The
 advice
 I'd
 now
 give
 to
 my
 kids
 based


on
 that
 is
 I
 would
 ask
 if
 my
 kids
 came


to
 me
 and
 said,
 "Dad,
 what
 should
 I
 go


learn?"
 I
 would
 say


go
 and
 work
 for
 a
 startup.
 I
 said


startup
 because
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 very


close
 to
 the
 CEO
 and
 founder
 because


there's
 going
 to
 be
 less
 desks.
 So,


you're
 going to
 be
 closer
 to
 the


proximity.
 That
 is
 failing
 at
 the


cutting
 edge.
 So
 if
 it's
 AI,
 I'd
 say
 go


work
 for
 an
 AI
 startup.
 I
 I
 probably
 not


going
 to
 work
 out.
 You're
 probably
 going


to
 be
 the
 company
 will
 be
 bust
 in
 a


couple
 of
 months
 time,
 but
 you're
 going


to
 be
 so
 close
 to
 the
 failure.


>> You
 will
 learn
 so
 much.


>> Yes.


>> I
 wish
 somebody
 had
 given
 me
 that


advice.


>> And
 that's
 that's
 like
 in
 a
 way
 I
 guess


roundabout
 way.
 What
 I
 did
 is
 I
 started


a
 company
 that
 failed
 at
 the
 very


forefront
 of
 a
 wave
 coming
 into
 shore,


which
 meant
 that
 as
 I
 hit,
 you
 know,
 as


the
 wave
 crashed
 down
 and
 I
 was
 left


there
 on
 my
 surfboard,
 I
 now
 had
 this


high
 demand
 set
 of
 skills
 that
 people


were
 like
 begging
 me
 for,
 which
 set


myself
 up.
 And
 frankly,

Is
 there
 a

 story
 in
 this
 book


of
 yours?


>> Well,
 there's
 so
 many
 great
 ones.
 So,


>> share
 some.


>> I
 already
 I
 already
 alluded
 to
 my


favorite
 one,
 which
 is
 my
 friend
 Tom.


You
 know,
 because
 he
 has
 I
 mean,
 Tom
 was


a
 guy
 who
 got
 to
 the
 age
 of
 62.
 He'd


been
 through
 multiple
 divorces.
 He
 lost


his
 house
 to
 foreclosure.
 He
 lost
 his


job.
 He
 was
 broke.
 He
 went
 bankrupt.
 And


yet,
 his
 life
 has
 turned
 out
 pretty


well.
 He's
 an
 extraordinarily
 happy
 guy.


That's
 my
 favorite
 story.
 But
 the
 one
 of


the
 reasons
 I
 like
 this
 book
 so
 much
 and


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 candidly
 I
 did
 it
 is


if
 you
 read
 through
 it,
 you
 will
 find


there
 are
 some
 stories
 from
 people
 who


were
 tech
 bros,
 right,
 who
 made
 big


incomes
 and
 they
 read
 the
 simple
 path
 to


wealth
 and
 applied
 and
 it
 worked
 very


well
 for
 them.
 But
 there
 are
 many,
 many


more
 stories
 of
 people
 who
 have


accomplished
 this
 from
 much
 more
 humble


beginnings.
 Give
 me
 an
 example
 of


>> I
 have
 a
 very
 good
 friend
 of
 mine,
 high


school
 buddy.
 I
 don't
 think
 he's
 ever


made
 more
 than
 $40,000
 a
 year.
 He
 is


financially
 independent
 because
 he


followed
 the
 basic
 principles
 that
 I


talk
 about
 in
 that
 book.
 I
 have
 a


different
 friend
 and
 he
 was
 in
 the


financial
 business.
 He
 was
 living
 in


Chicago
 and
 over
 lunch
 he
 told
 me
 that


his
 Christmas
 bonus
 had
 come
 in
 at


$800,000.


That's
 back
 in
 the
 mid
 '90s
 when
 that


was
 real
 money,
 right?


And
 he
 was
 already
 making,
 I
 don't
 know,


a
 million
 dollars
 a
 year
 or
 whatever
 it


was,
 big
 income.
 And
 he
 was
 broke.


And
 you
 see,
 most
 people
 listening
 this


thing,
 I
 said, "What
 are
 you
 talking


about?
 This
 guy
 got
 a
 bonus
 for
 8.


People
 paid
 me
 $800,000
 for a
 year.
 I'd


be
 done
 forever,
 right?
 And
 that'd
 be
 my


nut.
 I'm
 good.
 How
 can
 he
 be
 broke?"


Well,
 when
 you
 listen
 to
 him
 talk
 about


the
 house,
 the
 cars,
 the
 schools,
 and


you
 start
 doing
 the
 math,
 you
 realize


that
 no,
 his
 income
 is
 not
 enough.
 He's


barely
 barely
 making
 it.
 So,
 here's
 a


guy
 with
 a
 big
 income
 who
 is,
 unless
 he


changes
 his
 ways,
 is
 never
 going
 to
 be


financially
 independent.
 Financially


independent.
 Here's
 my
 guy
 with
 a
 tiny


income
 comparatively
 who
 got
 there.
 I've


come
 to
 believe
 that
 a
 large
 income


actually
 can
 be
 an
 impediment
 to


accomplishing
 it.
 And
 my
 reasoning
 for


this
 is
 that
 I
 think
 people
 who
 have
 a


large
 income
 are
 much
 more
 likely
 to
 be


drawn
 into
 the
 competing
 with
 the


Joneses
 scenario
 because
 they
 associate


with
 other
 people
 have
 large
 incomes
 and


they're
 all
 driving
 a
 certain
 car,


living
 in
 a
 certain
 neighborhood,


sending
 their
 kids
 to
 certain
 schools


and
 that
 probably
 becomes
 very
 hard
 to


disengage
 with
 and
 making
 it
 perhaps


even
 less
 likely
 that
 they
 are
 going
 to


decide
 to
 spend
 a
 large
 portion
 of
 their


income
 on
 buying
 their
 freedom.
 Whereas


the
 people
 who
 make
 less
 money
 probably


don't
 have
 those
 same
 social
 pressures


and
 are
 more
 readily
 able
 to
 do
 it.


So
 starting
 from
 humble
 beginnings
 is
 no


obstacle
 and
 that's
 was
 the
 point
 of


doing
 Pathfinders.


>> Interesting.


>> It
 does
 track
 that.
 I
 think
 the


goalposts
 continue
 to
 move
 in
 different


ways
 and


>> yeah,


>> I
 guess
 you
 go
 from
 competing
 to
 the


Joneses
 to
 competing
 with
 the
 size
 of


someone
 else's
 yacht,
 which
 is
 all


slippery
 slopes
 to
 bad
 places


>> or
 your
 own
 or
 your
 own
 demons


as
 we
 talked
 about
 earlier,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 You
 mentioned
 a
 word
 in
 there
 as


well.
 You
 mentioned
 I
 think
 you
 were


talking
 about
 your
 friend
 Tom.
 Tom
 had
 a


divorce.


>> Multiple
 divorces.
 Yeah.


>> I


>> which
 is
 bad
 for
 [clears throat]
 your


wealth.


>> Yeah.
 I
 didn't
 real
 I
 didn't
 I
 didn't


realize
 this
 cuz
 I've
 never
 been
 through


one
 before.
 Um
 I
 spoke
 to
 James
 Ston
 on


the
 show
 who's
 a
 divorce
 lawyer
 who
 kind


of
 opened
 my
 eyes
 to
 it.
 But
 actually
 I


had
 a
 private
 conversation
 with
 a
 friend


here
 in
 New
 York
 City,
 I'd
 say
 a
 couple


of
 months
 ago
 who's
 going
 through
 a


divorce
 and
 he
 he
 sat
 me
 down
 and
 he


talked
 me
 through
 the
 specific


consequences
 of
 of
 divorce
 that
 he's


going
 through.


>> He
 said
 to
 me,
 he's
 a
 very
 successful


person.
 I
 reckon
 he's
 probably
 worth
 500


million,
 right?
 He
 said
 the
 divorce


proceedings
 have
 now
 dragged
 on
 for
 five


or
 6
 years.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 having
 to
 go
 and


see
 lawyers
 all
 the
 time.
 And
 he
 said
 to


me
 as
 well
 that
 he
 is
 paying
 for
 her


lawyer
 which
 I
 was
 I
 didn't
 really


understand.
 But
 he
 was
 like
 no
 I
 have
 to


also
 cover
 her
 lawyer
 costs
 because
 you


know
 I'm
 the
 the
 bread
 winner
 so
 she


doesn't
 have
 money
 so
 I'm
 covering
 her


lawyer
 costs
 which
 is
 what
 I
 have
 to
 do.


And
 he
 said
 the
 law
 firm
 have
 gone
 from


being
 a
 very
 very
 small
 practice
 in


those
 six
 years.
 Now
 they
 have
 a
 massive


building
 and
 he
 goes,
 "I
 know
 it's
 my


money.
 I
 bought
 it.
 I
 [laughter]
 bought


it."


>> He
 literally
 is
 like,
 "I
 have
 paid
 for


her
 lawyer
 and
 now
 they're
 doing
 really


really
 well
 and
 they're
 milking
 this


this
 case.
 They're
 drawing
 it
 out


because
 they
 have
 no
 incentive
 to
 this


to
 this
 ending."
 Yeah.


>> So
 he's
 like,
 "I've
 spent
 tens
 of


millions
 on
 her
 lawyer
 who
 is
 basically


dragging
 me.
 Um,
 and
 now
 they've
 got


this
 massive
 building."
 What
 else
 did
 he


say
 to
 me?
 He
 said,
 "Because
 some
 of
 my


assets
 are
 subjective
 in
 value,
 like
 my


company,
 her
 lawyer
 [laughter]
 is


inflating
 the
 price
 of
 my
 assets
 because


she's
 going
 to
 get
 half
 of
 whatever
 they


can
 convince
 a
 judge
 my
 assets
 are


worth."
 So
 he,
 you
 know,
 for
 example,


his
 business
 might
 be
 worth
 100
 million,


but
 the
 lawyer
 is
 making
 the
 case
 to
 the


judge
 that
 it's
 worth
 500
 million
 so


that
 she
 gets
 250
 million.
 He
 also
 said


to
 me,


>> which
 really
 isn't
 there,


>> which
 really
 he
 doesn't
 have,
 right?
 And


then
 he
 was
 saying
 to
 me,
 he
 goes,
 you


know,
 I
 bought
 this
 particular
 stock.


>> So
 he
 is,
 I'm
 sorry
 to
 interrupt
 you,


but
 now
 he's
 forced
 to
 fight
 it.


>> He's
 fighting.


>> It's
 not
 like
 he
 could
 just
 say,
 okay,


she
 can
 have
 half.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 this
 is
 a
 judgment


that
 is
 going
 to
 create
 a
 a
 an


obligation
 on
 his
 part
 for
 assets
 that


don't
 actually
 exist.


>> So
 it's
 more
 than
 half.


>> She
 could
 end
 up
 taking
 60
 70.
 And
 the


other
 thing
 he
 said
 to
 me,
 which
 was


quite
 sad,
 he
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 I
 was


one
 of the
 f
 He
 was
 one
 of
 the
 early


investors
 in
 a
 big
 company
 that
 we
 all


know.
 and
 um
 he
 said
 to
 me,
 I
 bought


that
 stock
 15
 20
 years
 ago.
 It's


actually
 quite
 emotional
 to
 him
 that
 he


was
 so
 early
 in
 back
 in
 the
 company
 and


now
 he's
 forced
 to
 sell
 that.
 So
 he
 has


to
 liquidate
 investments
 he
 made
 20


years
 ago
 because
 again
 she's
 entitled


to
 half


>> and
 that'll
 be
 a
 huge
 tax
 hit.


>> A
 huge
 tax
 hit,


>> right?
 And
 I
 think
 some
 people
 don't


realize
 that
 wealthy
 people
 can


get
 a
 loan
 against
 that
 stock
 without


ever
 having
 to
 sell
 it.


>> So
 he's
 probably,
 if
 he's
 wrong,
 he's


probably
 got
 a
 big
 loan
 against
 that


stock,


>> right?


>> Probably
 a
 50%
 loan.
 So,
 just
 for
 anyone


that
 doesn't
 understand
 this,
 because
 I


only
 understood
 this
 in
 the
 last
 couple


years
 where
 where
 I
 started
 doing


similar
 things,
 is
 if
 the
 stock
 is
 worth


a h
 100red
 million,
 he
 can
 get
 50


million
 tax-free
 from
 a
 bank
 just
 by


keeping
 that
 stock
 there
 and
 really


never
 have
 to
 pay
 it
 back
 because
 it's


such
 a
 great
 stock.
 Um,
 and
 it
 was
 also


just
 looking
 in
 his
 face
 and
 just
 seeing


the
 stress
 and
 the
 toll
 of
 having
 to
 go


to
 court
 all
 the
 time
 and
 fight
 this


thing
 for
 six
 or
 seven
 years
 that
 I


thought,
 wow,
 we
 we
 give
 people


financial
 advice
 all
 the
 time
 about
 the


best
 stocks
 to
 pick
 or
 invest
 in
 index


funds.
 We
 don't
 talk
 enough
 about
 the


how
 divorce
 can
 just
 destroy
 your
 life.


>> You
 know,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 so
 careful
 in


choosing
 your
 spouse.
 I've
 had
 push
 back


on
 that
 and
 people
 say,
 "Well,
 then


you're
 choosing
 your
 spouse
 is
 not
 a


financial
 decision.
 It's,
 you
 know,
 it's


emotional,
 it's
 romantic,
 it's
 well,


yeah,
 it's
 all
 those
 things,
 but
 it
 you


better
 take
 finance
 into
 account
 for
 all


the
 reasons
 that
 we're
 discussing."
 This


also,
 by
 the
 way,
 loops
 us
 back
 to
 an


earlier
 part
 of
 our
 conversation
 where


does
 money
 buy
 happiness?
 Does,
 you


know,
 being
 richer,


is
 that
 always
 necessarily
 better?
 Well,


this
 guy
 is
 more
 of
 a
 target
 because
 of


his
 wealth
 than
 he
 would
 be
 if
 he
 were.


So,
 is
 his
 money
 really
 making
 him


happier
 at
 this
 point
 in
 his
 life?
 Yeah,


probably
 not
 so
 much,
 you
 know.


>> You
 know,
 and
 he's
 he's
 going to
 be
 fine


either
 way,
 like
 sure,
 you
 know,
 um


which
 is
 a
 point
 worth
 saying
 of
 nuance,


but
 also
 and
 the
 other
 point
 of
 nuance


worth
 saying
 is
 that


>> he's
 going
 to
 be
 fine
 financially,
 but


emotionally
 it's
 he's
 still
 going
 to
 go


and
 she's
 probably
 going
 through
 it
 too


on
 the
 other
 side.


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]
 And
 the
 other
 point
 of


nuance
 here
 is
 that
 she
 did
 raise
 the


four
 or
 five
 the
 the
 three
 or
 four
 kids


>> while
 he
 was
 off
 building
 the
 business


for,
 you
 know,
 20
 odd
 years.
 So,
 one


could
 argue
 that
 he
 wouldn't
 have
 that


wealth
 without
 her
 being
 at
 home
 to
 look


after
 the
 kids
 and
 she'd
 made
 huge


sacrifices
 to
 her
 own
 career,


>> right?


>> So,
 you
 know,
 there's
 balance.
 But
 I
 I


just
 think
 with
 um


James
 Ston
 said
 to
 me,
 even
 if
 you
 don't


get
 a
 prenup,


there's
 still
 a
 prenup.
 You
 either
 use


the
 government's
 prenup,


>> which
 is


>> or
 you
 create
 your
 own,


>> or
 you
 create
 your
 own.
 Either
 way,


there's
 a
 prenup.


>> Absolutely.


>> Do
 you
 want
 to
 let
 some
 judge
 decide


>> or
 do
 you
 want
 to
 be
 intentional
 before


you
 get
 married
 with
 your
 partner
 about


how
 things
 will
 be
 split?


>> And
 even
 when
 I
 think
 about
 my
 partner


at
 the
 moment,
 and
 we're
 probably
 going


to
 get
 married
 soon.


>> Congratulations.


>> Thank
 you.
 I
 haven't
 proposed
 just
 yet,


but
 I'm
 working
 on
 it.
 Don't
 tell
 her


that.


>> We
 We
 just
 let
 the
 secret
 out.


>> She
 doesn't
 She
 doesn't
 WATCH
 THIS


ANYWAY.
 [laughter]


>> Someone's
 going
 to
 do


>> Wait
 a
 second.
 But
 I'm
 on
 this
 time,
 so


this
 is
 the
 one
 episode
 she's
 going
 to


watch.


>> True.


>> Well,
 I'm
 very
 fortunate
 as
 if
 this


spring
 I
 will
 have
 been
 m
 married
 44


years.


>> Damn.


>> And
 [clears throat]
 I
 I
 tell
 people
 I
 I


married
 my
 wife
 out
 of
 the
 gate.
 Why


wait?
 Do
 you
 have
 a
 framework
 for


choosing
 the
 person
 or
 for
 sustaining


for
 44
 years?
 Cuz
 I'm
 what,
 six,
 seven


years
 in
 with
 my
 girlfriend,
 but
 you
 got


44
 years
 in.


>> Funny
 story
 about
 that
 is
 people
 used
 to


ask
 me,
 did
 you
 and
 Jane
 sit
 down
 and


discuss
 money
 before
 make
 sure
 you
 were


on
 the
 same
 page
 financially
 before
 you


got
 married?
 [snorts]
 And
 I
 always
 used


to
 say,
 you
 know,
 it's
 a
 great
 idea.
 You


should
 do
 that.
 But
 no,
 we
 never
 did


that.
 I
 just
 I
 just
 got
 lucky.
 you
 know,


we
 never
 talked
 about
 it,
 but
 as
 it


happens,
 we
 got
 married
 and
 we
 were


very,
 very
 compatible
 financially,
 which


we
 are,
 but
 just
 got
 lucky.
 Well,
 I
 told


that
 story
 in
 front
 of
 her
 one
 time
 and


she
 leaned
 back
 in
 her
 chair
 and
 she


said,
 "What
 are
 you
 talking
 about?
 On


our
 first
 date,
 you
 said
 to
 me,
 you
 need


to
 be
 saving
 50%
 of
 your
 income."
 You


said, "What
 do
 you
 mean
 we
 never
 talked


about
 money?"


I
 guess
 that's
 such
 a
 natural
 part
 of
 my


persona.
 I
 didn't
 even
 remember
 doing


it.


>> Interesting.
 [laughter]


[snorts]


>> My
 last
 question
 for
 you
 is
 about


regret.


You
 said
 you're
 75.


>> I
 am.


>> What
 are
 your
 biggest
 regrets?


>> So,
 I
 I
 think
 regrets
 are
 are
 tricky
 and


and
 I
 will
 I'll
 answer
 your
 question


directly
 and
 it's
 a
 couple
 of
 things


that
 or
 at least
 one
 thing
 that
 occurs


to
 me
 that
 might
 be
 surprising.


The
 reason
 they're
 tricky
 is
 because


there
 is
 an
 assumption
 like
 you
 re
 you


regret
 doing
 A
 and
 you
 think
 if
 only
 I'd


done
 B,
 things
 would
 be
 better.
 But
 you


don't
 know
 that
 that's
 true.
 But
 you


might
 say,
 "Boy,
 I
 regret
 starting
 that


company
 that
 failed
 because
 it
 was
 a


failure."
 Well,
 yeah,
 but
 it
 led
 to


something
 much
 bigger.
 You
 learned
 so


much.
 Now
 maybe
 if
 you'd
 said
 instead
 of


starting
 that
 company
 that
 failed,
 maybe


I
 took
 this
 highpaying
 job
 and
 and
 I


worked
 my
 way
 up
 through
 the
 corporate


organization.
 And
 you'd
 be
 saying
 there,


you
 know,
 you'd
 be
 sitting
 at
 some
 high


executive
 level
 in
 this
 corporation
 and


looking
 back
 and
 saying,
 "Wow,
 am
 I
 glad


I
 didn't
 do
 that
 startup
 that
 failed,


right?"
 And
 yet
 you're
 so
 much
 further


ahead
 now
 than
 if
 you
 So
 who
 knows?
 Who


knows
 what
 choice
 you
 made
 that
 appears


to
 be
 the
 wrong
 choice
 as
 to
 whether
 it


really
 was.
 Maybe
 it
 was
 exactly
 right.


Maybe
 things
 would
 have
 turned
 out


better,
 maybe
 they
 wouldn't.
 So,
 I'm


very
 hesitant
 to
 look
 back
 on.
 There
 are


many
 things
 I
 can
 look
 back
 on
 and
 say,


"Gee,
 I
 do
 wonder
 what
 if
 I'd
 gone
 down


the
 right
 path
 instead
 of
 the
 left
 path.


What
 would
 that
 have
 looked
 like?"
 But


there's
 no
 guarantees
 it
 would
 look


better
 and
 my
 life
 has
 been
 pretty
 damn


good.
 So,
 in
 that
 sense,
 I
 have
 no


regrets.


Two
 regrets
 I
 do
 have,
 very
 personal


regrets.
 I
 don't
 I've
 never
 shared
 these


publicly.


When
 I
 was
 a
 kid,


my
 father
 was
 a
 very
 handy
 guy.
 He
 loved


building
 things,
 working
 on
 the
 house,


that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


I
 was
 not
 that
 kind
 of
 kid.
 And
 I
 don't


know,
 I
 was
 eight
 or
 10
 years
 old
 at
 one


point.
 And
 for
 my
 birthday
 or
 Christmas,


I
 don't
 remember,
 he
 brought
 me
 a
 bought


me
 a
 jigsaw,
 which
 is
 a
 for
 people
 who


don't
 know,
 it's
 a
 it's
 an
 electric
 saw.


It's
 got
 a
 little
 blade.
 It
 goes
 up
 and


allows
 you
 to
 cut
 wood
 and
 very
 fine


kinds
 of
 patterns.


Last
 thing
 in
 the
 world
 this
 kid
 wanted.


And
 I
 let
 my
 dad
 know
 and
 he
 was
 crushed


because
 for
 him


it
 was
 the
 best
 gift
 he
 could
 possibly


think
 of
 to
 give
 to
 an
 eight
 or


10year-old
 or
 whatever
 it
 was.
 And
 so


one
 of
 the
 regrets
 and
 I
 give
 myself


some
 grace
 cuz
 I
 was
 very
 young
 and


reasonably
 you
 could
 expect
 that
 I


didn't
 have
 the
 maturity
 to
 deal
 with
 it


the
 way
 I
 would.
 But
 I
 I
 do
 regret


because
 I
 could
 see
 the
 pain
 in
 his
 face


when
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 rejected
 that
 gift,


right?


And
 maybe
 that
 taught
 me
 a
 good
 lesson


in
 being
 more
 empathetic
 going
 forward.


So
 again,
 do
 I
 really
 regret
 it?
 Well,
 I


regret
 that
 I
 hurt
 my
 father,
 but
 I


learned
 something
 pretty
 valuable.


>> And
 you've
 let
 you've
 remembered
 that


for
 70
 years.


>> I've
 remembered
 that
 for
 70
 years.
 Yeah.


Yeah.
 I've
 got
 similar
 stories
 of
 things


ways
 I
 reacted
 as
 a
 kid.


>> I
 think
 most
 people
 do.


>> You
 know,
 yeah,
 it
 sucks.


>> And
 then
 my
 second
 one,
 and
 this
 is
 even


bigger.
 [clears throat]
 I
 was
 24
 when
 my


dad
 died


and
 he
 died
 of
 emphyma


and
 [clears throat]


slow
 lingering
 death.
 He
 died
 in
 the


hospital.


And


the
 night
 before
 he
 died,
 the
 day
 before


he
 died,
 I
 was
 visiting
 him
 and
 um
 he


was
 sitting
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 the
 bed


and
 he
 said
 to
 me,
 "Uh,


I'm
 going
 to
 die
 now.


You
 know,
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to
 die
 tonight."


Turns
 out,
 of
 course,
 he
 was
 right.
 He


did.
 That
 was
 the
 night
 he
 died.


And
 instead
 of
 recognizing
 that


this
 was
 a
 moment
 where


he
 wanted
 to
 talk
 to
 his
 son
 about
 this


this
 probably
 the
 most
 momentous
 event


that
 any
 of
 us
 will
 ever
 face.


Right?
 Instead
 of
 recognizing
 that,


I
 went
 to
 the
 typical
 trope
 of,
 "Oh,


dad,
 don't
 don't
 talk
 like
 that.
 You


you're
 not
 going
 to
 die.
 you
 got
 a
 long


way
 to
 go.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 fine.
 I


went
 to
 all
 that
 [ __ ]


instead
 of
 just
 recognizing
 whether
 he


was
 right
 or
 wrong


[clears throat]
 that


he
 was
 facing
 a
 momentous
 thing
 and


[snorts and clears throat]
 he
 didn't


want
 to
 hear


don't
 don't
 think
 about
 that
 think
 more


positively.
 He
 he
 wanted
 to
 share
 with


his
 son


what
 he
 was
 facing.


And
 I
 regret
 that
 I
 wasn't
 there
 for
 him


in
 that
 moment.


But
 I
 regret
 that
 I
 didn't
 get
 to


experience
 that
 with
 him
 in
 that
 moment.


So
 that's
 my
 biggest.


>> I
 can
 still
 see
 it
 still
 in
 your
 face.


That
 was
 50
 years
 ago.


>> Is
 there
 a
 reason
 why
 you
 think
 in
 that


moment
 you
 didn't


want
 to
 go
 in
 that
 direction
 with
 him?


>> Was
 it
 a
 matter
 of
 what
 I
 wanted?
 Cuz


it's
 not
 like
 I
 considered


[clears throat]


I
 can
 either
 blow
 it
 off,
 which
 is
 what


I
 did,
 or
 embrace
 it
 and
 go
 there
 with


him.
 I
 I
 didn't
 even
 think
 that
 way.


It's
 not
 like


it's
 not
 like
 I
 made
 the
 wrong
 choice.
 I


wasn't
 mature
 enough
 to
 recognize
 there


was
 a
 choice.
 I
 wasn't
 mature
 enough
 to


recognize


the
 real
 dynamic
 of
 what
 was
 happening.


>> And
 for
 that
 you
 deserve
 grace.


>> Thank
 you.
 And
 I
 agree
 with
 that.
 But
 I


still
 regret
 it
 because
 how
 much
 better


for
 both
 of
 us
 would
 it
 have
 been


if
 I
 had
 recognized
 it?
 JL,
 we
 have a


closing
 tradition
 on
 this
 podcast
 where


the
 last
 guest
 leaves
 a
 question
 for
 the


next.


>> What
 is
 something
 that
 you
 think
 is
 true


that
 you
 haven't
 yet
 been
 able
 to


validate?
 I
 think
 at
 at
 this
 point
 in
 my


life,
 I'm
 I
 feel
 pretty
 comfortable


about
 what
 I
 think
 is
 true.
 Right?
 So,


I'm
 not
 sure
 this
 answers
 the
 question,


but
 uh


but
 a
 good
 example
 is
 I
 am
 pretty
 sure


that
 there
 is
 no
 afterlife,


right?
 I
 I
 have
 a
 high
 degree
 of


confidence
 to
 that.
 But
 of
 course,
 as


the
 song
 once
 said,
 we
 never
 know
 by


living
 and
 only
 our
 dying
 will
 tell.
 And


I
 am
 very
 curious
 about
 death.
 I
 am
 very


curious
 as
 to


what
 is
 on
 the
 other
 side,
 if
 anything.


So,
 in
 a
 perverse
 way,
 I
 guess
 I'm
 I
 am


looking
 forward
 to
 my
 death,
 right?
 I
 I


don't
 want
 to
 get
 there
 too
 soon.
 I


mean,
 I'm
 as
 long
 as
 I'm
 mentally
 and


physically
 capable,
 I'm
 happy
 to


continue
 living.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


But
 I
 do
 have
 a
 great
 curiosity
 about


death,
 and
 I'm
 almost
 100%
 sure
 that


when
 I'm
 dead,
 that's
 just
 it.
 It's


over.


But
 I'm
 curious,
 and
 it'll
 be


interesting
 if
 I
 die,
 and
 it's
 like,


whoops.
 You
 know,
 it's
 like,
 oh,
 there


is
 a
 guy
 with
 a
 white
 beard
 and


okay,
 I'll
 just
 show
 myself
 out.
 Thank


you
 very
 much.


>> [laughter]


>> There
 was
 one
 last
 question
 I
 wanted
 to


ask
 you
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 just
 about
 the


subject
 of
 happiness.
 Again
 at
 75
 years


old
 you
 have
 a
 retrospective
 clarity


that
 I
 don't
 yet
 have
 on
 what
 actually


mattered.


What
 actually
 matters?


>> Nothing.


Nothing
 really
 matters
 ultimately.


>> Nothing.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think


that's
 kind
 of
 like
 asking
 what's
 the


meaning
 of
 life,
 right?


And
 I
 don't
 think
 there
 is
 a
 meaning
 to


life
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 scale
 of
 the


universe,
 the
 scale
 of
 the
 cosmos.


The
 concept
 that


we
 as
 individuals
 bear
 some
 meaning


seems
 to
 me
 to
 be
 silly.
 Human
 beings


have
 been
 around
 for
 I
 don't know
 two


300,000
 years
 depending
 on
 when
 you


define
 homo
 sapiens.
 I
 mean
 that's


that's
 a
 infantestibly
 small
 smudge
 of


time


in
 that
 has
 happened
 already
 and
 that


will
 happen
 in
 the
 future
 even
 if
 humans


last
 for
 another
 few
 million
 years.
 It


will
 be
 an
 infinitely


tiny
 bit
 of
 time
 against
 this
 huge


cosmic
 universe
 and
 our
 individuality


within
 that
 is
 infantessimally
 small
 and


I
 think
 there's
 some
 great
 meaning


behind
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 to
 be
 the
 height


of
 arrogance.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 if
 you
 go


through
 life
 and
 you
 treat
 people
 pretty


well
 and
 you
 have
 a
 a
 pretty
 good
 good


run
 of
 it,
 I
 think
 you've
 done
 well.
 I


don't
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 there's


something
 profound
 in
 that.


>> So
 So
 what
 is
 the
 point
 then?
 Is
 there
 a


point?
 Is
 that
 the
 real
 question?


>> There
 is
 no
 point.
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 point


is
 we
 happen
 to
 be
 here
 and
 it
 can
 be
 a


good
 fun
 ride.
 It
 can
 be
 a
 very


difficult
 ride
 depending
 on
 what
 you


make
 of
 it
 and
 in
 some
 cases
 depending


on
 your
 circumstances.
 There
 have


certainly
 been
 people
 in
 history
 that


have
 born
 been
 born
 into
 circumstances


that


you
 know
 made
 it
 a
 a
 miserable
 existence


with
 no
 options
 out
 of
 it.
 I
 mean
 what's


the
 meaning
 of
 that?
 You
 know,
 you
 and
 I


and
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 people


listening
 to
 us,
 probably
 I
 venture
 to


say
 100%
 of
 them
 have
 a
 lot
 more


autonomy
 over
 over
 how
 we
 can
 make
 our


life.
 And


will
 it
 have
 great
 meaning?
 No,


ultimately
 not.
 But
 it's
 the
 only
 life


you
 have
 and
 you
 may
 as
 well
 make
 the


best
 of
 it.


>> I
 actually
 listened
 to
 something
 last


night
 by
 a
 guy
 called
 Lucas
 Jones
 who
 is


an
 actor.
 Um,
 he
 has
 some
 great
 books.


He's
 also
 a
 poet
 as
 far
 as
 I'm
 aware.


I'll
 link
 his
 books
 below.
 Um,
 but
 he
 he


made
 wrote
 this
 poem
 which
 I
 thought
 was


quite
 related
 to
 that
 that
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 play
 for
 you
 cuz
 I
 think
 it's


kind
 of
 captures
 the
 essence
 as
 well
 of


what
 you're
 saying.


>> He
 starts
 by
 saying,
 "I
 saw
 God
 on
 the


train."


>> Okay.


>> Saw
 God
 on
 the
 train.


>> A
 pretended
 I
 didn't.
 So,
 I
 sat
 far
 away


from
 the
 seat
 he
 was
 sitting
 in.
 And


then
 he
 got
 up,
 I
 think
 probably
 to
 piss


and
 he
 noticed
 me
 there
 and
 said,
 "All


right,
 what's
 this?
 What
 are
 you
 saying?


You
 hiding
 from
 me?"
 I
 said,
 "Ah,
 mate,


nah,
 just
 a
 comfy
 seat."
 And
 he
 looked


at
 me
 like
 I
 was
 a
 kid
 covered
 in


chocolate
 surrounded
 by
 rappers
 saying,


"Don't
 know
 what
 happened."
 And
 he
 go,


"It's
 coming
 then,
 mate.
 I've
 got
 a
 few


minutes.
 Tell
 me
 what's
 wrong,
 but
 don't


[ __ ]
 around
 with
 it."
 And
 it
 shocked
 me


then
 that
 it
 fit
 in
 one
 sentence.
 I


said,
 "Just
 think
 heaven's
 a
 stupid


incentive."
 Like
 what
 a
 [ __ ]
 life
 for
 a


beautiful
 death.
 And
 those
 who
 are
 evil


can
 suddenly
 repent
 like
 a
 killer
 or
 not


can
 live
 like
 a
 monster.
 Then
 right
 at


the
 end
 say,
 "I'm
 sorry,
 dear
 God,
 sir."


And
 end
 up
 in
 heaven
 right
 there
 with
 my


nana.
 She's
 doing
 some
 knitting.
 He's


waving
 a
 hammer.
 He's
 like,
 "Jesus
 god,


what
 a
 horrible
 deal."
 And
 he
 goes,


"Yeah,
 it's
 [ __ ]
 I
 know
 how
 you


feel."
 I'm
 like,
 "Mate,
 you're
 the
 one


spinning
 the
 wheel."
 And
 he
 goes,


"Listen,
 I'll
 tell
 you
 a
 secret."
 All


that
 stuff,
 mate.
 I
 didn't
 speak
 it.


Like
 the
 old
 joke
 says
 about
 liars
 and


men.
 If
 God
 wrote
 the
 book,
 why
 are
 you


holding
 the
 pen?
 Now,
 the
 rules
 I
 wrote,


I
 wrote
 on
 your
 heart.
 Truth
 I
 spoke,


you've
 known
 from
 the
 start,
 be
 kind,


don't
 harm,
 isn't
 that
 hard.
 Heaven
 is


just
 life
 if
 you're
 doing
 your
 part.
 You


want
 white
 clouds
 and
 endless
 skies.
 Uh,


yeah.
 Look
 around.
 You
 don't
 have
 to


die.
 I
 know
 it
 probably
 brings
 you
 some


pain
 to
 think
 of
 the
 dead
 as
 just
 dust


in
 a
 grave.
 But
 humans
 can't
 comprehend


it
 when
 I
 say
 life
 is
 the
 cloud
 and


death
 is
 the
 rain.
 And
 I
 got
 to
 my
 stop


and
 felt
 kind
 of
 mad.
 Not
 sure
 he


answered
 the
 questions
 I
 had.
 Then
 I


looked
 up
 and
 saw
 the
 sun
 rising.
 Said,


"You're
 looking
 for
 heaven,
 but
 you're


the
 one
 hiding."


[laughter]


>> LJ,
 thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 writing


these
 incredible
 books
 that
 I
 highly


recommend
 anybody
 who
 is
 on
 their
 own


journey
 to
 financial
 freedom
 and
 is


looking
 for
 a
 free
 life,
 a
 financial


independence
 or
 just
 independence
 from


one's
 own
 tormenting
 psychology
 should
 h


should
 uh
 should
 buy
 this
 book.
 The


simple
 path
 to
 wealth
 has
 been
 an


absolute
 smash
 hit
 for
 um
 understandable


reasons
 once
 you
 read
 it.
 Sold
 many


millions
 of
 copies
 from
 what
 I


understand,
 more
 than
 a
 million
 copies


at least.
 And
 I
 highly
 recommend


everybody
 goes
 and
 starts
 with
 this
 book


and
 then
 picks
 up
 Pathfinders.
 I'm
 going


to
 link
 both
 of
 these
 books
 below.
 And


there
 is
 a
 third
 book,
 it's
 slightly


smaller,
 called
 How
 I
 Lost
 Money
 in
 Real


Estate
 Before
 It
 Was
 Fashionable,
 A


Cautionary
 Tale.
 Um,
 I'm
 going
 to
 link


all
 of
 them
 below.
 And
 if
 anybody
 else


wants
 to
 find
 more
 of
 your
 work,
 is


there
 anywhere
 else
 that
 they
 can
 get
 in


contact
 with
 you,
 read
 your
 work
 that
 I


should
 recommend?
 So
 probably
 the


easiest
 thing
 is
 the
 blog
 which
 is


jlinsnh


at
 uh
 or.com
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 you'll
 find


a
 lot
 of
 my
 writing.
 I
 don't
 write
 on


the
 blog
 too
 much
 anymore
 but
 the


material
 that's
 there
 is
 evergreen.
 It's


the
 source
 material
 for
 the
 books
 that


you
 were
 kind
 enough
 to
 share.
 Uh
 the


last
 book
 the
 how
 I
 lost
 money
 in
 real


estate
 is
 if
 somebody
 wants
 to
 have
 a


laugh
 at
 my
 expense
 that's
 the
 book
 they


want
 to
 pick
 up.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 doing
 so
 much
 of
 what
 you


do.
 Um,
 I
 know
 what
 the
 comments
 are


going
 to
 say
 already.
 They're
 going
 to


be
 people
 talking
 about
 how
 soothing


your
 voice
 is,
 and
 I
 [laughter]
 I
 happen


to
 I
 happen
 to
 agree.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> My
 pleasure.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


>> If
 there's
 anything
 we
 need,
 it
 is


connection,
 especially
 in
 the
 world


we're
 living
 in
 today.
 And
 that
 is


exactly
 why
 we
 created
 these


conversation
 cards.
 Because
 on
 this


show,
 when
 I
 sit
 here
 with
 my
 guests
 and


have
 those
 deep,
 intimate
 conversations,


this
 remarkable
 thing
 happens
 time
 and


time
 again.
 We
 feel
 deeply
 connected
 to


each
 other.
 At
 the
 end
 of
 every
 episode,


the
 guest
 I'm
 interviewing
 leaves
 a


question
 for
 the
 next
 guest,
 and
 we've


turned
 them
 into
 these
 conversation


cards,
 and
 we've
 added
 these
 twist
 cards


to
 make
 your
 conversations
 even
 more


interesting.
 And
 there
 are
 so
 many
 more


twists
 along
 the
 way
 with
 the


conversation
 cards.
 This
 is
 the
 brand


new
 edition
 and
 for
 the
 first
 time
 ever,


I've
 added
 to
 the
 pack
 this
 gold
 card,


which
 is
 an
 exclusive
 question
 from
 me.


But
 I'm
 only
 putting
 the
 gold
 cards
 in


the
 first
 run
 of
 conversation
 cards.
 So


get
 yours
 now
 before
 the
 limited
 edition


gold
 cards
 are
 all
 gone.
