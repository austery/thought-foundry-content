Google
 is
 the
 world's
 most
 used
 company


by
 the
 number
 of
 users
 between
 products


like
 Google
 search,
 YouTube,
 Chrome,


Android,
 and
 many
 more.
 But
 what's
 the


company
 like
 from
 an
 engineing
 point
 of


view?
 We've
 spent
 months
 researching


this
 topic
 to
 bring
 you
 the
 most


detailed
 deep
 dive
 to
 date
 on
 Google's


engineing
 culture.
 We
 go
 into
 Google's


unique
 tech
 stack
 and
 why
 every
 tool
 is


custom
 at
 the
 company.
 How
 Google
 works,


roles,
 compensation,
 performance


reviews,
 on
 call
 and
 internal
 mobility.


How
 Google
 changed
 over
 the
 decades
 and


advice
 on
 how
 to
 thrive
 at
 the
 Google
 of


today
 as
 a
 software
 engineer
 and
 many


more
 topics.
 If
 you
 ever
 wanted
 to
 work


at
 Google
 as
 an
 engineer
 or
 manager
 or


want
 to
 understand
 how
 one
 of
 the


world's
 most
 innovative
 tech
 companies


operates,
 this
 episode
 is
 for
 you.
 This


podcast
 episode
 is
 presented
 by
 Statsig,


the
 unified
 platform
 for
 flags,


analytics,
 experiments,
 and
 more.
 Check

 So,


let's
 get
 started.
 Hi,
 I'm
 Gerge,
 your


podcast
 host
 and
 author
 of
 The
 Pragmatic


Engineer.
 Hi,
 I'm
 Alen
 and
 you
 may
 or


may
 not
 know
 me
 as
 the
 researcher
 uh
 of


the
 pragmatic
 engineer.
 You
 might
 have


seen
 my
 by
 line
 in
 some
 of
 our
 deep


dives
 and
 survey
 articles.


Uh,
 and
 today
 we're
 going
 to
 try
 out


this
 new
 format
 to
 bring
 you
 a
 deep
 dive


by
 talking
 you
 through
 uh,
 everything


Google.
 So,
 I
 I
 was
 an
 intern
 at
 Google


for
 a
 couple
 months
 back
 in
 2015.
 I
 was


based
 in
 the
 London
 office.
 Uh,
 worked


as
 an
 a
 UX
 intern
 actually.
 Um,
 that
 was


before
 I
 uh,
 worked
 as
 an
 engineer
 after


that.
 Uh
 so
 I
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 of


like
 inside
 vibes
 but


not
 that
 much.


>> Let's
 start
 with
 everyone
 knows
 Google


for
 sure.
 You
 you
 cannot
 not
 know
 it
 but


what
 are
 some
 interesting
 stat
 stuff
 we


found
 about
 them?


>> The
 numbers
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 there


like
 it
 is
 easy
 to
 forget
 how
 big
 Google


is
 sometimes.
 So
 yeah,
 the
 the
 latest


numbers
 there's
 182,000
 employees
 across


all
 of
 Alphabet.
 Uh
 but
 obviously
 the


majority
 of
 that
 is
 in
 Google.
 We
 have


numbers
 from
 2020
 that
 there
 were
 about


50,000
 engineers
 and
 that's
 up.
 So
 like


in
 2015,
 which
 was
 the
 first
 time
 they


came
 out
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 numbers
 about


the
 engineering
 work,
 there
 were
 25,000


engineers.
 I
 think
 size-wise
 this
 makes


them
 similar
 to
 Microsoft
 in
 total


employee
 count
 for
 engineers.
 A
 bit


unclear.
 Maybe
 Google
 has
 more
 maybe


Microsoft.
 Probably
 similar
 to
 Amazon,


but
 Amazon
 has
 weird
 numbers
 cuz
 they


kind
 of
 mesh
 the
 the
 workers,
 but


they're
 they're
 a
 lot
 bigger
 than
 Meta,


for
 example.
 Like
 they're
 they're
 like
 I


think
 two,
 three
 times
 bigger.
 So


they're
 easily
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 kind


of
 top
 tech
 companies
 in
 the
 world,
 if


not
 the
 biggest.
 I
 I I
 think
 the


question
 is
 with
 Microsoft,
 but
 I
 think


when
 it
 come
 to
 prestige
 uh


compensation,
 uh
 they're
 they're
 easily


number
 one
 in
 in
 this
 regards.
 Uh
 scale


of
 of
 of
 work
 that
 that
 people
 work
 on.


And
 speaking
 of
 of
 scale,
 uh
 you
 know,


like
 again
 Microsoft
 might
 have
 similar


number
 of
 employees,
 but
 when
 it
 comes


to
 Google,
 I
 think
 numbers
 are
 a
 bit


unclear,
 but
 around
 3
 to
 4
 billion


people
 per
 month
 use
 their
 services


between
 search,
 Gmail,
 YouTube.
 I
 mean


all
 of
 these
 are
 marketing
 services


right
 I
 think
 search
 is
 more
 than
 1


billion
 people
 per
 day
 which
 is
 kind
 of


one
 like
 every
 I
 think
 nine
 person
 in


the
 world
 uses
 search
 uh
 YouTube
 has
 2.5


billion
 monthly
 which
 is
 more
 than
 TV


viewers
 and
 then
 Gmail
 has
 1.8
 8
 billion


active
 users
 and
 I
 I'm
 pretty
 sure


looking
 at
 my
 my
 newsletter
 about
 70
 or


60
 70%
 of
 emails
 are
 are
 Gmail.


>> Yeah,
 for
 sure.
 I'
 I've
 seen
 the
 same


stats
 and
 like
 if
 you
 broaden
 out
 the


Google
 Workspace
 apps
 like
 including


Drive
 and
 Docs
 and
 Calendar
 and
 stuff,


they
 have
 over
 three
 billion
 users
 and


like
 over
 50%
 market
 share.
 like
 they're


so
 far
 ahead
 of
 of
 Microsoft
 and
 Office


essentially
 with
 YouTube
 as
 well.
 Like
 I


can't
 help
 I
 I'm
 a
 big
 YouTube
 user
 and


have
 been
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 I
 I'm


always
 so
 fascinated
 by
 their
 general


stats.
 Uh
 like
 there's
 5
 billion
 videos


on
 YouTube.
 Not
 all
 of
 them
 are


necessarily
 like
 up
 and
 available.
 like


the
 latest
 numbers
 360


hours
 of
 content
 is
 uploaded
 every


single
 minute.


>> Yeah,
 that
 that's
 a
 lot
 of
 parallel


processing.


>> There's
 2.6
 million
 videos
 uploaded


every
 day.
 Almost
 a
 billion
 a
 year
 and
 a


billion
 hours
 of
 video
 is
 consumed
 every


day.


>> Yeah,
 those
 are
 just
 just
 large
 numbers.


And
 I
 think
 like
 you
 know
 this
 is
 the


thing
 with
 Google,
 right?
 Technically


it's
 not
 even
 called
 Google.


Technically,
 it's
 Alphabet,
 which
 the


biggest
 part
 is
 is
 uh
 Google
 that
 that


still
 owns
 things
 that
 like
 Chrome,
 the


leading
 uh
 web
 browser,
 Android,
 which


is
 still
 the
 the
 leading
 smartphone


platform
 globally
 by
 a
 lot
 by
 about
 70%.


In
 the
 US,
 uh
 iOS
 is
 now
 getting
 bigger.


So,
 that
 can
 be
 a
 bit
 bit
 misleading.


But
 then
 there's
 things
 like


self-driving.
 you
 know
 if
 it's


self-driving
 it's
 the
 only
 the


commercial
 leading
 one
 is
 is
 Whimo
 which


is
 which
 is
 not
 part
 of
 Google
 but
 part


of
 Alphabet
 and
 in
 terms
 of
 the


footprint


>> yeah
 Google's
 big
 like
 just
 globally
 as


well
 they
 have
 72
 offices
 in
 over
 50


countries
 or
 50
 countries
 so
 they
 have


offices
 all
 around
 the
 globe
 US
 Europe


Asia
 Sydney
 Brazil


>> yeah
 but
 what
 we
 care
 mostly
 about
 is
 is


engineering
 so
 they're
 engineering


offices
 there's
 about
 like
 there's
 more


than
 25
 ones,
 but
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 the


big
 ones
 that
 we
 we
 should
 definitely


mention,
 headquarters,
 Mountain
 View
 in


Silicon
 Valley,


>> the
 Google
 Plex.


>> The
 Google
 Plex.
 Yeah.
 Really
 cool


office.
 Like
 really
 cool
 u
 kind
 of


perks.
 Android
 figures.
 It
 was
 so
 cool.


I
 I
 was
 there
 last
 year.
 Addiosmani
 uh


took
 me
 around
 on
 on
 the
 Chrome
 team
 in


New
 York
 office
 also
 big
 one.
 Seattle


and
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 offices
 in


smaller
 ones
 in
 in
 the
 US.
 LA,


Pittsburgh,
 Boulder,
 a
 lot
 of
 like


specialized
 ones.


>> Cambridge
 and
 Massachusetts
 is
 pretty


big
 as
 well.
 Yeah,
 the
 the
 Seattle
 uh


Seattle
 office
 is
 definitely
 one
 of
 the


bigger
 one.
 And
 uh
 you
 might
 hear
 it


referred
 to
 as
 Kirkland
 as
 well
 because


Kirkland
 is
 the
 suburb
 of
 Seattle
 where


it
 is
 and
 it's
 um
 yeah,
 lots
 of
 cloud
 is


based
 there.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 Europe
 and
 the
 UK
 have


large
 offices.
 The
 biggest
 one
 known
 in


Europe
 is
 Turk.
 It's
 actually
 probably


Google's
 European
 HQ
 in
 terms
 of


engineering
 if
 if
 you
 will.
 And
 a
 fun


fact
 is
 that
 Turk
 pays
 almost
 as
 much
 in


compensation
 as
 in
 the
 US
 which
 is


really
 really
 interesting.
 A
 lot
 higher


than
 their
 Europe
 other
 European


offices.
 London
 is
 another
 huge
 office.


Dublin
 a
 big
 one.
 Dublin
 I
 think
 might


be
 bigger
 than
 Zurich
 in
 terms
 of
 people


but
 not
 necessarily
 engineering.


>> Ah


>> like
 they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 sales.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Makes
 sense.
 Makes
 sense.


>> Oh,
 you're
 right.
 I
 actually
 used
 to


have
 friends
 uh
 nontechnical
 uh
 who
 who


were
 in
 Dublin
 that
 Yeah,
 that
 was


You're
 right.
 You're
 probably
 the
 big


but
 I
 was
 thinking
 engineering.


>> Engineering
 is
 the
 biggest
 hub
 for
 sure.


>> Munich
 is
 a
 big
 one
 for
 engineering
 as


well
 in
 in
 Germany.
 They
 have
 a
 Berlin


one.
 I
 I
 understand
 that
 it's
 a
 bit


smaller.
 And
 in
 Paris
 is
 a
 research


office
 as
 I
 understand.
 There's
 a
 bunch


of
 smaller
 ones.
 Like
 the
 thing
 with


Google
 is
 they
 do
 have
 like
 some
 smaller


bits.
 For example,
 even
 in
 Budapash,


Hungary,
 they
 had
 a
 very
 small


engineering
 office.
 I
 think
 they
 still


have,
 but
 it's
 it's
 tiny
 compared


compared
 to
 all
 these
 other
 ones.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 actually
 one
 here.
 I'm


based
 in
 Stockholm.
 So,
 they
 have
 an


office
 here
 as
 well
 that's
 uh
 grown
 a


fair
 bit.
 It's
 like
 a
 few
 hundred


people.
 Fairly
 big
 on
 the
 engineering


side.
 work
 a
 lot
 on
 uh
 video
 meets
 and


calls
 and
 stuff


>> and
 a
 lot
 of
 US
 tech
 companies
 would


stop
 here
 but
 Google
 obviously
 being


Google
 they
 they
 have
 engineering


offices
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 places


Bangalore
 and
 Hydrobot
 are
 two
 massive


offices
 in
 in
 India


>> they've
 grown
 so
 much
 as
 well
 like


they're
 and
 growing
 like
 those
 are
 like


a
 lot
 of
 the
 open
 positions
 are
 based
 in


India


>> yeah
 we
 we
 had
 an
 issue
 with
 that
 when
 I


when
 I
 used
 to
 work
 at
 uh
 Uber
 as
 an


injury
 manager.
 Uh
 we
 were
 hiring
 in


Bangalore
 and
 what
 we
 found
 is
 we
 had


trouble
 hiring
 senior
 engineers
 because


whenever
 we'd
 extend
 an
 offer
 and
 that


person
 was
 interviewing
 at
 Google,


Google
 would
 offer
 10%
 more
 than


whatever
 we
 did.
 Always
 10%
 more.
 So


after
 a
 while
 back,
 this
 was
 back


several
 years
 ago,
 but
 the
 team
 kind
 of


backed
 down
 and
 they
 started
 to
 hire


like
 less
 experienced
 engineer.
 It
 this


was
 a
 big
 kind
 of
 hiring
 fight.
 But


there
 is
 this
 thing
 about
 Google,
 by
 the


way.
 If
 you
 have
 a
 competing
 offer,


Google
 and
 they
 want
 you
 and
 then
 you're


like
 senior
 and
 above,
 Google
 almost


always
 will
 offer
 more.
 They
 don't
 care


too
 much
 about
 their
 internal
 bands.


Again,
 over
 time,
 this
 might
 have


changed
 and
 for
 more
 junior
 positions,


this
 could
 have
 changed.
 But
 I
 had
 a


director
 of
 friend
 who
 was
 in
 the


situation
 uh
 between
 uh
 having
 a


competing
 offer
 at
 uh
 Meta
 and
 Google


and
 and
 and
 it
 was
 really
 high
 already


and
 then
 Google
 just
 really
 wanted
 this


person
 and
 they
 just
 offered
 more.


Google
 like
 when
 you
 become
 in
 demand


this
 is
 a
 really
 interesting
 situation


but
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of
 an
 open
 secret
 on


on
 the
 job
 market
 and
 then
 they
 have


offices
 Tokyo,
 Japan,
 Sydney,
 Australia


and
 probably
 every
 kind
 of
 major
 city


and
 and
 you'll
 have
 like
 so
 Google
 has


so
 many
 offices
 right
 and
 engineering


can
 pop
 up
 anywhere.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 They
 they
 have
 a
 pretty


big
 one
 in
 u
 Brazil
 as
 well
 in
 Sa
 Paulo.


They
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 search
 engineers.
 But


it's
 also
 it's
 funny
 um
 because
 one
 of


the
 stats
 for
 Google
 is
 like
 they've


always
 had
 such
 good
 revenue.
 So
 like


back
 in
 in
 2024
 there
 was
 $350
 billion


in
 revenue.
 75%
 of
 that
 comes
 from
 ads.


And
 I
 think
 Google
 like
 they've
 done


good
 for
 themselves
 because
 they
 figured


out
 such
 a
 good
 revenue
 model
 from
 day


one
 for
 themselves.
 So
 they've
 always


been
 able
 to
 offer
 all
 of
 these
 high


salaries
 and
 pay
 for
 so
 much
 stuff.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 challenge
 you
 a
 little
 bit


because
 I
 so
 like
 we
 know
 like
 Google
 is


insanely
 profitable,
 right?
 Like
 there


is
 no
 doubt
 about
 it.
 However,
 when
 we


look
 a
 little
 bit
 closer
 at
 the
 unit


economics
 and
 you
 we're
 going
 to
 we're


going
 to
 quickly
 move
 to
 engineering,


but
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 kind
 of
 where


the
 money
 comes
 from.
 Google's
 like


profit
 margin
 of
 like
 you
 know
 on
 $100,


how
 many
 dollars
 is
 profit
 is
 is
 around


like
 30
 or
 35%.
 So
 like
 you
 know
 $30
 or


$35
 are
 pure
 profit
 and
 they're
 not
 the


most
 profitable
 company.
 Companies
 like


Visa
 or
 Mastercard
 and
 Aen
 they
 do
 about


$60
 or
 60%
 profit
 rate
 but
 those


companies
 don't
 pay
 as
 much
 as
 Google


does
 for
 their
 engineers.
 So
 there's


this
 interesting
 thing
 where
 there
 have


been
 companies
 earlier
 who
 have
 found


out
 similarly
 really
 lucrative
 really


good
 business
 models
 again
 like
 with


Mastercard
 you
 know
 you
 you
 make
 a


transaction
 they
 take
 a
 percentage
 they


built
 out
 the
 global
 network
 boom
 profit


but
 they
 don't
 compensate
 engineers
 or


they
 don't
 they
 don't
 kind
 of
 treat


engineers
 the
 way
 Google
 does
 which


we're
 going
 to
 talk
 a
 lot
 about.
 So,
 I


think
 Google
 did
 something
 interesting


where
 like
 by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 episode,


we're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 better
 idea
 of


what
 actually
 happened.
 But
 there's
 two


things,
 right?
 Either
 they
 they
 created


this
 new
 thing
 where
 they
 became
 so


profitable
 because
 they
 treated


engineers
 so
 well.
 Or
 despite
 being
 so


profitable,
 they're
 treating
 engineers


really
 well
 and
 maybe
 they're
 becoming


even
 more
 profitable
 and
 now
 a
 lot


bigger
 than
 Mastercard
 or
 or
 Visa
 or


other
 companies.
 Now
 one
 interesting


thing
 that
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 bring
 up
 is
 is


when
 you
 joined
 Google
 there
 was
 this
 uh


note
 from
 a
 founder
 who
 got
 acquired
 uh


by
 Google
 called
 Treyas
 Banzal
 uh


10erson
 startup
 got
 acquired
 several


years
 ago
 and
 on
 a
 blog
 post
 uh
 this
 is


what
 he
 wrote
 uh
 he
 wrote
 working
 at


Google
 is
 like
 having
 a
 second
 passport


go
 to
 animate
 your
 city
 in
 the
 world
 and


you
 badge
 your
 badge
 unlocks
 beautiful


office
 with
 with
 great
 food
 great
 desk


and
 a
 high-speed
 link
 to
 every
 person
 in


Google's
 200
 100,000
 person
 network
 and


it's
 like
 visiting
 America
 as
 a


foreigner.
 Everything
 you
 see
 inside


feels
 oddly
 familiar
 because
 of
 his


massive
 export
 influence
 yet
 is
 just


slightly
 slightly
 different.
 I
 thought


this
 is
 fascinating.
 So
 like
 you
 when


you
 join
 Google
 you
 have
 suddenly
 access


to
 all
 the
 offices
 you
 you
 you
 can
 go


into
 any
 of
 the
 offices.
 I
 mean
 travel


budgets
 permitting.
 I
 understand
 they


now
 have
 some
 of
 those
 but
 yeah
 you
 have


access
 to
 this
 and
 and
 to
 all
 of
 the
 the


people.
 I
 think
 this
 is
 something
 that
 a


lot
 of
 people
 don't
 realize
 from
 the


outside
 of
 just
 how
 it's
 it
 is
 one


company
 but
 it's
 also
 more.


>> Yeah,
 that
 actually
 resonates
 quite
 a


lot
 with
 my
 exper
 my
 brief
 experience


there
 as
 well.
 Again,
 we'll
 get
 into


this
 but
 yeah,
 I
 think
 Google
 is
 so


special
 especially
 if
 you
 compare
 it
 to


the
 other
 big
 tech
 companies
 because


like
 in
 many
 ways
 like
 there's
 no
 one


Google
 like
 it's
 not
 one
 company
 working


on
 one
 thing
 from
 very
 early
 on
 they


worked
 on.
 so
 many
 different
 things.
 So


like
 you
 can
 reminisce
 my
 memories
 of


Google
 is
 like
 like
 it
 feels
 more
 like


you
 can
 talk
 to
 other
 Googlers
 and
 it


feels
 like
 they
 would
 be
 at
 like
 working


at
 a
 completely
 different
 company
 but


you
 you're
 in
 this
 like
 alternate


reality
 bubble
 where
 when
 you're
 in
 the


bubble
 you
 know
 so
 many
 things
 so
 that


you
 can
 only
 talk
 about
 with
 other


Googlers
 which
 yeah
 are
 like
 so
 it's


more
 like
 they're
 in
 the
 same
 alternate


universe
 bubble
 as
 you
 rather
 than
 at


the
 same
 company
 as
 you.
 And
 yeah,
 the


badge
 is
 really
 the
 the
 passport
 to
 that


really.
 It's
 a
 it's
 a
 really
 fascinating


place
 to
 be.


>> So
 Google
 has
 the
 most
 unique
 tech
 stack


in
 the
 world
 and
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 go


into
 a
 lot
 more
 detail,
 but
 they
 have


customuilt
 everything.
 So
 unlike
 almost


every
 other
 startup
 or
 company
 that
 has


some
 level
 of
 standard
 tech
 stack
 that


the
 rest
 of
 the
 industry
 uses,
 Google


just
 uses
 their
 own
 stuff
 and
 it
 works


really
 well
 for
 them.
 uh
 which
 which
 has


an
 interesting
 outcome.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We'll
 get
 into
 a
 lot
 more


detail.


>> They
 also
 influence
 if
 not
 even
 kind
 of


indirectly
 created
 how
 hiring
 is
 done


today
 with
 these
 lead
 code
 style


interviews.
 They
 started
 with
 the


algorithical
 interviews
 and
 they
 kind
 of


I
 guess
 the
 perception
 of
 of
 how
 Google


having
 a
 hiring
 bar
 made
 it
 go


mainstream
 across
 the
 tech
 industry
 and


then
 they
 also
 invented
 roles
 like
 the


SR
 role
 which
 is
 now
 kind
 of
 pretty


widespread
 across
 other
 companies
 as


well.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Even
 though
 it
 might
 be


called
 something
 slightly
 different
 with


like
 you
 know
 DevOps,
 reliability


engineering
 etc
 etc.
 One
 thing
 that
 is


very
 unique
 about
 Google
 is
 how
 many


internal
 tools
 that
 they've
 built.
 Borg,


blaze,
 piper,
 critique,
 code
 search.


We'll
 talk
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 today.


>> Yeah,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 to
 them.
 In


many
 ways,
 Google
 was
 one
 of the
 first


modern
 software
 companies
 and
 how
 we


think
 about
 them
 today.
 Not
 just
 all
 the


perks
 that
 they
 provide,
 but
 building


best-in-class
 internal
 tools.
 They
 also


pioneered
 something
 that
 we
 take
 for


granted
 today.
 Great
 data
 tools
 for


product
 and
 engineering
 teams.
 Google


was
 one
 of the
 first
 companies
 to
 take


analytics,
 dashboards,
 AB
 testing,


feature
 controls,
 all
 of
 them
 together


seriously.
 They
 built
 advanced
 tools
 and


made
 it
 available
 to
 their
 thousands
 of


engineers
 and
 data
 scientists.
 This
 was


the
 approach
 that
 enabled
 a
 fastmoving


bottoms
 of
 approach
 to
 product


development.


>> And
 this
 practice
 of
 having
 your


engineering
 teams
 have
 access
 to
 these


tools
 really
 did
 become
 the
 baseline
 for


standout
 tech
 companies.
 Um,
 for
 the


last
 15
 years,
 pretty
 much
 every
 major


tech
 company
 has
 had
 entire
 teams
 of


people
 rebuilding
 this
 kind
 of
 feature


flagging
 AB
 testing
 stack
 of
 tools


internally.


>> But
 now
 something
 interesting
 is


happening
 with
 the
 latest
 generation
 of


tech
 giants.
 Rather
 than
 building
 these


tools,
 companies
 like
 OpenAI,
 Antrophic,


Figma,
 Notion,
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 others,


they're
 just
 using
 Statsig.
 Static
 has


rebuilt
 this
 entire
 suite
 of
 data
 tools


that
 was
 available
 at
 maybe
 10
 or
 15


giants
 in
 a
 such
 a
 powerful
 way
 until


now.
 They
 built
 experimentation
 with


proper
 statistical
 analysis,
 feature


flags
 for
 save
 deployments,
 session


replace
 analytics,
 and
 more.
 All
 backed


by
 a
 single
 set
 of
 product
 data.


>> And
 one
 really
 nice
 thing
 about
 Statig,


it's
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 saving


engineering
 time.
 It's
 about
 getting


worldclass
 infrastructure
 from
 day
 one


without
 having
 to
 build
 it
 yourself.


Rather
 than
 arguing
 about
 metrics


definition
 or
 troubleshooting
 broken


tools,
 engineering
 teams
 can
 just
 focus


on
 building
 a
 really
 great
 product.


>> The
 other
 thing
 is
 scale.
 Since
 already


processes
 trillions
 of
 events
 per
 day,


which
 is
 enormous
 data,
 by
 the
 way,
 they


also
 scale
 with
 you.
 Plus,
 you
 can


integrate
 Staxig
 into
 your
 existing


product
 data
 easily
 as
 well.
 If
 you're


interested
 in
 giving
 your
 product
 team


an
 access
 to
 incredible
 data
 tools,
 go


to
 stats.com/pragmatic.


They
 have
 a
 generous
 free
 tier,
 a


$50,000
 starter
 program,
 affordable


enterprise
 plans.
 Just
 tell
 them
 the


pragmatic
 engineers
 sent
 you.
 So
 one


thing
 that
 is
 like
 so
 unique
 about


Google
 is
 they
 have
 completely
 custom


internal
 infrastructure
 even
 today
 and


there's
 a
 reason
 for
 this
 because
 when


they
 started
 back
 then
 they
 needed
 to


build
 this
 knowing
 how
 uh
 the
 existing


tools
 didn't
 work
 for
 their
 scale.
 So


maybe
 let's
 let's
 talk
 through
 some
 of


the
 unique
 uh
 tools
 tool
 set
 that


someone
 would
 see
 if
 they
 start
 to
 work


inside
 Google
 or
 or
 if
 they're
 they're


working
 there,
 they
 they
 see
 them.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 And
 I
 think
 actually
 it's


like
 why
 this
 tech
 stack
 looks
 the
 way


it
 does
 is
 very
 like
 it
 it's
 because


like
 because
 it
 was
 search.
 It's
 like


well
 this
 needs
 to
 be
 global
 from
 day


one.
 So
 we
 need
 to
 have
 this
 in


infrastructure
 from
 day
 one
 to
 get
 the


speed
 and
 re
 and
 reliability
 that
 we


want.
 And
 so
 that's
 why
 they
 just
 jumped


straight
 ahead
 with
 like
 we'll
 just


build
 custom
 stuff
 from
 the
 ground
 up.


So
 yeah,
 like
 they
 scaled
 into
 six


digits
 of
 machines
 in
 the
 early
 2000s.


>> So
 like
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of


machines.


>> Yeah.
 In
 their
 data
 centers.
 Yeah.
 There


was
 a
 pragmatic
 engineer
 post
 from
 an
 SR


a
 couple
 months
 ago
 I
 want
 to
 say
 where


he
 talks
 about
 he
 started
 at
 Google
 uh


doing
 S
 sur
 in
 2004
 I
 think
 it
 was
 and


already
 when
 he
 started
 there
 were


hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 machines
 and


this
 was
 during
 a
 time
 when


large
 data
 centers
 had
 hundreds
 or
 maybe


thousands
 of
 machines.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 This
 this
 this
 is
 Dave
 O


Connor
 and
 he
 was
 telling
 me
 that
 I


think
 in
 Ireland
 they
 they
 visited
 a
 a


data
 center
 cuz
 they
 they
 wanted
 to
 see


how
 they
 worked
 and
 they
 wanted
 to
 see


if
 they
 could
 use
 them
 and
 in
 the
 end


they
 figured
 out
 they
 couldn't
 but
 they


asked
 like
 okay
 how
 do
 you
 manage
 your


your
 machines
 and
 they
 were
 like
 oh
 we


just
 do
 manual
 updates
 and
 like
 they're


like
 how
 many
 machines
 do
 you
 have
 and
 I


think
 they
 had
 like
 maybe
 a
 thousand
 or


so
 and
 they
 just
 did
 manually
 and
 then


they
 were
 telling
 them
 like
 well
 that


wouldn't
 really
 work
 for
 us
 cuz
 we
 we're


planning
 to
 have
 at
 least
 10,000


machines
 but
 maybe
 30
 soon
 And
 they
 were


like
 what
 are
 you
 guys
 talking
 about


like
 that's
 so
 because
 of
 this
 like
 the


kind
 of
 the
 most
 advanced
 solutions
 in


the
 case
 of
 data
 centers
 they
 didn't


have
 the
 ambitions
 that
 Google
 had
 and


that's
 why
 like
 even
 in
 the
 early
 days


like
 they
 knew
 like
 okay
 we
 cannot
 do


what
 everyone
 else
 is
 doing
 we
 we
 need


to
 figure
 out
 build
 new
 automation
 build


new
 tools
 and
 that's
 actually
 how
 they


invented
 the
 site
 reliability
 engineer


role
 they
 they
 actually
 needed
 software


or
 software
 engineers
 who
 now
 became


experts
 at
 like
 operating
 infrastructure


which
 was
 unheard
 of
 Because
 until
 then


you
 had
 the
 IT
 guys
 uh
 who
 who
 knew
 how


to
 configure,
 you
 know,
 Windows
 machines


or
 Linux
 machines
 and
 and
 knew
 how
 to


patch
 them,
 how
 to
 plug
 in,
 how
 to,
 you


know,
 make
 sure
 like
 do
 all
 these


things,
 but
 they
 were
 not
 software


engineers
 cuz
 why
 would
 you
 hire
 a


software
 engineer
 to
 do
 to
 do
 that?
 So


like
 Google
 did
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 things


and
 and
 that's
 where
 obviously
 one
 of


their
 biggest
 uh
 internal
 tools
 which
 we


mentioned
 bore
 comes
 from
 uh
 which
 is


orchestration
 system
 and
 and
 Kubernetes


uh
 was
 inspired
 by
 this.
 In
 fact,
 Google


created
 Kubernetes
 based
 on
 lessons


learned
 from
 Borg
 and
 they
 released
 it


in
 open
 source
 and
 internally
 they
 still


use
 Borg.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 So,
 yeah.
 So,
 Borg
 is


basically
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 cluster


operating
 system


>> and
 then
 you
 know
 do
 you
 know
 what
 uh


Google's
 kind
 of
 internal
 version
 of


data
 log
 is
 called?
 Borgmon.
 Oh,
 yeah.


There's
 also
 one
 called
 Monarch.
 I
 I
 I'm


not
 sure
 which
 one
 is
 which,
 but
 yeah.


So,
 they
 have
 a
 so
 they
 have
 this


monitoring
 which
 is
 like
 integrated
 into


Borg.
 And
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 by


the
 way
 Google
 people
 are
 like
 oh
 why


doesn't
 Google
 just
 move
 to
 Kubernetes


and
 well
 I
 mean
 then
 they
 would
 need
 to


replace
 some
 of
 these
 things.
 Oh
 and


then
 they
 have
 this
 thing
 called
 uh


third
 eye
 uh
 which
 is
 their
 which
 is


pretty
 much
 what
 Sentry
 is
 from
 the


outside
 world
 and
 that's
 also
 nicely


integrated
 into
 all
 of
 these
 systems.


It's
 kind
 of
 like
 got
 all
 the
 hooks
 got


all
 the
 APIs.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 all
 of
 the
 tech
 stack
 is


custom.
 Like
 there's
 nothing
 that's
 not


custom
 in
 the
 Google
 tech
 stack.
 So,


Borg
 uh
 they
 call
 it
 a
 cluster
 operating


system
 and
 it's
 yeah
 like
 one
 of
 the


first
 things
 they
 built
 is
 like


realizing
 okay
 we
 need
 huge
 data
 centers


we
 need
 so
 many
 more
 machines
 than


anyone's
 ever
 had.
 What
 do
 we
 need
 in


order
 to
 operate
 this
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is


automated
 and
 not
 manual
 because
 that's


not
 going
 to
 scale.
 The
 Google
 data


centers
 are
 are
 and
 always
 were
 built


kind
 of
 like
 from
 the
 ground
 up
 by


Google
 and
 designed
 in
 ways
 that
 would


fit
 their
 scale.
 Like
 because
 it
 was


like
 planet
 scale
 search
 from
 the
 get-


go,
 they
 never
 had
 to
 think
 about,
 you


know,
 like,
 oh,
 what's
 the
 data
 center


for
 like
 the
 smallest
 need
 because
 their


need
 was
 so
 huge
 from
 the
 get-go.
 Well,


well,
 and
 and
 there
 was
 this
 interesting


thing,
 right,
 where
 until
 Google,
 the


way
 to
 operate
 servers
 was
 to
 buy
 these


really
 expensive
 sun
 racks,
 the
 the
 kind


of
 like,
 you
 know,
 like
 mainframes


pretty
 much,
 super
 powerful
 machines.


And
 Google
 also
 had
 this
 innovation


where
 they
 started
 to
 just
 use
 plain
 old


PCs
 initially
 literally
 just
 took
 simple


PCs
 that
 they
 put
 together
 on
 like
 the


the
 main
 frame,
 the
 CPU,
 the
 the
 hard


drive,
 and
 they
 just
 put
 it
 together
 and


put
 it
 in
 data
 center.
 And
 people
 were


like,
 "What?
 That's
 that's
 so
 silly."


But
 they're
 like, "Look,
 we're
 getting
 a


lot
 better
 value
 for
 a
 buck
 instead
 of
 a


$2,000
 machine.
 We
 can
 have
 20
 $100


machines
 and
 we
 can
 have
 throughput
 of


three
 times."
 And
 then
 they
 started
 to


take
 this
 a
 bit
 more
 seriously
 and
 I


started
 to
 manufacture
 their
 own


servers,
 which
 cannot
 be
 bought
 by


anyone,
 but
 but
 that's
 how
 their


internal
 data
 centers
 are
 built.
 Google


Cloud
 these
 days
 is
 built
 like
 that
 as


well,
 but
 Google's
 own
 infrastructure
 is


probably
 bigger
 than
 Google
 Cloud,


interesting
 enough.
 But
 you
 know,
 but
 as


as
 you
 just
 just
 to
 your
 point
 like
 they


they
 they
 they
 built
 a
 larger
 scale


compute
 than
 anyone
 needed
 at
 the
 time.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 And
 like
 with
 their


ambitions
 and
 knowing
 how
 big
 they


wanted
 to
 be
 and
 the
 kind
 of
 support


they
 wanted
 to
 provide,
 it's
 like
 well


this
 is
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do.
 I
 think


maybe
 also
 because
 of
 the
 SRV
 approach


to
 building
 out
 all
 of
 this
 stuff
 and


because
 that
 was
 so
 anchored
 in


software,
 uh
 they
 they
 did
 a
 thing
 quite


early
 on
 where
 they
 decided
 to
 rather


than
 going
 for
 like
 let's
 build
 the


perfect
 machines
 that
 will
 never
 fail,


they
 realized
 like
 at
 our
 scale,
 they're


going
 to
 fail
 anyway.
 So
 yeah,
 let's


just
 go
 with
 the
 cheap
 stuff
 that's
 easy


to
 replace
 and
 just
 build
 amazing


tooling
 on
 top
 of
 it
 that
 makes
 it
 nice


and
 easy
 for
 us
 to
 operate
 on.
 So
 like


yeah,
 today
 it's
 obviously
 like
 cloud


computing
 is
 it's
 the
 status
 quo.
 It's


what
 everyone's
 doing.
 But
 at
 the
 time


again
 like
 they
 did
 this
 in
 2003
 2004


this
 was
 unheard
 of
 and
 probably
 anyone


who
 heard
 of
 it
 was
 like
 what
 are
 you


doing?
 Why
 are
 you
 why
 would
 you
 do


that?
 Well,
 Jeff
 Bases
 might
 have
 heard


of
 it
 because
 he
 was
 an
 investor
 and
 you


know,
 like
 AWS
 later
 launched
 their


their
 public
 cloud,
 but
 but
 yeah,
 it's


it
 it
 was
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 it


wasn't
 just
 just
 unheard
 of
 it,
 but
 I


think
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 like
 Google
 was


seen
 very
 kind
 of
 weird
 a
 little
 bit
 or


like
 almost
 mythical
 for
 how
 they
 hired


cuz
 like
 the
 the
 way
 most
 tech
 companies


would
 hire
 at
 the
 time
 is
 they
 would
 ask


you
 programming
 questions
 of
 like
 I


don't
 know
 they
 hired
 a
 Java
 programmer


they
 would
 ask
 you
 all
 right
 how
 does


you
 know
 the
 memory
 allocation
 work
 in


Java
 or
 stuff
 like
 that
 or
 like
 if
 you


know
 they
 would
 ask
 about
 design


patterns
 or
 stuff
 like
 that
 and
 Google


like
 would
 ask
 brain
 teasers
 they
 they


would
 famously
 they
 would
 ask
 like
 okay


how
 many
 golf
 balls
 can
 you
 fit
 in
 a
 I


don't
 know
 like
 a
 van
 or
 something
 like


that
 and
 apparently
 the
 reason
 they
 did


this
 initially
 and
 they
 stopped
 doing
 it


after
 like
 several
 years
 but
 they
 wanted


people
 who
 can
 think
 outside
 the
 box


because
 they
 knew
 that
 they
 didn't
 want


to
 do
 what
 everyone
 else
 was
 doing
 they


didn't
 want
 to
 copy
 what
 Yahoo
 was
 doing


or
 what
 MySpace
 or
 any
 they
 wanted
 to


get
 the
 people
 who
 rejected
 you
 know
 the


conventional
 thinking
 and
 they
 were


still
 smart
 and
 brain
 teasers
 were
 seen


as
 a
 way
 to
 do
 this.
 Uh
 they
 they


stopped
 this
 several
 years
 later
 because


once
 this
 kind
 of
 went
 mainstream,
 you


know,
 people
 started
 to
 optimize
 for
 it


and
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 they
 also


rejected
 people
 who
 were
 smart
 but
 they


were
 just
 not
 good
 at
 brain
 teasers.


Most
 companies
 hire
 for
 the
 programming


language
 that
 they
 were
 using
 made
 up


maybe
 that
 was
 like
 cold
 fusion
 back
 in


the
 day
 or
 like
 again
 Java
 or
 Python
 or


whatever.
 And
 Google
 to
 this
 day
 doesn't


care
 about
 what
 language
 like
 you're


using.
 They
 just
 want
 you
 to
 use
 and
 and


write
 code
 with
 in
 in
 um
 a
 coding


exercise
 oftentimes
 you
 you
 can
 use
 any


language
 or
 sometimes
 you
 use
 code
 if


it's
 an
 algorithmical
 interview.
 This


was
 one
 of the
 reasons
 they
 love


algorithmical
 interviews.
 No
 no
 language


no
 specific
 language
 required.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 guess
 that
 makes
 sense
 as


well
 because
 the
 Google
 tech
 stack
 is
 so


unique.
 It
 doesn't
 like
 it
 won't
 matter


anyway.
 like
 they
 need
 you
 to
 have
 open


horizons
 simply
 flexible
 and
 solve


problems
 because
 you're
 going
 to
 solve


them
 differently
 at
 Google
 anyway.
 Going


back
 and
 speaking
 of
 just
 how
 custom
 it


is,
 the
 fact
 that
 like
 when
 they
 built


out
 these
 data
 centers,
 they
 also
 like


they
 couldn't
 use
 or
 didn't
 want
 to
 use


opted
 away
 from
 using
 normal
 like


networking
 stacks
 and
 switchboards
 and


stuff.
 They
 built
 that
 from
 scale
 as


well.
 Yeah.
 Why?


>> Uh
 so
 they
 have
 something
 called
 B4
 uh


which
 is
 like
 the
 backbone
 networking


infrastructure
 that
 has
 ridiculous


bandwidth
 and
 that's
 the
 thing
 that


their
 like
 they
 built
 out
 so
 that
 their


data
 centers
 and
 the
 ridiculous
 scale
 of


of
 the
 machines
 could
 talk
 to
 each
 other


and
 uh
 that
 Borg
 was
 able
 to
 coordinate


uh
 you
 know
 job
 allocations.
 They
 also


chose
 not
 to
 do
 DNS
 the
 standard
 way


because
 uh
 they
 developed
 something


called
 Borg
 naming
 service.
 So
 the
 BNS


um
 and
 that's
 because
 obviously
 like
 at


that
 point
 and
 very
 often
 you
 will
 you


know
 have
 a
 specific
 IP
 address
 and


specific
 ports.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 but
 Borg
 from
 the
 get-go
 was
 very


like
 well
 any
 anything
 can
 run
 anywhere.


So
 they
 wanted
 a
 level
 high
 of


abstraction
 higher
 than
 that.
 What
 Borg


does
 is
 that
 they
 allocate
 resources
 for


like
 jobs
 and
 memory
 and
 CPUs
 like


across
 machines.
 So
 the
 actual
 IP


address
 to
 the
 machines
 like
 it
 has
 to


happen
 fluidly
 because
 they
 don't


allocate
 specific
 machines.
 It's
 broader


than
 that.
 It's
 more
 like
 cluster
 level


and
 a
 cluster
 is
 like
 racks
 of
 machines.


>> Mhm.
 So
 they
 they
 needed
 that
 that


abstraction.
 They
 need
 a
 next
 level


outside
 of
 like
 you
 know
 what's
 a
 rack,


what's
 a
 cluster,
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


>> Exactly.
 Because
 it's
 like
 well
 we
 have


so
 many
 machines
 that
 it
 doesn't
 matter


and
 the
 machines
 again
 like
 because
 they


were
 especially
 in
 the
 beginning
 kind
 of


like
 cheap
 and
 easy.
 It's
 like
 we
 don't


like
 a
 machine
 will
 fail.
 We
 don't
 care.


We'll
 like
 another
 machine
 will
 come
 in


and
 take
 over.
 And
 similarly
 they
 built


out
 the
 Google
 file
 system
 back
 in
 2003


or
 well
 they
 talked
 about
 it
 in
 2003
 um


which
 was
 also
 necessary
 because
 of


that.
 So
 like
 a
 a
 huge
 decentralized


uh
 file
 system
 like
 in
 2003
 they
 had


hundreds
 of
 terabytes
 of
 storage
 across


thousands
 of
 discs
 and
 machines


accessible
 by
 hundreds
 of
 clients.
 It


had
 this
 like
 basically
 a
 storage
 stack


where
 you
 had
 discs
 like
 actual
 physical


hard
 drives
 and
 then
 an
 abstraction


called
 D
 above
 that
 for
 a
 disk
 but
 like


the
 disc
 could
 be
 either
 a
 disk
 or


something
 else.
 Uh
 and
 then
 you
 had
 the


like
 the
 Google
 file
 system
 on
 top
 of


that
 which
 was
 later
 preceded
 by


Colossus
 which
 is
 what
 they
 use
 now.
 And


then
 on
 top
 of
 that
 they
 built
 out
 all


of
 these
 like
 database
 like
 services.
 So


things
 like
 big
 table,
 like
 spanner,


like
 there's
 not
 just
 like
 the
 one


database
 because
 it
 depends
 obviously
 on


the
 uses
 of
 the
 database
 like
 what
 are


you
 optimizing
 for?
 And
 so
 internally


they
 have
 lots
 of
 different
 variables


and
 like
 kind
 of
 database
 systems
 as


well
 where
 they
 will
 have
 some
 of
 their


data
 centers
 u
 are
 like
 more


specifically
 for
 you
 know
 better
 for


certain
 type
 of
 data
 storage
 and
 certain


types
 of
 of
 database
 you
 know
 big
 table


is
 more
 nosql
 it's
 sparse
 it's


distributed
 it's
 persistent
 spanner
 you


have
 a
 more
 SQL
 like
 interface
 case
 it's


more
 important
 for
 like
 real
 consistency


across
 the
 world.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 guess
 the
 trade-offs
 are
 like


is
 it
 like
 write
 intensive,
 is
 it
 read


intensive,
 what
 kind
 of
 data
 are
 you


storing,
 like
 how
 structured
 does
 it


need
 to
 be,
 how
 are
 you
 wanting
 to


access
 it,
 right?
 So
 these
 are
 all
 the


differences
 between
 the
 the
 reasons
 they


they
 have
 and
 then
 like
 as
 you
 said
 the


distribution
 like
 like
 do
 you
 just
 want


it
 on
 one
 machine
 and
 if
 it
 dies
 totally


fine
 or
 you
 want
 guaranteed
 uh
 that
 it's


distributed
 then
 then
 do
 you
 want


consistency
 that
 immediately
 as
 soon
 as


you
 write
 is
 there
 but
 then
 there's
 a


latency
 or
 then
 you
 want
 to
 minimize


that
 or
 you
 don't
 care
 if
 it's


eventually
 consistent
 and
 then
 you
 can


write.
 So
 like
 there's
 a
 good
 question


of
 like
 why
 does
 Google
 have
 so
 many


databases
 and
 I
 guess
 this
 go
 back
 to


like
 why
 are
 there
 so
 many
 databases?


There's
 so
 many
 databases
 like
 we
 just


did
 on
 the
 pragmatic
 engineer
 survey.


There
 were
 so
 many
 like
 50
 plus
 or
 or


even
 more
 that
 people
 use
 and
 they're


all
 like
 built
 by
 like
 actually


experienced
 teams.
 That
 that's
 kind
 of


an
 interesting
 interesting
 side


question.
 Why
 so
 many
 databases?


>> Yeah,
 like
 databases
 optimize
 for


different
 things
 and
 so
 there's


different
 use
 cases
 for
 them.
 But
 one
 of


the
 things
 with
 Google
 from
 again
 fairly


early
 on,
 Google
 branched
 out
 and
 like


they
 didn't
 just
 focus
 on
 the
 one
 search


product,
 you
 know,
 they
 built
 out
 Gmail


which
 was
 basically
 email
 with
 built-in


spam
 filters
 was
 like
 the
 pitch
 from


early
 on
 as
 well
 as
 a
 gigabyte
 of


storage
 which
 was
 also
 unheard
 of
 at
 the


time.
 Uh
 and
 then
 they
 branched
 out
 into


you
 know
 Google
 calendar,
 Google
 Docs.


Um
 they
 did
 some
 really
 big
 and
 smart


acquisitions
 like
 YouTube,
 uh
 Android,


you
 know,
 they
 they
 had
 the
 the
 in
 tech


infrastructure
 that
 they
 had.
 Um
 and


then
 they
 started
 h
 getting
 all
 of
 these


new
 use
 cases,
 uh
 basically
 companies


operating
 on
 top
 of
 this
 stack.
 And
 so


they
 were
 able
 like
 had
 the
 needs,
 had


the
 expertise
 and
 had
 the
 data
 centers


and
 the
 infrastructure
 to
 build
 out
 all


of
 these
 different
 offerings
 uh
 for


their
 own
 products.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 this


is
 still
 happening,
 but
 they
 did


actually
 for
 a
 long
 time
 at
 least
 and


possibly
 still
 they
 also
 had
 backups
 for


all
 of
 their
 data
 service
 uh
 data


centers
 on
 physical
 tape.


>> Wow.
 I
 mean
 ta
 t t t t t t t t t t t t t


t t t t t t t
 t t t t t t t t t t t t t


t t t t t t t
 durable.
 So


>> yeah,
 there
 are
 uh
 in
 the
 SRV
 book
 which


was
 published
 in
 I
 want
 to
 say
 2015
 2016


which
 is
 available
 online.
 You
 can
 read


it
 online.
 They
 have
 some
 amazing


stories
 of
 some
 like
 huge
 outages
 in


2011
 and
 2012
 from
 Gmail
 and
 the
 Gmail


one
 in
 particular,
 there
 was
 a
 bug
 and


they
 lost
 like
 0.2%
 2%
 of
 users
 logged


in
 and
 like
 there
 was
 nothing
 in
 their


inbox
 because
 they
 lost
 all
 their
 data.


And
 they
 wrote
 like
 an
 incident
 report


saying
 like
 this
 is
 what
 was
 going
 on


and
 they
 talked
 about
 how
 they
 were
 able


to
 restore
 the
 data
 and
 they
 went
 into


what
 they
 called
 Gtape


>> which
 was
 their
 physical
 tape
 gape


>> and
 they
 spent
 a
 couple
 days
 manually


going
 through
 the
 tapes
 to
 restore
 the


data
 to
 the
 users.
 There's
 this
 article


published
 by
 Google
 called
 10
 things
 we


know
 to
 be
 true.
 It's
 a
 set
 of
 beliefs


that
 they
 published
 when
 the
 company
 was


just
 a
 few
 years
 old.
 And
 what
 surprised


me
 is
 how
 many
 of
 these
 are
 still
 true


today.
 Did
 you
 read
 this
 article?


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 the
 fast
 is
 better
 than


slow
 which
 was
 a
 defining
 part
 of
 the


culture
 and
 one
 of
 the
 core
 tenants
 for


their
 product
 which
 was
 search
 at
 the


time.


>> Yeah.
 And
 if
 anything,
 that
 obsession


with
 speed,
 it's
 become
 even
 more


critical
 today
 given
 how
 competitive
 the


market
 feels
 right
 now.


>> Yeah,
 for
 sure.
 Actually,
 when
 we
 worked


on
 the
 what's
 in
 your
 tech
 stack
 survey


that
 we
 worked
 on
 a
 few
 months
 ago,
 one


of
 the
 most
 mentioned
 words
 that


engineers
 used
 when
 talking
 about


tooling
 that
 they
 dislike
 was
 slow.


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 the
 number
 one.
 It's


pretty
 clear
 that
 that
 engineers
 or
 or


even
 teams
 that
 are
 faster
 than
 their


competition
 and
 are
 quick
 to
 make


decisions,
 they
 use
 tools
 that
 are
 also


fast
 in
 how
 they
 manage
 their
 work.
 And


all
 of
 this
 brings
 us
 nicely
 to
 our


season
 sponsor,
 Linear.
 Linear
 actually


dominated
 the
 project
 management


responses.
 This
 survey
 as
 a
 tool
 that


techies
 love
 using
 it.
 In
 fact,
 it
 was


the
 most
 loved
 project
 management
 tool.


It
 wasn't
 even
 close.
 From
 the


responses,
 it
 was
 clear
 that
 the
 big


part
 of
 this
 was
 due
 to
 how
 fast
 Linear


is
 to
 use.
 Right
 after
 we
 posted
 a


survey
 results,
 Linear
 reached
 out


wanting
 to
 work
 together,
 and
 it
 was a


super
 easy ACS.
 I've
 since
 been
 talking


with
 the
 Linear
 team
 about
 how
 OpenAI


and
 Perplexity
 switched
 to
 Linear.
 And
 a


big
 reason
 for
 these
 companies
 to
 move


was
 how
 Linear
 enables
 velocity
 in
 their


product
 workflows.
 I'll
 actually
 link


the
 OpenAI
 story
 in
 the
 show
 notes
 below


because
 it's
 such
 an
 interesting
 read.


And
 yeah,
 I
 guess
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 a


thing
 that
 Google
 understood
 very
 early


on
 that
 when
 you
 focus
 and
 prioritize


speed
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 you
 operate,
 every


piece
 of
 your
 stack
 needs
 to
 support


that.


>> Totally.
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 spending
 more


time
 with
 the
 Lunar
 team
 over
 the
 coming


months
 and
 I'm
 excited
 to
 share
 more


about
 the
 product
 and
 the
 story
 behind


the
 company.
 If
 you're
 curious
 to
 get
 a


feel
 for
 the
 product
 yourself,
 head
 over


to
 linear.app/pragmatic.


And
 then
 outside
 of
 just
 infrastructure,


like
 Google
 has
 so
 many
 other


custom
 systems.
 I
 I'll
 just
 name
 a
 few


cuz
 I
 I
 think
 like
 it's
 we
 could
 take


forever
 in
 going
 into
 them,
 but
 instead


of
 instead
 of
 GitHub,
 you
 know,
 for


source
 control,
 they
 they
 use
 Piper,


something
 called
 Piper.
 That's
 their


version
 control
 system.
 instead
 of
 pull


requests
 they
 they
 have
 this
 thing


called
 DL
 change
 list
 uh
 for
 their
 code


review
 tools
 called
 critique
 uh
 and
 it's


integrated
 with
 so
 many
 other
 tools
 that


they
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 AI
 function
 now
 built


into
 it
 it's
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 like


GitHub's
 poll
 request
 review
 uh
 code


search
 has
 been
 a
 very
 kind
 of
 famous


tool
 that
 that
 inspires
 source
 graph
 uh


so
 you
 can
 you
 can
 search
 all
 of


Google's
 repositories
 and
 again
 they


they
 they
 do
 have
 a
 monor
 repo
 but
 they


have
 incredible
 amounts
 of
 of
 code
 and


it
 it's
 it's
 rapid.
 It's
 again
 it's
 from


a
 search
 company
 you
 wouldn't
 expect


anything
 less
 but
 apparently
 for
 a
 long


time
 when
 I
 talk
 with
 source
 graph


founders
 they
 were
 saying
 that
 code


search
 is
 was
 they
 had
 parts
 that
 were


better
 than
 source
 graph's
 own
 offering


I
 think
 now
 source
 graph
 is
 is
 catching


up
 but
 I
 still
 remember
 when
 I
 first


used
 source
 graph
 at
 Uber
 and
 it
 was


just
 so
 fast
 and
 I
 was
 like
 wow
 this
 is


so
 so
 cool
 to
 use
 but
 apparently
 that


that's
 the
 norm
 at
 Google
 and
 most


companies
 never
 had
 this
 until
 you
 know


maybe
 maybe
 they
 tried
 to
 build
 it
 for


themselves
 but
 it
 it
 wouldn't
 be
 worth


it
 building
 for
 for
 your
 own.
 Yeah.
 And


a
 lot
 of
 that
 actually
 comes
 from
 the


fact
 that
 they
 have
 this
 monor
 repo.
 So


the
 monor
 repo,
 they
 talked
 about
 it


publicly
 first
 in
 like
 2015.
 They


started
 publishing
 numbers
 on
 it.
 Back


in
 2015,
 there
 were
 already
 a
 billion


files
 in
 the
 monor
 repo.
 Two
 billion


lines
 of
 source
 code.
 It
 was
 86


terabytes
 of
 content
 with
 40,000
 commits


every
 single
 day.
 It's
 interesting


because
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 they
 were


able
 to
 build
 the
 monor
 repo
 and
 operate


it
 the
 way
 they
 did
 was
 also
 because


they
 built
 it
 on
 the
 Google


infrastructure
 that
 they
 already
 have.


So
 the
 data
 centers
 and
 networking
 they


built
 out
 their
 um
 no
 build
 tool
 blaze


>> blaze
 which
 which
 they
 open
 source
 a


thing
 called
 basil
 which
 is
 similar


enough
 which
 is
 also
 really
 really
 fast


and
 really
 good.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it's
 you
 know
 this
 distributed


build
 system
 that
 yeah
 it's
 kind
 of
 core


of
 how
 like
 it's
 core
 of
 how
 they
 build


u
 it's
 very
 distributed
 very
 quickly.
 It


enables
 the
 monor
 repo
 in
 in
 the


ridiculous
 scale
 it's
 at,
 but
 it's
 also


deeply
 ingrained
 into
 how
 they
 do
 the


development
 itself,
 which
 is
 very
 in
 the


cloud
 actually.
 like
 most
 Googlers
 will


not
 have
 code
 locally
 on
 their
 machines


and
 kind
 of
 haven't
 uh
 ever
 it's
 kind
 of


a
 system
 uh
 called
 clients
 in
 the
 cloud


or
 sitsy
 uh
 which
 is
 the
 way
 they


they're
 programming
 which
 is
 yeah
 like


not
 on
 device
 but
 you
 know
 connect
 to


clients
 in
 the
 cloud
 these
 days
 it
 seems


like
 they
 they
 mostly
 do
 that
 through
 a


tool
 called
 cider
 which
 is
 actually
 a
 a


fork
 of
 VS
 Code


>> well
 now
 now
 it
 is
 right.
 It
 used
 to
 not


be


>> it
 used
 Yeah,
 it
 used
 to
 be
 something


else.


>> It
 used
 to
 be
 a
 web-
 based
 tool.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 I
 used
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 when
 I


was
 interning
 there
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 like


back
 then
 it
 felt
 kind
 of
 niche,
 but


then
 I
 think
 that's
 uh
 changed
 a
 lot.
 I


guess
 partially
 since
 forking
 VS
 Code,


I'm
 I
 bet
 it's
 it's
 looking
 much
 nicer


than
 it
 did
 when
 I
 was
 there.


>> I
 I
 hear
 a
 lot
 more
 people
 are
 using
 it.


So,
 yeah.
 again
 like
 because
 everything


is
 custom
 everything
 is
 also
 so


connected.
 So
 like
 cider
 is
 deeply


integrated
 into
 critique
 that
 they
 use


for
 code
 reviews
 which
 is
 deeply


integrated
 to
 their
 CI
 tap
 uh
 test


automation


uh
 program.
 They
 have
 tools
 like
 try


quarter
 which
 runs
 tests
 static
 analysis


all
 that
 stuff.
 They
 actually
 speaking


of
 rapid
 they
 actually
 have
 uh
 their


release
 automation
 tool
 is
 called
 rapid


or
 one
 of
 them
 rather
 code
 search
 is


integrated
 into
 all
 of
 that
 as
 well
 and


obviously
 code
 search
 is
 you
 know
 like


they
 had
 to
 build
 that
 out
 because
 the


monor
 repo
 was
 so
 huge


>> speaking
 of
 like
 like
 working
 together


or
 how
 they
 work
 like
 you
 know
 when
 you


think
 of
 Google's
 like
 what
 they
 use
 for


project
 management
 you
 know
 their
 kind


of
 version
 of
 grs
 linear
 they
 have


buganized


again
 a
 custom
 tool
 and
 they
 have
 this


tool
 called
 task
 flow
 which
 is
 a
 UI
 on


top
 of
 buganizer
 for
 boards
 cambban
 and


other
 kind
 of
 management
 tooling
 and


then
 they
 have
 guts
 which
 is
 Google


universal
 ticketing
 system
 it's
 was
 more


for
 for
 tech
 related
 tech
 support
 when


you
 open
 like
 a
 ticket
 you
 know
 you
 can


think
 of
 it
 like
 zenesk
 or
 like
 juro


tickets
 or
 or
 or
 just
 any
 ticketing


system
 but
 it's
 so
 interesting
 how
 they


even
 built
 that
 for
 themselves
 as
 well


>> but
 it's
 also
 it
 makes
 sense
 because
 I
 I


guess
 when
 you
 have
 the
 infrastructure


so
 unique
 it's
 like
 well
 you
 need
 to


implement
 this
 so
 where
 does
 that
 goes


come
 in
 and
 actually
 I
 think
 buganizer


in
 particular
 is
 also
 probably
 the


integration
 with
 cider
 and
 critique
 and


but
 like
 because
 everything
 is
 so
 custom


everything
 is
 like
 made
 for
 each
 other


as
 well.
 So
 using
 buganizer,
 you
 know,


you
 can
 report
 but
 also
 like
 fix
 do


small
 fixes
 like
 immediately
 in


the
 same
 environment
 that
 you're
 already


in
 because
 it's
 it's
 using
 the
 same


infrastructure.


>> Yeah.
 Now,
 one
 interesting
 thing
 about


Google
 that
 I
 I
 hear
 is
 this
 kind
 of


tech
 island.
 I
 I
 I
 think
 longtime
 Google


engineer
 or
 executive
 Ursera
 might
 have


said
 this.
 Google
 is
 is
 a
 tech
 island


like
 there's
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 world
 which


is
 using
 you
 know
 pretty
 standardized


things
 like
 most
 startups
 will
 be
 using


like
 you
 know
 like
 a
 AWS
 tooling
 or
 for


containers
 it'll
 be
 kubernetes
 or
 for


front-end
 frameworks
 with
 like
 react
 or


uh
 and
 and
 like
 for
 database
 it'll
 be


postgress
 or
 or
 something
 that
 is
 out


there
 but
 for
 Google
 everything
 is
 uh


separate
 and
 there
 was
 this
 recognition


even
 inside
 Google
 that
 this
 could
 be
 a


problem
 that
 they're
 so
 unique
 that
 they


cannot
 take
 advantage
 of
 other
 open-


source
 projects
 for
 example
 developing


but
 but
 also
 it's
 it's
 a
 very
 expensive


to
 on
 board
 it's
 just
 for
 new
 joiners


you
 know
 they
 have
 to
 throw
 away
 every


knowledge
 and
 at
 some
 point
 it
 might


also
 be
 maybe
 just
 not
 as
 tempting
 to
 go


work
 at
 Google
 if
 you
 know
 that
 whatever


you
 use
 there
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be


useful
 for
 you
 know
 your
 your
 next
 job


but
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 has
 changed
 I


think
 Google
 is
 like
 nah
 you
 know
 like


they
 probably
 talked
 a
 little
 bit
 about


it
 but
 and
 maybe
 it
 cannot
 even
 change


that
 much
 because
 it
 it
 didn't
 start


because
 Google
 it
 didn't
 feel
 doesn't


feel
 to
 me
 that
 it
 started
 because


Google
 said
 like
 no
 we
 need
 to
 do


something
 different.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think
 it's
 more
 like
 like
 we've


been
 talking
 about
 like
 they
 kind
 of
 had


to
 do
 something
 different
 from
 the


get-go.
 And
 I
 think
 when
 you
 end
 up
 in
 a


situation
 where
 basically
 you've


invented
 your
 entire
 own
 kind
 of


internet
 or
 like
 way
 of
 communicating


across
 computers
 like
 from
 the
 ground
 up


and
 you
 build
 out
 stuff
 on
 top
 of
 that


like
 yeah
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 even
 know
 if


it's
 possible
 for
 them
 to
 move
 over
 and


that's
 actually
 so
 when
 they
 started
 GCP


the
 Google
 cloud
 platform
 you
 know
 uh
 a


lot
 of
 that
 is
 what
 they
 refer
 to
 as


external
 izing.
 So
 they're


externalizing.
 They're
 not
 open
 sourcing


because
 it's
 still
 like
 they're
 on
 their


own
 tech
 stack,
 but
 they
 are


externalizing.
 So
 making
 offers
 that,


you
 know,
 can
 be
 used
 by
 other


companies.
 So
 Kubernetes
 is
 the


externalized
 version
 of
 Borg
 and
 it's


not
 the
 same,
 but
 it's,
 you
 know,


heavily
 inspired
 by
 it.
 Like
 slightly


different
 architecture,
 slightly


different
 feature
 set
 because
 it's
 it


doesn't
 have
 to
 cater
 to
 to
 just
 Google.


And
 the
 same
 for
 you
 know
 big
 table


spanner


yeah
 basically
 everything
 in
 the
 in
 the


Google
 cloud
 platform
 and
 act
 actually


also
 to
 mention
 gRPC
 gRPC
 which
 is
 a
 way


of
 communicating
 across
 services
 that
 is


something
 that
 is
 also
 externalized
 uh


internally
 it's
 called
 stubby
 and
 that


is
 the
 way
 that
 they
 communicate
 across


services
 and
 it's
 yeah
 it's
 the


internalized


um
 gRPC


they
 use
 protobuff
 as
 like
 the
 messages


for
 how
 to
 communicate
 across
 services


and
 then
 gRPC
 is
 the
 way
 they
 do
 that.


>> Yeah.
 All
 all
 this
 internal
 tooling
 I
 I


think
 like
 for
 a
 feedback
 I
 I
 often
 hear


from
 people
 going
 to
 Google
 is
 how


they're
 just
 really
 surprised
 at
 how
 it


is.
 And
 of
 course
 people
 who've
 been


there
 for
 long
 enough
 they
 gotten
 used


to
 it
 when
 they
 go
 outside
 they're
 often


really
 kind
 of
 taken
 aback
 by
 how
 little


other
 companies
 have
 it.
 For
 example,
 if


you
 spend
 most
 of
 your
 career
 at
 Google


and
 move
 to
 any
 other
 other
 company,


like
 often
 Googlers
 will
 look
 for
 the


equivalent
 of
 like
 whatever
 Google
 tool


had
 at
 this
 company
 which
 might
 or
 might


not
 not not
 exist.
 But
 there
 was
 uh
 this


uh
 person
 neat
 code
 as
 his
 name
 is


Namadiv
 Singh
 who
 uh
 well
 he
 he
 creates


uh
 one
 of
 the
 most
 popular
 coding


solutions.
 He
 worked
 at
 Google
 for
 I


think
 about
 a
 year
 and
 he
 said
 he
 did
 a


video
 about
 the
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 things


about
 Google
 and
 he
 he
 said
 how
 it's
 too


many
 internal
 tools
 and
 what
 he
 said
 is


I'm
 quoting
 him.
 Google
 has
 this
 problem


that
 they
 have
 an
 internal
 tool
 for


literally
 everything.
 So
 and
 sometimes


all
 those
 internal
 tools
 don't
 have


massive
 teams
 supporting
 them.
 Sometimes


it's
 just
 one
 guy
 working
 on
 an
 internal


tool
 trying
 to
 get
 promoted
 that
 maybe


they
 get
 promoted
 and
 then
 they
 stop


maintaining
 that
 tool
 and
 now
 you're


used
 to
 forced
 to
 use
 it
 and
 then
 nobody


knows
 how
 to
 fix
 a
 bug.
 You
 have
 to
 go


and
 read
 the
 code
 and
 you
 have
 to
 fix
 it


yourselves
 and
 that's
 not
 fun.
 No
 one


enjoys
 that.
 And
 then
 he
 said
 I
 would


rather
 not
 have
 this
 internal
 tool
 in


the
 first
 place
 because
 at
 least
 I
 can


just
 solve
 the
 problem
 from
 scratch
 but


now
 that
 is
 there
 I
 need
 to
 use
 this


internal
 tool.
 So
 I
 think
 it
 can
 get
 out


of
 hand
 and
 sounds
 like
 a
 Google


sometimes
 gets
 out
 of
 hand
 and
 he
 was


specifically
 saying
 his
 problem
 is
 not


with
 the
 big
 tools
 like
 Borg
 that
 are


really
 wellmaintained
 really
 well


written
 but
 there's
 it's
 just


everywhere.
 So
 it's
 and
 because
 of
 this


uh
 as
 I
 understand
 you
 know
 Google
 has


so
 many
 migrations
 going
 on
 all
 the
 time


especially
 you
 know
 pro
 promotions
 come


into
 play
 which
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 shortly
 but
 let
 me
 show
 you
 this


image
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Google
 they
 there


there's
 this
 like
 two
 two
 things
 to


choose
 there's
 the
 the
 main
 thing
 that's


deprecated
 don't
 even
 think
 about
 it
 the


new
 thing
 that
 is
 under
 construction
 and


this
 is
 by
 by
 Manu
 uh
 Cornet
 who
 worked


there
 for
 I
 think
 12
 years
 and
 he
 was


saying
 that
 by
 the
 way
 this
 is
 true
 for


a
 lot
 of
 tech
 companies
 but
 especially


Google.
 So
 let's
 talk
 about
 how
 Google


works.
 Now
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 kind
 of


think
 about
 like
 when
 I
 you
 know
 people


think
 like
 oh
 what
 do
 you
 know
 about


Google
 even
 as
 engineers
 it's
 it's
 about


the
 perks
 right
 like
 they're
 they're


just
 so
 known
 for
 for
 the
 perks


especially
 if
 you
 visit
 a
 friend
 at


Google
 I
 mean
 it's
 the
 thing
 that
 stands


out
 right
 I
 think
 the
 the
 micro
 kitchens


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 the
 Google
 offices
 in


general
 are
 I
 mean
 I've
 been
 to
 other


big
 tech
 offices
 as
 well
 and
 like
 I
 mean


the
 the
 kind
 of
 playfulness
 and


quirkiness
 is
 definitely
 not
 unique
 to


Google,
 but
 it's
 also
 unique
 to
 Google.


Um,


>> it's
 unique
 to
 Google.


>> If
 if
 you
 have
 the
 chance
 to
 go
 visit
 a


Google
 office,
 especially
 one
 of
 the


bigger
 ones,
 do
 it.
 It's
 It's
 a
 fun


time.


>> Yeah,
 they
 people
 can
 bring
 in
 visitors.


You
 you
 get
 like
 free
 lunch
 or
 breakfast


or
 or
 whatever
 dinner
 probably
 as
 well.


And
 I
 mean,
 the
 decor
 is
 unique
 like
 you


know
 like
 I
 I've
 been
 to
 many
 offices,


right?
 Like
 obviously
 what
 worked
 at


Uber
 but
 went
 to
 Meta,
 Spotify,


etc.
 like
 and
 they
 all
 have
 like
 cool


decor
 at
 places,
 but
 Google
 is


everywhere.
 Like
 the
 thing
 that
 reminds


me
 the
 most
 of
 of
 Google
 is
 the
 old


Facebook
 office
 back
 in
 in
 Menlo
 Park


back
 when
 it
 was
 like
 still
 very
 very


like
 heavily
 invested.
 There
 was
 like


such
 cool
 cool
 things.
 That
 was
 the
 only


thing
 that
 came
 close
 and
 I'm
 pretty


sure
 they
 kind
 of
 modeled
 it
 partially


after
 Google
 to
 wanting
 to
 hire,
 you


know,
 like
 similar
 people.
 But
 yeah,


like
 like
 really
 unique
 decor
 every


office
 like
 I
 think
 in
 Amsterdam
 there's


a
 van
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 of
 the
 office


which
 is
 a
 meeting
 room
 which
 apparently


people
 don't
 use
 because
 it's
 too
 hot


but
 it
 looks
 really
 cool
 and
 and
 that's


just
 many
 one
 of
 the
 many
 decors.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 those
 are
 very
 they're


quirky.
 They're
 location
 based.
 They're


kind
 of
 theme
 based.
 So
 yeah,
 the
 micro


kitchens,
 a
 micro
 kitchen
 is
 basically


like
 a
 space
 in
 the
 office
 where
 you
 can


get
 free
 snacks
 and
 coffee
 and
 tea
 and


and
 and
 just
 like
 often
 just
 like
 a
 a


nice
 little
 like
 chill
 break
 room
 where


you
 can
 socialize
 and
 hang
 out
 with


people.
 Yeah,
 there's
 just
 so
 much


personality
 to
 them.
 In
 in
 the
 Zurich


office,
 they
 have
 one
 with
 a
 one
 of


those
 like
 secret
 bookcase
 doors.
 So,


like
 you'll
 be
 in
 this
 micro
 kitchen


that
 looks
 like
 a
 a
 library
 basically


with
 these
 huge
 book
 uh
 bookcases
 and


one
 of
 them
 opens
 up
 to
 like
 a
 secret


room
 in
 the
 back.
 When
 I
 was
 in
 the


London
 office
 back
 in
 2015,
 they
 had
 you


know
 the
 London
 phone
 boxes.


They
 had
 tons
 of
 those
 across
 the
 the


offices
 whereas
 like
 you
 you
 know
 you


can
 go
 in
 and
 like
 do
 a
 quick
 call
 or


like
 a
 oneperson
 meeting
 room.
 They
 had


uh
 London
 buses,


you
 know,
 just
 a
 London
 bus
 just
 in
 the


office
 that
 you
 could
 go
 in
 and
 hang
 out


in.
 They're
 really
 fun,
 very
 colorful.
 I


mean,
 Google
 has
 always
 been
 colorful


given
 that
 they
 choy
 chose
 like
 the
 bold


colors
 in
 the
 logo
 from
 early
 on.
 And


yeah,
 you
 can
 just
 you
 can
 tell
 like


those
 little
 caps
 with
 the
 propellers
 on


the
 Nler
 hats,
 which
 I
 did
 have,
 but
 it


broke
 and
 I
 have
 lost
 it
 somewhere.
 And


then
 like
 I
 think
 the
 perk
 the
 list
 of


perks
 is
 really
 long.
 I
 mean
 it
 keeps


changing
 per
 per
 location
 but
 there'll


be
 like
 you
 know
 from
 the
 usual
 kind
 of


in
 the
 US
 the
 40k
 on
 matching
 which
 is


kind
 of
 a
 given
 but
 still
 generous
 from


like
 all
 sorts
 of
 allowances
 that
 you


can
 spend
 on
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 like


typically
 you
 can
 expense
 a
 bunch
 of


things
 the
 travel
 that
 that
 you
 can


travel
 usually
 don't
 need
 a
 budget.
 I


mean
 it's
 it's
 changing
 over
 time
 and


again
 this
 is
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 by


location.
 And
 then
 there
 used
 to
 be
 like


more
 historic
 perks
 that
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


think
 exists,
 but
 there
 used
 to
 be
 like


on-site
 massages
 where
 you
 can
 get
 like


like
 uh
 like
 you
 know
 like
 like
 mass


would
 come
 in
 and
 like
 you
 could
 just


get
 it
 in
 the
 office
 which
 was
 very


famous
 in
 the
 in
 the
 like
 2000s
 or
 or
 so


to
 like
 the
 napping
 pots
 to
 some
 of


these
 things.
 But
 these
 keep
 changing.


But
 I
 think
 one
 thing
 that
 hasn't


changed
 is
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 the


biggest
 perk
 of
 all
 is
 the
 compensation


package
 which
 is
 just
 like
 wow.
 like
 you


know
 there's
 this
 trrimodal
 model
 of
 of


like
 the
 the
 local
 companies
 that
 that


that
 compete
 locally
 and
 companies
 that


like
 try
 to
 pay
 the
 top
 of
 the
 local


market
 and
 companies
 that
 pay
 the
 top
 of


the
 regional
 market
 that's
 a
 top
 tier


Google
 is
 is
 a
 very
 top
 tier
 company


which
 means
 that
 they
 can
 pay
 anywhere


from
 two
 to
 four
 times
 the
 compensation


so
 the
 total
 compensation
 that
 other


similar
 companies
 would
 pay
 let's
 say


for
 a
 senior
 software
 engineer
 and
 like


what
 this
 means
 in
 terms
 of
 numbers
 is


in
 Silicon
 Alley
 uh
 of
 California,
 a


senior
 software
 engineer
 could
 make


around
 $4500,000


per
 year
 in
 total
 composation,
 which


means,
 and
 this
 is
 where
 like
 it
 gets


interesting,
 there's
 a
 base
 salary,


there's
 a
 stock
 that
 vests
 per
 year
 that


you
 can
 sell
 because
 it's
 liquid
 stock,


and
 then
 there's
 a
 cash
 bonus.
 And
 then


this
 will
 be
 something
 for
 a
 senior


software
 engineer
 in
 the
 US
 like
 220,000


uh
 in
 in
 California
 base
 salary
 maybe


200,000
 per
 year
 in
 stock
 and
 maybe


$35,000
 in
 target
 bonus
 and
 these
 last


two
 they
 can
 change
 based
 on
 your


performance
 you
 could
 get
 more
 you
 could


get
 less
 but
 for
 for
 London
 this
 whole


total
 compensation
 package
 which
 is
 not


all
 salary
 so
 salary
 is
 only
 one
 part
 of


it
 it
 will
 be
 for
 senior
 software


engineer
 will
 be
 something
 like
 200
 to


250,000


pounds.
 In
 in
 Munich,
 uh
 it
 will
 be


somewhere
 to€190
 to€
 220,000


and
 in
 in
 Turk
 it
 will
 be
 300
 to€330,000


which
 is
 like
 a
 big
 jump
 again


differences
 in
 taxes
 and
 areas
 and
 and


again
 for
 every
 other
 location
 in
 in


India
 and
 in
 in
 Sydney
 etc
 they
 will


just
 typically
 pay
 more
 than
 anyone
 can


offer.
 So
 typically
 the
 best
 paying


opportunities
 they
 will
 shoot
 a
 little


bit
 above
 and
 in
 the
 case
 that
 someone


pays
 more
 and
 Google
 really
 wants
 you,


they
 will
 sometimes
 shoot
 more
 and
 and


offer
 you
 more
 if
 they
 really
 want
 you.


In
 many
 ways,
 Google
 feels
 like
 this


amazing
 like
 you
 get
 everything.
 You
 get


to
 work
 on
 the
 largest
 scale
 things
 with


smart
 people,
 these
 amazing
 perks,
 and


you've
 been
 paid
 a
 bunch
 because
 a


company
 that
 does
 pay
 you
 pretty
 well,


not
 this
 well,
 but
 they
 pay
 you
 pretty


well
 is
 Amazon.
 They
 give
 you
 a
 very


respectable
 total
 compensation
 with


pretty
 good
 stock
 and
 cash
 and
 all
 that,


but
 then
 you
 get
 nothing.
 Like
 there


there's
 no
 perks.
 There's
 no
 nothing.


They're
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 you
 want
 to


go
 out
 for
 a
 team
 dinner,
 pay
 for


yourself.
 Whereas
 at
 Google,
 like
 this


is
 not
 even
 a
 question.
 Like,
 you
 know,


like
 there
 will
 be
 team
 events
 and
 and


of
 course
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 pay
 for


it.


>> No,
 exactly.
 Like
 they
 they
 take
 good


care
 of
 their
 engineers
 and
 have
 done


again
 like
 from
 day
 one
 basically.
 And


and
 speaking
 of
 good
 care,
 so
 like
 one


thing
 that
 really
 kind
 of
 struck
 me
 as


really
 really
 unique
 is
 on
 call
 almost


every
 company
 is
 like
 let's
 be
 real
 like


engineers
 are
 paid
 really
 well
 at
 at


Google
 and
 similarly
 well
 at
 Amazon,


Meta,
 Microsoft
 at
 all
 the
 other


companies
 you
 are
 expected
 to
 when


you're
 on
 a
 team
 you
 share
 the
 on
 call


on
 your
 team.
 Now,
 in
 the
 case
 of


Google,
 on
 call
 is
 not
 nearly
 as


enforced
 or
 as
 stressful
 as
 at
 every


other
 company.
 At
 every
 other
 company,


you
 join
 like
 a
 six
 person
 team.
 You'll


probably
 have
 a
 rotation
 of
 of
 every
 six


weeks.
 Uh
 it
 might
 be
 a
 bad
 rotation.
 It


might
 be
 a
 good
 rotation.
 If
 it's
 a
 bad


rotation,
 well,
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 your


nights
 will
 be
 disrupted.
 Sorry.
 Until


your
 team
 gets
 this
 stuff
 together.
 So,


Google
 has
 a
 a
 few
 things.
 First
 of
 all,


they
 have
 an
 SRE
 organization
 which


works
 really
 hard
 to
 make
 on
 call
 less


painful
 for
 teams.
 They
 build
 tooling


that
 helps
 with
 this.
 Uh
 they
 monitor


the
 the
 load
 of
 the
 teams
 and
 they
 have


this
 thing
 called
 toil
 SLOs's
 toil


service
 level
 objectives
 where
 they
 want


to
 make
 sure
 that
 that
 teams
 whose


SLOs's
 are
 are
 breached,
 they
 stop


production
 work
 and
 fix
 the
 underlying


issues.
 So
 they
 basically
 provide
 time


for
 teams
 to
 become
 healthy
 again
 and


you
 know
 not
 get
 woken
 up
 all
 the
 time


at
 night
 by
 systems
 that
 break
 which


which
 happens
 a
 lot
 actually
 at
 some
 of


these
 other
 places
 that
 again
 have
 high


expectations
 similar
 to
 Google.
 And
 then


another
 interesting
 thing
 that
 Google


has
 this
 thing
 called
 on
 call
 tiers.
 So


at
 most
 companies
 even
 at
 big
 tech
 every


team
 just
 makes
 sure
 their
 systems
 are


up.
 Google
 assigns
 tiers
 to
 their


services.
 Uh
 tier
 one
 means
 that
 a
 page


that
 comes
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 acknowledged


in
 5
 minutes,
 tier
 2
 in
 30
 minutes
 and


tier
 three
 is
 best
 effort.
 So
 you
 can


imagine
 tier
 three
 is
 internal
 services,


tier
 one
 is
 important
 services,
 but
 then


they
 pay
 for
 the
 on
 call
 accordingly.
 So


they
 say
 if
 your
 if
 your
 team
 owns
 a


tier
 one
 service
 and
 you're
 on
 call,
 you


get
 66%
 of
 your
 normal
 salary.
 like
 if


if
 you
 would
 have
 been
 on
 call
 for
 the


whole
 month
 which
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be


on
 call
 you
 you
 can
 either
 choose


vacation
 or
 pay
 like
 40
 minutes
 of
 your


time
 for
 every
 hour.
 So
 anyway
 they
 they


do
 a
 bunch
 of
 composite
 they
 pay
 really


well
 for
 being
 on
 call
 and
 then
 they


limit
 time
 spent
 on
 call
 at
 the
 same


time.
 You
 cannot
 go
 for
 on
 call
 for
 more


than
 two
 weeks
 per
 quarter
 which
 is


going
 to
 less
 than
 other
 companies.
 So


it
 just
 like
 it
 it
 like
 mind-b
 blown


like
 Google
 all
 does
 all
 these
 things.


They
 pay
 engineers
 like
 best
 in
 the


industry
 or
 close
 to
 best
 in
 the


industry.
 They
 give
 all
 these
 perks
 and


then
 they
 relieve
 them
 from
 on
 call.
 So


it's
 almost
 like
 it's
 it's
 it's
 amazing


to
 to
 be
 and
 then
 not
 just
 relieve
 but


they
 actively
 help
 and
 mandate
 teams
 to


make
 their
 systems
 better.
 So
 this
 is


like
 paradise
 for
 an
 engineer.
 Like
 so


far
 like
 you
 would
 almost
 think
 that


Google's
 paying
 us
 to
 like
 advertise


them,
 but
 they're
 they're
 not.


>> No,
 they
 make
 it
 easy.
 But
 I
 guess


>> where's
 the
 catch?
 I
 mean,
 given
 what


we've
 been
 talking
 about
 though
 in
 terms


of
 like
 Google
 being
 this
 tech
 island,
 I


guess
 like
 this
 is
 the
 positive
 side
 of


it
 because
 like
 you
 can't
 actually
 fix


everything
 yourself
 because
 everything


is
 custom.
 So
 like
 you
 can't
 put
 the


expectation
 that
 everyone
 can
 go
 and
 fix


their
 Kubernetes
 pots
 or
 whatever.
 Like


this
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 trade-off.
 So
 it's


like
 you
 get
 this
 because
 you
 work
 with


the
 unique
 tech
 stack
 that
 is
 not


transferable
 outside
 of
 Google


>> and
 because
 they
 invested
 this
 much
 in


it.
 Exactly.
 If
 you
 work
 at
 Google,
 uh


you'll
 likely
 be


an
 SWE,
 the
 software
 engineer.
 That's


the
 big
 role
 that
 Google
 has.
 Um
 but


Google
 also
 has
 tons
 of
 like
 there
 are
 a


lot
 of
 other
 types
 of
 roles
 and
 niche


roles
 as
 well.
 Like
 S
 is
 obviously
 one


of
 the
 bigger
 niche
 ones
 run
 that
 they


have.
 Uh
 but
 there's
 also
 quite
 a
 lot
 of


other
 smaller
 ladders
 that
 and
 and
 roles


that
 they
 have
 depending
 on
 you
 know


like
 some
 roles
 are
 more
 prevalent
 in


some
 parts
 of
 the
 organization
 and
 with


some
 products
 or
 product
 areas.
 So


you'll
 have
 stuff
 like
 Debrell,
 they


have
 UX
 engineers
 which
 are
 kind
 of
 like


more
 front-end
 engineers
 working
 more


with
 design
 implementation
 and
 that
 that


there's
 like
 a
 scale
 there
 that
 goes


from
 more
 like
 front-end
 engineer
 to


prototyper
 which
 is
 a
 separate
 career


ladder.
 They
 have
 research
 scientists,


they
 have
 within
 the
 sur
 there's
 also


like
 more
 specific
 type
 of
 roles
 and


working
 with
 the
 infrastructure.


They
 have
 tons
 of
 other
 roles,
 but
 the


big
 one
 and
 the
 most
 on
 paper
 apparently


all
 of
 these
 different
 ladders
 are


supposed
 to
 have,
 you
 know,
 like
 same


compensation,
 same
 prestige,
 same


everything.
 But
 it
 seems
 like
 in
 reality


the
 SW
 role
 is
 good,
 kind
 of
 a
 bit
 like


higher
 class
 essentially.
 Uh,
 and
 part


of
 that
 is
 because
 when
 you're
 in
 SW,


like
 because
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 default


go-to
 role,
 that's
 the
 one
 where
 you


have
 the
 most
 internal
 mobility,
 you
 can


work
 on
 like
 any
 team,
 you
 like
 it's


much
 easier
 to
 like
 move
 somewhere
 else


because
 that's
 the
 default
 that


engineering
 managers
 will
 look
 for
 and


hire
 for.
 And
 speaking
 of
 managers,
 they


have
 engineering
 managers
 that
 are,
 you


know,
 EM,
 they
 take
 care
 of
 teams.


that's
 their
 primary
 focus
 is
 making


sure
 that
 the
 team
 is
 healthy.
 uh
 they


also
 have
 two
 roles
 that
 is
 the
 tech


lead
 role
 and
 then
 the
 tech
 lead


management
 role


>> tech
 lead
 manager


>> which
 is
 unique
 to
 Google
 where
 uh
 so


it's
 basically
 you
 can
 think
 of
 them
 as


like
 uh
 a
 spectrum
 where
 you
 have
 EM
 on


one
 side
 where
 it's
 you
 know
 the
 person


like
 you
 know
 they
 have
 direct
 reports


they
 take
 care
 of
 the
 team
 they
 do
 all


the
 EM
 things
 and
 then
 on
 the
 other
 side


they
 you
 have
 an
 a
 IC
 individual


contributor
 who's
 a
 tech
 lead
 uh
 so
 tech


leads
 are
 in
 charge
 of
 uh
 you
 know


overall
 architecture
 tech
 aspects
 of


projects
 of
 products
 they'll
 make
 sure


that
 you
 know
 like
 tech
 decisions
 get


made
 they
 have
 the
 top
 say
 they
 get


appointed
 by
 EM
 but
 then
 there's
 this


slide
 in
 scale
 in
 between
 where
 you
 can


have
 tech
 leads
 who
 also
 have
 direct


reports
 and
 here
 we
 talk
 about
 tech
 lead


managers


which
 is
 this
 unique
 to
 Google


>> yeah
 but
 so
 my
 understanding
 of
 this


role
 because
 We
 introduced
 it
 at
 Uber


and
 it
 was
 influenced
 by
 Google.
 I
 think


we
 had
 a
 Google
 uh
 SVP
 come
 over
 and


then
 it
 was
 introduced.
 My
 understanding


of
 the
 the
 idea
 of
 this
 role
 originally


was
 well
 first
 let's
 talk
 about
 levels


and
 then
 well
 we
 we'll
 get
 to
 why
 this


role
 is
 kind
 of
 important.
 So
 the
 the


levels
 start
 from
 L3


which
 is
 L3
 is
 the
 entry
 level
 software


engineer.
 L4
 is
 mid-level
 software


engineer
 and
 Google
 has
 different
 names


for
 it,
 but
 that's
 kind
 of
 what
 it
 is.


L5
 is
 senior
 software
 engineer,
 L6
 is


staff.
 L7
 senior
 staff
 and
 L8
 principal.


Uh
 L9
 distinguished
 and
 L10
 partner.


>> So
 like
 or
 fellow,
 yes,


>> Google
 fellow.


>> Google
 calls
 it
 fellow.
 Uh
 I
 think


Microsoft
 calls
 it
 partner.
 And
 around


like
 at
 the
 senior
 software
 engineer
 at


the
 staff
 engineer
 level
 at
 L6
 another


path
 starts
 which
 is
 the
 manager
 path


which
 is


>> which
 is
 where
 injury
 manager
 u
 there's


sometimes
 an
 L5
 injury
 manager
 that's


more
 of
 an
 entry
 level
 but
 I
 think


they'll
 use
 it
 internally
 and
 then
 L
 L7


will
 be
 uh
 senior
 engine
 manager
 uh


which
 is
 this
 the
 same
 as
 the
 kind
 of


this
 the
 senior
 staff
 uh
 L8
 is
 director


which
 is
 now
 principal
 engineer
 so
 the


same
 level
 the
 same
 compensation
 and
 it


goes
 to
 L9
 senior
 director,
 L10
 VP
 and


then
 there's
 an
 L11
 on
 the
 manager
 track


uh
 for
 senior
 VP
 which
 does
 not
 exist
 on


on
 the
 IC
 track.
 So
 at
 Google,
 we
 have


this
 level
 from
 like
 I
 see
 L3
 to
 L10
 and


then
 manager
 from
 L6
 to
 L11.
 And
 at


every
 level,
 it
 starts
 to
 become
 harder


and
 harder
 to
 to
 go
 go
 up
 the
 path.
 And


around
 like
 L6,
 people
 need
 to
 decide


are
 they
 going
 to
 be
 on
 the
 IC
 ladder,


try
 to
 make
 their
 way
 to
 L7,
 L8,
 and
 so


on,
 or
 switch
 to
 manager
 ladder.
 But
 at


some
 point,
 you
 kind
 of
 like
 get
 stuck,


but
 maybe
 not
 necessarily
 an


uncomfortable
 way.
 So
 like
 when
 people


get
 to
 like
 L7
 or
 L8,
 you
 know,
 you're


not
 really
 going
 to
 go
 higher.
 And
 at


Google
 there
 there
 are
 are
 people
 with


really
 long
 tenurs
 like
 you
 know
 10


years
 20
 years
 even
 more
 and
 they're


very
 comfortable
 there.
 And
 so
 you
 have


these
 individual
 contributors
 who
 are


really
 good
 at
 their
 work.
 They're


they're
 the
 tech
 lead
 de
 facto
 and
 they


could
 manage
 their
 team
 that
 small
 team


like
 and
 typically
 these
 are
 small


projects
 but
 they
 don't
 really
 want
 to


be
 on
 the
 manager
 ladder
 cuz
 they
 want


to
 stay
 IC's
 and
 they
 don't
 really
 want


to
 be
 promoted.
 So
 this
 tech
 lead


manager
 role
 is
 kind
 of
 created
 for


those
 people.
 And
 this
 is
 really


important
 context
 because
 some
 other


companies
 took
 over
 this
 uh
 role.
 So
 the


duber
 for example
 and
 what
 they
 found
 is


people
 who
 went
 into
 this
 thought
 that


they
 would
 be
 promoted
 to
 the
 next


level.
 But
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 be


promoted
 when
 you're
 kind
 of
 expected
 to


both
 be
 an
 as
 an
 engineer
 you're
 not


doing
 as
 much
 work
 as
 before
 a
 little


bit
 less
 and
 as
 a
 manager
 you're


managing
 a
 team.
 So
 people
 can
 get


frustrated
 but
 for
 Google
 it
 worked
 as
 I


understand.
 So
 the
 technic
 managers
 are


typically
 they're
 they're
 not
 like


looking
 to
 go
 to
 that
 next
 level.
 It's


just
 more
 recognizing
 that
 hey,
 they're


doing
 both
 of
 these
 pieces
 of
 work.
 When


you're
 judging
 their
 performance,
 don't


compare
 an
 L8
 tech
 lead
 manager
 to
 an
 L8


IC
 who
 will
 be
 pushing
 out
 a
 lot
 more


code.


>> Yeah.
 My
 understanding
 also
 is
 that
 this


role
 is
 especially


like
 you
 kind
 of
 mentioned
 as
 well
 like


in
 like
 small
 teams
 uh
 usually
 like
 more


of
 like
 the
 research
 type
 things
 of
 like


hey
 let's
 try
 to
 build
 something
 out
 and


see
 if
 it
 works
 where
 the
 team
 also


wants
 to
 like
 move
 a
 bit
 more
 quickly


and
 it
 might
 not
 be
 around
 forever.
 So


it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 make
 sense
 to


both
 have
 an
 EM
 and
 a
 tech
 lead
 because


it's
 more
 kind
 of
 grassroots
 than
 that.


And
 so
 then
 you'll
 also
 have
 these


people
 who
 will
 sometimes
 manage
 the


whole
 team
 but
 like
 but
 but
 it's
 like


you
 know
 a
 couple
 people
 rather
 than
 you


know
 a
 full
 established
 team
 that
 has


what
 like
 way
 more
 cadence
 and
 way
 more


kind
 of
 em
 type
 work
 there.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 limit
 of


like
 four
 or
 five
 maximum
 reports.
 So,


and
 and
 usually
 it's
 stable
 teams.


Usually,
 it's
 not
 ones.
 And
 also,
 if
 if


you're
 on
 a
 team
 of
 like
 four
 or
 five


people,
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 not
 as
 many


promotions
 and
 and
 so
 on.
 And
 also,
 fun


fact
 about
 the
 levels.
 So,
 entry-
 level


software
 engineers
 start
 at
 L3.
 Those


are
 new
 grads.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 whole


L
 thing,
 as
 I
 understand
 it,
 it's
 to
 do


their
 there
 might
 be
 L1
 and
 L2
 within


Google.
 It's
 just
 not
 for
 engineering


because
 they're
 also
 salary
 levels
 uh
 as


well.
 uh
 PhDs
 uh
 if
 you
 have
 a
 PhD
 you


you
 start
 at
 L4
 minimum.
 So
 there's
 one


uh
 some
 other
 companies
 do
 the
 same


thing
 by
 the
 way
 who
 hire
 PhD
 students


but
 that
 was
 an
 interesting
 thing
 for


me.
 Uh,
 no.
 Uh,
 at
 Uber
 when
 I
 was


hiring
 interns,
 we
 hired
 a
 PhD
 and
 then


HR
 told
 me
 that
 that
 person
 needs
 to
 be


at
 the
 next
 level.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 okay,


sure.
 Like,
 fine.
 But
 I
 I
 guess
 it's


it's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 you
 see
 like,


okay,
 having
 a
 PhD
 pays
 off.
 But
 again,


we
 asked
 the
 same
 questions
 from
 the


PhDs
 as
 we
 did
 from
 from
 the
 new
 grat.


So,
 they
 still
 needed
 to
 algorithm
 the


coding
 interviews.
 So,
 there
 you
 go.


Yeah,
 I
 do
 think
 the
 like
 L1
 and
 L2


might
 be
 used
 in
 like
 very
 rare


occasions
 for
 like
 kind
 of
 interns


straight
 out
 of
 university
 or
 like
 they


find
 someone
 who
 uh
 didn't
 actually
 go


to
 university
 but
 like
 very
 very
 entry


level.
 Uh
 but
 like
 obviously
 the
 there's


expectations
 also
 on
 like
 all
 the
 low
 L


levels
 which
 is
 you
 know
 across
 the
 comp


uh
 our
 industry
 that
 if
 you're
 in
 a
 very


low
 L
 like
 you're
 supposed
 to
 kind
 of


progress
 to
 a
 higher
 level
 within
 like
 X


years.


>> Well
 yeah
 so
 so
 this
 used
 to
 be
 the
 case


but
 it's
 kind
 of
 changed.
 So
 like
 Google


has
 this
 had
 this
 thing
 well
 they
 still


have
 it
 called
 terminal
 level.
 terminal


level
 used
 to
 be
 L5
 senior
 and
 I'm
 not


sure
 if
 this
 was
 Google
 but
 there
 used


to
 be
 an
 expectation
 that
 as
 you
 said
 in


certain
 years
 you
 would
 get
 from
 L3
 to


L5
 later
 Uber
 copied
 this
 and
 at
 Uber
 we


had
 uh
 we
 had
 five
 years
 of
 expectation


to
 go
 from
 L3
 to
 L5
 and
 in
 the
 case
 of


Google
 and
 and
 then
 if
 it
 didn't
 happen


uh
 there
 will
 be
 questions
 asked
 and


some
 pressure
 and
 eventually
 they
 might


actually
 just
 fire
 the
 person
 saying
 hey


like
 why
 did
 they
 not
 to
 what
 we


expected
 and
 once
 you
 reach
 a
 terminal


level
 there's
 no
 pressure
 and
 what
 has


happened
 at
 Google
 is
 I
 they've
 changed


the
 terminal
 level
 to
 L4
 because
 over


time
 it's
 now
 to
 get
 promoted
 to
 L5
 you


need
 to
 like
 ship
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 pro
 a


project
 that
 shows
 that
 you're
 ready
 for


senior
 and
 the
 bigger
 the
 company
 is


sometimes
 there's
 not
 enough
 projects


like
 that
 especially
 in
 smaller
 offices


so
 it's
 now
 like
 you
 just
 need
 to
 get
 to


L4
 and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 there's
 a
 limit
 even


but
 Google
 has
 become
 a
 lot
 bigger
 than


before
 and
 this
 happens
 with
 every


company
 as
 as
 they
 grow.


>> But
 uh
 I
 think
 this
 leads
 into
 nicely


into
 the
 performance
 reviews
 and


promotions
 at
 Google.
 The
 performance


process
 it
 used
 to
 be
 called
 Perf
 and
 it


used
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 one
 of
 those


things
 that
 is
 like
 people
 famously


complain
 about.
 But
 they
 actually
 did
 a


big
 rehaul
 in
 I
 think
 2022
 where
 they


moved
 to
 a
 new
 system
 called
 Grad,
 which


stands
 for
 Google


review
 and
 development.


>> If
 you
 ever
 worked
 at
 a
 a
 big
 tech


company,
 it's
 a
 pretty
 similar


performance
 review
 process.
 People
 will


need
 to
 fill
 in,
 as
 I
 understand,
 their


their
 self-
 reviews.
 You
 get
 peer


reviews.
 Managers
 look
 at
 it.
 They
 give


you
 feedback.
 And
 there's
 a
 timeline
 for


this.
 So
 like
 this
 is
 Google
 runs
 once
 a


year.
 It
 starts
 in
 November
 and
 the


bonus
 numbers
 will
 be
 managers
 look


through
 it
 in
 in
 December.
 There's
 bonus


meetings
 behind
 the
 scenes.
 In
 January,


they
 get
 finalized
 and
 then
 they
 get


paid
 out
 in
 March.
 And
 so
 basically
 like


for
 the
 input
 that
 you
 put
 in
 November


and
 December,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 like
 a


final
 like
 output
 in
 February
 and
 you


will
 get
 the
 bonuses
 in
 March
 and
 either


you'll
 be
 happy
 or
 you'll
 be
 unhappy.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


differences
 like
 I
 think
 the
 Perf


process
 was
 like
 way
 more
 heavy
 on
 you


as
 an
 individual
 doing
 all
 the
 heavy


lifting
 uh
 where
 you
 had
 to
 spend


yourself
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 uh
 you
 know


putting
 together
 reports
 and
 like
 paper


trails
 essentially
 about
 all
 the
 things


that
 you
 do.
 And
 with
 grad
 supposedly


it's
 been
 pushed
 more
 to
 the
 managers
 I


believe
 which
 if
 you
 have
 a
 good
 manager


is
 probably
 an
 amazing
 thing
 because
 you


know
 you'll
 have
 a
 lot
 less
 work.
 Uh
 but


if
 you
 end
 up
 with
 a
 Yeah.
 like
 it
 it'll


depend
 on
 your
 manager
 it
 seems
 like.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 Google
 used
 to
 be
 known
 and


I
 think
 they
 still
 kind
 of
 are.
 They're


trying
 to
 be
 pretty
 fair
 in
 in
 how
 they


do
 performance
 reviews
 and
 and


promotions
 and
 and
 we'll
 see
 that
 with


with
 with
 promotions.
 I
 mean,
 the


manager
 still
 has
 as has
 a
 big
 say,
 but


they're
 trying
 to
 focus
 on
 uh
 outcomes,


outputs,
 etc.
 Like
 they're
 they're
 doing


more
 there
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 training
 for


managers
 going
 on
 antibbias
 training
 all


of
 these
 things
 and
 the
 the
 process
 is


really
 well
 documented
 and
 it
 is
 more


heavyweight
 than
 most
 big
 tech
 companies


and
 people
 take
 it
 seriously.
 Well,
 I


mean,
 after
 until
 a
 few
 years,
 and
 I'm


sure
 after
 a
 few
 like
 after
 like,
 you


know,
 5
 10
 years,
 people
 are
 just


probably
 like,
 "All
 right,
 here
 we
 go


again,
 especially
 if
 you're
 not
 wanting


to
 move
 up
 and
 and
 there
 are
 performance


scores
 or
 or
 feedback
 scores
 uh
 in
 terms


of
 like,
 you
 know,
 if
 if
 you're
 meeting


or
 if
 you're
 exceeding
 if
 if
 you're


above.
 But
 there
 is
 this
 interesting


thing
 called
 the
 Perf
 score
 resetting


when
 you
 change
 teams."
 So,
 this
 is


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 As
 I
 understand,
 this
 is
 kind


of
 a
 open
 secret
 that
 if
 you
 change


teams


during
 a
 perf
 season,
 so
 basically
 like


right
 after
 the
 perf
 season
 has
 on
 your


first
 perf
 season
 on
 your
 team,
 you
 will


always
 get
 meats
 meets
 expectations
 no


matter
 if
 you're
 how
 much
 you're


overdoing
 it.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 doing


terrible
 work,
 you
 might
 get
 below,
 but


you're
 you're
 typically
 not
 going
 to
 do


terrible
 work,
 but
 you
 will
 not
 get


exceeds
 no
 matter
 how
 hard
 you
 work.
 So


this
 is
 leading
 to
 like
 some
 pretty


strategic
 considerations
 on
 when
 to


change
 teams
 because
 getting
 an
 exceeds


rating
 means
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 higher


bonus
 but
 you
 know
 that
 when
 you're


changing
 teams
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 meets


you're
 going
 to
 get
 your
 target
 bonus
 no


matter
 what.


>> It
 was
 actually
 with
 Perf
 that
 uh
 that


they
 used
 to
 use.
 So
 yeah
 meets


expectations
 exceeds
 expectations
 and


then
 like
 very
 much
 exceeds
 expectations


basically.
 But
 actually
 with
 grad


they've
 updated
 the
 kind
 of
 terminology.


So
 now
 it
 mean
 they
 map
 to
 uh
 impact


instead.
 Uh
 so
 you
 have
 uh
 not
 enough


impact,
 moderate
 impact,
 significant


impact
 which
 are
 like
 the
 that's
 the


high
 end
 of
 like
 meets
 expectations,


exceeds
 expectations
 and
 then
 there's


also
 outstanding
 impact
 which
 like
 maybe


8%
 of
 people
 get
 is
 what
 I
 heard.
 So


like
 you're
 doing
 amazing
 essentially.


Uh
 there's
 also
 transformational
 impact


which
 is
 like
 the
 top
 top
 which
 is
 yeah


you're
 going
 to
 ship
 a
 really
 big
 deal


project
 in
 order
 to
 get
 transformational


impact.


>> Yeah.
 And
 usually
 behind
 the
 scenes


these
 will
 be
 tied
 to
 budgets
 meaning


that
 at
 the
 director
 level
 of
 like
 let's


say
 a
 group
 of
 like
 a
 100
 L5s
 only
 three


would
 have
 I'm
 just
 saying
 something.
 It


might
 be
 five
 but
 a
 certain
 number
 can


get
 transformational
 impact.
 And
 so
 on


the
 calibration
 meeting
 where
 all
 the


managers
 get
 together
 and
 they
 they
 all


you
 know
 submit
 their
 ratings
 there
 will


be
 a
 calibration
 where
 it
 needs
 to
 not


fit
 the
 curve
 but
 it
 needs
 to
 fit
 the


buckets.
 So
 there
 there
 often
 times


needs
 to
 be
 certain
 number
 on
 the
 lowest


buckets
 and
 maximum
 minimum
 certain


number
 in
 the
 lower
 the
 lowest
 buckets


of
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 ones
 who
 do do


not
 meet
 the
 the
 impact
 and
 only
 a


certain
 number
 in
 the
 in
 the
 top
 buckets


and
 it
 depends
 on
 how
 much
 these
 are


enforced.
 uh
 it
 depends
 on
 the


performances
 and
 depends
 on
 the


organization
 but
 there's
 always
 going
 to


be
 a
 distribution
 a
 force
 because
 uh


what
 most
 companies
 learn
 including


Google
 is
 if
 they
 don't
 force
 it
 a
 lot


of
 managers
 will
 just
 like
 shy
 away
 from


having
 the
 hard
 conversations
 or
 reward


either
 rewarding
 their
 their
 their
 their


best
 performers
 as
 they
 should
 be
 or


being
 a
 bit
 more
 critical
 with
 the


people
 who
 are
 not
 pulling
 their
 weight


as
 much
 and
 this
 is
 irrespective
 of
 this


happens
 at
 every
 large
 company
 after
 a


while
 and
 even
 when
 it
 doesn't
 for
 a
 few


years
 it
 can
 start
 happening
 after
 a
 few


years
 like
 we've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 companies


have
 like
 after
 relaxed
 uh
 performance


management
 in
 2021
 2022
 like
 the
 when


the
 job
 market
 was
 really
 hot
 they
 there


was
 a
 time
 where
 they
 gave
 everyone


exceeds
 I
 think
 Google
 did
 that
 once
 as


well
 to
 fight
 uh
 attrition
 and
 now
 it's


back
 to
 the
 usual
 of
 like
 there
 there
 is


this
 bucketing
 and
 we
 have
 a
 longer
 deep


dive
 on
 how
 calibrations
 work
 behind
 the


scenes
 from
 a
 manager's
 point
 of
 you


which
 is
 actually
 really
 interesting


slash
 eye
 opening
 but
 as
 an
 engineer
 not


much
 you
 can
 do
 beyond
 you
 know
 document


your
 impact
 have
 have
 a
 have
 a
 good


relationship
 with
 your
 manager
 and
 hope


that
 that
 manager
 stands
 up
 for
 the


people
 on
 their
 team.


>> Yeah
 and
 I
 guess
 I
 mean
 there
 is
 some


aspects
 of
 like
 you
 know
 the
 type
 of
 you


know
 work
 that
 you
 do
 and
 kind
 of
 extra


extracurricular
 activities
 if
 you
 will


that
 will
 feed
 into
 and
 like
 look
 good


on
 these
 performance
 reviews.
 Uh,
 and


Google
 does
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunities


to
 do
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 So,
 like


there's
 lots
 of
 mentorship
 programs
 and


not
 tech
 support
 but
 like
 uh
 helping
 out


with
 onboarding,
 helping
 out
 with
 coming


up
 with
 what
 they
 called
 code
 labs.
 Um


so
 because
 again
 because
 Google
 is
 so


unique
 like
 there
 has
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of


onboarding
 and
 kind
 of
 knowledge


spreading
 internally
 to
 on
 to
 teach


people
 how
 to
 work
 at
 Google


essentially.
 So
 that
 opens
 up
 for
 a
 lot


of
 opportunities
 for
 people
 to
 help
 out


with
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 If
 you
 like


working
 with
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff,
 like


kind
 of
 tech
 writing
 and
 like
 tech


learning,
 uh,
 Google
 has
 a
 lot
 of


opportunities
 for
 that.


>> Yeah,
 probably
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 than
 most


other
 companies.
 It
 sounds
 like
 they


actually
 appreciate
 it
 as
 well.
 So
 I


mean
 obviously
 you
 need
 to
 do
 like
 do
 do


good
 work
 like
 don't
 write
 sloppy
 code


and
 like
 it's
 full
 of
 bugs
 all
 the
 time


and
 then
 do
 all
 the
 extracurricular


things
 but
 when
 you
 want
 to
 show
 that


you're
 ready
 especially
 I
 guess
 this
 is


true
 for
 especially
 the
 the
 levels
 of


like
 we're
 talking
 L3
 L4
 L5
 above
 that
 I


mean
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 given
 that
 you
 do


all
 these
 things
 on
 the
 side
 in
 fact


they
 might
 hold
 it
 against
 you
 if
 you're


like
 an
 L6
 and
 you're
 not
 mentoring


anyone
 they'll
 be
 like
 or
 or
 you're
 not


helping
 other
 things.
 So
 it's
 not
 going


to
 help
 you
 from
 there
 because
 it's
 kind


of
 baseline
 from
 there
 on.


>> Yeah.
 There
 there's
 actually
 that


reminds
 me
 that
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


is
 built
 into
 the
 critique
 system
 and


their
 uh
 code
 review
 process
 is


something
 called
 readability.


Uh
 which
 is
 essentially
 again
 it's
 a


monor
 repo
 so
 like
 anyone
 can
 see
 and


review
 anyone's
 code.
 Uh
 but
 the
 code


review
 process
 is
 built
 up.
 So
 like


every
 every
 change
 list
 every
 CL
 uh


needs
 to
 get
 reviewed
 by
 three
 different


not
 it
 can
 be
 the
 same
 person
 but
 like


three
 different
 roles.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 uh


the
 code
 owner
 and
 like
 it
 has
 to
 be


another
 engineer
 like
 you
 can't
 review


your
 own
 code
 but
 then
 one
 person
 also


is
 just
 someone
 who
 needs
 to
 have


readability
 in
 the
 language
 you're


working
 in.
 And
 so
 readability
 there
 is


someone
 who
 knows
 about
 you
 know
 all
 the


best
 practices
 and
 conventions
 and


styles
 and
 all
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 And


so
 the
 they
 have
 this
 way
 of
 earning


readability
 in
 a
 language
 that
 you
 know


has
 to
 like
 there's
 a
 whole
 process
 for


it.


>> Yeah.
 We
 we
 we we
 talked
 about
 it
 with


with
 Arena
 on
 the
 podcast.
 She
 was
 ex


Google.
 So
 yeah,
 she
 also
 went
 you
 have


a
 process
 is
 pretty
 straightforward.
 You


need
 to
 like
 shadow
 I
 think
 be
 signed


off
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 and
 like
 do
 a
 certain


number
 of
 things
 and
 then
 eventually


you'll
 get
 readability.
 It's
 easier
 to


get
 these
 types
 of
 mentorship
 kind
 of


mentorship
 opportunities
 through


readability
 across
 the
 company
 without


necessarily
 like
 moving
 teams
 or


>> like
 knowing
 people
 like
 you
 have
 to


know
 the
 person
 people
 in
 that
 org
 in


order
 to
 like


>> that's
 a
 good
 trick
 to
 know
 about.
 Yeah,


you
 can
 just
 like
 focus
 on
 readability


like
 just
 look
 at
 open
 open
 CLS
 across


the


>> It's
 so
 so
 unique
 to
 Google,
 isn't
 it?


Like
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 any
 other
 company


that
 does
 this
 like
 at
 at
 Ruber
 and


other
 large
 companies
 like
 Yeah.
 like


you
 do
 mandate
 code
 reviews
 of
 like
 a


code
 owner
 but
 nothing
 to
 do
 with


readability.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 think
 it
 could
 be
 that


that's
 probably
 an
 artifact
 of
 the
 monor


repo
 again
 as
 well.
 The
 monorreo
 doesn't


necessarily
 like
 they
 still
 do
 a
 lot
 of


like
 micros
 service
 architecture
 for


like
 within
 the
 monorreo
 like
 it's
 not


necessarily
 like
 either
 it's
 monolithic


or
 it's
 microservices
 even
 if
 they
 do


have
 you
 know
 microservices
 and
 like
 the


tech
 in
 the
 teams
 or
 different
 products


will
 be
 you
 know
 separate
 maybe
 have


different
 architecture
 maybe
 like


software
 patterns


like
 compared
 across
 But
 like
 the
 again


like
 the
 tech
 is
 the
 same,
 the


readability
 is
 the
 same.
 So
 you
 could


almost
 think
 of
 it
 I
 think
 as
 like


several
 different
 companies
 that
 just


happen
 to
 have
 the
 exact
 same


engineering
 culture
 rather
 than,
 you


know,
 trying
 to
 compare
 this
 type
 of


stuff
 with
 how
 they
 do
 stuff
 at
 maybe


Meta
 or
 Amazon.
 It's
 more
 one
 company,


one
 tech
 stack.
 So
 it's
 like
 then
 you're


kind
 of
 more
 stuck
 in
 your
 silo
 so
 to


say
 versus
 here
 where
 you
 know
 someone


with
 reliability
 can
 help
 someone


working
 on
 a
 completely
 different
 thing.


>> It's
 it's
 an
 interesting
 approach.
 So
 uh


outside
 of
 performance
 reviews
 the
 other


one
 is
 promotions.
 That's
 and
 promotions


are
 different
 at
 Google
 because
 there
 is


this
 thing
 called
 a
 promotion
 committee.


So,
 my
 understanding
 is
 that
 Google
 has


been
 really
 big
 about
 trying
 to
 not
 be


biased
 in
 promotions,
 the
 way
 promotions


work
 at
 most
 companies
 is
 when
 you're
 up


for
 promotion,
 the
 group
 of
 your
 manager


and
 their
 your
 manager's
 peers
 all
 get


together
 and
 they're
 like,
 "All
 right,


is
 you
 know,
 Johnny
 ready
 for
 a


promotion?"
 And
 they
 all
 kind
 of
 talk


about
 why,
 you
 know,
 and
 your
 manager


says
 why
 they
 think
 they
 are.
 And
 then


their
 peers
 say
 like,
 "Yeah,
 we
 agree
 or


we
 don't
 or
 what
 about
 Jane?"
 And
 then


and
 so
 on.
 And
 so
 this
 group
 who's
 kind


of,
 you
 know,
 like
 kind
 of
 know
 your


work,
 they
 all
 like
 decide
 collectively


in
 the
 end
 or
 they
 get
 feedback
 why


you're
 ready,
 why
 you're
 not
 ready.
 And


the
 good
 thing
 about
 this
 is
 that
 they


all
 know
 the
 context
 of
 your
 work


roughly.
 The
 bad
 thing
 is
 it
 can
 be


pretty
 biased
 or
 or
 it
 might
 be
 pretty


ignorant.
 Like
 there
 might
 be
 some


managers
 who
 would
 veto
 you
 cuz
 like


well
 I
 didn't
 hear
 about
 this
 person
 or


I
 had
 this
 one
 bad
 incident
 one
 of
 my


teammates
 said
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 they
 got


into
 a
 fight
 with
 you
 etc.
 So
 there
 can


be
 some
 biases
 there
 and
 what
 Google
 has


done
 for
 a
 long
 time
 is
 they
 they
 said


all
 right
 let's
 just
 make
 this
 whole


process
 unbiased
 let's
 have
 a
 promotion


committee
 where
 no
 one
 knows
 you
 like


it's
 it's
 not
 your
 managers
 but
 it's


like
 this
 group
 of
 like
 senior
 or
 staff


plus
 engineers
 and
 other
 engineering


managers
 at
 a
 different
 part
 of
 the
 org


and
 they
 just
 get
 a
 written
 packet
 a


little
 bit
 like
 their
 hiring
 committee


that
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about
 they


decide
 your
 promotion
 based
 on
 that
 and


what
 this
 means
 they
 don't
 know
 anything


about
 you
 they
 don't
 know
 who
 you
 are
 I


mean
 they
 will
 understand
 the
 context


But
 they
 haven't
 to
 work
 with
 you.
 They


have
 no
 bias
 for
 or
 against
 you.
 And
 so


the
 decision
 should
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 like


objective,
 right?
 So
 they
 will
 decide
 on


your
 impact
 on
 they
 will
 look
 at
 the


framework
 that's
 that's
 there
 and
 and


the
 impact
 because
 again
 with
 the


manager
 uh
 group
 there's
 the
 other
 risk


that
 if
 you
 have
 a
 really
 strong
 manager


who's
 really
 influential,
 they're
 just


going
 to
 push
 everyone
 through.
 And
 then


you'll
 have
 some
 teams
 where
 people
 are


promoted
 who
 are
 clearly
 not
 ready
 or


not
 doing
 as
 great
 work
 but
 they
 have
 a


strong
 manager
 or
 or
 good
 man
 well
 good


manager
 from
 their
 perspective.
 There
 is


a
 very
 interesting
 kind
 of
 downside
 of


this
 promotion
 committee.
 Uh
 there's
 a


famous
 article
 called
 why
 I
 quit
 Google


to
 work
 for
 myself
 by
 Michael
 Lynch
 who


was
 an
 L4
 software
 engineer
 at
 Google


for
 four
 years.
 uh
 and
 he
 was
 stuck
 on


that
 level
 for
 four
 straight
 years


trying
 to
 get
 promoted
 for
 years
 one


after
 the
 other
 and
 he
 wrote
 this
 blog


post
 and
 he
 he
 failed
 every
 single
 time.


So
 he
 started
 to
 understand
 how
 the


system
 works
 and
 by
 the
 time
 he


understood
 it
 it
 was a
 bit
 too
 late.


first
 promotion
 uh
 he
 uh
 you
 know


submitted
 his
 he
 was
 doing
 a
 bunch
 of


maintenance
 work
 h
 and
 then
 the


promotion
 committee
 said
 that
 he
 had
 not


proved
 that
 he
 could
 handle
 technical


complexity
 and
 they
 didn't
 see
 the


impact
 again
 Google's
 big
 on
 impact
 so


they
 said
 to
 be
 promoted
 to
 L5
 senior
 he


needs
 to
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 Google
 then


he
 went
 back
 uh
 and
 then
 he
 was
 like


okay
 I
 need
 to
 have
 a
 project
 that
 can


have
 that
 impact
 so
 he
 now
 looked
 for
 a


project
 to
 get
 to
 get
 to
 promotion
 and


he
 got
 that
 project
 but
 then
 the
 project


got
 cancelled
 and
 then
 the
 the
 next
 year


I
 think
 he
 moved
 teams
 or
 he
 had
 to
 move


teams
 because
 his
 team
 got
 cancelled
 and


so
 so
 he
 had
 this
 like
 series
 of
 bad


lucks
 where
 and
 then
 and
 and
 then
 in
 in


I
 think
 year
 four
 he
 wrote
 in
 this


article
 I'm
 quoting
 him
 my
 quality
 bar


of
 for
 code
 drop
 from
 will
 we
 be
 able
 to


main
 this
 this
 thing
 for
 the
 next
 5


years
 to
 can
 this
 last
 until
 I'm


promoted
 I
 didn't
 file
 or
 fix
 any
 bugs


unless
 they
 risk
 my
 project
 launched.
 I


wriggled
 out
 of
 all
 responsibilities
 for


maintenance
 work.
 I
 stopped
 volunteer


for
 campus
 recruiting
 events.
 I
 went


from
 conducting
 one
 or
 two
 interviews


per
 week
 to
 zero
 because
 he
 just
 really


wanted
 to
 get
 that
 freaking
 promotion.


And
 and
 in
 the
 end,
 he
 quit
 Google.
 But


this
 whole
 story
 showed
 how
 it's
 super


easy
 to
 fall
 into
 Google
 into
 the


promotion
 trap,
 which
 is
 I
 need
 this


project
 to
 get
 me
 promoted
 and
 that's


it.
 And
 he
 actually
 explained
 and
 in
 the


end
 I
 think
 he
 said
 like
 what
 am
 I
 doing


here?
 Like
 why
 am
 I
 doing
 this?
 and
 he's


a
 smart
 a
 smart
 guy.
 He
 built
 a
 really


good
 business
 afterwards.
 But
 it
 felt
 to


me
 he
 just
 got
 unlucky
 of
 of
 of
 how
 his


teams
 changed.
 But
 also
 this
 is
 where
 we


should
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about


promotion-driven
 development
 that
 is


very
 real
 inside
 Google
 because
 all
 the


incentives
 are
 there
 for
 it.
 And
 and
 you


know
 there's
 there's
 this
 joke
 uh
 that


goes
 around
 uh
 of
 why
 Google
 has
 so
 many


chat
 products.
 I
 think
 you
 know
 they
 had


Google
 like
 they
 had
 Google
 wave


ghat
 uh
 and
 and
 they
 keep
 changing
 the


names
 and
 also
 the
 product
 also
 pay


Google's
 payments
 promotion
 it
 was


Google
 wallet
 then
 G
 pay
 then
 Google
 pay


then
 it's
 now
 Google
 wallet
 again
 but


you
 see
 sometimes
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 where


Google
 has
 a
 product
 like
 with
 their


chat
 product
 which
 is
 still
 not
 they


don't
 have
 a
 Slack
 competitor
 like
 they


have
 Google
 chat
 or
 maybe
 called
 Google


Workspace
 I'm
 never
 sure
 they
 have


certain
 products
 that
 are
 pretty
 niche


and
 they're
 they're
 they're
 launching


and
 they
 get
 a
 bunch
 of
 attention
 and


press
 from
 Google
 and
 they're
 often
 on


just
 one
 platform.
 For
 example,
 they
 had


a
 chat
 product
 just
 for
 Android.
 And
 if


you
 look
 closer,
 the
 incentives
 are
 that


Google
 really
 incentivizes
 you
 can
 get


promoted
 for
 having
 a
 successful
 launch


for
 showing
 traction.
 A
 lot
 of
 projects


at
 Google,
 you
 know,
 like
 people
 start
 a


new
 project,
 they
 get
 traction,
 they
 get


promoted,
 and
 there's
 this
 thing
 where


if
 you
 move
 teams,
 your
 performance


scores
 are
 reset.
 You
 will
 definitely


meet
 a
 meets.
 So
 if
 you
 hit
 a
 bit
 of
 an


obstacle,
 the
 launch
 goes
 up,
 but
 now
 it


kind
 of
 flatlines.
 I
 mean,
 you
 can
 stay


on
 that
 team
 and
 get
 a
 meat's
 review,
 or


you
 could
 move
 to
 a
 new
 team
 and
 get
 a


meets
 review
 anyway.
 So
 often
 teams
 will


move
 to
 a
 new
 team
 and
 either
 start
 a


new
 project
 or
 or
 join
 in.
 There's
 just


not
 much
 incentive
 to
 stick
 around
 on
 a


project
 that's
 not
 doing
 great
 for
 the


for
 even
 a
 year
 to
 kind
 of
 hang
 it
 out


and
 get
 it
 back
 to
 growth.
 There's
 just


more
 incentive
 to
 start
 a
 new
 one


because
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 promoted


for
 maintenance.
 That's
 that's
 that's


the
 gist
 of
 it.
 my
 my
 understanding
 and


and
 you
 know
 this
 goes
 back
 to
 Google


has
 this
 thing
 called
 killed
 by
 Google
 a


website
 that
 collects
 these
 like
 300ish


Google
 products
 that
 have
 been
 launched


but
 they
 have
 been
 killed


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 technically
 not
 run
 by


Google
 but
 uh


>> oh
 it's
 not
 it's
 not
 run
 by
 Google
 it's


just
 external
 external
 that
 one
 is
 not
 a


Google
 project
 but


>> that
 would
 be
 funny
 if
 someone
 internal


Google
 is
 like
 here's
 all
 the
 things


we're
 bad
 at


>> no
 but
 it's
 interesting
 because
 on
 one


end
 it's
 Google
 is
 very
 heavily


criticized
 because
 they
 are
 the
 biggest


tech
 company
 which
 seemingly
 wastefully


launched
 which
 is
 then
 kills
 projects


publicly.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 point,
 I
 I
 I


still
 wonder
 if
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 part
 of


how
 Google
 operates
 where
 they
 they
 do


want
 to
 see
 people
 launching
 stuff.
 And


again
 cuz
 cuz
 look
 at
 it
 like
 yes
 we
 can


make
 fun
 of
 how
 Google
 like
 you
 know


like
 discontinues
 Stadia
 a
 gaming


console
 or
 or
 or
 Google
 reader
 but
 show


me
 another
 tech
 company
 that
 that
 has
 as


capable
 of
 LLMs
 as
 Google
 has
 big
 tech


their
 own
 models
 or
 self-driving
 cars
 in


San
 Francisco
 and
 may
 maybe
 you
 cannot


do
 one
 thing
 without
 the
 other.
 I
 don't


know


>> the
 way
 I
 think
 of
 it
 is
 that
 Google
 has


had
 like
 a
 really
 good
 culture
 of
 just


creativity
 and
 innovation
 and
 just


allowing
 people
 to
 try
 things
 out
 and


see
 what
 happens.
 uh
 like
 famously
 the


20%
 time
 uh
 which
 it's
 not
 really
 around


the
 same
 way
 it
 used
 to
 be
 but
 there
 was


this
 yeah
 again
 kind
 of
 open
 secret
 that


any
 Googler
 could
 spend
 up
 to
 20%
 of


their
 time
 on
 some
 other
 project
 like


some
 idea
 they
 have
 a
 pet
 project
 a
 lot


of
 I
 think
 the
 the
 internal
 tools
 you


talked
 about
 earlier
 comes
 from
 that


kind
 of
 things
 where
 you
 just
 have
 the


ability
 to
 like
 oh
 I
 I
 It
 would
 be
 nice


to
 have
 something
 like
 this
 and
 you


build
 it
 for
 yourself
 and
 because
 it's


Google
 it's
 automatically
 available
 for


everyone
 and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 you


have
 built
 a
 tool
 that
 people
 use
 and


then
 you
 move
 team
 and
 now
 no
 one's


maintaining
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 part
 of


it
 is
 that
 that
 Google


allows
 you
 to
 be
 creative
 and
 innovative


and
 try
 new
 things
 and
 just
 like
 yeah


launch
 see
 what
 happens.
 But
 I
 think


another
 part
 of
 it
 as
 well
 is
 I
 think
 of


Google
 as
 being
 a
 very
 kind
 of


engineering
 first
 and
 engineering
 driven


organization.


If
 you
 compare
 that
 to
 say
 Apple
 which


is
 much
 more
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 design
 and


user
 experience
 driven
 and
 if
 you
 have


it
 versus
 say
 a
 meta
 or
 something
 like


that
 they're
 much
 more
 like
 product


driven.
 It's
 like
 if
 you're
 a
 product


person
 that's
 how
 you
 drive.
 I
 I
 think


at
 Google
 it
 seems
 to
 just
 be
 kind
 of


just
 engineering
 first
 and
 maybe
 one
 of


the


main
 ones
 that
 do
 that
 where
 it's
 it's


like
 it's
 the
 engineers
 or
 like
 you
 have


much
 more
 ability
 to
 decide
 what
 to
 work


on
 and
 like
 choose
 the
 path
 for
 yourself


if
 you're
 an
 engineer.
 like
 it's
 much


easier
 to
 get
 product
 traction
 and


essentially
 it's
 because
 if
 you're
 an


engineer
 you
 can
 also
 build
 it
 whereas


like
 if
 you're
 a
 a
 product
 person
 at


Google
 you'd
 have
 to
 you
 know
 convince


engineers
 and
 like
 do
 this
 whole
 thing


of
 like
 getting
 headc
 counts
 and
 stuff


whereas
 if
 you're
 an
 engineer
 like
 you


can
 just
 either
 do
 it
 yourself
 because


you
 have
 so
 much
 available
 to
 you
 again


through
 code
 search
 and
 the
 mon
 repo


like
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 start
 from


scratch
 every
 time.


>> And
 then
 one
 more
 interesting
 thing
 of


how
 Google
 works
 and
 I
 don't
 know if


this
 is
 like
 engineering
 driven
 but


maybe
 it's
 connected
 their
 their
 their


design
 docs
 culture
 is
 just
 really


really
 kind
 of
 famous
 to
 to
 the
 point
 of


apparently
 whenever
 you
 start
 a
 project


you
 you're
 expected
 to
 write
 a
 design


doc
 which
 is
 a
 Google
 doc
 which
 has
 like


certain
 sections
 and
 you
 know
 these
 are


kind
 of
 like
 loosely
 handled
 but
 it's


things
 like
 context
 and
 scope
 goals
 non-


goals
 an
 overview
 you
 might
 have
 your


architecture
 diagrams
 how
 it
 impacts


other
 systems,
 the
 structure
 of
 your


changes,
 maybe
 roll
 out
 plans,
 life


cycle,
 and
 many
 alternatives
 considered.


Some
 other
 companies
 have
 actually


started
 to
 to
 use
 similar
 approaches
 or


maybe
 just
 naturally
 spread.
 It's
 often


called
 RFC,
 request
 for
 comment.
 But
 at


Google,
 so
 every
 like
 project
 will
 be


rejected,
 even
 smaller
 ones
 if
 they


don't
 have
 a
 design
 dock.
 And
 it's


expected
 that
 you
 write
 this
 and
 you


send
 it
 around.
 You
 gather
 comments
 and


then
 you
 start
 coding
 which
 is
 really


interesting
 because
 you
 would
 think
 that


as
 an
 engineering
 driven
 culture
 one


things
 that
 us
 engineers
 love
 to
 do
 is


code
 and
 what
 we
 don't
 like
 to
 do
 is


write
 docs
 and
 yet
 Google
 settled
 on


again
 it
 is
 very
 engineering
 driven.
 Uh


why
 why
 do
 you
 think
 this
 might
 be?
 They


just
 realize
 that
 consensus
 is
 is


important
 because
 they're
 they're
 also


big
 right?
 They're
 the
 biggest
 probably


the
 biggest
 like
 engineer
 culture
 of


this
 quality.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 uh
 I
 mean
 it


might
 be
 something
 like
 you
 know
 they


introduced
 the
 20%
 time
 or
 like
 they


just
 had
 a
 maybe
 even
 before
 that
 was


formalized
 like
 there
 was
 a
 culture
 of


people
 just
 trying
 things
 out
 and
 maybe


realizing
 that
 like
 oh
 we're
 like


redoing
 the
 same
 things
 or
 building


something
 that
 like
 oh
 had
 you
 talked


with
 any
 other
 people
 you
 had
 realized


that
 like
 that
 was
 either
 like
 not


needed
 or
 not
 a
 good
 idea
 or
 like
 it
 has


use
 case
 of
 one
 like
 you're
 building


something
 for
 yourself.
 So
 that
 could
 be


a
 part
 of
 it.
 But
 I
 also
 think
 in
 terms


of
 just
 like
 the
 Google
 culture
 itself


and
 googliness,
 which
 we
 haven't
 touched


on,
 but
 googliness
 is
 basically
 this


idea
 of
 like
 people
 who
 fit
 at
 Google


should
 be
 googly.
 And
 it's
 it's
 kind
 of


a
 vibe
 thing.
 Um,
 and
 part
 of
 being


googly
 is
 that
 like
 it's
 it's
 less
 of


this
 whole
 like
 a
 bit
 less
 of
 the


rockstar
 mentality
 that
 you
 know
 you're


the
 rockstar
 engineer
 who
 just
 like
 goes


off
 and
 does
 his
 own
 thing.
 It's
 very


much
 more
 like
 collaborative
 teamwork,


team
 spirit,
 enable
 everyone
 to
 do
 great


things.
 And
 so
 it
 pro
 like
 I
 would


assume
 it
 comes
 from
 that
 as
 well
 like


part
 of
 being
 able
 to
 uh
 keep
 the


googliness
 is
 to
 just
 be
 very
 open
 and


there's
 actually
 like
 we've
 mentioned


the
 sur
 book
 there's
 also
 an
 SV
 book
 um


software
 engineering
 at
 Google
 the


office


>> yeah
 I
 have
 I
 have
 it
 here
 on
 my
 desk


software
 engineering
 at
 Google
 it's
 also


it's
 available
 for
 free
 online
 uh
 Google


made
 it
 available
 like
 it's
 officially


free
 it's
 not
 like
 one
 of
 these


pirated
 books.
 But
 yeah,
 it's
 it's


pretty
 big.


>> Yeah.
 and
 they
 they
 write
 about
 this


like
 that
 book
 in
 general
 like
 goes


through
 like
 it
 does
 talk
 about
 a
 fair


amount
 of
 the
 tools
 that
 we
 talked
 about


like
 the
 the
 Piper
 and
 the
 monor
 repo


and
 the
 critique
 and
 all
 that
 stuff
 but


it
 also
 has
 you
 know
 a
 big
 section
 of


like
 you
 know
 why
 are
 we
 doing
 this
 in


the
 first
 place
 and
 there
 are
 some


beliefs
 that
 you
 know
 software


engineering
 is
 a
 team
 effort
 and
 u
 like


these
 are
 the
 type
 of
 people
 that
 you


should
 have
 in
 a
 group
 in
 order
 to
 do


software
 engineering
 well


>> one
 thing
 that
 Google
 really
 gets
 And
 we


didn't
 talk
 about
 it
 so
 far,
 but
 they


really
 get
 how
 software
 teams
 work.


They've
 run
 both
 a
 lot
 of
 experiments.


You
 know,
 they
 famously
 run
 an


experiment
 where
 they
 removed
 all


managers
 and
 they
 figured
 out
 what's


going
 to
 happen.
 They
 didn't
 know
 like


they
 they
 thought
 that
 teams
 would
 maybe


work
 better
 without
 managers,
 just


engineers,
 and
 turns
 out
 they
 didn't.


And
 then
 they
 went
 back
 and
 they
 tried


to
 figure
 out
 what
 do
 good
 managers
 do,


what
 should
 they
 be
 technical
 and
 and


like
 they've
 done
 a
 lot
 of
 research
 and


they
 have
 published
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 these


things
 but
 you
 know
 at
 a
 lot
 of


companies
 I
 think
 as
 a
 developer
 you
 get


really
 frustrated
 for
 because
 it's
 it's


often
 times
 the
 business
 you
 know
 CEO
 or


someone
 pushing
 developers
 like
 do
 this


or
 that
 and
 they're
 asking
 why
 why
 is
 it


taking
 so
 slow?
 Why
 are
 you
 guys
 I
 don't


know
 like
 lazy
 or
 or
 do
 more
 with
 less


this
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 But
 things
 like


making
 a
 case
 that
 it
 would
 be
 nice
 to


have
 a
 platform
 team
 internally.
 It's


almost
 impossible
 at
 a
 lot
 of
 companies.


But
 at
 Google
 there's
 like
 platform


teams
 left
 and
 right
 which
 means
 you


know
 that
 they
 just
 build
 an
 internal


product
 or
 internal
 platform
 that
 the


other
 product
 teams
 use
 and
 most


companies
 like
 a
 nontechnical
 CEO
 would


not
 understand
 like
 why
 would
 I
 need
 to


do
 this
 like
 we
 just
 we
 have
 our


engineers
 like
 they
 can
 I
 don't
 know
 use


open
 source
 tools
 or
 whatever
 and
 even


when
 you
 use
 open
 source
 tools
 or
 for


your
 CI/CD
 system
 you
 still
 need
 someone


to
 maintain
 it
 at
 Google
 like
 it's


probably
 one
 of
 the
 best
 places
 where


yeah
 everyone
 gets
 it
 because
 they've


been
 doing
 this
 that the
 people
 up
 there


are
 software
 engineers.
 The
 founders
 are


are
 I
 mean
 they
 were
 PhD
 students
 but


they
 are
 software
 engineers
 even
 though


the
 founders
 are
 are
 are
 no
 longer
 uh


there
 but
 everyone
 all
 the
 way
 to
 the


top
 understands
 and
 breathes
 software


and
 I
 think
 they
 understand
 that
 the


software
 is
 a
 series
 of
 tradeoffs.
 It
 is


it's
 not
 just
 code.
 So
 even
 when
 it


comes
 to
 like
 AI,
 uh
 they're
 they're
 not


going
 to
 be
 like
 falling
 for
 what


everyone
 else
 is
 saying
 that
 I
 don't


know
 like
 AI
 will
 replace
 software


engineers.
 Like
 if
 if
 it
 would
 Google


would
 have
 zero
 of
 them,
 but
 Google


knows
 the
 value
 of
 software
 engineers.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 the
 limitation
 of
 them.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 exactly.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 also


like
 to
 tie
 it
 back
 to
 killed
 by
 Google


like
 like
 that's
 probably
 why
 like
 you


know
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 freedom
 to
 try


things
 out
 uh
 and
 then
 you
 build


products
 that
 might
 not
 make
 sense
 and


like
 if
 you
 had
 a
 much
 more
 kind
 of


product
 person
 influenced
 organization


or
 design
 person
 influenced
 organization


yeah
 they
 probably
 wouldn't
 have
 the


graveyard
 of
 killed
 by
 Google
 like
 Maybe


there
 would
 be
 like
 would
 probably
 be


way
 smaller
 and
 they
 would
 probably
 not


be
 as
 vocal
 about
 it
 like
 they
 wouldn't


make
 all
 of
 these
 sweeping
 announcements


at
 Google
 IO
 every
 year
 to
 only
 have


that
 product
 u
 you
 know
 go
 bust
 a
 couple


months
 or
 years
 later
 but


but
 that's
 like
 that's
 the
 other
 side
 of


the
 coin.


>> Yeah.
 One
 interesting
 thing
 that
 comes


up
 with
 Google
 outside
 and
 but
 I
 want
 to


touch
 on
 this.
 It's
 not
 really
 software


engineering
 but
 it
 kind
 of
 impacts
 us


OKRs


objective
 key
 results.
 Now
 if
 you're
 if


if
 you're
 a
 software
 engineer
 you


probably
 like
 and
 you
 worked
 at
 a


midsize
 or
 larger
 company
 this
 probably


came
 up
 like
 what
 are
 your
 OKRs?
 What


are
 your
 teams
 OKRs?
 The
 objectives
 the


key
 results
 and
 the
 goals
 and
 apparently


Google
 made
 this
 super
 popular
 this
 uh


this
 framework
 right?


>> Yeah
 exactly.
 So
 technically
 they
 didn't


invent
 it.
 uh
 they
 were
 actually


introduced
 in
 the
 70s
 at
 Intel
 which
 is


so
 long
 ago
 but
 there's
 this
 guy
 John


Door
 who
 uh
 was
 at
 Intel
 before
 he


joined
 Google
 kind
 of
 early
 and
 uh
 in
 99


he
 introduced
 this
 idea
 of
 OKRs
 and
 they


fit
 really
 well
 with
 Google
 at
 the
 time


and
 it
 became
 a
 big
 part
 of
 and


ingrained
 in
 the
 culture
 of
 of
 how
 they


operated.
 method.
 So
 yeah
 like


objectives
 and
 key
 results.
 Objectives


is
 like
 you
 know
 a
 kind
 of
 more
 highle


goal
 of
 like
 this
 is
 what
 we
 want
 to


build
 and
 then
 the
 key
 results
 are


specific
 measurable
 things
 that
 you
 can


measure
 in
 order
 to
 know
 that
 you're


moving
 towards
 the
 goal.
 some
 examples


of
 when
 they
 introduced
 OKRs
 in
 the


beginning
 back
 in
 99
 like
 their
 first


objective
 was
 build
 a
 great
 search


engine
 and
 then
 they
 had
 they
 came
 up


with
 their
 key
 results
 serve
 at least
 10


million
 queries
 every
 day
 achieve
 sub0.5


second
 response
 time
 for
 searches


improve
 accuracy
 of
 search
 results
 based


on
 user
 feedback
 and
 the
 last
 one
 hire


worldclass
 engineering
 team
 and
 you
 can


kind
 of
 tell
 that
 because
 they
 separated


out
 the
 goals
 from
 these
 very
 specific


measurable
 things.
 Everyone
 knows
 to
 be


on
 the
 same
 point
 and
 like
 okay
 so
 what


is
 what's
 the
 most
 important
 thing?
 What


what
 are
 we
 prioritizing?
 What
 do
 we


need
 in
 order
 to
 serve
 10
 million


queries?
 We
 need
 the
 data
 centers.
 We


need
 the
 network
 like
 we
 can't
 use


normal
 DNS.
 We
 need
 to
 invent
 our
 own


things
 etc
 etc.
 So,
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 going
 to


be
 honest
 like
 I'm
 always
 a
 little
 bit


like
 suspicious
 about
 OKRs
 and
 Google


like
 to
 me
 like
 because
 it
 it
 is
 uh
 the


book
 Measure
 What
 Matters
 was
 published


in
 2018
 and
 from
 there
 on
 it's
 really


blown
 up
 and
 I
 think
 everyone's
 like


using
 OKRs
 cuz
 it
 like
 there's
 this


narrative
 that
 OKRs
 make
 Google


successful.
 But
 I'm
 kind
 of
 thinking


like
 is
 this
 a
 little
 bit
 saying
 that
 I


I
 don't
 know
 like
 using
 Jira
 made


whatever
 company
 successful,
 SpaceX


successful.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 they've
 used


Jira,
 but
 like
 whatever
 ticketing
 system


they
 use,
 did
 that
 make
 them
 successful?


Cuz
 I'm
 like
 the
 smell
 that
 I
 have
 is
 I


have
 a
 sense
 Google
 would
 have
 been


successful
 whatever
 they
 use
 because
 you


know
 like
 it
 started
 with
 page
 rank.


They
 did
 something
 that
 everyone
 wanted.


And
 I
 I
 wonder
 if
 if
 OKRs
 is
 is


something
 that
 I
 mean
 it's
 it's
 probably


it
 works,
 but
 it
 it
 could
 have
 been


anything
 else
 cuz
 whenever
 I
 used
 OKRs


at least
 and
 you
 know
 we
 we
 we
 try
 to


use
 it
 like
 having
 a
 clear
 goal
 and
 and


a
 and
 a
 team
 that
 was
 focused
 on


building
 something
 was
 always
 way
 more


important
 than
 having
 whatever
 OKRs


because
 there's
 a
 usual
 criticism
 of


OKRs
 of
 like
 well
 if
 you
 make
 it
 a


target
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 it's
 kind
 of


silly
 because
 now
 you're
 only
 optimizing


for
 that.
 Because
 I
 saw
 at
 Microsoft
 for


example
 when
 I
 worked
 in
 like
 2000
 like


2020
 2010
 or
 2012
 the
 organizations
 were


all
 focused
 on
 their
 goals
 and
 they
 only


cared
 about
 their
 metrics
 and
 it
 was


terrible.
 We
 couldn't
 do
 stuff
 that


Google
 did
 for
 example
 like
 my
 team
 we


we
 couldn't
 agree
 to
 add
 our
 codecs
 into


the
 new
 Internet
 Explorer
 called
 Edge


while
 Google
 Chrome
 had
 it
 bundled
 cuz


the
 two
 orcs
 had
 different
 goals
 and


they
 cared
 about
 download
 size
 and
 not


not
 what
 we
 cared
 about.
 So
 anyway,
 it's


good
 to
 know
 that
 Google
 uses
 them,
 but


I
 I'm
 still
 kind
 of
 like
 I
 I
 I
 wonder
 if


that
 really
 makes
 all
 that
 much
 of
 a


difference
 for
 them.
 I'm
 sure
 it
 helps,


but
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 bit
 overblown.
 Yeah,


I
 mean
 it
 might
 have
 helped
 in
 the
 early


days
 just
 like
 I
 can
 imagine
 like
 maybe


convincing
 stakeholders
 or
 like
 early


investors
 and
 each
 other
 maybe
 of
 like


okay
 what
 are
 the
 things
 that
 we
 need


and
 like
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 OKRs
 is
 a


tool
 right
 like
 this
 is
 a
 way
 of
 framing


and
 communicating


priorities
 and
 what
 needs
 to
 happen
 with


each
 other.
 It's
 like
 if
 you
 use
 it
 in
 a


good
 way
 then
 you
 figure
 out
 all
 of
 like


oh
 actually
 we
 would
 need
 to
 do


something
 else
 or
 we
 need
 to
 do


something
 additionally.
 So
 I
 think
 if


you
 use
 it
 as
 a
 tool
 like
 you
 can
 use


tools
 in
 very
 bad
 ways
 and
 you
 can
 use


tools
 to
 great
 success.
 And
 I'm
 sure


Google
 has
 had
 plenty
 of
 OKRs
 that
 are


not
 even
 remotely
 close
 to
 uh
 what
 they


did
 you
 know
 in
 these
 early
 years.
 Um,


but
 like
 yeah,
 maybe
 it
 helped
 like


since
 they've
 been
 around
 since
 99
 like


probably
 they
 know
 like
 you
 know
 it's


helpful.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 I
 do
 think
 that


the
 tendency
 of
 like
 oh
 they
 use
 this
 so


therefore
 we
 should
 use
 it
 and
 then
 well


be
 Google
 is
 yeah
 that's
 not
 how
 it


works.
 Speaking
 of
 OKRs
 as
 as
 a
 tool
 for


communication,


u
 communication
 in
 general
 at
 Google
 is


is
 and
 at
 least
 has
 been
 very
 open
 and


very
 transparent.
 So
 historically,
 like


this
 has
 changed
 a
 little
 bit
 now.
 We'll


we'll
 get
 into
 this,
 but
 like
 culture
 is


shifting
 across
 the
 industry,
 including


Google
 in
 late
 years,
 but
 historically


it's
 been
 incredibly
 open
 and


transparent.


Um
 again
 like
 maybe
 it's
 like
 part
 of
 it


being
 the
 the
 monor
 repo
 and
 the
 fact


that
 everyone
 has
 access
 to
 everything


anyways
 but
 you
 know
 since
 pretty
 early


days
 uh
 Google
 used
 to
 have
 the
 or
 still


has
 them
 these
 weekly
 companywide
 town


hall
 all
 hands
 meeting
 check-in
 type


thing.
 It's
 called
 TGIF.
 So,
 thank


Google
 it's
 Friday
 or
 that
 was
 the
 uh


that
 was
 the
 original.
 Um
 and
 then
 like


with
 the
 engineering
 team
 being
 or
 the


company
 really
 because
 this
 is
 for
 the


company
 not
 just
 engineers
 uh
 it
 is


global
 so
 it's
 actually
 it's
 on
 Fridays


in
 one
 time
 zone
 but
 not
 in
 the
 other
 I


don't
 remember
 but
 so
 it's
 more
 like


TGIT
 now
 so
 think
 thank
 Google
 it's
 t


Thursday.


>> Yeah.
 But
 basically,
 uh,
 like
 it
 used
 to


be
 more
 like
 Sergey
 and
 Larry
 on
 stage


talking
 about
 stuff,
 doing
 open
 Q&As's.


You'd
 have
 different
 teams
 come
 in
 and


like
 present
 what
 they're
 working
 on
 or


what
 they've
 built.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 it's


it's
 one
 of
 those
 kind
 of
 cultural


cornerstones
 it
 seems
 where
 like
 I


remember
 when
 I
 was
 at
 um
 when
 I
 was


interning
 you
 know
 it
 it
 was
 on
 Fridays


and
 like
 there's
 there's
 the
 all
 hands


itself
 that's
 TGIT
 or
 TGIF
 but
 then
 you


know
 there
 would
 be
 an
 event
 at
 the


office
 where
 you
 know
 there
 would
 be


free
 food
 and
 drinks
 and
 sometimes
 some


like
 event
 like
 I
 remember
 there
 was
 a


Halloween
 one
 that
 had
 themed
 and
 like


they
 had
 decorated
 the
 um
 the
 cafeteria


and
 you'd
 just
 like
 have
 this
 weekly


chance
 to
 like
 go
 hang
 out
 with
 your


colleagues
 before
 going
 home
 from
 work


that
 like
 you'd
 learn
 all
 these
 things


from
 across
 a
 company.


>> Um
 and
 then


>> so
 it's
 a
 fun
 fun
 event,
 right?
 Like


it's
 worth
 showing
 up.


>> Exactly.
 It's
 a
 fun
 event,
 but
 it's
 tied


to
 one
 of
 like
 the
 kind
 of
 cornerstones


of
 communication
 across
 the
 company.
 And


then
 that
 you
 know
 it
 kind
 of
 trickles


down
 in
 a
 way
 because
 like
 Google


organization
 is
 very
 fragmented
 like


again
 because
 Google
 is
 basically
 many


different
 companies
 in
 one.
 So
 like


you'll
 have
 they're
 called
 product
 areas


like
 the
 big
 sort
 of
 completely
 separate


companies.
 So
 YouTube
 is
 one
 product


area,
 cloud
 is
 one
 product
 area,
 search


is
 one
 product
 area,
 advertisement
 is


one
 product
 area.
 Yeah,


>> that
 are
 like
 the
 big
 ones.
 There's


another
 one
 that
 I
 can't
 think
 of
 right


now,
 but
 you'll
 have
 those.
 And
 then


internally
 they,
 you
 know,
 you'll
 have,


you
 know,
 different
 departments
 and


different
 teams
 organized
 in
 some
 way,


but
 it's
 like
 it
 depends.
 There's
 reorgs


very
 very
 frequently.
 So
 you
 mentioned


like
 teams
 can
 just
 evaporate
 and
 cease


existing
 which
 is
 because
 of
 reorgs


because
 of
 you
 know
 projects
 being


sunset
 moving
 around.
 So
 like
 there's


probably
 never
 been
 like
 an
 org
 chart


that's
 lasted
 more
 than
 a
 quarter
 inside


of
 Google.
 Uh
 but
 then
 like
 within
 all


of
 these
 different
 organizational
 kind


of
 factions,
 you'll
 have,
 you
 know,
 kind


of
 all
 hands
 meetings
 and
 town
 hall


meetings.


>> Yeah.
 So
 you're
 saying
 it
 it
 kind
 of


like
 goes
 down,
 right?
 So
 like
 there's
 a


company
 one
 every
 week,
 but
 then
 you're


going
 to
 have
 your
 I
 don't
 know
 your


wider
 org
 and
 your
 your
 like
 you
 know


like
 the
 bigger
 org
 and
 then
 your
 your


teamly
 will
 you'll
 have
 a
 weekly
 team


for
 sure.
 So
 like
 every
 week
 you'll
 have


the
 TGIF
 or
 let's
 just
 call
 it
 as
 as
 in


your
 team
 meeting
 and
 then
 every
 other


week
 or
 every
 fourth
 week
 you
 would
 have


some
 of
 the
 other
 orgs
 and
 they
 can
 just


stack
 up.


>> Exactly.
 And
 then
 there's
 the
 like


functional
 orgs
 as
 well
 that
 comes
 into


it
 which
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 it's
 as
 much
 of


a
 thing
 with
 engineers
 but
 like
 you
 know


they
 have
 the
 SRB
 or
 and
 the
 design
 or


>> Okay.
 So
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 culture
 shock
 if
 you


come
 from
 like
 a
 10%
 startup.


>> Exactly.
 and
 like
 the
 Devril
 or
 and
 then


like
 each
 of
 those
 like
 discipline
 based


groups
 they'll
 have
 diff
 like
 there
 are


different
 ones
 in
 different
 PAs
 and
 like


so
 it's
 it's
 so
 much
 like
 it
 very
 very


much
 depends
 on
 where
 you
 are
 in
 what


org
 in
 what
 discipline


>> you're
 trying
 to
 say
 this
 is
 a
 downside


of
 transparency
 right
 because
 hear
 me


out
 so
 at
 Uber
 we
 had
 something
 similar


it
 was
 a
 little
 bit
 ridiculous
 and
 like


on
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 orwide
 all
 hands


which
 it
 didn't
 really
 concern
 And
 most


people
 people
 were
 just
 coding
 on
 their


lap
 cuz
 they
 were
 expected
 to
 show
 up
 at


on
 the
 meeting
 room.
 People
 will
 be


coding
 on
 their
 laptops
 like
 I
 I
 I
 don't


want
 to
 be
 here
 but
 I
 I
 need
 to
 show
 up


cuz
 the
 SVP
 is
 here
 and
 whatever.
 But


like
 what's
 what's
 the
 alternative?


Right?
 Cuz
 if
 you
 if
 you're
 saying
 we


are
 transparent
 and
 we
 want
 everyone
 to


know,
 you
 know,
 like
 we
 want
 everyone
 in


Google
 to
 know
 what
 the
 CEO
 thinks
 like


want
 every
 engineer
 to
 know
 what
 the
 CTO


thinks.
 You
 want
 to
 know
 what
 your


director
 thinks
 and


>> and
 just
 what
 like
 what's
 going
 on,
 what


people
 are
 working
 on.
 Well,
 then


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 meetings.
 Or
 you
 can
 be


what
 Apple
 does
 or
 like
 a
 more
 secretive


thing
 where
 like
 look,
 you're
 in
 your


team.
 You
 are
 not
 allowed
 to
 talk
 with


anyone
 unless
 you
 have
 special
 clearance


and
 you
 don't
 unless
 you're,
 you
 know,


so
 you
 have
 your
 team
 meeting
 every


week.
 That's
 it.
 Don't
 worry
 about
 it.


Oh,
 why
 are
 they
 like,
 you
 know,


drilling
 off
 the
 wall
 and
 like


disassembling
 next
 to
 you?
 That's
 not


your
 problem.
 Like,


but
 I
 feel
 those
 are
 the
 two
 extremes


and
 like
 there's
 different
 sort
 of


trade-offs.
 The
 sort
 of
 trade-off
 is
 you


will
 be
 in
 the
 dark
 and
 you
 will
 have
 no


clue
 why
 they're
 like
 wearing
 funny


outfits
 today
 and
 why
 they're
 like
 all


laughing
 and
 and
 then
 the
 other
 one
 that


you
 will
 know
 it's
 just
 like
 there's
 all


these
 oh
 you've
 not
 been
 in
 that


meeting.
 They
 actually
 told
 us
 there


like
 oh
 no
 sorry
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 get


some
 work
 done.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 just
 like
 it
 can
 probably


be
 pretty
 overwhelming.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 but
 I
 mean
 they
 are
 good
 also


again
 maybe
 because
 Google
 is
 so
 global


I
 think
 they
 are
 pretty
 good
 at
 you
 know


recording
 like
 I
 know
 I've
 heard


especially
 since
 the
 working
 from
 home


like
 pandemic
 situation
 like
 after
 that


they
 have
 even
 better
 kind
 of
 processes


in
 place
 for
 this
 kind
 of
 stuff.
 So
 like


cross
 crossatlantic
 meetings
 for


instance
 like
 there
 these
 days


apparently
 like
 they
 do
 some
 all
 hands


stuff
 twice.
 So
 they'll
 do
 one
 for
 a


time
 zone
 that
 makes
 sense
 for
 Europe,


one
 that
 makes
 sense
 for
 US
 because
 that


also
 used
 to
 be
 a
 thing
 where
 uh
 like


you
 can
 work
 on
 something
 that's
 like


primarily
 based
 in
 the
 US
 in
 Mountain


View,
 but
 you
 can
 be
 in
 in
 based


wherever
 you
 want,
 but
 you
 will
 have
 to


wake
 up
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 night
 to
 go


to
 meetings
 if
 you
 want
 to
 know
 what's


going
 on.


>> So
 let's
 talk
 about
 some
 things.
 There's


so
 many
 things,
 but
 some
 things
 that


make
 Google
 special.
 And
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 came
 to
 my
 mind
 that
 I


didn't
 really
 hear
 before
 a
 term
 called


reglers


and
 you
 know
 Google
 has
 this
 like
 fun


terms
 for
 like
 new
 Googlers
 newler


exgoogler
 googler.
 Reg
 Googleers
 is


apparently
 a
 program
 where
 Google
 talent


acquisition
 reaches
 out
 to
 former


Googlers
 saying
 hey
 you
 left
 Google
 a


few
 years
 ago
 want
 to
 rejoin
 and


apparently
 it's
 really
 successful.
 A


bunch
 of
 people
 come
 back.
 That's
 the


part
 that
 is
 not
 really
 common
 at
 a
 lot


of
 companies
 and
 it's
 a
 program.
 It's


working.
 People
 like
 it
 and
 yeah,
 people


are
 rejoining
 as
 well.


>> Oh,
 interesting.
 I
 didn't
 know
 there
 was


a
 pro
 program
 for
 it.
 I
 know
 plenty
 of


people
 who've
 left
 and
 rejoined.
 But


>> I
 heard
 that
 there's
 an
 outreach


program.
 Uber
 started
 to
 do
 something


similar,
 but
 I
 think
 it
 was
 just
 in
 one


of
 the
 offices,
 but
 I
 someone
 told
 me


that
 it
 seems
 to
 be
 happening.
 And
 I


don't
 know
 if
 the
 the
 program
 is


official,
 but
 yeah,
 the
 term
 regooler
 is


it's
 it's
 a
 fun
 term.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 love
 all
 the
 names
 for


the
 different
 Googlers.
 I
 have
 I
 have
 a


few.
 Yes.
 Like
 noolers.
 When
 you're
 a


new
 Googler,
 you
 get
 the
 nooler
 hats,


the
 famous
 ones,
 like
 you
 know,
 the


little
 caps
 with
 the
 little
 propeller
 on


it.


>> I
 actually
 I
 have
 this
 uh
 I
 got
 this


little
 android


>> friend
 when
 I
 was
 interning
 there.
 Uh,


>> wow.
 That's
 a
 collectible
 now
 today.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 It
 did
 have.
 So,
 this
 is


the
 little
 nuclear
 hat.
 It
 used
 to
 have


the
 propeller,
 but
 I
 broke
 it.


>> Wow.


>> And
 like
 it
 has
 the
 little
 Google


backpack.
 You
 can
 even
 open
 it.


>> Wow.


>> It's
 just
 so
 cool.
 But
 I
 think
 this
 I


mean
 this
 is
 part
 of
 like
 the
 googliness


of
 it
 all,
 you
 know?
 Like
 we've
 we've


talked
 a
 bit
 about
 the
 the
 playfulness


and
 how
 it's
 it's
 just
 part
 of
 the


culture.
 It's
 uh
 like
 the
 offices,


things
 like
 this.


>> But
 but
 what
 what
 what
 is
 googliness?
 Is


it
 like
 kind
 of
 fun,
 quirky,
 geeky?


What
 would
 you
 say
 it
 is?


>> They
 go
 through
 this
 in
 the
 SVE
 book


actually.
 Uh
 but
 like
 they
 have
 a
 couple


of
 kind
 of
 like
 values
 or


characteristics
 if
 you
 will
 uh
 of
 being


googly.
 And
 maybe
 the
 term
 like
 being


googly
 is
 like
 somewhat
 uh
 being
 like
 it


might
 have
 been
 bigger
 previously
 and


now
 it's
 they
 talk
 about
 it
 differently


but
 like
 being
 googly
 is
 a
 lot
 about


thriving
 in
 ambiguity
 because
 things


move
 so
 much
 all
 the
 time.
 There's
 lots


of
 reorgs
 and
 you
 know
 you
 try
 things


out.
 So
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 of


who
 you
 are.
 Uh
 there's
 a lot
 of
 values


feedback
 which
 ties
 into
 you
 know
 the


the
 Perf
 now
 grad
 uh
 feedback
 cycle.
 Um


challenges
 the
 status
 quo.
 I
 think
 we


touched
 on
 this
 as
 well
 like
 that's
 also


been
 like
 from
 day
 one
 with
 trying
 to


get
 people
 who
 look
 outside
 the
 box
 and


really
 accept
 that
 you
 know
 things
 could


be
 better.
 puts
 the
 users
 first


is


uh
 maybe
 somewhat
 of
 an
 ideal
 rather


than


>> Yeah,
 that
 sounds
 pretty
 ideal
 from
 from


using
 Google
 products.


Yeah,
 cares
 about
 the
 team.
 And
 yeah,


this
 is
 again
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 like
 it


seems
 from
 I
 mean
 I'm
 sure
 there's


exceptions
 but
 in
 general
 it
 seems
 like


the
 Google
 culture
 and
 googliness
 is


more
 about
 teamwork
 and
 succeeding


together.
 I
 think
 we
 mentioned
 bonuses.


One
 thing
 actually
 in
 the
 bonuses
 is


they
 have
 what's
 called
 peer
 bonuses
 and


also
 kudos
 which
 is
 like
 how
 googlers


can
 you
 know
 they
 have
 ways
 of
 sending


like
 an
 hour
 of
 massage
 to
 someone
 they


think
 did
 a
 great
 job.
 Um,
 and
 then


there's
 the
 peer
 bonuses
 that
 are
 uh


like
 more
 proper
 like
 monetary
 like
 not


like
 huge
 bonuses
 but
 like
 a
 bit
 uh
 and


like
 those
 really
 incentivize
 you
 know


doing
 things
 for
 other
 recognizing


things
 for
 others.


>> So
 there's
 like
 probably
 a
 few
 hundred


dollars
 or
 something
 like
 that


>> I
 think
 so.
 Yeah,
 I
 can
 look
 it
 up
 but


something
 like
 that.
 Yeah,
 but
 I
 I
 don't


I
 don't
 think
 have
 many
 companies
 have


this.
 Like,
 yeah,
 some
 do
 have
 the
 you


can
 send
 thanks
 and
 they're
 public
 and


everyone
 is
 like,
 "Oh,
 that's
 nice."
 But


usually
 there's
 not
 like
 a
 monetary


something
 attached
 to
 it.
 That
 sounds


pretty
 unique.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 the
 last
 Googly
 thing,
 at


least
 on
 the
 list,
 is
 does
 the
 right


thing,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 maybe
 um


ambiguous
 a
 bit.
 I
 mean
 Google
 used
 to


have
 the
 motto
 don't
 be
 evil
 which
 they


kind
 of
 faced
 out
 and
 I
 think
 it
 was


like
 2018
 but
 that
 was
 one
 of
 the


tenants
 from
 very
 early
 on
 to
 just


I
 think
 it
 goes
 as
 again
 with
 the
 status


quo
 like
 there's
 plenty
 of
 examples
 of


big
 corporations


you
 know
 starting
 out
 with
 good


intention
 and
 then
 maybe
 getting
 lost


along
 the
 way.
 Well,
 it
 it
 it
 could
 be


lost
 along
 the
 way,
 but
 also
 it
 could
 be


like
 when
 you're
 big
 enough
 size,
 like


it
 goes
 back
 to
 like
 when
 you
 start
 to


be
 uh
 doing
 government
 contracts
 and


then
 the
 government
 does
 something
 that


is
 just
 either
 ethically
 wrong
 or
 or
 a


group
 of
 people
 disagree
 with
 it
 or
 a


large
 group
 of
 people
 disagree
 with
 it.


Do
 you
 stop
 working
 with
 the
 government?


And
 if
 so,
 you're
 now
 giving
 up
 that


space
 for
 your
 competitors.
 And
 then
 you


know
 it
 now
 goes
 into
 the
 territory
 of


like
 what
 about
 other
 governments
 when


you're
 a
 global
 company.
 If
 your


software
 is
 used
 in
 every
 single


country,
 what
 if
 one
 country
 attacks
 the


other?
 Are
 you
 also
 the
 evil
 country
 or


or
 if
 if
 two
 countries
 attack
 each


other,
 you
 know,
 like
 both
 sides
 will


think.
 So
 all
 I'm
 saying
 is
 there
 there


could
 be
 a
 point
 where
 by
 being
 involved


you
 you
 can
 be
 part
 of
 it.
 So
 that
 that


might
 also
 be
 one
 part
 because
 that


that's
 also
 one
 thing
 that
 Google
 is


being
 attacked
 on
 for
 for
 example
 uh
 not


just
 Google
 but
 all
 all
 companies
 of
 you


know
 like
 providing
 software
 for
 I
 I


think
 I
 think
 maybe
 it's
 the
 the
 US


defense
 uh
 ministry
 because
 they're
 now


using
 it
 for
 something
 and
 all
 the
 big


tech
 companies
 now
 provide
 software


there
 and
 you
 know
 the
 alternative
 is


like
 pull
 out
 and
 give
 up
 on
 the
 market.


Yeah.
 And
 also
 I
 I
 guess
 this
 goes
 back


to
 like
 do
 the
 right
 thing.
 It's
 it's
 a


it's
 in
 this
 book.
 I
 I
 just
 read
 it.
 But


the
 right
 thing
 for
 who?
 Right?
 Cuz
 u
 as


a
 software
 engineer,
 what
 what
 is
 doing


the
 right
 thing
 for
 a
 service
 mean?
 Does


it
 mean
 that
 we
 will
 have
 a
 great
 on


call
 experience
 and
 uh
 we
 will
 invest
 a


lot
 of
 time
 maintaining
 the
 system
 or
 do


we
 do
 the
 right
 thing
 by
 shipping


features
 quickly
 so
 our
 the
 business


gets
 stays
 ahead
 or
 do
 we
 do
 the
 right


thing
 that
 when
 customers
 complain
 the


tickets
 come
 to
 developers
 immediately


and
 we
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the


night?
 like
 the
 right
 thing
 for
 who,


right?


>> So,
 there
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 ambuggy


there.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 but
 to
 be
 fair,
 like
 it's
 it's
 in


the
 book
 here
 actually.
 Yeah.
 It's
 great


that
 they
 printed
 it
 in
 the
 book.
 Do
 the


right
 thing
 says
 has
 a
 strong
 sense
 of


ethics
 about
 everything
 they
 do.
 Willing


to
 make
 difficult
 or
 inconventional


inconvenient
 decisions
 to
 protect
 the


integrity
 of
 the
 team
 and
 the
 product.


It's
 interesting.
 So
 customer
 is
 not


mentioned
 here,
 nor
 is
 user.
 And
 and


there's
 no
 customer
 anywhere.
 They
 do


say
 user,
 but
 there's
 no
 customer.


That's
 one
 thing
 I
 noticed
 with
 Google.


They
 never
 talk
 about
 customers.
 And


about
 70
 they
 always
 only
 say
 users.
 And


that's
 I
 think
 that's
 an
 interesting


thing
 uh
 cuz
 about
 70%
 of
 Google's


revenue
 comes
 from
 ads.
 So
 they
 need


users
 but
 not
 necessarily
 customers.
 And


this
 is
 one
 frustration
 by
 the
 way
 that


like
 I
 personally
 have
 with
 Google.
 You


know,
 you
 cannot
 you
 can
 never
 get


customer
 support.
 You
 you're
 paying
 for


the
 product
 but
 you
 cannot
 get
 through


to
 a
 a
 person.
 And
 this
 is
 you
 know
 it's


very
 different
 to
 Amazon
 where
 Amazon


does
 give
 you
 first
 class
 customer


support
 but
 they
 do
 burn
 engineers
 in
 in


into
 pushing
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 uh
 you


know
 that
 the
 systems
 are
 work
 they're


they're
 repaired.
 Interesting


trade-offs.


>> It
 makes
 sense
 in
 a
 way
 where
 like


obviously
 Google
 Cloud
 Platform


I
 mean
 I
 guess
 the
 the
 earliest
 like


kind
 of
 precursor
 to
 that
 I
 think
 is


when
 they
 opened
 up
 App
 Engine
 back
 in


2008.
 engine.
 Yep.
 I
 was
 an
 early
 user


of
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 because
 like
 again
 like
 the
 the


Google
 infrastructure
 was
 primarily


built
 for
 Google.
 It
 was
 never
 meant
 to


be
 built
 for
 customers
 and
 then
 you
 know


they
 had
 these
 you
 know
 they


externalized
 parts
 of
 this
 and
 that
 you


know
 grew
 to
 become
 the
 Google
 Cloud


Platform.
 They
 obviously
 made
 design


decisions
 and
 choices
 pro
 I'm
 I'm


assuming
 while
 externalizing
 some
 of


these
 like
 building
 basil
 um
 coming
 from


blaze
 kubernetes
 from
 borg
 you
 know


they've
 must
 have
 built
 in
 you
 know


parts
 of
 it
 that's
 like
 okay
 so
 how
 do


we
 make
 this
 work
 for
 other
 companies


other
 use
 cases
 but
 yeah
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


different
 it's
 an
 interesting
 difference


between
 GCP
 and
 and
 other
 cloud


providers
 is
 like
 where
 where
 it
 started


from
 so
 to
 say.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 That
 that
 that
 that
 is


really
 new
 to
 to
 Google.
 So
 I
 think


Google
 cloud
 in
 in
 general
 it
 did
 start


from
 app
 engine
 which
 so
 unlike
 a
 lot
 of


Google
 services
 it
 was
 not
 start
 from


internally
 and
 externalized
 but
 it
 was


built
 as
 a
 an
 app
 I
 was
 an
 early
 user
 of


app
 engine.
 App
 Engine
 was
 so
 darn
 cheap


everyone
 used
 it
 because
 of
 it.
 It
 was
 a


lot
 cheaper
 than
 using
 AWS
 and
 running


your
 own
 ET
 EC2
 instance
 and
 and
 you


didn't
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 scaling
 it.


autoscaled.
 And
 then
 what
 happened
 in


2010
 or
 2009
 cuz
 I
 was
 a
 user
 of
 it.
 I
 I


built
 a
 side
 project
 on
 it
 that
 had
 a


few
 hundred
 thousand
 users
 and
 I
 was


paying
 pennies
 for
 it
 and
 there
 was
 like


some
 big
 reorg
 inside
 Google
 and
 they


shut
 down
 a
 lot
 of
 projects
 I
 assuming


that
 they
 were
 not
 profitable
 and


overnight
 Google
 app
 engine
 changed


their
 billing
 to
 be
 like
 5x
 as
 expensive


and
 suddenly
 before
 they
 they
 said
 like


all
 right
 like
 you
 can
 deploy
 you
 know


your
 code
 and
 we
 will
 autoscale
 you


don't
 need
 to
 worry
 about
 it
 and
 now


they
 had
 to
 worry
 us
 about
 like
 index


rights
 and
 They
 exposed
 us
 to
 our


infrastructure
 and
 everything
 became
 a


lot
 more
 expensive.
 People
 were
 voted


and
 they
 gave
 us
 30
 days
 of
 notice
 which


was
 like
 really
 really
 short.
 So
 it
 felt


to
 me
 that
 it
 was
 a
 do
 or
 die
 moment
 in


the
 sense
 that
 either
 that
 that
 or


proves
 that
 it
 can
 be
 profitable
 or
 or


generate
 revenue
 or
 they're
 shut
 down.


But
 it
 was
 the
 first
 time
 with
 Google


where
 I
 felt
 really
 burnt.
 I
 I
 I
 used
 to


think
 of
 Google
 as
 like
 this
 amazing


place
 that
 you
 know
 will
 not
 trick
 their


users.
 And
 I
 felt
 just
 tricked
 and
 I
 I


was
 really
 like
 miffed.
 Now,
 I
 wrote
 a


really
 nasty
 letter
 on
 the
 customer


support
 forum
 because
 of
 course
 it's
 a


the
 only
 support
 forum
 was
 a
 Google


Google
 groups
 or
 Google
 forum
 or
 or


whatever
 that
 was.
 That's
 where
 the


official
 engineering
 team
 work
 with
 us.


You
 can
 see
 that
 Google
 is
 terrible
 at


dealing
 with
 paying
 customers.
 It's


almost
 like
 they
 don't
 they
 don't
 care.


It's
 almost
 like
 they
 despised
 them
 a


little
 bit.
 Not
 always,
 but
 but
 in
 a


weird
 way.
 Like
 most
 companies
 will
 be,


you
 know,
 like
 put
 them
 at
 the
 the
 top


and
 Google
 just
 treats
 them
 the
 same
 as


free
 users.
 At
 least
 that
 was
 my
 my


sense.
 But
 yes,
 that
 that's
 how
 Google


Cloud
 started.
 And
 there's
 this
 really


really
 weird
 thing
 or
 unique
 thing
 with


Google
 where
 everything
 that
 Google


builds,
 every
 major
 product
 or
 that
 they


invest
 in
 massively
 is
 number
 one.


YouTube,
 Gmail,
 Google
 Maps
 you
 could


argue,
 but
 it's
 probably
 the
 most
 used


map
 solution.
 Android,
 Chrome,
 and
 then


you
 have
 Google
 Cloud,
 which
 is
 the


number
 three
 cloud
 service
 provider
 uh


across
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


measurements.
 They're
 way
 behind
 uh
 AWS.


They're
 behind
 Azure
 and
 they're
 very


they're
 not
 really
 seeming
 to
 catch
 up.


They
 seem
 to
 be
 stuck
 in
 this
 perpetual


third
 place.
 The
 strange
 thing
 about
 it


to
 me
 is
 is
 I
 I
 would
 assume
 if
 it's


Google,
 it's
 very
 easy
 how
 to
 make
 it


you
 know
 number
 one
 is
 like
 I
 start


Google
 start
 using
 their
 own
 cloud


service
 and
 I
 mean
 that
 gives
 the


confidence
 of
 everyone
 well
 if
 Google
 is


built
 on
 GCP
 you
 know
 like
 this
 is
 uh


what
 what
 like
 you
 can
 you
 can
 trust
 it


and
 AWS
 did
 this
 over
 a
 long
 long
 set
 of


time.
 They
 have
 moved
 over
 almost


everything.
 Amazon.com
 runs
 on
 AWS
 as
 I


understand.
 It
 took
 a
 long
 time,
 but
 now


it's
 all
 runs
 on
 it.
 When
 I
 was
 at


Microsoft,
 they
 they
 just
 bought
 Skype


and
 I
 was
 in
 the
 Skype
 or
 they
 forced
 us


to
 move
 over
 to
 Azure
 and
 we
 hated
 it.


It
 was
 not
 ready.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


things,
 but
 we
 had
 to
 move
 move
 it
 and
 a


good
 part
 of
 Microsoft
 runs
 on
 Azure.


Not
 all
 of
 it.
 Like
 Bing
 I
 understand


has
 their
 own
 infra
 but
 Google
 doesn't


really
 run
 on
 GCP
 or
 maybe
 some
 small


parts
 of
 it
 do.


>> Yeah.
 So
 they've
 had
 a
 few
 from
 from
 my


understanding
 my
 research
 they
 they
 have


a
 few
 like
 they've
 made
 attempts
 to
 move


and
 migrate
 some
 stuff
 over
 to
 GCP
 and


there
 are
 things
 that
 run
 on
 GCP.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 but
 some
 things
 do.
 the


way
 that
 they
 they've
 externalized
 their


product
 as
 they
 say
 it's
 it's
 very
 much


like


you
 know
 Kubernetes
 is
 not
 Borg
 uh
 by


choice
 and
 Borg
 is
 set
 up
 for
 planet


scale
 is
 you
 know
 what
 they
 refer
 to
 it


as


>> and
 that
 is
 not
 most
 use
 cases
 it
 is


very
 specific
 and
 they've
 made
 a
 lot
 of


engineering
 decisions
 that
 you
 know
 like


with
 again
 like
 everything
 from


networking
 to
 databases
 to
 like


literally
 everything
 is
 custom.
 So
 like


does
 it
 actually
 make
 sense
 to
 just


externalize
 that?
 Not
 really.
 But
 that


also
 means


that
 like
 well
 if
 if
 that's
 what
 they


have
 like
 if
 they
 want
 to
 win
 in
 cloud


that
 would
 probably
 be
 a
 thing
 that
 they


should
 do
 in
 order
 to


you
 know
 really
 boost
 the
 platform
 to
 be


as
 good
 as
 possible


but
 then
 again
 it's
 like
 do
 they
 have
 to


win
 at
 cloud
 because
 maybe
 if
 they
 win


at
 cloud
 they
 are
 not
 going
 to
 win
 at


all
 the
 other
 things.
 Yeah,
 I
 I I
 the


question
 is
 if
 if
 they
 want
 to
 win,
 but


I
 I
 got
 this
 because
 I
 have
 been
 asking


a
 few
 Googlers
 or
 GCP
 people
 about
 this


like
 what
 because
 I
 still
 remember


inside
 Microsoft
 it
 people
 were
 not


happy
 music
 and
 it
 was
 just
 dumb.
 By
 the


way,
 the
 guy
 who
 did
 it
 was
 Satia
 Sachia


Nadella.
 He
 he
 was
 pushing
 people
 to
 do


it.
 He
 was
 not
 the
 CEO
 back
 then
 but
 he


is
 now.
 But
 you
 know
 Microsoft
 clearly


could
 be
 number
 two
 with
 Azure
 because


internally
 they're
 pushing
 it
 just
 as


much
 as
 externally.
 So
 they're
 they're


going
 to
 keep
 improving
 it.
 But
 someone


at
 at
 Google
 an
 engineer
 told
 us
 how


like
 I
 I
 have
 heard
 a
 lot
 of
 Googlers


say
 that
 their
 internal
 infra
 superior


and
 it's
 engineer
 told
 us
 that
 superior


is
 an
 interesting
 term
 here.
 It's
 not


like
 feature
 to
 feature
 Google
 internal


is
 better
 than
 GCP
 but
 the
 level
 of


vertical
 integration
 across
 the
 the


entire
 development
 process
 from
 like
 you


know
 like
 like
 doing
 the
 planner
 doing


your
 docs
 code
 reviews
 all
 that
 is


unmatched
 because
 every
 part
 of
 the


workflow
 has
 been
 thought
 of
 and
 it's


got
 these
 like
 nice
 hooks
 and
 as
 a


developer
 it
 just
 works
 so
 much
 better.


So
 there's
 all
 these
 like
 decades
 worth


of
 integration
 of
 the
 custom
 stack
 that


it
 just
 works
 between
 all
 the
 tools
 that


there
 is
 tight
 coupling
 that
 would
 be


not
 possible
 and
 in
 the
 end
 devs
 will


just
 do
 whatever
 makes
 it
 easier
 work


for
 them
 like
 Google
 as
 a
 company
 will


probably
 be
 like
 well
 we
 want
 to
 be


productive
 right
 that's
 why
 you
 have


your
 internal
 platform
 teams
 and
 as
 you


said
 that's
 probably
 Google
 being


productive
 and
 building
 their
 product


and
 generating
 ad
 revenue
 80%
 of
 the


time
 and
 other
 20%
 will
 be
 hardware


sales
 and
 like
 some
 service
 sales
 and


all
 that,
 it's
 probably
 more
 more


important
 that
 they
 they
 grow
 their


business
 as
 opposed
 to
 just
 growing
 the


cloud.
 The
 cloud
 or
 can
 figure
 it
 out


and
 being
 and
 maybe
 being
 number
 three


in
 one
 of the
 biggest
 business
 in
 the


world.
 Um,
 in
 the
 case
 of
 cloud
 is


acceptable
 just
 the
 same
 way
 as
 Google


is
 number
 two
 on
 on
 mobile
 in
 a
 lot
 of


regions
 with
 Android.
 They're
 not
 number


one.
 They're
 number
 one
 in
 some
 part
 of


the
 world.
 They're
 number
 two
 in
 some


other
 parts
 of
 the
 world.
 So,
 you're


right.
 May
 maybe
 Google
 is
 way
 bigger


than
 this
 and
 and
 maybe
 this
 is
 a
 this


is
 not
 a
 they
 don't
 need
 to
 win
 at


everything
 right
 like
 only
 in
 the
 in
 the


important
 search
 with
 self-driving
 there


seem
 seeming
 to
 be
 investing
 heavily


LLMs
 maybe
 those
 are
 the
 things
 that


they
 really
 want
 to
 win
 in


>> I
 mean
 speaking
 of
 of
 tradeoffs


in
 general
 I
 think
 like
 if
 you
 really


think
 about
 it
 and
 if
 if
 Google
 were
 to


move
 everything
 to
 GCP
 like
 if
 that
 also


I
 guess
 like
 because
 they
 built
 out,
 you


know,
 their
 build
 system,
 their
 monor


repo,
 all
 their
 developer
 tooling
 on
 top


of
 the
 same
 infrastructure.
 It's


different.


>> It
 just
 might
 not
 not
 work
 as
 much
 as


especially
 when
 you
 have
 like
 all
 the


permission
 system
 that
 are
 like
 built


baked
 in
 into
 internally.
 Who
 knows?
 I
 I


think
 it's
 trade-offs,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> It's
 probably
 a
 good
 reminder
 that
 like


you
 don't
 need
 to
 like
 there's
 no
 no
 one


solution.
 And
 also
 history
 of
 a
 company


is
 I
 think
 pretty
 relevant
 to
 understand


why
 they
 are
 where
 where
 they
 are
 right


now.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 That's
 one
 of
 the
 the
 big


takeaways
 for
 me
 doing
 this
 research.


Maybe
 I
 mentioned
 it
 earlier
 as
 well.


Like
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 why
 they


can
 be
 so
 open
 about
 the
 stuff
 they're


open
 about
 is
 that
 is
 like
 it
 just
 like


it
 happened
 this
 way
 because
 it
 was
 so


early
 and
 you
 know
 they
 made
 some
 fairly


early
 acquisitions
 and
 strategic
 pivots


into
 you
 know
 like
 we're
 not
 just


building
 one
 thing
 we're
 building


completely
 different
 things
 like
 the
 or


is
 set
 up
 based
 on
 that
 the
 workflow


developer
 tooling
 everything
 is
 just
 so


interconnected
 with
 Google,
 which
 is
 why


I
 think
 it's
 so
 it's
 been
 so
 interesting


to
 uh
 learn
 about
 it


>> and
 and
 I
 I
 want
 I'm
 thinking
 that
 the


companies
 that
 are
 now
 growing
 as
 fast


as
 Google
 did
 in
 the
 past.
 Open
 AI
 is
 a


good
 example
 of
 of
 this
 of
 some
 of
 the


AI
 other
 AI
 startups
 or
 maybe
 you
 know


Nvidia's
 growth
 is
 is
 speeding
 up


although
 they're
 more
 in
 the
 hardware


business
 or
 for
 social
 media
 Snap
 uh
 or


even
 Meta.
 Well,
 they
 they
 were
 earlier


a
 little
 bit,
 but
 let's
 say
 for
 for


OpenAI,
 they
 are
 now,
 you
 know,
 they're


building
 other
 things
 custom.
 We're
 not


talking
 about
 they
 they're
 using
 cloud


like
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 I
 I
 mean,


OpenAI
 is
 seems
 like
 they're
 investing


in
 their
 own
 data
 center,
 but
 it's
 going


to
 be
 whatever
 everyone
 else
 is
 doing.


We're
 now
 talking
 about
 the
 the
 LLM


stack,
 for
 example,
 that
 might
 be


custom.
 So,
 like
 they're
 just
 taking


whatever
 is
 there.
 They're
 they're
 not


reinventing
 that
 part
 cuz
 why
 would
 you?


Snap
 is
 a
 social
 media
 company.
 They


used
 they
 were
 very
 heavily
 I
 think


they're
 one
 of
 the
 biggest
 Google
 cloud


customers
 and
 kind
 of
 Google
 always


shows
 them
 off
 as
 like
 an
 example
 of


like
 someone
 who
 grew
 with
 them
 because


they
 could
 just
 throw
 money
 at
 Google


and
 optimize
 it
 later.
 And
 even
 Uber
 has


moved
 over
 to
 a
 mix
 of
 Oracle
 and
 and


Google
 Cloud
 from
 their
 own
 data


centers.
 So
 it
 probably
 helped
 Google


that
 they
 were
 early
 in
 the
 internet,


right?
 Like
 there
 were
 just
 no
 good


search
 engines
 back
 then.
 They
 were
 the


ones
 who
 built
 this.
 One
 thing
 I
 I
 have


to
 mention
 internal
 mobility.
 there's


there's
 just
 so
 much
 internal
 mobility


inside
 Google
 and
 there
 for
 large


companies
 there
 is
 usually
 some
 level
 of


internal
 mobility
 but
 as
 I
 understand


inside
 Google
 is
 just
 really
 easy
 to


move
 teams
 if
 you
 you're
 not
 in
 a
 bad


performance
 standing
 you
 can
 pretty
 much


move
 teams
 anytime
 as
 I
 understand
 and


and
 usually
 companies
 have
 a
 lot
 more


limitations
 on
 who
 can
 move
 or
 can


managers
 veto
 or
 not
 and
 here
 it's
 it's


a
 free-for-all
 so
 like
 people
 can
 switch


teams
 And
 people
 do
 switch
 teams
 a
 lot.


Like
 I
 think
 it's
 hard
 to
 talk
 with
 a


Googler
 who
 uh
 if
 if
 they've
 been
 there


for
 like
 10
 plus
 years
 if
 they've
 not


worked
 on
 several
 teams
 and
 and
 some
 and


sometimes
 changing
 teams
 like
 a
 few


years
 in
 a
 row
 like
 almost
 like
 and
 you


know
 knowing
 how
 big
 Google
 is
 like


these
 are
 like
 thousands
 of
 of
 teams


tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 teams
 actually
 and


yeah
 you
 can
 just
 go
 between
 them.


Obviously
 for
 smaller
 offices
 a
 bit


harder
 because
 there's
 not
 as
 many


around
 you
 but
 but
 still


>> yeah
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 slight


thing.
 So
 um
 just
 to
 mention
 during
 the


pandemic
 obviously
 Google
 started


working
 from
 home


just
 as
 as
 the
 rest
 of
 us
 and
 my


understanding
 is
 especially
 then
 the


internal
 mobility
 kind
 of
 like
 from
 and


maybe
 a
 bit
 after
 that
 kind
 of
 spiked
 a


bit
 as
 well.
 Again
 like
 most
 of
 us
 you


realize
 that
 like
 it's
 possible
 to
 do


this
 without
 being
 in
 offices.
 Uh,
 and


so
 I
 know
 of
 of
 folks
 who
 were
 able
 to


start
 working
 remotely
 for
 teams
 in
 new


locations.


>> Oh,
 so
 so
 they
 were
 able
 to
 do
 internal


mobility.
 Previously,
 you
 needed
 to
 be


in
 the
 same
 location.
 Now
 they
 could


remotely
 join
 that
 team
 for
 a
 while
 at


least.


>> Exactly.


>> I'm
 pretty
 sure
 that's
 going
 to
 go
 back


to
 where
 it
 was
 before
 slowly
 but


surely.


>> Yeah,
 cuz
 it
 does
 it
 has
 done
 that.
 like


they
 I
 mean
 Google
 now
 is
 I
 think
 almost


everyone's
 on
 a
 hybrid
 schedule
 where


they
 expect
 you
 to
 be
 in
 the
 office
 like


at
 least
 two
 three
 four
 times
 a
 week


probably
 depends
 on
 where
 you
 are
 and
 I


know
 there's
 some


>> follow
 your
 manager.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 like
 how
 important
 you
 are
 to


Google
 probably.


>> Speaking
 of
 exceptions,
 there
 is
 this


concept
 of
 singleton.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So
 a
 singleton
 is
 basically


a
 person
 who
 is
 on
 a
 team
 but
 like
 it's


the
 single
 person
 from
 that
 team
 working


in
 a
 new
 location
 essentially.
 Uh
 so
 if


there's
 a
 team
 say
 Whimo
 for
 instance


but
 they
 have
 like
 this
 one
 person
 who


really
 wanted
 to
 move
 somewhere
 else
 or


refuses
 to
 work
 there
 unless
 they
 can


work
 from
 that
 particular
 location.
 It's


like
 okay
 then
 you're
 a
 singleton.
 So


you
 might
 still
 work
 at
 a
 nearby
 Google


office,
 but
 you'll
 be
 the
 only
 person


like
 from
 that
 team
 working
 in
 that


office.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 guess
 it
 only
 makes
 sense.


These
 are
 senior
 people,
 people
 with


like
 key
 skills.
 Maybe
 if
 there
 was
 a


reorg,
 they
 were
 left
 there.
 Like
 you


need
 to
 be
 in
 demand
 typically
 for
 your


knowledge
 or
 your
 expertise.


>> It's
 not
 super
 common
 and
 uh
 it's


definitely
 an
 exception
 rather
 than
 a


rule,
 but
 uh
 like
 it
 does
 exist.
 One


more
 thing
 that
 is
 very
 unique
 about


Google
 is
 the
 non-stop
 rewrite
 like


everything
 is
 being
 re
 not
 everything


almost
 everything
 is
 is
 being
 written


every
 few
 years
 and
 this
 does
 happen
 to


some
 extent
 at
 most
 large
 companies
 but


with
 a
 lot
 slower
 pace
 I
 don't
 know
 if


it's
 the
 engineering
 enablement
 the
 fact


that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 new
 technologies


invented
 by
 Google
 as
 well
 right
 like


they
 they they
 created
 the
 go


programming
 language
 for
 example
 gRPC


protocol
 so
 so
 any
 open
 source


contributions
 or
 that
 the
 business
 is


changing
 that
 frequently.
 But
 because
 of


this,
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 and
 a
 bad


thing.
 Like
 if
 you
 work
 at
 Google,


you're
 going
 to
 be
 really
 good
 at


rewrites
 and
 migrations
 because
 with
 a


with
 a
 rewrite,
 there's
 usually
 a


migration
 as
 well
 and
 then
 deprecation.


And
 that's
 a
 good
 thing.
 The
 bad
 thing


is
 that
 this
 is
 not
 usually
 the
 work


that
 most
 engineers
 would
 want
 to
 sign


up
 for.
 You're
 excited
 about
 building


the
 new
 thing,
 but
 again,
 there
 there's


that
 thing
 when
 you
 build
 the
 new
 thing,


how
 are
 you
 going
 to
 get
 the
 customers


over
 there?


>> Yeah.
 But
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 like
 on
 on


two
 sides
 there
 because
 they
 have
 the


monor
 repo
 they
 have
 direct
 access
 to


like
 uh
 they
 can
 actually
 make
 they
 they


do
 have
 a
 tool
 called
 Rosie
 uh
 which
 is


a
 tool
 for
 doing
 like
 large
 scale
 uh


migrations.
 Well,
 with
 the
 migration,
 I


guess
 there's
 two
 parts,
 right?
 There's


a
 code
 rewrite
 itself,
 which
 is
 always


easier
 one,
 but
 you
 can
 automate
 that.


And
 then
 there's
 a
 data
 migration,
 which


is
 going
 to
 be
 the
 the
 tougher
 one,
 and


the
 more
 errorprone
 one,
 and
 the
 one


that
 you
 want
 to
 get
 right.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 that's
 a
 really
 useful
 skill
 to


learn
 because
 like
 usually
 most


engineers
 don't
 need
 to
 migrations
 all


the
 time,
 but
 when
 you
 do,
 you
 better


know
 how
 to
 do
 it
 properly
 and
 and
 with


the
 right
 steps
 and
 with
 the
 right


safety
 and
 planning.
 But
 once
 you've


done
 it
 a
 few
 times
 and
 you
 burnt


yourself,
 you
 know,
 you'll
 be


unstoppable.


>> Yeah.
 Either
 Google
 can
 be
 the
 worst


place
 for
 it
 because
 you
 do
 it
 all
 the


time
 or
 it's
 the
 best
 pace
 because
 they


do
 it
 all
 the
 time
 so
 they
 know
 what


they're
 doing.


>> But
 you
 can
 also
 move
 teams,
 right?
 So


on
 once
 you've
 done
 a
 migration,
 you're


seeing
 the
 next
 one's
 coming,
 you
 might


just
 move
 teams
 if
 you
 I
 mean,
 if
 you


did
 an
 okay
 job,
 it
 should
 be
 easy


enough.
 You
 you
 can
 look
 at
 it
 from


different
 ways.
 And
 obviously
 moving


teams
 I
 like
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 be
 a


bit
 more
 nuanced
 than
 that.
 You
 do
 need


a
 manager,
 a
 new
 manager
 who
 will
 be


supported.
 But
 as
 I
 understand
 with


Google,
 your
 current
 manager
 does
 not


need
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 ask
 for


permission.
 You
 can
 just
 move
 because
 if


you
 would,
 then
 that
 would
 tie
 people
 in


a
 lot
 more
 and
 you
 know,
 you
 could
 have


manager
 bias
 and
 all
 of
 those
 things.


>> Another
 one
 of
 the
 aspects
 of
 Google


being
 so
 big
 like
 we've
 mentioned
 that


they're
 basically
 different
 companies


operating
 in
 the
 same
 company.
 So
 that


is
 one
 thing
 to
 consider.
 So
 like
 if


you're
 you
 know
 if
 you've
 been
 at


another
 company
 and
 done
 internal


migrations
 and
 or
 uh
 yeah
 like
 move


teams
 also
 worth
 keeping
 in
 mind
 that


moving
 teams
 at
 Google
 might
 be
 a
 much


bigger
 shift
 but
 then
 again
 it's


probably
 a
 shift
 in
 like
 the
 tech
 stack


is
 obviously
 the
 same
 like
 you
 don't


it's
 not
 moving
 companies
 in
 the
 way


where
 you
 have
 to
 learn
 a
 completely
 new


tech
 stack
 and
 like
 how
 they
 use
 their


tools
 and
 all
 the
 different
 quirks
 of


like
 yeah
 you've
 done
 Kubernetes
 before


but
 how
 do
 they
 do
 you
 Kubernetes
 at


this
 new
 place
 rather
 the
 the
 thing
 that


you're
 gonna
 run
 into
 is
 probably
 more


on
 the
 how
 do
 you
 prioritize
 what
 are


the
 communication
 like
 all
 all
 the
 like


softer
 things
 might
 be
 very
 different
 uh


moving
 from
 team
 to
 team


>> and
 I
 guess
 one
 thing
 about
 Google
 that


is
 kind
 of
 special
 although
 a
 lot
 of


other
 companies
 do
 it
 these
 days
 but


just
 how
 much
 they
 contributed
 to
 open


source
 and
 the
 industry
 the
 broader


industry
 like
 some
 of
 the
 biggest


project
 that
 that
 they
 they
 have
 built


or
 open
 source
 or
 started
 and
 now
 are


still
 sponsoring
 and
 investing.


Kubernetes
 obviously
 one
 of the
 big
 huge


ones.
 Angular
 which
 react
 is
 now
 a
 lot


more
 popular
 but
 it's
 still
 it's
 I
 think


it's
 gaining
 popularity
 again
 and
 Google


is
 very
 heavy
 user
 of
 this
 front-end


framework.
 TensorFlow
 for
 machine


learning
 it's
 so
 widely
 used.
 I
 mean
 we


we
 cannot
 not
 mention
 the
 LLMs
 uh
 with


the
 that
 was
 not
 the
 technology
 but
 the


paper
 that
 that
 kickstarted
 all
 of
 this


with
 ascension
 is
 all
 you
 need
 the
 go


programming
 language
 chromium
 uh
 as
 the


the
 browser
 engine
 and
 just
 just
 so
 so


so
 many
 other
 things
 I
 think
 you
 know


Met
 Meta
 has
 a
 bunch
 of
 strong


contributions
 in
 Microsoft's
 in
 in


certain
 areas
 but
 I
 feel
 Google
 has
 a


really
 wide
 range
 from
 like
 backend


frameworks
 machine
 learning
 front


content
 frameworks,
 protocols.
 My
 sense


is
 that


overall
 they
 might
 be
 the
 single
 most


kind
 of
 contributor
 to
 like
 the
 kind
 of


broader
 open
 source
 ecosystem,


especially
 when
 you
 take
 the
 papers
 into


account
 that
 that
 kicked
 off
 even
 more


projects
 or
 or
 software
 businesses.


>> Yeah.
 And


inspired
 people
 as
 well.
 uh
 and
 like


looking
 through
 some
 of
 the
 papers


uh
 even
 from
 early
 on
 but
 even
 later


papers
 that
 I
 look
 at
 like
 they're
 also


very
 open
 with
 the
 just
 like
 learnings


of
 like
 what
 what
 works
 what
 doesn't


what
 should
 you
 take
 from
 this
 what


should
 you
 not
 take
 from
 this
 and
 I
 do


feel
 like
 and
 like
 I
 was
 reading
 through


some
 of
 their
 old
 like
 tech
 post
 blog


posts
 as
 well
 uh
 like
 they
 have
 like


they
 had
 a
 tech
 blog
 for
 or
 maybe
 just
 a


blog
 for
 like
 Gmails
 like
 the
 Gmail


email
 team
 had
 a
 blog
 that
 they
 wrote


from
 like
 2007
 to
 16
 where
 they
 just


talked
 about
 the
 time
 that
 Gmail
 went


down
 and
 they
 had
 to
 go
 in
 and
 recover


data
 from
 all
 their
 tapes.
 It
 seems
 like


they
 haven't
 ever
 or
 like
 they
 don't


think
 of
 sharing
 this
 information
 as


some
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 moat
 or
 something


they
 need
 to
 be
 secretive
 about
 because


like
 what
 would
 happen
 if
 other


companies
 copy
 us?
 I
 really
 like
 that


about
 Google
 actually.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


it
 used
 to
 be
 like
 that.
 I
 feel
 that


might
 be
 slowing
 or
 maybe
 there
 are
 just


not
 many
 blogs.
 I
 I
 don't
 remember
 like


any
 major
 engineering
 teams
 sharing,
 oh,


here's
 like
 cool
 learning.
 So,
 I
 think


that
 might
 have
 been
 the
 earlier
 years.


>> Yeah,
 it
 could
 have
 been.


>> Uh,
 and
 I
 think
 now
 it
 might
 be
 a
 bit


more
 controlled
 and
 there
 is
 no
 like
 one


Google
 engineering
 blog
 or
 I
 don't
 even


know
 of
 like
 some
 other
 teams,
 but
 still


for
 the
 open
 source
 for
 sure
 and
 for
 the


papers.
 So
 the
 the
 research
 and
 the
 open


source
 is
 there
 and
 I
 mean
 to
 be
 fair
 on


conferences
 Google
 speakers
 do
 show
 up


and
 they
 they
 do
 share
 they
 do
 talk.
 It


might
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 changing
 because


now
 Google
 does
 sell
 to
 developers.
 They


have
 some
 developer
 tools
 uh
 like
 like


Firebase


a
 lot
 of
 Google
 cloud.
 So
 now
 they
 do


have
 dedicated
 folks
 who
 are
 you
 know


Flutter
 is
 another
 good
 example
 like
 on


their
 those
 area
 they're
 kind
 of
 a
 lot


lot
 more
 active
 of
 sharing
 like
 all


right
 here's
 how
 to
 use
 it
 how
 to
 build


it
 etc.
 But
 but
 yeah,
 I
 still
 asked
 this


uh
 on
 on
 the
 podcast
 episode
 about


Kubernetes.
 Like
 I
 still
 didn't
 really


understand
 why
 did
 Google
 release


Kubernetes
 because
 they
 had
 Borg
 and
 it


worked
 really
 well
 for
 them.
 And
 so
 why


bother
 building
 something
 that
 they


didn't
 even
 use?
 Like
 they
 just
 put
 it


out
 like
 oh
 here's
 kind
 of
 some
 some


lessons
 from
 Borg
 that
 others
 can
 use.


And
 I
 think
 where
 we
 got
 to
 is
 that
 they


probably
 did
 it
 because
 well
 first
 of


all
 now
 looking
 back
 uh
 it
 was
 it
 was


good
 for
 their
 uh
 very
 good
 for
 their


cloud
 business
 to
 have
 a
 technology


where
 it's
 very
 easy
 to
 move
 from
 let's


say
 containers
 on
 AWS
 or
 Azure
 to
 GCP


also
 by
 by
 knowing
 this
 there's
 not
 much


harm


it
 wasn't
 too
 much
 investment
 for
 them


to
 do
 it
 but
 it
 now
 helps
 the


recognition
 of
 the
 brand
 it
 helps
 with


recruitment
 and
 it
 They
 and
 they're
 also


now
 pretty
 much
 steering
 the
 technology


that
 is
 the
 winner,
 Kubernetes.
 They


have
 a
 huge
 say
 in
 it.
 Like
 yes,
 it's


it's
 it's
 an
 independent
 organization


that's
 that's
 there,
 but
 most
 of
 the


contributors
 are
 still
 at
 Google,
 so


they
 actually
 have
 a
 pretty
 good
 say
 in


that.
 So,
 so,
 so
 maybe
 it's
 it's
 a
 mix


of
 these
 things,
 but
 it
 never
 felt
 to
 me


that
 it
 was
 like
 some
 sort
 of
 business


decision.
 It
 was
 probably
 some
 engineers


thinking
 like,
 it's
 a
 cool
 idea,
 why


not?
 And
 then
 you
 can
 you
 can
 justify


the
 business
 for
 it.
 So,
 like
 I
 wonder


if
 a
 lot
 of
 Google
 is
 like
 this,
 like


engineers
 are
 like,
 oh,
 here's
 here's
 an


idea.
 I'm
 like,
 okay,
 let's
 see
 if
 we


can
 justify
 some
 some
 business
 numbers.


>> One
 of
 the
 things
 again
 like
 we're
 doing


this
 research
 from
 the
 outside
 looking


in,
 right?
 Like
 we're
 able
 to
 get
 to
 the


stuff
 we
 can
 get
 to
 and
 we've
 talked
 to


people.
 Um,
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


has
 come
 up
 is
 definitely
 like
 the


culture
 is
 shifting.


uh
 like
 it
 there's
 like
 you
 know
 the


winds
 of
 change
 in
 Google
 um
 following


you
 know
 partially
 just
 like
 the
 vibes


of
 the
 industry
 as
 a
 whole
 but
 partially


very
 much
 internally
 also
 during
 the


pandemic
 you
 know
 they
 they
 had
 some
 big


leaks
 uh
 so
 like
 they
 stopped
 some


internal
 transparency
 in
 the
 all
 hands


and
 the
 full
 access
 to
 like
 everything


going
 on
 um
 like
 I
 know
 that's
 been


restricted.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 let's
 let's
 talk
 a
 bit
 more


about
 this
 because
 I
 I
 feel
 this
 is
 like


the
 Google
 of
 today.
 Basically,
 we've


kind
 of
 arrived
 from
 like
 where
 Google


started,
 how
 they
 built
 like
 all
 all


these
 cool
 things
 to
 what
 is
 Google
 like


today
 from
 from
 all
 all
 that
 we've


gathered
 and
 I
 guess
 maybe
 we
 should


just
 like
 reflect
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 how


the
 whole
 as
 you
 said
 the
 whole
 industry


has
 gone
 through
 a
 massive
 change
 which


was
 I
 mean
 there
 was
 a
 couple
 of
 like


kind
 of
 like
 left
 turn
 and
 right
 things.


First
 there
 was
 a
 pandemic
 which
 the


whole
 world
 thought
 would
 be
 would
 be
 a


disaster
 and
 then
 it
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 a


blessing
 for
 tech
 because
 everyone


started
 to
 hire
 like
 crazy
 and
 interest


rates
 were
 still
 down.
 Uh
 there
 was


close
 to
 zero
 interest
 rates
 in
 the
 US


and
 and
 worldwide
 on
 on
 borrowing
 money


for
 more
 than
 a
 decade
 and
 this
 was
 just


interest
 rates
 were
 just
 about
 to
 go
 up


before
 COVID
 and
 then
 because
 of
 COVID


every
 country
 cut
 it
 down
 to
 like
 zero


for
 another
 two
 years.
 So
 tech
 had
 this


thing
 where
 there
 were
 still
 like
 zero


interest
 rates
 meaning
 investors


couldn't
 really
 put
 their
 money
 anywhere


but
 like
 tech
 stocks
 or
 startup


investment
 uh
 tech
 had
 a
 big
 boom


everyone
 started
 to
 hire
 so
 this
 was
 a


great
 time
 and
 this
 was
 2020
 and
 2021
 I


I
 had
 so
 many
 friends
 and
 and
 former


colleagues
 who
 like
 got
 30
 40
 50%


compensation
 increases
 like
 just
 by


going
 to
 a
 company
 that
 did
 similar


things
 but
 they
 just
 raised
 money.
 It


was
 a
 great
 time
 and
 a
 really
 hard
 time


to
 hire
 or
 or
 to
 retain.
 People
 kept


leaving
 left
 and
 right.
 I
 heard
 of


hiring
 manager
 a
 hiring
 manager
 who
 had


a
 engineer
 sign
 and
 ready
 to
 join
 them


but
 they
 didn't
 didn't
 show
 up
 on
 the


first
 day
 and
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 called
 them


up
 and
 like
 oh
 yeah
 I
 got
 like
 a
 20%


higher
 offer.
 Sorry
 I'm
 I'm
 working


somewhere
 else
 now.
 And
 then
 this
 was


great
 for
 like
 a
 year
 or
 probably
 a
 bit


more
 than
 a
 year.
 And
 in
 2022,
 just
 as


lockdowns
 ended
 and
 the
 world
 recovered,


tech
 started
 to
 crash
 down.
 There
 was


like
 mass
 layoffs
 across
 companies.


There
 was
 I
 think
 it
 all
 started
 with


the
 fast
 bankruptcy.
 One
 click
 checkout


sort
 of
 fast
 just
 went
 bankrupt
 from


being
 one
 of the
 hottest
 companies
 in


tech
 to
 just
 bankrupt
 overnight
 and
 then


a
 bunch
 of
 other
 startups
 including
 like


stripe
 and
 some
 other
 like
 almost
 every


kind
 of
 large
 company
 did
 layoffs.
 And


this
 turned
 out
 later
 that
 as
 we
 look


back
 it
 it
 had
 to
 do
 with
 interest
 rates


rising
 and
 when
 interest
 rates
 went
 up


um
 this
 meant
 that
 companies
 and


investors
 looked
 for
 profitability.
 So


everyone
 suddenly
 focused
 on
 that
 and


there
 was
 a
 bunch
 of
 overhiring
 in
 the


previous
 year.
 So
 suddenly
 we
 had
 this


like
 dual
 shock
 effect
 of
 going
 from


everyone
 in
 tech
 is
 in
 demand
 and
 people


could
 not
 hire
 enough
 boot
 camp


graduates
 because
 there
 were
 not
 enough


university
 graduates
 to
 just
 layoff


shocks
 uh
 happening
 as
 well.
 A
 few


company
 bankruptcies
 and
 just
 a
 really


kind
 of
 negative
 vibe
 in
 the
 industry


and
 this
 was
 this
 went
 up
 all
 the
 way
 to


2023.
 Big
 tech
 had
 big
 layoffs
 and


Google
 had
 the
 first
 ever
 layoffs
 in


almost
 the
 first
 in
 company
 history.
 In


2008,
 they
 did
 like
 a
 3%
 layoff
 because


of
 the
 financial
 crisis.
 They
 then
 did


some
 layoffs
 after
 they
 bought
 Motorola


in
 2014.
 But
 since
 then,
 they
 they


haven't
 really
 had
 any
 layoffs.
 And


Google
 used
 to
 be
 known
 as
 the
 the
 place


with
 like
 great
 job
 security,
 work
 life


balance,
 almost
 impossible
 to
 get
 fired


if
 you
 do
 a
 a
 minimum
 good
 enough
 job.


And
 then
 they
 did
 like
 6%
 layoffs
 just


cutting
 people
 with
 like
 including


people
 with
 10
 15
 20
 years
 of
 experience


just
 sending
 an
 email
 to
 them
 at
 night.


And
 I
 think
 this
 really
 changed
 the
 mood


at
 Google.
 This
 was
 2023


and
 then
 in
 2024
 they
 they
 there
 were


some
 more
 layoffs
 coming
 in
 not
 as
 many


as
 before
 but
 it's
 now
 seems
 like
 that


kind
 of
 period
 of
 Google
 was
 perfect
 in


so
 many
 ways.
 perks,
 money,


work
 life
 balance,
 clubs,
 investing
 in


everything.
 Like
 it
 was
 just
 impossible


to
 hire
 away
 from
 Google
 pretty
 much.


Now
 there's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 sense
 of
 there
 is


some
 level
 of
 being
 cutthroat.
 Not
 as


much
 as
 their
 competitors
 like
 Meta
 or


Amazon
 where
 it's
 a
 lot
 more
 tougher,


but
 but
 still
 it's
 it's
 like,
 you
 know,


it's
 it's
 a
 company.
 At
 some
 point,
 you


might
 get
 fired
 and
 you'll
 get
 a
 good


severance,
 but
 they'll
 tell
 you
 that


it's
 it's
 game
 over.
 And
 maybe
 it's
 not


your
 fault
 either,
 but
 on
 on
 one
 end,


it's
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 change
 that
 hasn't


happened
 before.
 On
 the
 other
 end,
 I
 was


like,
 come
 on.
 You
 you
 cannot
 have
 it


all
 everything
 for
 the
 whole
 time.
 Like,


especially
 for
 like
 such
 a
 large


company.
 So,
 like
 one
 part
 of
 me
 is


like,
 well,
 I
 mean,
 it's
 kind
 of
 sad


that
 it's
 over,
 but
 my
 other
 sites
 and


at
 least
 startups
 have
 a
 chance.
 At


least
 they
 can
 point
 to
 one
 thing
 Google


does
 not
 do
 perfectly.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 it
 does
 seem
 like


they
 had
 a
 really
 good
 run
 for
 a
 while.


And
 like
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 pockets
 at


Google
 that
 is
 still
 probably
 a


fantastic
 place
 to
 work,
 but
 I
 do
 think


like
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 bubbles


bursting,
 but
 yeah,
 like
 vibe
 changes


and
 like
 part
 of
 that
 is
 the
 industry,


but
 like
 part
 of
 it
 is
 also
 just
 like


the
 actual
 products.
 Um
 so
 in
 terms
 of


like


uh
 you
 know
 YouTube
 was
 and
 is
 in
 many


ways
 the
 new
 TV
 like
 it
 is
 dominant.
 Um


but
 then
 Tik
 Tok
 comes
 along
 and


Tik
 Tok
 is
 you
 know
 much
 more
 focused
 on


the
 users
 and
 grabbing
 your
 attention


and
 getting
 you
 pulled
 in.
 Um
 whereas


like
 YouTube
 has
 definitely
 done
 that
 as


well
 but
 like
 not
 to
 the
 same
 extent
 in


terms
 of
 their
 shorts
 but
 then
 all
 of
 a


sudden
 like
 now
 YouTube
 has
 has
 and
 kind


of
 has
 to
 push
 for
 shorts
 because
 they


like
 now
 they're
 in
 the
 attention
 war


and
 similarly
 with


you
 know
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 there
 was
 much


more
 in
 like
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 public


stratosphere
 in
 terms
 of
 yeah
 it's
 like


oh
 Google
 sure
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 data
 and


they're
 sure
 doing
 things
 with
 it
 and


you
 know
 Google
 search
 results
 are
 like


a
 lot
 of
 them
 are
 sponsored
 this
 doesn't


feel
 great.
 So
 I
 think
 there
 there's
 a


bit
 of
 a
 shift
 as
 well
 in
 terms
 of
 just


you
 know
 like
 they
 don't
 yeah
 they
 they


cut
 the
 don't
 be
 evil
 but
 like
 maybe


they
 leaned
 into
 it
 as
 well.
 Who
 knows?


>> Well,
 but
 I
 think
 this
 is
 the
 part
 where


so
 I
 saw
 Manu
 Cornate
 who
 writes
 all
 the


all
 the
 the
 these
 comics.
 He
 was
 for
 12


years
 at
 Google.
 He
 then
 quit
 Google
 and


and
 joined
 Twitter
 and
 then
 lucky
 for


him
 he
 he
 joined
 right
 as
 Elon
 Musk


bought
 Twitter
 but
 he
 joined
 he
 told
 me


that
 he
 he
 loved
 Google
 because
 he
 over


the
 12
 years
 I
 think
 from
 2010
 to
 like


2022
 towards
 the
 end
 he
 started
 to


become
 disillusioned
 of
 Google
 because


he
 joined
 with
 you
 know
 he
 believed
 like


what
 they
 said
 the
 don't
 be
 evil
 the


make
 the
 world
 a
 better
 place
 the


whatever
 uh
 and
 you
 know
 build
 cool


stuff
 and
 then
 he
 started
 to
 see
 how
 a


lot
 of
 his
 comics
 started
 to
 become
 um


more
 reflective
 of
 how
 he's
 thinking
 of


just
 how
 like
 he
 had
 a
 comic
 of
 Google's


naming
 of
 the
 throwing
 darts,
 how
 it's


all
 chaotic.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 starting
 to


criticize
 a
 company
 where
 clearly
 like


there's
 a
 lot
 to
 criticize
 about
 Google.


But
 my
 my
 and
 some
 of
 the
 sometimes


profits
 started
 to
 come
 come
 up
 on
 on


some
 of
 his
 comics
 on
 how
 Google
 is


prioritizing
 profits.
 And
 so
 here
 here's


the
 thing
 like
 you
 know
 when
 you're


going
 up
 uh
 including
 at
 at
 Google
 like


you
 reach
 the
 L6
 level
 which
 is
 staff


engineer
 that's
 the
 same
 level
 as
 a


manager.
 Now
 if
 you
 think
 about
 it
 as
 a


software
 engineer
 you
 think
 like
 oh
 I


just
 want
 to
 think
 about
 the
 code
 my


colleagues
 and
 then
 as
 a
 manager
 you


need
 to
 think
 about
 the
 business
 and


your
 budgets
 and
 headcount
 and
 hiring


and
 firing.
 Now
 you're
 now
 paid
 the
 same


like
 as
 a
 staff
 engineer
 and
 a
 manager


is
 paid
 the
 same
 and
 they
 kind
 of
 are


expected
 similar
 things.
 So
 a
 manager
 or


one
 level
 up
 especially
 a
 senior
 staff


engineer
 is
 kind
 of
 expected
 to


understand
 where
 the
 you
 know
 like
 a
 bit


more
 of
 the
 managerial
 side
 where
 the


business
 lives
 and
 how
 it
 makes
 money


and
 one
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 anyone


working
 at
 Google
 or
 any
 other
 company


needs
 to
 understand
 is
 where
 does
 your


salary
 come
 from
 and
 how
 can
 Google
 keep


paying
 top
 of
 the
 market
 and
 it's
 to
 do


with
 their
 profits
 just
 keep
 increasing.


Uh
 it's
 ridiculous.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the


chart,
 every
 year
 Google
 grows
 about


about
 like
 15
 to
 20%
 in
 revenue,
 which


is
 which
 is
 bonkers
 because
 they're
 now


so
 big.
 They're
 making
 like
 300
 and


something
 billion
 dollars
 per
 per
 year.


But
 as
 long
 as
 that
 happens,
 things
 will


be
 good,
 right?
 There's
 not
 going
 to
 be


large
 layoffs.
 There
 will
 be
 large


bonuses,
 all
 the
 perks,
 new
 offices


built,
 etc.
 As
 soon
 as
 that
 slows
 or
 it


goes
 to
 zero,
 bad
 things
 will
 happen


because
 there
 will
 be
 uh
 layoffs
 and
 and


you
 know
 Google's
 doing
 everything
 to
 to


not
 make
 that
 happen.
 But
 eventually


that
 reality
 will
 creep
 in
 which
 is
 at


some
 point
 your
 job
 might
 involve


helping
 Google
 make
 more
 money
 so
 that


they
 can
 hit
 this
 thing
 or
 if
 it's
 not


making
 more
 money
 then
 help
 investors


believe
 that
 next
 year
 they
 will
 make


make
 more
 money
 which
 is
 has
 to
 do
 with


all
 of
 the
 things
 why
 Google
 is
 going


all
 in
 on
 AI
 or
 or
 if
 that
 doesn't
 help


then
 then
 tell
 them
 how
 you're
 going
 to


cut
 costs
 faster.
 So
 it
 I
 think
 at
 some


point
 both
 in
 the
 life
 of
 a
 company
 but


also
 in
 your
 seniority
 you
 cannot
 ignore


the
 business
 and
 then
 you
 cannot
 ignore


like
 how
 they
 make
 money
 how
 they
 will


make
 money
 will
 it
 naturally
 grow


without
 you
 doing
 anything
 because
 if
 so


you're
 in
 a
 good
 place
 or
 does
 Google


for
 example
 need
 to
 expand
 the
 areas


that
 it
 services
 which
 which
 will


include
 things
 that
 are
 controversial


right
 like
 like
 again
 like
 will
 it
 get


into
 military
 contracts
 and
 and
 the
 easy


answer
 will
 be
 no
 but
 now
 when
 when
 you


need
 to
 increase
 your
 revenue
 by
 20%
 and


by
 not
 saying
 by
 saying
 no
 to
 them,
 you


cannot
 do
 that.
 Then
 the
 there's
 all
 all


these
 things
 that
 that
 trickle
 down
 as


as
 a
 result
 of
 that.
 So


>> yeah,
 it's
 it's
 growing
 up
 in
 a
 in
 an


industry
 and
 in
 a
 an
 economy
 that
 only


goes
 up.


>> Well,
 then
 Google
 has
 it
 it
 went
 from


being
 a
 startup
 in
 a
 in
 a
 garage
 not


even
 30
 years
 ago.
 Wow.
 in
 1998
 like


just
 an
 idea
 to
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


companies
 in
 the
 world
 I
 think
 fourth


biggest
 company
 right
 now
 by
 market
 cap


and
 you
 know
 like
 how
 much
 more
 than
 can


you
 grow
 like
 I'm
 sure
 you
 can
 grow


right
 but
 but
 where
 is
 it
 like
 okay
 they


can
 now
 you
 know
 they
 can
 aim
 to


overtake
 right
 now
 it's
 Nvidia
 and
 Apple


and
 Microsoft
 ahead
 of
 them
 but
 but
 but


then
 what
 and
 will
 growth
 always
 always


continue
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 more
 of
 a


philosophical
 question
 but
 I
 think
 all


of
 big
 tech
 will
 eventually
 have
 to


reckon
 with
 this
 this
 question
 because


we
 went
 from
 tech
 companies
 being
 kind


of
 underdogs,
 you
 know,
 like
 there


there's
 people
 who
 still
 remember


Facebook
 just
 being
 an
 idea
 or
 or
 like


being
 be
 used
 by
 teenagers.
 Same
 same


thing
 with
 you
 know
 older
 older


listeners
 or
 or
 viewers
 when
 Google
 did


not
 exist
 to
 like
 yeah
 they
 they
 won
 and


now
 the
 question
 is
 how
 how
 do
 they
 keep


winning
 and
 eventually
 winning
 is


innovating
 but
 at
 some
 point
 it
 it
 might


be
 trying
 to
 lock
 out
 other
 competitors


which
 you
 know
 Google
 is
 being
 sued


right
 now
 by
 the
 US
 Department
 of


Justice
 for
 offering
 Apple
 a
 bunch
 of


money
 and
 for
 Apple
 accepting
 to
 be


their
 default
 search
 engine
 and
 not


having
 any
 competition
 on
 on
 let's
 say


iOS.
 It
 was
 interesting
 how
 things


change.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it
 is
 it's
 interesting.
 It's


like
 the
 the
 amount
 of
 power
 these


companies
 have
 as
 well.
 I
 personally


couldn't
 imagine
 life
 without
 Google


because
 like
 you
 know
 it's
 my
 calendar,


it's
 my
 email,
 it's
 like
 so
 yeah
 I
 have


a
 background
 in
 design
 and
 uh
 there's


this
 general
 idea
 in
 design
 that
 really


good
 design
 is
 design
 you
 don't
 notice


because
 it
 just
 becomes
 a
 seamless
 part


of
 your
 day-to-day
 experience
 like
 you


can
 point
 out
 bad
 design
 easily
 because


those
 are
 the
 things
 that
 you
 notice
 and


that
 provide
 friction
 in
 your
 life
 and


Google
 is
 like
 They
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 just
 you
 barely
 think
 of
 them


because
 they're
 so
 ingrained
 in
 your


life
 which
 means
 that
 you
 know
 they
 do


wield
 a
 lot
 of
 power
 like
 you
 know


you've
 probably
 had
 that
 you
 know
 when


they
 decide
 to
 change
 some
 aspect
 of


Google
 calendar
 or
 change
 you
 know
 a


color
 of
 something
 or
 whatever
 you
 know


you
 have
 like
 you
 can
 your
 whole
 day
 can


be
 completely
 thrown
 off.
 Yeah,
 and
 I
 I


think
 there's
 a
 good
 question
 because
 I


think
 so
 far
 a
 lot
 of
 what
 we
 talked


about
 Google
 and
 what
 makes
 Google


really
 unique
 is
 how
 they
 started.
 There


was
 a
 startup.
 It
 innovated
 so
 much.


They
 had
 20%
 time.
 They
 kind
 of
 got
 rid


of
 it
 in
 2013,
 so
 about
 10
 years
 ago.


The
 vibe
 is
 al
 also
 also
 changing.
 But


the
 reality
 is
 that
 anyone
 who
 joins


Google
 today,
 it's
 a
 very
 different


company
 than
 it
 would
 have
 been
 even
 10


years
 ago
 because
 there's
 a
 phase
 of


growing
 and
 innovating
 and
 there's
 now


pock
 there's
 pockets
 of
 innovation,


right?
 AI
 is
 still
 up
 for
 grabs.
 there's


a
 really
 open
 battle
 between
 uh
 all
 all


the
 leading
 AI
 companies
 including


Google
 and
 it's
 kind
 of
 fun
 and
 exciting


but
 there's
 also
 the
 areas
 that
 are
 just


one
 if
 you
 start
 to
 work
 on
 Gmail
 I
 mean


it's
 already
 market
 leading
 like
 what
 is


going
 to
 your
 mandate
 going
 to
 be
 it's


probably
 going
 to
 be
 I
 mean
 you
 know


keep
 existing
 users
 don't
 let
 them
 turn


uh
 or
 extract
 more
 money
 from
 them
 in


terms
 of
 ads
 because
 that's
 how
 you
 make


money
 or
 or
 upsell
 them
 to
 something
 but


it'll
 be
 mostly
 like
 maintenance
 and
 and


don't
 mess
 up
 or
 if
 it's
 a
 cash
 c


product
 like
 Google
 search.
 You
 know,
 we


we've
 now
 seen
 reports
 uh
 that
 some
 of


the
 executives
 knowingly
 kind
 of
 made


Google
 search
 worse
 to
 have
 people
 see


more
 ads
 to
 generate
 more
 revenue.
 But


the
 point
 is
 like
 working
 on
 a
 on
 a


product
 that
 has
 been
 built,
 it's
 been


proven,
 it's
 been
 innovated.


There's
 now
 very
 small
 innovations


compared
 to
 what
 it
 used
 to
 be
 like.
 And


and
 so
 at
 some
 point
 I
 and
 which
 I
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 a
 necessarily
 a
 bad


thing
 by
 the
 way,
 but
 at
 some
 point
 this


this
 thing
 comes
 where
 like
 okay
 like
 if


you
 want
 to
 work
 on
 something
 that
 used


to
 be
 like
 the
 old
 Google,
 it's
 probably


going
 to
 be
 startup
 or
 if
 you're
 lucky


it'll
 be
 a
 team
 inside
 of
 Google
 that


has
 a
 green
 field
 project
 again
 like


like
 all
 of
 those
 things
 happen
 all
 the


time.
 But
 but
 yeah,
 but
 for
 some
 of
 the


the
 big
 areas,
 it's
 it's
 different
 work


to
 to
 work
 there.
 And
 this
 is
 by
 the
 way


how
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 few
 ways
 we
 used


to
 be
 able
 to
 when
 I
 was
 working
 at
 Uber


and
 we
 were
 a
 lot
 smaller
 than
 Google


how
 we
 used
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 people


with
 Google
 offers
 with
 stronger
 overall


compensation
 numbers
 accept
 us
 cuz
 we


would
 tell
 them
 like
 look
 you
 can


totally
 go
 to
 Google
 like
 get
 paid


really
 well
 and
 all
 that
 and
 you
 know


you
 can
 be
 a
 cog
 there
 like
 you
 know


like
 do
 your
 little
 small
 little
 thing


you
 know
 like
 tweak
 a
 few
 things
 and


just
 be
 unsatisfied
 with
 your
 work
 or


you
 can
 come
 here
 you
 you
 can
 get
 less


less
 cash
 but
 like
 here's
 all
 this
 stock


which
 you
 know
 it's
 it's
 the
 same
 we


promise
 well
 I
 mean
 but
 we
 couldn't


promise
 but
 that's
 that's
 the
 nature
 of


stock
 but
 if
 everything
 goes
 well
 you'll


have
 this
 huge
 impact
 here
 you
 know


you'll
 have
 the
 coc
 your
 work
 or
 or
 your


your
 like
 everyone
 uh
 and
 we're
 building


something
 new
 and
 you'll
 have
 freedom


and
 that
 was
 the
 thing
 that
 made
 a
 lot


of
 people
 do
 it
 in
 fact
 I
 think
 that's


the
 reason
 that
 people
 will
 leave
 this


really
 cushy
 cushy
 place
 called
 Google


is
 if
 they
 just
 get
 a
 little
 bored
 and


they
 feel
 that
 they
 could
 do
 so
 much


more


>> obviously
 in
 like
 there's
 always


innovation
 uh
 but
 just
 like
 it
 just


looks
 different
 today
 I
 think
 and
 the


scale
 of
 it
 is
 different
 because
 I
 mean


yeah
 like
 Google
 calendar
 does
 come
 out


with
 new
 fun
 things
 fairly
 often
 and
 you


know
 there's
 new
 features
 in
 Google


meets
 and
 Google
 chat
 and
 and
 all
 these


things
 but
 it's
 yeah
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 much


smaller
 scale
 uh
 so
 I
 think
 it's
 like


You
 can
 definitely
 still
 be
 like
 do
 fun


innovative
 stuff
 at
 Google,
 but
 it's


yeah,
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 new


Gmail.


>> So,
 so
 let's
 talk
 about
 who
 do
 you
 think


would
 be
 a
 good
 fit
 at
 Google?
 Like
 who


are
 people
 who
 could
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 out
 of


it
 in
 today's
 Google?
 Like
 not
 not
 not


the
 ideal
 Google,
 but
 the
 one
 that
 that


that
 we
 know
 today
 who
 could
 get
 a
 bunch


of
 value
 out
 of
 working
 there.
 And
 when


could
 be
 a
 good
 time
 assuming
 you
 manage


to
 get
 in
 because
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be


clear
 getting
 in
 is
 is
 super
 hard
 but


for
 for
 those
 there
 what
 could
 be
 good


question
 to
 ask
 of
 like
 am
 I
 in
 the


right
 place
 or
 or
 should
 I
 use
 this


privilege
 that
 I'm
 working
 at
 Google


because
 once
 you're
 at
 Google
 it's
 so


much
 easier
 to
 go
 anywhere
 and
 maybe


explore
 some
 other
 avenues.
 There
 are


some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we've
 been
 sort


of
 talking
 about
 the
 whole
 episode.
 Like


if
 you're
 really


super
 into
 the
 specific
 tech
 stacks
 and


trying
 new
 tools
 and
 playing
 around
 with


new
 frameworks
 the
 second
 they
 get
 out,


you
 know,
 Google
 is
 not
 for
 you.


Basically,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able


to
 use
 or
 reuse
 any
 of
 your
 like


triedand-true


favorite
 things
 because
 you're
 going
 to


be
 working
 at
 with
 completely
 different


things
 at
 Google.


>> So,
 you're
 you're
 you're
 basically


saying
 like
 if
 you're
 interested
 in
 the


frameworks
 in
 the
 industry
 that
 startups


use
 that
 that
 you
 build
 up
 the
 knowledge


that
 I
 don't
 know
 like
 the
 latest
 React


framework
 or
 latest
 ML
 framework
 that
 is


out
 there
 that
 makes
 you
 in
 demand
 for


other
 places.
 Right.


>> Exactly.
 So
 if
 you
 like
 keeping
 up
 with


the
 industry
 like
 keeping
 up
 with
 the


tech
 industry's
 cutting
 edge
 as
 opposed


to
 internal
 Google
 cutting
 edge
 that
 no


one
 knows
 except
 for
 Google
 but
 then
 you


might
 not
 be
 able
 to
 talk
 about
 it


because
 of
 the
 NDA
 and
 who
 know


>> exactly.
 Uh
 so
 that's
 one
 part
 of
 it.


Another
 part
 like
 if
 you're
 someone
 who


like
 who
 is
 not
 into
 reorgs
 or
 like


things
 changing
 all
 the
 time
 like
 the


googly
 thing
 of
 being
 into
 ambiguity


like
 if
 you
 like
 things
 being
 somewhat


like
 stable
 and
 yeah
 then
 Google
 is


probably
 not
 for
 you
 either.


>> It's
 interesting
 because
 the
 the


perception
 outside
 will
 be
 Google
 is


stable
 as
 a
 whole.
 I
 mean
 maybe
 teams


change
 but
 you're
 saying
 you
 know
 things


change
 so
 just
 get
 used
 to
 like
 you're


you
 might
 get
 new
 managers
 or
 several
 a


year.


>> Yeah
 exactly
 like
 reorgs
 are
 a
 staple.


>> Yeah
 I
 actually
 I
 think
 I
 talked
 with


someone
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Google
 who
 said


like
 I
 had
 like
 you
 know
 like
 seven


managers
 in
 a
 six
 managers
 in
 a
 span
 of


a
 year.
 It
 was
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 was


someone
 pretty
 senior
 so
 like
 was
 being


thrown
 around
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 yeah.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 on
 the
 flip
 side
 of
 that,


I
 think
 if
 you
 if
 you
 do
 like
 trying
 new


things
 and
 innovating
 and
 trying
 things


out,


like
 I
 think
 Google
 is
 good
 for
 that
 as


well.
 You
 know,
 like
 you
 mentioned,
 they


did,
 you
 know,
 20%
 time
 was
 way
 more
 of


an
 established
 thing
 in
 the
 past.
 Like


they
 didn't
 completely
 get
 rid
 of
 it.
 It


more
 phased
 out.
 it
 more
 became
 like
 100


to
 20%
 time
 where
 you
 can
 work
 on
 things


but
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 you
 know
 in


addition
 to
 your
 normal
 work
 but
 they
 do


also
 keep
 they
 have
 some
 like
 incubator


type
 teams
 at
 Google
 still
 uh
 they
 have


one
 thing
 called
 area
 120
 you
 know
 they


build
 completely
 new
 very
 like


startupbased
 completely
 new
 apps
 uh
 that


very
 quickly
 like
 often
 just
 transition


straight
 into
 the
 killed
 by
 Google


graveyard.
 Uh
 but
 you
 know
 they'll


probably
 like
 they
 will
 reuse
 some
 of


this
 technology
 as
 well.
 So
 like
 like


there
 is
 a
 like
 killed
 by
 Google
 is


definitely
 true
 but
 it's
 not
 like
 all
 of


it's
 wasted
 like
 they
 have
 they
 yeah


they've
 done
 so
 many
 chat
 apps
 and
 so


many
 social
 network
 type
 things
 where


the
 products
 didn't
 survive
 but
 the


technology
 got
 you
 know
 it
 got


incorporated
 into
 what's
 Google
 chat
 now


and
 Google
 meets
 and
 you
 know
 so
 like
 if


you're
 into
 innovation
 and
 trying
 new


things
 Google
 can
 be
 for
 you
 but
 it's


not
 it's
 probably
 also
 not
 going
 to
 look


the
 way
 that
 you
 imagine.
 it
 to
 look


like
 and
 if
 you
 get
 in
 love
 with
 your


idea
 and
 you
 know
 the
 whole
 I
 kill
 your


darlings
 thing.
 If
 you're
 not
 good
 at


killing
 your
 darlings
 then
 probably
 just


do
 startups
 instead
 of
 Google.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 one
 thing
 I'll
 add
 is
 Google


is
 very
 very
 good
 for
 one
 thing
 which
 is


the
 pedigree.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 if
 you


worked
 at
 Google
 for
 let's
 say
 you
 know


sometime
 even
 a
 year
 it's
 one
 of
 the


most
 recognized
 brands
 even
 to
 date
 like


there
 are
 some
 other
 companies
 that
 are


that
 you
 know
 keep
 going
 up
 and
 down


right
 now.
 Open
 AAI
 for
 example
 is
 is


also
 very
 very
 recognized
 and
 of
 course


you
 know
 Meta
 but
 Google
 has
 been
 like


this
 for
 almost
 30
 years
 almost
 since


the
 since
 the
 beginning
 and
 it
 continues


to
 be
 and
 part
 of
 it
 is
 the
 bar
 of


getting
 in
 is
 just
 very
 high.
 So
 there's


this
 thing
 I
 think
 this
 this
 it's
 kind


of
 funny
 that
 we're
 saying
 that
 should


you
 work
 or
 should
 you
 not
 well
 first
 of


all
 like
 can
 you
 get
 an
 offer
 because


most
 people
 unfortunately
 cannot
 and


this
 is
 made
 even
 worse
 that
 Google's


headcount
 has
 been
 flat
 pretty
 much
 in


fact
 likely
 declining
 since
 the
 last
 3


years
 which
 has
 never
 happened
 before
 so


until
 then
 they
 were
 growing
 basically


it
 was
 easier
 to
 get
 in
 uh
 considering


assuming
 the
 same
 number
 of
 candidates


applying
 every
 year.
 So
 it
 is
 kind
 of


getting
 harder
 to
 to
 get
 into
 Google.
 So


it's
 not
 taking
 for
 granted.
 So
 like
 my


suggestion
 would
 be
 is
 if
 there's
 a


reach
 out
 from
 a
 company
 like
 Google,
 it


can
 be
 a
 challenge
 to
 just
 go
 through


the
 interview
 process
 even
 if
 you
 have


no
 intention
 because
 their
 interview


process
 is
 very
 very
 similar
 to
 the


interview
 process
 of
 the
 companies
 that


are
 hardest
 to
 get
 into
 including
 the


scaleups
 and
 startups
 that
 are
 super


hot.
 Open
 AAI
 and
 traffic.
 they
 will


hire
 very
 similarly
 than
 how
 they
 hire


from
 Google.
 And
 then
 there's
 this
 other


interesting
 thing.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 where


the
 hottest
 startups
 of
 today
 hire
 from,


you
 know,
 may
 may
 this
 be
 open
 AI,


entropic
 as
 I
 mentioned,
 Ram,
 Stripe,


so
 many
 of
 them
 will
 be
 from
 Google.


Like
 Google
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who
 are


underutilized,
 but
 they're
 very
 smart


and
 very
 capable.
 And
 the
 companies
 that


can
 pay
 more
 than
 Google
 or
 can
 match
 it


or
 can
 have
 a
 bigger
 promise
 with
 equity


will
 will
 often
 just
 take
 the
 shortcut


instead
 of
 interviewing
 you
 know
 so
 many


people
 with
 with
 with
 no
 proven
 tracker


just
 go
 go
 to
 the
 source.
 So
 that's
 one.


And
 then
 there's
 a
 network.
 Uh
 because


if
 you're
 someone
 who
 is
 is
 curious
 or


talks
 with
 other
 people
 inside
 Google,


you
 can
 build
 up
 a
 really
 good
 network.


Just
 getting
 to
 know
 people.
 Uh
 the
 ex


Google
 network
 is
 very
 strong.
 The
 the


fact
 that
 there's
 a
 Sugler
 network
 who


as
 I
 understand
 they
 they
 help
 each


other.
 There's
 like
 investment
 networks


and
 all
 these
 things.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 the


opportunity
 to
 potentially
 get
 into


Google,
 see
 if
 you
 can
 and
 then
 decide


if
 if
 you
 want
 to
 do
 that.
 Having
 it


behind
 your
 back,
 it
 it
 it
 can
 it
 can


strengthen
 your
 your
 your
 resume
 and


your
 opportunities
 for
 for
 like
 a
 decade


or
 even
 more
 to
 come.
 You
 can
 always
 say


you're
 ex
 Googler
 and
 the
 thing
 is
 not


many
 people
 will
 be
 able
 to
 say
 that


globally.
 So
 especially
 as
 as
 a
 software


engineer.
 So
 yes,
 one
 more
 thing
 to
 keep


in
 mind.


>> I
 know
 it's
 changed
 but
 like
 there
 is


one
 thing
 of
 like
 interviewing
 with


Google
 like
 it
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 funnel.
 So


like
 there
 are
 some
 of
 the
 uh
 interview


process
 that's
 just
 like
 you
 know
 get


get
 your
 foot
 in
 the
 door
 to
 begin
 with


and
 then
 like
 once
 you're
 in
 there
 like


I
 do
 think
 you
 still
 have
 somewhat
 of
 a


choice
 and
 you
 know
 you
 get
 to
 talk
 to


some
 a
 few
 different
 teams
 at
 least
 you


used
 to
 like
 talk
 to
 a
 few
 different


teams
 like
 see
 the
 vibes
 before
 you
 like


uh
 jump
 on
 fully.


>> Yep.
 And
 Google
 that
 has
 this


interesting
 thing
 called
 team
 matching


which
 is
 for
 software
 engineering


positions
 typically
 they
 don't
 interview


for
 a
 specific
 team
 but
 they
 interview


in
 general.
 And
 once
 they
 decide
 like


all
 right
 you're
 good
 you
 meet
 our
 you


meet
 our
 our
 bar.
 Then
 a
 team
 needs
 to


claim
 you.
 So
 you
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 go


through
 a
 team
 matching
 process
 which


can
 be
 really
 frustrating
 by
 the
 way.


The
 recruiter
 might
 tell
 you
 like


congratulations
 we
 want
 to
 hire
 you.
 and


you're
 like
 great
 where
 can
 I
 like
 how


much
 is
 the
 compensation
 how
 are
 I


signing
 like
 we
 just
 need
 to
 go
 through


team
 matching
 and
 sometimes
 this
 team


matching
 can
 take
 months
 and
 sometimes


it
 comes
 back
 with
 I'm
 sorry
 no
 teams


were
 available
 or
 or
 wanted
 your
 profile


in
 in
 this
 case
 so
 that's
 the
 other


thing
 it
 it
 is
 it's
 kind
 of
 it's
 kind
 of


harder
 to
 get
 into
 than
 most
 places
 and


I've
 heard
 that
 recently
 uh
 about
 like


six
 months
 ago
 this
 happened
 that
 uh
 a


bunch
 of
 people
 were
 rejected
 and
 and


very
 disappointed
 that
 they
 couldn't
 get


into
 So,
 it's
 it's
 one
 one
 one
 of
 these


things.
 Again,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it


can
 be
 frustratingly
 hard
 to
 get
 in
 when


you
 want
 to
 get
 in.
 Uh
 but
 again,
 uh


it's
 good
 to
 know
 cuz
 I
 hope
 that
 we


were
 able
 to
 share
 some
 details
 cuz
 it


this
 environment
 really
 is
 not
 for
 a
 lot


of
 people.
 And
 you
 do
 need
 to
 put
 up


with
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 that
 come


with
 with
 large
 companies.
 Uh
 and
 in


this
 case,
 a
 one
 that
 is
 very


transparent,
 which
 means
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 information
 overload
 as
 well.
 Oh,


yeah.
 I
 think
 if
 if
 you're
 if
 you're
 not


good
 at
 like
 multitasking
 or
 if
 it


stresses
 you
 out
 to
 like
 have
 to
 go
 to


meeting
 middle
 of
 the
 day
 while
 while


coding,
 you'll
 probably
 hate
 this
 place


probably.


>> Yeah.
 Again,
 like
 maybe
 there's
 a
 pocket


somewhere.
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 some
 team,


but
 in
 general.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 guess
 that


also
 would
 maybe
 be
 like
 my
 last


reflection
 on
 who
 would
 fit
 at
 Google.


Like
 it
 is
 a
 big
 company.
 It
 is
 so
 big.


There's
 so
 many
 people.
 Again,
 like
 I


was
 there
 for
 like
 not
 even
 four
 months.


And
 in
 that
 time
 I
 I
 met
 so
 many
 people


and
 like
 yeah
 if
 you
 go
 to
 an
 afterwork


and
 meet
 someone
 it's
 like
 yeah
 you're


talking
 to
 someone
 who
 might
 as
 well
 be


at
 a
 completely
 different
 company.
 And


also
 like
 when
 I
 left
 and
 then
 after


like
 after
 a
 couple
 months
 I
 happened
 to


be
 in
 London
 again
 and
 I
 like
 went
 to


the
 office
 and
 visited
 and
 like
 in
 just


like
 four
 or
 five
 months
 like
 I
 I


recognized
 like
 almost
 no
 one
 and
 the


people
 I
 knew
 it's
 like
 no
 they'd


already
 moved
 or
 actually
 like
 this
 used


to
 be
 the
 case
 where
 the
 London
 office


used
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 a
 holding
 hub
 as
 well


like
 people
 would
 be
 hired
 and
 then
 go


to
 the
 London
 office
 for
 a
 year
 and
 then


they
 would
 move
 to
 the
 zur
 IC
 office
 cuz


like
 immigration
 wise
 that
 was
 easier


from
 a
 lot
 of
 company
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


countries
 and
 so
 there
 was
 just
 this


constant
 flux
 of
 like
 new
 people,
 old


people.
 It's
 like
 oh
 where
 are
 those


people?
 No,
 they
 moved.
 And
 if
 that's


not
 your
 vibe,
 if
 you
 like
 like
 knowing


your
 co-workers
 and
 feeling
 like
 oh
 this


is
 like
 a
 nice


space
 where
 like
 you
 know
 it's
 fairly


stable
 then
 uh
 yeah
 and
 Google's


probably
 not
 for
 you.
 Interestingly,


Google
 is
 one
 of
 the
 very
 few
 tech


companies
 who
 are
 very
 innovative.
 They


come
 up
 with
 so
 many
 new
 products
 even


today
 like
 an
 AI
 that
 they're
 they're


leading.
 They're
 a
 frontier
 lab.
 They're


one
 of
 the
 few
 companies
 who
 build
 their


own
 model.
 Microsoft
 doesn't
 even
 do


that
 or
 if
 they
 do,
 they're
 they're
 kind


of
 hiding
 it.
 But
 they're
 also
 a
 company


where
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 retire
 from.
 So,


this
 is
 the
 company
 where
 it's
 it's
 not


unusual
 to
 see
 people
 with
 20
 plus
 years


of
 having
 worked
 there.
 And
 when
 you


look
 closer,
 it'll
 be
 different
 teams.


They
 will
 switch
 teams
 every
 now
 and


then.
 positions
 some
 sometimes
 you
 know


they'll
 go
 from
 engineer
 to
 sometimes


TLM
 sometimes
 to
 PM
 and
 back
 so
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 mobility
 but
 it
 is
 one
 of
 the


places
 together
 with
 maybe
 Microsoft
 to


some
 extent
 Amazon
 where
 like
 I
 do
 see


people
 probably
 in
 larger
 amounts
 or


larger
 percentages
 just
 stay
 there
 and


clearly
 decide
 either
 that
 they're


they're
 very
 happy
 there
 or
 that
 they're


the
 happiest
 they
 they
 can
 be
 compared


to
 other
 options
 and
 they
 do
 it
 all
 the


way
 to
 retirement
 and
 because
 Google


pays
 as
 well
 as
 as
 it
 does.
 Retirement


doesn't
 necessarily
 come
 at
 the
 around


65
 or
 whatever
 the
 legally
 mandated
 is.


A
 lot
 of
 people
 will
 say
 I'm
 retired


earlier
 because
 I
 have
 saved
 off
 enough


together
 with
 with
 Google's
 perks
 and


pension
 program
 and
 and
 whatever
 that
 I


will
 now
 have
 a
 very
 comfortable
 life.


And
 and
 you
 see
 people
 in
 their
 you
 know


like
 50s
 or
 so
 say
 that
 they
 are
 like


early
 retiring
 after
 a
 decade
 or
 or
 more


at
 Google.
 And
 some
 of
 this
 has
 to
 do


with
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 bias
 that
 like
 10
 or
 20


years
 ago
 joining
 Google
 getting
 stock


meant
 that
 the
 the
 valuation
 brought
 it


up.
 But
 again,
 it's
 it's
 rare
 to
 see
 uh


companies
 like
 this.
 So
 that's
 that's


just
 kind
 of
 an
 interesting
 positive.


And
 you
 know,
 maybe
 similar
 to
 banks


used
 to
 be
 places
 like
 this
 where
 like


in
 tech
 divisions
 when
 when
 I
 I
 worked


at
 JP
 Morgan,
 it
 was
 pretty
 common
 for


people
 to
 retire
 from
 there
 because
 it


was
 stable,
 it
 was
 predictable,
 and


there
 were
 some
 lifers
 as
 as
 we
 called


them.
 But
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 it
 just
 shows


the
 tech
 industry
 is
 changing.
 You
 know


now
 there
 are
 stable
 companies
 to


startups
 that
 turn
 into
 stable
 companies


that
 are
 still
 in
 innovating
 but
 they


kind
 of
 won
 their
 market.
 So
 and
 Google


is
 definitely
 one
 of
 them
 in
 in
 some
 of


parts
 and
 in
 some
 pockets
 very
 exciting


and
 and
 doing
 a
 bunch
 of
 interesting


stuff.


>> We've
 just
 spent
 how
 many
 hours
 talking


about
 Google?


>> About
 three.


>> Yeah.
 We
 could
 probably
 go
 on
 and
 we
 we


do
 have
 you
 know
 we
 have
 written
 deep


dives
 to
 accompany
 this
 podcast.
 But
 if


you
 want
 to
 go
 in
 even
 more
 detail
 about


some
 of
 this
 stuff,
 go
 check
 out
 the


deep
 dive
 articles.
 We'll
 have
 lots
 of


links.
 And
 again,
 because
 Google
 is
 so


open,
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 re
 like
 a
 lot
 of


this
 data
 you'll
 just
 be
 able
 to
 find


like
 you
 can
 find
 the
 papers
 we've


talked
 about.
 You
 can
 read
 the
 books
 we


mentioned.


>> And
 and
 that's
 the
 thing.
 Uh
 one
 one


thing
 that
 I
 would
 just
 close
 with
 is
 we


could
 go
 on.
 We're
 we're
 trying
 to
 cap


it
 at
 a
 at
 a
 reasonable
 length
 as
 as


reasonable
 as
 it
 got.
 And
 we
 do
 have


more
 structured
 notes
 in
 the
 show
 notes


below
 uh
 that
 that
 we're
 linking
 in
 the


pragmatic
 engineer
 deep
 dives
 as
 well
 in


previous
 deep
 dives.
 But
 don't
 forget


that
 for
 every
 company
 that
 is
 a
 large


company.
 It's
 it's
 not
 just
 one
 place.


There's
 so
 many
 different
 teams
 and


everything
 that
 we
 might
 have
 said
 or


covered
 about
 how
 things
 generically


work.
 It
 might
 be
 absolutely
 false
 for


for
 one
 for
 that
 specific
 team
 that
 you


might
 be
 working
 in
 or
 or
 that
 your


friend
 is
 working
 in.
 So
 don't
 forget


like
 I
 think
 personal
 relationships


really
 do
 matter.
 And
 what
 I
 have
 seen


you
 know
 pe
 reason re
 reasons
 people
 go


to
 Google
 for
 example
 or
 leave
 Google


might
 be
 their
 manager.
 They
 had
 an


amazing
 manager
 at
 a
 company
 and
 they


happen
 to
 move
 to
 Google
 and
 then
 they


they
 followed
 them
 and
 the
 other
 other


way
 around.
 So
 you
 know
 people
 come
 and


go
 between
 uh
 companies
 like
 like


Google,
 Meta,
 big
 tech,
 startups
 and


scaleups
 and
 there
 are
 some
 things
 that


can
 be
 generalized
 but
 yeah
 don't
 forget


if
 if
 you
 meet
 interesting
 and
 valuable


uh
 people
 just
 you
 know
 keep
 in
 touch


with
 them
 because
 they
 might
 they
 might


end
 up
 in
 interesting
 places
 that
 might


or
 might
 not
 be
 like
 these.
 And
 I
 hope


that
 these
 details
 were
 interesting
 and


and
 probably
 collected
 for
 the
 first


time
 in
 in
 this
 format.
 This
 was
 an


experiment
 for
 us
 as
 well.
 So,
 let
 us


know
 what
 you
 think
 of
 it.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 fun,
 a
 lot
 of


information,
 but
 uh
 yeah,
 hopefully


we'll
 do
 this
 again
 with
 uh
 other
 topics


in
 the
 future.


>> Yeah,
 let
 let
 us
 know
 your
 feedback
 and


hopefully
 we'll
 see
 you
 in
 the
 next
 one.
