The
 spirit
 of
 the
 book
 is
 it's
 hard
 for


me.
 It's
 hard
 to
 grab
 on
 to.
 I
 think
 lot


lots
 of
 feelings,
 lots
 of
 things
 that


made
 me
 feel.
 But
 what
 would
 you
 say
 was


the
 the
 inherent
 spirit
 that
 you
 were


able
 to
 transfer
 over
 to
 the
 film?


>> Oh,
 I
 I
 think
 I
 would
 kill
 it
 if
 I
 tried


to
 put
 it
 into
 into
 like
 a
 sentence
 or


two
 here.


>> The
 life
 of
 man.
 Something
 something.


>> Exactly.
 Yeah.
 Exactly.


>> I'm
 Gilbert
 Cruz.
 This
 is
 the
 book


review
 from
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 and
 it's


Oscar
 season.


I
 love
 the
 Oscars.
 I've
 loved
 them
 my


entire
 life.
 This
 year
 I've
 already
 seen


eight
 of
 the
 10
 best
 picture
 nominees.


On
 our
 last
 episode,
 I
 had
 the
 chance
 to


speak
 with
 GMO
 Del
 Toro
 about
 his


adaptation
 of
 Mary
 Shel's
 Frankenstein.


And
 today
 we
 have
 another
 Oscar
 nominee


on
 the
 show,
 Clint
 Bentley.
 Uh
 Clint
 is


the
 director
 and
 the
 co-writer
 of
 Train


Dreams,
 which
 is
 a
 film
 that
 he
 adapted


from
 the
 2011
 Dennis
 Johnson
 nolla
 of


the
 same
 name.
 Both
 tell
 the
 story
 of


Robert
 Grerier.
 Robert
 is
 a
 a
 logger.


He's
 a
 rail
 worker.
 He
 lives
 in
 the


Pacific
 Northwest
 in
 the
 early
 20th


century.
 And
 it's
 basically
 his
 life.
 He


he
 works.
 He
 falls
 in
 love.
 He
 has
 a


child.
 He
 suffers
 a
 tragedy.
 uh
 he


grieavves
 at
 tragedy.
 Uh
 like
 any
 of
 us,


he
 experiences


things
 both
 grand
 and
 trivial.
 Uh
 and


and
 I
 was
 moved
 greatly
 by
 both
 the
 book


and
 the
 film,
 but
 in
 very
 different


ways.
 And
 the
 film
 for
 its
 part
 is


nominated
 for
 four
 Oscars,
 including
 the


big
 one,
 best
 picture,
 and
 best
 adapted


screenplay.


>> So
 when
 I
 talked
 with
 Clint,
 we
 went


right
 to
 the
 source.
 So
 let's
 start
 by


talking
 about
 the
 man.
 Let's
 talk
 about


Dennis
 Johnson.
 When
 the
 New
 York
 Times


pulled
 500
 authors
 and
 other
 literary


figures
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 the
 great


books
 of
 this
 century
 so
 far
 on,
 two
 of


those
 100
 books
 were
 by
 Dennis
 Johnson.


Tree
 of
 Smoke,
 which
 is
 this
 large,


sprawling
 700page
 book
 set
 during
 the


Vietnam
 War.
 And
 then
 all
 the
 way
 on
 the


other
 end
 of
 the
 spectrum,
 you
 have


Train
 Dreams,
 which
 is
 this
 short
 but


extremely
 powerful
 book
 about
 this
 man's


life,
 Robert
 Grineer.
 When
 did
 you
 first


encounter
 Dennis
 Johnson?


>> I
 first
 encountered
 his
 writing
 actually


through
 Train
 Dreams
 the
 year
 that
 it


came
 out.
 I
 knew
 him
 by
 name,
 but
 I
 had


never
 read
 anything.
 And
 then
 Train


Dreams
 came
 out
 right
 around
 the
 time
 or


right
 after
 I
 got
 out
 of
 college
 and
 I


was
 like
 I
 was
 buming
 around
 and
 Train


Dreams
 was
 one
 of
 the
 books
 to
 read
 that


year
 and
 it
 was
 a
 very
 like
 good
 size
 to


slip
 in
 a
 backpack


>> and
 uh
 and
 so
 I
 picked
 it
 up
 somewhere


on
 the
 road
 and
 just
 fell
 in
 love
 with


the
 book.


>> What
 was
 it
 in
 that
 book
 that
 that


connected
 you
 to
 it?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 There
 was
 just
 something


about
 the
 the
 story
 of
 this
 little
 life


and
 how


Dennis
 rendered
 it
 in
 such
 a
 way
 that


you
 felt
 you
 felt
 the
 epicness
 and
 you


you
 felt
 the
 vastness
 of
 of
 this
 small


little
 life


>> and
 it
 reminded
 me
 of
 so
 many
 of
 the


people
 that
 I
 had
 grown
 up
 with
 and
 and


been
 raised
 by.
 I
 was
 raised
 in
 a


ranching
 family
 in
 Florida
 and
 very


workingass
 and
 Grineer
 and
 all
 the


people
 in
 this
 book
 just
 reminded
 me
 of


the
 of
 of
 the
 people
 I'd
 been
 raised


around.
 The
 book
 just
 like


kind
 of
 lived
 inside
 me
 and
 I
 I
 would


find
 myself
 over
 the
 years
 like


different
 scenes
 would
 pop
 up
 to
 the


surface
 without
 really
 knowing
 why.


>> At
 that
 point
 in
 your
 life,
 you're
 a


young
 man.
 You
 read
 this
 book
 for
 the


first
 time.
 Were
 you
 a
 writer?


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 I
 was
 I
 was
 making
 short
 films


with
 my
 friends,
 but
 just
 for
 fun
 and


didn't
 think
 of
 myself
 as
 as
 somebody


who
 would
 become
 a
 filmmaker.
 I
 thought


I
 would
 be
 a
 novelist
 and
 and
 tried
 very


hard
 to
 be
 one
 and
 have
 a
 couple
 of
 like


carcasses
 of
 novels
 on
 my
 computer
 that


never
 that
 never
 saw
 the
 light
 of
 day


and
 a
 ton
 of
 um
 rejection
 letters
 from


that
 time
 from
 from
 like
 every
 literary


magazine
 in
 the
 in
 the
 country.


>> What
 were
 you
 writing
 about?
 I
 was


making
 all
 the
 mistakes
 that
 that
 a


young
 writer
 makes
 of
 writing
 about


everything
 from
 incredibly
 like


autobiographical
 things
 from
 my


childhood
 or
 from
 some
 random
 party
 that


happened
 all
 the
 way
 to
 you
 know
 some


sort
 of
 like
 I
 I'm
 embarrassed
 to
 say
 it


but
 like
 you
 know
 historical
 fiction.
 Um


but
 it
 was
 good
 training
 in
 in
 terms
 of


just
 like
 learning
 how
 to
 write.
 Do
 you


recall
 any
 particular
 moment
 from
 the


book
 Train
 Dreams
 on
 that
 first
 reading


that
 really
 stuck
 with
 you
 the
 entire


time?


>> Yeah.
 One
 was
 like


the
 way
 that
 he
 talks
 about
 their
 first


date
 and
 their
 first
 kiss
 where
 Grineer


ends
 up
 proposing
 to
 Glattis.


>> That
 would
 just
 always
 like
 bubble
 up
 in


my
 mind
 for
 some
 reason.
 There
 was
 just


such
 a
 a
 beauty
 to
 it.
 There's
 like
 a


phrase
 that
 he
 used
 in
 there
 of
 like
 the


nodding
 of
 the
 buttercups
 that
 that
 just


was
 so
 heartbreaking.
 And
 then
 there's


another
 one
 that
 like
 always
 stuck
 with


me
 as
 as
 being
 so
 strange
 yet
 very
 very


emotional.
 And
 it
 was
 the
 one
 that
 like


when
 I
 came
 back
 around
 and
 read
 it


again
 thinking
 about
 like
 making
 it
 into


a
 movie,
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 scenes
 I
 was


like
 I
 I
 have
 to
 make
 this
 just
 to
 put


this
 scene
 in
 there.
 And
 it
 was
 also
 my


coowriter
 Greg
 when
 he
 read
 it.
 He
 was


like,
 "Oh,
 you
 need
 to
 do
 this.
 This


reminds
 me
 of
 you."
 It's
 the
 one
 where


the
 kid
 Grineer
 is
 a
 15-year-old
 kid


comes
 across
 this
 man
 dying
 in
 the
 woods


and
 gives
 him
 a
 a
 drink
 of
 water
 from


his
 own
 boot.


>> Those
 are
 the
 scenes
 that
 I
 don't
 know


just
 got
 a
 hold
 of
 me.


>> You
 just
 mentioned
 your
 collaborator


Greg
 Quedar.
 Train
 Dreams
 is
 the
 fourth


film
 that
 you've
 worked
 on.
 You've


co-written
 all
 four
 with
 him.
 You've


directed
 two
 of
 them.
 Um,
 how
 did
 you


get
 the
 opportunity
 to
 make
 this
 one
 in


particular
 having
 read
 it,
 you
 know,
 12


years
 ago,
 13
 years
 ago?


>> Yeah,
 this
 one
 came
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I


didn't
 think
 a
 a
 film
 project
 would
 come


to
 me.
 I
 directed
 a
 film
 called
 Jockey


that
 Greg
 and
 I
 had
 written
 together
 and


Greg
 produced
 and
 that
 went
 to
 Sundance


and
 a
 few
 of
 our
 producers
 on
 the
 film


had
 had
 the
 rights
 to
 Train
 Dreams
 for


several
 years
 and
 had
 been
 trying
 to


find
 a
 filmmaker
 to
 make
 it
 and
 they
 saw


Jockey
 at
 Sundance
 and
 I
 think
 just


really
 saw
 some
 like
 kinship
 of
 spirit


or
 or
 some
 kind
 of
 artistic
 kinship


there
 and
 reached
 out.
 And
 at
 first
 I


was
 just
 so
 excited
 at
 the
 prospect.
 And


then
 going
 back
 and
 reading
 the
 book


again,
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 maybe
 this
 thing


is
 unadaptable."
 And
 I
 was
 very
 uh


nervous
 [laughter]
 about
 it.
 I
 went
 back


and
 forth
 on
 it
 for
 a
 while,
 knowing


that
 I
 loved
 it,
 but
 not
 wanting
 to
 do
 a


bad
 job
 of
 it,
 not
 wanting
 to
 let
 the


book
 down
 or
 Dennis,
 even
 though
 he
 was


passed
 on
 at
 the
 time.
 Mhm.


>> And
 so
 it
 took
 me
 a
 minute
 to
 really


like
 jump
 into
 it
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 friends


talking
 me
 off
 ledges
 along
 the
 way.


>> What
 at
 the
 time
 did
 you
 think
 was


unadaptable?
 Like
 what
 was
 giving
 you


pause?


>> Well,
 it's
 just
 I
 I
 think
 going
 back
 to


the
 construction
 of
 the
 novella
 itself,


it's
 only
 116
 or
 117
 pages
 and
 yet
 it
 is


this
 entire
 life,
 an
 entire
 time
 in
 the


world.
 And
 that
 is
 a
 red
 flag
 for
 a


movie
 because
 if
 when
 you're
 trying
 to


cover
 that
 much
 time,
 a
 movie
 can
 start


to
 feel
 like
 a
 Wikipedia
 entry,
 just
 a


bunch
 of
 like
 and
 then
 this
 happened
 and


that
 happened.
 And
 then
 on
 top
 of
 that,


the
 book
 has
 this
 really
 evocative
 style


to
 it
 where
 it's
 it's
 very
 stream
 of


consciousness
 and
 it
 just
 like
 slips
 all


over
 the
 place,
 you
 know,
 and
 in
 one


sentence
 he's
 a
 child
 and
 then
 the
 next


scene
 he's
 dying
 and
 then
 it
 comes
 back


and
 he's
 seeing
 Elvis
 on
 a
 train
 and
 and


it
 all
 works
 so
 well.
 But
 I
 felt
 if
 if


there
 were
 a
 situation
 where
 we
 needed


to
 pin
 that
 down
 to
 more
 of
 a


traditional
 three-act
 structure
 with
 an


inciting
 incident
 and
 blah
 blah
 blah,


you
 kill
 the
 magic
 of
 the
 book.
 And
 I


really
 didn't
 want
 to
 do
 that.


>> So
 you
 get
 over
 your
 concerns,
 your


trepidation,
 you
 decide
 to
 adapt
 this


book.
 Walk
 me
 through


>> I
 just
 ignore
 them.
 Yeah.


>> Hey,
 I
 do
 it
 all
 the
 time.
 [laughter]


Walk
 me
 through
 how
 you
 start.
 Are
 you


rereading
 and
 rereading?
 Luckily,
 this


is
 a
 fairly
 short
 book.
 Are
 you
 ripping


out
 pages,
 underlining
 scenes?
 Like,
 how


do
 you
 start
 to
 sort
 of


>> break
 this
 story,
 for
 lack
 of
 a
 a
 better


phrase,
 into
 one
 that
 you
 can
 translate


to
 screen?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 found
 pretty
 quickly
 that
 I
 h


I
 did
 have
 like
 a
 sense
 of
 this
 what
 the


structure
 could
 be.
 And
 that
 being


basically
 what
 it
 turned
 into,
 which
 is


like
 the
 first
 half
 of
 the
 film,
 kind
 of


watching
 him
 go
 back
 and
 forth
 between


trying
 to
 reconcile
 being
 away
 for
 work


and
 coming
 back
 home
 and
 and
 trying
 to


spend
 time
 with
 the
 family.
 And
 then
 the


fire
 would
 come
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the


film
 and
 just
 break
 the
 narrative
 in


half.
 And
 then
 the
 last
 part
 of
 the
 film


would
 be
 more
 of
 a
 of
 a
 um
 of
 a
 film
 of


searching
 or
 or
 longing
 and
 trying
 to


find
 his
 way
 back
 to
 um
 to
 something


that
 he
 lost
 and
 and
 wondering
 if
 he


could
 ever
 do
 that.


>> Um
 and
 so
 that
 that
 framework


gave
 us
 enough
 confidence
 to
 go
 into
 it.


And
 then
 yeah,
 Greg
 and
 I
 each
 on
 our


own
 just
 read
 the
 book
 multiple
 times,


underlined,
 you
 know,
 anything
 that
 felt


important.
 We
 we
 always
 start
 with
 like


a
 a
 shared
 document
 that
 we
 write
 in


that
 we're
 just
 throwing
 like
 any
 ideas,


anything
 like
 that.
 There's
 like
 a
 grab


bag
 at
 the
 bottom
 that's
 just
 like


random
 lines
 of
 dialogue
 that
 don't
 have


a
 home
 or
 images
 or
 or
 anything
 like


that.
 simultaneously.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of


research
 that
 we're
 both
 doing


individually
 and
 together.
 Like
 reading


anything
 I
 can
 get
 my
 hands
 on.
 The


image
 of
 the
 the
 boots
 nailed
 to
 the


tree
 actually
 is
 is
 one
 that
 came
 from


just
 reading
 some
 random
 history
 of


logging
 book
 and
 learning
 that
 that
 was


something
 that
 they
 had
 done
 for
 the


guys
 who
 would
 ride
 the
 logs
 down
 the


rivers
 and
 would
 break
 apart
 log
 jams


and
 when
 one
 of
 them
 died,
 wherever
 they


found
 his
 body,
 they
 would
 nail
 his


boots
 to
 a
 tree
 there.


>> It's
 a
 striking
 image.
 very
 very


striking
 and
 and
 became
 something
 a
 bit


larger
 than
 than
 the
 image
 itself,
 which


is
 what
 you
 hope
 for.
 But
 yeah,
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 research
 that
 we're
 doing.
 Um,


and
 then
 we're
 just
 like
 in
 that


document,
 we're
 starting
 with
 just
 like


writing
 a
 sentence
 for
 every
 scene
 and


that
 we
 that
 we
 know
 is
 going
 to
 be
 in


the
 film.
 And
 sometimes
 that's
 as
 simple


as
 just
 like
 Grineer
 comes
 home
 and
 it's


awkward,
 you
 know,
 or
 the
 fire
 happens,


you
 know,
 and
 then
 we
 build
 out
 each
 of


those
 sentences
 into
 a
 paragraph.
 and


each
 paragraph
 is
 about
 a
 scene.
 Then
 we


start
 taking
 passes
 at
 scenes
 and
 then


passing
 those
 scenes
 back
 and
 forth
 to


just
 try
 and
 refine
 them
 along
 the
 way


until
 we
 until
 we
 have
 a
 uh
 what
 we


always
 hope
 is
 a
 better
 first
 draft
 than


it
 is,
 but
 a
 terrible
 first
 draft.
 And


then
 and
 then
 you
 can
 start
 refining
 a


script
 from
 there.


So,
 this
 is
 your
 first
 fiction


adaptation
 and
 and
 as
 someone
 who's
 done


it
 now
 and
 has
 seen,
 I
 presume,
 a
 lot
 of


movies
 based
 on
 books,


>> do
 you
 have,
 for
 lack
 of
 a
 a
 less
 fancy


word,
 like
 a
 philosophy
 when
 it
 comes
 to


adaptation,
 what's
 allowed,
 what's
 not


allowed,
 fidelity
 versus
 lack
 of


fidelity.


>> I
 do,
 and
 it's
 it's
 funny.
 It's
 it
 is


one
 that
 I
 went
 into
 the
 process
 with.


And
 so
 whether
 it
 was
 confirmed
 or
 or


whether
 I
 just
 didn't
 look
 at
 any
 other


evidence,
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 I
 felt
 like


whenever
 a
 book
 is
 adapted
 into
 film,


the
 film
 really
 has
 to
 become
 its
 own


thing
 and
 the
 filmmaker
 slashcreenwriter


has
 to
 allow
 themselves
 to
 be
 free
 of


the
 source
 material


>> in
 terms
 of
 what
 happens
 while
 being


completely
 true
 to
 the
 spirit
 of
 that


book.
 There
 there
 are
 exceptions
 to
 that


like
 No
 Country
 for
 Old
 Men
 is
 an


adaptation
 that
 like
 that
 book
 kind
 of


already
 feels
 like
 a
 movie
 and
 was


written
 as
 a
 screenplay
 or
 stage
 play


before
 that.
 But
 that
 was
 the
 thing
 I
 I


I
 felt
 very
 strongly
 and
 I
 still
 do
 with


this
 one
 that
 like
 we
 had
 to
 be


completely
 true
 to
 the
 spirit
 of
 the


book
 and
 the
 spirit
 of
 the
 character.


and
 you
 you
 can't
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 make


Grineer
 this
 like
 striving
 guy
 who
 wants


to
 like
 create
 a
 a
 railroad
 empire
 or


something
 like
 that,
 then
 you're
 then


you're
 what's
 the
 point
 of
 making
 this


book?
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 you
 have
 to


free
 yourself
 from
 the
 book
 itself
 in


order
 to
 let
 the
 film
 become
 its
 own


piece
 of
 work.


>> So,
 you
 talked
 about
 uh
 a
 couple
 of


scenes
 that
 stuck
 with
 you
 when
 you


first
 read
 it.


>> What
 else
 did
 you
 want
 to
 spir
 it
 aside?


What
 else
 did
 you
 want
 to
 sort
 of


transfer
 over
 in
 terms
 of
 tone,


character
 moments,
 in
 terms
 of
 images?


Because


>> it's
 always
 fascinating
 to
 me
 to
 read
 a


book,
 watch
 a
 movie,
 whatever
 order
 it's


in
 to
 sort
 of
 say,
 "Oh,
 this
 yeah,
 I


remember
 this
 from
 the
 book,
 but
 it


feels
 different
 or
 it
 looks
 different,


but
 it's
 still
 there."
 What
 What
 were


you
 most
 excited
 about
 taking
 from
 one


form
 and
 and
 moving
 over?


I
 the
 the
 biggest
 thing
 was
 more
 a


feeling
 like
 the
 strangeness
 the


inherent
 stranges
 of
 the
 world
 that
 I


think


>> we


living
 in
 like
 modern
 society
 in
 this


city
 or
 in
 the
 suburbs
 or
 wherever
 life


feels
 very
 safe
 and
 feels
 very


predictable
 and
 you
 get
 outside
 of
 that


and
 and
 you're
 reminded
 very
 quickly


that
 it
 is
 not
 the
 case.
 That
 was
 one


thing
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 across
 is
 like
 how


strange
 and
 wonderful
 and
 kind
 of


magical


the
 world
 itself
 is
 without
 embellishing


anything.
 And
 that's
 not
 always
 in
 like


a
 sweet
 cute
 way.
 Sometimes
 that's
 in
 a


a
 very
 dangerous
 and
 and
 dark
 way.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 then
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 like


this
 aspect
 of
 time
 and
 just
 the
 way


that
 you
 can
 have
 a
 year
 that
 just
 drags


by
 and
 you're
 like
 this
 is
 never
 going


to
 end.
 And
 then
 sometimes
 you
 look
 up


and
 and
 you're
 like,
 where
 did
 the
 last


5
 years
 go?


>> M


>> uh
 we
 very
 rarely
 have
 an
 understanding


of
 our
 lives
 in
 the
 moment
 we're


actually
 living
 them.
 We
 only
 start
 to


understand
 them
 when
 it's
 too
 late.
 And


yeah,
 so
 there
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 that.


And
 I
 felt
 like
 there
 was
 something
 very


special
 about
 Robert
 Grerier
 in
 terms
 of


taking
 this
 person
 who's
 just
 an
 average


everyday
 person
 who
 is
 just
 trying
 to


lead
 a
 decent
 life
 and
 trying
 to
 make


some
 money
 for
 his
 family
 and
 and
 build


a
 little
 life
 for
 himself
 and
 his
 family


that
 I
 feel
 like
 is
 very
 special
 and
 is


very
 like
 [music]
 epic
 without
 needing


to
 be
 turned
 into
 something
 that
 it's


not.
 You
 know,


>> after
 the
 break,
 Clint
 talks
 about
 a
 few


characters
 that
 he
 added
 to
 the
 film
 and


the
 scenes
 from
 the
 book
 that
 he
 had
 to


cut.


[music]


Some
 people
 think
 you
 you
 sort
 of


referenced
 this
 before,
 but
 like
 a
 short


story,
 a
 novella
 maybe


>> is
 more
 optimal
 for
 adaptation
 because


right
 you
 just
 have
 less
 to
 adapt.
 But


of
 course
 here
 you're
 telling
 the
 story


of
 a
 person.
 Um
 so
 often
 it's
 about
 what


are
 we
 cutting
 out
 of
 the
 story
 in
 order


to
 fit
 into
 a
 film.


>> But
 you
 added
 a
 couple
 characters
 or
 a


couple
 moments,
 a
 couple
 scenes
 into


this.
 You
 added
 Apostle
 Frank,


>> the
 very
 talkative
 uh
 logger
 played
 by


Paul
 Schneider.
 You
 added
 the
 the
 Forest


Service
 employee
 played
 by
 Carrie


Condan.
 Paying
 respects
 still
 to
 the


Nolla
 and
 Dennis
 Johnson.
 How
 do
 you


make
 the
 decision
 to
 layer
 your
 own


storytelling
 on
 top
 of
 that?
 I'm
 putting


new
 characters
 and
 then
 what
 were
 you


trying
 to
 say
 through
 those
 characters?


Yeah,
 I
 with
 with
 Apostle
 Frank,
 I
 felt


like
 he
 there
 were
 several
 sections
 of


the
 book
 that
 we
 needed
 to
 build
 out


that
 Dennis
 had
 written
 something
 about


some
 section
 of
 time
 but
 then
 does
 only


writes
 three
 sentences
 about
 it,
 you


know,
 and
 with
 Apostle
 Frank
 in


particular
 just
 about
 building
 out
 the


characters
 of
 that
 world
 to
 show
 us
 why


Grineer
 is
 so
 connected
 to
 these
 people


and
 and
 to
 this
 to
 this
 world
 that
 he's


living
 And
 and
 I've
 worked
 on
 a
 lot
 of


crews


like
 in
 construction
 and
 on
 farms
 where


there's
 always
 somebody
 who
 talks
 more


than
 he
 works
 and
 you're
 just
 like


[laughter]
 please
 just
 shut
 up
 man.


>> Well,
 you
 have
 him
 and
 you
 have
 the
 the


character
 played
 by
 William
 H.
 Spacy.


He's
 Arn
 who
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 older
 so


maybe
 it's
 a
 more
 understandable
 that


he's
 not
 working
 as
 much
 but
 he's
 just


he's
 just
 blabbing
 blabbing
 blabbing


[laughter]
 that
 he
 does
 his
 one
 job


blowing
 stuff
 up.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.
 He
 had
 a
 he
 had
 a


particular
 set
 of
 skills.
 That
 character


is
 larger
 than
 life
 on
 the
 page
 armed


peoples
 and
 I'd
 say
 like
 half
 of
 the


stuff
 that
 he
 says
 in
 the
 film
 is
 just


from
 the
 book
 just
 lifted
 directly
 from


the
 book
 and
 then
 we
 were
 really
 just


trying
 to
 expand
 on
 that
 to
 fill
 out


that
 character
 without
 ever


>> pushing
 him
 in
 a
 direction
 that
 that's


felt
 un
 unnatural
 to
 him.
 Um,
 and
 then


Carrie
 Conan's
 character,
 that
 was
 one


that
 like
 it
 took
 us
 a
 while
 to
 get


there.
 Claire
 Thompson
 is
 a
 character
 in


the
 novella,
 but
 she's
 a
 widow
 that
 he's


transporting,
 and
 there's
 not
 much


that's
 said
 between
 them,
 but
 it's
 a


really
 important
 moment
 in
 Grineer's


life
 that
 culminates
 in
 her
 telling
 him


in
 the
 book
 that
 the
 the
 Lord
 needs
 a


hermit
 in
 the
 woods
 as
 much
 as
 a


preacher
 in
 the
 pulpit.
 that
 gives
 him


some
 measure
 of
 like
 understanding
 of


his
 life
 a
 bit
 even
 though
 he
 has
 the


question
 back
 of
 like
 is
 that
 what
 I
 am


a
 hermit?
 Um
 even
 though
 we've
 watched


him
 for
 like
 70
 pages
 be
 a
 hermit.


>> Well,
 you
 don't
 always
 understand


yourself.
 One
 doesn't
 always
 understand


their
 own
 life.


>> 100%.
 Um


>> and
 so
 there
 was
 like
 there
 was
 this


amalgamation
 of
 things
 we
 were
 trying
 to


do
 and
 fit
 in.
 One
 was
 like
 keep
 that


character
 intact
 but
 expand
 her
 a
 bit.


And
 then
 the
 other
 part
 that
 is
 a
 bit


thematic
 and
 a
 bit
 historical,
 which
 is


just
 like
 we
 really
 wanted
 to
 show
 these


fire
 towers
 that
 had
 popped
 up
 across


the
 Pacific
 Northwest.
 There
 were
 a
 ton


of
 really
 terrible
 fires
 and
 some
 around


like
 1921
 and
 some
 like
 10
 years
 earlier


that
 had
 gone
 through
 and
 just
 decimated


the
 area.
 And
 so
 then
 we
 have
 the
 forest


service
 that
 gets
 created
 and
 all
 these


fire
 watchtowers
 get
 put
 all
 over
 the


area
 up
 there
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 were


operated
 and
 run
 by
 women.


>> And
 so
 that
 was
 just
 something


texturally
 that
 we
 wanted
 to
 put
 in
 that


also
 spoke
 thematically
 to
 the
 fact
 that


if
 these
 fire
 towers
 had
 been
 put
 up,


you
 know,
 a
 decade
 earlier,
 his
 family


might
 still
 be
 alive.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 and
 then
 that
 character


became
 a
 vehicle
 to
 talk
 about
 a
 lot
 of


like
 some
 thematic
 things
 that
 I
 felt


that
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 in
 terms
 of


you
 know
 kind
 of
 the
 like
 the
 tragedy
 of


life
 moving
 on
 without
 you
 and
 ecology


and
 our
 place
 in
 the
 world
 and
 our
 place


in
 time
 and
 all
 of
 that
 ultimately


building
 up
 to
 that
 line
 that's
 so


powerful
 in
 the
 book
 itself
 of
 the
 world


needing
 a
 a
 hermit
 in
 the
 woods
 as
 much


as
 the
 preacher
 in
 pulpit.


>> I
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 another
 line


that
 occurs
 when
 he's
 talking
 to
 the
 the


Carrie
 Conan
 character.
 She
 says,
 "Were


you
 here
 for
 the
 fire?"
 He
 says,
 "I


wasn't.
 My
 wife
 and
 child
 were.
 They


didn't
 make
 it."
 And
 then
 he
 describes


possibly
 for
 the
 first
 time,
 at
 least
 in


the
 film.


>> It's
 a
 brief
 glimmer,
 but
 he
 describes


what
 he's
 feeling.
 as
 a
 viewer,
 you
 have


to
 largely
 up
 until
 that
 point
 just


discern
 what
 he
 is
 feeling
 without


relying
 on
 the
 character's
 dialogue.
 But


he
 says,
 "Sometimes
 it
 feels
 like
 the


sadness
 will
 eat
 me
 alive
 and
 sometimes


it
 feels
 like
 it
 happened
 to
 someone


else."
 Um,
 I
 am
 lucky
 enough
 where
 I


have
 not
 had
 to
 experience
 that
 sort
 of


grief.


>> I
 know
 it's
 coming.
 You
 know,
 my
 parents


are
 still
 around
 and
 all
 that
 stuff.
 But


how
 do
 you
 I
 was
 just
 re-watching
 again


that
 scene
 this
 morning
 and
 I
 almost


started
 I
 almost
 started
 crying.
 It


really
 is
 affecting.
 How
 do
 you
 transfer


emotion
 from
 a
 page
 to
 the
 screen?


Because
 I
 think
 you
 probably
 watched


that
 scene
 20
 times
 and
 still
 feel
 that


emotion.


>> I
 mean
 that
 came
 from
 a
 very
 real
 place


that
 line.
 I
 unfortunately
 have
 dealt


with
 that
 loss
 that
 you're
 speaking
 of


and
 and
 lost
 both
 my
 folks
 in
 in
 a
 very


quick
 succession
 and
 and
 there
 was
 some


tragedy
 to
 to
 it
 as
 time
 went
 on
 that


you
 you
 do
 move
 on
 from
 something
 you


don't
 feel
 like
 you
 can
 and
 and


sometimes
 it
 feels
 very
 distant
 and


sometimes
 you
 wake
 up
 and
 it
 feels
 like


they
 just
 passed
 on
 yesterday.
 Mhm.


>> I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 cheat
 code


with
 being
 a
 filmmaker
 that
 if
 you
 get
 a


great
 actor,
 [laughter]


they
 can
 they
 do
 the
 heavy
 lifting
 for


you
 in
 terms
 of
 imbuing


something
 like
 that
 that
 could
 be
 a
 bit


flat.
 You
 know,
 that
 that
 that
 line


could
 go
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 and
 it


could
 be
 a
 bit
 straightforward,
 but
 I


think
 that
 in
 particular
 is
 just
 the


magic
 of
 what
 Joel
 does
 as
 an
 actor
 is


just
 a
 testament
 to
 his
 subtlety
 and


nuance
 as
 an
 actor.


Is
 that
 a
 scene?
 Is
 that
 a
 moment
 that


you
 to
 your
 recollection
 you
 had
 to
 do
 a


couple
 times?
 I
 know
 you're
 filming
 it


outside,
 so
 you're
 trying
 to
 make
 sure


you
 do
 it
 while
 the
 while
 the
 light
 is


good.
 But
 what
 was
 your
 recollection
 of


filming
 that
 that
 moment?


>> That
 was
 a
 really
 beautiful
 scene,
 I


think.
 But
 that
 scene
 we
 started
 filming


and
 we
 did
 a
 couple
 takes
 and
 and
 the


sun
 was
 too
 high
 and
 it
 was
 just
 too


harsh
 on
 them
 and
 they
 were
 both
 kind
 of


squinting
 at
 each
 other.
 And
 so
 we
 all,


Adulo,
 my
 cinematographer
 and
 I,
 and
 and


Joel
 and
 Carrie,
 we
 all
 kind
 of
 decided


like,
 let's
 take
 a
 break.
 Like,
 let's


give
 it
 an
 hour,
 let
 the
 sun
 get
 softer.


And
 so
 we
 just
 stepped
 away
 and
 like


took
 a
 moment,
 had
 some
 tea,
 and
 then


when
 we
 got
 back
 into
 it,
 it
 all
 that


scene
 came
 together
 very
 quickly.
 And


that
 scene
 is
 kind
 of
 how
 our
 editor,


Parker
 Larie,
 first
 cut
 it
 together
 on


the
 assembly
 cut.
 It's
 largely
 intact.


Yeah.


And
 do
 you
 feel
 as
 a
 a
 director,
 is
 it


part
 of
 your
 job
 to
 be


to
 be
 vulnerable
 with
 your
 actors
 as


well?
 Like
 are
 you
 when
 you're
 talking


to
 Joel,
 are
 you
 referencing
 your
 own


experiences
 with
 grief
 and
 stuff
 like


that?
 Are
 you
 sort
 of
 trying
 to
 convey


what's
 inside
 of
 you
 as
 a
 director
 and


the
 writer
 to
 him
 through
 that
 personal


connection?
 Like
 you're
 taking
 him
 off


to
 the
 side
 and
 telling
 him
 stuff.
 as


much
 as
 it's
 helpful,
 you
 know,
 we
 do
 we


specifically
 with
 Joel
 and
 I,
 we
 did
 a


lot
 of
 that
 before
 we
 ever
 got
 on
 set.


And
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 prep
 would
 just
 be
 like


these
 long
 phone
 conversations
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 night.
 Um,
 talking
 about


being
 a
 parent
 and
 losing
 family
 and
 and


all
 the
 everything
 in
 between,
 you
 know.


I
 think
 like
 it's
 such
 a
 strange
 thing


where
 you
 have
 to
 as
 a
 director
 I
 I
 I


want
 to
 be
 as
 open
 with
 them
 as
 possible


at
 all
 times
 without
 making
 it
 about
 me.


You
 know what
 I
 mean?
 So
 it's
 so
 it's


about
 so
 that
 they
 can
 ground
 themselves


in
 their
 character
 and
 what
 that


character
 is
 going
 through
 emotionally


versus
 thinking
 about
 like
 what
 was


Clint
 thinking
 at
 the
 like
 when
 he
 when


he
 uh
 buried
 his
 mother.
 And
 so
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 that
 that
 just
 like
 it's
 kind


of
 the
 tragedy
 of
 it
 where
 as
 a
 director


I've
 found
 like
 I'm
 not
 as
 emotionally


wrapped
 up
 in
 the
 scenes
 as
 they're


unfolding
 and
 being
 as
 emotionally


affected
 by
 them
 because
 I'm
 having
 to


pay
 attention
 to
 so
 many
 technical


elements
 in
 order
 to
 give
 everybody


notes
 between
 takes
 so
 that
 we're


actually
 using
 our
 time.


>> That's
 incredible
 that
 sort
 of
 you
 have


to
 sort
 of
 bifurcate
 yourself
 in
 a
 way.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 you
 rap
 and
 everybody


starts
 breaking
 down
 the
 cameras
 and


then
 and
 then
 you
 cry
 in
 a
 corner.
 Uh


because
 it
 all
 hits
 you
 all
 of
 a
 sudden.


[laughter]


>> I
 uh


I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 Will
 Patton.


>> Oh
 yeah.


>> The
 audio
 book
 for
 Train
 Dreams
 came


out,
 you
 know,
 15
 or
 so
 years
 ago.
 Will


Patton
 narrated
 that.
 He
 is
 the
 narrator


of
 your
 film.
 I'm
 sure
 you
 know


narration
 can
 be
 pretty
 dicey
 in
 films.


You
 can
 go.


>> You
 can
 have
 Morgan
 Freeman
 in
 the
 Shaw


Shank
 Redemption.
 You
 can
 have
 Harrison


Ford
 in
 Bladeunner
 where
 they're
 like,


"This
 is
 so
 bad.
 We're
 actually
 going
 to


make
 a
 new
 cut
 of
 this
 movie
 in
 which


there's
 no
 narration."
 What
 would
 you


say
 are
 the
 pitfalls
 when
 it
 comes
 to


film
 narration?
 And
 how
 did
 you
 make


sure
 to
 try
 to
 avoid
 that?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 you
 never
 want
 to
 do
 the


thing
 where
 like
 somebody
 walks
 through


a
 door
 and
 then
 the
 narrator
 says,
 "And


then
 he
 walked
 through
 a
 door."
 Uh,


that's
 what
 you
 want
 to
 avoid.
 And
 it's


funny.
 Bladeunner
 uh,
 from
 what
 I've


read,
 Harrison
 Ford
 did
 not
 want
 to
 do


that.


>> Well,
 I
 see
 why.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Like,
 and
 so
 that's
 part
 of


his
 performance
 is
 just
 like,
 I
 got
 to


get
 through
 this.
 But
 I
 love
 the
 idea
 of


a
 narrator
 like
 a
 narrator
 as
 a


storyteller
 and
 and
 in
 this
 particular


sense
 a
 narrator
 like
 if
 you
 had
 found


yourself
 in
 some
 like
 little
 bar
 in
 a


logging
 town
 and
 you
 were
 there
 late
 at


night
 and
 this
 guy
 comes
 up
 to
 you
 who's


had
 too
 many
 beers
 and
 is
 like
 hey
 let


me
 tell
 you
 about
 this
 guy
 Robert
 Geneer


and
 and
 somebody
 really
 like
 tells
 you
 a


story


>> and
 I
 always
 love
 the
 narrators
 from


like
 Jules
 and
 Jim
 and
 E2
 Mama
 Tambien


who
 who
 kind
 of
 take
 take
 aides
 and
 tell


you
 things
 that
 don't
 have
 anything
 to


do
 with
 the
 plot
 but
 have
 everything
 to


do
 with
 the
 story.
 And
 then
 the
 other


side
 of
 it
 was
 just
 like
 one
 of
 the


intrical
 pieces
 of
 why
 that
 book
 works


so
 well
 is
 Dennis
 Johnson's
 voice,
 his


his
 narrative
 voice.
 And
 so
 I
 really


felt
 strongly
 that
 that
 was
 something


that
 we
 had
 to
 pull
 into
 the
 to
 the


movie
 itself.


>> Your
 movie
 has
 been
 very
 well
 received.


The
 only
 criticisms
 I've
 seen
 have
 to
 do


with
 a
 change
 in
 tone,
 which
 is
 like


smoothing
 a
 couple
 things
 out,
 making


Grineer
 a
 little
 less,
 slightly
 less


unlikable.


>> There's
 the
 character
 that
 you
 talk


about
 first
 time
 you
 read,
 the
 guy


played
 by
 Clifton
 Collins
 in
 the
 film,


in
 the
 book,
 not
 a
 nice
 guy,
 as
 you
 come


to
 learn,
 you
 know,
 he's
 sort
 of


sexually
 abused
 uh
 a
 family
 member.
 Do


you
 see
 that
 those
 things
 are
 something


that
 you
 changed
 on
 purpose
 because
 you


wanted
 to
 achieve
 a
 kind
 of
 different


feel
 in
 your
 movie?
 Those
 those
 the
 idea


that
 Robert
 Grineer
 is
 someone
 who
 maybe


was
 a
 little
 too
 enthusiastic
 about


throwing
 his
 Chinese
 colleague
 off
 a


rail
 bridge
 and
 the
 idea
 that
 the


Clifton
 Collins
 character
 is
 someone
 who


is
 not
 just
 suffering
 in
 the
 woods
 but


also
 is
 a
 bad
 person.


>> Oh
 yeah.


>> What
 what
 were
 you
 like
 I
 don't
 think
 I


need
 this.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 it's
 funny


with
 Clifton's
 character,
 there's
 a


whole
 10
 minute
 or
 eight
 minute
 version


of
 that
 scene


>> really.


>> We
 filmed
 the
 whole
 thing
 and
 it
 just


like


>> it's
 like
 90
 seconds.


>> It's
 very
 it's
 if
 that
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It's


very
 short,
 which
 I
 felt
 terrible
 about


because
 again,
 there's
 something
 about


that
 that
 scene.
 And
 what
 I
 think
 Dennis


did
 in
 his
 writing
 in
 general
 was
 to
 try


and
 look
 at
 some
 people
 who
 had
 done


incredibly
 depraved
 things


>> and
 things
 that
 are
 in
 no
 world
 okay


>> and
 try
 and
 find
 some
 little
 glimmer
 of


humanity
 in
 them
 and
 try
 and
 find
 what's


what's
 human
 about
 them
 so
 that
 we
 all


maybe
 look
 at
 each
 other
 that
 way.


Right.
 I
 that
 that's
 my
 take
 as
 as
 a


reader
 of
 his
 of
 his
 work.
 And
 I
 think


that
 scene
 with
 Clifton
 is
 an
 example
 of


that
 from
 my
 perspective.
 But
 the
 thing


is
 like
 it
 just
 didn't
 work
 in
 the


movie.
 Like
 nowhere
 we
 put
 it
 even
 just


structurally
 like
 there
 was
 nowhere
 we


put
 it
 where
 it
 where
 it
 worked
 without


feeling
 like
 it
 was
 suddenly
 coming
 from


a
 different
 movie.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 yet
 it
 was
 an
 image
 and
 and


something
 that
 was
 like
 so
 potent
 that
 I


felt
 like
 we
 couldn't
 lose
 it.
 And
 so


just
 what
 remains
 is
 him
 giving
 this
 guy


a
 drink
 of
 water
 from
 his
 boot.
 And
 then


you
 know
 the
 narration
 says
 that
 he


didn't
 like
 to
 think
 about
 that
 moment


from
 his
 life
 to
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 going


to
 mean
 anything
 to
 anybody
 who
 hasn't


read
 the
 book
 but
 hopefully
 to
 pay


homage
 to


>> to
 that.


>> The
 other
 thing
 with
 like
 I
 mean
 Grineer


in
 the
 movie
 does
 help
 he
 helps
 for
 a


moment.
 He
 gets
 swept
 up
 in
 this


violence
 of
 helping
 carry
 this
 guy
 up


towards
 the
 bridge.


>> Yeah.
 Grab
 grabs
 his
 legs.


>> Grabs
 his
 legs
 to
 help
 take
 him
 up.
 Gets


kicked
 off.
 that
 scene
 is
 not
 as
 built


out
 as
 it
 is
 in
 the
 book.
 Partly
 just


because
 of
 again
 a
 different
 medium
 and


I've
 read
 the
 criticism.
 I
 don't
 really


have
 any
 any
 response
 to
 it
 other
 than


like
 there's
 things
 I
 think
 that
 like


again
 I
 might
 my
 my
 viewpoints
 on
 this


might
 evolve
 as
 I
 evolve
 as
 an
 artist.


Mhm.


>> But
 I
 think
 there
 are
 things
 that
 can


work
 and
 that
 you
 can
 do
 in
 literature.


There
 there's
 a
 bit
 of
 sometimes
 a
 a


distance
 you
 can
 have
 from
 something


very
 tough
 that
 you
 can't
 have
 that


emotional
 distance
 from
 it
 in
 film
 in


the
 same
 way
 in
 in
 cinema.
 The
 fire
 is
 a


good
 example
 of
 that.
 The
 fire
 and
 and


the
 vision
 of
 Glattis


>> and
 and
 how
 she
 dies
 and
 and
 the
 kid


like
 how
 they
 get
 swept
 up
 in
 the
 fire.


That's
 a
 very
 in
 early
 edits
 that
 was
 a


much
 longer
 sequence
 but
 it
 was
 a
 cal
 it


had
 to
 be
 a
 calibration
 of
 like
 okay
 how


much
 how
 much
 are
 we
 putting
 people


through
 and
 what
 are
 we
 giving
 them
 in


return.


>> Yeah
 I
 mean
 that
 part
 is
 pretty
 sad


without
 those
 images
 already.
 [laughter]


Uh
 I
 have
 one
 more
 question.
 You
 have


called
 the
 ending
 of
 Dennis
 Johnson's


novela
 one
 of
 the
 great
 endings
 in


literature.


>> It's
 not
 hyperbole.
 I
 I
 do
 mean
 that.
 I


I
 sort
 of
 want
 to
 read
 the
 ending
 and


then
 ask
 you
 why
 you
 think
 it's
 great,


but
 it's
 quite
 long.


>> Do
 you
 disagree
 that
 it's
 that
 it's


great?


>> I
 listened
 to
 the
 audiobook
 version
 and


it
 was
 coming
 to
 the
 end.
 It's
 Will


Patton
 and
 it
 my
 heart
 stopped
 when
 when


the
 book
 stopped.
 I
 I
 thought
 it
 was


incredible.
 You
 know what?
 I
 am
 going
 to


read
 it.


>> You
 should
 read
 it
 and
 then
 you
 can
 cut


it
 out
 if
 you
 want.
 I'll
 listen
 to
 it


>> and
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 tell
 me
 why
 you


why
 it's
 so
 great.
 So
 bear
 with
 me.


This
 is
 the
 ending
 of
 Dennis
 Johnson's


Train
 Dreams.
 The
 main
 character,
 Robert


Craneer,
 is
 in
 a
 theater
 watching
 a


performance
 on
 stage
 by
 by
 someone
 that


is
 referred
 to
 as
 a
 a
 wolf
 boy.


But
 they
 hushed
 all
 at
 once
 and
 quite


abruptly
 when
 he
 stood
 still
 at
 center


stage,
 his
 arms
 straight
 out
 from
 his


shoulders
 and
 went
 rigid
 and
 began
 to


tremble
 with
 a
 massive
 inner
 dynamism.


Nobody
 present
 had
 ever
 seen
 anyone


stand
 so
 still
 and
 yet
 so
 strangely


mobile.
 He
 laid
 his
 head
 back
 until
 his


scalp
 contacted
 his
 spine
 that
 far
 back


and
 open
 his
 throat
 and
 a
 sound
 rose
 in


the
 auditorium
 like
 a
 wind
 coming
 from


all
 four
 directions
 low
 and
 terrifying


rumbling
 up
 from
 the
 ground
 beneath
 the


floor.
 And
 it
 gathered
 into
 a
 roar
 that


sucked
 at
 the
 hearing
 itself
 and


coalesed
 into
 a
 voice
 that
 penetrated


into
 the
 sinuses
 and
 finally
 into
 the


very
 minds
 of
 those
 hearing
 it.
 taking


itself
 higher
 and
 higher,
 more
 and
 more


awful
 and
 beautiful.
 The
 originating


ideal
 of
 all
 such
 sounds
 ever
 made,
 of


the
 fog
 horn
 and
 the
 ship's
 horn,
 the


locomotives
 lonesome
 whistle,
 of
 opera


singing
 and
 the
 music
 of
 flutes
 and
 the


continuous
 moan
 music
 of
 bag
 pipes.
 And


suddenly
 it
 all
 went
 black
 and
 that
 time


was
 gone
 forever.


He
 was
 pretty
 good.


He
 was
 okay.
 He
 knew
 what
 he
 was
 doing.


>> Why
 is
 that
 so
 great?


>> I
 mean,
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 like
 I
 I
 came
 to


that
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 that's
 the
 end
 of


the
 movie.
 That's
 perfect.
 That's
 going


to
 be
 fantastic
 to
 what
 what
 an
 ending.


And
 then
 we
 shot
 that
 and
 then
 two


things
 happened.
 One,
 you
 realize
 very


quickly,
 at least
 for
 where
 for
 my


abilities
 now
 as
 a
 filmmaker,
 I
 could


not
 translate
 the
 magic
 of
 that.
 How
 do


you
 do
 the
 originating
 ideal
 of
 all
 such


sounds
 ever
 made?
 Right?
 [laughter]


What
 does
 that
 sound
 like?


And
 we
 tried
 some
 versions
 in
 sound


design
 to
 make
 something
 like
 that
 and


couldn't
 do
 it.
 And
 then
 simultaneously


like
 we
 had
 a
 very
 early
 version
 of
 the


plane
 sequence.
 It's
 in
 the
 book
 as
 well


and
 that
 was
 going
 to
 lead
 up
 to
 this


ending.
 And
 we
 were
 watching
 the
 film


down
 and
 it
 was
 just
 so
 clear
 that
 after


that
 plane
 sequence,
 the
 film
 was
 over.


Like
 that's
 it.
 And
 and
 then
 the
 rest
 of


it
 just
 kind
 of
 trailing
 off.
 And
 as
 an


artist
 or
 a
 filmmaker,
 you
 either
 listen


to
 that
 or
 you
 don't
 at
 your
 own
 peril.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 I
 listen
 to
 it
 and
 we
 started


restructuring
 the
 ending
 around


the
 the
 biplane
 sequence
 and
 and
 letting


that
 be
 the
 the
 the
 natural
 ending
 of


the
 film.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 a
 very
 moving


ending.
 You
 have
 this
 movie
 that
 is
 so


earthbound
 for
 so
 long
 and
 then
 in
 its


final
 moments
 almost
 as
 if
 he's


ascending
 to
 heaven,
 the
 final
 moments


of
 his
 life.
 It's
 you
 go
 up
 into
 the
 air


and
 then
 and
 then
 it's
 over.
 It
 was


great.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Coming
 up,
 Clint
 has
 a
 few


recommendations
 about
 what
 you
 should


read
 next.


>> [music]


>> So
 Clint,
 for
 more
 than
 a
 decade,
 every


week,
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 Book
 Review
 has


asked
 authors
 a
 recurring
 set
 of


questions
 about
 their
 reading
 and
 their


reading
 lives.
 It's
 uh
 it's
 part
 of
 a


series
 that
 we
 call
 Buy
 the
 Book.
 So,


Clint
 Bentley,
 I
 have
 some
 extremely


specific
 book
 questions
 for
 you.
 First,


what
 is
 your
 favorite
 book
 that
 no
 one


else
 has
 heard
 of?


>> There
 was
 there's
 one
 that
 I
 uh
 have


recommended
 to
 so
 many
 people
 and
 and
 I


just
 found
 I
 I
 just
 recommended
 to


someone
 like
 three
 days
 ago
 and
 it
 it


was
 one
 that
 no
 one
 had
 ever
 heard
 of,


but
 I
 found
 somebody
 who's
 read
 it.
 It's


called
 The
 Collected
 Works
 of
 Billy
 the


Kid.
 It's
 by
 Michael
 and
 Donce.
 Mhm.


>> It's
 it's
 so
 much
 more
 than
 what
 it


sounds
 like.
 It's
 this
 very
 strange
 book


that
 is
 a
 collection
 of
 short
 stories,


photographs,
 poetry.


It's
 just
 like
 it's
 hard
 to
 categorize


what
 exactly
 it
 is.
 It's
 a
 very
 magical


book
 where
 you
 like
 you
 don't
 know
 what


you're
 going
 to
 encounter
 as
 you
 flip


each
 page.


>> I've
 never
 heard
 of
 this.


>> It's
 fantastic.
 He's
 got
 another
 one


that
 he
 did
 a
 similar
 thing
 with
 that
 I'


I've
 got
 like
 coming
 from
 the
 library
 so


I
 can
 so
 I
 can
 read
 it.
 But


>> I
 I
 love
 that
 you're
 a
 library
 guy


>> always.


>> Are
 there
 any
 classic
 novels
 that
 you


only
 just
 recently
 read
 for
 the
 first


time?


>> Well,
 yeah.
 Uh
 yeah,
 that
 is
 an
 ongoing


uh
 [laughter]
 thing.
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 I'm


forever
 catching
 up.
 One
 that
 I've
 got


here
 that
 I
 just
 picked
 up
 that
 I
 I


sadly
 have
 never
 read
 To
 the
 Lighthouse.


>> Oh
 wow.
 I've
 I've
 read
 like
 uh
 you
 know


I've
 read
 Virginia
 Wolf's
 Pros,
 but
 I've


never
 read
 a
 full
 book
 by
 her
 and
 so
 um


and
 so
 I
 just
 picked
 out


>> You
 have
 a
 copy
 there?


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Which
 genres
 do
 you
 especially
 enjoy


reading?
 And
 are
 there
 any
 that
 you


avoid?
 Just
 are
 not
 to
 your
 liking?


>> There
 are
 no
 genres
 that
 I
 avoid.
 There


are
 ones
 that
 I
 read
 less
 like
 I
 don't


read
 that
 much
 sci-fi,
 but
 not
 out
 of


not
 liking
 it,
 just
 just
 out
 of
 like
 I


don't
 know
 that
 I'm
 as
 drawn
 to
 it.
 But


the
 books
 that
 I
 love
 the
 most
 and
 the


things
 that
 I'm
 drawn
 to
 the
 most
 are


books
 that
 like
 aren't
 of
 a
 specific


genre
 and
 break
 and
 and
 break
 apart
 the


conventions
 of
 whatever
 genre
 they're


working
 in
 like
 that
 on
 Danton
 book
 or


I've
 just
 gotten
 into
 John
 Burgger


recently


>> uh
 and
 and
 started
 reading
 some
 of
 his


no
 some
 of
 his
 fiction
 which
 is
 lovely.


Um


>> is
 there
 a
 specific
 title
 that
 you
 would


recommend?


>> I
 would
 and
 it's
 a
 bit
 out
 of
 order.
 He


did
 this
 trilogy
 um
 that
 I
 just
 like


stumbled
 upon.
 The
 second
 one
 is
 the
 one


that
 I
 started
 with
 and
 that
 I
 read


called
 Once
 in
 Europa,
 but
 it's
 a


collection
 of
 it's
 like
 a
 short
 story


cycle.
 And
 I
 think
 for
 fans
 of
 Train


Dreams
 might
 be
 fans
 of
 that
 as
 well


because
 there's
 very
 similar
 themes


about
 life
 kind
 of
 moving
 on
 and
 leaving


people
 behind
 and
 some
 wonderful
 things


coming
 from
 from
 modernization
 and
 and


some
 really
 tragic
 things
 coming
 from


it.


>> You're
 a
 filmmaker
 who
 obviously
 loves


books
 and
 loves
 reading.
 Um,
 is
 there
 a


book
 about
 film
 making
 that
 you
 would


recommend
 that
 people
 read?


>> Oh,
 yes.
 I'll
 give
 you
 a
 couple


depending
 on
 your
 flavor.
 I
 find
 there


there's
 there's
 been
 a
 few
 that
 have


been
 written
 by
 or
 about
 filmmakers
 that


are
 really
 I
 think
 special.
 Tarovski
 has


one,
 Andre
 Tarovski
 has
 one
 called


Sculpting
 in
 Time
 that
 is
 a
 really


phenomenal
 book
 and
 he
 he
 was
 at
 the
 end


of
 his
 life
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 his
 life


when
 he
 wrote
 it
 and
 it's
 very
 much
 like


not
 only
 him
 reflecting
 on
 his
 life
 but


him
 reflecting
 on
 the
 form
 and
 so
 it's


got
 both
 him
 speaking
 biographically


about
 how
 he
 became
 who
 he
 is
 as
 an


artist
 while
 also
 talking
 about
 what
 he


feels
 like
 is
 special
 about
 the
 form
 and


and
 unique
 about
 the
 form.
 There's


another
 one
 about
 David
 Lean.
 It's
 just


called
 David
 Lean,
 a
 biography.
 And
 it


just
 it's
 like
 that
 thick,
 but
 it
 goes


film
 by
 film.


>> Of
 course,
 a
 biography
 of
 David
 Lean
 is


going
 to
 be
 epic.


>> And
 it's
 really
 got
 to
 be
 it's
 really


good
 and
 I
 think
 really
 like
 gives
 a


glimpse
 not
 only
 of
 that
 artist,
 but


also
 of
 like
 film
 developing
 over
 the


like
 like
 film
 as
 a
 medium
 developing


over
 the
 20th
 century.
 And
 last
 one
 I'll


say
 is
 not
 film
 related,
 but
 I
 love
 it


and
 I
 recommend
 it
 to
 everybody.
 It's


called
 Cold
 Train
 on
 Cold
 Train
 and
 it's


a
 collection
 of
 interviews
 with
 with


John


>> Col
 Train


>> that
 I
 I
 have
 learned
 so
 much
 as
 an


artist
 and
 and
 and
 about
 life.
 Like
 it's


such
 a
 it's
 such
 a
 special
 book.


>> I
 think
 that's
 it.
 I
 I
 think
 I
 ran
 out


of
 questions.
 [laughter]


>> I
 feel
 like
 we
 could
 talk
 for
 another


hour.


>> So
 do
 I.
 Clint,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


joining
 the
 Book
 Review
 Podcast.
 This


has
 been
 a
 real
 delight.


>> It's
 been
 a
 joy.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having


me.
