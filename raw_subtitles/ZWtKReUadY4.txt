Love
 now
 and
 you
 fall
 in
 love.
 Love
 that


was
 stronger
 than
 anything.
 For
 the
 love


of
 love.


>> And
 I
 love
 you
 more
 than
 anything.


>> There's
 still
 love.


>> From
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 I'm
 Anna


Martin.
 This
 is
 Modern
 Love.


>> Hello,
 Modern
 Love.
 Hello,
 Modern
 Love


podcast.


>> Hey,
 Modern
 Love.


>> Hi.


>> Hello.
 This
 is
 my
 most
 romantic
 gesture


story.


>> So,
 for
 the
 past
 month,
 we've
 been


asking
 you
 to
 send
 us
 the
 most
 romantic


things
 that
 have
 ever
 happened
 to
 you.


All
 because
 it's
 Valentine's
 Day
 this


week.
 Happy
 Valentine's
 Day.
 And
 what
 is


Valentine's
 Day
 about
 but
 romance?
 But


I've
 been
 wondering
 like,
 what
 does


romance
 really
 mean
 to
 people?
 How
 does


it
 actually
 show
 up
 in
 our
 lives?
 What's


the
 kind
 of
 romantic
 gesture
 you
 keep


talking
 about
 years
 later?
 We
 got
 so


many
 responses
 from
 all
 of
 you,
 and
 I


feel
 like
 I'm
 always
 saying
 this,
 but
 I


wish
 we
 could
 play
 them
 all.
 We
 did


listen
 to
 every
 single
 one,
 though.


Thank
 you
 for
 sending
 them
 in.
 Today,
 we


are
 going
 to
 hear
 some
 of
 your
 stories,


and
 then,
 my
 friends,
 I'm
 speaking
 with


the
 Queen
 and
 King
 of
 Valentine's


themselves.


All right,
 sit
 back,
 relax,
 and
 let
 the


romance
 wash
 over
 you.


So,
 the
 most
 romantic
 moment,


>> the
 most
 romantic
 moment
 of
 my
 life,
 the


most
 romantic
 thing,


>> the
 most
 romantic
 gesture
 that
 I've
 ever


experienced.


>> My
 most
 romantic
 experience
 occurred
 on


February
 14th,
 2025,


Valentine's
 Day,


>> only
 3
 months
 ago.
 Couple
 years
 ago,


>> May
 8th,
 2010.


>> Oh,
 wait
 a
 minute.
 It
 was
 December
 31st,


2024.


>> 25
 years
 ago.


>> It
 was
 a
 Wednesday.


>> No,
 now
 that
 I
 think
 about
 it,
 it
 was


actually
 December
 16th,
 2024


>> when
 I
 met
 my
 now
 wife.
 I
 lived
 in
 New


York
 City.
 He
 was
 stationed
 in
 Hawaii.


>> I
 was
 in
 the
 first
 few
 months
 of
 a


relationship.


We
 were
 standing
 on
 a
 street
 corner
 at


one
 point
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 the
 day


waiting
 to
 cross
 the
 street.
 He
 looked


over
 at
 me.
 He
 kissed
 me.
 And
 meanwhile,


one
 of
 those
 uh
 classic
 trolley
 cars
 was


riding
 by.
 And
 this
 one
 man
 who
 was
 on


the
 back
 of
 the
 train
 saw
 us
 kiss
 and
 he


leaned
 out
 like
 he
 was
 like
 in
 singing


in
 the
 rain
 and
 waved
 at
 us
 and
 he


shouted,
 "He
 loves
 you.
 He
 really
 really


loves
 you.


Um,
 my
 husband
 introduced
 me
 to
 running


long
 before
 we
 were
 married
 and
 we
 were


married
 for
 38
 years
 when
 he
 passed


away.
 He
 encouraged
 me
 so
 much.
 He
 was


my
 biggest
 cheerleader.
 He'd
 write
 me


notes,
 always
 be
 the
 first
 person
 I'd


call
 after
 a
 marathon.


But
 the
 thing
 that
 he
 did
 that
 was
 the


best
 and
 most
 romantic
 thing
 was
 that


every
 night
 when
 we'd
 sit
 on
 the
 couch,


he
 would
 ask
 me
 to
 put
 my
 feet
 into
 his


lap,
 my
 gnarly,
 ugly,
 running
 feet,
 and


he
 would
 rub
 them.


It
 was
 such
 a
 tender
 and
 romantic


gesture.


I'll
 never
 forget
 it.


>> Our
 first
 date
 was
 at
 a
 jazz
 bar
 and
 um


we
 each
 ordered
 a
 drink
 and
 sometime


into
 the
 date
 I
 made
 a
 second
 order
 of
 a


mamu
 which
 is
 a
 date
 cookie.
 It's
 one
 of


my
 favorite
 cookies
 and
 I
 was
 on
 a
 big


mamu
 kick
 at
 the
 time
 and
 it
 was
 just


one
 of
 the
 many
 things
 that
 we
 talked


about
 as
 we
 closed
 out
 the
 bar
 that


night
 on
 our
 first
 date.
 On
 our
 second


date,
 we
 meet
 up
 and
 he
 pulls
 something


out
 of
 his
 pocket
 and
 says
 he
 has
 a


surprise
 for
 me.
 And
 in
 his
 palm
 is
 a


wrapped
 mamu
 cookie
 because
 he


remembered
 that
 I
 said
 that
 I
 liked
 it


on
 our
 first
 date.
 I
 thought
 it
 was


really,
 really
 sweet
 and
 really
 special


um
 and
 quite
 romantic
 for
 a
 second
 date.


On
 our
 third
 date,
 the
 same
 thing


happened.
 He
 pulled
 out
 a
 mamu
 cookie


out
 of
 his
 jacket
 pocket.
 also
 very


sweet,
 also
 very
 cute.
 And
 then
 so
 on


and
 so
 forth.
 On
 our
 fourth
 date,
 our


fifth
 date,
 our
 sixth
 date,
 he
 continued


to
 have
 mamul
 cookies
 that
 he
 bought
 in


bulk
 and
 made
 sure
 to
 always
 have
 one
 to


give
 me
 every
 time
 we
 started
 our
 date.


Mine's
 uh
 not
 very
 grand.
 It's
 on
 the


pretty
 small
 uh
 side
 of
 things,
 but
 I
 am


partially
 deaf
 in
 my
 left
 ear,
 and
 this


results
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 scenarios
 that
 you


could
 imagine.
 If
 someone's
 sitting
 on


my
 left
 side
 or
 to
 the
 left
 of
 me,
 I
 can


barely
 make
 out
 what
 they're
 saying


unless
 they're
 speaking
 very
 clearly
 and


loudly.
 Uh
 if
 I'm
 in
 a
 space
 with
 a
 lot


of
 noise,
 like
 a
 restaurant
 or
 a


concert,
 I
 can
 barely
 hear
 a
 thing.
 That


can
 lead
 me
 to
 feeling
 quite
 isolated


and
 frustrated
 and
 alone
 and
 separate


from
 where
 I
 am.
 Well,
 my
 partner
 who


I've
 been
 with
 for
 about
 four
 years
 now,


anytime
 we're
 out
 somewhere,
 anytime


we're
 sitting
 at
 a
 table,
 maybe
 the


restaurant,
 he
 is
 the
 first
 one
 to
 the


table,
 and
 he
 always
 makes
 sure
 that
 I


have
 a
 seat
 at
 the
 place
 where
 I
 could


best
 hear
 the
 entirety
 of
 the
 group.
 He


does
 this
 without
 me
 asking
 him
 to.
 And


often
 times


I'll
 find
 myself
 forgetting
 and
 not


understanding
 why
 he's
 doing
 what
 he's


doing.
 And
 then
 I
 put
 two
 and
 two


together
 that
 he's
 trying
 to
 make
 sure


that
 I
 can
 be
 as
 comfortable
 and
 a
 part


of
 wherever
 we
 are
 as
 possible.
 And
 that


just
 makes
 me
 smile
 every
 time
 he
 does


it.


Some
 time
 ago,
 uh
 my
 husband
 and
 I
 were


getting
 ready
 for
 bed
 and
 it
 was
 a


little
 bit
 colder
 than
 usual,
 so
 I


decided
 to
 wear
 a
 sweatshirt
 to
 sleep,


which
 is
 not
 something
 I
 typically
 do.


So
 I
 put
 one
 over
 my
 t-shirt
 I
 usually


sleep
 in.


Halfway
 through
 the
 night,
 I
 woke
 up


very
 warm.
 I
 sweated
 a
 little
 and
 I
 was


I
 sat
 up
 about
 halfway
 and
 I
 was
 really


struggling
 to
 get
 my
 sweatshirt
 off


without
 it
 taking
 my
 t-shirt
 with
 it.


So,
 I
 was
 fighting
 that
 a
 little
 bit
 and


I
 didn't
 realize
 I
 must
 have
 woken
 up
 my


husband,
 but
 kind
 of
 out
 of
 nowhere
 and


silently
 he
 reached
 over
 and
 I
 felt
 his


hand
 kind
 of
 grasp
 the
 lower
 part
 of
 my


t-shirt
 and
 I
 was
 able
 to
 then
 easily


take
 off
 my
 sweatshirt
 uh
 without
 my
 the


t-shirt
 coming
 with
 it.
 He
 gave
 my
 back


a
 little
 pat
 and
 then
 he
 rolled
 over
 and


fell
 back
 asleep.


When
 I
 woke
 up
 the
 next
 morning,
 I


thought
 of
 it
 instantly
 and
 I
 just


thought,
 "God,
 that's
 so
 nice
 to
 have


someone
 who's,
 you
 know,
 probably
 dead


asleep
 themselves
 notice
 that
 you're


struggling
 and
 just
 kind
 of
 lend
 a


hand."
 And
 I
 just
 felt
 so
 lucky
 to
 be


with
 someone
 like
 that.


I
 have
 this
 thing
 that's
 really


embarrassing.


I
 am
 superstitious
 and
 I
 have
 to
 knock


on
 wood
 before
 bed.
 I've
 been
 doing
 it


since
 I
 was
 a
 little
 girl
 for
 as
 long
 as


I
 can
 remember.


When
 I
 moved
 in
 with
 my
 boyfriend
 John,


I
 was
 nervous
 he
 would
 catch
 me
 and
 so
 I


would
 have
 to
 slightly
 reach
 out
 to
 tap


on
 the
 window
 sill,
 figning
 a
 yawn,


pretending
 I
 was
 just
 stretching.


And
 one
 day
 he
 did
 catch
 me.


He
 listened
 as
 I
 told
 him
 about
 how
 it's


hard
 when
 we
 go
 camping
 or
 I
 am


traveling
 for
 work
 and
 there
 is
 no
 wood


to
 knock
 on
 nearby.


He
 lay
 silently
 for
 a
 while
 and
 then


said,
 "Can
 I
 make
 you
 a
 knocking
 block


so
 you
 can
 take
 it
 with
 you
 anywhere?"


>> It
 showed
 me
 what
 it
 feels
 like
 when


even
 the
 least
 impressive
 parts
 of
 you


are
 welcome.
 I
 felt
 like
 he
 was
 seeing


me
 and
 saying
 that
 for
 him
 I
 was
 like


freeze
 framed
 in
 the
 world
 and


beautiful.


>> That
 tiny
 1
 second
 smile.


>> It
 just
 felt
 like
 he
 saw
 through
 me
 to


my
 core
 and
 it
 was
 to
 this
 day
 the
 most


romantic
 moment.


A
 long
 time
 ago
 I
 had
 my
 first


boyfriend.


I
 had
 never
 been
 naked
 in
 front
 of
 a


man,
 and
 the
 first
 couple
 of
 times
 I


went
 over
 to
 his
 rooming
 house
 and


stayed,
 I
 was
 nervous.


I
 am
 a
 speckled
 person
 with
 freckles
 on


my
 nose
 and
 cheeks
 and
 dark,
 larger


freckles
 sprinkled
 widely
 across
 my
 arms


and
 legs
 and
 back.


One
 afternoon,
 as
 I
 sat
 on
 his
 mattress


on
 the
 floor,
 I
 drew
 my
 knees
 up
 and


wrapped
 my
 arms
 around
 them
 and


explained
 that
 I
 felt
 self-conscious


about
 all
 the
 spots.


He
 was
 quiet
 as
 he
 kneled
 on
 the
 floor


beside
 me
 and
 he
 slowly
 traced
 the
 dark


freckles
 on
 my
 legs
 with
 his
 finger.


Maybe
 if
 we
 connected
 the
 dots,
 he
 said,


eventually


we
 could
 find
 all
 the
 constellations.


About
 2
 years
 into
 our
 relationship,
 we


got
 into
 a
 huge
 fight
 at
 my
 apartment.
 I


got
 so
 overwhelmed
 that
 I
 asked
 if
 we


could
 put
 it
 on
 pause
 so
 I
 could
 go
 for


a
 walk
 and
 clear
 my
 head.
 And
 on
 this


very
 tearful
 walk,
 I
 came
 to
 the


realization
 that
 we
 really
 don't
 need
 to


be
 fighting
 about
 whatever
 we
 were


fighting
 about.
 It
 was
 really
 silly
 and


we
 love
 each
 other.
 We
 can
 work
 past


this.
 And
 so
 on
 my
 way
 home,
 I
 picked
 up


a
 bouquet
 of
 flowers,
 something
 white
 to


show
 a
 sign
 of
 truce.
 And
 when
 I
 walked


in
 later,
 she
 was
 holding
 almost
 the


exact
 same
 bouquet
 of
 flowers.
 And
 we


just
 cried
 and
 laughed.
 And
 now
 those


two
 bouquets
 are
 sitting
 in
 my
 apartment


almost
 two
 more
 years
 later.
 And
 just


show
 a
 sign
 of
 how
 much
 we
 love
 each


other
 and
 we
 can
 get
 through
 anything.


The
 most
 romantic
 thing
 that
 ever


happened
 to
 me
 happened
 just
 a
 few
 weeks


ago.
 I
 drove
 too
 close
 to
 a
 curb,
 hit
 it


pretty
 bad,
 and
 blew
 out
 a
 tire.
 I
 did


the
 first
 thing
 that
 I
 know
 to
 do,
 which


is
 call
 my
 husband.
 But
 he
 didn't
 answer


and
 he
 sent
 me
 um
 a
 message
 that
 said


something
 like
 call
 you
 back
 in
 a


meeting.
 So
 I
 sent
 him
 a
 message
 back


and
 said
 I
 blew
 out
 my
 tire.
 Here's


where
 I
 am.
 He
 said
 okay.
 And
 in
 a
 few


minutes,
 he
 showed
 up
 still
 on
 his


meeting,
 like
 in
 his
 call
 on
 the
 phone,


and
 changes
 my
 tire
 for
 me.
 No
 question,


no
 complaint,


just
 handles
 it.
 And


I
 felt
 so
 impressed
 to
 be
 with
 such
 a


capable
 human


and
 so
 honored
 to
 know
 that
 in
 his
 mind,


I'm
 his
 to
 take
 care
 of.


One
 day
 I
 came
 home
 from
 work
 to
 find


all
 of
 my
 clothes
 neatly
 ironed,
 folded,


and
 put
 in
 kind
 of
 the
 right
 compartment


in
 my
 wardrobe
 with
 all
 of
 the
 clothes


that
 I
 wear
 the
 most
 at
 the
 front
 for


ease
 of
 access.
 I
 didn't
 even
 realize


that
 was
 something
 that
 he
 noticed
 and


he
 didn't
 even
 bring
 it
 up.
 He
 didn't


even
 think
 it
 was
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal


that
 he
 did
 that
 for
 me.
 Whereas
 I
 think


it's
 the
 most
 romantic
 thing
 I've
 ever


experienced.


>> My
 heart
 just
 swelled
 and
 I
 was
 so


appreciative.


>> I
 was
 swooning.
 I'll
 never
 forget
 it.


He
 just
 looks
 at
 me
 and
 he
 says,
 "You're


so
 cute.
 Can
 I
 kiss
 you?"
 And
 I
 nodded


and
 and
 he
 kissed
 me.


>> And
 he
 just
 took
 me
 in
 his
 arms
 and


kissed
 me
 and
 kissed
 me
 and
 kissed
 me.


And
 then
 he
 said,
 "I
 had
 to
 do
 that."


And
 then
 he
 he
 turned
 around
 and
 he


walked
 away.


>> He
 packs,
 gets
 out
 of
 the
 car,
 comes
 to


pick
 me
 up,
 extends
 his
 hand,
 you
 know,


in
 a
 gentleman
 18th
 century
 where
 he


kisses
 my
 hand,
 draws
 me
 in
 and
 kisses


me
 in
 full
 view
 of
 everybody.


I
 lived
 in
 this
 neighborhood
 where
 one


block
 away
 there
 was
 a
 house
 that
 I


adored.
 It
 had
 all
 of
 these
 beautiful


succulent
 plants
 out
 on
 the
 porch.
 She


had
 these
 white
 twinkly
 cafe
 lights
 that


she
 would
 turn
 on
 every
 night.
 And
 I


would
 always
 comment
 on
 this
 house
 about


I
 just
 love
 this
 house.
 It
 is
 my
 dream


house.
 And
 I
 would
 walk
 by
 and
 I
 would


just
 feel
 so
 dreamy
 about
 it.
 So


Valentine's
 Day
 comes
 and
 my
 boyfriend


comes
 to
 pick
 me
 up
 for
 dinner
 and
 he


says,
 "I'm
 going
 to
 blindfold
 you
 and
 I


want
 it
 to
 be
 a
 surprise
 where
 we're


going
 for
 dinner."


So
 he
 puts
 a
 blindfold
 on
 me
 and
 he


drives
 me
 around
 and
 we're
 driving
 like


for
 so
 long.
 We're
 making
 all
 these


turns
 and
 I'm
 actually
 starting
 to
 get


nervous.
 It's
 like
 I
 I
 I
 don't


understand
 why
 this
 needs
 to
 happen.


And
 then
 I
 feel
 the
 car
 come
 to
 park.


He
 guides
 me
 out
 of
 the
 car.
 I'm
 still


blindfolded.


Steps
 me
 up
 onto
 a
 walkway.


He
 takes
 my
 blindfold
 off.
 And
 we
 are


standing
 on
 the
 steps
 of
 this
 house
 that


I
 love
 so
 much.
 And
 on
 the
 front
 porch


is
 an
 Italian
 meal.


He
 had
 gone
 to
 the
 owner
 of
 this
 house


and
 explained
 how
 much
 I
 love
 their


house.
 And
 she
 was
 so
 flattered
 and
 he


asked
 permission
 to
 have
 Valentine's
 Day


dinner
 on
 her
 front
 porch.


The
 two
 of
 us
 were
 very
 broke
 college


students
 and
 wanted
 to
 celebrate


Valentine's
 Day
 and
 we
 found
 a
 very


fancy
 nice
 restaurant.
 It
 was
 clearly


something
 that
 was
 very
 far
 out
 of
 our


budget,
 but
 we
 had
 a
 lovely
 dinner
 and


there
 were
 these
 two
 elderly
 women
 kind


of
 a
 few
 tables
 down
 from
 us.
 They
 ended


up
 leaving
 and
 kind
 of
 like
 waved


goodbye
 to
 us.
 They
 were
 really
 sweet.


And
 when
 it
 came
 time
 for
 us
 to
 get
 the


check,
 the
 server
 had
 said
 that
 our


dinner
 was
 actually
 covered
 by
 those


ladies.


They
 wanted
 to
 let
 us
 know
 that
 love
 is


all
 around.


And
 I
 still
 think
 about
 them
 and
 I
 think


about
 that
 moment
 because


I
 think
 sometimes
 we
 look
 at
 romance
 as


a
 product
 of
 the
 actions
 between
 two


people
 only.
 But
 I
 think
 sometimes


romance
 can
 be
 found
 so
 deeply
 in


community
 as
 well
 and
 the
 small
 actions


by
 the
 people
 around
 us.
 And
 for
 us
 that


wasn't
 even
 a
 small
 action.
 And
 that
 was


a
 really
 amazing
 and
 a
 really
 kind,


wonderful
 gesture
 for,
 you
 know,
 a
 young


couple
 trying
 to
 make
 a
 Valentine's
 Day


special.
 And
 they
 really
 did.


When
 we
 come
 back,
 the
 king
 and
 queen
 of


Valentine's


The
 stories
 you
 all
 sent
 us,
 they
 were


so
 lovely
 to
 listen
 to
 and
 you
 were
 so


generous
 letting
 us
 into
 these
 tender,


often
 very
 private
 moments
 from
 your


lives.
 So,
 thank
 you
 again.
 We
 did
 have


one
 person
 write
 in
 though
 to
 tell
 us


about
 a
 couple
 who
 does
 their
 romantic


gestures
 very
 publicly,
 and
 I
 got
 to


tell
 you
 about
 them.
 For
 the
 past
 30


years,
 Lonnie
 Anderson
 has
 been
 making


these
 huge
 over-the-top
 Valentines
 for


his
 wife
 Anne
 Buler
 Witherspoon.
 He
 goes


like
 allin.


And
 he's
 kind
 of
 become
 famous
 for
 this.


Just
 about
 every
 year.
 His
 Valentines


make
 the
 local
 news,
 the
 paper.
 People


stop
 and
 on
 the
 street
 to
 talk
 about


that
 one
 time
 he
 made
 giant
 cardboard


flowers
 or
 the
 other
 time
 he
 put
 a


carousel
 in
 their
 front
 yard.
 People
 get


really
 into
 it
 and
 they've
 even
 gotten


involved
 in
 helping
 Lonnie
 make
 these


things.
 So,
 to
 close
 us
 out
 today,
 I


figured
 we'd
 talk
 to
 them
 because
 I
 want


to
 know
 what
 it's
 like
 when
 your
 romance


becomes
 everyone's
 romance.
 And
 I
 just


had
 to
 know
 what
 Lonnie
 had
 planned
 for


this
 year.


And
 Bulger,
 Witherspoon,
 Lonnie


Anderson,
 welcome
 to
 Modern
 Love.


>> Hello.


>> Oh,
 hello.


>> Greetings
 from
 New
 Mexico.


>> Thank
 you.


I'm
 so
 excited
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 too


because
 of
 this.
 Lonnie,
 you
 have
 been


called
 by
 many
 people
 the
 king
 of


Valentine's
 Day.
 Every
 year
 you
 do


something
 for
 your
 wife
 and
 it's
 become


a
 tradition.
 What
 is
 this
 tradition?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I
 would
 say
 I'm


the
 king
 cuz
 I
 feel
 like
 that's


not
 not
 what
 I
 am.
 But
 yeah,
 I
 love
 my


wife
 very
 dearly
 and
 for
 30
 years
 I
 have


tried
 to
 come
 up
 with,
 you
 know,
 a


creative
 and
 wonderful
 Valentine
 for
 her


working
 with
 the
 community
 sometimes.


And


>> he's
 being
 a
 little
 modest
 around
 this


whole
 king
 of
 Valentine's
 cuz
 there
 was


I
 don't
 know
 maybe
 10
 years
 ago
 there


was
 a
 some
 of
 the
 Valentine
 was
 this


photo
 shoot
 that
 I
 was
 a
 queen
 and
 I
 was


gifted
 a
 um
 beautiful
 gown
 from
 the


Santa
 Fe
 Opera
 for
 the
 day
 and
 crowned


queen.
 So
 I
 think
 for
 a
 while
 you
 were


sort
 of
 running
 with
 the
 king
 of


Valentine.


>> Yeah.
 Let's
 give
 people
 a
 sense
 of
 what


we're
 talking
 about
 when
 we
 say,


"Lonnie,
 you've
 been
 giving
 Valentine's


for
 30
 years."
 Give
 me
 some
 examples
 of


stuff
 you've
 done
 over
 the
 years.


>> Lonnie's
 cheating.
 He's
 pulling
 out
 a


list.


>> No,
 you
 should.
 You
 have
 to
 write
 down


30
 years.


>> So,
 we
 had
 the
 National
 Planetarium


reprogram
 the
 dome
 so
 that
 it
 says
 I


love
 an
 in
 the
 stars.
 I
 had
 all
 of
 her


friends
 do
 a
 Valentine
 and
 I
 projected


all
 the
 Valentine's
 um
 downtown
 in


Albuquerque
 on
 a
 giant
 building
 like
 a


20s
 story
 building.


>> Okay,
 my
 turn.
 So
 along
 the
 same
 theme,


one
 year
 Lonnie
 um
 kind
 of
 put
 various
 I


love
 an
 signs
 on
 my
 drive
 home,
 like
 the


commute
 home.
 So,
 some
 of
 them
 were
 an


old
 school


um
 you
 kind
 of
 snap
 the
 letters
 into
 the


signage
 that
 might
 be
 in
 front
 of
 a
 I


don't
 know
 a
 bingo
 a
 discount
 store.
 So,


so
 anything
 that
 like
 all
 the
 signage


you
 see
 around
 your
 neighborhood
 said
 I


love
 I
 just
 I
 just
 switched
 out


>> and
 it
 ended
 with
 a
 a
 large
 I
 love
 an


mural
 in
 the
 neighborhood.


>> I
 love
 that
 one.
 I
 just
 put
 I
 live
 in
 I


love
 I
 love


>> You've
 also
 turned
 the
 house
 into
 a


restaurant


came
 in
 and
 cooked
 in
 our
 kitchen
 and


the
 our
 daughter
 was
 the
 matraee
 for


that


>> and
 we
 had
 what
 the
 most
 famous
 chef
 in


Albuquerque
 come
 and
 do
 it.
 Another


thing
 could
 we
 did
 um


>> you
 you
 did


>> is
 you
 know
 I
 say
 we
 but
 we
 got
 in
 this


big
 historic
 um
 you
 know
 theater
 just
 me


and
 an


red
 curtains
 like
 that
 are
 like
 50
 ft


tall
 they
 take
 two
 people
 lift
 they


lifted
 up
 and
 they
 played
 one
 song
 for


an
 and
 we
 were
 the
 only
 two
 people
 in


the
 audience


>> the
 song
 what
 was
 the
 song


>> it
 was
 so
 beautiful


>> questions


>> oh
 my
 gosh


>> remember
 what
 song


>> I
 know
 I
 need
 to


We
 both
 were
 just
 in
 shock.
 I
 actually


cried.
 It
 was
 so
 beautiful.
 It
 was
 just


so
 beautiful.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 had
 the


symphony
 play
 for
 her.
 Um
 I
 made
 a
 giant


crop
 circle.
 So
 I
 did
 a
 giant
 heart
 with


her
 name.
 So
 her
 name's
 like
 I
 don't


know
 50
 ft
 wide.
 But
 it
 was
 the
 size
 of


this
 huge
 field.
 It
 can
 only
 be
 seen


from
 space.
 You
 I
 have
 to
 know
 like
 how


did
 this
 start?
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the


very
 first
 time
 you
 did
 this
 and
 I
 want


to
 know
 this
 actually
 from
 your
 point
 of


view.
 An
 tell
 me
 the
 story
 of
 the
 first


Valentine
 Lonnie
 ever
 gave
 you.


>> So
 we
 had
 just
 started
 dating.
 So
 we'd


been
 dating
 less
 than
 a
 year
 for
 sure.


>> He
 was
 living
 in
 Portland.
 We
 were
 doing


long
 distance.
 He
 was
 living
 in
 Portland


and
 I
 was
 living
 in
 Albuquerque.
 So
 he


had
 come


oh
 come
 come
 in
 town
 I
 guess.
 And
 I


lived
 in
 this
 very
 small
 space.
 It
 was


barely
 a
 one-bedroom
 efficiency.


And
 he
 sort
 of
 shued
 me
 away
 for
 a
 few


hours
 and
 I
 came
 back
 and
 he
 had


converted
 the
 living
 room
 into
 a
 game


board.


>> Wow.


>> So
 if
 you
 can
 imagine
 the
 whole
 floor,


he
 had
 placed
 a
 huge
 paper
 and
 drawn
 a


game
 board
 much
 like
 a
 candy.


>> I
 just
 made
 like
 a
 Yeah.
 A
 poster
 board.


Giant
 game
 board.
 The
 fun
 part
 was


rolling
 these
 I
 made
 these
 giant
 dice


and
 we
 were
 throwing
 them
 around
 the


apartment


>> and
 you
 would
 roll
 the
 dye
 and
 um
 as
 you


moved
 through
 the
 game
 board
 the
 spacing


you'd
 land
 on
 it
 and
 there
 would
 be


various
 questions
 or
 various
 activities


like
 have
 a
 piece
 of
 chocolate
 pour
 a


glass
 of
 champagne


>> tell
 me
 something
 that
 I
 don't
 know


about
 you


>> but
 that's
 the
 point
 that
 was
 really


like
 the
 the
 crux
 of
 it
 because
 we
 were


in
 the
 beginnings
 of
 our
 courtship
 and


so
 there
 there's
 discovery
 to
 be
 had.


So,
 tell
 me
 something
 I
 don't
 know
 about


you.


>> Tell
 me
 something
 you're
 afraid
 of.
 And


I
 was
 thinking,
 what?
 Who
 is
 this


person?
 Right?
 Like,
 this
 is
 just


>> you
 think
 about
 it,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like,


wow,
 that's
 that's
 crazy.


>> Yeah.
 A
 little
 like
 a
 peacock,
 right?


You
 know,
 you
 kind
 of
 like,
 oh,


>> he's
 doing
 the
 feathers
 and
 the
 strut.


>> A
 little
 skepticism
 perhaps.
 Yeah.


>> Oh,
 absolutely.


I'm
 curious
 about
 what
 you
 said.
 There's


a
 little
 bit
 of
 like,
 huh,
 is
 this
 guy
 a


showoff?
 Tell
 me
 more
 about
 that
 that


that
 sentiment.


>> Okay.


>> Well,
 let
 me
 just
 say
 that
 he
 is
 a


showoff.
 And
 and
 and
 that's
 sort
 of
 what


has
 driven
 a
 lot
 of
 this.
 And
 I
 think


you
 either
 love
 that
 or
 you
 run
 away


from
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 30
 plus
 years
 in,


I've
 sort
 of
 leaned
 into
 loving
 it.


>> But
 was
 that
 not
 your
 first
 inclination?


I
 guess.


>> No.
 I
 think
 the
 first
 inclination
 of


like,
 oh
 well,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 overthe-top
 and
 when
 is
 it


going
 to
 putter
 out,
 right?
 Like
 you


kind
 of
 have
 that
 like,
 huh,
 is
 it
 going


to
 happen
 the
 next
 year?
 And
 it
 did
 and


then
 the
 next
 year.
 And
 so


>> what
 became
 apparent
 in
 all
 of
 that
 is


that
 it
 wasn't
 just
 to
 to
 hook
 me
 or


kind
 of


>> it
 really
 there
 is
 a
 passion
 behind
 it


and
 it
 of
 course
 has
 evolved
 in
 many


ways.
 I
 mean,
 going
 back
 to
 that
 first


Valentine's,


Lonnie,
 what
 made
 you
 decide
 to
 do
 that


for
 the
 first
 time?
 You
 hadn't
 been


dating
 for
 that
 long,
 right?
 You
 didn't


even
 live
 in
 the
 same
 town.
 Like,


>> why
 go
 that
 big,
 that
 hard
 that
 soon?


>> I
 mean,
 it's
 simple.
 It's
 love.
 When


you're
 in
 love
 when
 you're
 in
 when


you're
 in
 love,
 what
 do
 you
 do?
 You
 show


up.
 You
 call
 them
 a
 hundred
 times
 when


they're
 like,
 "Okay,
 so
 your
 friends
 are


like,
 "Don't
 call
 her
 until
 Thursday."


And
 it's
 Monday.
 And
 you're
 like,
 I


called
 her
 yesterday,
 you
 know,
 and


they're
 like,
 and
 you
 know,
 like
 you
 you


do
 crazy
 stuff
 because
 you're
 so
 over


the
 top.
 When
 I
 met
 her,


>> I
 just
 was
 in
 love.
 I
 I
 was
 like,
 I


never,
 you
 know,
 when
 someone
 once
 told


me
 it
 was
 like,
 you
 can't
 make
 someone


love
 you,
 but
 you
 can
 love
 them.


>> Huh.
 And
 and
 that's
 what's
 so
 beautiful


is
 like
 I'm
 not
 in
 charge
 of
 how
 much,


you
 know,
 Ann
 loves
 me,
 but
 I
 am
 in


charge
 of
 like
 that
 I
 love
 her.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


I
 I
 wonder
 like
 over
 the
 years
 as
 you've


gone
 bigger
 and
 bigger
 and
 bigger,
 I


wonder
 if
 there
 was
 ever
 one
 where
 it


just
 sort
 of
 felt
 like,
 huh,
 this
 isn't


quite
 emotionally
 hitting
 in
 the
 way


that
 I
 intended.


>> Oh,
 every
 single
 one
 of
 them.


>> Oh,
 no.
 That
 can't
 be
 true.
 She's
 saying


what
 is
 there
 ever
 one
 that
 sort
 of
 like


you
 spent
 time
 you
 you
 kind
 of
 thought


through
 and
 and
 then
 it
 sort
 of
 was
 like


ah
 it
 kind
 of
 didn't
 have
 the
 ring
 to


it.


>> I
 It's
 so
 crazy
 because
 you
 you
 just
 I


guess
 as
 an
 artist
 you
 you
 just
 always


think
 that's
 it.
 Like
 it's
 every
 one
 of


them.
 Like
 I
 did
 this
 one
 where
 I
 made


this
 I
 spent
 like
 three
 weeks
 maybe
 a


month
 writing
 out
 E
 Cummings
 um
 poem
 I


carry
 your
 heart
 and
 I
 did
 it
 with
 just


rocks
 and
 so


>> so
 each
 rock
 a
 pebble
 then
 was
 creating


a
 letter.


>> Yeah.
 So
 so
 they
 created
 the
 whole
 like


and
 and
 my
 neighbors
 were
 like
 coming


over
 at
 the
 fence
 and
 they
 were
 just


looking
 at
 me
 and
 they
 were
 like
 what


are
 you
 doing?


>> And
 at
 that
 point
 Yeah.
 Like
 really
 I


was
 thinking
 like
 maybe
 Lonnie
 are
 you


might
 be
 mentally
 ill.
 Like
 this
 is
 not


okay.
 Like
 you
 you're
 out
 here
 you're


out
 here
 like
 making
 this
 giant
 rock


palm
 and
 then
 you
 know
 one
 of
 my


daughters
 comes
 over
 and
 she
 picks
 up
 a


bucket
 of
 rocks
 and
 she
 sits
 next
 to
 me


and
 she
 puts
 the
 rocks
 for
 her
 mom
 and


you
 know
 she's
 writing
 out
 the
 thing
 and


then
 I
 was
 like
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


awesome.
 I
 mean,
 Ann,
 you
 know,
 you
 you


see
 this
 finished
 poem,
 but
 hearing
 that


story
 behind
 it,
 I
 imagine
 that
 must


feel
 really
 good.
 your
 husband,
 you


know,
 one
 of
 your
 kids
 writing
 these


poems
 for
 you.
 It
 is
 really
 moving
 and


powerful
 to
 see
 because,
 you
 know,
 we're


talking
 a
 lot
 about
 grandiose,
 but
 it's


the
 smaller,
 more
 subtle
 moments
 that
 I


do
 love
 about
 the
 process,
 the


willingness
 of
 others
 to
 jump
 in,


>> strangers,


>> but
 also


loved
 ones.
 So,
 um,
 Lonnie
 recreated
 an


80s
 prom,
 and
 the
 only
 instructions
 I


was
 given
 was
 like,
 "Go
 find
 a
 vintage


prom
 dress."
 And,
 uh,


>> and
 oh,
 I
 found
 the
 best
 one
 with
 just
 a


pink
 and


>> something
 I
 would
 have
 never
 had
 worn


myself.
 And
 um
 I
 walk
 into
 the
 gym
 and


yes,
 my
 daughters
 had
 been
 involved.


They
 decorated
 and
 there
 were
 balloons,


but
 it
 was
 my
 sister
 who
 like
 took
 it
 to


the
 next
 level.
 She
 had
 her
 80s
 DJ


outfit
 on.
 She
 is
 not
 This
 is
 not
 her


lane.
 Like
 she
 is
 not
 the
 creative
 DJ


kind.
 She
 is
 like


>> Yes.
 And
 she
 had
 so
 much
 fun


>> just
 being
 there.
 80s
 records,
 music


from
 the
 Oh,
 it
 was
 wonderful.


>> And
 and
 those
 are
 the
 moments,
 right?


Like
 the
 really
 just


>> in
 order
 to
 have
 that
 big
 grandiose


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 generous
 moments
 from


other
 people,
 these
 smaller
 moment


>> and
 then
 just
 Yes.
 And
 just
 joy.


>> I
 I
 wonder
 like
 this
 has
 been
 going
 on


for
 30
 years.
 Has
 have
 these
 Valentine's


>> become
 essential
 to
 your
 relationship?


Like
 if
 Lonnie
 wasn't
 doing
 this
 every


year,
 would
 things
 be
 different?


>> We
 joke
 every
 year
 is
 the
 the
 the
 last


year,
 you
 know,
 he's
 there's
 a
 little
 in


in
 what
 we're
 doing
 right
 now.
 He's


like,
 well,
 if
 we
 made
 it
 this
 far,


that's
 it.


>> Even
 this
 year,
 it
 was
 it
 was
 one
 of


those
 crazy
 things
 where
 I
 was
 like,
 you


know
 what?
 It's
 like
 it's
 just
 too


stressful.
 her
 daughter's
 applying
 for


college
 and
 and
 so
 we're
 all
 we
 don't


have
 any
 time
 and
 and
 we're
 just
 we're


all
 again
 we
 we
 we're
 struggling
 like


like
 everybody
 in
 America
 is
 struggling


and
 so
 I
 was
 like
 I'm
 going
 to
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 we're
 going to
 do
 something


private
 and
 we'll
 say
 hey
 we
 just
 we


decided
 this
 year
 we're
 going
 to
 do


something
 but
 this
 this
 group
 of
 people


like
 like
 really
 following
 us
 and
 stuff.


Um
 he's
 walking
 a
 fine
 line
 cuz
 it's


this
 really
 amazing
 group.
 No,
 it's
 not.


>> It's
 not
 that.
 It's
 not.
 It's
 She


doesn't
 know
 what
 it
 is
 and
 you
 can't


tell.
 But
 these
 people
 that
 are
 helping


me,
 they
 are
 like,
 "Look,
 we're
 going
 to


help
 you.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 this."
 And
 I


was
 like,


>> "What?


>> Say
 no
 more.
 Say
 no
 more.


>> We're
 going
 to
 help
 you."
 And
 that's
 it.


I
 won't
 say
 anymore.
 But
 they're
 the


ones
 that
 are
 like,
 "Really?
 They're


doing
 it."
 And
 they're
 sending
 me


photos.
 to
 me
 is
 like
 it
 just
 it
 makes


me
 cry
 when
 I
 got
 I
 got
 a
 text
 the
 other


day
 and
 I
 was
 like
 my
 god
 the
 world
 is


so
 beautiful.
 M


you
 know
 over
 the
 years
 as
 these


Valentine
 have
 gotten
 bigger
 and
 bigger


they've
 also
 gotten
 more
 and
 more
 public


right
 like
 they've
 they've
 moved
 from


these
 even
 though
 you
 know
 the
 the
 first


one
 the
 board
 game
 in
 in
 your
 home
 was


was
 quite
 big
 it
 was
 still
 within
 the


home
 right
 it
 was
 for
 the
 two
 of
 you
 and


as
 the
 years
 have
 gone
 by
 these


Valentine
 I
 mean
 they're
 out
 in
 the


world
 other
 people
 witness
 them
 other


people
 participate
 and
 I
 I
 guess
 like
 I


want
 to
 know
 about
 that
 transition


from
 more
 intimate
 and
 private
 to
 more


public
 and
 and
 I
 guess
 for
 you
 like
 that


feels
 like
 a
 big
 adjustment
 I
 guess.


>> Well,
 there
 definitely
 was
 an
 evolution


of
 both
 just
 like
 the
 giving
 of
 the


Valentine's
 and
 how
 it
 went
 from
 more


personal
 in
 our
 living
 room
 getting
 to


know
 you
 and
 then
 including
 others
 and


and
 being
 built.
 And
 so
 since
 we've
 been


back
 in
 New
 Mexico,
 it
 really
 has


evolved
 into
 a
 community.
 Um,
 people


anticipate
 it,
 people
 look
 forward
 to


it.
 Um,
 I
 laughed
 a
 little
 because
 there


there
 was
 a
 moment
 I
 remember
 being
 at


some
 high
 school
 reunion
 and
 somebody


literally
 turned
 to
 me
 and
 was
 like,


"Oh,
 you're
 that
 Ann."
 Right.
 So,
 like,


>> oh,
 yeah.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 at
 her
 high


school
 reunion


>> and
 it
 was
 sort
 of
 like
 so
 the
 I
 love
 an


can
 be
 a
 mythical


uh
 person
 because
 I
 think
 that's
 sort
 of


some
 of
 what
 Lonnie
 has
 set
 up
 in
 sort


of


>> universal
 love
 and
 an
 invitation
 for


others
 to
 think
 about
 their
 own
 places


of
 love
 and
 sharing
 and
 expanding


themselves
 um
 and
 promoting
 love
 as
 as


something
 we
 get
 involved
 with,


>> but
 then
 this
 other
 part
 of
 like,
 no,


I'm
 a
 real
 person
 and
 I


>> I
 exist
 beyond
 the
 Valentine.


>> Yes.


>> Yeah.


>> Was
 that
 transition
 hard,
 you
 know,
 to


move
 from
 this
 thing
 with
 just
 you
 and


Lonnie
 to
 this
 thing
 out
 in
 the
 world?


Did
 you
 feel
 like
 you'd
 sort
 of,
 I
 don't


know,
 lost
 something
 that
 was
 just
 for


the
 two
 of
 you?


>> Yes
 and
 no.


>> So,
 I
 think
 yes,
 it
 is
 hard.


>> I'm
 probably
 a
 much
 more
 private
 person


>> definitely
 than
 him.


>> Mhm.
 And
 so
 there's
 something
 about
 like


do
 we
 really
 have
 to
 share
 it,
 right?


You
 know,
 I
 resist
 that
 a
 little
 bit.


And
 then
 um
 there
 came
 a
 point
 where
 I


really
 sort
 of
 said
 this
 isn't
 about
 an


anymore.
 This
 isn't
 about
 Valentine's.


Clearly,
 we
 love
 each
 other
 and
 and
 uh


we're
 making
 a
 go
 at
 it,
 you
 know,
 30


plus
 years
 in.


But
 I
 I
 also
 know
 that
 this
 is
 a
 gift
 I


can
 give
 back
 to
 Lonnie
 and
 that
 uh
 it's


larger
 than
 myself
 now.
 And
 I
 I'm
 okay


with
 that.
 I'm
 okay
 with
 the
 idea
 that


it
 has
 moved
 from
 the
 more
 quiet


intimate.
 It
 was
 never
 small
 but
 quiet


and
 intimate
 moments
 of
 Valentine's


towards
 uh
 larger
 and
 more
 inclusive
 and


grander.
 I
 think
 that's
 really


beautiful.
 I
 mean
 my
 final
 question,
 you


know,
 obviously
 I'm
 dying
 to
 know
 what


the
 heck
 this
 year's
 Valentine's
 Day
 is.


I
 know
 that
 we
 cannot
 spoil
 it
 for
 an
 so


what
 I
 will
 just
 say
 I
 say
 this
 with
 all


of
 the
 respect
 in
 the
 world.
 Can
 you


leave
 the
 room
 for
 like
 one
 second?


>> Yes.


>> Thanks
 an
 okay
 Lonnie.
 What
 are
 you


doing
 this
 year?
 So
 this
 year
 like
 I


said
 I
 was
 I'm
 working
 with
 uh
 a
 really


good
 friend
 of
 mine,
 Michael,
 and
 uh
 he


works
 for
 a
 a
 nonprofit.
 So
 this
 this
 is


an
 art
 studio
 and
 he
 works
 with
 lots
 of


folks
 with
 disabilities
 from
 the


neighborhood.
 And
 instead
 of
 giving
 her


um
 a
 box
 of
 candy,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 give


her
 an
 entire
 candy
 store.
 There's
 this


historic
 over
 100year-old
 candy
 store.


It's
 so
 beautiful.
 And
 basically
 what


we're
 going
 to
 do
 is
 they
 made
 this


giant
 sign
 for
 the
 front
 of
 this
 candy


store
 that's
 made
 out
 of
 jelly
 beans.


Like
 thousands.
 I
 mean,
 you
 it's
 like


literally
 thousands
 of
 jelly
 beans


>> and
 then
 it
 says
 Ann.
 It's
 the


traditional
 Ann.
 It's
 hanging
 in
 the


front
 window.
 And
 then
 the
 candy
 stores


agreed
 to
 like
 make
 custom
 candies
 for


her.
 They
 make
 their
 own
 candy.
 So,


they're
 making
 her
 their
 own
 custom


candy
 box.
 And
 then
 all
 of
 these
 people


that
 helped
 with
 the
 chili
 beans,
 they


all
 put
 the
 person
 that
 they
 love


>> um
 their
 name
 on
 a
 little
 heart
 and
 they


made
 Valentine's.
 And
 so
 the
 window,
 the


front
 window
 of
 this
 candy
 store
 is


filled
 up
 with
 all
 of
 these
 people.
 And


so
 I
 think
 like
 it
 to
 me
 is
 just


beautiful.
 We
 have
 this
 whole
 community


and
 they're
 going
 to
 give
 her
 an
 entire


candy
 store.


>> Wow.
 Lonnie,
 I
 mean,
 let's
 get
 Ann
 back


in
 here.
 Call
 her
 back
 in.
 Wow.


>> Ann,
 you
 can
 come
 back
 in.


Yelling.
 Here
 she
 comes.


>> An
 I
 just
 heard
 what's
 happening
 this


year.
 Of
 course,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say


anything.
 Can
 you
 guess
 what
 this
 year's


Valentine's
 Day
 is?


>> No.


>> Well,
 be
 honest,
 too.
 You
 be
 honest,
 cuz


she
 sees
 stuff
 once
 in
 a
 while
 and
 I


always
 think
 like,
 you
 know,
 cuz
 like


somebody
 will
 email
 something,
 she'll
 be


like,
 "Oh,


>> no."
 Because
 I
 I
 like
 the
 surprise.


>> Surprise
 is
 really
 genuinely
 hard
 to


fake.
 Yes,
 that's
 true.


>> She
 does.
 She
 does.
 She
 does
 like
 the


surprise.
 And
 I
 would
 say
 like
 90%
 of


the
 times
 I've
 it's


>> pulled
 it
 off.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 because
 that's
 also
 a
 part


of
 the
 giving
 back,
 not
 just
 for
 Lonnie,


but
 anyone
 involved
 in
 the
 project,
 like


really
 being
 surprised
 and
 in
 the
 moment


is
 is
 something
 I
 value
 and
 I
 and
 I
 want


to
 give
 those
 those


folks
 and
 and
 Lonnie
 included
 in
 that


like
 my
 all
 and
 my
 my
 presence
 of
 of


being
 in
 the
 moment
 with
 them.
 So
 I
 try


really
 hard.
 There
 have
 been
 times
 where


I
 know
 more
 than
 I
 should
 and
 I
 kind
 of


>> but
 this
 is
 not
 one
 of
 those
 times.


>> No,
 not


>> Ann
 Buler
 Witherspoon,
 Lonnie
 Anderson,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 this
 conversation.


>> Oh,
 Anna,
 it's
 been
 a
 pleasure.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Happy
 Valentine's
 Day,
 everyone.
