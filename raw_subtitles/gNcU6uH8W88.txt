哈嘍大家好  
Hello everyone  
我是莊也  
I'm Zhuang Ye  
歡迎您收看莊也雜談  
Welcome to Zhuang Ye's Talks  
今天咱們聊一聊格陵蘭島  
Today, let's talk about Greenland  
您可能會問了  
You might be asking  
那不是莊也雜談加拿大嗎  
Isn't Zhuang Ye's Talks about Canada?  
怎麼話題突然拐彎到了格陵蘭島去了  
How did the topic suddenly turn to Greenland?  
其實格陵蘭島  
Actually, Greenland  
跟加拿大也是有點關係  
has something to do with Canada  
你看美國總統特朗普曾多次公開表示  
You see, U.S. President Trump has repeatedly stated  
出於安全考慮  
For security reasons  
美國一定要拿到  
The U.S. must control  
全球的3個重要的戰略要地  
three important strategic locations in the world  
一個是加拿大  
One is Canada  
一個是巴拿馬運河  
One is the Panama Canal  
最後一個就是格陵蘭  
And the last one is Greenland  
加拿大前兩集咱們談到了  
We talked about Canada in the previous two episodes  
巴拿馬運河  
And the Panama Canal  
離得太遠  
It's too far away  
沒興趣  
Not interested for now  
暫且不談  
Let's leave that aside  
而這個格陵蘭  
But Greenland  
這片與加拿大接壤  
This land, which borders Canada  
被厚重的冰蓋覆蓋的神秘土地  
A mysterious land covered by thick ice sheets  
我就覺得特別有意思  
I find it particularly interesting  
值得咱們深入探討一下  
It's worth delving into  
關於格陵蘭  
There are many questions about Greenland  
有一大堆問題  
A whole bunch of questions  
首先  
First of all  
格陵蘭島到底是一個什麼樣的存在  
What exactly is Greenland like?  
這個島上有沒有人居住  
Is there anyone living on this island?  
如果有的話  
If so, who are they?  
都是些什麼人  
What kind of people are they?  
這個格陵蘭島它到底是屬於美洲  
Is Greenland part of the Americas  
還是屬於歐洲  
or Europe?  
為什麼特朗普對這個島  
Why is Trump so obsessed with this island?  
他是如此的執著  
Why is he so persistent about it?  
他究竟是隨口一提  
Did he just mention it casually?  
還是當真想要這個島  
Or did he seriously want the island?  
好今天  
Alright, today  
就讓我們一起走進這個  
Let's walk into this  
世界上最大的島嶼  
The largest island in the world  
格陵蘭島  
Greenland  
揭開這片長年冰封之地的神秘面紗  
And uncover the mysterious veil of this ice-covered land  
先說一下格陵蘭島它的地理位置  
Let's first talk about the geographical location of Greenland.  
格陵蘭島Greenland  
Greenland  
它是世界上最大的島嶼  
It is the largest island in the world.  
全島南北長約2,800公里  
The island stretches about 2,800 kilometers from north to south.  
東西寬約1,000公里  
It is about 1,000 kilometers wide from east to west.  
總面積是216.6萬平方公里  
Its total area is 2.166 million square kilometers.  
咱們看這個地圖  
Let’s look at this map.  
這個是目前大部分人  
This is the flat map most people see.  
日常看到的平面地圖  
A regular flat map that people usually see.  
你看這個尺寸  
Look at this size.  
就感覺格陵蘭島看上去好大  
It makes Greenland look very big.  
感覺不比加拿大小多少 其實  
It seems not much smaller than Canada, but actually...  
這裡面有一個誤區  
There is a misconception here.  
這個地圖  
This map,  
是因為它這個平面地圖  
is a flat map,  
它的投影失真  
and its projection distorts the size.  
就使得位於高緯度地區的格陵蘭島  
This causes Greenland, located in the high latitudes,  
看上去很大很大  
to appear much larger than it is.  
實際上  
In reality,  
格陵蘭島才200多萬平方公里的面積  
Greenland is only about 2 million square kilometers in area.  
當然確實很大  
Of course, it is still very large.  
但遠未達到您在地圖上看到  
But it is far from the exaggerated size you see on the map.  
這種誇張的尺寸  
This exaggerated size.  
然後咱們再看一下  
Now let’s take a look at  
Google的這個立體的球面地圖  
Google’s 3D globe map.  
你看  
Look,  
這真相就出來了  
Here the truth comes out.  
它其實跟加拿大的省份相比  
Actually, compared to Canada’s provinces,  
格陵蘭島  
Greenland  
只是相當於加拿大的第二大省  
is only roughly the size of Canada’s second-largest province.  
魁省的面積當然比魁省稍微大一點  
Its area is slightly larger than Quebec's, of course.  
魁省面積大概是154萬平方公里  
Quebec’s area is about 1.54 million square kilometers.  
格陵蘭島是216萬  
Greenland is 2.16 million.  
格陵蘭島的面積大約是魁省的1.4倍  
Greenland is about 1.4 times the size of Quebec.  
然後咱們再看格陵蘭島所在的位置  
Now let’s look at where Greenland is located.  
它位於北美洲東北部  
It is located in the northeastern part of North America.  
北部是北冰洋  
To the north is the Arctic Ocean,  
東部是格陵蘭海  
to the east is the Greenland Sea,  
東南方向是北大西洋  
and to the southeast is the North Atlantic Ocean.  
跟它海洋接壤的國家有三個  
There are three countries bordering its oceans.  
一個是冰島  
One is Iceland,  
一個是挪威  
another is Norway,  
一個是加拿大  
and the third is Canada.  
但是跟它陸地接壤的國家  
But the only country that borders its land  
目前據我所知只有一個  
is, as far as I know, only one.  
誰啊？那就是加拿大  
Who? It is Canada.  
有人說接壤嗎  
Some might say it doesn’t actually border.  
這中間不是被海水給隔開了嗎  
Isn’t it separated by sea?  
你看這兒  
Look here.  
就在格陵蘭島和加拿大  
Between Greenland and Canada  
埃爾斯米爾島之間  
there is a small uninhabited rock in the middle,  
這個納雷斯海峽中間  
right in the Nares Strait.  
有一塊無人居住的小岩石  
It’s an uninhabited small rock.  
它的名字叫做漢斯島  
Its name is Hans Island.  
這個小岩石島  
This small rock island  
就在加拿大和格陵蘭島的正中間  
is right in the middle of Canada and Greenland.  
長期以來  
For a long time,  
一直就是兩個國家為了這個小島  
this small island has been the subject of a territorial dispute  
進行這個威士忌戰爭  
between the two countries, often humorously referred to as the "Whisky War."  
有人說什麼威士忌戰爭  
Some may ask, "What’s the Whisky War?"  
沒有聽說過  
Haven’t heard of it?  
這個其實是一種用幽默的方式  
This is actually a humorous way of describing  
調侃兩國之間  
the peaceful, friendly manner in which the two countries  
這種和平友好的解決領土爭  
resolve their territorial dispute.  
端的方式  
Through the method of having a drink and chatting,  
一邊喝酒聊天  
and having a friendly conversation while negotiating.  
一邊打嘴炮談判 - 威士忌戰爭  
Engaging in some diplomatic "talking" – the Whisky War.  
當然雖說只是嘴炮了  
Of course, it’s all just talking.  
但是
But
兩國的領土爭端還是持續了幾十年
The territorial dispute between the two countries lasted for decades.
最後在2022年達成協議
Finally, an agreement was reached in 2022.
這個漢斯小島被一分為二
Hans Island was divided in two.
雙方各占一半
Both sides now control half of the island.
好 咱們說回這個格陵蘭島
Now, let's return to Greenland.
格陵蘭島目前有幾個世界之最
Greenland currently holds several world records.
除了世界上最大的島嶼之外
Besides being the world's largest island,
第二個世界之最
The second world record
格陵蘭島北部海岸線上的Kaffeklubben島
Is Kaffeklubben Island on Greenland's northern coastline.
這個島
This island
是世界上已知的最北端的陸地
Is the northernmost known landmass on Earth.
第三個世界之最
The third world record
就是格陵蘭島的首府努克Nuuk
Is Nuuk, the capital of Greenland.
它是位於北緯64.11度
It is located at 64.11 degrees North latitude.
是世界上最北端的首都或者首府
It is the northernmost capital or city of any country.
比那個冰島的首都雷克雅未克
It is several kilometers farther north than Reykjavik, the capital of Iceland.
還要向北那麼幾公里
It’s several kilometers farther north.
格陵蘭島還有另外一個世界之最
Greenland also holds another world record.
那就是它擁有世界上最大的國家公園
It has the world’s largest national park.
東北格陵蘭國家公園
The Northeast Greenland National Park.
最後一個世界之最
The final world record
但是這個應該說半個
But this one should be considered half.
什麼就是隱藏在冰蓋之下的
It’s the Greenland Grand Canyon hidden beneath the ice cap.
這個全長750公里長的格陵蘭大峽谷
This canyon, which is 750 kilometers long.
這條峽谷的長度
The length of the canyon
它超過了美國的那個
Exceeds the length of the Grand Canyon in the United States,
446公里長的科羅拉多大峽谷
Which is 446 kilometers long.
也超過了504.6公里長的
It also surpasses the 504.6 kilometers of
中國藏南地區的雅魯藏布大峽谷
The Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon in southern Tibet, China.
但是剛才
But earlier
我為什麼只說它是半個世界之最
Why did I say it’s only a half world record?
因為這個格陵蘭大峽谷
Because this Greenland Grand Canyon
目前完全被那個冰蓋所覆蓋
Is completely covered by the ice cap.
科學家們
Scientists
尚未完全瞭解這個峽谷的真實面貌
Have yet to fully understand the true nature of this canyon.
因此說
Therefore,
他這個峽谷是否應該算一個世界之最
It’s uncertain whether this canyon should be considered a world record.
目前存疑
It remains in question.
所以咱們只給他算半個
So we consider it a half world record.
目前官方的主流還是說
Currently, the mainstream official stance is that
這個雅魯藏布大峽谷
The Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon
被廣泛認為是地球上已知的
Is widely regarded as the known deepest and longest canyon on Earth.
最長且最深的峽谷
It is the longest and deepest known canyon.
好 下一個問題
Okay, next question.
也是很多觀眾關心的
This is also something many viewers are concerned about.
就是這個格陵蘭島
Is Greenland
它到底是屬於哪個大洲
Which continent does it belong to?
是北美洲
Is it part of North America?
還是歐洲
Or is it part of Europe?
這個 也是得看你從哪個角度來看
Well, that depends on your perspective.
目前在地理上看
Geographically,
格陵蘭島它是北美大陸的一部分
Greenland is part of the North American continent.
因為因為它位於北美構造板塊上
Because it lies on the North American tectonic plate.
但是從政治和文化的角度上看
But from a political and cultural perspective,
它實際上跟歐洲聯繫了千年以上
It has been culturally and politically linked to Europe for over a thousand years.
尤其是它的宗主國丹麥
Especially with its sovereign nation, Denmark.
目前格陵蘭
Currently, Greenland
是丹麥王國的
Is an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark.
享有高度自治權的一個自治領地
It enjoys high autonomy.
它也是丹麥王國
It is also one of the three integral parts of the Kingdom of Denmark.
三個不可分割的組成部分中
Among the three inseparable parts.
最大的一個
It is the largest.
其他兩個是丹麥本土
The other two are mainland Denmark
和位於北大西洋的法羅群島
along with the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic
格陵蘭是第三個
Greenland is the third one
目前格陵蘭島大約81%的土地
Currently, about 81% of Greenland's land
被厚達3公里的冰蓋所覆蓋
is covered by ice sheets up to 3 kilometers thick
無冰區域
Ice-free areas
僅限于島上沿海地帶
are limited to the coastal areas of the island
大約是寬度是50-300公里左右
with a width of approximately 50 to 300 kilometers
不過可能會有人注意到
However, someone might notice
這個格陵蘭島的南邊沒有冰
that there's no ice in the south of Greenland
這個很正常
this is quite normal
因為它溫度高一些
because it's warmer there
可是為什麼這個格陵蘭島的北邊
but why in the north of Greenland
還有很多地方沒有被冰蓋所覆蓋
there are still many places not covered by ice?
這個怎麼回事
What's going on?
是是因為那塊不夠冷嗎
Is it because it's not cold enough?
是這樣的
Here's the thing
因為那個地方的空氣太乾燥了
because the air there is too dry
而沒法產生降雪
to produce snowfall
而這個降雪
And this snowfall
對於冰蓋的產生和維護是至關重要的
is crucial for the formation and maintenance of ice sheets
是這麼一個原理
That's the principle
但是咱們看南部地區
But looking at the southern areas
尤其是他這個首都努克周圍
especially around the capital, Nuuk
他那的氣候被歸類為極北極氣候
the climate is classified as subarctic
當然聽著嚇人
sounds scary, of course
其實那是可以住人的
but it's actually livable
其特點就是冬季漫長而寒冷
Its characteristics are long, cold winters
夏季短暫而涼爽
and short, cool summers
努克這個小城
This little city, Nuuk
它全年的平均氣溫是在冰點左右
has an annual average temperature around freezing
就是零上0.5度
which is +0.5°C
7月份是努克最溫暖的月份
July is the warmest month in Nuuk
平均氣溫是8.5度
with an average temperature of 8.5°C
1月份是最冷的
January is the coldest
平均氣溫是零下14.9度
with an average temperature of -14.9°C
你看感覺還行是吧
Seems okay, doesn't it?
這個是因為什麼
Here's why
努克地區
The Nuuk area
它受到它旁邊的這個
is influenced by
墨西哥灣流的影響
the Gulf Stream
就使得他這塊的氣溫
which moderates the temperature there
不像其他近北極地區那麼極端
so it's not as extreme as other near-Arctic areas
而且這個努克
And Nuuk
它是位於格陵蘭島南邊
is located on the southern part of Greenland
這個北緯64度左右
around latitude 64°N
地處北極圈以南200公里
200 kilometers south of the Arctic Circle
因此說在努克
So in Nuuk
您連這個極晝和極夜現象都看不到
you won't even see the phenomena of midnight sun or polar night
不過您要是往北邊挪一挪
But if you move a bit further north
去那個位於北極圈之內的
to those areas within the Arctic Circle
一些人口聚集區
some population centers
你比方說位於北緯69度的那個
like the one at 69°N
格陵蘭島的第三大人口聚集區
the third largest population center in Greenland
Ilulissat（伊盧利薩特）
Ilulissat
就會看到極晝和極夜的現象
you will see the midnight sun and polar night
因此說努克這個小城
So this small city, Nuuk
他其實不能代表格陵蘭
actually doesn't represent Greenland
格陵蘭島的真實情況是
The real situation in Greenland is
除了島的邊緣地區有人居住之外
apart from the people living on the edges of the island
這個島內部的絶大多數地方
most of the interior of the island
都是千里冰封
is covered by ice for miles
被永久性的冰蓋所覆蓋
with permanent ice sheets
屬於那種極端寒冷的北極氣候
characterized by an extremely cold Arctic climate
非常不適合人類生存
very inhospitable for human life
當然說到格陵蘭的氣候
Speaking of Greenland's climate
還有一個不得不提的
there's one thing that must be mentioned
就是大家常說的這個全球變暖
which is this global warming everyone talks about
使得格陵蘭島的冰蓋正在融化
causing Greenland's ice sheet to melt
但是它這個融化
But this melting
其實很正常
is actually normal
你只要溶解的速度
as long as the melting rate
不要超過結冰的速度
doesn't exceed the rate of ice formation
這個問題其實就不大
there isn't much of an issue
但是據統計
However, according to statistics
從1980年代開始
since the 1980s
他這個冰層的損失速度
the rate of ice loss
就開始大於新冰產生的速度
has exceeded the rate of new ice formation
而且這個進程是逐漸加快
and this process is accelerating
後來到了2010年代
by the 2010s
這個格陵蘭的冰蓋
Greenland's ice sheet
就是以“至少過去12,000年中“
was melting at the "fastest rate in at least the last 12,000 years"
“最快的速度”在融化著
at the fastest pace
而且格陵蘭島
And Greenland
冰蓋的融化也導致了海平面的上升
the melting of the ice sheet contributes to sea level rise
據統計在2012年到2017年這六年間
Statistics show that from 2012 to 2017
格陵蘭島的融冰
the melting ice from Greenland
讓海平面平均每年增加0.68毫米
caused an average annual sea level rise of 0.68 millimeters
這麼算起來的話
Calculating this way
假設說從今年開始算
assuming from this year
如果格陵蘭島的冰蓋全部融化
if all of Greenland's ice sheet melted
那麼將會導致全球海平面上升7.4米
it would cause global sea levels to rise by 7.4 meters
這個結果就是
The result would be
全球很多的沿海大城市
many of the world's major coastal cities
都會被海水吞沒
would be submerged
這個咱們舉個例子
Let's give an example
咱們說中國
in China
總說什麼北上廣深
we often talk about Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen
北上廣深的 要是海平面上升7.4米
if the sea level rose by 7.4 meters
那除了北京
except for Beijing
其他三個全沒了
the other three would be gone.
但是別怕
But don't be afraid
聽著嚇人
It sounds scary
其實還早著
but it's still far off
即使全球變暖的速度比現在還高
Even if the rate of global warming increases
這個格陵蘭島上的目前這些冰蓋
the current ice caps on Greenland
至少也得需要1,000年左右才能消失
would take at least about 1,000 years to melt away
目前這個格陵蘭島
Currently, Greenland
也是世界上人口密度最低的地區
is one of the least densely populated areas in the world
它的人口密度僅為每平方公里0.026人
with a population density of only 0.026 people per square kilometer
就相當於每平方公里撒一個小手指蓋
equivalent to scattering one fingernail per square kilometer
根據2024年1月份的人口數字
According to the population figures from January 2024
格陵蘭島上的人口是56,699人
Greenland's population is 56,699
島上最大的人口聚集區首府努克
The capital, Nuuk, is the largest population center on the island
他的人口將近2萬
with a population of nearly 20,000
而除了努克之外
And apart from Nuuk
這個島上其他地區的人
the population in other areas of the island
都非常的少
is very sparse
人口排第二的這個
The second largest 
Sisimiut（西西繆特）和排第三的Ilulissat（伊盧利薩特）
Sisimiut and third, Ilulissat
人口都只是5,000左右
each have populations of around 5,000
而排第四和第五的
The fourth and fifth
都是3,000左右
have around 3,000 each
等等等等
and so on
下面咱們就不說了
We won't go into details below
好 下一個問題
Okay, the next question
在島上都是些什麼人
Who lives on the island?
這個問題
This question
得要看你從什麼角度來問
depends on the perspective you ask from
你要是單純從人種生物學
If you're looking purely from the perspective of racial biology
這個角度上來看
then
格陵蘭島上的人口
the population of Greenland
大約有89%是格陵蘭的因紐特人
is approximately 89% Greenlandic Inuit
這個是人種
This refers to ethnicity
不過你要是從國家政治的
However, if you're looking from the political perspective of nationality
角度上來看
then
就相當於問這個格陵蘭島上的人
it's like asking what nationality the people on Greenland are
他算是哪個國家的人
which country do they belong to?
有人說
Some say
我知道 他宗主國丹麥
I know, Denmark is their sovereign country
丹麥人--錯了
Danes -- Wrong
島民們發話了
The islanders speak up
你別提丹麥
Don't mention Denmark
提丹麥我跟你急
Mention Denmark and we'll get upset
俺們自己是格陵蘭人
We are Greenlandic ourselves
但當然這個咱們別看他口頭強硬
But of course, don't be fooled by their tough talk
不過在出國旅行的時候
because when traveling abroad
一拿護照就就露餡了
they give themselves away with their passports
全是丹麥護照
all Danish passports
說格陵蘭自己難道沒護照嗎
Doesn't Greenland have its own passports?
這個當然也有
Of course, they do
而且也是丹麥簽發的
and they are issued by Denmark
你看這個簽發丹麥護照的同時
See, while issuing Danish passports
也同時給他們一個格陵蘭護照
they also issue Greenlandic passports
就是人手兩本護照
so everyone has two passports
而且兩個護照
and both passports
看上去很像
look very similar
至於用哪個不用哪個
As for which one to use
這個島民們
the islanders
你們自己定
decide for themselves
有人說那還用問嗎
Some say, do you even need to ask?
島民們
The islanders
這個民族自豪感一上頭
when their national pride kicks in
那當然用丹麥護照了
then they definitely use Danish passports
有人說怎麼了
Some might ask, what's wrong?
這個民族自豪感怎麼沒了
Where's the national pride gone?
是這樣的
Here's the thing
這個現實很骨感
reality is harsh
因為丹麥護照
Because Danish passports
目前是全球最強大的護照之一
are currently among the most powerful passports in the world
提供對191個國家和地區的免簽證
offering visa-free access to 191 countries and regions
或者是落地簽
or visa on arrival
而相比之下
In contrast
這個格陵蘭的護照
Greenlandic passports
只能提供35個國家的免簽證入境
only offer visa-free entry to 35 countries
在全球排名第223位
ranking 223rd globally
因此說你出國你用哪個護照
So when you travel abroad, which passport do you use?
那還用說嗎
Do I even need to ask?
誰都不傻
No one is foolish
因此說咱們嚴格來說
So strictly speaking
格陵蘭島上的島民們
the inhabitants of Greenland
他既是格陵蘭公民
are both Greenlandic citizens
也是丹麥公民
and Danish citizens
而且
and
大多數的格陵蘭人都會說兩種語言
most Greenlanders speak two languages
一個是格陵蘭語
one being Greenlandic
一個是丹麥語
and the other Danish
當然咱們順便提一嘴
While we're at it, let's mention
這個所謂的格陵蘭語
this so-called Greenlandic language
它其實跟加拿大的因紐特語系
is actually from the same language family as Canadian Inuktitut
是同源的
they are cognate
說白了
Simply put
就是它是從因紐特語發展而來在
it evolved from Inuktitut on
格陵蘭島上
Greenland
形成的幾種方言的這麼一個統稱
as a collective term for several dialects that formed there
看到這兒
Seeing this
我估計很多人都有一個疑問
I bet many have a question
你看這個格陵蘭的宗主國是丹麥
Look, Greenland's sovereign country is Denmark
距離這個格陵蘭島
from Greenland
直線距離是2,100公里
is 2,100 kilometers in a straight line
那問題來了
So here comes the question
這兩個地方是怎麼扯上關係的
how did these two places get connected?
這個就 小孩沒娘 說來話長了
This is a long story, like a child without a mother
格陵蘭島
Greenland
和北歐國家的政治和文化聯繫
has had political and cultural ties with Nordic countries
他已經超過一千年了
for over a thousand years
最早的紀錄是公元986年
The earliest record is from AD 986
在來自北歐的一個史詩文獻中
in a Norse saga
一個綽號叫做”埃裡克紅鬍子“
a man nicknamed "Erik the Red"
的這麼一個北歐人
this Norseman
因為犯了謀殺罪
was exiled for murder
被流放到格陵蘭島的南部
to the southern part of Greenland
然後他就在那塊建立了定居點
and there he established a settlement
並且把他這個定居點所在的這片大陸
and named the land where his settlement was
命名為格陵蘭格
Greenland
就是綠色土地
which means "green land"
你看這個埃裡克到底是怎麼想的
Now, what was Erik thinking?
把一個千里冰封的島叫做綠色的土地
Calling a thousand-mile frozen island "Green Land"
這麼一個名不副實的名字 什麼用意
What was the purpose of such a misleading name?
據說 他的目的是希望通過這個名字
Allegedly, his aim was to attract more settlers
能夠吸引更多的定居者過來
by using this name
所以說格陵蘭島的名字是這麼來的
So that's how Greenland got its name
當然這個咱們回頭想一下它
But upon reflection
它這個名字也不一定是瞎忽悠
the name might not have been completely misleading
因為那個時候
because at that time
就是公元800年到1,300年之間
from AD 800 to 1300
這個格陵蘭島
Greenland
它南部這個峽灣周圍的地區
the area around the southern fjords
它氣候相對溫和
had a relatively mild climate
所以說你叫Greenland
so calling it Greenland
這興許是真的
might actually have been accurate
後來到了13世紀
Later, in the 13th century
就是公元1,200年左右
around AD 1200
有不少因紐特人也因為各種原因
many Inuit also, for various reasons
來到了格陵蘭島定居
settled in Greenland
再往後來
Later on
繁榮了幾個世紀的北歐人定居點
the thriving Norse settlements that had lasted for centuries
在15世紀突然消失
suddenly vanished in the 15th century
就只剩下了因紐特人在島上
leaving only the Inuit on the island
至於這些北歐人
As for these Norse people
消失的原因
the reason for their disappearance
一直是一個歷史之謎
remains a historical mystery
但是有人分析
However, some analysts suggest
一個可能的原因就是
one possible reason might be
大約從14世紀開始
that from around the 14th century
地球上進入了小冰河時代
the Earth entered a period known as the Little Ice Age
氣溫下降
with temperatures dropping
而且
and
北歐人又不如因紐特人這麼適應寒冷
the Norse were not as adapted to cold as the Inuit
因此北歐人就全都走了
so the Norse all left.
還有一個解釋就是
Another explanation is
北歐人去格陵蘭島
that the Norse went to Greenland
主要是為了做（海象牙）貿易
mainly for walrus ivory trade
後來海象牙的價格下來了
but later the price of walrus ivory dropped
在商業上無利可圖
making it unprofitable
於是這幫人就走了
so these people left
當然還有些別的解釋
Of course, there are other explanations
比方說什麼缺乏來自祖國的支持
like the lack of support from their homeland
覺得孤獨
feeling isolated
或者說遭遇了海盜的搶劫
or being raided by pirates
或者說是因為跟因紐特人通婚
or intermarrying with the Inuit
並且被因紐特人同化
and being assimilated by the Inuit
等等等等
and so on
反正甭管什麼原因
Anyway, no matter the reason
這個北歐定居點突然就沒了
this Norse settlement suddenly vanished
之後的格陵蘭島
Afterwards, Greenland
實際上就是因紐特人在控制著
was actually controlled by the Inuit
但是北歐人從未忘記歷史
but the Norse never forgot their history
也從未忘記他們從先輩的歷史記憶中
or the claim to Greenland inherited from their ancestors
繼承下來的
inherited 
對格陵蘭島的主權要求
their claim to sovereignty over Greenland
於是在18世紀初
So at the beginning of the 18th century
當時的丹麥挪威聯合王國
the then-Denmark-Norway union
宣稱對格陵蘭島擁有主權
claimed sovereignty over Greenland
並且開始考慮重新派人去格陵蘭島
and started considering sending people back to Greenland
建立聯繫
to re-establish contact
這咱們簡單說一下
Let's briefly talk about
這個所謂的丹麥挪威聯合王國
this so-called Denmark-Norway union
它是一個在從1524年到1814年期間
which was a kingdom from 1524 to 1814
存在的一個王國
that existed
就是當時的丹麥王國和挪威王國
consisting of the Kingdom of Denmark and the Kingdom of Norway
他們共享一個君主
sharing a single monarch
實行一個共主聯邦制
under a personal union
所以叫丹麥挪威聯合王國
hence called the Denmark-Norway union
當然在這個聯合王國中
Of course, within this union
丹麥是佔據主導地位的
Denmark was the dominant partner
挪威在政治上屬於從屬地位
Norway was in a subordinate political position
後來到了拿破崙戰爭期間
Later, during the Napoleonic Wars
丹麥挪威與法國結盟
Denmark-Norway allied with France
而英國和瑞典則站在反法同盟的這邊
while Britain and Sweden stood with the anti-French coalition
後來拿破崙一戰敗
After Napoleon's defeat
在1814年簽了一個《基爾條約》
the Treaty of Kiel was signed in 1814
丹麥於是
thus Denmark
就把挪威割讓給了瑞典
ceded Norway to Sweden
自此之後
thereafter
丹麥挪威聯合王國 宣告結束
the Denmark-Norway union was dissolved
但是在這個基爾條約中
However, in this Treaty of Kiel
挪威的屬地格陵蘭
Norway's territories, Greenland
冰島和法羅群島
Iceland, and the Faroe Islands
並不包含在割讓範圍之內
were not included in the cession
仍舊由丹麥控制
and remained under Danish control
所以說整個條約中
So, in the whole treaty
吃虧最大的一方就是挪威
Norway was the biggest loser
因此說
Therefore
挪威人不認命
the Norwegians didn't accept this fate
一聽到消息立馬宣佈獨立
and immediately declared independence upon hearing the news
並且推舉了一位新國王
and elected a new king
然後瑞典隨後就對挪威發動軍事行動
but Sweden then launched military action against Norway
迫使挪威接受與瑞典的聯合
forcing Norway to accept union with Sweden
不過
However
瑞典也沒有說是把挪威給逼到死路上
Sweden didn't push Norway to the brink
他後來也允許挪威在內部事務上
they later allowed Norway a high degree of autonomy in internal affairs
享有一個高度自治
to enjoy significant autonomy
然後瑞典和挪威這一聯合關係
This union between Sweden and Norway
一直持續到1905年
continued until 1905
直到挪威通過以和平方式
when Norway achieved full independence through peaceful means
實現完全獨立為止
achieving full independence
好 當然這個說遠了
Okay, that's a bit far-fetched
咱們回到18世紀的這個
Let's return to the 18th-century scenario
丹麥挪威聯合王國
of the Denmark-Norway union
格陵蘭和丹麥之間的故事
and the story between Greenland and Denmark
就是從這個時候開始
begins from this time.
在18世紀的早期
In the early 18th century
也就是1721年
That is, in 1721
由丹麥挪威的傳教士漢斯.埃格德（Hans Egede）
By Hans Egede, a missionary from Denmark-Norway
率領的一支有商人
Leading an expedition with merchants
有傳教士的一個探險隊
and missionaries
被派往格陵蘭島
sent to Greenland
探尋一下
to explore
那個地方是否還留存著北歐文明
whether Nordic civilization still existed there
在島上期間
During their time on the island
這個探險隊就建立起了一個名字
this expedition established a settlement
叫做Godthåb這麼一個定居點
named Godthåb
意思就是good hope
which means "Good Hope"
就是“好的希望”
often translated as "Cape of Good Hope"
經常翻譯成“好望角”
which is often translated as "Cape of Good Hope"
這麼一個定居點
This settlement
這個定居點
was located at
其實就是今天的格陵蘭的首府努克
what is now the capital of Greenland, Nuuk
於是就這樣
Thus,
丹麥挪威聯合王國就控制了格陵蘭島
the Denmark-Norway Kingdom took control of Greenland
把這個地方變成了自己的殖民地
and made it their colony
具體來說
Specifically,
它是聯合王國中下面挪威的殖民地
it became a colony of Norway within the United Kingdom
後來等這個丹麥挪威聯合王國
Later, when the Denmark-Norway Kingdom
在1814年解體
dissolved in 1814
丹麥不是把挪威割讓給了瑞典嗎
Denmark ceded Norway to Sweden, didn't it?
但是原來的這個挪威的殖民地格陵蘭
However, Greenland, which had been Norway's colony,
在條約中卻劃給了丹麥
was awarded to Denmark in the treaty
於是挪威就一直的這個不服氣
Norway was not pleased about this
就心裡一直惦記著格陵蘭
and kept its eye on Greenland
後來等挪威獨立之後
After Norway gained independence,
到了二戰之前的1931年的7月份
in July 1931, before World War II
挪威就佔領了
Norway occupied
當時無人居住的格陵蘭島的東部
the uninhabited eastern part of Greenland
聲稱這個地方是一片無主之地
claiming it was unclaimed land
丹麥一看是立馬抗議
Denmark immediately protested
後來到了1933年
Later, in 1933,
挪威和丹麥就同意
Norway and Denmark agreed
把這個事情提交給國際法院裁決
to submit the matter to the International Court of Justice
等到了1933年的4月5日
On April 5, 1933,
國際法院就認定挪威的佔領是非法的
the International Court of Justice ruled that Norway's occupation was illegal
確認該地區屬於丹麥
and confirmed that the area belonged to Denmark
這個案件被稱為“東格陵蘭案”
This case became known as the "East Greenland Case"
也是國際法院首次處理的
It was also the first territorial dispute case handled by the International Court
領土爭端案件
of the International Court of Justice
從此之後格陵蘭就歸丹麥所有
From then on, Greenland was owned by Denmark
並且獲得了國際承認
and gained international recognition
等這個格陵蘭回歸之後
After Greenland returned
後來到了二戰初期的1940年
Later, in the early years of World War II, in 1940
丹麥被納粹德國佔領
Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany
格陵蘭島與丹麥的聯繫就被切斷了
and Greenland's connection with Denmark was severed
然後
Then,
為了防止格陵蘭落入德國人手中
to prevent Greenland from falling into German hands
美國就跟那個自由丹麥
the United States signed an agreement with Free Denmark
簽訂了一個協議
signing an agreement
美軍打算在格陵蘭島建立軍事基地
the U.S. military planned to build a military base in Greenland
於是在1941年的4月8日
On April 8, 1941,
美軍登陸格陵蘭島
U.S. troops landed in Greenland
並且把對格陵蘭島的佔領
and occupied Greenland
一直持續到1945年
until 1945
後來二戰之後
After World War II
美國就注意到了
the United States recognized
格陵蘭島的巨大的戰略價值
the immense strategic value of Greenland
於是在1946年提出
and in 1946, proposed
美國打算花1億美元的價格
the U.S. planned to offer $100 million
從丹麥手中購買該島
to purchase the island from Denmark
但是他的理由是因為冷戰需要
but the reason was due to Cold War needs
美國需要這個地方來防禦蘇聯
as the U.S. needed the place to defend against the Soviet Union
丹麥當時就是嚴詞拒絶了這個提議
Denmark strongly rejected this proposal
因為這個格陵蘭島
Because this Greenland
被視為丹麥王國不可分割的一部分
is considered an inseparable part of the Kingdom of Denmark
對丹麥的歷史和國家認同
for Denmark's history and national identity
非常非常重要
is extremely important
直接把美國給懟回去了
they directly rebuffed the United States
當然  
Of course  
這個丹麥雖說拒絶了美國人的提議  
Although Denmark rejected the American proposal  
但是也退了一步  
they also took a step back  
因為丹麥作為北約成員國  
Because Denmark, as a NATO member,  
在冷戰的背景之下  
in the context of the Cold War,  
於是就跟美國人  
signed an agreement with the United States  
簽了一個1951年的格陵蘭防禦協議  
for Greenland's defense in 1951.  
從此這個美國  
Since then, the U.S.  
就開始在格陵蘭島上修建軍事基地  
began building military bases on Greenland.  
為後來美國對格陵蘭事務說三道四  
This laid the foundation for the U.S. later involvement in Greenland's affairs.  
打下了堅實的基礎  
It established a solid foundation.  
其實  
In fact,  
當時在島上建設的美軍基地不止一個  
there were more than one U.S. military base built on the island at the time.  
不過後來隨著蘇聯的解體  
However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union,  
美國就不再認為  
the U.S. no longer considered  
北極地區有迫切的軍事威脅  
the Arctic region to pose an urgent military threat.  
是對格陵蘭島的重視程度就急劇下降  
Thus, the attention towards Greenland sharply declined.  
之前所見的這些基地中的大部分  
Most of the bases seen earlier  
都被廢棄了  
were abandoned.  
就只剩下最後一個圖勒空軍基地  
Only the Thule Air Base remained.  
它的位置在這兒  
Its location is here.  
它位於格陵蘭島的西北海岸  
It is located on the northwest coast of Greenland.  
距離北極點是947英里  
It is 947 miles from the North Pole.  
在北極圈以內  
It lies within the Arctic Circle.  
它這個基地  
This base  
也是截止目前為止  
is also, to this day,  
格陵蘭島上碩果僅存的美國軍事存在  
the last remaining U.S. military presence on Greenland.  
它也是美國武裝部隊的最北端的基地  
It is also the northernmost U.S. military base.  
2023年的4月6日  
On April 6, 2023,  
美國政府把圖勒空軍基地的名字  
the U.S. government changed the name of Thule Air Base  
給改了改成叫做 皮圖菲克航天基地  
to Pituffik Space Base.  
至於為什麼改名  
As for why the name was changed,  
實際上就是釋放了一個信號  
it was actually a signal being sent.  
就是美國政府開始關注北極的利益了  
It signified that the U.S. government started paying attention to Arctic interests.  
因此說  
Therefore,  
你看美國最近嚷嚷著要收購格陵蘭島  
you can see that the U.S. has recently been talking about buying Greenland.  
也許就是這條利益鏈條中  
Perhaps this is the most important link in the interest chain.  
最重要的一環  
the most critical part.  
目前這個皮圖菲克航天基地  
Currently, the Pituffik Space Base  
在美國的國防中  
plays a very important role in U.S. defense.  
發揮著非常重要的作用  
It provides missile early warning,  
為北美航空航天防禦司令部  
space surveillance, and space control,  
提供一個導彈預警  
among other information.  
太空監視  
Space monitoring  
和太空控制等等信息  
and space control, etc.  
簡單說完美軍基地  
To put it simply, the U.S. military base  
咱們再把話題收回來  
Now, let's return to the topic.  
看一下1951年  
Let's take a look at 1951.  
當時的格陵蘭  
At that time, Greenland  
對於丹麥來說  
was just a colonial territory for Denmark.  
只是一個海外的殖民地的地位  
It had the status of an overseas colony.  
後來到了1953年  
Later, in 1953,  
丹麥王國給格陵蘭島一個正式的身份  
the Kingdom of Denmark gave Greenland a formal status.  
不是殖民地了  
It was no longer a colony.  
他成為丹麥王國的一個縣  
It became a county of the Kingdom of Denmark.  
正式的融入丹麥王國  
It officially integrated into the Kingdom of Denmark.  
於是島上的島民們  
Thus, the island's inhabitants  
都拿到了丹麥的公民身份  
all acquired Danish citizenship.  
這個格陵蘭島  
This island, Greenland,  
也就跟丹麥本土一樣  
became like mainland Denmark.  
一開始  
In the beginning,  
就是雙方是蜜月期嘛  
there was a honeymoon period between the two sides.  
這個格陵蘭島上的人民  
The people of Greenland,  
在丹麥的細心呵護之下  
under Denmark's careful care,  
見證了這個國家福利政策的  
witnessed a significant increase in welfare policies.  
一個顯著的增長  
They saw a remarkable growth.  
什麼免費教育 免費醫療  
Free education, free healthcare,  
但是在丹麥的這個福利政策裡面  
But within Denmark's welfare system,  
它是含有糖衣砲彈在裡面  
there were some hidden pitfalls.  
為什麼這麼說  
Why do I say this?  
因為丹麥  
Because Denmark  
它有一個比較受爭議的  
has a rather controversial  
“去格陵蘭化”的這麼一個文化同化戰略  
“de-Greenlandization” cultural assimilation strategy  
這個丹麥政府提議  
The Danish government proposed  
格陵蘭島在日常的官方事務中  
that Greenland should use only Danish in its daily official matters  
使用且僅使用丹麥語  
and only Danish should be used.  
並且鼓勵格陵蘭人前往丹麥  
They also encouraged Greenlanders to go to Denmark  
接受高等教育  
to receive higher education.  
於是很多格陵蘭的兒童  
As a result, many Greenlandic children  
在丹麥南部的寄宿學校長大  
grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark.  
失去了與本土文化的聯繫  
They lost their connection to their indigenous culture.  
這就跟加拿大當年  
This is similar to what happened in Canada back then  
在多元文化運動開始之前  
before the multicultural movement started.  
對原住民幹那些事差不多  
Similar to the things done to Indigenous people before.  
當然  
Of course,  
儘管丹麥政府的這些同化政策  
although these assimilation policies by the Danish government  
在某些方面取得了“成功”  
achieved “success” in certain aspects,  
帶引號的成功  
with success in quotation marks,  
將格陵蘭人  
they turned Greenlanders  
從自給自足  
from self-sufficient,  
靠天吃飯的獵人身份  
hunter-gatherers living off the land,  
轉變成了一個城市化的工薪階層  
into an urbanized working-class.  
但是有一部分的格陵蘭的精英階層  
However, some Greenlandic elites  
就逐漸意識到不對了  
gradually realized something was wrong.  
逐漸意識到自己不能失去自身  
They gradually realized they could not lose their unique  
獨特的文化身份  
cultural identity.  
於是在1970年代  
Thus, in the 1970s,  
格陵蘭獨立運動迅速崛起  
the Greenland independence movement quickly rose.  
同時  
At the same time,  
那個丹麥1972年加入了歐共體  
Denmark's accession to the European Economic Community in 1972  
就使得這個相關問題更加複雜化  
complicated this issue even further.  
於是  
So,  
丹麥也開始重新審視格陵蘭島的地位  
Denmark also began to reassess the status of Greenland.  
最終促成了1979年的自治法  
This eventually led to the 1979 Home Rule Act.  
就是通過全民公爵  
It granted Greenland limited self-rule through a public referendum.  
賦予了格陵蘭有限的自治權  
Giving Greenland limited autonomy.  
島上也成立了一些立法機構  
Legislative bodies were also established on the island.  
但是那個時候  
However, at that time,  
絶大多數的控制權還是在丹麥手中  
the vast majority of control was still in Denmark's hands.  
好 你看  
So, as you can see,  
這個時候是1979年  
This is 1979.  
他這個獨立運動  
This independence movement  
也反映在格陵蘭首府  
was also reflected in the capital of Greenland.  
這個名稱的變遷上  
It was reflected in the change of its name.  
這個咱們前面說了  
As we mentioned earlier,  
格陵蘭島的首府努克  
the capital of Greenland, Nuuk,  
他是由丹麥挪威的傳教士  
was founded by Danish-Norwegian missionary  
漢斯.埃格德于18世紀初創立的  
Hans Egede in the early 18th century.  
當時他這個地點  
At that time, this location  
是位於因紐特人的定居點努克附近  
was located near the Inuit settlement of Nuuk.  
在因紐特格陵蘭語中  
In Inuit Greenlandic,  
這個努克的意思就是“海角”  
Nuuk means “cape.”  
然而埃格德  
However, Egede  
並沒有採用因紐特人所用的這個努克  
did not use the Inuit term “Nuuk”  
而是直接把它命名為Godthåb  
but named it Godthåb directly.  
就是“好望角”  
It means “Cape of Good Hope.”  
後來到了1979年  
Later, in 1979,  
格陵蘭獲得自治權之後  
after Greenland gained self-rule,  
這個地名的命名權  
the right to name the place  
就移交給了格陵蘭當局  
was transferred to the Greenlandic authorities.  
那格陵蘭當局 是二話不說立即改名  
And the Greenlandic authorities immediately renamed it,  
把這個城市的名字  
restoring the city's name  
恢復成了當年的因紐特的名字“努克”  
to its original Inuit name, “Nuuk.”  
而之前叫了好幾百年的丹麥名稱  
The Danish name that had been used for hundreds of years  
好望角Godthåb  
“Cape of Good Hope,” Godthåb  
在隨後的幾十年裡面  
was no longer used 
就幾乎不再使用了
in the following decades.
後來到了1985年  
In 1985,  
這個格陵蘭島在實現自治之後  
Greenland, after achieving autonomy,  
退出了歐共體  
withdrew from the European Economic Community  
什麼原因  
Why?  
因為他不同意歐共體的商業捕魚法規  
Because it disagreed with the EEC's commercial fishing regulations  
和對海豹皮產品的禁令  
and the ban on seal products.  
這個歐共體估計您知道  
The European Economic Community, which you may know,  
也就是現在歐盟的前身  
was the precursor to the European Union.  
那是在1992年  
In 1992,  
歐共體擴大了一些成員  
the EEC expanded its membership  
的範圍然後改名叫歐盟  
and changed its name to the European Union.  
這個丹麥  
Denmark,  
這個沒說的  
as we mentioned,  
他一直是歐盟的正式成員國  
has always been a full member of the EU.  
可是這個格陵蘭  
However, Greenland  
他就比較曖昧  
has a more ambiguous status.  
因為他早早退群了  
It withdrew from the EU early on.  
但當然它也不是全退  
But, of course, it did not fully withdraw.  
它藉著跟丹麥的關係  
Through its relationship with Denmark,  
目前跟歐盟之間形成了一種弱聯繫  
it currently maintains a weak connection with the EU.  
就是說雖然歐盟的法律  
Although EU laws  
在很大程度上不適用於格陵蘭島  
do not largely apply to Greenland,  
但是這個格陵蘭島  
Greenland,  
作為歐盟的海外領地成員  
as an overseas territory of the EU,  
在貿易領域還是聯繫比較緊密的  
still has close ties in trade.  
就說他不是正式成員  
It’s not a formal member,  
但是在財政上  
but in terms of finance,  
格陵蘭依然享有歐洲發展基金  
Greenland still enjoys European development funds,  
歐洲投資銀行  
the European Investment Bank,  
以及歐盟各類金融計劃的支持  
and various EU financial programs.  
後來到了2006年  
Then in 2006,  
就是這個格陵蘭自治法  
the Greenland Self-Government Act  
進一步將權力從丹麥下放到格陵蘭島  
further devolved power from Denmark to Greenland.  
這個2006年的法案  
This 2006 act  
頒佈了一項非常重要的決定  
made a very important decision:  
就是丹麥承認格陵蘭人  
Denmark recognized Greenlanders  
對格陵蘭島的歸屬  
as having the right to self-determination over Greenland.  
擁有自決權  
This was very important.  
這個非常重要  
It was very significant.  
後來在2008年  
Then, in 2008,  
又來了一波自治公投  
there was another wave of autonomy referendums.  
格陵蘭又獲得了對自然資源的控制權  
Greenland gained control over its natural resources.  
這個也很重要  
This was also very significant.  
換句話說  
In other words,  
島上這些豐富的石油  
the island’s rich resources of oil,  
天然氣  
natural gas,  
什麼稀土  
and rare earth elements,  
這些自然資源  
these natural resources,  
之前是丹麥王國的財產  
were previously the property of the Kingdom of Denmark,  
如今變成了格陵蘭自治政府的財產  
but are now the property of Greenland's self-government.  
接下來還沒完  
And there’s more to come.  
到了2009年的6月  
In June 2009,  
這個格陵蘭  
Greenland  
又獲得了什麼司法事務  
also gained control over judicial matters,  
警務事務  
police matters,  
等等等  
and so on.  
就是感覺這個格陵蘭是一步步在前進  
It feels like Greenland is progressing step by step.  
丹麥一步步在退讓  
While Denmark is retreating step by step.  
丹麥也是  
Denmark, too,  
就有點這個破罐破摔  
seems a bit like “crash and burn.”  
愛咋咋地  
Let it be, whatever happens.  
這個死豬不怕開水燙的  
The proverbial "dead pig is not afraid of boiling water."  
這個意思了  
That’s the idea.  
目前丹麥  
Currently, Denmark  
僅僅維持著格陵蘭島的一個外交權  
only retains a diplomatic right over Greenland,  
一個國防控制權  
and a defense control right,  
也就是派軍隊負責格陵蘭島的防務  
which means sending troops to handle Greenland’s defense.  
除此之外  
Apart from this  
所有權利幾乎都下放了  
Almost all powers were decentralized  
再往後  
Going further  
這個格陵蘭獨立運動 又得寸進尺  
The Greenland independence movement gained further momentum  
更進一步  
Taking it a step further  
到了2012年  
By 2012  
格陵蘭語  
Greenlandic  
被宣佈為格陵蘭島上唯一的官方語言  
was declared the only official language of Greenland  
把丹麥語給踢出去了  
and Danish was phased out  
當然 這個您知道  
Of course, you know  
這個格陵蘭語  
Greenlandic  
它實質上是一種土著語言  
is essentially an indigenous language  
雖然日常交流沒問題  
Though there are no issues with daily communication  
但是一遇到跟什麼 行政 學術 科研  
But when it comes to areas like administration, academia, or research  
科技相關的這個專業領域  
or any fields related to science and technology  
你還是離不開丹麥語  
you still cannot avoid Danish  
所以說你看  
So as you can see  
這個格陵蘭  
Greenland  
它是一步一步朝著獨立的道路飛奔  
is steadily moving toward the path of independence  
但是  
However  
轉折來了  
A turning point came  
從2012年之後  
After 2012  
格陵蘭的獨立之路突然間戛然而止  
Greenland's path to independence suddenly came to a halt  
就好像大家都不提這事兒了  
It was as if no one talked about it anymore  
為什麼  
Why  
這個其實說穿了很簡單  
This is actually quite simple  
目前這個格陵蘭島上 政府的財政收入  
Currently, nearly half of Greenland's government revenue  
將近一半是來自丹麥的補貼  
comes from subsidies provided by Denmark  
如果格陵蘭貿然獨立  
If Greenland were to hastily declare independence  
失去這筆資金補貼的話  
and lose this financial support  
那麼格陵蘭人的生活水平將急劇下降  
the living standards of Greenlanders would drastically decline  
然後民調就顯示  
Polls showed that  
大多數人並不願意冒這個風險  
the majority were unwilling to take this risk  
不是他不想獨立  
It's not that they don't want independence  
而是擔心沒了丹麥  
but they're worried that without Denmark  
自己活不下去  
they wouldn't be able to survive  
當然格陵蘭政府  
Of course, the Greenlandic government  
其實也意識到了這個問題  
also recognized this problem  
所以說 你要想政治獨立  
So, if you want political independence  
就必須得先經濟獨立  
you must first achieve economic independence  
於是你看  
So, as you can see  
格陵蘭政府  
The Greenlandic government  
為了實現經濟獨立  
in order to achieve economic independence  
那也是拼了  
has been working hard  
這20年來  
For the past 20 years  
積極尋求外資  
actively seeking foreign investments  
包括什麼日本  
including countries like Japan  
台灣 澳洲 中國  
Taiwan, Australia, and China  
但是澳洲咱們不說  
But we won’t talk about Australia  
咱們主要說一下中國  
Let's mainly talk about China  
一開始  
Initially  
中國對格陵蘭的態度就是  
China's stance toward Greenland was  
怎麼說..經濟上歡迎  
Economically welcoming  
政治上謹慎  
politically cautious  
這個原因很簡單  
The reason for this is simple  
格陵蘭一直搞的  
Greenland has always been pushing for  
是積極的爭取政治獨立  
active political independence  
而中國一直奉行的  
while China has always upheld  
是國家的領土和主權不容分割  
the policy of territorial integrity and sovereignty  
這麼一個政策  
that does not allow for division  
如果中國支持格陵蘭  
If China were to support Greenland  
那麼在其他某些方面  
it would be difficult to justify in other areas  
你無法自圓其說  
and it would contradict China’s own policies  
因此說  
Therefore  
中國和格陵蘭雙邊關係也是忽冷忽熱  
China and Greenland's bilateral relationship has been fluctuating  
於是格陵蘭就覺得  
As a result, Greenland felt  
中國對自己不怎麼熱情  
that China wasn't very enthusiastic about them  
我本將心向明月  
I originally set my heart towards the bright moon  
奈何明月照溝渠  
but the bright moon shines over a ditch instead
不過後來  
But later on,  
隨著中國的經濟的發展  
with China's economic development,  
對這個自然資源的需求不斷增長  
the demand for natural resources has been growing steadily,  
再加上過去20年中  
and in the past 20 years,  
格陵蘭的冰層慢慢消融  
the ice sheet in Greenland has been slowly melting,  
就意味著未來島上的自然資源  
which means that the natural resources on the island in the future  
將來這個開採難度將會大大降低  
will be much easier to extract.  
因此說未來的格陵蘭  
Therefore, Greenland in the future  
將會是一片  
will be a  
資源非常富饒的可開發土地  
resource-rich land with great potential for development.  
那中國就不可能對他無動於衷了  
China will no longer be indifferent to it.  
此外你看  
Also, look  
作為21世紀的大國  
As a major power in the 21st century,  
中國也有充分的動力參與北極事務  
China also has sufficient motivation to participate in Arctic affairs.  
要不然對不起大國身份  
Otherwise, it would not be worthy of its status as a major power.  
當然當然  
Of course, of course.  
這個雖說中國跟北極距離很遠  
Although China is far from the Arctic,  
但是中國可以找理由  
China can find reasons  
表面上說你看  
to say, look, on the surface,  
這因為這個極地環境的變化  
because the change in the polar environment  
對全球產生深遠影響  
has a profound impact on the whole world,  
對我們中國也有影響  
and it affects China as well.  
這個北極冰蓋如果完全融化  
If the Arctic ice cap completely melts,  
中國東部的海岸綫是吧  
the coastline of eastern China,  
將後退400公里  
will retreat by 400 kilometers.  
北上廣深 除了北京  
Beijing, except for Beijing,  
另外三個都得被海水吞沒  
the other three (Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen) will be submerged by the sea.  
當然你可以猜  
Of course, you can guess  
對環境的關切  
that the concern for the environment  
其實只是一個表面的理由  
is actually just a superficial reason.  
中國背後關注的  
What China is truly concerned about  
其實還是格陵蘭島和北極地區的  
is actually the huge economic and military interests behind Greenland and the Arctic region.  
背後蘊藏著巨大的經濟和軍事的利益  
Behind it lies enormous economic and military interests.  
於是再往後  
So, moving forward,  
中國再看這個格陵蘭  
China began to view Greenland  
也感覺到格陵蘭越來越漂亮了  
and felt that Greenland was becoming more and more attractive.  
重要性也越來越高了  
Its importance kept increasing.  
於是 各種合作也提上檯面  
Thus, various forms of cooperation began to emerge.  
然後這美國就坐不住了嘛  
And then, the United States couldn’t sit idly by.  
但是這個 說遠了  
But that’s going too far.  
咱們回到今天的格陵蘭  
Let’s get back to today’s Greenland.  
目前的格陵蘭島  
Currently, Greenland  
它整體上  
is overall  
是丹麥王國的  
part of the Kingdom of Denmark.  
君主立憲制內的一個自治實體  
It is an autonomous entity within the constitutional monarchy of Denmark.  
格陵蘭選區  
The Greenland constituency  
在丹麥王國的議會的179名議員中  
has two seats in the 179-member Danish Parliament.  
有兩個議員席位  
There are two parliamentary seats.  
格陵蘭島的名義上的國家元首  
The nominal head of state of Greenland  
是國王弗雷德里克十世  
is King Frederick X.  
但是丹麥的國王只是儀式性的  
However, the Danish king is ceremonial.  
國王任命一名高級專員在島上代表自己  
The king appoints a senior commissioner to represent him on the island.  
就有點類似加拿大的總督  
It’s somewhat similar to the Governor General of Canada.  
但是實際上  
But in reality,  
格陵蘭政府擁有高度自治權  
the Greenland government enjoys a high degree of autonomy.  
自治政府的首腦被稱為“首相”  
The head of the autonomous government is called the "Prime Minister."  
或者是“總理”  
or the "Premier."  
通常是議會中多數黨的領袖  
It is usually the leader of the majority party in Parliament.  
而內閣成員都是由總理任命的  
The cabinet members are appointed by the Prime Minister.  
被稱為“部長”  
They are called "Ministers."  
你看這個格陵蘭的政治制度  
You see, Greenland’s political system  
非常像加拿大  
is very similar to Canada’s.  
你看 這麼一個挺好的  
Look, such a good system  
在政治上享有高度自治的民選政府  
a democratically elected government with high political autonomy,  
按理說  
Logically,  
他們的經濟應該能發展的不錯  
their economy should be developing well.  
但是弔詭的是  
But ironically,  
這個格陵蘭島的經濟  
Greenland’s economy  
可以說是搞得一塌糊塗  
can be said to be in a complete mess.  
這個咱們前面說了  
We've discussed this earlier  
沒有了丹麥  
Without Denmark  
他自己活不下去  
It can't survive on its own  
這個到底是怎麼搞的  
How did this come about?  
這就得說到格陵蘭的經濟了  
This brings us to the economy of Greenland  
關於格陵蘭的經濟  
Regarding Greenland's economy  
咱們咱們先看一組數字  
Let's first look at some numbers  
2021年 格陵蘭島的GDP大概是32.4億美元  
In 2021, Greenland's GDP was approximately 3.24 billion USD  
人均GDP是57,116美元  
The per capita GDP was 57,116 USD  
你看這個數字  
Look at this number  
這個數字不錯  
This is a decent figure  
跟很多國家相比  
Compared to many countries  
格陵蘭島的人均GDP  
Greenland's per capita GDP  
處於較高的範圍之內  
Falls within a relatively high range  
但是這些數字  
But these numbers  
只是表面現象  
Are just surface-level figures  
格陵蘭島的經濟特點  
The economic characteristics of Greenland  
它是規模小  
It is small in scale  
經濟脆弱  
The economy is fragile  
而且嚴重依賴單一產業  
And it heavily depends on a single industry  
說白了  
In simple terms  
其實就是漁業  
It is essentially the fishing industry  
漁業  
Fishing industry  
目前占格陵蘭島的出口總額的90%以上  
Currently, it accounts for over 90% of Greenland's total exports  
也是島上迄今為止最大的收入來源  
It is also the island's largest source of income to date  
但是漁業 這個你知道  
But fishing, as you know  
它是屬於靠天吃飯的範疇  
Is highly dependent on natural conditions  
因此說  
Therefore  
這部分錢非常容易被環境所左右  
This money is very susceptible to environmental changes  
因此這就可以解釋  
This explains  
格陵蘭為了保護他周邊的漁業資源  
Why Greenland goes to great lengths to protect its surrounding fisheries  
到底有多拼  
How hard they fight for it  
你看  
Look  
為了不讓其他的歐洲國家來這捕魚  
In order to prevent other European countries from fishing there  
格陵蘭人甚至不惜舉行公投  
Greenlanders even held a referendum  
在1985年退出歐共體  
To withdraw from the European Economic Community in 1985  
除了漁業之外  
Aside from fishing  
格陵蘭經濟的另一大支柱  
Another major pillar of Greenland's economy  
也是最關鍵的一點  
And the most crucial one  
就是對丹麥財政援助的高度依賴  
Is its heavy reliance on financial aid from Denmark  
最近這些年  
In recent years  
丹麥政府每年向格陵蘭政府  
The Danish government has been providing  
提供大約43億丹麥克朗的經濟援助  
Approximately 4.3 billion Danish kroner in economic aid annually  
這個換算過來大約是6億美元  
This is roughly equivalent to 600 million USD  
占格陵蘭國內生產總值的大約20%  
It accounts for about 20% of Greenland's GDP  
並且占年度公共預算的一半  
And about half of the annual public budget  
此外丹麥還承擔了  
In addition, Denmark also covers  
格陵蘭的司法和國防開支  
Greenland's judicial and defense expenditures  
這些隱形的錢  
These hidden costs  
總額也估計超過了10億丹麥克朗  
Are estimated to exceed 1 billion Danish kroner  
也就是1.4億美元  
Equivalent to 140 million USD  
乾脆咱們這麼說  
Let's put it this way  
要是沒有丹麥的錢  
Without Denmark's financial support  
經濟基礎薄弱  
Greenland's weak economic foundation  
自我造血能力不足的格陵蘭  
And lack of self-sufficiency would quickly lead to its downfall  
分分鐘被打回原形  
It would soon revert to its original state  
格陵蘭的經濟還有第三塊  
There is a third component to Greenland's economy  
就是來自採礦和資源開採行業  
Which comes from mining and resource extraction  
這個咱們前面說了  
We've mentioned this before  
這個島上擁有豐富的自然資源  
The island is rich in natural resources  
什麼石油  
Oil  
天然氣咱們就不說了  
Natural gas, we won't go into that  
還有其他各種礦產  
There are also various other minerals  
什麼稀土元素  
Rare earth elements  
鋁土礦  
Bauxite  
鑽石 紅寶石  
Diamonds, rubies  
鐵礦石 鋅 鉛 金 鈾  
Iron ore, zinc, lead, gold, uranium  
多了去了  
And more
尤其是近一段時間  
Especially in recent times  
隨著格陵蘭的冰層不斷融化  
As Greenland's ice sheets continue to melt  
地下蘊藏的巨大的自然資源  
The vast natural resources hidden underground  
越來越容易獲得  
Are becoming increasingly accessible  
其中最令人關注的  
The most concerning of these  
就是  
Is  
對現代晶片製造技術至關重要的  
The rare earth elements that are crucial for modern chip manufacturing  
稀土元素  
Rare earth elements  
咱們完全可以說  
We could definitely say  
格陵蘭人是坐在聚寶盆上  
The people of Greenland are sitting on a treasure trove  
但是目前來說  
But at present  
資源開採行業  
The resource extraction industry  
占格陵蘭GDP的比重非常的低  
Represents a very small share of Greenland's GDP  
總結一下就是非常有潛力  
In summary, it has great potential  
但是沒有得到充分的利用  
But has not been fully utilized  
這就相當於怎麼說  
This is like saying  
咱們打個比方  
Let's put it this way  
就是說格陵蘭人  
It's like the people of Greenland  
坐在聚寶盆上喝西北風  
Sitting on a treasure trove while drinking the cold wind  
那問題來了  
So the question arises  
格陵蘭島的經濟這麼差  
Why is Greenland's economy so poor  
為什麼不加大力度開發地下的資源  
Why not intensify the development of underground resources  
你看人家沙特  
Look at Saudi Arabia  
你咋不學學人家  
Why don't you learn from them  
你挖資源賣資源  
Dig and sell resources  
掙了大錢  
Make a lot of money  
不就可以擺脫丹麥  
And then you can break free from Denmark  
早日實現經濟獨立了嗎  
Achieving economic independence sooner  
為什麼不呢？  
Why not?  
這個答案其實很簡單  
The answer is actually very simple  
格陵蘭為什麼不開採  
Why doesn't Greenland exploit its resources  
最大的阻礙就是嚴酷的北極環境  
The biggest obstacle is the harsh Arctic environment  
你想 大量的資源  
Imagine, vast resources  
深埋于厚達上千米的冰層之下  
Buried deep under thousands of meters of ice  
開採難度極高  
The extraction is extremely difficult  
而且島上的人口稀少  
And the island has a sparse population  
勞動力短缺  
There is a shortage of labor  
這就使得基礎設施建設以及維護  
This makes infrastructure construction and maintenance  
及資源開採  
And resource extraction  
這成本非常的昂貴  
Extremely expensive  
而且非常具有挑戰性  
And highly challenging  
另外資源開發的另外一個阻礙  
Another obstacle to resource development  
就是在經濟上的慣性  
Is economic inertia  
你看格陵蘭島  
Look at Greenland  
長期依賴漁業和丹麥的財政支持  
It has long relied on fishing and Denmark's financial support  
你依賴慣了  
It's become accustomed to this reliance  
誰還有動力積極進取  
Who still has the drive to actively strive?  
這個打個比方你就明白了  
This is like saying  
你躺著就能吃飽飯  
You can lie down and still get your fill  
誰還天天出去上班  
Who would still go to work every day?  
而且與此同時  
And at the same time  
這個環境的因素  
The environmental factors  
也是格陵蘭政府比較謹慎的  
Are also an important consideration for Greenland's government  
對待工業開發的一個重要考量  
In dealing with industrial development  
這個北極地區  
This Arctic region  
跟其他地方不一樣  
Is unlike other areas  
它生態特別的脆弱  
Its ecosystem is particularly fragile  
一旦遭到破壞  
Once damaged  
這個恢復難度非常的大  
The difficulty of recovery is immense  
因此說正是  
Therefore,  
因為咱們談到的以上原因  
Because of the reasons we've discussed above  
這個格陵蘭島儘管資源豐富  
Although Greenland is rich in resources  
但是在開發和保護之間  
It still faces a dilemma between development and conservation  
實際上還是難以取捨  
In reality, it is hard to strike a balance
不過 怎麼說呢
Well, how should I put it?
這個開發不開發的也不重要
Whether it gets developed or not isn't that important.
你看
Look,
畢竟人家格陵蘭人均GDP是57,116美元
After all, Greenland's GDP per capita is 57,116 USD.
比加拿大高多了
That's much higher than Canada's.
你看 2024年
Look, in 2024,
加拿大的人均GDP也只有53,834美元
Canada's GDP per capita is only 53,834 USD.
看人家生活比我們好
Look, their standard of living is better than ours.
所以說作為加拿大人
So, as Canadians,
也犯不著替他們操心
we don't need to worry about them.
怎麼樣
So,
聽了前面的介紹
After hearing the introduction earlier,
有沒有動心
Are you tempted?
是不是考慮離開加拿大
Are you considering leaving Canada?
移民去格陵蘭住一段時間
Immigrating to Greenland for a while?
有人說太冷 不去
Some say it's too cold and won't go.
你再想想
Think again.
你這一去
If you go,
有可能加入美國....
you might end up joining the U.S....
咱們前面說了
As we mentioned earlier,
美國總統特朗普一再聲稱
U.S. President Trump repeatedly claimed
出於安全原因
that for security reasons,
美國需要控制格陵蘭島
the U.S. needs to control Greenland.
但是你記住
But remember,
這不是他第一次說
this is not the first time he's said this.
在2019年他的第一個任期之內
He mentioned it during his first term in 2019.
他就提到過這事兒
He brought this up back then.
而且咱們再往前看
And if we look further back,
特朗普他也不是第一個
Trump wasn't the first
想拿下格陵蘭的美國政客
U.S. politician to want to take Greenland.
在歷史上
In history,
美國曾多次嘗試購買格陵蘭
the U.S. has attempted to buy Greenland multiple times.
目前已知的至少有四次
At least four known attempts have been made.
第一次就是在1867年
The first time was in 1867.
這個美國的當時的國務卿威廉.西沃德
The U.S. Secretary of State at the time, William Seward,
當時他是以720萬美元買到了阿拉斯加
bought Alaska for 7.2 million dollars.
後來他計劃再接再厲
He later planned to go further.
再花550萬美元收購格陵蘭島和冰島
He intended to spend another 5.5 million dollars to acquire Greenland and Iceland.
以此對加拿大的英國殖民地形成一個包圍
This was to form a blockade around Canada's British colonies.
最終吞併加拿大
And eventually annex Canada.
這麼一個目的
That was his goal.
可惜當時的美國政界
Unfortunately, the U.S. political establishment at the time
還沒有意識到格陵蘭的戰略價值
didn't yet realize Greenland's strategic value.
而且當時美國剛剛結束南北戰爭
Plus, the U.S. had just finished the Civil War,
百廢待興
and was in a rebuilding phase.
兜裡缺錢
Money was tight.
而且
And,
之前買阿拉斯加已經花了一大筆錢
they had already spent a large sum to purchase Alaska.
你想再花另外一大筆錢
Imagine spending another large sum
再多買兩個大冰疙瘩
to buy two more huge chunks of ice.
沒意思
It seemed pointless.
因此這個西沃德當時的想法
So, Seward's idea at the time
並沒有真正的得到實施
was never actually carried out.
後來到了1946年
Later, in 1946,
二戰之後
after World War II,
美國認識到了
the U.S. recognized
格陵蘭島在新冷戰期間的戰略重要性
Greenland's strategic importance during the new Cold War.
於是 46年的時候
So, in 1946,
這個美國總統杜魯門
President Truman of the U.S.
向當時的丹麥政府提議
proposed to the Danish government
以1億美元的價格買下格陵蘭
to buy Greenland for 100 million dollars.
因為美國當時正在準備冷戰嘛
Because the U.S. was preparing for the Cold War at the time.
收購格陵蘭
The acquisition of Greenland
是杜魯門政府全球佈局的一部分
was part of Truman's global strategy.
不過丹麥沒有同意
However, Denmark did not agree.
不過1946年那個收購意向
The acquisition plan of 1946,
是美國政府和丹麥政府私下裡討論的
was privately discussed between the U.S. and Danish governments.
沒有公開
It was not made public.
直到1991年
Until 1991,
媒體才從解密的政府檔案中
the media only discovered it from declassified government files.
發現了這個事兒
They found out about this matter.
後來第三次
then, the third time
也就是2019年
It happened in 2019
特朗普在第一任期內  
During his first term, Trump  
就公開表達對收購格陵蘭島的興趣  
publicly expressed interest in purchasing Greenland.  
理由還是那些  
The reasons were still the same.  
因為這個格陵蘭島戰略地位非常重要  
Because Greenland holds significant strategic importance.  
當然了他那個大嘴巴  
Of course, his big mouth  
他的提議  
His proposal  
肯定遭到了  
was certainly met with  
格陵蘭和丹麥政府的堅決拒絶  
strong rejection from both Greenland and the Danish governments.  
強調格陵蘭島不出售  
They emphasized that Greenland is not for sale.  
最後一次  
For the last time,  
你也知道  
you know,  
特朗普2024年最新的這個提案  
Trump's latest proposal in 2024  
這個大家看新聞也看到了  
This, as we have seen in the news,  
特朗普再次遭到反對  
Trump faced opposition again.  
丹麥政府和格陵蘭政府重申  
The Danish and Greenland governments reiterated  
格陵蘭島不出售  
that Greenland is not for sale.  
不過  
However,  
這個特朗普這次真的是有備而來  
this time, Trump really came prepared.  
早就知道你們倆不同意  
He already knew you two would disagree.  
然後在1月25日  
Then, on January 25,  
特朗普給丹麥首相梅特.弗雷德里克森  
Trump called Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.  
打電話的時候  
When he called,  
這個特朗普就開始放狠話了  
Trump began to make threats.  
就威脅說如果丹麥不出售的話  
He threatened that if Denmark didn’t sell,  
就將對丹麥實施經濟制裁  
he would impose economic sanctions on Denmark.  
而且  
Moreover,  
不排除通過軍事力量獲得格陵蘭島  
he would not rule out using military force to seize Greenland.  
儘管丹麥是北約的盟友  
Although Denmark is a NATO ally,  
然後把這個丹麥政府  
this made the Danish government  
給搞得緊張兮兮的  
quite nervous.  
這個丹麥首相梅特.弗雷德里克森  
Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen  
就聲稱國家進入危機模式  
claimed that the country had entered crisis mode.  
Crisis Mode  
Crisis Mode  
之後您看到了  
As you can see,  
特朗普打恐嚇電話之後  
After Trump made the threatening call,  
第三天也就是1月28日  
on the third day, January 28,  
丹麥就開始遊說歐洲各國來尋求支持  
Denmark began lobbying European countries for support.  
同時我前幾天剛看的新聞  
At the same time, I saw in the news a few days ago  
丹麥高調宣佈  
Denmark proudly announced  
將通過額外花費20億美元  
it would spend an additional 2 billion USD  
來加強北極圈的防禦  
to strengthen defense in the Arctic Circle.  
目的是  
The goal is  
提高該地區的監視和維護主權的能力  
to improve surveillance and the ability to maintain sovereignty in the region.  
你看 然後在丹麥向歐洲求援之後  
Then, after Denmark sought help from Europe,  
1月29日 歐盟的歐洲理事會主席  
on January 29, the President of the European Council,  
安東尼奧.科斯塔  
Antonio Costa,  
就聲明歐盟將全力支持丹麥  
declared that the EU would fully support Denmark  
反對美國的領土擴張野心  
against America's territorial expansion ambitions.  
而其他的歐盟國家  
Other EU countries,  
像什麼德國  
such as Germany,  
法國也紛紛表態  
and France also voiced their support.  
作為歐盟成員國和北約創始成員國  
As EU and NATO founding member states,  
德法有義務共同保衛格陵蘭島  
Germany and France have an obligation to jointly defend Greenland  
和丹麥王國的邊界  
and the borders of the Kingdom of Denmark.  
說一千道一萬  
In a nutshell,  
實際上就是說 各方勢力劍拔弩張  
it means that forces are in a standoff,  
正在拉開架子  
with tensions rising.  
準備開打嘴炮的這麼一個架勢  
and everyone is preparing to engage in a war of words.  
好 這個是政界高層的表態  
Okay, this is the statement from the political elite.  
咱們再看看民間的反應  
Let’s take a look at the public's reaction.  
看看格陵蘭老百姓是怎麼想的  
Let’s see what the people of Greenland think.  
根據2025年1月份的一項民意調查  
According to a public opinion survey in January 2025,  
幾乎大多數的格陵蘭人  
Almost all Greenlanders  
都不願意加入美國  
are unwilling to join the United States.  
6%的人贊成  
Only 6% approve,  
85%的人反對  
while 85% oppose.  
現在問題來了  
Now, the question arises  
這特朗普  
So, why did Trump  
為什麼你想吞併格陵蘭  
want to buy Greenland?  
你到底是真心想吞併  
Is it because you genuinely want to annex it,  
還是你說著玩  
or are you just joking around?  
還是僅僅這個是一個談判策略  
Or is this just a negotiating tactic?  
在談判之前進行一些訛詐  
Trying to create some misdirection before negotiations?  
我覺得  
I think  
他這次可能是要玩真的  
this time he might be serious.  
因為把格陵蘭搞到手  
Because acquiring Greenland  
有以下這些好處  
would bring the following benefits.  
第一個在政治上  
The first benefit is political.  
收購格陵蘭島可能會展現特朗普  
Acquiring Greenland could showcase Trump's  
大膽的領導力和遠見卓識  
bold leadership and visionary thinking  
以吸引他這些基本盤的選民  
to attract his core supporters.  
而且  
Moreover,  
如果川普能夠在他第二個任期內  
If Trump can secure Greenland during his second term,  
拿下格陵蘭  
he will solidify his legacy  
那他的對於美國的功績  
as one of America's greatest presidents,  
可以比肩當年的“路易斯安納購地”  
on par with the Louisiana Purchase.  
他將名留青史  
He will be remembered in history.  
成為一個美國歷史上偉大的總統  
He will go down as one of the great presidents in U.S. history.  
這個對特朗普的吸引力非常大  
This is very appealing to Trump.  
第二個好處就是在環境上  
The second benefit is environmental.  
格陵蘭島  
Greenland  
是全球氣候變化討論的中心  
is at the center of global climate change discussions.  
冰蓋的快速融化  
The rapid melting of the ice sheet  
對海平面上升有重大的影響  
has a major impact on sea level rise.  
另外還有經濟上的重要價值  
It also holds significant economic value.  
這個北極  
The Arctic  
是西歐和北美之間的最短航線  
is the shortest shipping route between Western Europe and North America.  
也是美國對抗俄羅斯的地理前沿  
It is also a geographical frontier for the U.S. in its competition with Russia.  
尤其是這個面積巨大的格陵蘭島  
Especially given the vast size of Greenland,  
它靠近北極的中心位置  
which is strategically close to the center of the Arctic.  
在北極圈  
In the Arctic Circle,  
是一個不容忽視的霸主般的存在  
it is a dominant force that cannot be ignored.  
具有非同一般的重要性  
It holds extraordinary importance.  
當然  
Of course,  
您在平面地圖上可能看不出格陵蘭  
You may not see Greenland's importance clearly on a flat map.  
他的地理位置有多重要  
Its geographical position may not seem significant.  
如果咱們還是看地球儀  
But if we look at a globe,  
你就清楚了  
it becomes clear.  
你看美國首都華盛頓在這兒  
You can see Washington D.C. here,  
俄羅斯首都莫斯科大致在這兒  
and Moscow, the capital of Russia, approximately here.  
而格陵蘭  
And Greenland  
恰好處於這兩個互為戰略對手的大國  
is strategically located between these two great powers, rivals in geopolitics.  
首都的中間位置  
Right in the middle of their capitals.  
而且  
Additionally,  
這個地方還靠近冰雪消融後的  
this area is also near the emerging sea routes after the ice melts.  
北極新興的海上航線  
These are new shipping routes in the Arctic.  
這就使得格陵蘭島  
This makes Greenland  
成為全球航運和貿易的關鍵參與者  
a key player in global shipping and trade.  
因為它會縮短世界上  
because it will shorten the transportation time between the major markets of the world.  
這些主要的市場之間的運輸時間  
The transport time between major markets will be reduced.  
經濟利益非常的巨大  
The economic benefits would be immense.  
此外 這個咱們前面說了無數遍了  
In addition, as we've mentioned countless times,  
格陵蘭融化的冰層之下  
Beneath Greenland's melting ice sheets,  
有巨大的自然資源儲量  
there are vast natural resources.  
包括  
Including  
對現代晶片技術至關重要的稀土元素  
rare earth elements critical for modern chip technology.  
就進一步提高了  
This further increases  
這個格陵蘭島的地緣政治的重要性  
Greenland's geopolitical significance.  
最後一個就是軍事上的考量  
Lastly, there is a military consideration.  
格陵蘭島長期以來  
Greenland has long had  
一直具有絶佳的戰略位置  
an excellent strategic position.  
美國可以在這裡  
The United States can monitor here  
直接監控俄羅斯的西伯利亞的腹地  
Directly monitor the heartland of Russia's Siberia  
這個不用說  
This goes without saying  
同時也能實現當年1867年  
At the same time, it can realize the vision of 1867  
美國國務卿威廉.西沃德的設想  
The vision of U.S. Secretary of State William Seward  
美國是西有阿拉斯加  
The U.S. has Alaska to the west  
東有格陵蘭  
Greenland to the east  
東西兩面 把加拿大合圍  
Surrounding Canada from both the east and west  
等以後想吞併加拿大的時候也方便  
Making it easier for the U.S. to annex Canada later  
因此說 我就覺得  
Therefore, I think  
在前面說的種種的巨大誘惑之下  
Under all the great temptations I mentioned earlier  
特朗普這次可能是要動真格了  
Trump might actually take serious action this time  
接下來就是怎麼動的問題  
The next question is how he will proceed  
當然特朗普要是硬來的話  
Of course, if Trump is determined to push forward  
就是通過施壓  
It will be through pressure tactics  
甭管是經濟施壓 或者是軍事施壓  
Whether it’s economic pressure or military pressure  
我覺得這種施壓方式  
I think this kind of pressure tactic  
當然也不是說沒可能  
Of course, it's not impossible  
但是我覺得難度會很大  
But I think it would be very difficult  
經濟施壓  
Economic pressure  
就是美國說  
Is when the U.S. says  
如果你不賣給我  
If you don’t sell to me  
我就加關稅  
I’ll impose tariffs  
但是加關稅怎麼加  
But how will the tariffs be imposed  
你是給丹麥加  
Will they be imposed on Denmark  
還是給格陵蘭加  
Or on Greenland  
如果是給格陵蘭加  
If they are imposed on Greenland  
咱們前面說了  
As we mentioned earlier  
格陵蘭的經濟主要是打魚  
Greenland’s economy is primarily based on fishing  
財政收入的一半是來自丹麥的撥款  
Half of its fiscal revenue comes from Denmark's subsidies
而且他的第一大貿易夥伴是丹麥
And his largest trading partner is Denmark
其次是中國
Followed by China
再次是歐洲其他的國家
Then other European countries
還有遠東一些地方
And some places in the Far East
跟美國的貿易簡直是微不足道
Trade with the U.S. is almost negligible
所以說 你怎麼給他加關稅
So, how can you impose tariffs on him?
如果你要是不給格陵蘭加關稅
If you don't impose tariffs on Greenland
而給丹麥加的話
But impose them on Denmark instead
那麼你看
Then look
格陵蘭跟丹麥本來就不是一條心
Greenland and Denmark are not united at all
你給丹麥加關稅
If you impose tariffs on Denmark
對格陵蘭能產生什麼壓力
What pressure does it put on Greenland?
這是經濟
This is economic
軍事方面
As for the military side
如果美國真的像特朗普說的
If the U.S. really does as Trump said
發兵攻打丹麥或者格陵蘭
Send troops to attack Denmark or Greenland
這個其實我覺得也也挺難的
Actually, I think this would be very difficult
因為一個是北約和歐盟
Because NATO and the EU
根據條約
Under treaties
他都有義務來保護丹麥
They are obligated to protect Denmark
並且美國國會也不可能支持
And the U.S. Congress would never support it
因為國會裡面還有一半的民主黨
Because half of the Congress is made up of Democrats
民主黨這邊
On the Democratic side
不可能支持川普對歐盟開戰的
They would never support Trump waging war against the EU
再說了 咱們退一半步說
Let’s take a step back
美國真的出兵攻打格陵蘭
If the U.S. really sends troops to attack Greenland
你跟誰打
Who would you fight?
格陵蘭島上真正的軍事力量就是美軍
The real military force in Greenland is the U.S. military
難道跟美軍基地裡的人打嗎
Are you going to fight with the people at the U.S. military base?
還是說直接走進格陵蘭的政府大樓
Or just walk into Greenland’s government building
把這個民選議會給解散了
Dissolve the elected parliament
把總理給趕出去
Kick out the prime minister
然後自己重新攢一個
Then create a new one yourself
美國第51個州的州議會和一個州長
A state parliament and a governor for the 51st U.S. state
人家這麼幹的話
If they do it like this
那剛解散那群人
The group they just dissolved
又全都回來了
Will just come back
這事想想就滑稽
It’s comical to think about
因此說
Therefore
我覺得特朗普如果真的想成的話
I think if Trump really wants to succeed
可能只有一條路可走
He may only have one path to follow
就是只能通過買
It’s only through buying
而且得好好談
And he needs to negotiate well
而且別跟丹麥談
And not with Denmark
你最好直接跟格陵蘭的當地政府談
He should negotiate directly with the local Greenland government
因為你跟丹麥談
Because if you talk to Denmark
他同意了也沒用
It’s useless even if they agree
人家丹麥政府早就表態了
The Danish government has already stated
格陵蘭的未來
The future of Greenland
應該由格陵蘭人自己來決定
Should be decided by the Greenlandic people themselves
唉 這就簡單了
Ah, it’s simple
格陵蘭你看只有不到6萬人嘛
Look, Greenland has less than 60,000 people
美國政府只需要說服3萬人
The U.S. government only needs to convince 30,000 people
這事就成了 有人說不對
Then it’ll be done. Some say no
剛才民調不是顯示
Wasn’t the poll just showing
格陵蘭人85%不同意嘛
That 85% of Greenlanders disagree?
唉 我估計
Ah, I guess
那是錢沒給夠
They probably didn’t offer enough money
假如美國政府 狠一狠心
If the US government makes up its mind
咬咬牙 真的砸500億美元過來
and really decides to spend 50 billion dollars
格陵蘭島上5萬人嘛
There are 50,000 people in Greenland
平均下來就是每個人100萬美元
That averages to one million dollars per person
拿到錢
They get the money
而且還給美國身份
and also receive American citizenship
那結果還真不好說
The result is really hard to predict
你想 你設身處地的想想
Think about it, put yourself in their shoes
你要是生在這個苦寒之地
If you were born in this harsh land
祖祖輩輩都是打漁的
where generations have lived off fishing
天天靠天吃飯
relying on the weather every day for food
靠丹麥政府給口飯吃
living off the support from the Danish government
現在有個機會拿100萬美元
Now there's a chance to receive one million dollars
並且加入美國當美國公民的話
and become an American citizen
這好事你幹不幹
Would you take this opportunity?
要我...那我肯定....這100萬美元有點少
If it were me... I'd definitely... one million dollars is a bit too little
要不再加點
Maybe add a little more
總結一下
To summarize
格陵蘭 這片位於北極圈內的遼闊土地
Greenland, this vast land within the Arctic Circle
擁有豐富的自然資源
has abundant natural resources
和獨特的地理位置
and a unique geographical location
隨著全球氣候變化的加劇
With the intensifying global climate change
未來的格陵蘭
Greenland in the future
在全球氣候變化和國際政治中
will play a more crucial role in global climate change and international politics
將發揮更為關鍵的作用
and will have a key role to play
但是也將充滿變數
but will also be full of uncertainties
面臨著一系列的挑戰
facing a series of challenges
什麼經濟發展 政治獨立
such as economic development, political independence
環境保護
environmental protection
美國的軍事威脅
and the military threats from the US
所以說這個神秘的冰封大島格陵蘭
So this mysterious frozen island, Greenland
如何在大國博弈中維護自身的利益
how it will safeguard its interests in the great power competition
咱們就且拭目以待
we can only wait and see
看看未來還會發生什麼
and see what happens in the future
OK 咱們今天時間也到了
OK, that's all for today
