Can I ask a very basic question,
which is, given all the hurdles
that we've talked about
to developing Venezuela's oil industry,
and the vast amounts of capital and time
that this will seem to need to take.
Is this really about oil?
I don't think so.
But I think for the president,
it might be.
Explain. And let let me unpack that.
So, President, President Donald Trump
does seem to think about oil a lot.
He talks about it
a lot, and always has done.
I mean, this is you can go back and see
his public record is someone
who's been in the public eye for decades.
And he talks about gasoline and oil
quite a lot.
It seems to be quite central
to his view of the world,
the global economy and domestic politics.
And I think to some extent,
his viewpoint is kind of locked
in the 1980s, maybe the early 1990s.
He sees oil as being sensitive,
to geopolitical action.
He sees it as being a resource
that is coveted,
that is important
to have in large quantities.
And he sees the price as being crucial.
You have to keep the price of oil low.
So you need as much oil on the market
as you can,
so that gasoline prices don't go up.
That view is a little outdated
at this point,
particularly from the point of view
of the United States.
The US is now the world's
largest oil producer.
It produces more oil
than any nation has done in history
and is likely to remain
so for the foreseeable future.
The U.S.
doesn't import nearly as much crude
as it used to.
Also, most of its crude imports
now come from relatively safe
places, Canada being first among them.
Putting aside the any risk of,
you know, disruption of the US, Canada
bilateral relationship, the U.S.
can get a lot of its crude
from very safe, secure places.
It doesn't need oil from Venezuela.
And quite frankly,
neither does anybody else.
There's
quite a lot of supply sloshing around.
There's available supply
from other sources
that are cheaper, that are safer,
that are more competitive.
So framing this as a move to seize
oil has always been a little bit hard
for me to accept, except
from the point of view of the president.
Specifically, what does the U.S. want?
Yeah, the official mind
of the United States, right.
As a as a policymaking, bureaucracy,
as a as a as a great power.
I think this was first
and foremost about demonstrating U.S.
primacy in the Western Hemisphere.
You know,
I do think there is a brain trust
now that sees a resurgent Monroe
Doctrine or Don
Rowe Doctrine, whatever
you want to call it, as being a priority.
You know that the U.S.
should shift its viewpoint away from
places like Europe in the Middle East,
and should concentrate its attention
on the Western Hemisphere and doing this,
putting a lot of pressure on a state
that has been a US adversary.
Putting aside
the fact that it's an oil producer,
you know, Venezuela has been anti-U.S.
for a long time, putting a lot of pressure
on this state, erecting an oil blockade,
putting a bounty
on the head of its president,
and then flying in Delta Force to kidnap
the president, take him out and put him on
trial in the US, sends a very strong
signal to everyone that the US
is now going to be exercising its primacy
in a much more aggressive way.
And I think for the for for Trump, I think
there's an allure in making this about,
you know,
materials and making it about energy
and making it about energy security.
But at the end of the day,
as we've been saying,
I don't think companies are going to
get interested or involved any time soon.
And gasoline prices
are going to remain low for reasons
that have nothing to do
with what the US is doing in Venezuela.
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and. I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy, quite a start to the year. Yes.
I mean, I was actually at this point
I wasn't even predicted it.
I wasn't even holding out hope
that it might be a little bit quiet.
At least for the first week of the year,
I've just.
I've given up
on that, particular ambition.
But you're right.
We had some huge news
breaking over the weekend.
It's not just that
it happened on the Saturday.
And of course, we were talking about,
the arrest of, Maduro.
It's not just that happened on Saturday.
It happened at five in the morning or so.
They got to Saturday.
So I woke up and I already had DMs.
They're like, are you guys going to do
an episode or an episode on what?
What are you talking about?
And then it's sort of five minutes.
What? He's in custody.
What happened?
I don't understand that. At all.
But, yeah, it's, sort of a
a geopolitical, a genuine earthquake.
I would say that sort of.
It's a cliche that gets overused,
but this feels like an earthquake.
Yeah,
there are a lot of firsts involved here.
So, like the first major U.S.
intervention in South America since, like,
I guess the 80s,
the first time
the US seems to have been this explicit
about going into a country
because of its oil reserves.
Yeah, that was surprising.
Yeah, that's the super interesting thing.
It's like it's not clear that,
you know, in the past at least, like, oh,
it's about spreading democracy.
And I think one of the, I guess funnier.
And I'm putting that in quotes
because none of this is like particularly
funny per se, but it's like there's no
pretense of like,
oh, this opposition leader
who just won the Nobel Prize that she's
going to get a shot or anything like that.
It's a very strange.
It's so, it's still face value.
My, my interpretation is Trump
wanted Maduro gone and got Maduro gone.
And the idea
that they're going to dress it up
in some obvious ideology or principle
other than maybe dominating
the hemisphere, does not seem
to have entered the equation.
But, but. But.
It might not be face value.
And this is not right.
This is not
what we're going to talk about today.
But there is a theory going round
that it's not really because
of the oil reserves.
It's because of, rare earth
mining in Venezuela,
much of which was making its way to China
through various means.
To all kinds of no one.
Yeah, that's a thing. There's like.
No. Like. Yes.
So you can imagine that telling Americans,
you know, we've
we've kidnaped a dictator
and arrested him for drug
trafficking and the bonus is
you're going to get cheaper gas prices.
That probably resonates a little bit
more than like, well, we really needed,
you know, some rare Earth
like tantalum or something like that
that you've never heard of.
Yeah. No,
I have, like, a million questions.
I'm just trying.
So, so many people have a million
questions also, like, I don't know, like,
is this totally unprecedented in terms of
you just snatch a foreign leader?
I'm amazed that this could, like, happen.
It seems like a possible like
it seems like almost uneventful
in the way, like they just went in
and took a foreign leader.
You think that they'd be fortified
with thousands and thousands of guards
and some impenetrable palace are evidently
not all just sort of
still a complete mystery of like,
what exactly happened
and what exactly it means
and where it's going and all that stuff.
All right.
The immediate reaction, though, in markets
and the global economy was
what does this mean for the oil?
Yeah, yeah.
Because supposedly Venezuela is the holder
of the biggest reserve of crude oil.
Yeah.
Something like 300 billion barrels
is the number that you see, which again
places that above noted exporters
like Saudi Arabia.
Right.
But the issue is it
hasn't actually been pulling much of that
out of the ground for many, many years.
It's been producing,
I think like a million barrels per day.
Right.
The numbers that people are talking about
to actually improve
the Venezuelan oil
infrastructure are staggering.
So reserves mean nothing
if you can't pull it out of the ground.
If you don't have the infrastructure
to do that,
and then who's going to pay for it
at a time when oil is below $60?
I don't know how economical that.
So many questions. Anyway.
We don't need to just keep restating
other, all the questions.
Ask. Each other.
That's why we now that's
why we have guests on this show,
because we'd like to ask them questions.
Anyway.
We're excited to say
we really do have the perfect guest,
someone we've talked to in the past,
including an episode about,
the oil reserves in Guyana, which,
of course, is also part of this story
because their neighbors
and they have contested,
some of their reserves are contested
between the two countries.
We're going to be speaking,
of course, to Gregory Brew
senior analyst at the Eurasia Group.
So, Greg,
thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots
Thank you so much for having me back.
How did you find out?
What was your Saturday morning like?
So my Saturday morning started
very early as,
all my mornings do now
because I have a 15 month old at home.
So I was making coffee
and I was doing what I always do,
which is, checking Twitter
or whatever you call it.
And I immediately saw, you know,
cryptic, vague tweets about something
that had happened that was shocking,
that had to do with Venezuela.
And after about five minutes,
I saw that, oh, no, we went in
and kidnaped the president, seized him,
apprehended him.
You know, rockets were fired, helicopters
flew over Caracas.
It was all very dramatic.
And my immediate thought was, you know,
what does this mean for oil markets?
Then I remembered
that it was Saturday morning.
And we could get. Action.
Yeah,
for 36 hours until Asian markets opened.
I thought, that's interesting.
You know,
these things always seem to happen
on weekends now because whoever is pulling
the trigger wants to make sure
they put some space between themselves
and, and the market reaction.
Can I just say I had a blissful four hours
between this actually happening
and me finding out on Saturday morning
because I had a friend over,
we had an old fashioned sleepover,
which was kind of fun,
and I was serving her coffee,
and we were just talking.
And then, like,
I showed her the door, immediately
looked at my phone and was like,
okay, well, that's the end of my nice,
relaxing weekend.
Wait. That's right. More about that.
That's incredible restraint to like,
spend a morning with a friend
without like half paying attention
to the phone because.
Thank you, thank you.
I know it's unusual for you.
That would be very hard. Yeah, yeah.
All right, let's start with, like, let's
let's look at some of our priors here.
So Venezuelan oil reserves.
I have seen some debate around that 300
billion number, particularly
from John Arnold, the hedge fund guy.
He was saying that this was a reserve
figure
that seemed to be magically produced
by Chavez, the previous Venezuelan leader.
And before that, the,
proven reserves number,
the one that had actually been
audited, was a lot lower.
So do we actually know
that Venezuela has a lot of oil?
Well, you know, this this conversation
could get very technical very quickly.
Go ahead.
Please let we can yeah.
Let's let's dive
in. What are oil reserves?
So first you start with the technically
recoverable reserves, i.e.
you know, what is the oil in the ground.
What have you discovered
through a geological survey's
through drilling test wells, etc.?
From that point of view, Venezuela
could have as much as a trillion barrels,
within its territory in the Maracaibo
Basin, the west,
but also, most significantly
in the Orinoco basin in the east
and southeast of the country,
which is where this very heavy,
heavy, extra heavy sour crude is located.
It's probably the largest continuous
reserve of oil in the world.
Its rivals would be the tar
sands of Alberta and the Guevarra Field
in eastern Saudi Arabia.
So technically there is
maybe a trillion barrels of oil there.
But when we get down to
what is recoverable, you know, the US
Geological Survey,
did a report on this in, I think, 2009,
and the figure they landed on was between
400 and 500 billion barrels
of what you could pull out of the ground.
You know, if not, not counting on price,
not counting on
how much money you were willing to spend.
Then we get to proven reserves.
And proven reserves
are a function of price, profitability,
available investment, security,
you know, assessing risks,
how much you need to pay
if you're an international oil company,
how much you need to split
with the national government, all of that.
And that's
where we get a much more fuzzy figure.
You know, OPEC,
they have figures on proven reserves.
The Energy Information Administration
of the United States puts out
proven reserve
figures on various countries.
When it comes to Venezuela.
There is that, that incident of the Hugo
Chavez government radically
upgrading the amount of oil that they said
was recoverable in, I think it was 2007.
The thing about that, though,
is that at the time, Brant, crude
prices were upwards of $100 a barrel,
so the price of oil was very high.
Cut to today where, you know, adjusting
for inflation, the price is very low.
It's $60 a barrel.
But, you know, compared to the price
in 2007, it's even lower than that.
So saying that Venezuela has 300
billion barrels of oil
that you could pull out of the ground
right now just isn't accurate.
The oil is there.
But trying to get it out
in the current market conditions,
given all the risks involved,
the security concerns,
the upheaval in Venezuela,
and then just the amount of money
you would need to upgrade
the infrastructure and to drill the wells,
the figure is much lower than 300 billion.
It's a lot.
Neighboring Guyana, has proven reserves
of around 20 billion barrels.
And there's at least twice that in
the McCabe basin in the west of Venezuela.
So there is a lot of oil there.
But whether it approaches 300 billion
barrels is, is the subject of much debate.
When oil prices,
when the oil market open on Sunday night,
there really hasn't
been much of a reaction.
And I think it's sort of intuitive,
which is that
you could come up with any number
you want 100, a trillion, 300 billion,
100 billion in the medium, the short term.
What matters, I presume,
is capacity to pump barrels and sell them.
And one of the things that we've seen,
we've seen the discharge of how Venezuelan
oil production over the years
has dropped off quite precipitously.
And there are various
sort of potential drivers,
including maybe price, maybe sanctions.
But also there's story that the,
you know, the, the socialist government
that that nationalized a lot of the oil
infrastructure
has let the oil infrastructure
deteriorate.
Give us your read.
Like I know where
I don't literally have a chart here,
but if you could like have that chart,
in your mind.
Everyone
imagine a chart of a line going down.
Mostly down.
Why don't you like,
tell us the story of that chart?
Sure, sure. I love describing charts.
And I'm also, you know, as as Joe well
knows Tracy, you probably know as well.
I'm a historian by training,
so I love to go back in time
and start at the beginning
and the beginning.
For Venezuela, oil is over 100 years ago.
Venezuela is one of the oldest
oil producers in the world.
You know, first began to commercially
produce crude in the 1920s, 1930s.
For a while, you know, close to 30 years.
It was arguably the second most important
oil producer in the world
and in the Western Hemisphere,
because it was so close
to the United States,
it was sending a lot of its crude
to the US.
This was before the Middle East
became a major concern in the 50s.
And 60s. You know,
Venezuela has been around for a long time.
It's pumped a lot of crude.
When we think about the chart
for Venezuela oil production,
it's actually, you know, it's it's
less of a, collapse in the last 20 years.
If you look at it, it's more of a w
Venezuela crude output goes up and up
and up from the 20s
all the way up to the early 70s,
where it exceeds 3 million barrels a day.
That is, I believe, the historic peak
for Venezuela output
in, in the mid 1970s, Venezuela
produced production starts to fall.
It falls quite sharply.
There are a lot of reasons for that,
one of which is the Middle East.
You know, they were facing much stiffer
competition, cheaper producers,
you know,
they had to, investment was being cut.
They had to drop production.
So production
falls from the 70s into the 80s.
In the 90s it starts to climb again.
And this has to do with PDVSA,
the Venezuelan national oil company.
For a long time, PDVSA was kind of unique
when it comes to national oil companies.
You know,
we talk about Aramco and Saudi Arabia,
the Iraqi Petroleum company,
the Kuwaiti Petroleum company.
Almost every, big oil producer
in the world has a national oil company.
Venezuela's
PDVSA for a long time was run like a,
capitalist enterprise.
It was
run on the basis of securing profit.
It was, in the 90s.
It was very good at, making deals
with the international oil companies
both from the west and elsewhere.
So, in the 90s,
you know, about 30, 35 years ago,
Venezuela output starts to climb again.
And in the early 2000, it gets, close to 3
million barrels
a day, just as prices are peaking.
You know, Venezuela is making a tremendous
amount of money in the early 2000.
It's,
I think, got the, highest per capita,
income of any South American country
at the time.
It's extremely wealthy.
It's making a lot of money, incomes.
Hugo Chavez and Chavez small.
You know, this this, political ideology
built around,
a very large socialist welfare state,
lots of,
public enterprise national companies,
but also a lot of authoritarianism,
a lot of corruption, a lot of kleptocracy.
And Chavez pushes further nationalization
of the oil industry.
The oil industry
had already been nationalized.
And now we could go down
another rabbit hole
and talk about the history of resource
nationalism in Venezuela.
But the industry had been nationalized
in the 70s.
What had been done in the 90s
was, you know, more joint,
deals with international companies
bringing in international capital.
Chavez closes that door and demands
that all companies
operating in Venezuela
give PDVSA a 60% share.
He demands, much higher royalties,
much pulling much more money
out of the existing deals.
And as a result, production starts to fall
because suddenly the investment
is drying up.
International firms aren't as interested
in operating in Venezuela.
They're pulling back.
In the meantime, PDVSA is turning from
a pretty well run oil company into,
basically
a piggy bank for Chavez
and his, and his government.
When it turns over to Maduro,
it gets even worse.
There's more mismanagement,
more corruption.
Meanwhile, Venezuela's oil fields,
which are tricky to manage
given the nature of the crude,
the technical problems
that you encounter, you know,
the industry falls into disrepair
in the in the in the 2000,
the price collapses.
The oil price collapses in 2014, 2015.
This coincides with lots of protests
against the Maduro government.
You know, street uprisings,
violent repression.
Maduro is cracking down and Venezuela
oil production just tanks.
And at the same time,
the US is putting sanctions on Venezuela,
considerable sanctions in connection
to Maduro's repression.
So all of this coalesces into a story
that has its peaks, it has its valleys.
But when we get to 2025,
Venezuela is sitting
on this giant oil industry
that has fallen into disrepair.
It's producing a little bit
less than a million barrels a day.
It ostensibly has this massive reserve
of crude oil that American companies
actually have a lot of experience
with dealing with Chevron,
Exxon, the oil services
companies, smaller U.S, mid-caps.
All of them have been involved,
or many of them have been involved
in Venezuela
over the last, you know, century.
So they they know
what's at stake down there.
But they also know the risks, the costs.
And I think they're going to be very wary
of getting involved again,
particularly as the situation remains
so uncertain.
Joe, I'm going to start a rival band
called Heavy Sour Crude.
It's going to be the complete opposite of.
Music, I got to say. I don't know, pop.
Okay. No, I don't
I don't really want to do that.
But, but, I'm going to think about it,
By side project.
You could be in it.
Yeah, I could be a Spanish voice having.
A good voice, by the way.
Thank you, I really don't.
Oh, yes you do.
I've done karaoke there several times.
You a very good voice.
Okay. Off topic, Greg.
Okay, here's a basic question.
Given all the risks involved in Venezuela,
and I remember
my husband actually went to Venezuela once
when he was a teenager, and the stories
he told me were a little bit hair
raising, including as soon as he landed,
someone tried to steal his bag.
And then he remembers
going to a movie theater,
and they were selling life insurance
alongside the ticket to the movie theater.
Again, all anecdotal.
I can't exactly vouch for those,
but given the risks of operating
in Venezuela and the fact
that you do have this heavy, sour crude
that's, you know, difficult to refine,
why is one question I always wondered
why is Chevron even still there?
So I'll start by saying the oil industry,
it it has a pretty expansive approach
to time.
Things take a long time,
when you discover a field,
when it's in greenfield stage
where you drill test wells,
where you expand and explore
how big the reserve is from
that point to actually producing oil
in commercial quantities.
It can be a decade, decade plus,
particularly
if it's maybe like an offshore
field, like in Guyana or elsewhere.
Then if you're a big,
you know, relatively integrated,
vertically integrated international oil
company, you're going to have places that
you want to send that crude, you're going
to have refineries, and downstream assets
that you're going to send the crude to.
And when it comes to heavy,
sour, from Venezuela or from Canada,
refineries need to be built and optimized
to take that crude, because otherwise it's
not going to be efficient.
Your refinery utilization
isn't going to be where you want it to be.
Your margins are going to be tighter.
So Chevron spent a long time
developing their position in Venezuela,
which from various points of view
does go back,
I think to the I think to
the 1940s is where Chevron first began,
to expand its operations
in the western basin, the Maracaibo basin.
They've built refineries
in the US Gulf Coast
that are optimized
to take Venezuelan crude.
So the
cost,
the sunken cost for them is considerable.
And that's where it kind of
always comes down to. Right.
Other IOCs were willing to pull out of
Venezuela, cut their losses, go elsewhere.
Chevron was it.
And part of that was due
to how much money they had spent.
Part of that was due to their success
at convincing the US government
to allow them to remain right,
granting them sanctions waivers,
granting them special licenses
to continue to operate.
At the same time,
they were able to leverage their position
with the Venezuelan government
and say, you need us.
You need us to stay, because at some point
things are going to get better
and you are going to get, increased
international interest and investments.
And we were here first.
And, you know, we we want to maintain
this privileged position.
So all of that has combined
to keep Chevron
in Venezuela when other companies
were willing to pull back.
And there's already been,
I think, a response from Chevron
following the Maduro, operation.
They're talking about
sending their their teams back in.
They're talking about expanding their,
their profile there.
They're still very conscious
of the security risks
and the risks to personnel that exist,
but they want to hold on to what they have
and they want to expand it.
And, you know, considering the costs,
putting that to one side,
Venezuela is still geographically
a very attractive place to operate
if you have lots of U.S downstream assets,
if you have refineries in the Gulf Coast
and you want to get heavy
sour crude to them,
Venezuela is a great place
to get that crude.
Well, give us your read.
On the political situation,
I guess because there is
I mean, I don't know exactly
what the sort of political science
definition of the term regime change is.
We went in and took out the president,
but the party has it looks like,
at least for now, his vice
president, Elsie Rodriguez, is assumed,
at least on an interim basis,
the presidency.
There's no I mean,
I thought it was really remarkable.
Trump didn't even sort of like,
make a nod to like,
oh, the democratically elected leader
in exile or whatever.
And yet,
the administration seems cool with, like,
his people still being there.
And as you just mentioned,
the company is like, all right,
we're already ready to send people back in
to get back to work.
Just like I assume everything's so fluid,
I suppose.
But what's your read on?
Like the sort of short to medium
political situation now in Venezuela.
So I think it's it's become very clear
that from the U.S.
point of view,
getting Maduro out was the goal.
Yeah.
You know, overtaking the government.
Knocking the government down, having it
replaced by a completely new power
apparatus, completely new regime
bringing in the opposition,
the Democratic opposition,
that I don't think was ever on the cards.
This was about removing Maduro.
And and I think, you know,
you could make the argument
that some of it was personal
for President Trump.
He didn't like Maduro.
Maduro had been, driving a hard bargain
because they've been negotiating
for months about what the U.S.
can get from Venezuela
and what kinds of concessions
that Maduro could offer and Trump
US apparently lost his patience
and decided to do something pretty risky.
But it turns,
it turns out, was was very successful.
The government that Maduro led,
which incidentally,
he inherited from Hugo
Chavez, is still there.
It's led by Delta Rodriguez and others.
It still controls the military.
It still manages most of the country.
Parts of the country
are slightly out of its control on are run
by essentially drug cartels
and militias further further inland.
But the capital, the major cities,
the oil fields are still under control
of the government
that used to be led by Maduro.
What happens next,
I think, depends on what kind of,
modus vivendi is reached
between Washington and Caracas.
And some of that comes down to what it is
that Trump actually wants out of this.
I think the first goal
was demonstrating U.S.
power, and I think they've done that,
signaling to, the rest of the world,
but particularly the Western Hemisphere,
that the US is now willing to use its
power, much more assertively
and aggressively than it has in the past.
But that's not much.
You know, what else could the US gain
from having done this?
And obviously now it's all talk
about gaining access to the oil reserves
and bringing in U.S.
companies, but that's going to be very,
very difficult to do.
So I think in the short term,
the first thing that Caracas is going
to want to see from the US is lifting
the oil blockade
and allowing tankers to move.
Most of those tankers
are going to want to go to China
because that's who's been taking
most of Venezuelan oil.
That might not be too difficult
for Trump to accept, because Trump
also wants to reach, modus
vivendi with Beijing.
He wants to have a better relationship
with Jinping.
That's also something
that the administration
has been trying to prioritize.
But this this political situation
in Venezuela,
absent Maduro,
doesn't appear to have changed at all.
The regime is still
there. It's not regime change.
It isn't even regime decapitation,
because Maduro
was replaceable and they filled his shoes
with somebody else.
And the administration
seems perfectly fine with that.
What kind of chatter are
you actually hearing from the oil majors,
setting Chevron aside,
what would it take to get like at Exxon?
Who I understand is still owed money
by the Venezuelan government,
back into the country.
What are they looking for?
So I think you can think of it in stages.
So the first would be lifting
the blockade. They would have to see that.
They would have to see the U.S.
saying
publicly, Venezuela can export oil again,
because no one's going to want to go in
and spend money in Venezuela
if they can't be guaranteed access to
to foreign markets.
Right.
I think the US has been trying to signal
that the blockade
is about stopping sanction tankers,
but it's been,
it's been indiscriminate in the sense
that it hasn't
been specifically connected to what the US
is clearly trying to do in Venezuela,
which is, you know, remove Maduro
and exert more pressure on the government.
So the blockade would have to be lifted
and then sanctions
would have to be lifted.
Right. Venezuela
remains under heavy sanction.
The Maduro government remains
under sanction,
and international oil
companies, Western companies
aren't going to want to go into a country
where they're exposed to sanctions risk.
They're just not going to be interested
even if the price were to go up.
And even if, the, the, the numbers started
to make a little bit more sense,
that's still too
great of a risk, to take on at this time.
The price coming up
would also have to happen.
Yeah. Right.
The current market condition
just doesn't justify
spending billions of dollars
developing fields.
When, the price is at $60
a barrel, it's likely to fall even more.
Yeah.
If you look at, like, the new rig chart.
Right.
It's going down
even in the U.S at $60 a barrel.
I can't imagine that people are like,
well,
now we'll just open some facilities
in Venezuela.
Exactly.
And yeah, compare it to I mean, again,
we bring it up a couple of times, but
Guyana Next Door has been a tremendously
profitable place for Exxon to operate.
The U.S onshore is still very attractive.
It's safe.
You know, there's
they're you're not going to have,
Delta Force coming in and pulling off
covert operations in the Permian or,
you know, in North Dakota.
You know, no one's going
to have to worry about that.
So if you've got capital
and you want to find somewhere to invest
it, there are better places to do so.
Yeah.
And in Venezuela, add to all that,
you know, the infrastructural
problems, the technical problems,
the heavy sour being,
it needs to go through upgraders,
it needs to be passed through diluent.
It needs to be treated
in a certain way for it even to be viable.
Right.
There's a lot of money and a lot of time,
a lot of effort that would have to go in
on top of all the geopolitical risks and
the uncertainty and the market conditions.
Talk to us more about,
Guyana.
And, because the first time we had you on,
I think that's what we, talked about
and how much oil they have there.
But I know that the Venezuelan government
had claimed
at least some part
or all of their oil was actually theirs.
Was there ever any legitimacy to this,
to tell us about the backstory there
and whether there's any
whether this changes anything with that?
Well, I think, you know, upshot
is we're probably not going to hear
any more from Venezuela about threatening
Guyana, given the tenuous position
of the Delsey Rodriguez government.
If it lasts, I think they're going to want
to make friends, rather than enemies.
Even though there was some pretty,
you know, boisterous rhetoric initially,
now the attitude seems to be much more
we want to work with the U.S,
we want sanctions relief.
We want to lift the blockade.
Pulling back from threatening
Guyana is going to be a part of that.
The historical claim, you know,
like South America, territorial disputes
are actually pretty wide ranging.
Everybody seems to have
a claim on everybody else,
if they want to dredge
them up,
which the Maduro government decided to do,
you know, last year and the year before,
I don't think anybody took them seriously.
Guyana is not in a position
to defend itself,
unfortunately, it's a very small country.
But at the same time, I think they were
confident that the US would back them up.
China is also, involved
in the Guyana offshore developments
through Chinese national oil companies.
They hold a minority share.
And at the same time, Brazil,
was willing to back up Guyana and was
was pushing back very hard on Venezuela
when Maduro was making those claims.
So the territorial claim is historical,
but there's not a whole lot to it.
I don't think now that Maduro has gone,
I don't think
we're going to hear much more about it,
but it's still going to sort of float
in the ether.
The other point that I would make is,
you know, the market, as you noted,
didn't care too much
when this happened, right?
Oil prices didn't really change.
The whole attitude to this drama
with the blockade and everything like
it hasn't really affected prices.
Part of that
is because there really wasn't a sense
that there was much risk to other sources.
But Guyana is right there.
And were things to get really bad.
Venezuela internal instability,
continuation of the blockade.
The US could threaten to seize assets
if it wanted to exert
even more leverage over Caracas.
That would increase the risk of escalation
to affect
neighboring oil producing countries.
With Guyana being first on the list.
Can I ask a very basic question,
which is, given all the hurdles
that we've talked about
to developing Venezuela's oil industry,
and the vast amounts of capital and time
that this will seem to need to take.
Is this really about oil?
I don't think so.
But I think for the president,
it might be.
Explained.
Let me unpack that.
So, President, President Donald Trump
does seem to think about oil a lot.
He talks about it
a lot, and always has done.
I mean, this is
you can go back and see his public record.
He's someone who's been in the public eye
for decades,
and he talks about gasoline and oil
quite a lot.
It seems to be quite central
to his view of the world,
the global economy and domestic politics.
And I think to some extent,
his viewpoint is kind of locked
in the 1980s, maybe the early 1990s.
He sees oil as being sensitive,
to geopolitical action.
He sees it as being a resource
that is coveted,
that is important
to have in large quantities.
And he sees the price as being crucial.
You have to keep the price of oil low.
So you need, as much oil on the market
as you can,
so that gasoline prices don't go up.
That view is a little outdated
at this point,
particularly from the point of view
of the United States.
The US is now the world's
largest oil producer.
It produces more oil
than any nation has done in history
and is likely to remain
so for the foreseeable future.
The US doesn't import nearly as much crude
as it used to,
or so most of its crude imports
now come from relatively safe
places, Canada being first among them.
Putting aside the any risk of,
you know, disruption of the US, Canada
bilateral relationship,
the US can get a lot of its crude
from very safe, secure places.
It doesn't need oil from Venezuela.
And quite frankly,
neither does anybody else.
There's
quite a lot of supply sloshing around.
There's available supply
from other sources
that are cheaper that are safer,
that are more competitive.
So framing this as a move to seize
oil has always been a little bit hard
for me to accept, except
from the point of view of the president.
Specifically, what does the US want?
Yeah, the official mind
of the United States, right.
As a as a policymaking, bureaucracy
as, as a, as a great power.
I think this was first and foremost
about demonstrating US primacy
in the Western Hemisphere.
You know,
I do think there is a brain trust now
that sees a resurgent Monroe Doctrine
or Don Rowe Doctrine,
when you want to call it
as being a priority,
you know that the US should shift
its viewpoint away from places
like Europe in the Middle East,
and should concentrate its attention
on the Western Hemisphere and doing this,
putting a lot of pressure on a state
that has been a US adversary.
Putting aside
the fact that it's an oil producer,
you know, Venezuela
has been kind of anti-US for a long time,
putting a lot of pressure on this state,
erecting an oil blockade,
putting a bounty
on the head of its president,
and then flying in Delta Force to kidnap
the president, take him out and put him on
trial in the US, sends a very strong
signal to everyone that the US
is now going to be exercising its primacy
in a much more aggressive way.
And I think for the for for Trump, I think
there's an allure in making this about,
you know,
materials and making it about energy
and making it about energy security.
But at the end of the day,
as we've been saying,
I don't think companies are going to
get interested or involved anytime soon.
And gasoline prices
are going to remain low for reasons
that have nothing to do
with what the US is doing in Venezuela.
Eric Levitz,
who worked for Vox, had a good two years,
like when we were younger.
You know, we do these wars and people,
they would say, this is about democracy.
And people say,
no, this is really about oil.
This is like the first time or something.
So this is about oil.
It's like,
actually we don't really believe
this is about like some it's
it's just very it's very surreal.
As a,
you know,
you work for a geopolitical analyst shop.
What's the buzz?
What is the thinking on Greenland now,
in the wake of this?
Because, like, what, one thing that we've
discovered is that just sort of like,
if there's one thing that the events
of the past week have shown
is that extraordinary unilateral actions
of any sort suddenly on the table.
And so, look, if we could just go in
and statue of Foreign Leader, then
who knows, maybe one day we'll land over
Greenland and say, this is all ours.
Do you have like, odds of any sort of
Greenland event happening in 2026
that would shock us
and maybe a different era.
I don't think I have personal odds on it.
I will say, you know that
now that the US has done this,
everybody is thinking about what
Trump might do next.
Yeah.
And that gives that gives the US
more leverage than it had a week ago.
That puts that puts the administration
in a position to say like
maybe we will, do something with Cuba.
Maybe we will do something with Colombia,
maybe we will push the Danes
to give us more access to Greenland, to
give us more rights,
to allow us to erect more bases.
Or we could just annex Greenland directly,
you know, see,
see what you're going to do about that.
I think now that there's
so much uncertainty about how the US
is going to use its power, that creates
space for the US to make all kinds
of new demands and get new concessions.
Even if, you know, actually annexing
Greenland is really not on the cards.
You know, it's it's
I don't think it's something
that the administration wants to do,
but it likes to threaten it.
Yeah.
The, the the official like TikTok
of how this went down as far as I know
like hasn't really been reported anywhere
but it it's hard to observe a story
in which you snatch a foreign leader
without suffering
any casualties of your own,
and not assume that there were quite
a few people
on the inside that knew this was coming,
that had a de facto flipped, etc.
every leader in our neighborhood
who had some sort of,
you know, tension with Trump
must be terrified.
Like, presumably they're all paranoid
about who in their inner circle
is really with them.
I think I think they have to be,
I also think there's
a kind of an underreported element here.
Okay. Reported story.
And that's the technical
like the technological side of it, right?
The US didn't just send
in special operations teams
and didn't just liaise with insiders
within the Maduro government,
to, you know, facilitate his removal,
although they almost certainly did,
they were almost
certainly were members of Materials
Inner Circle who collaborated
and facilitated this removal.
US aircraft
jammed Venezuelan communications,
Venezuelan air defenses were either
destroyed, preemptively by,
US aircraft
or they were knocked out through cyber.
Means the US reportedly used
suicide drones for the first time.
Which is something
we're going to hear more about
because this is an administration
that's interested in using
drones more aggressively.
Trump bragged that they
knocked power out in Caracas
using cyber tool.
I mean, it's it's not just the intent
that the administration has.
It's the capabilities.
Right?
The U.S, we always talk about the US
being a global superpower.
It is it's one of the only countries
in the world that can do this.
And if it wants to start doing it more,
it's a risk that states around
the world are going to have to take
into consideration.
There's also the element
of what we don't know.
We don't know all the capabilities
that the US military has at its disposal,
be it cyber, be it asymmetric, be it,
you know, kinetic operations,
nobody really we still don't have a fully,
formed picture of what the F-35 can do
against
older generations of air
defenses, older generations of aircraft.
This opens up the aperture of,
you know, what's,
21st century warfare looks like,
and that's creating even more uncertainty
and even more concern.
Days into the new year.
And we're already talking about suicide
drones. Joe.
Yeah,
I know it's going to be an insane year.
I realize one thing we haven't mentioned
in this entire conversation, I think, and
that's probably a sign of the times, is
we haven't talked about OPEC at all.
And this was the other thing
that happened over
the weekend was there was an OPEC meeting
where they talked about pausing
or continuing to pause their,
production quotas
because of the low oil price.
Does OPEC matter anymore?
And have you gotten any sense of like what
the major OPEC OPEC
players are actually thinking
about this Venezuela action?
Well, first I would say,
you know, Venezuela is a marginal member
of OPEC at this point,
given how low its production has fallen.
It's excuse from production
cuts and production quotas
because it's under sanction.
Incidentally,
Iran is in the same position as is Libya.
Venezuela doesn't produce very much.
Really.
OPEC is the GCC plus Russia at this point
through the OPEC plus alliance.
Those are really the members that matter.
And they do matter.
I mean, what OPEC has done
over the last year,
progressively pulling back production
cuts, putting more crude on the market,
signaling that they're going to produce
more, even with prices falling.
That's a pretty deliberate strategy
coming after years of trying
to manage markets by cutting production,
they've now signaled that they're okay
with prices falling,
as long as they're able to retake market
share
and also reduce the amount
of spare capacity that's hanging over.
I mean, in the last year, or in 2024,
there was maybe three,
maybe 4 million barrels of spare capacity
that was just hanging over the market.
And that's going to put a pretty, firm
ceiling on prices
when you have that much spare crude
just lying on the sidelines.
OPEC is trying to unwind that.
They're they're comfortable
with prices falling,
I think in 2026
maybe as low as, you know, in the 50s.
Per barrel for Brant.
It's already in the 50s here in the US.
The WTI price but OPEC is looking ahead.
They're looking into 2027 2028.
And they reckon that by that point
they'll be coming out in a stronger market
position.
They'll have squeezed their competitors,
including their competitors in the US,
and they'll have a bigger chunk
of the market and less spare capacity.
That will put a ceiling on prices.
And they reckon,
you know, we'll have $50 crude in 2026
and then 80, maybe even $90 crude
2028, 2029, 2030.
Needless to say, they don't see demand
peaking anytime soon.
They reckon the market's going to continue
to grow, maybe a little bit
more slowly than it has in the past,
but it's not going to start declining,
due to the energy transition
or any other factor.
That's the bet that OPEC is making.
So does this, event mean
anything significant
to some of Venezuela's
or Maduro's friends?
You know, Iran, China?
Russia, etc.?
Like, as you know, as obviously
it seems like to, you know, China,
they'll be able to
they can get oil from other places, etc.
but like,
is there any real significance to that
or will they just sort of
like sort of ideological friends?
Are there any real stakes for them?
So I I'll start with the Chinese.
And one thing that got buried a little bit
was that the
there was a Chinese delegation in Caracas.
Yeah. Yeah.
Like the day before that was.
Was so crazy for them.
And you know, if you're China, if you're
XI Jinping, and you are in the midst
of a sort of soft rapprochement
with the United States, right.
Trump is going to go to China.
They're going to meet in 2026.
There's going to be sideline meetings.
They're trying to manage
their relationship.
Trump wants a deal.
And all of that.
They don't want a confrontation.
If you're in that position
and you send a delegation to Venezuela,
and then suddenly the US flies in Delta
Force and kidnaps the president
and they don't tell you beforehand,
that's going to be alarming.
The Chinese put out a statement where they
they expressed their alarm
in very explicit terms,
regarding this action,
I don't think it was necessarily
that they love Maduro and they were,
you know, mad
that the US came in and took him.
I think they were more mad that the US
didn't tell them in advance that this was
going to happen.
But on the oil side, yeah,
China can get their crude
from from other sources, including Iran.
You know, as as Joe,
you probably well know and Tracy as well.
I also cover Iran. Yeah. Racial groups.
So I, I spent a lot of time
thinking about Iran.
And the Iranians are terrified right now.
They're extremely paranoid, that the US
because Trump's also been tweeting
about the protests that are happening.
He's been saying,
you know, the US is going to get involved.
The Iranians have been very worried that
the Israelis are going to bomb them again.
They're they're extremely concerned
about that.
There's their economy is doing
very poorly.
They're extremely worried that,
you know, after doing Maduro,
the US is going to turn on them.
So they're they're signaling
that they could do something.
There's they're warning
that they could attack preemptively.
Tensions are rising in that quarter, on
Russia, I don't think Putin is concerned.
Venezuela was kind of a soft partner
for Russia.
They had dealings. They had, relations.
There has been,
I think, a certain amount of outreach
from Moscow to Caracas
towards the Delsey Rodriguez government.
So they want to retain
their relationship there.
But I don't think they're shedding many
tears about Maduro being being swept away.
I also don't think Putin is worried
that the US
is going to try to do the same to him.
Can you put a sort of percentage
likelihood on some sort of US
action on Iran in the next,
I don't know, month?
Let's say
I would say
low in the next month, below 50%.
Public action.
I don't think the US is going to start,
you know, bombing Iran or sending troops
in or anything like that.
For a couple of reasons.
One, I don't think Trump is interested
in getting that directly involved.
I think he threatens it.
But I think there's still, a wariness
of putting boots on the ground anywhere.
The protests in Iran are very violent.
They, are a clear demonstration
of internal dissatisfaction
and dissent towards the government.
They're also fairly small,
and they've been they've triggered
a quite, active response from Iran's,
police and internal security services.
So they they don't
it's it's not in the realm of, say,
like Egypt in the, in the Arab Spring,
where you had hundreds
of thousands of protesters,
you know, coming out, putting huge
amount of pressure on a government,
and facility and also,
you know, turning the military, right.
The Egyptian military switched sides.
We're not even close to that in Iran.
And I don't think Trump wants to get
pulled into a potential quagmire
doing stuff covertly.
Is another matter.
And that's
where the Israelis really come into play.
Israel has a lot of capabilities inside
Iran, more so than the US.
They're capable of doing a lot.
At the same time,
the Israelis have retained a posture
where they say, if if Iran tries
to rebuild their nuclear program
and if they continue to build missiles,
we will strike.
We will take action, because those are
the concerns that we have.
And the Iranians are continuing to build
missiles, and they are now today, January
6th, threatening to attack preemptively
if the pressure continues to build.
The tensions are getting very,
very high there.
I don't think the US
is going to get directly involved,
but the possibility
of more Israeli action in the next month,
is, is is certainly there.
And I would say almost certainly
in the first half of 2026, I think
we're going to see new, strikes
by Israel on.
Iran, just since we're throwing out
random countries and sort of testing your,
tell us about Cuba.
What does this mean for Cuba?
So I think
I think Cuba is very much on the menu.
So to speak.
I think we're going to hear more
about Cuba
now that they have done
what they want to do in Venezuela.
Obviously, Secretary of State
Marco Rubio has a long running, interest
in, if not toppling the government
in Havana, then putting a great deal
more pressure on Havana.
Venezuela was a partner of Cuba.
A Venezuela
was the main source of crude oil.
So Venezuela
being another element of the US posture
towards the new government in Caracas,
is going to be to pull them away
from Cuba, to isolate Cuba
even more in the Western Hemisphere.
I don't think military action
is likely in the near term,
because they still have a lot of work
to do with Venezuela.
And, moving on very quickly,
to another large country,
it's going to be difficult for them.
But I do think it's going to enter
into U.S.
policy moving forward.
Joe, I watched The Godfather
two over Christmas,
and now I consider myself
a Cuban history expert.
I need to rewatch Godfather two.
Greg Brew thank you so much.
You really were the perfect guest.
I do feel like we could just
throw random questions out about anything,
geopolitics or energy for you,
and you would have an answer.
So we'll have to have you back on again
soon.
And just, more lightning round stuff.
But really appreciate you coming on Odd Lots.
Absolutely.
Thank you so much for having me.
Back, Godfather. 1 or 2, Greg two.
Oh, interesting.
DeNiro.
Yeah. De Niro.
Yeah, I got it. Greg is so good. I love.
So good. Yeah.
And he brings that historical perspective.
Yeah he's great in which
I think you need for something like this,
which isn't just a market story.
It's very much a geopolitical story.
No, it's really
you know, there was a quote
I might write about it
in the newsletter today.
There was a quote recently from,
President Trump about rare earths.
He's like rare earths, really
aren't that rare, which is true.
And it's one of those things that we talk
about, like people like to say.
But what's rare is the infrastructure
to refine them and actually get anything
commercial with it. Right.
That actually is scarce.
And I feel like this is the thing
that always gets missed.
And a lot of these oil
conversation, like, $300 billion of oil
is totally meaningless
if you don't have the all the aspects
in place to actually produce it at scale,
produce it economically.
And so I'm not surprised,
I guess, that from the perspective of
like the oil market
that trades day to day,
it seems like at minimum
it's going to be years before this oil
like to the extent that there's
some change actually moves the market.
Right.
And again, I know the oil industry does
work on long timeframes,
but when you have oil at $60
a barrel on Brant Lower on WTI, I,
it seems really hard to make the case
that like
we should go in
and spend billions in Venezuela
when they're not even starting
rigs in the US.
The other thing I saw, you know,
the headlines are flying thick
and fast on this particular story.
And I guess we should just mention that
we're we're recording this on January 6th.
But, you know, Trump just said that
maybe they could use public money
to encourage oil companies
to invest in Venezuela, US oil companies.
And that seems a hard sell to me as well.
How do you think the guys in Midland
are going to take that?
We're going to use public money to expand
supply and depress prices further.
Yeah. Hard sell, putting it mildly.
By the way,
have you watched land Man the show?
No, but I've, I've heard.
No, it's so good. Really.
Yeah I started well it's so good.
You got to I so yeah,
it makes me want to do a lot more,
episodes about independent oil producers.
I'll watch it. You got to watch it.
All right. Shall we leave it
