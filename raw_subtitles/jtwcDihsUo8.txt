From
 the
 [music]
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's


the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.


Today's
 Tuesday,
 December
 23rd.
 Here's


what
 we're
 covering.


>> If
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 Greenland,
 you


look
 up
 and
 down
 the
 coast,
 you
 have


Russian
 and
 Chinese
 ships
 all
 over
 the


place.
 We
 need
 it
 for
 national
 security.


We
 have
 to
 have
 it.
 President
 Trump
 is


renewing
 his
 calls
 for
 the
 US
 to
 take


over
 Greenland,
 which
 is
 a


semi-autonomous
 territory
 of
 Denmark.


>> Greenland's
 a
 big
 deal.


>> Yeah.


>> This
 week,
 he
 appointed
 a
 special
 envoy


to
 the
 island,
 something
 he's
 only
 done


for
 a
 short
 list
 of
 foreign
 policy


priorities
 like
 Ukraine
 and
 the
 Middle


East.
 He's
 picked
 the
 governor
 of


Louisiana,
 Jeff
 Landry,
 for
 the


position.
 After
 the
 announcement,
 Landry


thanked
 Trump
 on
 social
 media,
 writing,


"It's
 an
 honor
 to
 serve
 you
 in
 this


volunteer
 position
 to
 make
 Greenland
 a


part
 of
 the
 US."
 Officials
 in
 both


Greenland
 and
 Denmark
 are
 furious.
 Their


prime
 ministers
 put
 out
 a
 joint


statement
 saying,
 "You
 cannot
 annex


other
 countries,
 not
 even
 by
 invoking


international
 security.
 Greenland


belongs
 to
 the
 Greenlanders."
 A
 poll


earlier
 this
 year
 showed
 that
 at least


85%
 of
 residents
 there
 opposed
 the
 idea


of
 being
 absorbed
 into
 the
 US.
 After
 the


envoy
 was
 announced,
 Denmark's
 foreign


minister
 said
 he
 would
 summon
 the


American
 ambassador
 in
 Copenhagen
 for
 an


explanation.
 He
 already
 summoned
 other


American
 diplomats
 earlier
 this
 year


over
 reports
 that
 the
 US
 was
 spying
 on


the
 island.
 Most
 of
 Greenland
 is
 within


the
 Arctic
 Circle
 where
 world
 powers
 are


competing
 for
 control
 of
 shipping


corridors
 and
 untapped
 natural


resources.
 Though
 yesterday,
 Trump


denied
 oil
 and
 minerals
 were
 driving
 his


decision.


Meanwhile,
 in
 another
 diplomatic


shakeup,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 has


ordered
 nearly
 30
 ambassadors
 around
 the


world
 to
 leave
 their
 posts
 and
 return
 to


the
 US
 within
 weeks.
 A
 move
 that
 would


leave
 a
 large
 gap
 in
 the
 American


diplomatic
 corps.
 [music]
 They
 are
 all


foreign
 service
 officers
 who
 had
 been


appointed
 by
 the
 Biden
 administration


and
 confirmed
 by
 the
 Senate.
 [music]
 A


union
 representing
 career
 diplomats
 said


this
 is
 the
 first
 time
 there's
 ever
 been


a
 mass
 recall
 of
 this
 kind.
 The
 Trump


administration
 did
 not
 publicly
 announce


the
 move
 or
 give
 a
 reason
 for
 it.


[music]
 In
 response
 to
 questions
 from


the
 times,
 the
 State
 Department
 said
 it


is
 the
 president's
 right
 to
 ensure
 that


he
 has
 individuals
 in
 these
 countries


who
 advance
 the
 America
 First
 agenda.


Now,
 two
 more
 quick
 updates
 on
 the


administration.
 The
 Department
 of
 the


Interior
 says
 it's
 pausing
 leases
 for


five
 wind
 farms
 under
 construction
 off


the
 East
 Coast.
 The
 move
 effectively


guts
 the
 offshore
 wind
 industry
 in
 the


US.
 The
 Interior
 Department
 said


classified
 reports
 from
 the
 Pentagon


found
 the
 farms
 posed
 national
 security


risks
 and
 that
 the
 energy
 department
 had


found
 they
 could
 interfere
 with
 radar


systems.
 The
 decision
 has
 caused
 a
 lot


of
 chaos
 and
 uncertainty
 for
 the


companies
 that
 have
 sunk
 billions
 of


dollars
 into
 the
 renewable
 energy


projects,
 including
 one
 farm
 off
 the


coast
 of
 Virginia,
 where
 the
 company


said
 it
 had
 coordinated
 with
 the


military.
 President
 Trump
 has
 been
 a


vocal
 critic
 of
 wind
 turbines
 for
 over
 a


decade,
 calling
 them
 ugly,
 costly,
 and


inefficient,
 ever
 since
 a
 wind
 farm
 went


up
 near
 one
 of
 his
 golf
 courses
 in


Scotland.
 And
 last
 update,


>> the
 future
 Trump
 class
 battleship,
 the


USS
 Defiant,
 will
 be
 the
 largest,


deadliest,
 and
 most
 versatile,
 and
 best


looking
 warship
 anywhere
 on
 the
 world's


oceans.
 The
 Secretary
 of
 the
 Navy
 joined


the
 president
 at
 Mara
 Lago
 yesterday
 to


announce
 the
 construction
 of
 what
 will


be
 called
 a
 new
 Trump
 class
 of
 warships.


Trump
 has
 described
 the
 Navy's
 current


fleet
 as
 old
 and
 tired.
 The
 new
 ships


are
 expected
 to
 be
 the
 centerpiece
 of


his
 administration's
 effort
 to
 deter


other
 naval
 powers
 like
 China
 [music]


and
 to
 revitalize
 ship
 building
 in
 the


US.
 The
 Trump
 class
 ships
 add
 to
 the


president's
 pattern
 of
 putting
 his
 brand


on
 various
 aspects
 of
 the
 government.


Just
 last
 week,
 his
 name
 was
 added
 to


the
 Kennedy
 Center.
 One
 lawmaker
 has
 now


sued
 to
 remove
 that,
 saying
 only


Congress
 is
 authorized
 to
 make
 that
 kind


of
 change.


GLP1
 weight
 loss
 drugs
 have
 been


blockbuster
 hits
 in
 recent
 years
 with


Ozmpic
 and
 Waggoi
 becoming
 household


names.
 And
 now
 the
 Food
 and
 Drug


Administration
 has
 approved
 a
 pill


version
 of
 WGOI,
 which
 could
 lead
 more


people
 to
 consider
 taking
 it.
 Currently,


almost
 all
 GLP-1
 drugs
 are
 injectable,


which
 can
 be
 a
 hurdle
 for
 patients
 who


are
 uncomfortable
 with
 or
 afraid
 of


needles.
 But
 a
 clinical
 trial
 sponsored


by
 Novon
 Nordisk,
 the
 company
 that
 makes


WGO,
 found
 the
 pill
 version
 was
 roughly


as
 effective
 as
 the
 shot.
 The
 drug
 maker


says
 it
 will
 be
 available
 in
 the
 US


early
 next
 year.
 It
 remains
 to
 be
 seen


if
 realworld
 results
 will
 match
 those


from
 the
 trial,
 but
 more
 pill
 options


seem
 to
 be
 coming.
 Eli
 Liy,
 the
 company


that
 makes
 competitor
 weight
 loss
 drugs


like
 Zepbound
 and
 MARO,
 is
 expected
 to


release
 its
 own
 pill
 in
 the
 spring.


[music]


In
 a
 stunning
 move,
 the
 US's
 largest


maker
 of
 bourbon,
 Jim
 Beam,
 announced
 it


will
 pause
 production
 for
 one
 year
 at


its
 flagship
 facility
 in
 Kentucky.
 It's


the
 latest
 sign
 of
 distress
 for
 the


wine,
 beer,
 and
 liquor
 sector.
 There


have
 been
 production
 cuts,
 layoffs,
 and


financial
 crises
 at
 multiple
 companies


as
 sales
 have
 dropped
 about
 5%
 over
 the


past
 year.
 The
 sudden
 steep
 decline


comes
 after
 American
 whiskey
 in


particular
 had
 been
 growing,
 growing,


growing
 for
 more
 than
 20
 years.
 It
 got


an
 extra
 boost
 during
 the
 pandemic.


People
 stuck
 at
 home
 got
 into
 buying
 and


collecting,
 pouring
 money
 into
 the


market.
 Distilleries
 jumped
 to
 keep
 up


with
 demand,
 setting
 aside
 millions
 of


barrels
 to
 age.
 Industry
 experts
 say


some
 kind
 of
 market
 correction
 was


inevitable
 then
 as
 the
 pandemic
 buying


spree
 passed.
 Analysts
 say
 tariffs
 and


their
 backlash
 have
 also
 played
 a
 role.


Sales
 of
 American
 whiskey
 to
 Canada,


which
 was
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


international
 markets
 for
 it,
 have


virtually
 stopped.
 And
 consumer
 behavior


has
 been
 changing.
 Gen
 Z
 is
 reaching


drinking
 age,
 but
 polls
 show
 young


people
 drink
 less.
 And
 if
 they
 do
 drink,


they're
 choosing
 expensive,
 elevated


brands
 to
 have
 sparingly.
 That's
 a


problem
 for
 Jim
 Beam,
 which
 relies
 on


sales
 of
 its
 more
 inexpensive
 options.


And
 finally,
 it's
 time
 to
 play
 America's


favorite
 jackpot
 game.
 This
 is


>> In
 the
 last
 decade
 or
 so,
 huge
 billion


dollar
 lottery
 jackpots
 have
 become
 more


common
 because
 of
 changes
 to
 games
 like


Megaillions
 and
 Powerball
 and
 because
 of


higher
 ticket
 prices.
 To
 be
 clear,
 the


odds
 are
 still
 like
 winning
 the
 lottery,


but
 the
 prizes
 have
 ticked
 up.
 The


current
 Powerball
 Prize
 just
 hit
 1.7


billion,
 making
 it
 the
 fourth
 largest


jackpot
 ever,
 and
 it
 could
 continue
 to


grow
 if
 no
 one
 wins
 in
 the
 next
 drawing


tomorrow.
 Recently,
 the
 Times
 pulled


together
 a
 look
 at
 what's
 happened
 with


those
 big
 prizes.
 Some
 states
 let
 the


winners
 stay
 anonymous,
 a
 tactic
 many


people
 took,
 which
 yes,
 smart.
 A
 lot
 of


people
 also
 took
 the
 lump
 sum,
 walking


away
 with
 checks
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 digits
 on


them.
 But
 at
 one
 point,
 the
 Times
 Upshot


column
 did
 the
 math
 and
 found
 there's


actually
 a
 lot
 of
 persuasive
 reasons
 not


to
 do
 that
 and
 to
 take
 the
 smaller


payments
 that
 can
 last
 for
 decades


instead.
 partially
 for
 potential
 tax


advantages,
 partially
 because
 [music]
 it


can
 save
 you
 from
 yourself.


Those
 are
 the
 [music]
 headlines.
 I'm


Tracy
 Mumford.
 We
 are
 off
 for
 the
 next


few
 days
 and
 the
 headlines
 will
 return


on
 Monday,
 December
 29th.
