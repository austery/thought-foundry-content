When
 you're
 talking
 about
 the
 words
 that


have
 basically
 defined
 Canadian
 politics


these
 last
 few
 years,
 pipeline
 has
 to
 be


near
 the
 top.
 And
 it's
 back
 in
 the


headlines
 big
 time
 because
 Ottawa
 just


signed
 a
 deal
 with
 Alberta
 that
 clears


the
 way
 for
 an
 oil
 pipeline
 to
 the


Pacific.
 I'm
 sure
 you
 won't
 be
 too


surprised
 to
 hear
 there
 has
 been
 some


fallout.
 BC
 isn't
 thrilled.
 West
 Coast


First
 Nations
 have
 raised
 some
 serious


concerns.
 Alberta
 separatists
 are
 making


noise
 again.
 And
 then
 there
 was
 Liberal


Minister
 Steven
 Gilbo.
 [music]


He
 resigned
 from
 cabinet
 calling
 this


deal
 the
 last
 straw.
 So
 it
 raises
 a


couple
 of
 questions.
 Could
 the
 prime


minister
 be
 handling
 [music]
 this


better?
 And
 politically,
 was
 this
 deal


actually
 a
 smart
 move
 for
 Mark
 Carney?


Then
 how
 common
 is
 it
 for
 politicians
 to


quit
 cabinet
 like
 Gilbo
 did
 or
 switch


parties
 entirely
 like
 Nova
 Scotia
 MP


Chris
 Dantramont?
 He
 left
 the
 federal


conservatives
 for
 the
 Liberals
 last


month.
 Is
 it
 hard
 now
 for
 MPs
 even
 just


to
 speak
 off
 message?
 We
 dig
 into
 what


party
 loyalty
 means
 [music]
 in
 Canadian


politics
 and
 why
 too
 much
 of
 it
 could
 be


a
 problem
 for
 democracy.
 This
 is
 the


rundown.


[music]


Prime
 Minister
 Mark
 Carney
 and
 Alberta


Premier
 Danielle
 Smith
 were
 all
 smiles


as
 they
 signed
 a
 new
 energy
 agreement


late
 last
 month.
 The
 deal
 involves
 a
 new


bumen
 pipeline
 to
 the
 BC
 coast.
 But
 not


everyone
 is
 happy.
 The
 plan
 is
 facing


questions
 and
 criticism
 from
 British


Columbia,
 First
 Nations


environmentalists,
 and
 more.
 I
 asked


Stephanie
 Levitz,
 senior
 reporter
 for


the
 Glob
 and
 Mail's
 Ottawa
 Bureau,
 about


who
 stands
 to
 gain,
 who
 stands
 to
 lose,


and
 what
 it
 will
 actually
 take
 to
 get


this
 thing
 built.


>> Stephanie,
 great
 to
 have
 you.
 How
 are


you
 doing?


>> My
 pleasure.
 I'm
 glad
 to
 be
 here.


>> I
 want
 you
 to
 help
 us
 break
 down
 this


memorandum
 of
 understanding
 for
 us.
 What


was
 actually
 agreed
 to?


>> So,
 the
 memorandum
 of
 understanding,
 you


can
 almost
 take
 it
 in
 two
 parts.
 So
 you


can
 look
 at
 it
 and
 say,
 you
 know,
 the


biggest
 part,
 the
 headline
 narrative
 was


this
 idea,
 a
 commitment
 by
 both
 sides


that
 there
 will
 be
 a
 new
 bumen
 pipeline


that
 runs
 from
 Alberta
 to
 somewhere
 on


British
 Columbia's
 north
 coast.
 And
 in


concert
 with
 that
 um
 the
 billing
 was
 you


know
 this
 pipeline
 and
 the
 potential


economic
 sorry


the
 deal
 in
 providing
 for
 a
 pipeline


also
 sought
 to
 address
 the
 obvious


environmental
 concerns
 around
 a
 pipeline


and
 the
 production
 of
 more
 oil
 the
 the


sending
 and
 shipping
 of
 more
 oil.
 And
 so


in
 tandem
 the
 province
 of
 Alberta
 also


agreed
 to
 a
 more
 stringent
 industrial


carbon
 pricing
 program.
 and
 both
 sides


said
 they're
 going
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to


build
 what
 they're
 building
 as
 the


largest
 cap
 carbon
 capture
 and
 storage


program
 in
 the
 world
 which
 would
 be
 in


northern
 Alberta.
 So
 that's
 the


headline.
 There's
 a
 secondary
 piece
 of


thisou
 which
 isn't
 getting
 as
 much


attention
 and
 probably
 because
 it's
 less


politically
 um
 complicated
 or
 you
 know


dynamic
 and
 it's
 about
 computing
 centers


for
 AI.
 It's
 about
 more
 electricity.


They're
 called
 interties
 between
 various


provinces.
 And
 sort
 of
 other
 uh
 things


that
 both
 Ottawa
 and
 Alberta
 have
 agreed


to
 work
 on
 together.
 But
 really
 the
 big


headline
 grabber,
 the
 thing
 that's


causing
 all
 sorts
 of
 political


constrnation
 is
 this
 notion
 of
 a


pipeline
 and
 what
 goes
 into
 that.


>> We'll
 obviously
 get
 to
 the
 pipeline,
 but


I
 want
 to
 you
 to
 help
 our
 viewers


understand
 uh
 this
 deal.
 Can
 you
 put
 it


in
 context
 of
 the
 sort
 of
 larger


relationship
 between
 uh
 the
 province
 of


of
 Alberta
 and
 the
 federal
 government
 in


Ottawa?


>> Sure.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,
 when
 Justin


Trudeau
 became
 prime
 minister,
 Liberal


Prime
 Minister
 in
 2015,
 and
 he
 came
 in


to
 office
 with
 a
 very


direct
 commitment
 that
 he
 was
 going
 to


do
 more
 to
 combat
 climate
 change.
 And


one
 of
 the
 ways
 the
 Trudeau
 Liberal


government
 chose
 to
 do
 that
 over
 the


years
 was
 enacting
 a
 series
 of
 laws
 uh


to
 do
 everything.
 For
 example,
 to


legislate
 a
 restriction
 on
 oil
 tanker


traffic
 off
 the
 coast
 of
 British


Columbia,
 putting
 in
 place
 measures
 like


a
 consumer
 carbon
 price,
 which
 we
 all


recall,
 an
 industrial
 carbon
 pricing


program,
 regulations
 on
 electricity,


regulations
 on
 oil
 and
 gas
 emissions.


And
 these
 were
 all
 measures
 really


designed
 to
 drive
 down
 Canada's


emissions,
 protect
 its
 environment
 in


other
 ways.
 is
 in
 the
 case
 of
 the
 oil


tanker
 ban
 with
 a
 long-term
 goal
 getting


to
 net
 zero
 carbon
 emissions
 by
 2050.


Enter
 Alberta.
 Enter
 the
 election
 of


Danielle
 Smith.
 um
 who
 you
 know
 not


unlike
 her
 predecessor
 Rachel
 Notley
 but


Alberta
 Premier
 Daniel
 Smith
 really


believed
 and
 argued
 and
 won
 government


on
 the
 idea
 that
 everything
 the
 Trudeau


Liberal
 government
 was
 doing
 was


strangling
 the
 Alberta
 economy
 to
 death.


that
 it
 was
 irresponsible
 um
 in
 some


cases
 flatout
 unconstitutional
 for
 the


government
 to
 step
 in
 like
 it
 was


stepping
 in
 because
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 sources
 of
 carbon
 emissions
 in


this
 country
 is
 the
 Alberta
 oil
 and
 gas


industry
 and
 when
 you're
 regulating
 it


when
 you're
 increasing
 the
 pricing
 when


you're
 doing
 all
 of
 these
 things
 the


industry
 recoils
 the
 industry
 contracts


it
 maybe
 it
 doesn't
 want
 to
 invest
 as


much
 it
 doesn't
 want
 to
 do
 other
 things


and
 so
 that
 has
 a
 choking
 effect
 on
 the


Alberta
 economy
 so
 that
 sort
 the
 stage


um
 where
 things
 were
 it
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 of


combat
 like
 you
 know
 arm-to-arm
 combat


between
 Alberta
 and
 Ottawa
 for
 years


then
 enter
 Mark
 Carney
 and
 Mr.
 Carney


took
 over
 from
 Justin
 Trudeau
 uh
 you


know
 in
 January
 sorry
 Mr.
 Carney
 took


over
 from
 Justin
 Trudeau
 earlier
 this


year.
 He
 promised
 a
 new
 approach
 to
 all


sorts
 of
 things.
 And
 one
 of
 them
 was,


you
 know,
 rebuilding
 relationships
 with


Alberta
 by
 trying
 to
 find
 a
 way
 to


support
 more
 development
 in
 the
 oil
 and


gas
 industry
 while
 at
 the
 same
 time


meeting
 Canada's
 climate
 goals.
 And
 I


mean,
 never
 have
 we
 probably
 seen
 in


recent
 history
 such
 a
 180
 in
 political


tone
 uh
 between
 two
 leaders.
 I
 mean,


every
 every
 provincial
 leader
 in
 this


country,
 frankly,
 was
 was
 just
 smitten


with
 Mr.
 Carney
 and
 his
 new
 approach
 to


doing
 things,
 but
 none
 more
 so
 than


Daniel
 Smith,
 who
 if
 we
 take,
 you
 know,


from
 their
 first
 meeting
 all
 the
 way


until
 when
 this
 memorandum
 of


understanding
 was
 signed
 a
 week
 ago.
 Um,


you
 know,
 they're
 basically
 besties
 at


this
 point.
 a
 role
 that
 you
 know
 uh


Ontario
 Premier
 Doug
 Ford
 always
 used
 to


say
 that
 Christopher
 Freeland
 the
 former


finance
 minister
 deputy
 prime
 minister


was
 his
 best
 friend
 was
 his
 therapist


and
 now
 feels
 like
 there's
 some
 kind
 of


romance
 going
 on
 between
 Alberta
 Premier


Daniel
 Smith
 and
 Prime
 Minister
 Mark


Carney
 because
 he
 has
 agreed
 bottom
 line


to
 get
 rid
 of
 lift
 suspend
 temporarily


adjust
 many
 of
 the
 regulations
 that
 she


said
 were
 poisonous
 to
 her
 province's


economy
 and
 therefore
 the
 national


economy


>> I
 want
 to
 actually
 talk
 about
 another


relationship
 ship
 uh
 the
 assembly
 of


first
 nation
 chiefs
 uh
 they
 had
 adopted


a
 resolution
 on
 Wednesday
 to
 uh
 withdraw


theou
 what
 is
 required
 of
 this


government
 in
 terms
 of
 indigenous


consultation
 going
 forward


>> you
 know
 it's
 tricky
 you
 know
 in
 the


justice
 system
 and
 other
 places
 you
 know


we
 often
 use
 the
 expression
 three


strikes
 and
 you're
 out
 right
 and
 I


wonder
 with
 the
 liberal
 government
 right


now
 um
 whether
 they've
 not
 hit
 two


strikes
 which
 is
 to
 say
 the
 Building


Canada
 Act,
 which
 was
 the
 thing
 that


legislatively
 lays
 the
 groundwork
 for


something
 like
 this
 major
 Alberta


pipeline,
 was
 rushed
 through
 over
 the


objections
 of
 many
 indigenous


communities
 who
 felt
 there
 wasn't


adequate
 consultation
 that
 it
 came
 it


was
 sprung
 on
 them
 out
 of
 nowhere.
 Fast


forward
 to
 this
 memorandum
 of


understanding
 which
 although
 in
 the
 text


requires
 consultation
 and
 a
 degree
 of


buyin
 from
 the
 province
 of
 British


Columbia
 from
 the
 coastal
 first
 nations


or
 any
 other
 first
 nations
 or
 indigenous


communities
 whose
 territories
 might
 be


affected
 by
 this
 project.
 It
 is
 baked


into
 theou
 but
 they
 weren't
 brought


along
 in
 a
 in
 a
 substantive
 way
 when


thisou
 was
 being
 negotiated.
 And
 so
 I


guess
 it's
 by
 happen
 stance
 that
 the


Assembly
 of
 First
 Nations
 is
 having,
 you


know,
 a
 big
 meeting
 this
 week.
 This
 is


very
 much
 on
 their
 agenda.
 And
 you
 know,


whereas
 theou
 does
 not
 I'm
 trying
 to
 to


come
 up
 with
 the
 language.
 Theou
 doesn't


lay
 out
 a
 okay,
 in
 order
 to
 get,
 you


know,
 the
 consent
 and
 approval
 of


coastal
 first
 nations
 or
 other
 First


Nations,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 do
 X,
 Y,
 Zed,


and
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 it
 over
 this


amount
 of
 time.
 It
 just
 says,
 "Yes,
 this


will
 be
 done
 in
 respect
 of
 indigenous


rights.
 Yes,
 there
 will
 be
 consultation


and
 collaboration
 with
 First
 Nations.


It's
 worth
 noting
 that
 this
 new
 pipeline


is
 also
 allegedly
 going
 to
 be
 co-owned


by
 indigenous
 communities.
 I
 don't
 know


who
 or
 when
 or
 how
 that's
 going
 to


work."
 So,
 there's
 elements
 of
 it
 built


in.
 The
 problem
 is
 is
 you
 know
 the
 horse


had
 already
 left
 the
 barn
 to
 borrow
 yet


another
 metaphor
 and
 many
 first
 nations


are
 saying
 you
 can't
 tell
 us
 how
 you're


going
 to
 consult
 us
 later
 like
 we
 should


have
 been
 at
 the
 table
 to
 draw
 this
 up


in
 the
 first
 place.


>> Another
 headline
 of
 of
 course
 is
 that


Prime
 Minister
 Mark
 Carney
 lost
 a
 a


cabinet
 minister
 over
 this.
 uh
 help
 us


understand
 what
 else
 do
 we
 know
 is


happening
 uh
 behind
 closed
 doors
 in
 the


caucus
 right
 now
 with
 with
 the
 Liberal


Party.


>> It's
 interesting,
 you
 know,
 when
 Mr.


Carney
 came
 in
 and
 his
 reputation
 and


that
 of
 some
 of
 the
 folks
 he
 brought


with
 him,
 namely
 and
 relevant
 in
 this


instance
 is
 natural
 resources
 minister


Tim
 Hodgson
 was
 that
 they
 were
 pragmatic


businessmen
 who
 just
 wanted
 to
 get
 deals


done,
 juice
 the
 economy,
 get
 things


moving
 faster.
 There
 was
 a
 lot
 of


support
 from
 that
 from
 the
 business


sector
 from
 even
 from
 within
 the
 liberal


own
 the
 liberals
 own
 caucus
 and


begrudgingly
 I
 think
 even
 from
 among


certain
 opposition
 parties.
 Fast
 forward


to
 now
 and
 we
 see
 a
 situation
 where


there
 is
 a
 tension
 and
 a
 clash
 brewing


within
 the
 liberal
 caucus
 between
 the


get
 it
 done
 get
 it
 done
 fast
 attitude
 at


the
 top
 Mr.
 Carney
 Mr.
 Hodgson
 to
 two


different
 parts
 of
 the
 Liberal
 caucus.


one
 wondering
 why
 they're
 not
 being


brought
 along
 for
 the
 ride
 and
 you
 have


a
 bunch
 of
 Liberal
 members
 of
 parliament


you
 know
 elected
 in
 British
 Columbia
 as


a
 for
 example
 in
 the
 last
 election
 who


are
 read
 into
 thisou
 quite
 late
 and
 in
 a


matter
 in
 a
 manner
 rather
 that
 many
 of


them
 say
 was
 dismissive
 rude
 arrogant


that
 they
 weren't
 being
 treated
 very


nicely
 by
 the
 center
 or
 by
 Mr.
 Hodgson.


Then
 you
 have
 the
 environmentalists


within
 this
 caucus,
 a
 significant
 enough


portion
 of
 them
 who've
 now
 banded


together
 to
 create
 their
 own


environmental
 caucus,
 something
 they


started
 at
 the
 outset
 of
 this
 parliament


over
 concerns
 that
 Mr.
 Carney's


commitment
 to
 previous
 liberal
 ambition


on
 climate
 change
 wasn't
 there.
 And
 you


know,
 as
 witnessed
 by
 the
 fact
 on
 on
 day


one,
 he
 signs
 away
 and
 and
 removes
 the


consumer
 price
 on
 carbon,
 which
 many


people
 say,
 you
 know,
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a


very
 effective
 means
 at
 bringing
 down


emissions.
 Unfortunately,
 it
 ran


headlong
 into
 an
 inflationary
 crisis
 and


cost
 of
 living
 pressures.
 But
 the
 point


is
 is
 that
 within
 the
 Liberal
 caucus


right
 now,
 I
 do
 think
 there
 are
 a


significant
 number
 of
 people
 for
 whom


Steve
 Steven
 Gilbo
 is
 is
 now
 the
 the


personification
 of
 that,
 looking
 at


their
 record,
 looking
 at
 what's
 been


done
 so
 far
 and
 wondering,
 are
 we
 really


committed
 to
 climate
 change,
 combating


climate
 change,
 and
 what
 are
 we
 going
 to


do
 about
 that?
 because
 it
 doesn't
 feel


like
 we're
 doing
 very
 much.


>> We
 have
 about
 30
 seconds
 left.
 I
 have


one
 last
 question
 for
 you.
 So
 far,
 we


have
 just
 the
 framework
 and
 uh
 Prime


Minister
 Mark
 Carney
 has
 said
 that
 the


private
 sector
 will
 need
 to
 be
 involved


for
 this
 project
 and
 pipeline
 to
 go


forward.
 That's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


he
 says,
 but
 help
 us
 understand
 what


would
 it
 actually
 take
 to
 get
 this


built.


>> I
 guess
 the
 very
 first
 important
 thing


is
 that
 someone's
 got
 to
 be
 willing
 to


build
 it.
 And
 right
 now
 while
 the


Alberta
 government
 is
 absolutely
 a


champion
 of
 this
 pipeline
 there,
 there


is
 no
 formal
 what
 is
 known
 now
 the
 word


everyone
 is
 using
 is
 proponent.
 There
 is


not
 a
 company
 coming
 forward
 and
 saying


I
 propose
 a
 pipeline.
 Here's
 how
 it's


going
 to
 be
 built.
 Here
 is
 where
 it
 is


going
 to
 go.
 Here
 is
 where
 it
 is
 going


to
 you
 know
 the
 bumenumen
 in
 it.
 It
 will


exit
 here.
 It
 can
 be
 shipped
 there.
 That


does
 not
 exist.
 This
 is
 a
 theoretical


concept
 at
 the
 moment.
 And
 so
 really
 the


next
 major
 step
 for
 this
 major
 project


will
 be
 the
 Smith
 government
 moving


ahead
 and
 actually
 submitting
 a
 proposal


for
 this
 pipeline.
 And
 that
 proposal
 has


to
 check
 a
 number
 of
 boxes
 in
 including


and
 again
 um
 collaboration
 a
 and
 a


degree
 of
 consent
 from
 the
 government
 of


British
 Columbia
 and
 absolutely
 some


degree
 of
 support
 and
 consent
 from
 the


first
 nations
 whose
 territories
 are


affected
 by
 this.


>> Stephanie,
 we
 are
 definitely
 going
 to


continue
 following
 this.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 and
 thank
 you
 for
 your
 insights.


>> My
 pleasure.
 Anytime.


>> Who
 do
 politicians
 owe
 their
 loyalty
 to?


Their
 leaders,
 their
 parties,
 or
 their


constituents?
 That's
 something
 Nova


Scotia
 MP
 Chris
 Dantter
 clearly
 had
 to


grapple
 with
 before
 crossing
 the
 floor


from
 the
 federal
 conservatives
 to
 the


Liberals
 last
 month.


>> I
 I
 didn't
 find
 I
 was
 represented
 there.


um
 that
 that
 my
 ideals
 of
 an
 eastern
 of


of
 a
 of
 a
 of
 a
 red
 Tory
 I
 mean
 quite


honestly
 of
 of
 trying
 to
 find
 ways
 to
 to


find
 solutions
 and
 and
 and
 help
 your


community
 rather
 than
 trying
 to
 oppose


everything
 that
 that
 that's
 happening.
 A


new
 book,
 No
 Eye
 in
 Team:
 Party
 Loyalty


in
 Canadian
 Politics
 says
 it's
 getting


rare
 for
 parliamentarians
 to
 break
 ranks


even
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 what
 they
 say.
 I


sat
 down
 with
 two
 of
 the
 authors,
 Alex


Marland,
 Jeruslowski,
 chair
 in
 trust
 and


political
 leadership
 at
 Acadia


University,
 and
 Jared
 J.
 Wesley,


professor
 of
 political
 science
 at
 the


University
 of
 Alberta
 to
 talk
 about
 how


party
 discipline
 is
 shaping
 democracy
 in


Canada
 and
 silencing
 disscent.


Alex
 Jared,
 great
 to
 see
 you.
 How
 are


you
 guys
 doing
 today?


>> Hey,
 great.
 This
 is
 good
 to
 be
 on
 this


program
 chatting
 with
 you.


>> Great
 to
 be
 here.


>> Alex,
 I'm
 gonna
 come
 to
 you.
 This
 book


spells
 out
 a
 system
 of
 really
 strict


party
 loyalty
 in
 Canada
 and
 I'm
 hoping


we
 can
 get
 a
 brief
 history
 here.
 How
 did


we
 get
 here?


>> Oh
 gosh.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of
 politicians


will
 tell
 you
 there's
 no
 political


parties
 in
 the
 Constitution
 of
 Canada.


These
 things
 emerged.
 And
 if
 you
 think


about
 it,
 whenever
 you're
 in
 a
 big


group,
 you
 inevitably
 are
 going
 to
 start


finding
 factions
 in
 little
 subgroups


kind
 of
 emerging.
 And
 so
 it
 makes
 sense


that
 in
 a
 legislature,
 uh,
 whether
 it's


at
 the
 federal
 level
 or
 in
 the
 provinces


for
 that
 matter,
 you're
 going
 to
 end
 up


having
 political
 parties
 emerge
 because


people
 who
 are
 like-minded
 and
 have


shared
 goals
 are
 going
 to
 want
 to
 work


together
 and
 are
 going
 to
 be
 different


than
 people
 who
 have
 uh
 different
 goals.


And
 so
 what
 happened
 is
 over
 time
 in


Canada
 we
 saw
 that
 political
 parties


started
 getting
 more
 and
 more
 in
 power


over
 time.
 Uh
 but
 really
 it's
 when
 you


saw
 changes
 in
 the
 legislature
 that


political
 parties
 had
 a
 lot
 more
 control


over
 uh
 over
 candidates
 or
 sorry
 over
 um


parliamentarians
 and
 then
 eventually


over
 candidates
 uh
 particular
 when
 party


labels
 started
 appearing
 on
 ballots
 in


the
 1970s
 federally.
 Jared,
 MPs
 are


consistent
 not
 just
 in
 how
 they
 vote,


uh,
 not
 in
 in
 how
 they
 campaign
 and
 but


also
 how
 they
 talk
 to
 media.
 How
 has


message
 discipline
 evolved
 over
 time?


>> Yeah,
 there
 I
 think
 there's
 two
 uh


trends
 that
 that
 we
 noticed
 in
 in
 our


research.
 The
 first
 is
 that
 um


like-minded
 people,
 as
 Alex
 mentioned,


start
 to
 congregate
 within
 parties,
 but


at
 the
 same
 time,
 folks
 that
 might
 have


shared
 even
 a
 slightly
 different
 opinion


are
 simply
 not
 um
 uh
 you
 know,
 offering


their
 names
 up
 uh
 as
 candidates
 or


joining
 the
 parties
 in
 the
 first
 place.


So,
 it
 becomes
 a
 a
 matter
 of
 self-


selection.
 But
 really
 things
 took
 off
 uh


with
 the
 advent
 of
 social
 media.
 As
 MPs


on
 one
 hand
 had
 uh
 you
 know
 more
 access


to
 direct
 communications
 with
 their


constituents,
 parties
 at
 the
 same
 time


realized
 the
 huge
 risk
 involved
 in
 that.


parties
 themselves
 as
 central


organizations
 wanted
 to
 drive
 one


narrative
 and
 and
 they
 needed
 to
 make


sure
 from
 a
 risks
 perspective
 that
 their


candidates
 weren't
 messaging
 something


that
 would
 either
 distract
 or
 in
 worst


case
 scenarios,
 you
 know,
 counteract


some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 they
 were
 trying


to
 say
 to
 voters.
 And
 so,
 social
 media


was
 really
 the
 time
 when
 we
 saw
 this


message
 discipline
 um
 kick
 in
 um
 into


high
 gear.


>> Can
 you
 help
 us
 understand,
 Jared,
 a


little
 bit
 of
 sort
 of
 uh
 the
 training


that
 kind
 of
 goes
 into
 this?
 like
 we


talk
 about
 the
 risks
 that
 are
 involved,


but
 what
 what
 are
 MPs
 being
 told
 when
 it


comes
 to
 message
 discipline?


>> Well,
 one
 of
 the
 key
 findings
 and


recommendations
 from
 our
 book
 is
 that
 um


MPs
 ought
 not
 just
 to
 hear
 from


political
 parties
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 their


orientation
 to
 parliament,
 right?
 most


of
 the
 introduction
 that
 they
 get
 to
 to


life
 as
 an
 MP
 or
 at
 the
 provincial
 level


as
 an
 MLA,
 M&A,
 MHA
 and
 all
 of
 the
 other


acronyms,
 most
 of
 that
 orientation
 u


beyond,
 you
 know,
 where
 the
 bathrooms


are
 and
 and
 how
 to
 hire
 um
 individuals


from
 human
 resources
 is
 coming
 from
 the


party
 and
 and
 as
 a
 result,
 these
 folks


are
 are
 being
 conditioned
 to
 think
 of


not
 just
 voting
 in
 the
 legislature,
 not


just
 drafting
 of
 li
 laws
 and
 reviewing


of
 laws,
 but
 but
 how
 they
 communicate


with
 each
 in
 the
 House
 and
 then
 how
 they


communicate
 with
 their
 constituents.
 All


of
 that
 is
 being
 conditioned
 by
 parties


training
 people
 to
 tow
 the
 party
 line.


>> All
 right,
 Alex,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 um


some
 news
 that
 made
 some
 headlines
 a
 few


weeks
 ago
 when
 MP
 Chris
 Donol
 crossed


the
 floor
 in
 November.
 It
 created
 a


media
 frenzy.
 It
 was
 a
 big
 deal.
 Why?


Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 one
 thing


that
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 floor
 crossing


event
 really
 for
 us
 was
 a
 key
 moment


because
 it
 very
 much
 is
 what
 our
 book
 is


about,
 which
 started
 as
 a
 grant
 to
 study


floor
 crossing
 in
 in
 Canada.
 And
 the


reason
 why
 this
 attracts
 so
 much


attention
 has
 there's
 there's
 a
 few
 key


variables
 that
 were
 different
 about


Chris
 Donal
 crossing
 the
 floor
 compared


to
 some
 others
 that,
 you
 know,
 don't
 get


a
 lot
 of
 attention
 or
 they
 flame
 out


after
 maybe
 a
 day
 or
 two.
 uh
 one
 was
 the


fact
 that
 at
 the
 federal
 level
 the
 uh


seat
 count
 is
 so
 close
 between
 the


Liberals
 ability
 to
 have
 a
 majority


government
 versus
 minorities.
 So
 one


vote
 can
 matter
 especially
 when
 it's


coming
 from
 the
 conservatives
 who
 are


going
 who
 are
 opposed
 to
 the
 budget


going
 over
 to
 the
 other
 side.
 Uh
 then
 of


course
 there's
 just
 simply
 the
 nature
 of


budget
 day.
 Uh
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 drama


around
 that
 particular
 day
 and
 then
 we


get
 these
 images
 of
 Chris
 Donal
 walking


into
 the
 caucus
 room
 uh
 with
 the
 prime


minister.
 And
 so
 all
 of
 these
 things


really
 combined
 for
 everybody
 to
 start


talking
 about
 this.
 And
 part
 of
 it
 is


also
 because
 this
 is
 so
 shocking.
 This


is
 seen
 as
 the
 ultimate
 treachery.
 I


mean
 we,
 you
 know,
 the
 liberals
 and
 the


conservatives
 are
 positioned
 as
 almost


mortal
 en
 enemies
 even
 though
 we
 know


that
 they
 actually
 have
 an
 awful
 lot
 in


common.


>> Jared,
 what
 does
 it
 do
 to
 our
 democracy


when
 everything
 happens
 on
 such
 a
 strict


party
 line?


Yeah,
 it
 it
 feeds
 into
 what
 political


scientists
 call
 a
 effective


polarization.
 So
 that
 that's
 not
 just


simply
 uh
 groups
 of
 people
 diverging


when
 it
 comes
 to
 policy
 solutions
 or


seeing
 themselves
 as
 being
 on
 the
 left


and
 right.
 That
 that
 has
 always


happened.
 But
 what
 it
 what
 this


hyperartisanship
 feeds
 into
 is
 a
 sense


that
 the
 folks
 on
 the
 other
 side
 are
 not


just
 uh
 adversaries
 to
 be
 defeated
 uh


during
 elections,
 but
 they're
 actually


enemies
 that
 need
 to
 be
 vanquished
 from


from
 the
 the
 field
 of
 competition


entirely.
 And
 that
 that
 enemy
 mindset,


that
 strong
 uh
 outgroup
 uh
 animosity


creates
 a
 situation
 where
 folks
 that
 are


within
 parties
 are
 more
 willing
 to


forgive
 their
 leaders
 for
 any
 kind
 of
 of


democratic
 sins
 and
 misgivings
 if
 it


means
 keeping
 the
 other
 side
 out
 of


power.
 And
 so
 we've
 seen
 some
 of
 that
 on


display
 particularly
 here
 in
 Alberta


lately
 where
 um
 you
 know
 the
 United


Conservatives
 have
 been
 uh
 I
 would
 say


stretching
 the
 bounds
 of
 of
 liberal


democracy
 with
 some
 of
 their
 with
 some


of
 their
 most
 uh
 recent
 measures
 and
 the


interviews
 when
 when
 UCP
 MLAs
 give
 the


interviews
 itself
 because
 they've
 been


they've
 been
 coached
 not
 to
 provide


interviews
 or
 talk
 to
 constituents
 it's


almost
 always
 uh
 you
 know
 their
 response


is
 almost
 always
 well
 it's
 better
 to
 do


this
 then
 allow
 the
 new
 Democrats
 to
 be


in
 power.
 And
 so
 that
 that's
 really
 the


the
 dark
 side
 of
 hyperartisanship.
 In


the
 book,
 we
 talk
 about
 how


partisansship
 itself
 is
 is
 not


necessarily
 a
 bad
 thing
 for
 democracy.


It
 helps
 to
 organize
 votes
 and
 campaigns


and
 make
 things
 a
 little
 easier
 for


voters
 to
 understand,
 but
 when
 it
 tips


across
 that
 line
 into
 affective


polarization,
 I
 think
 that's
 when
 we


start
 to
 see
 warning
 signs.


>> Alex,
 uh
 let's
 get
 share
 your
 take
 on


that
 as
 well.


I
 I
 think
 that
 really
 what
 we're
 looking


at
 is
 uh
 you
 know
 a
 bigger
 picture


question
 for
 me
 and
 that
 is
 that
 why
 why


is
 it
 like
 this
 in
 Canada?
 Why
 do
 we


have
 this
 situation?
 Why
 do
 we
 accept


it?
 Why
 is
 it
 that
 if
 somebody
 does


something
 that
 is
 you
 know
 speaking
 up


on
 behalf
 of
 the
 people
 who
 elected
 them


or
 something
 that's
 a
 matter
 of
 their


own
 convictions
 or
 frankly
 they
 just
 see


something
 and
 they
 think
 it's
 wrong.
 Why


is
 it
 such
 a
 big
 deal?
 And
 why
 is
 it
 so


awful
 if
 an
 elected
 representative
 comes


out
 and
 says
 something
 that
 goes
 against


the
 team
 or
 goes
 against
 their
 leader?


You
 know,
 they're
 they're
 celebrated
 in


some
 quarters
 as
 um
 somebody
 who
 is


authentic
 and
 somebody
 who's
 a
 good


representative
 and
 then
 in
 other
 ways


they're
 treated
 as
 a
 maverick,
 as
 an


anomaly,
 as
 somebody
 who
 absolutely
 has


to
 be
 tamped
 down.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 the


broader
 question
 I
 would
 have
 for


Canadians
 and
 uh
 Ontarians
 generally
 is


why
 why
 do
 we
 accept
 this?
 Why
 does
 it


have
 to
 be
 this
 way?


>> Alex,
 can
 you
 help
 pull
 the
 curtain
 back


a
 little
 bit
 in
 terms
 of
 what's


happening
 behind
 the
 scenes
 uh
 within
 a


caucus,
 trying
 to
 keep
 everything
 in


line?
 I'm
 trying
 to
 when
 you
 when
 Jared


was
 talking,
 I
 the
 first
 visual
 I
 got


was
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 football
 team
 uh


prepping
 before
 a
 game,
 getting
 everyone


together,
 getting
 everyone
 hyp.
 But
 in


in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 in
 times
 of


conflict,
 uh
 what
 is
 what
 is
 happening


in
 a
 caucus?
 Well,
 maybe
 I
 can
 explain


two
 things
 and
 they're
 both
 driven
 by


technology
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 would


not
 know
 happens
 behind
 the
 scenes
 that


really
 conditions
 things.
 So,
 the
 first


thing
 we
 hear
 about
 every
 now
 and
 then


is
 the
 candidate
 vetting
 process
 that


goes
 on
 uh
 surrounding
 elections
 and
 the


amount
 of
 scrutiny
 that
 goes
 in
 to
 look


into
 the
 background
 of
 people
 uh
 to
 get


a
 sense
 of,
 you
 know,
 has
 anybody
 done


anything
 that
 could
 cause
 embarrassment


or
 be
 a
 distraction
 during
 the
 election


campaign.
 I
 I
 completely
 understand
 why


political
 parties
 do
 that.
 They
 need
 to


manage
 their
 brands
 and
 they
 need
 to


control
 the
 narrative.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 what
 that
 does
 is
 that
 means
 that


anybody
 who
 is,
 you
 know,
 got
 a


reputation
 of
 being
 outspoken
 or
 a
 bit


of
 a
 maverick
 or
 a
 bit
 controversial


might
 get
 screened
 out.
 And
 so
 you
 end


up
 bringing
 in
 people
 who
 are
 told


always
 repeat
 what
 the
 me
 uh
 the
 message


of
 the
 day
 is,
 what
 the
 leader
 is
 doing.


Don't
 cause
 a
 distraction.
 Now
 you
 get


elected.
 Now
 you
 go
 into
 the
 legislature


and
 what
 happens
 often
 is
 uh
 in
 the


mornings
 you
 will
 get
 uh
 messages
 that


are
 sent
 to
 you
 uh
 on
 your
 phone
 and


you're
 checking
 your
 phone
 and
 what
 it


says
 is
 okay
 here
 are
 the
 hot
 issues.
 Um


here
 are
 the
 here's
 the
 key
 message
 and


here
 it
 is
 who's
 the
 spokesperson
 and


you
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 are


repeating
 those
 messages
 and
 if
 the


media
 has
 anything
 they
 want
 to
 talk
 to


you
 about
 or
 a
 constituent
 or
 whoever
 it


might
 be
 direct
 them
 over
 that
 way.
 So


the
 whole
 thing
 is
 about
 making
 sure


that
 you
 have
 a
 team
 uh
 united
 construct


when
 it
 comes
 to
 messaging
 but
 that
 also


takes
 away
 individual
 voice.
 Want
 to


pick
 up
 actually
 on
 the
 media
 there
 uh


the
 media's
 role
 really
 uh
 Jared
 when
 an


MP
 expresses
 a
 different
 opinion
 from


their
 party
 leader.
 It
 creates
 this


frenzy.
 We
 see
 the
 microphones.
 We
 see


the
 scrums.
 Is
 that
 part
 of
 the
 problem?


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 don't
 blame
 the
 media,


right?
 I
 mean,
 it
 it's
 it's
 part
 of
 uh


you
 know,
 Canadian
 political
 culture
 to


expect
 parties
 to
 be
 cohesive
 and
 when


somebody
 steps
 out
 of
 line,
 it's
 seen
 as


being
 um
 you
 know,
 seen
 as
 being
 a
 a


story
 in
 and
 of
 itself
 because
 it's


because
 it's
 so
 rare.
 I
 think
 um
 you


know,
 media
 outlets
 with
 the
 Donmont


crossing,
 I
 think
 honestly
 was
 a
 bit
 was


a
 bit
 different
 in
 in
 terms
 of
 the


framing
 um
 from
 from
 previous
 episodes.


um
 the
 media's
 framing
 around
 Nate


Erskin
 Smith's
 um
 frequent
 disagreements


with
 with
 his
 party
 leadership
 uh
 within


the
 Liberal
 caucus.
 I
 think
 um
 the
 media


has
 gotten
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 nuanced


over
 time
 and
 our
 book
 actually
 we


looked
 at
 over
 3,000
 different
 news


articles
 related
 to
 to
 party
 defection


since
 1980.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 have
 seen
 a


shift
 where
 people
 are
 starting
 to


appreciate
 the
 value
 of
 of
 independence


of
 MPs.
 Now,
 whe
 whether
 that
 translates


into
 uh
 you
 know,
 the
 way
 that
 that


people
 or
 Canadians
 expect
 their
 um


their
 their
 parliamentarians
 to
 behave


or
 the
 way
 that
 leaders
 and
 partisans
 do


is
 is
 quite
 another
 story.


>> Alex,
 party
 leaders
 describe
 their
 party


like
 a
 family,
 which
 also
 means
 that


there
 are
 disagreements
 that
 happen
 uh


at
 the
 dinner
 table,
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 we
 still
 we
 still
 love
 each


other.
 Is
 it
 a
 really
 is
 that
 a
 real
 is


that
 really
 a
 good
 appropriate
 um


description?


>> Uh
 it
 is
 for
 I
 mean
 it's
 not
 just
 the


leaders
 who
 say
 it.
 It's
 a
 lot
 of


parliamentarians
 will
 say
 it
 and
 they


feel
 a
 sense
 of
 attachment
 like
 you


often
 do
 when
 you're
 you're
 part
 of
 a


tight
 group
 uh
 whether
 it's
 at
 your


place
 of
 work
 or
 whether
 you've
 joined
 a


sports
 team
 or
 whatever
 the
 case.


>> All right,
 we
 have
 a
 few
 minutes
 left.
 I


want
 to
 get
 to
 some
 of
 these
 solutions


and
 recommendations.
 Uh
 Jared,
 in
 the


book
 you
 propose
 some
 of
 those
 solutions


to
 break
 down
 the
 hyperartisan
 system.


You
 you
 mentioned
 one
 there,
 but
 uh
 can


you
 share
 a
 few?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 uh
 the
 the
 one
 that
 I


touched
 on
 earlier
 I
 I
 think
 is
 is
 the


lowhanging
 fruit,
 which
 is
 to
 to
 change


the
 way
 that
 we
 orient
 uh


parliamentarians
 to
 their
 jobs.
 And
 I


know
 uh
 anybody
 that's
 been
 to
 new
 to
 a


job
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 like
 drinking
 from


a
 fire
 hose
 in
 the
 in
 the
 opening
 days


and
 weeks.
 So
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 this


happens
 on
 day
 one,
 but
 I
 think
 it


happens
 over
 the
 course
 of
 their
 first


few
 years
 um
 in
 office.
 And
 that
 that's


to
 actually
 just
 go
 back
 to
 basics
 and


tell
 them
 yes,
 parties
 are
 an
 important


part
 of
 Canadian
 democracy,
 but
 there


are
 bigger
 principles
 at
 play,
 right?
 We


we
 have
 a
 system
 of
 responsible


government
 where
 the
 government
 of
 the


day
 uh
 is
 accountable
 to
 the
 legislature


and
 that
 means
 folks
 on
 both
 sides
 of


the
 house
 are
 are
 responsible
 for


holding
 the
 government
 to
 account
 and


that
 means
 maybe
 sometimes
 uh
 stepping


out
 either
 in
 caucus
 or
 in
 public
 to
 to


call
 the
 government
 uh
 to
 to
 order,


right?
 Um
 I
 think
 also
 talking
 to
 them
 a


bit
 more
 about
 their
 role
 as


representatives
 as
 we
 talk
 about
 in
 the


book
 is
 is
 also
 important.
 So
 they
 don't


they're
 not
 just
 partisan


representatives.
 They
 have
 to
 wear
 a


bunch
 of
 different
 hats.
 their
 their


delegates
 on
 behalf
 of
 their


constituents.
 But
 particularly
 in
 times


of
 national
 crisis
 where
 things
 that


happen
 that
 are
 unanticipated,
 they
 have


to
 be
 trustees
 of
 the
 public
 good.
 They


have
 to
 go
 and
 deliberate
 as
 a
 group
 of


parliamentarians
 to
 come
 to
 the
 best,


you
 know,
 best
 outcome
 for
 all


Canadians.
 And
 wearing
 that
 delegate,


trustee,
 and
 and
 partisan
 hat
 at
 the


same
 time
 can
 be
 challenging,
 but
 it's


something
 that
 that
 we
 recommend
 uh


parliament's
 legislators
 across
 the


country
 consider.


>> Alex,
 you
 get
 the
 last
 word.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 one
 thing
 we
 need
 to
 do
 is


somehow
 find
 a
 way
 for
 political
 parties


to
 agree
 to
 make
 it
 easier
 for


independents
 to
 get
 elected
 and
 easier


for
 independents
 to
 have
 access
 to
 uh


their
 responsibilities
 in
 the


legislature.
 Um
 I
 think
 you
 know
 off
 top


of
 my
 head
 there's
 there's
 four


independents
 who
 have
 been
 elected
 as


independents
 in
 provincial
 legislatores


right
 now
 including
 in
 Ontario
 and
 Bobby


uh
 Brady
 and
 we
 need
 more
 Bobby
 and


Brady's
 and
 other
 independents
 not
 too


many
 of
 them
 mind
 you
 but
 we
 just
 need
 a


few
 in
 every
 legislature
 to
 be
 able
 to


say
 things
 that
 political
 parties
 won't


say
 you
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


independents
 will
 say
 is
 that
 members
 of


other
 political
 parties
 will
 come
 over


to
 them
 and
 say
 can
 you
 raise
 this
 issue


in
 the
 legislature
 because
 I
 can't


>> that
 says
 a


All
 right,
 gentlemen.
