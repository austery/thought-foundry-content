Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 Odd
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 [music]
 I'm


Tracy
 Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> Joe,
 we're
 in
 Boston.


>> I
 know.
 Uh
 we've
 never
 done
 an
 OddLotss


thing
 in
 Boston
 of
 any
 sort,
 have
 we?


>> No.
 Uh,
 this
 is
 actually
 my
 first
 time


in
 Boston.
 I've
 been
 to
 the
 airport
 a


few
 times,
 but
 I've
 never
 actually


stayed
 in
 the
 city.
 And
 everything
 I


know
 about
 Boston
 comes
 from
 the
 Boston,


New
 York
 rivalry
 as
 depicted
 in
 30
 Rock.


So,
 I
 know
 nothing
 [laughter]
 basically,


>> you
 know.
 And
 um,
 and
 I
 lived
 in
 Vermont


for
 several
 years
 in
 high
 school.
 Boston


that
 was
 the
 big
 city
 like
 people
 and


like
 people
 aspired
 to
 go
 to
 Boston.
 I


knew
 went
 to
 I
 knew
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 went


to
 college
 here
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.
 I


love
 it
 here.
 I'm
 excited
 to
 be
 here.


You
 know,
 the
 big
 city
 closest
 to
 my


house
 in
 Connecticut
 is
 Worcester,


Massachusetts.
 That's
 the
 big
 one.


That's
 a
 nice
 city,
 too.


>> It's
 about
 40
 minutes
 away.
 So,


>> all
 right.
 Well,
 the
 reason
 we
 are
 here


is
 for
 the
 Boston
 Fed,
 which
 is
 holding


their
 69th
 economic
 conference,
 and
 the


theme
 of
 this
 year's
 is
 the
 US
 economy


in
 a
 changing
 global
 landscape,
 which
 is


putting
 it
 mildly.
 I
 think


>> it
 is
 uh
 putting
 it
 mildly.
 There's


there's
 a
 lot
 going
 on
 globally.
 All


kinds
 of
 things.
 You
 could
 just
 run
 down


the
 list.
 We
 don't
 even
 have
 to


summarize
 it,
 but
 it
 is
 a
 a
 time
 of


change
 both
 macro
 big
 picture
 globally,


but
 also
 just
 for
 the
 near-term


direction
 of
 monetary
 policy
 right
 now


in
 the
 United
 States,
 probably
 as


ambiguous
 as
 it's
 been
 in
 a
 while.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 so.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 that


reflected
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 Fed
 speak


that's
 been
 coming
 out
 at
 the
 moment.
 We


have
 doves
 on
 the
 one
 side
 who
 are


talking
 about
 a
 deteriorating
 labor


market
 and
 then
 we
 have
 hawks
 on
 the


other
 side
 who
 are
 still
 very
 concerned


that
 basically
 after
 5
 years
 of


inflation
 we
 have
 still
 not
 returned
 to


the
 2%
 target.
 It's
 been
 half
 a
 decade


>> right
 and
 as
 of
 right
 now
 recording
 this


November
 19th
 2025
 the
 warp
 function
 uh


looking
 at
 Fed
 fund
 futures
 gives
 about


a
 45%
 chance
 of
 a
 rate
 cut
 in
 December


that
 was
 in
 the
 high
 60s
 just
 a
 couple


of
 weeks
 ago.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 things,
 a
 lot


of
 uncertainty,
 more
 or
 less
 a
 coin
 flip


right
 now.
 We
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 on


in
 the
 medium-term
 or
 the
 long
 term.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 say
 one
 more
 thing
 before


we
 get
 to
 our
 very
 esteemed
 guest,
 but


there
 is
 another
 complication,
 which
 is


we've
 had
 the
 government
 shutdown,


right?
 So,
 we
 haven't
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 the


economic
 data.
 By
 the
 time
 this
 episode


comes
 out,
 there
 might
 have
 been
 some
 of


the
 economic
 data,
 but
 we
 also
 have
 Fed


minutes
 that
 are
 due
 out
 later
 today.


But
 to
 emphasize,
 as
 of
 this
 morning,


everything
 is
 very,
 very
 uncertain.


>> Uh,
 the
 fog,
 that's
 like
 the
 term


everyone's
 using.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 fog
 out
 in


the
 Boston
 Harbor
 right
 now
 as
 well.
 So,


uh,
 fog,
 fog
 everywhere.
 Okay,
 so


without
 further
 ado,
 we
 have
 the
 perfect


guest
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 changing
 US


economic
 landscape
 and
 what
 it
 means
 for


monetary
 policy.
 We're
 going
 to
 be


speaking
 with
 Boston
 Fed
 President
 Susan


Collins.
 So,
 Susan,
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 coming
 on
 All
 Thoughts.
 I
 am


delighted
 to
 be
 here
 and
 welcome
 to


Boston.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 I
 heard
 I'm
 supposed


to
 eat
 beans
 and
 lobster.
 Is
 that
 right?


All
 right,
 I'll
 do
 that
 later.


>> Okay,
 perfect.
 So,
 tell
 us
 firstly
 about


this
 research
 conference.
 What's
 the


purpose
 of
 the
 Fed
 gathering
 people


together
 to
 talk
 about,
 you
 know,
 you


have
 a
 series
 of
 papers
 here
 all
 with


different
 themes
 and
 topics.
 Why
 do


this?


>> Sure.
 happy
 to
 talk
 about
 our
 conference


and
 I
 have
 to
 say
 I
 and
 our
 entire
 team


are
 delighted
 that
 you
 are
 both
 going
 to


be
 joining
 us
 for
 our
 day
 and
 a
 half


conference.


>> We
 can't
 we
 can't
 say
 no
 to
 a
 conference


full
 of
 academic
 economic
 papers.


>> Lots
 of
 PDFs
 to
 read.
 [laughter]


>> Well,
 it
 will
 be
 quite
 u
 meaty
 and


informative.
 You
 know,
 it's
 not
 just


academics
 and
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 I
 think
 is
 really
 important
 to
 us


and
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 makes
 it


particularly
 valuable.
 So
 we
 bring


together
 and
 this
 is
 the
 69th
 Boston


conference.
 It's
 our
 flagship.
 You
 know


we
 do
 other
 meetings
 and
 conferences
 and


other
 things
 but
 this
 one
 is
 our


flagship
 and
 we
 bring
 together
 academics


certainly.
 We
 bring
 together
 policy


makers
 from
 different
 institutions.
 We


bring
 together
 business
 leaders.
 We
 have


a
 wide
 range
 of
 people.
 We
 actually
 have


people
 from
 different
 disciplines.
 So


one
 of
 the
 papers
 is
 from
 a
 political


scientist
 as
 well.
 So,
 so
 that
 is
 is


kind
 of
 a
 hallmark
 of
 the
 conference
 is


to
 really
 do
 a
 deep
 dive
 to
 understand


dimensions
 of
 a
 topic.
 And
 we
 picked
 a


pretty
 big
 one
 this
 time.
 So,
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 suggest
 we're
 going
 to
 cover


the
 entire
 thing,
 but
 understanding
 the


US
 economy
 in
 what
 is
 a
 changing
 global


landscape
 related
 to
 risks
 and


uncertainties
 to
 fragmentation.
 It's
 a


lot
 to
 talk
 about
 and
 I'm
 really
 looking


forward
 to
 being
 part
 of
 it,
 to
 learning


and
 to
 hearing
 the
 presentations.


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 like
 create
 any
 tension


between
 you
 and
 the
 fellow
 regional
 Fed


presidents,
 but
 doesn't
 it
 feel
 like


Kansas
 City
 cheats
 a
 little
 bit
 by


having
 their
 [laughter]
 conference
 in


Wyoming
 and
 August,
 etc.
 Like,


>> we're
 in
 Boston
 in
 November,


>> which
 is
 great.
 And
 it's
 lovely
 here.


And
 it's
 lovely.


>> What's
 wrong
 with
 Boston
 in
 November?


But
 I
 just
 I
 [laughter]
 always
 feel
 like


it's
 kind
 of
 cheating
 that's
 like,
 "Oh,


we're
 not
 even
 going
 to
 have
 it
 in
 our


in
 the
 exact
 location
 and
 we're
 going
 to


have
 it
 some
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 summer
 in


this
 beautiful
 location."
 It
 is
 kind
 of


cheating
 a
 little.


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 the
 Jackson
 Hall


conference
 is
 a
 very
 special
 one.
 I
 have


been
 participating
 in
 that
 for
 a
 long


time
 and
 I'm
 a
 huge
 proponent
 and
 I
 just


say
 the
 more
 the
 marrier.
 You
 know,
 it's


a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


>> A
 positive
 abundance
 mindset
 for


conference.


>> That's
 right.
 That's
 right.
 So,
 let's


talk
 actually,
 you
 know,
 we'll
 get
 into


we
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the
 big


themes.
 We
 want
 to
 talk,
 let's
 talk
 a


little
 bit
 of
 near-term
 monetary
 policy,


etc.
 Odds
 of
 a
 December
 cut
 have
 come
 in


dramatically
 because
 you
 and
 some
 of
 the


other
 members
 of
 the
 FOMC
 have
 been


talking
 about
 this
 concern
 that


inflation
 remains
 stubbornly
 overtarget.


That
 being
 said,
 there
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 a


lot
 of
 evidence
 of
 labor
 market


weakening,
 right?
 and
 we
 haven't
 got
 the


unemployment
 rate
 for
 a
 while,
 but


basically
 every
 measure
 seems
 to
 show
 a


significant
 I
 don't
 know
 stall,
 etc.


Talk
 to
 us
 about
 your
 read
 on
 the
 labor


market
 right
 now.
 Are
 you
 concerned
 that


some
 of
 the
 weakness
 that
 we've
 seen


could
 snowball
 into
 seriously


deteriorating
 environment
 and
 a
 sharp


increase
 in
 the
 unemployment
 rate?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 appreciate
 your
 framing
 of


that.
 I
 I
 you
 know
 I
 have
 to
 start
 by


saying
 I'm
 really
 focused
 on
 both
 parts


of
 our
 mandate
 and
 that
 does
 mean
 the


labor
 market
 say
 more
 about
 that
 in
 just


a
 hot
 second
 but
 also
 concerns
 about
 the


elevated
 inflation
 and
 what
 I
 hear
 about


that
 and
 our
 commitment
 to
 price


stability.
 So,
 you
 know,
 they
 both


really
 matter
 and
 I'm
 looking
 at
 both
 of


them
 that
 that's
 really
 what
 I've
 been


emphasizing.
 As
 far
 as
 the
 labor
 market,


you
 know,
 it
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 an
 unusual


situation
 in
 some
 ways,
 right?
 I
 mean


what
 I
 think
 is
 pretty
 clear
 is
 that
 we


have
 seen
 softening
 in
 the
 labor
 market.


We
 are
 pulling
 together
 all
 the
 data


that
 we
 can
 find
 but
 as
 you
 pointed
 out


earlier
 we
 don't
 have
 the
 official
 data


yet.
 We'll
 get
 a
 jobs
 report
 from


September
 tomorrow
 morning
 and
 really


eager
 to
 see
 that.
 And
 so
 it's
 hard
 to


tell
 how
 much
 that
 softening
 has
 been


but
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 clear
 it
 reflects


both
 labor
 supply
 growth
 having
 slowed


pretty
 notably
 but
 also
 labor
 demand


growth.
 And
 so
 so
 far
 it
 seems
 and
 again


we'll
 learn
 more
 that
 there's
 a
 kind
 of


rough
 unusual
 balance
 there
 and
 so
 we


haven't
 seen
 a
 significant
 unemployment


change
 but
 that's
 something
 I'm
 watching


really
 carefully
 and
 I'm
 really
 attuned


to.


>> Just
 to
 follow
 up
 though
 on
 we
 have
 not


seen
 a
 significant
 unemployment
 change


setting
 aside
 the
 data
 which
 is
 going
 to


be
 noisy
 for
 all
 kinds
 of
 reasons


because
 that's
 September
 which
 is
 ages


ago
 and
 then
 the
 date
 after
 that
 will
 be


you
 know
 affected
 by
 the
 government


shutdown
 itself
 which
 is
 why
 we're


weren't
 getting
 data.
 So,
 who
 knows
 how


long
 it'll
 be
 until
 we
 have
 clean
 data.


But
 that
 being
 said,
 do
 you
 have
 any
 way


to
 like
 anticipate
 actual
 deterioration?


Because
 the
 concern
 is
 that
 once
 the


unemployment,
 the
 layoffs
 really
 start


to
 snowball,
 then
 they
 start
 to
 feed
 on


each
 other
 and
 they
 build
 they


accelerate
 and
 people
 talk
 about


nonlinearity
 potential.
 Do
 you
 are
 you


concerned
 that
 by
 waiting
 or
 too
 much


for
 the
 data
 to
 reveal
 oh
 the
 weakness


is
 here
 that
 you
 won't
 have
 been
 able
 to


get
 around
 get
 in
 front
 of
 a


deterioration.


>> It's
 really
 important
 to
 be


forward-looking
 and
 as
 you
 say
 I
 also


have
 seen
 past
 episodes
 where
 there's


been
 a
 dynamic
 which
 can
 move
 quickly


and
 so
 it's
 important
 to
 recognize
 that.


So
 are
 there
 risks
 on
 the
 labor
 market


side?
 Absolutely.
 and
 that's
 something


that
 I'm
 attuned
 to.
 But
 that's
 not
 the


only
 consideration
 in
 terms
 of
 making


monetary
 policy
 decisions.
 It's
 really


about
 balancing
 those
 risks
 and
 looking


at
 to
 the
 best
 of
 one's
 ability.
 You


know,
 how
 do
 you
 assess
 which
 of
 our


goals
 from
 Congress
 is
 further
 away?
 And


I
 think
 that
 the
 reasons
 that
 you're


talking
 about
 some
 of
 that
 shift
 in


risks
 increase
 in
 risks
 in
 the
 labor


market
 was
 a
 good
 reason
 for
 the
 easing


the
 50%
 basis
 point
 cuts
 that
 we
 have


already
 done
 this
 fall.
 And
 I
 think
 that


that
 has
 actually
 positioned
 us
 given


what
 I
 know
 now
 and
 obviously
 still


watching
 lots
 of
 caveats.
 And
 so
 I
 I


think
 that
 that
 the
 shift
 in
 that


balance
 of
 risks
 that
 I
 started
 being


quite
 focused
 on
 over
 the
 summer
 was


really
 a
 rationale
 for
 those
 cuts
 that


we've
 already
 seen.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 we


have
 now
 moved
 much
 closer
 to
 a
 neutral


rate
 and
 we're
 balancing


those
 risks
 on
 the
 labor
 market
 side


with
 continued
 risks
 related
 to


inflation
 and
 elevation
 and
 policy
 is


really
 only
 mildly
 restrictive
 in
 my


view.
 And
 so
 I
 given
 what
 I'm
 seeing
 so


far
 continue
 to
 see
 that
 as
 appropriate


for
 now.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 into
 each


one
 of
 those
 points,
 but
 I
 have
 a
 very


quick
 process
 question.
 And
 I
 realize


we're
 in
 unusual
 circumstances
 at
 the


moment,
 but
 when
 the
 jobs
 number
 hits


presumably
 tomorrow
 on
 Thursday,
 again,


we're,
 you
 know,
 we're
 recording
 this
 on


Wednesday,
 November
 19th,
 but
 when
 it


comes
 out,
 what
 actually
 happens?
 What


do
 you
 do
 when
 when
 you
 see
 that
 number?


Do
 you,
 you
 know,
 immediately
 go
 into


analysis
 mode?
 Do
 you
 start
 calling


fellow
 Fed
 presidents
 and
 talking
 about


what
 it
 means?
 What
 do
 you
 what?
 Hey,


that's
 a
 great
 question.
 So,
 you
 know,


of
 course,
 we
 have
 busy
 schedules
 and


all
 kinds
 of
 other
 things
 going
 on
 and


sometimes
 when
 the
 data
 hits,
 I'm
 in


other
 meetings
 or
 with
 other
 groups.
 I


am
 well
 aware
 of
 when
 it
 is
 due
 and
 we


do
 have
 a
 process.
 I
 have
 a
 very
 strong


Boston
 research
 team
 of
 experts
 and
 so


you
 know
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 numbers
 come
 out


I
 do
 try
 to
 take
 a
 quick
 look
 at
 them


and
 then
 we
 are
 sometimes
 uh
 virtually


and
 you
 know
 get
 together
 relatively


quickly
 to
 assess
 what
 we're
 seeing
 in


those
 numbers
 so
 I
 have
 help
 to
 try
 to


unpack
 them.
 Often
 the
 real
 information


is
 in
 the
 details.
 It's
 not
 necessarily


just
 the
 headline
 number.
 In
 fact,
 that


can
 mask
 a
 lot
 of
 what's
 really


interesting
 about
 the
 information.
 We


then
 take
 some
 time
 to
 unpack
 it
 and
 we


want
 to
 contrast
 those
 data
 with
 what
 we


had
 already
 seen,
 right?
 Because
 you're


adding
 new
 information.
 It's
 not
 going


onto
 a
 kind
 of
 totally
 clean
 pallet,


right?
 It's
 additional
 information.
 So


we
 are
 doing
 all
 of
 that
 and
 I'm
 working


with
 my
 team
 and
 then
 I
 do
 of
 course


talk
 to
 my
 colleagues
 as
 well
 but
 the


immediate
 analysis
 is
 more
 within
 our


teams
 in
 each
 of
 our
 reserve
 banks.


>> And
 one
 more
 process
 question
 but
 it


strikes
 me
 that
 one
 of
 the
 unusual


features
 of
 our
 very
 unusual
 environment


at
 the
 moment
 is
 just
 the
 sheer
 amount


of
 Fed
 speakers
 that
 we've
 had
 in
 recent


days.
 I
 started
 counting
 them
 up


yesterday
 and
 I
 got
 nine
 in
 less
 than
 a


week.
 And
 I
 think
 then
 our
 friend
 Tom


Barkin,
 friend
 of
 the
 pod,
 put
 out
 a


speech
 or
 a
 research
 note
 as
 well.
 So


that
 brings
 it
 up
 to
 10
 in
 less
 than
 a


week.
 What's
 going
 on?
 Why
 does
 everyone


have
 the
 urge
 to
 sort
 of
 stake
 their


ground
 ahead
 of
 a
 meeting
 that
 you
 know


the
 market
 currently
 implies
 could
 be
 a


coin
 flip?
 Well,
 all
 the
 more
 reason
 to


hear
 range
 of
 views.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 strengths
 of
 the
 structure
 of
 our


federated
 system
 is
 it
 really
 does
 bring


different
 viewpoints.
 And
 you
 know,
 it's


interesting
 because
 sometimes
 there's
 a


claim
 that
 there's
 too
 much
 group
 think.


I
 don't
 see
 group
 think.
 I
 see
 this


week.
 No,
 I
 really
 don't.
 And
 so,
 I


think
 we
 have
 also
 a
 responsibility
 to


explain
 what
 we're
 seeing,
 how
 we're


thinking
 about
 things.
 And
 that's
 part


of
 that
 communication
 that
 we
 do.
 And


and
 so
 I
 I
 actually
 think
 that's


important.
 And
 I
 think
 recognizing
 that


the
 breadth
 of
 views
 is
 partly
 us
 coming


together
 is
 sharing
 information
 and
 is


part
 of
 that
 process.
 So
 there
 there


different
 windows
 when
 I
 think
 you
 hear


lots
 of
 speeches.
 This
 is
 certainly
 not


an
 isolated
 time
 but
 it's
 when
 there's


you
 know
 kind
 of
 less
 clarity
 perhaps


when
 they're
 turning
 points
 in
 the


economy
 when
 you're
 more
 likely
 to
 see


many
 of
 us
 out
 there
 talking
 about
 what


we're
 seeing.
 also
 talking
 about
 how
 our


regional
 information
 contributes
 to
 that


in
 different
 ways.
 And
 we're
 often


talking
 while
 we're
 out
 in
 our
 regions


connecting
 with
 different
 people.
 And
 so


there's
 kind
 of
 multiple
 dimensions


about
 why
 we're
 out
 and
 about
 and
 what


we're
 doing.

Let's
 talk
 about
 inflation.
 So
 core
 PCE


as
 of
 the
 August
 reading,
 which
 again


feels
 like
 ages
 ago
 now,
 but
 it's
 the


data
 that
 we
 have.
 So
 that
 came
 in
 at


2.9%.
 So
 that's
 clearly
 elevated
 solidly


above
 target.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 just
 had


like
 a
 snapshot,
 you're
 looking
 at
 the


unemployment
 rate,
 you're
 looking
 at
 the


inflation
 reading,
 that
 2.9%.


How
 much
 does
 the
 significance
 of
 that


change
 because
 it
 comes
 after
 years
 of


missing
 the
 inflation
 target
 to
 the


upside
 versus
 if
 we
 just
 had
 the


snapshot?
 Like,
 how
 much
 of
 your


thinking
 is
 sort
 of
 informed
 by
 the
 fact


that
 not
 only
 has
 it
 been
 high,
 but
 it's


been
 high
 for
 a
 really
 long
 time?
 I
 do


think
 that
 the
 longevity
 of
 that


elevation
 is
 a
 key
 factor
 to
 to
 figure.


It's
 hard
 to
 you
 know
 to
 put
 a


particular
 weight
 on
 that
 but


>> you
 think
 about
 the
 balance
 of
 risks


going
 forward.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 But
 so
 let
 me
 say
 a
 few


things
 on
 the
 inflation
 side.
 First


related
 to
 that
 specific
 question,
 you


know,
 I
 do
 think
 that
 it
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a


reminder
 that
 it's
 economic
 behavior


that
 is
 not,
 you
 know,
 100%
 predictable


and
 many
 of
 our
 analyses
 that
 are
 based


on
 periods
 when
 people
 were
 really
 used


to
 very
 low
 inflation,
 maybe
 a
 bit


noisier
 signals
 of
 what
 kind
 of


responses
 and
 changes
 we're
 going
 to


see.
 And
 so
 I
 do
 think
 that


complementing
 those
 analyses,
 you
 know,


of
 course
 those
 are
 extremely
 valuable


and
 we
 continue
 to
 look
 at
 we're
 total


we're
 all
 data
 geeks
 here,
 you
 know,


that's
 that's
 kind
 of
 what
 we
 do
 with


the
 conversations
 we
 have
 understanding


how
 businesses
 are
 thinking
 about


things.
 And
 so
 I
 hear
 that
 businesses


are
 mindful
 that
 they
 have
 raised
 prices


significantly
 over
 recent
 years.
 They're


concerned
 about
 what
 consumer
 responses


will
 be.
 I've
 recently
 been
 hearing
 a


number
 of
 firms
 at
 least
 in
 the
 New


England
 district,
 the
 Boston
 Feds


district,
 which
 is
 most
 of
 New
 England,


saying
 that
 that
 they
 have
 been
 passing


price
 increases
 and
 they
 have
 been


perhaps
 surprised
 in
 some
 cases
 that


consumers
 are
 not
 pushing
 back
 and


that's
 leading
 them
 to
 expect
 that
 they


might
 continue
 to
 do
 that,
 you
 know.
 So


I
 think
 that
 gathering
 a
 range
 of


information
 to
 complement
 how
 what
 our


understanding
 of
 behavior
 is
 important


and
 that
 does
 factor
 into
 some
 of
 the


scenarios
 I
 think
 are
 plausible.
 They're


not
 necessarily
 my
 baseline.
 My
 baseline


scenario
 on
 the
 inflation
 side
 is
 that


inflation's
 likely,
 I
 think,
 to
 stay


elevated
 through
 the
 rest
 of
 this
 year


into
 early
 next
 and
 then
 as
 tariffs
 work


their
 way
 through
 the
 system,
 which
 I


think
 is
 going
 to
 take
 some
 time
 and
 I'm


happy
 to
 talk
 more
 about
 tariffs.


Suspect
 we
 may
 want
 to
 come
 back
 to


that.


>> Absolutely.


>> You
 know,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 disinflation


process
 perhaps
 slow
 and
 uneven
 that
 we


had
 seen
 earlier
 is
 likely
 to
 kick
 in.


So,
 so,
 so
 my
 baseline
 is
 a
 relatively


benign
 one
 both
 on
 the
 inflation
 side


and
 on
 the
 real
 side
 of
 the
 economy,
 but


I
 don't
 rule
 out
 scenarios
 where
 there's


a
 larger
 increase
 in
 inflation
 where


there's
 more
 persistence.
 And
 some
 of


that
 has
 to
 do
 with
 behavioral
 responses


that
 might
 reflect


having
 been
 in
 an
 elevated
 environment


for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 concerns
 about


profit
 margins,
 concerns
 about,
 you


know,
 catching
 up
 to
 some
 of
 the
 past


changes
 and
 how
 people
 think
 about
 price


levels,
 which
 is
 something
 that
 many
 of


our
 models
 are
 not
 as
 focused
 on.
 I
 hear


a
 lot
 about
 price
 levels
 when
 I'm
 out


and
 about,
 but
 high
 cost
 of
 living,


housing
 in
 particular,
 but
 not
 only


child
 care,
 food,
 that
 that
 is
 the


number
 one
 challenge
 that
 I
 hear
 about


when
 I'm
 talking
 to
 people,
 particularly


low
 and
 moderate
 income
 communities,
 but


not
 only.
 So,
 since
 we're
 at
 a
 research


conference
 at
 the
 Boston
 Fed,
 I
 need
 to


bring
 up
 a
 really
 good
 research
 paper


that
 came
 out
 of
 the
 Boston
 Fed
 back
 in


October,
 I
 think,
 and
 it
 was
 looking
 at


inflation
 expectations
 now
 and
 comparing


them
 to
 what
 happened
 in
 the
 early
 and


late
 1970s.
 And
 the
 finding
 was
 that
 the


rise
 in
 inflation
 expectations
 around
 CO


might
 not
 have
 had
 that
 much
 to
 do
 with


actual
 prices
 but
 actually
 outran
 the


prices
 and
 sort
 of
 became
 deankored
 a


little
 bit
 from
 reality
 which
 is
 what
 we


saw
 in
 the
 the
 late
 1970s.


is
 the
 concern
 that
 people,
 you
 know,


after
 five
 years
 of
 above
 target


inflation,
 after
 price
 levels
 going
 up,


as
 you
 just
 put
 it,
 that
 our


expectations
 for
 inflation
 start
 to


become
 unmed
 from
 reality.
 Is
 that
 the


nightmare
 scenario
 for
 you
 at
 the


moment?


>> It
 certainly
 would
 be
 a
 concern
 if
 I


were
 to
 see
 evidence
 that
 especially


medium
 to
 longer
 term
 inflation


expectations
 were
 becoming
 unmed.
 I'm


not
 seeing
 that
 right
 now,
 but
 it
 is


something
 I
 watch
 carefully.
 And
 I
 do


think
 that
 at
 least
 certainly
 so
 far
 and


my
 baseline
 as
 I
 said
 is
 on
 the
 more


benign
 side,
 you
 know,
 is
 not
 expecting


that
 that
 would
 happen.
 In
 particular,


we're
 not
 seeing
 those
 labor
 market


pressures
 with
 a
 softer
 labor
 market,


but
 is
 it
 a
 concern?
 Is
 it
 something
 to


watch
 carefully?
 It
 is,
 and
 you
 know,


uh,
 it's
 something
 that
 I
 know
 some
 are


more
 concerned
 about
 than
 others.
 Well,


talk
 to
 us
 about
 how
 tariffs
 play
 into


inflation
 expectations
 because
 this


seems
 to
 be
 a
 difficult
 one
 to
 call.
 You


have
 the
 initial
 rise
 in
 prices
 and
 then


no
 one
 is
 quite
 sure
 what
 happens
 after


that.
 The
 consensus
 seems
 to
 be
 that


it's
 this
 one-off
 shift
 and
 then,
 you


know,
 inflation
 should
 start
 to
 cool.


But
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 we're
 hearing
 a


lot
 from
 consumers,
 as
 you
 say,
 about


price
 levels
 themselves.


So,
 quite
 a
 bit
 to
 say
 about
 tariffs.


So,
 you
 know,
 let
 me
 unpack
 a
 few
 of
 the


things
 that
 are
 really
 top
 of
 mind
 for


me.
 One
 is
 when
 certainly
 when
 I
 say


that,
 you
 know,
 my
 baseline
 expectation


would
 be
 that
 tariffs
 have
 a
 one-time


impact
 on
 prices,
 one
 time
 doesn't
 mean


it
 just
 happens
 in
 a
 week
 and
 it's
 done.


That
 one
 time
 can
 get
 implemented
 over


months,
 a
 year,
 something
 like
 that.
 It


just
 says
 that
 it's
 not
 expected
 to
 be
 a


continual
 increase.
 Once
 the
 level
 has


adjusted,
 you
 don't
 get
 additional


impacts.
 But
 that
 can
 happen
 over
 time.


So
 that's
 one
 point.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 that


in
 a
 period
 of
 high
 uncertainty
 and
 the


tariffs
 are
 really
 intertwined
 with


uncertainty,
 something
 to
 come
 back
 to


and
 the
 long
 elevation
 of
 higher
 prices


that
 we
 were
 just
 talking
 about.
 you


might
 actually
 expect
 the
 time
 for


businesses
 to
 pass
 things
 through
 to
 be


elongated,


>> right?
 And
 and
 so
 then
 you
 start


worrying
 more
 that
 people
 get
 used
 to


these
 continual
 price
 increases
 and
 you


kind
 of
 get
 stuck,
 right?
 So
 that's
 a


scenario
 again,
 not
 my
 baseline,
 but
 is


one
 that
 I
 think
 one
 could
 think
 about.


So
 a
 few
 things
 about
 tariffs.
 One
 is


the
 tariffs
 are
 really
 intertwined
 with


uncertainty
 which
 makes
 you
 know
 it's


uncertainty
 about
 the
 tariffs
 which
 is


one
 of
 the
 key
 things
 that's
 having


influence
 for
 example
 in
 terms
 of
 hiring


decisions
 investment
 decisions
 some
 of


the
 reticence
 that
 firms
 have
 to
 make


major
 decisions
 and
 projects
 and
 also
 in


terms
 of
 teasing
 out
 empirically
 right


it's
 going
 to
 take
 some
 time
 our
 staff


at
 the
 Boston
 Fed
 is
 doing
 quite
 a
 bit


of
 work
 on
 a
 variety
 of
 dimensions
 and


That
 includes
 analysis
 that
 takes
 into


account
 that
 you
 know
 many
 of
 the


tariffs
 are
 impacting
 imported


intermediates
 and
 so
 there
 multiple


dimensions
 and
 levels
 and
 you
 got
 to


take
 all
 of
 that
 into
 account
 and
 we're


also
 doing
 a
 lot
 of
 analysis
 on
 what


happened
 in
 2018.
 What
 can
 we
 learn
 from


that?
 Because
 we've
 had
 enough
 time


that's
 elapsed.
 And
 actually,
 one
 of
 the


papers
 at
 our
 conference
 will
 be
 drawing


some
 of
 the
 lessons
 from
 a
 kind
 of
 more


comprehensive
 analysis
 of
 that


experience.
 You
 know,
 just
 one
 thing


that
 they've
 already
 been
 talking
 about


is
 then
 was
 a
 much
 smaller
 tariff


increase.
 It
 was
 narrower
 and
 it
 was


implemented
 over
 a
 relatively
 short
 time


period.
 It
 still
 took
 five
 months
 or


more
 before
 the
 peak
 impact
 on
 price


levels
 was
 seen.
 And
 there
 reasons
 to


think
 it
 might
 take
 even
 longer
 this


time.
 And
 then
 the
 survey
 data,
 and


we're
 doing
 survey
 data
 at
 the
 Boston


Fed,
 particularly
 focused
 on
 small


businesses,
 which
 isn't
 a
 group
 we
 don't


have
 as
 much
 line
 of
 sight
 into,
 and
 the


conversations
 that
 I've
 talked
 about,


that
 helps
 to
 inform
 things.
 And
 then


just
 one
 final
 thing
 because
 I
 think
 is


both
 intellectually
 interesting,
 you


know, if
 I
 put
 my
 academic
 hat
 on,
 but


also
 really
 important.
 We've
 also
 seen


significant
 increases
 in
 productivity


and
 that
 is
 interacting
 with
 some
 of
 the


tariffs
 perhaps
 offsetting
 the
 extent
 to


which
 we're
 seeing
 the
 impacts
 of


tariffs
 on
 prices
 because
 productivity


growth
 is
 actually
 an
 opportunity
 not
 to


pass
 things
 through
 because
 it
 enables


you
 know
 cost
 savings
 etc.
 So
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 things
 going
 on
 with
 tariffs


which
 make
 them
 hard.
 I
 think
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 area
 we
 will
 be
 able
 to
 uh


we
 will
 continue
 studying
 and
 learning


about
 for
 some
 time
 to
 come.


>> I
 like
 your
 characterization
 of
 I
 guess


maybe
 you'd
 call
 it
 like
 the
 long


oneoff,
 right?
 There
 can
 be
 a
 one-off,


but
 it
 doesn't
 just
 mean
 the
 price
 level


resets
 from
 today
 to
 tomorrow.
 It
 could


just
 be
 the
 sort
 of
 long
 process
 where


some
 new
 equilibrium
 is
 formed,
 maybe


months,
 maybe
 years,
 etc.
 I'm
 really


interested
 though
 in
 those
 conversations


that
 you
 have
 with
 New
 England


businesses
 about
 tariffs.
 You
 mentioned


perhaps
 some
 of
 their
 surprise
 that
 they


were
 able
 to
 pass
 on
 price
 increases
 to


the
 degree
 that
 they
 have.
 What
 else
 are


companies
 saying
 about
 sort
 of
 the


operational
 effects,
 the
 day-to-day


effects
 of
 how
 they're
 managing
 their


business
 in
 light
 of
 tariffs?
 What


substantive
 things
 do
 you
 hear
 about?


>> So,
 a
 number
 of
 different
 number
 of


different
 things.
 A
 lot
 of the
 tariff


conversations
 that
 I've
 had
 really
 are


intertwined
 with
 navigating
 uncertainty.


So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that,
 you
 know,


I've
 heard
 is
 it's
 challenging
 to


navigate
 and
 make
 adjustments
 based
 on
 a


very
 different
 tariff
 level.
 But
 if
 we


knew
 exactly
 what
 it
 was
 and
 it
 was


going
 to
 stay
 there,
 that
 would
 be
 much


easier
 to
 adjust
 to
 than
 back
 and
 forth


and
 uncertainty.
 And
 that
 creates
 some


hesitancy.
 It
 also
 creates
 or
 adds
 to


because
 I
 think
 this
 was
 already
 there


what
 I'm
 calling
 almost
 an
 efficiency


mindset
 where
 firms
 are
 reticent
 to
 hire


because
 they're
 not
 sure
 how
 things
 are


evolving
 and
 tariffs
 are
 you
 know
 a
 cost


increase
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 you
 can


offset
 that
 through
 efficiencies


that
 is
 one
 way
 forward
 that
 is
 almost


kind
 of
 like
 a
 no
 regrets
 type
 of


investment
 because
 whatever
 happens
 with


the
 tariffs
 if
 you
 found
 efficiency


improvements
 that
 will
 have
 been
 a


helpful
 kind
 of
 context.
 So
 that
 links


up
 with
 AI
 but
 it's
 certainly
 not
 only


AI
 it's
 production
 processes
 it's


automation
 it's
 addressing
 some


longerstanding
 areas
 where
 it
 was


difficult
 to
 hire
 because
 of
 skilled


shortages.
 So
 a
 number
 of
 things
 that
 I


have
 been
 hearing
 since
 I
 started
 in
 the


role
 in
 2022
 continue


and
 then
 there's
 this
 additional
 set
 of


things
 that
 are
 added
 on.
 So
 for
 many


businesses
 especially
 the
 larger
 ones
 I


actually
 hear
 some
 kind
 of
 cautious


optimism
 as
 they
 look
 out
 ahead.
 It


depends
 somewhat
 on
 the
 sector.
 there


somewhat
 some
 differences
 and
 it
 depends


what
 some
 of
 the
 global
 linkages
 are
 and


some
 of
 those
 other
 competitive
 effects


but
 I've
 heard
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 that
 and
 a


bit
 more
 stress
 and
 concern
 among
 some


of
 the
 uh
 smaller
 firms
 in
 some
 places


and
 so
 that's
 part
 of
 why
 we're
 trying


to
 add
 to
 the
 information
 there
 through


a
 quarterly
 small
 business
 survey
 that


we
 started
 doing
 recently.


>> [music]


[music]


>> I
 hesitate
 to
 ask
 too
 many
 theoreticals


here,
 but
 I
 think
 this
 has
 actually


become
 less
 of
 a
 theoretical
 recently,


but
 the
 there
 is
 a
 good
 chance
 that
 the


Supreme
 Court
 strikes
 down
 a
 big
 chunk


of
 these
 tariffs.
 How
 would
 you
 as
 a


policy
 maker
 actually
 deal
 with,
 you


know,
 the
 approximate
 cause
 of
 this


one-time
 shift
 of
 inflation
 suddenly


being
 put
 in
 doubt?
 And
 then
 on
 top
 of


that,
 you
 also
 have
 more
 uncertainties


on
 the
 margin
 about
 whether
 or
 not


people
 might
 get
 tariff
 bonuses
 and
 then


whether
 or
 not
 businesses
 would
 receive


refund
 checks
 if
 the
 tariffs
 were,
 you


know,
 struck
 down
 by
 the
 Supreme
 Court.


That
 seems
 like
 a
 very
 complicated


scenario
 to
 be
 thinking
 about
 and
 much


less
 planning
 for
 there
 is
 considerable


uncertainty
 in
 this
 space
 as
 you
 just


pointed
 out
 and
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 know


how
 things
 will
 unfold
 and
 for
 some
 of


those
 things
 I
 think
 recognizing
 the


uncertainty
 and
 making
 assessments
 based


on
 the
 things
 that
 we
 know
 to
 some


extent
 looking
 at
 scenario
 planning
 but


some
 of
 the
 really
 hard
 to
 figure
 it
 out


how
 things
 would
 unfold.
 It
 may
 not
 be


helpful
 to
 get
 too
 far
 ahead
 of
 that.


So,
 you
 know,
 again
 to
 your
 point,


>> the
 uncertainty
 remains
 elevated.
 Maybe


the
 nature
 of
 the
 uncertainty
 is
 shifted


in
 some
 ways
 and
 it's
 something
 that
 I


think
 firms,
 households,
 local


governments
 are
 are
 navigating.


>> Quick
 question.
 Even
 with
 this
 the


slowdown
 in
 hiring
 etc.
 and
 the
 sort
 of


big
 changes
 to
 the
 labor
 market
 in
 the


last
 few
 years.
 Do
 you
 still
 regularly


hear
 about
 skilled
 labor
 shortages?


>> I
 do
 in
 some
 sectors
 and
 some
 areas
 and


and
 let
 me
 give
 you
 a
 couple
 of


examples.
 So
 for,
 you
 know,
 parts
 of
 New


England,
 New
 England
 is
 actually
 aging


faster
 than
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 country.


That's
 one
 of
 our
 distinguishing


features.
 We're,
 you
 know,
 quite


seasoned
 and
 we
 have
 many
 wonderful


advantages.
 And
 so
 there
 are
 places


where
 there
 is
 more
 of
 almost
 a
 labor


shortage.
 there's
 some
 skilled
 areas


where
 firms
 continue
 to
 tell
 me
 maybe


it's
 gotten
 a
 bit
 easier,
 but
 it's
 still


challenging
 to
 hire
 for
 certain
 kinds
 of


of
 trades.
 And
 so,
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 I've
 been
 really
 inspired
 to
 see


are
 innovative
 collaborations.
 So
 for


example
 in
 eastern
 Connecticut
 related


to
 skilled
 manufacturing
 pulling
 private


sector
 together
 with
 you
 know
 higher


education
 and
 support
 across
 local


public
 sector
 bringing
 people
 together


to
 solve
 those
 problems
 and
 to
 identify


pipelines
 and
 you
 know
 the
 Cape
 Cod


Community
 College
 has
 one
 too.
 They're


training
 aviation
 technology


maintenance.
 they
 have
 a
 new
 uh


relatively
 new
 program
 which
 will
 soon
 I


believe
 be
 the
 biggest
 in
 the
 country


and
 that
 is
 an
 area
 where
 there
 is
 a


skilled
 shortage
 nationally.
 So
 there


are
 shortages
 in
 some
 areas
 and
 there


also
 initiatives
 to
 try
 to
 address
 them


which
 I
 find
 inspiring.
 So
 I
 certainly


take
 your
 point
 obviously
 that
 you
 have


to
 the
 Fed
 has
 to
 be
 or
 ought
 to
 be
 very


mindful
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 inflation
 is


still
 above
 target
 and
 that
 there
 are


scenarios
 even
 if
 they're
 not
 your
 base


case
 we're
 going to
 become
 a
 real


problem.
 That
 being
 said
 you
 know
 at


what
 point
 is
 it
 worth
 cutting
 even
 if


inflation
 is
 above
 target?
 Where
 is
 the


labor
 market
 weakness
 have
 to
 get
 to
 say


you
 know what
 we're
 not
 back
 to
 2%
 but


we
 have
 a
 real
 problem
 on
 the
 labor


market
 side
 that
 that
 becomes
 the


priority.
 So
 there
 clearly,
 as
 I


mentioned
 before,
 there
 clearly
 does


need
 to
 be
 a
 balance
 of
 those
 risks.
 And


so
 I
 do
 think
 about
 how
 far
 each
 of
 our


dualmandated
 goals
 is
 from
 the
 target.


>> And
 so
 if
 the


>> famous
 unemployment
 doesn't
 have
 one


like
 we
 have
 with
 we
 have
 that
 nice
 2%


number
 on
 the
 inflation
 side.


>> Yeah.
 So
 that's
 that
 is
 a
 you
 know
 a


little
 bit
 less
 specifically
 concrete


than
 inflation.
 Absolutely.
 But
 I
 do


think
 that
 we
 have
 a
 sense
 of
 what
 full


employment
 looks
 like.
 And
 you
 know
 this


something
 we
 talked
 about
 as
 part
 of
 the


framework
 review
 that
 was
 completed


recently
 that
 you
 know
 describes
 that
 as


the
 maximum
 employment
 that
 you
 can


sustain
 over
 time
 that's
 consistent
 with


price
 stability.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 a


helpful
 way
 of
 thinking
 about
 it
 because


it
 also
 evolves
 over
 time.
 It's
 not
 just


one
 number.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 appropriate


to
 think
 about
 it
 that
 way.
 So
 if
 we


were
 seeing
 evidence,
 if
 I
 were
 seeing


evidence
 that
 the
 labor
 market
 were


notably
 deteriorating,
 I
 would
 take
 that


very
 seriously
 and
 that
 certainly
 could


justify,
 you
 know,
 near-term
 additional


easing.
 And
 so
 I,
 you
 know,
 careful
 to


kind
 of
 qualify
 my
 statements
 based
 on


what
 I'm
 seeing
 at
 the
 moment
 that
 it
 is


based
 on
 balancing
 risks.
 But
 I
 think


it's
 important
 not
 to
 forget
 about
 the


real
 concerns
 related
 to
 the
 inflation


side
 as
 well
 as
 staying
 very
 attentive


to
 what's
 happening
 on
 the
 labor
 market


side.
 And
 you
 know
 with
 much
 slower


labor
 demand,
 much
 lower
 hiring,
 even


though
 the
 labor
 supply
 growth
 is


clearly
 much
 lower
 as
 well,
 there
 is
 a


risk
 that
 the
 demand
 would
 fall
 well


below
 the
 supply
 growth
 and
 we
 would


start
 to
 see
 more
 notable
 unemployment


increases.
 So
 something
 to
 watch
 very


carefully
 and
 the
 data
 from
 September


that
 we'll
 get
 tomorrow
 is
 helpful.
 you


know,
 the
 initial
 claims
 unemployment,


the
 other
 information
 that
 many
 of
 us


are
 gathering
 and
 looking
 at
 is
 helpful


as
 well,
 but
 you
 know,
 that's
 still
 from


September
 and
 so
 there's
 more


information
 to
 come.
 So,
 one
 thing
 I'm


wondering
 about
 the
 labor
 market
 and
 you


know,
 we've
 heard
 the
 supply
 argument,


um,
 you
 know,
 the
 break
 even
 rate


argument
 from
 a
 number
 of
 Fed
 policy


makers
 at
 this
 point,
 but
 if
 supply
 in


the
 labor
 market
 is
 the
 issue
 here


because
 of
 immigration
 or
 whatever,
 and


it's
 about
 that
 supply
 rather
 than
 a


deterioration
 in
 demand,
 shouldn't
 we


have
 expected
 to
 see
 some
 tightness


showing
 up
 in
 other
 statistics
 like


wages
 earned,


has
 worked
 the
 quits
 rate
 something
 like


that
 and
 we
 haven't
 really
 seen
 that


yet.


>> So
 I
 think
 it's
 both.


>> Okay.


>> Right.
 I
 mean
 the
 fact
 I
 don't
 think
 we


are
 seeing
 significant
 wage
 pressures.


>> I
 think
 that's
 been
 true
 for
 a
 while.
 I


think
 if
 anything
 the
 more
 recent
 data


I've
 seen
 but
 again
 you
 know
 don't
 have


the
 most
 recent
 information
 you
 know
 has


come
 down
 a
 bit.
 It's
 been
 higher
 than


it
 was
 pre-
 pandemic.
 At
 the
 same
 time,


given
 the
 productivity
 that
 we'd
 seen,


that
 is
 consistent
 in
 my
 view
 with,
 you


know,
 with
 with
 price
 stability.
 So,
 I


have
 not
 been
 as
 concerned
 about
 the


labor
 market
 and
 that
 speaks
 to
 both


demand
 and
 supply
 having
 come
 down,


which
 is
 this
 kind
 of
 unusual
 balance


that
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 before.


>> I
 see.


>> But
 looking
 out
 ahead,
 it's
 hard
 to


really
 project
 what
 those
 trajectories


will
 be.
 Will
 the
 labor
 demand
 fall
 more


quickly
 than
 the
 supply
 has
 fallen?
 Then


you'd
 start
 to
 see
 the
 unemployment
 go


up.
 But
 of
 course,
 it
 was
 the
 other
 way


around.
 You
 tend
 to
 see
 more
 wage


pressures.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 AI
 for
 a
 second.
 What


is
 what
 do
 the
 businesses
 that
 you're


talking
 to
 say
 about
 their
 I
 don't
 know


adoption,
 implementation,
 investment
 in


AI?
 I'm
 all,
 you
 know,
 clearly
 it
 feels


like
 everyone
 is
 experimenting


everything.
 It's
 very
 hard
 to
 detect


whether
 there
 are
 obvious
 productivity


gains
 being
 seen
 perhaps
 outside
 of


coding
 and
 engineering.
 What
 are
 they


telling
 you
 about
 their
 sort
 of
 their


budgets
 and
 their
 plans
 for
 adoption
 of


this
 technology?


>> Yeah,
 you
 know,
 so
 if
 I
 think
 back
 even


six
 months,
 it
 was
 a
 a
 kind
 of


interesting
 piece
 of
 the
 conversation


that
 I
 would
 have
 when
 I'm
 meeting
 with


a
 group
 of
 different
 business
 leaders


from
 different
 sectors.
 It's
 now
 a


significant
 share
 of
 the
 conversation


and
 typically
 there's
 not
 one
 of
 the


people
 around
 the
 table
 who
 isn't


telling
 me
 how
 they're
 thinking
 about


it,
 what
 they're
 doing,
 what
 they're


finding.
 It's
 out
 there.
 It's


everywhere.
 And
 that's
 true,
 you
 know.


So,
 I
 was
 not
 too
 long
 ago
 visiting
 a


lumber
 mill
 in
 northern
 Vermont
 and


learned
 about
 how
 they
 have
 been
 using


AI
 in
 order
 to
 sort
 planks
 in
 part


because
 they
 were
 having
 trouble
 hiring


that
 skilled
 labor
 in
 that
 part
 of
 the


country.
 But
 then
 they
 told
 me
 about
 all


of
 the
 other
 benefits
 they
 were
 finding


and
 ways
 that
 they
 were
 teaching
 it
 to


do
 additional
 things.
 I
 hadn't
 expected


going
 to
 a
 lumber
 mill
 that
 we
 were


going
 to
 spend
 quite
 a
 bit
 of
 time


talking
 about
 AI.
 So
 it's
 much
 broader.


I
 am
 hearing
 that
 there
 are
 some
 ways


that
 the
 AI
 is
 really
 supporting
 workers


and
 enabling
 them
 to
 do
 more
 and
 be
 more


focused,
 saving
 time
 in
 terms
 of


reporting
 and
 a
 variety
 of
 different


back
 office
 kinds
 of
 things.
 I
 have
 some


people
 telling
 me
 that
 they
 actually


expected
 it'll
 enable
 them
 to
 grow


because
 of
 some
 of
 the
 savings
 in
 ways


that
 they're
 excited
 about.
 and
 then


others
 that
 are
 telling
 me
 that
 it
 may


be
 enabling
 them
 to
 downsize.
 I
 think


it's
 still
 early
 days
 and
 there
 many


many
 different
 dimensions
 and
 there's


still
 a
 lot
 of
 experimentation
 to
 your


point.
 So
 I'm
 hearing
 all
 of
 it.
 It's


really
 interesting
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 much


too
 early
 to
 tell
 how
 it's
 all
 going
 to


play
 out.


>> I
 hate
 to
 ask
 another
 theoretical


question
 but
 I
 apologize
 in
 advance


because


>> it's
 a
 research.
 We're
 here
 for
 a


research
 conference.


>> Why
 not?
 But
 when
 you
 think
 about
 AI,


does
 it
 make
 you
 think
 about
 the


unemployment
 side
 of
 the
 mandate
 and
 you


know
 the
 policym
 capacity
 at
 the
 Fed?


And
 what
 I
 mean
 by
 that
 is,
 you
 know,


traditionally
 you
 lower
 interest
 rates


if
 you
 want
 to
 try
 to
 boost
 employment


and
 that's
 supposed
 to
 encourage


businesses
 to
 invest
 in
 new
 capital
 and


historically
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 capital
 has


meant
 additional
 jobs,
 although
 we
 can


debate
 automation
 and
 all
 of
 that.
 But


when
 it
 comes
 to
 AI,
 you
 lower
 interest


rates,
 people
 invest
 in
 AI,
 and
 I
 think


the
 concern
 is
 that
 means
 fewer
 jobs.


Now,
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 that
 as


someone
 at
 the
 Fed
 whose
 primary
 tool
 is


the
 benchmark
 rate?
 Lots
 of
 pieces
 to


that
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 thinking
 going
 on,


right?
 So,
 let
 me
 just
 let
 me
 say
 a


couple
 of
 things.
 So,
 I
 do
 think
 that


even
 though
 you
 know
 we're
 mildly


restrictive,
 we
 are
 seeing
 considerable


investments
 across
 a
 wide
 range
 of
 firms


and
 sectors
 in
 AI.
 That
 is
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 firms
 are
 clearly
 leaning


into.
 And
 you
 know
 I
 do
 think
 of
 AI
 as
 a


general
 purpose
 technology
 which
 is
 like


the
 internet
 or
 like
 electricity.
 And
 if


you
 go
 back
 in
 history
 in
 those
 when


those
 were
 being
 adopted
 there
 was
 also


discussion
 that
 introduction
 of
 those


new
 technologies
 was
 going
 to
 you
 know


just
 really
 eliminate
 a
 huge
 number
 of


jobs.
 and
 what
 other
 people
 lighting
 gas


lamps
 who
 are
 going to
 be
 unemployed


electricity


>> and
 gas
 you
 know
 and
 other
 things
 were


developed
 and
 some
 of
 them
 we
 don't


we're
 not
 imagining
 yet
 so
 I
 do
 think


that
 that
 history
 is
 important
 at
 the


same
 time
 it
 does
 seem
 potentially
 like


this
 general
 purpose
 technology
 might


unfold
 more
 quickly
 and
 that
 could


create
 more
 transition
 challenges
 again


it's
 really
 early
 days
 in
 terms
 of


thinking
 about
 how
 that
 may
 play
 out
 but


I
 am
 expecting
 there'll
 be
 new


opportunities
 and
 new
 you
 know
 I
 mean


when
 women
 join
 the
 labor
 market
 the


view
 was
 that
 will
 mean
 there
 were
 no


jobs
 for
 men
 and
 therefore
 you
 know
 and


obviously
 what
 we've
 seen
 is
 a


significant
 increase
 in
 job


opportunities
 vibrancy
 and
 the
 US


economy
 is
 a
 vibrant
 dynamic
 economy
 in


a
 number
 of
 different
 ways
 but
 early


days
 important
 to
 play
 out
 the
 other


thing
 I
 will
 say
 is
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


things
 the
 Fed
 focuses
 on
 and
 cares


deeply
 about
 because
 they
 impact


economic
 conditions.
 They
 impact


employment.
 They
 impact
 inflation.
 We


need
 to
 understand
 them.
 We
 need
 to


follow
 them,
 but
 they
 aren't
 the
 direct


thing
 that
 our
 policy
 tools
 are
 able
 to


influence.
 And
 so,
 I
 think
 we
 need
 to


kind
 of
 recognize
 and
 separate
 those


things.
 You
 know,
 one
 reason
 to
 have,


you
 know,
 eased
 a
 bit
 is
 it
 could


facilitate
 an
 environment
 where
 it's


easier
 for
 labor
 to
 make
 transitions
 to


to
 different
 kind
 of
 areas
 and
 places.


So
 I
 think
 there
 are
 lots
 of


considerations
 there
 but
 again
 this


one's
 going
 to
 unfold
 over
 some
 period


of
 time.


>> You
 know
 one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 mentioned


is
 people
 don't
 just
 care
 about
 the
 rate


of
 inflation
 they
 care
 about


affordability
 overall.
 So
 the
 price


level
 which
 has
 gone
 up
 very


significantly
 and
 one
 segment
 of


people's
 consumption
 basket
 that's
 gone


up
 a
 lot
 in
 several
 years
 the
 cost
 of


housing
 and
 so
 forth.
 And
 this
 is


something
 that
 comes
 up
 from
 time
 to


time,
 which
 is
 that
 rate
 policy
 when
 it


comes
 to
 housing
 can
 sort
 of
 cut
 in


multiple
 directions
 because
 higher


interest
 rates
 might,
 you
 know,
 make


mortgages
 more
 costly
 and
 you
 get
 a


depression
 a
 little
 bit
 in
 demand
 and


maybe
 that
 helps
 balance
 prices.
 On
 the


other
 hand,
 that
 could
 also
 curtail


development
 and
 developers
 are
 very


attuned
 to
 the
 interest
 rates.
 We
 have


seen
 a
 lot
 of
 measures
 of
 housing
 starts


come
 down,
 housing
 activity,
 etc.
 How
 do


you
 think
 about
 getting
 that
 balance


right
 and
 this
 particularly
 given
 the


salience
 of
 residents
 when
 it
 comes
 to


the
 price
 level
 etc.
 How
 do
 you
 think


about
 optimal
 policy
 for
 housing
 supply?


>> Yeah,
 housing
 is
 really
 important
 for
 a


variety
 of
 reasons.
 It
 is
 one
 of
 the


most
 frequent
 concerns
 that
 I
 hear
 not


just
 for
 lower
 moderate
 income,
 right?
 I


mean
 the
 accessibility
 availability
 is


much
 broader
 than
 that.
 So
 you
 know
 it


matters
 in
 terms
 of
 economic
 vibrancy


individuals
 households
 it
 matters
 in


terms
 of
 it
 can
 be
 a
 barrier
 to


participating
 in
 the
 economy
 right
 so
 I


worry
 about
 that
 from
 that
 standpoint
 we


got
 in
 the


>> context
 that
 we're
 in
 now
 with
 real


challenges
 with
 affordability
 and
 there


are
 lots
 of
 statistics
 that
 demonstrate


the
 lack
 of
 housing
 and
 affordability


challenges
 over
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time


and
 it's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 number
 of


different
 groups
 working
 together
 to
 be


able
 to
 really
 address
 them.
 So,
 you


know,
 it
 is
 true
 that
 in
 the
 short
 run


higher
 interest
 rates
 do
 have
 an
 impact.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 of
 course,
 the
 shorter


the
 longer
 term
 rates
 that
 are
 often


relevant
 there
 are
 influenced
 by
 a


number
 of
 different
 factors.
 I
 would
 say


importantly
 guess
 two
 just
 quick
 things.


One
 is
 that
 restoring
 and
 maintaining


price
 stability
 and
 maximum
 employment


creates
 an
 environment
 that's
 really


conducive
 to
 addressing
 our
 housing


challenges
 and
 sustaining
 that


environment,
 that
 infrastructure
 over


time.
 And
 so
 it's,
 you
 know,
 it's


maintaining
 that
 broader
 environment


that
 I
 think
 is
 what
 Congress
 has


charged
 us
 to
 do
 and
 that
 will
 create


that
 environment.
 The
 other
 thing
 is


that,
 you
 know,
 as
 a
 nonpartisan,


trusted
 data
 geekish
 resource,
 the
 Fed


can
 help
 to
 be
 bring
 different
 groups


together
 to
 share
 information
 to
 help
 be


a
 convenor.
 The
 Boston
 Fed
 hosted
 a


conference
 this
 summer
 with
 the
 Harvard


uh
 center
 on
 housing
 studies
 that
 put


out
 their
 annual
 report
 and
 we
 had
 our


colleagues
 from
 eight
 different
 reserve


banks.
 All
 of
 us
 are
 engaged
 and


interested
 in
 working
 in
 our
 communities


to
 support
 addressing
 the
 housing


challenges.
 So,
 it's
 top
 of
 mind
 and


there
 are
 things
 that
 we
 can
 influence


and
 then
 there's
 some
 things
 that
 of


course
 we
 cannot.
 We've
 been
 talking
 a


lot
 about
 the
 economy
 for
 obvious


reasons,
 but
 I
 am
 aware
 that
 we
 are
 in


Boston
 and
 you
 are
 the
 Boston
 Fed


president
 and
 if
 there's
 one
 thing
 I
 do


know
 about
 the
 city
 is
 that
 it
 is
 a


financial
 center.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of


financial
 firms,
 especially
 on
 the
 buy


side
 over
 here.
 Can
 I
 ask
 very
 quickly,


how
 much
 have
 you
 been
 watching
 the


markets
 and
 reflecting
 on
 what's
 been


going
 on
 there?
 Because
 of
 course,
 we've


had
 lots
 of
 talk
 about
 an
 AI
 bubble,


although
 maybe
 some
 of
 the
 air
 has
 been


kicked
 out
 of
 that
 bubble's
 tires
 in


recent
 days
 and
 weeks.
 But
 we
 also
 have


some
 strains
 in
 the
 funding
 markets.
 You


know,
 we've
 seen
 some
 curles
 to
 put
 it


mildly
 in
 repo
 and
 things
 like
 that.
 Are


you
 watching
 those
 as
 well
 as
 what's


happening
 with
 the
 broader
 economy?


>> Absolutely.
 So
 you
 know
 our
 teams
 are


also
 very
 carefully
 watching


developments
 in
 financial
 markets
 and


you
 know
 we
 are
 seeing
 some
 more


volatility
 certainly
 you
 know
 compared


to
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 year
 markets
 are


still
 up
 but
 spreads
 are
 still


relatively
 low
 and
 so
 there
 are
 a
 number


of
 things
 to
 be
 focused
 on
 and
 to
 be


aware
 of
 as
 we
 think
 about
 our
 broader


responsibilities
 and
 charge.


>> All right
 Susan
 Collins
 Boston
 Fed


president.
 We're
 going
 to
 try
 to
 grab


you
 later
 at
 the
 conference
 [laughter]


after
 the
 jobs
 numbers
 come
 out
 and
 see


if
 anything's
 changed.
 But
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 coming
 on
 All
 Bots.
 Really


appreciate
 it.
 A
 pleasure.
 We're


delighted
 you're
 here.


[music]


Joe,
 I
 really
 enjoyed
 that
 conversation.


I
 think
 it
 is
 such
 an
 interesting
 time


to
 be
 talking
 with
 anyone
 on
 the
 Fed.
 I


guess
 I'm
 still
 trying
 to
 wrap
 my
 head


around
 whether
 the
 division
 among
 policy


makers
 currently
 whether
 it's
 about
 how


they
 see
 the
 state
 of
 the
 economy
 right


now
 because
 actually
 there
 does
 seem
 to


be
 a
 lot
 of
 consensus
 like
 the
 labor


market
 is
 deteriorating
 and
 inflation


you
 know
 you
 can't
 deny
 that
 it
 is
 above


target
 or
 whether
 it's
 about
 which
 side


of
 the
 mandate
 they
 want
 to
 emphasize
 or


whether
 it's
 about
 which
 side
 of
 the


mandate
 has
 the
 potential
 to
 get
 out
 of


hand
 basically
 and
 you
 know
 either
 rise


or
 decrease
 exponentially
 the
 inflation


rate
 or
 the
 unemployment
 rate.
 Yeah,
 I


think
 that's
 a
 that's
 a
 very
 good
 way
 of


summarizing
 why
 there
 is
 so
 much
 debate


and
 disagreement
 because
 a
 look
 again


even
 setting
 aside
 the
 data
 blackout


from
 the
 official
 sources
 there's


confusion
 but
 then
 you
 add
 in
 the
 data


blackout
 and
 then
 the
 questions
 about


>> look
 I
 mean
 the
 labor
 market
 r
 the
 risk


to
 the
 labor
 market
 is
 that
 sort
 of


nonlinearity
 right
 that
 you
 get
 an


increase
 and
 then
 an
 increase
 and
 then


an
 increase
 and
 then
 suddenly
 you
 have


very
 severe
 unemployment
 you're
 very
 far


away
 from
 your
 mandate.
 The
 risk
 to
 the


inflation
 is
 that
 yeah,
 as
 as
 Susan
 and


others
 have
 noted,
 they've
 been
 missing


for
 a
 long
 time.
 They're
 still
 not
 back


to
 their
 target.
 Even
 in
 Susan's
 base


case,
 they
 don't
 get
 back
 to
 their


target
 for
 a
 while.
 And
 there
 are


concerns
 about
 something
 more
 deeper


becoming
 embedded.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 very


interesting
 that
 she
 said
 that
 the


contacts
 that
 she
 talked
 to
 have
 been


surprised
 by
 the
 degree
 to
 which
 they


could
 pass
 price
 in
 this
 environment.


And
 so
 yeah,
 very
 easy
 to
 see
 all
 the


different
 ways
 that
 you
 could
 derive


uncertainty.
 Not
 to
 mention
 the
 fact


that
 policy
 itself,
 the
 fiscal
 policy


through
 tariffs
 and
 so
 forth
 remains


uncertain
 there.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 also
 really


interesting.
 She
 was
 talking
 about
 the


idea
 that
 the
 oneoff
 tariff
 price


increase
 can
 take
 some
 time
 to


materialize.
 and
 she
 called
 back
 to
 um


the
 research
 paper
 that
 they're
 going
 to


be
 discussing
 at
 the
 Boston
 Fed
 about


the
 2018
 tariffs
 and
 this
 idea
 that
 even


those
 which
 were
 you
 know
 looking
 back


fairly
 straightforward
 took
 months
 to


actually
 work
 their
 way
 through
 the


economy.
 Now
 we're
 in
 a
 place
 where
 the


tariffs
 you
 know
 they've
 been
 on
 and


then
 they're
 off
 and
 there's
 some


discussion
 about
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


now.
 It
 seems
 likely
 that
 you
 could
 see


that
 those
 would
 take
 even
 longer
 to


work
 their
 way
 through.
 I
 should
 just


say
 we
 are
 going
 to
 be
 releasing
 a


special
 episode
 of
 the
 podcast
 where
 we


talk
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 researchers
 who
 are


presenting
 at
 this
 Boston
 Fed


conference.
 So
 look
 out
 for
 that.
 And


also
 if
 you're
 interested
 the
 Boston
 Fed


will
 actually
 be
 live
 streaming
 this


conference
 so
 you
 can
 follow
 along
 in


real
 time
 on
 Friday
 and
 Saturday
 and


listen
 to
 all
 the
 papers
 actually
 get


discussed.
 Yeah,
 all
 the
 PDFs
 are
 there.


And
 so
 that's
 what
 Tracy
 and
 I
 are
 going


to
 be
 doing
 on
 Friday
 and
 Saturday.


We're
 going
 to
 be
 listening
 to
 speakers.


We're
 going
 to
 be
 reading
 their
 PDFs.


She
 can
 virtually
 join
 with
 us,
 read
 all


the
 PDFs
 yourself
 and
 uh
 talk
 about
 them


in
 the
 Discord
 with
 us.


>> We
 should
 actually
 outsource
 some
 of
 our


work
 and
 just
 ask
 people
 read
 this
 paper


and
 then
 tell
 us
 what
 questions
 we


should
 ask
 about
 it.
 No,
 no,
 no.


>> That's
 what
 you
 had
 GPTs
 for.


>> Yeah.
 All right.
 Well,
 we'll
 be
 in
 a


both
 of
 us
 are
 probably
 going
 to
 be in
 a


Boston
 bar
 in
 the
 next
 day
 or
 so
 eating


beans
 and
 reading
 research
 papers.
 So,


that's
 what
 we'll
 be
 doing.
 Uh,
 shall
 we


leave
 it
 there
 for
 now?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.

 has
 been
 another
