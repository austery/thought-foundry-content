 From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's


the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.


Today's
 Wednesday,
 December
 31st.
 Here's


what
 we're
 covering.


>> I
 have
 a
 severe
 head
 wound.
 Shrapnel


pierced
 my
 central
 nervous
 system.
 Why


haven't
 they
 discharged
 me?


>> The
 Times
 has
 gotten
 access
 to
 more
 than


6,000
 confidential
 complaints
 filed
 by


Russian
 soldiers
 and
 their
 families.


>> They're
 treating
 us
 like
 dogs.
 They
 held


me
 in
 a
 pit
 for
 a
 week
 and
 a
 half.


>> Together,
 they
 show
 how
 Moscow
 has
 used


a
 pattern
 of
 brutality
 and
 coercion
 to


keep
 up
 its
 war
 effort
 in
 Ukraine.


>> He
 can't
 even
 hold
 a
 spoon
 or
 fork,
 and


now
 he's
 being
 sent
 back
 to
 the
 special


military
 operation.


>> My
 colleague
 Paul
 Sony
 is
 part
 of
 the


team
 that
 reviewed
 the
 documents,


including
 those
 excerpts,
 after
 the


whole
 trove
 was
 inadvertently
 put
 online


by
 the
 Russian
 government
 and
 shared


with
 the
 Times
 by
 an
 exiled
 Russian


media
 outlet.
 The
 Times
 then
 tracked


down
 dozens
 of
 people
 who'd
 filed
 the


allegations
 to
 verify
 their


authenticity.


>> Reading
 through
 the
 complaints,
 we
 found


evidence
 of
 people
 being
 sent
 into


battle
 despite
 serious
 injuries
 and


illnesses,
 [music]
 advanced
 cancer,


cerebral
 pausy,
 and
 broken
 and
 missing


limbs.
 One
 of
 the
 videos
 attached
 to
 a


complaint
 shows
 men
 walking
 around
 on


crutches
 as
 they
 are
 allegedly
 being


sent
 into
 battle.


>> [music]


>> We
 also
 found
 evidence
 of
 significant


abuse.
 Soldiers
 who
 were
 beaten
 by
 their


own
 commanders,
 tied
 to
 trees,
 and
 often


held
 in
 really
 inhumane
 conditions.


Among
 the
 thousands
 of
 documents,
 the


most
 disturbing
 allegations
 were


complaints
 that
 [music]
 mentioned
 abna,


which
 is
 a
 practice
 in
 the
 Russian


military
 that
 is
 common
 enough
 to
 have


its
 own
 name.
 And
 it's
 a
 term
 for
 a


commander
 killing
 his
 own
 soldiers,


whether
 executing
 them
 directly
 on
 the


battlefield
 or
 sending
 them
 into
 battle


into
 a
 place
 he
 knows
 they
 won't
 return.


We
 found
 in
 more
 than
 100
 complaints,


threats
 by
 commanders
 to
 kill
 their
 own


soldiers.


When
 you're
 reading
 all
 of
 the


complaints,
 I
 think
 you
 get
 a
 sense
 that


the
 violence
 within
 the
 system
 and
 the


fear
 that
 Russian
 soldiers
 have
 is
 a


feature,
 not
 a
 bug.
 It's
 how
 Vladimir


Putin
 keeps
 his
 soldiers
 on
 the
 attack


in
 Ukraine.


The
 Kremlin
 and
 the
 Russian
 Ministry
 of


Defense
 did
 not
 [music]
 respond
 to


multiple
 requests
 for
 comment.
 You
 can


find
 the
 full
 investigation
 at
 ny


[music]
 times.com.


Now,
 two
 quick
 updates
 from
 Washington.


First,
 the
 Times
 has
 learned
 new
 details


about
 just
 how
 many
 documents
 the


Justice
 Department
 has
 left
 to
 review
 in


the
 Epstein
 files.
 Earlier
 this
 month,


the
 DOJ
 made
 about
 a
 100,000
 pages
 of


files
 related
 to
 its
 investigations
 of


the
 convicted
 sex
 offender
 public
 after


Congress
 ordered
 the
 release.
 The


department
 then
 said
 it
 had
 at
 least
 a


million
 more
 documents
 that
 still
 needed


to
 be
 reviewed.
 Now,
 sources
 tell
 the


Times
 it's
 reviewing
 5.2
 million
 pages


of
 documents.
 The
 DOJ
 is
 trying
 to


enlist
 about
 400
 of
 its
 lawyers
 to
 comb


through
 the
 files
 and
 redact
 any
 details


about
 victims
 or
 other
 sensitive


information.
 The
 process
 is
 expected
 to


take
 until
 at
 least
 January
 20th.


[music]


Also,


>> intrepid
 journalists
 have
 made
 shocking


and
 credible
 allegations
 of
 extensive


fraud
 in
 Minnesota's
 childare
 programs.


Officials
 at
 the
 Department
 of
 Health


and
 Human
 Services
 say
 they
 have
 blocked


$185
 million
 in
 child
 care
 payments
 to


Minnesota
 days
 after
 a
 right-wing


influencer
 posted
 a
 video
 claiming
 to


uncover
 rampant
 fraud
 at
 Somalrun


daycare
 centers
 there.
 While
 none
 of
 the


centers
 in
 the
 video
 have
 been
 accused


of
 fraud
 by
 authorities,
 it
 sparked
 a


new
 wave
 of
 calls
 by
 conservatives
 for
 a


crackdown
 in
 the
 state.
 In
 recent
 years,


dozens
 of
 people
 there,
 many
 [music]
 of


them
 Somali,
 have
 been
 convicted
 in
 a


sprawling
 social
 services
 fraud
 scheme


that
 prosecutors
 say
 cost
 taxpayers


billions
 of
 dollars.
 In
 a
 statement


[music]
 after
 the
 funding
 freeze,
 the


Democratic
 Governor
 Tim
 Walls
 said,


quote,
 "Fraud
 is
 a
 serious
 issue,


[music]
 but
 this
 is
 a
 transparent


attempt
 to
 politicize
 the
 issue
 to
 hurt


motans
 and
 defund
 government
 programs


that
 help
 people.
 [music]


In
 Gaza,
 as
 of
 tomorrow,
 more
 than
 three


dozen
 humanitarian
 groups
 will
 have


their
 authorization
 to
 operate
 in
 the


territory
 suspended
 after
 the
 Israeli


government
 said
 they
 did
 not
 comply
 with


new
 registration
 rules.
 Israel
 says
 the


rules,
 which
 require
 the
 groups
 to


provide
 detailed
 information
 about
 their


workers,
 are
 meant
 to
 weed
 out


militants,
 which
 it
 claims
 have


infiltrated
 aid
 groups
 in
 the
 past.
 But


many
 of
 the
 groups
 have
 objected
 to
 the


requirements,
 saying
 they
 exposed
 their


staff
 to
 risk
 at
 a
 time
 when


humanitarian
 and
 healthcare
 workers
 have


been
 subject
 to
 harassment
 and
 attacks.


Doctors
 Without
 Borders,
 one
 of
 the


groups
 that's
 expected
 to
 be
 suspended


and
 will
 have
 to
 clear
 out
 of
 Gaza
 by


March,
 warned
 that
 there
 would
 be


devastating
 consequences
 for


Palestinians.
 The
 organization
 said
 it


supports
 about
 20%
 of
 all
 hospital
 beds


in
 the
 territory
 and
 the
 delivery
 of
 one


in
 three
 babies
 there.
 Israeli


officials,
 meanwhile,
 argued
 the


suspended
 groups
 are
 not
 critical
 to


providing
 aid
 to
 Gazans,
 saying
 they


only
 supply
 a
 fraction
 of
 the


humanitarian
 assistance
 there.


[music]


>> [music]


>> And
 finally,
 this
 is
 our
 very
 last


episode
 of
 the
 year,
 and
 we
 usually


round
 out
 the
 show
 with
 the
 most
 wa
 I


did
 not
 know
 that
 stories
 that
 the
 Times


is
 covering.
 There
 have
 been
 a
 lot
 of


them.
 So,
 here
 are
 a
 few
 highlights
 as


we
 close
 out
 2025.


What
 if
 I
 told
 you
 that
 there
 is
 a
 13th


zodiac
 sign?
 This
 was
 the
 year
 we


learned
 our
 horoscopes
 might
 all
 be


wrong
 since
 the
 Earth's
 view
 of
 the


stars
 has
 shifted
 over
 the
 last
 2,000


years.
 The
 coating
 [music]
 is
 not


chocolate,
 it's
 chocolate
 flavored


coating.


>> We
 learned
 a
 lot
 of
 people's
 favorite


chocolate
 bars
 aren't
 as
 [music]


chocolaty
 as
 they
 used
 to
 be
 as
 cocoa


prices
 have
 been
 driven
 up
 by
 climate


change.
 We
 also
 learned
 sharks
 can


[music]
 make
 noise.


Even
 though
 scientists
 had
 long
 thought


of
 them
 as
 the
 strong
 silent
 type,


>> um,
 dragons
 [music]
 and
 romance


specifically
 like
 romance
 and
 fantasy.


We
 tracked
 how
 romantic
 has
 become
 the


hottest
 [music]
 literary
 genre
 out
 there


to
 the
 point
 that
 it's
 propping
 up
 the


whole
 fiction
 market.
 We
 checked
 in
 with


people
 trying
 to
 skip
 rocks
 [music]
 the


farthest
 or
 sound
 the
 most
 like


seagulls,
 [screaming]


which
 are
 both
 real
 annual
 competitions


in
 case
 you
 want
 to
 start
 practicing
 now


for
 next
 year.


[cheering]


We
 also
 said
 goodbye
 to
 the
 penny,
 which


is
 no
 longer
 in
 production,
 and
 hello


again
 to
 the
 direwolf,
 which
 scientists


[music]


brought
 back
 from
 extinction.
 And
 there


were
 some
 moments
 of
 really
 solid
 life


advice,
 [music]
 like
 officials
 reminding


people
 not
 to
 ski
 down
 active
 volcanoes,


looking
 at
 you,
 Mount
 Etna,
 and
 a
 timely


bit
 of
 wisdom
 for
 this
 time
 of
 year
 when


health
 officials
 in
 Belgium
 [music]


warned
 people
 not
 to
 eat
 their
 Christmas


trees.
 We
 will
 be
 back
 with
 more
 in


2026.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 [music]
 I'm


Tracy
 Mumford.
 We
 are
 off
 tomorrow.
 The


show
 will
 return
 on
 Friday.
 Happy
 New


Year
 everybody.
