Dr. Li and Dr. Weilong, how did you both end up on 
stage together?
Let me ask, who do you think is better at playing games 
between the two of you?
Definitely him.
How could it possibly be me?
I rarely play games.
Really?
I believe your mind and reflexes are way sharper than 
mine.
I 'm already getting ready to enter my senior years.
Are we really that far apart?
How old are you?
I 'm not even forty yet.
I 'm already fifty-five, almost fifty-six.
Not sixty yet, not sixty yet.
But I hope I can always stay young.
That 's very good.
When I was a kid, I wanted to grow up quickly, but as I 
get older, I hope I do n't age too fast.
I wish time would just stop.
That 's why we always say that health is very important .
Good health will make our days ahead happy and smooth.
So today is also a kind of intergenerational 
conversation.
I 'll draw first, then.
Wei Long, can you help us draw one first?
Respecting the elderly and honoring the wise, right?
It 's the heart.
You drew the heart.
I have to put it in first, right?
I need to be very careful because I do n't want to get 
penalized.
Does this count as a success?
Success
When people think of the heart, they usually wonder 
what it 's afraid of.
Most would think it 's afraid of oily foods or high 
cholesterol.
That 's correct—this idea is right.
But in fact, besides cholesterol and fats, the heart is 
also afraid of other things.
There are other things it 's even more afraid of.
Why?
Because, as we learn in medicine, when certain 
substances are too high, they can cause inflammation in our
bodies.
This includes inflammation of the blood vessels.
It 's like a drainage ditch: if the walls of the ditch 
are very smooth, then even if there are lots of weeds
or silt flowing through, everything can pass smoothly.
But if the walls of the ditch are uneven, then even a 
small amount of weeds can easily get stuck and cause a
blockage.
So, if our blood sugar is too high, the blood vessel 
walls become inflamed and uneven.
As a result, even if our cholesterol is n't very 
high—just a little elevated—it can easily accumulate there,
leading to blocked blood vessels.
This is what we often talk about.
Cardiovascular diseases like myocardial infarction or 
stroke.
So in fact, what the heart fears more is high blood 
sugar.
According to statistics on abdominal health, once you 
are diagnosed with diabetes, your risk of coronary
heart disease is double that of the general population .
And if you are a diabetic and develop coronary artery 
disease, your mortality rate is four times higher than
that of the general population.
That 's why we need to pay even more attention to 
controlling blood sugar.
Paying attention to cholesterol is one of the keys to 
preventing cardiovascular disease.
I 've prepared a simple guide to balancing 
cholesterol—click the button at the top right now to get it
immediately.
So, how was my explanation?
Was it okay?
It was pretty impressive.
So, that means you have to be punished by drawing a 
truth card.
This is the main point.
Alright, let me draw a card.
This question is—
Which is harder, being a doctor or being a dad?
Wow, this is a tough question to answer.
At this stage, is it harder for me to be a father or a 
doctor?
I think being a dad is harder.
Actually, I feel that being a doctor and being a dad 
are somewhat similar in certain ways.
For example, when we—
What I mean is, we accompany our clients or patients 
from a state of aging, deterioration, or
illness—sometimes even approaching death—and we help 
bring them back to a healthy or strong condition where
they can live independently again.
And as a father, or in the role of a dad, you 're 
accompanying your child from a more immature, naive stage,
helping them grow strong, become independent and 
self-reliant, so that they can enjoy their own lives, and
even surpass our generation.
So I feel that, in a way, the roles of doctor and 
father are very similar—they 're both about being there,
accompanying someone.
Supporting them.
Right.
Exactly, or guiding them.
And I 've noticed another phenomenon.
For example, in our clinic, when we see a patient, 
maybe after two or three weeks, or a month, they come back
and they 've lost a lot of weight.
We all feel, wow, that 's a big change.
My blood test results have become really, really good.
We encourage them, praise them, but with children, they 
're always by our side.
After spending so much time together, it becomes really 
hard to carefully notice their growth, changes, or
maturity over a long period.
So what we tend to notice more are the things we think 
are deviations or problems.
... the things they did n't do well ,
or the things they could n't figure out.
At these times, your praise, encouragement, guidance, 
or companionship might not be as much, and instead, you
tend to magnify their shortcomings.
So I think, as parents or guardians, sometimes it 's 
really hard.
That 's right.
I completely agree, one hundred percent.
Just like Teacher Li mentioned earlier, sometimes when 
we spend every day with our own children, it 's not
easy to notice their strengths or progress.
What we tend to see are their shortcomings.
And of course, as fathers, we always hope that ... Good 
is never enough—we always want them to be even better
So, in your heart, you always feel like they 're still 
not doing well enough.
Right.
So I often have this feeling: when we 're accompanying 
our patients, our rational side tends to outweigh
our emotional side
But when it comes to being a father, maybe emotion 
outweighs reason.
That 's why, as the ancients often said, 'teaching with 
just a finger'.
When we are accompanying our own children, it 's 
actually very difficult for us to take an encouraging or
praising perspective—we always want them to do well.
Of course, from another angle, it 's because we want 
the best for our children, so it 's hard for us to
praise them.
But I think Dr. Li can probably relate: when your child 
achieves something, you actually feel moved and happy
inside, but sometimes it 's just hard to say words of 
praise out loud.
Yes, we always want to say something more, hoping they 
can make even more progress.
Right, so I think this is something that also requires 
practice.
Actually, even though this honest answer was given to 
Dr. Li, I want to echo it—I personally also feel that
being a father is a thousand times harder than being a 
doctor.
Maybe even ten thousand times harder.
Alright, let me draw a card first.
This one is the kidney.
This one.
This is our kidney.
Where are the kidneys located?
Oh no, you ’ re in trouble.
You ’ ll have to go back and study medicine all over 
again.
Because the kidneys are hidden in the deeper part of 
the posterior abdominal cavity, so they ’ re a bit
deeper.
Okay, no problem.
What are the kidneys afraid of?
I think the kidneys are afraid of three words: Donald 
Duck.
What do you mean?
Donald Duck means, first, sugar—blood sugar.
In Taiwan, we ’ re actually a kingdom of dialysis.
The incidence rate of people undergoing dialysis in 
Taiwan is the highest in the world.
If you look more closely at our fellow citizens who are 
on dialysis, they ...
A large proportion of them have diabetes.
For example, the 2021 annual report on kidney disease 
in Taiwan pointed out that as many as 46.5 % of people
on dialysis have diabetes.
That figure, nearly 47 %, is extremely high, especially 
among men—almost half of them have diabetes.
If we look back to the year before they started 
dialysis, what happened then?
The proportion of people whose primary diagnosis was 
diabetes was also around 46 % to 47 %.
That 's all.
These numbers are really shocking.
Yes, and especially, the older a person is when they 
start dialysis, the higher the proportion of diabetes.
What does this mean?
It means that if our kidneys are soaked in a sugary 
environment for a long time, the extent of damage they
suffer will become more and more severe.
Take the kidneys, for example—they 're structured like 
a water filter, filtering out some of the unwanted
metabolic waste while retaining what the body needs.
But if this filter is soaked in sugary water for a long 
time, the tiny filters inside, like the glomeruli,
may become hardened, damaged, or aged.
Naturally, this will affect their filtering function.
As the damage slowly progresses and kidney function 
starts to decline, dialysis becomes necessary.
So I believe diabetes is very closely related to our 
kidneys.
Just like Dr. Weilong mentioned earlier, the heart is 
most afraid of high blood sugar and diabetes—the same
goes for the kidneys.
This is something we often tell our patients in the 
clinic: 'If I do n't control my blood sugar now, I do n't
feel anything wrong.
Right now, if I do n't lose weight, I do n't feel 
anything either.
But over time, what you should really worry about is 
that these vital organs—whether it 's your heart—
Oh, it 's very dirty, and then the bathroom—without 
even mentioning the liver—these vital organs are actually
all easily affected.
That 's a major reason why we need to control blood 
sugar and improve our health.
As for aging, that 's the key word here.
It means that many of your lifestyle habits can cause 
your kidneys to age much faster.
Let me give a simple example.
Most office workers tend to sit for long periods, drink 
little water, and often have sugary drinks.
Sometimes, when they get busy, we even hold in our 
urine, sometimes only going to the bathroom after
finishing work.
Holding in urine can cause significant infections or 
strain on the urinary tract and kidneys.
So just from these habits, you ’ re already hitting 
four risk factors.
If you also stay up late binge-watching shows, snack 
while watching, or have a little alcohol, these
lifestyle habits make your body prone to inflammation, 
which in turn accelerates kidney aging.
That ’ s why I think these everyday habits are the main 
reasons why kidneys age and deteriorate so quickly.
The third 'pressure' actually refers to high blood 
pressure.
As we ’ ve mentioned, both blood sugar and blood 
pressure are really harmful to the body.
Just imagine your kidneys as a water filter that ’ s 
constantly under high pressure for a long time.
The pipes in that filter will harden or narrow much 
earlier, just like what happens in the heart.
The amount of water the filter can process will 
gradually be affected, so the kidneys will also be impacted.
Once damage begins, kidney function declines even more 
easily.
Most people might think that eating too much salt is 
the main issue.
Exactly, and just now Dr. Li mentioned something I 
completely agree with—because these conditions often have
no symptoms at all.
So for us ,
easy people to overlook.
This is what we call a silent disease in the metabolic 
syndrome group—there are basically no symptoms or
sensations.
But by the time you actually feel something, it 's 
already very serious.
Like with your kidneys—when they 're damaged, in 
advanced stages of kidney disease, or when you need dialysis
you might not feel anything.
That 's right.
So, our organs are actually working really hard for us 
but you do n't notice it.
They 're constantly coping with your condition, and by 
the time you feel something, it 's already very
serious.
Serious.
So remember, it 's really important to get regular 
health checkups.
Oh, he got it right—do I have to draw now?
Yes.
So, next up, we have.
Hmm, do you ever feel like society ...
... has standards for body shape that are too strict?
Uh, I think I 'm really suited to answer this question .
Because as everyone knows, I used to be overweight.
I 'm not very tall, and at my heaviest, I was about 85 
kilograms.
So at that time, my body fat percentage was really high 
around 34 or 35, and of course, my BMI was way over
the standard.
Back then, the thing I worried about most was buying 
clothes, especially pants.
Because for shirts, like T-shirts, I could just buy a 
larger size and it would be fine.
But buying pants was really tough for me, and I had to 
muster up the courage, because I could n't find pants
that fit my waist size.
Your size does n't exist
Right, or even if I could find it, I had to buy an 
extra-large size and then get it shortened.
So back then, buying clothes was actually a source of 
stress for me.
So, does society have any special expectations for 
people who are overweight?
It 's not exactly a requirement, but maybe you just 
feel something in your own mind.
Invisible pressure
Right, and there 's another thing that really struck me .
Back then, sometimes when I took
the MRT had just started operating ,
the seats on the MRT were okay, but on the bus, since 
the seats are for two people, if I sat down, the person
next to me might feel a bit
pressured.
Hmm, maybe the person next to you does n't actually 
feel that way, but you end up putting pressure on
yourself.
You 're afraid people will look at you negatively, 
right?
So at that time, the psychological pressure was 
actually quite heavy.
I—I can also share an experience from my past.
Back when I was working at a hospital, I weighed over 
ninety kilograms.
At that time, the hospital elevator was really hard to 
get into.
And every time the elevator made that overweight 
warning sound, you could n't help but think of yourself.
You 'd take a look at yourself.
You 'd just voluntarily step out.
Later on, I stopped taking the elevator altogether 
because I felt so much pressure.
Or, when there were only two or three spots left in the 
elevator, you 'd wonder whether you should get in or
not—maybe if you got in, the alarm would go off.
So eventually, I decided to just take the stairs.
And this kind of thing is actually very common, whether 
in Taiwan, among Chinese people, or in Asia in
general.
For example, I once saw a study that said Japanese 
women ...
One fifth of them are actually underweight.
Oh, so
it ’ s possible that part of the reason is because our 
society, especially towards women, places excessive
emphasis on body shape ,
so it makes them
or, whether it ’ s this or that, the overall social 
atmosphere causes them to become like this.
And this situation, in turn, can lead them into a state 
that isn ’ t so healthy physically.
They might end up being relatively underweight, 
accompanied by these persistent health issues.
metabolic problems.
A couple of days ago in the clinic, I had a very 
memorable experience with a friend who was coming in for a
follow-up on weight loss.
When he came in, he immediately apologized to me, 
saying that he had eaten recklessly while traveling abroad
this time and that his weight had n't gone down.
He was putting a lot of pressure on himself, but 
honestly, I do n't think there 's any need to put that kind
of pressure on yourself.
It 's normal not to always make steady progress, and 
even to hit plateaus sometimes.
Exactly, and what we 're really talking about is a 
healthy weight, body shape, and body composition.
It 's not necessarily the number on the scale or your 
outward appearance that determines your overall
condition.
Right?
Seriously, I often say this: I 'd rather we do things 
at 80 % but keep it up for a lifetime, than go all out
at 100 % for just two months.
Exactly.
I believe it 's the same for lawyers in clinics—it 's 
tough, right?
So, shall we move on to the next question?
No, next up is the surprise round.
A surprise round, huh?
That 's a lot of pressure.
Oh wow.
I just swore, did n't I?
Could n't catch it.
Nope.
Two sticks.
Looks like you must be from an even older generation 
than me, your gaming skills are so bad.
I have no idea how to play, I do n't even know what I 
'm supposed to catch.
Alright, then you have to be punished by drawing a 
truth question.
I 'll answer a question.
Which should I pick?
Wait, wait a second.
Let 's not follow the editor 's rules.
You draw a question from my set—it might be more ...
Special.
Will there be traps in there.
No, instead of comparing
If you were n't a medical doctor, what kind of 
professional job would you ideally do?
It 's quite interesting
This is quite genuinely interesting.
If I were n't a doctor, I 'd probably want to seriously 
consider becoming a chef.
Chef
Chef.
Whether or not it 's as a chef, just the act of cooking 
or being in the kitchen is actually a great form of
self-care.
That is to say, from getting to know the ingredients, 
preparing the food, to sharing it with your family and
friends, it 's actually something very healing for both 
body and mind.
I become completely focused and very calm.
Ah, this state of mindfulness is n't something that 's 
easily achieved by doing other things.
So I really enjoy this process.
The second thing I later realized is that cooking 
allows me to continuously release a lot of healthy dopamine
Creating these healthy and delicious dishes actually 
gives me a great sense of satisfaction.
And when you see your family eating it, or when your 
children are enjoying it, you feel a real sense of
accomplishment, because they also feel very satisfied 
and happy.
I think this kind of dopamine is very healthy and 
long-lasting.
Even though you drew this question, I really want to 
answer it because I felt very touched after reading it.
What does Weilong want to be?
What I want to be even more is a fashion designer.
Design.
Designer—because I like designing women 's bags and 
clothes.
So, if you know me or are close friends with me, you 'd 
know that my room used to be filled with GQ and all
kinds of women 's fashion magazines.
I really love those things because I think they 're so 
beautiful.
So, if I were n't a doctor, I would really love to do 
this job.
Let me share a little secret: my wife is actually my 
former girlfriend.
When she went shopping for clothes, most guys do n't 
like accompanying their significant other to shop, but I
really enjoyed it.
I loved it, because I got to help her pick out stylish 
outfits, see her wear them, and that feeling gave me a
real sense of accomplishment.
That sounds impressive!
Next time, Wei Long should share his experience too.
Alright.
If one day you find out that I 've stopped seeing 
patients, it means I 've gone off to become a designer.
Then soon we 'll see you on the runway of some 
international fashion show.
I hope so!
If that happens, I ’ ll definitely collaborate with 
Churi Medical—combining weight loss and fashion.
That sounds like a great plan.
In this episode, we talked a lot with Organ Pa, 
covering everything from Organ Pa himself to our views on
life and careers.
I feel like I gained a lot from this conversation—it 
was fantastic.
So, the next person I want to call on is the 41st 
Division.
Come and talk to us about what organs are afraid of.
Then I 'll call on our Kaohsiung 's rising star, the 
most beautiful female doctor, Dr.
Fan, okay, great.
So we 're looking forward to Dr.
Fan and the driver having a discussion about what 
organs are afraid of.
Audience friends, you can look forward to it.
