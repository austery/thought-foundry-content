The first anniversary of Xinqingan’s launch on the road
Many people are asking, has residential justice been achieved?
Why many young people still can’t afford a house
House prices were pushed up instead
<font color=#FEFF00FF>May Xinqingan Housing Loan</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>accounted for 40.6% of the new mortgage loans of the five major banks</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>is the highest in the past 8 years</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>New Youth Security Plan</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>I personally describe it as giving amphetamine to the new youth</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>That is, when housing prices are high</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>You take incentives</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>The housing market was originally going to cool down</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Becomes another tail flick</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Li Tongrong believes that Xinqing'an has attracted more than 30% of false demand to intervene</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Push up housing prices</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>It is not easy to check the head count</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>I’m afraid it will distort the market mechanism</font>
The book I’m going to introduce today is “The Uninhabited Island”
To discuss the issue of residential injustice in Taiwan
The author of this book, Liao Tinghui, is a researcher at the Social Housing Promotion Alliance
This book takes a historical perspective
Exploring the history of Taiwan’s residential movement over the past 30 years
Analyze the root causes of Taiwan’s high housing prices
Clarify the reasons why residential justice cannot be achieved
Finally, we propose Taiwan’s future reform blueprint.
Taipei City’s house price-to-income ratio over the past 40 years
It has been soaring since 2006
It will be 15 times by 2023
It takes 15 years of no food and drink to afford a house
In contrast
What the World Bank considers to be a reasonable housing price-to-income ratio
is less than 5 times
Builders shout all day long that high housing prices are due to rigid demand
But according to statistics from the Ministry of Finance
Of the 520,000 new residential buildings built in Taiwan in the past six years, 53% are for non-owners.
It can be seen that the cost of housing ownership in Taiwan is very low
You can have several rooms
<font color=#FEFF00FF>There are 851,000 vacant houses in Taiwan in 2023, and the vacancy rate is 9.33%</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>The vacancy rate in all counties and cities in Taiwan except Lianjiang County has increased</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>If we look at the vacancy rate in the six capitals</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Kaohsiung has 10% and Tainan has more than 9%, accounting for the top two of the six cities</font>
There are so many new houses
Not for living in
It's used for real estate speculation.
This makes the statement that "high housing prices are due to rigid demand" self-defeating.
High housing prices are not due to rigid demand
It comes from investment needs
But every time the government encounters housing price problems
Let’s just say: Taiwan’s residential ownership rate is 85%, and every household has a house.
but if that's really the case
Everyone should be happy that house prices are rising.
Because your assets have increased in value
But according to the analysis of Professor Hua Changyi from the Institute of Urban and Rural Affairs of National Taiwan University
The composition of households in Taiwan is
60% own one house
10% are economically disadvantaged
20% are young people who cannot afford a house
The last 10% are homeowners with more than two bedrooms
Among them, the largest 60% of households are the group of people who feel the most conflicted
They have their own house
But seeing that their children cannot afford a house
So I hope the price won’t be too high
But on the other hand
Because I have a house
So I'm afraid that house prices will fall.
Your assets have shrunk.
So whenever people want to reform housing policies
A small number of 10% of the real estate class can create panic in public opinion
Let a majority of 60% oppose the reform
Over the years
It forms a kind of real estate cultural hegemony.
Constantly instill in the public a concept that "real estate can only rise, not fall."
There are various sayings that "buying a house is the best investment tool"
Cultural hegemony means
You don't realize there's power behind the scenes
I thought it was natural
Because it has already penetrated into the public’s thinking
Let’s just take this as common sense
For example, investment in buying a house is included in elementary school textbooks in Taiwan.
Teach children how to speculate in real estate from an early age
Give real estate speculation cultural legitimacy
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Social studies textbook for sixth grade elementary school</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>It actually teaches children about real estate speculation</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>That’s what is written in this text</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>When house prices are relatively low</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>You should buy first</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Then take advantage of the price increase</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Sell the house and make a profit</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Teaching children as young as primary school students to speculate in real estate</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Not quite right</font>
Housing issues in Taiwan today
has become a generational exploitation problem
The properties are all occupied by the older generation
Cut young people like leeks
But young people’s incomes are lower than those of previous generations
Research findings by Taiwanese sociologist Lin Zonghong
Taiwanese born before 1978
Enjoy the fruits of post-war economic growth
High salary growth
In contrast
Generations born after 1978
After leaving society, the salary growth curve dropped a lot.
If inflation is taken into account
The wages of young people have actually shrunk.
Lower wages for younger generations
But housing prices are being pushed higher by the older generation
To buy a house
Young people have to bear large mortgage loans
I use my salary to pay off the mortgage.
There is no money to spend
No one buys the product
It will cause a depression in all industries
Let Taiwan's economy worsen
As a result, many young people are afraid to have children
So the housing price issue actually involves more than just housing.
It will also create a national security crisis involving generational antagonism, economic depression, and declining birth rate.
How did Taiwan end up in this situation today?
Next we will review
The history of housing movement in Taiwan over the past half century
Understand the historical roots of high housing prices
After the war, the Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan
With the influx of 2 million immigrants, Taiwan's population increased by one-third
But the government at that time advocated counterattack on the mainland
There is no need to deal with housing issues
I think these immigrants will be able to return to China soon.
Until Typhoon Keti invaded in 1953
many people homeless
The government just used US aid funds to build 8,500 new homes.
This typhoon unexpectedly led to the starting point of Taiwan’s housing policy
The American consultant stationed in Taiwan at the time (Hugo V Bmeha) insisted on formulating housing policies
The Taiwan government only formulated the new national residential loan regulations in 1957.
125,000 homes built
By the 1970s
Taiwan's economy takes off
Massive population flows into cities
The private housing market develops
From 1957 to 1968, the number of dwellings increased by 275,000
However, Taiwan’s population increased by 3.96 million
Supply cannot keep up with demand
Causing housing prices to soar
In 1966, the price of a new apartment in Taipei was NT$3,700 per ping.
Two years later it rose to 7,500 yuan
Plus the two oil crises in the 1970s
rising prices
In order to stabilize the people's hearts, the government proposed 12 major construction projects
One of them is to build a new national residence
The goal is to build 600,000 households in 10 years
Before 1980
The rise in housing prices in Taiwan is indeed due to rigid demand
Because a large number of people are crowded into cities
Demand for housing far exceeds supply
But after the 1980s
This argument does not apply
There is no significant increase in population in metropolitan areas
But house prices have skyrocketed
Why?
Because of the neoliberal policies implemented during the Reagan administration in the United States in the 1980s
Call for Taiwan to open up its markets and liberalize
So in 1987
President Chiang Ching-kuo announced the lifting of foreign exchange controls
A large amount of capital flows into Taiwan's stock market and real estate market
In addition, Taipei announced in 1987 that it would build an MRT.
Housing prices across Taiwan have skyrocketed for three consecutive years.
<font color=#FFE300FF>"0099 Great Fortune" (1989)</font>
But the government only wants to support the real estate market
Start promoting a statement
Everyone must know how to invest and manage money
To be able to afford a house
Being unable to afford a house is not a government policy issue
It's your personal problem
It happened to be after the lifting of martial law in 1987
People can now take to the streets to protest
1988
Several elementary school teachers and teachers and students from National Taiwan University's Institute of Urban and Rural Affairs launched the "Shellless Snail Movement"
Form a "Solidarity Organization for the Helpless"
Published the "Snail Doctrine Manifesto"
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Housing is part of basic human rights</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Not a product</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Not a bargaining chip in a money game</font>
Protest against the commodification of housing
Ask the government to enact rent controls, impose an empty home tax, and build new public housing
August 26, 1989
The maximum number of people staying overnight on Zhongxiao East Road reached 50,000
<font color=#FFEC00FF>My relatives and friends all think I have been exiled</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Because I can hardly rent any house in Taipei City</font>
Demonstrators performed the Monopoly dance in a humorous and satirical way
Polls show that more than 70% of people support
The media is also overwhelmingly supportive of this movement.
Why?
Because the shellless snail movement is not aligned with any political party
Therefore, it is regarded as the new source of street movement after the lifting of martial law.
The Executive Yuan’s response at that time was
Avoid house price tax issues
And advocates subsidies and expansion of housing loans
In fact, it is about turning those who cannot afford a house into qualified consumers.
Instead of facing the problem of high housing prices
Sociologist Xiao Xinhuang believes that
The shellless snail movement has an 'apolitical character'
This is the reason for its success and the reason for its failure
Because I don’t cooperate with any political party
There is no way to obtain more political resources
This was also the later residential justice policy
a key to success
In addition, the appeal of sports during this period was still very rough.
The emphasis is on making housing affordable for the public
Pursuing home ownership
Until after the Asian financial crisis in 1997
Taiwan’s housing movement has only shifted from the pursuit of ownership to the pursuit of residency
In the 1990s, the number of households in Taiwan increased rapidly
From 5.6 million people in 1994 to 6.2 million people in 1997
The average number of housing transactions per year is 482,000
This is the four-year period with the largest number of housing transfers in Taiwan’s history.
Housing market is hot
House prices also rose
<font color=#FBFF00FF>In 1980, the average asking price per square meter in Taipei City was 76,000</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>By 1990, it reached 267,000 yuan</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>It has nearly quadrupled in just 10 years</font>
But because during this period
Labor income also increased
The average household disposable income increased from 460,000 to 860,000
So people can still afford housing prices
Until 1997
Asian financial crisis hits Taiwan
Stock and housing markets plummet
People’s willingness to buy houses decreases
At that time, all the well-known builders had problems with turnover.
Sancai Construction's stock price fell to the limit
At that time, the Construction Investment Union told the Executive Yuan
"Unsaleable houses will cause the construction industry to collapse and impact Taiwan's economy."
Executive President Xiao Wanchang accepts the demands of builders
Adopt 150 billion preferential housing loan program
This is the first time the Taiwanese government has compiled a budget for housing loans.
On the surface, it is to help people from low- and middle-income households obtain loans to buy houses.
But in fact, it is to save the housing market that is on the verge of collapse.
As soon as this policy came out, it immediately triggered a backlash from academic circles and the public.
The real estate crash happened because housing prices were raised too high by builders
As a result, taxpayers' money is now being used to help them out.
It has evolved into a situation where house prices can only rise but not fall.
As long as housing prices fall, the government will come out to protect the market and rescue the market.
Social movement groups were dissatisfied and organized into the "Shellless Snail Alliance"
Take to the streets to protest every week
At this time, the main demand of the Shellless Snail Alliance is no longer the ownership of the house.
Instead, turn to residency
Ask the government to develop rental housing rental subsidies
under pressure
The Executive Yuan has just begun to list "Land and Housing Policy" as the theme of its meetings
At that time, the Shellless Snail Alliance proposed that "rental expenses can be tax deducted"
But the Ministry of Finance refused and said that most countries do not have such a system.
In August 1999, the Shellless Snail Alliance organized an overnight stay on Zhongxiao East Road
All five presidential candidates showed up and pledged
Publicly sign checks in support of housing policy
Unexpectedly, less than a month
The September 21st earthquake happened
Both the government and the public are turning their attention to assisting the reconstruction of disaster-stricken areas.
The accident halted the housing movement
It wasn’t until 2000 that Taiwan’s first political party rotation
At the inauguration ceremony of 520 Chen Shui-bian
The Shellless Snail Group arrived with the letter of commitment signed by Chen Shui-bian before the election.
Remind the DPP not to forget its pre-election promises
As early as 1993
The DPP proposes a fair and just welfare state
One of the ten major social welfare propositions is the housing policy of "everyone has a house to live in"
But in the early days of Chen Shui-bian's administration
This coincided with the economic downturn and rising unemployment rate after the September 21 earthquake.
The government launches preferential housing purchase loans to maintain the economy
From 2000 to 2005, a total of 1.8 trillion loan interest subsidies were set
Continuing to increase the amount of housing loans for young people, there is no need to think deeply about housing policies
At that time, the draft of the "Residential Law" was drafted by Hua Jingqun, a professor at the Department of Land Affairs of NCTU.
I was blocked all the time and didn't go to the Legislative Yuan for trial.
The then Executive President Zhang Junxiong said
"We must consider the needs of young people, but we must also consider the boost to the overall real estate industry."
<font color=#FBFF00FF>200 billion housing loan discount</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Assisted 47,000 families to realize their desire to buy a house as soon as possible</font>
Although the "Residential Law" bill did not pass the third reading
But on the initiative route
However, it provides sufficient discussion resources
Housing groups no longer just criticize high house prices
Instead, they ask for the right to reside.
Like abolishing the single discrimination clause
Taking care of vulnerable groups
Subsidized student rental housing
And most importantly social housing
This further lays the foundation for the next stage
Discussion on residential justice during Ma Ying-jeou’s administration
In 1998, Peng Huainan became president of the central bank.
implement low interest rate policy
To support export-oriented industries
Mortgage interest rates from Taiwan’s five major banks
From 8.3% in 1998 to 1.79% in 2010
A lot of money flows into real estate
Significantly pushed up house prices
It can be said that the Taiwan government’s low interest rate policy is to provide preferential treatment to exporters.
Instead, it caused housing prices to skyrocket.
Taipei’s house price-to-income ratio has increased from 6 times in 2002
Soared to 12 times that of 2010
It's tripled
In 2009, an online poll recognized the top ten complaints among the public as high housing prices.
This happened to be the period when Ma Ying-jeou was in power.
He must deal with the problem of soaring housing prices as soon as he takes office.
There was a key figure in promoting housing policy reform during this period.
Peng Yangkai
Served as director of OURs (Organization for Urban Reform) since 2006
Shift initiative focus to housing policy, social housing
Because raising housing prices involves too large an interest structure, it is difficult to shake it.
Social housing is relatively easy to get support for
So in March 2010
They are located in Section 2, Renai Road, Taipei City
Issue a self-rescue declaration for shellless snails
Point out that housing is a basic human right
The state must guarantee the realization of this right
Ask the government to push forward the Housing Act
Increase social housing stock
At this time, housing groups no longer work alone.
Instead, it forms an alliance with social welfare groups
Form a Social Housing Promotion Alliance
Referred to as "Zumimeng"
Because at that time, the public in Taiwan did not know enough about social housing.
Housing Alliance invited Dr. Jeroen van der veer, a Dutch social housing expert.
Came to Taiwan for many exchanges
and take advantage of the opportunity before the election.
Visited candidates Hao Longbin and Su Zhenchang who were running for mayor of Taipei at that time
And New Taipei City candidate Tsai Ing-wen
Lobby them to include social housing as a political issue in the five cities.
The Democratic Progressive Party will use this to win the election.
Questioning Hao Longbin for not building any social housing in the past four years
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Where is Su Zhenchang, the Taipei mayoral candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Today we talked about the concept of social housing</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>He was the first to bring it up</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>He also criticized his opponent Hao Longbin for only following up now</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>It's basically a first aid chapter</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>However, Hao Longbin responded</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>The municipal government has complete supporting measures for social housing</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>In addition, there is now the endorsement of the central government</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>So this check can be cashed within 4 years</font>
Why has social housing, which only focuses on disadvantaged groups, suddenly become an electoral focus?
At that time, Taiwan had just weathered the 2009 financial tsunami, and the unemployment rate had increased by 5%.
Young people have a strong sense of relative deprivation
And for political parties
Supporting social housing is actually an alternative to avoiding the problem of high housing prices
Because it won’t block the builder’s financial path
On May 1st Labor Day in 2011
Housing groups join May Day anti-poverty march
Six thousand people took to the streets to protest in front of Emperor Bao
Ask the government to build social housing, pass housing laws, and register at real prices
Hopefully before the 2012 presidential election
Put pressure on the ruling party
Ally with opposition parties
And it worked
DPP releases ten-year political platform "housing chapter"
Drafted by Hua Jingqun, bringing in progressive ideas
The goal is to have Taiwan’s social housing stock reach 10% of the overall housing stock.
Declare to the people that the DPP will do better than the KMT
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Residential, after all, its most fundamental essence is still residential use</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>That is, we should return housing to the essence of people’s livelihood needs</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Focus on consumption and curb speculation</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>We do see such a direction in the policies of the Democratic Progressive Party</font>
Faced with the challenges of the Democratic Progressive Party’s platform and the pre-election pressure of 2012
Ma Ying-jeou's government asks Legislative Yuan Wang Jinping to quickly negotiate on the housing law
Passed quickly the next day
In this way, the housing movement has been working hard for 20 years
Finally, in 2011, Taiwan had its first housing law.
It is expressly stipulated that the government should protect the right to residence
After the legislation is passed
2012 presidential election
The Kuomintang retained power
Ma Ying-jeou re-elected
But even if the housing law is passed
House prices are still soaring
Ma government officials have made scandals
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Director of Construction Ye Shiwen attended the private forum on the 7th</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Blurted out that investing in the stock market will result in loss</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Real estate is the best investment</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF> also said that before 2016, there will be no tax on the actual price</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Let scholars and experts criticize Ye Shiwen for his gaffe and dereliction of duty</font>
The Building and Construction Department's statement is tantamount to openly encouraging everyone to speculate in real estate.
Exposing the government’s lies about achieving residential justice
People's anger rises again
In May 2014, the nest movement was launched
Renai Road, which had the highest housing prices in Taipei at the time, was chosen as the starting point for the parade.
The initiative line at this time is no longer just about protesting against high housing prices.
Instead, we ask the government to protect the right to residence.
On the night of the nest luck event, thousands of people stayed overnight in Dibao
Taipei mayoral candidate Ke Wenzhe also attended to support
Call out the pre-election check for 20,000 households in 4 years
Chaoyun Group also directly named the top ten legislators with the largest number of properties.
<font color=#FBFF00FF>The number one legislator in real estate is Zhang Qingzhong of the Kuomintang</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>There are 143 pens at the bottom</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>The second place is DPP legislator Xue Ling with 77 entries</font>
Under the pressure of nest luck
Ma Ying-jeou's government promises to propose a combined real estate and land tax as soon as possible
But the result was only reform of the real estate transaction tax
rather than a hoarding tax
Before the bill was passed
People from the Builders Association also went to meet with the Chief Executive and the Minister of Finance
I hope they relax the tax regime
As a result, the version passed in 2015 became tailor-made for builders
The income tax required to pay for the combined real estate and land tax is less than the luxury tax
The Chaoyun group can only reluctantly accept this result.
Although unsatisfactory
But at least one phased goal has been achieved
After the 2016 presidential election, the Democratic Progressive Party won the election and came to power
The driving force behind the DPP’s housing policy at that time
It’s Hua Jingqun from the Chao Yun Organization.
Hua Jingqun pointed out:
"Real estate is the locomotive of the economy" is a myth
Compared with the real estate market, the residential market actually contributes more to GDP.
The rental market should be improved
To help Taiwan's economic development
The DPP proposed three reforms after taking office
First, the Housing Act was amended.
Because the housing law passed in 2011 is full of problems
Leave all responsibility for building social housing to local governments
At that time, the Mayor of the Ministry of Interior Hua Jingqun cooperated with the private sector to amend the law.
It is expressly stipulated that the central government is responsible for the construction of social housing
stipulates that the proportion of economically disadvantaged residents must be 30%
Because social housing will not block builders’ financial opportunities
So even if the degree of revision exceeds 80%
Also successfully passed the third reading (December 2016)
But after the amendment
However, people are worried that social housing will turn into slums
Disturbing local public order
Causing local house prices to fall
<font color=#FBFF00FF>A piece of white cloth with big spray-painted words</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Protest to get out of the public house</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>The Beijing Municipal Fudu Development Bureau originally planned the evening of the 28th</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>A public housing briefing will be held at the road protection field base in Xinyi District</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>However, local residents strongly protested against the move of public housing</font>
The second reform of the DPP is to legislate the rental housing market
The Taiwan government has not paid attention to the rental market for a long time
leading to insufficient supply
Only accounts for 6-13% of the total housing stock
Other advanced countries have at least 25-40%
Because the cost of owning a house in Taiwan is extremely low
Landlords leave properties empty waiting for house prices to rise
It's better than renting it to others
The government does not legislate regulations
In fact, it is because the government has preset
People rent houses only for short periods of time
I will always enter the market to buy a house later.
So there is no need to legislate to protect the rights of tenants
This has resulted in 70% to 90% of rental properties being on the black market.
The government cannot control the quality of rental housing
Renting an apartment in Taipei is like visiting a haunted house at Disneyland
<font color=#FBFF00FF>The monthly rent for an apartment in Taipei’s Xinyi District is less than 9,000</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Netizens described the layout as like a prison cell</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>A private room also priced at NT$7,000 in Xinyi District</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>The space is only one square meter in size</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>There is also a toilet placed in an open space in the room</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>The cell that was jokingly called a big brother is really comfortable</font>
There are also many landlords who do not allow relocation of household registration
But rent assistance, child care, school districts, voting
They are all tied to household registration.
Tenants without household registration are deprived of various rights and interests
Second-class citizens
When the DPP originally wanted to legislate for the rental market, the draft included:
Reform the tax system to allow homeowners to rent out empty houses
Strengthen the industry and raise the level of the rental industry
There are also clearly defined rights and responsibilities for renting a house, such as deposit caps and penalties.
But during the period of revising the law, there was only one power-building industry left.
It became a leasing law
Because if the rights, responsibilities and obligations are regulated
Will inevitably affect the interests of landlords
As a result, the rights and interests of renters have been sacrificed
There is still no legal protection
Although this dissatisfied the housing groups
But at least Taiwan finally has a rental market law
It's still a step forward
The last reform during Tsai Ing-wen’s term is Real Price Login 2.0
In 2011, the Kuomintang government’s real-price registration
Only reveal segmentation and exclude registration of pre-sale houses
It was criticized upon its launch
Real Price Login 2.0 promises to make up for pre-sale house prices and reveal house numbers
Prevent real estate developers from relying on information gaps to drive up prices
But doing so will inevitably have an impact on the real estate class.
Therefore, after submitting it to the Executive Yuan for review in April 2018,
It has never been reviewed
They said they would wait until after the 9-in-1 election in 2018 to discuss it.
In 2019, Chao movement groups once again called on the Tsai Ing-wen government to stick to its original reform commitments
Promote real-price login 2.0
The government is deeply afraid of offending vested interests in real estate
As a result, Real Price Login 2.0 was shelved for two years.
The bill proposed by the Executive Yuan under the Democratic Progressive Party was blocked by the DPP legislators
Later, the Democratic Progressive Party legislators proposed a set of regulations on equalization of land rights.
As a solution that does not offend the builder
Until the end of the city lockdown due to the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020
House prices began to soar rapidly again
The DPP government only began to resume reforms under pressure
Submit Real Price Login 2.0 for review
Finally passed the third reading at the end of December 2020
Officially launched in 2021
After reading the last 30 years of residential justice reform
The author now wants to suggest
What’s Taiwan’s next step?
First we have to identify
Who are the biggest victims of residential justice today?
They are those young people who have no parents’ property to inherit.
They are not rich enough to afford a house
But not poor enough to apply for social housing
Become a sandwich class sandwiched in the middle
The authors suggest that we should move from social welfare to the concept of social investment
Current social benefits include rent subsidies, social housing
Neither is enough to solve the problem of young people being unable to afford housing.
we must realize
Helping young people solve housing problems is actually helping society
Because people who can’t afford a house
Often it’s because you weren’t born into a wealthy family
This will pass on negative effects to the next generation
create hereditary inequality
Young people can only rent a house
But the rental market is full of problems
You have to deal with the chore of finding an apartment every day
will affect work efficiency
It will also make young people less willing to have children.
Causing low birthrate problem and national security crisis
If the country can help young people avoid this housing pressure
Young people may be more willing to have children
Don't worry about your children not having a home
If the fertility rate increases
There are more children
Then the demand for manpower in the education industry will also increase.
in other words
If society is willing to invest in youth housing issues
will have positive benefits for future society
Therefore, the author proposes five major reform approaches
The first is shrinkage flow
Don’t let too much money flow into real estate
In August 2018, the Financial Supervisory Commission adjusted the provisions of the Banking Law (Article 72-2)
Said to encourage enterprises to expand production
Easing controls on capital flowing into the real estate market
This is considered a real estate loan clause
Causing the housing market to overheat
House price index rises rapidly
In addition, this year's new youth security policy
The housing market has gone too far

let's not forget
America’s Subprime Mortgage Crisis
It’s caused by banks issuing housing loans at will.
So the first thing that must be reformed is the banking law
To control the flow of funds into real estate
To curb the rising housing prices
The second step is to fight against house hoarding
Establish a hoarding tax
Let those who own multiple houses free up a large number of vacant houses
In order to encourage the release of rentals, a "rental exemption" clause can be used
If you are willing to rent out a house other than three bedrooms
can be exempted from housing tax
In order to avoid being heavily taxed
People who own multiple houses are more willing to rent out their houses.
Currently, only 5~7% of households in Taiwan have more than three rooms.
That is to say
The housing tax will not affect 90% of Taiwanese people
After the implementation of the hoarding tax, the cost of ownership increases
Homeowners will be more willing to rent out their homes
Solve the problem of insufficient supply in the rental market
This brings us to the third step of reform
Promote rental registration
Make the rental market transparent
Protect tenants’ rights
You can also specify the terms of whistleblowing
If the landlord hides the fact that he is renting the house
Tenants can report to tax authorities after renting out
Make it impossible for landlords to evade taxes
After the implementation of the house hoarding tax, tax revenue increased
The extra taxes can be used to reduce the burden on tenants
This is the fourth step of reform
Deduct taxes on rent expenses
The final step is that social housing should start from a lottery system
Change to international standard queuing system
In advanced Western countries, people queue up after drawing number plates.
This will put pressure on the government
Because the number plate was issued
It is tantamount to promising to build housing.
Instead of skipping the vote and promising to vote after being elected
Finally, we can also consider the third option that transcends markets and countries.
Cooperative Housing
A group of people who want to live in the same community
Raising funds to purchase land and build houses
No need for government or construction companies
People can organize themselves
Let residents discuss together what kind of public space they want to design
For example, in 1989
Academia Sinica employees once initiated the Scholars Villa Community
And 2017
New Taipei City launches Three Gorges and Peking University Qingyin co-living project
Select cohabitation partners with similar ideas
Create a community where young people and old people help each other
Let the elderly have a sense of community and not be lonely
To cope with Taiwan’s upcoming transition to an aging society
This type of cooperative housing
It has been implemented for many years in many European countries with an aging population.
can reopen our imagination of living
Find a way out beyond the market and the country
In this video, we introduce the evolution of Taiwan’s residential justice movement over the past 30 years.
Phase One, the Shellless Snail Movement in 1989
Build an image that transcends partisanship
Refuse to align with political forces
But also because he is not aligned with the party
As a result, it is unable to exert much influence on the government
After the second stage of the Asian financial crisis,
Non-governmental organizations actively establish cooperative relations with the government
The discussion has also shifted from the pursuit of ownership to the protection of residence rights
Forcing the government to change its attitude of laissez-faire market
Start establishing policy intervention market
Protect people’s right to live
to the third stage
Focus on policy initiatives
Develop critical and cooperative relationships with different political parties and government departments
Use pre-election political opportunities to create public opinion
Make candidates have to respond to the issue of high housing prices
The final success prompted the government to promote housing laws and real-price login 2.0
The problem of residential injustice is not just about housing
It will also affect Taiwan's economy, generational conflict, declining birth rate, and national security crisis.
to achieve residential justice
We must strengthen capital controls in the real estate market
Establish a housing tax to release a large number of empty houses for rent
Make the rental market transparent and protect the rights of tenants
Tax deduction for rent expenses to reduce tenants’ pressure
There are also social housing with a queue system.
Co-op housing
These are the directions that the next stage of reform can work towards.
to achieve residential justice
We cannot hope that the government will reform on its own
It is necessary to organize the power of the private sector to put pressure on the government
Let everyone’s right to live be protected
Let Taiwan no longer be an uninhabited island
