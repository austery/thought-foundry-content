>> Defence spending is a major
line item in the 2025 federal
budget.
Prime Minister Mark Carney has
pledged to hit a NATO target
of 2% of GDP this year
and 5% by 2035.
Does this sizeable investment
make sense?
What kind of difference will it
make for our armed forces?
I asked Richard Shimooka, senior
fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier
Institute and contributing
writer at The Hub, and
Stephanie Carvin, associate
professor at Carleton
University.
Richard, Stephanie, welcome to
the program.
Thank you so much for making
time.
Richard, I'm going to start
with you.
This marks 80 years since
the end of World War II.
Does warfare today look
anything like it looked to the
Canadian soldiers who fought
back then?
>> I mean, if you just think
about the parallel in our day
to day lives, right?
In some ways warfare just kind
of reflects how societies,
technologies and all that kind
of sort of improve over, over
generations.
And certainly our lives are
completely different today.
And and warfare is no different.
I think some of the major
developments in, let's
say, telecommunications, like
phones, right?
Like back then, the decision
making cycle, the decision
to make, we're going to bomb
something may take a week or so.
And much like if you had
decision a business would take,
you know, something like
to kind of bring together
information.
And then today it's done
within minutes or even seconds
to some degree of, you know,
the identification of a target,
all that at the same time,
some of the sort of core
strengths or ideas that you
think about, how you know what
Canadians are strong with,
which is ingenuity and sort of
how we operate on, on, on sort
of on our our daily lives is
still reflected in the military
so that, you know, it is it's a
challenge.
But we have a new
technological and societal kind
of backdrop, and that's how a
war is affected.
And so many of the core values,
the ideas that exist,
but the technology
environment, the military
is completely different.
>> Well, let's pick up on that.
Stephanie, what advancements or
technologies would you say have
changed the game the most?
>> Well, I think indisputably,
if we're talking since 1945,
it's nuclear weapons, right?
Nuclear weapons have really had
a huge impact on the way we
think about warfare, on the
strategy of warfare.
And to a certain extent,
you know, with the advent of
these nuclear weapons,
a lot of the aim now
is to deter force as opposed to
use force.
And, you know, the threat of
of violence is really
kind of latent in the sense
that, you know, you're
basically threatening massive
retaliation if you do something
that we don't like as opposed
to, you know, actually having
to go and use force and then
stop once you agree to our
terms.
So I think that's been a
large part of that.
But at the same time, we have
also seen, you know,
advancements in other
kinds.
It's not like there
hasn't been war since 1945.
There obviously has been.
And a lot of them have been
very different in the sense
that they are conflicts that
are between states and non-state
actors.
We had, of course, the wars
of decolonisation in the 1950s,
60s and 70s.
And, you know, in those cases,
you had, you know, armies that
had tremendous amounts of
lethality, like large numbers
of troops and struggled against
kind of ragtag groups of,
you know, well-organised,
well motivated, you know,
forces that were nevertheless
also supported by states
but were able to inflict
enough cost that these large
militaries were unable to to go
forward.
So it shows that, you know,
technology isn't always
the answer.
It's the way.
And I think this was,
you know, very much a part of
Richard's answer, your ability
to make those decisions quickly
to kind of integrate those
technologies into how you
think, but also your ability to
win hearts and minds,
which is a part of this
kind of information warfare,
which is also rapidly changing
the way, you know, states have
to think about armed conflict.
>> So with that, Richard, what
does a military need to do in
order to adapt and keep up with
the times when we talk about
technology, specifically.
>> The critical is flexibility.
I mean, you think about the
rapidity of how our technology
change is occurring right now,
right?
You think about think about
India in the space of
sort of bioethics or
biotechnology, right?
That's an area where you see
rapid development in sort of
new novel forms of pathogens
and areas.
And that's the military
has to keep it, keep focus on
this, because that's the
potential vector that one of
our adversaries may use.
You know, it's a niche area,
certainly, but it's just one of
many.
You think about AI right now,
just the difficulty that
governments are and our
societies are trying to deal
with this absolutely novel form
of technology that really
didn't exist in maybe a decade
and a half ago.
And the military is viewed as
basically being the new
commanding heights in the sense
that that if we are not on the
cutting edge of this, at least
to understand its effects and
its possibilities, then one of
our societies like China, which
is a huge investor in this
field, we may fall behind.
So certainly the ability to be
flexible, to have the sort of
reservoir of knowledge within
the department or the military
itself, to identify what are
the trends, what are the things
we need to watch, and what are
the things we need to avoid.
Those are the kind of critical
areas of flexibility that I
think you will see within the
department, within everywhere
else that are absolutely
required.
>> Stephanie, what kind of
capabilities do other
militaries have that the
Canadian Armed Forces don't?
>> It's a really interesting
question.
You know, and on some level,
it actually kind of gets
down to bullets, right?
Like we've heard stories that,
you know, Canadian armed forces
haven't been able to train with
bullets because there's an
ammunition shortage.
So that's kind of some of the
level that we're dealing with
right now.
And we can get back to that
maybe more in the budget part
of the conversation.
But I think to a large extent
that it's not you know, we have
really some really advanced
capabilities.
You know, we saw
the Canadian Armed Forces just
recently start up a cyber
command.
I think it's CAF Cybercom.
We have space based
abilities, although we're
looking to enhance them, and we
have really good capabilities
in the Arctic, in certain
capabilities up there that, you
know, even our NATO allies are,
are interested in and are
working with us on developing
further.
So, you know, so it's not to
say we don't have capabilities,
but one of the things that I
think that the Canadian
Armed Forces is looking at
right now is how warfare has
been changing, particularly
in the last, you know,
even just 3 to 4 years.
They're looking at the lessons
of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Right. And they're seeing how
quickly adaptation takes place.
You know, the challenges that
both sides are really having in
terms of manpower and how to
integrate force and technology
together in order to basically
survive in the case of Ukraine
or, you know, just simply some
of the brutality that still
continues to exist.
You know, if we think back to
the Syrian conflict in,
you know, the over the last
ten years, which is, you know,
thankfully largely resolved,
although there's still some
fighting in that region.
But, I mean, the Russian
armed forces were using
barrel bombs, which are just
simply, you know, metal
containers full of junk dropped
at large heights with dynamite
and cause huge, immeasurable
suffering.
So this isn't exactly
an advanced technology,
but it is a willingness to use
brutal, brutal force on
civilian populations.
That has definitely been
a character of the wars we've
been seeing in over the last
couple of years,
whether it's in Sudan, Ukraine,
Gaza, anywhere.
>> Richard, in August, the
Canadian army put out a policy
proposal about modernising the
force.
They said in that document,
the army we have is
not the army we need.
Can you describe the gaps that
exist between the army we have
and the army we need?
>> Well, it's manifold.
I mean, there's just there's so
I mean, to some degree, you have
to remember that most of our
allies had starting a major
modernisation cycle around 2014,
2015.
And that kind of aligns with
the Wales summit, the NATO
Wales summit, where that was
where the 2% guidelines were
first were first instituted.
And since then they have sort
of viewed what's gone in
Ukraine to such a great point
and also in other in other
conflicts to identify, well,
what are these major trends,
right.
And where can we go from here
to sort of deal with, to,
to address those, those issues?
So, for example, in the Army,
specifically air defence is
seen as absolutely vital
enabler.
We watched today what goes on
Ukraine with just the amount of
drones that they've really
taken up, a huge part of
sort of the Army's sort of
existing capabilities.
It's not a it's not a
replacement, but it's certainly
a supplement, let's say, for a
long range artillery, for the
ability to sort of identify
targets to reconnaissance is
probably the most important
development this area.
And so air defence systems
are absolutely vital to ensure
that, you know, armies can
remain protected, able to
to be mobile and sort of
undertake operations.
Canadian militaries
has, has identified
but a small number of systems,
but it's nowhere near
the sort of comprehensive
systems
that our allies have,
have, have brought in.
We don't have any real effective
long range artillery.
Our tanks are starting to get
old.
We don't have many because
we've actually donated a fair
few to Ukraine.
And I can get on and on
and on.
But the one part that I think
is really lacking that really
needs to be addressed
and accelerate progress.
So the networking component,
because just like in our
society today, as I mentioned
before, we think about phones
and, and sort of other
sort of social media
systems sort of bind us and
make us more effective in a lot
of our work.
The military has really been
slow to adopt this because
of those funding cutbacks,
and that's a real core area
that we need to address
and move forward.
>> All right. You talk funding.
Let's talk budget.
The Liberal government's
budget laid out more than
$80 billion over the next
five years to rearm and
reinvest in the military.
There is money set aside for
recruitment and retention, for
infrastructure and training and
for new equipment.
Stephanie, we know that we want
a line there for bullets, but
what else do you want to see
the money go to?
>> Well, one of the most
interesting things that is in
the budget is that of that 84
billion, 25% is earmarked just
simply for raises, right?
Just paying people to get to,
you know, who have joined the
armed forces, improving their
salary.
And hopefully that will help
improve recruitment and
retainment.
And I think that's a good
thing overall.
I mean, we want our soldiers to
be well paid because they are
in many ways making sacrifices
that many of us in the civilian
world aren't making on on a
regular basis.
So I think that's a very good
thing.
There's another, I think, $18
billion that's aimed at some of
the weapons that, you know,
Richard was just mentioning.
And, you know, if we look at
the, the the document that the
Army has been putting out,
they've identified a number of
those capabilities that they
need, just things to help them
just do better war fighting
generally. Right.
So things like better
precision becoming harder
to detect, deny. I think,
you know, that's part of the
lessons of Ukraine for sure.
You know, being able to target
better, target faster.
I think that's a large part
of it.
They've also identified the
need to engage in long range
capabilities.
So a lot of that kind of
long range precision is
a part of that $18 billion.
And and then finally kind of
long term, I don't think this
is in the $84 billion, but it is
in the budget generally is the
ability to, you know, help
develop the Arctic. Right?
You know, if you want to
be up there, you need strong,
safe, healthy communities
in the Arctic.
And so having things like roads
that exist year round
is going to be very
important, particularly if
you're going to emphasise the
Army and military's ability to
have persistence in the north.
So just simply building up
those capabilities so we can
put numbers of people up there
in the Arctic in this, this
document, you know, all the
recent documents, whether
defence policy update or the
inflection point. 2025 Army
document, really are
emphasising the Arctic as a
central area of importance in
the future.
>> Richard, I want to get your
take on that as well.
But overall, what do you make
of the budget's plans for
defence spending?
>> I think it's maybe the first
initial blueprint to use some
of their language, but I think
it still requires a lot more
detail to actually get a full
appreciation of what it may
entail.
And I also, as a general view,
because we've been so delayed
on the actual modernisation
vis-a-vis our allies,
we probably need more
investment or significantly
more investment.
The problem is, is there's
just not enough capacity
within the department to
actually execute on, on, on
some of these ambitions.
So it has definitely has a
great rundown of those aspects.
The only one area that probably
add might be is that there is
$6.6 billion for the defence
industrial base of Canada, an
area that in order to sort of,
let's say, get the munitions,
get the ships and whatnot that
are required to sort of execute
on on the broad policy,
ambition is really required.
And even there, I would argue
that there's just there's just
not enough amount.
The other one aspect that I
think is, is important to view
is that a lot of this was put
into a five year time frame,
and we don't know about exactly
the details and also the
sequencing.
Is it going to be backloaded
like a lot of other previous
policy documents or budgets,
or is it frontloaded or evenly
distributed?
Those are big questions.
So we need to see a bit more,
as would be my thought.
And we probably need to spend
more as well.
>> Yeah. And if I could just
compliment that point I would
just say that, you know, the
word submarine doesn't really
appear in the budget. Right.
And so we know that's something
that's coming.
That's a decision down the road.
But yeah I mean I wouldn't
exactly call it's a blueprint.
But like the faintest, faintest
of blue, there's a lot more
detail that's going to have to
come out in the next couple
of years.
But I think that clearly the
military is seeing this as a
generational opportunity.
And hopefully we will see that
plan come to to fruition.
A friend of mine put it
recently, it's like they it's as
if the government has invited
the military to go to the
buffet, but not given them any
dietary restrictions.
And so we're going to have to
wait to see how that works out.
>> All right. Richard, the some
have said that the budget
strategy seems to have two
purposes rearming the Canadian
military and at the same time,
economically developing the
Canadian defence industry.
On paper, some people might
look at that and be like, hey,
that's really good.
Two for one right there.
Does that is that
the right strategy?
>> I think it carries a fair
bit of risk.
And I'd say the Ministry of
Finance's comments just after
the budget, where he says it
has to support Canadian economy,
I think is is kind of reflects
the potential risks of it.
Frankly, if you look at
defence industries in most
other countries, it's
subservient to defence policy.
It is it is a direct line
towards it.
And one of the ironies that
Canada actually exports about
as much as it produces for its
own domestic utility, right,
in the defence industry.
So we actually have a highly
globalised industry.
But the reality is that the
Canadian Forces have basically
been starved for 20, if not 30
years of some pretty critical
investments.
And if you start sort of
diverting to look towards, oh,
what can we get the most for
the domestic benefit of Canada
without actually addressing
those?
Arguably the most fundamental
concern that government has in
terms of its foreign policy or
its its sovereignty, you are
not going to get the bang for
your buck.
You may actually get less
capability at much higher costs.
Right? And and just not even
you wouldn't get the great
economic output because it's
not really hinged on what the
forces needs. Right.
And and what what are you what
would be sustainable in long
term because you're just kind of
making economic bets rather
than actually sustained bets on,
you know, what what is required
for those for the national
sovereignty of the country.
>> Stephanie,
you got the last word on this
30s.
Is this the right strategy?
>> It's hard to say
because just simply
we don't have enough detail.
Yeah, right.
And, you know, we've spent a lot
of time
talking about defense.
We're also waiting on
national security strategy,
which will be coming out
hopefully sometime this year
or early next year.
We've been waiting for one now
for four years.
So what the vision of defense
is going to be for
this country is going to be
really,
really important.
And, you know,
Richard talked
about all these important
aspects of,
the defense industiral base
But we also are now faced with
the
decision of, well, how close
we want to be
with the United States,
you know, interoperability.
We're going to be part
of this golden dome,
which is not an actual dome.
Of course, it's
going to be several military
systems
that about missile defense.
but, you know,
these are some
really important decisions.
And Canadians have some very
strong
feelings about,
you know, who our allies are
right now.
And so how the government
navigates this on
top of all the procurements
that we're going to be
making, is going to be
something I will be paying
very close attention to,
over the next couple of months.
>> We are going to leave it
there.
Stephanie, Richard, it looks
like we're going to have
this conversation in a few
months' time.
So looking forward to it.
And thank you for your insights.
>> Thank you.
