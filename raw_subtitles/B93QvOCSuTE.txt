Before you have a million dollars, don't even think about passive income. You have no asset to actually earn passive income off of. Your time is much better spent learning how do you get your first million dollars than it is through passive income and thinking how you're going to earn a percentage on the principal that you've invested. If you make $60,000 a year, 8% on that isn't gonna get you to financial freedom. Don't figure out how to crack 8% to maybe I'm gonna get 15% returns because the principle is still so small. The 60,000 is so small. Actually learn how do I make my income 160,000. But what's wild once people learn how to do this, as soon as you get there, you're like, "Oh my gosh, if that's all it took." for these people that I used to think were special to earn an additional 100,000. And now all I have to do is do that same process again to go from where I'm at to be able to earn 1.6 million, do a 10X, sign me up. And so passive income is great at a certain stage of life, but 99% of your time should be focused on how do I make the first plan go fricking right and do everything I can today to control plan A.
