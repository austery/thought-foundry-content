Welcome
 everyone
 to
 the
 OnPaly
 podcast.


I'm
 Steve
 Pagan
 and
 I'm
 John
 Michael


McGrath.


>> Today
 on
 the
 pod,
 it
 looks
 like
 Premier


Doug
 Ford
 won't
 have
 to
 pour
 any
 more


Crown
 Royal
 down
 the
 drain.
 He's
 made


peace
 with
 that
 brand's
 manufacturer.


After
 critics
 complained
 about
 more
 than


7
 years
 of
 starving
 the
 postsecondary


system,
 the
 province
 is
 giving
 colleges


and
 universities
 a
 lifeline
 but
 making


significant
 changes
 to
 OSAP.


>> Not
 the
 case
 for
 school
 boards,
 however.


Rumors
 persist
 that
 the
 education


minister
 is
 going
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 them.


And
 none
 of
 his
 recent
 actions
 is


disabusing
 anyone
 of
 that
 notion.


>> And
 in
 your
 column,
 my
 column,
 I
 will


make
 the
 case
 for
 reprohibiting
 uh


online
 gambling.


>> Rep-prohibiting.
 Okay,
 that's
 a
 neat


word.
 And
 I'm
 focusing
 on
 something
 I


still
 think
 is
 important
 and
 not
 some


old-fashioned
 notion,
 and
 that
 is


civility
 in
 public
 life.


>> It's
 Friday,
 February
 20th,
 2026.
 So,


let's
 get
 to
 it.


JMM,
 good
 to
 see
 you,
 pal.
 Little
 sugar


to
 start
 things
 off
 as
 always.


>> Good
 to
 see
 you.


>> Now,
 I
 see
 that
 you're
 in
 morning
 and


you
 know
 it's
 a
 for
 those
 who
 are


listening
 on
 podcast
 and
 can't
 see
 this.


>> You
 are
 wearing
 a
 shirt.


>> Yes.


>> Which
 says
 Pluto,


>> never
 forget
 1930,
 which
 I
 presume
 was


the
 year
 the
 planet
 was
 discovered.


>> Yes.


>> To
 2006,
 which
 I
 presume
 is
 the
 year


that
 it
 was
 determined
 it
 is
 no
 longer
 a


planet.


>> Yes.
 the
 the
 year
 that
 astronomers


sinned
 against
 us
 all
 and
 demoted
 uh


Pluto
 from
 the
 the
 ranks
 of
 the
 the
 the


nine
 planets.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 I
 I I


periodically
 in
 this
 podcast
 uh
 take
 a


little
 bit
 of
 fun.
 I
 hope
 I'm
 never


cruel
 or
 unkind
 about
 it
 by
 uh


emphasizing
 the
 age
 difference
 between


uh
 you
 and
 I,
 but
 things
 are
 starting
 to


crop
 up
 that
 increasingly
 make
 me
 feel


old.
 And
 I
 was
 uh
 walking
 through
 a
 mall


and
 I
 saw
 this
 t-shirt
 and
 had
 that
 sort


of
 realization
 that
 this
 year,
 this


August,
 will
 be
 20
 years
 since
 uh
 the


the
 Astronomical
 Association
 uh
 stripped


Pluto
 of
 its
 uh
 rightful
 god-given


title.
 And
 uh
 and
 that
 made
 me
 feel


really
 old.


>> And
 uh
 so
 uh
 in
 a
 bit
 of
 solidarity,
 I


thought
 I
 would
 wear
 this
 t-shirt.
 And


also
 just
 because
 it's
 a
 nerdy
 thing
 and


uh
 we
 we
 wear
 nerdy
 t-shirts
 here.


>> We
 do.
 Well,
 okay.
 Time
 for
 time
 for
 me


to
 plead
 guilty
 to
 that.


>> Yes.


>> Here
 we
 go.
 I
 am
 wearing
 David
 Peterson


today.
 And
 let
 me
 just
 stand
 up
 and
 uh


you
 can
 take
 a
 look.
 That
 is
 actually


his
 portrait
 at
 Queens
 Park.
 That
 is


what's
 on
 the
 front
 of
 my
 t-shirt
 today.


And
 why
 am
 I
 wearing
 a
 a
 t-shirt
 with


Ontario's
 20th
 premier
 on
 it?
 Well,
 I'm


going
 to
 tell
 you
 because
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 talk
 these
 days
 about
 the
 Ontario


Liberals
 who
 are
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 yet


another
 leadership
 convention.
 And
 I


will
 tell
 you
 that
 44
 years
 ago


tomorrow,
 February
 21st,
 1982,
 David


Peterson
 won
 the
 Ontario
 Liberal


Leadership.
 There
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 discussion


this
 time
 round
 as
 well
 about
 how
 old


you
 have
 to
 be
 to
 run
 for
 the
 leadership


because
 there
 are
 some
 people
 in
 their


30s
 who
 are
 running
 for
 it.
 And
 I'm


hearing
 I'm
 hearing
 a
 lot
 of
 discussion


from
 older
 Liberals
 who
 are
 saying,


"Yeah,
 well,
 you
 know,
 sure,
 the
 the


30somes
 can
 take
 a
 run
 at
 it,
 but
 nobody


takes
 them
 seriously."
 David
 Peterson


won
 the
 leadership
 of
 the
 Ontario


Liberals
 when
 he
 was
 38,


>> right?


>> And
 it
 wasn't
 his
 first
 goround.
 He'd


actually
 run
 the
 first
 time,
 the


previous
 leadership
 convention,
 and
 he


was
 32
 the
 first
 time.
 So
 take
 that.
 It


was
 a
 delegated
 convention.
 I
 want
 to


remind
 everybody
 of
 that,
 which
 are
 the


best
 kind,
 of
 course.
 He
 was
 the
 clear


favorite.


>> The
 only
 kind
 you
 will
 ever
 acknowledge.


>> I
 agree.
 I
 agree.
 He
 got
 46%
 on
 the


first
 ballot.
 So
 it
 was
 pretty
 much
 a


foregone
 conclusion
 that
 he
 was
 going
 to


win
 this
 thing.
 He
 came
 in
 very
 strong.


Do
 you
 remember
 who
 he
 beat?


>> I
 don't
 off
 hand.


>> He
 defeated
 Sheila
 Cops.


>> Oh,


>> who
 was
 an
 MPPP
 from
 Hamilton
 at
 the


time
 and
 who
 would
 eventually
 abandon


Peterson,
 go
 run
 federally
 and


eventually
 became
 the
 deputy
 prime


minister
 for
 Jean
 Cretchamp.
 But
 she


came
 second
 in
 that
 convention.
 And
 just


to
 show
 you
 how
 strange
 politics
 can
 be,


when
 they
 did
 some
 polling
 in
 January
 of


1985
 and
 they
 asked
 Ontarians,
 can
 you


identify
 the
 leader
 of
 then
 her


majesty's
 loyal
 opposition,
 which
 was


him?


>> Yes.


>> 10%
 of
 the
 people
 could
 identify
 him.
 10


meant
 90%
 of
 the
 people
 had
 no
 clue
 who


David
 Peterson
 was.


>> And
 of
 the
 10%
 who
 could
 could
 identify


him,
 90%
 of
 those
 worked
 in
 Queens
 Park


in
 some
 capacity


>> or
 were
 related
 to
 him.
 Six
 months
 after


that
 poll
 was
 taken,
 he
 was
 the
 20th


premier
 of
 Ontario.
 It
 just
 shows
 you


how
 quickly
 things
 can
 turn
 around.
 He's


the
 guy
 who
 ended
 the
 42-year
 long
 PC


dynasty,
 which
 ended
 in
 1985.


Incidentally,
 I
 can
 scarcely
 believe
 it


as
 I
 say
 this,
 he
 is
 now
 82
 years
 old.


He
 is
 the
 chair
 of
 the
 board
 of
 Torstar,


which
 of
 course
 publishes
 the
 Toronto


Star,
 and
 he
 is
 still
 a
 very
 influential


force
 in
 politics
 and
 in
 the
 country.


So,
 there
 we
 go.
 David
 Peterson,
 and


that's
 his
 portrait
 at
 Queens
 Park.
 Uh


if
 I'm
 I
 don't know
 if
 I'm
 allowed
 to


plug
 another
 podcast
 here,
 but
 uh
 why


not?
 There's
 a
 a
 um
 uh
 podcast
 from
 I


would
 say
 the
 the
 center
 left
 or
 or


progressive
 uh
 view
 of
 think
 progress


Canada.
 They
 did
 a
 a
 lengthy
 interview


with
 David
 Peterson
 specifically
 on
 the


topic
 of
 uh
 rebuilding
 a
 party
 in
 the


wilds
 uh
 if
 I
 could
 put
 it
 that
 way
 and


and
 obviously
 relevant
 to
 the
 current


predicament
 the
 Ontario
 Liberal
 Party


finds
 itself
 in.


>> No
 question.
 And
 I
 remember
 the
 like
 one


of
 the
 funniest
 things
 about
 this
 was
 he


was
 born
 in
 1943,
 which
 is
 the
 year
 the


Tory
 dynasty
 started.
 Meaning
 until
 he


became
 the
 Liberal
 premier
 of
 Ontario,


there
 were
 exactly
 zero
 Liberal
 premers


of
 Ontario
 in
 his
 lifetime.


>> Yeah.


>> Just
 goes
 to
 show
 you
 things
 can
 change.


They
 can.
 And
 with
 that,
 let's
 get
 off


to
 issue
 one.


It
 was
 one
 of
 the
 most
 iconic
 images
 of


Doug
 Ford's
 current
 third
 term
 as


premier
 excoriating
 the
 British
 liquor


manufacturer
 Diagio
 in
 front
 of
 all
 the


cameras.
 Ford
 emptied
 a
 bottle
 of
 Crown


Royal
 all
 over
 the
 pavement
 to
 indicate


his
 opposition
 to
 Diagio's
 closing
 one


of
 its
 plants
 in
 Ammerisburg,
 which
 is


near
 Windsor.
 But
 it
 seems
 the
 premier


and
 the
 manufacturer
 have
 found
 a
 $23


million
 peace
 offering.
 JMM,
 what's
 up?


>> Peace
 in
 our
 time,
 right?
 Uh
 the


government
 says
 that
 Dagio
 has
 agreed
 to


make
 $23
 million
 in
 investments
 in


Ontario
 to
 offset
 the
 jobs
 lost
 from
 the


closure
 at
 the
 Amhersburg
 plant.
 Now
 to


be
 clear,
 that
 closure
 is
 still
 going


ahead.
 Uh
 those
 union
 jobs
 are
 for
 now


still
 being
 lost.
 Uh
 the
 plant
 may


reopen
 under
 new
 ownership,
 but
 that
 is


still
 up
 in
 the
 air.
 The
 government
 is


touting
 this
 as
 a
 win,
 saying
 that
 these


uh
 investments
 wouldn't
 have
 happened


without
 the
 pressure
 campaign
 that
 the


premier
 put
 on
 Diagio
 and
 for
 its
 part


uh
 Ontario
 says
 that
 because
 of
 this


settlement,
 DIO
 brands
 will
 stay
 on
 the


shelves
 at
 the
 LCBO.
 That
 of
 course
 was


the
 threat
 that
 the
 premier
 had
 made


that
 he
 would
 pull
 all
 of
 their
 liquor


from
 LCBO
 shelves.


>> So
 23
 million
 bucks.
 Where
 are
 they


spending
 it
 on
 on
 what?


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 scandalize
 you,
 Steve,


but
 sometimes
 uh
 governments
 say
 things


that
 are
 not
 strictly
 accurate.


>> Wait
 a
 minute.
 Say
 that
 again.


>> So,
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 through
 this
 in
 a


bit
 of
 detail,
 but
 I
 I
 just
 want
 to
 sort


of
 say
 that
 the
 headline
 here,
 at least


to
 me,
 is
 that
 a
 very
 large
 fraction
 of


what
 is
 being
 touted
 here,
 is
 not
 really


an
 investment
 by
 DIO.
 But
 let's
 give
 the


government
 it's
 due
 first.
 There's
 $1


million
 in
 this
 package
 that
 is
 being


spent
 on
 uh
 economic
 development
 and


other
 community
 projects
 in
 Amherstburg


itself.
 Uh
 by
 the
 usual
 standards
 of


government
 spend,
 I
 think
 we
 can
 fairly


call
 that
 at least
 an
 investment.


>> $1
 million.


>> 1
 million
 of
 the
 23
 million.
 uh
 I
 would


say
 is
 unc
 un
 controversially
 an


investment.
 Then
 there's
 $3
 million
 in
 a


new
 readyto
 drink
 alcoholic
 beverage
 uh


package
 that
 will
 be
 supplied
 via
 uh
 a


Toronto
 partner
 company
 and
 another2


million
 for
 a
 packaging
 partner
 in
 Scar


Bro.


>> So
 what
 what
 are
 we
 up
 to?
 We're
 we're


five
 bucks
 right
 now
 being
 invested


outside
 of
 southwestern
 Ontario
 for


every
 $1
 invested
 in
 southwestern


Ontario.


>> Yes.
 So
 5
 to1
 so
 far
 the
 benefits
 are


going
 to
 Toronto
 as
 opposed
 to


Amherstburg


>> which
 will
 make
 them
 thrilled
 no
 doubt.


>> Uh
 indeed
 right
 Toronto
 real
 uh
 uh


tumble
 weeds
 strewn
 city
 that
 needs
 all


the
 help
 it
 can
 get.
 Uh
 and
 things
 get


squishier
 still.
 Uh
 there
 is
 a
 promised


uh
 $1
 million
 for
 organizations
 that


support
 the
 growth
 and
 sustainability
 of


Ontario's
 agricultural
 sector
 and
 a


commitment
 to
 spend
 $5
 million
 on


marketing
 and
 promotion
 here
 in
 Ontario.


>> Okay,
 that
 gets
 us
 about
 halfway
 there.


Where's
 the
 rest
 of
 mine?


>> So,
 this
 is
 the
 thing.
 Uh
 fully
 $11


million
 of
 these
 so-called
 investments


in
 Ontario.
 $11
 million
 is
 a
 single


large
 purchase
 by
 Dagio
 of
 alcohol
 uh


for
 blending
 in
 their
 products.
 Right.


This
 is
 uh
 what
 I
 imagine
 is
 a
 pretty


substantial
 purchase,
 but
 it's
 a
 a
 a


volume
 uh
 purchase
 from
 Greenfield


Global
 uh
 which
 is
 a
 a
 distillery
 in


Eastern
 Ontario.
 And
 I
 say
 distillery,


but
 this
 is
 like
 a
 what
 I
 think
 most


people
 would
 see
 as
 a
 an
 industrial


ethanol
 plant.
 This
 is
 not
 a
 mom
 and
 pop


batch
 distillery.
 This
 is
 a
 a
 large


industrial
 plant.
 Um
 now,
 you
 know,
 this


is
 a
 big
 purchase.
 I'm
 sure
 that


Greenfield
 Global
 is
 is
 happy
 to
 take


Dashio's
 money,
 but
 it
 is
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day
 just
 the
 bulk
 purchase
 of
 a


commodity.
 This
 is
 not
 what
 you
 or
 I


would
 normally
 describe
 as
 an


investment.
 Uh
 even
 by
 the
 standards
 of


government
 spin.
 And
 to
 go
 back
 to
 uh


you
 know
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about


earlier
 for
 those
 keeping
 track
 at
 home


the
 overwhelming
 beneficiaries
 of
 this


entire
 package
 again
 these
 are
 all
 the


numbers
 that
 that
 the
 government
 laid


out
 in
 its
 own
 press
 release.
 Uh
 the


overwhelming
 beneficiaries
 of
 uh
 of
 this


package
 are
 Toronto
 and
 uh
 this
 Eastern


Ontario
 uh
 distillery.
 About
 4%
 of
 the


money
 uh
 is
 going
 to
 Amherstburg
 and


jobs
 and
 community
 projects
 around
 the


plant
 where
 these
 jobs
 are
 being
 lost.
 I


suspect
 I
 don't
 even
 need
 to
 ask
 this


question,
 but
 I
 will
 anyway.
 How's
 that


going
 over
 in
 Ammerisburg?


>> Uh,
 yeah,
 funny
 you
 should
 ask.
 Uh,


Amherstburg
 Mayor
 Michael
 Pru
 panned
 the


deal,
 telling
 the
 CBC
 that
 none
 of
 this


is
 going
 to
 help
 a
 single
 soul
 in


Ammerstburg.
 Uh,
 a
 note
 for
 our


audience,
 uh,
 you
 may
 not
 recognize
 the


name
 Michael
 Pru,
 but
 he
 was
 a
 New


Democrat
 MPP
 uh,
 at
 the
 legislature.
 He


previously
 represented
 Beaches
 East


York.
 He
 was
 actually
 my
 MPP
 when
 I


became
 a
 Queens
 Park
 reporter.


>> He
 was
 the
 last
 mayor
 of
 East
 York,
 too,


I
 think.
 I


>> I
 believe
 that's
 correct.
 Yes.
 um
 before


the
 mega
 city
 came
 along.


>> He
 he
 has
 had
 this
 uh
 I
 don't
 know
 what


you
 would
 even
 call
 it,
 a
 third
 or


fourth
 act
 in
 politics.
 He
 is
 now
 the


the
 mayor
 of
 Amhersburg.
 Also
 the
 uh


local
 representative
 for
 Unifor
 for
 the


these
 workers
 who
 were
 at
 the
 uh
 Dagio


plant
 uh
 was
 also
 disappointed
 telling


the
 CBC
 it's
 a
 pretty
 weak
 deal
 uh
 when


DIO
 makes
 so
 much
 money
 in
 the
 province


every
 year.


>> I
 I'm
 trying
 to
 remember
 now.
 I
 remember


there
 were
 other
 premers
 in
 Canada
 who


were
 saying
 to
 Doug
 Ford,
 "This
 is


really
 not
 fair
 that
 you
 were
 doing


this,
 making
 a
 big
 display
 of
 pouring


the
 booze
 out
 all
 over
 the,
 you
 know,


and
 throwing
 it
 out
 because
 as
 if
 that


were
 a
 metaphor
 for
 what
 this
 company
 is


doing
 to
 the
 province
 of
 Ontario
 because


we're
 supposed
 to
 be
 now
 in
 a
 new
 era
 in


Canada
 where
 we're
 supposed
 to
 be
 less


concerned
 about
 which
 province
 in


particular
 has
 the
 manufacturing


capability.
 The
 bigger
 deal
 is


provincial
 boundaries
 down.
 Keep
 the


manufacturing
 somewhere
 in
 Canada.
 And


Dio
 does
 have
 a
 plant
 in
 Manitoba
 and
 it


does
 have
 a
 plant
 where
 else?


Newfoundland,
 I
 think.
 Newfoundland
 and


Labrador
 somewhere
 down
 in
 Atlantic


Canada.
 Anyway,


>> um
 and
 yet
 Doug
 Ford
 was
 making
 a
 big


display
 of
 this
 and
 he
 was
 saying,
 "Oh,


no,
 no,
 no.
 Doug,
 don't
 don't don't
 get


suckered
 into
 believing
 that
 this
 is


going
 to
 stay
 in
 Canada.
 Before
 you
 know


it,
 they're
 going to
 move
 everything
 to


Alabama."
 Now
 I
 like
 to
 kind
 of
 test
 the


veracity
 of
 politician
 statements
 when


they
 make
 them.
 Do
 we
 have
 any
 idea


whether
 that
 is
 potentially
 true?


>> You
 know
 we
 we
 have
 no
 evidence
 yet.
 Uh


let
 me
 put
 it
 that
 way.
 Um
 one
 thing
 we


are
 seeing
 uh
 an
 increasing
 trend
 uh
 and


I
 I
 I
 you
 know
 who
 knows
 how
 long
 it


will
 uh
 last
 given
 how
 intertwined
 it
 is


with
 American
 politics
 right
 now.
 But
 a


lot
 of
 manufacturers
 are
 um
 going
 along


two
 tracks
 if
 I
 can
 put
 it
 that
 way.


Right.
 They
 they
 are
 of
 course
 uh


locating
 production
 in
 the
 United
 States


to
 uh
 uh
 maintain
 access
 to
 that
 market


with
 a
 uh
 US
 administration
 that
 is
 very


fond
 of
 tariffs.
 Uh
 but
 uh
 they
 are
 also


uh
 rationalizing
 their
 production
 and


that's
 what
 DIO
 says
 it's
 doing
 in
 this


case.
 Uh
 they
 are
 also
 uh
 consolidating


their
 production,
 rationalizing
 it


outside
 of
 the
 US
 market
 as
 well.
 Uh
 so


they're
 they're
 they're
 sort
 of


islanding
 their
 their
 uh
 plants
 uh
 in


the
 US
 u
 while
 also
 maintaining


production
 outside
 the
 US
 in
 the
 uh
 the


rest
 of
 the
 free
 world
 if
 I
 can
 put
 it


that
 way.


>> They
 got
 plants
 all
 over
 the
 world.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 and
 and
 you
 know
 who
 who
 knows


how
 far
 this
 will
 go.
 There's
 been
 some


interesting
 reporting
 just
 in
 the
 last


week
 about
 Mark
 Carney
 trying
 to
 build
 a


sort
 of
 a
 bridge
 between
 the
 European


Union
 and
 some
 of
 the
 market
 economies


of
 uh
 uh
 the
 uh
 the
 what
 we
 used
 to
 call


the
 Trans-Pacific
 Partnership
 but
 uh
 a


lot
 of
 Asian
 countries
 and
 you
 know
 in


theory
 you
 could
 see
 a
 trading
 block
 of


something
 like
 one
 and a
 half
 two


billion
 people.
 Um,
 and
 whether
 that


materializes
 is
 obviously
 a
 very
 open


question,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 you're
 seeing
 a


lot
 of
 companies
 sort
 of
 hedge
 their


bets
 and
 and
 put
 production
 both
 in
 the


US
 and
 also
 outside
 of
 the
 US.
 So,
 I
 I


to
 get
 back
 to
 your
 question,
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 obvious
 that
 the
 Canadian


plants
 that
 Dio
 says
 it's
 maintaining,


uh,
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 there
 is
 a
 a
 a


ticking
 time
 bomb
 awaiting
 them.
 I
 I


think
 a
 company
 like
 DA
 would
 see
 those


as
 as
 assets
 uh
 to
 uh
 to
 to
 use
 outside


of
 the
 US
 to
 serve
 markets
 outside
 of


the
 US.


>> We're
 not
 hedging
 here
 either.
 We're


right
 off
 to
 issue
 two.


When
 the
 progressive
 conservatives
 took


power
 nearly
 eight
 years
 ago,
 one
 of
 the


first
 things
 they
 did
 was
 freeze
 college


and
 university
 tuition
 rates,
 thereby


starving
 the
 post-secary
 system
 of
 the


money
 it
 needed
 to
 keep
 the
 lights
 on.


The
 result,
 courses
 were
 cancelled,


staff
 laid
 off,
 and
 students


disappointed.
 Yes,
 their
 tuition
 was
 not


going
 up,
 but
 their
 courses
 and
 the


course
 choices
 that
 they
 had
 available


were
 significantly
 reduced.
 Nearly
 eight


years
 later,
 the
 government
 seems
 to
 be


changing
 course.
 What
 are
 they
 doing,


JMM?


>> So,
 the
 government
 is
 uh
 allowing


tuitions
 to
 uh
 increase
 again.
 They
 are


ending
 the
 freeze,
 and
 we'll
 get
 to
 that


in
 a
 moment.
 Uh
 but
 they
 are
 also
 making


uh
 more
 provincial
 money
 available
 to


universities.
 they
 are
 increasing
 the


funding
 for
 universities
 and
 colleges


from
 $5.4
 billion
 to
 $7
 billion


annually.
 So
 uh
 over
 the
 course
 of
 four


years
 that
 will
 amount
 to
 uh
 $6.4


billion
 in
 new
 money.
 Uh
 so
 the
 the
 more


controversial
 side
 of
 this
 of
 course
 is


that
 they
 are
 in
 fact
 ending
 the
 tuition


freeze.
 uh
 they
 are
 going
 to
 allow


universities
 to
 increase
 uh
 tuition
 by


2%
 over
 the
 next
 3
 years
 and
 then
 after


that
 it
 will
 be
 uh
 either
 uh
 2%
 uh
 or
 uh


the
 rate
 of
 inflation
 whatever
 is
 lower.


>> That's
 not
 the
 most
 controversial
 part.


Well,
 indeed,
 uh,
 the
 the
 most


controversial,
 uh,
 change
 is,
 I
 think


almost
 certainly
 their
 changes
 to
 OSAP,


the
 the
 student
 uh,
 uh,
 loan
 and
 grant


assistance
 that,
 uh,
 I
 I
 actually
 don't


even
 know,
 but
 I
 assume
 the
 vast


majority
 of
 Ontario
 students
 access
 it


in
 one
 form
 or
 another.
 Currently,
 the


students
 uh,
 who
 access
 OSAP
 are
 able
 to


receive
 up
 to
 85%
 of
 their
 assistance
 in


uh,
 the
 form
 of
 grants,
 right,
 that
 do


not
 need
 to
 be
 repaid.
 uh
 the
 that


amount
 that
 threshold
 is
 being
 lowered


to
 25%.
 The
 maximum
 you
 will
 be
 able
 to


get
 uh
 from
 OSAP
 as
 a
 grant
 will
 be
 25%.


The
 remainder
 would
 be
 made
 as
 a
 loan


that
 would
 have
 to
 be
 uh
 repaid.
 So


obviously
 the
 financial
 assistance
 they


receive
 will
 be
 more
 difficult
 for
 them


to
 repay
 uh
 than
 it
 previously
 had
 been.


Obviously
 they
 see
 that
 as
 kind
 of
 a
 raw


deal.


>> A
 little
 historical
 perspective
 here.
 50


years
 ago,
 Ontario
 was
 funding
 per
 pupil


in
 the
 post-secondary
 system
 10th
 out
 of


all
 10
 provinces.
 50
 years
 later,
 would


you
 care
 to
 guess
 how
 well
 Ontario
 is


funding
 on
 a
 per
 capita
 basis
 the


post-secary
 students
 of
 this
 province?


>> Are
 we
 still
 10th
 out
 of
 10?


>> We
 are
 still
 10th
 and
 I
 think
 maybe
 we


jumped
 up
 to
 ninth
 for
 a
 what
 do
 they


call
 for
 a
 New
 York
 minute,
 but
 that
 was


about
 it.
 We've
 basically
 been
 10th
 out


of
 10
 for
 for
 the
 last
 50
 years.


>> Students
 naturally
 have
 been
 very
 upset


about
 that.
 Here
 is
 some
 new
 money
 going


into
 the
 system,
 which
 I
 suspect


everybody
 will
 appreciate.


>> The
 premier
 had
 some
 things
 to
 say
 to


students
 who
 are
 very
 unhappy
 with
 the


changes
 to
 OSAP
 that
 are
 coming
 down.


So,
 let's
 see
 what
 he
 had
 to
 say.
 Doug


Ford,


>> you're
 picking
 basket
 weaving
 courses


and
 there's
 not
 too
 many
 baskets
 being


sold
 out
 there.
 Go
 into
 healthc
 care.
 Go


into
 uh
 trades.
 Go
 into
 uh
 jobs
 of
 the


of
 the
 future.


>> Did
 you
 take
 basket
 weaving
 in
 postsec?


I
 didn't
 take
 that.
 Basket
 weaving
 was


not
 available
 to
 me
 in
 either
 my


bachelors
 or
 master.
 Anyway,
 what's
 you


know
 sometimes
 the
 premier
 can't
 help


himself.
 What's
 the
 reaction
 been
 this


time?


>> You
 know,
 I
 have
 to
 say
 there
 is
 a


technocratic
 argument
 that
 the
 the


government
 is
 is
 making
 uh
 smart
 moves


here
 and
 a
 quote
 like
 the
 one
 offered
 by


the
 premier
 does
 not
 help
 sell
 it,
 if
 I


could
 put
 it
 that
 way.
 um
 you
 know


ending
 the
 tuition
 freeze
 I
 think
 most


observers
 said
 like
 it
 it
 had
 to
 come
 to


an
 end
 one
 way
 or
 the
 other
 and
 it


probably
 would
 have
 been
 better
 if
 the


government
 had
 ended
 it
 earlier
 in
 fact


um
 the
 changes
 to
 OSAP
 are
 are
 more


arguable
 they
 will
 probably
 uh


disproportionately
 make
 it
 harder
 for
 uh


lowincome
 students
 to
 access
 post-secary


education
 that's
 a
 genuine
 problem
 and


and
 you
 know
 hopefully
 the
 government


can
 make
 policy
 to
 lessen
 that
 burden


obviously
 students
 students
 are
 not


going to
 be
 uh
 happy
 about
 this.
 But


educating
 students
 is
 only
 one
 part
 of


what
 the
 university
 and
 college
 system


does,
 right?
 We
 also
 uh
 hope
 to
 fund
 you


know
 world-class
 research
 institutes
 and


uh
 you
 know
 it's
 a
 a


a
 much
 more
 important
 pillar
 of
 the


economy
 in
 that
 sense
 than
 simply
 uh


educating
 students
 as
 much
 as
 it's
 also


kind
 of
 like
 educating
 students
 is
 what


keeps
 the
 lights
 on
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these


places.
 Uh
 so
 you
 know
 as
 I
 say
 uh
 there


are
 arguable
 benefits
 to
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


these
 changes
 but
 that
 line
 from
 the


premier
 about
 basket
 weaving
 maybe
 not


helpful.


We
 have
 talked
 on
 this
 show
 um
 I
 think


on
 more
 than
 a
 few
 occasions
 about
 a


blue
 ribbon
 panel
 so-called
 that
 the


premier's
 own
 government
 struck.
 It's


got
 to
 be
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago
 already


that
 that
 happened.
 And
 this
 was
 again


the
 premier's
 own
 appointees
 to
 its
 own


blue
 ribbon
 panel.
 They
 came
 back
 with
 a


recommendation
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 ago


saying
 you
 got
 to
 up
 the
 amount
 of
 money


going
 into
 the
 post-secondary
 system


because
 we're
 on
 the
 verge
 of
 having
 you


know
 a
 a
 significantly
 deteriorated


system
 and
 okay
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 it
 here.


Bill
 Davis
 used
 to
 say
 get
 education


right
 and
 everything
 else
 falls
 into


place.
 A
 better
 educated
 population


means
 a
 healthier
 population,
 better


jobs,
 more
 income.
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 all


of
 the
 things
 we
 want,
 we
 get
 when


people
 are
 better
 educated.
 The
 things


we
 don't
 want,
 we
 don't,


>> you
 know,
 if
 people
 get
 less
 education,


that's
 what
 you
 get.
 So,
 let's
 go
 back


to
 that
 blue
 ribbon
 panel.
 How
 does
 does


this
 get
 closer
 to
 what
 that
 panel


ultimately
 recommended?


>> You
 know,
 as
 I
 mentioned,
 the
 the
 end
 of


the
 tuition
 freeze
 is
 uh
 something
 that


the
 panel
 recommended
 and
 that


universities
 and
 colleges
 desperately


wanted
 to
 see.
 Um
 but
 the
 the
 increase


in
 funding
 available
 uh
 from
 uh
 that


tuition
 increase
 uh
 on
 a
 per
 student


level
 it's
 it's
 I
 mean
 you
 know
 for
 some


people
 of
 course
 every
 marginal
 dollar


is
 uh
 a
 burden
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 to


minimize
 that
 but
 the
 the
 relative


change
 certainly
 in
 the
 first
 few
 years


is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 huge
 but
 uh
 you


know
 as
 we
 say
 Ontario
 is
 is
 still
 even


with
 these
 uh
 changes
 on
 Ontario
 is


still
 on
 track
 to
 be
 10th
 out
 of
 10th


uh
 10th
 out
 of
 10
 rather
 um
 in
 terms
 of


provincial
 per
 capita
 spending
 uh
 QP
 the


uh
 union
 that
 represents
 uh
 most
 workers


in
 uh
 universities
 and
 colleges
 uh
 noted


of
 course
 that
 Ontario's
 funding
 is


still
 uh
 well
 short
 uh
 adjusted
 for
 uh


they
 once
 you
 adjust
 for
 inflation
 and


the
 change
 in
 student
 population
 they


estimate
 that
 uh
 the
 system
 will
 still


be
 about
 $1.5
 billion
 short
 of
 where
 it


was
 in
 2018.
 That's
 just
 the
 cumulative


effect
 of
 uh
 tuition
 and
 other
 funding


not
 keeping
 up
 with
 uh
 uh
 demand.
 Uh


they
 are
 saying
 that
 even
 with
 this
 new


money,
 there
 will
 still
 be
 cuts
 to
 uh


jobs
 and
 of
 course
 we've
 seen
 both
 uh


layoffs
 and
 the
 uh
 both
 a
 threat
 of
 and


in
 fact
 the
 start
 of
 uh
 some
 strikes


through
 the
 system.
 QP
 says
 we
 can


expect
 uh
 more
 of
 that
 unless
 more
 money


is
 made
 available.
 Not
 quite
 a
 peace


settlement
 here
 yet.


>> Not
 quite.
 No.
 And
 we
 should
 not
 forget


the
 other
 piece
 of
 this
 which
 is
 the


federal
 government
 had
 a
 role
 in
 a
 lot


of
 the
 starvation
 if
 you
 want
 to
 use


that
 word
 of
 the
 post-secary
 system


because
 when
 they
 cut
 back
 on
 the
 number


of
 student
 visas
 from
 foreign
 students


that
 was
 money
 and
 remember
 these


foreign
 students
 were
 paying
 three
 four


five
 times
 the
 tuition
 rates
 that
 made


in
 Ontario
 kids
 were
 paying
 and
 um
 as
 a


result
 the
 loss
 of
 that
 money
 really


hurt
 as
 well.
 It
 was a
 perfect
 storm.


dynamic
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 like
 the


province
 froze
 tuitions.
 So,


universities
 and
 colleges
 uh
 sorry,


because
 of
 course
 they
 froze
 domestic


tuitions.
 Universities
 and
 colleges
 went


and
 recruited
 foreign
 students
 to
 make


up
 that
 gap.
 Uh
 the
 federal
 government


uh
 threw
 the
 doors
 open
 uh
 and
 and
 said,


"Hey,
 great.
 You
 know,
 we
 want
 more


people.
 We
 want
 more
 students
 coming
 to


Canada
 and
 studying
 here."
 uh
 that


created
 this
 huge
 surge,
 but
 then


provinces
 didn't
 for
 example
 address


like
 housing
 issues.
 Uh
 the
 the


immigration
 wave
 became
 incredibly


unpopular.
 The
 federal
 government
 then


pulled
 back
 on
 student
 visas.
 The
 and


then
 then
 the
 universities
 and
 colleges


who
 let's
 you
 know
 go
 back
 to
 the


beginning
 were
 trying
 to
 fill
 the
 hole


created
 in
 part
 by
 the
 tuition
 freeze


suddenly
 found
 themselves
 looking
 at


bare
 shelves,
 you
 know,
 empty
 wallets
 if


I
 could
 put
 it
 that
 way.
 Um,
 so
 yeah,


more
 than
 enough
 blame
 to
 go
 around
 for


everybody.


>> What
 was
 Newton's
 third
 law?
 Every


action
 has
 an
 equal
 and
 opposite


reaction.


>> Yes,
 true
 in
 politics.


>> True
 in
 politics
 as
 well.


>> Let's
 move
 on
 to
 issue
 three.


>> Well,
 we've
 got
 some
 more
 evidence
 this


week
 that
 school
 boards
 are
 deeply


concerned
 that
 they're
 about
 to
 be


legislated
 out
 of
 existence
 by
 this


provincial
 government.
 Mith
 Radlin
 is


the
 chair
 of
 the
 Waterlue
 Region


District
 School
 Board
 and
 she
 has


written
 the
 education
 minister
 formally


requesting
 his
 ministry
 undertake
 a


comprehensive
 provincewide
 consultation


or
 even
 a
 referendum
 before
 making
 any


irreversible
 decision
 about
 the
 future


of
 school
 boards.
 Radland
 has
 also


written
 the
 Ontario
 ombbudsman
 asking


him
 to
 intervene
 and
 review
 what's
 going


on.
 This
 is,
 I
 suspect,
 the
 clearest


case
 yet
 that
 school
 boards
 think
 their


ultimate
 demise
 is
 coming.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 this
 is
 builds
 on
 a
 number
 of


signs
 we've
 seen
 from
 the
 government.


Uh,
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 most
 obvious
 being


that
 I
 believe
 now
 seven
 school
 boards


are
 under
 provincial
 supervision
 with
 a


a
 director
 appointed
 by
 the
 Minister
 of


Education
 functionally
 taking
 over
 the


roles
 of
 the
 school
 board
 trustees.
 um


many
 rumors
 that
 the
 province
 will


simply
 as
 you
 say
 legislate
 the
 school


boards
 out
 of
 existence
 and
 the
 the


minister
 when
 he's
 been
 uh
 when
 he's


spoken
 about
 this
 publicly
 has
 always


caveed
 it
 by
 saying
 that
 he
 is
 going
 to


leave
 the
 Catholic
 boards
 alone
 and


leave
 the
 French
 language
 uh
 school


boards
 alone
 because
 they
 have
 uh


constitutional
 protections
 the
 uh
 the


Catholic
 board
 since
 Canada's
 inception


in
 1867
 the
 French
 language
 boards
 have


protections
 under
 the
 chart
 charter
 from


1981.
 So
 now
 we
 have
 this
 letter
 from


Radlin
 specifically
 asking
 the


government
 to
 preserve
 English
 language


public
 boards
 and
 asking
 for
 public


consultation
 and
 uh
 asking
 for
 the


ombbudsman
 to
 investigate.


>> Well,
 the
 ombbudsman
 has
 influence
 but
 I


don't
 know
 if
 the
 ombbudsman
 has
 power.


Can
 the
 ombbudsman
 demand
 anything
 here?


>> No.
 No.
 Uh
 even
 the
 the
 ombsman
 could


write
 an
 extremely
 critical
 report
 about


this
 but
 uh
 the
 the
 ombsman
 does
 not


have
 any
 uh
 direct
 power
 to
 alter
 the


course
 of
 uh
 government
 policy.
 That
 is


not
 the
 role
 that
 we
 generally
 give


officers
 of
 the
 legislature.
 In
 so
 far


as
 there
 is
 a
 role
 for
 the
 ombbudsman


here,
 I
 think
 it
 would
 be
 uh
 looking
 at


whether
 students
 and
 parents
 in
 the


education
 system
 are
 being
 treated


fairly
 by
 administrators.
 And
 you
 know,


we've
 already
 heard
 from
 some
 advocates


that
 there's
 a
 real
 concern
 they
 have


that
 if
 they
 no
 longer
 have
 elected


trustees
 on
 their
 side
 that
 they
 could


get
 into
 disputes
 with
 school


administration
 about
 let's
 say
 for


example
 matters
 of
 you
 know
 um
 student


discipline
 or
 whether
 uh
 students
 have


proper
 access
 to
 extended
 services
 that


they
 might
 need.
 uh
 without
 an
 elected


trustee
 on
 their
 side,
 they're
 worried


about
 just
 getting
 uh
 swallowed
 up
 in


the
 the
 bureaucracy
 of
 the
 education


system.
 And
 that's
 exactly
 the
 kind
 of


issue
 that
 an
 ombudsman
 would
 be
 uh
 well


suited
 to
 address
 and
 and
 perhaps
 write


a
 report
 about.
 But
 no,
 they
 can't
 stop


legislation.


>> Well,
 I
 know
 when
 we
 have
 municipal


elections
 that
 the
 number
 of
 people
 who


vote
 for
 trustees
 is
 kind
 of


embarrassingly
 low.


Having
 said
 that,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 problem


either
 with
 your
 school
 or
 with
 the


system
 or
 with
 a,
 you
 know,
 a
 director


of
 education
 or
 whatever,
 I
 mean,
 at
 the


moment,
 the
 person
 you
 call
 is
 your


trustee.
 And
 your
 trustee
 is
 supposed
 to


be
 your
 advocate
 to
 try
 to
 make
 things


make
 sense
 in
 the
 public
 education


system
 right
 now.
 If
 they
 get
 rid
 of


trustees,
 I
 mean,
 who
 do
 you
 call
 if
 not


Ghostbusters?
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 and
 that
 that
 is
 one


potential
 political
 problem
 for
 the


government,
 right?
 If
 if
 you
 legislate


away
 school
 board
 trustees,
 then
 the


minister
 of
 education
 becomes
 the
 person


who
 you
 call,
 right?
 Um
 like
 this
 all


becomes
 the
 government's
 fault
 and
 the


government's
 problem,
 right?
 Um
 you


know,


>> you
 break
 it,
 you
 own
 it.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Like
 at
 the
 moment,
 I


don't
 think
 many
 people
 are
 like
 calling


up
 Paul
 Kandra
 and
 screaming
 at
 him


because
 the
 school
 bus
 didn't
 pick
 up


their
 kid.


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 you
 can't
 get
 to


him.
 I
 mean,
 number
 one,
 but
 number
 two,


yeah,
 you're
 right.
 They
 don't
 call
 the


Minister
 of
 Education.
 they
 call
 their


trustee.


>> Yeah,
 we
 can
 make
 the
 argument
 that
 it


would
 be,
 I
 think,
 wise
 for
 the


government
 to
 uh
 engage
 in
 broad


consultation
 if
 they're
 going
 to
 make
 a


very
 uh
 big
 change
 like
 this,
 but
 there


is
 also
 a
 time
 limit
 here
 in
 that
 we
 are


holding
 a
 municipal
 and
 schoolboard


trustee
 election
 in
 October.
 So,
 I
 I


frankly
 don't
 expect
 them
 to
 um
 consult


very
 uh
 lengthy.


>> You
 don't
 see
 provincewide
 public


hearings
 in
 the
 near
 future?


>> Uh
 no,
 no.
 Um
 and
 you
 know,
 it's
 it's


not
 a
 requirement,
 right?
 um
 just
 as
 a


like
 a
 if
 I
 could
 put
 it
 as
 a
 procedural


or
 a
 constitutional
 you
 know
 matter


right
 this
 is
 squarely
 in
 provincial


jurisdiction
 the
 legislature
 can
 make


law
 regarding
 uh
 matters
 of
 provincial


jurisdiction
 so
 long
 as
 the
 bill
 is


properly
 introduced
 and
 gets
 three


readings
 and
 three
 votes
 at
 the


legislature
 and
 is
 signed
 by
 the
 left


tenant
 governor
 that
 is
 a
 good
 bill
 that


is
 a
 good
 law
 and
 courts
 have
 tended
 to


uh
 defer
 to
 it
 now
 I
 say
 that
 but
 the


Canadian
 Civil
 Liberties
 Association
 did


speak
 at
 Queens
 Park
 this
 week
 and
 one


of
 the
 things
 that
 they
 mentioned
 is


that
 of
 the
 school
 boards
 that
 have
 been


placed
 under
 supervision
 by
 the
 province


at
 the
 moment.
 Uh
 many
 of
 them
 are
 uh


the
 most
 uh
 diverse
 school
 boards
 in


Ontario
 and
 they
 serve
 uh
 some
 of
 the


highest
 populations
 of
 low-income
 people


in
 Ontario.
 And
 so


I
 I
 I
 definitely
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 out


on
 a
 limb
 here,
 but


one
 of
 the
 only
 potential
 avenues
 I


could
 see
 for
 successfully
 challenging


this
 in
 court
 would
 be
 to
 argue
 that
 uh


dissolving
 the
 English
 language
 school


boards
 but
 not
 uh
 Catholic
 or
 French


language
 school
 boards
 uh
 is
 a
 form
 of


unequal
 treatment
 of
 certain
 uh


demographics
 in
 Ontario
 uh
 that
 is
 not


permissible
 under
 the
 charter.


>> Is
 this
 an
 argument?
 It's
 an
 argument.


Um
 I
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 uh
 how
 the
 the
 the


courts
 would
 handle
 that
 uh
 argument,


but
 uh
 you
 know
 it
 is
 something
 that
 I


would
 u
 flag
 for
 our
 audience
 is


something
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 because
 I
 do


suspect
 that
 uh
 if
 the
 government
 brings


forward
 legislation
 uh
 it
 will
 in
 fact


get
 challenged
 because
 I
 mean
 almost


every
 major
 policy
 this
 government


presents
 does
 get
 fought
 in
 court.


>> And
 I
 think
 we
 should
 be
 clear
 here
 you


and
 I
 are
 not
 taking
 a
 position
 on


whether
 they
 should
 or
 should
 not


abolish
 school
 board
 trustees.
 I
 think


what
 we
 are
 saying
 is
 the
 position
 of


school
 board
 trustee
 is
 the
 oldest


elected
 position
 in
 Canadian
 history.


They
 predate
 Confederation
 and
 if
 you're


going
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 something
 that
 has


existed
 for
 literally
 more
 than
 158


years,


>> uh
 you
 better
 have
 thought
 it
 through.


So
 that's
 I
 think
 that's
 all
 we're


saying.


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 know
 uh
 you
 used
 the
 uh


the
 words
 irreversible
 changes
 in
 the


setup
 to
 this
 and
 and
 it's
 funny
 because


other
 provinces
 have
 abolished
 school


boards
 only
 for
 an
 election
 to
 ensue
 a


different
 government
 to
 be
 brought
 into


power
 and
 then
 have
 school
 boards


reestablished
 in
 some
 cases.
 So
 you
 know


>> that's
 rare.
 Usually
 usually
 when
 the


toothpaste
 out
 of
 the
 tube
 it
 stays
 out.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 would
 not
 expect


necessarily
 like
 a
 a
 future
 government


if
 we
 get
 down
 this
 road
 where
 this


government
 abolishes
 school
 boards.
 I


don't
 necessarily
 expect
 a
 future


government
 to
 restore
 them,
 but
 all
 I


would
 say
 is
 it's
 rare
 to
 find
 a
 truly


irreversible
 change,
 right?
 A
 a
 a


government
 that
 was
 motivated
 could
 in


fact
 bring
 school
 boards
 back
 if
 they


wanted
 to.


>> That's
 true.
 Although
 I
 noticed
 the
 mega


city
 still
 exists.
 I
 noticed
 that
 closed


hospitals
 from
 30
 years
 ago
 did
 not


reopen.


>> I
 noticed
 that
 welfare
 rates
 that
 were


cut
 30
 years
 ago
 have
 not
 been


reestablished.
 I've
 noticed
 that
 anyway.


I
 won't
 go
 on.
 Well,
 and
 and
 we'll
 get


to
 the
 next
 segment.
 I
 won't
 belabor


this,
 but
 you
 know,
 the
 if
 the
 next


government
 does
 not
 restore
 school


boards,
 that
 will
 also
 tell
 us
 something


about
 uh
 how
 uh
 valuable
 and
 useful
 uh


any
 government
 sees
 them
 as
 uh
 in
 the


administration
 of
 education.


>> And
 with
 that,
 let's
 get
 off
 to
 your


column,
 my
 column.


Time
 now
 for
 our
 regular
 feature,
 your


column,
 my
 column,
 in
 which
 JMM
 and
 I


have
 a
 little
 chat
 about
 the
 columns


that
 we
 wrote
 for
 the
 TVO
 website
 over


the
 past
 week.
 We
 love
 it
 when
 you
 hear


about
 the
 columns
 here
 and
 then
 you
 go


online
 to
 tvO.org
 and
 you
 click
 on
 our


pictures
 and
 you
 find
 the
 columns
 and


you
 read
 them
 and
 say,
 "Oh,
 I
 feel
 so


much
 better
 informed
 about
 all
 of
 these


issues
 now.
 So,
 what
 are
 you
 going
 to


better
 inform
 us
 about
 right
 now?"
 Uh


well,
 I
 got
 on
 my
 soap
 box
 a
 little
 bit


this
 week
 where
 uh
 you
 wrote
 something


uh
 a
 week
 or
 two
 ago
 about
 uh
 a
 a
 group


of
 people
 who
 are
 trying
 to
 uh
 ban
 the


uh
 advertisements
 for
 sports
 gambling
 in


during
 sports
 broadcasts.
 And
 um
 I


not
 only
 do
 I
 support
 that,
 I
 I
 honestly


uh
 think
 we
 need
 to
 go
 even
 further.
 Uh


so
 like
 just
 to
 set
 the
 table
 here,
 I


mean
 not
 only
 do
 we
 have
 plenty
 of


evidence
 that
 the
 explosion
 in
 online


sports
 gambling
 is
 corrosive
 to
 sports,


uh
 we
 know
 that
 it
 is
 uh


disproportionately
 creating
 financial


harms
 for
 people
 with
 lower
 incomes.
 Um


it
 is
 particularly
 uh
 uh
 harming
 uh


young
 men
 on
 low
 incomes
 and
 uh
 there's


just
 almost
 nothing
 to
 recommend
 it
 as
 a


policy
 decision
 at
 this
 point.
 uh
 we
 are


not
 even
 frankly
 uh
 making
 a
 ton
 of


money
 uh
 at
 least
 on
 the
 public
 side
 of


things
 uh
 from
 having
 uh
 legalized
 and


and and
 regulated
 uh
 sports
 gambling.
 Uh


the
 the
 most
 recent
 figure
 from
 the


province
 of
 Ontario
 is
 that
 uh
 for
 the


current
 fiscal
 year
 we
 are
 expected
 to


make
 something
 like
 uh
 sorry
 the


province
 is
 expected
 to
 collect


something
 like
 250
 million
 230
 million
 I


forget
 exactly
 um
 which
 is
 objectively
 a


large
 sum
 but
 it's
 also
 about
 what


Ontario
 spends
 before
 noon
 on
 any
 given


day
 right
 it's
 it's
 just
 not
 that
 much


money
 in
 the
 the
 scale
 of
 the
 provincial


budget
 and
 so
 with
 all
 of
 the
 evidences


of
 the
 harms
 that
 uh
 online
 gambling


grid
 and
 frankly
 uh
 the
 the
 spread
 of


what
 I
 would
 call
 sort
 of
 gambling


adjacent
 like
 things
 and
 I'm
 talking


here
 about
 things
 like
 prediction


markets
 uh
 where
 we
 have
 seen
 uh
 I
 mean


probably
 like
 the
 one
 that
 sticks
 in
 my


brain
 as
 like
 maybe
 one
 of
 the
 most


alarming
 cases
 was
 um
 uh
 think
 tanks


that
 have
 been
 uh
 maintaining
 maps
 of


the
 warfront
 in
 Ukraine.
 uh
 there
 there


was
 an
 allegation
 that
 some
 of
 the
 the


uh
 information
 being
 provided
 and
 like


this
 is
 an
 incredibly
 useful
 public


resource
 and
 there
 was
 an
 allegation


that
 some
 of
 that
 that
 information
 was


changed
 in
 order
 to
 capitalize
 on
 online


betting
 in
 these
 prediction
 markets.
 I


mean,
 stuff
 like
 that
 is
 just
 scheaving


me
 right
 out.


>> And
 so,
 obviously,
 some
 of
 this
 stuff
 is


just
 not
 within
 can
 Canadian


jurisdiction
 and
 it's
 not
 something
 that


we
 can
 uh
 uh
 change.
 But
 in
 so
 far
 as


there
 is
 stuff
 within
 Canadian
 and


Ontario
 uh
 jurisdiction
 that
 we
 can
 uh


regulate,
 I
 really
 have
 come
 come
 down


pretty
 uh
 securely
 on
 on
 the
 side
 of
 not


only
 do
 we
 need
 to
 uh
 prohibit


advertising
 of
 online
 gambling.
 I
 really


think
 we
 need
 to
 consider
 the
 last


decade
 something
 of
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 mistake


and
 we
 were
 never
 really
 meant
 to
 have


casinos
 in
 our
 pockets
 and
 that
 is
 what


we
 have
 now.
 We
 have,
 you
 know,
 uh
 uh


>> they're
 on
 our
 phones


>> through
 online
 gambling.
 we
 we
 have
 slot


machines
 in
 our
 pockets
 and
 I
 don't


believe
 that
 is
 uh
 healthy
 for
 uh


individuals
 and
 I
 don't
 believe
 it
 is


healthy
 for
 us
 as
 a
 public
 and
 you
 know


people
 say
 oh
 well
 you
 know
 if
 you
 try


to
 prohibit
 it
 people
 will
 just
 go
 back


to
 using
 you
 know
 off
 uh
 offshore


websites
 and
 stuff
 and
 I
 just
 don't


think
 that's
 true
 right
 like
 the
 the


actual
 history
 when
 it
 was
 more


difficult
 to
 gamble
 online
 fewer
 people


gambled
 online
 uh
 the
 the
 whole


explosion
 of
 access
 has
 uh
 has
 become
 a


problem
 precisely
 because
 it
 is
 so
 easy.


And
 if
 we
 make
 it
 more
 difficult
 for


people
 to
 gamble
 online,
 I
 I
 really
 do


think
 we
 will
 just
 see
 fewer
 people


gambling
 online
 and
 that
 that
 will
 be


better
 for
 uh
 as
 I
 say,
 better
 for


individuals
 and
 better
 for
 the
 public.


>> Fascinating.
 Good.


>> How
 about
 you?


>> Well,
 a
 little
 background
 before
 we


start
 here.
 For
 50
 years,
 there
 was
 a


former
 Ontario
 cabinet
 minister
 named


Darcy
 McHugh.
 He
 was
 the
 treasurer
 back


in
 the
 Bill
 Davis
 days.
 He
 used
 to
 host


a
 lunch
 in
 downtown
 Toronto
 in
 honor
 of


the
 first
 premier
 he
 ever
 served,
 which


was
 Mr.
 Davis's
 predecessor,
 John


Roberts.
 Mr.
 Roberts
 was
 the
 premier


from
 1961
 to
 71.
 You
 all,
 of
 course,


know
 about
 the
 big
 library
 at
 the


University
 of
 Toronto
 that's
 named
 after


John
 Roberts.
 It
 was
 a
 very
 particular


kind
 of
 lunch.
 It
 was
 men
 only.
 It
 was


pretty
 much
 Tory
 men
 only.
 It
 was
 lots


of
 pipe
 and
 cigar
 smoking,
 right?
 and
 a


lot
 of
 booze,
 but
 also
 a
 lot
 of
 good


stories.
 And
 I
 know
 about
 this
 because
 I


used
 to
 get
 invited
 to
 go
 to
 this
 lunch


because
 I
 wrote
 a
 book
 about
 Mr.


Roberts,
 but
 I
 don't know
 15
 20
 years


ago.
 So,
 I
 attended
 and
 even
 though
 I


was
 probably
 15,
 20
 years
 younger
 than


everybody
 else.
 I
 I
 kind
 of
 like
 the


stories
 and
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 um
 you
 know


there
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 history
 that
 I


learned
 u
 listening
 to
 all
 these
 stories


and
 so
 on.
 Darcy
 McHugh
 died
 in
 2023,


and
 I
 thought,
 I
 wonder
 if
 we
 can


somehow
 keep
 this
 lunch
 going,
 albeit


with
 some
 changes
 to
 modernize
 it.
 So,
 I


I
 spoke
 to
 both
 of
 Darcy
 McHugh's
 sons,


Stuart
 and
 Jamie,
 and
 I
 said,
 "Would
 you


mind
 if
 I
 try
 to
 keep
 this
 going?"
 And


they
 said,
 "No
 problem
 at
 all."
 And
 I


said, "Great.
 I
 want
 to
 honor
 your


father
 as
 well."
 Well,
 so
 we're
 going
 to


call
 it
 now
 the
 Roberts
 McHugh
 lunch
 and


it's
 going to
 be
 an
 annual
 thing
 and


it's
 going
 to
 be
 obviously
 men
 and
 women


and
 it's
 going to
 be
 all
 parties


represented
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 okay
 a


little
 booze
 but
 uh
 no
 smoking
 and
 sorry


Darcy
 but
 that's
 just
 that's
 what
 we
 got


to
 do
 now.
 We
 had
 our
 third
 annual


Roberts
 McHugh
 lunch
 last
 week.
 Greg


Lyall
 from
 the
 Innovative
 Research


Group,
 one
 of
 the
 country's
 better


pollsters,
 came
 and
 he
 shared
 some
 fresh


data
 with
 us
 on
 whether
 the
 public
 cares


about
 something
 that
 you
 and
 I
 care
 a


lot
 about
 and
 talk
 about
 from
 time
 to


time
 here,
 namely
 civility
 in
 politics.


And
 do
 we
 care
 about
 it,
 particularly
 in


this
 age
 of
 political
 toxicity?
 And
 I
 am


delighted
 to
 report
 that
 apparently
 yes,


we
 do
 across
 all
 party
 stripes
 and


supporters
 in
 all
 age
 demographics.
 Now,


read
 the
 column
 if
 you
 want
 more


specifics.
 There's
 all
 sorts
 of
 charts


in
 there
 that'll
 tell
 you,
 you
 know,


break
 it
 all
 down
 for
 you.
 But
 a
 as
 an


example
 of
 something
 we
 just
 saw,
 the


picture
 in
 British
 Columbia
 of
 the
 prime


minister
 of
 Canada
 and
 the
 leader
 of
 the


opposition
 who
 are
 after
 each
 other


hammer
 and
 tongue
 almost
 every
 day,


standing
 there
 at
 this
 vigil
 after
 the


mass
 murder
 in
 British
 Columbia,
 holding


hands,


united
 in
 their
 grief,


trying
 to
 project
 an
 image
 of
 unity
 for


the
 country.


That
 means
 a
 lot
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 people


>> and
 the
 polling
 proves
 that.
 So
 go
 to


the
 website,
 check
 a
 look
 uh
 at
 at
 this


column.
 We
 need
 civility
 in
 politics.
 We


need,
 of
 course,
 a
 clash
 of
 partisan


ideas
 as
 well.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 we
 don't,


but
 less
 toxicity,
 more
 civility
 would


be
 a
 good
 thing.
 I'll
 share,
 if
 I
 may,


one
 more
 story
 about
 this
 Roarts
 McHugh


lunch,
 and
 that
 is
 uh
 you're
 a
 Star
 Trek


Next
 Generation
 fan.


>> I
 am
 indeed.


>> Okay.
 We
 happen
 to
 be
 meeting
 on
 the


actual
 date
 of
 the
 55th
 anniversary
 of


the
 leadership
 convention
 in
 1971
 at


Maple
 Leaf
 Gardens
 that
 picked
 Bill


Davis
 as
 the
 leader
 of
 the
 Ontario
 PC


party
 on
 the
 fourth
 ballot
 at
 2
 in
 the


morning
 by
 44
 votes
 in
 a
 good


old-fashioned
 delegated
 convention.
 Sean


Roberts
 was
 the
 premier
 at
 the
 time.
 Mr.


Davis
 was
 elected
 to
 replace
 him
 and
 he


won
 that
 convention
 on
 the
 strength
 of


Darcy
 McHugh
 dropping
 off
 the


penultimate
 ballot
 and
 getting
 some
 of


his
 delegates
 to
 support
 Mr.
 Davis.
 He


was
 the
 kingmaker.
 Sheldon,
 can
 I
 have


this
 picture
 up
 here,
 please?
 Because


here
 we
 have
 a
 picture
 of
 Neil
 Davis,


the
 son
 of
 Bill
 Davis
 in
 the
 middle,


Stuart
 Mchugh,
 the
 son
 of
 Darcy
 McHugh


on
 the
 left,
 and
 Richard
 Robarts,
 who
 is


a
 cousin
 of
 John
 Roartz's
 on
 the
 right.


55
 years
 to
 the
 day
 that
 the
 older


generation
 made
 history
 at
 Maple
 Leaf


Gardens,
 the
 younger
 generation,
 the


next
 generation
 met
 at
 this
 Roberts


McHugh
 lunch.
 And
 interestingly
 enough,


these
 three
 had
 never
 met
 before.


>> Oh,
 wonderful.


>> So,
 this
 was
 kind
 of
 Yeah,
 I
 thought
 so,


too.
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 kind
 of
 a
 lovely,


wonderful
 moment.
 So,
 there
 we
 go.
 This


is
 the
 kind
 of
 political
 nerdery
 you
 two


can
 experience
 if
 you
 come
 to
 the
 lunch


next
 year,
 and
 I
 hope
 you
 will.


>> All
 right,
 with
 that,
 let's
 go
 to
 the


mailbag.


>> You
 got
 it.
 If
 you've
 got
 a
 burning


question
 or
 insightful
 comment,
 please


send
 it
 along
 to
 us
 at
 onp


politics@tvo.org.


What
 do
 we
 got
 up
 this
 week?


>> This
 is
 an
 email
 from
 listener
 Kathleen


from
 Whitby
 who
 writes,
 "I'm
 looking
 at


a
 full
 page
 ad
 for
 Intersect
 2026.
 This


is
 a
 conference
 put
 on
 by
 the
 Glob
 and


Mail.
 Doug
 Ford
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 speaker


at
 this
 future-based
 dialogue
 and


tickets
 are
 $1,000.
 Is
 this
 ethical?


He's
 speaking
 about
 key
 issues
 impacting


Ontario
 and
 our
 nation.
 It
 seems
 like


he's
 already
 getting
 paid
 to
 do
 that.


I'm
 just
 curious
 about
 the
 ethics
 of


this
 and
 if
 other
 premieres
 have
 done


similar
 things.
 It
 seems
 like
 something


you
 should
 do
 after
 you're
 done
 being


the
 premier.
 I
 love
 your
 podcast.
 Thank


you
 for
 doing
 it
 and
 I
 will
 be


listening.
 Thanks,
 Kathleen.
 Uh
 for


those
 who
 don't
 know,
 as
 I
 mentioned


earlier,
 Intersect
 is
 hosted
 by
 the


Globe
 and
 Mail
 newspaper.
 Doug
 Ford
 is


both
 uh
 speaking
 there
 and
 being


interviewed
 by
 our
 uh
 Queens
 Park


colleague
 Laura
 Stone.


>> And
 I'm
 willing
 to
 bet
 that
 of
 the


thousands
 that
 people
 have
 to
 pay
 to
 go


to
 this,
 none
 of
 that's
 going
 to
 end
 up


in
 Doug
 Ford's
 pocket.
 So,
 I
 did
 reach


out
 to
 the
 premier's
 office
 to
 confirm


uh
 the
 premier
 is
 not
 accepting
 any
 kind


of
 speaking
 fee.
 They
 also
 emphasized
 he


has
 never
 accepted
 any
 kind
 of
 speaking


fee
 for
 these
 kinds
 of
 public


engagements.
 But
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 some


remedial
 civics,
 uh
 let's
 say
 that


wasn't
 true
 and
 that
 Premier
 Ford


accepted
 a
 speaking
 fee
 for
 this


engagement,
 uh
 this
 falls
 under
 the


Members
 Integrity
 Act.
 And
 generally


speaking,
 MPPPS
 are
 forbidden
 from


accepting
 gifts
 or
 fees
 that
 are


connected
 either
 directly
 or
 indirectly


with
 their
 duties
 as
 NPPs.
 The
 principle


being
 as
 Kathleen
 says,
 you
 get
 paid
 to


be
 an
 MPP
 uh
 and
 you
 should
 not
 be


taking
 money
 from
 outside
 of
 that
 uh
 to


do
 your
 job.
 Now,
 there
 are
 exceptions


to
 the
 rule.
 First,
 if
 it's
 incidental


or
 a
 customary
 gift
 that
 is
 normally


connected
 to
 what
 the
 act
 calls
 social


obligations
 accompanying
 the
 office.
 So,


if
 the
 premier
 goes
 to
 a
 catered
 event


to
 represent
 Ontario's
 interests
 in


Washington
 DC,
 for
 example,
 he's
 not


breaking
 the
 law
 if
 he
 eats
 a
 canopy,


you
 know.
 Um
 or
 you
 know
 another
 example


>> even
 takes
 a
 gift.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 value
 periodically
 you
 know


when
 a
 Toronto
 based
 sports
 team
 is


doing
 well
 right
 there's
 there's
 always


like
 some
 bet
 between
 you
 know
 like
 the


premier
 of
 Ontario
 or
 a
 premier
 of


another
 province
 or
 a
 a
 state
 governor


uh
 that
 you
 know
 somebody
 has
 to
 wear


the
 other's
 shirt
 if
 Toronto
 wins
 or


loses.


>> Jersey.


>> Sorry.
 Jersey.
 Yes.
 Uh
 this
 is
 what
 I


get.


And
 and
 so
 like
 if
 if
 Doug
 Ford
 were
 to


accept
 the
 gift
 of
 a
 jersey
 from
 the


governor
 of
 California
 or
 whatever,
 that


would
 not
 violate
 the
 law,
 right?
 So
 the


other
 exception,
 political
 parties
 are


allowed
 to
 provide
 uh
 gifts
 and
 other


benefits
 to
 their
 members.
 Uh
 so
 for


example,
 the
 Liberal
 Party
 could
 provide


money
 to
 top
 up
 an
 MPPP's
 salary
 if
 that


person
 was
 their
 leader.
 Uh
 they
 could


do
 that
 without
 breaking
 the
 law.
 And


third,
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 bit
 of
 a


catch-all
 term,
 the
 integrity


commissioner
 can
 determine
 that
 a
 gift


is
 okay
 if
 it
 won't
 give
 rise
 to
 the


perception
 of
 a
 conflict
 of
 interest.
 Uh


the
 this
 is
 important
 though
 because
 the


integrity
 commissioner
 does
 not
 actually


enforce
 the
 members
 integrity
 act
 in
 the


usual
 sense
 of
 the
 word,
 right?
 The
 you


know
 if
 an
 MPP
 believes
 that
 the
 law
 has


been
 broken,
 they
 ask
 the
 integrity


commissioner
 to
 conduct
 an


investigation.
 The
 commissioner
 then


reports
 back
 to
 the
 legislature
 whether


the
 law
 has
 been
 broken
 and
 it's
 up
 to


the
 legislature
 to
 determine
 whether
 the


MPP
 will
 be
 punished
 or
 not.
 So
 just
 to


bring
 it
 back
 to
 Kathleen's
 email,
 first


of
 all,
 the
 premier
 does
 not
 seem
 to


have
 broken
 any
 rules
 here.
 Even
 if
 he


were,
 it
 would
 be
 up
 to
 the
 legislature


to
 determine
 his
 ultimate
 punishment.


And
 I
 don't
 need
 to
 remind
 everybody


listening
 to
 this
 podcast
 that
 the
 Doug


Ford
 currently
 leads
 the
 party
 that


holds
 a
 very
 substantial
 majority
 in
 the


legislature.
 So
 I
 uh
 do
 not
 expect
 he


would
 be
 punished
 even
 if
 an
 integrity


commissioner
 report
 came
 out
 saying
 that


he
 had
 broken
 the
 law.


>> Kathleen's
 question
 is
 a
 good
 one


because
 once
 upon
 a
 time
 and
 it
 wasn't


that
 long
 ago,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 before


2015
 and
 I'll
 tell
 you
 how
 I
 remember


it's
 before
 2015.
 This
 was
 a
 thing
 in


the
 nation's
 capital
 because
 there
 was
 a


backbencher
 in
 the
 Liberal
 caucus,
 which


was
 the
 third
 place
 party
 in
 Parliament


at
 the
 time,
 a
 backbencher
 by
 the
 name


of
 Justin
 Trudeau,
 who
 was
 so
 famous


that
 he
 was
 being
 asked
 to
 speak
 at
 a


lot
 of
 events
 for
 which
 speaking
 fees


were
 paid.
 And
 when
 that
 emerged,
 it
 did


create
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 firestorm.


>> Yes.


>> Because
 people
 were
 saying
 exactly
 what


Kathleen
 was
 saying,
 namely,
 "Wait
 a


second,
 you're
 paid.
 this
 is
 presumably


part
 of
 your
 job
 as
 a
 paid
 member
 of


parliament
 to
 do
 this.
 And
 after
 that


sort
 of
 got
 out
 um
 Mr.
 Trudeau
 had
 to


stop
 taking
 speaking
 fees.
 And
 um
 and


then
 he
 won
 an
 election,
 became
 prime


minister,
 and
 he
 didn't
 need
 to
 worry


about
 it
 anymore
 after
 that.
 Anyway,


>> and
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 the
 history
 of


integrity
 rules
 and
 ethics
 rules
 both
 uh


federally
 and
 at
 Queens
 Park
 is


fascinating.
 The
 decisions
 and
 the


behaviors
 that
 used
 to
 be
 uh
 allowable


uh
 under
 provincial
 law
 uh
 today
 uh
 read


as
 kind
 of
 hilariously
 corrupt.
 Um
 and


so
 you
 know
 as
 you
 can
 probably
 guess


from
 my
 summary
 like
 the
 members


integrity
 act
 has
 some
 uh
 weaknesses
 in


terms
 of
 actually
 uh
 uh
 controlling
 the


behaviors
 of
 MPPPS
 but
 it
 is
 certainly


uh
 better
 than
 what
 has
 existed
 uh
 you


know
 again
 in
 the
 1960s
 and
 70s
 where


some
 of
 these
 stories
 uh
 come
 from.


>> There
 we
 go.
 Give
 the
 email
 address
 sir


and
 let's
 get
 out
 of
 here.


>> Yes
 absolutely.

 week's
 episode
 was

Production
 support

 TVO's

 services
 team.

>> Okay,
 the
 next
 thing
 I'm
 going
 to
 say
 is


to
 give
 props
 to
 our
 wonderful
 studio


crew
 for
 getting
 everything
 organized


here
 so
 we
 can
 do
 this.
 And
 I
 want
 to


give
 one
 person
 a
 shout
 out
 and
 I
 want


to
 give
 one
 person
 a
 shame.
 The
 shout


out
 goes
 to
 I
 don't
 Where's
 Tony
 Burke


right
 now?
 Tony,
 is
 he
 in
 the
 control


room?
 I'm
 giving
 a
 shout
 out
 to
 Tony


Burke
 because
 he's
 a
 big
 Montreal


Canadians
 fan
 and
 I
 suspect
 there
 was


nobody
 around
 TVO
 who
 was
 happier
 to
 see


Nick
 Suzuki
 tip
 that
 puck
 into
 the
 net


which
 saved
 our
 day
 against
 the
 Czech


Republic
 couple
 days
 ago
 which
 meant


that
 Mitch
 Mner
 could
 be
 the
 hero
 in


overtime.
 So
 that's
 my
 shout
 out
 and
 my


shame
 is
 this
 guy
 who
 didn't
 even
 watch


the
 game.
 How
 could
 you
 not
 watch
 the


game?
 That's
 pathetic.
 I
 was
 writing.
 I


was
 doing
 my
 duty
 to
 the
 people
 of


Ontario.


>> I
 don't
 care.
 You
 have
 a
 bigger
 duty
 as


a
 Canadian
 to
 be
 watching
 our
 men
 and


women
 in
 the
 gold
 medal.
 Well,
 it's
 not


gold
 medal
 yet,
 but
 in
 their
 quest
 for


gold.


>> It
 was
 one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 I
 was
 I


was,
 you
 know,
 as
 I
 I'm
 want
 to
 do
 even


when
 I'm
 writing.
 Uh
 I
 I
 was
 keeping
 an


eye
 on
 social
 media
 in
 case
 anything


blew
 up
 that
 I
 I
 missed.
 And
 it
 was
 one


of those
 things,
 you
 know,
 everybody's


talking
 about
 their
 own
 things
 on


Twitter
 and
 Blue
 Sky
 and
 all
 these
 other


places.
 Everybody
 has
 their
 own
 topics.


And
 then
 suddenly
 everybody
 was
 only


talking
 about
 one
 thing
 and
 it
 was
 this


game
 and
 I
 was
 like
 I
 should
 be
 paying


some
 attention
 to
 yes
 you
 should.


>> I
 was
 on
 deadline
 and
 I
 had
 to
 to
 write.


So
 no
 I
 was
 not
 able
 to
 watch
 the
 game.


>> You
 know
 John
 Michael
 if
 answered
 were


here
 it
 would
 say
 some
 honorable
 members


colon
 shame
 shame
 shame.
 Anyway
 you


still
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 redeem
 yourself


because
 there
 are
 god
 willing
 two
 more


games
 still
 to
 come.


>> Yes


>> we
 shall
 see.
 Anyway
 that's
 it
 for
 us


until
 next
 Friday
 everybody.
 Bye-bye.


>> Bye-bye.
