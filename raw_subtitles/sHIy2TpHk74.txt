>> Seconds
 away.
 The
 question
 is
 not
 if


they'll
 cut
 interest
 rates.
 The
 question


is
 by
 how
 much.


>> The
 answer
 to
 your
 question,
 John,
 is
 a


quarter
 percentage
 point
 cut
 as


expected,
 but
 Fed
 officials
 also
 see
 two


more
 cuts
 this
 year
 in
 October
 and


December.


>> It's
 Wednesday,
 September
 17th.
 The


Federal
 Open
 Market
 Committee
 has
 just


wrapped
 up
 their
 most
 recent
 meeting
 in


Washington
 DC.
 And
 after
 two
 days
 of


analyzing
 and
 debating
 and
 forecasting,


the
 committee
 voted
 to
 cut
 interest


rates
 by
 25
 basis
 points.


>> I
 remain
 squarely
 focused
 on
 achieving


our
 dual
 mandate
 goals
 of
 maximum


employment
 and
 stable
 prices
 for
 the


benefit
 of
 the
 American
 people.
 While


the
 unemployment
 rate
 remains
 low,
 it


has
 edged
 up.
 Job
 gains
 have
 slowed
 and


>> Yeah.
 It's
 the
 first
 time
 the
 Fed
 has


cut
 in
 over
 a
 year.
 move
 coming
 after


months
 of
 debate.
 And
 on
 the
 one
 hand,


the
 labor
 market
 is
 slowing,
 but
 on
 the


other
 hand,
 we're
 still
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 what
 the
 impact
 of
 the
 tariffs
 is
 on


prices
 and
 consumer
 spending
 is
 still


going
 strong,


>> right?
 You
 could
 make
 a
 convincing
 case


for
 deeper
 cuts,
 but
 you
 could
 also
 make


a
 case
 for
 even
 raising
 benchmark
 rates


at
 this
 point.
 And
 we
 don't
 tend
 to
 get


a
 lot
 of
 these
 types
 of
 Fed
 meetings


where
 the
 outcome
 is,
 you
 know,
 so


debatable.
 So,
 we
 have
 to
 ask,
 how
 did


the
 central
 bank
 actually
 make
 the


decision
 to
 cut?
 To
 do
 that,
 let's
 back


up
 six
 weeks
 to
 the
 beginning
 of
 August


and
 head
 north.
 In
 fact,
 we
 are
 going


3,000
 m
 north.


[Music]


>> I
 added
 to
 my
 collection
 of
 flies
 for


fly
 fishing
 yesterday.


>> Oh,
 I
 I
 am
 slightly
 obsessed
 with


fishing
 lures.
 I
 don't
 even
 fish.
 I
 I


don't
 know
 why.
 I
 just


>> I
 like
 to
 fish.


>> That's
 Mary
 Dailyaly,
 president
 of
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 Bank
 of
 San
 Francisco.


>> So,
 here's
 why
 I
 get
 these
 flies.
 I
 go


to
 places
 all
 over
 that
 have
 fly


fishing,
 and
 then
 I
 buy
 a
 fly
 that's


specific
 to
 their
 area
 to
 remind
 you.


It's
 sort
 of
 uh
 geeky,
 but
 it
 reminds
 me


that
 everybody
 fishes,
 but
 that
 you
 have


to
 have
 a
 local
 knowledge
 to
 fish.
 Well,


>> yeah.
 You
 have
 to
 have
 like
 the
 fly


that's
 in
 season
 for
 that
 particular


location.
 And
 it
 kind
 of
 is
 why
 you
 go


to
 the
 places
 to
 visit
 to
 learn
 more


about
 the
 economy.
 You
 sort
 of
 have
 to


you
 can
 understand
 it
 but
 you
 don't
 know


it
 until
 you
 have
 the
 locality.
 So
 you


don't
 do
 it
 well.


>> Daily
 oversees
 the
 12th
 district
 of
 the


Fed.
 It's
 the
 largest
 of
 the
 districts


and
 includes
 the
 nine
 most
 western
 US


states
 plus
 the
 most
 northern
 the
 last


frontier,
 the
 great
 land,
 the
 sourdough


state.
 I
 am
 talking
 about
 Alaska.


Obviously,


>> in
 early
 August,
 Mary
 Daly
 visited


Anchorage,
 the
 largest
 city
 and
 biggest


port
 in
 Alaska.
 It
 was
 actually
 her


third
 visit
 to
 the
 state
 this
 year.
 And


she's
 on
 a
 mission
 of
 sorts.


>> An
 expedition?


>> Sure.
 She's
 on
 a
 northern
 expedition
 to


try
 to
 find
 answers
 to
 the
 questions


that
 everyone,
 all
 Fed
 officials,


everyone
 else
 are
 trying
 to
 constantly


puzzle
 out
 right
 now.
 What
 is
 going
 on


with
 the
 US
 economy?
 Where
 is
 it
 headed?


I've
 heard
 that
 everywhere
 we've
 gone


that
 the
 city's
 under
 so
 much
 pressure


and
 it's
 hard
 to
 What
 is
 your
 diagnosis


about
 how
 this
 happened?


>> So,
 what
 was
 she
 seeing
 and
 how
 did
 it


actually
 inform
 the
 Fed's
 decision
 to


cut
 rates
 a
 month
 later?
 On
 this
 special


edition
 of
 the
 OddLotss
 podcast,
 we
 are


going
 to
 follow
 along
 as
 Daily
 tours
 her


district,
 speaking
 to
 local
 business


leaders
 like
 a
 factory
 that
 makes
 parts


for
 the
 oil
 industry


>> and
 the
 airport


>> and
 the
 port
 itself
 to
 try
 to
 get
 a


closer
 look
 at
 the
 giant
 logistics
 hub


that
 is
 the
 city
 of
 Anchorage.


[Music]


You
 know,
 every
 town
 in
 the
 world,
 I


think,
 probably
 likes
 to
 describe
 its


residents
 as
 quote
 scrappy
 unquote.
 But


this
 really
 is
 like
 the
 first
 place
 I've


been
 where
 I
 think
 that
 might
 actually


be
 true.
 People
 in
 Alaska
 really
 do
 seem


scrappy.


>> They
 have
 to
 be
 to
 get
 along
 up
 here.
 Uh


we
 really
 are
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 this
 vast


wilderness.
 In
 fact,
 one
 thing
 we


learned
 is
 that
 people
 up
 here
 love
 to


compare
 the
 size
 of
 their
 state
 to
 how


many
 Texases
 it
 would
 fit
 in,


>> which
 to
 be
 fair,
 Texans
 love
 to
 do
 that


stuff
 as
 well.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 the
 answer
 is
 two
 and
 a
 half.


By
 the
 way,
 Alaska
 is
 the
 size
 of
 two


and
 a
 half
 Texases.
 Okay.
 So,
 everyone


knows
 Alaska
 is
 big,
 but
 until
 you


visit,
 it's
 hard
 to
 really
 appreciate


just
 how
 big.
 The
 only
 way
 to
 get
 from


Anchorage,
 which
 is
 the
 largest
 city,
 to


Juno,
 which
 is
 the
 capital,
 is
 a
 2hour


plane
 ride.
 And
 if
 you
 want
 to
 haul


supplies
 from
 a
 place
 like
 Fairbanks,


which
 is
 in
 the
 interior,
 to
 the
 oil


fields
 on
 the
 North
 Slope,
 that
 is
 a


10-hour
 drive
 on
 what
 is
 mostly
 a
 dirt


road
 with
 one
 gas
 station
 on
 the
 way.


>> It's
 really
 isolated.
 Uh
 there's
 not


even
 a
 railroad
 that
 takes
 you
 to
 the


lower
 48
 or
 even
 to
 Canada.
 And
 there


are
 mountains
 that
 basically
 cut
 off


huge
 sections
 of
 the
 state
 from
 each


other.


>> But
 as
 we
 learned
 during
 our
 visit,


Alaska
 is
 still
 dealing
 with
 all
 the


same
 issues
 that
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 US


faces.
 So
 things
 like
 inflation,


unemployment,
 tariffs,
 housing


shortages,
 logistical
 snarls.


>> That's
 why
 Mary
 is
 here.
 I
 mean,
 to
 try


to
 get
 a
 handle
 on
 the
 broader
 US


economy
 by
 looking
 at
 a
 place
 that
 at


least
 right
 now
 is
 sort
 of
 ground
 zero


for
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 trends


>> is
 to
 collect
 information.
 So
 we
 collect


information
 not
 only
 on
 the
 wide
 array


of
 data
 that
 are
 available
 and
 then
 we


have
 history
 and
 models.
 We
 have
 all
 of


those
 things
 and
 then
 we
 have


conversations.


>> Today
 Mary
 is
 the
 guest
 of
 honor
 at
 the


Anchorage
 Economic
 Development


Corporation's
 annual
 gathering.
 The


Denina
 Convention
 Center
 downtown
 is


overflowing
 with
 more
 than
 1500
 local


business
 owners,
 politicians,
 civic


leaders.
 They're
 here
 to
 mingle,


network,
 talk
 shop,
 and
 hear
 Mary's


thoughts
 on
 where
 she
 thinks
 the
 economy


stands.
 as
 well
 as
 counting
 the
 cranes


as
 a
 future-looking
 variable
 is
 so


important.
 So,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 thank


everybody
 who's
 ever
 answered
 the
 beige


book,
 who's
 ever
 met
 with
 us.
 If
 you


like
 the
 beige
 book,
 we'll
 send
 you


another
 one.
 It
 used
 to
 be
 beige,
 by
 the


way.


>> So,
 this
 is
 the
 factf
 finding
 portion
 of


the
 expedition
 because
 yes,
 Mary
 is


giving
 a
 speech
 about
 what
 she's
 seeing


in
 the
 economy,
 but
 she's
 also
 learning


from
 the
 local
 businesses
 who
 are


listening
 to
 her.


>> And
 what
 I've
 been
 hearing
 is
 that
 the


uncertainty
 is
 the
 word
 of
 the
 day.
 I


guess
 it
 was
 on
 the
 bingo
 card.
 And


uncertainty
 makes
 it
 harder
 for
 firms


and
 households
 to
 know
 what
 they're


doing
 next,
 which
 makes
 it
 harder
 for
 us


as
 policy
 makers,
 Federal
 Reserve
 policy


makers,
 to
 know
 exactly
 how
 the
 economy


will
 evolve.


>> Mary
 isn't
 a
 voting
 member
 of
 the


committee
 this
 year,
 but
 as
 a
 reserve


bank
 president,
 she
 still
 participates


in
 all
 the
 FOMC
 meetings
 where
 she


offers
 her
 own
 assessments
 and
 opinions


based
 on
 what
 she's
 seeing
 in
 the


economy
 of
 the
 12th
 district
 right
 now.


And
 so
 her
 views
 still
 do
 help
 shape
 the


committee's
 decision


>> in
 all
 the
 states
 in
 my
 district
 on
 a


regular
 basis
 as
 are
 my
 teams.
 And
 the


reason
 for
 that
 is
 so
 that
 we
 can


understand
 firsthand
 what
 you
 are
 in


particularly
 thinking
 about,
 what
 you


see
 as
 your
 opportunities,
 what
 you
 see


as
 your
 challenges,
 but
 also
 how
 do
 you


see
 the
 economy
 today?
 You
 know,
 there's


an
 interesting
 statistic
 we
 just
 heard


that
 people
 feel
 decently
 pretty
 good


about
 their
 own
 situation,
 but


pessimistic
 about
 the
 economy.
 Well,
 we


we
 need
 to
 understand
 why.
 What
 are
 you


seeing
 as
 you
 look
 out?
 Businesses
 are


making
 decisions
 today
 about
 what


they're
 going
 to
 do
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.
 We
 need
 to
 know
 what
 those
 are.
 We


need
 to
 know
 what
 how
 households
 are


feeling.
 Are
 they
 feeling
 strapped?
 Are


they
 feeling
 like
 they
 have
 enough


disposable
 income?
 And
 the
 data
 alone,


looking
 at
 the
 published
 data,
 not
 you


know,
 all
 the
 micro
 data,
 you
 could
 look


at
 a
 hundred
 series
 and
 you
 would
 never


have
 the
 complete
 picture.
 I'm
 sure


we've
 all
 heard
 the
 phrase
 data


dependent
 and
 the
 Fed
 leans
 heavily
 on


the
 volumes
 and
 volumes
 of
 economic


statistics
 that
 get
 released
 every
 month


when
 making
 its
 decisions.
 But
 sometimes


you
 can
 augment
 that
 data
 with
 things


you
 observe
 on
 the
 ground.


>> Right?
 So
 just
 a
 few
 days
 before
 the


Alaska
 trip,
 we
 got
 a
 jobs
 report
 that


heavily
 revised
 down
 the
 employment


numbers
 from
 the
 earlier
 months.
 It
 was


a
 big
 surprise,
 huge
 moment
 for
 the


markets,
 but
 it
 didn't
 really
 surprise


Mary.


>> And
 what
 was
 interesting
 about
 the
 jobs


report
 on
 Friday
 is
 it
 better
 matched
 in


the
 direction
 of
 change,
 not
 in
 the


magnitude.
 It
 better
 match
 what
 I've


been
 hearing.
 And
 so
 a
 disciplining


device
 for
 data
 that
 you
 don't
 know
 if


they're
 really
 accurate,
 is
 what
 you


hear
 from
 people
 because
 people
 do
 not


tell
 you,
 I
 feel
 really,
 really


comfortable
 getting
 a
 job
 only
 to
 find


out
 that
 the
 job
 market
 report
 is
 bad.


What
 they
 will
 tell
 you
 is,
 "Boy,
 it


looks
 really
 worrisome
 out
 there."
 And


then
 you
 get
 a
 jobs
 report
 that
 doesn't


look
 like
 the
 rapid
 job
 growth.
 That
 was


the
 thing
 that
 was
 out
 of
 whack.
 The


rapid
 job
 growth
 from
 the
 month
 before


is
 what
 I
 said,
 "Well,
 really,
 that's


not
 what
 I'm
 hearing.
 What's
 the
 gap?"


And
 we
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 digging
 in


and
 unpacking
 that.
 But
 then
 when
 the


jobs
 market
 report
 got
 revised,
 I
 was


like, "Okay,
 that
 makes
 more
 sense."


Even


>> But
 of
 course,
 jobs
 aren't
 the
 only


thing
 the
 Fed
 cares
 about.
 Its
 mandate


is
 low
 unemployment
 and
 stable


inflation.
 And
 these
 things
 seem
 to
 be


operating
 at
 cross
 currents
 right
 now.


Inflation
 has
 been
 above
 the
 Fed's
 2%


target
 for
 a
 while.
 And
 the
 concern
 is


that
 with
 tariffs
 coming
 in
 from
 the


Trump
 administration,
 prices
 are
 just


going
 to
 go
 up
 further.


>> So
 to
 understand
 the
 risk
 here,
 we're


following
 Mary
 to
 the
 offices
 of


Northern
 Solutions.
 It's
 an
 Alaskan


company
 which
 makes
 components
 and
 parts


for
 the
 oil
 industry
 which
 is
 obviously


big
 business
 in
 the
 state.


>> Yeah.
 All
 the
 pipes
 and
 casings
 and


spools
 and
 valves
 and
 things
 like
 that.


>> And
 as
 you
 can
 imagine,
 steel
 is
 a


pretty
 key
 input
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 these


products.
 Since
 June,
 there's
 been
 a


whopping
 50%
 tariff
 on
 steel
 and


aluminum
 coming
 from
 abroad.


>> So
 if
 we
 compare
 21
 to
 today,
 it's


cheaper.


>> I
 see.
 If
 we
 compare
 today
 to
 23
 24,


yeah,
 it's
 small.


>> And
 companies
 like
 Northern
 Solutions


are
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 just
 how
 to


navigate
 all
 these
 new
 trade


restrictions.
 It's
 not
 as
 easy
 as
 just


say
 switching
 to
 a
 US
 supplier.


>> But
 if
 you
 do
 that
 and
 you
 can't
 get
 the


continuity,
 well
 then
 that's
 a
 cost
 to


you
 that
 not
 being
 back
 there.
 So
 it's
 a


it's
 really
 helpful
 for
 us
 to
 think


about
 when
 we
 try
 to
 think
 about
 the


effects
 of
 tariffs
 or
 the
 effects
 of


changes
 on
 any
 uh
 administration
 on
 your


industry.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 tariffs
 so


the
 tariffs
 balanced
 it.
 So
 I
 can
 go
 to


a
 US
 mill.
 I
 can
 go
 to
 a
 foreign
 mill


and
 I'm
 going
 to
 pay
 the
 same
 price
 now


with
 that
 tariff.
 But
 it's
 the
 industry


that
 mill's
 geared
 to
 and
 the
 lead
 time


of
 that
 steel
 that's
 the
 problem.
 Yeah.


And
 honestly,
 we
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 small


steel
 mills
 here
 in
 this
 country.
 A
 lot


of
 small
 ones.
 They're
 very
 very


specific
 to
 a
 certain
 industry.


>> In
 other
 words,
 all
 steel
 isn't
 equal


>> mills.
 So,
 there's
 mills
 all
 around
 the


world.
 Steel
 mills
 all
 around
 the
 world.


I
 can't
 use
 them
 all
 because
 of
 that,


because
 of
 their
 MTRS.
 Not
 country
 of


origin,
 just
 how
 well
 they
 do
 it.


>> Okay.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 steel
 that


comes
 into
 the
 US
 tubing
 that
 that
 comes


brought
 in
 as
 green
 tube
 that
 we
 heat


treated
 in
 the
 US.
 So
 that
 MTR
 is


generated
 from
 a
 US
 uh
 heat
 treat


facility
 and
 now
 it's
 51%
 American
 and


then
 you
 go
 all
 the
 stuff
 on
 it.


>> I
 see.


>> So
 when
 we
 we
 talk
 about
 metals
 that
 I


can
 use,
 they're
 all
 over
 the
 place,
 but


I
 can't
 use
 them
 all.


>> This
 is
 actually
 a
 really
 good
 example


of
 the
 kind
 of
 information
 that
 makes


Mary's
 visit
 so
 important.
 It's
 the
 kind


of
 thing
 that
 you
 can't
 really
 learn


from
 an
 economic
 data
 release.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 use
 that.
 One
 of
 the
 things


that
 I
 I
 just
 to
 show
 you
 how
 tell
 you


how
 we
 use
 things
 I've
 learned
 is
 that


if
 you
 think
 about
 how
 likely
 are
 we
 to


shift
 all
 of
 our
 production
 from
 the


United
 States
 or
 how
 likely
 is
 a
 global


market
 on
 steel
 to
 be
 able
 to
 re
 if
 we


put
 it
 all
 back
 today.
 I
 mean,
 you've


taught
 me
 two
 things
 already
 that
 not


everybody
 is
 geared
 to
 your
 industry
 and


you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 specific,
 you
 know,


heat
 strategy
 in
 order
 to
 even
 use
 the


materials
 and
 they
 have
 to
 be
 a
 certain


quality.
 So,
 it
 just
 means
 that
 you


don't
 have
 the
 open
 marketplace
 that
 I


think
 many
 people
 would
 think
 you
 have.


So,
 they
 would
 just
 look
 at
 the
 number


of
 manufacturers
 and
 they'd
 say,
 "Oh,


look,
 you
 could
 do
 all
 of
 this."
 But
 you


can't.
 There's
 barriers


>> there.
 There
 are
 barriers.


>> Very
 helpful.
 You
 know,
 there's
 another


big
 Alaskan
 business
 that's
 grappling


with
 tariffs,
 and
 that
 is
 the
 port.
 Next


stop,
 the
 Port
 of
 Alaska.


[Music]


Not
 many
 people
 have
 a
 demand
 for
 those


ships
 anymore.
 So
 they'll
 decommission


them
 as
 they


>> Yeah.
 Although
 I
 I'll
 say
 in
 Natson
 in


particular.
 So
 they
 have
 three
 ships


that
 they
 rotate
 between
 and
 u
 they
 have


>> the
 port
 of
 Alaska
 used
 to
 be
 called
 the


port
 of
 Anchorage
 by
 the
 way.
 Very
 cool.


It's
 a
 deep
 water
 port.
 The
 tides
 here


are
 crazy.
 Here's
 uh
 Jim
 Jagger,
 the


port's
 acting
 director,
 explaining
 what


they're
 having
 to
 deal
 with.


>> So,
 Port
 of
 Alaska
 has
 a
 variety
 of


issues
 that
 we're
 not
 unique,
 except


that
 we're
 unique
 in
 the
 combination
 of


issues
 we
 have.
 So,
 what
 are
 our


challenges?
 For
 instance,
 we
 have
 um
 a


pretty
 fast
 current.
 We
 have
 a
 30-ft


tide
 flux.
 Uh
 so,
 between
 low
 tide
 and


high
 tide,


>> 30
 foot.
 Then
 our
 maximum
 tide
 flux


between
 the
 lowest
 tide
 of
 the
 season


and
 the
 highest
 tide
 is
 40
 ft.


>> I
 heard
 it
 is
 the
 second
 biggest
 tide


flux
 in
 the
 world.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 actually
 depending
 on
 it.


It's it's
 probably
 fifth
 or
 sixth,
 but


in
 places
 where
 people
 actually
 do


commerce,
 we're
 number
 two.


>> So
 because
 of
 the
 harsh
 growing


conditions
 and
 the
 short
 summer
 season


in
 Alaska,
 almost
 all
 of
 the
 state's


fresh
 food
 has
 to
 be
 imported.
 And
 the


vast
 majority
 of
 that
 food
 arrives
 by


boat
 from
 west
 coast
 peers,
 mostly


Seattle
 and
 Tacoma.
 And
 with
 only
 four


ships
 coming
 in
 per
 week,
 Alaska's


supply
 lines
 are
 stretched
 very
 tight.


And
 Mary
 has
 actually
 experienced
 the


downside
 of
 those
 stretched
 supply
 lines


before.
 Here
 she
 is
 talking
 with
 Jim


about
 it.


>> Running
 out
 of
 things.
 We
 ran
 out
 of


this.
 When
 I
 was
 here
 in
 May,
 the
 hotel


ran
 out
 of
 coffee
 because
 they
 said
 the


supplier
 hadn't
 gotten
 it
 in
 and
 they


wouldn't
 get
 it
 until


>> in
 in
 May.
 We
 had
 we
 lost
 a
 ship
 because


of
 a
 mechanical.
 So,
 if
 your
 timing
 was


correct,
 you
 may
 have
 your
 coffee
 may


have
 been
 coming
 up.


>> Yeah,
 I
 went
 down
 for
 coffee
 and
 she


said,
 "We
 are
 we
 don't
 have
 any
 coffee


for


>> that
 actually
 demonstrates
 how
 skinny


our
 supply
 line."


>> Yeah.
 No,
 that's
 that
 that's
 why
 I


wanted
 to
 talk
 about
 it.
 Um
 I'm
 still


I'm
 not
 traumatized
 by
 my
 lack
 of


coffee,
 but
 I
 just
 was
 surprised
 at
 how


I
 was
 surprised
 at
 how
 fragile
 or


vulnerable.


>> We
 we
 have
 6
 to
 10
 days
 worth
 of
 food
 in


the
 States.
 So
 we
 import
 depending
 on


whose
 numbers
 you
 believe
 between
 94
 and


96%
 of
 the
 food
 consumed
 in
 Alaska
 is
 is


imported.
 Figure
 we're
 handling
 3/4
 of


that.
 Um
 so
 you
 know
 if
 that's
 coming
 in


we
 we
 have
 four
 scheduled
 container


ships
 a
 week.
 Two
 on
 Sundays,
 two
 on


Tuesdays.
 Um
 if
 we
 lose
 a
 ship,
 you
 know


that's
 25%
 of
 the
 food
 for
 the
 next


week.
 Uh
 and
 it
 is
 very
 realistic
 that


if
 you
 walk
 into
 the
 Fred
 Meyer
 grocery


store
 and
 you
 go,
 "Huh,
 why
 is
 there
 no


salad?
 you
 know,
 uh,
 that's
 why,
 and
 you


know,
 it's
 an
 interesting
 take.
 If
 you


go
 down
 to
 the
 lower
 48
 and
 say
 go
 to


Home
 Depot,
 Home
 Depot's
 lower
 48
 stores


have
 a
 restock
 where
 they
 can
 restock
 an


entire
 store
 in
 32
 hours.
 So,
 if
 you're


on
 the
 G
 Coast
 and
 they
 have
 a


hurricane,
 they
 completely
 sell
 the


store
 out.
 They're
 set
 up
 so
 that
 they


can
 come
 in
 32
 hours
 later,
 they're


totally
 restocked.
 Okay?
 Now
 apply
 that


model
 to
 Alaska
 where
 we
 have
 no


warehousing.
 32
 hours
 means
 if
 the
 if
 we


have
 an
 earthquake
 or
 something
 happens


here
 and
 they
 empty
 out
 the
 store,
 they


place
 the
 order.
 32
 hours
 to
 get
 it
 to


Tacoma
 on
 the
 dock.
 There's
 then
 a
 66


1/2
 hour
 float
 up
 to
 Anchorage
 and


that's
 assuming
 you're
 on
 the
 right


cycle
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 wait
 a


couple
 of
 days
 till
 the
 next
 ship


leaves.
 So,
 it
 gets
 up
 here
 in
 66
 and
 a


half
 hours
 and
 then
 it's
 got
 to
 make
 it


from
 Anchorage
 to
 wherever
 the
 final


destination
 is.
 So,
 if
 you're
 in
 Midtown


Anchorage,
 well,
 you'll
 be
 it'll
 be


there
 this
 afternoon.
 Uh
 if
 it's
 in


Fairbanks,
 well,
 that's
 another
 day.
 So,


suddenly
 your
 32-hour
 restock,
 you
 know,


could
 be
 six,
 seven
 days.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 a
 dumb
 question?
 But
 why
 don't


you
 build
 some
 warehousing
 capacity?


>> That
 was
 my
 question.


>> Well,


>> I
 don't
 think
 it's
 dumb.
 I
 was
 going
 to


ask.
 So
 our
 basic
 problem
 is
 that
 we


have
 a
 very
 small
 population
 spread
 out


over
 a
 huge
 area.
 You
 know
 3/4
 of
 a


million
 people
 in
 the
 entire
 state.
 So


basically
 a
 city,
 right?
 And
 our
 state


is
 two
 and
 a
 half
 times
 the
 size
 of


Texas.


>> But
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to
 see
 it,
 go
 to


Bush,
 Alaska.


>> That's
 John
 Daly,
 an
 engineer
 who
 is


leading
 a
 big
 modernization
 effort
 at


the
 port.


>> So
 go
 to
 these
 remote
 communities
 and


then
 you'll
 really
 see
 the
 effect
 of


what
 what
 you're
 talking
 about.
 But
 it's


uh
 it's
 pronounced
 if
 they
 if
 they
 get


some
 of
 these
 communities
 only
 get
 three


or
 four
 barges
 a
 year
 basically.
 Milk
 is


hugely
 expensive.
 Anything
 fresh
 is
 very


expensive.
 If
 you
 go
 to
 you
 know
 I've


worked
 living
 here
 I've
 worked
 in
 a
 lot


of
 remote
 places.
 We're
 talking
 Kodiak


or
 St.
 Paul
 Island
 or
 Bethl
 or


something.
 Then
 you
 really
 see
 the
 the


end
 of
 the
 supply
 chain
 and
 it's
 super


sensitive
 in
 those
 locations.
 So,
 it's


very
 it
 can
 be
 vulnerable
 here,
 but
 it's


sort
 of
 fragile
 over
 there.


>> More
 vulnerable.
 And
 we're
 kind
 of
 a


hub.
 It's
 a
 hub
 and
 spoke
 system.
 So,


we're
 a
 hub
 that
 helps
 supply
 those


areas.
 And
 if
 we're
 sensitive,
 they
 are


10
 times.


>> Yeah,
 that
 makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.


>> And
 now,
 just
 to
 make
 things
 even
 more


complicated,
 the
 port
 also
 has
 tariffs


to
 contend
 with.
 As
 the
 primary
 import


hub
 from
 the
 entire
 state,
 you
 can


imagine
 that
 the
 port
 thinks
 about
 this


issue
 quite
 a
 bit.
 Not
 only
 could


tariffs
 impact
 trade,
 all
 those
 ships


going
 in
 and
 out
 of
 the
 harbor,
 stopping


to
 refuel,
 so
 forth,
 but
 they
 could
 get


the
 first
 look
 at
 how
 companies
 choose


to
 respond
 to
 any
 increase
 in
 costs.


>> It
 also
 just
 as
 likely
 to
 push
 up
 the


price
 of
 goods.
 Oh,
 yeah.


>> So,
 they're
 going
 to
 face
 tariffs
 on


goods,
 but
 they're
 also
 going
 to
 face


port
 fees
 on
 goods.
 And
 so,
 then
 it's


just
 be
 more
 expensive.


>> It
 gets
 worse,
 though,
 because
 we
 have


we
 have
 the
 the
 death
 spiral.
 So,
 we


raise
 our
 tariffs
 and
 then
 right
 now


most
 of
 the
 cargo
 coming
 in
 are
 deep


water
 vessels.
 But
 if
 we
 raise
 our


tariffs
 per
 ton
 enough,
 uh,
 at
 some


point
 some
 folks
 who
 are
 shipping
 things


that
 are
 not
 timesensitive,
 new
 cars,


you
 know,
 we'll
 go,
 you
 know,
 for
 the


tariff,
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 bring
 it
 up
 on


a
 on
 a
 barge
 into
 Whittier


>> and
 I'll
 save
 the
 tariff.


>> And
 then
 what
 happens
 is
 that
 then


reduces
 our
 overall
 tonnage.
 We
 still


have
 to
 make
 our
 debt
 payment.
 So,
 we


now
 have
 to
 increase
 our
 tariffs
 more.


So,
 we're
 getting
 into
 this
 spiral.
 Food


prices
 just
 went
 up
 even
 more.
 And
 oh,


by
 the
 way,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 you're
 not


paying
 the
 tariff
 on
 your
 truck,
 but
 you


are
 going
 to
 get
 it
 10
 days
 later
 than


you
 thought
 you
 were.
 You
 know,
 so


you're
 getting
 worse
 cargo
 service
 also.


So,
 the
 impact
 on
 Alaskans
 is
 they're


paying
 more
 for
 certain
 things
 like


food,
 uh,
 and
 everything
 else
 is
 the


cargo
 service
 is
 less
 good.
 Well,
 the


the
 normal
 way
 that
 all
 this
 any
 kind
 of


extra
 tax
 ships
 out
 is
 you
 either
 wait


longer
 or
 you
 pay
 more.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 that's
 just
 how
 it
 works.
 I
 mean,


in
 any
 of
 the
 things
 that's
 why
 I
 tried


to
 put
 a
 optimistic
 uh


>> end
 point
 on
 the
 speech
 is
 because
 you


can
 I
 think
 ultimately
 it's
 you
 guys
 are


very
 enthusiastic
 about
 what
 you're


trying
 to
 do,
 but
 there's
 the
 other
 side


of
 it
 which
 can
 easily
 demoralize


people,
 right?
 It
 just
 seems
 like
 an


insurmountable
 problem
 when
 you
 think
 of


the
 cost
 structure
 here.
 But
 we
 have
 no


option.


>> No.
 Exactly.
 So
 you
 can
 either
 back


yourself
 into
 a
 corner
 with
 no
 option
 or


you
 can
 just
 say
 well


>> and
 be
 sad,
 right?
 Or
 you
 can
 just
 go


forward
 with
 purpose,
 right?
 So
 yeah,


>> it's
 sort
 of
 common
 knowledge
 that
 it's


expensive
 to
 live
 in
 Alaska.
 It
 just


costs
 more
 to
 get
 goods
 and
 services
 up


here.
 And
 residents
 understand
 that's


part
 of
 the
 deal.
 But
 there
 are
 limits


to
 just
 how
 much
 of
 a
 premium
 Alaskans


are
 willing
 to
 pay
 to
 live
 here
 and
 just


how
 much
 businesses
 can
 get
 away
 with


when
 it
 comes
 to
 pricing.
 Cheryl


Beckham,
 director
 of
 finance
 at
 the
 Port


of
 Alaska,
 talks
 about
 this
 point
 with


Mary.
 I
 mean,


>> I'm
 revealing
 my
 economist
 background,


but
 it
 just
 makes
 sense
 that
 the
 price


would
 be
 higher
 here
 because
 you
 have


all
 these
 additional
 costs,
 but
 you're


saying
 the
 small
 communities
 think
 it


should
 be
 like
 it
 is
 in
 the
 lower
 48.


So,
 you
 have
 to
 split
 this
 difference.


>> So,
 there's
 a
 similar
 So,
 they


understand
 that
 there's
 a
 transportation


cost,
 but
 what
 is
 that
 market
 that


they're
 willing
 to
 accept,
 right?
 So
 as


costs
 go
 up
 and
 fuel
 goes
 up
 and
 the
 you


know
 the
 fuel
 bars
 the
 tankers
 that


bring
 it


>> they
 cost
 more
 for


>> So
 you're
 probably
 always
 having
 a


little
 less
 margin
 up
 here.


>> Right.
 Yes.


>> Right.
 So
 you
 do
 this
 is
 the
 really
 big


question.
 How
 much
 of
 the
 extra
 cost


coming
 from
 the
 tariffs
 is
 going
 to
 be


absorbed
 by
 the
 companies
 themselves


whether
 it's
 importers
 or
 the


transportation
 businesses
 or
 middlemen


like
 the
 port.
 and
 how
 much
 of
 the
 cost


is
 going
 to
 be
 passed
 on
 to
 consumers


which
 would
 basically
 risk
 fanning


inflation
 again.


>> And
 that
 is
 a
 big
 deal
 for
 a
 state
 which


already
 has
 a
 very
 high
 cost
 of
 living


precisely
 because
 all
 this
 stuff
 needs


to
 be
 imported
 and
 often
 sent
 on
 to


really
 remote
 locations
 within
 the


state.
 And
 even
 if
 you're
 not


necessarily
 importing
 foreign
 goods,


tariffs
 can
 still
 push
 up
 the
 price
 of


what's
 made
 domestically.
 question
 that


we're
 grappling
 with
 making
 monetary


policy
 is
 there's
 taxes,
 immigration,


deregulation,
 tariffs
 and
 those
 things


have
 different
 likely
 effects
 etc.
 So


one
 of the
 questions
 I've
 been
 asking


people
 when
 we
 meet
 is
 do
 any
 of
 those


things
 can
 you
 see
 any
 of
 those
 effects


immediately
 affecting
 your
 business
 here


and
 do
 you
 have
 any
 sense
 of
 if
 they


will?
 up
 immediately.
 Uh


>> well,
 the
 tariff
 thing
 has
 come
 up
 in


our
 construction.
 So,
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


big
 construction
 coming
 up
 like
 a
 couple


billion
 dollars
 worth
 of
 infrastructure.


>> Sorry.
 Is
 that
 port
 specific?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 our
 dock
 replacement.


>> Okay.
 Right.


>> And
 and
 most
 of
 that
 is
 by
 America


uh
 because
 we're
 trying
 to
 get
 federal


funding
 and
 that
 comes
 with
 the


territory.


>> So,
 the
 tariffs
 are
 not
 directly


affecting
 that
 because
 theoretically


that's
 on
 foreign
 goods.
 However,
 it


floats
 the
 whole


>> pushes
 the
 whole
 district


>> the
 whole
 harbor
 up.
 So
 the
 price
 of


steel,
 buy
 America
 steel,
 buy
 America


this,
 buy
 America
 that
 all
 goes
 up.
 So


it
 has
 a
 a
 large
 effect
 on
 on
 that.


>> How
 how
 much
 have
 you
 seen
 prices
 rise


maybe
 from
 when
 you
 originally
 planning


it?


>> I
 mean
 something
 rough.


>> No,
 I
 want
 to
 admit
 that
 number,
 but


it's
 a
 large
 number.
 Um,


>> right.
 We
 started
 off
 10
 years
 ago
 with


uh
 something
 that
 was
 $400
 million
 and


we're
 at
 two
 and
 a
 half
 billion
 now.


>> Right.
 The
 Port
 of
 Alaska
 is
 in
 the


middle
 of
 a
 $2.5
 billion
 modernization


program.
 So
 it's
 a
 pretty
 bad
 time
 for


the
 cost
 of
 materials
 to
 be
 going
 up
 and


there's
 also
 the
 financing
 costs
 right


if
 interest
 rates
 go
 up
 because


inflation
 is
 rising
 that
 also
 adds
 to


the
 cost
 possibly
 exponentially.
 So
 can


I
 ask
 a
 question
 about
 from
 all
 three
 of


you
 is
 like
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 work


you
 do
 here
 and
 the
 things
 that
 are


facing
 Alaska
 with
 all
 the
 you
 know
 just


the
 economy
 the
 changes
 in
 policy


interest
 rates
 etc.
 What
 what's
 worrying


you
 right
 now?


>> What
 worries
 me
 is
 financing
 our
 our


project
 our
 $2.5
 billion
 dollar
 project


trying
 and
 we
 have
 some
 state
 and


federal
 funds.
 The
 rest
 of
 it
 is
 slated


for
 uh
 local
 revenue
 bonds.


>> Okay.


>> And
 that's


>> Do
 you
 think
 those
 will
 pass?


>> They've
 given
 us
 authority
 to
 issue


those.
 But
 the
 question
 is
 how
 how
 much


can
 you
 push
 into
 the
 market
 um


>> once


>> and
 it
 puts
 our
 debt
 load
 from
 whatever


it
 is
 50
 million
 we
 have
 now
 up
 to


>> billions.
 1.1
 we
 have
 authority
 for
 1.1


billion.


>> It
 greatly
 increases
 our
 debt
 load.
 So


that's
 the
 biggest.
 So
 our
 our
 goal
 is


one
 third
 one
 third
 one
 third
 one
 third


federal
 money
 one/3
 state
 money
 1/3


local
 money
 for
 our
 ne
 our
 next
 doc
 it's


going
 to
 be
 roughly
 $900
 million
 right


at
 this
 point
 we
 have
 90%
 is
 going
 to
 be


local
 5%
 state
 5%
 federal.
 If
 we
 go


forward
 to
 finance
 the
 90%
 that's
 the


local
 share
 uh
 after
 40
 years
 2.2


uh
 2.28


uh
 billion
 dollars
 is
 what
 we're
 going


to
 pay
 back
 for
 900
 billion.
 So
 you
 know


with
 that
 the
 cost
 of
 financing
 is
 going


to
 be
 huge
 and
 what
 is
 that
 going
 to
 do


to
 overall
 cargo
 rates?
 Remember,
 one
 of


our
 things
 is
 we're
 trying
 to
 maintain
 a


cost-effective
 cargo
 system.
 Uh,
 and


boy,
 when
 do
 we
 get
 crushed?


>> Speaking
 of
 effective
 cargo
 systems,
 a


huge
 chunk
 of
 Alaska's
 imports
 go


through
 the
 port,
 as
 we've
 been


discussing.
 But
 it
 is
 not
 the
 only


logistics
 hub
 in
 town.


>> Right.
 To
 get
 a
 complete
 picture,
 we've


got
 to
 check
 out
 the
 airport,
 which
 is


exactly
 where
 Mary
 is
 heading
 next.


>> How
 much
 would
 a
 plane
 like
 that
 cost?


>> 3
 million.


>> Yeah,


>> that's
 you
 lightly
 used.


>> 3.8.


>> We
 have
 We
 have
 a
 We
 have
 a
 handful
 of


those.
 Yeah.


>> What
 are
 the
 planes
 that
 go
 out


completely?


>> Um,
 I'm
 Susan
 Alt.
 from
 the
 Alaska


International
 Airport's
 system


controller
 and
 we're
 all
 glad
 to
 have


you
 here
 today
 to
 show
 off
 our
 system.


Uh
 so
 I'll
 go
 ahead
 and
 get
 going.
 So


what
 is
 the
 Alaska
 International
 Airport


System,
 also
 known
 as
 AAS?
 It
 is
 made
 up


of
 Ted
 Stevens
 Anchorage
 International


Airport,
 which
 is
 the
 largest
 passenger


airport
 in
 the
 state
 of
 Alaska.
 It's


also
 the
 fourth
 busiest
 cargo
 airport
 in


the
 world
 and
 the
 second
 busiest
 in
 the


United
 States.
 Anchorage's
 impact
 is
 the


largest
 airport
 in
 Alaska.
 Passenger


activity
 for
 fiscal
 year
 25
 ended
 at
 4,


excuse
 me,
 5.4
 million
 passengers


served.
 Air
 cargo
 for
 2025.
 We
 had
 3.7


million
 tons
 um
 for
 2025.
 And
 again,
 as


I
 said,
 we're
 number
 two
 in
 the
 USA
 and


number
 four
 in
 the
 world
 with
 regards
 to


cargo.
 Um,
 we
 support
 one
 in
 seven
 jobs


in
 the
 Anchorage
 area
 and
 provide
 1.8


billion
 in
 annual
 economic
 impact
 to
 the


state.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 on
 the
 screen


about
 the
 direct
 jobs
 and
 wages
 impact


versus
 the
 indirect
 and
 induced
 uh
 jobs


and
 wages.
 So,
 we're
 pretty
 significant


economic
 boom
 for
 the
 state
 of
 Alaska.


>> Air
 transport
 is
 huge
 for
 Alaska
 and
 the


Anchorage
 airport
 basically
 acts
 like
 a


truck
 stop
 for
 the
 whole
 state
 and


really
 global
 trade.
 Fully
 loaded
 cargo


planes
 moving
 stuff
 from
 Asia,
 the


Middle
 East,
 parts
 of
 Europe
 will
 stop


here
 to
 refuel
 on
 their
 way
 to
 the
 rest


of
 North
 America.
 And
 for
 Alaskans,
 it's


the
 main
 depot
 for
 most
 of
 the
 goods


they
 order
 from
 elsewhere,
 which
 are


sorted
 in
 the
 huge
 FedEx
 and
 UPS
 hangers


before
 being
 distributed
 throughout
 the


state.
 It's
 also
 a
 commuter
 hub.
 Many
 of


the
 oil
 workers
 on
 the
 North
 Slope
 work


in
 two
 week
 on,
 two
 week
 off
 shifts.


They
 catch
 a
 small
 plane
 up
 to
 the


fields
 where
 they
 live
 in
 company


housing
 while
 on
 the
 job
 and
 then
 they


return
 to
 their
 families
 and
 hometown


for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 month.


>> Effectively
 use
 that
 as
 a
 suburb.


Suburban.
 How
 many


people?


>> Yeah.
 So
 this
 is
 the
 conical
 Phillips
 if


you
 come
 from


>> airplane
 that's
 going
 up
 to
 north
 slope.


So
 if
 you're
 a
 slip
 worker
 and
 you
 work


2
 weeks
 on
 two
 weeks
 off
 really


>> you
 can
 live
 in
 Kenai
 have
 a
 nice
 Alaska


lifestyle
 over
 there
 hop
 on
 a
 grand


aviation


>> plane
 up
 in
 35
 minutes
 you're
 at
 the


door
 you
 walk
 over
 the
 next
 terminal
 and


get
 on
 your
 north


>> slope
 like
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 country


housing
 is
 a
 major
 issue
 even
 in
 a
 state


with
 say
 it
 with
 me
 Joe
 twice
 the
 land


of
 Texas


>> yeah
 as
 we've
 seen
 over
 and
 over
 Alaska


faces
 all
 the
 issues
 that
 the
 rest
 of


the
 US
 does
 only
 at least
 right
 now
 more


acutely
 there's
 a
 variety
 of
 other


things
 going
 on
 and
 if
 you're
 already


your
 infrastructure
 is
 already
 a
 little


vulnerable
 then
 you
 you
 can
 imagine
 any


shock
 we
 get
 in
 the
 United
 States
 just


in
 that
 I
 mean
 sorry
 to
 the
 United


States
 you
 get
 it
 amplified


>> yeah
 no
 that
 that's
 absolutely
 true
 and


>> so
 leading
 indicator
 which
 helps
 me
 make


good
 decisions
 when
 I
 talk
 to
 all
 of
 you


[Music]


>> Mary
 is
 going
 straight
 from
 the
 airport


to
 the
 airport
 I
 guess
 she's
 flying
 to


the
 lower
 48
 and
 there's
 obviously
 a
 lot


of
 possible
 takeaways
 from
 the
 trip.


>> You
 this
 cost
 structure
 of
 Alaska
 was


something
 I
 think
 we
 learned
 the
 most


about
 today.
 Just
 why
 are
 the
 prices
 so


much
 higher
 and
 where
 would
 you
 ever
 try


to
 mitigate
 that?
 And
 of
 course
 the


things
 that
 are
 going
 on
 like
 inflation


or
 just
 changes
 in
 how
 goods
 are
 shipped


or
 supply
 chain
 challenges,
 they're
 just


magnified
 in
 Alaska.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 also


learned,
 you
 know,
 I
 learned
 that
 they


happen
 here
 first.
 It's
 it
 really
 is


sort
 of
 this
 canary
 in
 the
 coal
 mine


almost
 that
 when
 you
 see
 it
 here,
 you


know
 it's
 coming
 elsewhere.
 It's
 going


to
 be
 lower
 in
 all
 likelihood
 because


there's
 other
 ways
 to
 ensure
 yourselves,


but
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 it.
 We
 don't


know
 exactly
 what
 was
 discussed
 at
 the


Fed's
 September
 meeting,
 or
 at
 least
 we


don't
 know
 until
 the
 transcript
 is


published
 in
 like
 2030,
 but
 I
 think
 you


can
 get
 a
 good
 sense
 of
 what
 a
 trip
 like


this
 actually
 adds
 to
 the
 conversation


when
 Fed
 governors
 are
 all
 sitting


around
 the
 table
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


what
 to
 do
 next.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 things


that
 is
 challenging
 right
 now,
 it
 was


challenging
 back
 in
 the
 days
 when
 we


were
 trying
 to
 fight
 high
 inflation
 and


it's
 definitely
 challenging
 today
 when


you're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 the
 real


impact
 of
 tariffs
 not
 not
 only
 on
 growth


but
 on
 the
 on
 inflation
 as
 just
 one


example
 unpacking
 what's
 happening
 in


Alaska
 and
 knowing
 at
 whatever
 point
 how


long
 this
 is
 going
 to
 take
 because
 of


the
 you
 know
 the
 nonf
 fungeability
 of


steel
 the
 interoperability
 of
 some
 of


the
 supply
 chain
 networks
 all
 of
 those


things
 give
 me
 insights
 that
 I
 can
 then


take
 back
 to
 the
 meeting
 and
 then
 it's


not
 just
 us
 exchanging
 forecast.
 I
 think


they're
 going
 to
 be
 like
 this
 long.
 I


think
 they're
 going
 to
 take
 this
 long.


It
 provides
 evidence,
 underlying


evidence
 that
 you
 can't
 find
 in
 your


statistics
 because
 the
 statistics
 we
 the


statistics
 we
 just
 don't
 know.
 All
 we're


doing
 is
 projecting.
 But
 now
 we
 have
 our


projections
 filled
 out
 by
 data
 and


information.
 And
 that
 makes
 a
 huge


difference
 when
 you're
 trying
 to
 make


good
 policy.


[Music]


That's
 it
 for
 our
 special
 Alaska


episode.
 We
 hope
 you
 enjoyed
 tagging


along
 with
 us
 and
 Mary
 on
 the
 Anchorage


Expedition.


>> Joe,
 what
 stuck
 out
 to
 you?


>> So
 many
 things
 stuck
 out
 to
 me
 from
 that


trip.
 You
 know,
 like
 being
 in
 Alaska,
 it


really
 did
 feel
 like
 the
 end
 of
 the


world,
 didn't
 it?
 like
 that
 that
 the


edge
 of
 the
 empire
 here.


>> Yeah,
 it
 definitely
 felt
 frontier-
 like


for
 sure.


>> I've
 been
 in
 rural
 areas
 before,
 even


more
 rural
 obviously
 than
 uh
 an
 urban


area
 like
 Anchorage,
 but
 I've
 never
 just


felt
 distant
 like
 I
 did
 in
 Alaska.
 And


so,
 it's
 very
 easy
 to
 understand
 why


it's
 a
 state
 permanently
 in
 a
 state
 of


sort
 of
 supply
 chain
 stress.
 Yeah,


that's
 what
 really
 stood
 out
 to
 me
 as


well
 because
 when
 you
 go
 to
 a
 place
 like


Anchorage,
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 the


same
 restaurants
 and
 chain
 stores
 that


you
 would
 see
 in
 any
 other
 place
 in


America,
 the
 difference
 is
 all
 that


stuff
 has
 to
 be
 transported
 thousands


and
 thousands
 of
 miles
 to
 get
 there.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 it's
 a
 constant
 strain.
 Uh


just
 extraordinary.
 You
 know,
 I
 knew


these
 things
 about
 how
 far-flung


everything
 was,
 but
 then
 say
 going
 to


the
 airport
 and
 seeing
 how
 small
 planes


served
 the
 just
 sort
 of
 worker
 commuter


system
 was
 really
 eye
 opening.
 Or
 just


the
 sheer
 number
 of
 people
 who
 own


planes
 themselves,
 you
 know,
 like
 they


have
 uh
 these
 uh
 uh
 pontoon
 planes
 in


the
 water
 that
 in
 another
 state
 would
 be


how
 people
 would
 have
 their
 boats
 in
 the


marina
 except
 Alaska.
 It's
 planned.
 Like


it's
 just
 it's
 permanently
 it's


permanently
 stretched.
 Do
 you
 uh
 think


we
 could
 go
 to
 Hawaii
 next?
 That's
 in


the
 12th
 district,
 right?


>> Uh
 let's
 do
 it.
 I'm
 down.


>> Shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?


>> Let's
 leave
 it
 there.
