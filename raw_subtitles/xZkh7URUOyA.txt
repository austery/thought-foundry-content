One
 year
 ago,
 I
 started
 a
 YouTube


channel.
 Today,
 we're
 at
 55,000


subscribers.
 Thank
 you
 to
 every
 single


one
 of
 you
 for
 being
 with
 us
 this
 year.


Today,
 we're
 letting
 you
 in
 on
 what's


happening
 behind
 the
 scenes,
 how
 this


channel
 was
 built,
 how
 it
 took
 off,
 what


is
 happening
 behind
 the
 scenes,
 how


we're
 prepping
 everything,
 what's
 going


to
 happen
 next
 year,
 and
 basically


answering
 all
 of
 your
 questions
 that
 you


have
 been
 asking
 under
 the
 posts.
 This


last
 year
 was
 definitely
 one
 of
 the
 most


difficult
 and
 exciting
 years
 of
 my
 life


and
 I
 want
 to
 break
 it
 down
 into
 four


chapters.
 So,
 we're
 starting
 with
 the


first
 one,
 how
 it
 started.


The
 reason
 I
 started
 this
 channel
 is


because
 I
 had
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time


working
 in
 tech
 and
 I
 think
 that
 tech
 is


full
 of
 fascinating
 stories.
 The


business
 of
 technology
 is
 full
 of


fascinating
 stories
 that
 are
 not
 really


being
 told
 in
 a
 way
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 people


would
 listen
 and
 engage.
 And
 I
 wanted
 to


bring
 these
 stories
 to
 life
 and
 combine


them
 with
 research.
 One
 of
 the
 things


that
 I
 think
 I'm
 more
 or
 less
 good
 at
 is


doing
 research.
 And
 I
 thought
 that
 if
 I


can
 combine
 hardcore
 research
 with
 my


experience
 in
 tech
 and
 cinematic


storytelling,
 it
 would
 be
 something
 that


I
 am
 personally
 looking
 for
 on
 YouTube


and
 something
 that
 I
 would
 want
 to


listen
 to.
 Our
 first
 video
 came
 out
 on


December
 9th,
 2024.
 And
 all
 I
 had
 was


this
 mic
 and
 the
 cheapest
 set
 of
 soft


boxes
 and
 my
 iPhone
 13,
 which
 I
 don't


have
 on
 me
 right
 now,
 but
 it's
 not
 a
 new


iPhone.
 If
 there
 is
 one
 thing
 that


describes
 my
 personality
 in
 one


sentence,
 it's
 how
 I
 used
 this
 mic.
 So,


get
 this.
 I
 got
 it
 and
 this
 is
 the
 first


microphone
 that
 I've
 ever
 owned.
 For
 the


first
 seven
 videos
 that
 I
 filmed,
 I
 did


not
 even
 bother
 reading
 instructions.
 I


quite
 literally
 took
 it
 out
 of
 the
 box.


I
 connected
 it
 to
 my
 laptop.
 I
 called
 my


friends
 and
 I
 actually
 tried
 testing


this
 mic
 with
 my
 friends.
 And
 for
 the


first
 5
 minutes,
 turned
 out
 that
 it
 was


not
 it
 was
 not
 even
 plugged
 in.
 So,
 I
 am


that
 person
 who
 doesn't
 read


instructions.
 For
 the
 first
 seven


videos,
 I
 had
 terrible
 possives.
 And
 the


sound
 was
 absolutely
 disgusting
 because


I
 did
 not
 even
 read
 it
 cuz
 I
 was
 like,


if
 I
 need
 to
 do
 it,
 I'm
 going
 to
 sit


down
 and
 do
 it.
 I
 have
 to
 start


recording.
 It
 doesn't
 matter
 how
 it


sounds.
 It
 doesn't
 matter
 how
 it
 looks.


I
 just
 got
 to
 do
 it.
 So,
 that's


basically
 me
 in
 a
 nutshell.
 Now,
 when


you
 start
 doing
 YouTube
 for
 the
 first


time,
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 content
 on


YouTube
 about
 how
 to
 do
 YouTube.
 And
 I


got
 to
 say
 that
 one
 of
 the
 most
 helpful


tips
 that
 I
 learned
 at
 the
 very


beginning
 of
 my
 journey
 was
 actually


from
 Ali
 Abdal.
 Uh
 he
 had
 a
 video
 where


he
 talked
 about
 how
 to
 start
 a
 channel.


And
 he
 said
 that
 he
 was
 like,
 "You
 just


got
 to
 start.
 It
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 you


talk
 about.
 It
 doesn't
 matter
 what
 it


is.
 You
 just
 pick
 a
 topic,
 any
 topic,


start
 recording,
 start
 doing
 something."


So
 back
 when
 I
 started,
 I
 honestly
 had


no
 idea
 how
 many
 videos
 were
 enough
 for


a
 new
 channel.
 So
 I
 was
 like, "Well,
 you


know
 what?
 how
 about
 I
 do
 three
 a
 week?


And
 I'm
 like,
 well,
 yeah,
 I
 think
 three


is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 stretch,
 but
 I


mean,
 it's
 doable,
 right?
 Like
 three


videos,
 if
 I
 just
 sit
 down
 and
 I
 do


everything
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 record


myself
 and
 it's
 just
 like,
 what's
 so


difficult
 about
 it?
 So,
 in
 December


2024,
 I
 did
 12
 videos.
 Every
 single


video
 was
 about
 20
 minutes.
 I
 did


everything
 by
 myself
 from
 uh
 research
 to


script
 writing
 to
 filming
 to
 editing.


Every
 single
 thing
 was
 done
 by
 me.
 and
 I


released
 12
 of
 those.
 Now,
 if
 you
 know


anything
 about
 video
 production,
 you


might
 be
 listening
 to
 this
 and
 be
 like,


"How
 on
 earth
 did
 you
 do
 12?"
 Because


it's
 a
 lot
 of
 work.
 If
 I'm
 being
 honest,


looking
 back,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 on
 earth


I
 did
 12.
 Right
 now,
 I
 have
 a
 team
 and
 I


cannot
 imagine
 doing
 12
 videos
 a
 month.


Like,
 I
 would
 have
 to
 quit
 my
 job.
 I


would
 have
 to
 not
 sleep
 at
 night
 to


release
 12
 a
 month.
 But
 at
 the
 time
 when


I
 just
 started,
 I
 thought
 it
 was


difficult,
 but
 I
 was
 like,
 you
 know


what,
 it's
 doable.
 Because
 I
 had
 to


start
 somewhere.
 I
 started
 with
 what
 I


do
 for
 a
 living
 with
 what
 I
 know
 best,


which
 is
 product
 management
 for


software.
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 things


that
 were
 top
 of-
 mind
 for
 me
 at
 the


time,
 uh,
 from
 interviewing
 to,
 um,


doing
 certain
 techniques
 or
 tactics


during
 my
 day
 job.
 And
 then
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 was
 really
 interested
 in


at
 the
 time
 was
 that
 I
 was
 exploring


international
 job
 market.
 I
 have
 been


trying
 to
 move
 to
 a
 different
 country


for
 several
 years
 and
 I
 have
 explored


all
 kinds
 of
 tech
 markets
 and
 I
 really


did
 my
 research.
 I
 tried
 the
 Gulf,
 I


tried
 the
 US,
 I
 thought
 about
 Europe


potentially.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 videos
 that


I
 was
 producing
 at
 the
 very
 beginning
 of


the
 channel
 were
 very
 much
 connected
 to


things
 that
 I
 was
 really
 focused
 on


because
 for
 me
 top
 of
 mind
 was
 moving


and
 that
 is
 how
 the
 where
 to
 run
 series


was
 born.
 the
 content
 was
 really


resonating
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 and
 that


was
 the
 first
 time
 when
 the
 channel
 took


off
 uh
 because
 I
 was
 covering
 countries


not
 just
 on
 a
 job
 specific
 level
 like


what
 it's
 like
 to
 be
 a
 PM
 in
 England
 for


example
 but
 I
 was
 doing
 incredibly
 deep


dives
 into
 tech
 markets
 in
 the


post-pandemic
 post
 layoff
 AI
 first


economy
 which
 I
 would
 like
 to
 emphasize


one
 more
 time
 is
 incredibly
 important


because
 the
 job
 market
 that
 we're
 seeing


today
 is
 not
 the
 same
 job
 market
 that


was
 happening
 four
 or
 5
 years
 ago.
 So
 I


was
 looking
 for
 content
 online
 where
 I


could
 see
 what's
 happening
 across
 the


globe
 or
 across
 the
 countries
 that
 I
 was


interested
 in
 on
 a
 very
 deep
 level
 like


what
 it's
 like
 to
 work
 there,
 what
 it's


like
 to
 live
 there,
 what
 what
 are
 the


pros
 and
 cons
 and
 I
 was
 looking
 for
 that


kind
 of
 content
 and
 I
 wasn't
 able
 to


find
 it.
 So
 I
 started
 creating
 it
 and


that
 seemed
 to
 really
 resonate
 with
 a


lot
 of
 people
 because
 that
 was
 the
 first


time
 when
 uh
 the
 channel
 really
 started


getting
 a
 lot
 of
 subscribers
 and
 we
 were


getting
 a
 ton
 of
 messages
 um
 on
 our


LinkedIn
 and
 emails
 and
 comments
 of


course
 people
 kept
 commenting
 and
 asking


for
 the
 next
 country
 and
 as
 soon
 as
 I


would
 release
 an
 episode
 there
 would
 be


a
 ton
 of
 comments
 being
 like
 hey
 can
 you


do
 Luxembourg?
 Can
 you
 do
 England?
 Can


you
 do
 France
 and
 that
 is
 how
 the
 where


to
 run
 series
 was
 born.
 It
 wasn't


supposed
 to
 be
 a
 series
 at
 the
 very


beginning.
 It
 just
 happened
 to
 be
 that


way.
 The
 only
 country
 that
 I
 was


planning
 on
 covering
 in
 the
 very


beginning
 was
 actually
 Canada
 because
 I


live
 here
 and
 I
 very
 much
 understand


what
 is
 happening
 on
 the
 local
 market.


But
 then
 people
 kept
 asking
 for
 more
 and


that's
 how
 the
 first
 series
 was
 born
 and


that
 is
 how
 the
 channel
 took
 off


initially.
 And
 I
 certainly
 believe
 that


that
 series
 was
 really
 our
 proof
 of


concept
 in
 product
 management
 terms,
 so


to
 say,
 because
 85%
 of
 the
 series
 was


filmed
 on
 iPhone
 13
 with
 the
 cheapest


lights
 with
 absolutely
 almost
 no


equipment.
 I
 was
 filming
 it
 right
 here


in
 my
 living
 room.
 In
 fact,
 the
 setup


that
 we
 have
 right
 now
 is
 actually


mimicking
 the
 setup
 that
 I
 had
 at
 the


very
 beginning.
 We
 wanted
 to
 have
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 uh
 nostalgia
 into
 how
 it


all
 started.
 So,
 uh,
 what
 I
 would
 like


to
 say
 to
 people
 who,
 um,
 perhaps
 start


their
 own
 channels
 or
 are
 thinking
 about


starting
 their
 own
 channels
 is
 that


before
 you
 invest,
 before
 you
 hire
 teams


or
 editors
 or
 any
 creative
 uh,
 resource


that
 will
 help
 you
 with
 your
 content,
 in


my
 opinion,
 it
 is
 really
 important
 that


you
 understand
 that
 your
 content
 can


take
 off
 even
 without
 an
 editor.
 I
 will


talk
 about
 the
 creative
 resources
 in
 a


bit,
 but
 you
 really
 have
 to
 make
 sure


that
 your
 content
 has
 value
 even
 when


there
 are
 no
 bells
 and
 whistles.
 And


also,
 I
 can
 speak
 for
 myself.
 I
 am


really
 not
 built
 for
 editing
 work.
 I


hate
 it
 with
 passion.
 I
 cannot
 stand


editing
 videos.
 But
 I
 am
 nevertheless


happy
 that
 I
 was
 doing
 that
 for
 5
 months


straight.
 But
 the
 fact
 that
 I
 did
 it
 by


myself,
 first
 of
 all,
 it
 gives
 you


understanding
 of
 what
 it
 is
 that
 you're


asking
 for
 when
 you're
 hiring
 a
 creative


resource.
 Secondly,
 it
 gives
 you


appreciation
 for
 that
 work
 because
 you


know
 how
 much
 time
 it
 takes
 so
 that
 when


an
 editor
 gets
 back
 to
 you
 and
 says


that,
 hey,
 you
 know,
 I
 can't
 do
 this
 or


that,
 you
 understand
 why
 they're
 saying


that.
 They're
 not
 just
 trying
 to
 be


difficult.
 So,
 my
 recommendation
 to
 all


people
 who
 are
 starting
 YouTube
 is
 get


your
 proof
 of
 concept
 first.
 Your


content
 has
 to
 land.
 There
 is
 so
 much


content
 and
 videos
 on
 YouTube
 with


basically
 no
 editing.
 Like
 it
 is


surprising
 how
 primitive
 they
 are
 and


that
 video
 would
 have
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 views
 because
 there
 is


something
 about
 that
 content
 that


resonates.
 I'm
 sharing
 this
 because
 a


lot
 of
 you
 have
 been
 asking
 us
 in
 the


comments
 what
 we
 do
 on
 the
 creative


side,
 how
 all
 of
 this
 background
 process


is
 happening.
 So
 I'm
 just
 telling
 you


that
 your
 content
 has
 to
 land
 first.


everything
 that
 comes
 on
 top.
 Editing


will
 enhance
 her
 content,
 but
 it's


basically
 like
 putting
 expensive,


beautiful
 cutlery
 on
 a
 dirty
 table.
 That


table
 has
 to
 be
 clean
 and
 no
 cutlery


will
 save
 it.
 So
 that
 is
 something
 that


I
 would
 recommend
 to
 keep
 in
 mind.


Moving
 on
 to
 chapter
 two.


So
 in
 May,
 something
 slightly
 unexpected


happened.
 I
 actually
 had
 my
 first
 video


editor
 and
 unfortunately
 she
 was
 a


little
 overwhelmed
 and
 wasn't
 able
 to


continue
 working
 with
 me.
 So
 my
 close


friend
 Maria
 um
 who
 I
 often
 mention
 on


this
 channel
 offered
 to
 help
 me
 out
 and


it
 was
 supposed
 to
 be
 just
 a
 temporary


four
 video
 partnership.
 We
 had
 four


videos
 that
 I
 needed
 to
 get
 done.
 I


asked
 her
 to
 help
 me
 out
 and
 then
 um
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 fourth
 video
 she
 offered


that
 we
 try
 and
 do
 this
 together.
 we
 or


at least
 I
 did
 not
 have
 any


expectations.
 I
 was
 just
 I
 promised


myself
 to
 give
 it
 a
 year.
 Back
 when
 I


started,
 I
 was
 like,
 I'm
 going
 to
 give


it
 a
 year
 no matter
 what
 happens.
 Even


if
 I
 get
 zero,
 even
 if
 nobody


subscribes,
 nobody
 says
 a
 word,
 nobody


comments.
 I'm
 doing
 it
 for
 a
 year
 and
 I


want
 to
 see
 what
 comes
 out
 in
 the
 end.


And
 5
 months
 into
 the
 channel,
 um
 we


started
 working
 on
 it
 together
 with


Maria.
 And
 when
 we
 partnered,
 we
 had
 the


whole
 summer
 ahead
 of
 us.
 But
 the


problem
 was
 that
 we
 knew
 that
 the
 series


that
 we
 were
 doing,
 the
 where
 to
 run


series,
 it
 was
 taking
 off,
 but
 we
 knew


that
 it
 would
 end
 at
 some
 point.
 And


that
 was
 something
 that
 we
 were
 really


scared
 of
 because
 when
 the
 channel


starts
 to
 take
 off,
 I
 mean,
 of
 course,


as
 you
 know,
 you're
 pour
 your
 heart
 and


soul
 into
 this
 thing
 and
 you're


expecting
 that
 it
 would
 continue,
 but
 we


knew
 that
 at
 some
 point
 it
 would
 stop


and
 we
 would
 need
 to
 do
 something


different.
 And
 the
 problem
 is
 I
 realized


that
 as
 much
 as
 I'm
 grateful
 for
 the


fact
 that
 it
 was
 the
 where
 to
 run
 series


that
 really
 brought
 us
 the
 takeoff
 that


we
 were
 looking
 for,
 it
 is
 not
 the


content
 that
 I
 wanted
 to
 make
 because
 it


was
 incredibly
 career
 oriented.
 And
 the


reason
 that
 we
 knew
 that
 it
 would
 end
 is


because
 all
 of
 it
 was
 based
 on
 my


experience,
 my
 and
 my
 research.
 And
 the


reason
 I
 covered
 only
 10
 countries
 in


this
 series
 is
 because
 I
 explored
 those


10
 countries
 for
 myself
 and
 that's
 why
 I


knew
 so
 much.
 But
 we
 knew
 that
 we
 would


have
 to
 pivot
 at
 some
 point.
 And
 the


second
 reason
 why
 I
 wanted
 to
 pivot
 is


because
 I
 did
 not
 want
 to
 be
 associated


with
 uh
 being
 a
 career
 creator.
 I
 wanted


to
 do
 a
 much
 more
 intellectual,


deep,
 and
 difficult
 content
 and
 tell
 you


the
 stories
 that
 on
 one
 hand
 are


incredibly
 dry
 and
 full
 of
 math,
 but


deliver
 them
 in
 a
 way
 that
 would
 really


make
 them
 sound
 as
 a
 fascinating
 story


to
 listen
 to.
 So
 yeah,
 we
 had
 a


difficult
 summer
 ahead
 of
 us
 because
 we


pivoted
 completely
 to
 business
 and
 tech


content
 which
 is
 a
 very
 difficult
 niche


on
 YouTube
 and
 it
 is
 something
 that
 is


dry
 by
 definition
 because
 you
 do
 talk


about
 a
 lot
 of
 math
 and
 you
 talk
 about
 a


lot
 of
 stats
 and
 making
 that
 kind
 of


content
 sound
 engaging
 through


storytelling.


You
 have
 to
 really
 be
 good
 good
 at


storytelling
 and
 making
 people


appreciate
 the
 numbers
 that
 you're


talking
 about.
 And
 our
 views
 dropped.
 It


was
 really
 difficult
 because
 when
 you're


creating
 it
 and
 you're
 putting
 just
 as


much
 effort,
 in
 fact,
 you're
 putting


more
 because
 now
 you
 have
 a
 creative


partner
 with
 you.
 She's
 putting
 a
 ton
 of


work.
 I
 am
 putting
 a
 ton
 of
 work
 in
 and


it's
 just
 not
 paying
 off.
 And
 looking


back,
 I
 completely
 understand
 why
 we
 had


such
 a
 difficult
 summer
 because
 we
 grew


an
 audience
 who
 came
 to
 us
 to
 learn


about
 tech
 employment,
 about
 careers,


about
 what's
 happening
 on
 the
 job


market.
 And
 we
 started
 feeding
 the


content
 that
 was
 really
 different
 from


what
 we
 did
 before.
 We
 started
 talking


about
 business,
 about
 tech,
 about
 AI
 in


the
 context
 of
 unit
 economics.
 It
 is
 a


very
 different
 content.
 It
 is
 different


in
 terms
 of
 depth.
 It
 is
 different
 in


terms
 of
 delivery.
 It
 is
 different
 on


every
 level.
 And
 that's
 not
 what
 the


audience
 that
 came
 to
 us
 in
 the
 spring,


that's
 not
 what
 they
 came
 here
 for.
 So


really
 in
 the
 summer,
 we
 had
 to
 almost


rebuild
 the
 entire
 channel.
 Now
 to
 your


questions,
 how
 much
 time
 do
 you
 spend
 on


your
 full-time
 job
 versus
 YouTube?
 And


how
 do
 you
 make
 time
 for
 the
 research


for
 YouTube
 videos?
 YouTube
 is
 my
 second


full-time
 job.
 I
 can
 say
 that
 with


certainty.
 I
 spend
 at
 least
 40
 hours
 a


week
 doing
 YouTube
 and
 that
 involves


content,
 reviewing
 stuff,
 talking
 about


the
 next
 videos,
 planning
 for
 the
 next


video.
 It's
 everything
 at
 once,
 but
 I


can
 say
 it
 with
 confidence.
 This
 is
 a


full-time
 job.
 And
 mind
 you,
 for
 me,


this
 is
 what
 I
 do
 after
 my
 day
 job.
 But


then
 for
 Maria,
 this
 is
 her
 full-time.


So
 yes,
 YouTube
 is
 a
 huge
 time


commitment.
 How
 much
 time
 does
 it
 take


to
 research
 on
 a
 topic
 and
 how
 do
 you


organize
 research?
 So,
 one
 video
 takes


me
 one
 full
 week
 to
 produce.
 For
 the


first
 three
 days,
 all
 I
 do
 is
 just
 read.


I
 read
 a
 lot
 of
 content
 and
 a
 lot
 of


data
 to
 be
 able
 to
 form
 an
 opinion
 and


deliver
 a
 video
 that
 I
 typically


deliver.
 I
 go
 through
 a
 hundred


resources
 probably
 per
 video.
 like
 I


read
 them
 from
 top
 to
 bottom
 and
 then


from
 everything
 that
 I
 read
 I
 filter
 out


what
 I
 actually
 want
 to
 use
 in
 my
 video


and
 the
 data
 that
 I
 want
 to
 pull
 into


it.
 So
 just
 reading
 and
 studying
 the


topic
 probably
 takes
 about
 25
 hours
 of


my
 time.
 Once
 the
 research
 is
 done,
 I


move
 on
 to
 assembling
 the
 data.
 So
 I


actually
 take
 data
 points
 that
 I
 have


found.
 I
 do
 the
 math
 myself
 when
 there


is
 no
 math
 that
 can
 be
 readily
 used.
 Day


five
 is
 my
 creative
 writing
 day.
 So
 when


I
 have
 done
 all
 the
 research,
 I
 have


found
 everything
 that
 I
 want
 to
 put
 in


the
 video,
 I
 have
 drawn
 all
 of
 the


conclusions
 and
 all
 of
 the
 second
 order


effects
 that
 I
 want
 to
 bring
 in
 my


video.
 That's
 when
 I
 start
 assembling
 a


script
 for
 my
 video.
 I
 do
 creative


writing.
 I
 tell
 the
 story
 that
 I'm


hoping
 is
 going
 to
 resonate
 with
 the


audience.
 And
 then
 I
 basically
 start


reading
 it
 to
 myself.
 So,
 I
 write
 it
 and


I
 read
 it
 to
 myself
 and
 I'm
 trying
 to


make
 it
 into
 a
 really
 like
 a
 mindblowing


story
 that
 would
 make
 anyone
 stick
 to


the
 screen
 and
 make
 the
 story
 really


irresistible
 to
 listen
 to.
 On
 day
 six,
 I


typically
 polish
 everything
 that
 I
 have


found,
 my
 research,
 my
 writing,
 and
 then


I
 start
 rehearsing.
 I
 start
 reading
 it


to
 myself.
 I
 read
 it
 and
 I
 rehearse
 it


and
 I'm
 trying
 to
 tell
 it
 in
 a
 way
 that


I
 would
 find
 interesting
 and
 that
 I


would
 be
 like
 really
 fascinating
 with


the
 story.
 and
 that
 is
 how
 I
 rehearse


and
 then
 on
 day
 seven
 we
 typically
 film.


What
 seems
 to
 be
 working
 for
 that


consistency,
 better
 selection
 of
 topics


or
 something
 else?
 Good
 question
 and


there
 is
 no
 right
 answer
 to
 this.
 It
 all


works
 when
 it's
 done
 in
 combination.
 So


consistency
 is
 important
 but
 it's
 about


20%
 of
 the
 entire
 equation.
 I
 do
 not


believe
 in
 the
 concept
 of
 as
 long
 as


you're
 doing
 it
 at
 some
 point
 the


algorithm
 will
 pick
 you
 up
 and
 you'll


just
 go
 with
 it.
 There
 are
 plenty
 of


channel
 a
 ton
 of
 channels
 with
 hundreds


of
 videos
 who
 have
 been
 on
 YouTube
 for


years
 and
 would
 have
 you
 know
 a
 thousand


subscribers
 at
 most
 and
 you
 go
 there
 and


person
 is
 doing
 fantastic
 job.
 They're


publishing
 videos
 or
 doing
 a
 ton
 of


stuff
 and
 the
 videos
 sometimes
 are
 very


good
 but
 they're
 just
 not
 they
 don't


have
 an
 audience.
 So
 consistency
 is


important
 for
 the
 algorithm.
 It
 is


important
 for
 the
 channel
 growth
 but


consistency
 is
 not
 everything.
 It
 is


part
 of
 the
 equation.
 Do
 not
 expect
 for


your
 channel
 or
 your
 personal
 brand
 or


anything
 that
 you're
 creating
 to
 take


off
 just
 because
 you
 have
 the
 volume.
 A


lot
 of
 people
 have
 the
 volume.
 The


volume
 is
 not
 the
 quality.
 I
 critique


every
 single
 video
 that
 we
 release


harder
 than
 anybody
 else.
 I
 go
 back
 to


my
 own
 scripts.
 I
 go
 back
 to
 listen
 to


myself.
 I
 go
 back
 to
 literally
 every


single
 element
 in
 that
 video
 and
 we
 try


to
 make
 it
 better.
 And
 that
 is
 what
 I


would
 say
 is
 probably
 the
 key
 to
 our


success.
 So
 back
 to
 your
 question,
 what


seems
 to
 be
 working?
 What's
 working
 is


when
 you
 approach
 every
 single
 element


of
 the
 production
 process
 with
 utmost


quality
 and
 you
 are
 really
 hard
 on


yourself.
 And
 I
 know
 this
 is
 probably
 an


unpopular
 opinion,
 but
 I
 think
 that


everybody
 should
 be
 hard
 on
 themselves.


You
 don't
 have
 to
 agree
 with
 me.
 Nobody


has
 to
 agree
 with
 me.
 This
 is
 just
 my


opinion.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 the
 only
 way


to
 get
 better
 is
 when
 you
 are
 extremely


critical
 of
 what
 you
 do.
 That
 is
 how
 we


treat
 our
 channel
 and
 that
 is
 the
 reason


why
 I
 think
 it
 succeeded.
 Your
 videos


always
 feel
 super
 current,
 like
 they're


pulled
 straight
 from
 what's
 happening


right
 now
 in
 AI
 and
 startups.
 How
 do
 you


decide
 what
 to
 make
 your
 next
 video


about?
 Very
 good
 question.
 Sometimes
 the


topics
 that
 I
 pick
 are
 evergreen.
 It's


just
 something
 that
 I
 have
 personally


been
 interested
 in
 for
 a
 long
 time.


There
 is
 also
 videos
 that
 are
 very


current
 as
 you
 said
 because
 there
 is


trending
 news
 and
 yes
 we
 do
 that
 as


well.
 We
 do
 typically
 split
 our
 content


into
 videos
 that
 are
 evergreen
 and
 very


trendy
 and
 current.
 So
 for
 example
 the


H1B
 video
 was
 definitely
 a
 response
 to


recent
 news.
 The
 circular
 economy
 video


was
 definitely
 a
 response
 to
 recent


news.
 But
 the
 unit
 economics
 of
 AI


startups
 that
 is
 an
 evergreen
 video.
 Do


you
 film
 videos
 after
 preparing
 a
 topic


or
 one
 by
 one
 or
 you
 make
 them
 in


batches
 to
 better
 organize
 your


production
 flow?
 No,
 we
 shoot
 them
 one


by
 one
 extremely
 rarely,
 maybe
 two
 at
 a


time.
 I
 think
 that
 it
 is
 best
 because
 I


simply
 get
 tired
 over
 time
 because


filming
 is
 difficult.
 You
 have
 to
 speak


on
 camera.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 presentable.


You
 have
 to
 be
 energetic.
 You
 have
 to


speak
 like
 it
 it's
 it's
 very
 tiring.
 So,


no,
 we
 do
 not
 film
 them
 in
 batches.
 It


would
 be
 really
 inefficient
 in
 my
 case.


What
 AI
 tools
 do
 you
 use
 in
 your


workflow
 for
 this
 channel
 for
 automation


and
 efficiency?
 Do
 you
 use
 any
 of
 these


tools
 for
 research
 or
 for
 script


writing?
 The
 only
 AI
 tool
 that
 I
 use


regularly
 and
 that
 I
 swear
 by
 is


Perplexity.
 And
 I
 use
 Perplexity


specifically
 to
 find
 sources.
 I
 cannot


think
 of
 a
 better
 tool
 other
 than


Perplexity
 that
 can
 gather
 as
 many


resources
 as
 possible
 on
 a
 given
 topic.


So
 when
 I
 start
 my
 research
 and
 when
 I


look
 for
 initial
 resources
 like
 those


three
 days
 when
 I'm
 telling
 you
 that
 I


do
 research
 for
 the
 first
 three
 day
 I


just
 read
 things
 that's
 where
 I
 start
 in


terms
 of
 other
 AI
 tools
 that
 we
 use
 in


our
 workflow.
 So,
 we
 absolutely
 love


Notion
 and
 Notion
 AI.
 We're
 very
 happy


that
 we
 partnered
 with
 them.
 This
 was
 a


huge
 moment
 for
 us
 this
 year.
 Even
 if
 we


didn't
 partner
 with
 them,
 we
 absolutely


love
 Notion
 and
 Notion
 AI.
 Fantastic


agent
 uh
 that
 they
 launched
 this
 year.


Um
 so,
 that
 is
 a
 huge
 part
 of
 the


workflow
 that
 we
 have.
 And
 also,
 Gamma


for
 all
 kinds
 of
 presentations
 uh
 that


we
 use
 for
 the
 team.
 We
 also
 heavily
 use


every
 single
 tool
 that
 we
 promote
 in
 our


channel
 because
 those
 are
 fantastic


products
 and
 they're
 really
 helpful.
 We


don't
 use
 them
 as
 much
 as
 we
 use


perplexity
 for
 example,
 but
 every
 single


tool
 that
 we
 have
 promoted
 on
 the


channel,
 we
 absolutely
 love
 and
 swear
 by


and
 we
 use
 it
 in
 our
 day-to-day.
 What


kind
 of
 skill
 set
 needed
 to
 survive
 an


AI
 boom
 coming
 next
 year?
 I
 guess


honestly,
 whatever
 it
 is
 that
 you
 do,
 I


say
 that
 there
 are
 four
 fundamental


skills
 that
 you
 need
 regardless
 of
 the


time
 that
 you
 live
 in.
 It's
 the
 ability


to
 write,
 the
 ability
 to
 speak,
 the


ability
 to
 read,
 and
 the
 ability
 to


research.
 the
 four
 skills
 that
 I
 swear


by
 and
 it
 doesn't
 matter
 whether
 you're


living
 through
 AI
 or
 AGI
 or
 ASI
 or


quantum
 or
 whatn
 not.
 If
 you're
 asking


about
 some
 tactical
 skills,
 it
 is


definitely
 the
 ability
 to
 work
 with


information.
 If
 you're
 asking
 about


education
 per
 se,
 the
 only
 thing
 I
 can


say
 is
 that
 again,
 I'm
 not
 claiming
 to


be
 right.
 This
 is
 just
 my
 opinion
 and


I'm
 sharing
 it
 because
 you're
 asking
 for


it.
 I
 am
 a
 huge
 proponent
 of
 formal


university
 education.
 High
 quality


university
 education
 is
 extremely


important
 for
 the
 vast
 majority
 of


people.
 And
 when
 someone
 says,
 well,


look
 at
 Bill
 Gates.
 Well,
 with
 all
 due


respect,
 not
 everybody
 is
 Bill
 Gates.


The
 vast
 majority
 of
 people
 are
 not
 him.


I
 am
 not
 him.
 I
 do
 think
 that


educational
 background
 in
 foundational


sciences,
 it
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 anything


fancy.
 doesn't
 have
 to
 be
 nanobiology
 or


any
 of
 the
 newer
 degrees.
 If
 you
 get


basic
 education
 in
 physics,
 in
 math,
 in


stats,
 in
 chemistry,
 that
 will
 be


sufficient
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 your
 life.


Whether
 it's
 AI
 or
 not,
 you
 will
 be


fine.
 So,
 I
 hope
 I
 answer
 your
 question.


If
 I
 didn't,
 let
 me
 know
 in
 the
 comments


and
 I'll
 be
 sure
 to
 continue
 there.


So,
 9
 months
 into
 the
 channel
 is
 when
 it


really
 took
 off.
 We
 had
 our
 first
 viral


video
 that
 got
 almost
 300,000
 views.


actually
 more
 than
 300,000
 now.
 And
 that


is
 when
 the
 actual
 takeoff
 happened.


Compared
 to
 the
 takeoff
 that
 we
 saw
 in


the
 spring,
 it
 was
 really
 unmatched.
 And


then
 4
 months
 into
 doing
 unit
 economics


and
 hardcore
 business
 content,
 that's


when
 we
 had
 our
 first
 uh
 viral
 video.


Now,
 back
 to
 your
 questions.
 Did
 you
 do


anything
 special
 to
 boost
 the
 channel
 or


traffic
 started
 to
 pick
 up
 with
 the


time?
 Nothing.
 We
 did
 absolutely
 nothing


to
 boost
 the
 traffic.
 There
 was
 zero


dollars
 invested.
 We're
 not
 doing


trends.
 We're
 not
 doing
 shorts.
 We're


not
 doing
 any
 other
 kind
 of
 social


media.
 YouTube
 is
 the
 only
 thing
 that
 we


do.
 And
 we
 did
 not
 invest
 a
 single


dollar
 into
 promotions.
 How
 long
 do
 you


plan
 this
 to
 be
 a
 side
 hustle?
 It
 seems


like
 the
 time
 point
 to
 go
 allin
 has


already
 come.
 Honest
 answer,
 until
 I
 can


comfortably
 build
 a
 business
 out
 of


this.
 If
 I
 weren't
 planning
 on
 scaling,


if
 I
 weren't
 planning
 on
 hiring
 any


team,
 if
 it
 was
 just
 the
 two
 of
 us,
 in


that
 case,
 I
 would
 be
 able
 to
 afford
 to


make
 this
 my
 primary
 income.
 But
 at
 the


same
 time,
 I
 would
 like
 to
 emphasize


that
 the
 reason
 I
 am
 able
 to
 produce


this
 level
 of
 content
 at
 this
 quality
 is


because
 of
 all
 the
 years
 that
 I
 have


spent
 in
 the
 tech
 industry.
 There
 is


absolutely
 no
 way
 I
 would
 be
 able
 to


make
 this
 level
 of
 research
 or
 this


level
 of
 content
 had
 I
 not
 spent
 the


previous
 10
 years
 working
 in
 the


industry.
 busting
 my
 ass
 and
 working


across
 a
 variety
 of
 industries
 and
 a


variety
 of
 companies.
 So,
 this
 is
 not
 to


say
 that
 don't
 do
 full-time
 or
 don't


ever
 go
 into
 employment
 become
 content


creators.
 The
 reason
 I'm
 a
 content


creator
 is
 because
 I
 spent
 a
 decade
 in


the
 industry.
 If
 you
 were
 to
 take
 a


second
 job
 instead
 of
 YouTube,
 would
 you


have
 made
 more
 or
 less
 money
 that
 you


make
 on
 YouTube?
 I'm
 guessing
 the
 answer


is
 obvious
 in
 the
 early
 stages
 of
 your


channel,
 but
 at
 which
 point
 will
 YouTube


revenue
 exceed
 equivalent
 time
 and


secondary
 job?
 A
 few
 things.
 You're


absolutely
 right
 and
 it
 does
 depend
 on


the
 stage
 of
 the
 channel,
 but
 it
 also


depends
 on
 your
 long-term
 goals.
 I
 did


not
 start
 YouTube
 to
 make
 a
 side
 income.


I
 started
 it
 to
 build
 my
 own
 voice
 and


to
 build
 my
 own
 content
 online
 and
 to
 be


known
 for
 my
 content.
 YouTube
 became
 a


massive
 confidence
 boost
 for
 me
 because


I
 always
 thought
 that
 I
 was
 never


enough.
 I
 thought
 that
 my
 skill
 set
 was


not
 enough.
 I
 thought
 that
 there
 was


always
 something
 not
 enough
 about
 me.
 So


the
 fact
 that
 when
 I
 started
 producing


content,
 I
 have
 a
 CEO,
 CTO,
 CPO


messaging
 me
 on
 LinkedIn
 every
 single


time
 I
 release
 a
 video
 asking
 for


consulting
 or
 offering
 me
 a
 job


definitely
 gave
 me
 the
 confidence
 that
 I


was
 lacking.
 So
 to
 your
 question,
 the


reason
 I
 was
 able
 to
 continue
 with


YouTube
 is
 because
 the
 financial
 aspect


of
 it
 was
 not
 my
 only
 or
 the
 primary


goal
 that
 I
 had
 when
 I
 started.
 Because


if
 it
 was
 just
 that,
 I
 would
 have
 given


up
 a
 lot
 sooner
 because
 YouTube
 is
 a


long-term
 game.
 And
 for
 me,
 yes,
 it
 just


so
 happened
 that
 it
 paid
 off
 because
 we


were
 able
 to
 hit
 55,000
 subscribers
 in


under
 one
 year.
 This
 is
 an
 extreme


outlier.
 What
 we
 have
 achieved
 is
 not


typical
 growth
 by
 any
 means,
 especially


for
 a
 dry
 business
 and
 tech
 channel.
 If


I
 was
 doing
 it
 just
 for
 the
 money,
 it


wouldn't
 have
 solved
 the
 problem
 of


having
 a
 steady
 side
 income
 because
 of


all
 the
 money
 that
 I
 make,
 I
 reinvest


95%
 of
 it
 back
 into
 the
 channel.
 So,


it's
 a
 lot
 of
 investment
 upfront
 hoping


that
 one
 day
 it'll
 pay
 off
 or
 that
 one


day
 it'll
 take
 off.
 So,
 if
 your
 goal
 is


purely
 financial
 and
 you
 just
 want
 to


make
 side
 income,
 I
 would
 say
 that
 it
 is


a
 lot
 less
 riskier
 to
 take
 a
 second
 job


rather
 than
 to
 do
 YouTube.
 Because
 with


YouTube
 again,
 you
 don't
 know
 if
 it's


going
 to
 take
 off
 and
 when
 it's
 going
 to


take
 off
 and
 how
 much
 you're
 going
 to


invest
 before
 it
 happens.
 I'm
 curious


whether
 your
 team
 is
 turning
 into
 a


social
 proof
 or
 a
 consulting
 crew.


Everything
 you've
 talked
 about
 feels


like
 stories
 from
 the
 consulting
 front


lines.
 Yes,
 I
 think
 it's
 definitely


going
 that
 way
 and
 we're
 actually


thinking
 to
 do
 a
 series
 in
 the
 new
 year


called
 the
 founder
 series.
 We're
 going


to
 be
 releasing
 a
 series
 of
 videos


specifically
 for
 entrepreneurs
 and


founders.
 And
 that
 is
 because
 I
 have


started
 my
 career
 and
 I
 have
 spent
 a
 lot


of
 time
 working
 for
 tiny
 startups
 going


through
 aggressive
 growth.
 I
 have
 seen


all
 variations
 and
 all
 kinds
 of
 angles


of
 small
 tech
 startups
 and
 how
 they


become
 big.
 So
 yes,
 consulting
 through


content
 is
 definitely
 something
 that


we're
 going
 to
 be
 pursuing
 next
 year.
 So


what's
 next
 for
 us?
 We
 are
 going
 to
 be


scaling.
 We're
 going to
 be
 scaling
 both


our
 content
 and
 the
 team.
 We
 will


continue
 creating
 fascinating
 stories


about
 tech
 and
 business
 in
 the
 post


layoff,
 post-pandemic
 AI
 first
 economy.


We
 will
 continue
 telling
 fantastic


stories
 about
 math,
 about
 business,
 and


about
 tech.
 One
 of
 the
 core
 principles


for
 our
 entire
 team
 is
 to
 stay
 extremely


centric
 and
 neutral.
 We're
 not


left-leaning,
 we're
 not
 right
 leaning.


We
 are
 as
 objective
 and
 as
 deeply
 data


verified
 as
 we
 can
 possibly
 be.


So,
 what
 can
 you
 expect
 in
 the
 new
 year?


We
 will
 be
 expanding
 our
 content


verticals.
 You
 know,
 I
 talk
 about
 a
 lot


of
 things.
 I
 talk
 about
 business.
 I
 talk


about
 tech
 and
 geopolitics.
 I
 talk
 about


finance.
 I
 talk
 about
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 are
 around
 the
 topic
 of
 technology


and
 business.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 be


expanding
 our
 content
 lines
 and
 every


single
 one
 of
 those
 things.
 So,
 to
 give


you
 a
 little
 glimpse,
 there's
 going
 to


be
 new
 hosts.
 There's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot


more
 creativity.
 There's
 going
 to
 be
 a


lot
 more
 variety
 in
 our
 content.
 And
 the


series
 that
 I
 promise
 you
 is
 the
 founder


series
 that
 I
 feel
 incredibly
 excited


about.
 Coming
 back
 to
 your
 last


questions,
 do
 you
 have
 any
 plans
 for
 a


Discord
 type
 community
 for
 this
 channel


where
 we
 can
 discuss
 points
 you
 bring
 up


in
 your
 videos?
 So,
 I
 have
 been
 asked


multiple
 times
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a


community.
 And
 I
 thought
 actually
 about


doing
 it
 on
 Slack,
 but
 if
 I'm
 being


honest,
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 have
 mental
 and


physical
 capacity
 to
 manage
 those


channels
 right
 now
 just
 because
 I
 have
 a


full-time
 job
 and
 YouTube
 is
 my
 second


full-time
 job
 in
 and
 of
 itself.
 And


we're
 going to
 be
 scaling
 the
 team.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 I
 have
 enough
 time
 to


manage
 a
 Slack
 or
 a
 Discord
 community,


but
 what
 I
 am
 thinging
 to
 do
 is
 a


YouTube
 community.
 YouTube
 has
 a


community
 feature.
 I'm
 going
 to
 explore


it
 over
 the
 next
 several
 weeks
 while
 we


have
 a
 little
 break.
 And
 I
 promise
 that


I
 will
 bring
 a
 community
 element
 into


the
 channel
 next
 year.
 Not
 sure
 it's


going
 to
 be
 Discord
 or
 Slack,
 at least


at
 the
 beginning,
 but
 I
 promise


something
 is
 definitely
 coming.
 Please


come
 up
 with
 a
 course.
 I
 like
 your
 no
 BS


PM
 content.
 I
 am
 not
 interested
 in
 PM


courses.
 So,
 if
 you're
 looking
 for
 a


NOBS
 PM
 course
 that
 I
 would
 highly


recommend,
 it's
 definitely
 going
 to
 be


Reforged.
 This
 is
 not
 sponsored
 by
 any


means,
 but
 if
 there
 is
 one
 product


management
 resource
 that
 I
 would
 swear


by
 and
 I
 love
 every
 single
 course
 that


they
 post,
 it's
 Reforge.
 And
 your
 last


question,
 do
 you
 do
 it
 yourself
 or
 do


you
 have
 someone
 help
 me
 with
 the


content?
 No,
 I
 don't
 do
 it
 myself.
 This


is
 Maria.
 You've
 heard
 about
 her
 a


million
 times,
 so
 say
 hi.


>> Hello
 everyone.
 I'm
 Maria.
 I'm
 Daria's


creative
 partner
 and
 I
 am
 editing
 most


of
 her
 videos.
 We
 also
 now
 have
 a
 new


team
 member.
 Her
 name
 is
 Lauren.
 So,


there's
 a
 really
 high
 chance
 this
 video


that
 you're
 seeing
 right
 now
 is
 edited


by
 her.
 So,
 say
 hi
 to
 lovely
 Lauren.
 So,


this
 is
 my
 friend.
 This
 is
 my
 creative


partner.
 This
 is
 the
 second
 person
 that


you
 don't
 see
 on
 camera
 who
 is
 always


behind
 the
 camera.
 So,
 this
 is
 her.
 Um,


now
 you
 know
 what
 she
 looks
 like.
 from


both
 of
 us.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


watching
 us
 this
 year.
 This
 was
 a
 very


important
 and
 a
 very
 difficult
 and
 a


very
 exciting
 time
 for
 us.
 We're
 doing


this
 for
 the
 first
 time
 and
 we
 highly


appreciate
 everyone
 who
 believed
 in
 us,


who
 commented
 on
 our
 videos,
 who
 said


something
 nice.
 Huge
 thanks.
 We
 have
 big


ambitions.
 We
 have
 big
 plans
 and
 we're


hoping
 that
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 even


bigger
 next
 year.
 So
 from
 both
 of
 us,


merry
 Christmas
 everyone.
 Merry


Christmas,
 happy
 Hanukkah,
 whatever
 it


is
 that
 you're
 celebrating.
 Happy


holidays,
 happy
 new
 year.
 And
 again,


thank
 you
 for
 staying
 with
 us.
 Thank
 you


for
 watching
 us.
 We
 will
 see
 you
 next


year.
 And
 for
 the
 last
 time
 in
 2025,


bye


>> bye.
