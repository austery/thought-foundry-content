Salvatore Cusumano is the
executive director of
Transparency International
Canada, and he joins us in
studio. How are you doing?
>> Great. Thank you for having
me.
>> Great to have you here.
Let's start off with we're here
to talk corruption. So I think
it's fair that we start the
conversation with corruption
scandal that's taken the
headlines here in Toronto and
broader. But what's your take
on the Toronto police
corruption scandal right now?
>> I mean, I think it shows us
it's a really elegant, if
unfortunate illustration of how
corruption works in Canada. Of
course, the allegations haven't
been proven yet. And anything I
say today, of course, is really
respectful of the due process
that exists and the
investigations that are
continuing. But I think it
shows you that with corruption,
it takes two to tango. What I
mean by that is that on the one
hand, when we talk about
corruption, you do have public
officials who have to be
willing to engage in the
behaviour, people who are going
to use their position of power
or authority to personal,
private or potentially criminal
benefit. On the other hand, you
have just that, which is an
actor or a party that motivates
the corruption in some cases,
maybe coerces the corruption.
And, you know, in this case, we
see, unfortunately, allegations
of public officials serving the
public who may have been tied
up in behaviour by actors who
were looking to exploit a
public institution for some
very nefarious purposes.
>> You use the word elegant.
Help explain that?
>> Well, I think it's elegant
because, you know, at
Transparency International,
we're the Canadian chapter of a
of a global organization. And
what's elegant is that it's a
really, really clear
illustration. If it's proven of
the vulnerabilities that our
institutions face in Canada. On
the one hand, you know, I think
the investigations hopefully
will point to some of the sort
of systemic tendencies that we
could improve in our
institutions. But on the other
hand, it does show a rising
concern with organized crime in
Canada and the way that
organized crime can, can really
impact the integrity of our
institutions. And so it's
elegant in that sense because
it's come out in public. We're
fortunate to see it. And we do
applaud the investigators who
brought it to light. There's
elegance in that too, that
we see the impact of the
resources we put into these
types of investigations. But
unfortunately, the downsides
are evident as well.
>> How corruption in policing
is that, is that rare in Canada?
These are the institutions that
would sort of be investigating
corruption cases on their own.
So we flip that case is it
rare to see.
>> That's a good question. And
I think that, you know, on the
one hand, I hope that the
investigations that are going
on will tell us, hopefully,
that this is an isolated
incident in the Toronto police
and in Toronto police, Toronto
Area police services. But no,
we've seen cases of
corruption in police
services in Canada. We've also
seen issues of other types
of misconduct that exist.
Sometimes the two are linked.
But I think the real takeaway
here is that I think there's a
sense sometimes in Canada that
that corruption or the word
corruption refers to something
that happens elsewhere, that it
refers to something that
happens in countries that are
not democratic. I think I think
what we see here is a real
reminder that it is these types
of public institutions that in
this case, are supposed to be
identifying, prosecuting this
type of behaviour. Criminal
organizations are targeting
those, those, those entities as
well, because they need to
carry out the types of
activities they're doing. These
are vulnerable institutions.
And if we let our foot off the
gas, as these groups become
more sophisticated, this type
of behaviour could become more
common as well. But it does
exist in Canada. It has existed,
and we hope in this case it's
isolated. But we'll have to see
what comes out.
>> All right. Well, let's
switch gears a bit and I want
to zoom out and talk about the
Transparency International's
2025 Corruption Perception
Index for people who aren't
familiar with it. What is it?
What's the methodology?
>> That's a great question. So
the Corruption Perceptions
Index is sort of it's probably
the most discussed index on
corruption in the world right
now. Transparency international
has been doing it for, for
about 20 years. And what it
basically shows is the
perceptions of experts and
business leaders vis a vis the
perceived levels of corruption
that exist in a country. Now,
when I say perceived, it's not
a direct measure of how many
police scandals took place in
the country. It's it's more a
measure of what is the
confidence and what is the
degree of certainty that people
have about what kind of place
is Canada to do business? What
kind of place is Canada to be a
citizen and to expect
accountability from its
institutions? Now, what we saw
on the rankings this year, 182
countries were ranked. Canada
was 16th from the top. So you
could say 16th best. I think if
we're looking to Milano Cortina
right now, we're not going to
settle for 16th.
>> In hockey.
>> Fair enough. But you know, I
think it shows again, this it's
sort of what you see in the
police scandal is that when I
say 16th, that's a downward
trend, the lowest ranking ever
for Canada since we started the
index. And since we were able
to kind of standardize the
scores in 2012, it could still
be a good score in a global
context. You know, top 10%. But
it's that trend we're worried
about because we think it also
reflects and tracks with
declining public trust in our
institutions and a perception
that things aren't working
in some way when it comes to
prosecuting these types of
crimes. And as an aside, you
know, the fact that business
leaders are involved in the
types of indices that feed into
our index, it should be a cause
for concern at a time when
Canada is trying to diversify
its trade and investment
partnerships. You know, if our
country, if our financial
systems are not deemed to be
secure, clean, it does increase
costs for investors in terms of
due diligence, in terms of
checking where their money is
going. And, you know, we really
think on all aspects public
trust and investor trust.
Frankly, we need to do a much
better job and turn the ship
around.
>> I don't want to make the
same analogy of the Olympics
here, but, you know, it's hard
not to compete or compare
ourselves when we're looking at
this. How do we compare to
other Democratic peers?
>> So one of the interesting
things that came out this year
is we saw a sustained trend of
a similar decline among what
you might call Canada's peer
democracies, countries in the
G7, some of its NATO partners,
and so on. Now, again, on the
one hand, you might be tempted
to say, oh, well, what's
happening here is not that
exceptional. I think when you
think back to, for example,
what our Prime Minister talked
about at the World Economic
Forum, you know, you do see, in
a sense, a threat that exists
across many countries, a
similar trend of declining
public trust that we hope
doesn't signal something deeper
about how democracy in general
is performing. We we believe
that Canada can be a leader in
in this community of countries.
Our prime minister has
certainly said he hopes that we
can be he intends for us to be.
And I think this is one area
where democracies really have
to come together and identify
what is it about our
institutions that is not
keeping the public trust, and
how can we change that?
>> When we look at sort of from
that zoomed out perspective
from the global side, you
talked about perception versus
actual corruption. Can you give
us some examples in terms
of what a perception would look
like versus actual? When we
look at maybe down that index,
when we get down to the bottom
half of these countries.
>> Sure. Maybe one thing I can
talk about is the financial
sector in a country. Another
thing I could talk about is the
type of corporate ownership
transparency that exists. And
these two things can go
hand in hand sometimes. For
example, one of the things that
that we can really see in the
index coming through is what
kind of confidence exists in
who are people doing business
with, and where does money come
from when it's flowing into
Canada, through Canada and out
of Canada? Now the Corruption
Perceptions Index is about
public sector institutions.
That's important to mention.
But these kind of broader
questions around how, how
well is it known, what
companies are doing business
with the Canadian government or
with the Ontario government,
for example? We are fortunate
at Transparency International
to have been able to work with
government at various levels to
have a registry now of
companies that are registered
at federal level and in a
couple of provinces, who's
behind them, what data exists?
We think that still there could
be room to roll this out across
all provinces, an issue that
you'll see come into public
sector corruption in Canada is
that it is a complicated
environment. You've got
regulations at federal level,
provincial level, even at some,
in some cases municipal level
with these things. And because
Canada's complex people need an
additional level of certainty
sometimes to be able to, to, to
have, have trust. And we
certainly see that in Canada
from a citizens perspective as
well.
>> With that, what steps has
Canada taken to shore up
confidence that our system has
safeguards against corruption?
Obviously there's work to be
done, but what have we done so
far?
>> Sure we have. We have the
fortunate opportunity right now,
a global body that looks at the
integrity of our anti-money
laundering framework in Canada,
the Financial Action Task Force,
they're actually wrapping up a
review right now that's going
to look at how far has Canada
come over the last five and ten
years in, in strengthening a
framework that there had been
some deficiencies identified.
Now Canada has done a couple of
things that we think could be
stronger in practice. One is
opening up that corporate black
box numbered companies at the
federal level. Now they're
they're available for viewing
on a public registry, B.C. and
Quebec as well. Ontario has
announced they're going to do
it as well. You know, this is a
really good opportunity to
show a body like this, but also
our citizens that you can't
hide behind a numbered company.
You've got to you've got to do
business openly. So we could
see that we hope that will
spread out across Canada. But
it's a good step. Another one
is we just saw Canada announce
the government announced in the
budget 2025 budget, the
creation of a new financial
crimes agency, which might look
into that sort of supply side.
I talked about where you have
organizations trying to corrupt
our institutions. This agency
should theoretically help
improve the coordination
between bodies like RCMP,
provincial level police,
Fintrac,
the financial intelligence unit.
That's a good step. It's been
named in the budget, but we
would want to know what kind of
resources are behind it. How is
it going to harmonise those
those entities rather than add
another one to the mix? Those
are two things that they have
great potential, but it's kind
of the story. In Canada. We see
good announcements. We have to
really make them effective now.
>> All right. Prime Minister
Carney's government passed the
Building Canada Act to expedite
infrastructure projects deemed
in the nation's interest. When
we see expedite, we think
things are going to speed up
there. There might be some
things that are missing there.
Are there any risks that this
would create opportunity for
corruption?
>> Certainly. I think that we
at Transparency International
Canada know through our
international network that when
you speed up the way you do
business, the way you make
investments, the way you spend
public money, if at the same
time you're not increasing
transparency and increasing
oversight at a similar rate,
public money is going to be
misspent. We could look at what
happened during Covid, for
example. I think that everybody
knows some of the public
misspending that took place,
the name Arrivecan, while it
should have been a source of
pride for something that
secured our country and
improved our public health,
it's now become an infamous
name in terms of how our money
is, is, is spent that
incident could be multiplied
many, many times over. If we
don't manage this critical
moment the right way. And so
when we see the creation of
things like, for example, a new
Defence investment agency, you
know, that can be a very good
way of helping improve our
country's defence. But we need
to make sure that when you
do create these kind of
channels, that there is an
opportunity to, to be open
with the public as much as you
can with something as sensitive
as defence about where the
money is being spent, that it's
being spent competitively, and
that it is actually, at the end
of the day, improving our
defence. Because that's the
bottom line. If we spend money
and it doesn't improve our
defence, that will undermine
public trust. Same goes with
infrastructure and many other
priorities.
>> Very quickly. When we're
talking about Canada, it's hard
not to have a conversation
about the US as well. To some,
the US has been the world's
policeman to some extent. How
have they been doing at
policing corruption under this
administration?
>> Well, they've announced the
rollback of certain of the
enforcement of certain laws
that were instrumental in
bringing people to justice,
both in the US and abroad. Now,
I think what we'll see, it's
still early to tell, if you can
imagine a year in, we have seen
so much. But on this front, I
think it's still early to tell
where it will go. It's again a
reminder that these things can
be weaponized. It's a reminder
that you don't want to make
yourself a target. We need to
be impeccable on all of these
things. It's not just the
potential of rolling back
enforcement, it's the potential
of using it in ways that suit
pretexts. We have seen this
administration use, you know,
the justification of, of
Fentanyl flowing across the
border into the US as a reason
to apply tariffs. It's just a
call to say whatever is
happening south of us, there
are so many things we can do to
get better. Let's not give
anyone a reason to point the
finger.
>> All right. We're going to
leave it there. I really
appreciate your insights. Thank
you so much.
>> Appreciate your time. Thank
you so much.
