Welcome
 to
 part
 three
 of
 our
 2026
 big


idea
 series.
 Oliver
 Shu
 explores
 how


autonomous
 labs
 and
 AI
 are


revolutionizing
 scientific
 discovery
 and


changing
 how
 we
 conduct
 research
 and


accelerate
 breakthroughs.
 Brian
 Kim


reveals
 how
 AI
 is
 evolving
 beyond
 mere


productivity
 tools
 to
 become
 the


connective
 tissue
 and
 consumer


applications,
 transforming
 how
 we


interact
 and
 engage.
 And
 David
 Haber


discusses
 how
 AI
 is
 reinforcing
 business


models,
 creating
 compounding
 advantages


that
 separate
 leaders
 from
 followers.


My
 name
 is
 Oliver
 Shu.
 I'm
 a
 partner
 on


the
 American
 Dynism
 team
 here
 at
 A16Z.


And
 my
 big
 idea
 is
 that
 advances
 in
 AI


reasoning
 capabilities
 and
 in
 robot


learning
 will
 help
 accelerate
 scientific


progress
 by
 moving
 us
 closer
 towards


autonomous
 labs.
 Laboratory
 automation


is
 something
 that's
 existed
 for
 a
 long


time.
 Like
 that
 is
 not
 new.
 This
 idea
 of


having
 robots
 that
 you
 can
 pre-program


to
 assist
 in
 some
 of
 the
 motions


involved
 in
 a
 lab.
 What
 is
 new
 and
 what


is
 emerging
 right
 now
 is
 the
 combination


of
 reasoning
 capabilities


um
 and
 experiment
 planning
 and
 uh
 the


physical
 element
 of
 lab
 automation.
 So


what
 that
 might
 look
 like
 in
 the
 near


term
 is
 collaboration
 between
 a


scientist
 and
 a
 system
 that
 involves


both
 an
 AI
 application
 and
 a
 robot.
 Um


and
 having
 that
 be
 a
 much
 more


collaborative
 process
 uh
 in
 the
 near


term
 in
 many
 different
 kinds
 of
 labs
 and


many
 different
 kinds
 of
 scientific


processes
 whether
 that's
 in
 the
 life


sciences
 in
 the
 chemicals
 industry
 in


the
 material
 science
 uh
 research
 sphere


uh
 and
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.
 One
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 think
 is
 important
 in
 the


near
 term
 though
 is
 around


interpretability.
 So,
 you
 know,
 if
 you


think
 about
 AI
 systems
 as


non-deterministic
 computers,
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 really
 matters
 for
 research


is
 you
 want
 to
 really
 understand
 why
 the


system
 is
 doing
 what
 it's
 doing,
 why


it's
 planning
 on
 uh
 iterating
 on
 an


experiment
 in
 a
 given
 way,
 why
 it's


planning
 on
 doing
 this
 particular
 thing.


And
 I
 think
 uh
 you
 know
 systems
 that
 are


purpose-built
 for
 scientific
 research


are
 probably
 going
 to
 focus
 a
 lot
 on


that
 on
 the
 interpretability
 on


recording
 what
 exactly
 is
 is
 uh
 is


happening
 throughout
 each
 step
 of
 the


process
 as
 it
 collaborates
 with
 a
 human


scientist.
 I
 think
 this
 concept
 of
 fully


self-driving
 science,
 right,
 like
 a
 a


closed
 loop
 where
 you
 have
 AI
 that


iterates
 on
 itself
 and
 then
 carries
 out


an
 experiment,
 then
 continues
 to
 to
 to


iterate
 without
 human
 intervention.
 I


think
 this
 is
 further
 out.
 This
 is
 what


I
 would
 consider
 the
 destination
 uh
 for


this
 idea
 of
 of
 autonomous
 science.


I
 think
 where
 we
 are
 right
 now
 is
 that


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 being
 done
 uh
 to


form
 the
 foundations
 of
 autonomous


science
 and
 there
 uh
 if
 you
 consider


science
 as
 you
 know
 broadly
 speaking


some
 combination
 of
 theory
 of


computation
 and
 of
 experimentation


there's
 work
 being
 done
 in
 the
 AI


ecosystem
 across
 areas
 like
 mathematical


reasoning
 uh
 physical
 reasoning


simulation
 and
 world
 models
 and
 robot


learning
 and
 all
 of
 these
 things


eventually
 as
 these
 capabilities
 improve


can
 be
 applied
 to
 uh
 closing
 this
 loop.


But
 progress
 across
 all
 these
 fields
 is


of
 course
 uneven
 and
 you
 kind
 of
 have
 to


wait
 for
 the
 capabilities
 to
 get
 to
 the


point
 where
 um
 they're
 ready
 to
 be


applied
 to
 this
 close
 this
 closed
 loop


and
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 destination
 and


in
 the
 near
 term
 incrementally
 we'll


make
 progress
 on
 you
 know
 lab
 automation


on
 the
 reasoning
 pieces
 of
 this
 um
 but


uh
 ultimately
 the
 final
 destination
 I


think
 would
 be
 around
 this
 idea
 of
 a
 of


of
 a
 self-driving
 lab
 or
 of
 autonomous


science
 part
 of
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be


driven
 by
 the
 market
 dynamic


uh
 in
 which
 the
 research
 is
 conducted.


So
 I
 think
 there
 are
 certain
 categories


of
 science
 where
 there
 is
 just
 a
 much


more
 mature


uh
 demand
 side
 market
 for
 the
 outputs
 of


research
 and
 examples
 include
 of
 course


life
 sciences
 and
 pharma
 um
 the


chemicals
 industry
 um
 facets
 of
 the
 uh


material
 science
 industry.
 I
 think
 these


are
 areas
 where
 there
 is
 a
 ready


uh
 and
 willing
 buyer
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 the


outputs
 of
 this
 research
 and
 the


uh
 this
 the
 increase
 in
 speed
 and


capability
 uh
 as
 well
 as
 any
 cost


advantage
 that
 might
 um
 that
 might


occur.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 are
 going
 to


matter
 more
 to
 uh
 for
 markets
 where


there
 is
 a
 well-established
 buyer
 of
 of


of
 research
 output.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 the


where
 you
 see
 autonomous
 labs
 and


autonomous
 science
 being
 adopted
 first


is
 probably
 more
 of
 a
 function
 of
 the


market
 that
 um
 that
 that
 that
 it's


operating
 in.
 I
 think
 periodic
 labs
 is
 a


great
 example
 of
 uh
 of
 a
 team
 taking
 a


swing
 um
 at
 uh
 at
 autonomous
 science.
 I


think
 you
 know
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


early
 stage
 startup
 landscape
 there's


companies
 like
 Medra
 that
 are
 focused
 on


the
 life
 sciences
 and
 uh
 pharma
 market.


There's
 companies
 like
 uh
 Chemifi
 and


Yona
 Labs
 that
 are
 focused
 on
 the
 uh
 on


on
 the
 chemistry
 industry.
 Um
 and
 then


there's
 zooming
 out
 a
 bit
 there's


collaborations
 between
 government
 and


industry
 that
 are
 really
 focused
 on
 this


intersection
 of
 AI
 and
 science.
 uh
 you


know
 there
 is
 the
 genesis
 mission
 led
 by


the
 department
 of
 energy
 uh
 that
 brings


together
 you
 know
 academia,
 government


and
 the
 national
 labs
 as
 well
 as
 uh


leading
 AI
 companies
 uh
 to
 pursue


AIdriven
 science.
 I
 think
 just
 today


DeepMind
 announced
 a
 partnership
 with


the
 UK
 government
 um
 to
 collaborate
 on


areas
 of
 scientific
 discovery.
 So
 I


think
 there's,
 you
 know,
 there's


startups
 that
 are
 working
 on
 lab


automation.
 There's
 startups
 that
 are


working
 on
 building
 an
 AI
 scientist
 and


that
 work
 is
 happening
 against
 the


backdrop
 of
 a
 broader
 collaboration


between
 both
 the
 public
 sector
 and
 the


private
 sector
 in
 academia
 to
 really


accelerate
 AIdriven
 scientific


discovery.


>> Hi,
 I'm
 Brian
 Kim.
 I'm
 a
 partner
 at


A16Z's
 AI
 applications
 investing
 team.


2026
 marks
 the
 year
 where
 major
 consumer


AI
 application
 products
 shift
 from


productivity,
 helping
 you
 work
 to


connectivity,
 helping
 you
 stay


connected.
 Instead
 of
 helping
 you
 just


do
 work,
 AI
 allows
 you
 to
 see
 yourself


clearly
 and
 help
 build
 relationship
 with


people
 you
 love.
 AI
 has
 been
 incredibly


useful
 for
 productivity.
 And
 I
 think


we'll
 we'll
 start
 seeing
 AI
 actually


take
 more
 mind
 share
 and
 time
 from


traditional
 products
 versus
 AI


productivity
 tools.
 There
 will
 be
 folks


who
 use
 it
 to
 really
 augment
 and


actually
 get
 that
 connection
 that
 they


feel
 that
 they
 need
 from
 others


digitally.
 I
 think
 there
 will
 be
 a
 group


of
 people
 who
 really
 use
 AI
 to


facilitate
 their
 existing
 relationships


in
 person.
 We're
 all
 social
 animals
 and


I
 believe
 AI
 has
 a
 real
 place
 in
 helping


us
 stay
 connected
 with
 others
 and
 help


us
 feel
 like
 we're
 seen
 by
 others.
 Can


startups
 compete
 with
 the
 large


incumbent
 platforms?
 The
 incumbents
 have


the
 platform,
 they
 have
 the
 network.
 AI


brings
 a
 net
 new
 user
 interaction
 that


may
 be
 difficult
 to
 replicate
 and
 may


not
 natively
 live
 in
 the
 platforms
 of


the
 product.
 And
 in
 so
 far
 as
 there
 are


net
 new
 user
 interaction
 models,
 in
 so


far
 as
 there's
 net
 new
 creative
 outlets


and
 atomic
 units
 that
 look
 different


from
 what's
 available
 in
 current


platforms,
 my
 strong
 belief
 is
 that


startups
 can
 absolutely
 win.


Increasingly,
 we're
 sharing
 so
 much
 more


of
 our
 inner
 life
 with
 AI.
 What
 I
 get


really
 excited
 about
 is
 people's


willingness
 to
 share
 is
 deepening
 with


AI.
 What
 happens
 when
 I'm
 okay
 with
 my


AI
 coming
 to
 your
 AI,
 my
 guy
 talking
 to


your
 guy
 and
 say,
 "Look,
 have
 you


checked
 in
 on
 him?
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 talk


about
 ABC?"
 I
 think
 those
 would
 be
 an


opener
 for
 net
 new
 relationship,
 net
 new


conversations
 that
 we
 wouldn't
 have


otherwise.
 And
 I'm
 very
 excited
 for
 AI


to
 actually
 finally
 help
 people
 be
 seen


by
 others.
 The
 mantra
 in
 consumer


products
 is
 look
 always
 try
 to
 actually


address
 the
 core
 emotion.
 The
 core


emotion
 again
 here
 is
 wanting
 to
 be


seen,
 wanting
 to
 feel
 connected
 to


others.
 And
 in
 order
 for
 the
 first
 step


to
 happen,
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 helpful
 for


the
 AI
 product
 to
 be
 able
 to
 understand


who
 you
 are.
 So
 then
 the
 question
 is


what
 would
 be
 the
 best
 mechanism
 for
 a


product
 to
 understand
 you
 quickly


without
 you
 narrating
 your
 life
 story.


Perhaps
 it's
 ingestion
 of
 your
 digital


footprint.
 Perhaps
 it's
 ingestion
 of


some
 of
 the
 things
 that
 you
 talked
 about


online
 or
 offline.
 Perhaps
 it's
 looking


through
 your
 photo
 roll.
 With
 artificial


intelligence
 or
 Gen
 AI,
 we
 have
 a
 net


new
 wave
 of
 companies
 that
 really
 help


you
 do
 work
 better,
 think
 better,
 and


get
 information
 easier.
 We
 have
 been


blessed
 by
 an
 incredible
 revolution
 in


AI
 today.
 What
 I
 get
 really
 excited


about
 is
 what
 is
 the
 next
 steps
 and
 what


can
 be
 done.
 I
 get
 very
 excited
 to
 think


about
 the
 next
 suite
 of
 products
 that


would
 start
 addressing
 and
 helping


people
 feel
 like
 they're
 being
 seen
 by


others.


Hey,
 I'm
 David
 Haver,
 general
 partner


here
 at
 A16C
 and
 I
 help
 co-lead
 the
 AI


apps
 fund.
 My
 big
 idea
 for
 2026
 is


looking
 for
 companies
 where
 AI


reinforces
 the
 business
 model.
 You
 know,


I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 narrative


around
 AI
 helping
 automate
 work
 and


reducing
 cost.
 But
 I
 think
 in
 instances


where
 AI
 is
 actually
 reinforcing
 the


business
 model
 in
 driving
 revenue,


there's
 really
 no
 limit
 to
 the
 amount


that
 customers
 may
 want
 to
 adopt
 that


technology.
 And
 so
 the
 market
 pull
 in


examples
 like
 that
 are
 just,
 you
 know,


so
 much
 stronger
 than
 than
 those
 where


it's
 just
 a
 cost
 reduction
 story.
 I
 sit


on
 the
 board
 of
 a
 company
 called
 EVE,


which
 operates
 in
 the
 plaintiff
 law


space.
 And
 what's
 unique
 about
 plaintiff


law
 is
 that
 those
 attorneys
 don't
 charge


by
 the
 hour.
 They
 operate
 on
 a


contingency
 basis,
 which
 which
 means


that
 they
 only
 get
 paid
 if
 they
 win.
 And


so
 again,
 while
 AI
 is
 helping
 automate
 a


lot
 of
 the
 drafting
 and
 reasoning
 work


that
 they
 do,
 ultimately
 it's
 it's


really
 about
 enabling
 them
 to
 take
 on


more
 clients
 and
 make
 more
 money.
 So
 it


doesn't
 erode,
 you
 know,
 the
 billable


hour.
 It
 really
 reinforces
 their


business
 model.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 the


market
 pull
 for
 Eve's
 kind
 of
 AI


workspace
 has
 just
 been
 tremendous.


Another
 example
 in
 our
 portfolio
 is
 a


company
 called
 Salient
 which
 operates
 in


the
 uh
 loan
 servicing
 space.
 So
 they're


applying
 voice
 agents
 to
 they
 started
 in


uh
 auto
 lending
 but
 they've
 expanded
 to


a
 whole
 ecosystem
 of
 kind
 of
 consumer


lending
 products
 where
 you
 know
 a
 voice


agent
 can
 speak
 in
 50
 languages
 fully


compliantly
 track
 UDAP
 do
 welcome
 calls


and
 payment
 reminders
 and
 obviously
 you


know
 there
 is
 a
 cost
 reduction
 story
 in


that
 right
 it
 is
 helping
 drive


efficiencies
 in
 many
 of
 these
 bank
 and


non-bank
 lenders
 who
 have
 large
 call


centers
 but
 I
 think
 what's
 what
 they


found
 which
 is
 so
 remarkable
 is
 that
 the


voice
 agents
 are
 actually
 driving
 better


collection
 rates,
 right?
 So,
 it's
 not


just
 a
 cost
 reduction
 story.
 It's


actually
 delivering,
 you
 know,
 better


outcomes,
 you
 know,
 for
 their
 end


customers.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 um,
 it's


reinforcing,
 you
 know,
 the
 lender


business
 model.
 Ultimately,
 where
 did


the
 sources
 of
 compounding
 competitive


advantage,
 you
 know,
 reside
 in
 in
 AI


applications
 and
 I
 think
 Eve
 is
 a


really,
 uh,
 unique
 kind
 of
 example
 and


case
 study
 for
 this.
 You
 know,


ultimately
 the
 founders
 of
 Eve
 had
 a


vision
 for,
 you
 know,
 owning
 the
 kind
 of


endto-end
 workflow
 from
 intake,
 you


know,
 to
 outcome.
 And
 I
 think
 you
 know


deeply
 embed
 embedding
 yourself
 within


your
 customer
 having
 them
 you
 know
 live


within
 the
 product
 you
 know
 every
 day
 as


a
 source
 of
 defensibility.
 I
 think


they're
 also
 creating
 a
 a
 really
 unique


data
 asset,
 right?
 Ultimately
 by
 being


able
 to
 process
 cases
 again
 from
 intake


all
 the
 way
 to
 outcomes
 that
 outcomes


data
 is
 not
 public,
 right?
 That
 is
 not
 a


source
 of
 information
 that
 you
 know


model
 companies
 and
 labs
 can
 actually


train
 on
 and
 you
 know
 on
 the
 public


internet.
 And
 so,
 you
 know,
 ultimately


that
 that
 outcomes
 data
 is
 is
 used
 to


better
 inform
 smarter
 intake
 so
 that
 Eve


can
 tell
 their
 their
 customers,
 look,


this
 case
 has
 these
 characteristics
 to


potentially
 be
 worth,
 you
 know,
 $50,000.


This
 case
 is
 potentially
 worth
 $5


million.
 Here's
 how
 you
 may
 want
 to


triage,
 you
 know,
 your
 labor
 and
 your


time.
 And
 ultimately,
 you
 know,
 given


this
 counterparty,
 you
 know,
 what
 are


the
 characteristics
 that
 you
 may
 want
 to


put
 into
 a
 demand
 letter
 to
 actually


affect
 better
 outcomes?
 And
 so
 I
 think


the
 more
 cases
 that
 EES
 processes,
 you


know,
 the
 smarter
 and
 more
 powerful
 the


platform
 becomes.
 Again,
 ultimately


reinforcing
 the
 business
 model
 for
 their


clients
 because,
 you
 know,
 they
 only
 get


paid
 if
 they
 win.
