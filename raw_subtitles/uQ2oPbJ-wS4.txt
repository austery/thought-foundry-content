Hello,
 OddLots
 listeners.
 You
 are


listening
 to
 another
 episode
 that
 was


recorded
 live
 in
 New
 York
 City
 at
 our


event
 on
 June
 26th.
 This
 time
 it's
 with


the
 one
 and
 only
 Nim
 Nicholas
 Taleb,


distinguished
 scientist
 and
 adviser
 at


Universa
 Investments.


Yep.
 We
 talked
 to
 him
 about
 how
 to
 live


a
 good
 life
 in
 a
 time
 of
 immense


volatility.
 Take
 a
 listen.
 Nim,
 what's


your
 definition
 of
 a
 good
 life?
 What


should
 we
 be
 aiming
 for?


Uh


I
 mean
 the
 the
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 think


that
 we're
 programmed
 to
 be
 happy
 and


stuff
 like
 that.
 In
 fact,
 we're


programmed
 to
 feel
 useful.


That's
 a
 good
 life.
 Or
 I
 mean
 you
 don't


have
 to
 be
 martyr
 to
 feel
 useful.
 As
 a


matter
 of
 fact,
 martyrs
 go
 too
 far
 and


if
 you
 look
 at
 their
 death
 typically
 in


history,
 you
 realize
 they
 could
 have


waited
 a
 decade
 and
 the
 problem
 was


solved
 itself
 by
 self,
 right?
 So
 think


of
 all
 the
 wars
 and
 hey
 the
 Vietnam
 war


took
 care
 of
 the
 self
 or
 the
 so


whatever.
 So,
 so
 let's
 forget
 about


martyrdom
 except
 of
 course
 in
 narrow


cases
 where
 you
 save
 someone.
 So
 the


idea
 is
 to
 be
 useful
 to
 others


and
 then
 the
 idea
 is
 you
 know
 to
 share


your
 mistakes
 as
 you
 grow
 in
 age
 to


share
 your
 mistakes
 with
 society
 so
 they


can
 build
 on
 it.
 That's
 my
 idea
 of
 a


good
 life.
 For
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 good


life
 is
 hydonic
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 they


have
 a
 chef
 flown
 in
 from
 Europe
 to
 eat


some
 complicated
 food
 uh
 that
 our
 friend


here,
 you
 know,
 just
 would
 not
 approve


eating,
 you
 know,
 not
 nonstakes
 and


complicated
 thing
 with
 long
 long
 names


and
 uh
 so
 that
 that's
 a
 hydonic
 approach


to
 things.
 Mine
 is
 you
 feel
 useful.
 So


whether
 you
 have
 a
 family
 and
 you're


providing
 for
 them
 or
 if
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 don't
 have
 a
 family
 yet
 or


may
 not
 have
 a
 family
 because
 in
 the


past
 most
 people
 didn't
 have
 a
 family
 a


lot
 of
 people
 were
 orphans
 a
 lot
 of


people
 were
 uh
 had
 didn't
 had
 children


who
 didn't
 survive
 so
 the
 idea
 is
 to
 be


useful
 to
 the
 community
 in
 general


so
 we
 talked
 about
 this
 in
 the
 market


context
 at
 the
 very
 beginning
 but
 does


you
 know
 I
 feel
 this
 poll
 to
 basically


always
 look
 at
 my
 phone
 to
 monitor
 the


latest
 headlines.
 Sometimes
 I
 don't


think
 like
 I'm
 the
 best
 parent
 because


I'm
 looking
 at
 my
 phone
 when
 I
 should
 be


with
 my
 family
 as
 you
 mentioned.


How
 do
 we
 be
 useful?


Bombarded
 time
 we're
 just
 being


bombarded
 with
 events
 beyond
 our


control.


Okay.
 Yeah.
 But
 but
 you're
 we're
 better


off
 than
 we
 were
 today.
 Um
 40
 years
 50


years
 ago
 before
 many
 were
 born
 perhaps


even
 you.
 Right.


Yeah.


So
 the
 you
 don't
 realize
 that
 we
 spend


about
 a
 century


in
 front
 of
 a
 TV
 set.


Oh
 that's
 right.


Or
 reading
 papers
 where
 you're
 on
 a


receiving
 end


but
 not
 providing
 anything
 in
 return.
 So


it
 was
 a
 centralized
 information
 uh
 era


that
 started
 you
 know
 uh
 with
 modernity


and
 and
 you
 realize
 you
 should
 see
 the


families
 eating
 their
 dinner
 in
 front
 of


the
 TV
 set.
 Basically
 you're
 receiving


information
 whereas
 organically
 in
 the


past
 the
 way
 we
 dealt
 with
 information


was
 by
 trading
 it.
 It's
 like
 Twitter.


You
 you
 you
 give
 information,
 you


receive
 information.
 So
 you
 go
 to
 the


barber,
 someone
 gives
 you
 information,


and
 then
 you
 go
 to
 buy
 fish,
 you
 give


the
 fish
 monger
 information,
 and
 then


rumors
 start
 going.
 So,
 and
 now
 we're


close
 to
 that
 period
 because
 you're
 not


just
 receiving
 stuff,
 you're
 also


tweeting,
 you
 know,
 so
 although
 your


spouse,
 I'm
 sure,
 tells
 you
 not
 to
 tweet


from
 home.
 That's
 wrong.
 That's
 correct.


That's
 correct.
 Okay.
 I
 guess


it's
 true.
 When
 we're
 trying
 to
 get


Joe's
 attention,
 we
 send
 a
 DM
 doesn't


respond
 to
 anything.


So,
 I'm
 sure
 he's
 tweeting.
 So
 you're


feeling
 you're
 not
 just
 receiving
 noise,


but
 you're
 creating.


So
 I'm
 contributing.
 I'm
 being
 useful
 by


contributing
 to
 the
 noise.
 Thank
 you.


Thank
 very
 validating.


Wait,
 but
 do
 you
 personally
 enjoy
 being


on
 Twitter?
 Because
 I
 read
 some
 of
 your


tweets
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 sometimes
 you


seem
 a
 little
 angry.


No.
 So
 just
 a
 little
 if
 I
 were
 tweeting


now
 in
 front
 of
 all
 of
 you.


Yeah.


The
 tweet
 would
 look
 angry
 but
 my
 face


I'm
 often
 giggling
 when
 I'm
 tweeting.


All right.
 I'm
 often
 giggling.
 So,
 the


idea
 is
 to
 separate
 your
 your
 uh
 public


persona
 from
 your
 private
 life.


By
 the
 way,
 before
 we
 forget,
 before
 you


leave
 tonight,
 someone
 DM'd
 me
 and
 said,


"Can
 you
 please
 ask
 Nim
 to
 unblock
 me
 on


Twitter?
 I
 get
 these
 all
 the
 time.
 It's


probably
 the
 most


remind
 me
 before
 you
 leave.
 It's
 a


seemed
 like
 a
 nice
 guy."
 And
 so,


they
 all
 say,
 "Oh,
 sorry.
 I
 had
 a
 drink


or
 I
 don't
 know."


Wait,
 we
 should
 actually
 because
 of


Bitcoin
 because
 I
 chain
 blocked.
 No,


when
 you
 have
 a
 smear
 campaign,


you
 chain
 block.


So
 the
 friends,
 if
 someone
 bullies
 you


or
 pro,
 you
 you
 block


their
 friends


as
 well.
 Making
 it
 was
 possible
 at
 a


time.


Wait,
 how
 many
 people
 here
 have
 been


personally
 blocked
 by
 Nim
 Taleb?


Not
 that
 many.
 Not
 that
 many.
 It's
 a


small
 number.


It's
 not
 because
 No,
 no,
 no.
 a
 random


room
 in
 New
 York.


I
 stopped
 I
 stopped
 a
 couple
 of
 years


ago
 from
 using
 the
 chain
 blocker.


Yeah.


One
 because
 it
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 type
 two


error
 that
 the
 you
 know
 the
 false


positives
 and
 uh
 the
 other
 reason
 is
 uh


because
 when
 Elon
 took
 Twitter
 he
 banned


these
 uh
 bots.


Yeah.


So
 so
 they
 can't
 operate
 anymore.
 You


got
 to
 do
 it
 manually.


Oh
 like
 the
 third
 party
 apps
 that
 you


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Exactly.
 They
 could
 use
 to


block
 someone
 their
 friends
 the
 friends


of
 their
 friends.
 a
 friend
 and
 friends


of
 the
 friends
 and
 all
 of
 that
 to


yourself.


[Music]


Are
 you
 surprised
 that
 in
 a
 year
 of
 just


like
 unbelievable
 headlines
 seemingly


day
 after
 day
 multiple
 wars
 going
 on
 not


to
 mention
 the
 trade
 war
 and
 all
 of
 that


everything
 else
 Doge
 etc
 that
 the


markets
 are
 not


crazier
 than
 they
 are


let
 me
 compose
 a
 tweet
 that
 maybe
 I'll


post


is
 uh
 for
 Trump
 one
 okay
 Trump
 one
 was


taken
 uh
 literally
 by
 his
 enemies
 by
 his


uh
 and
 metaphorically
 by
 his
 friends.


Okay.


Trump
 too
 is
 taken
 metaphorically
 by
 his


enemies


and
 literally
 by
 his
 friends.


Explain.


So
 whatever
 he's
 saying
 now,
 he's
 pretty


much
 doing
 I
 did
 you
 believe
 that
 he
 was


going
 to
 start
 these
 tariffs.
 They
 make


no
 sense.
 I
 mean
 it
 make
 sense
 to
 get


elected
 in
 Pennsylvania,
 but
 but
 I
 mean


it's
 not
 a
 kind
 of
 thing
 you
 do
 really.


And
 and
 it
 turned
 out
 he
 he
 meant
 it.
 It


was
 not
 just,
 you
 know,
 uh,


a
 vague,
 uh,
 it's
 really
 an
 oral


metaphor.
 It
 was
 real.
 He
 wants
 tariffs.


So
 maybe
 he
 wants
 to
 destroy
 the


American
 economy.
 Maybe
 that's
 his
 wish.


And,
 uh,
 and
 you
 could
 probably
 put
 a


dent.


And
 yet,
 but
 it's
 not
 work
 where
 stock


market's
 at
 alltime
 high.


Sorry.


The
 stock
 market
 is


first
 of
 all,
 you
 have
 to
 separate
 the


health
 of
 American
 companies.


No,
 I
 get
 that.
 your
 the
 income
 of
 the


American
 who
 went
 to
 uh
 Stop
 and
 Shop
 or


what's
 this
 thing
 in
 your
 area?
 Not


Whole
 Foods.
 You
 know,
 you
 guys
 go
 to


Whole
 Food,
 but
 normal
 people
 go
 to


Costco,
 whatever.
 Then
 you
 look
 at
 your


bill,
 right?
 And
 and
 the
 bill
 went
 up


practically
 for
 everything
 and
 their


income
 did
 not.
 and
 tax
 breaks
 to
 come


are
 not
 going
 to
 help


those
 who
 don't
 shop
 at
 tofu
 because


it's
 the
 the


the
 poor
 people
 you
 don't
 pay
 taxes


anyway
 so
 so
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 get


break
 from
 that
 so
 the
 idea
 is
 there's
 a


lunacy
 in
 in
 these
 tariffs
 I
 can


understand
 that
 we
 need
 to
 protect


pharma


we
 have
 some
 strategic
 interest
 in
 this


okay
 you
 protect
 the
 industry
 you
 want


to
 make
 sure
 you
 don't
 depend
 on
 China


for
 other
 things
 but
 it
 it's
 a
 lunacy
 to


try
 to
 switch
 with
 4%
 unemployment
 in


America


plus
 or
 minus


from
 high
 margin
 you
 guys
 are
 all
 hard


margin
 all
 right
 to
 low
 margin
 right


high
 margin
 audience


yeah
 we
 have
 a
 high
 margin
 audience
 to


low
 margin
 right
 occupations


right


so
 now
 we're
 going
 to
 make
 socks
 can
 you


imagine
 the
 high
 margin
 so
 making
 u


making
 films
 we're
 going
 to
 make
 socks


and
 and
 then
 also
 misperception
 of
 the


whole
 process
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 in
 um


in
 in
 basic
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 trade


accounting
 like
 uh
 they
 say
 oh
 they're


rip
 they're
 ripping
 us
 off
 I
 mean
 I'm
 a


dentist
 all right
 and
 I
 go
 buy
 my
 bread


it's
 ripping
 me
 off
 right
 I
 should
 make


my
 own
 bread
 and
 and
 then
 the
 president


probably
 the
 baker
 should
 be
 a
 dentist


so
 the
 the
 whole
 the
 whole
 idea
 is
 not


is
 it
 doesn't
 stand
 on
 and
 plus
 they


have
 You
 you
 know
 if
 someone
 is
 not
 very


intelligent
 or
 not
 very
 skilled
 and
 you


can
 detect
 that
 at
 at
 it's
 like


arbitragees.
 You
 guys
 are
 from
 financial


audience
 and
 we
 call
 that
 trading


against
 themselves.
 They
 do
 a
 series
 of


trades
 that
 end
 up
 being
 closing
 a
 loop


being
 circular
 but
 was
 a
 loss.
 All


right.
 They
 used
 to
 call
 that
 Texas


trades
 but
 I
 think
 that
 the
 state
 of


Texas
 has
 been
 uh
 unfairly
 you
 know


defamed.
 Yeah.
 Know
 Texas
 trades
 in


general.
 One
 of
 them
 is
 Texas
 Hedge,


right?
 So
 the
 So
 for
 example,
 they
 have


tariffs
 on
 components
 that
 you
 would
 use


to
 build
 a
 computer
 in
 your
 basement
 in


New
 York.
 Okay?
 But
 if
 you
 bought
 an


Apple
 product,
 then
 there's
 no
 tariff.


Although
 that's
 made
 in
 over
 everything


is
 made
 overseas,
 manufactured.
 Okay.
 So


this
 is
 an
 inconsistency.


So
 there
 are
 plenty
 like
 that.


Sure.


And
 there's
 also
 what's
 his
 name?
 Um
 the


secretary
 of
 treasury
 is
 like
 secretary


not
 treasury
 secretary
 of
 commerce


is
 yeah
 he
 he
 he
 definitely
 someone


should
 hire
 him
 for
 comedy
 because
 he


was
 saying
 first
 of
 all
 he
 wants
 he
 he


he
 he
 doesn't
 the
 inconsistency
 he


didn't
 realize
 he
 said
 oh
 we're
 going
 to


raise
 so
 much
 money
 from
 tariffs
 and
 and


and
 then
 when
 you
 ask
 him
 you
 mean
 that


the
 economy
 will
 not
 adapt
 to
 your


tariffs
 by
 by
 replacement
 he
 didn't


think
 about
 it
 and
 and and
 he
 wants
 us


to
 produce
 to
 pay
 tariffs
 on
 bananas


so
 we're
 gonna
 have
 substitutes
 or
 he
 he


spoke
 about
 wine
 he
 said
 oh
 people
 will


buy
 American
 wine
 but
 what
 happens
 if


French
 the
 price
 of
 French
 wine
 goes
 up


okay


there's
 something
 called
 substitution
 I


don't
 know
 if
 people
 do
 that
 in
 Europe


they
 teach
 high
 school
 economics
 I
 mean


for
 ch
 children
 where
 they
 teach


substitution
 right
 so
 it's
 elementary
 me


I
 mean
 I'm
 saying
 that
 he
 Trump
 should


have
 hired


If
 you
 if
 you
 could
 find
 people
 who
 have


some
 skills.
 All right.


I
 can't
 wait
 to
 develop
 my
 skills


growing
 my
 own
 bananas.
 Banana
 arti.


Sorry,
 I
 can't
 talk
 tonight.
 Okay.
 I
 was


going
 to
 ask,
 you
 always
 preach
 skin
 in


the
 game.


Um
 unlike
 us
 journalists.


So,
 I
 got
 to
 ask,
 you're
 still
 an


adviser
 to
 Universa.
 What's
 been
 going


on
 there?
 What
 are
 your
 returns
 like?


Give
 us
 all
 the
 numbers.


Okay.
 No,
 I
 so
 this
 is
 not
 the
 place
 to


discuss
 numbers.


Uh
 you
 won't
 get
 all
 right
 but
 you
 can


get
 a
 general
 approach
 and
 philosophy
 uh


that
 I
 have
 now
 to
 describe
 in
 in
 a
 in
 a


format
 compressed
 format
 of
 what
 we
 do


and
 how
 we
 do
 it.
 Um
 we
 can
 safely
 say


that
 as
 usual
 uh
 whatever
 we're
 doing


worked
 okay
 in
 a
 sense
 that
 the
 idea
 the


idea
 let
 me
 the
 idea
 the
 idea
 is
 that


you
 got
 to
 look
 at
 the
 return
 of
 that


hedge


you
 got
 to
 return
 the
 portfolio
 that
 was


hedged
 because
 sort
 of
 like
 when
 you


when
 you
 have
 an
 insurance
 on
 your
 house


all right
 you
 look
 at
 the
 package
 house


plus
 insurance
 you
 don't
 look
 at


insurance
 as
 a
 tradable
 think
 today
 I'm


not
 going
 to
 have
 insurance,
 tomorrow


I'll
 have
 or
 how
 is
 that
 paying
 off?
 You


look
 at
 the
 package.
 Okay,
 insurance


allows
 you
 to
 buy
 a
 bigger
 house


because
 you
 know
 your
 your
 total
 risk
 is


lower
 in
 the
 case
 of
 stuff
 like
 that.


So,
 it's
 the
 same
 situation
 and
 and
 the


stock
 market
 rallied


which
 which
 mean
 that
 not
 only
 did
 the


hedge


do
 okay,
 but
 it
 wasn't
 needed.


So,
 you're
 like
 making
 money
 on
 your


insurance.
 So
 netn
 net
 that
 story


continued
 and
 we've
 been
 doing
 it
 now


for
 uh


time
 flies.
 Uh
 we're
 in
 2025


25
 minus
 uh
 oh
 it's
 a
 lot
 right
 so
 we've


done
 it
 for
 18
 years


18
 19
 years
 directly
 was
 universal
 and


then
 before
 of
 course
 an
 iteration


before
 and
 it
 is
 that
 it's
 the
 same


story
 we
 didn't
 change
 strategy
 for
 a


second
 and
 uh
 we
 will
 not
 change


strategy
 so
 basically
 that's
 what
 we
 do


is
 the
 same
 thing
 it's
 just
 it's
 getting


bigger
 that's
 it


well
 wait
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 more


volatility
 events
 nowadays.
 Do
 you
 not


adapt
 to
 that
 at
 all
 or
 take
 that?
 Well,


let
 me
 tell
 you
 if
 you
 look
 net
 net


first
 of
 all
 I
 don't
 look
 at
 volatility


as
 volatility


okay


in
 in
 my
 technical
 work
 and
 universal


doesn't
 look
 at
 vol
 you
 look
 at


for
 example
 you
 can
 have
 a
 tail
 event


and
 then
 you
 can
 have
 or
 you
 can
 have


regular
 volatility
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 people


are
 overall
 by
 regular
 volatility
 and


typically
 what
 they
 call
 regular


volatility
 I
 learned
 the
 linguistics
 of


of
 that
 business
 is
 when
 the
 market
 goes


down
 they
 don't
 in
 the
 old
 days
 when


they're
 losing
 money
 they
 would
 Okay.


All
 the
 markets
 are
 volatile.
 Volatile


doesn't
 mean
 it's
 going
 up.
 Volatile
 is


not
 an
 absolute
 uh
 mean
 deviation.


Volatile
 is
 negative
 return.
 All right.


So,
 so
 a
 lot
 of
 perception
 of
 things
 of


volatility
 by
 exact.
 I
 mean
 your


profession
 journalist
 is
 of
 course
 very


important
 that
 way
 you
 can
 reveal


uh
 uh
 bad
 stuff
 when
 it's
 made
 and


things
 like
 that.
 But
 but
 often


did
 Nim
 just
 say
 something
 nice
 about


journalism?


Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 no,
 there
 are a
 lot
 of


things.
 It's
 an
 important
 mission.
 uh


but
 but
 but
 very
 often
 uh
 there's
 the


scaling
 doesn't
 uh
 doesn't
 quite
 match


like
 for
 example
 people
 in
 journalism


and
 this
 I
 wrote
 about
 in
 fooled
 by


randomness


you
 should
 have
 newspapers
 or
 they
 say


length
 of
 newspapers
 now
 we
 don't
 have


newspaper
 but
 you
 understand
 what
 I
 mean


there
 should
 be
 on
 days
 like
 the
 stock


market
 crash
 or
 on
 last
 couple
 of
 weeks


newspapers
 should
 be
 that
 big
 and
 the


rest
 of
 the
 time
 should
 be
 half
 a
 page


but
 they
 have
 the
 same
 length


All
 right.
 So
 that's
 the
 scaling
 problem


in
 journalism.
 In
 other
 words,
 you
 have


the
 news
 14
 and
 a
 half
 minutes
 plus,
 you


know,
 of
 course
 the
 Bloomberg
 uh
 ad
 in


the
 middle.
 So
 so
 the
 I
 mean
 that
 that


news
 bulletin
 should
 be
 variable
 with


with
 with
 with
 the
 events.
 You
 see
 the


idea?
 So
 same
 thing
 with
 market


movement.
 So
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 we
 are


experiencing
 real
 volatility


compared
 to
 what
 could
 have
 happened
 and


what
 we
 have
 seen
 with
 explosive
 uh


markets.
 Yes.


So,
 as
 mentioned,


multiple
 wars
 going
 on.
 Uh
 we
 had
 the


COVID
 shock,
 we
 had
 the
 inflation
 shock,


we
 have
 massive
 changes
 happening
 in
 the


political
 landscape
 including
 uh
 right


here
 in
 New
 York
 City.
 Is
 there
 an


underlying
 reason
 in
 your
 view
 why
 it


feels
 as
 though
 big
 things
 are


happening?
 No
 my
 whole
 point
 is
 that


what
 to
 go
 back
 to
 is
 go
 back
 to
 tail
 to


to
 what
 we
 call
 about
 fat
 tail.
 Fat


tales
 means
 the
 smallest
 number
 of
 event


explains
 the
 largest
 number
 of
 uh


deviations.
 For
 example,
 if
 you
 take
 a


thousand
 people
 and
 you
 have
 inequality,


one
 person
 will
 have
 most
 of
 the
 money.


Likewise,
 few
 historical
 days
 have
 most


of
 the
 information.


Mh.


Like
 likewise.
 So
 this
 is
 entirely


normal.
 The
 point
 is
 you
 can't
 you


couldn't
 predict
 ahead
 of
 time
 that


you're
 going
 to
 have
 when
 you're
 going


to
 have
 these
 days
 or
 you're
 going
 to


have
 the
 structure
 of
 it
 is
 though
 very


very
 uh
 uh
 stable.
 It
 is
 things
 follow


tend
 to
 follow
 a
 power
 law.
 So


go
 ahead.


Oh
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 a
 very
 basic


question
 that
 I'm
 sure
 you
 get
 asked
 all


the
 time
 but
 we
 are
 all
 nevertheless


very
 interested
 in
 your
 answer.
 Um,
 by


definition,
 black
 swans,
 I
 guess,
 are


unpredictable
 um,
 and
 impossible
 to


forecast.
 But
 what
 black
 swans
 do
 you


see
 on
 the
 horizon?


Okay,
 so
 this


let
 me
 rephrase.
 Let
 me
 rephrase
 it.


Okay,
 there's
 something
 called
 gray


swans.
 All
 right.
 So
 great
 pandemics


were
 gray
 swans
 or
 or
 you
 know
 gray


swans
 means
 events
 that
 have
 these


characteristics
 of
 very
 small
 number
 of


events
 determine


large
 part
 of
 the
 total
 effect
 like


small
 a
 small
 number
 of
 events
 uh
 small


number
 of
 wars
 that
 killed
 most
 of


people
 stuff
 like
 that
 pandemics.
 So


there's
 grace
 sworns
 and
 you
 can
 say


they
 have
 a
 structure.
 You
 predict
 them


ahead
 of
 time.
 You
 don't
 know.
 Okay.
 But


what
 we
 do
 is
 you
 can
 figure
 out
 if
 an


environment
 is
 fragile
 or
 not.
 And
 in
 a


fragile
 environments
 you
 can
 say
 okay


this
 is
 prone
 to
 break
 if
 there's
 a


shock.
 Like
 in
 2007
 we
 knew
 that
 banks


were
 fragile.


Why?
 They
 were
 net
 short
 volatility.


That's
 sort
 of
 my
 fragility
 work
 in


antifragile.
 To
 answer
 your
 question,
 I


wrote
 antifragile,
 which
 on
 its
 own


became
 a
 monster,
 right?
 But
 but
 the
 the


whole
 idea
 is
 to
 figure
 out
 what
 can
 be


uh
 have
 cascading
 effects
 from
 shocks.


Okay,
 as
 I
 wrote
 to
 the
 black
 swan,
 it's


foolish
 to
 say
 what
 color
 truck
 is
 going


to
 break
 a
 fragile
 bridge.
 Okay,
 but
 it


is
 not
 foolish
 to
 say
 this
 bridge
 is


fragile.
 It's
 going
 to
 break
 one
 day.


Don't
 cross
 it.
 Don't
 don't
 or
 or
 or or


or
 invite
 your
 enemies
 to
 you
 know


Okay.
 Okay.
 What
 what
 areas
 of
 fragility


do
 you
 see
 right
 now?


So
 the
 first
 one
 I'm
 learning.


Yeah.
 The
 fir
 Okay.
 So
 the
 first
 Yeah.


The
 the
 first
 one
 is
 we
 have
 a
 I
 don't


know
 if
 you're
 aware
 of
 it.
 Maybe
 people


aren't
 aware
 yet
 that
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 we


know
 we
 have
 a
 deficit.


Oh,
 I
 heard
 about
 this.
 And
 you
 know


that
 that
 you
 have
 to
 borrow,


you
 know,
 to
 pay
 for
 the
 interest
 rates


for
 the
 interest
 uh
 uh
 ex
 you
 know
 the


the
 uh


the
 the
 debt
 that
 you've
 had
 before.


And
 at
 four
 north
 of
 4%
 interest
 rates,


four
 to
 5%
 interest
 rate,
 this
 is


significant
 means
 you
 can
 have
 a


snowballing
 effect.
 You
 had
 to
 borrow


more
 and
 more
 and
 you
 know
 that
 they're


not
 fixing
 the
 budget
 problem
 except


verbally.
 Hey,
 we're
 going
 to
 fix
 the


budget.
 You
 know,
 it's
 all
 the
 same


story.
 Uh
 the
 structure
 of
 the
 political


system
 unfortunately
 is
 driving
 us


there.
 Okay.
 So,
 this
 is
 one
 source
 of


fragility,
 one
 main
 source
 of
 fragility.


Okay.
 That
 the
 political
 system
 is
 not


adapted
 to
 that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 So,
 what


happened
 in
 the
 western
 world,
 it's
 not


just
 a
 case
 of
 United
 States.
 It's
 a


case
 of
 the
 western
 world
 because
 you


got
 to
 look
 at
 it
 as
 I
 describe
 in


antifragiles.
 Think
 of
 an
 S-curve


like
 China
 can
 have
 rapid
 growth
 because


they're
 pulling
 people
 out
 of
 their


beautifully
 landscaped
 countryside
 to


pull
 them
 in
 apartment
 blocks
 that
 maybe


it's
 not
 pleasant
 for
 for
 the
 people,


you
 know,
 to
 to
 live
 in
 in
 boxes,
 but


that
 generates
 a
 huge
 amount
 of
 economic


growth.
 Okay.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 going


up
 the
 so-called
 development
 scale.


You're
 you're
 on
 the
 convex
 part
 of
 the


S-curve.
 Okay.
 The
 west
 is
 on
 a
 concave


part
 of
 the
 escort.


So
 which
 means
 that


you
 have
 two
 car
 most
 except
 New
 York


New
 Yorkers
 live
 in
 small
 boxes
 like


like
 like
 uh
 poor
 people
 in
 middle
 ages


but
 outside
 New
 York
 City
 in
 a
 real
 most


people
 have
 two
 car
 garages
 stuff
 like


that.
 So
 you
 you
 you
 we
 can't
 you
 can't


grow
 right
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 poor


people
 so
 you
 have
 to
 import
 them
 from


El
 Salvador
 Panama
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 you


don't
 have
 poor
 people.
 So,
 so
 you
 don't


to
 create
 that
 kind
 of
 thing
 and
 and
 and


even
 and
 now
 you
 don't
 want
 them


anymore.
 You
 don't
 they
 don't
 want
 you


don't
 want
 everybody,
 you
 know.
 So,
 so


they
 have
 a
 problem
 that
 growth
 in


America
 is
 structurally


declining.


Yeah.


Well,
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 the
 debt
 burden


is
 structurally


increasing.
 You
 see
 that
 diversion
 and


that
 applies
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the


developer
 because
 you
 develop,
 you're


arriving
 to
 destination.
 Why
 are
 you


still
 borrowing?
 The
 problem
 is
 most


countries
 tend
 to
 borrow
 when
 they're


already
 rich,
 when
 they
 don't
 need
 it


anymore.
 Just
 like
 people,
 see
 like


people
 on
 Wall
 Street.
 These
 people
 are


on
 Wall
 Street.
 They
 probably
 borrow
 a


lot
 now
 already
 rich.
 All right?
 Whereas


poor
 people
 don't
 borrow.
 So
 that's
 a


big
 problem.
 That's
 number
 one
 problem.


The
 second
 one
 is
 China
 is
 representing


a
 larger
 larger
 share
 of
 GDP
 of
 the


world.
 And
 so
 you're
 going
 to
 think
 that


geopolitics
 aren't
 going
 to
 be
 the
 same.


And
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 live,
 you
 know,
 in


the
 wrong
 century.
 Think
 you're
 living


in
 this
 century,
 think
 you're
 in
 a


different
 century.


All
 right,
 Nimb.
 Yeah.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.


Thanks.
 Thanks
 for
 eating
 cow
 meat


and
 thanks
 for
 the
 steak.


So,
 next
 time,
 let's
 make
 sure
 either


have
 organ
 food
 or
 bring
 wine.


We'll
 definitely
 have
 wine.
 Thank
 you
 so


much.
