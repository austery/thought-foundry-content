>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 All
 Thoughts
 Podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> Joe,
 I
 have
 a
 very
 personal
 question
 to


ask
 you.


Well,
 we've
 known
 each
 other
 for
 a
 very


long
 time,
 so
 there's
 not
 much
 left
 that


we
 don't
 know,
 but
 go
 for
 it.


>> Well,
 I
 actually
 don't
 know
 the
 answer


to
 this
 question.
 Um,
 have
 you
 ever


baked
 anything?


>> Uh,


not
 that
 much.
 I
 went
 through
 this
 like


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 The
 answer
 is


basically
 no.
 I'm
 just
 No.


>> Wait,
 you
 were
 going
 to
 say
 something.


You
 went
 through
 a
 phase.
 One
 time
 in


high
 school,
 I
 got
 in
 this
 like
 weird


like
 experimental
 baking
 obsession
 with


a
 friend
 of
 mine
 where
 we
 just
 sort
 of


tried
 to
 relearn
 baking
 by
 first


principles
 and
 see
 what
 worked.


>> Oh
 my
 god,
 what
 does
 that
 mean?


>> Just
 like
 not
 reading
 any
 recipe.
 I
 just


So,
 not
 reading
 any
 recipes
 and
 just


start
 experimenting
 and
 then
 seeing
 like


what
 caused
 things
 to
 rise
 and
 what


tasted
 good
 without
 any
 starting


principles
 or
 anything.
 We
 knew
 a
 few


basic
 ingredients.
 It's
 fun.
 I
 should


get
 back
 into
 baking.


>> You
 should.
 It's
 really
 fun.


>> What
 do
 you
 Tracy?
 We
 know
 this
 is
 just


a
 setup
 because
 you
 want
 to
 talk
 about


your
 baking.
 So,
 why
 don't
 you
 just
 why


don't
 you
 just
 tell
 us
 what
 you
 like
 to


bake?


>> Hey,
 look.
 I
 don't
 bake
 that
 much.


Actually,
 in
 my
 household,
 my
 husband


bakes
 everything.
 So,
 he
 does
 a
 really


good
 Basque
 cheesecake,
 really
 good


chocolate
 chip
 cookies,
 things
 like


that.
 But
 if
 you
 were
 doing
 first


principle
 baking,
 I
 imagine
 you
 know
 how


difficult
 it
 is
 and
 all
 the
 things
 that


are
 involved
 in
 just
 making
 like
 a


simple
 loaf
 of
 bread.


>> Uh,
 I
 I
 I
 am
 aware.
 And
 the
 other
 thing


is
 not
 only
 um
 I
 understand
 that
 it's
 uh


very
 complex
 but
 beyond
 that
 I'm
 always


flabbergasted
 at
 the
 idea
 of
 doing
 it
 at


industrial
 scale
 or
 semi-industrial


scale
 and
 how
 that
 even
 works.
 I
 have
 no


idea
 to
 be
 honest.
 Honestly,
 industrial


scale
 food
 preparation
 at
 all
 seems


crazy
 to
 me.
 Like
 stakes
 and
 everything


like
 how
 do
 you
 do
 it
 over
 and
 over
 and


over
 again
 and
 get
 a
 repeatable
 process


is
 like
 a
 fascinating
 question
 to
 me.


>> Right.
 So
 that's
 really
 interesting
 in


and
 of
 itself.
 But
 the
 other
 interesting


thing
 about
 the
 baking
 business
 at


industrial
 scale
 as
 you
 just
 pointed
 out


is
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 microcosm
 for
 the


economy.
 You
 have
 all
 these
 commodity


inputs
 which
 obviously
 move
 around
 along


with
 inflation.
 You
 have
 labor
 issues.


You
 have
 to
 get
 bakers
 who
 want
 to
 get


into
 work
 really
 really
 early
 in
 the


morning
 and
 obviously
 you
 also
 have


consumer
 demand.
 So
 it's
 really
 an


interesting
 lens
 to
 kind
 of
 look


through.
 Well,
 one
 of
 our
 uh
 one
 of
 our


the
 favorite
 episodes
 that
 we've
 ever


done
 I
 which
 I
 think
 was
 2022
 or
 maybe


2021,


>> long
 time
 ago.


>> Uh
 we
 talked
 to
 a
 commercial
 baker
 in


Chicago
 and
 I've
 always
 wanted
 to
 do


more.
 That
 was
 such
 a
 pivotal
 episode


for
 us
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 well,
 you
 know,


we
 learned
 a
 lot
 about
 what
 was
 going
 on


with
 uh
 commodity
 costs.
 We
 learned
 a


lot
 what
 was
 going
 on
 with
 pricing


power,
 etc.
 Well,
 it's
 2025
 now.
 I
 would


like
 to
 learn
 more
 about
 what's
 going


on.


>> All
 right,
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 dive
 back


into
 baking.
 Uh,
 possibly
 not
 on
 a
 first


principle
 basis,
 but
 we
 have
 the
 perfect


guest.
 We're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with


Andy
 Kaden.
 He


>> wouldn't
 baking
 baking
 from
 first


principles
 be
 a
 really
 good
 That
 would


be
 a
 That
 would
 be
 like
 a
 good
 name
 for


a
 cookbook.
 All right,
 sorry.
 Keep


going.


>> Um,
 good
 name
 for
 a
 baking
 podcast,


perhaps.
 Okay,


>> we're
 going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Andy


Kaden.
 He
 is
 the
 owner
 of
 a
 bakery
 in
 LA


that's
 called
 Bub
 and
 Grandmas.
 They
 do


wholesale
 orders
 for
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 LA
 restaurants,
 so
 industrial


scale
 as
 you
 mentioned,
 Joe,
 but
 they


also
 have
 a
 retail
 restaurant
 that
 does


sandwiches
 and
 they're
 in
 the
 process
 of


opening
 a
 pizzeria.
 So
 amazing,


>> all
 the
 baked
 goods.
 Andy,
 welcome
 to


the
 show.


>> Really
 good
 to
 be
 here.
 Thanks
 for


having
 me.


>> Shall
 we
 start
 out
 with
 where
 did
 your


interest
 in
 bread
 actually
 come
 from?


Was
 this
 like
 a
 COVID
 trope
 where


everyone
 started
 doing
 their
 own


sourdough
 and
 got
 really
 into


carbohydrates


>> or
 I
 I
 maybe
 I'm
 a
 little
 uh
 uh


protocoid
 in
 my
 obsession.
 I
 was
 a


writer
 in
 advertising
 and
 TV
 for
 about
 a


decade
 after
 school
 and
 learned
 fairly


quickly
 after
 I
 got
 to
 Los
 Angeles
 about


16
 years
 ago
 that
 I
 hated
 it
 and
 hated


myself
 for
 contributing
 to
 sort
 of
 the


advertising
 culture.
 so
 to
 speak,
 and
 I


needed
 to
 escape
 and
 uh
 always
 had
 an


obsession
 with
 cooking
 and
 eating
 and
 um


decided
 to
 focus
 on
 something
 that
 I
 saw


missing
 from
 the
 Los
 Angeles
 landscape


after
 I
 moved
 here
 from
 the
 East
 Coast.


I
 grew
 up
 in
 New
 Jersey,
 kind
 of
 in
 a


Italian
 Jewish
 sandwich
 mecca.
 uh
 and


saw
 saw
 that
 there
 was
 sort
 of
 a
 a
 a


glaring
 absence
 of
 those
 style
 of
 kind


of
 walk
 into
 it
 and
 have
 a
 great


sandwich
 kind
 of
 experience
 in
 Los


Angeles.
 There
 are
 a
 few
 notable
 spots,


but
 they
 aren't
 everywhere
 like
 they
 are


in
 New
 York
 and
 New
 Jersey.
 So,
 I


decided
 to
 start
 writing
 some
 business


plans
 and
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 open
 a


sandwich
 shop
 here.
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,


started
 working
 at
 a
 sandwich
 shop
 in


Hollywood
 called
 Potato
 Chips
 for
 free


on
 the
 weekends,
 staging
 at
 a
 variety
 of


bakeries
 just
 to
 try
 and
 figure
 out
 how


bread
 worked.
 And
 and
 in
 that
 process
 of


trying
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 bread
 worked,


simply
 just
 to
 talk
 to
 bakers
 about
 what


I
 wanted.
 I
 started
 baking
 daily
 at
 home


and
 got
 into
 that
 pseudocoid
 rhythm
 of


daily
 baking
 and
 the
 obsession
 of
 that


that
 comes
 from
 falling
 into
 its
 uh
 you


know
 into
 its
 grasp
 and
 uh
 you
 know


started
 giving
 away
 all
 the
 bread
 I
 was


making
 and
 it
 found
 its
 way
 to
 a
 friend


of
 mine
 who
 worked
 at
 a
 local
 restaurant


and
 the
 owner
 called
 me
 out
 of
 the
 blue


and
 asked
 if
 I
 could
 make
 bread
 for
 him


daily
 and
 I
 said
 yes
 and
 it
 hasn't


stopped
 for
 10
 years.
 Wait,
 so
 initially


were
 you
 just
 baking
 bread
 at
 scale
 in


your
 kitchen?


>> I
 started
 as
 just
 for
 me,
 just
 as
 an


experiment.
 Um,
 but
 very
 quickly
 kind
 of


once
 I
 had
 that
 first
 account,
 which
 was


maybe
 6
 months
 after
 I
 started
 baking,
 6


months
 to
 a
 year,
 it
 the
 the
 attention


came
 quickly
 and
 I
 started
 needing
 to


level
 up
 over
 and
 over
 and
 over
 again.


So,
 the
 first
 place
 that
 I
 I
 would
 mix


the
 bread
 in
 my
 house
 and
 ferment
 it


there
 and
 then
 shape
 it
 and
 take
 it
 to
 a


pizza
 place
 around
 the
 corner
 and
 bake


it
 in
 their
 pizza
 oven.
 It
 was
 a
 variety


of
 these
 hacked
 together
 baking
 in
 other


bakeries
 off
 hours
 to
 get
 to
 get
 things


done.
 And
 as
 the
 the
 demand
 grew
 very


quickly,
 I
 I
 quickly
 had
 to
 figure
 out


how
 to
 run
 a
 business,
 not
 just
 bake
 a


few
 loaves
 of
 bread
 out
 of
 my
 house.
 um


and
 moved
 into
 a
 semi
 semi-legitimate


space
 at
 about
 a
 year
 and
 a
 half.


>> Flash
 forward
 to
 today,
 zooming
 out,
 why


don't
 you
 tell
 us
 about
 the
 size
 and


scope
 of
 your
 businesses?
 What
 do
 you


have
 right
 now
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 volume


and
 number
 of
 employees,
 stuff
 like


that?


>> The
 wholesale
 bakery,
 which
 is
 what
 that


story
 evolved
 into,
 is
 now
 a
 50
 person


business.
 We
 have
 a
 6,500
 foot
 facility


that
 produces
 bread,
 just
 bread,
 not


pastry,
 for
 about
 180
 restaurants
 in
 Los


Angeles.
 It's
 a
 pretty
 wide
 distribution


and
 we
 are
 still
 trying
 to
 grow.
 We're


kind
 of
 wallto-wall
 in
 that
 space
 and


need
 to
 move
 in
 the
 next
 two
 years.
 So,


we're
 starting
 to
 investigate
 what
 that


would
 look
 like.
 We
 also
 opened
 a
 retail


restaurant
 almost
 3
 years
 ago,
 which
 is


insane
 how
 quickly
 that
 3
 years
 has


passed
 um
 in
 our
 weird
 time
 vortex
 that


we
 live
 within
 now.
 And
 uh
 that
 is


another
 almost
 50
 person
 business
 um
 in


the
 Glassel
 Park
 neighborhood
 of
 Los


Angeles.
 We
 are
 in
 the
 process
 of


opening
 a
 pizza
 place
 in
 Highland
 Park,


a
 neighboring
 neighborhood.
 Um
 that
 will


be
 open
 hopefully
 in
 the
 next
 four
 to


five
 weeks.
 So
 that'll
 be
 another
 30


employees
 growing
 to
 50
 over
 time.


>> Why
 did
 you
 decide
 to
 do
 the
 uh
 the


retail
 sandwich
 shop?
 Because
 I
 imagine


wholesale
 actually
 sounds
 kind
 of
 nice


because
 you're
 still
 making
 a
 product


but
 you're
 divorced
 from
 uh
 face-to-face


interactions
 with
 customers
 which
 sounds


nice
 to
 me
 but
 obviously
 you
 have
 a


different
 opinion.


No,
 I
 don't.
 Um,


I
 mean,
 we
 started
 with
 wholesale.
 We


started
 in
 this
 less
 sexy,
 less


customer-f
 facing
 environment
 for
 the


first,
 say,
 5
 years
 of
 the
 business


before
 we,
 you
 know,
 changed
 gears
 to


open
 the
 retail
 restaurant.
 The


wholesale
 business
 is
 a
 much
 more
 steady


ship.
 I
 I
 sort
 of
 describe
 it
 as,
 you


know,
 you
 have
 this
 big
 ship.
 it
 it's


moving
 up
 and
 down
 in
 the
 in
 the
 water,


but
 ultimately
 is
 forward
 moving.
 Um,


it's
 harder
 to
 capsize.
 It's
 harder
 to


knock
 off
 course,
 and
 that
 makes
 it
 a


little
 bit,
 let's
 say,
 less
 crazy.
 The


restaurant
 business,
 which
 was
 what
 I


wanted
 to
 get
 into
 in
 the
 first
 place


had
 I
 known
 what
 it
 would
 be
 like
 uh
 at


the
 now
 that
 I'm
 there,
 you
 know,
 maybe


wholesale
 would
 have
 been
 better
 to
 stay


at,
 it's
 so
 much
 harder.
 It's
 much
 more


dynamic.
 Everything
 is
 changing
 all
 the


time.
 much
 more
 difficult
 to
 isolate
 the


variables.
 There's
 far
 more
 variables
 to


consider
 in
 the
 restaurant,
 especially


when
 you
 bring
 in
 customer
 customer


behaviors
 and
 how
 things
 really
 just


consistently
 fluctuate
 across
 the
 board.


[Music]


One
 of
 the
 themes
 that
 comes
 up
 in
 a


range
 of
 topics
 that
 we
 talk
 about
 is


distribution
 and
 actual
 like
 both


distribution
 in
 terms
 of
 sales
 but
 also


the
 physical
 distribution.
 How
 does
 it


work
 in
 Los
 Angeles?
 Do
 you
 have
 your


own
 vans?
 Are
 there
 third
 parties
 that


drop
 off
 the
 uh
 bread
 to
 the


restaurants?
 Like
 talk
 about
 how
 you


like
 built
 up
 that
 network
 and
 how
 the


bread
 physically
 gets
 from
 your


commercial
 bakery
 into
 the
 restaurants.


>> Sure.
 Yeah,
 we
 have
 currently
 we
 have


six
 vans
 that
 are
 either
 leased
 or
 owned


and
 it's
 been
 a
 bit
 of
 an
 excruciating


endeavor
 building
 out
 this
 whole
 network


because
 it
 is
 a
 major
 major
 part
 of
 what


we
 do
 especially
 because
 we're


wallto-wall.
 When
 I
 say
 wall
 to-
 wall,


it
 basically
 means
 there
 is
 literally
 no


more
 oven
 space
 per
 hour
 available
 for


for
 new
 loaves
 of
 bread
 to
 increase
 our


production.
 So,
 if
 you
 start
 baking
 at


2:30
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 you
 need
 to
 get


bread
 to
 all
 of
 these
 accounts
 before


they
 open
 at
 8:00
 a.m.,
 you
 have
 a
 very


narrow
 window
 to
 cool
 that
 bread,
 pack


that
 bread,
 get
 it
 into
 the
 vans,
 and


get
 it
 out
 to
 these
 uh
 accounts.
 So,
 our


ops
 team
 at
 the
 bakery
 are
 true
 geniuses


in
 building
 out
 these
 routes
 because
 you


have
 only
 have
 this
 very
 narrow
 gap
 to


hit.
 And
 if
 there's
 famous
 LA
 traffic
 or


anything
 else
 that
 uh
 gets
 backed
 up
 in


the
 baking
 process,
 you
 are
 scrambling


to
 try
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 take
 care


of
 these
 accounts
 in
 a
 way
 where
 they


can
 still
 do
 their
 jobs.
 So
 we
 have
 to


do
 our
 job
 not
 only
 just
 the
 baking
 job


but
 the
 distribution
 job
 before
 they


show
 up
 before
 anybody
 else
 uh
 from
 our


accounts
 show
 up
 to
 work.
 Also
 the
 vans


themselves
 are
 you
 know
 deeply


problematic.
 They
 are
 the
 number
 one


number
 one
 thing
 that
 breaks
 needs


service
 needs
 attention
 you
 know
 more


even
 more
 so
 than
 our
 ovens
 which
 are
 in


near
 constant
 use.
 And
 we
 have
 explored


a
 number
 of
 different
 options
 especially


for
 when
 we
 potentially
 move
 to
 a
 bigger


space
 about
 outsourcing
 our


distribution.
 Um
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of


upstart
 wholesale
 distribution
 companies


some
 of
 which
 are
 based
 in
 in
 LA
 a
 lot


more
 in
 San
 Francisco
 that
 are
 sort
 of


taking
 the
 Uber
 approach
 um
 and


outsourcing
 their
 drivers
 or
 having
 a


dedicated
 pool
 of
 drivers
 who
 work
 with


a
 variety
 of
 different
 accounts
 as


opposed
 to
 onetoone.
 So
 that
 you
 know


one
 of
 the
 major
 issues
 with
 our


business
 is
 the
 you
 know
 fluctuating


repair
 and
 maintenance
 numbers
 for
 our


vans.
 If
 we
 can
 offload
 that
 to
 someone


else,
 that
 is
 something
 that
 we
 have


certainly
 looked
 into.
 But
 when
 we
 get


into
 the
 mix
 with
 these
 conversations,


we
 always
 kind
 of
 end
 in
 the
 same
 place


where
 yes,
 we
 are
 not
 a
 con
 customer,


you
 know,
 a
 consumerf
 facing
 company,


but
 our
 business
 relies
 on
 that
 single


interaction
 between
 the
 chefs
 and
 our


drivers.
 They
 are
 our
 point
 of
 contact


with
 our
 customers.
 And
 if
 that
 is
 not


an
 authentic
 connection,
 if
 that
 is
 not


something
 our
 employees
 are
 connecting


with
 our
 customers,
 there's
 a
 potential


for
 things
 to
 go
 wrong
 and
 a
 potential


for
 that
 relationship
 to
 be
 soured.
 So


we've
 ultimately
 stuck
 with
 our
 own


employees
 and
 our
 own
 vans
 for
 now.


>> Tracy,
 I'm
 just
 thinking
 about
 how
 crazy


it
 must
 be
 to
 like
 have
 an
 interest
 in


bread
 such
 as
 yourself
 and
 then
 suddenly


like
 you're
 in
 the
 brake
 pad


>> become
 a
 mechanic.


>> No,
 you're
 at
 the
 break
 of
 repair


business
 too
 and
 you
 got
 to
 take
 that


into
 account.
 No,
 I
 was
 thinking
 the


same
 thing.
 And
 it's
 something
 that
 I


guess
 when
 people
 envision
 a
 bakery,
 you


don't
 necessarily
 think
 about
 the
 uh


transportation
 and
 delivery
 aspect
 of


it.
 But
 Andy,
 you
 mentioned
 2:30
 a.m.


just
 then
 and
 the
 narrow
 window
 for


delivery.
 And
 I
 have
 to
 ask,


>> what's
 it
 like
 getting
 actual
 workers
 in


the
 door
 who
 uh
 who
 want
 to,
 I
 guess,


wake
 up
 at
 like
 1:00
 a.m.
 in
 the
 morning


and
 go
 bake
 bread?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 uh
 it's
 tricky.
 you
 know,
 you


first
 of
 all,
 you
 have
 to
 love
 it.
 Um,


you
 have
 to
 love
 the
 process.
 And
 I


mean,
 the
 230
 aspect
 is
 is,
 you
 know,


very
 very
 early
 and
 a
 very
 very


different
 lifestyle.
 Um,
 in
 a
 in
 a


literal
 way,
 you
 are
 falling
 asleep
 at


5:30
 p.m.
 And
 that
 means
 that
 your,
 you


know,
 connection
 with
 your
 family,
 your


connection
 with
 your
 friends,
 you're


operating
 on
 a
 completely
 different
 time


zone
 than
 they
 are.
 And
 it
 makes
 things


complicated
 if
 folks
 are
 not
 operating


on
 the
 same
 schedule
 as
 you.
 But
 you


know
 the


it's
 I
 that
 was
 the
 last
 baking
 shift


that
 I
 that
 I
 did
 was
 the
 Sunday
 morning


2:30
 a.m.
 bake
 for
 the
 Hollywood
 Farmers


Market.
 I
 would,
 you
 know,
 get
 up
 at
 2,


roll
 down
 to
 the
 bakery.
 It
 would
 be


just
 me
 in
 the
 dark.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


returning
 from
 their
 various
 parties
 on


Saturday
 night.
 Um,
 which
 made
 driving


there
 a
 little
 bit
 sketchy,
 but
 always,


you
 know,
 being
 careful.
 and
 then,
 you


know,
 finish
 the
 bake,
 pack
 it
 up,
 put


it
 in
 my
 truck,
 and
 go
 to
 the
 farmers


market
 and
 and
 sell
 it.
 Um,
 and
 then
 the


day
 would
 wrap
 up
 around
 2:30.
 So,
 it


would
 be
 this
 12-h
 hour
 kind
 of
 sprint


and
 then
 sale
 and
 then
 come
 back.
 And,


you
 know,
 at
 a
 certain
 point,
 it
 was
 the


only
 bake
 shift
 that
 I
 was
 doing
 because


I
 had
 to
 manage
 the
 business
 during
 the


other
 days
 of
 the
 week
 that
 I
 was
 not


doing
 that.
 And
 when
 you
 just
 bake
 one


day
 a
 week
 at
 2:30
 in
 the
 morning,
 it


scramles
 your
 mind
 so
 wildly.
 and
 your


sleep
 schedule
 that
 I
 had
 to
 eventually


abandon
 it
 just
 because
 I
 needed
 more


time
 to
 manage
 the
 businesses.
 But
 you


really
 have
 to
 subscribe
 to
 the


lifestyle.
 If
 you
 try
 and
 push
 the
 edge,


you
 know,
 especially
 when
 I
 was
 baking


and
 managing
 five
 days,
 baking
 5
 days
 a


week
 and
 still
 trying
 to
 manage
 the


business
 was
 getting
 sick
 a
 lot.
 It
 was


very
 difficult
 to
 stay
 healthy
 when


you're
 operating
 across
 two,
 you
 know,


time
 zones
 really.
 you're
 you're
 living


in
 this
 kind
 of
 uh
 oh
 my
 wife
 and
 my


friends
 are
 all
 living
 in
 this
 time
 zone


and
 my
 business
 is
 living
 in
 this
 time


zone
 and
 I
 need
 both
 I
 need
 to
 be
 there


for
 both
 those
 were
 were
 far
 more


complicated
 times
 for
 my
 own
 health.
 Uh


but
 we're
 on
 the
 other
 side
 of
 that
 now.


We
 mentioned
 in
 the
 beginning
 um
 you


know
 we
 like
 this
 topic
 because
 it's


sort
 of
 a
 lens
 into
 everything
 but
 what


are
 you
 seeing
 today
 in
 terms
 of
 you


know
 if
 you
 compare
 now
 to
 when
 you


started
 how
 do
 think
 or
 versus
 the
 peak


of
 the
 inflation
 whatever
 it
 was
 how
 do


things
 look
 today
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 both


hiring
 availability
 and
 also
 um
 raw


commodity
 cost
 ingredient
 costs


>> hiring
 availability
 is
 unique
 for
 us
 uh


obviously
 we
 are
 looking
 for
 a
 very


specialized
 group
 of
 people.
 So
 the


skills
 that
 they
 hopefully
 already
 have


are
 in
 in
 rare
 supply
 in
 Los
 Angeles
 and


uh
 that
 makes
 hiring
 complicated
 far


more
 so
 for
 the
 wholesale
 bakery
 than


for
 the
 restaurant.
 The
 restaurant
 has
 a


lot
 of
 over
 the
 pool
 is
 much
 wider
 and


we
 have
 very
 little
 trouble
 hiring
 at


the
 restaurant.
 um
 the
 bakery.


>> Real
 quickly,
 is
 that
 would
 you
 have


said
 this
 same
 thing
 in
 2022
 or
 2023
 or


does
 it
 feel
 easier
 today
 than
 it
 would


have
 back
 then
 at
 the
 at
 the
 retail


level?
 Because
 that's
 where
 that's
 where


like
 all
 the
 complaints
 were,
 right?


Everyone
 all
 the
 restaurants
 and
 service


entities
 were
 complaining
 about
 how


impossible
 it
 was.


>> I
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 I
 think
 that
 it's


impossible
 if
 you
 don't
 already
 have
 a


name
 um
 that
 people
 know.
 Um,
 and
 I


think
 for
 us,
 we've
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 our


efforts
 making
 sure
 that
 our
 employees


are
 well
 taken
 care
 of
 and
 supported
 and


treated
 like
 the
 human
 beings
 that
 they


are.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 that
 when
 we
 open


the
 restaurant
 after
 the
 bakery,
 that


was
 already
 somewhat
 established
 in
 the


in
 the
 public
 eye.
 So,
 um,
 that
 helps
 us


to
 kind
 of
 make
 this
 play.
 I
 I
 mean
 this


is
 the
 the
 point
 of
 it
 all
 is
 we
 want
 to


make
 this
 a
 desirable
 place
 uh
 for
 for


people
 to
 work
 so
 that
 when
 they
 come


here
 they
 have
 a
 good
 time,
 they're
 well


supported,
 they
 get
 fed,
 they
 get


treated
 well,
 they
 have
 healthcare
 and


you
 know
 we
 um
 really
 built
 this
 thing


on
 that.
 um
 it's
 becoming
 harder
 and


harder
 to
 have
 a
 functional
 business


including
 all
 of
 those
 things
 which
 is


you
 know
 the
 real
 issue
 at
 hand
 here
 is


that
 the
 expenses
 are
 enumerating
 and


the
 um
 you
 know
 sales
 remain
 the
 same.


Um,
 so
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 raw
 materials,


there's
 been
 there's
 we're
 actually
 in
 a


much
 better
 place
 than
 we
 were
 say
 a


year
 ago
 or
 even
 a
 year
 before
 that.
 The


the
 bakery
 goes
 by
 one
 ingredient.
 It's


flour.
 Flour
 flour
 is
 wheat
 and
 wheat
 is


uh,
 you
 know,
 a
 global
 commodity
 that


has
 uh
 a
 lot
 of
 fluctuations.
 It's


usually
 compared
 to
 others
 fairly


steady.
 But
 for
 example,
 when
 the
 Russia


Ukraine
 war
 broke
 out
 there
 uh
 Russia


was
 not
 allowing
 Ukraine's
 wheat
 to


leave
 the
 country,
 Ukraine
 is
 the
 sort


of
 bread
 basket
 provider
 of
 wheat
 for


Europe.
 And
 when
 that
 happens,
 there's


much
 more
 demand
 coming
 from
 the
 United


States.
 Prices
 go
 up
 and
 the
 American


users
 of
 American
 wheat
 are
 the
 ones
 who


end
 up
 paying
 more
 so
 that
 those


products
 end
 up
 in
 Europe
 to
 cover
 for


the
 loss
 of
 supply.
 Um,
 so
 we
 saw
 maybe


a
 10
 10%
 increase
 in
 flower
 pricing.
 It


caused
 us
 to
 have
 to
 drive
 our
 prices
 up


for
 the
 first
 time
 uh
 in
 a
 long
 time


bread-wise.
 Um
 uh
 now
 it
 has
 settled


back
 down.
 Uh
 but
 in
 the
 meantime,


everything
 else
 has
 gotten
 more


expensive.
 And
 you
 know,
 there's
 there's


a
 um
 you
 know,
 massive
 wave
 of


restaurant
 closures
 in
 Los
 Angeles
 right


now,
 including
 yesterday
 Kohl's,


117year-old
 restaurant,
 announced
 that


it's
 closing.
 The
 Pantry,
 which
 has
 been


around
 for
 100
 years,
 closed.
 It's
 a


very,
 very,
 very,
 very
 difficult
 time


for
 restaurants
 to
 thrive,
 let
 you
 know,


survive,
 let
 alone
 thrive
 in
 in
 this


town.
 So,
 um
 interesting
 times
 for
 sure.


[Music]


Just
 on
 the
 commodities
 front,
 how
 does


it
 work
 in
 terms
 of
 actually
 sourcing


things
 like
 flour?
 Do
 you
 sign,
 you


know,
 forward
 agreements
 with
 suppliers


um
 at
 a
 certain
 price?
 And
 I
 I
 guess


like
 how
 long-term
 are
 those
 prices
 set?


Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 um
 depends
 very
 much
 on


volume
 and
 we
 are
 in
 this
 very
 unique


sort
 of
 middle
 ground
 where
 we
 are
 not
 a


giant
 25,000
 foot
 bakery
 and
 we
 are
 not


one
 of
 the
 sort
 of
 more
 retail
 oriented


2,000
 ft²
 bakeries.
 We
 are
 in
 the
 middle


looking
 to
 make
 this
 leap
 to
 where
 we


can
 buy
 directly
 from
 our
 purveyors
 and


when
 we
 can
 like
 purveyors
 as
 in


non-distributors
 directly
 from
 King


Arthur
 directly
 from
 Cameas
 Country
 Mill


directly
 from
 you
 know
 a
 variety
 of


other
 flower
 purveyors
 and
 when
 we
 can


do
 those
 types
 of
 things
 and
 buy
 at


scale
 say
 17
 to
 20
 pallets
 of
 flour
 at
 a


time
 we
 can
 lock
 in
 forward
 pricing
 with


King
 Arthur
 with
 some
 of
 the
 other
 ones


but
 in
 in
 the
 moment
 now
 where
 we're


operating
 through
 distributors
 we
 are


subject
 to
 their
 markup
 and
 They
 they


are
 fluctuating
 what
 they're
 doing
 based


on
 whatever
 algorithms
 they're
 they're


using
 to
 calculate
 proper
 pricing
 not


only
 just
 from
 what
 they're
 getting


charged
 from
 the
 you
 know
 the
 actual


producer
 but
 also
 um
 however
 their


business
 is
 doing
 and
 whatever
 you
 know


markup
 they
 need
 to
 to
 include.
 So
 what


we
 do
 in
 that
 circumstance
 and
 what
 most


restaurants
 do
 is
 regularly
 pit


distributors
 against
 each
 other
 for
 our


business
 especially
 because
 we
 have
 a


lot
 of
 leverage
 with
 our
 flower
 orders.


it's
 it's
 a
 fairly
 significant
 regular


order.
 So
 even
 if
 they're
 making
 a
 very


small
 amount
 on
 that
 uh
 on
 each
 bag


there
 there's
 a
 large
 volume
 and
 a
 large


frequency
 that
 has
 those
 purveyors
 kind


of
 jockeying
 for
 the
 lower
 price
 and


that's
 there's
 no
 service
 there's
 no


anything
 else
 that
 that
 really
 matters


in
 that
 relationship.
 It's
 just
 if
 you


can
 get
 us
 the
 price
 we
 will
 order
 from


you
 this
 week
 and
 and
 they
 know
 that
 and


they
 fight


>> and
 it's
 a
 weekly
 price.
 Uh
 it's
 it's


more
 frequent
 than
 week
 weekly
 at
 the


moment.
 There's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 flux.


June
 June
 uh
 you
 know
 and
 I've
 just
 have


regular
 conversations
 with
 King
 Arthur


who's
 our
 main
 bread
 flour
 supplier


>> um
 who
 are
 one
 of
 the
 most
 wonderful


businesses
 in
 the
 country
 and
 just
 good


people
 and
 and
 always
 you
 know
 driven
 to


to
 help
 their
 uh
 clients.
 um
 they
 always


are
 monitoring
 you
 know
 the
 commodity


future
 futures
 and
 how
 things
 are


looking
 going
 forward
 and
 I
 will


sometimes
 reach
 out
 to
 them
 to
 find
 out


you
 know
 how
 how
 they
 are
 pricing
 things


relative
 to
 who
 they're
 selling
 to
 the


distributors
 so
 that
 I
 can
 see
 if
 the


the
 increases
 in
 price
 are
 coming
 via


the
 distributor
 or
 via
 King
 Arthur
 and


then
 I'll
 know
 whether
 I
 have
 some


leverage
 to
 kind
 of
 push
 down
 a
 little


bit
 further
 to
 try
 and
 fight
 for
 cheaper


But
 there
 was
 a
 big
 spike.
 You
 know,


things
 have
 been
 trending
 downward
 in
 in


price
 that
 that
 uh
 the
 war,
 you
 know,


the
 embargo
 opened
 up
 or
 whatever
 it
 was


that
 opened
 up
 and
 allowed
 the
 wheat
 to


leave
 Ukraine.
 So
 prices
 in
 the
 states


settled
 back
 down
 because
 there's
 less


exports.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 a
 um,
 you
 know,


something
 that
 if
 you're
 constantly


monitoring
 it
 um,
 is
 changing
 very
 often


um,
 in
 in
 minor
 increments,
 but
 if
 you


do
 that
 across
 an
 entire
 batch
 of
 mil


wheat,
 that's
 that's
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 dollars.


>> So,
 how
 does
 that
 actually
 feed
 into


your
 prices
 for
 bread?
 Like,
 and
 how


dynamic
 are
 they?
 If
 you
 get
 a
 price


increase
 um,
 one
 day,
 do
 you
 immediately


pass
 that
 through
 to
 the
 customer?


>> Almost
 never.
 Um
 and
 that
 that's
 you


know
 the
 the
 increases
 and
 decreases
 are


uh
 fairly
 minor
 at
 the
 moment.
 They
 are


in
 flux
 but
 they
 are
 staying
 in
 the


general
 vicinity.
 You
 know
 if
 we're


talking
 specifics
 we're
 talking
 about


somewhere
 between
 15
 and
 1750
 for
 150
 lb


bag
 of
 bread
 flour.
 And
 that
 fluctuation


it
 stays
 in
 that
 zone.
 Maybe
 a
 year
 ago


it
 was
 up
 at
 23.
 And
 if
 you
 think
 about


that,
 if
 we're
 ordering,
 let's
 say,


5,000
 pounds
 a
 week
 of
 flour,
 it's


actually
 more
 than
 that.
 I
 think
 it's


closer
 to
 6,500
 pounds
 and
 we're
 talking


about
 a
 fluctuation
 of
 a
 dollar.
 That
 is


a
 massive
 change
 in
 our
 endofear,
 you


know,
 bottom
 line.
 So,
 it's
 it's
 the


kind
 of
 thing
 where
 if
 there
 are
 any


changes
 whatsoever
 within
 that
 zone,


they're
 multiplied
 over
 a
 large
 number


of
 bags
 and
 end
 up
 changing
 things


fairly
 significantly.
 So,
 we
 really
 have


to
 even
 if
 it's
 within
 that
 15
 to
 17


range
 as
 opposed
 to
 going
 all
 the
 way
 up


to
 $23
 a
 bag,
 that
 is
 um
 it's
 crucial


for
 us
 to
 stay
 on
 top
 of
 it.
 But
 in


terms
 of
 passing
 the
 pricing
 on,
 we've


given
 ourselves
 a
 pretty
 wide
 range
 to


stay
 within
 that
 makes
 our
 pricing
 valid


and
 we're
 constantly
 staying
 on
 top
 of


it.
 But
 bread
 in
 general,
 the
 food
 cost


is
 not
 the
 main
 issue
 unless
 you're


talking
 about
 a
 jump
 from
 $15
 a
 bag
 to


$23
 a
 bag.
 The
 main
 issue
 is
 labor


because
 cogs
 typically
 with
 bread
 are
 in


the,
 you
 know,
 10
 to
 15%
 range,
 which
 is


the
 cheapest
 food
 product
 you
 can


possibly
 make,
 even
 if
 you're
 using
 like


really
 fantastic
 ingredients
 like
 we


are.
 The
 thing
 is
 is
 it
 just
 takes
 a
 lot


of
 human
 beings
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 skilled


human
 beings
 to
 execute
 production.
 So


if
 we're
 talking
 about
 the
 traditional


model
 where
 you
 see
 like
 30%
 for
 labor,


we're
 looking
 at
 more
 42%
 for
 labor
 and


12%
 for
 COGS
 where
 COGS
 typically
 in
 a


restaurant
 food
 business
 environment
 is


somewhere
 to
 25
 to
 30
 if
 you're
 doing


okay.
 We're
 at
 14.
 So
 they
 the
 model
 is


a
 little
 bit
 different
 in
 the
 wholesale


universe
 than
 it
 is
 in
 the
 retail


restaurant.
 and
 that
 that
 is
 uh
 you
 know


we're
 able
 to
 have
 those
 extra
 bodies
 to


get
 things
 done
 because
 the
 cost
 of


goods
 are
 so
 low.


>> This
 is
 fascinating.
 Let's
 continue
 on


this.
 You're
 talking
 about
 your


wholesale
 distribution
 bakery
 when


you're
 talking
 about
 the
 restaurant.
 How


do
 you
 think
 that
 generally
 about
 the


strategy
 of
 price
 increases
 because


obviously
 you
 know
 you're
 not
 going
 to


be
 sensitive
 to
 the
 day-to-day
 or
 the


monthtomonth.
 My
 guess
 is
 many
 most


companies
 want
 to
 pass
 some
 sort
 of


price
 increase
 on
 on
 a
 semi-regular


basis
 maybe
 once
 a
 year
 or
 something
 but


generally
 like
 talk
 about
 like
 how


frequently
 you
 make
 those
 decisions
 to


incre
 increase
 prices
 and
 when.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 would
 say
 that
 we
 are
 less
 uh


on
 on
 a
 schedule
 than
 is
 typical
 for
 a


larger
 bakery.
 I
 think
 when
 you
 get
 to


scale
 like
 us
 or
 larger,
 there's
 an


inclination
 just
 from
 oper
 the


operations
 side
 of
 things
 to
 make
 these


these
 changes
 regular.
 And
 for
 us,
 it's


more
 about
 making
 sure
 that
 our
 accounts


are
 getting
 what
 they
 expect
 and
 are
 not


being
 pushed
 further
 when
 it's
 no
 real


issue
 for
 us
 relative
 to
 COGS
 to
 float
 a


little
 bit
 of
 that
 within
 a
 range.
 It's


also
 even
 more
 relevant
 to
 monitor
 our


competitors
 pricing.
 Our
 products
 are


not
 entirely
 apples
 to
 apples
 talking


about
 two
 different
 basic
 what
 we
 call
 a


house
 loaf
 but
 most
 places
 call
 a


country
 loaf
 basic
 sourdough
 loaf
 of


bread
 which
 I
 you
 know
 we
 charge
 $6
 for


wholesale
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 places


might
 charge
 $750
 but
 their
 loaf
 is
 250


grams
 heavier
 than
 ours
 or
 some
 other


difference.
 So
 it's
 difficult
 to
 track


but
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 the
 bottom
 line
 is


for
 our
 customers
 we
 have
 to
 stay
 within


a
 range.
 Um
 we
 are
 a
 higherend
 wholesale


product
 which
 makes
 us
 unique
 as
 well.


Uh
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 that
 doesn't


mean
 that
 we're
 not
 competing
 with
 those


who
 are
 making
 some
 more
 you
 know
 sort


of
 commercially
 mechanized
 loaves
 of


bread.
 So
 we
 have
 to
 be
 very
 mindful
 of


our
 competitors
 prices.
 And
 I
 would
 say


that
 reality
 mixed
 with
 some
 of
 the


increases
 in
 hogs
 are
 what
 drive
 our


price
 increases.
 I'd
 say
 we've
 raised


prices
 maybe


twice
 in
 the
 last
 four
 years.
 You
 know,


I
 think
 we
 we
 had
 no
 choice
 when
 bags


were
 all
 the
 way
 up
 at
 $8
 more
 per
 than


they
 are
 now.
 And
 by
 the
 time
 we
 were


able
 to
 bring
 that
 price
 back
 down,


which
 I
 think
 I
 would
 say,
 you
 know,
 was


around
 May
 of
 this
 year.
 So,
 it's
 a


really
 long
 time
 of
 these
 elevated


prices.
 Other
 expenses
 like
 labor
 and


outside
 things
 are
 have
 increased
 to
 the


point
 where
 we
 can't
 lower
 the
 prices


back
 down.
 It's
 just
 the
 way
 that
 it


goes.
 As
 much
 as
 I'd
 like
 to
 because
 I
 I


I
 feel
 the
 benefit
 very,
 you
 know,
 I


feel
 the
 benefit
 from
 passing
 savings


off
 to
 the
 to
 our
 accounts,
 but
 at
 a


certain
 a
 certain
 point,
 you
 have
 to


protect
 the
 business,
 and
 that's
 that's


where
 we're
 at.
 So
 I
 mentioned
 at
 the


beginning
 that
 you're
 in
 the
 process
 of


opening
 a
 pizzeria.
 So
 congratulations


on
 that
 on
 the
 expansion.


>> But
 one
 thing
 we
 hear
 a
 lot
 about


nowadays
 is
 the
 idea
 of
 you
 know


regulation
 slowing
 down
 businesses.
 And


there
 seems
 to
 be
 certainly
 a
 dereg
 bent


in
 the
 Trump
 administration
 and
 a


general
 sense
 that
 all
 these
 rules
 and


bureaucracy
 really
 slow
 things
 down.
 And


so
 I'm
 curious,
 what's
 the
 process
 been


like
 for
 you
 in
 opening
 the
 pizza


restaurant?
 How
 long
 have
 you
 been
 doing


it?
 And
 I
 guess
 how
 much
 paperwork
 have


you
 actually
 had
 to
 do?


>> Well,
 Los
 Angeles
 in
 within
 the


restaurant
 world
 is
 fairly
 famous
 for


the
 ineptitude
 of
 its
 governmental


oversight
 agencies.
 We
 have
 to
 sort
 of


deal
 with
 both
 the
 county
 and
 the
 city.


There's
 building
 and
 safety
 and
 the


health
 department.
 They
 don't
 talk
 to


each
 other,
 but
 you're
 they're
 both
 kind


of
 looking
 at
 the
 same
 thing,
 and
 they


both
 point
 you
 in
 different
 directions,


and
 it
 gets
 very
 complicated
 when
 the


inspectors
 start
 showing
 up,
 which
 is


throughout
 the
 process.
 The
 thing
 about


the
 pizza
 place
 is
 that
 it
 was
 a
 second


gen
 space.
 It
 was
 already
 a
 pizzeria.


That
 said,
 we're,
 you
 know,
 stripping


out
 all
 the
 equipment
 and
 rebuilding
 it.


But
 that
 makes
 the
 process
 significantly


faster.
 And
 if
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't
 want


to
 say
 anything
 uh
 or
 be
 an
 absolutist


in
 any
 way,
 but
 I
 will
 never
 do
 a
 firstg


space
 ever
 again.
 Um
 because
 it's
 just


excruciating.
 And
 you
 know,
 when
 we


opened
 the
 restaurant,
 we
 signed
 our


lease
 in
 November
 of
 2019.
 So
 taking
 you


know,
 obviously
 there's
 a
 pandemic
 to


consider,
 but
 it
 took
 us
 three
 years
 to


open.
 A
 lot
 of
 that
 was
 due
 to
 problems


with
 the
 city.
 You
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is


very
 analog.
 they
 print
 up
 your


application
 and
 it
 sits
 on
 a
 literal


stack
 on
 someone's
 desk
 and
 if
 you
 don't


follow
 up
 with
 them
 incessantly
 that


stack
 just
 gets
 piled
 on
 top
 and
 your


thing
 just
 disappears
 deep
 into
 the
 uh


you
 know
 into
 the
 pile.
 So
 it's
 it's
 a


very
 very
 very
 difficult
 process.
 Do
 I


think
 the
 exact
 opposite
 just
 stripping


down
 things
 to
 nothing
 is
 the
 is
 the
 uh


answer?
 Definitely
 not.
 But
 you
 know
 LA


has
 a
 lot
 of
 red
 tape
 to
 navigate.
 It


also
 is
 expensive
 red
 tape
 to
 navigate.


Um,
 so
 you're
 paying
 a
 ton
 for,
 you


know,
 sort
 of
 non-service
 and
 making


things
 really
 complicated
 for
 you.
 You


can
 get
 to
 the
 very
 very
 end
 of
 the


finish
 line
 and
 you're
 you're
 ready
 to


open
 and
 the
 health
 inspector
 walks
 in


on
 the
 last
 day
 and
 says,
 "This
 floor


drain
 is
 not
 in
 the
 right
 place
 based
 on


the
 plans
 that
 they
 approved
 and
 you


know,
 eight
 months
 ago
 from
 somebody


else."
 Uh,
 and
 then
 you
 have
 no
 choice


but
 to
 spend
 an
 extra
 $8,000


rerouting
 your
 plumbing
 and
 then
 getting


plumbing
 inspection
 again.


>> It
 sounds
 like
 you're
 speaking
 from


personal
 experience
 on
 that
 one.
 That's


a
 very
 specific
 example.


>> Well,
 no.
 I
 mean,
 uh,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 I


looked
 at
 Kohl's
 uh,
 the
 restaurant
 you


mentioned
 and
 I'm
 reading
 the
 article


and
 it
 talked
 the
 quote
 litany
 of


reasons
 for
 it
 closing,
 pandemic,
 actor


and
 writer
 strike,
 crime,
 labor
 costs,


bureaucracy,
 etc.
 But
 just
 on
 this


point,
 like
 I
 have
 never
 worked
 in
 a
 um


actually
 I
 did
 work
 in
 well
 actually


I've
 worked


>> you
 worked
 at
 the
 sandwich
 shop


>> and
 I
 and
 I
 worked
 in
 a
 Nigerian


restaurant
 in
 uh
 college
 which
 I
 never


talk
 about
 but
 is
 it
 like
 the
 bear


basically
 that's
 all
 cuz
 when
 people


hear
 all
 of
 this
 stuff
 about
 like
 oh
 you


got
 to
 move
 the
 drain.
 What
 was
 there


was
 like
 something
 with
 a
 balloon
 or


something
 like
 that?
 I
 don't
 remember


the
 exact
 scene
 but
 is
 it
 like
 that


stressful
 where
 like
 you
 know
 they
 come


in
 and
 everyone's
 like
 on
 baited
 breath


about
 whether
 they
 see
 something
 or
 not


before
 you
 can
 open
 the
 door.
 100%
 100%.


The
 the
 the
 fear
 that
 is
 struck
 into
 the


hearts
 of
 restaurant
 managers
 when
 uh


someone
 with
 a
 hanging
 neck
 tag
 comes
 in


from
 the
 city
 is
 overwhelming.
 the


messages
 on
 Slack
 go
 immediately
 out
 and


everyone
 springs
 into
 gear
 because
 a
 lot


of
 the
 things
 that
 they
 require
 are
 not


logical,
 don't
 make
 sense,
 are
 there
 for


the
 purposes
 of
 checking
 some
 ridiculous


box
 from
 1965
 that
 isn't
 applicable


anymore,
 but
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 make
 the


effort
 to
 change
 things
 with
 the
 state


government
 or
 the
 county
 government.
 and


you
 just
 kind
 of
 get
 locked
 into,


you
 know,
 for
 for
 someone
 who
 is
 so


focused
 on
 logic
 and
 the
 logical


approach
 to
 things
 and
 really
 reasoning


things
 out
 and
 finding
 out
 the
 best
 way


forward,
 it's
 just
 in
 excruciatingly


frustrating
 to
 be
 put
 in
 this
 position


where
 nothing
 is
 logical.
 And
 the


decisions
 of
 this
 individual
 largely


have
 to
 do
 with
 their
 mood
 that
 day
 or


whether
 they
 don't
 whether
 they
 like


your
 place
 or
 whether
 they
 like
 you
 or


whatever
 is
 going
 on.
 it
 could
 be


motivated
 not
 by
 anything
 on
 paper
 but


more
 about
 this
 sort
 of
 unknowable


nuance.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 excruciatingly


frustrating.
 There
 are,
 you
 know,
 known


inspectors
 that
 people
 fear.
 There
 are


known
 inspectors
 that
 people
 hope
 for


and
 you
 never
 know
 what
 you're
 going
 to


get.
 There's
 I
 I
 heard
 stories
 of
 so
 a


lot
 of
 architecture
 companies
 have
 sort


of
 sprung
 out
 into
 become
 expediters
 as


well.
 So
 they
 basically
 are
 will
 take


all
 of
 your
 paperwork
 and
 the
 ridiculous


amount
 of
 stuff
 that
 you
 need
 to
 do.
 You


pay
 them
 a
 fixed
 fee
 and
 they're
 the


ones
 who
 not
 only
 well
 if
 they're


architects
 design
 the
 restaurant
 but


then
 we'll
 run
 everything
 through
 all


the
 necessary
 channels
 with
 the
 city
 and


the
 county
 um
 and
 the
 state
 and
 that


costs
 an
 incredible
 amount.
 So
 that's


another
 thing
 that
 gets
 you
 know
 piled


on
 top
 but
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 do
 that


anymore
 because
 it's
 so
 ludicrous
 that


it
 just
 makes
 your
 you
 go
 crazy.
 I
 hear


I
 have
 no
 experience
 outside
 of
 Los


Angeles
 that
 this
 this
 infrastructure
 is


one
 of
 the
 the
 worst
 out
 there.


>> So
 Joe
 uh
 listed
 a
 bunch
 of
 reasons
 that


a
 restaurant
 might
 close
 earlier,
 but
 I


would
 love
 to
 get
 your
 take
 on
 what


exactly
 is
 causing
 restaurants
 to
 go
 out


of
 business
 in
 LA.
 And
 also
 one
 thing


I've
 always
 wondered
 about,
 why
 do


people
 still
 open
 restaurants?
 Because


the
 thing
 you
 hear
 is
 always
 that
 like


it's
 a
 tiny
 tiny
 margin.
 It's
 really


difficult.
 It's
 really
 competitive.
 You


have
 to
 basically
 give
 your
 entire
 life


over
 to
 this
 endeavor.
 It
 sounds
 like
 a


hard
 job,
 but
 new
 restaurants
 open
 all


the
 time.


>> It's
 true.
 I
 think
 I'd
 say
 that
 the


motivation
 to
 open
 most
 restaurants
 is
 a


flawed
 motivation.
 It's
 usually
 based
 on


ego
 or
 showing
 off
 cash
 or
 trying
 to


acquire
 digital
 fame,
 other
 things
 that


will
 inevitably
 either
 lead
 to
 a
 short


burst
 of
 success
 followed
 by
 an


immediate
 decline
 or
 just
 an
 immediate


uh
 misfire.
 Um,
 and
 that's
 why
 most


restaurants
 close
 in
 the
 first
 year


because
 it's
 excruciatingly
 difficult
 to


do
 this.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 the
 general


view
 is
 that
 working
 in
 a
 restaurant
 is


easy.
 It's
 a
 copout
 from
 some
 more


corporate
 approach
 to
 living
 and
 it's


just
 not.
 It's
 so
 much
 less
 manageable.


It's
 so
 much
 wilder
 than
 you
 know
 a
 more


corporate
 career
 that
 it
 makes
 it
 very


very
 hard
 to
 do.
 But
 there
 is,
 to
 answer


your
 question,
 incredible
 joy
 in


interfacing
 with
 people
 and
 making
 them


happy
 and
 being
 connected
 to
 hospitality


and
 the
 pleasure
 of
 taking
 care
 of


people
 and
 giving
 them
 something
 that


they
 get
 to
 do,
 you
 know,
 three
 times
 a


day,
 but
 making
 it
 something
 that
 brings


them
 joy.
 You
 can
 see
 that
 and
 that


reverberates
 back
 to
 you
 in
 a
 way
 that


feels
 far
 more
 authentic
 than
 it
 felt


when
 I
 was
 writing
 and
 producing


commercials
 trying
 to
 manipulate
 people


into
 buying
 It's
 about
 that


authentic
 connection
 and
 I
 don't
 want
 to


have
 to
 feel
 bad
 for
 what
 I
 do
 for
 the


rest
 of
 my
 life.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 to


feel
 bad
 about
 it.
 And
 I
 did
 that
 for


for
 almost
 a
 decade.
 And
 I
 think
 that


this
 provides
 a
 a
 authentic
 reality
 for


me
 and
 the
 people
 that
 work
 here
 despite


all
 of
 the
 challenges
 of
 doing
 it.
 And
 I


think
 the
 challenges
 are
 in
 place


because
 the
 challenges
 are
 are
 always
 in


place
 when
 you're
 trying
 to
 do
 something


that's
 authentic
 and
 aside
 from
 the


general
 flow
 of
 our
 sort
 of
 controlled


existence
 that
 we
 have
 right
 now.


>> You
 you
 mentioned
 digital
 fame
 at
 your


uh
 at
 the
 pizzeria
 at
 the
 restaurant.
 Do


you
 feel
 like
 the
 need
 to
 have
 your


equivalent
 of
 like,
 you
 know,
 the
 viral


arrowan
 smoothie
 like
 something
 like
 is


that
 an
 important
 thing
 you
 think
 about


that
 this
 is
 a
 thing
 that
 could
 blow
 up


on
 TikTok
 or
 whatever
 it
 is?


>> No.
 No.
 But
 I'm
 I'm
 unique
 in
 that
 way.


I
 can't
 wait
 to
 remove
 us
 from
 social


media.
 That
 is
 a
 intractable
 connection.


Here's
 how
 I
 think
 about
 it
 now.
 where


the
 restaurant
 and
 the
 bakery
 are


established.
 Generally,
 people
 in
 Los


Angeles
 know
 to
 some
 degree
 or
 people


who
 are
 involved
 in
 food
 know
 who
 we


are.
 If
 I
 were
 to
 seek
 new
 customers
 in


this
 moment
 for
 our
 retail
 restaurant,


they
 would
 be
 inauthentic
 connections


with
 what
 we
 do.
 They
 might
 resonate


with
 some
 with
 our
 BLT
 that
 we
 just
 put


out
 first
 when
 the
 tomatoes
 are
 good
 now


in
 the
 summer
 and
 they
 might
 come
 to
 the


restaurant
 on
 the
 weekend,
 but


ultimately
 our
 bread
 and
 butter
 is
 going


to
 be
 our
 regular
 return
 customers
 who


have
 a
 relationship
 at
 the
 restaurant


and
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 ostracize
 them


because
 they're
 the
 people
 who
 are
 going


to
 keep
 us
 here
 for
 a
 decade
 as
 opposed


to
 the
 people
 who
 are
 going
 to
 make
 us


famous
 in
 the
 moment,
 drive
 out
 our


regular
 customers
 and
 then
 move
 on
 to


the
 next
 trendy
 thing.
 So
 for
 us,
 trends


are
 are
 a
 business
 killer.
 You
 can
 get


short
 short
 success
 from
 a
 trend,
 but
 if


you
 want
 to
 be
 here
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and


build
 a
 customer
 base
 that's
 dedicated,


you
 have
 to
 have
 an
 authentic


relationship
 with
 those
 people.
 And
 that


has
 to
 mean
 that
 whatever
 your
 product


is,
 they
 are
 authentically
 connecting


with
 it
 because
 of
 their
 own
 desires,


not
 because
 I'm
 forcing
 them
 to
 have
 an


entertainment
 moment
 with
 our
 product


by,
 you
 know,
 creating
 a
 Tik
 Tok
 video


that
 goes
 viral.
 So
 that's
 Yeah.


>> Well,
 speaking
 of
 the
 moment,
 we're


recording
 this
 on
 July
 8th
 and
 we
 we


still
 don't
 really
 know
 what's
 happening


with
 the
 tariffs,
 but
 I
 imagine
 in
 the


course
 of
 building
 out
 a
 pizzeria,


you're
 probably
 ordering
 equipment
 from


various
 places,
 uh,
 giant
 pizza
 ovens


and
 all
 that.
 Have
 you
 been
 impacted
 at


all
 by
 the
 tariffs
 yet?


>> Very
 little.
 It's
 still
 very
 confusing


from
 my
 vantage
 point
 as
 to
 what
 is


happening
 or
 what
 is
 supposed
 to
 come


down
 the
 road.
 And
 we
 were
 certainly


anticipating,
 you
 know,
 our
 ovens
 are


from
 Germany.
 Our,
 you
 know,
 a
 variety


of
 pieces
 of
 equipment
 are
 coming
 from


international
 places,
 but
 I
 I
 haven't


seen
 any
 major
 increases.
 We
 did
 have


some
 shipping
 increases.
 We
 make
 these


coffee
 cans
 that
 we
 serve
 our
 roasted


coffee
 in
 that
 come
 from
 China.
 there


was
 a
 massive
 tariff
 increase
 on
 our


shipping.
 That's
 part
 of
 the
 process.


But
 in
 terms
 of,
 you
 know,
 the
 pizzeria


equipment,
 we
 haven't
 seen
 it
 really.


I'm
 anticipating
 that
 potentially
 we're


talking
 about
 a
 10%
 EU
 tariff,
 they


said,
 floating
 around.
 I
 I
 just
 don't


know
 what
 that
 means.
 And
 if
 there's


anticipatory
 price
 increases
 from
 the


vendors
 who
 are
 in
 Italy,
 say
 selling
 us


tomatoes
 or
 who
 are
 in
 a
 variety
 of


other
 places
 in
 Europe
 where
 we
 buy
 some


of
 our
 more
 luxurious
 ingredients.
 Um
 we


we
 just
 haven't
 seen
 those
 yet.
 I
 am
 in


still
 anticipating
 that
 as
 a
 possibility


for
 pizza
 because
 we
 need
 to
 anticipate


that
 and
 we
 are
 certainly
 testing


tomatoes.
 California
 tomatoes
 um
 to
 see


if
 we
 can
 find
 something
 comparable


because
 the
 the
 you
 know
 um
 uh


samarzanos
 are
 truly
 the
 best
 and
 they


do
 grow
 in
 California
 but
 it's
 just
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 different
 thing.
 So,
 we


are
 anticipating
 the
 need
 to
 work
 with


California
 tomatoes.
 Uh,
 but
 so
 far
 have


not
 seen
 anything
 really
 in
 terms
 of
 uh


uh
 tariffs
 uh
 increases
 reaching
 us
 on


this
 side.


>> I
 just
 have
 one
 last
 question
 and
 it


gets
 back
 to
 Los
 Angeles.
 It
 feels
 like


major
 American
 cities
 are
 always
 sort
 of


dying
 and
 thriving
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 And


obviously
 Los
 Angeles,
 you
 know,
 you


hear
 certainly
 hear
 about
 it
 in
 New
 York


and
 Chicago
 and
 u
 Los
 Angeles
 is
 going


through
 a
 lot.
 There
 were
 the
 uh
 fires,


>> the
 recent
 ice
 raids
 and
 riots
 and
 then


you
 know
 the
 people
 what
 people
 and
 I


mention
 you
 know
 because
 it
 was
 in
 this


article
 I
 just
 looked
 up
 and
 reminded
 me


you
 know
 people
 are
 talking
 about


Hollywood
 could
 it
 become
 the
 next


Detroit
 in
 terms
 of
 that
 industry


gutting
 out?
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 it's


probably
 the
 nicest
 climate
 in
 the


entire
 world
 and
 people
 are
 always
 going


to
 want
 to
 live
 in
 Southern
 California.


How
 do
 you
 feel
 about
 doing
 business
 in


Los
 Angeles
 right
 now
 as
 a
 city?


>> It's
 excruciating.
 Um,
 this
 city
 is
 is


uh
 especially
 in
 the
 in
 the
 food


business
 is
 is
 very
 very
 much


struggling.
 Um,
 I've
 never
 ever
 seen
 so


many
 closures
 of
 restaurants,
 good
 ones,


that
 deserve
 to
 be
 open,
 um,
 in
 my
 time,


you
 know,
 let
 alone
 being
 a
 consumer,


but
 being
 in
 the
 business.
 Um,
 I
 think


that,
 uh,
 there's
 a
 an
 endless
 list
 of


factors
 that
 make
 Los
 Angeles


complicated,
 its
 expanse,
 the
 reliance


on
 Hollywood
 as
 a
 major,
 you
 know,


motivator
 for
 or
 a
 major
 provider
 for
 a


large
 number
 of
 people
 in
 terms
 of


income.
 And
 with
 that
 whole
 market


shrinking,
 you
 know,
 you
 do
 see
 a
 a
 lot


less
 b
 business
 happening
 in
 Hollywood


proper.
 That
 said,
 it's
 a
 400
 square


mile
 city.
 You
 have,
 you
 know,
 where


where
 we
 are
 is
 about
 15
 minutes
 from


downtown
 where
 some
 of
 the
 protests
 were


happening
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 stuff,
 but
 I


don't
 see
 anything.
 You
 know,
 it's
 just


a
 regular
 small
 small
 neighborhood


experience
 over
 here.
 Um,
 and
 you're


really
 kind
 of
 like
 these
 neighborhoods


have
 a
 very
 distinctly,
 you
 know,
 unique


way
 of
 behaving.
 So,
 as
 Hollywood
 is


sort
 of
 shrinking
 down
 and
 moving
 east


and
 west,
 you
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 development


and
 then
 you
 also
 see
 a
 lot
 of


gentrification
 protests.
 You
 see
 a
 lot


of
 things
 where
 folks
 are
 uh
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 expansion
 and
 contraction
 in
 this


really
 wide
 city.
 Part
 of
 it
 is
 exciting


because
 it's
 dynamic,
 but
 it's
 also
 just


makes
 things
 very
 difficult
 because
 the


city
 doesn't
 really
 have
 its
 own


identity.
 The
 identity
 is
 defined
 by
 the


neighborhood.
 So,
 as
 downtown
 and


Hollywood
 are
 contracting,
 you
 know,


Highland
 Park
 and
 Glassell
 Park
 and
 this


area
 of
 Glendale
 kind
 of
 on
 the
 east


side
 is
 expanding.
 Silverl
 and
 Echo
 Park


and
 Los
 Filas
 are
 kind
 of
 becoming
 like


Hollywood
 once
 was
 and
 getting
 a
 little


bit
 more
 corporate
 businesses
 in
 there


and
 they're
 all
 looking
 to
 capitalize
 on


the
 growth
 of
 these
 neighborhoods.
 It's


it's
 a
 very
 unique
 place
 and
 it
 but
 it's


it's
 very
 hard
 to
 work
 here
 and
 you
 you


get
 a
 lot
 for
 choosing
 to
 be
 here
 and


operating
 here
 and
 living
 here,
 but


you're
 also
 very
 much
 uh
 behind
 the


eight-ball.
 I
 got
 to
 ask
 one
 more


question,
 but
 why
 is
 a
 San
 Marzano


tomato
 grown
 in
 California
 considered


subpar
 to
 a
 San
 Marzano
 tomato
 grown
 in


Italy?


>> I
 wouldn't
 say
 subpar.
 I
 wouldn't
 say


subpar.
 The
 climate
 is
 vaguely


different.
 Uh,
 slightly
 different.
 So,


you
 end
 up
 with
 a
 little
 bit
 different


result.
 From
 what
 we've
 seen,
 the


Samaranos
 from
 Italy
 end
 up
 being
 a


little
 bit
 sweeter,
 um,
 a
 little
 bit


more
 robust.
 And
 maybe
 that
 has
 to
 do


with
 even
 more
 direct
 sunlight,
 more


volcanic
 soil.
 Who
 knows?
 There's
 a


variety
 of
 different
 different
 reasons


why
 the
 microclimates
 create
 slightly


different
 and
 results.
 It's
 just
 like


wine.
 It's
 sort
 of
 like,
 you
 know,
 you


can
 grow
 the
 same
 grape
 in
 southern


France
 and
 in
 Northern
 California
 and


end
 up
 with
 a
 distinctly
 different


flavor
 based
 on
 the
 microclimate,
 the


soil,
 and
 the
 environment.
 So,
 it's
 uh


it
 may
 just
 be
 our
 own
 projection,
 but


we're
 working
 to
 try
 and
 find
 whatever


the
 uh
 the
 best
 possible
 option
 is
 for


us.


>> All right,
 just
 a
 couple
 seconds
 left.


Give
 us
 one
 sandwich
 recommendation
 here


on
 the
 East
 Coast
 that
 we
 should
 try.


>> Well,
 I
 would
 say
 Oh,
 that's
 really


hard.


>> I
 know
 you're
 going
 to


>> I
 mean,
 Deontes
 Defontes
 in
 Brooklyn
 is


is
 a
 special
 spot,
 but
 you
 know,
 the
 the


the
 deli
 that
 I
 grew
 up
 with
 is
 in


Milbour,
 New
 Jersey.
 It's
 the
 Milbour


Deli
 and
 has
 now
 become
 kind
 of
 like
 a


famous
 deli
 somehow,
 which
 is
 crazy.


>> I'll
 check
 it
 out.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 Andy,
 thank
 you
 so
 much


for
 coming
 on
 OddLots.
 We're
 going
 to


have
 to
 leave
 it
 there,
 but
 uh
 it
 was


really
 fun
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 baking


business
 with
 you.


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 great.
 Thanks
 so
 much,


Andy.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 my
 pleasure.
 Thanks,
 guys.


[Music]


Joe,
 have
 you
 ever
 been
 to
 Alidoros?


>> No.
 In
 Soho.


>> It's
 in
 Soho.
 It
 used
 to
 be
 literally


across
 the
 street
 from
 where
 I
 lived.


Best
 sandwiches
 ever.
 It
 blew
 my
 mind


the
 first
 time
 I
 went
 there.
 They've


expanded
 since
 then.
 The
 uh
 expanded


store
 is
 not
 so
 good.


>> You
 know,
 shout
 out
 to
 our
 producer
 Dash


cuz
 didn't
 he
 like
 he
 did
 that
 tour


where
 he
 like
 tried
 every
 one
 of
 the
 100


best
 sandwiches
 in
 New
 York
 City.
 We
 got


to
 get
 him
 on.


>> We
 should
 interview
 Dash.
 We
 should
 do
 a


lot
 more
 with
 Dash
 at
 some
 point
 about


New
 York
 City
 sandwich.


>> That'd
 be
 fun.
 Okay.
 But
 on
 a
 more


serious
 note,
 there
 was
 lots
 of


interesting
 stuff
 to
 pull
 out
 from


there.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I'm


thinking
 about,
 and
 this
 kind
 of
 came
 up


in
 our
 chicken
 series,
 uh,
 when
 we


talked
 to
 the
 DOJ,
 but
 it's
 that
 idea
 of


the
 tyranny
 of
 the
 middleman,
 right?
 And


this
 idea
 that
 okay,
 obviously
 you're


buying
 flour
 from
 a
 flower
 producer,
 but


then
 in
 between
 the
 producer
 and
 it


getting
 to
 you,
 there's
 the
 distributor


which
 is
 charging
 a
 markup.
 And
 then


when
 you're
 setting
 up
 a
 new
 business


nowadays,
 you
 have
 to
 have
 like


basically
 a
 red
 tape
 sherpa
 to
 walk
 you


through.
 That's
 another
 middleman.
 And


then
 the
 shipping
 costs
 going
 up.
 I


mean,
 shipping
 not
 necessarily
 a


middleman,
 but
 certainly
 the
 middle
 of


the
 process.
 It
 seems
 like
 that's
 where


the
 cost
 pressures
 are
 really
 coming
 in.


No,
 I
 I
 think
 all
 that's
 super


interesting.
 Also,
 this
 idea
 that
 like


you
 could
 have
 an
 Uber
 for
 distribution,


but
 then
 you
 lose
 that


>> a
 bread
 bus,


>> but
 then
 you
 lose
 that
 personal


relationship.
 And
 if
 that's
 important


because
 you
 need
 to
 hear
 feedback
 from


the
 chef
 at
 that
 restaurant,
 then
 you


don't
 get
 it.
 If
 you
 don't
 own
 the


distribution,


>> um,
 and
 then
 just,
 you
 know,
 LA
 itself,


we
 should
 do
 at
 some
 point
 we
 got
 to
 go


back
 to
 LA
 because
 it
 does,
 I
 mean,


incredible
 place,
 but
 incredibly
 number


of
 like
 sort
 of
 ranching
 things
 going
 on


in
 that
 city.
 And
 opening
 a
 restaurant,


as
 you
 mentioned,
 sort
 of
 seems
 crazy
 in


the
 easiest
 of
 times.
 Like
 I
 feel
 like


you
 have
 to
 have
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 brain


damage
 to
 do
 that.
 And
 then
 to
 do
 it
 in


uh
 there's
 a
 lot
 there
 that
 was
 very


interesting.


>> I
 want
 to
 learn
 more
 about
 the
 pizza


business
 as
 well.
 We're
 in
 New
 York.
 We


should
 do
 pizza.


>> We're
 going to
 do
 a
 pizza

>> All right.

 we

 it
