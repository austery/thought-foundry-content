Alright, it's 1756,
you're all aboard a British naval vessel
headed to the New World.
You're down below deck
with your fellow sailors,
and you're all sick.
Your legs are swollen,
your gums are bleeding,
you just lost a tooth.
You go to the ship's doctor
and he tells you this is due
to internal decay and laziness.
(Laughter)
You ask about this foreign fruit medicine,
the citrus medicine that you could take,
and he tells you that this is not
a treatment for what you have,
it’s too simple, it’s a plant medicine.
And he’s an anti-fruiter.
(Laughter)
And instead, he prescribes you
arsenic tonics.
True story.
And you get worse.
And when you get to the new world,
half of your shipmates are deceased.
My name is Nolan Williams,
and I'm here to talk to you
about anti-fruiters.
People who weaponize scientific skepticism
to thwart new treatments
from getting out to the world.
(Applause)
And so scurvy is an illness
that killed two million people
from the time of Columbus
all the way through to the time
of widespread citrus adoption.
And scurvy is the result
of a lack of vitamin C in the diet.
And the reason why these sailors
had a lack of vitamin C
is because it was a long sea voyage
so you need to eat dried meats
and that sort of thing.
And so we observed early on in the 1500s,
this association between
eating citrus fruit
and the prevention
or the treatment of scurvy.
And so it was written early on
that this was a precious medicine,
something that could be used
for this problem.
So much so that it actually
birthed the world's first clinical trial.
So the clinical trial,
as a scientific tool,
is the result of trying
to find a solution for scurvy.
And so they gave
all these man-made treatments,
and then they gave citrus.
And I don't have to tell you
what the answer
to this scientific question was.
The people that got the citrus fruit
were helping everybody else
at the end of the experiment.
But there was a reaction.
The royal societies
did not like this idea.
There was backlash,
and many thought this was too simple
to be a solution for such a problem,
that a plant could not solve
such a complex problem,
and instead they prescribed
arsenic, mercury,
man-made chemicals.
Now science eventually prevailed.
You know, we were able to see
that this was actually helpful.
But the problem was
that from the time of James Lind's study
to the time of widespread implementation
was more than 100 years,
a million people died.
But this was a war waged against progress
by these anti-fruiters.
And it was another 100 years
before we even knew
what was in the citrus fruit
that was improving scurvy.
Right, we'd rid the world
of scurvy at that point.
And so I'm going to switch
to a new plant medicine: psychedelics.
Psychedelics have been used
for thousands of years
by Indigenous populations.
The Tabernanthe iboga root bark
of central West Africa
was used by the Bwiti for psychospiritual
purposes for centuries,
and they knew that this
was a powerful compound.
It needed to be done in certain,
kind of medical-like or medical settings
in modern medicine.
And we need to be able to monitor people
because it does have risks,
like a rare cardiac arrhythmia and death.
And so the modern scourge of sailors,
Navy Seals,
isn't scurvy.
It's traumatic brain injury
and post-traumatic stress disorder.
And the treatments that are out there,
oral antidepressants and talk therapy,
do help some people, but they're limited.
And so these veterans have decided
when they don't get, you know,
improvement from the standard treatments
that some of them have gone out
to take psychedelic medicines.
And I was approached by one
such veteran, Marcus Capone,
him and his wife, Amber.
Marcus had been a Navy Seal for 13 years
and suffered many
traumatic brain injuries,
had PTSD once he got out.
And he went down to Mexico,
outside of the US,
as a US soldier, outside of the US,
down to a foreign country
to receive a compound
that is illegal in the US,
a compound that he believes
saved his life.
And when I met these folks,
I heard the story,
at first I was a little bit skeptical.
But then once I heard
Marcus's story and other stories,
I became convinced that this
was something worth studying.
So now I'm going to let you
listen to Erick's story,
and you tell me what you think.
(Video) Erick: I don't know exactly
all the reasons why I'm not whole.
I know a lot of the symptoms,
like being a basically barely functioning
alcoholic my entire life
to the point of neglecting myself,
neglecting my kids.
It's so bad, that I have
like, zero control over it.
I haven’t gone a day without drinking
in probably 10 years.
This is my last chance.
I want to be able to heal myself
so that I can be whole ...
For my family.
NW: So, this is the study
that we conducted at Stanford.
Just like Erick, most
of these folks had PTSD
in addition to traumatic
brain injury beforehand.
But after, they had
a significant reduction
and crossed the line
to no longer meet PTSD diagnosis
after they received ibogaine.
Significant reductions in anxiety,
80-plus percent,
significant reductions in depression
and, remarkably,
resolution of disability
from traumatic brain injury.
Something that we haven't seen before.
So now I'm going to let
Erick tell you about that.
(Video) Erick: It’s been
about seven months,
and pretty much everything is different.
A buddy of mine came
by the house the other day.
He had a drink with him, he drove there.
"Hey, you want a drink?"
"Nah, man, I'm good,
I don't drink anymore."
He's like ...
"I'll get you a drink."
I'm like, "No, I really
don't drink anymore."
He's like, "Whatever,
I'll go get you a drink."
No, he didn't believe me.
I mean, we were standing there talking
for probably 30 minutes.
In that time before I would have smoked
five cigarettes, you know.
And he was like,
"Wait a minute,
did you quit smoking, too?"
I was like, “Yeah.”
"What?"
Everything has changed.
It's hard to tell somebody like,
one weekend and everything's different.
Like some kind of magic pill
or something, which it's not.
I mean, the real work started
after the experience,
but the experience gave me the tools
to be able to do the work
in the first place.
There are so many people
that could heal from this.
There are so many people
that would still be here.
I have friends that would still be here.
I have family that would still be here.
NW: So now, I'm going to let
Erick describe the effect.
What did he feel while
he was under this compound?
And what a lot of people will describe
is that they go back
and look through earlier-life memories,
and they're able to see these memories
from a detached third-party perspective
and look at them and see them
and really reassimilate them into meaning.
(Video) Erick: The visuals
that I remember the most
were like going through
like, a photo album,
but like a Rolodex and like,
you flip it as fast as you can
and everything goes by and it's a blur.
There's like clips out of my life.
Like an outsider looking in.
It allowed me to confront traumas
that had much more
of an impact on me than I realized.
That was one of the biggest things
I got from the weekend, is just like ...
that I need to stop poisoning myself.
In every aspect possible.
NW: So just like citrus for scurvy,
psychedelic plant medicines
were initially seen as quite positive,
and even the National Institute
of Mental Health director
in the mid '60s thought
that these were powerful,
potentially powerful therapeutic tools
and tools for understanding
the brain-behavior relationships.
But unlike citrus for scurvy
psychedelic plant medicines,
these plant medicines, were made illegal.
Can you imagine how much longer
it would have taken for us
to be able to get citrus out
if we made the orange illegal?
And so there's hope.
A small group of scientists
in the early 2000s,
including some in the audience,
have been able to get these studies
back up and running.
Some of them all the way through
to being evaluated or reevaluated
by the FDA very soon.
Ibogaine, we're trying to get
an investigational new drug application
to the FDA right now.
Now am I telling you to go and run out
and go to Mexico and take psychedelics?
No.
You need to wait until everything's done,
until the trials are done
if they are to show us
that these are positive.
However, what I am saying
is that the data shouldn't
be evaluated by anti-fruiters.
It shouldn't be evaluated
by believers either.
It should be evaluated
by open-minded people
that are able to look
at the data clear-minded, right?
And what I'm also here to tell you is,
is that these compounds sit on Schedule I.
And what that means is
that they're on the same level of control
as heroin.
Right?
It means that there's no medicinal use
and they have a high abuse liability.
How many of you think that there was
no medicinal help for Erick?
How many thought that there was?
And so you can all sit here and think,
in the 1750s,
it would have been crazy
to make the orange illegal.
What will our grandchildren
think about us?
Right?
And so we're on this edge between
institutional rejection and acceptance
and the time, the clock is ticking.
And I'm going to ask you,
did we make the orange illegal?
Only time will tell.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Couple of questions.
So you didn't, I think for everyone,
clearly answer that question
of whether Erick needed additional help
with additional drugs, for example.
NW: Yeah, he was off of everything.
You know, these folks end up
needing psychotherapy beforehand,
and they need a lot
of psychotherapy you know, after,
so that is part of it.
CA: But in terms of the drug treatment,
ibogaine, that was it?
NW: That was it.
CA: OK.
One of the things that I learned from you,
and tell me if I've got this right,
is that the reason why addiction
becomes so much of a problem
in so many cases
is that the more you take a substance,
it dials up in your brain
the amount of dopamine
that you need to feel OK.
NW: Yep.
CA: And one possible effect of ibogaine
is that it basically resets
that relentless scale
that is otherwise almost impossible
to psychologically do.
NW: Yeah, that's the view.
Is that part of what is going on
is that this actually
promotes growth factors
called glial-derived neurotrophic
factor in the brain,
which has a role in regulating
dopamine neurons.
And so the view is that this kind of
resets those dopamine neurons
to function pre-addiction-like.
CA: And it's also true, I think,
that if you take ibogaine unsupervised,
you risk like, heart attack.
NW: It's an arrhythmia,
so an abnormal heart rhythm.
And that's why it's important
to do this under supervision.
We think prophylaxing
with certain kind of very low-risk
cardiac arrhythmia medications
like magnesium sulfate
can actually reduce the risk quite a bit.
But it is something that needs
to be in medical supervision
and in cardiac supervision.
CA: But to be clear, in your sort of study
of different kinds
of medical interventions,
how dramatic is this?
NW: Yeah, I mean, we've never seen
such, kind of a broad-acting,
CNS compound before, right?
I mean, in my view, it's one
of the most amazing drugs on the planet
because of this.
And so, you know, it's the equivalent,
like a broad-acting antibiotic
that can treat all infections.
It seems to be able to treat
this kind of, you know.
And it's early days.
So we still have to do a lot of work
to prove this totally in ibogaine.
But, you know, TBI, PTSD, depression,
that's a really broad effect.
CA: Thank you so much
for bringing news of this to TED.
(Applause)
