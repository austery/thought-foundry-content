From

 Times,

Here's
 what
 we're
 covering.


The
 Times
 has
 learned
 new
 details
 about


a
 US
 attack
 in
 Venezuela
 from
 last
 week


that
 President
 Trump
 has
 been
 talking


up.


>> There
 was
 a
 major
 explosion
 in
 the
 dock


area
 where
 they
 load
 the
 boats
 up
 with


drugs.
 They
 load
 the
 boats
 up
 with


drugs.
 So,
 we
 hit
 all
 the
 boats
 and
 now


we
 hit
 the
 area.


>> People
 briefed
 on
 the
 strike
 tell
 the


Times
 that
 the
 CIA
 used
 a
 drone
 to
 hit
 a


port
 facility
 where
 US
 officials
 think


the
 gang
 Trend
 Ara
 was
 storing
 narcotics


and
 potentially
 preparing
 to
 move
 drugs


onto
 boats.
 While
 the
 US
 has
 been


targeting
 vessels
 at
 sea
 for
 months,


claiming
 they're
 smuggling
 drugs,
 the


dock
 strike
 marks
 the
 first
 known


American
 operation
 inside
 Venezuela.
 It


suggests
 the
 Trump
 administration
 has


launched
 an
 aggressive
 new
 phase
 of
 its


pressure
 campaign
 against
 the
 country's


president
 Nicholas
 Maduro.
 The
 White


House
 has
 alleged
 that
 there
 are
 close


ties
 between
 Maduro
 and
 Trende
 Aaragua


even
 though
 the
 US's
 own
 intelligence


agencies
 have
 cast
 doubt
 on
 those


claims.
 For
 its
 part,
 Maduro's


government
 has
 not
 directly
 commented
 on


the
 dock
 strike.
 But
 yesterday,


Venezuela's
 interior
 minister
 denounced


months
 of
 quote
 imperial
 madness,


harassment,
 threats,
 attacks,
 piracy,


and
 murders.
 [music]


Meanwhile,
 the
 US
 military
 carried
 out


another
 deadly
 strike
 yesterday
 [music]


against
 alleged
 drug
 traffickers,


hitting
 a
 boat
 in
 the
 Eastern
 Pacific.


Pentagon
 officials
 said
 Defense


Secretary
 Pete
 Hegath
 directed
 the


attack,
 which
 killed
 two
 people.
 They


said
 the
 boat
 was
 traveling
 along
 a


quote
 known
 narot
 trafficking
 route.
 It


was
 the
 30th
 attack
 of
 its
 kind


announced
 by
 the
 military
 since
 early


September.
 The
 strikes,
 which
 have


killed
 at
 least
 107
 people,
 have
 been


condemned
 by
 legal
 experts
 and
 members


of
 Congress
 [music]
 who
 have
 called
 them


extrajudicial
 killings.


[music]


In
 Russia,
 officials
 are
 accusing


Ukraine
 of
 targeting
 one
 of
 Vladimir


Putin's
 homes,
 saying
 Ukraine
 launched
 a


wave
 of
 attack
 drones
 on
 Monday
 near
 one


of
 Putin's
 most
 secretive
 hideouts.


>> It's
 one
 thing
 to
 be
 offensive


because
 they
 were
 offensive.
 It's


another
 thing
 to
 attack
 his
 house.


>> President
 Trump
 said
 he
 was
 very
 angry


about
 the
 alleged
 attack,
 though
 Russia


has
 provided
 no
 clear-cut
 evidence
 that


it
 happened.


>> Find
 out.
 I
 mean,
 you're
 saying
 maybe


the
 attack
 didn't
 take
 place.
 It's


possible
 to,
 I
 guess.
 But
 President


Putin
 told
 me
 this
 morning
 it
 did.


>> Russia's
 accusation
 came
 just
 after


Trump
 hosted
 Blloimir
 Zilinski
 for
 talks


about
 a
 possible
 deal
 to
 end
 the
 war
 in


Ukraine.
 Silinski
 called
 the
 claims
 of


an
 attack
 a
 complete
 fabrication
 and


said
 that
 Russia
 had
 invented
 it
 as
 a


pretext
 to
 undermine
 the
 negotiations.


Russian
 officials
 have
 now
 issued
 a


dramatic
 threat
 to
 harden
 the
 country's


stance
 in
 peace
 talks
 and
 said
 that


their
 position
 on
 previously
 reached


agreements
 about
 ending
 the
 war
 would
 be


quote
 revised.
 In
 an
 incident
 2
 years


ago,
 Ukraine
 denied
 sending
 a
 pair
 of


drones
 that
 exploded
 over
 Putin's


residence
 in
 the
 Kremlin,
 but
 US


officials
 determined
 the
 country
 was


likely
 behind
 it.


>> [music]


>> The
 Trump
 administration
 has
 announced


that
 it
 will
 provide
 an
 initial
 $2


billion
 for
 United
 Nations
 aid
 programs


in
 the
 coming
 year.
 That
 will
 likely


keep
 the
 US
 as
 the
 biggest
 international


aid
 donor,
 even
 as
 President
 Trump
 has


drastically
 scaled
 back
 funding.
 Over


the
 last
 decade,
 the
 US
 regularly
 used


to
 cover
 a
 third
 or
 more
 of
 the
 UN's


total
 humanitarian
 efforts.
 This
 year


that
 dropped
 to
 about
 15%.


Trump
 has
 frequently
 criticized
 foreign


aid
 as
 wasteful
 and
 rife
 with
 fraud.
 And


the
 new
 pledge
 came
 with
 a
 stark
 warning


for
 the
 UN.
 The
 State
 Department
 told


the
 organization
 it
 must
 cut
 out
 what


the
 US
 called
 bureaucratic
 overhead
 and


ideological
 creep
 and
 said
 individual
 UN


agencies
 will
 need
 to
 adapt,
 shrink
 or


die.
 Across
 the
 globe,
 international


relief
 agencies
 are
 facing
 a
 funding


crisis
 as
 many
 other
 Western
 governments


make
 cuts,
 too.
 One
 former
 UN


humanitarian
 aid
 official
 told
 the


Times,
 quote,
 "Never
 has
 the
 gap
 between


recorded
 need
 and
 available
 funding
 been


so
 severe.


[music]


Why
 do
 these
 kids
 have
 three
 full
 sets


of
 uniforms
 [music]
 complete
 with
 camo


gradients
 and
 metallic
 lettering
 like


they're
 in
 the
 MLB
 All-Star
 game?


>> For
 some
 families
 in
 the
 US,
 youth


sports
 have
 become
 allconsuming.


>> Listen,
 a
 6
 a.m.
 youth
 sports
 tournament


on
 a
 Saturday
 will
 have
 you
 starting
 to


root
 against
 your
 kids'
 team.
 There
 are


demanding
 schedules,
 weekendl
 long


tournaments,
 even
 cross-country
 flights


on
 top
 of
 huge
 financial
 investments.


>> The
 nearest
 I
 can
 figure
 we're
 spending


about
 25
 grand
 a
 year
 on
 the,
 you
 know,


a
 little
 over
 two
 grand
 a
 month
 on
 these


sports.
 And
 I


>> and
 while
 sports
 have
 been
 shown
 to
 help


kids
 build
 self-esteem
 and
 confidence,
 a


growing
 body
 of
 research
 also
 shows
 that


kids
 are
 burning
 out
 fast.
 Studies
 have


shown
 that
 pressure
 from
 overbearing


coaches
 and
 parents
 can
 stunt
 children's


emotional
 well-being
 and
 that


overtraining
 young
 athletes
 is
 leading


to
 injuries.
 Demanding
 coaches
 and


parents
 screaming
 on
 the
 sidelines


aren't
 new,
 obviously,
 but
 the
 pressure


has
 only
 ramped
 up
 as
 a
 growing
 number


of
 kids
 sports
 leagues
 are
 now
 being
 run


as
 for-profit
 businesses.
 In
 response
 to


the
 new
 intensity,
 there's
 now
 a
 broad


movement
 to
 increase
 training
 for


coaches
 so
 they're
 more
 informed
 on


mental
 health
 issues.
 In
 the
 last
 few


years,
 one
 expert
 told
 the
 Times,
 seven


states
 have
 begun
 requiring
 coaches
 to


receive
 mental
 health
 training.
 And
 some


leagues
 are
 taking
 it
 into
 their
 own


hands,
 bringing
 in
 consultants
 to
 talk


to
 parents
 about
 their
 role
 in
 the


potential
 burnout.
 One
 former
 MLB
 player


who
 gives
 these
 talks
 told
 the
 Times,


quote,
 "You
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 parents
 who


are
 sports
 [music]
 fans
 that
 want
 to


watch
 youth
 sports
 the
 same
 way
 they


watch
 pro
 sports."
 He
 said
 parents
 need


to
 take
 a
 step
 back
 and
 help
 turn
 down


the
 pressure.


[music]


And
 finally,
 years
 ago,
 two
 mountain


climbers
 who
 are
 twin
 brothers
 set
 out


to
 climb
 the
 highest
 peak
 in
 every


state.
 Once
 that
 was
 done,
 they
 started


looking
 at
 the
 highest
 peak
 in
 every


country.
 But
 they
 had
 questions
 about


the
 data.
 The
 more
 mountains
 they


climbed,
 the
 more
 they
 wondered
 if
 the


peaks
 had
 been
 measured
 correctly.
 They


now
 run
 a
 project
 called
 country
 high


points
 where
 they
 check
 for
 themselves.


And
 in
 a
 recent
 paper,
 they
 established


new
 high
 points
 in
 five
 countries.
 To


make
 their
 measurements,
 they
 along
 with


a
 few
 other
 collaborators
 climb
 with
 not


just
 food,
 water,
 and
 first
 aid,
 but


also
 advanced
 surveying
 equipment.


Basically,
 more
 accurate
 versions
 of
 the


GPS
 installed
 in
 smartphones.
 Where
 the


find
 my
 phone
 dot
 can
 be
 accurate
 down


to
 a
 few
 feet,
 this
 equipment
 measures


down
 to
 the
 inch.
 It
 probably
 helps
 that


the
 two
 brothers
 are
 mechanical


engineers.
 Their
 project
 has
 now
 helped


fill
 in
 or
 correct
 the
 topographical


record
 in
 Gambia,
 Usuzbekiststan,
 Togo,


Guineasau
 and
 more.
 Of
 course,
 getting


any
 maps
 officially
 updated
 is
 a
 whole


other
 feat.
 There
 can
 be
 peerreview


processes
 and
 different
 countries
 have


different
 standards,
 but
 the
 brothers


are
 publishing
 their
 info
 as
 they


collect
 it.
 They
 told
 the
 Times,
 [music]


"Our
 goal
 in
 all
 this
 is
 to
 find
 the


truth."


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
