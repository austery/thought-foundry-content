We are going to be unemployed.
We are never getting a job.
And I applied to 647 roles
before I got one.
One of my friends had an AI interview.
The AI did the interviewing.?
Yeah.
Someone tell me.
Someone tell me and explain to me
what is going on
with the job market recently.
Okay, okay, I'll do it.
As you've just seen, to a lot of
especially young people,
it feels like it's really difficult
to get a job right now.
Sure.
Officially,
the economy is still doing quite
fine and stock
markets are certainly super high.
So what's going on?
Why is it so difficult
to get a job right now?
According to a large share of bosses,
the reason is simple.
Most tasks carried out by entry level
colleagues could be performed by a AI.
But is that really true?
Is the job market really that bad?
Is it especially bad for young people?
And most importantly, is it bad because of
AI or are bosses just saying that
because it's much less politically risky
than blaming Donald Trump's trade war?
Or it's easier than admitting that they
hired too many people during the pandemic.
That is the question economists have been
doing a ton of in-depth research about.
And yes, as always
here on Money and Macro,
we will spare you
the need to read all of that yourself.
And we have summarized
the three most important explanations for
this phenomenon in this video.
But before getting into exactly
what they are, let's have a quick
look at the data.
Are these TikTokers right?
Is it actually difficult
to get a job right now?
The most obvious place to look
first is the unemployment rate.
That is, the percentage of working age
people actively looking for a job,
but who cannot find one right now
in the US, we can clearly see that
indeed, unemployment has been rising
since the summer of 2022
from about 3.5% to 4.3%.
Meanwhile, in big European economies
like the UK, Germany,
where a job market crisis has also been
in the news a lot, we can also see that
unemployment is already heading back
towards levels only seen in the pandemic.
But what's really striking,
though, about the labor market today
is that we have seen that despite
some really spectacular layoffs at high
profile companies,
and the rise in unemployment really
does not seem to be driven
by so many more layoffs,
but rather by a quite spectacular
fall in new job postings by companies.
As we can see here.
That trend holds for the US,
but also for the UK and Germany.
However, if we look at whether or not
young people in particular
are hit the hardest.
We can see that in all three countries,
youth unemployment is quite a bit higher
than regular unemployment.
But if we look at how much it's risen
since 2022, we can see that
only in the UK has the youth unemployment
really risen much faster.
In Germany, It's pretty close
to regular unemployment, and in the US,
young workers have actually still done
better than average since 2022.
That's kind of strange,
given that AI was supposed to have taken
so many entry level jobs.
So there's clearly more going on here.
In fact, we've identified three
major trends
that can help explain
why you can't find a job anymore.
Yes, AI is still a factor,
but it's more subtle than you think.
So let's get into it.
Here's how the rise of AI
is actually impacting the job market.
One thing is for sure,
many businesses are already using AI
and many more are planning
to introduce it.
In Germany, for example,
about 27% of firms are actively using AI.
Another 80% is planning to use it
and 34% is actively discussing it.
And only about 21%
think it's not relevant.
These are very impressive numbers.
Just to illustrate how spectacular
AI adoption percentages are.
Have a look at this graph comparing
personal AI adoption to people adopting,
for example, personal computers
in the 1980s or the internet in the 1990s.
This means that AI is the most rapidly
adopted technology in human history.
Think about that.
So actually, it would be quite straight
if we did not see any effect at all
in the labor market.
But just because businesses are using AI,
that by itself
does not mean that it's costing jobs.
After all, companies
could be using AI to replace people,
but they could also be using it
to make existing workers more productive.
To find out
whether AI is getting people fired
or not hired, at least, Stanford
economists Erik Brynjolfsson, Bharat
Chander and Raju Chen studied
super detailed payroll data
from occupations
that were especially exposed to new
AI models like software developers
and customer service.
As you can see here, early career software
developers who tended to support
older coders by doing simple tasks
rapidly, disappeared from companies
after the launch of ChatGPT
indicated by the vertical line.
However, more experienced coders
kept being hired.
And as you can see here, the same trend
can be seen in customer services.
After GPT, young people disappeared
from customer service centers
at a rapid pace
while more experienced workers remained.
Meanwhile,
young people in less exposed jobs
like stock clerks
working in warehouses and health aides
did not see this
massive drop in employment.
That is some pretty solid evidence
that AI is absolutely impacting jobs,
but only in certain sectors
and in these sectors,
it's the young,
less experienced people that are indeed
hurt more
than their more experienced colleagues.
But of course, just looking at one
study is not enough.
Another really interesting study was done
by economists Hui, Reshef and Zhou.
Rather than looking at workers,
they looked at freelancer jobs
posted on the popular jobs
market website Upwork.
Specifically,
they studied two distinct AI waves.
First, they research
how text based AI models like
GPT affected writing based freelance jobs
like copywriters.
And after that, they looked at
how image models like Midjourney and DALL
E affected the freelance job market
for graphic designers.
Now, interestingly,
they found a clear impact
before the introduction of these models,
which is the black vertical line, again,
exposed and non-expert.
Those jobs had a stable relation
compared to each other.
And then after AI, there is a clear trend
showing the number of jobs were exposed.
Jobs declined rapidly
compared to these non exposed jobs.
Combining these two studies,
I think there's clear evidence
that AI is already leading
to some job losses where, given that it
mostly affects less experienced people,
this could indeed show up as less hiring,
making it more difficult to find a job,
especially for young people.
Unless AI is creating more jobs
than it is destroying.
After all, in the past, new technologies
have obliterated specific jobs very often.
But soon after, new jobs
appeared to replace them.
For example, the invention
of the printing press
decimated the jobs market for scribes.
But at the same time it created
jobs like book
binding, publishing, and book selling.
The invention of digital technologies
ruined the job market for switchboard
operators, or so-called human computers,
who did complex calculations by hand.
But over time, it
created a lot of new jobs like programmer,
web developer, and data scientist.
So is that the case today as well?
Yeah. Probably somewhat.
A recent analysis by researcher
Henley Wing Chiu
on the US job market reveals
that many of the jobs with the biggest
declines were exactly those that
AI affected the most.
Computer graphics
artist, photographer and writer.
On the other hand,
the US job seeing the most increases
last year was Machine Learning Engineer.
Sadly, his analysis
only gives us percentages though,
so it does not tell us
exactly how many jobs were lost
so that we cannot compare them to jobs
gained.
In fact,
I couldn't find any good research on this,
but if I had to put my money on it,
I bet that we are seeing both effects
of AI right now.
It is making some workers more productive,
but on average
is also costing more jobs
than it is creating.
But I think so far this effect is limited
to sectors
like graphic design and writing.
However, as you can see in this graph
by the Economic Innovation group,
unemployment for jobs
that are super exposed to AI like
the orange and blue lines is rising.
Absolutely.
But actually unemployment in less exposed
jobs like the green and yellow lines
is rising as well.
So I cannot fully explain
why you cannot find a job right now.
To truly get to the bottom of why
it's so difficult to find a job right now.
We need to talk about a second
major global development.
But first, we need to talk about something
else that's happening behind the scenes.
Because just like the job market,
a lot of systems we rely on every day
are changing in ways
most people do not notice,
including the networks
that run our phones.
That brings us to today's sponsor, Cape.
America's
only privacy first mobile carrier.
If you are uncomfortable with big carriers
like AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile
engaging in opaque data selling practices,
then you'll be happy
to know that there's now
finally a true privacy first alternative.
Cape.
Cape is built up from the ground
for privacy and security.
Sure, you can use a VPN or encrypted
messenger app,
but you'd always be vulnerable
at the network level.
Cape fixes that.
Unlike traditional carriers,
Cape does not ask for your name,
address, or even Social Security number
when you sign up.
It collects really the bare
minimum and automatically deletes
what it does collect.
Cape also protects against SIM swaps
by using a 24 word private key
that only you control.
No customer service agent can move
your number without it, and it's enhanced.
Signaling protection blocks
the kind of network level of text
that can reveal your location or intercept
your calls.
Cape is not just another reseller either.
It's a heavy MVNO,
which means it owns and operates its own
mobile core, giving it total control
over the data which it gets collected
and which does not, how it's secured
and who can access it.
That's something no other privacy
focused carrier in the US does.
So if you're tired of being the product
and you actually want a carrier
that keeps your data private, check out
Cape through my link at Cape.co/moneymacro
and use my code MANDM33
to get 33% off
your first six months of Cape, or use

and start protecting your phone today.
That said, let's get back to explanation
number two
massive policy uncertainty.
Of course,
this reason is mostly about one man.
Thank you everybody, and thank you
to the media, the media has been terrific.
Believe it or not,
I didn’t use- see?
I didn’t use the words fake news one time.
That's right.
Mr. Trump and his trade war
so far has really been characterized
by chaos and uncertainty.
Have a look at this fascinating graph
by the Financial Times.
It shows that on average, Trump's proposed
tariffs have been going up and down
like crazy over the year.
Meanwhile,
actual tariffs have slowly followed.
But crucially, businesses
did not know that in advance.
It's well known that when governments
swing between aggressive and unpredictable
policies, affected businesses
freeze, firms delay hiring, postpone
investments and wait to see what rules
they'll be operating under next.
And yes, we can actually see in the data
that uncertainty is unusually high
these days.
The so-called policy
uncertainty index has exploded
over the past year in both Europe
and the United States, coinciding
with Donald Trump
taking office in January 2025.
Could this explain
why companies are not hiring anymore?
All around the world, former economics
Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman argues
that Trump's wildly erratic policies
are in fact creating huge uncertainty,
which is deterring many companies
from hiring workers.
His main piece of evidence for this
is that the number of long term unemployed
has really surged since Liberation Day,
the moment
Trump announced his most dramatic tariff
changes.
The second piece of evidence concerns
Black workers whose unemployment rate
has also climbed sharply
after Liberation Day.
Historically, Black workers are among
the first to be laid off
and the last to be rehired in the US.
So rising uncertainty there is really
a signal of broader problems.
But Trump policies have wider impact
that go beyond U.S.
borders as well.
For example, Germany's Ifo institute
estimates that German manufacturing
could shrink by about 2.8%
because of them, with the automobile
and pharmaceutical industries
taking the hardest hits.
But Germany's uncertainty
doesn't come from Trump alone.
It comes from China as well,
where a massive industrial rise is hitting
German industry especially hard.
In the less exposed countries, jobs don't
seem to be under as much pressure yet.
The Netherlands, France, Spain
and all of these countries,
AI is playing a major role,
but there's less uncertainty,
and this could explain
why unemployment is not yet rising
as much in these countries.
Meanwhile, the UK is also less
exposed to the trade war,
but their businesses have indicated
they are mostly concerned
about uncertainty from its own government
that is, struggling to provide clarity
on how much it will raise taxes,
how much it will increase the minimum wage
and increase
the national insurance contributions
that these firms have to pay.
However, whether it's about the US, China
or UK uncertainty, there's one
big problem with the uncertainty
explanation in general; the timing.
If we look at the falling hiring
trend over a couple of years,
it just doesn't match up.
Jobs are decreasing
ever since 2022, and in turn
they only really became extreme in 2025.
Therefore, to fully understand
why it's so difficult to find a job
right now, we need to talk
about our final explanation,
which is the unwinding
of the Covid economy.
You see, one thing
I’m missing
in the current media landscape,
and that I hope to address
with this channel,
is that a truly long term
macroeconomic perspective.
Yes, as we have seen,
unemployment is rising.
But what happens
if we zoom out a couple of decades?
Then you get this picture in the US,
you get this picture in the UK
and you get this picture in Germany.
Now, if we draw a line on these graphs,
we can see that unemployment is still well
under- or maybe in the case of the UK,
near to its long term historical average.
On top of that,
two things really stand out to me.
If I look at these pictures.
The first is that unemployment
comes and goes in cycles.
And the second is that unemployment
was really exceptionally low
right before and after Covid.
This was the period
of the Great resignation,
where jobs were so available
that people were able to leave
abusive bosses and underpaid jobs
and move to better paid positions.
That actually sounds like the way the job
market should always be, doesn't it?
So what ended this period?
Well, I think the most plausible
explanation is the end
of high government
stimulus and ultra low interest rates.
Governments are now worried again
about that.
And central banks
have increased interest rates.
As a result, less money is circulating
in most economies and as a result of that,
there just now aren't as many jobs
as there used to be.
So to get back to our original question,
is it really that difficult to find a job
right now, especially for young people,
like we're seeing in these TikToks?
Yes, absolutely.
At least when you compare it
to just three years ago, this can
partially be explained by AI sure,
and some geopolitical uncertainty.
Sure.
But historically speaking, sadly,
it looks like
what we've seen so far
is really simply an return to normality.
That can be explained almost completely
by the end of Covid stimulus.
So will this situation get better
or worse?
Well, we can never know for sure.
On the optimistic side,
we have seen in the past that technologies
have actually created more jobs,
Sometimes.
It took time for these to develop though,
so I do think there is good reason
to be hopeful that we haven't seen some of
these more subtle benefits of AI yet.
But honestly, my expectation
is that geopolitical
uncertainty will only get worse
as we enter a multipolar world order.
On top of that, AI adoption will likely
first lead to more job losses.
And with government debt
so high and societies quickly aging,
I certainly think it's unlikely
we will see more government
stimulus on the level
as we saw during Covid again soon.
So I think it's unlikely that
the job market will get much better soon.
But yeah, what do you think?
