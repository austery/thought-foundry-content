From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Wednesday,
 February
 25th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


>> Mr.
 Speaker,
 the
 President
 of
 the
 United


States.


>> President
 Trump
 delivered
 the
 longest


State
 of
 the
 Union
 address
 in
 American


history
 last
 night,
 describing
 the


country
 as
 safe
 and
 booming
 under
 his


leadership.
 Today,
 our
 border
 is
 secure.


Our
 spirit
 is
 restored.


Inflation
 is
 plummeting.
 Incomes
 are


rising
 fast.


>> It
 clocked
 in
 at
 1
 hour
 and
 47
 minutes.


>> Our
 country
 is
 winning
 again.
 In
 fact,


we're
 winning
 so
 much
 that
 we
 really


don't
 know
 what
 to
 do
 about
 it.


>> Throughout
 the
 night,
 Trump
 leaned


heavily
 into
 theatrics,
 a
 call
 back
 to


his
 reality
 TV
 roots.
 Alejandra,
 I'm


pleased
 to
 inform
 you
 that
 not
 only
 has


your
 uncle
 been
 released,
 but
 he
 is
 here


tonight.
 We
 brought
 him
 over.


>> He
 staged
 a
 reunion
 between
 a
 woman
 and


her
 uncle,
 a
 former
 prisoner
 under


Nicholas
 Maduro's
 regime
 in
 Venezuela.


He
 surprised
 a
 National
 Guard
 member
 who


was
 shot
 in
 DC
 last
 year
 with
 a
 Purple


Heart.
 and
 he
 had
 the
 men's
 Olympic


hockey
 team
 emerge
 from
 the
 balcony


above
 him,
 declaring
 he
 was
 giving
 the


goalie
 the
 Presidential
 Medal
 of


Freedom.


>> What
 a
 special
 job
 you
 did.
 What
 special


champions
 you
 are.
 Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> Policywise,
 Trump
 mostly
 focused
 on
 the


economy
 and
 immigration.
 Those
 used
 to


be
 winning
 topics
 for
 him,
 but
 polls


show
 most
 Americans
 now
 disapprove
 by
 a


wide
 margin
 of
 how
 he's
 handling
 them.


But
 one
 thing
 is
 certain.
 I
 will
 never


allow
 the
 world's
 number
 one
 sponsor
 of


terror,
 which
 they
 are
 by
 far,
 to
 have
 a


nuclear
 weapon.
 Can't
 let
 that
 happen.


>> It
 took
 the
 president
 about
 90
 minutes


into
 the
 speech
 to
 get
 to
 Iran,
 the


topic
 much
 of
 the
 world
 was
 eager
 to


hear
 about
 since
 he
 has
 threatened


military
 strikes
 there.
 Trump
 only
 spent


about
 three
 minutes
 talking
 about
 it,


though,
 and
 moved
 on
 with
 little


explanation
 of
 why
 he's
 ordered
 the


largest
 buildup
 of
 US
 military
 firepower


in
 the
 Middle
 East
 since
 the
 invasion
 of


Iraq.


Overall,
 the
 speech
 came
 at
 a
 critical


moment
 for
 Trump.
 His
 popularity
 is
 the


lowest
 it's
 been
 since
 he
 retook
 office,


and
 nationwide,
 his
 party
 is
 bracing
 for


potentially
 significant
 losses
 in
 the


upcoming
 midterms,
 which
 could
 make
 it


harder
 for
 Trump
 to
 enact
 his
 agenda.


Facing
 that
 possibility,
 Trump
 took


multiple
 opportunities
 throughout
 the


night
 to
 attack
 Democrats,
 calling
 them


crazy
 and
 anti-American
 and
 accusing


them
 of
 prioritizing
 undocumented


immigrants
 over
 US
 citizens.


Is
 the
 president
 working
 for
 you?


Meanwhile,
 after
 Trump's
 speech,
 is
 the


president
 working
 to
 make
 life
 more


affordable
 for
 you
 and
 your
 family?
 The


governor
 of
 Virginia,
 Abigail


Spanberger,
 gave
 the
 Democratic
 Party's


rebuttal.


>> He's
 enriching
 himself,
 his
 family,
 his


friends.
 The
 scale
 of
 the
 corruption
 is


unprecedented.


>> Spanberger
 argued
 that
 Trump
 has
 hurt


the
 economy,
 sowed
 chaos
 with
 his


policies,
 and
 personally
 benefited
 from


his
 presidency.
 It
 was
 a
 preview
 of
 the


messaging
 Democrats
 hope
 will
 resonate


with
 voters
 this
 fall.


This
 week,
 there's
 been
 a
 fresh
 series


of
 resignations
 and
 allegations
 stemming


from
 the
 Epstein
 files.
 Since
 the
 latest


batch
 of
 documents
 was
 released
 by
 the


Justice
 Department
 last
 month,
 the
 web


of
 prominent
 people
 connected
 to
 the


convicted
 sex
 offender
 has
 come
 into


clearer
 view,
 and
 a
 number
 of
 them
 are


facing
 new
 consequences.


In
 the
 UK,
 one
 of
 the
 country's
 best


known
 political
 figures,
 Peter


Mandlesson,
 was
 arrested
 on
 suspicion


that
 he
 shared
 government
 information


with
 Epstein.
 Mandlesson
 was
 fired
 from


his
 role
 as
 ambassador
 to
 the
 US
 last


year
 when
 the
 depth
 of
 his
 friendship


with
 Epste
 became
 public,
 but
 scrutiny


of
 him
 has
 been
 growing
 since
 the
 latest


files
 appear
 to
 show
 that
 he
 passed


along
 potentially
 confidential


government
 documents.
 Mandlesson
 has
 not


yet
 been
 charged
 with
 a
 crime
 and
 has


been
 released
 on
 bail.
 He
 previously


said
 that
 the
 Epstein
 files
 don't
 show


any
 wrongdoing
 on
 his
 part.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 in
 the
 US,
 the


high-profile
 health
 influencer
 Peter


Atia
 has
 resigned
 from
 his
 position
 as
 a


contributor
 to
 CBS
 News.
 He's
 also


stepped
 down
 from
 a
 top
 job
 at
 a
 protein


bar
 company.
 The
 files
 showed
 that
 Atia


and
 Epstein
 started
 meeting
 up
 and


writing
 to
 each
 other
 years
 after


Epstein
 pleaded
 guilty
 to
 prostitution


charges
 involving
 a
 minor.
 In
 one
 note,


Atia
 said
 he
 wished
 he
 could
 tell
 more


people
 about
 what
 he
 called
 Epstein's


outrageous
 life.
 And
 he
 also
 begged


Epstein
 to
 follow
 his
 medical


recommendations
 so
 that
 he
 could
 quote


keep
 up
 with
 the
 23-year-old
 beauties.


In
 a
 social
 media
 post
 earlier
 this


month,
 Atia
 said
 he
 was
 ashamed
 of
 that


correspondence
 and
 did
 not
 know
 about


Epstein's
 trafficking
 and
 abuse
 of
 women


or
 underage
 girls.


And
 at
 Columbia
 University,
 the
 Nobel


Prizewinning
 co-director
 of
 a
 flagship


scientific
 institute
 announced
 yesterday


that
 he's
 resigning.
 Richard
 Axel
 is
 not


accused
 of
 any
 wrongdoing,
 but
 the
 files


document
 his
 yearslong
 connection
 with


Epstein,
 including
 the
 fact
 that
 he
 was


a
 frequent
 guest
 at
 Epstein's
 Manhattan


home,
 and
 that
 he
 was
 a
 middleman


between
 Epstein
 and
 Colombia's


admissions
 and
 fundraising
 staff.
 It's


just
 one
 example
 in
 the
 files
 of
 how


Epstein
 tied
 himself
 to
 some
 of
 the


country's
 most
 prestigious
 universities


and
 celebrated
 academics.


Four
 years
 ago
 this
 week,


Russian
 troops,
 planes,
 and
 tanks


crossed
 the
 border
 into
 Ukraine,
 kicking


off
 a
 fullcale
 invasion.


>> These
 troops
 you
 can
 see
 over
 here,
 they


are
 Russian
 airborne
 forces.
 Now,
 after


years
 of
 brutal
 fighting,
 the
 two
 sides


are
 effectively
 deadlocked
 on
 the


battlefield
 and
 in
 ongoing
 peace
 talks.


In
 the
 negotiations
 brokered
 by
 the


Trump
 administration,
 Ukraine
 is


basically
 being
 offered
 a
 trade
 peace
 in


exchange
 for
 letting
 Russia
 keep
 the
 20%


of
 Ukrainian
 territory
 that
 it's
 managed


to
 seize.
 Russia
 is
 also
 demanding
 the


entirety
 of
 the
 Daetsk
 region,
 some
 of


which
 it
 hasn't
 taken
 control
 of
 yet.


While
 some
 Ukrainians
 worn
 down
 by
 near


daily
 attacks
 are
 open
 to
 that
 kind
 of


deal,
 it's
 much
 more
 complicated
 for
 the


people
 who
 live
 in
 the
 region
 in


question.
 My
 colleagues
 recently


traveled
 there
 to
 talk
 to
 the
 residents


who
 are
 caught
 in
 the
 middle.
 Much
 of


Donetsk
 has
 been
 destroyed,
 but
 they
 say


the
 city
 of
 Slovian,
 just
 miles
 from
 the


front
 lines,
 is
 kind
 of
 an
 eerie
 oasis.


Even
 with
 a
 constant
 soundtrack
 of


distant
 explosions,
 a
 bowling
 alley
 is


still
 open
 for
 business
 and
 there
 are


bustling
 coffee
 shops
 and
 Pilates


classes.
 The
 Times
 spoke
 with
 one
 woman


who
 opened
 a
 hair
 salon
 there
 two
 years


ago.
 It's
 her
 dream
 business,
 but
 she


said
 if
 Ukraine
 agrees
 to
 turn
 over


control
 of
 her
 city
 to
 Russia,
 then
 she


will
 leave.
 It's
 an
 agonizing
 choice


after
 sticking
 it
 out
 through
 years
 of


war.
 Another
 resident
 told
 the
 Times
 she


and
 the
 other
 people
 still
 living
 there


feel
 powerless
 and
 that
 all
 they
 can
 do


is
 quote
 hope
 we
 will
 not
 be
 given
 to


Russia.


Hi
 there.
 I'm
 coming
 on
 to
 say
 it
 is
 day


24
 since
 our
 mom


was
 taken
 in
 the
 dark
 of
 night
 from
 her


bed.
 In
 a
 new
 video,
 Savannah
 Guthrie,


one
 of
 the
 hosts
 of
 the
 Today
 Show,


announced
 that
 her
 family
 is
 offering
 up


to
 $1
 million
 for
 information
 that
 leads


to
 the
 return
 of
 her
 mother,
 Nancy,
 who


was
 abducted
 from
 her
 home
 outside


Tucson.


>> If
 you've
 been
 waiting
 and
 you
 haven't


been
 sure,
 let
 this
 be
 your
 sign
 to


please
 come
 forward,
 tell
 what
 you
 know,


and
 help
 us
 bring
 our
 beloved
 mom
 home.


In
 the
 weeks
 since
 Nancy
 Guthrie
 went


missing,
 authorities
 say
 that
 hundreds


of
 investigators
 from
 the
 local


sheriff's
 department
 and
 the
 FBI
 have


been
 assigned
 to
 the
 case,
 and
 they've


been
 sifting
 through
 tens
 of
 thousands


of
 tips.
 But
 so
 far,
 there
 has
 been
 no


breakthrough.
 And
 in
 the
 video,
 Guthrie


acknowledged
 that
 her
 mother,
 who's
 84


years
 old,
 may
 no
 longer
 be
 alive.
 The


Guthri's
 new
 million-doll
 offer
 is
 in


addition
 to
 two
 other
 $100,000
 rewards,


one
 from
 the
 FBI
 and
 another
 from
 an


Arizona
 based
 crime
 hotline.
 In
 the


video
 posted
 yesterday,
 Guthrie
 said
 her


family
 is
 also
 donating
 $500,000
 to
 the


National
 Center
 for
 Missing
 and


Exploited
 Children
 and
 that
 they
 hope


the
 intense
 focus
 on
 their
 case
 might


also
 bring
 more
 attention
 to
 other


missing
 people
 who
 don't
 have
 a


celebrity
 connection.


And
 finally,


>> school
 just
 started
 and
 the
 worst
 thing


possible
 just
 happened.
 I
 got
 a
 yonder


pouch.
 It
 basically
 locks
 your
 phone
 in


with
 a
 magnet.


>> Across
 the
 country,
 more
 than
 30
 states


require
 school
 districts
 to
 ban
 or


restrict
 students
 access
 to
 their
 cell


phones.
 And
 the
 company
 Yonder
 has
 built


itself
 as
 a
 solution.
 Yonder
 makes
 those


little
 pouches
 that
 you
 may
 have
 been


asked
 to
 tuck
 your
 phone
 into
 at
 a


concert
 or
 a
 show
 or
 a
 classroom.
 The


pitch
 goes
 that
 once
 it's
 in
 there,
 the


pouch
 blocks
 phone
 signals
 and
 it
 can't


be
 unlocked
 without
 a
 special
 device.


According
 to
 the
 company,
 3
 million


students
 use
 the
 pouches
 daily.
 And


according
 to
 a
 database
 that
 tracks


local
 government
 spending,
 Yonder
 made


at
 least
 $19
 million
 in
 sales
 to
 schools


last
 year
 alone.
 But


>> what's
 up
 guys?
 Today
 I'm
 going
 to
 show


you
 guys
 how
 to
 open
 up
 a
 lock
 yonder


pouch.


>> It
 turns
 out
 those
 pouches
 are
 no
 match


for
 kids.
 At


>> first
 I
 tried
 banging
 it
 and
 that
 didn't


work.
 So
 I
 banged
 it
 harder.


>> Some
 students
 say
 they
 found
 that
 if
 you


whack
 the
 pouches
 against
 a
 hard
 surface


at
 just
 the
 right
 angle,
 they
 spring


open.
 Some
 of
 them
 are
 even
 craftier.


They
 don't
 put
 their
 phones
 into
 the


pouches
 at
 all.
 They
 just
 tuck
 a
 decoy


device
 in
 or
 even
 a
 heavy
 rock.
 And
 then


there's
 the
 kids
 who
 figured
 out
 you


could
 potentially
 buy
 a
 magnet
 off


Amazon
 to
 unlock
 them.
 Given
 the
 reality


that
 kids
 just
 will
 figure
 out
 a


solution,
 some
 educators
 told
 the
 Times


they
 opt
 for
 a
 more
 lowfi
 approach,
 like


just
 making
 everyone
 leave
 their
 phone


at
 the
 front
 of
 the
 class.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy


Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
