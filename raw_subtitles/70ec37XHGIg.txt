When
 you
 look
 at
 our
 food
 system
 today,


majority
 of
 what
 people
 are
 eating
 is


ultrarocessed
 crap.
 The
 average
 child


spends
 less
 time
 outside
 than
 like
 a


maximum
 security
 prison
 where
 people
 are


spending
 eight
 plus
 hours
 on
 phone.
 We


are
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


problems
 in
 the
 country.
 If
 we
 don't
 fix


this,
 like
 America
 is
 going
 to
 have
 even


more
 serious
 problems.
 The
 environment


that
 we
 exist
 in
 is
 just
 structurally


just
 hard
 to
 be
 healthy,
 which
 is
 why


you
 see
 the
 default
 health
 outcomes
 in


the
 US
 being
 so
 poor.
 Why
 not
 just


universal
 basic
 ompic?
 Why
 doesn't
 that


solve
 the
 problem?


>> I
 think
 now
 the
 problem
 is
 we're
 feeding


our
 kids
 poison
 and
 like
 all
 of
 them
 are


sick.
 I
 think
 many
 of
 our
 problems
 are


downstream
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 majority


of
 the
 country
 is
 just
 sick.
 No
 matter


if
 we
 get
 rich
 or
 whatever,
 if
 most
 of


the
 country
 is
 sick,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


what
 is
 the
 point?


You've
 been
 on
 a
 quest
 for
 the
 last
 few


years
 to
 uncover
 and
 make
 a
 dent
 in


solving
 our
 food
 crisis,
 our
 health


crisis,
 our
 disease
 crisis.
 Why
 don't


you
 trace
 your
 journey
 a
 little
 bit
 into


how
 you
 became
 obsessed
 with
 this?
 Um,


and
 then
 we'll
 get
 into
 what
 we're
 up


to.
 Yeah.
 So,
 Peter
 Seal
 has
 this
 idea


of
 like
 a
 secret
 and
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 the


idea
 that
 what
 you
 eat,
 your
 lifestyle,


all
 these
 things,
 they
 impact
 your


health
 outcomes,
 they
 impact
 your


energy,
 they
 impact
 how
 you
 feel.
 Like,


I
 kind
 of
 came
 across
 that
 idea
 when
 I


was
 20
 and
 it
 felt
 like
 this
 secret


where,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 any
 data


in
 the
 US,
 US
 healthcare
 outcomes
 are


horrible.
 Like,
 they're
 bad,
 they're


getting
 worse.
 Like,
 obesity,
 you
 know,


heart
 disease,
 all
 of
 these
 conditions


are
 basically
 at
 record
 levels
 and


continue
 to
 go
 up.
 And
 as
 I
 started
 to


read
 more
 about
 our
 food
 system,
 about,


you
 know,
 uh,
 environmental
 toxins,


about
 all
 these
 sorts
 of
 things,
 like
 I


just
 became
 more
 and
 more
 convinced
 that


the
 everyone's
 like,
 "What's
 going
 on


with
 our
 obesity
 crisis?
 Why
 are
 we
 so


sick?"
 And
 the
 answer
 is
 just
 like


simply
 that
 we
 exist
 in
 an
 environment


that
 systematically
 outputs
 unhealthy


people.
 And
 that
 this
 this
 idea
 that
 you


could
 just
 change
 your
 food,
 change
 your


diet,
 change
 your
 exercise,
 change
 your


environment
 and
 that
 would
 lead
 to
 to


much
 better
 health
 outcomes
 naturally


feels
 to
 me
 like
 this
 secret
 that
 you


know
 I
 believed
 and
 invested
 behind
 and


like
 started
 companies
 behind
 for
 15


years
 uh
 that
 still
 like
 the
 average


person
 does
 not
 totally
 fully
 like


internalize.
 Uh
 and
 so
 it
 was
 just
 like


I
 just
 became
 obsessed
 with
 this
 idea
 uh


the
 first
 time
 I
 came
 across
 it
 when
 I


was
 like
 20
 or
 so.
 and
 you
 yourself
 have


gone
 out
 of
 your
 way
 to
 um
 go
 against


this
 the
 the
 grain
 in
 terms
 of
 your
 own


personal
 life
 and
 trying
 to
 be
 healthy


but
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 be
 healthy


today.
 It
 it's
 almost
 like
 people
 used


to
 say
 when
 they
 were
 cancelling
 people


on
 on
 Twitter
 all
 the
 time
 like
 hey
 just


build
 your
 own
 Twitter
 like
 just
 you


want
 your
 own
 information
 you
 could
 just


build
 your
 own
 and
 similarly
 like
 you


have
 to
 build
 your
 own
 like
 food


totally.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean
 in
 so
 many
 ways
 I


feel
 like
 the
 things
 like
 health
 used
 to


just
 be
 an
 output
 of
 the
 environment


that
 we
 existed
 in.
 Like
 my
 my
 great-g


grandandmother
 you
 know
 she
 lived
 till


she
 was
 95
 very
 healthy
 until
 the
 day


that
 she
 died.
 And
 she
 never
 shopped


organic.
 She
 never
 like
 avoided
 and


asked
 for
 no
 seed
 oils
 at
 the
 grocery


store.
 She
 never
 did
 like
 any
 of
 the


insanity
 that
 I've
 kind
 of
 had
 to
 learn,


figure
 out,
 and
 do.
 Uh
 that's
 because


primarily
 she
 in
 lived
 and
 grew
 up
 in
 an


environment
 that
 was
 not
 sickness


promoting.
 She
 was
 not
 exposed
 to
 like


40,000
 novel
 chemical
 compounds
 that


exist
 in
 the
 US
 or
 eating
 foods
 that


were
 like
 addictive
 and
 made
 her
 feel


shitty
 and
 and
 like
 impacted
 her
 health.


Uh,
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that
 the
 environment


that
 we
 exist
 in
 is
 just
 structurally


just
 hard
 to
 be
 healthy,
 which
 is
 why


you
 see
 the
 default
 health
 outcomes
 in


the
 US
 being
 so
 poor.
 And
 how
 are
 the


Amish
 exempt
 from
 this?
 Just
 as
 an


example,
 like
 what
 do
 they
 do


differently?


>> They
 do
 I
 mean
 they
 do
 a
 lot


differently.
 You
 should
 go
 to
 one
 of
 the


communities.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 things


they
 do
 very
 differently
 than
 you
 and
 I.


Uh,
 but
 basically
 they're
 eating,
 you


know,
 food
 that
 is
 grown
 locally,


seasonally
 all
 the
 time.
 They're
 outside


all
 the
 time
 working
 with
 their
 hands.


They're
 existing
 in
 a
 tight-knit


community.
 uh
 you
 know
 they
 and
 there's


like
 a
 whole
 host
 of
 environmental
 and


lifestyle
 uh
 differences
 that
 the
 Amish


have.
 Uh
 so
 you
 can
 argue
 like
 is
 it
 a


100
 you
 know
 do
 you
 have
 to
 live
 like


the
 Amish
 to
 have
 better
 health


outcomes?
 But
 certainly
 they
 have
 much


better
 health
 outcomes
 and
 they
 live


very
 differently
 than
 you
 or
 I


>> but
 they're
 not
 doom
 scrolling
 like
 us.


So
 how
 do
 they
 make
 it?
 It's
 like
 they


might
 live
 longer.


>> They're
 uninformed.
 I
 know
 they
 might


live
 longer
 but
 at
 what
 cost?


Um
 so


when
 did
 things
 start
 to
 get
 really
 bad


or
 like
 like
 um
 has
 it
 just
 been


monotonically
 for
 the
 last
 century
 or


was
 there
 sort
 of
 a
 moment
 where
 things


started
 to
 escalate
 and
 and
 what


happened?


>> Yeah,
 things
 started
 to
 get
 much
 worse


in
 the
 1970s.
 Uh
 you
 know
 basically
 I


think
 my
 my
 view
 is
 that
 that
 is
 around


the
 time
 when
 you
 started
 to
 see


childhood
 obesity
 tick
 up.
 You
 started


to
 see
 uh
 obesity,
 heart
 disease,
 things


like
 this
 kind
 of
 start
 to
 move.
 And
 in


my
 view,
 a
 big
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 there


was
 a
 lot
 of
 shareholder
 and
 other


pressure
 uh
 specifically
 geared
 towards


big
 food
 companies
 around
 that
 time


where
 basically
 these
 companies
 are


today
 like
 150
 years
 old.
 Almost
 every


big
 food
 company
 is
 shareholder
 owned.


They
 are
 not
 run
 controlled
 or
 anything


by
 CEOs.
 They're
 basically
 just
 like


these
 lumbering,
 you
 know,
 corporations


that
 the
 market
 is
 just
 optim
 having


them
 optimized
 for
 like
 earnings
 per


share.
 And
 what
 that
 means
 is
 these


companies
 for
 the
 last
 50
 years
 have


consistently
 decided
 to
 trade
 a
 real


ingredient
 for
 something
 that's
 like


kind
 of
 a
 fake
 version
 of
 that.
 Like


they've
 moved
 from
 strawberries
 to


strawberry
 flavoring
 or
 they've
 moved


from
 sugar
 to
 high
 fructose
 corn
 syrup.


And
 you
 kind
 of
 roll
 this
 out
 over
 a


50-year
 period
 and
 you
 you
 look
 at
 our


food
 system
 today
 and
 the
 majority
 of


what
 people
 are
 eating
 is
 ultrarocessed


crap
 that
 is
 like
 addictive,
 is
 not


nutrient-dense,
 and
 is
 full
 of
 like


environmental
 toxins,
 chemical


compounds,
 um
 you
 know,
 things
 like
 this


that
 the
 human
 body
 has
 in
 our
 entire


millions
 of
 years
 of
 evolution
 never


encountered
 many
 of
 these
 compounds.
 And


so
 I
 think
 that
 that
 shift
 started
 in


the
 70s.
 Um
 you
 know,
 it's
 compounded


generationally.
 Uh
 it
 certainly
 doesn't


help
 today
 that
 the
 average
 child
 spends


less
 time
 outside
 than
 like
 a
 maximum


security
 prisoner.
 Uh
 you
 know
 like
 most


kids
 today
 are
 eating
 like
 70%
 of
 their


diet
 is
 ultrarocessed
 foods.
 Uh
 you
 know


people
 are
 spending
 eight
 plus
 hours
 on


phones.
 Like
 all
 these
 sorts
 of
 things


are
 factors
 but
 I
 really
 think
 that
 our


food
 system
 started
 to
 become
 uniquely


poisonous
 in
 the
 70s
 and
 that
 is
 why
 you


saw
 especially
 in
 the
 US
 that's
 why
 you


started
 to
 see
 many
 healthcare
 and


health
 outcomes
 trend
 in
 such
 a
 negative


direction
 especially
 relative
 to
 the


rest
 of
 the
 world.
 What
 are
 the
 levers


that
 could
 uh
 make
 a
 dent
 in
 in


reversing
 some
 of
 these
 trends
 as


relates
 to
 the
 to
 the
 food
 system?


>> Yeah,
 from
 a
 food
 system
 standpoint,
 I


think
 the
 biggest
 single
 lever
 that
 we


could
 pull,
 which
 would
 be


extraordinarily
 politically
 challenging


to
 pull,
 is
 fixing
 our
 like
 crop
 subsidy


system.
 So,
 if
 you
 look,
 the
 US


government
 over
 the
 last
 uh
 I
 think
 it's


the
 last
 decade
 has
 spent
 close
 to
 like


a
 hundred
 billion
 on
 crop
 subsidies.


They're
 basically
 subsidizing
 corn,
 soy,


and
 wheat
 uh
 so
 that
 American
 farmers


can
 grow
 corn,
 soy,
 and
 wheat.
 because


it's
 subsidized,
 it's
 artificially


cheap,
 so
 we
 grow
 a
 lot
 of
 it.
 Because


it's
 subsidized,
 it's
 artificially


cheap.
 And
 so
 these
 big
 food
 companies


use
 it
 in
 everything.
 And
 so
 these
 big


food
 companies
 have
 basically
 gone
 on


like
 a
 30-year
 journey
 to
 replace
 sugar


with
 high
 fructose
 corn
 syrup
 or
 to


replace
 um
 olive
 oil
 or
 something
 like


that
 with
 soybean
 oil,
 which
 is
 highly


processed
 and
 inflammatory,
 causes


obesity
 and
 all
 sorts
 of
 like
 rat
 and


human
 models.
 Um,
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that


this
 sort
 of
 wholesale
 swapping
 of
 like


let's
 take
 the
 the
 worst
 ingredients
 in


their
 most
 highly
 processed
 form
 and


replace
 them
 with
 an
 ingredient
 um
 that


that
 humans
 traditionally
 ate
 is
 one
 of


the
 root
 causes
 of
 chronic
 disease.
 Like


today,
 the
 average
 American
 gets
 almost


20%
 of
 their
 caloric
 intake
 from
 soybean


oil.
 Like
 this
 is
 historically


anomalous.
 And
 it's
 not
 because
 anyone


wants
 soybean
 oil.
 Like
 you're
 probably


not
 like
 a
 big
 consumer
 of
 soybean
 oil


or
 anything
 like
 this.
 It's
 just
 because


it's
 artificially
 cheap.
 And
 because


it's
 artificially
 cheap,
 it
 ends
 up
 in


everything.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 one


of
 the
 core
 kind
 of
 root
 causes
 of
 what


is
 going
 wrong
 in
 our
 food
 system
 today.


>> And
 is
 that
 a
 uniquely
 US
 problem
 or
 is


this


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 uniquely
 US
 problem.
 I


mean,
 the
 US,
 our
 food
 system
 relative


to
 like
 Europe
 or
 something
 like
 that.


Uh
 Europe,
 many,
 you
 know,
 their


countries
 are
 smaller.
 Uh
 they
 tend
 to


lean
 much
 more
 into
 like
 a
 local
 food


agriculture
 system.
 They
 also
 don't
 have


as
 much
 of
 a
 like
 federal
 intervention


on
 their
 food
 system.
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 US


like
 in
 many
 ways
 this
 sort
 of
 subsidy


of
 corn,
 soy,
 wheat,
 things
 like
 that.


It
 had
 good
 intent.
 I
 mean
 in
 the
 a
 lot


of
 this
 the
 crop
 subsidy
 stuff
 uh


started
 with
 a
 farm
 bill
 in
 the
 80s


where
 basically
 like
 farmers
 were


exposed
 to
 inclement
 weather,
 bad


weather
 that
 was
 like
 impacting
 their


their
 crop
 yields.
 The
 US
 government


stepped
 in
 and
 was
 like,
 "Okay,
 we're


going
 to
 try
 and
 keep
 these
 farmers


solvent."
 Um,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 intent


was
 good,
 but
 now
 here
 we
 are
 like
 years


later,
 we
 have
 billions
 a
 year
 going


towards
 these
 crop
 subsidies
 that
 are


making
 Americans
 sick.
 And
 I
 think
 that


we
 used
 to
 say,
 okay,
 we
 just
 need
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we're
 growing
 enough


calories
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 Americans


are
 not
 dying
 of
 starvation.
 They're
 not


like,
 you
 know,
 make
 sure
 our
 kids
 have


enough
 to
 eat.
 I
 think
 now
 the
 problem


is
 like
 we're
 feeding
 our
 kids
 poison


and
 like
 all
 of
 them
 are
 sick.
 Why
 not


just
 universal
 basic
 ompic?
 I
 mean,


what's
 what's
 it
 why
 doesn't
 that
 solve


the
 problem?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 two


things.
 One,
 I
 think
 that
 GLP1s
 are


potentially
 an
 incredibly
 interesting


technology.
 Like
 I
 I
 think
 that
 we
 are


in
 the
 midst
 of
 the
 the
 worst
 chronic


disease
 crisis,
 one
 of
 the
 biggest


problems
 in
 the
 country.
 And
 if
 we
 don't


fix
 this,
 like
 America
 is
 going
 to
 have


even
 more
 serious
 problems
 like
 20
 years


from
 now.
 So
 given
 that,
 given
 that
 the


average
 American
 is
 overweight,
 we're


looking
 at
 almost
 80%
 obesity
 over
 rate


overweight
 rates.
 I
 think
 that
 it
 does


make
 sense
 to
 put
 a
 bunch
 of
 these


people
 on
 a
 GLP-1
 to
 try
 and
 jumpstart


them
 in
 a
 direction
 where
 they
 are


moving
 towards
 health.
 Uh
 that
 said,
 I


don't
 at
 all
 think
 that
 giving
 universal


GLP1s
 to
 everyone
 is
 like
 necessarily
 a


universal
 solve.
 Like
 the
 there's
 just
 a


very
 poor
 history
 of
 saying
 here
 is
 an


intervention
 that
 like
 is
 going
 to
 solve


all
 of
 our
 problems
 as
 a
 species.
 uh
 you


know
 and
 and
 I
 just
 think
 that
 it
 is


quite
 unlikely
 that
 ompic
 is
 the
 one


thing
 that
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 cure
 all


like
 just
 to
 use
 one
 example
 what
 is
 you


know
 how
 does
 ompic
 work
 uh
 is
 it


basically
 it
 it
 turns
 down
 someone's


appetite
 so
 you're
 just
 eating
 less
 if


you're
 still
 eating
 the
 same
 crap
 uh


that
 the
 average
 American
 is
 eating


today
 but
 you're
 on
 ompic
 and
 eating


less
 of
 it
 like
 you
 are
 almost
 certainly


going
 to
 be
 deficient
 in
 protein
 and


micronutrients
 and
 a
 bunch
 of
 things


that
 will
 have
 like
 long-term
 health


implications
 uh
 if
 you
 like
 undereat
 or


get
 exposed
 to
 not
 enough
 of
 those


nutrients
 for
 a
 very
 long
 period
 of


time.
 So
 I
 think
 we
 fundamentally
 like


have
 to
 solve
 the
 food
 issue
 if
 we
 want


to
 have
 a
 healthy
 country.


>> By
 the
 way,
 have
 we
 yet
 updated
 our
 food


pyramid
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 we
 have
 an


accurate
 understanding
 of
 what
 we
 should


be
 getting
 on
 a
 on
 a
 country
 level
 in


terms
 of
 nutrients?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 new
 food
 pyramid
 is


a
 tremendous
 improvement
 over
 over
 the


old
 guidelines.
 I
 mean,
 not
 only
 is
 the


site
 super
 sexy,
 you
 know,
 Joe
 Gibbia


did
 a
 great
 job
 on
 that,
 uh,
 but


finally,
 for
 the
 first
 time,
 people
 are


saying
 like,
 "Eat
 whole
 foods,
 eat
 more


vegetables,
 eat,
 you
 know,
 meats
 and


like
 other
 other
 wells
 sourced
 sources


of
 protein,
 vegetables,
 fruits."
 It's


crazy
 that
 it
 took
 until
 now
 to
 say


maybe
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 giving
 kids,
 you


know,
 15
 servings
 of
 whole
 grain
 and


saying
 that
 like
 sugar
 is
 totally
 fine


for
 kids
 under
 two.
 Like
 we
 recommend


some
 amount
 of
 sugar
 for
 kids
 on
 the
 age


of
 two.
 uh
 which
 was
 the
 past
 you
 know


past
 administration
 sort
 of
 guidelines.


So
 I
 think
 they're
 a
 tremendous


tremendously
 positive
 step.


>> And
 so
 for
 people
 who
 want
 to
 make
 a


difference
 in
 in
 the
 food
 system
 you
 you


mentioned
 that
 policy
 recommendation.


What
 about
 people
 who
 want
 to
 do


something
 direct?
 You
 obviously
 you
 know


before
 True
 you
 started
 a
 a
 bone
 broth


company.
 What
 are
 other
 big
 companies


that
 could
 be
 built
 uh
 in
 the
 space
 or


or
 opportunities
 to
 to
 make
 a


difference?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 ton
 of


opportunities.
 I
 mean
 within
 the
 space


that
 I
 like
 I
 think
 the
 core
 problem
 is


that
 a
 bunch
 of
 these
 lifestyle


interventions
 like
 eating
 a
 healthier


diet,
 exercising,
 uh
 taking
 certain


supplements,
 taking
 like
 peptides
 if


that
 makes
 sense
 for
 for
 your
 sort
 of


individual
 person
 and
 risk
 profile.
 All


of
 these
 things
 can
 be
 considered


healthcare
 interventions.
 And
 yet
 if
 you


look
 at
 our
 healthare
 system,
 nothing
 in


the
 healthare
 system
 thinks
 about


someone
 who
 is
 at
 risk
 of
 heart
 disease


exercising
 as
 a
 healthcare
 intervention.


No
 payer
 pays
 for
 it.
 No
 one


incentivizes
 you
 to
 do
 that.
 It's
 just


sort
 of
 like
 a
 doctor
 is
 like,
 "Yeah,


you
 should
 like
 clean
 up
 your
 diet
 and


exercise."
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 there
 is


a
 tremendous
 tremendous
 opportunity
 for


people
 that
 want
 to
 make
 a
 dent
 on
 this


problem.
 Uh
 figuring
 out
 how
 to
 make


these
 sorts
 of
 lifestyle
 interventions


part
 of
 the
 healthare
 system
 is
 what


we're
 doing
 at
 Trummed.
 Uh
 and


incentivizing
 people
 to
 actually
 invest


in
 their
 health,
 to
 invest
 in


prevention,
 uh
 to
 invest
 in
 things
 that


like
 move
 the
 needle
 from
 a
 chronic


disease
 standpoint.


>> Yeah.
 So
 let's
 get
 to
 True
 Med
 first.


first
 trace
 the
 idea
 maze
 a
 little
 bit


in
 terms
 of
 you
 know
 you
 you've
 been


obsessed
 with
 with
 this
 this
 problem


this
 kind
 of
 meta
 problem
 this
 series
 of


problems
 and
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 where
 do


you
 even
 start
 I'm
 sure
 you
 you
 know


picked
 over
 every
 nook
 and
 cranny
 um
 how


did
 you
 settle
 that
 hey
 this
 was
 the


opportunity
 what
 was
 maybe
 some
 other


things
 you
 consider
 yeah
 so
 in
 in


growing
 uh
 kettle
 and
 fire
 basically


when
 we
 launched
 it
 was
 like
 $16
 a


carton
 for
 16
 ounces
 of
 bone
 broth
 and


everyone
 was
 like
 this
 is
 good
 but
 this


is
 like
 very
 expensive
 and
 you
 know
 now


9
 years
 in
 we're
 in
 every
 grocery
 store


in
 the
 country
 and
 the
 average
 price
 per


box
 is
 like
 $7.
 Uh
 people
 way
 more


people
 buy
 it,
 but
 they're
 also
 like


this
 is
 very
 expensive.
 Uh
 I
 kind
 of


like
 had
 that
 experience
 and
 then
 looked


at
 things
 like
 Costco
 and
 Walmart
 are


the
 two
 largest
 sellers
 of
 organic


products
 in
 the
 country.
 To
 me,
 that
 is


a
 signal
 that
 like
 people
 want
 to
 invest


in
 products
 that
 are
 good
 for
 them.
 They


want
 to
 buy
 products
 that
 leave
 them
 off


better,
 healthier,
 and
 the
 like,
 but


it's
 just
 cost
 prohibitive.
 And
 then
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 healthare
 system,
 we


have
 this
 weird
 dynamic
 where
 if
 I
 am
 at


risk
 of
 cardiovascular
 disease
 or
 heart


disease,
 like
 I
 basically
 can
 exercise,


I
 can
 eat
 well,
 uh
 I
 can
 do
 all
 of
 these


things
 that
 will
 prevent
 an
 acute
 heart


attack
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and
 I'm


basically
 not
 that's
 all
 like
 cash
 pay.


I'm
 paying
 out
 of
 pocket.
 I'm
 doing
 all


of
 that
 kind
 of
 stuff
 totally
 on
 my
 own.


Whereas
 if
 you
 take
 someone
 that
 doesn't


do
 any
 of
 those
 things,
 basically
 they


have
 a
 heart
 attack
 early
 and
 then
 the


health
 care
 system
 will
 pay
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 or
 millions
 of
 dollars
 to


manage
 that
 person's
 condition
 basically


for
 the
 rest
 of
 their
 lives.
 And
 so
 I


think
 that
 fundamentally
 like
 we
 need
 to


incentivize
 people
 to
 invest
 in


prevention
 to
 invest
 in
 you
 know


leveraging
 lifestyle
 interventions
 that


can
 make
 a
 dent
 on
 chronic
 conditions.


Um
 and
 that
 was
 kind
 of the
 lens
 through


which
 I
 was
 looking
 at
 what's
 the


company
 that
 I
 want
 to
 start
 after


Kettle
 and
 Fire.
 When
 I
 met
 um
 Dr.
 Mark


Kimman
 who
 is
 basically
 you
 know
 he's
 a


functional
 medicine
 doctor
 co-founder
 of


function
 he
 mentioned
 that
 something
 he


was
 doing
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 his
 patients


was
 for
 patients
 that
 would
 come
 in
 he


would
 recommend
 lifestyle
 interventions


and
 he
 would
 write
 them
 something
 called


a
 letter
 of
 medical
 necessity
 which
 is


basically
 a
 letter
 that
 the
 IRS
 has
 said


uh
 for
 certain
 people
 where
 an


intervention
 matches
 uh
 matches
 like
 a
 a


lifestyle
 intervention
 matches
 a


condition
 someone's
 working
 to
 treat


reverse
 or
 prevent
 um
 they
 can
 spend


they
 can
 get
 that
 letter
 and
 use
 taxfree


HSA
 FSA
 dollars
 on
 sleep
 aids,
 healthy,


you
 know,
 better
 diet,
 uh,
 supplements,


exercise,
 things
 like
 that.
 And
 so
 when


Markman
 told
 us
 kind
 of
 about
 that
 idea,


I
 was
 like,
 this
 is
 a
 really
 interesting


thing.
 like
 we
 could
 basically
 try
 and


build
 infrastructure
 that
 allows
 the


average
 person
 to
 get
 one
 of
 these


elements
 if
 they
 qualify
 uh
 and
 use
 like


the
 tele
 medicine
 rails
 that
 Himsow
 and


other
 companies
 have
 spent
 the
 last


several
 years
 building
 but
 rather
 than


prescribing
 ompic
 or
 prescribing
 TRT
 we


can
 actually
 prescribe
 food


interventions
 exercise
 things
 like
 that.


Uh
 so
 that
 was
 kind
 of the
 kind
 of
 the


idea
 and
 like
 where
 it
 started
 from.
 Uh,


I
 looked
 at
 a
 whole
 host
 of
 other
 things


like
 thought
 about
 starting
 a
 grocery


store.
 Uh,
 thought
 about
 starting
 like
 a


life
 insurance
 company
 that
 would
 be


aggressive
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 helping
 you


live
 longer
 and
 making
 lifestyle


interventions.
 Um,
 but
 ultimately
 felt


like
 this
 was
 the
 type
 of
 thing
 that
 had


the
 potential
 to
 direct
 hundreds
 of


billions
 of
 dollars
 towards
 lifestyle


interventions
 over
 the
 next
 couple


years.
 Uh,
 and
 so
 it
 felt
 like
 it
 was
 it


was
 the
 right
 thing
 to
 do.
 So
 yeah,


everyone
 knows
 we
 need
 to
 shift
 more,


you
 know,
 from
 chronic
 to
 to
 preventive


care
 and
 and
 this
 is
 basically
 a
 way
 to


financially
 incentivize
 people
 to
 do


that.


>> Exactly.


>> Yeah.


>> Exactly.


>> What
 one
 of
 your
 your
 ideas
 is
 that
 the


the
 root
 cause
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 issues
 is


this
 mismatch
 between
 our
 genes
 and
 our


environment.
 Why
 don't
 you
 flesh
 that


out
 a
 little
 bit
 more?


>> Yeah.
 So
 if
 you
 look
 like
 think
 of
 a
 an


animal
 in
 the
 zoo
 like
 you
 an
 animal
 in


the
 wild
 with
 few
 exceptions
 like
 they


can
 get
 break
 their
 leg
 get
 an
 infection


whatever
 but
 when
 an
 animal
 is
 like


exists
 in
 a
 species
 appropriate


environment
 that
 animal
 tends
 to
 be


healthy
 like
 there's
 a
 natural
 match


between
 the
 the
 health
 of
 the


environment
 and
 the
 health
 of
 an
 animal.


When
 you
 take
 an
 animal
 away
 from
 its


natural
 habitat
 and
 put
 it
 in
 the
 zoo
 or


something
 like
 that,
 like
 zoo
 animals


exhibit
 all
 of
 these
 diseases
 that
 their


counterparts
 in
 the
 wild
 just
 don't
 get.


They
 have
 weird
 ticks,
 they
 get


depressed.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 in
 some
 notable


cases,
 like
 animals
 have
 even
 killed


themselves,
 which
 is
 just
 something
 you


like
 don't
 see
 in
 the
 wild.
 Um,
 and
 they


get
 obese,
 they
 get
 all
 sorts
 of
 things.


And
 so
 my
 my
 take
 and
 what
 I
 think
 is


very
 true
 is
 that
 the
 health
 of
 an


animal
 is
 basically
 a
 reflection
 of
 the


health
 of
 an
 animal's
 environment.
 If
 an


animal
 is
 existing
 in
 an
 environment


that
 is
 not
 healthpromoting,
 like
 you're


in
 a
 season
 of
 drought
 or
 there's
 not
 a


lot
 of
 food,
 that
 animal
 gets
 skinny,


dies,
 like
 you
 you
 basically
 can
 kind
 of


see
 that
 that
 that
 animal
 is
 not


existing
 in
 an
 environment
 that's


healthpromoting.
 I
 think
 that
 over
 the


last
 100
 years
 or
 so,
 we
 basically
 as


humans
 have
 have
 seen
 uh
 you
 know,
 we've


built
 an
 environment
 that
 is
 not


considering
 or
 not
 underwriting,
 not


thinking
 about
 what
 is
 the
 right
 thing


to
 do
 for
 human
 health.
 Like
 how
 do
 we


promote
 human
 health
 and
 and


flourishing?
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that
 so


often
 when
 we
 think
 about
 health,
 we


think
 about
 like
 what
 is
 going
 on
 with


you,
 Eric,
 with
 this
 specific
 condition


as
 opposed
 to
 thinking
 about
 what
 is
 the


environment
 that
 you
 exist
 in
 that
 leads


to
 you
 not
 getting
 8,000
 steps
 a
 day


that
 leads
 to
 you
 spending
 all
 day
 on


your
 phone
 that
 leads
 to
 you
 like
 eating


a
 a
 a
 terrible
 diet.
 No,
 I'm
 not,
 you


know,
 not
 you
 actually,
 but
 I
 mean,
 uh,


so,
 so
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 like
 an


important
 idea
 that
 people
 don't
 think


about
 enough
 is
 just
 how
 do
 you
 shape


your
 environment
 so
 that
 it's
 naturally


healthpromoting
 as
 opposed
 to,
 uh,
 you


know,
 having
 to
 like
 discipline
 yourself


and
 doing
 all
 the
 stuff
 that
 most
 people


frankly
 fail
 at,
 myself
 included.


There's
 this
 uh,
 you
 know,
 there's
 this


Twitter
 competition
 for
 a
 million


dollars
 for
 who
 gets
 the
 best
 article.


And
 there's
 this
 like
 uh
 so
 people
 are


doing
 kind
 of
 clickbait
 stuff
 and


there's
 one
 guy
 who's
 like
 uh
 you
 know


how
 to
 change
 your
 life
 in
 a
 day,
 how
 to


change
 your
 life
 in
 an
 hour,
 like
 these


kinds
 of
 posts.
 And
 there
 was
 one
 that


went
 super
 viral
 that
 was
 how
 to
 change


your
 life
 in
 1
 minute
 and
 it
 was
 a
 photo


of
 smashing
 the
 phone.


That's
 pretty
 good.
 Totally.
 the
 um
 okay


so
 I'm
 curious
 for
 more
 um
 you
 know
 you


you've
 talked
 about
 this
 idea
 of
 hey
 we


should
 take
 this
 health
 crisis
 as


serious
 as
 we
 take
 sort
 of
 our
 you
 know


national
 security
 crisis
 like
 you
 know


we
 as
 a
 country
 have
 something
 of
 a
 NRA


for
 health
 or
 or
 something
 of
 a
 you
 know


collective
 effort
 because
 it's
 a
 it's
 a


you
 know
 problem
 that
 hey
 the
 market


might
 not
 isn't
 solving
 on
 its
 own
 and


in
 fact
 you
 know
 exacerbates


>> what
 would
 um
 you
 know
 you
 gave
 one


example
 of
 uh
 and
 the
 subsidies
 What
 are


some
 of
 the
 biggest
 levers
 you
 think?


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 I'll
 answer
 that,
 but
 like


just
 to
 frame
 how
 I
 think
 about
 the


problem,
 you
 know,
 if
 if
 for
 example


like
 China
 or
 one
 of
 our
 adversaries


deployed
 a
 boweapon
 that
 made
 75%
 of
 our


population
 obese
 or
 overweight,
 45%
 of


kids
 obese
 or
 overweight,
 like
 and
 and


healthcare
 like
 the
 the
 largest
 cost
 in


the
 country
 all
 of a
 sudden
 because


everyone
 was
 sick,
 everyone
 in
 America


would
 be
 up
 in
 arms
 and
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 like
 how
 do
 we
 solve
 this?
 This
 is


an
 existential
 crisis.
 this
 is
 like
 a


matter
 of
 national
 security
 that
 we
 make


a
 dent
 on
 that.
 You
 know,
 no
 matter
 if


we
 win
 the
 a
 I
 race,
 get
 rich
 or


whatever.
 If
 most
 of
 the
 country
 is


sick,
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 what
 is
 the


point?
 You
 know,
 we're
 not
 thriving
 as
 a


nation.
 I
 think
 many
 of
 our
 political


problems
 are
 downstream
 of
 the
 fact
 that


many
 the
 majority
 of
 the
 country
 is
 just


sick.
 And
 so,
 if
 I
 was
 like
 able
 to
 wave


a
 magic
 wand
 and
 do
 anything,
 I
 think


fixing
 the
 subsidies
 would
 be
 one
 thing


for
 sure
 that
 I
 would
 do.
 Um
 secondly,
 I


would
 have
 our
 health
 care
 system
 just


invest
 far
 more
 in
 prevention.
 Uh
 you


look
 at
 other
 countries
 that
 have


incredible
 like
 health
 outcomes
 on
 a
 per


capita
 basis.
 Uh
 Singapore
 is
 a
 good


example.
 They
 basically
 have
 these


people
 that
 are
 not
 quite
 doctors
 but


are
 are
 like
 coaches
 or
 something
 like


that
 that
 will
 check
 in
 with
 you
 and
 try


and
 like
 nudge
 you
 towards
 making
 better


better
 choices.
 uh
 then
 I
 I
 would
 take
 a


much
 stronger
 stance
 one
 much
 much
 more


similar
 to
 that
 that
 Europe
 takes
 um


when
 it
 comes
 to
 like
 certain


environmental
 toxins,
 chemical


regulation,
 things
 like
 that.
 Like
 in


the
 US,
 we
 basically
 take
 the
 approach


that
 if
 a
 company
 makes
 or
 manufactures


a
 totally
 novel
 environmental
 chemical


that
 as
 long
 as
 they
 tell
 us
 under


current,
 you
 know,
 regulations,


something
 called
 grass
 generally


recognized
 as
 safe.
 as
 long
 as
 they
 tell


us,
 hey,
 this
 chemical
 is
 safe,
 we
 can


introduce
 it
 into
 our
 food
 system.
 Uh


this
 is
 how
 like
 you've
 heard
 of
 the


forever
 chemicals
 and
 stuff
 like
 this


got
 into
 our
 food
 system
 and
 basically


are
 all
 over
 the
 planet
 now.
 Uh
 because


3M
 invented
 them
 something
 like
 60
 years


ago
 and
 basically
 they
 just
 started


using
 them.
 uh
 in
 the
 EU,
 these
 novel


chemical
 compounds
 have
 to
 go
 through


something
 that
 is
 much
 more
 like
 what
 it


takes
 to
 like
 unleash
 or
 uh
 you
 know
 get


a
 pharmaceutical
 approved
 in
 the
 in
 the


US
 today
 where
 they
 have
 to
 do
 many


years
 of
 safety
 testing.
 They
 have
 to


show
 that
 it
 doesn't
 cause
 acute
 harm.


Uh
 and
 they
 basically
 have
 to
 approve
 it


before
 it's
 allowed
 on
 the
 market.
 And


the
 the
 end
 result
 is
 we
 have
 between


like
 60
 and
 80,000
 chemical
 compounds
 in


the
 US
 that
 are
 not
 allowed
 in
 in
 the


EU.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 that
 regulatory


approach
 is
 one
 of
 like
 the
 hidden


reasons
 why
 so
 many
 people
 are
 sick.
 And


I
 think
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 that,


you
 know,
 the
 the
 US
 uh
 Americans
 are


exposed
 to
 more
 toxic
 compounds
 and


novel
 chemical
 compounds
 than
 basically


any
 nation
 in
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 I
 think


that
 is
 like
 a
 big
 kind
 of
 hidden
 part


of
 our
 chronic
 disease
 crisis.
 And
 it's


something
 you're
 going
 to
 hear
 a
 lot


more
 about
 in
 the
 coming
 years.


>> Yeah.
 Fascinating.
 I
 had
 one
 college


professor.
 I
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 if
 this
 is


even
 remotely
 accurate,
 but
 they
 were


they
 were
 convinced
 that
 Monsanto
 was


evil.
 Um,
 not
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 its
 uh,


you
 know,
 health
 impacts,
 but
 they


thought
 they
 thought
 they
 were
 sort
 of


like
 getting
 involved
 in
 all
 sorts
 of


foreign
 wars
 and
 like
 influencing
 our


foreign
 policy
 and
 stuff.
 And
 I
 just
 say


that
 to
 say
 could
 there
 be
 competitors


to
 some
 of
 these
 like
 mega
 play
 like


could
 startups
 even
 emerge
 that
 would


begin
 to
 or
 is
 it
 just
 like
 structurally


unsound?
 I
 think
 it's
 really
 hard


structurally
 and
 I
 think
 that
 that


doesn't
 mean
 that
 it's
 not
 going
 to


happen
 and
 hopefully
 it
 will
 but
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 you
 have
 seen
 is
 with


Monsanto
 for
 example
 like
 the
 the


pesticide
 lobby
 and
 the
 the
 chemical
 and


a
 lobby
 is
 one
 of
 the
 strongest
 in


America
 and
 a
 big
 part
 of
 what
 they're


doing
 is
 like
 for
 example
 a
 couple


months
 ago
 uh
 Monsanto
 was
 lobbying
 hard


spent
 tens
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars
 to
 get


a
 a
 writer
 in
 a
 bill
 that
 would


basically
 make
 sure
 that
 no
 one
 could


ever
 sue
 them
 for
 the
 potential
 health


impacts
 of
 one
 of
 their
 most
 popular


products,
 glyphosate.
 Uh
 that
 sort
 of


thing
 is
 like
 these
 companies
 get
 big,


they
 provide
 a
 bunch
 of
 chemicals.


Monsanto
 specifically
 has
 done
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 think
 are


incredibly
 like
 morally
 dubious.
 Um
 and


and
 then
 once
 they
 get
 big
 enough,
 once


they
 like
 start
 selling
 billions
 and


billions
 of
 dollars
 of
 these
 products,


they
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 that
 money
 on


lobbying
 and
 making
 sure
 that
 they
 are


immune
 from
 any
 of
 the
 harms
 and
 health


impacts
 uh
 that
 come
 from
 some
 of
 the


some
 of
 these
 like
 toxic
 products
 that


they
 spray
 everywhere.
 uh
 like


glyphosate
 is
 the
 number
 one
 pesticide


sprayed
 in
 the
 US
 and
 the
 largest
 maker


of
 it
 is
 spending
 as
 much
 as
 they


possibly
 can
 to
 make
 sure
 that


glyphosate
 which
 you
 know
 there's
 been


14
 billion
 of
 damages
 awarded
 to
 people


that
 have
 gotten
 cancer
 or
 other


diseases
 from
 glyphosate
 exposure.


Monsanto
 is
 spending
 as
 much
 as
 they
 can


to
 try
 and
 like
 buy
 basically
 pesticide


liability
 shields
 and
 other
 things
 that


shield
 them
 from
 competition
 and
 or
 that


shield
 them
 from
 the
 actions
 and
 the


consequences
 of
 like
 the
 diseases
 their


compounds
 have
 caused.
 Uh
 I
 think
 that


when
 when
 these
 companies


can
 kind
 of
 rig
 the
 game
 in
 that
 way,
 it


becomes
 very
 very
 challenging
 for
 a


startup
 to
 kind
 of
 come
 along
 and
 make
 a


real
 play
 at
 some
 of
 these
 things.


>> Yeah.
 You
 mentioned
 a
 grocery
 store
 just


as
 a
 simple
 idea.
 Is
 there
 what's
 the


opportunity
 that
 Whole
 Foods
 hasn't
 done


with
 with
 with
 what
 they've
 tried
 to
 do?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 Whole
 Foods
 is
 amazing
 and


so
 uh
 I
 think
 that
 John
 Mackey
 was
 like


a
 total
 pioneer
 and
 like
 legendary


entrepreneur.
 I
 think
 that
 the
 thing


that
 grocery
 stores
 have
 not
 really
 done


is
 and
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 thesis
 for


Trummed
 is
 like
 think
 about
 food
 as
 like


a
 healthcare
 intervention.
 And
 to
 me,
 I


think
 there's
 a
 ton
 of
 potential
 for


people
 to,
 for
 example,
 like
 look
 at


their
 biomarkers
 and
 have
 a
 grocery


store
 or
 some
 other
 entity
 that
 is


responsible
 for
 improving
 your
 health.


Like
 I
 think
 that
 if
 you
 think


increasingly
 about
 food,
 grocery
 as
 a


health
 intervention,
 as
 like
 part
 of


one's
 healthare
 and
 you
 know
 part
 of
 the


fight
 against
 chronic
 disease,
 you
 would


think
 about
 a
 grocery
 very
 a
 grocery


store
 very
 differently
 than
 today
 which


is
 basically
 just
 like
 let's
 figure
 out


the
 sourcing
 and
 then
 people
 can
 buy


whatever
 they
 want.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think


there's
 like,
 you
 know,
 my
 idea
 was
 that


I
 think
 there's
 a
 ton
 of
 room
 for
 a


grocery
 store
 that
 is
 a
 more
 active


participant
 in
 your
 in
 your
 health,


telling
 you
 to
 eat
 certain
 things,
 you


know,
 tracking
 your
 macros,
 like
 all


these
 sorts
 of
 things
 that
 I
 think
 would


solve
 a
 lot
 of
 problems
 for
 people.


Yeah.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 more
 about
 if
 we,


you
 know,
 fully
 identified
 the
 health


crisis
 as
 one
 of
 our
 main
 sort
 of


national
 priorities,
 what
 what
 else
 we


would
 do?
 Maybe
 we
 could
 start
 looking


at
 it
 in
 the
 light
 of
 like
 what
 were


some
 of
 the
 pillars
 or
 main
 principles


and
 maybe
 talk
 about
 where
 they
 are
 so


far.
 Yeah.
 Uh
 so
 I
 think
 that
 you
 have


seen
 across
 all
 of
 healthcare,
 across


all
 of
 food,
 just
 corporate
 capture
 of


our
 food
 guidelines,
 of
 our
 health


guidelines,
 of
 all
 these
 sorts
 of


things.
 Like
 the
 previous
 FDA


commissioner,
 uh
 you
 know,
 their
 stated


goal
 with
 running
 the
 FDA,
 their
 number


one
 goal
 was
 to
 combat
 misinformation.


The
 current
 one
 is
 to
 like
 make


Americans
 healthy.
 That
 means
 grass


reform,
 so
 cleaning
 up
 like
 how
 we


regulate
 chemicals.
 Uh
 that
 means
 fixing


school
 lunches,
 fixing
 like
 military


lunches.
 Basically
 what
 we
 feed
 kids,


you
 know,
 80%
 of
 schools
 have
 contracts


with
 soda
 companies.
 These
 soda


companies
 literally
 like
 will
 pay
 a


school
 district
 to
 put
 these
 vending


machines
 all
 over
 the
 schools.
 It
 helps


fund
 schools,
 but
 it
 also
 like
 comes
 at


the
 cost
 of
 getting
 kids
 sick.
 Um
 so
 I


think
 like
 cleaning
 up
 school
 lunches,


cleaning
 up
 military
 lunches,
 uh


cleaning
 up
 like
 the
 food
 guidelines.


Second
 thing
 is
 like
 improving
 and


streamlining
 the
 way
 that
 we
 look
 at


regulating
 drugs.
 make
 it
 faster
 for


companies
 to
 like
 lean
 in
 and
 launch


innovative
 therapies
 that
 can
 make
 a


dent
 on
 the
 chronic
 disease
 crisis.
 Uh,


and
 just
 trying
 to
 like
 bring
 common


sense
 back
 into
 the
 way
 that
 we
 think


about
 health,
 the
 way
 that
 we
 think


about
 food,
 uh,
 and
 try
 and
 make
 a
 dent


in
 the
 chronic
 disease
 crisis.
 are
 are


some
 of
 these
 ingredients
 that
 we're


we're
 discussing
 or
 or
 or
 foods
 or
 or


you
 know
 soda
 or
 what
 like
 so
 d
 so so


addicting
 or
 so
 dangerous
 or
 so


appeasing
 that
 they
 should
 be
 outlawed


or
 so
 like
 how
 do
 we
 think
 about


>> No
 I
 I
 actually
 don't
 think
 that
 many
 of


these
 things
 should
 be
 outlawed
 like
 I
 I


do
 actually
 think
 that
 consumer
 choice


is
 a
 very
 important
 thing
 um
 you
 know


but
 we
 have
 like
 specifically
 with
 kids


we
 have
 guidelines
 and
 we
 already
 don't


think
 that
 kids
 should
 have
 free
 choice


like
 we
 don't
 let
 them
 drink
 so
 I
 think


that
 there
 is
 a
 place
 for
 soda
 in
 this


country
 I
 just
 also
 think
 that
 if
 you


want
 to
 drink
 soda
 all
 the
 time
 that


probably
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 subsidizing
 it


by
 subsidizing
 high
 fructose
 corn
 syrup.


Probably
 we
 should
 not
 have
 Coca-Cola


spending
 $140
 million
 to
 influence
 our


our
 nutrition
 guidelines
 like
 they
 have


over
 the
 last,
 you
 know,
 15
 years.
 Uh


and
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 things
 like
 that


where
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 the
 big
 food


companies
 and
 people
 will
 sort
 of
 fall


back
 on
 this
 idea
 of
 consumer
 choice.
 I


think
 it's
 very
 important
 but
 we
 also


are
 like
 currently
 grappling
 with
 an


incredibly
 important
 chronic
 disease


crisis
 and
 like
 if
 we
 don't
 take
 effort


to
 uniquely
 like
 address
 this
 thing
 I


think
 that
 the
 US
 is
 like
 in
 an


incredibly
 tough
 spot
 10
 20
 30
 years


from
 now.
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about


psychedelics
 um
 and
 I'm
 like
 is
 that
 in


this
 discourse
 at
 all?
 Does
 that
 move


outcomes
 for
 is
 that
 kind
 of
 not
 really


not
 really?


I
 think
 that
 if
 you
 just
 look
 at
 the


data,
 psychedelics
 are
 an
 incredibly


powerful
 intervention.
 Like
 ketamine


therapy,
 ketamine
 assisted
 therapy
 works


better
 than
 SSRIs
 in
 many
 cases,


especially
 for
 treating
 things
 that
 are


very
 intense
 like
 treatment
 resistant


depression,
 PTSD,
 things
 like
 this.
 Um,


I
 think
 that
 for
 many
 of
 our
 veterans


and
 others
 that
 suffer
 from
 PTSD
 and


like
 intense
 depression,
 psychedelics


should
 be
 part
 of
 a
 menu
 of
 treatments


that
 we
 like
 are
 open
 to
 giving
 people.


uh
 you
 know
 I
 I
 think
 that
 we
 probably


vastly
 underinvest
 in
 them.
 I
 think
 that


there's
 a
 ton
 of
 really
 promising


research
 around
 their
 efficacy
 and


things
 like
 this.
 Um
 I
 think
 it's
 an


open
 question
 of
 like
 how
 ready
 the


average
 American
 is
 to
 think
 about
 these


things
 not
 as
 like
 a
 group
 of
 people


dropping
 acid
 in
 Golden
 Gate
 Park
 in
 the


60s
 but
 as
 like
 a
 vital
 mental
 health


therapy
 for
 people
 that
 are
 really


really
 struggling.
 I'm
 very
 supportive


of,
 you
 know,
 again,
 just
 looking
 at


psychedelics
 as
 another
 therapy
 that
 can


address
 the
 many
 mental
 health
 and


depression
 issues
 that
 we
 have
 in
 this


country.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 just
 as


that
 through
 that
 lens,
 a
 therapy
 that


has
 few
 to
 no
 side
 effects,
 um,


especially
 when
 done,
 you
 know,
 with


doctor
 oversight
 and
 things
 like
 this,
 I


think
 they
 should
 be
 part
 of
 how
 we


treat
 and
 address
 many
 of
 the
 mental


health
 crises
 that
 we
 see
 today.


>> Yeah.


Are
 there
 any
 other
 really
 big
 levers


that
 you
 would
 focus
 on
 if
 if
 if
 one
 of


your
 main
 goals
 was
 to
 target
 the
 mental


health
 crisis?


>> I
 think
 that
 we
 are
 hugely


underestimating
 the
 impact
 of
 uh


biological
 health
 and
 how
 that
 is
 tied


to
 mental
 health.
 Like
 there's
 some


really
 interesting
 studies
 out
 there


around
 taking
 a
 functional
 medicine


approach
 where
 you
 know
 you
 come
 in
 and


say
 you're
 depressed
 and
 rather
 than


like
 doing
 talk
 therapy
 and
 things
 like


this
 that
 statistics
 show
 like
 sort
 of


don't
 work
 very
 well
 for
 many
 people.
 uh


we
 focused
 just
 on
 like
 reducing
 your


inflammation
 and
 fixing
 your
 gut.
 Uh
 and


there
 have
 been
 studies
 that
 show
 just


by
 focusing
 and
 taking
 a
 functional


medicine
 approach
 uh
 you
 know
 focusing


on
 sleep,
 focusing
 on
 gut
 health,


focusing
 on
 lowering
 your
 inflammation


through
 diet
 and
 exercise
 that


combination
 of
 therapies
 works
 better


than
 you
 know
 just
 talk
 therapy
 and


things
 like
 that.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 we


massively
 under
 underestimate
 the
 degree


to
 which
 we
 are
 you
 know
 human
 beings.


for
 our
 biological
 organisms
 and
 like


our
 mental
 health
 is
 very
 tightly


coupled
 to
 our
 emotional
 um
 you
 know


sorry
 to
 our
 physical
 health
 and
 so
 I


would
 have
 much
 I
 think
 that
 we
 should


fund
 much
 much
 more
 of
 research
 along


these
 lines
 of
 what's
 called
 metabolic


psychiatry
 uh
 which
 is
 basically
 this


idea
 that
 many
 diseases
 that
 we
 put
 in


the
 mental
 health
 bucket
 thing
 like


epilepsy
 depression
 uh
 schizophrenia


many
 of
 these
 things
 have
 causes
 that


are
 actually
 metabolic
 in
 root
 and
 like


for
 example
 one
 of
 the
 best
 therapies


for
 someone
 that
 is
 schiz
 schizophrenic


or
 epileptic
 or
 even
 in
 many
 cases


bipolar.
 If
 you
 put
 them
 on
 a
 ketogenic


diet,
 these
 things
 will
 in
 many
 cases


just
 resolve.
 That
 is
 not
 a
 thing
 that


our
 current
 like
 mental
 health


world
 really
 underwrites.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 It
 reminds
 me
 of
 a


conversation
 I
 once
 had
 with
 Daniel


Gross
 when
 he
 he
 was
 saying,
 "Hey,


anytime
 someone
 is
 feeling
 depressed,
 it


would
 behoove
 them
 to,
 you
 know,
 before


attributing
 it
 to
 some
 psychological,


you
 know,
 defect
 or
 making
 some
 deep


psycho,
 you
 know,
 analysis
 about
 it,


first
 just
 saying,
 hey,
 am
 I
 sleeping


well?
 Am
 I
 eating
 well?
 Am
 I


exercising?"


>> Totally.
 Have
 I
 been
 outside
 recently?


Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Totally.
 the
 um
 I
 want
 to
 shift


lastly
 to
 another
 topic
 um
 that
 you've


just
 been
 really
 curious
 about
 um
 for
 a


while
 which
 is
 which
 is
 consciousness.


Um
 what
 what
 has
 sort
 of
 your
 driven


your
 your
 hunch
 or
 or
 curiosity
 there


and
 and
 and
 where
 is
 your
 thinking
 drawn


you?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that
 I
 have
 just
 been


interested
 in
 this
 idea
 of
 like
 what


what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 be
 healthy?
 What


does
 it
 mean
 to
 live
 a
 life
 that
 people


are
 like
 excited
 about,
 have
 energy


with,
 you
 know,
 have
 energy
 and
 are
 just


like
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 like
 feel


great
 in
 your
 body
 and
 your
 in
 your
 mind


and
 everything?
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 that


consciousness
 is
 sort
 of
 this
 root
 layer


of
 like
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 what
 is


your
 experience
 of
 being
 alive
 of of
 of


life?
 Uh,
 and
 frankly
 like
 we
 don't


really
 have
 a
 great
 answer
 to
 this
 right


now.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 a


lot
 of
 our
 theories
 and
 philosophies
 and


things
 of
 like
 what
 is
 consciousness
 are


are
 not
 great.
 they're
 not
 predictive


and
 and
 you
 ask
 the
 average
 person,
 you


ask
 even
 like
 philosophers
 that
 have


thought
 a
 lot
 about
 this.
 Um,
 and


there's
 not
 there's
 nothing
 near


consensus.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 I
 don't


it
 is
 an
 area
 that
 I'm
 very
 interested


in.
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 learn
 a
 lot


about
 in
 the
 next
 decade.
 I
 hope
 to
 like


have
 friends
 and
 like
 play
 somewhat
 of
 a


role
 in
 like
 exploring
 and
 learning
 more


about
 uh
 about
 what
 consciousness
 is,


like
 how
 to
 change
 it,
 how
 to
 improve


it,
 you
 know,
 all
 these
 sorts
 of
 things.


Um
 but
 yeah,
 I
 would
 put
 it
 very
 much
 in


like
 personal
 pet
 interest
 bucket.
 Uh


not
 like
 I'm
 doing
 anything
 around
 it


right
 now.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 to
 obviously
 you're
 focused


on
 building
 True
 Med,
 we'll
 close
 there.


But
 if
 if
 you
 could
 scale
 yourself,
 you


know,
 infinitely
 like
 for
 people


listening
 who
 are
 like
 also
 obsessed


with
 this
 problem.
 Is
 is
 there
 something


else
 you
 think
 is
 underexplored
 under


whether
 it's
 a
 research
 area
 or
 a


company
 idea
 or
 or or
 or
 some
 sort
 of


policy
 thing
 that
 not
 enough
 people
 are


looking
 into
 that
 we
 haven't
 yet


discussed
 that
 you
 want
 more
 people
 to


spend?


>> Yeah.
 An
 idea
 I've
 been
 thinking
 about


recently
 is
 uh
 like
 and
 we
 mentioned
 at


the
 beginning
 that
 the
 health
 of
 an


organism
 is
 like
 the
 health
 of
 your


environment.
 And
 in
 my
 view,
 what
 that


means
 is
 that
 if
 we
 started
 thinking


about
 not
 improving
 just
 Eric's
 health,


but
 improving
 the
 health
 of
 like
 all
 of


your
 friends
 and
 community
 and
 people


around
 you
 that
 exist
 in
 the
 same


environment,
 like
 in
 in
 intervening
 and


improving
 your
 environment
 could
 have
 a


much
 larger
 impact
 on
 health
 than
 just


like
 optimizing
 your
 own
 health.
 And
 so


I
 think
 that
 there's
 like
 potentially


interesting
 models
 of
 improving
 one's


environment,
 whether
 that's
 building


like
 a
 health
 oriented
 city
 or
 town
 or


like
 suburb,
 you
 know,
 development
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Um
 whether
 that's


like
 group
 health
 insurance
 for
 people


that
 are
 deciding
 to
 live
 differently


and
 like
 make
 have
 different


interventions
 uh
 and
 invest
 in
 in
 sort


of
 like
 root
 cause
 lifestyle


interventions.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


interesting
 things
 that
 could
 come
 about


when
 you
 start
 thinking
 about
 health


through
 the
 lens
 of
 a
 community
 or
 like


tens
 hundreds
 of
 people,
 not
 just


through
 the
 lens
 of
 like
 me
 as
 an


individual.
 So,
 if
 I
 had
 copies
 of


myself,
 I
 would
 I
 would
 explore


companies
 in
 that
 in
 that
 direction.


Yeah,
 I
 love
 that.
 Let's
 um
 let's
 close


on
 on
 on
 True
 Med
 and
 and
 go
 deeper
 into


it
 in
 the
 sense
 of
 we're
 obviously
 uh


the
 company's
 done
 phenomenally.
 We're


obviously
 very
 lucky
 to
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of


it.
 um
 say
 more
 for
 for
 for
 people
 who


are
 not
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 the
 actual


product
 and
 and
 uh
 and
 the
 direction
 in


terms
 of
 where
 it's
 going.


>> Sure.
 Yeah.
 So,
 TRMED
 uh
 basically
 what


it
 is
 is
 we
 for
 people
 that
 qualify,
 we


allow
 them
 to
 spend
 uh
 taxfree
 HSA
 and


FSA
 dollars
 on
 things
 that
 treat,


reverse,
 and
 prevent
 disease
 that
 fall


within
 like
 the
 lifestyle
 intervention


category.
 So
 like
 we're
 partners
 with


eight
 sleep,
 we're
 partnered
 with


Pelaton,
 we're
 partnered
 with
 Momentous


Lifetime
 Lifetime
 Fitness.
 All
 of
 these


brands
 that
 you
 know
 for
 someone
 that
 is


working
 at
 treat
 versus
 prevent
 heart


disease
 or
 obesity
 or
 things
 like
 this,


these
 lifestyle
 interventions
 are


healthcare.
 And
 so
 we've
 built
 a
 payment


integration
 that
 allows
 people
 to
 spend


their
 taxfree
 HSA
 dollars
 on
 these


interventions
 um
 and
 are
 scaling
 that


up.
 Like
 I
 think
 that
 where
 this
 can
 go


over
 the
 next
 decade
 is
 every
 American


that
 is
 at
 risk
 or
 has
 some
 sort
 of


chronic
 condition
 should
 be
 incentivized


and
 taxfree
 money
 is
 a
 great
 incentive


to
 spend
 their
 own
 money,
 their
 dollars


on
 things
 that
 treat,
 reverse
 or
 prevent


disease.
 And
 there's
 no
 mechanisms
 in


today's
 health
 care
 system
 for
 someone


to
 actually
 spend
 uh
 you
 know
 for


someone
 to
 get
 like
 a
 gym
 membership
 for


cheaper
 than
 the
 list
 price
 or
 to
 get
 a


gym
 membership
 covered
 uh
 by
 their


employer
 by
 an
 insurance
 provider
 like


that.
 Uh
 and
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 the
 thing


the
 way
 that
 I
 think
 about
 what
 we're


building
 is
 building
 infrastructure
 that


allows
 people
 and
 incentivizes
 them
 to


invest
 in
 lifestyle
 interventions
 to


save
 off
 and
 prevent
 different
 chronic


conditions.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 and
 I
 actually
 I
 have
 to
 ask
 u


what
 are
 your
 thoughts
 on
 peptides
 and


any
 predictions
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 Oh
 man,


I
 think
 peptides
 are
 going
 to
 be
 so


disruptive
 to
 our
 current
 healthare


system.
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 that
 if
 you


look
 at
 peptides,
 uh
 there
 needs
 to
 be


way
 more
 research.
 I'm
 like
 not
 totally


yet
 a
 peptide
 believer.
 Uh
 but
 there


needs
 to
 be
 way
 more
 research,
 but
 from


early
 early
 signs
 and
 even
 just
 like
 NF1


people
 taking
 these
 things
 and
 using


them,
 uh
 this
 seems
 like
 a
 class
 of


compounds
 that
 are
 very
 effective.
 uh


they
 are
 not
 patentable.
 Um
 you
 know


like
 you
 can
 basically
 buy
 these
 for


fairly
 cheap
 and
 I
 would
 put
 them
 in
 the


bucket
 of
 like
 human
 enhancement


companies
 like
 our
 current
 health
 care


system
 and
 most
 of
 our
 pharmaceuticals


are
 kind
 of
 like
 don't
 die
 like
 oh


here's
 a
 statin
 like
 don't
 die
 take
 this


pill.
 Uh
 I
 think
 that
 the
 pep
 these


peptides
 are
 in
 a
 different
 class
 where


many
 of
 them
 are
 like
 give
 you
 more


energy,
 improve
 your
 sex
 drive,
 lower


your
 inflammation,
 improve
 your
 gut


health.
 Like
 they're
 just
 a
 different


category
 of
 compound.
 And
 I
 think
 that


as
 many
 people
 start
 to
 experiment
 with


them
 and
 try
 them
 and
 things
 like
 this,


you're
 going
 to
 see
 like
 really


interesting
 positive
 healthcare,
 you


know,
 um
 outcomes
 from
 a
 class
 of


compounds
 that
 like
 no
 one
 has
 thought


about
 for
 for
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 I


think
 it's
 gonna
 be
 exceptionally


disrupt
 disruptive
 to
 pharma
 and
 to
 like


a
 bunch
 of
 other
 players
 in
 the
 health


health
 care
 system.


>> And
 I'm
 also
 curious
 for
 you
 or
 just
 or


collectively
 like
 are
 we
 learning
 more


about
 um
 you
 know
 optimizing
 our


nutrition?
 You
 you
 got
 into
 the
 the
 rape


diet
 uh
 or
 you
 were
 writing
 about
 it.


What
 what
 what
 are
 your
 thoughts
 there


more
 broadly?
 I
 think
 the
 nutrition


science
 is
 probably
 among
 the
 worst
 of


the
 sciences
 uh
 in
 the
 US
 right
 now.
 You


know,
 most
 of
 nutrition
 science
 is


funded
 by
 a
 big
 food
 company.
 Uh
 they


outfund
 the
 NAH,
 like
 11
 to1
 on


nutrition
 science,
 at least


historically.
 That's
 hopefully
 changing.


Um
 I
 think
 that
 there
 are
 all
 of
 these


different
 diet
 tribes
 out
 there.
 The
 the


Peters,
 the
 Ray
 Pete
 crowd,
 I
 think,
 is


one
 that's
 particularly
 interesting


that's
 focused
 on
 like
 ramping
 up
 your


metabolism.
 Um
 but
 I
 think
 that
 for
 for


many
 people,
 you
 should
 just
 kind
 of
 try


and
 experiment
 with
 the
 diet
 that
 where


you
 feel
 good.
 like
 we
 now
 have
 lab


tests
 that
 you
 can
 get,
 you
 know,
 via


function
 or
 something
 like
 that
 to
 show


how
 does
 this
 diet
 impact
 your
 energy,


your
 biomarkers,
 things
 like
 this.
 You


have
 wearables
 that
 can
 actually
 give


you
 feedback
 around
 how
 is
 your
 sleep,


how's
 your
 HRV,
 how's
 your
 resting
 heart


rate,
 uh
 since
 switching
 your
 diet
 or


since
 doing
 things
 differently.
 And
 I


think
 that
 that
 combination
 of
 like


getting
 insight
 into
 how
 these
 things


are
 actually
 making
 you
 feel
 uh
 and
 how


they're
 impacting
 your
 biomarkers
 means


that
 people
 should
 be
 just
 way
 more
 open


to
 experimenting
 and
 seeing
 like
 hey


I'll
 try
 a
 peing
 diet
 for
 like
 90
 days


and
 just
 see
 how
 I
 feel.
 Uh
 so
 I'm
 I'm


very
 bullish
 on
 like
 people
 doing
 end
 of


one
 dietary
 like
 exploration
 and


experimentation.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 the


peing
 community
 is
 like
 probably
 the


most
 interesting
 one
 out
 there
 for
 me


right
 now.
 Um,
 and
 and
 why
 is
 that?


Because
 there
 is
 like
 two
 schools
 of


thought
 basically.
 There's
 like
 the


Brian
 Johnson
 school
 of
 thought,
 which


is
 we've
 done
 all
 the
 research.
 We
 know


that
 you
 need
 to
 eat
 a
 plant-based
 diet.


We
 know
 that
 you
 need
 to
 do
 caloric


restriction
 all
 in
 the
 name
 of


longevity.
 Um,
 that
 is
 like
 the
 current


dogma
 in
 many
 ways.
 The
 Peters
 are
 the


exact
 opposite.
 And
 you
 know, and
 Brian


Johnson
 would
 say
 like
 sugar
 is
 bad.
 You


should
 not
 eat
 carbohydrates,
 all
 this.


The
 Peters
 are
 like
 you
 should
 eat
 as


much
 sugar
 as
 you
 possibly
 can,
 mostly


in
 the
 form
 of
 like
 honey
 and
 fruit
 and


stuff
 like
 this.
 Um,
 you
 should
 try
 and


avoid
 like
 hugely
 avoid
 seed
 oils,


hugely
 avoid
 things
 that
 are
 going
 to


impair
 your
 metabolism.
 But
 if
 Brian


Johnson
 is
 like,
 I
 want
 to
 eat
 less
 and


ramp
 down
 my
 metabolism,
 it
 means
 I
 can


live
 longer.
 The
 Peters
 are
 like,
 ramp


it
 up
 as
 much
 as
 you
 can.
 And
 like
 the


more
 energy
 you
 have,
 the
 longer
 you
 are


able
 to
 use
 that
 energy
 over
 a
 long


period
 of
 time.
 Uh
 and
 so
 it
 is
 like


such
 a
 contrarian
 view
 to
 100
 years
 of


nutrition
 dogma
 that
 says
 sugar
 is
 bad


should
 be
 avoided
 that
 I
 think
 it's
 a


very
 interesting
 idea
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 the


people
 in
 the
 peing
 community
 have
 seen


phenomenal
 results
 like
 I
 I've
 started


drinking
 orange
 juice
 and
 like
 eating


fruit
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 like
 I
 feel


great
 and
 my
 biioarkers
 have
 gotten
 even


better
 from
 you
 know
 I've
 been
 doing


probably
 a
 decade
 plus
 of
 like
 mostly


low
 carb
 kind
 of
 paleo
 and
 so
 it's
 just


a
 very
 interesting
 different
 lens
 that


is
 worth
 playing
 with.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 no,


essentially
 I'll
 have
 to
 check
 out
 the


Peters.
 You
 know,
 Brian
 Johnson's


obviously
 been
 so
 interesting
 on
 so
 many


topics.
 One
 question
 I
 I
 was
 curious
 if


if
 I,
 you
 know,
 if
 I
 get
 a
 girlfriend,


should
 I
 make
 a
 launch
 video?


>> Um,
 Justin,
 uh,
 the
 company
 is
 True
 Med.


Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on
 the


podcast.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> Lucky
 to
 be
 involved.
