All
 right,
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back.
 It's


all
 in
 at
 Davos.
 My
 bestie,
 David
 Saxs,


is
 here.
 We're
 having
 a
 great
 time.


We're
 here.


>> Can
 you
 guys
 catch
 this
 in
 the


background?
 Amazing.


>> It's
 stunning.


>> This
 is
 the
 Davos
 experience.
 It
 looks


real.
 I
 know.
 Well,
 it
 kind
 of
 looks


like
 a
 green
 screen
 from
 here
 cuz
 it's


just
 so
 picturesque.


>> It's
 literally
 like
 a


>> green
 screen.
 It
 is.
 It's
 the
 real
 the


real
 deal.


>> And
 we'll
 we'll
 look
 over
 the
 ledge


here.
 And
 what
 you'll
 see
 is
 all
 of
 the


virtue
 signaling
 ESG
 DEI
 executives.
 And


uh
 you'll
 you'll
 just
 it's
 emanating


from
 this
 entire
 area.
 And
 they've
 put


solar
 over
 every
 single
 building
 here.


None
 of
 it's
 plugged
 in.
 It's
 just
 for


aesthetics.
 But
 uh
 we're
 really
 excited,


David
 and
 I,
 um
 to
 do
 a
 bunch
 of


interviews
 here.
 Wow.
 Today
 we've
 got
 a


great
 one
 for
 you.
 And
 we're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 health
 and
 we're
 going
 to


talk
 about
 the
 health
 care
 system
 with


none
 other
 than
 Dr.
 Midas.
 Uh
 you're
 the


administrator
 now
 for
 CMS.
 You've
 gone


from
 being
 America's
 doctor,
 dare
 I
 say,


to
 being
 a
 civil
 servant
 like
 my
 friend


David
 Saxs.
 Why
 did
 you
 choose
 really


height
 of
 your
 powers
 career
 to
 to
 go


into
 public
 service
 like
 this?


>> So,
 I'm
 in
 the
 change
 business.
 You
 guys


are
 as
 well.
 And
 if
 you're
 in
 the
 change


business
 and
 the
 project
 you're
 pursuing


is
 not
 making
 a
 significant
 change,
 then


you
 want
 to
 move
 on
 to
 something
 else


that
 could
 make
 the
 impact
 you
 desire.


And
 especially
 in
 healthcare,
 we
 don't


have
 the
 luxury
 of
 fooling
 around
 for


years
 of
 our
 lives
 pursuing
 uh
 interests


that
 don't
 result
 in
 meaningfully


changing
 the
 the
 quality
 of
 life,
 but


also
 the
 opportunity
 that
 the
 American


people
 have.
 And
 so
 although
 I
 loved


being
 a
 TV
 host,
 did
 it
 for
 13
 years,
 I


love
 practicing
 surgery,
 which
 I've
 done


my
 whole
 life
 till
 recently.
 Uh
 this
 is


the
 best
 job
 I've
 ever
 had.
 And
 it's
 the


best
 job
 I've
 had
 because
 of
 the
 people


that
 I
 get
 to
 work
 with,
 but
 also


because
 you
 truly
 do
 get
 to
 make
 the


change
 that
 I
 desire.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 folks,
 the
 reason
 they
 watch
 the


podcast
 is
 they
 they
 want
 to
 change


stuff,
 too.
 And
 I
 encourage
 everybody


to,
 you
 know,
 take
 some
 big
 swings
 and


you'll
 break
 things
 once
 in
 a
 while.
 But


if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 change


meaningfully
 the
 the
 infrastructure,


whatever's
 bothering
 you,
 uh,
 you
 got
 to


go
 at
 full
 speed.
 And
 this


administration
 offers
 us
 a
 unique


opportunity
 to
 do
 that.
 It
 is


interesting,
 David.
 Um,
 you
 were
 used
 to


going
 at
 a
 pretty
 fast
 pace
 as
 well.
 And


then
 I
 think
 our
 expectation
 was,
 hey,


you
 get
 into
 public
 service,
 it's
 going


to
 be
 about
 consensus
 building
 and
 it's


going
 to
 take
 a
 lot
 of
 time.
 Say
 what


you
 will
 about
 Trump.
 Some
 people
 might


not
 agree
 with
 every
 policy,
 but
 he


ships.
 He's
 like
 a
 founder
 who
 ships
 and


ships
 product
 fast.
 That's
 also
 been


your
 experience.


>> Yeah,
 he's
 hard
 to
 keep
 up
 with.
 I
 mean,


he
 moves
 incredibly
 fast
 and
 it
 makes


him
 really
 fun
 to
 work
 for
 because
 he


wants
 to
 get
 things
 done.


>> Yeah.


>> Every
 day
 he
 wants
 to
 get
 things
 done.


>> There's
 a
 sense
 of
 urgency.


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 know,
 you'll
 be
 in
 a


meeting
 with
 the
 president
 in
 the
 Oval


Office
 and
 you'll
 tell
 him
 about
 a


problem.
 His
 first
 instinct
 is
 to
 pick


up
 the
 phone


>> and
 call
 and
 fix
 it
 right
 then
 and


there.


>> And
 he
 does
 that
 meeting
 after
 meeting,


hour
 after
 hour,
 day
 after
 day,
 week


after
 week.
 And
 when
 you
 compound
 that


desire
 to
 get
 things
 done
 and
 he
 acts
 on


it
 right
 there,
 it
 has
 a
 huge
 impact.


and
 he
 seems
 to
 get
 great
 pleasure
 in


bringing
 together
 especially
 in
 this


administration
 which
 I
 think
 is


distinctly
 different
 than
 the
 first


first
 administration
 he
 was
 new
 to


politics
 and
 he
 brought
 in
 a
 lot
 of


career
 politicians
 that
 I
 think
 maybe


people
 told
 him
 were
 the
 right
 people


this
 time
 he
 has
 explicitly
 gone
 and


looked
 for
 people
 with
 expertise
 who
 are


proven
 winners
 in
 the
 field
 yourself


included


>> he
 wants
 us
 to
 carry
 the
 water
 and
 this


I
 think
 across
 the
 different
 parts
 of


the
 administ
 ministration.
 He
 wants


individuals
 that
 don't
 have
 to
 rely
 on


the
 president
 to
 tell
 the
 story
 all
 the


time
 because
 so
 much
 of
 the
 narrative


that
 is
 reflected
 in
 the
 media
 is
 just


completely
 off.
 I'm
 not
 even
 saying
 that


they're
 doing
 it
 on
 purpose.
 They


literally
 don't
 understand
 some
 of
 the


secondary
 and
 tertiary
 impact
 of
 the


decisions
 you're
 making.
 And
 it's
 our


job
 to
 therefore
 tell
 not
 just
 the


media,
 but
 the
 American
 people
 what


we're
 trying
 to
 do.
 And
 that's


especially
 important
 if
 you're


unorthodox
 in
 how
 you
 govern.
 And
 this


is
 a
 fundamentally
 important
 reality,
 at


least
 at
 CMS.
 David,
 I
 don't know
 how
 it


is
 in
 developing
 AI
 where
 there
 probably


wasn't
 a
 rule
 book
 before
 anyway,
 but
 in


healthcare,
 you
 know,
 there
 have
 been


doctors
 since
 the
 dawn
 of
 of,
 you
 know,


since
 humans
 left
 Africa
 50,000
 years


ago,
 there
 were
 doctors
 in
 the


encampment.
 And
 so
 there
 is
 a
 way
 of


doing
 things.
 And
 in
 government,
 that


exists
 as
 well,
 but
 it's
 not
 always
 the


right
 way
 to
 do
 things.
 So,
 for
 example,


we
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 make
 laws.
 Every


part
 of
 the
 administration
 pretty
 much


can.
 We
 get
 Congress
 to
 do
 stuff.
 It


doesn't
 always
 turn
 out
 the
 way
 you
 want


it
 to
 turn
 out,
 and
 it
 takes
 a
 lot
 of


time.
 and
 the
 negotiated
 final
 result
 uh


sometimes
 falls
 short.
 You
 have


rulemaking,
 second
 big
 area,
 which
 is,


you
 know,
 administrative
 entities
 like


ours
 can
 write
 the
 rules
 that
 everyone


has
 to
 follow.
 We're
 going to
 pay
 you


this
 much.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 let
 these


people
 do
 that
 anymore.
 Uh
 it
 does
 take


some
 time.
 Uh
 and
 it's
 prone
 to
 lawfare.


By
 that,
 I
 mean
 the
 people
 you're


regulating,
 if
 they
 don't
 like
 what


you're
 saying,
 they
 can
 sue
 you
 and
 they


can
 stop
 you.
 And
 in
 this


administration,
 if
 the
 other
 party


doesn't
 like
 what
 you're
 doing,
 even
 if


it's
 the
 best
 thing,
 we
 had
 a
 a
 rule


that
 would
 reduce
 fraud,
 but
 the
 blue


cities
 didn't
 like
 it
 because
 it
 was


coming
 from
 someone
 they
 didn't
 like,


the
 president.
 So,
 they
 enjoined
 it,
 and


that's
 now
 caught
 up
 in
 court.
 Now,


we'll
 win,
 but
 it
 could
 take
 years.
 So,


that's
 the
 second
 big
 way,
 right?
 So,


you
 make
 laws,
 you
 pass
 rules.
 The
 third


way,
 which
 historically
 government
 has


not
 used,
 I
 don't
 think
 as
 effectively


as
 possible.
 And
 this
 president,
 because


he's
 a
 great
 negotiator,
 is
 able
 to
 to


push
 us
 in
 ways
 that
 historically
 not


been
 done,
 is
 to
 just
 use
 the
 power
 to


convene.
 The
 US
 government
 can
 bring


people
 together
 who
 would
 not
 normally


talk.
 They
 can
 give
 safe
 harbor
 to


industry
 to
 come
 together
 and
 discuss


problems
 that
 historically
 they
 would


shy
 away.


>> What's
 the
 great
 example
 of
 that?
 I'm


I'm
 wondering
 if
 it's
 the
 drug
 companies


who
 they
 have
 something
 to
 lose
 because


Trump's
 been
 President
 Trump
 has
 been


very
 clear.
 Hey,
 I
 want
 these
 prices


lowered.
 Why
 are
 we
 the
 sucker
 at
 the


poker
 table?
 We're
 paying
 10
 times
 what


Canada's
 paying.
 Is
 that
 the
 best


example
 in
 your
 experience
 so
 far?


>> It's
 a
 great
 example.
 Most
 favored


nation
 drug
 pricing.
 It
 specifically


addresses
 the
 problem
 you
 outlined,


which
 is
 we
 just
 pay
 a
 bunch
 more
 for


the
 exact
 same
 product
 made
 the
 same


factory
 often
 in
 America
 than
 our


counterparts
 do
 here
 in
 Europe.
 So
 the


president
 says
 we
 need
 to
 change
 that.


So
 he
 says
 go
 talk
 to
 the
 drug
 companies


uh
 create
 some
 opportunities
 for
 risk


for
 them
 you
 know
 make
 some
 rules
 create


some
 pro
 projects
 that
 if
 we
 were
 to
 act


on
 them
 would
 really
 hurt
 them


>> a
 little
 pressure


>> little
 pressure
 you
 know
 build
 the


crowbars
 and
 the
 baseball
 bats


>> okay


>> cut
 some
 trees
 down
 hone
 the
 wood
 but


don't
 use
 them


>> and
 he's
 very
 specifically
 said
 do
 not


hurt
 the
 innovative
 nature
 of


pharmaceuticals
 they
 are
 important
 to


our
 nation
 they
 save
 lives
 uh
 We
 want
 to


have
 the
 most
 innovative
 industries
 in


the
 world
 because
 that's
 where
 the


opportunities
 are
 to
 differentiate


ourselves.
 It's
 also
 part
 of
 our


national
 destiny.
 Be
 the
 best.
 So
 don't


hurt
 the
 industry,
 but
 take
 some
 of
 the


fat
 out
 of
 it.
 Pull
 it
 back
 and
 give
 it


to
 the
 American
 people.
 Plus,
 it's
 the


fair
 way
 of
 doing
 things.
 And


metaphorically,
 when
 you
 think
 about


NATO
 and
 the
 president
 saying
 to
 NATO


countries,
 we're
 all
 in
 it
 together
 to


protect
 ourselves
 against
 external


threats.
 You
 guys
 got
 to
 put
 up
 more


money.
 We'll
 put
 up
 more
 uh
 but


proportionally
 more.
 It's
 got
 to
 be


fair.
 And
 they
 all
 did
 that
 pretty
 much


with
 one
 or
 two
 exceptions.
 He
 did
 the


same
 thing
 with
 pharmaceuticals.
 He
 said


there's
 an
 external
 threat
 which
 is


Russia
 or
 you
 know
 foreign
 governments.


There's
 internal
 threats
 like
 cancer.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 we
 want
 everyone
 to
 chip
 in.
 We
 pay


in
 United
 States
 8%
 of
 our
 GDP
 towards


pharmaceutical
 products.


>> 8%
 1%
 of
 our
 GDP
 goes
 to
 drugs.
 That's


not
 the
 health
 care
 system
 which
 I
 think


is
 17%.


>> Right.


>> 1%
 of
 it
 a
 full
 6%
 of
 our
 healthcare


goes
 just
 directly
 to
 the
 drug


companies.
 So
 we
 want


>> What's
 with
 your
 math?


>> It's
 quite
 quite
 impressive.


>> Yeah.
 Thank
 you.


>> So
 point
 I
 only
 bring
 this
 up
 because


the
 percentages
 make
 a
 difference
 here.


08%


>> comes
 from
 us
 playing
 blackjack.


>> Calculator
 to
 this.
 I
 know
 you
 comes


from
 us
 playing
 blackjack
 and
 poker


together.
 You
 I've
 lost
 a
 lot
 two
 hours


over
 here.


>> I
 Well,
 I've
 been
 I've
 lost
 a
 lot
 of


money
 to
 this
 guy
 and
 I
 don't
 play
 him


in
 chess
 anymore.


>> Bend
 but
 don't
 break.
 You
 want
 them
 to


bend
 a
 little
 bit.
 Be
 reasonable
 but
 you


don't
 want
 to
 break
 the
 industry
 as
 a


doctor.


>> What's
 the
 upshot
 of
 this?
 Because
 you


hear
 this
 term
 affordability
 a
 lot.
 So


the
 average
 American's
 going
 to
 pay
 less


for
 their
 drug
 prices.


>> We're
 going
 to
 pay
 less.
 The
 Europeans,


we
 are
 telling
 the
 all
 the
 countries,


we're
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 these


discussions.
 We've
 just
 gotten
 the


British
 to
 say
 yes
 and
 other
 countries


are
 talking
 to
 us
 about
 the
 fact
 that


they
 pay.3%.
 So
 less
 than
 half
 of
 what


we
 paid
 percentwise
 is
 being
 spent
 by


them.
 And
 and
 they
 get
 away
 with
 it


because
 their
 people
 don't
 realize
 that


if
 you
 get
 cancer,
 more
 advanced
 cancers


in
 Europe,
 your
 survival
 rate's
 way


below
 the
 US.
 And
 if
 you
 don't
 if
 you


don't
 get
 access
 to
 the
 drugs,
 which


they
 don't
 for
 several
 years
 on
 average


that
 we
 get
 in
 the
 US,
 yes,
 you
 can
 get


it
 for
 cheaper,
 but
 your
 people
 are


paying
 a
 price.
 And
 this
 is
 going
 to
 say


the
 most
 important
 message
 I'm
 going
 to


deliver
 today.
 The
 most
 important


message
 is
 don't
 think
 about
 healthcare


like
 an
 expense.
 Think
 of
 it
 as
 an


investment
 because
 if
 I
 can
 get
 the


average
 American
 to
 work
 one
 year
 longer


because
 I
 got
 them
 a
 medication
 at
 a


better
 price,
 they
 didn't
 turn
 away
 at


the
 drugstore
 or
 because
 we
 able
 to
 do


something
 else
 correct


>> whatever
 the
 envir
 the
 movement.
 We'll


talk
 about
 all
 this,
 but
 if
 you
 can
 get


the
 average
 American
 to
 work
 one
 year


longer,
 that
 is
 worth
 $3
 trillion
 to
 the


US
 economy.
 It's
 massive.


>> So,
 we
 we
 need
 to
 get
 people
 feeling


their
 best,
 feeling
 that
 they
 have


agency
 over
 their
 future
 with
 confidence


that
 they're
 going
 to
 make
 a
 difference


in
 the
 world
 so
 they
 want
 to
 keep
 trying


to
 do
 it
 at
 the
 workplace.
 And
 that


extra
 one
 year,
 which
 gets
 them
 closer


to
 Medicare,
 by
 the
 way,
 also
 helps
 deal


with
 other
 financial
 crises
 that
 we're


facing
 as
 a
 nation.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 way


to
 think
 about
 it
 the
 right
 way.
 Get
 the


actual
 cost
 of
 care
 down.
 Don't
 just
 pay


more
 money
 into
 the
 system.
 Get
 the


actual
 cost
 of
 care
 down
 so
 the
 money


we're
 spending
 gets
 us
 more
 value.


>> We're
 spending
 twice
 as
 much
 as
 these


other
 countries
 who
 have
 universal


healthcare.
 Now,
 you
 did
 point
 out
 that


they
 get
 things
 later.
 So,
 we
 have
 a


better
 system,
 but
 we
 pay
 through
 the


nose
 for
 it.
 That
 that
 would
 be
 an


accurate
 way
 of
 describing
 the
 current


state
 of
 affairs.


>> Precisely
 stated.
 Yes.


>> Okay.
 So,
 how
 do
 we
 get
 every
 American


healthcare?
 because
 I
 believe
 a
 lot
 of


the
 tension
 we
 have
 comes
 from
 a
 fear


from
 people
 maybe
 who
 are
 not
 as
 well


off
 as
 as
 the
 people
 on
 the
 pod
 right


now
 and
 they
 live
 with
 that
 fear.
 We


don't
 live
 with
 that
 fear.
 We
 know
 if
 we


need
 to
 get
 healthcare,
 we're
 going
 to


figure
 it
 out.
 We'll
 be
 able
 to
 pay
 for


it
 out
 of
 pocket
 or
 insurance
 will
 pay


for
 it.
 But
 there
 are
 people
 who
 go


bankrupt
 because
 of
 this.
 You
 believe
 in


universal
 healthcare.
 I
 would
 assume
 as


a
 doctor.


>> I
 want
 everyone
 to
 have
 access
 to
 health


care.
 But
 how
 we
 pay
 for
 it
 is
 the


defining
 issue
 here.
 How
 do
 you
 keep
 the


system
 incentivized
 to
 take
 care
 of
 you?


If
 I
 tell
 everybody
 in
 America
 that
 you


have
 healthare
 and
 then
 I
 tell
 the


doctors,
 give
 them
 healthare,
 but
 they


don't
 deal
 with
 the
 financial
 costs
 of


then
 you
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 start
 to


restrict
 the
 access
 to
 care.
 So
 you
 can


get
 the
 health
 care
 like
 you
 do
 in


socialized
 medicine
 countries.
 You
 just


have
 to
 wait
 6
 months
 or
 a
 year
 or


longer
 or
 you
 don't
 get
 the
 care
 at
 all.


And
 when
 you
 start
 having
 that


discussion
 with
 Americans,
 they
 say,


"Wait,
 wait,
 hold
 on a
 second.
 Yes,
 of


course
 I
 want
 uh
 to
 get
 the
 healthcare


for
 an
 affordable
 price."
 But
 the


question
 the
 fundamental
 question
 is
 how


long
 till
 I
 actually
 get
 the
 care
 there


>> being
 denied
 is
 something
 they
 live


with.
 So
 they
 complain
 about
 their


universal
 healthcare.
 We
 complain
 about


not
 having
 universal
 healthcare.
 What


are
 the
 two
 or


>> the
 thing
 I
 would
 look
 at
 is
 the
 flow
 of


patients
 who
 seek
 treatment


internationally.
 So
 I
 hear
 lots
 of


stories
 about
 Canadians
 coming
 to
 the
 US


to
 get
 treatment
 because
 they
 don't
 want


to
 wait
 two
 years
 for
 some
 proced
 not


just
 the
 latest
 to
 get
 some
 procedure


because
 they
 could
 be
 dead
 in
 2
 years.


So
 they
 come
 here.
 I
 don't
 hear
 any


Americans
 talking
 about
 going
 to
 Canada


to
 get
 treatment.


>> We
 actually
 do
 have
 uh
 a
 number
 of


examples
 of
 that
 in
 surgeries
 and


treatments
 that
 you
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 out


of
 pocket.
 Cosmetic,
 dental,
 people
 are


going
 and
 this
 has
 become
 tourism
 and


there
 are
 people
 who
 do
 change


locations.
 Yes.
 for
 electron
 procedures.


You
 mentioned
 cosmetic
 surgery.
 That's


definitely
 a
 trend.


>> Uh
 and
 also
 there's
 some
 procedures
 that


we
 don't
 do
 in
 America.


>> Stem
 cells,


>> but
 your
 stem
 cells
 there
 that
 they're


still
 going
 through
 the
 regulatory


process.
 But
 the
 the
 the
 bigger
 issue
 is


really
 is
 the
 one
 David's
 raising,
 which


is
 most
 Americans
 complain
 that
 the


health
 care
 system
 is
 broken.
 Almost


none
 would
 leave
 the
 country
 to
 get
 top


tier
 health
 care
 for
 a
 life-threatening


problem.
 And
 so
 we
 have
 this
 sort
 of


bizarre
 opportunity.
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 an


opportunity.
 How
 do
 we
 make
 the
 top
 tier


health
 care
 available
 to
 to
 folks
 who


need
 it
 but
 do
 it
 at
 a
 price
 that
 is


sustainable?
 And
 that's
 where
 I
 think


your
 specialty
 area
 comes
 into
 play.


Before
 this
 administration,
 I
 think


because
 we
 didn't
 have
 the
 right


technologies
 to
 promise
 convincingly


that
 we
 could
 do
 this,
 there
 was
 a


hesitancy
 to
 make
 big
 shifts.
 We're


taking
 big
 swings
 because
 we
 think
 AI
 is


ready.
 We
 think
 the
 tech
 transformation


that's
 that's
 that
 could
 happen
 in


healthcare
 is
 worth
 subsidizing.
 And
 by


that
 I
 mean
 making
 it
 possible
 for
 top


tier
 entrepreneurs
 who
 are
 building
 apps


that
 can
 help
 you
 deal
 with
 the
 medical


crisis
 that
 you're
 dealing
 with
 their


diabetes.
 We
 can
 put
 money
 into
 the


system
 to
 make
 that
 worth
 you
 doing.
 So


you
 can
 get
 investors
 to
 support
 you.


You
 can
 get
 a
 fair
 valuation.


>> The
 technology
 to
 lower
 the
 price.


Obviously
 that's
 a
 huge
 win.
 Let
 me
 ask


you
 the
 the
 difficult
 question
 as
 a


doctor.
 There
 have
 been
 studies
 that


came
 out
 recently
 that
 not
 only
 do
 LLMs


currently
 give
 better
 advice
 than
 the


average
 general
 practitioner,
 they
 have


better
 bedside
 manner
 and
 the
 customers


or
 the
 patients
 enjoy
 the
 LLM
 more
 than


they
 enjoyed
 a
 GP.


>> Where
 did
 you
 see
 that?
 I
 haven't
 seen


that.


>> This
 is
 a
 study
 that
 came
 out
 of
 either


Harvard
 or
 MIT.
 I
 I'll
 put
 it
 in
 the


show
 notes,
 but
 this
 is
 a
 pretty


groundbreaking.
 What
 are
 your
 thoughts


if
 you
 were
 going
 to
 a
 new
 society?
 Is


this
 idea
 that
 you
 have
 to
 go
 to
 the
 GP,


they
 ask
 you
 a
 bunch
 of
 questions,
 then


they
 go
 on
 their
 medical
 text,
 figure


out
 what
 their
 advice
 is,
 is
 that
 the


best
 modality
 or
 would
 it
 be
 better
 for


the
 common
 cold
 for
 an
 ankle
 sprain
 to


do
 what
 most
 Americans
 without
 insurance


are
 doing
 or
 people
 who
 are


self-directed?
 They
 go
 on
 a
 large


language
 model.
 It
 says
 here's
 how
 you


deal
 with
 these
 issues
 and
 they
 do
 it


themselves
 and
 they
 can
 take
 care
 of
 a


couple
 things.
 Wouldn't
 it
 be
 better
 to


just
 have
 them
 do
 this
 stuff
 and
 then


decide
 if
 they
 should
 go
 see
 their
 GP?


>> I
 think
 there's
 a
 hybrid
 of
 that
 that


derisks
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 early
 on.
 There


are
 definitely
 problems
 with


hallucination
 and
 the
 like
 that
 that


Americans
 we
 very
 intolerant
 to.
 We


actually
 understand
 if
 a
 human
 being
 who


has
 an
 MD
 degree
 makes
 a
 mistake.
 We


think
 AI
 is
 perfect


>> and
 are
 completely
 intolerant
 of
 even
 a


minor
 uh
 transgression.
 What
 you
 said


earlier
 is
 true
 and
 these
 studies
 have


been
 done
 several
 times
 now.
 the
 the
 the


large
 language
 models
 do
 better
 on
 board


exams.
 So,
 ab
 general
 knowledge,
 they're


better
 than
 a
 doctor.
 They're
 more


patient
 than
 a
 doctor.
 If
 you
 talk
 to
 an


AI
 uh
 informed
 avatar,
 they'll
 answer


the
 same
 10
 questions
 on
 diabetes
 all


day
 long
 and
 not
 get
 bored.
 Talk
 to
 a


general
 practitioner
 after
 they've


talked
 to
 10
 patients
 with
 diabetes


who've
 asked
 the
 same
 10
 questions,
 you


get
 a
 little
 tur
 in
 your
 responses.


That's
 just
 human
 nature.
 I
 don't
 want


to
 answer
 the
 same
 question
 every
 time,


but
 that's
 what
 patients
 need
 you
 to
 do.


So
 I
 think
 we
 have
 the
 opportunity
 and


we
 looked
 at
 some
 of
 these
 models.
 Uh
 in


fact
 John
 Door
 brought
 a
 bunch
 of
 very


thoughtful
 entrepreneurs
 into
 the


building
 to
 talk
 about
 the
 possibility


of
 us
 taking
 the
 average
 general


practitioner
 and
 making
 them
 five
 times


maybe
 even
 10
 times
 more
 efficient.
 Now


here's
 the
 big
 deal.
 There
 are
 not


enough
 GPS
 in
 America.
 We
 probably
 need


two
 to
 three
 times
 more
 just
 to
 keep
 up


with
 Europe
 just
 per
 capita.
 We're
 way


below
 because
 my
 son
 just
 finished


medical
 school.
 There
 aren't
 many
 kids


in
 medical
 school
 at
 Colombia
 where
 he


went
 who
 are
 going
 to
 become
 GPS.
 They


all
 want
 to
 be
 opthalmologists
 and,
 you


know,
 orthopedic
 surgeons
 because
 they


pay
 a
 lot
 more


>> and
 they
 got
 big
 loans
 for
 their
 uh


>> Yeah.
 And
 they're
 in
 debt.
 They're
 in


debt.


>> Yeah.
 And
 this
 is
 even
 Colombia
 is
 free.


If
 you
 don't,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 money,


you
 don't
 have
 to
 pay
 tuition
 at


Colombia.
 They
 did
 that
 so
 that
 kids


would
 go
 into
 general
 practice
 and


hasn't
 had
 the
 desired
 impact
 yet.
 But


the
 broader
 question
 is
 how
 do
 we
 allow


AI
 to
 play
 a
 role
 as
 this
 transition


period
 happens
 so
 people
 feel
 confident


and
 one
 way
 of
 doing
 it
 is
 to
 allow
 it


to
 do
 most
 of
 the
 work
 and
 then


especially
 with
 agentic
 AI
 take
 the


paperwork
 out
 of
 it
 the
 busy
 work
 out
 of


it
 and
 feed
 the
 doctor
 the
 key


information.
 What's
 the
 most
 important


thing
 I
 do
 as
 a
 doctor?
 I
 look
 at
 you
 in


the
 eyes
 and
 I
 read
 you
 and
 I
 try
 to


connect
 with
 you.
 50%
 of
 our
 cortex
 of


our
 co
 high
 cognitive
 function
 50%
 of
 it


is
 to
 read
 your
 face.
 We're
 hardwired
 to


be
 social
 animals.
 To
 understand
 the


subtle
 little
 David's
 bored,
 you're
 not.


I
 got
 to
 change
 the
 pacing.
 I
 got
 to
 get


back
 to
 him.
 He's
 doing
 card


calculations
 in
 his
 head.


>> He
 was,
 in
 fairness
 to
 David,
 he
 was
 out


till
 1:00
 a.m.
 They
 dragged
 him
 to
 four


meetings.
 I
 was
 in
 bed
 at
 night.
 I
 have


good
 sleep.
 I
 got
 my
 Whoop.
 I
 got
 my


sleep
 score.
 I
 am
 a
 pillow
 princess
 like


you,
 Dr.
 Oz.
 I
 hear
 that
 you're
 extreme


about
 your
 sleep.


>> Well,
 I'm
 a
 good
 sleep.
 My
 wife
 is
 a


world-class
 sleeper.
 She
 brings
 her
 own


pillows.


>> Your
 wife
 is
 delightful,
 by
 the
 way.
 I
 I


did
 an
 hour
 interview
 with
 Lisa
 before


you
 even
 got
 on
 stage
 here.
 I
 was
 like,


"Wow,
 she's
 impressive."


>> To
 build
 on
 this
 point,
 I
 mean,
 I
 think


it's
 interesting.
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


get
 smarter
 doctors
 and
 smarter


patients,
 and
 they're
 each
 going
 to
 use


their
 own
 version
 of
 AI.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 what
 patients
 are
 going
 to


use
 is
 a
 is
 a
 consumer
 product,
 JBT,


Grock,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 forth.
 What's


interesting,
 I
 think,
 is
 when
 they
 can


dump
 in
 their
 blood
 panels
 cuz
 cuz
 AI
 is


so
 good
 at
 reading
 PDFs,
 you
 know,
 just


unstructured
 data.
 So,
 you
 dump
 all
 your


stuff
 in
 it.
 You
 ask
 for
 a
 diagnosis,


you
 get
 smarter.
 You
 can
 research
 your


own
 condition.
 You're
 not
 wasting


frankly
 the
 doctor's
 time
 by
 asking


basic
 consumer.
 You're
 a
 better


customer.


>> So
 you
 go
 more
 educated
 and
 then
 the


doctors
 they
 can
 use
 chat
 GBT
 or
 what


have
 you,
 but
 actually
 they're
 using


specialized
 much
 more
 specialized
 tools


that
 the
 ones
 I've
 seen.
 They
 will
 give


you
 a
 citation
 directly
 to
 a
 medical


journal
 that
 you
 can
 bring.
 That's
 very


important
 to
 doctors.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it's


not
 hallucinating.
 Just
 getting
 the


answer
 from
 a,
 you
 know,
 from
 a
 was
 on


Joe
 Rogan
 podcast,
 you
 need
 to
 know
 what


the
 source
 is,


>> which
 is
 fine.
 If
 you
 if
 you
 get


information
 from
 Joe
 and
 backwards
 to


respected
 medical
 journal,


>> let
 me
 ask
 you
 about
 this
 trend.


>> This
 is
 self-directed
 healthcare.


There's
 function
 health
 doing
 blood


labs,
 superpower,
 whoop
 just
 started


offering
 them.
 Aura,
 Apple
 Watch,
 HLEP,


I'm
 an
 investor
 in
 that
 one.
 Full


disclosure,
 it's
 doing
 great.
 These


things
 are
 now
 putting
 all
 that
 data


together
 and
 starting
 to
 tell
 you
 your


life,
 your
 health
 span,
 your,
 you
 know,


your
 actual
 age
 versus
 your
 health
 age.


I
 don't
 sure
 what
 that
 metric
 is,
 but


people
 are
 now
 measuring
 things
 and


getting
 some
 knowledge
 of
 this
 and
 then


going
 to
 a
 GP.
 The
 problem
 I'm
 having


is,
 and
 I'm
 not
 price
 sensitive.
 I
 could


get
 any
 concierge
 doctor
 I
 want.
 There's


very
 few
 doctors
 who
 want
 to
 work
 like


this
 at
 the
 moment.
 That's
 something's


got
 to
 change.
 But
 what
 do
 you
 think
 of


this
 new
 group
 of
 people
 who
 are
 doing


self-directed
 healthcare
 doing
 two
 blood


labs
 a
 year
 putting
 it
 into
 a
 database?


Uh
 POVA
 with
 the
 3D
 scans,
 Nico,
 Daniel


X,
 new
 company
 doing
 a
 $300
 full
 body


scan.
 All
 of
 this
 is
 this
 going
 to
 be


the
 paradigm
 shift?


>> 8020
 rule.
 If
 20%
 of
 Americans
 do
 what


you're
 saying,
 and
 they
 will,
 yeah,


>> it'll
 make
 all
 of
 medicine
 function


better.
 I'm
 actually
 concerned
 about
 the


other
 end
 of
 the
 spectrum.
 Tell
 me


>> the
 people
 who
 don't
 go
 to
 their


doctors,
 Medicaid
 patients,
 Medicaid


patients
 are
 twice
 as
 likely.
 Medicaid


is
 the
 folks
 who
 are
 vulnerable,
 who


are,
 you
 know,
 have
 made
 less
 money,
 uh,


they're
 getting
 government
 health


insurance,
 right?


>> Medicare,


>> that
 is
 our
 universal
 healthare,


>> right?
 That's
 that's
 where
 we
 need
 help.


The
 chance
 of
 a
 Medicaid
 patient
 who


doesn't
 pay
 for
 their
 health
 care


because
 they
 don't
 have
 the
 means
 to
 do


it.
 The
 chance
 of
 them
 canceling
 their


doctor's
 appointment
 is
 twice
 that
 of
 a


Medicare
 patient.
 And
 so,
 it's
 hard
 to


take
 care
 of
 them.
 Now,
 they
 they
 have


two
 jobs.
 They'll
 get
 fired
 if
 they


leave
 the
 job
 early.
 They
 don't
 have
 the


the
 the
 flexibility
 of
 moving
 their


calendar
 around.
 They
 don't
 have


transportation.
 There's
 lots
 of
 reasons


they
 don't
 show.
 But
 if
 I
 can't
 get


healthcare
 to
 them,
 that's
 a
 major


crisis
 for
 us.
 And
 so
 the
 real


opportunity
 for
 AI
 is
 democratizing


healthcare.
 Yes.
 See,
 you
 guys
 are


already
 smart.
 You
 just
 listed
 off
 top


of
 your
 head
 a
 dozen
 companies
 all
 doing


great
 work.
 Most
 people
 have
 no
 idea


these
 companies
 exist
 or
 what
 they
 do


exist,
 right?
 And
 so
 if
 I
 can
 put
 into


to
 AI
 my
 labs
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 much


about
 healthare
 I
 can
 get
 information


sent
 to
 me
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I
 can
 process


it
 and
 at
 the
 time
 I'm
 ready
 to
 hear
 it.


Now
 I'll
 give
 you
 one
 more
 data
 point


that
 might
 be
 useful.
 All
 Medicare


patients,
 all
 seniors
 over
 65,
 all
 of


them
 are
 given
 a
 free
 wellness
 exam


every
 year.
 What
 percentage
 of
 people


take
 their
 free
 medical
 exam
 with?


>> Less
 than
 5%.


>> No,
 it's
 not
 that
 bad.
 It's
 less
 than


50%.


>> Less
 than
 50%.


>> Okay.
 But
 most
 people
 don't
 do
 it.
 It's


there.
 And
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 we
 think


that's
 happening
 is
 you
 don't
 prioritize


it.
 And
 here's
 the
 more
 important
 data


point.
 People
 who
 actually
 see
 their


doctor
 think
 they're
 sicker,
 but
 they're


actually
 much
 healthier
 than
 people
 who


don't
 see
 their
 doctor
 because
 ignorance


is
 bliss.
 People
 don't
 go
 to
 their
 doc


or
 seek
 any
 kind
 of
 health
 advice
 think


that
 they're
 doing
 great.
 And
 actually,


objectively,
 they're
 doing
 much
 worse.


So,
 we
 have
 an
 opportunity
 to


democratize
 this
 by
 saying,
 "Okay,
 I'm


going
 to
 meet
 you
 where
 you
 are.
 You


don't
 care
 about
 going
 to
 see
 a
 doctor


even
 though
 it's
 free.
 It's
 yours
 in


this
 new
 health
 tech
 ecosystem
 we're


building
 out.
 I'm
 with
 Amy
 Gleason
 who


also
 ran
 Doge,
 you
 know,
 helping
 to
 to


to
 roll
 this
 all
 out.
 We're
 making
 it


easier
 for
 every
 tech
 company
 to


participate.
 600
 companies
 have
 signed
 a


pledge
 agreeing
 to
 interoperability
 and


data
 transparency
 and
 to
 build
 these


tools
 for
 the
 American
 people
 to
 be
 able


to
 use
 them.
 Now,
 once
 I
 a
 deputize
 you


to
 be
 better
 equipped
 to
 take
 care
 of


yourself,
 you
 change
 the
 system.
 Because


when
 you
 ask
 a
 doctor
 a
 question,
 the


first
 time
 you're
 the
 only
 patient,
 they


don't
 pay
 attention.
 The
 second
 patient


who
 asks
 the
 same
 question,
 we
 change.


As
 a
 physician,
 I'm
 telling
 you,
 it


helps
 us
 to
 have
 patients
 pushing
 us
 to


pay
 attention
 to,
 for example,
 ambient


collection
 of
 information
 in
 the


doctor's
 office.
 So,
 I
 get
 a
 medical


report
 on
 what
 you
 told
 me.
 Why?
 Because


50%
 of
 what
 a
 doctor
 tells
 the
 patient


is
 forgotten
 before
 the
 patient
 leaves


the
 office.
 So,
 when
 your
 kid
 asks
 you,


hey,
 what
 happened
 with
 the
 doctor?
 You


don't
 remember.
 You're
 nervous.
 You're


anxious.
 The
 doctor
 spoke
 quickly.
 Use


big
 words.
 Break
 all
 that
 down.
 And
 all


of a
 sudden,
 information
 gets
 flowing


easily.
 Now
 you've
 got
 a
 lot
 more


stakeholders.
 And
 who's
 the
 ultimate


stakeholder?
 The
 patient.
 So
 the
 medical


records
 who
 historically
 have
 been


hijacked
 by
 medical
 record
 companies


>> and
 hidden


>> and
 hidden


>> like
 how
 do
 you
 ever
 get
 them?


>> Yeah.
 And
 all
 those
 companies
 now
 are


saying,
 "All
 right,
 we
 get
 the
 joke."


And
 this
 is
 again
 back
 to
 the
 president.


He's
 not
 fooling
 around
 in
 this
 stuff.


When
 he
 tells
 you
 he
 wants
 you
 to
 share


data,
 you
 know
 he's
 going
 to
 come
 after


your
 ass
 if
 you
 don't
 deal
 with
 this


problem.
 And
 so
 they've
 all
 come
 and
 all


right,
 you
 know,
 we're
 not
 on
 the
 joke


now.
 The
 pharma
 companies
 when
 we're


negotiating
 most
 favored
 nation.
 You


know
 what
 they
 said
 when
 we
 challenged


them
 and
 said,
 "You're
 you're
 charging


several
 times
 more
 for
 the
 same


products."
 They
 said,
 "All
 right,
 well,


we
 knew
 one
 day
 you'd
 come
 knocking."
 We


knew
 they
 do.
 So,
 and
 we
 actually
 think


the
 president
 would
 do
 something
 to
 us,


so
 we're
 going
 to
 negotiate.
 And
 you


don't
 want
 to
 throw
 away
 that
 power.


>> You
 know,
 don't
 beg
 for
 forgiveness.


Push
 for
 action.
 Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 go
 make
 things
 happen.
 And
 if


they
 don't
 work
 out,
 fine.
 You
 you


you'll
 get
 more
 more
 bites
 at
 the
 apple.


>> Just
 on
 that
 point
 about
 the
 pledge


because
 I
 got
 to
 attend
 that
 event
 at


the
 White
 House.


>> You
 organized
 it.


>> Well,
 don't
 be
 modest.
 I
 mean,
 that's


going to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 too
 much


credit,
 but
 it
 was
 honestly
 it
 was
 you


and
 Amy
 Gleason
 and
 Secretary
 Kennedy


and
 you
 guys
 just
 happened
 to
 invite
 me


for
 some
 reason,
 but
 it
 was
 it
 was


really
 interesting
 cuz
 so
 this
 is
 my


kind
 of
 layman's
 understanding
 of
 it,


which
 is
 the
 law
 gives
 us
 the
 right
 to


our
 own
 medical
 records,
 but
 in


practice,
 we
 don't
 get
 them.


>> HIPPA
 regulated.


>> Well,
 it's
 it's
 because
 the
 the


companies
 that
 store
 the
 health
 records


Yeah.
 do
 it
 in
 proprietary
 formats
 and


we
 don't
 really
 know
 how
 to
 get
 that


data
 and
 what
 would
 we
 do
 with
 it
 even


if
 we
 did.
 So
 the
 key
 is
 to
 get
 those


health
 records
 shared
 to
 all
 the
 other


medical
 companies
 in
 the
 space
 that
 we


might
 want
 to
 use.
 Hence
 the
 power
 of


the
 pledge
 get
 these
 600
 companies


agreeing.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 AI
 is
 kind
 of


the
 magic
 glue
 here
 because
 AI
 is
 so


good
 at
 reading
 data
 from
 different


formats
 and
 translating
 it.
 So
 you
 don't


need
 like
 a
 perfect
 API
 anymore.
 You


just
 get
 the
 unstructured
 data,
 dump
 it


in,
 and
 now
 it
 just
 works.


>> Which
 is
 what
 we're
 starting
 to
 see.
 I'm


taking
 my
 eight
 sleep
 data,
 my
 Whoop


data,
 my
 blood
 panels,
 and
 I'm
 putting


it
 into
 all
 four
 of
 the
 major
 ones,


asking
 it.
 I
 take
 pictures
 of
 every
 one


of
 my
 supplements
 or
 drinks.
 What
 impact


will
 this
 have?
 Which
 impact
 will
 this


have
 on
 sleeping?


>> I
 think
 that's
 like
 this
 gigantic
 win.


>> Yeah.
 you
 being
 able
 to
 realize
 the


promise
 that
 the
 law
 gives
 you
 to


actually
 own
 your
 own
 medical
 data,
 but


to
 get
 it
 in
 a
 usable
 format
 that
 now


you
 can
 use
 again
 a
 chat
 interface
 to


understand
 it.


>> It's
 technological
 obscurification.


Let's
 call
 it
 what
 it
 is.
 They're
 trying


to
 use
 these
 proprietary
 formats
 always


to
 get
 a
 technological
 advantage
 and
 to


have
 a
 moat
 around
 their
 business.


>> AI
 just
 decodes
 that
 and
 makes
 it
 usable


and
 now
 you
 can
 you
 can
 interact
 with


it.
 Can
 can
 I
 bring
 up
 one
 other


example?
 So,
 Dr.
 You
 mentioned


democratization.
 And
 you
 and
 I
 have
 had


a
 conversation
 about
 certain
 states
 are


actually
 trying
 to
 ban
 the
 use
 of
 AI
 to


be
 used
 in
 therapy.
 And
 I
 think
 the


point
 you
 made
 to
 me
 is
 you
 know what


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 places
 all
 over
 the


country
 like
 rural
 areas
 where
 there


aren't
 psychiatrists
 or
 there
 isn't


psychiatric
 care.
 So
 at least
 AI


provides
 a
 baseline
 level
 of
 service.
 It


version
 one
 may
 not
 have
 been
 perfect.


There
 may
 have
 been
 some
 hallucination


but
 it
 is
 getting
 better
 and
 better


every
 year.
 If
 you
 ban
 it,
 then
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 just
 going
 to
 have
 nothing,


right?
 I
 mean,


>> beautifully
 stated.
 Let's
 just
 go
 over


let's
 unwrap
 that
 a
 little
 bit,
 but
 I'd


be
 just
 at
 a
 high
 level
 say
 AI
 is
 coming


to
 a
 neighborhood
 near
 you.
 You're
 not


stopping
 it.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 it's
 going
 to
 be there
 and
 patients


are
 going
 to
 use
 it.
 And
 so,
 you
 have
 to


engage
 it
 running
 from
 it.
 You
 know,
 uh,


you
 know,
 we
 we
 we
 cannot
 stick
 our
 head


in
 the
 sand
 on
 this
 one.
 There's
 other


things
 you
 can
 sort
 of
 delay,
 but
 I
 I've


encouraged
 every
 governor
 go
 full
 boore


at
 this,
 but
 do
 it
 in
 the
 right
 way.


Allow
 professionals
 to
 function
 at
 the


height
 of
 their
 lensure.
 Why
 don't
 we


use
 pharmacists
 better?
 There's
 probably


70,000
 pharmacists,
 right?
 And
 think


about
 this
 way.
 Almost
 all
 Americans,


95%
 live
 within
 five
 miles
 of
 a


pharmacy.
 There's
 they
 don't
 live
 near


five,
 you
 know,
 near
 a
 hospital
 usually.


So,
 we
 don't
 have
 access
 to
 care
 in
 many


ways.
 If
 we
 just
 took
 AI
 and
 allowed


pharmacists
 and
 doctors,
 GPS
 to
 function


at
 a
 higher
 level,
 it
 itself
 would
 be


worth
 the
 opportunity.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 even


saying
 advocate
 at
 all
 to
 a
 to
 a
 to
 an


AI
 agent
 that
 doesn't
 really
 understand


you.
 we
 can't
 control.
 Maybe,
 you
 know,


some
 other
 country
 gets
 involved
 in
 it.


At
 its
 very
 practical
 level,
 we
 do
 not


have
 enough
 practitioners.
 There
 just


aren't
 enough
 people
 to
 take
 care
 of


rural
 America.
 60
 million
 Americans


living
 in
 rural
 America
 don't
 have


access
 to
 mental
 health
 services.
 Our


vets
 commit
 suicide
 at
 a
 crazy
 high


rate,
 more
 than
 we
 lose
 in
 war
 because


they
 don't
 have
 access
 to
 mental
 health


services.
 Many
 of
 them
 do
 live
 in
 rural


America.
 And
 so,
 if
 we're
 going
 to
 fix


those
 kinds
 of
 problems,
 which
 are


timeconuming,
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 get


Park
 Avenue
 psychiatrists
 to
 go
 practice


medicine.
 $800
 an
 hour


>> at
 $800
 bucks
 an
 hour
 in
 the
 North
 Slope


of
 of
 Alaska
 in
 the
 winter.
 It's
 just


not
 going
 to
 happen.
 And
 so
 this
 $50


billion
 investment
 that
 we
 as
 a
 country


just
 made
 just
 just
 I
 the
 money
 was
 part


of
 the
 rural
 health
 the
 the
 working


families
 tax
 uh
 cut
 legislation
 uh
 that


the
 president
 pushed
 through
 and


Congress
 got
 behind.
 $50
 billion
 the


largest
 investment
 ever
 made
 in
 rural


healthcare
 through
 our
 agency
 was
 given


up
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 calendar
 year.
 All


the
 governors
 have
 the
 money
 and
 we


charge
 them
 to
 make
 a
 difference
 in


their
 communities.
 You
 know,
 your


communities,
 they
 almost
 all
 came
 back


with
 some
 AI
 element.
 They
 all
 know
 to


really
 be
 able
 to
 get
 healthcare
 in


rural
 America,
 you've
 got
 to
 rightsize


the
 system.
 Right
 sizing
 the
 system


means,
 you
 know,
 you
 have
 hospitals


going
 to
 work
 out
 differently.
 Doctors


will
 work
 differently
 with
 each
 other.


But
 AI
 is
 the
 core
 element
 of
 so
 much


>> and
 these
 micro
 hospitals
 just
 like


people
 are
 putting
 ADU
 units
 in
 the
 back


of
 their
 homes
 to
 get
 an
 extra,
 you


know,
 apartment
 for
 grandma
 and
 grandpa


or
 as
 an
 Airbnb.
 My
 understanding
 is


there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 startups
 working
 on


the
 equivalent
 building
 a
 micro
 hospital


a
 room
 with
 the
 central
 services
 perhaps


a
 nurse
 practitioner
 uh
 who
 there's
 more


available
 and
 then
 you
 tele
 medicine
 in


just
 bringing
 the
 medicine
 to
 those


areas
 without
 having
 to
 build
 a
 giant


hospital
 is
 also
 a
 win
 yeah


>> the
 micro
 clinics
 I
 think
 a
 huge


opportunity
 to
 provide
 top
 tier
 care
 but


this
 goes
 beyond
 that
 we
 have
 AI


supported
 robots


>> that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 ultrasounds


in
 parts
 of
 Alabama
 where
 there
 are
 no


OBS,
 right?


>> We
 have
 drones
 delivering
 uh


prescription
 medications
 to
 the
 North


Slope
 of
 uh
 of
 Alaska,
 where
 there
 are


no
 roads,
 we
 have
 you
 have
 vending


machines
 that
 can
 dispense
 smart


dispensing
 of
 medications.
 By
 the
 way,


this
 is
 happening
 in
 other
 countries.


So,
 we
 want
 this
 to
 take
 place
 in


America.
 Why
 not
 take
 advantage
 of
 of
 an


opportunity
 through
 with
 a
 huge
 massive


inflow
 of
 money
 which
 the
 rural
 health


transformation
 fund
 does
 $50
 billion
 to


start
 to
 do
 some
 innovative
 work
 in


rural
 parts
 of
 the
 country
 which
 are
 the


the
 foundational
 element
 of
 who
 we
 are


as
 a
 nation.
 Those
 values
 ripple
 up
 to


the
 rest
 of
 us.
 I
 also
 think
 that
 states


now
 are
 talking
 to
 each
 other


differently.
 Now
 now
 that
 you
 got
 money


that's
 out
 there
 that
 can
 be
 used
 to


change
 the
 world.
 They
 start
 talking


about
 AI
 and
 technology
 generally
 very


differently.
 Now,
 it's
 not
 a
 it's
 it's


it's
 not
 a
 sparse
 research.
 We
 live
 in
 a


world
 of
 abundance.
 And
 AI
 makes
 it
 that


much
 more
 abundant
 if
 we
 use
 it


correctly.
 And
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 happen


today,
 but
 we
 believe
 by
 the
 time
 the


administration
 has
 completed
 this
 work,


we
 will
 have
 dramatically
 changed
 the


face
 of
 how
 Americans
 work
 with


information
 in
 the
 health
 care
 system.


Some
 of
 it's
 just
 blocking
 and
 tackling,


as
 you
 said,
 make
 medical
 record


companies,
 not
 data
 block.
 Some
 of
 it's


forcing
 uh
 health
 information
 systems
 to


share
 data
 more
 comfortably
 and


elegantly
 at
 a
 at
 a
 fair
 price.
 And
 part


of
 it's
 us
 putting
 money
 into
 the


system.
 seeding
 it
 the
 right
 way.
 Um
 but


the
 most
 important
 thing
 is
 to
 make
 it


safe
 to
 go
 outside.


>> Yeah.


>> We
 want
 to
 make
 it
 comfortable
 to
 take


financial
 risk
 to
 invest
 in
 these
 areas.


That's
 why
 600
 companies
 have
 invested.


Every
 major
 AI
 company,
 every
 major


foundational
 technology
 company,
 but
 all


a
 bunch
 of
 these
 surgeons
 that
 I
 that
 I


promised,
 they're
 all
 rushing
 in.


>> The
 three
 places
 entrepreneurs
 have
 been


reticent
 to
 uh
 take
 on
 uh
 to
 build
 new


products
 and
 services.
 Education,


housing,
 healthcare.
 These
 also
 happen


to
 be
 the
 ones
 most
 regulated,
 most


controlled
 by
 the
 government.
 So
 to
 the


extent
 you
 can
 give
 them
 access
 and
 make


it
 go
 faster,
 it's
 going
 to
 work.
 The


only
 investments
 we've
 ever
 made
 in


those
 spaces
 are
 ones
 that
 go
 direct
 to


consumer
 because
 we
 know
 going
 through


the
 government,
 there's
 just
 not
 enough


runway
 for
 those
 companies
 to
 get
 to
 the


other
 side.
 Let
 me
 ask
 you
 about


>> We're
 open
 for
 business.
 And
 I
 got
 to


make
 this
 plug
 while
 I'm
 here.
 We
 want


to
 work
 with
 industry.
 We
 believe
 the


private
 sector
 will
 come
 up
 with
 better


ideas.
 Come
 work
 with
 us.
 And
 we're
 also


looking
 for
 people
 and
 we
 we
 had
 nine


engineers.
 Nine
 engineers
 when
 we
 came


in
 and
 all
 of
 CMS
 the
 our
 cobalt
 based


infrastructure
 built
 in
 the
 70s
 where
 we


don't
 have
 engineers
 that


>> you're
 talking
 about
 in
 the
 department


you
 had
 nine
 engineers
 out
 of
 what's
 the


denominator
 of
 employees?


>> 6,500
 employees
 and
 40,000
 contractors.


So
 there's
 you
 basically
 have
 an
 HR


person
 in
 government
 working
 with
 a


government
 government
 affairs
 person
 at


the
 company.
 There's
 no
 engineers
 there.


>> 16
 basis
 points.
 David,


>> we
 took
 out
 we
 took
 $3
 billion
 of
 cost


out
 there.
 There
 was
 a
 company
 that
 we


fired
 that
 had
 build
 us
 $200
 million.


Not
 a
 single
 usable
 line
 of
 code.
 And


here's
 the
 good
 part.
 When
 we
 fired


them,
 you
 know
 what
 they
 said?
 Nothing.


>> Yeah,
 we
 knew
 it.
 We
 knew
 it.


>> Yeah,
 we
 were
 underperforming.
 No


accountability.


>> Underperforming.


>> God,
 we
 could
 go
 on
 about
 fraud
 for


forever.
 But
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 you
 about


this
 wonder
 drug.
 Four
 years
 ago,
 I
 was


listening
 to
 my
 friend
 uh
 Tim
 Ferris
 and


Kevin
 Rose
 who
 are
 biohackers
 and


they're
 always
 on
 the
 edge
 of
 this
 stuff


and
 he
 wanted
 to
 lose
 some
 visceral
 fat.


Kevin
 was
 in
 great
 shape
 and
 he
 heard


about
 this
 diabetes
 drug
 OMIC
 and
 that


he
 was
 going
 to
 give
 it
 a
 shot.
 He


dialed
 the
 pen
 all
 the
 way
 up,
 puked,


dialed
 it
 back
 down,
 lost
 his
 visceral


fat.
 I
 heard
 that
 I
 was
 like
 40.
 I
 was


213
 pounds
 at
 the
 time.
 Went
 to
 my


doctor.
 He
 said,
 "I
 have
 no
 idea
 what


you're
 talking
 about.
 You're
 not


diabetic,
 but
 you
 are
 fat."
 And
 I
 think


he
 said, "You're
 a
 fat
 bastard."
 I
 think


I
 said
 that.
 And
 I
 had
 just
 gained
 like


two
 or
 three
 pounds
 a
 year
 for
 20
 years.


And
 I
 used
 to
 be
 a
 marathon
 runner.
 I


used
 to
 be
 165,
 170
 lbs.
 So
 now
 172


gazelle
 right
 now
 by
 the
 way.


>> Well
 I
 add
 a
 little
 muscle
 too.
 Thank


you
 Dr.
 O.
 You
 look
 great
 too.
 Um
 but


this
 is
 a
 miracle
 drug.
 This
 in
 my
 mind


we
 now
 have
 theoretically
 tens
 of


millions
 of
 Americans
 have
 experienced


it.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 in
 pill
 format.
 The


the
 four
 uh
 horsemen
 of
 the
 apocalypse,


heart
 disease,


>> kidney
 failure,
 liver
 disease,
 dementia.


>> Dementia.
 These
 are
 all
 four
 of
 four
 are


impacted
 by
 obesity.
 and
 these
 GOP
 ones


seem
 to
 be
 impacting
 them.
 I
 was
 like,


you
 know
 what?
 If
 Trump
 just
 President


Trump
 just
 gave
 a
 national
 anybody
 can


get
 this
 drug
 if
 they
 want
 it,
 I
 think


he'd
 win
 the
 election.
 He
 won
 anyway.


Um,
 what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 a
 mandate
 to


make
 it
 available
 to
 make
 the
 fat
 drug


available
 for
 all
 Americans?
 Would
 that


be


>> So,
 I'm
 glad
 you
 came
 to
 work
 today.
 So,


uh,
 about
 two
 months
 ago
 in
 the
 Oval


Office,
 the
 president
 basically
 did


that.
 He
 said
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 take


the
 prices
 of
 these
 drugs,
 which
 are
 now


prohibitively
 high
 for
 many
 Americans,


$1,200
 cash
 pay.
 It's


>> crazy.


>> It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 starting
 price
 of


around
 $200.


>> Easy.


>> And
 u
 with
 the
 pills,
 it's
 $150
 and
 the


pills
 will
 come
 out.
 Uh
 the
 first
 FDA


approved
 pills
 will
 start
 this
 month.
 Um


and
 so
 we
 believe
 at
 that
 price


day


>> because
 think
 carefully.
 That's
 right.


It's
 a
 basically
 you
 get
 coffee
 a
 day.


At
 that
 price,
 we
 will
 within
 two
 years


return
 money
 to
 the
 American
 taxpayer.


It's
 going
 to
 save
 us
 so
 much
 money
 from


reducing
 hypertension,
 diabetes,
 and
 the


downstream
 illnesses,
 the
 four
 horsemen


of
 the
 apocalypse
 that
 you
 mentioned


that
 we
 will
 save
 money
 that
 we
 spend


over
 half
 the
 money
 we
 I
 believe
 within


health
 care
 on
 these
 chronic
 illnesses


driven
 by
 obesity.
 And
 so
 either


directly
 or
 indirectly
 because
 you
 hurt


your
 knees
 because
 you're
 overweight
 or


you
 get
 autoimmune
 problems
 or
 even


cancer
 is
 linked
 to
 obesity
 because
 you


have
 a
 metabolically
 active
 state.
 All


of
 these
 are
 going
 to
 drop


precipitously.
 We
 have
 pretty
 good
 data


on
 this
 from
 an
 internal
 modeling.
 So
 we


agreed
 to
 those
 prices
 with
 the
 two


major
 companies
 Novo
 Nordisk
 and
 Eli


Liy.
 We
 will
 launch
 next
 week.
 I
 don't


know
 when
 this
 podcast
 airs
 but
 launch


next
 week
 Trump
 RX
 with
 those
 products


so
 you
 can
 cash
 pay
 at
 a
 price
 that
 is


completely
 affordable.
 And
 here's
 the


good
 news.
 Every
 Medicare
 patient
 gets


it
 for
 $50
 co-pay.
 Every
 Medicaid


patient
 gets
 it
 for
 nothing.


>> Amazing.


>> So
 the
 people
 who
 need
 it
 the
 most,
 the


folks
 that
 are
 most
 vulnerable,
 this
 is


what
 it
 when
 people
 say
 the
 president


doesn't
 want
 to
 protect
 Medicaid,
 he


doesn't
 love
 and
 cherish
 Medicare.
 It


drives
 me
 bonkers
 because
 he's
 doing


more
 for
 underserved
 Americans
 than
 any


other
 president
 ever
 has.
 Giving


Americans
 where
 the
 obesity
 epidemic


lives,
 underserved
 Americans,
 you


vulnerable
 Americans
 who
 are
 on
 Medicaid


access
 to
 these
 drugs
 for
 no
 out-of-


pocket
 costs.
 truly
 democratizes
 the


weight
 loss
 issues
 because
 right
 now


what's
 the
 number
 one
 zip
 code
 for


weight
 loss
 drugs.
 Number
 one
 zip
 code


upper
 east
 side
 of
 Manhattan.


>> I
 was
 about
 to
 say
 it's
 got
 to
 be


Manhattan
 or
 LA.


>> LA
 is
 number
 two.


>> Okay.


>> Right.


>> Cuz
 people
 can
 afford
 it
 or


>> because
 they're
 vain.


>> They're
 vain.
 They
 want
 to
 lose
 two


pounds
 for
 their
 daughter's
 wedding
 and


they
 can
 afford
 it.
 $1,200
 a
 rounding


area.
 Yeah.
 Right.
 But
 $1,200
 for


someone
 that's
 not
 making
 money.
 You're


not
 you're
 just
 not
 going
 to
 take
 the


drug
 and
 they're
 the
 ones
 that
 die


early.
 The
 life
 expectancy
 in
 rural


America,
 I'll
 go
 back
 to
 them
 in


vulnerable
 populations
 9
 years
 shorter


than
 yours
 in
 the
 same
 country.


>> It's
 something
 that
 came
 out
 of
 left


field.
 What
 does
 that
 tell
 us
 about


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 in
 medicine
 going


forward?
 Because
 GLPS,


how
 long
 of
 a
 journey
 has
 that
 been
 and


then
 getting
 to
 market
 and
 then
 you
 know


this
 off
 label
 use
 starting
 with
 people


with
 diabetes.
 What
 is
 that?
 What
 is


that?
 How
 does
 that
 inform
 you
 of
 how
 we


can
 make
 even
 more
 impact
 in
 the
 future?


How
 do
 we
 make
 another
 GLP
 like


discovery
 and
 implement
 it
 the
 way


President
 Trump
 has?


>> Well,
 this,
 you
 know,
 the
 drug
 actually


came,
 it's
 a
 poisonous
 uh
 chemical,
 a


venom
 actually,
 that
 was
 uh
 deciphered


and
 found
 to
 have
 an
 impact
 on
 some
 of


these
 core
 cells
 in
 the
 in
 the
 the


appetite
 system
 of
 the
 body,
 which
 is
 so


fundamental
 to
 who
 we
 are
 that
 it's
 very


hard
 to
 hack
 the
 appetite.
 But
 GLP-1s


are
 just
 the
 tip
 of
 the
 iceberg.
 There


are
 more
 and
 more
 sophisticated
 ways
 for


us
 to
 be
 able
 to
 address
 not
 just


appetite
 but
 addiction,
 addictive


behavior
 drops
 at
 GLP-1s.
 So
 the
 newer


drugs
 are
 going
 to
 be
 even
 more


effective
 at
 that.


>> Red
 True
 Tide
 is
 the
 one

>> for
 example,
 Red
 Tide.
 But
 the
 other


thing
 I
 would
 say
 is
 the
 form
 factor


matters
 in
 sending
 someone
 an
 injection


that's
 that
 goes
 bad
 in
 the
 warm
 weather


that
 a
 lot
 of
 wastage
 and
 you
 don't
 know


the
 exact
 dose.
 the
 pills
 make
 it
 like


most
 other
 drugs
 and
 now
 the
 drug
 the


price
 point
 is
 much
 lower
 as
 well.
 So


it's
 easier
 for
 us
 to
 deliver
 that
 at


scale
 to
 the
 American
 people.
 So
 it
 does


leapfrog
 us
 beyond
 today's
 problems
 and


this
 is
 a
 big
 theme
 of
 our


administration.
 Don't
 bother
 fixing


today's
 broken
 pipes
 if
 the
 world
 you're


building
 doesn't
 have
 pipes


>> and
 that's
 what
 we're
 doing
 with
 drugs


like
 semagutide
 and
 interzepide
 which
 is


the
 the
 lily
 product.
 We're
 also
 getting


these
 companies
 to
 unshore
 their


production
 facility
 hire
 American


workers
 stay
 innovative.
 This
 is
 why


again
 the
 president
 doesn't
 want
 us


hurting
 innovation.
 With
 the
 same
 day
 we


did
 the
 first
 most
 favored
 nation
 drug


um
 event,
 we
 had
 an
 executive
 order
 on


childhood
 cancer.
 20
 beautiful
 children,


smiley
 bright
 eyes,
 all
 of
 whom
 all
 of


whom
 should
 have
 been
 ghosts.
 They


survived
 because
 technologies
 were


afforded
 to
 them.
 Don't
 exist
 in
 other


parts
 of
 the
 world
 to
 keep
 them
 alive.


That's
 our
 goal.
 But
 I
 need
 to
 I'd
 be


poorly
 served.
 I
 hear
 the
 bell
 tolling


if
 I
 didn't
 get
 into
 the
 other


>> for
 whom
 we
 don't
 know.
 We
 probably


asked
 for
 the
 belt
 holes
 for
 sure
 for


you,
 Jac.
 But


>> I
 think
 that's
 all
 I
 think
 that's


totally
 for
 the
 pharma
 companies
 who


don't
 bend
 the
 knee.


>> No,
 actually,
 but
 the
 the
 the
 the
 issue


right
 now
 that
 is
 consuming
 us
 is
 the


fraud,
 the
 waste
 and
 abuse.
 And


>> what
 have
 you
 found,
 Dr.
 Oz?
 Tell
 us


what
 is
 the
 most
 concerning
 to
 you?


>> Well,
 let
 me
 as
 a
 preamble
 w
 without
 a


better
 visibility
 into
 where
 the
 money


is
 spent,
 which
 we
 need
 technology
 to
 be


able
 to
 do


>> or
 audits.
 Well,
 audits
 are
 interesting.


You
 can
 audit
 the
 spreadsheet.
 You
 can't


tell
 if
 the
 input
 to
 the
 spreadsheet
 was


legitimate
 unless
 you
 actually
 go
 and
 do


site
 visits,
 and
 states
 don't
 want
 to
 do


that.
 So,
 let
 me
 just
 give
 it


>> Are
 they
 blocking
 it
 these
 states?


>> Of
 course.
 First
 of
 all,
 let
 me
 just


I'll
 tell
 you
 that's
 a
 good
 question.


Why
 would
 you
 let
 fraud
 happen?
 It
 is
 by


federal
 law,
 by
 federal
 law
 mandated


that
 if
 you
 give
 a
 patient
 a
 welfare


program,
 SNAP,
 uh,
 Medicaid,
 you
 must


also
 give
 them
 the
 ability
 to
 sign
 up
 to


vote.
 So
 you're
 basically
 recruiting


voters
 at
 the
 same
 time
 you're
 giving


them
 free
 government
 services
 which
 then


you
 might
 actually
 end
 up
 recruiting
 a


different
 kind
 of
 voter
 like
 you
 don't


have
 a
 law
 that
 if
 you
 go
 to
 an
 NRA


convention
 uh
 right
 for
 for
 you
 know
 gun


advocates
 that
 you
 sign
 up
 voters
 right


you
 can
 go
 to
 that
 event
 not
 get
 signed


up
 to
 vote
 obviously
 they
 would
 be


probably
 skewing
 to
 the
 right
 so
 there


is
 an
 issue
 there
 we
 also
 have
 an
 active


role
 of
 unions
 especially
 in
 California


where
 we
 have
 a
 a
 major
 problem
 because


the
 unions
 have
 seemed
 This
 is
 all
 what


I'm
 hearing
 from
 talking
 to
 people
 on


the
 ground
 seem
 to
 have
 gotten
 involved


in,
 for
 example,
 signing
 up
 home
 health


care
 workers
 and
 and
 personal
 care


services.
 There
 are
 more
 Americans,
 I


believe,
 providing
 some
 of
 these


homebased
 services
 that
 maybe
 might


exist
 in
 retail
 in
 America.
 We've


shifted
 the
 entire
 employment
 economy


towards
 some
 of
 these
 services.
 And


here's
 the
 risk.
 If
 you
 really
 want
 to


understand
 why
 we
 have
 fraud
 in
 America,


when
 I
 give
 you
 things
 that
 your
 family


used
 to
 give
 you,
 we
 are
 going
 to
 have


fraud.
 So,
 your
 family
 used
 to
 drive
 you


to
 the
 doctor's
 office.
 Your
 family


would
 take
 you
 home
 after
 you
 got
 home


back
 from
 the
 hospital
 to
 make
 sure
 you


got
 well
 nourished
 and
 taken
 care
 of.


Your
 family
 would
 carry
 the
 groceries
 up


the
 stairs.
 Your
 family
 would
 negotiate


your
 contract
 with
 the
 landlord.
 Guess


what?
 Healthy
 human
 services
 does
 all


that
 for
 you
 now.
 All
 you
 got
 to
 do
 is


ask.
 And
 in
 some
 states,
 it's
 so
 easy
 to


do
 that
 you
 end
 up
 with
 significant


fraud.
 We


>> So,
 they
 have
 intercepted
 the


transaction.
 Therefore,
 that's
 where


grift
 can
 occur
 and
 fraud.


>> Well,
 the
 government's
 paying
 for
 it,


>> right?
 So
 when
 the
 consumer
 is
 paying


for
 it
 out
 of
 their
 own
 pocket,
 they


have
 their
 own
 incentive
 to
 get
 value


for
 the
 transaction.


>> But
 when
 the
 government's
 paying
 for
 it,


who
 really
 has
 the
 incentive
 to
 make


sure
 that
 value
 has
 been
 provided
 in


exchange
 for
 that
 money?
 Yeah.
 And
 this


is
 what
 happened
 in
 Minnesota
 where
 you


had
 a
 subculture.
 It
 was
 prim,
 you
 know,


just
 the
 mathematically
 most
 of
 the


indictments
 with
 are
 with
 Somalians.
 So


the
 Somalian
 community
 realized,
 hey,
 my


goodness,
 no
 one's
 watching.


>> Now
 there's
 an
 adage,
 you
 know,
 that


only
 the
 morons
 get
 caught
 in
 healthcare


fraud
 because
 it's
 so
 easy
 to
 do.
 And
 if


if
 you
 get
 you
 steal
 $5
 million
 uh
 in


medic
 in
 Medicare
 Medicaid,
 you
 go
 to


jail
 for
 18
 months.
 I
 mean,
 for
 many


people,
 that's
 a
 pretty
 good
 deal.


>> Yeah.


>> You,
 you
 know,
 sit
 in
 the
 pen
 for
 18


months.
 But
 unfortunately,
 I'll
 just


give
 you
 a
 lay of
 the
 land.
 There
 are


twice
 as
 many
 durable
 medical
 equipment


providers.
 They
 sell
 wheelchairs
 and


knee
 braces.
 Twi
 there's
 actually
 20


times
 more
 in
 South
 Florida
 than


McDonald's.
 I
 mean,
 how
 many
 do
 you


need?
 Turns
 out
 they're
 all
 Cuban
 pretty


much.
 They
 all
 seem
 to
 fly
 back
 to
 Cuba


and
 escape,
 you
 know,
 law
 enforcement.


They
 They
 build
 millions
 of
 dollars.


They
 get
 away
 with
 it.
 There


>> what's
 the
 solution?
 There's
 got
 to
 be


really
 practical,
 easy
 solution.


>> There
 are,
 but
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 share


that,
 but
 let
 me
 just
 give
 you
 two


others
 because
 you
 would
 remember
 these.


We
 have
 seven
 times
 more
 hospice
 in


California.
 Hospice
 is
 for
 people
 at
 the


end
 of
 their
 life.
 Seven
 times
 more


hospice
 than
 was
 there
 five,
 six,
 seven


years
 ago.
 Seven
 times
 more.
 We
 don't


have
 that
 many
 people
 dying
 in


California.
 And
 more
 importantly,
 the


survival
 rates
 on
 hospice,
 again,


designed
 for
 cancer
 patients
 dying


within
 six
 months.
 The
 survival
 rate
 for


most
 of
 these
 hospice
 centers
 is
 100%.


>> Wait
 a
 second.


>> They
 shouldn't
 have
 gone
 to
 hospice.


>> Exactly.


>> Is
 the
 government
 paying
 for
 it?


>> Yes.
 Completely
 paying
 for
 it.
 But
 no


one's
 dying
 because
 you're
 not
 supposed


to.


>> When
 did
 the
 government
 start
 paying
 for


that?


>> Oh,
 40
 years
 ago.
 Okay.
 It
 was
 designed.


>> And
 then
 what
 happened
 in
 the
 last
 seven


or
 10
 that
 the
 fraud
 just
 went
 foreign


governments
 got
 involved
 in
 LA?
 The


hospice
 is
 driven
 by
 the
 Russian


Armenian
 gangs.
 They're
 foreign


nationals.
 They
 fly
 back
 to
 Russia.
 We


had
 a
 big
 $15
 billion
 bust
 on
 these
 guys


earlier
 in
 the
 year.
 Again,
 they
 all


escape.
 The
 other
 thing
 is
 no
 one's


watching
 because
 there's
 a
 opportunity


if
 you
 get
 into
 these
 businesses
 to
 make


a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 it
 becomes
 I'll
 give


you
 I'll
 just
 tell
 you
 a
 true
 story


about
 uh
 a
 whistleblower.
 Again,
 I
 I


can't
 prove
 this,
 but
 it's
 what
 he
 said.


He
 said
 that
 he
 uh
 he
 was
 building
 a


beautiful
 mansion.
 He
 owns
 all
 these


hospices.
 He's
 a
 doctor,
 but
 he's
 a


fraudster.
 Uh
 and
 so
 he
 built
 this
 puer


house.
 They
 the
 plumber
 comes
 in
 and


says,
 "Hey,
 you
 know,
 I
 hear
 you
 in
 the


hospice
 space."
 The
 guy
 says,
 "Yeah,
 I


made
 my
 money
 in
 hospice."
 that
 the


plumber
 says,
 "You
 know,
 I've
 got
 a
 side


hustle.
 I
 own
 a
 hospice,
 too."


>> Right?
 Then
 the
 carpenter
 hears
 him
 and


he
 says,
 "Me,
 too.
 I'm
 in
 the
 hospice


business.
 We're
 all
 in
 the
 hospice


business."
 Absolutely.


>> So
 then
 the
 guy
 says,
 "Okay,
 well,
 he


realized
 he's
 got
 to
 get
 ahead
 of
 these


guys."
 So
 he
 goes
 to
 a
 a
 major
 hospital


in
 LA
 and
 a
 doctor
 at
 the
 hospital,
 very


prominent
 hospital
 that
 everyone's
 heard


of,
 says,
 "Hey,
 listen.
 You,
 if
 you
 give


me
 $1,000
 a
 month,
 I'll
 send
 hospice


patients
 to
 you."
 Which
 is
 how
 it's
 done


in
 LA,
 by
 the
 way.
 You
 get
 paid,
 this


you
 send
 patients
 over.
 So
 the
 guy
 says,


"Okay,
 but
 what
 about
 the
 actual


inpatients
 like
 the
 people
 hospitalized?


Can
 I
 get
 them?"
 They
 got
 and
 the
 doctor


says,
 "I
 can't
 do
 that
 because
 it
 turns


out
 the
 members
 some
 there
 are
 some


members
 of
 the
 board
 that
 own
 hospice


and
 they
 like
 the
 patients
 to
 go
 to


their
 centers."


>> You
 see
 that
 the
 corruption
 starts
 in
 in


organized
 crime,
 but
 if
 you
 tolerate
 it,


it
 poisons
 the
 whole
 system.


>> And
 that's
 the
 bigger
 reason
 we've
 got
 a


problem.
 So
 what
 are
 we
 doing?
 We
 have
 a


fraud
 uh
 war
 room.
 Uh
 I'm
 going
 to
 put
 a


moratorum
 on
 some
 of
 these
 services.


We're
 not
 going to
 let
 new
 people
 sign


up.
 Uh
 we're
 going
 to
 actively
 and


aggressively
 stop
 paying
 Medicaid
 uh
 if


we
 can
 prove
 that
 states
 are
 not


obliging
 their
 fiduciary
 responsibility


to
 the
 American
 people
 because
 states


administer
 Medicaid.
 I
 pay
 the
 bills
 at


CMS.
 So,
 we're
 going
 to
 stop
 paying
 on


behalf
 of
 the
 taxpayer
 if
 we
 don't
 think


you're
 taking
 care
 of
 the
 money.


>> And
 people
 should
 know
 there
 are


whistleblower
 laws
 where
 you
 get
 a


percentage
 of
 whatever
 is
 reported
 and


they
 should
 look
 into
 that.
 And
 the
 fact


that
 we
 have
 so
 many
 people
 in
 the


administration
 now
 communicating
 that,


hey,
 we
 want
 to
 have
 you
 report
 fraud
 to


us
 has
 changed
 everything.
 The
 number
 of


people
 reporting
 fraud
 must
 have
 gone
 up


since


>> dramatically.
 People
 in
 the
 government,


this
 is
 probably,
 you
 know,
 the
 part


that's
 most
 rewarding
 to
 me.
 Many


government
 workers
 are
 Democrats.


Probably
 most


>> what
 they
 tell
 me
 again
 and
 again
 is


they
 just
 came
 to
 government
 to
 do
 their


job.
 They
 wanted
 to
 do
 the
 right
 thing


>> and
 and
 they
 were
 told
 not
 to
 do
 their


job.
 They
 were
 told
 not
 to
 focus
 on
 the


fraud,
 to
 focus
 on
 getting
 more
 people


signed
 up.
 But
 if
 you
 don't
 take
 care
 of


the
 fraud,
 this
 is
 an
 important
 message.


You
 will
 kill
 the
 system.
 Eventually,


you
 will
 destroy
 Medicaid.
 And
 I'm
 not


going
 to
 let
 that
 happen
 on
 our
 watch.


Medicaid,
 as
 Hubert
 Humphrey
 said,
 is


there
 to
 protect
 those
 at
 the
 dawn
 of


life,
 which
 are
 our
 children.
 53%
 of


kids
 are
 born
 into
 poverty.
 We
 take
 care


of
 them.
 Those
 at
 the
 twilight
 of
 life,


those
 are
 the
 seniors,
 right?
 We
 owe
 it


to
 them.
 Every
 great
 society
 takes
 care


of
 the
 most
 vulnerable.
 We're
 great


people
 will
 do
 that.
 And
 he
 Hubert


Humphrey
 said
 you
 got
 to
 take
 care
 of


those
 living
 in
 the
 shadows.
 We
 are
 not


going
 to
 let
 them
 get
 hurt.
 When
 you
 let


organized
 criminal
 elements
 steal
 at


scale
 from
 the
 federal
 government,
 you


are
 killing
 those
 programs.
 We
 now
 have


so
 many
 kids
 signed
 up
 falsely
 for


autism
 that
 the
 kids
 with
 autism
 aren't


getting
 access
 to
 care.


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 the
 incredibly
 frustrating


thing.
 Having
 talked
 to
 some
 young


parents
 who
 are
 millennials,
 Gen
 Z,


they're
 going
 to
 work.
 They
 got
 two


jobs.
 They
 would
 love
 to
 have
 child


care,
 but
 the
 child
 care
 dollars
 are


being
 stolen.
 Therefore,
 they
 can't


access
 them.
 And
 the
 same
 thing's


happening
 across
 the
 system.
 I
 think


this
 could
 be
 just
 such
 a
 defining


moment
 for
 America
 because
 on
 the
 other


side,
 we
 have
 socialists,
 lunatic


communists
 running
 some
 of
 these
 cities


who
 want
 to
 seize
 people's
 assets,
 want


to
 raise
 taxes
 before
 fixing
 fraud.
 This


is
 like
 pouring
 water
 into
 a
 a
 leaky


bucket.
 Well,
 you're
 talking
 about


California


>> and
 New
 York.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 couldn't
 help
 but
 notice


that
 Gavin
 Newsome
 arrived
 here
 at
 Davos


yesterday.


>> He's
 here.


>> Yeah.
 He
 was
 encouraging
 European


leaders
 to
 defy
 President
 Trump,
 which


is
 a
 weird
 thing
 for
 a
 governor
 to
 come


here
 to


>> to
 basically
 uh
 advocate
 for
 foreign


leaders
 to
 defy
 the
 American.


>> What
 next?
 like
 partner
 with
 communist


countries
 for
 your
 f
 I
 mean


>> but
 I
 think
 honestly
 it's
 all
 a


distraction
 because
 the
 the
 real
 thing


happening
 in
 California
 right
 now
 is


everybody
 knows
 there's
 massive
 fraud


there
 you
 see
 that
 image
 on
 the
 internet


where
 it's
 an
 iceberg
 and


>> the
 tip
 is
 Minnesota
 but
 California
 is


the
 fourth
 largest
 economy
 in
 the
 world


so
 we
 know
 there's
 massive
 fraud
 I
 think


Newsome
 knows
 there's
 massive
 fraud
 too


that's
 that's
 why
 he's
 vetoed


>> audits


>> I
 mean
 can
 we
 just
 pause
 for
 a
 second


audit


>> veto
 audits
 Right.


>> Who
 would
 veto
 an
 audit?


>> Someone
 doesn't
 want
 to
 get
 caught.


>> A
 criminal.
 A
 criminal
 would
 veto
 it.


I'm
 not
 saying
 he's
 a
 criminal,
 but


>> No,
 this
 is
 to
 government
 spending
 what


the
 ban
 on
 voter
 ID
 is
 to
 elections.


>> Why
 wouldn't


>> you
 only
 do
 that?
 You
 you
 you're
 banning


the
 thing
 that
 helps
 you
 catch
 the


fraud.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 why
 would
 you
 ever
 do
 that
 unless
 you


want
 the
 fraud
 to
 happen?


>> Exactly.
 It's
 it's
 Yeah.
 It's
 still


>> now
 and
 now
 even


>> distraati
 as
 we
 say
 here.
 But
 California


the
 budget's
 $350
 billion
 by
 far
 the


biggest.


>> It
 has
 doubled
 in
 the
 last
 decade


>> and
 it's
 like
 three
 times
 per
 capita


>> two
 and
 a
 half
 times
 the
 inflation
 rate.


Okay.
 And
 they're
 still
 running
 a
 huge


deficit.
 And
 that's
 why
 they're
 now


driving
 all
 the
 job
 creators
 out
 of
 the


state
 with
 this
 proposed
 asset
 seizure.


Wild.


>> If
 they
 just
 clamp
 down
 on
 the
 fraud,


they
 wouldn't
 have
 this
 hole
 in
 their


budget.
 Just
 LA
 County
 alone,
 just
 in


hospice
 and
 home
 health
 care,
 we
 believe


it's
 about
 three
 and a
 half
 billion


dollars.
 Just
 in
 those
 two
 programs
 in


one
 city,
 there's
 probably
 10%
 of
 all


home
 healthcare
 expense
 in
 America
 is
 in


LA.
 So
 there's
 so
 much
 to
 do
 to
 improve


the
 system
 that
 would
 restore


confidence.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 governors


who
 are
 unwilling
 to
 do
 their
 job,
 and


it
 does
 make
 people
 think
 that
 listen,


when
 smart
 people
 don't
 do
 things,
 it's


not
 an
 accident.
 right?


>> They're
 not
 doing
 these
 things
 because


they
 have
 ulterior
 motives
 that
 either


aren't
 transparent
 to
 you
 or
 they
 think


you're
 not
 smart
 enough
 to
 figure
 out.


We
 had
 to
 ask
 those
 questions.
 This


president
 is
 not
 going
 to
 tolerated,
 but


the
 American
 people
 shouldn't
 either.


>> We
 had
 an
 interesting
 moment.
 Uh
 our


friend
 Elon
 Musk
 had
 asked
 us
 after
 he


purchased
 Twitter
 now
 X
 to
 come
 in
 and


we
 were
 looking
 at
 the
 bills
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 how
 this
 company
 was


hemorrhaging
 cash
 at
 a
 level
 that
 just


didn't
 even
 seem
 possible.
 And
 one
 of


the
 things
 was
 they
 had
 just
 signed
 up


for
 tons
 of
 software
 and
 you
 know


basically
 subscriptions
 and
 uh
 CFO
 comes


in,
 auditor
 comes
 in,
 we're
 all
 trying


to
 figure
 it
 out
 and
 Elon
 said
 that


Twitter
 and
 Elon
 says
 um


>> how
 are
 they
 paying
 all
 these?
 They're


like
 oh
 yeah
 they're
 on
 credit
 cards.
 He


said
 okay
 um
 cancel
 all
 the
 cards.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 we
 said
 they're
 like
 yeah
 cancel


the
 cards.


Immediately
 I
 get
 three
 back
 channels


from
 software
 companies
 who
 are
 like
 hey


um
 I
 know
 you're
 helping
 Elon.
 I
 saw
 a


story
 in
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 Um,
 our


bill
 stopped
 getting
 paid.
 Can
 we
 come


in?
 And
 I'm
 like,
 yeah,
 we're
 not
 using


your
 software
 anymore.
 Nobody's
 ever


used
 it's
 never
 been
 installed.
 The


software
 had
 been
 You
 want
 to
 talk
 about


fraud
 at
 a
 scale
 that
 was
 deranged?


>> This
 is
 a
 private
 company,
 not
 a
 private


company.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 your
 point
 is,
 look,
 when
 when
 no


one
 is
 minding
 the
 store,
 bad
 things
 are


going
 to
 happen.
 And
 when
 no
 one
 has


minded
 the
 store
 for
 decades
 and
 the


government's
 paying
 for
 it,
 you
 don't


even
 have
 that
 private
 sector
 profit


motive
 to
 basically
 be
 efficient.
 Then


think
 about
 how
 the
 fraud
 just


metastasizes.
 It's
 got
 to
 be


>> 20
 30%


>> hundreds
 of
 billions.


>> It's
 got
 to
 be
 a
 double
 digit.
 I'm
 going


to
 guess
 20
 30%
 of
 all
 these
 fraud.


>> All
 it
 took
 was
 a
 YouTuber
 with
 a
 video


camera
 to
 actually
 show
 up.
 Yeah.


>> At
 the
 Minnesota
 daycare
 centers
 that


were
 receiving
 millions
 of
 Learing


center.
 Yeah,
 the
 the
 Learing
 Center.


They're
 all
 empty.
 Yeah.


>> Dozens
 of
 them.
 Each
 one's
 receiving


millions
 of
 dollars.


>> And
 that's
 one
 program
 in
 one
 state.
 And


these
 aren't
 low
 lives
 doing
 this.
 The


lives
 are
 involved
 obviously,
 but
 these


are
 politically
 connected
 groups.


>> Sophisticated.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 why
 I'm
 emphasizing


these
 are
 government,
 foreign


governmentbacked
 efforts
 at
 times,
 but


certainly
 the
 people
 doing
 them
 are


often
 foreign
 nationals.
 And
 we
 are


being
 taken
 advantage
 of
 because
 we're


like
 a
 big
 hippopotamus.
 You
 know,
 all


you
 need
 to
 penetrate
 Medicare
 and


Medicaid
 is
 a
 beneficiary
 number.
 they


can
 buy
 those
 and
 you're
 off
 to
 the


races.
 So,
 the
 solutions
 are
 I'm
 not


claiming
 they're
 simple,
 but
 they're


eminently
 doable,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 expect


it
 of
 your
 leaders.


>> There's
 going
 to
 be
 some
 low
 hanging


fruit
 here.
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 you
 cutting


off
 payments
 and
 saying
 very
 simply,


hey,
 we've
 cut
 off
 payments.
 All
 you


have
 to
 do
 is
 sign
 this
 attestation
 that


you
 delivered
 the
 service
 and
 I
 would


like
 you
 to
 attach
 your
 driver's
 license


and
 passport
 to
 it
 and
 um
 by
 the
 way,


you've
 been
 randomly
 selected
 to
 come


into
 the
 office.
 We
 want
 to
 hear
 all


about
 what
 you're
 doing
 and
 jump
 on
 a


Zoom
 call.


>> Right.
 So,
 you're
 saying
 cancel
 the


credit
 cards.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then


>> and
 just
 let
 them
 then
 reopen
 the


account
 or
 tell
 you.


>> Yeah.
 Come
 in.
 Yeah.
 We
 just
 want
 to


reverify
 what's
 going
 on.
 Literally


>> zero
 baseline
 budgeting.
 Not
 saying
 the


program
 is
 over.
 And
 that's
 the
 thing


that
 that
 I
 think
 Elon
 found
 when
 he
 was


doing
 Doge
 is
 these
 payments
 were
 just


on
 recurring
 autopay
 every
 year.


>> Autopay
 equals


>> with
 no
 with
 no
 code
 explaining
 what
 the


money
 was
 going
 to.


>> Autopay
 equals
 from
 that.
 That's
 all
 you


have
 to
 know.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 like


some
 of
 the
 great
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 want
 to


talk
 about
 like
 some
 of
 the
 good
 stuff


Lena
 Khan
 did
 and
 I
 was
 opposed
 to
 about


80%
 of
 it.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 she
 did


that
 was
 really
 well
 was
 she
 said
 if
 you


sign
 up
 for
 a
 service
 you
 have
 to
 be


able
 to
 cancel
 it
 the
 same
 way
 you


signed
 up.
 So
 newspapers


these
 bastions
 of
 virtue
 you'd
 sign
 up


for
 Wall
 Street
 Journal.
 You
 probably


have
 had
 this
 experience.
 You
 try
 to


cancel
 it.
 They're
 like
 give
 us
 a
 call


and
 then
 they
 you're
 on
 the
 phone
 for
 an


hour
 just
 want
 to
 cancel
 it.
 And
 I
 asked


the
 woman,
 I
 said,
 "Uh,
 hey,
 can
 I
 ask


you
 just
 a
 simple
 question,
 um,
 why


can't
 I
 just
 cancel
 online?"
 They're


like,
 "Oh,
 well,
 because
 of
 fraud."
 I'm


like,
 "But
 you
 took
 my
 money
 through
 the


website,
 so
 that's
 where
 the
 fraud
 would


actually
 occur."
 She's
 like,
 "Yeah,
 that


kind
 of
 makes
 sense,
 but
 I'm
 just
 an


operator,
 Mr.
 Calican."
 They
 said,


"Okay,
 fine."
 But
 that
 this
 is
 the
 same


concept,
 which
 is
 if
 you
 want
 the
 money,


hey,
 why
 don't
 you
 come
 into
 the
 office


and
 we'd
 love
 to
 hear
 how
 the
 program's


going.
 We
 got
 your
 check
 right
 here.


Come
 pick
 it
 up
 in
 person.
 Want
 to
 hear


about
 it.
 And
 uh
 can
 you
 just
 take
 a


picture
 of
 the
 service
 you
 provided?


Just
 taking
 a
 picture
 of
 the
 service
 you


provided
 and
 then
 send
 it
 in.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 is
 this
 hard?


>> And
 like
 you
 said,
 how
 do
 you
 argue
 for


you?
 California
 already
 has
 some
 of
 the


highest
 tax
 rates
 in
 the
 nation.
 And
 now


you're
 arguing
 for
 more
 taxes,
 novel


taxes,
 taxes
 that
 no
 one's
 ever
 seen.


>> Unconstitutional.


>> Unconstitutional
 probably.
 And
 will


require
 a
 massive
 new
 enforcement


mechanism.
 Before
 you
 do
 that,
 you


haven't
 even
 rung
 the
 obvious
 fraud
 out


of
 the
 system.


>> Yeah.
 Listen,
 our
 biggest
 allies,
 our


state
 auditors.
 I
 met
 with
 the
 state


auditor
 in
 Minnesota.
 Uh
 confided
 that,


you
 know,
 she's
 been
 trying
 to
 get
 this


on
 the
 radar.
 Uh
 just
 people
 didn't
 want


to
 listen.
 And
 I
 talked
 to
 folks
 within


the
 agency,
 Healthy
 Human
 Services.
 U


you
 were
 shuttled
 around.
 Uh
 one
 woman


was
 actually
 escorted
 out
 of
 the


building
 for
 raising
 the
 reality
 that


there
 was
 fraud.
 And
 this
 happened
 over


several
 years.
 And
 eventually
 either
 you


leave
 if
 you're
 ethical
 or
 you
 be
 you're


quiet
 because
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 get


fired.
 And
 you
 make
 it
 such
 a
 a
 harsh


environment
 for
 anybody
 to
 just
 tell
 the


truth.
 This
 reminds
 me
 of
 a
 friend
 of


mine
 who
 was
 uh
 he's
 a
 billionaire
 now.


Tomas
 Pedy,
 you
 probably
 know
 him,


Interactive
 Brokers.
 Uh
 really
 really


great
 guy.
 And
 he
 said
 he
 was
 growing


growing
 up
 in
 Hungary
 and
 he
 said
 when


he
 was
 young
 he
 knew
 that
 everyone
 was


lying
 to
 him.


>> But
 that
 wasn't
 the
 big
 problem.
 The
 big


problem
 is
 he
 knew
 that
 they
 knew
 that


he
 knew
 that
 they
 were
 lying
 to
 him,


>> right?


>> So
 pretty
 soon
 we
 are
 all
 in
 on
 the
 fact


that
 there's
 a
 big
 lie.


>> The
 whole
 thing
 is
 corrupt.
 And
 so


working
 in
 these
 agencies,
 the
 good


people
 are
 weeded
 out.
 The
 people
 who


are
 left
 either
 don't
 care,
 aren't
 good


people,


>> or
 complicit.


>> And
 some
 of
 them
 are
 complicit.
 But
 I


think
 fundamentally
 there
 was
 a


misalignment
 of
 values.
 And
 this


actually
 was
 probably
 the
 most
 important


thing
 we
 had
 to
 do
 in
 that
 legislation


last
 year,
 the
 working
 families
 tax
 cut


legislation.
 We
 had
 to
 align
 the


president
 with
 the
 governors.
 There
 were


so
 many
 ways
 of
 getting
 this
 the
 federal


government
 to
 give
 you
 money
 that
 wasn't


really
 yours.
 legalized
 moneyaundering


schemes,
 all
 kinds
 of
 things
 that
 clever


consultants
 had
 figured
 out
 over
 the


years
 that
 we
 estimated
 we
 would
 have


lost
 5.4
 trillion
 dollars
 just
 for


Medicaid,
 which
 is
 again
 why
 I
 often


joke
 we
 were
 becoming
 one
 massive
 health


care
 system
 with
 a
 small
 country


attached.


>> Well,
 and
 if
 it
 doesn't
 work
 long
 term,


if
 we
 don't
 take
 bold
 action,
 which


again
 a
 major
 message
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 things


the
 president
 is
 doing,
 if
 you
 don't


take
 bold
 action
 on
 some
 of
 these


issues,
 you're
 leaving
 our
 the
 next


generation
 with
 a
 train
 wreck.
 They


can't
 fix
 it
 anymore
 because
 the
 train's


gone
 way
 off
 the
 rails.
 Yeah.
 And
 just


think
 of
 the
 absolute
 hypocrisy.
 You


have
 someone
 like
 Mandami
 who
 says
 he


wants
 to
 increase
 services,
 provide
 more


for
 the
 citizens
 and
 they're
 not
 doing


the
 audits.
 They're
 not
 fighting
 fraud.


Gavin
 Newsome
 is
 talking
 about
 wanting


to
 provide
 more
 for
 the
 bottom
 half
 of


society,
 but
 not
 doing
 the
 audits.


>> And
 frankly,
 this
 whole
 budget
 hole
 that


is
 causing
 this
 now
 acid
 seizure
 tax,
 it


all
 started
 in
 2022


>> when
 Newsome
 promised
 medical
 for
 all


including
 illegal
 aliens.
 And
 so
 what


happened
 is
 in
 big
 beautiful
 bill


president
 said
 listen
 we're
 not
 going
 to


reimburse
 for
 illegal
 aliens
 like


>> think
 about
 incentives
 there


>> right
 so
 then
 the
 SEIU
 uh
 the
 health


worker
 union


>> they're
 upset
 because
 they
 don't
 want


that
 funding
 cut
 because
 it
 indirectly


impacts
 them.
 So
 that's
 how
 this
 whole


thing
 happened.
 Think
 about
 the
 layers


of
 fraud
 there
 that
 you've
 got
 you
 know


the
 the
 government
 the
 government
 of


California
 is
 paying
 for
 illegal
 aliens


probably
 shouldn't
 be
 doing
 that.
 I


mean,
 if
 you
 ask
 the
 American
 people,


which
 is
 who
 you
 both
 work
 for,
 how
 many


Americans
 believe
 that
 illegal
 aliens


should
 get
 universal
 healthcare,
 I
 think


you're
 going
 to
 get
 like
 98%


are
 going
 to
 say
 absolutely
 not.
 And
 the


2%
 with
 purple
 hair
 in
 Berkeley
 who
 want


it.
 I


>> I
 don't
 know
 what
 what
 their
 motivation


is.


>> Support
 them.
 Just
 to
 finish
 the
 point,


if
 you
 are
 going
 to
 have
 the
 politics
 of


a
 Gavin
 Newsome
 and
 you're
 going
 to
 tell


Benal
 for
 all
 in
 the
 state,
 even
 illegal


aliens,
 doesn't
 that
 create
 a


responsibility
 on
 you
 to
 audit
 the


system
 and
 make
 sure
 it's
 not
 being


abused?
 When
 you
 then
 turn
 a
 blind
 eye


Yeah.


>> to
 the
 fraud
 and
 you
 refuse
 to
 even


acknowledge
 it,
 you
 just
 pretend
 like
 it


doesn't
 exist
 and
 you
 veto
 the
 audits.


That's
 doubly
 wrong.


>> But
 but
 it
 doesn't
 hurt
 California.
 This


is
 the
 the
 part
 of
 the
 story
 that's
 so


infuriating.
 You
 don't
 audit
 the
 books


in
 California
 because
 the
 federal


government's
 paying
 anyway.
 So
 why
 would


I
 audit
 the
 books
 to
 find
 out
 that
 my


people
 aren't
 getting
 free
 money
 from


the
 federal
 government?
 Let's
 talk
 about


illegal
 immigrants.
 So
 Gavin
 Newsome
 was


given
 us
 a
 hard
 time
 for
 threatening
 the


health
 insurance
 of
 illegal
 immigrants.


Just
 to
 be
 very
 transparent,
 if
 you're


on
 Medicare,
 you
 don't
 get
 free
 dental.


You
 don't
 get
 free
 vision.
 You
 do
 if


you're
 an
 illegal
 immigrant
 in


California.


>> This
 is
 the
 inferior.
 So
 anyway,
 so


you've
 got
 taxpayers
 in
 New
 Mexico,


right,
 which
 is
 a
 blue
 state
 but
 a
 poor


state,
 paying
 extra
 tax
 dollars
 to
 the


federal
 government
 that
 are
 recycled


back
 into
 LA
 to
 deal
 with
 the
 fraud
 that


I'm
 talking
 about.
 So
 illegal


immigrants,
 he's
 mad.
 He's
 mad.
 He's


mad.
 He's
 mad.
 We're
 horrible
 people.


We're
 Republicans.
 You
 have
 no


conscience.
 You
 have
 no
 heart.
 As
 soon


as
 we
 made
 it
 clear
 we
 were
 no
 longer


going
 to
 pay
 for
 illegal
 immigrants
 in


California,
 what
 did
 he
 do?
 He
 took
 them


off
 Medcal.
 Now,
 he
 didn't
 take
 them


off.
 He took
 them
 up
 on
 the
 federal


side.
 In
 theory,
 only
 emergency
 services


are
 going
 to
 get
 paid
 for
 for
 illegal


immigrants
 in
 California,
 which
 is
 a


national
 law


>> and
 is
 and
 is
 reasonable.


>> Reasonable.
 Now,
 I'm
 I'm
 all
 we
 want


babies
 delivered,
 car
 accident
 victims


hurt,
 get
 of
 course
 get
 healthcare,
 but


not
 elective
 hernia
 surgery,
 cataracts,


you
 know,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 an
 American


citizen
 who
 paid
 into
 the
 system
 to
 get


these.
 So,
 anyway,
 so
 we
 we
 deal
 with


this.
 Gavin
 says,
 "We're
 only
 going
 to


pay
 for
 illegal
 immigrants
 through
 our


own
 state-based
 system."
 We've
 audited


him.
 Now,
 this
 data
 is
 coming
 out
 this


week.
 We
 have
 now
 found
 over
 $1.5


billion
 dollar
 of
 money
 spent
 wrongly.


We've
 audited
 it.
 They're
 not
 even


arguing.
 $1.5
 billion
 dollars
 from
 uh


that
 California
 charged
 the
 federal


government
 for
 illegal
 immigrants
 that


they're
 not
 allowed
 to
 pay
 charge
 us


for.
 They
 have
 to
 pay
 for
 it
 themselves.


He's
 not
 happy.
 But
 they're
 paying
 us


because
 they
 know
 we're
 right.
 So,


you're
 going
 to
 see
 something
 happen


very
 interesting
 in
 California.
 As
 soon


as
 the
 money
 is
 being
 paid
 by
 California


government
 officials,
 they're
 going
 to


start
 getting
 more
 serious
 about
 this.


And
 that's
 why
 it's
 so
 important
 for
 us


to
 say,
 "We're
 not
 into
 this
 anymore.


I'm
 not
 going to
 let
 taxpayers
 in


Alabama
 and
 Mississippi,
 New
 Mexico,
 you


know,
 our
 poorest
 states
 pay
 for
 the


fourth
 largest
 economy
 in
 the
 world."


And
 they
 get
 less.


>> And
 they
 get
 less.
 And
 you
 know,
 the


immigr
 we're
 a
 country
 of
 immigrants.


You
 could
 absolutely
 believe
 in
 legal


immigration
 and
 want
 the
 border
 closed.


That's
 what
 we
 saw
 in
 the
 last
 election.


That
 was
 the
 deciding
 issue,
 I
 think,
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 I
 mean,
 they
 also


picked
 a
 terrible
 candidate
 on
 the
 other


side
 and
 didn't
 have
 a
 primary.
 Put
 that


aside.
 If
 you


>> We
 had
 an
 amazing
 candidate,
 too.


>> Incredibly
 tremendous.
 Okay.


>> The
 best
 ever.


>> They're
 the
 greatest
 ever.


>> I'm
 minimizing.


>> I'm
 just
 saying.
 I
 mean,
 you
 kind
 of


went
 up
 against
 a
 we
 Anyway,
 put
 it


aside.
 You
 know,
 the
 the
 thing
 that
 I


think
 is
 super
 important
 is
 incentives


matter.
 You
 you've
 said
 this
 many
 times


without
 explicitly
 saying
 it
 in
 our


conversation.
 The
 incentive
 for
 people


to
 come
 to
 America
 illegally
 is
 to
 make


a
 better
 life
 for
 themselves
 and
 to
 have


a
 job,
 employment,
 and
 these
 social


services.
 If
 the
 social
 services
 aren't


available,
 you
 know,
 some
 number
 are


going
 to
 stay
 back.
 And
 if
 the
 jobs


aren't
 available,
 then
 why
 would
 you


risk
 it?
 Why
 would
 you
 pay
 one
 of
 these


coyotes
 5
 $25,000
 across
 the
 board?
 You


wouldn't.
 You
 would
 get
 in
 the
 line
 to


do
 it
 properly.
 And
 that's
 a
 very
 simple


solution
 here.
 You
 you
 just
 change
 the


incentive.
 make
 it
 impossible
 for
 an


illegal
 alien
 to
 come
 here
 for
 those
 two


things.


>> Do
 you
 know
 what
 financial
 value
 there


is
 of
 having
 free
 healthcare
 in
 America?


>> So
 many
 will
 the


>> I'm
 not
 going to
 make
 you
 guess.


>> Well,
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 for
 the


employers
 I
 can
 say
 it's
 very
 acute
 to


insert
 yourself
 into
 the
 relationship


with
 your
 employees
 because
 employees


will
 not
 leave
 one
 company.
 They'll
 pick


the
 company
 they
 work
 for
 based
 on
 the


healthare
 and
 they
 will
 not
 leave
 a


company
 to
 pursue
 a
 better
 opportunity


in
 order
 to
 keep
 their
 healthare
 which


is
 dysfunctional
 because
 you
 want
 talent


to
 move.
 That's
 a
 uniquely
 Silicon


Valley
 entrepreneurial
 way
 to
 look
 at


it.


>> From
 the
 employer
 market,
 uh
 we
 we
 think


the
 money
 should
 follow
 the
 patient,
 but


broadly
 speaking,
 because
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 regulate
 commercial
 insurance.
 For


illegal
 immigrants,
 for
 your
 family,


it's
 worth
 about
 $30,000.
 So,
 there
 is


no
 good
 reason
 for
 you
 to
 go
 back
 home


again
 if
 we
 give
 you
 worldass
 healthcare


coverage.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 this
 is
 a
 major
 issue
 for
 us
 dealing


with
 the
 immigration
 problem
 because
 you


cannot
 send
 10
 million
 people
 back


legally
 who
 are
 here
 illegally.
 The


president
 has
 said
 this,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 he
 said
 it
 publicly,
 but
 I
 think


he
 would.
 It
 would
 take
 us
 200
 years
 of


legal
 machinations
 to
 send
 back
 people


who
 came
 here
 illegally.
 So,
 there
 is
 no


legal
 path
 to
 expelling
 people
 who
 came


here
 illegally.
 You
 have
 to
 remove
 the


incentives
 to
 stay
 here.
 Free
 housing,


free
 food,
 free
 healthcare.
 Of
 course,


you're
 going
 to
 stay.


>> Show
 me
 an
 incentive.
 I'll
 show
 you
 the


outcome.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 war
 on


drugs,
 um
 how
 unsuccessful
 it's
 been,
 uh


people
 go
 to
 San
 Francisco
 for
 a
 reason


for
 their
 fentinel
 because
 they
 can
 buy


it
 and
 there's
 no
 policing.
 And
 it
 is


exactly
 a
 function
 of
 more
 policing


means
 the
 price
 of
 those
 drugs
 go
 up,


which
 means
 consumption
 goes
 down.
 Not


only
 is
 there
 that
 dynamic
 missing
 in


San
 Francisco
 because
 there's
 no


enforcement
 and
 you
 can
 get
 fentinel


for5
 or
 $10
 a
 hit,
 they
 also
 give
 you


housing
 at
 $800
 or
 something
 to
 that


effect
 per
 month.
 So
 the
 homeless


industrial
 complex
 has
 now
 created
 an


incentive
 and
 everybody
 in
 that
 you
 know


really
 tragic
 junky
 community
 knows
 that


and
 they
 leave
 Texas
 they
 leave
 other


states
 to
 go
 there
 and
 then
 they
 bear


the
 brunt
 of
 it
 and
 they
 are
 actually


increasing
 the
 suffering.
 What's
 your


take
 on
 these
 new
 super
 drugs
 versus
 the


the
 rescheduling
 of
 drugs?
 Uh
 Obama


wanted
 to
 do
 it
 in
 his
 second
 term.
 He


didn't
 have
 the
 political
 willpower
 or


will
 to
 do
 it.
 And
 Trump
 now
 is
 saying,


"Hey,
 maybe
 for
 cannabis
 we
 should


rethink
 that
 and
 do
 what
 Canada's
 done


in
 other
 modern
 nations."
 How
 do
 you


look
 at
 those
 specific
 drugs?
 Fentinyl,


9
 or
 12
 overdoses
 a
 day
 in
 San
 Francisco


at
 the
 peak.
 Um,
 and
 then


methamphetamine,
 which
 is
 just
 another


>> We
 have
 good
 substance
 use
 disorder


medications.
 We
 can't
 get
 people
 into


the
 programs.
 Uh
 this
 is
 why


homelessness
 is
 an
 industrial
 complex


and
 the
 states
 that
 have
 done
 it
 well.
 I


mean
 I
 know
 Mayor
 Suarez
 in
 Miami


dropped
 the
 number
 by
 90%.
 And
 he
 did
 it


just
 by
 making
 sure
 that
 you
 got


arrested
 every
 time
 you
 peed
 publicly.


And
 they
 don't
 put
 you
 in
 in
 jail.
 They


put
 you
 in
 in
 rehab.
 But
 it
 takes
 four,


five,
 six
 efforts.
 You
 can't
 give
 people


free
 showers,
 great
 accommodations,
 lots


of
 food,
 and
 then
 expect
 them
 to
 stop


using
 drugs
 because
 you're
 enabling
 that


behavior
 and
 not
 expecting
 bad
 outcomes,


which
 is
 what
 happened.
 But
 I
 was
 in
 the


in
 Kensington,
 Philadelphia,
 which
 is


the
 drug
 capital
 of
 the
 East.
 And


>> oh,
 this
 is
 where
 they
 have
 that
 other


super
 drug.
 I
 forgot
 the
 name
 of
 it.


It's
 very
 pernicious.
 Tran.


>> Yeah.
 Tran
 is
 a
 terrible
 drug.
 It
 it


creates
 massive
 ulcers
 on
 your
 body.
 And


so
 I
 I
 was
 there
 and
 you
 know
 I
 I
 I
 I


just
 walked
 the
 streets
 just
 talk
 to


people
 like,
 "Why
 are
 you
 here?
 Where'd


you
 come
 from?
 Why
 don't
 you
 go
 home,


etc."
 And
 I
 I
 ran
 into
 a
 guy
 uh
 who
 had


just
 saved
 someone's
 life
 giving
 them


the
 lock
 zone
 as
 an
 inhaler.
 And
 he's
 an


ambulance
 driver.
 And
 I
 said,
 'Well,
 you


know
 what
 happened?
 He
 says,
 'Well,
 they


odied.
 I
 gave
 it
 to
 them.
 And
 I
 said,


'Well,
 what
 did
 they
 tell
 you?
 How
 do


they
 thank
 you
 when
 they
 awaken
 from


near
 death,
 from
 that
 dark
 abyss
 of


darkness?
 And
 he
 said,
 they're
 almost


always
 livid
 at
 me.


>> Yeah,
 you
 ruined
 their
 high.


>> Well,
 not
 and
 you
 ruined
 their
 their


escape.


>> Oh,
 they're
 they're
 actually
 hoping
 to


end
 this
 suffering.


>> The
 pain
 was
 so
 bad.
 That's
 why
 it
 seems


nice.
 And
 that's
 a
 that's
 why
 I
 was


telling
 my
 friends
 in
 Minnesota,


Minnesota
 nice
 is
 great
 when
 you
 really


really
 mean
 it.
 But
 nice
 does
 not
 mean


allowing
 your
 public
 health
 system
 to
 be


raped.
 It's
 not
 allowing
 people
 to
 abuse


themselves
 expecting
 a
 different
 outcome


than
 what
 historically
 has
 happened.
 You


need
 to
 if
 you
 really
 love
 people,
 you


might
 not
 like
 them,
 but
 if
 you
 really


love
 them,
 you'll
 do
 something
 that


actually
 goes
 beyond
 like
 that
 makes
 you


ultimately
 gain
 respect
 for
 them
 for
 you


and
 you.
 There's
 a
 very
 simple
 tough
 and


if
 you
 were
 to
 take
 a
 Christian
 view
 of


it
 um
 and
 you
 were
 to
 talk
 to
 any
 of
 the


parents,
 these
 poor
 parents
 who
 are


suffering
 with
 a
 child
 addicted
 to
 drugs


and
 their
 adult
 child
 is
 on
 the
 street


and
 you
 said
 to
 them,
 "We
 can
 arrest


them
 and
 put
 them
 in
 jail.
 Uh
 we
 can


treat
 them
 incredibly
 severely
 and
 try


to,
 you
 know,
 just
 lock
 them
 up
 until


they
 they
 say,
 "Thank
 you.
 Please
 do


that."
 But
 there
 are
 a
 bunch
 of
 lunatics


who
 think
 you're
 harassing
 a
 homeless


person
 who
 had
 a
 bad
 beat
 and
 you're


infringing
 on
 their
 freedom.
 But
 the


parents
 and
 the
 family
 would
 say,


"Please
 lock
 them
 up.
 That's
 our
 last


stitch
 effort."
 So
 it's
 not
 compassion.


It
 is
 not
 Christian
 at
 all.


>> I
 That's
 a
 faculty
 lounge
 discussion


with
 your
 tweed
 jacket
 on.
 Yeah.


>> And
 your
 elbow
 protectors
 when
 you're


pontificating
 about
 people
 that
 you
 read


about,
 right?


>> Uh
 and
 I
 point
 that
 out
 because
 I'm
 on


the
 facult,
 you
 know,
 I'
 I've
 been


>> You
 got
 one
 of
 those
 tweet
 you
 you


talked
 to
 those
 tweet.


>> Yeah.
 I
 got
 rid
 of
 my
 tweet
 jackets.


>> The
 elbow
 patches,
 they
 look
 terrible


anyway.


>> But
 you
 know,
 you
 sit
 there
 and
 you
 act


and
 this
 is
 the
 the
 crazy
 thing
 about


intelligence
 is
 people.
 The
 more


intelligent
 you
 are,
 the
 better
 you
 are


to
 lying
 to
 yourself
 and
 to
 others


around
 you
 because
 you
 can
 construe


almost
 any
 data
 into
 something
 that
 has,


you
 know,
 a
 meaning
 that's
 not
 really


there.
 And
 we
 have
 tolerated
 that
 for


too
 long.
 I
 I
 actually
 think
 that's
 an


important
 part
 of
 President
 Trump's


appeal.
 He
 cuts
 through
 all
 that
 BS.


Don't
 tell
 me
 stuff
 that
 just
 defies


common
 sense
 because
 common
 sense
 is
 not


so
 common.
 I
 think


>> you
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 accept
 it.
 I
 think


that's
 the
 other
 thing
 that
 I
 think


Trump
 has
 has
 I
 think
 taught
 some
 folks.


We
 do
 not
 have
 to
 accept
 that
 state
 of


affairs.
 You
 don't
 have
 to
 accept
 and


the
 framing
 of
 it.
 Let's
 just
 call
 it


what
 it
 is.
 You
 know,
 I've
 used
 the
 term


here
 on
 our
 podcast
 and
 say
 junkies


because
 I
 grew
 up
 in
 New
 York
 in
 the
 70s


and
 ' 80s
 and
 that's
 what
 we
 call
 people


who
 are
 addicted
 to
 smack,
 junkies.
 It's


not
 derogatory.
 It's
 an
 indication
 of


just
 how
 bad
 that
 disease
 is.
 Calling
 it


homelessness


means
 you're
 trying
 to
 solve
 the
 wrong


thing.
 Putting
 a
 junkie
 in
 a
 home.
 They


have
 plenty
 of
 homes
 to
 go
 to.
 It's


nothing
 to
 do
 with
 that.


>> All right.
 Well,
 look,


>> we
 got
 to
 let
 Doc
 This
 How
 long
 have
 we


talking?
 Two
 hours.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 But
 I
 got
 Dr.
 Surgeon
 with


tips.


>> All right.
 Let
 me
 Dr.
 House.


>> Yeah.
 Let
 me
 me
 can
 I


>> please?


>> All
 right.
 So,
 I
 just
 want
 Yeah,
 let
 me


just
 wrap
 this
 up.
 So,
 uh
 Dr.
 Oz
 first


reached
 out
 to
 me
 during
 the
 transition


because
 he's
 so
 intensely
 interested
 in


AI
 and
 he


>> This
 is
 when
 you
 were
 transitioning.


>> Yes.
 During
 my


>> transition,
 you
 supported
 him.


>> I
 loved
 I
 love
 David.
 Yes,
 we
 all
 did.


>> And
 uh
 he
 was
 looking
 for
 for
 uh
 names


of
 AI
 experts
 in
 Silicon
 Valley
 to
 build


his
 advisory
 panel
 and
 just
 impressed
 me


right
 away
 with
 the
 the
 energy
 that
 you


bring,
 the
 knowledge,
 the
 passion.
 You


really
 do
 care
 about
 improving
 health


outcomes
 for
 all
 Americans
 and
 I
 think


we
 are
 very
 lucky
 to
 have
 you
 in
 this


administration.
 uh
 from
 the
 president
 on


down
 and
 I
 think
 the
 country
 is
 very


lucky
 to
 have
 you
 could
 be
 doing
 many


many
 different
 things
 but
 you
 really


care
 about
 this
 job
 and
 I
 think
 it's


really
 incredible
 what
 you're
 doing.


Thank
 you
 for
 your
 service.


>> I
 wanted
 to
 have
 you
 speak
 to
 us
 on
 the


pods.
 Kind
 of
 long
 overdue.


>> Well,
 you're
 very
 kind
 to
 have
 me
 on.


I've
 enjoyed
 it.
 Big
 fan
 obviously
 of


your
 work
 in
 part
 because
 you
 brought
 a


sense
 of
 clarity
 to
 many
 of the
 issues


you
 discussed
 and
 I
 want
 to
 thank
 you


David
 for
 being
 a
 you
 first
 of
 all
 using


your
 ability
 to
 get
 people
 together.
 the


power
 to
 convene
 is
 remarkably


effective,
 but
 you've
 also
 demystified
 a


lot
 of
 this
 and
 allowed
 the


administration
 to
 embrace
 AI
 and


technology
 in
 general.
 So,
 God
 bless


you.


>> Great.
 Thank
 you.
 Thanks
 for
 being
 here.


>> We'll
 see
 you
 next
 time
 on
 Allin
 at


Davos.
 I'm
 going
 all
 in.


I'm
 going
 all
 in.
