 How
 many
 Jackson
 Holes
 have


you
 actually
 been
 to
 now?


>> Uh,
 it's
 a
 little
 hard
 to
 say,
 but
 my


first
 one
 was
 1997.


>> I've
 missed
 a
 few
 here
 and
 there
 as


breaking
 news
 has
 happened
 and
 I've
 had


to
 be
 somewhere
 else,
 but
 so
 somewhere


around
 25
 to
 30.


>> So
 Joe,
 if
 we
 keep
 doing
 this
 for


another
 40
 years,
 we'll
 uh
 we'll
 notch


up
 as
 many
 Jackson
 holes
 as
 Mike
 has


been
 to.
 Maybe


>> not.
 But
 if
 he
 does
 it
 another
 40
 or
 so,


we
 can
 never
 catch
 up.


>> If
 Mike
 stops
 now
 and
 we
 keep
 doing
 it


until
 we're
 80,


>> maybe
 we'll
 catch
 up.


>> I
 did
 a
 dead
 last.


>> I
 am
 both
 the
 most
 popular
 trader
 and


most
 successful
 trader
 at
 Citadel.


>> Feta's
 going
 viral.


>> Uh,
 barges.


>> This
 is
 an
 after
 school
 special
 except


>> I've
 decided
 I'm
 going
 to
 base
 my
 entire


personality
 going
 forward
 on
 campaigning


for
 a
 strategic
 pork
 reserve
 in
 the
 US.


>> Black
 gold.


>> These
 are
 the
 the
 important
 questions.


Is
 it
 robots
 taking
 over
 the
 world?


>> No,
 I
 think
 that
 like
 in
 a
 couple
 years


the
 AI
 will
 do
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of


making
 the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 One
 day
 that


person
 will
 have
 the
 mandate
 of
 heaven.


>> How
 do
 I
 get
 more
 popular
 and


successful?


>> We
 do
 have


>> the
 perfect
 guest.


>> Welcome
 to
 Lots
 More,
 where
 we
 catch
 up


with
 friends
 about
 what's
 going
 on
 right


now.


>> Because
 even
 when
 OddLots
 is
 over,


there's
 always
 lots
 more.


>> And
 we
 really
 do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.


We
 are
 of
 course
 talking
 to
 the
 one
 and


only
 Mike
 McKe
 of
 Bloomberg
 TV.
 A
 little


surprising
 speech
 today,
 huh?


>> Yeah,
 I
 was
 wrong.
 As
 were
 the
 majority


of
 analysts
 who
 thought
 that
 J.
 Paul


would
 want
 to
 leave
 his
 options
 open
 for


September
 because
 as
 we've
 been


repeating
 over
 and
 over
 again,
 there's


another
 jobs
 report,
 there's
 another
 CPI


report
 before
 the
 next
 meeting.


>> And
 so
 what
 happens
 if
 we
 see
 a


reversion
 to
 the
 mean?
 We
 had
 a
 weak


jobs
 report.
 What
 if
 the
 next
 one
 comes


in
 strong?
 Uh
 we
 had
 inflation


>> going
 through
 CPI
 at
 a
 low
 level.
 Does


that
 pick
 up
 a
 lot?
 In
 which
 case
 you


don't
 want
 to
 cut
 rates.
 So
 it
 was
 a
 bit


of
 a
 surprise
 that
 he
 said
 basically


opened
 the
 door
 to
 a
 rate
 cut
 because


now
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 close
 that
 door.


Tracy,
 have
 you
 read
 Anna
 Wong's
 take


yet?


>> I
 have
 not.
 So,
 she
 has
 a
 new
 piece
 out


on
 the
 terminal
 which
 you
 you
 should


read,
 but
 she
 argues
 that's
 not
 so


dovish
 if
 you
 use
 the
 2024
 speech
 as
 the


benchmark,
 which
 is
 true
 for
 sure.
 That


was
 a
 more
 dovish
 speech.
 But
 what
 I


think
 the
 vibe
 is
 that
 maybe
 the
 three


of
 us
 have,
 it's
 certainly
 dovish
 in
 the


context
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 suddenly


like,
 let's
 look
 at
 the
 inflation
 side


again.


>> Well,
 this
 is
 exactly
 it.
 So
 Mike,
 I


think
 you
 had
 the
 same
 experience
 as
 us,


which
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 from
 the


Fed
 that
 you've
 been
 talking
 to
 over
 the


past
 couple
 of
 days.
 They
 sounded
 more


hawkish
 than
 they
 did,
 you
 know,
 perhaps


like
 just
 three
 or
 four
 weeks
 ago.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 I
 have
 to
 think
 that
 or
 I


have
 to
 caution
 myself
 to
 look
 at
 this


as
 perhaps,
 as
 a
 statistician
 would
 say,


a
 selection
 error


>> because
 we
 happened
 to
 hit
 people
 who


were
 more
 hawkish.
 Obviously,
 the


chairman
 basically
 validated
 Chris


Waller's
 forecast
 that
 uh
 infl
 they've


decided
 that
 inflation
 is
 going
 to
 go


up,
 but
 it's
 going to
 go
 up
 slowly.


It'll
 take
 a
 while
 to
 get
 into
 the


economy
 and
 sector
 by
 sector,
 it'll
 be
 a


one-time
 price
 rise
 and
 not
 a
 continuing


price
 increase.
 Setting
 aside
 the
 actual


technical
 economic
 details
 of
 the
 speech


itself,
 were
 you
 surprised
 that
 there


wasn't
 something
 more,
 I
 don't
 know,


validary
 is
 the
 word,
 but
 you
 know,
 it's


his
 last
 speech
 as
 the
 chairman.
 It


comes
 at
 a
 time
 when
 we
 all
 were
 all


talking
 about
 the
 sort
 of
 threats
 to


Federal
 Reserve
 independence.
 Were
 you


surprised
 it
 was
 such
 a
 policy
 speech


and
 not
 any
 sort
 of
 nods
 to
 some
 of


these
 bigger
 things?


>> I
 was
 not
 surprised
 by
 that.
 Paul
 is


very
 self-fulfacing.
 He's
 not
 somebody


who
 likes
 to
 toot
 his
 own
 horn.
 And
 I
 we


kind
 of
 knew
 going
 in
 that
 he
 didn't


want
 to
 make
 a
 big
 deal
 of
 this
 being


his
 last
 Jackson
 Hole
 as
 chair.


>> The
 Fed
 independence
 thing
 was
 a
 bit
 of


a
 surprise
 because
 it
 has
 been
 such
 a
 a


big
 issue.
 But
 I
 think
 given
 the
 message


he
 wanted
 to
 send
 to
 the
 markets
 about


the
 policy
 going
 forward,
 plus
 he
 had


the
 whole
 section
 on
 the
 new
 framework


he
 had
 to
 discuss.
 Yeah.
 I
 think
 they


felt
 it
 was
 just
 going
 to
 be
 too
 long,


too
 much
 and
 that
 would
 come
 up
 in
 many


other
 uh
 fora
 to
 talk
 about.


>> It
 is
 funny,
 no
 one's
 talking
 about
 the


framework.
 The
 results
 of
 like
 five


years
 of
 work
 on
 the
 framework
 are


published
 today
 and
 they're
 just
 lost
 in


all


>> I
 have
 asked
 uh
 Fed
 officials
 about


this.
 I
 said,
 why
 do
 you
 do
 this?


Because
 they
 came
 up
 with
 this
 new


framework
 in
 2020
 that
 didn't
 work.
 And


a
 year
 into
 it,
 JP
 Pal
 said,
 "Well,


we've
 junk
 the
 framework
 because
 we've


got
 inflation."
 And
 so,
 if
 you're
 gonna


go
 to
 all
 this
 work
 to
 create
 a


framework
 and
 then
 as
 soon
 as
 the


economy
 turns,
 you
 junk
 it.
 Kind
 of


what's
 the
 point?


>> And
 their
 argument
 is
 that
 it
 gives
 them


sort
 of
 a
 reference
 point
 of
 how
 they


want
 to
 think
 about
 things.
 And
 today


really,
 they
 went
 back
 to
 2012,
 which


was


>> we'll
 do
 whatever
 the
 economy
 needs
 when


it
 needs
 it.
 It's
 important
 to
 remember


it's
 interesting
 thinking
 about
 that


2020
 framework
 because
 we
 are
 so
 the


existence
 of
 that
 framework
 is
 so
 2010s


right
 it's
 so
 like
 thinking
 about
 well


the
 main
 problem
 of
 monetary
 policy
 is


long
 periods
 of
 undershoots


>> the
 zero
 bound


>> the
 zero
 bound
 constantly
 under
 2%
 how


are
 we
 going
 to
 credibly
 get
 it
 above


and
 then
 five
 minutes
 later
 we
 have
 the


worst
 inflation
 yeah
 in
 40
 years
 that


was
 a
 real
 that
 framework
 from
 2020
 was


is
 an
 artifact
 of
 a
 time.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 And
 the
 Fed's
 new


framework
 sort
 of
 takes
 into
 account
 the


fact
 that
 that
 could
 happen
 again


because
 they're
 not
 using
 shortfall


anymore
 in
 in
 employment.
 Uh
 but
 and


they're
 they've
 also
 dropped
 references


to
 the
 zero
 lower
 bound,
 but
 they


basically
 they're
 saying
 we
 admit
 that


we
 can't
 steer
 the
 economy
 in
 quite
 as


precise
 a
 way
 as
 we
 thought
 we
 could


because
 the
 underlying
 conditions
 that


we're
 working
 off
 of
 can
 change
 faster


than
 we
 anticipated.
 I
 will
 just
 note
 I


know
 that
 pal
 didn't
 speak
 about
 central


bank
 independence
 directly
 but
 there
 is


at
 least
 one
 paper
 being
 presented
 at


the
 conference
 that
 does
 deal
 with
 this


issue
 by
 Emmy
 Nakamura
 from
 Berkeley
 and


we
 have
 a
 really
 good
 episode
 coming
 up


with
 her.
 So
 there
 there
 is
 some


thematic
 discussion.
 It's
 just
 we're
 not


all
 hearing
 it
 because
 it's
 closed


doors.
 Although
 Mike,
 you
 get
 to
 go


inside
 the
 conference.
 I
 get
 to
 go


inside.


>> All
 right.
 So
 what's
 the
 vibe
 like
 in
 in


the
 room?
 Well,
 I
 hate
 to
 disappoint


everybody,
 but
 it's
 rather
 quite
 boring


unless
 unless
 you're
 an
 academic


economist
 because
 these
 papers
 are


written
 by
 academic
 economists
 and


they're
 designed
 to
 look
 at
 longer
 term


issues
 and
 try
 to
 put
 them
 into
 context


so
 that
 the
 central
 bankers
 can
 think


about
 them.
 Okay,
 here's
 a
 problem


that's
 come
 up.
 What's
 the
 research
 said


about
 it
 in
 the
 past?
 That
 sort
 of


thing.
 It's
 not
 a
 meeting
 where
 people


come
 in
 and
 go,
 "Okay,
 here's


unemployment
 and
 here's
 prices
 and
 what


do
 we
 do
 at
 the
 next
 meeting?"
 That
 that


doesn't
 get
 discussed
 at
 all.
 Even
 the


open
 market
 committee
 officials
 who
 are


here,
 they're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 really


talking
 about
 that
 because
 uh
 they
 talk


about
 that
 all
 the
 time.
 They're
 here
 to


fish
 and
 and
 hike
 and
 enjoy
 the
 scenery


along
 with
 these
 academic
 papers.
 So


inside
 it's
 an
 academic
 uh
 conference.


They
 present
 the
 papers.
 They
 have
 a


discussant
 who
 talks
 about
 the
 papers


and
 then
 people
 can
 ask
 questions.
 And


if
 you
 notice,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're


watching
 your
 Bloomberg
 terminal,
 it's


almost
 never
 a
 headline
 from
 inside


because
 nobody
 says
 anything
 that
 would


move
 markets
 or
 interest
 people
 really.


You
 know,
 other
 regional
 feds
 have
 their


conferences.
 So,
 you
 know,
 there's


there's
 a
 Boston
 Fed
 one
 in
 November.


There's
 an
 Atlanta
 Fed
 one.
 I
 think
 it's


somewhere
 in
 Florida
 at
 some
 point
 in


the
 year.
 The
 only
 thing
 that's
 really


special
 here
 is
 that,
 and
 Powell
 alluded


to
 it,
 it's
 Jackson
 Hole
 in
 August.
 and


anyone
 would
 be
 a
 fool
 to
 say
 no
 to


coming
 there
 and
 that's
 how
 they
 got


Vulkar
 to
 come
 because
 he
 liked
 fly


fishing
 like
 this
 in
 theory
 like
 they


could
 all
 show
 up
 at
 the
 other
 ones
 but


it's
 Jackson
 Hole
 in
 August
 going
 to
 say


and
 and
 and
 as
 you
 mentioned
 people
 are


here
 to
 fly
 fish
 I
 think
 that's
 actually


an
 important
 element
 even
 though
 it's


just
 a
 fun
 element
 which
 is
 that


>> it's
 late
 summer
 it's
 kind
 of
 like


halfway
 between
 vacation
 and
 work
 out


here
 for
 almost
 everyone
 another
 reason


that
 it
 has
 become
 important
 though
 is


starting
 with
 Ben
 Bernani
 during
 the


great
 financial
 crisis
 he
 came
 and
 the


chairman
 usually
 gave
 a
 speech
 to
 open


the
 conference
 on
 the
 conference
 topic


>> and
 it
 was
 like,
 okay,
 we're
 talking


about
 long-term
 labor
 issues.
 That's
 a


really
 good
 thing
 to
 talk
 about
 and


we're
 glad
 you're
 all
 here
 kind
 of


thing.
 Then
 he
 announced
 basically
 that


they
 were
 going
 to
 do
 QE
 for
 the
 first


time
 at
 this
 meeting.
 And
 then
 the
 next


year
 he
 also
 had
 announcement
 about
 uh


QEQT
 and
 what
 they
 were
 going
 to
 do.
 And


then
 all
 of a
 sudden
 the
 focus
 became


what's
 the
 chairman
 going
 to
 say?


Because


>> if
 there's
 rarely
 a
 Fed
 meeting
 in


August,
 just
 the
 way
 the
 calendar
 falls,


maybe
 at
 the
 very
 beginning,
 and
 then


there
 isn't
 one
 till
 September.
 So
 you


have
 this
 long
 month
 where
 there's
 no


reference
 point
 for
 the
 markets
 and
 that


this
 became
 the
 reference
 point.
 So


everybody
 pays
 attention
 to
 it
 and
 as


you
 know,
 it's
 a
 big
 buildup
 to
 it.
 Oh,


we've
 got
 Jackson
 Hole
 next
 week.
 What's


the
 chairman
 going
 to
 say?
 And
 so
 that's


really
 focused
 a
 lot
 of
 attention
 on
 it,


which
 then
 feeds
 on
 itself
 because
 it


becomes
 important.
 So
 people
 want
 to
 be


there
 because
 it
 is
 important.


>> This
 reminds
 me,
 there
 was
 an
 old
 study.


It
 was
 done
 a
 few
 years
 ago,
 so
 I
 would


love
 to
 see
 a
 new
 study,
 but
 it


basically
 looked
 at
 all
 the
 FOMC


statements
 and
 speeches
 over
 time.
 And


starting
 from
 2009,
 they
 exploded
 in


both
 length
 and
 complexity.
 So
 I
 think


it
 used
 to
 be
 you
 could
 have
 like,
 you


know,
 a
 high
 school
 reading
 level
 and
 be


fine
 reading
 some
 of
 the
 FOMC


statements.
 They
 were
 very
 short,
 like


400
 words.
 and
 then
 they
 became
 like


2,000
 words
 and
 you
 needed
 a
 college


degree
 at
 a
 minimum
 to
 fully
 understand


them.
 Talk
 to
 us
 about
 just
 like
 the


format
 of
 the
 speech
 cuz
 this
 is


something
 else
 that
 people
 like
 to
 do
 is


dissect
 like
 the
 number
 of
 words
 and


things
 like
 that.
 And
 it
 is
 true
 this
 is


a
 longer
 speech
 this
 year
 versus
 the


relatively
 short
 speech
 from
 last
 year


where
 Pal
 very
 definitively
 opened
 the


door
 to
 a
 cut.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 well
 I
 think
 that
 what
 made


this
 speech
 long
 was
 talking
 about
 the


framework.
 It's
 as
 we
 said
 maybe


somewhat
 irrelevant
 but
 he
 had
 to
 go


through
 it.
 They'd
 been
 doing
 this


exercise
 and
 it
 was
 anticipated
 he
 would


announce
 it
 here.
 So
 basically
 he
 went


through
 it.
 We've
 now
 done
 the
 exercise


and
 now
 we've
 explained
 it
 to
 you
 and
 so


you'll
 understand
 going
 forward
 if
 we


refer
 to
 this.
 So
 that
 made
 it
 longer.


The
 part
 that
 uh
 was
 really
 kind
 of
 to


the
 point
 was
 the
 stuff
 about
 the


economy.
 He
 outlined
 what
 they
 were


thinking
 about
 uh
 the
 labor
 market
 and


what
 they
 were
 thinking
 about
 inflation


and
 then
 how
 those
 two
 knit
 together.
 If


this
 had
 been
 an
 ordinary
 speech
 without


the
 framework,
 it
 wouldn't
 have
 been
 as


long.
 Maybe
 it
 would
 have
 come
 across
 as


even
 more
 punchy
 because
 it
 was
 just
 on


that
 subject.
 you
 you
 were
 talking
 about


the
 Fed's
 statements
 getting
 very
 long


uh
 in
 the
 post
 great
 financial
 crisis


years
 and
 the
 Fed
 realized
 that
 at
 one


point
 and
 so
 about
 two
 or
 three
 years


ago
 they've
 cut
 them
 back
 significantly.


We
 used
 to
 have
 very
 long
 statements


where
 they
 tried
 to
 explain
 every
 little


thing
 and
 people
 found
 that
 too
 much.
 So


now
 they're
 just
 kind
 of
 saying
 here's


we
 got
 one
 paragraph
 on
 where
 the


economy
 is
 and
 a
 paragraph
 that
 says


here's
 what
 we're
 doing
 about
 it.


>> You
 know
 another
 nice
 thing
 about


Jackson
 Hole
 in
 late
 August
 is
 you
 don't


just
 get
 you
 don't
 just
 lure
 the
 Fed


share
 there.
 you
 lure
 central
 bankers


all
 around
 the
 world.
 But
 I
 feel
 like
 in


this
 moment
 the
 the
 Fed
 itself,
 the
 Fed


is
 always
 first
 among
 equals.
 Most


people
 would
 agree
 with
 that,
 but
 the


Fed
 because
 of
 all
 the
 dramas
 like
 this


black
 hole
 sucking
 up
 all
 the
 energy.


It's
 your
 perception,
 you
 know,
 we
 saw


the
 walk
 where
 Powell
 was
 with
 Lagarde


and
 Bailey
 and
 Ua
 is
 your
 perception


that
 all
 the
 developed
 market
 central


banks
 are
 roughly
 wrestling
 with
 still


the
 same
 things
 because
 there's
 just


been
 there's
 been
 this
 global
 factor
 of


the
 inflation
 and
 so
 forth.
 Are
 they
 all


sort
 of
 basically
 feeling
 the
 same


stresses?


>> They
 are.
 We're
 still
 living
 in
 a


post-pandemic
 world.
 So
 data
 are


somewhat
 difficult
 to
 read
 and
 you
 see


the
 ups
 and
 downs
 of
 the
 economies
 that


you
 may
 or
 may
 not
 be
 able
 to
 track.
 But


the
 biggest
 thing
 at
 the
 moment
 is
 that


they're
 all
 wrestling
 with
 Trump
 fiscal


policy.
 But
 the
 fiscal
 policy
 has


different
 impacts
 on
 different


countries.
 For
 the
 United
 States,
 it's


inflationary.
 For
 many
 of
 the
 countries


out
 there,
 it's
 deflationary
 because


their
 currency
 is
 going
 down.
 The
 dollar


is
 getting
 stronger.
 And
 so
 they
 have


different
 problems
 they
 have
 to
 deal


with.
 They
 all
 have
 a
 problem
 with
 the


consequences
 of
 the
 Trump
 policy,
 but


the
 consequences
 are
 different
 for
 each


one.


>> Well,
 you
 were
 talking
 about
 this
 on
 TV


earlier
 because
 when
 it
 comes
 to


tariffs,
 there
 is
 still
 a
 huge
 debate


over
 how
 inflationary
 they
 might


actually
 be
 because
 in
 traditional


economics,
 you
 would
 view
 them
 as
 a
 tax


which
 tends
 to
 destroy
 demand
 and
 can


lead
 to
 deflation.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,
 we


have
 seen
 producer
 prices
 start
 to
 pick


up.
 What
 have
 you
 learned
 about
 just
 how


policymakers
 are
 actually
 viewing
 the


impact
 of
 tariffs
 at
 this
 conference?


>> Well,
 there
 has
 been
 division.
 We
 have


the
 Chris
 Waller
 version
 who
 went
 to
 the


textbook
 and
 said
 tariffs
 are
 a
 one-time


increase
 in
 the
 price
 level
 and
 then


since
 he
 first
 said
 that
 in
 July,
 what


we've
 seen
 is
 the
 president
 delaying


these
 tariffs.
 So,
 they
 come
 on
 one
 by


one
 and
 that
 drags
 the
 process
 out.
 Now,


what
 the
 chairman
 seemed
 to
 decide
 was


that
 it's
 still
 going
 to
 be
 a
 one-time


increase
 sector
 by
 sector.
 So,
 it
 might


drag
 out,
 but
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 an


ongoing
 process
 of
 each
 sector
 seeing


prices
 rise.
 So,
 the
 impacts
 they
 they


have
 a
 hard
 time
 judging
 because
 it's


not
 like
 you
 pass
 uh
 Smoot
 Holly
 and
 on


a
 certain
 day
 it
 takes
 effect
 and
 you


see
 the
 immediate
 price
 impact
 and
 then


you
 can
 measure
 what's
 happening
 and


what's
 it's
 going
 to
 do.
 Here
 they
 have


to
 take
 into
 account
 each
 sector,


whether
 the
 the
 exporter
 absorbs
 any
 of


it,
 whether
 the
 importer
 absorbs
 any
 of


it,
 what
 companies
 do
 in
 terms
 of


pricing.
 Do
 they
 take
 some
 out
 of
 their


margins
 because
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 lose


market
 share
 or
 do
 they
 just
 pass
 it


along
 to
 people?
 These
 are
 all
 complex


questions
 and
 and
 as
 one
 of
 the
 Fed


economist
 said
 to
 me,
 each
 one
 affects


another.


>> So
 because
 so
 much
 of
 this
 stuff
 is


intermediate
 goods
 that
 are
 used
 to


price
 something
 else.
 So
 it
 gets
 very


complicated.
 So,
 it
 is
 hard
 for
 them
 to


know
 exactly
 how
 this
 is
 going
 to
 play


out.


>> Tracy,
 I
 have
 a
 take.


>> Oh.
 Oh,
 do
 you?
 What
 a
 surprise.
 All


right,
 go
 ahead.
 I
 was
 thinking
 about


this
 when
 we
 were
 on
 air
 is
 maybe
 the


answer
 is
 that
 tariffs
 are
 a
 one-off


>> in
 terms
 of
 the
 inflationary
 impulse
 but


that
 the
 underlying
 political
 impulse
 to


impose
 tariffs
 this
 desire
 for
 everyone


to
 have
 all
 their
 stuff
 and
 protect


their
 home
 uh
 countries
 industries
 and


so
 forth
 is
 going
 to
 be
 this
 new


permanent
 feature
 that
 is
 not
 a
 one-off.


>> Would
 that
 feature
 be
 inflationary?


>> And
 if
 that
 is
 sustained
 then
 maybe
 it


is.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean
 there
 is
 an
 irony
 here


which
 is
 uh
 the
 Trump
 administration
 has


long
 criticized
 paperwork
 and
 government


bureaucracy
 and
 things
 like
 that
 and
 I


cannot
 even
 imagine
 how
 much
 time


companies
 are
 spending
 trying
 to
 figure


out
 tariffs
 right
 now
 and
 doing
 customs


documentation
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.


>> Okay,
 Mike,
 next
 year
 we're
 going
 to


have
 a
 new
 Fed
 chair,
 new
 vibes
 at


Jackson
 Hole
 potentially.
 Who
 are
 you


watching
 out
 for


>> right
 now?
 I'm
 still
 watching
 out
 for


the
 original
 Trump
 list,
 the
 Kevin's


Hasset
 and
 Worsh
 and
 for
 Chris
 Waller.


You
 could
 argue
 that
 the
 speech
 today


improved
 Waller's
 chances
 if
 if
 you
 were


looking
 at
 it
 from
 a
 Las
 Vegas
 point
 of


view
 in
 terms
 of
 odds
 because
 he
 was


right,


>> right?
 Sort
 of.


>> At least
 at
 least
 the
 Fed
 is
 saying
 he


was
 right.
 But
 this
 is
 Donald
 Trump.
 So,


we
 have
 no
 idea.
 I
 think
 most
 of
 the


people
 who've
 been
 sort
 of
 added
 on
 in


the
 talking
 about
 stage
 in
 terms
 of
 the


list
 are
 more
 red
 herrings.
 Some
 of
 them


are
 obviously
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 chair,


but
 what
 he's
 been
 able
 to
 do
 is
 get


more
 people
 on
 TV


getting
 interviewed
 about,
 are
 you
 going


to
 be
 the
 chair?
 And
 they're
 all
 saying,


well,
 we
 need
 to
 cut
 rates.
 You're
 not


on
 the
 list
 if
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 cut


rates.
 So,
 are
 they
 really
 serious


candidates?
 And
 Scott
 Besson
 says,


"Okay,
 I
 got
 11
 people
 I'm
 going
 to


bring
 in."
 The
 president
 keeps
 saying,


"I
 got
 three
 people
 I'm
 going
 to
 choose


from."
 So,
 I
 think
 you
 go
 back
 to
 the


original
 list.
 He's
 comfortable
 with


those
 people.
 They
 all
 look
 like
 they


could
 be
 fed
 chairs
 and
 we
 know
 the
 the


impression
 that
 the
 person
 makes
 is


important.
 So
 they're
 they're
 the
 most


likely
 ones
 to
 choose
 from.
 I'm
 not


saying
 he
 couldn't
 surprise.
 He


surprises
 in
 almost
 everything
 he
 does.


>> Have
 you
 interacted
 with
 Waller
 before?


I've
 never
 met
 him.
 So


>> Oh,
 I
 know
 Chris
 quite
 well.
 The
 one


thing
 about
 Chris
 is
 we've
 we've


extrapolated
 the
 Lisa
 Cook
 thing
 to
 if


the
 president
 got
 four
 people
 on
 the


board,
 then
 they
 can
 fire
 all
 the
 bank


presidents,
 etc.,
 etc.,
 and
 he'd
 have


all
 this
 control.
 I
 don't
 think
 Waller


would
 go
 along
 with
 that.
 He's
 in
 favor


of
 lower
 interest
 rates.
 Uh
 he
 has
 his


own
 ideas
 about
 the
 economy,
 but
 he's
 a


very
 smart
 economist
 and
 uh
 and
 you


could
 defend
 what
 he
 says
 even
 if
 you


don't
 necessarily
 agree
 with
 it.
 But


he's
 an
 institutionalist.
 He's
 somebody


who
 follows
 what
 the
 Fed
 has
 done
 in
 the


past.
 And
 I
 don't
 think
 he
 would
 give
 in


to
 the
 president's
 desire
 to
 do


something
 that
 would
 hurt
 the
 Fed,
 hurt


its
 credibility,
 hurt
 its
 ability
 to
 do


its
 job.


>> Tracy,
 it's
 2025.
 I
 think
 David
 Zervos


looks
 like
 a
 Fed
 chair.


>> Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 fly
 fishing.
 I'm


going to
 do
 what
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 do
 at


Jackson
 Hole
 and
 go
 fish.


>> Let's
 go.
