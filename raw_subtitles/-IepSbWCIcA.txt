- I am a Zen practitioner
and I'm an ordained Zen
priest, and I'm a Zen teacher.
I'm actually a Roshi, a Zen master.
And so I meditate every day.
I teach meditation here
in the United States
and actually internationally,
it's a big part of my life.
And what I find is that it is
an enormous benefit in terms of
how I think about my own
life, other people's lives,
how I think about my research,
how I think about working with patients.
- [Narrator] Everyday Zen,
mindfulness, impermanence and compassion.
- Zen emphasizes community.
It's called sangha in
the Buddhist language.
And it's really the idea
that we practice learning about ourselves
and each other by being in
relationships with each other,
both during meditation sessions
and out there in the world.
So we practice with
whatever comes up for us.
So if I get annoyed at my
friend, I practice with that.
I notice the annoyance, I feel
what it feels like in my body
and in my brain, and I notice
what I do with annoyance.
And then I notice how my friend reacts
to me when I'm annoyed.
All these things are part of this
kind of deep dive into
what is my experience like
of being in a relationship?
What's joy like in a relationship?
One of the principles of meditation is
that if we really look at our own lives,
our minds are messy and chaotic,
and we're not always proud of
what we feel or what we think.
And we come to accept all of that
as just part of being human.
And then what we realize is that everybody
is having the same experience.
Everybody's minds are messy and chaotic,
and everybody has thoughts
they're not proud of
and impulses they don't like.
And when we realize that, we come
to have a lot more
compassion for ourselves
and for other people, there's
a lot more acceptance.
The idea is that we move from
a place of wanting the world
to conform to what we like and don't like.
We move from that place to
not needing other people
to be different from who they are,
realizing that each of us
is just showing up in the world as we are,
and that's something to be
celebrated and accepted.
Well, the main explicit
goal of Zen is nothing.
Zen is a practice.
Now, the side effect of
practice is waking up.
Waking up really means
understanding more deeply the truth
of what it means to be alive,
the truth, for example,
that everything is constantly
changing, including me,
that even the things that
look like they are fixed
and stable are always in a process
of continual change.
That's really helpful because
often we try to fix things.
We try to hold on to things
and make them stay the same,
and we suffer a lot when we do that.
So learning about the truth
of what we call impermanence
relieves a lot of suffering
that we inflict on ourselves.
I would rate the concept of
impermanence as number one,
as the greatest hit of Zen Buddhism.
Basically, the idea of everything
constantly changing means
that Bob has no fixed self or identity.
Bob is always fluid.
I am always in the process of change,
and I'm always connected with other people
and other things in the world
that are themselves changing.
And so there's nothing fixed.
There's nothing to hold
onto in the deepest sense.
And that on the one
hand, that can be scary.
On the other hand, it
can be an enormous relief
because we tell ourselves so
many stories about who we are
and who we're supposed to be
and how the world is supposed to be.
And when we really know
the truth of impermanence,
we let a lot of that go.
One of the things that impermanence
helps us understand is the ebb
and flow of all of our experience.
So when we really get
that everything arises
and then passes away, that means
that my annoyance at this
other person is only temporary.
It's not going to stay
the same no matter what.
All you have to do is watch
an emotion for long enough,
and you'll see that it changes.
That's helpful when we're
caught in the middle
of some unhappy relationship,
some unhappy argument
or something going on with another person
where we can fall back on that awareness
that it is not gonna
feel this way forever.
In fact, it's probably
not gonna feel this way
an hour from now, certainly
not a day from now
or a week from now.
And keeping that long-term perspective
of impermanence can go a long way
to make us feel more accepting of the ups
and downs of a relationship
in any given moment.
The four noble truths
are perhaps the most iconic
teachings of the Buddha.
They're translated in many different ways,
but they start with the Buddhist statement
that life is suffering
or better translated
I think, life is unsatisfactory,
that there are always aspects
to life that we don't like,
and that that's an inevitable
part of being alive.
And then the second
teaching is that the source
of suffering is known, that it is greed
and aversion or hatred
and ignorance that
suffering can be relieved.
That's the third truth.
And the fourth truth is
that there is a way of life
that the Buddha called the eightfold path
that can help relieve all
this suffering in life.
It's often said that
the Buddha was teaching
that you could get to a point
where you never suffer anymore.
Zen does not teach that.
Zen does not teach that anybody
finally arrives at a place
where we don't ever feel pain,
where we don't ever feel
worry or unhappiness.
Rather, what we can do is learn to be
with what's unsatisfactory
in life, learn to be
with unhappiness, even
be with pain in a way
that makes it more bearable, in a way
that doesn't layer on optional suffering.
The optional suffering
being the stories we tell
about how unfair it all is.
For example, that I have back pain
or how unfair it is
that I've got a cold today,
that all of these things are workable.
But Zen teaches that unsatisfactoriness
is always there in life,
and that we do have preferences
that we're never going
to completely give up our preferences,
but that what we can do is
learn to cling less tightly
to our preferences.
In other words, to insist less
that the world be a certain way.
I mean, think about in
relationships how much we try
to insist that someone
else be a certain way
that we want them to be,
and how much less we
suffer if we let that go.
And just assume that
that person is allowed
to show up in the world as they are,
and we are allowed to show
up in the world as we are.
So this idea
of relieving suffering is in Zen,
the idea of being able to
face towards suffering,
looking at it
and living with it in
a way that hurts less.
Buddhism talks about
the idea of attachment.
And it doesn't mean attachment
in the way we normally think
of it, like just being connected
to somebody or something.
It's really about holding on tightly
to a fixed view of something.
So I'm attached to the idea
that there's one true religion
or one true political
party, or one true anything.
There's a wonderful teaching
in Zen about beginner's mind.
Beginner's mind being
the idea that we let go
of all the stories we tell
ourselves that we're so sure of
that, you know, we
become an expert in life
and an expert in ourself.
Shunryū Suzuki was a Zen master
who had a saying that I love.
He said, in the beginner's mind,
there are many possibilities.
In the expert's mind, there are few.
And what he meant by that
is when we can remain open
to many possibilities rather than
narrowing everything down
and being so sure that
we know what's what,
that we become open to
surprise, open to new ways
of experiencing ourselves
and the world that make us
suffer a great deal less
than when we are so-called experts.
And the older I get
and the more people call me
an expert, the more aware I am
of how little I know.
Having a beginner's mind
really helps in relationships
because it allows us to be curious.
It allows us to say, okay,
there's so much I don't
know about this person.
Let me watch closely.
Let me notice what I haven't
seen before about this person.
Let me find new ways to
interact with this person.
And that brings a kind of freshness
and openness to relationships that can
otherwise easily get stale.
The best definition I know
of mindfulness is simple.
It's paying attention
in the present moment
without judgment.
So it's really just paying
attention to whatever's here.
So right now, for me,
that's talking with you.
That's the feel of the chair on my back.
It's the feel of the air on my skin.
It's the sound of my voice,
kind of reverberating in my
head, all of those things.
And simply being open
to all the experiences
that are here right now,
not just the little thoughts
going on in my head.
And so mindfulness asks
us to be more expansive,
to open our awareness beyond thinking
to everything going on in the world.
You can work on it right now.
You can work on your
mindfulness right this moment
by simply paying attention
to whatever stimuli are reaching you.
It might be your heartbeat,
it might be your breath,
it might be the sound
of the fan in the room,
the traffic outside, anything.
And simply letting yourself be open
and receive whatever is here right now.
And you can do that in any moment.
You can do that when you're
sitting in a meeting.
You can do that when you're waiting
for an airplane at the airport.
You can do that when
you're driving your car.
In fact, being mindful
could be really useful
when you're driving your car.
When we really know what
it feels like to suffer,
to be in pain, to be
unhappy, to be scared,
we're better at knowing what's
coming from inside from me
and what's coming from outside.
Many times we mistake those two.
I come home
and I don't realize that
actually my knee hurts
and I find myself more
irritated at my partner.
And so one of the things that
being really mindful about
my own experience does
is it makes me a little less
likely to blame other people
for what's going on in me.
And that can be hugely helpful
when we talk about harmony
in relationships.
The other way that being mindful
about my suffering can help
in my relationships is
it helps me realize, oh,
everybody suffers in this way.
If I'm more irritable
when I'm not feeling well,
that must mean that
everybody's more irritable,
or most people are when
they're not feeling well.
And it allows me to remember
to cut people's slack when
they're not feeling well, right?
Instead of just being annoyed
that they're a little short with me.
So there are these ways that
knowing about my own discomfort
and what I do with it can be
a huge help in being empathic
toward other people.
There's a concept of meta
loving kindness in Buddhism,
and there are a couple of different ways
that it's talked about.
One is an explicit skill
that we can cultivate.
You can do a loving kindness meditation
where you think about another person
and you meditate on that other person,
and you say to yourself,
may you be peaceful,
may you be happy, may you be at peace.
And you do that over and over again,
and you come to feel differently
about the other person,
including about people
you don't like very much
or you're angry at.
So there's that way of
actively cultivating a skill.
There's another way, which is simply by
becoming more and more
aware of your own pain,
your own anxious, angry
thoughts, your own difficulties.
Because what happens when
we become more aware of that
through meditation, for
example, is that we become
much more empathic toward other people.
And naturally that kind
of loving kindness arises
where we see an angry person
and say, oh, I wonder if that person
is having a terrible day,
rather than immediately
reacting with our own anger.
That's a different way to
cultivate loving kindness.
But it happens pretty
reliably through meditation.
There's a lot of talk about enlightenment.
It's a concept that's
very old in Buddhism,
but also in other spiritual traditions.
And it can mean so many different things.
But in my Zen tradition,
it really refers to waking up
to the truth of what life is
and to some of the surprising aspects
of life that we don't normally see.
Most specifically, the interconnectedness
of everything, the essential
oneness of everything.
That yes, on one level,
everything exists separately.
I exist separately from you,
and this chair exists separately from me.
And at the deepest level,
none of it is separate.
All of it is completely
interconnected and always changing.
That is awakening
to the truth of life.
Now, enlightenment is often held out
as a thing that we can get.
And in fact, you can read accounts
of people sitting in long
periods of meditation,
sometimes on retreats,
where they essentially have
these amazing experiences.
Sometimes they feel like
out of body experiences
and they can write elaborate descriptions
of what these are like.
And sometimes people feel like, well,
if I just have those experiences,
then I'm enlightened.
And if I had those experiences
once, I want them back.
So I want to try to get them back again.
What we teach in Zen is that
that's actually dangerous.
That nobody lives in a kind
of unusual altered state
all the time.
Most of us never do.
And if we have unusual
experiences, it's very brief,
an experience of, for example,
complete interconnectedness
and oneness cannot last.
In fact, one Zen teacher did a
set of interviews with people
who had had enlightenment experiences,
and he put them into a book.
And the title of the book
was "After The Ecstasy, The Laundry."
And what he meant by
that was that no matter
what kind of unusual we
might have of waking up
of enlightenment, we
always go back to needing
to do the laundry and
needing to brush our teeth
and needing to go to work.
That that is just how life is.
So, although most of us,
myself included, wish
that there were a way to get enlightened
and stay that way, to get to a place
where it's always blissful
and we never suffer,
I have never met a human
being on this earth
who gets to that place.
And Zen teaching is that
that's not possible.
That in fact, we move in
and out of states of being more awakened
or less awakened, that no matter
how evolved you are as a
spiritual practitioner,
you're gonna have times when
you're just all upset about
stupid stuff, when you're
just deluded, as we say.
And then you move back into periods
where you see life more clearly.
That's important for me
because if you meet people
who hold themselves out
as an ultimately enlightened person,
be very suspicious of that.
Be very suspicious of
anybody who claims to be
a perfectly evolved,
enlightened human being.
Shunryū Suzuki,
a very important Zen teacher
in the United States in the 20th century
was famous for saying
that there's no such thing
as an enlightened person.
There is only enlightened activity.
And what he meant by that was
that no person is finally fully
and forever enlightened.
There is only this moment's activity.
So if I do something that
is kind, that pays attention
to my interconnectedness with everyone
and everything, that is
enlightened activity,
if I do something that's
selfish, if I do something
that destroys the planet,
that is unenlightened activity.
And so the idea
of pursuing enlightenment
really is not pursuing
a self-improvement project.
It's pursuing a way to be
as compassionate as I can in each moment,
to pursue enlightened
activity in as many moments
as I can string together in my life.
That's the goal.
One fact about enlightenment is
that it can't be permanent.
If we really know the
truth of impermanence,
then why would enlightenment be permanent
when everything else is not?
So clearly, enlightenment
has to come and go
just like everything else.
Striving for enlightenment is
a self-improvement project.
And what we talk about
in my Zen tradition is
that we don't want to embark
on a self-improvement project.
We want to strive for greater kindness
and harmony in the world, rather than
being lost in the delusion
of an isolated permanent self.
And so really what we wanna strive for
is enlightened activity in the world.
