All

looking
 great.
 Look
 at
 the
 size
 of
 those


buttons.


>> Huge
 buttons.


>> How
 many
 rhinos
 died
 to
 provide
 those


buttons?


>> Zero
 rhinos.
 Zero
 rhinos.


>> I'm
 a
 simple
 man
 that
 lives
 by
 simple


means.
 Okay.
 Beautiful.
 Beautiful.
 And


your
 sultan
 of
 science,
 David


Freriededberg.
 What's
 the
 background


here?
 Is
 that
 in
 Is
 that
 a
 melancholy


and
 infinite
 sadness
 background?
 I'm


trying
 to
 figure
 it
 out.


>> J,
 we
 don't
 talk
 about
 my
 backgrounds.


Thank
 you.


>> It
 looks
 like
 melancholy
 and
 infinite


sadness
 by
 the
 double
 album
 by
 the


amazing
 band
 um
 Smashing
 Pumpkins.
 Am
 I


close
 or
 is
 it
 the
 original
 artwork
 of


that?


>> Don't
 talk
 about
 my
 backgrounds.


>> You
 don't
 talk
 about
 your
 backgrounds.


Talk
 about
 your
 background.
 much
 giving


me
 so
 much
 to
 work
 with
 here.
 Luckily,
 I


have
 my
 straight
 man,
 my
 brother
 in


arms,
 my
 Davos
 party
 crashing
 partner,


David
 Saxs.


>> I
 got
 you
 your
 first
 invite
 to
 something


elite
 and
 exclusive.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 got
 invited
 to
 go
 25
 years


ago.
 They
 just
 wanted
 50
 dimes,
 but
 we


had
 a
 fun
 time.


>> Yeah,
 we
 had
 a
 good
 time.


>> We
 had
 a
 good
 time.


Uh
 any
 uh
 post
 Davos
 WF
 impressions?
 We


had
 a
 lot
 of
 interesting
 meetings.
 So


most
 of
 which
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 can
 talk


about
 on
 air,
 but
 um
 yeah,
 it
 was
 it
 was


an
 interesting
 uh
 interesting
 event.


>> We
 were
 staying
 in
 a
 log
 cabin
 that
 was


like
 300
 years
 old.
 The
 ceilings
 were


like
 six
 feet
 high
 and
 the
 door
 frames


were
 like
 5t
 high.
 So
 bumped
 our
 heads
 a


couple
 of
 times.


>> Yeah,


>> it
 was
 pretty
 crazy.


>> It
 was
 brutal.
 I
 mean,


>> it
 looked
 good
 on
 the
 web.
 The
 photos
 of


the
 place
 looked
 amazing.


>> The
 Airbnb
 photos
 look
 great.


>> Yeah.
 But,
 uh,
 I
 think
 you
 need
 to
 be


inside
 the
 circle.
 You
 need
 to
 be
 inside


the
 thick
 of
 it.
 Not
 driving
 in
 every


day,
 but
 it
 was
 a
 distinctly
 different


Davos.
 Uh,
 we've
 mocked
 Davos
 here
 for


many
 years,


but
 this
 one
 was
 a
 business
 takeover
 and


a
 Trump
 takeover.


>> Correct.


>> Chimath,
 you
 would
 have
 loved
 it.
 It
 was


1.5
 days
 of
 everybody
 hand
 ringing
 of


what
 Donald
 Trump
 would
 say
 when
 daddy


got
 there.
 Then
 for
 the
 75
 minutes
 daddy


gave
 his
 talk,
 the
 entire
 city
 shut


down.
 Everybody
 ran
 to
 a
 television
 set.


Then
 for
 the
 next
 1.5
 days,
 everybody


talked
 about
 what
 Trump
 said.


>> Basically,
 I
 think
 there
 are
 two
 really


big
 differences
 with
 the
 Davos
 based
 on


what
 I
 heard
 because
 this
 is
 the
 first


time
 I've
 attended.
 one
 is
 it
 was
 much


more
 business-
 ccentric
 and
 then
 second


there
 were
 a
 lot
 more
 Americans
 there
 a


much
 bigger
 American
 presence
 and
 I


think
 that
 that
 owes
 to
 the
 fact
 that


President
 Trump
 gave
 a
 major
 speech


there
 and
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Larry
 Fank


who's
 chairman
 of
 the
 whole
 thing
 now


who
 sort
 of
 orchestrated
 that


>> and
 he
 he
 wanted
 to
 get
 President
 Trump


there
 and
 I
 think
 he's
 pushed


>> for
 them
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 more


business
 centric
 and
 it
 feels
 like


they're
 catering
 a
 little
 bit
 less
 to


kind
 of
 boutique


European
 political
 issues,
 although


that's
 clearly
 a
 big
 part
 of
 it.
 I
 would


say
 in
 terms
 of
 memorable
 moments,
 a
 big


one
 was
 I'm
 only
 going
 to
 talk
 about


this
 because
 I
 think
 it
 was
 publicly


reported
 otherwise
 I
 wouldn't
 bring
 it


up,
 but
 there
 was
 this
 opening
 night


dinner
 and
 so
 Larry
 Fink
 calls
 on
 like


five
 people
 to
 give
 little
 speeches
 and


the
 last
 one
 he
 called
 on
 was
 Howard


Lutnik,
 our
 Secretary
 of
 Commerce.
 And


Howard
 just
 goes
 up
 there
 and
 he
 just


starts
 dropping
 truth
 bombs
 on
 them
 and


and
 uh
 and
 again
 he
 said
 all
 this
 on
 the


record
 in
 his
 remarks
 at
 Davos
 I
 think


either
 that
 day
 or
 the
 next
 day.
 So


again
 I'm
 not
 talking
 out
 of
 school.
 It


was
 all
 stuff
 that
 he
 said
 but
 basically


he
 said
 to
 like
 all
 the
 Europeans
 he


said
 look
 I've
 been
 coming
 here
 for
 30


years
 and
 you
 guys
 have
 completely


failed.
 You've
 wrecked
 your
 economies


with
 all
 this
 net
 zero
 stuff
 and
 climate


change
 and
 energy.
 and
 he
 just
 started


blasting
 on
 that
 and
 then
 all
 the
 open


border
 stuff.
 He
 really
 let
 them
 have


it.
 I
 mean,
 he
 was
 really
 the
 truth.
 And


then
 there
 was
 this
 uncomfortable
 like


rustling
 in
 the
 audience,
 you
 know,
 as


he
 was
 like
 gathering
 steam
 and
 then


it's
 been
 reported
 Al
 Gore
 started


booing
 at
 the
 end.


>> Drunk
 on
 Chardonnay.
 Is
 that
 true?


I
 can't
 verify
 that
 it
 was
 Al
 Gore,
 but


I
 definitely
 heard
 somebody.
 And
 I
 think


it
 was
 Al
 Gore
 who
 was


>> just
 like
 the
 two
 guys
 from
 the
 Muppets


in
 the
 Balcony,
 Statatler
 and
 whoever.


And
 it
 was
 just
 like
 Waldorf
 and


Statler.


>> Well,
 look,
 I
 mean,


>> yeah,
 Walder
 and
 Statler.


>> This
 whole
 climate
 change
 thing
 was
 Al


Gore's
 big
 hoax
 going
 back
 to
 the
 '9s.


And


>> well,
 did
 he
 win
 an
 Oscar?
 He
 won
 an


Oscar.
 I
 mean,
 and
 even
 absolutely
 Bill


Gates
 has
 acknowledged
 that
 this
 is
 not


an
 existential
 threat.
 It
 can
 be
 dealt


with,


>> you
 know.
 So
 I
 think
 the
 bloom
 is
 off


the
 rose
 in
 terms
 of
 that
 whole
 agenda


>> I'd
 say
 at
 Davos.
 Although
 to
 be
 sure


I'd
 say
 most
 people
 there
 still
 probably


agree
 with
 Al
 Gore.
 I
 mean
 they
 haven't


changed
 their
 policies.
 I'm
 talking


about
 the
 European
 countries
 even
 though


it's
 wrecking
 their
 economies.


>> They
 are
 beholden
 to
 this
 net
 zero
 idea.


>> It
 feels
 like
 they're
 in
 transition
 and


scrambling
 to
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 where


they
 what
 direction
 they
 should
 go
 in.


they
 don't
 feel
 they
 can
 trust
 America


or
 that
 we're
 not
 their
 like
 reliable


partner.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 bail
 them


out.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 protect
 them,


etc.
 And
 they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 sort


of
 get
 together
 as
 the
 mids
 mid-tier


economies,
 economies
 5
 through
 20,
 and


they're
 going
 to
 just
 have
 to
 build


their
 own
 voting
 block,
 their
 own


trading
 block,
 and
 uh
 go
 it
 alone
 and


spend
 their
 own
 money.


>> They
 have
 it.
 It's
 called
 the
 EU.
 It's


just
 yeah


>> has
 not
 been
 very
 successful
 because
 I


think
 of
 their
 own
 policies,
 their


energy
 policies
 and
 the
 open
 border


policies.


>> I'm
 not
 sure
 what
 going
 it
 alone
 means


if
 you
 don't
 have


>> best-in-class
 AI
 or
 best-in-class


weapons.


>> Absolutely.
 I
 I
 think
 it
 means
 they're


going
 to
 have
 to
 start
 investing
 in


those
 things,
 buying
 weapons,
 making


weapons
 means
 much
 of
 anything.


>> Yeah.
 I
 I
 think
 it
 means
 Canada


and
 the
 EU
 and
 all
 these
 other
 countries


that
 feel,
 hey,
 we're
 we're
 we're
 gonna


have
 our
 rug
 pulled
 by
 the
 Trump


administration.
 We're
 just
 going
 to
 have


to
 band
 together
 and
 create
 commerce.


And
 we
 saw
 China
 and
 uh
 Canada
 do
 a
 big


deal.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 them
 just


trying
 to
 say,
 hey,
 we
 have
 some


sovereignty
 here.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 a


partnership
 with
 Canada
 and
 bring
 BYD


cars
 in
 here.
 And
 hey,
 they'll
 be
 our


big
 trading
 partner.
 So,
 you
 know,


that's
 the
 reaction
 I
 think
 on
 the
 other


side.


>> But
 they
 don't


>> they
 don't
 what


>> they
 don't
 have
 as
 many
 degrees
 of


freedom
 as
 they
 think
 they
 do
 because


great
 powers
 define
 the
 international


system,
 not
 mid-tier
 powers.
 And
 a
 bunch


of
 second
 or
 third
 tier
 powers
 cannot


redefine
 the
 international
 system
 even


if
 they
 band
 together.
 And
 I
 think
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 Europeans,
 they


understand
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 United


States
 and
 specifically
 they
 want
 to


keep
 the
 US
 in
 Europe.
 I
 mean,
 they're


desperate
 to
 keep
 NATO
 together
 and
 to


keep
 the
 US
 interested
 and
 present
 in


Europe
 because
 just
 remember
 European


history
 before
 the
 Americans
 were
 there.


It's
 like
 hundreds
 of
 years
 of
 wars
 and


constantly
 fighting
 each
 other.


>> Exactly.


>> Culminating
 in
 World
 War
 I,
 World
 War


II,
 basically
 the
 total
 self-destruction


of
 Europe.
 And
 the
 most
 peaceful
 period


they've
 ever
 experienced
 has
 been
 post


1945
 when
 the
 Americans
 are
 there
 as
 the


great
 pacifier.
 So,
 they
 do
 not
 want
 us


leaving.
 And
 I
 think
 they're
 willing
 to


make
 large
 concessions
 to
 the
 US
 to


ensure
 that
 we
 stay
 there,
 even
 though


they'll
 probably
 grumble
 about
 it.
 But
 I


think
 that
 to
 that
 end,
 I
 think
 that


what
 President
 Trump
 was
 saying
 is,


look,
 you
 guys
 got
 to
 share
 in
 the


burden
 here.
 We've
 been
 paying
 for
 this


whole
 thing.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 it
 makes
 total
 sense.
 And
 they


got
 their
 spending
 up
 to
 3%
 for
 NATO
 and


they're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 five.
 So,
 mission


accomplished
 on
 that.


>> Yes.
 And
 on
 Greenland,
 he's
 like,
 look,


you
 know,
 we
 we
 we
 was
 the
 best
 part
 of


the
 speech.
 He's
 like,


>> "Do
 you
 want
 me
 to
 talk
 about


>> for
 you?


>> You
 got
 to
 do
 something
 for
 us.
 This
 has


got
 to
 be
 a
 choice."


>> He
 gets
 45
 minutes
 in.
 He's
 like,
 "Do


you
 want
 me
 to
 talk
 about
 Greenland?
 I


could
 talk
 about
 it.
 I
 You
 ready?
 I'm


going
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 right
 now."
 And


then
 he
 starts
 talking
 about
 it.
 But


then
 he
 starts
 calling
 it
 Iceland.
 And


everybody
 in
 the
 room's
 like,
 "Wait,
 he


wants
 Iceland,
 too?"
 And
 the
 whole
 buzz


was
 Trump's
 going
 to
 take
 Iceland
 and


Greenland.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 he
 sort


of
 backed
 down,
 but
 we're
 not
 going
 to


invade.
 And
 then
 there
 was
 like
 a
 sort


of
 sigh
 of
 relief.
 But
 do
 you
 think
 they


actually
 thought
 Sachs
 that
 he
 was
 going


to
 invade
 Greenland
 to
 take
 it?


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 think
 that


obviously
 they
 thought
 it
 was
 a


possibility,
 but
 the
 president
 took
 the


use
 of
 force
 off
 the
 table.
 And
 yeah,
 I


think
 you
 did
 feel
 a
 sigh
 of
 relief


there.
 I
 think
 you're
 right.
 But
 I
 think


that
 also,
 I
 mean,
 we
 don't
 know
 the


details.
 They
 haven't
 been
 publicly


reported,
 but
 there
 was
 some
 sort
 of


meeting
 at
 Davos
 that
 was
 convened,
 I


think,
 by
 the
 NATO
 Secretary
 General,


Mark
 Ruda,
 where
 they
 negotiated
 an


acceptable
 compromise
 on
 the
 issue.
 So,


I'm
 sure
 we'll
 find
 out
 the
 details
 in


due
 course,
 but
 it's
 safe
 to
 say
 that


President
 Trump
 got
 enough
 of
 what
 he


wanted
 that
 he
 was
 satisfied
 with
 what


they
 worked
 out.


>> I
 don't
 know
 how
 they
 just
 like
 it's


like
 Lucy
 with
 the
 uh
 football
 and


Charlie.
 It's
 like
 he's
 gonna
 pull
 the


football.
 Like
 he's
 just
 anchoring
 the


ne
 negotiations
 at
 a
 military
 invasion


and
 takeover.
 He
 obviously
 is
 just
 going


to
 go
 for
 a
 lease.
 It's
 like
 they
 they


don't
 know
 it
 in
 year,
 you
 know,


whatever
 we're
 in
 now,
 year
 five
 or
 six,


year
 six
 of
 Trump
 being
 president.
 Like


they
 should
 get
 it
 by
 now.
 He
 just


anchors
 things
 at
 an
 impossible
 insane


level
 and
 then
 he
 falls
 back
 to
 whatever


he
 really
 wanted.
 It's
 a
 classic


negotiating
 technique.
 All right,
 we
 got


a
 lot
 on
 the
 docket.
 Let's
 get
 to
 work.


Everyone
 wants
 to
 hear
 four
 venture


capitalists
 and
 investors
 talk
 about
 the


horrific
 situation
 in
 Minneapolis.
 So,


here
 we
 go.
 Uh,
 for
 background,
 I
 mean,


Jason,


>> for
 background,
 last
 month,
 the
 DHS


started
 an
 operation
 called
 Metro
 Surge,


sending
 3,000
 federal
 agents
 into


Minnesota
 to
 crack
 down
 on
 illegal


aliens.
 Over
 the
 last
 3
 weeks,
 two


motans
 were
 tragically
 killed
 in


altercations
 with
 federal
 agents.


January
 7th,
 37year-old
 Renee
 Good
 was


shot
 to
 death
 by
 an
 ICE
 agent.
 This


incident
 involved
 Good
 accelerating
 her


car,
 which
 was
 surrounded
 by
 agents
 at


the
 time.
 We're
 still
 waiting
 for
 the


final
 investigation
 on
 this
 one,
 but


apparently
 three
 shots,
 one
 through
 the


front
 windshield,
 perhaps
 two
 through


the
 side.
 Uh,
 all
 these
 details
 are


still
 being
 investigated.
 Then


tragically
 on
 January
 24th,
 Alex
 Prey,


also
 37,
 was
 shot
 and
 killed
 by
 two


border
 patrol
 agents,
 not
 ICE.
 Prey
 was


an
 ICU
 nurse
 at
 the
 local
 VA
 hospital.


There's
 a
 ton
 of
 frame
 by
 frame


breakdowns
 available.
 New
 York
 Times
 and


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 did
 a
 good
 job
 on


these.
 So,
 I
 think
 maybe
 it's
 best
 for


us
 to
 focus
 here
 on
 maybe
 the
 aftermath


of
 all
 this
 and
 the
 resolution,
 but
 you


guys
 can
 feel
 free
 to
 chime
 in
 on
 the


frame
 by
 frame
 breakdowns
 if
 you
 like.


In
 five
 parts,
 Steven
 Miller
 tweeted


that
 Freddy
 was
 an
 assassin
 trying
 to


murder
 federal
 agents.
 A
 source
 told


Axis
 that
 Gnome
 said,
 "Everything
 I've


done,
 I've
 done
 at
 the
 direction
 of
 the


president
 and
 Stephen,
 Steven
 being


Steven
 Miller.
 Greg
 Bovino
 uh
 has
 been


removed
 from
 duty
 and
 had
 his
 social


media
 accounts
 turned
 off.
 President


Trump
 has
 pivoted,
 evolved


and
 put
 Tom
 Hman
 in
 charge."
 Quote,
 "Tom


is
 tough
 but
 fair
 and
 will
 report


directly
 to
 me,"
 Trump
 wrote.
 And
 uh
 at


the
 time
 of
 this
 taping,
 which
 is
 on


Thursday's
 uh
 there
 was
 a
 press


conference
 this
 morning
 and
 here
 is
 what


Tom
 Holman
 said
 and
 after
 30
 seconds


we'll
 go
 to
 you
 Saxs
 for
 your
 reaction


to
 all
 this.


>> No
 agency
 organization
 is
 perfect.


President
 Trump
 and
 I
 along
 with
 others


in
 administration
 have
 recognized
 that


certain
 improvements
 could
 and
 should
 be


made.
 That's
 exactly
 what
 I'm
 doing


here.
 So
 if
 we
 get
 these
 agreements
 in


place,
 that
 means
 less
 agents
 on
 the


street,
 more
 agents
 in
 the
 jail.
 Matter


of
 fact,
 I
 have
 staff
 from
 CBP
 and
 from


ICE
 working
 on
 a
 draw
 down
 plan.
 What


does
 that
 look
 like
 based
 on
 the


cooperation?


>> Sax,
 your
 thoughts?


>> Well,
 first
 let
 me
 say
 the
 deaths
 of


Renee
 Good
 and
 Alex
 Petty
 are


regrettable
 and
 and
 tragic.
 So
 are
 the


deaths
 of
 Lincoln
 Riley,
 Joselyn


Nungare,
 Rachel
 Morren,
 Victoria


Harwell,
 Ivory
 Smith,
 and
 too
 many


others
 to
 mention
 who
 are
 murdered
 by


criminal
 illegal
 aliens.
 And
 the
 media


won't
 ever
 tell
 you
 their
 names.
 But


President
 Trump
 was
 hired
 by
 the


American
 people
 to
 do
 a
 job,
 which
 is
 to


seal
 the
 border
 and
 deport
 criminal


aliens
 so
 that
 more
 of
 these
 tragedies


do
 not
 occur
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 this
 is


a
 popular
 policy.
 Over
 55%
 of
 the


American
 people
 say
 they
 want
 all


illegal
 aliens
 deported
 and
 over
 90%


want
 criminal
 aliens
 removed.
 And
 by


criminal
 aliens,
 I'm
 referring
 to
 the


ones
 who
 commit
 additional
 crimes
 after


they
 enter
 the
 country
 illegally.
 Now,


this
 policy
 is
 working.
 Uh
 murders
 were


down
 21%
 last
 year.
 It's
 one
 of
 the
 best


years
 in
 record.
 And
 in
 most
 states,
 the


process
 is
 smooth
 and
 doesn't
 make


national
 news.
 And
 the
 reason
 for
 that


is
 because
 local
 authorities
 are


cooperating
 with
 ICE.
 But
 Minneapolis


has
 taken
 a
 different
 approach.
 They've


engaged
 in
 a
 campaign
 of
 quote
 massive


resistance
 to
 federal
 authorities.
 So


let's
 talk
 about
 what's
 actually


happening
 there
 on
 the
 ground.
 I
 think


the
 first
 thing
 to
 understand
 is
 that


what's
 happening
 is
 much
 more
 than
 just


protests.
 And
 obviously
 I
 have
 no


problem
 with
 people
 peacefully


protesting
 and
 making
 their
 opinions


known,
 but
 that's
 not
 what's
 going
 on


here.
 These
 are
 Antifa
 style
 operations


designed
 to
 thwart


the
 enforcement
 of
 federal
 immigration


law.
 They're
 highly
 organized.
 They're


communicating
 in
 encrypted
 chat
 groups.


They
 stalk
 and
 dox
 ICE
 agents.
 They


follow
 them
 around
 town.
 They
 surround


them
 at
 their
 hotels.
 They
 use
 their


cars
 to
 block
 roads.
 And
 they
 use


bullhorns
 and
 whistles
 to
 alert


criminals
 who
 are
 about
 to
 be
 arrested.


And
 remember,
 ICE
 is
 a
 law
 enforcement


agency.
 They
 have
 warrants
 to
 arrest


known
 criminal
 aliens.
 Despite
 this


rhetoric
 of
 them
 being
 like
 the
 Gustapo,


they
 are
 going
 after
 specific
 named


individuals
 for
 whom
 they
 have
 warrants


to
 arrest.
 These
 are
 dangerous
 missions


and
 these
 agitators
 are
 interfering
 and


making
 these
 missions
 even
 more


dangerous.
 Now,
 the
 media
 has
 tried
 to


portray
 good
 and
 pretty
 as
 simply


innocent
 bystanders
 or
 people
 who
 were


peacefully
 protesting
 ICE
 policies.
 They


weren't.
 They
 were
 foot
 soldiers
 in


these
 Antifa
 style
 operations
 and
 most


importantly
 they
 brought
 deadly
 weapons


to
 the
 fight.
 So
 Renee
 Good
 hit
 an


officer
 with
 her
 SUV
 which
 under
 a


Minnesota
 law
 signed
 by
 Tim
 Waltz


himself
 in
 2020
 justifies
 the
 use
 of


deadly
 force
 by
 an
 officer
 to
 defend


himself.
 And
 Alex
 Prey
 was
 even
 more


reckless.
 I
 think
 we've
 probably
 all


seen
 the
 video
 by
 now
 where
 he
 sought


confrontation
 with
 ICE
 officials.
 He
 was


kicking
 the
 car.
 He
 was
 in
 a
 rage.
 This


wasn't
 his
 first
 time
 doing
 this.
 And


any
 experienced
 gun
 owner
 will
 tell
 you


that
 if
 you're
 armed
 and
 you're
 dealing


with
 law
 enforcement,
 you
 have
 to
 be
 the


world's
 biggest
 pacifist
 because
 you're


putting
 your
 life
 in
 danger
 by
 making


them
 fear
 that
 their
 lives
 are
 in


danger.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 mainstream
 media


didn't
 tell
 people
 these
 facts.
 They


just
 presented
 highly
 selective
 camera


angles.
 They
 even
 airbrushed
 and


facetuned
 Prey
 to
 make
 him
 appear
 to
 be


a
 more,
 I
 guess,
 handsome
 victim,
 which


is
 truly
 sick.
 Now,
 in
 a
 way,
 I
 feel


sorry
 for
 Good
 and
 Pretty
 because
 they


were
 the
 victims
 of
 a
 tinder
 box
 that


was
 created
 in
 Minnesota
 by
 the
 extreme


rhetoric
 and
 decisions
 of
 Tim
 Waltz,


Jacob
 Fry,
 and
 the
 political


establishment.
 The
 local
 police
 in


Minneapolis
 should
 have
 been
 allowed
 to


keep
 conditions
 safe
 on
 the
 street
 by


creating
 a
 perimeter
 and
 keeping


protesters
 away
 from
 ICE
 officers
 who


were
 executing
 lawful
 warrants
 of


arrest.
 But
 the
 police
 were
 told
 not
 to.


And
 then
 the
 agitators
 stepped
 in
 and


they
 took
 advantage
 of
 this
 sort
 of


vacuum
 of
 authority
 to
 physically


intervene.
 So
 I
 think
 it
 was
 almost


inevitable
 that
 some
 sort
 of
 tragedy
 was


going
 to
 result
 from
 this
 abdication
 of


public
 safety.
 Now
 why
 would
 Walson
 Frey


want
 to
 risk
 such
 tragedies
 with
 their


massive
 resistance?
 I
 think
 there's
 two


reasons
 for
 this.
 This
 is
 the
 last
 point


I
 want
 to
 make.
 First,
 they
 are


desperate
 to
 change
 the
 subject
 from
 the


billions
 of
 dollars
 of
 fraud
 that
 they


allow
 to
 occur
 on
 their
 watch.
 Remember


we
 had
 Nick
 Shirley
 on
 the
 show
 just
 a


few
 weeks
 ago
 talking
 about
 the
 8


billion
 so
 that
 was
 stolen
 by
 Somali


fraudsters
 and
 this
 campaign
 of


resistance
 in
 Minneapolis
 has
 done
 a


really
 good
 job
 making
 everyone
 forget


about
 that.
 But
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 second


and
 bigger
 reason
 that
 applies
 and
 I


think
 it
 applies
 to
 to
 national


Democrats
 which
 is
 they
 want
 to
 thwart


mass
 deportations
 because
 illegal


immigrants
 are
 a
 vital
 part
 of
 their


power
 base.
 And
 you
 can
 see
 this
 in
 the


2030
 aortionment
 forecast
 which
 just


came
 out.
 Illegal
 aliens
 count
 towards


the
 census
 which
 occurs
 every
 decade.


And
 the
 census
 determines
 the


aortionment
 of
 congressional
 seats
 and


electoral
 votes.
 And
 what
 you
 see
 in


these
 maps
 is
 that


citizens
 of
 blue
 states
 have
 been


migrating
 to
 red
 states
 because
 those


blue
 states
 are
 failing.
 And
 as
 a
 result


of
 that,
 blue
 states
 are
 expected
 to


lose
 nine
 house
 seats
 and
 electoral


votes
 because
 of
 the
 changing
 population


numbers.
 Illegal
 aliens
 in
 blue
 states


have
 been
 propping
 up
 those
 numbers.
 And


so,
 for
 example,
 in
 the
 last
 election,


President
 Trump
 would
 have
 won
 an


additional
 nine
 electoral
 votes


if
 we
 had
 an
 accurate
 counting.
 So,


look,
 this
 is
 not
 about
 principle.
 This


is
 bare
 knuckle
 politics.
 The
 Democrats


are
 playing
 for
 keeps.
 They
 don't
 really


care
 how
 many
 innocent
 Americans
 get


hurt
 or
 killed
 in
 the
 process.
 This
 is


about
 thwarting
 a
 popular
 policy
 of


deportations


and
 sealing
 the
 border
 which
 the


American
 people
 voted
 for.
 So
 don't
 let


the
 media
 fool
 you.


>> Freedber
 Chimath,
 you
 want
 to
 give
 your


opinion
 on
 these
 two
 tragic
 deaths


>> or
 not?
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 feel
 you're


obligated
 to
 comment
 on
 this
 if
 you


don't
 want
 to.


>> I'm
 happy
 to.


Nick,
 I
 sent
 a
 clip
 into
 the
 chat.


>> Deported
 all
 immigrants
 who
 are
 here


illegally,
 55%
 of
 the
 New
 York
 Times,


Marquette,
 64%.
 CBS
 News,
 57%.
 ABC
 News


with
 a
 slightly
 different
 question,
 56%.


So,
 what
 you're
 seeing
 essentially
 here


is
 a
 very
 clear
 indication
 that
 a


majority
 of
 Americans,
 in
 fact,
 when


they're
 asked
 this
 blunt
 question,
 which


I
 believe
 gets
 at
 the
 underlying


feelings,
 do
 in
 fact
 want
 to
 deport
 all


immigrants
 who
 are
 here
 illegally.


There's
 no
 arguing
 with
 these
 different


numbers
 cuz
 they're
 all
 essentially
 the


same
 across
 four
 different
 pollsters.


>> I
 think
 Sax
 is
 right
 that
 there's
 a
 very


very
 vocal
 minority.
 But
 if
 we
 just
 put


that
 aside,
 it's
 important
 right
 now
 to


just
 stick
 to
 the
 facts.
 Democracy
 is


supposed
 to
 be
 the
 will
 of
 the
 majority,


but
 also
 defense
 and
 protection
 for
 the


minority.
 In
 this
 example,
 the
 will
 of


the
 majority
 is
 pretty
 clear.
 As
 the
 CNN


clip
 just
 showed,
 everybody
 wanted
 the


southern
 border
 shut
 and
 the
 northern


border
 shut


and
 a
 structured
 path
 to
 deal
 with


illegal
 immigration.
 David's
 right
 that


that
 creates
 a
 cascade
 of
 second
 and


third
 order
 effects


that
 have
 huge
 implications
 with
 respect


to
 the
 Democrats
 and
 their
 ability
 to


have
 and
 curate
 power.


I
 don't
 know
 whether
 this
 is
 what's


motivating
 them
 or
 not.
 I
 don't
 want
 to


speculate
 on
 that.
 But
 the
 conceptual


problem
 and
 the
 conceptual
 desire
 of


Americans
 is
 undisputable.
 I
 think


that's
 why
 Donald
 Trump
 won.
 Now
 I
 think


though
 we
 have
 to
 explore
 the
 tactics.


I
 think
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 both
 of


these
 two
 deaths
 were
 complete
 and
 total


tragedies


and
 it
 has
 created
 such
 an
 upswell


that
 it
 has
 the
 potential
 to
 spin
 out
 of


control.
 And
 if
 it
 does
 that,
 it
 risks


his
 ability
 to
 continue
 doing
 his
 job


and
 delivering
 on
 the
 conceptual
 promise


that
 everybody
 wants.
 The
 other
 thing
 is


that
 I
 think
 that
 he
 has
 otherwise,
 the


president,
 done
 an
 incredible
 job
 up


until
 now.
 The
 fact
 that
 Tom
 Hman
 is


going
 there
 is
 a
 really
 good
 thing.
 He


was
 the
 same
 person
 that
 was
 awarded
 a


medal
 by
 Obama
 for
 how
 he
 managed


Obama's
 deportation
 process.
 It's
 time


to
 just
 get
 control
 of
 the
 process
 and


dial
 down
 the
 temperature
 because
 the


structural
 things
 that
 they
 are
 doing


are
 correct.
 There
 are
 people
 here
 that


broke
 the
 law.
 There
 are
 criminals
 that


are
 here
 illegally.
 We
 need
 to
 remove


them
 because
 that
 is
 the
 will
 of
 the


majority.
 Now
 we
 just
 need
 to
 find
 a
 way


of
 doing
 it
 that
 creates
 some
 freedom
 to


operate
 for
 all
 of
 law
 enforcement
 so


that
 these
 tragedies
 stop.
 That's
 my
 two


cents.


>> Okay.
 Freedberg,
 would
 you
 like
 to


comment
 on
 this
 or
 pass?
 I


>> I'll
 comment.
 Can
 I
 just
 ask
 you
 to


react
 to
 what
 Sach
 said?
 Do
 you
 agree
 or


disagree
 with
 his
 point
 about
 the


Democrats
 needing
 to
 remove
 people


because
 they
 do
 count
 in
 the
 census
 and


they
 increase
 the
 seats
 in
 the
 House.


>> Elon's
 talked
 about
 this
 a
 whole
 bunch


as
 well
 that
 the
 immigration
 is
 being


done
 to
 boost
 the
 voter
 roles.
 I
 don't


know
 enough
 about
 the
 census


specifically
 because
 that
 occurs
 x


number
 of
 years
 and
 uh
 if
 it's
 accurate


at
 all.
 So
 I'll
 leave
 that
 aside
 and
 do


some
 research
 on
 it.
 In
 terms
 of


importing
 people
 for
 votes,
 this
 uh


strategy
 does
 not
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 logical


sense.
 And
 so
 many
 workingclass
 people


voted
 Trump
 into
 office
 and
 so
 many


specifically
 uh
 Hispanic
 people,
 Mexican


people
 are
 all
 voting
 for
 Trump
 now


because
 he's
 a
 populist
 and
 he
 appeals


to
 to
 that
 group.
 So
 whatever
 if
 Biden


and
 the
 Democrats
 were
 doing
 that
 for


that
 reason,
 that
 makes
 no
 sense.
 And


also
 those
 people
 would
 have
 to
 become


citizens
 in
 order
 to
 vote
 and
 that's
 a


20
 30year
 process.
 So,
 you
 know,
 they'd


be
 playing
 an
 incredibly
 long
 game
 uh
 on


that
 front


>> unless
 there
 is
 cheating
 in
 the
 voting.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 we've
 talked
 about
 that
 as
 well


here.


>> For example,
 if
 there's
 no
 voter
 ID,
 you


know,


>> you
 know,
 the
 Heritage
 Foundation,
 I


think
 David,
 you
 worked
 there
 at
 some


point,
 right?
 Did
 an
 internship.


>> That
 uh
 organization,
 that
 think
 tank


has
 done
 tremendous
 research
 into
 this.


They
 have
 a
 database.
 I
 think
 they've


collected
 now
 3,000
 cases
 of
 voter
 fraud


over
 a
 40-year
 period.
 So
 really
 the


whole
 concept
 of
 voter
 forward
 being


able
 to
 tilt
 a
 presidential
 election
 is


just
 ridiculous
 and
 has
 not
 been
 proven.


I
 think
 Trump
 filed
 about
 50
 or
 60


lawsuits
 and
 lost
 all
 50
 of
 them.
 So


there's
 there's
 no
 credence
 to
 that.
 Uh


but
 you
 know
 I
 have
 a
 couple
 of
 thoughts


broader
 on
 what
 we've
 seen
 and
 I
 do


actually
 agree
 with
 you
 David.
 There


should
 be
 voter
 ID
 everywhere.
 I
 I
 don't


think
 anybody
 should
 be
 able
 to
 vote


without
 a
 driver's
 license.
 If
 you
 can't


or
 ID
 if
 you
 can't
 take
 the
 time
 to
 get


ID
 why
 should
 you
 vote?
 It
 doesn't
 make


a
 lot
 of
 sense
 right.


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 that's
 such
 a
 push
 on


the
 other
 side
 though
 Jal?
 Like
 what's


the
 motivation
 for
 not
 having
 IDs?


>> The
 stated


>> if
 it's
 not
 about
 getting
 people
 to
 vote


that
 aren't
 allowed
 to
 vote.


>> The
 stated
 reason,
 which
 I
 don't


believe,
 is
 that
 it's
 more
 democratic


and
 you
 want
 to
 get
 as
 many
 people
 to


vote
 as
 possible.
 So,
 but
 I
 don't
 agree


with
 that.
 I
 think
 everybody
 should
 have


ID.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 you
 got
 to
 have
 ID
 to
 buy
 a


beer,
 right?
 So,


>> yeah.
 I
 mean,
 to
 get
 on
 a
 plane
 to
 I


mean,
 even
 to
 ride
 a
 train,
 like
 you


need
 an
 ID.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 understand.


>> I
 think
 the
 answer
 speaks
 for
 itself.
 I


mean,
 uh,
 to
 me
 it's
 obvious
 the
 reason


why
 you
 prohibit,
 by
 the
 way,
 it's
 not


just
 saying
 you
 can
 vote
 without
 an
 ID.


They
 actually
 prohibit
 the
 people


administering
 the
 polls
 from
 checking.


There's
 only
 one
 reason
 to
 do
 that.
 You


want
 to
 allow
 cheating,
 obviously.
 And


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 Doge
 found
 was


that
 there
 were
 lots
 of
 illegal
 aliens


being
 added
 to
 the
 social
 security


roles.
 Now,
 they
 weren't
 necessarily


collecting
 social
 security,
 but
 in
 a
 lot


of


>> they
 were
 actually
 paying
 into
 it.
 So,


it
 was
 quite
 the
 opposite.
 My
 point
 is


that
 when
 you
 get
 an
 SSN
 number,
 in
 a


lot
 of
 states,
 all
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is


check
 a
 box
 when
 you
 get
 a
 driver's


license,
 which
 they
 also
 give
 to
 illegal


aliens
 in
 order
 to
 be
 added
 to
 the
 voter


roles.


>> So,
 they
 are
 finding
 illegal
 aliens
 on


voter
 roles.
 But
 look,
 regardless
 of


where
 you
 are
 on
 cheating
 in
 elections,


the
 census
 just
 counts
 total
 population


and
 then
 they
 aortion
 house
 seats
 and


electoral
 votes
 based
 on
 total


population,
 including
 illegal
 aliens.


And
 there
 is
 data
 on
 this.
 Trump
 would


have
 won
 the
 last
 election
 by
 an


additional
 nine
 electoral
 votes
 if
 these


changes
 had
 been
 made
 before
 the
 last


election
 in
 72.


>> Do
 you
 think
 uh


>> so
 just
 to
 put
 a
 pin
 on
 that
 point?
 It's


really
 important
 because
 what
 it
 means


is
 that
 a
 future
 Republican
 would
 not


need
 to
 somehow
 crack
 the
 Democrats
 blue


wall
 of
 Pennsylvania,
 Michigan,
 and


Wisconsin.
 Right?
 So
 nine
 electoral


votes
 is
 a
 lot
 and
 it
 does
 put
 the


presidency
 that
 much
 further
 out
 of


reach
 for
 future
 Democratic
 candidates.


It
 provides
 a
 powerful
 incentive
 and


it's
 again
 it's
 not
 just
 the
 electoral


votes.
 It's
 also
 these
 House
 seats.


California
 would
 have
 lost
 House
 seats.


I
 think
 it
 was
 like
 four
 if
 this
 had


been
 recognized
 because
 again
 there's


been
 a
 huge
 migration.
 Jake,
 you
 know


this
 better
 than
 anybody
 since
 you're


one
 of
 the
 people
 who've
 left.
 The
 state


is
 so
 badly
 mismanaged
 that
 people
 have


been
 fleeing
 blue
 states
 in
 droves.
 And


the
 fact
 that
 you've
 got
 illegal
 aliens


then
 replacing
 that
 population
 mass
 that


effect
 and
 allows
 these
 blue
 states
 to


maintain
 their
 level
 of
 representation


in
 the
 house.
 That
 is
 a
 huge
 incentive.


>> Freeberg,
 do
 you
 support


the
 use
 of
 ICE
 agents
 DHS
 to
 go
 into


these
 cities
 and
 do
 you
 think
 they
 were


too
 violent?
 And


do
 you
 agree
 with
 that
 strategy
 that


Trump's
 now
 seems
 like
 pulling
 back?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 know
 the
 answer.
 We
 talked


about
 it
 on
 private
 chat.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 I'll
 be
 very
 matter
 of
 fact.


>> Yeah.


>> Neither
 of
 these
 people
 should
 be
 dead.


It's
 sad
 that
 it
 happened.


>> Who's
 to
 blame?


>> Neither
 of
 these
 people
 should
 have
 been


doing
 what
 they
 were
 doing.


Federal
 law
 enforcement
 agents


should
 not
 wear
 masks.


They
 should
 identify
 themselves
 when


asked.
 Ideally,
 they
 wear
 body
 cams
 like


local
 law
 enforcement
 does.
 I
 like
 body


cams.
 I
 actually
 like
 watching
 videos
 of


police
 wearing
 body
 cams
 on
 YouTube
 and


Tik
 Tok.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 important


way
 to
 hold
 law
 enforcement
 accountable


to
 their
 work.
 There
 may
 be
 reasons
 why


federal
 law
 enforcement
 can't
 do
 that.


If
 they're
 undercover
 and
 whatnot,
 they


shouldn't
 have
 to
 identify
 themselves,


but
 I
 think
 those
 are
 important
 ground


rules.
 I
 think
 that
 federal
 law


enforcement
 should
 have
 warrant
 or


probable
 cause.
 They
 should
 not
 be


allowed
 to
 randomly
 ask
 people
 for


papers.


I
 don't
 agree
 with
 that.
 If
 that's
 what


they're
 doing,
 and
 I'm
 not
 saying
 that


that's
 what
 I
 agents
 are
 doing.


>> No,
 no,
 that's
 what
 they
 were
 doing.


That's
 all
 been
 proven.


>> I
 don't
 know
 that.
 I
 don't
 know
 if


that's
 been
 proven.


>> Wearing
 masks,
 not
 identifying


themselves.


>> That's
 not
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about.
 Hold


on
 a
 second.
 Hold
 on
 a
 second.
 There


have
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 claims
 made
 that


they're
 going
 around
 quote
 rounding


people
 up
 asking
 for
 ID
 and
 papers.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 that's
 true.
 I
 have


personally
 not
 been
 convinced
 of
 that.


You
 may
 have
 seen
 something
 else,
 but


I've
 not
 been
 convinced
 of
 that.
 But
 if


that
 is
 what
 they're
 doing,
 there
 is
 no


probable
 cause
 and
 there's
 no
 warrant


attached
 to
 that.
 That
 should
 not
 be


allowed.
 I
 think
 the
 mechanism
 for


fixing
 that,
 the
 mechanism
 for


addressing
 that
 is
 number
 one
 to
 go
 to


federal
 courts
 and
 file
 injunctions,


which
 is
 actively
 happening
 through
 the


legal
 process.
 And
 there's
 a
 due
 process


that
 then
 would
 take
 place
 that
 would


determine
 whether
 these
 agents
 are


following
 the
 law
 and
 doing
 things
 by


the
 rule
 of
 law
 or
 are
 not.
 And
 if


they're
 not,
 injunctions
 will
 be
 imposed


and
 they
 can't
 do
 what
 they're
 doing.


Short
 of
 that,
 no
 one
 should
 take
 it


into
 their
 own
 hands
 to
 obstruct
 law


enforcement,
 federal
 or
 local
 law


enforcement.
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 wrong.


I
 don't
 think
 that
 individuals
 that


disagree
 with
 a
 law
 or
 disagree
 with
 the


actions
 of
 law
 enforcement
 officers


should
 obstruct
 their
 actions.
 The


correct
 path
 is
 number
 one
 to
 protest


peacefully,
 number
 two
 to
 go
 to
 the


courts
 and
 file
 injunctions,
 and
 number


three
 to
 change
 the
 law.
 To
 go
 to
 your


local,


>> vote
 for
 someone
 and
 change
 the
 law.
 I


think
 it's
 totally
 okay
 for
 protesters


to
 not
 like
 the
 law.
 There's
 a
 million


laws
 and
 regulations
 and
 other
 [ __ ]


that
 I
 fundamentally
 disagree
 with,
 but


those
 don't
 give
 me
 the
 right
 to
 impose


myself
 physically
 in
 the
 driveway
 with
 a


car
 blocking
 law
 enforcement
 from
 doing


their
 job.
 If
 law
 enforcement
 was


arresting
 a
 non-ilgal
 immigrant
 murderer


and
 someone
 did
 that,
 would
 people
 be
 up


in
 arms?
 It's
 because
 people
 disagree


with
 the
 law.
 And
 if
 you
 disagree
 with


the
 law,
 you've
 got
 to
 change
 the
 law.


And
 that's
 okay.
 Now,
 right
 now,
 it
 is


the
 case
 that
 it
 is
 the
 law
 that
 if


someone
 came
 here
 without
 going
 through


the
 immigration
 process
 as
 defined
 by


the
 law,
 then
 they
 are
 technically
 here


illegally.
 That
 is
 the
 law.
 That's
 what


it
 is.
 And
 so,
 there
 is
 a
 course
 or
 a


path
 or
 a
 point
 of
 view
 on
 how
 do
 you


enforce
 that
 law
 and
 that
 is
 what
 people


are
 having
 disagreements
 over.
 And


again,
 file
 injunctions
 if
 you
 don't


like
 the
 methods,
 change
 the
 law
 if
 you


don't
 like
 the
 law.
 My
 personal
 view
 on


immigration,
 just
 so
 I
 can
 wrap
 this
 all


up,
 I
 don't
 see
 how
 we're
 going
 to
 do


this
 in
 a
 humane
 and
 just
 way
 of


removing
 people
 from
 this
 country
 who


have
 been
 here
 for
 a
 period
 of
 time
 and


have
 paid
 taxes
 and
 have
 been
 good


contributors
 to
 this
 country.
 I
 don't


know
 how
 you're
 going to
 do
 it.
 I
 don't


know
 how
 you're
 going
 to
 do
 it
 without


inciting
 a
 civil
 war.
 So
 I
 think
 the


compromise
 has
 to
 be
 that
 there
 has
 to


be
 a
 path
 to
 permanent
 residency
 and


eventually
 citizenship
 for
 individuals


who
 have
 been
 in
 the
 United
 States
 for


some
 period
 of
 time
 who
 have
 followed


other
 laws
 who
 have
 paid
 taxes
 and
 who


have
 not
 taken
 advantage
 of
 public


services
 that
 they
 are
 not
 supposed
 to


use.
 With
 those
 conditions
 met
 there


should
 be
 some
 path
 otherwise
 we're


going
 to
 have
 civil
 war.
 I
 think
 that


separate
 to
 this
 there's
 a
 bigger
 point


to
 be
 made
 and
 Ray
 Dalio
 has
 made
 this


and
 I
 will
 restate
 it
 and
 you
 guys
 can


roll
 your
 eyes
 at
 this
 but
 I
 think
 that


there's
 a
 deep
 emotional
 driver
 to
 all


of
 this.
 People
 look
 at
 this
 and
 they


get
 incited.
 They
 get
 activated


emotionally.
 Everyone
 I
 speak
 to
 is


activated
 emotionally
 over
 this
 issue


and
 we
 have
 to
 ask
 ourselves
 the


important
 question
 of
 why
 are
 people


activated
 so
 emotionally
 right
 now?
 What


is
 going
 on?
 What
 is
 the
 fundamental


root
 cause
 of
 this?
 What
 is
 the


fundamental
 root
 cause
 of
 this


prediction
 model
 that
 Ray
 Dalio
 has


talked
 about
 saying
 that
 there's
 a
 35
 to


40%
 chance
 of
 a
 civil
 war
 in
 the
 United


States
 based
 on
 predictions
 that
 he
 made


in
 2020.
 And
 it
 is
 rooted
 fundamentally


in
 the
 fact
 that
 everyone
 to
 some
 degree


feels
 some
 amount
 of
 oppression
 right


now.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 manifestation
 of
 that


oppressed
 feeling.
 That
 oppression
 comes


from
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 world
 is
 racing


ahead
 and
 people
 are
 not
 a
 part
 of
 it.


that
 people
 feel
 like
 they're
 being
 left


behind
 and
 they
 see
 victims
 of
 that


world
 and
 they
 want
 to
 act.
 And
 I
 think


we
 need
 to
 pay
 attention
 to
 that
 and
 be


very
 cognizant
 of
 it
 because
 I
 think


fundamentally
 it
 is
 an
 inevitability


that
 there
 will
 be
 a
 civil
 war
 if
 we


don't
 recognize
 it
 and
 address
 it
 and


find
 some
 paths
 of
 compromise
 to
 solve


these
 problems.


>> Okay,
 I'm
 done.


>> Uh,
 superb.


>> So,
 it
 ship
 it.
 Episode
 done.
 I
 mean,


>> let's
 go
 home.


>> So,
 yeah,
 I'm
 strongly
 in
 agreement
 with


you.
 the
 police
 should
 um
 not
 be


interfered
 with.
 I
 said
 that
 here
 and
 I


said
 it
 on
 Twitter.
 You
 should
 stay
 home


if
 you
 can't
 peacefully
 protest
 and
 also


agree
 with
 you
 strongly.
 The
 police
 uh


should
 be
 trained
 to
 deescalate,
 wear


body
 cameras,
 not
 wear
 masks,
 be
 trained


properly,
 all
 that
 stuff.


But
 I
 I
 want
 to
 make
 three
 points
 here.


And
 the
 first
 is,
 you
 know,
 President


Trump
 has
 surrounded
 himself
 with
 a
 lot


of
 really
 competent
 people,
 yourself


included,
 David
 Rubio,
 Bessant,
 Lutnik,


Kushner.
 We
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 here.
 my


pal
 Chris
 Wright,
 but
 he's
 also


surrounded
 himself
 with
 very


inexperienced
 sick
 offense
 that
 he


picked
 based
 on
 their
 loyalty
 to
 him
 and


that
 group
 needs
 to
 go
 because
 that


group
 is
 sinking
 his
 second
 term.
 I'll


put
 on
 that
 list
 Steven
 Miller,
 Christy


Gnome,
 Cash
 Patel,
 and
 Pam
 Bondi.
 Uh


these
 folks
 have
 been
 a
 disaster
 for


Trump.
 They're
 not
 qualified
 to
 be
 in


the
 positions
 they're
 in,
 and
 they
 have


caused
 a
 lot
 of
 chaos.
 And
 back
 in


August,
 I
 explained
 exactly
 how


unpopular
 these,


you
 know,
 ICE
 actions
 were.
 And
 I


implored
 people,
 hey,
 stay
 home
 if
 you


cannot
 be
 peaceful.
 If
 you
 want
 to


record
 people,
 that's
 fine.
 But
 I


predicted
 as
 well
 that
 somebody's
 going


to
 get
 killed.
 And
 that
 these
 agents


were
 acting
 just
 without
 training.
 They


were
 not
 deescalating.
 And
 they
 were
 in


fact
 provoking
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 which
 I


think
 was
 part
 of
 the
 concept
 that


Steven
 Miller
 had
 was
 to
 provoke
 these


kind
 of
 reactions.
 Nick,
 you
 can
 pull
 up


my
 first
 chart.
 You
 remember
 back
 in


October
 was
 talking
 about
 Trump's


sinking
 approval
 rating
 back
 when
 these


ICE
 issues
 were
 happening.
 The
 Epstein


files
 weren't
 being
 released.
 Then
 in


November,
 I
 brought
 this
 up
 again.


Trump's
 uh
 net
 approval
 rating
 hit
 13%.


And
 then
 same
 chart
 coming
 up
 now.
 He's


uh
 18%.


What's
 And
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people


like
 to
 use
 this
 term
 taco.
 Trump
 always


chicken
 out
 chickens
 out.
 I
 don't
 like


when
 people
 use
 that
 because
 I
 think


they're
 trying
 to
 goat
 him
 on.
 I
 think


he
 needs
 to
 react
 to
 these
 plummeting


ratings
 here.
 If
 you
 could
 play
 the


Tillis
 quote,
 Nick,


>> if
 I
 were
 in
 her
 position,
 I
 can't
 think


of
 any
 point
 in
 pride
 over
 the
 last


year.
 She's
 got
 to
 make
 her
 own
 decision


or
 the
 president
 does.
 But
 she
 has
 taken


this
 administration
 into
 the
 ground
 on


an
 issue
 that
 we
 should
 own.
 We
 should


own
 the
 issue
 of
 border
 security
 and


immigration.
 But
 they
 have
 destroyed


that
 for
 Republicans.
 Something
 that
 got


the
 president
 elected.
 They
 have


destroyed
 it
 through
 their
 incompetence.


David
 Miller
 is
 in
 the
 same
 boat.
 this


guy
 after
 doing
 the
 stupid
 comments
 he


made
 about
 Greenland
 getting
 the


president
 in
 a
 difficult
 circumstance
 is


one
 of
 the
 people
 that
 came
 out
 publicly


and
 said
 that
 this
 guy
 was
 a
 terrorist


before
 he
 had
 even
 talked
 with
 anybody


on
 the
 ground
 and
 that's
 clearly
 not
 the


case
 now.
 So
 I
 mean
 it's
 just
 I
 mean


Steven
 Miller
 never
 fails
 to
 live
 up
 to


my
 expectations
 of
 incompetence.


>> And
 here's
 Marowski
 uh
 with
 a
 similar


opinion
 another
 Republican.


>> Senator,
 do
 you
 have
 faith
 in
 Christine


Noam
 as
 DHS
 secretary?
 I
 I've
 already


made
 a
 statement
 on
 that.


>> Oh,
 I
 I
 wasn't
 there
 for
 it.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 said
 that
 I've
 lost
 confidence


in
 her.


>> Do
 you
 think
 that
 President
 Trump
 should


remove
 her
 from
 the
 position?
 Do
 you


think
 she
 should
 resign?


>> Obviously,
 up
 to
 the
 president.
 Um
 I


think
 we
 would
 be
 we
 would
 be
 better


served


with
 leadership.


>> At
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 Americans
 don't


like
 to
 see
 this
 violence.
 They
 don't


like
 cruelty.
 They
 don't
 like
 chaos.
 The


reason
 Trump
 lost
 to
 Biden,
 who's
 not
 a


very
 strong
 candidate,
 is
 because
 of
 the


general
 chaos
 people
 felt


with
 the
 immigrant
 ban
 the
 last
 time
 and


people
 do
 want
 to
 see
 the
 border
 closed


and
 that
 has
 had
 a
 great
 effect
 I
 think


on
 the
 country
 and
 I
 think
 that's


fantastic
 and
 he
 should
 take
 a
 victory


lap
 for
 that.
 But
 leadership
 starts
 at


the
 top.
 President
 Trump
 put
 Steven


Miller
 in
 charge
 of
 all
 this.
 Uh
 I
 think


he's
 a
 bad
 actor.
 I
 think
 these
 people


who
 he
 hired
 were
 picked
 strictly
 to
 do


lawfare
 and
 to
 do
 this
 kind
 of
 sadistic


violent
 behavior
 to
 feed
 a
 MAGA
 base


that's
 not
 going
 to
 keep
 Trump
 in
 office


and
 in
 fact
 going
 to
 cause
 him
 to
 lose


the
 second
 uh
 to
 lose
 the
 midterms.
 So


the
 easy
 solution
 which
 I
 brought
 up


here
 over
 and
 over
 again
 is
 if
 you
 want


to
 stop
 having
 people
 come
 into
 this


country,
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 why
 they're


coming
 to
 this
 country.
 They're
 coming


to
 this
 country
 because
 they
 want
 to


have
 a
 better
 life.
 That's
 why
 they're


coming
 here.
 And
 that's
 why
 they'll
 pay


a
 coyote
 10
 or
 20
 or
 $30,000
 and
 risk


their
 own
 safety
 coming
 across
 that


border
 where
 many
 people
 die
 and
 abused


and
 are
 abused.
 So
 if
 you
 want
 to
 stop


this,
 all
 you
 have
 to
 do
 is
 go
 to
 the


business
 owners
 and
 find
 them.
 And
 if


they
 keep
 hiring
 illegal
 aliens,
 you


keep
 finding
 them
 and
 you
 put
 them
 in


jail.
 But
 you
 don't
 see
 Steven
 Miller


doing
 that.
 Why?
 Well,
 because
 a
 lot
 of


those
 businesses
 are
 the
 voters
 who
 put


Trump
 in
 office.
 They're
 Republicans.


Yeah.
 Sure,
 there's
 Democrat
 owned


business
 owners
 as
 well,
 but
 you
 can


solve
 this
 whole
 problem
 without
 sending


mass
 agents
 in
 to
 beat
 the
 [ __ ]
 out
 of


people,
 to
 be
 violent,
 to
 provoke
 these


kind
 of
 reactions.
 And
 that
 doesn't


absolve
 people
 driving
 their
 cars
 into


the
 police.
 That's
 horrible
 and
 it's
 a


terrible
 tragedy.
 And
 these
 people,
 as


I've
 said
 three
 or
 four
 times,
 uh
 should


not
 go
 out
 and
 protest.
 But
 you
 could


solve
 this.
 If
 there
 are
 no
 job


opportunities
 for
 illegal
 aliens,
 they


will
 stop
 coming
 here.
 finally
 agree


with
 your
 point
 strongly,
 Freedberg,


that
 we
 should
 be
 compassionate
 to
 the


people
 who
 have
 been
 here
 10,
 20
 years


and
 paid
 their
 taxes.
 I've
 said
 this


here
 many
 times.
 They
 should
 be
 given
 a


path.
 America
 is
 a
 country
 built
 by


immigrants
 for
 immigrants,
 including
 the


three
 of
 you,
 my
 bestie
 immigrants.


>> And
 we
 all
 came
 here
 illegally
 or
 our


parents
 did


>> and
 we
 didn't
 seek
 into
 the
 country.


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.


>> Now,
 you
 kind
 of
 gave
 this
 diet
 trial.
 I


don't
 know
 why
 you've
 picked
 Steven


Miller
 as
 the
 vessel
 of
 your
 hatred.


It's
 like
 you've


>> No,
 it's
 not
 hatred.
 I
 based
 on


>> There's
 been
 a
 transference.
 There's


been
 a
 transference
 of
 your


>> trans
 just
 based
 on
 his
 TDS
 to
 Steven


Miller
 derangement
 syndrome
 or
 something


like
 that.


>> If
 he
 if
 his
 actions
 were
 if
 his
 actions


were
 kind
 and
 compassionate


>> if
 if
 his
 if
 he
 was
 compassionate


towards
 immigrants


and
 uh
 recognize
 the
 importance
 of


immigrants
 to
 this
 American
 story,
 I


would
 be
 fine
 with
 it.
 It's
 just
 based


on
 his
 behavior.
 David,
 I
 don't
 have


TDS.
 You
 can
 name
 call
 all
 you
 want.
 I'm


just
 basing
 it
 on
 your
 behavior.


>> You've
 decided
 to
 do
 this
 ad
 homonym


against
 him.
 And
 look,
 the
 big
 picture


is
 that
 threat
 is
 basing
 it
 on
 their
 I'm


basing
 it
 on
 their
 qualifications.


>> You're
 not
 really
 presenting
 You're
 not


really
 presenting
 evidence.
 You're


showing
 what
 other
 people
 think.
 You're


showing
 polling
 and
 then
 what
 a
 few


senators
 think.
 So
 basically,
 you're


trying
 to
 build
 a
 Hold
 on.
 You're
 Hold


on.
 Let
 me
 finish
 my
 point.
 You're


basically
 trying
 to
 build
 a
 case
 against


him
 by
 using
 the
 opinions
 and


declarations
 of
 other
 people
 rather
 than


actually
 presenting
 evidence
 and


building
 that
 case
 other
 than
 just
 a


name
 call
 and
 say
 that
 he's
 not


compassionate.
 The
 big
 picture
 is
 that
 I


would
 say
 that
 Steven
 Miller
 has
 been


more
 correct
 about
 immigration
 than
 you


have
 been
 over
 the
 last
 several
 years.


For
 years,
 you
 were
 denying
 that
 we
 had


an
 open
 border
 problem,
 did
 you
 not?


>> No.
 No.
 for
 one
 year
 when
 the
 spike
 went


up
 I
 said
 let's
 get
 the
 data
 on
 this


because
 it
 doesn't
 make
 sense
 that
 it


would
 triple
 year-over-year
 and
 then
 we


found
 out
 that
 it
 was
 in
 fact
 and
 with


the
 new
 information
 I
 changed
 my
 opinion


and
 said
 yeah
 this
 is
 obviously


happening


that
 was
 literally
 what
 happened


>> well
 I
 don't
 know
 I
 mean
 during
 the


buying
 years
 I
 remember
 we
 had
 a
 bunch


of
 debates
 about
 this
 and
 you
 were


saying


>> my
 position
 was
 let's
 see
 the
 data
 cuz


the
 data
 if
 you
 look
 I
 I I
 played
 this


chart
 on
 the
 podcast
 many
 times
 we


showed
 like
 the
 last
 four
 years
 and
 then


there
 was
 a
 spike
 and
 I
 said
 this


doesn't
 make
 any
 sense
 How
 did
 this


spike
 happen?
 It's
 just
 my
 opinion.
 You


don't
 have
 to
 have
 a
 you
 can
 have
 a


difference
 of
 opinion.


>> Let
 me
 go
 back
 to
 the
 origin
 of
 the


chaos
 in
 Minnesota.
 You
 don't
 see
 this


happening
 in
 other
 states.
 And
 I
 just


want
 to
 point
 out
 one
 of
 the
 major


reasons
 why.
 So
 in
 other
 states,
 you


know,
 take
 your
 pick.
 When
 you
 have
 an


illegal
 alien
 and
 they
 get
 arrested,


they
 get
 handed
 over
 to
 ICE
 or
 Border


Patrol
 for
 deportation.
 That's
 what's


happening
 in
 Minnesota.
 the
 politicians


have
 given
 an
 instruction
 not
 to
 do


that.
 So,
 literally,
 you
 have
 criminals,


people
 who've
 been
 arrested.
 There's
 a


case
 that
 was
 just
 um
 posted
 today
 of
 an


illegal
 alien
 in
 Minneapolis
 who
 killed


an
 innocent
 mother
 and
 severely
 injured


two
 others
 backto
 back
 in
 uh
 drunk


driving
 crashes.
 He
 did
 not
 have
 a
 valid


driver's
 license,
 did
 not
 have


insurance.
 He
 was
 arrested
 for
 vehicular


homicide.
 ICE
 asked
 him
 to
 be
 turned


over
 to
 them
 and
 the
 authorities
 in


Minneapolis
 refused
 to
 do
 that
 and
 they


eventually
 released
 him.
 So
 that
 puts


ICE
 in
 the
 position
 of
 having
 to
 go
 out


and
 find
 these
 guys
 and
 arrest
 them.


That's
 how
 all
 these
 operations
 started.


And
 you
 make
 it
 sound
 like
 these
 guys


are
 the
 Gestapo
 and
 they
 just
 randomly


round
 people
 up.
 That's
 not
 what's


happening.
 They
 have
 arrest
 warrants


with
 the
 names
 of
 specific
 people
 that


they're
 going
 after.
 There
 are
 arrest


warrants,
 but
 there
 were
 also
 Steven


Miller
 told
 them
 to
 just
 go
 round
 people


up
 at
 specific
 locations.
 So,


>> there
 is
 that
 as
 well.
 And
 they've
 been


trying
 to
 hit
 numbers
 that
 they
 just


can't
 possibly
 hit.
 You
 have
 to
 ask


yourself


>> why
 didn't
 we
 have
 you
 have
 to
 ask


yourself,
 I
 think,
 Sax,
 why
 didn't
 we


have
 this
 kind
 of
 violence
 and
 unmarked


people,
 breaking
 people's
 rights
 under


Obama
 who
 did
 far
 more?


>> I'll
 tell
 you
 why.
 You
 want
 to
 know
 why?


Because
 Obama
 said
 that
 we
 should


deport.
 Ultimately,
 our
 nation,
 like
 all


nations,
 has
 the
 right
 and
 obligation
 to


control
 its
 borders
 and
 set
 laws
 for


residency
 and
 citizenship.
 And
 no
 matter


how
 decent
 they
 are,
 no matter
 their


reasons.
 The
 11
 million
 who
 broke
 these


laws
 should
 be
 held
 accountable.


>> I'm
 saying
 he
 was
 able
 to
 do
 it
 without


sending
 masked
 agents
 in
 to
 beat
 the


>> No,
 the
 Democratic
 party
 changed.
 That's


what
 happened
 15
 years
 ago.
 the
 position


that
 Obama
 Can
 I
 just
 talking
 about
 the


policing?
 You
 ask
 me
 a
 question.
 Why


wasn't
 the
 policeing?
 Why
 didn't
 this


happen
 under
 Obama?
 Let
 me
 tell
 you
 the


reason
 why
 the
 policing
 happen
 years


ago.
 The
 Democrat
 party
 was
 still


somewhat
 rational
 on
 this
 issue
 and
 it


was
 basically
 a
 bipartisan
 position
 to


support
 deportations
 of
 illegal
 aliens


and
 not
 to
 have
 an
 open
 border.
 The


Democrat
 party
 changed
 their
 point
 of


view
 on
 this
 issue.
 Now,


>> that's
 not
 what
 I'm
 talking
 about


policing.


>> Let
 me
 finish
 my
 point.
 Tom
 Hman
 has


said
 over
 and
 over
 again,
 we
 don't
 want


to
 go
 out
 on
 the
 street.
 It's
 dangerous.


They
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 put
 in
 this


position.
 ICSE
 has
 an
 incredibly


dangerous
 job
 to
 do.
 Border
 Patrol
 has


an
 incredibly
 dangerous
 job
 to
 do.
 By


the
 way,
 the
 reason
 why
 they
 wear
 masks


is
 because
 they're
 getting
 doxed
 by


these
 groups
 who
 are
 organizing
 with


each
 other
 on
 signal
 and
 they're
 being


followed
 around.
 They're
 being
 stalked.


They're
 being
 chased
 to
 their
 hotels
 and


these
 guys
 follow
 them
 around.
 They


block
 their
 cars
 by
 um
 interposing


vehicles.
 They're
 interfering
 in
 in


official
 operations.
 They're
 interfering


with
 arrest
 and
 they're
 getting
 in


physical
 altercations
 with
 them.
 This
 is


very
 dangerous
 for
 eyes.
 They
 don't
 want


to
 be
 in
 this
 position.
 But
 the
 reason


why
 all
 of
 this
 is
 happening
 is
 because


Tim
 Waltz
 and
 Jacob
 Fry
 and
 the
 rest
 of


these
 guys,
 Lieutenant
 Governor,
 they


are
 saying,
 "Do
 not
 cooperate
 with
 ICE.


Do
 not
 cooperate
 with
 the
 border


patrol."
 Telling
 local
 authorities
 in


Minnesota,
 when
 you
 arrest
 an
 illegal


alien,
 do
 not
 turn
 them
 over
 to
 ICE.


It's
 better
 to
 release
 them.
 These


people
 are
 such
 anti-ICE
 zealots
 that


they
 would
 rather
 release
 a
 killer
 onto


the
 street
 than
 keep
 them
 in
 jail
 where


they
 can
 be
 turned
 over
 to
 ICE.
 And


that's
 the
 whole
 reason
 why
 they
 don't


want
 to
 keep
 them
 in
 jail
 is
 because


that
 would
 create
 a
 central
 repository,


if
 you
 will,
 for
 ICE
 to
 go
 collect
 all


these
 illegal
 aliens.
 Last
 year
 there


was
 something
 like
 470
 convicts,
 okay?


Illegal
 aliens,
 criminals.
 And
 I'm
 not


talking
 about
 that
 their
 crime
 wasn't


breaking
 into
 the
 country.
 I'm
 talking


about
 subsequent
 crimes
 that
 were


released


in
 Minnesota
 so
 they
 they
 cannot
 be


rounded
 up
 by
 ICE
 and
 deported.
 These


people
 are
 zealots
 and
 that
 is
 the


source
 of
 the
 problem.
 And
 then
 on
 top


of
 that,
 you've
 got
 rhetoric
 by
 people


like
 Tim
 Walls
 and
 the
 lieutenant


governor
 calling
 ICE
 and
 Border
 Patrol


agents
 who
 are
 just
 trying
 to
 do
 their


jobs
 the
 Gestapo
 and
 Nazis
 and
 riing


people
 up.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 people
 like


Alex
 Pretty
 or
 Renee
 Good,
 they're


victims
 of
 this
 type
 of
 rhetoric.
 These


are
 left-wing
 activists
 who
 are
 in
 this


leftwing
 echo
 chamber
 and
 they're


baronating
 in
 all
 this
 rhetoric
 that's


portraying
 law
 enforcement
 officials
 as


Nazis
 and
 they're
 embibing
 this


constantly
 to
 the
 point
 where
 they're


full
 of
 rage
 and
 anger.
 You
 see
 that


video
 of
 Alex
 Pretty
 attacking
 Border


Patrol.
 This
 is
 two
 weeks
 before
 he
 gets


killed.
 He's
 kicking
 the
 car.
 He's
 like


foaming
 at
 the
 mouth.
 He's
 in
 some
 sort


of
 rage.
 This
 is
 someone
 who's


emotionally
 disturbed
 and
 he's
 got
 a
 a


gun
 on
 his
 waistband,
 which
 look,
 every


gun
 owner
 knows
 that
 you
 have
 to
 be


exceedingly
 careful
 if
 you
 are
 carrying


a
 weapon
 and
 then
 you
 are
 dealing
 with


law
 enforcement.
 The
 last
 thing
 you
 want


to
 do
 is
 go
 out
 looking
 for
 an


altercation
 with
 them,
 which
 is
 what
 he


did.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 think
 it's


completely
 tragic
 that
 the
 two
 of
 them


were
 killed.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 see
 that


happen.
 But
 again,
 they
 are
 victims
 of


this
 political
 environment,
 this
 chaos


that's
 being
 whipped
 up
 by
 the
 elected


officials
 in
 Minnesota.
 This
 would
 not


be
 happening
 if
 they
 simply
 turned
 over


the
 illegal
 aliens
 in
 their
 custody
 to


ICE
 and
 Border
 Patrol,
 which
 is
 all
 that


they're
 asking
 for.


>> I've
 said
 on
 this
 podcast
 like
 many


times,
 but
 none
 of
 you
 will
 respond
 to


it.
 Why
 are
 they
 doing
 this
 instead
 of


just
 finding
 the
 business
 owners?


Wouldn't
 that
 be
 a
 better
 policy?
 And


you're
 in
 the
 White
 House,
 you're
 around


these
 people.
 Why
 don't
 you
 tell
 them


why
 don't
 we
 do
 that?
 Why
 don't
 we
 just


give
 fines
 to
 business
 owners
 who
 hire


illegals
 and
 stop
 the
 incentive
 to
 come


here?


>> How
 do
 you
 know
 that
 they
 hired


illegals?
 How
 would
 you
 know
 that?
 And


if
 you
 know
 that,
 then
 you
 know
 the


individual.


>> It's
 super
 simple.
 You
 would
 just
 go
 do


uh
 a
 little
 investigation.
 You
 go
 to
 the


car
 wash,
 you
 videotape
 it
 like
 any


other
 detective
 or
 any
 other
 federal


agent
 or
 a
 local
 police
 officer
 would,


and
 then
 you
 track
 those
 people
 down.


You
 very
 quietly
 go
 pick
 one
 or
 two
 of


them
 up
 on
 the
 way
 home.
 You
 ask
 them


for
 their
 papers
 or
 you
 go
 to
 the
 owner


and
 say,
 "Hey,
 we
 have
 these
 six
 people.


Here's
 their
 pictures.
 Here's
 the


pictures
 of
 the
 six
 people.
 Show
 us


their
 papers.
 Show
 us
 their
 social


security
 number."
 That's
 all
 you
 have
 to


do.
 Freeberg,


>> here's
 my
 here's
 my
 here's
 my
 proposal.


Okay,
 Jacob,
 you
 may
 have
 a
 point
 there,


Jacob.
 You
 may
 have
 a
 point,
 but
 I'm
 not


sure


>> that
 it's
 good
 enough
 in
 the
 case
 of
 an


illegal
 alien
 who's
 already
 been
 in
 this


country
 committing
 crimes.
 Okay.
 Yeah.


So,
 if
 you
 have
 if
 you
 hold
 on,
 if
 you


have
 a
 drunk
 driver


>> who
 has
 killed
 people
 through
 drunk


driving
 and
 they're
 they're
 captured,
 I


think
 they
 should
 be
 turned
 over
 and


deported
 immediately.


>> But
 if
 you
 want
 to
 do
 big
 numbers,
 like


big
 numbers,
 you
 could
 just
 go
 to
 a


farm,
 you
 could
 go
 to
 a
 car
 wash,
 you


could
 go
 to
 a
 restaurant,
 you
 take


pictures
 of
 everybody
 coming
 in
 and
 out


for
 their
 shift,
 you
 go
 to
 the
 business


owner
 and
 say,
 "We
 have
 these
 people.


They
 can
 you
 show
 us
 their
 uh
 paychecks


and
 their
 pay
 stubs?"


>> All
 right.
 So,
 we'll
 agree
 to
 disagree


on
 some
 of
 this
 and
 uh
 we'll
 agree
 that


this
 is
 a
 tragedy
 and
 that
 we
 need


leadership
 to
 calm
 these
 things
 down.
 Uh


and
 we
 need
 to
 agree
 on
 a
 very


reasonable
 immigration
 policy
 which
 is


not
 what
 we
 have
 right
 now
 in
 my


opinion.
 All
 right.
 Claudebot
 has
 gone


viral
 overnight.
 I
 have
 been
 claed.
 I


have
 been
 one
 claude.
 I
 am
 all
 in
 on


this.
 Um
 this
 is
 an
 open-source
 project


created
 by
 a
 gentleman
 named
 Peter


Steinberger.
 He's
 an
 Austrian
 developer


and
 entrepreneur.


So,
 what
 is
 it?
 It's
 uh
 basically
 an


open-source
 personal
 assistant.
 Uh
 think


like
 Siri
 or
 maybe
 Jarvis.
 Have
 any
 of


you
 guys
 used
 it
 yet?
 Has
 anybody


installed
 it
 yet?


>> I
 did.
 I
 spent
 15
 minutes
 and
 I
 saved


15%
 on
 my
 car
 insurance.


>> Are
 you
 joking?
 Sure.
 You
 installed
 it


and
 then
 asked
 it
 to
 go.


>> You
 know what's
 so
 funny,
 Nick?
 I
 posted


this.
 The
 number
 of
 people
 that
 didn't


understand
 that
 that
 was
 a
 joke.


>> No,
 I
 understand
 it's
 a
 joke.
 Yeah,


>> I
 know
 you
 did.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> But
 there
 was
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 that


were
 like,
 "Really?
 How
 did
 you
 do
 it?


Can
 I
 do
 it?"
 And
 then
 some
 people
 were


like, "Wait,
 only
 15%."
 And
 other
 people


were
 like, "Wait,
 you
 set
 it
 up


yourself.
 You
 didn't
 have
 somebody
 help


you."


>> This
 is
 the
 great
 This
 is
 This
 is


literally
 the
 greatest
 thing
 ever.
 Have


you
 installed
 it
 yet,
 Freedberg?


>> No,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 give


>> Okay.


>> an
 open
 source
 tool
 access
 to
 all
 my


emails
 and
 messages.


>> Have
 you
 done
 it
 yet?


>> No,
 because
 I'm
 concerned
 about
 the


security
 issues.
 But
 I
 want
 to
 I
 want
 to


do
 it,
 but
 I'm
 concerned
 about
 the


security.


>> I've
 spent
 the
 last
 72
 hours
 doing
 this.


I'm
 going
 to
 explain
 to
 you
 what
 we
 did


at
 the
 company.
 It's
 mind-blowing.
 Okay,


so
 it
 is
 basically
 think
 like
 an
 open-


source
 Siri
 or
 Jarvis,
 right?
 You
 get


into
 an
 interface
 and
 you
 can
 talk
 to
 a


virtual
 assistant
 and
 it
 does
 things
 for


you
 just
 like
 chat
 GPT
 or
 XAI
 might.
 But


the
 way
 it
 works
 is
 you
 kind
 of
 load
 a


virtual
 machine
 if
 you
 know
 what
 that
 is


or
 you
 can
 put
 it
 on
 your
 Mac
 Mini.
 You


run
 this
 like
 a
 server.
 Then
 you
 start


authenticating
 it
 with
 your
 services.


So,
 Gmail,
 Notion,
 Slack,
 WhatsApp,


maybe
 even
 your
 password
 manager.
 Super


dangerous.
 Nobody
 like
 Claude
 or
 XAI
 or


Microsoft
 would
 ever
 allow
 you
 to
 do


this
 because
 it's
 so
 dangerous,


obviously.


>> But
 we
 did
 this
 and
 we
 put
 it
 to
 work.


Here's
 what
 we
 did.
 I
 created
 a
 virtual


podcast
 producer
 and
 we
 made
 this


persona


and
 we
 created
 a
 new
 Gmail
 account,


Sachs,
 a
 new
 notion
 account,
 a
 new


WhatsApp
 account,
 everything.
 We
 created


like
 basically
 an
 a
 virtual
 employee.
 We


put
 it
 together
 and
 we
 made
 it
 the


producer
 for
 my
 new
 This
 Week
 in
 AI


podcast.
 There's
 a
 little
 plug
 in
 there


for
 it.
 So,
 we
 had
 it
 start
 doing


research
 on
 guests.
 So,
 we
 said,
 "Hey,


research
 guests,
 right?"
 just
 like
 you


can
 do
 in
 an
 LLM.
 Then
 we
 connected
 it


to
 um
 the
 existing
 feeds
 like
 the


podcast
 feeds
 and
 the
 database
 of
 like


people
 we've
 had
 on
 the
 show
 and
 like


who's
 booked.
 Then
 we
 said
 make
 a
 CRM


Sachs
 for
 all
 potential
 guests
 and


suggest
 other
 guests
 and
 it
 vibe
 coded
 a


CRM
 for
 itself.


>> Can
 you
 show
 this?


>> I
 said
 hey
 do
 some
 research
 on
 this.


Right.
 So
 then
 we
 start
 a
 thread
 with
 it


with
 the
 actual
 producer
 Oliver
 who's


working
 on
 this.
 So
 I
 said,
 "Do
 this


guest
 research."
 It
 did
 all
 this
 guest


research.
 Now,
 this
 is
 as
 good
 as
 like


Nick
 or
 Lisa
 would
 do
 at
 a
 first
 pass,


but
 it
 did
 it
 instantly.
 And
 then
 I
 made


a
 prompt
 for
 it
 to
 like,
 and
 I
 was
 using


this
 prompt,
 by
 the
 way,
 David,
 when
 we


were
 in
 Davos
 for
 our
 guests.
 And
 so


this
 like
 gets
 the
 company's
 name,
 the


founder
 information,
 you
 know,
 look
 for


their
 competitors,
 all
 the
 stuff
 that
 a


producer
 would
 do
 over
 a
 day
 or
 two.
 Do


a
 timeline,
 give
 suggested
 questions,


etc.
 So
 I
 teach
 it
 this.
 So,
 here's


producer
 X
 and
 it
 says,
 "Got
 it.
 That's


what
 uh
 that's
 a
 great
 guest
 research."


And
 I
 said, "Okay,
 do
 the
 guest
 research


on
 this
 person."
 It
 comes
 back
 with


that.
 And
 it
 gave
 me
 its
 media


appearances,
 all
 the
 stuff
 I
 would
 want


to
 do
 for
 research.
 Then
 I
 said,
 "Um,


uh,
 I
 think
 this
 would
 be


>> You're
 interacting
 with
 it
 like
 an


agent."
 So,
 how
 is
 it
 different
 than
 an


agent?


>> Watch.
 Okay,
 we're
 getting
 to
 it.
 So,


then
 I
 said,
 um,
 producer
 X,
 email
 Alex


and
 let
 him
 know
 that
 I
 want
 to
 have
 him


on
 this
 weekend
 in
 AI.
 CC
 me
 and
 CC


Oliver.
 And
 it
 says,
 uh,
 I
 couldn't


verify
 the
 email,
 but
 I'm
 going
 to
 try


this
 one.
 And
 it
 wrote
 this
 email.
 It


sent
 the
 email.
 Then
 after
 it
 sent
 it,


>> did
 he
 respond?


>> So
 here's
 the
 email
 to
 the
 guest.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> Hey,
 Alexis


wanted
 me
 to
 reach
 out.
 He'd
 love
 to


have
 you
 on
 this
 weekend
 to
 discuss


ExoLabs,
 your
 work
 on
 distributed


inference
 on
 the
 recent
 he
 like
 did
 this


like
 little
 thing.
 Let
 me
 know
 if
 you'd


be
 interested.


>> So
 then


>> it's
 [ __ ]
 crazy.
 He
 says,


>> this
 guy
 says,
 "Sounds
 great.
 I'll
 be
 in


touch."


>> Then
 I
 said,
 "Here's
 what
 I
 want
 you
 to


do.
 I
 want
 you,"
 and
 we
 created
 a
 group


called
 replicants.
 So
 now
 we've
 made


five
 replicants
 at
 the
 company.
 And


today
 is
 like
 replicant
 day
 or
 replicant


week.
 So
 I
 told
 it
 every
 time
 you
 do


work
 for
 me
 in
 the
 replicant
 room,
 say


what
 you
 did
 and
 then
 also
 put
 it
 on


your
 calendar.
 So
 now
 it's
 putting
 on


its
 calendar
 what
 it
 did
 in
 timestamps.


So
 he
 said
 I
 did
 some
 guest
 research


here
 and
 then
 yesterday
 I
 did
 this


booking
 report
 and
 that
 I'm
 doing
 this


AI
 around
 it
 that
 I'm
 doing
 this


>> and
 then
 I
 set
 up
 a
 and
 then
 producer


lawn
 had
 it
 set
 up
 a
 ticker
 because
 we


did
 this
 email
 ticker
 and
 did
 all
 that


work


>> and
 the
 crazy
 thing
 is
 you
 can
 start


talking
 to
 it
 directly
 so
 I
 can
 have
 a


direct
 conversation
 with
 producer
 X
 and


it
 learns
 and
 now
 it
 knows
 everything.


So
 we
 started
 one
 to
 be
 an
 SDR
 and
 then


we
 are
 giving
 it
 access
 to
 our
 CRM


there.
 But
 it
 built
 its
 own
 CRM,
 David.


It's
 building
 its
 own
 SAS
 tools
 to
 solve


its
 problems.
 Every
 time
 you
 add
 it
 to


something,
 it
 gets
 smarter.
 So
 now
 we've


we're
 making
 a
 LinkedIn
 for
 this


persona.


>> The
 LinkedIn
 is
 going
 to
 start
 adding


people.
 People
 don't
 know
 that
 these


aren't
 humans.


>> Yeah,


>> it's
 insane.


>> All right,
 let
 me
 give
 you
 a
 few


thoughts.
 So,
 I
 was
 paying
 close


attention
 to
 the
 whole
 Claudebot


freakout,
 you
 know,
 over
 the
 weekend.


And,
 you
 know,
 again,
 I
 wanted
 to
 set
 it


up
 really
 badly,
 but
 I
 was
 too
 afraid
 of


the
 security
 issues
 to
 do
 it,
 but
 I
 was


watching
 everyone
 else
 do
 it.
 And
 look,


I
 think
 the
 takeaways
 for
 me
 are
 number


one
 that
 this
 will
 be
 the
 year
 of
 the


rise
 of
 the
 personal
 AI
 assistant.
 Until


now,
 AI
 has
 mainly
 come
 in
 the
 form


factor
 of
 a
 chatbot
 and
 it's
 been
 used


as
 a
 research
 tool.
 Some
 people
 have


>> search.
 Yeah,


>> it's
 better
 search.
 There's
 kind
 of
 this


niche
 case
 of,
 you
 know,
 fantasy
 chat


bots
 where
 people
 actually
 like
 somehow


talking
 to
 a
 chatbot,
 but
 really
 it's


about
 better
 web
 search
 and
 it's
 about


research.
 Now,
 we're
 moving
 to
 a


completely
 different
 form
 factor,
 which


is
 again
 this
 AI
 assistant
 that's
 an


agent
 that
 can
 do
 things
 for
 you
 and


it's
 going
 to
 get
 better
 and
 better
 at


doing
 different
 tasks
 for
 you.


Everyone's
 going
 to
 have
 this
 amazing
 AI


agent.
 Now,
 you
 know
 who
 who
 is
 the


beneficiary
 of
 this
 market
 opportunity?


I
 mean
 there's
 obviously
 going
 to
 be


some
 startups
 like
 the
 guy
 who's
 doing


Claudebot
 which
 I
 guess
 he
 renamed
 it


was
 it
 moldbot
 or


>> it's
 called
 Maltbot
 now
 because
 Claude


got
 upset


>> right
 so
 in
 any
 event
 it's
 Maltbot
 now


but
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 tremendous


opportunity
 for
 Google
 because
 the


question
 is
 who
 has
 your
 data
 Google
 has


all
 my
 email
 my
 calendar
 my
 documents


which
 is
 exactly
 the
 stuff
 that
 I
 would


want
 to
 integrate
 with
 Cloudbot
 if
 I


believed
 it
 was
 safe
 obviously
 I've


already
 made
 the
 determination
 that


Google
 is
 safe
 because
 they
 already
 have


all
 my
 data
 so
 I
 think
 Google
 is
 in
 a


tremendous


position
 to
 offer
 a
 personal
 AI


assistant
 that's
 connected
 with
 your


email
 and
 calendar
 for
 those
 of
 us
 who


are
 using
 G
 Suite
 and
 so
 on.
 Obviously,


there'll
 be
 opportunities
 for
 other


companies
 as
 well,
 but
 I
 think
 this
 is


going
 to
 be
 such
 a
 big
 product
 that
 it


may
 become
 the
 dominant
 form
 factor
 of


AI,
 meaning
 more
 popular
 than
 the
 the


sort
 of
 researchoriented
 chatbot.


Speaking
 from
 the
 policy
 point
 of
 view,


I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 change
 the
 policy


debate
 around
 AI
 because
 so
 much
 of
 the


policy
 debate
 over
 AI
 is
 about
 fighting


the
 last
 set
 of
 battles
 around
 social


media


>> question
 and
 answer
 modality.


>> It's
 sort
 of
 treating
 AI
 as
 like
 a
 form


of
 social
 media.
 I
 mean,
 I
 hear
 policy


makers
 say
 all
 the
 time,
 what
 are
 you


going
 to
 do
 to
 protect
 kids
 against


predators?
 And
 it's
 like,
 well,
 wait,


what
 predators
 are
 you
 talking
 about?


This
 is
 not
 social
 media,
 right?
 I
 mean,


I
 understand
 if
 you
 want
 to
 protect
 kids


against,
 I
 don't
 know,
 a
 fantasy
 chatbot


that's
 recommending
 they
 do
 bad
 things,


but
 it's
 just
 it's
 very
 different,


right?
 This
 is
 just
 a
 completely


different
 modality.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 the


rise
 of
 agents
 will
 make
 that
 clear
 that


we're
 dealing
 with
 something
 that's
 not


social
 media.
 Maybe
 there's
 some


analogies
 to
 the
 previous
 set
 of
 policy


battles
 that
 were
 fought
 over
 social


media,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 quite
 different.


So,
 I
 think
 Claudebot
 is
 a
 breakthrough.


I
 think
 it's
 a
 really
 interesting
 proof


of
 concept
 and
 we'll
 also
 have
 to
 see


exactly
 who
 who
 the
 big
 winners
 are


here.


>> I
 think
 what's
 interesting
 is
 that
 if
 I


said
 to
 you,
 hey,
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 an


AI
 personal
 assistant.
 You
 would
 have


some
 point
 of
 view
 in
 your
 mind
 on
 what


that
 means.
 It's
 like,
 oh,
 it
 can,
 you


know,
 change
 my
 calendar,


tell
 me
 about
 my
 travel,
 read
 my
 email


for
 me,
 summarize
 that
 that
 kind
 of


stuff.
 But
 what
 I
 think
 people
 don't


realize,
 it's
 almost
 like
 the
 first
 time


you
 use
 FSD
 in
 your
 Tesla
 or
 the
 first


time
 you
 used
 an
 iPhone,
 you
 realize


that
 it's
 so
 much
 more
 that
 it
 widens


the
 aperture
 of
 what's
 possible
 that


it's
 not
 just
 the
 assistant
 in
 the
 way


that
 you
 might
 otherwise
 be
 thinking


about
 it,
 but
 it's
 like
 this
 super


worker.
 And
 the
 super
 worker,
 like
 to


Jal's
 point,
 it
 it
 does
 both
 scheduling,


calendaring,
 ideation,
 knowledge
 work,


creates
 new
 code,
 creates
 CRM
 tools,


books
 your
 travel,
 it
 does
 everything.


And
 then
 if
 you
 start
 thinking
 about


having
 an
 army
 of
 super
 workers,
 you're


like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 what's
 possible?"
 And


now
 think
 about
 what
 Elon's
 doing.


Yesterday,
 Elon
 shut
 down
 the
 Model
 S


and
 Model
 X
 production
 lines
 in
 Fremont.


>> And
 by
 the
 way,
 you
 know,
 a
 year
 ago,


I'd
 never
 owned
 a
 Tesla.
 And
 I
 was
 so


blown
 away
 with
 FSD
 that
 in
 the
 last


week,
 we
 bought
 two
 more
 Model
 X's.
 So


now
 everyone
 in
 my
 family,
 we're
 all
 on


Tesla
 because
 the
 experience
 is
 so
 good.


But
 they're
 shutting
 down
 the
 Model
 S,


Model
 X
 lines
 to
 make
 Optimus.
 So
 if


you've
 got
 the
 same
 thing
 that
 Jal's


talking
 about
 and
 experiencing,
 but


you've
 actually
 got
 it
 in
 physical
 form


in
 addition
 to
 digital
 form,
 that's
 the


future
 where
 everyone
 has
 a
 super


workforce
 and
 you
 put
 two
 optimists
 in


your
 garage
 and
 they
 build
 and
 run
 a


business
 for
 you
 and
 then
 everyone


becomes
 an
 entrepreneur.


>> What
 was
 my
 prediction,
 Jason?
 What
 of


my
 prediction?


>> Oh,
 that
 they
 would
 merge
 all
 these


companies
 and
 then
 this
 week


>> it's
 happening.


>> It's
 happening
 apparently.
 Um
 or
 I


shouldn't
 say
 it's
 happening.
 We
 don't


know
 it's
 happening,
 but
 beep


>> boop.


Between
 this
 and
 my
 copper
 prediction,


>> I'm
 about
 to
 retire.


>> You
 know,
 copper's
 up
 26%
 in
 a
 month.


>> What
 is
 that?
 Is
 an
 annualized.


>> Check
 this
 out.
 S


>> I
 we
 invited
 somebody
 from
 Craft


Ventures
 on
 and
 I
 forgot
 who's
 from


Craft
 Ventures
 who's
 going to
 be
 on
 this


week
 in
 AI.
 So,
 I
 said,
 "Can
 you
 tell
 me


who's
 doing
 it?"
 And
 it
 said,
 "Oh,
 I


couldn't
 find
 it."
 I
 said, "Oh,
 it's
 in


the
 notion
 database."
 So,
 it
 goes
 and
 it


found
 it.
 Oh,
 Mike
 Robinson
 from
 Craft


Ventures
 is
 on
 February
 24th.
 And
 then


there's
 also
 Brian
 from
 Craft
 or


whatever.
 And
 he
 was
 on
 a
 different


liquidity
 round
 table.
 And
 I
 said,
 "Hey,


can
 you
 email
 Mike
 and
 I
 want
 to
 do
 a


pre-show
 call
 with
 him?"
 Guessed
 his


email,
 sent
 it.
 I
 said,
 "C
 Heidi,
 I


haven't
 given
 him an
 access
 to
 my


stuff."
 And
 it
 said,
 "Oh,
 do
 you
 want
 to


get
 his
 top
 three
 times,
 all
 this


stuff?"
 It's
 crazy
 what's
 going
 on
 here,


folks.
 I
 would
 say
 out
 of
 50
 hours
 a


producer
 does
 a
 week,
 this
 does
 40
 of


them.
 And
 of
 what
 an
 SDR
 does,
 this
 does


95%.


This
 is
 going
 to
 be
 crazy
 because
 it


keeps
 learning.
 Now,
 your
 API
 bill
 is


going to
 be
 nuts.
 The
 first
 day
 we
 did


this,
 we
 hit
 like
 a
 $100.
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 like
 $1,000
 a
 day
 in
 API


calls.
 So,
 my
 team's
 like,
 "Hey,
 this
 is


a
 lot
 of
 API
 calls
 because
 people
 are


going
 crazy
 inside
 Slack
 and
 making
 all


of
 these
 agents."


>> Good
 news,
 Kimmy
 2.5.
 Yeah.


>> Uh
 we
 are
 ordering
 Mac
 um
 studios,
 the


really
 powerful
 studios
 with
 like
 max


memory
 on
 and
 they're
 putting
 Kimmy.
 Is


that
 the
 new
 open
 source
 one?


>> Yeah,
 we're
 putting
 Kimmy
 on
 them.
 We're


going
 to
 have
 free


free
 for
 and
 then
 it
 according
 to
 people


online
 like
 95%
 of
 all
 these
 queries
 can


be
 done
 for
 free
 with
 Kimmy.


>> You'll
 save
 90%.


>> It's
 crazy.


>> It's
 really
 crazy.


>> This
 is
 independent
 by
 the
 way
 of


whatever
 LLM
 you
 want
 to
 use.
 You
 can


swap
 out
 LLMs.
 You
 could
 route
 it
 to


different
 LLMs.
 You
 can
 do
 whatever
 you


want
 with
 it.
 I
 tried
 to
 have
 it
 create


Reddit
 accounts
 for
 me.
 Like,
 I
 want
 a


Reddit
 account
 to
 go
 do
 research.
 And


it's
 like,
 I
 can't
 do
 that.
 It's
 against


the
 term
 of
 service.
 I
 don't
 think


people
 understand
 how
 important
 this


Kimmy
 K2.5
 moment
 is.


>> Wait,
 what
 is
 Kimmy
 K2?


>> Just
 to
 set
 some
 context,
 right?
 So,
 I


think
 the
 last
 few
 years
 we've
 all
 kind


of
 lived
 in
 a
 world
 of
 what
 I
 would
 call


blackbox
 AI,
 meaning
 you
 go
 to
 your


favorite
 chatbot,
 basically,
 you
 put
 in


a
 prompt
 and
 you
 press
 enter,
 right?
 And


all
 of
 those
 things
 go
 to
 proprietary


models
 and
 they're
 excellent.
 OpenAI
 has


some,
 Anthropic
 has
 some,
 Google
 has


some,
 and
 they
 all
 give
 you
 back
 an


answer.
 Super
 powerful.
 But
 the


important
 thing
 that
 we
 don't
 know
 to


care
 about
 right
 now
 is
 that
 all
 of
 that


stuff
 is
 gated.
 What
 does
 that
 mean?
 You


don't
 own
 the
 keys.
 You
 don't
 own
 the


blueprints.
 You
 have
 no
 idea
 what's


actually
 going
 on.
 And
 what
 Claudebot


demonstrated
 this
 week
 is
 you're
 one


terms
 of
 service
 update
 away
 from


everything
 breaking,
 right?
 Because
 at


one
 point,
 Anthropic
 didn't
 like
 what


was
 going
 on
 and
 they
 said,
 "No,
 this
 is


not
 allowed."
 So,


we've
 talked
 about
 this
 battle
 between


open
 source
 and
 closed
 source.
 So
 all
 of


the
 models
 that
 that
 have
 been
 winning,


the
 blackbox
 models
 are
 closed
 source


models.
 But
 open
 source
 is
 important


because
 it's
 transparent.
 It
 gives


everybody
 their
 own
 sovereignty
 whether


you're
 a
 company
 and
 frankly
 really
 more


importantly
 whether
 you're
 a
 country.
 It


gives
 you
 control
 of
 your
 own
 speed.
 It


gives
 you
 a
 lot
 of
 execution
 control.


You
 can
 audit
 the
 weights
 of
 the
 models.


It
 allows
 you
 to
 host
 it
 on
 your
 own


hardware.
 And
 the
 most
 important
 thing


is
 the
 data
 never
 leaves
 your
 control.


So
 that's
 why
 open
 source
 was
 really


important,
 but
 it
 was
 always
 kind
 of


like
 an
 underdog
 and
 it
 wasn't


particularly
 good.
 So
 this
 week
 you
 wake


up,
 you
 go
 to
 the
 office
 and
 Kim
 K
 2.5


is
 important.
 So
 this
 is
 why
 it's
 so


important
 because
 it
 was
 incredibly


profound.
 It's
 a
 trillion
 parameter


mixture
 of
 expert
 model.


When
 you
 farm
 out
 work,
 the
 proprietary


models
 keep
 that
 agentic
 layer
 kind
 of


secret.


Kimmy
 Cape
 2.5
 was
 like
 okay
 look
 here's


this
 thing
 called
 agent
 swarm
 it's
 a


technology
 that
 we
 built
 that's
 also
 now


public
 and
 it
 allows
 you
 to
 create
 all


you
 know
 100
 sub
 aents
 and
 what
 that


allows
 you
 to
 do
 is
 basically
 solve
 any


complicated


multi-step
 problem
 in
 parallel
 so
 I


think
 this
 is
 the
 moment
 now
 if
 I
 had
 to


make
 a
 prediction


I
 think
 there
 is
 the
 clear
 shot
 across


the
 bow
 of
 closed
 source
 and
 I
 think


open
 source
 can


Why?


>> Because
 when
 Kimmy
 K2.5
 is
 accessible,


>> it
 democratizes
 something
 this
 trillion


parameter
 reasoning


>> that
 right
 now
 you
 could
 not
 otherwise


get.
 Now
 you
 can
 do
 vision
 to
 code,
 you


can
 do
 massive
 context
 windows.
 It's


really
 unbelievable
 and
 it's
 available


to
 everybody.


>> And
 to
 just
 build
 on
 it,
 you're
 exactly


correct
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 big


deal.
 You
 can
 run
 it.
 This
 is
 the
 other


thing.
 What
 What
 have
 the
 two
 limiting


factors
 been
 here?


>> I'm
 not
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 like
 these
 locally


hosted
 models.
 I
 think
 it's
 all
 [ __ ]


and
 janky.
 It's
 all
 like
 kids
 mucking


around.


>> I
 think
 running
 these
 things
 locally
 are


stupid
 and
 janky.


>> The
 whole
 point
 of
 open
 source
 is
 to
 go


and
 take
 them
 into
 these
 huge
 data


centers
 is
 to
 use
 nextgen
 silicon.
 And


we
 talked
 about
 this
 last
 week
 or
 the


week
 before
 where
 again
 post
 Grock
 what


I
 think
 will
 happen
 is
 you're
 going
 to


see
 an
 explosion
 of
 decode
 silicon.
 If


you
 take
 these
 next
 generation
 systems


and
 you
 marry
 them
 to
 open
 source
 you're


going
 to
 cut
 the
 cost
 of
 AI
 by
 90%.


And
 when
 you
 do
 that
 you
 know
 Jason
 your


bill
 is
 going
 to
 be
 10
 bucks
 a
 day.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you're
 just
 not
 going
 to
 stop.


Here's
 the
 interesting
 thing
 for
 me
 like


back
 to
 this
 like
 running
 it
 like
 there


are
 now
 people
 who
 figured
 out
 how
 to


daisy
 chain
 the
 Mac
 studios.
 So
 people


are
 you
 can
 see
 there's
 two
 stack
 there.


People
 are
 starting
 to
 stack
 these.
 This


is
 commodity
 hardware
 running
 open


source.
 The
 there's
 two
 advantages
 to


this
 one.
 We
 have
 control
 of
 all
 the


data.
 We
 have
 it
 on
 our
 own
 hardware.
 We


can
 run
 it
 infinitely.
 And
 these
 things


are
 only
 getting
 better.
 the
 M5
 chips


coming
 to
 these
 Mac
 studios
 and
 if
 you


want
 more
 power
 you
 stack
 it
 up
 and
 then


the
 open
 source
 models
 are
 getting


easier.
 So
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 is
 90%


or
 95%
 of
 our
 jobs
 are
 going to
 go
 to


this
 local
 hardware
 will
 control
 it.
 We


don't
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 our


information
 going
 up
 to
 Samman
 I
 canled


I
 canled
 all
 of
 my
 OpenAI
 accounts.


$25,000
 gone.
 It's
 a
 matter
 of
 time


until
 the
 big
 model
 makers
 create
 an


incremental
 revenue
 stream
 for
 guys
 like


you,
 Jason,
 to
 license
 back
 all
 your


prompt
 and
 response
 data.
 And
 you'll


probably
 make
 enough
 to
 pay
 for
 the
 all


the
 costs
 of
 hosting
 and
 running
 these


models.
 Anyways,


>> yeah.
 Anyway,
 I
 this
 is
 like
 feels
 like


>> it's
 a
 very
 big
 moment.


>> It's
 a
 big
 mo
 it
 feels
 like
 a
 very
 big


moment.
 And
 then,
 you
 know,
 let
 alone
 if


when
 do
 you
 think
 freeberg
 we
 get
 it
 on


here?
 When
 do
 we
 get
 it
 on
 our
 phones?


when
 we'll
 be
 running
 Kimmy.


>> We're
 not
 even
 talking
 about
 a
 lot
 of


the
 architectural
 changes
 that
 are


happening
 that
 we've
 talked
 about
 in
 the


past.
 There
 papers
 that
 indicate
 we


could
 probably
 go
 down
 by
 70
 to
 100x
 in


terms
 of
 compute
 need
 in
 how
 the
 the


model
 actually
 runs.
 So
 yeah,
 ultimately


these
 things
 end
 up
 on
 the
 on
 the
 iPhone


running
 locally
 and
 you
 don't
 need
 to
 go


to
 the
 cloud.
 By
 the
 way,
 just
 having


our
 nation's
 AIS
 are
 on
 the
 line
 here,
 I


think
 this
 has
 a
 dramatic
 effect.
 If
 you


play
 all
 of
 these
 paps
 out
 on
 the
 way
 a


lot
 of
 these
 states
 have
 written
 their


idiotic
 legislation
 where
 those
 those


legislative
 approaches
 encompass


strictly
 the
 view
 of
 AI
 being
 a
 chatbot


interface
 run
 by
 a
 single
 company


running
 a
 model
 in
 a
 data
 center.
 And
 if


all
 of
 the
 models
 end
 up
 running
 locally


on
 machines
 in
 open
 source,
 different


contexts,
 different
 use
 cases,
 all
 of


like
 we
 said
 from
 the
 beginning,
 all
 of


the
 [ __ ]
 idiotic,
 dumbass
 takes
 by


legislators
 on
 what
 they
 think
 they
 need


to
 regulate
 and
 how
 go
 out
 the
 window
 or


they
 create
 a
 lot
 of
 confusion
 on
 what's


actually
 going
 on
 in
 the
 real
 world
 and


it
 puts
 us
 at
 risk.
 I
 strongly
 endorse


the
 effort
 by
 those
 in
 the


administration
 to
 pass
 a
 federal
 AI


preeemption
 law
 that
 avoids
 all
 of
 this


nonsense
 in
 the
 states
 and
 the
 local


governments.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 this


evolution
 of
 AI
 from
 being
 centrally


hosted
 in
 data
 centers
 by
 closed
 models


through
 chatbot
 interfaces.
 All
 of
 those


layers
 break.
 You
 start
 to
 recognize


very
 quickly
 why
 you
 need
 to
 have


federal
 preeemption
 on
 this
 stuff


because
 people
 get
 way
 too
 ahead
 of
 it


and
 it's
 going
 to
 limit
 innovation.


>> Yeah.
 Did
 you
 just
 Well,
 obviously
 I


agree
 I
 agree
 with
 that.
 And
 again,
 just


to
 build
 on
 that
 point,
 you
 can't


underestimate
 how
 much
 the
 policy
 debate


in
 Washington
 has
 indexed
 on
 a
 single


use
 case.


>> That's
 what
 I'm
 saying.


>> Which
 was
 a
 niche
 fantasy
 chatbot


application,


>> right?


>> Yeah.
 That's
 all
 that
 people
 know.
 Yeah.


That's
 all
 they
 know.


>> That
 turned
 into
 horror
 stories.
 I
 mean,


legit
 horror
 stories.
 But


>> again,
 that
 is
 just
 not
 the
 predominant


use
 of
 AI.
 And
 it's
 certainly
 not
 going


to
 be
 in
 a
 year.


>> One
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it
 is
 imagine
 if


the
 internet
 came
 out
 and
 the
 only
 thing


that
 happened
 on
 the
 internet
 for
 the


first
 three
 years
 was
 like
 pornography


websites
 and
 like
 just
 like
 and
 then


people
 are
 like,
 "Okay,
 we
 got
 to


regulate
 the
 internet."
 And
 it's
 like,


"Hold
 on
 a
 second.
 This
 is
 an
 idiotic


use
 case.
 Perhaps
 we
 should
 take
 a
 zoom


out
 and
 think
 about
 what
 the
 internet


could
 enable
 and
 all
 of
 the
 other
 use


cases."
 And
 legislation
 needs
 to
 be


crafted
 with
 a
 bigger
 view.
 And
 perhaps


it's
 a
 little
 too
 early
 to
 make
 those


judgment
 calls.


>> Yeah.
 You
 got
 to
 wonder
 what
 impact
 this


is
 going
 to
 have
 on
 the
 valuations
 of


these
 companies.
 I
 mean,
 if
 you
 can
 run


this
 stuff
 locally
 on
 your
 own
 hardware,


you
 can
 bracket
 or
 put
 it
 in
 a
 virtual


machine
 and
 open
 source
 wins,
 it's
 going


to
 change
 the
 economics
 of
 everything.


And
 the
 people
 I'm
 talking
 to
 in


startups,
 which
 is
 where
 you
 always
 see


the
 most
 efficient
 use
 of
 technology,


they're
 all
 using
 Kimmy
 and
 what
 was
 the


other?


>> Let
 me
 ask
 you
 a
 question
 about
 that


actually,
 Chimoth.
 So
 Kimmy
 K2
 powerful


model
 but
 it
 is
 a
 Chinese
 model
 or
 at


least
 it
 originates
 in
 China
 obviously


once
 it's
 open
 source
 people
 can
 fork
 it


and
 make
 their
 own
 but
 does
 that
 concern


you
 particularly


around
 the
 use
 case
 of
 coding
 because


what
 if
 there
 was
 a
 secret
 prompt
 in
 the


model


>> zero
 day
 attack
 or
 something


>> well
 it's
 like
 something
 built
 into
 the


model
 that's
 secret
 that
 could
 inject


corrupted
 code
 and
 you
 know
 so
 much


code's
 now
 being
 written
 by
 these
 models


in
 such
 volume
 that
 I
 mean
 humans
 in
 the


beginning
 were
 checking
 it
 all.
 But
 now


even
 the
 founder
 of
 Cloudbot
 said
 he
 he


doesn't
 even
 check
 all
 the
 code
 because


he
 can't
 personally
 supervise
 all
 of
 it.


So
 as
 AI
 coding
 becomes
 a
 bigger
 and


bigger
 percentage.
 Right
 now
 it's


probably
 what
 like
 50%.
 As
 it
 goes
 to


99%
 no
 one's
 even
 checking
 it.
 You
 have


to
 really
 worry
 about
 prompt
 injections.


>> Exactly.


>> Code
 injections.


>> I
 think
 you're
 bringing
 up
 an
 important


point.
 Right
 now
 we
 overly
 rely
 on
 eval


to
 tell
 us
 how
 good
 a
 model
 is
 and
 I


don't
 think
 we've
 developed
 a
 standard


to
 I
 mean
 the
 the
 big
 model
 companies
 do


it
 internally
 but
 the
 safety
 teams


who
 are
 responsible
 for
 red
 teaming


these
 models
 don't
 really
 work
 as
 a


broad
 coalition.
 Everybody
 has
 their
 own


version
 of
 what
 they
 do
 to
 make
 sure


that
 their
 own
 models
 are
 good
 and


performant.
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 an


opportunity
 because
 somebody
 has
 to
 be


able
 to
 take
 an
 open
 source
 model.
 Let's


just
 say
 you're
 France
 and
 you're
 like,


"Wow,
 where
 am
 I
 in
 this
 whole
 AI
 race?


I'm
 nowhere.


We
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 applications
 that
 we


want
 to
 develop
 and
 we
 need
 our
 own


sovereign
 AI
 stack."
 And
 so,
 okay,
 we'll


take
 Kimmy
 K
 2.5.
 What
 do
 they
 do
 to


your
 point
 Sachs
 to
 get
 complete


assurance
 that
 that
 model
 is
 reliable


and
 safe
 under
 all
 weather
 conditions?


Honestly,
 the
 answer
 is
 I
 don't
 know


what
 they
 would
 do
 right
 now.
 But
 that's


the
 opportunity
 because
 somebody
 has
 to


be
 able
 to
 say,
 "Okay,
 look,
 we're
 going


to
 sandbox
 it
 in
 the
 following
 way.


We're
 going
 to
 run
 it
 under
 all
 these


race
 conditions.
 We're
 going to
 get
 to


all
 these
 corner
 cases
 so
 that
 we
 can


tell
 you
 that
 it's
 actually
 good
 to
 go


and
 then
 you
 can
 use
 it."
 But
 how
 long


will
 that
 take?
 And
 then
 by
 that
 time,


are
 we
 on
 Kimmy
 K3?
 And
 then
 what
 is


France
 supposed
 to
 do?
 I
 don't
 know.
 So


these
 are
 complicated
 questions.
 But


yeah,
 we
 do
 need
 an
 entire
 reimagining


of
 how
 you
 red
 team
 some
 of
 these
 open


source
 models,
 obviously.


>> And
 there's
 open
 source
 models
 being


made
 here
 in
 the
 US
 too,
 by
 the
 way.


>> Exactly.
 No,
 no.
 Meta
 is
 doing
 them.


>> Wherever
 it
 comes
 from,


>> you're
 going
 to
 need
 AI
 models
 to
 look


for
 corrupted
 code
 and
 to
 do
 the


security
 eval.
 And
 there's
 going
 to
 have


to
 be
 continuous
 monitoring.
 The
 good


thing
 about
 open
 source
 is
 that
 when
 one


person
 discovers
 a
 bug
 or
 a
 flaw
 or


whatever,
 they
 share
 it
 with
 the


community
 and
 then
 it
 gets
 patched


globally.


>> The
 the
 other
 problem
 with
 open
 source


though
 right
 now
 is
 you
 can't
 really


fork
 it
 and
 make
 it
 your
 own.
 Why?


Because
 there's
 so
 much
 investment
 by


Moonshot.
 That's
 the
 company
 that
 makes


Kim
 K2
 in
 that
 example
 that
 you'll
 have


so
 much
 drift
 in
 one
 version
 your
 fork


will
 be
 worthless.
 So
 why
 would
 you
 do


it?
 So
 again,
 it
 goes
 back
 to
 sachs.
 We


have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 say
 okay
 Moonshot


will
 provide
 Kimmy
 K2
 and
 every
 update


thereafter
 but
 now
 we
 need
 to
 stress


test
 it
 and
 we
 need
 to
 redte
 team
 it
 and


we
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 say
 that
 this


thing
 is
 bulletproof
 and
 right
 now
 there


is
 no
 clean
 way
 of
 going
 to
 a
 third


party
 vendor
 to
 do
 that
 in
 a
 quick


reliable
 cycle
 and
 that's
 a
 business


opportunity
 for
 somebody


just
 speaking
 of
 the
 business


opportunity
 I
 think
 there
 are
 a
 number


of
 American


>> AI
 companies
 that
 are
 working
 on
 open


source
 models
 it
 is
 a
 gap
 that
 we
 have


>> so
 and
 that
 is
 an
 opportunity
 I
 mean,


look,
 if
 you're
 running
 critical


infrastructure,
 I
 don't
 think
 you
 want


to
 be
 using
 a
 Chinese
 model,
 period,
 on


that
 critical
 infrastructure.


>> I
 think
 if
 you
 can
 get
 it
 validated
 by


an
 American
 company
 that's
 trustworthy,


then
 it's
 no
 longer
 really
 a
 Chinese


model.
 Chinese
 contributed
 some
 really


great
 ideas
 and
 now
 there's
 a
 branch


that
 you
 can
 use.
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 hard


to
 ignore
 how
 good
 this
 stuff
 is
 now.


>> It
 feels
 like
 this
 was
 a
 turning
 point


this
 week.
 Okay,
 I
 want
 to
 get
 to
 one


more
 important
 story.
 But
 dollar
 has


dropped
 as
 gold
 and
 silver
 and
 copper


have
 ripped.
 Dollar
 index
 is
 down
 10%
 in


the
 last
 year.
 Hit
 its
 lowest
 level
 in


four
 years
 on
 Tuesday.
 Trump
 was
 asked


if
 the
 dollar
 declined
 too
 much.
 His


quote,
 "No,
 I
 think
 it's
 great."
 Wall


Street
 thinks
 Trump
 wants
 a
 weaker


dollar
 to
 boost
 US
 manufacturing
 and


exports.
 Obviously,
 we
 have
 a
 weaker


dollar.
 That
 means
 the
 stuff
 from
 the
 US


is
 cheaper.
 Foreign
 stuff
 becomes
 more


expensive.
 Uh
 and
 um
 we
 have
 a
 situation


here,
 Freeberg,
 that
 you've
 talked


about.
 Money
 printing
 has
 increased
 to


$2.5
 trillion
 a
 year.
 Trump
 wants
 to


print
 an
 additional
 500
 billion
 more.


That
 would
 bring
 us
 close
 to
 3
 trillion


uh
 for
 the
 military
 and
 uh
 money
 has


poured
 into
 gold
 and
 silver
 which
 have


way
 outperformed
 the
 S&P.
 Shout
 out


Vinnie
 Lingham.
 Freeberg,
 your
 thoughts


on
 dollar
 devaluation
 and
 what
 we're


seeing?


Yeah.
 So,
 people
 talk
 about
 the
 market


going
 up,
 but
 I'll
 use
 an
 analogy.
 If


you
 live
 on
 an
 island
 and
 there's
 two


huts
 on
 the
 island
 and
 there's
 a
 bunch


of
 shells
 that
 people
 are
 using
 for


trade,
 each
 house
 is
 going
 to
 be
 worth
 a


certain
 number
 of
 shells.
 And
 then
 if


people
 went
 and
 found
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of


more
 shells,
 the
 price
 per
 house
 would


go
 up
 in
 number
 of
 shells.
 But
 there's


just
 more
 shells
 in
 in
 the
 supply.
 And


effectively,
 you've
 inflated
 everything.


And
 that's
 effectively
 what's
 gone
 on


with
 the
 US
 fiscal
 condition.
 We've


talked
 about
 this
 many
 times,
 but
 I


think
 it's
 always
 worth
 a
 rehash.
 In
 a


democracy
 like
 we
 have
 for
 the
 past
 250


years,
 without
 adequate
 constitutional


constraints,
 it
 has
 always
 been
 the
 case


that
 over
 time
 spending
 goes
 up.


Government
 spending
 goes
 up.
 And
 this
 is


because
 in
 a
 democracy,
 people
 ask
 for


their
 government
 to
 do
 more
 every
 year.


And
 as
 they
 ask
 for
 their
 government
 to


do
 more
 every
 year,
 the
 government


agents
 who
 are
 elected
 say,
 "Okay,
 here


you
 go."
 And
 they
 spend
 more.


Eventually,
 when
 the
 borrowing
 capacity


gets
 unlocked,
 which
 is
 what
 happened
 in


the
 United
 States
 when
 we
 went
 off
 the


gold
 standard,
 you
 borrow
 like
 crazy.


You
 print
 money
 to
 to
 fund
 those


borrowing
 costs
 and
 you
 use
 that


fundamentally
 to
 drive
 the
 next
 voting


cycle,
 which
 is
 to
 give
 people
 more
 and


more
 of
 what
 they
 want.
 But
 eventually,


the
 bill
 comes
 to
 you
 and
 in
 the
 United


States,
 the
 bill
 is
 coming
 to
 you.
 Let's


start
 by
 looking
 at
 the
 money
 supply


chart.
 This
 is
 the
 M2
 money
 supply


chart,
 showing
 the
 rapid
 rise
 in
 dollars


in
 supply
 as
 a
 function
 of
 the
 central


bank
 of
 the
 United
 States.
 the
 Federal


Reserve
 making
 loans
 to
 banks
 ultimately


to
 fund
 federal
 spending.
 I
 mean
 really


an
 extraordinary
 number.
 And
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 M2
 money
 supply
 chart
 going
 back


to
 1960,


1955


and
 you
 can
 see
 postcoid
 we
 were
 hoping


that
 we
 would
 have
 resolved
 and
 sort
 of


reduced
 the
 money
 supply
 by
 some
 amount


but
 co
 really
 created
 this
 accelerating


mechanism
 and
 you
 know
 we're
 back
 on


track
 in
 the
 last
 couple
 of
 years
 to


increasing
 the
 money
 supply.
 And
 so
 over


time
 the
 the
 US
 dollar
 gets
 devalued
 as


there
 are
 simply
 more
 dollars
 in
 the


market
 and
 US
 treasuries
 gets


challenged.
 So
 if
 we
 take
 a
 look
 here


around
 the
 world
 central
 banks
 have


decided
 that
 they
 no
 longer
 want
 to
 hold


US
 treasuries.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 the
 value


of
 gold
 versus
 treasuries
 in
 central


banks
 in
 their
 inventory.
 So
 we
 are
 now


seeing
 that
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in


history
 or


>> no
 no
 hold
 on
 that's
 not
 accurate.
 It's


not
 like
 they're
 selling.
 This
 line
 just


shows
 it's
 stable
 per
 se,
 right?
 It's


more
 that
 the
 incremental
 buying
 is
 in


real
 assets.


>> Yeah.
 But
 this
 dollar
 the
 dollar
 value


is
 also
 adjusted.
 So
 fundamentally
 I


mean
 one
 way
 to
 think
 about
 this
 is
 the


relative
 value
 of
 central
 bank
 holdings


around
 the
 world.
 We
 now
 see
 gold


eclipsing
 US
 treasuries.
 So
 now
 gold
 is


a
 larger
 share
 of
 the
 holdings.
 Yeah.
 So


now
 gold
 is
 the
 largest
 share
 of
 the


holdings
 of
 central
 banks.
 If
 you
 look


at
 the
 next
 chart
 which
 is
 just
 over
 the


past
 year
 as
 JCL
 pointed
 out
 this
 is
 the


dollar
 index.
 So
 it's
 the
 dollar
 against


a
 basket
 of
 foreign
 currencies
 has


declined
 you
 know
 from
 a
 index
 of
 about


call
 it
 109
 down
 to
 96
 today.
 This
 chart


actually
 looks
 at
 so
 what
 is
 the
 US


stock
 market
 trading
 at
 and
 instead
 of


trading
 it
 in
 US
 dollars
 what
 if
 you


just
 looked
 at
 the
 US
 stock
 market
 the


total
 value
 in
 ounces
 of
 gold.
 And
 so
 if


we
 had
 the
 gold
 standard
 still
 and
 if
 we


functionally
 converted
 stock
 market


value
 from
 dollars
 back
 into
 gold,
 you


can
 see
 that
 the
 stock
 market
 in
 the


United
 States
 over
 the
 past
 years,
 so


this
 is
 about
 seven
 and
 a
 half
 years


going
 back
 to
 the
 pre-COVID
 era,
 is


actually
 down,
 down
 pretty
 substantively


from
 the
 pre-COVID
 era.
 So
 stock
 markets


are
 fundamentally
 down.
 Everyone's


cheering,
 clapping,
 bouncing
 up
 and


down.
 Stock
 markets
 are
 up.
 Stock


markets
 are
 up.
 And
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell


you
 why
 this
 is
 important
 in
 a
 minute.


Uh,
 and
 everyone's,
 you
 know,
 jumping
 up


and
 down
 saying,
 "Great,
 the
 stock


market's
 up."
 The
 stock
 market's
 up
 in


dollar
 denominated
 terms.
 But
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 stock
 market
 relative
 to


gold,
 it's
 actually
 down.
 And
 the


sell-off
 is
 not
 just
 in
 the
 stock
 market


relative
 to
 gold,
 but
 you
 can
 actually


look
 importantly
 at
 the
 metric
 that
 we


all
 should
 care
 the
 most
 about,
 which
 is


US
 Treasury
 yield.
 So,
 this
 is
 the


30-year.
 So,
 the
 30-year
 yield
 is
 now
 at


4.9%.


The
 average
 US
 government's
 cost
 to


borrow
 today
 is
 3.3%.


So
 if
 we
 end
 up
 needing
 to
 roll
 all
 of


the
 US
 government
 debt,
 assuming
 we
 take


on
 no
 new
 debt,
 which
 we
 know
 is
 not
 the


case,
 $39
 trillion
 of
 debt
 outstanding,


the
 federal
 government
 level
 today,
 and


it
 had
 to
 get
 refinanced
 at
 this
 rate,


we
 would
 have
 an
 incremental
 annual
 cost


to
 service
 the
 debt,
 just
 the
 interest


on
 the
 existing
 debt,
 of
 roughly
 $700


billion
 a
 year.
 incremental
 cost
 to


service
 existing
 debt
 as
 interest
 rates


climb
 from
 3.3
 to
 5%.
 And
 so


fundamentally,
 this
 is
 about
 70%
 of
 the


current
 defense
 budget.
 It's
 about
 10%


of
 the
 overall
 federal
 budget.
 It's
 a


significant
 percentage
 of
 US
 GDP,
 about


3%
 of
 US
 GDP.
 It's
 a
 substantial
 number


and
 it
 creates
 the
 spiraling
 problem


that
 we're
 in.
 Now,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 make


one
 final
 point.
 So,
 there's
 this


dolorization
 moment.
 It's
 always
 worth


having
 a
 reflection
 on
 it,
 but
 I
 just


want
 to
 tie
 it
 back
 to
 Minnesota,
 Donald


Trump,
 and
 socialism.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 important
 for
 us
 to


just
 highlight
 that
 if
 you
 own
 assets


like
 we
 do,
 the
 four
 of
 us,
 we
 own


stocks,
 we
 own
 real
 estate,
 we
 own
 other


assets.
 As
 the
 dollar
 devalues
 and


everything
 inflates
 in
 value,
 our
 asset


prices
 go
 up
 and
 we
 get
 wealthier
 and


wealthier
 and
 wealthier.
 The
 majority
 of


Americans
 do
 not
 own
 assets.
 They
 are


net
 asset
 negative.
 As
 a
 result,
 they


live
 off
 of
 income


and
 they
 do
 not
 benefit
 from
 the


ddollarization
 like
 asset
 holders
 do.


And
 this
 is
 what
 is
 ultimately
 fueling


populism
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 And
 the


populism
 in
 the
 United
 States
 is
 what
 is


driving
 socialism.
 And
 the
 response
 to


those
 behaviors
 is
 what
 Donald
 Trump


elected
 to
 some
 degree.
 and
 the
 response


to
 the
 Donald
 Trump
 actions
 is
 what's


driving
 the
 civil
 unrest
 in
 Minnesota


and
 other
 places.
 And
 I
 fundamentally


believe
 that
 much
 of
 the
 unrest,
 the


civil
 unrest,
 and
 ultimately
 this
 divide


in
 this
 country
 is
 driven
 by
 the
 fact


that
 ddollarization
 because
 of
 excess


government
 spending
 ultimately
 leads
 a


majority
 of
 people
 in
 this
 country
 to


feeling
 oppressed
 and
 left
 behind


because
 they're
 seeing
 a
 few
 people
 in


the
 country
 accelerate
 their
 net
 worth


like
 all
 of
 us
 here.
 And
 there's
 no
 way


for
 them
 to
 catch
 up
 because
 they
 don't


actually
 own
 assets.
 So,
 I'll
 be
 I'll


I'll
 be
 honest
 with
 you
 guys
 and
 make
 a


confession.
 I
 was
 kind
 of
 at
 I
 was
 at


the
 gym
 this
 morning
 on
 the
 treadmill.


>> You
 were
 at
 the
 gym.


>> Yeah.
 And
 while
 I
 was
 there,
 I
 was


actually
 thinking
 about
 the
 wealth
 tax


stuff
 that's
 going
 on
 in
 California.
 And


I
 I
 wonder
 if
 it
 may
 be
 an
 inevitability


in
 order
 to
 keep
 the
 United
 States
 from


going
 into
 civil
 war.
 I
 mean
 that
 very


wholeheartedly.
 Like
 I
 just
 don't
 know


if
 there's
 a
 way
 of
 solving
 this
 fiscal


problem
 without
 a
 functional


redistribution
 of
 wealth.
 And
 the


question
 is
 can
 you
 do
 it
 violently
 or


nonviolently?
 And
 if
 there's
 a


nonviolent
 path,
 I
 think
 that's
 probably


the
 preferable
 path.


>> Did
 you
 ever
 think
 about
 do
 you
 ever


think
 about
 violently
 picking
 up
 some
 of


those
 weights?


We
 can
 leave
 that
 that
 in
 or
 take
 it


out.


>> The
 problem
 with
 that
 is
 look,
 you
 know,


where
 this
 California
 wealth
 tax
 is


going,
 right?
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 the


quote
 unquote
 people.
 It's
 going
 to


these
 special
 interests
 who've
 been


looting
 the
 state
 for
 decades.


>> Audit
 everything
 before
 you
 raise
 taxes.


It's
 very
 simple,
 folks.
 Audit


everything.


>> I
 mean,
 if
 the
 money
 is
 going
 to
 waste,


foreign
 abuse,
 and
 special
 interest,


then
 how
 do
 you
 solve
 the
 divide


problem?
 I
 mean,
 I
 guess
 the
 ones
 that


the
 special
 interests
 are
 capable
 of


organizing
 are
 able
 to
 extract,
 but


doesn't
 actually
 solve
 the
 problem.
 In


fact,
 everything
 gets
 worse
 because


>> yeah,


>> those
 government
 special
 interests


generally
 rig
 the
 system
 in
 their
 favor


in
 a
 way
 that
 actually
 raises
 the
 cost


for
 everybody.


>> So
 you
 look
 at
 California,
 everything's


performing
 worse.


>> Can
 we
 pour
 one
 out
 for
 David
 Freeberg's


favorite


government
 program?


>> Free
 beer.


>> Free
 beer.


>> Free
 homeless
 for
 55
 homeless
 people


suffering
 from
 the
 shakes.
 And
 they


spent
 $6
 million
 on
 it,
 but
 it's
 over.
 6


million
 a
 year.
 6
 million
 a
 year
 for
 60


bo
 hobos
 to
 get
 beer
 because
 they
 had


the
 shakes.
 The
 dream
 is
 over.
 The
 dream


is
 over.
 Freeberg.
 No
 more
 free
 beer.


>> By
 the
 way,
 I
 think
 Sax's
 point
 is
 the


right
 point,
 which
 is
 the
 resolution
 to


this
 isn't
 a
 fair


and
 reasonable
 redistribution
 of
 assets.


It's
 fundamentally
 a
 moment
 of


extraordinary
 theft.
 When
 there's
 this


massive
 movement
 of
 capital
 like
 this


through
 a
 centralized
 system
 like
 the


government,
 there's
 no
 free
 market


transition
 of
 capital
 and
 as
 a
 result


you
 end
 up
 most
 seeing
 a
 large


percentage
 of
 it
 go
 into
 into
 theft
 back


into
 the
 hands
 of
 a
 few
 who
 were
 really


good
 at
 capturing
 that
 money
 as
 it
 comes


out
 of
 the
 government's
 coffers.
 That's


a
 good
 point.


>> You've
 diagnosed
 this
 many
 times.
 I


mean,
 look,
 Texas
 and
 Florida


do
 a
 better
 job
 for
 their
 population


collecting
 half
 as
 much
 in
 taxes
 per


capita
 as
 California
 does.
 And
 having
 no


income
 tax
 or
 capital
 gains
 tax,


>> that's
 because
 if
 you
 commit
 fraud
 here,


we
 put
 you
 in
 a
 firing
 squad.
 That's
 how


it
 works.
 Right
 to
 the
 firing
 squad.


We're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the
 range.
 Let's
 go


to
 the
 Come
 by
 Sachs.
 Come
 by
 the
 ranch.


I
 have
 a
 shooting
 range.


>> Matt
 Matt
 Mayan
 entered
 the
 California


guminatorial
 race.
 He's
 running
 for


governor.


>> He's
 running
 California.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 what
 does
 it
 mean?
 Who
 is
 he?
 Explain


to
 the
 audience
 why
 this
 is
 important.


>> Well,
 he's
 the
 mayor
 of
 San
 Jose.


>> Chats
 are
 on
 fire.


>> Yeah.
 He's
 much
 more
 of
 a
 moderate
 and


he's
 not
 a
 union
 captured
 candidate.


>> Oh,
 here's
 your
 poly.


>> Yeah,
 here's
 poly
 market.
 So,
 Matt
 Mayan


announced
 this
 morning
 very
 late
 entry


to
 the
 gubernatorial
 race.
 Katie
 Porter


is
 kind
 of
 the,
 you
 know,
 the
 output
 of


the
 Democratic
 machine.
 Tommy
 Styer
 is


the
 billionaire
 climate
 change
 advocate.


But
 Swallwell,
 you
 know,
 the
 congressman


from
 the
 east,


>> hasn't
 met
 a
 virtue.
 He
 doesn't
 want
 a


signal.


>> He's
 literally
 like
 Christmas
 lights


blinking.


>> Tom
 St.


>> Well,
 look,
 if
 if
 if
 Maym,
 is
 that
 the


right
 way
 to
 pronounce
 his
 name?


>> Yeah.
 Matt
 Mayan.


>> Matt
 Mayan.
 California
 has
 a
 jungle


primary,
 right?
 So,
 everyone's
 running


at
 the
 same
 time.
 There's
 no
 separate


lanes
 for
 Democrats
 or
 Republicans.
 If


he
 ends
 up
 top
 two,
 let's
 say
 it's
 him


and
 Swallwell,
 I
 think
 he'll
 win
 because


all
 the
 Republicans
 will
 vote
 for
 him.


They'll
 go
 for
 the
 more
 centrist


candidate.


>> We
 had
 a
 political
 strategist
 over
 for


dinner.
 There's
 a
 version
 where
 the
 top


two
 people
 could
 be
 both
 Republicans


actually
 right
 now.
 Current
 course
 and


speed,
 the
 top
 two
 vote
 getters
 are


trending
 to
 be
 both
 Republican.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 like
 the
 Karen.
 The
 Karen's
 the
 most


entertaining.
 She's
 the
 one
 who
 said,


"Get
 out
 of
 my
 shot."
 That's
 the
 one.


>> Katy
 Porter.


>> The
 get
 out
 of
 my
 shot
 one.


>> Yeah.
 She's
 tumbling.
 She's
 tumbling.


Yeah,
 she's
 not
 doing
 well.
 She's
 coming


down
 in
 the
 she's
 not
 likable
 and
 she


seems
 and
 I
 think
 everyone
 sees
 right


through
 her
 as
 being,
 you
 know,


effectively
 captured
 by
 California


institutions,


>> but
 Maym
 and
 Swallwell
 much
 more


independent,
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to


be
 a
 battle
 between
 the
 two
 of
 them.


>> Just
 to
 go
 back
 to
 your
 point,
 Jamas,
 so


what's
 interesting
 is
 there
 are
 two


Republicans
 running
 for
 governor
 of


California.
 Chad
 Biano,
 who's
 a
 sheriff,


and
 then
 Steve


>> Steve
 Hilton,


>> who's
 a
 political
 commentator,
 used
 to


be
 on
 Fox
 News.
 They're
 both
 at
 about


15%.
 Which
 actually
 puts
 them
 in
 the


lead
 or
 close
 to
 the
 lead
 because
 the


field's
 so
 fragmented
 right
 now.


Exactly.
 The
 problem
 that
 they
 have
 is


so
 I
 guess
 if
 the
 field
 stayed


permanently
 fragmented,
 yes,
 they
 could


be
 in
 the


>> Could
 you
 imagine
 the
 melting
 mines?


>> Yeah.
 But
 that's
 not
 going
 to
 happen
 as


much
 as
 I
 would
 like
 it
 to
 because
 the


Democratic
 field's
 going
 to
 coalesce
 and


if
 it
 doesn't
 coales
 the
 the
 party


machine
 will
 get
 together
 and
 they'll


tell
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 to
 drop
 out
 and


get
 real


>> and
 they'll
 they'll
 basically
 shift
 it.


So
 the
 problem
 with
 the
 Republicans
 is


and
 it
 actually
 be
 better
 if
 there
 was


one
 Republican
 instead
 of
 two
 because


they
 need
 to
 be
 at
 like
 30%.
 Right.


>> Right.


>> But
 you
 know
 they're
 each
 going
 to
 get


15%.
 They
 they
 have
 more
 of
 a
 ceiling
 is


what
 I'm
 trying
 to
 say.
 Right.


>> Yeah.
 That's
 true.
 That
 is
 true.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 only
 the
 final
 two
 that
 make


it
 into
 the
 general.
 So,
 if
 the
 rest
 of


the
 Dems
 literally
 stay
 equal
 and


there's
 five
 Dems
 that
 are
 at
 like
 5
 to


10%
 each,
 you
 could
 end
 up
 seeing
 the


two
 Republicans
 in
 the
 top
 two
 spots.


>> I
 don't
 think
 that's
 going to
 happen.
 I


don't
 think
 you're
 going to
 end
 up
 with


five
 Dems
 at
 at
 10%.
 I
 think
 what
 could


happen
 though
 actually
 is
 it's
 probably


better
 that
 you
 have
 two
 Republicans


rather
 than
 one
 because
 the
 disaster


would
 be
 let's
 say
 you
 end
 up
 with


Swallwell
 and
 one
 of
 the
 Republicans
 in


the
 runoff,
 then
 Swallwell
 definitely


wins.
 That's
 what
 always
 happens,
 right?


>> The
 best
 chance
 for
 Matt
 Mayan
 is
 that


it's
 him
 versus
 either
 a
 Democrat
 or
 a


Republican
 actually.


>> And
 then
 if
 he's
 up
 against
 a
 Democrat,


a
 more
 liberal
 Democrat
 like
 Swallwell,


the
 Republicans
 will
 support
 Maym
 and


he'll
 win.
 And
 if
 he's
 up
 against
 a


Republican,
 then
 he'll
 also
 win
 because


all
 the
 Democrats
 will
 support
 him.
 And


remember,
 this
 is
 like
 a
 plus
 20
 or
 30


blue
 state.
 So,


>> and
 by
 the
 way,
 he
 is
 such
 a
 good
 guy.


He's
 been
 such
 an
 effective
 mayor
 of
 San


Jose.
 you
 know,
 he
 cleared
 up


homelessness.
 I
 mean,
 his
 polic
 actual


work
 running
 something
 stands
 out


amongst
 the
 rest
 of
 these
 folks.
 So,
 I


think
 he's
 got
 a
 real
 shot,
 Sachs,
 at


moving
 up
 real
 fast,
 even
 though
 he's


coming.


>> Well,
 yeah.
 Look,
 if
 he
 plays
 his
 cards


right,
 he
 could
 win.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I


think
 there
 is
 a
 a
 path
 here
 for


California
 restoration.
 You
 get
 someone


like
 Matt
 Mayan
 as
 governor,
 maybe
 Rick


Caruso
 takes
 another
 shot
 at
 running
 for


mayor
 in
 LA.


>> I
 think
 everyone
 recognizes
 that.


>> Get
 in
 the
 game.


>> I
 think
 everyone
 recognizes
 that
 Karen


Bass
 has
 been
 a
 disaster.
 She,
 you
 know,


aided
 and
 abetted
 the


>> burning
 down
 of
 the
 Palisades.
 And
 then


if
 you
 defeat
 the
 wealth
 tax
 so
 that
 the


>> Wait,
 did
 Trump
 take
 over,


>> you
 could
 have
 a
 path?


>> Did
 Trump
 just
 take
 over
 the
 rebuild
 in


Pacific
 Palisades
 with
 an
 executive


order?
 Did
 I
 see
 that
 in
 my
 feed?


>> He
 did.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 there's


been
 a
 very
 small
 number
 of
 permits


granted.
 I
 mean,
 how
 long
 has
 it
 been


like
 18
 months
 now?


>> Sound
 [ __ ]


>> Wait,
 so
 Sax,
 would
 you
 move
 back
 if


there
 was
 a
 great
 restoration
 in


California?


I
 feel
 like
 somehow
 it's
 just
 not
 going


to
 happen.
 You
 know,
 it's
 like


>> it's
 over.
 Not
 in
 our
 lifetime.


>> I
 feel
 like
 the
 fact
 that
 you're
 telling


me
 that
 Ma
 May
 is
 this
 great
 candidate


and,
 you
 know,
 the
 whole
 tech
 world's


going
 to
 get
 behind
 him.
 I'm
 sure
 that's


true.
 And
 then
 somehow
 I
 think
 it's
 the


reason
 he's
 going
 to
 lose
 and
 I
 think,


you
 know,
 we'll
 end
 up
 with
 Swallwell,


who
 I
 think


>> you're
 so
 jaded,
 Sax.
 I
 think
 that


somehow


>> well
 Swall
 is
 considered
 to
 be
 kind
 of
 a


lightweight
 and
 a
 pretty
 dim
 bulb.


>> Friend
 of
 the
 pond,
 Eric
 Swall,
 come


back
 anytime.
 Who
 interviewed
 him
 with


me?


>> Jim,
 was
 that
 you?
 Did
 you
 interview
 him


with
 me?


>> Yeah,
 I
 did.
 Yeah,
 you
 did.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean,
 just
 manifestly
 not
 up
 to
 the


challenges
 that
 are
 going
 to
 beset


California
 in
 the
 coming
 years.
 You
 need


someone
 really
 stellar
 to
 clean
 things


up
 after
 the
 fiscal
 insanity
 of
 the


Newsome
 years.


>> Well,
 look,
 I'll
 restate
 this
 on
 the


show
 very
 clearly.
 California
 has
 a


trillion
 dollar
 fiscal
 cliff
 coming
 up


because
 of
 the
 pension
 obligations.
 I


don't
 know if
 you
 guys
 know
 this.
 I'll


make
 this
 one
 point
 very
 important
 to


know.
 They
 once
 tried
 to
 change
 the


benefits,
 the
 pension
 benefits,
 and
 they


lost
 a
 court
 case.
 And
 so
 there's


precedent
 in
 California
 state
 court
 that


you
 cannot
 change
 pension
 benefits
 on


the
 date
 that
 someone
 was
 hired.
 You
 can


never
 change
 their
 future
 benefits.


Really
 important
 to
 know.
 So
 all
 of
 the


benefits
 that
 have
 been
 given
 to
 every


California
 public
 employee
 up
 to
 this


day
 or
 that
 they've
 been
 promised,
 they


are
 promised
 for
 life
 and
 you're
 not


allowed
 to
 take
 them
 out
 and
 they
 cannot


be
 disposed
 of
 except
 for
 some
 form
 of


bankruptcy.
 And
 there
 is
 no
 mechanism
 by


which
 the
 state
 can
 declare
 bankruptcy.


So
 fundamentally
 and
 functionally,
 there


are
 two
 ways
 that
 California
 can
 be


saved.
 Number
 one,
 you
 pass
 an
 amendment


to
 the
 Constitution
 to
 fix
 this
 pension


liability
 problem.
 And
 number
 two
 is
 the


state
 has
 the
 ability
 to
 declare


bankruptcy.
 Everything
 else
 is
 all
 about


how
 long
 are
 you
 keeping
 the
 state
 alive


for.


>> Well,
 I
 I
 I
 support
 that
 that
 change
 to


bankruptcy
 law.
 I
 just
 think
 it'll
 be


hard
 to
 get.
 But,
 you
 know,
 we
 could


try.
 And
 look,
 if
 you
 had
 a
 governor
 of


California


come
 to
 the
 federal
 government
 and
 say,


"We
 would
 like
 this,"
 then
 there's
 a


much
 higher
 chance
 of
 it
 happening.
 But


actually,
 I
 think
 one
 question
 I
 think


one
 question


>> for
 you
 to
 ask
 in
 evaluating
 this
 is


what
 does
 Gavin
 Newsome
 want?
 Because


obviously
 he's
 running
 for
 president
 in


2028,
 you
 know,
 who
 would
 he
 like
 to


replace
 him
 as
 governor?
 You
 know,
 and


obviously
 he
 doesn't
 want
 a
 Republican


because
 that'd
 be
 a
 rebuke.
 You
 know,


does
 he
 want
 Swall?
 Does
 he
 want
 someone


who
 will
 appear
 even
 weaker
 and
 stupider


than
 him?
 or
 does
 he
 want
 someone
 like


Maym
 who
 will
 be
 appearing


>> to
 clean
 up
 the
 state?
 I
 think
 he
 might


want
 the
 idiot


>> although
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 tough
 it's
 a


tough
 tough
 choice
 for
 him.


>> She'll
 just
 scream.
 I
 like


>> Well,
 here's
 the
 thing
 is
 he
 also


doesn't
 want
 the
 state
 to
 fall
 apart


while
 he's
 running
 for
 president
 cuz
 he


might
 be
 blamed
 for
 that
 too.


>> So,
 does
 he
 want
 someone
 like
 Compton


like
 Maym
 who's
 criticized
 him
 because


Maym
 has
 criticized
 Newsome
 on
 things


like
 homelessness,
 right?


>> So,
 Gavin
 is
 super
 thin
 skin.


>> They
 can
 get
 past
 that.


>> I
 don't know.
 But
 Gavin
 is
 super
 thin


skinned,
 so
 I'm
 sure
 he
 resents
 that.
 So


probably
 the
 machine
 gets
 behind


Swallwell,


even
 though
 it
 probably
 means
 a
 train


wreck
 for
 the
 state.
 But
 we'll
 see.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 a
 good


idea.
 Yeah,
 I
 think
 he
 would
 want.


>> But
 this
 is
 a
 big
 opportunity
 for
 tech


to
 flex
 his
 political
 muscles
 to
 see.


>> Yeah,
 let's
 see.
 Let's
 see.


>> Let's
 see
 if
 they
 can
 do
 it.
 Let's
 see


if
 they
 can
 do
 it.


>> It's
 not
 just
 tech.
 It's
 anyone
 that


doesn't
 want
 an
 establishment
 governor.


And
 I
 think
 that
 includes
 Hollywood.
 It


includes
 agriculture.
 It
 includes
 large


swats
 of
 the
 state's
 economy.
 So,
 let's


see
 what
 happens.


>> All
 right,
 everybody.
