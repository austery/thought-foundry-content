Hello
 my
 friends,
 today
 is
 January
 17th


and
 this
 is
 Markets
 Weekly.
 So
 this
 past


week
 was
 a
 week
 jam-packed
 full
 of
 Fed


news.
 So
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


Looking
 at
 the
 markets
 more
 broadly


though,
 it
 continues
 to
 seem
 to
 me
 that


the
 markets
 are
 losing
 momentum.
 Now
 you


even
 see
 high
 flyers
 like
 silver
 being


sold.
 Now
 we
 are
 moving
 away
 from
 the


very
 seasonally
 positive
 part
 of
 the


year.
 So,
 it
 would
 not
 surprise
 me
 if
 we


were
 to
 consolidate
 or
 correct
 for
 the


coming
 weeks.
 Now,
 this
 episode
 we're


going
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 Fed,
 but
 I
 still


want
 to
 mention
 a
 couple
 notable
 things.


First
 off,
 there
 was
 escalating


geopolitical
 risk
 in
 the
 Middle
 East.


The
 president
 seems
 to
 have
 held
 off
 on


any
 military
 action,
 but
 as
 we
 know,
 the


president
 doesn't
 like
 to
 announce


military
 action
 before
 it
 happens.
 He


says
 that's
 stupid.
 I
 agree
 with
 him.


And
 of
 course
 he
 only
 likes
 to
 act


during
 the
 weekends
 when
 the
 markets
 are


closed.
 And
 secondly
 uh
 also
 uh
 the


president
 seems
 to
 be
 escalating
 his


rhetoric
 on
 Greenland.
 You
 seem
 to
 have


NATO
 members
 sending
 troops
 to
 kind
 of


make
 a
 stand
 over
 there.
 And
 as
 we're


recording
 it
 seems
 like
 there's
 a


headline
 saying
 that
 the
 president
 will


put
 tariffs
 on
 European
 countries
 for


supporting
 Greenland.
 So
 that
 is


something
 to
 keep
 in
 mind
 then
 as
 well.


I
 know
 many
 of
 you
 comment
 or
 some
 of


you
 comment
 why
 is
 he
 talking
 about


politics.
 Isn't
 this
 a
 markets
 show?


From
 my
 perspective,
 politics
 and


markets
 are
 the
 same
 thing.
 Okay,
 now


moving
 on.
 So
 today
 we're
 going
 to
 talk


about
 two
 things.
 First
 off,
 huge


developments
 on
 the
 race
 to
 be
 Fed


chair.
 On
 Friday,
 the
 president


basically
 ruled
 out
 Kevin
 Hasset
 and
 it


seems
 like
 it's
 likely
 that
 Kevin
 Walsh


will
 be
 Fed
 chair.
 So
 let's
 talk
 about


what
 happened.
 And
 there
 was
 a
 very


distinct
 market
 reaction
 to
 that
 and


what
 that
 could
 mean.
 And
 secondly,
 I


think
 the
 biggest
 F
 news
 of
 the
 past


week
 was
 of
 course
 the
 very
 memorable


2-minute
 video
 JPL
 recorded
 last
 Sunday.


J.
 Pal
 basically
 told
 the
 world
 that


guys,
 President
 Trump
 is
 trying
 to
 take


over
 monetary
 policy.
 Please
 help.
 And


um
 I
 think
 this
 is
 just
 a
 sign
 of
 the


times.
 I
 believe
 that
 we
 are
 in
 the


twilight
 of
 the
 central
 banks
 and
 that


uh
 the
 Fed
 will
 not
 be
 an
 independent


central
 bank
 and
 many
 other
 central


banks
 in
 the
 world
 will
 lose
 their


independence
 as
 well
 and
 it's
 going
 to


be
 okay.


All right,
 starting
 with
 the
 hasset


tantrum.
 So
 on
 Friday
 the
 president
 was


doing
 a
 press
 conference
 about
 health


related
 stuff
 and
 basically
 just
 you


know
 began
 it
 by
 saying
 this.


>> I
 see
 Kevin's
 in
 the
 audience
 and
 I
 just


want
 to
 thank
 you.
 You
 were
 fantastic
 on


television
 today.
 I
 actually
 want
 to


keep
 you
 where
 you
 are.
 If
 you
 want
 to


know
 the
 truth,
 Kevin
 Hassid
 is
 so
 good.


I'm
 saying,
 "Wait
 a
 minute.
 If
 I
 move


them,
 these
 fed
 guys,
 certainly
 the
 one


we
 have
 now,
 they
 don't
 talk
 much.
 I


would
 lose
 you.
 I
 It's
 a
 serious
 concern


to
 me."
 So,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 thank
 you


very
 much.
 You've
 done
 incredible.


We
 don't
 want
 to
 lose
 him,
 Susie.
 We'll


see
 how
 it
 all
 works
 out.
 Okay.
 Thank


you,
 Kevin.
 Now


after
 he
 said
 this
 there
 was
 a
 very


immediate
 market
 reaction.
 So
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 betting
 markets
 you
 can
 see


that
 the
 chances
 of
 Kevin
 Hasset
 being


fed
 chair
 totally
 tanked
 and
 chances
 of


Kevin
 Walsh
 being
 fed
 fed
 chair


basically
 surged.
 So
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 an


interesting
 development
 because
 uh
 Kevin


Hassid
 was
 someone
 who
 was
 longtime


considered
 to
 be
 the
 favorite
 because


Kevin
 Hassid
 has
 been
 a
 very
 longtime


Trump
 loyalist.
 uh
 he
 was
 basically


Trump's
 economist
 during
 his
 first
 term


and
 he
 holds
 a
 big
 position
 today
 in
 his


second
 term.
 So
 his
 many
 years
 of


loyalty
 was
 thought
 to
 be
 someone
 that


Trump
 would
 trust.
 And
 to
 be
 clear,


Kevin
 Hasset
 has
 good
 credentials
 and


comes
 from
 basically
 very
 mainstream


policy
 institutions,
 even
 once
 of
 course


briefly
 working
 at
 the
 Fed.
 So
 it
 looks


like
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 Fed
 chair.
 But


he's
 also
 of
 course
 widely
 perceived
 to


be
 a
 yes
 man
 to
 Trump.
 So
 if
 President


Trump
 would
 like
 to
 have,
 you
 know,
 low


interest
 rates,
 it
 was
 widely
 perceived


that
 Kevin
 Hassid
 would
 do
 whatever
 he


could
 to
 make
 that
 happen.
 Kevin
 Walsh,


on
 the
 other
 hand,
 is
 a
 longtime
 hawk.


He
 was
 one
 time
 once
 a
 governor
 on
 on


the
 Fed.
 Uh
 but
 throughout
 the
 years,


consistently
 made
 speech
 after
 speech


saying
 hawkish
 stuff.
 Even
 when
 he
 was


at
 the
 Fed,
 he
 was
 always
 very
 hawkish.


Even
 right
 before
 Leman
 Brothers


collapsed
 heading
 into
 the
 great


financial
 crisis.
 So,
 it's
 always
 been
 a


mystery
 to
 me
 why
 the
 president
 would


even
 consider
 Kevin
 Walsh.
 Obviously,


the
 president
 likes
 uh
 low
 interest


rates.
 Kevin
 Walsh
 obviously
 lifelong


hawk.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know
 as
 I've
 looked


into
 this,
 you
 know,
 listened
 to
 many


people
 and
 as
 far
 as
 I
 know,
 nobody


knows.
 So,
 it's
 just
 one
 of
 the


mysteries
 of
 the
 universe.
 But
 at
 the


moment,
 though,
 it
 seems
 like
 he's
 going


to
 be
 the
 front
 runner.
 The
 assumption


of
 course
 is
 that
 in
 order
 to
 get
 where


he
 is
 today,
 he
 made
 all
 sorts
 of


promises
 to
 the
 president
 that
 he's


going
 to
 cut
 interest
 rates.
 I
 think
 the


argument
 the
 um
 going
 forward
 is
 going


to
 be
 that
 we
 have
 an
 AI
 productivity


boom
 that's
 disinflationary.
 So
 it's


okay
 to
 cut
 rates
 and
 to
 be
 clear
 there


are
 more
 members
 on
 the
 FOMC
 that
 are


increasingly
 u
 sympathetic
 to
 this


argument.
 So
 that
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 the


case
 that
 if
 he
 becomes
 fed
 share
 that


he'll
 probably
 make.
 Now
 this
 hasset


being
 out
 out
 of
 the
 running
 had
 a
 very


distinct
 impact
 on
 the
 markets.
 If
 you


look
 at
 the
 Treasury
 yield
 curve,
 you


can
 see
 yields
 moved
 up
 pretty


significantly
 across
 the
 curve,


including
 in
 the
 long
 end.
 As
 I


discussed
 during
 my
 Christmas
 episode,


interest
 rates
 are
 largely
 the
 expected


path
 of
 Fed
 policy.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 an


Uber
 Dove,
 someone
 who's
 going
 to
 just


go
 there
 and
 just
 cut
 rates
 to


ridiculous
 levels,
 the
 entire
 interest


rate
 curve
 shifts
 lower,
 including
 the


long
 end.
 Now,
 there
 are
 people
 who


think
 that,
 hey,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 dovish


Fed,
 the
 long
 end
 will
 blow
 out
 because


everyone
 will
 be
 afraid
 of
 inflation.


That
 is
 a
 reasonable
 theory
 of
 how
 the


world
 works.
 The
 way
 you
 know
 if
 it's


right
 or
 not
 is
 that
 you
 take
 your


mental
 model
 and
 you
 test
 it
 against


data.
 And
 the
 data
 on
 Friday
 clearly


shows
 that
 that's
 not
 how
 the
 world


works.
 We
 had
 a
 super
 doubbish
 guy
 out


of
 the
 running.
 So
 on
 the
 margins,
 the


Fed
 became
 more
 hawkish.
 And
 so
 when
 the


Fed
 becomes
 more
 hawkish,
 what
 happened?


The
 long
 end
 sold
 off,
 right?
 Rates
 are


largely
 the
 expected
 path
 of
 Fed
 policy.


Now
 that
 also
 had
 implications
 across


other
 assets
 as
 well.
 We
 saw
 equity


markets
 tumble
 and
 we
 saw
 trades
 that


were
 very
 sensitive
 to
 the
 quoteunquote


debasement
 trade
 also
 do
 very
 poorly.


Gold
 and
 silver
 had
 a
 negative
 knee-jerk


reaction.
 Now
 again
 I
 think
 everyone


knows
 that
 whoever
 becomes
 fed
 chair
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 pretty
 dovish
 person.


That's
 kind
 of the
 bargain
 he
 has
 to


make.
 Uh
 but
 among
 the
 fed
 the
 choices


to
 be
 a
 fed
 chair
 has
 it
 was
 perceived


to
 be
 the
 most
 dovish
 and
 now
 it
 looks


like
 he's
 out
 of
 the
 running.
 Although,


you
 know,
 maybe
 the
 market's
 reaction


might
 have
 changed
 the
 F
 president's


perspective
 a
 little
 bit.
 Nothing
 is


final
 until
 it's
 final.
 Uh,
 Secretary


Basson
 seems
 to
 suggest
 that
 we
 may
 get


announcement
 next
 week.
 So,
 it's


definitely
 something
 worth
 watching.


All right.
 The
 second
 thing
 we
 want
 to


talk
 about
 is
 the
 twilight
 of
 the


central
 banks.
 Now


last
 weekend
 J
 Pal
 was
 basically


you
 know
 very
 very
 blunt
 in
 his
 press


conference
 that
 he
 recorded
 and
 just
 uh


disseminated
 on
 on
 the
 Fed
 website.
 The


threat
 of
 criminal
 charges
 is
 a


consequence
 of
 the
 Federal
 Reserve


setting
 interest
 rates
 based
 on
 our
 best


assessment
 of
 what
 will
 serve
 the
 public


rather
 than
 following
 the
 preferences
 of


the
 president.


This
 is
 about
 whether
 the
 Fed
 will
 be


able
 to
 continue
 to
 set
 interest
 rates


based
 on
 evidence
 and
 economic


conditions
 or
 whether
 instead
 monetary


policy
 will
 be
 directed
 by
 political


pressure
 or
 intimidation.


So
 basically
 Jpal
 is
 just
 kind
 of
 sick


of
 all
 this
 uh
 all
 the
 badgering
 the


Trump
 administration
 has
 been
 doing.


Remember
 earlier
 u
 a
 few
 months
 ago
 we


had
 President
 Trump
 make
 a
 visit
 to
 uh


to
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 in
 a
 hard
 hat


with
 J.
 Powell
 and
 together
 they
 were


going
 over
 construction
 cost
 overruns
 or


the
 president
 was
 expressing
 his
 dis


displeasure
 but
 also
 gave
 J.
 Pow
 a
 pat


on
 the
 back
 and
 asked
 him
 to
 cut


interest
 rates.
 And
 of
 course
 the


president
 has
 also
 you
 know
 filed


lawsuits
 against
 Lisa
 Cook
 trying
 to
 get


her
 out
 of
 office
 and
 so
 forth.
 So,
 the


White
 House
 has
 been
 very
 aggressive
 in


trying
 to
 control
 the
 Fed,
 trying
 to
 get


the
 Fed
 to
 cut
 rates,
 but
 it's
 never


really
 gone
 out
 and
 just
 said
 that
 we


want
 to
 not
 have
 independent
 monetary


policy.
 Right?
 Everyone
 uh
 at
 the
 Fed


there,
 at
 the
 White
 House,
 would
 just


say
 we
 love
 independent
 monetary
 policy.


It's
 great.
 By
 the
 way,
 we
 would
 like
 to


have
 control
 of
 the
 Fed
 and
 we
 would


like
 the
 Fed
 to
 cut
 interest
 rates.
 So,


it's
 very
 obvious
 what
 they're
 trying
 to


do.
 and
 J.
 Pow
 uh
 basically
 just
 out
 in


the
 open
 said
 that
 the
 president
 is


trying
 to
 control
 the
 Fed.
 This
 is
 what


this
 is
 really
 about.
 And
 he's
 trying
 to


build
 support
 to
 see
 if
 people
 can
 stand


up
 with
 him.
 Now,
 there's
 reporting
 that


suggests
 that
 J.
 Pow
 was
 basically


calling
 in
 favors.
 He
 has
 been


cultivating
 relationships
 with
 many


congressmen
 throughout
 the
 years
 and
 we


did
 see
 some
 come
 out
 and
 support
 him.


Um
 he
 also
 seems
 to
 have
 um
 rallied
 the


troops
 across
 the
 world
 where
 we
 have
 a


joint
 statement
 by
 many
 foreign
 central


banks
 all
 coming
 out
 to
 support
 monetary


policy
 independence.


So
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 what
 happened
 and


you
 know
 I
 think
 JPA
 was
 completely


right
 that
 we
 are
 at
 a
 point
 where


what's
 really
 happening
 is
 that
 there
 is


an
 ongoing
 debate
 uh
 that
 is
 happening


in
 in
 the
 sphere
 as
 to
 whether
 or
 not
 uh


monetary
 policy
 should
 be
 independent


and
 if
 it
 is
 independent
 just
 how
 much


independence
 it
 should
 have.


Now
 before
 we
 continue,
 I'd
 like
 to


preface
 this
 by
 just
 thinking
 making
 an


observation.
 So
 uh
 everyone
 understands


the
 world
 through
 mental
 models.
 Now


some
 of
 us
 build
 our
 mental
 models
 from


what
 we
 observe
 in
 life
 and
 some
 of
 us


receive
 them
 by
 what
 we
 study
 in
 books.


Now
 mental
 models
 are
 things
 are


observations
 of
 of
 the
 world
 and
 some
 of


them
 are
 durable
 like
 they
 don't
 change


and
 some
 of
 them
 uh
 become
 wrong
 over


time.
 So
 for
 example,
 if
 you
 make
 an


observation
 about
 physics,
 you
 know,
 if


I
 drop
 a
 rocket,
 it'll
 fall
 to
 the


ground.
 That's
 a
 physical
 law
 thing.


That's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 very
 durable
 model


because
 physical
 laws
 don't
 really


change.


Now
 if
 you
 make
 if
 you
 have
 a
 mental


model
 on
 something
 that's
 more
 of
 a


social
 phenomenon
 that's
 something
 that


could
 change
 over
 time
 uh
 because
 things


change
 with
 culture
 with
 regulation
 with


technology
 and
 so
 forth.
 Uh
 for
 example


a
 popular
 mental
 model
 is
 to
 say
 hey
 we


want
 to
 buy
 stocks
 that
 are
 quote


unquote
 cheap
 and
 sell
 stocks
 that
 are


quote
 unquote
 expensive
 right
 value


investing
 that
 is
 a
 mental
 model
 that


was
 successful
 say
 in
 the
 70s
 and
 80s.


uh
 but
 then
 if
 you
 look
 at
 what
 happened


over
 the
 past
 few
 decades
 very


unsuccessful.


So
 what
 happened
 was
 that
 things
 that


are
 expensive
 became
 even
 more
 expensive


and
 guys
 who
 were
 practicing
 value


investing
 uh
 they
 basically
 did
 very


well
 underperformed
 the
 markets
 uh
 got


fired
 lost
 assets
 and
 so
 forth.
 So
 there


are
 not
 very
 many
 value
 managers
 today


because
 the
 mental
 model
 that
 they
 had


once
 worked
 stopped
 working
 and
 they


they
 um
 uh
 is
 basically
 wrong
 and
 know


some
 people
 still
 read
 about
 this
 in


textbooks
 continue
 to
 um
 assert
 that


it's
 true
 but
 it's
 it's
 very
 obvious
 if


you
 look
 at
 things
 like
 you
 know
 Tesla


or
 Palenteer
 or
 whoever
 has
 been
 doing


very
 well
 the
 past
 few
 years
 value


investing
 doesn't
 work.
 Another
 popular


mental
 model,
 of
 course,
 is
 what
 we
 just


discussed.


If
 you
 cut
 interest
 rates
 a
 lot,
 uh,


long
 will
 blow
 out.
 Again,
 that's
 not


how
 the
 world
 works.
 That's
 doesn't


work.
 Maybe
 it
 worked
 in
 the
 80s
 when


boomers
 were
 talking
 about
 this,
 but


that's
 not
 how
 it
 works
 now.
 Another


popular
 mental
 model,
 if
 the
 central


bank
 cuts
 rates
 too
 much,
 we'll
 have


inflation
 roaring
 back.
 Well,
 you
 know,


that's
 what
 we
 were
 thinking
 after
 the


great
 financial
 crisis
 in
 2008,
 right?


uh
 central
 bank
 cut
 rates
 to
 zero
 doing


quantitative
 easing.
 Some
 central
 banks


even
 cut
 rates
 to
 negative
 and
 after


year
 after
 year
 for
 over
 a
 decade
 you


couldn't
 find
 inflation
 anywhere.


So
 that
 was
 a
 mental
 model
 sounded


totally
 reasonable
 probably
 would
 have


worked
 in
 the
 80s
 or
 something
 like
 that


but
 did
 not
 work
 at
 that
 time
 and
 maybe


doesn't
 work
 today.
 So
 we
 have
 to
 be


mindful
 when
 we
 have
 mental
 models
 that


are
 not
 that
 are
 like
 based
 on
 social


phenomena
 rather
 than
 physical
 reality


because
 sometimes
 those
 mental
 models


become
 obsolete.
 A
 very
 popular
 mental


model
 today
 is
 central
 bank


independence.
 Thinking
 of
 course
 is
 that


if
 the
 central
 banks
 are
 not
 independent


we'll
 have
 hyperinflation
 turning
 to


Turkey
 and
 it
 will
 be
 the
 end
 of
 the


republic.
 So
 if
 you
 just
 do
 a
 little


bit,
 just
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 research,
 you


can
 see
 that's
 just
 not
 true
 because


central
 bank
 independence
 is
 actually


kind
 of
 a
 fad.
 It's
 something
 that
 just


started
 a
 few
 decades
 ago.
 The
 UK
 didn't


have
 it
 until
 the
 n
 late
 1990s
 and


France
 also
 until
 the
 until
 the
 1990s.


So
 it's
 something
 that
 countries
 can


function
 without.


If
 you
 look
 across
 the
 ocean
 to
 China,


which
 uh
 becoming
 a
 manufacturing


superpower,
 they
 do
 not
 have
 independent


monetary
 policy.


And
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 we
 had
 we


didn't
 have
 independent
 monetary
 policy


until
 the
 1950s.
 And
 before
 then,
 the


central
 bank's
 job
 was
 basically
 to


finance
 the
 government.
 So
 central
 bank


independence
 is
 basically
 a
 social


arrangement
 that
 suited
 a
 particular


era.
 Sometimes
 it
 works,
 sometimes
 it


doesn't.
 Sometimes
 we
 have
 it,
 sometimes


we
 don't.
 It's
 like
 any
 other
 social


arrangement.
 Sometimes
 countries
 that


are
 capitalist
 become
 socialist
 become


communist.
 Sometimes
 they
 go
 from


communist
 to
 socialist
 to
 capitalist.


That's
 the
 story
 of
 China.
 Sometimes


countries
 go
 from
 dictatorship
 to


democracy
 and
 back
 to
 uh
 dictatorship.


That
 happens
 in
 many
 Latin
 American


countries.
 So
 this
 is
 something
 that
 is


these
 these
 mental
 models,
 they're


fluid.
 They
 are
 not
 a
 physical
 truth.


So
 it's
 very
 clear
 that
 we
 are
 moving


into
 a
 different
 institutional


arrangement
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 central


bank.
 President
 Trump
 is
 putting
 a
 lot


of
 pressure
 on
 the
 Fed,
 but
 it's
 not


just
 something
 that
 it's
 unique
 to
 the


US.
 You
 see
 the
 similar
 thing
 in
 Japan


as
 well.
 And
 I
 don't
 get
 the
 sense
 that


there's
 enough
 political
 pressure
 to


protect
 the
 status
 quo.
 You
 do
 have
 some


lawmakers
 rallying
 to
 Cher
 Powell,
 but


their
 rally
 sounds
 to
 me
 more
 like,
 you


know,
 Jay
 Powell,
 he's
 a
 good
 guy.
 You


know,
 he's
 not
 a
 criminal.
 He
 probably


kept
 interest
 rates
 too
 high.
 Probably


didn't
 do
 a
 great
 job,
 but
 he's
 not
 a


criminal.
 You
 you
 you
 shouldn't
 have
 a


criminal
 indictment
 against
 him.
 So,


it's
 more
 on
 that
 rather
 than
 the


overall
 idea.


Um,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 whole


reason
 for
 this
 investigation
 was
 to
 pro


is
 to
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 quoteunquote


cause
 to
 be
 able
 to
 potentially
 fire
 J.


Powell
 if
 he
 doesn't
 leave
 the
 Fed
 after


his
 chairmanship.


That's
 just
 my
 speculation.
 Uh,
 but
 in


any
 case,
 so
 you
 have
 this
 huge
 wall
 of


international
 support
 for
 uh,
 central


bank
 independence.
 But


the
 thing
 is
 I
 don't
 get
 the
 sense
 that


the
 public
 has
 as
 much
 confidence
 in
 our


institutions
 and
 in
 the
 economics


establishment
 as
 it
 would
 say
 a
 decade


ago.
 Say
 around
 the
 great
 financial


crisis
 if
 you
 had
 all
 these
 central


banks
 or
 econ
 Nobels
 or
 whatever
 come


and
 make
 these
 big
 joint
 statements
 that


they
 would
 put
 in
 the
 New
 York
 Times
 or


something
 like
 that
 that
 would
 have
 a


big
 impact.


But
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years,
 the
 public


support
 of
 central
 banks
 has
 I
 think


weakened
 because
 for
 obvious
 reasons
 we


had
 one
 of
 the
 greatest
 inflation
 surges


in
 in
 decades
 and
 also
 of
 the
 economics


profession
 in
 general
 who
 of
 course


promised
 you
 inflation
 would
 be


transitory
 then
 promised
 you
 that


tariffs
 would
 devastate
 the
 global


economy
 and
 and
 many
 made
 many
 such


promises
 throughout
 the
 past
 decade.
 So


it
 doesn't
 seem
 that
 the
 economics


profession
 offers
 insight
 in
 how
 the


world
 works.
 it
 doesn't
 seem
 like
 the


central
 banks
 actually
 do
 a
 good
 job
 and


so
 there's
 not
 as
 much
 public
 support


for
 these
 institutions


and
 I
 think
 that
 is
 that
 that
 is
 one


part
 but
 I
 think
 the
 more
 fundamental


reason
 is
 that
 this
 institutional


arrangement
 of
 having
 a
 central
 bank


doesn't
 make
 sense
 for
 two
 reasons
 one


is
 that
 there's
 fiscal
 dominance
 right


so
 we
 didn't
 have
 inflation
 for
 a
 long


time
 we
 started
 to
 have
 it
 when
 the


governments
 began
 to
 spend
 enormous


amounts
 of
 and
 they
 continue
 to
 spend


enormous
 amounts
 of
 money
 not
 just
 in


the
 US
 but
 in
 governments
 across
 the


world.
 So
 inflation
 is
 increasingly


becoming
 a
 fiscal
 phenomenon
 and
 if
 you


have
 if
 that's
 the
 case
 and
 that


definitely
 seems
 to
 be
 the
 trend
 then


you
 know
 you're
 central
 banking
 is
 just


not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 control


inflation.
 What's
 the
 point
 of
 toggling


interest
 rates
 up
 or
 down
 when
 the


government
 is
 just
 going
 to
 continue
 to


spend?


The
 inflation
 mandate
 in
 that
 case
 has


to
 go
 back
 to
 Congress
 because
 Congress


is
 the
 primary
 driver
 of
 it
 as
 it
 is


today.
 It's
 the
 Fed
 just
 simply
 becomes


a
 scapegoat
 for
 the
 actions
 of
 Congress


and
 so
 we
 don't
 really
 fix
 the


underlying
 problem.


The
 second
 thing
 that
 this
 arrangement


doesn't
 make
 sense
 is
 that
 one
 of
 the


biggest
 social
 problems
 we
 have
 today
 is


wealth
 inequality
 and
 that
 is
 a
 direct


consequence
 of
 monetary
 policy.
 Now,


Cher
 Bernaki
 during
 the
 great
 recession


basically
 explicitly
 told
 you
 that
 one


of
 the
 things
 that
 he's
 trying
 to
 do
 is


to
 have
 a
 wealth
 effect
 whereby
 you
 know


using
 monetary
 policy
 which
 maybe
 not


super
 effective
 on
 the
 real
 economy
 very


effective
 on
 the
 financial
 assets
 he


wants
 to
 pump
 up
 financial
 assets
 so


that
 there'll
 be
 more
 demand
 and
 that


will
 keep
 the
 economy
 humming
 and
 that


basically
 evolved
 to
 where
 the
 we
 have


the
 K-shaped
 recovery
 today
 where
 people


have
 assets
 are
 doing
 very
 well
 and


people
 who
 don't
 have
 assets
 are
 not


doing
 well.
 On
 the
 aggregate,
 this
 makes


the
 US
 economy
 look
 good,
 right?
 Huge


amounts
 of
 uh
 rich
 people
 spending
 their


asset
 wealth,
 keeping
 the
 economy


humming.


But
 underneath
 though,
 you
 can
 see
 that


you
 have
 a
 big
 divide
 between
 people
 who


have
 assets
 who
 don't.
 And
 so
 people
 who


don't
 can
 basically
 have
 never
 afford
 a


home,
 very
 difficult
 to
 afford
 a
 home,


and
 are
 basically
 going
 to
 be
 surfs
 for


their
 entire
 life.
 for
 the
 people
 who


had
 assets
 just
 by
 being
 lucky,
 buying


early,
 uh
 maybe
 being
 a
 boomer,
 they


continue
 to
 do
 very
 well.
 Now,
 that
 is
 a


fundamental
 distributional
 issue
 that
 um


that
 I
 think
 if
 you
 want
 to
 be
 in
 a


democratic
 society,
 the
 public
 has
 to


have
 some
 say
 in.
 And
 even
 even
 if
 you


think
 that
 the
 public
 shouldn't
 have
 say


in,
 you're
 becoming
 the
 people
 are


becoming
 increasingly
 discontent.
 And
 so


they're
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 I
 think


President
 Trump
 can
 win.
 He
 promised


change.
 Obama
 promised
 change
 as
 well.


Trump
 actually
 is
 changing
 things
 a
 lot.


And
 so
 that's
 kind
 of
 the


political
 mechanism
 why
 uh
 this
 is
 not


sustainable.
 And
 so
 this
 is
 going
 to


change.
 And
 one
 other
 thing
 to
 make
 note


is
 that
 as
 governments
 continue
 to


borrow
 more
 and
 spend
 more,
 interest


expense
 is
 becoming
 a
 bigger
 part
 of


their
 budget.
 And
 that's
 true
 across
 the


world.
 And
 so
 interest
 rate
 policy
 is


increasingly
 becoming
 fiscal
 policy.
 And


I
 think
 everyone
 agrees
 that
 fiscal


policy
 is
 something
 that
 should
 have


democratic
 accountability.
 So
 in
 any


case,
 the
 political
 will
 and
 strength
 is


there
 to
 change
 the
 central
 bank's


relationship


and
 I
 think
 the
 underlying
 realities
 are


there
 as
 well.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 we
 are


definitely
 at
 the
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 uh


Federal
 Reserve
 independence
 and
 it's


going
 to
 happen
 to
 many
 other
 countries


as
 well
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 okay


because
 um


guys
 you
 still
 have
 political


accountability.
 Inflation
 is
 unpopular.


If
 we
 do
 have
 a
 surge
 in
 inflation
 you


can
 always
 vote
 the
 guy
 out
 of
 office
 as


was
 what
 happened
 in
 2024.
 All
 right
 so


that's
 all
 I
 prepared
 for
 today.
 Next


week,
 maybe
 we'll
 get
 a
 new
 Fed
 share


announcement.
 That
 would
 be
 very


exciting.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 it
 uh
 next


week.
 All
 right,
 talk
 to
 you
 then.
