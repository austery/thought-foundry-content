You
 actually
 you
 start
 your
 talk
 by
 u


mentioning
 that
 you
 have
 been
 called


America's
 worst
 mom
 after
 you
 let
 your


nine-year-old
 ride
 the
 New
 York
 City


subway
 alone
 and
 you
 embraced
 that


title.
 So


>> while


maybe
 not
 initially
 um
 but
 so
 I
 mean


when
 you
 look
 back
 at
 that
 moment
 what


do
 you
 think
 um
 struck
 a
 cultural
 nerve?


Um,


>> yeah.


>> So,
 that
 he's
 27
 now,
 so
 I've
 been


thinking
 about
 it
 for
 a
 while.
 And
 I


think,
 um,
 two
 things
 struck
 a
 nerve


because
 I
 looked
 at
 older
 columns
 of


mine
 where
 I
 had
 let
 my
 kids
 play
 in
 the


courtyard
 without
 me.
 I
 let
 them
 take


elevators
 without
 me.
 I
 let
 them
 go,


they're
 two
 boys,
 let
 them
 go
 to
 the


men's
 room
 without
 me,
 obviously,
 and


nobody
 cared
 about
 any
 of
 those
 columns.


So,
 I
 think,
 um,
 by
 writing
 about
 my
 kid


taking
 the
 subway
 by
 himself,
 uh,
 it
 was


basically
 the
 subway.
 Hey,
 New
 York
 City


subway
 does
 not
 have
 a
 great
 reputation


and
 uh
 people
 think
 it's
 hell
 and
 why


would
 you
 send
 your
 kid
 down
 to
 hell
 at


least
 without
 you?
 And
 then
 um
 I
 think


it
 wasn't
 just
 me
 saying
 you
 know
 kids


need
 independence.
 It
 was
 me
 actually


doing
 it
 pedal
 to
 the
 metal
 and
 and
 the


fact
 that
 he
 loved
 it
 I
 think
 was
 also


um
 maybe
 just
 interesting.
 It
 wasn't


something
 that
 we
 did
 because
 he
 should


do
 it.
 He
 should
 learn.
 He
 should
 be


tough
 toughened
 up.
 It
 was
 just
 he


wanted
 to
 take
 the
 subway
 by
 himself
 and


we
 let
 him.
 It's
 like,
 oh
 yeah,
 kids


have
 things
 that
 they
 want
 to
 do
 on


their
 own
 and
 maybe
 we
 should
 listen
 to


them
 and
 see
 what
 happens.
 So,
 but
 I


think
 it's
 the
 subway.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 and
 all
 these
 years


later,
 it's
 still
 something
 that
 people


are
 still,
 it
 seems
 like,
 obsessed
 with


and
 concerned
 by
 this
 idea
 of
 letting


kids
 go
 on
 their
 own.
 And
 so,
 could
 you,


I
 guess,
 talk
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 this


for
 those
 people
 who
 are
 new
 to
 your


work?
 What
 exactly
 does
 freerange
 kids


mean?


I
 knew
 you
 were
 going
 to
 ask
 and
 frankly


I've
 been
 asked
 this
 for
 a
 while
 and
 I
 I


never
 have
 a
 great
 pathy
 explanation
 but


it
 is
 basically
 believing
 that
 kids
 can


do
 some
 things
 on
 their
 own
 the
 way
 most


of
 today's
 parents
 and
 certainly
 the


grandparents
 remember
 as
 kids
 what


what's
 strange
 uh
 about
 childhood
 today


is
 the
 fact
 that
 kids
 do
 almost
 nothing


on
 their
 own
 and
 I
 I
 have
 some


statistics
 we
 did
 a
 a
 study
 with
 the


Harris
 people
 the
 Harris
 pole
 people
 and


they
 found
 that
 um
 the
 major
 Majority
 of


kids
 aged
 8
 to
 12
 have
 um
 rarely
 or


never
 walked
 around
 their
 own


neighborhood
 without
 an
 adult.
 More
 than


50%
 had
 never
 gone
 to
 another
 aisle
 at


the
 grocery
 without
 an
 adult.
 Um
 25%


weren't
 allowed
 to
 play
 on
 their
 own


front
 lawn.
 So
 it's
 like
 why
 have
 a


front
 lawn,
 you
 know,
 if
 kids
 aren't


allowed
 there.
 So,
 uh,
 also
 there
 was


this
 really
 amazing
 piece
 done
 in
 I
 I


know
 it's
 the
 Daily
 Mail,
 uh,
 but


nonetheless,
 the
 Daily
 Mail
 did
 an
 an


incredible
 story,
 uh,
 several
 years


back,
 and
 it
 was
 called
 How
 Children


Lost
 the
 Right
 to
 Rome
 in
 four


generations.
 And
 it
 interviewed,
 it
 had


a
 map,
 but
 it
 interviewed
 a
 great


grandpa,
 88,
 how
 what
 had
 he
 done
 as
 a


kid?
 He'd
 he'd
 gone
 six
 miles
 in
 any


direction.
 And
 then
 the
 grandpa,
 66,
 had


gone
 um
 about
 a
 mile
 to
 the
 fishing
 hole


or
 and
 then
 the
 mother
 who
 was
 in
 her


40s
 had
 walked
 half
 a
 mile
 to
 school
 and


her
 son
 who
 was
 eight
 was
 not
 allowed


and
 I
 can't
 remember
 if
 it's
 not
 allowed


off
 his
 block
 or
 not
 allowed
 off
 his


yard.
 Um,
 but
 the
 the
 map
 that
 showed


this
 just
 showed
 really
 childhood


shrinking
 and
 freerange
 kids
 is
 trying


to
 make
 it
 easy,
 normal,
 and
 legal
 uh
 to


to
 widen
 that
 again
 to
 trust
 kids
 with


some
 independence
 and
 and
 that's
 what


LetGrow,
 the
 nonprofit
 that
 grew
 out
 of


Freerange
 Kids,
 is
 is
 working
 on.


And
 we'll
 we'll
 definitely
 talk
 more


about
 some
 of
 the
 work
 you're
 doing
 with


Let
 Grow,
 but
 before
 we
 get
 into
 that,


I'd
 love
 to
 just
 keep
 going
 on
 this


thread
 around
 how
 independence
 for


children
 has
 has
 really
 begun
 to
 shrink.


Why
 Why
 do
 you
 think
 modern
 parenting


has
 become
 so
 focused
 on
 safety
 and


control?


>> This
 my
 favorite
 topic
 and
 we
 don't
 have


24
 hours,
 we
 just
 have
 one.
 Um,
 I
 would


say
 that
 the
 change
 really
 began
 uh
 in


earnest
 in
 the
 80s
 and
 into
 the
 90s.
 And


a
 couple
 things
 changed
 back
 then
 that


were
 significant.
 One
 is
 that
 we
 got


cable
 television
 in
 the
 80s,
 which
 meant


that
 we
 suddenly
 had
 a
 24-hour
 news


cycle,
 which
 had
 never
 been
 the
 case


before.
 Um,
 and
 of
 course
 if
 you
 have
 to


keep
 people
 glued
 to
 the
 screen
 for
 all


those
 hours,
 you
 have
 to
 find
 very


compelling
 and
 I
 would
 say
 very


upsetting
 content
 as
 we've
 learned
 from


later
 on
 with
 the
 internet.
 And
 so


that's
 when
 we
 started
 to
 sort
 of
 um


obsess
 about
 stranger
 danger
 and
 also


there
 were
 two
 very
 high-profile


kidnappings
 um
 in
 New
 York,
 my
 city
 in


1979.
 A
 boy
 named
 Eton
 Pates
 was
 taken


from
 a
 bus
 stop
 um
 and
 never
 seen
 again.


And
 what
 was
 interesting
 about
 that


case,
 aside
 from
 utter
 tragedy,
 is
 that


the
 working
 assumption
 on
 the
 part
 of


the
 public
 uh
 at
 the
 beginning
 was
 that


some
 lovelororn
 lady
 had
 seen
 this
 cute


little
 kid
 and
 taken
 him
 home
 to
 raise


as
 her
 own.
 So
 we
 weren't
 thinking
 at


all
 about
 predators.
 And
 predators
 then


were
 like
 lions
 and
 owls.
 And
 and
 so
 it


was
 only
 gradually
 as
 word
 got
 out
 maybe


from
 the
 police
 and
 from
 the
 news
 that


well
 maybe
 it
 wasn't
 a
 lady,
 maybe
 it


wasn't
 taken
 home
 to
 raise
 that
 people


became
 became
 just
 shocked
 that
 there


would
 be
 this
 weird
 and
 horrible
 and


disgusting
 and
 upsetting
 crime.
 And
 then


when
 it
 happened
 to
 uh
 Adam
 Walsh
 was


taken
 from
 outside
 of
 a
 Sears
 in
 Florida


in
 1982,
 there
 was
 a
 a
 miniseries
 done


on
 him
 that
 broke
 all
 ratings
 records.


And
 you
 know
 the
 news
 and
 the
 media
 are


there
 to
 make
 money,
 right?
 Not
 just
 to


inform
 you
 and
 help
 you,
 but
 really
 to


make
 money.
 And
 when
 they
 saw
 that
 this


is
 what
 really
 captivated
 audiences
 the


most,
 they
 said,
 "Get
 me
 more
 of
 these.


Don't
 get
 me
 Don't
 steal
 more
 children.


get
 me
 more
 content
 like
 this
 because


this
 the
 the
 appetite
 for
 this
 has
 been


unending.
 And
 we
 know
 that
 because
 to


this
 day,
 Law
 and
 Order,
 I
 think,
 has


been
 on
 for
 like
 25
 or
 30
 years.
 And


every
 day
 people
 are
 tuning
 in
 to
 see


just
 the
 most
 depraved
 and
 upsetting


crimes.
 And
 you
 know,
 you
 breathe
 these


in
 and
 gradually
 your
 your
 lungs
 fill


with
 this
 despair
 and
 what
 seemed
 to
 be,


you
 know,
 almost
 unheard
 of
 in
 the
 Eton


Page
 case
 in
 1979
 becomes
 something
 like


the
 the
 same
 Harris
 poll
 interviewed


parents
 and
 what
 was
 it?
 It
 was
 50%
 of


parents.
 No,
 when
 asked
 what
 would


happen
 if
 there
 were
 two
 kids
 aged
 10,


10,
 double
 digits
 playing
 at
 the
 park


together,
 what
 is
 likely
 to
 happen?
 and


50%
 of
 the
 parents
 said
 they
 were
 likely


to
 be
 kidnapped.
 Um,
 that's
 that's


wildly
 out
 of
 whack
 with
 reality,
 thank


God.
 But
 that's
 the
 result
 of
 this


constant
 drum
 beat
 of
 terror
 and
 despair


that
 we
 are
 marinating
 in
 thanks
 to
 the


media.


>> So
 when
 we
 think
 about
 this
 then
 now


everyone
 has
 decided
 keep
 them
 close,


don't
 let
 them
 roam
 as
 you
 know
 as
 you


say.
 What
 are
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the


hidden
 costs
 of
 of
 this
 of


overprotective
 parenting
 for
 for
 both


parents
 and
 kids?


>> Well,
 let's
 talk
 about
 kids
 first.
 Um,


and
 I
 feel
 bad
 because
 my
 TED
 talk
 was


really
 funny
 and
 now
 we're
 getting


really
 somber,
 but
 the
 sad
 thing
 for


kids
 is
 that
 they
 are
 sad.
 They
 are


getting
 anxious
 and
 depressed.
 And
 we


all
 know
 this,
 but
 um
 people
 think
 it's


since
 COVID
 or
 since
 phones
 or
 whatever,


since
 No
 Child
 Left
 Behind,
 it's
 really


been
 decades
 in
 the
 making.
 Um,
 one
 of


my
 LetGrow
 co-founders
 is
 a
 man
 named


Peter
 Gray.
 Uh,
 he's
 a
 professor
 of


psychology
 at
 Boston
 College.
 And
 he
 did


a
 a
 big
 long
 study
 that
 was
 published
 in


the
 Journal
 of
 Pediatrics
 two
 years
 ago.


And
 it
 showed
 that
 over
 the
 decades,


like
 from
 the
 50s
 to
 now,
 as
 kids


independence,
 ability
 to
 roam,
 problem


solve,
 play
 on
 their
 own
 has
 gone
 down,


their
 anxiety
 and
 depression
 have
 been


going
 up.
 And
 he
 argues
 that
 it's
 not


just
 correlation,
 it's
 causation.
 Then


you
 could
 sort
 of
 understand
 that


because
 if
 you
 were
 in
 a
 job
 and
 you


were
 micromanaged
 all
 the
 time
 and


somebody
 was
 saying
 Whitney
 why
 don't


you
 try
 it
 this
 way
 Whitney
 that's
 good


but
 maybe
 you
 want
 to
 think
 about
 this


Whitney
 will
 you
 have
 this
 to
 me
 this
 is


you
 know
 by
 502
 today
 you
 know
 nobody


wants
 to
 be
 micromanaged
 and
 childhood


has
 become
 micromanaged
 and


the
 other
 thing
 Peter
 Gray
 explains


which
 I
 think
 is
 really
 right
 is
 that
 um


there's
 something
 called
 an
 internal


locus
 of
 control
 versus
 external
 locus


of
 control
 and
 what
 external
 is
 when


somebody
 else
 is
 deciding
 how
 you
 spend


your
 day
 and
 whether
 you're
 doing
 it


good
 enough
 and
 gives
 you
 all
 this


feedback
 and
 tells
 you
 what
 you're
 going


to
 do
 next.
 And
 internal
 is
 when
 you


feel
 like,
 you
 know,
 I
 really
 feel
 like


going
 and
 looking
 for
 bugs
 today
 or
 I


just
 want
 to
 get
 better
 at
 my
 free


throws
 or
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 on
 my


skateboard.
 When
 you
 have
 an
 intrinsic,


well,
 internal
 locus
 of
 control
 means
 an


intrinsic
 so
 hard
 to
 say
 um
 desire
 to
 do


something
 and
 you
 go
 and
 do
 it,
 you
 feel


like
 you
 can
 handle
 things
 even
 if
 you


fall
 off
 the
 skateboard.
 even
 if
 you


don't
 find
 a
 bug,
 which
 would
 be
 odd.


Um,
 so
 when
 you
 have
 this
 feeling
 like
 I


can
 handle
 things
 and
 people
 trust
 me


and
 if
 things
 go
 wrong,
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 to
 make
 them


better.
 You
 feel
 great.
 You're
 on
 top
 of


the
 world
 and
 we
 have
 taken
 most
 of
 that


out
 of
 children's
 lives
 because
 we're
 so


worried
 about
 them
 that
 we
 do
 everything


with
 them
 and
 for
 them.
 And
 as
 a
 result,


they're
 sort
 of
 they're,
 you
 know,


they're
 like
 they're
 like
 in
 the


passenger
 seat
 of
 their
 lives
 while
 we


very
 smart,
 helpful
 people
 are
 driving


them
 to
 something
 that's
 going
 to
 be


really
 important
 for
 them,
 especially
 if


they're
 trying
 to
 get
 into
 college.


>> And
 I
 I
 love
 in
 the
 in
 the
 talk,
 and
 I
 I


promise
 we're
 gonna
 we
 are
 going
 to
 come


away
 from
 some
 of
 the
 somber
 stuff
 to


the
 light.
 Um
 and
 in
 in
 the
 talk
 you
 say


that
 um
 I
 did
 it
 myself
 are
 both
 uh


childhood's
 magic
 um
 words
 and
 the


original
 anxiety
 buster.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Could
 you
 say
 more
 about


that?
 You
 know
 what
 role
 does
 does


risktaking
 and
 and
 independence
 play
 in


sort
 of
 raising
 resilient
 um
 children?


>> I'd
 say
 it
 plays
 a
 huge
 role.
 And
 you


probably
 remember
 this
 from
 your
 own


childhood.
 Something
 that
 you
 did


yourself
 that
 you
 thought
 was
 a
 little


scary
 or
 you're
 still
 proud
 of
 to
 this


day.
 Sometimes
 I
 ask
 people,
 uh,
 what


did
 you
 do
 as
 a
 kid
 that
 went
 really


wrong?
 And
 I'll
 just
 tell
 you
 one
 quick


story,
 which
 is
 I
 was
 at
 a
 an
 an


education
 conference
 of
 some
 sort,
 and


one
 of
 the
 ladies
 told
 me
 that
 when
 she


was
 a
 kid,
 um,
 she
 and
 her
 friends
 were


riding
 their
 bikes
 down
 this,
 I'm
 sure


it
 seemed
 like
 an
 incredible
 mountain.


It
 was
 probably
 just
 a
 little
 hill,
 but


it
 was
 covered
 with
 um,
 pine
 needles.


And
 when
 she
 went
 down,
 you
 know,
 it
 was


really
 slick
 and
 fast.
 And
 so
 she's


going
 down
 and
 she's
 holding
 on
 to
 the


handle
 brakes
 and
 she
 goes
 like
 this
 to


to
 break
 because
 she's
 at
 the
 bottom
 and


the
 handlebars
 came
 off
 the
 bike.
 So


suddenly
 it's
 like
 ah
 like
 a
 cartoon
 and


she
 had
 a
 split
 second
 to
 decide
 what
 to


do
 and
 she
 threw
 herself
 into
 a
 bush,


right?
 And
 she
 got
 all
 scraped
 off
 and


it
 was
 okay
 and
 she
 put
 the
 handlebars


back
 on.
 She
 kept
 doing
 it
 and
 I
 said,


"Well,
 you
 know,
 well
 what
 did
 you
 tell


your
 parents?"
 and
 she's
 like,
 "I
 didn't


tell
 my
 parents."
 And
 then
 when
 other


people
 in
 the
 audience
 started
 telling


stories
 like
 this
 kid,
 this
 this
 one


guy,
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 principal,
 got


lost
 on
 like
 some
 family
 hike
 and
 he
 had


to
 actually
 hitchhike
 back
 to
 where
 they


were.
 And
 of
 course,
 he
 didn't
 tell
 his


parents.
 And
 and
 some
 guy
 played
 Mumbly


Peg,
 which
 is
 the
 stupidest
 game
 on


earth,
 where
 you
 throw
 a
 knife
 at
 each


other's
 feet.
 And
 of
 course,
 somebody's


foot
 got
 hurt
 and
 they
 like
 hid
 the
 fact


that
 they
 were
 taking
 him
 up
 to
 the


bathroom
 to
 wash
 off
 his
 foot
 and
 get


the
 blood
 down
 the
 drain
 and
 put
 on
 a


band-aid.
 Oh,
 he's
 fine.
 just
 taking
 a


shower,
 you
 know,
 and
 and
 none
 of
 them


had
 told
 their
 parents.
 And
 when
 I
 said


why,
 it
 was
 because
 they
 they
 didn't


want
 their
 parents
 to
 know
 and
 then


therefore
 take
 away
 their
 independence.


So
 their
 independence
 was
 just
 uh
 you


know
 innately
 so
 important
 to
 them
 that


they
 were
 treasuring
 it
 and
 protecting


it
 and
 they
 were
 doing
 two
 things
 at


once.
 They
 were
 protecting
 their


independence
 and
 they
 were
 saying
 to


themselves,
 "Look
 what
 I
 can
 handle."


And
 anxiety
 is
 the
 opposite
 of
 that.


Anxiety
 is
 when
 you
 worry
 like,
 "Oh,
 you


know,
 this
 seems
 hard.
 What
 if
 I
 mess


up?
 If
 I
 mess
 up,
 it'll
 be
 terrible.


I'll
 be
 embarrassed.
 And
 if
 I'm
 hurt,
 it


will
 be
 forever,
 so
 I
 might
 as
 well
 not


do
 it."
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 you,
 Nike
 just


changed
 its
 slogan
 like
 last
 week.
 And


while
 they're
 keeping
 just
 do
 it,
 they


they
 added
 the
 new
 slogan,
 why
 do
 it?


Like,
 why
 do
 it?
 And
 it's
 a
 recognition


that
 kids
 are
 so
 afraid
 of
 messing
 up


because
 they're
 watched
 all
 the
 time.


So,
 there's
 high
 stakes.
 You're
 always


being
 judged.
 You're
 always
 being


protected,
 and
 you
 never
 have
 a
 chance


to
 see
 how
 much
 you
 can
 do.
 So,
 you


finally
 just
 go,
 "Well,
 why
 do
 it?"
 You


know,
 I'll
 look
 stupid.
 Maybe
 somebody


puts
 my,
 you
 know,
 a
 real
 on
 Instagram.


Um,
 maybe
 I
 feel
 bad
 about
 myself.
 Maybe


I'll
 get
 hurt.
 And
 so
 if
 Nike
 is


recognizing
 a
 pervasive
 passivity
 in


kids
 even
 wanting
 to
 play,
 I
 mean
 Nike


is
 about
 playing,
 right?
 Then
 something


has
 gone
 arry.
 And
 so
 if
 you're
 asking


what's
 the
 problem
 in
 in
 the
 culture,


it's
 that
 we're
 taking
 the
 the
 childhood


the
 child
 out
 of
 childhood
 and
 replacing


it
 with
 adult
 oriented,
 adult-run


activities
 and
 adult
 supervised


activities
 to
 the
 point
 where
 kids
 are


like,
 "Okay,
 it's
 yours.
 Tell
 me
 what
 to


do.
 I'll
 do
 it."
 But
 otherwise,
 why
 why


do
 it?


>> Well,
 okay,
 we've
 we've
 set
 the
 stage


now
 for
 why
 this
 think
 thinking
 about


this
 and
 having
 these
 conversations
 with


yourself
 and
 your
 children,
 your


community
 is
 really
 important.
 Um,
 and


our
 member
 audience
 is
 so
 eager
 to
 hear


you
 share
 more
 about
 how
 we
 actually
 do


this.
 So,
 I'm
 going
 to
 integrate
 in
 some


questions
 that
 we're
 getting
 from
 the


members.
 But
 before
 we
 get
 there,
 if
 you


could
 just
 um
 I
 guess
 start
 us
 off
 with


your
 simple
 small
 steps
 for
 how
 people


can
 practically
 begin
 to
 give
 their
 kids


more
 freedom
 without
 feeling
 reckless.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 first
 of
 all,
 it's
 not
 reckless


to
 give
 your
 kids
 some
 freedom.
 I
 would


argue
 that
 it's
 reckless
 not
 to
 give


them
 some
 freedom
 for
 the
 reasons
 we've


already
 discussed.
 But
 I
 recognize
 that


it
 is
 hard
 in
 a
 culture
 that
 says
 like


there
 are
 there
 are
 schools
 that
 won't


let
 the
 kids
 get
 off
 the
 bus
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 unless
 a
 parent
 is
 there
 to


walk
 them
 home.
 And
 it
 could
 be
 two


blocks,
 it
 could
 be
 two
 houses.
 I
 was
 I


was
 actually
 giving
 a
 talk
 in


>> I
 have
 no
 idea
 where
 I
 was.
 Um,
 but
 the


audience
 members
 told
 me
 that
 their


school,
 the
 bus
 stops
 at
 each
 person's


house
 and
 drops
 them
 off
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 driveway
 and
 you
 still
 have
 to
 come


out
 of
 your
 house
 to
 get
 the
 kid.
 You


can't
 wave
 from
 the
 window.
 You
 have
 to


come
 down
 and
 get
 them.
 So,
 this
 is
 a


culture
 that
 is
 demanding
 a
 level
 of


safety
 and
 supervision
 and
 uh,
 you
 know,


help
 for
 the
 kids
 that
 is
 just
 off
 the


charts.
 So,
 I
 don't
 blame
 parents
 for


being
 helicopters
 because
 the
 the


culture
 is
 recommending
 it
 and
 sometimes


often
 enough
 demanding
 it.


>> And
 so,
 you
 know,
 Sketchers
 shoes
 for


kids,
 they
 now
 have
 a
 hole
 in
 underneath


the
 insole
 where
 you
 can
 put
 a
 tracking


device.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 how
 normalized


constant
 supervision
 has
 become.
 But
 the


way
 to
 fight
 it
 is
 the
 easiest
 way
 to
 to


change
 anything
 is
 collectively.
 if


we're
 all
 afraid
 to
 send
 our
 kids


outside,
 you
 know,
 what
 is
 the
 what
 are


the
 other
 parents
 going
 to
 think?
 Is
 it


too
 tough?
 Is
 it
 too
 soon?
 Is
 my
 kid
 too


spacey?
 Is
 to
 have
 everybody
 doing
 it
 at


once.
 And
 so
 that's
 why
 LetGrow,
 the


nonprofit
 that
 grew
 out
 of
 Free
 Range


Kids,
 recommends
 that
 schools
 give
 kids


a
 homework
 assignment
 called
 the
 Let


Grow
 Experience.
 It's
 free
 where
 every


kid
 gets
 the
 homework
 that
 says,
 "Go


home
 and
 do
 something
 new
 on
 your
 own


with
 your
 parents'
 permission,
 but


without
 your
 parents."
 And
 then
 we
 give


a
 list
 of
 giant,
 you
 know,
 giant,
 you


can
 climb
 a
 tree,
 you
 can
 make
 pancakes,


you
 can
 walk
 to
 the
 store,
 whatever
 it


is.
 Um,
 but
 if
 everybody
 is
 doing
 it,


all
 the
 third
 graders
 are,
 you
 know,


getting
 themselves
 to
 their
 guitar


lessons
 or
 picking
 up
 the
 milk
 for


dinner,
 you're
 not
 the
 crazy
 mom
 letting


them
 do
 it
 and
 all
 the
 kids
 are
 talking


to
 each
 other
 and
 all
 the
 parents
 are


talking
 to
 each
 other
 and
 you've


renormalized
 letting
 go.
 But,
 but


letting
 go
 is
 not
 just
 good
 because,


okay,
 they're
 getting
 a
 little


independence,
 maybe
 they're
 less


anxious.
 Letting
 go
 is
 really
 important


because
 it
 rewires
 you,
 the
 parent,


because
 when
 you
 see
 your
 kid
 come
 back


from
 that
 errand
 and
 they
 got
 the
 milk


or
 I
 was
 just
 talking
 to
 a
 lady
 today,


who
 was
 I
 talking
 to
 right
 before
 you,


I'm
 losing
 my
 mind,
 but
 oh,
 she
 let
 her


kid
 go
 into
 the
 grocery
 and
 get
 the


things
 for
 dinner
 and
 he
 came
 out,
 he


was
 six,
 he
 came
 out
 with
 only
 cookies,


right?
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 I
 agree
 with


that.
 I
 think
 that
 makes
 a
 great
 dinner.


But
 um
 she
 was
 a
 little
 disappointed
 but


also
 so
 proud
 because
 he'd
 gone
 in
 and


he
 came
 out
 and
 he
 said,
 "I
 think
 I
 got


the
 exact
 change,
 didn't
 I?"
 And
 then


they're
 looking
 over
 the
 change.
 And
 you


you
 the
 parent,
 you're
 it's
 like
 the


Grinch.
 Your
 heart
 grows
 three
 sizes


when
 you
 see
 your
 kid
 do
 something
 on


their
 own.
 And
 that's
 the
 only
 solution.


You
 almost
 have
 to
 let
 your
 kid
 go
 a


little
 before
 you're
 totally
 ready


because
 you
 will
 be
 ready
 when
 they
 come


home
 and
 they
 will
 come
 home.
 And
 and
 if


they
 screwed
 up,
 that's
 okay,
 too,


because
 then
 you
 realize
 like
 it's
 okay


he
 got
 a
 little
 lost
 or
 he
 only
 bought


the
 cookies
 and
 that's
 okay,
 too.
 And


you
 just
 have
 to
 realize
 that
 this
 level


of
 um
 supervision
 and
 hypervigilance
 is


new
 and
 unnecessary.
 And
 it's
 not
 only
 a


burden
 to
 a
 kid,
 it's
 a
 burden
 to
 you


because
 it
 has
 made
 your
 job
 as
 a
 parent


watching
 every
 single
 second.
 You
 know,


you
 can't
 send
 them
 to
 get
 the
 bananas.


That's
 that's
 too
 much
 to
 ask
 of
 any


parent.
 you
 know,
 the
 the
 the
 the
 birth


rates
 are
 going
 down.
 And
 I
 think
 maybe


one
 unspoken
 reason,
 maybe
 even


subconscious
 reason,
 is
 that
 it's


becoming
 such
 a
 drag.
 You
 have
 zero


time.
 Parents
 today
 are
 spending
 way


more
 time
 with
 their
 kids
 than
 our


parents
 spent
 with
 us
 because
 they
 think


they
 have
 to
 be
 there
 to
 knit
 every


signups
 and
 to
 watch
 every
 playd
 date


and
 to
 eat
 every
 piece
 of
 pizza
 at
 every


party.


>> But
 one
 thing
 you
 touched
 on
 just
 now
 as


well
 is
 this
 this
 idea
 of
 getting
 other


people
 involved.
 You
 talk
 about
 with
 Let


Grow
 how
 you
 have
 this
 assignment
 for


schools
 where
 they
 can
 have
 encourage


children
 to
 to
 um
 be
 more
 independent.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 we
 have
 a
 question
 actually
 from


from
 Lorie
 C.
 You
 know
 if
 she
 just
 as
 a


single
 as
 a
 parent
 and
 not
 somebody
 who


can
 influence
 what's
 happening
 in
 her


act
 classroom
 in
 her
 child's
 classroom.


She
 says
 what
 advice
 do
 you
 have
 for


parents
 who
 want
 to
 give
 their
 kids
 more


freedom
 but
 maybe
 feel
 judged
 by
 other


parents
 or
 or
 family
 members?
 How
 can


they
 help
 bring
 other
 people
 along
 on


this
 journey?
 the
 family
 members
 a


little
 harder.
 But
 um
 but
 uh
 I
 would
 say


find
 a
 friend.
 Um
 I've
 heard
 of
 parents


who
 like,
 you
 know,
 two
 women
 go
 and
 sit


at
 Starbucks
 and
 they
 send
 their
 kids
 to


the
 other
 end
 of
 the
 strip
 mall
 and


here's
 $10.
 Go
 buy
 something
 at
 the
 the


dollar
 store
 or
 go
 pick
 up
 the
 dry


cleaning.
 We'll
 be
 here.
 It's
 really


much
 easier
 for
 your
 kid
 and
 for
 you.


You're
 distracted
 because
 you're
 talking


to
 your
 friend
 and
 your
 kid
 has
 somebody


to
 do
 something
 with.
 I
 mean,


everything's
 more
 fun
 with
 a
 friend.
 So,


I'd
 say
 find
 a
 couple
 of
 people
 who
 want


to
 practice
 this
 with
 you.
 Um,
 all
 the


stuff
 at
 LetGrow
 is
 free.
 So,
 I'm
 gonna


It's
 let
 Grow.
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 say


that
 we
 have
 the
 four
 weeks
 to
 a
 Let


Grow
 Kid.


And
 it's
 like
 the
 first
 week
 is
 like


have
 kids
 start
 doing
 stuff
 for


themselves
 that
 you've
 been
 doing
 for


them.
 You
 know,
 whether
 that's
 tying


their
 shoes
 or
 getting
 them
 out
 the
 door


or
 let
 them
 bake
 cookies
 and
 they
 take


them
 out
 of
 the
 oven
 themselves.
 Imagine


that.
 And
 then
 the
 next
 week
 is
 getting


around
 the
 neighborhood.
 And
 then


there's
 like
 do
 something
 with
 a
 friend.


And
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 what
 the
 fourth
 week


is,
 but
 you'll
 find
 it
 out.
 And
 and
 the


another
 thing
 that
 somebody
 once


recommended
 to
 me,
 there's
 two
 cool


things.
 Um,
 one
 is
 free
 play
 Fridays,


and
 I
 actually
 just
 heard
 of
 a
 kid
 who


organized
 a
 free
 play
 Friday
 in
 his


neighborhood.
 He
 went
 around,
 he
 put


postcards
 in
 everybody's
 um
 mailbox,
 and


it
 said
 Friday
 afternoon,
 like
 at
 3:00,


3
 to
 6,
 or
 3:00
 to
 5:00.
 how
 about
 all


the
 kids,
 no
 grown-ups,
 don't
 come.


Grown-ups,
 meet
 at
 Locust
 Park
 or


whatever
 and
 we'll
 just
 see
 what


happens.
 We'll
 just
 play.
 And
 he
 didn't


know
 if
 anybody
 was
 gonna
 come.
 And
 I


wish
 I
 could
 remember
 where
 he
 was.
 Um


anyways,
 uh
 to
 his
 delight
 and
 surprise,


20
 kids
 showed
 up
 and
 the
 mom
 sent


photos
 and
 it
 just
 looked
 like,
 you


know,
 it
 looked
 like
 the
 Peanuts
 gang.


uh
 you
 know,
 minus
 Lucy
 being
 a
 jerk,


but
 but
 it
 was
 just
 kids
 in
 the
 park.


Some
 of
 them
 were
 playing
 with
 a
 ball


and
 some
 of
 them
 were
 doing
 whatever.


And
 it's
 just
 so
 great.
 I
 mean,
 it
 fills


your
 heart
 as
 much
 as
 it's
 fulfilling


for
 kids.
 So,
 that's
 one
 idea.
 Free
 play


Fridays.
 Just,
 you
 know,
 use
 a
 list


serve,
 use
 Next
 Door,
 use
 Facebook
 and


say,
 "How
 about
 we
 all
 send
 our
 our
 kids


to
 the
 park
 on
 Fridays?"
 And
 Fridays


because
 it
 leads
 into
 the
 weekend
 and


maybe
 they'll
 do
 it
 again
 on
 their
 own


um
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 weekend.
 And
 the


other
 thing
 is
 this
 one
 mom
 in


California
 started
 what
 she
 called
 a


friendship
 club
 and
 that
 was
 she
 found


her
 son
 had
 like
 three
 or
 four
 friends


in
 the
 neighborhood
 and
 she
 contacted


them
 and
 she
 said
 how
 about
 we
 form
 a


friendship
 club
 which
 in
 my
 day
 would


have
 just
 been
 called
 normal
 life
 where


if
 my
 kid
 I
 mean
 really
 all
 of
 this


stuff
 is
 just
 like
 aren't
 we
 all
 just


trying
 to
 recreate
 our
 childhoods
 but


anyway
 um
 if
 my
 kid
 knocks
 on
 your
 door


and
 your
 kid
 is
 free
 you
 know
 is
 is
 you


know
 Cynthia
 home
 or
 is
 you
 know
 Oliver


home?
 Yes.
 Okay.
 Then
 they
 come
 in,
 they


don't
 have
 to
 organize
 a
 playd
 date


beforehand.
 You're
 not
 going
 to
 see
 this


as
 an
 imposition.
 I'm
 not
 using
 you
 as
 a


babysitter.
 Or
 maybe
 I
 am,
 but
 you
 can


do
 the
 same
 with
 me.
 And
 so
 then
 the
 kid


has
 like
 three
 or
 four
 doors
 that
 he
 can


knock
 on
 anytime
 uh
 you
 know,
 any
 time


of
 day,
 I
 would
 say.
 And
 they
 can
 go


play
 outside,
 they
 can
 play
 in
 the
 lawn,


the
 front
 lawn,
 the
 back
 lawn,
 they
 can


go
 to
 the
 park.
 And
 that
 just
 sort
 of


renits
 the
 neighborhood,
 too.
 And
 I
 also


think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 Peter
 Gray


always
 says
 is
 that
 kids
 are
 not


attracted
 just
 because
 there's
 a


sidewalk
 and
 a
 tree
 outside.
 They're


attracted
 by
 other
 kids.
 And
 once
 you


have
 some
 kids
 playing
 in
 the


neighborhood,
 and
 I've
 seen
 this,
 then


other
 kids
 start
 joining
 them.
 Once
 you


have
 a
 couple
 kids
 walking
 to
 school,


other
 kids
 start
 joining
 them.
 So
 you


just
 want
 to
 sort
 of
 recede


the
 neighborhood
 with
 kids.
 And
 um
 you


do
 that
 with
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 planning


with
 the
 other
 parents.


>> I
 love
 all
 of
 these
 ideas.
 And
 we
 have


so
 many
 other
 questions
 about
 different


people
 within
 the
 community
 and
 how
 they


can
 be
 involved
 in
 this.
 So
 there's
 a


few
 members
 who
 are
 curious
 about
 how


grandparents
 can
 support.
 So
 um
 Richard


R,
 for
 instance,
 uh
 do
 you
 have
 any


suggestions
 on
 how
 to
 constructively


help
 our
 children
 let
 their
 own
 children


grow
 without
 risking
 undermining
 their


trust
 in
 us
 as
 caregivers?


I
 feel
 for
 grandparents
 because
 a
 lot
 of


us
 can
 remember
 uh
 this
 freerange


childhood
 and
 then
 we
 see
 the
 kids


scheduled
 within
 an
 inch
 of
 their
 lives.


I'd
 say
 maybe
 you
 just,
 you
 know,
 happen


to
 leave
 the,
 you
 know,
 Peter
 Gray
 had
 a


great
 TED
 X
 talk
 about
 how
 free
 play
 is


just
 so
 formative
 for
 kids.
 And
 so
 maybe


if
 you
 help
 the
 parents
 see
 without


lecturing
 them,
 let
 like
 this
 free
 time


is
 not
 stupid
 wasted
 time,
 interstitial


time
 between
 the
 important
 time
 of,
 you


know,
 chess,
 soccer,
 and
 school.
 But


it's
 when
 they're
 learning
 how
 to
 make
 a


friend,
 how
 to
 compromise,
 how
 to


explain
 an
 idea,
 how
 to
 be
 creative.
 If


you
 know,
 parents
 are
 very
 concerned


about
 every
 aspect
 of
 their
 kids'
 lives.


And
 if
 they
 see
 that
 free
 play,


unsupervised
 free
 play
 is
 actually


educational
 and
 will
 get
 their
 kids


ahead,
 um,
 then
 it
 becomes
 something


that's
 sort
 of
 speaking
 their
 language.


An
 another
 thing
 that's
 really
 helpful


um
 is
 when
 we
 did
 this
 Harris
 poll
 uh
 we


were
 asking
 kids
 about
 their
 phone
 use


as
 well
 as
 their
 independence
 and
 it


turned
 out
 that
 um
 you
 know
 parents
 are


very
 very
 concerned
 about
 phones
 and


screens.
 So
 this
 is
 a
 way
 to
 speak
 their


language
 about
 that
 which
 is
 that
 when


the
 kids
 were
 asked
 these
 are
 kids
 8
 to


12
 um
 given
 the
 choice
 of
 how
 to
 hang


out
 or
 play
 with
 your
 friends.
 Would
 you


rather
 um
 just
 play
 with
 them


old-fashioned
 way,
 you
 know,
 outside,
 no


agenda,
 no
 adults
 watching,
 just
 figure


out
 what
 to
 do,
 have
 fun
 that
 way,
 or


would
 you
 rather
 be
 in
 an
 organized


activity,
 you
 know,
 like
 soccer
 or


travel
 baseball
 or,
 you
 know,
 piano,


recital,
 ballet,
 or
 would
 you
 rather
 um


be
 online
 with
 them
 playing
 games,
 you


know,
 or
 um
 just
 socializing
 or


scrolling,
 you
 know,
 together?
 what


would
 you
 what
 would
 you
 prefer
 to
 do?


And
 the
 vast
 majority,
 the
 overwhelming


majority
 was


free
 play.


>> They
 just
 want
 to
 be
 with
 their
 friends.


And
 and
 then
 second
 choice
 was
 the


organized
 activity
 and
 third
 choice,
 the


distant
 third
 was
 being
 online.
 So
 I


know
 we
 all
 complain
 like
 kids
 are
 glued


to
 their
 screens.
 That's
 all
 they
 want


to
 do.
 You
 know,
 once
 they
 get
 it,
 it's


like
 heroin.
 but
 but
 they
 wouldn't
 be
 on


them
 as
 much
 if
 they
 had
 an
 alternative.


So
 if
 the
 if
 your
 if
 the
 grandparent
 is


talking
 to
 you
 know
 their
 child
 who's
 a


parent
 um
 who's
 worried
 and
 they
 don't


want
 them
 to
 be
 on
 the
 iPad
 all
 the
 time


and
 they
 want
 to
 restrict
 their
 screen


use
 which
 a
 lot
 of
 parents
 do


understandably


um
 the
 the
 phrase
 that
 we
 use
 know


Jonathan
 height
 is
 one
 of the
 other


co-founders
 with
 me
 of
 let
 grow
 and
 he


also
 wrote
 the
 anxious
 generation
 and
 um


one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 say
 is
 if
 you
 want


to
 take
 away
 the
 screen
 you
 have
 to
 open


the
 door


>> so
 so
 opening
 the
 door
 becomes
 not
 just


something
 that
 I
 think
 is
 good,
 but
 it's


an
 alternative
 to
 the
 phone
 based


childhood
 that
 is
 worrisome.


>> Omar
 B
 asks
 about
 how
 you
 can
 tell
 the


difference
 between
 sort
 of
 healthy


independence
 and
 and
 maybe
 pushing
 a


child
 into
 a
 stressful
 situation
 before


they're
 ready.
 Are
 there
 I
 guess
 are


there
 some
 signs
 that
 we
 should
 look
 for


in
 the
 child
 to
 know
 that
 this
 is
 the


right
 thing
 you're
 doing?


>> I
 think
 everything
 is
 stressful
 at
 the


beginning.
 Um
 it
 was
 stressful
 trying
 to


set
 up
 this
 camera
 today.
 It's
 like,


"Oh,
 this
 is
 leaning
 this
 way
 and
 you


look
 terrible
 and
 get
 closer."
 And
 I


mean,
 there's
 no
 such
 thing
 as
 a


stress-free
 existence.
 And
 um
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 has
 happened
 to


parents
 is
 they've
 been
 told
 that
 their


kids
 shouldn't
 ever
 be
 frightened.
 You


know,
 I
 mean,
 there's
 there's
 there's


people
 who
 are
 against
 Halloween
 because


they're
 scary
 costumes.
 um
 you
 know
 fear


and
 stress
 and
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 um
 you


know
 stage
 fright
 they're
 all
 part
 of


everyday
 life
 in
 childhood
 and
 in


adulthood
 and
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 you


shouldn't
 face
 them
 and
 try
 them
 and
 if


things
 turns
 out
 so
 I
 have
 to
 tell
 you


so
 independence
 is
 being
 used
 did
 I
 tell


you
 this
 already
 in
 there's
 independence


therapy
 is
 a
 new
 thing
 um
 which
 is


giving
 kids
 uh
 as
 you
 might
 think
 some


independence
 to
 do
 new
 things
 um
 if
 they


have
 a
 diagnosis
 of
 anxiety.
 A
 professor


named
 Camilo
 Ortiz
 at
 Long
 Island


University
 did
 a
 pilot
 study
 where
 he


had
 four
 families
 and
 he
 talked
 to
 each


of
 the
 sets
 of
 parents
 first
 and
 found


out
 what
 was
 bothering
 them
 most
 about


their
 kids'
 behavior.
 And
 one
 of
 them


was
 they
 had
 a
 nine-year-old
 who


wouldn't
 go
 upstairs
 or
 downstairs
 in


his
 own
 house
 without
 a
 parent.
 And
 I
 I


thought
 that
 was
 the
 only
 family
 I'd


ever
 heard
 of
 like
 that.
 And
 I've
 I've


heard
 of
 other
 families
 since
 then.


Anyways,
 when
 the
 next
 week
 comes
 for


therapy,
 the
 kid
 comes
 with
 the
 parents


and
 um
 Camilo
 normally
 would
 do


cognitive
 behavioral
 therapy.
 I
 hear


you're
 afraid
 to
 go
 upstairs.
 How
 about


tonight
 you
 go up
 for
 five
 minutes?
 You


know,
 I'll
 give
 you
 a
 watch.
 You'll
 time


it
 and
 then
 you'll
 see
 if
 it
 was
 bad
 or


good,
 and
 then
 we'll
 try
 it
 maybe
 seven


minutes
 the
 next
 week.
 He
 doesn't


mention
 anything
 about
 the
 kid's
 deficit


or
 the
 parents
 worry.
 Instead,
 he
 says,


"You're
 nine.
 I'll
 bet
 there's
 some


things
 you're
 ready
 to
 do
 that
 you


haven't
 tried
 yet.
 And
 then
 the
 kid


says,
 "Are
 you
 kidding?
 I
 want
 to
 take


the
 Long
 Island
 Railroad.
 I
 want
 to
 walk


home
 by
 myself."
 And
 this
 particular
 kid


who
 wanted
 to
 walk
 home
 by
 himself,
 his


mom
 was
 so
 worried,
 she
 took
 the
 day
 off


work
 on
 the
 day
 that
 the
 first
 day
 he


was
 walking
 home.
 Anyways,
 and
 then
 it


got
 more
 and
 more
 normal.
 But
 but
 one
 of


the
 kids
 wanted
 to
 take
 a
 city
 bus
 and


and
 she
 was
 afraid
 to
 sleep
 in
 her
 own


bed,
 but
 she
 was
 willing
 to
 take
 the


city
 bus.
 That
 was
 something
 exciting


for
 her.
 And
 when
 she
 was
 on
 the
 bus,


her
 phone
 stopped
 working
 and
 she
 was


like,
 "Oh
 no,
 you
 know,
 where
 do
 I
 get


off?
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 I'm
 supposed


to
 do."
 And
 she
 was
 like
 very
 frantic.


And
 the
 lady
 sitting
 next
 to
 her
 saw


like,
 "Is
 there
 something
 in
 the
 matter?


Can
 I
 help?"
 And
 she
 said,
 "Yes,
 I
 don't


know
 where
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 get
 off."
 And


the
 lady
 said,
 "Well,
 my
 phone
 works."


"Oh,
 you're
 you
 know,
 you
 missed
 your


stop.
 You
 have
 to
 get
 off
 the
 next
 one.


You
 got
 to
 walk
 back
 a
 few
 blocks."
 And


the
 girl
 said,
 "Thank
 you."
 And
 she
 did.


And
 that
 night
 she
 slept
 in
 her
 own
 bed,


which
 sounds
 like
 it's
 too
 pat
 and


perfect
 to
 be
 real,
 but
 it
 really


happened.
 And
 my
 whole
 point
 is
 that


psychologists
 believe
 a
 that


independence
 is
 important,
 but
 b
 messing


up
 is
 great.
 When
 something
 goes
 wrong,


uh
 that's
 when
 you
 realize
 like,
 oh,
 I


can
 handle
 this
 or
 that
 wasn't
 the
 end


of
 the
 world.
 And
 that
 is
 very
 freeing.


I
 think
 that's
 the
 I
 think
 that's
 the


whole
 Nike
 idea,
 too.
 Why
 do
 it?
 You


might
 mess
 up.
 It's
 like
 that's
 okay.


That's
 part
 of
 the
 process.
 And
 once
 you


realize
 that
 that
 it's
 not
 doom,
 it's


just
 a
 hiccup,


>> then
 you
 are
 way
 more
 free.


>> You
 you
 learn
 by
 by
 doing
 um
 by


experiencing
 things.


>> Yeah.


>> I'd
 love
 to
 broaden
 this
 out
 a
 little


more.
 So,
 we
 we
 definitely
 understand


the
 the
 benefits
 that
 you
 think
 exist


for
 children
 and
 for
 parents
 to
 do
 this


and
 and
 and
 you
 know,
 others
 in
 schools


and
 that
 sort
 of
 thing,
 but
 what
 is


what's
 in
 it
 for
 for
 everyone
 else?
 what


what
 is
 the
 benefit
 for
 the
 wider


community
 for
 people
 without
 children
 by


giving
 by
 allowing
 children
 to
 have
 more


freedom?


>> Um
 I'm
 going
 to
 give
 you
 two
 different


examples.
 Uh
 one
 is
 the
 workplace.
 You


know,
 eventually
 these
 children
 go
 off


to
 work
 and
 I
 can't
 be
 the
 only
 one


who's
 hearing
 the
 stories
 about
 young


people
 at
 work
 being
 very
 um
 I'd
 say


conscientious
 but
 waiting
 for


instructions.
 They've
 had
 so
 much


instruction
 all
 the
 time
 that
 I've
 heard


in
 schools
 the
 kids
 wait
 to
 like
 to
 fill


out
 their
 name
 on
 a
 piece
 of
 paper.
 It's


like
 do
 I
 put
 my
 name
 on
 the
 left
 or
 the


right?
 I've
 heard
 of
 schools
 where
 they


say
 that
 a
 kid's
 uh
 I
 hate
 L
 like
 pencil


drops
 to
 the
 ground


and
 they
 wait
 to
 be
 either
 for
 the


teacher
 to
 come
 and
 pick
 it
 up
 or
 for


them
 to
 be
 allowed
 to
 pick
 it
 up.


They're
 so
 used
 to
 being
 programmed
 that


they've
 sort
 of
 lost
 this
 um
 getgo.
 You


know
 what
 is
 it?
 go
 get
 them
 spirit.
 And


and
 that's
 what
 we're
 hearing
 about
 at


work,
 too.
 You
 know,
 you
 have
 you
 have


good
 workers,
 but
 you
 don't
 have
 the


entrepreneurs.
 you
 don't
 have
 this


amazing
 American
 spirit
 of
 like
 let
 me


try
 this
 or
 this
 sounds
 crazy
 but
 so
 in


the
 workplace
 you
 want
 kids
 who
 have


grown
 up
 you
 know
 tinkering
 and
 trying


things
 that
 when
 NASA
 had
 its
 generation


of
 you
 know
 boomers
 retire
 and
 they
 had


these
 new
 kids
 coming
 in
 uh
 they
 were


great
 on
 computers
 and
 great
 at
 you
 know


problem
 sets
 but
 if
 there
 was
 ever
 an


Apollo
 13
 they
 didn't
 know
 what
 to
 do


when
 things
 went
 off
 script
 so
 you
 want


people
 who
 are
 growing
 up
 a
 little
 more


scrappy
 happy,
 a
 little
 more


self-sufficient.
 And
 what
 else
 was
 I


going
 to
 tell
 you?
 Um,
 I
 mean,
 I
 I
 guess


it's
 just
 that
 God,
 what
 was
 I
 going
 to


tell
 you?
 Who
 who
 is
 benefiting
 from


this
 besides
 Well,
 one
 thing
 that's


obvious
 is
 that
 when
 you
 do
 have
 kids


back
 out
 in
 the
 neighborhood,
 I
 don't


care
 if
 you
 have
 kids
 or
 not.
 I
 mean,
 my


kids
 are
 old,
 but
 it's
 pretty
 sweet.
 You


know,
 you
 you
 see
 them
 out
 there,
 you


hear
 some
 laughter,
 you
 hear
 some
 spats.


um
 you
 it's
 just
 a
 a
 neighborhood
 that


comes
 back
 to
 life
 and
 that's
 a
 lot
 more


friendly
 and
 heartwarming
 than
 a


neighborhood
 just
 completely
 tumble


weeds
 up
 and
 down
 the
 block
 because
 the


kids
 are
 driven
 and
 then
 they're
 pulled


into
 the
 garage
 and
 then
 they
 insert


themselves
 into
 the
 you
 know
 into
 the


house
 and
 it's
 time
 for
 the
 reading
 log.


So
 if
 if
 only
 for
 um
 you
 know
 just
 the


joy
 of
 having
 a
 very
 vibrant
 culture
 as


opposed
 to
 a
 very
 locked
 down
 culture


and
 and
 for
 the
 parents
 who
 are
 just
 so


bored
 driving
 their
 kids
 everywhere.


>> You
 actually
 have
 influenced
 um
 policy


around
 giving
 kids
 freedom
 through


through
 let
 grow.
 In
 your
 talk
 you


mentioned
 a
 new
 law
 the
 reasonable


childhood
 independence
 law
 that
 makes
 it


legal
 for
 parents
 to
 let
 their
 kids
 go


places
 alone.
 Um
 what
 more
 do
 you
 think


we
 need
 from
 from
 government
 and
 from


our
 communities
 to
 make
 this
 cultural


shift
 happen?


>> Oh
 my
 that's
 like
 so
 the
 laws
 are
 great


and
 when
 I
 gave
 the
 talk
 I
 think
 we
 had


had
 eight
 states
 had
 passed
 the


reasonable
 childhood
 independence
 law


which
 says
 that
 neglect
 is
 when
 you
 put


your
 kid
 in
 obvious
 and
 serious
 danger.


Not
 anytime
 you
 take
 your
 eyes
 off
 them.


And
 it's
 great
 for
 the
 freerange
 parents


who
 want
 their
 kids
 to
 you
 know
 be


wandering
 around
 and
 on
 their
 bikes
 like


str
 like
 Stranger
 Things.
 Um,
 but
 it's


also
 great
 for
 parents
 living
 in


poverty.
 You
 know,
 if
 a
 mom
 is
 working


two
 jobs
 and
 her
 kid
 comes
 home
 with
 the


oldfashioned
 latch
 key,
 uh,
 that's
 not


because
 she's
 a
 neglectful
 mom.
 It's


because
 she's
 a
 mom
 who
 realizes
 like,


look,
 my
 eight-year-old
 can
 get
 herself


a
 glass
 of
 milk
 and
 or
 almond
 milk
 now,


I
 guess.
 And,
 uh,
 and
 that's
 and
 I
 can


save
 on
 a
 babysitter.
 So,
 that
 shouldn't


be
 considered
 neglect
 either.
 So
 since


the
 talk
 um
 the
 law
 has
 been
 passed
 in


three
 more
 states,
 Georgia,
 Florida,
 and


Missouri,
 and
 now
 it's
 being
 considered


in
 eight
 more
 states.
 And
 maybe
 someday


there
 will
 be
 federal
 legislation
 that


says
 the
 same
 thing,
 which
 is
 that,
 you


know,
 we
 don't
 want
 the
 laws
 right
 now


say
 if
 you
 see
 something,
 say
 something.


And
 too
 many
 people
 don't
 know
 like
 what


am
 I
 supposed
 to
 say
 and
 see?
 And
 it's


like
 they
 see
 a
 kid
 outside,
 sometimes


they'll
 call
 911
 because
 they're
 just
 so


unusing
 kids
 outside
 again.
 So,
 if
 if


the
 911
 operator
 can
 say,
 "Is
 the
 kid


okay?"
 Yeah,
 they're
 fine.
 They're,
 you


know,
 they're
 they're
 playing
 in
 the


park
 or
 whatever,
 that
 should
 be
 the
 end


of
 things.
 It
 should
 not
 go
 from
 there


to
 any
 kind
 of
 investigation.
 So,
 that's


a
 great
 law
 and
 um
 hopefully
 it
 will
 be


passed
 in
 all
 50
 states
 uh
 pretty
 darn


soon.
 But
 but
 more
 generally,
 I
 think
 we


have
 to
 do
 this
 grace
 thing
 where
 we
 see


kids
 outside
 and
 we
 don't
 think
 like


where's
 the
 mom
 and
 we
 don't
 think


somebody
 once
 wrote
 and
 said,
 "Well,
 so


if
 your
 child
 is
 on
 a
 skateboard
 and


they
 fall
 down
 in
 front
 of
 my
 house,
 I


have
 to
 help
 them."
 And
 it's
 like,


"Yeah,
 you
 do.
 If
 you
 see
 them,
 if
 you


have
 a
 band-aid,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 have a


phone,
 you
 you
 do
 have
 to
 help
 them."


And
 I
 don't
 think
 of
 that
 as


babysitting.
 I
 don't
 think
 of
 that
 as


like
 some
 horrible
 mom
 who
 thrust
 her


entire
 responsibility
 on
 you.
 I
 think
 of


that
 as
 being
 part
 of
 a
 community.


You're
 at
 the
 park,
 you
 know,
 uh,
 a
 kid


needs
 a
 band-aid,
 you
 give
 them
 a


band-aid,
 not
 because
 it's
 an


imposition,
 but
 because
 it's
 nice.
 You


know,
 you're
 nice
 and
 it's
 nice
 to
 be


nice
 to
 a
 kid.
 You
 hope
 that
 somebody's


nice
 to
 your
 kid
 or
 to
 you
 when
 you're


older
 and
 you
 fall
 down.
 And
 so
 I
 think


just
 giving
 everybody
 the
 benefit
 of
 the


doubt
 as
 opposed
 to
 thinking
 the
 worst


about
 them
 that
 you
 know
 any
 guy
 at
 the


park
 is
 a
 predator,
 any
 kid
 at
 the
 park


alone
 is,
 you
 know,
 um
 somebody
 who's


neglected
 by
 a
 terrible
 parent.
 Like


just
 giving
 people
 the
 benefit
 of
 the


doubt
 is
 just
 a
 great
 way
 to
 live.
 It


makes
 your
 life
 more
 fun.
 It
 makes
 you


see
 the
 world
 in
 a
 better
 way.
 And
 and


it
 actually,
 you
 know,
 weirdly
 enough,


there
 was
 a
 study
 done
 of
 people
 who


tell
 their
 kids,
 you
 know,
 the
 world
 is


doggy
 dog
 place
 and
 don't
 be
 a
 psy
 and


everybody's
 going
 to
 try
 to
 take


advantage
 of
 you
 versus,
 you
 know,
 most


people
 are
 decent
 and
 you
 can
 trust
 and


default
 to
 trust.
 And
 somehow
 they


studied
 these
 two
 different
 groups
 of


kids
 for
 years
 like
 into
 their
 middle


age
 and
 they
 found
 that
 the
 ones
 the


parents
 who
 raised
 the
 kids
 saying
 like


everybody's
 bad,
 beware,
 you
 know,
 don't


let
 your
 guard
 down
 were
 doing
 it
 out
 of


love.
 They
 thought
 that
 they
 were


protecting
 their
 kids,
 but
 in
 fact,


those
 kids
 in
 middle
 age
 had
 worse


relationships,
 worse
 health,
 and
 less


professional
 success.
 So,
 I'm
 not


exactly
 sure
 why,
 but
 you
 might
 as
 well


default
 to
 trust.


>> Well,
 it's
 I
 mean,
 it's
 I
 I
 think
 so


interesting
 to
 think
 about
 the
 the
 role


that
 communities
 are
 playing
 in
 all
 of


this.
 And
 and
 we
 have
 a
 a
 question
 from


um
 from
 Amy
 S.
 who
 talks
 about
 a
 a
 four


and
 a
 six-year-old
 child
 children
 she


has
 and
 and
 how
 she
 lets
 her
 children


roam
 outside
 of
 of
 of
 her
 home
 and
 often


you
 know
 gets
 reactions
 from
 from


neighbors
 and
 is
 soon
 would
 like
 to
 see


them
 go
 to
 the
 park
 two
 blocks
 away
 by


themselves
 and
 her
 question
 is
 um
 what


whether
 you
 have
 thoughts
 on
 how
 a


strategy
 a
 good
 strategy
 for
 um
 a
 safe


solo
 crosswalk
 um
 especially
 for
 kids
 on


scooters
 but
 I
 guess
 this
 is
 a
 question


both
 for
 how
 parents
 can
 help
 their
 kids


cross
 safely,
 but
 also
 what
 can


communities
 um
 implement
 to
 to
 make
 this


a
 better
 experience
 for
 everyone?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 I
 mean,
 cars


have
 existed
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 And
 boy,


in
 kindergarten,
 we
 were
 taught,
 you


know,
 the
 the
 the
 school
 felt
 it


incumbent
 upon
 itself
 to
 teach
 look


left,
 look
 right,
 look
 left
 again.
 I


have
 no
 idea
 why
 we
 had
 to
 look
 left
 and


right
 and
 left
 again.
 Why
 don't
 just


look
 left
 and
 right
 and
 go?
 But
 I
 would


teach
 them
 that
 because
 Mrs.
 Tixinsky


taught
 me
 that
 and
 so
 far
 I'm
 alive.
 Um,


crosswalks
 are
 good
 if
 you
 can
 convince


a
 neighborhood
 to
 put
 one
 in.
 I
 guess


you
 talk
 to
 your,
 you
 know,
 your
 your


city
 council
 or
 whatever
 you
 have
 there.


But
 you
 can't
 let
 perfect
 be
 the
 enemy


of
 the
 good,
 I
 guess,
 which
 is
 that
 if


you
 have
 two
 kids
 together
 and
 they're


holding
 hands
 and
 they're
 both
 looking


left,
 right,
 left,
 and
 there's
 no
 cars


coming,
 they're
 listening
 for
 it
 and


they're
 looking
 for
 it.
 They're
 humans.


They
 They
 can
 cross
 the
 street.
 Um,
 one


thing
 that
 LetGrow
 has
 done
 is
 that
 if


you
 go
 to
 our
 site,
 letGGrow.org.


I
 wish
 I
 had
 it
 with
 me,
 but
 we
 have
 a


little
 um
 a
 little
 card.
 This
 isn't
 it.


And
 it
 says
 it
 kids
 can
 carry
 it
 with


them.
 And
 it's
 the
 LetGrow
 license.
 It


says,
 "I
 am
 not
 lost
 or
 neglected.


My
 parents
 know
 I'm
 out
 here.
 If
 you


don't
 believe
 me,
 you
 know,
 you
 can
 call


my
 mom."
 And
 here's
 some
 other
 our our


old
 more
 um
 aggressive
 card
 used
 to
 say,


"Call
 my
 lawyer.
 which
 a
 little
 much.


Um,
 but
 anyways,
 it
 just
 says
 and
 it


says,
 "I
 know
 I
 can
 talk
 to
 I
 can
 talk


to
 people.
 I
 can't
 go
 off
 with
 anyone.


I'm
 talking
 to
 you
 and
 I'm
 grateful
 that


you
 care,
 that
 I'm
 safe
 and
 that's
 why


you're
 talking
 to
 me."
 So,
 it
 sort
 of


flips
 the
 person
 from
 like,
 "Where's


your
 mom?"
 to,
 "Thank
 you
 for
 caring.


This
 is
 the
 whole
 point.
 You're
 an
 adult


in
 the
 neighborhood.
 You're
 worried
 for


me."
 That's
 what
 I
 assume
 of
 most
 adults


in
 the
 neighborhood
 that
 they're
 looking


out
 for
 me
 as
 opposed
 to,
 you
 know,
 they


want
 to
 throw
 my
 mom
 in
 jail.
 So,
 and


the
 other
 thing
 is
 going
 back
 to
 trying


to
 create
 some
 some
 kind
 of
 collective


thing
 either
 v via
 the
 school
 or
 you
 put


the
 notes
 in
 everybody's
 um
 mailbox.


Let's
 have
 free
 play
 Fridays
 and
 then


all
 the
 kids
 get
 used
 to
 coming
 to
 the


park
 and
 looking
 both
 ways
 and
 the


parents
 get
 used
 to
 it
 too.
 It
 is
 cars


are
 my
 least
 favorite
 thing.
 I'm


terrified
 of
 cars,
 but
 I
 live
 in
 a
 world


where
 there
 are
 cars.
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 when
 you've
 taught
 your
 kid


and
 you've
 watched
 them
 a
 couple
 times,


you
 know,
 very,
 you
 know,
 like
 step
 back


because
 there's
 a
 car
 a
 block
 away
 and


they
 want
 to
 wait
 for
 it
 to
 get
 all
 the


way
 across
 the
 street
 and
 you
 see
 that


they're
 conscientious,
 I'd
 say
 by
 age


five,
 um,
 you
 can
 start
 trusting
 them.
 H


>> well
 I
 love
 the
 idea
 of
 the
 cards
 that


it
 feels
 like
 it's
 such
 a
 smart
 easy
 way


to
 to
 help
 uh
 this
 process
 for
 everyone


>> right
 and
 they're
 free
 they're
 free
 just


download
 it it's
 free


>> well
 you
 know
 there's
 so
 many
 challenges


that
 we're
 facing
 in
 this
 time
 you
 know


connected
 to
 technology
 the
 world
 is


just
 changing
 so
 so
 rapidly
 um
 what


gives
 you
 hope
 that
 we
 can
 raise
 a


generation
 of
 more


>> confident
 independent
 kids
 despite
 all


the
 things
 going
 on
 in
 the


Well,
 I
 think
 the
 fact
 that
 people
 are


recognizing
 I
 mean
 really
 the
 the
 fact


that
 we're
 talking
 here
 I
 mean
 I've
 been


trying
 to
 get
 a
 TED
 talk
 for
 17
 years


here
 it
 is
 year
 17
 and
 legitimacy
 shines


on
 this
 message
 that
 gives
 me
 a
 lot
 of


hope.
 I
 mean,
 the
 fact
 that
 uh
 you
 know,


Ted
 invited
 me
 to
 speak
 and
 then
 here
 I


am
 again
 today
 is
 that
 for
 a
 couple


years
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 when
 I
 was


starting
 my
 blog,
 the
 the
 freerange
 kids


blog,
 I
 was
 voted
 by
 some
 organization


the
 most
 controversial
 blogger
 in


America
 or
 maybe
 mommy
 blogger
 and
 you


know
 I
 got
 this
 nickname
 America's
 worst


mom
 and
 I
 think
 that
 people
 are
 coming


to
 see
 that
 like
 there's
 something
 to


you
 know
 trusting
 your
 kids
 to
 do
 more


on
 their
 own
 that
 is
 um
 It's
 not
 crazy.


It's
 actually
 organic.
 It's
 what
 they


were,
 that's
 why
 they
 want
 to
 explore.


That's
 why
 they
 go
 from
 crawling
 to


walking.
 They
 wanna,
 you
 know,
 they
 want


to
 do
 more.
 They
 want
 to
 take
 on
 the


world.
 And
 that
 when
 we
 step
 back,
 let


Grow's
 slogan
 is
 when
 adults
 step
 back,


kids
 step
 up.
 And
 so
 that
 gives
 me
 hope.


And
 and
 Tik
 Tok,
 for
 God's
 sake,
 if
 it's


a
 trend
 on
 Tik
 Tok,
 must
 be
 really


important.


Well,
 Lenor,
 we
 are
 um
 out
 of
 time
 and
 I


feel
 like
 we
 could
 talk
 uh
 for
 so
 much


longer
 about
 this.
 There,


>> you
 know,


>> I
 have
 to
 say
 people
 always
 say
 that
 to


me
 and
 I
 think
 they're
 saying
 like,
 "My


god,
 she
 just
 doesn't
 stop.
 How
 am
 I


gonna
 get
 her
 to
 stop?"
 I'll
 say,
 "Oh,


we
 could
 talk,
 but
 we
 got
 to
 say


goodbye."
 So,
 I


>> truly
 we
 didn't
 we
 didn't
 hit
 on
 all
 my


questions.
 We
 didn't
 hit
 on
 all
 of
 the


member
 questions.
 Thank
 you
 to
 the


members
 for
 the
 for
 submitting
 your


questions.
 I'm
 sorry
 if
 we
 didn't
 get
 to


yours.
 And
 thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Lenor,
 for


for
 taking
 the
 time
 to
 chat
 with
 us.


This
 is
 um
 has
 been
 great.
 And
 uh
 we're


excited
 to
 to
 see
 more
 of
 you
 in
 the
 the


TED
 TED
 space.


>> Oh
 my
 god,
 I'm
 excited
 too.
 And
 thank


you,
 Whitney.
 And
 thank
 you,
 Ted.
