[Speaker 0]:  hello，
[Speaker 0]:  everyone，
[Speaker 0]:  friday，
[Speaker 0]:  january，
[Speaker 0]:  thirty eighth th，
[Speaker 0]:  twenty twenty six。
[Speaker 0]:  welcome to episode ten，
[Speaker 0]:  twelve of tax news，
[Speaker 0]:  please be quiet。
[Speaker 0]:  on january twelve，
[Speaker 0]:  the ministry of finance and the state taxation administration joinly issued an announcement stating that starting from april this year，
[Speaker 0]:  photball take exports will no longer enjoy value at a tax rebates。
[Speaker 0]:  why has the photoball take industry been stripped of this preferential treatment from an industrial prospective？
[Speaker 0]:  it's because chinese photoball take industry is finanstrong enough and no longer needs protection from a financial perspective，
[Speaker 0]:  a considerable portion of photiable tatake investment dridriven local governments forcably initiating projects for political gain，
[Speaker 0]:  leading to excetitake compesttion。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  the export tax rebay treatment has been revolved。
[Speaker 0]:  let me first explain the export tax rebate policy。
[Speaker 0]:  simply put，
[Speaker 0]:  it's a national level policy that encourages companies to export goods before the nineteen eighties，
[Speaker 0]:  all four foreign n exoarned by local governments and state on enterprises with centrally controlled by the central government。
[Speaker 0]:  chmost commodity imports also required approval at the central ministry level and arting in ninenineteen eighty four，
[Speaker 0]:  china reformed its foregn trade lestel along local governments to retain a portion of foreign change for their own use after local governments obtained impquotas。
[Speaker 0]:  although they did import some production equipment，
[Speaker 0]:  a large amount of foign exchange would spent on consumer goods taking haman island。
[Speaker 0]:  at that time is an example in one year。
[Speaker 0]:  it imported nearly eighty thousand cars and three million television sets，
[Speaker 0]:  which were then ressold in the mainland。
[Speaker 0]:  at that time，
[Speaker 0]:  chinese total foreigexexresserves were just over eight billion us dollars ars haynen，
[Speaker 0]:  which was only an administrate of region undergoing on spent five hundred million。
[Speaker 0]:  please read a news report for me among the ninety four units under the jurisdiction of hayman eighty eight oown cars，
[Speaker 0]:  even schools and kindergardens were participating。
[Speaker 0]:  in addition，
[Speaker 0]:  hayman also imported a large number of televisions，
[Speaker 0]:  video，
[Speaker 0]:  recyders and motorcycles。
[Speaker 0]:  in one hundred ninety five。
[Speaker 0]:  the total number of cars imported by the country was equal to the total number of carons imported from nineteen nineteen fifty to nineteen nineteen seventy ty after the handan incident。
[Speaker 0]:  the phenomenon of using policy loophoto reresel and smuggle imported cars continue to exist from nineteen eighty three to nineteen eighty seven。
[Speaker 0]:  ty local governments used foregn exchange to import a large number of cars amounting to sixteen bilillion us dollars acquiquivalent to two criyster corporations。
[Speaker 0]:  a year later，
[Speaker 0]:  chinese total four，
[Speaker 0]:  four exchanexorts ts，
[Speaker 0]:  only two billion US dollars，
[Speaker 0]:  a decreof of more in six billion US dollars compared to the previous year。
[Speaker 0]:  financial reserves were critically low and the country was at risk bankrupcy。
[Speaker 0]:  in order to bring back bankkexporin，
[Speaker 0]:  the order decided to enrige exports at that time among chineineconcentrated high tech products in the military industry，
[Speaker 0]:  only iran and rock were willing to pay other industrial products or light industrial products had high costs，
[Speaker 0]:  so had had to find a weight obtain price，
[Speaker 0]:  competiveness stin foreign exchange，
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  starting in nineteen ninety eighty five，
[Speaker 0]:  the central government introdued an export tax rebate policy to reduce enterprise production costs who would pay for the tax rebates。
[Speaker 0]:  tes，
[Speaker 0]:  this was the most crucial part，
[Speaker 0]:  the policicy。
[Speaker 0]:  the first first three years it was calculated according for the curprise profit relationship done。
[Speaker 0]:  for example，
[Speaker 0]:  if a central enterprise exported，
[Speaker 0]:  the central would would ar the cost。
[Speaker 0]:  if if a local enterprise porporthe local governgovernment would bear the cost。
[Speaker 0]:  but this brought another problem，
[Speaker 0]:  although local governments could retain a portion of foren exchange，
[Speaker 0]:  the majority still had to be handed over to the central government，
[Speaker 0]:  meant that the the export performance，
[Speaker 0]:  the more money，
[Speaker 0]:  the local government would lose。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  starting in nineteen nineteen eighty eight，
[Speaker 0]:  the country implemented some reforms in foreign trade。
[Speaker 0]:  the central government bore most of the tax rebate cost sts。
[Speaker 0]:  local governments also had to submit forein trade plans annually to determine how much foreign exchange they contcontrite。
[Speaker 0]:  local governments could retain a portion of income exceeding the plan from then on local governments organized exports using a contract system。
[Speaker 0]:  local governments acted as contractors for foreigtrade until nineteen ninety four when the as foreign trade lawas enacted，
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  customs have remained under unified central management belonging to the central governments authority for decades。
[Speaker 0]:  afterward，
[Speaker 0]:  the cost of exporore tax rebates has also been basically born by the central government in twenty sixteen or reformal information naation wide to replace business tax with value attacks that the vb receive by local governments is shared with the central government。
[Speaker 0]:  as mentioned，
[Speaker 0]:  the tax information section number one hundred one，
[Speaker 0]:  one of the purposes of centrcentral government adopt the vet was to transfer atrevenue venue，
[Speaker 0]:  lower cities to smaller cities。
[Speaker 0]: 对，
[Speaker 0]: 嗯，
[Speaker 0]: 其他的没的。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  in terms of vaan export tax rebates while maintaining transtafor payments to local governments，
[Speaker 0]:  this effectively means that the central government bears the cost of commodity exports，
[Speaker 0]:  reducing the burden on local governments。
[Speaker 0]:  from a positive perspective，
[Speaker 0]:  the tax rebate policy can reduce enterprise production cost，
[Speaker 0]:  helping domestic enterprises maintain price competitiveness and capture international markets。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  on the other hand，
[Speaker 0]:  local governments did not bear the full cost of tax refunds，
[Speaker 0]:  knowing the potential for arbitrage since the central government was paying，
[Speaker 0]:  regardless of how much profit companies could make，
[Speaker 0]:  exports could at least contribute to GDP for companies，
[Speaker 0]:  even with zero profit or even selling it a loss。
[Speaker 0]:  as long as the tax refunds could cover the difference。
[Speaker 0]:  they could still make some money。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  local governments and companies develop the taset understanding to collectively exploit the the central governmenfunds ds for the past decade or so many local governments in companies have been developing portratrabased on the ideideof，
[Speaker 0]:  relying ying the central government funds。
[Speaker 0]:  the photovall take industry is just one example。
[Speaker 0]:  let's briefly review the development process of chinese photovall take industry。
[Speaker 0]:  many viewers may remember the the interal once dedescribe chinese photovall take industry as three heads outside，
[Speaker 0]:  meaning that the high perioity policsilicon used in photovall take panels had to be imported from the united states in germany。
[Speaker 0]:  the production had to be imported from europe and less than ten percent of the photol tatape ananelproduproduwere consumed domestically，
[Speaker 0]:  with the rest mainly sold to europe to digest a surplus。
[Speaker 0]:  in two thousand nine，
[Speaker 0]:  china launch the golden den sun project developing domestic photil take power generation through government subsidies。
[Speaker 0]:  as for the effectivenss ss，
[Speaker 0]:  this round of of subsidies，
[Speaker 0]:  please allow me to read report from the beijing business daily，
[Speaker 0]:  a company told the beijing business daily reporter that the freshohold for the golden ssun project was very low as long as they could obtain griden rooftop permits they could apply。
[Speaker 0]:  and if successful，
[Speaker 0]:  they could receive a large amount of subsidy funds。
[Speaker 0]:  some companies purchase substandard materials for。
[Speaker 0]:  and since no one supervised the power generation after the project was completed，
[Speaker 0]:  they were not afraid to being investigated。
[Speaker 0]:  as a result，
[Speaker 0]:  the overall subsidies were not fully utilized public that shows that the ministry of finance demanded the recovery of subsidy funds for nearly eighty percent of the installed capacity of the golden sun projects cts the two thousand nine to twenty eleven，
[Speaker 0]:  possibly exceeding seven billion on domestic prowas was discored red and the overseas market enentered problems。
[Speaker 0]:  at this time，
[Speaker 0]:  the selling price of chinese phototable tataproducts was only half of the production cost of their european counterparts，
[Speaker 0]:  most companies，
[Speaker 0]:  including suntapopower and n in way，
[Speaker 0]:  solar suffered huge losses，
[Speaker 0]:  and only only survive seven，
[Speaker 0]:  relying on sport tax rebates，
[Speaker 0]:  starting in twenty twelve。
[Speaker 0]:  the EU ununch in antidumping investigation against chinese photovall take industry and ultimately decided to impose a sixty four point nine percent anty dumping duty and eleven point five percent anty subsidy duty the following wwshi shanda，
[Speaker 0]:  then chinese largest phoval tag uufactur r rectly declared bankrypy y suppsupport domestic phoval take industry，
[Speaker 0]:  the state council launch a new round of subsidy policies。
[Speaker 0]:  this time the subsidiwere more scientifially industry becoming a generate electricity first，
[Speaker 0]:  then get paid system companies can no longer rely on tax rebates or frogling product claims receive subsities bebean an honestly focus on developing technology to reduce power generation costs before mating sitsitation ation having romattricity induicy and market all aliline on foressources gradually transformed into a situation were all three domestically source。
[Speaker 0]:  only at this point did china truly possess its own photball take industry chain dominating the global market。
[Speaker 0]:  china mastered ptoval tatake technology while also lowering the entry barrier for domestic industrial development companies，
[Speaker 0]:  regardless of their previous business，
[Speaker 0]:  EG pig，
[Speaker 0]:  arming or vegetable growing could urchase completely production lines domestically as long as they had sufficient cash low for，
[Speaker 0]:  for example，
[Speaker 0]:  chanjen GG white wone public help plines build over three thousand automated photovall take production lines with low technological barriers in government subsidies available chinese photovall take industry quickly bombagain by twenty twenty two。
[Speaker 0]:  china has six hundred automated photlwtake enterprises and the industry scale peaked in twenty fourteen。
[Speaker 0]:  in that year，
[Speaker 0]:  chinese installed photball take capacity accounted for fifty percent of the global total，
[Speaker 0]:  and its policyilicon industry accounted for nearly eighty percent of the global market。
[Speaker 0]:  chineis newly added installed photvtatake capcapacreach ach two hundred seventy seven gigaatds exceeding the some of the rest of the world industries without technological barriers and vvitably face fierce competition compared to twenty twelve。
[Speaker 0]:  photvall take power generation costs decrease by ninety percent，
[Speaker 0]:  but even with subsidies tatareates tes，
[Speaker 0]:  but ies still struggle to make a profit。
[Speaker 0]:  afptovable take power generation project tender in chndromsaw w winning ning id dropped to sixty eight fent per one，
[Speaker 0]:  barely covercocost，
[Speaker 0]:  and leaving almost no profit。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  simultaneously for the sake of political achievements，
[Speaker 0]:  local governments continue to invest eight hundred billion u。
[Speaker 0]:  one to build more photball take factories ininse domestic market competition in chinese photoball。
[Speaker 0]:  take industry also impacted the international market，
[Speaker 0]:  effectively crushing foreign petiators from twenty twenty three inwds eeuroexperiexperithe，
[Speaker 0]:  sevvover capacacity and pootbtatape production with virtually all phodal tatake companies。
[Speaker 0]:  announcing layoyos are factory cloclosure res gglobal solar energy industry has almost entirely become dominated by chinese companies。
[Speaker 0]:  in twenty twenty four，
[Speaker 0]:  china exported two hundred thirty six dediwatts of solar components。
[Speaker 0]:  a thirteen percent increase compared to twenty three domestic ininstaltations remained 不想圈一圈。
[Speaker 0]:  in march seven，
[Speaker 0]:  chinese provinces had solar export trade volumes exceeding one hundred million u one and eleven provinces exceceded ten million lion on，
[Speaker 0]:  while market market share is increasing。
[Speaker 0]:  companies are earning less and less money，
[Speaker 0]:  although the total export volume of solar products increased by thirty three percent，
[Speaker 0]:  the total transaction value decrease by thirty three percent。
[Speaker 0]:  this indicates a significant price drop in chineinese lar lar products to absorb access capacity。
[Speaker 0]:  the data for various components is even more astonishing。
[Speaker 0]:  for example，
[Speaker 0]:  the export volume of solar cells increased by perperent，
[Speaker 0]:  while the total tal transaction ue ue creased by thirty percent，
[Speaker 0]:  if calculated from twenty perperent，
[Speaker 0]:  the price of china exporporsolar lar ononts ts dropped by over sixty percent。
[Speaker 0]:  many viewers may still remember ridiculous new story，
[Speaker 0]:  because the price of chinese solar panels was cheaper than ordinary building materials。
[Speaker 0]:  many europeans directly used solar panels to repair their homes。
[Speaker 0]:  these are product subsidized by the chinese central government through tax rebates。
[Speaker 0]:  or rather，
[Speaker 0]:  we are all paying taxes to subsidized this internal competition and the prices that no one makes money in the twenty twenty three value of chchinese solar industry was nearly one point four trillion unon。
[Speaker 0]:  but in twenty twenty four，
[Speaker 0]:  it became seven hundred hundred ty ty ilillion on on having a value。
[Speaker 0]:  the revenue with almost all solar listed companies has fallen arbly，
[Speaker 0]:  and the entire industry has a bookloss of twenty four point four billion u on with potential losses that are are measurable according to normal market principles。
[Speaker 0]:  if an industry cannot make money，
[Speaker 0]:  internal liliminwill will gin small，
[Speaker 0]:  small sce and incompetitive companies will continuously go bankrupt。
[Speaker 0]:  and finally，
[Speaker 0]:  a few high level leadcompanies will remain in start making money again in twenty twelve，
[Speaker 0]:  a leading chinese solar company encountered marketchm g and when bankrupt the following year，
[Speaker 0]:  indicating that market principles were still effective at that time。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  this principle is now ineffective。
[Speaker 0]:  as mentioned earlier，
[Speaker 0]:  the number of chinese solar companies，
[Speaker 0]:  which six hundred sevenseventhousand thousand，
[Speaker 0]:  twenty twenty twenty two，
[Speaker 0]:  and finally expected to reach one point two，
[Speaker 0]:  four million in twenty twenty twenty five，
[Speaker 0]:  nearly doubling solar companies are expanding against the trend，
[Speaker 0]:  and their dead is also increasing by the end of twenty twenty three。
[Speaker 0]:  the total dead of one hundred seventeen a share listed solar power companies in china reach nearly one，
[Speaker 0]:  nine，
[Speaker 0]:  nine trilone one with three seven companies。
[Speaker 0]:  having that exceceeten billion you one eleven exceeding fifty billion you one and three exceeding one hundred billion you on by the end of marhundred billion one。
[Speaker 0]:  the todedet had increased to two point three，
[Speaker 0]:  two trillion you one and increase of over three hundred forty billion u。
[Speaker 0]:  one compared to the previous year。
[Speaker 0]:  if unlisted companies are included，
[Speaker 0]:  the number would be even higher solar power companies are able to borrow gh money while losing money thanks to the port of local governments。
[Speaker 0]:  local governments believe that keeping these companies in their area will create GDP，
[Speaker 0]:  and the the mature technology of the solar power industry can quickly increase production value，
[Speaker 0]:  thus creating political achievements during their term ment office。
[Speaker 0]:  as for the subsidy costs，
[Speaker 0]:  they completely rely on the central government's taatry funds，
[Speaker 0]:  providing local governments with seemingly unlimited funds。
[Speaker 0]:  even with the menmarket market，
[Speaker 0]:  jeds proviking making solar power companies will not voluntarily withraraw，
[Speaker 0]:  hoping other local governments will fail first and and they can can hold out until the end。
[Speaker 0]:  this is similar to the mentality of borrowing money to build vantity projects in the past。
[Speaker 0]:  local governments don't believe they can make money，
[Speaker 0]:  but rather that other local government financing platforms will encounter problems first。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  after twenty twenty four，
[Speaker 0]:  the pressure became too great，
[Speaker 0]:  and some raralocal local governments finally realized the seriousness of the situation they were vvinced。
[Speaker 0]:  the the final outcome would not be other local governgovernments investments would fail first，
[Speaker 0]:  but that the entire industry would collapse。
[Speaker 0]:  at this point，
[Speaker 0]:  the government became anxious to recover the subsidy funds。
[Speaker 0]:  please read a piece of news from twenty twenty six。
[Speaker 0]:  on january twenty third，
[Speaker 0]:  the jjjo municipal people's government issued an administate tive decision ordering ST mebang to return five hundred ten million uon in financial subsities in construction funds to the wojo goushing district in guangangxi and to pay fifty one million u on in liquidated damages guantjuncounisissued ananounouncement。
[Speaker 0]:  regarding the first listed，
[Speaker 0]:  lar，
[Speaker 0]:  lar pocompany stained ing up toelectronics stained due to the failure to implement the woojo solar power project construction。
[Speaker 0]:  the relevant investment agreement was terminated and one hundred forty million u。
[Speaker 0]:  on in investment funds were recovered on january fifth，
[Speaker 0]:  a jate oned enterpriment in suzji applied for deadrestructuring of its subsidiary，
[Speaker 0]:  which had invested three hundred million u on in a tourism company because the tourism company failed to complete the repurchase on time。
[Speaker 0]:  the state one enterprise demanded three，
[Speaker 0]:  twenty six million u。
[Speaker 0]:  on in compensation。
[Speaker 0]:  for the past few years，
[Speaker 0]:  the tax new studio has been focusing on local local debt reporting extensively on many cultural and tourism projects and ineeffective infrastructure projects。
[Speaker 0]:  some yours may have already noticed that the logic of local governments borrowing money to develop tourism seven or eight years ago is exactly the same as the logic of invedustment back projects in the past few years。
[Speaker 0]:  this is not surprising because the companies investing in cultural and tourism projects and the companies investing in government back projejects are kely to invethe in group of projeies according to the paper starting in janual invetwenty。
[Speaker 0]:  four more than two hundred state own enterprises transform into industrial investment companies and two thousand newly established state on enterprises nationwide in twenty twenty four，
[Speaker 0]:  all involved in the dudustal al invements。
[Speaker 0]:  many state one enterprised assets have been transferred interrectly enended up in the hands industrial al investment platforms。
[Speaker 0]:  for example，
[Speaker 0]:  in april last year，
[Speaker 0]:  the state one enterprising in shangrow unconditionally transferred chairs in iahoa toism company limited to an industrial investment platform。
[Speaker 0]:  let's take liny。
[Speaker 0]:  shadoon is an example。
[Speaker 0]:  this is a typical city where state oenenpriprised debt has openly become a problem。
[Speaker 0]:  please read the news report from march twenty four，
[Speaker 0]:  twenty dead five from defing news。
[Speaker 0]:  mister gaw is from inner mongolia on february eleven，
[Speaker 0]:  twenty gutwenty three。
[Speaker 0]:  he purchased bonds issued by shandon linnguguox and infrastructure construction company limited。
[Speaker 0]:  judging from the issuance of this linei bond，
[Speaker 0]:  the funds were intended for the construction of the june county matmaternal and child health care service centre and were guaranteed by the june in county。
[Speaker 0]:  urban construction investment group company limited a typical example of multiple guarantees，
[Speaker 0]:  which is highly misleading to investors。
[Speaker 0]:  if it were a general enterprise，
[Speaker 0]:  most residents would not purchased。
[Speaker 0]:  mister ggsaid said，
[Speaker 0]:  according to the aginciment。
[Speaker 0]:  after two years，
[Speaker 0]:  they they return n all princiciple，
[Speaker 0]:  but they only return one percent of the principal each month。
[Speaker 0]:  mister gaw also reported this to the june county government。
[Speaker 0]:  the staff said that the matter of returning the bond principle was being processed currently，
[Speaker 0]:  only one percent of the principal can be returned each month。
[Speaker 0]:  mister gawl hopelessly said，
[Speaker 0]:  i don't want the quarterly interest anymore。
[Speaker 0]:  just give me the principle back by early twenty twenty five。
[Speaker 0]:  the interest rates for bank time deposits had generally fallen below one point five percent。
[Speaker 0]:  the old one group borrowed money at the nine perent ent annual interest raate and in end end even even repay。
[Speaker 0]:  the principle，
[Speaker 0]:  this is the final situation of the group's financial platform。
[Speaker 0]:  then let me read another news article from the keoof evening news account in twenty twenty six，
[Speaker 0]:  titled exploring industry，
[Speaker 0]:  enabling development in the middof of reform，
[Speaker 0]:  o，
[Speaker 0]:  one group's transformation in recent years，
[Speaker 0]:  in chchunu u。
[Speaker 0]:  group，
[Speaker 0]:  with its pioneer，
[Speaker 0]:  encourage and persistent efforts has enhanced development vitality through reform，
[Speaker 0]:  and expanded its development space through transformation，
[Speaker 0]:  gradually growing from a government investment and financing platform，
[Speaker 0]:  deeply involved in urban construction to an industrial operation platform，
[Speaker 0]:  enabling industrial operating。
[Speaker 0]:  this innovative approach has revitalized capital platforms and regional resourof precisely introducing high quality projects to the three major industrial parks and making the transformation path of chengdu，
[Speaker 0]:  becoming an industrial leader increasingly clear of group people under a different banner invested money in government back industries，
[Speaker 0]:  again，
[Speaker 0]:  continuto to ursusushshtern political achievements。
[Speaker 0]:  this mentality dominating investment。
[Speaker 0]:  it's not surprising that anything could happen。
[Speaker 0]:  therefore，
[Speaker 0]:  the state must cut off excessive export tax rebates and breaks the internal competition mechanism of local financing platforms。
[Speaker 0]:  in december twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 0]:  the export tax rebate rate for some chinese photovtake products products reduced from thirteen percent to nine percent。
[Speaker 0]:  and now the complete cancellation of tax rebates is entirely expected，
[Speaker 0]:  as for whether cancelling tax rebates will affect the chinese photovtatake industry，
[Speaker 0]:  we can remain optimistic。
[Speaker 0]:  the revelopment of the photovall take industry back。
[Speaker 0]:  there was critically influence on european anti dumping sanctions，
[Speaker 0]:  forcing chinese companies to stop relying on cheap labor and government subsidies to make money after the banqucurity of leadading companies。
[Speaker 0]:  the chinese phoval tatake industry actually established the technological advantage。
[Speaker 0]:  this，
[Speaker 0]:  this round of strustruturturchinese companies should understand that the purpose of market competition should be to make money not to rely on luck，
[Speaker 0]:  acknowledged outcompete and kill off chinese tourism industry。
[Speaker 0]:  the tourism duststry has gone down this road in twenty twenty four。
[Speaker 0]:  the ministry of finance cancelled export tax rebates，
[Speaker 0]:  the tourism industry。
[Speaker 0]:  at that time，
[Speaker 0]:  the tourism in hospitality market with similar to government run industry，
[Speaker 0]:  domestic overcapacity was sustained by export tax rebates to compete for overseas orders。
[Speaker 0]:  many companies traded below cost in the past year，
[Speaker 0]:  chinese tourism industry did not have taxx rebate benefits，
[Speaker 0]:  accumulative exports of aluminum and aluminum products，
[Speaker 0]:  total ten point eight，
[Speaker 0]:  one million tonons，
[Speaker 0]:  a slight decrease of zero point six five percent。
[Speaker 0]:  this shows that if a chinese industry truly possesses a competitive advantage，
[Speaker 0]:  reducing preferential policies is actually a good thing compared to the tours of industry。
[Speaker 0]:  chinese photo able take industry has an even greater advantage。
[Speaker 0]:  it has no short term competiors in the international market。
[Speaker 0]:  it to oolishing tax rebates is even better。
[Speaker 0]:  in the past。
[Speaker 0]:  local governments use investment platforms to fun projects like water，
[Speaker 0]:  parts and luxury buildings。
[Speaker 0]:  today，
[Speaker 0]:  the logic of a level internal competition among local government investment platforms is the same。
[Speaker 0]:  in the initial stage。
[Speaker 0]:  they leverage chinese established industry environment to quickly generate GDP and political achievements。
[Speaker 0]:  in the next stage。
[Speaker 0]:  they rely on the central government's limited creit，
[Speaker 0]:  hoping that the central government's finances will bail them out。
[Speaker 0]:  the only way way to make market mechanisms work again is to hold the heads of government investment platforms accountable for their decisions for life。
[Speaker 0]:  even after leaving office，
[Speaker 0]:  they should be responsible for the decisions made during their tenure regarding your previous discussion on chinese new energy vehicles and your recognition of the positive role of government investment in subsidies，
[Speaker 0]:  government obinvement platforms are subject to lifelong accountability。
[Speaker 0]:  will it discourage the enthusiasm of local governments？
[Speaker 0]:  government investment is necessary，
[Speaker 0]:  and investment also carries a certain degree of risk。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  since local officials benefit from successful invements ments，
[Speaker 0]:  even before knoknowwhether，
[Speaker 0]:  an investment is successful，
[Speaker 0]:  they have already received political achievements based on the resulting GDP。
[Speaker 0]:  and employment figures，
[Speaker 0]:  they have an obligation to bear some responsibility for failed investments，
[Speaker 0]:  nobody's asking these decision makers to personally compensate for losses，
[Speaker 0]:  but it cannot be said that no one is responsible for failed investments。
[Speaker 0]:  at the very least，
[Speaker 0]:  investment failures should recrecorded in their peronal al rements ments。
[Speaker 0]:  the other hand，
[Speaker 0]:  implementing a lifelong accountability system doesn't necessarily mean being neceaccountable for negative invecomes。
[Speaker 0]:  it may actually provide more room for error example invecerment investment。
[Speaker 0]:  they didn't make money initially，
[Speaker 0]:  but started making money later can still be considered in achievement for the officials involved。
[Speaker 0]:  if some officials think that lifelong accountability is detrimental to them，
[Speaker 0]:  it shows that they are well aware of what they did during their tenure。
[Speaker 0]:  the greatest benefit of a market economy is not necessarily selecting the best companies，
[Speaker 0]:  because random is always exists，
[Speaker 0]:  and many excellent companies may fail in the competiies。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  a market economy must be able to eliminate ate titively backard companies，
[Speaker 0]:  forcing them into bankruppcy emergcurcurtly，
[Speaker 0]:  a finfinccing platforms with the previous municipal investment companies or the current industry。
[Speaker 0]:  investment companies can first build credit of local governments，
[Speaker 0]:  and then indirectly utilizthe unlimited credit of the central government，
[Speaker 0]:  refusing to access the market。
[Speaker 0]:  this is the biggest problem。
[Speaker 0]:  if a lifetime accountability system can suppress these investments that shououldn't exist in the first place，
[Speaker 0]:  it should be considered a good thing。
[Speaker 0]:  finally，
[Speaker 0]:  before the program aared a view's knowledge requerereded me me that focucus interview on juutwenty twenty th contained a long awaited critique of local policies。
[Speaker 0]:  let's directly look at the political bias of the person involved in the hohost，
[Speaker 0]:  the end end of proprogram，
[Speaker 0]:  who regarded visible projects as visible political achievements。
[Speaker 0]:  even with tight financial capacity，
[Speaker 0]:  they still promoted high intensity investment。
[Speaker 0]:  this incident also gives us a profound lesson。
[Speaker 0]:  we insist on prioritising safety and major project assessments，
[Speaker 0]:  making whether it is necessary feasible and financially sustainable as preconditions to prevent similar incidents。
[Speaker 0]:  but a periperiod of rectification。
[Speaker 0]:  this industrial park project，
[Speaker 0]:  which was caused by serious political and official misaslimnment and blind d accumulation is slowly improving。
[Speaker 0]:  however，
[Speaker 0]:  the resulting waste resources and financial burden will take a long time to alleviate local industrial development is understandable，
[Speaker 0]:  but it cannot be used as a pretext for record exexpansion bllkely，
