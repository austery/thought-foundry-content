You're
 listening
 to
 Mistreated.
 I'm
 Nam


Kiwanuka.
 Until
 recently,
 menopause
 was


a
 whisper
 between
 friends
 and
 trusted


ones.
 Impolite
 company.
 It
 was
 called


the
 change.
 And
 if
 you
 were
 going


through
 this
 change,
 there
 was
 an


unspoken
 secrecy
 about
 saying
 that
 you


were.
 This
 stigma
 still
 exists
 in
 some


communities.
 But
 in
 2024,
 Oscar
 winning


actress
 Halib
 Berry
 helped
 to
 shatter


that
 silence.
 While
 on
 Capitol
 Hill,
 she


declared
 that


>> I'M
 IN
 MENOPAUSE.


OKAY,
 the
 shame
 has
 to
 be
 taken
 out
 of


menopause.
 We
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 this


very
 normal
 part
 of
 our
 life
 that


happens.
 Our
 doctors
 can't
 even
 say
 the


word
 to
 us,
 let
 alone
 walk
 us
 through


the
 journey.
 According
 to
 the
 Yale


Medical
 School,
 menopause
 is
 defined
 by


12
 consecutive
 months
 without
 a
 period.


But
 many
 people
 don't
 recognize
 that


ovarian
 function
 begins
 to
 decline
 long


before
 menopause,
 even
 in
 some
 cases
 up


to
 10
 years
 earlier.
 This
 transition


time
 is
 called
 perry
 menopause.


The
 menopause
 transition
 is
 more
 than


just
 hot
 flashes
 and
 forgetfulness.


According
 to
 the
 conversation,
 an


independent
 online
 publication
 from
 the


academic
 and
 research
 community,
 up
 to


80%
 of
 women
 develop
 symptoms
 linked
 to


falling
 levels
 of
 estrogen,


progesterone,
 and
 testosterone.


Researchers
 have
 identified
 more
 than
 40


possible
 symptoms.
 Because
 estrogen
 acts


on
 receptors
 throughout
 the
 body,
 its


loss
 is
 associated
 with
 increased
 risks


of
 long-term
 health
 issues
 such
 as


osteoporosis,


heart
 disease,
 diabetes,
 and
 mood


disorders.
 While
 the
 menopause
 market
 is


expected
 to
 be
 worth
 $600
 billion
 by


2030,
 many
 going
 through
 the
 transition


still
 lack
 access
 to
 getting
 the
 care


they
 need.
 On
 today's
 episode,
 we
 speak


to
 Dr.
 for
 Wendy
 Wolfman,
 a
 pioneer
 in


Canada
 and
 an
 internationally
 renowned


menopause
 expert.
 We
 speak
 to
 her
 about


why
 she
 became
 a
 doctor,
 the
 stigma
 of


menopause,
 and
 the
 lack
 of
 care
 for


women
 in
 health,
 and
 about
 the
 center


for
 mature
 women,
 which
 is
 set
 to
 open


in
 2027.


The
 center
 she
 says
 is
 a
 quote
 dream


realized.
 Dr.
 Wolfman
 joins
 me
 now.


Dr.
 Wendy
 Wolfman,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


taking
 the
 time
 to
 speak
 with
 us.
 Could


you
 introduce
 yourself,
 please?


>> I'm
 Wendy
 Wolfman.
 I'm
 director
 of
 the


Weston
 Oborn
 Center
 for
 Mature
 Women's


Health
 and
 Premature
 Ovarian


Insufficiency.
 I'm
 a
 professor
 in
 the


department
 of
 abstetrics
 and
 gynecology


and
 the
 first
 Carol
 Mitchell
 chair
 in


menopause.
 You
 have
 had
 a
 phenomenal


career.
 You're
 a
 trailblazer
 not
 just
 in


Canada
 but
 globally.
 Um
 I
 wanted
 to
 talk


to
 you
 maybe
 about
 your
 journey
 and
 how


you
 came
 to
 do
 the
 work
 that
 you
 are


doing
 right
 now.
 What
 were
 you
 taught


about
 women's
 health
 when
 you
 were


growing
 up?


>> Not
 much


but
 then
 I
 came
 from
 a
 family
 um
 which


maybe
 wasn't
 the
 typical
 family
 just


like
 everybody
 says.
 Um,
 my
 father
 had


polio
 when
 he
 was
 28
 and
 he
 was
 mobility


impaired
 and
 really
 I
 recognized
 at
 that


time
 that
 health
 was
 more
 important
 than


anything
 else.
 But
 I
 think
 we


concentrated
 on
 survival
 and
 my
 mother


did
 everything
 with
 him.
 um
 never


complained
 and
 so
 she
 really
 never


talked
 about
 those
 symptoms
 that
 may


have
 occurred
 in
 the
 pmenopause


and
 I
 have
 to
 say
 that
 anything
 that
 we


experienced
 seemed
 to
 pale
 besides
 what


my
 father
 had
 gone
 through.
 So
 growing


up
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 talked
 at
 all
 about


that.
 We
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 maybe
 in


school
 about
 um
 uh
 puberty,
 nothing


about
 menopause


>> and
 it
 wasn't
 talked
 about.


>> How
 and
 why
 did
 you
 become
 a
 doctor?


>> I
 think
 that
 was
 the
 major
 reason
 is
 I
 I


saw
 how
 health
 affected
 every
 aspect
 of


my
 family's
 life
 socially,
 economically,


um
 how
 hard
 they
 had
 to
 work
 for


everything.
 um
 the
 really
 the


discrimination
 at
 that
 time
 of
 people


who
 had
 a
 visible
 disability
 and
 I


didn't
 want
 any
 other
 family
 to
 have
 to


go
 through
 that.
 And
 so
 um
 I
 also
 grew


up
 at
 a
 time
 when
 women
 were
 being
 given


privileges
 that
 they
 had
 never
 been


before.
 And
 so
 also
 in
 within
 my
 family,


my
 father
 and
 mother
 were
 wonderful


parents
 and
 really
 encouraged
 me
 in
 any


way
 they
 could
 and
 there
 was
 no


limitation
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 I
 could
 do


as
 a
 woman.
 And
 then
 the
 Canadian
 uh


education
 system
 in
 Toronto
 um
 was


excellent
 and
 I
 received
 a
 wonderful


education
 in
 the
 public
 school
 system


and
 even
 university
 if
 I
 got
 a
 job
 in


the
 summer
 got
 scholarships
 it
 wasn't
 uh


really
 a
 burden
 that
 I
 couldn't


accomplish
 and
 then
 being
 a
 good
 student


I
 got
 into
 all
 the
 schools
 I
 applied
 for


and
 um
 so
 I
 I
 just
 it
 it
 It's
 really
 a


process.
 I
 think
 that
 I
 didn't
 really


define
 women's
 health
 per
 se
 until
 um


really
 I
 got
 into
 medical
 school
 trying


to
 decide
 what
 I
 want
 to
 do.
 Um
 I
 got


married
 at
 a
 very
 young
 age
 and
 my


husband
 was
 always
 a
 support
 to
 me.
 He's


also
 a
 physician
 and
 I
 had
 in
 undergrad


worked
 with
 Dr.
 Woliver
 at
 that
 time
 and


had
 done
 some
 basic
 science
 in
 the
 uh


reproductive
 hormones
 and
 I
 being
 a


person
 who
 really
 liked
 to
 figure
 out


everything
 um
 I
 really
 thought
 that
 was


fascinating.


>> And
 is
 that
 why
 you
 chose
 obstetrics
 and


gynecology?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that
 was
 part
 of
 it
 and


then
 I
 did
 a
 year
 of
 internal
 medicine.


I
 had
 after
 I
 got
 married
 I
 moved
 I
 got


into
 the
 University
 of
 Toronto
 but
 then


I
 moved
 to
 Calgary
 graduated
 from
 the


University
 of
 Calgary
 in
 medicine
 and
 I


did
 a
 year
 of
 internal
 medicine
 because


I
 thought
 I
 would
 do
 reproductive


endocrinology
 through
 internal
 medicine


but
 then
 I
 realized
 I
 wasn't
 really


comfortable
 looking
 after
 men
 and
 so
 uh


I
 decided
 to
 do
 that
 through
 OBGYn


and
 then
 you
 really
 get
 seduced
 for
 a


time
 with
 um
 pregnancy,
 birth,
 uh
 I
 had


quite
 good
 manual
 dexterity,
 the


surgical
 aspects
 of
 gynecology,


but
 then
 I
 realized
 that
 there
 was
 this


whole
 group
 of
 women
 that
 were
 not
 being


addressed.
 It
 was
 almost
 as
 if
 women's


lives
 stopped
 when
 they
 became


post-reroductive.


And
 when
 I
 was
 at
 uh
 UHN
 at
 that
 time
 um


um
 Toronto
 um
 there
 was
 a
 doctor
 there


named
 Dr.
 Plunkett
 and
 he
 was
 a


reproductive
 endocrinologist
 and
 he
 had


started
 a
 very
 small
 clinic
 for
 aging


women
 and
 it
 was
 sort
 of
 the
 loser
 place


where
 OBGYn
 went
 for
 women
 who
 were


complaining
 about
 their
 hot
 flashes
 and


their
 vaginal
 dryness.
 In
 other
 words,


women
 that
 were
 malingering.
 It
 was


almost
 attributed
 to
 that.
 And
 I
 I


thought,
 well,
 there's
 got
 to
 be
 more
 to


this
 than
 that.
 And
 so
 I
 started
 to
 go


to
 meetings
 and
 I
 got
 I
 I
 thought,
 wow,


this
 is
 amazing.
 It's
 fascinating.
 Look


at
 all
 the
 changes
 that
 are
 occurring


around
 menopause.
 There's
 this
 idea
 that


when
 you're
 going
 through
 paramount,


it's
 like
 you're
 complaining.
 You're


just,
 you
 know,
 not
 tough
 enough.
 It's


all
 in
 your
 head.
 So
 can
 you
 take
 me


back
 to
 that
 moment
 when
 you
 realized


wait
 a
 minute
 there
 is
 something
 here


that
 we
 should
 um
 research
 and
 your


curiosity.
 Well,
 I
 think
 I
 recognized


that
 there
 was
 a
 huge
 gap
 in
 knowledge


as
 well
 as
 care
 and
 um
 I
 also
 realized


that
 people
 were
 living
 longer
 and
 we


now
 know
 that
 women
 live
 up
 to
 40%
 of


their
 lives
 after
 menopause


and
 also
 I
 think
 this
 has
 been
 an


evolution
 that
 you
 know
 women
 have
 gone


to
 the
 work
 place
 and
 we
 are
 very
 vital


members
 of
 the
 workforce
 and
 it
 takes


takes
 years
 to
 develop
 the
 skills
 um
 to


get
 to
 the
 top
 of
 your
 fields
 and
 then


for
 women
 who
 really
 have
 terrible


symptoms,
 they
 can't
 function.
 And
 so


we're
 losing
 approximately
 10%
 of
 women


will
 quit
 their
 job
 because
 of


menopausal
 symptoms.
 And
 for
 now
 also


there's
 fascination
 with
 all
 the
 changes


that
 are
 occurring
 around
 the
 perry


menopause
 in
 the
 year
 before
 the
 last


menstrual
 period.
 There's
 an


acceleration
 of
 bone
 loss.
 There's


changes
 in
 your
 lipids.
 There's
 changes


in
 your
 blood
 pressure.
 We're
 just


beginning
 to
 understand
 some
 of
 these


changes
 because
 really
 women's
 health


research
 didn't
 start
 until
 the
 1990s.


Um,
 I
 mean
 that's
 appalling
 when
 you


think
 about
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 recognized


this
 gap
 and
 I
 felt
 very
 strongly
 that


it
 was
 wrong
 and
 that
 the
 quality
 of


women's
 lives
 was
 being
 affected
 by
 this


lack
 of
 knowledge.
 And
 women
 contribute


so
 much
 to
 our
 countries,
 our
 families,


our
 partners,
 our
 children.
 We're
 the


backbone
 of
 society.
 And
 when
 we
 can't


function,
 then
 society
 doesn't
 function.


Um,
 you
 know,
 strong
 women
 are
 there
 for


everyone.


And
 then
 I
 personally
 also
 realized
 it.


If
 I
 went
 to
 a
 store,
 I
 was
 ignored


because
 I
 was
 older.
 I
 finally
 had


earned
 enough
 money
 to
 buy
 the
 products


and
 I'm
 being
 ignored.
 And
 I'm
 thinking


to
 these
 salespeople,
 why
 are
 you


ignoring
 me
 like
 I
 count
 too?


>> And
 so
 it's
 a
 type
 of
 discrimination.


Even
 I
 see
 it
 now
 today.
 I
 was
 walking


on
 the
 hallway,
 a
 young
 man
 walked
 past


me
 as
 if
 I
 didn't
 exist
 because
 I'm


older.
 And
 I
 think
 there's
 that
 subtle


discrimination
 that's
 occurring
 as
 well.


I'm
 glad
 that
 you
 talked
 about
 how
 it


impacts
 our
 overall
 health
 because
 if


you
 go
 to
 a
 doctor
 or
 if
 society
 tells


you
 that
 once
 you
 hit
 a
 certain
 age
 that


you're
 no
 longer
 of
 value


>> and
 then
 you
 start
 to
 feel
 different
 and


you
 have
 these
 symptoms
 and
 I
 don't


think
 anybody
 wants
 to
 come
 off
 as
 I'm


complaining
 but
 then
 you're
 put
 in
 a
 a


position
 to
 have
 to
 advocate
 for


yourself
 when
 you're
 talking
 to
 the


doctors
 and
 then
 maybe
 you
 start
 to
 feel


a
 bit
 like
 okay
 it's
 me
 it's
 my
 problem


it's
 my
 fault
 I
 just
 need
 to
 be
 mentally


stronger.


>> I
 absolutely
 agree
 with
 you
 and
 I
 think


when
 women
 express
 opinions
 strongly,


they're
 interpreted
 to
 be
 angry
 rather


than
 assertive
 and
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 a


problem
 with
 our
 society
 and
 how
 we


approach
 women
 in
 general.
 Um,
 so
 I


think
 over
 my
 lifetime
 I've
 really
 seen


an
 evolution
 in
 respect
 for
 these


symptoms.
 Part
 of
 that
 was
 the
 discovery


probably
 in
 the
 early
 2000s
 of
 uh
 the


mechanism
 for
 hot
 flashes.
 So
 we
 now


know
 that
 the
 reason
 people
 get
 a
 hot


flash,
 which
 is
 one
 of
 the
 most
 common


symptoms
 of
 the
 menopause,
 is
 because


there's
 an
 inappropriate
 stimulation
 of


your
 uh
 thermostat
 in
 your
 brain.
 And


being
 a
 mammal,
 you're
 obligated
 to
 keep


your
 temperature
 within
 a
 narrow
 range.


And
 I
 learned
 that
 in
 grade
 two
 that


that's
 differentiates
 mammals
 from
 other


types
 of
 animals.
 And
 this
 area
 of
 your


brain
 when
 you
 don't
 have
 estrogen
 there


is
 inappropriately
 being
 stimulated


saying
 too
 hot,
 too
 hot,
 too
 hot.
 And


then
 your
 body
 under
 goes
 physiologic


changes
 to
 make
 you
 cool
 off
 by


sweating.
 And
 that
 involves
 changes
 in


your
 heart
 rate,
 changes
 in
 your
 blood


vessels.
 And
 this
 is
 not
 a
 trivial


event.
 And
 if
 a
 woman
 is
 having
 like
 20


of
 these
 a
 day,
 and
 most
 women,
 by
 the


way,
 when
 you
 put
 them
 in
 temperature


monitors,
 don't
 complain
 of
 all
 the


changes
 in
 temperature
 that
 they're


having.
 Um,
 so
 you
 can
 appreciate
 how


that
 would
 affect
 a
 woman,
 her
 ability


to
 function,
 and
 if
 they're
 occurring


all
 night,
 her
 sleep,
 which
 we
 know
 is


important,
 and
 how
 that
 impacts
 daily


function.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 discovery
 of


this
 mechanism
 for
 physicians
 really


validated
 these
 symptoms
 as
 not


malingering
 as
 being
 physiologic


and
 not
 I
 mean
 it
 is
 in
 women's
 heads


but
 not
 in
 the
 same
 way
 that
 had
 been


attributed
 before
 and
 so
 I
 think
 the


science
 has
 improved.
 I
 think
 women
 are


more
 viciferous
 and
 I
 think
 the


re-evaluation
 of
 the
 women's
 health


initiative
 which
 was
 that
 study
 in
 2002


that
 said
 that
 hormone
 therapy
 for
 all


women
 was
 very
 dangerous
 and
 increased


the
 risk
 of
 not
 only
 um
 cardiovascular


disease
 but
 breast
 cancer
 scared


physicians
 as
 well
 as
 women.
 Um,
 and


there
 were
 even
 lawsuits
 against


physicians
 for
 prescribing
 hormone


therapy
 at
 that
 time
 if
 women
 developed


breast
 cancer.
 So,
 I
 think
 we've
 come
 a


long
 way.
 We
 now
 know
 more
 about
 hormone


therapy.
 A
 re-evaluation
 of
 the
 WHI


shows
 that
 actually
 for
 women
 between
 50


and
 59
 who
 are
 the
 group
 that
 have
 the


most
 symptoms
 um
 that
 actually
 taking


hormone
 therapy
 is
 very
 safe
 and
 that


the
 benefits
 outweigh
 the
 risks.
 But


again,
 it's
 an
 individual
 prescription.


Uh
 has
 to
 be
 determined
 individually


looking
 at
 a
 woman's
 complete
 family


history,
 her
 own
 risk
 factors,
 and


whether
 she's
 a
 good
 candidate.
 I'm
 so


glad
 you
 spoke
 about
 that
 because


there's
 so
 much
 confusion
 about
 uh
 if


you
 can
 take
 um
 HRT
 and
 now
 I
 there's


also
 um
 people
 are
 changing
 the
 name
 to


menopause


>> hormone
 therapy
 and
 we
 reserve
 hormone


replacement
 therapy
 for
 women
 under
 40


who
 develop
 premature
 ovarian


insufficiency
 which
 we
 used
 to
 think
 was


1%
 of
 the
 population
 but
 actually
 is
 as


high
 as
 3.7%.


Um
 and
 we
 know
 that
 those
 women


absolutely
 need
 to
 take
 some
 form
 of


hormone
 or
 they
 will
 have
 earlier
 heart


disease
 and
 um
 earlier
 bone
 change,


earlier
 cognitive
 change.
 They're
 at


risk
 for
 long-term
 health
 issues
 if
 they


not
 replaced
 with
 the
 hormone
 that
 they


would
 have
 had
 if
 they
 hadn't
 developed


menopause
 earlier.


The
 FDA
 recently
 took
 the
 black
 box
 of


hormone
 replacement
 therapy.
 Can
 you


clarify
 on
 what
 women
 should
 be
 doing


moving
 forward?
 Obviously,
 after
 they


speak
 to
 their
 practitioner.
 So,
 we
 were


very
 happy
 that
 the
 black
 box
 was


removed.
 It
 scared
 a
 lot
 of
 women
 to


take
 hormone
 therapy,
 but
 I
 think
 again


it
 has
 to
 be
 looked
 at
 with
 the
 type
 of


hormone
 therapy.
 So
 we
 have
 vaginal


products
 which
 are
 utilized
 for
 symptoms


of
 um
 what
 we
 call
 general
 urinary


syndrome
 of
 menopause
 which
 are
 the


changes
 that
 occur
 in
 the
 vagina,
 the


vulva
 um
 the
 supports
 to
 the
 vagina
 and


the
 bladder
 and
 sexuality
 based
 on
 lack


of
 estrogen
 and
 50%
 of
 women
 have


symptoms
 within
 three
 years
 of
 menopause


and
 70%
 of
 women
 have
 symptoms
 by
 the


age
 of
 70.
 Those
 estrogen
 products
 are
 1


1,000th
 the
 potency
 of
 systemic
 hormone


therapy.
 So
 it's
 a
 teeny
 tiny
 bit
 of


estrogen
 and
 it
 works
 locally
 in
 the


vagina.
 And
 so
 there
 are
 now
 multiple


studies
 showing
 that
 there
 are
 no


long-term
 effects
 of
 vaginal
 estrogens


on
 heart
 on
 um
 it
 doesn't
 it's
 not


enough
 for
 treatment
 of
 symptoms
 um
 for


risk
 of
 breast
 cancer.
 Um
 it
 really
 is
 a


local
 product
 working
 locally.


Systemic
 hormone
 therapy
 now
 had
 the


blackbox
 removed
 in
 the
 US
 as
 well.
 Um,


for
 many
 of
 us,
 we
 think
 that's
 good.


But
 we
 still
 think
 that
 the
 person
 or


the
 people
 who
 are
 prescribing
 that


therapy
 should
 treat
 systemic
 therapy


with
 respect
 and
 recognize
 that
 the
 use


of
 hormone
 therapy
 um
 is
 an
 individual


prescription
 based
 on
 the
 person's


family
 history,
 their
 past
 history,
 um


their
 own
 personal
 risk
 factors.
 And


then
 the
 choice
 of
 how
 you
 decide
 to


prescribe
 it
 may
 be
 determined
 by
 your


health
 risks.
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 there


should
 be
 a
 menopausal
 health


assessment.
 We
 don't
 even
 have
 a
 fee


code
 for
 menopause
 and
 this
 dissuades


physicians
 from
 spending
 the
 amount
 of


time
 that
 is
 necessary
 to
 evaluate
 a


menopausal
 woman.
 Why
 do
 I
 say
 that?


I
 say
 it
 because


I
 think
 we
 can
 identify
 the
 risk
 factors


for
 women
 going
 forward
 after
 menopause


around
 menopause
 for
 many
 health


problems.


So
 for
 instance
 identifying
 the
 person


who's
 at
 risk
 for
 colon
 cancer,
 the


person
 who
 might
 be
 more
 at
 risk
 for


breast
 cancer
 if
 they
 have
 a
 family


history.
 Um
 so
 identifying
 first
 of
 all


those
 genetic
 risks
 then
 looking
 at
 a


woman's
 history
 um
 in
 terms
 of
 her


lifestyle.
 Um,
 we
 know
 that
 there
 are


the
 American
 Heart
 Association
 eight


healthy
 heart
 habits
 and
 that
 includes


normalizing
 weight,
 normalizing
 blood


pressure,
 blood
 sugar,
 lipids,


Mediterranean
 diet,
 regular
 exercise,


not
 smoking,
 and
 sleep.
 And
 if
 you
 can


normalize
 all
 those
 things,
 then
 you


will
 potentially
 have
 very
 good


cardiovascular
 health,
 which
 is
 a
 major


killer
 of
 women
 as
 they
 get
 older.
 So
 I


think
 reiterating
 those
 things
 and


emphasizing
 them
 to
 women
 is
 very


important.
 If
 the
 woman's
 having


symptoms
 like
 severe
 symptoms,
 we
 know


that
 that
 puts
 her
 more
 at
 risk
 um
 for


certain
 health
 problems.
 And
 we
 have


these
 good
 therapies.
 We
 have
 the


hormonal
 therapies.
 We
 now
 have
 some


excellent
 non
 hormonal
 therapies.
 Um
 and


the
 decision
 of
 whether
 that
 hormone
 can


be
 given
 orally
 or
 through
 the
 skin.
 Um


what
 type
 of
 progesterine
 is
 best
 to


prevent
 uterine
 cancer
 that
 comes
 from


unstimul
 un
 um
 opposed
 estrogen
 given
 to


women
 who
 still
 have
 a
 uterus.
 Um
 those


require
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 skill.
 When


people
 talk
 about
 the
 menopause


transition,
 it's
 like,
 "Oh,
 it's
 just
 a


hot
 flash."
 Like,
 it's
 something
 that's


cutesy,
 that's
 just
 something
 that
 is


not


>> it's
 trivialized.


>> That's
 the
 way,


>> right?
 Right.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 I've


explained
 that
 it's
 not
 trivial.
 That


actually
 is
 a
 physiologic
 event.
 If
 you


look
 statistically,
 about
 70%
 of
 women


or
 80%
 have
 some
 symptoms.
 20%
 do
 not.


And
 depending
 on
 the
 study
 that
 you


read,
 20
 to
 40%
 of
 women
 have
 at
 least


moderate
 to
 severe
 symptoms.
 Now,
 what


does
 a
 severe
 symptom
 mean?
 It
 means


that
 the
 woman
 has
 to
 stop
 what
 she's


doing.
 She
 can't
 continue
 on.
 The


symptom
 is
 so
 disruptive
 for
 her
 that


she
 can't
 carry
 on
 her
 daily
 life.
 Um,


some
 women
 have
 mild
 symptoms
 or
 no


symptoms
 and
 they
 don't
 know
 what
 people


are
 talking
 about.
 Can
 you
 talk
 to
 us


about
 what
 the
 center
 for
 mature
 women's


health
 is?
 Well,
 this
 has
 been
 amazing


towards
 the
 end
 of
 my
 life
 and
 my
 career


to
 actually
 have
 a
 dream
 realized
 and
 um


historically
 what
 happened
 in
 200
 uh


about
 20101
 I
 had
 a
 grateful
 patient
 who


came
 like
 an
 angel
 and
 said
 to
 me
 what


would
 you
 like
 to
 do
 and
 make
 a


difference
 and
 I
 said
 oh
 I'd
 love
 to


have
 a
 mature
 women's
 health
 center
 and


I
 made
 a
 a
 pitch
 to
 her
 and
 her
 husband


and
 they
 gave
 us
 a
 nice
 seed
 for
 um


establishing
 a
 chair
 and
 then
 she
 and
 I


together
 raised
 $3
 million


um
 towards
 uh
 a
 the
 first
 clinical
 uh


chair
 in
 mature
 women's
 health.
 Her
 name


was
 Carol
 Mitchell.
 She's
 still
 with
 us


thankfully
 and
 still
 believed
 in
 this


and
 this
 has
 been
 a
 goal
 for
 her
 as


well.
 Subsequently,
 my
 department
 chair


uh
 Matthew
 Surmer
 um
 recognized
 this


also
 as
 something
 important
 and
 so
 he


became
 an
 advocate
 at
 the
 hospital
 level


approached
 the
 board.
 Uh
 Maxine


Granowski
 was
 head
 of
 the
 board
 and
 the


board
 decided
 to
 make
 this
 an
 area
 of


interest
 for
 the
 hospital.
 They
 did
 a
 wa


worldwide
 search
 and
 I
 was
 chosen
 as
 the


director
 of
 the
 center
 and
 um
 then
 what


happened
 is
 they
 set
 a
 goal
 of
 $52


million
 towards
 a
 mature
 women's
 health


center
 and
 I
 thought
 uh
 we're
 never


going
 to
 do
 this
 like
 I
 I'll
 be
 dead
 and


gone
 before
 this
 is
 achieved
 and
 lo
 and


behold
 due
 to
 the
 wonderful
 donors
 from


our
 hospital
 as
 well
 as
 our
 great


foundation
 and
 all
 the
 people
 working


together
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 on
 our
 part


by
 the
 way.
 Um
 within
 two
 years
 we


raised
 $52
 million
 and
 no
 one
 would
 have


believed
 it.
 The
 last
 two
 donations
 are


named
 for
 the
 center,
 the
 Weston
 OORN


Center
 for
 Mature
 Women's
 Health,
 and


we're
 starting
 to
 make
 the
 plans,
 um,
 to


actually
 see
 a
 physical
 site.
 And
 so,


um,
 we've
 perceived
 as
 a
 center
 to
 be


really
 something
 unique
 for
 the
 world,


an
 example
 for
 mature
 women
 around
 the


world.
 Now
 that
 I'm
 on
 the
 board
 of
 the


International
 Menopause
 Society
 and
 have


traveled
 all
 around
 the
 world
 and
 work


with
 these
 inspiring
 colleagues,
 I
 know


that
 we
 have
 one
 of
 the
 best
 centers


currently
 uh
 that
 I've
 developed
 over


this
 time
 frame.
 Uh
 we
 have
 a
 clinic
 for


breast
 cancer
 survivors,
 for
 women
 who


have
 graph
 versus
 host,
 patients
 who


have
 Turner's
 disease.
 uh
 we
 have
 2,200


patients
 waiting
 to
 see
 us
 and
 we
 have


multiple
 days
 where
 we
 see
 menopausal


patients.
 Um
 and
 how
 we
 perceive
 this


clinic
 is
 to
 have
 seven
 clinics
 of


excellence
 including
 menopause
 premature


ovarian
 insufficiency.
 We
 have
 the
 only


clinic
 in
 Canada
 for
 this
 group
 of
 women


who
 no
 one
 talks
 about
 and
 that's
 I'd


love
 to
 speak
 to
 you
 at
 detail
 about


this.
 Um
 also
 women
 with
 abnormal


uterine
 bleeding
 that's
 a
 very
 common


presenting
 problem
 in
 the
 perry


menopause.
 Uh
 sexuality
 clinic
 also
 not


probably
 addressed.
 Eurog
 gynecology
 the


um
 incontinence
 and
 bladder
 issues


affects
 so
 many
 women
 with
 aging.
 Um
 and


then
 um
 also
 vulvver
 disease
 which
 is


very
 common
 in
 women
 and
 we
 have
 a


vulvver
 expert
 with
 us
 and
 also
 uh


Amanda
 Selk
 who
 is
 really
 nationally


known.
 We're
 going
 to
 have


interdisiplinary
 and
 we've
 already


started
 talking
 to
 people
 within
 our


hospital
 for
 osteoporosis
 which
 becomes


a
 problem
 as
 women
 age
 psychiatric


issues
 because
 we
 know
 that
 that's
 also


a
 validated
 menopausal
 symptoms
 is
 mood


change
 around
 menopause.
 Um
 and
 then
 uh


we
 also
 have
 an
 association
 with


neurology
 because
 we
 know
 cognitive


change
 uh
 occurs
 more
 often
 in
 women
 and


we
 want
 to
 know
 does
 it
 really
 start


around
 menopause?
 Is
 this
 related
 to


hormonal
 change
 to
 the
 symptoms
 of


menopause
 and
 these
 things
 are
 being
 uh


so
 exciting
 really
 to
 be
 involved
 with


all
 these
 initiatives
 and
 many
 others


interdisciplinary
 partners.
 Um,
 and
 so


this
 is
 what
 we
 hope
 to
 achieve.
 Um,
 and


hopefully
 we've
 had
 a
 finish
 date
 by
 the


end
 of
 2027.


So
 we
 hope
 that
 we'll
 be
 able
 to
 do


that.
 I
 think
 back
 to
 your
 family
 from


when
 you
 were
 a
 young
 child
 and
 your


father
 had
 polio
 and
 the
 discrimination


that
 he
 faced
 and
 to
 for
 you
 to
 see
 your


dream
 realized
 in
 your
 quietest
 moments


having
 that
 dream
 realized
 where
 you
 are


advocating
 for
 so
 many
 people.
 Uh
 what


does
 this
 mean
 to
 you
 personally?


You
 know,
 I
 I
 I
 thank
 you
 for
 framing
 it


that
 way
 because
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 really


think
 that
 much
 about
 that.
 I
 just
 am


sort
 of
 a
 person
 who
 goes
 and
 and
 does


it.
 But
 yes,
 it
 does
 give
 me
 um
 I
 feel


fulfilled.
 I
 feel
 honored.
 Um
 I
 feel


that
 what
 my
 mother
 always
 wanted
 and


was
 really
 imbued
 in
 me
 is
 to
 make
 life


a
 better
 place.
 if
 you're
 here
 and


you're
 on
 this
 planet
 that
 we
 all
 should


try
 and
 achieve
 uh
 change
 for
 the


betterment
 of
 really
 humanity
 and
 I
 do


feel
 that
 I've
 made
 some
 small


contribution
 but
 I
 thank
 you
 for
 your


kind
 words
 coming
 from
 a
 socialized


medical
 system
 with
 all
 its
 faults
 one


of
 its
 wonderful
 things
 is
 that
 we
 don't


look
 to
 see
 what
 your
 insurance
 is
 when


you
 come
 in
 everybody
 is
 hopefully


treated
 with
 respect


and
 dignity
 and
 equity
 and
 that
 is
 a


philosophy
 that
 I've
 always
 had
 as
 a


physician.
 Um,
 and
 I
 feel
 so
 strongly


about
 it.
 Um,
 I
 know
 for
 my
 parents
 uh


when
 my
 father
 got
 sick,
 there
 wasn't


socialized
 medicine
 at
 that
 time.
 It
 was


very
 difficult
 for
 them
 and
 I
 it's


extremely
 important
 to
 me
 that
 we


maintain
 that
 high
 standard
 of
 care.
 Um,


that
 no
 woman
 is
 turned
 away.
 Um,
 but
 we


need
 more
 operating
 dollars
 to
 run
 the


center
 and
 um,
 we
 also
 need
 more
 staff


because
 of
 the
 demand.


>> What
 changes,
 improvements
 are
 you


seeing
 in
 how
 women's
 health
 is
 being


taught?


>> I
 wish
 I
 could
 say
 more.
 That's
 very


frustrating
 for
 me
 because
 I
 think
 the


universities
 and
 the
 medical
 schools


have
 been
 slow
 to
 catch
 on
 to
 this


>> and
 so
 we
 have
 tried
 to
 make
 inroads.
 We


do
 lectures.
 We
 have
 for
 myself
 I


started
 a
 clinical
 fellowship
 in
 for


obstitricians
 and
 gynecologists
 around


2005
 and
 I've
 trained
 probably
 about
 25


um
 clinical
 fellows
 in
 obstetrics
 and


gynecology
 who
 are
 located
 all
 around


the
 world
 and
 are
 teaching
 and
 providing


care
 for
 women
 and
 in
 that
 way
 I
 think


we've
 made
 a
 great
 contribution.
 When
 we


look
 at
 family
 practice,
 we
 have
 about


20
 family
 doctors
 rotate
 through
 our


center
 and
 we're
 hoping
 to
 have
 a
 closer


liaison
 with
 family
 practice
 and
 to


encourage
 them
 as
 leaders
 in
 this
 area.


We've
 trained
 some
 who
 I
 think
 are


future
 leaders
 um
 to
 really
 initiate
 the


educational
 aspects
 within
 family


practice.
 Uh
 we've
 tried
 to
 advocate
 at


the
 university
 level,
 at
 the
 residency


level.
 So
 we've
 tried
 um
 but
 I
 think


there's
 so
 much
 other
 curriculum
 that


has
 to
 be
 provided
 for
 medical
 students


that
 we
 get
 a
 very
 small
 portion.


>> Um
 it's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 make
 people


realize
 that
 every
 woman
 who
 has
 ovaries


who
 lives
 long
 enough
 will
 go
 through


menopause.


>> And
 I
 always
 say
 that
 that's
 over
 50%
 of


the
 population.
 and
 yet
 so
 little
 of


this
 um
 educational
 part
 is
 given
 to


studying
 that.


>> What
 do
 you
 think
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 to


address
 the
 stigma
 and
 also
 this
 idea


that
 women's
 health
 is
 niche?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that
 there
 has
 to
 be
 a


change
 in
 thought
 and
 I
 can
 say
 for


myself
 that
 after
 I
 had
 children
 and
 I'm


sort
 of
 moving
 on
 in
 my
 career
 and
 and


as
 I
 said
 it's
 a
 process.
 It
 wasn't
 all


of
 a
 sudden
 for
 me
 that
 I
 made
 my


biggest
 contribution
 after
 my
 menopause.


And
 I
 think
 if
 you
 look
 around
 in


Canada,
 many
 women
 who
 are
 post


reproductive
 are
 making
 huge


contributions
 to
 our
 society.
 And
 I


think
 we
 should
 be
 recognized
 for
 that.


And
 so
 I
 think
 there
 has
 to
 be
 a
 shift


in
 thought.


>> What
 has
 been
 the
 biggest
 change
 and


what
 excites
 you
 today
 about
 women's


health?


Well,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 exactly
 what
 we


were
 talking
 about
 that
 women
 are
 being


recognized
 more
 that
 there
 is
 less


stigma
 about
 menopause
 that
 over
 the


last
 few
 years
 there
 has
 been
 more


recognition.
 There's
 like
 this
 menopause


explosion


um
 and
 I
 think
 that
 has
 good
 parts
 and


bad
 parts
 and
 um
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 the


big
 change
 I've
 seen.
 What
 excites
 me


personally
 is
 the
 discovery
 of


physiology


of
 um
 aging
 and
 there's
 some
 data
 about


aging
 and
 age
 of
 menopause
 and
 genetic


aspects
 to
 that.
 That's
 I
 find
 that
 like


the
 mechanisms
 for
 me
 is
 the
 exciting


part
 figuring
 out
 why
 and
 why
 is
 this


happening
 and
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 and
 um
 I


mean
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 live
 another
 hundred


years
 to
 see
 all
 the
 changes
 and


advances
 that
 are
 going
 to
 occur.
 We've


relied
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 studies
 from
 the


United
 States.
 um
 the
 NIH
 was
 the
 one


that
 mandated
 that
 women
 be
 included
 in


clinical
 trials
 in
 1993
 and
 now
 we're


seeing
 how
 um
 there's
 a
 lack
 of
 funding


for
 women's
 health
 in
 the
 US.
 Is
 this
 an


opportunity
 for
 Canada
 maybe
 to
 step
 up


in
 that
 place?


>> It
 worries
 me
 greatly
 that
 there
 is
 lack


of
 funding
 or
 funding
 being
 removed
 in


the
 US
 for
 scientific
 studies
 because
 I


think
 we've
 seen
 so
 so
 many
 huge


advances
 based
 on
 that.
 Um
 yes
 it
 is
 a


big
 chance
 for
 Canada
 to
 try
 and
 take


some
 of
 those
 people
 uh
 from
 the
 US
 and


provide
 them
 with
 the
 opportunity
 to
 do


research.
 Um
 we
 the
 CIHR
 the
 Canadian


Institute
 for
 Health
 Research
 has


instituted
 in
 the
 last
 few
 years
 um
 some


women's
 health
 funding
 more
 than
 they


had
 before.
 Um,
 and
 so
 there
 are


competitive
 grants
 now
 in
 Canada
 being


provided
 for
 researchers.
 Um,


>> but
 it's
 still
 a
 small
 percentage.


>> It
 is
 a
 small
 percentage.
 Is
 it


>> like
 6%
 or
 7%?


>> Yes.
 So
 it's
 not
 huge
 when
 you're


looking
 at
 50%
 of
 the
 population.
 Um,


but
 yes,
 there
 is
 a
 change.
 Things
 are


moving
 along.
 Um,
 and
 I
 think
 we'll
 get


there.
 I'm
 optimistic.


>> Same.


>> Yeah.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 your
 time.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Appreciate
 it.
