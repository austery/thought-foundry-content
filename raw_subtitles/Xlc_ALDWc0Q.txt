OK, so if you can't tell already,
I'm from Texas.
(Cheers and applause)
And I also spent my career
in the oil and gas industry.
So do you hate me yet?
(Laughter)
Let's hope not.
So I went into oil and gas
because energy is life.
And I wanted to be able to provide people
with lights, air conditioning, heat,
and, of course, the ability to watch
funny cat videos on their phone.
(Laughter)
But energy also evolves.
So humans used to burn wood
for heat and light.
We then transitioned to whale oil
and to coal, and then to oil and gas.
But we're now using renewables,
like solar and wind.
And it's this exciting evolution
to clean, renewable energy
that inspired me to leave Shell
and start my own geothermal company
with my partners.
And so we're now using
that mud-on-your-boots know-how
from the oil and gas industry
to drill for heat
instead of for hydrocarbons.
So most people don't know this,
but there's a lot of heat
deep in the Earth.
And the deeper you drill,
the hotter it gets.
And this heat, this energy,
it's always on, it's clean,
and it actually holds
50,000 times more energy
than all of the oil and gas reserves
on the planet.
So why am I still talking
about oil and gas?
It's because we're going to take
the technologies
that the oil and gas have developed
over the last 100 years,
at a cost of trillions of dollars,
and we're going to start drilling
for heat instead of hydrocarbons.
So let's talk a little bit about drilling,
just to give you guys a basis on it.
Oil used to be found
in puddles on the ground.
So people figured out
that they could use it
to run machineries, cars, airplanes,
and the demand skyrocketed.
The oil line on the ground ran out
because people were using it.
So we started to dig.
So we dug deeper and deeper.
And despite what you
may have heard or think about,
you know, roughnecks and oil field work,
it's actually quite complex and technical.
The industry was able
to advance the technologies even more
to unlock oil that was
previously out of reach,
and at a cost the world could afford.
And so, using amazing innovation,
the industry learned how to basically
turn the bit sideways in the subsurface,
be able to drill horizontally
within the layers that actually
carried the oil and gas.
The industry also learned
how to frack the rock
to release oil that would have
otherwise been stuck in there.
And so I know,
not everybody's a fan of fracking,
but it really did bring in
an era of lower cost energy.
And I'll tell you in a minute why fracking
is important for geothermal energy.
So the oil and gas industry,
with all of this turning
and steering underground,
was able to drill deeper, drill hotter
and actually drill
with some pinpoint precision.
So, for example,
imagine hitting a target
the size of a pizza
at a depth of five miles
under the ground into the Earth,
and being able to do this
over and over again.
The technology is pretty amazing.
And so we are now going
to use that technology
for geothermal,
but we're not going to have to learn
over those 100 years,
so we can apply it straight away.
So you guys may ask,
why do we even need geothermal?
Because let's admit, wind and solar
have done a great job greening the grid.
Well geothermal can do
what wind and solar can’t,
and that is provide power
24 hours a day, seven days a week,
regardless of what the weather is.
You can also use geothermal
as a giant battery
to store extra energy from wind and solar,
and to make those intermittent
power resources baseload,
because we can then use
that extra energy during the day
when the sun is not shining
and the wind's not blowing.
And so where is the real prize
for geothermal?
So I think a lot of us know about Iceland
or the geysers in California,
where they've done a great job
of exploiting the shallow pools
of hot water that's
just below the surface.
The challenge with those areas
is that it's kind of
a unique, unicorn geology.
So the real prize in geothermal
is in rock that’s deep, hot,
so you're going to have to drill deeper.
So we call this
next-generation geothermal.
And that's where we're going.
And we're going there by drilling
deeper, hotter and horizontal.
And I would say that there are
several companies
that are racing toward this future.
Ours is one of them.
I'm proud to say that we are
not just talking about it.
We’re actually in the field,
drilling wells, building systems
and proving that geothermal
technology can work
in unassuming places like Texas.
Who had ever heard of geothermal in Texas?
It's there.
OK, I said I’d come back
to the f-word, fracking,
and why is it important to geothermal.
So in this deep, hot rock,
there's not a lot of cracks
for water to flow through.
And the way we get geothermal to work
is to flow water through fracks
to absorb the heat,
and then we use that water
to carry the heat to the surface.
And when you get that heat to the surface,
you can use it to drive turbines,
to power electricity,
or you can use the heat directly.
The reason why we use fracturing
is we can create those cracks in the rock,
or those pathways through which
the water can flow through.
So here is a picture of a frack operation.
This was actually at our well.
So what we do during fracking operations
is we are creating cracks in the rock
or we're widening cracks
that are already there,
and we're using it with a liquid
that is mainly water.
We do add crushed rock
called barite in the water
to make it more dense.
The thing I want to note
is that we're pumping at lower pressures
and lower rates
than the oil and gas industry,
and we're actually wanting to avoid
natural occurring faults.
And this allows us
to make our risk of earthquakes low.
We're not talking about technology
that's decades in the future.
This is footage from
our energy storage facility,
which is actually built at a coal plant.
This coal plant is delivering
people electricity 24 hours a day,
and they are making
the bold move to solar.
And it was -- without
our energy storage facility,
they're not able to make that move
because solar alone cannot
replace that power 24 hours a day.
And then soon we're going
to be powering a metadata center
with our next-generation
geothermal technologies.
Imagine again, Facebook,
Instagram, WhatsApp,
and, of course, funny cat videos
being powered by the Earth's heat.
So how big can this get and how fast?
If we're able to take
next-generation geothermal,
get the cost comparable
to other power sources,
we're going to be able
to use the geologist,
the drillers, the service companies,
the engineers from
the oil and gas industry
who are currently drilling
70,000 wells a year for oil and gas,
and instead have them drill for heat.
So the result -- by 2050,
we can deliver almost 80 percent
of the electricity demand
that the world needs
and over 100 percent 
of the heat for all homes,
all businesses on the planet.
(Applause)
So energy solved,
climate change solved,
that better future that our kids deserve.
I'm hoping this leaves you guys energized.
There's people like me
that are already working toward this end.
And the thing I want to leave you with
is that that energy is
everywhere beneath our feet.
We just need to tap into it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
