- [Producer] Rolling.
Okay, here we go.
Peter Leyden, take one, mark.
- We're living in an
extraordinary moment in history.
We are at a moment here in 2025
where we have world historic
game-changing technologies
now starting to scale.
Artificial intelligence,
clean energy technologies,
bioengineering, all here.
We're at the cusp of a potentially
a great era of progress.
But America and the world itself
are going through huge contortions.
Old systems of the past are collapsing,
and new systems of the
future are still to be born.
I call this moment the great progression.
I'm Pete Leyden.
I've been here in San
Francisco for 30 years.
I've basically been following
the story of technology,
and its evolution,
and looking ahead into how
it's gonna change the world
over the next 25 years.
And my current project right now
is looking at the great progression,
what I think is gonna be a
great era of great progress
from now until about the year 2050.
- [Interviewer] So Peter, let's start off
with something nice and straightforward.
Could you just describe for
us what was the Long Boom,
and maybe what pulled you
into this whole topic of human progress?
- Well, way back in the '90s
when the very beginning
of this digital revolution
and the earliest days of the internet,
there was really only
one place in the world
that was really all over that.
And that was Wired Magazine.
The founders of Wired picked up on me
as a kind of young journalist,
as someone who kind of had
the same kind of sensibility
about the transformative
nature of these technologies.
And so they wooed me to work with them
in the early days of Wired.
Now, what's interesting about those days
in the early part of that
was people had no idea
what was even going on
with the internet,
and literally what's
email, what's the web,
and there was stuff like that.
They had no idea how
these goofball startups
with names like Amazon were
ever gonna amount to anything.
There was all these naysayers
in the mainstream media
and pundits in the government
that were saying no
one in their right mind
is gonna put their credit
card on the internet.
I mean, we had all these
myths from the Wired era
of trying to explain
what was really coming
in the next 25 to 30 years.
And so what was interesting
is I was working with the founders there,
and we thought in the middle of the '90s,
there was a point where
someone had to breathe life
into what is a digital economy,
how is it different
from previous economies?
How could that scale and
really make a big difference?
How could it supersede
the current, you know,
conventional 20th century economy?
And the other thing that was
going on there beyond this,
the digital revolution,
and the beginnings of the internet
was essentially the
beginning of globalization.
And so those two things
that people at the time,
the mid '90s had no idea
what a big deal that was.
And so myself and a co-author,
which was Peter Schwartz,
who was probably the premier
futurist at the time,
he and I worked for
about a year it took us
to really build out
what was essentially a famous
iconic cover story at Wired
that was called "The Long Boom".
And it was a history of the future,
the story from 1980,
which was in our past,
to 2020, which was in our future,
written in the mid '90s there.
But we told it like we were
historians in the future
explaining this amazing era of essentially
that what we were going
through at the time.
Now, not all of it, in the mid '90s,
you can't predict everything right.
And by the way, we weren't
necessarily saying flat out,
it's a prediction.
We were saying, hey, these technologies,
these trends, like globalization
have the potential to do
many, many positive things.
And so The Long Boom was really skewed
towards the positive possibilities
of these technologies,
and this integration
of the global economy.
And so what we did lay
out there, I would argue,
is largely came to pass.
And in fact there's a lot
of ways to measure that.
And once we passed 2020,
there was all kinds of stories
that people kind of
checking back on our work.
There were many things that
were completely nailed.
We were saying, hey, the
doubling of computer chips
was gonna continue under
Moore's Law for 25 more years.
And it did.
When we wrote this, you know,
there were 25 million Americans
in the mid '90s on the internet.
And by 2020, we had, you
know, 60% of the world.
It's 4 billion people on it.
And so anyhow, a lot of the through lines
of what we were saying happened.
There were some minor
things that didn't happen.
We actually thought humans
would get to Mars by 2020.
We thought there was
enough energy towards that.
We thought there'd be
more progress honestly,
on climate change than
we ended up in the end.
But we didn't understand
the backlash to that
the way we've actually been struggling
for the last 20 years.
But in general, it was
very much a kind of vision
that actually people could really see,
and it really clicked with people,
and it actually energized
both the entrepreneurial
generation that was building it,
like they were inspiring
them to fill it out.
And then it also kind of helped people
outside the Silicon Valley,
and outside the Bay Area,
and outside California to understand,
oh my God, this is possible.
And if it's possible,
maybe we need to get with
the program and come along,
- [Interviewer] This isn't a new story
in America and globally.
And tell us how often
these epoch resets happen.
- Now, to really understand where we are
and where we're going,
you have to kind of
pull back a little bit,
and understand, at least
from my perspective,
how the world works.
And I think one of the things
that I think people can
really underestimate
is how foundational new technologies are
to kind of creating essentially
the context for a new world.
Now those of us who are in technology
and those of us who have
been immersed in it,
which I have been for
most of my career now,
can see clearly these
kind of incremental stages
of these new technologies,
that all successful new technologies
go through a technology adoption curve,
that essentially starts out
with very few innovators trying it,
and then some early
adopters who kind of use it.
Then there's a kind of
early majority of people
that start to think,
oh my god, this is an interesting thing.
And then the late majority think,
oh my god, my neighbor's doing this way,
I'm gonna take on with
that, and they grab on.
And then you eventually get to the point
where you even get the laggards.
Everybody in the society has to take on,
let's say, a color TV set,
because you can't even buy
a black and white TV set.
Like all technologies
have gone through this.
So those of us have kind of
are in the technology world,
have seen this over and over
and over again with technology.
And the key piece of
this is tipping points.
When do you go from the
slow, slow build of a thing
that's kind of clunky
and not really working,
and these cell phones don't really work,
till you all of a sudden
get an iPhone that goes,
holy shit, this is the most
amazing thing in the world,
and then everybody needs them.
And what I'm trying to tell you now
is we are in the middle
of three tipping points
that are world historic changes
that are happening around us today.
And the most obvious one
is the arrival of artificial intelligence.
Literally, this is the
biggest technological story
I have ever lived through.
It's going to go through the
roof of exponential growth,
and it's going to hit
all fields at some level.
'Cause anything people
do with intelligence,
you're gonna have to rethink,
is the machine gonna do this,
or is the human gonna do this?
And then the other thing about it is,
if the machines do enough
of it, we're gonna,
the humans are gonna take the
machines to augment themselves
and go to the next level of problems,
the next level of jobs,
a whole nother thing.
Anyhow, that's one tipping point.
There's another tipping point
which I won't go into the same detail,
but around clean energy technologies.
That solar, which has been
this incremental thing,
just like you know, the
internet or just like AI,
going through these
stages of still expensive,
kind of clunky, not really taken off,
has taken off big time
in the last 10 years.
And that thing is hitting
tipping points around the world,
and it is going to exponential growth.
And there's some other ways
we can talk about later
about bioengineering
and synthetic biology,
which is more complicated and
a little bit later than that.
But it is getting to the point now
where we can see in the next 25 years,
we're gonna be able to
engineer all living things.
And so these are huge
shifts in our technology.
And so getting back to the bigger picture,
what we're talking about
is once you give essentially a society,
an economy, a society, a people
those kind of technological powers,
it starts to essentially force
a transformation of the economy, society,
and just how things work.
And so the old system, how we did it all
through the 20th century,
and how it had worked really well,
and how all these people
were kind of tied into that
are essentially invested in that thing.
But that thing is getting dysfunctional,
it's getting along in the tooth.
And this goes everything from
carbon energy technologies,
which is causing climate change,
to essentially government bureaucracies
that can't work like they did, you know,
over the last 80 years
getting increasingly difficult to work.
So you're watching an old system
being essentially dismantled
or having to come down,
at the same time
as we're taking off on
these new technologies
to build the next systems.
We're in the middle of that.
Right now is smack in the
middle of that in our era,
but we've also seen this
in American history before.
There's been other areas
where this exact thing has happened.
We can kind of learn from
them if we look back.
There's been three previous junctures
where Americans have found
themselves in this exact place.
Now that's not to say it's common.
Like you know, this is 80 years
ago last time we saw this.
And they tend to come
in these 80 year cycles.
Many people might think, why 80 years?
What happens every 80 years?
Now, there's a lot of
things going on here.
One is there's usually a
set of new technologies
that are ready to take off
that are essentially
not under development,
but are essentially about to scale up.
And that you can go back in history
and show how that happened
in every one of these 80 year junctures.
There's also a kind of economic reason
of how essentially economies
boom into long booms
of technological booms,
but also economic booms
and then they die out.
But the one of the main reasons
is essentially that
comes up to a essentially
a changing the guard of generations.
And so there are some
lessons you can learn,
some patterns you can see there,
and some lessons we could learn
that'll help us kind of understand
what's really going around today
and what we need to do going forward.
The last big one was coming
off World War II, 1945.
It is exactly 80 years ago
from 2025 where we are here.
80 years ago, America was
on a very similar parallels.
And there's a bunch of
parallels around this.
One, we had basically were watching
the essentially dismantling
of the old world
that had been working pretty well,
the economy and societies of the west.
There had been a wave of new technologies,
there had been a boom around that.
And then there had been a crash
in the great crash of '29,
and you would run into the
Great Depression of the 1930s.
Now what that was was the old
system of running the economy
just wasn't working.
Huge inequalities, all these
kind of problems around that.
So you were watching essentially the need
to fundamentally reinvent the economy.
But before we get to the new system,
you get to the other pattern
of all these junctures.
You get extremely high
passionate politics.
And so what happens is
you watch these junctures
in American society,
we get super polarized around two visions
of essentially the way to go forward.
One is let's hang on to what we did,
or go back and make America
great again the way we did.
And there's another crew that says,
no, we gotta move forward and innovate
and be more progressive,
and kind of drive another progressive era.
And those junctures happen at these times,
and it gets extremely conflictual.
And to be fair, the 1930s in America,
people forget this part of America,
but there was an America first movement
that really took over
the Republican Party.
There were essentially
American level fascists
in the '30s,
and we were on the verge
of kind of violent conflict in America.
And then you had this kind of FDR,
and the kind of new deal coalition
that was kind of came
out of the Depression
that was pointing towards
a kind of different way
to run the economy and
the society post-war.
And they started to get traction.
But anyhow, we had resolve
this political tension in America,
and frankly it had to do it in the world,
because the world also is
going through this juncture.
And after the war though,
we watch the updraft of the next system.
And this is important to
know, yes, there's conflict,
yes, there's this kind of
collapse of the old system,
but what's amazing about these things
is they have bursts of
unbelievably widespread innovation
that lasts for, what
do you know, 25 years.
And so from 1945 to 1970,
we watched the great post-war boom,
many people call it the kind of
high point of global capitalism.
And you built this crazy economy
where you did many things
that were completely different
than the previous era.
Tax the rich at 90%.
You watch incredible investment
in public infrastructure
like the interstate highway
system and building suburbs.
You basically watch the
GI Bill in education,
building higher institution
for higher education,
expanding it for the Boomers,
all that kind of stuff.
That all happened in 25 years.
The Great Society, the
whole thing, 25 years,
and then we ran in the '70s,
it started kind of getting
along in the tooth,
and it wasn't kind of the
boom started running out.
Stagflation, oil shocks.
But here's the point,
that was a good example.
Within recent memory of, let's say,
my mother who is in that older generation,
where we watched a very similar thing.
All three of those pieces,
old system had to come down,
and got, wasn't working,
super conflict around it.
And ultimately the building of a thing
that was dramatically
different than before.
We've been through that before.
And funny enough, like I say,
if you go another 80 years back,
we did it once a time before that too.
So from 1945, you go
back exactly 80 years,
and it's 1865.
What is 1865?
It's the end of the American Civil War.
Now this is a good example of
how passions run very high,
and political conflict is
extreme at these junctures.
In the Civil War, it was the most extreme.
I mean we literally had to have
750,000 Americans died in the Civil War.
I mean, you talk about,
you know, you think,
hey, it's a little edgy now,
and we're a little worried about
political violence breaking out.
Yeah, we've been there.
I mean we've seen how that happens.
Now, what was going on there?
This is the probably the most
easiest way to understand
the old systems failing,
because America, since the founding,
had been in tension with
these two economic systems.
One was essentially a system
of the early manufacturing economy
where you needed free labor in the north
essentially to create an
economy that's, you know,
reminiscent of what we still have now.
But in the old South, we
basically had slavery.
And yes, there was a human
rights aspect to that,
but really it was an economic thing,
which is the powers at be,
political people and
economic powers of the South
were absolutely dependent on slavery.
They could not survive together.
We had to bring down finally and fully
essentially an economy
that was essentially based on slave labor.
There was immoral reasons for that,
but there was an economic reasons for it.
We had to stop that.
And when we decided to do
that, which is in the 1850s,
it started getting clear that
we're gonna have to do this.
One side, the South side
essentially seceded.
They said, no, we're not going there,
we're not gonna give it up.
We're not gonna let go of this old system,
we're gonna fight to
the death on the thing.
And they wanted to secede.
And then when we wouldn't let 'em secede,
they basically, we had the Civil War.
And so this is a good example.
There's a similar system
that has to go down,
in our era, I'll just say,
and let's just call it, carbon energy.
We cannot keep carbon energy going
the way we have for the last 250 years
of the Industrial Revolution
without destroying the planet.
And so what you're seeing through the lens
of that same kind of system
that must be dismantled,
you're watching the similar resistance
of anyone rooted in the oil economy,
whether it's oil petro-states,
whether it's regions of the country
that are rooted in that
in some of the red states
in the United States.
Whether it's, you know,
political platforms
of like, you know, trying to
kind of deny climate change.
The same thing is, it's
a similar kind of thing.
It isn't quite to Civil War now,
but you can see how old systems
that have to be dismantled,
there's a lot of people invested in that
are very resistant to shifting.
And so that we saw it in the Civil War.
Now the thing that people do
not know about the Civil War
don't really remember as
much about the Civil War
is the Civil War after 1865
had an unbelievable explosion of progress
that lasted for, what
do you know, 25 years.
The what they called the
the Republican Party,
which was the progressive
kind of side of that conflict,
not the conservative hold the
old thing, but move forward.
They passed some just
unbelievable landmark legislation.
For example, the Homestead Act,
which is you gave
anybody who went out west
to 150 acres, for free.
If you just went out there,
and basically helped tame the west.
There was also land grant universities
where they essentially
all these little states
started building institutes
of higher education
to educate average people
beyond the kind of
Harvards of the East Coast,
but also to be pushing
scientific understanding
of agriculture growing.
So there was a lot of governmental-driven
but also economic kind
of progress in that.
But there was, here's the other
progress that was going on.
It was technology.
The technology of that time
was essentially, think of it,
one of them is trains.
Before the Civil War, we had
trains just like, you know,
we had computers before the internet boom.
There are these beginnings
of these technologies,
but it was only in the Civil War
when we started to realize,
holy shit, we could
really scale these things.
It was only after the war
that America blew out
like 175,000 miles of rail
and essentially stitched the
entire continent together
across the whole continent,,
and stitched every town and everything,
cut together with this, you
know, steel-based rails.
And essentially we rebuilt America,
we reinvented America
in the next 25 years.
And here's the even crazier thing though.
You go back another 80
years, we did it again.
So you go from 1865, which
is the end of the Civil War,
and you go back 80 years.
The late 1780s, we essentially
started a 25 year boom.
And when you say boom, it's
like a technological boom,
it's an economic boom.
It's essentially upward swing
of a lot of widespread innovation
that America went through
coming off the Revolutionary War
to create the world
that by the end of the Founders Era,
after Thomas Jefferson had already been
a two term President and
all that kind of stuff.
By the kind of, you know, 1810, 1815,
we had created what is America,
which kind of was then rolling
until the Civil War period.
So there was this kind
of creation at that side,
and then there's another thing about it
that people forget is there were loyalists
in the fight around the Revolutionary War.
There was a significant
amount of Americans
who were loyalists, who
were fighting for the Crown,
who were fighting for the British.
And that had a lot to lose
because they benefited
from the colonial situation
that essentially had been the system,
the old system of that time.
And that it was the revolutionary
side of the Americans
who were trying essentially
the progressive side
that had to fight in the war.
I mean, we had Americans
on the British side.
I mean, we had real debates on this thing
on a fundamental level.
And that political debate
got settled in the war,
and then we basically started
the building of America.
So it was really one way to understand
what was happening in America at that time
was it was part of a bigger
part of Western Europe,
and particularly an extension of Britain,
which was going through the
enlightenment at the time,
that essentially has global implications.
It was a fundamental system change
from a feudal society,
kind of dominated by the Catholic church
and all kind of stuff,
into essentially what
we would now consider
the modern world.
And they invented six huge things
that we still are working within today.
One was they invented mechanical engines.
I mean, that was essentially,
we essentially could
amplify human physical power
like never before
by essentially harnessing steam engines
to kind of scale up our powers.
That was huge.
The second thing we did
is we essentially invented
large scale carbon energies,
mining coal to actually
create giant furnaces
to kind of create an
industrial production.
That was a breakthrough,
and we've gone on to coal,
natural gas since then.
Third thing is industrial production.
For the first time we were able
to scale at unbelievable scale,
essentially the production
of industrial goods,
which has essentially created
the prosperity and wealth
of the world that we know now.
We also invented financial capitalism.
Before that time, people
couldn't take money,
their little gold pieces,
and they never, they
couldn't trust sending it
into somebody in another
country that would,
you know, protect that thing.
There was no financial capitalism
until essentially Great
Britain invented it.
And you had a trustworthy system
that investors could
actually put their money
due to the scale of the
Industrial Revolution.
The final two things
were the nation state.
You know, before that, we had
empires and colonial things,
but we didn't, colonies,
we didn't have the nation state
system which they created.
And the final one was
representative democracy,
which we've mentioned how
the United States did that.
Now the reason I'm kind of saying that
is that had world historic
kind of implications.
That was a building of a civilization,
that was an integrated civilization
that the world had never seen before,
that we essentially invented, we humans,
but we, western Europe in
basically a space of 120 years.
America took the mantle
at the end of that,
the late 18th century, 1776 and 1780s,
kind of rolling into the 19th century.
The forward motion of innovation,
essentially from the west
was coming with those crazy ass Americans,
who had this wide open
continent to spread it to,
and had this crazy opportunity
to just do whatever the
hell they wanted to do.
They didn't have a aristocracy,
they didn't have the whole place
owned by the old rich that
have been in for centuries.
They had a lot of open space
to just create and innovate
and create new things.
And that is what America's role
has been vis-a-vis the West
in every one of those epics.
Then Europe followed
and kind of emulated and
had their own welfare states
and various things,
and they did, you know, enough innovation.
I don't want to say it was all America,
but America was the 800 pound gorilla
in driving innovation going forward.
I'm arguing, we're, we have
one more crank of that wheel.
And I think the place to look right now
for this next big innovation,
this next reinvention,
not just of America,
but potentially
civilizational scale invention
is gonna basically come out of America.
Again, it's not 100% true,
there's a lot of drama
and difficulty right now,
but I would say if you had
to compare us to China or others,
I think what you're gonna see
is America going through one more level
of that scale of change.
- [Interviewer] That actually drives us
right into this next sort of second part.
Let's get into the future
that we are sort of currently living in,
whether everyone realizes or not,
let's start with the one
that we are seeing and
hearing about constantly,
which is AI.
- We are in the middle
of three tipping points
that are world historic changes
that are happening around us today.
And the most obvious one
is the arrival of artificial intelligence.
The arrival of generative AI
with the arrival of ChatGPT
3.5 in November of 2022.
I think we're gonna see that
as a world historic moment.
I think people will look back
on that is the starting gun
of what will be understood
as the age of AI.
And I use age in a very,
you know, explicit way,
which is when you talk
about a different age
that humans enter,
like, oh, the humans, you know,
entered the Bronze Age or the Iron Age.
I mean you're talking about essentially
a fundamental game changing
technology, a breakthrough,
a step change in our abilities
that once you cross that
threshold, you don't go back.
You're always going to incorporate
and always gonna use these technologies,
and it's going to essentially
fundamentally change the world.
AI is essentially the
culmination, I would argue,
of the entire digital revolution
that goes back to mainframe computers
in World War II actually,
it's really the start of
computing, mainframe computing.
AI is now the cherry on the top.
It's like the last thing
we really needed to do
was to harness all that technology,
harness all the digitization,
everything, harness the cloud,
harness all the things
we did over those years,
laying fiber optic cables,
and wireless networks, and everything,
to kind of come to the point
where now the computers
can actually think,
they can interact with us via voice,
and they can do things that
we could never do on our own.
So anyhow, that is a big deal.
I just wanna say, and I think if you,
once you kind of grok
that or really get it,
you realize,
oh my god, we could start applying
intelligence to everything.
And we are gonna start
this crazy sorting process
between humans and machines now.
That boring stuff or things
that are essentially humans are,
you know, really don't wanna do,
are gonna be done by machines.
And we're gonna take
it and invent new jobs
that are gonna use that
capability to augment us
to kind of do new things that
we didn't think we could do,
and scientific breakthroughs
we never thought we'd see.
Anyhow, there's a bunch
of sorting going on here,
I don't wanna go into those details,
but the point is, it's a huge
deal that we're crossing here.
And I think because of that,
we have to be thinking
extremely expansively
of what's possible now.
And one of the things
I think that's gonna,
we're gonna talk about
in a recurring fashion
is this idea of abundance.
One thing you can say about AI
is it is a technology with the potential
to create incredible abundance.
And I can explain why in many respects,
but let's just, I'll give you one example.
Every knowledge worker
and basically every person
is essentially gonna
have a digital assistant,
essentially like an executive
assistant who's virtual,
essentially AI.
Now, you could say, well rich
people or wealthy people,
or you know, CEOs have always
had executive assistants.
In fact, I've had three startups myself,
the first person I hire
as an executive assistant
to kind of solve all the
stuff I don't want to do,
and scheduling, and all this
stuff you have to solve.
But you give it to everybody and you say,
oh my god, we're all gonna do this,
it'll cost you 20 bucks a
month or something like that.
But here's the thing that's
interesting about that.
It's like that's allowing average people,
everybody to get the same thing
that the people at the top,
the kind of elite scarce
kind of commodity,
essentially used to be a
human executive assistant.
You had to come up with, you know,
about 150 grand or 100 grand essentially
to get someone to do that every year,
as opposed to 20 bucks a month.
So it's essentially
creating an abundant system
of executive assistants.
Same thing with tutoring.
You know, those same executive assistants
are gonna be essentially
tutors for everybody.
Everybody, every kid.
Now you say, well you
know, human, you know,
rich people have always had, you know,
tutors for their kids, you know?
You need extra help on
SAT scores or whatever,
you get a tutor.
What you're paying them through the nose,
but you know, if you have
money, you have money.
If you get a digital tutor,
for every kid starting from scratch,
even it costs 20 bucks a month,
essentially you've opened
up tutoring to everybody.
I mean, there are so many positive things
about AI potentially happening.
Let me just give one of them
that's already happening
is simultaneous language translation.
American English has become essentially
the lingua franca of the 20th
century in the modern world.
But still you needed
a business class college-educated strata
from all these different societies
to actually learn the language
and be able to talk that
language of kind of English
that connect around the
kind global economy.
But that leaves off a
unbelievable amount of people
who can't learn English,
or don't learn English,
or aren't educated, or
can't go to college,
or whatever it is.
Until now.
'Cause now, as you've seen,
everybody, you know, the AI's
talking to you in English
if you're speaking English,
but it's talking, you know,
Chinese to the Chinese,
it's talking, you know,
Hindi to the Indians.
I mean, it's basically doing it all,
and it's doing it about
90, 95% accuracy now.
We'll be able to have earbuds,
you go traveling with earbuds,
you're just gonna have an earbud on,
and whatever that person
and street vendor says,
you're gonna understand it.
You're gonna be asked to talk
to them about their family,
you're gonna go home with
them, see their kids.
I mean, that's the level of
integration in the world here.
So instead of a power of Babel,
we're gonna have this cross connection
of all those cultures, all
those kind of societies,
and it's just gonna be a wild time.
Now, it's also gonna throw a
lot of unintended consequences
and who knows what.
Yeah, I know for a lot of people,
particularly Americans are scared of AI.
In fact, weirdly, Americans
are more scared of AI
than other countries.
Like Chinese, for example,
have huge majority,
like 60% or more are
very positive about AI.
In the United States,
the positive people of AI
are something like 35%.
It's about a third of Americans
think it's a good thing.
Third of Americans think
it's a horrible thing,
and about a third in the middle
just don't really know yet.
But the point being is
there is a lot of fear,
and there's a lot, and partly I think
it's around a misunderstanding
of what's going on.
The second thing at why is this happening
is the media, I think, is very reactive.
It's very fear mongering, it's, you know,
freaking people out by these distortions
of these risks and things
that are essentially are solvable
but essentially make 'em unsolvable.
So there's a lot of fear and worry
about what's going on here.
But I think one of the
things that needs to happen,
and I'm trying to do,
but there's a lot of people
increasingly are gonna do,
is show the unbelievable
positive potential
of this stuff.
And I will say, every introduction
of every world changing
general purpose technology.
And fire, you know, electricity,
all of them come with risk.
I mean, when we first invented
electricity, you know,
wow, it lit up a house,
it lit up the street,
and you know, it's like,
wow, power's this thing called a radio.
It's like, this is awesome,
but if you touch the wire, you're dead.
And so there were people like,
oh, can't do electricity,
that's gonna screw us up.
And so there's always been these risks,
but we always kind of figure out
how to innovate to contain the risk,
and then institutionalize it to the point
where like every room on the
planet now has electricity,
and we don't even think about it.
It's not even thought of as dangerous
because we have codes,
and we have all kinds of ways we do this.
Let me just create another parallel here,
which is when we, why do we
call it the enlightenment?
When you go back in the past
there, that enlightenment,
the enlightenment is essentially
was an opening up of the lens
of what we understood about the world.
Because we had array of new tools,
everything from
microscopes, to telescopes,
and all kinds of things
that opened up the world.
So we said, oh my god,
we actually, you know,
are kind of, this is how blood cells work,
or this is, I mean there
was all that kind of level
of fundamental expansion and enlightenment
of what do we understand about the world,
which kind of drove this crazy explosion
of innovation and enlightenment.
So here we are in our era,
and you got AI.
I mean, AI is going to not
just supercharge innovation,
it is going to dramatically expand
what we understand about the world.
It's already happening.
In fact, you can kind of
see these various examples
of how just in the last year essentially,
we applied AI to one of the most difficult
scientific problems
of how do we understand
the protein folding
where from a genetic code,
how does it get expressed in
three dimensional proteins?
Humans have been trying to
wrap their head around that
for 50 years and been completely stumped.
And we put our AI on the task
and essentially blew open,
it took every gene and
explained every dimension
of every protein that's possible.
There's like 250,000
of them just overnight.
I mean, so that's just
one scientific advance
that just has already happened
in this early crude form of AI
that essentially is just
a taste of things to come.
We are gonna understand our world in ways
that we absolutely were just,
we will be boggled by like,
holy shit, how did we not know that?
Or all the kind of things
that's gonna happen.
And so there is a sense of essentially
creating a new kind of enlightenment.
Maybe the new new,
our new enlightenment is
one way to think about it.
And I think AI's gonna
be one of the players.
But there'll be other examples of this.
But essentially we're
gonna watch an explosion
of amplification.
The amplification of our mental powers
with digital computers, and now AI,
are gonna be very similar
to the amplification
of our physical powers,
that mechanical engines initially by steam
essentially amplified our physical powers,
we're now amplifying our mental powers.
And that's gonna create
another one of these
enlightenment situations
where we're just gonna say,
holy shit, we had no idea
this is the world we're in.
So there's another world historic
breakthrough in technology
that we're in right now.
And I think I want to just drive home,
how world historic this is,
and is tipping point time.
And that's clean energy technology.
And I think what people underestimate,
they hear of clean energy technology,
and they hear of renewable energy,
and they hear of solar,
and they kind of understand electric cars,
and they kind of get the
gist of what that is,
but I don't think they understand
how revolutionary this is.
This is the first time
we have an energy source
that is a technology, 100% a technology,
not a commodity.
We don't have to dig it up as coal,
we don't have to tap into it as oil.
We don't have to get plutonium
and put it in a kind of thing
to kind of create nuclear energy.
Those are using commodities
that you have to keep shoveling in
for the whole life of
these kind of plants.
And that also has,
and we've seen it particularly
around carbon energy
has a lot of secondary consequences.
It basically kind of, it releases carbon,
and is changing the climate of the planet,
which is unambiguous now, it's happening.
But now we've got solar,
which is 100% a technology.
It doesn't need anything
else once you create it,
and it becomes, and you can create energy
for the lifetime of that solar panel,
which is at least 30 years,
sometimes up to 50 years.
Why is that important?
Because once it's a technology,
you can consistently drive down the cost.
And there's a kind of a rule
of thumb in manufacturing,
which if you double the number
of essentially anything, really,
but let's just take it
in terms of solar panels.
If you double the number
of producing solar panels,
you will come up with about
20% of a drop in cost,
because you'll understand through
that manufacturing process
and the level of scaling,
and the kind of incremental
kind of improvements,
you essentially can keep
driving the cost down.
And so what we've watched
is over the last 40 years,
basically since the '70s,
we've watched essentially this
initiative was dramatic drops
and it's just consistently going down.
Here's the point, it's not stopping.
It's gonna keep getting cheaper,
and cheaper, and cheaper.
It is already by far,
if you create right now
an electric power station
on solar compared to coal,
the solar is half as expensive,
half as expensive now,
which is why nobody in their
right mind in the United States
is building a coal plant,
or in the entire developed world, frankly,
is because it's cheaper now to do solar.
It's just surpassed getting
cheaper than natural gas.
Particularly, I mean in
certain parts of the country,
particularly California, Texas,
all kind of with a lot of sunshine.
And this is the point, it's not gonna,
it's gonna keep getting cheaper.
And the same thing, flipping around,
the same thing with electric cars.
People think, well electric cars
are still expensive and whatever.
You're not thinking this through,
because battery technology
is the same thing.
It's essentially a technology.
And we have watched in the last 30 years,
we've watched 100% of the
cost of batteries go down
in the last 30 years from the '90s.
It basically, it's 100% down,
and it's going cheaper,
and it's, that's in lithium batteries,
we're now getting whole nother
generations of batteries
like solid state batteries
that essentially will be a
next generation batteries.
Well and also a point
about this electric thing,
the reason we have these tariffs
on Chinese cars right now
is Chinese cars, electric cars,
you can get 'em,
kick ass cars for like 20,000 bucks now.
They're already cheaper than
internal combustion engine.
50% of new cars in China
are being sold right now
are fully electric.
In California, we got about
25% fully electric statewide.
And in San Francisco and places
like that, it's about 50%.
So there are parts of America
that are trying to play
the game that China is,
but the rest of America is laggard,
and now you got Trump and others
that are kind of
dismantling the whole thing.
That's just kind of nutty.
But the point is the market,
the forward motion of costs
coming down on clean energy
is just beginning.
And when that happens,
you're gonna have what?
Abundant clean energy.
And so we are in entering
the next 25 years,
we will be able to create energy
at scales we couldn't expect before
with no impact on the
environment, or very little,
certainly on carbon energy.
And we'll be able to do things
like desalinate ocean water,
which is extremely energy heavy.
And up until now,
the trade off of like doing
that with carbon energy
was not useful.
It was too big a trade off.
But if you had a lot of
cheap abundant energy,
it was kind of trade-offs
are are kind of different.
And with climate change
and others, you know,
maybe if we start
running out of, you know,
California's running out of water
from the rains coming off the Sierras,
maybe we actually just
shift to desalination
using this kind of new
clean energy technology.
So anyhow, there's a different way
of thinking about the next 25 years.
Abundant clean energy.
So there's our two big abundants there.
So the average person's earliest exposure
to what you would call bioengineering
essentially has come
through initially GMOs,
genetically modified foods.
And there was a big backlash to that
for a while in the United States,
and particularly in Europe honestly,
because we were, we could understand
how to deliberately engineer,
manipulate the genomes of crops
to get more nutrition in them,
or to make them more resistant to drought
and things like that.
But there was essentially a backlash,
an initial backlash by the
environmental movement,
which I would say, was misplaced.
And that essentially is
we're gonna be overridden
as the problems of climate change amount.
But essentially, people have
already seen a version of this
that we could do.
But I think what's gonna
happen very shortly
is the pressures of climate change
are gonna be such that it
is going to be imperative
that we rely on genetic
engineering for our crops.
It is going to need to withstand
way different kind of
changes in temperature.
We're gonna have to shift
all kinds of climate changes,
things that react to, it's
gonna have to be more robust,
it's gonna have to be,
maybe won't be able to
scale as much farmland,
and you're gonna have to have
things much more nutritious
or more packed with more vitamins,
or all kinds of things that you could do.
And we can do.
Let's go back to what I
mentioned in the enlightenment,
that there were six big meta inventions
that we're still living within today.
One of 'em was industrial production.
And many, many positive
things came out of that.
That essentially is the reason
we have the modern world we
have today in many respects
is dependent on industrial
production at scale.
But the problem with
industrial production,
just like the problem with clean energy,
you know, carbon energies
screw up the climate.
Industrial production
screws up the environment.
And you just take one example.
You know, plastics.
You know, plastics are
an industrial production.
It's basically rooted
in petrochemicals too,
but essentially the
creation of plastic bottles.
Well, you know, anyone
who's got even mildly open
to watching the news is talking.
We're just overrun by
plastic bottles, you know?
The rivers in the third
world are chock full of 'em,
the oceans are full of 'em.
We've got microplastics now breaking down,
and you know, kind of in all our food
and all kinds of, it's like
that is a fricking disaster.
Industrial production,
that's just plastics.
I mean, there's a million
other industrial productions
that essentially create
incredible toxic waste,
and all kinds of stuff over the planet.
So industrial production is
going to be generally superseded
by biological production.
And this is the kind of shift here.
So industrial production was essentially
based on engineering,
inert dead materials.
We dug up materials, we, you know,
various ways that we
essentially manipulated,
designed and engineered products.
Biological engineering is essentially
engineering living things.
We essentially grow materials,
we grow new products.
We essentially have a bottle
instead of a plastic bottle,
you design and you
essentially create a bottle
that is biologic,
which is based on living processes
of biodegradable materials.
So you create a material
that can hold your
Pepsi cola or something,
for the, you know, sitting in the store.
But if that thing gets
thrown in the ocean,
and it's exposed to salt water,
it essentially dissolved within two weeks.
Or if it's exposed, thrown
out of a window of a car,
you know, going through the desert,
and it's exposed to UV light
for two weeks straight,
it'll essentially start to decompose.
I mean, this is the way nature works.
This is where, you know,
this is how the planet works.
And we are on the verge now
of understanding those
processes deeply to the point
where we can, humans can
engineer these processes
and at scale.
Second thing is a good example
that people have already
heard a little bit maybe about
is what they call cultured meat.
Because our understanding of biology,
and because of essentially
synthetic biology
of how do we artificially
do things that nature does,
we now know how to take a
cell out of a cow, or a pig,
or a fish, or whatever
living animal we want to eat.
You can take that cell and
you can put it in a vat,
and you can give it the same amount,
the same amino acids and
the same kind of nutrients,
and the same things that a
cow roaming around a field
for like years chewing on
grass for, you know, ever,
would get those same nutrients,
those same amino acids,
and essentially would produce
in their muscles, the meat.
That same thing can happen
in a vat with just energy,
and those same materials
at a much more efficient,
dramatically more efficient,
like 70% more efficient way
of doing this to actually grow
these same cow cell into actual meat.
Not like kind of meat,
not like plant-based meat
that's kind of like meat.
It's meat, it's the same cell,
it tastes exactly the same.
And we are, it's actually,
the breakthroughs have already happened.
It's still quite expensive
like many technologies,
but it's happening particularly
around chicken now.
You can actually get, even
in the United States now,
there's actually a few
places you can start to get
these kind of cultured meat.
Now one of the reasons
that this is important
is this also has a big climate component,
because cows are horrible,
beef is really bad for the environment.
They kind of release an
incredible amount of methane.
It's an incredibly inefficient way
to create meat, to scale meat up.
It takes a lot of time, it, you know,
ruins a lot of environment.
I mean, anyway, there's people
that you can kind of get in the
weeds on that kind of thing.
But the point being is as
we see climate change mount,
and as we see, by the way,
the wealth of the global population build,
people are gonna want to eat meat.
And so I am the projections,
I've seen that by 2040,
you could see a good section,
maybe 30% of the world's
meat will be cultured meat.
And it doesn't mean you're
gonna get a, you know,
there'll still be a way to get,
the elite to get an nice
slice of beef or from a cow,
a real cow.
But essentially, it'll be
all McDonald's hamburgers
will be that.
Any of the kind of just day-to-day meat
that goes into spaghetti
sauce or something
is gonna be cultured meat.
It'll taste the same.
So this is a huge breakthrough.
Again, this is based on the technology.
You gotta get grounded in technology.
And what's happened,
we've only 25 years ago,
it's like 2003 was the first time
humans had ever cracked or understood
the human genome.
Took $3 billion, and it
took 15 years to do it.
But it happened by, I think it was 2003
when it finally happened.
The cost of doing that from 3 billion
have now, by 2020, had
been driven down so far,
it was 1,00 bucks.
It is now at about, this is 2020,
it's now at the point
where it's about 100 bucks.
And eventually it's
gonna keep driving down
to 50 bucks or nothing.
That drop in price from 3
billion, to 1,000 bucks,
to 100 bucks, to, you
know, to today essentially,
is twice as fast as the cost reductions
that came from Moore's Law
in terms of the drops of
the price of computer chips,
which drove the digital revolution,
I just, we went through, The Long Boom.
And that is essentially
what's happening now.
It's dramatically faster.
There's a bunch of reasons for that,
but just know it's not
just the same level,
it is twice as fast.
Here's the other thing that's going on.
Basically right around the
time that we essentially
had our earliest breakthroughs
on this most recent AI,
essentially generative AI,
which is about 15 years ago,
we also had the big breakthrough
in what they call CRISPR,
which is essentially genetic engineering,
which is we figured out a
way to cheaply and easily
edit the genome of any living thing.
And here we are, that now
it's being used all the time
to kind of edit and change the genomes
of plants, of animals.
And if we wanted to, it could be humans.
So there is essentially, we're
on the cusp of a situation
where we can now design living things.
Now, there's a lot of
moral issues around that.
Gotta freaks people out.
And there's a lot of people
are gonna have a hard time with this.
But we have the ability to do that now.
We have the tools, we have the knowledge,
we understand how to do this.
This is where the word,
synthetic biology comes did.
Synthetic meaning humans create a fake,
essentially a human-driven biology.
We are now, because we know
the how the genes work,
we understand not just that,
but we understand proteins,
we understand all kinds
of things about the cell
we didn't know just decades back.
We can now essentially design
these things for outcomes
that we want to happen to,
let's say, make a tree
that is super strong,
and could replace steel
in certain buildings.
Or to kind of, you know, a
super fire resistant essentially
so that, you know, we
don't have to worry about
wildfires around cities or something.
You can engineer viruses or bacteria
to kind of create new
kinds of synthetic fuels
to kind of power planes.
I mean, that would not be carbon,
and wouldn't actually have
the same kind of release of
carbon into the atmosphere.
Anyhow, there's a bunch of new frontiers
in what they call synthetic biology,
or just I call in general bioengineering
that essentially are now
opening up in this century here.
In the next 25 years,
we're gonna watch a plethora
of these things expand.
Now here's the one thing about it,
it's a little bit slower
than these other two.
AI is here and going fast,
clean energy has already
had a great decade
of starting to scale, and
it's just unstoppable now.
And this one is a little bit later,
but I think in the space of 25 years,
it's worth really
wrapping your head around,
what could we do with that?
How could we reinvent healthcare?
How could we do all kinds of things,
that would be, again,
a more abundant future.
If you knew everyone's genome,
and you had AI that can monitor
every individual all time,
you could potentially dramatically
drop the cost of healthcare.
And so everybody in real
time essentially be monitored
and have a daily doctor check
in a way that as opposed to
once a year, you can do that,
and when you do, it's
cost you an arm and a leg.
So we are on the verge
of these technologies
could bring a society and
an economy of abundance,
and it's just really underappreciated
by the general people out there.
- [Interviewer] All right,
so final question on the topic here,
and this, really, I
think you could think of
as your kind of conclusion
statement, which is, you know,
what are people from the future gonna say,
looking back at this era?
- So the technology story of today, 2025,
that I laid out to you about AI,
clean energies, even bioengineering,
is kind of familiar at some level.
You can kind of get that,
whether you fully understand
the forward motion or not,
it's understandable.
The next several iterations here though,
I think is a putting a bigger lens
on what's going on today.
And it gets us back to
what we were describing
as what's happening in America,
is a once in an 80 year reinvention.
And in fact it's even possible
that what's going on here is essentially
the early days of building
a 21st century civilization.
And so when you think about that,
you go beyond the technology,
that's like the foundation,
that's the groundwork, that's like,
okay, that's the tools
we have to work with.
And so the next thing up, I
think, from the technologies,
you start thinking,
okay, well what could you
build with those technologies?
What kind of an economy
would you wanna build?
And again, it's not obvious or inevitable
that these technologies end up
with any particular economy.
The economy is built by
human beings coming together,
and fashioning essentially a system
that works for the
largest number of people,
if that's your kind of values,
or works for kind of driving
more kind of progress.
Anyhow, that's a value-laden
kind of system building exercise.
And I think what's going
on now in the world,
if you look around us
is we're in one of those reinventions now.
And let's just keep the,
kind of keep the lens on
America for right now.
The system, the economic system
that the United States has been based on,
neoliberal, or however you wanna frame it,
that has worked for essentially
the top 10% for sure,
and certainly for the top 1%,
has not been working for 80%,
or you know, of the Americans.
And it's gotten to the point
where they just have had it.
And the thing is, this isn't just America,
it's happening in the west.
You got right wing kind of movements
in every one of the major countries.
There is at least at 40%,
and push it towards
the majority sometimes.
And so something has to change.
I think we have to reinvent,
I mean, I guess you could call something
like sustainable capitalism,
sustainable not just in the externalities
of climate change and pollution,
which I've talked about how
our technologies can do that.
But essentially the externalities,
a sustainable system of work,
the average people feel
invested in the system
that's working for them,
that they're not gonna
scream bloody murder,
and kind of revolt at, you know,
at the first sign of kind of agony.
And that there's a system that works well
for everybody over the long haul.
And so as crazy as it sounds,
we could be at a point in
the world right now in 2025
where we are watching
the beginnings of a shift
from financial capitalism
born and raised out of the enlightenment,
more than 250, 300 years ago,
to essentially some version
of a sustainable capitalism
that I kind of did the
rough outline there.
We're going from a world of
representative democracy,
which was a brilliant move forward
from a civilizational perspective,
from a human being section 250 years ago,
to essentially a different kind
of what I would term probably something
called digital democracy, or
something along those lines,
which I can explain later.
What I would say we're facing now
is that system is so out of whack,
is so un-up to the scale
of kind of the challenges
that our country faces
at this time.
That it is actually gonna
increasingly dawn on people,
that essentially are gonna
have to invent or reinvent
at an even more fundamental level
than most people are thinking.
And I put it this way, if the
founders were coming today,
sitting in 2025,
and they basically were looking around
at the tools they had at
that time, including AI,
do you think they would've
come up with a system
what they did 250 years ago,
where they didn't understand
even what electricity was?
I mean, you know, Ben Franklin's out there
with a kind of kite trying to figure out,
is lightning, you know, what is it?
It's electricity.
They had no idea what electricity was,
let alone electronics, let
alone computers, let alone AI,
let alone kind of an
interconnected planet of internet.
I mean, essentially you'd be
insane not to take advantage
of those tools if you are really
trying to build a democracy
that kind of taps into
the world of the majority
and protects the minority,
keeps the pluralistic society,
and makes sure a tyrant
can't take control of it.
That's the same agenda, that's
the same building blocks.
Okay, how do we do that now?
I think that's actually gonna be something
that people are gonna
increasingly have to think about.
And I think what's
happening now with Trump,
and what's happening in
the country right now
is we're getting a constitutional crisis.
Oh, those guys didn't really think through
what happens if a President
won't kind of listen to the,
you know, courts or what happened.
You know, the courts
don't have any leverage
to kind of push back.
What happens if you get
a kind of a Congress
captured by these
interests that, you know,
don't seem to be listening
to what average people need.
Anyhow, there's much ways
you can talk about it,
and I don't want to get
into partisan politics,
but the point is, our
system is so gummed up now
that essentially it's
going to increasingly show
that we need some kind of invention.
And so when I say digital democracy,
this isn't some '90s version
of digital democracy.
I'm just saying, there
will probably be some way
to figure this out and tap
into the world of the majority,
and execute efficiently and effectively
for governance going forward
that'll be rooted in some
kind of digital technologies.
Because it is just such
a game changing thing,
and which means essentially AI
is gonna be involved in this.
Now, there's dangers
and issues and limits,
and we're gonna figure that
out. It's a long conversation,
but I'm saying we're at that stage.
The same thing I would
just say about governance,
global governance.
Again, if you would've talked
about this 50 years ago,
people would think of,
oh, you know, United Nations
is gonna run the world.
No, this is a different
way to think about it.
But here's the problem
is you are in a planet
of 10 billion people,
which by the way, is dramatically
more numbers of people
that we had at post World War II.
Second, dramatically more
people, we're in climate change.
There is incredible pressures.
We're gonna see mass
migrations almost inevitably.
You might see sea levels rising.
Stuff is going to happen this century
that is going to really
require coordination
at a global place.
You can't just crapshoot with,
oh, maybe 200 different nations
will come somewhat aligned,
and maybe we can strong
arm here and there.
I think that's just not gonna happen.
And so I think what
you're gonna see coming
is some kind of break.
It's not gonna mean we're all
gonna turn over government
to five people at the top of the planet,
but it means some kind of
sophisticated coordination
between all these entities,
maybe between cities,
between different layers of government,
between different peoples,
between different population centers,
whatever it's gonna be.
I don't know the beginnings of
exactly how that would work,
but if I had to guess,
it's gonna be leveraging
these new technologies,
particularly AI,
and that it'll be something
that'll be better than
the system we have now,
which by the way, our international system
that basically created the climate accords
is a complete fail.
You know, it's at the point now
where Trump has pulled out a second time,
and you know, we're kind of at this place
where we're back to square one
of coordinating all these
crazy ass nation states.
So I'm just saying,
that's the level of change
I think we're actually heading into.
That's the level of change
I think your kids are
gonna be wrestling with.
And that's the level of change
I think America is going through now.
And the quicker we start to wrap our heads
around that challenge,
and the kind of scale of
the invention we're up to,
the better off we're all gonna be.
(calming music)
- [Interviewer] All right, fantastic.
That is the end.
Landed the plane.
A very big plane.
- It is a big plane.
- [Interviewer] In turbulent conditions,
not an easy plane to fly and land off, so.
- Yeah.
- [Interviewer] Really appreciate that.
