Today I'm interviewing Arthur Kroeber,
the founder of Gavekal Dragonomics,
a research consultancy focused on
China, and the author of China’s
Economy: What Everyone Needs to Know.
A friend, while I was in
China, recommended it to me.
And it’s been the most valuable
and useful resource you can
get today on how China works.
Arthur, thanks for coming on the podcast
and taking the time to chat with me.
It's great to be here, thanks.
First question:
what really is the problem if China
becomes as wealthy as America,
or if its economy grows as big,
or even bigger than America’s?
I know it may not be your perspective
to be a China hawk, but I’ve
never really understood why this
is a problem in the first place.
It's a very good question.
There’s a lot of criticism of China
from the standpoint of, you're
trying to get rich, that's fine.
But you're basically trying to get rich
on the backs of everyone else in the world
by running this gigantic manufacturing
export machine, where it seems like
the Chinese ambition is to produce all
the manufactured goods in the world for
everyone, run an enormous trade surplus,
which means they are depending on other
people's buying power to support them.
And that this
is basically not fair, not
sustainable, not a stable way to
participate in the global economy.
That's more of a question not of, if China
does get rich, but how does it get rich?
Does it get rich by operating on the
same rules as everyone else and having a
market other people can participate in?
Or does it get rich by making it
impossible for anyone else in the world to
have the kind of production structure that
they want to have, and relying entirely
on these ever-growing trade surpluses?
In principle, from a welfare standpoint,
it would be great if China got to be as
rich as everywhere else in the world.
Even as rich as America.
But that is likely to have difficult
and destabilizing political
consequences, because of the vast
differences between the Chinese
political system and that of the US
and all the other major
industrialized countries.
On the trade surplus point, to the extent
that it is made possible by the government
involvement in industry… It’s actually
not even clear to me that that's the case.
If you have high savings and not
enough investment domestically,
the accounting identities are such
that you will have a trade surplus.
But suppose that's even the case.
On paper, it just seems like what
is happening is that the Chinese
taxpayer, the Chinese saver, is
subsidizing foreign importers.
On paper, it just seems like
we're getting a good deal.
I'm sure some people are upset
about this, specifically people
who manufacture outside of China.
But it's certainly not
something obviously insidious.
So it seems like if it wasn't for
this, there'd be some other reason
that China can't grow as wealthy as us.
I am playing a little bit
of a devil's advocate here.
But I don't really understand why this
is such a big issue that there needs to
be very powerful competition about it.
There are a couple of things beneath that.
One is the systemic political
difference is really important.
The US self identity is that it is the
leader of democracies around the world.
We are very invested, at least
for now, in our democratic system.
We'll see how that evolves over
the next two or three years.
There's some question marks around
that, but historically that's been a
really huge part of the US identity.
Basically the morality play of World
War II and the Cold War—which have
really been the crucible in which US
foreign policy has been formed—is that
you had an alliance of democracies
that fought back first against
fascism, then against communism.
They won.
The result was that you created
a world where most major
countries were democratic.
They operated on market economic systems.
We were heading towards a world of
convergence of systems where everyone's
essentially playing by the same rules.
China really gets in the way of that
narrative because it's this incredibly
successful authoritarian system where the
authority still calls itself communist.
US elites have never, to this day, really
gotten comfortable with the idea that the
Chinese political system is legitimate.
As long as you have that underlying
problem, it's going to be very
difficult to erase these difficulties.
On the economic side, I think it
is a problem, the way that China
has chosen to organize its economy.
In a strictly financial sense, the
rest of the world comes out ahead in
the sense that China is willing to
subsidize a lot of low cost production.
The rest of the world gets a lot
of cheap goods and the overall
welfare of the world improves a lot.
I think that's clearly true.
But if you look at what has happened to
the US politically over the last 20 years,
there are a lot of flies in that ointment.
The fly is that it is important
for large countries to be able to
maintain a diversified production
structure and maintain social cohesion.
If you lose the capacity to run a
manufacturing economy that employs large
numbers of people, there's a lot of
disruptions that come as a result of that.
The purely financialized economy that
we had growing up in the United States
in the early 2000s as a result of
this bargain with China wound up being
pretty bad for the social compact.
So there is a legitimate question
about how you integrate China's
growing power, wealth, industrial
might, into the world in a way that
societies around the world can tolerate.
It's a legitimately difficult problem.
I think a lot of the problems
have to do not with China
but with US domestic policy.
A lot of what's going on right now
is scapegoating of China as a way of
diverting attention from decisions
that need to be made domestically
about income redistribution and
macroeconomic policy and so forth.
But there is also a legitimate question
to be made about how China now accounts
for 20% of the global economy, probably
larger in the future, and a third
of the global manufacturing economy.
There has to be an agreed set of
rules about how it interacts with the
rest of the world so that everyone
feels that they are benefiting,
not just in financial terms.
We don't really have that agreement now.
Two points.
On the political system, I wonder if
we've learned a bad example from World
War II and the Cold War, which is
that great power conflict culminates
in the other party totally collapsing.
I think that was actually
necessary, obviously, for Hitler
and even for the Soviet Union.
I think they were evil regimes.
I think China today is an evil regime
in a way, but it's just not in the
same order as Stalin or Hitler.
So the end state for any great
power competition for America…
History is long, there will be more
than just these next few decades.
It cannot be that if there's a different
political system that it has to
collapse the way that the Soviet Union
collapsed or that Hitler collapsed.
The first thing to note here is that
this could be true of any country.
I think people conflate
these two arguments.
Whereas it's worth noticing that if
Australia was producing everything
the world consumed and had an economy
the size of America's, these arguments
should apply to them as well.
I don't think people have the sense
of if Australia were producing a
bunch of stuff for us, we would need
to form a coalition against them
and have this adversarial attitude.
But suppose we did.
There's a question of, "How could
you prevent this dislocation
and is it Australia's fault?"
The analogy is breaking down.
Let me just go back to China.
So there's low value-added
manufacturing where labor cost
is a big fraction of cost.
That kind of stuff was
shipped off to China.
But if it wasn't for China, there's
many other countries in the world that
have much lower labor costs than the US.
If it wasn't for China, it'd be like
Vietnam or Bangladesh or something.
Then there's high tech manufacturing.
There I haven't crunched the numbers, but
if I were to guess, I don't think with
TSMC's leading-edge 5 nanometer wafer, I
doubt very little of what it costs to make
that is the process engineers themselves.
That is just, "Can your
country produce it?"
There's a few different questions
in there, so let me break that down.
The first thing that you alluded to there.
Essentially, is a Cold War
the right framing for whatever
this conflict is with China?
My answer to that is absolutely not.
You can address that question
both empirically and conceptually.
Empirically, if you just
look at patterns of trade and
investment during the Cold War,
the Soviet Union never accounted for more
than about 1% of US trade and investment
flows were basically non-existent.
China at its peak about 10 years
ago accounted for 17% of US trade,
about the same amount as Japan
did in the late 80s and early 90s.
That number has come down a
little bit on the surface.
But when you take account of
stuff from China coming in through
third countries and so forth,
basically that remains the same.
If you talk about investment flows,
there's $600 billion or more of
US corporate investment in China.
That generates huge amounts of sales,
much larger than US exports to China.
The integration of the two
economies is just extraordinary.
There's basically no precedent for
it at any point in economic history.
It is just a completely different
order of magnitude to what was
going on during the Cold War.
So one question would be, "Okay, if you
really want a Cold War, does that mean
that what you want to do is you want
to reduce those trade and investment
flows back down to essentially zero?
If so, how do you do that?"
That's a very difficult problem.
You got at the more core conceptual
issue, which is, how does this end?
This does not end by China
going away or turning into
something completely different.
It's too big.
It is too successful.
The economic model is
successful on its own terms.
It has a lot of problems, but
it's fundamentally successful.
It is deeply integrated with the
entire global economy in ways that are
beneficial for China and beneficial for
most of the other countries in the world.
Everyone has some sort of a stake
in China continuing to succeed.
This is just not going to go away.
There’s another sense in which
it's not going to go away.
Let's say you could wave a magic wand
and make the CCP disappear tomorrow
and replace it with something else.
What would that something else look like?
If that something else were to
be successful at governing China,
it would almost certainly share
many of the characteristics of
the Chinese Communist Party.
It would have a strong determination for
China to be an independent geopolitical
actor, taking care of its own security
with a very strong military so that it
could defend itself against all of its
real and perceived security threats.
It would be committed—as every Chinese
government since the mid 19th century
has been—to maximizing the rate of
technological progress and making sure
that as much as possible of China's
core technology needs were met by
domestic production rather than imports.
It would be very, very
similar to what we have today.
It's a fantasy to think that we
have a problem here with just this
particular regime, that we can just
get them to change their minds.
No, the Chinese approach on this
is very deeply rooted in both the
institutional, cultural history of
China itself and its geographical and
geopolitical position in the world.
So it's going to have interests that
create a lot of friction and conflict
with the perceived interests of the
United States under any government.
It's probably going to be quite
successful at managing this
economy because they've been very
successful for many, many decades.
When I was in China, I asked somebody
I met what would happen if there
was an election in China tomorrow.
His answer was that it's possible
that the median voter in China is much
more reactionary than the government.
In fact, this might be much more
liberal than the regime you would
get out of a democratic election.
Yes.
We don't know for sure because there
really is a lot of public polling.
But a lot of people say that and my
perception is that could well be true.
All you have to do is look at the
Chinese Internet, the blogosphere.
They don't have Twitter but
they have local equivalents.
There is a lot of unfettered nationalist,
highly militaristic thinking there
that the government spends most
of its time keeping in check.
Every so often they unleash it because
they're in a spat with Japan or whoever
and they need to get up popular opinion.
Mostly they try to tamp that down.
A Chinese system that was fully
representative of actual popular
views… We don't know exactly what
that might be, but it could be
very, very difficult to deal with.
Going back to this discussion about
what should be the grand bargain
between the rest of the world and China.
I live in Silicon Valley and as you
know, a big topic of conversation is AI.
In particular the race between
China and the US on AI.
One idea I've heard is that what
we should do is give them free
rein on solar, electric vehicles,
batteries—all this other real world
heavy manufacturing that they seem to
have greater proclivity for anyways.
They consider it more real.
And, say, on AI and semiconductors,
we’ll dominate that.
Everything else we'll import.
Is this a plausible deal worth making?
Because if you take AI very seriously,
this might be an amazing bargain.
You
can say what you want in your ideal state
of things, but how do you get there?
There are a lot of people in China who'd
say, "No, we want it all and we can. So
why should we make that deal with you?"
If I basically take this down to the level
on which the United States and China are
now starting to negotiate, my personal
view on this is that it would make a lot
of sense for the US to be much more open
to direct investment by Chinese companies
in manufacturing in the United States.
I'm thinking particularly of things
like electric vehicles and that whole
supply chain, green energy, industrial
automation, all of those things.
Why do I think that?
First of all, if the US is serious about
revitalizing its industrial base—and I
think there's a good case for trying to
do that selectively—it is not going to
happen unless you invite in the world's
leading players and have them compete.
That is how China industrialized.
45 years ago, they were
an industrial basket case.
They said, "We want to
get industrially strong.
How do you do that?
Get all the leading companies in the world
to invest here and we'll learn from them."
That's how you do it.
If we're serious about that, we should
be serious about figuring out ways
that we can bring Chinese industrial
investment into the United States.
That to me would be a win-win,
because Chinese companies at an
individual level would love that.
They see the US is a huge market.
They can't get into it right now.
They would love the opportunity
to tap into it more.
We could learn from them.
And if you did that, basically you would
be saying that whatever we're in with
China, it's not a cold war, because
we are willing to have high levels
of direct investment by both sides.
You might want to put protections around
that, all kinds of rules of the road.
But in an ideal world, we
would have a lot more of that.
The first question is,
why is that so difficult?
Why do you essentially have a
consensus in Washington that not
only do we have to prevent the export
of US technology goods to China,
but we also have to prevent Chinese
companies from investing in the US?
This is basically agreed on in Washington.
And the reason is data.
Fundamentally, there is a view that
any manufacturing process today
is also a data creation machine.
Where does that data go and
who benefits from that data?
The other thing is that, back 30 or 40
years ago, you used to be able to divide
the world into technologies which were
essentially for civilian use, a few
technologies that were military, and
then a very small proportion of dual-use
technologies that could go either way.
It was those dual-use technologies that
had to be controlled very carefully.
Now basically everything is dual use.
Any technology that you can imagine can
be put to some kind of military use.
So it becomes much more risky to have
these patterns of investment, particularly
when you don't know where the data is
flowing and how that will feed into
someone else's defense production base.
That is a legitimate concern.
In my ideal world, you would have a lot
more Chinese investment in the United
States, but it would be very carefully
regulated in the same way that China very
carefully regulates the direct investments
by foreign companies in its economy.
They have rules about
data localization, etc.
I think that could be achieved.
I think it will be very difficult in
the current political environment.
In terms of the grand bargain
that you suggest, China is very
interested in not being pigeonholed.
They didn't want to be pigeonholed
in low value-added manufacturing.
They wanted to do the high tech
stuff, now they're doing that.
They don't want to be
pigeonholed in manufacturing.
They want all of technology, including AI.
I don't think that any strategy
premised on the idea that China
should accept arbitrary limits
on what it can do is viable.
Would we accept that?
Absolutely not.
So why should we expect them to accept
something that we would consider an
absurd and completely unreasonable
infringement on our sovereignty?
It just doesn't work that way.
It's funny because one of the main arguments
that China hawks will make, or one
of the big parts of the worldview,
is that China really cheated us.
Our companies would invest in China,
build up factories in China, and
technology would get transferred there.
This was a huge arbitrage
that China was able to pull.
So if you actually believe that,
it should just make the reverse
of that incredibly compelling.
Because you get a chance to do that again.
Do you want to tell the story of
BYD and Tesla in 2018 and 2019?
Because I think this really
illustrates the point of what
could be done in reverse very well.
If you go back to the early 1990s, China
recognized that pretty much every other
country that had gotten rich had done so
in large part by building up an automotive
industry that then served as the mechanism
for creating innovations in other sectors.
Look at the US, Germany, Japan,
even Korea which is very successful.
They said, "We have to
have a big auto industry.
This is one of the key industries
that we have to support."
So starting in the early 1990s,
they had this strategy of bringing
in foreign companies and making
them do joint ventures on a 50/50
basis with Chinese auto companies.
The theory was that eventually
the Chinese companies would learn.
You would be able to develop your
own national champion auto companies
and kick the foreigners out.
Basically this failed.
It failed massively.
Over the next 25 years, foreign
companies came in: General Motors,
VW, Toyota, Honda and so forth.
And they did very, very well.
The joint venture partners in China
basically just sat around and clipped
coupons from the dividends that
these joint ventures were producing.
All of the technological inputs
continuously came from the foreign
partners, all of the design ideas.
The local partners were
never able to succeed.
In volume terms, you had a lot of smaller
scale, locally sponsored vehicle companies
in China building low-end vehicles.
So a lot of the cars that wound up getting
made in China were made by local firms.
But if you look at the share of
profits and total value in the
system, it was dominated by these
joint ventures, which were in turn
dominated by the foreign partners.
So China, circa 2010-2015, had
been doing this for 25 years.
They were basically no closer to having
globally competitive conventional car
makers than they had been 25 years before.
So in the late 2000s, 2005-2010,
they started thinking, "Well,
this and other related industrial
policies are not working very well.
We are not generating the national
champions that we thought would be.
So what do we do about this?"
Their answer was to leapfrog: "Let's
try and figure out what is the next
stage of technological development that
people really aren't working on yet.
Let's work on that and then maybe
we can get in on the ground floor."
What they came up with in large
measure was renewable energy and
specifically electric vehicles.
They started having a pretty comprehensive
set of subsidies and other kinds of
industrial support for companies like
BYD to produce electric vehicles.
BYD is basically a private company.
This worked okay for 10 or 12 years.
BYD got pretty good.
Particularly what they started to
figure out was the supply chain.
They got very good at
making the batteries.
But still by 2018-2019, BYD was
still not that exciting a company.
Most people in China really didn't
want to buy electric vehicles.
They seemed really inconvenient.
The sexy cars were the big
SUVs that the joint ventures
were putting out and so forth.
Then in 2018, the Chinese
government made the decision to
allow Tesla to come in and build a
wholly-owned Gigafactory in Shanghai.
They had never approved a wholly-owned
automotive company before.
They started cranking out cars in
2019, which became immensely popular.
It seems like one of the things that
happened was that the Chinese companies
by 2019 had gotten pretty good at the
underlying technology of electric cars,
specifically the batteries and the
software systems that govern the cars.
But they were terrible at consumer design.
They had not figured out how
to make appealing products
that people would want to buy.
Tesla did have appealing products
that people wanted to buy.
They were big status symbols.
So BYD and its competitors said, "Okay,
this is the part we have to figure out.
How do we achieve this?"
Basically, they recognized that
they had to up their design game.
Among other things, they went to
Germany and loaded up on a lot of
German car designers that were able
to transform their technology base
into much more appealing packages.
Then by 2022 or so, they were
able to compete with Tesla
both on price and on quality.
What that shows you is that, number one,
the Chinese government made a pretty
good bet on this leapfrogging idea:
"There are technologies in the future.
We need to get in early,
subsidize the heck out of them."
Some of the estimates that have been
made about the level of subsidies
given to the EV industry and its supply
chains range from $200-300 billion.
It was a huge, huge amount of money
that did not generate that much
of a financial return for a really
long time but they stuck at it.
Then the thing that finally flipped
the switch was this catalytic foreign
investment that showed the Chinese
companies what they needed to do to
actually compete in the consumer market.
Then they got very good
at that very quickly.
How much was the $200-300 billion actually
relevant given the fact that BYD, as
you mentioned, is a private company?
How much of that was actually
necessary or counterfactually
important to creating this outcome?
It's like the old slogan about
advertising: half of it works,
but you don't know which half.
Did China need to spend
that much in subsidies?
Probably not.
But had they spent less, would
they have had the same effect?
Maybe, maybe not.
They tried various different
types of subsidies.
Initially there were producer subsidies
to just get companies to produce more.
Then they had a lot of buyer
subsidies at the individual level,
but also the city government level to
promote things like electric buses.
I think all of that played a role.
What was important was that
the government set a very clear
direction and they said, "We want
this to happen, we really want it.
We don't know how long it's going to take.
We're just going to keep trying
different things until it works.
Because the goal of creating this electric
vehicle sector and the whole supply chain
for it, that's what we want at the end."
Why are they able to identify
these kinds of sectors in advance?
Central planning isn't supposed to work.
There's been many cases of countries
which have tried to do this.
Germany, Japan, and many other countries
missed out on the Internet because
there was a centrally directed effort
towards these heavy industries or
manufacturing, which actually turned out
not to be relevant in the 21st century.
No, it's definitely perilous.
China has a list of key industries.
It's called the strategic
emerging industries.
They came up with it basically in 2010.
It built on previous iterations
of industrial policy.
Most of it is not really an effort
to predict with a high degree
of specificity what comes next.
They're mostly pretty obvious things like
semiconductors, industrial
automation, new materials.
It’s all this kind of stuff that
would be on anyone's list if you were
running a VC fund and saying, "What
are the sectors that we think are—"
But most VC funds are losing money.
Actually, maybe only a couple of
firms in the world were able to
make this prediction correctly.
So it's like a couple of firms in the
world plus the Ministry of Information
Technology in China are the only
people who can predict the future?
No, I think basically the analogy
with the VC fund is a pretty good one.
I’ve made it many, many times.
Think of China as a giant VC fund that is
just willing to lose huge amounts of money
for a really long time on the assumption
that a few of the bets will pan out.
China as a state, as a government,
is uniquely able to throw a lot of
money at things for a really long time
and not care about what returns are.
And say, "We're going to identify
this universe of potential winners.
We're going to promote
all of them, basically.
Some of them may work and some of
them may not, and the successes
will pay for the failures."
I guess I'm still confused on why…
Many other countries have
tried similar things.
MITI was a Japanese
version of this, right?
Look at their economy now
and their high tech sector.
There’s a couple of things.
First of all, even if you go back
to like 2005-2006, when we started
thinking about this, everyone was
saying that green energy was going to
be an important industry in the future.
You had the Kleiner Perkins guy.
John Doerr was the big VC who said circa
2007, "I'm going to put all of my bets on
green energy because this is the future."
He turned out to be wrong from the
standpoint of his investment returns.
But he turned out to be totally correct
in terms of this being a really big thing.
It was just not that wild a bet
to say that green energy was going
to be really important and that we
should place a lot of bets on that.
Why does this work and why is this
different from a central planning thing?
That's a really important point.
First of all, the Chinese system,
like the systems that preceded it
in East Asia—Japan, Korea, Taiwan,
and so forth—has always put a lot of
emphasis on being good at exporting.
There are a lot of pressures
within the system to create
industries that can export.
The reason this is important is if you
have a totally closed system—which frankly
is what I think Donald Trump is trying to
create in the United States—and people are
just producing essentially for domestic
consumption, there's no incentive to keep
up with global technology developments.
If you have this constant export focus,
essentially what everyone is trying to do…
If you have a closed domestic market,
you can rig the domestic market
and buy off your connections in the
government to make sure that you, as
a company, have your market share.
There are a lot of ways to win that do
not involve technological upgrading.
That is what dooms all
import substitution regimes.
If you're an export-driven economy,
you can't rig the global economy.
Ultimately you have to compete.
You can't compete just on price, you
have to compete on raising your game.
Japan did this successfully,
Taiwan did this successfully,
Korea did this successfully.
China's done that successfully.
So that's answer one.
You had this underlying system which
was heavily incentivized towards
technological upgrading across the board.
That's what you were sitting on top of.
It was completely different from the
old central planning regime, which
was autarkic and inward-looking.
Second, you had this domestic competition
environment which was really cutthroat and
involved a lot of international companies.
This is a little bit of a difference
from Japan, which always kept the foreign
companies out of its domestic market.
Their companies operated globally
very, very well, but the domestic
market was very protected.
China's domestic market
was not that protected.
They were always willing to bring in
companies that they thought would be
able to spark some technological change.
So what this did is it created a
field in which maybe the government
has the right ideas, or maybe they
don't, but you have a crucible in
which their ideas can be tested.
You have a very competitive domestic
market where you have a lot of
the big international players
doing their own thing as well.
So the things that work get
some validation and you can keep
building on those successes.
That's really important.
Then just the sheer scale at which
they were able and willing to support
what appeared to be losing bets
for a long time does matter.
You could contrast their view,
for example, in solar energy.
They said, "Look, we want
to be big in solar energy."
Again, they started
thinking about this in 2005.
"What do we need to do?"
So they identified the whole supply
chain, from the raw silicon inputs to all
of the modules in the finished panels.
They said, "We want to be
in every stage of that."
So they had a pretty deliberate
strategy of trying to create people
at every point in the supply chain.
And they were willing to go through
cycles of people not making any money.
The obvious comparison in the United
States is that the US government gives
one loan to one company, Solyndra.
It goes bad and everyone says
this is proof that industrial
policy does not work.
China actually has the right
answer to that question.
We had the wrong answer to that question.
You have to be willing to accept
some failures and some loss of
government money along the way
if you want to get to the end.
But I really stress the ecosystem
because a lot of this would not
have worked just by the government
saying, "Oh, we want to do solar."
It would not have worked unless you
had this broader ecosystem system
of export-driven manufacturing,
high competition, and international
participation across many,
many sectors of the economy.
They all converged to
create a successful result.
I want to put some of these
bureaucrats in a Factorio
speedrun and see how they do so.
I just interviewed Ken Rogoff,
so Japan's top of mind for me.
That's really interesting that
even though Japan had this export
discipline, maybe the reason that
the growth didn't continue after the
80s is because you had this convoy
system where banks were incentivized
to lend to people they knew
in these conglomerates.
These conglomerates have been around
for decades, even before World War II.
I have a question now about China.
You have these companies which have become
national champions and are conglomerates,
the same companies producing a phone
and a car and everything in between.
Given the
intrinsic nature of authoritarian
systems, or systems with
financial repression, will we
go to a system that is closer
to what Japan had in the 80s?
Where they’re going to give
money to Huawei, because Huawei
or BYD are the right people.
Or will it remain dynamic, especially
in the sectors which are coming
up over the next few decades?
It's a good question.
I would start by emphasizing
the ways in which China is
very, very different from Japan.
The central thing that is really
different and lies at the root of
a lot of this, is that China is
an independent geopolitical actor.
Japan was not.
Japan, at the end of the day,
could rely on the US for security.
They were demilitarized.
China basically is on its own.
They're in a very dangerous neighborhood.
They have 14 land neighbors
they share borders with.
They have names like North Korea,
Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan,
a lot of dangerous actors.
Several of them have nuclear weapons:
North Korea, Russia, Pakistan, and India.
So China, just in a very narrow sense,
lives in a very dangerous neighborhood.
They quite legitimately have some pretty
significant national security needs.
They also have aspirations
to be a great power, and they
want to do it on their own.
The incentive to get things
right is much more existential
in China than it was in Japan.
Japan essentially could take the choice
to sort of say, "Oh, we're going to have
a stagnant economy and that's bad and
whatever, but actually we'll be fine."
For China, it's not fine.
So underlying it, there's a spur that
increases the chances that the Chinese
leaders will do the things that they need
to do to keep the system more dynamic.
It's not a guarantee, but it's
a pretty strong incentive.
Then, if you look at some of the
specifics, the big difference between
the way that China and Japan are
economically organized is essentially
the relationship between the
financial and the corporate sector.
Japan had a system where banks owned
equity in these giant industrial companies
and trading companies, and vice versa.
There were these cross shareholdings,
which meant that essentially
the entire economy of Japan, the
entire corporate and financial
sector, had one big balance sheet.
All of that balance sheet rested,
by the late 1980s, on land values
that had just gotten completely
detached from any form of reality.
There was an investment thesis
among investors who were playing
the Japanese stock market in the
late 80s, that you did not look at
the earnings of Japanese companies.
Those were irrelevant.
What you looked at was the value
of the land they controlled.
You looked at essentially a capital
ratio where you assumed that
the value of their underlying land
capital was a permanent contribution
to their wealth and prosperity.
The valuations of these stocks,
which again got crazy, you
couldn't justify them by earnings.
They said, it doesn't matter because the
land they're sitting on is so valuable.
Then the land values collapsed by 80%.
The stock values had to collapse
by a similar amount, 80%.
Everyone was holding
shares of one another.
So the banks’ capital got eroded
because a lot of their capital was
tied up in the land and in the stocks
which were collateralized by land.
So they were unable to lend.
They just had to deleverage
as fast as possible.
The companies had to
deleverage as fast as possible.
The entire economy got engulfed by this
phenomenon of debt deflation, which
basically means in the act of paying down
the debt—because you're doing fire sales
of assets—you're reducing the prices of
those assets and introducing deflation.
So the real value of your debt
continues to grow even as you are
supposedly reducing it, because
of the deflationary effect.
It's very, very difficult to get out.
China does not have this problem at all.
They looked at the problems that Japan
got into, they looked at similar problems
that Korea had in the late 1990s, and
they said, "We will never allow this
kind of cross shareholding between
financial companies and corporations.
This is way too dangerous."
They have kept the two quarantined.
It is illegal for industrial
companies to own a bank.
The bigger ones are allowed to have
internal financing subsidiaries,
but they can only sort of manage
finance inflows within the group.
It is also illegal for banks to load
up on shares of industrial companies.
So you have a distinct financial
system and industrial system.
Which means that the particular type
of macro problem that Japan got into is
very, very unlikely to occur in China.
You do have huge debt problems.
The property developers are very
over leveraged, it’s a huge problem.
We've had a massive property crash
in China over the last five years.
That is a big, big problem.
You have local governments that
borrowed a lot of money, invested
in infrastructure which is now
delivering very little returns.
They have a big debt problem.
You have very substantial debt
problems in China that have significant
negative macro consequences.
But they're all isolated
and they can be dealt with
sort of one by one.
If you look at the industrial sector,
it's not very highly leveraged.
Debt levels in fact are not high.
Most private companies in China have
learned for many years that they
couldn't get access to bank credit.
The banks only wanted to lend to
state-owned enterprises which were
secure, had physical collateral,
and had a state guarantee.
Private companies for years have learned
to make do by basically financing their
investment out of retained earnings.
Their leverage ratios are not that high.
They're creeping up now over
the last few years because of
the big industrial policy push.
But fundamentally they're
in a very different position
from the Japanese companies.
This is just stuff from your
book that I'm citing back to you.
You talk about these local government
financing vehicles which are backed.
The local government takes
out a lot of loans in order
to build this infrastructure.
That is backed by the presumed
appreciation of the land, which should
go up as this infrastructure goes up.
That sounds actually very similar to the
problem you were describing with Japan.
You say, "Look, this is debt that's on
the local government's balance sheets.
But
fundamentally it's like one country."
You have this system where the government
can just hand the debt to somebody.
So how immune is the
private economy really?
Will it just take down the
local government and then
nobody will make a fuss?
These other companies will just
never have to hear about it again?
I guess my view on this is that
this local government land based
financing model was actually a
pretty smart thing to do initially.
For a decade or so it worked quite well.
Local governments were sitting
on a lot of these land assets.
The land assets originally were
undervalued quite substantially.
So it made sense for the local
governments essentially to try and
capitalize some of the future value
of these things and use them to
finance infrastructure development.
This was not a rogue policy that local
governments came up with on their own.
It was actually sponsored by the
central government and the China
Development Bank back in the early 2000s.
They were grappling with the problem that
China at that point had a severe shortage
of housing and infrastructure of all
kinds, including urban infrastructure.
The question was, "We need
a lot more of this stuff.
How do we build it?
How do we finance it?"
They realized, "Actually as we
build this stuff out, the values
of the land are going to skyrocket.
So let's essentially take some
financing against that future
land price appreciation and use
that to build the infrastructure
that makes everything possible."
If you look at the first two cases of
where this was done in the early 2000s,
they had these estimates of what the land
would ultimately be worth that seemed
ridiculous and astronomical at the time.
They were in fact way too low.
They were way, way conservative
on what the actual land
price appreciation would be.
So you had a period of about eight or
nine years where essentially the state-run
development banks were doing this in a
fairly controlled way, very successfully.
What happened was that after the 2008
financial crisis, the government said,
"Oh, we just have to spend a lot of
money to gin-up growth because there's
been this global economic catastrophe."
They did a massive cash infusion into the
banks and to the state-owned enterprises.
They said, "Spend, spend, spend,
and basically all infrastructure
is good infrastructure or
just build whatever you want."
What happened at that point was
that all of the commercial banks
got into this business of lending
money to local governments for
these infrastructure projects.
Their underwriting standards were
much less robust than the China
Development Bank’s had been.
For the local governments, it
was just free money to them.
They just took all the
money and they ran with it.
That created this kind of
Frankenstein's monster.
Even so, you had quite a lot of
that money in the first two years
that probably generated a pretty good
return because China was still underbuilt
relative to what it needed to be.
But after that had run for three or four
years, it became clear that a lot of
this was going into wasteful projects
that didn't deliver a good return.
Now they've been struggling for
the last decade to unwind that.
But it's important to understand
that the underlying model
was actually an okay model.
It just wound up being done
in a way that was completely
uncoordinated and excessive.
You didn't have incentive structures
that enabled local governments to
rein it in when they needed to.
So I still think that that is
fundamentally a local government
fiscal problem, which ultimately is
a central government fiscal problem.
If you look at the consolidated
balance sheet of the central and
local governments, put all together,
China's government debt is still
probably less as a share of GDP
than US federal government debt.
The US is over 100%, China
is probably under 100%.
So my previous guest, Victor
Shih, estimated that the
local government debt alone is
somewhere between 100-150% of GDP.
If you add it to the central government
debt, I think he estimated that
government debt in China is 200% of GDP.
I would respectfully
disagree with Victor on that.
It's impossible to know for sure.
You have the problem of formal debt,
which is debt issued by government
entities, and then you have contingent
debt, which is debt issued by corporations
that may or may not essentially be
fronts or windows for local governments.
There is also a very significant
problem of double counting,
which is hard to resolve.
Debt gets counted at different
levels in the system.
It's one piece of debt, but depending
on how long the chain is, it gets
counted in various different places.
I've long had the view that many of these
much larger estimates of debt don't fully
account for the double counting problem.
It's quite possible that the true debt
level is higher than what we think it is.
It's unlikely, in my opinion, to
be as high as Victor says it is.
It also matters what the debt goes
to and who is actually formally
responsible for paying it.
Are there project flows or income
flows that can be used to pay for it?
The structure of the
servicing of the debt matters.
At the end of the day, we do have a pretty
good sense from the macro data of how
much total debt there is in the economy.
It's on the order of 300% of GDP.
So if you want to say that government
debt is 200% of GDP, then unless
you're double counting, you're
basically saying that everything else
is a lot less than you think it is.
Do we know what the total debt,
private and public, is in the US?
I don't have it off the top of my head.
The federal government debt I think is
around 110% GDP, something like that.
Total gross debt of all sectors,
government, corporations,
households, I think would be on
the order of around 300% of GDP.
Japan is substantially higher.
You can get into an endless
debate on these things where it
becomes kind of a numbers game.
But I have a pretty high
conviction that China has a
significant macro leverage issue.
If you take my numbers, say gross
debt to GDP—which by the way are
the official numbers of the Chinese
government and largely accepted with
some structural modifications by
the IMF, so forth—it’s 300% of GDP.
That is in the ballpark for
highly developed economies.
It is extremely high for
middle-income economies.
So if you look at China as an economy
that has average per capita income
that's kind of like Brazil, China
is way more leveraged than any other
country of its level of income.
That is potentially a problem.
So I don't want to make light
of the problem because I
think it is quite serious.
It's an important constraint on
policy and it is an important
constraint on growth, at the moment.
I don't think that it leads to a
financial collapse situation because
the system is contained and all the
debt is denominated in local currencies.
But it does impose a tax on growth
and it is one of the things that
makes China's growth more sluggish
now than it probably could be.
Why is it the case that middle-income
countries are especially in a bad position
with having a high debt to GDP ratio?
You would think naively that they're in
a position to have higher growth over
coming years, so it may make sense for
them to take on more debt so they can
use that to finance the greater growth
that will come—theoretically assuming
they use it to invest in high return
things—as opposed to the US or Japan
where you're just going to be stuck
with this debt load for a long time.
One of the things that you could say
about debt historically in China was
that it tended in general to finance
productive assets, whether it was
industrial production or infrastructure.
For many years China was a
very infrastructure short
country relative to its needs.
So you could justify quite substantial
debt-financed infrastructure investments
on the basis of these would deliver
good economic returns for many decades.
The case for that is a lot
weaker now than it was before.
The problem is how you essentially
retire this enormous stock of very
low-productivity, infrastructure
investments, debt-financed.
How do you sort of move on and have a more
productive return on capital in future?
There are ways for solving that problem.
To me the fundamental issue is they
have too much of a supply-side strategy,
not enough of a demand-side strategy.
It's really a macroeconomic issue.
If they had stronger domestic demand, that
would generate more profits for companies.
They would be able to have more
pricing power for companies.
You would get a little bit of inflation.
So you would have more cash flows within
the economies that would enable people,
and local governments, to pay down debt.
A little bit of inflation would
erode the real value of the debt.
That's essentially how they got out of
their last debt problem in the late 1990s.
They had gigantic bad debts in the
banking system, essentially representing
legacy loans to state-owned enterprises.
They had no way of paying them back.
They had a very, very growth
friendly program that generated a
lot of growth, a lot of inflation.
That basically strengthened
their debt problem.
What they need now is a
kind of a revamped, updated
version of that strategy.
They do a lot more to promote
domestic demand, to get more profits,
more cash flows, and a little bit
more inflation into the system.
That would probably solve the debt
problem over, you know, a decade or two.
I want to keep asking you
more questions
about the nitty gritty of
the situation, but before
we keep deep diving I want to
step back and ask this question.
The valence of things you've said so far
has been, "Look, they've been remarkably
competent even at the things which
economists criticize them most for."
For the majority of the period
of these schemes they've
actually worked out quite well.
For example, this local government
financing through land sales on
estimated future income and so forth.
Obviously we've been talking about
the Chinese industry and how that's
been successful in many key sectors.
I guess a big picture question
I have is, if that's true…
They're still at like a fifth of American
national income per capita, a third
of similar countries in East Asia,
like Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea.
How do we explain the relative poverty
on a per capita basis in China?
How do we explain obviously
bad decisions like Zero-Covid?
I guess I'm having trouble
squaring the circle.
If they're making all these great
calls, why isn't China more successful?
They're not successful enough?
I thought one of the problems in
the world that we're facing today is
that they're too successful at too
many things and that this is creating
difficulties for other people.
Yeah, that has come up from time to time.
During the period in the 90s and 2000s,
they were growing at 10% a year, which
is the fastest growth rate recorded by
any economy in the history of mankind.
They were doing it not for one or
two years, but for 20 years in a row.
People often say there's all this waste
and there's too much debt on enterprises
and that they could grow much faster
if they were just more efficient.
It's like, "Really, could they?"
They're already growing faster
than anyone has grown before.
Is it really the case that they could
have grown a lot faster than they have?
Maybe, but I doubt it.
The reason is that there's what I
would call an efficiency fallacy.
Global macroeconomists
have all been basically
trained in the United States
since the end of World War II
and particularly since the 1990s.
They view the US in its
developed state as the norm
rather than as the result
of other processes.
It's like, "The way we operate
now is the way we got here."
Actually, that's not quite the case.
The reason China was able to grow so fast
for so long was that they were able to
mobilize these huge swaths of resources,
domestic savings, and throw them in an
uncoordinated way at a lot of problems.
There was a lot of waste along the way.
That was part of the equation.
So if they had tried to be maximally
efficient and said, "No, no, we're not
going to allow banks to lend unless
they can prove that this project is
definitely going to have an ROI of X."
They would have lent a lot less and
they would probably have had a lot less
growth because they were not willing
simply to create that wall of money
that would create broad-based growth.
They might in fact have had substantially
more inequality than they did.
Their wasteful method allowed them to
spread out investment in a lot of areas
which were geographically disadvantaged.
Those areas might not have done so well
in a purely efficiency driven system.
I think we need to be careful about
assuming that inefficiency is bad.
I think inefficiency sometimes can
be, as long as it is basically the
result of a desire to be effective,
a byproduct of a successful growth story.
That's basically my account of China.
Is it your quote in the book,
something like, "For a country of
China’s scale, what matters not is
efficiency of using the resources, but
effectiveness of achieving outcomes"?
Basically that's my thesis.
I think they've shown that
this works quite well.
That's also part of the answer to why
aren't they richer on a per capita basis.
Well, there are 1.4 billion people.
It is just gigantic.
Think about the scale problem.
Taiwan, South Korea, they got to
whatever they are relative to US per
capita GDP—60-70%, something like
that—within a generation or two.
Taiwan had 20 million people.
South Korea had 40-45 million people.
To move that number of people and
get them all working in high wage
industrial or service jobs in
urban areas, you can do that in the
course of a generation, 20-25 years.
I think it's just physically impossible
to achieve that on the scale that China's
been operating on with 1.4 billion people.
You look at the urban
migration that they've done.
It is completely unprecedented in
the history of humanity, the speed at
which they have converted people from
rural residents into urban residents.
For many years they were urbanizing
at the rate of 20 million people a
year added to the urban population.
I forget the precise calculation
that I made, but in terms of
housing and urban infrastructure,
they were building the equivalent of
New York plus Philadelphia plus San
Francisco every single year for 20 years.
No one has ever done
anything like this before.
The lesson of this is that there's
an arithmetic problem there.
Even if you do this on this unprecedented
scale, and do it faster and bigger than
anyone has done it before, if you're
trying to move 1.4 billion people into
an income of United States-level, it
just takes a really, really long time.
Now of course, what's
happened is that they have
gone too far off the deep end of
industrial policy and thinking the supply
side will solve all of their problems.
Growth has slowed down quite
a bit in the last few years.
It's probably well below potential.
I don't think that there's a lot of
evidence that China's growth was below
potential from 2000 until 2020 on average.
I think there's a lot of evidence
that it is below potential now.
They are sacrificing the ability of the
average Chinese person to do more rapid
catch-up with the living standards of
the West, in order to achieve these
industrial policy technology goals.
I have a question just to react
fast to some of the things you
said.
Obviously there's places in China now
like Shanghai or Guangdong, which have
per capita incomes approaching these East
Asian neighbors that are really rich.
To the extent that that's possible through
this high tech manufacturing—and to
the extent that it's already a problem
that other countries are complaining
that China is doing too much high tech
manufacturing—I guess it makes sense
then, how could you have literally 10x
as many people doing the same thing?
You said that the government has
decided to prioritize this high tech
development rather than the growth rate.
You said that as if there's a trade off.
But naively, isn't high tech
supposed to lead to growth?
Why are we on this Pareto frontier with
technological development and growth?
Here you get to a sort of
conceptual fork in the road.
In many respects the communist
leaders in China have a lot in common
conceptually with the techno optimists
of Silicon Valley in their, what I
would call, technological fetishism.
The
Chinese leadership throughout the last
40 years, but even going back further,
has had this notion that technological
upgrading is the key to wealth and power.
The fundamental idea here goes back
to the 1840s when you had this great
Chinese empire that had been sitting
around for a thousand years doing great.
They thought they were
the best in the world.
Then these upstarts from England come and
crush them repeatedly, militarily, and
impose this very humiliating political
settlement on them through the Opium Wars.
The basic analysis among the
Chinese elites was, "Okay, we
fell behind technologically.
Therefore we must catch
up technologically.
This is the central thing
that we need to do."
This was recognized among some
elites, but it ran into a lot of
encrusted political pressure in
the late imperial Chinese regime.
They didn't get very far.
After the empire fell in 1911
you had a republican government.
Basically, if you look back at the things
that they were saying and doing, they're
pretty similar to what the Chinese
Communist Party has been saying and doing.
They just did them
somewhat less effectively.
They were dealing with civil
wars and various other problems.
The basic insight remained
the same, "We need to catch up
with the west technologically.
This is the fundamental thing.
It's just a question
of how do we do this?"
What the current regime in China
has been able to do is to take
that basic idea and actualize it.
They have been successful at this task
of technological upgrading and catch-up.
This is really central to the
conception of Chinese elite thinking.
The number one job of the government
is to figure out how to mobilize
the resources of Chinese society
so as to maximize technology
acquisition, creation, and upgrading.
Starting in the 1980s, that was
a big part of the philosophy.
But the other part of the philosophy
was just, "We have to grow as fast as
possible and we are fairly agnostic
as to where the growth comes from.
We realize that there are many
different sources of growth.
Foreign investment, exports,
construction, infrastructure.
We're going to do all of these things.
Basically the incentive structure
that they set up was just to
tell local officials that their
job was to maximize GDP growth.
That will make all of
these other things happen.
If they tell local government officials,
"Your job is to maximize technology
development, they'll do a lot of
dumb stuff and waste a lot of money.
That's not the right way to do it.
Let's just have GDP as the KPI.
The end."
That turned out to be
incredibly successful.
Then Xi Jinping comes
along in 2012 and says,
"The problem with this is
that it's now gone too far.
It's led to a lot of corruption,
it's led to a lot of inequality.
It's led to a lot of local governments
doing wasteful and duplicative things.
Now we need to hunker down and focus a
little bit more on the really central
task, which is this technology task."
So less of "growth at all costs."
Basically, the implicit idea there
is, "We've got this figured out.
Growth will take care of itself.
We have a growth machine in China.
The resources of the government now
need to be focused on specifically
the technology question."
Everything that he has done—particularly
since about 2015-2016 when he
really started to see this come
into focus—has been, "Let's worry
less about the growth target and
more about the technology targets."
Particularly after Trump launched his
trade war and the Biden administration
followed that up with a lot of controls
on exports of technology to China,
the focus got intense.
They were saying, "The US really
wants to prohibit, constrain
our technological rise.
They kind of have the ability to do so.
Therefore we have to double down on
efforts to replicate all of these core
technologies so that we're not reliant
on the US or its allies anymore.
We just have to go full tilt
on technology at all costs."
That was an
accelerant of this tendency.
But then there is also
a macroeconomic theory.
Go back and read some of the statements
that he put out in the late 2010s
about their vision of the future.
They talk about all these
technological developments.
They didn't mean Alibaba and Tencent and
all of these great Internet companies.
They meant physical technology,
semiconductors, new material, green
energy, industrial robots, all this stuff.
Essentially their view was,
"This is going to be the
productivity engine of the future.
Growth in the overall economy and
incomes, it's all going to be driven
by these technological investments."
That is essentially what
they sincerely believe.
There are some problems with that.
The vast majority of people in the
economy do not work in those sectors.
You can get very good at
making semiconductors and
industrial robots and whatnot.
The people who work in those
industries do extremely well.
But that is a tiny fraction of
the totality of the population.
How do you have spillovers that enable
everyone in the economy—regardless
of how remote they are from this
engine room of the high tech
sector—to enjoy gains to income?
The answer in the United States
historically has been, "We're just going
to have this great consumer economy.
We're essentially going
to be demand driven.
Consumers will tell us what they want
and companies will arise to make what
they want, which is increasingly not
stuff, but services, experiences.
We will create a financial system
that produces very good financial
rewards for the companies and people
that produce these kinds of services."
Then you generate huge amounts
of actually very high paid
employment in the services economy.
The Achilles heel of any industrial
policy-driven growth model like
China—but you can see variants of
this basically throughout East Asia—is
that they are very materialist.
They're convinced that it's only
really the physical stuff that matters.
They think if you get really good
at making the physical stuff,
that will somehow magically spill
over into the rest of the economy.
The evidence that we have is that
that actually doesn't work that much.
Most of the demand in a modern industrial
economy, the really high wage, high income
economies, comes from intangible services.
There's a more complicated
interaction between this high tech
core and wider economic growth.
I don't see in China how they set up the
linkage between all these great high tech
industries that they have and 90% or so of
the economy which is doing something else.
I guess I still don't understand.
Point taken that maybe in the
short run these other sectors don't
generate as much growth as just
building more housing or something.
But by that same token they don't
take that much capital, in the scheme
of a national economy, to sustain.
If China wants to make a $100
billion fund for semiconductors, that
shouldn't detract from its ability…
I just don't understand why the macro
growth number has to go down for it
to be able to do that $100 billion
semiconductor fund or something.
It doesn't have to, but the way
that they have in fact executed this
tends to lead in that direction.
Here's why.
At the same time that they have been
doubling down on industrial policy,
they have also been much more tightly
regulating their service sectors.
Here’s a few examples.
The famous one is that they woke
up in November of 2020 and realized
that Alibaba's financial subsidiary
was about to do this gigantic IPO.
The premise of that was that China should
build a financial system that resembled
that of the United States in 2005 and
that this was a really smart idea.
They said, "Oh, actually that's
a really dumb idea because look
what that led to in the US.
We don't want securitization.
We do not want this financial
risk generation that Ant
Financial is trying to talk about.
We really need to crack
down on these guys."
So they did.
They were also simultaneously concerned
with a lot of other things that
the Internet platforms were up to.
So there was this broad-based regulation
of the Internet sector which, weirdly
for about 20 years, had operated
in a complete free-for-all land of
almost no regulation whatsoever,
except for political censorship.
Pretty much anything else you wanted
to do, you could do it with very
little government interference.
It was a strange exception to
the regulatory norm in China.
They finally caught up and said, "No,
no, we have to regulate all these guys."
They went around to all of the Internet
companies and basically told them, "There
are things that you can do that are fine
and there are things that you cannot do.
There are a lot of business models
that you might be interested in
doing, such as fintech, such as
telehealth, such as wider social media
applications that you may not do.
We think it creates too
much financial risk.
We think it creates too
much social stability risk.
We think it creates too much political
risk for us, the Communist party."
So a lot of the avenues of growth for
the Internet companies were shut down.
They still did okay.
They're still very big companies.
I think their share prices fell
way more than was justified
by the actual loss in revenue.
That's starting to correct itself.
Alibaba, Tencent, they're still great
companies and they're figuring it out.
But they were severely constrained.
They were much, much
more tightly regulated.
You look at the financial
sector generally.
It was significantly deregulated
from about 2008 to about 2017,
with some bad consequences.
Increased financial risk, shadow
banking, lots of bad stuff.
But you also got lots of good stuff.
Private companies, which were
essentially shut out of loan finance,
got the ability to finance themselves
through debt in the way that they
had not been able to previously.
You had a lot of new financial
services going to households.
Basically the government said, "No,
this is a little bit too dangerous.
We're going to re-regulate it."
Now most financial activity in China
has been constricted back into a small
number of basically state-owned banks.
So there was severe re-regulation
of the financial sector.
There was a lot of talk about the
healthcare sector, opening that up
much more to private entrepreneurship.
That again has been reined in.
So you can go down the list.
There has been a massive re-regulation
of the service sector which limits the
opportunities for profitable expansion
by companies, limits the opportunities
for entrepreneurship, and limits
the opportunities for employment.
But the examples you
mentioned all seem like
the potential growth was constrained
not because it was cutting off against
high tech development in other more
physical fields, but because it
was a threat to political power,
or to perceived social stability.
Growth has gone down because of all
these actions.
It doesn't seem like it's happened
because they needed that to happen
in order to get SMIC up to snuff.
No, It's a political choice.
That's right.
This is what happens if you say
technological development, particularly in
hardware, will solve all of our problems.
It will generate all this
growth and so therefore we
don't need this service sector.
We have a real life experiment.
What happens if you do that?
What happens if you do that
is you get a lot of progress
in the technological sectors.
You get basically a persistent
shortage of aggregate demand, which
means that even the people who are
making all this great technology
stuff don't have any pricing powers.
They have to keep lowering their prices.
So you get deflation.
When you get deflation and less
employment growth, at the household level
people say, "Oh, people aren't hiring.
I guess I need to save more and spend less
because my income is not going to go up."
You create the risk of this
deflationary spiral which they're
sort of on the edge of right now.
Again, this gets back to the
techno-optimist view of things.
If you have this very narrow view of
the economy as purely the expression of
the emanation from this technological
core, you're missing a lot of stuff.
You will basically take yourself into
a blind alley if you think that that
is going to solve all your problems.
The Chinese government in the last few
months I think has begun to recognize
this and say, "Oh, actually we need to
have some kind of a demand strategy."
This is very evident in
their top level statements.
The problem is they've been working for 45
years to build this magnificent machine of
investment and industry and manufacturing.
They're very, very good at it.
But they have basically devoted no
time in the last 45 years to figuring
out how to create a demand machine.
They're just at the very early stages of
figuring out that part of the problem.
There's another problem with this focus on
specific parts of technology development.
In any field you understand well
enough, you realize how contingent
and random the steps leading up
to what we now consider to be this
self-contained high tech thing were.
The field I know better than others is AI.
There's just so many weird things.
People wanted to play video games
and so we had decades of progress in
making these graphics processing units
which contributed to AI development.
People were just posting on
Reddit, on Twitter and so forth.
That fossil fuel of data has
been powering these AI models.
The idea that you could have just said
in 2000, "We want to make progress
towards AGI" and somehow that would
have led somewhere as opposed to
what actually ended up happening.
You can scale that analogy up to
China, just its total economy.
In terms of how they got here, the
thing you want to be careful about
is that this was not the result
of some carefully crafted master
plan that they knew all along.
It was a lot of groping
and a lot of random stuff.
They did one thing for one reason
and another thing for another reason.
Then through this random process,
it all coalesced in the end.
The amount of intelligent design behind
that was I think actually quite low.
They got a few big
directional things correct.
They stuck with them.
That's where I would give policy credit.
They were also willing to adapt
when things were obviously not
working and cut things off and
adjust with pretty high frequency.
But a lot of it was essentially a
random walk where a lot of things
that were enabled then started to
interact with each other in the
way that you talked about with AI.
Then they create these other results
which could not have been preplanned.
Another thing to consider when discussing
the virtue of such a system is that
you can't just look at the results
over the course of 20-30 years and
say, "Since they were able to pick
the key technologies over this period,
therefore this system is preferable."
It's somewhat similar to looking at
one successful dictator and saying,
"Because they made the right calls,
dictatorship is the right model."
I actually don't know that much about what
Japan was doing from the 40s to the 70s.
But I assume MITI, or whatever,
made some right calls about which
electronics and cars are important.
But in order to judge, how plausible
is it that this level of competence and
foresight and luck or whatever mixture
they're in will continue into AI.
What happens after that?
Whatever's required as an input
into that, speaking of which,
let me ask you about that.
Well, actually can I just stop you there.
There are a couple of things that
you touched on there that I think
are really interesting that I'd just
like to put on a little bit more.
Past results are no guarantee
of future returns, right?
Just because you did it before
doesn't mean you can keep doing it.
We're seeing that now in the US.
A few years ago, I would have said
I had very high confidence that the
US will be able to retain the basic
political system and structure that
it's had for a really long time.
That's one of its enduring strengths,
that that infrastructure remains.
I'm much less confident about that.
Similarly, in China, you have
this problem that they've had a
succession of top leaders since
Deng Xiaoping with very different
styles and power bases and so forth.
They've managed to succeed
through a range of these things.
That gives you more confidence that
they're probably more likely to do
it right in the future than not.
But there are still a lot
of concerns about that.
Xi Jinping has basically declared
himself president for life.
We haven't been in that situation
in China for a long time.
Last time we had that,
it did not end well.
There's always been a trade off
between growth and control in China.
This is kind of the central dilemma
that the Communist Party has had,
"We want as much growth as possible,
but we also want to maintain a
pretty high level of control."
That pendulum has swung much
more towards the control side of
the equation the last few years.
Growth is slowing.
So you have a lot of problems.
However, I would make a couple of points.
One is that China has been successful
in its industrial policy less so because
they picked the right industries and more
because they were very adept at building
the right enabling infrastructure.
I would point to two things in particular.
One was a program that they had starting
in the 1990s, which in English has the
very ungainly name of informatization.
So it translates to the
Chinese term xìnxīhuà.
It means informatization, taking
information technology and
putting it everywhere in society.
They were early adopters of the IT
revolution, including the Internet.
If you think back to the discourse around
the Internet in the late 1990s, everyone
was saying the Internet was the death
knell of authoritarian regimes because it
empowered everyone to have information.
Information control is no longer possible.
Social control is no longer possible.
Would that that were true, right?
The Chinese government very, very
early said, "No, that is wrong."
We think that the Internet
can be an instrument.
We can use it to, number one, promote
technological development at a high
speed in China, and number two,
enhance our control of society.
They have been proved absolutely
correct in that bet on both counts.
They had a drive to
network the entire society.
They started to invest in very, very
early, initially just through ordinary
fixed line telecoms networks, but then
they were very early in mobile and then
getting government network systems that
communicated across the whole country.
They invested huge amounts in that.
It's been, I think, very beneficial
to the rise of all kinds of things.
It's why basically they were able to
create an entire Internet of their own
with its own companies that doesn't
have the participation of the US
global companies and is on its own
terms basically just as successful.
What they also recognized was
that if everyone's on the Internet,
and we have people watching
the Internet, then we know what
everyone is thinking all the time.
We can see that.
This is
the holy grail of Chinese leadership
since the second century B.C.
"We sit on top of this vast empire.
It's great.
We have all this territory, all
of this wealth is flowing in.
But we have no idea what people
are thinking or doing far away."
This has bedeviled every Chinese
administration for thousands of years.
Even into the 1990s, it was an
authoritarian system but it was very
fragmented and it was very, very hard
for the central government to really
have any idea what was going on.
Now we have a panopticon
because everyone is online.
If we control the online universe,
then we see everything and we're
pretty confident that we can
keep the discourse under control.
They won that bet.
The comparable move that they
are making today, which I think
is severely underappreciated, is
that they believe in the power of
electrification.
Electricity has been
around for a long time.
But still in most countries it only
accounts for about 15-20% of the
total final consumption of energy.
It is still actually a minor player
in the global energy equation, despite
having been around for 150 years and being
very critical in a lot of applications.
China very early on recognized that
they needed a lot more electric power.
The original reason was very prosaic.
They had a lot of power shortages
in the early 2000s that were making
it hard for their factories to run.
They said, "Oh, we have to build a
lot more generating capacity, most
of it fueled by coal, just so we
can keep our factories running."
That was the first thing.
Then they started to think about it
a little bit more and they started
to say, "Actually, what do we want?
Well, we know we're failing in
this drive to make cars with
industrial combustion engines.
It looks like we're never going to
be able to crack that nut and have
our own Toyota or General Motors.
But no one's making electric cars.
Maybe we can be the first to do electric
cars" So they said, "We got to do that."
Then they said, "Oh, we need to enhance
our domestic transport infrastructure.
Wouldn't it be great if we had a giant
high speed rail network just like
Japan, except we're 20 times larger than
Japan, so it has to be 20 times as big.
Let's do that.
By the way, this is all going to be
electrified."So they created a
couple of core hub industries.
The premise for them was that you need
gigantic quantities of electricity
to get these things working.
If everyone has an electric car
and everyone's charging their
battery, it’s a huge draw.
If everyone is riding on electric
trains instead of on planes,
it's a huge draw on electricity.
So we need to have a much more
comprehensive idea about what our
electricity grid is going to look
like to support these industries
that we want for other reasons.
Well,
where do we want this
electricity to come from?
Well, coal.
Yeah, we have a lot of
coal, but it's really dirty.
It's a climate problem.
It's a very severe domestic
air pollution problem.
This is really dirty.
So from an energy security and pollution
standpoint, we're probably better off
doing renewables because any other
source of fuel for thermal power
plants, we're gonna have to import.
We don't have enough natural gas.
We can build nuclear, but that's hard to
scale and we don't have enough uranium.
If we build a renewable powered
domestic electricity grid, we
will be self-sufficient forever.
You don't have to import the sun
or the wind, it's just there.
You can see how these things
begin to build on one another.
Again, it was not that they had the
intelligent design plan in the year 2000.
It was just sort of all these
things that came together.
The result is today, China has
generating capacity that is more than
double that of the United States.
Their renewable generation capacity
alone is as big as the entire generation
capacity of the United States.
Electricity as a whole is now about 30%
of China's total energy consumption.
It's going up like this,
it's rising very rapidly.
Everyone else is increasing
their electricity consumption
very, very marginally.
Now you see it in things like AI.
What is one of the big
constraints on AI development?
At scale, it is essentially the power
that you need to power these data centers.
Who is best placed in the
world to do this at home?
China.
They have also concluded that AI aside,
having cheap abundant electricity is
really central to all of the major
growth industries of the 21st century.
They are now determined, I think,
on a strategic basis to have an
electricity system that just produces
as much power as humanly possible from
whatever fuel source you can find.
They want to interconnect this via
grid as efficiently as you can,
so they're leaders in ultra high
voltage distribution technology.
They will be able to keep our electricity
prices so low that it will be very
difficult for anyone anywhere else in the
world to compete with their manufacturing,
with their AI, with their whatever,
anything that electricity goes into.
They will have this competitive advantage.
I think they're basically
right about that.
The point here is that if you're able
to get a few of these sort of enabling
all-purpose technology decisions right
earlier and then scale them up, then
a lot of good things can happen as
a result of that, regardless of how
effective you are at picking winners
sector by sector in industrial policy.
What is the story in which
China doesn't win AI?
In terms of the talent of AI
researchers themselves, it's a big
country with lots of smart people.
That will be there.
We've already seen examples with
High-Flyer and DeepSeek where they
can come close to the frontier.
In terms of chips, eventually SMIC
will be able to produce the kinds
of H100 equivalents that the 5
nanometer process a TSMC can produce.
I don't know how many years away it is.
Export controls might
have still been net good.
But this is not something that will
not happen within the next 5-10 years.
Then it's a matter of scaling, scaling
production of the chips, scaling energy
scaling, maybe people and data collection.
What is China good at?
It's scaling.
I think the numbers on energy production
are just absolutely staggering.
What is the time interval in
which China adds an America-sized
amount of power generation?
Well, they add basically a France
or UK on average every year.
Extrapolate that forward.
So far we've been focused especially
on the training of AI models.
When these models start becoming super
economically productive—basically by
the point at which they are at human
level—the more important question
will be how many can you deploy?
Why is China such a powerful country
or America such a powerful country?
A big part of the reason is
we just have more people.
That's why China could take over Taiwan.
China has like a billion people
and Taiwan has like 20 million.
Now you just have more AIs, more
AI people if you have more power,
which is ultimately what's upstream.
That
was all just a preface for asking,
in 2035 what is the story of how
China doesn't absolutely dominate AI?
It's a good question and we're
verging a little bit beyond my realm
of competence here because I don't
pretend to understand AI very well.
I'm still very unclear as to economically
where all the benefit accrues.
Let’s abstract away from AI
and just think about this.
This is a situation where you've got a
new technology, it's entering society.
What is the innovation cycle
that's going to drive it?
I'm pretty partial to theories of
innovation like the one that was
propounded by a guy named Amar
Bhidé who wrote a book a number of years
ago called The Venturesome Economy.
What he stresses there is the
feedback loop between consumer
demand and what producers are doing.
His view is that we focus too much on
what the producers are doing and not
enough on what the consumers are driving.
I think that's a pretty
good insight generally.
It helps explain a lot of why the
US has maintained its position
with such a dynamic economy, even
though we've abandoned a lot of the
physical processes that underlie it.
So my question is, "Okay
economically, when we say AI, what's
the most important part of it?
Is it the large language models?"
I think the consensus is no.
That's just the substrate.
What really matters are the
specific applications that
get built on top of that.
That's where most of the economic
benefit is going to accrue.
If that idea is correct, then the
question you want to ask yourself is,
"What economic system offers the most
fertile ground for people figuring
out how to use AI in specific zones?"
There I would give the US a fairly
strong edge over China because
China has become more self-enclosed.
They have become more obsessed
with self-sufficiency.
They've made it very, very difficult
for other people to operate in China.
It's creating some difficulties in
people operating outside of China.
They have this walled garden of
Chinese people and whatever they
do that creates applications.
But whoever the big US or Western AI
operators are, they have the entire
rest of the world to play with.
That's a much bigger universe.
I would rate the likelihood that you
get interesting applications higher
outside the Chinese walled garden.
So
if you want the case for why China
does not dominate, I think something
like that would be the reason why.
A previous guest I just had on,
Victor Shih, said that the Chinese
government might be reluctant to let
AI development go full speed because
of the destabilizing effects it might
have on the political system or the
inability potentially to control it.
What's your sense on what will happen as
AI becomes more economically valuable,
a focal point in discussions about
technological development and so forth?
I have a lot of respect for Victor.
I think he has a very good grasp of
the Chinese bureaucratic mindset and
how political calculations get made.
That's his territory more than mine.
So I'm very respectful of that view.
I however tend to think that the
Chinese are going to be pretty in
favor of high-speed AI development.
The reason is essentially the same reason
that I was talking about earlier, about
informatization and electrification.
This is essentially a basic enabling
technology that is useful for all
of the things that can flow from it.
My hunch would be that they would make
the same bet with AI that they made
with the Internet back in the 90s.
With the Internet they said, "This
technology could be dangerous, it
could be out of our control, but we
think actually it's going to be really
beneficial and that we can control it."
That bet paid off for
them very, very well.
My hunch is that they will look
at AI as a similar sort of thing.
Yes, it's possible that this could get out
of our control, but we think unbalanced,
this is really important technology.
It's going to enable a lot of other
things and we'll probably be able to
figure out how to control it because
our control systems are so good.
It is interesting because if you
look at the big development in
Chinese AI recently, DeepSeek,
it was not the result
of some state program.
It was the result of basically a quant
hedge fund guy in Hangzhou sitting
around and saying, "Oh, I could
actually build a pretty good LLM model
flowing out of my quant activities.
Let's give it a go, see how it happens."
It worked great for him.
The reports that I have seen
suggest that this created a certain
amount of disquiet in Beijing.
They said, "Well, where did this
guy come from and why is he not
coming out of the official plan?"
So there is some risk that they
would be a little bit nervous
about freelancing on this.
But on the whole I think they'll
see this as another basic enabling
technology that they should promote and
figure out how to control over time.
To the extent that China's advantages
lie in its ability—in situations
where centralization is important—to
do it… Ironically, this might be a
case where centralization might be
helpful and they might not do it
because there are these tremendous
economies of scale in AI training.
You have to keep increasing
the training cost by
4x every single year.
Especially given that the availability of
these advanced chips is lower in China,
it would be even more helpful to have one
person who can use them all for training.
This might be the situation where it
would make more sense for the government
to say, Huawei and ByteDance, you have
to give all your chips to High-Flyer.
I think we can say with high confidence
that that's not going to happen.
As powerful as the Chinese government
is, they do not have the ability to
force everyone into one room for this.
Huawei's got its own thing going.
Bytedance is going to
have its own thing going.
Xiaomi is going to have
its own thing going.
Alibaba is going to have
its own thing going.
All of these have sufficiently large
revenue streams and access to capital
that they can move independently.
They will also be able to leverage their
connections within the system, both
at the central level and the local
government level where they get a lot
of their support to do their own thing.
You will not have a national
monopoly solution to this.
That almost never occurs in China.
Interesting.
That's a significant statement and
maybe updates me downwards on the
probability of China winning in AI.
I think one of their key
advantages would have been—
So you think the fragmentation
becomes an obstacle.
Yeah, especially given the
availability of compute in China.
Right.
The ability to concentrate your
limited compute resources in one
thing instead of scattered around.
I think that's a fair point.
That then comes back to how fast can
they solve the chip problem domestically.
If they can solve that really fast,
then that constraint goes away.
One thing that will be important
as this AI stuff is happening,
is to have something that is
equivalent to the red telephone.
I do buy some of the crazy or scary
stories about what could happen with AI.
It’s not necessarily because God takes
over, but more so… It's happened many
times in human history that some more
coordinated group has managed to do
some coup or slowly take over control.
It’s the kind of thing Cortés did or
Pizarro did.
A key way that can be prevented, or a
way we can reduce the risk of that, is
that different human groups should be
in tight contact with each other and
have the same kind of mechanism that
vaccination creates with diseases.
The key advantage that the Spanish had
over the New World empires was that the
Spanish knew how each previous conquest
had gone, but the Incas and the Aztecs
didn't know about what strategies were
used, how horses work, how steel works.
How that translates here is that there
might be some crazy things these AIs try.
Especially if you have this bifurcated
world, which is actually very valuable
from an alignment and safety perspective
because you have this independent
experiment or independent lineage… If
their AI tries to do something crazy, it's
very important that they feel that they
can tell us and we do the exact opposite.
It's a long preamble to ask the
question of how we set up that
kind of high trust or prerequisite
understanding on these kinds of issues.
That is a terrific question.
That really gets to the
heart of a lot of stuff.
I don't have a great answer to that
because fundamentally what you're
saying is that there needs to be
a communication system, a network
of interactions between two highly
competitive zones, the US and China,
where they have to be able to
operate with some degree of trust.
I think the problem that we face
in trying to analyze this is a lot
of the analogies that you might
reach for break down at some point.
You brought up the red telephone,
which basically is a reference to
the line of communication the US and
Soviet Union had during the Cold War.
The threat that you were trying to
avert there was nuclear holocaust.
In
some ways I think that's an apt
analogy and we kind of need to
think broadly along those terms.
But the specific problem that we
were dealing with there were these
very self-contained systems that
were clearly under highly centralized
control by a couple of people.
So having that one-to-one line
of communication was an effective
response to that particular problem.
With AI, it's much more diffuse,
much more decentralized, much more
unpredictable, what the problems could be.
It's kind of easy, I think, to
create… Easy, we say in retrospect,
but it was hard at the time.
But it was a sort of, if you will, maybe
a two or three dimensional process to
come up with game theory to enable us
to manage the nuclear balance of terror.
I
don't want to minimize Thomas
Schelling's achievement.
It was great.
But it was like a two or
three dimensional problem.
With AI, you have a more than
three dimensional problem.
It is consequently more difficult to
figure out how to create a game theory
solution to this that is kind of stable.
I think what you can say at a minimum
right now is that there are ways in
which the US-China relationship today
resembles that of the United States
and the Soviet Union in the 1950s,
before the Cuban Missile Crisis.
I don't want to exaggerate this too
much, but the sort of diminution in
exchange in communication over the last
six or seven years is really alarming.
I’ll
give a simple example on this.
When Trump came into office the first time
in 2017, he inherited a structure where
there were approximately 100 working-level
dialogues between US government
and Chinese government officials.
Plus you had all of this investment in
private sector stuff that was going on.
But just at the formal level,
there were over 100 dialogues.
He got rid of all of them,
100%.
He then replaced them with
one, which was the trade talks
that he had in his first term.
That was the only mechanism
that we had of communication.
Did this create a specific problem?
It did.
If you look at the early stages of
COVID, back when SARS came out in 2003,
there were staff members of the
United States Centers for Disease
Control embedded in the Chinese
Centers for Disease Control or
their equivalent organization.
That
relationship, in fact, grew
significantly, in part because
of SARS over subsequent years.
That was a very, very useful
channel of getting information out.
It was not perfect, it
had plenty of problems.
But the absence of that channel, I
think, was really catastrophic in the
early days of COVID where we literally
had no way of understanding what was
going on within the Chinese system.
There was no back channel that enabled
us to get even a little bit of a
head start on what was going on.
I think that had very,
very dire consequences.
You can probably trace many, many, many
deaths and a lot of social chaos to
the inability of the US and China to
communicate at that critical moment.
We have essentially dismantled the
whole structure of communication.
The Biden administration
basically took the same view.
They introduced a few more things.
There were a few more communication
channels that they handed off to Trump
that I think have not been made use of.
So we're back to essentially
zero, except for the trade.
That is a very, very dangerous
situation to be in with regard to
global public health, any kind of
global coordination, whether it be on
macroeconomics or climate efforts or
whatever <nd on these issues like AI.
I think that's a really bad place to be.
We're starting at a
rather dangerous position.
It should be a priority to
figure out how we can get there.
It's very hard to see how we get
there given the political environment,
frankly, in both countries.
In the United States you have this
narrative that China is this bad
actor, they have an illegitimate
government, they are a systemic rival.
We basically have to contain,
constrain, control them.
Any kind of interaction with them
is in and of itself dangerous.
You have people in Congress saying,
"I don't want to go to China.
There's no point in going to China
because I'll pay a political price for it.
If I go there, I will be tarred
as someone who went to China
and therefore is tainted.
And what can I possibly learn?
I already know what I need to know."
So you have a deliberate effort in the
United States to reduce the channels of
information that we have with China and
direct experience, which is very bad.
I think one of the bad outcomes of
COVID in China was that they kind of
locked themselves off from the rest
of the world for almost three years.
They got really obsessed
by this self-sufficiency
industrial policy complex.
The Chinese system has always had
a lot of difficulty communicating
with the rest of the world.
This has been persistent for
many decades and centuries.
This gave them a great excuse to just
not do the thing that made them feel
very uncomfortable, which is engage in
communication with the rest of the world.
They concluded that that was kind of okay.
So
they also retreated into a very sort
of paranoid narrative about what the
US is up to, which is to a significant
degree justified but not entirely.
I think they lost sight of the value
of a really robust communications
alliance with the rest of the world.
Both sides are entrenched
in very suspicious,
self-reinforcing narratives about the
other, which makes it incredibly difficult
to forge a better communication system.
I have to say I'm fairly critical
of both the Biden administration and
the Trump administration, different
ways of how they handled this.
I think the Biden administration could
have done a lot more, a lot faster.
I think they sort of had the idea
that it was good to have more
communication, but they waited for
two years before they did anything.
Then they were very parsimonious
about how they did it.
I think they could have
been much more aggressive.
They weren't.
That is a problem.
Then I think the Trump administration
unfortunately just doesn't place strong
value on having respectful communications
with anyone in the world, frankly.
Then when you compound this with the
paranoia about China, then it just creates
more—I don't want to say paranoia, that's
too loaded a term—but the suspicion, the
fear, the distrust of China that exists.
It's
very hard to see how you get it.
So I agree with you that we
need something like that.
I'm kind of pessimistic that we'll
get there anytime soon, unfortunately.
The red telephone point you made
is actually really interesting.
It didn't occur to me before
that AI is such a diffuse thing.
It's like saying we're going to have a red
telephone for the Industrial Revolution.
Yeah, exactly.
How do you do that?
You can't.
But on the point about the ability
of both sides to perceive each other…
It is true, as you say that because
maybe China has become more closed off,
their perception of what's happening
in America has been diminished.
I would argue that the
opposite is even more true.
Our understanding of China
is more limited than theirs.
A big part of this is just that
every country in the world has some
understanding of what's happening in
America because of the overwhelming
cultural significance, the charismatic
nature of American politics.
Everybody knows who the main senators and
Cabinet people are, all around the world.
When I visited China six months ago,
it was shocking to me that you could
go to cities with 20 million people
like Chongqing and Chengdu and… I
don't think I saw a single white
person in Chongqing, which is insane.
You're literally seeing seas of people
and none of them are from the West.
In fact, that was what motivated me,
that trip, to do these kinds of episodes.
I think people are right to say,
"Look, fundamentally I read a book
like this and I'm learning a lot
about how China tangibly works."
That’s opposed to, "I go there,
I'm going to chat up taxi drivers."
I'm not going to learn about whether
they're going to invade Taiwan by
chatting up taxi drivers, right?
The
kinds of things which should be
obvious—that probably aren't obvious
to these Congress people that are
cavalier about what information they
get, certainly wasn't obvious to me
at least on a sort of more subliminal
level—is just how big the country is.
I think people talk about it as if it's
like a small thing, "Oh, China's over
there and we're going to deal with it."
Especially when you think about
how we're going to change its
government, we're going to constrain
its global impact or something.
It's
really big.
It is really big.
It seems like a very banal observation,
and yet I keep coming back to it as one
of the fundamental facts that continues
to be underestimated about China.
It's just how big it is geographically
and in terms of population.
But the question there is, what
is the value of these things?
It's a fabulous book.
I'm very proud of it and a
few thousand people read it.
At any given moment over the last 15-20
years, there have been north of 300,000
Chinese students in the United States.
I don't know what the total number is
over time, but it is quite a large number.
The cumulative effect of personal
experiences can be gigantic,
particularly if it is extended over
time.It's really, really important.
Then you have the impact of these
more structured engagements.
You go as a tourist, you talk to some
taxi drivers, you see this and that.
What do you learn?
I'll give you a concrete example.
So one of my side gigs is that
for a number of years I taught
an executive MBA course at NYU on
China's economic rise, and what that
meant for companies and so forth.
Usually I had about 20-25
people in the class.
I taught it for three or four
years before COVID and then two or
three years after Covid started.
In the years that I taught it before
COVID, there were always reliably
four or five people in the class
that had spent some time in China.
Many of them had done so just as
part of this executive program.
Because part of what you got by signing
up for this EMBA is that they took
you on these global study tour trips
and you would go to this country or
that country and you would be there
for a couple weeks and you would talk
to a few companies and this and that.
It's pretty superficial.
But
what I found was that when I had a class
that had a few of these people sprinkled
in that had that experience, or a little
bit of work experience—or they may have
gone as a tourist, had some kind of
student experience or something—the class
discussions were always much more nuanced.
People did not retreat into
these sort of cartoon stereotypes
of what China was like.
Everyone who had been there could say,
actually it was a little bit different
because here's my personal experience.
Then the classes that I did after COVID
had set in, they weren't doing these
study tours so no one in the class had
been to China as part of the program.
Luck of the draw, I didn't find
any people who had been there
as part of work or whatever.
I had zero direct experience of China
in the class for a couple years.
The baseline view of what China was
was way more negative and much more
stylized and, dare I say, cartoonish.
They were essentially getting their
view formed entirely by whatever
they were picking up in the media
and from their preconceptions.
There was no check on that.
So I saw in just a very small but
very concrete way that if you don't
have people going back and forth and
there aren't some people in the mix,
you don’t get people who say, "Wait a
second, what you're saying doesn't make
any sense because I was there and I
saw this, and it's totally different."
I'm convinced that has a gigantic impact.
I think it's really, really damaging if
people in positions of authority in our
government and our political system refuse
to expose themselves to the actual reality
of what China is, which is essentially
what they're doing now by making it
politically impossible for anyone to go
to China and see what's going on there.
That is a very, very
dangerous place to be.
It's ignorance.
One of the things that drove me and many
Western China types crazy about
being in China for many, many years
is that you would go and frequently
you would have this experience.
You'd be sitting in a seminar
room or think tank or whatever.
Some Chinese experts would say, "We
Chinese, we understand America much better
than you Americans understand China."
For years and years I
basically thought this was BS.
First of all, most people
in China don't travel.
They have no idea.
Even in the expert class, they had a
fairly superficial kind of understanding.
So I always felt pretty confident that
I and people in my cohort, we understood
China just as well as they understood
the US and their blind spots towards
the US system were very, very clear.
For years and years that drove me
nuts when people would say that.
Now I think it's just completely true.
All you have to do is look
at the student numbers.
You have 300,000 Chinese students in
the US until their visas get revoked.
We're struggling to get to a
thousand US students in China.
In the US we closed down the
Chinese consulate in Houston as
part of a trade spat back in 2020.
China responded by closing
down our consulate in Chengdu.
It’s a complete disaster, the whole area
of western China, really important, that
we have no eyes on officially anymore.
We decided that their Xinhua
journalists are not really
journalists, which is sort of true.
So we forced them to register
as government agents.
The Chinese responded by kicking
out a lot of our journalists.
That was a massive own goal.
The types of interactions that US
people have directly on the ground in
China have been massively restricted
compared to what they were a decade ago.
That’s partly as a result of Chinese
government action, partly as a result
of really misguided actions on our
part, and partly because of just fallout
from COVID and various other things.
But where we are is bad.
There is an information asymmetry which
I think operates to the disadvantage
in the United States right now.
I worry that this sort of cycle of
escalation will seem in retrospect
to people—especially if it leads
to a hot conflict—as mystifying
as World War I seems to us now.
If it's instigated by something in
Taiwan, that's a different story there.
You can just tell a very
direct through line there.
But you look back at World War I,
why did Germany do what it did?
Was it worried about encirclement?
Why was it worried about encirclement?
There's this weird thing with
the Russian ambassador who didn't
get back in time or something.
It would just be this kind of
thing where it's like, "Why did
we have to have this adversarial
relationship with China again?"
Explain it to me when we're 50
years removed and the sort of
day to day news isn’t as salient.
I basically agree with that.
We should be spending a lot more
time trying to figure out how to
make this a workable relationship.
There's going to be competition,
there's going to be conflict.
There are some real conflicts of what
we define as core interests on either
side which are tough to resolve.
This is not easy.
But we basically both have to recognize…
This is more of a problem on the US side.
I think the Chinese recognize
that the US is not going anywhere.
There is a little bit of a meme in Chinese
foreign affairs circles with the decline
of the US and the rise of the east.
That is very officially popular.
I think most people don't really
believe that because they just
have too much confidence in the
long-run resilience of the US system.
I think they're basically
right about that.
I think we on the US side have to get
a little bit more attuned to the idea
that there is no end point to this.
This is a relationship
which will go on forever.
There's no winning, there's no
losing, there's just managing.
We need to do a much better job of
figuring out how to manage it and
keep the conflicts and friction
in as contained a zone as we can.
It’s not easy to
do.
There is this interesting volatility
in how people think China is doing.
Some piece of news will come out about
electric vehicles and people will be
like, "China will obviously dominate us".
Then maybe some economic data will come
out and they say, "China is collapsing."
People in their own countries have this
sense that a lot of things are happening.
Some things are going well,
some things are not going well.
But in 20 years, America's not going
to collapse and it's also not going
to have destroyed every other country.
There's a long-run trend.
Whether China has 1% higher growth rate or
1% lower, it's just going to be a powerful
nation at the technological frontier.
There's no sort of very immediate
implication of what exact growth
trajectory they are on, with respect to
the most important questions about how
we should engage with them and so forth.
That is a really important point.
I want to just dwell on that a little bit.
The attraction that people have
towards extreme narratives about
China—total domination or total
collapse or so forth—is very strong.
In my view it's a product of ignorance.
The less you know about the realities
of place, the more you can construct
these fictional stories which take
some truth and then absolutize it.
The more you know about reality,
it's more messy than that.
It’s neither that nor this.
That I think is just another argument
for why you have to have much more
deep engagement so people are engaging
with realities rather than fantasies.
You can see this again
in very mundane ways.
If you just look at the way that the Trump
administration has conducted its trade
negotiations with China, it was premised
on the notion that China's economy was
so weak that you hit them with tariffs
and they will immediately capitulate.
That was a ridiculous idea.
It's taken them a couple of rounds to
figure out, maybe that wasn't quite right
and we have to take this more seriously.
Getting away from the extreme
narratives is important in general.
I think also on the US side, also to
some extent in China as well, is that
a lot of the things in the US political
context are blamed on the rise of China.
We have this problem or that
problem because of China.
They are predominantly
exercises in scapegoating.
We were talking at the beginning of the
conversation about the change in the
industrial sector, hollowing out of US
manufacturing employment and so forth.
If you look at the trend of US
manufacturing employment as a share of
total employment, it’s a straight line
from 1946 to today that looks like this.
You cannot find the Cold War, you cannot
find the rise of Japan, you cannot
find NAFTA, you cannot find China.
You cannot find anything.
What you find basically is the
march of technological progress.
That's basically what that line tells you.
So all of these stories about
China did this or China did
that… There was some impact.
But mainly what the United States
failed to do as the world was
transforming in the late 90s and
early 2000s, was to take seriously our
responsibility to change our systems
of redistribution, helping people out.
We failed on the social
contract domestically.
There were failures of domestic policy
which were then blamed on China.
I think similarly, if you look at
scare stories about how China's
going to take over the world…
BYD is a very good company.
Huawei is a very good company.
CATL is a very good company.
You look at the totality of
the corporate universe in the
world, it's still pretty big.
US companies are incredibly powerful and
adept across many technological sectors.
They are very good at what they do.
In many cases, they still have very
strong positions in China because
they're so much better at what they
do than the Chinese competitors.
We're dealing with the rise of a
new entrant on the global stage.
That's uncomfortable and
there's some jostling there.
But we should also not
overstate the degree to which,
even on a sort of a commercial
industrial side, that we are sort
of existentially threatened by this.
There's some real challenges there,
but a lot of this notion is that
we will not have an auto industry
in five years because of BYD…
Let's get a grip, folks.
We could end up there, but if we end
up there it's because we will have
made a bunch of really bad policy
decisions that got us there, not
because this competitive threat exists.
Mostly it's on us to figure out
how to get things right on our
own terms, within our own system.
Then I think basically we'll be fine.
But right now that isn't where
the conversation is particularly.
You first went to China in 1980.
’85.
You've been visiting and living
there on and off ever since.
We're all aware that obviously China's
developed a lot since then and so forth.
What are some non-obvious changes you've
seen or maybe even things that have
stayed the same through all this change?
I often describe China as a
very turbulent and very deep ocean.
You skim along the top and you see
the huge waves: all the stuff that's
been built, all of the cities, the
high rises, the industrial parks,
the high speed rail and so forth.
Then you go below that and there's a
very deep still ocean of ideas, concepts,
bureaucratic tendencies and so forth that
have built up over centuries that in a
lot of ways does not change that much.
I think about what the United States
was like socially in 1985 compared
to what it is today in terms of the
space for gay and lesbian people, trans
people, social acceptance of different
lifestyles, awareness and attention paid
to racial issues, all these kinds of
things.
The changes that have occurred in the
United States over the last 40 years
are substantially greater than the
changes that have occurred in China
over that time period in terms of
people's fundamental understanding of
how we interact together in a society.
Partly that just reflects that
the US is intrinsically a somewhat
more complex society than China
with all of these layers of races,
the whole immigrant experience.
Just in terms of the number of
foreign-born people, it was much
lower in ’85 than it was today.
But socially we are much more… There's
just been a lot more change and a
lot more evolution of people's basic
attitudes towards what they think about
society and how we should interact.
China in that sense has been more stable.
It's more cohesive, it's more attached
to rather deep-rooted notions of
gender relations, patriarchy, and
how society should hang together.
So as we think about all of the change
that occurred in China, which is real—and
some of the changes in social relations
that have come with the abolition of
the planned economy system and the
replacement by this basically capitalist
system with a Leninist political
carapace—those are very significant.
So I don't want to underestimate
how much transformation has gone
on in China over that period.
I think it's been substantial, but in
the US it's been even more in many ways.
That is something that's worth
reflecting on, particularly
as we do these comparisons.
There's a kind of intrinsic
churning dynamism to the American
system that is just always there.
It is often very uncomfortable to live
through and we're living through a very
particularly uncomfortable moment now.
In China there's some of that, but
there's a lot of containment and
there's more stasis in a lot of the
fundamental social relationships.
I lived in China more or less full
time until 2015, and then I started
doing half and half after that.
Now I principally live in New York.
One of the things that always struck
me when I would come back from
China to the US is just how much
grassroots cultural activity you
have all over the United States.
We have a very distributed
system of cultural activity here.
In China you have a few big cultural
hotspots where things happen,
and then it's all kind of placid.
The variety of experience that you
have in the US is still unrivaled.
You were talking earlier about the fact
that there's still this huge discrepancy
between the average income in China
and the average income in the US.
This is partly a reflection of that.
It's still, on average, a much
poorer society than the US.
So the surplus that's available for
people to do stuff that's interesting, but
not economically productive in a narrow
sense, that space is still a lot smaller.
It's not just political
repression that's doing that.
It's
a combination of the level of income and
just the ingrained social structures.
The broader point you're making
here is important to emphasize.
Sometimes
if people are hawkish on
China, they have the sense that
they're doing everything wrong.
They're this aggressive,
belligerent power.
This is the new Stalin or Hitler.
But conversely, when people say that
there should be a productive relationship,
then there's also this other attractor
state where people are just so
uncomfortable with cognitive dissonance
that they say, "You can see how well
their system works, central planning
works, authoritarianism works."
Right, let's not take those lessons.
Those are very bad lessons.
You just see those two patterns of
correlation so often that it's worth
emphasizing that you can have a
productive relationship with a country
and still think that not only is
authoritarianism morally wrong, but it
actually has had bad impacts on growth
or on the day-to-day life of people
and their culture or whatever else.
I think people sometimes have
trouble just holding two thoughts in
their head at the same time there.
There's also a very strong pattern.
There have been a few good
books written about this.
American attitudes towards China
in particular have tended to swing
from one extreme to the other.
Americans and Chinese are kind of the
same because they're both pragmatic.
They like money, they like business.
If you go to China, it's very
easy in my experience to chat
with people and get along.
So that level of
connection is fairly easy.
Then the other swing of the pendulum
is that they're this enormous
amorphous force that is committed to
a devilish system that we don't like.
Finding the middle ground in
that historically has been very,
very difficult for the US to do.
Final question.
Right now, the US and China are
engaged in this negotiation to
figure out some somewhat stable way
to come back from Liberation Day.
What is the most positive, plausible
story of what comes out of this?
My expectations for this are very low.
I think the basic problem here
is that we have on the US side
a collection of grievances and complaints
that have not coalesced into a very
coherent agenda of what we want from
ourselves and what we want from China.
If you don't know what you yourself
want and you don't know what you want
from the other party, it's very hard to
engage in a constructive negotiation.
That's my fundamental take
on where we are right now.
This is a normative statement
but to me, what we should be
aiming for is trying to figure out
what are the terms of coexistence
between the US and China in
the coming years and decades.
The most desirable outcome would be
some kind of an agreement under which
we create a broader permission structure
for Chinese companies to invest in the
United States in a lot of these key
industries that we're talking about.
I think that's good for the United States
because I think it is reasonable for
us to try and rebuild certain aspects
of our industrial manufacturing system.
I think we let those atrophy too much.
So selectively, it does make sense
for us to try and rebuild that.
Rebuilding that should incorporate
the best anywhere in the world.
Some of that is now coming from China.
I also think—just in terms of enhancing
mutual understanding and getting better
communication channels—investment is even
more than trade a very good communication
channel because it forces you to go to the
other guy's place and put down roots there
and figure out how things work and figure
out ways to communicate with one another.
Now the obstacles to that are enormous,
both because of the US narrative
that this is intrinsically unsafe
and because I think the Chinese will
be very reluctant to allow a lot of
their technology High-Flyers to go
and set up in the US and risk having
their technology leak away there too.
So I'm not saying that that is easy or
achievable, certainly not in a few months.
This would be over the course of a year
or two or three, you might be able to
negotiate some terms of engagement there.
The big problem that China creates for the
world as a whole right now is this fact
that they just are unwilling or unable to
generate enough domestic demand to keep
their own economy running at full steam.
That's bad for their own economy.
It creates a lot of friction
in the rest of the world.
What it then means is that companies
that can't sell in China are forced
to export their surplus production.
This creates rising trade frictions,
not just with the United States,
but with lots and lots of countries.
It does contribute to the narrative
that China is not really all that
interested in creating a situation where
everyone benefits from their growth.
It's much more a "We're
in this for ourselves."
It would be helpful for the world
economy, helpful for the Chinese people,
and helpful for general stability,
if the Chinese could recognize that
they need to do a lot more to promote
the demand side of their economy.
It can't just all be about endless
investments in new technologies.
I think they're coming to a point
where they may be forced into that.
If you look at
most of the metrics that I and my
team follow of return on investment
in China, they're going down.
The number of zombie companies that
still exist but don't even generate
enough revenue to pay the interest
cost and their debt, that's going up.
There's a lot of pressure that's
building within the Chinese system
because of this obsessive concern
with the supply side of the economy.
They'll continue to do quite well
overall in technology production, but
the financial constraints are rising.
They have some self-interest
here in coming up with a
more balanced economic model.
Having some pressure from the outside to
get them in that direction would be good.
The final point I would make on this
though is that on the US side—which
is of course where I generally
sit—it really is critical to have
a realistic understanding of what's
happening in China and how they're
interacting with the rest of the world.
One of the big dangers that we have
in the current Trump administration
strategy—which was also to some degree
apparent in the Biden administration
strategy—is that there is this belief
that China can be contained and that you
can essentially construct an alliance
of countries that will stand up to
China and try to constrain it with you.
It's kind of a replay or dusting off of
the Cold War playbook where you had the
Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, you
had the United States and NATO and all
of the informal allies everywhere else.
You had the blocs against each
other and the bigger and more
economically productive bloc won.
That is just not going to work.
The Chinese have seen this
coming for a long time.
They have long had the view that the
US was going to try and constrain them.
They said, "How do we get around this?"
Their answer is not, "You build a
bloc, I'll build a bloc against that."
Their answer is, "I will operate
so that it is impossible for you
to build the bloc that you want."
Look at China's international engagements.
More countries have China as their
number one trade partner than
any other country in the world.
140 countries trade more with China
than they do with the United States,
which was not true during the Cold War.
You go to Southeast Asia or Latin
America and you say, "How would you
like to join our anti-China alliance?"
They will say, "No way,
this makes no sense for me.
I import a lot of my industrial inputs
from China, a lot of my consumer goods.
This is really a critical relationship.
I might have some concerns about the
trade balance, but I am not going to go
up against this country that is now either
my number one or my number two economic
partner, certainly on the trade side and
increasingly on the investment side."
So that is a non-viable strategy.
It will never work.
China has integrated itself into the
global economy very successfully.
This is just a fact that
we need to live with.
We need to have a
strategy that recognizes this is
a reality but that there are a lot
of strengths that the US has to
bear if it's willing to play them.
We have the advantages of a dynamic
system and frankly, a lot more
creativity and flexibility in our
financial system than the Chinese do.
It's perfectly possible to come
up with a coexistent scenario
in which we do really well.
We have domestic policies that
sort out our own imbalances,
both economic and social.
We have a significant degree of engagement
with China that is competitive, but
hopefully can be bounded so that we don't
wind up in a hot conflict situation that
would be the worst of all possible worlds.
All right, that's a good note to close on.
Arthur, thanks so much

Great.
