You're
 listening
 to
 Mistreated.
 I'm
 Nam


Kiwanuka.
 Brain
 health
 is
 a
 woman's


issue.
 Those
 are
 the
 words
 of
 Lynn


Pausland's
 the
 founder
 and
 president


[music]


of
 the
 Women's
 Brain
 Health
 Initiative,


which
 recently
 hosted
 Canada's
 inaugural


Women's
 Brain
 Health
 Summit
 in
 Toronto.


So,
 why
 is
 brain
 health
 a
 women's
 issue?


Women
 get
 migraines
 three
 times
 more


than
 men.
 And
 studies
 show
 that
 for


women
 aged
 18
 to
 49,
 migraines
 are
 the


leading
 cause
 of
 disability
 around
 the


world.


Some
 studies
 show
 that
 women
 are
 twice


as
 likely
 to
 be
 diagnosed
 with
 anxiety


and
 depression.
 According
 to
 CAMH,


women's
 symptoms
 for
 depression
 are
 more


severe.
 And
 would
 it
 surprise
 you
 that


some
 70%
 of
 Alzheimer's
 patients
 are


women?
 Why
 is
 that?
 Is
 it
 genetics?
 Is


it
 age?
 Historically,
 women
 have
 lived


longer
 than
 men.
 But
 studies
 show
 that


quote,
 "Of
 every
 three
 patients
 with


Alzheimer's,
 two
 are
 women,
 even
 after


accounting
 for
 their
 greater
 longevity


relative
 to
 men."
 And
 that
 quote,
 "Post


menopausal
 women
 account
 for
 over
 60%
 of


all
 those
 affected."
 In
 short,
 we
 are


only
 now
 learning
 the
 importance
 of


hormones
 in
 brain
 health.
 In
 a
 TED
 talk


that
 quickly
 went
 viral
 in
 2019,
 Lisa


Moscone,
 author
 of
 the
 menopause
 brain,


broke
 down
 how
 in
 menopause
 we
 usually


associate
 hot
 flashes,
 brain
 fog,


depression,
 and
 anxiety
 with
 changes
 in


our
 hormones.
 But
 she
 states
 those


changes
 are
 all
 neurological
 symptoms


and
 they
 begin
 in
 the
 brain.
 She


explained,
 "Why
 are
 our
 brains
 impacted


by
 menopause?
 Our
 brains
 and
 ovaries
 are


part
 of
 the
 neuroendocrine
 system.
 So,


the
 health
 of
 the
 ovaries
 is
 linked
 to


the
 health
 of
 the
 brain
 and
 the
 other


way
 around.
 Because
 estrogen
 is
 very


important
 to
 our
 brains,
 Alzheimer's


researchers
 are
 investigating
 whether


estrogen
 therapy
 could
 help
 to
 ward
 off


dementia
 in
 women.
 And
 since
 the
 FDA


removed
 the
 black
 box
 off
 hormone


replacement
 therapy,
 scientists
 are


hopeful
 that
 this
 will
 help
 to
 foster


more
 research.
 Canada
 recently
 approved


a
 new
 drug
 to
 treat
 Alzheimer's
 and


research
 shows
 that
 the
 shingles
 vaccine


could
 slow
 the
 progression
 of
 dementia.


On
 today's
 episode,
 we
 speak
 to


Professor
 Natasha
 Raja
 about
 how


menopause
 and
 hysterctomies
 can
 impact


her
 brain
 health
 and
 why
 menopause
 is


not
 a
 monolithic
 experience.
 We
 also


talk
 about
 the
 work
 lab
 is
 doing
 to


better
 understand
 this
 [music]
 and
 more.


Professor
 Raja
 joins
 me
 now.


Thanks
 so
 much
 for
 being
 here.
 Uh
 could


you
 please
 start
 by
 introducing
 yourself


and
 what
 you
 do?


>> Sure.
 Uh
 my
 name
 is
 Professor
 Natasha


Raja.
 I'm
 a
 full
 professor
 and
 Canada


research
 chair
 tier
 1
 in
 sex,
 gender,


and
 diversity
 at
 Toronto
 Metropolitan


University.
 And
 I
 do
 research
 the


current
 main
 research
 project
 from
 my


lab
 is
 called
 the
 brain
 health
 at


midlife
 and
 menopause
 study.
 and
 we're


interested
 in
 looking
 at
 how
 menopause


affects
 brain
 health
 and
 might
 be
 a


window
 to
 understanding
 if
 certain


females
 might
 be
 at
 risk
 for
 dementia


later
 in
 life.


>> It
 seems
 like
 we
 don't
 know
 a
 lot.
 And


um
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 learned
 this
 year


was
 that
 women
 weren't
 included
 in


clinical
 trials
 until
 1993,
 which
 is


just
 like
 I
 remember
 rap
 songs
 like
 uh


remember
 Sir
 Mix
 a
 Lot
 [laughter]


>> Baby
 Get
 Back.
 That
 song
 is
 from
 1993


and
 uh
 we're
 learning
 so
 much
 about
 the


differences
 between
 men
 and
 women.


>> When
 we
 are
 talking
 about
 brain
 health,


how
 is
 brain
 health
 different
 from
 men


compared
 to
 women?


>> So
 we're
 still
 learning
 but
 we
 do
 know


that
 developmentally
 like
 the
 body
 and


the
 brain
 are
 connected
 systems,
 right?


So
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 will


come
 about
 is
 really
 people
 studying
 the


brain
 without
 really
 considering
 how


endocrine
 function,
 physiological


function
 of
 the
 body
 will
 influence


brain
 development
 as
 well.


>> What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 that?


>> Um
 so
 how
 your
 gonatal
 and
 your
 sex


development
 will
 influence
 like
 the


hormones
 that
 are
 in
 your
 body
 and
 how


hormones
 have
 effects
 throughout
 the


body
 both
 in
 the
 body
 and
 in
 the
 brain.


And
 so
 it
 will
 lead
 to
 differentiation


and
 different
 patterns
 of
 development
 um


both
 in
 development
 and
 then
 also


potentially
 as
 we
 age.
 So
 the
 reason


historically
 people
 haven't
 really


looked
 at
 you
 know
 whether
 or
 not
 the


neural
 coralates
 of
 brain
 aging
 differ


by
 sex
 is
 because
 behaviorally
 often
 the


patterns
 are
 similar.
 So
 males
 and


females
 will
 show
 memory
 related


declines
 with
 aging
 and
 because
 the


patterns
 of
 behavior
 are
 the
 same
 people


assume
 that
 the
 underlying
 mechanisms


must
 be
 the
 same.
 But
 Something
 that
 my


lab
 started
 to
 do
 is
 challenge
 that
 and


look
 at
 whether
 or
 not
 um
 there
 are
 sex


differences
 in
 the
 underlying
 mechanisms


of
 age
 related
 memory
 decline.
 And
 what


we
 noticed
 was
 we
 were
 shocked
 because


we
 were
 using
 a
 data-driven
 method
 and


um
 we
 all
 the
 results
 pointed
 to
 sex


differences


>> and
 it
 wasn't
 something
 I
 was


anticipating.
 I'd
 been
 doing
 this


research
 in
 aging
 for
 quite
 a
 while
 um


and
 I
 never
 really
 explored
 sex
 myself


thinking
 oh
 behaviorally
 they're


similar.
 episode
 there
 probably
 isn't


any
 sex
 differences.
 But
 then
 when
 we


looked
 at
 the
 neural
 mechanisms,
 it
 was


just
 a
 wakeup
 call
 to
 me.
 It
 was
 just


wow.
 So
 in
 females,
 what
 we
 noticed
 was


a
 lot
 of
 the
 results
 that
 were
 been
 out


there
 as
 far
 as
 the
 cognitive
 aging


literature
 might
 have
 been
 driven
 by


females
 because
 females
 tend
 to


volunteer
 for
 research
 more
 than
 males


in
 the
 older
 adult
 population,
 but
 no


one
 disagregated
 the
 data
 by
 sex.
 So
 we


didn't
 know.


>> So
 everything
 was
 in
 the
 same
 pool.


>> Yeah.
 Everything
 was
 in
 the
 same
 pool.


What
 we
 noticed
 was
 only
 in
 females
 did


we
 see
 age
 related
 differences
 in


frontal
 and
 parietal
 function.
 Um
 in


males
 there
 wasn't
 any
 age
 related


differences
 and
 that
 implied
 to
 us
 that


perhaps
 females
 are
 using
 different


types
 of
 cognitive
 processes
 to
 maintain


memory
 function
 and
 to
 try
 and
 do
 the


memory
 tasks
 that
 we
 were
 challenging


them
 with.
 And
 so
 that
 really
 was
 like
 a


wakeup
 call
 saying,
 "Oh,
 so
 all
 of
 these


effects
 that
 we've
 been
 looking
 at
 in


the
 frontal
 cortex,
 are
 they
 driven
 by


females
 or
 you
 know
 what?"
 So
 we
 decided


to
 go
 in
 and
 you
 know
 deep
 dive
 into


looking
 at
 sex
 differences,
 brain
 health


equity
 in
 my
 lab
 at
 that
 point.


>> When
 I
 was
 younger,
 you
 know,
 I
 don't


think
 I
 really
 thought
 about
 my
 brain


health.
 Yeah.


>> It
 was
 more
 like,
 okay,
 how
 do
 I
 look
 on


those
 jeans?
 [laughter]


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Don't
 judge
 me.
 Um,
 but
 as
 I've
 gotten


older,
 it's
 something
 that
 I'm
 thinking


about
 a
 lot.
 Um,
 is
 it
 true
 that


approximately
 70%
 of
 those
 suffering


from
 Alzheimer's
 in
 Canada
 are
 women?


>> Yes.
 So,
 twothirds
 of
 Alzheimer's


disease
 cases
 are
 in
 females
 in
 Canada.


>> That's
 shocking.
 It's
 shocking.


>> Why
 is
 that?
 So,
 historically,
 the


assumption
 was
 that
 it's
 because
 females


live
 longer
 than
 males
 on
 average.
 and


Alzheimer's
 as
 all
 dementias
 are


diseases
 of
 aging
 and
 that's
 why
 there's


such
 a
 disproportionate
 effect.
 But
 what


a
 lot
 of
 researchers
 started
 noticing
 is


that
 in
 um
 when
 you
 look
 at
 individuals


with
 Alzheimer's
 disease,
 there's
 a
 gen


a
 genotype
 called
 the
 Apollo
 protein
 eep


epsilon
 4
 which
 puts
 you
 it's
 a
 genetic


risk
 factor
 for
 late
 onset
 Alzheimer's


disease.
 And
 what
 people
 started


noticing
 that
 there's
 a
 disproportionate


portion
 of
 females
 with
 that
 genotype


compared
 to
 males
 in
 these
 Alzheimer's


clinics.
 And
 so
 that
 pointed
 to,
 okay,


it's
 not
 just
 age.
 Perhaps
 there's


something
 about
 this
 genetic
 risk
 factor


for
 Alzheimer's
 disease
 that
 has
 a


greater
 effect
 in
 females.
 And
 then
 the


research
 started
 coming
 out
 in
 the
 '9s


and
 in
 the
 2000
 and
 is
 still
 coming
 out


right
 now
 that
 what
 does
 this
 gene
 do


differently
 in
 females
 and
 males.
 And
 in


females,
 what
 we
 know
 is
 it
 it
 leads
 to


earlier
 accumulation
 of
 some
 of
 the


neuropathologies
 associated
 with


Alzheimer's
 disease
 and
 a
 steeper


decline
 in
 females.
 So
 this
 is
 something


that
 seems
 to
 be
 female
 specific.
 This


gene
 is
 important
 for
 cholesterol


transport.
 It's
 important
 for
 vascular


health,
 is
 important
 for
 inflammation.


So
 it's,
 you
 know,
 this
 gene
 is
 a
 risk


factor
 for
 Alzheimer's
 disease,
 but
 the


mechanism
 by
 which
 it
 acts,
 you
 know,


we're
 still
 studying
 and
 we're
 still


trying
 to
 determine
 the
 details,
 but
 it


seems
 to
 interact
 with
 all
 of
 these


health
 factors
 that
 are
 modifiable
 as


well
 at
 midlife.
 So
 that's
 why
 it's
 a


really
 interesting
 result.
 Um
 it
 I
 think


it
 also
 shows
 the
 importance
 of
 studying


uh
 with
 different
 sexes.


>> Yes.
 Exactly.


>> Because
 if
 it's
 impacting
 majority
 women


and
 you're
 not
 studying
 it
 that
 way


>> Exactly.


>> then
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 gaps
 that
 fall.


>> Exactly.
 And
 so
 like
 historically
 people


just
 did
 not
 consider
 how
 biological
 sex


might
 be
 and
 gender
 related
 you
 know


factors
 such
 as
 social
 determinance
 of


health
 which
 are
 also
 very
 gendered.
 um


how
 they
 might
 interact
 with
 our
 biology


and
 contribute
 to
 different
 profiles
 of


risk
 and
 outcomes.
 And
 so
 with
 in
 the


case
 of
 Alzheimer's
 disease,
 exactly
 the


assumption
 was
 oh
 females
 are
 living


longer
 and
 that's
 why.
 And
 then
 these


kind
 of
 other
 findings
 were
 popping
 up


and
 then
 people
 decided
 yes
 it's
 time
 to


look
 at
 sex
 differences
 like
 we
 can't


really
 hide
 this.
 There
 was
 a
 lot
 of


strong
 advocates
 for
 it
 and
 people


started
 listening
 but
 it
 takes
 advocacy


and
 it
 takes
 you
 know
 the
 scientist
 that


wants
 to
 ask
 the
 question.


>> What
 roles
 do
 hormones
 play
 in
 brain


function?


>> Hormones
 play
 a
 huge
 role
 in
 body
 and


brain
 function.
 And
 so
 we
 know
 that


within
 the
 brain
 there's
 multiple


different
 types
 of
 estrogens.
 So


estrogen
 is
 not
 a
 single
 chemical.


There's
 many
 types
 and
 they
 have


different


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 different
 factors
 and


different
 ways
 in
 which
 they
 function
 in


the
 brain.
 And
 the
 primary
 one
 that
 most


of
 us
 study
 are
 interested
 in
 is


estradiol
 17
 beta
 or
 E2.
 Um,
 and
 that


type
 of
 estrogen
 has
 receptors
 in
 the


brain
 in
 two
 key
 brain
 areas
 important


for
 memory
 and
 cognition.
 The


hippocampus,
 which
 is
 a
 critical
 area
 of


the
 brain
 from
 memory.
 So
 damage
 to
 the


hippocampus
 leads
 to
 amnesia.
 Some
 of


you
 might
 have
 heard
 of
 a
 scientist


named
 Brenda
 Milner.
 So
 she
 did
 a
 lot
 of


research
 on
 this
 patient
 HM
 who
 had


damage
 to
 the
 hippocampus
 and
 he
 could


not
 learn
 new
 information
 and
 he
 had


really
 poor
 memory.
 Um
 and
 so
 the
 hippoc


campus
 is
 a
 key
 uh
 part
 of
 the
 brain
 for


learning
 new
 things
 and
 remembering


things.
 And
 then
 the
 prefrontal
 cortex


which
 is
 very
 important
 for
 organizing


behavior,
 predicting
 the
 future,


perspective,
 planning
 um
 our
 sense
 of


self,
 things
 like
 that.
 So
 it's
 very


important
 for
 what
 neuroscientists
 will


call
 cognitive
 control.


>> And
 so
 here
 are
 two
 brain
 regions
 that


are
 really
 enriched
 for
 estrogen


receptors.
 And
 so
 and
 they're
 really


important
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 types
 of


cognitive
 behaviors
 as
 well.
 So
 when


there's
 estrogen
 related
 fluctuations,


you
 could
 imagine
 how
 the
 way
 that
 these


regions
 function
 and
 communicate
 with


other
 areas
 of
 the
 brain
 because
 the


brain
 is
 a
 large
 scale
 neural
 network.


>> Um
 it
 has
 profound
 effects
 across
 many


different
 behavioral
 domains.
 I
 when
 I


was
 going
 through
 my
 health
 issues,
 I


kept
 hearing
 from
 friends,
 oh,
 it
 could


be
 parameopause
 and
 something
 that
 comes


up
 a
 lot.
 Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


confusion
 about
 parameopause
 and


menopause.
 They're
 two
 different
 things.


>> They're
 different
 stages.


>> Can
 you
 explain
 to
 us?


>> Sure.
 So,
 in
 midlife,
 most
 of
 us
 enter


midlife
 and
 we're
 premenopausal.
 I
 say


most
 of
 us
 because
 some
 people
 do
 enter


pmenopause
 in
 their
 30s,


>> as
 early
 as
 35,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Some
 people
 menopause
 before
 the


age
 of
 40,
 right?
 So,
 but
 on
 average,


spontaneous
 menopause,
 if
 you
 have


ovaries,
 occurs
 in
 Canada
 on
 the
 at
 the


average
 age
 of
 51.
 And
 so,
 you're


premenopausal,
 meaning
 you're
 having


regular
 cycles.
 You're
 still,
 you
 know,


reproductively
 fertile.
 Um,
 and
 you


still
 have
 like
 the
 menstrual
 cycle,


like
 the
 lutil
 phase,
 the
 follicular


phase.
 It's
 very
 stable
 and
 it
 happens.


And
 then


>> things
 start
 to
 change
 in
 your
 body.


Your
 ovaries,
 you
 know,
 your
 eggs
 are


getting
 fewer.
 your
 estrogen
 starts
 to


increase
 and
 kind
 of
 fluctuate.
 And
 so


it
 is
 fluctuating
 during
 pmenopause,
 but


it
 is
 on
 the
 slow
 decline.


>> So
 it's
 jumping
 around,
 but
 it's
 slowly


declining.
 Um,
 and
 so
 pmenopause
 is
 a


time
 where
 females
 might
 experience


night
 sweats,
 difficulties
 in
 sleeping,


um,
 start
 to
 have
 urinary
 tract


infections,
 have,
 you
 know,
 dryness
 down


there,


>> itchy
 ears.


>> Itchy
 ears,
 itchy
 frozen
 shoulder.


>> Yeah.
 Frozen
 shoulder.
 all
 sorts
 of


interesting
 um
 side
 effects
 of
 this


natural
 phase
 in
 human
 aging
 like
 female


aging.
 I
 do
 like
 to
 like
 highlight
 that


it
 is
 a
 natural
 process
 but
 some
 females


do
 experience
 um
 you
 know
 60%
 of
 females


report
 having
 brain
 fog
 and
 memory


complaints
 and
 so
 it
 is
 a
 phase
 of
 a
 lot


of
 change.
 You
 know,
 your
 body
 is
 really


rewiring
 its
 system
 like
 your
 body
 and


brain
 is
 rewiring
 as
 there's
 this
 slow


decline
 in
 a
 primary
 sex
 hormone
 in
 the


female
 body


>> and
 then
 eventually
 it
 declines
 to
 the


point
 that
 it's
 un
 not
 even
 measurable


by
 like
 traditional
 techniques
 that
 we


use
 in
 the
 lab
 called
 Eliza


>> and
 you
 and
 you
 stop
 having
 periods


altogether.
 You
 no
 longer
 are
 releasing


eggs.
 you're
 no
 longer
 reproductively,


you
 know,


healthy,
 I
 guess,
 or
 I
 don't
 like
 to
 use


the
 word
 healthy,
 but
 reproductively


fit,
 right?
 So,
 and
 you
 enter
 menopause.


So,
 menopause
 is
 technically
 defined


medically
 as
 one
 year
 of
 no,
 you
 know,


no
 cycling.
 Um,
 so
 if
 you're
 spotting


after
 menopause,
 it's
 often
 important


you
 go
 visit
 your
 doctor
 because
 it's


not
 a
 n
 that's
 not
 a
 natural
 part
 of


menopause
 to
 spot
 after
 you
 menopaused.


>> But
 you
 do
 spot,


>> you
 know,
 here
 and
 there
 until
 you
 reach


menopause
 and
 then
 it's
 one
 year
 of
 no


cycling,
 no
 spotting,
 no
 periods


>> and
 that's
 menopause.


>> That's
 menopause.
 Up
 to
 that
 point,


you're
 permenopausal.
 Thank
 you
 for


explaining
 that
 because
 I
 think
 uh
 we're


using
 we're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 um


>> things
 online
 where
 it's
 the
 same
 thing


and
 it's
 two
 different
 things.


>> It's
 two
 different
 things.


>> Parmenopause
 can
 last
 10
 years
 and
 uh


this
 you
 know
 um
 circus
 of
 horrors


[laughter]


>> that
 goes
 on.
 But
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that


uh
 people
 always
 say
 uh
 when
 you're


going
 through
 the
 change
 is
 uh
 the
 night


sweats
 and
 uh
 the
 brain
 fog
 and
 it's
 got


like
 cute
 words
 but
 it's
 actually
 quite


scary
 when
 you
 are
 in
 the
 prime
 of
 your


life
 and
 you
 your
 brain
 is
 not
 working


uh
 the
 way
 and
 I
 I
 should
 also
 mention


that
 studies
 do
 show
 that
 even
 though


we're
 going
 through
 parmenopause
 and


have
 brain
 fog
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 that


women
 are
 less
 capable
 in
 the
 workplace.


>> No,
 not
 at
 all.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 also


leads
 to
 people
 not
 talking
 about
 it


because
 you
 also
 don't
 want
 people
 to


think
 like
 you're
 not
 as
 capable
 as
 you


used
 to
 be.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 an
 important
 point.


I
 think
 historically
 there's
 been
 a


hesitance
 to
 talk
 about
 women's
 health


because
 of
 this
 concern
 about
 how
 we
 are


perceived
 and
 how
 we
 will
 be
 treated


because
 the
 history
 of
 womanhood
 on
 you


know
 in
 society
 and
 so
 we've
 been


hesitant
 to
 talk
 about
 it


>> but
 aging
 is
 related
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 things


as
 well
 and
 I
 always
 like
 to
 frame


menopause
 within
 the
 context
 of
 healthy


aging
 because
 we're
 all
 aging
 males
 and


females
 and
 you
 know
 there
 are


differences
 in
 our
 cognition
 as
 we
 age


and
 in
 our
 bodies
 as
 we
 age
 and
 we
 study


that
 because
 we
 want
 to
 optimize
 our


aging
 and
 make
 sure
 people
 age
 as
 well


as
 possible.
 So
 why
 not
 do
 the
 same
 with


menopause?
 Like
 we
 just
 we
 need
 to


optimize
 how
 females
 experience
 this


very
 natural
 part
 of
 endocrinological


aging,
 right?


>> Well,
 explain
 to
 us
 how
 it
 works
 because


um
 as
 we've
 been
 talking
 about


[clears throat]
 estrogen
 tends
 to


fluctuate
 throughout
 a
 woman's
 life,


>> but
 never
 more
 so,
 I
 guess,
 during


menopause.


>> What
 happens
 to
 a
 woman's
 brain
 at
 this


time?


>> So,
 we're
 just
 starting
 to
 understand


what's
 happening
 to
 the
 women's
 brain


during
 menopause
 transition.
 Um
 and


that's
 the
 primary
 focus
 of
 what
 the
 the


research
 in
 my
 lab
 is
 um
 doing.
 And


there's
 two
 things
 that
 we're
 trying
 to


address.
 So
 first
 there's
 a
 big
 debate


of
 whether
 or
 not
 some
 of
 these
 changes


that
 females
 experience
 subjectively
 can


we
 objectively
 you
 know
 valid
 like
 yes


this
 is
 true
 you
 are
 experiencing
 memory


decline.
 Like
 it's
 not
 because
 a
 lot
 of


times
 females
 will
 go
 to
 the
 doctor
 and


they'll
 be
 told
 it's
 just
 you
 know
 it's


that's
 fine.
 Like
 it's
 just
 subjective.


you're
 not
 really
 showing
 any
 decline.


And
 many
 tests
 are
 insensitive
 to


showing
 an
 objective
 measure.
 And
 so
 one


of
 the
 things
 that
 my
 um
 lab
 designed


was
 a
 memory
 task
 that
 really
 does


objectively
 show
 that
 at
 menopause
 there


is
 an
 age
 related
 decline.
 So
 we
 use


this
 task
 called
 a
 spatial
 context


memory
 task.
 It's
 very
 like
 scient,
 you


know,
 something
 you
 do
 in
 a
 lab.
 Um
 but


it's
 something
 we
 actually
 do
 in
 real


life
 as
 well.
 So
 we
 ask
 people
 to


memorize
 faces
 and
 the
 place
 they
 are
 on


a
 screen.
 And
 it's
 something
 you
 do


dayto-day.
 you
 park
 your
 car,
 where
 is


it
 in
 the
 parking
 lot?


>> I
 forget
 every
 day.


>> Exactly.
 I
 took
 a
 photo
 now,
 right?
 Just


to
 [laughter]
 know
 exactly
 where
 it
 is.


But,
 you
 know,
 so
 we
 test
 this
 uh


ability,
 the
 me
 the
 ability
 to
 memorize


a
 face
 and
 its
 facial
 location.
 What
 we


notice
 is
 this
 type
 of
 task
 which
 is
 a


very
 challenging
 task
 is
 sensitive


enough
 to
 validate
 that
 yes,
 objectively


females
 at
 menopause
 show
 an
 age-


related
 decline
 on
 average.
 And
 I
 always


like
 to
 like
 stress
 the
 on
 average


because
 not
 all
 females
 show
 this


decline
 and
 the
 level
 of
 decline
 varies


across
 females.
 And
 so
 what
 we're
 trying


to
 understand
 is
 what
 accounts
 for
 that


variation.
 Is
 it
 their
 vascular
 health?


Is
 it
 inflammatory
 biomarkers
 in
 their


blood?
 Is
 it
 having
 genetic
 risk
 factors


for
 Alzheimer's
 disease?
 And
 then
 what


we
 need
 to
 follow
 up
 with
 is
 is
 it


transient
 or
 is
 it
 something
 that
 is


chronic?
 And
 [clears throat]
 we
 hope


that
 for
 the
 mo
 vast
 majority
 of
 females


it
 is
 something
 transient
 right
 as
 the


system
 is
 neuro
 you
 know
 pla
 the


plasticity
 of
 the
 system
 during
 this


transition
 it's
 rewiring
 itself
 and
 as


it
 adjusts


things
 will
 kind
 of
 get
 better
 and
 we


might
 even
 adopt
 new
 ways
 of
 being
 that


are
 healthier
 in
 the
 long
 term
 as
 we


age.
 Um,
 but
 for
 some
 females
 it
 might


not
 be
 transient.
 It
 might
 be
 chronic.


And
 they
 might
 be
 the
 females
 that


really
 need
 intervention
 and
 attention


to
 kind
 of
 promote
 healthy
 aging
 and


prevent
 or
 delay
 the
 onset
 of
 dementia.


That's
 what
 the
 research
 is
 focused
 on.


>> Something
 I've
 been
 seeing
 a
 lot
 online


is
 that
 um
 when
 women
 get
 to
 a
 certain


age,
 they
 stop
 doing,
 you
 know,
 the


people
 pleasing,
 which
 I
 am
 very
 much


looking
 forward
 to.
 [laughter]


But
 um
 you
 know
 a
 surgery
 that
 seems
 to


be
 the
 go-to
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 females
 who


are
 experiencing
 gynecology
 illnesses


like
 fibroids
 is
 hysterctomy.
 Hyerectomy


is
 the
 second
 most
 common
 surgery
 for


women
 behind
 a
 C-section.
 Um
 but
 I


recently
 found
 out
 that
 getting
 a


hyctomy
 depending
 on
 your
 age
 if
 you're


too
 young
 can
 actually
 increase
 the


likelihood
 for
 women
 developing


Alzheimer's
 later
 in
 life.
 Why
 is
 that?


And
 why
 aren't
 we
 talking
 more
 about


that?


>> Sure.


>> Because
 what
 the


>> Yeah.
 And
 you
 know
 I
 I
 too
 was
 offered


hysterctomy
 because
 of
 fibroids
 and


opted
 not
 to
 get
 it
 um
 for
 these


reasons.
 Um
 and
 so
 and
 it
 always
 depends


on
 how
 extreme
 your
 fibroids
 are
 and
 how


much
 it's
 affecting
 your
 quality
 of
 life


uh
 your
 decision.
 But
 it's
 because
 the


blood
 supply
 to
 the
 ovaries
 are
 altered.


So
 you're,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 do
 get
 a


hyctomy,
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 conversation


with
 your
 doctor
 about
 keeping
 your


ovaries
 if
 possible,
 just
 because
 they


are
 the
 primary
 source
 of
 your,
 you


know,
 um,
 peripheral
 estrogens.
 And
 if


it's
 not
 possible,
 then
 you
 do
 need
 to


have
 a
 conversation
 with
 your
 doctor


about
 the
 options
 of
 doing
 menopause


hormone
 therapy
 to
 pre
 to
 kind
 of


mitigate
 the
 loss
 of
 estrogen
 suddenly


after
 a
 newertomy.
 But
 if
 you
 even
 if


you
 do
 keep
 your
 ovaries,
 the
 blood


supply
 to
 the
 ovaries


>> can
 be
 altered.
 It
 really
 depends
 on
 the


surgeon,
 right?
 Like
 it's
 it's
 there
 are


surgeons
 that
 are
 better
 at
 surgery
 and


others
 that
 aren't.
 And
 sometimes
 they


do
 nip
 some
 blood
 supply
 and
 sometimes


there
 is
 a
 lack
 of
 blood
 supply
 to
 the


ovaries
 which
 will
 lead
 to
 it
 not


functioning
 optimally.
 And
 so
 that's
 why


um
 some
 females
 that
 you
 know
 even
 if


they
 maintain
 their
 ovaries
 and
 u
 have


their
 hysterctomy
 um
 their
 uterus


removed
 may
 still
 show
 some
 cognitive


decline
 with
 aging
 especially
 if
 they're


not
 treated
 appropriately
 with
 hormone


replacement
 therapy.


>> And
 so
 that's
 how
 it's
 related
 to
 the


brain
 health.
 Yes.
 Because
 of
 the


estrogen.


>> Yes.
 Exactly.


>> Um
 my
 health
 went
 downhill
 uh
 after
 I


got
 COVID
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 And
 again


it
 was
 kind
 of
 like
 what's
 going
 on?
 Do


I
 have
 pmenopause?
 Is
 it
 long
 COVID?
 Um,


and
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 girlfriends
 were
 having


similar
 conversations
 and
 talking
 about


the
 brain
 fog,
 uh,
 which
 can
 be
 a
 side


effect
 of
 long
 COVID
 or
 pmenopause.
 And


now
 we're
 seeing
 more
 studies
 that
 show


that
 women
 are
 actually
 more
 likely
 to


be
 impacted
 by
 long
 COVID.
 Do
 we
 know


why
 that
 is?


>> No,
 we
 do
 not
 know
 why
 that
 is.
 And
 that


needs
 to
 be
 studied.
 There
 are
 many


mechanisms
 that
 are
 potential
 like


vascular
 health
 and
 inflammation


especially
 if
 you're
 going
 through


pmenopause
 and
 menopause
 during
 that


time
 because
 the
 decrease
 in
 estrogen


does
 relate
 to
 an
 increase
 in
 vascular


risk
 and
 an
 incre
 and
 an
 increase
 in


inflammatory
 response
 or
 immune


reactivity.
 Um
 so
 there
 are
 if
 you're


going
 through
 pmenopause
 and
 there's
 you


know
 a
 disease
 that
 affects
 the


inflammatory
 system
 like
 CO
 does
 um
 you


might
 have
 this
 double
 kind
 of
 hit
 but


we
 need
 to
 like
 this
 is
 ongoing
 research


and
 I
 am
 not
 a
 specialist
 in
 COVID.
 So
 I


would
 not
 want
 to
 say
 something
 that
 you


know
 may
 not
 translate
 or
 may
 not
 hold


up
 in
 the
 long
 run.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 I
 want
 to
 uh
 talk
 again
 about


parmenopause
 and
 menopause.
 According
 to


reporting
 from
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 women


of
 of
 color
 experience
 pmenopause


differently.
 Black
 women
 experience
 it


earlier
 and
 more
 severely.


Asian-American
 women
 women
 uh
 a
 group


that
 includes
 women
 who
 are
 of
 Chinese,


Korean,
 South
 Asian,
 and
 Filipino


backgrounds.
 Uh
 studies
 have
 found
 that


they
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 experience


chronic
 pain
 and
 anxiety
 as
 opposed
 to


hot
 flashes.
 Um
 why
 is
 it
 important
 to


recognize
 that
 pmenopause
 menopause


impacts
 different
 populations


differently?
 because
 the
 treatments
 that


you
 offer
 are
 different
 and
 also
 the


health
 the
 lifestyle
 approaches
 might


differ
 for
 these
 different
 communities.


All
 females
 around
 the
 world
 who
 have


ovaries
 experience
 menopause.
 And
 we


need
 to
 understand
 the
 experiences


within
 the
 context
 of
 these
 cultures


because
 we
 don't
 know
 how
 much
 is


related
 to
 physiology
 and
 actual,
 you


know,
 cultural
 differences
 in


physiology,
 uh,
 cultural
 differences
 in


communication
 style,
 cultural


differences
 in
 the
 language
 that
 is


used.


>> You
 know,
 certain
 cultures
 might
 not


even
 have
 the
 words
 for
 hot
 flashes.


>> Right.


>> Right.
 And
 so
 they
 may
 not
 use
 that


term,
 but
 it's
 because
 and
 so
 we
 might


not
 think
 they
 have
 hot
 flashes,
 but


they
 might.
 They
 just
 might
 use
 a


different
 term.
 So
 we
 really
 need
 to


understand
 um
 how
 menopause
 is


experienced
 across
 the
 world
 and
 also


what
 the
 average
 age
 of
 menopause
 is


across
 the
 world
 because
 another
 thing


that
 um
 you
 hear
 a
 lot
 of
 is
 how
 you


know
 the
 age
 of
 menopause
 matters
 and
 a


younger
 age
 of
 menopause
 might
 be
 a
 risk


factor
 for
 poorer
 health
 outcomes
 as
 we


age.
 But
 we
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 true


for
 all
 females
 in
 all
 communities.
 That


that
 is
 based
 on
 western
 standards
 and


results
 that
 have
 happened
 in
 studies


that
 have
 not
 represented
 um
 more


diverse
 populations.
 The
 average
 age
 of


menopause
 in
 India
 is
 47
 right
 46
 47.
 So


and
 that
 means
 the
 average
 that
 means


females
 are
 entering
 menopause
 on


average
 younger
 as
 well.
 Um,


does
 that
 mean
 that
 Indian
 women
 are


more
 likely
 to
 have
 poorer
 health


outcomes
 as
 we
 age?
 I
 don't
 know.
 We


have
 to
 study
 that.
 Same
 the
 average
 age


in
 African-Americans
 is
 a
 bit
 younger


like
 48
 I
 believe.


>> Um,
 so
 what
 is
 that?
 you
 know,
 how
 does


that
 translate
 these
 concepts
 of
 average


age
 and
 early
 onset
 of
 menopause
 being


poor
 health
 outcomes
 and
 how
 do
 we


disentangle
 menopause
 right
 which
 is
 um


a
 biological
 phenomena
 from
 the
 context


in
 which
 these
 fe
 females
 were
 born
 and


raised.
 So
 the
 social
 determinance
 of


health
 because
 the
 social
 determinance


of
 health
 are
 the
 biggest
 modifiable


factors
 for
 preventing
 dementia,


delaying
 dementia
 and
 for
 aging
 well
 and


for
 health
 in
 general,
 optimizing
 health


in
 general.
 Um
 and
 so
 we
 know
 that
 but


you
 know
 to
 implement
 changes
 in
 social


determinance
 of
 health
 it
 really
 is
 a


policy
 you
 know
 these
 are
 policies
 that


need
 to
 be
 adopted
 at
 a
 governmental


level
 and
 you
 know
 to
 help
 people
 age


better
 and


>> by
 age
 I
 mean
 not
 just
 older
 age
 I
 mean


age
 like
 this
 you're
 developing
 and
 then


you're
 aging
 and
 we
 need
 to
 start


thinking
 of
 aging
 as
 a
 life
 course


>> um
 as
 well.
 We're
 aging
 from
 the
 time


we're
 young
 adults.


>> My
 daughter
 my
 daughter
 says
 we're
 born


to
 die.


>> Yes.
 I'm
 like,
 you're
 too
 wise
 for
 to
 be


12
 years
 old.
 And
 I
 guess
 also
 too,
 the


dangers
 if
 you
 have
 this
 idea
 of
 the
 age


of
 when
 uh
 females
 are
 supposed
 to
 go


through
 menopause
 is
 if
 you're
 younger


>> and
 if
 you
 are
 from
 a
 culture,
 a


background
 that
 might
 go
 through
 it


younger,
 if
 you
 go
 to
 get
 help,
 they


might
 dismiss
 your
 symptoms
 as
 being


nothing
 to
 worry
 about.
 You
 mentioned


the
 social
 determinants
 of
 health.


>> What
 role
 do
 they
 play
 when
 it
 comes
 to


our
 brain
 health?
 because
 I
 don't
 think


um
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 realize
 how
 we
 live


or
 where
 we
 live
 can
 impact
 how
 we
 age.


>> Yeah.
 So
 this
 concept
 in
 cognitive


aation
 called
 cognitive
 reserve.
 It


comes
 from
 the
 literature
 in
 dementia


where
 we
 observed
 that
 there
 are
 some


individuals
 as
 they
 age
 they
 seem
 to


maintain
 their
 cognitive
 health
 later
 in


life
 but
 then
 once
 they
 are
 diagnosed


with
 dementia
 they
 show
 a
 steeper


decline.
 And
 so
 individuals
 started


looking
 at
 their
 brains
 using
 PET


imaging
 and
 then
 autopsy.
 And
 what
 we


noticed
 was
 these
 individuals
 actually


had
 more
 neuropathology
 in
 their
 brain


when
 they
 hit
 di
 when
 they
 got
 diagnosed


but
 were
 able
 to
 maintain
 their


cognitive
 function
 despite
 the
 presence


of
 these
 neuropathologies.
 And
 so
 this


implied
 to
 us
 that
 you
 know
 there
 is


this
 ability
 in
 h
 in
 the
 human
 brain
 to


kind
 of
 compensate
 and
 make
 up
 for
 these


this
 damage
 that's
 accumulating
 in
 the


brain.
 And
 this
 concept
 is
 cognitive


reserve.
 And
 so
 cognitive
 reserve
 is


related
 to
 social
 determinance
 of


health.
 So
 we
 know
 that
 higher
 education


you
 know
 leads
 to
 more
 cognitive


reserve.
 People
 that
 have
 a
 more
 more


educated
 tend
 to
 age
 well
 and
 maintain


cognitive
 function
 longer.
 Um
 we
 know


that
 eating
 healthy
 having
 a
 good


lifestyle
 and
 maintaining
 you
 know
 um


lower
 body
 mass
 like
 lower
 hip
 to
 waist


ratio
 is
 good
 for
 aging
 as
 well.
 So
 we


know
 these
 kind
 of
 cognitive
 reserve


variables
 are
 good
 living
 in
 an
 area


that's
 not
 polluted.
 It
 has
 a
 lot
 of


green
 spaces.
 We
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


research
 coming
 out
 that
 these
 social


determs
 of
 health
 help
 bolster
 cognitive


reserve
 and
 help
 maintain
 healthy
 aging


for
 individuals.
 And
 so
 we're
 starting


to
 kind
 of
 tease
 apart
 how
 does
 this


relate
 to
 different
 communities
 around


the
 world?
 Is
 it
 just
 in
 North
 America


things
 like
 you
 know
 and
 in
 Europe?
 So


we're
 starting
 to
 understand
 that
 but
 in


general
 there
 is
 this
 concept
 of
 social


determinance
 of
 health
 and
 its


relationship
 to
 cognitive
 reserve
 and


brain
 resilience.
 And
 so
 this
 is


something
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 studied
 um
 to


identify
 what
 social
 determs
 of
 health


are
 the
 most
 impactful.
 So
 you
 know


education
 policies
 is
 that
 where
 we


should
 be
 putting
 money
 as
 a
 government


as
 a
 country
 to
 you
 know
 to
 make


education
 more
 accessible
 and
 less


costly
 for
 people
 because
 it
 really
 does


help
 people
 as
 they
 age
 as
 well.
 So


things
 like
 that,
 that's
 what
 social


determines
 why
 they're
 important.


>> I've
 also
 heard
 like
 even
 racism
 can


play
 a
 role
 in
 your
 brain
 health.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 that's
 like
 there's
 social


determinance
 of
 health
 and
 then


structural
 determinance
 of
 health
 where


systems
 are
 built
 to
 kind
 of
 uh
 support


certain
 communities
 and
 hinder
 other


communities
 and
 then
 the
 structural


effects
 of
 that.
 So
 the
 racism
 that
 you


see
 in
 society,
 the
 stress.
 So
 stress
 is


an
 interesting
 thing
 because
 it's
 a


biological
 phenomena
 like
 it's
 how
 you


experience
 the
 world
 and
 then
 how
 it


translates
 into
 your
 body.


>> And
 stress
 itself
 is
 not
 a
 social


determinant
 of
 health
 but
 it
 probably
 is


one
 of
 the
 major
 mechanisms
 by
 which
 you


know
 having
 poor
 social
 determs
 of


health.
 So
 living
 in
 poverty,
 not
 having


good
 access
 to
 high
 quality
 foods,
 not


um
 you
 know
 being
 able
 to
 sleep
 well
 at


night
 because
 it's
 noisy
 out
 or
 you're


scared
 um
 for
 your
 safety,
 things
 like


that.
 All
 of
 these
 things
 accumulate


stress
 in
 your
 body
 and
 that
 will
 have


negative
 outcomes
 on
 brain
 health
 and


aging
 starting
 from
 young
 adulthood
 and


mental
 health.


>> Um
 because
 even
 we
 know
 that
 groceries


are
 very
 expensive.


>> Uh
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 food
 deserts.
 Um


some
 people
 just
 don't
 have
 if
 you're


>> living
 in
 uh
 an
 environment
 where
 you


don't
 have
 access
 to
 that.
 It's
 pretty


much,
 it
 seems
 as
 if
 you're,
 when
 you


think
 about
 how
 you're
 getting
 older,


how
 you're
 aging,
 it's
 already


determined
 how
 your
 brain
 health
 is


going
 to
 be
 when
 you
 get
 old.
 It
 just


seems
 so
 unfair.


>> It's
 unfair.
 And,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 why


in
 some
 ways
 people
 are
 like,
 well,
 you


need
 to
 exercise.
 You
 need
 to
 eat
 well.


And
 it's
 a
 very,
 it's
 coming
 from
 a


place
 of
 privilege
 to
 say
 that
 because


not
 any
 everyone
 can
 afford
 to
 take
 the


time
 to
 exercise.
 Not
 everyone
 has
 the


money
 in
 their
 bank
 to
 eat
 healthy.
 Um


so
 really
 um
 we
 we
 as
 researchers
 can


come
 up
 with
 this
 is
 the
 ideal
 lifestyle


like
 the
 Mediterranean
 diet
 getting


cardiovascular
 training
 doing
 strength


training
 um
 but
 the
 ultimate
 question
 is


how
 do
 we
 make
 society
 more
 equitable
 so


everyone
 can
 access
 these
 things


>> um
 because
 if
 we
 we
 might
 know
 the


solutions
 but
 then
 to
 enact
 them
 into


policy
 that
 goes
 beyond
 the
 researcher


right
 that's
 the
 research
 what
 we
 do
 as


researchers
 is
 we
 find
 these
 results


then
 we
 communicate
 ate
 to
 the
 public


and
 then
 some
 of
 us
 will,
 you
 know,


become
 advocates
 or
 go
 that
 advocacy


route
 to
 really
 push
 for
 policy
 change


um
 to
 integrate
 what
 we
 know
 from


research.
 But
 that
 needs
 to
 happen
 for


that
 translation.
 If
 that
 if
 that


doesn't
 happen,
 it
 doesn't
 translate
 and


we
 we
 might
 sit
 on
 a
 you
 know
 mountain


of
 knowledge
 that
 cannot
 actually


implemented
 because
 that's
 beyond
 our


power.


>> I
 wanted
 to
 uh
 talk
 about
 solutions
 and


a
 way
 forward.
 You've
 mentioned
 policy.


What
 should
 our
 governments
 be
 doing
 to


support
 women's
 brain
 health?


>> Invest
 in
 it.
 Like
 they're
 really
 Canada


is
 not
 investing
 in
 women's
 brain
 health


at
 this
 moment.
 Like
 there
 are
 there
 are


researchers
 like
 myself
 who
 are
 funded


and
 well
 funded
 by
 triil
 uh
 grants
 that


are
 um
 so
 there's
 ner
 sh
 and
 c.
 They're


the
 three
 major
 funding
 bodies
 in


Canada.
 um
 they
 have
 not
 had
 a
 a


significant
 increase
 in
 funding
 from
 the


federal
 government
 for
 many
 many
 years.


Um
 and
 the
 cost
 of
 doing
 research
 has


increased.
 So
 in
 some
 ways
 by
 not


increasing
 funding
 to
 these
 funding


agencies,
 you're
 actually
 hurting


researchers,
 you're
 actually
 reducing


the
 amount
 of
 funding
 available
 because


the
 cost
 of
 research
 has
 gone
 up.
 We're


all
 encouraged
 to
 pay
 our
 students


>> a
 living
 wage.
 Right.


>> Right.
 We're
 encouraged
 to
 pay
 our
 staff


a
 living
 wage.
 That
 living
 wage
 is


increasing
 as
 we
 all
 know.
 And
 so
 and
 as


researchers,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 um


we
 want
 to
 take
 care
 of
 our
 staff
 and


our
 students,


>> but
 that
 money
 then
 is
 going
 away
 from


the
 research.


>> Exactly.
 And
 then
 the
 cost
 of
 actually


like
 purchasing
 the
 equipment,
 um


purchasing,
 you
 know,
 doing
 the
 tests


that
 we
 need
 to
 do
 to
 do
 our
 research.


Those
 costs
 are
 going
 up,
 too.


Everything's
 going
 up,
 but
 our
 funding


line
 has
 not.


>> And
 so
 this
 really
 hurts
 research
 in


general
 in
 Canada.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you


know,
 people
 see
 women's
 health
 research


as
 a
 niche
 thing
 and
 that
 needs
 to


change.
 It's
 not
 a
 niche
 thing.
 Women's


health
 is
 health
 for
 all
 because
 by


studying
 women,
 we
 actually
 learn
 a
 lot


about
 men
 as
 well
 and
 what
 works
 for


women
 and
 what
 works
 for
 men.
 And
 if
 we


we
 always
 hear
 about
 precision
 medicine


and
 using
 AI
 tools.
 Well,
 AI
 only
 works


if
 you
 have
 the
 base
 data
 to,
 you
 know,


develop
 the
 AI
 tools.
 But
 we
 don't
 have


the
 data
 on
 women
 and
 we
 don't
 have
 the


data
 on
 diverse
 populations.
 So
 in
 order


to
 really
 get
 to
 a
 precision
 health
 in


our
 in
 our
 society,
 which
 is
 what


everyone
 wants,


>> we
 need
 to
 study
 women
 and
 then
 we
 need


to
 study
 the
 intersectional
 identities


of
 people
 as
 well.


>> And
 hello,
 we
 make
 up
 50%
 of
 the


population.


>> Exactly.
 And
 you
 know,
 we
 need
 and
 the


what
 most
 researchers
 can
 do
 is
 recruit


women
 into
 your
 studies
 if
 you're
 doing


human
 subject
 studying.
 And
 if
 you're


doing
 animal
 studies,
 test
 female


animals
 as
 well
 and
 disagregate
 your


data.
 Like
 we
 we
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have


the
 data.
 They
 just
 haven't
 looked
 at
 it


through
 a
 sex
 and
 gender
 based
 analysis


lens.


>> Well,
 what
 can
 individuals
 do
 for
 to


protect
 their
 own
 health
 because
 systems


uh
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 we're
 all


exhausted.
 We're
 all
 just
 trying
 to
 do


the
 best
 that
 we
 can.
 what
 can


individuals
 do
 to
 um
 make
 sure
 that
 when


they
 do
 get
 to
 a
 certain
 age
 because
 a


lot
 of
 our
 brain
 health
 the
 diseases


don't
 just
 happen


>> no


>> they
 take
 decades
 to
 develop
 right


>> exactly
 and
 so
 there
 are
 many
 things


that
 you
 could
 do
 starting
 at
 a
 like


young
 adulthood
 like
 you
 know
 I
 don't


you
 know
 trying
 to
 your
 best
 to
 adopt
 a


healthy
 lifestyle
 one
 thing
 you
 can
 do


is
 quit
 smoking
 like
 that's
 a
 modifiable


risk
 factor
 that
 will
 save
 you
 money


right
 so
 smoking
 is
 we
 know
 that
 that's


one
 of
 the
 biggest
 risk
 factors
 for
 late


life
 dementia
 and
 it's
 modifiable
 and
 so


you
 could
 quit
 smoking.
 Uh
 you
 could


reduce
 your
 alcohol
 intake
 again
 saving


some
 money.
 Um
 but
 we
 do
 know
 that
 you


know
 high
 levels
 of
 alcohol
 intake
 is


detrimental
 to
 aging.
 So
 there
 are


things
 you
 could
 do
 that
 will
 actually


save
 you
 money.
 Um
 so
 you
 know
 quit


smoking,
 quit
 drinking,
 um
 not
 quit
 but


like
 reduce
 the
 amount.
 Uh,
 and
 you


could
 also
 like
 prioritize
 sleep.
 So,


sleep
 is
 doesn't
 cost
 you
 anything.


>> But
 if
 you
 have
 night
 flashes,
 you
 can't


sleep.
 [laughter]


>> I
 know,
 I
 know,
 I
 know.
 But
 prioritizing


sleep.
 There
 are
 new
 medications
 on
 the


market
 that
 are
 purely
 for
 hot
 flashes.


I'm
 not
 an
 advocate.
 I
 am
 not
 paid
 by


the
 drug
 companies
 or
 anything.
 I'm


curious
 about
 how
 this
 will,
 you
 know,


work
 um
 and
 whether
 that's
 a
 good


alternative,
 especially
 for
 females
 that


are
 concerned
 because
 they
 do
 have
 um


you
 know,
 counter
 contraindications
 for


taking
 menopause
 hormone
 therapy.
 So,


that's
 another
 thing
 women
 can
 approach


their
 doctor
 and
 advocate
 for
 themselves


um
 to
 consider
 menopause
 hormone


therapy,
 but
 you
 really
 need
 to,
 you


know,
 talk
 with
 your
 doctor,
 find
 a


doctor
 that's
 open
 to
 these


conversations
 and
 consider
 your
 your


personal
 history.
 um
 you
 know
 whether
 or


not
 you
 have
 a
 history
 of
 heart
 attack


and
 stroke
 because
 these
 um
 hormone


replacement
 therapy
 it
 does
 increase


risk
 of
 these
 things
 and
 so


cardiovascular
 health
 is
 important
 to


consider
 your
 family
 history
 of
 cancer


but
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 family
 history
 of


cancer
 I
 will
 say
 that
 the
 original


scare
 from
 the
 women's
 health
 initiative


study
 um
 it
 was
 you
 know
 the
 percentage


of
 risk
 was
 not
 as
 high
 as
 people
 were


led
 to
 believe


>> and
 there
 are
 I
 know
 a
 person
 that
 has,


you
 know,
 had
 personally
 had
 a
 breast


cancer
 scare
 and,
 you
 know,
 was
 treated


for
 breast
 cancer
 and
 was
 on
 menopause


hormone
 therapy
 afterwards.
 So,
 it
 is


possible.
 You
 just
 need
 a
 doctor
 that's


willing
 to
 walk
 that
 walk,
 you
 know,


path
 with
 you
 and
 treat
 you
 and
 see
 you


regularly
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you
 can


maintain
 menopause
 hormone
 therapy
 while


still
 maintaining
 the
 rest
 of
 your


body's
 health.
 taking
 HRT
 right
 now.


It's,
 you
 know,
 thought
 that
 it's
 best


to
 take
 it
 when
 you
 enter
 pmenopause
 and


into
 menopause,
 but
 then
 to
 stop
 taking


it,
 like
 not
 to
 stay
 on
 menopause


hormone
 therapy
 long
 term,
 because
 we


still
 don't
 know
 about
 the
 long-term


effects,
 and
 there's
 mixed
 results
 as


far
 as
 um
 the
 cost
 and
 benefits.
 There


are
 some
 studies
 from
 the
 UK
 bio
 bank
 um


led
 by
 Claudia
 Bar
 and
 others
 that
 show


that
 women
 that
 have
 a
 history
 of


staying
 on
 menopause
 hormone
 therapy


long
 term
 they
 showed
 more
 hypocample


volume
 loss
 and
 you
 know
 more
 gray


matter
 loss.
 So
 there
 are
 we
 don't
 know


why
 because


>> because
 we
 don't
 study
 women's
 health.


No,
 we
 don't
 study
 women's
 health
 and


this
 is
 like
 just
 like
 a
 cross-sectional


data.
 Like
 what
 we
 need
 is
 a
 large
 scale


longitudinal
 study
 that
 really
 considers


historically
 the
 different
 sex
 specific


experiences
 of
 females.
 Like
 we
 want
 to


understand
 women's
 body
 health
 and
 brain


health.
 We
 need
 to
 study
 from
 menration


to
 through
 parody
 pregnancies
 through


menopause
 like
 longitudinally
 at least


cross-
 section
 like
 put
 a
 bunch
 of


studies
 together
 that
 are
 longitudinal


in
 nature
 to
 really
 get
 a
 full
 map
 of


how
 do
 women
 age
 right
 it
 just
 makes
 me


really
 upset
 to
 think
 of
 all
 the


millions
 of
 women
 who've
 had
 to
 suffer


as
 we
 just
 play
 catch-up
 to


>> you
 know
 the
 lack
 of
 funding
 the
 lack
 of


research
 um
 for
 you
 what
 makes
 you


hopeful


Um
 what
 makes
 me
 hopeful
 is
 that
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 female
 scientists
 and
 male


scientists
 that
 are
 advocating
 for
 this


in
 Canada,
 in
 Europe,
 in
 the
 US.
 Um
 I


think
 we
 realize
 how
 much
 biological
 sex


and
 sex
 specific
 experiences
 um
 shape


our
 brain
 health
 and
 our
 body
 health.


And
 people
 are
 understanding
 more
 and


more
 that
 the
 brain
 is
 not
 living
 in


isolation.
 that
 things
 that
 happen
 in


our
 body
 and
 in
 our
 environment
 affect


our
 brain
 health
 and
 so
 there
 is
 this


growing
 awareness
 of
 brain
 body


interactions
 and
 you
 know
 social
 context


and
 its
 effects
 on
 brain
 health
 and


there
 is
 a
 movement
 I
 think
 within
 the


neuroscience
 community
 to
 really
 invest


in
 research
 uh
 that
 looks
 at
 this
 and


that
 puts
 women's
 brain
 health
 at
 the


forefront
 like
 that
 is
 the
 first
 thing


we
 should
 be
 doing
 in
 order
 to
 get
 a


bigger
 picture
 of
 how
 the
 brain
 um
 how


brain
 health
 evolves
 over
 the
 lifespan


women
 that
 are
 considering
 taking
 more


menopause
 hormone
 therapy.
 And
 I've
 said


this
 um
 on
 some
 on
 social
 media
 and


sometimes
 get
 backlash
 for
 it,
 but


it
 is
 important
 to
 find
 a
 doctor
 that


listens
 to
 you
 um
 and
 not
 to
 just
 follow


the
 advice
 of
 individuals
 on
 social


media
 that
 may
 not
 have
 the
 training.


And
 I
 understand
 that
 there's


frustration
 in
 the
 space
 because
 a
 lot


of
 females
 are
 talking
 to
 their
 doctors


and
 are
 being
 like
 shut
 down
 or
 told,


you
 know,
 you're
 being
 you're
 being


silly,
 right?


>> Just
 lose
 5
 pounds.


>> Yeah.
 [laughter]
 Exactly.
 And
 that's


that's
 not
 cool
 either.
 Like
 you
 have
 to


find
 you
 have
 to
 keep
 sadly
 we
 have
 to


be
 our
 own
 advocate
 and
 listen
 to
 our


own
 bodies.
 And
 so
 that's
 the
 other


thing
 I'd
 like
 I'd
 like
 to
 say.
 If
 you


do
 go
 on
 menopause
 hormone
 therapy,


listen
 to
 your
 body.
 you
 know,
 if
 your


body
 doesn't
 feel
 right,
 you
 should
 talk


to
 your
 doctor
 about
 that.
 Not
 just,
 oh


well,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 this,


so
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 stick
 to
 menopause


hormone
 therapy
 because
 from
 my
 personal


experience,
 right,
 I
 went
 on
 menopause


hormone
 therapy
 because
 I
 was
 having
 hot


flashes.
 And
 then
 I
 started
 to
 feel


tightness
 in
 my
 chest.


>> And
 so
 I
 had
 to
 listen
 to
 that.
 And
 I


went
 and
 I
 went
 through
 visited
 a


cardiologist,
 got
 my
 heart
 checked,


okay?
 And
 they
 gave
 me
 the
 green
 light


to
 keep
 staying
 on
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 went


back
 on
 it.
 But
 there
 was
 a
 moment
 like


where
 you
 have
 to
 listen
 and
 say,
 "Okay,


is
 my
 heart
 healthy
 enough
 to
 be
 on


menopause
 hormone
 therapy,
 especially
 if


you
 have
 a
 family
 history
 of
 heart


attacks
 or
 stroke
 like
 my
 family
 does."


And
 so
 you
 need
 to
 listen
 to
 your
 body.


So
 you're
 you're
 you're
 the
 best


advocate
 for
 yourself.


>> Professor
 Raja,
 it's
 been
 such
 a


pleasure.
 I've
 learned
 so
 much.
 You
 make


a
 complicated
 subject
 quite
 uh
 you
 know


how
 to
 communicate
 really
 well.
 Thank


you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> I
 appreciate
 you
 being
 on
 the
 podcast.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> That
 was
 Mistreated.
 Thanks
 for


listening.
 You
 can
 follow
 our
 show


wherever
 you
 get
 your
 podcasts
 so
 that


you
 can
 get
 notified
 each
 time
 a
 new


episode
 is
 available.
 We
 would
 love
 to


hear
 your
 feedback.
 You
 can
 write
 me
 an


email
 at
 mistreatedodcast
 at
 tvo.org
 or


reach
 out
 on
 my
 social
 channels.
 We've


got
 some
 reaction
 to
 our
 last
 episode
 on


cranial
 cervical
 instability
 and
 Ella's


Danlo
 syndrome.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


interviewing
 Sydney
 and
 bringing


attention
 to
 cranial
 cervical


instability
 CCI.
 What
 patients
 are


facing
 across
 every
 province
 in
 Canada


is
 devastating
 and
 can
 have
 lifelong


impacts.
 [music]
 We
 lack
 trained


experts,
 accessible
 care,
 and
 clear


diagnostic
 criteria.
 Uh,
 one
 of
 the


shocking
 things
 I've
 learned
 about
 these


conditions
 is
 how
 few
 people
 are
 in
 the


country
 who
 can
 help
 to
 diagnose
 and
 to


treat
 cranial
 cervical
 disability
 and


[music]
 Ella's
 Danlo
 syndrome.
 So,
 a
 lot


of
 people
 end
 up
 fighting
 for
 care
 and


if
 they
 have
 the
 financial
 means,
 they


travel
 outside
 of
 Canada
 to
 get
 that


care
 and
 it
 shouldn't
 be
 that
 way.
 We


have
 another
 comment
 from
 last
 week's


episode.
 There
 are
 so
 many


underdiagnosed
 and
 mistreated
 citizens


in
 Canada.
 Canadian
 healthcare
 and


governments
 need
 to
 take
 care
 of
 its


people
 and
 it
 is
 clearly
 doing
 a
 failing


job
 despite
 being
 a
 wealthy
 country.


Thank
 you
 TVO
 for
 your
 professional


journalism
 and
 kudos
 to
 Sydney
 for


articulating
 a
 very
 complex
 topic.


[music]


CCI
 and
 EDS
 are
 incredibly
 complex


issues
 and
 as
 we
 mentioned
 last
 week,


mistreater
 will
 be
 investigating
 what
 is


going
 on
 with
 treatment,
 diagnosis,
 and


how
 patients
 are
 being
 impacted.
 Look


for
 that
 in
 early
 26.
 We've
 got
 one
 more


comment.
 Healthc
 care
 is
 a
 human
 right.


Governments
 need
 to
 step
 up
 more
 to


unbburden
 citizens
 from
 this
 healthcare


tragedy.
 We
 really
 appreciate
 all
 of


those
 comments
 and
 my
 deepest


appreciation
 to
 Sydney
 for
 using
 her


voice
 to
 bring
 attention
 to
 this.
 This


is
 our
 last
 episode
 of
 the
 year,
 but
 we


will
 be
 back
 in
 January
 2026.
 Thank
 you


so
 much
 for

 the
 support
 on

podcast.
 And
 as
 mentioned,
 email
 us
 your


uh
 suggestions,
 your
 comments,

 uh
 we


will

 to
 incorporate
 them
 into
