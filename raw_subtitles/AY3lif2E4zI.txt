Let's look at how Claude accelerates private equity deal flow from days to hours. We'll follow Sarah, an associate at Riverside Partners on the Southside, and Jen, a VP at Walt Capital on the Bi side. They're working on Horizon Health Group, an $85 million healthcare services business. Sarah needs a DO teaser and asks Claude to create a client-ready presentation using the DO teaser skill. Claude searches Ignite, finding financials, customer analysis, and operations data, and extracting revenue, margins, retention metrics, and facility details. In under two minutes, Sarah's got a professional teaser ready to send. The teaser lands in Jenzenbox. She asks Claude to screen it and build a leveraged bio model using the LPO skill. Claude pulls from SharePoint for investment criteria and extracts data from the teaser. Within minutes, Jen gets a comprehensive screening memo and sees that Horizon Health seems to check all the boxes. But Claude has deeper diligence. It searches the Ignite datarum to find that Blue Cross Regional is 18% of revenue with a contract that expires December 2025. 28% of revenue has short-term termination clauses. This is risk that wouldn't have been picked up at a claim. The verdict conditional pass that BlueCrust renewal needs to be locked down. Nogen looks at the numbers. Claude built a complete model in minutes, which would have taken an analyst hours. Purchase price at 11 times EBITDA, five times leverage with five year cashflow projections and a debt amortization. An upside and base case. This case shows 26% IR and a 3x money multiple, well above the 20% hurdle. Jen stress tests with Claude, asking to add a downside case in Excel. Claude immediately builds a new scenario with lower growth and margin assumptions. Jen sees Claude's work in real time and validates its assumptions. Downside yields 19% IR right after threshold. she asks for a sensitivity analysis. Claude builds a matrix, 8x to 12x exits. At 10x, the numbers tie exactly to the model. Even at 8x, the returns are acceptable. The fan of outcomes look good. It's Monday morning, and Jen has an investment committee meeting in a few hours. She asked Claude to synthesize everything with a letter of intent recommendation. In minutes, Jen receives an investment committee deck with a recommendation to proceed with a letter of intent at 10 to 11 times EBITDA. Claude flags contract risks as pre-LOI conditions. Base case generates 26% IOR. Downside 19%. LOI recommendation, 11 times if Blue Cross is locked down. Takeoff return if not. Sarah went from data room to teaser in two minutes. Jen took a teaser to an investment recommendation in 48 hours. Claude caught a material contract risk by reading the data room files, then quantified the deal still works. This is better diligence, faster.
