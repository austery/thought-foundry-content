The government says having
police officers in schools
would protect students
and build trust.
But others say
the school resource officer
program wouldn't address
the root cause of violence
and would make some students
feel unsafe.
So what does the data tell us?
I got insight into the
program's pros and cons from
Leeann Cole school trustee for
Mississauga Wards one and seven,
and David Bosveld, co-founder
of Peel Black Collective and
Black Education Fund and powers
in a Human Rights Educator.
David, Leanne, welcome to
the program.
How are you guys doing?
>> Great.
Thanks.
>> Thank you.
I'm doing well.
>> All right.
We're going to start off with
Bill 33 right into it,
the Ontario government's
Bill 33, the Supporting
Children and Students Act,
calls on school boards to
implement School Resource
Officer SRO programs,
where such programs are
available.
Now, Leanne, you introduced
a motion at a recent
Peel District School Board
meeting regarding the program.
What did your motion set out
to do?
>> So the motion is to invite
the police, meaning Peel
Regional Police and the OPP,
to come to the school board
and have a discussion with
staff as to how it might look
like if this program is
reintroduced.
>> All right.
I should mention you were
speaking today.
>> I am not speaking on behalf
of the board today.
I'm speaking from
what I feel personally.
>> All right, David, take us
back a little bit.
2017.
That is when the SRO program
ended.
2020, 2020.
Sorry, what was the SRO
program and why did it end
in 2020?
>> Well, it was in the wake of
the murder of George Floyd,
and I think there was a real
impetus to look at structures
and systems, and particularly
how they affect marginalised
groups, black people,
Indigenous folks.
And the Peel police
entered a conversation with
the community where feedback
was given and taken.
And, you know, we learned that
the Peel Regional Police, some
of their officers were using
the program to hone their
investigative skills and for
advancement in their jobs.
And we heard the story
of the 6-year-old girl who was
handcuffed and shackled.
And ultimately, you know,
we had this series of
very difficult discussions.
And the Peel police
determined on their own
to end the program.
And the political environment
has subsequently changed
a little bit.
It's five years later.
People aren't thinking so much
about, you know, the so-called
Wokeism.
And here we are in an
environment where people are,
you know, actively wishing to
have police officers back in
schools.
>> In terms of the programs
length, how long did it
actually last for before
all of that feedback?
>> I don't know specifically
how long it was there, but it
was there long enough to create
significant harm.
>> All right.
I should mention that we did
reach out for a statement from
the Ministry of Education.
We did not hear back
in time for the taping.
Leanne help us understand,
how the SRO program is supposed
to work.
>> I really can't speak to how
it was supposed to work
before I was a trustee,
but from what I know,
they were supposed to be
there as a support for students,
to build relationships with
students.
They weren't there
specifically to get students in
trouble
or to arrest them or
or anything like that.
It was mainly just
to create a relationship with
students
and in a supportive way.
>> So help us understand.
So from a day to day,
what would that look like?
with a police officer in the
classroom,
>> What would it look like
without them?
>> With them?
>> I don't necessarily know
if they were in the classrooms.
I think they could have been
anywhere
on on school property.
but, you know, this is why
I'm bringing this motion forward
now, is to see what
that might look like going
forward,
because we do recognize that it
wasn't
wasn't perfect, but thorough
mistakes.
>> All right.
I want to show a graphic.
This is data compiled by
Global News in late August
showing the number of
violent incidences in Ontario
schools.
As you can see, the numbers
creep up just before
the pandemic, a drop to around
1000 in the middle of the
pandemic when schools were
closed and then rise to over
4000 after the school closures
ended.
David, is there a connection
between the end of the SRO
program and the rise of
violence in schools?
>> Well, I don't think so.
And like Trustee Cole said,
right, the SRO program
is not designed to be
an enforcement program,
but a relationship-building
program.
So the folks that are,
you know, saying, hey, our
schools are unsafe, bring back
police officers, and then
they'll be safe.
I think our contorting right
what the purpose of those
programs was building
relationships is not arresting
and handcuffing and dealing
with discipline that could be
handled by school staff
and principals.
So I think, you know,
the previous design of
the program, although it was
intended to be, you know,
relationship building morphed
into, you know, the principal
could call on the police
officer to address certain
issues.
And the police officers were,
you know, willingly doing that.
And so it ended up with
the criminalisation of kids.
And when we look at Peel
Regional Police, specifically
where I'm from in Brampton,
what we find is in the
community and based on the data
that they present annually
around use of force, black
people represent 10% of the
community, but 30% of the
use-of-force incidents.
So if you were to introduce
police officers in schools,
I don't think it's a difficult
assumption to assume that if
the schools had 10% black
student population, that they
could be receiving 30% of
negative police interactions in
whatever form those existed.
And so I think, you know, also,
Trustee Cole makes a good point
that there needs to be supports
in schools.
And the question is what are
those supports more guidance
counsellors, perhaps smaller
class sizes, child and youth
workers, social workers,
mental health professionals
which are trained professionals
to deal with children.
Right.
And police are trained
professionals to deal with
crime.
And so we're introducing,
you know, potentially a support
into schools that, you know,
perhaps goes a bit too far.
>> I want to get your take
on that.
You know, David makes a--
>> I completely agree.
And I think, you know,
and I'm hoping this is
if my motion is passed
by other trustees, that when we
do have those discussions with
the police and the board, I'm
hoping their report can bring
back, you know, what are we
going to do different next time?
How are we going to make sure
that we're available for kids
and not only the kids, but the
staff, so that they feel a
sense of safety as well?
Parents.
Right.
I think it's everybody.
And we have to make sure
that it's done in a way that,
you know, they're not there
to arrest or lay charges
because we don't want the kids
thinking that they're in
trouble and they're walking
into, you know, that feeling
every day.
We want them to feel safe.
That's what our whole motto is
safe and caring schools.
>> In terms of the graph
that we saw there, you
mentioned a little bit a
connection between the end of
the program and what we've seen
as someone who's, you know,
been around schools and.
Students coming out of the
pandemic, things are different.
I think we can we can look at
sort of, you know, what those
those years have done.
And anecdotally, we can
we can see what students are
saying and teachers are saying.
But is there a connection
between those two?
>> I don't know, and I don't
know if we've had enough time
to really look at the data,
you know, 2020, 2021, 2022
was just a couple of years ago.
So and is it only the pandemic?
I think there's a lot of
factors here that we have to
consider.
And I think if we do have the
program come back, it has to be
somehow measurable so that we
can see what the actual issues
are and why they're present
now.
So I really can't speak to
that.
I think we still need to
see what the data shows for
2024 or 2025 and make a
determination from there.
>> All right.
I want to read
the Ontario Human Rights
Commission's submission
on Bill 33.
Let's have a read there.
By mandating the implementation
of SRO programs, Bill 33
disempowers school boards and
prevents them from filling
their responsibility to protect
the rights of all students
under the Ontario Human Rights
Code.
This is particularly concerning
in jurisdictions including
Peel and Toronto,
where black students and
communities have routinely
communicated the systemic harms
associated with SRO programs.
So pretty much what you had
highlighted, David, does
this bill ignore the concerns
of racialized communities about
systemic discrimination?
>> Well, 100%.
Right.
And it's being rushed through
the legislature.
These discussions happened.
They're ongoing discussions.
Once the removal of the SRO
program happened, by the way,
that was the Peel police
that made that decision.
It wasn't the school board, the
community members, you know,
supported that decision.
The Peel police then went
further and partnered with
the OHRC on what they called
their Human Rights Project.
And within that project item
or recommendation 12 talks
very specifically about
the importance of ending
the SRO programs in police
programming in schools.
And they have developed
a protocol.
Right.
So for the average member
of the public that thinks,
hey, police aren't allowed
in schools at all, it's unsafe,
kids are fighting
and violence is happening,
vaping all of these things.
There's a protocol that exists,
and I think it would be fair
to measure that existing
protocol and determine
whether it's working optimally
or whether it needs to be
adjusted.
But police are invited into
schools under specific
circumstances.
Safety issues, crimes and other
issues that it's determined
that the principals, the
superintendents and the school
staff can address.
Right.
Often these are kids.
They're 12 year olds,
15 year olds, 10 year olds,
6 year olds.
>> Cops be a deterrent.
>> You know?
I mean, cops might
be a deterrent to something,
but they may create fear.
When you think of, you know,
neurodivergent students, black
and indigenous students,
newcomers that maybe are
undocumented, like going to
your school and seeing a cop
could, you know, really be
traumatizing for people.
Also, people who have had
negative interactions
with police.
So I think and I'll just
reiterate, in the school
environment, we should be
pressing for resources
and funding for things
that support students
social emotional well-being.
And that would be the things
I listed before, right?
More guidance counsellors,
smaller class sizes,
extra supports as child
and youth workers.
Those are the professionals
that can really help deal with
behavioural issues.
And, you know, the introduction
of SRO programs,
it's always stated as,
oh, it's just to build
relationships, but it's always
also, you know, under the guise
of schools are unsafe.
And if a cops there,
you know, maybe they can
address some of these issues,
you know, and that will
end up, we know,
disproportionately
criminalizing students from
marginalised groups.
>> All right.
With that, I want to get
a better understanding of
what you're hearing from
parents.
Are they asking for police
to be on school grounds
through this program?
>> I think from what I know,
the majority of them are,
we actually went out into
the community, myself
and a few other trustees.
It was after an incident
had occurred in Caledon
whereby a parent was very upset
about what happened to
their child, and so we took
a petition in the community
and we just chose random areas
in Mississauga, Brampton
and Caledon.
We went door to door
and we spoke to parents,
and sometimes if their kids
were home, the kids too.
And we asked them,
we asked them, is this
something that you would
support if the school board
could facilitate a conversation
with the police about what this
might look like going forward?
And from the signatures that I
got, which is roughly about 100,
I would say, I think I had one
person say no.
So, you know,
but again, to your point, I
agree with you at the same time,
because it has to be a program
that works.
It has to be measurable.
And I know you said that
we're keyword, you know,
we have to be able to measure
this.
So what are we doing right?
And what are we doing wrong.
And if it does come back,
and this is why I've put this
motion forward to discuss this
with staff and the police,
what is it going to look like?
How are we going to measure
this?
What?
Maybe we just start with
a couple schools at first.
Maybe the officers not in
uniform, maybe they're
plainclothes, I don't know, but
that's why I put this motion
forward to see what it might
look like.
Because there is a sense
of fear right now.
Right?
So and it's hard to look at
the broader picture and decide,
like, who do we listen to
this group, this group.
So, you know,
we have to work with everybody
to make sure that it's done
right.
>> All right.
I should mention,
you know, 100 signatures is not
a it's not a huge number.
But I do want to ask David,
if a majority of students,
parents and teachers
did want the program back,
would you support it.
>> If they did want the program
back?
No.
Absolutely not.
So, and the reason
is very simple.
If you go out into the
community with an equity lens
and keeping in mind the history
and the context of the Peel
District School Board that was
placed under supervision
because of an unwillingness
and inability to address
specifically anti-Black racism
and other forms of
discrimination.
That was in 2020 as well.
And the commitment and the
directives from the
Ministry of Education
were all around equity
and listening to marginalised
voices of people from
marginalised communities.
And it's those voices that are
going to experience harm, and
policing creates harm in those
communities in every example.
Right.
So we couldn't possibly
be naive enough to think that
in a school environment,
policing programs would, you
know, not harm black students
and other marginalised students.
And I think the idea of
majorities, you know, speaking
out and saying, yeah, we want
police like you would have to
give some education to folks
and explain what the history is,
what the current state is,
why we got to where we got,
what the safety issues are,
what the other possible
solutions for.
You know, if there are safety
issues.
Your graph demonstrated
that perhaps there's more
violent incidents in schools.
So I would suggest let's look
at the root causes of these
violent, you know, these
occurrences of violence.
And let's really think and be
intentional about how do we
resolve that.
Because putting an SRO
and building relationships
with police officers does not
address why students are vaping,
why students are fighting,
why students are skipping class,
why, you know, certain groups
of students perhaps are not as
connected to their educational
environment in healthy ways.
And, you know, that's the
support that they need.
And I'll say it, you know, a
thousand times police officers
are not trained to be child and
youth workers and introducing
them to the school.
The cost, right.
Their budgets are ballooning.
They're saying that
they don't have the resources
to deal with car theft and
crime in the community, which
they also say is on the rise.
And they're going to literally
embed a police officer, you
know, in multiple schools
across the province of Ontario.
I don't think it makes sense.
I think we should have a
constructive conversation about
what type of supports and
resources the province can add
to create real safety in
schools for everybody.
>> All right.
So Bill 33 went for a final
vote today.
Leanne, I want to better
understand you in terms of
a timeline.
When do you expect the SRO
program to be implemented
in Peel?
>> I wish I could answer that,
and honestly, I have no idea.
I haven't been told anything
and I don't have any guess.
But I do agree with
what you said.
It would be great if we could
have more social workers
and support workers in the
school when it comes.
You're right, it comes down to
funding, and for us to have
the police back, that's at
no cost to the board.
But you made an interesting
point that they're not trained
in child and youth worker
type work.
And maybe that's something
that we could look at
that the police get that
kind of training.
>> Yeah, I think so.
But I think that, you know,
assuming that a police officer
who's been hired to be
a police officer has been
put through, you know,
use of force training,
how to arrest people,
how to investigate crimes,
that is their core function.
And then layering on top of
that and saying,
now you're going to become,
you know, the person that
guides children into
better decisions or builds
relationships with children
or, you know, disrupts problems
within the school.
I think we're missing
the point that
there are people who are
professional at this who went
to school to be to work with
children and to help
and support them.
And those are the people
that we need in the schools.
>> David, you get the last word
on this.
if you could,
how do you change the
government's
position on this?
>> Well, there's been a ton of
advocacy.
you know,
we're not in a political
environment
that is the same as
we were in 2020, but in 2020, we
saw,
you know, boards
played the particularly appeal
board placed under supervision
directives issued,
by the Minister of Education to,
you know, begin to address
the systemic
anti-Black racism that existed,
and continues to exist.
And so, you know, it's
advocacy,
it's groups like policing free
schools,
Boys and Powers, Peel Black
Collective.
There's a whole bunch of groups
out there
that are
educating and mobilizing
community members
to, you know, really understand
this issue because
without understanding the issue,
I think,
you know, in fairness
to the folks that say yes to,
you know, police back in
schools,
you know,
they want their kids to be safe.
And this is what's
being proposed to keep them safe
and nothing else.
So let's have a broader
discussion about what,
you know,
long term,
going to create safety
in schools for children and for
staff,
for everybody.
>> All right.
We will leave it there.
Leanne, David, thank you
so much for your insights.
I'm sure this will be a
conversation that we will be
following closely.
So really appreciate your time.
>> Thank you for having us.
>> Thank you.
