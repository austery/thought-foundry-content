From
 the
 [music]
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's


the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.


Today's
 Thursday,
 January
 15th.
 Here's


what
 we're
 covering.


>> In
 Minneapolis,
 a
 federal
 agent
 shot
 and


injured
 a
 man
 while
 trying
 to
 detain


him,
 touching
 off
 a
 tense
 night
 of


protests
 in
 a
 city
 that's
 already
 been


on
 edge.
 The
 protesters
 clashed
 with
 law


enforcement
 at
 the
 scene
 of
 the


shooting,
 throwing
 snowballs
 and


fireworks.
 Federal
 agents
 responded
 with


canisters
 of
 gas
 and
 chemical
 agents.


>> It
 has
 absolutely
 become
 an
 unlawful


assembly.
 It
 is
 well
 past
 the
 line
 and


people
 need
 to
 leave.


>> As
 the
 clashes
 escalated,
 the
 city's


police
 chief
 and
 mayor
 went
 live
 with
 a


press
 conference
 urging
 demonstrators
 to


walk
 away.
 For
 anyone
 that
 is
 taking
 the


bait
 tonight,
 stop.
 That
 is
 not
 helpful.


Go
 home.


>> The
 Department
 of
 Homeland
 Security
 said


yesterday's
 shooting
 happened
 around
 700


p.m.
 during
 a
 traffic
 stop
 in
 which


federal
 agents
 were
 trying
 to
 arrest
 a


man
 from
 Venezuela
 who
 was
 in
 the


country
 illegally.
 A
 DHS
 spokeswoman


said
 he
 fled
 and
 then
 assaulted
 the


officer
 who
 chased
 after
 him.
 She
 said


two
 other
 people
 also
 jumped
 in
 to


attack
 the
 officer
 using
 a
 broom
 and
 a


snow
 shovel.
 At
 that
 point,
 the
 agent


fired
 his
 gun,
 striking
 the
 man
 in
 the


leg.
 The
 Times
 couldn't
 immediately


verify
 the
 federal
 government's
 account


of
 what
 happened.


>> There's
 still
 a
 lot
 that
 we
 don't
 know


at
 this
 time,
 but
 what
 I
 can
 tell
 you


for
 certain
 is
 that
 this
 is
 not


sustainable.
 At
 the
 press
 conference,


the
 mayor
 repeated
 the
 call
 he
 made
 last


week
 after
 Renee
 Good
 was
 killed
 by
 an


ICE
 officer.
 That
 he
 wants
 the
 federal


deployment
 in
 the
 city
 to
 end.


>> My
 concern


is
 that
 yet
 another
 shooting
 will
 take


place.
 Yet
 another
 person
 will
 be


injured
 or
 killed.
 People
 are
 scared.


Yesterday,
 a
 judge
 declined
 to
 rule


immediately
 on
 a
 lawsuit
 that
 Minnesota


officials
 filed
 trying
 to
 block
 a
 surge


of
 agents
 to
 the
 [music]
 state.
 She's


given
 the
 Justice
 Department
 until


Monday
 to
 respond


[music]


on
 this
 vote.
 The
 yays
 are
 50,
 the


naysay
 are
 50,
 the
 Senate
 being
 equally


divided,
 the
 vice
 president
 votes,
 and


the
 point
 of
 order
 is
 sustained.


>> In
 the
 Senate
 yesterday,
 Republicans


blocked
 a
 measure
 that
 would
 have


reigned
 in
 President
 Trump's
 war
 powers


by
 forcing
 him
 to
 get
 congressional


approval
 for
 any
 future
 military
 action


in
 Venezuela.
 The
 resolution
 had
 moved


forward
 last
 week
 with
 the
 support
 of
 a


handful
 of
 GOP
 senators,
 but
 after
 a


pressure
 campaign
 from
 Trump
 and
 the


White
 House,
 two
 of
 them,
 Josh
 Holly
 of


Missouri
 and
 Todd
 Young
 of
 Indiana,


backed
 down,
 sinking
 the
 effort.
 Holly


said
 he
 changed
 his
 mind
 after
 Secretary


of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio
 assured
 him
 that


Congress
 would
 be
 notified
 about
 any


future
 military
 actions.
 So
 far,
 those


notifications
 have
 come
 only
 after


operations
 have
 been
 carried
 out,


including
 dozens
 of
 deadly
 strikes
 on


boats
 and
 the
 raid
 to
 capture


Venezuela's
 President
 Nicholas
 Maduro.


>> The
 problem
 we
 have
 is
 the
 Constitution


gives
 us
 the
 power
 to
 initiate
 war,
 to


declare
 war.
 But
 if
 we
 don't
 know
 if


it's
 a
 war
 until
 after
 all
 the
 people


die,
 wouldn't
 it
 then
 be
 a
 little
 bit


late
 to
 vote
 on
 initiating
 the
 war?


Senator
 Ran
 Paul,
 one
 of
 just
 three


Republicans
 who
 did
 stick
 with
 Democrats


in
 supporting
 the
 bill,
 criticized
 the


vote,
 [music]
 saying
 the
 administration


has
 been
 misleading
 lawmakers.


Meanwhile,
 the
 US
 has
 started
 selling


millions
 of
 barrels
 of
 Venezuelan
 oil.


According
 to
 people
 familiar
 with
 the


deal,
 the
 oil
 has
 been
 stuck
 in
 the


country
 since
 the
 US
 started
 a
 naval


blockade
 against
 tankers
 going
 in
 or


out.
 that
 had
 pushed
 Venezuela's
 economy


to
 the
 brink,
 and
 the
 sales
 now
 will


head
 off
 the
 complete
 collapse
 of
 the


oil
 industry
 there,
 which
 is
 the


country's
 main
 source
 of
 revenue.
 Much


of
 the
 oil
 is
 expected
 to
 eventually
 end


up
 in
 US
 refineries.
 And
 a
 White
 House


spokeswoman
 said
 that
 the
 US's


involvement
 will
 benefit
 both
 Americans


and
 Venezuelans.
 It's
 unclear
 what
 legal


authority
 the
 administration
 is
 using
 to


broker
 any
 deals.


[music]


Now,
 two
 other
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.
 First,


>> we
 have
 been
 informed
 by
 very
 important


sources
 on
 the
 other
 side,
 and
 they've


said
 the
 killing
 is
 stopped
 and
 the


executions
 won't
 take
 place.


>> Trump
 said
 that
 Iran
 appears
 to
 have


stopped
 killing
 protesters
 days
 after
 he


threatened
 to
 attack
 the
 country
 if
 it


didn't
 end
 its
 bloody
 crackdown
 on


anti-government
 demonstrators.
 The


Pentagon
 had
 moved
 another
 warship
 into


the
 region,
 put
 long
 range
 bombers
 on


alert,
 and
 started
 evacuating
 some


personnel
 from
 an
 American
 military


base.
 But
 a
 US
 military
 official
 called


Trump's
 latest
 statements
 an
 offramp


from
 those
 escalating
 tensions.
 Still,


sources
 say
 the
 president
 has
 not
 ruled


out
 using
 military
 force
 against
 Iran,


including
 anything
 from
 a
 cyber
 attack


to
 a
 strike
 against
 the
 country's


security
 forces.
 [music]


And
 in
 an
 extremely
 rare
 move,
 FBI


agents
 searched
 the
 home
 of
 a
 reporter


yesterday
 as
 part
 of
 an
 investigation


into
 leaks
 of
 classified
 information.


The
 journalist,
 Hannah
 Ntonson,
 who


works
 at
 the
 Washington
 Post,
 had


laptops,
 a
 phone,
 and
 a
 smartwatch


seized.
 An
 official
 told
 the
 Times
 that


Nathansson
 had
 been
 messaging
 with
 a


government
 contractor
 who's
 been
 under


investigation
 for
 allegedly
 taking
 home


classified
 documents.
 The
 executive


editor
 of
 the
 Post
 said
 the
 paper
 and


Nathansson
 are
 not
 the
 focus
 of
 the


inquiry,
 but
 that
 the
 FBI
 search
 quote


raises
 profound
 questions
 and
 concern


around
 the
 constitutional
 protections


for
 our
 work.
 By
 law,
 search
 warrants


for
 reporter
 work
 are
 prohibited
 in
 most


cases,
 and
 Justice
 Department


regulations
 say
 that
 the
 government


should
 generally
 try
 to
 negotiate
 with


the
 journalists
 first
 before
 seizing


their
 materials.
 Nathansson
 had
 spent


the
 last
 year
 collecting
 hundreds
 of


firstperson
 accounts
 from
 federal


workers
 about
 the
 administration's


aggressive
 overhaul
 of
 the
 government.


The
 seizure
 of
 her
 devices
 raises
 the


possibility
 that
 the
 Justice
 Department


now
 has
 access
 to
 that
 list
 of
 names.


[music]


A
 new
 report
 from
 federal
 regulators


investigating
 the
 deadly
 crash
 of
 a
 UPS


cargo
 plane
 back
 in
 November
 says
 that


Boeing
 knew
 about
 flaws
 in
 the
 plane
 for


years.
 The
 jet
 had
 just
 taken
 off
 from


Louisville
 when
 one
 of
 its
 engines


caught
 fire
 and
 the
 plane
 plummeted
 into


nearby
 businesses,
 exploding
 in
 a


massive
 fireball
 and
 killing
 15
 people.


An
 official
 cause
 of
 the
 crash
 hasn't


been
 determined
 yet,
 but
 the
 National


Transportation
 Safety
 Board
 says
 that


cracks
 in
 the
 assembly
 holding
 the


engine
 in
 place
 could
 have
 contributed


to
 the
 crash.
 According
 to
 the
 NTSB,


that
 same
 part
 had
 fractured
 in
 a


similar
 way
 at
 least
 four
 other
 times
 on


other
 planes.
 Boeing
 had
 previously
 told


aircraft
 owners
 that
 the
 issue
 would
 not


affect
 flight
 safety.
 In
 response
 to
 the


new
 report,
 a
 Boeing
 representative
 said


the
 company
 supports
 the
 NTSB's


investigation,
 but
 did
 not
 directly


address
 the
 findings.
 The
 company's


planes
 and
 quality
 control
 process
 have


come
 under
 intense
 scrutiny
 in
 recent


years
 after
 a
 series
 of
 deadly
 crashes.


[music]


Dragon
 SpaceX,
 we
 see
 splash
 down.


>> And
 finally,


>> SpaceX
 Dragon,
 we
 copy
 two
 curves.


Splash
 down
 and
 names
 are
 cut.


>> A
 SpaceX
 capsule
 carrying
 four


astronauts
 back
 from
 the
 International


Space
 Station
 splashed
 down
 in
 the


Pacific
 Ocean
 near
 San
 Diego
 in
 the


middle
 of
 the
 night
 last
 night.


>> SpaceX
 Dragon,
 it's
 so
 good
 to
 be
 home.


With
 deep
 gratitude
 to
 the
 teams
 who
 got


us
 there
 and
 back.
 The
 crew's
 return


came
 earlier
 than
 expected.
 NASA
 said


last
 week
 that
 a
 medical
 issue
 on
 board


led
 them
 to
 speed
 things
 up.
 They
 didn't


offer
 any
 details,
 but
 it's
 the
 first


time
 in
 25
 years
 that
 an
 astronaut
 has


left
 the
 ISS
 for
 a
 medical
 reason.
 Two


of
 the
 crew
 are
 from
 NASA.
 One
 is
 from


the
 Japanese
 space
 agency
 and
 the
 other


from
 Russia's.
 During
 live
 coverage
 of


them
 being
 helped
 out
 of
 the
 capsule,


all
 four
 astronauts
 appeared
 to
 be
 in


good
 shape.
 Their
 return
 has
 left
 the


ISS
 slightly
 underst
 staffed,
 but
 only


for
 a
 few
 weeks.
 Four
 more
 astronauts


are
 scheduled
 to
 launch
 in
 the
 middle
 of


next
 month.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.

 at
 how
 the
 criminal


investigation
 into
 the

 of
 the


Federal
 Reserve,
 Jerome
 Powell,

started
 and
 the
 backlash
 it's
 unleashed.
