Where I come from, we greet people:
How are you?
How are the children?
How are the cattle?
Is it raining?
So, how are you?
How are the children?
How the cattle? Do you have cattle?
Do you have moose? Meese?
Mooses? No.
OK.
(Laughter)
Is it raining?
Though here, I think
you should ask for sun.
So yeah.
So I went to Turkana
in 2014 to make a film.
Turkana is in the northernmost
part of Kenya,
and the people there
have been marginalized for so long
that they don't identify as Kenyans.
Post-independence policies had focused
all the resources of the new country
in the agriculturally rich south.
But now, with the discovery of oil,
Kenya was laying claim to Turkana.
Just one generation before,
my family was compelled by the twin forces
of modernity and colonialism
to transition away
from a life of nomadic pastoralism.
My grandfather would still tell stories
of wandering up and down the Rift Valley
with their animals
that seemed so far removed
from the life we lived now.
And he would be like, "This is you,"
pointing to pictures of Maasai
people in full traditional regalia.
And I was like, "No, no, no,
those are the guys who live
in 'National Geographic.'"
(Laughter)
So we went into the project
believing that people wanted
a fair share of the oil revenues,
which they did.
But they wanted so much more.
They wanted water and security
to continue with their
pastoralist way of life,
because it was part
of their culture and identity.
This forced us to think
of new ways of being in the world
that we hadn't previously considered.
I'm going to talk about how
our work in Turkana taught us
to creatively collaborate,
and then how that taught us
to come together, share revenues
and share our humanity.
Turkana is organized
in units called “Ere,”
which have rights
to particular grazing points
and our watering lands.
And this is more like
a custodianship than an ownership,
and it has led organizations on the ground
to think of new sharing models
that were based on the culture,
rather than copy pasting from economies
that had been doing this for longer.
So instead of putting all the resources
into our documentary,
which could be made
by literally three people,
we decided to make something bigger
that could bring in many more artists.
So we brought together ten artists,
five from Nairobi and five from Turkana,
and embarked on a tour of the county.
We went to the oil fields in the south
and danced with an Edong’a 
group in Nakukulas.
We went to Turkana Basin Institute
and saw fossils that were
millions of years old.
We went to Central Island
and visited tilapia,
crocodile and flamingo lakes.
We went swimming in Lake Turkana
under a full moon
that made the lake look like milk.
We were assured that the crocodiles
stayed on their side
and the people stayed on their side.
And anyway, there was the rule of ten.
If ten of you were swimming,
there was only a 10 percent chance
you'd be eaten by a crocodile.
(Laughter)
We went to a cattle kraal
near the River Turkwel
and slept on hides on the ground.
It suddenly made so much sense
to me why we greet the way we do.
How are you, how are the children,
how are the cattle, is it raining?
Those had been the essential elements
of our lives for generations.
Without cattle, we would not survive.
Without the rain, the cattle
would not survive.
Without descendants,
who'd tell our stories when we were gone?
I felt a deep connection
with my grandfather.
In fact,
we all came out of that journey
profoundly moved.
Perhaps it was lying down on the sand
and watching the flights to Europe
and the Middle East pass overhead
and thinking that this was the same path
our human ancestors took
tens of thousands of years ago
to populate the Earth.
Perhaps it was opening up
yourself to the moment
in the place where we first
evolved connection,
cooperation, compassion.
The very things we define as humanity.
So we started to make work
from that basis.
And our shared experiences
plus the new discoveries
made work that exceeded
our individual capabilities.
This is from our first project.
It’s called “The Flyest
Wedding in Africa,”
and we imagined what
the clothes would look like
if we took from what we had seen
rather than, you know,
white dresses and tuxes.
And this is our second project,
It’s called “Floating, Flying.”
We shot it in and around Lake Turkana,
which is one of our biggest
sources of inspiration.
And we imagined a muse
who was also a guardian of the lake.
So what we learned
is that through collaboration,
we align with higher values.
The false notion that we can harm others,
or even our planet,
without harming ourselves, cannot stand.
True connectedness
and participation in something
greater than ourselves
contribute immensely to happiness,
self-worth, and reaffirm our humanity.
This is our third photo series.
It’s called “Oil + Milk”
and we are the land of milk
so we were imagining the effects
that oil would have on our way of life.
And this is our first foray into music.
You can see Elizabeth
and Eddie Gray right there,
and we did this during the pandemic,
so we were not expecting much,
but it has turned out to be
our most beloved
and successful project to date.
So with this work under our belt,
we started to look for an agent
so that we could showcase the work.
And they were like, "Who's the artist?"
And we were like, "All of us."
And they were like, "I can't sell that."
So we built our own platform,
the Nomadic Arts Festival,
to continue this work
and to continue sharing
with so many more artists
and bringing in ancient
and contemporary art forms.
We will close today with two songs
created for the inaugural
edition of the festival.
"Eloto" is a young woman's plea
not to be married off
to a man she doesn't love,
and “Ateker” is a celebration
of our home region.
Thank you.
