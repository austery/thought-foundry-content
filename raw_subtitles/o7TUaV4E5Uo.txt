Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 [music]
 I'm
 Joe


Weisenthal.


>> And
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.


>> Tracy,
 it's
 been
 too
 long
 since
 we've


done
 an
 electricity
 grid
 episode.
 I've


been
 avoiding
 it
 on
 purpose,
 Joe.
 I
 in


all
 honesty,
 I
 I
 really
 find
 this


particular
 market
 slissue
 a
 difficult


one
 to
 talk
 about
 because
 it's


impossible
 to
 talk
 about
 it
 in
 broad


terms.
 And
 I
 know
 on
 OddLots,
 we
 try
 to


avoid
 doing
 that
 generally,
 but
 even
 in


an
 hourong
 podcast,
 even
 with
 multiple


episodes,
 we
 could
 do
 an
 episode
 for


each
 electricity
 market
 in
 the
 United


States
 and
 still
 only
 scratch
 the


surface,
 right?
 Like
 you
 have
 to
 talk


about
 regulated
 monopolies
 versus


competitive
 markets
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to


talk
 about
 what's
 an
 independent
 system


operator
 and
 what's
 like
 well
 what's


Texas
 that's
 a
 whole
 other
 issue.


>> What
 is
 Texas?
 What
 is
 Texas?


>> What
 is
 Texas?
 [laughter]


>> What
 is
 Texas
 would
 be
 its
 own
 episode.


But
 yeah
 that's
 right.
 You
 ask
 a


question
 to
 a
 grid
 expert
 and
 their


first
 thing
 and
 they're
 like
 wait
 are


you
 talking
 about
 a
 competitive
 market


or
 regulated
 market
 here?
 That
 always


>> metered
 basis
 or
 unmetered
 or
 I
 don't


know.
 Uh
 yeah,
 behind
 the
 meter
 etc.


Yeah.
 But
 anyway,
 obviously
 with
 the


sort
 of
 Ian
 Dunning
 who
 we
 recently
 had


Hudson
 River
 Trading,
 he
 was
 talking


about
 how
 you
 know
 their
 main
 constraint


is
 power
 and
 that's
 just
 a
 small
 a
 very


small
 in
 the
 grand
 scheme
 of
 things
 user


of
 AI
 services.
 We
 were
 talking
 about


using
 AI
 and
 high
 frequency
 trading
 and


he
 said
 even
 more
 than
 chips
 that
 the


power
 constraints
 are
 their
 biggest


constraints
 right
 now.
 And
 so
 I
 do
 think


that
 one
 thing
 we
 have
 to
 think
 about
 is


if
 especially
 how
 long
 can
 this
 AI
 boom


go
 on
 is
 what's
 it
 going
 to
 take
 to
 get


all
 of
 this
 AI
 activity
 on
 the
 grid
 like


how
 constrained
 is
 it?


>> That's
 right.
 And
 we
 also
 recorded
 that


episode
 with
 Sager
 and
 Jetty
 and
 we
 were


talking
 about
 the
 political


controversies
 surrounding
 AI
 and


obviously
 power
 consumption
 is
 a
 big
 one


of
 those
 at
 a
 time
 when
 electricity


prices
 have
 already
 been
 rising.
 Is
 AI


only
 going
 to
 drive
 them
 up
 further?


Although
 that
 said,


>> you
 can't
 even
 say
 that
 electricity


prices
 have
 been
 rising
 because
 in


certain
 states
 they've
 actually
 been


going
 down
 on
 an
 inflation
 adjusted


basis.
 So
 even
 that
 is
 a
 nuanced


picture.


>> But
 by
 and
 large,
 especially
 since
 the


pandemic
 really
 by
 and
 large
 we
 have


seen
 faster
 than
 normal
 increase
 in


electricity
 price
 inflation
 and
 we
 have


the
 big
 AI
 question.
 So
 we
 really
 have


to
 figure
 out
 a
 how
 is
 all
 of
 this
 new


data
 center
 capacity
 going
 to
 come
 onto


the
 market
 who's
 going
 to
 supply
 the


generation
 and
 then
 who
 is
 going
 to
 bear


that
 cost.
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 the


consumers
 who
 are
 already
 generally


speaking
 across
 several
 markets
 seeing


their
 bills
 go
 up?


>> If
 we
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 this
 rubber


band
 ball
 market
 then
 I'm
 glad
 we
 at


least
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest
 to
 do
 it.


>> That's
 all
 I'm
 going
 to
 say.


>> We
 do
 in
 fact
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.


very
 excited
 to
 say
 we're
 going
 to
 be


speaking
 uh
 with
 someone
 been
 trying
 to


get
 on
 the
 podcast
 for
 a
 little
 while,


Travis
 Kavula.
 He
 is
 a
 VP
 of
 regulation


at
 NRG
 Energy.
 He's
 also
 been
 on
 a


public
 commission
 in
 Montana,
 so
 he


knows
 that
 side
 of
 the
 business
 in
 terms


of
 how
 prices
 are
 set
 in
 those
 regulated


monopoly
 markets.
 He's
 also
 an
 academic.


Travis,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on


OddLots.


>> It's
 great
 to
 be
 here.
 Thank
 you.


>> We're
 really
 excited
 about
 this
 one


because
 there
 are
 so
 many
 questions.
 Why


are
 we
 talking
 to
 you?
 Why
 don't
 you


give
 us
 the
 sort
 of
 brief
 intro
 of
 what


you
 do
 and
 what
 your
 background
 is
 so


that
 our
 audience
 has
 some
 idea
 of
 why


you're
 the
 perfect
 guest?


>> Sure.
 So,
 I
 spend
 my
 time
 on
 regulatory


affairs
 at
 a
 company
 NRG.
 We're
 a
 big


producer
 of
 power.
 We
 sell
 power
 to


enduse
 customers
 where
 that's
 permitted


by
 law
 where
 competition
 exists
 in
 the


power
 and
 gas
 markets.
 So,
 we've
 got


about
 8
 million
 enduse
 customers.
 And


previously
 I
 was
 the
 head
 of
 the
 Montana


Public
 Service
 Commission,
 the
 rate


setting
 body
 for
 regulated
 utilities
 in


the
 state.
 I
 headed
 up
 an
 organization


that
 represents
 state
 utility


commissions
 at
 the
 national
 level
 called


NEOUK.
 And
 I
 teach
 a
 little
 bit
 on
 the


side
 at
 University
 of
 Chicago's
 Harris


School
 of
 Public
 Policy,
 a
 course
 on


utility
 regulation
 and
 electricity


markets.
 So
 I
 spend
 my
 time
 thinking
 a


lot
 about
 what
 goes
 into
 customer
 bills.


Both
 the
 stuff
 that
 we
 can
 control
 being


a
 company
 that
 is
 a
 provider
 and
 also


stuff
 that
 are
 sort
 of
 upstream
 costs
 of


goods
 sold
 that
 that
 appear
 on
 my


company's
 bills.
 The
 sort
 of
 poles
 and


wires
 charges
 that
 go
 in
 into
 people's


bills.
 So
 ba
 basically,
 you
 know,


there's
 two
 parts
 of
 people's
 bills.
 The


commodity
 and
 the
 regulated
 grid
 charges


that
 get
 the
 commodity
 to
 you.
 And
 both


of
 those
 are
 subject
 to
 some
 form
 of


regulation
 in
 this
 industry.


>> Yeah,
 Tracy,
 when
 we
 were
 in
 Chicago


recently
 for
 a
 live
 episode,
 I
 met
 one


of
 Travis's
 students
 there
 and
 he's


like,
 "You
 got
 to
 talk
 to
 Travis.
 Travis


is
 the
 man
 that
 will
 explain
 all
 these


things."
 So
 glad
 we're
 finally
 making


this
 happen.


>> I'm
 glad
 I
 have
 a
 high
 rating
 for
 from


[laughter]
 the
 students.
 That's


important.


>> From
 rate
 my
 professor.
 That's
 right.


Okay.
 So,
 no
 pressure,
 Travis.
 All


right.
 So
 you
 were
 talking
 about
 the


wholesale
 cost
 of
 the
 thing
 that
 goes


across
 the
 wires
 and
 the
 poles
 and
 all


of
 that.
 So
 that's
 electricity
 versus


the
 actual
 transmission
 system.
 One


thing
 that
 we
 hear
 whenever
 this
 topic


comes
 up
 is
 it's
 not
 necessarily
 about


the
 wholesale
 cost
 of
 electricity.
 It's


the
 cost
 of
 actually
 maintaining
 and


expanding
 the
 grid.
 How
 much
 truth
 is


there
 to
 that?
 If
 you're
 going
 to


pinpoint
 the
 dominant
 factor
 behind


higher
 electricity
 prices
 right
 now,
 is


it
 the
 wholesale
 price
 or
 the
 actual


trans
 cost
 of
 transmission?
 Yeah,
 it's


kind
 of
 the
 scope
 of
 time
 that
 you


choose
 to
 evaluate,
 but
 you
 know,
 just


to
 give
 you
 kind
 of
 a
 benchmarking,
 you


know,
 if
 you
 looked
 at
 say
 the
 New


England
 power
 market
 over
 the
 last
 20


years,
 which
 sort
 of
 is
 the
 beginning


point
 of
 the
 in
 the
 restructuring
 of
 the


industry
 and
 the
 introdu
 introduction
 of


competition
 in
 a
 place
 like
 New
 England,


the
 actual
 commodity
 cost
 would
 have


fallen
 by
 about
 50%
 on
 an
 inflation


adjusted
 basis.
 whereas
 on
 the
 same


basis
 transmission
 costs
 would
 have


increased
 something
 like
 900%.
 Now
 from


a
 very
 low
 level
 to
 a
 much
 more


substantial
 level
 but
 then
 if
 you
 drew


that
 comparison
 in
 another
 market
 say


the
 Mid-Atlantic
 over
 a
 shorter
 period


of
 time
 like
 year-over-year
 you
 know
 the


grid
 costs
 would
 not
 have
 risen


substantially
 in
 a
 year
 but
 power
 prices


would
 have
 and
 that's
 really
 just


because
 the
 commodity
 works
 on
 more


fundamental
 kind
 of
 supply
 and
 demand


balance.
 You
 know,
 scarcity
 will
 drive


up
 prices
 relatively
 rapidly
 and
 then
 an


over
 supply
 that
 occurs
 when
 the
 market


is
 moving
 back
 toward
 equilibrium
 will


drive
 prices
 down
 rapidly.
 Whereas
 those


regulated
 set
 of
 costs
 that
 attach
 to


the
 transmission
 and
 distribution


systems,
 you
 know,
 those
 are
 still
 cost


plus
 regulated
 industries
 and
 they
 have


a
 funny
 way
 of
 working
 monirectionally


up
 over
 the
 course
 of
 time.
 But
 these


two
 things
 trade
 up
 trade
 off
 against


one
 another.
 You
 know,
 you
 need
 to


invest
 in
 transmission
 in
 order
 to


facilitate
 the
 efficient
 delivery
 of


electricity.
 You
 need
 to
 invest
 in
 it
 in


order
 to
 open
 up
 regions
 for
 lowcost


renewable
 energy
 production.
 So,
 they
 do


have
 an
 interactive
 effect,
 but
 they're


regulated
 in
 a
 very
 different
 way.
 And


both
 of
 those
 land
 on
 consumers
 bills.
 I


I
 think
 the
 easiest
 way
 to
 understand


this
 is
 that,
 you
 know,
 consumers
 in
 a


sense
 had
 maybe
 been
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the


regulated
 charges
 the
 proverbial
 frog


and
 gradually
 warming
 water.
 And
 then


when
 you
 finally
 enter
 a
 commodity
 super


cycle,
 people
 can
 have
 the
 sense
 that,


oh
 wow,
 someone
 just
 ratcheted
 up
 the


heat
 on
 this
 pot.
 But
 both
 of
 those
 are


contributing
 factors
 and
 they
 require


sort
 of
 different
 structural
 approaches


in
 order
 to
 reckon
 with
 them.


>> Joe,
 this
 is
 my
 perennial
 frustration


talking
 about
 electricity
 prices
 and
 the


electricity
 system
 in
 the
 US,
 which
 is


you
 cannot
 talk
 in
 generalities,
 right?


There
 are
 different
 types
 of
 regulations


for
 different
 entities.
 There
 are


different
 regulations
 for
 each
 state


basically.
 There's,
 you
 know,
 the
 New


England
 system,
 then
 there's
 the
 West


Coast,
 and
 then
 there's
 Texas,
 which
 is


its
 own
 special
 entity.
 You
 kind
 of
 have


to
 talk
 about
 every
 single
 market
 in


isolation,
 which
 is
 difficult
 even
 on
 a


hourong
 podcast.
 So
 that's
 going
 to
 be


the
 caveat
 throughout
 this
 conversation.


I
 think


>> it's
 idiosyncratic.
 And
 it's
 funny


because
 at
 the
 same
 time
 restructuring


and
 competition
 was
 introduced
 into
 this


industry,
 it
 was
 also
 occurring
 in


things
 like
 telecom.
 Telecom,
 you
 know,


was
 substantially
 deregulated
 and


federalized
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 States,


however,
 were
 left
 to
 make
 their
 own


decisions
 about
 the
 power
 sector.
 And
 as


a
 result,
 you
 really
 have
 a
 huge


patchwork
 quilt
 of
 state
 and
 federal


regulation
 and
 different
 industry


models.
 It's
 true.


>> I
 have
 a
 really
 another
 really


rudimentary
 question,
 I
 guess.
 What
 are


we
 even
 talking
 about
 when
 we
 talk
 about


competition
 in
 electricity?
 You
 know,
 I


don't
 get
 to
 choose
 which
 wire
 I
 get


into.
 there's
 one
 utility
 I
 have
 the


option
 from.
 Sometimes
 there
 are
 these


people
 on
 the
 street
 and
 they're
 like,


"Oh,
 sign,
 will
 you
 sign
 up
 for
 clean


power
 or
 something
 like
 that
 and
 they


try
 to
 get
 me
 to
 do
 stuff,
 but
 I
 don't


really
 understand
 how
 that
 works
 because


I
 don't
 understand
 how
 electrons
 can
 be


directed
 to
 anyone's
 home."
 So,
 I'm


always
 very
 skeptical
 of
 that.
 What
 do


we
 talk
 about
 when
 people
 talk
 about
 a


competitive
 market?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 think
 of
 the
 electricity


system
 as
 sort
 of
 a
 chain
 of
 links.


Upstream
 you've
 got
 the
 power
 generators


and
 then
 after
 that
 you've
 got
 the
 high


voltage
 transmission
 system.
 It
 patches


into
 a
 substation
 that
 steps
 down
 the


voltage
 to
 a
 lower
 level.
 That's
 what
 we


would
 call
 the
 distribution
 system.
 And


then
 there's
 a
 meter
 hanging
 on
 the
 side


of
 your
 home
 and
 beyond
 that
 meter
 you


are
 the
 consumer
 of
 electricity.
 The


most
 upstream
 the
 generation
 and
 the


most
 downstream
 retailing
 have
 been


opened
 in
 some
 states
 to
 competition.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 fairly
 intuitive
 what


that
 means
 for
 generation.
 Power
 plants


are
 owned
 by
 private
 investors
 who
 make


investments
 in
 them.
 Those
 power
 plants


compete
 against
 one
 another
 in
 auctions


for
 electricity
 and
 sell
 their
 power
 to


wholesale
 offtakers.
 Some
 of
 those


offtakers
 then
 are
 the
 retailers
 of


electricity
 who
 sort
 of
 buy
 an
 upstream


supply
 of
 goods
 and
 then
 use
 the


regulated
 poles
 and
 wires
 and
 pay


regulated
 rates
 to
 deliver
 that


commodity
 to
 you
 at
 your
 home.
 So
 some


of
 the
 value
 proposition
 of
 what
 you're


experiencing
 as
 a
 potential
 retail


customer
 in
 a
 competitive
 market
 is
 your


product
 selection.
 I
 mean,
 to
 give
 an


example,
 a
 retailer
 came
 to
 me
 and


marketed
 me
 a
 5-year
 fixed
 price
 for


electricity
 last
 year.
 I
 bought
 it.
 I


locked
 in
 a
 rate.
 I'm
 insulated
 from


upstream,
 you
 know,
 changes
 in
 wholesale


market
 volatility
 as
 a
 result.
 That's


generally
 the
 value
 proposition
 of


competitive
 retail.
 Though,
 in
 places


like
 Texas,
 you're
 also
 seeing
 product


differentiation
 that
 has
 a
 ring
 of


telecommunications
 and
 data
 competition.


sort
 of
 like
 more
 apps
 as
 part
 of
 your


retail
 electric
 supply
 service.
 People


selling
 you
 smart
 thermostats
 or


residential
 batteries
 that
 can
 be


packaged
 onto
 your
 retail
 electricity


supply
 plan
 to
 sell
 back
 to
 the
 grid,


help
 manage
 your
 costs
 upstream
 to


stabilize
 pricing.
 But
 that's
 the


paradigm
 of
 competition
 in
 this
 space.


It's
 a
 regulated
 system
 in
 the
 middle


with
 competition
 on
 the
 edges.


Can
 we
 back
 up
 for
 a
 second
 and
 go
 back


to
 that
 big
 restructuring
 of
 the
 market


because
 I
 have
 a
 feeling
 this
 will
 help


us
 understand
 our
 current
 situation.
 But


what
 was
 the
 problem
 that
 we
 were
 trying


to
 solve
 back
 then?
 You
 know,
 people


have
 short
 memories.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


would
 say
 that
 our
 electricity
 system


right
 now
 has
 its
 own
 special
 problems


and
 they
 would
 forget
 that
 there
 were


previous
 problems
 that
 this
 system
 was


meant
 to
 address.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 kind
 of
 haunting.


It's
 funny
 you
 should
 ask
 that
 question


because
 the
 problem
 it
 was
 meant
 to


address
 is
 that
 regulated
 utilities


which
 used
 to
 own
 this
 whole
 chain
 of


links
 on
 a
 consolidated
 vertically


integrated
 basis
 bet
 wrong
 very
 badly
 on


the
 amount
 of
 demand
 growth
 in
 the


sector.
 and
 they
 put
 themselves
 out


there
 building
 power
 plants
 that
 were


intended
 to
 be
 included
 in
 what's
 called


their
 rate
 base
 on
 which
 they
 earn
 a


return
 and
 are
 able
 to
 charge
 off
 those


costs
 to
 a
 captive
 set
 of
 customers.


When
 they
 bet
 wrong
 on
 the
 demand
 that


would
 ultimately
 materialize
 on
 the


system,
 they
 found
 themselves
 well
 over


their
 skis
 in
 the
 amount
 of
 power


generation
 that
 they
 either
 had
 built
 or


were
 in
 the
 process
 of
 building.
 At
 the


heart
 of
 regulated
 utility
 economics
 is


this
 division
 problem
 where
 kind
 of
 a


total
 system
 of
 fixed
 costs
 is
 the


numerator
 divided
 by
 the
 denominator
 of


throughput.
 So
 these
 regulated
 utilities


were
 adding
 handsomely
 to
 the
 numerator.


The
 denominator
 wasn't
 propping
 up
 that


and
 the
 result
 was
 that
 division
 problem


spitting
 out
 a
 price
 that
 was
 escalating


higher
 and
 higher.
 Some
 utilities
 at


that
 point
 their
 state
 regulators
 said


you've
 been
 imprudent.
 we're
 going
 to


not
 allow
 you
 cost
 recovery
 because


you've
 been
 imprudent.
 They
 went


bankrupt.
 But
 that
 was
 the
 exception
 to


the
 rule.
 Most
 of
 them
 allowed
 those


costs
 to
 be
 recovered
 from
 a
 captive


customer
 base.
 But
 some
 of
 those
 states


also
 passed
 laws
 that
 said,
 "Let's
 never


do
 this
 again.
 There's
 no
 reason
 why
 we


shouldn't
 have
 power
 generation
 invested


in
 to
 meet
 the
 levels
 of
 demand
 needed


on
 the
 system
 be
 a
 function
 of
 investors


competitive
 bets
 in
 the
 market.
 And
 so


in
 about
 you
 know
 call
 it
 a
 third
 of
 the


states
 but
 accounting
 for
 more
 than
 half


of
 the
 power
 sold
 that's
 now
 the


business
 model
 where
 companies
 like
 mine


are
 you
 know
 have
 to
 make
 guesses
 about


what
 the
 demand
 is
 going
 to
 be
 and
 try


to
 voluntarily


contract
 with
 us
 to
 produce
 revenue
 for


the
 power
 generation
 we
 might
 invest
 in.


And
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 country,
 it


still
 works
 by,
 you
 know,
 people
 like
 me


wearing
 my
 former
 hat,
 you
 know,
 as
 a
 as


the
 chairman
 of
 a
 utility
 commission,


like
 guessing
 what
 the
 future
 is
 going


to
 be
 and
 charging
 off
 the
 cost
 of
 those


gases
 to
 a
 monopolized
 customer
 base.


[music]


[music]


>> [music]


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 your
 former
 hat
 because


one
 of the
 things
 you
 hear
 about
 is
 that


the
 utilities
 have
 this
 incentive
 to


overinvest
 because
 that
 might
 help


determine
 what
 they're
 allowed
 to
 charge


on
 a
 going
 forward
 basis.
 But
 why
 don't


you
 sort
 of
 talk
 about
 your
 former
 hat


and
 the
 basic
 role
 you
 played,
 how
 you


thought
 about
 decision
 making
 and
 how
 we


are
 to
 understand
 what
 the
 world
 looks


like
 from
 the
 standpoint
 of
 someone


sitting
 on
 that
 regulatory
 commission.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 you're
 number
 one,
 you're


absolutely
 correct
 about
 the
 incentives


at
 play
 under
 the
 style
 of
 economic


regulation
 that
 is
 widely
 used
 really


without
 exception
 in
 the
 United
 States


to
 regulate
 the
 monopoly
 industries
 in


the
 utility
 sector.
 The
 companies
 earn
 a


return
 that
 is
 sort
 of
 announced
 in


advanced
 by
 their
 state
 or
 federal


economic
 regulators
 based
 on
 the
 amount


of
 capital
 they've
 invested
 in
 the


system.
 So
 spend
 more
 make
 more
 has
 some


paradoxical
 effects
 where
 the
 most


amount
 of
 profit
 a
 utility
 will
 ever


make
 is
 in
 the
 first
 year
 that
 it
 owns
 a


particular
 asset
 and
 then
 when
 they
 own


it
 free
 and
 clear
 they
 actually
 earn


zero
 profit.
 So
 sort
 of
 an
 inversion


[laughter]
 of
 the
 cash
 flow
 paradigm


that
 you
 would
 expect
 out
 of
 competitive


businesses.
 Regulators
 also
 establish


the
 depreciation
 lifespan
 for
 ratem


purposes
 of
 regulated
 assets
 which
 has


some
 interactive
 effects
 with
 that


model.
 So
 that
 that's
 basically
 the


gristin
 mill
 of
 what
 state
 regulatory


utility
 commissions
 do.
 They
 determine


the
 amount
 that
 is
 quote
 unquote
 used


and
 useful
 in
 service
 to
 customers
 of


the
 capital
 investments
 that
 utilities


have
 made.
 They
 also
 establish
 an


allowance
 for
 so-called
 prudently


incurred
 expenses
 the
 on&m
 on
 the
 system


around
 which
 the
 utility
 earns
 no
 margin


just
 gets
 a
 recovery
 of
 those
 costs.
 And


that
 that
 also
 has
 the
 knock-on


incentive
 of
 if
 I'm
 a
 utility
 and
 I
 look


at
 a
 problem
 that
 I
 have
 to
 solve,
 I'll


always
 want
 to
 solve
 it
 with
 capital


investment.
 I
 will
 never
 want
 to
 solve


it
 with
 opex,
 you
 know,
 and
 because
 that


one
 earns
 a
 return,
 one
 does
 not.
 So


ordinary
 tradeoffs
 that
 would
 occur
 in


competitive
 businesses
 between
 capex
 and


opex
 tend
 not
 to
 occur
 in
 the
 regulated


sector.
 Other
 countries
 have
 done
 this
 a


different
 way
 and
 have
 tried
 to


establish
 more
 of
 a
 performance-based


framework
 of
 regulation
 that
 rewards


utilities
 with
 profits
 based
 on


outcomes.
 But,
 you
 know,
 the
 United


States
 has
 never
 got
 there
 for
 a
 whole


variety
 of
 frankly
 dumb
 reasons.
 So,


that's
 the
 way
 the
 sector
 is
 regulated.


It's
 it's
 weird
 to
 have
 a
 sector
 that
 is


really
 regulated
 according
 to
 early
 20th


c
 century
 standards
 that's
 trying
 to


serve
 a
 modern
 economy
 to
 be
 fully


candid
 with
 you.
 Yeah,
 it
 does
 feel
 that


way,
 doesn't
 it?
 So,
 again,
 I
 said
 in


the
 intro,
 I
 do
 not
 know
 much
 about
 the


electricity
 market.
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm


constantly
 struggling
 to
 try
 to


understand
 it.
 But
 one
 thing
 I
 do
 know


is
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 electricity


companies
 seem
 to
 complain
 for
 years
 and


years
 and
 years
 that
 loads
 in
 the
 US
 had


actually
 been
 either
 declining
 or


stagnant.
 Now,
 we
 have
 the
 situation


where
 everyone
 is
 talking
 about
 data


centers
 coming
 on
 stream
 and
 use
 a
 lot


of
 electricity.
 So,
 loads
 are
 finally


rising.
 Shouldn't
 this
 be
 a
 good
 thing


for
 the
 electricity
 company?
 Shouldn't


they
 be
 celebrating
 they
 have
 extra


money
 um
 to
 spend
 on
 if
 not
 opex
 than


capex?


>> Generally,
 yes.
 And
 it's
 true
 that
 for


most
 electricity
 markets
 in
 the
 United


States,
 it's
 been
 fairly
 flat.
 In
 the


PJM,
 the
 Pennsylvania,
 New
 Jersey,


Maryland
 market
 that
 stretches
 from


Washington
 DC
 to
 Chicago.
 They
 last


recorded
 a
 record
 peak
 demand
 in
 2006.


They'll
 in
 all
 likelihood
 set
 a
 new


demand
 next
 year,
 20
 years
 later
 in


2026.
 Some
 markets
 like
 Texas's
 Urkott


market
 have
 been
 growing,
 but
 it
 is


definitely
 the
 exception
 to
 the
 rule.
 Mo


most
 of
 these
 people
 last
 set
 a
 record


demand,
 you
 know,
 before
 the
 period
 of


offshoring
 and
 de-industrialization


of
 industries
 that
 use
 a
 lot
 of


electricity
 and
 and
 that
 actually


facilitated
 the
 kind
 of
 turnover
 of


capital
 from
 coal
 gas
 and
 to
 renewables


a
 little
 bit
 as
 well
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 these


places.
 But
 net
 of
 net,
 you
 know,
 that


was
 kind
 of
 neutral
 or
 even
 a
 little
 bit


negative
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 total
 installed


generation
 capacity.
 who
 was
 kind
 of


managing
 to
 even
 in
 terms
 of
 generation


capacity
 additions.
 And
 then
 in
 terms
 of


like
 shouldn't
 they
 be
 celebrating?
 Yes,


definitely.
 Everyone
 in
 the
 sector,
 my


business
 and
 the
 regulated
 utilities
 are


excited
 about
 the
 prospect
 of
 growth.


They're
 also
 nervous
 about
 whether
 or


not
 this
 growth
 is
 real
 and
 to
 what


magnitude.
 Part
 of
 what
 makes
 it
 a


little
 worrying
 is
 that
 ordinarily


electricity
 demand
 growth
 would
 be
 a


composite
 of
 growing
 demand
 from
 many


different
 enduse
 applications
 that
 would


kind
 of
 diversify
 the
 risk
 of
 betting
 on


growth.
 Here
 it's
 like
 a
 one
 or
 a
 zero.


You
 know
 if
 you
 take
 out
 the
 data


centers
 the
 sector
 is
 actually
 you
 know


pretty
 stable
 in
 terms
 of
 electricity


demand.
 If
 you
 add
 the
 data
 centers
 the


sector
 is
 really
 poised
 to
 grow
 a
 heck


of
 a
 lot.
 And
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


projections
 of
 the
 grid
 operators,
 I


mean,
 just
 to
 put
 some
 numbers
 on
 this,


the
 the
 market
 PJM
 in
 the
 Mid-Atlantic


that
 I
 was
 referring
 to,
 it's
 currently


about
 160,000
 megawatt
 market.
 It's


projecting
 to
 add
 40,000
 megawatts
 by


2030.
 The
 Urkott,
 Texas
 market,
 you


know,
 about
 85,000


megawatts
 right
 now.
 Its
 latest


projection
 is
 up
 to
 nearly
 140,000


megawws
 by
 2030.
 Now,
 that's
 like
 adding


a
 California
 to
 Texas
 in
 terms
 of


electricity
 demand
 in
 five
 years.
 And


that's
 not
 going
 to
 happen
 because
 it


can't.
 It
 just
 I
 mean,
 literally
 could


not
 occur.
 But
 there
 there
 in
 lies
 the


problem
 is
 like
 what
 are
 we
 actually


investing
 toward
 and
 what
 are
 the


regulatory
 policies
 that
 can
 essentially


help
 call
 the
 question
 on
 the
 amount
 of


offtake
 that
 will
 actually
 materialize


from
 AI
 so
 that
 then
 capital
 investments


can
 propagate
 throughout
 the
 supply


chain
 to
 to
 end
 up
 serving
 them.
 that


that's
 really
 the
 fundamental
 question


that
 policy
 makers,
 utilities,
 and


competitive
 providers
 like
 us
 are
 trying


to
 deal
 with.


>> Those
 numbers
 are
 absolutely
 staggering.


The
 idea
 of
 adding
 California
 size


demand
 to
 Texas
 in
 just
 a
 standpoint
 of


a
 few
 years.
 When
 you
 say
 you
 don't


think
 those
 numbers
 can
 happen,
 what
 is


the
 constraint?
 Is
 it
 on
 the
 generation


side
 in
 a
 market
 like
 Texas
 or
 if
 we're


talking
 about
 what
 any
 other
 region
 or


because
 I
 think
 there
 it's
 pretty
 easy


to
 set
 up,
 you
 know,
 solar
 farms
 or


whatever.
 Texas
 seems
 pretty
 liberal


with
 what
 kind
 of
 how
 easy
 it
 is
 to
 plug


into
 the
 grid
 or
 is
 it
 in
 a
 state
 like


that
 there
 isn't
 the
 transmission


capacity
 even
 if
 you
 can
 stand
 up
 the


production?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 I
 mean
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


everything.
 everything
 from
 stuff
 that


isn't,
 you
 know,
 on
 the
 power
 sector


side
 of
 the
 fence
 line
 in
 terms
 of


actually
 being
 able
 to
 construct
 data


centers
 and,
 you
 know,
 their
 chips
 and


the
 fiber
 optics
 that
 would
 back
 them


up.
 And
 then
 on
 our
 side
 of
 the
 fence,


you're
 right,
 getting
 access
 to
 the
 grid


through
 interconnection,
 getting
 all
 the


equipment
 that
 you
 would
 need
 to
 tap


into
 the
 grid.
 We're
 talking
 about,
 you


know,
 kind
 of
 grid
 step
 up
 generator


stepup
 transformers
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.


Joe,
 I
 know
 that's
 a
 topic
 near
 and
 dear


to
 you
 from
 listening
 to
 the
 pod
 over


the
 years.
 And
 then
 it
 is
 the
 power


equipment
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 gas
 turbine


availability.
 You
 know,
 solar
 panels


probably
 aren't
 going
 to
 do
 it
 for
 you


given
 the
 demand
 for,
 you
 know,
 kind
 of


consistent
 power
 production
 off
 of
 these


data
 centers,
 but
 they
 are
 helpful.
 So,


it's
 just
 the
 magnitude
 there
 is
 a


dilemma.
 And
 you
 know
 right
 now
 if
 I


were
 to
 place
 an
 order
 for
 something


like
 you
 know
 a
 generator
 step-up


transformer
 you
 know
 precoid
 it
 would


have
 been
 maybe
 like
 12
 to
 18
 months.


Now
 we're
 talking
 about
 3
 to
 4
 years
 for


a
 bespoke
 piece
 of
 equipment
 whose


specifications
 are
 only
 available
 to
 me


after
 the
 local
 utility
 the
 poles
 and


wires
 company
 tells
 me
 what
 my


interconnection
 study
 looks
 like
 in


terms
 of
 grid
 availability
 and
 our


connection
 to
 the
 system.
 So
 that
 that's


one.
 You
 know,
 NRG
 is
 lucky
 enough
 to


have
 some
 gas
 turbines
 lined
 up
 for


delivery,
 you
 know,
 later
 in
 this


decade.
 So
 we
 would
 be
 able
 to


facilitate
 some
 of
 this
 investment.
 But


if
 you
 were
 going
 to
 get
 in
 line
 right


now,
 that
 too
 would
 be
 a
 process
 that


would
 take
 several
 years.
 Some
 of
 it's


the
 availability
 of
 equipment
 and
 some


of
 it
 is
 a
 natural
 pacing
 of
 steps
 in


the
 kind
 of
 quasi
 regulatory
 process
 to


get
 projects
 online.
 It
 would
 be
 better.


I
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the
 interesting
 policy


innovations
 that's
 out
 there
 is
 if
 you


had
 kind
 of
 more
 of
 a
 market
 to
 make
 use


of
 the
 scarce
 remaining
 headroom
 in
 our


system
 from
 sort
 of
 a
 grid


interconnection
 point
 of
 view
 without


tripping
 into
 having
 to
 build
 a
 bunch
 of


capital
 investments
 in
 poles
 and
 wires.


But
 you
 know
 that's
 not
 the
 way
 the


regulatory
 model
 is
 set
 up.
 You
 know


right
 now
 we
 have
 a
 paradigm
 where
 if


I'm
 a
 power
 generator
 I
 kind
 of
 knock
 on


the
 door
 of
 the
 local
 utility
 and
 say


hey
 you
 know
 I
 want
 to
 build
 a
 power


project
 at
 this
 place
 can
 you
 s
 can
 you


study
 it
 for
 the
 sake
 of
 its


interconnection
 to
 the
 grid
 they
 come


back
 with
 the
 study
 and
 I
 don't
 like
 the


number
 I
 don't
 like
 the
 specs
 and
 then
 I


submit
 another
 study
 and
 we
 iterate.
 Um,


so
 it's
 a
 time-consuming
 process


sometimes
 to
 develop
 these
 projects
 and


there
 probably
 needs
 to
 be
 avenues
 that


are
 more
 coordinated
 between
 the
 demand


and
 supply
 side.
 And
 even
 if
 you
 don't,


you
 know,
 even
 if
 you
 certainly


shouldn't
 functionally
 reintegrate
 the


utility
 business
 model,
 but
 there
 does


need
 to
 be
 more
 coordination
 between
 the


people
 who
 own
 the
 poles
 and
 wires
 and


the
 people
 who
 are
 doing
 the
 generation.


And
 that's
 kind
 of
 a
 missing
 link
 right


now
 in
 this
 policy
 landscape.


>> Other
 than
 sheer
 volume
 of
 power
 needs,


I
 guess
 sheer
 megawws.
 Do
 data
 centers


have
 specific
 energy
 needs
 in
 terms
 of
 I


don't
 know
 the
 type
 of
 electricity?
 I


would
 assume
 a
 megawatt
 is
 a
 megawatt,


but
 what
 do
 I
 know?
 But
 maybe
 in
 terms


of
 timing
 and
 things
 like
 that,
 are


there
 sort
 of
 operational
 considerations


that
 are
 unique
 to
 data
 centers


electricity
 consumption
 versus
 say
 an


industrial
 factory
 or
 us
 turning
 the


lights
 on
 when
 we
 get
 home?


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 mean
 the
 first
 experience
 you


know
 at
 any
 scale
 that
 anyone
 seemed
 to


have
 with
 computing
 technologies
 you


know
 were
 kind
 of
 you
 know
 cloud-based


servers
 and
 then
 really
 on
 the
 other


side
 like
 crypto
 mining
 facilities
 and


both
 of
 them
 data
 centers
 but
 the
 two


could
 not
 be
 more
 different
 right
 I
 mean


c
 crypto
 can
 it
 becomes
 uneconomic
 at
 a


certain
 strike
 price
 for
 cryptocurrency


to
 continue
 mining
 and
 so
 it's
 a
 highly


flexible
 load
 that
 drops
 off
 the
 system


when
 conditions
 become
 tight
 in
 an


electricity
 market
 and
 we
 see
 that
 all


the
 time
 in
 Texas.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,


for
 you
 know
 cloud
 services
 that
 are


providing
 kind
 of
 real
 time


instantaneous
 hosting
 capabilities
 you


know
 they
 they
 kind
 of
 need
 they
 have
 a


very
 high
 what's
 called
 a
 load
 factor
 of


their
 power
 consumption.
 They're
 drawing


from
 the
 system
 on
 a
 relatively


consistent
 basis
 and
 of
 course
 they
 need


to
 be
 highly
 reliable.
 you
 know
 they


can't
 really
 be
 interrupted
 without


having
 cloudfare
 or
 AWS
 interruption


style
 problems.
 So
 very
 different
 and


you
 can
 look
 back
 to
 analoges
 of
 you


know
 other
 industrial
 customers
 you
 know


aluminum
 smelters
 highloadad
 factor
 when


they
 were
 doing
 the
 batching
 of
 smelting


couldn't
 be
 interrupted
 paper
 mills


maybe
 you
 could
 interrupt
 them.
 So
 we


the
 industry
 has
 some
 like
 kind
 of


learnings
 from
 this
 and
 there
 have
 been


markets
 designed
 around
 the
 flexibility


of
 demand
 to
 try
 to
 do
 for
 the
 power


sector
 what
 previously
 happened
 to
 say


the
 airline
 sector
 which
 had
 used
 to


have
 you
 know
 very
 low
 load
 factor
 and


then
 after
 restructuring
 and


deregulation
 in
 the
 70s
 suddenly


everyone's
 you
 know
 everyone's
 airplanes


ended
 up
 full
 you
 know
 and
 too
 full
 in


some
 cases
 where
 you
 know
 people
 get


bumped
 and
 compensated
 for
 it.
 So
 we're


we've
 yet
 to
 achieve
 that
 though
 in
 the


power
 sector
 where
 load
 factors
 continue


to
 be
 you
 know
 50
 60
 70%.
 So
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 headroom
 during
 certain
 hours
 and


very
 little
 headroom
 during
 other
 hours.


So
 the
 kind
 of
 the
 primary
 question
 in


terms
 of
 the
 network
 economics
 is
 if
 you


end
 up
 with
 a
 bunch
 of
 high
 load
 factor


data
 center
 customers,
 the
 type
 that


can't
 be
 interrupted,
 how
 do
 you
 get


them
 online
 without
 tripping
 into
 a


bunch
 of
 necessary
 capital
 investments


to
 serve
 that
 last
 few%
 of
 hours
 where


their
 demand
 needs
 to
 be
 served
 and


firm?
 Or
 can
 you
 source
 flexibility
 out


of
 the
 system
 somewhere
 else
 like
 from


residential
 air
 conditioning
 or


something
 like
 that?
 That's
 a
 question


again
 that's
 very
 important
 to
 figure


out.
 People
 have
 kind
 of
 issue
 spotted


it
 but
 we've
 really
 yet
 to
 solve
 in
 any


meaningful
 way.
 Though
 markets
 like


Texas
 are
 kind
 of
 geared
 towards
 solving


it
 in
 more
 of
 a
 free
 enterprise
 [music]


premise.
 Other
 markets
 seem
 to
 be


struggling
 a
 bit.


[music]


[music]


It's
 funny
 to
 think
 about
 getting
 an


alert
 on
 your
 phone.
 It's
 like
 GPT6
 is


completing
 its
 training
 run.
 Sorry.
 No,


if
 we
 would
 like
 you
 to
 turn
 down
 your


air
 conditioning
 right
 now.
 No,
 I
 don't


know if
 that
 would
 happen.
 But
 the
 part


of
 the
 reason
 everyone's
 interested
 in


data
 centers
 period,
 well,
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 reasons,
 but
 people
 are
 worried
 when


they
 hear
 these
 numbers,
 they're
 like,


"Oh,
 am
 I
 as
 the
 consumer,
 let's
 say
 I


lived
 in
 Texas,
 which
 I
 sometimes
 have,


am
 I
 as
 the
 consumer
 going
 to
 in
 some


way
 or
 another
 be
 paying
 the
 price
 for


this
 massive
 expansion
 of
 demand
 thanks


to
 data
 centers?"
 Intuitively,
 it
 seems


like,
 well,
 it
 shouldn't
 be.
 They
 could


pay
 for
 their
 own
 electricity.
 They


could
 pay
 for
 their
 own
 upgrades.
 But


how
 does
 this
 massive
 increase
 in
 demand


play
 out
 from
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 rateayer


perspective?


>> Yeah.
 So
 we
 go
 back
 to
 the
 kind
 of


segmentation
 between
 the
 regulated
 grid


costs
 and
 the
 commodity
 costs
 on
 on
 in


answer
 to
 that
 question
 on
 the
 commodity


side.
 You
 know,
 this
 tends
 to
 be
 a


marginal
 cost
 pricing
 environment
 where


if
 you
 have
 demand


growth
 outstripping
 supply
 additions,


the
 system
 becomes
 tighter.
 The
 supply


curve
 moves
 up
 for
 the
 kind
 of
 last
 unit


that's
 necessary
 to
 serve
 demand
 and
 its


marginal
 costs
 in
 a
 very
 real
 way


establish
 the
 clearing
 price
 that
 all


demand
 has
 to
 pay.
 Unless
 and
 to
 the


extent
 to
 they
 are
 bilaterally


contracted
 with
 some
 kind
 of
 hedging


instruments
 which
 everyone
 should
 be.
 No


one
 should
 be
 in
 an
 ideal
 market
 exposed


to
 that
 spot
 price
 but
 we
 find
 that
 many


people
 are
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 reasons.
 So


some
 policy
 interventions
 that
 people


have
 contemplated
 is
 you
 know
 usually
 we


would
 let
 these
 markets
 kind
 of


equilibriate
 on
 their
 own.
 we
 would


expect
 sort
 of
 organic
 growth
 to
 be
 met


with
 organic
 supply
 additions.
 Here


people
 have
 observed
 like
 wow
 this


demand
 growth
 seems
 really
 out
 of
 scale


with
 what
 the
 markets
 have
 organically


been
 able
 to
 achieve.
 Maybe
 we
 should


have
 a
 requirement
 to
 just
 bring
 your


own
 generation.
 you
 know,
 we're
 not


going
 to
 let
 the
 power
 markets
 on
 a


forward
 traded
 basis
 send
 the
 right


signal
 and
 hope
 that
 enough
 generation


shows
 up
 to
 serve
 this
 demand
 a
 as
 sort


of
 part
 of
 the
 social
 license
 or
 even
 a


formalized
 regulatory
 requirement
 for


them
 to
 get
 online.
 You
 got
 to
 show
 us


the
 megawatts
 that
 you're
 bringing
 out


of
 the
 system.
 So
 that's
 one
 of
 the


debates.
 On
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the


ledger,
 the
 regulated
 costs
 that
 too
 can


be
 a
 problem
 usually
 in
 again
 this


division
 problem
 of
 network
 economics


for
 the
 regulated
 costs.
 If
 you're


adding
 to
 that
 denominator
 of
 throughput


at
 a
 rate
 that
 is
 higher,
 then
 you're


adding
 two
 additions
 to
 the
 fixed
 cost


of
 the
 system,
 everyone's
 rates
 go
 down.


You
 know,
 produces
 a
 lower
 quotient,


which
 is
 the
 price
 of
 grid
 consumed


electricity.
 The
 problem
 here
 is
 that
 in


a
 kind
 of
 an
 inflationary
 environment


for
 all
 the
 materials,
 the
 transformers,


the
 cabling,
 everything
 that
 goes
 into


the
 poles
 and
 wires,
 if
 you're
 adding


demand
 and
 you're
 not
 just
 using


headroom
 that
 already
 exists
 on
 the


system,
 if
 you're
 not
 increasing
 that


capacity
 factor
 on
 the
 system,
 if
 you're


tripping
 into
 a
 lot
 of
 new
 capital


expenditures,
 then
 even
 if
 you're
 adding


demand
 that's
 paying
 regulated
 rates,
 it


may
 not
 be
 enough
 to
 offset
 the
 total


amount
 of
 expenditures
 incrementally


you're
 making
 on
 the
 system.
 So
 there's


policy
 interventions
 there
 too
 where
 you


can
 try
 to
 directly
 assign
 the
 costs


that
 are
 caused
 on
 the
 grid
 back
 to
 the


data
 centers.
 But
 those
 are
 pretty
 nent


approaches
 and
 some
 of
 the
 ones
 that


have
 been
 tried
 are
 kind
 of
 aiming
 at


the
 wrong
 thing.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 policy
 work


remains
 to
 be
 done
 here
 and
 all
 of
 this


is
 kind
 of
 a
 political
 debate
 where
 you


know
 a
 lot
 of
 state
 governors
 the
 people


who
 are
 really
 the
 ones
 kind
 of
 in


charge
 of
 you
 know
 with
 their
 state


utility
 commissions
 setting
 these


policies
 they
 simultaneously
 want
 the


economic
 development
 of
 data
 centers
 but


they
 don't
 want
 any
 negative


externalities
 around
 reliability


affordability
 clean
 energy
 and
 all
 those


things
 trade
 off
 against
 one
 another
 but


you
 know
 political
 actors
 will
 want
 to


maximize
 all
 of
 those
 variables.


which
 is
 not
 possible
 in
 the
 current


environment.


>> Can
 I
 ask
 a
 very
 basic
 question?
 And
 I'm


struggling
 to
 think
 of
 a
 way
 to
 frame
 it


that
 doesn't
 sound
 like
 I've
 just
 taken


an
 elderly
 family
 member
 to
 a
 medical


office
 or
 something.
 But
 what
 is
 a
 node?


>> A
 node
 usually
 would
 be
 a
 place
 like
 a


substation.
 It
 is
 the
 place
 on
 the


physical
 grid
 at
 which
 electricity
 is


bought
 and
 sold.
 It's
 a
 physical


destination
 on
 the
 grid.
 When
 we
 say


nodal
 markets,
 uh,
 which
 is
 a
 way
 to


describe
 electricity
 markets,
 we're


referring
 to
 markets
 where
 electricity


is
 priced
 on
 a
 so-called
 locationational


marginal
 price
 basis.
 And
 the
 L
 the


LMPs,
 as
 they're
 called,
 are
 based
 on


physical
 destinations
 on
 the
 grid
 called


nodes.
 I'm
 just,
 you
 know,
 estimated


guess
 here,
 but
 a
 market
 like
 Texas
 will


have
 a
 few
 thousand
 nodes
 at
 which


electricity
 is
 traded
 on
 an
 individuated


price
 basis.


>> That
 seems
 like
 such
 a
 weird
 way
 of


doing
 it
 to
 me.
 And
 I'm
 sure
 there
 are


very
 valid
 reasons
 for
 doing
 it
 in
 this


way.
 But
 like
 nowadays,
 given
 all
 the


data
 at
 our
 disposal,
 given
 the
 rise
 of


AI,
 can't
 we
 work
 out
 some
 sort
 of


average
 cost
 across
 the
 system?
 It
 seems


really
 weird
 that
 we're
 taking
 it
 at


like
 physical
 points.
 Although
 I
 guess


you
 know
 there
 are
 plenty
 of
 commodities


that
 do
 trade
 based
 on
 particular


locations,
 but
 it
 just
 seems
 strange
 to


me.


>> Well,
 it
 is
 important
 that
 you
 have


nodal
 pricing
 in
 the
 system
 o
 only


because
 it
 sends
 a
 powerful
 price
 signal


for
 the
 accurate
 location
 of
 necessary


power
 generation.
 There
 are
 certain


markets,
 I'm
 thinking
 of
 Alberta,
 some


of
 the
 European
 markets
 that
 actually
 do


establish
 a
 zonal
 price
 across
 their


entire
 market.
 But
 there
 you
 end
 up
 with


power
 plant
 developers,
 you
 know,
 who


develop
 wind
 in
 a
 particular
 area
 far


away
 from
 demand
 to
 capture
 the
 average


price,
 but
 then
 that
 energy
 ends
 up


being
 undeliverable
 because
 there
 are


transmission
 system
 constraints
 and


congestion.
 So
 the
 nodal
 pricing


formulation
 is
 intended
 to
 reflect
 a


market
 that
 unlike
 the
 stock
 exchange


isn't
 just
 trading
 bits
 of
 data
 to


represent
 kind
 of
 paper
 securities.
 It


in
 a
 very
 real
 way
 is
 meant
 to
 simulate


a
 kind
 of
 flow
 of
 electrons
 on
 a
 system


constrained
 basis.
 And
 then
 it
 provides


valuable
 information
 too
 because
 if
 you


continue
 to
 see
 locationational
 marginal


prices,
 you
 know,
 in
 one
 place
 that
 are


very
 high
 and
 20
 miles
 away
 they're
 very


low.
 That's
 a
 signal
 to
 the
 people
 who


plan
 the
 transmission
 grid
 that
 hey,
 you


know,
 we
 should
 probably
 build
 a


transmission
 line
 here
 because
 the


addition
 of
 the
 transmission
 line
 will


be
 the
 thing
 that
 flattens
 out
 that


price
 differential
 and
 creates
 a
 market


that
 looks
 more
 like
 a,
 you
 know,
 a


copper
 plate
 rather
 than
 two
 separate


swimming
 pools.


>> Interesting.
 Just
 to
 be
 clear
 though,
 if


I
 wanted
 to
 be
 public
 enemy
 number
 one,


could
 I
 build
 a
 gigantic
 data
 center


next
 to
 a
 locationational
 marginal
 price


point
 node
 and
 affect
 the
 cost
 of


electricity
 for,
 you
 know,
 a
 greater


area?


>> Yes,
 you
 absolutely
 could.
 And
 in
 fact,


I
 mean,
 I
 know
 of
 at
 least
 one
 example.


You
 know,
 North
 Dakota
 is
 actually
 a


good
 example
 of
 this.
 A
 place
 that
 is


doesn't
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 robust


transmission
 infrastructure
 does
 have
 a


lot
 of
 renewable
 resources
 that
 cause


and
 those
 renewables
 are
 almost
 kind
 of


dumping
 on
 the
 market
 in
 a
 way
 that


causes
 the
 energy
 price
 to
 go
 down
 and


even
 negative
 at
 times
 in
 North
 Dakota.


And
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 the
 first
 data


centers
 that
 we've
 seen
 in
 this
 wave
 of


expansion
 chose
 to
 locate
 in
 North


Dakota
 because
 they
 had
 access
 to


wholesale
 prices
 that
 were
 low
 or


negative.
 they
 were
 just
 following
 the


price
 signal.
 And
 so
 there's,
 you
 know,


there's
 certain
 data
 centers
 out
 there


that
 are
 literally
 being
 paid
 to
 consume


electricity
 because
 there's
 such
 an
 over


supply
 and
 so
 little
 transmission
 into


the
 area.


>> I,
 you
 know,
 I
 got
 asked
 this
 question


on
 a
 podcast
 recently
 and
 I
 didn't
 have


a
 good
 answer
 and
 I
 so
 now
 I
 want
 to


ask.
 So
 you
 mentioned,
 okay,
 all
 these


different
 pieces
 of
 electrical
 gear,


they're
 in
 short
 supply.
 You
 might
 not


be
 able
 to
 get
 some
 key
 equipment
 until


2030.
 Is
 that
 strain
 going
 to
 ease
 at


all?
 Is
 there
 any
 additional
 capacity


coming
 on
 the
 market?
 When
 I
 was
 asked


this,
 I
 like
 sort
 of
 like
 hesitated.
 I


was
 like,
 well,
 maybe
 they're
 not
 sure


about
 the
 future,
 so
 they're
 like


reluctant
 to
 do
 the
 capital
 expending


involved.
 But
 do
 you
 think
 there's
 any


like
 is
 capacity
 growing
 for
 some
 of


this
 core
 infrastructure?
 As
 far
 as
 you


could
 tell,


>> my
 impression
 is
 yes.
 I
 mean,
 you've


seen
 public
 announcements
 from
 the


largest
 gas
 turbine
 manufacturer,
 GE


Vernova,
 about
 new
 manufacturing
 base


additions.
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 the


transformer
 equipment
 as
 well.
 I
 think


you're
 seeing
 some
 incremental


investment
 in
 you're
 certainly
 seeing


power
 generators
 like
 NRG,
 you
 know,


take
 positions
 in
 lining
 up
 their


optionality
 to
 have
 power
 projects
 that


can
 be
 deployable
 to
 either
 the
 Texas


market
 or
 the
 Mid-Atlantic
 market


depending
 on
 where
 consumer
 demand


actually
 arises.
 So,
 I
 I
 I
 think
 there


is
 some
 development
 in
 that
 market.
 I
 I


will
 say
 I
 think
 what
 people
 are
 waiting


for
 you
 know
 everyone
 looks
 around
 the


supply
 chain
 and
 you
 know
 is
 reasonably


asking
 well
 who's
 got
 the
 deep
 pockets


here
 and
 then
 everyone
 turns
 to
 big
 tech


you
 know
 big
 tech
 obviously
 if
 they


signed
 a
 power
 purchase
 agreement
 for
 15


years
 or
 even
 less
 to
 take
 power
 at
 a


certain
 price
 some
 of
 this
 supply
 chain


would
 fall
 into
 place
 pretty
 readily
 I


would
 say
 and
 so
 people
 are
 kind
 of


waiting
 in
 a
 sense
 for
 big
 tech
 to
 make


those
 big
 bilateral
 contracting
 moves


that
 would
 serve
 to
 propagate
 uh
 sort
 of


rationality
 around
 response
 to
 the


perceived
 demand
 up
 and
 down
 the
 supply


chain.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 the


leading
 indicator
 to
 watch
 for
 in
 the


sector.
 How
 many
 of
 those
 contracts
 are


actually
 being
 signed?


>> Big
 tech
 is
 just
 going
 to
 do
 everything.


They're
 going
 to
 build
 nuclear
 plants


and
 they're
 going
 to
 build
 their
 own


chips
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 build
 their


own
 fabs
 and
 everything.
 It'll
 be
 this


entire
 ecosystem
 that
 is
 just
 alphabets


from
 down
 the
 line.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back


though
 to
 something
 you
 said
 which
 is


that
 part
 of
 what's
 tricky
 about
 the


data
 center
 thing
 is
 that
 okay
 here's


this
 big
 boom
 in
 demand
 but
 it's
 not


because
 of
 like
 general
 like
 trend


economic
 growth
 and
 you
 could
 be
 perhaps


that
 in
 a
 year
 from
 now
 or
 6
 months
 from


now
 or
 tomorrow
 people
 say
 oh
 that
 I


want
 to
 slam
 the
 brakes
 on
 a
 AI
 spending


we're
 not
 getting
 this
 return
 fears
 of
 a


bubble
 you
 know
 forth
 talk
 to
 us
 a


little
 bit
 more
 how
 the
 commissions
 are


dealing
 with
 this
 risk
 and
 this
 very


Yeah.
 Binary
 state
 of
 planning.


>> Yeah.
 So
 commissions
 at
 the
 state
 level


have
 dealt
 with
 this
 in
 a
 very
 different


way.
 Some
 of
 them
 have
 candidly
 and


regulated
 utilities
 themselves
 have
 said


we
 want
 no
 part
 of
 this
 risk.
 Like
 we're


a
 small
 midcap
 utility
 and
 someone
 is


knocking
 at
 our
 door
 asking
 us
 to
 invest


in
 power
 generation.
 That
 would
 be
 like


a
 third
 of
 our
 total
 existing
 balance


sheet
 that's
 remained
 stable
 for


decades.
 We're
 just
 not
 doing
 it.
 You


can
 get
 on
 our
 grid
 and
 you
 can
 pay
 the


cost
 to
 get
 on
 our
 grid,
 but
 in
 terms
 of


power
 generation,
 you've
 got
 to
 bring


your
 own
 project.
 We're
 not
 involved
 in


that.
 Other
 utilities
 that
 have
 larger


balance
 sheets,
 the
 Southeastern


utilities
 are
 using
 their
 regulated


balance
 sheets
 to
 build
 out
 generation


and
 supply
 data
 center
 customers,
 devils


in
 the
 details
 on
 those
 heavily
 redacted


commercial
 agreements
 that
 I
 would
 I


would
 desperately
 love
 to
 see
 about
 the


degree
 to
 which
 they
 protect
 consumers.


And
 then
 of
 course
 the
 other
 side
 of
 the


industry,
 the
 competitive
 industry.
 You


know,
 it's
 companies
 like
 mine
 and
 data


centers
 that
 enter
 into
 commercial


agreements
 for
 the
 B
 purchase
 and
 sale


of
 power.
 And
 neither
 of
 those
 parties


have
 recourse
 to
 a
 captive
 base
 of


customers.
 So
 they
 could
 go
 bust,
 we


could
 go
 bust.
 It's
 not
 going
 to,
 you


know,
 be
 skin
 off
 the
 teeth
 of
 a
 set
 of


quote
 unquote
 rateayers.
 Again,
 on
 the


grid
 costs,
 it's
 about
 whether
 or
 not


state
 commisss,
 and
 in
 this
 case,
 a


federal
 regulator,
 the
 Federal
 Energy


Regulatory
 Commission,
 are
 going
 to


style
 take
 or
 pay
 contractual
 agreements


to
 require
 large
 data
 centers
 that
 come


onto
 the
 grid
 to
 essentially


collateralize


a
 revenue
 stream
 associated
 with
 the


incremental
 costs
 of
 developing
 the
 grid


to
 serve
 them.
 And
 so
 far
 there
 seems
 to


be
 relative
 unonymity
 that
 that
 is
 the


right
 way
 to
 go
 in
 order
 to
 protect


legacy
 customers.
 But
 again,
 the
 devil's


in
 the
 details
 and
 I
 I
 have
 a
 problem


with
 some
 of
 the
 math
 that's
 being
 done


in
 those
 regulatory
 approaches.
 So
 it's


not
 as
 if
 this
 problem
 is
 invisible
 to


the
 people
 who
 are
 economically


regulating
 this
 industry,
 but
 they
 are


trying
 to
 in
 a
 very
 real
 way
 they
 are


trying
 to
 figure
 it
 out
 in
 real
 time.


and
 they
 and
 I'll
 be
 the
 first
 to
 say


their
 solution
 set
 is
 far
 from
 perfect.


So
 just
 on
 this
 note,
 it
 strikes
 me
 that


the
 difficulty
 in
 the
 system,
 I
 mean,


setting
 aside
 the
 patchwork
 of
 50


different
 states
 all
 having
 their
 own


different
 regulations.
 Like
 the
 heart
 of


the
 difficulty
 in
 the
 current
 system
 is


we're
 trying
 to
 preserve
 the
 market


signal
 for
 further
 investment
 but
 also


smooth
 out
 some
 of
 the
 volatility
 so


that
 Joe
 and
 I
 don't
 have
 to
 spend
 an


inordinate
 amount
 of
 time
 thinking
 about


what
 is
 like
 the
 most
 cost-effective


time
 to
 blow
 dry
 our
 hair
 or
 do
 our


laundry
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 So
 we're


kind
 of
 trying
 to
 have
 our
 capitalism


cake
 and
 eat
 it
 too.
 cakealism.
 Kodalism


that
 kind
 of
 works.
 What
 is
 your


platonic
 ideal
 of
 a
 electricity
 market?


Do
 you
 have
 one
 either
 in
 the
 US
 or


elsewhere
 in
 the
 world
 that
 you
 would


say
 look
 here
 is
 a
 system
 that
 actually


manages
 to
 do
 both
 these
 things?


>> Yeah,
 man.
 I
 love
 that
 question.
 I
 mean,


I
 I
 will
 say
 the
 one
 of
 the
 real
 flaws


in
 the
 US
 electricity
 system
 is
 that
 it


is
 not
 as
 robustly
 a
 two-sided
 market
 as


you
 would
 hope
 for.
 It's
 still
 demand


just
 exists
 on
 the
 system.
 It's
 coming


onto
 the
 system
 based
 on
 people's
 on
 the


supply
 side
 guesses
 about
 what
 will


happen
 and
 then
 the
 supply
 side
 is


expected
 to
 solve
 all
 of
 it.
 there's


very
 little
 in
 the
 way
 of
 demand


elasticity
 and
 that's
 been
 for
 a
 variety


of
 historical
 reasons.
 I
 mean
 the
 first


and
 most
 obvious
 one
 is
 that
 you
 didn't


even
 have
 the
 technology
 in
 the
 form
 of


advanced
 metering
 infrastructure
 to


understand
 when
 people
 were
 actually


using
 the
 power
 in
 relation
 to
 a
 highly


time
 variable
 set
 of
 upstream
 costs.
 Now


you
 do
 have
 that
 you
 are
 also


increasingly
 having
 the
 software
 that


allows
 financial
 settlements
 on
 the
 part


of
 the
 people
 retailing
 electricity
 to


enduse
 consumers
 to
 be
 settled
 on
 the


basis
 of
 that
 advanced
 metering


infrastructures
 actual
 meter
 reads.
 So


on
 a
 time
 interval
 basis
 and
 finally


because
 you
 shouldn't
 have
 to
 think


about
 when
 you're
 going
 to
 blow
 dry
 your


hair,
 you
 have
 a
 significant
 amount
 of


device
 automation
 in
 the
 form
 of
 smart


thermostats,
 battery
 storage,
 electric


vehicles,
 manufacturing
 and
 industrial


processes
 which
 can
 be
 sort
 of
 a
 set
 it


and
 forget
 it
 to
 automatically
 respond


to
 high
 prices
 to
 try
 to
 increase
 the


systems
 load
 factor
 and
 avoid
 using


electricity
 at
 very
 high
 cost
 times.
 So


that
 is
 just
 starting
 to
 happen
 in
 the


American
 electricity
 sector.
 I
 would


tend
 to
 look
 to
 the
 UK
 and
 Australia
 as


places
 that
 have
 gone
 a
 bit
 ways
 further


in
 trying
 to
 solve
 that
 problem
 and


embrace
 the
 inherent
 flexibility
 of
 the


system
 as
 versus
 the
 United
 States
 which


is
 kind
 of
 stuck
 in
 this
 sort
 of
 supply


does
 something
 to
 demand
 framework
 of


industry.
 So
 that
 that's
 definitely
 on


my
 like
 it's
 always
 on
 the
 top
 of
 my


homework
 list
 if
 only
 because
 I
 think
 a


lot
 of
 people
 are
 thinking
 about
 solving


this
 problem
 highly
 conventionally
 with


supply
 editions
 which
 is
 going
 to
 be


really
 important
 but
 that
 demand


flexibility
 component
 is
 actually


essential
 to
 get
 to
 a
 market
 that
 looks


like
 every
 other
 efficient
 and


competitive
 market
 in
 the
 world
 which


has
 two
 sides
 to
 it.
 We've
 been
 talking


a
 lot
 about
 sort
 of
 the
 future
 looking


forward
 and
 figuring
 out,
 you
 know,
 how


that
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 all
 this
 uh
 this


new
 capacity
 onto
 the
 market,
 etc.
 Let's


look
 at
 the
 last
 several
 years.
 Like


what
 happened?
 Part
 of
 the
 reason
 we're


even
 having
 this
 conversation
 is
 because


electricity
 bills
 are
 on
 people's
 minds,


right?
 And
 they've
 been
 high
 and
 it's
 a


little
 unclear
 like
 how
 much
 of
 this
 is


just
 keeping
 up
 with
 inflation.
 I


presume
 that
 like
 grid
 maintenance
 is


actually
 straightforwardly
 an
 effect
 of


labor
 cost
 inflation
 etc.
 One
 thing
 we


do
 know
 however
 is
 that
 the
 pace
 of


electricity
 price
 increases
 really
 since


the
 pandemic
 seems
 to
 have
 been
 a
 level


step
 up.
 What's
 driven
 that?
 How
 would


you
 characterize
 the
 last
 several
 years


of
 electricity
 prices
 and
 perhaps
 the


role
 of
 load
 growth
 in
 driving
 those


increases?
 Yeah.
 So,
 so
 far
 load
 growth


is
 really
 not
 the
 contributor
 to
 what


has
 happened
 here.
 It
 is
 almost
 an


awakening
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 had


already
 without
 any
 more
 load
 growth
 a


less
 reliable
 system
 than
 we
 thought
 we


did.
 And
 that's
 due
 to
 a
 variety
 of


reasons.
 you
 know,
 we
 retired
 a
 lot
 of


coal,
 which,
 you
 know,
 had
 a
 lot
 of


emissions,
 but
 we
 replaced
 it
 with
 a


bunch
 of
 natural
 gas.
 That
 created
 a,


you
 know,
 a
 a
 sort
 of
 more
 of
 a


dependency
 on
 an
 interrelated
 network


system,
 the
 gas
 supply
 and
 pipeline


system,
 which
 while
 usually
 very
 robust


and
 very
 economically
 efficient,
 in


winter
 conditions
 where
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


residential
 heating
 drawn,
 that
 system


can
 show
 frailties.
 And
 so
 market


operators
 in
 these
 electricity
 markets


sort
 of
 derated
 the
 value
 of
 that


capacity
 in
 how
 they
 set
 up
 these


markets
 which
 meant
 effectively
 a
 sort


of
 administrative
 withdrawal
 of
 supply


from
 some
 of
 these
 markets.
 Similar
 to


that,
 renewables
 were
 seen
 not
 as
 a


onetoone
 replacement
 for
 reliable


generation
 in
 the
 parts
 of
 the
 country,


the
 middle
 of
 the
 country
 especially


where
 they
 were
 heavily
 invested
 in,
 but


they
 were
 really
 being
 leaned
 on
 as
 an


effective
 substitute
 for
 more


dispatchable
 power.
 And
 I
 think
 everyone


in
 the
 back
 of
 their
 head
 knew
 that


wasn't
 the
 case,
 but
 only
 recently
 have


as
 things
 have
 gotten
 tight
 have
 people


begun
 to
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 hard
 math
 around


it.
 And
 then
 finally,
 you
 know,
 we've


just
 seen
 a
 few
 really
 traumatic
 winter


storms
 in
 particular,
 one
 in
 the
 east


and
 one
 in
 Texas
 that
 have
 sort
 of


reshaped
 the
 way
 in
 which
 the
 people
 who


have
 responsibility
 to
 operate
 the
 grid


think
 about
 the
 operational
 posture
 and


need
 for
 reliable
 resources
 on
 the
 grid.


And
 so
 there
 were
 a
 variety
 of


regulatory
 changes
 that
 were
 made
 that


had
 net
 of
 net
 the
 effect
 to
 tighten
 up


the
 understanding
 of
 what
 generating


capacity
 was
 available
 in
 the
 system


relative
 to
 a
 base
 of
 demand
 that
 really


didn't
 change.
 But
 suddenly
 because
 of


all
 of
 the
 retirements
 that
 had
 happened


of
 coal
 and
 older
 gas
 due
 to
 economics


as
 well
 as
 environmental
 regulation
 we


suddenly
 found
 ourselves
 pretty
 tight.


And
 then
 this
 demand
 growth
 started
 to


happen.
 So
 we
 were
 not
 particularly
 well


positioned
 for
 the
 present
 moment
 of


demand
 growth.
 We
 had
 already
 driven
 the


system
 to,
 you
 know,
 some
 might
 call
 it


a
 tight
 and
 efficient
 system
 if
 you
 had


demand
 growth
 that
 was
 level,
 but
 it
 was


not
 well
 situated
 to
 pick
 up
 tens
 and


tens
 of
 new
 gigawatts
 of
 demand.
 I
 have


a
 hypothetical
 question,
 but
 just
 as
 a


theoretical
 exercise,
 if
 we
 are
 all
 in


the
 pursuit
 of
 cheap
 and
 plentiful


energy,
 and
 if
 as
 part
 of
 that
 pursuit,


you
 could
 choose
 between
 two
 options,


you
 could
 either
 wave
 a
 magic
 wand
 and


get
 a
 bunch
 of
 nuclear
 reactors


scattered
 around
 America,
 or
 you
 could


wave
 a
 magic
 wand
 and
 get
 huge
 advances


in
 battery
 technology
 across
 America.


Which
 of
 those
 would
 be
 most
 conducive


to
 having
 that
 cheap
 and
 plentiful


energy
 supply?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 I'm
 going
 to
 make
 a
 lot


of
 my
 friends
 unhappy
 with
 this
 one,
 but


I'd
 probably
 go
 batteries
 and
 storage.
 I


think
 there
 are
 some
 natural
 economic


advantages
 in
 wide
 swaths
 of
 the
 country


for
 relatively
 affordable
 even
 without


subsidies.
 Solar
 production
 in


particular
 and
 batteries
 seem
 like
 a


pretty
 good
 natural
 match
 to
 that.
 It


really
 has
 been
 in
 the
 kind
 of
 Texas


story
 to
 date,
 the
 pairing
 of
 batteries


and
 solar
 together
 with
 natural
 gas


additions
 that
 have
 supported
 really
 the


only
 electricity
 market
 that
 has
 been


growing
 without
 data
 centers.
 So,
 I


would
 take
 that
 as
 the
 leading


indicator.
 That's
 not
 to
 speak
 ill
 of
 my


friends
 in
 the
 nuclear
 bro
 community.
 I


I
 hope
 that
 technology
 advances
 that


seem
 to
 be
 occurring
 in
 the
 small


modular
 space
 come
 to
 fruition.
 I
 just


so
 far
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 people


laying
 down
 serious
 capital
 on
 that
 from


a
 commercial
 perspective,
 but
 I
 do
 see


people
 laying
 down
 money
 on
 storage.


>> I
 just
 have
 one
 last
 question
 and
 it's


kind
 of
 cheating.
 I'm
 actually
 my
 this


question
 I'm
 kind
 of
 have
 going
 to
 have


you
 do
 our
 work
 for
 us,
 etc.,
 you
 know,


I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 of
 a
 really
 good


title
 for
 this
 episode,
 but
 if
 you
 look


out
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years,
 you
 know,


you
 mentioned
 adding
 a
 whole
 California


to
 Texas.
 How
 are
 you
 thinking
 about
 the


scale
 of
 the
 challenge
 overall
 that
 the


US
 electricity
 system
 that
 the
 grid


overall
 really
 faces
 in
 this
 moment?


Like
 how
 big
 is
 it
 that
 everyone
 from


companies
 like
 yours
 to
 the
 various


utility
 commissions
 like
 how
 big
 is
 this


uh
 challenge
 going
 to
 be?


>> It
 could
 be
 a
 substantial
 one.
 I
 mean
 I


think
 that
 AI
 demand
 growth
 for


electricity
 consumption
 is
 real.
 I
 also


think
 that
 that
 growth
 needs
 to
 pony
 up


financial
 commitments
 to
 engender


capital
 investments
 in
 the
 power
 sector


that
 it
 intends
 to
 rely
 upon.
 I
 think


those
 will
 be
 the
 table
 stakes
 of
 their


social
 license
 to
 operate
 in
 a
 grid
 that


even
 where
 competition
 has
 been


introduced
 remains
 pretty
 heavily


regulated.
 So
 I
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to


get
 there.
 I
 I
 do
 think
 that
 in
 terms
 of


the
 regulatory
 policy
 that
 I
 deal
 with,


there's
 too
 much
 small
 ball
 thinking
 on


this
 and
 there's
 too
 much
 trust
 in
 the


way
 we've
 always
 done
 things.
 It's


probably
 a
 time
 to
 really
 have
 kind
 of


regulatory
 policy
 innovations
 like
 we've


seen
 with
 the
 FCC
 regulating
 spectrum


and
 the
 deregulation
 of
 the
 airline


industry
 that
 tries
 to
 allocate
 the


capacity
 on
 the
 grid
 to
 the
 highest


value,
 the
 people
 who
 are
 actually


willing
 to
 pay
 the
 most
 for
 it.
 and


those
 payments
 which
 would
 likely
 exceed


the
 incremental
 costs
 of
 serving
 them


could
 then
 actually
 be
 a
 revenue
 source


back
 to
 consumers
 that
 helps
 on
 the


affordability
 side.
 So
 I,
 you
 know,
 it's


almost
 a
 call
 to
 your
 listeners
 that,


you
 know,
 if
 you're
 doing
 a
 uh
 a
 mundane


corporate
 job
 and
 want
 to
 do
 something


completely
 different,
 consider
 becoming


a
 utility
 regulator
 and
 applying
 some


market-based
 principles
 to
 to
 help
 solve


some
 of
 these
 problems
 because
 really


when
 you
 think
 about
 it,
 utility


regulation,
 they
 need
 to
 be
 an
 agent
 of


capital
 formation
 here
 in
 the
 sector
 and


to
 clarify
 this
 [music]
 moment
 in
 terms


of
 demand
 uncertainty.
 And
 that
 is
 the


kind
 of
 challenge
 on
 a
 conceptual
 basis


that
 we're
 grappling
 with.


>> Travis
 Cavula,
 you
 know,
 we
 could
 talk


to
 you
 for
 hours
 actually
 just
 on,
 you


know,
 I
 have
 a
 million
 more
 questions


just
 about
 specifics
 from
 your
 time
 in


Montana
 and
 how
 all
 those
 things
 work.


But
 uh
 we'll
 let
 you
 go.
 Really


appreciate
 your
 time.
 Let's
 do
 it
 again


sometime.
 And
 uh
 I
 did
 learn
 a
 few


things
 on
 this
 episode.
 So
 appreciate


you
 coming
 on
 OddLog.


>> Thank
 you
 [music]
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Thomas.
 That
 was


great.


>> [music]


>> Tracy,
 I
 really
 like
 that.
 I
 really
 like


the
 way
 you
 put
 it
 there
 in
 your


question
 of
 we
 want
 to
 have
 a
 marketish


environment
 and
 demand
 signals
 are


pretty
 important,
 etc.
 And
 we
 want


capital
 to
 flow
 where
 it's
 going
 to
 be


profitable
 and
 all
 that.
 We
 just
 don't


really
 want
 any
 of
 the
 pain
 [laughter]


associated
 with
 the
 market.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 mean
 the
 irony
 is
 that


the
 market
 could
 be
 functioning
 as


intended
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 a
 large


consumer
 of
 power
 like
 a
 data
 center


decides
 to
 relocate
 itself
 to
 a
 place


where
 energy
 costs
 are
 actually
 quite


low


>> and
 then
 because
 it
 does
 that
 ends
 up


distributing
 you
 know
 the
 cost
 of
 its


own
 power
 needs
 across
 a
 wider
 area.
 And


it
 all
 seems
 I
 mean
 I'm
 just
 going
 to
 go


back
 to
 what
 I
 said
 earlier.
 It
 all


seems
 so
 convoluted


>> and
 so
 idiosyncratic
 across
 different


jurisdictions.
 I
 do
 actually
 really


respect
 Travis's
 call
 just
 then.
 If


you're
 interested
 in
 markets
 and
 want
 to


have
 an
 impact
 on
 people's
 everyday


lives,
 consider
 trying
 to
 clean
 up
 the


mess
 that
 is
 energy
 regulation.
 But
 you


know
 even
 in
 the
 nonconvoluted


version
 of
 it
 if
 we
 just
 imagine
 the


platonic
 ideal
 of
 a
 normal
 market
 and


there's
 this
 commodity
 electrons
 and


it's
 well
 what
 if
 AI
 is
 this
 really


valuable
 thing
 and
 it's
 more
 valuable


than
 blow
 drying
 your
 hair.
 I
 mean
 for


real
 this
 could
 be
 a
 thing
 like
 you
 know


we
 were
 talking
 about
 making
 cars
 or


making
 steel
 etc.
 would
 be
 like
 oh
 yeah


well
 this
 is
 this
 value
 productive


thing.


>> I
 wasn't
 going
 to
 do
 it.
 I
 wasn't
 going


to,
 but
 now
 I'm
 gonna
 bring
 up
 that
 time


you
 wrote
 that
 mining
 crypto
 could


theoretically
 be
 a
 more
 valuable


activity
 than
 running
 a
 fridge.


>> Well,
 right,
 this
 is
 the
 question.
 In
 a


normal
 market,
 the
 reason
 why
 that


example
 seems
 absurd,
 I'm
 glad
 you


actually
 brought
 up
 because
 the
 reason


why
 that
 example
 seems
 absurd
 is
 because


very
 few
 people
 could
 ever
 wrap
 their


heads
 around,
 well,
 could
 crypto
 mining


be
 more
 valuable
 or
 value
 ad
 than


running
 a
 fridge.
 That
 being
 said,
 when


it
 comes
 to
 something
 like
 AI,
 there


really
 is
 a
 debate.
 And
 some
 people


would
 say
 that's
 a
 total
 waste
 because


AI
 is
 just
 a
 costly
 way
 to
 make
 fast


poems.
 And
 other
 people
 would
 say,
 no,


this
 is
 the
 fourth
 industrial
 revolution


or
 whatever.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 part
 of
 the


reason
 we're
 sort
 of
 uncomfortable
 with


the
 oh
 let's
 just
 move
 the
 electrons
 to


where
 they're
 who's
 going
 to
 pay
 for


them
 most
 is
 because
 I
 don't
 think
 a
 lot


of
 people
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 who


intuitively
 are
 skeptical
 that
 this
 is
 a


good
 allocation
 of
 real
 resources


>> right
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 politically
 the


message
 that
 the
 cost
 of
 your


electricity
 has
 to
 go
 up
 so
 that
 AI
 can


do
 its
 thing
 and
 you
 can
 lose
 your
 job


is
 an
 extremely
 unpalatable
 one.
 No,


it's
 totally
 it's
 totally
 I
 think
 this


is
 why
 it's
 going
 to
 like
 break
 a
 lot
 of


people's
 brands.
 But
 on
 the
 other
 hand,


if
 we
 accept
 that,
 you
 know,
 the
 belief


that
 markets
 are
 generally
 good


allocators
 of
 resources,
 etc.,
 they're


like,
 well,
 it's
 not
 really
 our
 job
 to


have
 an
 opinion
 on
 this
 is
 a
 good
 use,


this
 is
 not
 a
 good
 use.
 But
 anyway,
 I
 I


did
 find
 that
 to
 be
 a
 very
 um


interesting
 conversation.
 It
 does
 seem


like
 those
 commissions
 that
 have
 to


decide
 what
 is
 an
 appropriate
 amount
 to


spend
 on
 upgrades
 and
 capacity,
 they


really
 have
 their
 uh
 work
 cut
 out
 for


them
 right
 now.


>> Yeah.
 The
 way
 I
 would
 put
 it
 is
 they
 are


not
 always
 the
 most
 popular
 people
 among


their
 respective
 jurisdictions.
 That's


for
 sure.


>> Well,
 someone
 has
 to
 have
 the
 job
 of


doing
 the
 unpopular
 stuff,
 right?


Someone
 has
 to
 have
 the
 job
 of


adequately
 compensating
 investors
 in


utilities
 for
 the
 risks
 that
 they
 take


on
 in
 providing
 a
 necessary
 commodity


for
 life
 and
 the
 fourth
 industrial


revolution.


>> That's
 right.


>> All right.

 we
 leave
 it
 there?
