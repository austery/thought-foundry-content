Lynette Ong is a distinguished
professor of Chinese politics at
the University of Toronto, and
the director of the China
Governance Lab at U of T's Munk
School of Global Affairs.
And Lynette joins us in studio.
How are you doing?
>> Good.
How are you?
>> I am doing well.
Now let's talk.
Given the state of US-Canada
relations, some say that Canada
is now freed from the pressure
of bloc shaped politics and can
engage with China in a more
pragmatic way.
What are your thoughts on that?
>> I would agree with that.
If by blockchain politics you
mean United States and its
Western allies, I think United
States have actually broken
trust among a lot of allies,
including Canada and European
countries.
So people.
So countries are out there
trying to pursue their own
interests, often on an issue by
issue basis.
And in our case, China has been
the second largest trading
partner.
I think it makes sense for for
Canada to look to look to China,
kind of to diversify away of our
trade from the United States
towards China.
But I think we shouldn't stop at
China.
China would be the beginning of
our of our diversification
strategy.
We should also look to
Indo-Pacific and Europe.
>> All right.
We'll talk about some of those
potential countries making
deals.
But some see Canada's trade deal
with Beijing as risk management
under pressure and not a pivot
away from the US.
What are your thoughts on that?
>> Like the Prime Minister has
put it, I think it's a way of
buying insurance.
Yes, it's a risk management.
It's not putting all our eggs in
one basket.
So diversifying our eggs in many
different baskets.
But that also means that we are
pivoting away from the United
States.
We are diversifying our reliance
away from the United States
towards a bunch of other
countries.
And one of them, and the largest
among them would be China.
So it's a bit of both.
>> Among Canadians, engagement
with China remains politically
sensitive, following years of
hostility between the two
governments, especially under
Trudeau.
How should Carney navigate that?
>> I think he has to walk a very
fine, fine line.
I think so far he has done
pretty well, I would think.
On the domestic front, we have
seen a shift towards Canadians
attitudes towards the United
States.
Under Trump, Unfavorability
rating of the United States has
actually gone up vis a vis
Beijing.
Beijing China used to be very
unpopular in Canada for very
obvious reasons.
We have got two Canadians being
detained for 1000 days, right.
And I think on the domestic
front, the domestic landscape
has changed a little bit, has
changed quite a bit under under
Trump, Washington, D.C.
is now more unpopular than
Beijing, and that's reflected in
the kind of latest public
opinion poll, not only in Canada
but across a lot of Western
nations conducted by Pew
Research.
So on that front, he has got a
little bit more mandate, but I
think the government needs to go
out there and not only sell to
people that we need to pay more
attention to China, but also be
also be firm on China, not
forgetting, you know, our
commitment towards democracy in
Taiwan and be able to come to
trade between China and our
commitments towards, you know,
all the values that are still
important to us, including
democracy in Taiwan, human
rights issues and so forth.
>> What does firm look like?
>> You know, for instance, I
think our business with Taiwan
should go according as usual,
you know, should should be as
usual.
We shouldn't prematurely pull
MPs out of Taiwan trip.
Okay.
Right.
We should not cancel any Taiwan
trade deal that we have planned.
We have planned for.
I think that would be
prematurely kowtowing.
I think that would be
prematurely being you know, I
think with that, we are we are
signalling to Beijing that we
need them more than they need
us.
I think that's not necessarily
true.
You know, I think China is at a
phase where economically it's
weak.
Real estate use accounts for 30%
of GDP growth.
Its economy, its economic growth
has has not recovered to the
pre-pandemic level.
It probably never will.
And it now needs to to depend on
export led growth to drive its
economy.
And Canada is one of those
places that it looks to.
But more importantly, I think
because Canada shares a border
with the United States, used to
be closest ally of the United
States, and where the
instruction to arrest Meng
Wanzhou came from.
Not to forget that.
So in the in the age of kind of
great power competition between
the United States and China, we
would think that China naturally
wants a better relationship with
Canada.
So in that sense, you know, I
think we should go in there, you
know, with all the confidence
and we, we we do have cards in
our hands,
>> Okay.
>> Is what I'm saying.
>> I want to get a better
understanding of the meetings
that happened with Mark Carney
just last month, but also the
UK's prime minister, Keir
Starmer.
He had went but very different
in terms of what had come out of
it.
Can you can you give us a little
insight into how those two
meetings would have gone?
>> Yeah.
You know, Keir Starmer, the
British prime minister of the
Beijing trip, he was hammered at
home.
Right.
But you know Mark Carney after
that he went to Davos and then
came back celebrated as a hero.
They're two very different
reception I think, you know,
people would say that Britain
gave away a little bit too much
before the trip.
He approved the mega embassy in
in London with a lot of, you
know, concern about potentially
espionage and spies and, you
know, underground tunnels and so
on.
So he gave away a little bit too
much before he went to Beijing.
So he was seen as kind of weak,
giving concessions vis a vis
China.
Whereas us I think we have hold
on to it a little bit more, more
firmly.
And we didn't actually give away
a lot of concessions.
The EV tariff reduction is
actually restricted to a very
small number of quarters.
>> You bring up EV.
So I need to talk about some
critical minerals.
The Trump administration
recently announced a new US
trade bloc.
And that would help because
China owns a pretty substantial
share of the market.
But Canada has not signed yet.
Should Canada?
>> I'm not sure whether US has
the credibility to mobilise any
country to form a trade bloc,
with its recent behaviour tone
towards taking over Greenland,
alienating a bunch of European
allies.
You see what happened in Munich
security conference.
People are not reassured.
Trust has definitely broken
Rubio.
Right after Munich went to
Hungary and spoke to Viktor
Orban.
People don't know where the
United States stands.
So what if we enter into a trade
bloc on critical minerals with
the United States?
They could turn around and do
something against us.
I think without that sort of
predictability and credibility,
it will be difficult to lead.
And any sort of alliance.
>> With that.
Canada is spearheading its own
efforts to create a trading bloc
between the European Union and a
12 nation Indo-Pacific bloc.
This is we're talking, 1.5
billion people amongst all those
nations.
The US is not part of this.
And I'm curious, can it succeed
without the US with everything
that you've mentioned?
>> Yeah.
The proposal was between CBC and
and and and a bunch of European
Union countries.
Right.
>> And of course, Lynette, when
you say CPTPP, we are talking
about the Comprehensive and
Progressive Agreement for
Trans-Pacific partnership.
>> I think the very idea is kind
of complementarity between these
countries, which is more
developing countries in the
Indo-Pacific versus more, more
industrialised nations in
Europe.
So if those two regions
combined, I think would
constitute a large proportion of
the world's GDP, that would be a
good counterbalance against the
United States.
I don't see that as kind of
necessarily as whether we need
the United States to succeed.
But I think if there is enough
complementarity and differences
in comparative advantage among
these countries, there's a lot
of benefits to be gained.
Yeah.
>> Does this present a chance?
You mentioned the speech at
Davos.
Here's an opportunity for the
middle powers.
Is this a chance for them to be
for Canada to be more assertive
on that world stage?
>> I think so I think so I think
Canada is in the right place to
lead because we are we used to
be the closest ally to the
United States and now we are
not.
So we have there's a lot of
serious damage being done to
Canadian diplomacy.
And I think our prime prime
minister, in addition to being a
political leader, he's also an
intellectual, someone who could
conceptualise ideas, who could
articulate kind of big ideas and
deliver it to common people.
With a combination of the two, I
think we are in a good position
to lead and mobilise countries
and to stand to stand firm and
get middle powers, hang together
to advance our interests.
>> Well, now we are going to
leave it there, of course,
something that we will continue
to follow.
Thank you so much for your
insights.
>> Thank you for having me.
