>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 podcast.
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.


>> Tracy,
 we're
 recording
 this
 August
 26th,


2025.
 There's
 a
 lot
 going
 on
 right
 now,


particularly
 in
 I
 guess
 many
 big


questions
 about
 macro
 and
 governance
 and


all
 kinds
 of
 things
 in
 some
 of
 the


richest
 countries
 in
 the
 world.


>> That
 is
 certainly
 one
 way
 to
 put
 it.
 So


just
 overnight
 we
 had
 headlines
 saying


that
 Trump
 was
 going
 to
 fire
 Lisa
 Cook


from
 the
 Fed.


>> And
 this
 obviously
 fits
 into
 the
 whole


debate
 around
 central
 bank
 independence


and
 how
 much
 influence
 governments


should
 actually
 have
 on
 central
 banks.


And
 it
 turns
 out
 this
 is
 a
 debate
 that


we've
 had
 before
 in
 other
 countries.


>> Totally.
 And
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 I
 think


Trump
 is
 focused
 on
 the
 Fed
 is
 the
 high


level
 of
 interest
 payments
 and
 he'd
 like


to
 see
 them
 come
 down.
 Speaking
 of


interest
 payments,
 this
 morning
 I
 saw


the
 headline
 that
 the
 UK
 30-year
 guilt


is
 like
 at
 the
 highest
 since
 1989.
 It


continues
 to
 elevate.
 So
 for
 all
 the


stress
 that
 we
 have
 here,
 all
 the
 fiscal


pressure,
 inflationary
 pressure,
 it


actually
 seems
 potentially
 worse


elsewhere.
 Although
 yes,


>> I
 will
 say
 the
 pound
 is
 up
 against
 the


dollar,
 right?
 So
 from
 a
 currency


perspective,
 we're
 kind
 of
 doing
 worse


>> from
 a
 currency
 uh
 perspective,
 but


there's
 a
 lot
 these
 things
 are
 global
 is


I
 think
 the
 point
 and
 all
 of
 these


anxieties
 and
 stresses,
 it's
 not
 just
 a


US
 story.


>> No.
 And
 obviously
 it's
 feeding
 into
 bond


markets
 and
 I
 cannot
 tell
 you
 how
 many


notes
 we
 get
 on
 a
 daily
 basis
 about
 how


governments
 can
 reduce
 the
 debt,
 how


they
 deal
 with
 deficits
 and
 things
 like


that.
 Right
 now,
 everyone's
 talking


about
 this
 these
 days
 here
 in
 2025.
 It


got
 a
 lot
 of
 interest,
 of
 course,
 in


2022
 after
 there
 was
 a
 famous
 spike
 in


yields
 in
 UK
 guilts
 and
 maybe
 this
 sort


of
 premonition
 of
 what
 a
 lot
 of
 rich


countries
 would
 be
 dealing
 with.
 So,
 I'm


very
 excited
 to
 say
 we
 really
 do
 have


the
 perfect
 guest
 to
 speak
 about
 all
 of


this
 today
 to
 understand
 some
 of
 the


pressures
 facing
 rich
 developed


economies.
 We're
 speaking
 with
 the
 right


honorable
 Liz
 Truss,
 former
 prime


minister
 of
 the
 UK,
 author
 of
 the
 recent


book
 10
 years
 to
 save
 the
 West.
 Liz


Truss,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 on


OddLots.
 Thrilled
 to
 have
 you
 here.


>> Good
 to
 be
 on.


>> I
 have
 a
 question.
 You
 know,
 when
 you


see
 like
 30-year
 guilt
 yields
 higher


substantially
 than
 when
 you
 were
 the


prime
 minister
 and
 when
 everyone


attacked
 you
 over
 the
 mini
 budget,
 do


you
 feel
 some
 sense
 of
 like
 sort
 of


vindication
 or
 happiness
 or
 is
 it
 all


like
 despair
 for
 the
 state
 of
 your


country?
 Well,
 I
 do
 feel
 despair
 for
 the


state
 of
 my
 country
 and
 it's
 in
 fact
 why


I
 tried
 to
 do
 what
 I
 tried
 to
 do
 in
 2022


because
 I
 could
 see
 the
 way
 things
 were


going.
 I
 could
 see
 our
 economy
 was


stagnant,
 that
 the
 tax
 revenue
 being


generated
 wasn't
 enough
 to
 cover
 the


amount
 of
 money
 the
 state
 was
 spending.


And
 we
 needed
 to
 do
 something
 different


in
 order
 to
 get
 out
 of
 a
 negative


spiral.
 And
 what
 I
 see
 now
 is
 we're


further
 down
 that
 negative
 spiral
 and
 we


are
 heading
 for
 a
 very
 very
 serious


crisis.
 I
 said
 last
 year
 I
 thought
 we


were
 headed
 for
 an
 IMF
 bailout
 as


Britain
 experienced
 in
 the
 1970s.
 I


think
 that's
 even
 truer
 now
 than
 it
 was


a
 year
 ago.
 And
 we're
 in
 an
 economic


doom
 loop
 of
 higher
 taxes,
 lower
 growth,


higher
 debt.
 And
 it's
 very
 difficult
 now


to
 see
 the
 political
 way
 out
 of
 that.


>> So
 how
 should
 governments
 actually


announce
 or
 unveil
 largecale
 policy


shifts?
 Because
 there
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 a


some
 institutional
 constraint
 and
 then
 b


the
 market
 reaction.
 We
 saw
 that
 this


year
 in
 the
 US
 after
 Trump's
 liberation


day
 announcement.
 You
 know
 a
 lot
 of


people
 were
 saying
 this
 was
 Trump's


trust
 moment.
 How
 should
 governments


actually
 go
 about
 I
 guess
 balancing
 the


views
 of
 the
 market
 with
 you
 know
 big


scale
 change
 in
 terms
 of
 policy?
 I
 think


the
 issue
 that
 I
 faced
 and
 it
 is
 also


the
 issue
 that
 Donald
 Trump
 faces
 in
 the


United
 States
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 mainstream


economic
 establishment
 do
 not
 agree
 with


the
 policies
 that
 I
 was
 pursuing
 and


they
 don't
 agree
 with
 the
 policies
 that


Donald
 Trump
 is
 pursuing.
 So
 you're


operating
 in
 a
 hostile
 environment.
 In


the
 UK's
 case,
 we
 have
 institutions
 that


have
 become
 very
 divorced
 from


government
 policy.
 In
 1998,
 the
 Bank
 of


England
 was
 made
 independent
 by
 Gordon


Brown.
 Since
 then,
 I
 believe
 it
 has
 been


pretty
 much
 unaccountable.
 So,


politicians
 have
 very
 little
 control


over
 monetary
 policy.
 And
 what
 has


happened
 is
 monetary
 policy
 has
 driven


fiscal
 policy.
 It's
 very
 hard
 to


coordinate
 between
 those
 two
 policies
 as


a
 government
 because
 you
 don't
 have


control
 of
 the
 levers.
 Even
 more
 so,


back
 in
 2010,
 George
 Osborne
 established


the
 Office
 of
 Budget
 Responsibility,


which
 handed
 over
 huge
 powers
 to
 another


unelected
 authority.
 It's
 a
 bit
 like
 the


Congressional
 Budget
 Office,
 but
 it
 has


more
 power
 within
 the
 British
 system.
 So


what
 I
 was
 facing
 back
 in
 2022


was


powerful
 institutions
 that
 didn't
 share


my
 policy
 objectives.
 Now
 I
 believed
 as


the
 democratically
 selected
 leader
 of


the
 country
 that
 I
 should
 be
 able
 to


pursue
 those
 policies.
 It
 was
 what
 I
 was


elected
 on.
 In
 fact,
 it
 was
 what
 the


Conservative
 Party
 elected
 on.
 But
 what


I
 faced
 was
 resistance.
 So
 when
 you're


talking
 about
 timing
 of
 policy


announcements,
 it's
 not
 like
 you're


operating
 on
 a


a
 clear
 sea.
 You're
 operating
 in
 a


stormy
 sea
 where
 there
 are
 people
 out


there
 who
 want
 you
 to
 fail.
 Not
 just


your
 political
 opponents,
 but
 also
 the


institutional
 opponents.
 And
 that
 is


what
 Donald
 Trump
 faced
 with
 his
 tariff


policies
 that
 he
 announced
 on
 Liberation


Day.
 A
 lot
 of
 economists
 said
 they


wouldn't
 work.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 say
 said


it
 would
 make
 the
 budget
 deficits
 in
 the


US
 worse
 and
 those
 policy
 makers
 are


very
 influential
 with
 the
 markets.
 So
 in


the
 case
 of
 the
 bank
 of
 England
 or
 the


case
 of
 the
 people
 sitting
 on
 the


Federal
 Reserve
 or
 civil
 servants
 within


the
 Treasury,
 these
 people
 are
 out
 there


creating
 their
 own
 waves.
 So
 I
 think


that's
 the
 context
 you
 have
 to
 see
 what


I
 was
 trying
 to
 do.
 First
 of
 all,
 I


totally
 take
 your
 point
 about
 the
 sort


of
 limitations
 of
 many
 mainstream


economists,
 the
 bias
 of
 many
 mainstream


economists,
 and
 we
 have
 many
 critics
 of


mainstream
 economics
 regularly
 on
 the


show.
 So,
 that's
 a
 point
 well
 taken.


When
 you
 unveiled
 your
 mini
 budget,


given
 the
 fiscal
 constraints
 or
 the


perceived
 fiscal
 constraints,
 why
 tax


cuts
 specifically
 and
 not
 also
 spending


cuts?
 You
 know,
 there's
 so
 many


different
 aspects
 of
 the
 UK
 spending


situation,
 whether
 it's
 the
 triple
 lock


pension.
 There's
 this
 thing
 that
 goes


viral
 on
 Twitter
 a
 lot
 about
 like
 how


easy
 it
 is
 to
 get
 a
 free
 car,
 etc.
 Like,


why
 not
 first
 take
 aim
 at
 potentially


lowhanging
 fruit
 or
 at least
 in


combination,
 you
 know,
 spending
 cuts.


>> Well,
 that
 is
 exactly
 what
 I
 sought
 to


do.
 The
 package
 we
 were
 putting
 forward


was
 a
 combination.
 It
 was
 actually
 not


tax
 cuts.
 it
 was
 reversing
 a
 tax
 rise.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 very
 important


distinction.
 The
 biggest
 measure
 we


wanted
 to
 take
 was
 keeping
 corporation


tax
 at
 19%,
 not
 raising
 it
 to
 25%.
 And
 I


believed,
 and
 I've
 since
 been
 proven


right,
 that
 if
 you
 raise
 corporation
 tax


to
 that
 level,
 you
 get
 less
 business


activity,
 you
 get
 lower
 growth,
 combined


with
 the
 non-dom
 tax
 that's
 been
 put
 in


place
 or
 the
 removal
 of
 the
 non-dom


benefits.
 We've
 seen
 more
 millionaires


leave
 Britain
 than
 any
 other
 country
 in


the
 world
 per
 capita.
 So
 what
 we
 were


doing
 just
 on
 its
 own
 account,
 raising


taxes
 at
 that
 juncture
 back
 in
 2022
 was


a
 bad
 idea.
 I
 believe
 that
 it
 would
 lead


to
 lower
 economic
 growth
 and
 a
 higher


deficit
 in
 the
 long
 term.
 And
 some


economists
 agreed
 with
 me,
 but
 the


economists
 working
 for
 the
 government,


the
 office
 of
 budget
 responsibility
 of


the
 bank
 of
 England
 did
 not
 agree
 with


me
 and
 they
 were
 keen
 on
 that
 policy
 and


in
 fact
 they
 forced
 me
 to
 reverse
 that


policy.
 So
 that's
 one
 point.
 Second


point
 on
 spending
 is
 we
 did
 try
 to
 rein


in
 spending.
 So
 a
 particular
 thing
 I


sought
 to
 do
 was
 increase
 welfare
 by


wages
 not
 prices
 because
 we
 were
 in
 a


very
 high
 inflation
 year
 in
 2022.
 That


would
 have
 saved
 7
 billion
 pounds
 on
 the


government
 budget
 which
 is
 a
 significant


amount.
 What
 I
 found
 was
 that


Conservative
 MPs
 were
 not
 prepared
 to


vote
 for
 that.
 So
 even
 a
 relatively


minor
 change
 which
 was
 simply
 not


raising
 welfare
 as
 much
 as
 it
 was
 going


to
 be
 raised
 created
 a
 massive
 outcry
 on


on
 the
 conservative
 benches.
 So
 the


answer
 on
 spending
 is
 it
 was
 politically


not
 possible.
 Now
 personally
 I
 would


have
 liked
 to
 be
 even
 tougher
 on


spending.
 I
 think
 we
 could
 have
 done


that
 over
 time
 but
 I
 had
 to
 think
 about


what
 was
 politically
 realistic.
 And
 so


what
 we
 had
 is
 spending
 constraint,
 not


raising
 spending
 as
 much
 as
 was


previously
 planned,
 keeping
 taxes
 low


rather
 than
 raising
 them
 and
 choking
 off


economic
 growth,
 which
 is
 what
 I
 thought


it
 would
 do
 and
 was
 what
 actually


happened.
 And
 then
 also
 supply
 side


measures
 such
 as
 legalizing
 fracking
 in


the
 UK,
 making
 it
 easier
 to
 drill
 in
 the


North
 Sea
 so
 that
 you
 stimulate
 the


economy
 with
 supply
 side
 reforms.
 That


was
 the
 overall
 package
 and
 you
 know


what
 happened
 and
 you
 can
 compare
 my


fiscal
 package
 with
 packages
 that
 Richie


Sunnak
 did
 during
 COVID
 or
 packages
 that


Rachel
 Ree
 did
 since.
 My
 package
 was


smaller
 even
 according
 to
 the
 estimates


of
 the
 office
 of
 budget
 responsibility.


And
 yet
 it
 got
 a
 very
 different


reaction.
 And
 this
 is
 because
 the


economic
 establishment,
 the
 key
 figures


in
 the
 Treasury
 and
 the
 Bank
 of
 England


have
 a
 bias
 towards
 a
 more
 Keynesian


approach.
 So
 I
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 important


to
 note
 that
 this
 this
 fiscal
 package


was
 not
 any
 bigger
 than
 packages
 before


or
 after.
 It
 just
 got
 a
 different


reaction.
 I
 think
 the
 other
 the
 other


important
 point
 to
 note
 about
 what


happened
 in
 September
 and
 October
 2022


is
 the
 night
 before
 the
 mini
 budget,
 the


Bank
 of
 England
 announced
 the
 sale
 of
 40


billion
 pounds
 worth
 of
 guilts.
 So
 I
 had


a
 central
 bank
 who
 were
 making


announcements
 that
 made
 our
 lives
 a
 lot


more
 difficult
 the
 day
 before
 the
 mini


budget.
 And
 since
 the
 guilt
 spike
 in


2022,
 the
 Bank
 of
 England
 have
 actually


produced
 a
 paper
 saying
 that
 2/3
 of
 that


spike
 in
 guilts
 was
 down
 to
 their


failure
 to
 regulate
 the
 pensions
 market.


So
 there
 were
 lots
 of
 other
 things
 going


on
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 but
 it
 was
 very


very
 convenient
 for
 the
 mini
 budget
 to


be
 blamed
 for
 what
 happened.
 And
 as
 you


pointed
 out
 at
 the
 beginning
 of
 the


show,
 the
 guilt
 spike
 wasn't
 as
 high
 as


it
 is
 now.
 So
 what
 I
 think
 is
 going
 on


now
 is
 you
 can
 see
 the
 different


treatment
 of
 a
 tax
 spending,


high-spending


Labor
 government
 from
 a
 conservative


politician
 who's
 trying
 to
 pursue,
 in
 my


view,
 laugher,
 curb
 friendly
 tax


freezes,


supply
 side
 reforms,
 and
 spending


restraint.


If
 there's
 an
 institutional
 and
 market


bias
 towards
 economic
 orthodoxy
 or


Keynesianism
 as
 you
 just
 pointed
 out,


why
 not
 try
 to
 adapt
 your
 budget
 or
 your


economic
 policy
 to
 that
 reality?
 Because


it
 it
 did
 seem
 like,
 you
 know,
 you
 were


sort
 of
 expecting
 the
 markets
 to
 adapt


to
 your
 policy
 rather
 than
 vice
 versa.
 I


guess
 I'm
 asking
 is
 just
 is
 there
 a


better
 way
 to
 try
 to
 communicate
 what


you
 were
 doing
 at
 the
 time?


Well,
 I'm
 a
 believer
 in
 democracy
 and
 I


think
 it's
 democratically
 elected


politicians
 that
 should
 decide
 policy,


not
 unelected
 central
 banks.
 And
 you


know,
 there
 is
 a
 network,
 there's
 the


IMF,
 the
 World
 Bank,
 the
 central
 banks


meeting
 regularly.
 They
 are
 far
 too


powerful
 in
 my
 view
 at
 deciding
 what


country's
 economic
 policy
 should
 be
 and


they
 have
 not
 been
 effective.
 You
 know,


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 Bank
 of
 England's


record
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years
 on
 things


like
 inflation,
 on
 economic
 growth,
 it's


been
 extremely
 poor.
 And
 I


fundamentally,
 you
 know,
 why
 should


democratically
 elected
 politicians


cow
 to
 what
 unelected
 officials
 want


when
 we're
 the
 people
 who
 are
 held
 to


account
 for
 the
 success
 of
 failures
 of


the
 policy?
 And
 what
 is
 happening
 now
 is


Rachel
 Reeves
 is
 very
 orthodox.
 She's
 a


former
 Bank
 of
 England
 employee.
 She's


essentially
 taking
 dictation
 from
 the


Bank
 of
 England
 and
 the
 Treasury
 about


what
 she
 should
 do.
 And
 we
 can
 see
 the


results
 of
 that.
 And
 it
 what
 is


happening
 is
 we
 are
 going
 to
 reach
 an


end
 point
 where
 the
 country
 runs
 out
 of


money
 and
 then
 we
 will
 have
 a
 major


crisis
 and
 we
 will
 have
 to
 think


differently.
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 very
 sad


it's
 got
 to
 that
 point.
 This
 was
 obvious


from
 where
 we
 were
 in
 2022,


but
 as
 I've
 said,
 the
 economic
 orthodoxy


proved
 very
 powerful.
 And
 frankly,
 what


is
 the
 point
 of
 wanting
 to
 become
 prime


minister
 if
 you're
 simply
 going
 to
 go


along
 with
 the
 failing
 orthodoxy
 that


has
 put
 your
 country
 in
 the
 problems
 it


is
 already,
 which
 is
 where
 we
 were.
 You


know,
 you
 mentioned
 that
 the
 Bank
 of


England
 wasn't
 really
 independent
 from


HM
 Treasury
 until
 Gordon
 Brown's


chancellorship
 in
 the
 1990s.
 Do
 you


think
 that
 arrangement
 still
 works
 or


would
 you
 perhaps
 call
 for
 reform
 where


maybe
 the
 Treasury
 regains
 some
 of
 its


influence
 over
 the
 central
 bank?


>> I
 think
 the
 Bank
 of
 England
 needs
 to
 be


accountable
 to
 politicians.
 I
 think
 the


current
 system
 doesn't
 work.
 This
 is
 why


I'm
 very
 sympathetic
 to
 what
 Donald


Trump
 is
 saying
 about
 the
 Fed.
 it.


Monetary
 policy
 is
 incredibly
 important.


It
 determines
 the
 allocation
 of
 assets


within
 society.
 You
 know,
 what
 we've


seen
 in
 Britain
 is
 we've
 seen
 people
 who


have,
 you
 know,
 property,
 who
 have


capital


out
 of
 the
 low
 interest
 rates
 that
 the


Bank
 of
 England
 and
 the
 easy
 money
 the


Bank
 of
 England
 has
 created
 over
 the


past
 15
 years.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 young


people
 struggle
 to
 get
 on
 the
 housing


market.
 We
 are
 seeing
 it
 real
 effects
 in


the
 economy
 of
 the
 Bank
 of
 England's


policies.
 And
 as
 a
 Democrat,
 you


somebody
 that
 believes
 in
 democracy,
 I


just
 think
 it's
 wrong
 that
 people
 should


be
 making
 those
 decisions
 and
 not


accountable
 to
 the
 electorate.
 And
 it's


also
 very
 difficult,
 as
 I
 found
 as
 prime


minister,
 to
 combine
 fiscal
 and
 monetary


policy
 if
 you
 don't
 hold
 one
 of
 the


levers.
 So
 yes,
 I
 think
 it's
 got
 to


change.
 And
 I
 think
 there
 is
 a
 reckoning


coming
 for
 the
 central
 banks,
 not
 just


in
 Britain,
 but
 also
 in
 the
 United


States,
 also
 the
 ECB.
 The
 current
 system


does
 not
 work.
 And
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 that
 the
 Bank
 of
 England,
 I


would
 say,
 sabotaged
 what
 I
 was
 trying


to
 do
 is
 I
 was
 a
 critic
 of
 central
 banks


before
 I
 became
 prime
 minister.
 I'd
 been


very
 clear
 that
 I
 thought
 the
 Bank
 of


England's
 record
 was
 not
 good,
 that
 the


Treasury
 should
 have
 much
 more
 of
 a
 role


in
 setting
 the
 mandate
 for
 the
 Bank
 of


England
 and
 they
 didn't
 like
 their
 power


being
 challenged.


[Music]


First
 of
 all,
 I
 want
 to
 say
 I
 think
 your


point
 about
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 political


impossibility
 of
 or
 the
 political
 at


least
 difficulty
 of
 spending
 cuts
 is


really
 important
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 you


had
 the
 Tory
 majority
 obviously
 and
 even


what
 you
 describe
 as
 sort
 of
 modest
 cuts


to
 the
 rate
 of
 growth
 spending
 couldn't


get
 the
 votes
 like
 I
 think
 there's
 a


very
 telling
 issue
 and
 raises
 a
 stress


about
 the
 ability
 of
 any
 democracies
 to


do
 difficult
 things.
 Setting
 aside
 maybe


what's
 politically
 capable
 in
 the
 next


parliament
 should
 the
 next
 parliament


revisit
 questions
 such
 as
 either
 the


triple
 lock
 pensions
 or
 free
 point
 of


use
 at
 the
 NHS.


>> So
 just
 on
 your
 point
 about
 political


possibility
 I
 think
 the
 only
 thing
 that


is
 politically
 possible
 at
 present
 or


certainly
 was
 in
 2022
 was
 to
 try
 and


restrain
 the
 growth
 of
 spending


>> and
 to
 grow
 the
 economy
 faster
 than


that.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 what


>> that
 is
 what
 the
 Trumpite
 strategy
 is
 in


the
 US.
 You've
 got
 to
 outpace


>> the
 growth
 of
 public
 spending.


>> Sure.


>> With
 economic
 growth.


>> I
 think
 that
 is
 only
 possible
 what


you've
 just
 said
 about
 actually
 spending


cuts.


>> Yeah.


>> Is
 when
 there
 is
 some
 kind
 of
 crisis.


>> Well,
 so
 this
 is
 what
 I'm
 saying.
 So
 you


mentioned
 you
 said
 last
 year
 that
 you


were
 worried
 that
 the
 UK
 could
 need


another
 IMF
 bailout.
 There
 were


headlines
 I
 think
 in
 the
 news
 just
 in


the
 last
 week
 of
 some
 economists
 talking


about
 that
 again.
 Okay,
 like
 if
 this
 is


what
 we're
 talking
 about,
 I
 mean, if


this
 is
 real
 and
 we're
 talking
 about
 the


UK
 essentially
 being
 at
 the
 point
 of


needing
 an
 IMF
 bailout,
 is
 it
 time
 to


look
 at
 these
 sort
 of
 core
 pillars
 of


existing
 spending
 levels?
 Well,
 you
 can


see
 what's
 been
 going
 on
 in
 parliament,


which
 is
 the
 Labor
 Party
 tried
 to
 put


through
 some
 modest
 welfare
 cuts
 and


there
 was
 a
 massive
 rebellion
 by
 Labor


MPs.
 Even
 though
 they
 have
 a
 huge


majority
 in
 parliament,
 they
 could
 not


get
 through
 some
 pretty
 minor
 changes.


Smaller
 by
 the
 way,
 than
 the
 amount
 I


was
 proposing
 in
 2022,


>> I
 think
 it
 was
 only
 worth
 about4
 billion


pounds.
 They
 could
 not
 get
 that
 through


their
 current
 parliamentary
 party
 and


all
 of
 the
 evidence
 you
 know
 what


happened
 in
 Greece,
 what
 happened
 in


Ireland
 where
 spending
 cut
 programs
 have


been
 achieved
 or
 Argentina
 is
 another


good
 example
 have
 come
 after
 a
 crisis.
 I


think
 that's
 deeply
 regrettable
 but
 I


can't
 see
 certainly
 with
 the
 current


parliament
 serious
 spending
 cuts


happening
 until
 until
 Britain
 runs
 out


of
 money.
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 Joe's


question
 just
 in
 a
 slightly
 different


way,
 but
 if
 you
 were
 back
 in
 government


today
 and
 guilt
 yields
 are
 where
 they


are,
 what
 specific
 tradeoffs
 between


spending
 and
 taxes,
 tax
 cuts
 would
 you


be
 willing
 to
 make?
 And
 what
 trade-offs


do
 you
 think
 are
 actually
 politically


realistic?
 Well,
 the
 issue
 now
 is
 that


taxes
 have
 got
 so
 high
 that
 they're


choking
 off
 economic
 growth
 and
 we're


seeing
 millionaires
 leaving
 the
 country.


We're
 seeing
 businesses
 closing
 down.


I
 think
 the
 easiest
 thing
 and
 the
 most


sensible
 thing
 to
 do
 straight
 away
 is


all
 the
 supply
 side
 stuff.
 Abolishing


planning
 regulations,
 taking
 on
 the


environmental
 NOS's,
 getting
 on
 with


fracking,
 using
 North
 Sea
 oil,
 maybe


using
 our
 coal
 reserves.
 I
 think
 those


are
 the
 types
 of
 things
 that
 can
 be
 done


relatively
 quickly
 and
 would
 have
 an


impact.


In
 terms
 of
 spending,


of
 course,
 our
 welfare
 state
 needs
 to
 be


reformed.
 I
 think
 something
 like
 over


60%
 of
 Britain's
 budget
 is
 a
 combination


of
 the
 National
 Health
 Service
 and


welfare.
 And
 those
 are
 the
 two
 areas


that
 need
 to
 be
 fixed.
 But
 I
 don't
 think


there's
 any
 room
 for
 maneuver
 now
 on


taxes.


>> Mhm.
 I
 think
 that
 raising
 taxes
 has


proved
 already
 to
 be
 counterproductive.


Doing
 it
 even
 more
 will
 simply
 make
 the


UK
 even
 more
 unattractive
 for
 investors.


So,
 you've
 got
 to
 focus
 on
 supply
 side,


make
 it
 much
 easier
 to
 build
 things,


make
 it
 much
 easier
 to
 frack,
 make
 it


much
 easier
 to
 hire
 people,
 all
 of
 those


kind
 of
 things.
 And
 you
 have
 to
 have


spending
 cuts
 where
 you
 can.
 But,
 as


I've
 said,
 I've
 tried
 myself
 to
 get


spending
 cuts
 through
 parliament.
 It's


It's
 not
 easy.


>> I'm
 gonna
 ask
 a
 really
 ignorant
 American


question
 that
 sometime
 so
 forgive
 me
 if


this
 comes
 off
 as
 blunt.
 I
 just
 so
 I'm


just
 getting
 it
 out
 there,
 but
 is
 there


a
 cult
 at
 the
 NHS
 in
 the
 UK?


>> There
 has
 been
 I
 think
 the
 cult
 is


wearing
 thin,


>> but
 you
 know
 there
 has
 been
 a
 cult.
 I


think
 people
 are
 recognizing
 though
 that


the
 outcomes
 are
 not
 good.
 you
 know
 if


you
 compare
 British
 health
 outcomes
 with


other
 countries
 I
 don't
 think
 the


American
 system
 is
 anything
 to
 aspire
 to


but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 countries
 like


Germany


>> no
 one
 disagrees
 with
 you
 there


>> if
 you
 look
 at
 countries
 like
 Germany


France
 Japan
 you
 know
 they
 managed
 to


achieve
 better
 outcomes
 with
 similar


levels
 of
 funding
 so
 I
 think
 everybody


in
 Britain
 recognizes
 that
 it's
 not


working
 as
 it's
 currently
 constituted


but
 it
 is
 It's
 such
 a
 big
 and
 deep
 issue


to
 resolve.
 It
 really
 is.


>> Joe,
 remind
 me
 to
 tell
 you
 my
 NHS
 horror


story
 later
 on.


>> Everyone
 has
 one.


>> Everyone
 has
 one.
 On
 the
 plus
 side,
 it's


free.
 Right.


>> Right.
 Right.


>> All
 right.
 You
 know,
 I
 want to
 go
 back


to


>> It
 cost
 you
 It
 costs
 you
 in
 other
 ways.


>> True.
 That's
 what
 I
 would
 say.


>> True.
 I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 something
 you


said
 about
 the
 economic
 orthodoxy
 uh


leaning
 towards
 Keynesianism.
 Why
 do
 you


think
 that
 is?
 Like
 why
 is
 that
 the


dominant
 economic
 policy
 framework
 at


the
 moment
 given
 that
 as
 you
 keep


pointing
 out
 you
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 people


would
 argue
 that
 it
 hasn't
 actually


yielded
 good
 outcomes
 for
 the
 developed


world
 in
 the
 80s
 we
 had
 some
 very


successful
 supply
 side
 policies
 both


thatcher
 and
 Reagan
 increased
 economic


growth
 increased
 the
 strength
 of
 our


respective
 economies
 and
 when
 the
 Soviet


Union
 collapsed
 I
 think
 we
 all
 thought


free
 market
 capitalism
 had
 won.
 Low


taxes,
 restrained
 spending,
 supply
 side


economics.


And
 I
 think
 people
 in
 favor
 of
 those


policies
 took
 their
 foot
 off
 the
 pedal


and
 that
 allowed


more
 left-wing
 economics
 to
 gain


traction.
 And
 since
 then
 I
 think
 we've


seen
 it
 in
 universities
 in
 the
 Treasury


in
 the
 Bank
 of
 England
 but
 the
 Keynesian


economics
 has
 become
 much
 more
 prevalent


and
 whether
 it's
 the
 office
 of
 budget


responsibility
 or
 the
 CBO
 they're


looking
 at
 economics
 through
 a
 Keynesian


lens
 and
 I
 think
 it
 is
 a
 big
 question


about
 how
 on
 earth
 after
 seeing
 the


success
 of
 those
 policies
 and
 now
 seeing


the
 failure
 of
 Keynesian
 policies,


anyone
 could
 possibly
 think
 these


policies
 are
 right.
 But
 they've
 proved


very
 hard
 to
 shift.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 left


of
 politics
 have
 been
 very
 successful
 at


capturing
 institutions.
 I
 think
 they've


captured
 large
 parts
 of
 the
 bureaucracy,


the
 universities,
 large
 parts
 of
 the


media.
 you
 know
 there
 was
 you
 know
 in


Britain


there
 has
 not
 you
 know
 just
 talking


about
 these
 the
 events
 of
 2022


there's
 not
 been
 real
 analysis
 of
 what


happened
 and
 what
 the
 bank
 of
 England


did
 and
 how
 the
 institutions
 behaved
 you


it's
 something
 that
 is
 not
 talked
 about


and
 I
 think
 the
 level
 of
 economic


literacy
 in
 the
 media
 is
 also
 got
 lower


and
 certainly
 British
 politics
 just
 gets


reported
 as
 a
 pantomime
 time
 rather
 than


an
 analysis
 of
 the
 issues.


>> There's
 much
 you
 say
 about
 the
 media
 and


the
 way
 reporting
 is
 done
 that
 I


probably
 am
 quite
 sympathetic
 with


actually.
 Would
 you
 ever
 join
 reform?
 If


the
 conservatives
 can't
 p
 modest


slowdowns
 in
 the
 pace
 of
 welfare


increases
 if
 you
 know
 labor
 obviously


has
 its
 issue
 issues,
 would
 you
 join


reform?


I'm
 not
 really
 thinking
 about
 party


politics
 at
 the
 moment
 because
 my
 whole


experience
 of
 being
 in
 government
 and
 I


was
 a
 government
 minister
 for
 10
 years


before
 I
 became
 prime
 minister
 was
 that


the
 power
 was
 not
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 the


politicians
 the
 h
 power
 was
 in
 the
 hands


of
 the
 bureaucrats.
 So
 even
 if
 Nigel


Farage
 gets
 elected
 in
 2029,
 and


currently
 he's
 the
 bookie's
 favorite
 to


get
 elected,


if
 the
 bureaucracy
 isn't
 changed,
 if


there
 isn't
 fundamental
 change
 to
 the


way
 Britain
 is
 run,
 nothing
 will
 alter.


I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of


>> presumably
 presumably
 a
 break
 up
 of
 the


I
 mean,
 right,
 like
 that's
 the
 idea,


right?
 There's
 no
 prospect
 of
 breaking


up
 the
 bureaucracy
 unless
 there's
 like


genuinely
 something
 new
 that
 happens


politically.
 Like
 that
 would
 be
 their


argument,
 right?
 that
 a
 brand
 new
 party


taking
 power
 is
 the
 only
 way
 that
 there


could
 be
 some
 sort
 of
 deep
 institutional


shakeup.


>> Yes,
 in
 some
 ways
 that's
 true
 or
 could


be
 true.
 There's
 no
 reason
 why
 the


Conservative
 Party
 couldn't
 do
 a
 deep


institutional
 shakeup.
 But
 the


Conservative
 Party
 has
 to
 acknowledge


what
 went
 wrong
 for
 14
 years.
 You
 know,


why
 didn't
 we
 solve
 the
 immigration


problem?
 Why
 didn't
 we
 solve
 the
 growth


problem?
 Why
 didn't
 we
 solve
 things
 like


the
 free
 speech
 problem?
 The
 answer
 is


we
 didn't
 reverse
 the
 institutional


changes
 Tony
 Blair
 made.
 And
 I
 talked


about
 how
 he
 made
 the
 Bank
 of
 England


unaccountable.
 He
 also
 made
 the


judiciary
 unaccountable
 with
 things
 like


the
 Human
 Rights
 Act
 and
 the


Constitutional
 Reform
 Act.
 So
 until
 the


Conservatives
 acknowledge
 that
 that
 is


why
 we
 failed
 to
 deliver
 in
 office,
 that


is
 true
 about
 the
 Conservative
 Party.


But
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 two
 Trump


administrations,
 Trump
 one
 and
 Trump
 2,


you
 know,
 in
 Trump
 one,


there
 was
 less
 recognition
 of
 the


institutional
 change
 that
 was
 required


in
 the
 US
 and
 we're
 now
 seeing
 more
 of


that
 from
 Trump.
 So
 my
 point
 is
 whoever


is
 in
 office
 in
 2029
 needs
 to
 understand


that
 the
 British
 state
 needs
 to
 be


fundamentally
 shaken
 up
 otherwise


nothing
 is
 going
 to
 happen.
 And
 I
 make


that
 argument
 to
 all
 parties.


Interestingly
 there
 are
 even
 people
 in


the
 Labour
 party
 backbench
 MPs
 who
 are


saying
 the
 Bank
 of
 England's


independence
 needs
 to
 be
 removed.


They're
 saying
 get
 rid
 of
 the
 office
 of


budget
 responsibility
 because
 they
 can


see
 the
 types
 of
 policies
 they
 want


pursued
 are
 not
 possible
 with
 the


current
 setup.
 Since
 we're
 talking


political
 parties
 and
 on
 this
 note,
 you


know,
 there
 maybe
 there
 is
 some


consensus
 on
 specific
 economic
 policies


as
 you
 point
 out,
 but
 we've
 had
 this


back
 and
 forth
 between
 conservatives
 and


labor
 for
 many,
 many
 years
 now.
 How
 do


you
 actually
 go
 about
 building
 consensus


around
 economic
 policy
 especially
 at
 a


time
 when
 you
 know
 people
 would
 describe


our
 current
 environment
 as
 relatively


turbulent
 and
 guilt
 yields
 are
 where


they
 are.
 I
 would
 say
 there's
 a
 bad


economic
 consensus
 between
 Labor
 and
 the


Conservatives
 at
 present
 which
 is
 nobody


is
 saying
 apart
 from
 me
 and
 a
 few
 others


nobody
 is
 saying
 that
 the
 institutions


need
 to
 change.
 The
 Conservative
 party


are
 also
 wrapping
 themselves
 in
 we
 need


to
 respect
 the
 independent
 bank
 of


England.
 We
 need
 to
 listen
 to
 the
 Office


of
 Budget
 Responsibility.
 They're
 not


prepared
 to
 take
 on
 the
 economic


establishment.
 neither
 are
 the
 Labor


Party
 and
 it
 we're
 in
 a
 situation
 where


the
 policies
 these
 institutions
 believe


in


are
 failing
 and
 they're
 manifestally


failing.
 Guilt
 rates
 are
 now
 much
 higher


than
 they
 were
 back
 in
 2022.


Unemployment
 is
 up.
 Our
 energy
 prices


are
 the
 highest
 in
 the
 world
 and
 the


industry
 is
 closing
 down.
 These
 policies


are
 manifestly
 failing.
 yet
 nobody
 is


challenging


the
 fundamentals
 of
 the
 economic


institutions.


>> You
 know,
 I'm
 glad
 you
 brought
 up
 free


speech
 because
 I'm
 interested
 in
 that
 as


well.
 And
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 again,
 in


the
 West,
 I
 think
 free
 speech,
 liberal


speech
 norms
 are
 good
 and
 so
 I
 worry


about
 when
 I
 see
 them
 failing
 in
 various


countries
 or
 friends
 and
 neighbors.


Palestine
 Action
 seems
 like
 a
 bunch
 of


like
 crusty
 old
 hippies
 and
 I
 know
 they


defaced
 a
 plane,
 but
 they're
 listed
 as
 a


terrorist
 group
 in
 your
 country.
 People


can
 get
 arrested
 even
 just
 for
 saying


support
 them.
 And
 I
 think
 they're
 like
 a


terrorist
 group
 basically
 like
 on
 the


same
 level
 of
 as
 like
 ISIS,
 which
 I


think
 most
 people
 say,
 yes,
 that
 is
 a


genuine
 terrorist
 group.
 Like
 what
 is


going
 on
 there?


>> Well,
 they
 did
 attack
 a
 military
 base


and
 they
 are
 advocating
 for
 terrorism
 in


the
 UK.


They
 deface
 a
 plane
 but
 and
 then
 also


people
 get
 arrested
 or
 in
 trouble
 for


saying
 that
 they
 support
 them.


>> They
 are
 clearly
 a
 problematic


organization
 and
 there
 are
 lots
 of


organizations
 in
 Britain
 that
 are


allowed
 in
 the
 UK
 that
 aren't
 actually


allowed
 in
 many
 Arab
 countries.
 So
 I


think
 it's
 right
 that
 we
 crack
 down
 on


these
 organizations.


I
 do
 think
 when
 people,
 you
 know,
 I
 am
 a


pro-
 free
 speech
 person.
 I'd
 love
 to


have
 the
 First
 Amendment
 here
 in


Britain.
 I
 support
 both
 people
 I
 agree


with
 and
 people
 I
 don't
 agree
 with


having
 a
 lot
 more
 free
 speech.
 And
 it
 is


a
 travesty
 that
 we've
 just
 seen
 Lucy


Connley
 released
 from
 jail
 who
 put
 out
 a


tweet,
 deleted
 it
 four
 hours
 later
 and


was
 sentenced
 to
 31
 months
 in
 prison.


You
 know,
 that
 that
 is
 absolutely


ludicrous.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 become
 an


international
 laughingstock.
 And
 it
 is


an
 attempt
 and
 K
 star
 was
 very
 clear


about
 this.
 It
 is
 an
 attempt
 by
 the


authorities
 to
 suppress
 what
 people
 are


talking
 about.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 very


dangerous
 thing
 for
 a
 society
 for
 a


society
 to
 go
 down.


>> All
 of
 these
 things
 really
 worry
 worry


me
 in
 the
 Lucy
 Connelly
 example.
 So
 she


she
 tweeted
 and
 I
 understand
 that
 she


deleted
 it,
 but
 she
 tweeted
 about


setting
 a
 hotel
 on
 fire.
 I
 mean
 that
 is


arguably
 a
 call
 to
 violent
 action.
 Like


how
 would
 that
 be
 different?
 Would
 you


feel
 the
 same
 way
 if
 someone
 said
 like,


you
 know,
 we
 should
 set
 a
 synagogue
 on


fire?
 Is
 that
 free
 speech?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 what
 she
 said
 would
 not


have
 been
 deemed
 a
 violation
 in
 the
 US


because
 it
 wasn't
 I
 don't
 believe
 she


was
 talking
 about
 a
 specific,
 you
 know,


go
 out
 and
 do
 this
 now.
 It
 was
 a
 general


statement.
 It
 was
 obviously
 a
 terrible


thing
 to
 say
 and
 she
 has
 said
 sorry
 for


that.
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 question
 about


whether
 or
 not
 in
 the
 US
 that
 would
 have


even
 been
 a
 crime
 at
 all.
 And
 even
 if
 it


is
 a
 crime,
 whether
 it
 merits
 a
 31
 month


prison
 sentence
 when
 we
 have
 people


caught
 with
 child
 pornography
 being
 let


off
 with
 no
 jail
 time
 at
 all.
 I
 mean,


you
 probably
 heard
 the
 expression


two-tier
 Britain,
 but
 what
 is
 happening


is
 people
 are
 being
 let
 out
 very
 early


for
 crimes
 like
 child
 rape
 and
 yet
 put


in
 prison
 for


things
 that
 they
 write
 on
 Twitter.
 And


those
 are
 two
 different
 categories
 in
 my


opinion.


>> You
 mentioned
 the
 first
 amendment
 just


then.
 How
 would
 you
 reform
 I
 guess


speech
 rights
 in
 the
 UK
 if
 you
 were
 in


power
 again?


you
 we
 came
 up
 with
 free
 speech,
 freedom


of
 the
 press
 back
 in
 1695


and
 it
 was
 a
 historic
 British
 liberty.


We
 had
 the
 bill
 of
 rights
 of
 course
 1689


which
 then
 the
 United
 States
 you
 know


built
 on
 that
 with
 your
 bill
 of
 rights


and
 so
 on.
 So
 these
 liberties
 are
 there


in
 the
 British
 Constitution.
 The
 problem


is
 all
 of
 the
 laws
 that
 have
 been
 passed


since
 most
 notably
 the
 online
 safety


act.
 What
 we
 need
 to
 do
 is
 restore


Britain's
 historic
 liberties
 with
 a


great
 restoration
 bill
 that
 sweeps
 away


all
 of
 this
 legislation
 that
 is
 tied
 the


country
 in
 knots.
 And
 I've
 talked
 about,


you
 know,
 our
 problematic
 institutions,


the
 problems
 with
 the
 judiciary,
 the


problems
 with
 free
 speech.
 This
 is
 all


down
 to
 very
 poor
 quality
 legislation


that
 is
 essentially
 handed
 power
 that


used
 to
 sit
 in
 the
 hands
 of
 the


individual
 British
 citizen
 or
 the


British
 Parliament.
 It's
 handed
 those


power
 to
 unelected
 bureaucrats.


[Music]


Basically
 my
 entire
 professional
 career,


your
 party
 has
 been
 in
 power
 except
 for,


you
 know,
 the
 last
 10
 minutes
 or
 so
 when


uh
 Labor
 and
 Kirst


>> it
 doesn't
 feel
 like
 10
 minutes
 here.


>> Okay.
 Maybe
 it
 just
 feels
 like
 it
 over


here
 because
 it
 feels
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 the


rot
 you
 describe
 or
 what
 the
 rot
 that


you
 perceive
 in
 your
 country
 almost
 so


much
 of
 it
 seems
 to
 have
 taken
 place


under
 conservative
 government.
 Why
 is


that?
 And
 why
 would
 anyone
 you
 know
 and


they're
 thinking
 about
 the
 next


election.
 Why
 would
 anyone
 think
 that
 if


there
 so
 much
 rot
 was
 allowed
 to
 happen


under
 the
 Tories
 that
 the
 Tories
 should


be
 given
 another
 chance
 in
 power?


>> So
 I
 think
 the
 rot
 has
 sort
 of
 built
 up


over
 time.
 So
 I
 talked
 about
 the


development
 of
 the
 permanent


bureaucracy.
 You
 had
 the
 Atly
 government


which
 socialized
 land
 which
 created
 the


NHS
 which
 created
 the
 welfare
 state.
 A


lot
 of
 our
 problems
 go
 back
 to
 that


government.
 But
 what
 was
 very
 important


about
 the
 Blair
 government
 is
 this


taking
 power
 that
 was
 in
 the
 hands
 of


Parliament
 and
 putting
 it
 in
 the
 hands


of
 unelected


bodies,
 bureaucracies,
 the
 Bank
 of


England,
 the
 Judicial
 Appointments


Commission,
 all
 of
 this
 plethora
 of


people
 offcom
 who
 are
 now
 making
 the


decisions
 about
 free
 speech.
 These


plethora
 of
 people
 have
 not
 been
 elected


now
 de
 facto
 run
 our
 country.
 And
 the


big
 mistake
 the
 Conservative
 party
 made


was
 not
 reversing
 that.
 And
 this
 was


because
 at
 the
 time
 David
 Cameron
 said


he
 wanted
 to
 be
 the
 heir
 to
 Blair,
 you


know,
 he
 wanted
 to
 be
 fashionable.
 The


Conservatives
 wanted
 to
 be
 modern.
 But
 I


think
 it
 was
 a
 huge
 error
 and
 the


Conservative
 Party
 lost
 its
 soul.
 That's


what
 happened
 in
 the
 pursuit
 of
 power,


in
 the
 pursuit
 of
 trying
 to
 be
 modern.


The
 Conservative
 Party
 lost
 its
 soul.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 an
 open
 question
 about


whether
 or
 not
 the
 Conservative
 Party


can
 get
 its
 soul
 back
 or
 be
 replaced.


But
 certainly,


you
 know,
 where
 we
 are
 now,
 not
 enough


people
 are
 saying
 what
 really
 went
 wrong


over
 those
 14
 years.
 But
 the


Conservative
 Party
 failed
 to
 take
 on
 the


bureaucracy.
 These
 were
 not
 the


Conservative
 Party's
 policies.
 they
 were


just
 policies
 that
 we
 didn't
 object
 to.


>> Related
 to
 Joe's
 point,
 when
 you
 you


think
 back
 to
 certain
 moments
 in


Britain's
 economic
 history,
 so
 for


instance,
 Brexit,
 the
 argument
 then
 was


that
 if
 we
 get
 rid
 of
 all
 this
 EU


regulation,
 the
 UK
 economy
 will
 be
 free


to
 flourish
 and
 prosper.
 And
 I
 think
 in


the
 1970s,
 you
 know,
 Anthony
 Barber


instituted
 some
 tax
 cuts
 as
 well,
 right


before
 inflation
 hit,
 I
 think
 25%
 or


something
 like
 that.
 Why
 should
 the
 UK


population
 have
 confidence
 that
 a
 growth


focused
 economic
 policy,
 one
 that


features,
 you
 know,
 big
 tax
 cuts
 and


deregulation,
 will
 actually
 drive


economic
 growth?
 Well,
 I
 think
 the


important
 thing
 to
 note
 about
 about


Brexit
 is
 we
 haven't
 got
 rid
 of
 any
 of


those
 European
 laws.
 They're
 still
 on


the
 British
 statute
 books.
 So,
 laws
 that


protect
 bats
 and
 nutes
 still
 on
 the


statute
 books.
 Laws
 that
 tell
 you
 how


your
 can
 opener
 should
 work
 are
 still
 on


the
 statute
 books.
 We
 still
 have
 the


working
 time
 directive.
 It
 we
 still
 got


all
 of
 those
 laws.
 So,
 this
 goes
 back
 to


the
 problem
 you
 were
 talking
 about
 the


Conservative
 Party.
 The
 Conservative


Party
 is
 fundamentally
 split
 between


people
 who
 want
 Britain
 to
 be,
 you
 know,


Singapore
 on
 terms,
 you
 know,
 a
 free


trading,
 you
 know,
 go
 getting
 country


and
 people
 who
 want
 it
 to
 be
 part
 of


Europe
 and
 want
 to
 be
 part
 of
 the,
 you


know,
 European
 lots
 of
 labor
 laws


protecting
 people,
 you
 know,


environmental
 red
 tape,
 all
 of
 that


stuff.
 And
 that
 issue
 was
 never
 resolved


within
 the
 Conservative
 Party,
 which
 is


why,
 you
 know,
 you
 saw
 prime
 ministers


being
 deposed,
 why
 you
 have
 the
 debate


within
 the
 Conservative
 Party.
 And
 I


think
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 Brexit
 vote
 in


Britain,
 52%
 voted
 for
 Brexit,
 48%


didn't.
 So
 Brexit
 was
 not
 delivered
 as


the
 public
 intended.
 I
 mean
 the
 biggest


case
 in
 point
 is
 of
 course
 immigration


where
 the
 Boris
 Johnson
 government


failed
 to
 in
 fact
 allowed
 immigration
 to


increase
 huge
 amounts
 which
 has
 had
 a


very
 negative
 effect.
 You
 know,
 since


you
 mentioned
 party
 politics
 in
 the
 UK


and
 the
 split
 within
 the
 Conservative


Party,
 again,
 ignorant
 question
 here.
 I


do
 get
 the
 impression
 that
 the


Conservatives
 just
 like
 all
 seem
 to
 hate


each
 other
 more
 than
 the
 members
 of
 the


Labor
 Party
 and
 the
 1922
 committee,


which
 I
 still
 like
 have
 to
 Wikipedia


every
 once
 in
 a
 while
 to
 remember
 what


that
 is.
 And
 they're
 always
 like


scheming
 against
 each
 other.
 Is
 there


like
 a
 deeper
 culture
 of
 just
 internal


hate
 in
 the
 Conservative
 Party
 than
 the


Labor
 Party?
 I
 would
 say
 I
 would
 say
 the


problems
 of
 the
 Conservative
 party
 go


back
 to
 where
 Margaret
 Thatcher
 was


defenistrated


and
 the
 sort
 of
 Tory
 wets
 and
 the
 you


know
 the
 Thatcherites.
 But
 if
 you


compare
 it
 to
 American
 politics
 you
 know


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 split
 between
 people


like
 Trump
 and
 people
 like
 Dick
 Cheney


or
 the
 sort
 of
 Bush
 Republicans
 it's
 a


very
 similar


>> ideological
 divide.
 But
 what
 is


different
 in
 America
 is
 that
 Trump
 has


basically
 taken
 over
 the
 Republican


party
 whereas
 in
 Britain
 the
 kind
 of
 the


left
 of
 the
 conservative
 party
 are
 still


in
 control
 of
 it.
 That's
 the
 difference.


>> But
 there
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 political


realignment
 and
 you
 can
 see
 it
 in


America.
 Yeah.


>> You
 know,
 Republicans
 are
 now
 getting


votes
 from
 lowincome
 people,
 people
 in


rural
 areas.
 you
 the
 Democrats
 are


dominating
 in
 the
 sort
 of
 liberal


cities.


>> That's
 exactly
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 in


Britain
 at
 the
 next
 election.
 It's
 just


the
 Conservative
 Party
 hasn't
 really
 got


its
 head
 around
 which
 of
 those
 two


things
 it
 is.


>> So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 seems
 to
 be


happening
 in
 many
 developed
 countries
 at


the
 moment
 is
 everyone
 wants
 to
 boost


their
 own
 domestic
 manufacturing
 sector.


And
 I
 believe
 you've
 spoken
 about
 the


need
 for
 this
 in
 the
 UK
 before.
 When
 I


think
 about
 the
 British
 economy,
 I


usually
 think
 there's
 a
 pretty
 big


monopoly
 when
 it
 comes
 to,
 let's
 call


it,
 intellectual
 jobs,


>> services,
 finance,
 office,
 and


journalism.
 Yeah,


>> that
 kind
 of
 thing.
 But
 when
 I
 think


about
 British
 manufacturing,
 you
 know,


it's
 it's
 an
 island
 with
 a
 relatively


small
 population
 compared
 to
 some
 other


places
 in
 the
 world
 and
 high
 taxes,
 as


you've
 been
 pointing
 out.
 What
 would


make
 Britain
 actually
 competitive
 when


it
 comes
 to
 manufacturing
 at
 a
 time
 when


everyone
 seems
 out
 to
 uh
 compete
 in
 the


same
 field?


>> Well,
 the
 number
 one
 thing
 is
 energy


prices
 need
 to
 come
 down.
 You
 know,


they're
 the
 highest
 in
 the
 world.


They're
 four
 times
 the
 United
 States.
 If


you
 are
 a
 car
 manufacturer,
 a
 steel


manufacturer,
 it's
 incredibly
 hard
 to


compete.
 So,
 that's
 that
 has
 to
 change.


We
 have
 to
 make
 it
 much
 easier
 to
 build


things
 in
 Britain.
 if
 you
 want
 to
 build


a
 new
 factory,
 it
 takes
 far
 too
 long.


So,
 there
 are
 all
 of
 those
 sort
 of


supply
 side
 policies
 that
 need
 to


change.
 I
 think
 Britain,
 we


de-industrialized
 pretty
 much
 earlier


than
 any
 other
 country.
 You
 can
 see
 the


same
 thing
 now
 happening
 in
 Germany
 and


continental
 Europe.
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 do
 all
 you
 can
 to
 maintain


a
 manufacturing
 base
 because
 a
 lot
 of


industries
 like
 AI
 for
 example
 requires


high
 levels
 of
 energy.
 It
 requires
 other


industries
 that
 it
 can
 sort
 of
 feed
 off


if
 you
 like.
 So
 if
 you
 just
 become
 I
 I


talked
 about
 Singapore
 and
 TESS
 earlier


but
 Singapore
 is
 a
 relatively
 small


country
 so
 it
 can
 afford
 to
 be
 a
 trading


hub.
 Britain
 is
 a
 country
 of
 70
 million


people.
 I
 think
 you
 can't
 rely
 on


services
 alone.
 I
 think
 you
 have
 to


produce
 the
 full
 gamut.
 I'm
 very
 worried


that
 we're
 losing
 our
 last
 steel
 blast


furnace.
 Yeah.
 What
 we
 learned
 during
 co


is
 you
 are
 seriously
 up
 against
 it
 if


you
 are
 relying
 on
 you
 know
 China
 for


pharmaceuticals.


These
 are
 the
 types
 of
 industry
 that


Britain
 can
 excel
 in
 and
 does
 excel
 in.


I
 mean
 our
 biggest
 manufactured
 export


to
 the
 United
 States
 is
 cars.
 We
 do


produce
 good
 high-end
 cars
 that
 people


want
 to
 buy.
 So
 there
 are
 opportunities


for
 British
 manufacturing.
 It's
 just


been
 made
 very
 very
 hard
 by
 high
 energy


prices
 and
 our
 planning
 rules.


>> I
 take
 your
 point
 about
 certainly
 about


energy
 prices
 and
 planning
 rules.
 Many


people
 are
 having
 the
 same
 discussions


here
 to
 my
 mind
 and
 Tracy
 mentioned
 the


fairly
 small
 population.
 Scale
 is


incredibly
 important.


>> Still
 that
 small.
 I
 mean
 17
 million.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 China


has
 however
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 just
 in


the
 manufacturing.
 But
 yes,
 I
 take
 your


point.
 Not
 that
 small.
 But
 did
 Brexit


harm
 scale
 capacity?
 Because
 to
 my
 mind,


if
 we're
 thinking
 about,
 okay,
 mass


production
 at
 efficient
 level
 so
 that


it's
 like
 genuinely
 competitive,
 so
 that


it's
 not
 some
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,


government
 subsidized
 albatross
 that


just
 exists
 as
 a
 makework
 industry.
 It


strikes
 me
 that
 sheer
 scale
 of
 market
 is


very
 important
 and
 it
 feels
 to
 me
 like


Brexit
 has
 shrunk
 the
 scale
 of
 that


market
 for
 the


>> I
 mean,
 there's
 no
 there's
 no
 evidence


that
 exports
 to
 Europe
 have
 gone
 down


after
 Brexit.
 And
 in
 fact,
 you
 know,
 the


different
 trade
 deal
 we
 got
 from
 the
 EU


presents
 the
 UK
 with
 some
 opportunities


because
 we
 have
 lower
 tariffs
 in
 some


areas
 with
 the
 United
 States
 than
 the
 EU


does.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 other
 big
 factor


in
 manufacturing
 is
 so
 much
 of
 it
 is


becoming
 automated


>> that
 it
 makes
 economic
 sense
 for
 goods


to
 be
 produced
 close
 to
 market
 because


you're
 no
 longer
 getting
 the
 advantage


of
 a
 massive
 labor
 cost
 differential.


So,
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 just
 a
 natural


progression
 of
 modern
 economies
 that


more
 manufacturing
 is
 going
 to
 be
 done


closer
 to
 home
 when
 you've
 got
 a
 much


more
 automated
 process.


>> Since
 we're
 talking
 trade
 and
 exports,


uh
 the
 UK
 was
 one
 of
 the
 first


countries,
 I
 think,
 to
 sign
 an
 agreement


with
 the
 Trump
 administration
 on


tariffs.
 Would
 you
 have
 signed
 that
 so


quickly
 or
 would
 you
 have
 perhaps
 uh


pushed
 back
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 given,
 you


know,
 your
 emphasis
 on
 boosting


manufacturing
 domestically
 within
 the


UK?
 I
 did
 actually
 praise
 Kier
 Stalmer


for
 the
 deal
 at
 the
 time.
 I
 was
 one
 of


the
 few
 people
 to
 praise
 it
 and
 I
 said


because
 I've
 got
 experience
 of


negotiating
 with
 the
 first
 Trump


administration,
 Bob
 Lighheiser.
 So
 I


know
 how
 difficult
 it
 is
 and
 I
 thought


the
 UK
 got
 a
 good
 deal
 and
 so
 it
 has


proven
 that
 the
 EU
 is
 actually
 got
 a


worse
 deal
 than
 the
 UK
 got.
 So
 I
 thought


he
 was
 right.
 He
 was
 right
 to
 do
 that.


>> Why
 is
 that?
 And
 I
 want
 to
 see


>> well
 we
 are
 paying
 lower
 tariffs
 than


the
 EU
 is.


>> So
 just
 on
 a
 relative
 basis
 compared
 to


others
 on
 an
 absolute
 basis
 you're
 still


paying
 tariffs.


>> Yes.
 But
 what
 Trump
 has
 done
 with
 the


with
 all
 of
 his
 trade
 deals
 around
 the


world
 is
 essentially
 reset
 the
 World


Trade
 Organization.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 one


of
 the
 biggest
 errors
 that
 of
 American


for
 foreign
 policy
 when
 Clinton
 allowed


China
 to
 join
 the
 World
 Trade


Organization
 on
 developing
 country
 terms


and
 that
 has
 had
 a
 in
 my
 view
 a
 it's


helped
 boost
 China's
 economy.
 China
 is


an
 autocratic
 authoritarian
 regime.
 I


think
 that
 was
 a
 a
 disastrous
 policy.


What
 Trump
 is
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 reset


that.
 And
 that
 has
 inevitable


consequences
 for
 all
 of
 America's


trading
 partners.
 But
 knowing
 what
 I
 do


about
 the
 Trump
 administration,
 I


thought
 the
 deal
 Kiss
 Armor
 got
 was
 a


good
 deal.


>> Potentially
 one
 thing
 that
 could
 um


>> and
 I
 don't
 praise
 him
 very
 often,
 by


the
 way.
 I
 figured
 praise
 him.


>> I
 figured
 that's
 rare.
 Um,
 one
 thing


that
 theoretically
 could
 be
 done
 to


lower
 energy
 prices
 for
 in
 many
 places


would
 be
 a
 resolution
 of
 the
 war
 in


Ukraine.
 And
 I'm
 curious
 what
 when
 you


look
 at
 either
 Trump's
 pursuits
 or
 what


Kirst
 has
 said,
 do
 you
 see
 other
 paths?


Were
 you
 the
 prime
 minister
 now,
 what


would
 you
 be
 pushing
 for
 in
 that


particular
 conflict?


>> Well,
 I
 want
 what
 I
 want
 out
 of
 that


conflict
 is
 I
 want
 Putin
 not
 to
 have


been
 rewarded
 for
 his
 appalling
 invasion


of
 Ukraine.
 So
 what
 we
 don't
 want
 is
 him


or
 indeed
 Xi
 Jinping
 to
 get
 the
 signal


from
 the
 resolution
 of
 the
 Ukraine


conflict
 that
 this
 was
 a
 this
 invasion


was
 somehow
 justified
 or
 worth
 it.
 I


want
 Russia
 to
 be


contained
 because
 I
 still
 believe
 that


they
 have
 expansionist
 instincts.


Just
 going
 back
 to
 the
 mini
 budget
 for
 a


second,
 one
 of
 the
 components
 of
 that


was
 government
 support
 to
 offset
 higher


energy
 prices.
 And
 that
 was
 also
 one
 of


the
 things
 that
 seemed
 to
 spook
 markets.


This
 idea
 that
 the
 UK
 government
 would


be
 fiscally
 on
 the
 hook
 to
 compensate


for
 astronomical
 energy
 prices
 at
 the


time
 that
 seemed
 to
 be
 expanding
 at
 an


enormous
 rate.
 If
 you
 were
 going
 to
 do


it
 all
 over
 again,
 would
 you
 have


possibly
 included
 some
 sort
 of
 mechanism


to
 maybe
 limit
 the
 cost
 or,
 you
 know,


avoid
 the
 sense
 that
 the
 UK
 was


basically
 bailing
 out
 its
 population
 in


some
 way?


>> It's
 important
 to
 note
 that
 the
 energy


package
 was
 one
 thing
 that
 wasn't


reversed.
 So,
 that
 was
 not
 the
 policy.


The
 policy
 that
 I
 was
 forced
 to
 res


reversed
 now
 was
 made
 pretty
 clear
 to
 me


pretty
 much
 you
 know
 through
 threats
 was


the
 corporation
 tax
 increase.
 The
 energy


policy
 remained
 in
 place.
 The
 energy


policy
 remained
 in
 place.
 And
 the
 point


about
 the
 energy
 policy
 was
 it
 was
 not
 a


subsidy
 that
 happened
 automatically.
 It


was
 only
 when
 energy
 prices
 reached
 a


certain
 level.
 And
 I
 believed
 it
 was


right
 for
 the
 government
 to
 do
 that


because
 the
 government
 had
 failed
 to


ensure


adequately
 cheap
 energy
 was
 supplied.


But
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 in
 tandem
 with
 that


policy
 of
 essentially
 ensuring
 people


against
 very
 high
 energy
 prices
 was


getting
 on
 with
 fracking,


licensing
 new
 North
 Sea
 gas
 reserves
 so


the
 prices
 would
 never
 get
 that
 high.
 So


it
 was
 an
 insurance
 against
 prices
 going


high
 to
 give
 consumers
 and
 businesses


confidence
 to
 invest
 whilst
 we
 sorted


out
 the
 supply
 that
 had
 been
 so
 badly


failed
 by
 previous
 governments.
 That
 was


the
 intention
 of
 the
 policy.
 And
 as
 I've


said,
 the
 policy
 wasn't
 reversed
 by
 my


successor.
 The
 policy
 that
 was
 reversed


was
 getting
 on
 with
 the
 fracking.
 So
 you


had
 the
 energy
 insurance
 policy,
 but
 not


the
 fracking
 policy.
 Those
 policies
 were


designed
 in
 tandem
 so
 that
 we
 can
 make


sure
 that
 businesses
 in
 the
 country


weren't
 spooked
 by
 the
 threats
 of
 having


skyhigh
 energy
 prices.
 And
 by
 the
 way,


if
 the
 energy
 prices
 had
 got
 that
 high,


there
 would
 have
 had
 to
 be
 some
 kind
 of


package
 to
 deal
 with
 them.
 Anyway,
 what


I
 was
 doing
 is
 giving
 people
 notice
 so


they
 had
 the
 confidence
 to
 invest.
 The


energy
 package
 was
 actually
 announced


because
 very
 sadly
 her
 majesty
 the
 queen


died.
 It
 was
 announced
 a
 few
 weeks


beforehand.
 It
 wasn't
 announced
 at
 the


time
 of
 the
 mini
 budget.
 The
 thing
 that


the
 the
 economic
 establishment
 really


objected
 to
 in
 the
 mini
 budget
 was
 the


taxes.
 It
 was
 the
 you
 know,
 it
 was
 not


raising
 corporation
 tax.
 That's
 what


they
 didn't
 like.


>> I
 just
 have
 one
 last
 question.
 You
 know,


Tracy
 and
 I
 work
 in
 public,
 though
 not


as
 public
 as
 having
 been
 the
 prime


minister
 of
 the
 UK.


We
 live
 in
 this
 age
 where
 people,
 you


know,
 stories
 go
 insane
 and
 people
 love


to
 see
 someone
 publicly
 humiliated.
 And


it
 just
 seems
 to
 me
 that
 the
 UK
 press
 in


particular
 is
 a
 bunch
 of
 jackals.
 But


that's
 just
 my
 impression
 over
 here,


even
 relative
 to
 the
 press
 over.


>> It's
 always
 funny
 when
 Americans
 come


over
 and
 they
 don't
 realize
 what
 they're


like.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 you
 ain't
 seen


nothing
 until
 you've
 dealt
 with
 the
 UK


press.
 And
 they
 always
 go,
 Liz,
 you
 were


right.
 You
 were
 right
 about
 these


people.


>> No,
 I
 just
 see
 in
 the
 headlines.
 I
 It's


I
 don't know.
 It
 seems
 obvious
 to
 me.


What's
 your
 le
 takeaway?
 How
 do
 you
 move


past
 a
 period
 of
 one's
 life
 like
 that?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 really
 see
 it
 like
 that.
 I


just
 see
 that
 the
 British
 press
 needs
 to


change.
 And
 I'm
 a
 big
 supporter
 of


independent
 media.
 I
 think
 the
 British


press's
 coverage
 of
 economics
 is


appalling.
 I
 think
 their
 coverage
 of


politics
 is
 skin
 deep.
 I
 don't
 think


they've
 done
 anything
 to
 analyze
 the


sort
 of
 failings
 of
 the
 British
 state.


And


you
 know
 I
 think
 there
 won't
 be
 serious


we
 don't
 just
 need
 to
 change
 the


bureaucracy
 in
 this
 country.
 We
 need
 to


deal
 and
 change
 the
 press
 and
 you
 know


people
 are
 now
 turning
 off
 the
 BBC.
 You


know
 they're
 turning
 off
 the
 mainstream


media
 because
 they
 can
 see
 that
 the


truth
 isn't
 being
 told.
 And
 you
 know


there
 used
 to
 be
 a
 golden
 age
 I
 guess
 in


journalism
 where
 people
 cared
 about
 the


truth.
 I'm
 afraid
 they
 don't
 now.


friends
 of
 mine
 who
 are
 journalists
 just


say
 their
 editorial
 conferences
 about


how
 many
 clicks
 their
 article
 gets
 and


it's,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 think
 that's


pathetic.


>> Well,
 these
 are
 the
 tensions
 of
 being
 a


journalist
 in
 modern
 times.
 But
 I
 have


one
 more
 question.
 It's
 just
 going
 back


to
 um
 some
 technical
 aspects,
 I
 guess,


of
 economic
 policy.
 So
 you've
 criticized


the
 OBR
 for
 you
 know
 its
 forecasts
 that


end
 up
 influencing
 or
 you
 know
 perhaps


even
 dictating
 government
 policy.
 I


guess
 my
 question
 is,
 you
 know,
 when
 you


think
 about
 a
 progrowth
 economic
 agenda,


that
 also
 relies
 on
 forecasts
 about


future
 growth.
 And
 when
 we
 talked
 to
 uh


Steven
 Myron
 from
 the
 Trump


administration
 earlier
 this
 year,
 that


was
 one
 takeaway
 from
 our
 conversation


was
 how
 much
 the
 Trump
 administration


was
 really
 betting
 on
 economic
 growth


picking
 up
 in
 order
 to
 offset
 some
 of


the
 stuff
 it
 was
 doing.


>> It's
 the
 only
 strategy.
 It
 is
 the
 only


strategy.
 But
 why
 should
 people
 have


confidence
 in
 the
 growth
 forecast
 but


not
 have
 confidence
 in
 you
 know
 OBR


forecasts?
 But
 the
 point
 about
 the
 OBR,


and
 this
 has
 been
 proven
 by
 history,
 is


that
 they
 overestimate
 how
 much
 raising


taxes
 will
 bring
 in
 in
 revenue
 because


they
 don't
 take
 a
 full
 the
 full
 account


of
 the
 depression
 in
 economic
 activity


and
 they
 underestimate


the
 impact
 of
 supply
 side
 reforms
 like


planning
 or
 fracking
 or
 whatever
 else.


And


you
 know,
 there
 are
 two
 answers
 to
 this.


One
 is


there
 are
 better
 economists
 out
 there


and
 I
 think
 the
 government
 as
 was
 the


case
 prior
 to
 2010
 the
 government
 should


have
 the
 ability
 to
 hire
 the
 economists


that
 you
 know
 they
 believe
 are
 right
 you


know
 I
 don't
 think
 my
 homework
 should
 be


marked
 by
 somebody
 who
 doesn't
 agree


with
 me
 which
 was
 what
 was
 happening
 I


think
 that's
 just
 wrong
 if
 people
 don't


like
 what
 I'm
 saying
 and
 they
 don't
 like


the
 policies
 they
 can
 vote
 me
 out
 at
 an


election
 But
 I
 wasn't
 even
 allowed
 to


try
 the
 policies
 because
 the
 people


marking
 my
 homework
 said
 no.
 I
 mean,


that's
 the
 bottom
 line.
 But
 the
 second


thing
 is
 I
 think
 we're
 far
 too
 reliant


on
 forecasts.
 You
 can't
 predict
 the


future.
 And
 trying
 to
 say,
 which
 is
 what


the
 UK
 system
 does,
 that
 five
 years
 out


we
 know
 exactly
 what
 the
 debt
 is
 going


to
 be
 is
 rubbish.
 You
 know,
 we
 don't


know
 what
 if
 Donald
 Trump
 imposes
 huge


tariffs.
 What
 if
 the
 UK
 strikes
 a
 trade


deal
 with
 India?
 You
 know,
 what
 if


there's
 a
 discovery
 of
 a
 new
 technology


that
 totally
 transform?
 You
 don't
 know


what
 the
 future's
 going
 to
 look
 like.


And
 my
 economics
 is
 based
 on
 first


principles.
 I
 know
 that
 if
 you
 put
 up


taxes
 too
 high,
 people
 won't
 go
 out
 to


work
 anymore.
 I
 know
 that
 if
 you
 make


energy
 prices
 cheaper,
 businesses
 are


more
 likely
 to
 invest
 in
 Britain.
 The


problem
 with
 these
 forecasts,
 and
 this


is
 another
 criticism
 of
 British
 economic


media,
 the
 problem
 with
 forecasts
 is


that
 people
 become
 focused
 on
 whether


the
 numbers
 right
 in
 the
 forecast
 rather


than
 the
 fundamental
 principles
 of
 what


makes
 a
 successful
 economy.


>> Liz
 Truss,
 so
 great
 to
 chat
 with
 you.


Someone
 we've
 wanted
 to
 have
 on
 the
 show


for
 a
 very
 long
 time.
 Great
 that
 we've


made
 it
 happen
 and
 appreciate
 you
 coming


on
 up.


>> Thank
 you.


[Music]


Tracy,
 I'm
 so
 glad
 we
 finally
 got
 to


interview
 Liz
 Trust.


>> We
 finally
 did
 it.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 good


time
 to
 do
 it
 actually
 because
 there's,


you
 know,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 overlap
 with


the
 Trump
 administration
 at
 the
 moment


and
 what
 Truss
 experienced
 in
 2022.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 No,
 I
 mean
 there
 was
 a
 lot


that
 I
 found
 to
 be
 interesting
 there.


You
 know what
 I
 think
 actually
 maybe
 the


most
 interesting
 thing
 to
 me
 is
 thinking


that
 okay
 in
 the
 US
 we
 have
 these


multiple
 branches
 of
 government
 right
 so


the
 president
 wants
 something
 but


congress
 is
 going
 to
 veto
 it
 or
 can
 veto


it
 especially
 if
 it's
 a
 different
 party


in
 power
 obviously
 that's
 not
 the


dynamic
 of
 the
 UK
 with
 a
 parliamentary


system
 and
 yet
 even
 in
 the
 parliamentary


system
 to
 hear
 this
 trust
 describe
 the


fact
 that
 what
 she
 describes
 as
 even


modest
 cuts
 to
 the
 increase
 in
 welfare


weren't
 palatable
 to
 the
 members
 of
 her


party
 let
 alone
 the
 opposition
 which
 of


course
 is
 never
 going
 to
 vote
 for
 but
 in


her
 party
 I
 find
 that
 to
 be
 a
 very


striking
 comment
 about
 the
 difficulty


that
 you
 know
 electoral
 democracies
 have


in
 reigning
 back
 cuts.


>> Oh
 absolutely.
 The
 other
 thing
 that
 kind


of
 caught
 my
 eye
 or
 my
 ear
 was
 when
 we


were
 talking
 about
 tariffs
 and
 you
 know


uh
 Liz
 said
 that
 she
 had
 praised
 um
 the


deal
 that
 the
 UK
 struck
 with
 the
 Trump


administration
 because
 it
 was
 less
 than


what
 the
 EU
 was
 paying.
 And
 it's


interesting
 to
 me
 that
 like
 countries


seem
 to
 be
 competing
 with
 each
 other.


You
 know,
 the
 Trump
 administration
 in


some
 respects
 has
 been
 kind
 of


successful
 in
 that
 getting
 its
 trade


partners
 to
 compete
 with
 each
 other
 for


the
 lowest
 deal
 rather
 than
 to,
 you


know,
 try
 to
 compete
 on
 an
 absolute


basis
 for
 lower
 tariffs
 per
 se.
 I


thought
 that
 was
 interesting.
 I
 also


think
 it's
 uh
 interesting
 you
 know
 this


sort
 of
 I
 find
 myself
 having
 a
 lot
 of


sympathy
 with
 this
 this
 sort
 of
 like


anti-democratic
 aspects
 of
 entities
 like


the
 OBR
 or
 in
 the
 US
 the
 OM
 and
 these


idea
 that
 okay
 they
 have
 one
 set
 of


assumptions
 about
 how
 policy
 works
 and


the
 idea
 that
 like
 they
 have
 a
 formal


role
 and
 you
 know
 there's
 there
 is
 a


certain
 undemocratic
 element
 I
 think
 of


these
 sort
 of
 institutions
 that
 either


they
 not
 necessarily
 with
 a
 formal
 veto,


etc.
 that
 aren't
 elected.
 I
 have


sympathy
 for
 that
 opinion.


>> It
 certainly
 seems
 like
 they
 can
 act
 as


an
 institutional
 restraint
 on
 the


government,
 but
 some
 people
 would
 argue


that
 maybe
 that's
 a
 good
 thing.


>> No,
 right.
 Like
 today,


>> an
 independent
 body
 looking
 at
 economic


policy
 and
 monetary
 policy,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 that's
 the
 thing.
 And


look,
 it's
 very
 striking
 that
 she
 said


really
 she
 does
 not
 accept
 the
 premise


that
 the
 Bank
 of
 England
 should
 be
 as


independent
 as
 it
 currently
 is.
 and
 that


you
 know
 the
 idea
 as
 you
 to
 your


question
 folding
 it
 back
 in
 with
 the


treasury
 is
 very
 striking.


>> Well,
 also
 the
 line
 about
 you
 know
 not


wanting
 to
 have
 her
 homework
 marked
 by


someone
 who
 doesn't
 believe
 in
 it.
 I'm


sure
 all
 of
 us
 as
 students
 would
 have


liked
 to
 choose
 our
 own
 teacher
 who
 was


grading
 our
 homework,
 but
 we
 don't
 get


to
 for
 obvious
 reasons.


>> We
 don't.


>> Shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?
