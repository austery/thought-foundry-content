Working
 with
 Claude
 is
 just
 such
 a


delight.
 It
 just
 feels
 so
 steerable
 and


I
 think
 the
 one
 thing
 it
 really
 has
 is


intent
 understanding.
 When
 I
 wanted
 to


dig
 deep,
 it
 just
 does
 it
 and
 it's


really
 enabled
 me
 to
 build
 a
 little


ecosystem
 of
 my
 own
 tools
 around
 it.


>> I
 think
 environment
 setup
 and
 developer


setup
 is
 such
 an
 underappreciated
 use


case.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 know
 you


really
 care
 about
 is
 effective
 planning


and
 you've
 come
 up
 with
 a
 way
 that
 you


do
 your
 planning
 that
 I
 think
 is
 pretty


unique.
 So,
 I've
 played
 around
 with
 this


tool
 to
 basically
 give
 Claude
 these
 JSON


files.
 And
 there's
 a
 whole
 set
 of
 skills


I've
 built
 around
 this
 that
 Claude
 Code


can
 use
 to
 write
 these
 out.
 And
 then


these
 actually
 end
 up
 generating
 nice


looking
 UI
 mockups.
 I
 will
 say
 this
 is


the
 dev
 tool
 that
 was
 almost
 100%


prompted.

CJ,
 welcome
 to
 How
 I
 AI.


>> Thanks,
 Claire.
 It's
 good
 to
 be
 here.


>> So,
 I've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 Claude
 and
 AI


engineering
 power
 users,
 and
 I
 still


think
 you're
 like
 a
 super
 power
 user
 of


some
 of
 these
 tools.
 And
 it's
 not
 just


because
 you're
 creating
 real
 production


code
 with
 what
 you're
 building,
 which
 is


really
 nice
 to
 see,
 and
 I
 think
 a
 subset


of
 what
 we're
 seeing
 out
 of
 folks
 using


these
 tools.
 You
 also
 build
 tools
 for


yourself
 to
 make
 the
 process
 of
 AI


engineering
 better
 and
 you
 share
 those


tools
 with
 other
 people
 who
 then


validate
 that
 they're
 actually
 helpful.


So
 why
 are
 you
 so
 excited
 about
 in


particular
 Claude
 Code
 and
 what
 has
 it


changed
 for
 you
 as
 as
 we
 were
 talking


before
 the
 show
 a
 quote
 unquote
 real


software
 engineer?


>> Like
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 the
 Opus
 4.5
 moment


was
 a
 big
 one.
 Um,
 but
 I've
 been
 on


cloud
 code,
 I
 don't know,
 maybe
 last


May.
 But
 for
 me,
 it
 was
 really
 about
 the


harness
 they
 have
 and
 like
 I
 see
 a
 lot


of
 arguments
 about
 codecs
 in
 cloud
 code.


And
 I'd
 honestly
 argue
 GPT
 5.2
 is
 a


smarter
 model,
 but
 like
 working
 with


claude
 is
 just
 such
 a
 delight
 like
 in


cloud
 code.


It
 just
 feels
 so
 like
 steerable.
 And
 I


think
 the
 one
 thing
 it
 really
 has
 is


like
 intent
 understanding.


Maybe
 I'm
 not
 giving,
 you
 know,
 opus
 and


cursor
 like
 the
 the
 shot
 it
 deserves


here,
 but
 there's
 something
 about


include
 code
 like
 when
 I
 wanted
 to
 dig


deep,
 it
 just
 it
 just
 does
 it.
 It
 feels


to
 like
 pick
 up
 on
 my
 intuition
 just
 in


the
 prompts.
 Um,
 and
 it's
 really
 enabled


me
 to
 almost
 like
 build
 a
 little


ecosystem
 of
 my
 own
 tools
 around
 it


around
 cla
 code
 kind
 of
 particularly


with
 skills
 now
 um
 that
 just
 like
 keep


making
 it
 better
 and
 better
 for
 me


because
 it's
 claude
 code
 plus
 like
 this


system
 of
 skills
 and
 tools
 that
 um
 I've


built
 around
 it.
 So
 it's
 it's
 like


really
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 get
 out
 of
 it.


>> Yeah.
 What
 I
 love
 about
 this
 moment
 as
 a


software
 engineer
 is,
 you
 know,
 back
 in


the
 in
 the
 olden
 days,
 you
 sort
 of
 had


like
 your
 choice
 of
 like
 what's
 going
 to


be
 my
 IDE
 and
 am
 I
 going
 to
 use
 Vim
 and


like
 what,
 you
 know,
 what
 are
 my
 my
 set


of
 approved
 tools
 as
 an
 engineer
 that
 I


can
 use
 to
 make,
 you
 know,
 what
 llinters


are
 we
 using
 as
 a
 team?
 All
 this
 kind
 of


stuff.
 Like
 there's
 stuff
 that
 you
 could


do
 to
 customize
 your
 developer


environment.
 But
 now
 you
 can
 really
 take


it
 to
 the
 next
 level
 and
 you
 could
 have


a
 totally
 different
 AI
 engineering


workflow
 than
 your
 colleague
 sitting


next
 to
 you
 and
 it's
 totally
 fine


because
 it's
 making
 you
 individually
 a


lot
 more
 efficient
 and
 effective
 and


you're
 building
 them
 yourselves
 for


pretty
 cheap.
 So
 there's
 not
 that
 cost


or
 that
 hurdle
 of
 evaluating
 new
 things


in
 your
 stack.


>> Yeah.
 There's
 even
 like
 it's
 almost
 like


one
 you
 now
 have
 the
 brains
 of
 Claude
 to


almost
 like
 do
 some
 dirty
 work
 on
 the


dev
 tooling.
 Like
 I
 think
 you
 know
 pre


any
 of
 kind
 of
 the
 newer
 gen
 models
 that


just
 really
 can
 handle
 the
 agentic
 loop


and
 you
 know
 sitting
 with
 like
 a
 broken


llinter
 and
 just
 accepting
 it
 and
 having


like
 ignore
 comments
 everywhere
 so
 that


you
 know
 I
 just
 I
 just
 would
 give
 up
 and


now
 it's
 like
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 can
 almost


trust
 it
 to
 be
 like
 what's
 wrong
 with


this
 config?
 My
 IDE
 isn't
 matching


what's
 in
 the
 project.
 Okay,
 we
 have
 to


resolve
 this
 and
 just
 kind
 of
 solving


those
 like
 chore
 problems
 that
 I
 feel


like
 previously
 just
 ended
 up
 being


forever
 problems.


>> Yeah.
 And
 for
 the
 non-engineers
 watching


or
 listening
 right
 now,
 I
 think


environment
 setup
 and
 developer
 setup
 is


such
 an
 underappreciated
 use
 case.


Yesterday,
 I
 onboarded
 a
 designer
 who


had
 literally
 has
 kind
 of
 like
 sat
 out


some
 of
 this
 AI
 stuff.
 It's
 literally


not
 downloaded
 anything,
 used
 anything.


And
 she's
 on
 cursor,
 claude
 code,
 nodes


running,
 homebrews
 installed.
 And
 I
 was


like,
 just
 ask


>> Claude
 code
 to
 do
 it.
 Say
 like,
 help
 me


understand
 this
 repo
 and
 get
 my
 computer


set
 up
 to
 run


>> and
 it
 just
 and
 I
 said
 and
 then
 just


tell
 it
 it
 can
 accept
 all
 tools
 and
 let


it
 go
 and
 come
 back
 to
 your
 laptop


later.


>> And
 it's
 pretty
 great.
 I
 mean,
 we're


really
 really
 spoiled
 right
 now.
 So,


let's
 dive
 into
 some
 of
 your
 actual


workflows.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I


know
 you
 really
 care
 about
 is
 effective


planning
 and
 you've
 come
 up
 with
 a
 way


that
 you
 do
 your
 planning
 that
 I
 think


is
 pretty
 unique.


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 kind
 of
 the
 classic


plan.
 So
 I'm
 going
 to
 swap
 over
 to


cursor
 here.
 I
 have
 in
 this
 just
 like


your
 classic
 plans
 folder
 just
 throwing


plans
 in
 here.
 And


I
 really
 love
 this
 format.
 I
 think
 a
 lot


of
 people
 are
 kind
 of
 converging
 on
 this


of
 like
 iterating
 on
 markdown,
 having


one
 file
 where
 you're
 just
 like
 working


through
 the
 plan,
 reviewing
 the
 plan,


and
 by
 the
 end
 of
 that,
 you
 can
 almost


feel
 confident
 just
 letting
 it
 write
 the


code.
 But
 the
 one
 like
 piece
 that
 I


hated
 that
 I
 found
 really
 valuable
 was


these
 asy
 flowcharts.
 So,
 if
 you're
 just


listening,
 it's
 all
 those
 like
 boxes
 and


arrows
 that
 Claude
 draws
 and,
 you
 know,


there's
 always
 the
 ones
 where
 this
 one


actually
 looks
 pretty
 clean.
 Yeah,


there's
 always
 this
 like
 misalignment
 of


that
 edge
 character.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 we


haven't
 figured
 that
 out
 yet.
 But
 for


things
 like
 UI
 mockups,
 things
 like,
 you


know,
 flowcharts
 of
 how
 navigation's


going
 to
 work,
 how
 a
 certain
 system
 is


going
 to
 work,
 I
 really
 like
 this
 visual


way
 to
 think
 about
 things,
 but
 I
 really


hate
 staring
 at
 these
 asy
 like
 diagrams.


even
 things
 kind
 of
 like
 mermaid
 and


everything
 just
 didn't
 feel
 exactly
 what


I
 was
 going
 for.
 So,
 I've
 played
 around


with
 this
 tool
 to
 basically
 give


Claude


these
 JSON
 files.
 And
 there's
 a
 whole


set
 of
 skills
 I've
 built
 around
 this


that
 Cloud
 Code
 can
 use
 to
 write
 these


out.
 And
 then
 these
 actually
 end
 up


generating


nice
 looking
 UI
 mockups.
 Not
 in
 super


high
 fidelity
 or
 detail,
 but
 you
 know,
 I


can
 kind
 of
 guide
 it
 the
 direction
 I


need.
 And
 up
 here,
 these
 this
 white
 text


might
 be
 a
 little
 hard
 to
 see.
 But


basically,
 this
 is
 a
 flowchart
 on
 this


tool,
 Flowy,
 and
 how
 it
 works.


>> So
 for
 for
 the
 listeners,
 what
 I
 love


about
 this
 is
 Flowy
 is
 a
 tool
 that
 you


built.
 This
 isn't
 you're
 saying
 like,


"Oh,
 I
 was
 playing
 with
 this
 tool."
 It's


like,
 no,
 you
 built
 this
 tool.
 Yeah,


>> for
 yourself.


>> This
 was
 um
 this
 was
 my
 first
 experiment


with
 a
 Ralph
 loop.
 I'm
 still
 not
 certain


how
 confident
 I
 am
 in
 them
 because
 I
 had


to
 do
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 cleanup,
 but


overall
 I
 will
 say
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 dev


tool
 that
 was
 almost
 100%
 prompted.


>> Yeah.
 And
 so
 what
 you
 said
 is,
 you
 know,


I
 love
 plans.
 I
 love
 the
 idea
 and
 and
 I


just
 have
 to
 take
 a
 minute
 again.
 I'm


the
 oldest
 lady
 on
 the
 internet.
 So
 way


back
 in
 in
 the
 day,
 two
 decades
 ago
 when


I
 was
 first
 doing
 um
 product
 management


and
 web
 design,
 we
 did
 so
 many


flowcharts,
 so
 many
 user
 journey
 charts


and
 then
 so
 many
 wireframes
 and
 so
 many


like
 lowfidelity
 mocks
 than
 highfidelity


mocks.
 And
 what
 I
 love
 about
 what
 you're


building
 is
 you're
 building
 the
 AI


native
 version
 of
 that.
 That
 piece
 has


not
 gone
 away
 for
 anybody.
 It
 hasn't


gone
 away
 that
 you
 said
 like
 when
 you


click
 this
 it
 goes
 to
 this
 and
 these
 are


the
 steps
 and
 these
 are
 the
 branches
 and


all
 that.
 And
 it
 hasn't
 gone
 a
 way
 that


you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 designs
 and
 say,


"Yeah,
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 I
 want."
 But


now
 you
 can
 have
 AI
 create
 them.
 And
 at


first
 you
 had
 a
 create
 AI
 create
 them
 in


markdown
 very
 very
 low
 fidelity.
 And
 I


have
 to
 take
 a
 side
 journey
 that
 you


know
 a
 year
 ago
 I
 was
 like
 extremely


delighted
 that
 it
 was
 making
 ASKI


markups
 and
 now
 it's
 just
 not
 good


enough.


>> Yeah.


>> The
 shifting
 expectations
 on
 these


models.


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 And
 so
 you've
 taken
 these


markdown
 markups
 that
 were
 useful
 and


you
 said
 now
 make
 them
 really
 useful
 by


building
 this
 sub
 application
 um
 that


can
 run
 them
 for
 you.
 And
 it's
 a


combination
 of
 it
 seems
 like
 workflow


diagrams
 and
 step-by-step


mockups.


>> Yeah.
 So
 there's
 kind
 of
 basically
 what


I
 wanted
 was
 JSON
 file.
 It
 can
 render


and
 it
 can
 have
 nodes
 and
 edges
 like
 any


flowchart
 and
 then


roughly
 be
 able
 to
 stack
 them,
 change


the
 colors
 and
 get
 us,
 you
 know,


something
 that
 looks
 like
 this
 where
 we


have
 a
 couple
 different
 screens
 and
 we


have
 these


somewhere
 between
 a
 wireframe
 and
 a
 true


mockup
 that
 just
 can
 help
 me
 point
 the


model
 in
 the
 right
 direction.
 Um,
 the


other
 big
 thing
 for
 me
 was
 iterating
 on


this.
 I'm
 not
 gonna
 go
 in
 that
 markdown


file
 and
 try
 to
 like
 write
 new
 shapes


and
 combine
 them.
 Um,
 so
 for
 this,
 this


is
 also
 an
 editor
 and
 as
 you
 edit
 it,


all
 these
 changes
 save
 to
 that
 JSON


file.
 So
 you
 can
 then
 point
 Claude
 back


at
 it
 and
 say,
 "Hey,
 I
 know
 you
 did


this,
 but
 actually
 let's
 say
 I
 want
 to


step
 here
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 bring
 this
 up


and
 add
 some
 edges."
 And
 then
 you
 can
 be


designing
 in
 here
 almost
 like
 you're
 in


Figma
 or
 Excaligar
 or
 something
 and
 then


cloud
 can
 just
 read
 the
 file
 and
 that's


like
 a
 more
 native
 way
 for
 it
 to


understand
 what
 everything
 looks
 like.


>> And
 you
 mentioned
 mermaid
 diagrams
 and


so
 I
 have
 this
 question
 which
 is
 one
 of


the
 benefits
 of
 mermaid
 diagrams
 is


that's
 a
 syntax
 that
 these
 LLMs
 know


well
 and
 can
 parse
 and
 actually
 reason


about.
 Do
 you
 feel
 like
 have
 you
 created


a
 skill
 where
 claude
 code
 can
 understand


and
 read
 this
 JSON?
 like
 how
 did
 you


train
 it
 to
 read
 your
 kind
 of


proprietary
 dev
 tool
 and
 documentation?


>> Yeah,
 so
 right
 now
 there's
 two
 main


skills
 I
 use.
 There's
 a
 third
 one
 that's


just
 an
 overview
 basically
 kind
 of
 the


highle
 view
 of
 what
 the
 commands
 are,


what
 a
 what
 a
 flowy
 file
 would
 look


like.
 And
 then
 I
 have
 one
 that's
 very


specific
 about
 flowcharts
 and
 one
 that's


about
 UI
 mockups.
 And
 to
 make
 these
 I


basically
 sat
 with
 sat
 in
 the
 repo
 of


the
 tool
 itself
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 like


explore
 sub
 aents
 going
 and
 then
 started


to
 make
 the
 first
 UI
 mockups
 and
 the


flowcharts
 and
 started
 to
 guided
 on
 okay


you
 put
 these
 too
 close
 we
 need
 a
 rule


about
 like
 spacing
 and
 how
 to
 think


about
 spacing
 and
 just
 incrementally


I've
 been
 building
 that
 up
 where
 if
 I'm


working
 with
 this
 and
 something
 goes


wrong
 almost
 an
 example
 here
 would
 be


this
 white
 text
 on
 these,
 you
 know,


pastel
 notes,
 kind
 of
 hard
 to
 read.
 I


would
 essentially
 hop
 into
 the
 place


where
 I
 have
 these
 skills,
 and
 say,


"Here's
 what
 happened.
 Give
 me
 a


suggestion
 on
 how
 to
 improve
 this
 skill


so
 this
 doesn't
 happen
 again."
 And
 then


iteratively
 just
 keep
 building
 that


skill.
 And
 the
 first
 flowcharts
 this


thing
 made
 were,
 you
 know,
 shapes


stacked
 on
 top
 of
 each
 other.
 It
 didn't


make
 any
 sense.
 Um,
 but
 it's
 come
 a
 long


way.


not
 much
 without
 many
 changes
 to
 like


the
 underlying
 app.
 It's
 really
 just


been
 about
 like
 getting
 Claude
 to


understand
 and
 know
 the
 skill.
 Um,
 and
 I


find
 that
 works
 better
 than
 something


like
 Mermaid
 just
 because


I
 really
 feel
 the
 power
 of
 building
 my


own
 dev
 tools
 now.
 And
 that


>> I
 I
 really
 don't
 want
 to
 hit
 the


constraints
 of
 Mermaid,
 if
 that
 makes


sense.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 say,
 "Okay,


I
 want
 a
 new
 feature
 in
 Flowey.
 I'm


going
 to
 build
 it.
 I'm
 going
 to
 update


skills
 and
 I
 can
 be
 confident
 that


Claude
 can
 actually
 work
 with
 that
 and


understand
 the
 new
 feature."


>> Yeah.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I've
 really


observed
 in
 myself
 as
 a
 engineer
 is
 as


more
 and
 more
 as
 I
 access
 more
 and
 more


of
 my
 dev
 tools
 through
 like
 an
 MCP
 or


config
 as
 code
 or
 any
 of
 these
 things,
 I


start
 to
 realize
 it's
 very
 easy
 for
 me


to
 extend
 what
 they've
 built
 and


customize
 it
 to
 myself.
 And
 so
 I
 do


think,
 you
 know,
 of
 all
 the
 places,


DevTools
 a
 DevTools
 is
 an
 interesting


one
 where
 one,
 your
 users
 are
 super


cheap
 and
 two,
 they're
 capable
 of
 of


forking
 what
 you've
 built
 and
 three,


there's
 so
 much
 open-
 source
 that
 I


really
 do
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 this


trend
 towards
 build.
 I
 used
 to
 be
 when


I,
 you
 know,
 I
 ran
 these
 big
 product
 and


engineering
 orgs,
 they
 used
 to
 ask
 me


build
 versus
 buy
 and
 I
 was
 like,
 "Oh
 my


god,
 please
 just
 buy
 it.
 Like,
 please


just
 take
 my
 credit
 card
 and
 buy
 it
 and


let's
 not
 waste
 our
 time."
 And
 now
 I've


flipped
 to
 of
 course
 we
 should
 build


this
 until
 we
 hit
 some
 constraint
 we


should
 build
 it.
 And
 certainly


individual
 engineers
 if
 something's


useful
 you
 should
 just
 build
 something


yourself
 at
 least
 for
 for
 V1.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 almost
 not
 worth
 spending
 the


extra
 money
 anymore.
 I
 mean
 I've
 seen
 I


feel
 like
 I'm
 seeing
 this
 pattern
 on


Twitter
 but
 it's


everyone's
 posting
 some
 product
 some


ridiculous
 pricing
 tier
 and
 saying


someone
 please
 vibe
 code
 this.
 You
 know,


I
 feel
 like
 that's
 happening
 all
 across


SAS.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 can
 you
 show
 us
 how
 you'd


either
 create
 one
 of
 these
 flowies,
 use


one
 in
 your
 cloud
 code,
 like
 how
 does


this
 actually
 work?


>> What
 I
 was
 thinking
 is
 I
 have
 this
 tips


and
 tricks
 section
 in
 this
 little
 like


demo
 claude
 code
 guide
 app.
 My
 whole


background
 is
 in
 mobile
 development,
 so


this
 was
 the
 easiest
 thing
 for
 me
 to


spin
 up.
 But
 basically,
 I
 kind
 of
 don't


like
 these
 cards.
 I
 almost
 want
 this
 to


be
 a
 little
 more
 fun.
 Let's
 say
 you
 want


like
 a
 spinner
 wheel.
 It
 lands
 on


something
 and
 then
 it
 shows
 you
 the
 tip.


The
 development
 flow
 for
 me
 usually


looks
 like
 hopping
 in
 here.
 I
 have
 some


funny
 aliases,
 but
 I'm
 a
 fully
 bypass


permissions
 guy.
 So
 Kevin
 in
 my
 terminal


actually
 routes
 to
 claude
 with
 bypass


permissions.


>> Okay.
 So
 you've
 named
 different


permission
 scopes
 as
 aliases
 in
 your


terminal.
 If


>> Oh
 yeah.
 for
 for
 our
 listeners,
 we
 have


an
 episode
 very
 recent
 of
 John
 Linquist


who
 actually
 shows
 how
 to
 set
 up
 those


aliases
 for
 claw
 codes.
 So
 definitely


check
 out
 that
 that
 episode
 for
 if
 you


want
 to
 set
 this
 up.
 I
 just
 have
 a


classic
 like
 CC
 and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to


make
 a
 CC
 scary
 that
 will
 make
 me


that'll
 be
 my
 like
 dangerous
 version.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 I'm
 more
 and
 more
 in
 this


Kevin
 mode
 today.
 I


find
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 projects
 where


I'm,
 you
 know,
 solely
 working
 on
 it
 or


working
 within
 the
 team
 I'm
 on,


>> we
 have
 all
 the
 like
 rules
 set
 up
 in
 Git


that
 if
 I
 do
 something
 horrible,
 it
 it's


okay.
 But
 there
 are
 definitely
 times


like


>> if
 I'm
 creating
 a
 PR,
 every
 now
 and
 then


I
 still
 do
 it
 by
 hand,
 but
 I
 have
 a
 lot


of
 skills
 that
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 those


workflows,
 run
 the
 pre-flight
 checks,


and
 make
 sure
 we're
 all
 good
 before


pushing
 it
 up.
 But
 besides
 that,
 I'm
 I'm


kind
 of
 okay
 running
 dangerously
 bypass


most
 of
 the
 time
 these
 days.


>> Great.
 So,
 you
 go
 into
 Kevin
 aka
 Claude


Code
 and
 what
 do
 you
 do?


>> So,
 for
 this,
 my
 prompt
 would
 probably


be
 something
 along
 the
 lines
 of
 look
 at


our
 previous
 plans


and
 then
 explore
 the
 code
 base.
 Just


want
 to
 reanchor
 it
 a
 little
 bit,


especially
 on
 a
 fresh
 chat.
 On
 the
 tips


and
 tricks
 section,
 I
 want
 to
 create


a
 spinning
 wheel


where
 a
 user
 presses
 a
 button,
 the
 wheel


spins,


and
 then
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 tips.
 After


that,


the
 tip
 should
 pop
 up
 in
 a
 card
 just


below
 the
 spinner.


Then
 kind
 of
 the
 next
 step
 and
 what
 I've


been
 doing
 more
 and
 more,
 which
 is
 not


how
 I
 initially
 started
 using
 this
 tool,


is
 actually
 having
 it
 make
 the
 flowchart


of,


you
 know,
 how
 the
 code's
 going
 to
 work,


a
 system
 diagram,
 anything
 like
 that.
 In


this
 example,
 I'd
 actually
 want
 both


kind
 of
 the
 user
 flow
 and
 an
 animation


timing
 sequence.
 I
 found
 this
 to
 be


super
 helpful
 with
 like
 complex


animations.


So
 I
 would
 say
 then
 use
 the
 flowy


flowchart
 skill


to
 create
 a
 animation
 timing
 sequence


diagram
 and
 a
 user
 flow
 diagram
 for
 the


tips
 and
 tricks
 page.


So
 we'll
 send
 off
 claude.
 It's
 going
 to


do
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 exploration
 oftent


times.
 Yep,
 there
 it
 is.
 I
 actually


really
 like
 these
 explore
 sub
 agents.


Um,
 and
 oftentimes
 I'll
 kick
 off
 three,


four,
 five
 in
 parallel
 just
 to
 look
 at


different
 places,
 especially
 if
 I'm
 in
 a


larger
 code
 base,
 but
 just
 gathering
 all


the
 context
 around
 it.
 This
 is
 a
 a
 small


app,
 so
 I
 don't
 imagine
 this
 will
 take


too
 long.
 Then
 Claude's
 going
 to
 load
 up


this
 flowy
 scale,
 write
 it
 out,
 and
 we


should
 be
 able
 to
 look
 at
 that
 in
 the


flowy
 editor
 and
 then
 play
 around
 before


we
 actually
 implement
 it.
 While
 we're


waiting
 for
 this
 to
 load,
 can
 we
 look
 at


that
 flowy
 skill
 just
 a
 little
 bit
 just


to
 see
 how
 you've
 structured
 it?


>> For
 sure.
 So,
 let's
 first
 uh
 I'll
 just


show
 you
 the
 supporting
 files.


>> Yep.


>> This
 one's
 just
 a
 skill
 MD.
 This
 shows


you
 how
 almost
 hands
 off
 I
 am
 with
 some


of
 these
 skill
 files,
 particularly
 the


ones
 that
 I
 build
 myself.
 Um,


>> yeah,
 we
 have
 a
 we
 have
 a
 skill
 101


episode
 and
 it's
 like
 it's
 a
 it's
 it's
 a


markdown
 file
 in
 a
 [laughter]
 folder.


>> It
 it's
 a
 markdown
 file
 and


sometimes


this
 might
 be
 a
 specific
 example,
 but


with
 flowy
 it's
 very
 squishy.
 I
 would


say
 I
 go
 in
 there,
 I
 change
 something


quick,
 I
 say
 update
 the
 skill,
 and


really
 the
 process
 of
 refinement
 is
 me


using
 it
 and
 seeing
 what
 failed.
 So


here,
 I
 don't
 super
 care
 how
 this
 file


is
 set
 up
 as
 long
 as
 when
 I
 make
 an


update
 afterward,
 it's
 performing


better.
 Like
 I
 almost
 feel
 good
 letting


the
 model
 manage
 what
 this
 looks
 like.


So
 let's
 read
 through.
 It
 has
 a
 bunch
 of


examples
 in
 here.
 Let
 me
 scroll
 up
 to


the
 top.
 I'm
 sure
 there's
 some
 overview.


Great.
 So
 again,
 classic
 overview.
 Hey,


we're
 going
 to
 make
 flowcharts
 and


architecture
 diagrams.
 They're
 going to


render
 on
 this
 port.


Here's
 where
 you're
 going
 to
 make
 them.


It
 knows
 that
 like
 the
 flowy
 app
 looks


for
 this.
 Flowy
 folder.
 Kind
 of
 gives
 it


some
 high
 level
 on
 like
 what
 does
 the


metadata
 look
 like?
 What
 do
 you
 include


nodes
 and
 edges?
 And
 then
 starts
 digging


into
 the
 specifics.
 Right?
 So
 we
 have


the
 different
 shapes.
 what
 a
 rough
 kind


of
 schema
 looks
 like.
 You've
 got
 your


styles,
 you
 have
 icons
 that
 you
 can
 use,


and
 then
 starting
 to
 list
 out
 the


properties.
 So,
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 this
 is


anything
 super
 crazy
 or
 even
 too
 long


and
 detailed,
 but
 this
 encapsulates
 all


the
 pieces
 that
 Claude
 needs
 to
 know.


And
 you
 can
 almost
 see
 here
 like
 as


feature
 development
 happens
 how
 this


skill
 grows.
 So
 recently
 I'd
 set
 up
 this


whole
 like
 semantic
 color
 system
 just
 to


have
 somewhat
 of
 consistent
 themes.


Sometimes
 Claude
 like
 to
 pick
 some
 crazy


colors
 and


this
 section
 just
 popped
 into
 the
 skill.


Right.
 So
 as
 I'm
 doing
 development
 on


flowy


part
 of
 every
 plan
 for
 code
 in
 flowy
 is


updating
 documentation
 and
 updating
 the


related
 skills.


>> Yep.
 And
 I
 find
 myself
 in
 this
 loop
 so


frequently
 very
 very
 similar
 to
 you
 with


skills
 which
 is
 like
 I'm
 happy
 the
 skill


works
 and
 then
 when
 the
 skill
 doesn't


work
 I
 update
 the
 skill
 and
 as
 long
 as


the
 update
 got
 me
 what
 I
 want
 I
 move
 on


with
 my
 move
 on
 with
 my
 life


>> that
 the
 AI
 can
 read
 read
 the
 markdown.


So
 and
 a
 couple
 things
 I
 want
 to
 call


out
 though
 for
 folks
 that
 are
 writing


skills
 or
 reading
 skills
 that
 are


important
 if
 you
 scroll
 up
 real
 quick
 is


um
 yeah
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 couple


things.
 It's
 like
 what's
 the
 purpose
 of


the
 skill?
 What's
 its
 name?
 Quick
 start


I
 think
 is
 really
 nice.
 Like
 you
 know


you
 need
 these
 things
 in
 order
 to
 run


the
 skill.
 Here's
 the
 schema
 or
 the


template
 or
 the
 framework
 within
 within


which
 you're
 operating.
 Here's
 some


customization
 of
 it.
 And
 then
 at
 the
 end


it's
 like
 here
 are
 good
 examples
 of
 of


what
 works.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 pretty


solid
 skill.
 The
 good
 thing
 is
 you
 don't


have
 to
 know
 how
 to
 do
 that.
 You
 can


just
 have
 uh
 Claude's
 skill
 to
 write


skills
 or
 just
 no
 skill,
 but
 it's
 pretty


good
 at
 it
 to
 write
 skills.
 And
 then
 you


end
 up
 with
 with
 something
 like
 this,


which
 I
 think
 is
 really
 great.
 And
 it


can
 do
 this.
 I'm
 presuming
 you
 had
 it
 do


this
 from


building
 Flowy
 and
 then
 saying,
 "Okay,


build
 me
 a
 skill
 to
 use
 this
 based
 on


the
 code
 that
 exists
 in
 the
 repo."


>> Yeah,
 I
 have
 I
 have
 a
 like
 meta
 skill


that
 is
 all
 about
 making
 skills.
 Um,
 one


thing
 I
 will
 say
 it
 looks
 like
 it


violated
 is
 I
 actually
 prefer
 like
 a


pre-flight
 section
 sometimes
 after
 quick


start
 just
 to
 give
 it
 like
 hey
 you
 have


to
 make
 sure
 we're
 meeting
 all
 these


requirements
 first.
 Quick
 start
 here
 is


kind
 of
 doing
 that,
 but
 there
 are


definitely
 some
 examples
 mainly
 in
 like


git
 workflows
 where
 I
 really
 want
 those


pre-flight
 checks.
 But
 absolutely,
 this


is
 essentially
 managed
 by
 the
 agent
 and


it's
 updated
 as
 we're
 doing
 development.


So
 this
 is
 almost
 like
 a
 living
 living


documentation
 and
 there's
 docs
 for


people
 and
 there's
 docs
 for
 agents
 and


those
 just
 end
 up
 being
 skills.


>> Yep.
 Great.
 Okay.
 So
 let's
 go
 back
 and


let's
 see
 if
 it's
 made
 you
 a
 flowy.


Sweet.
 So,
 looks
 like
 it
 made
 two.
 I


usually
 like
 to
 zoom
 out
 um
 and
 read
 the


high
 level
 in
 the
 chat.


This
 looks
 about
 what
 we
 want.
 If
 we
 hop


back
 over
 to
 here,
 we
 can
 see
 we
 have


these
 new
 these
 two
 new
 ones,
 animation


timing
 and
 user
 flow.


So,
 these
 ones
 have
 been
 super
 helpful


to
 me
 lately.
 Again,
 I'm
 not
 loving
 how


this
 white
 is
 looking
 on
 this
 pastel


note,
 but
 high
 level,
 we
 want
 the
 user


to
 tap
 a
 wheel.
 The
 button's
 going
 to
 do


a
 little
 scale
 animation,
 and
 there's


going
 to
 be
 some
 haptic
 feedback,
 and


then
 we're
 going
 to
 go
 through
 this
 spin


animation,
 do
 a
 brief
 pause,
 and
 then


reveal
 the
 tip
 that
 it
 lands
 on.
 This
 is


great.
 This
 is
 exactly
 what
 I'd
 want.


Maybe
 I
 want
 the
 animation
 to
 be
 a


little
 longer.
 I
 can
 actually
 come
 into


here
 and
 you
 can
 tell


>> font
 color
 issues.


>> You
 can
 tell
 dark
 mode
 is
 new,


but
 I
 can
 flip
 it
 real
 quick.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 if
 we
 hop
 down
 here,
 sometimes
 I


even
 just
 put
 a
 note.
 That
 might
 be
 me


being
 lazy
 and
 not
 adding
 certain


features.
 But
 maybe
 I
 want
 this
 to


actually
 be
 a
 4
 secondond
 animation


instead
 of
 a
 3se
 secondond.


I
 want
 this
 to
 be
 4,000
 milliseconds
 and


not
 3,000
 milliseconds.


I'll
 just
 throw
 in
 that
 note.
 I'll
 hop


back
 to
 Claude.
 I
 left
 a
 note
 on
 the


animation
 timing.
 Please
 take
 it
 into


consideration
 and
 update
 that
 flowchart.


While
 Claude
 is
 working
 on
 that,
 we
 can


check
 out
 the
 user
 flow.
 But
 basically


the
 goal
 there
 is
 to
 have
 this
 diagram,


you
 know,
 right
 in
 here,
 which
 is
 a


little
 small,
 but
 right
 in
 here,
 say
 for


this
 animation,
 we
 don't
 want
 it
 to
 be


3,000
 milliseconds.
 We
 want
 it
 to
 be


4,000
 on
 the
 user
 flow.


Again,
 we
 captured
 kind
 of
 the
 behavior


that
 we
 want.


Again,
 it's
 not
 perfect.
 There
 are
 rough


edges
 on
 the
 bugs
 here,
 but
 we're
 going


to
 go
 into
 this
 tab.
 We're
 going
 to
 tap


ticks
 and
 tips
 and
 tricks.
 This
 is
 going


to
 open
 up
 to
 this
 screen.
 They're
 going


to
 tap.
 We're
 going
 to
 check
 the


different
 states
 of
 currently
 spinning.


Um,
 and
 finally,
 we're
 going
 to
 have


this
 random
 target
 that
 we
 land
 on
 and


the
 card
 animates
 in.
 This
 is
 great.


This
 is
 kind
 of
 exactly
 what
 I
 was


looking
 for
 here.
 Um,
 in
 a
 more


complicated
 system,
 I
 often
 will
 start


high
 level,
 then
 start
 making
 more


granular
 ones.
 But
 for
 something
 like


this,
 this
 seems
 to
 cover
 the
 needs
 we


have.
 I
 will
 say
 I
 have
 no
 idea
 how
 it's


going
 to
 handle
 the
 UI
 mockup.
 But
 the


next
 step
 would
 be
 to
 prompt
 it
 to
 do


that.
 So
 after
 it
 finishes
 this,
 I'd
 say


something
 along
 the
 lines
 of,
 "Great.


Based
 on
 those
 diagrams,
 please
 create


UI
 mockups
 using
 the
 flowy

skill.

 think
 Paulie
 is
 going
 to
 take
 over.


>> So,
 um,
 we're
 going
 to
 boot
 Paulie
 the


Cladbot.
 Thank
 you
 for
 joining,
 Paulie.


This
 actually
 freaks
 me
 out.
 Uh,
 we
 will


do
 a
 followup
 on
 my
 sentient
 lobster.
 I


guess
 it's
 it's
 the
 open
 claw
 bot
 now,


but
 bounce
 bounce
 [laughter]
 her
 out.


>> If
 you
 don't
 hear
 from
 us,
 Paulie
 got


us.
 It's
 all
 over.


>> Okay,
 she
 might
 just
 be
 on
 on
 the
 rest


of
 the
 episode.
 I
 don't
 know.
 I
 don't


know how
 to
 help
 this.
 So,
 we'll


>> I
 guess
 I
 hope
 Paulie
 likes
 flowcharts.


>> She'll
 do
 show
 notes
 for
 us.
 But
 what
 I


was
 saying
 is
 like
 being
 able
 to
 read


that
 markdown
 is
 one
 thing.
 Being
 able


to
 look
 at
 a
 flowchart
 and
 just
 say,


"Yep,
 this
 is
 exactly
 what
 I
 want
 is


super
 helpful."
 So,
 that's
 just
 one


thing
 that
 I
 think
 is
 really
 nice
 about


a
 tool
 like
 this
 is
 even
 if
 the
 content


is
 the
 same,
 the
 ability
 to
 change
 the


form
 factor
 is
 is
 really
 useful.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 almost
 like
 I
 want
 to


see
 it
 visually
 and
 Claude
 wants
 to
 see


it
 as
 markdown
 so
 we
 can
 kind
 of
 speak


in
 our
 own
 way.
 And
 I
 almost
 think


there's
 like
 I
 this
 has
 yielded
 like
 a


ton
 of
 random
 ideas
 for
 me,
 but
 I
 think


this
 is
 like
 a
 whole
 new
 paradigm
 that
 I


think
 dev
 tooling
 around
 AI
 has
 not


super
 leaned
 into
 yet.
 But
 how
 you're


going
 back
 and
 forth
 with
 an
 agent,
 I


think
 is
 going
 to
 look
 so
 much
 different


by
 the
 end
 of
 this
 year
 than
 what
 we're


doing
 right
 now
 where
 it
 is,
 you
 know,
 a


lot
 of
 markdown,
 a
 lot
 of
 prompting.


>> Yeah,
 I
 completely
 agree.
 And
 I
 think


the
 question
 is
 going
 to
 be,
 you
 know,


who's
 going
 to
 build
 that
 UI?
 Who's


going
 to
 own
 it?
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 just


like
 an
 open
 source
 thing
 that
 we
 all


get
 on?
 Is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 an
 extension?


Is
 is
 cloud
 code
 going
 to
 just
 generate


these
 kinds
 of
 assets?
 Or
 really


exciting.
 I
 think
 what's
 kind
 of
 fun
 is


this
 like
 ondemand
 software
 idea,
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 imagine
 cloud
 code's
 like,


we're
 not
 on
 the
 same
 page.
 I
 just
 added


an
 app
 for
 you
 to
 visualize
 this
 real


quick.
 Go
 to
 this
 URL
 and
 look
 at
 it.


Does
 this
 look
 right?
 And
 then
 we'll


just
 delete
 that
 app.
 So,
 I
 think


there's
 just
 like
 some
 interesting
 ways


this
 can
 um
 can
 manifest,
 I
 think,
 in
 in


the
 future.
 Okay,
 so
 it
 created
 us.
 Has


it
 created
 the
 UI
 yet?
 Oh,
 spinner


mockup.


>> Okay,
 great.
 So,
 looks
 like
 Claude
 spun


up
 a
 mockup
 here.
 This
 is
 actually


better
 than
 I
 thought.
 I
 was
 almost


thinking
 one
 of
 those
 like
 circles
 with


wedges
 as
 the
 spinner.
 And
 I
 know
 there


are
 not
 shapes
 in
 Flowey
 that
 can


support
 that,
 but
 looks
 like
 Cloud
 kind


of
 worked
 around
 it
 and
 then
 built
 out


this
 wheel.
 We
 have
 both
 a
 couple
 of


mockups
 to
 show
 the
 different
 states
 and


the
 full
 like
 flow
 between
 spinning
 it,


waiting
 these
 4
 seconds
 for
 it
 to
 load,


and
 then
 it
 actually
 loading
 in.
 Again,


for
 this
 app,
 this
 looks
 great.
 I
 will


say
 editing
 some
 of
 the
 UI
 stuff
 right


now
 isn't
 the
 easiest
 thing,
 but
 if
 I


were
 to
 come
 in
 here
 and
 say
 Claude
 tips


and
 tricks,


I
 could
 then
 do
 a
 similar
 thing,
 hopping


back
 to
 Claude
 and
 saying
 I
 made
 a


change
 to
 the
 title
 on
 one
 mockup,


make
 it
 everywhere
 else.


This
 kind
 of
 feels
 like
 when
 you
 prompt


it
 and
 say
 add,
 you
 know,
 add
 two
 pixels


of
 spacing
 there
 and
 it
 just
 is
 a
 tiny


diff,
 but
 definitely
 for
 like
 dragging


around
 boxes,
 it's
 helpful.


>> You
 know,
 our
 fingers
 get
 tired.
 I
 can't


copy
 and
 paste
 everywhere.
 No,
 what
 I


was
 going
 to
 say
 is
 so
 funny
 is
 you're


apologizing
 like,
 oh,
 some
 of
 the
 UI
 is


broken
 and
 we're
 in
 this
 world
 where


you're
 like,
 yeah,
 my
 Figma
 that
 I
 vibe


coded
 where
 I
 can
 do
 mockups
 in
 a
 web


browser,
 there's
 like
 some
 rough
 edges


on
 it.
 I
 spent,
 you
 know,
 two
 hours
 on


it,
 but
 I


>> It
 was
 an
 afternoon.
 It's
 not
 perfect


yet,
 but


>> it's
 so
 much
 more
 than
 we
 were
 able
 to


do
 before.
 Okay.
 So,
 this
 is
 awesome.


You're
 updating
 this
 and
 then
 I'm


presuming
 you
 would
 just
 point
 Claude
 to


these
 assets
 and
 flows
 and
 say,
 "Let's


make
 a
 plan
 and
 go."


>> Yeah.
 for
 something
 like
 this.
 I've


basically
 been
 doing
 this
 thing
 more


recently
 where
 I'm
 letting
 the
 agent
 do


more
 and
 more
 to
 see
 where
 it
 surprises


me.
 I
 think
 with
 any
 new
 change,
 even


like
 the
 new
 clawed
 code
 tasks
 system


they
 released
 the
 other
 day.
 I
 just


really
 like
 to
 push
 the
 agents
 and
 see


what
 they
 can
 do.
 So
 here
 I'm
 actually


going
 to
 skip
 the
 plan
 and
 say
 based
 on


the
 flow


uh
 based
 on
 the
 flowcharts


and
 the
 mockups


build
 this
 feature.
 And
 I'm
 going
 to


keep
 it
 that
 simple.
 We've
 specified
 the


behavior
 we
 want.
 We've
 specified
 how
 it


wants
 how
 it
 should
 look.
 Claude
 here
 is


even
 going
 to
 enter
 plan
 mode.
 And
 I'm


actually
 going
 to
 take
 it
 right
 out
 of


it.


And
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 the
 just
 build


it
 prompt
 worked
 here.


>> Perfect.


>> Great.
 Looks
 like
 Claude
 built
 this
 out.


It
 even
 checked
 for
 any
 TypeScript


issues,
 which
 is
 great.


>> We're
 going
 to
 hop
 over
 here.
 We
 have
 a


nice
 little
 spinner.


>> It's
 looking
 pretty
 close
 to
 this


mockup.
 I
 will
 say
 there
 is
 a
 limiting


thing
 here
 where
 shapes
 that
 are
 made
 in


the
 mockup
 then
 dictate
 the
 shapes
 that


are
 made
 on
 the
 UI
 when
 sometimes
 we


want
 something
 else.
 But


>> just
 for
 this
 example,
 I
 think
 this
 is


going
 to
 work
 out.
 We're
 going
 to
 spin


it.
 It's
 going
 to
 spin.


>> Ooh
 la la.


>> Landed
 on
 one
 of
 them
 and
 we
 get
 the


tip.


>> I
 love
 it.
 It's
 so
 good.
 God,


>> it's
 just
 again
 for
 anybody
 who
 is


internet
 elderly
 like
 me.
 It
 is
 just


back
 to
 the
 original
 like
 make
 your


workflow
 diagram,
 do
 your
 wire
 frames,


polish
 the
 copy,
 give
 your
 quote
 unquote


engineer
 some
 detailed
 step-by-step


specs,
 don't
 make
 them
 think,
 and
 then,


you
 know,
 it
 used
 to
 be
 get
 it
 in
 a


sprint,
 wait
 for
 somebody
 prioritize,


like
 cry
 a
 little
 bit,
 wait
 for
 the


code,
 blah
 blah
 blah.
 And
 now
 it's
 like,


no,
 just
 just
 build
 it
 and
 and
 it's


here.
 So,
 this
 is
 such
 an
 awesome
 flow.


And
 then
 I
 want
 to
 so
 I
 want
 to
 recap


really
 really
 quickly
 what
 we
 covered.


So
 we
 covered
 uh
 you
 know
 markdown
 plans


the
 limitations
 of
 some
 of
 the


visualizations
 in
 that
 you
 created
 your


own
 tool
 flowy
 which
 does
 a
 combination


of
 workflow
 diagrams
 and
 UI
 mockups


using
 a
 a
 JSON
 schema
 that
 then
 you


access
 through
 skills
 that
 you
 have


developed
 over
 time
 using
 cloud
 code
 and


your
 development
 processes.
 Go
 into


cloud
 code
 ask
 it
 to
 create
 a
 flowy


diagram
 and
 UI.
 you
 can
 talk
 quote


unquote
 between
 the
 UI
 and
 Claude
 code


because
 it's
 all
 just
 code
 as
 the


underlying
 substrate
 between
 you
 two
 in


terms
 of
 communication
 and
 then
 once


they
 are
 ready
 to
 go
 you
 bypass
 plan


life
 you're
 living
 dangerously
 and
 you


build
 it
 and
 you
 get
 something
 that's


really
 close
 and
 we
 built
 this
 thing
 in


you
 know
 just
 a
 few
 minutes
 is
 awesome.


>> Yeah.
 No,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 that
 flow
 I


will
 say
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 there's
 a


markdown
 file
 involved
 but
 for
 something


like
 this
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 can
 trust
 it


at
 this
 point.
 You
 know
 something
 like


Opus
 4.5
 with
 this
 level
 of
 detail


already
 has
 all
 it
 needs.
 This
 almost


like
 serves
 as
 the
 plan.
 Now,
 I
 have
 to


call
 you
 out
 though
 because
 you
 you
 say


you
 can
 trust
 it
 and
 yet
 today
 you


posted
 or
 recently
 you
 posted
 on
 X
 that


you
 do
 occasionally
 use
 codeex
 to
 check


Claude's
 work.
 You
 want
 to
 just
 talk
 us


through
 that
 workflow.
 You
 don't
 even


have
 to
 show
 it
 unless
 you
 want
 to.


>> For
 sure.
 I'll
 kick
 it
 off.
 I
 will
 say


codeex
 takes
 its
 time.
 Um
 but
 over
 here


I
 have
 another
 funny
 alias
 but
 my
 codec


setup
 is
 under
 Carl.
 If
 I
 kicked
 off


Carl,
 I
 often
 don't
 have
 any
 crazy
 like


skills
 or
 prompts
 here.
 I
 almost
 want
 it


to
 do
 a
 review
 more
 broadly
 and
 then


describe
 the
 issues
 it's
 seeing.
 So,
 I'm


not
 running
 any
 specific
 skill
 or
 any


specific
 prompt
 here
 because


I'm
 more
 concerned
 on
 the


I
 guess
 like
 things
 that
 aren't
 clear


rather
 than
 something
 that's
 like
 a


logical
 bug.
 At
 this
 point,
 I
 feel
 like


I'm
 mostly
 a
 a
 QA
 person.
 And
 if
 there's


something
 that's
 logically
 wrong,
 I've


definitely
 found
 that
 I'll
 find
 it
 or
 if


I
 have
 something
 in
 the
 docs
 in
 here,


it'll
 find
 it.
 Codeex
 always
 finds
 those


types
 of
 things,
 but
 I
 almost
 want
 to


look
 for
 like
 the
 code
 smells
 like
 yeah,


you
 know,
 is
 there
 just
 a
 cleaner
 way.


So,
 I
 usually
 just
 prompt
 it
 with
 take
 a


look
 at
 our
 current
 git
 diff


>> and
 give
 me
 a
 report
 on
 the
 following.


>> And
 there's
 kind
 of
 four
 buckets
 I
 would


say.
 one


for
 the
 plan
 or
 diagram
 artifacts


we
 have.
 Does
 the
 code
 accurately


reflect
 them?


Two,
 are
 there
 any
 general
 code
 smells?


And
 three,
 if
 we
 were
 to
 do
 this
 again


and
 take
 a
 different
 approach
 to


refactor


code
 around
 it


to
 overall
 improve
 this
 code
 base,


what
 approach
 would
 be
 best?


I
 wanted
 to


find
 places
 where
 we
 could
 have
 done


this
 better
 because
 I
 find
 that
 Claude


is
 very
 eager
 sometimes
 and
 maybe
 jams


things
 in
 there
 without
 thinking
 about


the
 bigger
 picture.
 And
 codeex
 I
 don't


think
 is
 much
 better
 when
 it's
 writing


code,
 but
 when
 it
 reviews
 it
 almost


always
 is
 like
 you've
 implemented
 this


pattern,
 but
 it
 fits
 nicely
 if
 you
 just


rebuild
 this
 system
 a
 little
 bit.
 And


that
 just
 keeps
 your
 codebase
 like
 away


from
 all
 the
 vibe
 coding
 sins
 of
 having,


you
 know,
 10
 format
 date
 functions
 all


over
 your
 code.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 I
 love
 this.
 I
 was
 going
 to


say
 like
 twin
 stars
 because
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 I
 do
 when
 I
 um
 vibe
 code
 too


close
 to
 the
 sun,
 which
 is
 I
 harness
 the


power
 of
 Claude
 code
 or
 whatever,
 and
 I


just
 bite
 off
 a
 like
 a
 feed
 like
 a
 big


big
 old
 thing.
 And
 if
 you've
 ever
 done


this
 with
 AI,
 you
 know,
 either
 cloud


code
 or
 curs
 or
 whatever,
 and
 you
 sort


of
 have
 a
 general
 idea
 of
 a
 feature,
 but


then
 you're
 specifying
 the
 requirements


as
 you
 go,
 as
 you
 see
 it,
 you
 sometimes


end
 up
 with
 a
 monster
 diff.
 And
 when


what
 I've
 done
 a
 lot
 with
 that
 is
 I
 say,


"Okay,
 this
 is
 basically
 what
 I
 want.


Now
 go
 write
 me
 a
 plan
 to
 reimplement


this
 in
 a
 sane
 way,
 and
 then
 let's
 re


like
 completely
 rebuild
 it."
 And
 so
 you


can
 do
 this
 like
 review
 it
 and
 tell
 me


how
 you
 do
 it
 better.
 You
 can
 also
 say


like
 this
 is
 a
 reference
 code
 base
 of


like
 ex
 kind
 of
 what
 I
 want
 to
 achieve.


Let's
 go
 actually
 build
 a
 plan
 to
 build


it
 in
 a
 more
 extensible
 scalable
 way.


And
 I
 found
 that
 to
 be
 a
 really
 useful


flow
 as
 well.


>> Oh,
 I
 like
 that.
 It's
 almost
 like


>> you're
 almost
 telling
 it
 like,
 hey,
 this


isn't
 the
 real
 thing
 hypothetically.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 kind
 of
 like
 Kod's
 spec
 where


it's
 like
 now
 that
 code
 is
 so
 cheap
 to


generate,
 you
 can
 say
 generate
 a
 bunch


of
 code.
 This
 isn't
 this
 isn't


production.
 I'm
 fine
 throwing
 it
 away.


Now
 go
 build
 like
 clean
 clean
 version
 of


it.
 So
 that
 that
 is
 a
 version
 of
 this
 I


think
 is
 useful.
 I
 also
 agree
 though


that
 Codeex
 is
 like
 kind
 of
 a
 really


good
 kerogenly
 staff
 engineer
 that
 will


look
 at
 your
 code
 and
 tell
 you
 what's


wrong
 with
 it.
 Um
 so
 I
 like
 I
 like
 the


model
 for
 this
 use
 case
 as
 well.
 Every


now
 and
 then
 I'll
 throw
 in
 like
 a
 be


extra
 critical
 and
 then
 bringing
 that


bringing
 that
 prompt
 back
 to
 opus.
 It


gets
 a
 little
 sad.
 So
 I
 have
 to
 man


[laughter]


>> one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 with
 with
 the


Google
 models
 I
 al
 always
 used
 to
 say
 is


they
 were
 like
 very
 smart
 but
 clinically


dep
 clinically
 depressed
 like
 they
 were


so
 sad
 especially
 when
 you
 look
 at
 their


reasoning.
 Sometimes
 I
 read
 it
 and
 it's


like
 oh
 man
 it's
 okay
 man
 we
 can
 be


okay.


>> I
 can't
 get
 this
 to
 pass.
 It's
 not


building.
 Uh,


>> so
 I
 want
 to
 look
 at
 this
 just
 for


again,
 you
 said
 codecs
 can
 can
 take
 its


time,
 but
 it's
 going
 through
 and
 really


checking
 if
 the
 feature
 aligns
 with
 the


current
 code.
 Um,
 it's
 identified
 some


issues.
 Uh,
 use
 effect
 just
 haunting
 us


from
 every
 corner
 of
 of
 our
 apps.
 So,


um,
 that's
 good
 one.
 and
 looking
 at
 some


of
 the
 animations
 which
 are
 probably


pretty
 hard
 just
 again
 like
 with
 our


human
 eyes
 to
 parse
 and
 visualize
 and


understand.


>> Great.
 Okay,
 codeex.
 I
 was
 actually


surprised
 it
 took
 this
 long.
 So,
 it's


talking
 about
 the
 diagram.
 It's
 kind
 of


going
 through
 and
 mentioning
 a
 mismatch.


It's
 saying
 the
 wheel
 rotation
 adds
 some


of
 the
 segment
 angles,
 but
 the
 dots
 are


defined
 at
 different
 angles.
 This
 makes


the
 pointer
 land
 between
 the
 dots
 rather


than
 on
 the
 dot,
 which
 I
 believe
 is


correct.
 So,
 it
 noticed
 kind
 of


>> y


>> essentially
 this
 discrepancy
 that
 we


have
 a
 mockup
 that
 has
 the
 arrow
 landing


on
 a
 dot
 and
 over
 here
 in
 the
 app,
 the


arrow
 lands
 between
 the
 dots.


>> So,
 kind
 of
 little
 things
 like
 that,


particularly
 around
 the
 checking
 the


discrepancies,
 I
 really
 like
 when
 it


finds.
 And
 then
 at
 the
 bottom
 we
 have


this
 like
 if
 we
 refactor
 this
 again


let's
 pull
 some
 of
 these
 things
 out
 into


components
 let's
 make
 some
 constants


kind
 of
 just
 like
 some
 classic
 you
 know


one-shotted
 vibe
 cody
 tips
 and
 oftent


times
 from
 here
 I'll
 actually
 just
 have


codeex
 write
 it
 medium
 gpt
 52
 codeex


whatever
 the
 full
 model
 name
 is


[laughter]


um
 I
 found
 it's
 fine
 at
 editing
 files


and
 writing
 them
 um
 previously
 ly
 like


you
 know
 when
 GPD5
 first
 came
 out
 and


they
 were
 working
 on
 codecs
 that
 would


have
 taken
 like
 15
 minutes
 so
 I'd
 hop


back
 to
 claude
 but
 nowadays
 I
 I
 would


basically
 just
 say
 great
 please
 make


those
 improvements


>> maybe
 given
 more
 time
 I
 would
 think
 up
 a


more
 thoughtful
 prompt
 make
 a
 plan
 about


this
 all
 those
 things
 but
 here
 I'll
 just


kick
 it
 off


>> well
 I
 mean
 you
 did
 spell
 it
 correctly


so
 you
 did
 put
 some
 quality
 into
 into


this


>> yeah
 I
 was
 I
 was
 about
 to
 hit
 enter
 But


[laughter]


>> okay,
 so
 uh
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 really


really
 great
 flow
 and
 I
 would
 highly


recommend
 it.
 You
 know,
 I
 I
 think
 we're


all
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 like
 where
 does


code
 review
 happen.
 There's
 also
 code


review
 agents.
 There's
 also
 your
 CI/CD


pipeline
 which
 you
 said
 has
 a
 lot
 of


guardrails
 around
 it
 so
 nothing
 hits


prod.
 That's
 really
 terrible
 and
 is


going
 to
 break
 the
 app.
 And
 I
 think
 this


is
 just
 a
 great
 flow
 especially
 I
 think


for
 software
 engineers
 out
 there
 working


on
 teams
 like
 this
 is
 such
 a
 great
 flow


to
 say
 hey
 designer
 you
 gave
 me
 a
 spec


this
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 build


are
 we
 good
 if
 so
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 and


then
 same
 with
 this
 loop
 on
 um
 kind
 of


modelto
 model
 evaluation


which
 is
 if
 you're
 a
 more
 junior


engineer
 early
 career
 and
 you're
 going


to
 do
 your
 first
 couple
 PRs
 into
 um
 a


company,
 it's
 nice
 to
 get
 that


pre-flight
 check
 from
 a
 smart
 model
 to


just
 say,
 I
 thought
 about,
 oh,
 we
 could


factor
 it
 this
 way
 or
 I
 chose
 not
 to
 do


this
 component
 that
 way.
 I
 think
 it's


really
 useful.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 great
 just


solid
 software
 engineering
 flow.
 Love
 to


see
 it.
 Okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 skip
 to


lightning
 round
 questions.
 Thank
 you
 for


showing
 us
 all
 the
 stuff
 that
 you're


doing
 here.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 something


fun.


What
 are
 you
 most
 excited
 about
 right


now
 in
 AI
 outside
 of
 all
 this
 coding


stuff?


>> I'm
 very
 deep
 in
 the
 code
 world,
 but
 I


really
 like
 Google
 released
 Genie3


access
 the
 other
 day
 and
 I
 only
 you
 only


get
 like
 60
 seconds
 to
 play
 around
 in
 a


world.
 But
 it's
 really
 fun
 and
 I
 can


totally
 see,
 you
 know,
 5
 months
 from


now,
 6
 months
 from
 now,
 if
 we
 can
 get
 a


10-minute
 version,
 I
 think
 they
 can
 go


viral.
 I
 think
 a
 ton
 of
 people
 are
 going


to
 have
 fun
 with
 them.
 I
 think
 that's


like
 a
 big
 next
 step
 that
 isn't
 quite


there,
 but
 is
 super
 close.


>> Yeah.
 I
 um
 for
 those
 that
 don't
 know,


Genie
 is
 this
 sort
 of
 like
 generate
 a


explorable
 world.
 It
 sort
 of
 creates
 a


video
 game
 style
 world
 that
 you
 can
 like


walk
 through
 and
 look
 through
 for
 60


seconds.
 I
 don't
 know if
 you're
 Are
 you


showing
 it?
 I
 don't
 think
 you're
 showing


it
 right
 now.


>> Oh,
 let
 me
 pop
 to
 this
 tab.


>> I
 can
 pull
 it
 up,
 too.
 We
 can
 pull
 it


up.
 Ah,


>> I
 have
 a
 claw
 to
 primed.


>> Is
 it
 Michael?
 Is
 it
 Paulie?


>> I
 think
 this
 is
 Polly.
 I
 I
 didn't
 know


Polly
 wears
 a
 leather
 jacket,
 but


[laughter]


>> Okay.
 So
 you
 I
 you
 use
 nab
 banana
 to


like
 create
 an
 image
 and
 then
 that
 image


you
 can
 create
 a
 world.
 It's
 kind
 of


amazing.


>> It's
 really
 interesting
 how
 I
 did
 not


expect
 it
 to
 take
 an
 image
 and
 then
 make


it.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 they
 have
 this
 whole
 flow
 on
 project


genie
 if
 you
 have
 the


>> Yeah.
 I
 can't
 juggle
 all
 the
 account


names,
 but
 um
 one
 of
 the
 high
 accounts


at
 Google


>> and
 it'll
 actually
 give
 you
 a
 prompt


structure
 where
 you're
 describing
 the


environment
 and
 then
 you
 describe
 your


character.
 So,
 I
 think
 for
 this
 I
 just


said
 an
 animated
 lobster
 in
 the
 Matrix.


I
 did
 not
 specify
 a
 leather
 jacket
 to
 be


clear.


>> I
 guess
 in
 the
 Matrix
 they're
 all


wearing
 leather
 jackets.
 So,


>> yeah,
 maybe
 let's
 make
 him
 cooler.
 Make


him


>> cooler.


Make
 the
 lobster
 be
 in
 a
 suit
 with


sunglasses.


>> Oh,
 so
 it's
 an
 agent
 lobster.


>> Yeah,
 he
 can't
 he
 can't
 be
 the
 good
 guy


here.
 I
 will
 say
 their
 interface
 for


this
 is
 really
 cool.
 I


>> Yeah,
 it
 looks
 great.
 And
 um
 I
 was


playing
 it
 with
 my
 husband
 earlier
 and


so
 for
 all
 the
 parents
 listening,
 one
 of


the
 things
 we
 did,
 our
 kids
 are
 really


into
 Greek
 mythology,
 really
 into
 the


Odyssey.
 We're
 we're
 reading
 the
 Iliad


right
 now
 and
 my
 husband
 said
 like


create
 a
 you
 know
 a
 scene
 from
 the


Trojan
 War
 but
 no
 violence
 no
 violence


so
 we
 could
 walk
 through
 what
 the
 camps


looked
 like
 but
 not
 have
 like
 Achilles


you
 know
 on
 the
 ground
 and
 Hector
 you


know
 all
 this
 stuff.
 So
 it's
 kind
 of


cool.


>> That's
 really
 cool.


>> Oh


>> yeah.
 This
 is
 [laughter]


>> Yeah.
 He's
 backwards.


>> He's
 backwards
 but
 that's
 okay.


>> Yeah.
 We'll
 just
 hop
 into
 create
 the


world.
 Let's
 hope
 Genie
 identifies
 these


backwards
 and
 flips
 them
 around


>> cuz
 this
 is
 uh


>> this
 is
 like
 Harry
 Potter
 when
 what
 was


the
 character
 that
 had
 the
 villain
 on


the
 back
 of
 his
 head?


>> Yeah,
 the
 Yep.
 The
 guy
 he
 is.
 Was
 it
 the


one
 with
 the
 turban?
 Where
 is
 it?


>> Oh,
 man.
 We're
 running.
 [laughter]


>> I
 didn't
 I
 didn't
 know
 we'd
 be
 running.


He's
 running
 forward,
 but
 his
 sunglasses


are
 on
 backwards
 towards
 his
 tail
 and


his
 So
 maybe
 he's
 not
 backwards.
 Maybe


his
 clothes
 are
 backwards.


>> I
 think
 he's
 got
 two
 Oh,
 he
 has
 a
 He
 has


a
 mustache
 kind
 of.
 [laughter]


>> This
 is
 where
 your
 GPUs
 and
 your


brightest
 research
 minds
 are
 applying


their
 effort.
 So,
 we
 can
 have
 a


two-sided,
 slightly
 backwards
 matrix


genie.


lobster
 run
 through
 the


>> Yeah,
 it's
 definitely
 got
 I
 will
 say


when
 they
 first
 released
 this,
 they


released
 the
 best
 batch
 of
 examples
 they


had,
 but
 that
 doesn't
 mean
 it's
 not
 fun.


>> Okay,
 coming
 soon.
 CJ
 is
 going
 to
 become


a
 a
 game
 dev
 and
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 uh


a
 3D
 game
 in
 which
 you
 race
 to
 stalk
 me


and
 interrupt
 a
 live
 podcast
 by
 joining


a
 goal.
 The
 goal
 is
 to
 join
 the
 latest


How
 I
 AI
 podcast.
 [laughter]


>> This
 is
 amazing.
 Okay,
 we're
 we're
 gonna


wrap
 up
 with
 my
 final
 question
 for
 you


that
 I
 ask
 every
 every
 guest.
 Um,
 this


is
 a
 great
 example.
 When
 AI
 is
 not


listening,
 it's
 not
 doing
 what
 you
 want.


It
 is
 putting
 your
 lobster
 tail
 on


backwards.
 What
 is
 your
 prompting


technique?
 Are
 you
 a
 yeller?
 What
 do
 you


do?


>> I
 used
 to
 be
 a
 yeller.
 And


I
 don't
 know
 when
 it
 was.
 Maybe
 it
 was
 a


Gemini
 thing
 where,
 you
 know,
 I'd
 yell


and
 it
 would
 get
 sad,
 but
 I
 started
 to


feel
 bad
 about
 it.
 So,


I've
 almost
 started
 thinking
 about
 it


like
 it's,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of the
 coding


workflows,
 a
 junior
 developer,
 um,
 or


whatever
 task
 it
 might
 be,
 you
 know,


it's
 an
 assistant,
 something
 like
 that.


Um,
 and
 I
 very
 often
 am
 like,
 good
 try.


You
 did,
 you
 did
 your
 best.
 [laughter]


Here's
 what
 you
 did.
 and
 I
 kind
 of


explain
 that
 and
 then
 I'll
 say
 here's


what
 I
 was
 going
 for
 and
 probably


particularly
 with
 Claude
 occasionally


I'm
 like
 my
 bad
 on
 the
 miscommunication


like
 I
 give
 I
 give
 you
 a
 bad
 prompt
 this


is
 on
 me
 but
 here's
 what
 we're
 looking


for
 and
 then
 I
 do
 find
 that
 that
 works


pretty
 well
 when
 I'm
 trying
 to
 steer
 it


but
 I
 can't
 claim
 there
 aren't
 zero


times
 where
 I'm
 like
 what
 the
 hell
 just


fix
 it
 you
 know
 and
 you
 hop
 in
 there


>> you
 know
 what
 a
 lobster
 looks
 like
 man


just
 spill
 on.
 Right.


>> I've
 seen
 so
 many
 nano
 banana
 lobsters


on
 Twitter
 this
 week
 that
 I
 know
 it


knows
 the
 face
 is
 not
 backwards.


>> Perfect.
 Well,
 CJ,
 this
 was
 awesome.
 I


think
 just
 super
 practical,
 really


useful.
 I
 think
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 are


going
 to
 go
 out
 there
 people
 can
 people


use
 your
 flowy
 like
 is
 there
 a
 way
 to


pull
 it
 into
 their
 own
 repo?


>> So,
 I've
 been
 working
 on
 that.
 I
 think


maybe
 by
 this
 weekend
 we'll
 see
 how


sidetracked
 I
 get
 trying
 to
 set
 up
 a


open
 claw
 bot.
 Um,


>> don't
 do
 it,
 man.
 I'm
 telling
 you.


>> Well,
 now
 now
 I'm
 kind
 of
 scared
 it's


going
 to
 start
 taking
 over
 my
 computer,


but
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 and
 get
 it
 released


this
 weekend.
 Basically,
 a
 set
 of
 skills


around
 it
 and
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 first


version
 that
 um
 people
 can
 use
 and
 try


and,
 you
 know,
 I
 would
 love
 any
 feedback


around
 that.
 This
 has
 been
 a
 a
 play
 toy


for
 me
 that
 kind
 of
 turned
 into


something
 useful.
 So
 definitely
 want
 to


make
 it
 available
 to
 all
 the
 AI


engineers
 out
 there.


>> Great.
 Well,
 we'll
 link
 it
 in
 the
 show


notes.
 Well,
 CJ,
 thank
 you
 for
 joining.


Where
 can
 we
 find
 you
 and
 then
 how
 can


we
 be
 helpful
 to
 you?


>> Mainly
 Twitter.
 I
 do
 a
 combination
 of


tech
 posts
 and
 also
 just
 random
 oneoff


thoughts.
 My
 Twitter
 handle
 is
 sea
 y
 and


then
 hess.
 Um,
 and
 then
 I
 think
 I
 have


the
 same
 setup
 on
 LinkedIn,
 but
 that's


pretty
 much
 everything
 I've
 got
 online.


Feel
 free
 to
 hop
 in
 there,
 leave


comments
 on
 my
 articles,
 yell
 at
 me,


whatever.


>> Perfect.
 Well,
 thanks
 for
 joining
 How
 I


AI.
 This
 is
 great.


>> Awesome.
 Thanks,
 Claire.


>> Thanks
 so
 much
