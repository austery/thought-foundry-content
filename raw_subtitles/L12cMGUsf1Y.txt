Climate finance finds itself
in a confused position today,
in 2025.
It is viewed as insufficient by many,
as a niche by mainstream finance
and as elusive by everyone else.
And yet, financing a clean growth economy
relies entirely on the real money.
Today, we are investing a little over
a trillion dollars every year, globally,
in the energy transition.
By our best estimates,
we need that number
to rise to 3.5 trillion
every year between now and 2050.
Why is there a gap?
As a financier and investor myself,
I've been at the heart
of how financial institutions
and institutional investors,
including sovereign wealth funds,
asset managers,
asset owners and banks,
think and act on the clean
energy transition.
And I believe there is one
major fault line
in global climate finance.
We have prioritized
perfection over progress
by painting entire swaths
of sectors, industries,
companies and countries
in purely binary terms of gray or green.
But as we all know,
there are 50 shades of green.
(Laughter)
And we need to work with them all
if we have to solve this challenge
at speed and scale.
And yes, that means that the money
must flow not just to clean solutions
but also, and specifically,
to heavy polluters and emerging markets.
And yes, we are not going
to solve the climate challenge
through purity tests.
The developed world committed
100 billion dollars
for the developing world
to facilitate the clean-energy
transition annually.
That goal was achieved 13 years later.
That time has broadly become symbolic,
in addition to that goal itself,
of our inability to finance the transition
at the speed and scale needed.
By contrast, governments
all over the world
allocated 10 trillion, with a T,
in COVID economic stimulus in two months.
Did we spend years or months
coming up with what COVID finance means?
Did we create standards,
working groups, taxonomies,
frameworks, definitions?
Yet somehow our lexicon of financing
the climate transition grows.
The dollars?
Not so much.
If we are to truly work on this,
we need integrity.
Absolutely.
But in our quest for perfection,
we are losing out on the goal itself.
On the goal of unleashing the largest
commercial opportunity of our time.
Financing green requires greening finance.
And guess what?
In many cases, it actually makes you money
whilst reducing emissions.
For instance, many utilities
around the world are realizing
that it is more expensive to run
coal plants than renewables
because of the rapidly
falling cost of renewables.
For investors, this is
an incredible opportunity.
By buying up some of those coal plants
and developing a strategy
for an accelerated phaseout,
investors have the opportunity
to not just generate an attractive return.
They can also reduce emissions
as well as reduce costs
for tax for ratepayers.
Why hasn't this happened?
The idea of working
with heavy-emitting
industries and polluters
is incredibly uncomfortable
for a lot of my climate activist friends,
as well as some of the most sophisticated
investors I've worked with,
who have spent decades
trying to understand
the impact of their emissions
on the planet's trajectory.
But not working with them is worse still.
Let me walk you through
a concrete example.
Although I'll talk about steel.
Imagine you are the CEO
of a steel company in India.
You have a decarbonization
strategy in place,
and you want to invest
to reduce the emissions
in your steel-making process
and reduce your reliance on coal
and increase your capacity for renewables.
You go out to the capital markets
to raise capital to fund that plan.
Great.
Everyone should love this, right?
Here's what you hear
on the investor roadshow.
"Ah,
I'd love to invest in you,
but my policy prohibits me
from having exposure to coal."
Or, "I'd rather not have the NGOs
demonstrating on my doorstep
if I start working with you."
Or, "I'd love to invest in you,
but I have a net-zero portfolio target,
and that will increase my emissions.”
So after a long and arduous
process of no's,
you go back home and wonder:
should you just scrap the plan,
or should you stick to it
and use your own balance sheet capital?
You stick it through,
and then you go to your shareholders
for approval to allocate the capex.
But your shareholders are not happy
because that affects their dividend.
Congratulations.
You've officially found yourself
in a transition trap.
You want to transition,
but your hands are tied.
So as investors and financiers,
this dynamic of potentially
starving companies of capital
is likely to put them back
into their status quo
or worse still,
put them into the hands of investors
who don't really care about the climate.
So how do we prioritize
progress over perfection?
By building trust.
Because trust,
and I say this as a financier,
trust and not capital is the key currency
for the energy transition.
We need to put trust back
on the climate finance term sheet.
And we can do that by mobilizing finance
with less strings attached.
As an example, in the recent past,
several countries,
including major economies,
have refused financing packages
on clean-energy transition
offered by several countries
in the Global North.
Because they're concerned
that they're being asked
to commit to goals
in exchange for capital
that may, at best, come in a trickle
or at worst, increase
national debt levels.
That erodes trust.
So if we are to truly crack global
climate finance partnerships
for the South,
we need to make it easier
and faster for entrepreneurs
and those countries
to access that capital.
We need to put that capital to work
to scale the clean-energy ecosystems
and systems in those countries,
but we also need to provide
the enabling infrastructure
in the interim period
to ensure a stable
and secure grid and supply.
We can all work together on this
because we know that if we expand
the investable universe
by expanding the scope
of what is included,
we can together ensure that finance
reaches every part of the global economy.
I often go back to how I thought,
with the frustration and the impatience
of my 12-year-old climate activist self,
demanding that we need
a clean-energy system now.
But with hindsight, and with my years
of experience thus far,
I know that we cannot get perfection
if we don't start acting.
I want us to think about what role
each of us can play.
And I want us to think
about how we can engage
with high-emitting industries
using finance as the language,
because that is the language
they understand and respond to.
So if you're a financier,
embrace the opportunity to work
with all sectors, industries,
companies, countries.
If you're an activist,
hold them accountable,
but not by ostracizing them.
And if you're neither,
then you still have the opportunity
to become the rare breed that is both.
I truly believe in the ability
of our generation
to use the power of markets
and rebuild the trust in climate finance,
to get it out of its confused position
and unleash the trillions that we need
to generate clean energy
and clean growth for everyone.
Thank you.
