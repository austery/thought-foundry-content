All
 right.
 Hello
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back


to
 the
 channel.
 I'm
 here
 today
 with
 a


very,
 very
 special
 guest,
 American


rapper,
 extraordinaire,
 24K
 Golden.


>> What's
 up,
 Chad?


Uh,
 I
 missed
 the
 market
 open,
 market


closed
 today
 because
 I
 was
 sick.
 I
 was


supposed
 to
 go
 to
 his
 concert
 last


night.
 Also
 missed
 that
 because
 I
 was


sick.
 But
 we're
 live.
 We're
 here
 and
 uh,


we
 got
 some
 stuff
 to
 talk
 about
 with
 Mr.


Golden,
 which
 is
 his
 actual
 name.
 How


you
 doing?


>> I'm
 good,
 man.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 this
 is
 going
 to
 be
 really
 fun.
 I've


been
 a
 fan
 of
 Golden
 for
 a
 long
 time.


Some
 of
 you
 guys
 might
 know
 him.
 Some
 of


you
 guys
 might
 not
 know
 him.
 Some
 of the


people
 that
 are
 older
 here
 probably


haven't
 heard
 his
 music.
 If
 you're
 more


millennial,
 Gen
 Z,
 early
 20s
 to
 sort
 of


mid30s,
 you
 probably
 know
 his
 music.
 Uh,


Mood
 is
 the
 song
 that
 kind
 of
 went
 crazy


viral.
 Two
 billion
 streams
 on
 Spotify.


And,
 uh,
 I
 hit
 him
 up
 one
 day.
 I
 saw
 you


follow
 me
 on
 Twitter
 and
 I
 was
 like,


"Bro,
 let's
 let's
 break
 down
 your


portfolio."
 And
 he
 was
 like, "Let's
 do


it."
 So,
 we're
 here.


>> We're
 here.
 This
 has
 been
 a
 long
 time


coming.
 Um,
 I've
 been
 a
 fan
 of
 you.
 I


was
 following
 you
 for
 like
 months
 and


months
 before
 you
 even
 hit
 me
 up.
 and
 uh


you
 definitely
 gave
 me
 a
 lot
 of
 games.


So,
 I'm
 glad
 we
 can
 come
 together
 and


discuss
 and
 our
 thoughts
 on
 investing
 in


music
 and
 all
 that
 [ __ ]


>> You
 know,
 the
 cool
 thing
 about
 this
 is


it's
 full
 circle
 for
 me
 cuz
 like
 I


wanted
 to
 be
 a
 rapper.


>> You
 want
 to
 be
 a
 rapper?


>> I
 really
 wanted
 to
 be
 a
 rapper,
 bro.
 I


wanted
 to
 be
 a
 musician.
 Michael
 Jackson


died
 in
 2009.
 That's
 when
 I
 learned


about
 like
 the
 art
 of
 performing
 and


that's
 when
 I
 really
 fell
 in
 love
 with


music.
 Um
 I
 was
 big
 on
 Eminem
 and
 Lil


Wayne
 back
 in
 2008
 to
 2011.
 And
 then
 I


tried
 to
 rap.
 I
 tried
 to
 sing.
 I
 like


applied
 for
 some
 talent
 shows.
 I
 didn't


have
 any
 talent.
 So
 ended
 up
 becoming
 a


speaker.
 Went
 the
 debating
 route.
 And
 I


guess
 it's
 kind
 of
 helped
 with
 like
 live


streaming.
 But
 you
 got
 to
 do
 it.
 You
 got


to
 live
 the
 dream.
 So


>> yeah,


>> let's
 just
 start
 off
 with
 uh
 what
 has
 it


been
 like
 the
 past
 five
 years
 becoming


24K
 golden?


>> Well,
 I
 like
 to
 think
 that
 I
 was
 always


24K
 golden.
 I
 just
 had
 to
 like
 peel
 back


the
 layers
 of
 onions
 to
 to
 share
 it
 with


the
 world.
 So
 last
 five
 years,
 it
 was


what
 2020


that
 was
 when
 Mood
 came
 out.
 It
 was
 I


think
 July
 of
 2020
 and
 I
 was
 19
 at
 the


time
 and
 I
 had
 already
 had
 a
 couple
 big


songs
 before
 then
 like
 Valentino.
 Yeah.


Like
 what
 brother?


>> That's
 my
 boy
 Tanner.
 He's
 he's
 like
 one


of my
 good
 friends.
 So


>> So
 yeah,
 Valentino
 and
 City
 of
 Angels.


Those
 are
 like
 my
 first
 two
 big
 songs.


But
 when
 Moo
 dropped,
 it


>> blew
 everything
 crazy
 out
 of
 the
 water.


Like,


>> and
 um
 it's
 always
 funny.
 People
 ask
 me


like,
 "Did
 you
 know
 that
 was
 going
 to
 be


a
 hit
 song?"
 And
 I
 always
 tell
 them


like,
 "Honestly,
 no.
 I
 just
 knew
 it
 was


a
 song
 that
 I
 liked."


>> Yeah.


>> But
 yeah,
 that
 song
 changed
 my
 life
 in


so
 many
 different
 ways.


>> But
 so,
 so
 co
 is
 when
 it
 actually
 cuz


2019,
 I
 think
 it
 came
 out,
 right?
 No,


no, no.
 It
 came
 out
 in
 I
 made
 it
 like


within
 the
 first
 month
 of
 COVID.


>> Okay.


>> And
 like
 uh
 well,
 it
 was
 in
 April,
 so
 a


couple
 months
 into
 co
 and
 then
 we
 put
 it


out
 in
 the
 summer
 and
 then


>> it's
 very
 rare
 that
 like
 a
 song
 blows
 up


that
 fast.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Especially
 when
 you're
 not
 like
 a
 Drake


or
 a
 Taylor
 Swift
 or
 somebody.
 I
 had


some
 songs,
 but
 like
 I
 was
 still


relatively


>> new
 to
 this
 [ __ ]
 Yeah.


>> So,
 okay.
 So,
 so
 did
 you
 like
 were
 you


in
 the
 studio
 thinking
 it's
 lockdown?
 I


need
 something
 that
 like
 fits
 the
 vibe


of
 being
 stuck
 at
 home
 or
 it
 was
 kind
 of


just
 random.
 You
 were
 right.
 Like
 how


did


>> So
 I
 was
 So
 I
 did
 that
 song
 with
 Ian


Dior


>> and
 it
 wasn't
 we
 weren't
 even
 supposed


to
 make
 music
 like
 that
 day.
 Like
 we


were
 kicking
 it
 at
 his
 apartment.
 We


were
 playing
 uh


>> this
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area.


>> No,
 this
 was
 in
 LA.
 I've
 been
 in
 LA


already
 at
 that
 point.


>> But
 we
 were
 playing
 Call
 of
 Duty
 uh
 gun


game
 2v2.
 No,
 Gunfight
 2v2.
 And
 um
 the


homie
 Omare
 was
 there.
 He's
 a
 producer.


And
 KBZ
 was
 there.
 He's
 a
 producer.
 and


Ian's
 boy
 Ryan
 who's
 an
 engineer.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 while
 we're
 playing
 Call
 of
 Duty,
 um


Omar
 starts
 playing
 this
 guitar
 riff
 in


the
 back.


>> And
 I
 do
 this
 thing
 where
 I
 freestyle


over.
 If
 there
 is
 music
 playing,
 I
 might


there's
 a
 90%
 chance
 I'm
 going
 to


freestyle
 over
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 uh
 he
 starts
 playing
 this
 guitar


riff
 and
 I
 just
 say,
 "Why
 you
 always
 in


a
 mood
 [ __ ]
 around
 acting
 brand
 new?"


And
 he's
 like,
 "Yo
 yo,
 that's
 fire.


Like,
 go
 record
 that."
 So
 he
 lays
 down


the
 guitar.
 I
 go
 lay
 down
 the
 hook.
 I


write
 it
 in
 like
 five
 minutes.
 Like


yeah,
 it
 was
 so
 effortless.
 I
 was
 in


flow
 state
 for
 sure.
 And
 uh
 then
 Ian


goes
 and
 does
 his
 verse
 and
 I
 do
 my


verse
 and
 KBZ
 does
 the
 drums
 and
 we're


like,
 "Yo,
 this
 [ __ ]
 is
 tight."
 And
 I


think
 that
 was


>> that
 was
 within
 one
 night
 that
 happened.


>> Yeah,
 that
 was
 within
 like
 a
 couple
 of


hours.


>> Okay.
 So
 then
 So
 then
 when
 does
 Tik
 Tok


pick
 it
 up?
 Is
 this
 like
 March,
 May?


>> No.
 No.
 So
 it
 comes
 out
 in
 July
 and


>> All
 right.
 Summer.
 Right.
 Right.
 Right.


We
 we
 dropped
 a
 snippet
 of
 it
 the
 day
 we


shot
 the
 video.
 It
 got
 like
 100,000


views
 in
 like
 a
 couple
 days.
 And
 this


was
 pre-re
 too.
 So
 people
 were
 really


the
 algorithm
 wasn't
 like
 pushing
 the


reel
 directly
 to
 you.
 People
 were
 like


sending
 it
 around
 to
 their
 friends.


>> And
 then
 uh
 it
 picked
 up
 steam
 on
 TikTok


within
 like
 a
 couple
 weeks.
 There
 was
 a


dance.
 Um
 there
 was
 all
 these
 different


trends
 going
 and
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 whoa,


[ __ ]
 I
 think
 we
 I
 think
 we
 got
 one.
 But


getting
 a
 number
 one
 song
 is
 like
 it's


like
 winning
 the
 NBA
 championship
 like


the
 finals.
 Like


>> it
 doesn't


>> it's
 like
 finding
 a
 stock
 that
 can
 10x.


Like
 it's
 not
 easy.


>> You
 might
 get
 once.


>> Robin
 Hood
 at
 $7.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 you
 don't
 know
 if
 you're


going
 to
 get
 that
 again.


>> But
 you
 know,
 all
 you
 can
 do
 is
 [ __ ]


take
 the
 returns
 and
 put
 it
 back
 into


things
 you
 believe
 in.


>> Okay.
 So
 that
 song
 goes
 crazy
 and
 then


you
 build
 on
 that
 momentum
 with


Valentino
 and
 all
 these
 other
 hits
 that


you
 have.
 Um
 what
 has
 it
 been
 like
 over


the
 past
 five
 years?
 because
 there's


obviously
 a
 euphoric
 high
 just
 like


there
 is
 with
 a
 stock
 and
 then
 it
 kind


of
 dies
 down
 a
 little bit
 and
 you
 settle


into
 your
 career.
 So,
 how's
 that
 been


like?


>> Oh,
 well,
 I
 mean
 honestly
 when
 it
 was


going
 craziest
 was
 probably
 like
 the
 sim


it
 was
 it
 was
 simultaneously
 like
 the


highest
 point
 in
 my
 life
 and
 the
 lowest


point
 at
 the
 same
 time.


>> Like
 I
 was
 always
 a
 very
 like
 happy


go-lucky
 kid


>> but
 I
 think
 I
 had
 this
 idea
 in
 my
 head


of
 like
 once
 I
 get
 this
 big
 song
 or
 once


I'm
 like
 achieve
 these
 things
 that
 I
 set


out
 to
 achieve
 everything
 will
 be
 fine.


Yeah,


>> that
 getting
 there
 and
 realizing
 like,


oh
 [ __ ]
 everything
 is
 not
 fine.
 Like,


there's
 still
 things
 I
 have
 to
 work
 on.


There's
 still
 things
 I
 want.
 It
 was
 kind


of
 like


>> How
 old
 were
 you
 in
 the
 song


environment?


>> I
 was
 19
 when
 it
 went
 number
 one.


>> 19.


>> That's
 two
 billion
 people
 listening
 to


you
 at
 19.


>> And
 and
 keep
 in
 mind,
 it's
 also
 co
 too,


so
 I
 didn't
 get
 to
 like
 fully


experience
 like
 all
 the
 great
 things


that
 should
 happen
 when
 you
 have
 a


number
 one
 song.
 There
 was
 no
 tour.
 No,


>> there
 was
 there
 was
 no
 parties
 there.
 I


mean,
 there
 was
 parties,
 but
 it
 was
 like


there
 was
 there
 was
 I
 think
 I
 was
 in
 the


crib
 in
 my
 boxes
 playing
 2K
 the
 same
 way


that
 I
 was
 before
 I
 had
 this
 number
 one


song.
 So,
 those
 two
 things
 like
 I
 had
 to


hold
 both
 of
 them
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 So,


it
 definitely
 took
 like
 some
 adjustment


like
 you
 said
 to
 get
 used
 to
 like,
 okay,


well,
 like
 now
 what
 do
 I
 want
 to
 do?


Now,
 what
 is
 my
 life?


>> And
 um
 hey,
 because
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 be


the
 one
 hit
 wonder.
 you
 want
 to
 find
 the


next
 one
 and
 you
 want
 and
 then
 then
 you


want
 to
 get
 in
 love
 with
 the
 craft
 like


>> you
 know
 you
 find
 a
 stock
 it
 does
 well


but
 now
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 the
 guy


that
 just
 found
 one
 stock
 now
 you
 want


to
 research
 what
 it
 means
 to
 be
 an


investor
 you
 know
 so
 that
 you
 prove
 it's


not
 luck


>> yeah
 exactly
 and
 you
 know
 I'm
 lucky


enough
 that
 you
 know
 I
 I
 do
 have
 three


multiplat
 I
 mean
 a
 hand
 at
 this
 point


maybe
 five
 multi
 platinum
 songs
 and
 like


a
 platinum
 album
 and
 I'm
 able
 to
 tour


and
 like
 do
 all
 these
 things
 but
 um
 yeah


you
 can't
 be
 number
 one
 forever
 Drake's


gonna
 drop
 or
 Taylor
 Swift's
 gonna
 drop


and
 someone
 else
 is
 going
 to
 bump
 you


and
 you
 got
 to
 settle
 in
 and
 figure
 out


like,
 okay,
 well,
 if
 I'm
 not
 if
 I
 had
 to


figure
 out
 if
 I'm
 not
 doing
 this
 to
 be


number
 one
 every
 time,
 why
 am
 I
 doing


this?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And
 for
 me,
 it's
 cuz
 this
 is
 what
 I


[ __ ]
 love.


>> No.


>> And
 like
 my
 focus
 is
 not
 I
 don't
 feel


the
 pressure
 as
 much
 anymore
 to
 like


everything
 I
 do
 has
 to
 be
 number
 one.


But
 it's
 more
 like
 what
 do
 I
 have
 to


say?
 What
 do
 I
 want
 to
 create
 in
 the


world
 that
 doesn't
 exist?
 And
 just
 trust


that
 someone
 in
 the
 world
 is
 going
 to


resonate
 with
 it.
 And
 you
 can
 speak
 more


artistically
 once
 you
 have
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 the
 credibility
 without
 the


pressure
 of
 having
 to
 make
 it.


>> I
 because
 I
 already
 proved
 myself.
 I'm


already
 in
 the
 history
 books.
 You
 know,


now
 I
 just
 get
 to
 kind
 of
 like
 have
 fun


and
 experiment.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 your


portfolio.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 uh
 the


chat
 roast
 the
 portfolio.


>> Okay.


>> And
 we're
 how
 should
 I
 pull
 this
 up?


>> So,
 I
 I'll
 just
 put
 up
 a
 Google
 doc
 and


you
 tell
 me
 the
 portfolio
 itself
 and


then
 I'll
 just
 write
 this
 up
 here
 and


you
 guys
 can
 say
 yay
 or
 nay.
 How
 many


positions
 you
 have
 in
 total,


>> bro?
 I
 have
 way
 too
 many
 [ __ ]


positions
 because
 listen,
 I've
 been


investing
 since
 I
 was
 in
 fifth
 grade.


>> Okay.
 Wow.


>> So,
 I
 have
 I
 have
 [ __ ]
 that
 I
 bought


[ __ ]
 years
 ago
 that
 went
 up
 and
 down


and
 stayed
 down.
 Like,
 I
 was
 I
 was
 I
 was


on
 Wall
 Street
 Bets
 in
 high
 school.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 when
 like
 the
 whole
 medical


marijuana
 stock
 thing
 ran
 up,


>> I
 should
 have
 [ __ ]
 sold
 it
 because


now
 those
 positions
 are
 down
 and
 it's


all
 horrendous.
 Uh
 I
 transferred
 it
 from


I
 was
 um
 what
 the
 TDM
 trade
 bought
 this


>> Schwab
 bought
 TD
 trade.


>> Yeah,
 but
 there
 was
 a
 company
 that
 I


can't
 even
 remember
 what
 it's
 called
 but


before
 TDM
 so
 TD
 I
 had
 some
 [ __ ]


brokerage
 where
 you
 were
 still
 getting


charged
 to


>> No.
 Then
 TD
 bought
 that
 then
 Schwab


bought
 TD
 but
 I
 transferred
 everything


to
 Robin
 Hood
 and
 got
 my
 little
 like


bonus


>> uh
 earlier
 this
 year.
 So
 we'll
 go
 in
 one


by
 one.
 Let's
 go
 by
 what
 I
 hold
 the


most.


>> All right.
 Yeah,
 let's
 start
 off
 with
 uh


your
 top
 holdings,
 I
 guess.


>> So,
 my
 top
 holding
 in


>> Yeah,
 you
 could
 just
 say


>> VTI.
 Okay,
 fair.
 Play
 it
 and
 safe.


>> VXUS.


>> VXUS.


Okay.


>> And
 then
 Nvidia.


>> Nvidia.
 We'll
 talk
 about
 that.
 Some


bullish
 headlines
 after
 hours
 on
 that.


>> And
 then
 V,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 redundant


because
 I
 be
 a
 TI,
 but
 [ __ ]
 it.
 Uh,
 then


QQQ.


>> Okay.
 Heavy
 tech
 ETF.
 I
 like
 that.


>> And
 then
 Google.


>> The
 Googs.


They
 got
 so
 disrespected
 all
 year,


>> man.


>> So
 disrespected
 all
 year.


>> We
 woke
 a
 sleeping
 giant.
 And
 then
 hims.


>> Oh,
 you're
 gonna
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 people


happy
 with
 that
 one.


>> I
 hope
 so.
 Uh,
 then
 Apple.


>> Okay.


>> Then
 Hood.


>> Hoodie.


>> And
 then
 NBIS.


>> Nebus.
 I
 still
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 [ __ ]


spell
 Nebus.
 Is
 it
 Nebus?
 I


>> uh
 then
 Meta


and
 then
 JPI.


>> J
 covered
 calls.


>> Yep.
 Uh
 Oaklo.


>> Oaklo.


>> Tesla.


>> Okay.


>> ASTS.


>> Oh,
 you're
 gonna
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 dude.
 You


got
 some
 of
 these
 cold
 stocks.
 People


going
 to
 be
 happy.


>> Microsoft


ENS.


>> I
 like
 that
 one.
 Oracle.
 They
 got


earnings
 this
 week.
 That's
 a
 big
 one.


>> O.
 Realy.
 This
 is
 Oh.


>> Oh.
 All right.
 So,
 these
 are
 all
 your


top
 holdings,
 you
 would
 say.


>> This
 is
 my
 top.
 What
 is
 that?
 10
 20
 or


something
 like
 that.


>> Okay.
 So,
 then
 we'll
 move
 on
 to
 I
 guess


like


>> How
 many
 is
 that?
 One.


>> Yeah.
 Top
 20.


>> Then
 we'll
 do
 I
 guess
 like
 the
 mid
 part


of
 your
 portfolio.


>> So,


>> okay.
 We'll
 just
 call
 it
 second
 part.


>> Wait,
 I
 might
 have
 [ __ ]
 up.
 I
 think
 I


missed
 Oh,
 I
 missed
 Costco
 right
 after


Oaklo.
 I
 have
 a
 friend
 who
 is
 gonna
 uh


who's
 gonna
 hate
 you
 for
 that
 after


Oaklo
 Costco.


>> I
 have
 some
 good
 stories
 with
 these
 two.


So
 as
 we
 go
 through
 Okay.
 So
 then
 okay


after
 OB
 then
 the
 next
 one
 is
 uh
 Next


Air
 Energy
 NE.


>> Okay.

 Oh,
 I
 mean,
 Esco,


but
 I
 have
 like
 40
 bucks
 in

 Like


we're
 we're
 we're
 at
 stocks
 that
 have


like
 literally
 $5
 at
 this
 point.


>> Um
 yeah,
 Escov


Osur

 I
 think
 that
 was
 like
 a
 referral


bonus.
 Yeah,
 actually
 abos.


>> Okay,
 that's
 all
 of
 them.


>> Okay,
 that's
 all
 of
 them.
 How
 many
 is


this?
 Is
 it
 probably
 100
 plus
 issues?


>> It's
 about
 100
 plus.
 We're
 going
 to
 I'm


going
 to
 put
 this
 on
 a
 different
 screen


so
 it's
 easier
 to
 see.
 Um,


no,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 think
 you
 just


love
 owning
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 All right.
 So,


let
 me
 ask
 you,
 why
 do
 you
 own
 so
 many


names?
 I
 guess
 that
 would
 you
 define


>> the
 like
 keep
 in
 mind
 this
 is
 like
 uh


how
 how
 was
 that?
 So,
 this
 is
 like
 15


years
 of
 stuff,


>> right?
 And
 I
 don't
 really
 like


I
 enter
 a
 lot
 of
 positions
 and
 then
 I'll


exit
 positions
 and
 like
 keep
 a
 couple


shares
 in
 there
 for
 whatever
 reason,


>> right?


>> Um
 so
 like
 I
 I
 can
 break
 it
 down
 more
 as


we
 go
 through
 the
 list
 of
 why
 or
 what
 my


like
 thought
 was
 behind
 that
 or
 why
 do
 I


still
 have
 this
 thing.


>> Okay,
 bet.
 I'm
 going
 to


>> Yeah,
 it's
 gonna
 take
 up
 like
 10
 pages


on
 Canva.
 Yeah,
 let
 me
 make
 oldest


normal.


Okay,
 [ __ ]
 it.
 Let's
 just
 start
 with


these
 first.
 I'll
 share
 this
 screen
 and


then
 we'll
 keep
 on.
 All right,
 so
 how


many
 girlfriends
 though?
 That's
 that's
 a


better
 question.
 Okay,
 so
 let's
 start


off
 with
 your
 your
 top
 ones.
 So
 I
 guess


uh
 and
 and
 guys,
 if
 you
 have
 any


questions
 in
 the
 chat,
 put
 them
 in
 the


chat
 and
 we'll
 we'll
 ask
 them.
 But
 let's


start
 off
 with
 with
 these.
 So,
 um,


Nvidia,
 when
 did
 you
 start
 buying
 that


one?
 How
 do
 you
 think
 of
 kind
 of
 the
 AI


revolution?
 What
 do
 you
 think
 about
 this


whole
 AI
 bubble
 thing?
 And


>> so,
 I
 think
 I
 guess
 why
 do
 you
 hold
 it?


>> The
 first
 time
 that
 I
 bought
 Nvidia
 was


maybe
 like
 2018,
 2017.


>> Okay.


>> And
 my
 dad
 was
 like,
 yo,
 like
 my
 dad
 is


the
 one
 that
 got
 me
 into
 investing.
 And


he
 was
 like,
 yo,
 I
 I
 put
 because
 I
 was


on
 a
 custodial
 account
 for
 the
 long


time.
 He
 was
 like,
 I
 like
 this
 company.


They're
 like
 making
 these
 graphics
 cards


which
 didn't
 have
 the
 same
 use
 case
 that


they
 did
 now.
 Um
 but
 um
 he
 was
 like


computers
 are
 going
 to
 be
 bigger
 so
 you


should
 probably
 have
 some
 of
 this.
 I
 was


like
 okay
 all
 right.


>> And
 did
 your
 dad
 work
 in
 the
 computer


world
 or
 anything
 like
 that?


>> I
 mean
 no
 not
 not
 at
 all
 but
 he
 just


like
 is
 an
 avid
 researcher


>> of
 stuff.
 Also
 do
 you
 have
 a
 USBC


charger?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Right
 here.
 There
 you
 go.


Let
 me
 tap
 in.
 So
 that
 was
 the
 first


time
 I
 bought
 it.
 And
 um
 I
 think
 my
 cost


my
 average
 cost
 is
 like
 what
 is
 it
 94


bucks
 now.


>> I
 added
 a
 lot
 um
 when
 it
 had
 its
 like


first
 initial
 runup
 and
 then
 when
 it
 had


that
 big
 dip
 down
 to
 like
 the
 90s
 I


added
 a
 [ __ ]
 ton
 more.


>> Deepseek.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 when
 the
 Deep
 Seek
 thing


came
 out
 because
 I
 was
 like,


>> "Okay,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 overreaction
 by


the
 market
 and
 like


>> wow."
 Cuz
 Deepseek
 basically
 just
 made


it
 cheaper
 to
 run
 these
 LLM,
 right?


>> 100%.


>> So
 the
 thought
 the
 thesis
 was
 like,
 "Oh,


well,


>> more
 demand,
 not
 less
 than that."


>> Yeah.
 So
 that
 was
 my
 thing,
 like
 this


people
 are
 still
 going
 to
 need
 to
 buy


these
 cards
 and


>> if
 it's
 making
 it
 more
 accessible,


they're
 going
 to
 be
 more
 people
 that


needs
 these
 that
 need
 these.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 that
 was
 my
 thought
 on
 that.


>> Okay.
 So
 this
 whole
 like
 AI
 bubble
 thing


and
 like
 you
 know
 the
 world
 kind
 of


resting
 on
 Nvidia
 shoulders,
 how
 are
 you


you
 thinking
 of
 like
 does
 it
 make
 you


want
 to
 sell
 your
 Nvidia
 or
 does
 it
 make


you


>> I
 mean
 no
 not
 really.
 I
 I
 think
 it
 would


be
 foolish
 to
 expect
 that
 any
 stock
 is


just
 going
 to
 go
 up
 forever.
 But
 I
 think


the
 way
 that
 things
 are


going,


AI
 in
 some
 shape
 or
 form
 is
 going
 to
 be


a
 big
 part
 of
 the
 future
 of
 the
 world,


>> right?


>> And
 like


ju
 just
 because
 there
 was
 a
 a
 dot
 bubble


doesn't
 mean
 that
 the
 internet
 didn't


revolutionize
 the
 world,


>> right?
 It's
 just
 in
 the
 moment
 there


were
 some,
 you
 know,


>> there
 were
 some
 shitty
 tickers.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 Nvidia
 is
 a


shitty
 ticker
 and
 I
 I
 do
 think
 Jensen
 is


like
 a
 really
 great
 leader.
 So,
 I
 I
 put


my
 faith
 in,
 bro.


>> Okay.
 So,
 let
 me
 reshare
 this
 on
 chatbt


to
 make
 it
 easier.
 So,
 okay.
 So,
 Nvidia


is
 there.
 Then
 the
 ETFs
 um
 like
 are


those
 like
 your
 largest
 ones
 where
 you


just
 feel
 safe
 that
 your
 money
 every


month
 goes
 into
 those
 and
 you
 don't
 have


to
 worry
 too
 much.


>> Yeah,
 I
 do
 like
 like
 I
 have
 like


recurring
 purchases
 for
 I
 think
 what
 is


it?
 V
 now
 it's
 I
 started
 with
 V,
 but
 I


switched
 to
 VI.
 So
 for
 VTI
 or
 VTI.
 So


VTI
 uh
 VXUS
 V
 and
 then
 like
 one
 of
 the


uh
 I
 think
 JB
 or
 whatever
 the


>> cover


>> dividend
 one.
 Yeah.
 That's
 just
 like
 yo


I'm
 can
 put
 this
 money
 in
 here
 every


>> whatever
 the
 period
 is
 and
 know
 that


>> when
 I'm
 65
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 broke.


So
 that
 is
 like
 the
 foundation
 of
 my


portfolio.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that
 makes
 sense
 as
 well.
 Okay.
 So


then
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 googs.


>> Yeah.
 This
 one
 disrespected
 all
 year.


Uh,
 your
 music
 is
 on
 YouTube
 which
 is


owned
 by
 Google
 and
 it
 has
 billions
 and


millions
 of
 views.
 What
 was
 your
 thesis


when
 you
 bought
 Google?


>> So,
 I
 first
 bought
 Google
 like
 when
 I


was
 probably
 still
 in
 like
 middle
 school


or
 high
 school
 or
 something
 like
 that


>> just
 because
 I
 was
 watching
 YouTube.
 I


was
 searching
 it.
 Um,
 and
 obviously
 as
 I


got
 older
 and
 like
 I
 could
 grasp
 more


about


>> my
 my
 reasoning
 on
 why
 I
 buy
 something


changed.


>> Yeah.
 It
 it
 got
 to
 a
 point
 where
 I
 was


looking
 at
 all
 the
 things
 that
 they


owned
 like
 Whimo
 for
 example
 and
 like


how
 they
 have
 especially
 with
 AI
 they


have
 all
 the
 data
 they
 have
 the
 most


data
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 things
 like


Nano
 Banana
 Pro
 are
 so
 good
 because


whoever
 has
 the
 best
 training
 is


probably
 going
 to
 have
 the
 best


>> and
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 the
 most
 personal


lens.


>> Yeah.
 If
 if
 there
 if
 you
 had
 a
 personal


assistant
 that
 knew
 everything
 about


you,
 what
 you
 like,
 what
 you
 dislike,


where
 you
 want
 to
 go,
 it
 it
 can
 predict


things
 for
 you
 that


you're
 going
 to
 love
 before
 you
 even


know
 you
 love
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 that
 was
 my
 thesis
 on
 them.
 I
 added


a
 lot
 of
 Google
 this
 year.
 I
 think
 in


like
 130s,


>> I
 I
 put
 a
 pretty
 shot
 a
 pretty
 big
 clip


into
 them
 and
 it
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was


stagnant,
 bro.
 It
 was
 it
 was
 definitely


like


>> Okay.
 So
 when
 it
 was
 stagnant,
 what
 were


you
 would
 think
 when
 you
 saw,
 you
 know,


everything
 go
 into
 the
 meta
 in


particular,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 what
 in
 general
 my
 whole


thing
 is
 like
 a
 aside
 from
 what
 I
 try
 to


do
 is
 think
 like,
 okay,
 what
 can
 I
 hold


for
 because
 I'm
 25,
 right?
 So
 my
 time


horizon
 is
 a
 lot
 longer
 than
 somebody


that
 might
 be
 in
 their
 50s
 or
 40s
 even.


I
 don't
 have
 any
 kids.
 I
 don't
 really


have
 any
 I
 don't
 plan
 on
 having
 kids


anytime
 soon.
 So,
 I
 have
 I
 have
 so
 much


liquidity
 and
 like
 a
 long
 time
 horizon.


Like,
 what
 what
 do
 I
 think
 is
 going
 to


be


>> bigger
 and
 better
 10,
 20,
 30
 years
 from


now?
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 feel
 like
 Google
 is
 one
 of
 those


companies.


>> Okay.
 Um,
 Hoodie.


>> Yes.


>> Let's
 talk
 about
 this
 one.
 So,
 when
 did


you
 start
 buying
 Mr.
 Rocket?


>> So,
 I
 first
 bought
 Hood
 when
 it
 IPOed


>> around
 like
 10
 bucks.
 Was
 it
 13
 bucks?


10.


>> Yeah.
 Around
 about
 the
 time.
 Yeah.
 So
 I


I
 think
 I
 I
 can
 look
 at
 my
 trade
 history


on
 here,


>> but
 that
 one
 got
 screwed
 for
 three
 years


basically.


>> And
 Exactly.
 And
 when
 the
 whole
 GameStop


thing
 happened,
 I
 was
 one
 of
 the
 people


that
 thought,
 "Oo,
 this
 it's
 it's
 the


the
 backlash
 is
 going
 to
 be
 heavy.
 I


don't
 know
 what
 is
 going
 to
 happen."
 And


the
 uncertainty
 scared
 me.
 So
 I
 sold


>> I
 think
 Yeah,
 I
 sold
 all
 of
 my
 hood.
 And


then
 I
 got
 back
 in
 around


>> You
 also
 did
 a
 podcast
 with
 Vlad.


>> I
 did.
 Shout
 out
 Vlad.
 Um,
 crazy.


>> I
 think
 I
 got
 back
 in
 around
 whenever
 I


did
 that
 podcast.
 But
 let's
 see.
 Because


my
 cost
 basis
 on
 Robin
 Hood
 is
 what?
 97


bucks.


So,
 I've
 been
 buying
 up
 from


>> See,
 Hood
 is
 the
 one
 name
 that
 I've
 been


buying
 regardless
 of
 the
 price.
 Not


recently,
 but
 when
 it
 was
 30,
 40,
 50,


60,
 70,
 80,
 90,
 100
 up
 to
 120.


>> Just
 kept
 buying.


>> So,
 I
 bought
 20
 shares
 at
 38
 and
 I
 sold


my
 shares
 at
 $10
 like
 a
 [ __ ]
 dumbass.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 and
 but
 then
 I
 started
 buying


again
 in
 like
 the
 70s
 all
 the
 way
 up
 to


117
 was
 my
 last.


>> Were
 you
 impressed
 this
 year
 with
 like


tokenization
 and
 the
 credit
 card?
 Is


that
 I
 know
 it's
 probably
 just
 in
 your


feed.
 Yeah.
 Popping
 up
 like


>> Well,
 I
 follow
 you
 so
 I
 see
 all
 the


updates.


>> That's
 also
 true.
 I
 I
 sh
 it
 pretty
 hard.


But


>> but
 yeah,
 I
 was
 impressed.
 I
 I
 think


that
 when
 I'm
 talking
 to
 my
 friends
 and


like
 about
 investing
 and
 stuff,


everyone's
 using
 Robin
 Hood.
 I
 was
 using


Robin
 Hood
 more
 than
 I
 was
 using
 Schwab


and
 I
 didn't
 own
 any
 and
 I
 thought
 that


was
 stupid
 because
 the
 user
 interface


was
 so
 much
 better.
 Like
 like
 when
 I'm


on
 Schwab
 I
 feel
 like
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the


DMV
 terminal
 from
 the
 other
 side
 like


like
 I
 don't
 know
 Charles
 but
 yo
 you


gota
 get
 with
 the
 times
 brother.
 Um


>> I
 agree
 dude.
 I
 I
 was
 on
 my
 uncle's


Vanguard
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago
 and
 I
 was


like
 what
 is
 this?


>> Yeah.


>> Genuinely
 no
 one
 my
 age
 or
 younger
 which


is
 where
 all
 the
 baby
 boomer
 money
 is


going
 to
 is
 going
 to
 use
 this.
 We're


just
 not.


>> No.


>> And
 like
 just
 even
 looking
 at
 like
 the


market
 cap
 now,
 what
 is
 it?
 Uh


>> I
 think
 about
 120
 billion
 around
 130.


>> There's
 no
 way
 that
 it's
 not
 gonna
 at


least
 double
 like
 at
 a
 very
 bare


minimum.


>> I
 agree.


>> So
 yeah,
 that
 was
 my
 thoughts
 behind


that
 one.


>> Okay.
 Hims.


>> Hymns.
 Yeah,
 I
 you
 put
 me
 on
 to
 him.


>> Okay.
 Um
 especially
 with
 like
 the


[ __ ]
 ompic
 uh
 revolution
 and
 like
 all


>> them
 just
 having
 a
 cheaper
 version
 of
 it


compounded.


>> Yeah.
 Having
 a
 cheaper
 version.


[ __ ]
 is
 losing
 their
 hair
 out


here
 like
 yo
 what
 this
 is
 the
 looks


maxing
 generation
 like
 and
 this
 is
 where


the
 easiest
 place
 to
 go
 is
 to
 get
 it.


And
 I
 think
 with
 peptides
 and
 stuff
 like


that
 if
 they
 can
 incorporate
 that
 into


their
 like
 catalog
 of
 products
 it's
 just


going
 to
 go
 through
 the
 roof.
 Okay.


Apple.


>> Uh,
 Apple.


>> I I
 feel
 like
 Apple
 you've
 had
 for
 a


long
 time.


>> I've
 had
 Apple.
 That
 was
 like
 one
 of
 the


first
 stocks
 I'd
 ever
 bought.


>> Okay.


>> And
 I
 remember
 when
 it
 had
 this
 run
 up


to
 like


>> it
 was
 like
 two
 splits
 ago
 or
 three


splits
 ago.
 It
 ran
 up
 to
 I
 think
 like


900
 bucks
 or
 something
 like
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 was
 just
 looking
 at
 it
 like
 that


was
 that
 Apple
 is
 a
 stock
 that
 got
 me


really
 into
 investing.


>> You
 know,
 so
 many
 people
 have
 that
 same


story.
 So
 many
 people.


>> How
 long
 have
 you
 been
 using
 an
 iPhone?


cuz
 I've
 used
 this
 since
 2010.


>> I
 mean,
 iPhone.
 I
 didn't
 get
 an
 iPhone


until
 I
 was
 in
 like
 seventh
 grade.


>> But
 it
 was
 your
 first
 kind
 of
 phone.


>> No,
 my
 first
 phone
 was
 from
 Metro
 PCS.


It
 was
 a
 Huawei,
 which
 is
 banned
 now,
 I


think.


>> Yeah.


>> No,
 it
 wasn't
 even
 it
 was
 like
 a
 It
 was


like
 the
 shittiest
 like
 Android


smartphone
 you
 could
 get.
 And
 I
 remember


I
 used
 to
 play
 Fruit
 Ninja,
 but
 it
 was


so
 bad
 that
 it
 would
 be
 in
 like
 half


speed.
 So,
 it's
 like
 I
 could
 see
 all


great
 high
 score,
 great
 high
 score
 at


high,
 but
 I
 had
 an
 iPod
 touch
 at
 the


same
 time
 like
 um
 we
 were
 using
 iTunes.


Like
 I
 remember
 my
 my
 dad
 got
 his
 first


MacBook
 and
 like
 we're
 like
 minds
 blown.


>> Could
 you
 see
 yourself
 going
 to
 an


Android?


>> No.


>> No.


>> No.


>> Me
 too.
 I
 have
 debates
 about
 this
 all


the
 time.
 I'm
 like
 even
 if
 they
 have
 a


better
 AI
 assistant,
 I
 don't
 think


people
 are
 leaving.


>> And
 I
 think
 Android
 does
 have
 a
 better


product.
 like,
 but
 I'm
 so
 bought
 into


this
 ecosystem
 of
 Apple.
 I
 I
 just
 hope


that
 they
 like
 have
 some
 more
 innovation


that,
 you
 know,
 we
 came
 to
 know
 and
 love


from
 them.
 Uh,
 but
 yeah,
 love
 Apple.
 Uh,


I've
 been
 buying
 it
 since
 fifth
 grade.


Um,
 and
 just
 adding
 more
 whenever
 I
 felt


like
 it
 was
 undervalued.
 I
 got
 a
 bunch


in
 what's
 it
 at
 right
 now?
 Like
 280


something.


>> It's
 It's
 surprisingly
 hit
 all-time


highs.
 Uh,
 even
 though,
 you
 know,
 most


people
 counted
 them
 out
 this
 year.
 This


was
 one
 of the
 Mac
 7s
 I
 picked
 in
 my


ETF.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 friendly
 competition


I
 have
 with
 my
 friends.


>> Apple's
 the
 only
 Mac
 7
 I
 have
 there.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 it's
 up
 40%
 from
 the
 lows,
 which
 is


pretty
 crazy,


>> which
 is
 great.
 So,
 my
 average
 on
 that


is
 like
 a
 buck
 17.


>> A$17?


>> Oh,
 no.
 177.


>> Yeah.
 Now,
 yeah.


>> I
 was
 like,
 damn.


>> No,
 I
 wasn't
 alive
 when
 it
 was
 a
 dollar.


>> I
 was
 like,
 that's
 early.
 Um,
 okay.
 Uh,


Meta,
 is
 this
 a
 recent
 pickup
 or
 this


has
 been
 for
 a
 minute?


>> Um,
 Meta
 was
 more
 of
 a
 recent
 pickup.
 It


was
 another
 one
 of
 those
 where
 I
 like


kind
 of
 shhat
 on
 it
 and
 then
 it
 ran
 up


and
 then
 I
 was
 like
 I
 had
 some
 FOMO
 so
 I


fomoed
 in.
 Um,
 so
 my
 cost
 is
 like
 644


but


>> is
 Instagram
 part
 of
 I
 mean
 I'm
 assuming


you're
 on
 that
 app.


>> I
 am
 on
 Instagram.
 I
 am
 on
 Instagram
 a


lot.
 Probably
 more
 than
 I
 should
 be.


>> Why?
 Why?
 I
 mean,
 just
 for
 like
 work
 and


then
 you
 get
 in
 those
 like
 reals
 uh
 doom


scroll


>> loops
 and


>> Tik
 Tok
 is
 is
 been
 overflooded
 with
 ads


now.
 Like


>> I
 I
 I
 counted
 the
 other
 day
 and
 I
 went


like
 12
 scrolls
 all
 with
 a
 like
 a
 shop


link
 in
 there
 of
 some
 [ __ ]
 hair
 care


or
 some
 [ __ ]
 push-up
 board
 or


whatever.


>> It's
 like
 Chinese
 [ __ ]
 from


>> Teeu.
 Yeah,
 white
 label
 Teeu.
 It's
 the


new
 like
 FBA
 Amazon
 finesse.
 Um,


so
 I
 I
 like
 Meta
 in
 that
 regard.
 And


then
 also
 just
 seeing
 how
 it's
 one
 of


the
 like
 few
 founder


companies
 still
 that's
 in
 like
 the
 Mag


Seven
 and
 Love
 or
 Hate
 Mark.
 Um,


I
 don't know.
 He's
 done
 some
 really


great
 things
 and
 like,
 yeah,
 Meta
 was
 a


flop,
 but
 like
 he's
 going
 to
 keep


shooting
 and
 he's
 pushing
 for
 he's


pushing
 to
 like
 position
 himself
 in


whatever
 is
 going
 to
 be
 next.
 He
 was


kind
 of
 late
 to
 the
 he
 was
 pretty
 late


to
 the
 AI
 thing,
 but
 he's
 spending
 like


a
 [ __ ]
 So,
 we'll
 see
 if
 that


actually
 converts.


>> And
 are
 do
 you
 think
 the
 glasses
 are
 a


thing
 or
 glasses?
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 you're
 bullish
 on


>> I
 like
 the
 glasses.
 Do
 I
 think


everyone's
 going
 to
 use
 the
 glasses?
 I


don't
 know.
 But
 the
 new
 iteration
 with


the
 screen
 inside,
 I
 I
 I
 bought
 a
 pair


of
 Google
 glasses
 uh
 in
 like
 2019
 after


they
 were
 discontinued
 just
 cuz
 I
 wanted


to
 try
 it
 out.
 Now,
 I
 could
 never
 figure


out
 how
 to
 get
 them
 how
 to
 get
 them
 to


work.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 I
 never
 used
 them
 and
 I
 like
 broke


them
 the
 first
 time
 I
 I
 actually
 went


out
 the
 house
 with
 them.
 Uh
 but
 I
 think


the
 May
 the
 the
 Meta
 Ray-B
 bands
 are


like
 the
 sleekst
 form
 of
 that,


>> right?


>> Like
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 look
 like
 a


dweeb
 with
 those
 on.
 Okay.
 So,
 let
 me


ask
 the
 chat
 this
 question.
 We'll
 get


into
 some
 of the
 other
 tickers
 we
 have,


but
 um
 looking
 at
 all
 of
 these,
 if
 you


had
 to
 cond
 I'll
 put
 you
 on
 the
 spot.


Let's
 say
 we're
 going
 to
 condense
 it
 to


10
 tickers.


>> Oh,
 10.


>> Yeah.
 I'll
 just
 put
 this
 on
 my
 notes
 app


right
 here
 on
 my
 phone.
 If
 you
 had
 to


pick
 10
 out
 of
 all
 the
 and
 in
 the
 chat


as
 well,
 guys.
 If
 you
 had
 to
 condense,


so
 take
 a
 minute,
 look
 at
 all
 these


names,
 because
 I
 have
 around
 10
 to
 12.
 I


think
 most
 people
 in
 the
 chat
 have
 10
 to


12.
 I
 have
 a
 friend
 named
 Steve.
 He


probably
 has
 a
 couple
 hundred
 more


positions
 than
 you.
 So,
 you're
 like
 a


mini
 Steve
 here,
 but
 uh
 if
 you
 had
 to


boil
 it
 down
 to
 10,
 because
 I
 think
 as
 a


as
 a
 portfolio
 manager,
 it
 forces
 you
 to


to
 to
 figure
 out
 conviction,
 but
 also


balance
 massive
 upside
 with
 safety.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 would
 you
 buying
 the
 10
 at
 the


current
 valuation?


>> The
 10
 that
 you
 have
 from
 your


>> Okay.
 So,
 if
 I
 was
 selling
 everything


and
 keeping
 10,
 right?


>> Correct.
 Correct.


>> Um
 I
 would
 probably
 go


VTI.


>> Okay.
 So,
 that's
 your
 safety.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think


you
 need
 V
 or
 the
 other
 one.


>> No.
 Or
 VXUS.
 No.
 Yeah.
 Because
 the


chat's
 pretty
 comprehensive.
 Um
 I
 would


go
 Nvidia.


>> Okay.


>> I
 would
 go


Google.


>> Okay.
 So,
 we
 got
 two
 Mac
 7s.
 And
 then
 uh


>> I
 would
 go


Oh,
 this
 is
 so
 [ __ ]
 hard.


I
 mean,
 it's
 easier
 to
 decide
 what
 I


wouldn't
 go
 with.
 I'd
 probably
 go
 Robin


Hood.
 Um,


I
 keep
 Oaklo.


>> Oh,
 so
 you
 like
 did
 you
 get
 this
 one


early?


>> Yeah,
 I
 bought
 it
 for
 like
 $10,
 bro.


>> Dude,
 I
 had
 a
 friend.
 We
 were
 in
 a


coffee
 shop
 in
 the
 Bay
 Area.
 He
 said,


"Buy
 Oakland."
 It
 was
 $5
 and
 he's
 like
 a


VC.
 So,
 he's
 like, "We
 got
 into
 the


private
 round.
 We
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 do


well."
 I
 was
 like, "The
 [ __ ]
 out
 of


here.
 Some
 [ __ ]
 nuclear
 stuff."


>> That's
 That's
 my
 best
 pick
 I've
 ever


made.


>> I
 mean,
 yeah.
 [ __ ]
 $10
 to
 190.
 Not


bad.


>> So,
 what
 is
 it?
 How
 many
 more
 do
 I
 have


left?


>> You
 have
 five
 more
 left.


>> Uh,
 I'll
 probably
 do
 Tesla.


Do
 you
 have
 Oh,
 yeah.
 You
 have


>> I
 do
 have
 Tesla.


>> Okay.


>> Um


>> Nate,
 he's
 not
 picking
 Nebius.


>> I'm
 I'm
 kind
 of
 thinking
 Nebius,
 but


it's
 like
 if
 I
 only
 had
 to
 pick
 like
 the


I
 feel
 like
 the
 upside
 is
 potentially


massive


>> with
 Neb.
 But
 yeah,
 it's
 just


>> But
 it's
 like
 who
 knows,
 you
 know?


>> Like
 they
 if
 if
 all
 this
 AI
 [ __ ]
 kind
 of


gets
 some
 of
 the
 life
 sucked
 out
 of
 it,


they
 would
 be
 probably
 hit.


>> Yeah.


>> One
 of
 the
 hardest.


>> And
 they
 might
 dilute
 the
 [ __ ]
 out
 of


everybody,
 too.
 Yeah.
 Um,


Microsoft.
 It
 It
 would
 be
 very
 tech


heavy.


>> But
 I
 don't
 blame
 you
 for
 that.
 I
 really


don't.
 If
 you
 had
 to
 pick
 Ken
 for
 the


rest
 of your
 life,
 I
 do
 not
 blame.


>> Oh,
 this
 for
 the
 rest
 of
 my
 life.


>> Well,
 I
 mean,


>> for
 the
 foresee.


>> Yeah.
 For
 the


>> Okay,
 then.
 How
 many
 do
 I
 have
 left?


>> Three
 more.


>> Three
 more.
 I
 probably
 go
 him.
 Uh,


Costco.


>> Okay.
 Why?
 Why?
 Why
 Costco?


>> So,
 the
 reason
 I
 bought
 Costco
 stock


when
 I
 went
 to
 I
 went
 to
 USC
 for
 a
 year


before
 I
 dropped
 out.
 Yeah.
 And
 I
 was in


the
 Marshall
 School
 of
 Business.


>> Okay.


>> And
 I
 knew
 that
 I
 didn't
 want
 to
 keep


going
 to
 class
 after
 I
 signed
 my
 deal.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 I
 was
 on
 a
 full
 scholarship.
 So
 that


means


>> Why?
 Why'd
 you
 get on
 the
 scholarship?


>> It
 was a
 marriage
 scholarship.
 Yeah.


>> Kind
 of
 smart,
 I
 guess.
 Um


>> and
 uh


>> I
 had
 free
 food
 and
 free
 living.
 And
 I


was
 in
 LA
 and
 I
 needed
 to
 be
 there
 to


make
 music
 work.


>> So
 I
 figured
 out
 I
 could
 keep
 that
 as


long
 as
 I
 kept
 one
 class.
 And
 the
 one


class
 that
 I
 chose
 was
 called
 link,


learning
 in
 international
 commerce
 or


something
 like
 that.


>> And
 you
 learn
 about
 um
 businesses
 in


another
 country.
 Yeah.


>> And
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 semester,
 you
 get


to
 go


>> visit
 that
 country,
 take
 a
 trip
 there.


Yeah.


>> So
 I
 picked
 Japan
 because
 I
 always


wanted
 to
 go
 to
 Japan.


>> And
 when
 you're
 an
 anime
 guy?


>> Love
 anime.
 Yes.


>> I
 love
 it.
 And
 when
 we
 went
 to
 Japan,
 uh


we
 were
 taking
 all
 these
 tours
 of
 these


different
 companies
 and
 we
 ended
 up


going
 to
 Costco
 and
 they
 we
 got
 to
 meet


with
 like
 one
 of
 the
 [ __ ]
 heads
 of


Costco
 Japan
 and
 he
 was
 telling
 us
 how


big
 Costco
 was
 in
 Asia.
 Yeah.
 China,


Korea,
 Japan,
 and
 that
 whenever
 they


opened
 a
 new
 store,
 there
 would
 be
 a


line
 of
 hundreds
 if
 not
 thousands
 of


people.


>> We
 saw
 that
 earlier
 this
 year.


>> Waiting
 to
 to
 go
 check
 out
 [ __ ]


Costco.


>> Yeah.
 And
 as
 soon
 as
 I
 get
 back
 home,


I'm
 like,
 and
 he
 was
 telling
 us
 about


like
 we're
 opening
 this
 many
 stores
 and


like
 um
 in
 the
 future
 and
 like
 we're


planning
 on
 really
 leaning
 in
 on
 Asia.


This
 was
 2019.
 You
 took
 this
 class?


>> This
 was
 Yeah.
 2019.


>> So
 where
 was
 Costco
 stock
 during
 that


time?


>> 2019.
 That
 was
 300
 bucks.
 Round
 about


>> So
 around
 300
 bucks.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 So
 I'm
 like,
 whoa.
 I
 never
 even


considered
 that
 this
 would
 be
 a
 thing.


And
 then
 since
 then,
 like
 I've
 gone
 on


to
 like
 listen
 to
 like
 the
 founders


podcast
 about
 Costco
 and
 everything.
 And


I
 I
 I
 haven't
 added
 to
 my
 position
 since


then.
 It's
 just
 balloon.


>> It's
 just
 tripled
 on
 you.


>> Yeah.


>> Especially
 during
 co
 and
 I
 feel
 like


it's
 the
 only
 like
 retailer
 that
 people


enjoy
 going
 to.


>> I
 I
 agree
 with
 that.
 So
 what
 do
 you


think
 about
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 trades
 at
 a


higher
 PE
 than
 Nvidia?
 Like


>> it's
 like
 a
 55
 or
 something
 P.
 I
 don't


know
 why
 it
 does
 that.
 I
 really
 can't


tell
 you
 why.
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 why


everybody
 else
 loves
 it
 so
 much.
 Um
 but


it
 feels
 like
 one
 of
 those
 like
 backbone


kind
 of
 like
 safety


>> recession
 happens.
 It's
 going
 to
 be


okay.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 people
 like
 discounts


like
 there
 there's
 always
 going
 to
 be
 a


need
 to
 get
 things
 instantly
 even
 with,


you
 know,
 Amazon
 next
 day
 delivery.


>> Um


>> Okay.
 So,
 you
 have
 one
 more.


>> Okay.
 What
 do
 I
 have
 on
 here?
 Let
 me


see.


>> I
 noticed
 you
 don't
 have
 Amazon
 on
 this


list.


>> Oh,
 I
 do
 own
 Amazon.


Did
 I
 Did
 I
 not


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 I
 missed
 it
 after
 Google.


Okay,
 then
 I'll
 probably
 put
 Amazon.


Yeah,
 [ __ ]
 it.


>> Okay,
 so
 the
 top
 10
 is
 VTI,
 Nvidia,


Google,
 Hood,
 Oaklo,
 Tesla,
 Microsoft,


HMS,
 Costco,
 Amazon.


>> You
 know what's
 so
 crazy
 about
 this?
 I


think
 that
 we're
 talking
 a
 lot
 about


portfolio
 planning
 into
 2026.
 You've
 got


>> four
 Mag
 Sevens.
 It's
 hard
 to
 not
 have
 a


portfolio
 of
 an
 average
 of
 10
 names
 that


not
 have
 at least
 40%
 of
 the
 max
 on
 it.


It's
 just
 hard.


>> Yeah.


>> How
 do
 you
 not
 like
 how
 do
 you
 not
 even


I'm
 thinking
 of
 it
 going
 into
 next
 year.


How
 do
 you
 discount
 not
 being
 long
 one


of these
 names
 and
 take
 a
 risk
 on
 a


smaller
 name
 which
 could
 have
 way
 more


upside
 than
 Microsoft
 but
 it's
 freaking


Microsoft.
 It's
 Amazon.
 Amazon's
 up
 2%


this
 year.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 Like
 why
 am
 I
 going
 to
 be
 afraid


to
 take
 a
 bet
 next
 year?


>> I
 just
 bought
 a
 bunch
 of
 Amazon
 too


because
 I
 feel
 like
 it
 could
 have
 that


Google
 thing
 happen
 where
 it's


>> been
 stagnated.
 I
 know
 they've
 been


spending
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 that's
 been


like
 hurting
 their
 balance
 sheets,
 but


it's
 probably
 going
 to
 pay
 exponentially


over
 time.


>> Uh,
 how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 Palunteer
 in


general?


>> I
 I
 have
 Palunteer.
 I
 bought
 some
 at


like
 22
 bucks.


>> Wow.


>> Um,
 and
 I
 wish
 I
 [ __ ]
 bought
 more.


That's
 all
 I
 can
 say.


>> Do
 you
 have
 any
 thoughts
 on
 Karp
 as
 like


I'm
 sure
 you've
 seen
 clips
 of
 him
 and


stuff
 like
 that.
 You
 think
 he's
 kind
 of


just
 like
 one
 of
 those
 CEOs
 who
 like


doesn't
 care
 about
 anything?


>> I
 don't
 know,
 man.
 It's
 like
 he
 he
 got


like
 the
 like
 he's
 like
 a
 more
 frenetic


like
 lucky
 Palmer
 in
 a
 sense
 of
 like
 yo


I'm
 going
 to
 do
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 and


you're
 going
 to
 have
 feelings
 about
 it.


But
 he's
 very
 self-
 assured.


>> Yeah.


>> He's
 like
 I
 don't
 know.
 It
 doesn't


really
 worry
 me.
 Um
 he
 doesn't
 seem
 like


he's
 cr
 he's
 not
 crashing
 out.
 He's
 just


like
 moves
 around
 in
 his
 chair
 a
 lot.


Like


>> Yeah.


>> What
 do
 you
 think?


>> Well
 I
 I
 I
 just
 think
 having
 spoken
 to


the
 guy
 many
 times
 that's
 who
 he
 is.


He's
 dyslexic.
 If
 you
 read
 the
 book


about
 him
 recently,
 there's
 a
 lot
 that


he
 talks
 about
 around
 his
 dyslexia.
 And


I
 think
 it's
 just
 funny
 because
 over
 the


past
 couple
 days,
 people
 on
 Twitter
 were


making
 fun
 of
 him
 for
 moving
 in
 his


chair.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 this
 guy
 built
 a


$450
 billion
 company
 and
 people
 want
 to


make
 jokes
 that
 he's
 moving
 in
 his


chair.


>> I
 mean,
 that
 that's
 the
 thing.
 Like,


people
 are
 always
 looking
 for
 a
 reason


to
 try
 and
 hate
 or
 like
 be
 a
 naysayer
 or


a
 contrarian.
 And
 if
 that's
 the
 best
 you


got
 is
 that
 he
 [ __ ]
 moves
 around
 in


his
 chair
 a
 lot.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 what?
 Yeah.
 Uh
 Elon,
 how
 do
 you
 think


of
 him
 as
 a
 CEO?


>> Man,
 that
 that
 one
 has
 been
 like
 a
 an


interesting
 ride.
 I
 was
 also
 in
 Tesla


pretty
 early
 like
 pre
 FSD
 like
 probably


in
 2017
 2018.


>> Oh,
 wow.
 You
 were,
 dude.
 So
 you
 were


like,
 were
 you
 keeping
 up
 with
 the


markets
 at
 that
 time
 or
 it
 was
 just


because
 you
 had
 that
 custodial
 account,


you
 randomly


>> No,
 every
 every
 morning
 I
 would
 like


almost
 every
 morning
 I
 would
 look
 at


before
 I
 went
 to
 school,
 I
 would
 look
 at


it
 with
 my
 dad
 and
 like
 talk
 about
 like,


oh,
 this
 is
 doing
 good.
 This
 is
 down


today.
 Like
 and
 we
 just
 kind
 of
 just


chat.


>> Your
 dad
 really
 got
 you
 into
 this.


>> Yeah,
 he
 really
 did.
 Yeah.
 And
 um


with
 Tesla,
 like
 I
 I
 remember
 I
 went
 to


this
 auto
 show
 in
 um
 in
 San
 Francisco.


Uh
 and
 this
 was
 before
 they
 had
 the


Model
 S,
 the
 Model
 3,
 and
 it
 was
 just


the
 Tesla
 Roadster.
 Yep.


>> And
 I
 was
 like,
 "This
 is
 [ __ ]
 sick."


So,
 I've
 always
 been
 a
 fan
 of
 their


design
 choices.
 I
 like
 how
 Elon
 is
 like,


>> he's
 gonna
 [ __ ]
 push
 the
 [ __ ]


forward.
 He's
 going
 to
 say
 some
 crazy


[ __ ]
 and
 I
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 there's


anyone
 in
 the
 world
 that
 I
 agree
 on


everything
 with,
 but
 he's
 either
 going


to
 like
 change


the
 world
 as
 we
 know
 it
 in
 drastic
 dra


dramatic
 ways.
 Yeah.


>> Hopefully
 for
 the
 better,
 or
 he's
 just


going
 to
 crash
 out.


>> Um,
 but
 I
 I
 mean,


>> I
 I
 like
 the
 I
 like
 the
 full


self-driving.
 I
 like
 the
 idea
 of
 the


robo
 taxi.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 I
 feel
 about


the
 robots
 yet.
 Um,


>> do
 you
 do
 you
 see
 that
 future
 for


Optimus
 as
 like
 a
 $20,000
 robot
 being
 in


everyone's
 house
 and
 selling
 billions
 of


those?
 Because
 that
 to
 me,
 I
 think
 is


the
 next
 big
 scurve
 if
 it
 happens


because


>> totally.
 It
 just
 depends
 on
 how
 good
 it


is,
 you
 know?
 Because
 if
 you're
 going
 to


take
 longer
 than
 I
 would
 take
 to
 [ __ ]


unload
 the
 dishwasher
 or
 to
 fold
 my


clothes,
 then
 it's
 just
 like
 a
 show


pony.
 But
 if
 they're
 able
 to
 make
 it


good
 enough
 where
 it's
 like


it
 could
 do
 it
 better
 than
 me
 or
 faster


than
 me
 or
 then
 it's
 worth
 the
 money


because
 how
 much
 is
 a
 full-time


housekeeper
 salary,
 you
 know?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> $20,000
 is
 a
 drop
 in
 the
 bucket
 compared


to
 that.


>> 100%.
 Because
 I
 do
 you
 pay
 for
 like


chefs
 and
 housekeepers
 and
 stuff
 like


that.


>> Um
 I'm
 not
 that
 bougie.
 I
 uh
 I
 I
 cook


rarely
 but
 I
 postmade
 a
 lot and
 I
 do


meal
 prep.


>> Okay.


>> So,
 but
 uh
 I
 get
 my
 house
 clean
 like


once
 or
 twice
 every
 week.
 Do
 you
 have


like
 a
 you
 have
 a
 condo
 or
 a
 mansion
 or


how
 do
 you


>> I
 do
 like
 a
 condo.
 Okay.
 I
 I
 um


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 really
 buy
 any
 property


>> because
 I
 feel
 like
 especially
 in


California


>> with
 the
 fires,
 the
 crazy
 insurance


prices.
 Like


with
 with
 rent,
 I
 know
 that
 this
 is
 the


max
 that
 I'm
 paying
 every
 month
 with


home
 ownership,
 the
 mortgage,
 and
 the


that's
 the
 minimum
 you're
 paying
 every


month.


So,


>> I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 hate
 this
 take,


but
 it's
 funny
 because
 I'm
 28,
 you're


25.
 I
 have
 the
 same
 exact
 I'd
 rather


rent.
 And
 people
 hate
 hearing
 that,
 but


if
 you
 really
 dive
 deep
 into
 it,
 it's


not
 that
 crazy
 of
 a
 take.


>> No.
 Like,
 I'm
 sure
 you've
 seen
 like
 the


New
 York
 Times
 rent
 to
 own
 calculator.


I'm
 like,
 yo,
 I'd
 have
 to
 stay
 in
 this


place
 for
 like
 20
 or
 30
 years
 to
 to
 to


make
 it.
 I
 have
 to
 buy
 a
 home
 and
 stay


there
 for
 20
 to
 30
 years
 to
 make
 it.


>> And
 you're
 traveling
 so
 much.


>> Yeah.
 Like,
 so
 what's
 the
 point?
 And


like,
 my
 building
 has
 security.
 I
 don't


have
 to
 worry
 about
 anyone
 breaking
 in.


Like
 it's
 they
 collect
 my
 packages.
 It's


it's
 just
 so
 much
 more
 convenient
 and


whatever
 money
 I'd
 rather
 just
 put
 it


into
 the
 market
 because
 I
 think
 that's


going
 to
 go
 up
 more
 than
 my
 the
 value
 of


my
 house
 would.


>> Okay,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 question.
 Why
 don't


you
 own
 Spotify
 stock
 even
 though
 you're


an
 artist?
 I
 think
 let's
 get
 into
 the


music
 business
 side
 of


>> So
 Spotify's
 had
 a
 great
 year.
 Um


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 just
 never
 really
 felt


compelled.
 I
 I
 use
 Spotify,
 but
 it's


like
 streaming
 is
 actually
 I
 think
 for


the
 first
 time
 gone
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 uh


in
 this
 last
 year.


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 there's
 been
 a
 lot
 of
 talk


of
 this
 year
 has
 not
 had
 that
 hit
 album


that
 kind
 of
 like
 really
 I
 don't know,


just
 music's
 been
 kind
 of
 a
 little
 flat


this
 year.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 it's


different
 than
 like
 like
 it's
 it's
 it's


if
 you
 would
 have
 told
 somebody
 60
 years


ago,
 40
 years
 ago,
 that
 you
 can
 have
 the


entirety
 of


the
 music
 library
 of
 the
 world
 for
 $10
 a


month,
 they
 would
 look
 at
 you
 crazy.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 but
 it
 gets
 to
 a
 certain
 point
 where


like
 I
 think
 very
 soon
 everybody
 that


wants
 to
 be
 a
 part
 of
 that
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 subscriber.
 the
 growth
 is
 not
 as


they
 want
 to
 get
 to
 a
 billion
 monthly


activives.
 I
 think
 they
 have
 700


million.
 So
 for
 you,
 you're
 thinking


it's
 not
 as
 asymmetric
 anymore.


>> Yeah,
 cuz
 I
 mean
 like
 okay,
 they
 want
 to


get
 to
 a
 billion.
 I
 think
 that's
 doable,


but
 populations
 are
 declining.
 Like


where
 are
 we
 going
 to
 go
 from
 here?


>> And
 and
 the
 people
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 the


700
 million
 people
 that
 pay
 for
 it,
 a


lot
 of
 them
 are
 paying
 like
 two
 three


bucks
 a
 month
 in
 India.
 Yeah.
 Not
 paying


15
 American
 dollars.


>> No.
 No.


>> Okay.
 So
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 the
 the


business
 of
 music
 then.
 So,
 I
 want
 to


get
 into
 record
 labels.
 You
 signed
 your


first
 deal.


>> I
 was
 It
 was
 4
 days
 after
 I
 turned
 18.


>> Okay.
 So,
 walk
 me
 through
 that
 because
 I


signed
 some
 contracts
 when
 I
 was
 that


age
 that
 like
 there
 was
 I
 I've
 never


told
 the
 story
 online
 and
 I
 don't
 want


to
 get
 into
 it,
 but
 I
 signed
 a
 deal
 to


start
 a
 company
 that
 I
 was
 like
 uh
 the


head
 director
 of.
 I
 should
 have
 had
 a
 I


should
 have
 had
 a
 minimum
 10%
 equity


stake
 in,
 but
 the
 guy
 showed
 gave
 me
 a


contract
 of
 a
 revenue
 share.


>> And
 and
 my
 dumbass
 was
 like,
 "Oh,
 I'm


getting
 part
 of
 the
 revenue."
 So,
 I'm


like,


>> I
 own
 part
 of
 it.
 Yeah,


>> I
 did
 not
 own
 any
 of
 it.
 And
 then
 we
 had


a
 falling
 out
 a
 couple
 years.
 Not
 not


anything
 malicious
 or
 anything
 like


that,
 but
 I
 just
 moved
 on
 with
 my
 life.


I
 should
 have
 I
 should
 be
 collecting


royalty
 checks
 from
 that
 business


because
 I
 was
 pretty
 instrumental
 back


in
 2017,
 2018
 getting
 it
 started.


>> Um,
 and
 I
 missed
 out
 on
 that
 equity.
 So,


how
 was
 that
 situation
 like
 for
 you?
 And


do
 you
 think
 you
 signed
 a
 good
 deal
 or
 a


bad
 deal?
 So,
 I
 was
 telling
 you
 a
 little


bit
 about
 this
 before
 we
 went
 live,
 but


if
 if
 you
 went
 to
 like
 a
 VC
 with
 the


terms
 that
 these
 that
 is
 standard
 for


the
 industry,
 the
 music
 industry,
 like


the
 it's
 it's
 it's
 the
 craziest
 deals


you've
 ever
 heard
 of.
 So,
 I'll
 give
 you


an
 example,
 right?
 A
 standard
 royalty


deal
 in
 music,
 just
 to
 make
 the
 numbers


easy,
 is
 it's
 normally
 like
 18%,
 but


let's
 say
 it's
 20%,
 right?
 until
 you
 get


a
 20%
 royalty.


>> Meaning
 every
 time
 your
 song
 gets


played,
 you
 get
 20
 cents
 on
 the
 dollar.


>> Uh
 yeah.
 Every
 time
 you
 get
 a
 every
 time


your
 song
 earns
 a
 dollar,
 you
 get
 20


cents,
 right?
 And
 how
 it
 works
 is
 they


they
 advance
 you.
 So
 let's
 say
 you
 get
 a


million
 dollar
 deal
 and
 you
 have
 a
 20%


royalty
 rate.


>> Yeah.


>> Your
 music
 needs
 to
 make
 $5
 million
 for


you
 to
 be
 even
 with
 the
 record
 label.


>> And
 that
 means
 they've
 made
 $4
 million.


Well,
 technically
 what?
 Uh
 yeah.
 Yeah.


$4
 million


and
 you
 are
 just
 even
 with
 them,


>> right?
 But
 you
 got
 the
 advance,
 which
 is


why
 they're
 saying,
 "Hey,
 you
 got
 your


money
 guaranteed.
 We
 took
 a
 risk
 with


your
 music
 even
 being
 streamed
 in
 the


first
 place."


>> Yeah.
 But
 if
 I
 said,
 "Yo,
 I'll
 give
 you


a
 million
 dollars
 for
 80%
 of
 your


company
 and
 you
 don't
 see
 any
 money
 from


that
 until
 you
 pay
 me
 back
 my
 million


dollars."


>> It'
 be
 a
 horrible
 deal.


>> Yeah.
 It
 would
 be
 an
 awful
 deal.
 Um,
 and


now,
 you
 know,
 there's
 the
 labels
 are


doing
 like
 less.
 So,
 there's
 more


leverage
 for
 artists
 because
 they're


like,
 I
 know
 you're
 not,
 this
 isn't
 19,


this
 isn't
 2005.
 You
 can't
 just
 put
 me


on
 MTV
 and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 a


[ __ ]
 star.
 Yeah.


>> A
 lot
 of
 that
 groundwork
 and
 like


marketing
 and
 everything
 has
 to
 come


from
 the
 artist
 side.


>> So,
 but
 but
 with
 that
 being
 said,
 when
 I


signed
 my
 deal
 when
 I
 was
 18,


>> I
 didn't
 have
 a
 huge
 song.
 I
 had
 very


little
 leverage,
 you
 know.


>> Why
 did
 you
 get
 signed?
 Uh,
 I
 got
 signed


because


I
 uh
 I
 had
 this
 song
 called
 Balling
 Like


Share
 on
 Soundcloud.


>> Okay.


>> And
 I
 was
 like
 super


>> Shaq's
 son,
 right?


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 This
 was
 around
 the
 time
 of


Moamba.
 Yes.


>> And
 I
 figured
 like,
 okay,
 if
 someone
 can


make
 a
 song
 about
 a
 college
 basketball


player,
 what
 if
 I
 make
 a
 song
 about
 a


high
 school
 basketball?


>> That
 is
 creativity,
 bro.
 That
 is
 getting


your
 [ __ ]
 out
 there.
 And
 um
 and
 uh
 yeah,


so
 I
 I
 put
 that
 out
 and
 I
 was
 like
 doing


all
 my
 own
 digital
 marketing
 and


everything.
 And
 part
 of
 that
 was
 I
 would


tweet
 and
 email
 and
 harass
 blog
 writers.


And
 this
 one
 writer
 uh
 for
 DJ
 Booth,
 he


dropped
 this
 article


um
 that
 was
 like
 the
 the
 like
 uh
 just


defending
 Soundcloud
 artists
 and
 saying


like,
 "Yo,
 like
 you
 shouldn't
 judge
 an


artist
 based
 on
 the
 platform
 they
 put


their
 music
 on.
 You
 should
 judge
 if
 it's


actually
 good
 or
 not."


>> Because
 SoundCloud
 rappers
 get
 the
 whole


like
 they're
 not
 serious.


>> We
 get
 a
 bad
 name.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> And


>> I
 was
 a
 Soundcloud
 rapper,
 too.


>> You
 were
 Okay.
 My
 brother.
 My
 brother
 in


Orange


>> didn't
 work.
 But


>> uh
 and
 um
 at
 the
 end
 of
 his
 article,
 he


was
 like,
 "So
 I
 I'm
 opening
 this
 the


floor
 up.
 If
 you're
 a
 Soundcloud
 rapper,


send
 me
 your
 song.
 I
 promise
 I'll
 listen


to
 at least
 30
 seconds
 of
 it."
 So
 I
 was


probably
 the
 first
 person
 I
 was
 the


first
 reply
 to
 that
 article.
 I
 tweeted


him
 Balling
 Like
 Sharief.
 I
 emailed
 him


Balling
 Like
 Sharie.
 I
 DM'd
 him
 Balling


Like
 Sharief.
 And
 he
 did
 a
 follow-up


article
 a
 week
 or
 so
 later.
 And
 he
 was


like,
 "I
 listen
 to
 these
 Soundcloud


rappers.
 Here's
 what
 I
 thought."
 Ah,


>> and
 out
 of
 all
 the
 songs,
 he
 spoke
 the


highest
 of
 mine.
 And
 I
 guess
 there
 was


some
 people
 in
 the
 industry
 that
 saw


that.
 Um,
 I
 got
 reached
 out
 to
 for
 one


deal.
 It
 ended
 up
 following
 through.
 But


simultaneously,
 this
 producer
 DA
 got


that
 dope.


>> I
 Yeah,


>> you
 know,
 he
 read
 it
 too,
 I
 guess.
 And


he
 sent
 me
 an
 email
 and
 it
 was
 like,


"Yo,
 what
 else
 do
 you
 have?"
 And
 I
 sent


him
 Valentino


>> and
 he's
 like,
 "Yo,
 this
 [ __ ]
 is


insane."
 keep
 I
 made
 that
 song
 in
 high


school
 and
 I
 held
 it
 because
 I
 knew
 it


was
 so
 good
 that
 it
 needed
 some
 push


behind
 it.
 You


>> held
 it
 for
 three,
 four
 years.


>> I
 held
 I
 made
 it
 in
 2017
 and
 it
 came
 out


>> 2021
 I
 think.


>> 2019.


>> 2019.


>> Yeah,
 it
 came
 out
 2019.
 So
 I
 held
 it
 for


like
 almost
 Yeah.
 two
 years.
 And
 uh


so
 I
 come
 out
 to
 LA,
 we
 meet,
 we
 make


more
 songs
 and
 he
 just
 got
 a
 job


consulting
 at
 my
 label
 now
 records
 which


is
 uh
 part
 of
 like
 the
 Sony


infrastructure.
 Yeah.


>> And
 he
 hits
 me
 up
 when
 cuz
 he
 knows
 I'm


moving
 to
 LA
 for
 college
 and
 he
 hits
 me


up
 and
 he's
 like,
 "Yo,
 are
 you


interested
 in
 signing
 cuz
 I'm
 working


with
 this
 label
 right
 now
 and
 they
 keep


sending
 me
 people
 and
 all
 I
 can
 think


about
 is
 how
 much
 better
 your
 music
 is


than
 everyone
 else
 is
 sending
 me."
 So,


he
 opened
 the
 door
 to
 that
 conversation.


I
 signed
 with
 Records
 in
 Colombia.
 They


like
 flew
 me
 out
 to
 New
 York
 to
 meet


everybody
 before
 I
 decided
 if
 I
 want
 to


sign
 or
 not.
 And
 I
 think
 my
 advance
 for


that
 was
 like
 $100,000,
 which
 was


>> That
 was
 your
 first
 deal
 you
 signed.


That
 was
 my
 first
 deal.


>> To
 you
 at
 the
 time
 probably
 was
 like


>> it
 was
 more
 money
 than
 both
 of
 my


parents
 made
 combined.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 was
 18
 years
 old,
 you
 know.
 So
 I'm


like,
 yo,


[ __ ]
 it.
 I'll
 bet
 on
 myself.
 And
 I
 take


the
 money
 and
 we
 put
 the
 song
 out.


Valentino,
 nothing
 happens
 for
 eight


months.
 Then
 it
 blows
 up
 on
 TikTok.
 I


realize,
 oh,
 this
 is
 new
 emerging


platform.
 What
 if
 I
 leverage
 my
 song's


popularity
 to
 make
 me
 popular
 on
 there?


So
 I
 start
 making
 videos.
 I
 blow
 up


other
 songs
 and
 then
 that
 was
 kind
 of


the
 start
 of
 that.


>> Okay.
 So
 that
 was
 the
 first
 deal.
 What


was
 the
 second
 big
 deal?


>> So
 the
 second
 big
 deal
 we
 did
 after


Yeah.
 We
 did
 a
 renegotiation
 and
 I


really
 wanted
 to
 switch
 it
 from
 royalty


to
 a
 profit
 sharing
 agreement.


>> Okay.


>> But
 I
 wasn't
 able
 to
 make
 that
 happen


because
 in
 their
 mind
 they're
 like,


"Okay,
 we're
 renegotiating,
 but
 we
 could


also
 not
 re
 their
 their
 incentive
 is
 we


want
 to
 sign
 you
 on
 for
 longer.
 We
 want


more
 albums.
 Right.


>> Um,
 but
 they
 could
 also
 be
 like,
 "Well,


we'll
 just
 take
 the
 other
 the
 last
 album


that
 you
 have
 left
 and


>> keep
 your
 18%
 royalty
 or
 whatever
 it
 is


>> on
 this
 massive
 [ __ ]
 banger
 and
 we'll


be
 fine."
 So,


>> unfortunately,
 I
 wasn't
 able
 to
 turn
 it


into
 a
 revenue
 sharing
 agreement,
 but
 I


got
 a
 nice
 bump
 on
 my
 royalties,
 right?


And
 they
 gave
 me
 like,
 I
 don't
 know,
 a


couple
 million
 dollars
 or
 whatever.


Right.


>> So,
 so
 for
 you
 it
 was
 more
 so
 about,


hey,
 let
 me
 get
 this
 advance
 and
 let
 me


invest
 that
 money
 then
 instead
 versus


trying
 to
 negotiate
 something
 that's


going
 to
 be
 really
 hard
 to
 negotiate.


Did
 you
 ever
 think
 of
 going
 fully


independent
 like
 Russ
 or
 some
 of
 those


guys?


>> Totally.
 Especially
 now.
 But
 the
 thing


is
 like
 I'm
 I
 can't
 get
 out
 of
 my
 deal


until
 I
 fulfill
 my
 contractual.


>> How
 many
 albums
 you
 have
 left?


>> I
 think
 I
 have
 two
 albums
 left
 or


something
 like
 that.


>> Got
 it.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 kind
 of
 crazy
 because
 you've


heard
 I
 mean
 everyone's
 heard
 these


stories
 about
 like
 360
 deals
 and
 getting


trapped
 in
 that
 and
 all
 this
 stuff.
 Um,


but
 I
 think
 the
 independent
 route
 is
 so


much
 more
 possible.
 Like
 I
 mean
 I'm


independent.
 I
 mean
 so
 many
 times
 people


ask
 like
 why
 don't
 you
 sign
 with
 like


CNBC
 or
 Bloomberg
 or
 I'm
 like
 well
 it's


just
 more
 fun
 doing
 it
 myself
 and
 I
 can


say
 whatever
 I
 want.
 I
 can
 have
 whatever


guests
 I
 want.
 I
 can
 be
 the
 personality


that
 I
 want
 to
 be.
 And
 second
 of
 all,


yeah,
 those
 guys
 will
 offer
 you
 a
 big
 mo


like
 the
 the
 best
 CNBC
 hosts
 make
 like


>> you
 think
 millions
 a
 year.
 They're


making
 five
 to
 10
 now.
 I
 mean,


>> Jim
 Kramer
 is
 making
 five
 to
 10
 making


more
 than
 10.


>> Oh
 my
 god.


>> Jim
 Kramer
 has
 had
 his
 show
 on
 for


almost
 20.
 He's
 probably
 making
 like
 20.


>> Jesus.


>> But
 Andrew
 Ross
 Sorcin,
 Becky
 Quick.


Now,
 but
 the
 thing
 is
 two
 things.
 Number


one,
 they
 can't
 invest.


>> Oh.


>> Because
 they
 talk
 they
 talk
 about
 the


stock
 market
 all
 day.
 So
 they
 can
 own


like
 the
 S&P
 500,
 but
 they
 can't


actually
 because
 they
 get
 the
 breaking


news
 early
 and
 all
 this
 stuff.
 So
 they


can't
 invest.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 number
 two,
 it's
 just


like


>> it's
 boring
 being
 in
 that
 corporate


atmosphere
 versus
 being
 able
 to
 do
 your


own
 thing,
 you
 know?
 Yeah.
 And
 so
 I


think
 like
 the
 freedom
 of
 going


independent
 is
 something
 a
 lot
 more


people
 are
 excited
 about.


>> But
 you
 got
 to
 keep
 this
 in
 mind
 too.


Like
 for
 every
 me
 that
 signed
 for


$100,000
 and
 then
 had
 success
 and
 was


able
 to
 like
 build
 external
 revenue


sources.
 Yeah.


>> There's
 99
 people
 that
 didn't,
 you
 know,


that
 they
 took
 the
 $100
 or
 $100,000
 and


thought
 they
 were
 going
 to
 have
 this


level
 of
 success
 and
 they
 buy
 a
 chain
 or


a
 car
 or
 whatever
 and
 then
 that's
 it.


And
 like
 I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 young
 kids


getting
 signed
 at
 the
 age
 I
 got
 signed,


18,
 19,
 even
 like
 in
 their
 20s.
 And
 like


you
 have
 this,
 they
 sell
 you
 a
 dream,


you
 know,
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 make
 you


into
 a
 star.
 And
 it
 just
 it
 doesn't


always
 work
 out
 like
 that
 for
 everybody.


So


I
 definitely
 [ __ ]
 off
 like
 a
 decent


amount
 of
 money.
 Like
 I
 spent
 $15,000
 on


Supreme
 jackets.
 And
 I
 as
 my
 next


question
 like
 what
 when
 when
 was
 the


splurge
 when
 you
 got
 rich?
 like


>> like
 but
 but
 I
 I
 so
 I
 very
 very
 strongly


believe
 when
 you
 get
 a
 big
 bag
 of
 money


and
 you're
 young,
 you
 have
 to
 [ __ ]
 some


of
 it
 off
 to
 get
 it
 out
 of
 your
 system


and
 like
 be
 like,
 "Okay,
 well,
 I
 did


that.
 Oh,
 maybe
 I
 don't
 maybe
 I
 don't


need
 three
 Supreme
 North
 Face
 jackets.


Maybe
 I
 live
 in
 Los
 Angeles
 and
 I
 never


have
 a
 chance
 to
 [ __ ]
 wear
 this.
 That


was
 kind
 of
 dumb."


>> So
 that
 the
 next
 time
 that
 you
 have
 it,


you
 know,
 hopefully
 there's
 the
 next


time
 you
 don't
 do
 that
 same
 thing.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 I
 did
 buy
 as


a
 [ __ ]
 off
 that
 turned
 around
 and
 became


a
 good
 investment.


>> No,
 I
 knew
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 with
 the


watches,
 but
 because
 I
 was
 24k
 gold
 and


all
 the
 jewelry
 that
 I
 bought
 at
 first


was
 24
 karat
 gold.
 And
 this
 was
 in
 2019


to
 20
 2018
 to
 2020.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 gold


price
 was
 like
 what
 maybe
 like
 2400
 an


ounce
 or
 1,600
 an
 ounce.


>> It's
 doubled
 basically.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 spent
 50
 grand
 on
 24
 karat


jewelry
 and
 now
 it's
 worth
 100
 grand.


>> Yeah.


>> Which
 is
 great.
 Um,
 watches,
 too.
 I
 love


watches.
 I'm
 wearing
 uh
 Can
 you
 see
 it


in
 there?


>> Let's
 put
 this
 here.


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 I'm
 wearing
 a
 Royal
 Oak


chronograph
 white
 gold
 with
 like
 a


frosted
 finish.


>> How
 much
 is
 that?
 Let
 me
 guess.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.
 Guess
 retail


>> $25,000.


>> This
 is
 86.


>> This
 is
 $86,000


>> with
 sales
 tax.
 Yeah.


Oh,
 this
 is
 an
 AP.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Oh,
 I
 was
 thinking.
 Okay.
 So,
 nice


watch.
 Um
 the
 market
 is
 definitely
 like


dumped
 since
 the
 crypto


uh
 scammer


overnight
 millionaire
 like
 phase
 of


2021.


>> What
 market
 is
 dumped?


>> The
 like
 the
 watch
 market
 in
 general.


>> Real
 crypto
 affected
 the
 watch
 market.


Well,
 yeah,
 because
 all
 these
 people
 are


getting
 crazy
 checks
 off
 crypto.
 And


that's
 why
 you
 have
 these
 like
 kids
 in


Miami
 with
 full
 Chrome
 Hearts,
 AP,


whatever
 the
 [ __ ]
 And
 um
 but
 at
 least
 I


know
 that
 whatever
 I
 bought
 this
 for,


cuz
 I
 only
 buy
 for
 retail.
 Yeah.


>> I'm
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 get
 exactly
 that


back,


>> right?


>> At
 a
 bare
 minimum,


>> right?


>> So,
 I
 have
 a
 couple
 watches.
 Yeah.


>> What?
 Okay.
 So,
 this
 is
 a
 good
 question.


How
 much
 did
 Mood
 make?
 Two
 billion


streams.
 So,
 I
 I
 I've
 never
 gotten
 a


royalty


check
 from
 my
 label


>> on
 on
 mood
 or
 just
 any
 song


>> on
 any
 song.
 I've
 never


>> That's
 just
 how
 the
 deal
 is
 structured


>> because
 Yeah.
 Whatever
 they've
 spent


promotion
 or
 videos
 or
 whatever
 I
 have


not
 made
 five
 times,
 which
 I
 probably


should
 do
 audit
 because
 that
 seems
 a


little


>> Yeah.


>> off.
 But
 they
 gave
 you
 a
 few
 million
 in


the
 beginning
 to
 which
 to
 be
 honest,


I've
 heard
 it's
 like


>> uh


$2
 per
 every
 4,000
 streams,
 something


like
 that
 on
 Spotify.


>> Uh
 yeah.
 And
 then
 for
 a
 million,
 every
 a


million
 streams
 is
 $4,000.


>> Okay.


>> In
 between
 master
 and
 publishing.


>> Okay.
 So,
 if
 you
 theoretically
 break


down
 all
 the
 things
 you'd
 have
 to
 pay


after
 two
 billion
 streams,
 you
 probably


end
 up
 with
 a
 couple
 million
 left.


>> Like
 dollars
 or
 or
 streams?


>> Yeah,
 dollars.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah,
 but
 then
 you
 know
 like
 I
 did


dumb
 stuff
 like
 I
 had
 like
 a
 quarter


million
 dollar
 music
 video.
 So
 now


that's
 another


>> what
 $1.25
 million
 on
 my
 balance
 sheet


that
 I
 have
 to
 earn
 against.
 So
 it's


like
 I
 I
 really
 I
 probably
 will
 do
 an


audit
 soon
 just
 to
 kind
 of
 get
 some


clarity
 on
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Um,


but
 uh,
 so
 I
 I
 never
 expected
 to
 make


any
 money
 off
 of
 the
 actual
 records


until
 I'm
 out
 of
 that
 deal
 and
 then
 this


back
 catalog
 over
 time
 because
 Mood
 is


going
 to
 stream
 probably
 forever.


>> Forever.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then
 I
 get
 my
 masters
 back
 and


everything.
 I
 can
 do
 a
 catalog
 sale
 and


whatever.


>> Okay.
 So
 that
 that
 that's
 I'm
 happy
 you


said
 that
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 rappers
 and


artists
 I'm
 realizing
 are
 starting
 to


say
 screw
 the
 music.
 the
 the
 the
 the


distribution
 of
 the
 music
 is
 what
 I'm


gonna
 use
 to
 then
 go
 on
 tour
 merch.
 So


touring,
 how
 is
 that?
 Is
 that
 a


lucrative
 endeavor
 for
 you
 or?


>> Yes
 and
 no.
 So
 because


my
 biggest
 moment
 thus
 far
 was
 during


COVID,
 I
 didn't
 get
 to
 do
 these
 massive


shows
 that
 I
 probably
 would
 have
 been


doing
 had
 there
 the
 world
 been
 open.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 more
 even
 more
 than
 that,
 like
 I


didn't
 get
 to
 connect
 with
 a
 lot
 of


people
 on
 a
 on
 a
 human.


>> Yeah.
 On
 a
 human
 level.
 I
 didn't
 get
 to


shake
 the
 hands
 and
 kiss
 the
 babies
 and


like
 see
 the
 people
 that
 were
 actually


impacted
 and
 like
 appreciate
 my
 music.


>> So,
 it's
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 we
 started


doing
 meetups
 this
 year,
 as
 I
 was


telling
 you,
 like
 just
 to
 like,
 you


know,
 be
 in
 front
 of
 people
 and
 see
 what


impact
 the
 content's
 having.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it's
 it
 it's
 it
 one
 person


sharing
 a
 story
 about
 how
 my
 song
 helped


them
 get
 over
 a
 breakup
 or
 kept
 them


going
 during
 the
 pandemic
 or
 whatever
 it


was.
 That's
 worth
 a
 billion
 streams


alone
 to
 me.
 like
 how
 it
 makes
 me
 feel.


>> Right.


>> Right.


>> So,
 in
 touring,
 I've
 done
 a
 lot
 of


festivals,
 those
 print,
 private
 shows,


print,
 but
 the
 actual
 tour
 like
 of,
 you


know,
 when
 you're
 doing
 I
 think
 it's


like
 maybe
 like
 sub
 5,000
 cap
 venues.


>> Yeah.


>> You're
 probably
 gonna
 depending
 on
 the


level
 of
 production,
 you're
 probably


going
 to
 break
 even
 or
 even
 lose
 some


money.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 that's
 just
 because,
 you
 know,
 you


have
 to
 carry
 a
 band
 with
 you
 and


>> security.


>> Security.
 You
 have
 to
 pay
 all
 these


expenses
 and
 then
 you
 also
 have
 to
 pay


your
 business
 manager,
 your
 lawyer,
 your


agent,
 your
 manager.


>> And
 um


>> so
 the
 real
 money
 comes
 from
 like


selling
 out
 Madison
 Square
 Garden.


>> The
 real
 money
 come
 Yeah.
 That's
 the


Taylor
 Swift
 [ __ ]
 Like
 if
 you're
 doing


arenas
 or
 stadiums
 or
 even
 amphithetas,


you're
 going
 to
 make
 a
 good
 amount
 of


money.
 Also
 merch.
 People
 buy
 merch
 more


at
 shows
 than
 they
 do
 online.
 So
 you


sell
 a
 thousand
 hoodies
 for
 30,000
 for


$30,
 that's
 extra
 30
 grand
 in
 your


pocket,


>> right?
 But
 the
 festivals
 are
 really
 good


to
 me.
 And
 then
 with
 my
 publishing
 deal,


because
 music
 is
 monetized
 on
 two


different
 layers.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 I'
 I
 get
 royalties
 from
 that
 like


twice
 a
 year
 or
 something
 like
 that.


>> And
 you're
 Okay.
 So,
 do
 you
 own
 your


masters
 for
 the
 music
 or
 the
 label
 still


owns
 it?


>> So,
 I
 own
 my
 masters,
 but
 they
 have
 a


license
 to
 exploit
 them
 for
 x
 amount
 of


years
 and
 then
 they'll
 get
 reverted
 back


to
 me.


>> And
 and
 that's
 what
 we've
 seen
 deals


with.
 Like
 Justin
 Bieber
 sold
 his
 uh


catalog
 for
 200
 million.
 future
 sold
 for


80
 million.
 So
 one
 day
 in
 the
 future,


you
 think
 you'll
 be
 able
 to
 get
 that


exit
 essentially
 like
 a
 startup
 has
 an


exit.


>> I
 could
 sell
 it
 now
 because
 I
 own
 a


portion
 of
 it.
 Like
 I
 my
 royalty
 or


whatever
 is
 like
 I
 could
 sell
 that


revenue
 stream,


>> right?


>> Um
 I
 could
 sell
 my
 publishing,
 but
 like


I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 it's
 and
 I
 I've
 I've


gone
 back
 and
 forth
 on
 this.
 Like
 let's


say
 I
 think
 someone
 offered
 like
 10


million
 or
 something
 like
 that,
 right?


is
 is
 that
 if
 I
 got
 that
 money,
 I
 could


invest
 it
 and
 probably
 see
 greater


returns,
 but
 there
 is
 something
 about


like
 the
 safety
 of
 having
 this.


>> It's
 like
 your
 actual
 house.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Coming
 in
 every
 year
 and


like,
 okay,
 I
 know
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 have


to


>> have
 to
 liquidate
 a
 position
 or
 like


worry
 about
 bills
 or
 something
 like


that.


>> Someone
 was
 asking
 that,
 do
 you
 do
 you


take
 profits
 on
 these
 stocks
 or
 do
 you


kind
 of
 just
 like


>> with
 with
 the
 some
 of
 them?
 Yeah.
 Like
 I


took
 profits
 on
 Oakllo.
 I've
 taken


profits
 on
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 Palunteer.
 Um


I
 can
 actually
 I
 think
 I


>> because
 because
 when
 you've
 got
 money


coming
 in
 and
 you're
 not
 using
 the


portfolio
 to
 pay
 your
 bills.
 Yeah.


>> It's
 easier
 to
 just
 buy
 it
 and
 like
 not


>> forget.
 Yeah.
 Right.


>> Sit
 and
 forget.
 Let's
 see
 what
 do
 I


have.


>> So
 like
 I've
 Can
 I
 see
 of
 all
 time?
 All


time
 I've
 only
 taken
 $21,000
 of
 profits.


Wow.
 And
 this
 was
 just
 taking
 money
 off


the
 table
 of
 things
 that
 I
 thought
 were


like
 a
 little
 overhyped
 or
 overvalued.


Like
 my
 DraftKings
 I
 sold
 that
 cuz
 I'm


like
 Yeah.
 Couchy
 Robin
 Hood.


>> We'll
 talk
 about
 that.


>> They're
 gonna
 eat
 everybody.
 And
 then
 I


sell
 losers
 to
 like
 uh
 Offset
 Tax
 Stuff.


Y


>> what
 else
 did
 I
 sell?


>> Like
 Oaklo,
 bro.
 I
 I
 22xed
 on
 this.
 So


I'm
 like,
 "Yeah,
 I'll
 take
 some
 profits


off
 the
 table.
 Why
 the
 [ __ ]
 not?"


>> Um
 yeah.


>> No,
 it
 makes
 sense.
 If
 you've
 got
 money


coming
 in,
 then
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 stress


too
 much
 about
 it.
 So,
 okay.
 So
 then,
 um


let's
 talk
 about
 this
 one
 because
 you


got
 a
 lot
 of
 questions
 in
 the
 chat
 about


this


>> about
 what


>> um


>> Bitcoin


>> crypto.
 How
 big
 are
 you,


>> bro?


>> into
 BTC.


>> I
 was
 buying
 Bitcoin
 in
 2015
 and
 2016.


>> Of
 course
 you
 were.
 Of
 course
 you
 were.


>> And
 but
 but
 I
 was
 I
 was
 a
 minor
 and
 this


was
 like
 this
 was
 pre
 It
 might
 even
 been


a
 little
 earlier
 than
 that,
 but
 this
 was


pre-
 like
 KYC.
 So
 when
 the
 government


had
 made
 all
 these
 like
 know
 your


customer
 regulations,
 they
 were
 like,


"Yo,
 uh,
 we
 actually
 ran
 your
 name
 and


everything
 and
 you're
 not
 allowed
 to


>> you
 can't
 trade
 crypto."
 So
 they


liquidated
 all
 my
 stuff.


>> What
 was
 it
 on?
 It
 was
 on
 like
 one
 of


>> It
 was
 on
 like like
 Bitrex
 or
 some
 [ __ ]


like
 that.
 Like
 some
 early
 random


exchange
 that
 nobody
 cares
 about


anymore.


Um,
 and
 it
 wasn't
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 money,


but
 I
 think
 I
 probably
 had
 like
 0.1


because
 I
 remember
 Bitcoin
 was
 like
 a


thousand
 or
 2,000.
 I
 had
 like
 0.1.


>> Yeah.
 Which
 would
 be
 10
 grand
 now,
 which


is,


>> hey,
 it's
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 change
 my


life
 necessarily,
 but


>> it
 would
 have
 been
 [ __ ]
 nice,
 you


know?


>> Um,
 but
 I've
 boughten
 a
 lot
 of
 Bitcoin.


I
 buy
 $50
 of
 Bitcoin
 every
 single
 day


and
 I've
 bought
 in
 a
 bunch
 uh
 this
 year


actually
 I've
 probably
 spent
 the
 most
 on


Bitcoin
 than
 I
 have.


>> You
 believe
 in
 Bitcoin
 as
 a
 thesis?


>> I
 think
 so.
 Yeah.
 I'm
 I'm
 curious
 as
 to


like
 what
 this
 quantum
 situation
 is


going
 to
 do
 with
 everything.
 But
 it's
 my


understanding
 that
 if
 enough
 of
 the


holders
 like
 there
 there
 can
 be
 some


merge
 or
 some


way
 to
 bypass
 it.
 Honestly,
 I
 have
 no


idea.
 I
 don't
 know if
 Quantum's
 gonna


[ __ ]


>> If
 you
 know
 in
 the
 chat,
 if
 you're


smarter
 than
 us,
 tell
 us,
 please.
 Um,


but
 yeah,
 Bitcoin,
 Ethereum.
 I
 bought
 a


bunch
 of
 Zcash
 because
 I
 saw
 Naval
 tweet


about
 it
 at
 like
 111
 bucks
 and
 I
 sold


some
 uh
 No,
 did
 I
 sell
 any?


>> Zcash
 is
 something
 I
 haven't
 looked


into,
 but
 uh
 I've
 it's
 gone
 pretty
 viral


this
 year.


>> The
 narrative
 is
 basically
 like
 Bitcoin


but
 private.


>> But
 private,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Which
 is
 like
 kind
 of
 antithetical
 to


the
 public
 ledger


>> of
 the
 blockchain.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.


>> But
 I
 don't
 know.
 You
 got
 all
 these


crypto
 scammers
 that
 got
 to
 launder


their
 money
 somehow.


So
 whatever.
 But
 even
 I
 saw
 it
 go
 up
 to


700.
 I
 thought
 about
 selling
 it.
 I


didn't.
 Uh
 and
 then
 it's
 at
 sitting


around
 like
 380
 or
 360
 right
 now.
 So
 I'm


I
 tripled
 up
 already.
 So
 I'll
 kind
 of


just
 let
 that
 one
 ride.
 The
 worst
 one


though
 is
 Dogecoin.


I
 put
 a
 $200
 into
 Dogecoin
 or
 some


nominal
 amount
 of
 money
 um
 at
 like
 a


fraction
 of
 a
 fraction
 of
 a
 fraction
 of


a
 fraction
 of
 a
 cent.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 sold
 it
 one
 day
 just
 cuz
 I
 was


bored.
 Like
 I
 was
 just
 like,
 "Oh,


whatever.
 [ __ ]
 this.
 If
 I
 had
 kept
 that,


I
 would
 have
 had
 made
 250K
 at
 its
 peak.


That
 is
 one
 of
 my
 like
 that
 is
 why
 I


have
 100
 tickers
 because
 I
 don't
 want
 to


experience
 that
 again.


>> I
 remember
 May
 of
 2021.
 That's
 when
 Elon


went
 on
 SNL
 and
 uh
 Yeah.


>> Well,
 that
 was
 when
 it
 dumped.
 Yeah.


After
 you
 went


>> right
 when
 it
 Yeah.


>> What
 about
 ETH?
 Do
 you
 do


>> I
 have
 ETH?
 I
 mean,
 that's
 been
 the
 most


stagnant
 [ __ ]
 thing
 in
 my
 entire


crypto
 portfolio.


>> Yeah.


>> Like,
 I
 just
 finally
 got
 profitable


again.
 I
 think
 this
 year
 um
 when
 it
 went


past
 like
 2200
 or
 something
 like
 that.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 I'm
 just
 like,
 yo,


move
 like
 do
 something.
 You
 know,


>> it
 really
 has
 been
 stuck.
 I
 think
 people


are
 so
 excited
 about
 BMR
 because
 they're


like,
 Tom
 Lee
 is
 gonna
 actually
 get
 the


world
 to
 care.
 But


>> yeah,


>> we
 got
 to
 see.
 I
 I
 think
 it's
 like


definitely
 the
 most
 versatile
 in
 terms


of
 like
 use
 case.


>> Um
 I
 just
 don't
 think
 that
 the
 you
 the


things
 that
 can
 be
 built
 upon
 it
 have


achieved
 like
 peak
 popularity
 or
 peak


awareness
 or
 utility
 yet.
 So
 until
 that


happens,
 it's
 kind
 of
 just
 going
 to


follow
 Bitcoin
 very
 very
 very
 slowly.


>> Okay,
 I
 have
 a
 couple
 more
 questions,


but
 guys,
 if
 you
 have
 any
 specific


questions
 in
 the
 chat
 about
 music,
 his


life,
 stock
 market,
 you
 put
 in
 the
 chat


and
 we'll
 get
 into
 them.
 I
 want
 to
 ask


you
 this
 one.
 Yeah.


>> Prediction
 markets.
 How
 big
 of
 an


industry
 do
 you
 think
 this
 gonna
 become?


>> I
 think
 it's
 gonna
 be
 huge.
 I
 I
 bought


DraftKings
 because
 I
 had
 a
 sense
 that


gambling
 was
 the
 future
 of
 America.


>> Why?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 there's
 so
 many
 people
 um


our
 age
 and
 younger
 that
 feel
 stuck.


>> Financial
 nihilism.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 that
 thesis
 is
 becoming
 a
 it's


becoming
 a
 big
 thing
 where
 people
 in


their
 20s
 are
 feeling
 the
 system
 broke


them
 and
 they're
 just
 yoloing
 it
 in


>> because
 that's


>> and it's
 a
 sad
 story
 but
 nonetheless


it's
 happening


>> and
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 the
 only
 way
 a


lot
 of
 people
 feel
 like
 they
 actually


have
 a
 chance
 of
 having
 a
 windfall
 you


know
 like
 you
 got
 these
 boomers
 spending


their
 these
 kids
 inheritance
 on
 [ __ ]


world
 cruises
 and
 [ __ ]
 they're
 not
 going


to
 have
 anything


>> left
 when
 they're
 done


>> and
 um
 like
 even
 just
 with
 my
 friends
 of


sports
 betting
 and
 how
 into
 it
 people


get.
 If
 you
 can
 bet
 on
 when
 is
 an
 album


come
 out,
 is
 bro
 gonna
 is
 is
 are
 am
 I


going
 to
 say
 Bitcoin
 on
 this
 uh
 stream?


Like
 it's
 it's
 entertainment
 and
 the
 the


possibility
 of
 financial
 freedom
 all


baked
 into
 one.


>> Um


>> and
 and
 it
 and
 it's
 allowing
 you
 to


trade
 a
 difference
 in
 any
 opinion
 that


exists,
 which
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 think
 is


like
 dystopian,


>> which
 I
 understand
 that
 perspective.
 The


other
 perspective
 is
 just
 like,
 well,
 if


there's
 a
 market
 for
 it,
 like,
 should
 we


be
 able
 to
 trade
 penny
 stocks?
 Should
 we


be
 able
 to
 trade
 futures
 on
 soybeans?


Well,
 there's
 a
 market
 for
 it.


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 how
 are
 you
 going
 to
 hate
 that


there's
 a
 market?
 There's
 a
 buyer
 and
 a


seller,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 it's
 like
 if
 you


and
 me
 were
 were
 [ __ ]
 walking
 down


the
 street
 and
 we
 saw
 a
 guy
 on
 his
 phone


and
 there's
 a
 a
 big
 ass
 puddle
 in
 front


of
 him
 and
 I'm
 like,
 "Yo,
 I'll
 bet
 you


five
 bucks
 that
 he's
 going
 to
 step
 in


it."
 And
 you're
 like, "Nah,
 he's
 not


going
 to
 step
 in
 it."
 That's
 essentially


what
 that
 is.
 just


>> and
 your
 edge
 is
 that
 you
 see
 the
 puddle


before
 me.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um
 I
 do
 think
 it
 it's
 a


little
 tricky
 with
 like
 insider


>> Yeah.


>> information
 just
 in
 the
 way
 that
 it's


regulated
 differently.


>> Um
 I
 don't
 know
 the
 answer
 or
 the


solution
 or


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 tricky.


>> Vlad
 was
 on
 a
 podcast
 recently
 and


someone
 was
 talking
 about
 sports
 betting


and
 he
 was
 like
 instead
 of
 paying
 $374


to
 make
 $100
 on
 DraftKings,
 I
 would


rather
 bet
 yes,
 the
 Patriots
 are
 going


to
 beat
 the
 Giants.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I'm
 gonna
 take
 that
 78
 cents


bet
 because
 if
 I
 win
 I
 get
 a
 dollar


which
 is
 a
 20%
 return.
 Yeah.


>> Like
 psychologically
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 realizing
 no
 I'm
 not
 gonna
 go


through
 DraftKings
 and
 bet
 the
 over
 and


under
 where
 the
 house
 already
 has
 their


built-in
 VIG.
 There's
 no
 vague
 in
 the


prediction
 market.
 No.
 Someone
 thinks


it's
 20
 cents.
 You
 think
 it's
 80
 cents


and
 you
 think
 the
 Patriots
 are


definitely
 going
 to
 be
 the
 Giants
 which


they
 destroyed
 the
 Giants.
 Boom.
 That's


a
 20%
 return
 for
 doing
 that.


>> Poly
 market
 makes
 no
 money,
 right?


>> Poly
 market
 doesn't
 make
 any
 fees.
 They


and
 they
 have


>> ads
 or
 whatever
 or
 what?


>> So
 Shane
 said
 they
 don't
 make
 money.
 I'm


pretty
 sure
 they're
 going to
 come
 out


with
 a
 coin


>> and
 the
 coin
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 like


the
 value
 exchange
 but
 unlike
 Robin
 and


Ki
 they
 don't
 take
 a
 fee
 which
 is
 why


they
 have
 the
 biggest
 market
 share
 of


the
 entire


>> So
 wait
 let
 so
 if
 they
 make
 a
 coin
 right


then
 the
 coin
 will
 fluctuate
 in
 value
 or


what


>> yeah
 I
 mean
 like
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 called


this
 might
 be me
 guessing
 the
 polycoin


>> imagine
 p
 o
 l
 y
 and
 I
 think
 people
 will


literally
 buy
 it
 if
 they
 think
 their


prediction
 market
 is
 growing
 bigger
 than


the
 others
 now
 maybe
 they'll
 eventually


introduce
 fees
 but
 right
 now
 people
 love


poly
 market
 because
 first
 of
 all
 crypto.


So,
 it's
 not
 as
 regulated
 as
 uh
 the
 CFTC


contracts
 on
 Kian
 Hood.
 And
 second
 of


all,
 they
 don't
 they
 don't
 charge
 a
 fee.


Like
 the
 fees
 hurt
 because
 when
 you
 pay


two
 cents
 a
 contract,
 like
 it's
 two


cents
 into
 your
 margin,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> So,
 that's
 how
 I
 think
 Poly
 Market's


going
 to
 gonna
 monetize
 it.
 But
 the


point
 is
 the
 industry
 is
 growing


massively
 and


>> and
 like
 that.
 So,
 that
 was
 my
 thesis
 on


DraftKings
 and
 Poly
 Market
 just
 and
 Ky


and
 these
 prediction
 markets,
 they
 just


made
 it
 better
 and
 more
 efficient
 and


more
 expansive.
 And
 I
 also
 don't
 [ __ ]


with
 the
 fact
 that
 these
 sports
 books


can
 like
 cut
 you
 off
 if
 you
 win
 too


much.


>> Yep.


>> Like
 nah,
 he's
 winning
 too
 much.
 We
 got


to
 get
 this
 guy
 out
 of
 here.
 Like
 that


doesn't
 seem
 in
 the
 spirit
 of
 what


gambling
 or


>> is
 supposed
 to
 be,
 I
 guess.
 You
 know.


>> Yes,
 I
 agree.
 Like
 because
 if
 you're


beating
 the
 house
 and
 then
 the
 house


gets
 rid
 of
 you,
 that's
 the
 number
 one


reason
 I
 think
 prediction
 markets
 are


better.
 Robin's
 not
 going
 to
 get
 they


don't
 have
 incentive
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 you


if
 you're
 winning.


>> Yeah.


>> They
 just
 collect
 a
 fee.
 They
 don't
 care


if
 you
 keep
 Okay,
 you're
 winning.
 Great.


But
 DraftKings,
 like
 even
 on
 their
 Q3
 uh


earnings,


>> I'm
 gonna
 sell
 all
 my
 DraftKings
 right


now.
 [ __ ]
 this.
 Put
 the
 order
 in.


>> Dude,
 on
 their
 Q3
 earnings,
 I
 couldn't


believe
 this
 [ __ ]
 The
 the
 CEO
 Jason
 was


like,
 uh,
 he
 said
 it
 in
 a
 very
 like


intellectual
 way,
 but
 basically
 it
 came


down
 to
 our
 customers
 won
 too
 much
 last


quarter.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 and
 then
 I'm
 listening
 to
 this
 like,


so
 he's
 basically
 saying
 our
 business


model
 collapses
 if
 our
 customers
 win,


>> which
 is
 like,


okay,
 so
 yeah,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 [ __ ]
 with


that.
 I'm
 the
 [ __ ]


>> trade
 options.


>> No,
 don't
 trade
 options.
 Um,


it
 just
 seems
 too
 complicated
 and
 time


inensive
 and
 like


I
 don't
 the
 the
 risk
 to
 reward
 is
 like


>> Yeah.
 Especially
 very
 high.
 Yeah.
 And


that's
 like
 legit
 gambling
 to
 be
 honest.


>> Yeah.
 I've
 seen
 people
 make
 millions
 on


Wall
 Street
 bets
 and
 I've
 seen
 them
 lose


millions
 on
 Wall
 Street
 bets.
 And
 I'm


like,
 okay,
 I'd
 rather
 just
 buy


companies
 that
 I
 believe
 in.
 All
 98
 of


them,


>> under
 98
 of
 them.
 Um,
 what's
 the
 largest


crowd
 you
 ever
 played
 in
 front
 of?


>> 80,000
 people.


>> Where?


>> Uh,
 Outside
 Lands
 Festival.


>> Wow.


>> I
 was
 a
 headliner
 there
 in
 2022,
 I


think.
 And
 I
 remember
 standing
 on
 that


stage
 and
 looking
 out
 into
 the
 crowd.


And
 this
 is,
 keep
 in
 mind,
 I
 grew
 up
 in


San
 Francisco.
 This
 is
 the
 festival
 that


I
 snuck
 into
 dressed
 as
 a
 [ __ ]


construction
 worker
 as
 in
 high
 school.


And
 a
 couple
 years
 later,
 I'm
 on
 that


stage
 performing.
 And
 looking
 out
 into


the
 crowd,


>> oh
 man,


>> I've
 never
 seen
 that
 many
 people
 in
 my


[ __ ]
 life.
 Like,
 it
 just
 went
 back


endlessly
 and
 endlessly
 and
 endlessly.


It
 was


>> How
 old
 were
 you?


>> I
 was
 maybe
 21
 or
 22.


Dude,
 that's
 got
 to
 be
 like
 because
 the


story
 you
 described
 about
 sending
 the


emails
 to
 the
 the
 the
 blogger
 for


Soundcloud.
 Like
 a
 lot
 of
 kids
 don't


have
 that
 hustle.
 No.
 At
 that
 age,


>> like
 a
 lot
 of
 kids
 don't
 to
 have
 that


hustle
 to
 like
 do
 what
 you
 did,
 not


knowing
 if
 it
 was
 going
 to
 work.
 For


from
 my
 side,
 it
 was
 like
 really
 bullish


pounder,
 made
 many
 videos
 every
 single


day.
 For
 two
 years,
 the
 stock
 was
 stuck.


But
 like
 you
 just
 you
 kept
 going
 and


eventually,
 you
 know,
 you
 took
 the
 risk


and
 maybe
 something
 happens.
 Um,
 where


do
 you
 think
 that
 hustle
 came
 from?


So,
 I
 I
 think
 it
 came
 from
 from
 where
 I


grew
 up,
 you
 know,
 like
 San
 Francisco,


as
 we
 talked
 about
 a
 little
 bit,
 is
 this


there's
 there's
 rich
 and
 there's


wealthy,
 generationally


wealthy.


>> And
 San
 Francisco
 has
 the
 poorest
 of
 the


poor
 and
 the
 richest
 of
 the
 rich.


>> And


my
 um
 I'll
 tell
 you
 a
 little
 about
 about


this
 before.
 my
 my
 childhood
 best


friends,
 my
 first
 friends
 um
 are
 twins


and
 their
 dad
 is
 Dan
 Niles,


>> which
 is
 crazy,
 bro.


>> So,
 one
 of
 his


>> like
 my
 god
 Dan
 is
 like
 my
 godfather.


>> His
 godfather
 is


>> Uncle
 Dan.
 Yeah.


>> His
 uncle
 Dan
 Niles
 who
 is
 a
 little


bearish
 sometimes
 when
 we
 see
 him
 on


CNBC,
 which
 is
 hilarious.
 But
 um
 we
 we


the
 beautiful
 thing
 about
 about
 that
 is


that
 people
 can
 connect
 across


socioeconomic
 classes
 in
 a
 way
 that
 you


might
 not
 get
 in
 the
 suburbs
 where


everyone's
 making
 about
 the
 same
 money


or
 whatever.
 And
 growing
 up
 I
 remember


we
 would
 go
 to
 their
 house
 and
 they
 had


a
 massive
 playroom.
 They
 had
 a
 wooden


pirate
 ship
 in
 the
 backyard
 and
 I
 loved


going
 to
 their
 house
 and
 I
 loved
 hanging


out
 with
 them
 and
 like
 it
 wasn't
 what
 I


had
 and
 I
 was
 happy
 with
 what
 I
 had
 and


like
 grateful
 for
 what
 I
 had
 but
 it
 you


can
 only
 want
 what
 you
 can
 what
 you
 see


you
 know
 and
 what
 you
 understand


>> and
 once
 I
 was
 old
 enough
 to
 like
 ask


like
 wait
 so
 why
 is
 why
 why
 is
 your
 crib


so
 fat?
 Yeah.


>> And
 he
 was
 like
 oh
 I'm
 in
 finance
 I'm
 a


hedge
 manager
 fund
 manager
 d


>> I
 said
 okay
 well
 that's
 what
 I
 want
 to


do.
 So
 my
 whole
 plan
 before
 music
 was
 to


get
 into
 finance.
 Like


>> money
 was
 motivation.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 did
 genuinely
 have
 an


interest
 in
 business
 and
 investing
 and


like
 being
 able
 to


I
 don't
 know
 kind
 of
 put
 your
 money


where
 your
 mouth
 is.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 like
 notice
 things
 and
 observe


things
 before
 other
 people
 and
 see
 the


value
 in
 things
 before
 everyone
 does


which
 has
 carried
 over
 a
 lot
 in
 the


music
 as
 well
 too.
 Um,
 but
 that
 was
 I


forget
 what
 the
 initial
 question
 was


>> just
 like
 what
 motivated
 you
 to
 grind
 as


hard
 as
 you
 did.


>> So,
 so
 seeing
 that
 put
 this
 battery
 in


my
 back
 of
 like
 no
 I
 gotta
 get
 this


money


>> and
 I've
 done
 I
 I
 I
 used
 to
 buy
 sneakers


on
 Facebook
 groups
 and
 refurbish
 them


and
 do
 customs
 and
 flip
 them.
 I
 used
 to


do
 Supreme.
 I
 was
 buying
 watches,
 gold


little
 like
 Casio
 knockoffs
 off
 of


AliExpress
 for
 $2
 each.
 and
 selling
 them


for
 $10
 to
 $20
 each
 at
 these
 sneaker


conventions.
 Like
 I
 was
 always
 going
 to


find
 a
 way
 to
 make
 money
 and
 I
 just
 so


happened
 that
 music
 intersected
 with


that
 and
 I
 was
 lucky
 enough
 and


you
 know
 talented
 enough
 to
 be
 able
 to


do
 make
 money
 doing
 something
 I
 really


really
 love
 like
 that.


>> It's
 exciting
 dude.
 I
 mean
 to
 to
 be
 this


young
 in
 the
 industry
 to
 get
 that
 number


one
 hit
 and
 then
 to
 you
 know
 turn
 it


into
 an
 investment
 portfolio.
 How
 are


you
 thinking
 of
 startups?
 Do
 do
 you
 want


to
 invest
 in
 like
 the
 next
 open
 AAI?


>> So
 I
 have
 I
 mean
 most
 of
 my
 uh
 angel


checks
 have
 been
 in
 consumerf
 facing


products
 because
 that's
 where
 I
 can
 be
 a


value
 at.


>> Yep.


>> Um
 but
 I
 I
 had
 my
 first
 exit
 uh
 this


year
 actually
 with
 Poppy.


>> Oh
 that
 was
 the
 it's
 a
 crypto.


>> No
 no
 soda.


>> Oh
 the
 soda.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Yeah
 I


know
 them.


>> So


>> was
 that
 was
 that
 a
 good
 exit?


>> Bro
 I
 I
 83xed.


>> Goodness
 dude.
 my
 first
 my
 first


investment
 ever
 and
 I
 83xed.
 Oh,
 this
 is


an
 interesting
 website.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 uh
 I
 put
 some
 money
 in
 and
 then
 I
 I


did
 some
 deliverables
 to
 get
 like


advisor
 shares


>> and
 that
 was
 [ __ ]
 sick.
 And
 like


Allison
 is
 amazing.
 Her
 husband
 is
 Yeah.


So
 she's
 her
 and
 her
 husband
 founded
 it


>> and
 uh
 yeah,
 they
 got
 acquired
 for
 $2


billion
 by
 Pepsi.
 When
 I
 invested
 it
 was


like
 24
 million
 or
 some
 [ __ ]
 like
 that.


>> Goodness,
 bro.
 Yeah,
 Pepsi
 bought
 them.


>> Um,
 so
 that
 was
 a
 great
 one
 for
 me.
 I'm


also
 in
 Starface,
 which
 do
 those
 pimple


patches
 with
 the
 stars.


>> Okay.


>> You
 might
 seen
 like
 Central
 C
 wears
 them


all
 the
 time.
 A
 lot
 of
 selection.


>> Oh,
 yes.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 I'm
 in
 Moon
 Pay.


>> That's
 a
 crypto
 one.


>> That's
 a
 crypto
 one.


>> That's
 a
 crypto
 one.
 Yeah.


>> Um,
 what
 else
 am
 I
 in?


>> And
 how
 how
 do
 you
 get
 these?
 Do
 people


just
 hit
 you
 up?
 So
 my
 manager
 at
 the


time
 u
 one
 of
 my
 managers
 at
 the
 time
 he


was
 doing
 he
 had
 this
 idea
 of
 like
 yo
 I


have
 these
 artists
 that
 have
 cultural


capital
 and
 I
 can
 get
 them
 into
 competit


I
 can
 I
 can
 get
 allocations
 for


competitive
 deals
 by
 leveraging
 the


artists
 and
 then
 I'm
 going
 to
 break
 the


artist
 off
 and
 let
 them
 get
 into
 it
 and


get
 advisor
 shares
 and
 everything.


Right.


>> So
 he
 was
 bringing
 in
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff.


>> Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 what
 else
 did
 I
 have?
 Um,
 I


did
 like
 Hero
 Brad
 like
 Tom
 Brady


invested
 in
 that
 one.


>> He's
 become
 an
 icon
 with
 his


investments.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know,


>> but
 I'm
 I'm
 always
 looking
 for
 deal.
 I


think
 I
 sent
 you
 a
 DM
 about
 that
 a
 while


ago.


>> Well,
 now
 I
 have
 my
 A16Z
 thing.
 So,
 if
 I


find
 a
 good
 deal,
 then
 I
 will
 definitely


send
 it
 your
 way.


>> Yeah.
 Holl
 at
 your
 boy.


>> It's
 hard
 to
 find
 them
 early
 though.


Yeah.
 It's
 really
 hard.
 But
 if
 you
 do


like
 83x
 that
 you
 don't
 get
 that
 in
 the


stock
 market.


>> No.


>> Unless
 you
 invest
 and
 literally
 wait
 for


1015
 years
 and
 maybe
 if
 you
 have
 Nvidia,


you
 know,
 it
 works
 out.


>> Yeah.
 But
 yeah,
 that
 that
 kind
 of
 return


is
 like
 crazy.
 That
 paid
 for
 any
 other


investment
 that
 I've
 ever
 done.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then


>> so
 and
 then
 a
 lot
 more.
 So
 that
 was


really
 cool.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 I'm
 always


open
 and
 always
 looking
 and
 listening.


>> Have
 you
 had
 any
 relationships
 go
 bad


with
 people
 that
 manage
 you?
 Like


they're
 taking
 money
 under
 the
 table
 or


they're
 screwing
 you?
 Like
 there
 been


any
 of
 that
 in
 your
 life?


>> Just
 one
 person
 in
 particular
 I
 can


think
 of.
 Um


>> cuz
 that
 [ __ ]
 happens,
 right?


>> Totally.
 Totally.
 But
 it
 it
 it
 wasn't
 it


it
 I
 didn't
 get
 hit
 like
 some
 of
 the


horror
 stories
 you
 hear
 where
 someone


wakes
 up
 and
 their
 entire
 bank
 account


is
 missing.
 Yeah.
 I've
 been
 very


fortunate
 to
 work
 with
 great
 people.


>> Um
 it
 was
 just
 somebody
 that
 was
 like


>> just
 telling
 me
 things
 cost
 more
 than


they
 did.
 Yeah.


>> And
 I
 would
 pay
 them
 directly
 to


reimburse
 them
 for
 certain
 things.


>> Yeah.
 And
 then
 I
 I
 just
 had
 this
 feeling


and
 there
 was
 like
 it
 was
 it
 was
 just


there
 was
 some
 shady
 [ __ ]
 happening
 and


when
 I
 was
 like
 all
 right
 well
 show
 me


how
 much
 that
 you
 pay
 for
 that.


>> Then
 I
 oh
 you
 know
 I
 got
 this
 so
 story


of
 I
 don't
 know
 my
 password.
 I
 got


locked
 out
 of
 my
 account
 and
 I'm
 like
 yo


you're
 full
 of
 [ __ ]


>> Uh
 as
 an
 artist
 how
 much
 do
 you


financially
 plan
 based
 on
 future


grossing
 music
 revenue
 versus
 Okay.
 So,


do
 you
 think
 about
 your
 investments
 as


your
 source
 of
 like
 future
 revenue
 or


you
 kind
 of
 think
 of
 the
 the


appreciating
 asset
 that
 is
 your
 catalog?


>> Um,


that's
 a
 great
 question.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 My
 philosophy
 is
 like


invest
 as
 much
 money
 as
 I
 can
 and
 still


like
 while
 still
 being
 able
 to
 like
 have


a
 lifestyle
 that
 is
 comfortable
 but
 not


excessive.


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 everyone's
 definition
 of
 excessive


is
 different.
 Um,
 but
 like
 I
 don't
 I


don't
 have
 six
 Lamborghinis.
 I
 don't
 I'm


not
 flying
 girls
 out
 first
 class
 [ __ ]


to
 Monaco
 and
 staying
 in
 the
 nicest


hotel
 like


>> But
 you
 have
 flown
 girls
 out
 before


>> it's
 just
 not
 first
 class
 to
 Monaco.


It's
 not
 breakable
 yet.


>> No,
 not
 yet.
 But
 like
 I
 I
 grew
 up
 with


so
 much
 less
 than
 what
 I
 have
 now.


>> And
 I've
 tasted
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 highest


upper
 echelons
 of
 things.
 Yeah.
 And
 a


lot
 of
 it
 isn't
 worth
 it.
 You
 know,
 a


lot
 of
 it
 is
 just
 people
 that
 don't
 they


have
 too
 much
 money.
 They
 don't
 know


what
 to
 do
 with
 it
 or
 it's
 a
 dick


swinging
 contest.


>> And
 I
 know
 where
 I'm
 hanging.
 I
 don't


got
 to
 swing
 nothing
 for
 y'all.
 Like


we're
 good.
 You
 know,
 I
 like
 my
 watches.


I
 like
 my
 specific
 niche
 cars
 that


aren't
 $500,000.


>> What
 What
 are
 your
 cars?
 So
 right
 now
 I


have
 uh
 uh
 G63
 a
 G
 Wagon.


>> Okay.


>> Um
 which
 was
 a
 tax
 write
 off
 because
 of


of
 the
 video.


>> No
 no
 wait
 thing.


>> Ah
 right.
 There's
 a
 law
 about
 that.


Yeah.


>> I
 I
 don't
 do
 there's
 some
 gray
 areas
 and


then
 there's
 some
 gray
 areas
 and
 like


when
 people
 buy
 a
 nice
 car
 and
 then
 they


put
 their
 like
 brand
 sticker
 on
 it
 and


write
 it
 off.
 I'm
 like


>> okay
 you
 might
 get
 away
 with
 it
 but
 it's


not
 worth
 the
 risk
 to
 me.


>> Risk.
 Right.


>> No.
 I've
 I've
 read
 too
 much
 about
 Wesley


Snipes.
 I
 want
 no
 smoke
 with
 IRS.


Um,
 so
 I
 have
 a
 G
 Wagon,
 which
 is
 like


my
 daily,
 and
 then
 I
 bought
 a
 E36
 M3


>> uh
 with
 the
 Dining
 Supercharger,
 and


that
 was
 a
 car
 that
 I
 learned
 how
 to


drive
 stick
 on.
 And
 then
 just
 a
 couple


weeks
 ago,
 I
 bought
 a
 Acura
 NSX
 uh
 from


98.


>> 1998.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 you
 like
 the
 classic
 type
 of


>> I
 like
 80s
 and
 90s
 cars.
 Yeah.


>> No
 Teslas,
 you
 know,
 like
 Cybert
 truck.


>> No,
 I
 don't
 really
 like
 the
 I
 go
 back


and
 forth
 on
 the
 Cybert
 truck.
 Sometimes


I
 look
 at
 it
 and
 I'm
 like,
 damn,
 that


shit's
 fire.
 And
 then
 sometimes
 I
 look


at
 it,
 I'm
 like,
 I
 don't
 know.
 But
 I


would
 a
 thousand%
 buy
 the
 robo
 taxi
 when


it
 comes
 out.
 I
 would
 buy
 four
 of
 them


>> when
 it
 Okay.
 So
 when
 the
 with
 the
 cyber


cab
 when
 it
 can
 like
 drive
 people
 around


and
 when
 you
 can
 like
 have
 your
 own


little
 fleet
 and
 just
 have
 it.


>> So
 you
 like
 that
 idea
 of
 like
 being
 a


fleet
 manager
 and
 letting
 the
 cars
 just


go
 make
 you
 money?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah,
 I
 do
 like
 that.
 And
 for
 if
 they


actually
 are
 $20,000
 a
 pop,
 that's


that's
 a
 good
 deal.
 And
 then
 I
 could


just
 have
 one
 for
 my
 personal
 use,
 too.


>> Yeah,
 people
 love
 this.


>> Yeah,
 the
 NS.
 It's
 that's
 like
 a
 if
 you


know,
 you
 know
 car.
 It's
 It's
 so
 funny


because
 sometimes
 girls
 will
 be
 like,


"Oh,
 what
 car
 do
 you
 have?"
 I'm
 like,


"Oh,
 I
 have
 a
 Honda."
 And
 I
 see
 how
 they


react.


>> Okay,
 let's
 uh
 this


>> that's
 a
 new
 one.
 I
 have
 the
 old
 one


like
 this.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 So,
 let's
 get
 into
 that


conversation.
 What
 has
 it
 been
 like
 with


uh
 the
 women
 as
 you've
 accumulated
 more


wealth?
 How
 how
 do
 you
 even
 like
 because


girls
 know
 who
 you
 are,
 right?


>> I
 mean,
 sometimes,
 bro,
 I've
 gone


through
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 hairstyles


and


>> You
 have
 You
 have


>> And
 it's
 it's
 so
 funny.
 Ever
 since
 I
 cut


my
 hair,
 like
 when
 I
 first
 cut
 my
 hair


and
 I
 went
 out
 for
 the
 first
 time,
 I
 saw


I
 would
 I
 would
 see
 people
 that
 I
 know


and
 like
 that
 I
 know
 know
 me
 and
 I
 would


just
 wait
 to
 see
 how
 long
 it
 took
 for


them
 to
 realize
 who
 I
 was
 because


they're
 so
 used
 to
 one
 Yeah.
 Look
 at
 me.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 I
 don't
 know.
 I've
 always
 been


charming
 and
 handsome,
 you
 know?
 So


>> humble


>> and
 humble.
 Extremely
 humble.


>> No,
 but
 like
 like
 like
 Okay,
 so
 let's


say
 a
 girl
 doesn't
 know
 you
 and
 then


you're
 on
 a
 date
 with
 her
 and
 then
 she


asks
 what
 do
 you
 do?
 And
 you
 end
 up


disclosing
 enough
 where
 she's
 like,
 "Oh,


he
 has
 money."
 Have
 you
 been
 in
 a


situation
 where
 you're
 fighting
 the


perception
 of
 what
 she's
 having
 versus


her
 wanting
 to
 like
 you
 for
 just
 who
 you


are?


Well,
 I'm
 very
 very very
 particular


about
 who
 I'm
 going
 to
 date,
 who's
 going


to
 be
 my
 girlfriend.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 like
 I
 there's
 a
 a
 long
 screening


process,
 I
 guess,
 because
 if
 I'm
 dating


you
 and
 you
 and
 me
 are
 girlfriend
 and


boyfriend,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 waste
 your


time
 and
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 waste
 my
 time.


I
 there
 that
 means
 I
 have
 to
 see
 a


future
 with
 you.
 You
 have
 to
 be
 my


potential
 life
 partner.
 You
 know,


>> you're
 like
 really
 serious
 when
 you're


dating.


>> We're
 dating.
 Yeah.
 Yes.
 Yes.
 And
 you


want
 to
 get
 married,
 have
 kids,
 have


that
 whole


>> I
 want
 to
 get
 married.
 I
 want
 to
 have


kids.
 I
 want
 to
 have
 grandkids.
 I
 want


to
 have
 a
 compound
 where
 we
 can
 all


>> flourish
 and
 love
 and
 all
 that
 [ __ ]


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 but
 I'm
 definitely
 not
 on
 like
 a


tight
 timeline
 for
 that.
 You
 know,
 I'm


25.
 At
 the
 youngest
 I
 would
 get
 married


is
 probably
 like
 30
 or
 32
 and
 start


having
 kids.


>> Um,


>> but
 back
 to
 your
 question
 about
 like
 the


perception.
 So,
 you're
 saying
 like
 am
 I


fighting
 their
 perception
 of
 me
 or


>> Yeah.
 Like
 how
 do
 you
 know
 she
 likes
 you


for
 you
 versus
 she
 likes
 you
 because
 she


knows
 she's
 going to
 have
 a
 really


comfortable
 life
 if
 she
 does
 end
 up


>> well
 I'm
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 the


comfortable
 life
 until
 like
 down
 the


line.
 That's
 part
 of
 the
 filtration


process.
 I'm
 not
 the
 [ __ ]
 that's
 out


here
 that's
 buying
 Birkkins.
 And
 Drake


got
 that.
 He
 got
 that
 lane
 fully


covered.
 If
 you
 want
 that,
 go
 to
 Drake.


>> Okay.
 Cuz
 I'm
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 lover
 and
 I'm


generous
 but
 I'm
 not
 a
 trick.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 like
 you
 like
 I
 pay


attention
 to
 things
 like
 have
 you
 ever


offered
 to
 cover
 dinner?
 Not
 the
 first


date,
 but
 like
 yo,
 if
 we've
 been
 seeing


each
 other
 for,
 I
 don't
 know,
 a
 couple


weeks
 or
 months
 or
 whatever,
 I've
 taken


you
 out
 to
 seven
 dinners.
 I'm
 not
 Are


you
 offering
 to
 cover
 the
 dinner?


>> If
 if
 if


we
 go
 on
 vacation,
 like
 um
 are
 you


willing
 to
 get
 your
 flight
 and
 I'll
 get


everything
 else?
 Yeah.
 Like
 just


>> she
 doesn't
 have
 to,
 but
 you
 want
 to
 see


the
 intention
 of
 it
 there.
 Exactly


right.
 And
 then
 also
 to
 go
 back
 to
 your


other
 point
 of
 like
 are
 you
 dating
 me


for
 just
 me
 or
 for
 this
 thing?


No
 one's
 dating
 man
 or
 woman
 rich
 or


poor.
 No
 one
 is
 dating
 you
 just
 for
 you.


You
 are
 an
 accumulation
 of
 everything


that
 you
 are.
 Facts.
 What
 you
 your
 sense


of
 humor,
 your
 physical
 appearance,
 your


salary,
 your
 height.
 There
 there's
 perks


and
 draws
 backs
 to
 everybody.
 And
 it's


just
 about
 like
 do
 you
 love
 the
 whole


package
 of
 them
 and
 do
 I
 love
 the
 whole


package
 of
 you?
 That's
 my
 philosophy


about
 it.


>> Do
 you
 think
 women
 are
 attracted
 to
 your


ambition?


>> I
 think
 women
 are
 attracted
 to
 people


that
 act
 on
 their
 ambition.


>> Yeah.


>> Because
 you
 you've
 quite
 clearly
 acted


on
 it.
 You've
 been
 pretty
 successful.


And
 I
 would
 imagine
 that
 has
 to
 be
 a


selling
 point
 as
 well
 when
 you're
 having


these
 conversations.


>> I
 don't
 know.
 I've
 never
 really
 been


like,
 "Hey,
 so
 why
 do
 you
 why
 are
 you


attracted
 to
 me?
 like
 can
 you
 give
 me
 a


bullet
 point
 list
 with
 sublists
 too?


>> So
 I
 I
 don't
 I
 mean
 everyone
 is
 attract


everyone
 that
 is
 attracted
 to
 me
 is


there's
 probably
 some
 overlap
 but


there's
 probably
 different
 things
 for


different
 people
 you
 know
 some
 people
 it


might
 be
 full
 physical
 some
 people
 it


might
 be
 the
 idea
 of
 being
 with


>> a
 famous
 person
 you
 know
 so
 I
 don't
 some


people
 might
 think
 I'm
 funny
 like
 I
 I


don't


>> I
 don't
 really
 know
 what
 it
 is
 but


>> do
 do
 you
 do
 you
 consider
 yourself


famous?


>> Yes
 and
 no.
 Um,


>> like
 are
 you
 do
 you
 get
 stopped
 often?


Is
 are
 you
 dealing
 with
 all
 that
 or
 now


with
 new
 hair?


>> Yes.
 Yes
 and
 no.
 Like
 it
 really
 depends


where
 I'm
 at.


>> Yeah.


>> I'm
 I'm
 grateful
 that
 I
 live
 uh
 I
 have


the
 level
 of
 fame
 where
 I
 get
 some
 of


the
 benefits
 of
 it
 of
 like
 I
 got
 to
 go


courtside
 to
 the
 Knicks
 game
 for
 free.


>> It
 was
 fun.


>> Like
 cool.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was
 sick.
 like
 I
 I
 get
 to
 if
 I


have
 something
 that's
 important
 to
 me


that
 I
 want
 to
 share
 with
 the
 world,
 it


can
 be
 heard,
 you
 know,
 but
 it's
 I'm
 not


like
 at
 the
 level
 where
 I
 can't
 go


anywhere.
 I
 have
 to
 have
 a
 full
 security


with
 me
 24/7.
 And


my
 ego
 is
 not
 so
 fragile
 that
 like
 I'm


upset
 if
 someone
 doesn't
 recognize.


>> I
 can
 sense
 that
 you're
 a
 really
 genuine


guy.
 I
 mean,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 you


have
 that
 type
 of
 ego
 that's


unbreakable,
 you
 know?
 No,
 I
 mean,
 yeah,


I've
 like
 we've
 all
 been
 through
 [ __ ]


Like


>> I'm
 just
 a
 human
 just
 like
 you
 and
 just


like
 whoever's
 watching
 this
 [ __ ]


chat
 right
 now.
 Like


>> I
 just
 have
 a
 different
 set
 of
 skills


and
 I
 played
 my
 cards
 that
 I
 was
 dealt


in
 a
 certain
 way
 and
 now
 I'm
 here.


>> No,


>> but
 um
 I
 don't
 think
 like
 a
 lot
 of


artists
 have
 huge
 egos
 and
 they
 think


that
 they're
 God's
 gift
 to
 earth,
 but


like
 yo,
 you're
 not
 a
 doctor.
 You're
 not


actually
 saving
 no
 one's
 life.
 like


don't
 take
 yourself
 so
 seriously.


>> I
 think
 that's
 fair.
 I
 think
 that's
 very


very
 fair.
 And
 and
 the
 ones
 that
 don't


take
 themselves
 the
 most
 serious,
 I


think,
 are
 the
 ones
 that
 end
 up
 being


the
 most
 relatable.
 Yeah.


>> To
 to
 audiences.
 Um,
 who
 are
 your


favorite
 artists
 in
 the
 industry?


>> Oh,
 I
 love
 Michael
 Jackson.
 I
 love
 Tam


Pala.
 I
 love
 Future.
 I
 love
 Drake.
 I


love
 uh
 Arctic
 Monkeys.
 I
 love
 Young


Thug.
 I
 love
 Shade.
 Oh
 my
 god,
 Shade
 is


the
 best.
 Um,
 I
 have,
 if
 this
 was
 a


music
 stream,
 I
 would
 we
 would
 do
 a
 like


songs
 on
 Spotify.
 Uh,
 who
 was
 your
 rap?


Number
 one.


>> So,
 my
 rap
 was
 Young
 Thug
 was
 my
 number


one
 this
 year,
 I
 think.
 But
 my
 rap
 is


kind
 of
 [ __ ]
 cuz
 I
 I
 accidentally
 like


slept
 streamed
 this
 one
 album
 um
 that


somebody
 had
 sent
 me
 to
 check
 out.
 So,


Young
 Thug,
 The
 Weekend,
 Shade,
 Drake,


and
 Future.
 That's
 my
 top
 five


>> um
 from
 this
 year.
 Yeah.


>> Okay.
 I
 I
 this
 is
 I
 got
 to
 ask
 you
 this


because
 I
 uh
 I'm
 always
 so
 curious
 about


it.
 So,
 if
 you
 had
 to
 name
 your
 top
 five


Drake
 songs
 of
 all
 time.


>> Let's
 take
 a
 look
 cuz
 this
 [ __ ]


has
 like
 300
 songs.


>> He
 really
 is
 the
 quintessential
 artist.


Like
 outside
 of
 Michael
 Jackson,
 I
 don't


think
 there's
 anyone
 bigger
 than
 Drake.


>> I
 really
 don't.


>> There's
 not.
 Worst
 behavior.


>> That's
 your
 That's
 in
 your
 top
 five.


Okay.


>> Uh
 Find
 Your
 Love.


>> Okay.


Um,
 there's
 one
 I
 really
 liked
 off
 of


>> CLB.


>> Uh,
 the
 the the
 one
 with
 Future.


>> Uh,
 no,
 no,
 not
 that
 one.


>> The
 one
 with
 Jay-Z.


>> No,
 not
 that
 one.
 It
 was
 uh
 Pipe
 Down.


>> Pipe
 Down.


>> This
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 best
 Drake


songs.


>> I
 agree.
 I
 agree.


>> Pipe
 Down
 is
 amazing.


>> Jungle.
 Is
 that
 up
 there?


>> Jungle
 is
 definitely
 up
 there.
 Uh,
 let


me
 find
 it.
 I
 I
 don't
 have
 as
 much
 Drake


saved
 as
 I
 thought.
 I
 think
 it's
 just


because
 I
 listen
 to his
 albums
 at
 the


time.


>> By
 the
 way,
 for
 those
 asking
 where
 I
 was


in
 the
 morning
 and
 afternoon,
 I
 got


sick.
 Not
 like
 infection,
 antibiotics


type
 of
 sick,
 just
 I
 don't
 know,
 guys.


Something
 just
 something
 got
 me
 over
 the


weekend.
 I
 think
 I
 was
 walking
 out
 in


the
 cold
 and
 I
 just
 need
 all
 to
 be


honest.


>> Uh,
 this
 is
 really
 good,
 but
 it's
 not.


It's
 Star
 67.
 That's
 great.
 Star
 67
 is


in
 there
 for
 me.


>> And
 then
 maybe
 probably
 like
 a
 old
 Drake


song
 like


>> that
 one
 was
 the
 same
 I
 think
 is


probably
 his
 most
 comprehensive
 album.


Yeah,
 that
 was
 his
 best.
 That
 was
 like


his
 most
 album
 album,
 I
 think.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 Take
 Care
 is
 still
 my
 favorite


though.


>> Oh,
 over.
 This
 was
 the
 first
 Drake
 song


I
 ever
 heard
 like


>> 2010.
 Never
 changed
 my
 life.


>> Drake
 made
 it
 cool
 for
 sensitive


light-skinnings
 like
 myself
 to
 to
 rap.


>> Passion
 Fruit
 is
 goated.


>> Passion
 Fruit
 is
 great,
 too.


>> Absolutely
 goated.


>> He
 has
 too
 many
 good
 songs.
 You
 can't


you
 can't
 just
 pick
 five.


>> No,


>> dude.
 It's
 crazy.
 Do
 Do
 you
 just
 sit


back
 and
 think
 like,
 man,
 I
 guess
 let
 me


ask
 you
 this
 plan.
 This
 is
 a
 question.


What
 is
 the
 next
 fiveyear
 plan


life-wise,
 investment
 wise,
 career-wise?


>> Five
 years,
 30


>> because
 you
 because
 you've
 been
 able
 to


do
 your
 thing.
 You've
 been
 able
 to
 make


it.
 You've
 been
 able
 to
 get
 to
 a


financial
 uh
 situation
 where
 you're


comfortable.
 Um
 I
 mean,
 like,
 where
 do


you
 think
 the
 next
 five
 years
 goes?


>> Well,
 at
 first
 it
 was
 really
 stressful,


like
 I
 said,
 because
 I
 achieved
 so
 many


of
 these
 bucket
 list
 items
 that
 I
 had
 so


fast.
 I
 was
 like,
 "Well,
 what
 do
 what
 do


I
 do
 now?"
 And
 now
 the
 answer
 is
 kind
 of


like,


>> and
 that's
 a
 that's
 see
 that's
 a
 it's
 a


very
 important
 like
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 I


started
 writing
 on
 my
 my
 substack.
 I
 I


launched
 the
 blog
 this
 year
 is
 because


>> like
 I've
 been
 doing
 YouTube
 for
 so
 long


and
 I
 love
 it.
 But
 I
 wanted
 another


challenge
 and
 like
 writing
 I
 hate
 like
 I


hate
 writing.
 So
 I
 love
 writing
 like


tweets
 but
 like
 actually
 long
 form


writing
 I
 hate
 it.
 I
 cannot
 stand
 it.
 So


forcing
 myself
 to
 sit
 down
 and
 write
 it


was
 a
 challenge.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 And
 and
 I


felt
 good
 when
 I
 completed
 it
 and
 I
 want


to
 take
 it
 to
 the
 next
 level
 next
 year.


But
 I
 feel
 like
 you
 constantly
 need
 new


challenges.


>> You
 do.
 Or
 else
 then
 you
 get
 complacent


and
 you
 get
 worse
 at
 whatever
 it
 is.
 And


yes,


>> you
 you
 fall
 out
 of
 love
 with
 it.
 You


get
 jaded.


>> Yes.


>> For
 me,
 I
 think


>> obviously
 music
 is
 still


>> the
 [ __ ]
 blood
 that
 flows
 through
 my


veins.
 But
 something
 that
 I
 always


wanted
 to
 do
 before
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 music


as
 a
 career
 even
 was
 acting.


>> I
 was
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 that.
 Yeah.


I
 feel
 like
 I
 read
 some
 interview
 before


in
 the
 past
 where
 you
 said
 acting.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 when
 I
 was
 a
 little
 kid,
 um
 I


would
 do
 these
 like
 commercials
 and
 I
 I


had
 a
 couple
 of
 commercials
 that
 like


were
 big
 like
 a
 Blue
 Diamond
 Almond
 one


and
 a
 Lunchables
 one
 and
 they
 were


played
 during
 like
 during
 like
 the
 World


Series
 and
 I
 think
 during
 the
 Olympics


and
 stuff
 and
 that
 was
 my
 first
 taste
 of


being
 a
 public
 figure
 because
 when
 I
 go


to
 school
 the
 next
 day
 the
 kids
 were


like,
 "Oh
 my
 god,
 I
 saw
 you
 on
 TV
 last


night."


Um,
 and
 well
 that
 was
 fun.
 Obviously,


it's
 not
 that
 um
 it's
 not
 that
 deep.


Like
 you're
 just


>> you're
 just
 a
 kid
 in


>> I'm
 just
 a
 kid
 in
 Yeah.
 in
 the


commercial.
 But
 I
 have
 like
 a
 a
 true


love
 for
 great
 film
 and
 great
 TV.
 And
 I


feel
 like
 I
 um
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 acting
 is


an
 extension
 of
 storytelling.


>> Yes.
 Yes.


>> And
 I
 love
 storytelling.
 So,
 for
 the


last
 I
 got
 kicked
 out
 of
 my
 first
 acting


class
 actually
 that
 I
 signed
 up
 for
 cuz


the
 teacher
 was
 mad
 I
 went
 on
 tour
 too


much.


>> You
 you
 were
 in
 a
 a
 college.


>> No,
 no,
 this
 was
 this
 was
 like
 last


recently.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 I
 I
 2024
 I
 was
 like,
 "Yo,
 I
 want
 to


take
 this
 more
 seriously.
 I'm
 not
 just


going
 to
 be
 the
 guy
 that
 assumes
 he's


good
 at
 one
 thing,
 so
 he's
 going
 to
 be


good
 at
 the
 other.


>> Let
 me
 like
 go
 to
 a
 class."
 So,
 I
 went


to
 this
 regular
 acting
 class
 in
 LA.
 um


just
 other
 other
 people
 working
 9
 to5


>> people
 just
 trying
 to
 hustle
 make


>> yeah
 but
 I
 got
 kicked
 out
 of
 that
 one


but
 I
 I
 found
 a
 new
 class
 that
 like
 I


absolutely
 love
 and
 before
 I
 even
 came


here
 today
 what
 I
 was
 doing
 before
 I


came
 here
 was
 I
 was
 shooting
 a
 self
 tape


for
 this
 movie
 that
 I'm
 auditioning
 for.


>> So
 that's
 something
 that
 I
 really
 want


to
 explore
 and
 like
 pursue
 more.


>> So
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years
 being
 in
 a


movie
 whether
 big
 or
 small
 but
 getting


that
 first
 movie
 done
 for
 you.


>> Yes.
 What
 are
 your
 top
 five
 favorite


movies?


>> Uh,
 Django
 Unchained,


>> classic.


>> Sorry
 to
 Bother
 You.


>> Amazing
 movie.


>> City
 of
 God.


>> Love
 that
 one,
 too.


>> Um,


>> those
 are
 good
 top
 three
 already.


>> I
 think
 I
 wrote
 this
 down
 because


I
 get
 asked
 this
 question
 a
 lot
 and
 then


I
 always
 forget
 like
 two
 of
 them.


>> Oh,
 those
 three.


>> Uh,
 Slum
 Dog
 Millionaire.


>> Really?
 That's
 in
 your
 top
 five?


>> Yes.


>> Wow.


>> Yes.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 love
 D.
 I
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 Indian,


right?
 That
 was
 a
 big
 deal
 in
 2009
 when


it
 came
 out.
 Like
 that
 was
 a
 big
 one.


Okay,


>> dude.
 The
 soundtrack
 to
 that
 movie
 is


>> amazing.


>> [ __ ]
 god
 tier.


>> Um,
 those
 are
 my
 top
 four.
 What's
 my


fifth

>> Let
 me

into
 your
 top.

 to
 me.


>> Inception.


>> Inception.
 I

 me.


>> Interstellar.


>> You
 want
 to
 know
 something?
 I've
 never


finished
 that
 movie.


>> Why?
 It's
 just
 too
 long.


>> Cuz
 I
 always
 watch
 it
 on
 a
 plane
 and
 I


always
 fall
 asleep
 like
 an
 hour
 in.


>> I
 think
 that's
 worth
 watching.


>> Are
 these
 are
 both
 of
 those
 movies
 in


your
 top
 five?
 Yeah,
 those
 are
 my
 top


five.
 Wolf
 of
 Wall
 Street
 is
 in
 my
 top


five.


>> Wall
 Street's
 great.


>> Um,
 what's
 the
 other
 one?
 Um,
 uh,
 Dark


Knight.


>> Dark
 Knight.
 Yeah,


>> that's
 up
 there
 for
 me.
 You
 know,
 over


the
 weekend,
 guys,
 you
 know
 what
 I
 I


watched?
 I
 watched
 two
 movies
 while
 I


was
 sick.


>> Rounders.


>> Rounders.
 Great.
 Poker
 movie.


>> Poker
 movie.
 And
 then
 The
 Gambler.
 For


some
 reason,
 those
 I
 lit
 I
 legit
 watched


both
 of
 those
 again
 over
 the
 weekend.


>> Did
 you
 like
 them?


>> Yeah,
 I
 Rounders.
 I
 love
 Gambler.
 I


haven't
 seen
 it.
 Gambler
 is
 not
 that


good
 of
 a
 movie,
 but
 like
 I
 like
 the


sort
 of
 like
 story
 of
 it,
 but
 it's
 the


movie
 is
 not
 that
 good.
 The
 Rounders
 is


phenomenal.


>> You
 should
 check
 out
 Molly's
 game.


>> Yeah,
 I
 have
 a
 friend
 whose
 Steve
 has


been
 telling
 me
 about
 that.


>> That's
 a
 good
 one.
 Um
 I
 don't
 know
 my


fifth.
 I
 I'll
 leave
 it
 at
 four
 for
 now


with
 room
 for
 more
 uh
 to
 come.


>> Okay.
 Uh
 we're
 talking
 about
 uh


Rounders.
 Poker.
 You're
 a
 big
 poker
 guy.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 I
 got
 into
 poker
 um
 maybe
 a


year
 ago.
 It
 was
 my
 friend's
 birthday


party
 and
 he
 wanted
 to
 do
 like
 is
 it
 24


karat
 ring,
 by
 the
 way?


>> You
 know,
 I
 don't
 know.
 My
 It's


definitely
 real
 gold.
 My
 uh


>> is
 it
 from
 India?


>> Yeah,
 my
 grandfather
 came
 in
 the
 summer


and
 gave
 this
 to
 me.
 I
 think
 this
 is


ruby.
 I
 don't


>> 24.
 It
 is
 real
 for
 sure.


>> It's
 definitely
 real.
 I
 just
 don't
 know


what
 type.


>> You
 could
 tell
 cuz
 it
 has
 this
 like
 more


yellowower
 color.
 Yeah.


>> See,
 like
 this
 is
 18
 karat.
 Let
 me
 show


I'm
 in
 the
 [ __ ]
 whatever.
 Uh
 I'll


just
 show


>> it
 up
 like
 that.
 There
 you
 go.


>> So,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 well
 you
 can
 see


it,
 but
 the
 the
 this
 one
 this
 eye
 one


right
 here
 is
 18
 karat.
 You
 see
 how
 much


more
 yellow
 it
 looks
 next
 to
 it?


>> Huh?
 That's
 how
 you
 can
 always
 tell
 if


it
 looks
 like
 so
 yellow
 that
 it
 might
 be


fake.
 It's
 not
 fake.
 It's
 24K
 or
 22.


>> Before
 the
 poker,
 how
 did
 you
 get
 the


name
 24K
 Golden?


>> Oh
 yeah.
 So
 when
 I
 first
 started
 making


music,
 I
 just
 was
 going
 by
 Golden.
 Yeah,


cuz
 that's
 my
 real
 name.


>> And
 I
 thought,
 yo,
 my
 name
 is
 cool.
 I


don't
 need
 a
 [ __ ]
 other
 name.


>> But
 I
 realized
 for
 SEO
 purposes,


>> YOU
 TYPE
 IN
 I
 DIDN'T
 KNOW
 THIS
 STORY.


NO,
 this
 Oh
 my
 god.
 You
 are
 a
 [ __ ]


hustler,
 bro.


>> This
 is
 what
 I
 was
 thinking
 about.
 This


is
 when
 I
 was
 15.
 I
 was
 like,
 when
 I


typed
 in
 golden,
 I'm
 getting
 so
 many


other
 things
 that
 aren't
 me.
 So,
 I
 was


like,
 okay,
 well,
 what's
 still
 relates


to
 that?
 Okay,
 24K
 is
 the
 most
 pure
 form


of
 gold.
 Me
 making
 music
 and
 art
 is
 the


most
 pure
 expression
 of
 myself.
 So,
 I'll


be
 24K
 golden.


>> And
 then,


>> and
 it
 worked
 for
 SEO.


>> Yeah.
 But,
 but
 I
 went
 on
 Instagram
 and
 I


typed
 in
 24K
 Golden
 and
 it
 was
 taken.


So,
 I
 had
 to
 drop
 the
 E
 and
 that's
 why


there's
 no
 E.


>> That's
 crazy,
 dude.
 I
 didn't
 know
 that's


why
 it
 was
 I
 mean,
 the
 metaphor
 makes


sense
 about
 the
 puress
 of
 it,
 but
 still.


>> Yeah,
 that
 it
 was
 it
 was
 just
 golden


before.


>> Dude,
 I
 think
 if
 anything,
 this
 stream


has
 identified
 that
 like
 you
 [ __ ]


grind
 and
 hustle
 to
 get
 where
 you
 are,


>> man.
 It's
 been
 Yeah,
 it's
 been
 a
 long


journey.
 I've
 been
 doing
 this
 [ __ ]
 for


like
 10
 years,
 bro.


>> Yeah.
 15.
 Um,
 but
 yeah,
 back
 to
 so
 it


was
 my
 friend's
 birthday,
 my
 homie


Nevin,
 he
 was
 like,
 "Yo,
 for
 my


birthday,
 I'm
 going to
 get
 a
 dealer
 to


come
 to
 the
 house
 and
 we'll
 all
 play."


>> I
 had
 never
 really
 played
 before.
 And
 I


proceeded
 to
 lose
 $1,200


in
 the
 course
 of
 like
 three
 hours.
 And


and
 it
 wasn't
 that
 we
 were
 paying
 for


big
 stakes.
 I
 just
 kept
 buying
 back
 in


because
 I
 was
 [ __ ]
 stupid
 and
 I
 was


drinking
 and
 whatever.
 I
 was
 I
 was
 so


buttth
 hurt.
 I
 think
 they
 went
 out


afterwards
 and
 I
 didn't
 even
 go
 out
 with


them.
 Like
 I
 was
 like,
 "Nah,
 bro.
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 home."
 Like
 I
 I
 already


blew,
 1200.
 [ __ ]
 that.


>> How
 How
 long
 ago
 was
 this?


>> This
 was
 I
 think
 2023.


>> Okay.


>> So
 yeah.
 So
 yeah,
 maybe


>> 1200
 still,
 1200.


>> 1200,
 1200.
 Yeah,
 it
 hurts.


>> Um
 and
 uh


Hey,
 what?
 Side
 note,
 when
 this
 is
 over,


will
 I
 be
 able
 to
 watch
 this
 back
 on


YouTube?


>> Yeah,
 it'll
 be
 on
 YouTube.
 I'll
 put
 some


clips
 on
 X,
 too.


>> Sweet.


>> Um
 you
 should
 get
 a
 clipper
 for
 TikTok,


too,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 one
 on.


>> I've
 been
 told
 that,
 you
 know.


>> Yeah.
 Um,
 so
 boom.
 That
 sends
 me
 on
 this


like
 revenge
 training
 arc
 of
 like
 I'm


gonna
 be
 the
 [ __ ]
 best
 out
 of
 all
 my


friends.
 Like
 I'm
 gonna
 come
 back
 next


year
 for
 his
 birthday
 and
 win
 all
 my


money
 back.
 And
 uh
 so
 I
 watch
 like
 I


start
 off
 by
 watching
 some
 YouTube


videos
 and
 then
 I
 get
 invited
 to
 my


friend
 Donny's
 birthday
 party
 and
 we're


playing
 poker.
 it's
 at
 his
 crib
 and
 um
 I


end
 up
 I
 think
 I
 think
 I
 end
 up
 losing


again.
 Not
 $1,200,
 but
 like
 $400
 or


something
 like
 that.
 So,
 I'm
 like,
 "All


right,
 well,
 at least
 I'm
 not
 losing
 as


bad."


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 just
 One
 thing
 about
 me
 is
 like


when
 when
 I
 have
 a
 failure
 in
 something,


it
 just
 makes
 me
 want
 to
 get
 that
 much


better
 at
 that
 thing.
 So,
 then
 I
 start


grinding
 more
 and
 more
 and
 I'm
 learning


about
 like
 GTO
 and
 solvers,
 game
 theory


optimal.


>> Yep.
 Yep.
 So,
 you
 put
 in
 these


situations
 and
 you
 like
 practice
 and


what
 you
 should
 do
 and
 learning
 about


ranges
 and
 stuff
 like
 that.
 And
 um
 when


I
 start
 feeling
 and
 I
 play
 some
 more


home
 games
 and
 I'm
 starting
 to
 win
 now


and
 when
 I
 start
 feeling
 more
 confident


about
 it
 um
 I
 enter
 this
 celebrity
 poker


tournament.
 It's
 my
 friend
 Blake's
 thing


that
 he
 does.
 I'm
 about
 to
 go
 play
 in
 it


actually
 in
 a
 couple
 days
 in
 the


Bahamas.


>> Okay.


>> And
 uh
 I
 I
 go
 there
 and
 I
 get
 11th
 place


out
 of
 63
 people.
 Wow.


>> So,
 I'm
 like,
 "Okay,
 I
 didn't
 cash,
 but


I
 know
 I'm
 good."


>> All
 that
 training
 actually
 paid
 off


there.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and and
 then
 in
 the
 next
 6


months
 or
 whatever,
 my
 bankroll
 goes
 up


to
 like
 I'm
 plus,00
 or
 no,
 plus
 11,000.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 just
 off
 of
 playing
 poker
 like
 with


friends
 or
 like
 at
 the
 casino
 every
 once


in
 a
 while.
 And
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh
 [ __ ]
 I


think
 I'm
 actually
 kind
 of
 good
 at


this."
 And
 then
 the
 next
 celebrity
 poker


tournament
 comes
 around
 and
 there's
 more


people.
 There's
 like
 70
 people
 this


time.
 and
 I
 end
 up
 at
 the
 finals
 table


and
 I
 placed
 fourth
 and
 I
 I
 cashed
 for


like
 four
 grand
 or
 something
 like
 that


off
 of
 a
 free
 roll.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 now
 in
 uh
 I've
 been
 playing
 more
 and


more
 since
 then.
 And
 now
 like
 I
 I
 think


I
 actually
 know
 what
 the
 [ __ ]
 I'm
 doing


and
 I'm
 about
 to
 go
 to
 the
 Bahamas
 and


do
 the
 celebrity
 poker
 tournament,
 but


also
 I
 got
 um
 an
 entry
 into
 the
 Super


Main,
 the
 WSOP
 Super
 Main,


>> which
 is
 normally
 like
 a
 $25,000
 buyin.


And
 this
 is
 the
 what
 I
 believe
 is
 the


largest
 guaranteed
 prize
 pool
 of
 $60


million.


>> So
 this
 is
 a
 big
 one.
 This
 is
 for


celebrities
 or


>> No,
 no,
 this
 is
 like
 for
 there's
 going


to
 be
 like
 Daniel
 Negranu
 and
 like
 all


the
 real
 poker
 professional
 players


there.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 I'm
 going
 to
 do


because
 the
 competition
 is
 definitely


stiffer.


>> But
 do
 you
 love
 the
 gambling
 aspect
 of


it?
 Do
 you
 love
 the
 game
 theory
 of
 it?


Like
 what
 do
 you
 like?


>> I
 love
 the
 game
 because
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


sports
 bet.
 I
 don't
 play
 blackjack.
 I


don't
 play
 craps.
 I
 only
 play
 poker.


>> And
 for
 me,
 I
 feel
 like
 it
 gives
 you


this
 opportunity
 to
 exercise


um
 this
 strategic


part
 of
 myself
 that
 gets
 feedback
 in


real
 time.
 Yeah.


>> It's
 psychology.
 It's
 statistics.
 It's


>> [ __ ]
 how
 ballsy
 are
 you
 going
 to
 be,


you
 know?
 It's
 personality.
 And
 and
 you


get
 to
 see
 the
 results
 of
 the
 like
 the


composite
 of
 all
 that
 in
 real
 time
 and


make
 money.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 that's
 that's
 what
 I
 like
 about
 it.


It's
 game.
 I
 really
 got
 love
 for
 the


game.


>> I
 you
 know,
 a
 goal
 of
 mine
 in
 2026
 is
 to


learn
 poker
 like
 really
 because
 I
 think


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 investment
 strategies


>> that
 are
 synonymous.
 There's
 obly
 a


whole
 different
 way
 of
 thinking
 of
 like


uh
 getting
 a
 pair
 of
 cards
 and
 and


navigating
 that
 against
 your
 opponent's


pairs
 of
 cards
 and
 kind
 of


psychologically
 counting
 cards,
 looking


at
 but
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 has
 to
 do
 with


investing.
 Like
 when
 Nvidia
 fell
 to
 90,


do
 you
 double
 down
 or
 do
 you
 not?
 Right.


Yeah.


>> When
 you
 have
 a
 good
 hand
 that
 you
 think


is
 better
 than
 your,
 you
 know,
 do
 you


double
 down
 or
 not?
 Do
 you
 fold?
 Do
 you


sell
 the
 stock?


>> It's
 the
 It's
 the
 um
 the
 absence
 of


information.
 What
 What


>> What
 What
 is
 your
 analysis
 to
 fill
 in


the
 gaps?


>> Yeah,
 100%.


>> Dude,
 this
 has
 been
 awesome.
 This
 has


been
 super
 super
 fun.


>> I
 know
 you
 got
 I
 know
 you
 got
 places
 to


go.


>> I
 appreciate
 you,
 bro.
 Thank
 you
 for


having
 me.


>> Okay,
 so
 last
 question
 for
 you.
 Um


>> how
 do
 you
 see
 yourself
 evolving
 as
 an


investor
 over
 the
 next
 five
 years?
 Well,


you
 know
 what?
 What
 I
 would
 have
 loved


to
 do
 is
 is
 [ __ ]
 knock
 some
 of
 these


uh
 tickers
 off
 of
 my
 list,
 bro.


>> Yeah.
 This
 No,
 no.
 On
 on
 some
 real
 [ __ ]


like
 I
 think
 you
 really
 do
 got
 to
 get


rid
 of
 some
 of
 this
 stuff.


>> How
 how
 would
 this
 is
 my
 question
 for


you.
 What
 should
 be
 like
 the
 checklist


of
 questions
 that
 I
 ask
 myself
 to
 decide


whether
 to
 keep
 something
 or
 not?


>> That's
 a
 great
 question.
 I
 would
 love


the
 chat
 to
 uh
 answer
 that
 question
 as


well.
 So
 the
 question
 is
 what
 is
 the


checklist
 of
 questions
 you
 would
 ask


yourself
 if
 this
 was
 your
 portfolio


to
 sell
 or
 get
 them?
 I
 think
 number
 one


is
 which
 one
 do
 you
 genuinely
 want
 to


hold
 for
 the
 next
 decade?
 Not
 five
 years


but
 decade.
 Like
 hood
 I
 can
 say
 decade.


>> You
 know
 and
 Nvidia
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I


can
 say
 dec
 I
 could
 definitely
 say
 five


years
 and
 I
 I'm
 really
 bullish
 Nvidia.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 don't
 know if
 I
 can
 say
 decade
 just


because
 the
 cyclicality
 but
 hood
 I
 can
 I


think
 I
 can
 legit
 say
 decade.
 Tesla
 I


can
 legit
 say
 decade.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think


that
 would
 be
 one
 question.
 Yeah,
 Nate's


question
 right
 here.
 TAM.
 So
 which
 one


has
 the
 biggest
 total
 addressable


market?
 Obviously
 financial
 services


with
 Hood
 just
 a
 massive
 massive
 market.


>> Like
 which
 has
 the
 the
 largest
 market


that
 they
 can
 hit
 that
 they
 haven't
 hit


yet.


>> Yeah.
 Which
 is
 like
 So
 Hood
 just


acquired
 a
 company
 in
 Indonesia.
 So


they're
 going
 to
 become
 a
 uh
 a
 brokerage


in
 in
 Southeast
 Asia
 now.
 Like
 those
 are


18
 million
 people


>> that
 uh
 they
 can
 go
 after
 and
 there's


350
 million
 people
 in
 in in
 Indonesia


alone.
 There's
 330
 million
 people
 in


America.
 So
 like
 Hood
 only
 has
 27


million
 American
 accounts.
 There's


probably
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 more


they
 can
 get.
 So
 that
 TAM
 is
 so
 big.


Shopify
 for
 example,
 their
 TAM
 is
 like


>> anywhere
 outside
 of
 Amazon
 to
 sell


t-shirts
 or
 candles
 or
 anything
 online,


it
 happens
 to
 their
 platform.
 Like


there's
 competitors,
 but
 like
 they
 are


the
 legit
 guys.


>> So
 Shopify
 I
 would
 hold
 for
 10
 years
 and


not


>> not
 really
 care.
 The
 se
 the
 third
 one


which
 is
 a
 big
 one
 is
 can
 you
 trust


management?
 Mhm.


>> I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 big
 one.
 Like
 uh
 can


you
 actually
 trust
 that
 the
 people
 that


are
 stewards
 of
 your
 capital
 will
 like


do
 well?
 Like
 I
 trust
 Vlad,
 I
 trust


Karp.
 I
 trust
 Jensen.
 I
 think
 you
 could


trust
 Toby
 at
 Shopify.
 There's
 some


people
 that,
 you
 know,
 the
 open
 door


CEO.
 I
 don't
 know if
 I
 trust
 him
 yet.


>> Yeah,


>> but
 maybe
 he
 had
 a
 good
 run
 at
 Shopify,


but
 can
 he
 really
 produce
 results
 here?


This
 one
 I
 think
 by
 Tanner.
 Do
 you


honestly
 know
 what
 the
 business
 does
 and


why
 they're
 winning?
 If
 not,
 immediately


sell.
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 big
 one.
 Like
 I


have
 my
 yolo
 like
 I'll
 buy
 this
 for


whatever
 reason
 and
 like,
 you
 know,


we'll
 see.
 But
 if
 it's
 a
 legit
 position,


I
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 explain
 it
 to
 a


third
 grader
 and
 then
 to
 someone
 who
 has


a
 PhD
 in
 that


>> uh
 sector,
 right?


>> So,
 if
 I'm
 like
 really
 holding
 on
 to
 it,


I
 I
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 meaningfully


>> Shout
 out
 Tanner.
 That's
 Tanner.


>> Tanner.


>> Thank
 you,
 Tanner.


>> Yeah,
 he's
 dope.
 He's
 one
 he's
 he's


another
 person
 that
 streams
 on
 YouTube.


Um
 there's
 like
 honestly
 five
 of
 us
 that


stream
 every
 day
 and
 Tanner
 is
 one
 of


them.
 So,


>> he's
 he's
 one
 of
 my
 good
 friends
 in
 this


in
 this
 game.
 Um,


oh,
 I
 like
 this
 one.
 Sell
 everything


with
 under
 a thousand
 bucks
 with
 your


portfolio
 size.
 Those
 are
 dead
 weight.


Yeah,
 I
 agree,
 dude.
 Your
 portfolio


size,
 you
 don't
 need
 something
 with
 less


than
 a
 I
 think
 the
 average
 size
 of
 a


position
 in
 your
 portfolio,


given
 the
 size
 of
 it,
 probably
 needs
 to


have
 a
 cut
 off
 at
 10,000.


>> Like,
 don't
 buy
 something
 unless
 I'm


willing
 to
 put
 10K
 into
 it.


>> Yes.
 Yes,
 that's
 what
 I
 would
 think.


>> So,
 would
 you
 would
 you
 amend
 that
 to


say
 sell
 everything
 with
 under
 10,000


bucks?


>> Yeah.
 Or
 and
 if
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 sell
 it,


put
 more
 bread
 into.


>> Yes,
 100%.


>> Because
 like
 like
 Loheed
 Martin,
 like
 I


don't
 know
 how
 much
 you
 have
 in
 that,


but
 it's
 like


>> is
 that
 Yeah.
 Is
 that
 if
 you
 got
 like


$2,000
 like
 that
 could
 be
 compounding
 in


Hood
 and
 you
 understand
 Hood
 way
 better


than
 like
 a
 defense
 contractor.
 Right.


>> Totally.


>> So
 I
 think
 that


>> I
 think
 I
 bought
 that
 like
 when
 the


North
 Korean
 uh
 war
 thing
 was
 like


allegedly


>> that
 was
 a
 couple
 years
 ago,
 right?


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 like
 in
 like
 like
 mad


years
 ago
 like
 first
 uh
 Trump
 presidency


or
 something
 when
 they
 were
 beefing
 and


I
 was
 like
 oh
 miss
 probably
 good.
 Yeah,


>> dude.
 So
 you
 just
 buy
 [ __ ]
 off
 like


ideas
 and
 then
 you
 hold
 it


>> which
 I
 which
 I
 I
 I
 admire
 because
 like


you
 con
 you
 have
 a
 diversified
 but
 like


for
 compounding
 Yeah.


>> just
 because
 like
 I
 mean
 if
 I
 look
 at
 my


returns
 obviously
 it's
 skewed
 because
 I


added
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 in
 recently
 which


is
 one
 thing
 I
 think
 Hood
 needs
 to
 fix.


>> They
 need
 to
 fix
 that.
 when
 you
 take


money
 out,
 they
 need
 time
 weighted


returns.
 Yeah,
 they
 need
 to
 fix
 that


[ __ ]
 100%.


>> Um,
 but
 yeah,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 like
 being


young
 and
 like
 very


and
 being
 a
 sponge,
 I'm
 able
 to
 soak
 in


a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 and
 like
 I
 might
 not


fully
 understand
 why
 something
 works,


but
 have
 a
 vibe
 like
 vibe
 investing
 a


little
 bit.
 You
 got
 vibe
 coding,
 you


know,
 you
 got
 vibe
 investing
 and


sometimes
 it
 works
 out,
 sometimes
 it


doesn't.
 No,
 but
 it's
 like
 a
 legit


thing,
 dude.
 the
 amount
 of
 like
 so
 I
 I


have
 some
 some
 friends
 who
 are
 pretty


wealthy
 and
 the
 amount
 of
 times
 they've


texted
 me
 a
 screenshot
 of
 just
 like


500,000
 shares
 buying
 something
 like
 you


know
 because
 they
 don't
 care.
 They're


just
 like
 well
 I
 have
 the
 money
 I
 think


it
 might
 go
 up
 and
 if
 it
 goes
 up
 a


couple
 bucks
 I
 just
 made
 a
 million


dollars.
 So
 that
 that
 and
 then
 there's


people
 like
 you
 and
 me
 that
 can't
 throw


500,000
 shares
 into
 something
 but
 you


know
 throw
 a
 thousand
 shares,
 see
 how
 it


plays
 out.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 then
 and
 then
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


But
 I
 I
 also
 think
 you
 should


thematically
 define
 your
 portfolio.
 So


like
 um
 fintech
 is
 a
 theme
 for
 the
 next


>> 10
 years
 and
 how
 do
 you
 want
 to
 play


that?
 Semiconductors
 that's
 a
 theme.
 AI


obviously
 that's
 a
 theme.
 Retailers
 like


so
 that's
 where
 your
 Costco
 comes
 in.
 Uh


space
 right
 like
 Rocket
 Lab.
 I
 don't


know if
 you
 mentioned
 that
 one.


>> I
 did.
 Yeah.


>> You
 did
 that
 that's
 that
 name
 has
 been


really
 good
 for
 our
 community
 and
 a
 lot


of
 people
 got
 in
 under
 10
 bucks
 and
 you


know


>> it's
 the
 second
 biggest
 what
 satellite


company
 after
 SpaceX
 right


>> I
 believe.
 So
 yeah


>> they're
 like
 20
 billion
 30
 billion
 and


SpaceX
 like
 800
 bill.
 So,
 if
 they're
 a


baby
 SpaceX,
 that's
 your
 thesis.
 You


don't
 need
 to
 know
 that
 much
 more
 about


it,
 but
 like,
 you
 know,
 I'd
 rather
 take


a
 lot
 of these
 random
 names
 and
 just


dump
 it
 into
 Rocket
 Lab.


>> Yeah,
 totally.


>> Uh
 because
 you
 already
 have
 Hood
 for


crypto.
 Do
 you
 need
 bullish?


>> No.


>> Right.
 So,
 like
 that
 just
 should
 go
 into


something
 where
 I
 think
 you


>> That
 was
 like
 a
 I
 when
 Robin
 Hood
 was


doing
 all
 these
 IPOs
 and
 I'm
 like,
 let


me
 just
 put
 a
 little
 money
 into
 everyone


and
 see
 what
 happens.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> None
 of
 them
 really


>> took
 off.


>> Yeah.


>> Think
 took
 off.


>> I
 mean,
 it
 did,
 but
 then
 Yeah.


>> Do
 you
 uh
 do
 you
 care
 about
 SoFi?
 Do
 you


know
 about
 that
 one?


>> Yeah,
 I
 did.
 Um,
 they
 brought
 me
 to
 the


Super
 Bowl
 a
 couple
 years
 ago,
 so
 I
 got


a
 lot
 of
 love
 for
 them.
 I
 to
 my


understanding,
 it's
 like
 a
 fintech


company
 that


>> is
 less
 so
 on
 the
 investing
 side,
 but


more
 of
 like


>> banking.


>> Banking.
 Yeah.
 If
 you
 want
 a
 mortgage
 or


a
 loan
 or
 whatever.


>> Yeah.


>> I
 mean,
 I
 I
 don't
 really
 understand
 it


enough
 to
 invest
 or
 to
 invest
 in
 it.


>> When
 you
 think
 of
 SoFi
 and
 Hood,
 is


there
 a
 certain
 vibe
 that
 Hood
 gives
 you


versus
 SoFi?
 SoFi
 feels
 more
 like


corporate
 and
 Robin
 Hood
 feels
 more
 like


>> young
 hip
 cultural
 millennial.


>> It's
 uh
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 an
 answer


that
 I've
 gotten
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 people.


>> I
 mean
 SoFi
 the
 stock
 has
 done
 very
 well


but
 like
 hood
 is
 just
 it
 feels
 like


Vlad's
 on
 a
 mission
 to
 get
 to
 a
 trillion


dollar
 market
 cap.


>> Yeah.


>> You
 know


>> So
 is
 a
 bank.
 There's
 some
 other
 good


parts
 to
 it.
 I
 bought
 I
 have
 SoFi.


>> It's
 just
 a
 question
 of
 you
 know
 does
 it


resonate
 with
 that
 many
 people?
 How
 many


uh
 positions
 do
 you
 have?


>> I
 think
 I
 have
 about
 12
 right
 now.


>> And
 what's
 the
 most
 that
 you've
 had
 like


after
 knowing
 what
 you're
 doing?


>> What
 do
 you
 mean?


>> Like
 Well,
 I
 don't
 know
 your
 entire
 like


I'm
 sure
 there
 was
 a


>> You
 mean
 the
 most
 percentage
 it's
 been


like
 for
 polio?


>> No.
 No.
 Like
 the
 largest
 amount
 of
 like


share
 uh
 not
 shares
 um
 different
 stocks


that
 you
 held.


>> Oh,
 like


>> at
 like
 at
 at
 one
 time.


>> Okay.
 So,
 so
 similar
 to
 you
 back
 in


2020,
 I
 think
 I
 had
 like
 a
 100
 tickers.


Like
 it
 was
 just
 really
 stupid
 stuff.


And
 then
 I
 I
 said
 that's
 dumb.
 I


consolidate
 into
 one
 ticker.
 And
 that


ticker
 I'll
 show
 you
 right
 here
 in
 the


chat.


>> Volunteer.
 What
 was
 it?


>> No,
 that
 was
 that
 took
 another
 couple


years
 before
 that.
 That
 that
 ticker
 was


this
 bad.


>> YOU
 WENT
 TO
 A
 OH,
 NO.
 That's
 a
 lot
 of


red.


>> I
 I
 bought
 like
 30,000
 shares
 of
 it.


>> Was
 this
 like
 a
 like
 a
 biotech?


>> I
 thought
 they
 were
 going
 to
 solve


cancer.
 I
 thought
 they
 were


>> I
 have
 a
 couple
 of
 joints
 like
 that,


too.


>> And
 I
 was
 like,
 Purple
 Biotech,
 it's


legit.
 like
 they
 they're
 actually
 called


Kito
 Pharmaceuticals.
 But
 there
 there's


like
 there's
 their
 chemical
 NT219
 if


anyone
 wants
 to
 look
 it
 up.
 It
 was
 but
 I


lost
 all
 my
 money
 in
 that
 and
 then
 I
 had


to
 start
 from
 scratch
 and
 that's
 when
 I


found
 the
 next
 ticker
 that
 actually


started
 with
 a
 P
 that
 also
 had
 a


business
 model
 which
 was
 pounder


>> but
 I
 bought
 it
 at
 25
 and
 then
 it
 fell


all
 the
 way
 to
 six
 and
 so


>> it
 taught
 me
 what
 does
 it
 mean
 to
 double


down
 believe
 in
 something
 basically
 I


was
 100%
 in
 and
 then
 when
 I
 had
 Robin


Hood
 then
 became
 50/50
 and
 then
 this


year
 it
 kind
 of
 like
 literally
 last
 year


it
 was
 just
 an
 inbounder.


>> Wow.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 first
 year
 where


I've
 actually
 diversified
 and
 I
 want
 to


diversify
 more
 going
 into
 next
 year.


>> Why
 do
 you
 want
 to
 diversify
 more?


>> Well,
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 I've
 been
 relying


on
 two
 names
 for
 the
 past
 couple
 years.


And
 like,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 have
 two
 good


ideas,
 you
 run
 with
 those
 good
 ideas.


>> But
 at
 some
 point,
 those
 ideas
 are
 not


going to
 be
 able
 to
 return
 what
 they've


done
 in
 the
 past.
 So,
 Nvidia
 was
 a
 big


one
 this
 year.
 Shout
 out
 to
 Tanner.
 He


got
 me
 into
 that
 one
 as
 well.


>> What
 What
 price
 did
 you
 get
 in
 around?


>> My
 average
 is
 125.
 I
 I
 got
 in
 at
 140,


then
 at
 90,
 and
 then
 103
 to
 like
 115.
 I


was
 buying
 a
 lot.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 I
 even
 bought
 last
 week
 or
 was
 it


last
 week
 last
 Monday
 at
 180
 and
 the


week
 before
 that
 170
 because
 now
 I've


seen
 the
 growth.
 Now
 I
 see
 the
 numbers


now.
 I'm
 like,
 "Oh,
 this
 is
 cheap."


>> Because
 I've
 also
 learned
 how
 to
 analyze


Nvidia
 and
 just
 stocks
 in
 general
 better


to
 be
 able
 to
 make
 an
 assumption
 around


that.
 But
 I
 think
 diversification
 makes


sense.
 I
 just
 think
 at
 our
 age,
 you


know,
 more
 than
 15
 positions
 is
 pushing


it.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 We're
 not
 We
 don't
 It's
 not


like
 a
 we
 need
 like
 a
 [ __ ]
 bond


portfolio
 dividend
 thing.


>> You
 know
 what's
 funny,
 guys?
 I
 was


reading
 the
 stat
 yesterday.
 If
 you
 had


bought
 30-year
 bonds
 back
 in
 1980,
 you


saw
 this,
 right?


>> 15%
 risk-free
 return.


>> Vulker
 jacked
 it
 up
 to
 15%.
 And
 if
 you


had
 held
 those
 bonds
 to
 maturity
 from


2011,
 you
 would
 have
 averaged
 better


than
 Bergkshire
 Hadley
 over
 30
 because


Bergkshire
 only
 did
 14%.
 Which
 is
 crazy


that
 at
 some
 level
 the
 markets
 can
 be


cruel
 enough
 to
 not
 give
 you
 a


compounded
 like
 the
 we've
 been
 blessed


past
 four
 years
 has
 been
 a
 bull
 market,


right?
 Like
 we
 kind
 of
 only
 know
 what


because
 2008
 you
 didn't
 really


>> Well,
 was
 that
 No,
 I
 wasn't
 investing


then.
 No,
 no,
 no.


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 barely
 knew
 it
 was
 happening.


2022
 was
 like, "All
 right,
 it
 was
 a


nasty
 year,
 but
 that
 was
 just
 a
 lot
 of


inflation,
 rate
 hikes."


>> So
 bonds
 back
 then
 actually
 outperformed


stocks
 over
 30
 years,
 which
 is
 quite


incredible
 and
 you
 know,
 hopefully
 that


doesn't
 happen
 again.
 Do
 you
 pay


attention
 to
 JPAL
 a
 lot?


>> Like
 the
 memes
 around
 him?


>> Yes.
 Memes.
 Yeah.
 But
 like
 I
 don't
 know.


It's
 quantitative
 easing
 market
 go
 up


quantitative
 tightening
 market
 go
 down.


Um
 that's
 yeah
 that's
 kind
 of
 all
 I
 see.


I
 know
 they're
 talking
 about
 trying
 to


kick
 him
 out
 and
 throw
 somebody
 else
 in


there.
 I
 don't
 know.


>> Do
 you
 think
 any
 rappers
 even
 know


Jerome
 Pal?
 Like
 when
 I'm
 say
 you
 know


who
 he
 is,
 but
 do
 you
 think
 they
 even


like
 kind
 of
 care?


>> Probably
 none
 of
 my
 peers.
 Yeah.


>> But
 he
 affects
 a
 lot
 of
 thingsffect
 the


world.
 Yeah.
 His
 word
 changes
 people's


lives.
 um
 on
 a
 trickle
 down
 effect.
 But


yeah,


>> that's
 crazy.


>> Um
 anything
 else
 I
 should
 take
 into


consideration?
 Any
 advice,
 any
 wisdom


you
 want
 to
 pass
 on
 to
 a
 a
 young
 scholar


like
 myself?


>> I
 I
 would
 just
 consolidate
 this.
 I


really
 do
 think
 I
 think
 like
 we
 we
 can


do
 a
 update
 in
 like
 a
 month.
 But
 I
 think


going
 into
 2026,
 this
 should
 turn
 into


15
 positions
 max.


>> And
 then
 you'll
 and
 first
 of
 all,
 you've


also
 got
 your


>> [ __ ]
 covered.


>> Yeah.
 V
 VTI,
 you've
 covered
 a
 lot
 of


ground
 if
 you're
 trying
 to
 get
 more


diverse.
 So
 like
 Ford,
 like
 do
 you


really
 need
 Ford?


>> No,
 no,
 I
 don't
 actually.


>> So
 some
 of
 these
 names
 I
 think


immediately
 you
 can
 consolidate.


>> Oh,
 so
 one
 last
 question
 then
 I
 guess


before
 I
 got
 to
 go
 with
 certain
 things


that
 I
 bought
 like


um
 let
 me
 find


>> guys.
 I'm
 putting
 his
 Twitter
 right
 here


in
 the
 chat.
 Make
 sure
 to
 follow
 him.
 He


was
 awesome
 enough
 to
 come
 on
 the


stream.
 He
 had
 a
 concert
 last
 night.
 I


wish
 I
 could
 go,
 but
 hopefully
 next
 time


I'll
 be
 able
 to
 make
 it.
 So
 like
 let's


let's
 take
 a
 Ford
 for
 example,
 right?
 Or


or
 positions
 where
 like
 I'm
 down
 in
 um


but
 there's
 like
 a
 potential
 that
 they


go
 up
 for
 whatever
 reason.
 Not
 let's
 not


say
 for
 but
 just
 in
 general.
 Yeah.


>> Is
 it
 should
 I
 just
 wait
 until
 it
 goes


up
 or
 just
 sell
 it
 at
 a
 loss
 and
 just


keep
 moving
 forward?


>> I
 think
 it
 depends
 on
 how
 much
 you


believe.
 Like
 some
 of
 those
 IPOs
 like


Gemini
 I
 think
 they
 IPOed
 at
 30.
 They're


at
 like
 14
 right
 now.
 Yeah.
 That
 thing's


not
 doubling
 anytime.
 You
 got
 to
 be


honest.
 It's
 a
 dud.
 Yeah.
 And
 that's


okay.
 Like
 it
 happens.
 It
 happens,


>> you
 know.
 And
 so
 my
 dad
 bought
 Gemini


the
 other
 day.
 I
 looked
 at
 I
 was
 like,


"Dad,
 when
 did
 you
 buy
 a
 100
 shares?"
 He


was
 like, "Oh,
 I
 thought
 it
 was
 like
 a


good
 idea."
 I
 was
 like, "Oh
 my
 goodness,


bro."
 So
 he's
 not
 getting
 that
 back.


It's
 It's
 a
 L.
 Like
 it
 is.


>> You
 think
 it
 was
 like
 the
 Google
 Gemini?


>> I
 don't
 know
 what
 he
 just
 thought
 he
 was


special
 because
 he
 got
 allocated
 shares


from
 us.
 I
 was
 like, "Yeah,
 that's
 not


how
 it
 works."


>> But
 um
 but
 yeah,
 like
 if
 it's
 a
 loser,


it's
 a
 loser.
 And
 that's
 okay
 because


you
 have
 plenty
 of
 winner
 and
 a
 Here's


my
 biggest
 rule.
 I
 think
 averaging
 up
 in


winners.
 I
 missed
 this
 with
 Paler


because
 I
 got
 so
 early
 into
 pounder.
 I


was
 afraid
 to
 average
 up
 when
 in
 reality


there's
 not
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 that
 are


deserving
 of
 your
 capital
 and
 if
 their


stocks
 go
 up
 you
 have
 to
 be
 conscious
 of


valuation
 that
 it's
 like
 very
 important


but
 you
 can't
 be
 so
 conscious
 that
 you


think
 something
 else
 is
 a
 better


opportunity
 than
 an
 idea
 that's
 just


beginning
 to
 inflect
 yeah


>> and
 with
 hood
 I
 didn't
 make
 that
 mistake


from
 40
 to
 120
 I
 was
 like
 I
 don't
 care


>> any
 about
 the
 valuation
 I
 care
 about


this
 growth
 story
 and
 now
 it's
 just
 a


question
 of
 if
 the
 growth
 story
 is


sustainable


>> and
 what
 when
 does
 something
 become


overvalued
 to
 you
 is
 it
 a
 specific


specific
 like
 PE
 number
 is
 it
 like


>> well
 given
 pounders
 at
 a
 600
 PE
 uh
 I


guess
 you
 can
 say
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


necessarily
 think
 that's
 like
 look
 a
 lot


of
 people
 think
 pounder
 is
 expensive


hood
 is
 expensive
 I
 go
 by
 the
 quality
 of


company
 and
 what
 I'm
 getting
 for
 paying


that
 multiple
 so
 uh
 if
 you're
 paying
 for


a
 stock
 that
 has
 like
 a
 50
 times
 price


of
 sales
 or
 a
 700
 PE
 or
 something
 crazy


the
 question
 is
 can
 they
 put
 up
 the


growth
 Tesla
 is
 a
 unique
 story
 because


Tesla
 trades
 at
 a
 200
 times
 price


earnings


>> but
 it
 doesn't
 grow


>> yeah
 at


the
 last
 couple
 years.


>> The
 last
 couple
 years
 and
 Elon
 said
 by


the
 end
 of
 2026
 it'll
 grow.
 So
 the


reason
 it's
 getting
 this
 premium
 is


because
 everyone's
 expecting
 the
 growth.


>> So
 does
 that
 mean
 you
 sell
 Tesla
 because


it
 trades
 at
 200?
 No.
 Because
 you
 would


have
 got
 it
 wrong
 in
 2018,
 Amazon,
 Uber,


all
 these
 names
 that
 have
 done
 four,


five
 over
 the
 past
 10
 years,
 you
 would


have
 missed
 out
 on
 them.
 Same
 thing
 with


Palanteer
 and
 Hood.
 So
 with
 Palanteer


for
 example,
 like
 with
 this
 600
 PE,


>> doesn't
 that
 doesn't
 that
 mean
 that
 they


have
 to
 grow
 Yeah.
 600
 times
 to
 be
 worth


what
 the
 market
 is
 putting
 them
 at
 worth


today?


>> Yeah,
 it
 means
 they
 have
 to
 grow
 a
 lot


to
 pay
 back
 the
 money
 that
 you're
 paying


per
 share.


>> I
 think
 that
 Palunteer
 is
 likely
 going


to
 be
 in
 a
 range
 over
 the
 next
 years.


Like
 it
 went
 from
 6
 to
 200.
 So
 if
 it


stays
 from,


>> you
 know,
 150
 to
 220
 over
 the
 next


couple
 years,
 people
 can't
 be
 upset.


People
 might
 be
 upset
 because
 they
 might


have
 bought
 it
 later
 than,
 you
 know,


early
 on.
 But
 if
 it
 stays
 in
 a
 range
 and


it
 continues
 to
 grow,
 I
 think
 it
 grows


into
 the
 valuation.


>> Okay.
 So
 then
 it'll
 have
 it'll
 it'll


it's
 like


>> it'll
 still
 be
 expensive
 but
 not
 as


expensive.


>> That
 makes
 sense.


>> You
 know,
 but
 if
 it
 goes
 to
 like
 $300,


that
 means
 something
 about
 it
 is
 so


phenomenal
 that
 people
 are


underestimating
 even
 today
 at
 this


price.
 And
 that's
 where
 you
 have
 to
 see.


The
 good
 thing
 about
 having
 a
 lower
 cost


basis
 like
 you
 have
 on
 Pound
 or
 Apple
 is


like


>> you
 don't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]


>> You
 don't
 give
 a
 [ __ ]
 Yeah.


>> If
 it
 goes
 down,
 it's
 like,
 all right,


your
 margin
 of
 safety
 is
 so
 high.
 It's


like
 whatever.


>> Yep.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 man.


>> 24K
 Golden.
 Um,
 I
 just
 want
 to
 say
 chat,


thank
 you
 all
 787
 of
 you
 here
 right
 now.


Thank
 you
 for
 watching
 this


conversation.
 I've
 been
 a
 fan
 of
 this


guy
 for
 a
 long
 time.
 If
 you're
 here,


you're
 in
 the
 right
 place.
 And
 uh


hopefully
 I
 think
 I
 might
 come
 back
 in


January.
 It
 would
 be
 fun
 to
 do
 an
 update


as
 well.


>> Let's
 do
 it.
 Let's
 do
 it.
 I'll
 be
 here.


>> Um,
 let
 me
 see.
 What
 can
 I
 plug?
 Uh,
 oh


yeah,
 I'm
 going
 on
 tour
 in
 the
 south
 of


America.
 Not
 South
 America,
 but
 the


southern
 region
 of
 America
 in
 January,


and
 I
 just
 put
 out
 a
 new
 project
 on
 my


birthday
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago
 called


Icarus.
 I
 love
 it.
 So,
 go
 and
 check
 that


out.


>> June
 was
 one
 of
 my
 favorite
 songs.


>> Oh,
 good.
 Yeah,
 it
 was
 really
 great
 last


night.
 You
 missed
 out.


>> I
 wish
 I
 really
 wish
 I
 could
 come


through.
 Thank
 you,
 man.
 Love
 you
 guys.


>> Appreciate
 I'll
 see
 you
 guys
 on
 the


market
 open
 tomorrow.
 Bye
 everybody.


Have
 a
 good
 one.
