>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLots
 [music]
 podcast.
 I'm
 Jill


Weisenthal


>> and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.
 Tracy,
 it
 feels


like
 2026
 could
 be
 a
 big
 year
 for
 some


mega
 IPOs
 that
 have
 been
 private
 for
 a


while.
 There's
 talk
 about
 a
 SpaceX
 IPO,


possibly
 maybe
 some
 of
 the
 big
 AI
 labs.


Like
 some
 pretty
 massive
 companies
 that


might
 be
 uh
 hitting
 the
 market
 soon.


>> Someone
 recently
 gave
 me
 a
 Facebook
 IPO


hat
 from
 JP
 Morgan
 when
 they
 worked
 on


it.
 Like
 I'm
 very
 proud.
 I
 need
 to
 start


wearing
 it
 around
 the
 office.


>> Yeah,
 I
 remember.


>> But
 that
 was
 like
 that
 was
 a
 mega
 IPO.


There
 was
 a
 mega


>> at
 the
 time
 and
 there
 was
 so
 much
 hype


about
 it
 and
 then
 like
 technical


difficulties
 and


>> so
 many
 people
 eager
 to
 get
 in
 on
 that


one.


>> It's
 so
 many
 funny
 people
 called
 that
 a


flop
 I
 guess
 because
 the
 technical


difficulties
 and
 it
 didn't
 do
 that
 great


for
 a
 little
 bit.
 That
 would
 have
 been
 a


great
 time
 to
 buy
 it.


>> Yeah.
 And
 seriously,


>> the
 interesting
 thing
 about
 the
 um


market
 or
 one
 of
 the
 interesting
 things


about
 the
 market
 is
 you
 have
 these


companies
 that
 are
 going
 to
 IPO
 when


they're
 already
 gigantic.
 So
 like
 people


point
 out
 that
 in
 earlier
 eras
 they


might
 have
 IPOed
 when
 they're
 like


billion-dollar
 companies
 and
 now
 they're


like
 octicorns
 or
 whatever.
 And
 then
 you


have
 other
 companies
 that
 are
 also


enormous
 and
 there's
 no
 it's
 not
 clear


that
 they're
 going
 to
 IPO
 at
 all.
 You


know
 I
 saw
 a
 headline
 about
 Stripe


perhaps
 raising
 more
 money.
 People
 been


they
 could
 have
 probably
 IPOed
 years


ago.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 questions
 I
 have
 is


are
 companies
 choosing
 not
 to
 IPO
 or


delaying
 IPO
 because
 the
 public
 market


is
 not
 that
 fun
 or
 because
 the
 private


market
 has
 gotten
 so
 much
 richer,
 so


much
 more
 liquid,
 etc.
 that
 that
 impulse


to
 go
 public
 just
 isn't
 the
 same
 way
 as


it
 might
 have
 been
 in
 a
 different


generation.


>> Yeah,
 this
 has
 kind
 of
 been
 a
 longunning


question
 in
 the
 market
 for
 a
 while
 now.


But
 one
 thing
 I
 would
 just
 point
 out
 on


the
 last
 point,
 it
 feels
 to
 me
 like


companies
 in
 the
 private
 market,
 even


though
 they're
 in
 the
 private
 market


where
 presumably
 the
 pool
 of
 capital
 is


smaller.


>> Yeah,


>> it
 feels
 like
 they're
 always


fundraising.


>> This
 is
 the
 other
 thing
 too
 that
 like
 it


used
 to
 be
 when
 I
 started
 covering
 tech


companies,
 it's
 like
 your
 series
 A
 round


and
 series
 B
 round
 and
 C
 and
 now
 it
 just


seems
 like
 this
 permanent
 round,


especially
 with
 some
 of
 the
 AI


companies,


>> always
 be
 raising,


>> always
 raising.
 Anyway,
 we
 need
 to
 learn


more
 about
 how
 giant
 companies
 are


thinking
 about
 capital
 markets,
 both


public
 and
 private.
 And
 I'm
 really


excited
 to
 say
 we
 do
 in
 fact
 absolutely


have
 the
 perfect
 guest.
 We're
 going
 to


be
 speaking
 with
 David
 George.
 He
 is
 the


head
 of
 the
 uh
 growth
 fund
 at
 Andre


Horitz
 A16Z.


Someone
 perfectly
 situated
 to
 explain
 of


all
 these
 things
 that's
 going
 on.
 So


David,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 uh
 coming


on
 OddLots.


>> Hey,
 great
 to
 be
 with
 you
 all.


>> What
 is
 a
 growth
 fund?
 What
 is
 the
 I


thought
 all
 VC
 was
 growth.
 What
 does
 it


mean
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 a
 growth
 fund
 or


a
 growth
 round
 when
 we're
 talking
 about


private
 markets?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 our
 first
 of
 all,
 it's
 great


to
 be
 with
 you
 all.
 Thanks
 for
 having


me.
 Excited
 to
 have
 this
 conversation.


So,
 our
 early
 stage
 funds
 invest
 in


companies
 that
 are
 growing
 fast
 too.
 So,


if
 that's
 not
 clear,
 that
 is
 what
 we


seek
 to
 do
 across
 all
 pools
 capital.
 For


us,
 the
 growth
 fund
 is
 a
 fund
 that


invests
 in
 companies
 at
 the
 later
 stage


of
 their
 life
 cycle.
 So
 typically
 once


they
 found
 product
 market
 fit
 and
 our


early
 stage
 funds
 invest
 in
 companies


early
 stage
 when
 they're
 kind
 of
 trying


to
 find
 product
 market
 fit.
 We
 invest
 in


companies
 once
 they
 have
 found
 product


market
 fit.
 So
 that's
 the
 delineation.


Right
 now
 we're
 investing
 out
 of
 our


fifth
 growth
 fund.
 It's
 about
 a
 $7


billion
 fund.
 If
 you
 combine
 the


committed
 capital
 of
 our
 five
 funds
 it's


about
 $22
 billion
 in
 overall
 committed


capital.


>> Wow.
 What
 percentage
 of
 the
 growth
 fund


is
 sort
 of
 directly
 obtained
 from
 the


early
 stage
 funds?
 Because
 I
 imagine


that's
 like
 that's
 a
 good
 pipeline
 for


you
 guys,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 great
 pipeline
 for
 us.
 We


do
 both.
 So,
 we
 have
 examples
 of


investments
 out
 of
 the
 early
 stage
 and


in
 companies
 that
 for
 whatever
 reason
 we


were
 not
 early
 stage
 investors.
 So,
 some


of
 our
 largest
 investments
 in
 the
 growth


fund
 are
 are
 companies
 like
 Data
 Bricks


and
 Stripe
 that
 we
 were
 early
 stage


investors
 in.
 And
 then
 some
 of the


largest
 investments
 are
 companies
 like


SpaceX
 and
 OpenAI
 and
 Whimo
 and
 Roblox


and
 Figma
 that
 we
 were
 not
 early
 stage


investors
 in.
 And
 the
 first
 time
 that
 we


invested
 was
 in
 the
 growth
 fund.
 So
 it's


about
 50/50.
 We
 love
 to
 invest
 in


companies
 where
 we
 know
 the
 founders


really
 well.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 we
 talk


about
 all
 the
 time
 is
 game
 film.
 This
 is


something
 that
 public
 market
 investors


are
 very
 familiar
 with.
 They
 look
 for


game
 film.
 They
 want
 to
 back
 CEOs,


management
 teams
 that
 have
 demonstrated


continued
 success.
 and
 and
 we
 seek
 to
 do


the
 same
 thing
 in
 the
 private
 markets.


>> I
 like
 how
 Andre
 Horowitz
 is
 so


influential
 and
 dominant
 that
 if
 you


just


>> name
 a
 bunch
 of
 random
 big
 companies


that
 are
 all
 sort
 of
 like
 the
 most


important
 like
 growing
 tech
 companies,


they're
 actually
 just
 going
 to
 all
 be,


you
 know,
 like
 when
 I
 said
 SpaceX,
 Dick,


Stripe,
 etc.
 I
 didn't
 purposely
 say
 name


try
 to
 name
 a
 bunch
 of
 A6Z
 family


companies.
 They
 just
 incidentally


happened
 to
 me.
 What
 do
 you
 like?
 Let's


start
 big
 picture
 with
 this
 question
 of


companies
 staying
 private
 for
 longer


especially
 thriving
 companies
 companies


that
 are
 doing
 very
 well
 IPOing
 if
 at


all
 much
 later
 in
 their
 life
 cycle
 there


are
 a
 lot
 of
 specific
 questions
 but
 big


picture
 what's
 the
 story
 what's
 the
 main


cause
 of
 this
 the
 evolution
 of
 this


trend


>> yeah
 absolutely
 well
 first
 I
 would
 love


to
 just
 set
 the
 stage
 with
 what
 the
 what


the
 data
 actually
 is
 like
 what's


actually
 happened


>> if
 I'm
 totally
 wrong
 that's
 also


interesting


>> no
 no
 you're
 not
 totally
 wrong.
 I
 have
 a


bunch
 of
 supporting
 facts
 to
 your


statement,
 but
 the
 numbers
 are
 pretty


eyepopping.
 So,
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


private
 markets,
 highly
 valued


technology
 companies
 represent
 about
 $5


trillion
 of
 market
 cap
 in
 the
 private


markets.
 That's
 almost
 a
 quarter
 of the


S&P
 500.


>> Wow.


>> It's
 15%
 of
 the
 NASDAQ.
 It's
 40%
 if
 you


exclude
 the
 MAG
 7.
 So,
 it's
 just


staggering
 numbers.
 To
 your
 point
 about


some
 of
 the
 biggest
 and
 best
 companies


in
 the
 world
 being
 in
 the
 private


markets,
 the
 10
 largest
 private


companies
 represent
 40%
 of
 that
 five


trillion
 of
 market
 cap.


>> So
 this
 is
 a
 massive
 power
 law
 game
 and


the
 best
 of
 the
 best
 companies
 at
 that


stage
 of
 their
 life
 cycle
 just
 happen
 to


be
 in
 the
 private
 markets
 and
 not
 in
 the


public
 markets
 right
 now.
 That
 private


market
 kind
 of
 five
 trillion
 of
 market


cap
 that
 sector
 of
 the
 economy
 has
 grown


10x
 in
 10
 years.
 At
 the
 same
 time,
 the


number
 of
 public
 companies,
 you
 guys


have
 probably
 covered
 this
 before,
 the


number
 of
 public
 companies
 has
 been
 cut


in
 half
 over
 the
 last
 20
 years.
 So,
 this


is
 just
 a
 massive
 shift
 in
 the


composition
 of
 the
 public
 markets
 and


the
 private
 markets.
 And
 the
 best
 of
 the


best
 companies,
 as
 you
 said,
 largely
 are


sitting
 in
 the
 private
 markets
 today.


The
 other
 thing
 that
 we
 look
 for,
 you


know,
 we're
 a
 growth
 fund,
 but
 growth


means
 a
 lot
 of
 things.
 We
 look
 for


companies
 that
 are
 growing,
 you
 know,


sort
 of
 hyperrowth.
 We
 call
 it


hyperrowth.
 Growing
 very
 very
 fast.
 You


know
 the
 average
 investment
 in
 our


growth
 fund
 is
 growing
 about
 100%.
 If


you
 look
 at
 the
 public
 markets
 today,


there's
 only
 three
 companies
 in
 our


universe
 that
 are
 growing
 over
 30%.


>> So
 if
 you
 actually
 want
 to
 invest
 in
 the


highest
 growth,
 most
 promising
 companies


that
 could
 be
 that
 next
 mag
 seven,


chances
 are
 they're
 in
 the
 private


market.
 So
 this
 is
 this
 is
 just
 a
 big


shift
 in
 the
 dynamics,
 you
 know,


certainly
 in
 the
 last
 20
 years,
 but
 even


the
 last
 10
 or
 15.
 So
 that's
 the
 numbers


behind
 the
 trend.
 The
 question
 is
 why.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 know
 there's
 there's
 lots
 of


reasons
 why
 this
 is
 the
 case.
 I
 mean
 you


mentioned
 it
 right
 at
 the
 outset.
 There


are
 structural
 reasons
 in
 the
 public


markets
 that
 make
 it
 harder
 to
 be
 a


public
 company
 now
 than
 it
 was
 20
 years


ago.
 I
 think
 the
 biggest
 thing
 is
 the


private
 capital
 markets
 are
 deeper
 and


more
 liquid
 than
 before.
 So
 there's
 less


of
 a
 need
 for
 a
 company
 to
 go
 public


until
 they
 need
 much
 much
 much
 more


capital.
 in
 the
 private
 markets
 for
 the


best
 of
 the
 best
 companies.
 They
 kind
 of


have
 the
 access
 to
 the
 capital
 that
 they


need.
 It's
 a
 pretty
 compelling
 pitch
 for


the
 founder
 to
 be
 able
 to
 stay
 in
 the


private
 markets,
 have
 liquidity
 over


time.
 If
 you're
 one
 of
 a
 select
 few
 that


can
 access
 capital,
 you
 know,
 in
 the


private
 markets
 cheaply,
 you
 can
 kind
 of


steadily
 control
 the
 stock
 price


movements.
 You
 can
 regularly
 run
 tender


offers.
 And,
 you
 know,
 for
 a
 company,


probably
 the
 hardest
 thing
 aside
 from


access
 to
 capital
 is
 employee


management.
 And
 if
 you
 can
 get
 pretty


close
 to
 the
 dynamics
 that
 you
 get
 in


the
 public
 markets
 without
 volatility,


it's
 pretty
 compelling
 to
 remain
 in
 the


private
 markets.


>> So
 I
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 questions
 on
 just


the
 growth
 of
 private
 capital.
 But


before
 we
 get
 to
 that,
 you
 said
 there


are
 structural
 challenges
 in
 going


public.
 And
 I
 guess
 the
 one
 we
 always


hear
 is
 like,
 oh,
 you
 have
 to
 file


quarterly
 paperwork.
 Like
 not
 the


paperwork,
 which
 I
 actually
 sympathize


with
 because
 I
 hate
 filling
 out
 forms


and
 things
 like
 that.
 But
 like
 what
 are


the
 reasons
 that
 the
 public
 market
 is


perceived
 to
 be
 so
 much
 more
 difficult


or
 so
 much
 more
 of
 a
 operational


headache
 I
 guess
 than
 private?


>> Well,
 there
 is
 a
 cost.
 So,
 you
 know,
 for


a
 company
 the
 size
 of
 SpaceX
 or
 or
 Data


Bricks
 or
 Open
 Air
 or
 Stripe,
 you
 know,


it's
 not
 hugely
 meaningful,
 but
 for
 a


smaller
 company,
 you
 know,
 it
 could
 be


10
 to
 20
 million
 bucks.
 And
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 a
 company
 that
 would
 have
 gone


public
 15
 years
 ago,
 you
 know,
 5
 years


into
 your
 life
 doing
 100
 million
 bucks


of
 revenue,
 that's
 pretty
 meaningful.


Like
 that's
 a
 major
 change.
 And
 so


you'll
 want
 to
 wait
 longer.
 Public


markets,
 investors,
 investment
 banks,


research
 organizations
 are
 tilted
 much


more
 toward
 large
 cap
 companies
 or
 at


least
 midsize
 companies
 today
 and
 and


less
 so
 towards
 small
 cap.
 So
 if
 you're


a
 small
 cap
 company,
 it's
 just
 very
 hard


to
 get
 the
 attention
 of
 investors.
 you


know,
 they
 they
 can't
 write
 very
 large


checks
 and
 build
 huge
 positions
 in
 you.


You
 know,
 it
 may
 not
 be
 worth
 the


investment
 bank's
 time
 or
 the
 research


analyst
 time
 to
 cover
 you.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 if
 that's
 the
 case,
 it's
 hard
 to


get
 the
 attention
 of
 good
 investors
 and


make
 your
 stock
 price
 grow
 over
 time.


Uh,
 so
 those
 are
 a
 couple
 examples
 of


the
 structural
 challenges.
 You
 know,
 the


other
 one
 is
 just
 volatility.
 You
 know,


this
 generation
 of
 founders
 has
 seen
 the


2021
 runup
 and
 then
 the
 certainly
 in
 the


technology
 market
 and
 and
 then
 the


fall-off
 in
 22
 and
 23
 and
 some
 of
 them


have
 reset
 their
 stock
 prices
 in
 the


private
 markets.
 But
 that
 was
 a
 volatile


time.
 Like
 if
 you
 were
 issuing
 stock
 to


an
 employee
 at
 the
 peak
 and
 then
 you


know
 that
 employee
 was
 looking
 at
 their


stock
 grants
 and
 saying,
 "Oh
 my
 gosh,


these
 are
 down
 70%."
 Like
 my
 comp
 just


got
 cut
 by
 70%.
 That's
 a
 hard
 dynamic


for
 a
 founder
 to
 have
 to
 deal
 with.
 And


if
 you
 can
 minimize
 some
 of
 that


volatility
 in
 the
 private
 markets
 as
 a


founder,
 I
 understand
 why
 you
 would
 do


it.


>> Talk
 to
 us
 about
 employee
 retention,


employee
 management.
 Employees,
 you


know,
 they
 love
 an
 IPO.
 They
 love


liquidity
 and
 okay,
 now
 you
 can
 have


tender
 offers
 where
 they
 sell
 some
 of


their
 stock
 to
 new
 investors.
 And
 then


there's
 other
 dynamics
 too
 like
 because


there's
 all
 the
 SPVS
 out
 there
 and
 maybe


like
 tokens
 where
 someone
 can
 hedge


their
 holdings
 in
 a
 private
 market
 on


hyperlquid
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 Talk


to
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the
 sort
 of
 the


plethora
 of
 options
 that
 employees
 have


now
 in
 a
 private
 companies
 and
 getting


that
 uh
 liquidity
 and
 so
 they
 actually


get
 some
 real
 money.


>> Let
 me
 start
 by
 just
 explaining
 the
 way


it
 works
 in
 the
 public
 markets
 and
 you


know
 we
 can
 contrast
 the
 private
 markets


with
 that.
 If
 you're
 a
 public
 market


employee
 and
 you
 have
 RSU
 grants,
 this


is
 basically
 the
 way
 it
 works.
 You
 get
 a


quarterly
 deposit
 of
 net
 stock,
 net
 of


taxes
 in
 your
 account
 every
 quarter.
 And


so
 if
 you're
 a
 highly
 paid
 employee
 at


>> Meta
 or
 Alphabet
 or
 Apple,


>> it's
 like
 clockwork.
 You
 get
 these


grants,
 they
 hit
 your
 account,
 you
 have


for
 some
 of the
 highest
 paid
 people,
 you


know,
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 or
 millions


of
 dollars
 that
 hit
 your
 hit
 your


account
 every
 quarter.
 And
 that's


liquid.
 It's
 already
 netted
 of
 tax.
 And


so
 you
 can
 turn
 around
 and
 sell
 it
 and


it's
 like
 cash
 comp.
 Or
 in
 the
 case
 of


those
 companies,
 they've
 appreciated


tremendously
 in
 value
 over
 the
 last
 10


years.
 And
 so
 the
 employees,
 you
 know,


who
 help
 stock
 have
 been
 handsomely


rewarded.
 Then
 they
 get
 RSU
 grants


stacked
 on
 top
 of
 those.
 So
 you
 kind
 of


have
 this
 like
 waterfall
 of
 RSU
 grants


over
 time
 and
 increasingly,
 you
 know,


over
 time
 your
 quarterly
 net
 deposit
 can


go
 up.
 And
 so
 if
 you're
 a
 private
 CEO


competing
 for
 talent,
 that's
 what
 you're


competing
 with,


>> right?


>> And
 those
 companies
 are
 are
 flushed
 with


cash.
 And
 so
 they're
 able
 to
 pay
 a
 lot


in
 stockbased
 comp
 to
 their
 employees.


And
 so
 that's
 a
 difficult
 dynamic
 to


compete
 with.
 That's
 one
 of
 the


strongest
 forms
 of
 the
 argument
 for


telling
 a
 private
 company
 CEO
 that
 they


should
 go
 public
 because
 that
 is
 a
 very


compelling
 financial
 reward
 for
 your


employees
 in
 that
 public
 market


situation.
 In
 the
 private
 markets,
 the


way
 it
 typically
 works
 is
 you
 get,
 you


know,
 you
 get
 these
 RSU
 grants.


Sometimes
 they
 stack
 up
 over
 time,
 but


generally
 they're
 illquid
 until
 you
 go


public.
 Now,
 what's
 happened
 over
 the


last,
 I'd
 say,
 six
 or
 eight
 years
 is


companies
 will
 do
 tender
 offers
 in
 the


private
 markets
 where
 they
 offer
 to
 buy


a
 certain
 percentage
 of
 employees
 vested


stock
 in
 the
 private
 markets.
 So
 they'll


set
 the
 price.
 They'll
 work
 with


somebody
 like
 us
 and
 they'll
 say


something
 like,
 "Hey,
 you
 can
 sell
 25%


of
 your
 vested
 stock
 that
 you
 have
 in


this
 tender
 offer
 and
 you
 know,
 we'll
 do


it
 once
 a
 year."
 And
 so
 that's
 a
 decent


substitute
 for
 what
 I
 described
 in
 the


public
 markets.
 It's
 not
 a
 perfect


substitute,
 but
 for
 you
 know,
 the


employees
 or
 potential
 new
 hires
 who
 are


true
 believers,
 I
 think
 it's
 enough
 to


combat
 that
 RSU
 public
 market
 dynamic


and
 compensation
 scheme.
 And
 you
 know,


it's
 worked
 pretty
 well.
 SpaceX
 has,
 you


know,
 famously
 done
 a
 really
 good
 job


running
 twice
 a
 year
 tender
 offers
 for


their
 employees.
 And,
 you
 know,
 they've


had
 tremendous
 employee
 satisfaction,


ability
 to
 hire,
 retention,
 etc.
 And


some
 of
 the
 biggest
 tech
 companies
 have


followed
 suit.
 And
 I
 would
 argue
 that


there's
 a
 trade-off
 that
 the
 founders
 in


the
 private
 markets
 are
 making
 where


often
 if
 they
 were
 public,
 they
 probably


would
 have
 a
 higher
 stock
 price.
 So


maybe
 they're
 taking
 a
 little
 bit
 more


dilution
 and
 so
 maybe
 employees
 would


benefit
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 in
 valuation


in
 the
 public
 markets,
 but
 it's
 not
 a


massive
 gap
 and
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 pretty


compelling
 alternative

just
 culturally
 out
 in
 San
 Francisco.
 Do


people
 still
 expect
 like
 the
 default


exit
 to
 be
 an
 IPO
 or
 has
 that
 mindset


kind
 of
 gone
 away?


>> The
 best
 of
 the
 best
 companies
 want
 to


IPO
 and
 I
 think
 you
 mentioned
 some
 of


the
 the
 bigname
 companies
 out
 there
 who


may
 stay
 private
 for
 a
 really
 long
 time.


You
 know,
 I
 think
 the
 ambition
 for
 most


founders
 is
 still,
 you
 know,
 to
 have
 an


IPO
 and
 to
 be
 a
 large
 established


important
 public
 company.
 You
 know,
 we


talked
 about
 the
 pools
 of
 private


capital
 and
 how
 they've
 grown
 over
 the


last
 10
 years.
 the
 pools
 of
 capital
 in


the
 public
 markets
 are
 still
 much


deeper.
 So
 if
 you
 need
 to
 raise
 50,


100,200
 billion
 dollars
 like
 some
 of
 the


big
 big
 companies
 may
 want
 to
 do
 to


pursue
 some
 of
 their
 goals,
 chances
 are


they'll
 end
 up
 in
 the
 public
 markets.


>> Part
 of
 the
 reason
 we
 wanted
 to
 have


this
 conversation
 a
 few
 months
 ago,


Tracy
 and
 I
 interviewed
 the
 Perplexity


CEO
 and
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 the
 rise
 of


SPVS
 and
 wanting
 to
 say
 no
 to
 money.
 you


know,
 people
 come
 to
 him
 with
 investment


opportunities
 and
 then
 it's
 clear
 that


they
 just
 want
 to
 package
 up
 that
 equity


in
 some
 way
 and
 create
 a
 secondary


instrument.
 And
 I
 know,
 you
 know what,


someone
 messaged
 me
 recently
 and
 they're


like,
 I
 could
 get
 you
 some
 preipo


anthropic
 shares.
 I'm
 like,
 no,
 I
 don't


do
 that.
 But
 like,
 I
 know
 that
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 interest
 in
 there.
 And
 you


mentioned
 that
 if
 you
 really
 want


massive
 growth
 at
 this
 level
 that
 it's


the
 only
 ones
 that
 growing
 super
 big
 are


the
 private
 companies.
 Talk
 to
 us
 about


the
 emergence
 of
 SPVS
 and
 these


third-party
 entities
 and
 you
 don't
 even


know
 who's
 on
 your
 cap
 table
 and
 how


founders
 are
 thinking
 about
 this


phenomenon.


>> I
 think
 founders
 for
 the
 most
 part


really
 don't
 like
 it.


>> Okay.


>> Because
 they
 they
 want
 to
 know
 who
 is
 on


their
 cap
 table
 and
 there
 are
 certain


types
 of
 investors
 who
 will
 come
 to
 the


founders
 and
 misrepresent
 I
 think
 what


what
 vehicle
 or
 or
 where
 the
 capital
 is


actually
 going
 to
 come
 from.
 In
 our


case,
 we
 don't
 do
 those.
 What
 what
 we
 do


is
 we
 invest
 directly
 out
 of
 our
 funds


and


>> you
 know
 we
 we
 make
 that
 a
 point
 of


pride
 with
 the
 founders
 to
 say
 hey
 you


know
 exactly
 what
 you're
 getting
 we're


going
 to
 shoot
 you
 straight


>> for
 the
 SPB
 industry


>> you
 know
 look
 it
 works
 when
 you
 know


times
 are
 good
 and
 it
 can
 be
 horrendous


and
 and
 bad
 you
 know
 when
 when
 times
 are


bad
 you
 know
 and
 is
 one
 of
 our
 companies


very
 close
 with
 we're
 one
 of
 the
 largest


investors


>> and
 they
 have
 famously
 you
 know
 gone
 to


war
 with
 some
 of
 the
 SPV
 husters
 who
 are


trying
 to
 assemble
 capital
 to
 do
 a
 deal


through
 some
 obfuscated
 way
 around
 them


and
 they
 say,
 "Look,
 we
 want
 to
 know


exactly
 who's
 on
 our
 cap
 table.
 You


know,
 we
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we're


doing
 right
 by
 our
 shareholders."
 And


so,
 it's
 a
 risky
 maneuver.
 You
 know,


it's
 not
 to
 say
 that
 there's
 not
 some


that
 that
 are
 good,
 but
 we
 try
 to
 avoid


it.
 We
 try
 to
 counsel
 our
 founders
 to


stay
 away
 from
 it
 as
 much
 as
 possible.


So
 you
 mentioned
 Anderoll
 and
 can


founders
 completely
 lock
 them
 out
 or


like
 how
 does
 it
 work
 such
 that
 the


founder
 doesn't
 want
 to
 have
 these


vehicles
 get
 access
 to
 their
 equity
 and


yet
 somehow
 they
 do
 anyway?
 What
 is
 the


path
 into
 the
 company
 that
 these


entities
 are
 taking?


>> The
 example
 would
 be
 a
 fund
 shows
 up
 to


the
 founder
 and
 says,
 "Yeah,
 we're
 going


to
 invest
 out
 of
 this
 fund."
 And
 they


have
 some
 legal
 entity
 name
 that
 they


have
 as
 the
 fund.
 And
 then
 it's
 not


fully
 clear
 to
 the
 founder
 that
 that


legal
 entity
 actually
 will
 just
 be
 an


assembly
 of
 a
 bunch
 of
 new
 investors


that
 are
 only
 investing
 in
 that
 single


vehicle.
 I
 would
 say
 the
 SPV
 interest,


there's
 one
 other,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of


additional
 risk
 that
 comes
 with
 it.


>> You
 know,
 our
 large
 investors,
 RLPs,


they're
 some
 of
 the
 largest
 institutions


in
 the
 world.
 They
 trust
 us
 to
 make


investments
 and
 they
 actually
 like
 the


fact
 that
 they're
 investing
 in
 a
 fund


that
 has
 some
 degree
 of
 diversification.


Yeah,


>> SPVS
 are
 inherently
 risky
 because


they're
 they're
 single
 company.
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 if
 that
 company
 happens
 to
 not


go
 well
 and
 you
 invest
 in
 A16Z's
 funds,


you
 can
 live
 to
 fight
 another
 day


because
 we
 have a
 number
 of
 other


companies
 that
 are
 going
 to
 going
 to
 do


really
 well.
 And
 at
 the
 fund
 level,
 the


returns
 will
 be
 good.
 In
 an
 SPV,
 if
 that


happens
 to
 not
 work
 for
 whatever
 reason,


you
 know,
 it
 could
 be
 devastating
 if
 if


you
 put
 a
 large
 amount
 of
 capital
 into


it.
 talk
 to
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 about


pricing
 because
 something
 you
 tend
 to


hear
 is
 that
 well
 if
 you
 go
 to
 the


private
 market
 there
 are
 some
 benefits


to
 that
 but
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 you're


probably
 going
 to
 pay
 you
 know
 a
 little


bit
 more
 in
 terms
 of
 cost
 of
 capital
 and


then
 the
 other
 thing
 you
 hear
 is
 that


well
 if
 everything
 is
 private
 it's
 not


necessarily
 being
 marked
 to
 market
 as


often
 as
 the
 public
 market
 so
 maybe


there's
 some
 concern
 around
 pricing


you're
 not
 getting
 that
 wisdom
 of
 the


crowds
 effect
 you're
 just


a
 bunch
 of
 tech
 bros
 investing
 in
 tech


bros
 and
 that
 can
 kind
 of
 be
 a


self-reinforcing
 cycle.


>> Yeah,
 look,
 I
 I
 can
 only
 speak
 to
 our


own
 business
 that
 we're
 in.
 I'd
 make
 two


observations.
 One,
 I
 feel
 pretty


strongly
 that
 if
 you
 took
 our
 portfolio


and
 put
 it
 in
 the
 public
 markets,
 it


would
 trade
 higher
 than
 the,
 you
 know,


than
 the
 private
 markets.
 And
 so
 that


speaks
 to
 the,
 you
 know,
 cost
 of
 capital


trade-off
 that
 the
 founders
 are
 making.


It's
 benefited
 us
 tremendously
 because


we've
 been
 able
 to
 invest
 in
 companies


that
 we
 think
 are
 some
 of the
 best


companies
 in
 the
 world
 later
 into
 their


life
 cycle
 than
 you
 know
 we
 would
 have


been
 able
 to
 10
 years
 or
 so
 ago.


interesting
 data
 point.
 If
 you
 look
 at


the
 returns
 generated
 by
 dollars
 in
 the


private
 markets
 historically
 over
 the


last
 call
 it
 like
 seven
 years
 of
 good


IPOs


about
 50%
 of
 the
 dollars
 of
 gain
 in
 an


IPO
 come
 from
 the
 seed
 through
 series
 B


>> and
 then
 50%
 of
 the
 dollars
 of
 gain
 come


from
 the
 series
 C
 and
 later.
 as


companies
 have
 stayed
 private
 longer


that
 will
 massively
 shift
 to
 the
 series


C
 and
 later


>> and
 the
 seed
 through
 B
 will
 be
 you
 know


a
 smaller
 proportion
 of
 the
 dollars
 of


gain
 similarly
 if
 you
 go
 back
 10
 years


and
 you
 look
 at
 all
 the
 companies
 that


have
 gone
 public
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 of


like
 time
 lag
 in
 this
 so
 just
 just
 bear


with
 me
 so
 the
 best
 companies
 that
 were


going
 public
 10
 years
 ago
 generated
 88%


of
 their
 overall
 dollars
 of
 return
 in


the
 public
 markets
 so
 if
 you
 just
 took


total
 market
 cap
 creation
 only
 12%
 of
 it


was
 happening
 in
 the
 private
 markets.
 If


you
 look
 at
 the
 recent
 crop
 of
 IPOs
 in


the
 last
 5
 years,
 55%
 of
 their
 market


cap
 creation
 happened
 in
 the
 private


markets.
 Wow.


>> 45%
 happened
 in
 the
 public
 markets.
 So


there
 is
 a
 massive
 shift
 that's
 taken


place
 in
 terms
 of
 where
 value
 creation


happens.
 That's
 benefited
 us.


>> In
 terms
 of
 pricing,
 we've
 invested
 in
 a


portfolio
 of
 of
 great
 companies.
 I


listed
 all
 the
 some
 of
 our
 investments.


Some
 of
 our
 biggest
 investments
 are


companies
 like
 data
 bricks
 and
 spacex


and
 whimo
 and
 openai
 and
 you
 know
 and


stripe
 and
 flock
 safety
 and
 and


companies
 like
 that.
 If
 you
 take
 our


portfolio
 on
 average
 it's
 growing
 100%.


And
 we
 invested
 at
 21
 times
 revenue.


Now,
 I
 recognize
 there
 are
 flaws
 with


revenue
 multiples
 and
 all
 that,
 but
 I


would
 say
 if
 you
 could
 let
 me
 have
 a


career,
 an
 entire
 career
 of
 investing
 in


marketleading
 great
 technology
 companies


where
 we
 could
 buy
 them
 at
 21
 times


revenue
 and
 they're
 growing
 100%.
 That


would
 be
 an
 incredible
 trade
 or
 a


incredible
 investment
 opportunity.
 And


so
 in
 terms
 of
 valuations,
 I
 feel
 like


there
 is
 a
 discount
 to
 being
 in
 the


private
 markets
 and
 you
 know
 founders
 I


think
 understand
 that
 for
 the
 most
 part


and
 make
 that
 trade-off.
 But
 it's


definitely
 a
 dynamic
 that
 we
 see.


There's
 one
 more
 thing
 that
 I
 would
 call


out.
 You
 know
 I
 mentioned
 earlier
 that


only
 three
 companies
 in
 our
 universe
 in


the
 public
 markets
 are
 actually
 growing


greater
 than
 30%.


There
 is
 a
 dynamic
 where
 I
 do
 think
 it's


hard
 for
 public
 market
 investors
 even
 to


gro
 really really
 high
 growth
 rates.
 So


if
 you're
 growing
 like
 60%.


I
 think
 automatically
 a
 public
 market


investor
 is
 going
 to
 build
 a
 financial


model
 that
 says
 60
 50


20%.
 And
 then
 they're
 going
 to
 value
 you


as
 such.
 And
 then
 they'll
 pick
 an
 exit


multiple
 at
 year
 five
 and
 they'll
 apply


it
 to
 20%
 growth
 and
 they'll
 probably


say
 at
 that
 point
 you'll
 be
 20%
 margins


and
 they'll
 be
 happy
 and
 they'll
 call
 it


a
 day
 and
 they'll
 have
 your
 stock
 price


be
 that
 when
 in
 reality,
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 a
 great
 company,
 you
 know,
 like


data
 bricks
 that's
 still
 growing
 north


of
 60%.
 like
 you're
 worth
 probably
 3
 to


4x
 difference
 in
 value
 if
 you
 grow
 60%


55%
 52%
 48%
 45%
 like
 it's
 it's
 probably


like
 a
 3x
 or
 4x
 difference
 in
 how
 you're


valued
 and
 so
 I
 do
 think
 people
 like
 us


with
 a
 longer
 time
 horizon
 in
 the


private
 markets
 may
 have
 an
 easier
 time


of
 actually
 groing
 that
 very
 high
 growth


rate
 you
 know
 data
 bricks
 is
 growing
 65%


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 public
 markets
 you


know
 really
 only
 Palanteer
 is
 you
 a


software
 company
 that's
 growing
 that


fast.
 I
 think
 they're
 growing
 70%,


they're
 about
 the
 same
 size
 as
 data


bricks
 and
 their
 valuation
 multiple
 is


35
 times
 or
 or
 something
 like
 that.
 And


so
 that's
 the
 one
 example
 where
 maybe


public
 market
 investors
 are
 attributing


a
 really
 high
 valuation
 to
 very
 high


kind
 of
 hyper
 growth.
 But
 for
 the
 most


part,
 I
 think
 it's
 pretty
 hard
 for
 them


to
 gro
 that.
 And
 so
 again,
 you
 know,


when
 we
 have
 conversations
 with
 the


founders
 of
 the
 these
 companies
 in
 the


in
 the
 private
 markets,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 we
 understand
 it.
 I
 think
 we


understand
 multi-product
 and
 you're
 less


likely
 to
 find,
 you
 know,
 a
 full
 public


market
 of
 folks
 who
 will
 give
 you
 credit


for
 that
 hyperrowth.


>> I
 find
 this
 to
 be
 a
 very
 interesting


observation.
 I
 mean,
 just
 generally


public
 or
 private,
 it
 does
 seem
 like


several
 generations
 ago,
 you
 assume,


okay,
 here
 is
 a
 really
 big
 company.
 It's


not
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 the
 fastest


growing
 companies
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 you


apply
 that
 sort
 of
 model
 mindset
 where


you
 marked
 down
 their
 growth


expectations.
 I
 mean,
 even
 Alphabet,
 I


think
 in
 its
 latest
 quarter
 actually
 had


faster
 topline
 growth
 than
 it
 had
 in
 the


quarter
 before,
 like
 on
 a
 year-over-year


basis.
 So,
 setting
 aside
 public
 or


private,
 it
 does
 feel
 like
 there
 is
 just


this
 phenomenon
 where
 really
 gigantic


companies
 grow
 at
 shocking
 shocking


topline
 rates
 year
 after
 year
 in
 a
 way


that
 maybe
 even
 still
 investors
 might


not
 appreciate.
 I
 have a
 question
 for


you.
 Something
 I've
 always
 wondered.


Okay,
 let's
 say
 one
 of
 your
 big


portfolio
 companies
 goes
 public


eventually,
 you
 know,
 Stripe
 or


something
 like
 that.
 How
 does
 a
 GP
 or


how
 do
 how
 does
 the
 firm
 think
 about


selling
 at
 that
 point?
 Is
 it
 okay,


you're
 you're
 a
 private
 market
 investor,


so
 you
 get
 out
 fairly
 soon,
 you
 don't


want
 to
 hold
 that.
 Do
 they
 get


distributed
 and
 then
 it's
 up
 to
 the
 LPs


to
 think
 about
 it?
 What
 is
 the
 sell


decision
 like
 once
 a
 company
 is
 no


longer
 private?


>> Yeah,
 it's
 a
 great
 question.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 to
 your
 point
 on
 these
 large
 cap


high
 growth
 companies,


>> it's
 a
 really
 good
 learning
 for
 all
 of


us
 that
 the
 very
 best
 companies
 can,
 you


know,
 sort
 of
 defy
 your
 expectations
 and


still
 grow
 fast
 even
 though
 they're
 big.


Like
 it's
 sort
 of
 the
 breaking
 of
 the


law
 of
 the
 absolute
 size
 of
 a
 company.


Like
 Meta
 accelerated
 revenue
 growth
 to


30%
 the
 last
 quarter,


>> right?


>> Like
 that's
 shocking
 like
 that
 a
 company


that's
 worth,
 you
 know,
 almost
 $2


trillion
 can
 accelerate
 to
 30%
 growth.


Same
 with
 Google,
 north
 of
 20%
 growth.


So
 if
 you
 can
 find
 those
 opportunities,


I
 would
 say
 Stripe
 is
 a
 good
 example
 of


this.
 Previous
 generations
 of
 this
 would


be
 like
 Visa
 and
 Mastercard.
 Like
 if
 you


had
 a
 strong
 thesis
 that
 those
 would


grow
 at
 north
 of
 20%
 for
 15
 years,
 you


would
 value
 it
 a
 very
 different
 way
 than


if
 you
 thought
 that
 that
 growth
 would


tail
 off
 over
 time.
 So
 yeah,
 I
 think


it's
 great
 that
 you
 brought
 up
 Google


and
 and
 you
 know,
 we
 think
 about
 the


large
 cap
 companies
 to
 try
 and
 inform


what
 could
 go
 right
 with
 the
 best
 of
 the


best,
 the
 companies
 in
 the
 private


markets
 for
 us
 too,
 not
 just
 over
 five


years,
 but
 over
 10
 plus
 years.
 So
 to


your
 question
 about
 distributions
 or


selling,
 when
 our
 companies
 go
 public,


our
 LPs,
 our
 investors
 tend
 to
 like
 to


have
 distributions
 as
 opposed
 to
 us


selling.


>> Okay?
 you
 know,
 many
 of
 them
 have
 public


desks
 or
 public
 operations
 on
 their
 own


and
 they
 would
 prefer
 to
 take
 the
 stock


and,
 you
 know,
 manage
 tax
 consequences


on
 their
 own
 or
 or
 maybe
 they
 have,
 you


know,
 a
 long
 book
 that
 wants
 to
 hold
 it.


>> And
 so,
 you
 know,
 we
 tend
 to
 distribute


companies.
 I
 would
 say
 for
 the
 most
 part


when
 our
 companies
 go
 public,
 I'll
 speak


from
 the
 growth
 fund,
 you
 know,
 where


we're
 coming
 in
 at
 a
 more
 mature
 stage


of
 the
 company.
 Just
 because
 a
 company


goes
 public
 doesn't
 mean
 that
 we
 will


exit.
 Now,
 we
 always
 seek
 to
 return


capital
 to
 our
 LPs
 and
 we
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 we're
 doing
 that
 on


appropriate
 time
 horizon,
 but
 often,
 you


know,
 we'll
 find
 situations
 in
 the


public
 markets
 where
 we
 think
 our


companies
 are
 are
 massively
 undervalued.


You
 know,
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example.
 One


of
 our
 best
 companies
 was
 company
 called


Samsara,
 which
 does
 fleet
 management,


video
 tracking
 for
 drivers.
 They're
 the


market
 leader,
 second
 time
 founders.


They
 were
 the
 founders
 of
 Moroi,
 which


sold
 to
 Cisco.
 So,
 they're
 an


exceptional
 team,
 doing
 great.
 They
 went


public
 right
 at
 the
 tail
 end
 of
 2021


and
 the
 IPO
 market
 was
 starting
 to


freeze
 and
 they
 were
 the
 last
 IPO
 and
 so


we
 ended
 up
 being
 the
 largest
 buyer
 in


their
 IPO.
 So
 all
 of
 the
 public
 funds


you
 know
 Fidelity
 Tro
 some
 of
 them


invested
 we
 ended
 up
 actually
 being
 the


biggest
 buyer
 and
 then
 we
 held
 that
 for


a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 even
 though
 it
 was


in
 the
 public
 markets.
 So
 we'd
 like
 to


think
 about,
 you
 know,
 what
 is
 the


future
 of
 the
 company
 even
 if
 they're
 in


the
 public
 markets
 and
 we
 would
 bias
 to


hold
 it
 a
 little
 bit
 longer
 if
 the


founders
 still
 running
 the
 company.
 We


place
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of
 value
 in


founders
 running
 companies,
 which
 I'm


happy
 to
 talk
 about.
 And
 if
 we
 think
 the


the
 growth
 prospects
 are
 really
 bright,


you
 know,
 we'll
 we'll
 tend
 to
 sort
 of


buy
 to
 hold
 a
 little
 bit
 longer.


>> What's
 the
 actual
 catalyst
 for
 going


public
 then?
 Because
 if
 we
 think
 there's


plenty
 of
 capital
 in
 the
 private


markets,
 employees
 are,
 you
 know,


generally
 pretty
 happy
 with
 their


compensation,


people
 can
 live
 with
 the
 capital
 cost.


Why
 would
 you
 go
 public
 or
 like
 what's


the
 most
 common
 reason
 in
 terms
 of


timing?
 Yeah,
 the
 biggest
 thing
 would
 be


access
 to
 larger
 pools
 of
 capital
 and


you
 know
 you
 finally
 feel
 like
 you're


making
 that
 tradeoff
 where
 the
 cost
 of


capital
 in
 the
 public
 markets
 would
 just


be
 much
 more
 attractive
 and
 so
 you
 want


to
 go
 do
 it
 there.
 So
 in
 the
 case
 of


building
 for
 example
 data
 centers
 in


space
 yeah


>> that
 will
 require
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of


capital
 over
 time
 you
 know
 you
 can
 get
 a


lot
 of
 that
 capital
 in
 the
 private


markets
 and
 you
 know
 maybe
 at
 some
 point


it
 makes
 sense
 to
 tap
 the
 public
 markets


to
 get
 that
 you
 know
 if
 you
 have
 huge


ambitions
 sometimes
 it's
 easier
 to
 get


debt
 um
 and
 alternative
 forms
 of


financing
 in
 the
 public
 markets
 as
 well


and
 then
 lastly
 you
 know
 if
 you
 feel


like
 the
 competition
 is
 really
 fierce


for
 your
 employees
 and
 you
 know
 I


described
 that
 dynamic
 of
 you
 know


quarterly
 RSU
 use
 and
 you
 know
 stock


currency
 that
 might
 be
 a
 little
 bit


easier
 to
 manage
 in
 the
 public
 markets.


That
 would
 be
 another
 reason.
 It's
 not


just
 employees.
 It's
 also
 if
 you
 want
 to


do
 meaningful
 M&A,
 you
 know,
 there's


probably
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 benefit
 to


being
 in
 the
 public
 markets
 and
 having
 a


public
 currency
 that
 you
 can
 use
 where,


you
 know,
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 debate
 with


the
 sellers
 what
 the
 value
 of
 your


equity
 is
 because
 it's
 in
 the
 public


markets.
 You
 know,
 there's
 a
 there's


[music]
 a
 daily
 stock
 price.
 So,
 those


are
 a
 few
 of
 the
 dynamics.


>> [music]


[music]


[music]


>> Does
 the
 private
 market
 trend
 does
 that


hold
 as
 we
 see
 you
 know
 more
 and
 more


tech
 is
 just
 about
 AI
 right
 and
 if


there's
 one
 thing
 we
 know
 about
 AI
 it's


that
 it
 requires
 quite
 a
 lot
 of
 capital


investment
 so
 does
 that
 start
 to
 change


the
 dynamics
 or
 the
 balance
 of
 power


between
 private
 and
 public
 in
 your
 mind.


It
 goes
 back
 to
 the
 same
 point
 which
 is


at
 some
 point
 you
 know
 the
 amount
 of


capital
 required
 it
 probably
 makes
 sense


you
 know
 to
 be
 in
 the
 public
 markets
 you


know
 I
 do
 think
 for
 largescale
 consumer


businesses
 I
 think
 there's
 some
 value
 in


being
 in
 the
 public
 markets
 you
 know


letting
 retail
 take
 part
 in
 the


ownership
 of
 your
 stock
 you
 know
 having


greater
 brand
 recognition
 you
 know
 we
 we


saw
 this
 recently
 on
 the
 B2B
 side
 as


well
 with
 one
 of
 our
 public
 companies


and
 after
 going
 public
 you
 know


sometimes
 there's
 sort
 of
 a
 brand


benefit
 that
 you
 get
 brand
 halo
 you're


better
 known
 you
 know
 an
 IT
 buyer
 trusts


a
 little bit
 more
 in
 your
 future
 so


there
 are
 some
 of
 those
 dynamics
 that


exist
 you
 know
 AI
 first
 of
 all
 I
 think


these
 have
 the
 potential
 to
 be
 some
 of


the
 best
 businesses
 ever
 created
 they're


run
 by
 exceptional
 founders
 they're


building
 products
 that
 have
 grown
 at


rates
 that
 we've
 never
 ever
 seen
 before


so
 you
 know
 they're
 kind
 of
 speed


running
 the
 process
 of
 company
 growth
 in


a
 way
 getting
 to
 be
 bigger
 and
 more


consequential
 much
 much
 faster
 than
 the


previous
 generation


of
 companies.
 So,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 that


means
 they
 should
 be
 in
 the
 public


markets
 a
 little
 bit
 faster,
 too.


>> Maybe
 last
 year
 at
 some
 point,
 Open
 AI


had
 a
 big
 tender
 and
 then
 suddenly
 no


one
 could
 afford
 to
 buy
 a
 house
 again
 in


San
 Francisco
 because
 all
 that
 money


went
 into
 real
 estate.
 But
 I
 there's
 a


serious
 question
 actually
 and
 it's


particularly
 acute
 at
 the
 AI
 companies.


Is
 there
 any
 stigma
 of
 being
 an
 employee


who
 sells
 some
 of
 their
 shares?
 It's


like,
 all
 right,
 you
 can
 sell
 25%
 of


your
 shares
 and
 then
 it's
 like,
 I
 want


to
 sell.
 It's
 like
 what?
 You
 don't


believe
 in
 the
 singularity?
 You
 don't


believe
 that
 we're
 on
 the
 path
 to
 AGI.


You
 don't
 think
 you
 think
 we're
 done


with
 our
 you
 think
 we're
 almost
 at
 the


end
 of
 our
 mission
 and
 that
 our
 value


won't
 be
 10.
 Is
 that
 like
 is
 there
 any


anxiety
 on
 the
 part
 of
 employees
 at
 a


real
 like
 missiondriven
 fast
 growth


company
 of
 like
 I
 want
 to
 dip
 my
 toe
 in


the
 water.
 I
 want
 to
 hedge
 a
 little
 bit.


I
 want
 to
 hedge
 my
 own
 company.
 I
 want


to
 diversify
 away
 from
 my
 own
 company.


>> Suddenly
 the
 founder
 isn't
 playing
 ping


pong
 with
 you
 anymore.


>> Exactly.
 Is
 there


>> Yeah.
 Exactly.
 Yeah.
 You're
 not
 allowed


to
 have
 lunch
 in
 the
 cafeteria
 anymore.


>> I
 would
 feel
 like
 this
 would
 be
 a
 real


phenomenon.
 I
 would
 be
 anxious
 about


raising
 my
 hand.
 Yeah,


>> I
 think
 everything
 in
 moderation.
 Most


of
 the
 time
 there's
 not
 like
 a
 stigma


and
 most
 of
 the
 time
 it's
 not,


>> you
 know,
 an
 opportunity
 to
 sell
 so
 much


stock
 that
 it
 would
 be
 a
 vote
 of
 lack
 of


confidence,
 if
 you
 will,
 right?
 You


know,
 if
 it's
 25%
 of
 your
 vested
 stock


and
 you've
 been
 there
 for
 two
 years,


that
 means
 you
 probably
 have
 a
 ton
 of


unvested
 stock.
 And
 so,
 you're
 talking


about
 a
 small
 proportion
 of
 your
 overall


holdings,
 right?
 you
 know,
 we
 never


really
 see
 a
 chance
 for
 employees
 to


it's
 never
 designed
 that
 way
 where


employees
 say,
 "Oh
 my
 gosh,
 I'm
 out.
 I


want
 to
 sell
 100%
 of
 my
 stock."
 In
 fact,


you
 know,
 we
 don't
 have
 data
 on
 this,


but
 I
 would
 suspect
 that
 in
 the
 public


markets,
 you
 know,
 employees
 are


probably
 selling
 out
 of
 their
 stock


grants
 at
 a
 higher
 rate
 than
 in
 the


private
 markets.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 if
 you're
 if


you're
 at
 one
 of
 these
 companies
 in
 the


private
 markets,
 you
 probably
 have
 a


greater
 degree
 of
 confidence.
 You
 know,


if
 you're
 a
 good
 employee,
 you
 could
 you


could
 always
 go
 to
 Google
 or
 Facebook
 or


Meta
 and
 and
 clip
 coupons.
 But
 I
 think


that
 most
 of
 the
 time
 the
 good
 ones
 are


true
 believers.
 We
 do
 have
 companies


where
 the
 founders
 my
 one
 of
 my
 favorite


things
 is
 when
 the
 founders
 just
 say
 I'm


not
 selling
 a
 share.
 And
 you
 know
 that


is
 like
 the
 ultimate
 extreme
 point
 of


confidence.
 We
 spent
 time
 with
 a
 very


high-profile
 internet
 CEO
 of
 the


previous
 generation.
 It's
 now
 a
 public


company.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 meetings
 we
 were


talking
 to
 him
 about
 secondary
 and
 he


was
 so
 resolute.
 He
 was
 like
 I'm
 not


selling
 a
 share.
 Like
 why
 would
 I
 sell
 a


single
 share?
 like
 I
 I'm
 so
 confident


it's
 going
 to
 go
 up,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 do


that
 at
 all.
 And
 that's
 a
 pretty
 strong


signal
 of
 confidence
 in
 the
 future
 of


the
 company.
 So,
 we
 look
 for
 some
 of


those
 signals
 when
 we
 invest.
 You
 know,


my
 my
 partner
 Alex
 Rmpelle
 wrote
 a
 good


piece
 many
 years
 ago
 to
 your
 point
 on


real
 estate
 and
 buying
 a
 house
 and


affordability.


>> Yeah.
 that
 showed
 Bay
 Area
 stock
 prices,


you
 know,
 of
 like
 the
 mega
 cap
 stocks


indexed
 against
 home
 values
 and
 it's


like
 perfectly
 correlated.
 Yeah.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 home
 price
 appreciation
 is


kind
 of
 tethered
 to
 the
 local
 economy
 in


a
 way
 and
 so,
 you
 know,
 it's
 not
 totally


surprising
 that
 you
 see
 you
 see
 it
 move


in
 that
 direction.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 there
 are


a
 lot
 of
 people
 in
 San
 Francisco
 right


now
 who
 are
 excited
 about
 making
 money


off
 of
 AI
 and
 some
 of
 them
 have
 been


doing
 so
 already.
 But
 on
 that
 note,
 how


are
 you
 actually
 differentiating
 between


AI
 models?
 I
 guess
 like
 this
 is
 a
 way
 of


asking
 how
 are
 you
 cutting
 through
 the


hype
 because
 we
 see
 all
 these
 new


companies
 launching.
 A
 lot
 of
 them
 use


similar
 language.
 Uh
 we
 see
 total


available
 market
 TAM
 being
 thrown
 around


quite
 a
 lot
 nowadays.
 How
 do
 you
 decide


this
 is
 actually
 like
 a
 good
 business


model
 versus
 this
 is
 just
 something
 that


has
 AI
 in
 the
 name
 and
 is
 getting
 some


attention?
 Yeah.
 So,
 we're
 I
 we're


investors
 in
 we're
 probably
 the
 largest


investor
 in
 the
 AI
 industry
 as
 a
 firm.
 I


think
 we're
 investors
 in


twothirds
 of
 the
 aggregate
 AI
 revenue.


So,
 if
 you
 were
 to
 just
 sum
 together
 all


of
 the
 AI
 revenue
 of
 the
 companies
 in


the
 private
 markets,
 we're
 investors
 in


about
 twothirds
 of
 it.
 So,
 I
 think
 we


have
 a
 front
 row
 seat
 to
 it.


>> You
 know,
 first
 of
 all,
 I'll
 just
 start


with
 the
 demand
 side.
 This
 is
 the


biggest
 thing
 that
 we
 look
 to.
 There's
 a


billion
 people
 plus
 using
 this


technology
 getting
 extremely
 large


surplus
 or
 value
 out
 of
 it.
 The


companies
 are
 the
 fastest
 growing
 that


we've
 ever
 seen.
 You
 know,
 active
 users


spend
 something
 like
 30
 minutes
 a
 day
 on


it.
 And
 you
 know,
 there's
 a
 tremendous


amount
 of
 surplus
 that
 comes
 with
 that


even
 if
 you're
 paying
 as
 a
 subscriber


for
 those.
 So
 on
 the
 consumer
 side,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 the
 capabilities
 are


extreme.
 They're
 very,
 very
 good.
 we're


just
 now
 starting
 to
 scratch
 the
 surface


on
 the
 capabilities
 of,
 you
 know,
 sort


of
 doing
 work
 on
 your
 behalf.
 And
 so
 I


think
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 ton
 of


progress
 on
 that
 front
 over
 the
 next


year.
 But
 the
 demand
 signals
 that
 we
 see


are
 probably
 not
 probably,
 they
 are


definitively
 the
 best
 that
 we've
 ever


seen
 in
 my
 career.
 You
 know,
 certainly


much
 faster
 than,
 you
 know,
 the
 internet


phase
 or
 mobile
 social,
 you
 know,
 cloud,


SAS,
 e-commerce,
 any
 of
 those.
 So


tremendous
 amount
 of
 value
 on
 the
 demand


side.
 That's
 the
 biggest
 thing
 we
 look


for.
 On
 the
 supply
 side,
 you
 know,
 look,


the
 buildout
 there's
 there's
 there's
 a


ton
 written
 about
 the
 buildout
 of


infrastructure
 that's
 required.
 It's,


you
 know,
 it's
 larger
 than,
 you
 know,


the
 US
 highway
 system
 overall.
 You
 know,


$5
 trillion
 over
 the
 next
 five
 to
 seven


years.
 The
 thing
 that
 I
 say
 about
 the


supply
 side
 is
 we
 don't
 need
 to
 make
 the


decision
 on
 investing
 every
 single
 one


of
 those
 dollars
 as
 an
 industry
 today.


The
 industry
 can
 monitor
 demand
 and
 we


can
 make
 decisions
 about
 capex
 as
 we
 go.


Cycle
 times
 are
 not
 five
 years
 long.


Cycle
 times
 are
 more
 like
 12
 months.
 And


so
 if
 we
 see
 a
 weakening
 of
 demand
 or
 a


lack
 of
 payback
 in
 some
 of
 this


infrastructure
 buildout,
 then
 you
 know


that's
 fine.
 we
 can
 we
 can
 adjust
 course


the
 people
 who
 are
 I
 think
 there's


probably
 a
 misconception
 about
 the


people
 who
 are
 in
 charge
 of
 these
 these


companies
 and
 you
 know
 at
 the
 center
 of


all
 this
 like
 us
 like
 we
 and
 they
 are


all
 sort
 of
 ROIC
 or
 return
 on


capital-minded
 people
 like
 we're
 not


going
 to
 you
 know
 invest
 a
 bunch
 of


capital
 if
 we
 think
 there's
 not
 going
 to


be
 a
 high
 return
 from
 it
 so
 you
 know
 to


the
 extent
 that
 there
 is
 some
 overbuild


or
 you
 know
 signs
 of
 a
 lack
 of
 demand
 to


meet
 the
 supply
 I
 think
 the
 industry


will
 adjust
 you
 know
 we've
 written
 about


this
 before.
 You
 know,
 if
 you
 contrast


this
 buildout
 with
 the
 fiber
 buildout,


so
 far,
 if
 you
 put
 a
 GPU
 or
 a
 TPU


online,
 it
 immediately
 gets
 used.
 And


and
 this
 holds
 for
 actually
 very
 old


GPUs
 and
 TPUs.
 Google's
 disclosed
 this


about
 their
 TPUs
 that
 are
 10
 years
 old.


You
 can
 pretty
 easily
 find
 pricing
 of


two
 generations
 ago
 GPUs
 on
 the
 market.


And
 the
 price
 of
 these
 have
 all
 held.


So,
 there
 are
 no
 dark
 GPUs.
 No
 one
 is


building
 data
 centers
 that
 aren't
 being


fully
 utilized
 right
 out
 of
 the
 gate.


You
 know,
 contrast
 that
 with
 the


internet
 buildout.
 The
 internet
 buildout


was
 characterized
 by
 dark
 fiber.
 And
 so,


you
 know,
 you
 had
 to
 lay
 all
 this


groundwork
 before
 you
 actually
 had
 any


signs
 of
 demand.
 And
 so,
 obviously,


there
 was
 there
 was
 a
 mismatch
 in
 supply


and
 demand.
 So,
 that's
 the
 sort
 of


overall
 kind
 of
 view
 on
 supply
 demand


dynamics.
 I'm
 very
 very
 optimistic.
 I


think
 we're
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of


figuring
 out
 really
 interesting


applications
 to
 build
 on
 top
 of
 this


technology.
 And
 you
 know
 in
 terms
 of


model
 capabilities,


models
 are
 improving
 at
 a
 like


eyepopping
 rate.
 You
 know
 they
 can


basically
 double
 their
 ability
 to


complete
 long
 form
 tasks
 over
 six
 to


seven
 months.
 And
 so
 you
 know
 if
 you


were
 to
 just
 arrest
 model
 development


today
 I
 think
 we
 would
 have
 the
 chance


to
 build
 10
 to
 20
 years
 of
 really


interesting
 applications
 on
 top
 of
 it.


The
 big
 thing
 that
 happened
 in
 public


markets
 so
 far
 this
 year
 is
 the
 absolute


slaughtering
 of
 sort
 of
 nonAI
 companies


and
 legacy
 software
 companies
 of
 various


sorts
 and
 so
 forth.
 How
 are
 you
 thinking


about
 companies
 that
 don't
 own
 a
 model


that
 maybe
 have
 to
 buy
 intelligence
 from


another
 company
 or
 so
 forth?
 Who
 in
 your


view
 when
 you're
 thinking
 about
 private


or
 public
 companies,
 who
 that's
 not
 an


AI
 lab,
 what
 types
 of
 businesses
 survive


and
 which
 ones
 are
 not
 going
 to
 survive


if
 they
 don't
 own
 intelligence
 in
 the


raw.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 I
 will
 cover
 both
 of
 these


topics
 because
 I
 have
 pretty
 strong


views
 on
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


software
 market
 and
 then
 we
 can
 talk


about
 what's
 what
 the
 sort
 of
 future
 of


companies
 that
 don't
 own
 a
 model
 is.
 On


the
 latter
 point,
 we
 we
 can
 cover
 that


one
 first.
 Look,
 companies
 buy


solutions,
 right?
 And
 so,
 you
 know,


context
 is
 still
 king.
 In
 most


industries,
 there
 will
 be
 companies
 that


compound
 their
 knowledge
 of
 industry


specific
 workflows,
 industry
 specific


data
 that
 they
 attach
 to.
 And
 so,


oftentimes
 that
 won't
 be
 what
 the
 model


companies
 choose
 to
 pursue.
 You
 know,


customers
 buy
 solutions,
 they
 they
 don't


buy
 some
 discrete
 workflow
 or
 just
 a


database
 or
 a
 system
 to
 take
 action.
 So,


the
 most
 important
 thing
 is
 industry


context.
 You
 also
 need
 a
 throat
 to


choke,
 right?
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be


increasingly
 important
 for
 customers,


you
 know?
 So
 support,
 maintenance,


integrations,
 data
 partnerships,
 user


community,
 I
 think
 are
 all
 important


things
 for
 companies
 that
 are
 building


applications
 that
 are
 not
 model
 owners.


And
 I
 think
 in
 most
 verticals
 and
 many


of
 the
 functions
 in
 an
 organization,


there
 will
 be
 independent
 companies
 that


do
 that.
 Model
 companies
 are
 going to
 be


an
 arms
 dealer
 to
 most
 industries
 for


some
 tasks
 or
 work
 that
 are
 highly


horizontal
 or
 general.
 So
 something
 like


general
 knowledge
 management


>> inside
 of
 a
 corporation,
 the
 model


companies
 are
 probably
 pretty
 well


positioned
 for
 that.
 But
 you
 know
 things


like
 legal
 work,
 medical
 work,
 customer


support
 tasks,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


that
 will
 happen
 in
 in
 sales,


accounting,
 finance,
 like
 those
 I
 think


those
 are
 going to
 be
 independent


vendors
 and
 the
 model
 companies
 are


going
 to
 be
 arms
 dealers
 to
 those.
 So


that
 I
 think
 is
 the
 future
 of


applications
 for
 companies
 that
 do
 not


own
 models.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 bright


future.
 We
 we've
 invested
 a
 lot
 in
 some


of
 these
 leading
 companies,
 but
 I
 think


both
 the
 model
 companies
 and
 those


companies
 will
 be
 big
 and
 successful
 on


the
 software
 side.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 look,


the
 the
 the
 software
 industry
 has
 been


crushed
 in
 the
 public
 markets.
 We
 could


debate
 whether
 it's
 overblown
 or
 not,


but


>> I'll
 give
 you
 my
 diagnosis
 of
 the


situation,
 you
 know,
 not
 not


particularly
 on
 valuations
 of
 specific


companies,
 but
 here's
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 with
 the
 software
 companies
 in


the
 public
 markets.
 I
 think
 the
 issue
 is


not
 that
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 ton
 of


new
 software
 in
 the
 future.
 There
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 ton
 of
 new
 software
 in
 the


future.
 The
 whole
 story
 of
 SAS
 and
 cloud


was
 that
 the
 market
 grew
 7x
 in
 size
 and


some
 of
 that
 was
 captured
 by
 incumbents.


Some
 of
 it
 was
 captured
 by
 startups.
 The


issue
 is
 are
 the
 incumbents
 that
 are
 in


the
 public
 markets
 going
 to
 actually
 be


the
 ones
 that
 capture
 that?
 And
 by
 the


way,
 I
 think
 it'll
 be
 much
 bigger
 than


7x
 this
 time.
 So
 why
 is
 it,
 you
 know,


sort
 of
 a
 question
 of
 whether
 those


incumbents
 have
 the
 chance
 to
 do
 it?


First
 of
 all,
 it's
 probably
 going
 to
 be


much
 harder
 for
 them
 to
 grow,
 right?
 All


the
 new
 budget
 basically
 in
 any
 buyer


organization
 is
 going
 toward
 AI


initiatives
 right
 now.
 Now,
 it
 doesn't


mean
 that
 they're
 ripping
 out
 their


software
 systems.
 Gross
 dollar
 retention


remains
 extremely
 high
 for
 these


incumbent
 software
 systems,
 and
 I
 think


it
 will
 for
 a
 while.
 But
 if
 you
 look


since
 2021,


net
 dollar
 retention
 of
 these
 companies


has
 steadily
 declined.


>> If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 amount
 of
 revenue


that
 the
 entire
 software
 industry
 is


adding
 in
 2026,
 the
 amount
 of
 revenue


that
 OpenAI
 and
 Enthropic
 alone
 will
 add


is
 going
 to
 be
 greater
 than
 the
 amount


of
 the
 total
 revenue
 added
 by
 all
 of
 the


software
 market.
 like
 that's
 SAP
 into


it,
 Salesforce,
 Workday,
 Service
 Now,


all
 those
 vendors.
 So
 the
 growth
 is


actually
 going
 toward
 AI
 initiatives.


And
 so
 you
 know,
 yes,
 they
 may
 not
 be


getting
 ripped
 out,
 those
 incumbent


vendors,
 but
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 much


harder
 for
 them
 to
 find
 growth.
 So,
 you


know,
 from
 a
 product
 standpoint,
 they're


not
 going
 to
 get
 torn
 out,
 but
 they


really
 run
 the
 risk
 of
 value
 getting


built
 on
 top
 of
 them.
 So
 those
 are
 going


to
 be
 systems
 of
 record,
 but
 you
 just


build
 new
 vendors,
 build
 new
 products


that
 can
 take
 action
 on
 top
 of
 those.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 real
 risk
 for
 the


software
 industry
 right
 now.
 If
 building


software,
 the
 process
 of
 building


software
 becomes
 much
 faster.
 There's
 a


another
 dynamic
 where
 every
 vendor
 can


basically
 increase
 the
 amount
 of
 SKUs


they
 offer
 rapidly,
 massively.
 And
 so
 if


you
 are
 a
 platform
 vendor
 of
 choice
 and


you
 sell
 a
 bunch
 of
 software
 in
 this


domain,
 chances
 are
 everyone
 in
 the
 in


the
 nearby
 domains
 will
 also
 have
 those


products
 and
 they'll
 all
 try
 to
 sell


those
 new
 products
 and
 it'll
 get
 more


competitive.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 dynamic


that's
 that's
 really
 a
 risk
 for
 them.


The
 most
 powerful
 change
 that
 I
 think
 is


going
 to
 happen
 which
 we're
 only
 seeing


early
 signals
 of
 is
 a
 business
 model


shift.
 So
 when
 these
 technology
 shifts


happen,
 you
 know,
 a
 new
 user
 interface,


new
 workflows,
 new
 data
 that
 you
 access,


that
 favors,
 you
 know,
 newcomers,
 you


know,
 over
 incumbents,
 when
 you
 pair
 it


with
 a
 business
 model
 shift,
 that


massively
 favors
 the
 newcomers,
 right?


Because
 it's
 so
 hard
 to
 react
 if
 you're


one
 of
 the
 incumbents.
 And
 so
 the
 big


shift
 if
 you
 if
 you
 just
 take
 a
 spectrum


of
 business
 models
 that's
 happened
 you


know
 we
 used
 to
 sell
 license
 maintenance


software
 we
 moved
 that
 to
 you
 know


seatbased
 subscription
 then
 with
 the


clouds
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 have
 become


consumptionbased
 pricing
 models
 and
 in


the
 future
 with
 AI
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 domains


it's
 going
 to
 be
 outcome
 based
 pricing


you
 can
 see
 this
 first
 in
 the
 customer


support
 industry
 because
 there's
 sort
 of


verifiable
 tasks
 that
 those
 companies


have
 to
 complete
 but
 to
 the
 extent
 that


we
 actually
 get
 to
 the
 point
 where
 the


predominant
 way
 that
 that
 enterprises


want
 to
 buy
 is
 via
 outcomes
 and
 they
 can


measure
 those
 results.
 I
 think
 it's


going
 to
 be
 really
 tough
 for
 the


incumbent.


>> David
 George
 and
 Horwitz,
 thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 uh
 coming
 on
 Oddlos.
 That
 was


fascinating.
 Learned
 a
 ton
 and
 really


appreciate
 you
 taking
 your
 time.


>> Thanks
 so
 much,
 [music]
 David.


>> Great
 to
 be
 with
 you
 all.
 Thanks
 for


having
 me.


>> [music]


>> Tracy,
 I
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 fascinating


conversation.
 So
 much
 there.
 And
 you


know,
 it's
 fun
 to
 talk
 tech,
 but
 also


have
 it
 be
 such
 a
 capital
 marketsheavy


conversation.


>> Yeah,
 I
 kind
 of
 the
 idea
 of
 software


companies,
 their
 value
 resting
 in
 the


fact
 that
 they're
 like
 convenient


scapegoats
 for
 management.
 Yeah,
 it's


kind
 of
 funny
 in
 a
 dystopian
 way,
 but


>> I
 remember
 Steve
 Balmer
 said
 that
 years


ago
 when
 he
 was
 talking
 about
 why
 Linux


wouldn't
 take
 off
 cuz
 he's
 like,
 "No,


what
 are
 you
 going
 to
 just
 like
 who
 are


you
 going
 to
 get
 upset
 when
 your
 Linux


goes
 down?"
 Although
 then
 companies
 did,


you
 know,
 Redhead
 grew
 up
 to
 like


professionally
 service.
 I
 thought
 that


was
 very
 interesting
 the
 idea
 of
 like


outcomebased
 pricing
 but
 just
 also
 some


of
 the
 numbers
 are
 staggering
 just
 like


how
 big
 you
 know
 this
 is
 I've
 thought


about
 this
 with
 like
 um
 when
 people
 look


at
 the
 public
 markets


>> and
 they
 say
 well
 yeah
 it's
 not
 that


overvalued
 because
 you
 know
 most
 of
 the


public
 companies
 are
 making
 a
 lot
 of


money
 if
 you
 were
 to
 sort
 of
 like
 build


one
 index
 of
 big
 private
 and
 public


companies
 you
 would
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 market


cap
 on
 companies
 that
 aren't
 making


money
 yet
 and
 that
 would
 very
 much
 like


sort


skew
 your
 view
 of
 the
 sort
 of
 like
 total


valuation
 of
 the
 universe
 of
 tech


companies.


>> Absolutely.
 Well,
 the
 other
 thing
 I
 was


thinking
 is
 just
 that
 question
 of


whether
 or
 not
 that
 kind
 of
 the
 balance


between
 private
 and
 public
 starts
 to


reverse
 because
 so
 much
 of
 the


excitement
 right
 now
 is
 about
 AI
 which


you
 know
 is
 spending
 billions
 and


billions
 and
 needs
 huge
 pools
 of


capital.
 I
 guess
 the
 counterpoint
 to


that
 is
 like
 there's
 a
 self-reinforcing


trend
 in
 the
 private
 market
 which
 is


like
 if
 that's
 where
 all
 the
 growth
 is,


if
 that's
 where
 people
 are
 making
 all


the
 money,
 it
 tends
 to
 attract
 even
 more


capital.
 So
 I
 don't
 know,
 maybe
 maybe
 AI


means
 that
 private
 capital
 grows
 even


more
 and
 so
 AI
 can
 keep
 tapping
 it.


>> There
 seems
 to
 just
 be
 an
 endless
 amount


of
 money
 in
 the
 Middle
 East


specifically.
 you
 know,
 it's
 like
 raging


more
 from
 the
 UAE
 or
 Saudi
 or
 whatever


that
 just
 keeps
 these
 uh
 companies


private.
 If
 I
 were
 at
 like
 um
 open,
 I


would
 be
 really
 anxious
 about
 selling
 in


a
 tender.
 I
 would
 be
 like
 I
 don't
 want


to
 I
 I
 believe
 I
 believe
 I
 swear
 I


believe
 in
 I
 believe
 we're
 going
 to
 get


there
 to
 ASI
 or
 whatever.
 I
 would
 be


really
 uncomfortable
 about
 it
 tapping


out
 and
 hedging
 my
 portfolio.


>> Joe,
 you'd
 have
 to
 be
 very
 very


important
 for
 the
 founder
 to
 actually


care
 about
 what
 you're
 doing
 with
 your


shares,
 but
 I'm
 sure
 you
 would
 be.

 right.
