Hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 this


conversation
 with
 Richia
 Shama.
 We
 are


here
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 it's
 a
 fake


background
 but
 it's
 actually
 a
 real


background.
 [laughter]


>> I
 this
 is
 what
 they
 use
 often
 with
 the


green
 screen.


>> Yeah
 know
 it's
 absolutely
 beautiful.


>> Right.


>> Um
 now
 you
 are
 one
 of
 the
 really
 deep


and
 great
 thinkers
 and
 uh
 we
 met
 last


year
 and
 talked
 about
 your
 book
 what


went
 wrong
 with
 capitalism.


>> Right


>> now
 uh
 there's
 been
 another
 year
 and
 my


has
 the
 world
 changed.
 So
 what
 is
 your


what
 is
 your
 take
 uh
 when
 it
 comes
 to


what
 has
 happened
 with
 capitalism
 over


the
 last
 12
 months?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 um
 a
 bit


dispiriting
 right
 because
 of
 the
 fact


that
 everywhere
 I
 think
 what
 we
 see
 is


that
 the
 role
 of
 the
 government
 keeps


expanding.
 We
 have
 a
 new
 government
 as


well
 here
 in
 in
 the
 US
 but
 I
 still
 feel


the
 fact
 that
 uh
 the
 faith
 the
 old
 faith


that
 you
 need
 to
 sort
 of
 have
 the


government
 do
 the
 minimum
 stuff
 and
 get


out
 of
 the
 way
 after
 that.
 I
 think


that's
 been
 fundamentally
 shaken


everywhere.
 Um,
 now
 of
 course
 the


current
 government
 is
 doing
 a
 lot
 of


stuff
 on
 deregulation
 which
 is
 something


which
 I
 think
 is
 a
 very
 big
 positive
 but


still
 I
 think
 this
 sort
 of
 uh
 thought


process
 exists
 that
 you
 got
 to
 be
 there


to
 bail
 out
 you
 know
 when
 someone
 gets


into
 trouble
 and
 the
 Federal
 Reserve


also
 that
 you
 know
 like
 at
 the
 slightest


hint
 of
 trouble
 they
 want
 to
 cut


interest
 rates.
 I
 think
 like
 to
 me
 that


asymmetry
 which
 is
 what
 I
 lamented
 a
 lot


in
 the
 book
 that
 on
 the
 upside
 you
 have


capitalism
 that
 you
 can
 capitalize
 with


the
 gains
 on
 the
 downside
 the
 risks
 are


socialized
 I
 think
 that
 asymmetry
 still


remains
 in
 the
 system
 and
 that's
 what


continues
 to
 concern
 me


>> uh
 but
 just
 before
 we
 we
 go
 there
 what


are
 the
 other
 things
 you
 think
 we
 should


unpack
 with
 the
 events
 of
 the
 last
 12


months


>> well
 I
 think
 that
 the
 uh
 you
 know
 like


everybody
 was
 obsessed
 with
 Trump


>> but
 here's
 I
 think
 what's
 happened
 in


the
 last
 12
 months
 months
 that
 uh
 one


big
 factor
 has
 out
 trumped
 Trump
 that's


AI
 which
 is
 that
 uh
 that's
 now
 I
 think


become
 the
 singular
 focus
 of
 the
 global


economy
 and
 particularly
 the
 US
 economy


the
 US
 economy
 has
 now
 become
 one
 big


bet
 on
 AI
 because
 outside
 of
 AI
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 weakness
 in
 the
 US
 economy
 but


AI
 has
 continued
 to
 drive
 everything
 so


this
 big
 bet
 on
 AI
 better
 work
 out
 for


America
 because
 if
 it
 doesn't
 work
 out


then
 I
 think
 think
 that
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


trouble
 for
 this
 uh
 country
 ahead
 but


for
 now
 it's
 all
 about
 AI.
 I
 think


that's
 really
 emerged
 as
 the
 big
 factor.


>> When
 you
 look
 at
 the
 importance
 of
 AI
 in


this
 society
 and
 in
 the
 stock
 market


just
 what
 are
 the
 kind
 of
 things
 that


you
 look
 at?


>> Well,
 there
 are
 a
 couple
 of
 things
 right


which
 is
 that
 I
 think
 that
 one
 is
 that


how
 big
 an
 impact
 is
 AI
 already
 having


on
 economic
 growth.


>> So
 uh
 the
 measures
 you
 know
 currently


show
 that
 about
 40%
 of
 economic
 growth


in
 America
 this
 year
 has
 come
 from
 capex


spending
 towards
 AI.
 M


>> so
 that's
 one
 way.
 The
 second
 effect
 I


think
 is
 also
 something
 which
 is


important
 but
 underappreciated
 which
 is


the
 wealth
 effect
 which
 is
 that
 the


stock
 market
 doing
 well
 the
 financial


assets
 doing
 well
 that
 is
 clearly


powering
 the
 spending
 of
 the
 top
 10%
 in


this
 country
 and
 the
 top
 10%
 is
 what's


driving
 the
 entire
 consumer
 spending
 in


a
 way
 in
 the
 like
 in
 this
 country.
 So


the
 stock
 market
 about
 80%
 of
 the
 gains


in
 the
 stock
 market
 this
 year
 have
 been


powered
 by
 AI
 plays
 and
 that
 in
 turn
 I


think
 is
 powering
 the
 spending
 of
 the


really
 rich
 people.
 So
 by
 some
 measures


you
 can
 argue
 that
 about
 60%
 of
 economic


growth
 in
 America
 today
 is
 being
 driven


by
 AI.
 Now
 the
 problem
 with
 that
 is
 the


fact
 that
 uh
 there
 are
 also
 the
 classic


signs
 of
 a
 bubble.
 I
 mean
 as
 financial


historians
 we


>> but
 let's
 not
 do
 the
 bubble
 yet.
 So
 60%


of
 the
 growth
 in
 the
 US
 is
 coming
 from


AI.
 Yes.
 But
 from
 um
 what
 we
 think
 will


come
 as
 reflected
 in
 share
 prices
 of


these
 companies,
 right?


>> Yes.


>> Now
 what
 are
 you
 [clears throat]
 seeing


in
 terms
 of
 real
 economic
 benefit
 of
 the


implementation
 of
 AI?


>> Well,
 so
 far
 it's
 too
 early
 because
 you


know
 because
 the
 AI
 adoption
 is
 still
 in


its
 nent
 stage.
 So
 we
 have
 seen
 some


increase
 in
 productivity
 in
 the
 American


economy
 in
 the
 last
 2
 or
 3
 years.


>> How
 much
 do
 you
 think


>> is
 coming
 from
 this


>> uh
 from
 AI
 as
 yet?
 I
 think
 it's
 too


early.
 So
 I
 think
 very
 little
 is
 yet


>> when
 you
 when
 you
 think
 we'll
 see
 it
 in


>> Well,
 it
 should
 happen
 in
 the
 next
 two


or
 three
 years,
 right?
 Because
 even
 if


you
 look
 back
 at
 the
 internet
 revolution


which
 took
 place
 back
 in
 the
 late
 1990s,


the
 big
 bump
 in
 productivity
 really


happened
 towards
 the
 late
 1990s
 and
 then


continued
 after
 the
 recession
 of
 2000


into
 the
 early
 2000s.
 So
 it
 takes
 a


while
 for
 this
 for
 these
 benefits
 to


come
 through.
 Now
 we
 don't
 even
 know
 as


yet
 Nicol
 that
 what
 exactly
 is
 AI
 going


to
 end
 up
 doing.
 So
 far
 the
 promise
 is


huge.
 All
 of
 us
 have
 started
 to
 use
 AI


in
 some
 form
 or
 the
 other
 but
 uh
 we're


not
 quite
 sure
 whether
 the
 productivity


increases
 are
 coming.
 And
 there's
 one


very
 important
 distinction
 with
 this
 AI


adoption
 compared
 to
 the
 past
 uh
 big


tech
 revolutions
 which
 are
 happened
 if
 I


can
 say
 so
 that
 this
 is
 the
 most
 hated


tech
 revolution.
 And
 what
 do
 I
 mean
 by


that?
 that
 if
 you
 look
 back
 at
 the
 uh


other
 big
 revolution
 which
 have
 happened


even
 the
 bubbles
 which
 have
 taken
 place


going
 back
 again
 to
 the
 famous
 parallel


which
 is
 the
 late
 1990s
 that
 um
 all
 the


surveys
 show
 that
 back
 in
 the
 mid
 '90s


and
 late
 '90s
 people
 were
 very


optimistic
 about
 what
 the
 internet
 could


do
 for
 them
 there
 was
 huge
 optimism


about
 it
 today
 the
 surveys
 are
 showing


that
 most
 people
 are
 quite
 pessimistic


about
 what
 AI
 can
 do
 and
 that's
 because


of
 two
 reasons.
 One,
 all
 the
 techno


optimists
 are
 telling
 them
 that
 we're


coming
 for
 your
 job,
 which
 is
 that
 the


big
 benefit
 of
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 be
 that


we're
 going
 to
 take
 out
 labor
 costs.
 And


second
 is
 just
 the
 fear,
 which
 is
 that


what
 are
 we
 going
 to
 do
 with
 this
 AI?


How
 do
 we
 use
 these
 AI
 tools?
 Everyone's


telling
 us
 that
 AI
 is
 here
 and
 if
 you


don't
 use
 AI,
 your
 job
 can
 be
 gone.
 And


people
 are
 fearful
 of
 it.
 So
 in
 fact


some
 of
 the
 surveys
 that
 I've
 seen
 show


that
 only
 about
 35%
 of
 the
 people
 are
 uh


feeling
 good
 about
 AI
 and
 most
 of
 it
 in


fact
 want
 this
 to
 be
 regulated
 in
 some


way
 because
 they're
 fearful
 about
 the


impact
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 have.
 So
 if
 I


look
 at
 the
 past
 manas,
 bubbles
 or
 even


if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 past
 uh
 big


revolutions,
 people
 are
 typically
 are


very
 optimistic
 about
 what
 it's
 going
 to


bring,
 right?
 Electricity,
 cars
 or
 even


in
 places
 like
 Japan
 when
 you
 like
 in


the
 late
 80s
 so
 much
 confidence.
 China,


you
 know,
 like
 a
 decade
 ago
 and
 stuff.


But
 with
 AI,
 the
 big
 difference
 I
 feel


is
 people
 are
 like
 really
 scared
 that


what
 is
 this
 going
 to
 do
 for
 me?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 it
 may
 be
 that
 many
 people


are
 scared.
 I
 totally
 love
 it.


>> Right.


>> Yeah.
 And
 we
 are
 embracing
 it
 big
 time


in
 in
 uh
 you
 know
 in
 our
 company.


>> Yes.
 But
 are
 you
 but
 is
 it
 sort
 of


costing
 jobs
 as
 well?
 I
 think
 that
 is


the
 big
 thing.


>> We
 we
 make
 sure
 it
 won't
 cost
 any
 jobs.


Uh
 but
 it
 does
 increase
 the
 amount
 of


work
 we
 can
 do
 and
 the
 complexity
 of


what
 we
 do
 and
 the
 quality
 of
 what
 we
 do


in
 a
 very
 very
 big
 way
 and
 we
 can
 do
 all


that
 with
 the
 same
 number
 of
 people.
 But


I
 I
 can
 see
 where
 you
 come
 from.
 Now


bubble
 is
 it
 a
 bubble?
 Well,
 I
 think


that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 uh
 uh
 you
 know


the
 four
 sort
 of
 O's
 is
 how
 I
 call
 it
 of


uh
 guiding
 you
 whether
 we
 have
 a
 bubble


or
 not
 like
 what
 are
 these
 four
 O's
 for


me
 um
 one
 O
 is
 overinvestment
 now
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 amount
 of
 investment
 going


into
 AI
 today
 as
 a
 share
 of
 GDP
 the
 tech


investment
 it
 is
 comparable
 to
 what
 we


saw
 in
 past
 bubbles
 including
 in
 2000


which
 is
 that
 the
 tech
 investment
 as
 a


share
 of
 GDP
 is
 about
 5%
 or
 so
 today


That's
 roughly
 what
 we
 saw
 back
 in
 2000.


Some
 in
 some
 ways
 we
 are
 seeing


overinvestment.
 The
 other
 sign
 of
 a


bubble
 typically
 tends
 to
 be
 that
 you


get
 overvaluation.


Now
 by
 any
 stretch
 the
 US
 stock
 market


in
 particular
 and
 of
 course
 the
 AI
 plays


are
 overvalued.
 Some
 argue
 that
 the


valuation
 is
 not
 yet
 as
 expensive
 as
 it


was
 in
 2000
 or
 so.
 Yeah,
 by
 some


measures
 it's
 not
 such
 as
 the
 PE
 ratios


and
 stuff,
 but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 things


like
 price
 to
 free
 cash
 flow
 or
 you
 look


at
 very
 long-term
 earnings,
 by
 those


measures
 we
 are
 getting
 there.
 So
 that


also
 checks
 out.
 The
 third
 tends
 to
 be


one
 of
 uh
 over
 ownership
 that
 everyone


just
 sort
 of
 uh
 crowds
 into
 the
 same


trades
 and
 stuff.
 And
 one
 sort
 of
 simple


measure
 of
 looking
 at
 this
 in
 America
 is


that
 today
 uh
 about
 uh
 if
 you
 look
 at


the
 financial
 wealth
 here
 uh
 Americans


have
 about
 52%
 of
 their
 financial
 wealth


today
 in
 equities
 that
 is
 higher
 than


what
 it
 was
 even
 in
 2000.
 So
 and
 people


are
 like
 trading
 this
 like
 uh
 crazy
 out


there.
 The
 fourth
 often
 has
 to
 do
 with


over
 leverage
 that
 you
 end
 up
 getting


too
 much
 leverage
 in
 the
 system.
 on


there
 the
 evidence
 is
 a
 bit
 more
 mixed


because
 these
 companies
 which
 have
 been


building
 out
 the
 AI
 have
 broadly
 been


flush
 with
 cash
 you
 know
 they've


generated
 very
 high
 free
 cash
 flow
 but


that's
 changing
 very
 quickly
 that
 in
 the


last
 few
 months
 if
 you
 look
 at
 it
 the


biggest
 issuers
 of
 debt
 have
 been


companies
 like
 Meta
 and
 Amazon
 and
 even


Microsoft
 so
 they're
 beginning
 to
 really


issue
 debt
 very
 rapidly
 because
 it's


arms
 race
 for
 AI
 has
 really
 taken
 off


everyone
 wants
 to
 be
 ahead
 and
 they're


all
 thinking
 that
 the
 big
 risk
 will
 be


that
 what
 if
 we
 don't
 end
 up
 uh
 ahead
 on


AI.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 so
 by
 the
 most


checkpoints


>> so
 so
 the
 thing
 so
 tell
 me
 through
 just


talk
 me
 through
 how
 you
 think
 that
 they


are
 thinking
 now
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 fear
 of


being
 left
 behind.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 what's
 happening
 is
 I


think
 that
 like
 this
 was
 a
 statement


made
 last
 year
 by
 Sundar
 Pachai
 where
 he


said
 that
 the
 big
 risk
 for
 us
 is
 not


that
 we
 uh
 invest
 uh
 too
 much
 but
 we


invest
 too
 little.
 So
 I
 think
 that's


become
 the
 mindset
 just
 now
 in
 terms
 of


investing
 too
 little
 in
 like
 uh
 AI.
 So


um
 and
 and
 there's
 a
 big
 distinction


which
 I
 saw
 which
 is
 quite
 fascinating


that
 in
 the
 1990s
 there
 was
 a
 gradual


buildup
 in
 the
 tech
 investment
 cycle


right
 that
 it
 it
 started
 building
 in
 in


the
 early
 to
 mid
 '90s
 and
 then
 it
 kept


ramping
 up.
 This
 time
 what
 we
 have
 seen


is
 that
 this
 has
 been
 the
 fastest


buildup
 we
 have
 seen
 in
 the
 investment


cycle
 that
 we've
 gone
 from
 uh
 AI
 and


tech
 capex
 virtually
 contributing


nothing
 to
 GDP
 growth
 2
 years
 ago
 to
 now


contributing
 as
 I
 said
 40%
 or
 so.
 So


this
 is
 a
 huge
 buildup
 which
 is


happening
 and
 it's
 happening
 very


rapidly.
 Now,
 of
 course,
 some
 people


argue
 that
 the
 flip
 side
 is
 that
 even


the
 adoption
 this
 time
 is
 very
 quick
 of


like
 AI
 compared
 to
 the
 past.
 But
 the


buildup
 in
 investment
 and
 how
 much
 now


is
 being
 financed
 by
 debt
 that's


changing
 very
 quickly
 even
 as
 we
 speak.


>> But
 does
 it
 matter
 whether
 it's
 um
 I


mean
 some
 people
 differentiate
 now


between
 a
 good
 bubble
 and
 a
 bad
 bubble.


It's
 a
 good
 bubble
 because
 it
 uh


reallocates
 capital
 to
 something
 which


is
 going
 to
 drive
 productivity
 in


society.


>> Yes.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 it's
 correct
 that


most
 technology
 bubbles
 tend
 to
 be
 good


bubbles
 because
 in
 the
 wake
 what's
 left


behind
 tends
 to
 be
 something
 which


everybody
 can
 benefit


>> and
 the
 bad
 bubbles
 tend
 to
 be
 things


like
 real
 estate
 bubbles.


>> So
 is
 this
 a
 good
 or
 a
 bad
 one?


>> Well
 this
 is
 a
 good
 bubble
 in
 that


regard
 which
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 has


the
 promise
 as
 you
 have
 said
 of


improving
 productivity
 improving


technology
 uh
 considerably.


>> So
 I
 think
 that
 way
 this
 is
 a
 good


bubble.
 M
 I
 just
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to


what's
 one
 of
 the
 things
 you
 said
 in
 the


beginning
 the
 fact
 that
 uh
 the


governments
 are
 building
 up
 you
 know
 u


the
 bureaucracy
 and
 the
 state
 uh
 and
 so


on
 is
 that
 really
 true
 I
 mean
 are
 we


seeing
 and
 if
 we
 look
 at
 it
 if
 we
 start


with
 America
 with
 the
 US
 is
 the
 US
 uh


kind
 of
 bureaucracy
 continuing
 to
 build


you
 feel


>> well
 I
 think
 that
 there
 is
 uh
 some


slowdown
 in
 like
 in
 terms
 of
 the


deregulation
 and
 stuff
 but
 what's


changed
 now
 is
 that
 this
 whole
 idea
 a
 of


the
 American
 government
 directly
 taking


stakes
 in
 in
 companies
 that's
 like
 a


further
 evolution
 in
 the
 state's


involvement
 in
 the
 economy.
 I
 mean
 the


my
 sort
 of
 point
 has
 been
 that
 the
 uh


state's
 increased
 involvement
 in
 the


economy
 is
 something
 which
 has
 caused


productivity
 growth
 undermined
 the


dynamism
 and
 also
 led
 to
 increased


inequality
 by
 favoring
 the
 entrenched


and
 the
 establishment
 and
 I
 think
 that


there's
 no
 sign
 that
 that
 process
 is


broadly
 reversing
 itself.
 So
 yes,
 there


are
 some
 good
 signs
 like
 deregulation


and
 stuff
 which
 is
 happening
 but
 on
 the


other
 hand
 I
 think
 that
 this
 you
 know


the
 idea
 that
 the
 American
 government


today
 like
 all
 the
 tech
 moguls
 and


everybody
 everybody
 wants
 to
 be on
 the


right
 side
 of
 the
 government
 because


they
 don't
 know
 as
 to
 what
 can
 happen
 at


any
 point
 in
 time
 as
 far
 as
 they
 are


concerned.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 that
 is


something
 which
 is
 clearly
 sort
 of
 you


know
 like
 you
 can
 see
 the
 increased
 role


of
 government.
 Now
 I
 come
 originally


from
 India
 and
 you
 know
 like
 one
 thing


which
 I
 used
 to
 always
 sort
 of
 fascinate


me
 was
 that
 uh
 the
 difference
 between


India
 and
 America
 one
 thing
 used
 to
 be


that
 in
 India
 for
 example
 no
 business


person
 at
 least
 of
 any
 consequence
 will


say
 something
 negative
 about
 the


government
 because
 they
 are
 fearful
 that


even
 though
 it's
 a
 democracy
 they'd
 be


fearful
 that
 if
 you
 say
 something


against
 the
 government
 the
 government


can
 unleash
 the
 regulatory
 might
 of
 the


state
 against
 you.
 Yeah,
 I
 noticed
 that


when
 I
 was
 in
 India,
 nobody
 I
 met
 like


40
 business
 leaders,
 nobody
 said
 a


native
 word
 about
 the
 you
 know
 about
 the


government


>> especially
 in
 public.


>> Yeah,
 even
 private
 even
 private.
 So
 I


think
 that
 that's
 there.
 Now
 in
 America


we
 always
 pride
 ourselves
 that
 listen
 in


America
 you
 can
 say
 what
 you
 want.


People
 would
 openly
 be
 Democrats,


Republicans
 and
 stuff.
 Today
 if
 you


notice
 and
 you
 see
 some
 of
 these
 uh
 you


know
 meetings
 which
 happened
 with
 the


American
 government
 where
 people
 are


sitting
 around
 the
 table
 they've
 all


become
 you
 know
 these
 oneupman
 shows


where
 everyone
 is
 now
 telling
 the
 other


person
 about
 how
 much
 they
 love
 the


Trump
 and
 how
 much
 they
 love
 government.


That's
 a
 big
 change
 I've
 seen
 in
 America


and
 it's
 almost
 converged
 with
 what
 I


used
 to
 see
 in
 India.


>> Well
 how
 do
 you
 read
 this?


>> What
 are
 the
 implications?
 Well,


implications
 are
 that
 the
 fear
 of
 the


government


>> which
 is
 that
 the
 fear
 of
 the
 government


is
 such
 that
 that
 if
 you
 say
 something


too
 negative
 against
 the
 government
 they


could
 come
 after
 you
 that
 you
 know


something
 could
 be
 done.
 I
 think
 that
 uh


tells
 you
 about
 it
 right
 that
 how
 that


change
 has
 taken
 place
 here


>> the
 deeper
 involvement
 of
 uh
 the


government
 do
 you
 read
 the
 tariffs
 in


the
 same
 way
 is
 that
 also
 a
 function
 of


that


>> yeah
 it's
 also
 because
 the
 tariff
 policy


is
 you
 know
 so
 subjective
 right
 there's


no
 the
 there's
 no
 objectivity
 and


science
 behind
 it
 it's
 like
 you
 can
 sort


of
 decide
 in
 terms
 of
 who
 you
 want
 to


tariff
 which
 country
 you
 want
 to
 tariff


which
 industry
 you
 want
 to
 tariff
 and
 if


you
 think
 someone's
 doing
 a
 decent
 job


you
 can
 cut
 their
 tariff
 rate
 down
 if


you
 need
 their
 help
 so
 this
 is
 obviously


like
 something
 which
 is
 very
 arbitrary


even
 if
 you
 like
 tariffs
 as
 a
 policy
 as


a
 revenue
 earner
 but
 the
 way
 the


implementation
 is
 done
 is
 very
 arbitrary


so
 these
 are
 all
 signs
 of
 increased
 stat


state statism
 and
 increased


interventionism
 so
 uh
 I
 hate
 to
 say
 it


in
 the
 last
 year
 or
 so
 I
 don't
 think


we've
 seen
 any
 big
 shift
 take
 place
 in


the
 increased
 role
 of
 government
 uh
 in


our
 lives


>> so
 the
 other
 factors
 that
 you
 mentioned


in
 your
 book
 um
 why
 capitalism
 you
 know


doesn't
 work.
 What
 are
 the
 other
 factors


that
 you
 track?


>> Well,
 as
 I
 said
 that
 for
 me
 capitalism


is
 still
 something
 which
 works.
 It
 just


is
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 as
 the
 book
 said


that
 what
 went
 wrong
 with
 capitalism
 and


my
 answer
 that
 capitalism
 did
 not
 fail.


The
 government
 ruined
 it.
 But
 the
 good


news
 is
 that
 there
 are
 other
 parts
 of


the
 world
 which
 I
 also
 covered
 in
 the


book
 where
 capitalism
 is
 sort
 of
 you


know
 still
 working
 and
 like
 what
 I
 mean


by
 working
 is
 that
 it's
 moving
 in
 the


right
 direction.
 Even
 America
 is
 still


broadly
 a
 capitalist
 society
 just
 not


the
 way
 it
 used
 to
 be.
 We've
 seen
 a


degradation
 of
 that
 over
 time.
 But
 if
 I


go
 to
 countries
 like
 a
 Vietnam
 or
 even
 a


uh
 Taiwan
 etc.
 I
 see
 places
 where
 people


are
 still
 moving
 in
 the
 right
 direction


of
 giving
 people
 economic
 freedom.
 What


is
 capitalism
 for
 me?
 Capitalism
 is


about
 giving
 people
 more
 economic


freedom
 about
 promoting
 more
 competition


about
 there
 being
 churn
 about
 you
 know


so
 I
 think
 that
 those
 [clears throat]


are
 uh
 characteristics
 I
 see
 and
 what
 I


don't
 like
 is
 when
 I
 see
 outcomes
 where


in
 fact
 capitalism
 is
 not
 supposed
 to
 be


uh
 pro-incumbent
 it's
 supposed
 to
 sort


of
 you
 know
 cause
 churn
 but
 this


increased
 concentration
 where
 the
 same


companies
 dominate
 those
 to
 me
 are


perversions
 of
 capitalism
 not
 healthy


signs
 of
 capitalism


>> on
 the
 way
 from
 uh
 the
 US
 to
 China.


Let's
 uh
 touch
 down
 in
 Europe
 for
 a


second.
 So
 how
 does
 Europe
 fit
 into
 your


thinking
 here?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that
 as
 we
 discussed
 last


year
 that
 in
 many
 ways
 capitalism
 is
 in


worse
 shape
 in
 Europe,
 right?
 Because


when
 you
 get
 countries
 like
 France
 where


government
 spending
 as
 a
 share
 of
 GDP
 is


kissing
 60%.
 How
 do
 you
 call
 those


capitalist
 countries
 by
 any
 uh


definition
 and
 stuff?
 And
 that's
 been


moving.
 The
 only
 good
 thing
 about
 Europe


is
 this
 which
 is
 like
 what
 we've
 seen
 is


that
 typically
 uh
 what
 we've
 seen
 around


the
 world
 is
 that
 the
 only
 time


governments
 carry
 out
 major
 economic


reform
 is
 when
 they
 have
 their
 back
 to


the
 wall.
 So
 we
 saw
 some
 signs
 of
 that


in
 Europe
 at least
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


the
 year.
 We
 saw
 in
 Germany
 where
 you


know
 like
 I
 know
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 was
 about


fiscal
 spending
 but
 still
 about
 doing


some
 labor
 market
 reform
 and
 doing
 other


things.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 there
 are
 some


signs
 that
 when
 you
 have
 your
 back
 to


the
 wall
 you
 end
 up
 sort
 of
 carrying
 out


reforms
 and
 in
 that
 regard
 the
 classic


case
 has
 been
 the
 entire
 southern


countries.
 I
 mean
 as
 you
 know
 that
 the


southern
 European
 countries
 that
 these


countries
 were
 dismissed
 as
 the
 pigs
 a


decade
 ago
 but
 there
 we
 have
 seen
 these


countries
 do
 pretty
 well
 in
 the
 last
 5


years
 or
 so
 because
 I
 think
 that
 they


were
 forced
 to
 sort
 of
 clean
 up
 their


excesses
 and
 the
 government's
 role
 sort


of
 did
 come
 down
 a
 bit
 in
 the
 Greece


Portugal
 Spain
 of
 the
 world


>> but
 I
 I
 will
 challenge
 you
 a
 bit
 there


because
 um
 I
 mean
 how
 much
 do
 they


actually
 have
 the
 the
 back
 against
 the


wall?
 I
 mean
 life
 is
 good
 no
 in
 Europe.


Yeah,
 but
 these
 countries
 did,
 right?
 I


mean,


>> yeah,
 they
 did.
 But
 I
 mean,
 let's
 say
 in


Germany
 and
 France
 and
 you
 know,
 um,


Italy,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 Northern
 Europe,


there
 is
 no
 wall
 again,
 there
 is
 no
 back


against
 the
 wall
 there,
 right?


>> Yes,
 it's
 broadly
 correct,
 but
 good


life.


>> I
 think
 we
 saw
 like
 a
 bit
 of
 that
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 year
 because
 there
 was


so
 much
 pessimism
 and
 Trump
 and
 all
 were


sort
 of
 really
 going
 after
 Europe.


>> So,
 how
 much
 So,
 how
 much
 worse
 does
 the


situation
 need
 to
 be
 before
 they
 take


tougher
 measures?


>> Well,
 unless
 you
 unless
 you
 get
 a


crisis,
 no
 one
 does
 anything.
 But


>> and
 how
 big
 a
 crisis
 does
 it
 need
 to


Well,
 it
 needs
 to
 be
 that
 you
 just
 run


out
 of
 money
 to
 spend,
 right?
 That's
 the


basic
 definition
 that
 it's
 only
 there.


But
 I
 think
 that
 there
 was
 a
 bit
 of
 an


existential
 crisis
 feel
 I
 got
 at
 the


beginning
 of
 the
 year
 which
 is
 that
 in


places
 like
 Germany
 and
 all
 that
 there


was
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 feel
 as
 you
 know
 you
 know


in
 places
 like
 Davos
 and
 stuff
 and


everybody
 was
 just
 so
 depressed
 about


Europe
 and
 everybody
 had
 written
 Europe


off
 and
 it's
 sort
 of
 interesting
 as
 an


investor
 as
 you
 know
 what's
 happened


this
 year
 has
 been
 you
 know
 quite


fascinating
 right
 which
 is
 the
 fact
 that


in
 fact
 America
 is
 you
 know
 being
 the
 at


least
 in
 relative
 basis
 the
 worst


performing
 region
 in
 the
 world
 uh
 Europe


>> very
 very
 surprising
 right
 Yeah,
 because


everybody
 was
 onto
 the
 American


exceptionalism
 trade
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


the
 year
 that
 that
 was
 supposed
 to
 be


that
 you
 know
 this
 is
 like
 the
 only


place
 in
 the
 world
 worth
 investing
 and


instead
 in
 fact
 what
 we
 have
 found
 this


year
 is
 that
 Europe
 emerging
 markets,


China,
 everyone
 has
 outperformed


America.


>> Why
 has
 this
 happened?
 I
 think
 that
 one


was
 the
 starting
 point
 which
 that
 things


that
 you
 know
 the
 entire
 money
 was
 piled


into
 one
 region
 and
 uh
 one
 country
 in
 a


way
 in
 a
 way
 it
 never
 was
 as
 you
 know


that
 America
 their
 weight
 in
 the
 uh
 MCI


equity
 indices
 uh
 was
 hitting
 nearly
 70%


by
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 year
 the
 dollar


also
 got
 very
 overvalued
 so
 I
 think
 that


some
 of
 this
 is
 just
 corrective
 but
 two


I
 think
 is
 also
 because
 some
 of
 these


countries
 are
 doing
 stuff
 to
 finally


carry
 out
 some
 reforms
 I
 mean
 Again
 in


Europe
 expectations
 are
 very
 low
 but
 at


least
 the
 Germanies
 of
 the
 world
 began


to
 wake
 up
 and
 said
 okay
 we
 need
 to
 do


something
 here
 to
 shift
 whether
 it's
 you


know
 more
 sort
 of
 uh
 spending
 on
 the


right
 things
 or
 some
 sort
 of
 you
 know


like
 uh
 focus
 on
 labor
 markets
 reforms


and
 deregulation
 on
 the
 other
 hand
 many


like
 China
 I
 think
 there
 was
 a
 very


important
 pivot
 in
 China
 realized
 that


listen
 if
 we
 have
 to
 compete
 with


America
 on
 AI
 we
 need
 to
 back
 the


private
 sector
 again
 because
 the
 big


shift
 in
 China
 which
 had
 happened
 was


that
 the
 it
 was
 a
 hostile
 attitude


towards
 the
 private
 sector
 which
 Gi


Jinping
 had
 taken
 but
 I
 think
 that
 there


was
 a
 very
 important
 pivot
 there
 you


know
 so
 now
 Jackmar
 is
 back
 at
 Alibaba


in
 terms
 of
 driving
 stuff
 and
 Alibaba's


stock
 has
 doubled
 this
 year


>> what
 do
 you
 think
 made
 the
 change
 what


made
 the
 change
 happen


>> well
 the
 economy
 in
 China
 is
 in
 big


trouble
 outside
 of
 AI
 that
 if
 you
 take


AI
 out
 in
 China
 like
 the
 economy
 is
 not


doing
 well
 at
 all
 the
 property
 market
 is


bust
 uh
 you
 know
 there
 are
 like
 reports


about
 uh
 how
 businesses
 consumers
 or
 you


know
 like
 all
 are
 feeling
 very
 stressed


and
 I
 think
 that
 the
 whole
 idea
 what


China
 also
 was
 a
 bit
 existential
 which


is
 that
 their
 path
 to
 compete
 with


America
 was
 on
 AI
 uh
 and
 and
 on
 tech
 and


that's
 where
 we've
 seen
 this
 massive


catchup
 take
 place
 out
 there.
 I
 think


that
 you
 know
 like
 we
 saw
 that
 the


deepseek
 moment
 in
 January
 was
 a
 you


know
 like
 uh
 you
 know
 was
 a
 very


important
 moment
 at
 the
 beginning
 of


this
 year
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 what's
 like


happened
 in
 China
 too
 which
 is
 that
 this


uh
 so
 it
 was
 two
 things
 right
 one
 that


the
 economy
 was
 in
 big
 trouble
 and
 two


that
 Xi
 Jinping
 realized
 that
 listen
 AI


is
 the
 big
 thing
 and
 tech
 is
 the
 big


thing
 and
 and
 they
 have
 a
 very
 good
 tech


sector
 are
 you
 surprised
 we
 haven't
 seen


more
 follow-up
 after
 deepseek
 because


that
 was
 like
 a
 total
 wakeup
 call
 uh
 the


AI
 stocks
 in
 the
 US
 you
 know
 uh
 reacted


quite
 dramatically.


>> Yes.


>> And
 then
 recovered
 and
 we
 kind
 of


forgotten
 about
 the
 Chinese
 abilities


again.


>> Absolutely.
 Because
 today
 if
 you


>> It's
 not
 like
 they
 stopped
 working
 on


it.


>> No,
 but
 in
 fact
 today
 by
 some
 metrics


the
 Chinese
 uh
 LLM
 models
 like
 have


reached
 virtual
 convergence
 by
 with
 the


US
 and
 they've
 spent
 they're
 spending


about
 1/5
 the
 amount
 right
 because
 the


capex
 spend
 in
 America
 is
 touching
 about


half
 a
 trillion.
 In
 China,
 the
 capic


spend
 on
 AI
 is
 close
 to
 100
 billion.
 So,


you
 know,
 like
 there
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 that.


But
 I
 think
 in
 America,
 what's
 happened


is
 the
 fact
 that,
 you
 know,
 like
 there's


so
 much
 faith
 in
 like
 AI
 and
 that
 this


is
 going
 to
 work
 and
 people
 are
 willing


to
 put
 all
 sorts
 of
 capital
 behind
 it


that
 I
 think
 that
 that
 questioning
 is


not
 happening.
 That
 questioning
 really,


Nicola,
 will
 happen
 whenever
 interest


rates
 go
 up.
 Every
 single
 bubble
 or


mania
 in
 history
 has
 been
 pricricked
 by


just
 one
 factor,
 which
 is
 when
 interest


rates
 finally
 go
 up.
 Why
 should
 I
 go
 up


now?


>> Well,
 if
 inflation
 comes
 back,


>> why
 should
 inflation
 come
 back?


>> Well,
 if
 the
 economy
 remains,
 you
 know,


so
 strong
 in
 terms
 of
 that,
 then
 there


is
 uh
 firstly
 inflation
 is
 already
 quite


sticky
 out
 here
 as
 you
 know
 that
 the


Fed's
 2%
 target
 is
 nowhere
 in
 sight.
 The


Fed
 has
 missed
 it
 2%
 target
 for
 5
 years


in
 a
 row
 and
 even
 next
 year
 inflation


seems
 to
 be
 uh
 closer
 to
 3%
 rather
 than


2%.
 the
 Fed
 is
 why
 the
 Fed
 is
 cutting


interest
 rates
 in
 this
 environment
 is


completely
 bewildering
 to
 me,
 but


they're
 doing
 it.
 Maybe
 it's
 under


pressure
 from
 the
 White
 House.
 Maybe


this
 is
 the
 Fed's
 historical
 reaction


function,
 which
 is
 that
 they
 will
 react


to
 uh
 the
 slightest
 hint
 of
 trouble,
 but


never
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 react
 when


things
 are
 going
 really
 well
 and
 stuff


like
 that.
 And
 we've
 seen
 it
 even
 now,


which
 is
 that
 it's
 very
 interesting
 last


few
 days,
 if
 you
 if
 you
 see
 what's


happened
 that
 the
 Fed
 has
 begun
 to


question
 whether
 they
 should
 be
 cutting


interest
 rates.
 And
 that's
 the
 main


reason
 why
 the
 markets
 had
 a
 bit
 of a


wobble.
 But
 again,
 just
 as
 the
 market


had
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 wobble,
 the
 Fed
 is
 now


again
 sending
 signals
 that
 yes,
 a


December
 rate
 cut
 may
 be
 on.
 It
 just


tells
 you
 what
 the
 reaction
 function
 is.


But
 if
 inflation,
 you
 know,
 were
 to


accelerate
 from
 here
 because
 the
 economy


remains
 relatively
 strong
 driven
 by
 this


massive
 uh
 capex
 spend
 on
 AI
 and
 stuff


and
 the
 Fed
 says,
 "Okay,
 we
 need
 to


raise
 interest
 rates
 now
 because
 or
 we


can't
 cut
 interest
 rates
 the
 way
 that


they
 want
 us
 to
 because
 we
 ha
 because
 we


have
 an
 affordability
 problem
 in
 this


country."
 I
 think
 that
 that's
 when
 this


entire
 overinvestment
 AI
 bubble
 will


burst.


>> What
 are
 your
 thoughts
 on
 a
 less


independent
 Fed?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that
 the
 less
 independent


Fed
 Okay,
 so
 the
 two
 things
 here
 um


should
 the
 Fed
 be
 reformed?
 I
 think


there
 is
 a
 case
 to
 reforming
 the
 Fed,


but
 I'm
 in
 the
 opposite
 direction
 which


is
 that
 the
 there
 were
 two
 issues
 with


the
 Fed
 here.
 Uh
 one
 issue
 was
 the
 fact


of
 this
 asymmetry
 which
 I've
 spoken


about
 which
 is
 that
 like
 on
 the
 downside


we're
 here
 to
 protect
 you.
 on
 the
 upside


you
 know
 you
 can
 do
 whatever
 you
 feel


like
 so
 you
 capitalize
 the
 gains
 and
 we


we'll
 socialize
 your
 losses
 I
 think


that's
 an
 asymmetry
 which
 I
 think
 needs


to
 shift
 the
 second
 thing
 is
 the
 Fed


needs
 to
 be
 held
 responsible
 that
 if
 you


look
 at
 it
 since
 2000
 in
 fact
 the
 Fed


has
 missed
 its
 inflation
 target
 on
 a


cumulative
 basis
 now
 by
 a
 you
 know


pretty
 significant
 margin
 if
 you
 just
 do


a
 straight
 line
 of
 of
 uh
 2%
 inflation


versus
 what
 the
 Fed
 has
 actually


achieved
 so
 it
 should
 be
 held


accountable
 for
 that
 so
 that's
 reform
 of


the
 Fed
 and
 the
 other
 aspect
 which
 I


think
 some
 of
 the
 people
 have
 spoken
 to


is
 that
 the
 mission
 creep
 needs
 to
 end


that
 the
 Fed
 can't
 be
 doing
 everything


and
 anything
 uh
 you
 know
 like


intervening
 in
 all
 markets
 or
 even


getting
 into
 things
 uh
 outside
 the
 scope


of
 monetary
 policy
 uh
 you
 as
 defined


here.
 So,
 one,
 I
 think
 that
 it
 is
 true


that
 the
 Fed
 needs
 to
 be
 reformed,
 but


this
 idea
 that
 the
 reform
 means
 a
 less


independent
 Fed,
 and
 I'm
 not
 sure
 what


that
 means.
 As
 I
 said,
 like
 I
 haven't


been
 a
 big
 fan
 of
 Fed
 policy.
 So,
 I'm


all
 for
 reforming
 the
 Fed,
 but
 if


reforming
 the
 Fed
 just
 means
 that
 you


just
 want
 to
 cut
 interest
 rates
 because


that's
 going
 to
 lower
 your
 debt
 burden,


I
 think
 that
 that
 is
 the
 wrong
 policy.


So,
 there's
 a
 big
 uh
 difference
 between


independence
 and
 reform.
 You
 previously


have
 warned
 about
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 high


levels
 of
 uh
 government
 debts
 around
 the


world.
 How
 do
 you
 see
 that
 now?


>> Well,
 it's
 played
 out
 this
 year


everywhere
 except
 America
 that
 we've
 had


sort
 of
 in
 UK,
 Japan,
 uh
 e
 France,
 in


all
 these
 places
 the
 incredible
 debt


burden
 that
 these
 countries
 have
 at
 some


point
 in
 time
 has
 come
 to
 be
 an
 issue


and
 they've
 been
 forced
 to
 react
 to
 it


in
 all
 these
 places
 in
 some
 way


particularly.


>> Why
 why
 has
 it
 not
 become
 an
 issue
 in


the
 US?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 for
 two
 reasons.
 one
 that


there
 is
 incredible
 faith
 I
 think
 in
 AI


and
 it's
 playing
 out
 in
 two
 ways.
 One


that
 because
 of
 the
 faith
 in
 AI
 there's


so
 much
 money
 which
 is
 still
 flowing


into
 America
 uh
 like
 is
 happening.
 Two


there
 is
 an
 implicit
 bet
 that
 the
 that


because
 America
 is
 at
 the
 leading
 edge


of
 AI
 that
 there'll
 be
 big
 productivity


improvements
 in
 America
 and
 those
 high


productivity
 improvements
 will
 help


stabilize
 the
 debt
 to
 GDP
 burden.
 And


the
 third
 thing
 I
 think
 which
 has
 been


the
 big
 surprise
 to
 most
 of
 us
 is
 that


actually
 this
 year
 in
 America
 the


deficit
 as
 a
 share
 of
 GDP
 while
 very


high
 still
 has
 actually
 come
 down


>> partly
 because
 of
 tariffs.


>> Tariffs.
 Exactly.
 So
 I
 think
 that's


>> tariffs
 they
 they
 are
 profitable.


>> Yeah.
 Well


>> in
 the
 short
 term
 at
 least


>> at
 the
 surface.
 So
 tariff
 revenues
 have


helped
 bring
 the
 deficit
 down
 by
 1%
 of


GDP.


>> So
 no
 now
 if
 you
 took
 away
 the
 tariffs


do
 you
 think
 it
 would
 be
 good
 news
 or


bad
 news
 for
 markets?
 I
 think
 that
 if


you
 took
 away
 the
 tariffs,
 the
 concern


on
 the
 deficit
 would
 come
 back
 a
 bit


just
 like


>> more
 more
 than
 the
 uh
 positive
 effect
 of


>> Yeah,
 but
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 tariffs
 are


going
 to
 come
 out,
 you
 know,
 completely.


But
 I
 think
 that
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 fact


that
 as
 I
 said
 that
 it's
 not
 as
 if


tariffs
 have
 not
 had
 a
 negative
 effect


this
 year.
 The
 point
 I've
 made
 is
 yes,


tariffs
 have
 had
 a
 negative
 effect
 on


economic
 growth.
 it's
 just
 been
 offset


in
 a
 huge
 way
 by
 the
 optimism
 at
 least


uh
 among
 businesses
 on
 spending
 and


stuff
 on
 AI.


>> So
 tariffs
 are
 having
 a
 negative
 effect


on
 economic
 growth
 just
 that
 we
 don't


think
 it's
 having
 a
 negative
 effect
 so


much
 because
 at
 an
 overall
 economic


perspective
 the
 positive
 spend
 from
 AI


is
 offsetting
 the
 damage
 being
 caused
 by


tariffs.


>> What
 has
 changed
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the


rivalry
 between
 China
 and
 the
 US
 over


the
 last
 year?
 I
 think
 that
 the
 uh


realization
 that
 there
 is
 especially
 in


America
 that
 there's
 much
 more


dependence
 on
 China
 than
 they
 had


expected
 right
 because
 at
 the
 beginning


of
 the
 year
 the
 calculation
 among
 most


people
 was
 that
 uh
 China
 is
 the
 big
 uh


exporter
 and
 they
 need
 the
 American


market
 come
 what
 may.
 So
 it
 almost


seemed
 as
 if
 all
 the
 bargaining
 chips


were
 with
 America.
 But
 I
 think
 that
 what


we
 have
 learned
 in
 the
 last
 few
 months


is
 that
 China
 too
 has
 its
 bargaining


chips
 whether
 it's
 the
 rare
 earths
 uh


you
 know
 uh
 uh
 advantage
 that
 it
 has.
 So


I
 think
 what's
 changed
 is
 the
 fact
 that


there
 remains
 deep
 distrust
 but
 I
 think


that
 people
 like
 Trump
 are
 you
 know
 uh


quite
 transactional
 and
 and
 they
 also


realize
 what
 the
 independence


is.
 So
 I
 think
 what's
 changed
 in
 the
 two


countries
 is
 a
 realization
 that
 there's


much
 more
 dependence
 uh
 and
 and
 you
 just


can't
 wish
 that
 away.


>> Richard,
 lastly
 uh
 if
 you
 were
 to


predict
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 over
 the


next
 uh
 12
 months.
 So
 uh
 what
 are
 the


most
 important
 things?


>> I'm
 thinking
 about
 that
 as
 you
 know


every
 year
 I
 write
 about
 my
 top
 10


trends
 of
 the
 year
 and
 I
 was
 just


putting
 some
 thought
 to
 that.
 So
 I
 think


>> so
 you
 can
 share
 it
 with
 us.
 Well,
 I


think
 that
 the
 big
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 be


that
 how
 much
 this
 a
 like
 it's
 all
 about


AI,
 right?
 As
 to
 how
 much
 it's
 going
 to


sort
 of
 uh
 wobble
 and
 is
 this
 bubble


going
 to
 burst
 in
 26.
 That's
 the
 really


big
 question.
 my
 my
 get
 you
 know
 like
 as


you
 know
 these
 things
 uh
 having
 done


this
 for
 so
 long
 which
 is
 that
 to


predict
 exactly
 when
 a
 bubble
 will
 burst


is
 impossible
 but
 you
 know
 there's
 a


checklist
 that
 you
 can
 keep
 that
 you


know
 we're
 having
 so
 at
 the
 slightest


sign
 that
 interest
 rates
 are
 going
 to
 go


up
 I
 think
 is
 your
 sign
 that
 okay
 this


is
 done
 now
 now
 you
 can
 be
 a
 very
 smart


investor
 which
 some
 people
 are
 and
 say


I'm
 going
 to
 wait
 for
 that
 sign
 and
 I'm


going
 to
 wait
 for
 that
 bubble
 to
 burst


before
 I
 actually
 exit
 this
 or
 there's


something
 else
 which
 I
 found
 and
 let
 me


tease
 this
 because
 I
 think
 that
 if


there's
 you
 know
 there
 are
 times
 when


you
 have
 a
 moment
 of
 epiphany
 that
 this


is
 the
 single
 best
 investment
 idea
 and
 I


and
 I
 was
 doing
 some
 work
 on
 this
 and
 uh


just
 to
 tease
 it
 out
 as
 one
 of the
 big


trends
 I
 think
 of
 26
 you
 know
 that
 there


has
 never
 been
 a
 better
 time
 to
 buy


quality
 stocks
 in
 fact


uh
 that
 quality
 stocks
 have
 done
 so


poorly
 in
 the
 last
 12
 months
 quality
 as


you
 know
 as
 a
 factor
 has
 really


underperformed


>> yeah
 and
 typically
 characterized
 by
 by


growth,
 high
 return
 on
 investments.


>> Exactly.
 You
 know,
 very
 high
 ROE,
 low


leverage,
 and
 also
 like
 uh
 you
 can


screen
 for
 some
 valuation
 and
 growth


criteria.
 So,
 what
 I
 found
 is
 that
 the


last
 12
 months
 have
 been
 one
 of
 the


worst
 runs
 that
 quality
 stocks
 have
 had


uh
 in
 recorded
 history.
 So,
 this
 could


be
 a
 great
 time.
 You
 know,
 there's
 so


much
 hand
 ringing
 like
 in
 our
 industry,


which
 is
 that
 okay,
 okay,
 what
 should
 we


buy?
 you
 know
 like
 on
 one
 hand
 like


everything
 looks
 so
 expensive
 because
 of


uh
 the
 AI
 bubble
 and
 stuff
 on
 the
 other


hand
 even
 some
 of
 the
 insurance
 like


gold
 and
 all
 have
 run
 up
 so
 much
 so
 you


know
 we
 can't
 put
 more
 money
 there
 like


what
 should
 we
 do
 you
 know
 there's


always
 this


>> okay
 so
 one
 prediction
 so
 uh
 is
 is
 that


a
 prediction
 that
 quality
 stocks
 will


come
 back
 in
 favor


>> yeah
 I
 think
 quality
 stocks
 will
 come


back
 in
 favor
 I
 think
 that
 you
 should


just
 buy
 quality
 and
 uh
 and
 like
 you


know
 like
 sit
 if
 that
 was
 the
 one
 big


thing
 if
 if
 I
 had
 to
 do
 So
 that's
 going


to
 be
 so
 I
 think
 that
 as
 I
 said
 I
 do


feel
 at
 some
 point
 in
 time
 next
 year
 the


AI
 uh
 bubble
 ends
 in
 some
 way
 possibly


because
 of
 higher
 interest
 rates
 exact


timing
 I
 don't
 know
 but
 and
 buying


quality
 stocks
 in
 general
 coming
 back
 in


favor
 I
 think
 is
 the
 other
 big
 thing


that
 I
 can
 think
 about
 and
 the
 third


thing
 I
 do
 feel
 is
 that
 you
 know
 this
 uh


trend
 of
 international
 markets


outperforming
 the
 US
 I
 think
 that
 this


these
 tend
 to
 be
 multi-year
 trends
 once


they
 begin
 and
 uh
 I
 don't
 think
 that


2025
 was
 just
 a
 flash
 in
 the
 pan.
 So,
 I


think
 that
 this
 trend
 of
 international


doing
 better
 than
 the
 US,
 I
 think
 is
 a


trend
 that
 will
 continue
 in
 uh
 2026.


Very
 good,
 Richard.
 I
 look
 forward
 to


coming
 back
 in
 November
 next
 year
 and
 we


will
 uh
 go
 through
 these
 predictions
 and


see
 how
 it
 went.


>> Great.
 Thanks.
 Fantastic.
 Thank
 you.
