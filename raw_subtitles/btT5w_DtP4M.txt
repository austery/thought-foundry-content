>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 Odd
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.
 Joe,
 there
 are


so
 many
 huge
 stories
 that
 you
 could
 pull


out
 of
 this
 year,
 but
 I
 mean
 like
 some


actually
 really
 really
 big
 ones.
 So
 we


had
 liberation
 day
 and
 the
 market
 crash.


>> We
 had
 the
 continued
 weakness
 in
 the
 US


dollar
 which
 has
 been
 this
 sort
 of
 slow


burn
 crash
 across
 the
 year.
 Um
 and
 we're


recording
 this
 let's
 see
 October
 17th


and
 you
 know
 dollar
 down
 yet
 again.


Although
 it
 is
 down,
 but
 however,


there's
 been
 a
 little,
 you
 know,
 we
 hit


it
 low
 in
 midseptember.


>> Don't
 make
 apologies
 for
 the
 dollar,


Joe.


>> No,
 you
 know,
 I
 just
 like
 keep
 going
 and


then
 I'm


>> all
 right.


>> Keep
 going.
 Then
 I
 might
 add
 something.


>> Fall
 in
 the
 dollar.


>> Yeah,
 there's
 that.
 The
 fall
 in
 the


dollar
 is
 very
 big
 in
 so
 far
 this
 year.


>> But
 this
 huge
 ramp
 up
 in
 the
 price
 of


gold,
 which
 seems
 to
 hit
 a
 new
 record


all
 the
 time.
 And
 then
 we've
 had
 the


continued
 strength
 slash
 resilience,


whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it,
 enthusiasm


about
 AI
 and
 the
 stock
 market.
 And
 it


really
 seems
 like
 there's
 this
 division


at
 the
 moment
 between
 how
 people
 feel


about
 corporate
 America
 and
 how
 people


feel
 about
 sovereign
 America
 in
 the
 form


of
 its
 currency.


>> You
 know what
 I
 really
 regret
 doing,


Tracy?


>> I
 I
 really
 regret.


>> Did
 you
 have
 like
 a
 hoarde
 of
 gold
 that


you
 got
 rid
 of
 or
 something?


>> No.
 No.
 I I
 took
 out
 a
 gold
 denominated


mortgage.
 You
 know,
 I
 feel
 so
 stupid.
 I


feel
 so
 stupid.
 Why
 did
 I
 do
 that?
 I


could
 have
 I
 get
 paid
 in
 dollars
 and
 I


took
 out
 a
 gold
 denominated
 mortgage.


What
 was
 I
 thinking?
 No,
 I
 didn't.
 But


had
 I
 done
 it,
 that
 would
 have
 been
 a


very
 bad
 trade.


>> Yes.


>> Remember
 those
 stories
 from
 like,
 you


know,
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 tangent.


Remember
 all
 those
 stories
 from
 like
 the


Hungarians?
 They
 took
 out
 those
 Swiss


denominated
 mortgages
 back
 in
 the
 2000s.


And
 then


>> that
 was
 very
 much
 a
 Europe
 thing
 for
 a


while.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 That
 was
 a
 really
 funny
 little
 We


don't
 have
 to
 talk
 about
 that.
 the
 but


one
 thing
 I
 was
 just
 ju
 the
 only
 reason


I
 caveed
 the
 dollar
 fall
 which
 I
 do


think
 the
 it
 has
 it
 is
 quite
 a
 bit
 down


from
 the
 beginning
 of
 the
 year.
 All
 that


being
 said
 it
 is
 striking
 in
 the
 last


several
 weeks
 the
 degree
 to
 which
 a
 few


of
 the
 very
 popular
 consensus
 ideas
 for


this
 year
 are
 turning
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 I


say
 that
 10ear
 Treasury
 as
 the
 time


we're
 recording
 this
 October
 17th
 has


fallen
 below
 4%.
 How
 many
 times
 did
 you


hear
 about
 the
 steepener
 trade
 this


year?
 How
 many
 times
 did
 you
 hear
 about


fiscal
 dominance
 losing
 control
 at
 the


long
 end?
 Um
 the
 dollar
 it
 stabilized
 a


little
 bit.
 So
 it
 is
 a
 very
 interesting


moment
 uh
 for
 markets
 in
 many
 respects


right
 now.


>> There's
 definitely
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.


Congrats
 on
 managing
 your
 personal
 FX


liabilities.


>> I'm
 doing
 a
 good
 job.
 Uh
 yeah,


>> getting
 paid
 in
 dollars
 and
 paying
 your


mortgage
 in
 dollars.
 Well
 done,
 Joe.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 you
 know,
 this
 is
 the


kind
 of
 thing
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 big


investors
 are
 thinking
 about
 at
 the


moment.
 And
 uh
 we
 should
 definitely


think
 about
 it
 too.
 And
 who
 is
 the
 one


person
 that
 we
 really
 like
 to
 talk
 to?


>> There
 could
 only
 be
 one


>> when
 we
 talk
 about
 these
 big
 trends.


>> And
 who
 is
 the
 one
 person
 that
 is
 always


in
 town?
 Cuz
 we're
 in
 Washington
 DC


right
 now.
 When
 we
 go
 to
 a
 new
 town,
 who


is
 the
 other
 guy
 who
 always
 is
 probably


going
 to
 be
 there
 at
 the
 same
 time?


>> The
 person
 that
 we
 run
 into
 on
 the


street
 in
 various
 outfits.
 Although
 this


time
 you're
 wearing
 a
 suit.
 So
 there
 we


go.
 The
 last
 time
 we
 ran
 into
 you


randomly,
 you
 were
 wearing
 hiking
 gear.


And
 so
 were
 we.
 Anyway,
 we
 are
 here
 in


DC.
 We
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest
 as
 always.


We
 are
 speaking
 once
 again
 with
 Hunin.


He
 is
 the
 economic
 adviser
 and
 head
 of


the
 monetary
 and
 economic
 department
 at


the
 Bank
 for
 International
 Settlements,


the
 BIS.
 We
 love
 talking
 to
 him
 and
 it's


so
 great
 to
 have
 him
 here
 to
 talk
 about


something
 that's
 really
 been
 on
 the


minds
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 market
 participants,
 a


lot
 of
 policy
 makers
 right
 now.
 So
 Hun,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 back
 on


OddLots.


>> Thank
 you
 Tracy.
 Thank
 you
 Joe.
 It's


great
 to
 be
 back.
 Since
 Joe
 doubts
 my


entire
 premise
 for
 this
 episode,


>> doubt
 the
 entire
 premise
 at
 all.


>> No,
 let's
 just
 start
 with
 how
 unusual


would
 you
 say
 this
 year
 has
 been?
 And
 I


feel
 like
 so
 much
 has
 happened.
 We
 kind


of
 have
 to
 cast
 our
 minds
 back
 to
 April


when
 we
 did
 have
 liberation
 day
 and
 when


we
 did
 see
 the
 dollar
 fall
 as
 the
 market


was
 selling
 off,
 which
 was
 something


that's
 not
 really
 supposed
 to
 happen.


you're
 supposed
 to
 have
 investors
 reach


for
 the
 safe
 haven
 of
 the
 greenback
 in


times
 of
 turmoil
 and
 stress.
 And
 now,


you
 know,
 fast
 forward
 to
 October,
 I


think
 we've
 gotten
 a
 little
 bit
 more


used
 to
 that
 particular
 dynamic.
 But
 how


surprised
 were
 you
 at
 that
 time?


>> Well,
 it
 was
 a
 very
 unusual
 um


combination
 of
 events
 uh
 in
 in
 April.


So,
 what
 we
 saw
 was
 the
 so-called
 triple


decline
 where
 you
 had
 stocks,
 bonds,
 and


the
 dollar


>> falling
 in
 unison.
 And
 that's
 very


unusual
 because
 um
 in
 a
 riskoff
 episode


you
 know
 which
 April
 was
 um
 typically


the
 the
 dollar
 would
 rally
 uh
 you
 know


there
 would
 be
 a
 kind
 of
 safe
 haven
 flow


and
 uh
 you
 know
 back
 then
 uh
 there
 was


of
 course
 a
 lot
 of
 news
 and
 you
 saw
 a


lot
 of
 stories
 uh
 back
 then
 about
 you


know
 possibly
 the
 dollar
 uh
 you
 know


losing
 its
 international
 status
 and
 so


on.
 I
 think
 in
 retrospect
 that
 was
 you


know
 uh
 quite
 hasty
 and
 I
 think
 now
 that


we
 have
 the
 data
 we
 can
 piece
 together


uh
 in
 a
 more
 kind
 of
 coherent
 way
 what


was
 going
 on
 and
 um


in
 in
 short
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 kind
 of
 uh


hedging
 story
 uh
 where
 investors
 who
 had


uh
 lots
 of
 exposures
 uh
 to
 the
 US
 dollar


were
 trying
 to
 reduce
 some
 of
 those


exposures
 and
 we
 can
 get
 into
 some
 of


the
 details
 on
 how
 you
 know
 that
 kind


trade
 might
 uh
 transpire.
 And
 um
 it
 just


so
 happens
 that
 this
 is
 also
 the
 year


that
 the
 BIS
 conducts
 its
 uh
 triannual


survey
 of
 uh
 of
 FX
 markets
 and
 we've


just
 published
 the
 results
 and
 I
 think


we
 can
 also
 um
 shed
 some
 more
 light
 on


the
 events
 in
 April.
 Let's
 keep
 it
 big


picture
 still
 and
 then
 we'll
 drive
 down


into
 specific
 months
 and
 weeks.
 What
 is


people
 work
 for
 the
 BIS?
 They
 probably


must
 take
 out
 uh
 mortgages
 and
 Swiss


Frank,
 but
 living
 there
 in
 Basel.


Anyway,
 sidetrack.
 What
 are
 some
 of
 the


big
 takeaways
 from
 this
 year's
 survey?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 So,
 I
 think
 well
 actually


before
 we
 go
 there.


>> Sure.


>> Uh
 Joe,
 um
 uh
 I
 mean
 it's
 worth,
 you


know,
 thinking
 about
 how


>> uh
 FX
 markets
 really
 figure
 in
 the


investment
 strategy.
 So,
 you
 know,
 if


you're
 a
 long-term
 investor,
 let's
 say


that
 you're
 a
 Euro
 area
 pension
 fund.


What
 you
 have
 are
 obligations
 to
 your
 uh


you
 know,
 local
 uh


>> in
 euros.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 beneficiaries
 in
 euros,


but
 you
 have
 a
 very
 large
 balance
 sheet


and
 so
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a
 very
 broad


exposure
 to
 global
 assets,
 you
 know,


including
 those
 in
 non-
 euro
 denominated


assets.
 So
 what
 tends
 to
 happen
 is
 um
 uh


some
 of
 the
 euros
 are
 then
 converted


into
 dollars
 to
 to
 invest
 in
 in
 uh
 in


dollar
 assets.
 But
 of
 course
 what
 you


want
 to
 do
 is
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 uh
 you


hedge
 that
 currency
 risk.
 And
 this
 is


where
 this
 instrument
 called
 an
 FX
 swap


uh
 really
 comes
 into
 its
 own.
 And
 it's


an
 operation
 where
 essentially
 uh
 the


Euro
 area
 investor
 pledges
 some
 euros


and
 then
 borrows
 dollars
 and
 then
 with


those
 dollars
 then
 go
 into
 dollar


denominated
 assets
 and
 as
 you
 do
 that


you
 uh
 also
 promise
 to
 unwind
 that


transaction
 at
 a
 known
 exchange
 rate
 at


a
 fixed
 uh
 you
 know
 moment
 in
 the


future.
 So
 essentially
 once
 you've
 gone


through
 that
 transaction
 um
 your
 uh


currency
 risk
 is
 hedged.
 Now
 exactly
 how


much
 of
 your
 foreign
 portfolio
 you
 hedge


in
 this
 way
 that
 varies
 over
 time.
 I


mean
 it
 depends
 for
 example
 on
 um
 you


know
 how
 high
 the
 the
 hedging
 costs
 are


because
 you're
 uh
 typically
 doing
 this


fairly
 short
 term
 and
 you're
 rolling


over
 these
 hedges.
 Uh
 what's
 important


is
 the
 short-term
 dollar
 interest
 rate


because
 you
 know
 you're
 borrowing


dollars
 in
 order
 to
 uh
 invest
 in
 dollar


assets.
 So
 when
 the
 short-term
 interest


rate
 is
 very
 high,
 that's
 uh
 typically
 a


time
 when
 hedging
 costs
 are
 very
 high.


And
 so
 uh
 what
 had
 happened
 over
 the


last
 few
 years
 was
 that
 these
 so-called


hedge
 ratios,
 you
 know,
 the
 proportion


of
 your
 assets
 that
 you
 actually
 hedge


had
 been
 really
 you
 know
 uh
 trending


down
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 to
 the
 extent
 that


some
 investors
 you
 know
 didn't
 hedge
 at


all
 and
 why
 would
 you
 if
 the
 dollar
 is


surging
 and
 the
 hedging
 cost
 is
 so


large.
 And
 so
 when
 the
 turbulence
 broke


earlier
 in
 the
 year,
 a
 lot
 of
 investors


were
 basically
 caught
 uh
 with
 very
 large


dollar
 exposures,
 you
 know,
 having
 not


hedged.


And
 I
 think
 one
 piece
 of
 evidence
 that


uh
 you
 know
 this
 was
 uh
 that
 the
 events


of
 April
 was
 very
 much
 an
 expos
 hedging


story
 you
 know
 hedging
 after
 the
 fact


was
 that
 you
 know
 we
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 uh


telltale
 signs
 of
 swaps
 being
 taken
 out


and
 dollars
 being
 sold
 uh
 happening
 in


the
 market.
 So
 what
 would
 happen
 is
 um


you
 know
 if
 an
 investor
 is
 holding


dollar
 assets
 you
 know
 without
 a
 hedge


>> Mhm.


>> but
 you're
 concerned
 about
 the
 dollar


falling
 uh
 then
 what
 you
 would
 do
 is
 you


would
 put
 on
 a
 hedge
 expost.
 You
 would


put
 on
 a
 hedge
 after
 the
 event
 and
 you


could
 do
 that
 for
 example
 by
 actually


then
 engaging
 in
 an
 FX
 swap
 right
 there


but
 then
 selling
 uh
 the
 dollars
 that


you've
 acquired.
 So
 rather
 than


investing
 those
 dollars
 into
 dollar


assets,
 you
 simply
 sell
 it
 in
 the
 spot


market.
 What
 that
 kind
 of
 dynamics
 would


would
 imply
 is
 that
 there
 would
 be
 you


know
 lots
 of
 uh
 downward
 pressure
 in


those
 situations
 where
 uh
 institutional


investors
 are
 trying
 to
 you
 know
 raise


their
 hedge
 ratios
 uh
 but
 exposed.
 So


back
 to
 the
 trienal,
 what
 do
 we
 see


there
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 puts
 additional


light
 on
 this
 episode?
 Oh,
 by
 the
 way,


on
 on
 the
 trienal,
 you
 know,
 this
 um
 it


just
 so
 happened
 that
 uh
 the
 sampling


period
 was
 April
 this
 year.


>> Amazing.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 it
 may
 be
 slightly


distorted
 by
 the
 events
 of
 uh
 you
 know,


the
 April
 episode.
 On
 the
 other
 hand,


the
 silver
 lining
 is
 that
 we
 have
 some


great
 data,


>> I
 bet,


>> on
 really
 the
 you
 know,
 the
 events
 of


the
 um
 of
 the
 April
 episode.
 But
 the


headline
 numbers
 are
 really
 quite
 um
 you


know,
 quite
 notable.
 It's
 um
 $9.6
 6


trillion
 daily
 flow.
 This
 is
 like


something
 like
 almost
 30%
 higher
 than


the
 previous
 survey
 in
 22.
 The
 dollar
 is


still
 very
 much
 the
 dominant
 currency.


It's
 uh
 90%
 of
 all
 of
 the
 transactions


have
 the
 dollar
 on
 one
 side.
 It's
 even


higher
 than
 what
 we
 saw
 in
 22.
 So
 you


know
 in
 spite
 of
 the
 the
 the
 survey


being
 affected
 perhaps
 by
 these
 uh
 you


know
 stress
 events
 in
 April
 you
 know
 we


think
 we've
 got
 a
 very
 very
 good
 sort
 of


take.
 One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 noticed


this
 year
 is
 of
 course
 you
 know
 as
 well


as
 the
 FX
 swaps
 which
 is
 by
 far
 the


largest
 segment
 of
 the
 of
 the


transactions.
 We
 also
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 big


increase
 in
 the
 spot
 transactions


and
 also
 outright
 forwards.
 Uh
 so
 let
 me


just
 explain
 that
 for
 your
 listeners.


You
 know
 when
 you
 engage
 in
 a
 in
 an
 FX


swap,
 you
 know,
 we
 uh
 the
 investor
 would


borrow
 dollars
 by
 pledging
 euros
 and


then
 uh
 there's
 also
 a
 promise
 uh
 to


reverse
 that.
 Now
 that
 promise
 is
 called


a
 forward


and
 of
 course
 you
 can
 get
 that
 you
 know


without
 going
 through
 the
 swap.
 we
 can


just
 go
 to
 a
 dealer
 and
 say
 look
 you


know
 just
 uh
 sell
 me
 a
 outright
 forward


so-called
 and
 then
 I
 would
 actually
 then


have
 a
 dollar
 obligation


>> a
 swap
 or
 a
 swap
 is
 like
 a
 spot
 trade


plus
 a
 forward


>> exactly
 it's
 that
 combination
 and
 what


we
 see
 is
 as
 well
 as
 the
 swaps
 we
 see


the
 two
 components
 the
 spot
 and
 the


forward
 being
 very
 very
 large
 this
 year


um
 and
 we
 think
 that
 the
 events
 of
 April


must
 have
 had
 a
 you
 know
 had
 an
 impact


because
 uh
 you
 know
 as
 well
 as
 um


getting
 the
 swap
 and
 selling
 the
 dollars


in
 the
 spot
 market,
 you
 can
 also
 just


ask
 a
 dealer
 for
 a
 forward
 contract,
 but


then
 of
 course
 the
 dealer
 has
 to
 hedge.


So
 there,
 you
 know,
 there's
 going
 to
 be


a
 spot
 sale
 anyway.
 And
 so
 that


combination


uh
 would
 actually
 lead
 you
 to
 a


situation
 where
 both
 a
 spot
 and
 a


forward
 transactions
 go
 up
 a
 lot
 and


that's
 exactly
 what
 we
 see.


>> Interesting.
 So
 this
 is
 another
 piece
 of


the
 evidence
 that
 this
 was
 very
 much


exposed
 hedging.
 And
 let
 me
 mention
 just


two
 other
 things
 on
 this.
 We
 put
 out
 a


bulletin
 earlier
 in
 the
 summer.
 We,
 you


know,
 lay
 out
 all
 the
 other
 pieces
 of


evidence
 that
 we
 could
 uh,
 you
 know,


gather.
 But
 it's
 also
 notable
 that
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 actual
 portfolio
 flow


numbers,
 the
 international
 portfolio


flow
 flow
 numbers,
 there
 was
 no
 real


selling
 in
 April.
 So
 you
 know,
 there
 was


a
 very
 very
 small
 outflow,
 but
 on
 the


scale
 of
 things,
 it
 was
 really
 tiny.


there
 were
 certainly
 no
 um
 you
 know


concerted
 portfolio
 outflows
 you
 know


from
 the
 US.
 So
 that's
 really
 the
 I


think
 perhaps
 the
 most
 um
 you
 know


compelling
 evidence
 that
 the
 so-called


sell
 America
 trade
 was
 not
 uh
 you
 know


was
 not
 the
 story
 behind
 the
 April


episode.


[Music]


Why
 should
 we
 care
 either
 qualitatively


or
 quantitatively
 if
 this
 was
 a
 hedge


America
 story
 and
 not
 a
 sell
 America


story
 outright


>> over
 the
 long
 term?
 It
 is
 possible
 that


you
 know
 long-term
 investors
 would
 then


reassess
 their
 their
 global
 exposures


and
 you
 see
 and
 you
 hear
 a
 lot
 of


anecdotal
 evidence
 that
 uh
 you
 know


these
 conversations
 are
 going
 on
 but
 so


far
 that
 hasn't
 really
 been
 you
 know


translated
 into
 actions
 but
 I
 think
 what


um
 you
 know
 does
 uh
 flow
 very
 you
 know


clearly
 from
 you
 know
 from
 the
 actions


in
 the
 spring
 is
 that
 when
 we
 look
 at


the
 various
 pieces
 of
 the
 global


financial
 system
 every
 part
 you
 know


depends
 on
 other
 parts.


And
 there
 is
 this
 network
 effect
 where


provided
 that
 everyone
 else
 is
 doing


what
 they're
 doing
 uh
 around
 the
 US


dollar
 then
 it's
 also
 in
 my
 interest
 to


actually
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 be
 part
 of
 that


you
 know
 ecosystem.
 So
 if
 you
 have
 this


kind
 of
 neo
 network
 effect
 it's
 very


difficult
 to
 you
 know
 have
 this


wholesale
 shift
 away.
 One
 of
 the
 things


that
 I
 think
 is
 unusual
 and
 I
 I
 probably


said
 this
 in
 a
 few
 other
 episodes,
 but


what
 I
 think
 is
 striking
 about
 this


environment
 is
 that
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


US,
 I
 can
 come
 up
 with
 a
 long
 list
 of


reasons
 to
 be
 concerned,
 which
 we
 don't


need
 to
 um
 come
 down
 uh
 recapitulate.


Now,
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 the
 most


profitable,
 impressive,
 cutting
 edge


companies
 in
 the
 world
 that
 everyone


would
 love
 to
 have
 exposure
 to
 in
 some


way
 are
 in
 the
 US.
 And
 it
 strikes
 me
 as


that's
 the
 unusual
 situation
 which
 is
 we


don't
 typically
 associate
 volatile


sovereigns
 with
 being
 the
 home
 of
 the


most
 dynamic
 companies
 in
 the
 world.
 And


so
 to
 my
 mind
 I
 would
 love
 to
 have
 expo


more
 exposure
 to
 Nvidia
 and
 Microsoft


and
 all
 of
 these
 companies
 that
 are


making
 money
 handover
 fist
 without


having
 exposure
 to
 the
 US
 itself
 and


hence
 I
 might
 want
 to
 hedge.
 I
 mean


certainly
 you
 know
 the
 equity
 market


story
 I
 mean
 that
 really
 is
 in
 a
 class


of
 its
 own
 uh
 and
 as
 you
 say
 that's


really
 been
 a
 very
 very
 strong
 theme
 but


more
 broadly
 you
 know
 capital
 markets
 if


you
 think
 about
 how
 capital
 markets


operate
 um
 there's
 a
 whole
 ecosystem


behind
 that
 and
 uh
 you
 have
 the


underlying
 securities
 obviously
 but
 then


you
 have
 the
 hedging
 instruments
 and


then
 you
 have
 a
 whole
 set
 of
 investors


who
 are
 actually
 you
 know
 taking
 part


and
 um
 the
 banking
 system
 is
 absolutely


crucial
 in
 providing
 those
 hedging


services.
 And
 I
 think
 when
 we
 last


discussed
 this
 uh
 back
 in
 Jackson
 Hole,


you
 know,
 we
 talked
 about
 how
 the
 FX


swap
 market
 makes
 uh
 you
 know,
 money


fungeible
 across
 currencies.


>> Mh.


>> And
 you
 know,
 money
 is
 ultimately


something
 to
 do
 with
 banks.
 So,
 you


know,
 the
 central
 bank,
 you
 know,
 issues


highowered
 money.
 Commercial
 banks
 uh


are
 there
 also
 to
 issue
 money
 that
 the


other
 users
 will
 will
 take
 advantage
 of.


and
 FX
 swaps
 are
 there
 you
 know


basically
 providing
 this
 uh
 you
 know


service
 of
 making
 money
 fungeible
 across


currencies.
 So
 um
 you
 know
 every
 piece


fits
 into
 every
 other
 piece
 in
 that


sense
 and
 so
 you
 know
 we
 should
 think


about
 this
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 um
 the


mutually
 reinforcing
 pieces
 of
 this
 uh


you
 know
 this
 network.


What
 have
 you
 observed
 in
 in
 terms
 of


the
 actual
 trends
 in
 FX
 hedging
 costs?


Because
 as
 you
 described
 it
 in
 April,


suddenly
 it
 all
 starts
 kicking
 off.
 A


lot
 of
 large
 investors
 who
 are
 not
 that


used
 perhaps
 to
 having
 to
 hedge
 their


dollar
 exposure
 suddenly
 scrambled
 to
 do


it
 expost
 as
 you
 described.
 Did
 that


mean
 that
 the
 cost
 of
 actually
 doing
 so


actually
 increased
 or
 was
 it
 still


relatively
 cheap?
 Well,
 actually
 it's
 um


it's
 primarily
 about
 how
 high
 the


short-term
 interest
 rates
 are
 actually


and
 in
 particular
 if
 you're
 a
 non-
 US


investor
 investing
 in
 dollar
 assets,


it's
 really
 how
 high
 the
 short-term


dollar
 interest
 rate
 is.
 Because


essentially
 what
 we're
 doing
 is,
 you


know,
 you're
 pledging
 euros,
 let's
 say,


and
 then
 borrowing
 dollars
 short-term


and
 then
 investing
 in
 dollar
 assets.
 And


so
 it's
 really
 about
 um
 how
 high
 that


short-term
 interest
 rate
 is
 relative
 to


the
 yield
 you're
 getting
 on
 the
 uh
 on


the
 asset
 itself.
 And
 so
 if
 you
 have
 a


flat
 yield
 curve,
 you
 know,
 which
 is


what
 we've
 had
 or
 even
 inverted
 yield


curve,
 then
 hedging
 costs
 are
 very
 high.


And
 so
 in
 fact,
 you
 know,
 investors
 have


typically
 hedged
 and
 hedge
 ratios
 have


fluctuated.
 There's
 no
 systematic


survey,
 but
 it's
 fluctuated
 between
 40


and
 60%.
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 some
 pockets


of
 official
 data
 like
 the
 Japanese
 uh


life
 insurance
 companies
 but
 typically


this
 is
 you
 know
 really
 quite
 quite


anecdotal
 but
 what
 had
 happened
 um
 in


the
 last
 year
 or
 so
 was
 uh
 the
 hedge


ratios
 had
 gone
 down
 gradually.
 Some


firms
 were
 not
 even
 hedging
 at
 all.
 You


know
 they
 were
 trying
 to
 win
 both
 on
 the


stronger
 dollar
 but
 also
 on
 the
 high


yields.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.


>> Actually
 let
 me
 just
 me
 um
 mention
 a


very
 interesting
 point
 here
 actually.
 Um


it's
 actually
 uh
 worth
 thinking
 about


the
 parallels
 between
 this
 story
 about


you
 know
 advanced
 economy
 investors


holding
 US
 dollar
 assets
 with
 the
 story


about
 local
 currency
 emerging
 market


bonds.
 Uh
 you
 know
 that's
 actually
 a


very
 very
 you
 know
 important
 asset
 class


that
 really
 grew
 up
 after
 the
 GFC


>> and
 that's
 typical
 asset
 class
 where
 the


investor
 would
 not
 hedge.
 So
 if
 you
 want


to
 enter
 into
 a
 large
 emerging
 market


sovereign
 bond
 uh
 trade,
 you
 would


actually
 buy
 the
 instrument
 on
 an


unhedged
 basis.
 And
 you
 do
 that
 because


uh
 you
 know
 you
 think
 um
 the
 emerging


market
 currency
 will
 appreciate


uh
 as
 well
 as
 the
 yield
 fall.
 And
 so
 you


win
 twice.
 You
 know
 you
 gain
 both
 on
 the


yield
 uh
 you
 know
 as
 well
 as
 on
 the


exchange
 rate.
 But
 of
 course
 when
 the


tide
 turns
 that's
 when
 you
 you
 know


scramble
 to
 you
 know
 hedge
 expost
 and


that's
 exactly
 you
 know
 the
 same
 type
 of


thing
 that
 we
 saw
 you
 know
 in
 this
 uh
 in


this
 episode
 and
 you
 and
 there
 were


actually
 uh
 emerging
 market
 investors


especially
 from
 Asia
 who
 were
 you
 know


caught
 with
 very
 low
 hedge
 ratios
 and


there
 was
 this
 expost
 hedging
 going
 on.


So
 there's
 actually
 a
 very
 interesting


parallel
 between
 uh
 you
 know
 what
 was


you
 know
 going
 on
 this
 April
 and
 the


much
 older
 trade
 which
 is
 the
 emerging


market
 trade.


>> So
 Joe
 on
 the
 plus
 side
 people
 aren't


necessarily
 selling
 dollar
 assets.
 On


the
 downside,
 the
 negative
 side,
 we're


basically
 treating
 dollar
 assets
 the
 way


we
 would
 a
 local
 emerging
 market
 bond.


>> People
 are
 like,
 I
 think
 I'm
 gonna
 buy


some
 local
 currency
 US
 debt.


>> That's
 right.


Um
 actually
 but
 like
 so
 what
 was
 it


about
 April
 then
 that
 caused
 the
 like


what
 I
 mean
 we
 know
 there
 was
 yeah
 they


launched
 a
 trade
 war
 and
 there
 were
 like


massive
 tariffs
 etc
 but
 like
 what
 was
 it


about
 that
 such
 that
 people's
 uh


impulses
 to
 hedge
 more
 expose
 factor
 as


you've
 described
 it
 what
 was
 the
 thing


that
 said
 oh
 we
 want
 to
 uh
 change
 our
 uh


the
 our
 sort
 of
 our
 exposure
 to
 dollars


even
 if
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 sell
 them


>> I
 think
 it's
 uh
 probably
 a
 combination


of
 several
 things
 but
 uh
 where
 the
 you


know
 where
 the
 investors
 found


themselves
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 hedge
 ratios


had
 a
 lot
 to
 do
 with
 this.
 Um
 actually


if
 you
 look
 through
 your
 you
 know


Bloomberg
 uh
 news
 database
 you'll
 find


plenty
 of
 stories
 from
 23
 24
 where
 uh


let's
 say
 life
 insurance
 companies
 uh


announce
 that
 they
 will
 not
 be
 hedging


uh
 you
 know
 there
 so
 you
 know
 they
 would


be
 holding
 uh
 let's
 say
 US
 dollar
 assets


but
 without
 a
 hedge
 and
 as
 I
 said
 you


know
 there
 were
 some
 firms
 that
 didn't


hedge
 at
 all
 and
 in
 a
 riskoff


environment
 what
 typically
 happens
 that


you
 want
 to
 take
 some
 chips
 off
 the


table.
 Uh
 and
 that
 just
 means
 reducing


your
 exposure.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 if
 you're
 exposed,
 you
 know,
 in
 this


double
 whammy
 fashion,
 uh
 you
 know,
 uh


you
 would
 actually
 try
 and
 um
 you
 know,


either
 hedge
 expost
 or
 reduce
 your


exposure.
 It
 looks
 like,
 uh
 from
 the


evidence
 that
 it
 was
 very
 much
 the


expost
 hedging
 story.
 So
 if
 people
 are


hedging
 their
 dollar
 exposure
 more
 than


perhaps
 some
 of
 them
 at
 least
 used
 to,


do
 we
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 things
 like


rollover
 risk
 or
 some
 sort
 of
 I
 guess


duration
 mismatched
 where
 you
 have
 a


shortterm
 um
 hedge
 whether
 it's
 a


forward
 or
 a
 swap
 or
 whatever
 mismatched


to
 a
 longer
 term
 asset.
 I
 mean
 this
 is


this
 is
 what
 the
 BIS
 does
 on
 a


day-to-day
 basis
 is
 worry
 about


potential
 risks.
 So,
 are
 you
 worried


here?


>> That's
 a
 really
 great
 comment,
 Tracy.


And,
 uh,
 um,
 I
 think
 this
 was,
 uh,
 you


know,
 where
 I
 was
 going
 to
 go
 next.
 Um,


of
 course,
 you
 have
 this,
 you
 know,
 once


you
 hedge,
 you've
 hedged
 the
 currency


risk
 at least
 until
 the
 maturity
 of
 the


swap,
 which
 is
 typically,
 you
 know,
 1


month
 to
 3
 months.
 But,
 uh,
 it's
 a


short-term,
 it's
 a
 short-term
 liability


that
 you
 need
 to
 roll
 over.


And
 from
 time
 to
 time
 you
 might
 get


caught
 in
 a
 in
 a
 liquidity
 uh
 you
 know


stress
 episode
 where
 it's
 difficult
 to


source
 the
 dollars
 to
 actually
 repay
 and


this
 was
 for
 example
 what
 happened


during
 the
 GFC.
 It's
 also
 what
 happened


during
 March
 2020
 uh
 when
 there
 was
 also


a
 scramble
 for
 dollars
 and
 uh
 you
 know


when
 you're
 a
 long-term
 investor
 you've


hedged
 using
 uh
 a
 short-term
 FX
 swap
 but


you're
 holding
 you
 know
 long-term


securities
 you
 have
 a
 maturity
 mismatch


so
 either
 you
 have
 to
 somehow
 you
 know


sell
 your
 long-term
 assets
 which
 is


going
 to
 be
 very
 difficult
 at
 a
 fair


price
 or
 you
 have
 to
 join
 the
 scramble


for
 dollars
 uh
 with
 all
 all
 the
 other


borrowers
 of
 dollars
 in
 the
 market.
 And


so
 this
 is
 the
 paradox
 where
 you
 know


you're
 a
 long-term
 investor
 but
 actually


you
 have
 this
 short-term
 uh
 you
 know


dollar
 obligation.
 And
 so
 you
 know
 we
 we


are
 swapping
 one
 uh
 well
 we
 are
 actually


you
 know
 exchanging
 one
 type
 of
 risk
 for


another.
 We're
 actually
 changing


currency
 mismatch
 for
 maturity
 mismatch.


And
 um
 uh
 you
 know
 empirically
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 evidence
 over
 the
 years
 it's


when
 the
 dollar
 is
 falling
 for
 a
 long


period
 of
 time
 that
 these
 hedge
 ratios


become
 very
 very
 high.
 So
 you
 know
 good


example
 is
 the
 period
 before
 the
 GFC


when
 uh
 you
 know
 dollar
 was
 uh
 you
 know


really
 falling
 uh
 you
 know
 quite


considerably.
 Yeah.


>> But
 then
 what
 happened
 at
 the
 GFC
 was
 of


course
 you
 know
 dollar
 really
 spiked


>> right


>> because
 there
 was
 a
 scramble
 for


dollars.
 So
 you
 there's
 always
 this


trade-off.
 you
 either
 have
 to
 bear
 some


currency
 risk
 or
 you
 bear
 this
 maturity


risk
 and
 then
 the
 you
 know
 bear
 this


maturity
 mismatch
 risk
 I
 should
 say
 and


and
 so
 we
 you
 know
 it's
 really
 uh
 you


know
 um
 changing
 one
 type
 of
 risk
 for


[Music]


Tracy
 really
 loves
 currency
 markets


because
 she
 loves
 the
 fact
 that
 when
 the


line
 moves
 it's
 you
 can
 never
 tell


whether
 it's
 the
 numerator
 or


denominator
 that's
 at
 fault.
 But


>> this
 is
 sarcasm
 by
 the
 way
 for
 those
 who


don't
 know.
 I
 hate
 currency
 markets.


>> She
 hates
 currency
 markets
 because
 you


never
 know
 whether
 we
 should
 be
 it's
 the


numerator
 den.


>> You
 say
 the
 dollar
 is
 going
 down.


Someone's
 going
 to
 be
 like,
 "Oh,
 no,
 but


it's
 up
 against
 like
 some
 obscure


currency
 that
 no
 one's
 ever
 heard
 of."


>> But
 but
 em
 and
 you
 mentioned
 um
 em
 and


uh
 em
 bond
 funds,
 em
 indices
 and


currency
 is
 doing
 very
 well.
 And
 so
 this


gets
 to
 the
 question
 of
 like
 is
 this
 a


numerator
 story?
 Is
 it
 about
 dollar


weakening
 or
 is
 it
 about
 uh
 so
 we've


been
 talking
 a
 lot
 about
 financial


flows.
 Has
 something
 changed
 though
 in


the
 sort
 of
 underlying
 economic


fundamentals
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 EM?
 I've
 heard


some
 rumblings
 about
 this.
 People


excited
 about
 EM
 in
 a
 way
 that
 I
 don't


think
 they
 were
 excited
 about
 to
 the


same
 degree
 during
 the
 2010s
 at
 all.
 And


I
 just
 while
 we
 were
 chatting,
 I
 pulled


up
 a
 bunch
 of
 lines
 of
 EM
 related
 funds,


currencies
 all
 doing
 very
 well.
 In
 your


research,
 are
 there
 fundamental
 changes


in
 the
 EM
 world
 that
 are
 like
 people
 are


excited
 about
 for
 reasons
 other
 than
 the


fact
 that
 the
 uh
 dollar
 is
 weak?


>> So,
 this
 is
 very
 timely,
 Joe.
 Uh
 and
 as


it
 happens
 on
 Monday,
 we
 published
 a


bulletin
 exactly
 on
 this
 question.
 Um


you
 are
 the
 emerging
 markets
 doing
 well


uh
 because
 of
 better
 policy,
 better


fundamentals
 or
 is
 it
 really
 about
 the


the
 global
 financial
 market
 trends?
 And


the
 short
 answer
 is
 it's
 a
 bit
 of
 both.


Tracy
 loves
 this


>> and
 you
 would
 uh
 and
 you
 would
 uh
 you


know
 not
 think
 of
 otherwise.


>> Um
 why
 is
 it
 better
 fundamentals?
 Well,


I
 think
 it's
 uh
 uh
 certainly
 uh
 there's


been
 much
 better
 policy
 uh
 especially
 uh


monetary
 policy


and
 also
 the
 emerging
 markets
 have
 uh


have
 really
 been
 boyed
 by
 actually
 you


know
 uh
 the
 weaker
 dollar.
 The
 weaker


dollar
 has
 been
 a
 tailwind
 um
 for
 much


of
 the
 year.


>> This
 is
 why
 uh
 emerging
 market
 assets


have
 really
 you
 know
 rallied
 quite
 hard


and
 there's
 there's
 a
 parallel
 with


credit
 spreads
 as
 well
 because
 you
 know


when
 credit
 is
 doing
 well
 uh
 we
 also


tend
 to
 see
 emerging
 market
 assets
 also


doing
 well.
 Um
 and
 if
 we
 break
 it
 down


so
 why
 would
 uh
 uh
 a
 weakening
 dollar
 be


a
 tailwind
 for
 emerging
 markets?
 Well,


you
 know,
 in
 the
 simplest
 possible
 case,


if
 a
 borrower
 has
 borrowed
 dollars
 but


then
 uh
 has
 invested
 in
 local
 currency


assets,
 you
 know,
 there's
 this
 currency


mismatch,
 but
 then
 there's
 a
 windfall


when
 the
 when
 the
 dollar
 weakens.
 That's


a
 very
 simple
 story.
 It's
 probably
 not


the
 most
 important.
 But
 there's
 another


very
 interesting
 element
 here
 which
 has


to
 do
 with
 the
 so-called
 risk-taking


channel.
 And
 the
 idea
 here
 is
 if
 you


have
 a
 very
 diversified,
 you
 know,


portfolio
 of
 these
 um
 of
 the
 loans
 to


all
 of
 these,
 you
 know,
 currency


mismatch
 borrowers,
 the
 improved
 credit


risk
 on
 these
 borrowers
 really,
 you


know,
 shrinks
 the
 tail
 risk
 in
 the


credit
 for
 the,
 you
 know,
 for
 the


lender.


>> Uh
 so,
 if
 you
 like,
 the
 value
 at
 risk


goes
 down
 and
 that
 really
 opens
 the
 door


to
 to
 more
 credit.
 So
 there's
 this
 very


very
 strong
 relationship
 between
 a


weaker
 dollar
 and
 faster
 growth
 of


dollar
 denominated
 credit
 and


because
 of
 how
 important
 dollar
 credit


is
 for
 supply
 chains
 if
 there's
 any
 uh


product
 if
 there's
 any
 good
 that
 out


there
 that
 relies
 on
 very
 complex
 supply


chains
 global
 value
 chains


those
 uh
 products
 will
 tend
 to
 do
 very


well
 and
 what
 you've
 seen
 is
 actually
 in


spite
 of
 the
 weaker
 dollar
 exports
 have


gone
 up
 in
 these
 very
 highly


sophisticated
 goods
 and
 much
 more
 so


than
 the
 goods
 that
 are
 much
 more


affected
 by
 just
 a
 simple
 the
 simple


trade
 effect
 and
 the
 exchange
 rate.
 So


semiconductors
 for example,
 I
 mean
 this


has
 been
 one
 of
 the
 surprises.


>> Clearly
 there's
 the
 AI
 boom,
 but
 it's


not
 just
 that.
 If
 you
 look
 at


semiconductor
 trade
 exports
 from
 Asia,


that's
 really
 been
 very
 very
 resilient


this
 year.
 And
 um
 anything
 that
 has
 to


do
 with
 global
 supply
 chains,
 you
 would


also
 see.
 But
 there's
 a,
 you
 know,


there's
 a
 sting
 in
 the
 tail
 here


because,
 as
 we
 talked
 about
 earlier,


emerging
 markets
 increasingly
 are


becoming
 net
 creditors
 to
 the
 rest
 of


the
 world.
 And
 there
 was
 very
 little


hedging
 going
 on.
 And
 so
 when
 you're


caught
 in
 one
 of
 these
 downdrafts,
 you


get
 hit
 both
 from,
 you
 know,
 the
 weaker


dollar
 and
 also
 the
 and
 also
 the
 high


yields.
 And
 so
 we
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 uh,


you
 know,
 scrambling
 uh,
 you
 know,
 back


in
 April.
 So
 it's
 primarily
 a
 tailwind


and
 it
 has
 been
 a
 tailwind
 uh
 for
 a
 long


time
 but
 there
 is
 this
 third
 element


this
 new
 element
 which
 I
 think
 we
 need


to
 keep
 an
 eye
 on.


>> What
 do
 you
 see
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the


price
 of
 gold?
 So
 we
 are
 recording
 this


on
 October
 17th.
 It's
 coming
 down
 a
 tiny


bit
 this
 morning
 but
 still
 above
 $4,000


an
 ounce.
 What
 is
 that
 telling
 you
 about


how
 investors
 are
 feeling
 about
 various


global
 currencies
 at
 the
 moment?


Well,
 Tracy,
 uh,
 I
 mean,
 we
 we
 hear
 a


lot
 about
 the
 so-called
 debasement


trade.
 Um,
 but
 I
 think
 that's
 probably


overdoing
 things.
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 a


debasement
 is
 really
 about
 the
 value
 of


money
 relative
 to,
 you
 know,
 goods
 and


services.
 We
 don't
 really
 see
 a
 surge
 in


inflation.
 Um,
 we
 don't
 see
 a
 surge
 in


the
 price
 of,


>> you
 know,
 even
 commodities.
 I
 mean,
 look


at,
 uh,
 you
 know,
 look
 at
 oil,
 look
 at


other
 commodity,
 you
 know,
 uh,


everything
 other
 than
 gold.
 And
 I
 so
 I


think
 we
 should
 probably
 look
 for
 a
 more


tailored
 explanation
 for
 gold
 other
 than


simply
 you
 know
 this
 broader
 uh
 sort
 of


sense
 of
 um
 you
 know
 uh
 you
 know
 flight


from
 you
 know
 fiat
 currencies
 and
 uh
 you


know
 I
 think
 one
 thing
 which
 goes
 back


to
 our
 initial
 conversation
 on
 uh
 the


role
 of
 the
 dollar
 and
 the
 global


financial
 system
 certainly
 central
 banks


have
 been
 big
 buyers
 of
 gold
 and
 there


has
 been
 you
 know
 that
 sort
 of
 you
 know


set
 a
 very
 sort
 of
 firm
 you
 know


backdrop
 to
 uh
 you
 to
 the
 market
 and


other
 people
 have
 jumped
 on
 the


bandwagon.


>> In
 a
 way,
 it's
 actually
 behaving
 like
 a


risk
 asset.
 Uh
 and
 the
 events
 uh
 and
 the


events
 today
 and
 you
 know
 last
 week
 as


well


>> uh
 rather
 than
 there
 being
 a
 flight
 uh


to
 gold
 during
 stress
 times
 what
 we're


seeing
 is
 it's
 behaving
 a
 bit
 like


Bitcoin
 um
 and
 uh
 and
 the
 risk
 assets.


So
 it
 sort
 of
 tells
 you
 that
 there's


been
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 speculative


element
 uh
 you
 know
 here
 but
 it's


certainly
 behaving
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 very


different
 from
 the
 from
 the
 historical


norms.


>> You
 know
 for
 a
 long
 time
 Traces
 talked


about
 this
 for
 a
 long
 time
 you
 could


sort
 of
 model
 the
 price
 of
 gold
 via
 real


rates
 and
 when
 they
 were
 very
 low
 or


suppressed
 or
 whatever
 gold
 went
 up.
 It


kind
 of
 seemed
 like
 it
 changed
 not
 long


after
 Putin
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 his
 money


seized.
 Like
 is
 and
 when
 you
 talk
 about


central
 banks
 accumulating
 gold
 being


woken
 up
 to
 the
 fact
 that
 your
 money
 is


never
 really
 your
 money
 if
 it's
 in
 a


bank
 that
 seems
 like
 it
 could
 be
 part
 of


it.


>> Well,
 Joe,
 I
 mean
 uh
 certainly
 there
 are


very
 few
 assets
 which
 are
 not
 the


liabilities
 of
 someone
 of
 someone.
 And


uh
 you
 know
 typically
 whether
 it's
 a


fixed
 income
 instrument
 or
 an
 equity,


it's
 someone's
 liability.
 So
 someone
 has


the
 obligation
 to
 pay
 you
 and
 gold
 is


one
 of
 those
 which
 is
 not
 the
 liability


of
 of of
 of
 any
 particular
 individual.


Now
 I
 think
 um
 you
 know
 when
 we
 look


back
 we
 can
 see
 these
 sort
 of
 broad
 you


know
 swings
 in
 the
 price
 of
 gold
 after


the
 breakdown
 of
 Bretonwoods
 in
 the


early
 '7s
 you
 know
 there
 was
 a
 brief


spike
 but
 then
 we
 had
 a
 very
 very
 long


period
 when
 you
 know
 gold
 wasn't
 doing


very
 much.
 Um
 I
 think
 it
 um
 it's


probably
 something
 even
 before
 the


Russian
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 Joe.
 Um
 so


you
 know
 we've
 seen
 the
 trend
 where


something
 uh
 you
 know
 uh
 like
 this
 has


also
 sort
 of
 happened
 actually
 a
 few


years
 back
 even
 uh
 you
 know
 even
 before


the
 Russian
 invasion
 of
 uh
 Ukraine
 in
 22


but
 I
 think
 it's
 um
 you
 know
 this
 this


element
 this
 uh
 this
 attribute
 where


it's
 not
 the
 liability
 of
 any
 particular


uh
 you
 know


>> uh
 legal
 entity
 or
 individual
 I
 think


you
 know
 is
 giving
 this
 a
 particular


Yeah.


So,
 I'm
 looking
 at
 the
 the
 top
 menu
 on


Bloomberg
 right
 now,
 and
 you
 know,
 it


it's
 feeling
 a
 little
 bit
 nervy
 at
 the


moment.
 So,
 the
 number
 one
 story
 is


banks
 trio
 of
 alleged
 fraud
 sparks
 fear


of
 broader
 issues.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 idea


that
 this
 is
 Jamie
 Diamond's
 cockroach


idea
 that
 we're
 starting
 to
 see
 some


losses
 emerge
 from
 either
 outright


frauds
 or
 just
 bad
 investments
 and


people
 are
 starting
 to
 get
 a
 little
 bit


nervous.
 Do
 you
 see
 any
 sorts
 of
 I
 guess


credit
 oriented
 concerns
 out
 there
 at


the
 moment?


>> Well,
 Tracy,
 I
 mean
 certainly
 this
 week


is
 a
 very
 uh
 newsrich
 environment.
 Um


one
 way
 you
 are
 we
 love
 it.
 We
 love
 you


are
 you
 know
 contributing
 to
 that
 and
 I


think
 it's
 great.
 Um
 you
 know
 we
 we
 we


hear
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 comments


uh
 you
 know
 on
 credit
 certainly
 credit


uh
 standards
 have
 been
 eroding
 for
 a


long
 time
 and
 we
 have
 been
 one
 of
 the


many
 voices
 uh
 you
 know
 even
 before
 this


week
 uh
 you
 know
 just
 pointing
 out
 that


credit
 spreads
 have
 fallen
 to
 historical


lows.
 Um


but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 the
 trajectory
 of


uh
 credit
 to
 the
 private
 sector
 and


compare
 that
 to
 what's
 been
 happening
 to


government
 debt
 uh
 there
 there
 really


isn't
 um
 a
 comparison.
 So
 it's
 certainly


before
 the
 GFC
 uh
 the
 big
 growth
 was
 in


the
 credit
 of
 the
 private
 sector


especially
 in
 the
 form
 of
 mortgages


but
 after
 that
 what
 we've
 seen
 is
 credit


to
 the
 private
 sector
 has
 really
 uh
 been


very
 subdued
 um
 and
 instead
 it's
 really


been
 the
 government
 uh
 uh
 you
 know
 bond


market
 which
 has
 grown
 tremendously.
 Now


what
 we're
 seeing
 now
 is
 uh
 you
 know


some
 signs
 of
 the
 erosion
 of
 credit


standards
 you
 know
 coming
 back
 to
 bite.


But
 if
 you're
 worried
 about
 something


very
 systemic,
 if
 you're,
 you
 know,


worried
 about
 systemic
 risk,
 uh
 the


first
 thing
 to
 ask
 is
 how
 fast
 has
 this


grown
 in
 the
 recent
 past.
 And
 typically


something
 that's
 grown
 very
 rapidly


will,
 you
 know,
 give
 you
 some
 cause
 for


concern.


In
 this
 case,
 um
 the
 really
 rapidly


growing
 element
 has
 not
 been
 credit
 to


the
 private
 sector.
 It's
 been
 credit
 to


the
 government
 and
 in
 particular
 the
 the


government
 bond
 market.
 So
 we
 should


have
 you
 know
 we
 should
 of
 course
 worry


about
 uh
 um
 you
 know
 these
 uh
 you
 know


these
 events
 and
 of
 course
 the
 headlines


you
 know
 create
 uh
 you
 know
 it's
 as
 I


said
 it's
 a
 very
 news-rich
 environment


uh
 we
 hear
 that
 and
 we
 hear
 the
 same


stories
 in
 the
 panels
 if
 it's
 really
 a


concern
 about
 you
 know
 uh
 is
 this
 the


precursor
 to
 the
 next
 uh
 you
 know


systemic
 crisis
 it's
 probably
 not
 the


case


>> actually
 this
 uh
 brings
 to
 mind


something
 that
 I
 don't
 think
 I've
 really


asked
 in
 such
 a
 way
 before.
 But
 another


thing
 that's
 grown
 a
 lot
 is
 the
 stock


market
 or
 equity
 equity
 markets.
 There


was
 actually
 a
 really
 good
 article
 in


the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal
 several
 days
 ago


about
 the
 degree
 to
 which
 equity


exposure
 at least
 in
 the
 US
 has
 spread


demographically.
 So
 a
 lot
 many
 more
 like


working-class
 households
 own
 stocks
 than


they
 used
 to.
 When
 I
 think
 about
 people


who
 are
 in
 the
 business
 of
 being
 worried


about
 financial
 stability,


they
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 they
 stocks
 are


high
 on
 their
 radar.
 They're
 called


risky
 assets.
 We
 all
 know
 they're
 risky.


And
 usually
 crises
 don't
 emerge
 from


assets
 that
 we
 all
 agree
 are
 risky.
 That


crises
 emerge
 from
 assets
 that
 we
 think


are
 going
 to
 be
 redeemed
 from
 a
 dollar's


worth.
 We're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 dollars
 back


or
 whatever
 or
 we're
 worried
 about


getting
 back
 at
 all.
 But
 I'm
 curious


from
 the
 perspective
 of
 someone
 who


professionally
 maybe
 worries,
 how
 do
 you


and
 your
 colleagues
 think
 about
 equity


exposure,
 especially
 given
 the


widespread
 view
 that
 equity
 exposure
 is


fueling
 consumption
 in
 the
 United


States,
 a
 driver
 of
 the
 economy,
 that


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 speculative
 exit.
 Like


is
 there
 much
 modeling
 work
 being
 done


on
 equity
 and
 risky
 assets
 specifically


as
 a
 source
 of
 broader
 risk?


>> Absolutely.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the
 you
 know


the
 main
 channel
 would
 be
 through
 the


real
 economy.


>> Yeah.


>> Through
 through
 real
 economic
 activity


rather
 than
 through
 let's
 say
 a


deleveraging
 episode
 or
 a
 liquidity


episode.


>> I
 think
 it's
 worth
 thinking
 back
 to
 the


dotcom
 bubble
 uh
 of
 2000.
 You
 know
 that


was
 a
 period
 of
 course
 when
 the


valuations
 were
 even
 more
 extreme


and
 when
 the
 stock
 market
 fell
 in
 2000.


Of
 course,
 we
 did
 see
 some
 effect.
 Um,


and
 of
 course,
 a
 lot
 of
 investors
 uh


lost
 money.
 Um,
 but
 there
 was
 nothing


like
 the
 same
 kind
 of
 impact
 on
 the
 real


economy
 that
 we
 had


>> with
 the
 GFC.
 And
 very
 simplistic
 way
 of


putting
 this
 is
 uh
 whenever
 you
 have


debt
 of
 various
 kinds,
 that's
 when
 you


should
 be
 worried
 because
 Joe,
 as
 you


said,
 it's
 when
 you're
 promised
 one
 $


one,
 but
 then
 you
 don't
 deliver.
 um


that's
 when
 you
 know
 there
 are
 sort
 of


you
 repercussions
 throughout
 the


economy.
 Now
 clearly
 with
 the
 equity


markets
 there
 are
 wealth
 effects.
 So
 you


know
 if
 you
 have
 a
 very
 large
 portfolio


you
 feel
 richer
 and
 then
 you
 spend
 more


and
 so
 there
 is
 a
 real
 economy
 effect
 of


um
 of
 the
 stock
 market.
 So
 if
 they
 if
 we


see
 a
 pullback
 in
 the
 stock
 market
 very


sustained
 pullback
 we
 will
 see
 you
 know


some
 effect
 like
 that.
 Now
 the
 estimates


of
 the
 wealth
 effect
 on
 consumption
 for


example
 has
 varied
 over
 the
 um
 over
 the


years
 but
 uh
 given
 the
 if
 you
 like
 the


democratization
 of
 stocks
 we
 could
 we


could
 expect
 a
 slightly
 larger


magnitudes
 but
 on
 the
 scale
 of
 things


that
 effect
 tends
 to
 be
 very
 small


compared
 to
 the
 kinds
 of
 effects


>> that
 are
 associated
 with
 deleveraging


episodes.


>> Do
 you
 see
 any
 pockets
 of
 leverage
 out


there
 that
 aren't
 getting
 enough


attention
 at
 the
 moment?
 Well,
 I
 think


you're
 very
 good
 at
 uh
 shining
 a
 light


on
 those,
 you
 know,
 all
 those
 pockets


actually.
 So,
 I
 think
 probably
 I
 don't


think
 I
 can
 really
 say
 anything
 here


that
 you
 haven't
 heard
 of.
 Okay.


>> Uh
 but
 I
 think
 it's
 certainly
 worth
 uh


bearing
 in
 mind
 the
 broad
 magnitude.


Yeah.
 One
 of the
 things
 that
 we've
 um
 uh


you
 know,
 we've
 talked
 about
 a
 lot
 this


year
 in
 our
 various
 uh
 official


publications
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 even
 you


know
 safe
 assets
 can
 be
 a
 source
 of


stress
 in
 the
 market
 because
 it's
 not


default
 that
 uh
 you
 know
 propagate


stress.
 It's
 more
 the
 deleveraging
 and
 I


think
 um
 you
 know
 if
 let's
 say
 long


rates
 were
 to
 you
 know
 shoot
 up
 and


therefore
 mortgage
 rates
 uh
 also
 shoot


up
 you
 know
 that
 would
 be
 a
 really
 big


deal
 for
 the
 real
 economy
 and
 that
 would


happen
 even
 without
 any
 defaults.


>> By
 the
 way
 when
 we
 started
 this


conversation
 the
 tenure
 was
 below
 4%.


It's
 above
 it
 now.


>> So
 just
 keeping
 our
 listeners
 up
 to
 date


on
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 the
 Treasury


market
 on
 October
 17th
 2025.


>> Very
 good.
 I
 mean,
 the
 other
 interesting


thing
 is
 if
 gold
 is
 acting
 like
 a


speculative
 asset
 now,
 what
 happens
 when


all
 of
 that
 starts
 reversing
 and
 you


know,
 the
 thing
 that
 you
 thought
 was


worth
 $4,000
 is
 no
 longer
 worth
 $4,000


and
 gold
 is
 typically
 used
 as


collateral,
 right?


>> Well,
 I
 always
 say,
 you
 know,
 it's


really
 scary
 when
 you
 see
 people
 like


intensely
 buying
 gold
 because
 like


what's
 up?
 Like
 what?
 But
 what's
 really


scary
 is
 why
 they
 start
 selling
 gold,


right?
 Because
 again,
 it's
 true,
 right?


Because
 actually
 no
 one
 has


>> You
 have
 to
 be
 a
 real
 psycho
 to
 have
 a


gold
 denominated
 mortgage.
 you
 have


dollar
 denominated
 mortgages
 etc.
 And
 so


when
 you
 see
 like
 usually
 I
 one
 of
 those


things
 you
 notice
 is
 that
 in
 a
 real


credit
 event
 when
 you
 really
 get
 that


VIX
 spike
 and
 people
 are
 really
 worried


about
 making
 that
 payment
 on
 their


mortgage
 and
 they're
 really
 worried


about
 paying
 their
 monthly
 subscription


to
 their
 Bloomberg
 terminal.
 They
 need


dollars
 and
 then
 they
 sell
 gold
 and


you're
 like
 oh
 things
 are
 getting
 really


rough.


>> All right,


>> I'm
 just
 throwing
 things
 out
 here.
 I


don't


>> I
 think
 that
 was
 a
 comment
 rather
 than
 a


question.


>> It
 was
 a
 comment
 not
 even
 a
 question.


Thank
 you,
 Joe,
 for
 your
 comment.
 Uh,


Hun,
 it's
 always
 lovely
 catching
 up.
 Uh,


this
 has
 been
 fantastic.
 Thank
 you
 so


much
 for
 coming
 back
 on
 the
 show.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much,
 Tracy.
 And
 thank


you,
 Joe.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 That
 was
 awesome.


[Music]


>> Joe,
 I
 always
 enjoy
 catching
 up
 with


him.
 He
 has
 a
 fantastic
 way
 of


explaining
 things
 in
 a
 very
 soothing


calming
 manner.
 I
 do
 think
 so.
 I
 nuance


is
 important.
 Absolutely.
 And


technicalities
 in
 the
 market
 are


important.
 So
 if
 the
 dollar
 going
 down


is
 being
 exacerbated
 by
 hedging
 versus


people
 selling
 dollars
 outright,
 that
 is


an
 important
 thing
 to
 talk
 about
 and
 to


capture.


>> However,


>> I
 still
 feel
 like
 the
 direction
 of


travel
 is
 not
 fantastic
 for
 the
 dollar


itself.
 If
 people
 are
 treating
 dollar


assets
 the
 way
 they
 used
 to
 treat
 local


EM
 bonds
 in
 terms
 of
 hedging
 that


exposure.


>> Yeah.


>> That
 doesn't
 seem
 great
 necessarily
 for


the
 US.
 I
 mean,


>> no,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 it's
 sort,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 of
 a
 currency
 as
 sort
 of
 like


being
 the
 token
 at
 Chuck-e-Cheese,
 you


know?


>> And
 you
 want
 to
 play
 the
 games,
 but
 it


was
 really
 nice
 if
 like
 the
 token
 is


going
 up
 and
 you
 can
 play
 the
 games
 at


the
 same
 time.


>> Play
 more
 games
 or
 eat
 more
 pizza


>> or
 or
 eat
 more
 pizza.
 But
 I
 think
 we're


in
 this
 situation
 where
 people
 want
 to


keep
 playing
 the
 games.
 They
 just
 don't


really
 like
 the
 whole
 arcade.


>> And
 uh
 yeah,
 this
 is
 this
 is
 the
 way
 I


think
 about
 it.
 The
 games
 are
 still
 fun.


>> It's
 just
 that
 you're
 worried
 about
 the


direction
 of
 the
 arcade.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 so
 I
 think
 cuz


and
 this
 is
 why
 you
 know
 like
 how
 are


you
 get
 what
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 like
 do


business
 in
 the
 United
 States?
 Give
 me
 a


break.
 That's
 completely
 unrealistic.


even
 if
 you
 don't
 like,
 as
 you
 put
 it,


the
 direction
 of
 travel.
 And
 so
 I
 think


sort
 of
 intuitively
 you
 could
 sort
 of


understand
 why
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 leave


town.
 I
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 arcade


exposure.


>> Absolutely.
 Um
 I
 guess
 what
 we
 kind
 of


need,
 we
 need
 another
 big
 crisis
 so
 that


we
 can
 observe
 what
 gold
 does
 during


that
 time
 and
 also
 what
 the
 dollar
 does


during
 that
 time.
 I
 think
 I'm
 gonna
 run


with
 this
 arc.
 Actually,
 I'm
 gonna
 run


with
 a
 really
 good
 analogy
 because
 like


like
 if
 you
 think
 like
 or
 you
 know


Chuck-E-Cheese
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 games,


but
 also
 I
 don't
 really
 think
 the


business
 model
 of
 Chuck-E-Cheese
 is
 like


that
 good.
 Like


>> how
 dare
 you?


>> Well,
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 have
 closed
 down,


but
 the
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 the
 games
 inside


were
 less
 fun.
 So,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 hold


those
 tokens
 in
 my
 pocket
 forever.
 I


want
 to
 have
 exposure
 in
 case
 they
 go


out
 they
 go
 out
 of
 business
 or
 something


like
 that.
 Doesn't
 make
 the
 games
 less


fun
 in
 the
 in
 the
 meantime.
 And
 you've


solved
 this
 problem
 of
 wanting
 to
 play


the
 games
 but
 being
 worried
 about
 the


future
 of
 Chuck-E-Cheese
 by
 hedging


them.


>> I'm
 gonna
 restart
 Chuck-e-Cheese
 and


roll
 it
 out
 across
 the
 country
 just
 to


ruin
 your
 analogy,
 your
 preferred
 market


analogy.
 No,
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 good
 one.
 It


makes
 sense.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.
 Finally.
 Thank


you.


>> All
 right.


>> But
 I
 will
 not
 be
 taking
 out


Chuck-e-Cheese
 denominated.
 Well,
 no.


So,
 that
 would
 be
 the
 great
 thing
 if
 you


could
 imagine
 getting
 a
 Chuck-e-Cheese


token
 denominated
 mortgage
 and
 then
 it


goes
 out
 of
 business.
 You
 don't
 even


have
 to
 pay
 him
 back.
 You
 know,
 I'm


pretty
 sure
 somewhere
 in
 like
 a
 box


somewhere
 I
 still
 have
 a
 bunch
 of
 like


Chuck-E-Cheese
 tickets
 or
 something
 like


that.


>> Maybe
 I
 should
 dig
 them
 out.


>> Anyway,


>> well,
 this
 is
 another
 interesting


question
 because
 what
 is
 the
 exchange


ratio
 between
 a
 token
 and
 a
 ticket,


right?
 And
 they're
 fundamentally


different
 than
 I
 don't
 know.
 This
 is


sort
 of
 like
 one
 of
 those
 communist


countries.
 Chuck-E-Cheese,
 this
 is
 a
 uh


paper
 that
 someone
 wrote.
 Chuck-e-Cheese


is
 the
 dual
 circulation
 economy
 in
 which


they
 have
 tokens
 for
 the
 games
 and


tickets
 for
 the
 prizes
 and
 how
 they


manage
 that
 exchange
 ratio
 is
 very


similar
 to
 a
 planned
 economy.


>> Do
 you
 think
 I
 could
 find
 someone
 to


provide
 like
 a
 swap
 on


>> Yeah.


>> a
 token
 versus
 a
 ticket
 or
 something?


>> I
 think
 there's
 something
 here.
 I
 think


we're
 I
 think
 we're
 hitting
 on
 something


important.


>> Okay.
 I
 think
 we
 should
 end
 We
 should


leave
 it
 there.


>> We
 can
 leave
 it
 there.


>> All
 right.
