[Speaker 0]:  then we need to talk about this big movie that just came out。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you two have seen it yet this exclusively in theatres on january。
[Speaker 0]:  third，
[Speaker 0]:  you should go see it。
[Speaker 0]:  this mania documentary eagle as a former trump supporter，
[Speaker 0]:  shouldn't you support the first ladies film？
[Speaker 0]:  are you saying youll support it？
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  i can take a look at it。
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  honestly，
[Speaker 0]:  are you going to spoil it today？
[Speaker 0]:  i don't have much to spoil。
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  i saw the trailer for this maior movie a long time ago，
[Speaker 0]:  but i always thought it was made by ye。
[Speaker 2]:  i couldn't believe it was a real movie，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  how could it be first of all millennia as the first lady is a very low key person，
[Speaker 2]:  people rarehear from her right？
[Speaker 2]:  this is completely different from trump，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  or obama's wife or clinton's wife，
[Speaker 2]:  she's a very locky person，
[Speaker 2]:  and she doesn't have much of a story detatell。
[Speaker 2]:  and trump is the current president。
[Speaker 2]:  it wouldn't be appropriate to make a film about his wife now，
[Speaker 2]:  would it？
[Speaker 2]:  it's like in china，
[Speaker 2]:  for example，
[Speaker 2]:  suddenly making a film about palm LUNPEMLUNN ssong zou in。
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  isn't that strange？
[Speaker 0]:  first of all，
[Speaker 0]:  it would definitely be critized by the whole world，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  that's why i always thought it was an AI made trailer，
[Speaker 0]:  because recently，
[Speaker 0]:  it's very popular to use AI to make movie trailers。
[Speaker 2]:  oh，
[Speaker 2]:  right，
[Speaker 2]:  then i thought it was made by eye later。
[Speaker 2]:  i found out it wasn't true more and more people were finding out on twitter that it was real。
[Speaker 0]:  really。
[Speaker 0]:  i'm quite curious than bit really came out。
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  and you know，
[Speaker 0]:  if this movie is about milelania's history，
[Speaker 0]:  how she met trump and how she had a romantic encounter with trump on an abston plane，
[Speaker 0]:  then i think i might buy a ticket to watch it。
[Speaker 0]:  i think it's a documentary that sounds a bit shadidy。
[Speaker 0]:  you're thinking is a bit perverted。
[Speaker 0]:  you just want to see some inappropriate content。
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  no，
[Speaker 0]:  the business is different。
[Speaker 0]:  i think it's important to clearly introduce the background of millona to everyone，
[Speaker 0]:  explaining how she as an immigrant gradually came to know the current US president。
[Speaker 0]:  it also involves abstein a figure who significantly influenced american politics，
[Speaker 0]:  casting a shadow over all american elites。
[Speaker 0]:  i think this film might be worth watching，
[Speaker 0]:  but this ronnia documentary is about meloniaous story of moving into the white house twenty days after trump one。
[Speaker 0]:  the election，
[Speaker 0]:  it's essentially her vlog。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you've ever watched vlogs on youtube。
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  it's about her moving。
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  well，
[Speaker 0]:  i've also been moving recently。
[Speaker 0]:  it's been a hassle for over twenty days。
[Speaker 0]:  you can also film one。
[Speaker 0]:  you can also film one。
[Speaker 0]:  i'll call it lulaugings twenty days of moving right relocation。
[Speaker 0]:  it's just that you don't have any power if you were like trump and became the US president，
[Speaker 0]:  i guess someone would definitely invest in you，
[Speaker 0]:  then loose e，
[Speaker 0]:  along would produce a documentary for you。
[Speaker 0]:  you can even turn your supermarket into a nationwide direct selling supermarket，
[Speaker 2]:  so i should have waited until after becoming president to move，
[Speaker 2]:  right。
[Speaker 2]:  if i remember correctly，
[Speaker 2]:  this film was produced by jeff bazos。
[Speaker 2]:  that's right。
[Speaker 2]:  that's why people gave it the name dc bribe movie this documentary film 还好。
[Speaker 2]:  do you know that jeff bazos MGM studio spent forty million dollars to acquire the rights to this film and promied to invest another thirty five million dollars in distribution totling seventy five million dollars。
[Speaker 2]:  what does this mean？
[Speaker 2]:  it means that before millonieous film even are in a single cent of the box office，
[Speaker 2]:  she could directly profit at least twenty eight million dollars from this deal。
[Speaker 2]:  hey，
[Speaker 2]:  luoufy is MGM the legendary metro golwin mayor。
[Speaker 2]:  the one with a big lion，
[Speaker 2]:  how was it acquired by amazon？
[Speaker 0]:  i'm really out of touch。
[Speaker 0]:  i'm so out of touch。
[Speaker 2]:  i just thought that big lion logo look pretty good，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  this is a this is not this。
[Speaker 0]:  i think you should know that baos SA lot lot of business dealings with the government，
[Speaker 0]:  including his blue origin and his amazon，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  the cloud service，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  yeah。
[Speaker 2]:  this is a small case。
[Speaker 2]:  i think the main purpose wasn't bribery。
[Speaker 2]:  do you think trump would even care about twenty million keys dealing in billions？
[Speaker 0]:  so the main purpose was flattery，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  just a flatter ter。
[Speaker 0]:  the first lady。
[Speaker 0]:  i think the main purpose was flattery flflattery。
[Speaker 0]:  well，
[Speaker 0]:  it's like that's saying again。
[Speaker 0]:  for example，
[Speaker 0]:  if you made a film called pung leu n in china，
[Speaker 0]:  i believe it wouldn't be for briving pung IUN，
[Speaker 0]:  but alonnia did actually receive a lot of money。
[Speaker 0]:  we have to admit that twenty eight million US dollars。
[Speaker 0]:  that's not a small sumb。
[Speaker 0]:  of course，
[Speaker 0]:  it's not a small sumb。
[Speaker 2]:  it's a huge number but prepared to trumps overall corruption。
[Speaker 2]:  this is just it's like when you were judging both elie at that time，
[Speaker 2]:  wasn't it said that he received the biggest bribe in france buying a villa for four million euros。
[Speaker 2]:  that's a huge number。
[Speaker 2]:  of course，
[Speaker 2]:  before a high ranking official，
[Speaker 2]:  you're insolving him。
[Speaker 2]:  i think it's the same with trump，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  if you say，
[Speaker 2]:  oh，
[Speaker 2]:  our first lady made this film just to get this twenty million，
[Speaker 2]:  then i think you're insulting her。
[Speaker 2]:  they receive money in the hundreds of millions of dollars，
[Speaker 2]:  for example，
[Speaker 2]:  you know that the competitor for this film disney only offered ourteen million dollars。
[Speaker 2]:  disney also wanted to flatter her，
[Speaker 2]:  but didn't succeed。
[Speaker 0]:  amazon offered three times that amount。
[Speaker 0]:  and the most amazing thing is that the director of this film is a retired director who came back to the industry，
[Speaker 0]:  the director，
[Speaker 0]:  who directed jackie chance movie rush hour。
[Speaker 0]:  he was involved in the me，
[Speaker 0]:  too，
[Speaker 0]:  movement suspected of sexually harassing hollywood actreresses and was forced to leave the film industry。
[Speaker 0]:  he successfufuly made a comeeback with this film。
[Speaker 0]:  well，
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  okay。
[Speaker 0]:  at the same time，
[Speaker 0]:  two thirds of the new york production team for this film requested that their names not be included in the film's credit。
[Speaker 0]:  wow，
[Speaker 0]:  that's heartbreaking，
[Speaker 0]:  truly heartbreaking。
[Speaker 2]:  this is so new。
[Speaker 2]:  i see some clueless。
[Speaker 2]:  media outlets are still compiling the box office figures。
[Speaker 2]:  oh，
[Speaker 2]:  yes，
[Speaker 2]:  i saw that they're saying that in LA，
[Speaker 2]:  there counting all the theatres in the most popular areas and apparently the most popular theater in la only sold two tickets in one night。
[Speaker 2]:  and then they said that the most popular theater in boston didn't sell a single ticket。
[Speaker 2]:  i watch the trailer a little bit。
[Speaker 2]:  the ve of log and ms。
[Speaker 2]:  english isn't even good。
[Speaker 2]:  what's the point of him making a movie or a documentary right，
[Speaker 2]:  if you're going to use english？
[Speaker 2]:  and you're not good at it，
[Speaker 2]:  you're just going to get deported right？
[Speaker 0]:  under normal circumstances。
[Speaker 0]:  he should have already been deported。
[Speaker 2]:  so we can't let him be deported。
[Speaker 2]:  we have to support him all buy a few tickets for the dallas area later。
[Speaker 2]:  i guess i can gather five viewers all buy five tickets。
[Speaker 2]:  and then i think this marketing team is so clueless，
[Speaker 2]:  you've invested so much money。
[Speaker 2]:  why are you being so stupid？
[Speaker 2]:  just give away some tickets，
[Speaker 2]:  wouldn't that make the box office look better making news like only selling two tickets in one night？
[Speaker 2]:  who are you trying to discuss really？
[Speaker 0]:  and the key thing is amazon announced another mass layoff ff these past two days，
[Speaker 0]:  lame off tens of thousands of people i saw that。
[Speaker 0]:  oh yes，
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  that's right。
[Speaker 0]:  this is already the how many rounds of layoffs。
[Speaker 0]:  it's countless thanks to watch collectors。
[Speaker 0]:  so you can see that these silicon valley big weeks are now trying to appeace trump。
[Speaker 0]:  these ceos are very good at playing politics。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you guys watch the video i made yesterday about how these ceos managed to thrive under the trumpera through。
[Speaker 0]:  so let's get into our topic for today。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you too have seen twitter。
[Speaker 0]:  it's gone crazy。
[Speaker 0]:  the epin ine filtotoled about three million documents。
[Speaker 2]:  oh，
[Speaker 2]:  dear。
[Speaker 2]:  well，
[Speaker 2]:  i briefly looked at this content，
[Speaker 2]:  and it's too disturbing。
[Speaker 2]:  i'm quite shocked。
[Speaker 0]:  you didn't believe it at first right。
[Speaker 0]:  at first，
[Speaker 0]:  you thought i made it up online，
[Speaker 0]:  but i actually check the FBI website，
[Speaker 0]:  not the FBI，
[Speaker 0]:  but the DOJ dog gov website，
[Speaker 0]:  and you can find the original text in the PDF document。
[Speaker 0]:  the most shocking part is that thirty five years ago，
[Speaker 0]:  in new jersey，
[Speaker 0]:  a thirteen year old girl performed oral sex on trump BJBBI。
[Speaker 0]:  you can google it if you don't understand。
[Speaker 0]:  and during a process，
[Speaker 0]:  she beid him，
[Speaker 0]:  and then when she laft ft trutrup hit her in the face after this document was made public，
[Speaker 0]:  the DOJ immediately deleadted the link，
[Speaker 0]:  but it had already been screen shoted and some people even recorded the screen。
[Speaker 0]:  it's very clear on the DOJ website that they lacks sufficient staff to publish so many documents。
[Speaker 0]:  and it's easy to make mistakes。
[Speaker 0]:  something like this was published，
[Speaker 0]:  and after it was published，
[Speaker 0]:  the DOJ after it had already spread，
[Speaker 0]:  put the document back online。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know what they changed。
[Speaker 0]:  so everyone is very confused。
[Speaker 0]:  people are still digging into this。
[Speaker 0]:  the original text of the document is here。
[Speaker 0]:  i won't read the english part aloud。
[Speaker 0]:  um um this is very，
[Speaker 0]:  very bad。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that this famous commentator jay taper also retweeted this tweet。
[Speaker 0]:  he said that the DOJ initially deleted the link and then put it back up this。
[Speaker 0]:  i think this content is too disturbing，
[Speaker 0]:  too disturbing。
[Speaker 0]:  and then you look at what he says next，
[Speaker 0]:  that the accusation is that apple was auctioning children with trump，
[Speaker 0]:  but mariloggo，
[Speaker 0]:  they call these people calendar girls。
[Speaker 0]:  i won't read the specific details。
[Speaker 0]:  it's too inappropriate。
[Speaker 0]:  you can check it out yourselves。
[Speaker 0]:  this is very，
[Speaker 0]:  very bad。
[Speaker 0]:  i looked at it，
[Speaker 0]:  and it's very similar to the plot of those adult novels。
[Speaker 0]:  i used to read on those adult websites。
[Speaker 1]:  i'm telling you um really，
[Speaker 0]:  if you don't look at the link if you don't click on it and find out that it's from DOJ dog gov。
[Speaker 0]:  you think it's a novel or that is some other countries online army doing propaganda，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  but that's not the case。
[Speaker 0]:  if you click on the PDF，
[Speaker 0]:  you can definitely see the original text after reading it。
[Speaker 0]:  i felt that all the rumors about AP have now been proven to be true。
[Speaker 0]:  there's more content after this。
[Speaker 0]:  i'll continue be the bill。
[Speaker 0]:  gates incident is also a big deal。
[Speaker 0]:  it's already been reported in many mainstream media outlets。
[Speaker 0]:  bill gates contracted this STD from the russian girl。
[Speaker 0]:  it's called STDTSTDI don't know if you're familiar with this。
[Speaker 0]:  i'm not very familiar with it。
[Speaker 0]:  are you you're not very familiar with it right？
[Speaker 0]:  i'm not very familiar with it。
[Speaker 0]:  loufy you have experience。
[Speaker 0]:  tell me，
[Speaker 0]:  uh，
[Speaker 0]:  i don't have experience。
[Speaker 0]:  i thought you might have experience。
[Speaker 0]:  but since you don't seem to understand，
[Speaker 0]:  let's just leave it at that this part about experiand is very interesting。
[Speaker 1]: 停车场。
[Speaker 0]:  he wrote a letter that he wanted to send to bill gates，
[Speaker 0]:  but it seems that the letter was saved in his draft folder a long letter。
[Speaker 0]:  why？
[Speaker 0]:  i think that at that time，
[Speaker 0]:  bill gates announced that they were going to several ties with apple。
[Speaker 0]:  he was very heard。
[Speaker 0]:  he wrote this long letter mentioning the BG asked stand for some anti biotics so that he could secretly give them to mellinda without her finding out why？
[Speaker 0]:  because after bill gates contracted this STD from these russian girls，
[Speaker 0]:  he transmitted to melininda，
[Speaker 0]:  so he wanted to cover it up before she found out。
[Speaker 0]:  it also mentioned a draft resignation letter allegedly written by his former scientific advisor boris chiege。
[Speaker 0]:  in a letter，
[Speaker 0]:  he complained about being forced to help gates obtain medication to deal with the consequences of having a relationship with a russian girl wait。
[Speaker 0]:  so when he had a relationship with a russian girl，
[Speaker 0]:  he didn't use protection，
[Speaker 0]:  of course，
[Speaker 0]:  not otherwise。
[Speaker 0]:  he wouldn't have gotten sick with he。
[Speaker 0]:  my goodness。
[Speaker 0]:  this medical knowledge is a bit okay，
[Speaker 0]:  but didn't he also not use protection when he was with mellinda？
[Speaker 0]:  judging from the result，
[Speaker 0]:  isn't your question a bit redundant。
[Speaker 0]:  hey，
[Speaker 0]:  these guys。
[Speaker 0]:  they are a bit lacking in medical knowledge。
[Speaker 0]:  well，
[Speaker 0]:  it's not a medical issue。
[Speaker 2]:  man。
[Speaker 2]:  this is something everyone understands how to have more fun，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  oh，
[Speaker 2]:  for the sake of fuund。
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  it seems like orrows has more experience。
[Speaker 0]:  he has experience。
[Speaker 0]:  you see，
[Speaker 0]:  this is a sexurelated disease of a neareal disease。
[Speaker 0]:  so we know that bill gates and melinnda divorce in twenty eleven。
[Speaker 0]:  melenda publicly stated the gatete's involvement with abstein was one of the reasons for the divorce，
[Speaker 0]:  but she never mentioned this venearial disease or the accusation of being secretly given drugs。
[Speaker 0]:  but i find it very strange。
[Speaker 0]:  you have to admit that the US has pretty strict controls on anti biotics，
[Speaker 0]:  even a billionaire like bill gates，
[Speaker 0]:  wanting to get an NT biotics had to go through upsteins。
[Speaker 0]:  so i wonder is this true？
[Speaker 0]:  isn't this just tabloid news？
[Speaker 0]:  the key is this is the original fbi document from the f。
[Speaker 0]:  four case。
[Speaker 0]:  you can go and look at it yourself。
[Speaker 0]:  this is a bit shocking。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see from this that these billionaires，
[Speaker 0]:  when dealing with some life problems are actually not much different from ordinary people。
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  and he probably didn't have much experience in this area before you see so many beautiful russian girls，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  your resistance isn't very high and you haven't dealt with these things before。
[Speaker 0]:  so he didn't have a channel to buy antibiotics or anything like that。
[Speaker 2]:  and then look at this even more incredible ylon muse。
[Speaker 2]:  ylon muse was tweeting nonsense on twitter before he invited me to go。
[Speaker 2]:  and i refused，
[Speaker 2]:  let's look at who sent this email。
[Speaker 2]:  it's from ylon，
[Speaker 2]:  musque november twenty fifty twenty twelve。
[Speaker 2]:  everyone knows that the plea bargain in the epin case，
[Speaker 2]:  ase compleplebefore twenty twenty ten。
[Speaker 2]:  so by twenty twelve，
[Speaker 2]:  these people all knew he had done what he was involved in what crime did he commit，
[Speaker 2]:  what kind of punishment did he receive？
[Speaker 2]:  everyone knows，
[Speaker 2]:  and then he sent out an email，
[Speaker 2]:  saying，
[Speaker 2]:  what day or night would be the wildest party on the island。
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 2]:  this is a small part from twenty twelve。
[Speaker 2]:  yes，
[Speaker 2]:  he said publicly that he was invited by upstein，
[Speaker 0]:  but he refused making himself seem virtuous。
[Speaker 0]:  but in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  he himself sent an email asking if it was possible to only have this party with epstein。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know who this person is and him，
[Speaker 0]:  and then the wildest party is on our island。
[Speaker 0]:  he really wanted to go right。
[Speaker 0]:  okay，
[Speaker 0]:  the following document is even more explosive。
[Speaker 0]:  this document is a confidential FBI informant report。
[Speaker 0]:  it records allegations from october twenty twenty concerning outside forces，
[Speaker 0]:  mainly involving israel，
[Speaker 0]:  russia and the UE，
[Speaker 0]:  possibly influencing the US election process and officials als most most incdible part is this abstein and dshuwitz durhuwitz is a very famous lawyer。
[Speaker 0]:  he's also a professor at harvard law school。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  that's right。
[Speaker 2]:  i need to add a little something for the audience about how great dirtiwz is。
[Speaker 2]:  everyone knows about the tanomyincident dent，
[Speaker 2]:  one，
[Speaker 2]:  one，
[Speaker 2]:  nine and eighty nine，
[Speaker 2]:  right after the t anomyan incident jongs emon in his group were a bit panic。
[Speaker 2]:  they wanted the economic system，
[Speaker 2]:  political system in judicial system to return to a more totalitarian authoritarian system。
[Speaker 2]:  so dangshelppying disagreed。
[Speaker 2]:  he insisted on southern inspection，
[Speaker 2]:  saying that the economic system still needed reform and the judicial system also needed limited reform to adapt to modern needs。
[Speaker 2]:  so in the early nineteen systems，
[Speaker 2]:  the entire sea CP，
[Speaker 2]:  the chinese government hope that the judicial system would also undergo appropriate reforms，
[Speaker 2]:  not as extensive as the economic system，
[Speaker 2]:  but still appropriate reforms。
[Speaker 2]:  so they thought about what kind of judicial system to learn from the conclusion they reached was to learn from the united states for two reasons。
[Speaker 2]:  at that time，
[Speaker 2]:  the united states was undoubtedly the world's number one superpower in the early nine nineand nineties，
[Speaker 2]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  another reason was that at that time，
[Speaker 2]:  the integration of civil law and common law systems was a trend。
[Speaker 2]:  simply put civil law systems like chinaare cautified law ridden down on paper。
[Speaker 2]:  common law systems are based on precedenence，
[Speaker 2]:  the ruling ings of the suprequcorter themselves part of the law。
[Speaker 2]:  so at that time，
[Speaker 2]:  the chinese government contacted the united states and asthem them to send the most prestigious，
[Speaker 2]:  most eminent and most the expert legal scholars to beijing to give open lectures。
[Speaker 2]:  these open lectures have limited seats，
[Speaker 2]:  and only those from large law firms，
[Speaker 2]:  promising young lawyers and young potential judges and prosecutors basically a group of promising young people in their thirties and forty。
[Speaker 2]:  yes。
[Speaker 2]:  were eligible to attend these master classes。
[Speaker 2]:  the team of legal experts sent by the united states was also highly regarded as the us，
[Speaker 2]:  also wanted to maintain good relations with china。
[Speaker 2]:  the leader of this team was dirshhuwitz also translated as diruwitz。
[Speaker 2]:  how powerful was he？
[Speaker 2]:  this can basically be confirmed from in direct evidence。
[Speaker 2]:  his personal level of experties was very high the content he taught in his master class in beijing was about the OJ simpsune case。
[Speaker 2]:  starting with the question，
[Speaker 2]:  why was simpson found to have killed his wife in the civil case，
[Speaker 2]:  resulting in a large compensation payment to his in laws，
[Speaker 2]:  but acquitted in the criminal trial。
[Speaker 2]:  in other words，
[Speaker 2]:  at the criminal level，
[Speaker 2]:  the accepted legal fact was that he did not kill his wife，
[Speaker 2]:  but in the civil lawsuit，
[Speaker 2]:  the accepted legal fact was that simpson did kill his wife。
[Speaker 2]:  so what exactly happened，
[Speaker 2]:  diruwitz said that procedural justice is more important than individual justice in the criminal prosecution process。
[Speaker 2]:  there were issues with evidence contamination，
[Speaker 2]:  fingerprint contamination inadequate search warrants estura too many flaws in the prosecutions evidence。
[Speaker 2]:  therefore，
[Speaker 2]:  they prefer to sacrifice individual justice to ensure procedural justice。
[Speaker 2]:  this demonstrates how powerful dirtuwitz was so returning to today the fact that estein could have a relationship with someone like dirtiwitz shows how extensive his network was epstein and dshhuwitz were old friends。
[Speaker 0]:  very good friends，
[Speaker 0]:  joshuwitz represented abstein。
[Speaker 0]:  in his case，
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  he was his lawyer。
[Speaker 0]:  yes。
[Speaker 0]:  and this allen duruwitz hihimself as AEE，
[Speaker 0]:  and he is very pro israel。
[Speaker 0]:  he basically supports israel and sienism。
[Speaker 0]:  in every aspect。
[Speaker 0]:  this is his very clear stance in the article。
[Speaker 0]:  one read。
[Speaker 0]:  it also mentioned that urshotexexplicitly said that if he were decades younger，
[Speaker 0]:  he would have directly joined the most sad with a gun，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  i'll tell you he is arguabably one of the successful criminal defence lawyers in american history。
[Speaker 0]:  he graduated from yale law school at the top of his class，
[Speaker 0]:  and later served as a legal assistant to a supreme court justice，
[Speaker 0]:  which is a very rare position in the nineteen sixties。
[Speaker 0]:  he taught it harvard last school，
[Speaker 0]:  becoming the youngest tenior professor in harvard history。
[Speaker 0]:  at the age of twenty eight。
[Speaker 0]:  he taught it harvard ard for fifty years，
[Speaker 0]:  retiring twenty thirty thirteen。
[Speaker 0]:  he has defended several cases，
[Speaker 0]:  including the OJ simpson murder trial，
[Speaker 0]:  the mike tison case，
[Speaker 0]:  the pentagon paper's case，
[Speaker 0]:  the clinton presidential scandal and lawsuits related to the two thousand eight presidential election。
[Speaker 0]:  he also defended controversial celebrities like harvey wine steam，
[Speaker 0]:  especially those involved in sexual assaullar harassment cases dirshuwitz parparticularly skilled at handling in these cases，
[Speaker 0]:  which is why he also defended upstein in this document，
[Speaker 0]:  the informent directly accuses him of collaborating with most sad agents。
[Speaker 0]:  the informment explicitly stated that he was a recruted mosad agent。
[Speaker 0]:  this also connects to what we've discussed many times before the connection between epin and the the saad，
[Speaker 0]:  including his girlfriend，
[Speaker 0]:  whose father was also a mosad agent。
[Speaker 0]:  all these relationships are connected yit，
[Speaker 0]:  essentially confirms it。
[Speaker 0]:  at the same time。
[Speaker 0]:  this document also suggests that trump had several suspicious real estate transactions that were influenced by israel。
[Speaker 0]:  it implies that trump is essentially a leader controlled by israel。
[Speaker 0]:  cutioner is the maaster mine behind the scenes，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if everyone knows about cutioner，
[Speaker 0]:  but he's also jewish。
[Speaker 0]:  i think，
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  that's right。
[Speaker 0]:  so you can see that this narrative that the right wing has been spreading for years that some jewish group has been controlling。
[Speaker 0]:  the president has now been seemingly proven true by these things。
[Speaker 0]:  this is a development。
[Speaker 0]:  i didn't expect it all。
[Speaker 0]:  this is the original text。
[Speaker 0]:  you can all go and look at it。
[Speaker 0]:  this document can be found on the government's official website。
[Speaker 0]:  yit basically says that israel。
[Speaker 0]:  this small country is sterning up trouble everywhere and has kidnap the united states。
[Speaker 0]:  this is actually quite worrying。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  you can see that epsteine CHSI think CHS is his。
[Speaker 0]:  it said the dirtihutz once told alexa costa。
[Speaker 0]:  oh，
[Speaker 0]:  this is what dirshhutz told him here。
[Speaker 0]:  dishuwitz told him that exsteine belong to the US and israeli intelligence agencies。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  most adcontacted dirshuwitz to report back former prime minister barck，
[Speaker 0]:  and these others are all connected now，
[Speaker 0]:  then there's our common secretary wilbaross。
[Speaker 0]:  i don't know if you seen the program i did about ross，
[Speaker 0]:  which was based on an interview with him when he was interviewed by the media，
[Speaker 0]:  he said that he went to esteenen's place in thousand thousand five to see his wife，
[Speaker 0]:  and they saw a large massage table in the living room，
[Speaker 0]:  then he decided that this person was too terrible，
[Speaker 0]:  and they should cut ties with him。
[Speaker 0]:  so they didn't have any further contact，
[Speaker 0]:  then we saw an email from twenty twelve sent by howard ldneck。
[Speaker 0]:  he said that we will be landing in same thomas this saturday afternoon，
[Speaker 0]:  and then we will go to the island where you on monday。
[Speaker 0]:  should we have dinner together this sunday night？
[Speaker 0]:  i have another couple with me，
[Speaker 0]:  and we have four children two sixteen year olds，
[Speaker 0]:  two fourteen old old，
[Speaker 0]:  one thirteen year old and one twelve year old。
[Speaker 0]:  he even told him their ages。
[Speaker 0]:  this shows that ltneck was lying during the interview。
[Speaker 0]:  he was completely lying。
[Speaker 0]:  he was still planning to have dinner with him in twenty twelve，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  yes，
[Speaker 2]:  i also watch that interview。
[Speaker 2]:  he described it quite meticuously。
[Speaker 2]:  he spoke very carefully。
[Speaker 0]:  and in great detail，
[Speaker 0]:  saying that they had absolutely no contact。
[Speaker 2]:  first of all，
[Speaker 2]:  the two of them were neighbors living door to door。
[Speaker 2]:  then one day，
[Speaker 2]:  his wife said to him，
[Speaker 2]:  a new person has moved in across the street。
[Speaker 2]:  shouldn't we go over and say，
[Speaker 2]:  hello。
[Speaker 2]:  so they went over and that's when they met upstein。
[Speaker 2]:  they saw a massage table in the middle of the living room，
[Speaker 2]:  and he found very strstrange。
[Speaker 0]:  he elt parparcucularly disgusted him asked，
[Speaker 2]:  why is this massage table here？
[Speaker 2]:  he asked him what the table was for。
[Speaker 2]:  and estein said，
[Speaker 2]:  i like this massage young girls come every day to give me a massage。
[Speaker 2]:  when rotney heard this，
[Speaker 2]:  he thought my god，
[Speaker 2]:  this isn't a normal person，
[Speaker 2]:  and immediately left saying he never stepped foot in their house again。
[Speaker 0]:  yes，
[Speaker 0]:  this is from a recent interview he did with a fox news ankor。
[Speaker 0]:  i think or maybe a youtube，
[Speaker 0]:  you can check it out online，
[Speaker 0]:  clearly lying。
[Speaker 0]:  he didn't step foot in their house，
[Speaker 0]:  but he could step two steps onto their island，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 2]:  orioriinal statement ment that he had no contact with him at all。
[Speaker 2]:  so that's it。
[Speaker 2]:  there's nothing more to it。
[Speaker 0]:  he shouldn't have said that the next part is very explosive。
[Speaker 0]:  this section is also from his document william bar claimed that he met a victim。
[Speaker 0]:  this is supposed to be a victim who said the while participating in motorcycle activities at esteine's place。
[Speaker 0]:  she met bar and bar，
[Speaker 0]:  said he hoped to see her again next time。
[Speaker 0]:  another time，
[Speaker 0]:  epstein asked the victim if she had met bar，
[Speaker 0]:  william bar is no ordinary person。
[Speaker 0]:  he served again as a torney general in the trump administration。
[Speaker 0]:  in february，
[Speaker 0]:  twenty nineteen teen epstein was arrested in july of the same year and subsequently died in prison。
[Speaker 0]:  all the timings overlap。
[Speaker 0]:  the entire department of justice during epsteenes incarceration was under bars。
[Speaker 0]:  leadership was a bar who silened him。
[Speaker 0]:  we don't know，
[Speaker 0]:  we just don't know。
[Speaker 0]:  so now you know why this whole thing is so complicated，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  like bar said this was a suicide。
[Speaker 0]:  there's nothing to see here。
[Speaker 0]:  everyone move along。
[Speaker 0]:  don't investigate。
[Speaker 0]:  he mself is even in this document。
[Speaker 1]:  um this part of the content is actually very explosive。
[Speaker 0]:  you can take another look at it。
[Speaker 0]:  this is the fbs email content。
[Speaker 0]:  this is about the elmin interview，
[Speaker 0]:  which is probably a preinterview transcripfrom epstein。
[Speaker 0]:  you can see a lot of details，
[Speaker 0]:  and it also involves trump and prince。
[Speaker 0]:  andrew，
[Speaker 0]:  i won't read this content aloud。
[Speaker 0]:  it's very sensitive。
[Speaker 0]:  you can look it up yourselves。
[Speaker 0]:  so these are some new developments in the apple case involving over three million documents。
[Speaker 0]:  there are still many documents that people are digging through。
[Speaker 0]:  some analysts say that some people within the FBI were very dissatisfied with being asked to work overtime to cover up for trump in these wealthy people。
[Speaker 0]:  so during this release process，
[Speaker 0]:  they simply released all the sensitive information as well。
[Speaker 0]:  um and in fact，
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  with so many documents，
[Speaker 0]:  if you want people to go through them，
[Speaker 0]:  one by one，
[Speaker 0]:  you'll consume a lot of man，
[Speaker 0]:  power and resources。
[Speaker 0]:  these people don't have nothing else to do，
[Speaker 0]:  you know，
[Speaker 0]:  they still have to catch real criminals and solve cases if everyone just stopped everything else。
[Speaker 0]:  and just looked at these pdf trying to find those involve with certain keywords and then hiding their names。
[Speaker 0]:  that's not very realistic。
[Speaker 0]:  this could be done by a eye，
[Speaker 0]:  right？
[Speaker 0]:  so there will be more insider information about these documents released，
[Speaker 0]:  and you can continue to follow this。
[Speaker 0]:  there's a lot on twitter and reporters from various media outlets should also be working on this，
[Speaker 0]:  so you can continue to watch。
