President Donald Trump recently
announced he'll introduce a 10%
tariff on eight allies who were
opposed to US control of
Greenland.
He threatened that the tariff
would rise to 25% if there's
no action by June.
In response,
Prime Minister Mark Carney
said the following.
We're concerned about this
escalation.
We will always support
sovereignty and territorial
integrity of countries
wherever their geographic
location is.
Decisions about the future of
Greenland are for Greenland
and Denmark to decide.
Trump is clearly not on
the same page.
So what role can and should
Canada play here?
How can we protect our
historical alliances
when our allies are
so dramatically at odds?
I got insight from Kerry Buck,
former Canadian ambassador
to NATO, Globe and Mail
columnist Andrew Coyne,
and Seva Gunitsky, an
associate professor of
political science at the
University of Toronto.
I appreciate all three of you
for joining to unpack
all of these headlines.
I want to start with a sort of
quick reaction.
If I was to ask you
a month ago, how would you react
if someone told you
that a bunch of NATO countries
were going to send troops
to Greenland to deter Trump's
threats to invade it,
or that he would threaten them
with tariffs,
Andrew, what would you say?
>> A month ago, I'm not sure I
would have been that surprised.
He's been on an escalatory
spiral for some time.
His behaviour has been getting
worse and worse and worse.
And the best rule of thumb is
whatever you think is as bad as
it can get now, it's going to
get worse tomorrow.
So a year ago, if you'd asked
me, I would have said,
oh, come on, not even
Trump's that crazy.
But we've been watching
over the last year how much
worse it's it's becoming.
>> Seva, was this on your bingo
card?
>> Well, I agree with Andrew
that this is something he's
been escalating toward.
So a month ago, I wouldn't
have been as surprised.
Maybe even a year ago,
I wouldn't be surprised,
but I'm sort of pleasantly
surprised, that is, that the
Europeans are taking this
seriously and they're sending
troops.
These are symbolic numbers.
But at the same time,
it's sending a message that we
will stand up to this.
We're not going to be bullied.
We have the political strength,
and strength is the only
language Trump understands.
So hopefully that sends the
message that he needs to hear.
>> Gary.
>> I'm shocked, but not
surprised.
Trump has indeed gone on
about Greenland, but Greenland
has also been a part of
the security kind of
architecture of the US since
the Cold War.
But I'm shocked because this is
the first time the US has
openly threatened a military
action against an ally
since well before the war, so
an odd direction that doesn't
serve US interests at all.
Yes, the Europeans have
responded in a way,
but this is a previously
planned exercise and the main
message is to Russia.
But ancillary messages
to the US as well that
NATO's got this.
>> Gary, you mentioned the
Europeans.
Let's talk Canadians.
Of course, Prime Minister
Carney expressed solidarity
with Greenland, yet hasn't sent
troops to Greenland as of yet.
What do you make of that?
>> Well, I think Canada's first
job is to defend the principle
of sovereign equality of states,
not inviolability of state
borders and self-determination
of indigenous peoples.
What all that adds up to
is send the message that
international law matters,
and that the US can get
what it wants through
existing mechanisms like NATO
and their defence treaty.
They don't need to muse about
invading Greenland.
It undercuts NATO,
it undercuts US interests.
>> Should Canada be sending in
troops?
>> First question is, should
anybody?
And clearly, yes, the
Europeans need to.
This is crossing all kinds of
lines, not just vis a vis
the United States, but also
they've got to be keeping
one eye on Russia as well.
So, as we said, force is
the only language Trump
understands.
They tried appeasement
and flattery and bribery
and none of those have worked.
So if the Europeans are
going to be sending troops
there, I think the question is,
should Canada?
I think it has to be, yes,
we need allies at this point
in time, more than we ever have.
We've not always been
a good ally.
We really need to step up
and be a responsible ally now.
So if they're sending troops,
we have to as well.
>> Can we clarify how many
troops are we talking about
at this moment?
We're talking a handful.
>> Yeah, exactly.
They are I think it was said
there's some it's
a symbolic force.
It's what they call
a tripwire.
But we'll see.
It may grow into a larger force.
The point is they want to
make it clear to Trump,
this is not going to be, you
know, rolling in and taking out
Nicolas Maduro.
If you're doing this,
you're facing military
consequences potentially.
But certainly you're facing
all kinds of other consequences
in terms of trade policy,
in terms of closing US bases,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
>> Well, Carney is kind of an
impossible situation here.
He has to slowly distance
himself from the US,
but still kind of maintain
a pleasant facade towards Trump.
That's right.
It's kind of like, you know,
you meet a wild bear in the
woods, you back away slowly,
but maintain eye contact or
he'll take that as weakness.
So as far as sending troops,
I don't know.
I don't know if it might be
seen as a provocation
or if it would be helpful.
Clearly there has to be
something more than saying
nothing.
So I think the thing to do
for Canada is to keep
strengthening military presence
in the Arctic, sort of slowly
and patiently, and increase
surveillance capabilities so
that if us complains, they can
say, look, we are taking this
seriously.
And I think that's the safe
but boring way to go forward.
>> Okay, I'll get you to add on
that.
If it's not troops, what
should Canada be doing?
>> Well, I think the thing
right now is to de-escalate,
de-escalate with Trump, but
also to double down in the
Arctic, as Eva said, and to
double down on reinforcing the
principles behind NATO.
So to de-escalate, I think
sending Canada sending troops
this week would be a mistake.
We're vulnerable this week,
after Carney's trip to China
and waiting to see how Trump
reacts.
So far, the reaction has been
fairly positive, but we're more
vulnerable right now.
I think slow and steady
is the order of the day.
So diplomacy centred
around NATO, centred around
Arctic, and when we do more in
the Arctic, anchor it in NATO
because, as Andrew said, we
need allies to do anything.
And it's an important
political signal right now too.
>> Andrew, I'll get you to take
the word diplomacy is thrown
around, but we're dealing with
Trump here.
So if it's not troops,
what is it?
>> Well, it's got to be if
you're talking about Canada's
interests, it's got to be
diplomacy.
Plus we just being nice to Trump
is not going to do it.
Just, you know, talk softly
etc.
We have to show that we have
allies.
We have to show that we have
options.
That's part of the point of
the China trip.
We've got to show that
we're not to be messed with,
that we will be the porcupine,
that if you try to play with us,
you're going to get stung.
These all have to be
part of the puzzle.
You can wrap it in a cool,
calm demeanour.
You can wrap it in
unprovocative language, but the
message behind the scenes has
got to be sent is we're not
going to be pushed around
as we have options.
We have abilities to make
that point.
>> All right.
Setting Greenland aside,
the recent arrest of
President Maduro in Venezuela,
to what extent could it
embolden the Trump
administration, Trump himself,
to intervene in other countries?
We've heard a number of
countries been listed Colombia,
Mexico, Cuba and of course,
Canada.
What does this what is
this message send here?
>> Well, the the Maduro
operation was designed to be
quick and easy, sort of
literally fly in, grab the guy
and his wife and fly out.
No occupation, no.
No American casualties,
no American boots on the ground.
That seems to be
the template that Trump prefers.
Keep it to a single news cycle.
Don't get bogged down in in
something that where he has to
spend political capital.
So yes, we could see
something similar with maybe
Cuba, some kind of leadership
decapitation or Colombia
under the pretext of fighting
drug trafficking or
something like that.
But a real occupation
requires political stamina.
And frankly, I don't think
the administration has
the attention span for
something like that.
Trump once again wins.
That fit in in a
single news cycle.
>> Kerry.
>> Well, Trump's definitely got
the wind in his sails.
He sees using the military
as a tool to achieve
some immediate
transactional benefits.
He sees that as a good thing.
The problem is that there's
no one in his administration
that thinks through the second
and third order effects.
So even in Venezuela,
what was a short,
sharp operation, you know,
think through what's going to
happen over the medium term in
Venezuela.
And is that going to be
in the interest of the US?
It's not clear that it is.
So it's a conundrum because
there's no one left in the
administration who will tell
Trump when he's going in the
wrong direction.
Second problem created for
the American military.
You know, the Washington Treaty,
the NATO treaty is the law
of the land in the US.
So if they were to
move militarily on Greenland,
they're violating American law
as well as the Washington
Treaty.
How does that place
American military?
Are they going to obey
those illegal orders?
That's a really hard place
to put people in.
>> It's been troubling because
so far, lower ranking officers
have been obeying illegal
orders.
This stuff in the Caribbean,
for example.
But invading Greenland.
Others have made the point.
All of the members of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff
would have to resign morally
and legally in the face of
that kind of command.
Whether they will or not
remains to be seen if it comes
to that.
But, you know, there's
a tendency we always have to
guard against the tendency to
ascribe normalcy to Trump, to
ascribe normal motives, normal
assessments.
He's out of his mind,
and he's surrounded by people
who are not clinically
out of their mind, but are
fanatics and cannot be assessed.
So yes, he's he goes in for
military operations that are
theatrical, that look good on
TV and, and usually I would say
if you're talking about any
other leader.
Oh come on, that's not how
the world works with this.
You have to really look at it
through that lens.
>> So in light of all of this,
how vulnerable to annexation is
Canada's Arctic region?
>> Well, Canada right now,
I think is still in a different
category than even Greenland.
And in fact, there was some
white House staffers said just
yesterday that when it comes to
conversations inside the Oval
Office, there's no talk of
purchasing anything.
There's no talk of invading
anything Canadian-related.
But that doesn't mean things
can't change.
Obviously, it doesn't mean
Canada can relax the
there's still continuing
economic diplomatic pressure.
There's still the possibility
of that.
So the threat is not
so much tanks rolling over the
borders.
But you know that does
not mean that there's no threat.
And it's something that Canada
should must continue to take
seriously.
Absolutely, Gary.
>> Yeah.
There's no immediate
military threat in our Arctic
from anyone, primarily because
the operating environment makes
it too hard.
But that's not a static thing.
And with melting of sea ice,
that will change over time.
There are a number of
points of vulnerability for
Canada, the Northwest Passage
and contested views of who owns
that.
I could see Trump wanting
to own that, and we also
haven't done enough
traditionally the last few
decades in the Arctic.
So as I said earlier,
we really need to double down
and increase our military
and civilian security apparatus
in the Arctic.
So we project Canadian
sovereignty and send
a message to adversaries
that we've got this.
But also it's like defence
against help, unwanted help
from the US.
And that's really important.
>> All right.
We talked about this
a little bit sort of that
tightrope that Canada has to
sort of walk between being a
good NATO ally, an honourable
player on the world stage,
but not damaging sort of the
already touchy relationship
with the US.
How do we do that?
>> I'm not sure that we can
avoid, quote unquote, damaging
the relationship.
The relationship has been
damaged when you've got the
president of the United States
talking about annexing Canada,
you're not in normal times.
Right?
So I think the two are actually
linked is by being a
responsible ally to other
countries, we are sending
the right signal to the United
States.
We don't have to be aggressive
about it.
We don't have to be belligerent
about it, but we can be firm
about it.
And and that is as I say,
it said already that that is
really the only language that
he understands.
But patiently promoting
our interests, making it clear
that that, that we're
not simply going to roll over
the minute you send that signal
thinking you're going to get
short term relief, you're just
buying yourself more long term
pain.
>> Okay.
Seva.
>> Yeah, I mean, I agree Canada
has to hedge given the
situation and try to see closer
relationships with other
countries, whether it's China
or the EU or maybe India down
the road.
You know, Carney comes from
the finance world.
So he knows if you're if your
biggest stock is tanking,
the stock being the Canadian
American relationship, you have
to diversify your portfolio.
You don't need to be in finance
to know that.
So Canada and other countries
too will will continue
to try to become less dependent
on the US, given the continuing
unpredictability of Trump's
foreign policy.
That's not going away
in the short term.
So in that sense,
Canada's strategy, I think, is
the right one.
>> All right.
We'll get to China.
Just I want to get Kerry's
take on balancing that
tightrope.
>> Diversify our trade and
economic relationships.
But at the same time
don't do it as one-off
set of transactions,
because then you fall into a
trump trap behaving like Trump.
Well, you need alliances.
You need allies who will
come if you get into trouble,
for instance, in the Arctic
or on trading relationships
and tariffs.
And in order to do that,
you have to reinforce
some of those tables where we
already have allies like NATO
and parts of the UN, I'd say,
and build new alliances with
countries that are natural
allies.
But we've let life flow
like Mexico and South Korea,
and they're doing some of that.
So build that up.
So you've got friends
when something bad hits the fan
and at the same time,
you know, geography matters
and it's inescapable for us.
And they're always going to be
a big trading relationship.
They're always going to be
a big security partner.
The US is.
So there are parts of the US
system that I hope are waking
up to the outrageous position
that Trump's taking on
Greenland.
>> Greenland has served a
valuable purpose in that.
It has, I think,
welcomed people up.
And it is, I think, for some
people to work and move
together.
Where Trump succeeds
is when he can keep people
isolated and pick them off
and play them off against
each other.
Whether you're talking
domestic politics
or internationally
and both domestically and
internationally, there is,
I think, a growing cohesion.
Still a long way to go, perhaps,
but a growing cohesion of
realising that we have to, you
know, Ben, Ben Franklin said,
hang together or we'll all hang
separately.
>> There we go.
Let's talk a little bit
about the diversification of
our trade.
Prime Minister Mark Carney, of
course, was just in China to
reset relationships there a
step in the right direction,
I assume.
>> Depending on how big a step
you, the value in it, the
validity, it is reducing your
dependence on the United States,
which is a matter not so much
now of the of economics, but of
national security.
We cannot be so dependent
on them.
They can use that against us,
but we don't want to fall into
the equal and opposite trap
of becoming overly dependent
on China, because China will
certainly use against us.
So we want to have
some equipoise, balancing them
off against each other,
having other players as well.
India was mentioned, Europe,
of course.
So as long as it's that
as long as we don't,
we're not rushing into
the arms of China, but simply
trying to prudently diversify
our portfolio, then I think
it's a step in the right
direction.
>> Seva.
>> Yeah.
So I don't know if it's right
to call it the right step
or the wrong step.
It's sort of a necessary step at
this point, given the situation
that comes with its own costs,
as already been mentioned.
But Canada is overleveraged
on relationship with the US.
I think that's that's fair
to say.
And so reaching out to China
is not anti-Americanism.
That's just basic
risk management at this point.
I think now the problem for
for Carney and for Canada
is that you don't want
to get into this spiral where
you hedge away from America.
And Trump sees that as an
insult and puts more pressure,
which forces Canada to hedge
more.
That's not a sustainable
spiral, not not a sustainable
cycle.
So Carney has to keep
threading that needle,
basically of, you know,
diversify enough to have
options and to show that we
have options, but not so much
that it becomes a source of
grievance for Trump, who is
essentially driven by
grievances, personal grievances
for his foreign policy.
>> So Canada was the first of
Washington's allies to reach
out in this kind of structured
way, to put the relationship
with China back on some kind of
footing.
So I think that's an
important message to the US.
I agree that the pragmatic areas
that the PM and the government
has picked out to cooperate
with China make a lot of sense
right now.
The challenge will be keeping it
in that box.
And I'm not convinced
that China has the same
understanding of what the
limits and the guardrails
are for that relationship.
And, you know,
the China that interfered in
domestic affairs prior to the
deal is the same China that
we'll do it afterwards.
The good thing is that
there'll be a lot more channels
to talk to China about
these worries.
But the difficult thing
to manage is that we've got
more invested now
and they're bigger than us.
And so it'll be really hard
pushing back when China wants
to do something that's not in
Canada's interests.
>> Okay.
Early days.
We have a minute left.
I have one question
for all of you.
Out of ten, how would you rate
Canada in its foreign policy
right now?
>> Oh, it's very hard for me
to reduce that to a number.
I mean, I grade my students
papers, so maybe.
>> That's why you go to you
first.
>> Yeah.
I mean it's Canada
right now is being very
pragmatic and not being sort of
splashy rhetorically, which is
the right thing.
It's doing what it should be
doing.
I'm not sure I can put a
number on that,
but that's my evaluation.
>> Kerry.
>> I think they're doing a
really good job at threading
a needle.
The challenge right now
is that there's some principles
that are important.
And in Canada's interests
that haven't been spoken about
a lot, sovereign equality,
democracy and those kind of
values that get us,
the allies we need and
that are really compelling.
So that's an area where I'd give
them maybe a six out of ten,
but on the rest of it, I'd give
them an eight and a half out of
ten.
>> Principles and values are
very important, but we're also
faced with a series of
judgement calls.
There's no kind of, you know,
out of the box policy
that you can enact here
that will solve this when
you're dealing with a one-off
or one of a kind like Trump,
who just does not react the way
any normal world leader does,
I would I would cut a lot of
slack to anybody who was in the
Prime Minister's job, but it
really places a premium on
judgement and, and leadership.
And that's that's really how
we're going to assess him going
forward.
And of course, weighing him
against other potential leaders
in that regard.
>> And that's unfortunately
where we're going to leave it.
I'm sure we will have this
conversation at another time.
Andrew Carey, thank you so much.
Really appreciate it.
