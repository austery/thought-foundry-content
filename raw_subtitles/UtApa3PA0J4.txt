OK, imagine this: you're in the UK, it's grey and 
raining—as usual—and someone pitches you the idea  
to run a 4,000-kilometre extension cord from 
your house to the deserts of Morocco – so that  
you can power your kettle with solar energy...
That’s basically what XLinks – the now cancelled  
green energy power project was. In what was 
supposed to be a triumph of engineering and  
climate ambition, the Xlinks Morocco-UK Power 
Project was designed to be a 77 square mile  
solar array, a 580 square mile wind farm and 
a 50 square mile battery array all based in  
Morocco and connected to the UK with the world's 
longest undersea power cable. The project would  
have supplied 8% of the UK's electricity at 
a cost of twenty-four billion pounds – and  
that’s if you believe that there wouldn’t 
be cost overruns – which there always are…
 
Critics of the project called it 'green 
colonialism' - with Greenpeace saying that  
it was just another case of the Global North 
exploiting the Global South for energy. While  
Africa’s strong solar and wind potential make 
it an attractive place to produce green energy,  
many residents question that the energy 
should be exported rather than used locally.
 
Unfortunately, the XLinks project has joined 
a growing graveyard of planned megaprojects  
that are grand in vision, bloated in cost, and 
ultimately undone by their own complexity. 
 
From high-speed rail lines that never reach their 
destination to nuclear plants with underwater  
acoustic systems—dubbed 'the fish disco' by the 
press—which is supposed to deter marine life,  
western countries have become astonishingly bad 
at building core infrastructure. The question  
is no longer why these projects fail—but 
whether we’ve forgotten how to succeed. 
 
XLinks was supposed to be privately funded but the 
developers were depending on a 25-year Contract  
for Difference—or CfD—from the UK government – 
which is a fancy way of saying: 'We’ll build it,  
but the government has to guarantee us a 
fixed price for the electricity for the  
next twenty-five years – so while not officially 
subsidized – this was a type of subsidy and the  
project won’t be going ahead without it.
That price? £70 to £80 pounds per megawatt  
hour – which is actually not bad for the UK. 
It’s cheaper than nuclear and competitive with  
offshore wind. But it’s by no means a bargain. 
It is about three times the wholesale cost  
of electricity in the United States – so 
energy hungry industry would still be at  
a significant disadvantage if manufacturing in 
the UK. That Contract for Difference would’ve  
meant billions of pounds in government price 
guarantees over the next twenty-five years.
 
So, let’s talk about transmission losses next. 
High Voltage Direct Current or HVDC cables lose  
about 3.5% of their power per thousand 
kilometers. With a 4000-kilometer cable  
that’s 14% in losses. Then you’ve got battery 
losses on top of that of another 10 to 15%.  
So, you’re losing more than a quarter of 
your energy before it even hits the UK grid.
 
Imagine ordering a pizza and the delivery guy 
eats a quarter of it on the way. That’s Xlinks.
 
The project’s estimated cost jumped from 
£20 billion to £24 billion pounds before  
a single solar panel was installed. The 
planned battery array would have been  
16 times larger than the world’s largest 
completed battery system—occupying fifty  
square miles in the Moroccan desert. The subsea 
cable would have been the longest in the world,  
traversing deep-sea environments 
and multiple jurisdictions.
 
Channels like the Commonsense Sceptic 
have criticized similar ideas that have  
been pitched in the United States due to their 
reliance on unproven scale, the vulnerability  
to transmission losses, and the sheer material 
intensity of the battery systems, the singular  
vulnerability to terrorist attacks and damage 
from storms or extreme weather events. 
 
Ed Miliband, the UK’s Energy Secretary, rejected 
the proposal a few weeks ago. The project,  
he said, had “too many holes and didn’t provide 
value for money. He cited security concerns,  
delivery risk, and a lack of domestic 
economic benefit. He expressed a preference  
for 'homegrown renewables’ - Translation: 
'We’d rather build wind farms in Yorkshire  
than run a 4,000 km extension cord to Africa.'
Xlinks is unfortunately not an outlier—it’s part  
of a bigger pattern. The UK’s infrastructure 
ambitions are littered with projects that start  
with fanfare and end in farce. HS2, the high-speed 
rail line meant to connect London to the North,  
saw its northern leg scrapped after costs 
ballooned past £100 billion pounds. Along  
the way, it spent £119 million pounds on 
a special tunnel to preserve a protected  
bat colony—despite there being no evidence 
that high-speed trains interfere with bats.
 
Then there’s Hinkley Point C, the nuclear plant 
in Somerset, now expected to cost £46 billion  
pounds. Among its more surprising features: 
a proposed “fish disco”—an acoustic deterrent  
system designed to keep marine life away from the 
cooling water intake. EDF, the plant’s developer,  
tried to abandon this part of the plan, citing 
diver safety and questionable effectiveness,  
but environmental campaigners pushed back. 
The fish disco may have to go ahead.

Britain’s failed infrastructure projects reflect  
a deeper malaise – not just in the UK, but 
in much of the developed world: of a system  
of development that overpromises, underdelivers, 
and gets bogged down in a tangle of regulation,  
litigation, and political risk aversion. As 
the Danish economist Bent Flyvbjerg has noted,  
megaprojects are “almost always over budget, 
over time, and under benefit” due to a mix  
of psychological bias, political incentives, and 
structural complexity. He identifies a phenomenon  
he calls the “iron law of megaprojects,” where 
nine out of ten projects incur cost overruns,  
delays, or fail to deliver expected benefits.
This poor performance is driven by what he terms  
the “four sublimes”: the technological, political, 
economic, and aesthetic thrills that motivate  
planners to pursue grand projects, often at the 
expense of realism. When this is combined with  
flawed forecasting, strategic misrepresentation, 
and a tendency to ignore lessons of the past,  
these forces lead to what he calls the “survival 
of the unfittest”—where the most misleadingly  
optimistic projects are approved but 
are then - the most likely to fail.
 
Megaprojects are tangible, garner attention, and 
lend an air of proactiveness to political leaders.  
On top of that - they tend to be media magnets – 
and the attention they draw appeals to promoters  
who enjoy few things more than the visibility 
they get from announcing a new megaproject.
 
A few months ago I was listening to a podcast 
from the Irish economist David McWilliams called  
“Why do good People Make Bad decisions? In the 
podcast he pointed out that megaprojects didn’t  
always stall out like they seem to today. 
He used the example of Ireland in the 1920s,  
which had just come through a war of independence, 
a civil war, and with a fragile democracy in  
place, managed to build the Ardnacrusha 
hydroelectric plant in just three years.
 
Ireland at the time was a post-colonial state 
with no money, no industry, and no energy.  
It had what is described as a beer and 
biscuits economy, where the only real  
industry in the country was Guinnesses and 
Jacobs. Both of which drew on agriculture,  
so there was no real industrial base at all.
There were no large deposits of fossil fuels  
in Ireland like there were in other European 
countries – so there had been no real industrial  
revolution – where cheap energy could be converted 
into production. Irish people instead moved abroad  
if they wanted to find jobs in industry.
Electricity was a very new technology at  
the time and the leadership of the country 
spent 20% of GDP over three years to build  
Ardnacrusha - a hydroelectric power plant 
which until the Hoover Dam was built in  
1933 was the largest hydroelectric dam 
in the world. The country also built an  
electrical grid which brought power not just 
to cities, but to farms all over the country.
 
Between 1937 and 1947, the river 
Liffey was dammed at Poulaphouca  
to build a second hydroelectric station – 
this dam created a reservoir that delivered  
fresh drinking water to every home in Dublin.
So why was a poor country able to build huge  
high-tech infrastructure like this in just a few 
years – which benefitted most of the population  
and dragged the country into the modern world 
when today it is impossible to build enough  
housing for the population or even a new road?
McWilliams argues in his podcast that Western  
societies have today become victims of 
“hyperdemocracy”—a system where everyone  
has a veto, but no one has responsibility. 
He argues that well-intentioned regulation,  
environmentalism, NIMBYISM and localism have 
created a system so overburdened that even basic  
infrastructure becomes impossible to deliver.
As an example, let’s talk about Hinkley Point  
C—Britain’s flagship nuclear project – which also 
happens to be the most expensive nuclear power  
station that has ever been built. Hinkley Point 
C is four times more expensive per megawatt to  
similar plants that are being built in South 
Korea, and even costs 25% more than a near  
identical plant in France that 
was built by the same company.
 
Why is it so much more expensive? 
Because in Britain, we can’t just  
build things—we have to reinvent them.
Instead of just building a proven design – it  
was decided to modify it. A lot. The UK’s nuclear 
regulator required 7,000 design changes to  
EDF’s already-approved reactor. The changes 
required 25% more concrete, 35% more steel,  
and a reactor so bespoke it’s now known as the “UK 
EPR”—a brand-new design in everything but name.
 
To protect 45 tons of fish per year—less than 
a small fishing boat catches—EDF was asked to  
install 288 underwater speakers blasting 
noise to scare the fish away. I’m guessing  
Michael Bolton – Phil Collins – or something like 
that. This is expensive, it’s risky for divers,  
and it might delay the entire project. 
All this while climate change – a bigger  
threat to biodiversity, marches on.
Even though multiple versions of this  
plant have been built already, a 31,000-page 
environmental impact assessment was needed and  
then, even minor changes - trigger new planning 
applications, legal reviews, and years of delay.
 
Compare that to Ireland in the 1920s where a 
poor country with no industrial base was able  
to build the largest hydroelectric plant 
in the world in just three years. Today,  
we can’t even build a road without a decade 
of consultations and a tunnel for bats.
 
My point isn’t that we should give up on 
big projects. It’s that we should stop  
making them needlessly complicated. South 
Korea builds fleets of reactors using the  
same design over and over. They’ve mastered 
replication while we’ve mastered reinvention.
 
If we want to fix our energy problems in the West 
- we need to stop treating every project like  
a blank slate. We need to build like the South 
Koreans—pragmatic, modular, and fast. Not because  
we’re in a rush, but because it’s so wasteful - 
constantly tripping over our own feet – and there  
is a huge cost associated with the time wasted 
on planned projects that are never completed.
 
This isn’t the situation everywhere however… We 
discussed in a recent video how in the 1990s and  
2000s, Madrid managed to triple the length 
of its metro system in just 12 years— and  
they made these upgrades faster and cheaper 
than almost any other city in the world.
 
In Madrid a 35-mile metro 
expansion cost around $2.8  
billion dollars which adjusted for inflation is 
about the same as New York’s one-and-a-half-mile  
extension of the 7 subway to Hudson Yard cost.
The paradox is this: the more we care about doing  
things right—environmentally, socially, 
politically, the less we seem able to  
do anything at all. Environmentalists oppose 
wind farms. Housing advocates block density.  
Governments outsource delivery but retain 
all the risk. The end result is paralysis.
 
Megaprojects like Xlinks are a symptom of this 
dysfunction: too big to fail, too complex to  
succeed. They promise to solve every problem - all 
at once—climate, cost, security—but then collapse  
under the weight of their own ambition.
There may be a better way, where instead of  
betting on unproven megaprojects, governments 
could focus on pragmatic, modular, and proven  
solutions to the problems faced by their citizens: 
things like grid upgrades, domestic renewables,  
interconnectors with redundancy, and public 
transport built to cost—not to impress.
 
Madrid’s metro, Singapore’s grid strategy, 
and Ireland’s Turlough Hill pumped-storage  
plant are all examples of infrastructure that 
works because it was designed with delivery in  
mind and where the key is speed, simplicity, 
and replicability—not scale and spectacle.
 
One of the most underappreciated risks of the 
Xlinks project was its reliance on a single,  
ultra-long subsea cable. Recent incidents 
have highlighted the vulnerability of  
undersea infrastructure: ships dragging anchors, 
fishing activity, and even suspected sabotage have  
all caused cable cuts in strategic areas 
like the Baltic Sea and around Taiwan.
 
These acts are increasingly being 
described as a form of 'gray zone  
warfare'—covert actions designed to weaken 
infrastructure with plausible deniability.  
The existence of a Chinese patent for a towed 
submarine cable-cutting device only adds to this  
concern. In this context, Xlinks begins to look 
less like a resilient energy solution and more  
like a fragile lifeline waiting to be severed.
The likelihood of the Xlinks project coming in on  
budget was extremely low, based on the various 
risk factors and on historical precedent.
 
First up, the project had already experienced 
significant cost escalation before construction  
even began. Initial estimates of £16 
billion pounds - ballooned to twenty  
billion pounds and then £24 billion—a 50% 
increase—mirroring the trajectory of other  
UK megaprojects like HS2 and Hinkley Point C.
Second, the scale and complexity of Xlinks were  
unprecedented. The 22.5 GWh battery array would 
have been 16 times larger than the world’s largest  
completed battery system, requiring over 5,700 
Battery Megapacks and occupying around 50 square  
miles. The four-thousand-kilometer subsea HVDC 
cable would have been the longest in the world,  
traversing deep-sea environments and multiple 
jurisdictions. No company involved had  
previously delivered a project of this scale.
Third, the project was exposed to geopolitical  
and regulatory risks. The cable’s route 
through international waters raised concerns  
about sabotage and jurisdictional disputes. 
The UK government ultimately cited security  
concerns and the lack of domestic supply chain 
benefits as reasons for withdrawing support.
 
Fourth, historical precedent suggests 
that megaprojects of this nature rarely  
stay on budget and the larger and more novel the 
project, the greater the likelihood of failure.
 
Finally, the analysis done by Common Sense 
Sceptic on a similar proposed project in the  
United States highlighted material constraints, 
storage inefficiencies, and transmission losses  
that would have plagued the project. The battery 
array alone would have required massive quantities  
of lithium and other materials, potentially 
beyond existing, known global supplies.
 
In short, Xlinks fit the profile of a project 
that promised too much, too soon—and would almost  
certainly have required additional public 
funding or scope reductions to survive.
 
The developed world doesn’t lack money or 
technology—it instead lacks institutional  
clarity and political courage. We need to shift 
from grandiosity to delivery, from spectacle  
to substance. If we want to decarbonize, house 
people, and modernize our economies, we don’t need  
more Xlinks. We need to remember how to build.
