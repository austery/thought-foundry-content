From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Friday,
 January
 23rd.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


After
 a
 highstakes,
 yearslong
 legal


saga,
 the
 Chinese
 company
 that
 owns
 Tik


Tok
 has
 struck
 a
 deal
 to
 create
 a
 new
 US


version
 of
 the
 social
 media
 app.
 Under


the
 agreement,
 the
 company
 Bite
 Dance


has
 brought
 in
 a
 group
 of
 non-Chinese


investors
 who
 will
 now
 help
 run
 the


platform
 for
 its
 200
 million
 plus


American
 users.
 Here
 are
 three
 things
 to


know
 about
 the
 deal.


First,
 why
 is
 there
 a
 deal
 at
 all?
 Back


in
 the
 pandemic,
 as
 the
 app
 surged
 in


popularity,
 US
 lawmakers
 started
 to


worry
 that
 it
 could
 be
 a
 national


security
 risk
 with
 the
 Chinese


government
 potentially
 able
 to
 access


personal
 information
 about
 Americans
 or


feed
 them
 propaganda.
 That
 eventually


led
 to
 a
 law
 that
 was
 supposed
 to
 have


banned
 Tik
 Tok
 if
 it
 didn't
 break
 off


from
 bite
 dance
 by
 early
 last
 year.
 But


President
 Trump
 delayed
 enforcement
 of


that
 law
 multiple
 times
 while
 he
 got


personally
 involved
 in
 putting
 together


a
 new
 arrangement
 of
 investors.
 So
 the


second
 thing
 to
 know
 who
 are
 those


investors?


Bite
 Dance
 is
 still
 actually
 the
 biggest


player
 owning
 about
 20%
 of
 the
 new


venture.
 Other
 leading
 stakeholders


include
 some
 major
 investment
 firms
 and


Oracle
 the
 cloud
 computing
 giant.


Several
 of
 those
 new
 owners
 have
 ties
 to


Trump,
 like
 Oracle's
 billionaire
 CEO


Larry
 Ellison,
 who's
 made
 frequent


visits
 to
 the
 White
 House.
 It
 is
 the


latest
 example
 of
 the
 Ellison
 family's


rapidly
 expanding
 influence
 over
 news


and
 entertainment
 in
 the
 US.
 At
 this


point,
 Larry
 and
 his
 son
 David
 control


Paramount,
 which
 includes
 CBS,
 and
 are


making
 a
 play
 for
 Warner
 Brothers


Discovery.


And
 the
 third
 thing,
 what
 does
 this
 all


mean
 for
 people
 who
 use
 Tik
 Tok?
 The


short
 answer,
 it
 is
 too
 early
 to
 tell.


You
 do
 not
 have
 to
 download
 a
 new
 app,


and
 Bite
 Dance
 will
 still
 be
 licensing


its
 powerful
 recommendation
 algorithm
 to


the
 American
 Tik
 Tok.
 But
 the
 new


ownership
 will
 have
 the
 power
 to


moderate
 content
 on
 the
 app,
 deciding


which
 videos
 to
 leave
 up
 or
 take
 down.


That's
 raised
 concerns
 among
 some


experts
 and
 Tik
 Tok
 users
 that
 the
 new


owners
 could
 try
 to
 influence
 what


people
 see,
 potentially
 showing
 more


posts
 aligned
 with
 the
 Trump


administration's
 views.


We
 are
 not
 going
 to
 shop.
 We
 are
 not


going
 to
 work.
 We
 are
 not
 going
 to


school
 on
 Friday,
 January
 23rd.
 Today
 in


Minnesota,


>> we
 are
 shut
 down
 all
 the
 business
 in


Mall
 24
 on
 Friday.


>> Hundreds
 of
 businesses
 are
 expected
 to


close
 across
 the
 state
 as
 part
 of
 a


general
 strike
 in
 protest
 of
 the
 Trump


administration's
 ramped
 up
 immigration


enforcement.


>> Don't
 show
 up
 to
 work.
 Don't
 spend
 no


kind
 of
 money.
 We
 ain't
 going
 to
 the


Mall
 of
 America.
 We're
 not
 going
 to
 no


Burger
 King.
 We
 ain't
 doing
 none
 of


that.


>> It
 comes
 as
 motans
 have
 been
 pushing


back
 for
 weeks
 on
 the
 surge
 of
 federal


agents
 there.
 The
 government
 has
 sent
 as


many
 as
 3,000
 and
 their
 operation
 has


led
 to
 thousands
 of
 arrests
 and
 at
 least


two
 shootings,
 including
 the
 killing
 of


Renee
 Good
 by
 an
 ICE
 officer.
 Local


officials
 have
 called
 the
 deployment
 an


invasion
 as
 agents
 have
 fanned
 out
 in


neighborhoods
 and
 used
 aggressive


tactics,
 breaking
 car
 windows
 and


deploying
 pepper
 spray
 in
 people's


faces.
 At
 one
 point,
 they
 dragged
 a
 man


who
 turned
 out
 to
 be
 a
 US
 citizen
 out
 of


his
 house
 in
 his
 underwear
 in
 the
 snow.


In
 another
 case
 that's
 gotten
 national


attention
 this
 week,
 they
 detained
 a


5-year-old
 boy
 as
 he
 was
 coming
 home


from
 prek
 with
 his
 dad.
 School
 officials


said
 he
 was
 the
 fourth
 child
 in
 the


district
 to
 be
 detained
 recently.


>> Good
 afternoon,
 everybody.
 How
 we
 doing?


>> With
 the
 state
 on
 edge,
 Vice
 President


J.
 D.
 Vance
 traveled
 to
 the
 Twin
 Cities


yesterday.
 I
 wanted
 to
 meet
 with


business
 leaders,
 with
 ICE
 officers,


with
 local
 law
 enforcement
 to
 try
 to


understand
 a
 little
 bit
 better
 what's


going
 on
 so
 that
 we
 can
 tone
 down
 the


temperature
 a
 little
 bit,
 reduce
 the


chaos,
 but
 still


>> Vance
 said
 that
 he
 thought
 federal


agents
 were
 doing
 a
 quote
 incredible


job,
 and
 that
 the
 unrest
 in
 the
 city
 was


the
 result
 of
 a
 failure
 of
 cooperation


by
 state
 and
 local
 officials.


In
 another
 update
 on
 the
 protests,
 the


Justice
 Department
 arrested
 three
 people


over
 a
 demonstration
 at
 a
 church
 in
 St.


Paul
 after
 they
 went
 there
 to
 demand


that
 one
 of
 the
 pastors
 resign,


believing
 he
 works
 for
 ICE.
 It's
 a
 rare


instance
 of
 the
 federal
 government


directing
 the
 arrests
 of
 nonviolent


protesters.
 President
 Trump
 wrote
 online


that
 he'd
 seen
 footage
 of
 them


interrupting
 the
 church
 service,
 saying,


quote,
 "They
 are
 troublemakers
 who


should
 be
 thrown
 in
 jail
 or
 thrown
 out


of
 the
 country."


The
 Justice
 Department
 also
 tried
 to


charge
 former
 CNN
 journalist
 Don
 Lemon,


who
 was
 at
 the
 scene
 reporting
 on
 it,


but
 sources
 tell
 the
 Times
 a
 federal


magistrate
 judge
 refused
 to
 approve
 that


criminal
 complaint.


Meanwhile,
 a
 new
 Time
 Sienna
 poll
 shows


that
 while
 roughly
 half
 of
 voters


support
 President
 Trump's
 deportations,


61%
 said
 ICE
 had
 gone
 quote
 too
 far
 in


their
 tactics.
 That
 includes
 nearly
 one


in
 five
 Republicans.


Well,
 we
 have
 waited
 for
 winter
 weather


and
 boy
 are
 we
 going
 to
 get
 it
 going


into
 this
 weekend.
 We
 are
 across
 the
 US.


>> Wintertorm
 watch
 is
 now
 up
 for
 a
 large


portion
 of
 North
 Texas.


>> People
 are
 bracing
 for
 a
 major
 winter


storm.


>> Road
 crews
 in
 Missouri
 are
 out
 preparing


for
 these
 storms.
 It
 could
 hit
 almost


half
 the
 country's
 population
 with
 a
 mix


of
 snow
 and
 sleet.


>> I
 am
 sure
 New
 York
 and
 our
 entire


corridor
 here
 is
 going
 to
 be
 next.


>> The
 storm
 is
 expected
 to
 get
 going
 this


afternoon
 in
 the
 Rockies
 before
 moving


east
 across
 the
 country
 over
 the


weekend.
 Meteorologists
 say
 some
 regions


could
 get
 a
 foot
 or
 more
 of
 snow
 and


after
 that
 an
 intense
 freeze.
 The
 wind


chill
 in
 North
 Dakota,
 for
 example,


could
 drop
 as
 low
 as
 -50°.


One
 meteorologist
 told
 the
 Times,
 "It's


going
 to
 be
 hazardous
 for
 humans
 to
 step


outside."
 Further
 south,
 the
 big
 concern


is
 freezing
 rain.
 State
 and
 local


officials
 are
 preparing
 for
 the


possibility
 of
 trees,
 power
 lines,
 and


roads
 being
 covered
 in
 heavy
 ice
 causing


travel
 delays.
 There's
 also
 concern


about
 the
 power
 grid.
 Experts
 are


drawing
 comparisons
 to
 another
 massive


winter
 storm
 in
 Texas
 5
 years
 ago
 that


led
 to
 extensive
 blackouts
 and
 left


around
 200
 people
 dead.


A
 new
 analysis
 of
 crime
 data
 from
 across


the
 country
 is
 pointing
 to
 a
 remarkable


milestone.
 2025
 will
 likely
 register
 as


having
 the
 lowest
 national
 homicide
 rate


in
 more
 than
 a
 century.
 According
 to
 the


nonpartisan
 Council
 on
 Criminal
 Justice,


which
 crunched
 the
 numbers,
 the
 drop
 is


part
 of
 an
 overall
 decrease
 in
 violent


crime
 that's
 been
 happening
 for
 years.


Apart
 from
 a
 temporary
 surge
 during
 the


pandemic,
 experts
 say
 there's
 no
 one


clear
 answer
 for
 why
 crime
 rates
 have


been
 falling,
 but
 they
 have
 a
 wide
 range


of
 educated
 guesses.
 Some
 point
 to
 the


phasing
 out
 of
 lead
 gasoline
 back
 in
 the


70s,
 which
 had
 impaired
 brain


development.
 Some
 other
 possible


factors,
 the
 growing
 use
 of
 surveillance


cameras,
 new
 policing
 techniques,
 more


programs
 that
 give
 teenagers
 summer


jobs,
 better
 mental
 health
 treatment,
 or


even
 the
 country's
 aging
 population.
 One


professor
 who
 studies
 crime
 told
 the


Times
 that
 changing
 habits
 like
 more


screen
 time
 could
 also
 be
 playing
 a


role,
 saying
 American
 society
 is
 quote


becoming
 much
 less
 face
 to
 face,
 which


is
 sort
 of
 a
 requirement
 for
 violence.


And
 finally,


>> you
 keep
 dancing
 with
 the
 devil.
 One
 day


he's
 going
 to
 follow
 you
 home.


>> The
 big
 wow
 out
 of
 the
 Oscar
 nominations


this
 year
 was
 that
 the
 vampire
 movie


Sinners
 broke
 the
 record
 for
 most


nominations
 ever,
 beating
 out
 the


previous
 three-way
 tie
 of
 Titanic,
 La
 La


Land,
 and
 All
 About
 Eve.


>> Thank
 you,
 SENSEI.
 THANK
 YOU.


REVOLUTION.


>> The
 movie
 One
 Battle
 After
 Another
 about


a
 scrappy
 crew
 rising
 up
 against


authoritarianism
 was
 close
 behind.
 Both


are
 the
 kind
 of
 movies
 Hollywood
 has


mostly
 stopped
 making.
 Big
 budget


original
 stories
 instead
 of
 sequels,


spin-offs,
 etc.
 In
 fact,
 the
 studio


executives
 who
 originally
 backed
 Sinners


and
 one
 battle
 after
 another
 were
 widely


expected
 to
 lose
 their
 jobs
 for
 taking


those
 swings.


The
 biggest
 snub
 in
 the
 nominations,


according
 to
 the
 Times
 pop
 culture


reporter
 Kyle
 Buchanan,
 is
 that
 the


Wicked
 sequel
 got
 none,
 zero,
 even
 after


the
 first
 installment
 got
 a
 bunch.
 And


one
 of
 the
 major
 h
 reallyies,
 according


to
 Kyle,


F1,
 the
 race
 car
 movie
 featuring
 Brad


Pitt
 driving
 real
 fast
 and
 taking
 his


shirt
 off,
 walked
 away
 with
 a
 best


picture
 nomination.


>> Did
 you
 win
 something?


>> Vroom
 vroom.
 The
 Oscar
 ceremony
 will
 be


March
 15th.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.

Now,
 time
 for
 the
 quiz.
 We've
 got
 a
 few


questions
 for
 you
 about
 stories
 the


Times
 has
 been
 covering.
 Here
 we
 go.


First
 up,


>> in
 Greenland
 and
 Denmark,
 President


Trump's
 recent
 threats
 to
 seize
 the


Arctic
 Island
 sparked
 protests.
 Some
 of


the
 people
 out
 on
 the
 streets
 wore
 red


hats
 that
 look
 like
 the
 ones
 Trump
 made


famous,
 and
 they
 do
 have
 the
 same
 MAGA


initials,
 but
 in
 this
 case,
 M
 A
 stands


for
 something
 else.
 Your
 question,
 what


do
 the
 hats
 say?


A
 hint,
 it's
 make
 America


what


the
 answer,
 make
 America
 go
 away.


>> When
 we
 made
 it,
 funny
 enough,
 we
 sold


maybe
 five
 and
 we
 g
 I
 gave
 a
 lot
 of
 way


to
 friends
 and
 so
 on
 and
 they
 say,
 "Ah,


that's
 funny."
 The
 man
 who
 designed
 the


hats
 told
 the
 Associated
 Press
 he
 first


made
 a
 batch
 last
 year,
 but
 they
 weren't


really
 a
 bestseller
 until
 recently
 when


Trump
 amped
 up
 his
 threats.
 Now,
 the


designer
 is
 trying
 to
 keep
 up
 with
 a
 new


flood
 of
 online
 orders.


Next
 question.
 In
 the
 past
 few
 years,
 as


GLP1
 drugs
 like
 Ompic
 have
 become
 more


and
 more
 popular,
 they've
 had
 unexpected


side
 effects
 for
 American
 businesses.


Junk
 food
 companies
 are
 scrambling
 as


people
 crave
 less
 processed
 food,
 and


some
 wedding
 dress
 designers
 are
 seeing


a
 surge
 in
 customers
 asking
 for


lastminute
 alterations
 after
 losing


weight.
 Now,
 a
 new
 report
 says
 that
 one


industry
 in
 particular
 could
 potentially


save
 hundreds
 of
 millions
 of
 dollars


thanks
 to
 the
 drugs.
 What
 industry
 is


it?


A
 hint,
 you
 might
 say
 these
 American


companies
 are
 united
 on
 trying
 to
 cut


costs.


The
 answer,
 the
 US
 airline
 industry.


According
 to
 the
 study
 by
 a
 financial


services
 firm,
 the
 country's
 four


biggest
 airlines,
 including
 American
 and


United,
 could
 save
 as
 much
 as
 580


million
 a
 year
 on
 fuel
 because
 of


lighter
 passengers.


Quick
 bonus
 question.
 Roughly
 what


percentage
 of
 Americans
 say
 they
 have


taken
 a
 GLP-1
 drug?


The
 answer


about
 20%.


And
 last
 question,
 the
 iconic
 fashion


designer
 Valentino
 died
 this
 week.
 Over


his
 decades
 long
 career,
 he
 dressed
 some


of
 the
 most
 famous
 women
 in
 the
 world.


The
 mayor
 of
 Rome
 once
 said
 about
 him.


In
 Italy,
 there
 is
 the
 Pope
 and
 there
 is


Valentino.
 I've
 got
 a
 few
 questions
 for


you
 about
 some
 of
 his
 big
 fashion


moments.
 See
 if
 you
 can
 name
 whose


dresses
 he
 designed.
 This
 dress
 is


something
 very
 very
 important
 in
 my


life.
 She
 make
 me
 famous
 in
 United


States.


>> This
 former
 first
 lady
 wore
 a
 cream
 lace


Valentino
 dress
 when
 she
 got
 married


again
 in
 1968.


Next
 one.


>> This
 red
 dress.
 She's
 actually
 wearing
 a


red
 tight.
 I
 mean
 seriously,
 this
 is


incredible.
 Head
 toe
 burgundy.
 Burgundy.


This
 style
 icon
 famously
 wore
 one
 of
 his


designs
 in
 1992
 amid
 a
 very
 public


separation
 from
 her
 husband.
 And
 it
 did


not
 exactly
 adhere
 to
 a
 traditional


royal
 dress
 code.
 And


>> and
 the
 Oscar
 goes
 to


>> when
 this
 actress
 won
 her
 first
 ever


Oscar
 in
 2001,
 she
 was
 wearing
 a
 black


and
 white
 Valentino.


>> So
 I
 thank
 you
 for
 really
 making
 me
 feel


so


I
 love
 it
 up
 here.


So
 that
 was
 in
 order
 a
 first
 lady,
 a


style
 icon
 bucking
 traditional
 royal


dress,
 and
 the
 actress
 who
 took
 home
 the


trophy
 for,
 and
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 big


hint,
 playing
 Aaron
 Brochovich.


The
 answers,
 Jackie
 Onasses
 in
 the


wedding
 dress,
 Princess
 Diana
 in
 a


kneelength
 burgundy
 number,
 and
 Julia


Roberts
 celebrating
 her
 big
 win.


I'll
 just
 leave
 you
 here
 with
 my


personal
 favorite
 Valentino
 fact
 that
 I


learned.
 Apparently,
 when
 he
 traveled,


he
 regularly
 brought
 five
 of
 his
 beloved


pugs
 along
 with
 him
 on
 his
 private
 jet.


And
 when
 he
 got
 to
 his
 destination,


there
 would
 be
 a
 car
 in
 his
 motorcade


specifically
 for
 the
 pugs.


That's
 it
 for

 news
 quiz.
