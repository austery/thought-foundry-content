From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Thursday,
 February
 19th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


The
 Times
 has
 learned
 that
 the
 Trump


administration's
 rapid
 buildup
 of
 US


forces
 in
 the
 Middle
 East
 has
 reached


the
 point
 that
 President
 Trump
 has
 the


option
 to
 strike
 Iran
 as
 soon
 as
 this


weekend.
 He's
 given
 no
 indication
 that


he
 will,
 but
 he's
 repeatedly
 threatened


action
 if
 Iran
 doesn't
 end
 its
 nuclear


program.
 That
 could
 be
 a
 repeat
 of
 June


when
 the
 US
 joined
 with
 Israel
 to
 strike


Iranian
 military
 and
 nuclear
 facilities.


>> Can
 you
 share
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 the


president's
 thinking
 on
 whether
 or
 not


to
 strike
 Iran,
 who
 he's
 talking
 to,
 and


why
 a
 strike
 might
 be
 necessary
 on
 a


nuclear
 program
 he
 says
 was
 obliterated


by
 the
 last
 US
 strike.
 Well,
 there's


many
 reasons
 and
 arguments
 that
 one


could
 make
 uh
 for
 a
 strike
 against
 Iran.


Uh


>> while
 the
 Trump
 administration
 has


repeatedly
 said
 the
 June
 strikes


destroyed
 Iran's
 nuclear
 program,


experts
 say
 the
 damage
 was
 not
 complete


and
 the
 country's
 been
 rebuilding.
 There


were
 talks
 this
 week
 between
 the
 US
 and


Iranian
 officials.
 And
 yesterday,
 White


House
 press
 secretary
 Caroline
 Levitt


said
 Trump's
 preference
 is
 still
 a


diplomatic
 resolution.
 Though
 with


respect
 to
 Iran
 or
 any
 country
 around


the
 world,
 diplomacy
 is
 always
 his
 first


option
 and
 Iran
 would
 be
 very
 wise
 to


make
 a
 deal
 with
 President
 Trump
 and


with
 this
 administration.


>> As
 the
 negotiations
 continue,
 the
 region


is
 going
 on
 high
 alert.
 Israeli
 forces


have
 been
 making
 preparations
 for


another
 potential
 joint
 strike
 with
 the


US
 and
 America's
 firepower
 in
 the
 Middle


East
 keeps
 growing.
 There
 are
 now
 13


Navy
 destroyers
 there,
 dozens
 of
 attack


aircraft,
 and
 a
 second
 aircraft
 carrier


is
 on
 the
 way.
 The
 Pentagon
 has
 also


dispatched
 more
 air
 defense
 systems
 to


help
 protect
 the
 roughly
 30
 to
 40,000
 US


troops
 in
 the
 region.
 While
 Trump


campaigned
 for
 his
 second
 term
 in


office,
 promising
 to
 keep
 the
 US
 out
 of


wars,
 any
 strike
 on
 Iran,
 if
 it
 were
 to


happen,
 would
 be
 at
 least
 the
 seventh


American
 military
 attack
 on
 another


country
 in
 the
 past
 year.


Inside
 the
 Pentagon,
 there's
 been
 an


unusual
 fight
 taking
 place
 between
 the


Defense
 Department
 and
 Anthropic,
 one
 of


the
 country's
 biggest
 AI
 companies.
 At


the
 heart
 of
 it
 is
 the
 question
 of
 how


AI
 should
 or
 should
 not
 be
 used
 by
 the


military.
 The
 DoD
 works
 with
 a
 lot
 of


tech
 giants,
 Anthropic,
 Google,
 OpenAI,


and
 Elon
 Musk's
 XAI.
 Last
 month,
 Defense


Secretary
 Pete
 Hegsth
 put
 out
 a
 memo


calling
 on
 those
 companies
 to
 remove


restrictions
 on
 their
 AI
 technology.


Anthropic
 said,
 "Hold
 on."
 According
 to


two
 people
 involved
 in
 the
 discussions,


the
 company
 told
 defense
 officials
 it


does
 not
 want
 its
 AI
 used
 for
 mass


surveillance
 of
 Americans
 or
 to
 be


deployed
 in
 autonomous
 weapons
 that


could
 fire
 with
 no
 humans
 involved.
 It


wanted
 to
 renegotiate
 its
 contract.
 That


angered
 Hegsth
 and
 others
 in
 the


Pentagon,
 according
 to
 current
 and


former
 officials.
 This
 week,
 the
 fight


broke
 into
 the
 open
 when
 Axios
 reported


the
 Pentagon
 was
 close
 to
 declaring


anthropic,
 quote,
 a
 supply
 chain
 risk,
 a


rare
 designation
 that
 would
 sever
 ties


between
 the
 company
 and
 the
 US
 military.


If
 it
 happens,
 it
 will
 be
 a
 significant


break.
 Anthropic
 tech
 is
 widely


integrated
 across
 the
 DoD,
 including
 in


classified
 systems.
 The
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 reported
 the
 company's
 tech
 was


used
 in
 the
 US
 operation
 in
 Venezuela
 to


capture
 Nicholas
 Maduro.
 In
 a
 statement,


a
 Pentagon
 spokesman
 said
 the


department's
 relationship
 with
 Anthropic


was
 being
 reviewed
 and
 quote,
 "Our


nation
 requires
 that
 our
 partners
 be


willing
 to
 help
 our
 war
 fighters
 win
 in


any
 fight."
 Anthropic,
 for
 its
 part,


said
 it
 was
 having
 goodfaith


conversations
 with
 the
 government
 on
 how


to
 quote
 get
 these
 complex
 issues
 right.


According
 to
 the
 BBC,
 police
 in
 Britain


have
 arrested
 Andrew
 Mountbatton


Windsor,
 formerly
 known
 as
 Prince


Andrew,
 over
 suspicions
 that
 he
 shared


confidential
 information
 with
 Jeffrey


Epstein.
 A
 police
 statement
 did
 not
 name


the
 suspect
 they'd
 arrested,
 as
 is


normal
 under
 British
 law,
 but
 the


details
 match
 what's
 publicly
 known


about
 the
 allegations
 against
 him.


Andrew's
 connections
 to
 Epstein
 have


been
 well
 documented
 for
 years.


Virginia,
 one
 of
 Epste's
 victims,
 has


said
 she
 was
 trafficked
 to
 Andrew
 when


she
 was
 a
 teenager
 and
 that
 he
 had
 sex


with
 her
 multiple
 times,
 an
 allegation


he's
 denied.
 Recently,
 Andrew
 has
 faced


a
 growing
 number
 of
 consequences
 for
 his


conduct.
 including
 being
 stripped
 of
 his


royal
 titles.
 This
 investigation
 though


opens
 a
 new
 chapter.
 In
 the
 most
 recent


trunch
 of
 documents
 released
 by
 the


Justice
 Department
 related
 to
 its


Epstein
 investigation,
 there
 were
 a


number
 of
 emails
 that
 suggested
 Andrew


may
 have
 shared
 confidential
 documents


when
 he
 was
 working
 as
 a
 British
 trade


envoy.
 In
 a
 statement
 from
 earlier
 this


month,
 Buckingham
 Palace
 has
 said
 that


King
 Charles,
 Andrew's
 brother,
 has
 been


clear
 about
 his
 quote,
 profound
 concern


at
 allegations
 which
 continue
 to
 come
 to


light.


In
 South
 Korea
 just
 over
 a
 year
 ago,
 the


country's
 president
 Yunukul
 stunned
 the


nation
 and
 the
 world
 by
 going
 on
 TV
 to


declare
 martial
 law,
 claiming
 his


political
 opponents
 were
 anti-state


forces.


That
 night,
 Yun
 banned
 all
 political


activities
 and
 placed
 the
 news
 media


under
 military
 control.
 Military


helicopters
 landed
 at
 the
 National


Assembly
 with
 troops
 moving
 to
 take
 over


the
 legislature.


Almost
 immediately,
 South
 Koreans
 rushed


to
 the
 building
 to
 confront
 the
 troops,


buying
 lawmakers
 time
 to
 vote
 down
 the


president's
 martial
 law
 decree.
 Yun
 was


eventually
 impeached
 and
 charged
 with


leading
 an
 insurrection.
 This
 morning,


he
 was
 found
 guilty
 and
 sentenced
 to


life
 in
 prison.
 Prosecutors
 had
 been


pushing
 for
 the
 death
 penalty.
 In
 his


verdict,
 the
 judge
 overseeing
 the
 case


said
 what
 Yun
 did
 amounted
 to
 a
 riot


that
 caused
 profound
 damage
 to
 South


Korean
 society
 and
 supercharged


political
 polarization.
 Over
 the
 last


year,
 thousands
 of
 Yun
 supporters
 have


held
 frequent
 rallies
 and
 formed
 the


core
 of
 a
 new
 far-right
 political


movement
 in
 the
 country.
 They
 promote
 a


conspiracy
 theory
 claiming
 that
 South


Korean
 elections
 have
 been
 manipulated


by
 foreigners
 and
 they've
 used
 the


American
 flag
 as
 a
 symbol
 for
 their


cause
 along
 with
 the
 slogan
 make
 Korea


great
 again.
 Yun,
 who
 has
 one
 week
 to


appeal
 the
 ruling,
 is
 the
 fifth
 South


Korean
 president
 to
 face
 criminal


charges
 since
 the
 country
 transitioned


from
 authoritarian
 rule
 to
 a
 democracy


in
 the
 1980s.


Extreme


weather
 conditions
 I
 would
 I
 would
 say


is
 an
 understatement.
 Uh
 lots
 of
 snow,


gale
 force
 winds
 making
 it
 impossible
 to


see.
 So
 it
 was


>> officials
 in
 California
 yesterday


provided
 new
 details
 about
 what's
 become


the
 deadliest
 avalanche
 disaster
 in
 the


US
 in
 almost
 50
 years.


>> Day
 that
 they
 were
 coming
 out
 of
 the
 the


back
 country,
 coming
 back
 to
 the
 trail


head
 when
 the
 avalanche
 occurred.
 The


sheriff
 of
 Nevada
 County
 described
 how


the
 group
 of
 skiers
 accompanied
 by
 tour


guides
 was
 just
 finishing
 up
 their
 3-day


trip
 when
 they
 were
 hit
 by
 a
 wall
 of


snow.
 Eight
 skiers
 were
 killed
 and
 one


member
 of
 the
 group
 remains
 missing,


presumed
 dead.
 Because
 of
 the
 hazardous


conditions,
 the
 bodies
 have
 not
 been


brought
 down
 from
 the
 site
 yet.
 Law


enforcement
 also
 described
 how
 a
 feature


available
 on
 many
 iPhones
 helped
 the


surviving
 skiers
 communicate
 with
 first


responders
 after
 the
 disaster
 so
 they


could
 be
 rescued.
 The
 emergency
 SOS


feature
 on
 the
 phones
 allows
 users
 to


text
 emergency
 services
 even
 if
 they


don't
 have
 cell
 service
 or
 Wi-Fi.
 It


uses
 a
 satellite
 connection
 instead.


Apple
 says
 that
 to
 get
 the
 best


connection
 in
 an
 emergency,
 the
 user


should
 be
 outside
 with
 a
 clear
 view
 of


the
 sky
 and
 horizon.


And
 finally,
 Russia's
 longstanding


sports
 exile
 is
 coming
 to
 an
 end.
 The


organizers
 of
 the
 2026
 Parolympic
 Games,


which
 start
 in
 Italy
 next
 month
 after


the
 Olympics
 wrap
 up,
 have
 confirmed


that
 Russia
 will
 be
 represented
 by
 a


small
 team
 of
 athletes.
 It
 will
 be
 the


first
 time
 that
 the
 Russian
 flag
 and


anthem
 will
 appear
 at
 the
 game
 since


2014.


Russia's
 global
 sports
 banishment


started
 as
 a
 response
 to
 revelations


about
 the
 country's
 sprawling
 state


sanctioned
 doping
 scheme.
 It
 then


deepened
 after
 the
 country
 invaded


Ukraine
 in
 2022.


This
 week's
 reversal
 was
 immediately
 met


with
 anger
 and
 criticism
 from
 Ukraine


and
 its
 European
 allies.
 The
 European


Commission's
 representative
 for
 sports


said
 he
 would
 boycott
 the
 Parolympics


opening
 ceremony
 in
 protest
 and
 Ukraine


said
 its
 officials
 wouldn't
 attend
 any


of
 the
 events.
 Still,
 attitudes
 toward


Russia's
 participation
 have
 been


softening
 among
 some
 global
 sports


leaders.
 The
 president
 of
 FIFA
 has
 said


he
 would
 like
 to
 see
 Russia
 return
 to


soccer's
 international
 competitions.
 And


the
 head
 of
 the
 International
 Olympic


Committee
 said
 this
 month
 that
 sports


must
 be
 a
 quote
 neutral
 ground
 separate


from
 politics,
 potentially
 paving
 the


way
 for
 Russia
 to
 compete
 at
 the
 2028


Olympic
 Games
 in
 Los
 Angeles.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.

Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
