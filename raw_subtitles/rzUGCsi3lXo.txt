Dr.
 Paul
 Kurtak
 is
 a
 psychiatrist
 and


scientist
 at
 the
 Center
 for
 Addiction


and
 Mental
 Health
 in
 Toronto
 and
 a


senior
 scientist
 and
 lead
 of
 the
 mental


health
 and
 addictions
 research
 program


at
 ICE
 and
 he
 joins
 us
 in
 studio.
 How


are
 you
 sir?


>> Great.
 Thanks
 for
 having
 me.


>> All
 right.
 Your
 study
 measured
 the


incidence
 of
 psychotic
 disorders
 across


different
 groups
 in
 Ontario.
 when
 you


stepped
 back
 and
 looked
 at
 the
 findings,


what
 surprised
 you
 the
 most?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 the
 the
 first
 thing
 that


surprised
 me
 uh
 and
 I
 should
 say
 at
 the


beginning
 that
 I
 was
 a
 co-author
 on
 this


study.
 Um
 it
 was
 led
 by
 a
 colleague
 of


mine
 at
 University
 of
 Ottawa,
 Dr.
 Daniel


Myin
 did
 a
 great
 job
 on
 this
 project.


When
 we
 looked
 at
 the
 findings,
 the


there
 are
 a
 couple
 things
 that
 struck


out.
 one
 is
 that
 um
 that
 that
 the


incidence
 which
 means
 the
 the
 rate
 of


new
 newly
 diagnosed
 individuals
 is


increasing
 over
 time.


>> Uh
 it
 is
 happening
 in
 younger


individuals
 over
 time.
 And
 then
 the


third
 piece
 is
 the
 the
 the
 way
 that
 the


diagnosis
 are
 breaking
 out.
 Uh,
 so
 there


are
 different
 types
 of
 diagnoses
 that


that
 are
 part
 of
 of
 what
 we
 call


psychotic
 disorders
 and
 and
 that's
 a
 bit


of
 a
 nuanced
 aspect
 of
 the
 study,
 but


that
 was
 a
 third
 piece
 that
 was
 kind
 of


interesting
 to
 us.


>> All right.
 Well,
 let's
 let's
 pick
 up
 on


that.
 When
 you
 say
 psychotic
 disorders,


what
 do
 we
 mean?
 We
 have
 schizophrenia


in
 one
 room,
 an
 umbrella
 term
 perhaps,


and
 then
 we
 have
 schizophrenia
 and
 we


have
 psychosis.
 Help
 us
 understand
 uh


sort
 of
 the
 terms
 there.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 there's
 schizophrenia
 and


schizopeeffective
 disorders
 and
 for


people
 to
 be
 diagnosed
 with
 those
 uh


conditions
 they
 they
 need
 to
 meet


certain
 criteria
 and
 and
 that
 uh
 the
 the


incident
 rate
 for
 those
 diagnoses
 did


have
 increased
 a
 little
 bit
 but
 not
 that


much.
 The
 the
 one
 that's
 increased
 more


so
 is
 called
 psychosis
 not
 otherwise


specified.
 And
 this
 is
 a
 diagnosis
 that


clinicians
 like
 myself
 use
 when
 somebody


is
 clearly
 presenting
 with
 prominent


psychotic
 symptoms
 like
 a
 deviation
 from


reality.


>> Sorry,
 hallucinations,


>> delusions.
 Exactly.
 And
 uh
 but
 but
 they


but
 there
 are
 other
 issues
 that
 prevent


us
 from
 saying
 it
 is
 clearly


schizophrenia
 and
 schizoeffective


disorder.
 So,
 we
 know
 that
 the
 person's


psychotic,
 but
 there
 could
 be
 other


factors
 that
 that
 may
 ultimately
 be


contributing
 to
 it.
 Um,
 like
 it
 could
 be


related
 to
 substance
 use,
 it
 could
 be


related
 to
 medical
 conditions,
 etc.,


etc.
 So,
 so
 it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 hedge


diagnosis.
 It
 is
 definitely
 a
 psychotic


disorder


>> and
 most
 individuals
 with
 this
 diagnosis


do
 over
 time
 evolve
 to
 developing
 a


diagnosis
 schizophrenia.
 just
 bel
 it
 it


suggests
 a
 level
 of
 uncertainty
 that
 is


truly
 schizophrenia
 at
 the
 time
 of
 first


diagnosis.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 simplify
 it


but
 fair
 to
 say
 like
 you
 like
 you


mentioned
 the
 specific
 set
 of
 symptoms


one
 of
 them
 is
 it's
 chronic
 with


schizophrenia
 that
 is
 longterm
 that's


about
 usually
 six
 months
 or
 more


>> correct


>> okay
 all
 right
 I
 want
 to
 look
 at
 a
 graph


uh
 from
 this
 study
 this
 graph
 shows
 the


incidence
 rate
 ratios
 for
 schizophrenia


spectrum
 disorder
 which
 is
 in
 the
 dark


blue
 color


>> psychosis
 not
 otherwise
 specified
 in


green
 and
 psychotic
 disorders
 which


include
 both
 schizophrenia
 and
 psychosis


in
 black.
 Now
 for
 each
 cohort
 studied,


this
 is
 comparing
 to
 the
 1975


1979


cohort.
 For
 psychotic
 disorders,
 the


black
 line,
 there
 is
 a
 gradual
 increase


in
 the
 rate
 of
 diagnosis
 starting
 with


those
 born
 in
 the
 198589
 cohort.
 When


researchers
 separated
 the
 data,
 it


showed
 that
 the
 rate
 of
 schizophrenia


goes
 up
 slightly
 but
 then
 starts
 to
 go


down,
 but
 the
 rate
 of
 psychosis


increases
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 ski
 hill.
 What


is
 this
 telling
 us?


>> Yes.
 So,
 so
 if
 we
 return
 to
 the


difference
 between
 psychosis
 not


otherwise
 specified
 and
 and
 uh
 the


something
 that
 is
 like
 truly
 a


schizophrenia
 spectrum
 disorder.


>> Uh
 it
 is
 the
 the
 the
 market
 increase
 in


in
 the
 sort
 of
 the
 slightly
 uncertain


category.
 the
 psychosis
 not
 otherwise


specified
 which
 means
 that


>> uh
 at
 the
 time
 of
 first
 diagnosis
 there


is
 is
 less
 certainty
 that
 this
 is
 truly


schizophrenia
 which
 means
 that
 there
 are


there's
 complexities
 in
 in
 in


the
 diagnosis
 over
 time
 that
 is


increasing
 the
 most


>> a
 lot
 of
 headlines
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 is


causing
 it
 this
 study
 was
 not
 looking
 at


what
 was
 causing
 this
 uh
 but
 help
 us


understand
 what
 what
 are
 what
 are
 some


links
 that
 have
 been
 sort
 of
 made


>> yeah
 so
 I
 think
 the
 the
 The
 first


important
 point
 is
 that
 this
 study
 was


very
 well
 designed
 to
 characterize


changes
 in
 rates
 over
 time.
 There's


nothing
 about
 this
 particular
 study
 that


helps
 us
 understand
 why
 we're
 observing


what
 we're
 observing.
 So
 when
 I
 think


about
 the
 links,
 it's
 really
 like


extrapolating
 to
 evidence
 beyond
 this


study.
 Um
 but
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 what
 we
 are


observing
 generally
 amongst
 young
 people


and
 these
 are
 16
 to
 35
 year old


individuals
 typically
 uh
 what
 we're


observing
 amongst
 young
 people
 is
 they


are
 far
 less
 stigmatized
 than
 previous


generations
 and
 much
 more
 inclined
 to


seek
 help.
 So
 that
 may
 partly
 explain


why
 we're
 seeing
 more
 and
 younger.
 Um


the
 other
 factor
 is
 that
 uh
 over
 time


there
 has
 been
 more
 robust
 um


implementation
 of
 early
 psychosis


intervention
 programs
 proincially.


>> Okay.


>> So
 anytime
 you
 put
 more
 services
 into
 a


province
 it
 that
 there's
 a
 tendency
 to


pull
 in
 more
 more
 cases.
 And
 then
 the


third
 piece
 that
 that
 actually
 is
 the


cause
 for
 concern
 is
 is
 the
 um
 is
 the


fact
 that
 the
 rise
 in
 the
 less
 certain


diagnosis
 the
 not
 otherwise
 specified
 is


is
 occurring
 dramatically
 at
 a
 time
 of


uh
 cannabis
 legalization.
 And
 and
 what


comes
 with
 cannabis
 legalization
 is
 the


young
 people
 are
 exposed
 with
 high


potency
 uh
 cannabis
 which
 uh
 evidence


outside
 of
 this
 study
 suggests
 does
 pose


a
 serious
 risk
 for
 the
 onset
 of


psychosis.


>> What
 does
 cannabis
 high
 high
 potency
 or


not?
 Uh
 these
 are
 young
 brains
 that


we're
 talking
 about.
 We're
 talking
 um


you
 know
 when
 they're
 still
 developing


up
 until
 about
 the
 age
 of
 25.
 But
 what


what
 does
 it
 do
 to
 the
 brain?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 so
 there's
 lot
 So,
 it's
 not


entirely
 clear,
 but
 that
 does
 seem
 to
 uh


like
 there's
 a
 there's
 a
 aggregation
 of


evidence
 that
 suggests
 that
 there's


something
 about
 uh
 the
 THC
 chemical
 in


cannabis
 that
 binds
 with
 certain


receptors
 in
 the
 brain
 that
 causes
 a


biological
 inclination
 to
 become


psychotic.
 So
 the
 way
 I
 think
 about
 it


and
 there
 are
 there
 are
 people
 who
 are


more
 better
 experts
 than
 me
 on
 this
 is
 I


think
 like
 if
 you
 are
 vulnerable
 to


developing
 a
 psychotic
 disorder,


exposure
 to
 high
 potency
 cannabis
 may


increase
 your
 likelihood
 to
 develop
 a


psychotic
 disorder.


>> Okay.
 Um
 is
 there
 a
 difference
 between


uh
 men
 and
 women?


>> There's
 there's
 been
 a
 a
 baseline


difference
 in
 men
 and
 women
 in
 the
 onset


of
 of
 schizophrenia.
 So
 men
 develop
 it


uh
 psychosis
 at
 a
 younger
 age.
 They
 tend


to
 be
 more
 disabled
 as
 a
 result
 of
 the


condition.
 Uh
 the
 ratio
 of
 men
 to
 women


is
 a
 little
 higher
 in
 men.
 And
 of
 course


uh
 as
 it
 relates
 to
 the
 cannabis
 risk


factor
 uh
 and
 actually
 to
 the
 service


utilization.
 Men,
 young
 men
 are


notoriously
 difficult
 to
 engage
 in


healthcare.
 Uh
 and
 they
 are
 much
 more


likely
 to
 consume
 substances
 than
 women.


uh
 we
 talked
 about
 legalization
 of


course
 2018
 um
 looking
 at
 this
 data
 and


of
 course
 this
 is
 just
 just
 the


beginning
 here
 was
 that
 the
 right
 call


>> yeah
 so
 so
 uh
 it's
 it's
 an
 important


question
 um
 the


policy
 is
 inherently
 a
 compromise
 and
 I


think
 that
 the
 the
 legalization
 issue
 in


2018
 responded
 to
 a
 couple
 of
 important


issues
 one
 is
 that
 that
 I
 mean,
 if
 you


walk
 around
 Toronto,
 there's
 clearly
 a
 a


public
 interest
 in
 having
 ready
 access


to
 marijuana
 recreationally.
 I
 mean,


that
 that
 is
 just
 what
 what
 people
 want


and
 so
 policy
 follows
 what
 what
 people


want
 typically.
 I
 also
 think,
 and
 this


is
 a
 really
 important
 piece,
 is
 that
 um


when
 cannabis
 was
 illegal,
 uh
 the
 the


consequences
 of
 it
 being
 illegal,


incarceration
 for
 possession
 did
 not


happen
 equitably.
 and
 that
 we
 know
 we


knew
 and
 that
 more
 marginalized


individuals
 were
 more
 likely
 to
 be


incarcerated
 and
 have
 all
 the
 negative


consequences
 of
 having
 a
 criminal
 record


etc.


>> uh
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that.
 So,
 so
 that
 was


a
 very
 good
 legitimate
 reason
 to
 enact


the
 policy.
 But
 now
 as
 more
 evidence


emerges
 like
 this
 is
 what
 we
 want
 to
 be


able
 to
 do,
 right?
 Monitor
 unintended


consequences
 of
 policy.
 So
 now
 what
 do


we
 do?
 and
 and and
 to
 me
 like
 uh


tobacco
 is
 probably
 a
 better
 example


than
 alcohol.


>> Tobacco
 is
 a
 legal
 substance,
 but
 it's


pretty
 highly
 regulated
 and
 highly


taxed.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 there
 are


policy
 solutions
 to
 to
 find
 that


compromise
 or
 balance
 between,


you
 know,
 maintaining
 the
 benefits
 for


which
 the
 policy
 was
 first
 enacted
 at


the
 same
 time
 address
 some
 of
 the
 risks


that
 we're
 learning
 about.


>> All right.
 receiving
 this
 kind
 of


diagnosis
 uh
 can
 be
 frightening
 for


many.
 Um
 could
 you
 explain
 how
 this


diagnosis
 is
 challenging
 for
 the
 indivi


individual
 or
 for
 those
 who
 are
 in
 their


lives
 as
 well?


>> Oh,
 this
 is
 you
 know
 my
 my
 clinical
 work


is
 in
 the
 CAMH
 emergency
 department
 and


this
 is
 this
 is
 one
 of
 those
 ones
 where


you
 uh
 you
 really
 feel
 for
 the


individual.
 Uh
 so
 how
 it
 manifests
 um
 it


typically
 it
 is
 a
 it
 often
 a
 slowly


evolving
 sort
 of
 uh
 deviation
 from


reality
 and
 also
 often
 uh
 a
 slowly


evolving
 uh
 social
 withdrawal
 that
 that


uh
 so
 a
 young
 man
 uh
 in
 high
 school
 like


totally
 social
 engaged
 in
 everything


starts
 to
 withdraw
 from
 stuff


>> then
 starts
 like
 like
 avoiding
 school,


reluctant
 to
 avoid
 school,
 family
 starts


noticing
 that
 that
 he
 might
 be
 sort
 of


talking
 to
 himself,
 laughing


inappropriately
 at
 times.
 Um,
 so
 that's


kind
 of
 how
 it
 it it
 manifests.
 Um,
 and


and
 it's
 incredibly
 important
 that


individuals
 uh
 have
 access
 to
 care
 early


because
 we
 know
 that
 the
 longer
 an


individual
 goes
 untreated,
 the
 worse
 the


prognosis
 uh
 is.
 like
 like
 if
 we
 can
 get


people
 into
 care
 early
 the
 we
 can
 really


change
 the
 trajectory
 of
 a
 young


person's
 life.


>> I
 think
 I
 know
 the
 answer
 to
 this
 but


are
 there
 enough
 supports
 uh
 in
 place


for
 those
 seeking
 treatment?


>> So
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 that
 um
 throughout
 our


province
 we
 know
 that
 we
 don't
 have


enough
 services
 uh
 for
 individuals


struggling
 with
 mental
 illnesses


generally.
 In
 this
 case,
 we
 do
 have
 a
 in


comparison
 [clears throat]
 to
 other


areas
 of
 our
 mental
 health
 system,
 we
 do


have
 a
 robust
 system
 of
 early
 psychosis


intervention
 programs
 that
 currently


exist.
 Um,
 but
 evidence
 that
 has
 come


out
 of
 uh
 my
 research
 team
 suggests
 that


even
 though
 this
 provincial
 network


exists,
 um
 not
 not
 everybody
 with
 the


disorder
 can
 can
 can
 or
 does
 access


them.
 And
 and
 some
 of
 that
 has
 to
 do


with
 inadequacy
 of
 resources.
 Some
 of
 it


has
 to
 do
 with
 awareness.
 And
 so,
 for


example,
 if
 you're
 diagnosed
 by
 a


psychiatrist
 or
 diagnosed
 in
 a
 hospital


setting,
 you're
 much
 more
 likely
 to
 be


referred
 to
 one
 of
 these
 programs,


excuse
 [clears throat]
 me,
 than
 if
 you


were
 managed
 in
 primary
 care.
 And
 that's


probably
 just
 an
 awareness
 situation.
 Um


[clears throat]
 and
 and
 the
 the
 that's
 a


big
 problem
 because


uh
 what
 we
 know
 about
 the
 consequences


in
 addition
 to
 like
 you
 know
 longer


periods
 of
 no
 treatment
 uh
 this
 is
 a


deadly
 illness
 that
 that
 um
 you
 know


people
 who
 are
 diagnosed
 in
 a
 hospital


these
 are
 16
 to
 35
 year olds
 uh
 one
 in


25
 die
 within
 5
 years.
 If
 you're


diagnosed
 in
 outpatient
 setting
 one
 in


40
 nobody
 should
 be
 dying
 between
 the


ages
 of
 16
 and
 35.
 And


>> how
 do
 they
 how
 do
 they
 die?
 The
 most


common
 cause
 is
 suicide.


>> Okay.


>> Yeah.
 The
 the
 suicide
 rate
 is
 is


incredibly
 high
 and
 and
 it
 just
 makes


sense
 because
 these
 are
 young
 people
 who


have
 a
 sense
 of
 who
 they
 are
 and
 what


they're
 going
 to
 be
 doing
 in
 their
 life


and
 their
 whole
 identity
 gets
 rocked
 by


this
 diagnosis.


>> All
 right.
 Uh
 doctor,
 we're
 going
 to


have
 to
 leave
 it
 there,
 but
 really


appreciate
 your
 insights.
 Uh
 thank
 you


for
 this
 and
 of
 course
 um
 with
 this


there
 will
 be
 more
 things
 to
 come
 out
 of


this
 in
 terms
 of
 uh
 research
 and
 studies


and
 policy.
 So,
 we
 look
 forward
 to
 that


and
 uh
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thanks
 very
 much
 for
 having
 me.
