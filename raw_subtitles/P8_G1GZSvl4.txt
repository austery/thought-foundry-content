From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Bubaro.
 [music]
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


Heartbreak
 [music]
 over
 the
 holidays.


One
 of
 the
 two
 National
 Guard
 members


shot
 in
 the
 ambush
 attack
 near
 the
 White


House
 has
 passed
 away.
 Now,
 the
 suspect,


[music]


>> in
 the
 days
 since,
 an
 immigrant
 from


Afghanistan
 gunned
 down
 two
 members
 of


the
 National
 [music]
 Guard
 in


Washington,
 DC.
 In


>> response
 to
 that
 shooting,
 President


Trump
 is
 ordering
 a
 review
 of
 all
 Afghan


nationals
 in
 the
 US
 and
 halted.


>> [music]


>> says
 he
 has
 halted
 all
 asylum
 decisions


after
 the
 ambush
 attack
 on
 the
 two


national
 guard
 members.


>> President
 Trump
 has
 ordered
 a
 sweeping


new
 crackdown
 on
 immigration.


>> He's
 also
 promising
 to
 expel
 millions
 of


immigrants
 already
 here
 revoking
 their


legal
 status


>> that
 has
 left
 almost
 no
 corner
 of
 the


system
 untouched.
 He
 claimed
 he's
 ready


to
 expel
 [music]
 anyone
 who
 is
 quote
 not


a
 net
 asset
 to
 the
 United
 States.
 and
 he


threatened
 [music]
 to
 end
 immigration


from
 quote
 all
 third
 world
 countries.


CBS
 today,
 my
 [music]
 colleague
 Huh
 al


Aziz
 on
 the
 shooters
 journey
 to
 the


United
 States
 and
 the
 Trump


administration's
 [music]
 wide-ranging


response.


[music]


It's
 Monday,
 December
 [music]
 1st.
 Huh,


we
 are
 turning
 to
 you
 because
 what
 began


as
 a
 horrific
 shooting
 in
 downtown


Washington
 last
 week
 has
 now
 become
 a


set
 of
 far-reaching
 changes
 to
 the
 US


immigration
 system,
 which
 you
 cover
 for


the
 Times.
 Just
 how
 farreaching
 would


you
 say
 these
 changes
 are?
 Yeah,
 you


know,
 even
 for
 an
 administration
 that


has
 rewritten
 all
 the
 rules
 on
 how
 to


handle
 immigration,
 what
 we've
 seen
 in


just
 the
 last
 couple
 days
 has
 been


remarkable.
 They
 have
 blocked
 pathways


for
 people
 to
 come
 to
 this
 country,
 to


remain
 in
 the
 country,
 and
 at
 the
 same


time
 are
 going
 back
 and
 reviewing
 the


records
 of
 people
 who
 are
 have
 already


gained
 status
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 I


haven't
 seen
 anything
 like
 this
 during


my
 time
 covering
 immigration.


>> That
 fallout,
 which
 we
 will
 discuss
 in


detail
 in
 this
 conversation
 because
 it


very
 much
 feels
 like
 a
 template
 for
 the


future
 of
 immigration
 policy
 in
 the
 US.


It
 feels
 like
 it
 very
 much
 hinges
 on
 the


specific
 of
 who
 the
 shooter
 in
 this
 case


was,
 where
 he
 came
 from,
 the


circumstances
 of
 how
 he
 came
 into
 the


US.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 about
 that.


>> Yeah.
 The
 shooter's
 name
 is
 Rahmanula


Lakenwal.


He
 grew
 up
 in
 Afghanistan
 during
 this


time
 period
 in
 which
 the
 United
 States


had
 invaded.
 You
 know,
 in
 fact,
 he
 was


only
 5
 years
 old
 when
 9/11
 happened.
 And


of
 course,
 we
 know
 that
 the
 United


States
 came
 into
 Afghanistan
 shortly


afterward.
 During
 that
 time,
 the
 United


States
 relied
 heavily
 on
 local
 troops.


And
 one
 of
 the
 key
 groups
 that
 was


essential
 to
 the
 United
 States
 presence


in
 Afghanistan
 was
 this
 group
 called


Zero
 Unit.


>> Zero
 Unit.
 What
 is
 that?
 [snorts]
 They


were
 basically
 a
 CIA
 backed
 group
 that


hunted
 Taliban
 members
 were
 really


highly
 trained,
 highly
 vetted
 by
 the
 US


government,
 essentially
 reported
 to
 the


US
 government
 and
 went
 after
 key
 leaders


in
 the
 Taliban
 power
 structure.


>> Kind
 of
 the
 tip
 of
 the
 spear
 when
 it


comes
 to
 the
 US
 government
 and
 military


in
 Afghanistan.


>> Exactly.
 And
 and
 Mr.
 Lock
 and
 wall
 was
 a


part
 of
 that
 group.
 He
 was
 recruited
 by


the
 CIA
 to
 join
 this
 unit
 and
 his


brother
 was
 a
 key
 leader
 in
 the
 group
 as


well.
 So
 as
 a
 family,
 you
 know,
 they


were
 really
 inshed
 in
 this
 organization


that
 was
 essential
 to
 the
 United
 States


ability
 to
 maintain
 security
 in


Afghanistan.
 But
 human
 rights


organizations


criticized
 the
 work
 of
 this
 zero
 unit


group.
 They
 alleged
 that
 zero
 unit
 went


further
 than
 was
 necessary
 and
 they


called
 them
 death
 squads.
 They
 were


conducting
 extrajudicial
 killings,


killing
 civilians.
 These
 are
 all


allegations
 that
 were
 made
 during
 this


time
 about
 this
 group.
 And
 how


comfortable
 were
 people
 like
 Lock
 and


Wall
 Afghans
 in
 carrying
 out
 this
 kind


of
 alleged
 brutality
 against
 other


Afghans?


>> Yeah.
 What
 we've
 learned
 is
 that
 Mr.


Lockenwal
 specifically
 really
 struggled


with
 the
 actions
 that
 his
 group


undertook
 in
 Afghanistan.


and
 he
 expressed
 this
 to
 a
 friend
 in


Afghanistan
 who
 actually
 spoke
 with
 one


of
 our
 colleagues
 and
 this
 friend
 said


that
 Mr.
 Lock
 and
 Wall
 was
 going
 through


some
 mental
 health
 issues
 and
 really
 in


his
 telling
 this
 was
 clearly
 somebody


who
 was
 traumatized
 from
 his
 experience


as
 a
 part
 of
 zero
 unit.


>> But
 despite
 that
 he
 remained
 in
 this


unit
 up
 until
 the
 Taliban
 took
 over
 the


country
 in
 2021.


>> Well,
 bring
 us
 to
 that
 very
 dramatic


moment.
 What
 happens
 to
 lock
 and
 wall


when
 the
 US
 announces
 it's
 going
 to


withdraw,
 which
 as
 we
 all
 remember
 then


brings
 the
 Taliban
 through
 the
 country


toward
 Kbble.
 The
 Afghan
 military


collapses
 in
 days
 and
 the
 US
 military


flees
 in
 what
 I
 think
 we
 can
 all
 agree


is
 a
 kind
 of
 chaotic
 and
 somewhat


humiliating
 withdrawal.


>> For
 Lock
 and
 Wall
 and
 other
 Afghans
 who


closely
 helped
 the
 United
 States


government,
 suddenly
 they
 become
 targets


for
 the
 Taliban.
 And
 there's
 this


incredible
 pressure
 on
 the
 Biden


administration
 to
 [sighs]
 not
 leave


behind
 those
 people
 who
 risk
 their
 lives


in
 protecting
 the
 United
 States


government.


>> Essentially,
 they
 are
 traitors
 to
 the


now
 re-empowered
 Taliban.


>> Yeah.
 And
 Mr.
 Lockenwall
 along
 with


other
 members
 of
 the
 zero
 unit
 were


among
 the
 first
 people
 to
 flee


Afghanistan
 and
 be
 brought
 by
 the
 United


States
 government
 to
 America
 for


protection.


>> So
 he's
 brought
 to
 the
 United
 States
 by


the
 Biden
 administration.
 What
 are
 his


circumstances
 like
 and
 what
 kind
 of


vetting
 process
 occurs
 before
 he
 even


gets
 to
 the
 US?
 So
 he
 comes
 to
 the


United
 States
 as
 part
 of
 a
 program


called
 Operation
 Allies
 Welcome.
 And
 as


part
 of
 this
 program,
 the
 Biden


administration
 set
 up
 layers
 of
 vetting.


They
 collected
 biometrics
 from
 these


people
 and
 they
 ran
 their
 information


through
 US
 databases
 for
 any
 potential


terrorism
 hits,
 criminal
 hits,
 any


potentially
 derogatory
 information.
 Mhm.


>> And
 then
 when
 these
 individuals
 came
 to


the
 United
 States,
 the
 Department
 of


Homeland
 Security
 conducted
 another


layer
 of
 vetting
 by
 uh
 Customs
 and


Border
 Protection
 officers
 at
 the


airports.


>> So
 pretty
 rigorous.


>> Pretty
 rigorous.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 I


think
 it's
 important
 to
 note
 that
 the


AY's
 inspector
 general
 found
 that
 the


Biden
 administration
 had
 allowed
 two


people
 who
 were
 potential
 national


security
 threats
 to
 enter
 the
 country


despite
 that
 vetting.
 This
 was
 a
 really


hurried
 process.
 This
 wasn't
 something


that
 was
 planned
 years
 in
 the
 making,


months
 in
 the
 making.
 So,
 there
 were


clear
 issues
 with
 this
 program.


>> Um,
 and
 Mr.
 Lockamal
 comes
 really


quickly
 as
 is
 one
 of
 the
 first
 groups
 of


people
 to
 arrive
 in
 the
 United
 States
 as


part
 of
 this
 program
 in
 September
 2021.


He
 settles
 down
 in
 Bellingham,


Washington,
 uh
 a
 town
 that's
 near
 the


Canadian
 border,
 and
 he's
 trying
 to
 find


jobs
 there.
 He's
 a
 delivery
 driver.
 He's


staying
 with
 his
 uh
 wife
 and
 five


children
 in
 a
 apartment
 complex
 that
 is


a
 place
 where
 people
 who
 are
 down
 on


their
 luck
 are
 trying
 to
 rebuild
 their


lives.
 But
 despite
 this
 kind
 of


challenging
 circumstances
 for
 him
 in


April
 during
 the
 Trump
 administration,


he
 gains
 asylum.
 So
 he
 enters
 the
 US


under
 the
 Biden
 administration,
 but
 he


is
 officially
 granted
 asylum
 under
 the


Trump
 administration.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 the
 Biden
 administration


brought
 these
 people
 over
 from


Afghanistan
 under
 a
 power
 known
 as


parole.
 This
 is
 a
 temporary
 status
 that


only
 lasts
 a
 few
 years.
 It
 did
 not


provide
 these
 Afghans
 with
 a
 chance
 to


stay
 in
 the
 country
 permanently.
 that


was
 on
 Afghans
 individually
 in
 the


country
 to
 figure
 out
 a
 way
 to
 stay


here.


>> And
 in
 this
 case,
 he
 figured
 it
 out.


>> Yeah,
 this
 was
 clearly
 good
 news
 for
 him


to
 get
 asylum,
 to
 have
 a
 chance
 to


remain
 in
 the
 United
 States,
 to
 gain
 a


green
 card,
 to
 gain
 US
 citizenship.
 He


was
 on
 that
 pathway.
 But
 the
 next
 thing


we
 know
 is
 that
 he
 decides
 to


drive
 from
 Bellingham,
 Washington,
 all


across
 the
 country
 to
 Washington
 DC


where
 he
 finds
 himself
 in
 the
 downtown


of
 the
 city
 about
 a
 block
 or
 two
 from


the
 White
 House.
 This
 is
 an
 area
 that


has
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 going
 through
 it
 and


there
 are
 uh
 restaurants
 and
 coffee


shops.
 and
 he
 is
 walking
 on
 the
 sidewalk


near
 a
 bus
 stop
 where
 he
 comes
 across


two
 National
 Guard
 members
 from
 West


Virginia,


Sarah
 Beckram,
 a
 20-year-old,
 and
 Andrew


Wolf,
 a
 24
 year old.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 Mr.
 Lockenwald
 decides
 to
 pull
 out


his
 gun
 and
 shoot
 both
 of
 them
 multiple


times.
 As
 part
 of
 that
 gunfire,
 he


himself
 takes
 on
 shots,


>> right?
 and
 he
 is
 down
 on
 the
 ground.


These
 shots
 were
 heard
 by
 colleagues


here
 at
 the
 New
 York
 Times.
 Our
 bureau


is
 very
 close
 to
 the
 site
 of
 this


shooting.
 And
 just
 a
 day
 later,
 we
 found


out
 that
 one
 of
 the
 guard
 members,
 Miss


Beckram,
 had
 died
 from
 her
 gunshot


wounds.
 And
 suddenly,
 all
 of
 these


dramas
 are
 colliding.
 the
 war
 in


Afghanistan
 which
 Trump
 loathed
 as
 a


forever
 war
 and
 his
 use
 of
 national


guard
 across
 American
 cities.
 It's
 all


colliding
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 strange


moment.


Yeah,
 definitely.
 And
 and
 you
 can
 see


how
 for
 President
 Trump
 this
 is


something
 that
 he
 personally
 is
 tied
 to.


[music]


And
 for
 him,
 I
 think
 it
 really
 confirms


a
 lot
 of
 the
 claims
 that
 he's
 made
 in


the
 past.
 A
 lot
 of
 his
 worst
 fears
 that


an
 immigrant
 from
 a
 far-flung
 country


would
 come
 here
 and
 and
 shoot
 two


[music]


US
 military
 members
 near
 the
 White


House.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 reason
 for
 him


and
 in
 his
 mind
 and
 his
 advisers's
 mind


to
 undertake
 a
 crackdown
 on
 the


immigration
 system.
 That's
 unlike


anything
 that
 we've
 seen
 this
 year.


[music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So,
 Hammed,
 describe
 what
 happens
 to
 the


immigration
 system
 in
 the
 days
 since


this
 shooting
 and
 how
 the
 Trump


administration
 has
 explained
 those


actions.
 and
 the
 telling
 of
 top
 Trump


administration
 officials.
 [music]


>> A
 29-year-old
 Afghan
 who
 entered
 the


United
 States
 under
 Biden's
 Operation


Allies
 welcome
 a
 program
 following
 the


disastrous
 withdrawal
 from
 Afghanistan.


This
 is
 what
 happens.


>> Including
 US
 attorney
 Janine
 Piro.


>> This
 individual
 is
 in
 this
 country
 for


one
 reason
 and
 one
 reason
 alone.
 the


failure
 to
 vet
 in
 any
 way,
 shape,
 or


form
 this
 individual
 and
 countless


others.


>> The
 FBI
 director
 Cash
 Patel,


>> he
 was
 flown
 in
 by
 the
 Biden


administration
 in
 September
 2021
 on


those
 infamous
 flights
 that
 everybody


was
 talking
 about.
 Nobody
 knew
 who
 was


coming
 in.
 Nobody
 knew
 anything
 about


it.
 His
 status
 was


>> and
 President
 Trump
 himself,
 this


shooting
 was
 the
 result
 of
 a
 series
 of


Biden
 administration
 failures.
 Not
 only


in
 the
 way
 that
 they
 ended
 the
 war,


which
 President
 Trump
 has
 often


criticized,
 but
 in
 the
 way
 that
 they
 let


these
 Afghans,
 including
 Mr.
 Lackenwall,


into
 the
 country
 without,
 in
 their


words,
 the
 necessary
 vetting.
 [music]


Does
 the
 White
 House
 point
 to
 anything


specific
 as
 they're
 critiquing
 the


vetting
 process?
 Because
 of
 course,
 as


you
 told
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 earlier
 in
 this


conversation,
 it's
 the
 Trump


administration
 that
 grants
 that
 final


asylum.


Yeah.
 No,
 there's
 nothing
 specifically


that
 they're
 pointing
 to.
 And
 when


President
 Trump
 was
 asked
 about,
 you


know,
 this
 idea
 that
 they
 granted
 this


man
 asylum
 during
 his
 administration
 in


April,


>> right,


>> he
 wouldn't
 engage
 with
 that
 answer.
 And


again,
 he
 returned
 to
 this
 idea
 that,


you
 know,
 Biden
 brought
 him
 and
 once


people
 are
 brought
 to
 this
 country,


there's
 not
 much
 that
 they
 can
 do.


That's
 essentially
 what
 he
 said.


>> Understood.
 So,
 let's
 now
 turn
 to
 the


crackdown
 that
 [clears throat]
 Trump
 has


undertaken
 to
 the
 immigration
 system


over
 the
 past
 few
 days
 and
 really


understand
 the
 details
 of
 it.


>> Yeah.
 Basically,
 in
 a
 matter
 of
 days,


the
 Trump
 administration


takes
 a
 series
 of
 actions
 that
 have
 just


massive
 implications.
 [clears throat]


>> At
 first,
 the
 Department
 of
 Homeland


Security
 announces
 a
 pause
 on
 all


immigration
 applications
 filed
 by
 Afghan


immigrants.
 So,
 for
 Afghans
 in
 the


United
 States,
 this
 means
 a
 pause
 on


their
 ability
 to
 seek
 a
 green
 card,
 US


citizenship.


for
 them,
 their
 ability
 to
 stay
 in
 this


country
 long
 term
 is
 now
 on
 hold.


>> All
 that's
 just
 being
 shut
 down


temporarily
 perhaps,
 but
 shut
 down.


>> Yes,
 exactly.
 And
 they
 build
 on
 that.


They
 say
 that
 they
 will
 review
 all


asylum
 applications
 that
 were
 granted


during
 the
 Biden
 administration.
 They're


going,


>> no
 matter
 which
 country
 the
 asylum


seekers
 from,


>> all
 of
 it.
 They're
 going
 to
 go
 back
 and


look
 at
 those
 applications
 and
 figure


out
 if
 there
 were
 any
 issues
 with
 those


grants
 and
 again
 building
 on
 this
 idea


that
 the
 Biden
 administration
 in
 their


words
 did
 not
 do
 enough
 vetting.
 So


suddenly
 we're
 now
 talking
 about
 a
 pause


not
 just
 in
 those
 seeking
 asylum
 from


Afghanistan
 but
 potentially
 thousands
 or


tens
 of
 thousands
 of
 people
 seeking


asylum
 from
 any
 country
 in
 the
 world.


>> Exactly.
 So
 they're
 going
 back
 to
 look


at
 those
 records
 and
 they
 take
 it
 even
 a


step
 further.
 They
 decide
 that
 actually


we're
 going
 to
 review
 all
 green
 card


holders
 from
 countries
 that
 President


Trump
 already
 banned
 from
 travel
 to
 the


United
 States.
 You
 know,
 these
 were


countries
 like
 Iran,
 Aritria,


Sudan,
 and
 others.
 So,
 people
 who
 are


already
 in
 the
 United
 States
 who've
 gone


through
 a
 lot
 of
 process
 now
 have
 their


applications
 under
 review.
 In
 a
 sense,


this
 is
 a
 retrospective
 look
 back
 at


those
 who
 have
 in
 some
 cases
 already


been
 granted
 their
 green
 cards.
 They're


basically
 saying
 the
 old
 system
 is


suspect.
 So,
 we
 will
 kind
 of
 reopen
 your


green
 card.
 There
 is
 definitely
 that


potential.
 They're
 going
 to
 go
 back
 and


look
 at
 potentially
 hundreds
 of


thousands
 of
 records.


>> Wow.


>> A
 massive
 review.
 We
 don't
 know
 how
 this


is
 going
 to
 take
 shape
 and
 how
 they're


going
 to
 do
 this,
 but
 they've
 announced


that
 they
 will
 do
 this.
 And
 then
 on


Friday
 after
 they'd
 already
 announced


that
 they
 were
 going
 to
 review
 all
 the


people
 that
 had
 gotten
 asylum
 between


2021
 and
 2024,


but
 now
 people
 already
 in
 the
 United


States
 trying
 to
 gain
 asylum
 in
 the


process,
 those
 applications
 are
 now
 on


hold
 as
 well.
 Really
 going
 after
 the


entire
 asylum
 system.
 And
 on
 that
 same


day,
 the
 State
 Department
 announces
 that


there
 will
 be
 no
 more
 visas
 for
 Afghan


nationals,
 cutting
 off
 another
 way
 for


Afghans
 to
 enter
 the
 United
 States.
 And


in
 fact,
 a
 State
 Department
 cable
 that


we
 obtained
 detailed
 how
 Afghan


nationals
 who
 already
 had
 their
 visas


granted
 and
 printed
 and
 and
 were
 going


to
 be
 dispersed
 to
 those
 Afghans,
 those


needed
 to
 be
 destroyed.


>> Wow.
 So
 they're
 taking
 every
 step


possible
 to
 target
 Afghans,
 not
 only
 in


America,
 but
 abroad.


>> And
 not
 just
 from
 what
 you
 said,


Afghans,
 but
 really
 anyone
 seeking


asylum
 or
 a
 green
 card.
 In
 a
 very
 real


sense,
 it
 feels
 like
 the
 entire
 system


of
 giving
 foreigners
 refuge
 in
 the
 US


for
 political
 or
 economic
 circumstances


is
 on
 pause.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know
 what's
 really
 remarkable


here
 is
 this
 idea
 that
 yes,
 we're
 going


to
 pause
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 from
 entering


the
 United
 States,
 but
 we're
 also
 going


to
 go
 back
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 review


people
 who've
 already
 obtained
 a
 form
 of


status
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 We're
 going


to
 go
 back
 and
 look
 at
 those
 records
 as


well.
 So,
 it's
 not
 only
 prospective,
 but


it's
 retrospective
 as
 well.


>> Does
 this
 administration
 have
 the
 legal


power
 to
 do
 everything
 you're


describing?
 because
 it
 is
 so
 sweeping


and
 so
 retrospective.


>> Yeah,
 these
 will
 undoubtedly
 lead
 to


legal
 challenges
 especially
 this
 idea
 of


going
 back.
 These
 are
 people
 who
 have


gone
 through
 layers
 of
 vetting,
 layers


of
 interviews,
 extensive
 interaction


with
 the
 US
 government
 that
 if
 they
 take


action
 on
 those
 people
 that
 will
 lead


to,
 I
 think,
 legal
 action
 across
 the


United
 States.


So,
 we're
 going to
 have
 to
 wait
 and
 see


how
 this
 plays
 out
 in
 our
 legal
 system.


I
 want
 to
 return
 for
 just
 a
 moment
 to


Afghanistan
 because
 as
 broad
 as
 some
 of


these
 potential
 changes
 to
 our


immigration
 system
 are,
 what
 stands
 out


to
 me
 is
 what
 these
 changes
 will
 mean


for
 the
 future
 of
 that
 promise
 that
 the


US
 made
 to
 Afghans
 who
 helped
 America
 in


the
 war.
 And
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Lock


andwell,
 yes,
 the
 promise
 was
 kept,
 but


it's
 clear
 from
 Trump's
 actions
 that
 the


promise
 won't
 be
 kept
 for
 anyone
 else


from
 Afghanistan
 in
 the
 future.
 And


there's
 a
 very
 revealing
 exchange
 about


this
 on
 social
 media
 over
 the
 past


couple
 of
 days
 that
 I
 want
 to
 discuss


with
 you.
 It
 begins
 with
 an
 editorial


from
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal,
 which
 is
 a


very
 conservative
 editorial
 board.
 And


I'm
 gonna
 read
 you
 what
 they
 wrote
 in


his
 editorial.


>> Okay.


>> Quote,
 "Some
 will
 say
 that
 the
 shooting


in
 downtown
 Washington
 means
 that
 the


United
 States
 should
 never
 admit


refugees
 like
 Lock
 and
 Wall,
 but
 the


alternative
 is
 abandoning
 allies
 who


assist
 Americans
 in
 war."
 And
 the


editorial
 goes
 on
 to
 say,
 "You
 can
 be


sure
 Americans
 will
 fight
 overseas


again,
 and
 our
 troops
 will
 need
 allies


on
 the
 ground
 to
 succeed.
 How
 many,"
 the


editorial
 asks,
 will
 assist
 the
 US
 if


they
 believe
 that
 there
 will
 be
 no
 exit


for
 them?
 Basically,
 this
 editorial


asks,
 "What
 happens
 when
 the
 US
 just


leaves
 people
 behind
 on
 the
 battlefield?


Yeah.
 And
 one
 person
 who
 reads
 this


editorial
 and
 disagrees
 with
 it
 strongly


is
 the
 chief
 of
 President
 Trump's


immigration
 crackdown,
 Steven
 Miller.
 He


went
 online
 on
 on
 social
 media
 and
 said,


quote,
 "This
 is
 the
 great
 lie
 of
 mass


migration.
 You
 are
 not
 just
 importing


individuals.
 You
 are
 importing


societies.
 No
 magic
 transformation


occurs
 when
 failed
 states
 cross
 borders.


At
 scale,
 migrants
 and
 their
 descendants


recreate
 the
 conditions
 and
 terrors
 of


their
 broken
 homelands.


Will
 you
 just
 translate
 that?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 what's
 remarkable


about
 this
 tweet
 is
 that
 Miller
 is
 not


only
 turning
 to
 the
 immigrants


themselves
 who
 arrive
 in
 the
 United


States,
 but
 he's
 saying
 that
 their


children
 are
 a
 threat
 as
 well.


>> Right.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 worth
 saying


just
 how
 much
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


editorial
 and
 Steven
 Miller's
 statements


completely
 talk
 past
 each
 other
 because


the
 editorial


is
 saying
 that
 American
 credibility
 and


the
 future
 of
 our
 foreign
 policy


requires
 us
 to
 keep
 our
 commitments
 to


those
 who
 risk
 their
 lives
 for
 the
 US.


That
 it's
 foundational
 to
 our
 ability
 to


function
 in
 the
 world.
 Miller's


statement
 completely
 bypasses
 that
 and


says
 broken
 people
 from
 broken
 societies


are
 just
 an
 existential
 danger
 to
 the


US.
 Therefore,
 we
 can't
 let
 them
 in.
 But


what
 Miller's
 argument
 doesn't
 grapple


with
 at
 all
 is
 the
 reality
 that
 America


played
 a
 part
 and
 a
 pretty
 big
 part
 in


breaking
 Afghanistan
 in
 the
 first
 place.


>> Yeah.
 For
 Miller,
 that's
 besides
 the


point.
 It's
 not
 about
 what
 America
 owes


people
 and
 countries.
 It's
 about
 who's


good
 for
 the
 United
 States
 and
 who's
 not


good.
 People
 who
 are
 from
 countries
 that


he
 has
 deemed
 to
 be
 failed
 societies
 do


not
 deserve
 the
 opportunity
 to
 come
 to


America.
 Right?
 It's
 kind
 of
 an
 open


embrace
 of
 collective
 punishment
 because


in
 Lock
 and
 Wall
 we
 clearly
 have
 someone


who
 and
 we
 don't
 quite
 understand
 the


mechanics
 of
 it
 but
 becomes
 at
 some


point
 in
 his
 life
 radicalized
 but
 he's


just
 one
 of
 thousands
 if
 not
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 Afghans
 who
 the
 US


previously
 made
 a
 commitment
 to
 to


protect
 and
 bring
 to
 the
 US.
 and
 Trump


and
 Steven
 Miller
 are
 now
 saying
 because


one
 of
 them
 did
 this
 thing,
 none
 of
 them


[clears throat]


can
 come
 to
 the
 US.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 I
 think
 that's
 right.


[snorts]
 But
 I
 also
 just
 want
 to
 point


out
 this
 idea
 that
 like
 like
 you're


mentioning
 collective
 punishment.
 These


Afghans
 who
 helped
 the
 American
 military


have
 been
 supported
 by
 veterans.
 M


>> you
 know
 I've
 spoken
 with
 veterans
 who


have
 personally
 tried
 to
 bring
 those


people
 who
 helped
 them
 translators
 and


others
 to
 the
 United
 States
 bring
 them


to
 safety.
 I
 mean
 the
 plot
 point
 of
 this


idea
 of
 Afghans
 helping
 American


military
 members
 has
 been
 in
 movies
 and


shows


>> and
 for
 now
 this
 idea
 of
 helping
 Afghans


who
 helped
 the
 American
 military
 in


Afghanistan
 that's
 over.


Just
 to
 end,
 Hammed,
 I
 don't
 want
 to


entirely
 lose
 sight
 of
 the
 National


Guard
 and
 its
 place
 in
 this
 story.
 The


second
 Guardsman
 who
 was
 shot
 remains
 in


critical
 condition
 in
 the
 hospital
 and


this
 deployment
 of
 the
 National
 Guard
 in


Washington
 remains
 a
 source
 of
 really


profound
 controversy.


>> Yeah.
 This
 idea
 of
 bringing
 the
 federal


forces
 to
 the
 city
 was
 really
 opposed
 by


a
 lot
 of
 citizens
 in
 Washington
 DC.


[music]


But
 in
 the
 days
 since
 the
 shooting,


President
 Trump
 has
 announced
 that
 he


was
 planning
 to
 send
 500
 more
 National


Guard
 members
 to
 Washington
 DC.


So
 now
 this
 deployment


far
 from
 shrinking
 because
 of
 this


shooting
 is
 now
 going
 to
 expand
 because


[music]
 of
 it.


Muhammad,
 thank
 you
 very
 much.
 We


appreciate
 it.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.


[music]


[music]


On
 Sunday,
 the
 Secretary
 of
 Homeland


Security,
 Christy
 [music]
 Gnome,
 told


NBC
 News
 that
 the
 alleged
 shooter
 may


not
 have
 become
 radicalized
 until
 after


he
 immigrated
 to
 the
 United
 States.


[music]


That
 conclusion,
 if
 true,
 could


undermine
 the
 Trump
 administration's


claims
 [music]
 that
 the
 Biden


administration
 had
 failed
 to
 properly


vet
 him
 before
 he
 arrived
 [music]
 into


the
 country.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


>> [music]


>> Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 [music]


know
 today.
 Over
 the
 past
 few
 days,


President
 Trump
 has
 carried
 out
 a
 series


of
 profoundly
 contradictory
 actions
 in


his
 war
 against
 drug
 cartels.
 Trump


declared
 in
 a
 post
 on
 social
 media
 that


the
 airspace
 above
 and
 around
 Venezuela,


which
 he
 is
 accused
 of
 flooding
 the
 US


with
 drugs,
 should
 now
 be
 considered


closed.
 It
 was
 his
 latest
 threat
 [music]


against
 the
 regime
 of
 Venezuela's


authoritarian
 leader,
 Nicholas
 Maduro.


But
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 Trump
 announced
 a


full
 pardon
 of
 a
 former
 president
 of


Honduras,
 [music]
 Juan
 Orlando


Hernandez,
 who
 has
 been
 convicted
 in
 US


federal
 court
 [music]
 of
 conspiring
 with


local
 drug
 cartels
 to
 bring
 vast
 amounts


of
 cocaine
 into
 the
 United
 States.


Meanwhile,
 [music]


on
 Sunday,
 members
 of
 Congress
 from
 both


parties
 said
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 may
 have
 committed
 a
 war


crime
 [music]
 in
 its
 offensive
 against


boats
 allegedly
 carrying
 drugs
 in
 the


Caribbean.
 According
 to
 the
 Washington


Post,
 Defense
 Secretary
 Pete
 Hgsth
 gave


a
 verbal
 order
 to
 kill
 everyone
 aboard


such
 boats,
 [music]
 leading
 a
 US


military
 commander
 to
 carry
 out
 a
 second


strike
 [music]
 to
 kill
 those
 who
 had


survived
 an
 initial
 air
 strike
 back
 in


[music]
 September.


>> Do
 you
 believe
 if
 there
 was
 a
 second


strike
 to
 eliminate
 [music]
 any


survivors
 that
 that
 constitutes
 a
 war


crime?
 It
 seems
 to
 uh
 if
 what
 [music]


has
 been
 reported
 is
 AC
 accurate,
 I've


got
 serious
 concerns
 about
 anybody
 in


that,
 you
 know,
 chain
 of
 command
 [music]


stepping
 over
 a
 line
 that
 they
 should


never
 step
 over.
 You
 know,
 going
 after


survivors
 in
 the
 water,
 um
 that
 is


clearly
 [music]
 not
 lawful.
 Both


Democratic
 Senator
 Mark
 Kelly
 of
 Arizona


on
 CNN
 and
 Republican
 Representative


Mike
 Turner
 of
 Ohio
 on
 CBS
 [music]
 said


that
 such
 a
 second
 strike
 would
 violate


the
 rules
 of
 war.


>> Obviously,
 if
 that
 occurred,
 that
 would


be
 be
 very
 serious
 and
 I
 agree
 that
 that


[music]
 that
 would
 would
 be
 an
 illegal


act.
 Turner
 said
 that
 the
 post
 reporting


on
 [music]
 the
 second
 strike
 would


become
 the
 focus
 of
 an
 existing


congressional
 investigation
 into
 the
 air


[music]
 strikes
 on
 the
 boats.
