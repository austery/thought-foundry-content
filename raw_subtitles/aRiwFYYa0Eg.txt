Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 OddLotss
 podcast.
 I'm
 Jill


Weisenthal
 and
 I'm
 Tracy
 Aloway.
 Tracy,


there's
 a
 lot
 we've
 discussed
 about


multistrategy
 hedge
 funds,
 but
 there's


still
 a
 lot
 we
 don't
 know.
 And


specifically,
 although
 I've
 come
 to


learn
 things
 about
 comp
 and
 alignment


and
 the
 importance
 of
 risk
 management


and
 risk
 models
 and
 all
 that
 stuff,
 I


actually
 don't
 know
 like
 how
 how
 the


pods
 make
 good
 trades.
 This
 is
 part
 298


of
 our
 attempt
 to
 understand
 multistrat


hedge
 funds.
 That's
 what
 it
 is.
 But


you're
 right,
 we
 haven't
 really
 looked


at
 it
 from
 the
 I
 guess
 the
 perspective


of
 a
 PM
 who
 is
 actually
 working
 there


and
 what
 it
 takes
 to
 get
 hired,
 what
 it


takes
 to
 avoid
 getting
 fired
 and
 things


like
 that.
 I
 have
 a
 feeling
 that
 like


avoiding
 getting
 fired
 is
 a
 really
 big


part
 of
 the
 story.
 Like
 you
 want
 to
 do


well,
 right?
 You
 want
 to
 make
 money
 and


all
 that,
 but
 I
 also
 get
 the
 impression


that
 you
 just
 want
 to
 hang
 on
 to
 that


seat
 for
 a
 really
 long
 time.
 And
 that
 a


big
 part
 of
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 game
 is


the
 word,
 but
 a
 big
 part
 of
 the
 game
 is


yeah,
 holding
 on
 to
 that
 seat,
 avoiding


being
 part
 of
 any
 given
 call,
 avoiding


having
 your
 name
 show
 up
 on
 Bloomberg
 in


a
 story
 that
 gets
 read
 spiked
 about
 so


and
 so
 out
 after
 losing
 260
 million
 or


whatever
 in
 a
 trade.
 This
 is
 exactly


what
 I
 was
 wondering.
 Like
 how
 do
 the


draw
 downs
 actually
 impact
 a
 bunch
 of


PMs?
 Is
 it
 like
 really
 embarrassing
 and


does
 it
 have
 like
 an
 actual
 effect
 on


their
 trading?
 I
 imagine
 it
 does
 and
 it


must
 have
 an
 effect
 on
 their
 confidence


as
 well
 but
 I
 am
 very
 interested
 in
 this


subject
 and
 we
 have
 joked
 a
 number
 of


times
 about
 you
 know
 if
 we
 were
 at
 a


multistrat
 hedge
 fund
 things
 like
 that


so
 maybe
 we'll
 get
 a
 better
 idea
 yeah
 we


definitely
 have
 to
 learn
 more
 about
 the


pod
 level
 because
 I
 do
 get
 the


impression
 from
 talking
 to
 some
 people


we
 talked
 to
 running
 cosgrave
 recently


it's
 like
 oh
 you
 just
 put
 a
 bunch
 of


people
 in
 a
 room
 and
 if
 you
 have
 the


risk
 management
 right
 it
 kind
 of
 works


out
 anyway
 we're
 going
 to
 continue
 our


journey
 of
 learning
 more
 about
 these
 big


uh
 there's
 a
 natural
 affinity
 between


podcasts
 and
 pod
 shops.
 Oh,
 let's
 put
 it


that
 way.
 That's
 right.
 God,
 wouldn't


you
 hate
 it
 if
 like
 if
 we
 screwed
 up
 or


like
 we
 had
 like
 an
 episode
 that
 didn't


do
 very
 well
 and
 our
 traffic
 was
 down
 or


something
 and
 there
 was
 like
 a
 big


article
 on
 it's
 like
 Joe
 and
 Tracy
 out


after,
 you
 know,
 after
 one
 month
 of


underperformance
 on
 the
 podcast.
 Oh


yeah.
 Well,
 this
 is
 the
 other
 thing
 like


what
 happens
 if
 you
 outperform
 for
 like


half
 the
 year
 and
 then
 you
 underperform


for
 the
 second
 half
 of
 the
 year
 and
 how


is
 that
 actually
 calculated
 in
 terms
 of


your
 comp?
 Totally.
 And
 this
 came
 up


before
 which
 is
 that
 people
 who
 have


really
 good
 starts
 the
 fun
 at
 the
 fund


level
 you
 don't
 want
 them
 taking
 off


risk
 just
 to
 lock
 in
 their
 annual


bonuses.
 So
 these
 are
 important


questions.
 Anyway,
 let's
 dive
 right
 into


it.
 We
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest,
 someone


with
 a
 long
 track
 record
 and
 experience


across
 many
 aspects
 of
 this
 space.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Brian


Yelington.
 He's
 currently
 a
 consultant


for
 executive
 search
 firm
 Carrington


Fox,
 but
 he's
 been
 a
 former
 analyst
 and


PM
 at
 several
 large
 multistrand
 funds,


Millennium,
 More
 Capital,
 etc.
 a
 few


others
 in
 there.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 Brian,


thank
 you
 so
 much
 for,
 uh,
 coming
 on


OddLots.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 Great


to
 be
 here.
 I
 always
 enjoy
 the
 podcast


and
 enjoy
 hearing
 the
 very
 subject
 you


guys
 come
 up
 with.
 Oh,
 thank
 you.
 We


love
 to
 hear
 it.
 We're
 going
 to
 clip


that
 and
 put
 it
 in
 the
 mix.
 Before
 we
 go


on,
 like
 why
 don't
 you
 just
 give
 us
 the


real
 brief
 version
 of
 like
 who
 are
 you


and
 why
 are
 we
 talking
 to
 you
 other
 than


the
 fact
 that
 if
 I
 go
 to
 your
 LinkedIn


page,
 there
 are
 a
 bunch
 of
 uh,
 famous


companies
 listed
 on
 it.
 Yeah,
 probably
 a


few
 too
 many
 for
 my
 taste
 to
 be
 honest.


I've
 kind
 of
 been
 one
 of
 the
 few
 people


who've
 been
 both
 a
 pod
 PM
 as
 well
 as


kind
 of
 helped
 bring
 those
 people
 into
 a


large
 multistrat.
 I
 left
 the
 risk-taking


world
 and
 went
 to
 work
 in
 the
 business


development
 area.
 Business
 development


is
 just
 a
 badly
 disguised
 euphemism
 for


manager
 selection,
 although
 it
 means


very
 different
 things
 at
 very
 different


firms.
 So,
 I've
 seen
 it
 both
 from
 a


junior
 analyst
 side
 to
 a
 senior
 PM
 to


the
 person
 who's
 the
 necessary
 if
 not


sufficient
 gatekeeper
 at
 a
 hedge
 fund.


I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 where
 to
 start


because
 there's
 so
 much
 for
 us
 to
 talk


about,
 but
 if
 I'm
 a
 PM
 and
 I
 am
 applying


to
 a
 multistrat,


what
 would
 my
 CV
 or
 resume
 actually
 look


like?
 And
 then
 B,
 would
 I
 even
 be


applying
 to
 a
 multistrat
 or
 would
 I
 be


head-h
 hunted
 and
 they
 would
 find
 me?


The
 chances
 are
 generally
 better
 that
 if


you're
 an
 established
 PM,
 you
 would


probably
 come
 either
 through,
 you
 know,


direct
 from
 the
 BD
 team
 who
 said,
 "We


need
 somebody
 who
 represents
 the
 same


risk
 that
 Tracy
 represents.
 We
 hear


she's
 great.
 We'd
 love
 to
 speak
 to
 her."


or
 through
 an
 executive
 search
 firm
 who


that's
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 turnover
 in
 this


industry
 and
 they
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 business


as
 a
 result.
 So,
 how
 do
 you
 know
 if


someone
 is
 actually
 good?
 Because
 this


seems
 to
 be
 like
 one
 of
 the
 core


challenges
 in
 really
 all
 investing,


right?
 Like
 past
 results
 are
 no


guarantee
 of
 future
 returns.
 Everything


always
 says
 that.
 Uh
 you
 don't
 know
 it's


just
 a
 lucky
 streak,
 etc.
 So,
 u
 let's
 go


through
 this
 process.
 You
 want
 to


establish
 if
 someone
 is
 actually
 a
 good


investor
 or
 trader
 or
 portfolio
 manager


or
 whatever.
 Walk
 us
 through
 the
 steps


of
 like
 how
 you
 actually
 would
 identify


if
 Tracy
 is
 good
 at
 her
 job.
 Exactly.


Well,
 first
 a
 caveat.
 You're
 never
 going


to
 know.
 Okay.
 The
 reason
 that
 past


performance
 is
 not
 indicative
 of
 future


returns
 is
 because
 it's
 the
 future
 and


we
 never
 know
 how
 somebody's
 going
 to


act.
 So,
 what
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 during
 our


first
 conversation,
 Tracy,
 is
 I'm
 going


to
 ask
 sort
 of
 like
 you
 guys
 did
 a


little
 bit
 about
 your
 background.
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 looking
 for
 things
 like


where
 we
 might
 know
 people
 in
 common,


where
 you
 might
 have
 worked
 for
 a
 really


good
 group
 or
 something
 like
 that
 that


had
 a
 great
 reputation.
 And
 then
 we're


going
 to
 get
 into
 the
 nitty-gritty
 of


the
 conversation
 where
 I
 ask
 you
 in


great
 detail,
 you
 know,
 what
 is
 your


edge?
 That
 part's
 actually
 not
 too


detailed.
 You
 should
 be
 able
 to


elucidate
 that
 sort
 of
 standing
 on
 one


foot.
 Then
 I'm
 going
 to
 go
 into
 Wait,


actually,
 can
 you
 pause?
 Just
 give
 me
 if


that's
 an
 easy
 part.
 What
 is
 it?
 Because


this
 is
 actually
 something
 that
 I'm


completely
 in
 the
 dark
 about.
 How
 does


someone
 go
 about
 articulating
 an
 edge
 in


plain
 English
 during
 an
 interview?
 Like


what
 does
 that
 actually
 sound
 like?
 You


say,
 "Okay,
 like
 Brian,
 what's
 your


edge?
 You
 used
 to
 trade
 fixed
 income
 at


where
 and
 where.
 Brian,
 what
 was
 your


edge?"
 Well,
 I
 probably
 didn't
 have
 a


very
 good
 one,
 but
 my
 edge
 was
 usually


from
 the
 research
 side.
 Uh
 what
 I
 will


tell
 you
 is
 PMs
 who
 are
 extremely
 good


at
 their
 jobs
 have
 boiled
 down
 what


their
 edge
 is
 to
 a
 very
 welldefined


two
 or
 three
 sentence
 elevator
 pitch


style
 answer.
 And
 the
 reason
 that


they're
 able
 to
 do
 that
 is
 because
 this


is
 something
 they've
 been
 doing
 a
 long


time
 and
 they've
 made
 a
 huge
 number
 of


mistakes
 and
 they
 know
 exactly
 the
 alpha


that
 they
 want
 to
 identify
 are
 good
 at


identifying
 and
 what
 they
 go
 after.
 So,


it's
 going
 to
 sound
 different
 for


everybody.
 For,
 you
 know,
 a
 macro
 RV


type
 of
 fund,
 it
 may
 be
 that
 they
 really


anticipate
 the
 um
 the
 shifts
 in
 monetary


policy.
 For
 a
 credit
 fund,
 it's
 that


maybe
 they
 understand,
 you
 know,


corporate
 actions
 and
 they're
 really


good
 at
 reading
 between
 the
 lines
 of


maybe
 even
 a
 specific
 niche
 of


companies.
 Um,
 so
 it's
 going
 to
 differ,


but
 you
 can
 usually
 tell
 by
 someone's


answer
 there,
 how
 much
 they
 thought
 of


it.
 The
 bad
 answers
 tend
 to
 be
 something


that
 relies
 on
 experience.
 I'll
 note


that
 there
 aren't
 too
 many
 oxygenerian


PMs
 or
 something
 that
 relies
 on,
 well,


I'm
 just
 really
 good
 at
 this.
 You
 kind


of
 have
 to
 be
 able
 to
 identify
 it
 to
 to


be
 good
 at
 it.
 So,
 going
 back
 to


performance
 metrics,
 like
 what
 figures


or
 numbers
 are
 actually
 available
 here?


You
 know,
 does
 a
 potential
 PM
 come


bearing
 sharp
 ratios?
 And
 then
 how
 does


the
 uh
 potential
 hiring
 firm
 actually
 do


due
 diligence
 on
 some
 of
 those
 numbers?


It's
 difficult
 and
 the
 the
 reality
 is


that
 you
 know
 P&L
 even
 within
 a
 firm
 as


a
 BD
 person
 and
 again
 BD
 is
 very


different
 from
 firm
 to
 firm.
 But
 if
 I


were
 to
 hire
 Tracy
 as
 a
 PM
 I'm


regretting
 using
 myself
 as
 an
 example
 by


the
 way.
 This
 is
 good.
 This
 is
 good.
 No,


we're
 going
 to
 have
 you
 do
 well.


we'll
 we'll
 flunk
 out
 somebody
 else.
 But


if
 we
 were
 to
 fire
 Tracy,
 in
 some
 places


I
 might
 not
 even
 be
 aware
 of
 how
 she's


doing
 six
 months
 after
 we
 hired.
 At


others,
 I
 would
 have
 kind
 of
 perfect


insight.
 P&Ls
 are
 extremely
 closely


guarded
 secrets.
 Usually
 they're
 not


discussed
 within
 the
 firm
 except
 for
 a


very
 few
 select
 group
 of
 people
 and


nobody's
 going
 to
 attest
 to
 that
 P&L,


right?
 You
 of
 your
 own
 accord,
 Tracy,


might
 provide
 some
 assurance
 to


somebody.
 Maybe
 it's
 because
 you're
 past


comp
 or
 something.
 They
 can't
 ask,
 but


you
 can
 certainly
 say,
 "Hey,
 by
 the
 way,


there's
 proof
 that
 I
 did
 what
 I
 did.


That's
 your
 prerogative."
 Wait,
 why


can't
 they
 ask?
 I
 believe
 that's
 an


employment
 law.
 You're
 not
 allowed
 to


ask.
 Uh,
 it
 might
 not
 been
 designed
 to


protect
 uh
 hedge
 fund
 PMs,
 but
 I
 believe


it
 does
 cover
 them
 somewhat.
 Tracy,
 I've


brought
 it
 up
 once
 or
 twice.
 I
 told
 you


I
 have
 talked
 about
 the
 time
 that
 I


interviewed
 at
 a
 prop
 trading
 firm,


right?
 Many,
 many
 times,
 Joe.
 Yes.
 Are


you
 going
 to
 tell
 the
 story
 again?
 You


can
 if
 you
 want.
 I'll
 just
 tell
 the


brief
 one,
 which
 is
 that
 when
 I
 was


living
 in
 Austin,
 which
 you
 are,
 Brian,


you're
 there
 now.
 I
 interviewed
 at
 a


prop
 trading
 firm
 when
 I
 was
 right
 out


of
 college.
 There
 were
 200
 interviews


and
 they
 asked
 me
 about
 my
 own
 trading


when
 I
 used
 to
 day
 trade
 on
 Erade
 by


myself
 and
 I
 told
 them
 a
 little
 about
 my


trades.
 They
 made
 me
 play
 a
 video
 game


to
 test
 my
 hand
 eye
 coordination
 and


then
 they
 made
 me
 play
 ping
 pong
 against


the
 CEO.
 I'm
 not
 really
 sure
 what
 that


was
 all
 about,
 but
 then
 I
 was
 one
 of
 I


was
 one
 I
 was
 one
 of
 four
 people
 who
 got


offered
 the
 job
 and
 then
 for
 some
 reason


I
 didn't
 take
 it.
 Didn't
 you
 work
 at
 a


sandwich
 shop
 and
 I
 was
 making


sandwiches
 at
 the
 Wheatzville
 Food
 Co-op


at
 the
 time
 and
 all
 my
 friends
 were


working
 there.
 I
 was
 like,
 I
 don't


really
 feel
 like
 working
 the
 corporate


life
 just
 yet
 and
 everything
 worked
 out


and
 it
 was
 fine.
 That's
 still
 one
 of the


stranger
 times
 of
 my
 life.
 But
 it
 was


kind
 of
 like
 this
 where
 they
 asked
 me


specifics.
 All right,
 here's
 a
 more


important
 question.
 It's
 great
 to
 say


like
 if
 you're
 a
 PM
 then
 you
 show,
 but


the
 first
 you
 got
 to
 become
 a
 PM.
 What


does
 an
 analyst
 do?
 So,
 so
 a
 PM
 has
 a


pod
 and
 they
 have
 analysts
 in
 their
 pod.


What
 does
 an
 analyst
 actually
 do?
 Just


as
 with
 the
 street,
 you
 know,
 how


they're
 analysts
 in
 function
 and


analysts
 in
 rank,
 if
 you
 will,
 odds
 will


generally
 have
 analysts
 covering,
 you


know,
 specific
 areas.
 Basically,
 at
 most


firms,
 it's
 sort
 of
 a
 euphemism.
 If
 you


have
 trading
 authority,
 you're
 either
 a


trader,
 a
 subpm,
 or
 a
 PM.
 If
 you
 do
 not


have
 trading
 authority,
 but
 you're
 still


committing
 or
 contributing
 to
 investment


decisions,
 you're
 an
 analyst.
 It's
 just


a
 generic
 catchall
 term.


But
 you
 are
 generally
 in
 charge
 of


building
 the
 you
 know
 specific
 type
 of


surveillance
 that
 the
 pod
 needs.
 You
 may


have
 names
 or
 industries
 or
 specific


areas
 of
 a
 specific
 market
 to
 cover
 and


you're
 being
 eyes
 and
 ears
 and
 you
 will


have
 specific
 projects.
 You
 know
 in
 our


current
 environment
 there's
 no
 no


shortage
 of
 things
 to
 test
 out
 and
 look


into
 as
 to
 how
 policies
 may
 change.
 So


if
 you're
 in
 a
 macro
 pod
 you're
 probably


pretty
 busy
 right
 now.
 presumably
 you


don't
 have
 to
 make
 perfect
 PowerPoint


presentations
 for
 potential
 deals
 and


things
 like
 that.
 It's
 much
 more
 idea


generation
 and
 I
 guess
 like
 back


testing.
 There's,
 you
 know,
 there
 again,


it
 kind
 of
 depends
 on
 the
 type
 of
 pod


that
 you're
 in.
 If
 you're
 in
 a
 very


directional
 macro
 pod,
 you're
 probably


looking
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 historical


analoges.
 You
 know,
 how
 has
 policy


responded
 in
 the
 past?
 If
 you
 are
 in
 a


more
 quantitatively
 oriented
 pod,
 maybe


something
 that
 does
 some
 form
 of


arbitrage,
 yes,
 lots
 of
 back
 testing,


lots
 of
 mathematical
 competency,
 but


it's
 interesting
 who
 I've
 seen
 make
 the


jump.
 I've
 seen
 a
 salesperson
 who


basically
 just
 sent
 out
 a
 weekly


commentary
 with
 a
 model
 portfolio
 in
 it


and
 people
 loved
 it
 and
 PM
 said,
 "Hey,


we
 want
 to
 talk
 to
 this
 person.
 Will
 you


go
 talk
 to
 him
 for
 us?"
 analysts,


publicing
 analysts.
 Joe,
 you
 and
 I


actually
 have
 a
 mutual
 friend
 that


you've
 had
 on
 the
 show
 before
 who
 was


kind
 of up
 writing
 for
 a
 newsletter.
 And


it
 was
 a
 newsletter
 I
 can
 tell
 you
 that


most
 every
 PM
 I
 knew
 in
 macro
 was


reading
 and
 he
 built
 his
 audience
 on


Twitter
 or
 X,
 sorry,
 that
 doesn't
 make
 a


very
 good
 verb.


[Music]


All
 right.
 And
 then
 if
 I
 am
 running
 a


pod
 shop,
 what
 exactly
 am
 I
 looking
 for


in
 terms
 of
 potential
 PM?
 So,
 I
 get


probably
 past
 performance
 even
 though,


as
 we
 discussed,
 it's
 not
 a
 perfect


indicator
 of
 future
 performance,
 but
 am


I
 looking
 at
 personality?
 Like
 would
 I


hire
 a
 complete
 jerk
 who
 happens
 to
 be
 a


star
 trader
 because
 it
 doesn't
 really


matter
 how
 he
 works
 with
 other
 people


because
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 completely


independent
 or
 would
 I
 be
 looking
 at
 it


very
 holistically
 and
 taking
 a
 sort
 of


moneyball
 approach
 where
 I'm
 trying
 to


fill
 in
 or
 plug
 specific
 gaps
 in
 my


overall
 business
 with
 maybe
 players
 or


traders
 that
 are
 undervalued
 by
 the


market.
 I
 think
 you're
 always
 trying
 to


play
 the
 moneyball
 approach.
 However,


most
 hedge
 funds
 differ
 a
 lot
 in
 how


internally
 they
 communicate.
 There
 are


some
 hedge
 funds
 where
 you're
 really
 not


allowed
 to
 talk
 to
 people
 from
 other


pods.
 Like
 I
 might
 say
 something
 to
 you,


Tracy,
 like
 I
 like
 the
 market
 here.
 I


don't
 like
 it
 here.
 But
 I
 would
 never


say,
 you
 know,
 I'm
 shorting
 the
 2-year


versus
 the
 three-year
 DVL1
 weighted


something
 specific.
 And
 that's
 to
 avoid


kind
 of
 crosscontamination
 of
 the
 pods.


Whereas
 there
 are
 others
 who
 really


value
 the
 Aspree
 decor
 and
 they
 like
 to


have
 people
 collaborate
 and
 those
 places


not
 only
 are
 you
 going
 to
 have
 the


typical
 meetings
 with
 BD
 and
 risk
 and


the
 CIO
 but
 you're
 also
 going
 to
 meet
 a


lot
 of
 other
 PMs
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 you


know
 you're
 not
 a
 jerk.
 Let's
 talk
 more


about
 getting
 a
 job
 as
 an
 analyst.
 There


are
 probably
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 maybe


they're
 in
 college
 listening
 to
 this


episode
 right
 now.
 I
 think
 that
 if
 I


were
 young
 and
 in
 college
 and
 didn't


have
 any
 obligations,
 I
 would
 like
 this


sounds
 really
 fun
 working
 for
 a
 multi


strategy
 hedge
 funds.
 I
 would
 love
 to


get
 my
 door
 in
 one,
 what
 would
 be
 like,


what
 should
 I
 do
 to
 get
 that
 first
 role?


There
 are
 a
 few
 firms
 that
 hire
 direct


from
 college,
 direct
 from
 university.


Those
 are
 very,
 very
 small
 programs.


Normally,
 there's
 only
 a
 few
 of
 them


that
 scale.
 I
 would
 say
 typically
 people


who
 first
 move
 into
 a
 pod
 as
 an
 analyst


or
 perhaps
 a
 subpm
 generally
 come
 from


the
 sell
 side,
 okay,
 or
 maybe
 prop,
 but


they
 generally
 have
 spent
 a
 couple
 of


years
 on
 the
 sell
 side,
 have
 a
 lot
 of


the
 great
 training
 that
 the
 street
 can


provide
 and
 have
 advanced
 themselves
 to


where
 they
 are
 saying,
 you
 know,
 I
 no


longer
 just
 want
 to
 make
 markets.
 I


actually
 want
 to
 trade
 my
 own
 risk.
 So


you
 get
 a
 job
 on
 the
 sell
 side
 and
 you


establish
 yourself
 as
 someone
 who
 knows


something
 who
 people
 like
 reading
 from


and
 who
 people
 like
 reading
 their,
 you


know,
 their
 takes
 and
 their
 models
 and


have
 interesting
 insights
 to
 say
 about


whatever
 asset
 class
 is
 being
 traded.


Either
 that
 or
 you
 have
 a
 business
 that


actually
 would
 work
 good
 on
 the
 buy
 side


and
 it
 just
 happens
 to
 be
 in
 the
 sell


side.
 But
 in
 terms
 of
 how
 you
 get
 that


first
 job,
 I
 would
 say
 be
 useful.
 think


that
 everybody
 is
 kind
 of
 concentrated


on
 the,
 you
 know,
 I
 want
 to
 be
 coming
 up


with
 the
 ideas
 that
 go
 into
 the
 book
 and


you
 sort
 of
 grow
 into
 that
 slowly.
 But


if
 you're
 somebody
 who,
 you
 know,
 has


read
 the
 history
 or
 done
 the
 work
 or


researched,
 you
 know,
 what
 happens
 when


on
 the
 first
 Fed
 cut,
 what
 happens
 on


the
 last,
 what
 happened
 in
 the
 dollar,


the
 last
 time
 we
 had
 tariffs,
 those


sorts
 of
 analoges
 in
 the
 macro
 world
 are


very
 good.
 If
 you
 understand


restructurings,
 you're
 probably
 going
 to


be
 pretty
 valuable
 to
 high
 yield
 or


distress
 pod.
 You're
 not
 going
 to
 get


that,
 you
 know,
 I've
 got
 the
 con
 kind
 of


job
 right
 away.
 So,
 you
 need
 to
 be


useful
 in
 the
 job
 you're
 applying
 for.


And
 then
 you
 kind
 of
 touched
 on
 this


before,
 but
 I
 would
 love
 to
 hear
 more.


What
 are
 the
 pools
 that
 multistrats
 are


actually
 drawing
 from?
 And
 have
 those


changed
 over
 time?
 like
 you
 know
 when


they
 first
 started
 popping
 up
 were
 they


hiring
 from
 fund
 of
 funds
 and
 the
 cell


side
 and
 then
 as
 they
 progress
 maybe
 get


a
 little
 bit
 more
 experimental
 and
 start


diversifying
 into
 other
 industries
 to


draw
 PMs
 from.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 for


instance,
 we've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 interest


in
 commodities
 PMs
 over
 the
 past
 few


years,
 and
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 are
 at
 trade


houses
 or
 perhaps
 they
 work
 for
 large


oil
 and
 gas
 companies,
 a
 lot
 of
 which


are
 really
 more
 engineering
 than


trading.
 They'll
 look
 anywhere
 if


there's
 sort
 of,
 you
 know,
 a
 definable


edge.
 And
 we
 were
 talking
 a
 little
 bit


about,
 you
 know,
 the
 process
 of


interviewing.
 Part
 of
 what
 somebody's


looking
 for
 is,
 you
 know,
 can
 we
 do
 what


you
 do?
 I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example.
 funds


really
 want
 to
 expand
 their
 balance


sheet
 and
 be
 as
 efficient
 with
 it
 as


possible.
 If
 we
 look
 at
 gross
 notional


exposure
 to
 net
 assets
 for
 multistrats,


we
 hovered
 around
 10
 10x
 through
 about


2020
 and
 since
 then
 now
 we're
 between
 14


and
 16
 and
 that's
 grossing
 assets
 up
 as


a
 multiple
 of
 their
 investable
 assets.


So
 that
 tells
 you
 they're
 looking
 for


things
 that
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 highly


leverable,


but
 any
 edge
 they
 they
 will
 look
 at.
 You


know,
 15
 years
 ago,
 no
 multistract


traded
 munis.
 Most
 all
 of
 them
 do
 now.


You
 know,
 there
 were
 certain
 businesses


like
 index
 rebound,
 things
 of
 that


nature,
 basis
 type
 trades
 that
 once
 were


the
 exclusive
 province
 of
 the
 street
 and


now
 because
 the
 ability
 of
 a
 lot
 of


these
 multistrats
 to
 effectively
 lose


use
 their
 balance
 sheet,
 they
 can
 engage


in
 those
 businesses.
 Right?
 This
 is
 one


of
 the
 themes
 that's
 come
 up
 is
 the
 sort


of
 like
 post
 DoddFrank
 era
 where
 a
 lot


of
 certain
 types
 of
 trades
 that
 used
 to


exist
 in-house
 at
 the
 major
 banks
 are


now
 have
 now
 effectively
 been
 outsourced


in
 some
 manner
 to
 buy
 side
 entities


where
 it's
 more
 appropriate
 to
 take


these
 risks.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 your
 time


when
 you
 were
 a
 PM.
 We
 talked
 about
 the


value
 of
 the
 seat
 and
 not
 getting
 fired.


And
 I
 also
 get
 the
 impression
 that
 on
 a


sort
 of
 day-to-day
 or
 week
 to
 week
 or


tradeto
 trade
 basis
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


constraints
 from
 the
 risk
 manager.
 Talk


about
 the
 incentives
 of
 the
 PM
 to


survive
 and
 make
 it
 to
 the
 next
 year
 or


make
 it
 to
 the
 next
 bonus
 season.
 I
 mean


you
 can
 essentially
 think
 of
 working
 for


a
 multistrat
 as
 you're
 running
 your
 own


business.
 Okay,
 you're
 sort
 of
 running


your
 own
 fund,
 but
 you
 only
 have
 one


client.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 make
 very
 sure


that
 that
 client's
 happy.
 Your


constraints
 are
 usually
 put
 in
 in
 you


know
 two
 terms.
 You'll
 often
 hear
 the


term
 capital
 thrown
 around.
 You
 know


Tracy
 manages
 700
 million
 at
 XYZ
 and
 Joe


has
 50
 million
 at
 ABC.
 That
 sort
 of


thing.
 The
 truth
 is
 those
 aren't
 really


easily
 comparable
 numbers,
 right?
 The


hedge
 fund
 itself
 is
 inherently


leveraged.
 They'll
 typically
 allocate


somewhere
 between
 three
 and
 four
 times


their
 notional
 value,
 maybe
 even
 more
 in


terms
 of
 allocations
 to
 traders.
 So
 if


you've
 got
 a
 billion
 dollars,
 you're


allocating
 out
 theoretically
 three
 or


four
 billion.
 But
 there
 are
 two
 numbers


that
 are
 going
 to
 matter
 a
 lot
 to
 a
 PM.


The
 first
 one
 is
 how
 much
 can
 I
 lose?


That's
 your
 draw
 down.
 And
 there
 are
 two


ways
 to
 measure
 that.
 Most
 hedge
 funds


are
 going
 to
 measure
 it
 on
 a
 peakto


trough
 basis.
 Meaning
 even
 if
 you're
 up


five,
 if
 you
 give
 back,
 suppose
 your


stop
 is
 seven.
 If
 you
 give
 back
 seven,


then
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 your
 draw
 down


even
 though
 you
 really
 weren't
 down
 from


zero
 much
 at
 all.
 The
 other
 way
 to


measure
 that
 is
 from
 zero
 from
 flat.
 So


you
 can
 actually
 be
 fired
 from
 one
 of


these
 places
 and
 be
 up
 money
 on
 the
 year


when
 it
 happens.
 You
 just
 gave
 back
 too


much
 of
 your
 sort
 of
 new
 money.
 So


actually
 explain
 that
 further.
 A
 why


would
 you
 fire
 someone
 who's
 managed


money
 profitably?
 But
 then
 here's


another
 related
 question
 to
 that
 is
 like


you
 hear
 about
 okay
 someone
 gets
 fired


from
 place
 X
 and
 then
 they
 go
 get
 a
 new


job
 at
 place
 Y.
 But
 if
 they're


objectively
 talented
 and
 maybe
 they're


not,
 but
 if
 by
 some
 measure
 it
 can
 be


established
 that
 they're
 talented,
 why


are
 the
 pods
 so
 quick
 to
 fire
 them?
 I


mean
 I
 get
 yeah
 you
 lose
 money
 that's


not
 good
 but
 if
 you
 know
 losing
 money


happens
 if
 the
 person
 has
 talent
 why
 the


quick
 fires
 it
 helps
 if
 you
 think
 of
 the


multistrat
 itself
 is
 managing
 a


portfolio
 themselves
 but
 it's
 a


portfolio
 of
 risk
 takers
 not
 to
 be


reductive
 but
 generally
 most
 of
 those


types
 of
 decisions
 are
 made
 on
 a
 fund
 by


fund
 basis
 in
 other
 words
 you
 know
 maybe


this
 person
 is
 not
 as
 uncorrelated
 to


what
 we
 have
 as
 we
 already
 thought
 they


are
 not
 really
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


They
 just
 exceeded
 their
 draw
 down


because
 it's
 not
 like
 they
 don't
 know


that
 it's
 a
 ge
 trough
 number.
 They're


perfectly
 aware
 of
 it.
 Or
 perhaps


there's
 another
 opportunity
 in
 the


market
 to
 replace
 them
 with
 someone


better.
 They're
 always
 looking
 to


optimize
 their
 portfolio
 of
 risk
 takers.


As
 far
 as
 the
 other
 firm,
 they
 could
 be


thinking,
 "This
 person
 does
 fit
 what
 we


need
 and
 we
 really
 like
 their
 risk


profile."
 Even
 a
 really
 great
 PM
 is


going
 to
 have
 a
 significant
 draw
 down


every
 two
 to
 five
 years.
 And
 there


aren't
 too
 many
 who've
 gone
 10
 plus


years
 with
 no
 losing
 years.
 You
 know,


you
 just
 don't
 want
 to
 be
 that
 person


who
 experiences
 that
 5%
 of
 the
 time
 draw


down
 in
 your
 first
 few
 months
 in
 a
 new


fund.
 I
 used
 to
 know
 a
 credit
 guy
 who


always
 said
 like
 you're
 not
 a
 proper


credit
 trader
 until
 you've
 had
 at
 least


one
 major
 blow
 up.


Maybe
 maybe
 that's
 true.
 But
 on
 this


note,
 okay,
 if
 I
 get
 a
 big
 draw
 down,
 I


understand
 maybe
 it
 it
 depends
 on
 where


I
 am
 with
 my
 career
 and
 if
 I
 get
 it
 in


the
 first
 6
 months
 of
 working
 at
 a
 shop,


that
 would
 be
 very
 bad.
 But
 if
 it's
 in,


you
 know,
 year
 six
 or
 something,
 maybe


it
 doesn't
 matter
 so
 much.
 But
 how


embarrassed
 am
 I
 when
 that
 happens?
 And


am
 I
 like
 publicly
 shamed
 within
 the


organization
 for
 this
 happening
 or
 how


does
 it
 work?
 Exactly.
 You
 know,
 it's


sort
 of
 funny
 because
 obviously
 we
 had
 a


a
 period
 just
 a
 few
 months
 back
 where


there
 were
 a
 lot
 of
 headlines
 about


large
 losses
 as
 the
 marketplace
 views


it.
 It's
 going
 to
 feel
 awful
 to
 the
 PM,


right?
 You
 never
 want
 to
 be
 on
 the


screen
 for
 a
 loss.
 But
 whenever
 you
 see


somebody
 up
 there
 with
 a
 hundred
 million


loss,
 that
 means
 they
 had
 a hundred


million
 to
 lose,
 which
 means
 that
 they


were
 managing
 a
 large
 book
 and
 they
 were


taking
 a
 lot
 of
 risk.
 And
 if
 you'll


notice,
 some
 of
 those
 PMs
 from
 a
 few


months
 ago
 are
 still
 exactly
 where
 they


were.
 You
 are
 really
 generally
 better


off
 getting
 bounced
 for
 a
 large
 loss


than
 you
 are
 a
 small
 one.
 This
 goes
 fits


with
 something
 one
 of
 my
 beliefs
 that
 a


billionaire
 is
 someone
 who
 either
 has


positive
 $1
 billion
 in
 net
 worth
 or


negative
 1
 billion
 in
 in
 one
 billion
 in


debt
 cuz
 you
 have
 to
 be
 like
 really
 rich


to
 have
 lost
 that
 much
 money.
 And


anytime
 you
 hear
 about
 like
 a
 former


billionaire
 and
 they
 lost
 everything,


they're
 almost
 always
 still
 somehow


living
 large.
 So
 being
 deeply
 deeply
 in


debt
 is
 almost
 as
 good
 as
 having
 tons
 of


money.
 So
 I'm
 glad
 to
 hear
 this.
 How


does
 that
 constrain
 your
 actual
 trading?


Okay,
 you
 know
 that
 draw
 down
 number,


you
 know,
 at
 the
 point
 where
 you're


going to
 get
 stopped
 out
 of
 the
 seat.


How
 does
 that
 actually
 translate
 into


thinking
 about
 the
 trades
 that
 you
 put


on?
 I
 hate
 to
 do
 an
 it
 depends
 but
 it


sort
 of
 depends
 on
 where
 you're
 at


because
 even
 though
 common
 draw
 down
 for


you
 know
 limits
 are
 usually
 somewhere


between
 seven
 and
 10%
 for
 what's
 called


a
 stopout
 you
 might
 end
 up
 getting
 your


capital
 reduced
 well
 before
 that
 at
 3


and
 a
 half
 or
 five
 and
 that
 makes
 it


really
 really
 hard
 to
 come
 back.
 The
 key


is,
 you
 know,
 do
 you
 have
 a
 process?
 Do


you
 have
 risk
 management
 and
 portfolio


construction
 where
 you
 are
 still


applying
 your
 risk
 management?
 I'm
 only


going
 to
 risk
 this
 much
 my
 risk
 capital.


What
 is
 between
 me
 and
 a
 capital


reduction
 or
 draw
 down?
 I'm
 going
 to
 be


pickier.
 I'm
 going
 to
 trade
 smaller.


There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 funds
 that
 have,
 you


know,
 internal
 coaches,
 psychologists


like
 this.
 Wendy
 Rhodess
 is
 based
 on


real
 people
 who
 do
 real
 things.
 And
 you


know,
 certain
 firms
 will
 sit
 you
 down


and
 talk
 to
 you
 or
 they'll
 make
 you
 take


a
 time
 out.
 Other
 firms
 will
 just
 say,


"That's
 it.
 You're
 out."
 But


psychologically,
 it
 makes
 you
 you
 want


to
 get
 it
 back,
 which
 is
 not
 a
 great


feeling
 because
 even
 when
 you
 get
 there,


you're
 just
 at
 flat.
 And
 it
 it
 really


impacts
 your
 risk-taking
 tolerance.
 I


think
 one
 of the
 best
 things
 that,
 you


know,
 I
 ever
 heard
 was
 if
 you're
 kind
 of


in
 a
 losing
 streak,
 just
 get
 flat
 and
 go


away.
 Don't
 keep
 any
 marginal
 things.


You
 can
 always
 buy
 it
 back
 later.
 You


can
 always
 sell
 it
 later,
 but
 get
 your


mind
 right.
 But
 it
 does
 negatively


affect
 you.
 And
 you
 you
 kind
 of
 skew


your
 thinking
 either
 to
 I'm
 going
 to


take
 more
 bets
 to
 get
 it
 back
 faster
 or


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 anything
 because
 I'm


going
 to
 be
 so
 picky.
 Overtrading
 is


really
 common.
 I'll
 give
 you
 for


example.
 People
 coming
 from
 the
 sell


side
 almost
 always
 overtrade
 when
 they


first
 get
 to
 the
 buy
 side.
 The
 reason
 is


trading
 has
 a
 positive
 expected
 value


for
 them.
 They
 are
 in
 the
 bid
 ask.
 Oh,


not
 only
 that,
 but
 facilitation
 desk
 on


the
 sell
 side,
 they
 lose
 money
 if
 V


explodes,
 but
 they
 generally
 make
 a
 lot


of
 more
 money
 after
 it
 subsides.
 The
 bid


ask
 widens
 out
 and
 they
 could
 collect
 a


lot
 of
 client
 flow
 in
 the
 back
 end
 of


that.
 One
 of
 the
 questions
 that
 I
 always


ask
 people
 is,
 you
 know,
 tell
 me
 about


your
 biggest
 draw
 down.
 What
 did
 hap


when
 was
 it?
 What
 was
 going
 on?
 What


happened?
 would
 you
 do?
 And
 the
 sell


side
 traders
 will
 always
 have
 very
 quick


times
 to
 recovery
 and
 they
 expected
 to


get
 it
 back.
 But
 that's
 not
 the
 positive


expected
 value
 you
 have
 on
 the
 buy
 side.


It
 cost
 you
 money
 to
 trade.


[Music]


Brian,
 tell
 me
 about
 your
 biggest
 draw


down
 and
 what
 it
 was
 and
 what
 you
 did.


Oh,
 well,
 my
 biggest
 draw
 down
 was


losing
 my
 job.
 I
 can't
 name
 numbers,
 but


essentially
 I
 violated
 my
 own
 risk.
 I


usually
 never
 speculated
 on
 outright


vault
 and
 I
 had
 a
 long
 ball
 position
 and


I
 normally
 would
 have
 structured
 that
 as


a
 spread
 and
 I
 didn't.
 And
 though
 I
 was


directionally
 right,
 I
 bought
 really


expensive
 wall
 and
 therefore
 didn't
 make


much
 money.
 Got
 hit
 on
 volatility
 and
 a


much
 larger
 fashion
 than
 I
 thought
 I


would.
 And
 I
 was
 in
 that
 camp
 of
 not
 a


big
 draw
 down
 and
 it
 was
 almost
 unreal


to
 people
 that
 I
 knew.
 Like
 why
 would


they
 let
 you
 go?
 Because
 there's
 not
 a


lot
 of
 verifiable
 information
 out
 there.


That
 always
 sounds
 very
 suspect
 to


people.
 I
 wish
 I
 could
 be
 more
 colorful


for
 that,
 but
 I
 can't.


That's
 really
 helpful.
 But
 on
 this
 note,


I'm
 also
 curious,
 do
 PMs
 ever
 go
 to
 like


risk
 managers
 or
 the
 people
 above
 them


and
 beg
 for
 like
 either
 more
 money
 or


more
 risk
 tolerance?
 Oh,
 absolutely.
 And


a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 firms
 actually
 have,


you
 know,
 programs
 where
 if
 you
 have


something
 that's
 really
 scalable
 that


you
 think
 is
 very
 functional,
 they
 may


give
 you
 sort
 of
 a
 side
 account
 and
 you


you
 get
 paid
 on
 that,
 but
 it's
 not
 part


of
 your
 regular
 book.
 Once
 you
 work
 in


BD,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 who
 you
 bring
 in


sort
 of
 ask
 you
 questions
 like,
 "Hey,
 I


want
 to
 do
 this.
 Who
 should
 I
 ask?
 When


should
 I
 ask?"
 And
 I
 generally
 tell
 PMS,


unless
 it's
 an
 actual
 trade
 idea,
 don't


just
 ask
 for
 more
 capital.
 Unless
 it's


one
 of
 two
 situations.
 Number
 one,
 you


just
 got
 there
 because
 they
 love
 you.


You
 haven't
 done
 anything
 wrong
 and
 they


just
 probably
 paid
 up
 to
 get
 you.
 Number


two,
 you've
 just
 made
 a hundred
 million


bucks.
 Other
 than
 those
 two
 situations,


don't
 ask
 for
 things.
 Wait,
 let's
 talk


more
 about
 violating
 your
 own
 risk
 book.


There's
 a
 famous
 story
 from
 Stan
 Ducken


Miller
 where
 he
 apparently
 like
 bought


the
 very
 top
 of
 the
 internet
 bubble
 and


he
 says,
 "You
 ask
 me
 what
 I
 learned.
 I


didn't
 learn
 anything.
 I
 already
 knew


that
 I
 wasn't
 supposed
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 was


just
 an
 emotional
 basket
 case
 and


couldn't
 help
 myself.
 So
 maybe
 I
 learned


not
 to
 do
 it
 again,
 but
 I
 already
 knew


that."
 When
 a
 fund
 manager
 is
 sort
 of


like
 violate
 or
 a
 PM
 is
 violating
 some


of
 their
 own
 things,
 do
 they
 know
 it?
 Do


they
 feel
 differently?
 Do
 they
 get
 like


some
 sort
 of
 acidic
 taste
 in
 their


mouth?
 When
 I
 like
 go
 on
 tilt
 when
 I


play
 poker,
 I
 always
 sort
 of
 know
 it,


but
 I
 can't
 help
 myself
 anyway.
 Like
 I


just
 do
 it
 and
 I
 go
 all
 in
 and
 I
 know


ahead
 and
 then
 I
 have
 to
 embarrassingly


walk
 out
 of
 the
 table.
 Like
 what
 does


that
 feel
 like?
 Talk
 about
 like
 what's


going
 on
 in
 someone's
 brain
 when
 they're


like
 taking
 these
 risks
 that
 on
 paper


they
 shouldn't
 be.
 Well,
 usually
 you


only
 recognize
 it
 in
 the
 rear
 view.
 If


you
 slow
 down
 and
 think
 through
 the


trade,
 you
 know,
 you
 sort
 of
 realize


that,
 hey,
 you
 probably
 shouldn't
 do


this.
 But
 I
 think
 you're
 paralleled
 with


being
 on
 tilt
 at
 a
 poker
 table.
 It's


it's
 that
 knowledge,
 you
 know,
 after
 you


call
 somebody
 or
 after
 you
 raise
 that


instant
 feeling
 that,
 man,
 I
 just
 leaped


up.
 It's
 that
 feeling
 only
 you're
 going


to
 feel
 it
 for
 a
 few
 days
 and
 you're


going
 to
 get
 a
 little
 email
 or
 call
 from


your
 risk
 manager
 and
 then
 you're
 not


going
 to
 know
 what
 that
 sit
 down's
 going


to
 be
 like.
 It
 might
 be,
 hey,
 no
 big


deal.
 Get
 back
 out
 there.
 You
 know,


don't
 worry
 about
 it.
 It
 may
 be
 an


entirely
 different
 conversation.
 You
 may


be
 told,
 "Go
 to
 HR.
 Don't
 take
 your


jacket."
 Huh?
 Or
 take
 your
 jacket,
 I


should
 say.
 But
 it
 isn't
 a
 bad
 feeling.


And
 I
 think
 some
 of
 the
 better
 mentors


that
 I've
 had
 through
 the
 years
 have


kind
 of
 taught
 me
 like
 that
 mental


health
 thing
 and
 where
 you're
 at
 is
 is


very
 important.
 And
 I
 think
 it's
 even


worse
 when
 you're
 at
 a
 a
 multistrat
 or
 a


situation
 where
 you
 have
 a
 a
 single


client.
 That's
 it.
 If
 that
 one
 client


isn't
 happy,
 you
 are
 probably
 out
 for
 at


least
 6
 months
 and
 potentially
 much


longer.
 The
 BD
 process
 to
 bring
 a
 new
 PM


on
 board
 is
 somewhere
 around
 3
 months
 on


its
 own.
 Do
 you
 do
 postmortems
 on


winning
 and
 losing
 trades?
 Kind
 of,
 you


know,
 like
 after
 forget
 talk
 about


poker,
 you
 go
 back
 and
 you
 run
 the
 poker


hand
 through
 a
 solver
 and
 you
 see
 if
 you


played
 it
 correctly
 often
 whether
 you


made
 money
 or
 lose
 money.
 Is
 there
 an


equivalent
 process
 that's
 done
 in
 the


trading
 world?
 100%.
 As
 a
 matter
 of


fact,
 if
 you
 guys
 have
 never
 had
 Brent


Donnelly
 on,
 uh,
 he
 wrote
 a
 book
 called


Alpha
 Trader,
 and
 I've
 probably
 never


seen
 that
 information
 written
 down
 in


one
 place
 before,
 but
 it's
 fantastic.


Yeah,
 we
 should
 have
 him
 back
 on
 or


something
 to
 talk
 about
 just
 now.
 But


keep
 tell
 us
 more
 about
 it
 from
 your


perspective.
 Yes,
 you
 know
 and
 and
 that


is
 part
 of
 the
 other
 process
 like
 we


mentioned
 edge
 like
 the
 other
 parts
 of


the
 beauty
 process.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 the


process
 by
 which
 somebody
 selects


trades.
 I
 want
 to
 know
 about
 their


portfolio
 construction
 and
 I
 want
 to


know
 their
 approach
 to
 risk
 especially


on
 risk.
 You'll
 find
 that
 very
 good
 PMs


and
 especially
 these
 firms,
 the
 firms


themselves,
 even
 though
 the
 PM
 may
 not


see
 it,
 they
 know
 exactly
 how
 many
 bets


you've
 taken,
 they
 know
 about
 your
 hit


rate,
 they
 understand
 your
 skew,
 they


can
 sort
 of
 tell
 when
 you're
 deviating


from
 your
 risk
 mandate.
 They
 have
 a
 lot


of
 analytics,
 but
 it's
 been
 my


experience
 that
 the
 best
 PMs
 look
 at
 it


themselves.
 They're
 almost
 religious


with
 it.
 You
 know,
 how
 did
 I
 do
 today?


It's
 very
 similar
 to
 an
 athlete
 watching


tape
 or
 or
 a
 dancer.
 My
 daughter's
 loves


dance.
 You
 know,
 she'll
 watch
 tape
 of


herself.
 This
 is
 what
 I
 missed.
 This
 is


what
 I
 didn't
 do.
 And
 the
 great
 benefit


of
 doing
 it
 in
 a
 statistical
 fashion
 is


you
 can
 remove,
 oh,
 I
 won't
 count
 that


because
 it
 was
 a
 Tuesday
 and
 a
 full


moon.
 Any
 excuse
 you
 have
 goes
 out
 the


window.
 Those
 are
 the
 numbers.


On
 this
 note,
 and
 since
 Joe
 brought
 up


poker
 earlier,
 are
 there
 like
 popular


ways
 to
 become
 a
 better
 better
 does
 that


work
 for
 audio?
 better
 a
 better
 better


and
 and
 I'm
 thinking
 you
 know
 I'm


thinking
 back
 to
 Liars
 Poker
 that's
 a


famous
 example
 and
 then
 wasn't
 there


something
 at
 Jane
 Street
 that
 Sam


Bankman
 Freed
 was
 doing
 a
 bunch
 of


different
 like
 gambling
 games
 like
 that


yeah
 like
 what
 is
 popular
 in
 terms
 of
 I


guess
 building
 up
 your
 risk
 return


muscle
 well
 I
 think
 anything
 where
 you


have
 some
 element
 of
 strategy
 and
 I


think
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 that
 poker
 is


so
 popular
 is
 that
 it
 combines
 not
 only


strict
 strategy
 like
 you
 might
 see
 in


chess,
 but
 also
 a
 fair
 degree
 of


complete
 randomness.
 And
 you're
 going
 to


take
 some
 bad
 beats
 and
 that's
 going
 to


happen
 in
 trading.
 It's
 easy
 to
 forget,


but
 a
 really
 good
 PM
 might
 have
 a
 52
 53%


hit
 rate
 on
 their
 trades.
 It
 becomes


what
 their
 skew
 is,
 how
 much
 they
 make


on
 their
 winners
 versus
 how
 much
 they


lose
 on
 their
 losers.
 So,
 anything
 where


you're
 actually
 becoming
 more
 in
 tune
 to


your
 own
 risk-taking,
 your
 ability
 to


think
 in
 what
 you
 know,
 most
 people
 call


probabilistic
 terms
 or
 thinking
 in
 bets


after
 the
 Eddie
 Duke
 book,
 any
 exercise


like
 that.
 And
 I
 think
 poker
 is
 probably


just
 the
 most
 popular.
 It's
 also
 a
 great


fun
 I
 don't
 know
 whether
 I'd
 say
 team


building
 game,
 but
 it's
 a
 fun
 social


game
 that
 people
 play
 often
 around
 hedge


funds
 and
 it
 it
 fits
 with
 the
 gambling


mentality.
 So,
 we
 hear
 about
 it
 a
 lot,


but
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 different


internal
 games
 that
 people
 uh
 engage
 in.


I
 just
 have
 one
 last
 question
 and
 it


goes
 back
 to
 the
 role
 of
 the
 analyst
 and


you
 mentioned,
 oh,
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 an


analyst
 could
 be
 valuable
 if
 they
 really


know
 the
 history
 of
 what
 happens
 if


they're
 X
 or
 Y.
 I
 could
 just
 look
 that


up
 on
 03
 on
 Chad
 GPT
 or
 Perplexity
 these


days.
 Like
 how
 realistic
 is
 it
 in
 your


view
 that
 firms
 could
 meaningfully


reduce
 analyst
 headcount
 by
 using


artificial
 intelligence
 or
 if
 they
 save


money
 on
 by
 using
 artificial


intelligence
 would
 that
 just
 create
 new


roles
 for
 more
 sort
 of
 advanced


research?
 Like
 where
 we
 at
 with
 this?


You
 must
 talk
 to
 people
 uh
 about
 what


what
 they're
 doing
 with
 this.
 I
 think


there's
 lots
 of
 things
 they
 can
 do
 and


obviously
 you
 know
 you're
 talking
 about


pretty
 secretive
 organizations.
 So


there's
 an
 enterprise
 sharing
 issue


there
 to
 deal
 with,
 but
 yeah,
 a
 lot
 of


things
 could
 be
 really
 computerized,
 but


you're
 also
 looking
 for
 people
 who
 are


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 tie
 the
 story
 and


the
 narrative
 in
 with
 what
 was
 going
 on


with
 the
 instruments.
 And
 it's
 probably


not
 something
 so
 simple
 as,
 you
 know,


what
 did
 the
 dollar
 yen
 do
 the
 last
 time


the
 Fed
 hiked.
 It
 might
 be
 something


more
 like
 what
 was
 a
 reds
 greens
 puts


foot puts
 steepener
 doing
 the
 last
 time


the
 Fed
 hiked
 which
 you're
 going
 to


require
 a
 lot
 of
 modifications
 to
 those


AI
 models.
 I'm
 always
 hesitant
 to
 talk


about
 this
 because
 I
 can
 remember
 we


were
 told
 that
 all
 the
 paper
 companies


were
 going
 to
 go
 out
 of
 business
 because


everybody
 was
 going
 to
 read
 everything


online
 and
 what
 happened?
 We
 just
 all


printed
 it.
 Oh
 yeah,
 that's
 true.
 So
 and


they
 and
 they
 a
 lot
 of
 them
 also
 sell


cardboard
 boxes
 and
 so
 they
 they


benefited
 from
 e-commerce.
 those
 same


companies
 actually.
 Absolutely.
 Georgia


Pacific
 is
 is
 probably
 huge
 in
 in


Amazon's
 warehouse.
 But
 I
 think
 that


there
 will
 always
 be
 people
 who
 because


this
 industry
 thrives
 on,
 you
 know,
 I


can
 do
 this
 even
 though
 the
 odds
 are


very
 much
 against
 me.
 Uh
 and
 they
 will


definitely
 use
 any
 edge
 they
 can


getformationally
 as
 far
 as
 analytics
 or


anything
 like
 that.
 But
 usually
 there's


something
 that
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 to


ask
 that
 maybe
 not
 everybody
 understands


or
 knows.
 I
 think
 everybody
 who's
 in


this
 business
 got
 into
 it
 in
 one
 way
 or


another
 and
 somebody
 handed
 them
 what
 I


just
 generically
 call,
 you
 know,
 street


porn,
 which
 is
 the
 market
 wizards
 books


or
 any
 of
 those
 types
 of
 things.
 And


they're
 fantastic
 because
 what
 I
 got
 out


of
 reading
 those
 types
 of
 books
 is


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 ways
 to
 make


money.
 You
 just
 have
 to
 find
 out
 what


you're
 good
 at
 and
 how
 you
 can
 apply


your
 particular
 set
 of
 skills
 and


attributes
 to
 doing
 it.
 And
 I
 think
 that


there's
 going
 to
 be
 somebody
 who
 gets


really
 good
 at
 asking,
 you
 know,
 one
 of


these
 AI
 models
 market
 questions
 and


that
 person
 is
 going
 to
 get
 built
 up.


We're
 already
 seeing
 inquiries
 for
 heads


of
 AI
 at
 several
 different
 funds
 and
 I


think
 that
 that's
 going
 to
 continue
 as


they
 explore
 more
 and
 more,
 you
 know,


what
 they
 can
 actually
 do
 with
 it.
 they


have
 no
 problem
 spending
 money
 on
 the


either
 the
 AI
 or
 the
 human
 being.
 It


will
 ultimately
 come
 up
 to
 who
 can


perform.


So
 how
 do
 you
 avoid
 I
 guess
 group
 think


among
 your
 PMs
 because
 the
 whole
 point


of
 multistrats
 is
 those
 uncorrelated


returns
 and
 you
 don't
 want
 everyone
 just


putting
 on
 the
 same
 trades
 either


literally
 or
 maybe
 through
 another


angle.
 And
 I'm
 thinking
 specifically


about
 journalism.
 So,
 some
 newspapers


used
 to
 always
 move
 reporters
 from
 a


certain
 beat
 after
 they'd
 been
 there
 for


like
 10
 years
 or
 something.
 And
 the
 idea


was
 just
 to
 shake
 it
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 and


make
 sure
 that
 they're
 not
 getting
 like


too
 cozy
 or
 too
 comfortable
 with
 that


particular
 industry.
 The
 downside
 of


doing
 that,
 of
 course,
 is
 that
 you
 lose


expertise.


But
 I'm
 just
 wondering
 like
 how
 do


people
 Yeah.
 How
 do
 people
 avoid
 that


group
 think
 aspect
 and
 make
 sure
 that


everyone's
 doing,
 you
 know,
 new
 stuff


kind
 of
 independently?
 Well,
 one
 way
 is


limiting
 the
 communication
 between
 the


pods.
 Some
 places
 do
 not
 really
 allow


their
 pods
 to
 communicate.
 Another
 way


is
 basically
 structurally
 you
 you
 don't


want
 to
 see
 people
 hang
 on
 to
 each


other's
 trades.
 You're
 going
 to
 be


looking
 at
 this
 from,
 you
 know,
 a
 macro


view
 within
 the
 firm.
 you're
 going
 to


see
 this
 type
 of
 trade
 that
 this
 person


had
 on
 is
 increasing
 in
 size
 in
 the


firm.
 But
 by
 and
 large,
 if
 you've
 hired


right,
 you're
 going
 to
 hire
 independent


thinkers
 and
 a
 seasoned
 PM
 will
 tell


you,
 I
 might
 like
 somebody
 else's
 idea,


but
 I
 can't
 really
 trade
 it
 properly,


unless
 it's
 my
 idea,
 too.
 I
 kind
 of
 have


to
 adopt
 that
 as
 my
 own.
 So,
 group
 think


is
 not
 as
 prevalent
 as
 you
 would
 think


because
 it's
 structurally
 prohibited
 in


some
 places.
 in
 the
 places
 where
 it's


not,
 you
 know,
 a
 seasoned
 PM
 is
 like,


hey,
 I
 may
 love
 that
 trade
 that
 you


pitched
 me,
 Joe,
 but
 it
 that's
 yours.


And
 I
 can't
 I'm
 not
 doing
 my
 job
 if
 I


say,
 Joe,
 when
 are
 we
 getting
 out
 of


this?
 That's
 not
 what
 I'm
 paid
 to
 do.


Um,
 so
 part
 of
 it
 is
 on
 the
 part
 of
 the


PM
 internally,
 and
 then
 the
 other
 part


of
 it
 is
 on
 the
 fact
 that
 they
 don't


want
 to
 be
 seen
 as
 copying
 the
 next


guy's
 trades.
 All
 right,
 but
 just
 real


quickly,
 you
 maybe
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 do


group
 think
 or
 copy
 the
 next
 guy's


trades,
 but
 if
 there's
 a
 hot
 beta,


right?
 You're
 always
 looking
 for
 alpha,


but
 if
 there's
 a
 hot
 beta
 like
 AI
 beta


or
 whatever,
 or
 falling
 inflation
 beta,


like
 some
 of
 these
 long-term
 trends,
 but


that's
 not
 your
 thing.
 Do
 PMs
 find
 ways


to
 backdoor
 their
 asset
 class
 into
 the


hot
 trade
 in
 a
 way
 that
 like
 may
 de


facto
 become
 trade
 crowding?
 Yeah,
 a


former
 boss
 of
 mine
 used
 to
 say,


"There's
 never
 been
 a
 riskmanagement


framework
 that
 a
 smart
 trader
 couldn't


outwit."
 That's
 what
 I'm
 wondering.


That's
 like,
 is
 it
 this
 cat-and-
 mouse


game
 where
 you're
 in
 part
 trying
 to


outwit
 the
 person
 who
 could
 tap
 you
 on


the
 shoulder
 by
 trading
 something
 that


looks
 like
 something
 else?
 Yeah,
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 downside
 to
 doing
 that,
 you


know,
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 trade
 kind
 of


properly
 thought
 out.
 But,
 you
 know,
 in


general,
 if
 if
 I
 hire
 one
 of
 you
 to


trade
 credit
 and
 the
 other
 one
 to
 trade


the
 front
 end
 of
 the
 yield
 curve
 and,


you
 know,
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 Brazil
 is
 very


hot,
 the
 the
 real
 and
 you're
 both
 asking


me
 for
 limits
 on
 the
 real,
 like,
 you


won't
 have
 limits
 in
 something
 that
 you


don't
 already
 trade.
 Okay.
 So,
 you
 can't


really
 deviate
 from
 your
 mandate
 too


much.
 It's
 kind
 of
 I'll
 just
 find
 a


credit
 spread
 that's
 correlated
 with
 the


rail.
 Seriously.
 Yeah.
 or
 or
 you
 know


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 ETFs
 that
 basically


contain
 macro
 trades
 if
 you
 will
 and
 I


I've
 often
 wondered
 you
 know
 are
 those


there
 so
 that
 mutual
 fund
 managers
 can


you
 know
 and
 investing
 in
 equities
 can


speculate
 on
 the
 yield
 curve
 but
 there


are
 always
 ways
 to
 do
 it
 you
 just
 have


to
 kind
 of
 hire
 the
 right
 people
 who


aren't
 necessarily
 going
 to
 do
 that
 and


if
 you
 get
 in
 trouble
 for
 something
 like


that
 I
 sort
 of
 like
 to
 say
 that
 this
 is


the
 second
 most
 bureristic
 industry
 in


in
 America


word
 gets
 out
 as
 as
 large
 of
 an
 industry


it
 is,
 it's
 not
 that
 big
 and
 in


individual
 areas
 and
 if
 somebody
 has


really
 done
 something
 unourred,
 then


it's
 people
 are
 going
 to
 hear
 about
 it.


Brian
 Yelington,
 thank
 you
 for
 coming
 on


OddLots
 and
 talking
 about
 getting
 and


keeping
 multistrat
 jobs.
 Our
 journey


continues.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much.
 Really


appreciate
 uh
 chatting
 with
 you.
 Thank


you.
 Thank
 you
 for
 having
 me.
 It's
 great


to
 get
 to
 talk
 to
 you
 guys.


[Music]


Tracy,
 if
 I
 were
 like
 young,
 I
 think
 I


or
 if
 I
 were
 in
 college
 or
 something,
 I


think
 I
 would
 have
 taken
 that
 trading


job
 now.
 I
 mean,
 I
 like
 the
 way
 my


direction
 life
 direction
 went,
 but
 if
 I


like
 wanted
 to
 do
 over,
 I
 I'm
 curious


what
 that
 fork
 in
 the
 road
 looks
 like.


There'd
 be
 no
 odd
 thoughts.
 That's
 so


sad.
 It'
 be
 a
 different
 part,
 you
 know,


like
 there
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 I
 I
 would
 I


would
 trade.
 You
 know
 what
 would
 happen?


There
 would
 still
 be
 an
 odd
 lots.
 I


would
 trade
 for
 a
 while.
 I
 would
 blow


up.
 I
 would
 get
 a
 job
 in
 journalism.
 And


then
 I
 would
 be
 one
 of
 those
 journalists


who
 reminds
 all
 of
 their
 colleagues
 all


the
 times
 that
 they
 used
 to
 work
 in


finance.
 I
 would
 be
 like
 the
 person
 on


the
 call.
 They're
 like,
 I
 just
 love
 the,


you
 know,
 it's
 like
 I
 was
 like,
 oh,
 I
 I


used
 to
 work
 at
 a
 multi
 strategy
 hedge


fund.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 used
 to


be
 a
 trader.
 Anyway,
 sorry.
 Keep
 going.


Joe,
 how
 many
 times
 have
 you
 brought
 up


that
 interview
 with
 the
 trading
 company?


on
 this
 note.
 Okay,
 that
 was
 really


interesting.
 One
 thing
 that
 kind
 of


jumps
 out
 at
 me
 is
 the
 last
 discussion


about,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 you
 avoid


everyone
 just
 taking
 on
 the
 same
 risk?


It
 really
 seems
 to
 me
 like
 it's


correlation
 built
 on
 correlation
 built


on
 correlation,
 right?
 And
 I
 often
 think


correlation
 is
 one
 of
 the
 hardest
 things


to
 actually
 nail
 down
 on
 Wall
 Street.


So,
 you
 know,
 you
 got
 to
 wonder.
 So
 far,


so
 far,
 you
 know,
 a
 bunch
 of
 multistrats


survived
 um
 April
 pretty
 well.
 Yeah.
 So,


I
 guess
 we'll
 see.
 I
 think
 if
 I
 were
 a


risk
 manager
 and
 I
 had
 one
 person


trading
 credit
 and
 the
 other
 person


trading
 the
 short
 end
 of
 the
 yield
 curve


and
 suddenly
 their
 month-to-month
 return


started
 looking
 identical
 and
 it


happened
 to
 be
 identical
 with
 the
 person


who
 traded
 Brazilian
 Royale,
 that
 would


set
 off
 a
 red
 flag
 for
 me,
 you
 know,


like
 I
 feel
 like
 the
 return
 profile


itself
 is
 probably
 part
 of
 the
 hint,


right?
 that
 even
 if
 you
 can't
 really


articulate
 why
 this
 person's
 trade
 is


secretly
 this
 person's
 trade
 in


disguise,
 if
 their
 return
 profile
 looks


too
 similar,
 that
 probably
 it
 sets
 off


some
 red
 flags.
 We
 got
 to
 talk
 to
 a
 risk


manager,
 don't
 we?
 Yeah,
 we
 should
 do


that.
 Okay.
 If
 you're
 a
 risk
 manager,


you
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 what
 that
 job
 is


like.
 Or
 if
 you
 know
 one,
 shoot
 us
 a


message.
 All right.
 Shall
 we
 leave
 it


there?
 Let's

 it
