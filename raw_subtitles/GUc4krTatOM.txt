Hi
 everybody.
 I'm
 Nicolola
 Tangian
 the


CEO
 of
 the
 Norwegian
 S1
 wealth
 fund
 and


today
 I'm
 really
 happy
 because
 I'm
 here


with
 Mala
 Gong
 Carr
 who
 I've
 known
 for
 a


long
 time
 actually.
 Mala
 founded
 Sergo


Cap
 with
 $1.8
 billion
 and
 now
 it's
 at
 $6


billion
 and
 before
 that
 she
 spent
 23


years
 as
 a
 founding
 partner
 of
 Lone
 Pine


Capital,
 one
 of
 the
 most
 successful


hedge
 funds
 of
 all
 times.
 Great
 to
 have


you
 here.


>> Great
 to
 be
 here
 Nikolai.
 Thank
 you.


Tell
 me
 about
 Sergio
 Cap
 partners
 your


company.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 Serbo
 Cap
 tries
 to
 do
 what
 many


investment
 firms
 try
 to
 do.
 It
 tries
 to


beat
 the
 market
 uh
 over
 a
 3
 to
 5
 year


cycle
 with
 less
 risk
 than
 the
 market.


Risk
 defined
 as
 loss
 of
 capital,
 not


volatility.
 Uh
 and
 the
 way
 we
 try
 to


achieve
 that
 is
 by
 identifying
 this
 very


small
 handful
 of
 truly
 great
 businesses


that
 exist
 in
 the
 world.
 uh
 and
 we
 do


that
 through
 a
 our
 product
 is
 really
 our


process
 a
 very
 transparent
 process
 of
 uh


looking
 for
 very
 specific
 factors
 that


really
 are
 distillation
 as
 you
 pointed


out
 earlier
 of
 my
 lessons
 I've
 learned


the
 many
 mistakes
 and
 lessons
 I've


learned
 uh
 from
 investing
 over
 23
 years


with
 some
 of the
 best
 uh
 people
 in
 the


business
 my
 former
 colleagues
 at
 at


Lumpine
 and
 so
 that
 distillation
 has
 led


to
 sero
 there
 are
 many
 different
 factors


that
 lead
 to
 identification
 of
 a
 truly


brilliant
 business
 but
 The
 way
 I
 define


a
 great
 business
 is
 a
 business
 with
 very


long
 duration
 modes
 and
 duration
 really


is
 our
 true
 differentiation.


>> So
 mode
 being
 that
 it's
 difficult
 to


compete
 with
 them.
 It's
 difficult
 to


compete
 amount.
 How
 many
 great
 companies


are
 there
 in
 the
 world?


>> As
 I
 said,
 a
 small
 handful.
 I
 don't


think
 there
 are
 that
 many.
 We
 focus
 on


really
 four
 verticals
 where
 I
 think


there
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 an
 edge
 uh
 from
 a
 one


very
 specific
 factor.
 So
 one
 back
 to
 the


experience
 of
 what
 I've
 seen
 over
 24
 now


30
 years
 of
 investing
 is
 techn
 every


business
 is
 a
 technology
 business
 right


so
 if
 you're
 an
 aerospace
 company
 or
 a


medtech
 business
 or
 a
 financial
 data


business
 you
 are
 a
 technology
 company
 in


your
 backbone
 if
 you
 want
 to
 deliver
 at


scale
 and
 with
 quality
 you
 have
 to
 be
 a


tech
 business
 and
 I
 think
 understanding


the
 tech
 stack
 map
 of
 businesses
 is


something
 we
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on


especially
 in
 nontech
 businesses
 um
 I


think
 that's
 one
 the
 second
 is
 how
 old


technologies
 can
 disrupt
 in
 very
 new


ways
 So
 if
 you
 think
 about
 something


like
 we've
 talked
 about
 this
 but
 the


auto
 industry
 which
 employs
 far
 more


people
 in
 the
 tech
 industry
 but
 it's


being
 disrupted
 right
 now
 by
 you
 know


technology
 that
 was
 invented
 in
 1976
 you


know
 the
 uh
 the
 the
 lithium
 ion
 battery.


So
 I
 think
 that
 is
 that's
 always


interesting
 to
 me
 or
 you
 know
 in
 when


you
 know
 we
 started
 investing
 career
 we


were
 buying
 GPUs
 to
 you
 know
 make
 our


video
 games
 look
 a
 little
 little little


more
 fun
 and
 then
 fast
 forward
 to
 now


they're
 actually
 driving
 what's
 probably


one
 of the
 more
 tectonic
 plate
 shifts
 in


terms
 of
 you
 know
 social
 and
 demographic


and
 technology
 shifts
 of
 our
 time
 which


is
 AI.
 So
 I
 think
 how
 old
 technologies


disrupt
 in
 new
 ways
 and
 looking
 for
 that


in
 non-
 tech
 businesses
 is
 something
 we


spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 as
 well


>> and
 we'll
 come
 back
 to
 this
 but
 just


when
 you
 set
 up
 the
 fund
 what
 kind
 of


self-imposed
 constraints
 do
 you
 did
 you


put


>> yes
 so
 I
 in
 order
 to
 distill
 to
 your


question
 about
 how
 we
 identify
 these


truly
 great
 business
 and
 keeping
 that


discipline
 there
 are a
 couple
 ways
 of
 of


doing
 that
 um
 one
 is
 focus
 so
 we
 decided


I
 wanted
 to
 keep
 the
 team
 small
 uh
 if


there's
 a
 consistent
 piece
 of
 advice
 I


got
 from
 CEOs
 many
 have
 been
 on
 this
 uh


podcast
 with
 you
 whether
 they're
 running


huge
 companies
 or
 small
 businesses
 or


founders
 was
 to
 keep
 the
 team
 size


small.
 So
 it's
 not
 just
 about
 aum
 it's


obviously
 it's
 easier
 to
 multiply
 a


dollar
 than
 it
 is
 to
 multiply
 a
 billion


dollars
 but
 team
 size
 and
 keeping
 team


size
 small
 and
 making
 sure
 that


collaborative
 and
 crossber
 thinking


which
 is
 so
 fruitful
 for
 new
 idea


generation
 particularly
 creative
 idea


generation
 that
 was
 paramount
 in
 my


brain.


>> How
 small
 is
 small?
 Um
 we
 have
 an


investment
 team
 including
 the
 data


science
 team
 and
 that
 we
 regularly
 meet


table
 this
 size
 uh
 so
 that
 we
 can
 have
 a


roundt
 discussion.
 Um
 you
 know
 Jeff


Bezos
 has
 talked
 about
 sort
 of
 two
 two


pizza
 box
 teams.
 I
 think
 we'd
 like
 to


stay
 at
 one
 pizza
 box
 uh
 in
 terms
 of
 our


our
 team
 size.


>> One
 pizza
 box
 pizza
 per
 person
 I
 have
 to


say.


>> Yeah
 exactly.
 We
 keep
 things
 lean.


>> I'm
 saying
 that
 as
 a
 Norwegian
 we
 are


the
 biggest
 pizza
 eating
 uh
 country
 in


the
 world.
 11
 kilo
 per
 person


supposedly.


>> Is
 that
 right?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 Interesting.
 I've
 never
 predicted


that.


>> But
 when
 you
 look
 at
 when
 you
 look
 at


your
 company
 relative
 to
 other
 tech


investors,
 what
 would
 you
 say
 is
 the


difference?


>> We're
 looking
 at
 where
 techn
 is


intersecting
 with
 non-technology


businesses
 and
 where,
 as
 I
 said,
 old


technology
 is
 disrupting
 uh
 in
 new
 ways.


Uh
 so
 that's
 one
 angle.
 We
 look
 at
 the


the
 usual
 checklist
 of
 competitive
 and


customer
 and
 other
 checks.
 I
 would
 say


the
 other
 big
 lesson
 is
 really
 around


biases
 and
 how
 you
 can
 use
 data
 science


today
 in
 a
 way
 we
 couldn't
 when
 we


started
 our
 investment
 careers.
 uh
 given


how
 fast
 and
 how
 open
 source
 now
 machine


learning
 is,
 you
 can
 very


cost-effectively
 create
 uh
 very
 strong


uh
 third-party
 data
 checks
 uh
 including


automated
 surveys
 um
 including
 you
 know


automated
 tracking
 uh
 of
 various
 data


points
 around
 markets
 and
 tech
 adoption


that
 we
 could
 not
 very
 early
 on
 in
 the


you
 know
 the
 late
 90s
 when
 we're
 setting


up
 our
 careers.


>> Give
 me
 an
 example
 on
 the
 kind
 of
 thing


you
 can
 do
 now
 that
 you
 couldn't
 do


earlier.
 Um
 so
 very
 specifically
 if
 you


want
 to
 track
 sort
 of
 product
 adoption


when
 we
 started
 out
 you
 know
 when
 we


started
 lumpine
 98
 when
 I
 was
 looking
 at


uh
 some
 of
 the
 early
 adoptions
 even
 say


around
 Adobe
 products
 back
 in
 the
 day


when
 they
 were
 just
 transitioning
 to


cloud
 that
 was
 a
 very
 manual
 process.


You
 went
 out
 you
 called
 customers
 you


did
 surveys
 surveys
 were
 usually
 done
 by


phone
 response
 rates
 were
 trickier
 to


track.
 Um
 now
 we
 actually
 can
 use
 survey


bots
 to
 do
 these
 things.
 We
 can
 actually


have
 a
 combination
 of
 both
 uh
 augmented


human
 surveyors
 as
 well
 as
 looking
 at


some
 of
 the
 deeper
 dives.
 We
 can
 track


through
 machine
 learning
 in
 a
 very


automated
 way
 a
 larger
 number
 of
 product


SKs.
 We
 can
 scrape
 the
 web
 which
 to
 be


clear
 wasn't
 at
 the
 scale
 and
 scope
 of


what
 it
 is
 today
 to
 see
 product


adoptions
 to
 see
 who
 has
 open
 APIs
 to


their
 suppliers
 who
 doesn't.
 Um
 so


there's
 a
 whole
 range
 of
 both
 techstack


mapping,
 product
 adoption,
 customer


adoption
 even
 outside
 the
 typical


consumer
 adoption
 data
 that
 is
 tracked


uh
 pretty
 religiously
 now
 as
 you
 know


within
 the
 consumer
 world.


>> Do
 you
 think
 investment
 organizations


will
 be
 smaller
 in
 the
 future?


>> I
 suspect
 they
 will
 be
 and
 they
 probably


should
 be
 because
 I
 do
 think
 there
 is


something
 about
 human
 collaboration
 that


works
 best
 at
 a
 smaller
 scale.
 I
 think


some
 of
 the
 most
 interesting
 datas
 and


some
 of
 my interesting
 ideas
 come


through
 looking
 across
 borders
 across


the
 borders
 of
 industry.
 So
 how
 AI
 is


influencing
 medtech,
 how
 AI
 is


influencing
 material
 science
 innovation


in
 aerospace.
 I
 think
 those
 are
 more


interesting
 angles
 in
 or
 just
 as


interesting
 angles
 as
 purely
 looking
 at


AI
 as
 AI
 within
 technology
 itself.


>> What
 are
 the
 most
 what
 are
 some
 of
 the


most
 counterintuitive


benefits
 of
 AI
 that
 you
 are
 seeing
 in


your
 companies?
 I
 think
 the
 uh
 what
 is


happening
 within
 u
 medical
 technologies


is
 is
 not
 perhaps
 as
 well
 or
 broadly


understood
 as
 it
 should.
 So
 to
 give
 you


a
 very
 specific
 uh
 instance
 uh
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 imaging
 space
 so
 you
 know


MRIs,
 CT
 scans
 and
 so
 on
 the
 accuracy


and
 the
 speed
 at
 which
 these
 images
 can


be
 uh
 conducted
 are
 now
 improving
 at
 a


pace
 of
 almost
 70%.
 Uh
 versus
 what
 we


would
 have
 even
 a
 few
 years
 ago.
 that
 in


an
 aging
 demographic
 globally
 has
 been


incredibly
 helpful
 for
 not
 just


therapeutic
 care
 but
 preventive
 care
 and


in
 a
 way
 that
 makes
 obviously
 overall


care
 much
 more
 cost-effective.
 Um
 so
 I


think
 that
 is
 one
 big
 area
 around


imaging
 uh
 and
 really
 understanding


earlier
 how
 some
 of
 these
 chronic


diseases
 are
 are
 evolving
 and
 able
 and
 I


think
 obviously
 nipping
 these
 in
 the


butt
 earlier
 has
 been
 one
 big
 one.
 The


other
 big
 area
 uh
 has
 been
 uh
 around
 how


uh
 surgery
 is
 conducted.
 So
 I
 think
 the


intersection
 people
 talk
 about
 AI
 and


robotics
 in
 the
 manufacturing
 space.


What
 I
 think
 people
 don't
 realize


sometimes
 is
 there
 about
 300
 million


surgeries
 conducted
 globally.
 Uh
 and


they're
 just
 beginning
 to
 be
 penetrated


uh
 by
 you
 know
 what's
 happening
 with


robotic
 surgery
 specifically
 you
 know


companies
 like
 intuitive
 surgical.
 Um
 so


I
 think
 that
 is
 another
 big
 category
 uh


where
 you're
 beginning
 to
 see
 real


innovation
 happening
 where
 the


combination
 of
 um
 haptic
 feedback
 um


mapping
 software
 better
 technologies


around
 uh
 surgical
 conduct
 itself
 are


really
 leading
 to
 uh
 a
 lower
 error


easier
 training
 for
 medical
 students
 and


a
 overall
 better
 context
 uh
 for
 how


these
 uh
 therapeutic
 carees
 can
 be


conducted
 and
 as
 you
 know
 there's
 a
 big


discussion
 obviously
 around
 uh
 how


healthcare
 costs
 can
 be
 contained
 and
 I


have
 some
 hopes
 that
 AI
 applied


intelligently
 can
 can
 can
 help
 with


this.


>> Um,
 so
 yeah,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 broadly


this
 idea
 of
 how
 technology
 is


intersecting
 with
 non-technology


businesses
 and
 how
 you
 can
 use
 data
 to


analyze
 that
 and
 debias
 the
 very
 human


decision-m
 process
 something
 we
 spent
 a


lot
 of
 time
 on.


>> Very
 interesting.
 Now
 you
 believe
 in


concentration.
 You
 have
 quite
 big
 when


you
 when
 you
 go
 for
 something
 you
 go


pretty
 big,
 right?


>> Correct.


>> What
 um
 tell
 me
 how
 you
 think
 about


concentration.
 I
 very
 intentionally
 set


on
 these
 four
 verticals
 just
 happen
 to


be
 uh
 enterprise
 data
 so
 tech
 broadly
 um


financial
 services
 and
 healthcare


services
 as
 well
 as
 industrial


technologies
 because
 I
 felt
 those
 were


the
 areas
 where
 these
 themes
 of
 um


emerging
 technology
 disruption
 were
 most


relevant
 and
 where
 you
 could
 see
 market


leaders
 with
 very
 durable
 modes
 where


incremental
 returns
 and
 the
 capital
 you


could
 put
 to
 work
 at
 those
 incremental


returns
 had
 a
 clearer
 path
 given
 all
 the


technology
 trends
 we're
 seeing.
 today.


So
 we
 purely
 just
 focus
 on
 those
 four


areas.
 We
 also
 think
 about
 thematic


exposure
 as
 well.
 And
 the
 reason
 for


that
 I
 think
 is
 very
 simple.
 Um
 one
 I


think
 that
 allows
 you
 to
 play
 offense


when
 at
 some
 point
 or
 the
 other
 due
 to


you
 know
 the
 passive
 nature
 of
 the


market
 structure
 now
 increasingly
 the


odd
 factor
 rotation
 here
 or
 there
 could


disrupt
 uh
 a
 portfolio
 that
 allows
 us
 to


play
 offense
 during
 those
 periods.
 And


we
 believe
 there
 is
 actually


sufficiently
 interesting
 set
 of


investment
 ideas
 across
 each
 of
 these


four
 sectors
 where
 we're
 not


compromising
 uh
 and
 we
 have
 very


different
 drivers
 of
 the
 long
 thesis
 of


each
 of
 these
 names.


>> Now
 you
 uh
 grew
 up
 in
 India
 and
 I
 heard


you
 on
 a
 podcast
 once
 talking
 about


food.
 So
 how
 do
 you
 how
 how
 do
 you
 spice


up
 the
 portfolio?


>> I
 think
 the
 spice
 for
 us
 is
 quality.
 So


I
 think
 we
 have
 really
 moed
 long


duration
 businesses
 and
 we
 have
 very


debiased
 ways
 of
 tracking
 the
 data
 where


it's
 not
 just
 based
 on
 my
 intuition
 or


the
 team's
 intuition
 um
 but
 really
 based


on
 you
 know
 systemic
 thinking
 and
 not


siloed
 thinking.
 That's
 the
 spice
 that


seems
 really
 exciting
 to
 me
 because
 then


that's
 a
 really
 hard
 thing
 to
 think


about
 and
 do
 well.
 And
 I
 thinking
 I


think
 it's
 it's
 important
 for
 us
 to
 talk


about
 this
 a
 little bit
 and
 you're
 a


real
 student
 of
 the
 investment
 process


Nikolai
 but
 you
 know
 we're
 both
 we
 both


love
 the
 sort
 of
 Kaman
 Ferriski
 theor


work
 right
 and
 um
 I
 remember
 my
 father


once
 giving
 me
 this
 great
 quote
 from


Bertrren
 Russell
 which
 is
 humans
 will
 do


anything
 they
 can
 to
 not
 have
 to
 think


and
 it's
 very
 simple
 like
 Kaman
 talks


about
 system
 one
 and
 system
 two
 thinking


and
 system
 one
 thinking
 is
 that


intuitive


gut
 thinking
 that
 frankly
 is
 positive.


It
 drives
 very
 quick
 fluid
 reactions


from
 humanity
 dayto-day
 and
 it
 works


perfectly
 fine.
 But
 system
 two
 thinking


which
 is
 really
 getting
 into
 the
 weeds


and
 really
 thinking
 methodically
 and


logically
 is
 really
 hard.
 And
 so
 I
 try


to
 focus
 on
 making
 sure
 my
 team
 and
 our


portfolio
 is
 driven
 by
 system
 two


thinking.


>> Here
 I
 need
 to
 interject
 that
 I
 have


actually
 interviewed
 you
 once
 before
 for


my
 master's
 thesis
 in


>> Oh,
 that's
 right.


>> in
 in
 decision-m
 which
 was
 exactly
 about


that.
 you
 know
 when
 do
 you
 use
 uh
 you


know
 intuition
 and
 when
 do
 you
 when
 do


you
 use
 analysis?
 So
 how
 has
 your
 use
 of


pattern
 recognition
 changed
 during
 your


career?


>> My
 pattern
 recognition
 um
 has
 I
 think


expanded
 from
 being
 less
 driven
 by


individual


analyt
 analytical
 viewpoints
 and
 more
 to


thinking
 about
 the
 context.
 And
 so
 I've


probably
 over
 uh
 emphasized
 the
 person


and
 uh
 the
 CEO
 or
 the
 leadership
 or
 kind


of
 the
 hero
 model
 and
 underemphasized


the
 very
 powerful
 social
 context
 in


which
 companies
 businesses
 were


operating.
 Um
 and
 uh
 I
 learned
 this
 the


hard
 way.
 I've
 had
 plenty
 of
 failures,


but
 my
 first
 job,
 you
 know,
 working
 in


uh
 in
 in
 in
 Russia
 and
 Mongolia
 as
 a


junior
 analyst
 with
 the
 World
 Bank,
 um


you
 know,
 I
 I
 came
 in
 there,
 this
 is


this
 is
 particularly
 poignant
 example.
 I


came
 in
 there
 thinking,
 "Okay,
 great.


We're
 going
 to
 take
 these
 stateowned


enterprises.
 We're
 going
 to
 value
 them.


We're
 going
 to
 distribute
 tickets


through
 the
 various
 local
 bank
 branches,


open
 up
 the
 stock
 market.
 Boom.


Capitalism,
 liberal
 democracy,
 it's
 all


going
 to
 be
 awesome.
 The
 end
 of
 history


done."
 What
 happened
 was
 a
 little
 bit


different,
 right?
 We
 had
 instead
 a
 rise


of
 very
 corrupt
 practices.
 Um
 we
 had
 the


rise
 of
 autotocracy
 uh
 across
 across


these
 countries
 and
 we
 know
 the


headlines
 today
 still
 speak
 of
 these.


You
 cannot
 take
 away
 or
 abstract
 away


from
 70
 years
 of
 you
 know
 communist


history
 and
 simply
 assume
 that
 people


are
 going
 to
 just
 you
 know
 have
 a
 new


framework
 of
 thinking.
 So
 I
 think
 the


same
 is
 true
 today
 like
 you
 really
 have


to
 think
 about
 the
 very
 powerful
 overall


context
 as
 you're
 looking
 bottoms
 up
 at


businesses.
 you
 have
 to
 have
 almost
 the


right
 eye
 and
 the
 telescope
 and
 the
 left


eye
 and
 the
 microscope
 uh
 to
 really


think
 uh
 systemically
 and
 clearly
 about


um
 how
 these
 how
 how
 businesses
 will


evolve
 in
 the
 context
 in
 which
 they
 are


in
 today.
 So
 that's
 something
 I
 think


think
 a
 lot
 about
 is
 is
 is
 how
 do
 we


address
 these
 very
 specific
 failures
 of


our
 thinking.


>> You
 can
 also
 invest
 uh
 in
 uh
 private


companies.


>> Yes.


>> Why
 did
 you
 choose
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do


that?
 I
 think
 some
 of
 the
 we
 obviously


know
 uh
 about
 the
 very
 large
 market
 caps


that
 exist,
 very
 large
 businesses
 exist


in
 the
 private
 realm
 and
 we
 know
 about


the
 fact
 that
 there
 are
 fewer
 businesses


that
 are
 out
 there
 in
 the
 public
 markets


uh
 than
 have
 been
 for
 a
 while.
 Um
 so


those
 trends
 aside,
 I
 think
 another


reason
 to
 look
 at
 the
 private
 markets
 is


because
 they're
 often
 the
 most


disruptive.
 Change
 always
 happens
 at
 the


edges,
 not
 at
 the
 core,
 right?
 And


that's
 my
 fundamental
 view.
 And
 the
 edge


is
 is
 really
 the
 small
 company,
 the


private
 company,
 the
 unsung
 founder


who's
 just
 emerging.
 That's
 really
 where


change
 at
 the
 margin
 will
 happen.
 So


making
 sure
 that
 we
 have
 our
 networks


and
 thought
 processes
 out
 there,
 not


just
 in
 the
 US,
 but
 globally
 within


these
 four
 areas
 that
 we
 focus
 on,
 these


four
 big
 industry
 categories
 we
 focus
 on


is
 something
 that
 I
 think
 is
 incumbent


upon
 us
 and
 talking
 to
 private
 companies


as
 part
 of
 that
 process.
 It's
 as
 simple


as
 that.


>> How
 do
 you
 come
 up
 with
 ideas?
 So
 you


wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 then
 it's


like
 bang,
 I
 want
 to
 look
 at
 that.


>> It's
 not
 a
 wake
 up
 in
 the
 morning
 and


bang,
 I'll
 look
 at
 that.
 it's
 really
 a


longer
 duration.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 there's


there's
 a
 long
 incubation
 process,
 I


think,
 for
 me
 of
 ideas.
 So,
 I
 read
 a


lot.
 I
 think,
 you
 know,
 uh,
 I
 talk
 to
 my


team.
 I
 talk
 to,
 uh,
 the
 broader


networks
 that,
 uh,
 we
 all
 have
 access
 to


out
 there.
 But
 then,
 back
 to
 the
 point


about
 change
 happening
 at
 the
 edge.
 It's


really
 about
 going
 out
 in
 the
 field.


It's
 about
 going
 to
 that,
 you
 know,


obscure
 industry
 trade
 show
 that
 happens


to
 feature
 automation
 of,
 you
 know,
 new


robotic
 systems
 where
 you
 might
 get
 a


new
 idea.
 It
 might
 happen
 to
 be
 uh
 this


panel,
 this
 regular
 ongoing
 survey
 we've


done
 since
 before
 our
 launch
 of
 AI


developers
 in
 non-
 techch
 industries
 to


see
 what
 are
 they
 actually
 working
 on,


what
 are
 they
 actually
 trying
 out
 that's


working,
 that's
 not
 working.
 Um
 so
 it's


really
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 from
 more
 obscure


lenses
 that
 I
 get
 my
 best
 ideas
 versus


what
 you
 would
 expect,
 you
 know,
 just


just
 talking
 to
 uh
 the
 existing
 power


players,
 although
 that's
 obviously


important
 as
 well.


>> So
 then
 you
 have
 an
 idea.
 What
 do
 you
 do


with
 it?
 The
 next
 step
 is
 to
 to
 your


point
 uh
 your
 question
 earlier
 about


intuition
 system
 one
 versus
 system
 two


thinking
 is
 then
 to
 put
 it
 through
 a


very
 fine
 filter
 of
 the
 overall
 check


investment
 checklist.
 I
 very
 much


believe
 in
 a
 kind
 of a
 checklist
 driven


approach.
 um
 we
 go
 through
 that
 and
 then


in
 addition
 uh
 to
 my
 qu
 my
 my
 point


about
 biases
 making
 sure
 we
 have
 a
 way


to
 track
 the
 thesis
 uh
 and
 make
 sure


that
 we
 are
 we
 can
 hold
 on
 to
 that
 rope


and
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 is
 uh
 I
 think
 we


are
 very
 subject
 to
 some
 very
 colorfully


named
 biases
 right
 whether
 it's


confirmation
 bias
 or
 availability
 bias


or
 some
 cost
 bias
 I've
 you
 know
 when
 I


look
 across
 my
 many
 investment
 mistakes


uh
 they've
 all
 been
 you
 know
 one
 or
 the


other
 of
 these
 biases
 and
 they're
 very


human
 and
 they're
 natural
 and
 they
 have


some
 positive
 aspects
 But
 for
 investing


maybe
 a
 bit
 less
 so.
 So
 I'd
 like
 to
 make


sure
 that
 there's
 a
 data
 point
 that
 we


can
 attach
 our
 investment
 thesis
 to


that's
 unbiased
 so
 that
 the
 investment


team
 and
 I
 can
 track
 this
 and
 make
 sure


that
 we're
 you
 know
 we're
 we're
 we're


not
 uh
 just
 assuming
 uh
 issues
 that


might
 be
 headwinds
 to
 the
 thesis
 away.


>> Uh
 and
 uh
 I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 that.


I
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 also
 making
 sure


you
 know
 we're
 talking
 about
 errors
 of


omission
 and
 commission
 but
 I
 also
 want


to
 make
 sure
 we
 don't
 get
 into
 make


mistakes.
 So,
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 time
 is
 also


thinking
 about
 what
 are
 the
 assumptions


that
 are
 being
 made
 out
 there
 that
 could


possibly
 be
 wrong,
 where
 could
 things
 go


astray,
 where
 could
 market
 disruptions


happen.
 Uh,
 and
 so
 that's
 something
 I


spend
 just
 as
 much
 time
 on.
 And
 FOMO
 is


probably
 the
 biggest,
 right?
 So,
 I
 like


to
 tell
 my
 team
 it's
 not
 let's
 move
 from


FOMO
 to
 tomo,
 thoughtfully
 missing
 out,


making
 sure
 that
 we're
 looking
 at


whatever
 it
 happens
 to
 be,
 crypto
 or


quantum
 or
 whatever
 the
 flavor
 of
 the


day
 might
 be.
 Maybe
 we
 can
 try
 and


expand
 our
 circle
 of
 competence,
 but
 if


we
 can't,
 making
 it
 clear
 what
 our


circle
 of
 competence
 is.
 Keep
 pushing
 it


out,
 but
 be
 very
 clear
 about
 what
 those


lines
 are
 and
 not
 overstepping
 them.
 So,


I
 think
 I
 would
 say
 my
 ideas
 are
 as
 much


about
 uh
 steering
 the
 team
 as
 they
 are


about
 specific
 stocks.


>> How
 do
 you
 use
 them?
 How
 do
 you
 um
 do


they
 make
 decisions
 or
 they
 support
 you


in
 your
 decision-m?


>> I
 have
 a
 very
 experienced
 team.
 I'm
 very


lucky
 to
 work
 with
 this
 small
 handful
 of


of
 of
 truly
 excellent
 people
 who have


had,
 you
 know,
 decade
 or
 so
 each
 of
 of


long
 and
 short
 stock
 making
 experience.


Uh,
 and
 I
 really
 use
 them
 as


collaborators.
 I
 really
 think
 of
 them
 as


people
 that
 are
 very
 important
 to
 my


decision-making
 process.
 And
 uh,
 I
 could


not
 this
 is
 very
 much
 a
 team
 sport
 in
 my


view.
 And
 so
 you
 do
 need
 that
 strong


team.
 Uh,
 and
 I
 view
 myself
 as
 much
 a


coaching
 uh,
 and
 mentoring
 role.
 And
 one


of
 the
 big
 drivers
 of
 circle
 cap
 I
 hope


is
 that
 I
 can
 attract
 and
 mentor
 uh
 the


next
 generation
 of
 really
 great


investment
 talent.


>> So
 um
 thoughtfully
 missing
 out
 what
 are


the
 red
 flags
 that
 will
 keep
 you
 away


from
 something?


>> Uh
 one
 is
 compromise.
 So
 if
 you
 feel


that
 you
 are
 only
 buying
 a
 investing
 in


a
 business
 because
 of
 pure
 valuation
 or


you're
 investing
 in
 a
 business
 because


you
 think
 the
 founder
 is
 the
 next


messiah
 but
 there
 are
 other
 issues
 but


you're
 going
 to
 kind
 of
 smooth
 those


away.
 So,
 you
 know,
 basic
 essentially
 uh


being
 overly
 emotional
 uh
 in
 terms
 of


the
 investment
 decision-m
 whenever
 I
 see


that
 when
 I
 when
 I
 sometimes
 when
 I
 get


too
 excited
 about
 something
 even
 I
 think


that's
 a
 red
 flag
 to
 make
 sure
 that


we're
 really
 thinking
 in
 a
 very
 balanced


and
 thoughtful
 way
 about
 all
 the
 aspects


of
 a
 business
 uh
 as
 opposed
 to
 just


focusing
 on
 one
 and
 I
 think
 that's
 where


the
 bias
 is
 very
 inherent
 by
 you
 know
 as


humans
 we're
 very
 trained
 to
 look
 for


that
 one
 big
 exciting
 moment
 or
 thing
 uh


that's
 how
 we
 evolved
 right?
 We
 were


looking
 for
 the
 predator
 that
 was
 about


to
 pounce
 on
 us.
 Um,
 but
 in
 reality,
 I


think
 in
 the
 modern
 world,
 uh,
 it
 is
 not


that
 simple.
 In
 fact,
 it's
 incredibly


complex
 and
 there's
 a
 multiplicity
 of


factors
 that
 could
 go
 right
 and
 could
 go


wrong.
 And
 spending
 time
 in
 that
 full


gamut
 is
 something
 I
 make
 sure
 we
 do
 and


I
 make
 mistakes
 when
 I
 don't.
 It


>> It's
 not
 easy
 to
 leave
 emotions
 out
 of


it.
 I
 do
 think
 you
 need
 to
 have
 a


methodology
 and
 a
 process
 to
 bring
 that


into
 your
 system
 to
 thinking
 and
 and


creating
 tools
 so
 that
 you
 and
 your
 team


can
 nudge
 that
 way.
 Um
 and
 then
 remember


uh
 back
 to
 the
 nature
 of
 the
 markets


themselves,
 stocks
 move
 as
 much
 a


narrative
 as
 they
 move
 on
 numbers.
 So


you
 have
 to
 be
 respectful
 of
 that


context
 and
 just
 be
 appreciative
 of
 the


cont.
 back
 to
 my
 point
 about
 context
 uh


in
 even
 the
 the
 late
 dying
 days
 of
 the


Soviet
 Union
 and
 how
 powerful
 that
 was.


Um
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 something
 we
 need


to
 balance
 as
 well.


>> You
 mentioned
 uh
 MOAT
 uh
 long-term
 moat


um
 as
 a
 as
 a
 definition
 of
 quality.
 What


are
 the
 other
 type
 of
 quality
 signs


you're
 looking
 at?


>> Yeah.
 So
 uh
 when
 I
 say
 mode,
 what
 do
 I


mean
 by
 that?
 I
 mean
 a
 business
 that
 has


very
 high
 uh
 incremental
 ROIC's
 because


ultimately
 the
 value
 of
 a
 business
 is


going
 to
 be
 the
 return
 on
 incremental


invested
 capital
 times
 the
 do
 dollars


you
 can
 put
 to
 work
 at
 those
 incremental


returns
 right


>> so
 it's
 a
 balance
 of
 what
 is
 driving


that
 ROI
 I
 see
 and
 multiply
 you
 know


there
 multiple
 ways
 are
 really
 the
 best


ways
 right
 so
 if
 it's
 just
 by
 driving
 a


price
 I
 don't
 love
 that
 but
 if
 it's


driving
 a
 price
 and
 there's
 feature


innovation
 and
 there's
 market
 growth
 or


new
 geographies
 or
 new
 products
 that's


great
 so
 multip
 multiple
 believers
 on


driving
 ROIC
 is
 one.
 The
 second
 is
 the


capital
 you
 can
 put
 to
 work
 at
 those


incremental
 returns.
 There
 are
 many


businesses
 that
 have
 you
 know
 not
 many


but
 there's
 some
 great
 business
 have


high
 incremental
 returns
 but
 the
 capital


they
 can
 put
 to
 work
 at
 those


incremental
 returns
 are
 diminishing.
 the


growth
 market
 isn't
 there
 and
 so
 trying


to
 understand
 what
 category
 of
 business


that
 is
 and
 then
 even
 if
 they
 do
 have
 a


lot
 of
 capital
 they
 can
 put
 to
 work
 and


we're
 seeing
 this
 in
 the
 technology


space
 today


>> execution
 risk
 is
 enormous
 and
 so
 I


think
 we
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 we're


getting
 the
 level
 of
 return
 for
 that


level
 of
 capital
 being
 put
 to
 work


versus
 the
 the
 sales
 and
 size
 of
 the


existing
 business
 today
 because
 that


increases
 execution
 risk
 which
 is
 a
 risk


I
 very
 much
 need
 to
 think
 about.
 So
 I


think
 that
 combination
 of
 incremental


returns
 capital
 you
 can
 put
 to
 work
 in


those
 incremental
 returns
 having


multiple
 levers
 to
 both
 manage
 the


positives
 in
 one
 and
 the
 negatives
 of


execution
 risk
 in
 the
 other
 is
 what
 we


think
 about.


>> So
 um
 without
 uh
 talking
 about
 anything


you
 own
 in
 the
 portfolio
 just
 now
 but
 um


an
 example
 of
 a
 great
 investments
 that


you
 have
 had
 which
 would
 kind
 of
 tick


some
 of
 these
 boxes.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I
 would
 say
 the
 uh


broader
 you
 know
 and
 we've
 had
 some
 of


these
 investments
 in
 my
 prior
 role
 as


well.
 This
 is
 the
 great
 aspect
 of
 these


businesses.
 Um
 I
 think
 what's
 really


interesting
 right
 now
 is
 what's


happening
 with
 the
 chip
 stack.
 So
 we've


been
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 that.
 Um


so
 you
 have
 you
 know
 businesses
 like
 TSM


that
 are
 well
 known
 that
 have
 really


kind
 of


>> there's
 a
 Taiwan


>> corner
 in
 Taiwan
 kind
 of
 the
 process


engineering
 aspects
 of
 that.
 So
 it's
 not


really
 just
 about


>> one
 thing
 it's
 all
 about
 multiple


things.
 So
 I
 love
 that
 sort
 of
 systemic


modes
 where
 there
 isn't
 just
 one
 little


simple
 uh
 it's
 not
 you
 just
 own
 the
 gold


only
 gold
 mine
 in
 town.
 It's
 that
 you


own
 the
 process
 around
 uh
 how
 how
 how


the
 gold
 mine
 is
 is
 extracted.
 So
 I


think
 we
 I
 I I
 like
 businesses
 that
 have


those
 kinds
 of
 those
 dynamics
 to
 them.
 I


also
 think
 there's
 something
 really


interesting
 happening
 now
 in
 the
 in
 the


chip
 layer
 in
 AI
 where
 um
 there's
 been
 a


lot
 of
 talk
 about
 training
 but
 I
 think


you
 know
 training
 is
 a
 little
 spiky
 but


inference
 is
 the
 is
 the
 annuity
 stream


right
 ultimately
 this
 is
 what
 we're


going
 to
 be
 calling
 on
 the
 models
 to
 do


day
 in
 day
 out
 and
 those
 are
 going
 to
 be


within
 specific
 LLMs
 Google
 will
 have


its
 own
 inference
 stack
 um
 open
 AAI
 uh


anthropic
 and
 others
 and
 I
 think
 what
 is


happening
 around
 Google's
 TPU
 is
 really


interesting
 in
 terms
 of
 reducing
 that
 so


I
 I
 think
 um
 AS6
 or
 ASIC
 chips


application
 specific
 chips
 that
 are


designed
 for
 specific
 types
 of
 workloads


and
 what's
 happening
 around
 that
 creates


very
 long
 duration
 modes
 and
 so
 we've


been
 focusing
 a
 lot
 in
 that
 kind
 of


thematic.
 We
 talked
 about
 medical


technologies
 earlier
 but
 I
 do
 think
 the


combination
 of
 go
 to
 market
 modes


combined
 with
 you
 know
 process


innovation
 that
 just
 keeps
 compounding


embedded
 in
 a
 large
 pool
 of
 you
 know


global
 doctors
 nurse
 practitioners
 out


there
 actually
 executing
 creates
 a
 lot


of
 you
 know
 stickiness
 as
 well.
 So
 I


think
 that's
 another
 area
 of
 of
 sort
 of


where
 great
 businesses
 uh
 are
 are
 really


emerging
 and
 forming
 and
 have
 formed.
 Um


so
 those
 are
 probably
 two
 big
 buckets
 in


what's
 happening
 around
 the
 chip
 stack


layer
 which
 have
 really
 and
 and
 the


medtech
 which
 have
 played
 off
 the
 last


20
 years.
 So
 these
 are
 not
 new
 these
 are


I
 think
 um
 there's
 another
 interesting


category
 as
 well
 where
 there's
 a
 view


that
 AI
 is
 maybe
 disrupting
 a
 little
 bit


more
 than
 it
 actually
 is.
 And
 so
 I
 think


within
 sort
 of
 real-
 time
 data
 and
 data


analytics,
 there's
 some
 proprietary
 data


providers
 we
 we
 uh
 I
 think
 are
 really


interesting
 and
 are
 really
 terrific


businesses
 where
 they
 have
 both
 the


system
 of
 record
 and
 the
 system
 of


workflow
 from
 combined
 and
 that
 combined


with
 a
 very
 basic
 innovation
 engine.


Those
 three
 combined
 often
 create
 very


durable.


>> What
 type
 of
 companies
 would
 that
 be?


>> So
 those
 would
 be
 businesses
 um
 that


provide
 for
 example
 financial
 data.
 So


think
 about
 um
 even
 for
 um
 your


portfolio
 uh
 all
 of
 the
 real-time


pricing
 that's
 needed
 for
 FX
 clearance


or
 for
 fixed
 income
 or
 for
 the
 equity


markets.
 I
 think
 those
 are
 real-time


data
 very
 hard
 for
 a
 LLM
 for
 example
 to


ever
 disrupt
 because
 of
 the
 real-time


nature
 of
 that.
 But
 that's
 embedded
 in


real
 workflows
 around
 trading
 and


compliance
 that
 I
 think
 are
 very
 hard
 to


disrupt
 as
 well.
 Um
 so
 I
 think
 there's
 a


perception
 that
 those
 can
 be
 scraped


away
 uh
 by
 the
 AI
 uh
 models
 but
 I
 think


that's
 almost


very
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 see
 or
 understand.


>> What
 kind
 of
 time
 horizon
 do
 you
 have


when
 you
 invest
 or
 when
 you
 think
 about


investments


>> for
 as
 long
 as
 possible
 on
 the
 long
 side


obviously
 um
 shorts
 are
 obviously


different.
 They're
 more
 catalyst
 driven


and
 usually
 tend
 to
 have
 sort
 of
 you


know
 sub
 ninemonth
 kind
 of
 catalyst


periods
 but
 on
 the
 long
 side
 as
 I
 said


uh
 I
 trust
 our
 process
 to
 look
 at


duration.
 So
 we're
 really
 looking
 as
 I


said
 for
 that
 combination
 of
 factors


driving
 incremental
 returns
 and
 capital


that
 can
 be
 put
 to
 work
 at
 those


incremental
 returns
 that
 really
 are


playing
 out
 certainly
 over
 3
 to
 5
 year


cycle
 in
 terms
 of
 our
 valuation
 horizon


but
 ideally
 we
 see
 levers
 beyond
 that.


>> How
 uh
 does
 shorting
 compare
 with
 long


investing?
 Can
 the
 same
 person
 do
 both?


It's
 a
 it's
 a
 great
 question
 because


it's
 really
 the
 opposite
 muscle
 of
 the


long
 side
 as
 you
 know
 it's
 really


thinking
 about
 uh
 so
 sometimes
 you
 will


see
 clear
 the
 shorts
 that
 are
 the
 broken


mirror
 images
 of
 the
 longs
 x
 is
 winning


y
 is
 losing
 um
 I
 find
 those
 are
 very


rare
 uh
 and
 few
 and
 far
 between
 and


that's
 not
 enough
 usually
 I
 think
 in


addition
 to
 that
 you
 have
 to
 have
 the


timing
 correct
 as
 to
 when
 exactly
 those


uh
 winner
 loser
 dynamics
 will
 play
 out


usually
 uh
 if
 it
 plays
 out
 through
 um


some
 combination
 of
 uh
 clear
 price


competitive
 pressures,
 clear
 share


competitive
 pressures
 leading
 to
 those


pricing
 pressures
 um
 and
 then
 that


combined
 with
 you
 know
 other
 factors


such
 as
 just
 misexecution
 by
 management


uh
 you
 have
 a
 pretty
 good
 pretty
 good


short.
 The
 problem
 though
 is
 that


combination
 of
 factors
 occurring
 within


the
 time
 frame
 you
 need
 uh
 is
 a
 tricky


one.
 Uh
 and
 then
 add
 to
 that
 all
 of
 the


sort
 of
 um
 factor
 rotations
 and
 the


passive
 uh
 nature
 of
 the
 markets
 today


often
 driven
 by
 quant
 and
 ETF
 and
 other


funds.
 You
 have
 other
 dynamics
 that
 are


driving
 trading
 you
 need
 to
 think
 about.


>> Do
 you
 short?


>> We
 do
 short.


>> It's
 just
 so
 so
 stressful.


>> I
 mean
 it's
 because
 you
 are
 you
 are


wrong
 for
 such
 a
 long
 period
 of
 time
 and


when
 you're
 right
 it's
 just
 like
 in


these
 bursts,
 you
 know,
 and
 they
 don't


last
 very
 long.
 You
 may
 be
 like
 super


right
 for
 one
 week
 and
 then
 you're
 kind


of
 wrong
 again
 for
 two
 years,
 right?


It's
 hard
 taking
 day
 in
 day
 out.


>> We
 still
 look
 for
 absolute
 profit,


dollar
 shorts.


>> Do
 you
 care
 about
 valuations?


>> I
 do.
 I
 think
 valuation
 matters
 a
 lot.


Uh
 we
 look
 at
 free
 cash
 flow
 multiples.


Uh
 we
 expend
 stockbased
 comp.
 We
 do
 all


the
 unfashionable
 things
 and
 look
 at


things
 pretty
 conservatively.
 Uh
 and
 the


reason
 for
 that
 is
 what
 I
 said
 earlier


about
 wanting
 to
 manage
 risk.
 So


thinking
 I
 think
 about
 riskadjusted


returns
 and
 I
 think
 valuation
 and
 what


you
 pay
 upfront
 is
 very
 much
 a
 part
 of


that
 and
 particularly
 uh
 thinking
 about


valuation
 and
 the
 information


asymmetries
 in
 the
 market
 even
 more
 so.


>> Let's
 go
 back
 to
 your
 time
 at
 uh
 Lumpine


uh
 and
 you
 you
 know
 you
 set
 it
 up
 with


Steve
 Mandal.
 Um
 what
 did
 you
 what
 was


the
 most
 important
 learnings
 from
 your


time
 at
 Lomine?


>> Yeah.
 Um
 I
 think
 uh
 there
 were
 several
 I


mean
 I
 think
 uh
 and
 I
 was
 really
 lucky


to
 work
 with
 the
 the
 brilliant
 group
 of


people
 there
 including
 Steve.
 Um
 I
 would


say
 one
 of
 the
 big
 lessons
 I
 distilled


was
 really
 what
 we
 discussed
 around


biases.
 Let
 me
 give
 you
 a
 very
 specific


example.
 I'll
 give
 you
 a
 couple
 of


examples.
 Um
 and
 you
 talked
 about


shorts.
 We
 can
 start
 with
 shorts.
 One
 of


one
 of
 my
 biggest
 mistakes
 at
 Lomine
 was


shorting
 Nokia


and
 I
 shorted
 Nokia
 for


>> went
 down
 at
 the
 end.


>> So
 this
 is
 what's
 interesting.
 So,
 you


know,
 thought
 I
 was
 absolutely
 right.


And
 then
 obviously
 2014,
 Microsoft
 comes


out
 and
 buys
 the
 thing
 for
 $7
 billion.


And
 it
 was
 a
 very
 painful
 day
 for
 me
 and


for
 and
 for
 my
 firm.
 Um,
 and
 then
 18


months
 later,
 Microsoft
 writes
 it
 off.


It's
 gone.
 And
 so,
 you
 can
 be
 right
 and


you
 can
 be
 completely
 and
 utterly
 wrong


to
 your
 earlier
 point
 of
 the
 short
 side.


So,
 what
 was
 the
 lesson?
 The
 lesson
 is


um
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 business
 as
 a


standalone
 business,
 yes,
 you
 were


right.
 Great.
 However,
 you
 didn't
 really


think
 about
 all
 of
 the
 other,
 you
 know,


strategic
 value
 of
 the
 business
 broadly


over
 time.
 So,
 thinking
 about
 a
 business


not
 in
 isolation,
 but
 thinking
 more


systemically,
 but
 not
 in
 silos
 is


something
 I
 have
 to
 learn
 over
 and
 over


again
 and
 something
 I
 teach
 my
 team.
 So,


systemic
 not
 silo
 thinking,
 that's


number
 one.
 And
 the
 Noki
 example
 is
 one.


The
 other
 is
 avoiding
 um
 balance
 sheet


leverage
 like
 uh
 public
 LBOS's
 I've


learned
 the
 hard
 way
 are
 probably
 not
 my


thing.
 I've
 made
 mistakes
 where
 I
 have


invested
 in
 decent
 businesses
 that
 were


over
 pretty
 decent
 business
 that
 were


overlevered.
 Uh
 but
 as
 a
 result
 they
 had


much
 less
 maneuvering
 cap
 capacity
 when


times
 of
 inevitable
 macro
 tensions


arose.
 So
 that's
 another
 big
 big
 lesson


and
 I
 made
 mistakes
 there.
 um
 businesses


like
 Altis
 for
 example.
 Um
 the
 third
 is


I
 think
 maybe
 the
 most
 interesting
 one


going
 back
 to
 discussions
 of
 the
 AI
 chip


stack
 uh
 and
 of
 how
 old
 technologies
 can


disrupt
 in
 new
 ways
 which
 is
 uh
 Nvidia.


So
 Nvidia
 um
 saw
 it
 very
 much
 as
 a
 GPU


business
 what
 it
 was.
 But
 then
 2015
 we


had
 the
 uh
 deep
 reinforcement
 learn
 the


deep
 mind
 papers
 come
 out
 and
 it
 was


incredibly
 interesting
 and
 exciting
 and


you
 began
 to
 see
 how
 parallel
 compute


would
 be
 necessary
 how
 GPUs
 would
 be


helpful
 for
 that
 par
 essential
 for
 that


parallel
 compute
 to
 work
 to
 drive
 this


interesting
 new
 engine
 of
 machine


learning.
 didn't
 know
 what
 generative
 AI


was
 going
 to
 happen,
 but
 you
 definitely


saw
 what
 was
 happening
 with
 machine


learning
 and
 early
 stages
 of
 what
 would


then
 become,
 you
 know,
 gener
 generative


AI.
 Um,
 and
 the
 fact
 that
 was
 back
 then


apart
 from
 just
 uh
 GPUs
 for
 video
 games,


there
 was
 a
 big
 crypto
 component
 as


well.
 So,
 it
 was
 gaming
 and
 crypto
 that


was
 driving
 Nvidia
 at
 the
 time.
 And
 I


said,
 well,
 yeah,
 but
 there
 was
 going
 to


be
 this
 AI
 thing
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 be


big.
 uh
 turns
 out
 they
 missed
 ma
 you


know
 significantly
 because
 of
 a
 you
 know


concentrate
 crash
 in
 crypto
 and
 and
 uh


game
 uh
 permitting
 delays
 in
 China
 which


were
 driving
 a
 big
 portion
 of
 demand
 for


the
 video
 gaming
 part
 of
 the
 business.


Um
 so
 I
 sold
 which
 I
 shouldn't
 have
 but


here's
 the
 bigger
 that
 was
 a
 mistake
 but


the
 bigger
 mistake
 was
 not
 that
 the


bigger
 mistake
 was
 then
 not
 revisiting


Nvidia
 later.
 So
 this
 some
 cost
 bias
 I


find
 is
 a
 very
 powerful
 one
 and
 that's


why
 I
 spend
 so
 much
 time
 now
 at
 SIGRO
 to


make
 sure
 that
 we
 keep
 a
 strong
 kind
 of


survey
 of
 the
 available
 idea
 sets
 out


there
 and
 make
 sure
 we
 continually


revise
 including
 the
 names
 that
 we


missed.
 So
 areas
 of
 emission
 as
 well
 to


make
 sure
 we
 don't
 bump
 into
 this
 issue


repeatedly.


>> It's
 so
 difficult
 to
 buy
 back
 things
 you


sold
 lower
 on.
 Yeah,
 but
 that's
 in
 my


opinion
 that's
 not
 an
 excuse.
 And
 I


think
 I
 think
 precisely
 because
 that
 is


so
 hard
 it's
 a
 really
 important
 and


interesting
 opportunity
 set
 for
 new


ideas


>> uh
 when
 when
 you
 are
 wrong
 which
 happens


a
 lot.
 Um
 and
 so
 at least
 to
 me
 so
 I


think
 that's
 some
 those
 are
 those
 are


probably
 three
 concrete
 examples
 of


clear
 lessons.
 one
 around
 systemic
 not


siloed
 thinking,
 the
 other
 around


weariness
 around
 financial
 leverage


versus
 the
 other
 drivers
 of
 leverage


that
 we
 all
 are
 happy
 about
 and
 the


third
 being
 around
 these
 biases
 uh
 that


we
 talked
 about
 earlier
 including
 the


sun
 cause
 bias.


>> Uh
 well,
 I'd
 love
 to
 ask
 you
 um
 a
 couple


of
 questions
 just
 on
 um
 slightly
 more


personal
 nature.
 Do
 you
 think
 uh
 I
 mean


you
 grew
 up
 partly
 in
 the
 US,
 partly
 in


India.
 Um
 do
 you
 think
 that
 m


multicultural
 background
 is
 impacting


the
 way
 you
 view
 the
 world
 and


investments?


>> Very
 much
 so.
 Uh
 I
 would
 say
 uh
 growing


up
 in
 India,
 growing
 up
 in
 a
 Bangalore


that
 was
 not
 the
 Bangalore
 it
 is
 today.


A
 very
 sleepy
 town.
 It
 was
 actually


considered
 a
 retirement
 town
 at
 that


point.
 My
 parents
 are
 both
 um
 my


mother's
 a
 doctor,
 my
 father's
 an


academic.
 Uh
 and
 they
 you
 know
 worked
 uh


there
 in
 in
 the
 in
 that
 capacity.
 uh
 and


it
 was
 a
 very
 quiet,
 very
 academic
 uh


very
 cerebral
 up
 upbringing
 in
 many


ways.
 But
 it
 was
 not
 without
 exposure
 to


the
 very
 uh
 stark
 realities
 of
 India
 at


the
 time.
 Uh
 an
 India
 that
 was
 uh


suffering
 in
 many
 ways
 from
 the
 u
 from


the
 walls
 that
 were
 put
 up.
 It
 was
 it


was
 a
 closed
 off
 economy
 at
 the
 time,


the
 license
 raj
 as
 it
 was
 called.
 Uh
 and


it
 was
 very
 apparent
 that
 that
 was


leading
 to
 real
 you
 know
 issues
 for
 the


for
 the
 economy
 overall
 even
 as
 a
 young


girl
 growing
 up.
 But
 I
 think
 also
 seeing


the
 level
 of
 income
 inequality
 something


that
 is
 striking
 not
 just
 India
 but
 the


world
 at
 large
 and
 the
 perils
 of
 that


became
 very
 clear
 to
 me
 and
 the


resulting
 loss
 in
 trust
 in
 institutions


the
 resulting
 corruption
 that
 that
 often


results
 in
 uh
 was
 something
 I
 grew
 up


with
 and
 was
 I
 just
 was
 all
 around
 me


and
 I
 think
 it's
 something
 that
 led
 in


me
 at
 least
 to
 a
 very
 fierce
 sense
 of
 a


need
 to
 give
 back
 and
 be
 of
 service.
 uh


and
 I
 think
 that's
 partly
 also
 my
 my


family.
 Um
 my
 great-grandmother
 was
 in


jail
 working
 because
 of
 her
 work
 uh
 with


the
 independence
 movement
 under
 Gandhi.


Uh
 and
 I
 think
 that
 idea
 of
 social


service
 and
 how
 you
 give
 back
 was
 very


much
 that
 became
 all
 the
 more
 reinforced


by
 the
 social
 realities
 of
 growing
 up
 in


India.
 Now
 all
 of
 that
 said
 it
 was
 also


wonderful
 in
 some
 ways
 partly
 also


because
 of
 the
 barrier.
 a
 very
 strong


local
 culture
 and
 local
 dynamic
 and
 a


very
 rich
 um
 literature
 and
 uh
 sense
 of


history
 and
 self
 that
 came
 about
 uh
 as


well
 from
 some
 of
 the
 the
 fact
 that
 you


know
 India
 was
 more
 more
 closed
 off
 at


that
 point
 in
 time
 and
 so
 I
 think
 as
 a


result
 of
 all
 of
 that
 I
 also
 came
 away


with
 this
 sense
 of
 great
 pride
 in
 in
 in


what
 India
 stands
 for
 and
 what
 it
 has


become
 today
 and
 what
 will
 become
 in
 the


future.
 you
 are
 a
 role
 model
 for
 many


women
 and
 um
 and
 I
 think
 when
 you
 when


you
 launched
 your
 fund
 it
 was
 the


biggest
 launch
 biggest
 hedge
 fund
 launch


of
 any
 woman
 ever
 right
 that's
 is
 pretty


pretty
 amazing
 any
 reflections
 around


being
 a
 woman
 in
 the
 investment
 world


>> I
 would
 say
 look
 I
 first
 of
 all
 I
 hope


that's
 a
 record
 that's
 broken
 very


quickly
 uh
 and
 I
 and
 I'm
 sure
 it
 will
 be


uh
 there's
 some
 really
 amazing
 talented


women
 out
 there
 um
 look
 I
 hope
 I'm
 not


just
 a
 role
 model
 for
 women
 but
 you
 know


the
 broader
 investment
 community
 and


hopefully
 over
 time
 the
 philanthropic


community
 as
 well.
 That's
 a
 very


important
 part
 of
 my
 my
 my
 work
 and
 my


ethos
 and
 my
 identity.
 Um
 I
 would
 say
 um


I'm
 a
 little
 I
 really
 think
 the


investment
 business
 broadly
 uh
 whether


you're
 uh
 whether
 whether
 you're
 an


outsider
 in
 any
 way,
 shape,
 or
 form
 um


is
 a
 great
 one.
 It's
 about
 as


meritocratic
 a
 business
 as
 I
 can
 think


of.
 I
 mean,
 I
 could
 be
 a
 green
 Martian


with
 two
 horns
 in
 my
 head,
 but
 if
 I


produce
 investment
 returns,
 there'll
 be


a
 line
 out
 the
 door
 uh
 you
 know,
 wanting


to
 get
 my
 my
 product,
 right?
 So
 I
 think


it's
 a
 very
 meritocratic
 industry
 and
 I


just
 hope
 that
 places
 like
 Serggo,


places
 like
 uh
 you
 know
 the
 platform


you're
 running
 here
 are
 just
 ways
 for


more
 people
 to
 add
 value
 in
 this


industry
 because
 I
 really
 think
 it's
 a


it's
 a
 terrific
 one
 for
 people
 who
 are


intellectually
 curious
 of
 all
 stripes


and
 shapes
 and
 sizes
 to
 come
 in
 and
 and


and
 be
 of
 be
 of
 use
 to
 the
 world
 at


large.


>> Well,
 you
 have
 indeed
 many
 stripes


because
 you
 are
 interested
 in
 so
 many


different
 things.
 you
 I
 mean
 you've


written
 you've
 written
 a
 book,
 you've


been
 involved
 with
 a
 play.
 Um


how
 does
 uh
 all
 this
 um
 play
 into
 your


kind
 of
 creativity
 and
 curiosity?


>> I
 think
 uh


>> but
 tell
 me
 about
 some
 of
 the
 stuff
 you


do
 first
 because
 you
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 funky


stuff.


>> Uh
 I
 do
 two
 main
 things
 apart
 from
 my


professional
 works.
 One
 is
 the


philanthropy
 uh
 which
 we
 can
 talk
 about


and
 you
 asked
 about
 the
 creative
 works.


I
 can
 talk
 about
 that
 first.
 Um
 the
 the


well
 let's
 talk
 about
 the
 philanthropy.


So
 on
 the
 philan
 phil philanthropic


front
 um
 I
 started
 very
 early.
 So
 from


year
 one
 at
 Lomi
 I
 felt
 it
 was
 very


important
 to
 start
 giving
 back.
 Uh
 and


just
 as
 I
 do
 as
 investor
 it
 was
 really


about
 backing
 really
 great
 social


entrepreneurs
 and
 making
 sure
 we
 could


see
 them
 and
 see
 them
 early.
 Um
 so
 I
 was


very
 lucky
 to
 meet
 uh
 Paul
 Farmer
 who


was
 early
 in
 building
 partners
 in
 health


at
 the
 time.
 Um
 uh
 he
 sadly
 passed
 away


uh but
 was
 a
 great
 mentor
 to
 me.
 uh
 and


uh
 he
 said
 he
 always
 said
 you
 know


public
 health
 is
 more
 like
 you
 know


armed
 robbery
 than
 it
 is
 you
 know


helping
 the
 old
 lady
 cross
 the
 road.
 You


have
 to
 break
 things
 to
 build
 things.


And
 it
 it
 truly
 is
 and
 and
 there's
 a
 lot


that
 needs
 to
 be
 done
 in
 terms
 of


breaking
 siloed
 thinking
 to
 really
 get


solutions
 to
 people
 uh
 in
 a
 rural


maternity
 clinic
 in
 India
 for
 example
 um


that
 I
 learned
 through
 people
 like
 him


through
 people
 like
 Otul
 Gowande
 uh
 and


others
 that
 I've
 worked
 with
 and
 that


all
 led
 to
 uh
 uh
 Sema
 Guyire
 who
 was
 uh


working
 at
 Gates
 Foundation
 at
 the
 time


and
 I
 to
 set
 up
 Sergo
 Health
 uh
 and
 this


this
 really
 going
 back
 now
 over
 a
 decade


and
 our
 view
 was
 very
 much
 how
 do
 we


take
 healthcare
 service
 delivery


and
 really
 help
 with
 data
 sets
 that
 are


targeted
 not
 just
 data
 and
 the
 set
 of


data
 but
 behavioral
 data.
 So
 I
 think
 one


of the
 most
 interesting
 things
 happening


potentially
 in
 AI
 is
 adding
 the
 why
 to


AI.
 Not
 I
 AI
 is
 very
 good
 at
 solving


what
 questions.
 What
 ad
 will
 Nikolai


click
 on
 next
 but
 not
 why.
 And
 I
 think


adding
 um
 this
 large
 scale
 behavioral


data
 uh
 which
 you
 can
 do
 with
 you
 know


sort
 of
 some
 pretty
 basic
 basian
 uh


networking
 math
 to
 say
 this
 is
 why
 a


woman
 is
 not
 going
 to
 the
 maternity


clinic
 to
 to
 deliver.
 this
 is
 why
 uh
 XYZ


is
 not
 using
 contraception
 in
 this


community
 is
 something
 that
 we've
 been


spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 and
 and
 data


as
 a
 public
 good
 and
 data
 science
 as
 a


public
 good
 is
 something
 we
 we we
 spend


a
 lot
 of
 time
 on.
 So
 that's
 that's
 a
 big


part
 of
 the
 philanthropic
 effort
 and
 we


work
 with
 groups
 like
 the
 Beninda
 Gates


Foundation
 and
 others
 as
 well
 as
 local


governments
 to
 help.
 So
 for example
 and


one
 thing
 that's
 was
 interesting
 is
 the


maternal
 mortality
 work
 where
 we
 did
 a


lot
 of
 this
 work
 in
 India
 to
 help
 target


the
 state
 of
 Uttar
 Pradesh
 spending
 a


billion
 bucks
 a
 year
 on
 just
 maternity


clinic
 adoption
 and
 driving
 that
 up
 and


then
 we're
 getting
 calls
 from
 people
 in


the
 US
 saying
 maternal
 mortality
 is


rising
 here
 it's
 a
 real
 problem
 how
 can


we
 use
 those
 same
 techniques
 here
 in
 the


US
 and
 then
 that
 then
 led
 to
 a
 really


program
 with
 Uber
 you
 know
 with
 DAR


actually
 I
 reached
 out
 to
 I
 think
 you've


interviewed
 here
 um
 to
 do
 rides
 for
 moms


so
 the
 problem
 was
 not
 you
 The
 problem


was
 having
 a
 maternity
 plan
 and
 making


sure
 women
 actually
 went
 to
 the
 clinic


in
 which
 case
 transportation
 was


actually
 an
 interesting
 thing.
 It
 was


transport
 not
 hospital
 care.
 So


understanding
 the
 why
 is
 really


important.
 So
 that
 I'll
 wrap
 up
 there


but
 I
 think
 that's
 a
 really
 important


side
 where
 both
 the
 technology
 side
 and


the
 philanthropic
 side
 overlap
 really


interestingly
 on
 the
 creative
 work.
 Um


look
 I
 think
 we're
 happiest
 as
 people


when
 not
 when
 we're
 you
 know
 obsessing


over
 ourselves
 but
 when
 we
 forget


ourselves
 whether
 it's
 our
 professional


work
 or
 philanthropic
 work
 or
 creative


work.
 And
 so
 I
 very
 much
 do
 it
 out
 of


joy
 have
 since
 college.
 um
 writing
 short


stories
 that
 is
 and
 um
 I
 think
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day
 everything
 is
 a
 narrative


right
 and
 we
 had
 dinner
 recently
 with
 a


group
 of
 very
 diverse
 range
 of
 very


successful
 people
 and


>> well
 you
 you
 predictions


>> you
 do
 you
 do
 fun
 dinners


>> and
 we
 asked
 them
 to
 do
 predictions
 they


all
 came
 up
 with
 pretty
 pessimistic
 ones


so
 there's
 this
 conflict
 between
 the


narrative
 self
 and
 what
 I
 see
 how
 I
 see


myself
 uh
 versus
 the
 social
 self
 social


context
 and
 so
 I
 think
 that
 conflict
 is


something
 I
 I
 like
 to
 to
 write
 about
 and


think
 about
 and
 It's
 it's
 been
 really


fun.


>> What
 about
 the
 theater
 project?


>> Yeah,
 so
 the
 theater
 project,
 the


theater
 of
 the
 mind,
 uh
 it's
 a
 uh
 it
 was


based
 actually
 in
 a
 series
 of
 uh


neuroscience
 experiments.
 I
 uh
 had
 was


very
 interested
 in
 what
 was
 happening


around
 some
 of
 these
 economic
 games.
 We


talked
 about
 Kaman
 Thaylor
 and


Ferriski's
 work.
 Uh
 there's
 one
 called


the
 dictators
 game
 for example
 where


even
 though
 uh
 an
 individual
 in
 a
 group


playing
 this
 game
 could
 take
 all
 of
 the


coins
 on
 the
 table,
 they
 do
 not.
 They


want
 to
 share.
 So
 that's
 hopeful.
 Uh,


and
 I
 was
 interested
 in
 that
 and
 I


wanted
 to
 take
 that
 to
 the
 basement
 of


the
 science
 museum
 in
 London,
 one
 of
 the


great
 museums
 of
 the
 world.
 And
 my


friend
 Brian
 Eno
 said,
 "No,
 no,
 no.


There's
 something
 more
 to
 this


introduced
 me
 to
 to
 David
 Burn
 who
 was


thinking
 about
 an
 experiment
 in
 a
 very


different
 context.
 Uh,
 which
 was
 more


sensory
 playing
 with
 propriception
 and


how
 you
 can
 inhabit
 the
 body
 of
 a
 doll


is
 actually
 a
 Swedish
 lab
 called
 Erson


Labs
 that
 did
 this
 work.
 Uh,
 and
 when
 we


met,
 we
 thought,
 okay,
 this
 is
 actually


something
 else
 completely
 different,


which
 is
 a
 theater
 piece.
 It
 has
 a


narrative.
 It's
 a
 story
 of
 a
 life
 of
 a


man
 living
 his
 life
 backwards,
 dealing


with
 memories
 with
 these
 experimental


aspects
 woven
 in.
 Uh
 it
 played
 very


successfully
 in
 Denver
 and
 it's
 now


moving
 to
 the
 Goodman
 Theater
 in


Chicago.
 So
 that's
 been
 really
 fun
 as


well.
 So
 it
 just
 it's
 it's
 you
 know
 it's


really
 about
 thinking
 in
 new
 and
 fresh


ways
 and
 making
 sure
 that
 that
 feeds


into
 a
 more
 creative
 uh
 less
 less
 siloed


thinking.


>> How
 do
 you
 bring
 all
 this
 back
 into


investing?
 I
 think
 all
 of
 this
 goes
 back


to
 this
 idea
 of
 how
 everything
 is
 a


narrative
 in
 some
 ways
 and
 really


thinking
 about
 um
 the
 context
 and
 how


powerful
 that
 is
 versus
 the
 individual


characters
 of
 the
 play
 and
 how
 they
 all


work
 together
 to
 really
 thinking
 about
 a


systemic
 whole.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 the


common
 point
 across
 each
 of
 these.
 Uh


the
 other
 is
 curiosity.
 I
 think


curiosity
 is
 key
 to
 pretty
 much


everything
 we
 do
 in
 each
 of
 these,


whether
 it's
 solving
 a
 problem


philanthropically,
 finding
 a
 great


investment
 and
 understanding
 it
 as
 well


as
 you
 can.
 Um,
 or
 producing
 a
 good
 a


good
 piece
 of
 creative
 work.
 I
 think
 the


other
 is
 openness.
 Um,
 so
 I
 think
 with


the
 writing
 it's
 a
 great
 exercise
 in


humility.
 Unlike
 the
 other
 two
 spheres


of
 my
 work,
 no
 one
 really
 cares
 if
 I


write
 another
 short
 story
 or
 not.
 The


world
 is
 plenty
 of
 those.
 But
 to
 really


make
 sure
 that
 that
 people
 do
 care,
 you


have
 to
 keep
 revising
 and
 revising
 and


what
 is
 revision
 to
 make
 it
 as
 good
 as


possible.
 And
 what
 is
 revision
 is
 just


openness
 to
 possibility
 and
 openness
 to


something
 better.
 And
 I
 think
 be
 aware


of
 certainty.
 I
 think
 that's
 probably


another
 commonality
 across
 all
 of
 these.


Uh
 the
 the
 the
 the
 person
 who's
 100%


sure
 that
 X
 or
 Y
 is
 happening
 is


something
 that
 always
 raises
 a
 red
 flag


with
 me.
 It
 never
 is
 that
 certain.


>> What's
 the
 key
 to
 staying
 curious
 and


humble?


Uh
 I
 think
 it
 is
 very
 it's
 a
 virtuous


circle
 right
 because
 if
 you're
 curious


and
 humble
 to
 begin
 with
 uh
 you
 learn


and
 you
 see
 how
 much
 more
 there
 is
 to


learn
 and
 that
 keeps
 you
 humble
 and
 then


you
 but
 you
 also
 are
 excited
 by
 the


possibilities
 out
 there.
 So
 I
 think
 it's


just
 very
 much
 a
 virtuous
 circle
 of
 uh


getting
 on
 that
 wheel
 to
 begin
 with
 and


I
 think
 plus
 more
 fun
 right
 what's
 more


fun
 than
 than
 learning.


>> When
 do
 you
 wake
 up?


>> Uh
 I
 wake
 up
 about
 6:00
 in
 the
 morning


every
 day.


>> What
 do
 you
 read?
 I
 typically
 read
 the


papers.
 I
 usually
 just
 spend
 time


thinking
 and
 then
 I,
 you
 know,
 I
 like


sometimes
 go
 for
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 walk
 and


then
 I
 then
 I
 read
 all
 the
 papers,
 the


usual
 stuff
 and
 then
 dive
 right
 into
 it.


>> How
 do
 you
 think?
 Do
 you
 just
 sit
 in
 a


chair
 and
 think?


>> You
 just
 walk,
 go
 for
 a
 walk,
 you
 know,


pace
 around.


>> Do
 you
 structure
 your
 thinking
 or
 are


you
 just
 like
 looking
 at
 dogs
 and
 trees


and


>> I
 don't
 believe
 in
 I
 have
 plenty
 of


structured
 thinking
 in
 the
 rest
 of
 my


day.
 So
 that
 point
 of
 the
 day
 I
 just
 let


my
 mind
 roam
 and
 uh
 see
 see
 what
 comes


up.
 How
 do
 you
 relax?


>> I
 relax
 with
 spending
 time
 with
 the


people
 I
 love,
 my
 friends,
 my
 family,
 uh


reading,
 you
 know,
 going
 for
 long
 hikes,


you
 know,
 so
 the
 so
 the
 the
 usual
 ways


of
 I
 think
 many
 of
 us
 have
 of


disconnecting,
 being
 with
 nature
 and


being
 being
 with
 friends
 and
 family.


>> Fantastic.
 Well,
 it's
 been
 great
 talking


to
 you.
 You
 are
 talking
 to
 curious,


humble,
 and
 an
 incredible
 professional.


It's
 great.


>> Thank
 you,
 Nichollet.


>> Thank
 you.
