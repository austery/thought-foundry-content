From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 [music]
 I'm


Natalie
 Kitro.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.


[music]


In
 the
 days
 since
 deposing
 Nicholas


Maduro,
 President
 Trump
 has
 given


several
 justifications
 [music]


for
 his
 dramatic
 action
 in
 Venezuela.


>> Number
 one,
 the
 drugs
 are
 pouring
 into


the
 country.
 You
 know
 that.
 Number


[music]
 two,
 the
 people
 are
 pouring
 into


the
 country.
 were.


>> But
 the
 thing
 Trump
 is
 most
 focused


[music]
 on,
 the
 thing
 he
 keeps
 pointing


to
 as
 central
 to
 his
 ambitions,


>> we're
 going
 to
 take
 back
 the
 oil
 that


frankly
 we
 should
 have
 taken
 back
 a
 long


time
 ago,


>> is
 oil.
 [music]


>> We're
 taking
 back
 what
 was
 taken
 from


us.
 They
 took
 our
 oil
 industry.
 We
 built


that
 entire
 oil
 industry.


>> Specifically,
 opening
 Venezuela's
 vast


oil
 fields
 to
 American
 companies.


>> They
 stole
 our
 assets
 like
 we
 were


babies.
 and
 the
 United
 States
 did


absolutely
 nothing
 about
 it.
 [music]
 So


now
 we're
 doing
 everything
 about
 it.


>> Today,
 my
 colleague
 Anatoli
 Kermanav


[music]


explains
 the
 history
 behind
 Trump's


claim
 that
 this
 is
 our
 oil
 and
 what
 it


would
 really
 take
 [music]
 to
 get
 it


back.


[music]


It's
 Tuesday.
 January
 [music]
 13th.


Anatoli,
 we're
 here
 today
 to
 talk
 to
 you


about
 Trump's
 interest
 in
 Venezuelan


oil.
 And
 the
 reason
 that
 we
 are
 again


turning
 to
 you
 is
 that
 you
 famously
 for


some
 of
 us
 former
 Latin
 America


correspondents
 spent
 nearly
 a
 decade
 in


Venezuela
 covering
 the
 country
 when


Maduro
 first
 came
 to
 power.
 And
 you
 are


a
 student
 of
 and
 our
 in-house
 expert
 on


Venezuelan
 oil.
 So,
 welcome
 back
 to
 the


show.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me
 again,
 Natalie.


>> Let's
 just
 start
 with
 a
 basic
 question,


which
 is
 why
 is
 Trump
 so
 focused
 on


Venezuelan
 oil?


>> Venezuela
 is
 a
 quintessential
 prostate.


It
 is
 arguably
 the
 first
 prostate.
 It
 is


a
 nation
 that
 has
 been
 built
 by
 oil
 that


defines
 itself
 through
 oil.
 And
 if
 you
 a


American
 president
 who
 sees
 the
 world


through
 prism
 of
 natural
 resources,
 who


sees
 the
 world
 through
 the
 geopolitics


of
 energy
 and
 control
 of
 energy


resources,
 then
 Venezuela
 is
 your


natural
 target.
 As
 my
 colleague
 Rebecca


Elliot
 wrote,
 you
 have
 a
 country
 that
 is


today
 the
 world's
 largest
 oil
 producer,


the
 United
 States,
 targeting
 the
 country


with
 the
 world's
 biggest
 oil
 reserves,


Venezuela.
 It
 is
 in
 a
 way
 a
 natural


relationship,
 a
 natural
 tango.
 Of


course,
 shaped
 by
 drama,
 shaped
 by


cooperation,
 by
 competition,
 by
 all


sorts
 of
 conflicts,
 but
 it
 is
 a


collision
 of
 two
 countries
 that
 are
 in


different
 ways
 shaped
 by
 oil,


>> right?
 And
 it's
 difficult
 obviously
 to


get
 inside
 the
 president's
 head,
 but
 we


do
 have
 his
 public
 statements
 on
 this,


right?
 He's
 gone
 out
 and
 offered
 a
 very


explicit
 justification
 for
 some
 of
 this,


which
 is
 he's
 saying
 this
 is
 going
 to


make
 the
 US
 and
 Venezuela
 a
 lot
 of


money.


>> Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 For
 us
 as
 reporters,


one
 of
 the
 most
 shocking
 or
 unexpected


elements
 of
 this
 whole
 drama,
 just
 how


explicit,
 how
 direct
 Trump
 is
 being


about
 his
 motives.
 the
 central
 the


driving
 aspect
 of
 this
 whole
 campaign


against
 Venezuelan
 President
 Nicholas


Maduro
 is
 about
 oil.
 This
 is
 the


crucifix
 of
 this
 entire
 issue.
 And
 the


other
 thing
 that
 he's
 been
 saying
 other


than
 this
 is
 about
 oil.
 We
 can
 make


money
 on
 this
 is
 that
 this
 is
 rightfully


ours
 that
 the
 US
 has
 a
 claim
 to
 this


oil.
 So
 walk
 me
 through
 those


statements.
 What
 are
 he
 and
 his
 allies


saying
 there
 really?
 Well,
 this
 is


perhaps
 the
 most
 contentious
 and
 complex


parts
 of
 the
 story
 that
 Trump
 is
 saying


that
 the
 US
 is
 reclaiming
 what's


rightfully
 theirs,
 what's
 rightfully


America's.
 And
 this
 sentiment
 has
 been


echoed
 by
 his
 officials.
 You
 know,
 his


top
 advisor
 Steven
 Miller
 has
 said,
 and


I'm
 quoting,
 American
 sweat,
 ingenuity,


and
 toil
 created
 the
 oil
 industry
 in


Venezuela.
 It's
 tyrannical
 expropriation


was
 the
 largest
 recorded
 theft
 of


American
 wealth
 and
 [clears throat]


property.


>> Right?
 I
 remember
 that
 post
 from
 Miller.


It
 was
 quite
 strident
 and
 direct.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 really
 wild
 and
 exaggerated


and
 incendury,
 but
 it
 does
 contain
 a


grain
 of
 truth.
 And
 to
 understand


where
 he
 comes
 from,
 you
 have
 to
 go
 back


all
 the
 way
 back
 to
 the
 beginning
 of


Venezuela's
 oil
 industry
 a
 century
 ago.


>> Okay,
 take
 me
 there.
 Tell
 me
 that
 story.


I
 want
 to
 understand
 where
 the
 grain
 of


truth
 in
 that
 statement
 really
 is.


[music]


When
 Columbus
 discovered
 Venezuela
 500


years
 ago,
 he
 thought
 he'd
 found
 an


earthly
 paradise.


>> Venezuela
 was
 a
 land
 of
 mountains,


plains,
 and
 jungles,
 and
 with
 only
 a


handful
 of
 Spanish
 towns
 and
 villages.


[music]


>> So
 before
 the
 oil
 was
 discovered,


Venezuela
 was
 sparssely
 populated,


underdeveloped,
 full
 of
 poverty,
 and


very
 little
 infrastructure.


>> The
 first
 Europeans
 came
 to
 Venezuela


seeking
 gold.
 They
 later
 found
 black


gold,
 crude
 oil.
 On
 December
 14th,
 1922,


an
 oil
 well
 being
 drilled
 near
 Lake


Maraco
 blew
 out
 at
 the
 rate
 of
 100,000


barrels
 a
 day.


>> Oil
 was
 discovered
 in
 Venezuela
 at
 the


very
 beginning
 of
 the
 20th
 century
 and


the
 industry
 really
 takes
 off
 in
 the


1920s.
 The
 boom
 that
 was
 propelled
 a
 few


years
 later
 [music]
 by
 mass
 migration
 of


American
 oil
 workers.


>> Foreign
 oil
 companies
 operate
 the
 wells.


And
 those
 American
 oil
 workers,
 they


started
 building
 towns
 built
 in
 the


American
 way
 with
 [music]
 American


grids,
 suburban
 houses,
 schools,


baseball,
 social
 [music]
 activities,


churches.
 And
 those
 towns
 gradually
 grew


into
 cities
 and
 then
 metropolises
 again


imitating
 American
 way
 of
 life.


>> Oil
 workers
 like
 Juan
 Ramirez
 with
 their


high
 salaries
 and
 many
 company
 benefits


[music]
 have
 achieved
 a
 way
 of
 life


which
 is
 very
 similar
 to
 that
 of
 workers


in
 the
 most
 advanced
 countries
 of
 Europe


and
 North
 America.
 Local
 employees
 which


are
 hired
 by
 American
 oil
 companies


become
 [music]
 the
 backbone
 of
 a
 new


middle
 class.


>> The
 Ramirez
 family
 lives
 in
 a
 modern


community
 planned
 and
 built
 by
 the
 oil


company.


>> The
 oil
 money
 has
 been
 spent
 on
 public


buildings,
 skyscrapers,
 broad
 avenues,


and
 highways.


>> The
 streets
 became
 highways.
 The
 social


clubs
 became
 malls.
 The
 suburban
 houses


became
 skyscrapers.
 Venezuela's
 oil


capital,
 Marako,
 in
 the
 west
 is
 known


here
 as
 the
 Houston
 of
 Venezuela.
 M


>> the
 hope
 is
 that
 the
 future
 holds
 more


jobs,
 better
 living
 standards,
 better


homes.


>> Venezuela
 basically
 answering
 modernity


through
 the
 prison
 of
 how
 American
 oil


workers
 saw
 the
 world.


>> To
 Venezuela's
 people,
 oil
 is


everything.


>> Wow.
 It's
 interesting.
 You're
 saying


basically
 that
 the
 Americans
 left
 a
 huge


mark
 on
 Venezuela
 and
 not
 just
 seen
 in


the
 oil
 industry
 itself,
 but
 all
 over


the
 country.
 It's
 funny
 what
 you're


saying
 about
 the
 architecture
 does
 ring


true.
 I
 haven't
 spent
 that
 much
 time
 in


Caracus,
 but
 it's
 right
 that
 it
 looks


more
 like
 an
 American
 capital
 than
 you'd


see
 elsewhere
 in
 Latin
 America.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 after
 the
 influx
 of


American
 workers,
 American
 capital,
 the


oil
 production
 starts
 to
 rise
 rapidly.


And
 in
 the
 1950s,
 Venezuela
 was
 the


world's
 largest
 oil
 exporter.
 It
 is


making
 tremendous
 amounts
 of
 money.
 And


Venezuela's
 dictator
 at
 the
 time,
 Marcos


Paris
 Jimenez,
 he
 uses
 that
 oil
 wealth


and
 pours
 it
 into
 the
 country's


infrastructure.
 He
 starts
 building


massive
 tunnels,
 bridges,
 highways.


Venezuela
 becomes
 filled
 with
 this


massive
 grandiose
 projects
 that
 put
 it


way
 ahead
 of
 its
 peers
 in
 Latin
 America.


It
 becomes
 one
 of
 the
 richest
 countries


in
 the
 region,
 arguably
 one
 of
 the


richest
 countries
 in
 the
 world.
 And
 it


starts
 to
 attract
 migration
 from
 all


across
 the
 world,
 from
 other
 corners
 of


Latin
 America,
 from
 Asia,
 from
 southern


Europe,
 from
 Lebanon.
 Venezuela
 becomes


this
 melting
 pot
 of
 cultures,
 all
 drawn


to
 the
 wealth
 provided
 by
 the
 oil


industry
 that
 is
 fueling
 the
 economy,


fueling
 the
 country's
 development
 and


reshaping
 it
 as
 this
 mecca
 of
 modernity


at
 a
 region
 that
 was
 still
 extremely


poor
 and
 backward
 at
 the
 time.
 So


obviously
 there
 is
 a
 clear
 benefit
 for


Venezuelans
 in
 all
 of
 this.
 They're


reaping
 rewards
 from
 this
 boom,
 but


they're
 also
 seeing
 that
 there's
 a
 bunch


of
 foreign
 companies,
 right,
 making
 a


lot
 of
 money
 off
 of
 selling
 what
 is


their
 main
 natural
 resource.
 So
 as
 good


as
 those
 times
 may
 have
 been,
 was
 there


any
 tension
 there?


>> There
 was.
 There's
 a
 growing
 number
 of


Venezuelans
 began
 to
 question
 the
 the


status
 quo
 which
 gives
 the
 bulk
 of
 the


wealth
 towards
 the
 corporations
 and


Venezuela
 really
 becomes
 the
 driver
 of
 a


movement
 that
 ended
 up
 shaping
 the


world.
 A
 movement
 called
 resource


nationalism.


>> And
 what
 is
 that?
 What's
 resource


nationalism?


>> This
 is
 a
 concept
 that
 states
 that


ultimately
 natural
 resources
 belongs
 to


the
 citizens
 of
 a
 state.
 That
 the


country's
 national
 wealth
 belongs
 to
 its


people
 and
 not
 to
 the
 corporations
 that


are
 exploiting
 these
 resources.
 Hm.
 And


when
 is
 this
 taking
 hold?
 Just
 give
 me
 a


sense
 of
 time
 here.
 [snorts]


>> So
 in
 late
 50s
 a
 Venezuelan
 statesman


called
 Juan
 Pablo
 Peris
 Alonso
 travels


to
 the
 Middle
 East.


He
 goes
 to
 the
 other
 world
 producing


nations
 and
 convinces
 them
 if
 we
 bond


together,
 if
 we
 stick
 together,
 we
 can


assert
 our
 sovereignty,
 we
 can
 bring


more
 wealth
 to
 our
 people
 and
 we
 can


minimize
 the
 influence
 of
 corporations


in
 our
 society.
 And
 this
 becomes
 OPAC


which
 is
 basically
 a
 group
 of
 oil


nations
 that
 together
 agree
 on
 how
 much


oil
 is
 produced
 between
 them
 thereby


setting
 the
 prices
 and
 setting
 the
 pace


of
 a
 global
 economy.
 The
 idea
 behind


this
 association,
 which
 it
 sounds
 like


Venezuela
 [music]
 is
 key
 to
 helping


create,
 is
 that
 these
 countries
 are


going
 to
 agree
 on
 how
 many
 barrels
 they


want
 to
 be
 in
 the
 supply
 and
 that
 that


will
 affect
 prices,
 giving
 them
 some


control
 over
 the
 revenues
 they're


reaping
 from
 this
 [music]
 production.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 the
 second
 crucial


pillar
 of
 resource
 nationalism
 is


[music]


ownership
 of
 resources.
 So
 it
 starts
 a


chain
 of
 legal
 reforms
 that
 assert
 that


what
 lays
 underground
 belongs
 [music]
 to


the
 states


>> and
 it
 culminates
 in
 Venezuela
 in
 the


1970s
 when
 a
 sensor
 left
 pro-
 US


president
 at
 the
 time
 Carlos
 Andres


Paris
 decides
 to
 nationalize
 Venezuela's


oil
 industry.


>> [music]


>> And
 what
 is
 the
 nationalization
 of


Venezuela's
 oil
 actually
 look
 like?
 How


does
 that
 play
 out?


>> So,
 Carson
 Paris
 chooses
 a
 relatively


consiliatory
 path.
 This
 is
 a
 cold
 war.


Venezuela
 is
 deeply
 allied
 the
 United


States.
 So
 he
 starts
 talking
 to
 the
 oil


companies.
 He
 works
 out
 an
 agreement


where
 the
 oil
 companies
 are
 compensated


and
 are
 offered
 contracts
 under
 which


they
 can
 continue
 making
 a
 lot
 of
 money.


And
 nationalization
 creates
 a
 company


called
 Petroleios
 the
 Venezuela
 a


stateowned
 company
 known
 here


universally
 as
 Pedvesa
 which
 now
 owns


all
 of
 Venezuela's
 oil.
 And
 how
 do


Venezuelans
 feel
 about
 this?


>> Nationalization
 becomes
 the
 source
 of


national
 pride.
 It
 becomes
 one
 of


Venezuela's
 foundational
 myths.
 It


becomes
 an
 event
 that
 divides
 Venezuelan


history
 and
 before
 and
 after.
 What


Venezuelan
 people
 asserting
 control
 over


their
 wealth
 over
 what
 they
 consider


their
 birthrights
 the
 oil
 under
 the


ground.
 And
 this
 company
 grows
 and
 is


working
 together
 with
 foreign
 oil


companies
 and
 it's
 using
 some
 of
 the


revenues
 to
 train
 Venezuelans
 in
 the
 oil


industry.
 It
 is
 using
 the
 money
 to
 send


Venezuelans
 on
 scholarship
 to
 world's


best
 universities
 and
 it
 becomes
 a


fairly
 effective
 modern
 company
 that
 is


at
 the
 cutting
 edge
 of
 the
 technology
 of


the
 time.
 It
 was
 a
 place
 where


Venezuelan
 middle
 class
 where


Venezuela's
 professional
 class
 had


formed
 itself
 and
 it
 becomes
 the


cornerstone
 of
 Venezuelan
 society
 and


oil
 prices
 are
 at
 their
 peak.
 The


country
 is
 flooded
 with
 money
 with
 much


of
 that
 wealth
 going
 into
 education
 and


alleviation
 of
 poverty.
 And
 at
 you've


described
 this
 long
 tale
 of
 history


where
 American
 oilmen
 came
 in,
 worked


the
 fields
 in
 Venezuela,
 got
 this


incredible
 industry
 up
 and
 running.
 And


it
 sounds
 like
 Venezuelans
 really


actually
 gained
 a
 lot
 from
 the


partnership
 and
 and
 from
 the


nationalization
 that
 came
 from
 it.
 They


got
 this
 setup
 where
 their
 national


company
 runs
 things,
 where
 it's
 working


with
 foreign
 companies,
 and
 it's
 fueling


pretty
 remarkable
 development.


>> That's
 right.
 It
 was
 a
 blessing,
 but
 it


was
 also
 a
 curse.


Venezuela
 became
 addicted
 to
 oil.
 Its


economy
 became
 extremely
 dependent
 on


oil.
 And
 then
 in
 the
 80s,
 the
 global


economy
 changed
 and
 the
 oil
 prices


starts
 to
 go
 down.
 The
 price
 of
 a
 barrel


drops
 from
 $40
 to
 $10.
 Wow,
 that's


pretty
 massive
 if
 you're
 depending
 on


this.


>> It's
 a
 massive
 decline,
 Natalie.
 And


cracks
 begin
 to
 appear
 in
 Venezuela's


economic
 model.
 Venezuela
 goes
 from
 a


period
 of
 abundance
 where
 the
 state


lavished
 money
 on
 a
 welfare
 state
 to
 a


period
 of
 scarcity
 where
 money
 is


scarce,
 where
 public
 spending
 is
 scars,


corruption
 scandals
 grow,
 and
 people


become
 increasingly
 disillusioned
 and


angry
 with
 the
 system.


>> [music]


>> So
 what
 does
 the
 Venezuelan
 government


do?
 How
 do
 they
 respond
 to
 this
 crisis?


>> The
 government's
 solution
 to
 this
 anger


is
 more
 oil.
 [music]
 They
 turn
 to
 a


remote
 region
 of
 a
 country
 called
 the


Arino
 oil
 belt
 which
 contains
 the


world's
 largest
 oil
 reserves.
 But
 these


reserves
 are
 locked
 in
 sludgy
 tar
 that


is
 extremely
 difficult
 to
 process
 and
 it


requires
 cutting
 edge
 technology
 to
 make


it
 sellable
 which
 Venezuela
 does
 not


have
 at
 the
 time
 but
 American


corporations
 do.
 [music]


So
 Venezuelan
 government
 turns
 to


foreign
 investors
 turns
 to
 foreign


multinationals
 to
 help
 them
 unlock
 the


wealth
 hidden
 in
 this
 remote
 region


[snorts]
 and
 they
 call
 this
 process


[music]
 a
 perura
 petrolera
 the
 oil


opening.
 It
 is
 natally
 one
 of
 the
 most


ambitious
 oil
 investments
 program
 in
 the


world
 at
 the
 time.


And
 Pervesa,
 the
 state
 oil
 company
 that


has
 been
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 Venezuelan


economy,
 the
 heart
 of
 its
 public
 life,


takes
 the
 back
 seat
 and
 allows
 foreign


companies
 to
 take
 the
 leads
 on
 the


development
 of
 these
 reserves
 and
 take


the
 leads
 on
 monetizing
 the
 profits
 from


these
 reserves.


>> And
 does
 it
 work?
 Does
 that
 arrangement


actually
 yield
 anything?


>> The
 oil
 starts
 to
 flow.
 Production


starts
 to
 increase
 rapidly
 and
 reaches


more
 than
 3
 million
 barrels
 from
 about
 1


and
 a
 half
 million
 by
 1998.
 But
 the


economic
 stability
 never
 comes
 back.


>> People
 feel
 that
 the
 oil
 industry
 no


longer
 serves
 the
 national
 interests
 and


people
 start
 to
 look
 for
 solutions


elsewhere


and
 it
 fuels
 the
 rise
 of
 one
 of
 the
 most


important
 politicians
 in
 modern
 Latin


American
 history.


an
 army
 officer
 called
 Chavez.


[music]


[music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Okay,
 let's
 talk
 about
 who
 Ugo
 Chavez
 is


and
 what
 his
 role
 is
 in
 this
 moment.


>> So,
 Ugo
 Chavez
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 poor
 family


in
 Venezuelan
 Savana.
 And
 like
 many


working-class
 children
 in
 Venezuela,
 he


saw
 his
 chance
 to
 succeed
 in
 life
 in
 the


armed
 forces.
 He
 joins
 a
 military


academy
 and
 rises
 rapidly
 for
 the
 ranks


using
 his
 sharp
 intellect
 and
 charisma.


At
 the
 same
 time,
 he
 becomes
 influenced


by
 nationalist
 and
 socialist
 ideas


floating
 around
 during
 the
 Cold
 War.
 And


in
 1998,


>> he
 launches
 a
 political
 campaign
 that


takes
 the
 country
 by
 storm,
 capturing


support
 from
 all
 segments
 of
 Venezuelan


society.


>> And
 what's
 his
 message
 in
 this
 campaign?


His


message
 is
 Venezuelan
 oil
 belongs
 to


Venezuelan
 people.
 And
 he
 rallies


against
 Pervesa,
 the
 state
 oil
 company


that
 he
 sees
 has
 become
 basically
 a


thief
 of
 western
 interests,
 a
 thief
 of


Venezuelan
 elites
 that
 have
 lost
 touch


with
 the
 people
 that
 are
 serving
 by
 our


own
 interests
 that
 have
 turned
 Pavvesa


into
 little
 country
 club
 for
 the
 rich


and
 the
 privileged.
 [cheering]


And
 Chavis
 wins
 56%
 of
 a
 popular
 vote.


Many
 Venezuelans
 rejoice
 when
 he
 becomes


president
 in
 1999.


>> And
 after
 he
 wins,
 how
 does
 he
 make
 good


on
 those
 campaign
 promises?


>> So
 his
 first
 big
 project
 is


redistribution
 of
 insulin's
 wealth.
 And


that
 means
 restructuring
 completely
 the


way
 PVESA
 works,
 the
 cash
 cow
 of
 the


economy.
 And
 this
 sets
 Chavis
 on
 a
 crash


course
 against
 the
 company's
 management,


the
 high
 priests
 of
 Venezuelan
 oil


industry,
 the
 western
 educated


technocrats
 that
 have
 been
 running
 the


Venezuelan
 oil
 industry
 for
 decades.


Linia.


>> In
 2002,
 Chambers
 goes
 on
 national


television,
 pretends
 to
 be
 a
 soccer


referee,
 blows
 the
 whistle,
 and
 fires


senior
 executives.


>> Offside.


Offside.


>> He
 says,
 "You
 are
 offside."


>> When
 Chavez
 replaced
 the
 oil
 company's


top
 [music]
 executives
 with
 political


appointees,
 some
 of
 whom
 were
 radical


Marxists,
 there
 was
 a
 management
 revolt.


And
 this
 fuels
 nationwide
 protest
 that


brought
 the
 country
 throughout
 [music]


2002.


This
 is
 a
 crucial
 moment
 in
 Venezuela's


history
 because
 many
 of
 the
 country's


middle
 class
 realize
 that
 this
 is
 a


power
 grab.
 These
 people
 who
 have
 for


generations
 seen
 as
 a
 pedesta
 as
 a
 model


of
 national
 development,
 they
 see
 it


being
 taken
 apart
 for
 a
 political


project
 without
 any
 consideration
 for


accountability
 or
 democratic
 [music]


norms.
 And
 the
 year
 culminates
 with
 a


massive
 oil
 strike.
 Pedesta
 workers


paralyze
 the
 country.
 Exports
 stop.
 The


country
 runs
 out
 of
 gasoline.
 The


country
 is
 in
 chaos.
 and
 tens
 of


thousands
 of
 workers,
 including
 most
 of


the
 company's
 skilled
 workforce,
 walk


out
 of
 [music]
 jobs,
 basically


paralyzing
 the
 Venezuelan
 economy.


>> And
 how
 does
 Chavez
 respond?


>> He
 fires
 thousands
 of
 Venezuelan


workers,
 primarily
 managers
 and
 skilled


workers,
 people
 that
 supported
 the


strike,
 but
 also
 people
 that
 made
 the


company
 tick,
 people
 that
 made
 it


competitive
 and
 efficient.
 and
 he
 turns


a
 company
 into
 just
 another
 tool
 of
 his


political
 populist
 campaign.
 And
 all
 of


a
 sudden,
 this
 company,
 but
 it's
 known


for
 its
 technological
 expertise
 and


efficiency,
 starts
 opening
 supermarkets,


providing
 daycare,
 uh
 hosting
 theater


performances.


>> Well,
 like
 like
 theater
 sponsored
 by


Pedesa,
 like
 sponsored
 by
 your
 state
 oil


company.
 It's
 hard
 to
 think
 of
 a


cultural
 social
 activity
 or
 a
 product


that
 you
 buy
 that
 has
 not
 been
 sponsored


or
 sold
 by
 pedesta
 at
 the
 time.
 It's


literally
 just
 becomes
 the
 provider
 of


social
 services
 and
 welfare
 in
 the


country.
 And
 corruption
 also
 increases.


Many
 of
 government
 insiders,
 many
 people


close
 to
 Chavis
 become
 big
 oil
 industry


contractors
 providing
 PBESA
 with


services
 and
 goods
 that
 are
 overpriced


in
 return
 for
 political
 loyalty.
 So
 this


state-owned
 company
 that
 was
 such
 a


source
 of
 national
 pride,
 this
 crown


jewel
 has
 now
 been
 gutted
 basically
 of


the
 expertise
 and
 the
 technical
 knowhow


that
 made
 it
 work
 that
 made
 it
 so


functional
 for
 so
 long.


>> That's
 right.
 Its
 revenues
 fall
 and


production
 begins
 to
 decline
 and
 Chavis


needs
 to
 look
 for
 other
 sources
 of


revenue.
 It
 needs
 to
 look
 for
 other


sources
 of
 wealth
 that
 fund
 his
 populist


projects.
 So
 in
 2007
 he
 launches
 another


wave
 of
 nationalizations.
 He
 takes
 aim


at
 the
 oil
 opening
 via
 a
 perura.


Remember
 those
 international
 oil


companies
 that
 have
 spent
 billions
 to


refine
 the
 tar
 crude
 locked
 or
 inino
 oil


belt?


>> The
 Chavez
 government
 has
 told
 its


foreign
 partners
 that
 they
 must
 agree
 by


May
 1st
 to
 give
 Pabesa
 a
 60%
 stake
 in


those
 joint
 ventures
 or
 see
 them


nationalized
 altogether.


>> Well,
 Chavis
 decides
 that
 [music]
 these


projects
 now
 belong
 to
 the
 state.
 He


forces
 the
 companies
 to
 give
 up
 control


of
 his
 projects
 and
 give
 state
 majority


share.


>> We
 will
 never
 give
 this
 our
 wealth,
 our


nation
 to
 the
 United
 States
 empire.
 Even


if
 the
 Venezuelan
 oligarchs
 scream
 or
 if


the
 United
 States
 and
 its
 multinational


companies
 attacks
 us
 [music]
 and
 two


major
 oil
 companies,
 companies
 that


became
 Exxon
 Mobile
 and
 Kanuka
 Phillips


refuse.
 Exon
 Mobile
 wants
 to
 be


compensated
 for
 the
 investments
 it
 lost


when
 Chavis
 nationalized
 the
 country's


oil
 venture.


>> They
 leave
 Venezuela
 and
 start
 a
 series


of
 legal
 processes
 that
 end
 up
 awarding


them
 billions
 of
 dollars
 in
 damages
 that


these
 companies
 continue
 to
 claim
 have


been
 stolen
 from
 them
 by
 the
 Chavis


government.


So
 unlike
 the
 first
 wave
 of


nationalization
 in
 the
 1970s,
 which
 you


said
 led
 to
 a
 relatively
 functional


partnership
 between
 the
 Venezuelan


government
 and
 foreign
 oil
 companies,


this
 wave
 is
 a
 lot
 more
 contentious.
 And


I
 wonder,
 is
 this
 what
 Trump
 and
 his


aids
 are
 referring
 to
 when
 they
 talk


about
 Venezuela
 stealing
 from
 American


oil
 companies?
 Like,
 is
 this
 the
 moment


that
 they're
 referring
 to?
 We
 don't


know.
 But
 it
 is
 a
 moment
 when
 Venezuela


came
 closest
 of
 defrauding
 American


companies,
 came
 closest
 to
 taking
 away


the
 money
 that
 American
 companies
 have


claimed
 is
 rightfully
 theirs.
 But
 there


was
 an
 exception.
 Chevron,
 an
 oil


company
 that
 decided
 to
 accept
 much
 less


profitable
 terms,
 knowing
 that
 in
 the


long
 term
 they
 stand
 to
 win.
 The
 country


had
 the
 biggest
 oil
 reserves
 in
 the


world.
 So
 even
 if
 there
 was
 a
 small


chance
 that
 those
 reserves
 would
 fall


into
 company's
 hands,
 it
 would
 create
 a


massive
 amount
 of
 wealth
 for
 the


corporation
 and
 its
 shareholders.


>> Okay.
 So
 at
 this
 point,
 Pedesa
 is
 a


shell
 of
 its
 former
 self.
 The
 American


companies
 are
 all
 gone
 except
 for


Chevron
 and
 Venezuela
 is
 now
 sitting
 on


this
 massive
 oil
 reserve
 without
 really


the
 capacity
 to
 realize
 the
 potential.


the
 infrastructure,
 the
 institutions,


they
 just
 don't
 really
 exist
 anymore.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 when
 Chavis
 dies
 in


2013,
 the
 rickety
 populist
 economic


system
 that
 he
 has
 built
 falls
 apart


like
 a
 house
 of
 cards.
 [music]


All
 prices
 fall
 and
 with
 it
 the


Venezuelan
 economy.
 Starting
 2014,
 it


enters
 a
 prolonged
 period
 of
 economic


decline
 of
 collapse
 that
 ended
 up
 being


the
 biggest
 economic
 crisis
 in
 modern


history
 outside
 a
 war
 zone.
 After
 17


years
 of
 socialist
 rule,
 Venezuela,
 one


of
 the
 world's
 largest
 oil
 producers,


has
 the
 world's
 highest
 inflation
 rate.


>> With
 basic
 necessities
 scarce
 and


inflation
 skyrocketing,
 some
 reports


suggest
 it
 [music]
 could
 go
 as
 high
 as


700%.


>> And
 that
 crisis
 spreads
 to
 the
 oil


industry.
 It
 becomes
 a
 shell
 of
 itself.


Wells
 dry
 up,
 investments
 dry
 up,
 and


people
 are
 scrambling
 around
 oil
 fields,


taking
 apart
 the
 infrastructure,
 taking


apart
 pipelines,
 the
 fences,
 the


equipment
 for
 scrap.
 Venezuela's
 vet
 oil


fields
 become
 a
 scene
 out
 of
 a
 dystopian


movie.


>> It's
 kind
 of
 wild
 to
 imagine
 when
 you


just
 think
 about
 how
 much
 money
 and
 time


and
 effort
 went
 into
 building
 all
 of


that
 stuff
 to
 have
 it
 basically
 be
 torn


apart
 and
 sold
 for
 parts.
 I
 mean,
 things


had
 to
 have
 been
 really
 bad
 at
 that


point.


>> People
 are
 struggling
 to
 survive.


Natalie,


>> the
 people
 of
 Venezuela
 are
 suffering


from
 violence,
 a
 world
 record
 of
 daily


murders,
 and
 random
 kidnappings.


>> Malnutrition
 rises
 massively.
 Many


people
 are
 skipping
 the
 meal.


>> I'm
 very
 annoyed.
 [music]
 Only
 God
 knows


what
 we're
 going
 through
 because
 in


truth,
 no
 one
 is
 helping
 us.
 The


situation
 is
 so
 severe,
 the
 New
 York


Times
 reports
 it's
 even
 making
 it
 hard


for
 doctors
 to
 keep
 newborn
 babies


alive.


>> Millions
 of
 people
 immigrate
 from
 a


country.
 It
 is
 difficult
 to
 imagine
 the


scale
 of
 collapse
 that
 [music]
 the


country
 has
 experienced,
 losing
 more


than
 3/4
 of
 its
 economic
 activity


without
 a
 war,
 without
 social
 unrest,


without
 a
 major
 natural
 [music]


catastrophe.
 All
 caused
 by
 the
 populist


policies
 instituted
 by
 Uga
 Chavez
 and


continued
 by
 his
 successor
 Nicholas


Maduro.
 [music]


And
 this
 is
 a
 huge
 blow
 obviously
 for
 a


movement
 that
 has
 made
 its
 name
 selling


itself
 as
 a
 leftist
 movement
 that
 cares


about
 the
 people
 that
 is
 working
 to


prevent
 this
 kind
 of
 poverty
 from
 making


people
 suffer.
 So
 what's
 the
 response?


>> So
 initially
 the
 government
 tries
 to


just
 chug
 along
 repressing
 protest
 and


doubling
 down
 on
 the
 failed
 policies


that
 have
 brought
 the
 country
 to
 its


economic
 knees.
 But
 then
 President
 Trump


starts
 his
 first
 term
 and
 he
 launches
 a


campaign
 to
 depose
 Mr.
 Maduro
 and
 his


biggest
 blow
 was
 sanctioning
 Venezuelan


oil
 industry.
 Basically
 making
 it


illegal
 for
 Venezuela
 to
 sell
 its
 oil
 to


the
 west.
 This
 paralyzes
 Venezuelan
 oil


experts
 and
 paralyzes
 economic
 activity


deepening
 the
 crisis
 and
 it
 forces


Maduro
 to
 change
 tac.
 He
 entrusts
 one
 of


his
 top
 lieutenants,
 Dust
 Rodriguez,
 to


fix
 the
 economy.


>> Now
 the
 leader
 of
 Venezuela.
 now
 the


leader
 of
 Venezuela
 and
 she
 embarks
 on
 a


long
 campaign
 to
 steady
 the
 economy
 and


the
 pillar
 of
 her
 campaign
 is
 to
 change


the
 oil
 industry
 and
 she
 does
 it
 by


launching
 stealth
 privatization.
 On


paper,
 the
 oil
 continues
 to
 belong
 to


Venezuelan
 people
 and
 the
 state
 has
 the


dominant
 role
 in
 Venezuelan
 oil


projects.
 But
 in
 practice,
 under
 the


secret
 contracts
 signed
 by
 Deli,
 foreign


companies
 gain
 control
 of
 Venezuelan
 oil


fields.
 They
 get
 to
 make
 all
 the


decisions
 about
 them
 and
 they
 given
 a


bigger
 share
 of
 his
 project's
 profits.


Investment
 picks
 up
 and
 so
 does
 the
 oil


production.
 And
 by
 the
 end
 of
 2025,
 the


country
 is
 producing
 1.2
 million
 barrels


per
 day,
 a
 fraction
 of
 where
 it
 was


before
 Chavis
 took
 power.
 but
 a


significant
 improvement
 to
 where
 the


country
 was
 just
 a
 few
 years
 ago.


>> Okay.
 So
 at
 present
 you're
 saying
 things


are
 certainly
 not
 as
 dire
 as
 they
 were


but
 in
 general
 the
 story
 that
 you've


told
 overall
 paints
 a
 picture
 of
 extreme


decay
 in
 this
 industry
 in
 the


infrastructure
 around
 it.
 An
 industry


that
 is
 very
 difficult
 to
 just
 start


back
 up
 overnight
 when
 you
 start
 to
 lose


it
 given
 how
 much
 it
 takes
 to
 make
 it


work.
 Trump
 is
 now
 saying
 after
 having


captured
 Maduro,
 after
 supporting
 Deli,


now
 as
 the
 leader,
 that
 US
 companies
 are


going
 to
 revive
 Venezuela's
 oil


industry.
 What
 would
 it
 take
 to
 actually


do
 that
 right
 now?


>> It
 would
 take
 tens
 of
 billions
 of


dollars
 of
 investment.
 Dela
 Rodriguez


was
 able
 to
 reverse
 the
 decline
 and
 edge


up
 the
 production
 by
 taking
 the


lowhanging
 fruits,
 by
 fixing
 things
 that


were
 easier
 to
 fix.
 And
 many
 oil


executives
 and
 analysts
 say
 that
 these


lowhanging
 fruits
 are
 coming
 to
 an
 end.


That
 for
 Venezuela
 to
 significantly


improve
 its
 oil
 production
 to
 take
 it
 to


a
 whole
 other
 level
 would
 require
 a


massive
 [snorts]
 scale
 investment
 that


the
 country
 has
 not
 had
 for
 decades.
 But


there
 is
 good
 news
 for
 the
 oil
 companies


and
 that
 is
 that
 everyone
 knows
 where


that
 oil
 is.
 The
 hard
 part,
 the


exploration
 has
 already
 been
 done.
 The


difficulty
 is
 getting
 it
 out
 of
 the


ground.
 Remember
 that
 most
 of
 oil


reserves
 lie
 in
 the
 sludgy
 area
 called


the
 UNokco
 oil
 belt
 and
 the
 cutting
 edge


multi-billion
 dollar
 plants
 that
 were


used
 to
 process
 them
 have
 largely
 been


decayed
 and
 disintegrated.
 The
 thing


about
 the
 oil
 industry
 Natalie
 is
 that


you
 cannot
 just
 turn
 the
 spigot
 back
 on.


Once
 something
 decays,
 once
 something


falls
 apart,
 it
 often
 damages
 the


geological
 receptacle
 holding
 the
 oil


and
 it's
 extremely
 expensive
 and


timeconuming
 to
 repair
 the


infrastructure
 to
 repair
 the
 reservoirs


and
 make
 the
 oil
 flow
 again.


>> And
 is
 doing
 that
 actually
 appealing
 to


American
 oil
 executives?
 Like
 do
 they


actually
 want
 this
 challenge?
 That
 is


the
 main
 question
 right
 now,
 Natalie,


just
 how
 committed
 the
 companies
 will
 be


to
 taking
 another
 bat
 on
 Venezuela.


Taking
 another
 battle
 on
 a
 country
 that


has
 burned
 them
 badly
 in
 the
 past.
 So


there's
 still
 a
 lot
 of
 unknowns,
 but
 the


cost
 of
 sitting
 on
 the
 sidelines
 is


massive.
 At
 stake
 are
 literally
 the


world's
 largest
 oil
 reserves.
 Just
 last


week,
 Trump
 met
 the
 executives
 of
 some


of
 the
 biggest
 Western
 oil
 companies
 to


talk
 about
 investment
 in
 Venezuela.
 The


plan
 is
 for
 them
 to
 spend,
 meaning
 our


giant
 oil
 companies
 will
 be
 spending
 at


least
 $100
 billion
 dollars
 of
 their


money,
 not
 the
 government's
 money.


>> And
 the
 broad
 takeaway
 was
 that
 while


Trump
 made
 big
 promises,
 touting
 100


billion
 investments
 in
 the
 country,


companies
 themselves
 showed
 interest.


>> For
 more
 than
 a
 century,
 Chevron
 has


been
 a
 part
 of
 Venezuela's
 past.
 uh
 we


are
 certainly
 committed
 to
 its
 uh


present
 and
 we
 very
 much
 look
 forward
 as


a
 proud
 American
 company
 to
 help
 it


build
 a
 better
 future.


>> But
 remain
 cautious


>> there.
 We
 have
 a
 very
 long
 history
 in


Venezuela.
 In
 fact,
 uh
 we
 first
 got
 into


Venezuela
 back
 in
 1940s.
 Uh
 we've
 had


our
 assets
 seized
 there
 twice
 and
 so
 you


can
 imagine
 to
 reenter
 a
 third
 time


would
 require
 some
 pretty
 significant


changes
 from
 what
 we've
 historically


seen
 here.
 And
 very
 tellingly,
 Axen


Mobile,
 one
 of
 the
 world's
 largest
 oil


companies
 and
 the
 company
 that
 left


Venezuela
 in
 2007
 said
 that


>> if
 we
 look
 at
 the
 legal
 and
 commercial


constructs
 and
 frameworks
 in
 place
 today


in
 Venezuela,
 uh,
 today
 it's


uninvestable.


>> Venezuela
 today
 is
 uninvestable.


Underline
 the
 challenges
 facing
 Trump's


plans
 towards
 the
 country's
 oil


industry.


>> Let's
 get
 into
 some
 of
 those
 challenges.


What
 are
 the
 conditions
 that
 you
 think


need
 to
 be
 present
 for
 these
 companies


to
 come
 back
 and
 to
 make
 the
 kind
 of


sustained
 investments
 that
 you
 would


need
 to
 see
 for
 the
 potential
 of


Venezuela's
 oil
 fields
 to
 actually
 be


realized?


>> So,
 first
 of
 all,
 you
 have
 to
 keep
 in


mind
 that
 Maduro
 has
 been
 gone
 for
 just


about
 a
 week.
 The
 new
 leader
 has


replaced
 them,
 Deli
 Rodriguez,
 she's


basically
 ruling
 through
 the
 guns
 of


American
 warships
 trained
 on
 her


internal
 enemies.


>> [snorts]


>> The
 country
 is
 filled
 with
 armed
 groups


that
 have
 been
 loyal
 to
 Maduro.
 The


country
 is
 filled
 with
 weapons.
 The


country
 is
 filled
 with
 different


political
 factions
 that
 oppose
 Deli


Rodriguez
 and
 her
 policies.
 And
 the
 risk


of
 unrest
 and
 violence
 is
 significant.


>> What
 you're
 describing,
 Anatoli,
 is
 a


situation
 in
 which
 Deli
 formally
 holds


power,
 but
 she's
 also
 contending
 with


these
 internal
 rivals
 and
 particularly


figures
 in
 the
 political
 spectrum
 that


have
 a
 lot
 of
 power.
 not
 only
 over
 the


armed
 forces
 in
 Venezuela,
 but
 over


armed
 groups
 within
 the
 country
 that
 if


she
 doesn't
 control
 them
 and
 if
 her


rivals
 do
 could
 cause
 a
 lot
 of
 trouble.


>> That's
 right.
 She's
 under
 pressure
 to


generate
 wealth,
 to
 please
 the
 Americans


and
 get
 the
 oil
 flowing.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 she's
 trying
 to
 keep
 it
 bay
 the


hardliners
 that
 are
 just
 waiting
 for
 her


one
 wrong
 move
 in
 order
 to
 pounce
 and


undermine
 her
 government.


>> Okay.
 So
 one
 broad
 condition
 for
 foreign


investment
 for
 the
 oil
 companies
 to


return
 to
 Venezuela
 is
 political


stability
 which
 does
 not
 seem
 like
 a


guarantee
 at
 all
 at
 this
 point.
 What


else?


>> Then
 come
 the
 legal
 guarantees.


American
 oil
 companies
 have
 been
 burned


here
 before.
 They
 have
 lost
 billions
 of


dollars
 of
 investments
 and
 they
 want
 to


make
 sure
 that
 this
 will
 not
 happen


again.
 And
 of
 course,
 for
 now,
 President


Trump
 is
 completely
 focused
 on
 getting


Venezuelan
 oil
 into
 the
 ground
 and
 into


the
 United
 States,
 but
 his
 term
 is


running
 out
 in
 three
 years,
 and
 we
 don't


know
 who
 will
 succeed
 him,
 and
 not
 do


the
 oil
 companies.
 And
 this
 uncertainty


and
 the
 scale
 of
 required
 investments
 is


giving
 them
 a
 pause.


>> Right.
 It's
 interesting
 the
 point
 about


Trump
 leaving
 office
 creating
 some


uncertainty
 there
 because
 essentially


what
 you're
 saying
 is
 these
 companies


they
 operate
 on
 very
 long
 timelines.
 So


not
 being
 able
 to
 forecast
 out
 5
 10
 15


years
 in
 the
 future
 that's
 a
 real


liability.


>> It
 is.
 And
 of
 course
 the
 world
 is
 going


through
 an
 electrical
 revolution
 where


the
 structure
 of
 how
 we
 consume
 energy


and
 the
 energy
 we
 need
 is
 changing


dramatically.
 China
 is
 winning
 itself


off
 the
 oil
 by
 moving
 towards
 electric


cars
 and
 sustainable
 energy.
 And
 these


companies
 when
 they
 look
 at
 the
 billions


of
 investments
 that
 have
 to
 be
 made,


they
 are
 thinking
 will
 this
 oil
 be


needed
 in
 1015
 years
 time.


>> Okay,
 just
 to
 enumerate
 these
 conditions


because
 they
 are
 many
 and
 they
 feel


really
 monumental.
 We're
 talking
 about


some
 kind
 of
 understanding
 that
 there


will
 be
 political
 stability
 inside


Venezuela
 and
 a
 consistent
 desire
 and


ability
 to
 collaborate
 with
 the
 United


States
 as
 well
 as
 a
 sense
 that
 the


revolution
 in
 clean
 energy
 is
 not
 going


to
 just
 totally
 displace
 oil
 in
 the


future.
 So
 for
 a
 moment,
 if
 we
 set
 aside


whether
 all
 three
 or
 any
 of
 those


conditions
 are
 actually
 anything
 that


these
 companies
 can
 bet
 on
 and
 just


assume
 for
 a
 moment
 that
 things
 work
 out


in
 their
 favor
 and
 that
 the
 investment


flows
 in,
 play
 out
 that
 best
 case


scenario
 for
 a
 minute.
 If
 Venezuela
 and


these
 oil
 companies
 achieve
 that,
 what


exactly
 would
 the
 US
 gain?


>> The
 US
 would
 gain
 a
 massive
 source
 of


oil
 and
 that
 means
 that
 global
 oil


prices
 will
 fall.
 And
 that
 means
 that


the
 gasoline
 prices
 will
 fall.
 The
 price


that
 American
 people
 pay
 at
 the
 pump


will
 fall.
 Remember
 that
 affordability


is
 now
 the
 crucial
 tenant
 of
 American


politics.
 This
 is
 a
 weight
 dragging
 down


Republican
 party
 in
 one
 election
 after


another.
 And
 President
 Trump's
 biggest


concern
 right
 now
 is
 bringing
 these


prices
 down
 and
 flooding
 the
 global
 oil


market
 with
 Venezuelan
 crude
 is


potentially
 one
 of
 the
 measures
 that


could
 help
 him
 achieve
 that
 goal.


>> And
 [snorts]
 if
 we're
 just
 still
 living


in
 this
 hypothetical
 best
 case,
 I
 have


to
 also
 imagine
 that
 controlling
 what's


assumed
 to
 be
 the
 world's
 largest
 oil


reserves
 would
 give
 the
 US
 a
 lot
 of


power
 geopolitically
 over
 our
 rivals.
 I


mean,
 in
 that
 case,
 you
 really
 can
 turn


a
 spigot
 on
 and
 off.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 this
 would
 have
 massive


consequences.
 Take,
 for example,


America's
 relations
 with
 Russia,
 another


nuclear
 power
 before.
 It's
 currently


negotiating
 a
 broad
 deal
 focused
 on
 the


war
 in
 Ukraine.
 Russia
 also
 deres
 most


of
 its
 revenues
 from
 oil.
 And
 if
 Trump


is
 able
 to
 set
 global
 oil
 prices
 by


turning
 on
 and
 off
 the
 spigot
 of


Venezuela's
 oil
 bounty,
 this
 is
 going
 to


make
 it
 very
 difficult
 for
 Russia
 to


achieve
 its
 goals
 without
 bowing
 to


America's
 needs.
 China,
 as
 we
 said,
 is


winning
 itself
 away
 from
 oil.
 But
 that


process
 could
 take
 decades
 and
 in
 the


meantime,
 it
 is
 extremely
 reliant
 on


imports
 from
 other
 countries.
 And
 if


Trump
 can
 control
 the
 source
 of
 those


impacts
 again,
 he
 can
 force
 Beijing
 to


bow
 to
 his
 demands.


>> I
 want
 to
 just
 push
 also
 on
 one
 of
 the


premises
 of
 these
 conversations,
 which


is
 that
 Trump
 and
 a
 future
 US
 leader


would
 actually
 be
 able
 to
 control


Venezuela's
 oil.
 The
 US
 does
 not
 have
 at


this
 point
 direct
 control
 over
 the


Venezuelan
 government.
 And
 I
 assume,
 you


know,
 down
 the
 line,
 future
 Venezuelan


leaders
 may
 be
 reluctant,
 honestly,
 to


be
 viewed
 as
 simply
 puppets
 of
 the
 US


government.
 And
 if
 the
 US
 military
 is


not,
 you
 know,
 training
 those
 weapons
 on


Venezuela
 indefinitely,


how
 long
 can
 that
 setup
 really
 last?
 Is


the
 premise
 of
 control
 actually
 a


fallacy?


>> For
 now,
 Natalie,
 things
 seems
 to
 be


working
 out
 in
 Trump's
 favor.
 Venezuelan


interim
 government
 has
 already
 announced


that
 it's
 going
 to
 embark
 on
 a
 massive


legal
 reform,
 potentially
 changing
 the


oil
 laws
 to
 give
 foreign
 companies
 a


greater
 say
 in
 how
 it's
 run.
 And


remember
 that
 this
 government
 remains


deeply
 dependent
 on
 the
 implicit
 threats


of
 American
 force
 to
 keep
 its
 internal


adversaries
 at
 bay
 and
 appears
 to
 be


more
 than
 willing
 to
 be
 doing
 Trump's


bidding.


But
 Natalie,
 history
 shows
 that
 such


ambitious,
 grandio,
 long-term
 plans


rarely
 turn
 out
 the
 way
 they've
 been


envisioned.
 There's
 just
 so
 many


different
 factors
 being
 thrown
 together


at
 this
 historical
 moment.
 And
 the


future
 of
 Venezuelan
 oil
 industry,
 and


by
 extension,
 the
 future
 Venezuelan


people
 may
 look
 very
 different
 from
 the


way
 Washington
 sees
 it
 now.

Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


On
 Monday,
 officials
 in
 Minnesota
 and


Illinois
 sued
 the
 Trump
 administration


over
 ICE
 enforcement
 in
 their
 states.


They
 argued
 that
 the
 mass
 deployment
 of


immigration
 agents
 violated
 the


Constitution
 and
 [music]
 infringed
 on


state
 sovereignty.


The
 suits
 come
 after
 a
 high-profile


[music]
 ICE
 campaign
 in
 Chicago.
 And
 in


the
 middle
 of
 an
 ongoing
 and


increasingly
 tense
 enforcement
 blitz
 in


Minneapolis,


[music]
 federal
 officials
 have
 defended


their
 work
 in
 both
 states,
 saying
 it's


been
 necessary
 [music]
 given
 that
 local


officials
 haven't
 cooperated
 with


President
 Trump's
 immigration
 crackdown.


And
 federal
 investigators
 examining
 the


fatal
 shooting
 of
 Renee
 [music]
 Good
 are


looking
 into
 her
 possible
 connections
 to


activist
 groups
 that
 have
 been


protesting
 ICE.
 [music]


According
 to
 people
 familiar
 with
 the


matter
 who
 spoke
 with
 the
 Times,
 they're


also
 reviewing
 [music]
 the
 actions
 of


the
 federal
 agent
 who
 killed
 her.
