>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 Odd
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway
 [music]


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Weisenthal.


>> So
 Joe,
 Trump
 nominated
 Kevin
 Worsh
 to


be
 Fed
 Chair
 last
 week.
 We've
 been


talking
 about
 it
 on
 the
 show.
 Obviously,


this
 has
 big
 market
 implications,
 but


I'm
 starting
 to
 think
 that
 the


sociological


questions
 and
 aspects
 of
 this
 are
 kind


of
 more
 interesting.


>> I'm
 so
 intrigued
 by
 the
 constellation
 of


people
 who
 have
 come
 out
 either
 in


support
 or
 opposition
 of
 this
 name.
 It


is
 not
 like
 any
 other
 nominee
 that
 I
 can


recall
 where
 you
 have
 fairly
 sort
 of


mainstream
 even
 sort
 of
 liberal
 names


like
 Jason
 Ferman
 or
 Gita
 Goponath
 uh


saying
 there's
 a
 great
 pick
 etc
 and
 then


you
 have
 Paul
 Krugman
 and
 Neil
 Da
 saying


this
 is
 a
 terrible
 pick
 and
 so
 forth.
 It


is
 it
 it
 cuts
 in
 ways
 that
 I
 would
 not


have
 necessarily
 anticipated
 not
 like


any
 other
 Trump
 pick
 that
 I
 recall.


>> Yeah,
 it
 is
 very
 split
 and
 it
 feels
 like


there's
 a
 split
 within
 Worsh's
 own


thinking
 as
 well.
 Right?
 Because
 here
 we


have
 a
 guy
 who
 has
 talked
 about
 wanting


to
 overhaul
 the
 Fed,
 right?
 And
 even


break
 some
 heads,
 I
 think
 was
 a
 direct


quote
 that
 we've
 mentioned
 before.
 He


has
 given
 a
 speech
 that
 is
 literally


titled
 an
 ode
 to
 independence
 at
 the


central
 bank.
 But


>> at
 the
 same
 time,
 there's
 a
 big
 question


mark
 about
 how
 and
 why
 he
 has
 suddenly


seemingly
 gone
 from
 an
 inflation
 hawk
 to


someone
 who's
 advocating
 for
 low
 rates.


>> Totally.
 And
 of
 course
 I
 think
 I
 mean


for
 you
 know
 just
 to
 be
 blunt
 this
 would


have
 been
 something
 that
 any
 nominee


from
 this
 administration
 to
 some
 extent


there
 would
 have
 been
 question
 marks


around
 because
 you
 know
 obviously
 Trump


has
 been
 very
 critical
 of
 uh
 Jerome


Powell
 despite
 the
 fact
 that
 he


nominated
 him
 himself
 and
 it's
 clear


that
 he
 wants
 a
 low
 rates
 now
 kind
 of


guy
 in
 there.
 He
 said
 after
 the


nomination
 he's
 like
 you
 know
 he
 didn't


make
 many
 promises
 but
 he's
 going
 to
 I


think
 he's
 going to
 be
 a
 low
 rates
 guy.


And
 then
 he
 joked
 a
 couple
 of
 days
 later


that
 he
 was
 going
 to
 sue
 about
 to
 bring


that
 up
 and
 that
 was
 a
 you
 know
 he
 was


joking.
 He
 said
 he
 was
 going
 to
 sue
 if


war


>> joke


is
 yeah
 joke
 air
 quotes
 you
 don't
 know


it
 but
 this
 has
 been
 the
 big
 thing
 and


so
 the
 question
 is
 the
 degree
 to
 which


an
 incoming
 Fed
 chair
 presume
 if
 he


passes
 the
 Senate
 which
 isn't
 guaranteed


but
 if
 he
 passes
 the
 Senate
 can


establish
 his
 commitment
 to
 what
 he's


long
 talked
 about
 which
 is
 Fed


independence
 while
 also
 you
 know
 not


immediately


angering
 the
 guy
 who
 nominated
 him


>> exactly


>> to
 the
 extent
 that
 that
 matters.
 Exactly


right.
 So,
 we
 need
 to
 talk
 about
 all
 of


this,
 get
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 color
 on,
 I


guess,
 Fedboard
 culture,


>> and
 political
 minations
 as
 well,
 and


market
 implications,
 of
 course.
 And
 we


really
 do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.
 We're


going
 to
 be
 speaking
 with
 Richard


Clarida.
 He
 is
 of
 course
 global
 economic


adviser
 at
 PIMCO,
 a
 professor
 of


economics
 at
 Colombia
 and
 most


importantly
 for
 the
 purpose
 of
 this


particular
 conversation,
 he's
 a
 former


vice
 chair
 of
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 Board.


So
 honestly
 the
 perfect
 guest.
 Rich,


thanks
 for
 coming
 back
 on
 the
 show.


>> Thank
 you.
 Looking
 forward
 to
 our


discussion.


>> So
 why
 don't
 I
 just
 start
 with
 the
 very


obvious
 question
 and
 we
 can
 dig
 in
 from


there.
 But
 last
 week
 when
 the
 news
 broke


about
 Worsh
 being
 selected
 by
 Trump,


what
 was
 the
 first
 thought
 that
 went


through
 your
 head?


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 sensible
 choice.
 It


it
 makes
 sense
 along
 important


dimensions.
 In
 particular,
 it's


important
 because
 I
 think
 based
 upon


background
 and
 and
 what
 he's
 been


writing
 recently
 that
 wars
 will
 work


very
 well
 with
 Scott
 Bessant
 at
 at
 the


Treasury.
 there
 is
 Fed
 independence
 that


we'll
 get
 into,
 but
 it's
 important
 as
 a


practical
 matter
 that
 the
 Fed
 work
 well


with
 the
 the
 Treasury
 and
 so
 it
 makes


sense
 along
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 uh
 dimensions.


Actually,
 let's
 just
 get
 into
 that


because
 I
 do
 find
 that
 to
 be
 very


interesting.
 Say
 more
 about
 working
 with


the
 Treasury.
 You
 know,
 some
 people


would
 say
 that
 is
 not
 the
 Fed's
 job.
 In


fact,
 I
 would
 say,
 you
 know,
 Kevin
 Worsh


going
 back
 to
 the
 immediate
 post
 great


financial
 crisis
 era
 had
 talked
 about


how,
 for
 example,
 it's
 not
 the
 Fed's
 job


to
 backs
 stop
 fiscal
 policy.
 It's
 not


the
 Fed's
 job
 to
 enable
 larger
 deficits,


which
 he,
 I
 believe,
 saw
 QE
 as
 enabling.


But
 from
 your
 perspective,
 talk
 to
 us


about
 what
 a
 positive
 relationship


between
 uh
 the
 Fed
 chair
 and
 the


Treasury
 Secretary
 looks
 like.


>> Yeah,
 it
 thank
 you
 for
 letting
 me
 add


some
 color.
 to
 that
 because
 there
 there


dimensions
 and
 domains
 where
 it
 would


actually
 be
 a
 very
 bad
 idea
 for
 the
 the


Fed
 to
 be
 dominated
 by
 the
 Treasury.
 But


along
 several
 dimensions,
 a


collaborative
 working
 relationship
 is


important
 and
 I'll
 name
 name
 several.


First
 is
 the
 Fed
 going
 back
 to
 its


founding
 is
 the
 fiscal
 agent
 of
 the
 the


government.
 it
 has
 a
 responsibility
 to


make
 sure
 that
 the
 treasury
 market
 has


adequate
 liquidity
 that
 it
 functions


properly.
 Um,
 and
 so
 that
 that's
 an


important
 element
 of
 of
 the
 job
 and


always
 has
 been.
 It's
 also
 important


because
 the
 Fed
 uh
 has
 an
 important
 role


in
 bank
 regulation
 but
 not
 a
 not
 a


monopoly
 role.
 The
 the
 controller
 of
 the


currency
 which
 is
 within
 Treasury
 also


has
 a
 a
 regulation
 responsibility
 as


FDIC.
 So
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 necessity
 on


bank
 regulation
 there
 there
 needs
 to
 be


a
 degree
 of
 of of
 coordination
 and
 and


so
 I
 would
 really
 highlight
 those
 two


areas.


>> So
 I
 mentioned
 at
 the
 beginning
 that
 I'm


kind
 of
 interested
 in
 the
 inner


functioning
 of
 the
 Fed
 board.
 From
 your


perspective,


how
 does
 communication
 between
 the
 Fed


and
 the
 Treasury
 actually
 happen?
 I'm


sort
 of
 envisioning
 like
 I
 don't
 know
 a


WhatsApp
 or
 signal
 group
 chat


>> there.
 There
 is
 a
 tradition,
 it's
 not
 in


statute,
 there
 is
 a
 tradition
 that
 the


Treasury
 Secretary
 and
 the
 Fed
 chair


meet
 on
 a
 regular
 basis,
 oftentimes
 over


uh
 breakfast.
 And
 so
 during
 my
 time,


that
 was
 the
 primary
 uh
 point
 of
 contact


was
 bilateral
 between
 when
 I
 was
 there


Jay
 Pal
 and
 Steven
 Minutuchin
 and
 then


when
 Janet
 Yellen
 became
 Treasury


Secretary.
 So
 that's
 informal.
 There
 are


typically
 not
 staff
 uh
 in
 the
 room
 uh


for
 that.
 There's
 also
 the
 financial


stability
 oversight
 council
 which
 was
 a


creation
 in
 DoddFrank
 which
 by
 statute


is
 chaired
 by
 the
 treasury
 secretary
 and


then
 the
 there
 fed
 among
 other
 uh


agencies
 also
 participates
 in
 that


process.
 And
 then
 thirdly
 as
 I
 mentioned


anything
 involving
 a
 bank
 regulation
 is


typically
 going
 to
 involve
 if
 the
 senior


or
 even
 the
 vice
 chair
 for
 supervision


level
 interaction
 on
 bank
 regulation.


You
 know,
 let's
 get
 into
 some
 of
 the,
 I


guess,
 criticisms
 or
 perhaps
 questions


about
 Kevin
 Worsh.
 And
 there's
 a
 few


different
 dimensions.
 One
 is,
 of
 course,


there's
 perception
 that
 he's
 long
 been


an
 inflation
 hawk
 and
 suddenly
 he's


sounded
 more
 dovish
 over
 the
 last,
 you


know,
 12,
 18
 months
 or
 whatever.
 Setting


that
 aside
 though,
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 the


criticisms
 start
 early
 on,
 including
 his


judgment
 around
 the
 great
 financial


crisis.
 Concerned
 more
 about
 inflation,


you
 know,
 even
 up
 into
 fall
 2008
 than


employment
 right
 on
 the
 eve
 of
 collapse.


Also
 seemed
 to
 get
 very
 anxious
 about


inflation
 soon
 coming
 out
 of
 the
 worst


of
 it,
 etc.
 But
 like
 when
 you
 think


about
 okay
 like
 his
 qualifications
 and


what
 we
 can
 expect
 from
 him,
 how
 much


like
 when
 you
 go
 back
 to
 that
 era,
 how


much
 should
 we
 hold
 that
 against
 him


perhaps?
 Either
 that
 he
 was
 off
 the
 mark


or
 that
 he
 was
 at least
 very
 far
 out
 of


consensus
 at
 the
 time.
 Well,
 I
 think
 you


have
 to
 look
 at
 the
 entire
 picture
 and


and
 Kevin
 was
 also
 very
 involved
 with


Ben
 and
 and
 and
 and
 Tim
 Gner
 and
 and


Dudley
 and
 the
 crisis
 response
 to
 the


global
 financial
 crisis
 which
 really


played
 out
 over
 a
 period
 of
 12
 to
 18


months
 and
 I
 think
 by
 most
 accounts
 in


my
 judgment
 that
 was
 a
 you
 he
 actually


added
 a
 lot
 of
 value
 in
 in
 the
 fog
 of


war.
 inflation
 as
 I
 myself
 learned


especially
 in
 periods
 of
 crisis
 and


unusual
 large
 shocks
 inflation


forecasting
 can
 be
 can
 be
 challenging.


So
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 would
 hold
 that


particular
 episode
 against
 him.
 I
 think


it
 does
 fairly
 characterize
 the
 way
 that


most
 of
 us
 think
 about
 Kevin
 throughout


during
 that
 period
 and
 really
 the
 last


15
 years
 is
 he
 has
 been
 a
 pretty


consistent
 critic
 of
 the
 Fed
 under
 the


second
 half
 of
 Bernani
 and
 then
 Yellen


and
 Pal
 and
 typically
 the
 criticism
 has


come
 from
 the
 hawkish
 direction
 and


certainly
 in
 that
 episode
 his
 his


criticism
 of
 the
 Fed
 was
 that
 in
 some


certain
 quotes
 would
 indicate
 that


hawkish
 inclination
 as
 Well,
 maybe
 just


I
 can
 follow
 up
 because
 in
 your
 earlier


comment,
 you
 also
 mentioned
 his
 his


recent
 advocacy
 for
 for
 lower
 rates.


Now,
 it's
 important
 this
 is
 in
 the


context
 of
 a
 committee
 that
 under
 Pal's


leadership
 beginning
 in
 September
 of


2024
 already
 began
 to
 cut
 rates.
 In


fact,
 when
 I
 did
 your
 show
 earlier
 and


we
 were
 talking
 about
 that
 right
 after
 I


think
 the
 initial
 rate
 cuts
 under
 under


PAL,
 I
 made
 reference
 to
 what
 I've
 been


calling
 for
 some
 time
 now
 the
 Fed
 is
 is


running
 what
 I
 call
 the
 quote
 2
 point


something
 inflation
 target
 which
 was


they
 don't
 like
 it
 to
 start
 with
 a


three,
 four,
 five,
 six
 or
 seven.
 But
 if


inflation
 gets
 down
 to
 2
 point


something,
 they
 can
 start
 to
 talk
 and


think
 about
 rate
 cuts
 as
 they
 did
 under


under
 PAL
 and
 in
 importantly
 at
 the


December
 Fed
 meeting.
 So
 just
 about
 six


weeks
 ago,
 the
 Fed
 indicated
 through


those
 very
 imperfect
 dot
 plots
 that
 a


majority
 of
 the
 committee
 of
 of
 that


existing
 committee
 which
 Kevin
 will


inherit
 felt
 that
 at
 least
 one
 more
 rate


cut
 this
 year
 given
 the
 circumstances


would
 be
 appropriate.
 So
 yes,
 Kevin
 has


come
 out
 in
 favor
 of
 rate
 cuts
 in
 his


public
 comments.
 don't
 know
 what
 he
 said


privately
 to
 the
 president,
 but
 I
 doubt


that
 they
 differed
 what
 he
 said


publicly.
 But
 that's
 in
 the
 context
 of
 a


committee
 that
 at least
 a
 majority
 of


whom
 think
 that
 in
 this
 year
 it'll
 be


appropriate
 to
 cut
 at
 least
 once.


[music]


[music]


I'm
 just
 going
 to
 keep
 pretending
 to
 be


an
 anthropologist
 and
 ask
 a
 bunch
 of


cultural
 questions,
 but
 what
 actually
 is


the
 role
 of
 Fed
 chair
 when
 you're
 in
 a


monetary
 policy
 meeting?
 So,
 you
 know,


let's
 say
 that
 Worish
 has
 some
 sort
 of


outlier
 opinion.
 I
 I
 don't
 know,
 he's


prioritizing
 employment
 versus
 prices
 or


whatever.


>> Yeah.
 Can
 he
 convince
 everyone
 at
 the


table,
 all
 the
 voting
 members
 to


actually
 change
 their
 minds?


>> Tracy,
 it's
 a
 great
 question
 because
 a


point
 that
 I
 like
 to
 make,
 at least
 in


my
 professional
 time,
 which
 goes
 back
 to


Paul
 Vulkar,
 we
 tend
 to
 talk
 about
 the


Fed
 is
 the
 Vulkar
 Fed,
 the
 Greenspan


Fed,
 Pal
 Yellen,
 Bernani
 Fed.
 and
 and


that's
 appropriate
 because
 in
 this
 era,


Fed
 shares
 have
 been
 persuasive
 and
 they


and
 they've
 usually
 got
 their
 their


their
 way.
 But
 importantly,
 the
 Fed
 as


an
 institution
 was
 specifically
 designed


by
 the
 Congress
 in
 the
 1930s


in
 such
 a
 way
 that
 any
 material
 monetary


policy
 decision,
 do
 they
 raise
 or
 lower


interest
 rates
 or
 do
 they
 buy
 or
 sell


treasuries,
 requires
 an
 affirmative
 vote


of
 a
 committee
 comprised
 of
 12
 members.


And
 so
 as
 I
 as
 I've
 liked
 to
 say
 and


I'll
 say
 it
 again,
 really
 the
 power
 of


the
 Fed
 chair
 is
 the
 power
 of
 persuasion


because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 he
 or
 she


only
 has
 one
 vote.
 Now
 it's
 often
 argued


that
 well
 Rich
 that's
 silly
 because


rarely
 do
 Fed
 chairs
 get
 outvoted
 and


that
 that's
 true.
 It
 happened
 once
 or


twice
 under
 Vulkar.
 It
 it
 happened
 way


back
 in
 the
 1940s.
 And
 so
 yes,


empirically
 it
 may
 appear
 as
 though


chairs
 always
 get
 their
 way,
 but
 but


remember
 Fed
 chairs
 know
 where
 the


committee
 is
 leaning
 and
 often
 times
 or


certain
 circumstances
 they
 may


themselves
 decide
 not
 to
 be
 on
 the


losing
 end
 of
 a
 particular
 vote
 but
 to


try
 to
 persuade
 the
 committee
 over
 time


to
 move
 in
 their
 direction.
 Now
 one


thing
 I
 can't
 really
 speak
 to
 the


Greenspan
 Fed
 but
 beginning
 under


Bernani
 and
 continuing
 under
 Yelen
 and


certainly
 with
 Jay
 Pal
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


premeating
 FOMC
 meeting
 communication


and
 indeed
 Pal
 during
 my
 time
 there


would
 have
 individual
 bilateral


discussions
 with
 the
 other
 18
 people
 not


just
 the
 voters
 but
 if
 you
 know
 there


are
 12
 voters
 and
 another
 seven
 Reserve


Bank
 presidents
 who
 don't
 vote
 in
 a


particular
 year
 so
 Pal
 would
 have
 18


individual
 phone
 calls
 or
 face-toface


meetings
 before
 every
 uh
 meeting.
 I


don't
 think
 that
 was
 the
 practice
 under


Greenspan,
 for
 example.
 Um,
 and
 so
 part


of
 really
 what
 a
 Fed
 chair
 does
 is
 to


get
 a
 sense
 of
 where
 individuals
 on
 the


committee
 are,
 but
 really
 an
 important


power
 that
 the
 chair
 does
 have
 is
 the


chair
 sets
 the
 agenda
 for
 the
 meeting


and
 the
 staff
 briefings
 for
 the
 most


part
 are
 prepared
 by
 the
 board
 uh
 staff,


sometimes
 with
 input
 from
 the
 reserve


bank
 presidents
 and
 the
 board
 staff


reports
 to
 the
 chair.
 And
 so
 the
 agenda


for
 the
 meeting
 and
 often
 times
 details


about
 the
 sort
 of
 analysis
 that
 would
 be


useful
 for
 the
 discussion
 will
 be


something
 that
 the
 chair
 will
 have
 a


view
 on.
 Now
 now
 during
 you
 you
 asked


for
 anecdotes
 you
 know
 during
 during
 my


time
 because
 of
 my
 background
 in
 in


monetary
 economics
 chair
 pal
 J
 pal
 did


ask
 me
 to
 take
 a
 pretty
 hands-on
 role
 in


interfacing
 between
 himself
 and
 the


staff
 in
 particular
 the
 forecasting
 and


the
 monetary
 affairs
 groups
 but


ultimately
 my
 role
 was
 really
 you
 know


in
 service
 to
 what
 he
 wanted
 to
 do
 to


produce
 a
 successful
 meeting.
 The
 final


thing
 I'll
 say,
 you
 got
 you
 got
 me
 sort


of
 wound
 up.


>> It's
 all
 great.


>> The
 final
 thing
 I'll
 say
 is,
 and
 I
 think


this
 has
 been
 publicly
 uh
 reported,
 but


it's
 it
 the
 at
 a
 typical
 Fed
 meeting,


there
 is
 a
 policy
 announcement
 that


comes
 out
 at
 2
 p.m.
 That's
 a
 decision,


and
 the
 committee,
 of
 course,
 is


discussing
 that
 decision,
 but
 it's


discussing
 other
 options.
 And
 at
 a


typical
 meeting,
 in
 addition
 to
 the
 the


Fed's
 statement
 and
 the
 policy
 action


that
 was
 the
 outcome
 of
 the
 meeting,
 the


committee
 is
 also
 discussing


alternatives,
 actually
 tangible


alternatives,
 alternative
 A,
 alternative


B,
 alternative
 C.
 And
 there
 can
 be
 quite


extensive
 back
 and
 forth
 in
 the
 meetings


about
 those
 alternatives.
 And
 so
 even
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 what
 the
 public
 sees


is
 the
 Fed
 decided
 to
 keep
 rates
 on
 hold


and
 there
 were
 two
 dissents
 which
 were


governors
 and
 uh
 Waller
 a
 lot
 more
 was


being
 discussed
 at
 the
 meeting
 as


potential
 alternatives
 to
 that
 statement


and
 that
 decision
 and
 a
 lot
 of


discussion
 in
 meetings
 can
 be
 about
 what


the
 committee
 thinks
 might
 be


appropriate
 for
 the
 next
 meeting
 or
 the


meeting
 down
 the
 road.
 Indeed,
 one
 of


the
 the
 many
 things
 I
 learned
 I
 made
 a


promise
 to
 myself
 when
 I
 was
 in
 the
 job


to
 to
 try
 to
 learn
 something
 new
 every


day
 and
 and
 and
 I
 usually
 did
 and
 and


one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 didn't
 appreciate


before
 I
 got
 into
 the
 to
 the
 Fed
 is


especially
 the
 the
 chair
 and
 and
 the


palett
 you
 you
 really
 need
 to
 have
 a


sense
 of
 the
 arc
 of
 both
 the
 year
 in


terms
 of
 the
 data
 flow
 you're
 likely
 to


get
 and
 the
 arc
 of
 where
 decisions
 need


to
 be
 made
 and
 how
 they're
 they're
 made.


And
 and
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 sort
 of
 like
 an


imperfect
 but
 not
 completely
 a
 bad


analogy
 is
 we've
 heard
 of
 legendary


football
 coaches
 who
 like
 script
 the


first
 50
 plays
 of
 the
 game.
 Now


sometimes
 they
 move
 away
 but
 they
 want


to
 have
 a
 plan
 about
 how
 they'll
 react


if
 the
 defense
 does
 a
 certain
 thing
 or


the
 other.
 And
 it's
 not
 dissimilar
 to


the
 way
 at least
 when
 I
 was
 at
 the
 pal


Fed
 that
 that
 we
 would
 be
 thinking
 not


only
 about
 the
 January
 meeting
 and
 then


start
 thinking
 about
 March
 but
 really


the
 arc
 of
 the
 of
 of
 the
 year
 you
 know


based
 upon
 your
 view
 of
 the
 data
 and
 and


a
 number
 of
 other
 considerations.
 So
 th


those
 are
 some
 tangible
 examples
 of
 the


way
 chairs
 I
 think
 put
 their
 imprint
 on


the
 on
 the
 process.
 So,
 thinking
 of


calling
 several
 plays
 in
 a
 row,
 we've


seen
 uh
 Kevin
 Wars
 very
 skeptical
 of


forward
 guidance
 and
 some
 of
 the


monetary
 policy
 innovations
 that


occurred
 in
 2008,
 2009,
 and
 so
 forth.
 I


think
 it's
 easy
 maybe
 for
 people
 to


forget
 that
 things
 like
 the
 dots,
 the


press
 conference,
 and
 so
 forth,
 these


are
 all
 very
 modern.
 For
 most
 of
 the


Fed's
 history,
 there
 was
 none
 of
 this


stuff.
 Do
 you
 think


>> I
 remember
 the
 invention
 of
 the
 dot


plot?
 Remember
 that?
 We
 were
 trying
 I


still
 don't
 get
 it
 but
 yeah.


>> Well,
 we
 were
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


internally
 at
 Bloomberg
 like
 the
 best


way
 to
 translate
 that
 information.
 Do


you
 think
 I
 mean
 setting
 aside
 Worsh's


view,
 do
 you
 think
 there's
 an
 argument


to
 be
 made
 that
 some
 of
 these


communication
 innovations
 that
 maybe


made
 a
 lot
 of
 sense
 during
 a
 period
 of


ZER
 where
 the
 Fed
 was
 trying
 to
 convince


the
 market
 that
 it
 would
 be
 on
 hold
 for


a
 very
 long
 time
 that
 maybe
 they
 can
 be


revisited
 and
 we
 don't
 need
 so
 much
 of


this
 stuff
 in
 normal
 times.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 let's
 focus
 now
 on


communication
 since
 that
 was
 your


specific
 question
 but
 perhaps
 later
 also


talk
 about
 Kevin's
 other
 critiques
 which


are
 broadly
 the
 balance
 sheet
 sort
 of


mission
 creep
 in
 the
 size
 and
 the


composition
 of
 the
 balance
 sheet


>> and
 then
 third
 critique
 is
 is
 grounding


Fed
 policy
 both
 actions
 and


communication


>> more
 towards
 a
 policy
 rules
 framework


and
 a
 less
 moving
 away
 from
 what
 he


calls
 meeting
 by
 meeting
 discretion.


Let's
 talk
 about
 communication
 and
 and


having
 observed
 and
 and
 taught
 this
 and


and
 actually
 done
 it
 for
 four
 years.
 I


want
 to
 begin
 with
 a
 historically


factual
 statement
 that's
 important
 to


provide
 some
 context.
 It
 is
 perfectly


possible
 to
 conduct
 a
 very
 successful


monetary
 policy
 without
 any
 forward


guidance.


>> Paul
 Vulkar
 did
 it
 for
 eight
 years
 and


Alan
 Greenspan
 did
 it
 for
 17.
 You
 know,


there
 would
 be
 little
 hints
 and
 winks


and
 nods,
 but
 forward
 guidance
 as
 we


know
 it
 today
 is
 really
 something
 that


was
 not
 really
 in
 the
 toolkit
 of
 of
 Paul


Vulkar
 or
 for
 the
 first
 17
 years,
 Alan


Greenspan.
 Now,
 Greenspan's
 endlessly


fascinating.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 fascinating


things
 about
 Greenspan
 is
 that
 in
 his


last
 two
 years,
 and
 I
 would
 say
 not


coincidentally
 at
 the
 time
 that
 Ben


Bernani
 was
 a
 a
 Fed
 governor,
 right
 at


the
 very
 end
 in
 2004
 to
 six,
 Greenspan


began
 to
 dip
 his
 his
 toe
 into
 forward


guidance.
 But
 for
 the
 most
 part,
 that


was
 not
 really
 uh
 part
 of
 of
 the


toolkit.
 So
 why
 did
 forward
 guide
 first


of
 all
 then
 what
 is
 forward
 guidance
 and


why
 it
 become
 part
 of
 the
 toolkit?
 Well,


at
 its
 most
 basic
 level,
 forward


guidance
 is
 providing
 information
 to


observers
 and
 importantly
 to
 financial


markets
 about
 the
 committee's


expectation
 of
 the
 path
 for
 interest


rates.
 Now,
 there's
 a
 huge
 academic


literature.
 I've
 contributed
 to
 it


myself.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 interesting


things
 that
 you
 might
 find
 that's
 might


be
 surprising
 about
 that
 literature
 is


it
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 20
 years
 ago


arguing
 that
 forward
 guidance
 was


irrelevant
 because
 the
 Fed's
 looking
 at


inflation
 data.
 The
 market's
 looking
 at


inflation
 data.
 If
 inflation's
 too
 damn


high,
 the
 Fed
 will
 raise
 rates.
 If
 it's


low,
 they'll
 cut
 [laughter]
 rates.
 So


you
 don't
 really
 get
 any
 you
 don't


really
 get
 any
 incremental
 benefit
 by


telling
 people
 what
 you're
 going
 to
 do


if
 they
 know
 you're
 going to
 do
 it


anyway.
 And
 so
 the
 the
 case
 for
 forward


guidance
 then
 has
 to
 then
 rest
 on


something
 other
 than
 it's
 okay
 to
 talk


about
 what
 you're
 going
 to
 do.
 And
 and


where
 forward
 guidance
 really
 became
 a


focus
 of
 the
 Fed
 was
 out
 of
 desperation


at
 the
 zero
 bath.
 So
 rates
 got
 cut
 to


zero
 after
 Lehman
 Brothers.
 The
 economy


was
 in
 freef
 fall.
 The
 financial
 system


was
 on
 the
 verge
 of
 collapse


>> and
 the
 Bernani
 Fed
 could
 not
 use


conventional
 policy
 to
 lower
 rates


because
 they
 had
 hit,
 you
 know,
 a
 zero


bound.
 And
 so
 they
 began
 to
 provide


guidance
 to
 the
 markets
 to
 essentially


reassure
 markets
 that
 they
 were
 not
 on
 a


hair
 trigger
 to
 hike
 rates
 because
 they


kept
 noticing
 that
 even
 though
 the


economy
 was
 weak,
 inflation
 was
 low,


unemployment
 was
 high,
 the
 bond
 market


kept
 pricing
 in
 rate
 hikes
 that
 they
 had


no
 intention
 of
 delivering.
 And
 so


forward
 guidance
 really
 took
 on
 an


important
 role
 when
 the
 Fed
 was
 trapped


at
 at
 at
 the
 zero
 bound.
 Now
 an


interesting
 correlary
 then
 is
 what
 do


you
 do
 when
 you
 raise
 rates
 above
 zero


and
 of
 course
 the
 pal
 Fed
 did
 that


beginning
 well
 yellen
 and
 then
 pal
 did


that
 and
 I
 was
 actually
 there
 for
 the


rate
 hikes
 in
 that
 in
 that
 cycle
 and
 the


fed
 by
 the
 time
 I
 had
 arrived


importantly
 because
 of
 the
 dots
 the
 Fed


had
 begun
 to
 had
 continued
 to
 use


forward
 guidance
 even
 after
 rates
 got


above
 zero
 and
 oftentimes
 the
 dot
 plot


was
 an
 input
 uh
 into
 that
 since
 it


provides
 imperfect
 but
 potentially


useful
 information
 about
 the
 committee's


intention
 to
 adjust
 rates.
 Let
 let
 me


say,
 however,
 that
 I
 think
 it's
 entirely


appropriate
 that
 Kevin
 Worsh
 or
 anyone


who
 becomes
 a
 Fed
 chair
 now
 think
 about


the
 cost
 and
 benefits
 of
 forward


guidance.
 Indeed,
 I've
 said
 for
 at
 least


a
 decade,
 including
 before
 when
 I
 joined


the
 Fed,
 that
 forward
 guidance
 and


quantitative
 easing
 are
 not
 exempt
 from


the
 laws
 of
 economics.
 they
 they
 have


benefits
 but
 also
 costs.
 There
 are


probably
 diminishing
 returns.
 And
 so
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 at
 all
 inappropriate


for
 the
 Fed
 under
 the
 leadership
 of
 the


chair
 to
 think
 about
 benefits
 and
 cost


of
 forward
 guidance
 in
 circumstances


when
 it
 may
 be
 useful
 and
 circumstances


when
 it
 may
 not
 be.
 Let
 me
 just
 add
 a


little
 kota
 here.
 Another
 dimension
 of


Fed
 communication
 that's
 changed
 is


really
 been
 the
 result
 of
 a
 change
 in


technology
 and
 access.
 So,
 you
 know,
 if


you
 go
 back
 to
 the
 1980s,
 yes,
 when


Vulkar
 gave
 a
 speech,
 people
 would
 read


it
 and
 the
 Times
 and
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


would
 report
 on
 it,
 but
 other
 than
 that,


Fed
 communication
 was
 was
 pretty
 uh


limited.
 Uh
 and
 of
 course
 now
 of
 course


we
 all
 have
 access
 to
 the
 internet
 and


financial
 news
 and
 each
 Fed
 president


and
 and
 Fed
 governor
 uh
 give
 uh
 speeches


and
 so
 there's
 a
 lot
 more
 individual


discussion
 of
 what
 individuals
 on
 the


committee
 think
 would
 be
 appropriate


policy
 as
 well
 as
 formal
 guidance
 as


well.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 that's
 sort
 of


where
 we
 are
 on
 on
 forward
 guidance
 as


of
 today.


>> Just
 one
 followup
 to
 that.
 The
 way
 I


think
 about
 it
 from
 a
 market
 perspective


is
 that
 forward
 guidance
 you
 know
 since


2008
 2009
 has
 had
 the
 effect
 of


dampening
 volatility
 especially
 in
 the


bond
 market
 and
 now
 if
 you
 have
 less


forward
 guidance
 it
 would
 seem
 perhaps


there's
 a
 risk
 that
 volatility
 makes
 a


return.
 Putting
 on
 your
 your
 PIMCO
 hat


from
 the
 perspective
 of
 the
 bond
 market


what
 would
 less
 forward
 guidance


actually
 mean?
 I
 think
 you
 hit
 the
 nail


on
 the
 head.
 I
 think
 the
 most
 robust


prediction
 I
 would
 make
 is
 it
 would
 it


would
 in
 increase
 to
 some
 extent
 market


volatility
 in
 particular
 interest
 rate


volatility
 and
 importantly
 and
 I'll
 just


be
 very
 direct
 and
 and
 and
 and
 blunt
 in


the
 decade
 remember
 rates
 were
 at
 zero


for
 seven
 years
 after
 the
 global


financial
 crisis.
 Uh
 Janet
 Yellen
 did


not
 hike
 rates
 until
 December
 of
 2015.


Uh
 and
 they've
 been
 on
 hold
 for
 seven


years.
 And
 so
 not
 only
 was
 realized
 rate


volatility
 low
 at
 the
 front
 end
 of
 the


curve,
 but
 the
 Fed
 was
 using
 a
 lot
 of


forward
 guidance
 and
 a
 lot
 of


quantitative
 easing.
 And
 that
 was


suppressing
 interest
 rate
 volatility
 for


a
 very
 long
 period
 of
 time.
 And
 then


even
 once
 the
 Fed
 began
 to
 lift
 off


because
 it
 was
 deploying
 forward


guidance
 that
 also
 served
 at
 the
 margin


to
 suppress
 rate
 volatility.
 And
 you
 see


this
 for
 example
 the
 move
 index
 which
 is


a
 basically
 a
 bond
 market
 index.
 So


volatility
 got
 down
 to
 very
 low
 levels.


So,
 so
 part
 of
 what
 has
 been
 happening


really
 in
 the
 last
 several
 years
 under


the
 PAL
 Fed
 is
 bond
 market
 implied


volatility
 has
 gone
 up
 relative
 to
 the


suppressed
 levels
 of
 the
 decade
 before


the
 pandemic,
 but
 not
 really
 up
 to


levels
 that
 were
 at
 all
 unusual
 back
 in


the
 1990s.


And
 so
 I
 think
 my
 first
 order
 assessment


is
 we
 may
 be
 going
 back
 to
 what
 I
 would


call
 more
 normal
 or
 preGFC
 levels
 of


rate
 volatility.
 Now
 the
 Fed
 is
 not
 the


only
 only
 game
 in
 town
 when
 it
 comes
 to


rate
 volatility.
 There's
 reasons
 for


rate
 volatility
 to
 be
 elevated
 because


of
 uncertainty
 about
 fiscal
 policy
 for


example
 uh
 as
 uh
 as
 well.
 You
 know
 first


of
 all
 I
 want
 to
 say
 you
 know
 I
 remember


the
 concern
 that
 the
 Fed
 had
 in
 2009


about
 does
 the
 market
 see
 the
 Fed
 as
 a


hair
 trigger
 on
 inflation?
 I
 don't
 think


a
 lot
 of
 people
 remember
 this,
 but
 in


early
 2009,
 the
 market
 was
 pricing
 in


rate
 hikes
 by
 the
 end
 of
 2009,
 which


seems
 almost
 unbelievable
 in
 retrospect


when
 you
 remind
 us
 that
 the
 Fed
 went


seven
 years
 without
 a
 hike.
 So,
 there


really
 was
 a
 very
 intense
 challenge
 on


the
 Fed's
 hands
 to
 convince
 the
 market


that
 it
 was
 going
 to
 stay
 on
 hold
 for
 a


very
 long
 time.
 And
 I
 think
 forward


guidance
 clearly
 played
 a
 sort
 of


specific
 tech
 role
 there.
 Let's
 talk
 now


about
 balance
 sheet.
 Yeah,


>> Bill
 Dudley
 wrote
 a
 column
 for
 Bloomberg


Opinion
 uh
 after
 the
 Worsh
 nomination


and
 he
 was
 sort
 of
 critical.
 He
 said
 he


didn't
 think
 that
 Worsh
 was
 going
 to
 be


able
 to
 shrink
 the
 balance
 sheet
 much


further
 unless
 there
 were
 some
 other


changes
 perhaps
 relating
 to
 banks


capital
 requirements
 etc.
 Worsh's
 own


criticisms
 of
 the
 balance
 sheet
 seem
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 moving
 target
 at
 some


point.
 How
 well
 do
 you
 I
 mean
 maybe
 I


would
 ask
 how
 well
 does
 any
 economist


have
 a
 handle
 on
 the
 effects
 of
 balance


sheet
 policy
 but
 what's
 your
 read
 on


sort
 of
 the
 reality
 of
 wars
 coming


intersection
 perhaps
 with
 the
 balance


sheet


>> yeah
 so
 I
 think
 there
 are
 two
 related


but
 distinct
 elements
 to
 this
 first
 is


that
 Kevin
 has
 been
 publicly
 and


consistently
 critical
 of
 every
 expansion


in
 the
 Fed's
 balance
 sheet
 since
 the


first
 QE1
 program
 so
 he
 very
 famously


said
 he
 was
 opposed
 to
 the
 QE2
 program


in
 2010.
 Uh
 although
 I
 think
 he
 did
 vote


for
 it,
 but
 then
 he
 left
 soon
 uh
 after.


And
 so
 there's
 the
 issue
 of


backwardlooking,
 oh,
 the
 Fed
 should
 not


have
 been
 buying
 treasuries
 and


mortgages
 as
 it
 did.
 And
 I
 think
 there's


no
 reason
 to
 think
 he's
 changed
 his


mind.
 Indeed,
 Secretary
 Bessant
 wrote
 a


piece
 with
 a
 very
 provocative
 title,
 the


Fed's,
 you
 know,
 gain
 of
 function
 uh


monetary
 policy.
 and
 he
 was
 also


critical
 in
 retrospect
 of
 the
 expansion


in
 the
 Fed's
 balance
 sheet.
 The


important
 question
 of
 course
 for
 for


OddLot's
 listeners
 and
 for
 markets
 is


okay
 that's
 the
 past
 looking
 ahead
 and


one
 of
 the
 many
 interesting
 things
 that


Kevin
 Walsh
 said
 during
 his
 I
 guess


campaign
 to
 become
 Fed
 chair
 was
 to
 call


for
 a
 new
 accord
 between
 the
 Treasury


and
 the
 Fed
 with
 regards
 to
 the
 balance


sheet.
 Now
 he
 hasn't
 provided
 a
 lot
 of


details.
 What
 we
 do
 know
 is
 what
 the


first
 accord
 between
 the
 Fed
 and
 the


Treasury
 looked
 like,
 which
 was
 back
 in


1951.
 And
 what
 was
 interesting
 about


that,
 it
 was
 essentially
 the
 Fed's


declaration
 of
 independence
 to
 raise


rates
 without
 getting
 approval
 from
 the


Treasury,
 which
 is
 why
 Fed
 historians


think
 of
 it
 as
 really
 a
 signal
 event
 in


Fed
 history.
 So,
 I
 don't
 think
 that's


really
 an
 issue.
 Now,
 presumably
 what


Kevin
 means
 when
 he
 talks
 about
 an


accord
 is
 a
 mutual
 understanding
 between


the
 Fed
 and
 the
 Treasury
 about
 the
 size


and
 composition
 of
 its
 balance
 sheet.


And
 so,
 for
 example,
 you
 could
 agree


that
 the
 Fed
 needs
 to
 have
 the
 current


size
 balance
 sheet,
 but
 it
 should
 not


own
 mortgage
 back
 securities
 or
 30-year


Treasuries.
 It
 should
 own
 T
 bills.
 So,


that's
 a
 conversation
 you
 can
 have.
 You


can
 also
 also
 have
 a
 conversation
 about


the
 Fed
 having
 a
 a
 smaller
 balance


sheet.
 admire
 of
 Bill
 and
 I
 I
 read
 that


column
 and
 agreed
 with
 almost
 all
 of
 it.


The
 the
 point
 being
 is
 is
 to
 get
 from


here
 to
 there
 is
 is
 not
 straightforward


and
 in
 particular
 it
 involves
 the


banking
 system
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 level
 of


reserves
 in
 the
 banking
 uh
 system.
 The


Fed
 has
 been
 very
 reticent
 uh
 although


it's
 been
 tempted
 and
 it's
 discussed


selling
 mortgage
 back
 securities.
 You


can
 find
 it
 in
 the
 transcripts
 going


back
 a
 dozen
 years
 and
 two
 years.
 And
 so


right
 now
 there
 is
 no
 appetite
 in
 the


existing
 Fed
 to
 think
 about
 shrinking


the
 balance
 sheet
 through
 any
 sort
 of
 a


any
 sort
 of
 a
 sale.
 And
 then
 finally
 and


I
 and
 I
 do
 want
 to
 get
 this
 on
 the
 table


because
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 very
 important


point
 that
 is
 often
 imperfectly


appreciated
 is
 the
 following.
 In
 2008,


coincident
 with
 the
 global
 financial


crisis,
 the
 Fed
 also
 achieved
 from


Congress
 the
 statutory
 authority
 to
 pay


interest
 on
 bank
 reserves.
 Until
 that


point,
 the
 Fed
 created
 reserves
 by


buying
 securities,
 but
 they
 earned
 a


zero
 uh
 interest
 rates.
 And
 that
 not


just
 the
 Fed,
 but
 most
 other
 central


banks
 now
 pay
 a
 market
 rate
 of
 interest


on
 bank
 reserves.
 And
 the
 reason
 why


that's
 important
 is
 the
 following.
 What


it
 means
 is
 that
 when
 the
 Fed
 does
 do
 a


QE
 program,
 when
 it
 buys
 a
 mortgage


security
 or
 a
 Treasury,
 it's
 not
 really


printing
 money
 in
 the
 sort
 of
 money
 and


banking
 sense
 that
 you're
 buying
 a


coupon
 and
 paying
 for
 it
 with
 a
 $100


bill
 and
 thus
 extinguishing
 the
 coupon


payment.
 What
 you're
 really
 what
 the
 Fed


really
 does
 now
 with
 modern
 QE
 and


interest
 on
 reserves
 is
 it's
 not


extinguishing
 government
 debt.
 It's
 just


changing
 the
 maturity
 composition
 of


government
 debt
 from
 fixed
 to
 floating.


Because
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 the
 Fed's


balance
 sheet
 and
 the
 Treasury's
 balance


sheet
 are
 consolidated.
 When
 the
 Fed's


profitable,
 the
 the
 the
 Treasury
 gets


that
 interest
 income.
 In
 recent
 years,


the
 Fed
 has
 not
 been
 profitable
 and
 it's


been
 withholding
 those
 remittances.
 And


so
 once
 once
 you
 think
 of
 it
 that
 way,


then
 you
 start
 to
 think
 about
 a
 scenario


where
 a
 Treasury
 Secretary
 could,
 if
 he


chose
 to
 say,
 you
 know
 what,
 I
 want
 to


be
 the
 big
 sheriff
 in
 town
 when
 it
 comes


to
 maturity
 composition.
 So
 if
 I
 think


there
 are
 too
 many
 30-year
 treasuries,


I'll
 buy
 them
 and
 sell
 T
 bills
 and
 the


Fed
 can
 buy
 the
 T
 bills.
 And
 so
 there


are
 scenarios
 over
 time
 where
 we
 could


rethink
 what
 QE
 is
 in
 addition
 to
 what


the
 size
 of
 the
 balance
 sheet
 is.
 But


this
 is
 not,
 you
 know,
 a
 30
 minute
 or


you
 know
 a
 oneweek
 exercise.
 This
 will


be
 a
 pretty
 complicated
 intricate


process.
 But
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 rule
 out
 of


hand
 that
 it's
 something
 that
 uh
 is
 you


know
 beyond
 considering
 or
 discussing.


>> [music]


[music]


[music]


>> So
 other
 than
 his
 distaste
 for
 the
 size


and
 potentially
 composition
 of
 the
 Fed


balance
 sheet,
 there's
 something
 else


that
 Worsh
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 like,
 and


that's
 I
 guess
 traditional
 economic


models.
 So
 he's
 been
 critical
 of
 the


Phillips
 curve
 for
 instance.
 Uh
 he's


been
 critical
 of
 data
 dependency
 at
 the


Fed
 which
 kind
 of
 leaves
 the
 question
 if


you're
 not
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 data
 and


you're
 not
 going
 to
 focus
 on
 models
 what


are
 you
 actually
 using
 to
 formulate


monetary
 policy?
 Do
 you
 have
 any
 any


read
 on
 what
 that
 could
 be?


>> I
 think
 u
 you
 know
 and
 I've
 known
 Kevin


I
 think
 for
 a
 dozen
 years.
 I
 didn't
 our


our
 terms
 as
 fed
 officials
 did
 not


coincide,
 but
 I've
 gotten
 to
 know
 him


since
 and
 we've
 met
 many
 times
 and
 had


many
 conversations
 and
 the
 like
 and
 I


read
 most
 if
 not
 all
 that
 he
 writes.
 You


know,
 my
 my
 sense
 is
 really
 that
 his
 his


critique
 is
 that
 a
 lot
 of
 economic


models
 in
 macro
 tend
 to
 to
 put
 a
 lot
 of


emphasis
 on
 on
 the
 demand
 side
 of
 the


economy.
 Now
 I
 can
 point
 you
 to
 my
 first


speech
 as
 Fed
 vice
 chair
 in
 October
 2018


where
 I
 also
 put
 on
 the
 table
 that


policy
 need
 to
 think
 about
 the
 supply


side
 of
 the
 economy
 and
 the
 Fed
 doesn't


want
 to
 be
 in
 the
 business
 of
 raising


rates
 because
 too
 many
 people
 have
 a
 job


if
 that's
 not
 inflationary
 and
 the
 the


way
 you
 sort
 of
 square
 that
 circle
 is


your
 outlook
 on
 on
 on
 productivity.
 And


so
 it
 is
 correct
 that
 if
 you
 get
 more


growth
 because
 you've
 got
 a
 more


productive
 economy
 either
 through


innovation
 or
 deregulation


then
 the
 Fed
 should
 not
 get
 in
 in
 the


way
 of
 that.
 And
 indeed
 during
 my
 time


the
 pal
 Fed
 didn't
 you
 know
 the
 models


uh
 both
 in
 the
 Fed
 and
 outside
 in
 2019


were
 saying
 and
 indeed
 if
 you
 look
 at


Fed
 communication
 in
 2017
 it
 was
 saying


if
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 falls
 below
 5%


we'll
 have
 to
 hike
 rates
 because
 that's


going
 to
 be
 inflationary
 and
 by
 the
 time


I
 got
 there
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 was
 in


the
 fours
 and
 we
 didn't
 have
 inflation


and
 it
 got
 down
 to
 the
 low
 threes.
 And


so
 it
 is
 correct
 that
 there
 is
 a
 supply


as
 well
 as
 a
 demand
 side
 to
 the
 economy.


And
 if
 the
 supply
 side
 can
 grow
 faster


with
 higher
 employment
 without


inflation,
 the
 Fed
 should
 not
 get
 in
 the


way
 with
 that.
 So
 I
 I
 100%
 agree
 with


with
 with
 that.
 Now
 the
 the
 challenge
 is


the
 economy,
 as
 Jay
 Palace
 said,
 the


economy
 is
 constantly
 uh
 changing.
 And


maybe
 just
 a
 little
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


wonkish
 uh
 comment
 for
 the
 the
 wonks
 in


your
 audience.
 And
 and
 let
 me
 set
 the


record
 straight.
 Uh
 you
 know,
 the
 old


saying,
 facts
 are
 stubborn
 uh
 things.


And
 we
 all
 live,
 you
 know,
 we're
 all


three
 of
 us
 were
 around
 in
 the
 1990s.


And
 Greenspan
 is
 justly
 uh
 complimented


as
 he
 should
 be
 indeed
 what
 I
 teach
 this


material.
 I
 always
 emphasize
 this
 period


for
 recognizing
 that
 because
 of
 the


internet
 and
 connectivity
 and
 personal


computing
 that
 there
 would
 potentially


was
 an
 eminent
 increase
 in
 pickup
 in


productivity.
 And
 the
 staff
 and
 other


governors
 were
 saying
 we
 should
 hike


rates
 and
 green
 spend.
 And
 I
 said,
 "No,


let's
 see.
 we
 may
 get
 this
 may
 be
 a


productivity-led
 boom
 and
 that's
 indeed


the
 story
 between
 1995
 and
 1999


but
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 greenspan
 Fed
 in


1999
 it
 was
 hiking
 rates
 even
 though
 we


had
 very
 strong
 productivity
 growth
 and


we
 had
 strong
 economic
 growth
 in
 the


face
 of
 a
 very
 buoyant
 stock
 market
 and


what
 people
 forget
 [laughter]
 is
 that
 by


2000
 the
 federal
 funds
 rate
 was
 at
 6
 and


a
 half%
 so
 it
 is
 true
 that
 Greenspan
 did


hold
 off
 for
 several
 years,
 but
 by
 the


end
 of
 that
 of
 that
 uh
 tech
 internet
 uh


boom
 and
 dare
 I
 say
 irrational


exuberance,
 his
 famous
 phraseology,


Greenspan
 was
 hiking
 rates
 very


aggressively
 in
 the
 face
 of
 very
 strong


productivity
 growth.
 So
 when
 people


refer
 to
 that
 period
 approvingly
 as
 a


reason
 uh
 for
 the
 Fed
 to
 hold
 off
 from


from
 you
 know
 hiking
 or
 certainly


continuing
 to
 cut
 rates
 because
 of


productivity
 you
 have
 to
 look
 at
 the


entire
 decade.
 You
 just
 can't
 cherrypick


three
 or
 four
 uh
 years.
 This
 is


interesting.
 You
 know,
 just
 while
 we're


here,
 talk
 about
 Green
 Greenspan.
 I


mean,
 why
 did
 he
 raise
 rates
 so


aggressively?
 And
 did
 Greenspan's
 own


rate
 hikes
 in
 the
 late
 '9s
 not
 really


gel
 with
 his
 own
 comments
 about
 the


capacity
 for
 the
 economy
 to
 grow
 during


a
 time
 of
 expanding
 productivity?


>> The
 explanation,
 I
 would
 argue,
 was


really
 was
 really
 twofold.
 I
 I
 do
 think


by
 that
 time
 although
 I
 haven't


memorized
 the
 memoir
 but
 but
 I
 think
 by


that
 time
 the
 the
 irrational
 exuberance


piece
 was
 a
 factor
 there
 is
 a
 there
 is
 a


wealth
 effect
 so
 if
 stocks
 are
 going
 up


people
 are
 wealthy
 they
 spend
 more
 and


so
 central
 banks
 don't
 like
 to
 be
 in
 the


business
 of
 of
 pricking
 uh
 bubbles
 but


there
 is
 a
 connectivity
 between
 a
 very


very
 fully
 valued
 stock
 market
 and
 your


macro
 outlook
 you
 know
 we
 all
 remember


some
 of
 us
 remember
 Pets.com
 you
 know


the
 sock
 puppet
 Super
 Bowl
 commercials


and
 also
 I
 just
 think
 by
 that
 point


although
 inflation
 had
 not
 moved
 above
 I


should
 also
 mention
 the
 other


fascinating
 thing
 about
 that
 period
 is


it's
 clear
 now
 from
 the
 transcripts
 that


the
 Greenspan
 Fed
 by
 the
 mid
 to
 late
 90s


was
 in
 essence
 running
 what
 we
 would
 now


call
 an
 inflation
 targeting
 regime
 and


that
 the
 target
 was
 two
 but
 Greenspan


was
 always
 resistant
 to
 the
 idea
 the
 Fed


should
 ever
 publicly
 say
 that
 they
 were


targeting
 2%
 inflation
 but
 by
 the
 late


90s
 you
 have
 inflation
 moving
 up
 close


to
 2%
 and
 you
 could
 really
 I
 view
 this


as
 a
 period
 where
 Greenspan's
 basically


saying
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the


bad
 old
 days
 of
 8
 7
 5%
 you
 know


inflation
 and
 so
 it
 was
 probably


preemptive
 as
 well
 not
 resisting
 the


productivity
 but
 merely
 uh
 trying
 to
 to


keep
 the
 economy
 in
 in
 balance
 and
 then


the
 final
 thing
 I'll
 say
 sorry
 to
 be


wonky
 is
 that
 as
 a
 matter
 of
 economic


modeling
 other
 things
 being
 equal
 if


you've
 got
 faster
 productivity
 growth,


you'd
 expect
 that
 to
 move
 up
 what


economists
 call
 the
 neutral
 rate
 of


interest
 anyway.
 And
 I
 think
 actually


Bill
 Dudley
 made
 that
 point
 in
 his


column
 as
 um
 as
 well.


>> Never
 apologize
 for
 being
 wonky
 on
 this


show.


>> Good.


>> I
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 question
 of


central
 bank
 independence.
 So
 if
 if
 we


assume
 that
 Worsh
 truly
 wants
 to
 do
 his


own
 thing
 outside
 of
 presidential


influence
 and
 again
 there
 are
 there
 are


some
 people
 who
 doubt
 that
 is
 the
 case


but
 if
 we
 take
 that
 premise
 how
 does
 he


actually
 display
 or
 demonstrate
 the


central
 bank's
 independence
 when
 you


have
 a
 president
 who
 likes
 to
 talk
 about


interest
 rates
 and
 likes
 to
 joke
 as
 we


were
 saying
 earlier
 about
 you
 know
 I'm


going
 to
 sue
 War
 if
 he
 doesn't
 lower


rates.


>> You
 also
 use
 the
 word
 campaign
 in
 you


Kevin
 Wars's
 campaign,
 which
 I
 thought


was
 an
 interesting
 choice
 of
 words
 to


describe
 the
 last
 several
 months.


>> That's
 okay.
 Uh
 that's
 he
 he's
 he's
 a


very
 he's
 a
 good
 choice.
 And
 there
 there


were
 three
 other
 candidates
 and
 um
 and


and
 it
 worked.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 there'll


be
 a
 couple
 things
 uh
 Tracy
 that
 that


we'll
 we'll
 see
 pretty
 soon.
 In
 fact,


I'll
 let
 I'll
 let
 you
 and
 your
 listeners


decide
 if
 it's
 a
 it's
 a
 joke.
 But
 one


thing
 I
 find
 humorous,
 I'll
 share
 with


you
 is
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 if
 if
 JPL


really
 wanted
 to
 complicate
 the


situation
 for
 his
 successor,
 you
 know,


he
 cut
 rates
 at
 the
 March
 and
 the
 and


the
 April
 uh
 meeting
 to
 get
 the
 funds


rate
 down
 to
 the
 level
 where
 at least


[laughter]
 the
 committee
 seems
 to
 think


is
 the
 destination
 so
 that
 there's


nothing
 for
 the
 next
 person
 to
 do.
 I


don't
 think
 Powell's
 going
 to
 to
 do
 that


because
 I
 don't
 think
 it's


>> monetary
 policy
 by
 trolling.
 I
 don't


know
 if
 that's
 a
 that
 doesn't
 sound
 like


a
 Powell
 thing,
 but
 that
 would
 be
 funny.


Yeah,
 but
 you
 know,
 but
 but
 but
 but


there
 is
 a
 kernel
 of
 of
 truth
 to
 it,


which
 is
 as
 we
 said
 earlier
 in
 the
 in


the
 podcast,
 the
 power
 of
 the
 chair
 is


the
 power
 of
 persuasion.
 Wars
 will
 only


have
 one
 vote.
 You've
 got
 some
 very
 very


highprofile
 and
 confident
 people.


There's
 a
 voting
 rotation
 as
 your


listeners
 know.
 So
 right
 now
 you've
 got


folks
 like
 Beth
 Hammock
 and
 you've
 got


Lori
 Logan,
 Neil
 Qashqari
 in
 Minnesota


are
 are
 voting
 now
 and
 and
 Anna
 Pollson


in
 in
 Philadelphia.
 I
 I
 believe
 and
 you


know
 and
 Lori
 Logan
 and
 and
 and
 and


Hammock
 and
 and
 Kosh
 Curry
 will
 not
 will


not
 be
 shy
 publicly
 or
 I'm
 sure
 in
 the


meetings
 if
 they
 disagree
 with
 what
 they


would
 perceive
 and
 I'm
 not
 saying
 wars


would
 do
 this
 as
 you
 know
 we're
 going
 to


keep
 cutting
 rates
 below
 a
 level
 where


the
 committee
 seems
 to
 have
 a
 broad


sense
 that
 the
 neutral
 rate
 the


destination
 rate
 is
 going
 to
 be


somewhere
 in
 the
 low
 threes
 you
 know


three
 and
 a
 quarter
 three
 whatever
 and


so
 I
 do
 think
 that
 we'll
 under
 the
 sort


of
 baseline
 scenario
 for
 the
 economy
 uh


we
 we
 may
 get
 to
 that
 level
 of
 rates
 uh


sometime
 this
 year
 and
 then
 at
 that


point
 the
 issue
 would
 be
 depending
 on
 if


there's
 political
 pressure
 on
 on
 how
 the


worst
 Fed
 would
 navigate
 that
 and
 my


sense
 is
 notwithstanding
 all
 the


discussion
 of
 the
 supply
 side
 benefits


of
 of
 AI
 and
 and
 deregulation


you
 know
 if
 if
 the
 hint
 or
 the


discussion
 of
 a
 future
 rate
 cut
 would


would
 trigger
 nervousness
 in
 the


financial
 markets,
 break
 even
 inflations


go
 up,
 expected
 inflation
 measures
 go


up.
 You
 know,
 I
 think
 Worsh
 would
 and
 I


think
 War
 and
 the
 Fed
 would
 take
 that


seriously.
 So
 my
 my
 read
 is
 that
 he
 will


he
 will
 navigate
 the
 data
 as
 it
 comes.


uh
 he'll
 he'll
 want
 to
 focus
 on
 the


supply
 side,
 but
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the


day,
 look,
 no
 no no no no
 Fed
 chair


wants
 to
 go
 down
 in
 the
 history
 books
 as


the
 Fed
 chair
 that
 squandered
 40
 years


of
 price
 of
 stability.
 And
 uh
 and
 so
 at


the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 and
 this
 is
 I
 think


perhaps
 what
 the
 president
 was
 referring


to
 on
 more
 than
 one
 occasion
 when
 he
 was


thinking
 about
 who
 he
 was
 going
 to


choose.
 I'm
 paraphrasing,
 but
 he
 said


something
 like,
 you
 know,
 people
 will


say
 one
 thing
 and
 then
 they
 get
 in
 the


job
 and
 they
 disappoint
 you.
 And
 so
 I


think
 that
 that's
 an
 element
 of
 the
 of


the
 institution
 and
 of
 the
 committee


structure
 that
 will
 continue
 to
 be


relevant.


>> It's
 so
 interesting.
 I
 mean
 something


that's
 interesting
 is
 when
 we
 you


mentioned
 the
 40
 years
 of
 general
 price


stability.
 It's
 interesting
 that
 like


Arthur
 Burns
 that
 is
 a
 name
 that
 has
 a


lot
 of
 it's
 been
 tarnished
 right
 because


of
 the
 inflation.
 And
 yet
 Bernani,
 who


you
 know
 went
 through
 the
 the
 great


financial
 crisis,
 the
 worst
 downturn


ever,
 by
 and
 large
 is
 remembered
 as


having
 been
 a
 very
 good
 central
 bank


chief.
 And
 so
 it's
 striking
 that,
 yeah,


you
 have
 a
 few
 years
 of
 inflation,


everything,
 oh,
 you're
 a
 disaster.
 But


if
 you
 have
 a
 great
 recession
 underneath


your
 uh
 term,
 by
 and
 large,
 you
 could


still
 have
 a
 pretty
 good
 reputation.
 I


want
 to
 ask
 though,
 you
 know,
 the
 thing


is
 right
 now
 we
 still
 have
 above
 target


inflation
 and
 maybe
 AI
 will
 drive
 a


productivity
 boom
 and
 allow
 the
 economy


to
 grow
 very
 fast
 with
 low
 rates
 etc.
 In


the
 here
 and
 now
 though
 we
 we
 haven't


even
 gotten
 back
 to
 2%
 yet
 and
 so
 and
 a


lot
 of
 these
 benefits
 of
 AI
 still
 very


theoretical.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 I
 I'll
 I'll
 be
 even
 more


blunt.
 I
 I
 think
 you
 can
 make
 a
 case


that
 although
 longer
 term
 AI
 uh
 will
 be


disinflationary
 as
 the
 productivity


benefits
 arrive,
 you
 can
 I
 think
 you


make
 a
 very
 plausible
 case
 that
 between


between
 now
 and
 then


the
 capex
 buildout


>> to
 train
 the
 models
 is
 going
 to
 be


increasing
 demand
 in
 a
 fully
 employed


economy
 before
 the
 productivity
 benefits


arise.
 And
 so
 if
 I
 were
 still
 teaching


intermediate
 macro,
 this
 would
 actually


be
 a
 pretty
 interesting
 uh
 case
 study
 to


go
 on
 on
 the
 chalkboard
 that
 in
 5
 years


you've
 got
 more
 GDP
 per
 worker.
 That's


great.
 That's
 disinflationary.
 But


between
 now
 and
 year
 five,
 you're
 going


to
 be
 double
 doubling
 your
 tech
 capital


spending
 investment,
 which
 is
 adding


demand
 before
 the
 productivity
 benefits


show
 up.
 So
 it's
 not
 a
 slam
 dunk
 to
 me


at
 all
 about
 what
 about
 what
 AI
 means


for
 for
 monetary
 policy
 near-term
 even


though
 maybe
 in
 five
 years
 the


productivity
 benefits
 are
 so
 large
 it
 it


will
 it
 will
 have
 a
 different
 you
 know


tend
 to
 be
 disinflationary.
 So
 I
 think


it's
 AI
 is
 complicated
 along
 every


dimension
 you
 can
 think.
 It's
 a


complicated
 technology.
 It
 has


complicated
 economics
 and
 social


potential
 ramifications
 and
 I
 think
 it's


it's
 not
 a
 slam
 dunk
 easy
 situation
 for


the
 for
 the
 central
 bank
 either.
 I
 have


one
 last
 question
 about
 central
 bank


independence.
 Setting
 aside
 Wars's


comments,
 something
 we
 haven't
 talked


about
 at
 all
 is
 the
 subpoena
 to
 Jerome


Powell
 over
 the
 um
 over
 the
 offices
 over


the
 renovation.
 Powell
 was
 very
 specific


in
 that
 he
 thought
 the
 subpoena
 was


motivated
 by
 punishing
 him
 or
 trying
 to


get
 back
 at
 him
 for
 doing
 rate
 policy


that
 the
 president
 didn't
 like.
 Two


things
 related
 to
 that.
 A,
 does
 the


subpoena
 in
 your
 view
 sort
 of
 add
 to


your
 worry
 either
 medium
 or
 long
 term


about
 how
 long
 the
 central
 bank
 truly


will
 be
 an
 independent
 institution
 in


the
 United
 States.
 And
 a
 correlary
 to


that,
 you
 mentioned
 Powell
 control
 the


uh
 wars
 by
 cut
 doing
 all
 the
 rate
 cuts.


Now,
 what
 do
 you
 see
 as
 the
 odds
 that
 he


stays
 on
 the
 board
 until
 his
 term
 as


governor
 ends
 even
 if
 he's
 no
 longer


chair?


>> First
 of
 all,
 there
 is
 there
 is


precedent
 and
 the
 Fed's
 a
 very
 very


president
 focused
 institution.
 Legendary


Fed
 chair
 indeed
 had
 a
 building
 named


after
 him.
 Mariner
 Eckles
 was
 an
 FDR


appointee
 and
 then
 when
 Harry
 Truman


became
 president,
 Harry
 Truman
 named


another
 Fed
 chair
 and
 Eckles
 stayed
 on


and
 and
 actually
 became
 a
 real
 thorn
 in


Truman's
 side.
 I
 would
 be
 surprised
 if


J.
 Pal
 stays
 on
 for
 the
 remainder
 of
 his


term
 as
 governor,
 which
 which
 runs


through
 uh
 January
 of
 2020.


Would
 I
 be
 shocked
 if
 he
 stayed
 for
 a


meeting
 or
 or
 two?
 No.
 Only
 Powell


knows.
 He's
 been
 asked
 that
 question
 two


dozen
 times
 and
 he
 always
 gives
 the
 same


answer.
 But
 but
 I
 sense
 he's
 probably


not
 going
 to
 be
 staying
 on,
 you
 know,
 in


terms
 of
 this
 case,
 you
 know,
 I
 pal's
 uh


comments
 can
 can
 um
 you
 know,
 stand
 for


themselves.
 I
 won't
 weigh
 in.
 What
 I


will
 say
 though
 is
 we
 have
 not
 only
 this


the
 current
 thing
 that
 you
 just


mentioned
 about
 investigation
 on
 the
 on


the
 building,
 you
 know,
 we
 also
 have
 the


Lisa
 Cook
 case.


is
 going
 to
 weigh
 in
 on
 on
 on
 that.
 And


this
 is
 all
 sort
 of
 tied
 up
 into
 this


idea
 of
 can
 Congress
 establish
 a
 central


bank
 with
 a
 degree
 of
 independence
 to


raise
 or
 lower
 uh
 rates.
 And
 an


important
 element
 of
 this
 is
 this
 idea


of
 four
 cause
 removal.
 You
 know,
 beyond


that,
 it's
 just
 going
 to
 play
 out
 and
 I


don't
 have
 any
 particular
 expertise


about
 where
 it
 will
 end.
 But
 I
 will
 say


is
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day
 I
 do
 expect


that
 the
 Fed
 is
 an
 institution
 and
 it's


will
 have
 sufficient
 independence
 to


raise
 or
 lower
 rates
 because
 of
 its


institutional
 structure
 and
 I
 think


ultimately
 the
 courts
 are
 going
 to
 back


that
 up.


>> All
 right,
 Richard
 Clara
 truly
 the


perfect
 guest.
 Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for


coming
 back
 on
 All
 Thoughts.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thanks,
 Rich.
 That
 was
 great.


>> [music]


>> So,
 that
 was
 a
 really
 fun
 conversation.


I
 like
 the
 idea
 or
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 like
 I


am
 intrigued
 by
 the
 idea
 of
 uh
 monetary


policy
 by
 trolling.
 [laughter]


>> That'd
 be
 so
 funny
 if
 there
 was
 like
 no


room
 left
 to
 cut
 by
 the
 time
 Kevin
 got


there
 and
 then
 he
 couldn't
 um
 fulfill


any
 inclination
 to
 cut.
 But
 I
 think
 it


actually
 raises
 an
 important
 point
 and


I'm
 thinking
 back
 to
 the
 conversation
 we


did
 with
 Emmy
 Nakamura
 where
 she
 talks


about
 central
 banks
 building
 up
 a
 sort


of
 store
 of
 credibility
 and
 then
 having


to
 spend
 it
 at
 various
 points.
 If
 you


have
 a
 president
 who
 is
 so
 opinionated


when
 it
 comes
 to
 interest
 rates
 and


certainly
 not
 shy
 about
 tweeting
 or


talking
 about
 them,
 I
 feel
 like
 it


inherently
 starts
 to
 spend
 down
 some
 of


that
 credibility
 because
 it
 just
 becomes


very
 very
 difficult
 I
 think
 to


demonstrate
 your
 own
 independence.


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 really


tricky.
 You
 know,
 it's
 obviously


something
 we
 talked
 about
 with
 Scand


last
 week,
 which
 is
 that
 there's


multiple
 potential
 nominees
 who
 would


have
 come
 in
 with
 a
 willingness
 to
 cut


rates
 further
 at
 this
 point.
 Christopher


Waller
 being
 an
 obvious
 one.
 He's
 been


voting
 for
 rate
 cuts,
 but
 he
 also
 has
 a


lot
 of
 credibility
 because
 he
 was
 voting


for
 rate
 hikes
 and,
 you
 know,
 2022,


2023,
 and
 so
 forth.
 I
 think
 it's
 going


to
 be
 uh,
 you
 know,
 it'll
 be
 tricky
 for


War
 and
 But
 on
 the
 other
 hand,
 look,
 I


would
 say
 also,
 you
 know,
 it's
 easy
 to


say,
 oh,
 he's
 got
 to
 come
 in,
 he's
 got


to
 build
 credibility.
 A
 lot
 of
 people


really
 like
 him.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 who


have
 worked
 with
 him
 at
 various
 times,


who
 have
 known
 him
 think
 he's
 a
 serious


thinker,
 that
 he
 knows
 what
 he's
 talking


about,
 that
 even
 if
 he
 doesn't
 always


agree
 with
 them,
 particularly
 on
 things


related
 to
 the
 balance
 sheet


communication,
 that
 he's
 a
 honest


broker.
 So
 maybe,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 we
 are


overstating
 the
 risks
 or
 maybe
 it's
 easy


to
 overstate
 the
 risk
 that
 he
 comes
 in


and
 has
 a
 real
 fight
 on
 his
 hands
 to
 get


the
 uh
 policy
 agenda
 that
 he
 wants.


>> Oh,
 to
 be
 a
 fly
 on
 the
 wall
 of
 the
 first


meeting
 with
 War,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 that'll
 it'll
 be
 uh
 it'll
 be
 super


interesting.
 I
 also
 really
 like
 I
 wonder


if
 he's
 going
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 the
 press


conference.
 That's
 my
 prediction.


>> I
 would
 not
 be
 surprised.
 And
 you
 know


what
 I'll
 say
 like
 [snorts]


>> these
 are
 new
 things.
 It's
 not
 a
 it's


it's
 not
 like
 he'd
 be
 overturning
 80


years
 of
 president
 here.
 This
 is
 a
 very


modern
 thing.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 the


communications
 innovations
 were
 as
 rich


said
 a
 very
 specific
 purpose
 when
 the


Fed
 was
 at
 Zerp
 to
 convince
 the
 market


that
 it
 would
 stay
 low
 because
 and
 they


needed
 to
 make
 that
 case.
 So
 if
 there's


a
 sort
 of
 honest
 look
 at
 all
 of
 these


postGFC
 monetary
 policy
 changes,
 I
 don't


I
 I
 [clears throat]
 certainly
 think


that's
 totally
 fine.


>> I
 think
 Jackson
 Hole
 might
 be
 in
 danger,


too.


>> You
 think
 so?


>> Yeah,
 maybe.
 [sighs and gasps]
 just
 out


of
 pure
 self-interest.
 I
 hope
 not.
 I


hope
 not,
 too.
 I
 like
 enjoy
 going
 to
 one


of
 the
 most
 beautiful
 places
 on
 Earth


every
 year.
 But
 we'll
 see.


>> Yeah.
 Uh
 I
 hope
 I
 hope
 it
 doesn't
 go


away.


>> All right.

 we
 leave
 it
