Today
 [music]
 in
 the
 first
 of
 a
 series


of
 episodes
 evaluating
 the
 past
 year,
 we


begin
 by
 turning
 to
 three
 of
 my


colleagues,
 [music]
 Maggie
 Haberman,


Jonathan
 Swan,
 and
 Charlie
 Savage.


[music]


It's
 Tuesday,
 January
 20th.


Maggie,
 Jonathan,
 Charlie,


welcome
 back.


>> Thank
 you,
 Michael.


>> Hello.
 Good
 to
 be
 back.
 We
 come
 to
 the


three
 of
 you
 on
 the
 occasion
 of
 this


presidential
 term
 reaching
 its
 one-year


mark.
 Always
 a
 moment
 for
 reflection,


perhaps
 never
 more
 so
 than
 the
 extremely


eventful
 first
 year
 of
 Donald
 Trump's


second
 term.
 And
 all
 three
 of
 you


covered
 Trump's
 first
 term
 and
 then
 you


co-reported
 a
 series
 about
 what
 we


should
 all
 expect
 from
 his
 second
 term,


much
 of
 which
 came
 to
 pass.
 And
 as
 it


happens,
 all
 three
 of
 you
 are
 now


working
 on
 books
 about
 Trump
 and
 his


presidency.
 So,
 you're
 thinking
 big


thoughts,
 or
 at least
 we're
 hoping
 that


you're
 thinking
 big
 thoughts.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 the
 encouragement.


>> You're
 uniquely
 positioned,
 we
 think,
 to


have
 this
 conversation.
 Hope
 you
 agree.


So,
 we
 wanted
 to
 start
 by
 asking
 you
 for


the
 right
 big
 framework
 for
 thinking


about
 this
 first
 year
 of
 Donald
 Trump's


second
 term.
 And
 Jonathan,
 let
 me
 start


with
 you
 there.
 Where
 I
 start


conceptually
 with
 Trump
 is
 basically


where
 we
 started
 with
 our
 series
 in


2023,
 which
 is
 the
 first
 big
 idea
 that


we
 put
 out
 there
 based
 on
 our
 reporting,


based
 on
 talking
 to
 all
 the
 people


around
 Trump
 was
 that
 a
 second
 term
 of


Donald
 Trump
 would
 involve
 extravagant


uses
 of
 executive
 power.


>> In
 some
 cases,
 possibly
 unprecedented


use
 of
 executive
 power.
 And
 it
 became


very
 clear
 early
 on
 that
 that's
 exactly


what
 was
 coming
 to
 bear.
 There
 were
 just


so
 many
 aggressive
 actions
 happening
 at


once.
 It
 was
 happening
 in
 his


immigration
 actions,
 in
 his
 use
 of


tariffs.
 We
 saw
 it
 in
 the
 way
 that
 he


attacked
 civil
 society,
 the
 way
 that
 he


squeezed
 universities.


We
 have
 agencies
 within
 the
 executive


branch
 that
 either
 by
 law
 or
 by
 custom


are
 understood
 to
 be
 independent
 from


executive
 authority
 from
 the
 president


himself.
 He
 completely
 jettisoned
 that.


You
 have
 a
 situation
 where
 he
 is


directing
 the
 attorney
 general
 to


prosecute
 named
 individuals,


>> something
 that
 we
 haven't
 seen
 in
 this


country
 before.
 You
 also
 had
 him
 sort
 of


jawboning
 the
 FCC
 to
 go
 after
 certain


media
 companies.
 Again,
 agencies
 that


are
 either
 by
 statute
 or
 by
 norm


independent
 no
 longer
 are
 independent.


You
 know,
 we've
 all
 forgotten
 Doge
 now,


but
 that
 was
 an
 extraordinary
 expression


of
 executive
 authority.
 So,
 it's
 already


a
 year
 in
 a
 profoundly
 transformational


presidency.
 And
 when
 I
 think
 about
 it,


it
 all
 comes
 back
 to
 this
 conception
 of


power
 that
 power
 belongs
 to
 Donald
 Trump


and
 that
 any
 checks
 upon
 his
 power
 are


illegitimate
 and
 ought
 to
 be
 bulldozed.


Maggie,
 what's
 the
 framework
 you
 have


been
 using
 for
 this
 first
 year?


>> Oh,
 I
 agree
 with
 everything
 Jonathan


said
 and
 I
 just
 will
 add
 a
 few
 things.


One
 is
 there
 [snorts]
 is
 this
 sort
 of


personalization
 of
 power
 where
 not
 only


targeting
 his
 enemies,
 perceived
 enemies


I
 should
 say,
 for
 prosecution
 through


the
 DOJ,
 but
 targeting
 law
 firms
 that
 he


felt
 agrieved
 by
 or
 some
 of
 his
 own


lawyers
 felt
 agrieved
 by
 with
 threats
 of


executive
 orders
 or
 actual
 executive


orders.
 He
 is
 clearly
 in
 sort
 of
 a
 he
 is


owed
 his
 due
 phase
 where
 he
 believes
 he


was
 harmed
 and
 he
 believes
 that
 he


should
 have
 some
 kind
 of
 compensation


for
 that
 literally
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 he


wants
 the
 DOJ
 and
 he
 openly
 said
 this
 to


give
 him
 a
 settlement
 for
 some
 of
 the


investigations
 into
 him.
 He
 runs
 this


justice
 department


>> right?
 He
 wants
 the
 United
 States


Department
 of
 Justice,
 which
 he


oversees,
 to
 literally
 financially


compensate
 him
 for
 a
 previous
 legal


grievance
 he
 has.


>> And
 and
 not
 a
 small
 amount,
 we
 should


say.


>> No.
 Well,
 I
 mean,
 the
 claim
 was,
 I
 think


it
 was
 $230
 million.
 Usually
 settlements


are
 not
 that
 much,
 but
 whatever
 it
 is,


it
 will
 be
 more
 than
 zero.
 You
 know,
 you


go
 back
 all
 the
 way
 to
 earlier
 in
 the


year,
 a
 story
 that
 Jonathan
 and
 I
 did


with
 Eric
 Lipton
 about
 Trump's


frustration
 about
 not
 having
 the
 new
 Air


Force
 ones
 that
 he
 had
 commissioned,
 the


planes
 in
 term
 one
 that
 are
 delayed


because
 of
 all
 kinds
 of
 issues.
 So


instead,
 he's
 being
 the
 government,
 I


should
 say,
 is
 being
 gifted
 a
 luxury
 jet


that
 was
 owned
 by
 the
 once
 owned
 by
 the


Qatari
 royal
 family.
 his
 government


found
 this
 creative
 way
 to
 have
 it
 given


to
 the
 defense
 department
 and
 then
 it's


just
 going
 to
 be
 gifted
 to
 his


presidential
 library
 and
 he
 says
 that
 he


doesn't
 plan
 to
 fly
 it
 afterwards
 and


some
 of
 his
 own
 advisers
 privately
 say


they
 find
 that
 hard
 to
 believe.
 So,
 so


you
 can
 run
 the
 gamut
 on
 this
 of
 ways
 in


which
 he
 sees
 himself
 as
 owed
 a
 due.


That
 is
 the
 frame
 through
 which
 I
 am


seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 this


>> the
 personalization
 of
 power.
 Yeah,


>> I
 think
 another
 element
 of
 this
 that's


really
 important
 if
 you
 sort
 of
 think


about
 it
 under
 the,
 you
 know,


reparations
 for
 Donald
 Trump
 umbrella
 is


in
 this
 second
 term,
 he's
 thinking
 a
 lot


about
 legacy
 and
 building
 monuments
 to


himself,
 but
 the
 money
 is
 being


extracted
 from
 corporate
 America.
 Why


are
 they
 spending
 all
 this
 money?
 Well,


he's
 building
 this
 big
 ballroom
 which


will
 be
 seen
 as
 Donald
 Trump's
 ballroom


at
 the
 White
 House.
 Why
 are
 corporations


donating
 5
 million,
 10
 million?
 They're


doing
 it
 out
 of
 fear.
 Obviously.


Obviously.
 I
 mean,
 we
 talked
 to
 a
 lot
 of


people
 who
 represent
 and
 work
 at
 a


senior
 level
 at
 different
 corporations.


This
 is
 small
 change
 for
 them
 knowing


that
 this
 is
 a
 president
 who's
 perfectly


willing
 to
 use
 the
 federal
 government
 to


hurt
 them,
 help
 them.
 And
 what
 you're


diagnosing
 here,
 I
 think,
 is
 kind
 of


fascinating
 to
 bring
 it
 together
 with


what
 you
 said,
 Maggie.
 The
 president
 is


personalizing
 power,
 and
 that
 becomes


self-reinforcing.
 He
 personalized


revenge.
 Correct.
 And
 what
 does
 that
 do?


It
 ends
 up
 encouraging
 the
 targets
 or


the
 avoiding
 targets
 of
 that
 revenge
 to


then
 fund
 the
 self-immortalization


side
 of
 the
 personalization
 of
 the


presidency.
 And
 it
 becomes
 a
 virtuous


cycle
 for
 him.


>> Exactly.
 You
 also
 had
 him,
 you
 know,


renaming
 the
 Kennedy
 Center,
 the
 Trump


Kennedy
 Center,
 making
 the
 Institute
 of


Peace,
 the
 Donald
 J.
 Trump
 Institute
 of


Peace.
 In
 many
 ways,
 it's
 these
 are


things
 that
 I
 can
 do
 with
 the


presidency.
 There's
 no
 legal
 impediment,


so
 I'm
 going
 to
 do
 them.
 He
 wants
 to


rename
 Dallasos
 airport
 the
 Trump


airport.
 He
 wants
 a
 version
 of
 the


Arctic
 triumph,
 which
 they
 call


internally
 the
 Arctic
 Trump
 built.
 So,


that's
 a
 big
 part
 of
 this.
 It's
 putting


his
 imprint,
 his
 physical
 imprint,
 on


Washington
 DC.
 And
 you
 guys
 all
 screwed


me
 last
 time.
 you
 know,
 you
 stole
 the


election,
 you
 tried
 to
 put
 me
 in
 jail,


and
 I'm
 back.
 And
 guess
 what?
 You
 have


to
 reckon
 with
 me
 now,
 and
 I'm
 just


going
 to
 rub
 this
 in
 your
 faces.
 And
 one


thing
 about
 Donald
 Trump
 is
 he
 knows
 how


to
 use
 power
 aggressively.
 Correct.
 And


that's
 the
 story
 of
 this
 first
 year
 is


Donald
 Trump
 aggressively


asserting
 power
 and
 largely
 succeeding.


>> And
 Charlie,
 what
 is
 your
 framework
 for


thinking
 about
 this?
 We're
 talking
 about


power
 and
 its
 consolidation.
 We're


talking
 about
 the
 personalization
 of


that
 power,


>> right?
 So,
 a
 running
 theme
 in
 what


Jonathan
 Maggie
 you've
 been
 talking


about
 is
 Trump
 exercising
 power
 until


somebody
 stops
 him.
 And
 Congress
 right


now
 controlled
 by
 a
 Republican
 party


that
 is
 completely
 in
 his
 thrral.


Clearly,
 he's
 not
 going
 to
 stop
 him.


There
 will
 be
 an
 election
 later
 this


year.
 We'll
 see
 if
 at least
 one
 chamber


flips.
 then
 there
 could
 start
 to
 be


significant,
 you
 know,
 meaningful


oversight
 investigations.
 Although
 we


saw
 that
 in
 the
 first
 Trump
 term
 and
 the


answer
 to
 those
 investigations
 were


stonewalling
 of
 subpoenas
 and
 such.
 And


so
 if
 Congress
 currently
 it
 clearly
 is


going
 to
 do
 nothing
 and
 you
 know
 the


question
 arises
 whether
 even
 under


Democratic
 control
 it
 can
 effectively
 do


something
 that
 leaves
 you
 with
 the


courts,


>> right?
 And
 the
 big
 question
 being
 to


what
 extent
 is
 this
 judiciary
 going
 to


ratify


or
 at least
 not
 stand
 in
 the
 way
 of


these
 extraordinary
 myriad
 ways
 in
 which


he's
 assuming
 and
 exercising
 powers
 that


were
 not
 previously
 clearly
 understood


to
 reside
 in
 the
 White
 House.


>> It's
 it's
 a
 little
 hard
 to
 talk
 about


this
 right
 now
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 the


litigation
 over
 this
 stuff
 is


unresolved.
 A
 lot
 of
 people
 think
 it
 is


possible
 that
 the
 court
 may
 strike
 down


his
 unilateral
 imposition
 of
 import


taxes
 or
 tariffs
 and
 that
 may
 be
 a
 big


exception
 to
 an
 overall
 pattern.
 But


from
 the
 vantage
 point
 right
 now,
 for


the
 most
 part,
 while
 he
 has
 been
 stymied


initially
 by
 lower
 court
 judges
 a
 lot,


when
 stuff
 has
 reached
 the
 Supreme


Court,
 it
 has
 by
 and
 large
 allowed
 him


to
 do
 what
 he
 wants
 to
 do.


>> Right.
 And
 just
 to
 distill
 what
 you're


saying,
 the
 courts,
 especially
 the
 high


court,
 the
 Supreme
 Court,
 has
 and


appears
 poised
 to
 continue
 to
 ratify,


codify,
 whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call
 it,


this
 expanded
 power
 of
 this
 presidency,


which
 is
 much
 greater
 than
 probably
 any


modern
 presidency.
 I
 mean,
 can
 I
 just


ask
 that
 question,
 Jonathan?
 Is
 there
 a


precedent
 that
 you
 can
 think
 of
 for
 the


exercise
 of
 this
 level
 of
 power
 by
 the


president?


>> Well,
 we
 have
 lots
 of
 precedents
 of


presidents.
 I
 mean,
 of
 course,
 everyone


references
 Franklin
 Roosevelt
 and
 him


breaking
 a
 lot
 of
 norms,
 very
 aggressive


use
 of
 executive
 power
 with
 the
 New
 Deal


programs.


>> Endorsed
 by
 Congress
 though,
 big


difference.


>> Definitely.
 And
 and
 when
 you've
 seen


huge
 abuses
 in
 the
 past,
 it's
 generally


been
 in
 wartime.
 So,
 you
 know,
 Woodro


Wilson,
 there
 were
 terrible
 abuses


against
 the
 press
 and
 civil
 society,


unions,
 obviously
 Franklin
 Roosevelt


with
 the
 internment
 camps.
 But
 again,
 in


nonwart
 time,
 we're
 not
 in
 the
 middle
 of


a
 great
 depression.
 There
 is
 no


precedent
 for
 the
 breadth
 of
 aggressive


assertion
 of
 executive
 power
 and
 even


many
 of
 the
 instances
 of
 executive
 power


that
 we're
 seeing
 used
 right
 now
 by


Donald
 Trump.
 M


>> and
 I
 think
 there's
 another
 point
 that's


really
 important
 that
 we
 haven't
 talked


about
 yet,
 which
 is
 one
 reason
 why
 I


think
 it's
 very
 likely
 that
 Donald
 Trump


ends
 up
 being
 the
 most
 consequential


president
 of
 our
 lifetimes
 is
 that
 it


seems
 to
 me
 very
 unlikely
 that
 we
 go


back
 to
 the
 way
 it
 was
 before
 after
 this


experience.
 We're
 in
 an
 environment


where
 there's
 not
 a
 huge
 constituency


for
 a
 restorationist
 president
 for


people
 to
 say,
 "Oh,
 actually,
 I
 really


hope
 the
 next
 president
 will
 voluntarily


restrain
 themselves
 and
 exercise


prudence
 and
 respect
 the
 balance
 of


powers."
 What's
 far
 more
 likely
 is
 that


if
 the
 other
 side
 gets
 in,
 if
 Democrats


get
 in,
 that
 their
 voters
 are
 going
 to


want
 to
 see
 a
 president
 use
 all
 of
 these


extravagant
 powers
 for
 their


>> policy
 desires
 and
 policy
 goals.


That
 is
 a
 very
 appealing
 thing.
 And
 so


you
 you've
 seen
 now
 Trump
 act


unilaterally
 in
 all
 sorts
 of
 ways
 that


has
 now
 opened
 up
 a
 new
 panorama
 for


every
 other
 leader
 who
 follows
 him.
 Are


we
 going
 to
 see
 a
 reaction
 like
 we
 saw


post
 Nixon,
 you
 know,
 where
 Carter


essentially
 ran
 on
 good
 government


restraint
 and
 all
 this
 sort
 of
 stuff?


>> I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 a
 very
 different


context.
 It's
 a
 very
 different
 context


than
 it
 was
 back
 then.
 And
 so
 I
 think


Trump
 is
 more
 likely
 to
 have
 set
 a


precedent
 that
 will
 be
 followed,
 perhaps


even
 expanded
 upon,
 as
 hard
 as
 that


might
 be
 to
 imagine,
 than
 it
 is
 that


will
 have
 some
 sort
 of
 restoration
 uh
 to


the
 way
 it
 was
 after
 Donald
 Trump,


>> right?
 That
 Humpty
 Dumpty
 doesn't
 get


put
 back
 together
 again.


>> Totally.
 And
 I
 think
 Jonathan
 raises
 a


really
 important
 point,
 which
 is
 that
 in


this
 world
 we're
 living
 in
 now
 where


both
 parties,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 it's
 taking


place
 exactly
 the
 same
 way
 or
 exactly


the
 same
 levels,
 but
 they're
 radicalized


about
 each
 other.
 You
 know,
 January
 6th


was
 a
 radicalizing
 day
 for
 Democrats
 and


some
 Republicans
 who
 lived
 through
 it
 in


the
 capital.
 Trump
 and
 his
 advisers
 have


been
 radicalized
 by
 two
 assassination


attempts,


>> two
 impeachment
 efforts,


>> two
 impeachment
 efforts,
 uh
 various


indictments,
 all
 of
 them
 getting


subpoenaed.
 many
 of
 his
 advisers
 and


many
 people
 who
 worked
 in
 that
 White


House
 unable
 to
 get
 jobs
 after
 they


left.
 So,
 everybody
 is
 on
 heightened


alert
 and
 everybody
 thinks
 that
 their


use
 of
 power
 is
 the
 right
 one.
 If
 I
 do


it
 this
 way,
 it's
 because
 it's
 for
 the


right
 cause.
 If
 I
 could
 jump
 in
 just
 for


a
 second,
 you
 know,
 I
 a
 lot
 of
 my
 work


chronicling
 executive
 power
 going
 back


to
 the
 Cheney
 experiences
 in
 the
 70s
 and


how
 that
 informed
 the
 Bush


administration
 and
 so
 forth


>> has
 centered
 around
 this
 idea
 that


executive
 power
 acts
 like
 a
 one-way


ratchet
 and
 that
 it's
 easier
 to
 make
 it


larger
 than
 to
 roll
 it
 back
 again


because
 whatever
 one
 guy
 does,
 the
 next


guy
 takes
 as
 a
 baseline
 and
 then


innovates
 further
 and
 then
 that
 becomes


the
 new
 baseline.


And
 I
 think
 that
 is
 a
 truth
 about
 what


we
 see
 in
 the
 growth
 of
 executive
 power,


not
 just
 under
 Trump,
 but
 under
 the


generations
 leading
 up
 to
 this
 moment.


So
 if
 Jonathan
 and
 Maggie
 are
 right
 and


there
 is
 a
 Democratic
 president
 who
 also


jettisonens
 all
 this
 caring
 about
 the


rule
 of
 law
 and
 in
 checks
 and
 balances


and
 norms
 of
 self-
 constraint
 that
 would


fit
 that
 pattern.
 When
 you
 say
 it's


appealing,
 I
 mean,
 possibly
 it's


appealing
 in
 the
 moment
 in
 the
 in
 the


crowd
 yelling
 at
 the
 rally.
 I
 think
 it's


profoundly
 unappealing
 in
 terms
 of
 a


recipe
 for
 a
 country
 that
 is
 not


literally
 go
 to
 war
 with
 itself


>> because
 it
 means
 that
 every
 if
 if


everyone
 whoever
 is
 in
 power
 is


completely
 unconstrained
 and
 there
 are


no
 checks
 and
 balances
 and
 the
 rule
 of


law
 means
 nothing
 and
 there
 are
 no


norms,
 then
 it's
 existential
 that
 that


side
 stays
 in
 power.


>> Exactly.
 and
 the
 other
 side
 comes
 in,


then
 that
 side
 thinks
 it's
 going
 to
 go


to
 prison
 because
 they
 just
 broke
 all


these
 laws.
 There
 has
 to
 be
 a
 war
 to


prevent
 the
 other
 side
 from
 coming
 in.


>> It's
 a
 government
 of
 it's
 a
 government


in
 which
 you
 have
 to
 annihilate
 your


opponents.


>> Charlie,
 when
 I
 talk
 to
 certain
 people


around
 Trump,
 that's
 where
 they
 are


psychologically
 right
 now.
 That
 the
 next


election
 is
 for
 all
 the
 marbles.
 They


cannot
 it's
 it's
 in
 it's
 intolerable
 the


thought
 of
 losing
 power
 because
 of
 that


dynamic.
 I
 agree
 with
 I'm
 not
 saying


it's
 appealing
 to
 me.
 I'm
 saying
 the
 the


idea
 of
 an
 energetic
 man
 of
 action
 in


the
 presidency
 who
 can
 click
 his
 fingers


and
 make
 things
 happen
 is
 very
 appealing


and
 I
 think
 we're
 very
 naive
 to
 think


that
 it's
 not.
 So
 just
 to
 end
 the
 first


half
 of
 this
 really
 fascinating


conversation,
 can
 we
 call
 it
 officially


a
 year
 into
 this
 second
 term
 that
 our


democracy,
 our
 democratic
 system
 has


fundamentally
 changed?
 that
 we
 can't


with
 a
 straight
 face
 say
 based
 on


everything
 you
 have
 all
 laid
 out
 here


that
 we're
 really
 talking
 about
 three


separate
 but
 equal
 branches
 of


government
 given
 the
 consolidation
 the


personalization
 and
 the
 codification
 of


power
 in
 this
 presidency
 it's
 obviously


absurd
 to
 say
 that
 we're
 looking
 at


three
 equally
 like
 look
 at
 Congress
 I


mean
 how
 could
 you
 possibly
 argue
 with
 a


straight
 face
 that
 Congress
 is
 a


separate
 co-equal
 branch
 in
 the
 way
 it's


been
 operating.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 an


absurdity.
 So,
 you
 know,
 I
 can't
 imagine


how
 you
 could
 in
 an
 intellectually


honest
 way
 make
 that
 case.


>> And
 if
 we're
 going to
 ratchet
 it
 up,


Charlie,
 if
 it
 only
 goes
 in
 one


direction,
 doesn't
 that
 mean
 something


fundamental
 has
 changed
 here
 in
 the


American
 system
 of
 democracy?


>> It's
 hard
 to
 say
 that
 this
 is
 like
 a


permanent
 entrenchment
 of
 what
 we
 saw
 in


the
 year
 2025
 is
 the
 way
 it's
 always


going
 to
 be
 going
 forward.
 Now
 I
 think


certainly
 though
 the
 American
 style


system
 of
 democracy
 and
 checks
 and


balances
 and
 separated
 institutions


wielding
 co-equal
 control
 over
 the


government
 is
 not
 how
 America
 has


functioned
 in
 the
 first
 year
 of
 the


Trump
 second
 term.


And
 you
 know
 the
 whole
 system
 is
 very


sick
 right
 now.


Well,
 when
 we
 [music]
 come
 back,
 we're


going
 to
 talk
 about
 how
 much
 of
 this


first
 term
 and
 the
 president's
 use
 of


power,
 to
 my
 surprise,
 [music]


wonder
 if
 it's
 to
 yours
 as
 well,
 ended


up
 happening
 overseas.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Charlie
 and
 Maggie
 and
 Jonathan,
 as
 I


said
 before
 the
 break,
 one
 of
 the
 most


surprising
 qualities
 of
 this
 first
 year


of
 his
 second
 term
 has
 been
 the
 way
 that


the
 president
 has
 used
 this
 consolidated


power
 overseas.
 And
 let
 me
 just
 offer
 a


few
 reminders
 that
 you
 may
 not
 even


need.
 He
 has
 deployed
 US
 bombers
 to
 take


out
 Iran's
 nuclear
 facilities.
 He
 has


intervened
 in
 the
 war
 between
 Israel
 and


Gaza
 and
 successfully
 pushed
 for
 a
 peace


deal
 that
 released
 the
 hostages
 there.


He
 has
 tried
 to
 negotiate
 peace
 between


Russia
 and
 Ukraine.
 He
 has
 used
 special


forces
 to
 take
 out
 Nicholas
 Maduro.
 He


has
 threatened
 to
 take
 over
 Greenland.


This
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 emphasis
 not
 on


America.
 I
 think
 the
 problem
 with
 the


list
 you
 just
 laid
 out,
 Michael,
 is
 that


it
 contains
 very
 conventional


expressions
 of,
 you
 know,
 presidential


power
 in
 an
 area
 where
 there
 is
 a
 lot
 of


leeway,
 you
 know,
 in
 terms
 of
 the


ability
 to
 conduct
 foreign
 policy.
 So,


it
 is
 completely
 conventional
 for
 a


president
 to
 try
 to
 negotiate
 the
 end
 to


a
 war
 in
 any
 part
 of
 the
 world.
 where
 we


get
 into
 really,
 to
 use
 the
 word
 again,


extravagant
 uses
 of
 power
 is
 in
 the


areas
 that
 Charlie
 has
 been
 reporting
 on


so
 much,
 which
 is
 declaring
 just
 because


Donald
 Trump
 says
 so
 that
 people
 who
 are


transporting
 cocaine
 on
 boats
 are
 armed


combatants
 and
 terrorists
 and
 therefore


I
 won't
 arrest
 them,
 I
 will
 just
 blow


them
 up
 and
 kill
 them.
 or
 you
 know


sending
 Delta
 Force
 in
 to
 remove
 a


foreign
 sovereign.
 Those
 are
 the
 areas


where
 he's
 really
 testing
 things
 in
 a


lot
 of
 the
 other
 areas
 that
 you


mentioned.
 I
 think
 it's
 quite


conventional
 the
 way
 that
 he's
 using


power.


>> That's
 very
 helpful
 that
 distinction.
 I


mean,
 Charlie,
 since
 Jonathan
 brings
 it


up
 and
 dismisses
 much
 of
 my
 list
 as


conventional,
 but
 zeros
 in,


>> I
 would
 throw
 bombing
 Iran
 into
 the
 list


of
 things
 that
 are
 across
 the
 line,
 but


certainly
 negotiating
 peace
 deals
 is


not.


>> And
 when
 you
 say
 cross
 the
 line,


describe
 what
 you
 mean
 and
 why
 it


matters
 because
 presidents
 of
 the
 United


States
 have
 always,
 as
 Jonathan
 has


said,
 exercised
 an
 extraordinary
 amount


of
 discretion
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 use


of
 the
 US
 military.
 Well,
 presidents
 of


both
 parties
 going
 back
 have
 carved
 out


for
 themselves
 an
 ability
 to
 use


American
 military
 force
 abroad


unilaterally
 without
 going
 to
 Congress


under
 certain
 circumstances.
 The


circumstances
 are
 basically
 incidences


where
 there's
 a
 national
 interest
 in
 the


anticipated
 scope,
 duration,
 nature
 of


the
 hostilities
 fall
 short
 of
 war
 in
 the


constitutional
 sense.
 So,
 one-off
 air


strikes,
 peacekeeping
 operations,


small-cale
 interventions,


Bombing
 Iran
 was
 seen
 as
 across
 the
 line


because
 it
 created
 such
 a
 risk
 of
 a


major
 regional
 conflration
 that
 the


anticipated
 risk
 that
 it
 could
 lead
 to
 a


full-scale
 war
 meant
 Congress
 needed
 to


be
 involved
 from
 the
 beginning
 if
 we


were
 going
 to
 cross
 that
 line.


>> The
 boat
 strikes
 and
 the
 Venezuela


Maduro
 operation
 certainly
 in
 that


category.
 Trump
 is
 assuming
 for
 himself


the
 power
 to
 essentially
 order
 the


summary
 extrajudicial
 executions
 of


people
 who
 had
 always
 been
 treated
 as


criminal
 suspects
 and
 the
 crime
 they
 are


suspected
 of
 committing
 not
 even
 a


capital
 offense
 that
 is
 drug


trafficking.


>> Mhm.


>> He's
 done
 so
 through
 a
 sort
 of
 conjuring


into
 existence
 legal
 realities,
 you


know,
 realities
 in
 quotation
 marks.
 I


determine
 that
 there
 is
 an
 legal
 formal


state
 of
 armed
 conflict
 with
 a
 secret


list
 of
 drug
 cartels
 and
 criminal
 gangs


and
 that
 therefore
 the
 people
 on
 boats


suspected
 of
 smuggling
 narcotics
 for


them
 are
 not
 criminals.
 They
 are


combatants
 and
 therefore
 it
 is
 lawful


for
 me
 to
 direct
 the
 US
 military
 to
 kill


them
 summarily.
 I
 mean
 that's
 an


extraordinary
 thing.
 No
 one
 thinks
 that


outside
 of
 the
 government
 that
 there
 is


actually
 an
 armed
 conflict,
 but
 who's


going
 to
 challenge
 him
 inside
 the


government?
 Clearly,
 the
 military
 is


not,
 especially
 because
 their
 Jag
 core


has
 been
 gutted
 by
 Secretary
 of
 Defense


Pete
 Hex.


>> Jagore
 are
 the
 lawyers
 in
 the
 military


who
 might
 issue
 opinions
 saying
 don't
 do


that.
 whose
 purpose
 is
 to
 provide
 legal


advice
 to
 military
 commanders
 about


obeying
 the
 law.
 And
 the
 law
 says


militaries
 are
 not
 allowed
 to
 target


civilians
 even
 if
 they
 are
 suspected
 of


crimes
 if
 they
 pose
 no
 imminent
 threat.


That
 is
 murder
 and
 peace
 time.
 That
 is
 a


war
 crime
 in
 an
 armed
 conflict.


Nevertheless,
 the
 military
 is
 doing
 what


Trump
 is
 telling
 them
 to
 do.
 And
 now


with
 the
 raid
 into
 Venezuela,


using
 ground
 troops
 on
 the
 sovereign


soil
 of
 another
 country
 in
 a
 place
 where


they
 killed
 80
 people
 and
 affectuated


regime
 change.


And
 he
 says
 he
 can
 do
 that
 too
 in
 this


case
 under
 the
 guise
 of
 being
 a
 law


enforcement
 operation.
 So
 they
 can


combat
 drug
 smugglers
 by
 saying
 that's


not
 a
 law
 enforcement
 investigation,


that's
 war.
 and
 then
 they
 can
 send


troops
 in
 to
 the
 foreign
 territory
 of


another
 country
 without
 congressional


authorization
 by
 saying
 that's
 not
 war,


that
 is
 just
 a
 law
 enforcement


operation.
 It's
 just
 an
 extraordinary


set
 of
 events.
 It
 is
 a
 demonstration
 of


the
 theme
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 in
 the


first
 half
 of
 this
 of
 you
 can
 just
 do


stuff
 and
 especially
 if
 you've
 hired
 the


right
 lawyers
 who
 are
 not
 going
 to
 raise


objections
 but
 are
 going
 to
 find
 ways
 to


produce
 a
 piece
 of
 paper
 with
 some
 words


on
 it
 that
 says
 yes
 you
 can
 do
 what
 you


want
 to
 do
 who's
 going
 to
 stop
 you


>> Jonathan
 what
 may
 unify
 these


interventions
 if
 anything
 and
 I'm
 going


to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 provocative
 here
 is


that
 for
 now
 they
 have
 seemed
 to
 turn


out
 pretty
 well
 for
 the
 United
 States.


And
 let
 me
 just
 give
 you
 some
 examples.


When
 we
 think
 about
 the
 president's


approach
 to
 foreign
 affairs
 this
 entire


past
 year,
 it
 ends
 with
 a
 NATO
 that's


paying
 more
 than
 ever
 for
 its
 own


defense,
 which
 therefore
 puts
 less


burden
 on
 the
 US
 Treasury.
 The
 United


States
 is
 now
 feared
 by
 Latin
 American


leaders
 who
 have
 major
 problems
 with


drug
 cartels.
 And
 we're
 seeing
 that


those
 governments,
 look
 at
 Mexico
 for


example,
 it
 turns
 out,
 can
 do
 a
 heck
 of


a
 lot
 more
 to
 fight
 those
 cartels
 when


they
 feel
 threatened
 by
 Donald
 Trump.
 So


just
 reckon
 with
 that
 for
 a
 minute
 that


as
 legally
 dubious
 as
 some
 of
 these


actions
 have
 been,
 they
 do
 appear
 to


serve
 the
 US
 national
 interest.
 Well,
 I


don't
 find
 this
 difficult
 to
 reckon
 with


at
 all.
 And
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 point
 I


was
 getting
 at
 earlier,
 which
 is
 that


just
 because
 something
 is
 unlawful
 or
 at


least
 legally
 contested
 doesn't
 mean


that
 it's
 not
 appealing
 or
 doesn't
 get


some
 good
 for
 America.
 So
 the
 two
 major


military
 operations
 that
 he
 has


authorized
 in
 Iran
 and
 in
 Venezuela


resulted
 in
 no
 American
 service
 members


dying.
 I
 mean,
 whatever
 you
 think
 about


the
 operation
 to
 get
 rid
 of
 Maduro,


whether
 you
 think
 it
 was
 wise,
 it
 was
 an


astonishing
 display
 of
 military
 prowess.


And
 if
 you're
 Donald
 Trump
 and
 you
 pull


off
 such
 spectacular


military
 successes
 and
 then
 get
 the


reinforcement
 of
 the
 praise
 and
 the


fear,


>> it's
 self-reinforcing.
 And
 that's
 why


you
 see
 him
 now
 saying,
 "Well,
 what


about
 Greenland?
 What
 about
 Cuba?
 What


about
 a
 regime
 change
 in
 Iran?
 Is
 he


just
 going
 to
 continue
 to
 get
 lucky
 in


all
 these
 circumstances?
 We
 don't
 know.


We're
 still
 very
 early
 in
 the


presidency.
 But
 what
 I
 would
 say
 to
 your


point
 about,
 you
 know,
 looking
 at
 this


holistically,
 it's
 true
 that
 the


Europeans
 are
 now
 spending
 more
 on
 their


defense.
 Donald
 Trump
 has
 managed
 to
 get


them
 to
 do
 something
 that
 other


presidents
 have
 not,
 and
 he
 should
 be


credited
 for
 that.
 But
 what's
 also
 true,


if
 you're
 looking
 at
 this
 with
 cold,


clear
 eyes,
 is
 that
 America's


traditional
 allies
 will
 not
 go
 back
 to


the
 way
 they
 were
 in
 terms
 of
 trusting


America
 and
 the
 nature
 of
 those


alliances
 that
 predated
 at
 least
 the


second
 Trump
 presidency
 because
 they
 can


always
 know
 that
 America
 could
 go
 back


to
 this
 point.
 Even
 if
 we
 do
 get
 some


restorationist
 type
 figure
 who's
 saying


NATO's,
 you
 know,
 everyone
 needs
 to
 hold


hands,
 they've
 now
 had
 this
 lived


experience
 of
 an
 American
 president
 that


says
 we're
 going
 to
 take
 this
 territory


and,
 you
 know,
 to
 hell
 with
 you.
 You're


just
 going
 to
 have
 to
 live
 with
 it.
 So,


it's
 very
 hard
 to
 make
 long-term


assessments
 about
 the
 American
 national


interest
 right
 now,
 a
 year
 into
 the


Donald
 Trump
 presidency.
 There
 are
 going


to
 be
 areas
 where
 Donald
 Trump's


approach
 to
 power
 extracts
 positive


things
 for
 America.
 There
 are
 also
 going


to
 potentially
 be
 costs


>> and
 maybe
 even
 very
 significant
 costs
 to


the
 way
 that
 he's
 acting
 on
 the
 global


stage.
 Maggie,
 to
 bring
 it
 back
 to
 the


domestic
 front
 for
 a
 moment,
 one
 of
 the


riddles
 of
 the
 second
 term
 is
 that
 this


is
 a
 president,
 and
 I
 looking
 at
 you


because
 you
 literally
 wrote
 a
 biography


of
 him,
 who
 deeply
 craves
 approval
 and


affirmation.
 [clears throat]


And
 yet
 polling
 shows
 that
 voters


approval
 of
 him
 on
 a
 wide
 variety
 of
 key


issues
 from
 the
 economy
 to
 immigration


to
 some
 of
 his
 overseas
 interventions


has
 been
 on
 the
 decline
 throughout
 this


first
 year
 of
 his
 second
 term.
 And
 the


question
 to
 me
 anyway
 is
 why
 is
 this


second
 term
 being
 defined
 by
 a


disconnect


on
 what's
 important
 to
 him
 and
 what's


important
 to
 the
 voters
 who
 put
 him
 into


this
 office,
 especially
 for
 someone
 who


has
 been
 defined
 by
 the
 desire
 for


affirmation.


>> Sure.
 This
 has
 come
 up
 a
 lot.
 I
 mean,


the
 simple
 answer,
 and
 we
 hear
 this
 from


multiple
 people
 close
 to
 the
 president,


is
 he
 just
 sort
 of
 doesn't
 care
 the
 same


way.
 I
 mean,
 he
 is
 just
 going
 to
 do
 what


he
 wants.
 We
 talked
 about
 the


reparations
 era
 of
 Donald
 Trump,
 not


just
 for
 self,
 but
 just
 sort
 of
 for


life,
 for
 everything.
 You
 know,
 he
 felt


like
 he
 didn't
 get
 to
 enjoy
 his


presidency
 the
 first
 time
 because
 of
 the


Russia
 investigation
 and
 impeachments


and
 so
 forth
 and
 so
 on.
 And
 now
 he
 feels


like
 he
 is
 just
 going
 to
 do
 what
 he


wants.
 And
 he
 is
 not
 on
 the
 ballot
 again


himself.
 And
 so
 unless
 there
 is
 a
 direct


impact
 to
 him,
 he
 doesn't
 care.
 And
 yes,


he's
 not
 getting
 the
 media
 coverage
 that


he
 wants.
 That
 is
 true,
 at least
 in
 the


mainstream
 media.
 But
 he
 is
 getting
 a


lot
 of
 lavish
 praise
 from
 quarters
 like


Fox
 News,
 which
 actually
 wasn't
 this


all-in
 for
 him
 in
 term
 one.
 He
 has


business
 leaders
 sort
 of
 tripping
 over


themselves.
 Um,
 and
 he's
 being
 to
 praise


him
 and
 to
 give
 him
 money
 and
 to
 tell


him
 everything
 he's
 doing
 is
 fantastic.


And
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 I
 did
 want
 to
 say


about
 foreign
 policy
 that's
 the
 through


line
 with
 him.
 He's
 never
 been
 as


engaged
 on
 domestic
 policy
 as
 he
 has


been
 captivated
 by
 being
 seen
 as
 a


player
 on
 the
 global
 stage
 going
 back
 40


years.
 I
 mean
 if
 you
 go
 back
 and
 you


look
 at
 everything
 he
 was
 doing
 in
 the


80s
 it
 was
 trying
 to
 be
 seen
 as
 an


expert
 on
 nuclear
 physics
 [laughter]
 or


somebody
 who
 you
 know
 might
 be
 able
 to


get
 Reagan's
 ear
 or
 somebody
 who
 could


meet
 with
 Gorbachev
 and
 so
 he's
 now


being
 recognized
 that
 way.
 fascinating


>> and
 he
 is
 living
 in
 a
 very
 very
 isolated


information
 bubble
 and
 it
 doesn't
 seem


to
 bother
 him
 at
 all.
 If
 it
 starts
 to,


we'll
 see.
 But
 he's
 content
 that
 he's


getting
 all
 the
 praise
 he
 needs.
 M
 I


mean
 Jonathan
 it
 just
 feels
 like
 and


this
 is
 what's
 useful
 about
 pausing
 at
 a


year
 mark
 and
 having
 this
 conversation


is
 that
 if
 MAGAism
 Trumpism
 was
 always
 a


transaction
 between
 the
 president
 and


the
 electorate
 it
 feels
 like
 his
 place


in
 this
 transaction
 is
 kind
 of
 over.
 Oh,


I
 see
 it
 so
 differently.
 I
 I
 don't
 think


it's
 a
 transaction
 at
 all.
 I
 think


Donald
 Trump
 is
 a,
 you
 know,
 we
 misuse


the
 word
 charisma,
 but
 actual
 charisma


historically
 understood,
 the
 ability
 to


have
 an
 emotional
 connection
 with


someone.
 That's
 the
 heart
 of
 the
 Donald


Trump
 movement.
 And
 to
 me,
 the
 big


question
 is
 when
 Donald
 Trump
 leaves
 the


scene
 and
 a
 more
 conventional
 politician


comes
 in,
 and
 let's
 face
 it,
 every
 one


of
 the
 people
 that
 we're
 discussing
 as


potential
 successes
 to
 him
 from
 JD
 Vance


on
 down
 are
 not
 Donald
 Trump
 on
 this.


Can
 that
 person
 glue
 together
 this


impossible
 coalition
 which
 includes


Lindsey
 Graham
 and
 Tucker
 Carlson?


People
 who
 despise
 each
 other,


[laughter]
 who
 diametrically
 opposed
 on


key
 issues,
 Donald
 Trump
 glues
 them


together
 through
 an
 almost
 sort
 of


supernatural,
 whatever
 you
 want
 to
 call


it,
 but
 like
 can
 a
 more
 conventional


politician
 glue
 together
 that
 coalition?


Like
 I'm
 very
 skeptical.
 So
 the
 more


that
 voters
 view
 Donald
 Trump
 as,
 "Yeah,


I
 I
 still
 kind
 of
 like
 him
 at
 some
 gut


level,
 but
 he's
 disappointed
 me
 on
 issue


X,
 issue
 Y,
 issue
 Z."
 The
 victim
 or
 the


person
 who
 bears
 the
 costs
 of
 that
 is


less
 likely
 to
 be
 Donald
 Trump
 than
 it


is
 to
 be
 JD
 Vance
 or
 whoever
 succeeds


him.
 Well,
 we
 have
 three
 more
 years
 to


figure
 out
 who
 will
 emerge
 as
 the


political
 heir
 to
 Donald
 Trump,


Jonathan.
 So,
 let's
 table
 that
 for
 the


moment.
 I
 want
 to
 ask
 the
 three
 of
 you
 a


bit
 of
 a
 curveball.
 I'm
 curious
 what


specific
 moment
 of
 this
 past
 year
 stands


out
 to
 you.
 Not
 necessarily
 in
 the


classic
 it
 was
 the
 most
 important
 moment


sense,
 but
 because
 for
 you
 it
 was
 the


most
 revealing
 and
 embodying
 of
 this


second
 term
 so
 far.
 For
 me,
 it
 really


was
 about
 the
 initial
 handling
 in
 the


summer
 of
 the
 Jeffrey
 Epstein
 files,


documents,
 material,
 whatever
 you
 want


to
 call
 it.
 Why?


>> This
 is
 another
 example
 of
 Trump


personalizing
 his
 presidency
 in
 the


sense
 that
 for
 him,
 he
 was
 never
 that


obsessed
 with
 the
 Jeffrey
 Epstein


matter.
 I
 mean,
 he
 did
 talk
 about
 it
 in


2015
 in
 the
 context
 of
 Bill
 Clinton
 and


so
 forth,
 but
 he
 was
 never
 somebody
 who


made
 this
 his
 lifeblood.
 whereas
 it
 has


been
 a
 driving
 force
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 his


supporters.
 And
 there
 was
 just
 this


fundamental
 disconnect
 between
 himself


and
 aspects
 of
 his
 base
 on
 this.
 And


this
 was
 the
 first
 time,
 at least
 for


me,
 that
 we
 really
 saw
 that.


>> Charlie,


>> well,
 I
 spent
 so
 much
 time
 writing
 about


Venezuela
 and
 the
 boat
 strikes.
 I'll


I'll
 pick
 in
 September
 when
 he's
 got


some
 people
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office
 for
 a


completely
 unrelated
 issue
 and
 he


suddenly
 just
 kind
 of
 casually
 remarks,


"By
 the
 way,
 we
 blew
 some
 people
 out
 of


the
 water
 this
 morning.
 You're
 going
 to


be
 hearing
 more
 about
 that."
 and
 then
 a


few
 minutes
 later
 posts
 on
 his
 truth


social
 social
 media
 platform


>> what
 any
 administration
 would
 treat
 as


highly
 classified
 footage
 of
 this
 attack


>> and
 using
 this
 entirely
 personalized


medium
 truthocial.com


to
 put
 out
 this
 extremely
 official


important
 footage
 was
 striking.
 No
 other


president
 would
 have
 done
 that
 at
 all


but
 certainly
 no
 other
 president
 would


have
 done
 it
 the
 public
 presentation
 of


it
 in
 that
 way.
 Jonathan,
 what
 about


you?


[sighs]


>> There
 are
 sort
 of
 two
 moments.
 I
 know


that's
 not
 the
 rule,
 but
 um
 [laughter]


Oh,


>> I
 didn't
 know
 we
 could
 do
 that.
 I
 would


have
 done
 that.


>> The
 first


>> You're
 violating
 norms.


>> Exactly.
 Norms,
 not
 laws.


>> They're
 both
 images
 actually.
 Video.
 The


first
 was
 the
 tech
 billionaires
 on
 the


dis
 at
 the
 inauguration.
 Because
 if
 we


accept
 that
 AI
 is
 potentially
 as


transformative,
 if
 not
 more


transformative
 than
 the
 great


breakthroughs
 of
 the
 last
 century,


Donald
 Trump
 has
 taken
 America
 in
 a
 very


different
 direction
 in
 terms
 of


unleashing
 AI,
 giving
 these
 guys


basically
 everything
 they
 want.
 If
 you


think
 about
 what
 are
 the
 things
 that
 he


does
 that
 are
 going
 to
 outlast
 him,


that's
 going
 to
 be
 one
 of
 them.


>> This
 could
 be
 the
 most
 lastingly


transformational.


>> It
 could.
 Besides
 the
 the
 way
 he's


changed
 the
 presidency,
 the
 other
 one
 is


the
 assassination
 of
 Charlie
 Kirk.
 It


was


>> a
 horrifying
 moment.
 I
 can't
 get
 that


video
 out
 of
 my
 head.
 I
 talked
 to


Charlie
 Kirk
 the
 day
 before


>> he
 was
 assassinated.
 You
 know,
 someone


that
 I
 dealt
 with
 a
 lot.
 While
 Charlie's


death
 was
 a
 horrible
 tragedy,
 it
 was


also
 an
 opportunity
 for
 the
 Trump


administration
 to
 do
 what
 many
 of
 them


have
 wanted
 to
 do,
 including
 Donald


Trump,
 which
 is
 use
 government
 power
 to


crush
 the
 left,
 to
 dismantle
 the
 left,


to
 go
 after
 the
 institutional
 left,
 the


major
 groups
 on
 the
 left.
 If
 we
 do
 see


in
 the
 next
 12
 months
 efforts
 by
 the


Justice
 Department
 to
 dismantle,


prosecute
 the
 left's
 big
 groups,
 this


horrible
 assassination
 could
 be
 a
 real


catalyst
 of
 that
 story.


I
 want
 to
 end
 this
 conversation
 by


asking
 the
 three
 of
 you
 to
 briefly
 look


ahead
 [clears throat]
 to
 the
 rest
 of
 the


term
 and
 what
 is
 left
 for
 him
 to
 do


after
 doing
 so
 much
 in
 these
 past
 365
 or


so
 days.
 What's
 actually
 left
 for
 him
 to


do
 after
 everything
 he
 has
 done?
 Maggie.


>> Well,
 let's
 just
 take
 his
 revenge
 tour


specifically
 in
 the
 form
 of
 prosecutions


he
 wants
 to
 see.
 He
 has
 gotten


frustrated
 that
 courts
 have
 styied
 him,


that
 the
 Justice
 Department
 at
 times
 has


stymied
 him,
 that
 career
 prosecutors


have
 quit
 and
 said
 that
 they're
 not


going
 to
 go
 ahead
 with
 things.
 It


reminds
 me
 very
 much,
 frankly,
 of
 the


leadup
 to,
 you
 know,
 January
 6,
 2021,


when
 he
 was
 looking
 for
 anyone
 who
 would


give
 him
 what
 he
 wanted.
 He
 always


likes,
 as
 one
 of
 his
 friends
 said
 to
 me,


lawyers
 who
 will
 do
 anything.
 The


reality
 is
 he
 really
 likes
 fill-in-lank


who
 will
 do
 anything,
 you
 know,
 if
 he


asks
 them
 to.
 And
 so
 no
 one
 has
 been


convicted,
 no
 one
 has
 been
 put
 in
 jail.


And
 so
 far,


>> so
 that
 work
 is
 unfinished


>> for
 him.


>> Yes.
 And
 he
 has
 made
 quite
 clear
 vocally


to
 people
 around
 him
 that
 that
 work
 is


unfinished.


>> Mhm.
 Jonathan,


>> Donald
 Trump,
 I'm
 not
 saying
 he
 has
 a


fully
 developed
 framework
 for
 this,
 but


I
 think
 at
 an
 instinctive
 level,
 he's


quite
 sympathetic
 to
 the
 notion
 of


dividing
 the
 world
 up
 into
 spheres
 of


influence.


Meaning
 America
 is
 the
 hegeimon
 in
 the


western
 hemisphere
 and
 America
 has


complete
 domination
 over
 its
 own


neighborhood.
 You
 know,
 Venezuela
 is
 the


51st
 state,
 Canada
 is
 the
 52nd
 state,


you
 know,
 go
 down
 the
 list.
 But
 that


potentially
 also
 leaves
 room
 for
 China


to
 take
 Taiwan,
 for
 Russia
 to
 obviously


they
 are
 going
 to
 get
 a
 large
 amount
 of


land
 out
 of
 whatever
 final
 arrangement


happens
 in
 in
 this
 war.
 It'll
 be


interesting
 to
 see
 how
 that
 evolves
 and


obviously
 the
 center
 of
 that


conversation
 is
 Donald
 Trump's


relationship
 with
 Xiinping
 and
 Vladimir


Putin
 and
 what
 concessions
 he
 makes
 to


them,
 how
 much
 room
 he
 gives
 them
 to


exert
 their
 own
 domination
 over
 their


neighborhoods.


>> Okay.
 So,
 putting
 enemies
 behind
 bars,


reorganizing
 the
 entire
 global
 order.


Charlie,
 do
 you
 have
 anything
 to
 add
 to


what
 you
 think
 might
 happen
 here?
 To
 add


one
 more
 thing
 to
 the
 table,
 I
 would


point
 to
 immigration
 enforcement
 as
 an


unfinished
 business
 that
 is
 already


becoming
 escalatory.
 Trump
 very
 quickly


managed
 to
 close
 the
 border.
 But
 what


has
 marked
 both
 his
 promises
 and
 what


his
 base
 elected
 him
 to
 do
 and
 what
 he's


now
 doing
 as
 aggressively
 as
 he
 can
 is


the
 interior
 enforcement.
 Mass
 sweeps


aimed
 at
 purging
 the
 country
 of
 many


millions
 of
 people
 who
 are
 here
 without


documentation.
 as
 we
 are
 seeing
 in


places
 right
 now
 like
 Minneapolis.


>> But
 the
 bottom
 line
 is
 there
 are


millions
 of
 people
 here
 that
 people
 like


Steven
 Miller
 do
 not
 want
 to
 be
 here
 and


finding
 them
 and
 taking
 them
 into


custody
 and
 pushing
 them
 through
 the


deportation
 hearing
 process
 in
 a
 way


that
 dramatically
 escalates
 the
 number


of
 people
 per
 year
 who
 are
 removed
 from


the
 country
 is
 a
 achievement
 that
 it


remains
 promised
 and
 yet
 undone.
 So
 what


all
 this
 seems
 to
 add
 up
 to
 is
 an


increased
 amount
 of
 tensions
 at
 home
 and


the
 use
 and
 the
 willingness
 to
 use
 hard


power
 in
 the
 streets
 of
 American
 cities,


especially
 Democratic
 cities,
 both
 ICE


agents
 in
 masks,
 acting
 very


aggressively
 and
 then
 backed
 by
 the


threat
 of
 and
 sometimes
 the
 reality
 of


federal
 troops
 in
 the
 streets
 of


American
 cities
 to
 protect
 and
 enhance


that
 effort.
 It
 seems
 very
 incendiary,


>> right?
 [music]


Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 as
 we
 sit
 here
 right
 now,


it
 really
 does
 feel
 like
 the
 country
 is


on
 edge.
 We're
 in
 this
 very
 precarious


moment
 where
 you've
 got
 Donald
 Trump's


assertion
 of
 power
 using
 the
 military,


using
 ICE
 in
 cities
 in
 a
 very


in-your-face
 way
 and
 a
 resistance


movement
 that
 is
 building
 up
 steam
 on


the
 left.
 And
 it
 just
 seems
 like
 that


collision
 is
 inevitable
 in
 a
 way
 that
 is


much
 more
 dramatic
 than
 we've
 seen
 so


far.


Well,
 Jonathan,
 Charlie,
 [music]
 Maggie,


thank
 you
 very
 much
 once
 again.


Appreciate
 it.


>> Thank
 you,
 [music]
 Michael.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thanks,
 Michael.


>> [music]


>> Over
 the
 weekend,
 President
 Trump
 once


again
 used
 his
 power
 in
 previously


unimaginable
 ways.
 His
 justice


department
 opened
 a
 criminal


investigation
 into
 Minnesota's


Democratic
 leaders,
 including
 the


state's
 governor,
 Tim
 Walls,
 and
 the


mayor
 of
 Minneapolis,
 Jacob
 Fry.
 Both
 of


whom
 have
 criticized
 Trump's
 immigration


crackdown
 in
 the
 state.
 The


investigation
 will
 focus
 on
 allegations


that
 both
 officials
 conspired
 to
 block


federal
 immigration
 officials
 from
 doing


their
 job.
 In
 a
 statement,
 Governor


Walls
 called
 the
 investigation
 a
 quote


dangerous
 authoritarian
 tactic.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's


[music]


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.
 Over


the
 weekend,
 President
 Trump
 threatened


in
 a
 social
 media
 post
 to
 slap
 major
 new


tariffs
 on
 European
 countries
 [music]


that
 oppose
 his
 plan
 to
 acquire


Greenland.


That
 drew
 outrage
 from
 European
 leaders


who
 said
 the
 threats
 amounted
 to
 [music]


economic
 warfare
 against
 longtime


allies.
 But
 Trump
 showed
 little
 sign
 of


backing
 down.
 On
 Sunday,
 in
 a
 moment
 of


bracing
 cander,
 Trump
 told
 the
 leader
 of


Norway
 that
 he
 no
 longer
 felt
 any


obligation
 to
 pursue
 a
 peaceful
 takeover


of
 Greenland
 because
 he
 said
 he
 [music]


was
 upset
 about
 not
 winning
 the
 Nobel


Peace
 Prize.


[music]
 and
 Spanish
 officials
 are


investigating
 the
 cause
 of
 a
 high-speed


train
 [music]
 crash
 that
 killed
 at
 least


40
 people.
 It
 was
 Spain's
 deadliest


railroad
 accident
 in
 more
 [music]
 than
 a


decade.
 The
 crash
 occurred
 when
 the
 two


rear
 cars
 of
 one
 train
 derailed
 and


crossed
 into
 the
 path
 of
 another
 train.


The
 [music]
 resulting
 collision
 hurled


some
 passengers
 hundreds
 of
 feet
 from


the
 train.
