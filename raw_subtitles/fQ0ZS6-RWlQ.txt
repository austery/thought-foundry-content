- The big question, really,
when I think about trauma
is how do most people
respond to the things
that we think of as traumas?
I tend to use the word potential trauma
or potentially traumatic event.
And that's because
events are not traumatic,
they're potentially traumatic,
but how do most people respond?
We know that some people get PTSD,
but what do most people,
how do most people react?
And when we can see that,
then why is it that
people react certain ways?
This is the question really
that's occupied my career.
My name is George Bonanno.
I'm a professor of clinical psychology
at Columbia University.
My most recent book is titled
"The End of Trauma: How the
New Science of Resilience
"is Changing How We Think About PTSD."
I'm known for identifying
and documenting human resilience
in the face of, basically,
the worst things
that happen to people
- Overcoming trauma with George Bonanno.
Chapter one: the Human
Capacity for Resilience.
- It's difficult for
me to identify one myth
that I'd like to debunk
'cause I'd like to debunk a bunch of them.
There are at least three
very much interrelated
misconceptions about trauma right now.
One is that anything very
difficult and unpleasant,
hard, can cause trauma or is a trauma.
Another is that anything
that we consider a trauma
has lasting emotional damage.
And the third, which is very pernicious,
is that there are hidden traumas
that we're carrying
around PTSD like traumas
in us somewhere, and
they're hidden from us,
yet they are continuing to harm us
and to cause difficulties in our life.
Even saying that, I have to confess,
even saying that makes me feel funny
because as a scientist, when you say,
"we carrying around
with us hidden traumas,"
I want to say, "where are they?"
Because we don't have mechanisms
for those things in our bodies.
We have for a long time; we
tend to essentialize trauma.
We think that trauma exists in nature.
PTSD exists in nature.
We didn't think it up.
We discovered it. That's
the way it's viewed.
And by the same token,
resilience exists in
nature and we discover it.
So these things just are,
and people therefore are
either going to be traumatized
or they're going to be resilient just
because of who they are.
None of that is actually true or accurate,
but it leads to a kind of an absence
of inquiry into what's really going on.
Why is it that some people develop PTSD?
Why is it other people don't?
And that's really the
question we have to get at.
I began studying these
phenomena around 1991,
and at that time, resilience was known.
It was largely seen in children faced
with really caustic environments,
children going up with,
you know, chronic abuse and poverty
or people in Civil War.
Things were really draining,
demanding caustic environments.
When it came to potentially
traumatic events,
the assumption was that
that's just too much.
That's overwhelming
because they're so acute,
so intense, so focused
that very few people
can deal with that.
The same was actually thought about loss,
about grief as well.
So when in our research we began to
identify and show that, look,
people are actually
resilient to these events.
A lot of people are. Most people are.
It was met initially with not
really much of a rebuttal,
more of indifference.
I was young, I was a new investigator,
I was using some different
methods that had been used,
and the assumption was, I
must be doing something wrong.
Either that or I'm, you
know, this can't be true.
And initially a lot of people
on the more clinical end
of things would tell me,
that's just plain wrong.
I don't know what you're doing.
You're probably a good researcher,
but that's just not true.
And that kind of lack of the reason,
it wasn't so much pushback
as much as simply just ignoring the idea.
And when I first began
to publish these papers,
I published these papers
with my colleagues.
My colleagues didn't want me
to use the word resilience
because that seemed too
provocative to use that word.
I left home when I was
17, and I left a fairly,
for lack of a better word: unsavory home.
It was a violent home.
And I left, I sat out on
my own at 17 with no money,
nobody in my corner.
Around the age of 19,
I had made my way to Arizona
and I had a part-time job.
At the time, I didn't seem
to need a lot of money,
and I hitchhiked to Central Arizona
where there's a lot of Indian reservation,
Native American lands.
And I reached the Salt
River Canyon at dusk.
I decided to walk in and camp.
I saw that there was a river
going through the Salt River.
There was a sign that basically said,
if I can translate this,
this is Apache Reservation Land.
If you go in this canyon,
you're on your own, basically.
No one's gonna come get you.
There aren't many of us here.
Something like that.
It was a long time ago, 50 years ago.
So I'm paraphrasing.
There were a number of warning signs
of flash floods that I was,
I just simply did not pick up on those.
I was young, I didn't know
that much about the desert.
I hiked into the canyon aways
until the trail disappeared,
climbed up to a ledge about
10, 15 feet above the water,
pitched my tent and went to sleep.
So in the middle of the
night, it began to rain,
and I heard the water running by.
I thought this may be damaging my tent,
so I pulled up the rain
flight, stuck up my flashlight,
and the river had risen
to where my tent was
and was rushing by, it'd
risen about 10, 15 feet.
I panicked.
Got up quickly, it was raining now,
pulled my tent out as fast as I could,
gathered it up, looked around me.
And there's this now
river that's much wider
than it was before,
running by me quite fast.
Lapping at the very spot where I was.
I was panicking, I was focusing
my thoughts as best I could.
I climbed up about another
15 feet to a very tiny ledge
and got myself there.
Eventually, my dog made his way up.
I was very happy about that.
I didn't know the river
would take my ledge
with me as it withered away to canyon.
And I sat perched on that
ledge for a long time,
wondering what was going to happen to me.
I was running in my mind
all the realization that
where I was sleeping is now underwater.
Had I not woken when I did,
I would've been swept away
essentially in a big plastic,
big nylon bag that was my tent,
and I would've surely drowned
the most horrific death.
It wasn't until years
later when I began to study
people coping with trauma and loss,
and I began to see how
resilient people were.
And at first I thought,
why have I not gone
through anything like this?
All these people go through
these horrific events,
why have I not gone through
one of these events?
And then I began to remember,
I remembered that event
and I remembered all these other events,
many other events that I'd gone through
that would qualify as
traumas or potential traumas
that were just simply poignant,
disturbing at the time,
difficult but not traumas.
I defined trauma in a fairly simple way.
I defined trauma a lot,
like the way it was first defined in 1980
when PTSD became a diagnosis.
It's an event out of the range
of normal human experience.
So it's an unusual event that is violent
and or life-threatening.
And the most archetypal examples,
the most typical prototypical
examples are something
that in an event in which you could die,
be seriously injured or
endure sexual violation.
That's kind of the broader nexus.
And there are a lot of exceptions
and the kind of events
that fit that rubric.
Some events can also be
potentially traumatic
if we imagine them as violent
or life-threatening in a way that
even if they're happening
to somebody else,
we can imagine them happening, you know,
in such a way that might allow us
to feel traumatized by that.
But for the most part,
there are a lot of
really unpleasant events
that are just not traumatic events
or potential traumatic events.
And there's very good reason for that
because they inculcate
different reactions.
So say in, you know, a
devastating financial crisis.
A devastating relationship.
The end of a relationship.
Something that happens
that just changes your life
in a very negative way.
Those are very unpleasant events.
They can cause psychological harm,
but they're not traumatic events
or not potentially traumatic events.
And that's because the reactions
that they create look
different, feel different,
and have a different constellation.
Our brains do different things.
At least if we wanna
understand these events,
we need to be really clear about
how these different events play out,
different types of events.
Resilience is an outcome.
We tend to assume that
people are resilient
or not resilient, but
that just doesn't hold up
when we try to investigate that,
when we try to understand it.
We can only talk about resilience
in relation to something.
A person is resilient to
this thing that happened.
So when we think about, and in this case,
we can look at potentially
traumatic events,
we can look at broader
categories of events too,
things that depress people
or make people anxious.
We can be resilient to any
of these horrific events
or difficult events, taxing
events, unpleasant events.
And we are resilient if when
one of these events happens,
for the most part, we continue on a stable
trajectory of healthy functioning.
So we're able to endure
one of these events
and continue to function
relatively normally afterwards.
That doesn't mean we didn't get upset.
Most people do get pretty
upset when bad things happen.
That's natural.
In fact, our stress response
only works when we feel stress.
We have to trigger that response
in order to cope with it.
So most people do get pretty upset,
but resilience then is being able to kind
of continue functioning
in a way that we would
that is basically healthy.
And in the simplest terms,
that means having the capacity
to concentrate, to focus,
and do what you need to do in life.
One's job or whatever that might be,
and to be close and
intimate with other people.
And it turns out when we
study people over time,
the majority of people show
that resilient pattern.
We call it the resilience trajectory.
The majority of people will
endure a highly aversive,
a very extremely unpleasant event,
a potentially traumatic event,
and still be able to continue functioning
relatively normally,
relatively in a healthy way
as they had before.
The range varies a little bit on average,
it's around two-thirds
of the people exposed
to these events will show that pattern.
So most people are resilient,
but that still leaves many people
who will suffer in some lasting way
from exposure to one of
these aversive events.
And we've been able to identify
several different patterns
by tracking people over time.
One response is to become very upset
and struggle in a much
more, say, demanding
and difficult way for a
longer period of time.
And then gradually return to
a kind of a normative level.
Gradually return to
the kind of functioning
that seems to that person healthy.
And it could take a
year for that to happen,
sometimes even longer.
We call that a recovery pattern.
And we do see this, we
see quite a few people
showing this pattern.
So in other words, they are in a way more
disequilibrated, more
disturbed, more distressed
by the event over time than someone
who was showing that resilient pattern,
but they are going also to recover
and get back to their normal range.
Another pattern we see are some people
who are struggling more
than they expected to
and then they're not getting better.
They're getting worse.
And they gradually suffer more symptoms,
things begin to steamroll,
and then gradually they
get into high levels
of symptoms and they're really struggling
and they need professional help.
That could happen for
many different reasons.
It could be that whatever event they went
through has some lingering consequence,
maybe they were injured and
they suffer a lot of pain.
Maybe the event result in a
lot of upheaval in their life.
And so that upheaval is now continuing
make difficulties for them.
It may be they're upset
and disappointed that
they're not getting better
and they're getting depressed
about not getting better.
There are many different reasons for that.
That's a kind of a delayed pattern,
but it begins with struggling
and then getting gradually worse.
Then another pattern we see,
the third pattern among those
people who aren't resilient
is what we call basically chronic distress
or chronic symptomatology.
And that's a person who is
really seriously traumatized
by the event, really deeply upset
if it's not a potential traumatic event.
And they continue to
struggle for a long time.
And there's really kind of relentless
and it's long lasting harm.
And that's unfortunate, very
unfortunate, but it's real.
It happens in less than 10% usually,
but it does happen quite a bit.
I coined this phrase, "the
resilience blind spot"
to capture a phenomenon that
I've seen now for many years.
I saw this in the research I did
after the 9/11 attacks in New York City.
I was in New York City at the time.
I've saw it again recently
with the COVID-19 pandemic very clearly.
What happens with the
resilience blind spot
is it's most apparent with
a large scale disaster
because many people are affected
and there is a kind of a shared anxiety,
distress, concern,
upset among many people.
And there's a little bit
of social contagion there.
We tend to see other people being upset
and then we feel upset.
We worry more.
These events that 9/11, COVID-19 pandemic,
the super storm Sandy
that was in New York City
a number of years ago,
the tsunami in Japan.
Lots of these events, they happen,
they're going to happen again.
They're very, very disturbing.
And when people are upset,
it's just a way our minds work.
It's very hard for us to
believe that that won't last,
that that's a short-lived phenomenon.
This goes all the way back
to my friend and colleague
Dan Gilbert at Harvard had talked about
this in terms of affective forecasting.
When we're feeling emotion,
it's hard to imagine that it's ephemeral.
It's hard to imagine we
won't feel this way forever
or for a long time.
So when we are upset
because of a disaster,
a mass event that's fed by
all the attention it gets,
it's fed by the media,
it's fed by conversations
we have with other people,
it's fed by what we know is happening.
And it's so upsetting
that we live blinders
like a horse wears
blinders or a blind spot
like we have a blind spot in our eye
for the idea that this will
pass, that we'll be okay.
So what is happening in our brains
when we're exposed to a
potentially traumatic event?
To be perfectly honest,
we don't know the story in
full detail because we can't.
We can't put people in
experiments and traumatize them.
So most of what we know
is kind of extending
what we do know very
well about how we respond
to extreme stress.
And what we know from this research
is that we have a kind of a
remarkable stress response.
It's magnificent, actually,
in my mind. It's magnificent.
It's multifaceted. It's multiphasic.
It can last for a very
short time or a long time,
and it can manage different levels
and different kinds of challenges.
What happens initially,
which we used to know
is the fight or flight response,
that phrase was coined in the early 20th
century by the great
physiologist Walter Cannon.
He didn't have the tools we have now,
and so we've taken that
idea a lot further.
But, essentially, what happens is when
our sensory organs send
signals to the brain,
typically the midbrain,
they get shuffled around a little bit.
If they match some presets
or some things we've learned,
they get shuffled to another
structure, the amygdala,
and that may shuffle it
over to hypothalamus.
All of these structures
are kind of filtering
almost like little
computers, binary computers,
is this something threatening?
Is this dangerous?
It doesn't have to be fully verified.
It all it needs to do is match the kind
of the basic minimum
level of a possible strap,
and that will send a cascade
of biological responses
throughout our body.
Our brain orchestrates
how our body functions.
And it does this normally by keeping it
in a nice delicate balance of, you know,
things ramping up and ramping down
so that everything stays
kind of nice and balanced,
and functional in our bodies.
When that threat alarm goes off,
when those brain structures say
there's something really
dangerous going on right now,
it shifts that balance.
The things that we need
most get ramped up.
So blood gets pumped up.
We pump more blood, it
goes to the extremities.
We produce more glucose.
That goes to the extremities
too. We're gonna need that.
We breathe more heavily,
our eyes, our pupils dilate.
So we take in more information
and some of the things
that are not necessary
kind of gets shut down.
We don't need some of these
other bodily functions,
take them offline temporarily.
At the same time, there's a shift in
what our brains are doing from reflective,
thoughtful processing, well,
like what I'm doing right now,
to much more immediate, almost autopilot,
habitual and automatic processing
designed to deal with what
the brain thinks is happening.
That also has consequences
for how we experience
and remember these events
because it focuses only on the bits
and pieces of information
that are most relevant for our survival.
It doesn't care about the broader context,
the broader narrative thread.
It's just the things we need to know.
How fast is this moving?
How sharp is this thing?
How bad could this be if I fall?
All these bits and pieces of information.
If the threat continues
and the alarm continues to go off,
that sends more signals
and the structure of the hypothalamus
will then send signals through our blood,
neurochemical messengers through our blood
that will go down to the adrenal glands
and release cortisol.
Cortisol has been released earlier,
but it does something different now.
It travels through the blood
and when it reaches the brain,
it bonds with some of
those same brain structures
only now it results in genetic change
and epigenetic change in those structures
so they can do what they need to do,
even in a bigger way,
even more powerfully,
and they really ramp up
this stress response.
Things are not going well.
So we need a bigger response.
At the same time, there's a blockage
of our long-term memory,
which is really intriguing.
We can't voluntarily recall
things in the past very well
'cause we don't need that
information at this point.
It's just distracting.
We can remember details,
but we can't remember
narrative long-term memories
because we don't need them.
So that's happening, and that can last
for quite a long time
up to a couple hours.
And this cortisol, it's
wonderfully balanced.
It's kind of got a braking
system built into it.
So some cells allow cortisol to,
they react very strongly to cortisol
and they have kind of a what's called
a high affinity for cortisol.
So they respond right away very powerfully
to the presence of cortisol in the brain.
Other cells have a low
affinity of cortisol.
So there's a kind of a
building up of cortisol
and then it gets shut down
and gradually declines.
And that whole arc can
last a good couple hours.
We're in essentially an
alternative state of consciousness
during that time because our brains
are focused in a different way.
So, initially, we've gone
from this habitual automatic
kind of processing, eventually,
to a more reflective,
goal-driven processing
after time when that becomes necessary.
And that sweep is very interesting.
So I get very excited about this
because I think it's a marvelous system
and we all have this as part of
our basically inherited
biological capacity.
The brain activity we see in
relation to extreme levels
of stress has some clues about why people
also develop PTSD and
why many people don't.
Many people don't develop
PTSD or lasting harm
because these processes,
these brain processes
are very, very effective.
But for some people they
may be less effective
and that in part may be
because of a lack of cortisol,
and there's some evidence to suggest
that some people have
lower resting cortisol.
There are complicated reasons
why that may have come about.
There's still a lot of work
trying to figure that out.
Some people also have a more
sensitive cortisol break,
which shuts it down more quickly,
and that that seems to have an
epigenetic component meaning.
Some earlier life experiences
may have primed the system to be say,
not reactive enough or over reactive
in terms of shutting it down.
All of that is hard to
demonstrate in research
but that seems to be an emerging idea.
The way our brain works when
we're under extreme stress
results in very fragmented
memories of these events.
The bits and pieces.
And that's, I think, highly adaptive
because it gives us kind of
generic information we can use.
And next time something
really difficult happens
if it would happen again.
I remember after the tsunami in Tokyo,
I was shown a videotape
of an airport flooding
and I'd never seen an airport flooding.
And what I remember from that
as it just a couple key incidents,
the water arriving, how fast it came,
and what happened when
it met with the plains,
some things floated up,
other things didn't.
None of that was information
that I had before.
The rest of that video I don't remember,
but I remember those bits and pieces.
So that's the kind of experience we have
of most potential traumatic events,
bits and pieces of kind of
decontextualized information.
Now, whenever we remember something,
we re-remember it in a very organic way.
In my field, we call that
consolidating and reconsolidating.
When we remember something,
it's a biological event.
So we're consolidating all
that brain activity in some way
that we can remember it
when we go back to it.
And then when we go back to a memory,
we reactivate those
same biological systems
and then after we're
done thinking about them
they go back in the memory.
They get reconsolidated.
Only the difference is now
we have other experiences.
the experiences we had
when we were remembering.
So the memories gradually change.
And I think a lot of what
we think of as memories
of trauma are these bits
and pieces of information
that we later put together into a story.
And that's a very interesting phenomenon.
That's something that we're
still trying to understand,
but it can go for the
worse or for the better.
It goes for the worse, if we
then begin to tell ourselves
how horrible something was
and we begin to string pieces together
in a kind of a quasi invented narrative.
It can help us in the
future if we gradually
put some distance between
ourselves in that memory
and we gradually remember these
events in a more benign way
or in a way as if we were watching them.
And, in fact, we did
some research on people
who had gone through the 9/11 attacks.
People who were actually in the towers
or near the towers on September 11th.
All those people were in
life-threatening danger.
And what we found was the
people who either recovered
or showed that resilient pattern had
their memory changed over time.
Their memory of those
events became more benign.
And the people who remained
traumatized had pretty much,
they had some variation in their memory,
but it continued to be pretty
much a very disturbing memory.
So there's something in the
way we think about these events
over time that we don't
fully understand yet,
but it's a little bit removed
from what actually happened.
So what about the diagnosis of PTSD?
Is it useful to be diagnosed with PTSD
if somebody is generally
suffering from PTSD?
And I think in terms of my research,
we see that there are certainly people
generally suffering from PTSD.
The range varies,
but I think having a diagnosis of anything
that we're really struggling
with is useful, is helpful.
It's both comforting
because we now know what
it is we're struggling with
and it means that somebody else knows
what it is we're struggling with.
If somebody diagnoses us
and it means there are
treatments we can learn about
that are specifically for that
thing we're struggling with.
The downside of that is that
the PTSD diagnosis is porous
and people can be diagnosed
with PTSD when they
actually don't have PTSD.
And that does happen,
unfortunately, far too often.

- Chapter two: Developing
Tools to Overcome Trauma.
- When we began to become confident
that we really had
identified something real,
this resilience trajectory
I've talked about,
we've identified it in
many studies at this point,
it's been identified
convincingly in the majority
and over 100 research studies
by other people than myself,
lots of other people.
So it's very much a real thing.
The big question then is why
are most people resilient
and why are some people not resilient?
That turned out to be a harder question
to answer than I thought
because when we measure
the things that correlate
with resilience, the things
that co-occur with resilience,
we find loss of different factors.
The kind of a myth in the general public,
we see it in the media,
we see it in even in
some professional literature,
is that there are a few magic traits.
The three traits of
highly resilient people.
The five traits of
highly resilient people.
It turns out there are many, many factors
that have been associated with resilience,
but they all have what
we call small effects.
They don't explain very much.
They only explain a little
bit of who will be resilient.
So in other words, if somebody
says has positive thinking
or they're good at problem solving
or they're good at distracting themselves
or whatever it is that they
they do that is something
that helps them to be resilient.
It turns out that that only
predicts a little bit of whether
or not they will actually be
resilient when something happens.
I call that the resilience paradox.
We can identify these things,
but, paradoxically, they
don't actually predict
who will be resilient the
next time something happens.
And the reason for that it turns out is
because situations vary a great deal,
and there are cost and
benefits to everything.
So these different factors that
we think make us resilient,
these different behaviors,
even the go-to things
that we think we use when we are trying
to cope with adversity,
they only work sometimes.
They work sometimes in some situations
and they don't work very
well in other times.
Even the things that we think are kind
of our best shot don't always work.
So what that means is every
time something happens,
all of us, we have to work
out what's the best solution,
what's the best strategy
for this particular moment right now?
This particular situation I'm in.
And I call that process of doing
that adaptive flexibility.
I've also called it
regulatory flexibility.
Adaptive flexibility is
basically a set of skills
that most people have actually,
which is a good thing.
Most people have those skills,
they're also highly learnable.
But even if we have those skills,
we have to use the skills
we have and that's work.
And in order to do that work,
we have to be motivated,
we have to believe that
we'll be able to do it
otherwise we won't even try.
And that belief, that idea that
I'll get through this eventually.
I'm not happy this happened,
this really sucks, this is painful,
it's ruining my life, but I'll
get through this eventually.
That's the belief that we
need in order to do that work.
We need to somehow think
we'll get through it.
We call this the flexibility mindset.
There are three core beliefs that seem
to comprise the flexibility mindset.
They're related and they
feed off each other.
One of them is optimism.
That's essentially a belief
or conviction that it's going to be okay.
The future will be okay,
this isn't good now,
but it will be okay in the future.
You know, you can see this in sports,
you can see it in many
other domains of life.
There are some athletes
who have all the skills in the world,
but if they don't have the motivation,
if they don't have the sense of purpose,
they're not going to perform well.
And you see this over and over in sports,
we need always to have that motivation,
that belief that I'll get through this.
I can do it.
So another one of those beliefs
is confidence of coping,
sometimes called coping self-efficacy.
And this is essentially a
belief that I have some ability
to cope and most people do.
Most people have at least some coping
that they can do some behavior,
some coping mechanisms that they can use.
So it's a sense of reminding
ourselves, I can cope.
The third belief.
The third component of this that appears
to be part of the mindset is
what we call challenge orientation.
Sometimes called challenge appraisal.
And that's when we think
of threatening events
in terms of the challenge at hand,
what we need to do to get through it.
You know, when we're first
confronted with a threat,
we naturally assess the threat
because we need to know
how bad something is.
But that at some point we have
to shift from thinking about the threat
to thinking about what we
need to do to get past it.
If we stay too focused on the threat,
we're paralyzed by that.
So the challenge appraisal is a sense of,
all right, what happened?
What's the challenge here?
What do I need to do?
Our research program
gradually began to point
to three key components, three steps of
what we now call the flexibility sequence.
I pulled these together for the first time
in my recent book, "The End of Trauma"
and lay them out in some detail.
The first step and all three
of these come from our research.
The first step we call
contact sensitivity.
And this is where we stop and we,
when something is
disturbing us, we're upset.
We stop and we reflect and we
think, what is the problem?
What's happening right now?
What's the problem and
what do I need to do?
And this is really about the moment.
You know, one of the difficulties
we experience sometimes
when we're really upset
by something is we take
a very broad perspective.
This thing happened, it's
ruining my life. It's horrible.
That's too big of a problem
to undo all at once.
We need to take it in pieces.
What's the problem at hand?
What's the problem in this moment
that's really bothering me?
It may be that I'm feeling anxious.
It may be that when I
go to this one place,
I get really anxious
'cause this is the place
where this thing happened.
It may be any number
of of reactions we have
and we have to take these one at a time.
When we think about,
okay, I need to sleep.
The problem is I'm not sleeping well
and that's making me
unhappy during the day
and it's making me have
trouble concentrating
and then I'm worried about
my job, whatever that may be.
What do I need to do?
I need to focus on solving that problem.
How do I sleep better?
Or I need to focus on feeling
less anxious in the moment.
Once we've done that, we have
a clear problem we can solve.
We move to the second
step of the sequence,
which we call repertoire.
And here we decide on
a strategy we'll use.
We call it repertoire though,
because all of us have a
repertoire of personal strategies,
the things that we know how to do,
the things we've used in the past,
and we choose from that repertoire.
It's kind of like a toolbox.
We open up that toolbox and we say,
alright, I need to sleep better
or I need to feel a
little less anxious now,
or I need to find a way not
to feel threatened when
I'm in this situation.
And we look in that toolbox and we decide
which of these tools is going
to be best to use right now?
And we try something out that
takes us to the third step,
which we call feedback.
And this is basically very
quite simple in a way.
We just simply monitor what we just did
and ask ourselves, is it working?
As simple as that may sound,
this is really a key step
because a lot of people give up here.
If they try something, it doesn't work,
they think, I can't deal with this,
I just can't cope with this.
I tried, you know, doing this thing
where I distract myself,
so I won't think about it.
I tried getting wrapped up in my job,
which really helps me a lot
and I still kept thinking about it.
So I can't cope with this,
and that's actually a very
dangerous misconception, I think,
because what we need to
do in this situation is,
and as it laid out in
the flexibility sequence
is we go back to the repertoire step
and we try something else.
We try another strategy.
And we might have to
continue trying strategies
several times before
something actually works.
Or if we've tried many strategies,
it may be that we have
to go all the way back
to the beginning and
think about the problem
in slightly different terms.
What is, maybe I'm focusing too broadly,
I'm focusing on the wrong problem.
What's the problem that
I can solve right now?
There's a lesson in all of this
in these different pieces
of the flexibility sequence
because not only does it
give us tools for dealing
with these challenges, these
averse events we experience,
it also essentially is teaching
us about our own mastery.
We can actually do something
about these events.
We can actually work these
things out ourselves over time.
And it does teach us
really that we don't need
to simply let things happen to us.
There's a phrase, "Time heals all ills"
and time does heal things,
but time is in no rush.
Time takes a long time.
So we can actually get in there
and work to get ourselves
through these events
in a way that we're making the decisions.
We're trying things out.
The good way to think about this is
even when we try something
and it doesn't work,
we've tried it, it's been
our choice to try it.
And we know, okay, this isn't working,
let me see what else I have.
And over time we also begin
to learn more about our tools.
We learn more about
how we perceive things,
we learn more about the tools we have,
and we can actually kind of think, okay,
this tool worked pretty
well in this situation
and now I know I have this tool
and I saw somebody else,
I heard about somebody else
doing this other thing.
Maybe I'll try that in the future.
I'll put that in my toolbox.
So there are a lot of ways
that we can grow as people
and become more efficacious
and more independent in a way
with these kinds of tools.
I think there's a kind
of a general idea that
it's pretty easy to latch onto
that somebody might think
I've been traumatized
and it's really ruining my life
and, you know, I just
have to limit my life now.
And there's nothing I can do about it.
It's just happened to me.
And there's a lot of helplessness
built into that idea.
And the flexibility notion,
the sense that we can actually get in
and change the way we're
experiencing the world,
the way things are happening to us.
The challenges we face-
I think gives us a lot more
efficacy, a lot more mastery,
a lot more sense of agency in
how we deal with these events.
I coined the term the
fallacy of uniform efficacy,
because I see this in the way people talk,
and I see this actually in
my own research discipline.
This idea that there's some
behaviors, some strategies
that people can use that are just golden.
They always work.
They are the perfect strategies,
and then there are others
that are just not healthy.
They're maladaptive.
Don't do these things,
these things are unhealthy.
And in fact that doesn't hold
up to the research at all.
So that the fallacy of uniform efficacy is
that any strategy is
always good or always bad.
And we find that there are strategies
that people like to use.
There are strategies that are healthy
and good strategies to use,
but in certain situations,
even the most unhealthy strategy
can actually be adaptive.
I call this coping ugly.
It's the idea that say something
like doing some impulsive
thing is not really healthy.
You know, you should behave.
You don't need to be
self-destructive here.
If you do something that once
or twice in certain situations,
it's actually can be
just what you need to do.
John Lennon wrote a song,
"Whatever gets you through the night".
And that's exactly what
this kind of idea embodies.
By the same token,
the things that we think
are always healthy,
we should just do these things.
They're not always efficacious.
They don't always work.
Great examples are
something like mindfulness.
Mindfulness is good stuff,
there's no doubt about that.
But mindfulness isn't always
going to solve a problem
unless you are maybe one of the 18 people
in the world who can
meditate all day long.
Most of us can't do that.
Most of us use mindfulness
in a kind of a daily way
or however anybody uses it.
That's going to help a lot,
but it's not gonna solve every problem.
Social support is another one.
Turning to other people for comfort
and advice that helps in many situations,
but it doesn't always help.
It doesn't always give us what we need
for a particular problem.
The way I actually got into a lot
of this flexibility research was
by studying emotional suppression.
I was doing research on
suppression at the time.
There were a lot of people
beginning to study this behavior,
but it had developed
this kind of reputation
as being uniformly bad,
uniformly maladaptive.
And there are plenty of anecdotal examples
that show that suppression
can be very adaptive in some situations.
For example, in our 9/11 research parents
who are with young children
told us in interviews that they had to
really suppress all the emotions
they were experiencing at the moment
'cause they didn't wanna
frighten their children.
When you're in the midst
of a tremendously challenging
situation like a war,
for example, there are times when we have
to just simply bottle up
whatever we're feeling
because we need to remain
focused on what we're doing.
We need to concentrate.
There's some research even about
suppressing positive emotions.
There have been some studies where
the people winning awards,
people winning sporting events
if the the winners show
too much positive emotion,
other people actually don't like them
because they feel like
they're being inconsiderate
of the losers; the people who didn't win.
So in many social situations,
many dangerous situations
where we need to suppress
the emotions we feel.
Of course, in other
situations that's not adaptive
because in other situations
we need that information.
What are our emotions telling us?
So like every strategy we use,
it depends on the situation,
it depends on the challenge
we're facing in that moment.
So often this simply comes
down to trial and error,
and trying something, asking
ourselves, is this working?
And if it's working great,
let's keep doing it.
If it's not working, we
need to try something else.
Adaptive flexibility and
the flexibility mindset,
the flexibility sequence,
these concepts can also be useful
if we're thinking about how to cope
with something that happened some time ago
as say a a potentially traumatic event
that did cause us lasting harm
and is still causing us lasting harm.
In this case, we though have to focus on
using it the way we use
it for current events.
So if we think about a traumatic event
that really did upend our life
that we're still struggling
with, we tend to think of that event
and we will tend to think of that event
in a sort of broad, generic way.
I was traumatized by this event.
It's changed my life.
I can't go out anymore.
I don't do the things I used to do.
My relationships are not so
good anymore because of this
'cause I'm kind of in this broken state.
That's a problem that
can't be solved in one go.
It's too big of a problem.
But what we can do, just like anything
that's happening currently in our life,
is we go through the
steps of the sequence,
the flexibility sequence,
and think about it in terms
of what's the problem in the moment,
what's happening right now?
What is a piece of this problem
that's bothering us and
that we can address?
An example comes to mind of someone
I knew long time ago who was traumatized
to such a point that that
person never went out anymore.
They were worried that if they went out,
they would have a flashback
and be overwhelmed
and be somewhere out in public
in this sort of flashback,
you know, panic attack state.
So that became the problem.
How can I go out into the world
despite the fact that I am
feeling quite vulnerable,
quite fragile at the moment?
The solution was to first
identify that problem,
then to think about strategies
that might help with
that particular problem.
And that led to a gradual
kind of realization.
That person could tell
friends had never told a lot
of friends that he had PTSD,
he could tell friends he had PTSD
and then those friends could
be kind of safe houses for him.
So that was a step. Try that
out. How's that working?
Then again, so we go through
the trial and error process.
Let's try telling some
friends, I have PTSD
and let's try then going out
and knowing that we can call
them, they agreed to this.
That call them if I'm feeling upset,
that seemed to work really well.
I went out the other day, I tried this,
I felt a little uneasy.
I called my friend. I went over there.
I didn't have a flashback, I
didn't have a panic attack,
but I was able to feel like I could go
to safety if I needed it.
Okay, that worked. Let's
expand it a little bit.
And that person gradually developed
a way to get back out in the world.
That gave him more confidence in
what he could do out in the world
that allowed him to deal
with some other pieces of the problem.
So he broke it down that way
and took it one at a time,
tried to find the solutions
to the trial and error approach,
paying attention to the feedback.
Did it work? If it worked, great.
If it didn't work, try something else.
And that gradually allowed him
to give himself more latitude in his life.
He had tools to address
the pieces of the problem.
We can use self-talk as both as a tool
and a reminder for how to use
the flexibility components in our lives.
So self-talk is something we naturally do.
We condense what's going on in our mind,
and our minds running all the time,
and we sometimes condense
what's going on in our
mind into a few sentences.
We might say them aloud or we
might say them to ourselves.
Unfortunately, a lot of
self-talk we use is negative.
We might say to your ourselves,
"ah, dummy" or something
along those lines.
Why did you do that?
But it can also be used positively.
And people do naturally
use positive self-talk.
The classic one word, "yes". Yes.
You see this in sporting events,
you see it in other contexts,
people taking an exam or some context,
and that has been harnessed
in many different disciplines.
It's been harnessed in education.
It's been harnessed to
a great deal in sports
and in clinical context as well.
It's a way of condensing
what we're thinking
to phrases that we can use
then to remind ourselves
and guide us through some behavior.
So for the flexibility mindset,
we might actually make a little chart
of these kinds of phrases.
In my recent book, "The End of Trauma",
I have a little chart of
these phrases in the back,
but there's simple things like
for the flexibility mindset,
we can tell ourselves things
like, it's gonna be okay;
I have some tools to work with this.
Or for challenge appraisals,
so what's going to be okay would be
being optimistic about it.
It'll be okay. The future will be okay.
Confidence in coping.
That would be something
along the lines of:
I have some tools. I know how to cope.
And challenge appraisal
would be something like,
okay, this sucks.
I didn't want this to happen.
What do I need to do to get through this?
For the flexibility sequence,
these are also quite simple
for assessing the context.
We can say to ourselves,
what's happening now?
What do I need to do? And that
actually is quite powerful.
I've found I've used this in my own life
when I'm struggling with something
and it's a little confusing.
I'm feeling upset and then
sort of take a second back
and say, what's happening?
What do I need to do here?
And it really helps us focus in on
a core piece of the problem.
What is it that I need to do right now?
Once we do that then the repertoire stage,
we can just say, so what
tools do I have in my toolbox?
What kind of things can I
use here to cope with this?
These are simple statements,
but they have a way of focusing our mind.
And when we're talking about
the flexibility sequence,
this is a kind of a dialogue.
A lot of self-talk are just
simply statements like,
I'll get through this, this'll be okay.
But when we talk about
the flexibility sequence,
we're actually asking
ourselves a question.
We're having a dialogue with ourselves.
It's almost like having
ourselves in the room next to us,
asking us these questions.
And it's simple and
easy and very effective.
There's a phrase that is often used
when my work is talked about,
summarized as, "you are
stronger than you think".
I'm a little leery of that
phrase because it's presumptive.
I don't know what anybody thinks,
but it is fair to say, I think there's
a kind of a cultural trend toward thinking
we're all pretty fragile right now.
I think that's more
and more been the case.
And I don't know exactly why it all is.
It has something to do with the internet
has got us focused on how dangerous,
how harmful the world is right now
by all the things that we perceive
that we're fed because
it gets our attention.
But there's also a lot of
industry that's sprung up
around this idea, the industry that feeds
off the idea that we
are broken and fragile.
And I think that's not a good trend.
And I think, as I've said,
the flexibility ideas
are kind of a counter to that because it
puts us back in the driver's seat.
But I think that it's
good to remind ourselves
of how strong we actually are.
It can sometimes seem like a tough sell.
This idea that you are,
you can actually get through something.
That you're stronger than you might
think you are at the moment.
But it's really important
to cut yourself a little slack
and to allow yourself
to take on that belief
for a little while at least
to let yourself dig in
and try to move forward with your life.
And you can remind yourself,
both that you are strong.
You can also remind yourself
of all the times you've
been strong in the past,
all the things you've got to.
You know, a little
exercise that I like to do
is to think back in my own life
in the past when something
had really upset me
as something had led
me to feel like my life
was really going to take a dark turn
or some bad thing had happened
and then I got through it.
And I would love if
someone from the future
could have come back to me then and said,
"Hey, you know, you got through this,"
right when I was struggling with it.
"You know, you're struggling now,
"but you actually-I know
I'm from the future.
"You got through this," and it's hard.
Something that we don't
tend to believe at the time,
we tend to feel like this
struggle is means I am weak.
You know, there's a related literature
from the wonderful work by
Carol Dweck on growth mindset.
And that's the idea that if we think
that something is fixed,
a quality in us is fixed,
then we tend to give up.
If it looks like we're failing,
that means that we must not be good.
If it's fixed and I'm failing,
it means I must be bad at this.
But like many things in life,
flexibility is about trying,
it's about using the
skills and doing the work
to get through something.
So resilience is not fixed.
Resilience is an outcome,
and the idea with the
flexibility is to get in there
and dig in and work to
get through something.
And when we do that, more often than not,
we do get through it.
If we think, you know, I'm doing poorly,
that means I'm broken.
We are not going to get
anywhere with that attitude.
The best we can do is
to just give ourselves
the chance to believe we'll
get through a situation,
and most of the time we will.

- Chapter three: The History
of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
- We often think about whether
life is more traumatic now
than in the past because
the idea of trauma
is so ubiquitous now.
I think it would be a hard argument to win
to think that life is more traumatic now
than in the past or more difficult.
One of the things that's happening now
is that more than in the past actually,
is that there's so much
of a focus on trauma.
And I think the primary
reason is there are a couple
different factors that come together.
One is that our brains
are very much wired,
if I can use that phrase.
They're not really wired,
but they're very much
preset to pick up danger
and immediate threat
because for that makes perfect sense
from an evolutionary perspective.
We can dive very quickly
if we're not careful.
So our brains are set to detect those kind
of dangers in our environment.
Now we have the internet,
and the internet has
become gone from this kind
of interesting idea in the beginning
to unite the world and communication.
It's gone from that to an
enormous moneymaking machine.
And the money on the internet is about
capturing your attention.
The more it can capture
people's attention,
the more advertising
revenues can be generated.
And that's just how it works now.
And everybody knows this is not a mystery.
So the more that- and in that context,
it's easy to capture people's attention
with threatening things, with
information about dangers.
Look at what happened.
Look at what's happening here.
Look at these people, how upset they are.
Look at how unhinged, how
damaged this person is.
All of these things capture
our attention big time.
It's hard not to look at those things
because our brains want to know.
We want to know where the dangers are.
So there's more, and more, and more
of that than there's ever been before.
On TikTok, which is everybody knows
is a social media platform,
there is something, a phenomenon
called trauma dumping.
People are posting their
traumatic experiences
on TikTok and then there are sites
that are gathering those into one place
and those are enormously profitable.
So this kind of thing,
you know, doom scrolling,
all of these things, these
words that we have now
are because we can't look away.
So in that context, we
gradually come to believe
whether we realize it or not,
that we're now seeing the world
as an increasingly dangerous place.
A place that can harm us.
And we begin to see our own failings
as a result of all of this harm.
A very interesting question is,
what trauma was like in the past?
If we think about the fact that we do seem
to focus on trauma much more now,
were people not traumatized
in the past as much?
Well, it's very curious
because if we go back in time,
we see hardly any
references at all to trauma,
to the symptoms of trauma
that anything like PTSD,
of course the concept
of PTSD we wouldn't see,
but there's really no mention really
of people being traumatized,
having nightmares
and being harmed by an
event, a potential trauma.
We don't see that really at
all in historical literature.
And, you know, we do see
plenty of evidence for grief.
We can go all the way back to Homer,
The Iliad and The Odyssey.
There's plenty of mention
of soldiers openly grieving.
So people knew about that.
People honored that. All
those gory battle scenes.
There's no mention of soldiers having PTSD
like symptoms in any of
the accounts, really.
Maybe a little bit of
a hint here and there.
As we get into the 16th
century, 17th century,
there are actually some
kind of quasi accounts,
but we don't really get
into any full blown mention
of something like psychological trauma,
until the 19th century.
Until near the end of the 19th century,
and it was actually a German physician
who mentioned it for the
first time right at the end
of the 19th century called
the traumatic neurosis.
Then we of course come
into the 20th century
and we have World War I
and we're now beginning to,
we have newspapers, we have
much more cultural transmission,
and we have the idea of shell shock
that caught on in World War I
and World War I was a pretty horrific war.
Modern weaponry had advanced
to the point where it,
in a sense outpaced war tactics
leading to a lot of carnage.
Not that there wasn't carnage in the past,
but in around the time of World War I,
we began to think about this idea
of something called shell shock.
It wasn't universally accepted.
In fact, many people
were considered cowards
if they claimed to have shell shock.
And there was a famous phrase
in England called, "shot at dawn",
which meant that if a
soldier had said they didn't,
they weren't going to fight
or they couldn't go back to the front
because they had shell shock.
They were shot for
cowardness. Shot at dawn.
And that really happened quite frequently.
Then there was a little bit
of a lull. It was well known.
It's documented in literature
and things in the 20th century
that some soldiers seemed
to be broken by the war.
Then World War II happens
and we had a lot of the same situation
where soldiers were being
psychologically disturbed.
It still wasn't clear though.
People were not clear what to call that.
That didn't really change until 1980,
and this is in the aftermath
of the Vietnam War.
Up until that point,
pretty much the early
mental health manuals,
if they talked about anything like trauma,
they didn't really use the word trauma.
And they talked about it more in terms
of there's something
wrong with that person.
There's a weakness in that person.
There some deficit in them
that allowed them to be traumatized.
And that changed in 1980
with the advent of PTSD.
A lot of it had to do with the Vietnam War
where it was a pretty horrific war.
Wars are generally horrific.
The Vietnam War was US soldiers
fighting in the jungle.
So it was guerilla warfare.
The soldiers were not
really prepared for that.
It was a very unpopular war.
When soldiers came home from that war,
many soldiers developed drug addiction
as a way to cope with that war.
When they came home, they were
not often treated very well
because the war was very unpopular,
even though soldiers were drafted.
That was a war by draft.
Soldiers who had been drafted basically
had no choice but to go to the
war or face criminal charges
or leave the country.
So those soldiers were often castigated
for having been soldiers and
many of them self-medicated.
They had no other way to
take care of themselves,
and that led a lot of treatment providers.
Finally, in 1980 to designate PTSD
as an officially recognized disorder
so they could actually
treat those soldiers.
So when we think about this history,
the absence of trauma in
the historical record,
it really begs the question, well,
maybe we're just making it up now.
I don't think that's true,
especially I've worked with people
who have PTSD as a therapist
and it's very clear to me
some people really are harmed by trauma.
So what's going on there?
In the past, weren't people traumatized?
A really nice piece of
information to fit into that.
There's a diaries of Samuel Pepys.
Samuel Pepys was an aristocrat
in the 17th century.
He was a contemporary of Isaac
Newton. He knew the king.
I think that was Charles
the 16th in England.
And Pepys was in the
inner circle of the king.
When the London fire happened in 1666,
it was a horrific fire.
Huge portion of London
burned in that fire.
The king asked Samuel Pepys to go around
and assess the damage
and report back to him.
So Pepys saw the extent
of it. He felt the heat.
He felt like his feet were
burning through his shoes.
He saw horrific flames,
and smoke, and carnage.
He saw the whole thing.
It was very disturbing to
him and it effected him.
Now, we wouldn't have
really know about Pepys.
It wasn't for the fact
that he kept a diary
for about 10 years.
He wrote everything down.
He wrote unabashedly, everything down
and largely because he wrote it in a kind
of a code he invented,
not a tremendously difficult
code, but it was a code.
He didn't intend anybody
to read it in his lifetime.
So he felt free to speak
completely uninhibited, uncensored.
When he died, he left all his books,
including those diaries to
the University of Cambridge.
And it was about a hundred years
before anybody took a good look at them
and then realized there was something
there and decoded them, and
they're absolutely fascinating.
They're like looking into the brain
of somebody in the 17th century
and listening to what they say
and how they experience the world.
And Pepys talked about that fire.
He talked about his reactions to that fire
and how confused he was.
Months later, he was having nightmares.
And I think about six months later,
he wrote in his diary
something to the effect
that he could not understand
why he couldn't sleep
because of fear of the fire.
Fear of fire, and why he was
having nightmares about fire.
He was basically having PTSD symptoms.
And what's interesting
about these Pepys diaries
is he was confused by that.
He didn't understand why he
was having those symptoms.
Now this is one very
nice piece of evidence,
but it's only one piece of evidence.
But it suggests to us
that he was having
genuine trauma symptoms,
but they were so unspoken about, unknown,
that he didn't understand what it was
and why it was having them.
And I think that's probably a better way
that we can think about this,
that people did have trauma symptoms,
but they were just kind of this thing
that nobody talked about and
nobody really acknowledged.

- Chapter four: The Psychology of Grief.
- When I finished my PhD,
I was looking to change directions a bit.
I had been studying
experimental clinical psychology
and I wanted to get a little bit broader,
more in the realm of what
people do in their daily lives.
And I was offered a
position in San Francisco
at the University of California
in San Francisco studying bereavement.
Now, I knew almost nothing
about bereavement at the time,
and, frankly, I wasn't interested.
So I thought about this a bit,
looked into the literature,
and when I looked into the literature,
I was kind of surprised.
I was actually amazed.
The literature was so antiquated.
It looked like a literature
from the 19th century.
The assumption was everybody grieves,
and it's a horrible thing for everybody.
Everybody needs clinical
help- just about everybody.
So I thought this was very intriguing.
When I looked at the methods being used,
I realized these were also
not very modern methods.
So I took this position in San Francisco
and I had a lot of
resources at my disposal
to study how people cope
with the death of a spouse.
What we did was not so much revolutionary
as just common sense in a sense.
I used the techniques I've learned,
I used the research methods I've learned
instead of getting a clinical sample,
people looking for treatment,
we got a broad range of people,
literally anybody who lost a spouse
within a few months of that time,
and we studied them using the
techniques, as it mentioned.
I learned like coding
their facial expressions,
running people through experiments
with psychophysiology attached,
transcribing what they said
and doing text analysis
following people over time.
And almost immediately we saw
that most people were coping really well.
The majority of people
were resilient to loss.
I wasn't actually expecting that,
but that was kind of an
interesting surprise.
We then did another study
and found the same thing.
And that led to, basically,
my entire research career,
we broadened into studying
trauma eventually,
and we've been using a lot
of those same techniques
for the next 30 years.
And, basically, finding that
most people are resilient.
Sometimes I have called
the death of a loved one,
a potentially traumatic event,
simply because that term allows for a kind
of a broader inclusiveness,
but grief and trauma are
really very different.
They are different kinds of events
and they result in very
different reactions,
very different brain activity,
very different longer term
processes on our part.
A potentially traumatic
event is an intense
life-threatening event that turns on
all kinds of emergency reactions,
and that in a way forces us to rethink
what life is a little bit.
The death of a loved one does
something very different.
The death of a loved
one tells our brain that
what we think is the
world is like in terms
of other people, isn't correct anymore.
It also introduces an existential threat,
a big existential threat.
'cause most of the time,
as the Buddhists say,
"Life is impermanent,"
you know, we don't live-
we live only a certain period of time,
and that's a fact that we just don't
keep in our awareness very much.
And when a loved one dies,
it's staring us in the face.
That person that I knew
doesn't exist anymore.
So these are very challenging events.
These bereavement events
are very challenging.
Most people cope well with them
over time like anything else,
but they still require
us to get through them.
One of the things that happens
when we lose a loved one
is we become very sad.
And sadness is highly functional.
All emotions are functional.
They do something.
We've evolved emotions for a
reason as they do something.
And what sadness does is it
turns our attention inward.
In contrast to trauma
where there's a uptick
in arousal, we're on edge.
When we lose a loved one,
our system slows down.
We actually have a decrease in heart rate.
We kind of- the world slows down
and we withdraw from the world
some deeper into our own heads,
for lack of a better word.
The reason that happens is,
and the reason that that's adaptive is
because when we're attached
to someone, anyone,
and when I say attached,
I mean it in the most common sense way
that people have become
a part of who we are.
They're in our minds.
We think of those people
when they're not there,
and they become a little bit
of a part of our identity,
this relationship with this person.
The people that we're deeply attached
to are often not in
our life at the moment.
That's just the way life works.
They're off somewhere else during the day
or whatever, but they're in our minds.
When that person dies,
our brain is completely confused by that.
Our brain doesn't know what
to do with that information
'cause our brain is not a being.
It's an organ inside our head.
We are the being. So the
brain needs to recalibrate.
It needs to come up with a way
of thinking of the world where that person
is no longer living and no
longer living in the fresh,
but they can still be in our mind.
In the old Freudian concept,
it was a kind of a question of,
I think Freud used the word decathecting,
I never fully understood what that meant,
but it means to something
along the lines of sort
of breaking the bond with that person.
So you're no longer grieving,
but I don't think that's
actually what we do.
What we do is, we can still be attached
to somebody in our minds.
We can still have tremendous
love and affection for somebody
and wish we could be with them,
but we have to realize that they're dead.
It's quite difficult, very difficult;
and we're gradually
come into terms with it,
this new information.
There's a very prevalent idea
that is dominated the way a lot
of people thought about grief is
the so-called five stages: denial, anger,
bargaining, depression, and acceptance.
And this idea was that we
go through these five stages
in sequence until we are then done
with the grieving process.
Unfortunately, there's really no evidence.
There never has been that
this is how we grieve.
We don't see this when we
look at what people are doing,
when we look at resilient
people, for example,
that most bereaved people show
this resilient trajectory.
They're already basically functioning
and moving on very early on.
It seems highly unlikely that they did
a kind of a five stages on
steroids in order to get through.
They probably just, they go
through a different process.
And we see a much different,
much more idiosyncratic process
than most people go through.
It's very personal. It's
not so neat and tidy.
In fact, the five stages
were originally formulated
for in the Kubler-Ross's work on
how people face their own death.
And there's no research on that
either, for obvious reasons.
It'd be pretty hard to research people
facing their own death.
But she had proposed that as
what based on her clinical work
with people facing their own death,
she had proposed those stages.
And then another group of investigators
foisted those stages onto bereavement.
So she actually didn't propose those
as the way people grieve.
But somehow that became the way
that most people now think of loss.
It's a very dangerous idea.
It may be helpful to some people
because we do like having a roadmap.
We do like having something predictable.
But the problem is that a lot of people
will be very upset that they don't,
they don't seem to be
going through those stages.
Or other people in their life
will tell them, you know,
you're not doing this right
because you shouldn't be
already feeling good right now
because you haven't gone
through this stage yet.
You haven't gone through
this depression stage
or this denial stage.
So you're going to be in
trouble in the future.
So it can be really problematic.
Actually, a wonderful,
sad but wonderful example
of this comes from the spinal
cord injury literature.
I did some research on spinal cord injury
and looking at that literature
because as usual, we found
that most people are resilient.
And people who suffer
spinal cord injuries,
permanent loss of bodily functioning,
also show the same resilient pattern
even when they're in the hospital.
Soon after the event, they'll show
that same healthy psychological
functioning across time.
In trying to understand all that,
I looked to the spinal
cord injury literature.
And I found a book from the 1960s when
that literature was just
beginning to take off.
And one of the chapters in that book argue
that if a spinal cord injury
patient isn't depressed,
their doctor should make them depressed
so that they can go through
the stages toward recovery.
And that's a kind of a bizarre idea.
A common thing that bereaved people report
is that they have these
quasi hallucinations.
They think they see somebody in public,
a person passes by that looks like them,
and you swear that there
they are right there.
What are they doing here? They're dead.
Or people report, you know, being home,
and then they might hear
keys jingling in the hallway
if they live in an apartment building
and thinking their partners coming home
only to realize that that's
somebody else's keys.
Those kind of quasi hallucinations.
'cause the brain is still operating
on the assumption that
they're still alive.
The brain is a prediction machine.
The brain is constantly trying
to predict what life is.
What will happen next?
And it needs to go through this process
where we gradually recalibrate,
reconfigure the world
without that person living,
and it takes time.
So we go deep into ourselves.
We're trying to think
through who was that person?
What can I carry forward in a way?
So this is actually one
of the interesting things
that we do, is that we kind of condense
what we knew of the person in their life
into a form that we can take with us
almost as if we had something tangible
that this is the person.
This is their life.
This is the relationship I had with them.
We're very generous when we do that.
We tend to idealize a little bit here.
Not a tremendous amount, but a little bit.
We round off the rough spots.
We don't necessarily forget some
of the negative things that a person did,
but, and sometimes there are a lot
of negative things we
have to contend with,
but we tend to round off or
we give them a little slack.
We do this in mourning ceremonies as well.
Mourning ceremonies are
interestingly oriented
around the very
psychological processes that
we actually have to go through.
So in morning ceremonies,
people tell stories about
the person that's deceased.
They tell stories about
the person that they knew.
And those stories serve
the exact same function.
They're pleasant.
They round off the rough spots
and they condense it
down into these memories,
and we can then carry that
forward, this idealized version.
The interesting thing about sadness,
it's so ubiquitous when
people are grieving
and it's functional, it
does what it needs to do.
It helps us when we turn inward.
But when we turn inward, we're vulnerable
because we're not paying
attention to the world around us.
Now, this is fine if
we're in our own home,
of course the danger is that we'll stay
in our internal world to such an extent
that we begin to ruminate
and that actually can
lead to a worse outcome.
But it's also dangerous
in the modern world
simply 'cause we're not paying attention.
It might be driving a car
and not paying attention
or in the subway and not paying attention.
Walking down the street,
any number of things,
making a meal and getting lost in sadness
and forgetting about it.
Leaving a burner on the stove.
All those things are quite dangerous.
In our evolutionary past,
it was much more dangerous
because there were predators
and there were lots of other dangers
that people had to contend with.
So we've seemed to have evolved a kind
of an oscillatory way of grieving.
We go inward, we do this sad,
deep kind of internal reflection
and then we come back out.
We attend to the world around us again.
We attend to the people around us
and then we might go back in.
So we go in and out of these phases of,
of focusing on the world around us
and turning deeply inward.
And that seems to be a
much more adaptive way.
We've seen this in our own research
when we studied laughter and smiling.
Well, it turns out that
most bereaved people
will show genuine laughter and smiling
even when they're struggling,
even when they were crying moments ago.
We can do this in our research
by coding the muscles in the face.
And there's certain muscle reactions
that we see in the face
that are indicative
of genuine positive emotion.
We see them when people smile genuinely
and when they laugh genuinely.
And what we found is in
interviews we've done,
is that people might be talking
about the loss and crying
and their face is just contorted in pain.
And then seconds later they're
thinking of a funny story
and they're actually laughing
as they're telling the story,
and they're still tears
running down their face.
And they might be in that
state for three or four minutes
and then they'll go back into
this deep internal state.
And this is a kind of a
turning in and turning out.
But the laughter part's also
because they're connecting socially
with the people that are around.
And that's very important part of life
is a very important part of bereavement
because we need other people
to help us through loss.
And when we connect back with them
and we laugh, laughter's contagious.
It's a way of almost
giving people something.
You know, you're taking care of me,
but I'm going to smile and
laugh with you for a little bit
and that makes other people feel good.
And then we'll go back in.
And then we've seen this
many times in the research
and it really seems to be again,
part of the marvelous set of tools
we have to cope with life.
We sometimes see anger during bereavement.
We see lots of other
emotions during bereavement.
Anger is, like a lot of negative emotions,
it's very useful in specific situations
and specific contexts.
When anger happens during bereavement,
it's usually when we feel like
this pain we're experiencing
is in some way somebody's fault.
That could be the medical establishment.
It could be ourselves.
We can be angry at ourselves
for we perceive not doing
something we could have done.
People are sometimes angry
with the person that died
for not doing the thing that
would've helped them survive.
That's useful to a point,
again, as it fits the situation.
If there's a time when
we need this to simply
sort of get that off
our chest, if you will,
or, you know, those are
thoughts we're having,
we want to express those thoughts,
that's when the anger can be useful.
It becomes maladaptive if we do it a lot,
if we do it all the time.
Just like anything else
in the broader idea about flexibility.
Anything that we do too
often is maladaptive
'cause we're not paying
attention to the situation.
So some anger is useful. A
lot of anger is not useful.
There are some people who
endure the death of a loved one
who are not able to get over that loss.
They continue to suffer.
They continue to feel
intense pain for years even,
and that's horribly painful.
It's horribly unpleasant.
It's tragic in many ways.
The person that they've
lost is no longer with us
and they can't move on in their life.
There are lots of different ideas
about what can be done to
help people in that situation.
There are some tools and techniques
people have talked about.
One is actually having conversations
with the deceased person
and talking through what
it is they think happened
and what it is they think their life like,
etcetera, that might
make them feel connected.
It might also help allow them
to get feelings off their
chest that, you know,
maybe anger at that person or guilt
at something they did or
something they didn't do.
There is also, it is very important
to get out into the world.
Even if we don't feel like
getting out in the world,
we really need to get out in the world.
Sometimes just exercising
is very important
because it helps us function better,
helps us feel more alive.
We sometimes need to review what
that person meant in our life.
If we were highly dependent on them
for a certain part of our
life that's very difficult.
But then we need to find a way to develop
that own part of our
life in their absence.
Another big part of it,
which is actually a component
of a lot of treatments,
successful treatments for grief
is to think about how we're
conceptualizing the loss.
How are we explaining it?
And often, I hate to use this
word, but often people have
what are typically called
dysfunctional beliefs.
They're often erroneous beliefs
that somehow we caused the death
or somehow we didn't do enough,
or somehow, you know, the
person died angry at us
or whatever we may be telling ourselves.
There are a number of existing treatments
that actually have
proven quite efficacious.
Many of them use cognitive
behavioral components,
which focus on this core part,
how we understand the loss
and how we understand the loss
actually drives how we react to it.
So getting at that piece of it,
another related part is
actually involves exposure.
And that means talking about
the loss from beginning to end.
The leading up to it, what
happened, and how you reacted.
That one stretch.
'Cause, interestingly, when
we are really distressed
by an event, when we're
really disturbed by an event,
we tend not to think
of it as a whole piece.
We tend to think of it in
little bits and pieces,
images that come to mind.
Unpleasant images,
something somebody said,
something we said, a
visual image, a sound.
Those happen and we right
away wanna push them away
'cause they're so painful
and so unpleasant,
and we don't pursue the entire story.
One of the things that treatments do now
is they ask people to tell the whole story
from beginning to end.
When you're telling that story,
a person who's lost a loved one,
who's struggling from beginning
to end to another person,
especially a person that
we assume is an expert,
we're kind of laying it out there.
This is what actually happened.
And that helps us, interestingly,
it helps us understand how we
are thinking about that event
and how we're placing
ourselves in that story
often in ways that are really not founded.
Like things are usually
not a person's fault.
Now, one of the things I think
is important is this
idea of continuing bonds
because we do have a
continuing bond with someone,
and one of the terms of when
people can't get over lost,
it's often used as yearning.
There's this sort of sense
of I want this person back,
I want them to be alive
and that is painful.
That's what we experience a
lot in the beginning of a loss.
But we have to kind of move beyond that
because they're not coming back.
We can continue to have that bond,
but it transforms into
a bond with the person
who is no longer alive,
but is in our minds.
And I'm personally very
comfortable with having bonds
with people that are dead in my mind.
I don't know what happens when people die.
I don't think anybody does.
It'd be nice if we knew, but we don't.
We really can't say.
So we're kind of free to do it as we wish
with the idea that the
person may be somewhere
we're talking to them or we don't know.
And one of the things we can do
is actually write letters to people,
have conversations with them.
I had a very complicated
relationship with my father.
When he died, I continued
to have conversations
with him in my mind,
actually a lot more than
I did in the 10 years
before he died 'cause I wasn't around him.
But I used those conversations
to actually talk about the past with him.
And it was kind of really helpful to talk
about the things that bothered me.
To talk about the things
that I may have been
misunderstanding or understanding.
And to also ask for him to do the things
as a father that I
would've liked to ask him
if he were still alive.
For example, when I had my own children,
I had a lot of questions about
what being a father is like.
And I asked my father,
as if he were alive,
that allows you to
continue that relationship
fully aware that the person
no longer lives in the world.
Now I did this in my- I
live in a New York building.
I did this in the elevator.
It's an old elevator.
I did it in the elevator, purposefully,
because the door is really slow.
So when the elevator stopped,
I knew the door was going to open
and I could stop talking to the air.
So it's a little odd to
be doing these things
and many people might feel
uncomfortable with it,
but it is one of the really nice ways
we can have a sense of a person.
We can also think about what
the person's life meant to us.
What would they have wanted?
What would've made them happy
if they continued to live?
These are actually very nice
ways to be with a person
and to use their memories
to hold onto their memories.
We can also think about what they
would've liked us to be doing.
I remember there was a quote,
I think Paul McCartney said this.
Paul McCartney had been married
in a very healthy marriage
with his wife Linda McCartney.
And when she died, he
moved on in his life.
And I think he said she wouldn't
have wanted me to suffer
and pine away for this lost marriage,
this lost relationship.
She would've wanted me to move on,
and that's what I'm going to do.
And I think we can think about the person
that died in that way.
They're still with us in a way in spirit,
and we can think about
what they would've wanted,
what they would've wanted
us to do, etcetera.
It's a mysterious thing we're given.
This period of time we have to live
and then it's over,
and we can do with it what we will or not.
