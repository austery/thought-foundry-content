We will start our event now
because it is rare to have this opportunity
to invite Professor Masahiro Morioka from Japan to Taiwan
So we want to quickly let this event start
In that case
later the professor and Super Wai will have more time to share
Well, hello everyone
I am the editor-in-chief Hong Shih-Han from Wei Cheng Publishing
I am very happy today
to utilize this grand occasion of the Taipei International Book Exhibition
to hold this wonderful and rare discussion
Our Wei Cheng published a book around this time last year
This book is called 'Is Not Being Born Better?'
After this book was published, it received a lot of responses
because the question it asks
is actually a concern that many young people have today
The author of this book, Professor Masahiro Morioka
is a professor of Human Science at Waseda University in Japan
For many years
he has been dedicated to research on life, death, and related philosophical topics
So this book can be said to be a summary of his insights after many years of research on this topic
This book tells us that
Originally, a question like whether not to be born
is not only something that young people in 21st century Taiwan are worried about
Throughout history
Europe, India, East Asia have had many people
many thinkers who have been troubled by this question
that is, whether it would be better for me not to be born
or whether it would be better for me not to raise the next generation
such a question
So this book actually tells us to some extent
that we are not alone in this way
After this book was published
it received a lot of feedback
There is one that I find most interesting
which comes from our storytelling-type YouTuber Super Ai
He made a video about this book
and surprisingly got nearly 200,000 views
Even Professor Masahiro Morioka in Japan was very surprised
and didn't expect this topic
Unexpectedly received so many likes from Taiwanese or Chinese readers
So
We happen to have this opportunity
That is I know Super Wry has a lot of questions
After he finished reading this book
He wanted to consult Professor Morikawa Masahiro
Then Professor Morikawa Masahiro
Also very happily agreed to this invitation
He came to Taiwan for the second time in 20 years
That is to participate in this event
Holding this dialogue with Super Wry
Then the activity later
Will probably proceed in this way
I will first finish the opening
Then Professor Morikawa Masahiro will briefly introduce what this book is about
Then the main event is actually Super Wry and
I know that many audience members are actually more familiar with Super Wry than the author himself
If they usually watch YouTube videos
Then Super Wry will have a dialogue with the author
Finally, there will be some time for Q&A
Let the audience ask questions
You can ask questions in Chinese
To that, we will have a signing time
That is, we will be selling this book on site
And it is for this international book fair
A specially made special edition with a book band
There is a photo of the author on it
If you buy this book later
You can bring it to have the author sign it
We will leave time for book signing at the end
So that's about it
Without further ado
Let's quickly make use of this opportunity
To discuss this important issue
That is, our birth rate is already so low
How can our thoughts or philosophy help us deal with this
The issue of not wanting to give birth or why everyone doesn't want to have children
Now let us use the warmest applause
To first welcome Professor Makoto Morikawa to share with us
Hello everyone
Thank you everyone for attending today's discussion seminar
Japanese society, like Taiwan, is experiencing a gradual decline in birth rates
The antinatalism I will introduce today
views the declining birth rate as a good thing
Thanks to this book published in Taiwan, which mentions issues related to not having children
or holding negative thoughts towards birth
I have conducted a very detailed investigation into the history of antinatalism
This line of thinking is called antinatalism
Antinatalism can be broadly divided into two types of thinking
The first idea is that no human should be born into this world
This idea ultimately leads to the conclusion of 'lamenting that one should not have been born'
The second idea is that all people should not reproduce the next generation
The first conclusion derived from this idea
is an individual's lifestyle of not reproducing the next generation
Another conclusion
can be described as a personal assertion
which is to believe that no human should reproduce
If such an assertion is implemented, humanity will eventually head towards extinction
However, philosophers of antinatalism believe that this is irrelevant
Humanity gradually heading towards extinction is the best
The birth of anti-natalism thinking is based on two reasons
First, the first is based on philosophical reasons
To summarize in the simplest way
As long as we are born, we will inevitably accompany pain
As long as we are not born, we completely do not need to experience this pain
So from a philosophical perspective, not being born from the beginning is the best choice
The other reason is based on social reasons
I think it is the same in both Taiwan and Japan
In the current society, giving birth and raising a child
From an economic or political aspect
We often have to face pain and pressure
Conversely, there is also a lack of positive reasons for giving birth to the next generation
Thus, looking at the current situation
Anti-natalism is gradually gaining attention globally through the internet
I myself am not an anti-natalist
In other words, I am not trying to promote anti-natalist thoughts around the world
However, I have indeed resonated with anti-natalist thoughts
My position is as a scholar researching anti-natalist thoughts
And personally, I also resonate with this proposition
Finally, from a historical perspective
The host just introduced a little
Since before Christ, anti-natalism ideas existed all over the world
For example, in ancient Greece
there were a large number of poems born
praising 'not being born is better'
Additionally, in ancient India it was also advocated
that humans should not enter reincarnation after death
or the idea of not being reborn into other species
Therefore, anti-natalism is not a modern claim that appeared out of thin air
but has evolved over thousands of years to the present
Everyone might as well establish this concept first
I have conducted a detailed examination of this history
If you are interested, please refer to the content of this book
This book has fortunately attracted many Japanese readers
I hope that in Taiwan, more readers will also develop interest in this book
The introduction of this book ends here, thank you
I would like to insert a remark here
before the super bias begins
I must state one thing, that is
I personally really admire the professor
He can integrate the different philosophical trends of both Eastern and Western fields
to think about this anti-originism
But
besides that a person like the professor writes such a book
to tell us that this trend of thought has existed both in ancient and modern times across the world
another very complex thing is the so-called exegete
that is, surprisingly someone understood this thing
and interpreted it in a simpler and more comprehensible way
and then let more people see it
That is something I greatly admire
Today we have invited Super Yi
because he made this approximately half-hour short video online
which thoroughly and accessibly presents the key points of this book
to the general readers, even if you just listen to it like a podcast
you can understand this topic in this way
to introduce it to everyone
Therefore, today Weicheng Publishing is also very honored
to invite Super Yi to the scene
to let him base on this video
and interview the author Professor Morikawa Masahiro
Then let's discuss the issues mentioned in this book with everyone
So can we please once again give a warm applause to Super Wei
Well, it is a great honor
To have this conversation with Professor Masahiro Morikawa
When I first read this book
Isn't it better not to be born
I was very amazed
That someone can express Eastern and Western philosophy
In such a simple and straightforward manner
Then I thought I must make a video explaining this book
And after finishing, the views weren't bad
It's almost 200,000 now
Clearly, Taiwanese readers resonate quite well with this topic
So I'll just mention one number
According to last year's Ministry of the Interior statistics
The number of newborns in 2024 is 134,850
The year before it was approximately 135,500
So that's a drop of 1,000, creating a new historical low
And last year was the Year of the Dragon, right
So logically speaking
The Year of the Dragon baby should be more willingly born by everyone
But the result is not, is it
The result is not
The result is actually even lower
So why is it that everyone increasingly does not want to have children
We are very curious about this matter
So I did a vote on my own channel
Everyone can take a look at this picture which is the result of the vote
What are the reasons why everyone does not want to have children
We can see that 54% is economic factors
22% is ethical factors
Then other and 8% is time factors
4% is parenting
And 11% is other factors
That everyone might have other thoughts
Later during the QA everyone can bring it up
Why does everyone not really want to have children now
So I have categorized and calculated all the comments below
And I roughly categorized into five major categories
live
Then, let's talk about anti-natalism from five different perspectives
And by the way, we’ll consult with Professor Muroga Masahiro
On how he would respond to these thoughts from Taiwanese readers
Okay
Then I think first we can make a distinction
That is, there are two kinds of anti-natalism
One is that the environment does not allow you to be born
That is, you actually want to be born
The other is that the environment allows you to be born
But you still do not want to be born
Okay, so this economic factor is probably the first kind
That is, the environment already does not allow you to be born
Then if it’s forced by environmental factors
We would be very curious
About how anti-natalist philosophers view this matter
Because in this book
Professor Muroga Masahiro mentions philosophers
Such as the relatively ancient Buddha or Oedipus
These people are princes
Their families are very wealthy
He does not need to consider economic problems like the ones we have now
Then in the 19th century
Such as German philosophers Schopenhauer and Nietzsche
These people were all teaching in academies
So they probably equate to what we call the middle class today
They also do not really need to worry about economic factors
So these people simply put
He might not be able to understand the troubles of the anti-natalist people in Taiwan now
So I would be curious to ask Professor Morikawa Masahiro
Because this is quite a large group's voice
54% of the voice, oh
How would this anti-natalist philosopher respond to these
Belonging to the labor class and lower class people
They do not wish to be born due to economic factors
Thank you, I have heard many rich pieces of information shared
Before the discussion, I think I must first clarify
Philosophers advocating anti-natalism for philosophical reasons
And the general people who resonate with anti-natalist thoughts
These two should be better discussed separately
First, based on philosophical theory
And the advocates of anti-natalism
Even if they solve material or economic problems
For example, even if they become rich people
They still do not give birth to children
And argue that people should not reproduce the next generation
Their reason is
No matter what kind of world one is born into
Birth inevitably accompanies suffering, this is the main reason in philosophical theory
Reading literature from all over the world can also discover
Many stories and novels that describe wealthy nobles enduring suffering
Anti-natalists believe
A person's state before birth is nothing
There is nothing, just 'nothing'
After birth, the state becomes 'something'
Birth inevitably accompanies suffering
Therefore, the state of suffering that must be experienced at birth
Compared to the 'nothing' state before birth
Complete 'nothing' is definitely a better choice
These philosophers believe that although after birth
One will also experience happiness and pleasure
But no matter how happy, joyful, it cannot offset the suffering experienced from birth.
Compared to the general people who identify with anti-natalism.
There are many differences in thoughts and philosophers.
The general public who resonate with anti-natalism.
Most based on economic conditions, material situations are poor.
Or the reality of wealth disparity, such as lacking power, thus supporting anti-natalism.
The general public who identify with anti-natalism.
If the objective environment can be improved, perhaps there will be a willingness to have the next generation.
Please allow me to take some time.
To introduce a practical example.
Last year, Japanese newspapers extensively reported.
Publishing an interview with a woman in her forties.
She has no children.
She strongly identifies with the claims of anti-natalism.
Interestingly, reading this interview reveals.
Her reasons for not having children are both philosophical and economic.
Firstly, based on philosophical reasons.
For herself, she genuinely believes that not being born is better.
And hopes her child stays in the state of 'non-existence'.
Even though her child is currently not yet born.
But at the same time
she also thinks that if one day she finds a beloved partner
when her economic situation improves
perhaps she will change her mind and have children
This lady simultaneously holds two extreme thoughts
These two thoughts are actually contradictory to each other
and she oscillates between these two thoughts
the difference between the general public who identify with anti-natalism
and anti-natalist philosophers
This real case is a concrete presentation
Thank you for the professor's answer
I think the professor just mentioned something very interesting, which is
that actually, regardless of economic conditions
a core value of anti-natalist philosophy is
that regardless of these social environments and economic conditions
as long as you are born into this world, it is suffering
Then I would like to further ask
what this so-called standard of suffering is
because everyone knows that suffering is a relative concept
Many things you think are painful
I don't necessarily feel pain, ah
Then I see the comments I've organized in my video
Many people talk about what painful points they are unwilling to bear
They say
If we have children in Taiwanese society
What would it be like?
This birth doesn't have sufficient social welfare, right?
And currently, the childcare services in Taiwan are insufficient
And the whole society is unfriendly to children
Taking them out will just be pointed at again
And the entire educational environment is extremely high-pressure
Then you might raise this chaotic traffic situation in Taiwan
Just walking a few steps and you might get hit by a car and die
If the entire environment is like this
Is having a child letting a new life suffer?
Everyone's overall discourse is roughly like this
Okay, then if it's based on what the professor just said
No matter the resources or environment
Being born is suffering like this
I think we can reflect on this point
That is to say
If we are talking about this set of arguments now
It actually may have existed in the previous generation
If you look at our previous generation of Taiwanese parents and elders
The economy of Taiwan at that time may have been harsher than it is now
Now Taiwan is relatively more affluent
In relative terms
We may be living at a better standard of living now
So looking at it from the perspective of the previous generation
The suffering we have in this generation may be less
They may think so
We may not think so
Young people may not think so
But for the previous generation, it may be this way
A bit further back
In the feudal era of China 100 years ago
Or Taiwan under Japanese rule
For them
The suffering we have now is simply not worth mentioning
They were the ones who suffered more
But they will have more births
We on the contrary are unwilling to give birth
This makes me want to ask the professor
Because the concept of pain will continuously change with the evolution of society
So does the philosophy of anti-natalism have a standard to speak of
What exactly counts as too painful
We don't want to give birth
Or is it that just being born means suffering
Because this will seem a little negative
No matter how society is improved, there will still be suffering
So as long as there is 0.0001% of suffering, I do not want to give birth
Or does he have a standard that exists
For example, everyone knows that the welfare in Nordic countries is good
But the welfare in Nordic countries is so good
Young people still do not give birth
So the discourse that is popular in Taiwan now
Says that Taiwan's society is too painful
Many social welfare benefits are absent
So I do not want to give birth
But if you look at the Nordic countries
If Taiwan becomes like Scandinavia in the next 10 years
will young people have children?
I think it might not necessarily be the case
it could be like Scandinavia now
young people still don’t have children
so it might not be such a simple social environment
there might be other value factors involved
so I want to ask the professor
where exactly is the standard for this pain
what counts as suffering?
Thank you for your question
this is a very profound and complex issue
Upon hearing the previous question, I have a few thoughts
I will explain them one by one
First, regarding the philosophical anti-natalist view
currently the globally dominant philosopher
is David Benatar
he said that when a child is born
for example, when a baby receives a vaccination and the needle goes in
during the injection, it inevitably feels pain
Even if it is only this slight degree of pain
he also believes that this is the bad thing about birth
the same thing
another philosopher of the nineteenth century, Schopenhauer
also almost published an identical statement
the thinking of these two philosophers is very extreme
if following their thoughts
the so-called standard of suffering
even if it is very slight, it should not exist
but the majority of generally agreeing anti-natalists
their standard of suffering is not to such an extreme degree
just like what was said super weirdly just now
Japan also faces the same situation
as society becomes wealthy, the birth rate also declines
perhaps this is an inevitable trend with the advancement of human civilization
in terms of Japan
it is in the controversy of anti-natalism
when society becomes richer and more modernized
everyone's lifestyle also has more different options
this way, especially for women
Besides giving birth and raising the next generation
she also has many other choices
such as women from fifty years ago and a hundred years ago
modern women can achieve self-realization not only through giving birth to children
the meaning and value of existence they believe in can also be realized in other ways
therefore, self-realization through giving birth to children is no longer necessary
it is likely that this is the main reason for the decline in birth rates
and it is also a topic widely discussed in Japan
another reason
for Japanese men
compared to the pleasure obtained through sex
there are more interesting things to be interested in compared to fifty years ago
according to surveys, in comparison with decades ago
the frequency of sex among modern men has significantly decreased
and young men will also take contraceptive measures
therefore, the number of children born will naturally decrease
I believe this change is a good thing
therefore, the trend in the future
can foreseeably be
that only those who truly want to have children will give birth, whether it is one or two
This group really wants to have children, society provides support
I think this might be a more ideal system
Thank you for the professor's answer
What the professor mentioned just now is very interesting, which is the aspect of gender
As this society develops and becomes increasingly affluent
Males and females, they start to have different values
I am a bit curious because in the professor's book
It's all male philosophers
There are no female philosophers
I am very curious if there are
Female philosophers discussing anti-natalism
Because we know that the matter of childbirth
A large part relies on women's labor
In English, the word labor
It means childbirth
So if women's labor accounts for such a large proportion
But we do not have any voices from female philosophers
Then actually, we cannot see the whole picture
Like in the comment section of my video
There will be a group of people who are already mothers
They say if you give me a second chance ah
I may not necessarily want to have this child
And there will also be some mothers who say
Although raising children is so painful
But because there are children
Life has some new experiences
So it has both negative and positive aspects
Both positive and negative exist
From the perspective of these mothers' experiences
We actually will find
That this anti-natalist view really has a strong gender resemblance
Everyone knows there is a specific term in Japan
Called this parenting penalty
Just child penalty
Once you become a mother
Your entire life starts to be punished
First of all, after you become a mother
In your workplace
It becomes very difficult to get promoted
When raising small children
Usually are girls women in the second shift
Just after you finish work
You still have to take care of children when you get home
In the entire career development of life
You will feel locked down by this child
So in Japan, they invented a term called parenting punishment
Recently, a book has been published in Taiwan
It specifically discusses this topic
So I am very curious
I want to ask the professor if there are any female philosophers
Who specifically talk about anti-natalism
And discuss this from a comparative female experience
A female perspective
Thank you for your question
First of all, mentioning female philosophers
In terms of research in the field of philosophy
Originally, the proportion of women in Japanese universities is very small
This is a problem that male philosophers have to face
We males in university education
Have not emphasized the cultivation of female philosophers
Currently, Japan regarding how to solve the problem of the scarcity of female philosophers
has also become a topic of discussion
In terms of the current situation in Japan, there are almost no female philosophers studying anti-natalism
Additionally, regarding the term 'parenting punishment'
it refers to women still playing the primary role in parenting
must bear the pressure of giving birth to children
This is the situation in Japan
Among them, some women must work
At the workplace, they must work like men
After returning home, they still have to face the work of parenting
They must bear immense pressure
This makes it difficult for them to cope
Young women see the suffering of their workplace seniors
Witness the hardships of life after giving birth
Develop a psychological aversion to having children
Such situations should not be uncommon
Tracing back to the root of Japan's gender issues
can be traced back to the issues of the imperial system
According to the Japanese Constitution
the Emperor is a symbol of Japan
Other laws in Japan (Imperial Household Law) also state
that the Emperor must be a male
In other words, the representative figure of Japan
can only be male thinking like this
exists in current laws
Modern women face pressure on gender issues
If we want to solve these problems
I believe we must even revise the Japanese imperial system
The scope involved is quite broad
Therefore, changing this deep-rooted problem is extremely difficult
Super biased
Do you have another question to ask?
Because we actually passed time faster than we imagined
Actually, I know Super biased has at least prepared more than five or six questions
So I wonder if you still have time
The last question
The last question
The last question as well
I see many comments in the comment section, probably some people's thoughts
is that I feel like anti-natalist
It actually reflects
that our concept of family and the future is actually beginning to change a bit now
In the past, Chinese families would feel that having more children and grandchildren was necessary
And everyone just finished celebrating the New Year
Perhaps relatives at home would ask, 'Hey'
'When are you going to have children?'
Many parents still hold this kind of belief
But our generation of young people
may already be starting to change their views
Why must there be children
to represent a complete family feeling?
Or to have a sense of the future?
For example, in Western queer or LGBT communities,
they criticize this view as a form of 'reproductive futurism.'
That is, you think that reproduction is a necessity for the future.
Just like in 'Attack on Titan',
when Zeke says: 'Is it again for reproduction?'
This kind of criticism expresses
Now you see the Earth's population has already reached 8 billion.
In fact, the population is already at its limit.
In terms of the load capacity of this environment, it is overloaded.
But we are still continuously reproducing.
So what is it really for?
If you really investigate what is behind this.
Actually, everyone can't find an answer.
Then why not have a group of people say
Why don't we just stop reproducing?
And then we create a new form of family.
What kind of family form?
For example, a very famous posthumanist scholar in America,
There is one called Donna Haraway.
She said do not make children; let’s make kin.
That is, we establish kinship with other species.
In fact, many people are already doing this.
Everyone is raising dogs and cats.
And treating them as their own furry children.
That is a kind of child.
And it is not born.
It is adopted.
And then raise a dog and a cat.
Then it is also a form of family.
It is still a kind of home, but it is not a home produced by human reproduction.
So in that case,
isn't it in a way challenging that kind of
must reproduce and give birth reproductiveism?
So I’m quite curious about how
the philosophers who support reproduction respond to this perspective.
This perspective would say,
we now have 8 billion people on this planet.
If we continue to give birth,
there is actually a certain anthropocentric bias in it.
Why must a family be reproduced by humans?
Why can't it become a family with other species?
So I am curious about the professor's opinion on this.
Because this involves interspecies
as well as issues related to the ecological environment and population.
Thank you for your question.
I share the same feelings with Super Wei.
I have a friend who also teaches at a university.
He and his partner live together in Tokyo.
They couple raise two machines pets
Now machines pets whether in Taiwan or Japan technology are very advanced
Indeed very cute
They can conduct various communications
Can have substantial interactions
Can be very close to you, really very cute
They couple currently have no children
Although I do not know if they will have children in the future
At least seeing their current situation they enjoy living with machines pets
This may also be a kind of family form in the future
Currently in philosophical theory
Human and animal maintain a good symbiotic relationship is also a discussion topic
Therefore perhaps one day in the future
The so-called family relations
May have blood relations, no blood relations
Pets become family members or machines pets become family members etc.
These various different forms of relationships combine into a new appearance of family
In the past, nearly one hundred years ago
British writer Aldous Huxley
Wrote a science fiction novel 'Brave New World'
The future world described in this novel is called dystopia
Perhaps to some extent he is right
In the future world written by Huxley, sex and the next generation's reproduction are separate
Of course, Huxley's dystopia
is a dark, despairing society
This society separates human sexual relationships
from artificially reproducing children for the sake of procreation
These two matters are differentiated
Perhaps this will be the appearance of future life
I think it's somewhat similar to what Super Y mentioned
Well, due to time constraints
Actually, I haven't finished listening myself
I actually know Super Y has prepared a lot of questions
And there may be other audience members who want to ask as well
I will say here
that we can probably only allow one to two readers to ask questions
I see that someone has already raised their hand
Sorry about that
Could you raise your hand again, please?
Okay
Dear friends
Hello everyone
I came to share my expectations after arriving here
which are not quite what I expected
I was actually glad to see that someone has started to pay attention to
concern regarding the crisis in Taiwan
In fact, Taiwan's birth rate is the lowest in the world
Of course, some say it's South Korea
but South Korea has already taken concern
South Korea has already established this strategic plan
to address this crisis
However,
recently I happened to see a document published by the Vatican
entitled On the Dignity of the Human Person
Basically speaking,
the dignity of the human being
is because humans have souls
Human life is precious
All harm to life and destruction of life
including suicide
Including war remarks
are detrimental to human dignity
I feel
From this perspective
this gentleman
Excuse me
Can you please slightly
Ah yes yes yes
From this perspective, I think that
Anti-fertility is against human dignity
So I do not agree
I hope everyone can pay attention to this issue to solve this problem
Indeed, Taiwan's fertility rate is too low
Let us increase our fertility rate
Only then does our country have a future
Only then do each of us have a future
Only then does our society have a future
Thank you all
Uh, excuse me
Friends in the audience
Is there anyone who really wants to ask a question?
Okay, I am very happy to have the opportunity to ask this question.
I would like to inquire,
in the examples discussed by the professor before,
it seems that philosophers emphasize
that being born is suffering for people.
So one should not be born.
Is there another perspective to discuss,
that being born is bad for the world,
so one should not be born?
What the professor explored might be
a very long time ago or in the 19th century.
At that time, the issue of climate change was not like it is now.
I personally feel that
the biggest problem facing the world now is the problems created by humanity.
So I want to ask the professor if there has been exploration
or if there are theorists in the world discussing that humanity should not be born,
because it would be better for the world. Thank you.
Shall we first ask Professor Morikawa to answer?
In that case, Super Y, do you want to add anything to this question?
Well then, let's first ask the teacher to answer
Thank you
I would like to first summarize your questions
Is it because the birth of humans is harmful to other species and the environment
so it's better for humans not to be born
Is there this anti-natalism claim
Regarding this issue
I previously introduced a philosopher named Benatar
Just as mentioned earlier
Benatar pointed out the harm humans bring to the world
and thus opposes the birth of humans
So regarding your question
the answer is that indeed there is such anti-natalism
Regarding another question from earlier
talking about human rights violations
Anti-natalists say this
Everyone has the right to have children
but those who do not want to have children or choose not to have children
do not violate the rights of others
Therefore, for anti-natalists, do they violate human rights
I think most people should believe it does not harm
However, from a philosophical level of discussion, it is a complex issue
Because passing on what humanity has created to the next generation
Holds considerable significant value
And most people also agree with this idea
This issue is not as simple as it seems on the surface
But rather a difficult topic
Super crooked, do you have anything you want to conclude with over there
Because our time today has actually come to an end
That is not getting married and not having children, happy for a lifetime
Okay, not getting married and not having children, happy for a lifetime, okay
Then I am here at the Micro Dust Library
And today's event, ah
I am very grateful to have so many readers listen until the end
Today just happens to be the last event of the book fair
When we actually planned to hold this topic
Ah, when we initially said to do this event
Actually, many people said, hey, you are a bit crazy
Just to choose such a difficult
Such a big problem
Just now, everyone should have felt from the dialogue of the two speakers that
this is actually a bit chaotic,
a problem that cannot be easily resolved.
The issues involved in it,
whether it is Japan or Taiwan,
are actually very complex.
It can even affect the imperial system in Japan.
If you want to change this status quo,
or as the gentleman just now was concerned,
the birth rate has already been so low,
how can we quickly list it as a national security crisis?
However, we need to first prescribe the right remedy,
that is to say, there are numerous factors influencing
why people decide not to have children.
The similar poll that was done just now,
actually has many economic and ethical factors.
We often think that philosophy or thought seems to be a slower thing;
it requires time to accumulate,
requires time to refine,
and yet,
In facing this modern, rapidly changing modern society,
that is, the professor just shared
that some people have already started to enter
the mode of forming a family with robotic dogs.
In Taiwan, everyone might see in the news,
sometimes seeing some even more outrageous
or, let’s not say outrageous,
just even harder to imagine
family or forms of life that were not originally imagined.
This thing
is a symbol of the changing modern society.
Just like the professor mentioned earlier,
some societies are becoming more like so-called dystopias,
the situations described by those science fiction writers in the past.
Philosophers and thinkers,
what they can do is actually like in this book,
"Isn't it better not to be born?" this book speaks of,
they can tell us,
actually, for the past one or two thousand years,
different regions.
Then different eras
different thinkers
They are under the limitations of their own eras
how they thought about this problem
Of course, there are their limitations
Regardless of whether it is Buddha or Nietzsche, Schopenhauer
or today in the 21st century, like just mentioned Benatar
Each of them thought about this problem under their limitations
Of course, it may not be universally applicable
So reading such books actually helps us to also start thinking
How people in the past thought
does not mean we have to just copy it
The professor also said he personally does not support anti-natalism
The key point is that we need to know this thing
These people who hold such thoughts
how they think about this matter
This book also includes the professor's research
and also that extremely offbeat video
and today's discussion
Hope it can help us better understand
If your thoughts are the same as these people's
Very good
Then you can know that there are more people who have the same thoughts as you for actually 1,000 years
But if your thoughts are different from theirs
Then that's okay too
It's just that you at least need to understand
Why there is such a large part of society
Starting to hold such thoughts
Then the hope is that today's lecture
Can achieve a small goal
Then our event today will conclude here
Then shall we all use a warm round of applause again
Thank you to Super Wei and Professor Masahiro Sengoka for the sharing
