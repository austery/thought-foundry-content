Neo-Nazi
 groups,
 ISIS,
 Qinon,
 they
 may


not
 seem
 to
 have
 much
 in
 common,
 but


they
 all
 promise
 connection,
 community,


purpose.
 Are
 those
 things
 in
 short


supply
 today?
 And
 if
 so,
 are
 we
 living


in
 a
 world
 that's
 more
 and
 more
 likely


to
 produce
 extremists?
 Rundown
 producer


Eric
 Bombino
 tackles
 those
 questions
 and


more
 with
 extremism
 researcher
 Ammernf


Amoriso.


I
 want
 to
 thank
 uh
 the
 delightful


Emerath
 Amara
 Singum
 for
 coming
 to
 hang


out
 in
 our
 little
 our
 little
 dungeon


here.
 Thanks
 for
 coming.


>> Thanks
 for
 having
 me.
 It's
 good
 to
 be


back.


>> Uh
 he
 is
 a
 professor
 in
 the
 school
 of


religion
 and
 is
 cross-appointed
 to
 the


department
 of
 political
 studies
 at


Queens
 University.
 So
 we're
 going
 to


talk
 uh
 all
 things
 extremism
 today.
 But


the
 first
 thing
 I
 wanted
 to
 start
 with


is
 I
 think
 at
 the
 tippy
 top
 for
 folks


which
 is
 why
 why
 would
 someone
 uh
 pack


their
 bags,
 fly
 to
 Syria
 and
 fight
 for


ISIS?
 Why
 would
 someone
 join
 an


extremist
 group?
 What's
 the
 allure
 or


the
 appeal?
 What
 does
 it
 offer
 them?
 So,


let's
 uh
 let's
 start
 there.
 What's
 the


first
 thing
 we
 should
 put
 on
 the
 table


when
 it
 comes
 to
 understanding
 the
 the


appeal
 of
 extremism?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 have


grievances,
 right?
 There
 they
 might
 uh


have
 economic
 grievances,
 social


grievances,
 cultural
 grievances.
 Um
 but


not
 all
 of
 that
 will
 immediately


translate
 to
 being
 part
 of
 an
 extremist


group
 or
 even
 finding
 some
 of
 these


groups
 attractive.
 I
 think
 that's
 where


the
 ideology
 comes
 and
 does
 a
 little
 bit


of
 work,
 right?
 The
 what
 ideology
 does


is
 it
 tends
 to
 interpret
 grievances
 for


you
 uh
 to
 show
 the
 to
 answer
 a
 few


pivotal
 questions.
 You
 know,
 it's
 great


that
 I'm
 struggling
 or
 something's


happened
 to
 me
 economically,
 culturally,


but
 who
 is
 responsible?


What
 do
 I
 do
 about
 it?
 And
 and
 what's


required
 of
 me
 personally
 to
 do
 it,


right?
 And
 and
 so
 that
 it
 it
 it
 ideology


gives
 grievance,
 sense
 of
 purpose,
 sense


of
 meaning.
 Um
 and
 and
 I
 think
 that


that's
 kind
 of
 at
 the
 base
 of
 it.
 Um


across
 different
 groups
 that
 we've
 all


looked
 at,
 you
 know,
 the
 Islamic
 State,


al-Qaeda,
 the
 far
 right.


>> So
 there
 is
 this
 quest
 for
 meaning
 that


that's
 that
 is
 one
 big
 part
 of
 this.
 Is


that
 fair
 to
 say?


>> Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 a
 lot
 of people
 say
 quest


for
 meaning.
 Um
 but
 it
 it's
 been
 said
 so


many
 times
 that
 it
 sometimes
 feels
 like


it's
 losing.


>> What
 does
 it
 mean?
 Yes.


>> Like
 but
 that
 is
 the
 fundamental
 driver


for
 a
 lot
 of
 people,
 right?
 I
 think
 it


is
 um
 you
 you
 get
 to
 a
 point
 where
 uh


just
 everyday
 occurrences
 in
 life
 um
 are


aren't
 answering
 the
 more
 deeper


questions
 um
 in
 your
 life
 and
 and
 being


part
 of
 these
 movements
 are
 is
 very


exciting,
 very
 revolutionary
 uh
 very


utopian
 um
 uh
 and
 and
 and
 so
 it
 it
 does


infuse
 kind
 of
 the
 boredom
 of
 everyday


life
 with


>> with
 a
 sense
 of
 purpose,
 right?
 and
 and


and
 and
 that
 but
 that
 has
 to
 kind
 of
 be


grounded
 in
 something
 that
 you're


feeling
 in
 terms
 of
 grievances
 and
 loss.


Otherwise,
 it
 tends
 to
 go
 nowhere.


>> Um
 it
 has
 to
 be
 based
 in
 this
 idea
 that


um
 either
 some
 my
 people's
 culture
 has


been
 taken
 away,
 my
 people's
 rights
 have


been
 taken
 away.
 Um
 socioeconomic
 damage


has
 been
 done
 to
 me
 and
 and
 my
 group,
 my


inroup
 um
 and
 then
 all
 of
 that
 has
 to
 be


reinterpreted
 uh
 with
 with
 the
 with
 the


with
 the
 use
 of
 ideology
 to
 kind
 of
 push


people
 um
 into
 some
 of
 these
 movements.


>> You
 also
 get
 a
 bunch
 of
 buddies.
 you
 get


a
 you
 get
 a
 a
 ready-made
 community.
 Is


that
 a
 is
 that
 a
 big
 part
 of
 this?


People
 are
 feeling
 lonely
 and
 there's
 a


need
 for
 community.


>> Community
 is
 huge.
 Um
 that
 can
 happen


offline
 and
 online.
 Um
 I
 I
 I
 used
 to


watch
 some
 of
 these
 ISIS
 supporters
 uh


in
 the
 online
 space
 and
 people
 always


tended
 to
 dismiss
 the
 online
 community


uh
 as
 less
 important
 than
 the
 real
 life


community.
 And
 just
 watching
 them
 for
 a


while,
 you
 tend
 to
 see
 that
 oh,
 they're


they're
 willing
 to
 take
 risks
 for
 each


other.
 They're
 sending
 money
 to
 each


other.
 They're
 doing
 uh
 they
 have


friendships.
 there.
 Uh
 so
 that
 that


sense
 of
 online
 bonding
 is
 just
 as
 real


as
 the
 offline
 bonding.
 Um
 and
 even
 that


though
 is
 sometimes
 mediated
 by
 ideology


because
 who


>> who
 belongs
 in
 the
 inroup?
 Who
 is
 part


of
 my
 community?
 Well,
 that's
 going
 to


be
 determined
 by
 whether
 you
 agree
 with


me
 or
 not.
 You're
 part
 of
 the
 in-group


or
 not,
 right?
 There
 there
 was
 a
 um
 a


friend
 of
 mine
 whose
 uh
 son
 went
 off
 to


fight
 in
 in
 Syria
 and
 Iraq
 with
 with
 the


Islamic
 State
 and
 she
 used
 to
 tell
 a


story
 of
 how
 one
 day
 he
 would
 come
 home


and
 say,
 "I
 can
 no
 longer
 eat
 from
 your


utensils.
 I
 can
 no
 longer
 eat
 from
 your


plates
 because
 you
 are
 part
 of
 the
 uh


polluted
 kind
 of
 non-believer
 family.


Now
 I
 I'm
 part
 of
 the
 elect,
 the
 elite,


the
 selected,
 the
 chosen."
 Um
 and
 and
 so


once
 you
 create
 those
 boundaries
 between


us
 and
 them,
 that
 determines
 who
 your


community
 is.
 He's
 not
 just
 hanging
 out


with
 anybody.
 He's
 hanging
 out
 with


people
 who
 he
 thinks
 are
 equally
 saved,


equally
 um
 uh
 part
 of
 the
 inroup
 that


he's
 a
 part
 of.


>> So
 to
 have
 that
 meaning
 and
 purpose,
 to


have
 that
 solid
 sense
 of
 ingroup


community,
 does
 the
 outroup,
 the
 them


need
 to
 be
 like
 an
 existential
 threat?


>> Almost
 always.


>> Yes.
 Okay.


>> Almost
 always
 has
 to
 be
 interpreted
 as


an
 existential
 threat.
 uh
 Jamburger
 who


uh
 recently
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 wrote
 a


book
 called
 extremism
 says
 that
 the
 the


extremism
 is
 dependent
 on
 the
 in-group


feeling
 that
 its
 very
 survival
 is
 at


threat
 from
 the
 out
 group.
 Right.


>> Right.
 And
 and
 so
 that
 that
 that
 dynamic


is
 fundamental
 to
 uh
 extremism
 is
 to
 say


that
 our
 very
 survival
 um
 our
 very


success
 is
 determined
 on
 doing
 something


to
 them
 because
 they're
 out
 to
 get
 us.


>> Okay.


>> Right.
 and
 and
 and
 so
 without
 that
 uh
 us


and
 them
 framework
 uh
 you
 just
 tend
 to


kind
 of
 not
 have
 the
 same
 ideological
 um


intensity
 I
 would
 say.


>> Isn't
 that
 lonely
 though?
 I
 know
 I
 know


there's
 there's
 there
 is
 loneliness
 that


can
 drive
 people
 to
 needing
 a
 sense
 of


community.
 But
 if
 everyone
 around
 you


other
 than
 the
 people
 in
 your
 online


space
 is
 is
 not
 just
 someone
 you
 can't


relate
 to,
 but
 is
 a
 hardcore
 them
 that's


an
 urgent
 threat
 to
 you,
 isn't
 that
 an


oddly
 lonely
 existence?


Not
 really
 because
 you're
 you're
 uh
 the


saved
 vanguard
 of
 your
 own
 of
 your
 own


superhero
 movie.


>> It's
 not
 a
 question
 of
 loneliness.
 It's


a
 question
 of
 we
 are
 the
 minority
 saved


elect


>> who
 then
 need
 to
 vanquish
 the
 other
 for


our
 very
 survival.
 And
 that's
 justified


because
 we
 are
 on
 the
 side
 of
 truth.


I've
 had
 so
 many
 uh
 former
 extremists


tell
 me
 that
 when
 they
 were
 deep
 in


these
 movements,
 they
 felt
 they
 were
 uh


heroes
 in
 a
 cosmic
 drama,
 right?
 And
 and


so
 it
 it
 it's
 it's
 uh
 it
 really


galvanizes
 your
 sense
 of
 purpose
 because


you're
 not
 just
 fighting
 uh
 based
 on


some
 boring
 policy
 disagreement.
 This
 is


good
 versus
 evil,
 right?
 This
 is
 a


cosmic
 struggle
 that
 I
 and
 I'm
 a
 part
 of


it
 and
 my
 people
 are
 on
 the
 side
 of


good.
 So
 that's
 an
 enormous
 driver
 for


>> Yeah.
 uh
 for
 being
 part
 of
 these
 groups.


It's
 not
 simply
 that
 you
 disagree
 on


immigration
 or
 you
 disagree
 on
 masking


policy.
 It's
 that
 no,
 we're
 fighting
 for


something
 way
 more
 important
 uh
 and


you're
 standing
 in
 the
 way


>> that
 that
 black
 and
 white
 thinking.
 Uh
 I


wanted
 to
 spend
 just
 a
 second
 on
 it.


>> So
 I
 think
 it's
 fair
 to
 say
 the
 world's


getting
 increasingly
 dizzyingly
 complex.


The
 gray
 area
 is
 getting
 grayer
 and


grayer.
 Um
 and
 that
 can
 create
 a
 lot
 of


uncertainty.
 That
 can
 create
 anxiety
 for


folks.
 So
 does
 extremism
 in
 that
 black


and
 white
 thinking
 is
 that
 like
 a
 way


out?
 Is
 extremism
 and
 this
 may
 sound
 a


little
 weird
 to
 say
 but
 is
 extremism


comforting?
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 the
 the


more
 the
 world
 gets
 uh
 complicated
 uh


you
 know
 German
 sociologist
 named
 Oric


Beck
 used
 to
 call
 it
 the
 the
 risk


society
 which
 is
 the
 idea
 that
 the
 the


the
 world
 is
 getting
 so
 complicated
 uh


that
 we
 don't
 even
 know
 what
 the


parameters
 of
 that
 of
 these
 risks
 are


right
 like
 something
 can
 happen
 in
 Wuhan


China
 and
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 my
 kids
 in


Toronto
 aren't
 going
 to
 school
 right


there
 are
 no
 boundaries
 to
 current
 risks


you
 once
 you
 let
 it
 out
 of
 the
 bag
 it's


no
 putting
 it
 back
 in
 and
 it
 it
 kind
 of


takes
 over
 and
 it's
 all-encompassing
 and


you
 don't
 know
 where
 the
 cause
 is.
 Um,


and
 so
 within
 that
 scenario,
 when
 an


ideology
 or
 a
 group
 of
 people
 come
 in


and
 say,
 "We
 know
 this
 is
 all
 chaos,
 but


actually
 let
 me
 explain
 why
 it's
 very


simple,
 right?
 It
 it's
 it's
 you
 are
 good


and
 these
 people
 are
 bad
 and
 they're
 the


ones
 who
 caused
 this
 um
 and
 they're
 the


ones
 you
 need
 to
 fight,
 right?
 It


creates
 a
 very
 uh
 meaning
 out
 of
 per
 out


of
 that
 chaos
 and
 gives
 you
 a
 sense
 of


purpose
 out
 of
 that
 chaos.
 Um
 and
 so


that
 could
 be
 um


so
 you
 can
 create
 those
 kind
 of
 inroups


um
 out
 of
 that
 chaos
 and
 and
 and
 and


this
 is
 where
 conspiracy
 theories
 are


very
 useful
 and
 this
 is
 where
 ideology


is
 very
 useful
 because
 that
 those
 are


the
 ones
 those
 are
 the
 things
 that
 do


the
 work
 of
 molding
 that
 chaos
 into


something
 that
 um


>> you're
 not
 just
 a
 uh
 a
 victim
 of
 but
 now


you're
 now
 you
 can
 do
 something
 about


it.


>> Control.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 So
 would
 you
 so
 in
 times
 where


there
 is
 greater
 uncertainty
 which
 we


just
 went
 through
 one
 for
 about
 3
 years


the
 pandemic
 will
 you
 see
 a
 rise
 in


conspiracy
 theory
 these
 firm
 handholds


to
 feel
 certain
 about
 something?


>> Yeah
 I
 think
 so.
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 all


conspiracy
 theories
 all
 uh
 or
 conspiracy


linked
 extremist
 movements
 um
 come
 out


of
 some
 form
 of
 chaos.
 Yeah.


>> Um
 or
 some
 some
 form
 of
 event
 that
 uh
 is


is
 beyond
 explanation.
 Right.
 And
 and
 um


academics
 call
 this
 proportionality
 bias


which
 is
 that
 when
 big
 things
 happen,


>> we
 kind
 of
 desire
 psychologically
 a
 big


cause
 for
 those
 big
 things.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 And
 and
 when
 when
 when
 like
 when


president
 of
 the
 United
 States
 gets


assassinated
 and
 you're
 like,
 well,
 it's


just
 one
 guy
 in
 a
 book
 depository,


that's
 not
 very
 satisfying,
 right?
 To


but
 it's
 more
 satisfying
 to
 say
 the
 CIA


was
 behind
 it
 or,
 you
 know,
 the
 USSR
 was


behind
 it
 or
 whatever.
 Um,
 and
 so
 that


similar
 thing,
 similar
 dynamics
 happened


with
 the
 pandemic
 where
 it's
 just
 like,


oh,
 the
 world
 came
 to
 a
 halt,
 screeching


halt,
 and
 you're
 telling
 me
 because
 it


was
 some
 lab
 experiment
 in
 the
 middle
 of


nowhere.
 That
 doesn't
 make
 sense,
 right?


And
 and
 so
 actually,
 we
 need
 a


>> that's
 chaos.
 That's
 chaos.


>> We
 need
 a
 massively
 bigger
 as
 big
 an


explanation
 to
 explain
 uh
 explain
 the


cause.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 think
 um
 or
 explain


the
 event.
 And
 and
 so
 out
 of
 that


sometimes
 you
 do
 have
 conspir
 because


that's
 naturally
 conspiratorial


thinking,
 right?
 to
 say,
 uh,
 who's


behind
 all
 of
 this
 and
 why
 are
 they


doing
 that?
 Uh,
 there's
 always
 this
 kind


of
 shadowy
 elite
 who's
 who's
 out
 for


chaos,
 who's
 controlling
 things.
 Um,
 and


you
 might
 think,
 well,
 that
 should
 make


us
 more
 scared,
 but
 actually
 at least


you
 can
 identify.


>> Yes.


>> At
 least
 you
 can
 identify
 it,
 right?
 And


and
 that
 that
 gives
 people
 a
 sense
 of


comfort
 to
 say,
 okay,
 I
 know
 who's


behind
 it.
 I
 know
 why
 they're
 behind
 it.


And
 I
 know
 what
 I
 have
 to
 do.
 I
 have
 to


wake
 everybody
 up
 to
 to
 the
 truth,


right?
 And
 so
 this
 kind
 of
 thinking
 was


behind
 QAnon,
 the
 QAnon
 movement.
 this


was
 behind
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 um
 pandemic


related
 conspiracy
 theories
 um
 and
 and


and
 so
 on.
 So
 that
 this
 this
 kind
 of


pinpointing
 a
 cause
 um
 and
 getting


involved
 and
 sometimes
 that
 naturally


leads
 to
 extremist
 kind
 of
 movements


because


>> um
 I
 always
 say
 not
 every
 conspiracy


theory
 is
 the
 same.
 Not
 every
 conspiracy


theory
 has
 a
 moral
 component
 to
 it
 in


the
 same
 way


>> as
 a
 call
 to
 action
 almost


>> as
 a
 call
 to
 action.
 Whereas
 if
 I


whereas
 QAnon
 was
 perfect
 for
 that,


right?
 Whereas
 like


>> Hollywood
 and
 the
 Democratic
 elite
 are


are
 are
 operating
 a
 clandestine


pedophile
 ring,


>> right?


>> It's
 it's
 not
 the
 same
 as
 saying
 the


earth
 is
 flat
 or
 the
 the
 moon
 landing


was
 faked
 because
 this
 one
 has
 a
 moral


call
 to
 action.


>> You
 have
 you're
 telling
 me
 kids
 are


being
 enslaved
 and
 tortured.
 That's
 not


that's
 going
 to
 get
 me
 out
 of
 my
 seat.


much
 more
 likely
 than
 the
 moon
 landing


was
 faked
 or
 the
 earth
 is
 flat
 or


whatever,
 right?


>> Yeah.


>> Um,
 so
 not
 all
 conspiracy
 theories
 can


galvanize
 in
 the
 same
 way.
 And
 I
 and
 I
 I


think
 we've
 seen
 more
 and
 more
 uh
 the


nature
 of
 those
 conspiracy
 theories


shift
 to
 galvan
 to
 those
 that
 are


galvanizing.


>> You
 had
 an
 ex
 QAnon
 member
 in
 your


classroom
 at
 Queens.


>> Yeah.


>> Uh
 a
 little
 while
 ago
 and
 I
 think
 one
 of


your
 students
 said
 afterwards
 that,
 huh,


this
 guy
 is
 really
 empathetic.
 How
 so?


Well,
 I
 mean,
 hearing
 him
 talk
 and
 and


and
 hearing
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people
 uh


leave
 who've
 left
 these
 movements
 talk


it


kind
 of
 what
 I
 was
 saying
 earlier
 is


just
 like
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 had
 to
 wake
 up


everyone
 around
 me.
 They
 weren't
 hip
 to


the
 truth.
 They
 they
 were
 asleep
 at
 the


wheel.
 Um
 in
 the
 meantime,
 there
 was
 all


this
 evil
 happening
 underneath
 the


surface
 which
 I
 was
 I
 became
 privy
 to


and
 that
 I
 could
 see
 and
 other
 people


weren't
 seeing.
 Um,
 and
 so
 I
 needed
 to


wake
 up
 everybody
 around
 me
 to
 go
 help


these
 children,
 right?
 And
 and
 and
 so
 I


I
 I
 need
 we
 need
 to
 go
 help
 these


children.
 And
 it
 it
 was
 a
 kind
 of
 um
 it


was
 a
 deeply
 empathetic
 moment
 for
 him.


What
 to
 the
 he
 felt
 helpless.
 He
 felt


like
 he
 uh
 wasn't
 doing
 what
 he
 could


and
 what
 should
 what
 he
 should
 be
 doing,


wasn't
 doing
 enough.
 Um
 and
 and
 so
 uh


it's
 yeah,
 it's
 a
 deeply
 empathetic


stance.
 it
 just
 happens
 to
 be
 based
 on
 a


belief
 that
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense
 and


is
 not
 true.


>> I
 used
 to
 do
 like
 training
 with
 uh
 with


with
 some
 Canadian
 uh
 military
 folks
 and


whenever
 I
 would
 go
 down
 all
 of
 the
 ISIS


fighters
 who'd
 gone
 overseas
 to
 join
 uh


join
 ISIS
 or
 join
 other
 militant
 groups


in
 the
 context
 of
 the
 Syrian
 civil
 war,


millions
 of
 refugees,
 millions,
 hundreds


of
 thousands
 dead.
 Um


some
 of
 them
 would
 put
 up
 their
 hand
 and


say,
 "This
 sounds
 a
 lot
 like
 why
 I


joined
 the
 military."
 Right?
 And
 um
 I
 I


was
 always
 like
 I'm
 glad
 you
 said
 it
 and


not
 me.
 But


>> but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 they
 they'd


captured
 a
 core
 personal
 um
 part
 of
 it


which
 is
 you
 want
 to
 go
 do
 good,
 right?


You
 want
 to
 go
 and
 help
 people
 who
 are


struggling
 and
 suffering.
 Um
 so
 yeah.


Yeah.
 One
 of
 them
 joined
 a
 legal


pro-social
 uh
 mil
 Canadian
 military.
 The


others
 joined
 a
 listed
 terrorist
 entity.


Sure.
 But
 but
 they
 recognize
 that
 at
 the


core
 the
 moral
 thrust
 of
 it


>> um
 was
 very
 similar.


>> Okay.
 So
 I
 wanted
 to
 ask
 a
 big
 and


unfair
 question


>> and
 it's
 it's
 sort
 of
 looking
 at
 we
 I


think
 we've
 been
 nibbling
 at
 it
 a
 little


bit
 but
 it's
 that
 I
 think
 it's
 really


been
 you
 and
 I
 have
 been
 talking
 about


this
 for
 over
 a
 decade.
 I
 used
 to
 as
 a


as
 a
 nervous
 young
 producer
 on
 the


agenda
 I
 would
 call
 you
 up.
 Um
 I
 think


dradicalization
 programs
 uh
 funded
 by


the
 federal
 government
 have
 been
 around


for
 just
 over
 a
 decade
 now.
 Um,
 in
 that


sweep
 of
 10
 years,


in
 terms
 of
 those
 conditions,
 we're


talking
 about
 the
 need
 for
 meaning,
 the


need
 for
 purpose,
 loneliness,
 the
 need


for
 community,
 has
 have
 we
 are
 we
 now
 in


a
 world
 that
 is
 more
 and
 more
 likely
 to


create
 and
 produce
 extremists?


>> That's
 a
 good
 question.


>> It
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 an
 unfair
 question.


>> I
 Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 I
 fairly
 set
 it
 up
 as


unfair,
 which
 I
 think
 is
 fair.


I
 think
 um
 I
 think
 we
 are
 at
 a
 situation


u
 I
 mean
 this
 is
 this
 is
 kind
 of
 very


bird's
 eye
 in
 a
 way
 like
 what
 I've
 been


seeing
 across
 some
 of
 these
 movements
 um


is
 what
 some
 researchers
 now
 call
 like


the
 the
 end
 of
 modernity
 meaning
 it


means
 like
 modernity
 has
 kind
 of
 run
 its


course.
 In
 other
 words,
 the
 the
 promise


of
 modernity
 is


we're
 we're
 going
 to
 you're
 going
 to
 be


middle
 class.
 You're
 going
 to
 have
 a


nice
 house
 with
 a
 picket
 fence
 and
 a
 car


and
 a
 wife
 and
 a
 child,
 wife
 and


children,
 and
 everything's
 going
 to
 be


great.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 peaceful.


There's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 any
 war.
 It's


going
 to
 be
 peaceful
 transfer
 of
 power.


Uh
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a
 pension
 like


all
 like
 that
 was
 the
 promise
 of
 liberal


modernity
 is
 to
 say
 we're
 going
 to
 make


your
 life
 chaos
 free,
 right?
 Um,
 but


what
 I
 think
 we're
 seeing
 now
 is
 the


limits
 of
 that,
 which
 is
 the
 sense
 of
 uh


the
 sense
 of
 flare,


purpose,
 meaning
 is
 all
 lost.
 And
 so


you're
 you
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 a
 lot
 of


people
 are
 fine
 with
 the
 with
 the
 with


the
 white
 picket
 fence
 story,
 right?


They're
 they're
 happy
 in
 it.
 But
 there


are
 individuals
 who
 find
 that
 that


strips
 life
 of
 purpose
 and
 meaning.
 um


and
 that
 you
 need
 to
 kind
 of
 go
 beyond


it
 to
 find
 a
 purpose
 for
 yourself,


right?
 And
 and
 so
 that
 I
 think
 when
 you


say
 um
 are
 we
 in
 a
 situation
 where
 you


might
 create
 more
 extremist
 movements


when
 that
 calmness
 of
 modernity
 runs
 its


course
 or
 there
 are
 moments
 that
 pierce


it
 like
 the
 pandemic


>> um
 which
 uh
 which
 kind
 of
 upended
 our


sense
 of
 normaly
 um
 or
 what
 you're


seeing
 in
 the
 United
 States
 right
 now


which
 is
 all
 of
 the
 wallpaper


institutions
 of
 their
 life
 are
 being


eroded
 and
 people
 are
 realizing
 that
 oh


I
 thought
 we
 were
 we
 didn't
 need
 these


things
 because
 liberal
 modernity
 what
 it


does
 is
 it
 it it
 it
 functions
 very


smoothly,
 right?
 It's
 boring,
 it's


bureaucratic,
 it's
 institutional,
 it'll


give
 you
 whatever
 you
 want.
 Um,
 and
 what


it
 does
 is
 it
 create
 it
 creates
 a
 kind


of
 wallpaper
 around
 yourself
 to
 the


point
 where
 you
 don't
 actually
 remember


that
 you
 need
 these
 things,
 right?
 And


and
 so
 you
 start
 to
 take
 it
 for
 granted.


You
 start
 to
 take
 the
 the
 peace
 and


serenity
 for
 granted.


>> Um,
 and
 you
 need
 a
 kind
 of
 Trump
 figure


once
 in
 a
 while
 to
 be
 like,
 "Let
 me
 take


away
 your
 healthcare
 for
 a
 bit.
 let
 me


>> um
 let
 me
 send
 in
 the
 military
 and
 and


border
 agents
 to
 come
 just
 show
 up
 at


your
 daycare.


>> Let
 me
 talk
 about
 stealing
 elections
 and


stuff
 like
 that.
 And
 then
 people
 say,


"Oh,
 the
 wallpaper
 our
 lives.
 Oh,
 that


all
 that
 stuff
 we
 took
 for
 granted.
 Oh,


we
 actually
 need
 all
 that."


>> Right.


>> Right.
 And
 and
 the
 the
 way
 extremist


movements
 come
 into
 that
 scenario
 is


they'll
 you
 need
 an
 explanation
 for
 why


there's
 renewed
 chaos
 in
 why,
 right?
 And


so
 extremist
 groups
 will
 be
 very
 good
 at


explaining
 to
 you


>> where
 this
 chaos
 came
 from,
 who's
 to


blame,


>> and
 what
 you
 need
 to
 do
 about
 it.
 And
 so


when
 when
 that
 kind
 of
 peaceful
 setup


ends,


um
 you
 you
 there's
 an
 opportunity
 there


for
 violence
 and
 chaos.
 Um
 and
 extremist


groups
 love
 uh
 violence
 and
 chaos.


>> So
 there's
 a
 real
 feedback
 loop
 here,


>> of
 course.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 I
 think
 what


you're
 seeing
 now
 and
 the
 US
 is
 a
 good


example
 of
 this
 is
 is
 um


>> I
 I
 always
 tell
 my
 students,
 you
 know,


from
 the
 time
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the


morning,


>> you
 walk
 through
 maybe
 a
 thousand


institutions
 of
 trust
 that
 you
 have
 no


idea,
 right?
 The
 ones
 that
 are
 keeping


your
 toothpaste
 from
 being
 poisonous,


the
 ones
 that
 you're
 kept
 your
 ego


waffles
 from
 being
 poisonous.
 There's


people
 in
 in
 cubicles
 all
 around
 the


world
 who
 are
 doing
 that
 job
 for
 you
 so


that
 you
 can
 just
 walk
 to
 school,
 right?


Um,
 but
 when
 you
 have
 a
 RFK
 junior
 in


there
 or
 when
 you
 have
 these
 uh


individuals
 who
 kind
 of
 disrupt
 that


sense
 of
 normaly
 and
 and
 and
 and
 clean


functioning,
 it
 gets
 you
 get
 you
 get
 a


little
 shock
 to
 the
 system,
 right?
 It's


like,
 oh,
 now
 what's
 what's
 in
 my
 food


and
 what
 am
 I
 drinking?
 And
 that
 that's


what
 creates
 a
 lot
 of
 uneasiness
 and


chaos
 that
 people
 aren't
 used
 to,


especially
 in
 the
 west.


>> Um,
 because
 liberal
 modernity,
 that
 all


it
 was
 good
 at
 was
 keeping
 it


predictable
 and
 boring,


>> right?
 Uh
 and
 then
 when
 you
 throw
 that


for
 a
 loop,
 uh
 it
 it
 be
 it
 becomes
 a


potential
 for
 um
 conspiracy
 theories,


extremist
 movements,
 uh
 to
 kind
 of
 take


advantage
 of
 that,
 I
 think.
 So
 let's


quote
 George
 Orwell.
 I
 think
 it's
 always


good
 to
 quote
 George
 Orwell.


>> Yeah,


>> we're
 talking
 about
 2026,
 but
 let's
 go


back
 about
 I
 guess
 86
 years.
 This
 is


from
 Orwell's
 review
 of
 a
 book
 called


Minecom.
 Um
 and
 I
 think
 it
 a
 weird
 way


of
 setting
 that
 up.
 I
 think
 it
 gets
 I


think
 it
 really
 gets
 at
 what
 you're


talking
 about
 here.
 So
 um
 the
 fact
 is


Oral
 writes
 that
 there
 is
 something


deeply
 appealing
 about
 him.
 Hitler
 knows


that
 human
 beings
 don't
 only
 want


comfort,
 safety,
 short
 working
 hours,


hygiene,
 birth
 control,
 and
 in
 general


common
 sense.
 They
 also
 at least


intermittently
 want
 struggle
 and


self-sacrifice,
 not
 to
 mention
 drums,


flags,
 and
 loyalty
 parades.
 However
 they


may
 be
 as
 economic
 theories,
 fascism
 and


Nazism
 are
 psychologically
 far
 sounder


than
 any
 hedonistic
 conception
 of
 life.


This
 was
 85
 years
 ago.
 So
 is
 there


always
 been
 this
 kind
 of
 defect
 at
 the


heart
 of
 liberalism
 that's
 maybe
 both
 a


strength
 and
 a
 weakness
 where
 liberalism


doesn't
 come
 packaged
 with
 any
 meaning


for
 you?
 It
 is
 a
 container.


>> It's
 a
 container
 for
 people
 to
 have


freedom
 of
 religion
 in.


>> Yeah.
 I
 forget
 who
 said
 this
 but
 the
 it


was
 something
 like
 um
 liberalism
 will


tell
 you
 how
 to
 live
 but
 it
 doesn't
 tell


you
 what
 you're
 living
 for.
 Um
 and
 that


I
 think
 is
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 that
 quote


too
 right
 it's
 like
 yeah
 the
 if
 you're


happy
 with
 normaly


um
 liberalism
 will
 give
 you
 normaly
 but


once
 in
 a
 while
 if
 you
 need
 the


pageantry
 if
 you
 need
 the
 charismatic


leader
 if
 you
 need
 someone
 hitting
 the


shoot
 at
 the
 podium
 uh
 that's
 not
 what


liberalism
 will
 do.
 It'll
 give
 you
 the


peaceful
 transfer
 of
 very
 boring
 power


over
 decades
 and
 make
 sure
 that
 no
 one


invades
 you
 and
 you
 know
 and
 and
 it'll


it'll
 be
 nice
 and
 quiet.
 Um
 but
 uh
 there


there
 are
 people
 and
 I've
 heard
 them
 on


TV
 now
 with
 the
 Trump
 administration


with
 the
 with
 the
 in
 other
 parts
 of
 the


world
 too
 where
 um
 you
 do
 need
 there
 is


a
 thirst
 for
 kind
 of
 a
 charismatic


leader
 who
 bursts
 through
 that
 boredom


and
 gives
 you
 some
 kind
 touches
 your


spirit
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 that
 that's
 more


than
 just
 um
 this
 kind
 of
 institutional


boredom.


>> Right.
 Um,
 even
 if
 it's
 very
 peaceful


and
 things
 are
 quiet
 and
 stable,
 once
 in


a
 while
 you
 people
 thrive
 on
 not
 chaos,


but
 something
 greater
 than
 themselves
 to


feel
 like
 they're
 feel
 like
 they're


human.


>> But
 why
 now
 then?
 Why
 is
 this
 defect


becoming
 uh
 more
 obvious
 now?


>> Um,
 I
 mean
 that's
 tough
 to
 say.
 Yeah,
 I


think
 I
 think
 it
 is
 it
 is
 a
 it
 is
 an


entirely
 different
 media
 landscape
 and


information
 landscape
 that
 we
 live
 in


now
 and
 it's
 hard
 to
 pinpoint
 where
 that


sense
 of
 need
 is
 coming
 from.
 Um
 there's


a
 lot
 more
 things
 to
 be
 pissed
 off
 about


for
 people
 because
 they're
 getting


they're
 encountering
 and
 consuming
 a
 lot


more
 uh
 grievances
 from
 other
 parts
 of


the
 world
 and
 other
 communities
 which
 we


wouldn't
 have
 had
 any
 access
 to
 before


>> before
 social
 media
 in
 particular.
 Um,


so
 I
 do
 think
 that
 that's
 driving
 a
 lot


of
 angst
 and
 uh
 and
 and
 getting
 people


riled
 up
 that
 way.
 Misinformation.


They're
 they're
 they're
 consuming
 a
 lot


of
 information
 that
 doesn't
 that
 they


wouldn't
 have
 in
 the
 in
 the
 past.
 And
 so


that
 that's
 part
 of
 it.
 I
 think
 maybe
 we


got
 to
 put
 loneliness
 on
 the
 table
 for
 a


second,
 too.
 I
 mean,
 the
 United
 Kingdom


created
 a
 minister
 of
 loneliness,


>> which
 kind
 of
 sounds
 like
 a
 Monty
 Python


bit,
 but
 it's
 it's
 a
 real
 thing.
 Um,


it's
 premised
 on
 this
 idea
 that


loneliness
 is
 a
 public
 health
 issue.


Loneliness
 can
 kill.
 It's
 terrible
 for


your
 physical
 health.
 I
 guess
 what
 I'm


curious
 here
 is
 should
 we
 also
 see


loneliness
 is
 terrible
 for
 our
 political


health.
 The
 lonier
 we
 get,
 the
 more


atomized
 we
 get,
 the
 less
 community
 we


feel
 that
 we're
 bounded
 in
 around
 us.


Um,
 are
 we
 going
 to
 start
 to
 see
 more


and
 more
 things
 that
 I
 guess
 hack
 away


at
 the
 stuff
 that
 makes
 democracy
 work?


>> I
 think
 so.
 I
 I
 mean
 on
 on
 the
 one
 hand


uh
 it's
 self-destructive.
 Um
 so
 we
 might


just
 see
 a
 generation
 of
 young
 people


kind
 of
 whittle
 away
 by
 themselves
 then


you'll
 or
 you
 can
 see
 the
 opposite


reaction
 which
 is
 they
 join
 very
 intense


communities


>> um
 as
 a
 way
 to
 feel
 like
 they
 belong.
 So


like
 whenever
 I've
 talked
 to
 for
 former


uh
 members
 of
 the
 far
 right
 and
 former


neo-Nazis
 and
 stuff
 like
 that
 they


always
 bring
 that
 part
 in
 which
 is
 um


which
 is
 I
 I
 was
 bullied
 at
 school.
 I


felt
 alone
 and
 it
 and
 and
 I
 felt
 uh


attacked
 and
 these
 guys
 made
 me
 feel


strong
 and
 safe
 and
 powerful.
 Um
 and
 so


that's
 a
 natural
 response
 I
 think
 to


that
 sense
 of
 loneliness.
 So
 there
 are


others
 um
 who
 might
 turn
 that
 loneliness


in
 a
 self-destructive
 way
 and
 you're


seeing
 that
 a
 bit
 with
 the
 incel


community
 uh
 at least
 the
 the
 kind
 of


more
 um
 what
 what
 they
 call
 blackpilled


corner
 of
 the
 incel
 community
 which
 they


feel
 like
 everything's
 doomed
 and


there's
 no
 point
 in
 being
 alive.
 But
 the


but
 the
 loneliness
 is
 is
 a
 can
 lead
 in


either
 of
 those
 directions,
 right?
 Um
 or


it
 can
 lead
 pro-socially
 where
 you
 you


know
 join
 a
 bowling
 league
 or
 whatever


and


>> and
 and
 do
 and
 and
 get
 back
 out
 there


and
 and
 do
 something
 in
 society.
 But
 um


I
 do
 think
 with
 the
 amount
 of
 hours


people
 are
 working,
 the
 having
 our
 face


in
 our
 phones
 the
 whole
 time.
 Uh
 there


is
 this
 kind
 of
 veneer
 of
 being
 attached


to
 things
 that
 are
 going
 on,
 but
 it's


actually
 a
 a
 very
 like
 lonely


experience,
 right?
 You
 can
 be
 you
 you


can
 be
 a
 you
 can
 be
 an
 online
 profile


with,
 you
 know,
 100,000
 followers
 and


have
 a
 YouTube
 channel
 and
 all
 that,
 but


you
 can
 you're
 still
 in
 your
 bedroom
 by


yourself.


>> Yeah.


>> Right.
 And
 so
 it
 it
 does
 create
 this
 um


feeling
 of
 being
 like
 you're
 out
 there,


but
 actually
 you're
 we're
 just
 all
 on


our
 individual
 devices.
 That's
 a
 core
 of


a
 lot
 of
 the
 problems
 that
 we're
 seeing.


And
 and
 so
 that
 can
 go
 pro-ocial
 or
 that


can
 go


>> Yeah.


>> that
 can
 go
 sideways.


>> All right,
 one
 more
 question
 on


liberalism.
 I
 promise
 no
 more
 after


this.
 Yeah.
 Um,
 I
 think
 we're
 starting


to
 see
 politics
 becoming
 a
 little
 bit


religious
 for
 people.
 Politics
 as


religion.
 Does
 liberalism
 need


religion
 in
 in
 general
 that
 that
 that


contains
 that
 need
 for
 meaning
 without


it
 becoming
 politics
 as
 religion?


>> I
 mean,
 liberalism
 doesn't
 need


religion,
 but
 what
 it
 tends
 to
 do


sometimes
 um
 is
 is
 create
 civil


religion,
 right?
 And
 and
 and
 so
 uh
 again


to
 to
 name
 drop
 some
 more,
 Robert
 Bella


wrote
 this
 very
 important
 article
 back


in
 the
 whenever
 it
 was
 called
 civil


religion
 where
 he
 says
 America
 even


though
 it
 presumes
 to
 not
 be
 a
 religious


country
 like
 like
 a
 state's
 religious


country,
 religious
 freedom,
 etc.
 Uh
 does


have
 a
 lot
 of
 religious
 qualities
 to
 its


patriotism,
 right?
 There's
 a
 in
 God
 we


trust
 on
 the
 currency.
 There's
 uh
 flags.


There's
 uh
 21
 gun
 salutes.
 There's
 the


the
 the
 worship
 of
 the
 second
 amendment


and
 the
 constitution
 and
 all
 of
 these


things.
 There
 there's
 a
 kind
 of
 civil


religious
 component
 to
 it
 which
 the


practice
 of
 politics
 in
 the
 United


States
 is
 itself
 a
 kind
 of
 religious


impulse,


>> right?
 Um
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 any


other
 country
 really
 has
 that
 except


maybe
 like
 Hindu
 nationalism
 in
 India
 or


uh
 where
 where
 some
 of
 that
 has
 been


fused
 together.
 But
 um
 the
 US
 has
 always


been
 kind
 of
 peculiar
 for
 that
 which
 is


the
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 commitment
 that
 they


have
 to
 their
 own
 founding
 you
 know
 the


way
 they
 talk
 about
 their
 founding


fathers
 or
 the
 founding
 documents
 and
 it


there's
 a
 kind
 of
 uh
 reverence
 there


which
 to
 to
 secular
 figures
 that
 uh


doesn't
 sometimes
 get
 replicated
 in


other
 countries.
 Um
 so
 that
 can
 happen


sometimes
 with
 with
 liberalism
 where
 the


the
 kind
 of
 state
 itself
 is
 sacriized.


Um,
 but
 it
 doesn't
 necessarily
 require


like
 religion
 unless
 unless
 that
 kind
 of


thing
 happens.


>> Is
 it
 good
 in
 Canada
 that
 we
 don't
 have


that
 relationship
 with
 our
 founding
 and


past?
 Because
 there
 are
 some
 people
 I


know
 that
 would
 be
 like
 they
 want
 us
 to


have
 more
 of
 that
 relationship.
 They


want
 us
 to
 be
 more
 rooted
 in
 that


history.


>> Well,
 this
 is
 the
 challenge,
 right?
 Is


is
 like
 we're
 a
 multicultural
 pluralist


society
 and
 whenever
 political
 leaders


are
 asked
 what
 our
 Canadian
 identity
 is,


they
 say
 our
 Canadian
 identity
 is


multiculturalism.
 Um,
 and
 that's
 great


for
 some
 people
 who
 like
 me
 who
 arrived


here
 during
 during
 the
 height
 of


multiculturalism.


Um,
 but
 if
 you're
 kind
 of


nivistoriented,
 if
 you're
 uh,
 you
 know,


if
 you
 again
 have
 these
 grievances


that's
 something
 about
 Canada
 is
 being


disappeared
 and
 taken
 away
 from
 you,
 um,


that's
 not
 good
 enough,
 right?
 Pluralism


as
 an
 identity
 isn't
 good
 enough
 u


because
 because
 it's
 not
 giving
 you
 a


sense
 of
 truth.
 It's
 100
 people
 who


believe
 100
 different
 things.
 Um,
 you're


and
 you're
 saying
 I
 should
 find
 value
 in


that
 diversity.
 Well,
 what
 about
 like


what
 I
 thought
 Canada
 stood
 for
 and
 it's


disappearing
 and
 people
 aren't


assimilating
 and
 they're
 bringing
 their


world
 views
 in
 here.
 Something's
 being


eroded
 and
 we
 need
 to
 reclaim
 it,
 right?


and
 and
 and
 so
 uh
 it
 can
 lead
 I
 think


we're
 seeing
 a
 reaction
 to
 pluralism
 and


multiculturalism


uh
 or
 the
 or
 the
 lack
 of
 sophistication


around
 it
 from
 some
 of
 these
 more
 nivist


groups
 um
 or
 farright
 groups
 uh
 that
 um


that
 that
 there's
 something
 at
 the
 core


of
 Canadian
 identity
 which
 is
 being


lost.


Obviously
 that
 conversation
 is
 not
 over.


Tune
 in
 next
 week
 for
 part
 two
 of
 our


discussion
 with
 Amaranath
 Amarisum
 when


we
 talk
 about
 a
 new
 form
 of
 extremism


that's
 a
 baffling
 researchers.
