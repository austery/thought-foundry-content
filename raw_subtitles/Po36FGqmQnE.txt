When you look at how much the market
reacted, they didn't react that much.
I mean, bond yields went up 5
or 6 bips yesterday on the ten year.
And the stock market is is down 2%.
I mean, it's
it's it's, it's not exactly right.
An earthquake.
And so I do think that,
the market is very rational
and essentially discount
a lot of the nose and look through it.
The day where, the market
is really concerned about something.
The second point,
I think, is the currency barely move.
I mean, I was looking at euro
in sterling this morning.
I mean, we, we we flat as a pancake.
And so the move away from the dollar.
Yes. As,
as a secular trend,
the fact that you want to diversify
away from the dollar mix makes sense.
And you want to have other currency
on the dollar, but the dollar remains
the reserve currency of the world.
Hello, and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Tracy Alloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal.
Joe. It's back.
What's back? It's back.
What's back?
They're back.
No, it was South America trade.
Oh, the sell America.
Yeah.
Various flavors
of what the comeback could have been,
but all seem to be converging at one.
Yeah, I should have been more clear.
So we are recording this on January 21st,
and this comes a day after we saw
a pretty big sell off in the market.
What was interesting about that sell off
is it was a trifecta of U.S.
assets.
So you have the S&P 500 down, bond
yields up and the dollar index down.
Yeah as well.
And so obviously people are talking about
is this the start
or the restart of the sell America trade.
All of this is coming in the context
of Trump's threats against Greenland.
Lots of geopolitical risk.
And I should also just mention
we are recording
this literally at the end of this
discussion.
Trump is due to speak at Davos.
I don't know why we do this to ourselves.
Yeah, right.
So all of this could change on a dime
within like 60 minutes.
But there's a lot going on. Yeah.
And it probably won't change on a dime.
And the reason is because while yes,
it is true that probably the,
you know, tensions
in Europe over Greenland, NATO, etc.
are very important.
Mark Carney having given
a pretty extraordinary speech yesterday.
There's also the Japan element
and the rising bond yields in Japan,
which is related to, you know,
I don't know,
Abenomics 2.0, perhaps with the,
new prime minister and so forth.
And so then part of the story yesterday
and you mentioned the trifecta selloff,
but part of the story yesterday
fairly sharp, increase lately
in, long end rates in the US and, Japan,
the 40 year bond and JGB,
which never existed up until like 2007,
apparently hit
4% for the first time in history.
You know, we were looking at some 4%,
ten year rates, as recently
as October in the US, actually,
maybe even as recently as December.
Now we're closer to 4.3 again.
So like, you know, though,
if people keep thinking like mortgages
are going to come down, etc.,
and not going out looking like.
And so there is a lot going on in terms
of potential theoretical drivers, etc..
But the important thing is
that rates at the long end keep pushing up
and people seem to be avoiding
traditional safe havens.
Well, this is the debate, right?
So Scott Bezzant, in Davos, like a lot of
people at the moment, he thinks the U.S.
Treasury sell off was just,
you know, the Japan effect.
Yeah.
And others
think it's a geopolitical risk premium.
So, you know,
we need to get into all of this. Yes.
And we have the perfect guest, really
the perfect guest.
We're going to be speaking with Manny
Roman.
He is, of course, the CEO of Pimco.
So Manny,
thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots.
Thank you for having me.
Why don't we start with that last question
when you're looking at bond
yields today, how much of that do you see
as the geopolitical risk premium.
Versus just a follow
through from the Japan selloff?
Well, I think I think the honest answer
is it's a mix of both.
But, when you look at
when I was listening to you
and when you look at how much the market
reacted, they didn't react that much.
I mean, bond yields went up 5
or 6 bips yesterday on the ten year.
And the stock market is is down 2%.
I mean, it's
it's it's, it's not exactly right.
An earthquake.
And so I, I do think that,
the market is very rational
and essentially discount
a lot of the nose and look through it.
The day where, the market
is really concerned about something,
you're going to see
a much bigger reaction.
That's the first point.
The second point, I think, is,
the currency barely move.
I mean, I was looking at euro
and sterling this morning.
I mean, we, we we flat as a pancake.
And so the move away from the dollar.
Yes. As,
a a secular trend, the
fact that you want to diversify
away from the dollar mix makes sense.
And you want to have other currency,
you the dollar, but the dollar remains
the reserve currency of the world.
And so I think all of this was a grain
of salt and, and, and, you know, we, we,
we animals in the best possible way
and we look at the screen
and we tend to overreact to what we hear
and so on and so forth.
I was, I was thinking about this
last night looking at the S&P 500.
You were thinking about how you're
an animal looking at the screen.
I was thinking about exact.
I wasn't in a moment of being an animal
looking at the screen last night.
It just occurred to me
I was like, okay, S&P had fallen
2% on Tuesday the 20th.
However,
in the context of an incredible year
and the incredible 15 years
and the incredible, it's not that much.
Nonetheless, I guess it's the confluence
of headlines coming together.
It's like, oh, I'm going to like
pay attention to the 2% down.
But even but, and I take
I certainly take your point.
These are modest
moves in the grand scheme of things.
On the other hand, this upward pressure
that we continue to see
on the long end of curves, setting aside
one week or whatever,
whether we're talking about Japan,
the U.S., elsewhere, like,
what is the bigger story that we're, like,
taking from?
Well, I think I think Japan is quite,
a, quite a peculiar situation.
Okay, let's talk about top Hand.
Let me start with the US
because it's it's the easiest thing.
Look, rates have been essentially
in a range for the past year and a half.
And I think I think the Treasury
and the fed would be very focused
on the long end of the curve.
And I think that fixed income offer
is a really good entry
point in terms of investment.
I mean, we talked about the S&P.
The S&P is very expensive.
Investors are going to look at,
you know, long term fixed income and say,
I can make 6 or 7%
or holding a basket of fixed income
that looks really attractive.
And so I think every time you build back
up, you see money coming back.
You know, I talk about Pimco.
The flows have been incredibly good
over the past 12 months.
You know, people have come and bought U.S.
asset
and and the trend is very is very clear.
Nothing is changing.
And we have people basically
saying I can get, you know, equity
like return using fixed income.
And for as long as that remains the case,
I think the rates
have very bounded in terms
of where they're going to go.
Okay.
Japan is a very, specific situation.
I just came back from Japan last week.
Oh, great.
I mean, you feel you feel bullish.
I think everyone you meet, is
bullish equity.
You know, I started my career in 1987.
It's the first time that I see
the Nikkei above when I started.
I mean, it's it's it's it's unbelievable.
But yes, you know,
there is for the first time inflation
and the get of the curve, is,
is probably going to go higher.
And that's probably overall a good thing.
Now the super secular trend is
the demographic
pressures are a real problem
a real problem.
But the I think one of the thing we try
to do is look at the liquid instruments.
So the 40 year job
may not be the most liquid instrument.
The ten year JGB sure I agree is 40 year.
They're probably hardly trading.
And you know
the same goes in the US right?
I mean you really want to
look at the ten year.
The 30 is a bit of a yeah different story.
You mentioned U.S.
treasuries trading in a band.
And this is something I wanted
to talk about because, you know, before
yesterday, the non movement in the bond
market was really remarkable.
So the move index is at its lowest
since I think like 2021.
That's the bond volatility index.
And if you look at the 30 day
trading range for ten year treasuries
that was at the tightest since the 1970s
which is pretty remarkable.
What has that lack of volatility been like
for a big bond Sharpe like Pimco.
It's a funny thing.
We do like volatility because we see
volatility comes out of far right.
And so we do like the opportunity
to provide liquidity
and add interesting position
to a portfolio for sure.
But we
need to scale up and scale down the risk
depending on what's happening in the
market and depending on the opportunity.
And so we just came back
from a very strong period of performance.
This is going to be plenty to do.
And it may be on them specific.
It may be on a macro trend.
I, I do think that a competitive edge
is not to be able to predict day to day,
what's going to happen to the market
or competitive edge is to have structure,
position, to think about where value is,
to optimize your portfolio,
to think about the downside risk.
You know, that's what we know how to do.
And, you know, it's an interesting market.
Some things are cheap.
You know, I would say rates are cheap
and some things are rather tight.
You know, investment grade
probably rather tight.
But in structured product and mortgages
there's a lot to do.
So you have this environment
where you can build portfolio
and sort of feel reasonably comfortable
that you will perform
over the next 12 to 24 months.
Let's talk about, go back to Japan
since you just got back from Japan.
And actually,
I don't think we've done an episode
on Japan since the election
of the new Prime minister.
But tell us a little bit more.
I mean, why now?
What's going
on? You say everyone feels bullish, etc..
Tell us a little more color
what you learned in your trip to Japan.
Well, I mean, look, we have a
we have a big Japanese
that we have a big Japanese office.
And there are people in Pimco
who knows a lot about a lot about this.
I mean, look, it's a it's it's for 20
years,
Japan has tried to restart inflation.
And, for 19 years it really hasn't work.
And then all of a sudden
they managed to get somewhere
in a labor market which is fairly tight,
where immigration is a problem
and where when you go there,
I think there's a clear desire,
to monitor immigration.
And the new, prime minister,
is, has been very vocal
about making sure that, there's a limit
in terms of labor force moving into Japan.
Now, over the medium
term, that's a problem.
But when you look at the inflationary
pressure, it's pretty clear that there's
more inflation in Japan that it has been
for the longest possible time.
Now the second thing is
I think you see other factors
in Japan
that you haven't seen in a long time.
I was surprised by,
the fact that you have much
more activism in the stock market, people
to try to take ownership in a company.
Yeah, trying to turn them around.
Breaking down conglomerate.
It's not the first time I hear that.
Yeah.
Yeah, but I think this term
is certainly more real than it has been.
And then when you think of the
AI robotic trend, you know, the one thing
Japan knows how to do is to make things
and to make sophisticated,
product and, and,
and I think that all of a sudden
there is a competitive edge
that Japan has,
in terms of a number of stock
which looks attractive.
Forget about whether they price,
you know, right or wrong.
But in terms of business model,
they're quite, they're quite attractive.
Just on the bond sell off.
How much of that is the return or expected
return of inflation
versus Dutch sustainability concerns?
Because this is the other thing
that's been very long running in Japan.
You always hear it's a heavily indebted
country.
Is this, you know,
maybe the bond vigilantes
finally turning their attention to Japan.
So I was I was talking with Rich Clarida,
who is our
chief economist, friend of the pod,
as one of the fed.
And I said to him, I said, you know,
we tend to look, debt to GDP.
What if we look, at debt
to household savings?
And then you realize
for both the US and Japan
that there's just a lot of money.
Yeah.
In the US was the baby boomer in Japan was
savers who tend to not to spend enough.
And if you believe in fiscal policy
and the fact that eventually taxes
will go higher, then I think that
the dynamic becomes quite different.
And you can have higher sustainability
in terms of debt,
because the ability to collect
money is there.
You look at the US, for example,
you know, you could have at some point
in time how your inheritance
taxes, this $80 trillion of wealth
in the baby boomers, eventually
that will go to the next generation,
but it would also go to the state.
And it's a question of how much goes
to the state versus the next generation.
But there is the ability to tax more.
It also comes down, I suppose,
to the political capacity
of the state to tax, because on math
you say, look,
there's tons of private household assets.
We've far more, wealth
than we do have debt as a society.
And therefore it's just
a matter of channeling in the right place.
But you also need the politics to be able,
which actually gets me to a question.
Do you might have put it on the sort
of like CEO of a big asset manager hat?
You know, in
California there is talk about a wealth
tax, etc.
there's talk and,
there's talk in Europe about wealth tax
is there's people talk about, oh, when
like set up my family office or whatever
somewhere in the Gulf and avoid all this.
What do you see on that front.
Do you see money
moving at a significant degree high? No.
High net worth or ultra high net worth
clients
really thinking about where their money
is domiciled in a different way.
So you knew there was something good
about me is that I'm French.
And so I've seen firsthand
the experience of a wealth tax.
Yeah. Tell us more about that.
Well, it turned out to be a disaster
because, the reality is people can move.
And, they decided to vote with defeat,
and they didn't believe
that the government would keep the taxes.
You know, historically, 2 or 3% of wealth.
And they decided to go to Belgium or to
Switzerland and to other places and so on.
So I think the evidence in terms of how
well wealth tax work is quite mixed.
In California,
you can
cross to Nevada and, decide,
do you want to live in Nevada?
God forbid.
But then you have to live in Nevada.
But you got to live in Nevada.
But there are many other places,
and there's anecdotal evidence of people
moving to Austin and setting themselves
in Austin and so on, so forth.
And so I think
one of the thing about the US tax code is
you have competition among states
in terms of where people can reside,
and so on, so forth.
So that, you know, there's many
great things about California.
We based in Newport
Beach, we're happy to be in Newport Beach.
We pay high taxes. It's all good.
But, but do you see into California
or even on like, right now,
are you getting, you know, interest from
are you hearing about high
net worth clients making these decisions
right now or thinking about,
all second hand and all from,
all from the tech industry?
Yeah. And I read the same news than you
do. Okay.
I don't I,
you know, I'll be honest with you.
I never met Larry Page, but,
I understand he moved to to,
to, Texas and, you know, and by the way,
one of the thing we've done really,
really well is we set up an Austin office,
and it's been a great success.
So we have 500 people in Austin.
It's a big business for us.
There's, there's a great university there
which produce a lot of great in, in Stem.
So is aware of my alma mater.
So is it. Yeah. So here we go.
Thank you for saying that.
Here we go.
90% of the graduate from,
UT stay in Austin.
So you're one of the exception because
that was one of the I desert at my city.
Got out.
But it's been a real
it's been a real good thing for us. Yeah.
I want to go back to the sell America
trade and,
dollar diversification
because one of the things
that I think contributed to the atmosphere
yesterday was
we saw a headline about a Danish pension
fund selling its treasury holdings.
I think they
have 100 million or something like that.
Not not mega. Right.
So a drop in the bucket of the U.S.
Treasury market,
but the fact that a pension fund is
saying
we're going to get rid of all our exposure
because things are just too unpredictable,
obviously feeds into concerns about,
again, that geopolitical risk premium.
When you see a headline like that,
what goes through your mind?
Well,
that is an upset Danish pension plan.
For reasons that I think we can
we can understand,
but in the large scale, a thing represents
absolutely nothing. And,
you know, one of the thing
when you, when you work for Pimco
that you see, is country
with high savings rate
and low population Canada, Australia
need the US to put capital to work
because the local market is too small.
So imagine, for example, that
you are one of the superannuation
in Australia.
The reality is
you need the US to put money to work.
You local market is too small.
You're not going to put 50% of your assets
in Asia and Europe.
I don't know.
I mean, I'm European,
there's many things that I love
about Europe,
but the investment opportunity,
may not be as exciting
as as as it should be.
We haven't seen growth over the past
six years.
It's a problem. So,
you know, the other trend,
which is happening exactly
at the same time that we've been
very involved with is the eye buildup.
And the fact that at the same time
you have to sell America at the same time,
you have an enormous amount of money,
coming into AI and data center
and build out
building up a whole new ecosystem.
And that I think will provide
exciting investment opportunity for plenty
of people.
And so you have to wait to, to
and the micro versus the politics.
And, you know, if I was a guessing man,
I think the macro, the macro wins.
Nonetheless, I'm going to still
try to go too into the politics
ish question because we're very flattered
that you come came to visit us here
at our offices in New York City.
But it's hard not to note
that you're not in Davos, right now.
I was there in 2015 and I got a flu,
so I vowed to never go again.
What's your excuse?
My my excuse is I think I mean look I,
I always, my pundit, Dean Iverson,
who was on your pod.
Yeah, a month ago.
And I look at life
or life belongs to a client.
We here we are to manage the firm.
We're here to sort of.
I think in Davos. Yeah.
This is what they
this is why a lot of them are saying
oh I go to Davos
because this is where my clients are.
Networking. Yeah. Networking.
Why is Jamie Diamonds there.
He would say my clients are here.
I got to meet with them.
See what your simple people we
we we mind the shop.
We mind the shop.
And look I people make different decision
and so on and so forth.
And I
given what's happening in the market,
given everything else, I think we're glad.
We're glad we in the office.
I love being in the office.
That being said, Tracy wrote
about this yesterday in our newsletter.
You know, it's hard
the the the conversations
that are happening in Davos,
they're pretty serious.
I mean, Mark
Carney talking about this sort of it's
time for us to not be a rupture.
It's time to us to not
we can't be nostalgic about
how the world was five or 10 or 30 years
ago, etc., but it's hard.
Markets don't like when we like,
markets don't easily
pricing geopolitical turning points.
Or when they do
it tends to be in an L-shape, etc.
surely early thinking about these things
all the time and look,
Mark Carney is a friend
who used to be on a global advisory board.
I think he's a fantastic human being
and a great prime minister for Canada.
But I will read the transcript of his,
of his of his speech at the same time.
You will.
Yeah.
And I understand the predicament
that the question is
how much Canadian bonds do I want to own
and how much do I want to own?
And, you know, information is very,
very efficient.
I and the reality is, is my access to
everyone at the same time, what he thinks.
And that's the way it should work.
How do you actually factor
in geopolitical risk into the way
you manage your portfolios?
Because there seems to be something
that investors understandably struggle
with, especially since
a lot of the outcomes are so binary.
Right.
It's like, well, either
the US takes over Canada
or the US doesn't take over Canada.
And I think, I think we
we try to be incredibly humble and say,
why do we have an edge?
And the reality is,
if the three of us sees
the exact same thing at the same time,
we don't have an edge.
I think we really, really try
to understand politics.
We have one of my partner, David Cantrell,
is solely focused on US politics.
She does a great job.
We we care, but we care about macro issues
that may not make it to a part.
We care about mortgage reform.
We care about.
Yeah, you know what?
Actually, what can the president
do in terms of Greenland?
The reality is he needs two thirds
of the Senate and Congress approval.
That sort of seems like a lot, you know,
so so we care about smaller things.
And often we said, look, we we don't know
anything that the market doesn't know.
And so we shouldn't
build position based on on politics
because the reality is, is we always see
the same thing at the same time.
And in some markets, you know,
I come back to currency.
Yeah.
I mean you look at the big currency, it's
the most efficient market in the world.
I mean, I mean, if you look statistically
the incredibly hard to predict
I mean, you look at you
look at time series of,
you know, dollar yen, a dollar,
studying a dollar, a euro and so on.
I mean, it is it is as close to white nose
as anything can be.
So you build a portfolio. Yes.
There is a theme
that the dollar may get weaker,
in which case
you want to have other currency.
You know, we like the Australian dollars.
We like, we like,
we like, you know, the British pound. Why?
Because the economy is slowing down
and you have high rates.
And so there's plenty of room to cut.
And you said to yourself,
that's something you want to own,
but you know how much of your portfolio
it is 20, 25% something like this.
It's going to be 100.
What do you make of
the relentless bid in gold?
I, I am honestly,
there's things where I just give up.
And I said, really?
And I said, I don't understand.
That's one of them.
Really? Yes, totally.
I see more, well,
I believe that assets are being moved
by two factor valuation and momentum.
So the momentum in gold
is incredibly strong.
I see it goes up every single day.
Someone is buying it.
Maybe it's CTA.
Maybe it's individual,
maybe it's central bank.
I don't know, what I don't understand,
I stay on the sideline.
But as I'm talking, I don't really
understand crypto, and that's okay.
Yeah.
I think, you know,
when you when you're in asset management,
the one thing you need to know
is sort of stick to your knitting
and do what you know how to do.
And when you don't understand, sort of
said, okay, that's that's not my my gig.
I shouldn't be doing this.
Other people, other people understand
it better than I do.
I think
you gave us a very polite prompt earlier
to talk about mortgages
and mortgage reform, and we should do that
because I know that Pimco has been
very bullish on mortgages recently.
I see a Bloomberg headline
just from last week saying Pimco sees
mortgage rates easing on Fannie
Freddie purchases.
Those are part of the Trump
administration's efforts
to bring down mortgage rates.
But, of course, at the same time,
you know, we started out this conversation
talking about the 30 year yield,
which is ticking up.
How are you thinking of,
I guess, those two tensions in the market.
So the efforts on the political side
to bring rates down versus bond yields,
longer term bond yields that seem to,
you know, be pretty stuck at high levels.
That's right,
that's right.
Look, I.
It's a complicated tension
and the
if you put yourself into the shoes
of the US administration, what looks
clear to me is you want mortgage
rate to be lower rather than higher.
And for that,
part of it you control and part of it
you don't.
And it's inflation expectation.
It's the shape of the curve.
And it's discipline.
And whether they get there or not
I don't know
is the is the is the short answer
mortgage.
You know, 30 year mortgages
and the whole mortgage ecosystem
looks cheap and there's plenty to to buy.
And it looks attractive. Yes.
We do think that,
you know, the purchase will help,
in terms of attrition, but,
I don't, you know,
I don't know what I don't know.
You have midterm coming in November.
You know, it's too early
to have any intelligent thing to say.
One of the things
that we heard last night,
or one of the things that we've heard
over the past several weeks,
the administration wants to make it harder
for big asset managers
to buy single family homes
that might have something
to do, to actually do anything like that
might have to go through Congress.
But we did get an order last night
or a statement last night
from the white House talking about Fannie
and Freddie putting bigger constraints
on large institutional investors.
Like, what do you make of some of these?
I don't know, populist inspired impulses
to sort of change the,
the, the distribution of who could buy
what assets.
Not much. Okay.
What is the is the is the honest.
Well, I mean, look,
you know, we don't do that, but there is,
you know, some people do built around.
Yeah.
You know, and they,
they said build to rent did.
So I think that's already a pretty big
chunk of like what this whole phenomenon.
Yeah.
And and look it's hard work and it's,
it's, it's you know can can the
the US if you look at it from a macro
standpoint has a shortage of house.
Right. So we need more homes.
And the, the reality is
when you look over the 30 year period,
the only places where costs haven't gone
down is building, you know,
and the reality is we need more cheap
houses, especially in affordable housing.
And that's a policy
that I think would be quite good.
But it's not because,
you know,
institution, shouldn't own single house.
You need more houses.
You need people to be able
to afford proper houses.
And that's true,
I think, in a lot of state
and, states
that, you know, Texas, for example,
where you have plenty of space
and you look at the cost of housing
and it's going down.
And you have, you know, states like
California where it's really complicated.
You need the robots to build houses.
That's right.
So, okay, speaking of robots, AI has come
up a couple times in this conversation.
One of the interesting things
that's happening
in the credit market right now is that AI
is becoming a much bigger force
when it comes to investment grade debt.
So lots of big companies issuing
even more into that particular market.
How does that change the credit market,
if at all, for you?
How are you thinking about the increased,
I guess, exposure or presence of AI in
something like AI, IG well,
I think you reported
we try not to talk about single positions,
but you reported
that we got involved into a very large, 20
plus billion
dollar transaction
for, to build data center. And,
some of these deals are going to be
incredibly attractive and some won't be,
and so I think we
I think what's really interesting
is the big data center.
User may actually be a better rated
company.
And so,
Oracle or MIT, or
any of these company
actually have a capital structure
where they may need a lot of money,
but the money is backed by market cap.
If you use a merchant model,
which is, you know, above $1 trillion.
And so they're pretty safe investment.
And so that's pretty unique.
And so size is a competitive edge
that plays well to our strength.
And so we position myself to have plenty
of capacity to do it if and when it comes.
And then some people like Microsoft
and Google
probably can do it with their cash
and build up their cash
and don't need to issue debt
to be able to do it.
So different
people will go with different, strategy.
My understanding is
you made a pretty chunky return
already on that data center deal.
And I've heard in the market
that since since you did that,
everyone wants to come in
and finance data centers.
Are you seeing a lot of copycats
or competition in the space
to get on these new deals?
Well, not everyone can take
$25 billion of a deal. True.
And so I always say, you know,
one of the thing
was that we constantly think about is
what's our competitive edge.
And we big.
So and we do one thing.
We do fixed income in all shapes and form.
And so we always say we're
going to make money where strength all.
And that's clearly one of strength.
It's good to be Pimco
when it comes to new issuance.
It's it is good to be Pimco
when it comes to new issue.
Where we were part of the structuring
working was, in this case, Morgan Stanley,
and we understood the credit quite well,
and it was something which fit
into a portfolio.
It may be it may very well
be that the next one doesn't fit
into what we do,
in which case would pass, and
returns to scale or such a common,
such a common theme in our discussions
last night, size per se,
as a competitive advantage,
we should not always the case
because sometimes you like to narrow
or small and nimble, but it seems like in
many of these things we're talking about
these days, size is huge.
You know,
just like from the perspective of CEO.
And, you know, this conversation
sort of blends the line of like,
what I would think of as a CEO discussion
and CIO discussion, right?
When we're talking about rates, it's
a CIO discussion
where we're talking about
where you have offices.
And also there's kind of a CEO discussion.
But from the perspective of CEO,
like we're you're
also you putting your chips.
Besides you mentioned Texas
and there's okay there's some migration
Asia I think Asia I think I think
all the high growth market from a CEO
standpoint is quite interesting.
So we have a great Asian business.
And when you look at the population,
the savings rate
and what it will be ten years from now,
I think it is incredibly important
that we do extremely well in Asia.
And so we have offices in Japan,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Australia,
and they're doing great.
And the build up of wealth,
is really, really important.
And that's
before we start talking about China.
And so if you use it,
if you look at the supercycle, horizon
Asia will become significantly bigger
than Europe in terms
of the amount of money for asset manager
and what your opportunity set is.
And I think that's pretty clear to me,
due to mainland
China ever being a real big opportunity.
I hope so, I hope I hope
the market, the market off for a level
playing field at some point in time,
and something that all of us
feel comfortable investing in.
What would make you feel comfortable?
Is it just the easing of capital controls
or using a capital controlled,
rules in terms
of setting up proper trading operation?
All of these things, and,
and, and, you know, you can, always say
you can break the world differently.
So you look at our business. Yeah,
I can break it and say
you have high growth region,
Middle East, Australia, Canada, Asia,
where they all have the same, the same,
characteristics.
They have high growth,
and high savings rate
and do that, you know,
usually pretty good for asset manager.
Yeah.
But then you have mature market
like us in the UK
where you'd be happy to grow at 5%.
Because, you know, there's
nothing really new happening.
And the market is the market.
You may take market share
and you may lose market share,
but the secular growth in the markets
is is sort of well known.
And what about in the Gulf?
I think the Gulf is very exciting.
I mean, I always make this joke,
if you close your eyes
and you take a direct plane from L.A.
to Abu Dhabi, so,
as you know, in Newport Beach.
Yeah.
Honestly, you you think you think you want
to run the world and kind of come back.
Abu Dhabi is the LA of the world. Is it?
It's very similar to Newport Beach,
actually.
People are super friendly.
They've done a really, really good job,
super friendly, great weather
and the most interesting culture
and intellectual hubs
that you can think of it Abu Dhabi
and Newport Beach,
I mean, Abu Dhabi, Abu Dhabi is I mean,
once again over the supercycle,
you know, trend.
I think the Middle East
has come a long way.
And I think you you also had
you have a new generation of,
of investment professionals,
locally trained and locally raised,
which is pretty good.
And so, you know, once again,
that's I think that's quite good.
You know, and then there's
what we don't know, you know, everything
happening with Iran and whether Iran is,
is something will happen or not.
And you know,
I think the honest answer is no one knows.
I, lived in Abu Dhabi for two years,
and I always likened it to Texas
in that it's hot all the time,
and you spend a lot of time,
a lot of your time at the pool and at the
shopping mall, and that's pretty much it.
Oh, that could be,
that could be California.
Exactly, exactly.
Since we're on sort of CEO,
executive level topics, just on AI,
this is a question
we've been asking a lot of our guests,
but how are you incorporating AI,
if at all, into your own workflow
and organization?
Oh, I think we I think for us
the sort of defensive
and offensive opportunity. So,
the defensive one, it should increase
significantly productivity
in terms of everything we do from,
the way we manipulate document,
the way we create
marketing, the way,
we optimize our trade function.
I mean, remember, every time we buy a
bond, it goes into many different account,
and every single account has different
parameters, different restriction.
It's all goes to a custodian.
It gets split.
It has based X.
All of these things
is a complicated factory.
Anything which makes the factory simpler,
more efficient
and safer is a really, really good thing.
I would help to do this.
We spend a lot of time discussing and
and things like this where honestly,
it's probably fair
to say that we have better things to do.
And so if I get this to a more
efficient and less costly,
solution, that's good.
Always say if I allows us to reallocate
resource more in R&D
than in repetitive manual function,
that we don't need to do, that's good.
I think compliance will also benefit
quite a bit from,
AI and due to do deep learning and sort of
figure out whether the trend, whether
we miss something, whether, you know,
look at every possible situation.
I think that's also quite good.
And then there's the offensive part
where you sort of sit, okay,
can I use,
a large language model
to try to extract from data
inside an opportunity
that I may have missed?
And I think on this, some of it will say,
okay, that doesn't work. Yes.
You know, we've analyzed,
every single sentence from the fed
and every single, transcript.
And, you know, we found nothing that we
we didn't know.
And then sometimes we may,
we may find things
that, are new and others
to have an additional alpha and,
I do think that
large language models
have a competitive edge
when you have a lot of data, which don't
necessarily match perfectly.
So when it's, you know, in the mortgage
market, you have your house,
your mortgage, your credit score,
a picture of your house, your insurance,
your employment history, your
communication with your mortgage provider.
All of these things,
I think should give us
a finer assessment
in terms of what's happening.
And then the more data you have,
the more of an edge presumably you get.
But I think you, I think you and walking
through this journey of being humble
and sort of hope
that, you know, you'll have a few in
just under, I suppose, defensive.
Because we just recorded an episode
talking about some of the coding models
and one of the and there's a huge theme
in the stock market specifically,
lots of sort of
mid-level enterprise
software companies getting very hurt
because their clients are like, oh,
maybe we could buy this, or maybe the AI,
we don't need to like
put in a sales ticket into a system
because you can have an AI there.
Just knows that.
Tell the salesperson to make a call, etc.
on this sort of basic
blocking and tackling.
And an asset manager
must have tons of third party enterprise
software contracts
and seat negotiation, etc.
at that level.
Do you see AI tilting the playing
field and said, you know what,
maybe we could build this feature
trivially and we don't need to pay
this seat, license or anything like that.
Are you seeing this in action?
I think you're
totally right. I think that,
all of us have apps that we use
and software
that we use, that we don't love,
and that cost too much money.
And we'll try to replace them.
In some of them you'd be able to replace
quickly, and some of these would,
but that's an effort.
There's like that's a real thing.
In-house development.
Is that something you're doing already?
So interesting.
And I think, to link that back
to the market.
Sure.
There's been
quite a,
quite a high level of activity
in private equity
in software
because cash flow was deemed to be
predictable, was high leverage.
It would be interesting
to see what happened
to the returns of this software company
for the years to come.
There'll be winners and losers,
but the top line of some of this software
company would be interesting.
And I know that Dan is worry about
the software industry in terms of risk.
And every single credit we own, we look at
it was an 11th and say,
if AI is as game changing
as we think it is, what we did,
what would it do to this business model?
And I think that's a perfectly reasonable
question.
In terms of what what it may do.
You mentioned the fed, a little earlier,
and I realize we've gone
this entire conversation
without actually talking
that much about the U.S central bank.
But let's rectify that now.
So one of the remarkable things
about the bond market recently is
even though there have been concerns
and headlines around central bank
credibility and possibly, Powell,
you know, coming under criminal indictment
and all of that,
the bond market
hasn't really reacted that much.
Again, it's been trading in a very narrow
range.
We've also seen tips and other inflation
related bonds basically not incorporating
any of what you would think
would be these political risks.
Do you worry at all about credibility
of the central bank as a big bond buyer?
I think we are.
I think we believe in fed independence.
And as we often say,
I haven't met many politician
who wants higher rate.
And so this two level in economic policy,
there's monetary and fiscal.
You want the fed to be in charge
of monetary policy.
And I think the good news is
whoever gets the job
as head of the fed enters
into the history book.
I think the
the weight of the function is such that
people tend
to make very rational decisions.
It doesn't mean that
they're always the correct one,
but you're not going to see a situation
where was a reading of inflation
did make a totally suboptimal decision
for a political reason.
I think it's you know,
we're far from that.
I think it's very hard to do. Okay.
And you have a voting process.
I think what you chief
economist tells you, you crazy.
It's just really difficult
to kind of go against this.
No one, you know, maybe
once you can kind of
look through the data and say,
I do think the data are going
to become better. Here's why.
But it's a really, really dangerous game.
Also, once you lose credibility,
you really lose credibility.
Yeah. I, I often say,
I think everyone has looked, at
the least US situation in the UK.
And when you do something
borderline crazy in literally five days,
you can destroy your credibility
in the bond market and you have to move
at the speed of light.
And with the Bank of England
to be able to correct,
when rates go up, literally 100 pips.
And so and so I do think they,
the market punishes you and punishes
you really hard
if you try to do something which,
which it doesn't want.
All right.
Last question for me,
because you mentioned Liz Truss.
Why is it that, Liz Truss is like, okay,
this was like a dangerous thing.
She was like reckless, etc..
Whereas new Prime Minister of Japan
comes in, takes talks
about Reflationary policies.
And you describe as like
everyone is excited about Japan right now.
What is the difference between
the inflationary impulse
that Liz Truss was expected to have,
accelerated with the mini budget versus
maybe the more benign reflation
that you're mostly describing as a sort
of positive development in Japan.
What I think I think what happened
is she gave this whole tax package
at the same time.
So she wanted, you know,
there was like this liberalization
and dismemberment tax package where
clearly someone had to kind of figure out
the the very basic math in terms
of what it did
to, government, government spending.
Yeah.
And then all of a sudden
you had a huge deficit that the market
so and say,
oh my God, there's no way you can do this.
This is not realistic.
And, and the back
end of the curve just went crazy.
I mean, at some point in time,
fiscal policy really, really matters.
And and you know, look, I, you know,
one of the thing about being European,
as is, is you look at fiscal policy
quite a bit because that's that's been
one of the core, lever of,
of, economic policy.
And, and somehow I think,
I think the left hand in the right hand
forgot to talk to each other.
And they came up with a package
which made no sense and clearly hadn't
been blessed by the UK Treasury.
And, and, and the market reacted
incredibly strongly to that.
I'll ask one more question, which,
you know, I think when it comes to Pimco,
I think it's often underappreciated
how much of Pimco
is about those sort of overlays
on top of the fixed income positions?
And so I have to channel my inner
Bill gross here and ask,
are you selling volatility
into this particular environment?
Well, I think, I think we I think we look
at volatility all the time.
And I think when,
when we find opportunity to sell
volatility, we do and it's sort of unfun.
I think we've done it for a very long
time.
And, you know, sometimes we sometimes
we think it's attractive and sometimes
we think it's less attractive.
And we you know, I'm
not going to talk about a position, but,
but it is it is a source of risk premium.
And I think, I think we,
we focus on it, I think we to kind of
come back to this, we hit single.
Right. And I think what makes
up performance is really
the work of 300 people on the day,
never seen.
But we hit a lot of single. Well.
And when you put all this single together,
the result is pretty good.
The great man
coming down from the mountain
and thinking that
all this great macro trend
are going to happen,
that doesn't quite work.
It's it's really about being
incredibly disciplined and essentially
making a bit of money every single day was
various different hello to ever.
And maybe I demystify what,
what we do, but I think
I think it's actually a lot of work.
And this is why it works
and it's repeatable.
You know, I always said to a fund manager,
why do you think you can make money?
Question number one.
Question number two, why is it repeatable?
Why do you think you can do it again?
And the great idea and the great
man coming from the mountain,
I was the table of the lows.
I'm not entirely
sure it's that repeatable.
Because sometimes
you get lost in a burning bush
and you know, other things and so on.
And these are very evocative images.
Yeah.
I, you know, I'm
an evocative guy and, and,
and I do think repeatability is, is, is
is really, really important.
You want to make the process
as industrial as possible
and sort of said, okay,
those are all the level I have.
And on average
this is going to be pretty good.
All right.
Manny Roman, thank you so much.
Thank you for coming
on. It was a real pleasure.
It was fantastic.
Thank you so much.
Joe, that was a really enjoyable conversation.
And I like, straddling
the CEO and CIO world.
So it was interesting
to get that perspective.
You know, one thing I saw right
before we recorded this episode,
people were talking about the Bank
of America Global Fund Manager survey.
Oh, is that out today?
I don't think it's out,
but in the last one, relatively recently,
I think geopolitical conflict top the
list, which, you know, kind of expected.
But then the second concern,
the second biggest concern
was a disorderly rise in bond yields.
Interesting.
So like 19% of respondents had that down
as their like top tail risk in January.
That's pretty interesting to me.
And the atmosphere
feels a little bit different
because people are so primed
for this particular event.
Totally.
You know,
the thing that I keep thinking about
is we just have this combination
right now of like, all right.
So like and we've had
we didn't ask Manny this directly,
but it's like the fundamental question,
why does the neutral rate appear
to be higher than it used to be?
Right.
And there's two big things going on,
which is there's
a lot of public spending
because of re militarization.
And that's related to geopolitics,
this desire for national self-sufficiency
across a range of technological
and commodities and so forth.
So there's like tons of spending and we're
throwing sand in the gears of trade
so that spending is less efficient than it
otherwise would have been.
Right.
So for a dollar of spending,
maybe only 75%
is actually contribute to the economy
and 25% is waste, etc..
So these are two things going on at once.
And so like I certainly take Matthew's
point and I think it's totally right.
There's a you can't one day you get a blip
and it's like it's
not the end of the world.
And you have to like train yourself
to, like, not overthink a single day.
On the other hand, rates around the world
remain despite rate cuts, etc.
and despite arguably slowed down
significantly above where they were
the direction of travel.
There's a broader direction of travel
that strikes me is very intuitive,
given the the simultaneous phenomena
of like less efficient
trading systems and more spending.
All right.
I see Trump is,
giving his address at Davos.
So shall we leave it there?
The the another man from the can I just
say I loved man is like man of the moon.
I feel in finance
we're always talked about men
of the mountain
coming down with their wisdom. Yeah.
So I love that, but yes, we should go.
Listen to a man literally in the mountain.
Lots of mountain men in Davos
and hear what he has to say.
All right, let's leave it there.
