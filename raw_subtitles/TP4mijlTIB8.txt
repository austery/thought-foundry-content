Good
 morning
 everybody.
 Welcome
 back
 to


another
 episode
 of
 the
 market
 open.
 It


is
 Friday,
 December
 12th
 and
 we
 are


live.
 We
 are
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 week,
 the


official
 second
 week
 to
 end
 out


December.
 We
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about.
 We


got
 some
 Nvidia
 headlines
 this
 morning.


We
 got
 some
 Broadgum
 headlines.
 We
 got


Goulsby
 from
 the
 Fed
 who's
 speaking.


Bunch
 of
 things
 that
 have
 happened
 over


the
 past
 couple
 of
 hours
 as
 well,
 which


is
 why
 you
 probably
 saw
 the
 S&P
 500
 get


a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 spike
 in
 the


pre-markets
 based
 on
 some
 of
 this
 Nvidia


news.
 And
 then
 obviously
 Broadcom


earnings
 yesterday
 were
 pretty


important.
 So,
 we'll
 talk
 about
 that
 and


go
 deeper
 into
 uh
 into
 what
 has
 happened


over
 the
 past
 24
 hours.
 Trump
 made
 a


bunch
 of
 announcements
 yesterday
 around


AI
 related
 executive
 orders.
 So,
 we'll


talk
 about
 that.
 Essentially,
 a
 new


framework
 for
 how
 to
 think
 of
 AI.
 Um,


and
 we've
 got
 a
 bunch
 of
 other
 different


macro
 updates
 in
 regards
 to
 inflation,


the
 labor
 market,
 different
 elements
 of


the
 jobs
 data
 that
 we're
 going to
 be


looking
 at.
 And
 so,
 we're
 going
 to
 get


through
 all
 of
 that
 today
 as
 we
 end
 out


the
 second
 week
 of
 December
 uh
 with
 the


S&P
 500
 basically
 at
 all-time
 highs.
 We


did
 hit
 all-time
 highs
 on
 the
 S&P


yesterday
 after
 hours.
 I
 think
 we
 got
 to


69050.


Um
 68970
 was
 the
 previous
 all-time
 high.


So,
 it
 might
 not
 feel
 like
 it
 because


some
 of
 our
 favorite
 stocks
 aren't
 at


all-time
 highs
 individually.
 But
 the


fact
 that
 the
 S&P
 500
 is
 at
 all-time


highs
 is
 quite
 incredible.
 And
 you
 know,


it
 it
 is
 relatively
 healthy
 if
 you
 don't


have
 Nvidia
 that's
 leading
 the
 S&P
 500


because
 you
 are
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 more


of
 a
 broadening
 in
 the
 rotation
 trade,


which
 is
 very
 important
 as
 well.
 So,


we'll
 be
 we'll
 be
 talking
 about
 that.


Uh,
 you
 may
 have
 noticed
 that
 your
 boy


found
 his
 scarf.
 If
 I
 had
 found
 this


scarf
 on
 Saturday
 last
 week,
 I
 wouldn't


have
 missed
 the
 show
 on
 Monday
 because
 I


wouldn't
 have
 got
 sick.
 So,


I
 found
 it
 yesterday
 when
 I
 went
 back


home
 and
 I
 said,
 "I'm
 wearing
 my


freaking
 scarf."
 And
 your
 boy's
 cozy.


Your
 boy
 is
 cozy.
 I
 I
 have
 not
 been
 this


warm


in
 a
 long
 time.
 No,
 the
 heat
 is
 on,
 but


even
 with
 the
 heat
 on
 in
 the
 apartment,


it
 is
 nice
 to
 just
 feel
 cozy.
 So,
 I


don't know.
 At
 some
 point,
 I'll
 probably


take
 it
 out
 cuz
 it
 becomes
 too
 much.


But,
 um,
 it
 feels
 great.
 It
 feels
 great.


Like,
 I
 genuinely
 like
 I
 have
 forgot


what
 it
 feels
 like
 to
 wear
 a
 scarf
 and


protect
 your
 neck
 in
 the
 winter
 in
 the


cold.
 S&P
 500
 right
 there.
 Basically,


alltime
 high
 68890
 in
 the
 pre-market


down
 about
 0.04%.


But
 uh
 I'm
 very
 happy
 to
 be
 to
 be
 having


my
 scarf
 again.
 So


rent
 is
 high.
 You
 got
 to
 save
 on
 heat.


Yeah,
 exactly.
 As
 well
 looks
 like
 a
 neck


injury.


It
 look
 like
 I'm
 from
 the
 Taliban.
 Okay,


that's
 that's
 that
 that's
 probably


accurate,
 but
 still
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to


be
 warm.
 Okay,
 I'm
 just
 trying
 to
 be


warm.
 My
 mom
 did
 not
 knit
 this
 for
 me,


but
 shout
 out
 to
 Scarlet.
 She
 was
 at
 the


uh
 New
 York
 City
 meetup
 last
 year,
 which


by
 the
 way,
 we're
 doing
 a
 stream


tonight,
 7:30
 p.m.
 Um
 the
 person
 who
 is


now
 going
 to
 be
 in
 charge
 of
 a
 lot
 of
 AK


Media
 operations,
 my
 new
 manager,
 she'll


be
 live
 with
 me
 on
 the
 stream.
 It'll
 be


fun
 and
 we'll
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 details
 on


um
 on
 uh
 the
 meet
 up
 for
 New
 York
 in


February
 and
 just
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


updates
 for
 the
 channel.
 So,
 that'll
 be


live
 at
 7:30
 tonight.
 And
 for
 those
 that


have
 been
 waiting
 for
 updates
 and
 a
 lot


more
 details
 and
 just
 like
 more
 um


logistics
 on
 how
 that's
 happening,


that'll
 be
 talked
 about
 tonight.
 But


Scarlet,
 who
 was
 at
 the
 first
 New
 York


City
 meetup,
 who
 bought
 a
 lot
 of
 pounder


at
 $7,
 uh
 she
 knitted
 this
 for
 me
 and
 uh


it's
 it's
 like
 a
 pounder.
 Does
 this
 have


a
 logo
 on
 it?
 She
 had
 a
 hat
 that
 matches


with
 it
 that
 has
 the
 pounder
 logo.
 I


don't
 know if
 the
 scarf
 has
 a
 logo
 on


it,
 but
 she
 knitted
 this,
 which
 is
 which


is
 awesome.
 So
 there
 you
 go.
 Yes.
 A


scarf
 is
 like
 a
 blankie
 for
 your
 neck.


Exactly.


I
 I
 if
 I
 had
 this
 on
 last
 week,
 I


wouldn't
 have
 missed
 the
 show
 on
 Monday.


So,
 I'm
 keeping
 it
 on
 and
 your
 boy's


going
 to
 Your
 boy's
 going
 to
 be
 nice
 and


warm.
 All right,
 so
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 to
 talk


about.
 Let's
 get
 into
 it.
 I
 think
 we


start
 off
 with
 the
 headline
 this
 morning


from
 Nvidia
 and
 uh
 we'll
 get
 deeper
 into


what
 we've
 got
 going
 on
 and
 then
 we'll


get
 to
 Broadcom
 obviously
 because
 we
 had


a
 lot
 to
 talk
 about
 from
 there.
 But
 this


broke
 uh
 about
 an
 hour
 ago.
 This
 was
 the


headline.
 Nvidia
 jumped
 to
 183.
 We'll


see
 if
 Nvidia
 continues
 to
 hold
 on
 to


these
 levels.
 But
 Nvidia
 is
 evaluating


increasing
 production
 of
 the
 H200
 AI


chips
 due
 to
 strong
 Chinese
 demand.


Chinese
 demand
 for
 H200
 chips
 ahead
 of


Nvidia's
 current
 production
 capacity.


Sources
 are
 telling
 Reuters.
 Uh
 now


Beijing
 still
 has
 to
 approve
 imports
 and


is
 weighing
 conditions
 such
 as
 bundling


H200
 bill
 uh
 buys
 with
 domestic
 chips


aka
 not
 only
 allowing
 Alibaba,
 Tencent


and
 some
 of
 these
 Chinese
 tech
 companies


to
 only
 buy
 Nvidia
 chips
 but
 the
 H200
 is


about
 six
 times
 more
 powerful
 than
 the


H20
 which
 is
 the
 last
 chip
 that
 China's


really
 had
 access
 to
 from
 Nvidia
 and


roughly
 two
 to
 three
 times
 China's
 best


local
 accelerators.
 meaning
 that


although
 they
 don't
 have
 Blackwell
 which


is
 significantly
 better
 than
 the
 H200,


the
 H200
 is
 significantly
 better
 than


whatever
 China
 has.
 And
 so
 all
 of
 that


stuff
 we
 heard
 on
 Monday
 which
 caused


Nvidia
 to
 go
 down
 from
 190
 to
 yesterday


like
 176
 around
 uh
 the
 Chinese
 don't


want
 Nvidia
 chips.
 It's
 like
 they
 may


not
 want
 it
 but
 they
 need
 it
 especially


if
 they
 want
 to
 actually
 be
 consistent


in
 keeping
 up
 in
 any
 level
 of
 the
 AI


race.
 if
 they're
 not
 getting
 Blackwell


like
 at
 some
 point
 they're
 going to
 have


to
 concede
 all right
 we're
 not
 going to


get
 the
 best
 chips
 but
 we
 need
 chips


that
 are
 at least
 somewhat
 reasonable
 to


trade
 on
 in
 the
 modern
 era
 and
 you
 can't


be
 using
 chips
 from
 5
 years
 ago.
 From


that
 perspective,
 uh
 again,
 bullish


Nvidia.
 I
 I
 think
 the
 fact
 that
 this


stock
 is
 still
 not
 trading
 closer
 to
 200


is
 just
 presenting
 people
 more
 and
 more


of
 an
 opportunity.
 180
 176
 and
 whatever


the
 fears
 the
 street
 has,
 Nvidia
 is


going
 to
 have
 to
 keep
 putting
 up


earnings
 to
 show
 that
 those
 fears
 are


not
 rational.
 But
 all
 the
 signs
 are


pointing
 to
 those
 fears
 again
 not
 being


rational.
 Jensen
 Hang
 as
 well
 was
 named


the
 time
 person
 of
 the
 year
 from
 um


sorry
 not
 time
 uh
 from
 the
 financial


times.
 So
 he
 was
 part
 of
 the
 time
 kind


of
 like
 architects
 of
 AI,
 but
 he
 was


also
 named
 the
 Financial
 Time
 person
 of


the
 year.
 And
 so
 we
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 these


business
 magazines
 coming
 out
 giving


away
 their
 uh
 their
 person
 of
 the
 year


awards.
 And
 Jensen
 Huang
 did
 it
 for
 the


Financial
 Times.
 He
 also
 told
 Time


magazine
 yesterday
 uh
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


quote
 that's
 been
 going
 viral.
 There's
 a


belief
 that
 the
 world's
 GDP
 is
 somehow


limited
 at
 100
 trillion.


AI
 is
 going
 to
 cause
 that
 100
 trillion


to
 become
 500
 trillion.


So,
 I
 mean,
 it
 would
 be
 quite
 incredible


if
 that's
 the
 type
 of
 labor
 gains,


productivity
 gains,
 margin
 enhancement


that
 we
 see.
 Uh,
 but
 it's
 hard
 to
 bet


against
 someone
 who
 is
 spearheading
 that


entire
 movement
 at
 scale
 the
 way
 that


Mr.
 Jensen
 Huang
 is
 doing.
 So,
 that's


what
 we
 got
 with
 Nvidia
 and
 that's
 why


we're
 getting
 some
 excitement
 as
 well
 in


the
 pre-markets
 for
 Nvidia
 stock.
 Now,


Broadcom,
 this
 was
 the
 big
 one
 for


yesterday.
 I
 was
 live
 with
 Sam
 and
 Chris


and
 Steve
 as
 we
 were
 discussing
 these


earnings.
 Look,
 the
 earnings
 were
 good.


Broadcom's
 down
 about
 5%
 in
 the


pre-market.
 Uh
 I
 I
 think
 there's


obviously
 a
 couple
 reasons
 why
 it's


down.
 It
 did
 pump
 3%
 and
 then
 once


Hawkan
 started
 answering
 questions
 on


the
 call,
 the
 stock
 ended
 up
 tanking,


which
 is
 what
 we
 see
 happen
 so
 many


times
 in
 the
 markets.
 And
 I
 think
 before


we
 even
 get
 into
 what
 he
 said,


stock
 was
 trading
 up
 80%
 for
 the
 year.


So
 I
 mean,
 they
 kind
 of
 needed
 to
 have
 a


perfect
 quarter.
 They
 had
 a
 good


quarter.
 One
 could
 argue
 it
 might
 have


been
 a
 perfect
 quarter.
 uh
 AI
 revenues


doubled
 100%
 year-over-year
 and
 the


guidance
 also
 is
 better
 than
 what
 street


expected.
 So
 they
 beat
 EPS
 by
 like
 what


was
 it
 17%.
 Like
 everything
 that
 they


needed
 to
 do
 they
 did
 in
 a
 pretty


effective
 way.
 The
 problem
 is
 they
 got


asked
 some
 specific
 questions
 about
 none


other
 than
 open
 AAI
 and
 those
 questions


ended
 up
 leading
 to
 them
 saying
 some


things
 that
 well
 were
 not
 the
 most


productive
 things
 to
 say
 if
 you're


trying
 to
 uh
 convince
 the
 street
 that


you're
 going
 to
 get
 paid
 by
 OpenAI.
 And


as
 a
 result,
 the
 street
 got
 a
 little


upset.
 So
 this
 is
 what
 I
 really
 think


brought
 down
 Broadcom.
 Um,
 as
 far
 as
 the


the
 quote
 from
 Hawkan,
 as
 far
 as
 the


open
 eye
 view
 that
 you
 have,
 we


appreciate
 the
 fact
 that
 it
 is
 a


multi-year
 journey
 that
 will
 run
 through


29
 as
 our
 press
 release
 with
 OpenAI


showed,
 aka
 2029,
 10
 gigawatts,
 more


like
 2027,
 28,28,
 2029,
 10
 gigawatts.
 We


do
 not
 expect
 much
 in
 2026.


So
 that
 headline
 immediately
 got
 the


stock
 down
 and
 then
 they
 guided
 for


their
 nonAI
 revenue
 which
 is
 about
 4.1


billion.
 So
 similar
 to
 um
 uh
 similar
 to


what
 it
 was
 last
 year
 as
 flat


year-over-year.
 So
 because
 you
 have a


year-over-year
 nonI
 part
 of
 their


business
 which
 is
 still
 a
 decent
 chunk


of
 their
 business
 um
 you
 know
 12
 billion


run
 rate
 going
 flat
 and
 showing
 no


growth
 got
 upset
 about
 that.
 So
 you
 had


remarkable
 growth
 in
 AI,
 remarkable


growth
 in
 AS6,
 remarkable
 growth
 in
 all


the
 different
 elements
 of
 how
 they're


investing
 in
 capex,
 data
 centers,
 etc.


Like
 everything
 you
 wanted
 to
 hear
 from


Broadcom
 was
 amazing.
 This
 is
 a
 two


trillion
 dark
 a
 little bit
 below
 two


trillion
 at
 this
 point.
 But
 the
 open
 AAI


deal
 was
 a
 big
 deal.
 That's
 what
 got


them
 a
 lot
 of
 excitement
 back
 in


October.
 And
 now
 they're
 saying,
 "Yeah,


in
 2026,"
 and
 you
 know,
 AMD
 hasn't


really
 announced
 any
 OpenAI
 revenue
 uh


in
 a
 meaningful
 way.
 Nvidia
 basically


said,
 "We
 don't
 even
 have
 a
 definitive


agreement
 with
 them.
 We
 just
 have
 like
 a


framework
 for
 an
 agreement."
 And
 now


Broadcom
 is
 saying,
 "Hey,
 this
 is
 going


to
 take
 some
 time
 for
 it
 to
 meaningfully


accelerate."
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 you're
 not


seeing
 that
 type
 of
 momentum
 on
 a
 stock


that's
 up
 80%
 year-over-year
 because,


you
 know,
 they
 just
 didn't
 have
 the
 best


commentary
 on
 the
 earnings
 call.
 Now,


Goldman
 Sachs
 right
 here
 said
 today,


"Manage
 did
 not
 update
 its
 prior


guidance
 of
 40
 to
 60%
 AI
 revenue
 growth


in
 fiscal
 year
 26
 despite
 indicating


that
 AI
 revenue
 is
 accelerating."
 Uh


during
 the
 conference
 call,
 the
 CEO


mentioned
 that
 the
 company
 has
 a
 backlog


of
 73
 billion
 in
 AI
 product
 order
 that


will
 be
 shipped
 over
 the
 next
 six


quarters,
 which
 disappointed


expectations,
 even
 though
 it
 was


presented
 as
 a
 minimum
 and
 management


did
 not
 provide
 an
 AI
 revenue
 forecast


for
 2026.
 So
 although
 100%
 growth
 in
 Q1


was
 guided
 for
 fiscal
 year
 2025
 for
 AI


revenues,
 which
 is
 incredible,
 they
 did


not
 update
 formal
 fiscal
 year
 2026


guidance,
 which
 is
 still
 at
 40
 to
 60%.


Still
 incredible,
 still
 phenomenal.
 40


to
 60%
 growth
 is
 amazing.
 It's
 just
 when


you're
 trading
 at
 80%
 when
 you're


trading
 up
 for
 the
 year
 80%
 and
 you
 are


you
 know
 relatively
 more
 expensive
 than


Nvidia
 when
 you
 compare
 their
 multiples.


Um
 yeah
 you
 you
 cannot
 increase
 guy


which
 is
 the
 funny
 thing
 about
 Nvidia.


It's
 like
 Nvidia's
 already
 relatively


cheap
 25
 times
 2027
 earnings
 and
 they


increasing
 guidance
 dramatically
 and


they're
 they're
 not
 afraid
 to
 give


guidance
 and
 quite
 frankly
 if
 they


didn't
 give
 guidance
 you
 know
 Jensen


giving
 me
 that
 $500
 billion
 number
 and


video
 probably
 be
 trading
 lower
 because


of
 how
 much
 of
 the
 sentiment
 is


negative.
 So
 they
 know
 they
 have
 to
 be


as
 transparent
 as
 possible
 and
 update


guidance
 aggressively
 and
 they're
 not


getting
 rewarded
 for
 it.
 Broadcom,
 which


doesn't
 do
 that
 to
 some
 extent,
 is


getting
 a
 much
 higher
 premium
 than


Nvidia,
 although
 it
 is
 down
 5%
 right


here
 because
 of
 the
 lack
 of
 increase
 on


the
 guidance.
 So
 look,
 if
 you're
 a


Broadcom
 shareholder,
 I
 don't
 think
 you


should
 be
 upset
 about
 this
 call.
 Uh
 I


don't
 think
 you
 should
 care
 too
 deeply


about
 uh
 how
 some
 of
 the
 idiosyncratic


questions
 were
 answered
 by
 management.


Like
 these
 questions
 have
 real


implications,
 but
 at
 the
 end
 of the
 day,


if
 you're
 long
 Broadcom,
 you
 believe


that
 they're
 going
 to
 grow.
 You
 believe


that
 the
 custom
 ASIC
 market
 is
 going
 to


be
 massive.
 You
 believe
 Google's
 TPUs


are
 going
 to
 be
 crazy.
 Uh,
 you
 know,


Broad
 Broadcom
 also
 said
 they
 got


another
 11
 billion
 order
 for
 the


Ironwood
 GPUs,
 again,
 Broadcom
 is
 a
 big


partner
 with
 Google
 to
 make
 those
 GPUs.


They
 didn't
 say
 who
 the
 customer
 is,
 but


it's
 very
 likely
 that
 it's
 anthropic.


So,
 everything's
 going
 in
 the
 right


direction.
 It's
 just
 the
 stock
 was
 up


80%
 for
 the
 year.
 It's
 just
 one
 of
 those


names
 that
 like
 it
 was
 going
 to
 be
 hard


to
 make
 a
 big
 move
 unless
 it
 was


perfect.
 And
 there
 were
 some
 parts
 of


the
 call
 that
 were
 not
 perfect.
 So
 384


right
 here.
 Now,
 does
 this
 pull
 an


Oracle?
 Oracle's
 call
 was
 horrendous.


Okay,
 Broadcom's
 call
 was
 not


horrendous.
 There
 were
 just
 a
 couple


questions
 that
 weren't
 answered
 in,
 you


know,
 the
 best
 way.
 So,
 does
 this
 thing


fall
 10%
 today?
 It's
 down
 5%
 right
 here.


I
 mean,
 maybe.
 I
 think
 that
 dip
 gets


bought
 pretty
 easily,
 even
 if
 it
 doesn't


get
 bought
 today.
 So,
 uh,
 I
 probably


wouldn't
 bite
 at
 the
 dip
 today.
 You'd


probably
 give
 some
 time
 to
 let
 it
 settle


out.
 You
 know,
 three-day
 rule.
 Same


thing
 with
 Oracle.
 But
 if
 it
 falls,
 you


know,
 10%
 during
 the
 day,
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 like
 some
 bearish
 thesis
 for
 the


overall
 AI
 trade,
 for
 the
 overall


argument
 around
 the
 ASIC
 market,
 it's


just
 the
 stock's
 taking
 a
 breather.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 a
 reasonable
 thing
 for
 it


to
 do
 given
 it
 was
 up
 that
 much.
 So


that's
 what
 we
 got
 on
 Broadcom
 and
 we're


going
 to
 see
 how
 that
 affects
 the


broader
 market.
 When
 Broadcom
 was


pumping
 yesterday
 after
 hours,
 we
 had


the
 S&P
 500
 that
 made
 a
 massive
 move


68917.
 It
 closed
 68931.
 after
 in
 the


pre-market
 right
 now
 it
 did
 touch
 69124.


So,
 uh,
 the
 fact
 that
 the
 S&P
 is
 up
 in


the
 pre-markets,
 by
 the
 way,
 and


Broadcom's
 down
 5%
 and
 Oracle's
 down


another
 1%
 after
 those
 two,
 you
 know,


were
 the
 sort
 of
 major
 names
 that,
 uh,


were
 defining
 the
 the
 week
 based
 on
 AI


is
 quite
 incredible.
 And
 it
 means
 we
 are


legitimately
 seeing
 a
 rotation.


And
 that
 rotation
 is
 uh,
 good
 because


there's
 other
 parts
 of
 the
 S&P
 that
 are


not
 lagging,
 which
 is
 very,
 very


important.
 What
 is
 a
 3-day
 rule?
 The


three-day
 rule
 is
 sort
 of
 this
 like


conventional
 argument
 that
 after
 a
 stock


takes
 a
 dip
 immediately
 after
 earnings,


you
 give
 it
 three
 days
 to
 see
 how
 the


street
 reacts
 to
 it.
 And
 after
 3
 days,


if
 the
 stock
 is
 still,
 you
 know,


meaningfully
 down,
 then
 maybe
 you
 want


to
 nibble
 at
 the
 dip.
 Uh
 which
 means


you,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 three
 days
 of
 the


of
 the
 initial
 drop,
 if
 it
 reverses,


then
 you
 miss
 the
 dip,
 but
 like
 at


least,
 you
 know,
 you
 don't
 take
 the
 risk


of
 it
 dipping
 even
 further.
 Uh
 and
 if


the
 stock
 is
 kind
 of
 flat,
 then
 you
 know


that
 maybe
 it's
 consolidating.
 Maybe
 5%


is
 the
 worst
 amount
 of
 pain
 that


Broadcom
 is
 going to
 see.
 Same
 thing


with
 Oracle
 down
 from
 220
 to
 198
 fell


all
 the
 way
 to
 187
 now
 kind
 of
 back
 into


that
 low
 200
 range
 just
 below
 200.
 So


maybe
 if
 it
 normalizes
 there,
 then
 after


three
 days,
 it's
 more
 easy
 to
 buy
 the


dip
 given
 the
 street
 is
 okay
 having


these
 prices.


And
 so
 that's
 what
 we're
 going
 to
 have


to
 see
 for
 for
 uh
 for
 Brock.
 Lulu
 Lulu


crushed
 it.
 Uh
 good
 earnings.
 CEO
 is


leaving.
 Street
 likes
 it
 up
 10.75%.
 They


beat
 EPS
 by
 17%.


Again,
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 these
 retailer


companies,
 if
 the
 consumer
 is
 in
 such


horrible
 position,
 are
 being
 able
 to


beat
 by
 these
 levels,
 but
 they
 are.
 And


so
 Lulu
 on
 trend
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 other


companies
 like
 Abberropy
 and
 Urban


Outfitters
 last
 week
 that
 showed
 good


results.
 Um
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 this


with
 Steve
 last
 night.
 I
 don't
 know


what's
 the
 reason
 to
 be
 super
 excited


about
 Lulu
 going
 into
 2026
 unless
 there


is
 something
 you
 know
 about
 their
 go
 to


market
 or
 their
 brand
 positioning
 that


is
 fundamentally
 differentiated.
 But


outside
 of
 that
 there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of


opportunities
 and
 AI
 again
 Nvidia


trading
 at
 these
 levels
 feels
 weird


versus
 going
 long
 overpriced
 jeans
 and


sweatpants.
 So
 it
 is
 what
 it
 is.
 I
 think


it
 was
 a
 good
 quarter
 and
 I
 think
 you


know
 2026
 should
 be
 fine
 but
 it
 was
 not


like
 something
 they
 said
 on
 the
 call


that
 was
 just
 so
 tremendous
 that
 you


have
 to
 really
 take
 a
 second
 look
 at


Lulu.
 Now
 granted
 I
 haven't
 dug
 that


deep
 into
 it
 but
 it
 was
 a
 good
 beat
 and


raise
 CEO
 left
 streets
 excited
 about


that
 but
 didn't
 get
 too
 much
 besides


that.
 And
 then
 Costco
 relatively
 good


quarter
 as
 well
 that's
 down.37%.
 They


beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 bottom
 so
 nothing


too
 crazy
 for
 Costco
 as
 that
 one
 is
 flat


in
 the
 pre-market.


And
 that's
 what
 we
 got.
 And
 that's
 what


we
 got.
 Dude,
 these
 comments
 about
 the


uh


about
 the
 scarf
 are
 amazing.


I
 should
 wear
 more
 crazy
 stuff
 just
 to


see
 these
 comments.
 These
 are
 these
 are


great.
 A
 mids
 fresh
 Christmas
 caroling.


Oh
 my
 gosh.


This
 is
 a
 great
 This
 is
 great,
 dude.
 I'm


warm.
 I
 can't
 take
 him
 serious
 with
 the


scarf.
 I
 am
 warm.
 I
 love
 it.


I
 am
 freaking
 warm
 and
 I
 need
 to
 I
 need


to
 stay
 warm.
 Triple
 V,
 thank
 you
 for


being
 here.
 Thank
 you
 for
 the
 $200
 super


chat.
 Uh
 I
 was
 on
 the
 phone
 with
 Mr.


TripleB
 yesterday
 and
 uh
 yeah,
 he
 uh
 he


has
 definitely
 been
 crushing
 it
 this


year
 and
 we
 were
 just
 kind
 of
 talking


about
 overall
 portfolio
 management
 and


strategies
 going
 into
 2026.
 And
 so,


yeah,
 it's
 been
 a
 pretty
 strong
 year
 for


a
 lot
 of
 people.
 And,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 that
 have
 been
 doing
 well


for
 people,
 they're
 starting
 to
 come


back
 towards
 the
 end
 of the
 year.
 In


November,
 we
 had
 a
 pretty
 ugly
 draw
 down


for
 everybody.
 And,
 you
 know,
 we
 talked


about
 year-to
 dates
 yesterday.
 Uh,
 for


those
 that
 missed
 it,
 my
 year
 to
 date
 is


70%.
 And
 I
 think
 by
 the
 end
 of the
 year,


that
 can
 get
 closer
 to
 90%.
 But
 a
 lot
 of


these
 names
 that
 took
 a
 hit
 still


haven't
 recovered.
 Some
 of
 them
 have


recovered
 decently.
 So,
 Hood
 went,
 you


know,
 from
 150
 to
 100.
 Now,
 it's
 back
 at


125.
 Not
 a
 full
 recovery
 but
 a
 decent


recovery
 and
 I
 think
 towards
 the
 end
 of


the
 year
 it
 can
 stay
 at
 these
 levels.


Nvidia
 I
 think
 should
 be
 closer
 than


200.
 So
 we
 got
 three
 weeks
 left
 to
 see


how
 these
 portfolios
 turn
 out.
 You
 might


have
 some
 more
 fund
 managers
 and
 if
 you


believe
 in
 this
 Tom
 Lee
 thesis
 that
 are


going to
 start
 chasing
 in
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 as
 they
 try
 to
 get
 their


outperformance.
 But
 I
 think
 at
 this


point
 whatever
 stocks
 are
 in
 your


portfolio
 have
 defined
 your
 year.
 I
 mean


like
 simple
 example
 Rocket
 Lab
 my


goodness
 10%
 yesterday.
 Like
 if
 you're


heavy
 in
 Rocket
 Lab
 and
 that
 thing
 fell


from
 75
 to
 38.
 That
 must
 have
 sucked.


And
 I
 know
 a
 couple
 people
 that
 are
 very


heavy
 in
 Rocket
 Lab
 and
 it
 was
 annoying,


right?
 Because
 you you
 might
 have
 been


up
 like
 110%
 year
 to
 date.
 You
 ended
 up


going
 back
 to
 40%
 because
 one
 of
 your


biggest
 names
 took
 a
 massive
 draw
 down.


This
 thing's
 starting
 to
 recover.
 And
 it


has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 with
 the
 company.


It
 has
 everything
 to
 do
 with,
 you
 know,


SpaceX's
 IPO
 and
 the
 idea
 of
 data


centers
 in
 space.
 these
 narratives
 if


you're
 in
 a
 high
 quality
 company
 can


meaningfully
 affect
 that
 company
 uh
 if


it
 is
 positioned
 in
 the
 right
 way.
 And


so
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 lost
 a
 lot
 of


gains
 on
 Rocklab
 on
 paper,
 those
 are


coming
 back.
 And
 I
 think
 even
 if
 it


closes
 around
 the
 $60
 range,
 people
 will


be
 happy.
 So
 Rocklab
 down
 about
 1.5%
 in


the
 pre-market,
 but
 it's
 up
 40%
 for
 the


week,


which
 is
 just
 incredible.
 And
 so,
 you


know,
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 you're
 getting


some
 momentum.
 Why
 does
 it
 have
 nothing


to
 do
 with
 the
 company?
 because
 Rocket


Lab
 didn't
 announce
 anything
 this
 week.


That
 the
 40%
 move
 this
 week
 was
 not


random
 and
 people
 woke
 up
 and
 they're


like,
 "Oh,
 Rocket
 Lab's
 an
 amazing


company."
 It's
 like,
 no,
 there
 was
 a


massive
 piece
 of
 news
 around
 SpaceX


going
 public
 at
 a
 $ 1.5
 trillion


valuation
 potentially.
 And
 then
 you
 got


Elon
 who
 for
 four
 days
 didn't
 say


anything
 until
 last
 night
 and
 said,


"Actually,
 yeah,
 we
 probably
 are


thinking
 of
 it."
 And
 then
 you
 had
 the


street
 like,
 "Okay,
 so
 do
 I
 buy
 SpaceX


at
 1.5
 trillion
 or
 do
 I
 get
 exposure
 to


something
 else?"
 And
 the
 number
 one
 name


that
 popped
 up
 AS
 by
 the
 way
 also
 doing


well
 was
 Rocket
 Lab.
 I
 don't
 think


Rocket
 Lab
 makes
 a
 40%
 move
 in
 a
 week


along
 with
 the
 other
 space
 names
 unless


you
 have
 excitement
 from
 SpaceX.
 Now
 the


point
 is
 Rocket
 Lab
 is
 a
 space
 company


that
 is
 viewed
 as
 high
 quality
 which
 is


why
 it
 is
 getting
 the
 premium
 and
 it


happens
 to
 be
 in
 the
 right
 niche
 but


they
 just
 didn't
 say
 anything
 in


particular
 that
 you
 know
 would
 cause


that.
 Sorry
 it's
 a
 55%
 move
 in
 the
 past


week.
 ESTs
 as
 well
 of
 50%.


So
 yeah,
 I
 the
 catalyst
 were
 just
 in
 the


right
 place.
 But
 this
 is
 what
 it
 means


to
 be
 in
 a
 high
 quality
 company
 that's


also
 high
 beta.
 Like
 you
 don't
 get
 those


massive
 year-to-day
 returns
 unless


you're
 in
 something
 high
 beta
 like
 a


rock
 collab,
 but
 you
 have
 to
 live
 with


the
 draw
 downs
 of
 70
 to
 30.
 And
 it
 sucks


living
 with
 those
 draw
 downs.
 But
 if
 the


company
 isn't
 a
 meme
 stock
 and
 it's
 very


high
 quality
 and
 it's,
 you
 know,
 growing


and
 they're
 positioning
 themselves,
 even


if
 they
 trade
 an
 aggressive
 multiple,


any
 piece
 of
 news
 inside
 that
 niche
 can


fundamentally
 alter
 the
 trajectory
 of


how
 people
 think
 of
 it.
 And
 at
 the
 end


of the
 day,
 SpaceX
 1.5
 trillion,
 Rocket


Lab
 30
 billion.
 I
 got
 a
 lot of
 people


that
 are gonna
 say
 screw
 the
 valuation.


Like
 if
 Rocket
 Lab
 can
 even
 get
 to


one10enth,
 which
 would
 be
 around
 what


150
 billion
 of
 SpaceX's
 potential
 IPO,


that's
 a
 5x
 from
 here.
 That's
 150


billion
 market
 cap.
 It's
 trading
 at
 30.


And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 uh
 that's
 why


you're
 seeing
 some
 of
 that
 momentum
 for


for
 Rock.
 All
 right.
 So
 we
 talked
 about


Broadcom,
 we
 talked
 about
 uh
 Nvidia,


Tillray.
 So
 the
 weed
 stocks
 are
 going


crazy
 right
 here.
 Uh,
 Tillray
 is
 up
 39%.


Aurora
 Cannabis
 is
 mooning
 in
 the


pre-market.
 Uh,
 ACB
 is
 that
 ticker


that's
 up
 21%.
 So,
 Trump
 basically
 said


yesterday,
 or
 at least
 the
 White
 House,


the
 rumors
 around
 the
 White
 House
 is


that
 they
 are
 going
 to
 declassify


marijuana
 in
 a
 more
 significant
 way.
 Um,


and
 the
 White
 House
 did
 not
 confirm
 it,


but
 you
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 close
 to
 the


administration
 think
 that's
 going
 to


happen.
 Trump
 seeks
 to
 cut
 restrictions


on
 marijuana
 through
 planned
 order.
 The


president
 is
 scheduled
 to
 expect
 direct


to
 expect
 to
 direct
 agencies
 to


reclassify
 marijuana
 as
 a
 schedule
 three


drug
 similar
 to
 some
 common
 prescription


painkillers.


Also,
 yes,
 Golden
 Dome
 for
 Rocket
 Lab
 is


going to
 be
 a
 big
 deal.
 I
 mean,
 if
 weed


ends
 up
 becoming


like
 a
 prescription
 painkiller
 where
 it


is,
 you
 know,
 you
 don't
 need
 just
 like
 a


recreational
 license
 in
 places
 where


it's
 banned,
 but
 like
 you
 can
 have
 a


doctor
 prescribe
 it
 for
 a
 variety
 of


reasons.


I
 mean,
 yeah,
 the
 weed
 stocks
 are
 going


to
 rip
 on
 that
 narrative.
 Yeah,
 the


MSOS,
 that's
 the
 weed
 ETF
 that's
 up
 35%.


Now,
 look,
 would
 you
 take
 this
 trade


expecting
 a
 bigger
 move?
 I
 think
 the


move
 has
 already
 happened,
 but
 then


again,
 this
 is
 a
 pretty
 aggressive


rumor.
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 an
 industry
 that


has
 been
 dead
 basically
 for
 the
 past


five
 years,
 and
 Trump
 is
 sparking
 it
 to


life
 with
 these
 potential
 rumors
 uh
 of


of
 of
 weed
 becoming
 much
 more


accessible.
 So,
 I
 think
 the
 move
 has


happened.
 Obviously,
 the
 move
 can
 keep


going,
 but
 I
 think
 the
 riskreward
 is
 a


little
 bit
 more
 tilted
 to
 the
 risk


versus
 reward
 because
 what
 if
 the
 White


House
 comes
 out
 and
 says,
 "Yeah,
 this
 is


not
 true."
 or
 you
 just
 have
 a
 bunch
 of


people
 that
 take
 profits
 because
 I
 mean


they're
 up
 35%
 40%
 on
 a
 bunch
 of
 these


individual
 names
 and
 and
 it
 kind
 of


doesn't
 have
 the
 uh
 ability
 to
 keep


making
 moves.
 So


yeah,
 weed
 stocks
 are
 continuing
 to
 move


higher.
 Maybe
 that
 actually
 makes
 a
 move


towards
 the
 end
 of the
 year.
 Maybe


that's
 a
 2026
 play
 if
 Trump
 actually


like
 officially
 makes
 this
 a
 real
 thing


and
 uh
 you
 know
 it
 opens
 up
 a
 lot
 of


opportunities.
 But
 we're
 going
 to
 see


throughout
 the
 end
 of
 the
 month
 if
 that


continues
 to
 uh
 continues
 to
 play
 out.


Uh,
 gold
 and
 silver,
 how
 are
 they
 doing?


Silver
 continues
 to
 make
 its
 move
 6447.


Gold
 actually
 up
 2%
 pre-markets,
 4344.
 I


think
 alltime
 highs
 on
 gold
 are
 4,500.


So
 once
 again,
 gold
 and
 silver
 from
 a


commodities
 perspective
 has
 been
 doing


incredibly
 well
 and
 it
 looks
 like
 this


trade
 is
 going
 to
 end
 out
 nicely
 going


into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year.
 How
 many


states
 is
 weed
 legal?
 How
 many
 states
 is


weed
 legal
 in?
 It's
 like
 20,
 right?
 24


states.
 New
 Jersey
 is
 one
 of
 them.
 New


York
 is
 one
 of
 them.
 Uh
 California


obviously
 is
 one
 of
 them.


Massachusetts,
 which
 I
 haven't
 had
 to


say
 that
 name
 or
 that
 state
 for
 so
 long.


And
 now
 that
 I'm
 saying
 it,
 I
 remind


myself
 that
 I
 can't
 say
 that
 freaking


word.
 That
 also
 was
 one
 of
 the
 first


states
 outside
 of
 California
 that


legalized
 it,
 I
 think
 four
 or
 five
 years


ago.


So
 yeah,
 I
 mean
 if
 that
 expands
 anywhere


meaningfully
 to,
 you
 know,
 50
 states,


that
 could
 be
 a
 very,


very
 big
 deal.


Massachusetts,
 dude,
 it's
 the
 freaking


craziest
 name
 for
 a
 state
 and
 I
 can't


say
 it.
 It's
 been
 three
 years.
 For
 those


that
 have
 been
 watching
 for
 three
 years,


I
 can't
 say
 that
 freaking
 word.


Massachusetts.


I
 don't
 get
 it.
 I
 don't
 know
 why
 it


sounds
 like
 that,
 but
 I
 can't
 say
 it.
 Um


S&P
 68917


in
 the
 pre-markets.
 Okay.
 What
 did
 Trump


sign
 yesterday?
 Basically,
 he
 signed
 an


executive
 order
 that
 would
 set
 a
 federal


standard
 for
 AI
 ensuring
 a
 national


policy
 framework
 for
 artificial


intelligence.
 This
 order
 declares
 that


the
 United
 States
 must
 have
 one


minimally
 burdensome
 national
 standard


for
 AI,
 not
 50
 disordinant
 state
 ones.


The
 administration
 will
 work
 with


Congress
 to
 define
 that
 standard.
 The


objective
 is
 to
 prevent
 a
 confusing


regulatory
 framework
 while
 protecting


important
 values
 like
 child
 safety.
 This


order
 is
 not
 that
 framework
 itself
 or
 an


amnesty
 or
 moratorium,
 but
 rather
 a


statement
 of
 principles
 and
 a
 set
 of


tools
 for
 the
 administration
 to
 push


back
 on
 the
 most
 ownorous
 and
 excessive


state
 AI
 laws.
 I
 like
 it.
 I
 think
 it


makes
 a
 lot
 of
 sense.
 If
 we're
 going
 to


have
 massive
 AI
 progress,
 we're
 going
 to


need
 a
 federal
 standard.
 And
 that


federal
 standard
 is
 going
 to
 uniquely


have
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 states
 cannot


stop
 companies
 from
 innovating
 simply


because
 the
 Texas
 standard
 for
 AI
 is
 not


consistent
 with
 the
 California
 standard


for
 AI.
 And
 so
 although
 there's
 going
 to


be
 different
 minutia
 within
 the
 laws


like
 there
 are
 for
 a
 variety
 of
 states


that
 have
 different
 ways
 to
 operate,
 uh


having
 one
 federal
 standard
 definitely


should
 push
 the
 industry
 forward.
 And


again
 like
 this
 this
 this
 broader
 macro


AI
 theme,
 you
 either
 believe
 it's
 fake


or
 you
 believe
 it's
 real.
 If
 you
 believe


it's
 real,
 the
 question
 is
 are
 the


regulators
 on
 your
 side?
 And
 my


goodness,
 are
 the
 regulators
 on
 the
 side


of
 AI?
 I
 mean,
 and
 I
 think
 the
 Trump


administration
 rightfully
 understands


that
 the
 only
 way
 we're
 going
 to
 get


meaningful
 GDP
 growth
 is
 if
 we
 push
 this


industry,
 which
 is
 why
 they're
 even


letting
 Nvidia
 sell
 these
 H200s
 back
 to


China.
 Uh,
 and
 they're
 going
 to
 do


everything
 they
 need
 to
 make
 sure
 this


industry
 succeeds.
 And
 as
 a
 result,
 I


think
 that
 should
 be
 relatively
 bullish


for
 a
 lot
 of
 those
 names.
 Obviously,
 in


the
 semiconductors
 names,
 but
 also
 the


software
 names
 that
 are
 benefiting
 from


the
 AI
 momentum
 pounder
 right
 there.


18656,
 that's
 down
 about
 half
 a
 percent.


And
 then
 you
 got
 Nvidia
 that's
 up
 about


half
 a
 percent
 in
 the
 pre-markets
 as


well.
 Uh
 quick
 update
 on
 Grab.
 So
 I


actually
 have
 an
 update
 today
 on
 Grab.
 I


know
 we
 haven't
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 updates


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks,
 but
 we
 have


a
 big
 update,
 relatively
 big
 update.
 Um


COO
 Alex
 Hungate
 was
 at
 a
 conference
 and


he
 spilled
 the
 beans
 on
 Q4
 and
 demand


reaffirmed
 commitment
 to
 service


accessibility
 and
 holiday
 demand
 peak.


They
 have
 24-hour
 booking
 assistance


booths
 at
 all
 their
 terminals
 and
 their


airports.
 They're
 expecting
 year-to-


date
 data
 showing
 a
 jump
 of
 more
 than


30%
 in
 ride
 hailing
 demand.
 Tourism


demand
 they
 say
 is
 at
 near
 all-time


highs
 and
 certain
 regions
 are
 demanding


higher.
 Grab
 continues
 to
 put
 a
 premium


on
 supporting
 its
 driver
 partners.


Grabb's
 mapping
 algorithms
 generate
 most


the
 most
 the
 efficient
 routes
 to
 collect


all
 their
 locations
 and
 demand
 for


mobility
 and
 delivery
 they're
 expecting


could
 spike
 near
 40%
 or
 higher
 in
 Q4


signaling
 the
 strongest
 quarter
 they've


had
 in
 history.
 quote
 from
 the
 CEO.
 This


quarter
 we've
 had
 to
 actually
 boost
 the


driver
 incentive
 slightly
 because
 the


growth
 in
 demand
 was
 so
 high.
 We
 needed


to
 make
 sure
 that
 we
 could
 maintain
 the


fulfillment
 quality
 and
 reliability
 of


our
 services.


So
 look,
 I
 know
 the
 stock
 is
 not


cooperating.
 Um
 it's
 a
 story
 as
 old
 as


time
 of
 the
 stock
 or
 the
 company


improving
 their
 metrics.
 This
 is
 going


to
 be
 their
 16th
 quarter
 of
 adjusted


even
 of
 profitability
 and
 this
 is
 going


to
 be
 the
 best
 quarter
 ever
 based
 on


what
 we're
 seeing
 with
 tourism
 demand,


Q4,
 etc.
 the
 COO
 basically
 outlined
 and


said
 that
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 their
 best


quarter,
 but
 the
 stock's
 not
 reacting
 to


it.
 And
 so
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 just
 other


factors
 that
 are
 controlling
 the
 stock


to
 stay
 down.
 I
 can't
 fully
 explain
 what


those
 factors
 are,
 but
 all
 I
 can
 do
 as


someone
 who's
 analyzing
 it
 is
 say,
 is


something
 broken
 in
 the
 company
 or


something
 broken
 in
 the
 thesis
 of
 the


stock.
 And
 right
 now,
 something
 is


broken
 with
 the
 stock,
 not
 the
 company.


And
 usually
 those
 tend
 to
 be
 some
 of
 the


best
 asymmetric
 opportunities.
 But
 time


is
 going
 to
 tell.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 if


anyone
 is
 worried
 about
 the
 actual


fundamentals
 of
 the
 company,
 that's
 just


not
 the
 case.
 stock
 market
 is
 a


different
 question,
 but
 hopefully
 we
 do


see
 a
 little bit
 more
 momentum
 going


into
 the
 end
 of the
 year
 after
 again
 we


potentially
 get
 that
 go-to
 acquisition


which
 is
 also
 going
 to
 be
 something
 that


could
 fundamentally
 rewrate
 the
 entire


architecture
 of
 how
 you
 think
 of
 the


trajectory
 for
 demand
 and
 consolidation


in
 the
 region
 over
 the
 coming
 years.
 But


that
 is
 the
 update
 we
 have
 on
 grab.


Okay,
 macro.
 Let's
 talk
 about
 uh
 let's


talk
 about
 let's
 talk
 about
 some
 of
 the


this
 macro
 news
 that
 we
 come
 out.
 Got
 a


lot
 of
 different
 charts
 here.
 Uh,
 one


thing
 I
 saw
 yesterday
 and
 shout
 out
 to


Cactus
 because
 he
 sent
 this,
 uh,


GoFundMe
 for
 people
 that
 don't
 know


that,
 which
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 relatively


global
 product
 and
 most
 people
 have


interacted
 with
 it.
 Uh,
 it
 is
 a
 platform


where
 you
 can
 donate
 to
 causes.
 So,
 if


you
 uh
 have
 a
 story
 around
 something


that
 you
 need
 to
 crowdsource
 money
 for,


you
 can
 write,
 you
 can
 make
 a
 GoFundMe.


They
 actually
 used
 to
 be
 a
 profitable


company.
 You
 used
 to
 take
 a
 fee
 off
 the


money
 you
 used
 to
 get
 and
 then
 I
 think


they
 turned
 into
 a
 nonprofit
 a
 couple


years
 ago.
 and
 you
 can
 say,
 "Hey,


something
 bad
 is
 happening."
 And
 if
 your


campaign
 goes
 viral,
 right,
 like


millions
 of
 people
 could
 be
 donating


money
 um
 and
 and
 you
 could
 raise
 money


in
 that
 way.
 Well,
 thi
 this
 I
 thought


was
 quite
 incredible
 yesterday.
 Uh
 they


put
 out
 their
 their
 their
 top
 three


things
 that
 people
 ended
 up
 like
 making


a
 GoFundMe
 for.
 Number
 one
 was
 charity,


which
 is
 expected.
 Number
 two
 were


monthly
 bills.
 And
 number
 three
 was


faith.


So
 the
 number
 two
 thing
 that
 people
 set


up
 a
 GoFundMe
 for
 going
 into
 uh


throughout
 2025
 was
 just,
 hey,
 monthly


bills,
 right?
 Hey,
 I'm
 like,
 I
 need
 to


be
 able
 to
 pay
 rent.
 I
 need
 to
 be
 able


to
 pay
 this.
 I
 need
 to
 be
 able
 to
 pay


that.
 And
 those
 were
 the
 most
 viral


campaigns
 or
 the
 second
 most
 viral


campaigns
 around
 GoFundMe.
 Now,
 one


could
 argue,
 as
 some
 of
 you
 guys
 say
 in


the
 chats,
 some
 of
 those
 could
 be
 scams.


Yes,
 that's
 that's
 fair.
 Some
 of
 those


obviously
 could
 be
 scams.
 Um,
 a
 lot
 of


these
 stories,
 if
 you
 actually
 have
 ever


donated
 to
 GoFundMe,
 you
 know,
 you
 can


verify
 this
 stuff.
 You
 can
 go
 to
 the


person's
 profile,
 you
 can
 see
 what


they're
 saying.
 So,
 like,
 if
 we're
 not


going
 to
 be
 as
 cynical
 to
 imagine


they're
 all
 scams,
 uh,
 it
 goes
 back
 to


this
 argument
 around
 the
 state
 of
 the


consumer,
 which
 is
 that
 on
 a
 platform


that
 is
 built
 for
 very
 specific
 purposes


around
 certain
 events
 happening
 where


you
 can
 crowdsource
 money,
 the
 second


biggest
 thing
 that
 people
 cared
 about
 to


raise
 money
 for
 were
 paying
 monthly


bills.
 And
 so,
 uh,
 I
 think
 from
 that,
 it


needs
 a
 GoFundMe
 for
 heating
 cause.
 Yes,


that's
 why
 I
 have
 a
 scarf.
 But
 I
 think


from
 that
 perspective,
 it
 obviously
 does


show
 that
 this
 K-saped
 economy
 is
 not


slowing
 down.
 It
 continues
 to
 be


something
 that
 is
 very
 real.
 Um,
 and


more
 and
 more
 people,
 you
 know,
 are
 are


participating
 in
 in
 a
 K-shaped
 economy


that
 is
 benefiting
 from
 some
 consumers


subsidizing
 the
 cost
 of
 other
 consumers,


but
 other
 consumers
 being
 incredibly


weak.
 It's
 just
 conflicting
 with
 the


data
 that
 we're
 seeing
 from
 earnings


where
 companies
 like
 Five
 Below
 are


beating
 on
 earnings
 and
 it
 doesn't
 make


a
 lot
 of
 sense
 because
 you
 know
 that


that
 should
 be
 tailoring
 to
 tailored
 to


the
 lower
 income
 consumer
 which


shouldn't
 be
 shopping
 so
 much
 to
 the


point
 where
 a
 company
 that
 doesn't
 even


have
 good
 margins
 like
 a
 five
 below
 is


ending
 up
 to
 beat
 on
 earnings.
 So
 I
 mean


it's
 quite
 it
 it's
 just
 it
 was
 it
 was


fascinating
 to
 see
 that
 yesterday.
 But


those
 are
 the
 campaigns
 that
 are
 going


viral.


And
 if
 those
 campaigns
 are
 going
 viral,


then
 you're
 seeing
 more
 and
 more
 of
 the


consumer
 needing
 that
 uh
 that


excitement.
 People
 have
 so
 much
 extra


cash
 that
 they
 give
 their
 money
 to
 help


them
 with
 their
 bills.
 Well,
 the
 thing


about
 GoFundMe
 is
 like
 even
 if
 you
 can


get
 a
 campaign
 to
 go
 viral
 and
 get
 a


million
 people
 to
 give
 10
 bucks,
 five


bucks,
 you
 know,
 someone
 given
 five
 or


10
 bucks
 because
 they
 feel
 bad
 after


they
 read
 a
 story
 um
 is
 not
 breaking


their
 bank.
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 they're


necessarily
 rich
 or
 anything,
 but
 if
 you


can
 get
 a
 campaign
 to
 go
 viral
 and
 you


have,
 you
 know,
 thousands
 of
 people


giving
 that
 money,
 you
 know,
 that's


that's
 when
 it
 can
 actually
 produce
 just


bigger
 returns.
 So,
 I
 thought
 that
 was


one
 thing
 that
 was
 pretty
 interesting


yesterday
 given
 some
 of
 the
 other
 macro


stuff
 that
 we
 looked
 at
 as
 well.
 The


other
 update
 right
 here
 in
 the
 macro
 is


what
 Trump
 said.
 So,
 uh
 we
 talked
 about


the
 Trump
 gambling


uh
 regulation
 yesterday,
 which
 he's


thinking
 of
 getting
 rid
 of
 taxes
 on


gambling.
 Uh
 the
 other
 thing
 he
 said
 is


that
 they're
 preparing
 to
 introduce


large
 tax
 breaks
 for
 corporations
 which


would
 function
 for
 R&D.
 So
 the
 tax


guidance
 which
 would
 come
 as
 early
 as


next
 week
 which
 will
 allow
 companies
 to


take
 full
 advantage
 of
 research
 and


development
 tax
 breaks
 under
 Trump's
 new


tax
 bill.
 Corporations
 can
 claim


retroactive
 R&D
 deductions
 set
 to
 be


worth
 67


billion


which
 is
 a
 big
 deal.
 I
 mean
 you
 got
 a


lot
 of these
 companies
 that
 are


investing
 heavily
 in
 AI.
 if
 they
 can


more
 effectively
 use
 the
 tax
 code
 to


more
 meaningfully
 invest
 in
 AI
 and


whether
 R&D
 includes
 data
 centers
 or
 R&D


includes
 new
 ideas
 for
 how
 they
 can
 make


their
 chips
 more
 efficient
 around
 the


entire
 semiconductor
 stack.
 I
 mean


that's
 just
 a
 lot
 more
 investment
 in
 the


overall
 economy.
 We
 know
 that
 the
 Trump


administration
 uniquely
 has
 been


focusing
 on
 not
 a
 consumer
 oriented


economy
 but
 an
 investment
 focused


economy.
 We
 quite
 frankly
 haven't


invested
 uh
 for
 the
 past
 40
 years.


Right?
 The
 United
 States
 companies
 have


largely
 been
 asset
 light.
 Now
 they're


asset
 heavy
 with
 all
 this
 capex.
 So
 that


could
 be
 big
 for
 the
 broader
 AI
 sector


now
 it
 would
 be
 not
 the
 best
 for
 tax


revenue
 but
 if
 it
 increases
 productivity


then
 you
 know
 maybe
 we
 may
 make
 up
 for


it
 on
 the
 other
 side.
 And
 so
 that's
 one


of
 the
 tax
 updates
 that
 came
 out


yesterday
 from
 Trump
 um
 from
 Trump
 as


well.
 Uh
 tenure
 spiking
 right
 here
 at


4.2%.
 That
 is
 correct.
 Seeing
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 move
 right
 there.
 It
 was
 going


down
 yesterday.
 Again
 we
 had
 JPAL
 on


Wednesday.
 He
 was
 pretty
 damn
 dovish.
 Uh


you
 had
 Goulsby
 this
 morning
 on
 CNBC
 who


was
 one
 of
 the
 people
 who
 voted
 to
 not


give
 a
 rate
 cut
 and
 he
 wasn't
 that


hawkish
 to
 be
 honest.
 Basically
 he
 said


uh
 I
 just
 want
 to
 see
 more
 data
 that


inflation's
 going
 down
 because
 I
 think


the
 labor
 market
 is
 cooling
 but
 it's
 not


cooling
 as
 aggressively
 and
 I
 would
 vote


for
 multiple
 rate
 cuts
 in
 2026.


Nonetheless,
 you
 had
 you
 know
 nine


people
 that
 disagreed
 with
 him
 and
 felt


the
 labor
 market
 is
 a
 bigger
 issue.


Tenure
 right
 here
 is
 spiking
 a
 bit


4.198.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 get
 any
 crazy


macro
 data
 today.
 We
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 the


jobs
 claims
 yesterday.
 We
 had
 consumer


confidence.
 So,
 we
 shouldn't
 be
 getting


too
 much
 data
 today.


Uh
 that
 would
 potentially
 affect
 stuff.


But
 you
 do
 have
 the
 tenure


making
 up
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move.
 Uh


another
 chart
 on
 data
 centers.
 So,
 take


a
 look
 at
 this.
 JP
 Morgan


is
 the
 largest
 lender
 to
 data
 center


infrastructure
 so
 far
 in
 2025
 with


exposure
 to
 nearly
 6
 billion
 in
 debt.


And
 then
 the
 next
 one
 is
 a
 Japanese


company.
 Then
 you
 have
 a
 French
 bank.
 Uh


and
 then
 you
 get
 down
 to
 the
 American


banks
 like
 Blackstone,
 Bank
 America,


Deutsch
 Bank,
 Cityroup,
 etc.
 But
 you
 do


have
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 banks
 which
 financials


had
 a
 massive
 run
 yesterday
 that
 are


starting
 to
 get
 more
 into
 the
 data


center
 space
 and
 there's
 obviously


seeing
 this
 as
 a
 massive
 opportunity


which
 is
 also
 spiking
 up
 the
 credit


default
 swaps
 for
 some
 of
 these


companies
 that
 are
 really
 uh
 really


engaging
 in
 this
 this
 debt
 financing.


And
 overall,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 going to
 be


a
 trend
 in
 2026


that
 probably
 doesn't
 slow
 down
 as
 well.


Yeah,
 Feds
 Goldby
 said
 he's
 projecting


more
 rate
 cuts
 in
 the
 medium
 for
 2026.


So,
 he's
 actually
 doubbish
 for
 2026.
 He


just
 wasn't
 doubbish
 for
 this
 particular


cut
 that
 we
 had
 on
 uh
 on
 Wednesday.
 Wow,


look
 at
 this
 headline.
 Interactive


Brokers
 allowing
 accounts
 to
 be
 funded


by
 Stablecoin.


Okay,
 so
 you
 have
 that
 headline
 that
 a


brokerage
 is
 allowing
 your
 account
 to
 be


funded
 by
 Stablecoin.
 Then
 you
 had
 a


YouTube
 headline.
 YouTube
 is
 allowing


creators
 to
 get
 paid
 or
 to
 get
 paid
 to


get
 paid
 uh
 in
 stablecoin.
 I
 thought


that
 was
 a
 pretty
 interesting
 thing.


They're
 basically
 trying
 to
 give


creators
 more
 independence
 by
 choosing


how
 they
 get
 paid
 and
 uh
 you
 can


essentially
 get
 paid
 in
 crypto
 and
 the


interaction
 is
 with
 PayPal's
 USD
 stable


coin.
 So
 the
 thesis
 for
 Ethereum
 is
 that


a
 lot
 of
 the
 stable
 coin
 adoption
 will


continue
 at
 scale
 on
 Ethereum.
 not
 all


of
 it
 on
 Ethereum,
 but
 a
 good
 chunk
 of


it.
 Right
 now,
 I
 think
 it's
 about
 62%
 of


the
 total
 volume.
 And
 you
 know,
 if
 that


continues
 to
 happen,
 then
 we
 should
 see


more
 and
 more
 of
 that
 excitement


for
 Ethereum
 as
 well.


I
 don't
 know
 why
 I
 said
 they hated,
 bro.


That
 was
 a
 weird
 word,
 but
 that's
 what


you
 got.
 Uh,
 Fermy,
 another
 data
 center


stock,
 is
 down
 45%.
 I
 think
 they
 lost


one
 of
 their
 tenants
 this
 morning.
 This


is
 a
 company
 that
 went
 IPO.
 Yeah,
 down


40%.
 I
 believe
 they
 lost
 one
 of
 their


tenants
 this
 morning
 is
 was
 what
 was


announced.
 Uh
 this
 was
 an
 IPO
 back
 in


April
 or
 no
 back
 in
 like
 July.


So
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 a
 big
 heavy
 retail


name.
 But
 these
 data
 center
 names
 are


volatile.
 You
 lose
 a
 tenant,
 you
 lose
 a


client,
 you
 lose
 a
 hyperscaler
 that


you're
 working
 on
 a
 deal
 with,
 your


stock
 is
 going to
 get
 hit
 pretty
 bad.


And
 you
 know
 that's
 what
 we've
 seen
 with


Nebas
 and
 Core.
 We've
 know
 those
 guys.


If
 they
 gain
 a
 client,
 their
 stock
 gets


some
 love.
 If
 they
 lose
 one
 or
 there's


any
 bad
 headline,
 the
 data
 center
 names


obviously
 will
 take
 a
 hit.


So,
 you're
 seeing
 Fermy
 right
 there.


That
 is
 down
 about
 40%.


Dude,
 these
 comments
 about
 the
 scarf.


These
 are
 I
 need
 I
 should
 get
 a
 new


scar.
 I
 should
 get
 a
 different
 color


scarf
 every
 day
 and
 wear
 it.
 First
 of


all,
 I
 just
 feel
 so
 toasty.
 I
 feel
 so


warm.
 I've
 never
 felt
 so
 warm
 doing


market
 open.
 So,


I
 think
 scarfs
 are
 the
 uh
 are
 the
 are


the
 next
 big
 fashion
 thing
 for
 me
 going


into
 2026.


That's
 what
 That's
 what
 we
 got
 to
 do.


Uh,
 okay.
 What
 other
 main
 headlines
 do


we
 have
 this
 morning?
 Again,
 nothing
 too


crazy
 today.
 We
 don't
 have
 earnings.
 We


don't
 have
 anything
 wild
 happening
 after


hours.
 Uh,
 ultimately,
 we're
 going to


have
 to
 see
 how
 this
 plays
 out
 going


into
 next
 week.
 We
 got
 two
 weeks
 left
 of


December.
 So,
 this
 is
 really
 what
 we're


going to
 see.
 Do
 we
 get
 that


outperformance?
 And
 we
 got
 the
 S&P
 500


trading
 at
 all-time
 highs,
 which
 is
 nice


to
 see.
 I
 guess
 Robin
 Hood,
 let's
 talk


about
 that
 for
 a
 second.
 Uh,
 you
 got
 a


lot
 of
 people
 yesterday
 on
 Twitter
 that


are
 making
 these
 proclamations
 that
 I


think
 are
 a
 bit
 absurd,
 but
 nonetheless,


they're
 making
 these
 arguments
 and
 I


don't
 know,
 it's
 not
 even
 worth


responding
 to
 some
 of
 this
 stuff.
 So,


you
 got
 people
 saying
 Robin
 Hood's
 going


down


70
 to
 80%
 next
 year
 because
 they
 looked


at
 their
 November
 metrics
 and
 because


there
 were
 four
 less
 trading
 days
 in


November
 after
 October
 was
 a
 unusually


volatile
 month.
 Therefore,
 the
 November


numbers
 were
 down
 month
 over
 month,
 even


though
 they
 were
 gigantically
 up


year-over-year.
 Their
 argument
 is
 Robin


Hood
 is
 dead.
 I
 just
 I
 don't
 know.
 Like,


if
 we
 enter
 into
 a
 bare
 market,
 which
 is


very
 possible,
 maybe
 that
 happens.
 Yes,


Robin
 Hood's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 massive


hit,
 but
 so
 is
 everything
 else,
 which
 is


why
 the
 analysis
 is
 just
 like
 such
 so


intellectually
 mediocre,
 which
 is
 the


the
 the
 politically
 correct
 way
 of


saying
 really
 stupid.


Like,
 oh,
 we
 get
 a
 bare
 market,
 Robin


Hood
 goes
 down.
 Yeah.
 And
 so
 does


everything
 else.
 the
 top.
 You
 think


Rocket
 Lab's
 holding
 65
 in
 a
 bare


market?
 Think
 Nvidia's
 even
 getting,
 you


know,
 hold
 be
 close
 to
 180?
 Think
 the


S&P
 is
 going
 to
 be
 pushing
 almost
 690?


Like,
 no.
 So,
 like
 if
 Robin
 falls
 80
 70%


or
 whatever
 these
 people
 are
 proclaiming


and
 the
 market
 goes
 up,
 then
 oh
 my


goodness,
 there's
 like
 some
 a


fundamental
 break
 in
 the
 thesis.
 But
 if


if
 we
 don't
 have
 a
 bare
 market,
 I
 mean,


I
 think
 the
 analysis
 from
 some
 of
 these


people
 are
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy.
 So
 yeah,
 I


think
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 tweets
 that
 have


been
 going
 viral,
 I'm
 not
 even


responding
 to
 it
 because
 I'm
 like
 this


this
 doesn't
 make
 any
 sense
 to
 respond


to
 it.
 I
 think
 they're
 discounting
 a
 lot


of
 different
 metrics
 that
 are
 starting


next
 year,
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 mechanisms


of
 growth
 that
 Robin
 is
 rolling
 out
 with


prediction
 markets,
 banking,
 etc.
 Uh
 and


I
 think
 it's
 over


uh
 analyzing
 a
 November
 report
 when
 a


lot
 of
 these
 people
 don't
 even
 know
 how


to
 read
 the
 monthly
 metrics.
 They
 just


see
 the
 headline
 that
 oh
 it's
 down
 month


over
 month,
 therefore
 Robin
 must
 be


declining.
 It's
 like
 that's
 not
 how
 this


works.
 Like
 you
 have
 to
 know
 a


brokerage.
 there's
 four
 less
 trading


days.
 You
 add
 those
 four
 trading
 days.


These
 these
 numbers,
 you
 know,
 they
 they


have
 to
 be
 fundamentally
 analyzed


through
 the
 context
 of
 Robin
 Hood's


business.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 kind
 of
 the


argument
 that
 is
 missing
 from
 a
 lot
 of


these
 people.
 Vlad
 did
 a
 podcast


yesterday
 and
 I
 think
 this
 podcast
 also


was
 pretty
 important
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 he


was
 talking
 about
 with
 um


with
 the
 prediction
 market.
 So,
 let
 me


load
 this
 up
 right
 here.
 Again,
 I
 will


have
 a
 subset
 coming
 out
 on
 this
 very


soon
 and
 I'll
 be
 discussing
 a
 bit
 more


about


um
 what's
 going
 on
 with
 the
 with


prediction
 markets
 and
 how
 big
 I
 think


the
 industry
 is.
 But


you
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 companies


that
 are
 getting
 pretty
 bullish
 on
 it.


Also,
 uh
 what's
 the
 other
 company?


Gemini
 was
 up
 45%
 yesterday.
 Another


crypto
 stock
 that
 is
 building
 their
 own


prediction
 market
 and
 the
 street
 is


giving
 them
 a
 premium
 because
 they
 see


how
 large
 the
 market
 is
 and
 how
 a
 lot
 of


these
 companies
 could
 tap
 into
 it


>> to
 the
 product.
 So
 prediction
 markets
 is


a
 new
 one
 for
 us
 because
 we
 were
 kind
 of


out
 in
 front
 and
 then
 it's
 sort
 of
 like


how
 do
 we
 maintain
 our
 lead
 and
 and


market
 positioning
 and
 you
 know
 when
 we


have
 a
 bunch
 of
 people
 coming
 after
 us.


It
 has
 surprised
 me
 that
 you
 know
 you


have
 the
 exchanges
 uh
 like
 like
 Paulie


and
 Khi
 who
 have
 obviously
 been
 been


there
 from
 the
 beginning
 but
 like
 no


other
 broker
 has
 has
 gotten
 into
 it
 yet.


um
 uh
 no
 other
 broker
 of
 significant


consequence
 and
 I
 I
 think
 they're
 coming


like
 they're
 seeing
 what
 we're
 doing
 uh


and
 they
 see
 that
 it's
 resonating
 with


traders
 and
 and
 just
 with
 mass
 market


retail.
 Um
 but
 yeah,
 I
 think
 we're
 also


moving
 and
 and
 and
 we're
 adding
 new


innovations.
 I
 think
 the
 event
 that


we're
 going
 to
 we're
 going
 to
 unveil
 on


the
 16th
 is
 going
 to
 is
 going
 to
 show


some
 new
 things
 to
 people
 that
 that
 they


haven't
 seen
 before.
 Um
 and
 it's
 the


fastest
 growing
 business
 that
 Robin


Hood's
 had.
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 past
 year,


we've
 gone
 from
 one
 single
 contract,


which
 is
 the
 presidential
 election,
 to


over
 1500.


>> Uh
 we've
 gone
 from
 it's
 basically
 the


volume
 has
 doubled
 quarter
 over
 quarter.


Uh
 Q3
 had
 I
 want
 to
 say
 2.2
 million


contracts.
 Uh
 but
 then
 October
 had
 2.5


million.
 So
 more
 than
 Q3
 put
 together.


And
 then
 you
 had
 November,
 we
 announced


some
 November
 numbers.
 uh
 three
 billion


contracts
 traded
 in
 November
 which
 is
 uh


>> yeah
 that's
 a
 30
 million
 revenue
 in
 a


month
 so
 so
 360
 million
 run
 rate
 if
 you


if
 you
 take
 uh
 the
 November
 numbers
 um


which
 is
 a
 big
 ramp
 and


>> I
 think
 um


>> you
 know
 it's
 it's
 it's
 just
 been
 really


resonating
 with
 with
 the
 traders


>> and
 sports
 betting


>> uh
 sports
 a
 big
 part
 of
 it
 but
 uh
 the


big
 part
 of
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 also
 uh


diversifying
 the
 contracts
 so
 it
 used
 to


be
 just
 elections
 and
 elections
 I
 think


um
 to
 me
 is
 probably
 the
 most


interesting.
 Then
 we
 added
 sports
 and


we've
 added
 a
 ton
 of
 leagues
 there.


>> Is
 it
 sports
 betting
 or
 like
 what
 is
 it


exactly?


>> Uh
 I
 I
 liked
 uh
 most
 people
 I
 talked
 to


call
 it
 wagering.


>> Wagering.
 Okay.
 I
 like
 the
 language


there.


>> Uh
 I
 think
 it's
 different
 uh
 in
 all


seriousness
 to
 sports
 betting.
 And
 a
 lot


of
 people
 ask
 about
 you
 know
 how
 is
 it


different
 from
 a
 regulatory
 standpoint


from
 a
 product
 standpoint?
 I
 think
 it's


significantly
 different.
 And
 I
 haven't


really
 done
 much
 sports
 betting,
 but
 and


what
 people
 love
 about
 it
 is
 you
 can


actually
 trade
 uh
 these
 contracts
 during


the
 game.


>> So,
 you
 know,
 the


>> So,
 I'll
 link
 the
 podcast
 if
 anyone


wants
 to
 listen
 to
 it,
 but
 he
 goes
 on
 to


further
 say
 that
 it's
 more
 like
 trading


a
 stock
 versus
 sports
 betting
 and
 and


the
 more
 research
 I've
 done
 sports


betting,
 by
 the
 way,
 I've
 never
 signed


up
 to
 FanDuel,
 Draft
 Camp.
 I've
 never


been
 a
 sports
 better.
 Like,
 I've
 never


been
 in
 that
 world.
 I've
 just
 like
 never


understood
 the
 real
 appeal
 of
 it.
 also


have
 never,
 you
 know,
 liked
 gambling
 on


sports.
 Um,
 but
 the
 difference
 is,
 as


I've
 been
 doing
 research,
 is
 that
 it's


rigged.
 Like
 the
 house
 always
 wins
 and


if
 you
 win
 too
 much,
 they
 can
 just
 ban


you
 from
 your
 DraftKings
 account.
 In


these
 prediction
 markets,
 again,
 the


fundamental
 difference
 is
 it's


peer-to-peer.
 There
 is
 no
 house.
 You


don't
 if
 you
 lose
 on
 the
 Lakers,
 Robin


Hood
 doesn't
 win.
 Someone
 else
 who
 took


the
 other
 side
 of
 your
 bet
 wins.
 Robin


just
 gets
 the
 fee
 in
 the
 middle.
 which


means
 if
 you
 win
 on
 the
 Lakers
 and
 you


do
 it
 consistently,
 they're
 not
 going
 to


ban
 you
 because
 they
 have
 no
 incentive


because
 all
 they
 want
 to
 do
 is
 collect


the
 fee
 in
 the
 middle.
 And
 so
 from
 that


perspective,
 I
 just
 I
 think
 the


traditional
 sports
 b
 sports
 betting


industry


I
 don't
 understand
 how
 anyone
 can
 be


bullish
 on
 it
 over
 the
 next
 10
 years


because
 this
 is
 where
 consumers
 are


going
 to
 this
 is
 where
 we're
 seeing


rapid
 adoption.
 This
 is
 where
 you're


seeing
 a
 lot
 more
 uh
 from
 a


psychological
 perspective,
 the
 ability


for
 people
 to
 trade
 in
 and
 out
 of
 these


contracts.
 And
 it's
 just
 more
 exciting


to
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 And
 even
 if
 you


consider
 it
 gambling,
 it's
 a
 way
 better


form
 of
 gambling
 than
 the
 house
 being
 uh


having
 a
 built-in
 vig
 to
 to
 to


consistently
 make
 sure
 they
 get
 their


profit.
 So
 the
 point
 is,
 I
 think
 there


is
 a
 world,
 and
 I'm
 in
 my
 research,
 this


is
 what
 I've
 been
 seeing.
 I
 think


there's
 a
 world
 where
 there
 will
 be
 prop


trading
 shops,
 prop
 uh
 hedge
 funds
 that


pull
 tons
 and
 tons
 of
 money
 and
 they


trade
 these
 prediction
 markets
 just
 like


they're
 trading
 stocks.
 I
 really
 do


think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 what
 we
 see
 in


the
 future.
 And
 I
 think
 Vlad
 knows
 that


that's
 happening.
 I
 don't
 know
 what


they're
 announcing
 on
 the
 16th
 for
 their


prediction
 markets
 event,
 but
 I
 do
 think


I
 hope
 it's
 a
 desktop
 version
 of
 the
 app


because
 that
 would
 like
 really
 make
 them


more
 competitive
 with
 the
 other
 guys.
 Uh


but
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 more
 institutions
 are


getting
 into
 this
 game
 because
 if
 there


is
 something
 that
 can
 be
 traded
 whether


it's
 gold,
 silver,
 soybeans,
 corn


futures,
 Nvidia,
 Bitcoin,
 Ethereum,


Fartcoin,
 like
 if
 it's
 something
 that


can
 be
 traded,
 money
 is
 going
 to
 find


it.
 And
 if
 it's
 regulated,
 which
 these


contracts
 are
 already
 regulated
 from
 the


CFTC,
 then
 the
 regulatory
 framework
 just


means
 that
 more
 money
 can
 enter
 into
 it


because
 most
 institutions
 are
 regulated.


So
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 massive
 industry.
 I


think
 it's
 going to
 grow
 next
 year.
 Even


if
 crypto
 takes
 a
 hit
 for
 Robin
 Hooded,


that
 could
 be
 one
 of
 the
 verticals
 that


they
 continue
 to
 make
 more
 momentum
 on.


So,
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 that
 plays


out
 going
 into
 going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the


year.


All
 right,
 folks.
 We
 got
 30
 seconds.


Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.
 We


got
 through
 another
 week
 of
 December.


Again,
 I
 will
 be
 live
 tonight
 at
 7:30.


Uh
 we'll
 be
 doing
 another
 stream
 with


some
 more
 details
 on
 the
 future
 of
 the


channel
 for
 2026,
 the
 future
 of
 the


meetups
 next
 year.
 So,
 we'll
 have
 a
 lot


of
 updates
 on
 that.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 been
 a


good
 week
 so
 far.
 Some
 of
 these
 names


have
 not
 got
 back
 to
 their
 all-time


highs,
 but
 the
 S&P
 hard
 to
 complain


trading
 at
 these
 levels.
 We're
 going
 to


see
 when
 the
 market
 opens
 if
 the


Broadcom
 earnings
 really
 do
 affect
 it.


Again,
 for
 those
 that
 are
 just
 joining,


Nvidia
 headlines
 came
 out
 this
 morning.


Looks
 like
 China
 does
 want
 a
 lot
 more


H200
 chips.
 That's
 why
 Nvidia's
 green.


And
 now,
 we're
 going to
 get
 to
 see
 if


the
 market
 cares
 as
 we
 get
 into
 the


market
 open.
 Friday,
 December
 12th,
 9:30


a.m.
 Thank
 you
 everybody
 for
 being
 here.


I
 don't
 have
 my
 bell
 because
 I'm
 an


amateur
 at
 this
 even
 after
 three
 years.


It's
 in
 my
 book
 bag
 because
 I
 came
 from


my
 parents
 house
 last
 night.
 So,
 give
 me


give
 me
 10
 seconds.
 One.


Okay.
 The
 stock
 market
 is
 now
 open.


I
 think
 you
 do
 this
 after
 three
 years


that
 you'll
 be
 more
 prepared.
 All right,


68793
 on
 the
 S&P
 500
 that
 is
 down
 about


17%.
 Robin
 Hood
 up
 from
 122
 yesterday


that's
 at
 125
 1.3%.
 Nvidia
 that's
 up42%.


Grab
 is
 up
 58%.
 Palenter
 18533


that
 is
 down
 about
 1.1.
 Aurora
 cannabis


and
 these
 weed
 stocks.
 Again,
 Trump
 is


thinking
 of
 making
 marijuana
 a
 schedule


three
 drug
 on
 uh
 on
 par
 with


prescription
 three
 level
 drugs
 or
 sorry


prescription
 medicines
 which
 are


schedule
 three
 drugs
 which
 is
 why
 these


stocks
 are
 ripping
 higher.
 That
 means


you'll
 be
 able
 to
 get
 prescribed
 weed
 if


you
 have
 any
 issues
 which
 is
 quite


incredible.
 So
 that
 is
 why
 those
 stocks


are
 getting
 a
 move.
 Costco
 down
 1%
 Lulu


12%.
 CEO
 stepping
 down.
 Street
 likes
 it


that's
 up
 12%
 on
 the
 day.
 Oracle
 still


down.
 Broadcom.
 Wow.
 Broadcom


7%
 down


on
 Broadcom.
 That's
 a
 little
 aggressive.


$31
 on
 Broadcom.
 37590.
 1.78
 trillion.


Just
 lost


what?
 35
 billion
 of
 market
 cap.
 33


billion.


7.72
 375.20.


Let's
 see
 if
 that
 dip
 gets
 bought
 up.
 Is


that
 affecting
 the
 S&P?
 I
 mean,
 barely.


It's
 barely
 affecting
 the
 S&P.
 Nothing.


68848.
 S&P
 is
 down
 80
 cents
 while


Broadcom's
 down
 a
 lot.
 And
 Broadcom,
 I


think,
 is
 in
 the
 if,
 correct
 me
 if
 I'm


wrong,
 I
 think
 it's
 in
 the
 top
 15


holdings
 of
 the
 S&P.
 So,
 it's
 definitely


a
 player
 here.
 And
 uh
 that's
 why
 Amcor


is
 getting
 hit
 right
 there.
 Amcore
 is
 a


big
 supplier
 with
 Broadcom.
 Um
 Google


might
 be
 getting
 hit
 because
 of
 this
 as


well.
 Google's
 actually
 green.
 Okay,
 so


Google
 holding
 on
 even
 though
 Broadcom


is
 down.
 We
 talked
 about
 Brocom
 in
 the


morning.
 Again,
 I
 don't
 think


fundamentally
 they
 deserve
 to
 take
 a


massive
 hit.
 The
 problem
 is
 they
 said


two
 things.
 Their
 nonAI
 revenue
 is
 going


to
 be
 flat
 year-over-year.
 And
 then
 they


said
 OpenAI
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be


generating
 any
 revenue
 for
 them
 in
 2026.


So
 they
 admitted
 that
 they
 have
 a
 big


OpenAI
 partnership,
 but
 they
 might
 not


get
 any
 revenue
 for
 OpenAI
 next
 year.
 Um


maybe
 they'll
 surprise
 to
 the
 upside.


Maybe
 they're
 just
 being
 conservative.


But
 those
 two
 things
 alone
 along
 with


the
 fact
 that
 the
 stock
 was
 up
 80%
 going


into
 the
 print,
 that
 is
 why
 I
 think
 it's


getting
 hit
 right
 here.
 Down
 8%
 on
 the


day.
 We'll
 see
 if
 that
 gets
 uglier,
 but


Broadcom
 right
 now,
 not
 a
 horrible


quarter,
 just
 not
 a
 perfect
 quarter.
 And


given
 their
 multiple,
 they
 needed
 a
 a


pretty
 perfect
 quarter
 to
 keep
 that


going.
 Netflix
 getting
 a
 move
 that's
 up


2.2.
 One
 of
 the
 reasons
 Netflix
 may
 be


getting
 a
 move,
 and
 this
 is
 very


unofficial,
 but
 nonetheless,
 maybe
 the


market
 is
 potentially
 pricing
 this
 in.


Um,
 prediction
 markets
 have
 Netflix
 at


only
 a
 36%
 chance.
 Paramount
 is
 now
 has


a
 50%
 chance
 of
 closing
 the
 Warner
 Bros.


acquisition,
 which
 technically
 is


bullish
 for
 Netflix
 because
 if
 they


don't
 have
 to
 spend
 $90
 billion
 on
 a


company,
 you
 know,
 that
 might
 be
 better


for
 the
 stock.
 Granted,
 the
 future
 of


Netflix
 might
 be
 better
 if
 they
 spend


that
 90
 billion
 today.
 But,
 uh,
 you


might
 have
 the
 street
 thinking
 that


they're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 Netflix
 or
 not


going
 to
 get
 Warner
 Brothers
 and
 that's


why
 the
 stock
 is
 up.
 Now,
 maybe
 it's
 the


opposite.
 Maybe
 the
 street
 is
 getting


more
 excited
 because
 they
 think


Paramount's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


complete
 the
 deal.
 But,
 you
 have
 two


different
 ways
 to
 interpret
 how
 Netflix


is
 moving
 right
 here.
 Nvidia
 getting


some
 momentum.
 18226.
 Robined
 125.
 It


bottomed
 yesterday
 at
 122.
 We'll
 see
 if


it
 can
 hold
 that
 level.
 Tillray,
 that's


up
 35%.
 Rocket
 Lab
 just
 a
 freaking


rocket
 ship.
 Barely
 down
 on
 the
 day.


6328
 up
 from
 that
 61
 level
 in
 the


pre-markets.
 Broadcom
 continues
 to
 get


hit
 down
 eight.
 Continues
 to
 get
 hit
 as


that
 one
 is
 not
 able
 to
 hold
 its


momentum


from
 yesterday.
 Soundhound,
 what
 do
 we


got
 on
 Soundhound?
 That's
 up
 4%.
 Nebus


is
 up
 a
 little
 bit.
 Again,
 the
 news
 on


Nvidia
 is
 that
 China
 is
 reportedly


seeking
 more
 production
 of
 the
 H200
 from


Nvidia
 because
 of
 increased
 demand,


which
 is
 obviously
 very
 very
 bullish


because
 none
 of
 the
 China
 revenue
 is


baked
 into
 Nvidia's
 guidance.
 So,
 if


they
 get
 any
 bit
 of
 revenue,
 even
 if


it's
 a
 couple
 billion,
 that
 would
 be
 a


massive
 beef
 for
 them.
 Oracle
 right


there
 going
 down
 1.3
 as
 well.
 Looks
 like


Broadcom's
 taken
 Oracle
 with
 it.
 Uh


Costco
 is
 also
 down
 1%.
 Rivian
 unveiled


their
 own
 chip.
 They're
 moving
 off
 of


Nvidia's
 platform
 and
 they're
 building


their
 own
 chip
 in
 house
 which
 they
 say


is
 I
 think
 like
 four
 times
 faster
 at


what
 they're
 trying
 to
 do
 inside
 their


vehicles.
 Um,
 so
 I
 guess
 Street
 likes


it.
 That's
 up
 5.72%
 and
 they
 have
 their


AI
 day
 yesterday.
 That
 was
 getting


investors
 more
 excited.
 So
 green
 2722.


How
 about
 Tesla?
 Tesla's
 452.
 That's
 up


1.3.
 Tesla's
 been
 chilling
 around
 this


430
 450
 level
 for
 the
 past
 realistically


two
 weeks
 now
 and
 it
 feels
 like
 it
 wants


to
 break
 out
 closer
 to
 that
 465
 that
 it


was
 at
 a
 month
 ago.
 But
 right
 now


holding
 450
 is
 not
 horrible.
 I
 renat
 now


Iren
 is,
 you
 know,
 I
 I
 know
 people
 who


bought
 Iran
 at
 6070
 probably
 don't
 love


the
 price
 action,
 but
 if
 you
 bought


Iran,
 you
 know,
 in
 the
 20s
 or
 30s,
 you


got
 to
 be
 happy
 with
 the
 consolidation.


Like
 I
 feel
 like
 it's
 it's
 like
 I
 think


at
 70
 and
 80
 most
 people
 understood,


hey,
 this
 thing
 is
 up
 8x
 for
 the
 year.


You
 know,
 maybe
 it's
 a
 little


aggressive.
 Now
 it's
 up
 4x
 for
 the
 year,


which
 is
 still
 aggressive,
 but
 uh
 it's


consolidating.
 Same
 thing
 with
 Nebas.
 I


mean,
 Nebia's
 been
 chilling
 in
 the
 90s,


85
 to
 90s
 for
 the
 past
 three
 weeks
 now.


I
 don't
 think
 that's
 horrible.
 Doesn't


have
 to
 jump
 to
 140
 immediately.
 I
 think


it's
 developing
 a
 new
 base
 of
 investors


and
 actually
 gaining
 some
 momentum
 here


inside
 of
 these
 levels,
 which
 will
 allow


it
 to
 make
 the
 next
 leg
 up.
 Same
 thing


with
 Iran
 and
 then
 you
 know
 potentially


same
 thing
 for
 core
 that
 is
 down
 50%


from
 those
 highs
 at
 at
 150
 87
 on
 core


basically
 flat
 on
 the
 day.
 Apply
 digital


this
 one
 as
 well
 that's
 up
 1%.
 This
 was


thing
 was
 pushing
 35
 earlier
 this
 week.


This
 one's
 still
 up
 a
 lot
 year
 today.


Lulu's
 still
 up
 10%
 on
 the
 day.
 Sound


did
 get
 a
 $15
 price
 target
 this
 morning


and
 that's
 why
 they're
 getting
 some


momentum.
 Andos,
 how
 about
 this
 one
 from


a
 drone
 perspective?


Flat,
 but
 that
 one
 also
 up
 250%.


Year
 to
 date,
 hoodie
 124.
 S&P
 barely


budging
 68855.
 I
 mean,
 we're
 there.


We're
 basically
 at
 all
 time
 highs.
 We're


very
 close
 to
 7,000.
 Tom
 Lee
 says
 7,700


next
 year.
 Um,
 which
 is
 11%
 upside.
 He's


not
 being
 uber
 bullish,
 but
 he
 is


expecting
 a
 decent
 level
 of
 upside.
 You


have
 some
 other
 firms
 like
 Oppenheimer


coming
 out
 at
 8,100.


And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 going
 to


depend
 on
 how
 aggressive
 we
 are
 when
 it


comes
 to
 actually
 lowering
 rates.
 AMD
 is


up
 222.
 That
 goes
 green.
 The
 China
 news


for
 Nvidia
 should
 be
 good
 for
 AMD


regardless.
 181
 on
 Nvidia.
 Rocket
 Lab,


are
 we
 still
 holding
 on?
 Wow.
 Rocket
 Lab


goes
 green
 again.
 6350


on
 Rocket
 Lab
 as
 it's
 holding
 on.
 Google


right
 there
 at
 313.
 Broadcom,
 are
 we


still
 tanking?


We
 are


all
 right.
 We
 bounced
 from
 372
 424
 to


377
 though.
 The
 shorts
 definitely
 won


today
 on
 Broadcom.


Pretty
 ugly
 reversal,
 but
 also
 kind
 of


expected
 just
 given
 how
 high
 they've


been
 trading
 this
 year.
 Admit
 you
 look


like
 a
 failed
 poet.
 You
 know,
 that's


actually
 a
 good
 one.
 That's
 a
 failed


poet.
 It's
 low-key
 legit.


That
 is
 a
 that
 is
 definitely
 a
 way
 to
 to


describe
 it.


Um,


I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 of
 a
 poem
 right
 now


that
 I
 can
 say,
 but
 I
 think
 I
 I
 think


I'd
 rather
 not.


I'm
 trying
 right
 now
 on
 the
 top.
 I
 got


the
 pressure
 to
 come
 up
 with
 a
 poem
 that


would
 be
 funny.


I'm
 like,
 "All
 right,
 roses
 are
 red,


violets
 are
 blue."


I
 like
 the
 stock
 market.
 How
 about
 you?


Okay,
 that
 was
 bad.
 That
 was
 so
 bad.
 But


it's
 the
 attempt
 that
 counts.


It's
 the
 attempt.
 You
 got
 to
 try
 in


life.
 You
 got
 to
 try.


When
 people
 don't
 try,
 they
 don't
 have
 a


chance.


Make
 it
 about
 Massachusetts.


Oh
 my
 god.
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 the
 hell


rhymes
 with
 Massachusetts.
 Bitcoin
 right


there.
 92.5.


92.5


on
 Bitcoin.
 Where's
 ETH?


Ethy
 35
 to
 3200,
 which
 is
 leaving
 BMR
 at


least
 holding
 30.
 I
 mean,
 the
 fact
 that


BMR
 is
 holding
 close
 to
 40,
 I'll
 take


it.
 Up
 from
 23
 3
 weeks
 ago,
 I
 will
 take


it
 even
 if
 we
 we
 did
 get
 to
 42
 yesterday


as
 well.
 So,
 it's
 not
 horrible
 here.


It's
 not
 horrible
 at
 these
 levels.
 Wow.


Tesla
 458.


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 any
 news
 on
 Tesla


outside
 of
 Elon
 tweeting
 yesterday
 a
 lot


about
 this
 whole
 data
 center
 and
 space


thing.


I
 don't
 think
 there's
 anything
 specific


on
 Tesla.
 I
 think
 we
 got
 some
 price


target
 upgrades
 earlier
 in
 the
 week,
 but


nothing
 right
 now.
 Rivian
 is
 hitting
 a


new
 all-time
 high
 right
 here.
 Uh
 not


alltime
 high,
 but
 new
 high
 for
 the
 day.


Elon
 mentions
 convergence
 between
 Tesla,


SpaceX,
 and
 XAI
 once
 again.


Okay,
 I
 don't know
 if
 this
 is
 the
 reason


why
 it's
 pumping,
 but
 maybe.


Yeah,
 but
 it's
 underneath
 a
 comment


around
 data
 centers
 in
 space.
 Tesla
 AI


chips,
 SpaceX
 satellites,
 XAI's
 Gro,
 you


know,
 I
 mean,
 we
 talk
 about
 data
 centers


in
 space.
 You
 need
 AI,
 you
 got
 XAI,
 you


need
 the
 satellites,
 you
 got
 SpaceX,
 and


then
 you
 need
 the
 chips,
 you
 have
 Tesla


with
 what
 they're
 doing
 with
 with
 the


training.
 So,
 you
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 could
 come
 together
 to
 make


this
 happen.
 I
 do
 want
 to
 remind
 people


though,
 we
 talked
 about
 this
 yesterday.


SpaceX
 revenue
 is
 $15
 billion.


This
 is
 why
 Elon
 is
 pumping
 the
 space


center,
 the
 the
 data
 centers
 and
 space


narrative
 because
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 you


justify
 a
 $ 1.5
 trillion
 valuation
 with


15
 billion
 in
 revenue.
 Could
 you


theoretically
 sell
 that
 to
 the
 public?


Yes.
 But
 it's
 easier
 if
 they
 have
 a


story
 outside
 of
 Starlink
 to
 be
 excited


about
 and
 going
 to
 Mars,
 which
 might
 not


be
 a
 story
 that
 manifests
 itself
 anytime


soon.
 And
 that
 story
 is
 data
 centers
 in


space.
 So,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 if
 Elon
 is


serious
 about
 getting
 uh
 SpaceX
 to
 go


public,
 he's
 going
 to
 be
 really
 bullish


about
 this
 narrative
 and
 that
 will


probably
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 people


interested
 in
 actually


buying
 SpaceX
 stock.
 Rivian
 right
 there,


13%
 on
 the
 day.
 So,
 looks
 like
 the


street
 was
 happy
 with
 their
 news
 around


their
 AI
 products


and
 you're
 getting
 Rivian
 to
 have
 a


decent
 chunk
 of
 momentum
 right
 here


as
 it's
 green.
 I
 don't
 really
 understand


what
 they're
 doing
 with
 this
 new
 chip.
 I


mean,
 we
 listened
 to
 a
 little bit
 of
 it


yesterday.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 dive
 super


deep
 into
 it.
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 that's


going
 to
 help
 them
 sell
 more
 cars


or
 if
 they're
 switching
 from
 using
 the


the
 car
 sales
 and
 the
 the
 lack
 of


profitability
 they
 have
 on
 the
 car


sales,
 which
 has
 been
 five
 years,
 they


cannot
 make
 a
 profit
 to
 something


different.
 But
 did
 Rivian
 become
 a
 tech


company
 yesterday?
 Because
 just
 because


you
 make
 chips
 doesn't
 necessarily
 mean


that,
 you
 know,
 you
 can
 you
 have
 a
 you


have
 the
 the
 streets
 the
 street
 can
 view


you
 as
 having
 the
 potential
 to
 generate


SAS-like
 revenue
 with
 nice
 gross


margins,
 which
 obviously
 the
 whole


thesis
 on
 FSD
 is
 that
 that's
 what
 Tesla


is
 able
 to
 do.
 So,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 why
 it's


getting
 the
 move
 right
 here,
 but
 it
 is


getting
 a
 12%
 hit
 to
 the
 upside.


And
 you
 got
 Rivian
 at
 1843


on
 the
 day.
 Uh,
 Nvidia
 trying
 to
 get
 to


182.
 Oracle
 1940
 for
 Oracle.
 It's
 still


dumping.
 It
 got
 back
 to
 200
 yesterday.


Cannot
 hold
 it.
 I
 feel
 like
 Broadcom's


still
 down.
 Yeah,
 Broadcom
 very
 close
 to


the
 lows
 of
 the
 days.
 374.
 That's
 down


about
 8%.
 DraftKings
 up
 a
 little
 bit.


Planet
 Labs
 continuing
 to
 have
 a
 great


week.
 It's
 up
 like
 40%
 for
 the
 week.


Silver
 continuing
 to
 do
 well.
 Uber
 at


85.89.
 Warner
 Brothers,
 look
 at
 that.


29.90.


That
 is
 very
 close
 to
 the
 acquisition


price.


and
 Netflix
 is
 pumping
 at
 the
 same
 time


up
 3%.
 So
 either
 the
 street
 is
 bullish


Netflix
 buying
 Paramount
 or
 sorry
 Warner


Brothers
 or
 it's
 bullish
 Paramount


getting
 Warner
 Brothers
 so
 Netflix


doesn't
 have
 to
 spend
 the
 money
 and


that's
 why
 Netflix
 is
 pumping.


So
 like
 there's
 two
 ways
 to
 to
 make
 the


argument
 but
 there's
 not
 a
 Oh
 Netflix


did
 have
 some
 some
 they're
 introducing


like
 some
 new
 studio
 in
 in
 Texas


yesterday.


I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's
 enough
 to
 get
 the


stock
 up
 a
 lot.


Um,
 but
 I
 guess
 that
 was
 one
 headline


that
 they
 had
 as
 well.
 Netflix
 is


opening
 a
 100,000
 square
 feet


place
 in
 Dallas
 where
 FL
 fans
 can


explore,
 taste,
 play,
 and
 shop
 favorite


shows
 and
 movies
 in
 real
 life.


Is
 this
 kind
 of
 like
 an
 amusement
 park?


I
 mean,
 it's
 not
 an
 amusement
 park,
 but


it's
 kind
 of
 like
 a
 destination


entertainment
 destination
 center.


Okay.
 Okay,
 I
 don't
 know if
 that's


enough
 to
 give
 this
 a
 3%
 move,
 but
 that


is
 one
 of the
 headlines
 that
 we
 have.


Nike,
 wow,
 Nike
 also
 getting
 some
 love.


1.7


maybe
 the
 streets
 getting
 a
 little
 bit


more
 bullish
 about
 the
 Supreme
 Court


getting
 rid
 of
 tariffs.
 Wow,
 Tessy,


she's
 pushing
 460.
 Let
 me
 check


resistance
 there
 at
 460.
 But,
 um,
 ELF,


Nike,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 that,
 uh,


could
 benefit
 from
 their
 supply
 chains


in
 China
 not
 being
 taxed
 aggressively
 or


tariffed
 aggressively.


And
 Trump
 has
 kind
 of
 all
 but
 admitted


the
 Supreme
 Court's
 going
 to
 overturn


the
 tariffs.
 So
 maybe
 that's
 getting
 the


market
 excited.


Goldman
 Sachs
 S&P
 target
 7600.


Okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 more
 of


these
 targets
 coming
 into
 the
 next


coming
 weeks.
 Goldman
 Sachs
 at
 7600o.


Tom
 Lee
 at
 7700.
 460.
 102,000
 shares,


folks.
 102,000
 shares
 at
 460
 for
 Tesla.


Adobee's
 getting
 a
 move
 357.
 That's
 up


2%.
 They
 had
 a
 great
 earnings.
 Street


didn't
 react
 too
 much,
 but
 they
 had
 a


great
 earnings.
 Wow.
 Broadcom
 new
 lows


371.


Street
 is
 not
 happy
 with
 some
 of


Hawkan's
 answers.
 And
 again,
 this
 price


action
 I
 don't
 think
 is
 bearish
 broadcom


the
 company.
 It's
 just
 that
 quarter,
 as


good
 as
 it
 was,
 left
 some
 concerns


around
 a
 guidance
 for
 fiscal
 year
 2026


AI
 revenues,
 which
 they
 did
 not


increase,
 and
 then
 b
 the
 lack
 of
 opening


eye
 revenue
 that
 they
 explicitly
 said


they're
 not
 going
 to
 see
 in
 2026.
 And


that
 might
 be
 taking
 Google
 down
 with
 a


31140


on
 the
 Googles
 right
 here.


Amazon's
 down
 as
 well.
 Dude,
 Amazon,
 we


should
 we
 should
 rename
 Amazon
 to


uh
 instead
 of
 Amazon.com,
 it
 should
 be


called
 Amazon
 stablecoin
 because
 if
 you


look
 at
 the
 stock
 price,
 look
 at
 this.


This
 is
 a
 stable
 coin.
 This
 is
 like
 this


thing
 doesn't
 move.


I
 mean,
 if
 you're
 selling
 calls
 on
 this


thing,
 if
 you
 have
 a
 ton
 of
 shares
 and


you're
 selling
 aggressive
 calls
 every


week,
 you're
 surviving
 every
 week
 and


taking
 money
 from
 the
 call
 buyers


to
 do
 nothing
 other
 than
 sit
 and
 hold
 a


stock
 that
 is
 one
 of the
 greatest


companies
 on
 the
 planet
 that's
 just
 not


moving.


PayPal
 is
 the
 other
 stable
 coin
 that's


out
 there,
 but
 PayPal
 doesn't
 have
 as


good
 of
 a
 premium
 as
 Amazon.
 It's
 also


not
 as
 safe
 as
 that.
 Like
 the
 fact
 that


you
 can
 hold
 a
 company
 like
 Amazon,


which
 should
 be
 a
 relatively
 safe


investment,
 and
 milk
 it
 for
 premiums


every
 week
 and
 not
 be
 worried
 about
 it


getting
 called
 away
 and
 the
 one
 time
 it


gets
 out
 of
 the
 money,
 you're
 like,
 "Oh,


don't
 worry,
 it'll
 come
 back."
 Like,
 you


can't
 do
 that
 with
 a
 lot
 of the
 Mac
 7s,


but
 with
 Amazon,
 like
 I'm
 not
 running


any
 cover
 I'm
 honestly
 scared
 to
 cover


calls
 on
 Nvidia.
 I'm
 not
 I
 have
 zero


covered
 calls
 on
 my
 entire
 Nvidia


position,
 which
 is
 honestly
 thousands
 of


dollars
 a
 week
 that
 I'm
 missing
 out
 on.


But
 I
 don't
 trust
 it.
 Like
 I
 just
 I


really
 like
 a
 185
 call.
 Nope.
 No
 way.


Even
 190.
 I'm
 like
 this
 thing
 could
 move


instantly.
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 at
 190
 on


Monday.
 Like
 imagine
 you
 had
 cover
 calls


or
 sorry
 on
 Tuesday.
 Imagine
 you
 got


cover
 calls
 on
 Tuesday
 at
 190.
 Like


you'd
 be
 super
 scared
 because
 what
 if


you
 know
 fundamentally
 it
 deserves
 to


trade
 there
 and
 then
 if
 they
 have
 any


external
 catalyst
 that
 gets
 it
 there.


It's
 like
 boom.


Then
 you're
 kind
 of
 screwed
 on
 the


calls.


But
 with
 Amazon
 it's
 not
 as
 big
 of
 a


concern.
 Uh,
 Rivian
 still
 holding
 12%.


BMR
 still
 down.
 Broadcom
 once
 again,


lows
 of
 the
 day
 370.


370.
 Yes,
 Grab
 is
 also
 the
 biggest


stable
 coin,
 but
 Grab
 has
 no
 premiums,


which
 is
 the
 problem.
 It's
 up
 2%
 today.


But
 if
 you're
 holding
 on
 to
 a
 lot
 of


Grab
 shares,
 unfortunately,
 there's
 just


not
 a
 lot
 of
 premium
 to
 to
 milk
 out
 of


it.
 Nike
 right
 there
 up
 2%.
 Adobe
 up


2.5.
 Veronica,
 my
 wow,
 it
 touched
 369.


Dude,
 that's
 a
 freaking
 $50
 reversal


from
 the
 highs
 of
 last
 night.


A
 $50
 reversal,
 losing
 370,


touched
 369
 again.
 There
 you
 go.
 Two


times
 touching
 369.


We'll
 see
 if
 it
 can
 bounce
 right
 there.


Is
 anyone
 buying
 the
 dip?
 Anyone


selling?
 Anyone?


I
 don't
 know.
 Do
 you
 have
 any
 option


strategy
 on
 Broadcom?
 Selling
 puts,


selling
 calls?


I
 When's
 the
 last
 time
 we
 were
 at
 369
 on


Broadcom?
 Last
 time
 we
 were
 here
 was


November
 24th,
 right
 before


Thanksgiving.


Wow.
 So,
 we
 basically
 had
 a
 10%
 move


from
 November
 24th
 to
 December
 12th.


And
 then
 the
 last
 time
 before
 that,


we're
 at
 what?
 369.
 Last
 time
 we
 had


before
 November
 24th
 was


uh
 basically
 end
 of
 October,
 early


November.
 So
 you're
 basically
 getting


back
 to
 one
 month
 prices


or
 one
 month
 ago
 prices,
 which
 is
 not


crazy.


368.


She's
 falling.


She
 can't
 get
 up.


Um,


I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 of
 a
 poem
 right
 now,


dude.
 I'm
 trying
 to
 think
 of
 a
 poem
 to


describe
 Broadcom.
 You
 got
 me
 on
 this


poem
 thing.
 Roses
 are
 red,
 violets
 are


blue.


Broadcom
 is
 down
 10%.


Uh,


someone
 needs
 to
 sneeze
 and
 say
 a
 chew.


So
 Broadcom
 can
 get
 some
 blessings


so
 that
 it
 goes
 up.
 Okay.
 See,
 it
 didn't


like
 it
 makes
 sense,
 Phil.
 Like
 like
 the


the
 the
 poem
 makes
 sense
 because


Broadcom
 needs
 some
 blessings
 and
 a
 two


rhymes
 with
 blue.
 The
 problem
 is
 a
 chew


is
 not
 the
 punchline.
 And
 I
 had
 to


explain
 the
 rest
 of
 it,
 which
 is
 why
 it


became
 very
 cringe
 over
 the
 past
 30


seconds.
 But
 the
 point
 is
 in
 life,
 the


attempt
 is
 what
 matters.
 The
 attempt
 is


what
 matter.
 If
 you
 don't
 try,
 you
 don't


have
 a
 chance.
 So,
 it
 didn't
 work
 that


time.
 It
 did.
 I'll
 be
 be
 honest,
 that


one
 failed,
 but
 you
 got
 the
 intent
 of


what
 I
 was
 trying
 to
 do.
 And
 the
 achieve


rhymed
 with
 blue.
 It's
 just
 I
 didn't


have
 enough
 time
 to
 think
 about
 it


because
 I'm
 doing
 a
 live
 stream
 right


now
 to
 really
 make
 it
 make
 sense.
 And


the
 blessings
 part
 made
 sense
 because


you
 need
 some
 blessings
 because
 the


stock
 is
 down
 tip.
 So,
 like
 the
 the


framework
 for
 this
 to
 work
 was
 there.
 It


just
 didn't
 come
 together.


But
 the
 attempt
 in
 life
 is
 what
 matters.


How
 do
 I
 unsubscribe?
 Okay.
 Anyway,
 uh


Tessy45840.


45840.
 Rocket
 Lab.
 Is
 she
 really
 going


to
 push
 65?


She
 actually
 going
 to
 push
 65
 resistance


on
 65.


38,000
 shares.


38,000
 shares
 on
 Rocket
 Lab.


Dude,
 I
 I
 just
 like
 Dude,
 I
 love
 Rocket


Lab.
 I
 think
 it's
 a
 great
 company.
 I've


been
 long
 since
 25.
 I
 just
 I
 did
 not


expect
 a
 40%
 move
 this
 week.
 I
 really


didn't.
 And
 it
 is
 amazing
 to
 see
 that
 uh


given
 this
 SpaceX
 narrative.
 Now


granted,
 the
 SpaceX
 narrative
 and
 the


IPO
 goes
 away.
 Maybe
 you
 see
 a
 draw
 down


in
 Rock
 Lab
 because
 I
 think
 that's


what's
 propping
 it
 up.
 But
 then
 again,


Elon's
 obsessively
 tweeting
 about
 these


data.
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 I
 think
 I
 don't


think
 that
 narrative
 is
 going
 away.
 I


think
 he's
 pushing
 this
 thing
 because
 he


knows
 to
 get
 this
 thing
 public,
 you
 need


a
 big
 big
 story.
 And
 that
 story
 is
 going


to
 encompass
 Rocket
 Lab,
 ESTS,
 and
 all


those
 guys,
 Redwire,
 etc.


and
 the
 streets
 liking
 it.
 SoFi
 goes
 red


26.97.
 S&P
 goes
 red.
 All right,
 so


you're
 actually
 getting
 a
 move
 on
 the


S&P
 that's
 down
 about
 0.25%.
 Nvidia
 goes


red
 as
 well.
 Is
 this
 because
 of


Broadcom?
 Broadcom
 still
 down
 9%.
 We
 did


hit
 368.
 It's
 trying
 to
 keep
 above
 368.


36
 bucks
 down
 on
 the
 day.
 Amazon
 goes


red
 by
 1%.
 Grab
 somehow
 holding
 up.


Apply
 Digital
 about
 to
 go
 red.
 Cororee


goes
 red.
 Nebus
 goes
 red.
 I
 goes
 red.


Costco
 still
 red.
 Hoodie
 very
 close
 to


going
 red.
 Palunteer
 went
 red
 2%
 down.


Lulu's
 up
 12.
 Lulu's
 I
 guess
 your
 hedge


today
 against
 tech.
 And
 then
 Oracle
 down


2%.
 Is
 there
 a
 headline?
 The
 Q's
 are


down.
 Q's
 are
 down
 1%.
 Okay,
 let's
 see.


Let's
 see
 if
 there's
 something
 we're


missing
 or
 if
 it's
 just
 Broadcom.


Tesla's
 also
 holding
 on
 uh
 at
 force.


It's
 weird.
 Tesla's
 not
 getting
 hit
 with


the
 Wow.
 Tesla
 breaks
 through
 4.
 What
 a


weird
 day.
 Netflix
 is
 up
 2%.
 Warner


Brothers
 is
 almost
 at
 the
 acquisition


price.
 Rivian's
 up
 18.
 Tesla's
 at
 460.


Broadcom
 explainable
 down
 9%.


And
 then
 Amazon
 falls
 with
 it.
 Google


falls
 with
 it.
 The
 Q's
 fall
 with
 it.


Tesla's
 like
 if
 Tesla
 was
 down
 3%,
 the


Q's
 would
 be
 down
 almost
 1.5%
 today.


It's
 holding
 up
 pretty
 nicely.
 It
 is


option
 expiry
 day.
 That
 is
 correct.


Today's
 Friday,
 December
 12th.
 So
 you


have
 now
 it's
 not
 like
 quad
 witching
 or


anything
 where
 you
 have
 like
 trillions


of
 dollars
 expiring.
 So


um
 but
 you
 do
 yes
 you
 do
 have
 options


expiring.


Uh
 wow
 461
 on
 Tessy
 Adobe
 as
 well


looking
 like
 a
 little
 safety
 play
 at


359.
 Salesforce
 also
 somewhat
 green.


Where's
 PayPal?
 PayPal
 green.
 Nvidia


just
 flipped
 green.


A
 little
 weird
 price
 action
 right
 here.


Not
 really
 able
 to
 get
 a
 consistent


narrative.
 Hoodie
 just
 flipped
 green


again.
 You
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 moving


back
 and
 forth,
 but
 I
 think
 Broadcom


being
 down
 is
 kind
 of
 the
 major


narrative.
 No,
 Broadcom's
 little
 bit
 of


a
 bounce.
 It
 was
 down
 10.
 Now
 it's
 down


8.5
 1.5%
 move
 right
 there.


Kind
 of
 holding.
 Okay.


Why
 do
 I
 think
 it's
 weird
 that
 Tesla's


up?
 Well,
 there's
 no
 headline
 for
 Tesla


and
 the
 Q's
 are
 down.
 So,
 like
 what's


pumping
 Tesla?
 Again,
 Tesla's
 a
 big
 part


of
 the
 NASDAQ,
 right?
 So,
 if
 the


NASDAQ's
 down
 and
 Tesla's
 going
 opposite


the
 NASDAQ,
 it's
 super
 bullish.
 Tesla,


but
 like
 why,
 I
 guess,
 is
 the
 question.


And
 I
 don't
 see
 a
 reason
 for
 why
 the


poem
 worked.


Okay,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 think
 of
 a
 poem


for
 Tesla.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do
 it.
 Not


going
 to
 do it.
 Even
 though
 my
 mind's


already
 running,
 but
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 do


it.
 But
 the
 attempt
 is
 what
 matters.


You
 got
 to
 try
 in
 life.


You
 have
 to
 try.


No,
 I
 don't
 see
 any
 headlines,
 dude.


Nothing
 for
 Tesla.
 Oh,
 I
 mean,
 someone


says
 FSD
 is
 solved.
 Look,
 I
 will
 say
 I


don't
 think
 it's
 pumping
 just
 because
 of


FSD
 today,
 but
 uh
 when
 I
 drove
 back
 from


my
 parents
 house
 this
 morning,
 again,


FSD
 is
 getting
 really
 good
 and
 it's


letting
 me
 check
 my
 phone
 more.
 like


13.9.
 Again,
 you
 try
 to
 check
 your


phone,
 it
 gets
 really
 like
 now
 it's
 like


you
 can
 actually
 like
 I
 think
 Tesla's


getting
 confident
 enough
 that
 they're


not
 going
 to
 crash
 that
 it's
 not


unsupervised,
 but
 they're
 not
 being
 as


crazy
 if
 you
 look
 at
 your
 phone,
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 Elon
 said
 his
 goal
 is


people
 should
 be
 able
 to
 text
 and
 drive


and
 not
 uh
 worry
 about
 anything.
 And


that's
 when
 there's
 a
 real
 unlock.
 So,


I'm
 loving
 14.2.
 Like,
 I'm
 absolutely


loving
 it.
 And
 it's
 just
 a
 joy
 to
 be
 in


that
 car.


Now,
 I
 don't
 think
 that's
 why
 the


stock's
 up
 today,
 but
 that
 is
 a


uh
 exciting
 reason
 for
 momentum
 going


into
 2026.
 3.3%.
 We
 did
 hit
 463.


We
 did
 hit
 463.


Peggy
 said,
 "I
 asked
 Gemini
 for
 a
 poem.


It
 wrote,
 "Roses
 are
 red,
 violets
 are


blue,
 the
 Dow
 is
 in
 the
 red,
 and
 so
 is


my
 portfolio,
 too."
 See,
 that's
 that's


not
 a
 horrible
 That's
 not
 a
 horrible


poem.


It
 makes
 sense,
 especially
 if
 your


portfolio
 is
 red.


It
 rhymes
 and
 it
 makes
 sense.
 PayPal


right
 there
 61.
 Adobe
 359.
 Then
 Tesla


462.
 Yes,
 Whimo
 is
 obviously
 putting
 up


better
 results
 than
 Tesla.
 We
 talked


about
 those
 yesterday.
 14
 million
 paid


trips.
 They're
 targeting
 1
 million
 paid


trips
 a
 week.


the
 argument
 from
 the
 Tesla
 bulls,
 which


is,
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 discount


this
 argument,
 but
 nonetheless,
 it
 is
 an


argument,
 which
 is
 um
 Tesla's
 FSD
 is


going
 to
 be
 so
 much
 better
 than
 anything


Whimo
 can
 come
 up
 with
 with
 what
 they're


doing
 with
 LiDAR
 that
 once
 they
 flip
 the


switch
 and
 you
 have
 millions
 of
 vehicles


on
 the
 road,
 it
 is
 going
 to
 wipe
 the


floor
 with
 Whimo
 because
 people
 are
 just


going
 to
 want
 to
 pick
 a
 robo
 taxi
 over
 a


Whimo.
 And
 Whimo
 has
 200
 vehicles
 doing


uh
 14
 million
 trips.
 Tesla's
 going
 to


have
 essentially
 in
 the
 bull
 case
 10


million
 vehicles
 doing
 a
 lot
 more
 than


14
 million
 trips.
 That
 is
 the
 bull
 case


for
 FSD.
 Now
 obviously
 there's
 going
 to


be
 a
 lot
 of
 nuance
 to
 that
 but
 I
 think


that
 is
 why
 Tesla
 continues
 to
 get
 this


get
 this
 premium
 rock
 lab
 right
 there
 we


touched
 65
 6455
 still
 up
 1.5%


on
 the
 day
 also
 substantially
 cheaper.


Yes.
 I
 mean,
 the
 cost
 per
 mile
 is
 going


to
 be
 the
 big
 competitive
 advantage,


which
 is
 why
 I
 think
 the
 street


continues
 to,
 you
 know,
 put
 up
 price


targets
 closer
 to
 500
 because
 they're


just
 like,
 look,
 the
 math
 makes
 sense.


It
 just
 has
 to
 work.
 And
 there's


probably
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 nuance
 to


the
 math
 once
 it
 gets
 rolling,
 but
 you


know,
 Tesla's
 really
 not
 at
 that
 Whimo


level
 scale
 yet,
 but
 once
 it
 gets
 there,


it
 should
 ramp
 up
 way
 faster
 than


Whimo's
 ramp.
 And
 then
 the
 question
 is,


do
 consumers
 pick
 it
 over
 Whimo?


which
 time
 will
 tell,


but
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 very
 important
 to


see
 how
 it
 plays
 out.


Netflix,


this
 one
 96


still
 holding
 2.5%.
 Remember,
 Netflix
 is


still
 down
 from
 130.
 So,
 this
 one
 has
 a


lot
 of
 room
 to
 go
 back
 higher
 if
 it
 ever


gets
 that
 premium
 premium
 multiple


again.
 Still
 trades
 at
 a
 40
 PE.
 It's
 not


like
 it's
 not
 getting
 a
 decent
 multiple


here,
 but
 it
 has
 erased
 most
 of
 the


gains
 of
 uh
 of
 2025.


Um,


serious
 question.
 What
 will
 happen
 in


times
 without
 demand
 when
 you're
 going


to
 have
 millions
 of
 robot
 tax
 and
 wayos


on
 the
 street?
 Well,
 there
 should
 always


be
 demand,
 right?
 Like
 if
 Uber's


earnings
 for
 the
 past
 10
 years
 has
 shown


us
 anything,
 transportation
 demand
 is


not
 slowing
 down.


and
 you
 got
 more
 and
 more
 people.
 I


mean,
 there
 is
 a
 macro
 argument
 for
 why


demand
 for
 a
 robo
 taxi
 should
 go
 higher.


I
 mean,
 we
 looked
 at
 it
 a
 couple
 days


ago.
 Uh,
 the
 cost
 to
 buy
 a
 car
 is


increasing.
 Average
 price
 for
 a
 car
 now


is
 50
 grand
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 So,


the
 idea
 that
 people
 just
 say,
 "Hey,
 you


know,
 if
 I
 can
 pay
 a
 dollar
 a
 mile,
 less


than
 a
 dollar
 a
 mile
 potentially,
 to
 get


to
 where
 I
 need
 to
 be
 in
 a
 in
 a
 very
 uh


private
 and
 safe
 experience
 versus
 buy


my
 own
 car
 and
 avoid
 the
 monthly
 payment


on
 it.


I
 mean,
 theoretically,
 demand
 should
 be


there."


Yeah.
 And
 then
 the
 whole
 argument
 that


the
 cars
 are
 going
 to
 be
 like
 data


centers
 when
 they're
 not
 being
 used
 that


are
 just


continuously
 training
 and
 essentially


being
 used
 for
 inference


which
 would
 actually
 be
 very
 exciting


for
 the
 overall
 thesis
 on
 making
 the
 AI


better
 and
 better
 for
 FS.


Um


Tesla
 still
 holding
 466
 Broad
 or
 462


Broadcom
 she's
 trying
 to
 hold
 370
 but


she's
 barely
 holding
 on.
 So
 Broadcom


Red,
 maybe
 that's
 enough
 of
 the
 pain.
 I


mean,
 is
 it
 really
 going
 down
 15%,
 10%


down
 on
 a
 $2
 trillion
 company
 is
 a
 lot.


I
 think
 you
 might
 have
 buyers
 stepping


in.
 AMD
 just
 went
 red.
 Core
 weave
 down


red.
 I
 ren's
 red.
 Then
 SoFi
 back
 to


green.


Yeah,
 Rivian
 did
 dump
 during
 the


announcement
 yesterday.
 Now
 it's
 pumping


today.
 I
 guess
 the
 market
 needed
 some


time.
 Wow,
 Rivian
 19
 bucks.
 You
 know,


Jason's
 gonna
 be
 happy.


Jason
 loves
 his
 ribbon,


so
 maybe
 we're
 seeing
 that.
 Hims
 also
 up


2.5%.


This
 one
 has
 been
 stuck
 under
 40
 for


like
 the
 past
 month.
 A
 lot
 of
 the


excitement
 has
 died
 down
 on
 HIMS.
 Uh


it's
 kind
 of
 crazy,
 right,
 how
 a
 stock


is
 like
 everyone's
 talking
 about
 it
 and


then
 boom,
 price
 action
 sucks
 and
 people


stop
 caring.
 That's
 almost
 exactly


what's
 happened
 with
 HIMS.
 PayPal
 right


there,
 6169.


And
 then
 UNH
 also
 making
 a
 little bit
 of


move
 right
 here,
 up
 2%.
 The
 uh
 the


Wall
 Street
 Journal
 reported
 that
 um


Congress
 is
 likely
 to
 take
 a
 vote
 on
 the


ACA
 subsidies
 next
 week
 to
 extend
 them,


which
 is
 super
 bullish.
 Oscar,
 UNH,
 CNC,


Eleance,
 all
 those
 companies,
 Oscar


right
 there,
 that
 look
 at
 that.
 Oscar's


up
 4%.


So
 if
 that
 vote
 gets
 extended


then


then
 that
 would
 be
 bullish
 for
 these
 uh


insurance
 companies.


Broadcom
 target
 is
 350
 then
 I'll
 buy.


Does
 anyone
 have
 a
 specific
 target
 on


this
 350?


I
 mean


I
 don't
 know if
 we
 see
 350
 dude.
 Now


granted,


Broadcom's
 still
 trading
 at
 a
 trailing


12
 months,
 77P,


I
 see
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 the


company
 to
 say
 if
 that's
 Nvidia
 is


trading
 at
 44
 times.
 Like
 this
 is
 like


and
 Nvidia
 is
 going
 faster
 than


Broadcom.
 This
 is
 this


is
 why
 I
 think
 some
 of
 that
 money
 might


rotate.
 It
 doesn't
 mean
 Broadcom


deserves
 to
 go
 to
 like
 300
 though.
 But


yeah,
 maybe
 350,


310,
 320.


350
 sounds
 about
 right
 for
 Broadcom.


See,
 the
 crazy
 thing
 is
 S&P
 is
 basically


687.
 Let's
 call
 it
 basically
 at
 all
 time


highs.
 689,
 690
 was
 alltime
 highs.
 It's


at
 basically
 alltime
 highs.
 Nvidia
 is


not
 at
 all
 time
 highs.
 Broadcom's
 down


10%.
 Oracle's
 down
 30%.
 Hoodiey's
 at


125.
 I
 mean,
 you
 got
 Tesla
 kind
 of


pushing
 alltime
 highs.
 So,
 I
 guess


that's
 consistent.
 Google's
 all-time


highs.
 That's
 pushing
 uh
 the
 consistency


and
 Apple.
 So,
 Tesla,
 Google,
 and
 Apple


are
 kind
 of
 matching
 the
 S&P
 price


action.
 Amazon's
 doing
 nothing.


Microsoft's
 been
 down
 for
 weeks.


Microsoft
 was
 at
 freaking
 550
 at
 one


point.
 It's
 at
 480
 now.
 Um,
 and
 Nvidia


is
 stuck
 at
 180,
 which
 just
 means


broadening
 is
 occurring,
 which
 is


healthy.
 It's
 just
 not
 necessarily


topheavy
 inside
 of
 tech.


Which,
 let
 me
 ask
 this
 question
 right


here
 because
 yeah,
 you
 know,
 I
 I'm


reading
 a
 lot
 more
 analyst
 reports
 and


and
 and
 this
 is
 the
 sort
 of
 take
 they're


going
 with
 it.
 It
 almost
 feels
 exactly


like
 2024,
 which
 which
 essentially
 was


um


do
 you
 think
 tech
 leads
 in
 2020?


I
 should
 not
 say
 tech,
 max
 7.


Do
 you
 think
 the
 Mag
 7
 leads


in
 2026,
 aka


the
 top
 seven
 companies
 of
 the
 world,


call
 it
 top
 10
 companies,
 whatever
 those


big
 tech
 companies,
 do
 they
 lead


performance
 next
 year?
 Which
 for
 the


most
 part
 they
 have
 this
 year?
 I
 mean,
 I


know
 Meta
 uh
 and
 and
 Amazon
 have
 been


flat,
 but
 Microsoft's
 still
 up
 for
 the


year.
 Google
 massive.
 Nvidia
 still
 35%.


That's
 a
 pretty
 massive
 move.
 And
 then


Tesla
 has
 done
 very
 well.


Uh,
 and
 then
 Apple,
 you
 know,
 Apple's


freaking
 all-time
 highs.
 So,


I
 don't
 think
 the
 MAG
 7
 trade
 didn't


work
 this
 year.
 It's
 just
 not
 all
 of


them
 participated.


And
 then
 if
 you
 include
 Broadcom
 and


Pounder
 in
 like
 the
 MAG
 10
 along
 with
 um


AMD,
 they
 all
 had
 a
 great
 year.
 So,
 if


you
 if
 you
 extended
 from
 7
 to
 10,
 I


mean,
 massive
 massive
 year
 for
 those


names.


Where's
 IWM
 for
 the
 year?
 IWM,
 a
 lot
 of


you
 guys
 saying
 small
 caps
 will
 lead


next
 year.
 IWM
 year
 to
 date
 is
 16.
 Yeah,


I
 mean
 IWM
 is
 neck
 and
 neck
 with
 you


can't
 say
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 that


said
 small
 caps
 are
 going to
 lead
 in


2025.
 That
 didn't
 happen.
 If
 anything,


small
 caps
 did
 exactly
 what
 the
 S&P
 did.


And
 you
 know,
 small
 caps
 are
 just


catching
 up
 to
 the
 S&P
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 thankfully
 because
 we
 got


the
 rate
 cut.
 But
 it's
 not
 like
 in


March,
 April,
 May,
 June,
 July,
 if
 you


were
 long
 small
 caps,
 you
 were
 getting
 a


better
 deal
 than
 for
 the
 risk
 you
 were


taking
 versus
 buying
 Nvidia
 at
 $100,


right?
 Or
 um
 Google
 at
 150.


So,
 I
 think
 that's
 going to
 be
 a
 big


theme
 next
 year
 of
 just
 like
 which
 one


ends
 up
 which
 one
 ends
 up
 leading.
 Uh


now,
 obviously,
 if
 you
 were
 in
 very


specific
 small
 caps,
 you've
 done
 well,


but
 this
 is
 what
 we
 were
 talking
 about


yesterday.
 I
 don't
 like
 IWM
 as
 a
 bucket.


I
 I
 like
 if
 you
 if
 you
 want
 zero
 like


due
 diligence
 on
 small
 caps
 and
 you're


just
 playing
 the
 thematic
 of
 lower


rates,
 debt
 being
 refinanced,
 and
 better


earnings
 growth,
 then
 yeah,
 but
 there's


a
 lot
 of
 junk
 in
 IWM.


So,
 I
 do
 think
 being
 selective
 here
 is


very
 important.
 Now,
 KRE,
 regional


banks,
 I
 think
 this
 is
 30%
 of
 IWM.
 This


has
 been
 doing
 great.
 So,
 you've
 had
 the


regional
 banks
 after
 that
 scare
 in


October
 of
 private
 credit,
 TFC
 pushing


50
 that
 have
 started
 to
 pick
 up.
 Also,


XBI,
 which
 is
 the
 biotech
 ETF.
 Uh,


biotechs
 are
 coming
 back.
 Now,
 I
 told


myself
 I
 can't
 touch
 biotechs
 because
 I


don't
 have
 a
 good
 history
 with
 them,
 and


I
 just
 think
 in
 general,
 you
 need
 to
 do


a
 lot
 of
 research.
 But
 if
 you
 just


trusted
 that
 the
 thematic
 would
 play


out,


double
 the
 S&P
 this
 year,
 35%.


You
 didn't
 have
 to
 know
 anything
 about


the
 drugs
 or
 what
 they're
 doing
 or
 the


patient
 trials.
 You
 just
 have
 to
 bet


that
 biotech
 would
 be


the
 uh
 the
 trade
 for
 this
 year.


But
 again,
 there's
 risk.
 There's
 a
 lot


of
 more
 risk
 to
 biotech.
 Celestica
 has


been
 a
 great
 stock
 this
 year.
 This
 is
 a


Canadian
 stock,
 which
 I
 found
 out
 about.


Why
 is
 it
 down
 9%?
 I
 don't
 know.
 It's
 up


242%
 for
 the
 year.


There's
 got
 to
 be
 some
 headline
 around


Celestica
 getting
 hit
 today.
 Is
 this


tied
 to
 Broadcom
 by
 any
 chance?
 Because


don't
 these
 guys


No,
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 is
 a
 Broadcom


thing.
 Maybe
 I'm
 wrong.
 I'll
 see
 if
 I


can
 find
 a
 headline
 here.
 But
 this
 is


down
 9%.


They
 are.
 See,
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 read


something
 a
 couple
 weeks
 ago
 that
 they


are
 tied
 to
 Broadcom.


I
 think
 there's
 some
 correlation
 inside


of
 their
 businesses.


Uh
 Rubric's
 getting
 dumped
 today.


RBRK.


Yeah,
 that's
 down
 5%.
 That
 did
 have
 a


massive
 move
 after
 earnings,
 20%.
 S&P


now
 actually
 going
 red.
 All right,
 this


like
 a
 legit
 candle
 on
 the
 S&P.


Wow,
 Broadcom,
 she's
 leading
 the
 way.


New
 low
 of
 the
 day
 again.


Guess
 Street's
 not
 done
 selling
 it
 out.


Street's
 not
 done
 selling
 it
 off
 yet.


Why
 is
 Tesla
 ripping?
 I
 do
 not
 know.
 I


wish
 I
 had
 an
 answer
 for
 that.


I
 wish
 I
 had
 an
 answer.
 If
 anyone
 has
 an


idea,
 let
 me
 know.
 But
 I
 don't
 see


anything
 for
 Tessy.


Okay,
 I'm
 taking
 off
 the
 scarf.
 It's


getting
 hot
 now.
 I
 was
 warm
 for
 the
 past


hour.
 Was
 warm
 for
 the
 past


hour.


Um,


let's
 see
 if
 we
 have
 any
 macro
 data


coming
 in.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 get
 consumer


sentiment
 today.


We
 had
 some
 Fed
 talk.
 Goulsby,
 we


listened
 or
 we
 we
 talked
 a
 little
 bit


about
 him
 in
 the
 morning.
 His
 Fed
 speak


was
 relatively
 dovish,
 not
 super


bearish.


Yeah,
 you're
 not
 seeing
 that
 many


conflicting
 headlines
 here
 outside
 of


Broadcom.
 Micron
 does
 not
 have
 earnings


today.
 Micron
 has
 earnings
 next
 week.


Yeah,
 it's
 a
 Friday.
 Usually
 most


companies
 don't
 have
 earnings
 on
 Friday.


Micron,


next
 week
 we
 have
 FedEx,
 Nike,
 Micron,


LAR,
 Accenture,
 Carnival
 Cruise.


So,
 those
 are
 the
 companies
 for
 next


week.


>> Uh,
 what
 was
 I
 gonna
 say?
 Um,
 what
 was
 I


just
 about
 to
 say?
 Oh,
 yeah.
 GPT
 came


out
 with
 a
 new
 model
 yesterday.
 GPT
 5.2.


So,
 by
 the
 way,
 Broadcom
 367.
 My


goodness.
 Still
 down
 10%.
 Um,
 the
 model


seems
 relatively
 bullish.
 It's
 beating


Gemini
 3
 on
 all
 the
 benchmarks.
 Um,
 I


haven't
 played
 with
 it
 too
 much,
 but
 you


do
 have
 a
 new
 model
 that
 came
 out,
 so


that
 could
 get
 the
 street
 potentially.


a
 bit
 more
 excited
 about
 the
 progress
 of


AI,
 but
 you're
 not
 seeing
 that
 reflected


today.
 Nvidia
 goes
 below
 180
 again.


I
 really
 wonder
 how
 we're
 going
 to
 how


we're
 going
 to
 set
 this
 up
 for
 the
 end


of
 the
 year.
 A
 lot
 of
 dicey
 action
 back


and
 forth.
 I
 think
 honestly
 I
 think
 the


simple
 way
 to
 explain
 today
 Broadcom's


taking
 it
 down.
 Broadcom
 again
 a
 new


intraday
 low.
 This
 thing
 is
 just
 the


falling
 knife
 right
 here.


I
 don't
 know.
 Maybe
 maybe
 this
 is
 where


the
 knife
 stops
 falling.
 But
 any
 buy


today
 has
 been
 not
 rewarded


level
 of


uh
 street
 support
 at
 this
 point.


Dude,
 is
 she
 about
 to
 go
 below
 367?


Goodness.
 9.5%.
 So
 that's
 what
 about


Yeah,
 about
 40
 billion
 market
 cap.


Um
 any
 interest
 in
 cyber
 security
 stocks


given
 how
 important
 they
 will
 be
 in
 AI?


Yes,
 I
 think
 there's
 a
 very
 important


correlation
 between
 the
 amount
 of


fishing
 attempts
 and
 just
 the
 nature
 of


how
 AI
 will
 be
 used
 to
 hack
 and
 uh


essentially
 weaponize
 against


corporations,
 sovereigns,
 etc.
 I
 just


don't
 know
 what's
 the
 best
 way
 to
 play


it.
 Like
 Crowd
 Strike
 has
 always
 been
 my


favorite,
 but
 Crowdstrike
 does
 trade
 at


aggressive
 multiple.
 PaloAlto
 is


obviously
 up
 there.
 The
 best
 ETF
 is
 HACK


if
 you
 just
 want
 to
 be
 long
 the
 sector,


the
 hack
 ETF.
 The
 problem
 with
 cyber


security
 is
 they're
 not
 growing
 like


those
 stocks.
 Like
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the


growth
 rates,
 it's
 like
 18%
 20%
 which
 is


amazing
 growth,
 but
 those
 are
 not
 like


60%
 80%
 40%.
 So,
 and
 they
 already
 trade


at
 multiples.
 So,
 they're
 not
 ex
 they're


like
 important
 in
 the
 portfolio,
 but
 I


don't
 think
 they're
 outperformers
 next


year
 in
 a
 meaningful
 way,
 especially


because
 they've
 done
 well
 this
 year,


unless
 they
 reacelerate
 growth,
 which
 I


would
 have
 to
 know
 a
 lot
 more
 about


cyber
 security
 to
 think
 that
 demand


would
 allow
 them
 to
 reacelerate
 that


aggressively.


But
 they
 are
 exciting
 names.
 Wow.
 New


low
 on
 Broadcom
 again.
 36640.


36640.


Okay.
 So,
 Street
 keeps
 selling
 it
 off.


It's
 30
 cents
 away
 from
 losing
 366.


Oh,
 by
 the
 way,
 ARC
 did
 buy
 like
 130,000


shares
 of
 Hood
 yesterday.
 So,
 they
 did


step
 in
 and
 they
 bought
 the
 dip
 on
 that.


I
 wonder
 I
 don't
 know if
 they
 own


Broadcom,
 but
 I
 wonder
 if
 they
 would


take
 advantage
 here.
 Google
 falling
 with


it.
 Good.
 But
 see,
 Google
 falling
 with


this
 is
 stupid.
 Like


Broadcom
 helps
 Google
 make
 the
 TPUs,
 but


Broadcom
 said
 nothing
 negative
 about
 the


TPUs.
 It's
 just
 because
 the
 street
 has


bucketed
 these
 two
 together.
 If


Broadcoms
 goes
 down,
 Google
 goes
 down.


But
 there's
 no
 real
 correlation
 in
 any


significant
 capacity
 given
 the
 earnings


call
 outside
 of
 the
 stock
 price.
 So,
 it


is
 weird
 that
 Google's
 getting
 hit,
 but


nonetheless,
 it
 is
 getting
 hit.
 Amcore


probably
 is
 down
 on
 the
 day
 as
 well


because
 of
 Broadcom.
 Yep.
 Amcore
 down


3%.
 They
 actually
 are
 a
 big
 Broadcom


supplier.
 So,
 um,
 that
 makes
 sense.


Robin
 right
 there
 down
 2%
 12147


as
 that
 goes
 red.


Uh,
 Restoration
 Hardware,
 I
 think
 they


beat
 on
 the
 top
 and
 the
 bottom.
 They're


up
 11%.
 So,
 this
 one
 got
 a
 bit
 of
 a


move,


which
 is
 nice.


Um,


that
 and
 Lululemon


are
 the
 ones
 that
 kind
 of
 are
 making
 a


move
 here
 today.


Netflix
 still
 holding.


Are
 Broadcom
 numbers
 bad?
 No.
 So,
 the


reason
 they're
 having
 a
 draw
 down
 for


for
 those
 that
 are
 still
 confused
 is


they
 said
 two
 things.
 Number
 one,
 their


their
 earnings
 for
 uh
 their
 revenue


guidance
 for
 nonAI
 revenues,
 which
 is


$4.5
 billion
 dollars,
 still
 a
 big
 part


of
 their
 business,
 that
 came
 in
 flat


year-over-year.
 They
 blamed
 it
 on


seasonality,
 but
 nonetheless,
 it's
 flat.


Number
 two,
 they
 didn't
 increase


guidance
 for
 AI
 revenues
 for
 next
 year.


They
 guided
 for
 Q1,
 but
 not
 for
 the
 full


year.
 So,
 Street's
 kind
 of
 wondering,


hey,
 you
 know,
 what's
 up?
 Why
 can't
 you


give
 us
 fully
 guidance?
 Number
 three,


and
 I
 think
 the
 most
 importantly,
 they


said
 OpenAI
 is
 not
 going
 to
 be
 paying


them
 a
 single
 dollar
 in
 2026.
 Now,
 they


could
 be
 sandbagging,


but
 given
 some
 of
 the
 concerns
 we've


seen
 about
 OpenAI
 maybe
 not
 having
 the


money,
 code
 red,
 yada
 yada,
 that
 maybe


OpenAI
 said,
 "Hey,
 we
 get
 need
 a
 year
 to


make
 some
 money
 before
 we
 commit
 to


building
 out
 10
 gigawatts
 with
 you


guys."


The
 scary
 thing
 is
 in
 2027,


if
 OpenAI
 comes
 out
 and
 says,
 "Yeah,


Broadcom,
 we
 actually
 aren't
 ready
 to


pay
 you
 yet."
 You
 know,
 that's
 when
 this


thing
 starts
 getting
 a
 little
 ugly.
 Same


thing
 with
 AMD.
 you
 know,
 they
 can
 make


that
 argument
 as
 well.
 Um,


there's
 actually
 a
 good
 take
 on
 this.


Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up
 right
 here
 of


something
 I
 agree
 with
 as
 well.
 But


yeah,
 I
 think
 that's
 the
 major
 reason's


down.


But
 the
 numbers
 themselves
 were,
 you


know,
 very
 very
 strong
 regardless.
 Yeah,


they
 did.
 They
 did.
 Oh
 yeah,
 that's
 the


other
 thing.
 Thank
 you
 for
 that
 comment.


Broadcom
 admitted
 that
 an
 XPU
 is
 not
 a


replacement
 for
 a
 GPU.
 They
 explicitly


said
 that.
 That's
 when
 they
 were
 talking


about
 the
 the
 ironwood
 TPUs
 as
 well.
 So,


they
 were
 kind
 of
 affirming
 Nvidia's


argument,
 which
 is
 that
 the
 A6
 are
 not


going
 to
 replace
 what
 Nvidia
 is
 doing


with
 GPUs,
 which
 is
 what
 Jensen's
 been


saying
 for
 10
 years
 now,
 and
 he
 keeps


saying
 it,
 and
 no
 one
 believes
 him,


but
 that
 was
 the
 argument
 that
 Brocom


made
 yesterday
 as
 well.


Uh,
 yes,
 VIX
 is
 still
 low,
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce.
 You're
 not


seeing
 a
 VIX
 spike,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 don't


know
 if
 the
 bears
 would
 be
 right
 to
 go


short
 right
 here.


Like
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 go
 short,
 it
 was


3%
 ago.
 Not
 at
 these
 levels,
 I
 think.


Just
 given
 you're
 not
 seeing
 volatility


cooperate.
 Nvidia
 bouncing
 from
 179.
 The


healthcare
 names
 are
 green.
 Rivian,


massive
 day
 16%.
 Netflix
 still
 pumping.


And
 then
 Rocklab
 still
 holding
 up
 as


well.
 Yeah,
 even
 Nebius
 is
 basically


flat,


which
 is
 not
 too
 crazy.
 Uh
 this
 was
 one


of the
 take
 I
 wanted
 to
 show
 people
 from


Steve
 Eisman
 yesterday


who


uh
 was
 instrumental
 when
 it
 came
 to


the
 uh
 the
 big
 short
 and
 I
 think
 this


argument
 here
 on
 the
 LM
 he's
 super


bullish
 AI
 but
 this
 is
 one
 concern
 that


I
 think
 is
 reasonable
 to
 make
 around
 the


nature
 of
 the
 hyperscaler
 revenue
 and


ultimately
 Nvidia's
 revenue


>> as
 they
 keep
 scaling
 which
 is
 the
 model


that
 everybody
 that
 he
 has


>> will
 start
 to
 lose
 their


efficaciousness.


>> And
 when
 I
 started
 reading
 him


>> nine
 months
 ago,
 he
 was
 the
 only
 one.


>> When
 you
 say
 lose
 it,
 what
 do
 you
 mean?


>> In
 other
 words,
 the
 the
 improvement
 will


gra
 will will
 slow
 as
 opposed
 to
 as


opposed
 to
 increase.


>> Okay.
 Which
 is
 against
 sort
 of
 the
 Sam


Alman
 and
 Dar
 against
 every everybody


else.
 And
 he
 was
 like
 a
 lone
 wolf.
 And
 I


read
 him
 because
 he
 was
 the
 only
 one


saying
 this.
 I
 figured,
 you
 know
 what?


I'll
 let
 me
 read
 this
 guy
 just
 just
 so
 I


know
 this
 this
 not
 my
 field
 of
 expertise


but
 but but
 he's
 different
 let
 me
 see


what
 he
 has
 to
 say
 so
 then
 chat
 GPT5


comes
 out
 and
 the
 immediate
 reaction
 by


all
 these
 people
 who
 know
 a
 hell
 of
 a


lot
 more
 than
 me
 is
 that
 the
 improvement


in
 chat
 GPT5
 is
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 lot
 less


over
 four
 than
 four
 was
 over
 three


>> okay


>> and
 then
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 look
 again
 it's


not
 my
 area
 of
 expertise
 but
 I
 I
 can


notice
 trends
 in
 argument


All
 of a
 sudden,
 Gary
 Marcus
 is
 not
 the


lone
 wolf
 anymore.


>> There
 was
 an
 interview
 maybe
 two
 weeks


ago
 with
 Ilasaver,


>> who
 was
 one
 of
 the
 founders
 of
 Open
 AI.


He's
 now
 founded
 his
 own
 company.


>> He
 comes
 out
 and
 he
 says
 exactly
 the


same
 thing


>> that
 that
 scaling
 LL
 models
 is
 a
 dead


end


>> and
 that
 we
 have
 to
 return
 to
 basic


research.
 And
 then
 a
 lot
 of
 other
 people


are
 starting
 to
 say
 the
 same
 thing.
 Now,


I'm
 not
 here
 to
 panic
 people,
 but
 if


this
 argument,
 the
 Gary
 Marcus
 argument


is
 right,
 you're
 going
 to
 start
 to
 see


more
 and
 more
 people
 start
 to
 say
 this.


And
 then
 at
 some
 point,
 you
 know,


companies
 like
 Microsoft,


if
 this
 becomes
 true,
 they're
 going
 to


start
 buying
 fewer
 chips.
 This
 is
 the


foundational
 argument
 that
 everybody


should
 be
 focused
 on
 all
 the
 time.
 It's


like
 the
 foundational
 argument
 before


the
 great
 financial
 crisis
 where
 I


eventually
 figured
 out
 that
 the
 entire


mortgage
 fixed
 income
 market
 rests
 had


rested
 on
 one
 assumption
 which
 was


housing
 prices
 can't
 go
 down
 and
 once


that
 assumption
 that
 pulled
 out
 the


whole
 edifice
 collapsed.
 So
 if
 look
 if
 I


I
 just
 run
 my
 own
 money
 these
 days.
 So


you
 know
 the
 amount
 of
 time
 it
 would


take
 me
 to
 alter
 my
 portfolio
 it
 would


literally
 be
 before
 I
 walk
 out
 this


door.
 But
 I'm
 not
 doing
 anything.
 I


still
 own
 the
 same
 I
 still
 own
 the
 same


I
 still
 the
 same
 I'm
 not
 doing
 anything.


I'm
 not
 selling
 anything.


>> But
 this
 argument
 makes
 me
 nervous
 and
 I


pay
 attention
 to
 it
 every
 day.


>> One
 of
 the


>> I
 think
 it's
 a
 fair
 point
 and
 and
 the


person
 he's
 citing
 is
 someone
 that
 has


not
 been
 the
 most
 bullish
 on
 LLMs
 in


general.
 Gary
 Marcus.
 So
 like
 there
 you


could
 there's
 definitely
 a
 little
 bit
 of


bias
 right
 there.
 Uh
 by
 the
 way
 I
 think


we're
 getting
 some
 new
 lows
 on
 the
 S&P


right
 there.
 There
 you
 go.
 68545


Broadcom.


Did
 we
 break
 366?


We
 touched
 it
 on
 the
 dot
 366
 then
 we


bounced.
 Um
 but
 there
 is
 an
 argument


that
 every
 additional
 model
 if
 it's
 not


substantially
 better
 than
 the
 previous


model
 then
 the
 question
 becomes
 do
 you


still
 have
 all
 the
 demand
 for
 the
 chips


for
 the
 AS6
 to
 be
 able
 to
 continuously


train
 these
 models
 and
 then
 as
 a
 result


do
 you
 need
 the
 hyperscalers
 to


continuously
 uh
 buy
 all
 these
 chips
 to


put
 in
 their
 data
 centers
 if
 the


previous
 models
 are
 accurate
 enough
 to


effectively
 run
 all
 the
 workloads.
 Um,


given
 the
 upgrades
 on
 Gemini
 3,
 GPT
 5.2,


everything
 that
 Claude
 is
 doing,
 Sonnet


4.5,
 like
 it
 feels
 like
 the
 models
 will


get
 better
 and
 better
 and
 better
 and
 it


feels
 like
 they
 do
 have
 a
 lot
 of


improvement
 to
 keep
 getting
 like
 they're


not
 perfect
 by
 any
 sense
 of
 the


imagination,
 but
 at
 some
 point,
 right,


that's
 the
 whole
 point
 of
 achieving
 AGI.


Now,
 Sam
 Alvin
 thinks
 he's
 going
 to


need$10
 trillion
 to
 achieve
 AGI,
 which


is
 why
 he
 has
 all
 these
 spending


commitments.
 Um,
 Google

 up

centers
 across
 the
 entire
 world.
 Amazon


investing
 65
 billion
 in

 centers
 as


of
 last
 week
 in

 different
 states.


like
 these
 companies
 are
 assuming


there's
 a
 long
 runway
 for
 training
 to


get
 to
 I
 don't
 know
 Gemini
 15
 or


whatever
 and
 then
 boom
 that's
 like
 the


best
 version
 of
 the
 model
 ever
 but
 if


that
 narrative
 breaks
 if
 that
 assumption


breaks
 which
 again
 is
 an
 important


assumption
 to
 challenge
 no matter
 how


bullish
 you
 are
 and
 I
 am
 very
 bullish


but
 you
 cannot
 ignore
 those
 fundamental


assumptions
 potentially
 cracking
 that
 is


where
 you
 might
 see


uh
 the
 overall
 argument
 for
 a
 chip


demand
 crack
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 the
 best


argument
 I
 think
 it
 a
 argument.
 I
 don't


think
 anything
 Broadcom
 said
 affirms


that
 argument.
 I
 think
 Oracle
 said


affirms
 that
 argument.
 I
 don't
 think
 any


of
 the
 hypers
 scale
 set
 affirms
 that


argument.
 And
 if
 anything,
 we
 have


minimum
 of
 a
 couple
 of
 years
 of
 a
 lot
 of


that
 chip
 demand
 not
 necessarily
 slowing


down
 anytime
 soon.
 TPU
 demand,
 async


demand,
 GPU
 demand,
 etc.
 MI450
 demand.


But
 as
 of
 now,
 I
 think
 that
 is,
 you


know,
 the
 argument
 that
 is
 there.


Um
 especially
 yeah
 you
 know
 given
 and


again
 the
 push
 back
 to
 the
 argument
 is


that
 Morgan
 Stanley
 said
 customers
 in


Asia
 are
 more
 concerned
 about
 if
 they


can
 get
 their
 hands
 on
 Blackwell
 and
 Bar


Rubin
 more
 than
 concerned
 about
 a


bubble.
 So
 right
 now
 the
 demand
 for
 the


training
 is
 just
 unbelievably
 massive.


And
 then
 you
 have
 to
 factor
 in
 what
 does


FSD
 at
 scale
 look
 like
 when
 we
 get


really
 unsupervised?
 How
 much
 training


does
 that
 need?
 What
 does
 robotics
 at


scale
 look
 like?


um
 lot
 of
 different
 potential
 agentic


workflows,
 agentic
 assistants
 that
 we


haven't
 even
 thought
 about
 where
 there's


not
 still
 a
 ma
 massive
 consumerf
 facing


AI
 application
 outside
 of
 GPT.


So
 if
 there
 is
 one
 maybe
 on
 a
 consumer


new
 hardware
 device
 or
 something
 all
 of


that
 is
 going
 to
 need
 a
 lot
 more


training.
 Rivian
 writer
 up
 17%.


And
 that
 is
 where
 that
 demand
 comes
 out


as
 well.


He
 was
 talking
 about
 five
 to
 10
 years


out.
 Yes.
 Which
 is
 why
 he's
 not
 selling


anything,
 right?
 because
 that
 argument


is
 too
 uh
 narrow-minded
 in
 and
 of
 itself


to
 go
 against
 the
 thematic,
 but
 it's
 an


argument
 nonetheless
 that
 you
 pay


attention
 to.
 It's
 just
 it's
 hard
 to


sell
 based
 on
 that
 argument
 unless


there's
 like
 really
 really
 hard
 data
 to


make
 the
 case.


Um,


all right.
 What
 else?
 What
 else?
 What


else
 do
 we
 have?


Obviously,
 we're
 red
 on
 the
 day.
 Also,


it's
 a
 Friday,
 dude.
 Market
 might
 just


want
 to
 sell
 off
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 it


because
 it's
 Friday.
 I
 mean
 it
 would
 not


surprise
 me
 if
 we
 reverse


but
 usually
 on
 Fridays
 we
 tend
 to
 expect


there
 was
 a
 string
 of
 I
 think
 I
 think


three
 months
 from
 like
 May
 to
 July
 where


every
 Friday
 we
 were
 hitting
 a
 new


all-time
 high.
 Now
 granted,
 we
 were


recovering
 from
 the
 liberation
 day
 lows,


but
 it's
 like
 every
 Friday,
 I
 just


remember
 the
 market
 closed,
 we
 were


ending
 green,
 and
 you
 know,
 you
 went


into
 the
 weekend
 relatively
 happy


because
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 happiness
 is
 tied


to


uh
 tied
 to
 the
 stock
 market.
 So,
 that


hasn't
 happened
 for
 the
 past
 couple


months.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 I
 think
 the


first
 week
 of
 October
 was
 the
 last
 time


that
 happened.


And
 then,
 yeah,
 Trump's
 soybean
 tweet


October
 10th,
 and
 then,
 you
 know,


everything
 changed.


But
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 if
 that
 ends
 up


playing
 out
 today
 on
 Friday.


Jason
 tweeted,
 "This
 is
 the
 time
 to
 buy


Nebus."


His
 text
 emit
 alert
 went
 off.


Oh,
 look.
 I
 have
 a
 full
 position
 in


Nebia,
 so


I
 am
 not
 really
 interested
 in
 DC
 in


here.
 Also,
 it's
 three
 bucks
 below
 my


average.
 Like,
 it's
 got
 to
 give
 me


something
 a
 bit
 more
 exciting
 to
 get


interested
 in.


But
 look,
 if
 if
 you
 don't
 have
 an
 Aby's


position
 and
 you're
 just
 in
 a
 data


centers,
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 these
 prices


are
 crazy.
 And
 I
 think
 Jason's
 right
 on


the
 TA,
 like
 these
 are
 the
 prices
 where


one
 would
 at least
 get
 interested.
 I


mean,
 if
 you're
 waiting
 for
 80,
 I
 think


that's
 too
 greedy.
 Um,
 if
 you're
 waiting


for
 75,
 I
 think
 that's
 really
 greedy,


but
 I
 also
 don't
 think
 you
 can
 expect


120,
 right?
 So,
 I
 think
 like
 this
 90
 to


95
 range
 is
 not
 crazy


to
 be
 buying
 here.
 It's
 just
 anytime
 you


get
 a
 bad
 data
 center
 headline,
 all


these
 stocks
 get
 hit
 together.


Unfortunately,
 Broadcom
 down
 10%
 ends
 up


being
 bearish
 for
 the
 for
 the
 data


center
 names.


I
 have
 a thousand
 shares,
 97
 average.


So,
 I
 mean,
 this
 thing's
 got
 to
 get


below
 90
 realistically
 closer
 to
 85
 to


get
 excited
 to


to
 buy
 the
 dip.
 Firm

 coming
 back
 a


little
 bit.
 Fermy
 right
 here

now.
 It's
 down

Tesla?
 No.
 463
 to

 So,
 this
 was


inevitable.
 S&P
 is
 down
 half
 a
 percent.


Q's
 down
 1%.
 Tesla's
 probably
 got
 to


come
 down
 with
 it.
 So,
 it's
 not
 red,


but
 it
 is
 down.

Oh
 my
 gosh.
 Could
 you
 imagine
 if
 we
 just


all
 went

 2022?

to478.


I
 mean,
 how
 many
 times
 do
 you
 find
 a


stock
 that
 100x's
 in
 two
 and
 a
 half


years?


4
 to
 478.


Crazy.


Trump
 is
 preparing
 to
 turn
 private


businesses
 to
 help
 mount
 offensive
 cyber


attacks
 against
 foreign
 adversaries,


potentially
 expanding
 a
 shadowy


electronic
 conflict.


Well,
 that's
 kind
 of
 consistent
 with
 the


cyber
 security
 stuff
 we
 were
 talking


about.
 Crowd
 Strike
 still
 down
 2%
 on


that
 headline.
 Trump
 preparing
 to
 turn


to
 private
 business
 to
 help
 mount


offensive
 cyber
 attacks.


Okay,
 BAR
 goes
 red.
 Uh,
 why
 did
 Tesla


pop
 today?
 I
 have
 no
 idea.
 Maybe
 because


of
 that
 AI
 executive
 order,
 but
 then


again,
 you
 would
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 AI


stocks
 would
 move
 on
 that.
 I
 mean,
 maybe


there's,
 you
 know,
 if
 FSD
 becomes
 a


federally
 regulated
 thing,
 then
 Elon


gets
 to
 sidestep


state-by-state
 legislation
 on


unsupervised
 self-driving.
 Maybe
 that
 is


the
 correlation
 between
 the
 Trump


executive
 order
 and
 like
 Tesla
 in
 in


particular
 benefiting
 from
 it.


But
 outside
 of
 that,
 not
 sure
 why


you
 would
 get
 a
 big
 move.


Uh
 the
 other
 interesting
 thing
 about


Broadcom
 getting
 hit
 like
 this
 is
 that


the
 street
 raised
 their
 price
 targets


across
 the
 board.
 Now
 in
 Oracle,
 they


lowered
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 price
 targets,
 but


on
 Broadcom,
 as
 you
 can
 see
 right
 here,


I
 mean,
 these
 are
 all
 well
 above
 400.
 So


TD
 Cohen
 450,
 Jeffrey's
 500,
 Goldman


Sachs
 450,
 Barkclay's
 500.
 I
 mean,


again,
 it
 wasn't
 a
 quarter
 that
 was


bearish.
 It's
 just
 some
 questions


weren't
 answered
 in
 the
 best
 way.


I
 think
 that's
 why
 you're
 seeing
 the


selloff.


Uh
 why
 is
 Amazon
 down?


It's
 good
 old
 Amazon.


Uh
 I
 guess
 you
 could
 say
 that
 their


stock
 price


isn't
 delivered


uh


in
 a
 fast
 manner.
 Aka,
 it's
 not
 prime


delivery


for
 it
 to
 go
 higher.


Again,
 the
 attempt
 is
 what
 counts
 in


life.
 The
 attempt
 is
 what
 counts.
 226,


that's
 down
 2%.
 I
 don't
 know.
 This
 one


every
 day
 is
 between
 225
 and
 230
 pretty


much.

Why
 is
 she
 so
 emotional,
 dude?
 At


alltime

 yesterday,
 now
 right
 back


down.


She
 needs
 to
 just
 pick
 a
 side
 so
 we
 can


have
 this
 stupid
 Santa
 Claus
 rally
 and


end
 out
 the
 year.


What
 if
 we
 all
 bake
 cookies?
 What
 if
 we


like
 all
 legit
 bake
 cookies
 on
 December


25th?
 Like
 we
 all
 agree
 to
 do
 that
 and


then
 metaphorically
 the
 market


recognizes
 that
 it's
 okay
 to
 to
 come
 to


town.


Maybe
 we
 need
 to
 do
 that.


Maybe
 we
 are
 like
 zero
 to
 four
 on
 our


attempts
 at
 poems
 this
 morning.
 Look,


going
 zero
 for
 four


means
 that
 you
 tried
 four
 times.
 That's


what
 matters.


That's
 what
 matters.


I
 think
 in
 life
 you
 have
 to
 try
 and
 you


have
 to
 have
 a
 certain
 number
 of


attempts
 where
 you
 realize
 when
 when
 you


need
 to
 pivot.


Like
 I
 was
 actually
 talking
 about
 this


with
 my
 mom
 yesterday
 and
 we
 were
 we


were
 talking
 about
 uh
 like
 kind
 of
 my


major
 in
 college
 and
 how
 I
 pivoted
 from


like
 computer
 science
 stuff
 because
 I


was
 just
 like
 I
 just
 knew
 like
 I
 wasn't


like
 I
 was
 0
 for
 one
 on
 one
 computer


science
 class.
 I
 didn't
 even
 wait.
 I


didn't
 even
 make
 four
 attempts.
 I
 got
 to


that
 midterm.
 I
 looked
 at
 that
 [ __ ]
 It


was
 like,
 what's
 the
 Python
 language
 for


this?
 I
 was
 like,
 I'm
 out.
 This
 is
 not


me.
 I
 took
 my
 L
 immediately
 and
 I
 moved


on.


Sometimes
 you
 got
 to
 be
 self-aware


enough
 to
 recognize


that
 many
 attempts
 at
 the
 goal
 are
 not


going
 to
 lead
 to
 any
 level
 of
 success


and
 you
 move
 forward.


But
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 humor,
 you
 know,
 I


think
 the
 probabilities
 of
 success
 are


higher,
 which
 is
 why
 I
 keep
 making
 the


attempts.
 And
 although
 it's
 0
 for
 four


today,


the
 point
 is
 it's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 0
 for


four
 forever.


Whereas
 like
 when
 I
 tried
 to
 sing
 back


in
 seventh
 grade
 at
 the
 talent
 show,
 I


was
 0
 for
 one.
 I
 probably
 should
 have


realized
 in
 seventh
 grade,
 you
 know,


this
 is
 time
 to
 pivot.
 I
 didn't
 pivot


until
 10th
 grade,
 but
 that,
 you
 know,


that
 should
 have
 been
 more
 apparent
 to


me
 that
 the
 music
 thing
 is
 not
 going
 to


work
 out.
 Broadcom
 low
 of
 day
 again,


364,


down
 10.2%.


down
 10.3%


10.14%
 on
 the
 day.


I
 mean
 I
 I
 I
 just
 feel
 like
 the
 S&P
 is


dumping
 with
 Broadcom
 here.
 There's
 not


a
 another
 major
 headline.
 AMD
 also
 down


two.
 Hoodie
 down
 two.
 Amcor
 down
 three.


Rubric
 down
 five.
 Why
 is
 Rubric
 down
 so


much?


Does
 Rubric
 have
 something
 to
 do
 with


Broadcom?
 Like
 that's
 weird.
 Celestea


down
 10.
 That's
 more
 Broadcom
 related.


Small
 cap's
 down
 half
 percent
 and
 then


Google


down
 1%.
 The
 Q's
 officially
 down
 1%.


Tesla
 is
 bound
 to
 go
 red
 at
 this
 point.


Where's
 Tesla?


I
 mean,
 it's
 holding
 on
 to
 1%.


I
 think
 that's
 good
 enough,
 but
 it's
 got


to
 really
 hold
 on
 to
 it
 here.


Um,


Dell
 increasing
 prices
 on
 December
 17th.


Is
 that
 what's
 affecting
 some
 of
 the


market
 today?
 Dell's
 down
 1%.


Isn't
 this
 good?
 That
 means
 Dell
 has


pricing
 power.
 This
 shouldn't
 be


bearish.
 That's
 like
 if
 Spotify


increases
 their
 prices,
 like
 unless
 the


street
 expects
 everyone
 to
 cancel,


that's
 bullish.


That
 is
 I
 don't
 think
 that
 would
 be


necessarily
 bad.
 The
 heat
 map,
 by
 the


way,
 on
 the
 day
 is
 pretty
 much
 uh


pretty
 much
 red
 across
 the
 board,
 except


for
 some
 of
 the
 consumer
 defensives
 that


are
 holding
 on.


Just
 blame
 it
 on
 tariffs.
 Yeah,
 maybe


today
 we
 can


maybe
 today
 we
 can
 just
 blame
 it
 on


tariffs.
 Um,
 let
 me
 pull
 up
 this
 heat


map.
 Warner
 Brothers
 shares
 holding
 on.


Bitcoin
 under
 91.
 Okay,
 there
 you
 go.


That's
 also
 starting
 to
 get
 your
 risk
 on


downside.


Fear
 and
 greed.
 We
 are
 at
 fear.
 We
 are


not
 at
 extreme
 fear.
 There's
 no
 way
 we'd


be
 at
 extreme
 fear.
 Wow.
 S&P
 683.
 Okay.


Broadcom
 gave
 up
 365
 again.
 36411.


All right.
 So,
 I
 guess
 the
 street
 was


ready
 to
 take
 down
 Broadcom.


Um,


okay.
 My
 computer
 is
 frozen,
 so
 you
 guys


can
 still
 see
 and
 hear
 me,
 but
 it
 needs


a
 second
 because
 I
 can't
 change
 the


screen.


Those
 data
 centers
 in
 New
 Jersey
 are


messing
 up
 everything.


Crypto's
 down.


10:30
 on
 the
 on
 the
 dot.
 Maybe
 time
 to


buy.
 Yeah,
 maybe
 that's
 the
 reversal.


Why
 is
 my
 screen
 not
 moving,
 bro?


Do
 I
 need
 to
 get
 a
 new
 computer
 again?


Wow.
 Broadcom
 363.


Yeah,
 you
 guys
 can't
 see
 it
 on
 screen.


It's
 still
 stuck
 on
 Dell,
 but


No,
 dude.
 It's
 still
 frozen.


All
 right,
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 wait


for
 a
 second.
 So
 cold
 the
 computer
 got


frozen.
 Exactly.


363
 now
 on
 Broadcom.


I
 think
 I
 have
 too
 many
 tabs
 open.
 But


this
 is
 like
 the
 highest
 quality
 Mac
 you


can
 buy
 if
 it
 can't
 handle
 freaking
 15


tabs.
 Like


what
 are
 we
 doing
 here?


What
 are
 we
 doing
 here?
 Dell
 prices


hiked
 linked
 to
 demand
 for
 memory
 chips


from
 Business
 Insider.
 Okay,
 so
 that


might
 mean
 their
 memory
 prices
 are
 Well,


that
 makes
 sense
 because
 there's
 been
 a


shortage
 of
 HBM.
 We've
 talked
 about
 that


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.
 So,
 if


they're
 getting
 price
 gouged,
 they
 might


have
 to
 price
 gouge
 consumers
 as
 well.


Still
 frozen.


Can
 we
 please
 move,
 Mr.
 MacBook?


Why
 did
 I
 pay
 $4,000
 for
 you?
 If
 you're


not
 going
 to
 operate,


kind
 of
 have
 a
 show
 to
 do.


It's
 never
 been
 It's
 done
 this
 before,


but
 it
 would
 be
 done
 in
 like
 10
 seconds.


This
 is
 like
 legit.
 It's
 stuck.


Frozen
 was
 a
 good
 movie.
 It
 was
 indeed
 a


good
 movie.


And
 uh


although
 I
 haven't
 watched
 the
 movie,


I've
 heard
 about
 the
 movie.


Okay,
 now
 we're
 back.
 We're
 back,
 baby.


We
 are
 back.
 We're
 good
 to
 go.


>> Okay,
 let's
 pull
 this.
 First
 of
 all,


let's
 close
 out
 some
 of
 these
 damn
 tabs,


dude.
 I
 I
 think
 I
 need
 to
 get
 an
 even


better
 computer
 than
 this.
 It's
 getting


ridiculous.
 Oh,
 the
 heat
 map.
 I
 was


going to
 show
 the
 heat
 map.
 Okay,
 let
 me


pull
 it
 up.
 Uh
 I
 do
 have
 multiple


computers
 and
 I
 it's
 just
 like
 sometimes


when
 you're
 on
 the
 same
 computer,
 you


know,
 you're
 looking
 at
 multiple
 tabs


and
 then
 it
 just
 bugs
 out.
 So,
 this
 is


the
 heat
 map.
 Healthcare
 is
 red.


Financials
 are
 red.
 Consumer
 or
 sorry,


green,
 consumers
 are
 green,
 consumer


defensives,
 real
 estate's
 green.
 Just


tech.


It's
 tech
 that's
 leading
 the
 way


to
 the
 downside.
 Um,


bro's
 looking
 for
 an
 excuse
 to
 spend


money
 at
 Apple.
 Dude,
 I
 don't
 I
 don't


like
 spending
 money
 at
 Apple.
 I
 just


like
 I
 like
 when
 [ __ ]
 works.
 When
 it


doesn't
 work,
 it
 gets
 annoying.


And
 hopefully
 this
 thing
 continues
 to


work.
 But
 there
 it
 is.
 There's
 Broadcom


36326.
 So
 there
 you
 go.
 Broadcom


11%
 on
 the
 day
 1.72
 trillion.
 Tesla
 very


close
 to
 going
 red
 now
 1.5
 down
 to8%.


Amcore
 getting
 hit.
 Hood
 way
 lower
 than


yesterday.
 Yesterday
 I
 think
 it
 bottomed


at
 122.
 Now
 it's
 at
 120.7.


Nvidia
 179.


Do
 we
 go
 shopping
 here
 guys?
 Do
 we
 go


shopping?


Even
 if
 it's
 a
 little
 nibble.


Or
 is
 this
 just
 falling
 knives
 across


the
 board?


Of
 course
 they
 had
 to
 do
 it
 on
 a
 Friday.


Of
 course
 they
 had
 to
 do
 it
 on
 a
 Friday.


179
 Nvidia.
 Celestica's
 down
 10.


Okay,
 let
 me
 see
 if
 I
 can
 pull
 some
 of


this
 up.
 Okay,
 for
 those
 that
 are
 going


shopping,
 put
 in
 the
 chat,
 what
 are
 you


buying?


What
 are
 you
 buying
 for?
 We
 did
 get
 our


Black
 Friday
 sale
 a
 week
 ahead
 of


schedule,


which
 was
 dream
 fear.
 Fear
 and
 greed


right
 now
 is
 at
 40.
 Let
 me
 pull
 this
 up.


We
 are
 at
 neutral.
 Oh,
 we
 are
 close
 to


fear.
 We're
 at
 neutral.
 I
 think
 another


1%
 down.
 We
 probably
 touch
 fear.


Hood
 meta.
 Soi
 poucher.
 I
 did
 buy
 well
 I


did
 buy
 Soofi
 on
 Monday
 at
 like
 2683
 or


something.


Dude,
 I
 was
 so
 tempted
 to
 sell
 my
 SoFi.


I
 was
 up
 some
 good
 money
 on
 SoFi.
 Like,


I
 bought
 a
 decent
 amount
 of
 SoFi
 on


Monday.
 I
 was
 upset.
 I
 was
 looking
 at


JPL,
 looking
 at
 the
 SoFi
 position,
 and
 I


was
 like,
 you
 know,
 I
 could
 just
 press


one
 button
 and
 just
 take
 this
 money
 and


run.
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 no,
 market
 loves


JPAL.
 He's
 even
 more
 dovish
 than


expected.
 This
 is
 SoFi's
 chance
 to
 make


a
 run
 to
 30.


And
 now
 we're
 at
 2677.


So
 who
 whoever
 traded
 JPAL
 press


conference


probably
 traded
 it
 correctly
 given
 this


price
 action.


I'm
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 Broadcoms
 people
 are


buying
 Broadcom.


I
 mean
 look
 10%
 down.
 You
 got
 to
 nibble


if
 you
 if
 you
 have
 if
 you
 a
 own
 the


stock
 or
 b
 you've
 been
 seriously
 looking


for
 an
 entry.
 Like
 I
 mean
 you
 don't
 get


10%
 down
 on
 a
 two
 trillion
 dollar


company
 that
 easily.
 So
 I
 definitely


don't
 blame
 people
 FOR
 NIBBLING.
 YO,
 WHY


DID
 Trade
 Desk
 get
 smacked
 yesterday?


It's
 up
 right
 now,
 but
 this
 stock,
 I


mean,
 talk
 about
 an
 absolute
 stinker.


Like,
 trade
 desk
 for
 the
 year
 is
 down


68%.
 It
 was
 at
 120
 on
 February
 4th,


bottomed
 at
 48
 in
 April,
 bounced
 up
 to


70,
 and
 then
 got
 to
 90
 on
 August
 5th,


and
 now
 it's
 at
 37.


just
 an
 ugly
 year
 and
 completely
 lop


lopsided
 with
 the
 the
 advertising
 uh


tech
 business
 going
 to
 basically
 met


Google
 and
 apploven
 over
 the
 trade
 desk


app
 right
 there
 down
 3%
 and
 I
 don't
 even


know
 if
 you
 could
 bottom
 fish
 on
 the


trade
 desk
 because
 it's
 like


theoretically
 70%
 down
 you
 should
 be


able
 to
 but


maybe
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 business
 is
 just


leaving
 to


other
 players
 in
 adtech
 I
 actually


talked
 to
 someone
 who
 worked
 at
 trade


desk
 like
 five
 months
 ago
 it's
 like


family
 friend.
 We
 were
 at
 some
 event
 and


he
 said,
 "I
 worked
 at
 Trade
 Dad."
 The


first
 time
 I
 met
 him,
 I
 was
 like, "Oh,


what
 do
 you
 think
 about
 the
 recent,
 you


know,
 decline?"
 And
 he
 was
 just
 like,


"Yeah,
 I
 mean,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 other


providers
 that
 just
 have
 better


proprietary
 data
 right
 now
 than
 us."
 So,


he
 was
 pretty
 honest
 about
 it
 and
 the


stock
 just
 hasn't
 recovered
 since
 then.


AMD
 right
 there
 at
 213
 down
 3.5,


AMCore
 down
 three.
 If
 Amcore
 blows
 for


goes
 below
 40,
 I
 probably
 buy
 again.
 I


don't
 know
 if
 we
 get
 it,
 but
 if
 we
 go


below
 40,
 I
 would
 definitely
 be
 excited


to
 buy
 at
 that
 38
 39
 level
 again.
 Apple


right
 there
 at
 278


as
 that's
 green
 as
 well.
 Where's


Duelingo?
 We're
 green
 on
 duel.
 Dualingo


is
 holding
 up,
 bro.
 That's
 crazy.
 What
 a


day.
 Tesla
 three
 bucks
 away
 from
 going


red.
 Crowd
 Strike
 down.
 Carvana's


all-time
 highs.
 Dolingo
 holding
 200.


Rocket
 Lab
 still
 holding
 the
 60s.


Ham's
 lost
 their
 pump.
 Nike
 is
 up
 a


little
 bit
 and
 then
 Broadcom's
 still


down
 10%.


Mitt,
 are
 you
 buying
 Robin
 Hood?


I
 don't
 know,
 man.
 Dude,
 I
 just


like
 I
 think
 this
 is
 a
 if
 you
 believe


S&P
 7000
 end
 of
 year,
 this
 is
 a
 very


easy
 spot
 to
 buy.
 Like
 this
 is
 not


complicated.
 This
 thing
 is
 going
 to
 be


above
 120.


The
 problem
 is
 there
 is
 a
 massive


correlation
 with
 Bitcoin
 and
 there's


also
 a
 correlation
 with
 the
 perception


of
 the
 bull
 market.
 And
 those
 two
 things


doesn't
 mean
 Hood
 has
 to
 go
 to
 $70.
 But


it
 also
 mean
 Hood
 does
 not
 have
 to
 make


really
 meaningfully
 make
 a
 move
 from


this
 120
 to
 130
 range
 unless
 you're


trading
 it
 for
 like
 a
 123
 sell,
 right?


If
 you
 buy
 a thousand
 shares
 at
 121,


sell
 it
 at
 123.
 Like
 yeah,
 I
 think


that's
 very
 possible
 at
 these
 levels.


And
 I
 think
 120
 has
 been
 really
 good


support,


but
 there's
 just
 a
 lot
 of
 volatility
 to


the
 stuff
 that
 it's
 correlated
 with.
 And


again,
 it's
 up
 2x
 for
 the
 year.
 So
 every


time,
 whether
 it's
 Nebius
 or
 Hood
 or
 a


Broadcom
 that's
 up
 a
 lot
 for
 the
 year,


these
 dips
 are
 opportunities,
 but
 these


dips
 have
 to
 be
 framed
 in
 the
 context
 of


the
 stock
 has
 made
 a
 run.
 It
 could
 keep


dipping
 and
 still
 be
 a
 massive
 winner


this
 year,
 and
 you
 just
 can't
 be
 that


upset.


But
 I
 also
 think
 this
 dip
 is
 stupid.


Like
 like
 why
 is
 it
 why


it's
 down
 because
 of
 Broadcom?
 Like
 I


get
 it,
 but
 that's
 not
 really
 an


exciting
 reason
 for
 it
 to
 be
 down.


S&P
 still
 down
 at
 685.
 Made
 a
 little
 bit


of
 a
 move
 off
 683.


Yeah,
 that's
 a
 good
 point.
 Super
 Bowl


prediction
 markets
 are
 going
 to
 be


massive
 for
 Hood
 going
 into
 Q1


as
 well.
 I
 mean,
 these
 guys
 are
 doing


three
 billion
 contracts
 a
 month.
 I
 I


think
 that's
 just
 going
 to
 keep
 scaling


and
 that
 can
 offset
 a
 lot
 of
 I
 mean,


dude,
 that's
 freaking
 90
 million
 a


quarter.
 That
 offsets
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff


that
 they
 may
 lose
 on
 options
 or
 crypto.


So,
 if
 anything,
 it
 keeps
 them
 stable,


which
 is
 what
 they
 need
 given
 the


multiple
 they're
 trading
 at.


JP
 Morgan
 getting
 a
 bounce.
 JPM
 318.


Okay,
 so
 that's
 green
 up
 from
 300.


That's
 a
 good
 point.
 You
 got
 the
 yes
 no


event
 on
 Monday.
 No,
 that's
 actually
 a


good
 point.


That's
 actually
 a
 good
 hood
 tends
 to


move
 on
 those
 events.


It
 does
 tend
 to
 move
 on
 those
 events.


See,
 the
 question
 is,
 is
 next
 week
 going


to
 be
 like
 a
 bearish
 week?
 Because
 if


it's
 a
 bearish
 week,
 it's
 not
 going
 to


matter.


But
 then
 again,
 if
 they
 announce
 some


really
 nice
 stuff,


that
 could
 be
 exciting.


So
 2675,
 Tesla
 449.
 Right
 now,
 I'm


looking
 to
 see
 do
 we
 get
 any
 bounce


because
 for
 forget
 hood,
 but
 any
 stock


right
 here,
 like
 can
 we
 get
 a


confirmation
 of
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 bounce


even
 if
 you
 have
 to
 buy
 at
 a
 higher


price
 so
 at
 least
 you
 don't
 get
 stuck
 in


a
 falling
 knife.
 And
 right
 now,
 we're


not
 really
 seeing


anything
 meaningful.
 I
 mean,
 maybe
 the


S&P
 $1
 move
 could
 be
 interpreted
 as
 a


bounce,
 but
 not
 substantial
 enough.
 Is


Palanteer,
 are
 we
 still
 holding
 180
 on


Palunteer?
 Palanteer


even
 Palanteer
 lows
 of
 the
 day.


181.


Do
 you
 like
 SoFi
 right
 here?
 I
 Yeah,
 I
 I


I
 als
 I
 I
 do
 think
 SoFi's
 been
 stuck


between
 25
 and
 30,
 and
 realistically
 26


and
 28
 has
 been
 the
 buy
 zone
 for
 me.


See,
 I
 don't
 hate
 it
 here.
 I
 am
 curious


though.
 Why
 the
 hell
 did
 they
 raise
 a


billion
 dollars?
 Dude,
 if
 not
 screws
 us


next
 year
 and
 they
 raise
 a
 billion
 for


no
 reason,
 which
 I
 can't
 imagine
 because


they're
 too
 smart
 to
 do
 that.
 But
 if


they're
 just
 raising
 money
 for
 zero,
 you


know,
 return
 for
 shareholders,
 that's


going
 to
 be
 really
 annoying.


It's
 just
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 believe
 that


rates
 are
 coming
 down,
 not
 has
 $500


million
 waiting
 for
 him
 in
 six
 months
 if


he
 can
 get
 the
 stock
 up.
 That
 they're


not
 being
 strategic
 here.


Um,


what
 date
 was
 your
 portfolio
 alltime


high?
 We
 talked
 about
 this
 yesterday.
 It


was
 October
 9th.
 That
 like
 October,


right?
 October
 12th.
 I
 think
 I
 think
 it


matches
 up
 for
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 I
 mean,


maybe
 some
 people
 recovered
 more


aggressively,
 but
 Robin,
 it's
 still


getting
 hit
 right
 here
 around
 that


October
 9th
 to
 October
 12th
 time.
 I


think
 it
 was
 alltime
 highs
 for
 a
 lot
 of


people.


And
 so
 that's
 when
 I
 think
 things
 were


up
 the
 most
 for
 people.


App
 690
 that
 one
 continues
 to
 go
 down.
 I


don't
 know
 that
 much
 about
 uh
 the


Medline
 IPO.
 Uh
 it's
 it's
 what
 40


billion.
 It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 relatively


strong
 IPO
 or
 relatively
 uh
 there's


going
 to
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 relative


attention
 towards
 it
 from
 what
 I've


heard.
 But
 I've
 not
 necessarily
 it
 and
 I


don't
 know
 if
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big


retail
 allocation
 either.


So,
 that's
 one
 to
 definitely
 look
 into
 a


little
 bit.


We've
 not
 looked
 at
 that
 yet.
 Let's
 get


a
 little
 bit
 of
 coverage
 on
 some
 of
 the


macro
 stuff
 here


and
 then
 we'll
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


ETH
 below
 3100
 up.


Yeah.
 See,
 that's
 going
 to
 annoy
 BMR,


Crypto,
 Micro
 Strategy,
 all
 those
 names.


Bitcoin
 right
 here,
 dude.
 Bitcoin
 was
 at


94
 when
 JPAL
 was
 talking.
 It's
 300
 bucks


away
 from
 being
 below
 90.
 ETH
 is
 90


bucks
 away
 from
 being
 below
 3,000,
 dude.


Just
 feels
 like
 falling
 knives
 right


now.
 Everywhere
 you're
 seeing,


>> that's
 why
 I
 highlight
 tariffs.
 What


does
 the
 inflation
 story
 look
 like
 next


year?
 Are
 we
 going
 to
 see
 peak
 tariffs?


Are
 companies
 going
 to
 keep
 pricing
 it,


passing
 it
 along?
 We're
 not
 passing
 it


along,
 absorbing
 it.
 You
 know,
 Bank
 of


America
 put
 out
 a
 survey.
 They


>> mentioned
 this
 with
 Kramer.
 Yes.


>> Yeah.
 So
 they
 ask
 all
 their
 analysts,


their
 sellside
 analysts
 who
 cover
 all


their
 companies,
 do
 you
 expect
 companies


to
 pass
 on
 a
 greater
 portion
 of
 tariffs


in
 the
 first
 half
 of
 26
 than
 they
 did
 in


the
 second
 half
 of
 25?
 You
 know,
 the
 on


the
 good
 news
 front,
 you
 know,
 the
 mo


the
 most
 the
 highest
 bar
 is
 not


impacted.
 So
 no.
 Um
 and
 there
 is
 a
 no,


but
 you
 know,
 there's
 definitely
 certain


percentages
 that
 say,
 you
 know,
 20%,
 a


little
 less
 than
 that
 says
 yes
 with
 no


gross
 margin
 expansion.
 And
 there's
 a


category
 that
 says
 yes
 with
 growth


margin
 expansion
 as
 well.
 And
 I
 think


part
 of
 what's
 in
 this
 survey
 is
 is
 that


AI
 is
 really
 working
 productivity
 gains


at
 the
 same
 time
 that
 some
 of
 these


negative
 margin
 impacts
 are
 happening


through
 tariffs.


>> Right.
 The
 other
 good
 question
 out
 of


BFA
 was
 u
 if
 tariffs
 basically
 if


there's
 no
 change
 in
 tariffs
 how
 many
 of


you
 expect
 selling
 prices
 to
 climb
 next


year
 and
 it's
 66%
 at
 two-thirds
 of


analysts
 twothirds
 of
 respondents


>> in
 terms
 of
 overall
 inflation
 and


prices.
 Yeah.
 But
 but
 it's
 overall
 an


optimistic
 view
 I
 think
 on
 company's


performance.
 50%
 say
 they
 expect
 margins


to
 increase.
 I
 would
 have
 thought
 that


would
 come
 more
 from
 the
 consumer
 paying


for
 higher
 tariffs,
 but
 those
 numbers


actually
 weren't
 that
 high.
 So,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 it's
 probably
 a
 little
 bit


more
 of
 the
 same
 of
 what
 we've
 seen
 in


the
 in
 these
 recent
 quarters,
 which
 are


pockets.
 If
 you're
 an
 RH,
 you're
 you're


struggling
 with
 tariffs
 and
 there
 are


questions
 there
 on
 the
 margin
 impact
 and


on
 the
 ability
 to
 to
 pass
 it
 on
 to
 the


consumer.
 But
 other
 companies,
 you
 know,


with
 big
 scale,
 like
 a
 Walmart,
 for


instance,
 they're
 they're
 able
 to


mitigate
 it
 and
 work
 out
 deals
 with


their
 suppliers.


>> Yeah,
 pretty
 fascinating.
 Meanwhile,


record
 highs
 today
 for
 the
 Dow
 once


again.
 Our
 next
 guest
 says,
 "Buy
 high


and
 sell
 low,
 the
 opposite
 of
 the
 old


Wall
 Street
 outage."
 Adam
 Parker,


founder
 and
 CEO
 of
 Trivari
 Research.


>> Um,


still
 not
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of
 clarity,


folks,
 on
 some
 of
 this
 downturn,


especially
 in
 crypto.
 A
 lot
 of
 it


Broadcom
 once
 again
 pretty
 close
 to
 lows


of
 the
 day.
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 tied


to
 potentially
 Broadcom
 and
 then


obviously
 it'd
 be
 just
 naturally
 being


Friday.
 So
 you're
 getting
 that
 sell
 off.


Now
 you
 know
 we
 did
 hit
 alltime
 highs


yesterday.
 I
 mean
 all-time
 highs
 are


bullish
 but
 alltime
 highs
 also
 need
 time


to
 consolidate
 and
 so
 today
 could
 also


be
 a
 phase
 of
 locking
 in
 that


consolidation.
 But
 Broadcom
 down
 10%
 is


not
 helping.


Although
 obviously,
 you
 know,
 none
 of


this
 feels
 net
 bearish
 in
 any
 capacity.


It's
 just
 one
 of
 those
 Fridays.


One
 of
 the
 Fridays
 tend
 to
 be
 a
 tossup.


Do
 we
 go
 green?
 Do
 we
 go
 red?
 Maybe
 this


flips
 by
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 Maybe
 it


doesn't.

to

 You're
 seeing
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


slight
 green
 candle
 coming
 in,
 but


nothing
 super
 super
 aggressive.
 They
 are


starting
 QE
 today.
 technically
 starting


QE


um
 with
 the
 buying
 of
 the
 40
 billion
 T


bills


and
 so


yeah
 that
 could
 now
 again
 I
 don't
 think


that's
 going to
 have
 a
 massive
 impact
 on


the
 market
 but
 just
 the
 broader


perception
 for
 market
 participants
 is


that
 liquidity
 is
 coming
 back
 into
 the


system
 too
 is
 important
 oh
 do
 we
 have


Lisa
 Sue
 live
 yeah
 let's
 go
 to
 Lisa
 Sue


let
 me
 pull
 this
 up


>> that
 you
 will
 end
 up
 with
 a
 better


product
 um
 overall
 and
 philosophically


uh
 I
 think
 you
 know
 from
 an
 AMD


standpoint
 um
 you
 know
 actually
 if
 I


think
 about
 you
 know
 throughout
 my


career
 I
 look
 at
 you
 know
 sort
 of
 the


different
 inflection
 points
 on


technology
 um
 things
 often
 start
 new


ideas
 often
 start
 in
 a
 closed


environment
 but
 when
 you
 actually
 think


about
 when
 they
 get
 big
 and
 when
 you


know
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 adopt
 uh
 you
 like


to
 be
 an
 open
 environment
 and
 you
 know


that's
 philosophically
 now
 let's
 talk


about
 the
 business
 aspects
 of
 it
 you


know
 the
 business
 aspects
 of
 it
 are,
 you


know,
 we
 all
 have
 to
 make
 choices
 of


where
 we
 invest.
 And
 do
 you
 want
 to


trust,
 you
 know,
 all
 of
 your
 crown


jewels
 and
 all
 of
 your
 data
 in
 a
 closed


ecosystem
 that,
 you
 know,
 may
 or
 may
 not


be
 the
 most
 competitive
 at
 any
 given


time
 or,
 you
 know,
 may
 have,
 you
 know,
 a


flaw
 or
 any
 of
 those
 things.
 Whereas,


you
 know,
 you
 in
 an
 open
 ecosystem,
 you


have
 choices.
 You
 can
 decide
 who
 is
 the


best
 at
 any
 given
 time.
 you
 can
 decide


uh
 if
 I
 have
 my
 data
 in
 a
 cloud


environment,
 I
 can
 easily
 move
 it
 to


another
 environment.
 Um
 if
 I
 have
 my


applications
 that
 are
 built
 on
 one
 chip,


if
 there's
 a
 better
 chip,
 you
 know,
 a


few
 years
 later,
 you
 can
 move,
 you
 know,


quickly.
 That's
 that's
 kind
 of
 the
 idea


of
 both.


>> What
 broadly
 speaking
 are
 the
 advantages


of
 open
 and
 let
 me
 throw
 one
 out
 for


example
 in
 a
 new
 technology.


>> Okay,
 so
 that
 seems
 to
 be
 a
 more
 general


interview
 with
 Lisa
 around
 open
 source


tech.
 Um,


but
 you're
 seeing
 that
 little
 bounce
 we


had
 like
 5
 minutes
 ago
 go
 right
 back


down.
 It's
 a
 very
 choppy
 back
 and
 forth.


It's
 not
 down
 to
 the
 lows
 of
 the
 day,


but
 it's
 not
 holding
 any
 of
 the
 momentum


that
 it
 had.
 Even
 ETH,
 she's
 really


fighting
 to
 hold
 3100
 right
 here.


Maybe
 10:30
 reverse
 slam
 maybe
 we
 see
 or


11
 a.m.
 reverse
 slam.
 The
 names
 that
 are


green
 though,
 Adobe,
 Restoration


Hardware,
 Lulu,
 and
 Dualingo.
 Adobe


actually
 getting
 a
 lot
 more
 love
 today


and
 then
 Broadcom
 kind
 of
 leading
 the


way
 down
 at
 10%.


What
 do
 we
 think
 for
 end
 of
 year,
 guys?


What
 do
 we
 think
 in
 S&P?
 Put
 in
 the


chat,
 what
 is
 your
 target?
 I
 mean,
 do
 we


still
 think
 7,000?


We
 still
 think
 it
 has
 a
 shot.
 end
 of


year


we
 got
 what


1
 point
 one
 less
 than
 1%
 no
 about
 1%
 to


get
 there


um
 and
 we
 have
 what
 two
 weeks


I
 don't
 know


I
 mean
 maybe
 it
 could
 happen
 really


quick
 and
 then
 it's
 just
 there
 or
 we


could
 oscillate
 around
 these
 levels
 and


just
 be
 stuck


By
 the
 way,
 IPOs
 again,
 private
 markets


just
 heating
 up.
 You're
 seeing
 a
 lot
 of


attention
 for
 the
 private
 markets,


private
 companies
 to
 become
 public.


SpaceX
 would
 be
 the
 highest
 IPO
 at
 1.5


trillion
 if
 that
 happens.


I
 see
 a
 lot
 of
 6900s.


I
 see
 a
 lot
 more
 6950
 6900s
 versus


7,000.


Tom
 Lee
 says
 7,700
 next
 year.
 He
 does


say
 7,000
 end
 of
 this


year
 again,
 but
 7
 thou
 it's
 like


psychologically
 7,000
 matters,
 but
 if


it's
 like
 6950
 versus
 7,
 like
 who
 cares,


right?
 Like
 that's
 that's
 not
 that
 big


of
 a
 deal.
 It's
 just
 the
 the
 narrative


has
 been
 for
 many
 many
 uh


many
 many
 months
 that
 7,000
 really
 feels


like
 a
 possibility.


But,
 you
 know,
 if
 we're
 like
 660
 or
 670,


that's
 a
 totally
 different
 question.


It's
 just
 do
 we
 have
 a
 chance
 to
 to
 get


above
 some
 of
 those
 levels.
 Uh
 by
 the


way,
 China
 is
 unveiling
 a
 $70
 billion


stimulus
 package
 for
 chip
 manufacturing


in
 the
 country.
 So
 that
 was
 another


piece
 of
 bullish
 headline
 for
 the
 AI


trade
 this
 morning.
 You
 have
 this
 piece


of
 news
 as
 well.
 China's
 overall
 goods


trade
 surplus
 is
 21%
 year-over-year
 to
 a


record
 1.1
 trillion.
 This
 is
 higher
 than


the
 last
 full
 year
 as
 well,
 tripling


since
 2019.
 So
 even
 though
 Trump
 has


tried
 to
 tariff
 the
 crap
 out
 of
 them,


the
 surplus
 with
 China
 continues
 to


increase
 dramatically.


Uh


we
 had
 a
 30%
 decline
 in
 shipments
 to
 the


US,
 which
 is
 the
 steepest
 since
 August.


It
 was
 the
 eighth
 consecutive
 month
 of


double
 digit
 declines.
 You
 would
 think


that
 surplus
 would
 potentially
 turn
 into


maybe
 not
 a
 deficit,
 but
 not
 be
 hitting


all-time
 highs
 on
 their
 surplus
 in


general,
 but
 it
 but
 it
 is.
 It
 just
 goes


to
 show
 how
 incredible
 China
 is
 as
 a


manufacturing
 hub
 and
 how,
 you
 know,


this
 is
 kind
 of
 why
 Trump
 calls
 up
 the


new
 Japanese
 prime
 minister
 and
 says,


"Hey,
 don't
 talk
 about
 Taiwan
 because


every
 country
 in
 the
 world
 is
 reliant
 on


China."


And


you
 can
 see
 that
 from
 their
 surplus


numbers,
 which
 means
 if
 anything
 happens


to
 China,
 every
 country
 is
 affected.


But
 you
 do
 have
 a
 surplus
 that
 continues


to
 gain
 momentum.


It
 was
 up
 8%
 for
 the
 EU.
 That's
 correct.


China
 is
 just
 a
 different
 animal
 when
 it


comes
 to
 manufacturing.


Um
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 have
 Dan
 I's


target
 for
 S&P
 next
 year.
 I
 don't
 think


he
 does
 S&P
 targets.
 He
 does
 more


individual
 targets,
 but
 he
 did
 say


Oracle
 is
 a
 buy
 the
 dip
 easily.


And
 he
 has
 been
 saying


that
 well
 no
 he
 technically
 he
 said
 20%


for
 the
 NASDAQ
 next
 year.
 So
 yeah,


technically
 he
 does
 think
 you
 have
 a
 20.


What
 how
 much
 is
 the
 NASDAQ
 up
 this


year?
 The
 Q's
 are
 up


21%.


Look,
 again,
 I
 mean,
 red
 day
 or
 green


day,
 like
 it's
 been
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 year,


dude.
 20%
 on
 the
 Q's,
 like
 which
 means
 a


lot
 of
 these
 individual
 stocks,
 Google,


Tesla,
 Apple,


obviously
 Nvidia,
 Broadcom,
 AMD,
 they've


done
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 20%.


So,
 it's
 not
 like
 it's
 been
 a
 horrible


year.


Uh,


should
 have
 put
 all
 my
 money
 on
 the
 Q's,


dude.
 Well,
 it
 I
 mean,
 again,
 for
 those


that
 don't
 care
 about
 individual
 stocks,


you
 pick
 the
 Q's
 20%
 in
 a
 year.
 Didn't


have
 to
 struggle
 too
 much
 or
 stress


about
 it
 too
 much
 either.


JP
 Morgan
 318,
 pounder
 181.
 I
 mean,
 you


are
 getting
 a
 little
 bounce
 here,
 but


it's
 not
 really
 sustaining
 like
 hood
 120


to
 121
 to
 122,
 right
 back
 to
 121.
 So,
 a


lot
 of
 these
 names,
 Apple
 kind
 of


holding
 at
 278.
 Google
 actually
 below


310.
 Wow.
 Lows
 of
 the
 day
 for
 the
 googs.


I
 would
 not
 want
 to
 see
 this
 go
 below


300
 just
 because


you
 can't
 be
 mad
 if
 it's
 below
 300.
 It's


still
 up
 a
 lot,
 but
 it's
 nice
 to
 see


Google
 hold
 these
 levels.
 Granted,
 get


to
 280,
 290,
 I
 feel
 like
 that
 becomes
 a


pretty
 exciting
 opportunity,
 especially


for
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 that
 maybe
 don't


have
 a
 heavy
 allocation
 to
 Google.


But
 if
 it's
 down
 because
 of
 TPUs,
 that's


kind
 of
 kind
 of
 dumb.


Can
 you
 short
 on
 Hood?
 Yeah,
 Hood


started
 unveiling
 shorting
 to
 a
 lot
 of


people.
 I
 don't
 have
 it
 yet,
 but
 um
 you


are
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 short
 on
 Hood


pretty
 soon


uh
 as
 it's
 rolling
 out
 to
 more
 people.


Steve's
 prediction
 for
 S&P
 by
 end
 of


year,
 well,
 he
 still
 thinks
 7,000.
 I


think
 for
 next
 year,
 he
 said
 8,000.


Now,
 he
 said
 he's
 going
 to
 make
 an


official
 prediction
 December
 31st,


but
 he
 did
 say
 he's
 leaning
 towards


8,000.
 And
 so
 are,
 you
 know,
 a
 couple
 of


the
 big
 banks
 that
 are
 also
 leading
 for


that.


How
 much
 are
 you
 down
 today?


Um


26
 26,000.


But
 is
 it
 not
 that
 bad?
 It's
 better
 than


waking
 up
 in
 no
 dude.
 Waking
 up
 in
 that


second
 to
 last
 week
 of
 November,
 it


would
 wake
 up
 and
 it'd
 be
 like
 it'd
 be


like,
 oh,
 like
 everything
 just


disappeared.
 It's
 like,
 okay,
 I
 guess


like
 abracadabra,
 the
 market's
 a


magician.


I
 guess
 it
 can
 all
 just
 like
 go
 away.


200,000
 down,
 300,000
 down,
 150,000.


Like
 those
 those
 days
 were
 ugly.


And
 again,
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 was
 caused
 on
 not


getting
 a
 rate
 cut.
 We
 got
 the
 freaking


rate
 cut.
 It
 was
 a
 dobish
 rate
 cut.


Stocks
 have
 relatively
 recovered
 to
 some


decent
 level.
 But
 this
 is
 why
 this
 is


why
 I
 was
 talking
 about
 yesterday.
 You


got
 to
 be
 grateful
 for
 whatever
 year-to-


date
 gains
 you
 have
 because
 and
 this
 is


why
 I'm
 saying
 it's
 a
 really
 good
 year.


Like
 we
 we
 we
 cannot
 discount.
 Yes,
 the


market
 may
 be
 down
 over
 the
 past
 couple


weeks,
 but
 you
 like
 if
 that
 is
 the


myopic
 perspective
 you
 have
 on
 the


market,
 it
 really
 from
 a
 mental
 health


perspective
 takes
 away
 a
 lot
 of
 the


gratitude
 you
 can
 have
 to
 have
 any


gains.
 Now,
 if
 you
 loaded
 up
 on


everything
 at
 all-time
 highs,
 that's
 a


different
 question.
 And
 at
 the
 end
 of


the
 day,
 everyone
 falls
 prey
 to
 that.


I've
 done
 that
 plenty
 of
 times.
 S&P,
 by


the
 way,
 low
 of
 the
 day
 again,
 683.
 And


that's
 a
 lesson
 that
 has
 to
 be
 learned


from
 like,
 hey,
 why
 did
 this
 price


attract
 you
 to
 to
 FOMO
 so
 deeply
 that


now
 you're
 holding
 a
 massive
 back
 and


that's
 just
 part
 of
 being
 an
 investor.


But
 if
 you
 bought
 during
 April,
 like
 a


lot
 of
 us,
 if
 you
 even
 freaking
 bought


all
 the
 way
 up
 until
 October,
 even
 if


you
 bought
 in
 August
 and
 September
 where


we
 only
 had
 one
 time
 where
 we
 had
 a
 1%


dip,
 we
 had
 six
 months
 in
 a
 row
 with
 not


even
 a
 single
 2%
 move
 on
 the
 S&P,
 then


you
 should
 still
 be
 up
 significantly
 for


the
 year.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 why
 it's
 like
 it's


been
 a
 hell
 of
 a
 year
 regardless
 of
 the


past
 couple
 months
 of
 or
 past
 couple


weeks
 of
 performance.


But
 it
 also
 goes
 to
 show
 you
 how
 quick


it
 can
 disappear,


which
 is
 why
 the
 gratitude
 is
 so


important.


140
 liquidated
 from
 the
 crypto
 markets


in
 the
 past
 60
 minutes.
 140
 million.


Okay,
 so
 a
 bunch
 of
 longs.
 Wow,
 look
 at


that
 candle
 on
 Bitcoin.
 917
 to
 90.1.


It's
 basically
 a
 $2,000
 candle.
 No,
 it's


actually
 92.5


to
 90.
 We
 have
 not
 touched
 below
 90,


folks.
 80
 bucks
 away
 from
 potentially


going
 below
 90.
 It's
 trying
 to
 hold
 on.


Be
 got
 people
 getting
 liquidated.


Mid,
 have
 you
 ever
 dreamed
 about
 the


stock
 market?
 Yes,
 I've
 dreamed
 about


CEOs


as
 well.
 I've
 been
 pretty
 transparent


about
 that.


Um,
 I
 don't
 remember
 any
 like
 specific


stock
 market
 dreams,
 but
 I've
 definitely


had
 them,


but
 they've
 showed
 up
 in
 my
 dream.
 It
 is


what
 it
 is.
 It
 happens.


Why
 is
 Bitcoin
 dumb?
 I
 think
 it's
 just


following
 Broadcom
 at
 this
 point.


Or
 what
 time
 is
 it
 in
 South
 Korea?
 Time


in
 South
 They're
 sleeping
 right
 now,


right?
 12:00
 a.m.
 All
 right.
 The
 Koreans


are
 going to
 wake
 up
 in
 seven
 hours.
 And


if
 Bitcoin's
 so
 ugly,
 they're
 going
 to


be
 dumping
 their
 or
 they
 as
 they
 sleep,


they
 might
 be
 getting
 liquidated
 from


their
 perpetual
 future
 contracts.


So,
 in
 the
 next
 seven
 hours,
 we'll
 see


how
 Asia
 reacts
 to
 everything.


Did
 you
 ever
 pitch
 grabbed
 to
 Tanner?


No,
 I
 need
 to
 do
 that.
 I
 need
 to


schedule
 a
 time
 for
 me
 to
 do
 it.


I
 should
 do
 that
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,


maybe
 going
 into
 2026.


But
 yeah,
 I
 still
 need
 to
 do
 that.
 He


did
 pitch
 chime
 on
 my
 show
 which
 has


done
 well.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 he
 got
 it
 at


16.
 It's
 up
 a
 decent
 chunk
 from
 that


level.
 40
 50%
 26.88
 right
 here,


which
 is
 not
 too
 bad.


Um,


Goulby,
 well,
 Goulby
 already
 talked
 in


the
 morning.
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 market's


reacting
 to
 Goulsby.


He
 said
 what
 he
 said
 in
 the
 morning.
 He


wasn't
 that
 hawkish,
 by
 the
 way.
 He
 was


He
 didn't
 want
 to
 cut,
 but
 it's
 not
 like


he's
 saying
 we
 shouldn't
 have
 any
 cuts


next
 year.
 It
 did
 surprise
 me,
 though.
 I


thought
 he
 was
 gonna
 be
 I
 thought


Goulsby
 was
 going
 to
 vote
 for
 the
 based


on
 what
 I've
 heard
 from
 him
 over
 the


past
 like
 month.


You
 know,
 you
 know what
 it
 reminds
 me


of?
 It
 reminds
 me
 of
 a
 like
 when
 I
 did


debate
 and
 you
 would
 have
 a
 judge
 in
 the


back
 of
 the
 room
 before
 the
 round


starts,
 you
 would
 ask
 the
 judge
 for


their
 paradigm.
 Like
 just
 ask
 the
 judge


for
 how
 they
 think
 about,
 you
 know,


arguments,
 all
 this
 stuff.
 There
 were


some
 specific
 questions
 I
 would
 ask
 to


get
 a
 gauge
 of
 how
 I
 would
 uh
 alter
 my


strategy.
 And
 they
 would
 say
 one
 thing


and
 then
 you
 think
 you're
 altering


towards
 how
 they
 how
 how
 they
 want
 you


to
 debate
 and
 then
 you
 lose
 the
 round


and
 they
 start
 giving
 their
 decision
 and


you're
 like,
 "Oh,
 they
 just
 screwed
 me."


Like
 they
 said
 they
 like
 this
 this
 and


then
 they
 completely
 went
 the
 opposite


direction.


And
 that's
 how
 Goulsby
 felt.
 Like
 in


October
 his
 interviews
 screamed
 rate
 cut


and
 then
 next
 thing
 you
 know
 he's
 like


yeah
 I
 think
 inflation's
 an
 issue.
 It's


like,
 okay,
 we
 didn't
 expect
 that.


Well,
 that's
 what
 happened.
 Bitcoin
 89.


There
 it
 is.
 89.8.
 Broadcom
 361.


S&P
 681.
 This
 is
 our
 dump
 hood
 below


120.
 This
 is
 our
 official.


That
 was
 an
 ugly
 red.
 Everything
 all
 at


once
 right
 there
 just
 fell.


Everything
 all
 at
 once.
 Like
 things
 were


tiptoeing
 around
 the
 red.
 That
 was
 a


complete
 okay,
 we
 fell
 off
 the
 cliff


right
 there,
 which
 tends
 to
 usually
 mark


a
 bottom,
 but


that
 might
 not
 happen
 because
 maybe


sentiment
 is
 getting
 a
 little
 ugly.


The
 question
 for
 all
 of
 us
 here
 is
 why


is
 this
 happening?
 And
 if
 it's
 because


of
 Broadcom,
 then
 okay,
 I
 guess.


But
 I
 don't
 really
 see
 any
 other


headlines
 creating
 that.
 Nvidia


definitely
 the
 algos
 once
 you
 have
 a


nasty
 dramatic
 fall
 altogether
 like


that.
 Nvidia,
 yep,
 Nvidia
 right
 back
 to


where
 it
 was
 two
 days
 ago.
 177
 even


after
 the
 China
 headlines
 this
 morning


about
 increased
 H200
 demand.
 It's
 like


none
 of
 it
 matters


now.
 It's
 in
 control
 of
 how
 the
 algos


are
 I
 guess


thinking
 of
 Broadcom
 as
 the
 catalyst
 for


all
 this


invades
 valuation
 is
 stupid
 here.
 No,
 I


I
 think
 so.


I
 mean
 like
 we're
 not,
 you
 know,
 we're


not
 fantasizing
 about
 their
 multiples.


It
 trades
 at
 24
 times.
 Like
 this
 is
 not


an
 expensive
 stock.


I
 think
 I
 think
 this
 if
 the
 Santa
 rally


happens,
 it's
 going
 to
 make
 us
 fight
 for


it.
 Very
 similar
 to
 last
 year.
 Last


year,
 December
 was
 not
 the
 most
 bullish.


It
 ended
 up
 being
 okay,
 but


after
 a
 really
 big
 year
 and
 a
 good
 run,


especially
 six
 months
 of
 not
 even
 a


single
 percent
 down
 on
 the
 S&P,
 I
 mean,


you're
 getting
 a
 choppy
 December.
 Now,


the
 other
 thing
 that's
 really
 important


to
 remember,
 I
 said
 this
 over
 and
 over


again,
 but
 um


one
 of
 the
 reasons
 December
 is
 good
 is


because
 September
 and
 October
 tend
 to


suck,
 which
 is
 why
 you
 end
 up
 getting
 a


rally
 in
 December.
 Or
 it's
 at least
 part


of
 the
 reason.
 Not
 saying
 that
 September


and
 October
 being
 really
 good
 uh
 this


time
 means
 that
 December
 doesn't
 have
 to


also
 be
 good,
 but
 historically
 you
 have


two
 months
 in
 a
 row that
 are
 bad.


November
 is
 kind
 of
 stable.
 Then


December
 ends
 up
 taking
 off.
 This
 time


November
 was
 still
 green.
 Although
 we


had
 to
 deal
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 [ __ ]
 in


November.
 November
 ended
 the
 month
 of


green.
 So
 September,
 October,
 and


November
 were
 still
 green.


Oh,
 hold
 on.
 We
 got
 the
 headline.
 This


should
 be
 the
 headline.
 Oracle
 or
 Oracle


down
 5%.
 Oracle
 data
 centers
 for
 OpenAI


delayed
 to
 2028
 from
 2027.


Oh
 boy.
 That'll
 do
 it.
 That'll
 do
 it.


That
 will
 freaking
 do
 it.
 Not
 confirmed


by
 Oracle.
 That's
 from
 Bloomberg.


That'll
 do
 it.
 This
 is
 exactly


what
 freaking


freaking
 Broadcom
 said
 yesterday,
 which


is
 that
 we
 are
 not
 going
 to
 get
 revenue


from
 Oracle
 or
 sorry
 from
 OpenAI
 until


2027.
 They
 explicitly
 said
 not
 in
 2026


and
 now
 you're
 seeing
 Oracle
 now.
 But


okay,
 but
 how
 do
 they
 get
 this


information?
 Who's
 confirming
 it?
 Where


did
 the
 headline
 come
 from?


Nebas
 is
 probably
 tanking
 on
 this.


Nebus,
 yep,
 Nebia's
 down
 three.


Coreweave
 down.


Corwe
 down
 6%.
 Goodness,
 dude.
 Well,


Corey,
 okay,
 so
 Cororeweave
 in


particular
 is
 exposed
 to
 this
 because


they
 have
 a
 big
 contract
 with
 OpenAI.


So,


I
 mean,
 it's
 basically
 saying
 the


revenue
 is
 delayed.
 It's
 not
 saying
 the


revenue
 is
 disappearing.
 The
 problem
 is


the
 market
 starts
 to
 wonder,
 well,
 if


it's
 delayed
 by
 a
 year
 or
 two,
 is
 it


ever
 going
 to
 end
 up
 coming?


And
 so
 yeah,
 I
 think
 Nebius
 and
 I


shouldn't
 be
 as
 exposed
 to
 this
 news
 as


Cororeweave
 and
 Oracle,


but
 Oracle
 right
 there
 down
 5%.


I
 don't
 think
 that's
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal,


though.
 Okay,
 so
 that
 that
 that
 when
 I'm


saying
 that'll
 do
 it,
 I
 I
 mean
 to
 say


that'll
 explain
 why,
 you
 know,
 we're


seeing
 this
 right
 like
 if
 we're
 looking


for
 a
 reason,
 that'll
 be
 your
 reason.


Is
 that
 that
 big
 of
 a
 deal?
 I
 mean,
 data


centers
 are
 hard
 to
 build.
 They
 take
 a


lot
 of
 time
 and
 energy.
 Like,
 okay,
 it's


delayed
 by
 a
 year.
 That
 means
 the


revenue
 is
 delayed
 by
 a
 year.
 Uh
 not
 the


most
 bullish,
 but
 intrinsically
 bearish


like
 thesis
 breaker
 bearish.
 No,
 I
 don't


think
 so.


Let
 me
 uh
 let's
 pull
 right
 here
 on
 the


Broadcom
 stuff.
 But
 that
 that
 seems
 to


be
 the
 the
 reason.
 Yeah,
 it
 could
 be


construction
 delay.
 It
 could
 be
 a
 lot
 of


things


for
 why
 we
 might
 be
 seeing
 that.
 But


nonetheless,
 the
 market's
 obviously


going
 to
 react
 to
 it.


>> Months
 while
 Nvidia
 flatline.
 So,
 doing


really
 well.
 But
 now,
 even
 this
 winner


is
 getting
 hit.
 And
 why
 do
 I
 say
 that?


Bernstein
 said,
 quote,
 "Stocks
 in
 the
 AI


space
 have
 suffered
 from
 investor
 angst


lately."
 As
 Broadcom
 selloff
 shows
 that


angst
 is
 just
 continuing.
 The
 issue


isn't
 necessarily
 execution,
 but


sustainability.
 Broadcom
 just
 doubled


its
 anthropic
 order
 to
 21
 billion
 in


rack
 shipments
 for
 the
 second
 half
 of


2026.
 That
 represents
 over
 40%
 of
 its


fullear
 AI
 revenue
 concentration
 in
 just


one
 customer.
 So,
 there's
 some
 concerns


about
 that.
 Morgan
 Stanley
 notes
 these


rack
 sales
 come
 with
 quote
 material


lower
 gross
 margins
 because
 Broadcom
 is


essentially
 just
 reselling
 components


think
 high
 uh
 memory
 prices
 from
 Google


other
 suppliers
 that
 it
 can't


necessarily
 mark
 up
 so
 it
 has
 to
 pass
 it


through.
 The
 company
 also
 announced
 a


fifth
 customer
 with
 $1
 billion
 in
 orders


for
 late
 2026.
 Analysts
 are
 speculating


it
 could
 be
 Apple,
 SoftBank,
 XAI,
 though


not
 OpenAI,
 which
 won't
 contribute


meaningfully
 until
 fiscal
 2027.
 And
 so


people
 were
 a
 little
 bit
 surprised
 about


that
 as
 well.
 So
 you
 have
 questions


about
 margin
 pressure,
 revenue


sustainability
 after
 that
 anthropic
 deal


goes
 through,
 AI
 revenue
 guide
 for
 2026


that
 was
 missing
 and
 whether
 this
 growth


is
 lumpy
 rather
 than
 durable
 and
 they're


all
 weighing
 on
 shares.
 But
 I'll
 end
 on


a
 more
 optimistic
 note
 because
 you
 have


many
 analysts
 Jeffre
 Wells
 Fargo
 and


their
 technoe
 just
 how
 wellowned
 this


stock
 was
 going
 into
 the
 print
 with


Gemini
 launch.
 And
 so
 today
 is
 just
 some


plain
 old
 profit
 taking.


guys.


>> Yeah,
 I
 saw
 a
 chart
 earlier
 about
 how


tough
 the
 setup
 was
 going
 to
 be
 going


in.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 a
 a
 look
 at
 the


Broadcom
 valuation
 against
 the
 Nvidia


valuation,
 the
 PE
 against
 each
 other
 at


the
 highest
 ever.
 So,
 there
 has
 been


this
 this
 trade.
 It's
 been
 a
 big


beneficiary
 of
 the
 Google
 versus
 OpenAI


trade
 as
 well
 in
 recent
 weeks.


>> Exactly.
 Exactly.
 So,
 there's
 a
 lot
 in


there.
 And
 then
 some
 people
 even
 say,


oh,
 the
 nonAI
 revenue
 wasn't
 it
 was
 a


little
 bit
 weaker.
 But
 you
 don't
 own


Broadcom
 for
 the
 nonAI
 story.
 to
 own
 it


for
 a
 business.
 Uh
 and
 that
 continues
 to


grow
 which
 we
 saw
 with
 the
 $73
 billion


backlog.
 So
 perhaps
 uh
 right
 now
 it's


just
 a
 matter
 of
 right
 the
 high


valuation
 and
 just
 very
 heavily
 owned


going
 into
 this.


>> Christina,
 thanks.
 Christina
 Ports


Neville
 is
 watching
 a
 very
 interesting


SP.


>> All
 right,
 that'll
 do
 it.
 That's
 your


headline.


I
 wonder
 how
 the
 market's
 going
 to


interpret
 this.
 Oracle
 bounced
 off
 185


but
 still
 ugly
 5%
 move.
 Nvidia's
 fallen


with
 it.
 Broadcom,
 here
 you
 go.
 359
 on


the
 table.
 11%
 359.
 There
 it
 is.
 Tesla


just
 went
 red.


That
 was
 expected.
 Um,
 pounder
 down


four.
 VIX
 up
 15.


So,
 either
 we


start
 to
 kind
 of
 maybe
 form
 a
 bottom


here
 or
 the
 VIX
 will
 continue
 to
 get
 a


spike.


And
 if
 we're
 spiking
 harder,
 then


this
 is
 definitely
 not


a
 bottom
 right
 now.
 Although


again,
 this
 is
 you
 look
 across
 the


board,
 you're
 seeing
 five
 to
 7%
 across


most
 names.


Does
 that
 go
 to
 7
 to
 10%
 or
 does
 that


stay
 right
 there
 off
 a
 Broadcom
 headline


or
 an
 Oracle
 headline?


I
 think
 that's
 the
 question.
 And
 the


point
 if
 this
 was
 Monday
 it'd
 be


different.
 This
 is
 a
 Friday
 so
 you
 know


things
 can
 tend
 to
 get
 ugly
 but
 things


can
 reverse
 really
 quick


on
 a
 Friday
 as
 well.


I
 mean
 but
 again
 but
 if
 the
 sort
 of
 core


argument
 is
 okay
 OpenAI
 is
 delaying
 data


center
 buildout
 like
 yes
 there's
 a


general
 fear
 that
 OpenAI
 doesn't
 have


the
 money
 but


that's
 different
 from
 saying
 OpenAI
 has


canled
 their
 data
 center
 buildout


contract
 with
 Oracle.
 That
 that's
 just
 a


different
 story.


So,


I
 don't
 know if
 it
 necessarily
 has
 to
 be


interpreted
 as


as
 bearish
 as
 the
 market
 might
 be


thinking.


Amazon.
 Goodness,
 dude.
 This
 stock
 226


once
 again
 red.


We
 have
 been
 talking
 about
 this
 for
 a


while
 though,
 right?
 Like
 I
 feel
 like
 I


feel
 like
 we've
 brought
 up
 the
 topic
 for


the
 past
 couple
 months
 now
 that
 opening


eye
 is
 a
 lynch
 pin
 and
 that's
 why
 the


Disney
 deal
 dude
 like
 I
 just
 I
 didn't


like
 it
 yesterday
 because
 just
 feels


cheesy
 and
 it
 feels
 like
 you
 know
 their


sides
 like


Disney
 characters
 on
 Sora


is
 not
 what
 this
 company
 needs
 right
 now


in
 my
 opinion
 from
 a
 growth
 perspective.


They
 need
 to
 prove
 to
 the
 market
 they


can
 pay
 for
 all
 this
 stuff.


And
 maybe
 this
 is
 my
 subjective
 bias


coming
 in,
 but
 like
 AI
 slop
 on
 Sora


is
 not
 going
 to
 move
 the
 needle.
 Like


the
 monetization
 aspect
 of
 that,
 like
 we


don't
 I'd
 rather
 them
 heavily
 invest
 in


the
 enterprise
 where
 the
 real
 money
 is


instead
 of
 Disney
 characters.
 So
 that


you
 can
 give
 the
 market
 a
 little
 bit


more
 confirmation
 that
 yes,
 we
 have
 the


money
 to
 pay
 for
 all
 this
 stuff
 because


if
 you
 don't
 have
 the
 money
 to
 pay
 for


this
 [ __ ]
 and
 again,
 Broadcom
 yesterday


said
 OpenAI
 doesn't
 have
 the
 money
 to


pay
 us
 in
 2026,


then
 it
 just
 starts
 to
 bring
 up
 a
 lot


more
 questions.


And
 we
 need
 many
 answers


instead
 of
 questions.
 It's
 not
 good
 for


Disney
 either.
 Yeah,
 I
 read
 a
 couple


analyst
 reports
 yesterday
 that
 weren't


the
 most
 bullish
 on
 it.
 They
 didn't


downgrade
 Disney
 or
 anything,
 but
 they


did
 say
 like,


you
 know,
 we
 we
 we're we're
 not
 fully


confident
 that
 uh
 the
 ability
 for
 the


intellectual
 property
 to
 be
 used
 in
 a


what's
 the
 word
 they
 use?
 basically
 like


a
 safe
 way
 that
 that
 that
 doesn't
 fall


prey
 to
 the
 to
 the
 guardrails
 is
 going


to
 be
 net
 positive
 for
 for
 Disney's


long-term
 IP.


And
 so
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 the


broader
 question
 that
 they
 have
 going


into
 next
 year.
 Let
 me
 get
 the
 part
 I'm


going
 to
 go
 to
 Broadcom's
 call
 right


now.
 Yeah,
 here
 it
 is.
 This
 is
 uh
 this


is
 what
 they
 had
 to
 say
 explicitly
 about


opening
 eye.
 This
 is
 when
 the
 stock


really


took
 a
 took
 a
 dip
 yesterday


>> and
 uh
 let's
 leave
 it
 at
 that.
 As
 far
 as


the
 open
 AI


view
 that
 you
 have,
 I
 we
 appreciate
 the


fact
 that
 it
 is
 a
 multi-year
 journey


that
 will
 run
 through
 29
 as
 our
 uh
 press


release
 with
 open
 AAI
 showed
 10
 gawatt


between


uh
 26
 more
 more
 like
 27
 28
 29


uh
 Ben
 not
 26
 it's
 more
 like
 27
 7
 28
 29


10
 gawatt
 that
 was
 the
 open
 AI


discussion
 and
 that's


uh
 I
 call
 it
 an
 agreement
 an
 alignment


of
 where
 we're
 headed
 with
 respect
 to
 a


very
 respected
 and
 valued
 customer
 open


AI.


>> So
 there
 you
 go.
 He's
 saying
 2027
 2028


2029
 not
 2026
 which
 again
 isn't
 crazy


because
 they're
 building
 out
 custom


chips
 and
 data
 centers.
 Like
 that
 stuff


takes
 time.
 Like
 yeah,
 it
 probably
 is


going
 to
 take
 longer
 than
 a
 year,
 but


the
 street
 was
 pricing
 Broadcom
 for
 it


happening
 tomorrow
 essentially.
 Same


thing
 with
 Oracle.
 Nvidia
 low
 of
 day


176.
 Bitcoin
 low
 of
 day
 897.
 Broadcom


low
 of
 day
 35950.


Down
 11.5%.


Nebus
 below
 90.


Uh
 SPY


are
 we
 going to
 go
 below
 680?
 I
 don't


know,
 but
 SPY
 is
 down
 as
 well.
 Amcor,


are
 we
 holding
 45
 44?
 Okay,
 that's


reasonable.
 Down
 5%.
 I
 actually
 wouldn't


mind
 if
 Amcore
 goes
 below
 40.


Conviction
 has
 only
 increased
 on
 this.


So,
 we
 do
 get
 a
 dip
 then
 I
 wouldn't
 be


that
 upset
 on
 that
 one.
 But
 yeah,
 that
 I


mean
 obviously
 that
 one's
 going
 to
 take


a
 hit.
 SoFi
 down
 two,
 Dell
 down
 four.


Dude,
 these
 prices
 are
 way
 lower
 than


what
 we
 saw
 even
 before
 JPAL
 spoke.
 So,


we're
 talking
 about
 kind
 of
 lows
 for
 the


week
 for
 for
 I
 mean
 mostly
 so
 far
 was


not
 at
 2640
 this
 week.
 This
 is
 first


time
 this
 week
 I'm
 seeing
 it
 get
 to
 the


low
 26s.


Uh
 by
 the
 way,
 the
 Trump
 headline
 as


well
 about
 he
 it
 looks
 like
 he's
 going


to
 be
 making
 the
 the
 weed
 classification


legal
 today.
 Tillray
 still
 holding
 30%.


So,
 the
 weed
 stocks
 MSOS


looks
 like
 that
 rumor
 is
 true.
 We'll


find
 out
 later
 today,
 but
 executive


order
 might
 continue
 to
 keep
 the
 weed


stocks
 alive.


Oracle
 delayed
 several
 OpenAI
 related


data
 centers
 from
 2027
 to
 2028
 due
 to


labor
 and
 material
 shortages.
 The


facilities
 are
 part
 of
 a
 300
 billion


agreement
 to
 supply
 computing
 power
 to


OpenAI.


Labor
 and
 material
 shortages.


Okay,
 so
 they're
 saying
 they
 don't
 have


enough


physical
 logistics
 to
 set
 up
 the
 data


centers
 and
 they
 don't
 have
 enough


people
 to
 help
 build
 the
 data
 centers.


Look,
 that's
 a
 way
 better
 reason
 than


saying
 we
 don't
 need
 the
 data
 centers


because
 we
 don't
 have
 as
 much
 demand.


So
 technically,


yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 the
 market
 should


care
 that
 much
 about
 that.
 But


it's
 the
 market
 that's
 going
 to
 react
 to


this
 stuff.
 This
 feels
 like
 a
 buy
 the


dip
 though,
 dude.
 Like
 it
 really
 I
 mean


I
 don't know
 if
 it
 recovers
 today,
 but


if
 that's
 the
 headline.
 This
 reminds
 me


of
 the
 information
 headline
 from
 a
 month


ago
 where
 it
 said
 Oracle's
 margins
 are


going
 to
 go
 down
 because
 of
 their


investments
 in
 data
 centers.
 And
 it's


like,
 yeah,
 obviously
 their
 margins
 are


going
 to
 go
 down,
 but
 like
 the
 point
 is


there's
 a
 massive
 growth
 opportunity


here.
 And
 they
 were
 even
 wrong
 on
 the


number
 for
 their
 margin
 decline.
 And


then
 Oracle
 was
 down
 like
 7%
 that
 day.


But
 that
 just
 wasn't
 the
 biggest
 deal
 in


the
 world.


So
 by
 cement
 producers
 and
 rack
 makers.


Yeah,
 maybe
 that's
 what
 we
 need
 to
 do.


Um


facilities
 are
 part
 of
 a
 $300
 billion


agreement
 to
 supply
 computing
 to
 open


eye.
 Both
 companies
 declined
 to
 comment.


Oracle
 CEO
 still
 said
 timelines
 remain


ambitious.


Where's
 Oaklo?
 Yeah,
 where
 is
 Oaklo?


Oaklo
 right
 here.


Oaklo.
 Wow,
 dude.
 Down
 9%.


I
 mean
 there
 could
 you
 can
 make
 a


correlation
 that
 if
 OPLO
 potentially
 was


part
 of
 supplying
 the
 power
 for
 any
 of


these
 new
 Oracle
 OpenAI
 data
 centers


which
 I'm
 just
 speculating
 there
 but


imagine
 they
 were
 and
 it
 gets
 delayed


then


although
 OGO's
 timeline
 is
 already
 like


a
 decade
 out
 like
 that
 that
 might
 just


further
 complicate


their
 ability
 to
 keep
 yeah
 Oaklo
 2050


did
 what
 was
 that
 who
 was
 that
 analyst


who
 who
 said
 we
 think
 who
 was
 using
 like


some
 2050
 number
 for
 Oaklo


Let's
 get
 some
 coverage
 on
 the
 Oracle


stuff.
 But
 there
 was
 some
 analyst
 that


came
 out
 and
 said
 that
 they're
 like
 2075


we
 think
 Oaklo
 is
 going
 to
 be
 amazing.


And
 they
 were
 like
 discounting
 the


multip
 like
 what
 the
 heck
 is
 going
 on?


Okay,
 this
 is
 the
 uh
 this
 is
 the


coverage
 on
 on
 Oracle


>> 2027.
 Now
 that's
 according
 to
 Bloomberg


attributing
 the
 delays
 to
 labor
 and


material
 shortages.
 Separately,
 there's


a
 new
 10Q
 that
 was
 filed
 from
 Oracle


that
 actually
 shows
 more
 data
 center


leases
 from
 the
 company.
 A
 credit


investor
 I
 spoke
 to
 tells
 me
 that
 this


number
 increases
 the
 likelihood
 of


Oracle
 going
 to
 the
 debt
 market
 sooner


than
 expected.
 The
 estimate
 was
 halfway


through
 2026
 according
 to
 people
 who


follow
 this
 company.
 But
 now,
 this


credit
 investor
 says
 it
 would
 likely


happen
 earlier
 next
 year.
 I
 reach


>> Okay,
 so
 there's
 two
 parts
 of
 this.
 If


there's
 in
 the
 10
 Q
 more
 data
 center


leasing,
 that's
 super
 bullish
 for
 all


the
 reasons
 for
 why
 the
 data
 center


thesis
 is
 playing
 out.
 But
 it
 means


they're
 going
 to
 have
 to
 issue
 a
 lot


more
 debt


and
 that's
 why
 it's
 at least
 on
 the


credit
 market
 technically
 bearish.
 So


that
 along
 with
 the
 OpenAI
 news
 I
 guess


is
 why
 you're
 seeing
 the
 decline
 right


here.


>> Out
 to
 Oracle
 for
 comment.
 We
 are


looking
 at
 shares
 of
 Oracle
 trade
 lower


once
 again
 down
 5%
 after
 losing
 10%


yesterday.
 And
 we've
 been
 seeing
 this


interesting
 correlation
 between
 the


stock
 and
 the
 credit
 default
 swap
 which


is
 once
 again
 moving
 higher
 today.
 So


keep
 in
 mind
 just
 how
 the
 story
 involves


not
 just
 the
 move
 in
 the
 stock
 but
 what


the
 credit
 story
 how
 that's
 influencing


where
 the
 stock
 is
 moving.
 Uh
 we'll
 keep


an
 eye
 on
 this
 one
 guys.


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 really
 not
 great
 into
 a


tape
 that
 was
 already
 read.
 Um
 and
 and


down
 Broadcom
 down
 10%.
 Thank
 you,
 Sema.


Sema
 Modi,
 um,
 Open
 AI
 delaying
 some


data
 centers
 report
 there
 for
 Oracle
 to


2028.
 Mike
 Sani
 joins
 us
 here
 at
 Post9


as
 the
 broader
 markets
 take
 a
 leg
 lower.


We're
 near
 session
 lows.
 What
 do
 you


think
 is
 troubling
 the
 market?


>> Um,
 well,
 certainly
 this,
 right?
 So,
 it


sort
 of
 scrapes
 against
 this
 sort
 of
 raw


spot
 in
 the
 market,
 which
 is
 the
 whole


open
 AI
 ecosystem.
 And
 then
 it
 comes
 on


a
 day
 when
 the
 areas
 of
 tech
 where
 we've


been
 taking
 shelter
 which
 is
 the


alphabet
 complex
 and
 Broadcom
 and
 the


custom
 chip
 side
 is
 also
 under
 some


pressure.
 I
 think
 the
 bigger
 point
 is


the
 rotation
 we've
 been
 benefiting
 from


all
 week
 which
 is
 you
 know
 out
 of


secular
 growth
 tech
 AI
 into
 cyclicals


and
 small
 caps
 and
 all
 the
 real
 economy


stuff.
 It's
 just
 never
 going
 to
 be


seamless
 and
 it's
 never
 going
 to
 be


always
 ele
 uh
 elegant
 and
 without


friction.
 And
 I
 always
 kind
 of
 have
 a
 be


careful
 what
 you
 wish
 for
 thing.


Everyone
 wants
 a
 broadening
 market.
 This


is
 what
 happens,
 right?
 You
 you're
 not


you
 don't
 have
 open-ended
 upside
 in


valuations
 for
 non-
 tech
 companies
 that


can
 just
 sort
 of
 instantly
 take
 up
 the


slack.
 I
 don't
 think
 really
 it's
 changed


the
 whole
 story.
 We
 still
 actually
 have


stronger
 action
 today
 in
 non
 tech
 parts


of
 the
 market.
 But
 Goldman
 Sachs
 going


vertical,
 that's
 a
 problem.
 When
 it
 gets


to
 two
 and
 a
 half
 times
 book
 value,


people
 say,
 "Okay,
 maybe
 a
 little
 bit


too
 far,
 too
 fast."
 Did
 you
 dissect?


Okay,
 let's
 dissect
 this
 headline
 for
 a


second.
 Labor
 and
 material
 shortages
 are


are
 delaying
 some
 data
 centers
 from
 2027


to
 2028.
 That
 doesn't
 change
 anything


fundamentally,
 does
 it?


>> Uh,
 it
 doesn't
 change
 much


fundamentally.
 It
 does
 tell
 youight
 that


there's
 too
 much
 capital
 trying
 to
 cram


into
 a
 certain
 part
 of
 the
 economy.
 Uh,


and
 it's
 stressing
 some
 balance
 sheets


and
 it's
 stressing
 the
 resources
 of
 the


of
 the
 country.
 No,
 I
 don't
 think
 that


really
 changes
 the
 overall
 story.
 But


just
 the
 notion
 that
 Oracle
 is
 straining


to
 get
 this
 stuff
 done
 um
 at
 a
 time
 when


people
 are
 just
 sort
 of
 kind
 of
 asking


themselves
 can
 open
 AAI
 make
 good
 on
 the


commitments
 that
 it's
 that
 it's


basically
 put
 out
 there.
 Again,
 it


doesn't
 change
 the
 whole
 story
 NASDAQ


still
 up
 big
 for
 the
 year.
 You
 know,


it's
 not
 really
 unwinding
 the
 entire


thesis.
 What
 I
 do
 think
 is
 with
 a
 market


that
 has
 really
 been
 actively
 in
 this


high
 torque
 rotation,
 you're
 getting
 a


little
 bit
 of
 a


>> core
 weave
 is
 is
 uh
 illustrative
 of
 this


dynamic
 down
 8%.
 Also,
 we've
 moved
 past


every
 earnings
 catalyst
 for
 the
 rest
 of


the
 year.
 Sure.
 Uh
 so
 it's
 kind
 of
 hard


not
 to
 envision
 some
 people
 just
 saying


this.
 Although
 nor
 although
 you're


always
 past
 every
 earnings
 catalyst
 at


this
 point
 in
 the
 year
 and
 yet
 we
 often


get
 an
 upward
 drift
 of
 life.
 No
 news
 is


good
 news
 because
 you
 know
 we
 don't
 own


it
 enough.
 We
 don't
 have
 enough
 exposure


to
 it
 and
 that
 could
 start
 Monday.
 I


mean
 we
 really
 don't
 know.
 Uh
 but
 I
 do


think
 that
 we
 have
 to
 recognize
 I
 think


people
 are
 recognizing
 that
 we
 are


beyond
 the
 point
 of
 innocent
 wonder


about
 AI.
 It's
 always
 going
 to
 come
 with


but
 can
 we
 afford
 it?
 But
 are
 they
 going


to
 be
 financing
 it
 correctly?
 But
 can


all
 the
 winners
 actually
 get


>> prove
 them?
 All
 of
 it.
 And


>> does
 that
 mean
 we're
 not
 in
 a
 bubble?


>> No.
 I
 I
 think
 I
 don't
 think
 we've
 been


in
 a
 bubble
 in
 the
 sense
 that
 it's
 it's


going
 to
 come
 crashing
 down.
 My


definition
 of
 a
 bubble
 is
 asset
 prices


are
 at
 a
 level
 where
 you
 can
 pretty


easily
 contemplate
 75%
 declines.
 Like


honestly,
 just
 massive
 decadel
 long


impairment
 of
 capital
 is
 on
 the
 way.


I've
 never
 thought
 we
 got
 there,
 okay,


in
 the
 overall
 market,
 even
 in
 the
 tech


sector.
 But
 short
 of
 a
 bubble,
 you
 get


to
 a
 place
 where
 the
 riskreward
 is


pretty
 dicey
 and
 maybe
 it's
 not
 going
 to


be
 that
 rewarding
 and
 maybe
 the
 the


losers
 start
 to
 uh
 seem
 more
 scary
 than


the
 winners
 seem
 enticing.
 And
 that's


so
 that
 is
 the
 headline
 here
 that


continues
 to
 be
 the
 argument
 on
 the
 day


for
 this
 pain.
 It's
 getting
 worse
 too.


Amazon
 low
 of
 day.
 Nvidia
 low
 of
 day.


Broadcom
 not
 low
 of
 day
 but
 pretty


close.
 S&P
 very
 close
 to
 losing
 680
 but


has
 not
 lost


680
 yet.
 I
 mean
 look
 the
 point
 he's


making
 is
 yeah
 this
 Oracle
 opening
 I


news
 doesn't
 negate
 the
 nature
 of
 AI


data
 centers
 bull
 market
 etc.
 But
 the


street
 is
 the
 street
 and
 they're
 going


to
 hear
 something
 like
 this
 which


doesn't
 fundamentally
 change
 anything


and
 there's
 already
 a
 lot
 of
 fears


around
 open
 AI


and
 as
 a
 result
 you
 know
 they're
 going


to
 react
 aggressively
 which
 is
 what


we're
 seeing.
 We
 do
 have
 some
 news
 on


Elon
 Musk's
 XAI
 uh
 or
 sorry
 X
 this
 is


Twitter
 revenue
 is
 2
 billion
 in
 the


first
 nine
 months
 of
 2025.
 Revenue


increased
 18%
 year
 to
 date
 from
 prior


year.
 They
 lost
 577
 million
 in
 the
 last


quarter
 and
 their
 EBID
 is
 up
 16%.


So
 you
 got
 X
 which
 is
 bullish


uh
 and
 seeing
 some
 revenue
 growth.
 Now
 I


would
 love
 to
 see
 XAI's
 numbers
 because


it'd
 be
 exciting
 to
 see
 how
 many
 people


actually
 pay
 for
 Grock.
 Granted,
 XAI


owns
 X,
 so
 I
 guess,
 you
 know,
 there's


correlation
 there.
 But


yeah,
 any
 of
 those
 headlines
 are
 not


going
 to
 stop
 how
 the
 market's
 reacting


to
 Oracle
 and
 opening
 eye.
 Oracle
 now


187.
 There
 she
 goes.
 S&P
 below
 670.


Below
 670.


There
 she
 is.
 We
 are
 now


meaningfully


seeing
 some
 red
 on
 the
 day.
 Nvidia
 175,


Bit
 Mine
 6%
 down.
 Bitcoin
 and
 Ethereum


look
 like
 they
 just
 want
 to
 fall
 off.


Palunteer
 178
 that
 got
 hit.
 Hoodie


unfortunately
 getting
 hit
 as
 well.
 Tesla


was
 at
 460
 today.
 That's
 hit.
 App
 loving


that's
 hit.
 See,
 okay.
 So,
 when
 when


we're
 seeing
 this
 type
 of
 destruction


across
 the
 day,
 we
 all
 know
 ALOS
 are


obviously
 taking
 place
 and
 you
 know,
 a


lot
 of these
 stocks
 are
 it
 feels
 like


the
 bottom's
 falling
 out.


question
 is,
 does
 the
 falling
 knife
 stop


falling
 today,
 Monday,
 Tuesday?
 Does
 it


reverse
 in
 another
 couple
 minutes?
 Does


it,
 you
 know,
 continue
 to
 keep
 falling


throughout
 next
 week
 until
 we
 get
 some


more
 clarity
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the


year?
 I
 mean,
 like
 these
 these
 are
 the


questions
 that
 start
 to
 get
 asked
 when


it
 becomes
 obvious
 that
 everything's


going
 down
 for
 the
 hell
 of
 going
 down.


Where's
 I
 rent?
 Is
 that
 still
 holding


40?
 No,
 I
 ran
 17
 cents
 away
 from
 losing


40.


And
 Nebby
 has
 already
 lost
 90.
 That's


down
 7%.


This
 is
 way
 oversold.
 Yeah,
 it
 feels


like
 it.
 Did
 we
 get
 back
 into
 fear?


Let's
 see.


Yeah,
 back
 into
 fear.


Get
 back
 into
 fear


as
 you
 see


the
 pain
 here.
 40
 on
 fear
 and
 greed


as
 that
 one's
 red.


Um


Nvidia's
 about
 500
 billion
 not
 including


open
 ice
 will
 be
 huge
 in
 yeah
 again
 look


a
 lot
 of
 the
 bullish
 things
 around
 the


broader
 AI
 trade
 including
 Nvidia
 AMD


the
 neoclouds
 none
 of
 that
 changes
 with


an
 opening
 eye
 oracle
 headline.
 It's
 I


just
 think
 it's
 exhausting
 for
 everybody


which
 look
 fair.


It's
 exhausting
 but
 nonetheless
 these


are
 the
 headlines
 that
 the
 market
 for


forget
 in
 2025
 I
 mean
 going
 over
 the


next
 four
 or
 five
 years
 these
 are


headlines
 that
 can
 immediately
 get
 you


up
 10%
 in
 on
 an
 individual
 stock
 and
 can


get
 you
 down
 10%.


If
 the
 market's
 not
 happy
 with
 how


they're
 interpreting
 it.


Is
 it
 a
 thesis
 breaker
 is
 the
 question.


No.
 Like
 if
 there
 wasn't
 a
 thesis


breaker
 in
 freaking
 November
 when
 you


had
 things
 that
 were
 much
 worse
 than


this
 in
 terms
 of
 the
 narrative,
 then
 I


don't
 think


an
 opening
 eye
 delay
 necessarily


is
 what
 caused
 this.
 But
 it's
 annoying.


It's
 obviously
 very
 annoying.


Yeah,
 Oracle
 not
 really
 finding
 a
 bid


right
 here.


Oracle
 not
 finding
 a
 bid
 as
 that
 one


continues
 to
 get
 hit.


Um


where's
 Broadcom


361?


So
 Broadcom
 down
 11.
 It
 did
 it
 has
 not


violated
 below
 359.


Coreweave
 though
 again
 coreweave
 way


more
 exposed
 to
 OpenAI


than
 the
 other
 Neo
 clouds.
 A
 lot
 of
 the


leasing
 they're
 doing
 is
 to
 OpenAI.
 But


if
 OpenAI
 doesn't
 have
 the
 data
 centers


to
 put
 the
 GPUs
 in,
 then
 obviously


Corore's
 not
 going
 to
 get
 paid.
 So


immediately


the
 reaction
 goes
 to
 Cororeweave.


Julie
 says,
 "I
 got
 to
 buy
 my
 Broadcom


covered
 calls
 back."
 Yeah,
 this
 is
 your


this
 is
 your
 bright
 side
 with
 the


covered
 calls.


We
 get
 uh


you
 get
 a
 little
 reprieve
 and
 get
 I
 mean


this
 is
 what
 I
 did
 with
 Nvidia
 last


week.
 Just
 bought
 back
 all
 those
 covered


calls.


This
 has
 nothing
 to
 do
 with
 OpenAI.


Well,
 the
 headline
 is
 OpenAI
 delays
 data


center
 buildout
 with
 Oracle.
 So,


intrinsically,


you
 know,
 the
 market
 is
 scared.
 Oracle,


the
 market's
 scared.
 Oracle
 doesn't
 have


the
 demand.
 The
 market's
 basically


saying,
 Oracle,
 you're
 you're
 you're


lying
 to
 us.
 You're
 telling
 us
 Open
 AI


is
 going
 to
 give
 you
 all
 this
 money,
 but


A,
 we
 don't
 believe
 that
 OpenAI
 has
 the


money.
 B,
 now
 you're
 delaying
 the
 money


from
 coming
 to
 you,
 which
 makes
 us
 feel


like
 you're
 not
 actually
 going
 to
 get


the
 money.
 And
 Oracle's
 like,
 okay,


whatever.
 You
 can
 think
 what
 you
 want,


but
 we're
 raising
 a
 lot
 of
 debt
 because


we
 know
 that
 to
 build
 all
 this
 stuff


out,
 we're
 going
 to
 need
 the
 money.
 And


the
 reason
 we're
 going to
 need
 the
 money


is
 because
 we
 have
 a
 $300
 billion


customer
 on
 the
 sidelines.
 And
 the


market's
 like,
 well,
 wait
 a
 second.
 If


you're
 so
 confident,
 why
 is
 this


customer
 delaying
 the
 data
 center
 stuff


that
 you
 raised
 all
 this
 debt
 for?
 And


then
 Oracle's
 like,
 because
 of
 labor
 and


material
 shortages.


And


the
 market's
 final
 response
 on
 that


conversation
 is
 we
 don't
 believe
 it's


about
 labor
 and
 material
 shortages.
 And


I
 think
 that's
 why
 the
 market's
 red.


Now,
 the
 optimistic
 perspective
 is
 it


probably
 is
 about
 logistics,
 labor,
 yada


yada.
 It's
 not
 really
 about
 demand,
 but


you
 have
 to
 believe
 in
 the
 optimistic


side
 versus
 the
 short-term
 pessimism


that
 the
 market's
 having
 here.


And
 I
 think
 that's
 at
 least
 trying
 to


explain
 how
 that
 headline
 is
 being


interpreted.


Rocket
 Lab.
 Yeah.
 Is
 this
 one
 holding
 60


61?


When
 things
 go
 bearish,
 everything


falls.
 Rocket
 Lab
 right
 here
 from
 65
 to


61


right
 here.
 ESTs
 also.
 Yeah,
 this
 one


got
 a
 big
 move
 yesterday.
 But
 I
 mean,


if
 the
 entire
 space
 sector
 is
 going
 to


get
 hit,


then
 this
 one's
 going
 to
 get
 hit
 as


well.


When
 you
 had
 the
 scarf
 on,
 everything


was
 green.
 Yeah,
 but
 you
 guys
 said
 I


looked
 goofy
 with
 the
 scarf.
 So,
 I
 mean,


want
 a
 green
 market
 or
 do
 we
 want
 me
 to


look
 less
 goofy?
 I
 mean,


have
 to
 sacrifice
 the
 goofiness
 to
 uh


to
 to
 save
 our
 our
 portfolio.
 Speaking


of
 goofy,
 let's
 get
 some
 analysis
 here


on
 this
 Disney
 opening
 ideal


>> in
 Hollywood
 and
 its
 importance
 to
 this


ecosystem.
 So,
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think
 it's


a
 smart
 move.
 Uh
 I
 don't
 again
 don't


know
 the
 details,
 but
 it
 seems
 like
 a


good
 thing
 to
 have
 done.


>> Yeah.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 go


down
 in
 Hollywood?
 I
 did
 notice
 that
 the


the
 unions
 weren't
 all
 that
 impressed


with
 it.
 Um
 the
 Writer
 Guild
 of
 America,


which
 was
 of
 course
 on
 strike
 uh
 over


some
 of
 these
 issues
 like
 AI,
 said
 in


part,
 "It
 appears
 to
 sanction
 the
 theft


of
 our
 work
 and
 seeds
 the
 value
 of
 what


we
 create
 to
 a
 tech
 company
 that
 has


built
 its
 business
 off
 our
 backs."


>> Well,
 you
 know,
 Hollywood
 has
 said
 this


in
 the
 past
 when
 new
 technologies
 come.


There
 was
 a
 problem
 when
 when
 VHS
 tapes


were
 were
 coming
 into
 being
 and
 that
 was


going
 to
 destroy
 theatrical
 viewing.


Then
 the
 DVDs
 and
 and
 and
 streaming.


It's
 always
 there's
 always
 some


nervousness
 and
 and
 rightfully
 so.
 I


think
 that
 AI
 is
 a
 big
 paradigm
 shift
 in


a
 way
 that
 some
 of
 these
 other


technologies
 maybe
 weren't.
 But
 if
 it
 if


done
 the
 right
 way,
 and
 I'm
 sure
 Disney


is
 stewarding
 this
 exactly
 correctly,
 it


can
 actually
 be
 these
 deals
 can
 be
 done


in
 a
 way
 that
 protects
 the
 IP,
 protects


the
 creative
 forces
 behind
 the
 stories,


and
 actually
 adds
 to
 the
 ability
 to


engage
 audiences
 and
 to
 monetize
 those


stories
 and
 and
 and
 that
 capability.
 So,


it
 has
 to
 be
 done
 the
 right
 way
 and
 I
 do


think
 you
 Disney
 will
 will
 have
 done
 the


exact
 right
 thing
 in
 that
 deal
 with


OpenAI.
 So,
 I
 I
 hope
 that
 this
 is
 a
 a


good
 barometer
 um
 for
 how
 things
 should


be
 done
 in
 the
 future.


>> All right.
 So,
 you
 got
 some
 analysts


going
 more
 bullish
 than
 not
 on
 uh
 the


Disney
 partnership.
 OCC
 grants


conditional
 approval
 to
 Ripple,
 Bitco


Fidelity
 Digital
 Assets,
 and
 Paxo
 to


become
 national
 trust
 banks.


Wow,
 that
 seems
 relatively
 bullish
 for


the
 crypto
 space


uh
 and
 for
 the
 overall
 digital
 asset


ecosystem.
 Bitcoin
 right
 there
 getting
 a


bounce
 896
 to
 90.4.
 It's
 almost
 a


thousand
 bucks.


So
 that
 is
 a
 relatively


decent
 headline
 here.


But
 that
 is
 green.
 By
 the
 way,
 for


everyone
 said
 the
 that
 the
 beard
 was


bearish,
 we
 hit
 all-time
 highs
 over
 the


past
 week
 with
 the
 beard
 really
 over
 the


past
 two
 weeks.
 So
 shaving
 the
 beard,
 I


don't
 think
 really
 changes
 anything.
 the


beard.
 I
 mean,
 we
 got
 the
 most
 dovish


fed
 ever
 and
 you
 guys
 were
 watching
 a


guy
 with
 a
 beard
 stare
 at
 JPAL.


I
 don't
 think
 it's
 the
 beard.
 I
 think


it's
 stupid
 Open
 AI


and
 their
 ridiculous
 spending


commitments
 that
 the
 street
 doesn't


believe
 in
 that's
 causing
 all
 this
 [ __ ]


Like,
 I
 wonder
 if
 Open
 AI
 just
 didn't


say
 we're
 going
 to
 spend
 1.4
 trillion.


What
 if
 they
 said
 we're
 going
 to
 spend
 a


hundred
 billion
 over
 the
 next
 couple


years?
 Like
 like
 yeah,
 maybe
 some
 of


these
 stocks
 would
 have
 be
 trading
 at


aggressive
 multiples,
 but
 then
 again,


maybe
 open
 Oracle
 didn't
 deserve
 to
 go


to
 350.
 And
 so
 if
 Oracle
 had
 stayed
 flat


over
 the
 past
 couple
 months
 because
 they


didn't
 have
 this
 massive
 RPO
 growth,


that
 wouldn't
 have
 broken
 the
 AI
 thesis,


but
 it
 also
 wouldn't
 have
 put
 some
 like


ridiculous
 unrealistic
 expectation
 that


the
 market
 is
 now
 skeptical
 of
 OpenAI


living
 up
 to.
 Maybe
 it
 would
 have
 been


netne
 good
 versus


versus
 bad


because
 you
 also
 XAI
 doesn't
 have
 these


crazy
 numbers.
 Anthropic
 doesn't
 have


these
 crazy
 numbers.
 Like
 OpenAI
 is
 the


only
 company
 that's
 legit
 saying,
 "Yeah,


we're
 going
 to
 spend
 trillions
 of


dollars
 to
 build
 out
 data
 centers
 and


we're
 doing,
 you
 know,
 20
 billion
 in


revenue."


So


it's
 it
 becomes
 hard
 to
 believe
 at
 some


point.
 And
 again,
 the
 stock
 that
 I
 think


this
 affect
 or
 this
 could
 affect
 the


most,
 which
 I
 hate
 because
 I
 know
 so


many
 people
 love
 this
 one,
 is
 AMD.


This
 thing
 pumped
 on
 the
 OpenAI
 news.


Now,
 the
 good
 thing
 about
 this
 one
 is


that
 OpenAI
 needs
 the
 chips.
 Like,
 that


is
 like,
 you
 know,
 AMD
 is
 not
 selling


them
 something
 that
 is
 relatively


commoditized.
 Like,
 they
 need
 the
 chips.


So,
 you
 would
 imagine
 they're
 good
 for


the
 money
 on
 this
 one,


but
 they've
 got
 to
 come
 through.
 And
 if


they
 don't,
 I
 think
 AMD
 gets
 hit
 pretty


bad,
 just
 like
 Oracle.


So
 that
 that
 one
 is
 the
 one
 I
 think
 we


all
 really
 have
 to
 monitor
 when
 it
 comes


to
 that
 partnership.


Sam
 won't
 go
 down
 long.
 Well,
 this
 was


what
 we
 were
 talking
 about
 a
 month
 ago.


Remember
 when
 the
 Wall
 Street
 Journal


did
 that
 article
 that
 that
 said
 open
 too


big
 to
 fail?
 I
 think
 they
 were
 dead
 on


about
 I
 think
 Sam
 is
 realizing
 that
 if


he's
 going
 to
 lose
 in
 this
 race,
 he's


not
 going
 down
 by
 himself
 and
 he's


trying
 to
 make
 sure
 he's
 intertwined


with
 every
 single
 big
 company
 to
 make


sure
 they're
 incentivized
 to


to
 keep
 him
 afloat.


Q's
 losing
 the
 50-day.


We
 got
 a
 little
 move
 off
 611,
 but
 yes,


we
 are
 close
 to
 that
 level
 61284


as
 well.


Um,
 Kwami,
 thank
 you
 for the
 super
 chat.


Admit
 in
 the
 midst
 of
 all
 this
 pain,
 I


must
 say
 that
 the
 hat
 is
 fire.
 I


actually
 got
 this
 hat
 from
 Andre
 and


Horowitz
 when
 I
 was
 at
 their
 event.


It's
 like
 their
 American
 Dynamism
 logo.


I
 just
 wore
 this
 today
 with
 the
 scarf.
 I


I
 didn't
 really
 think
 twice
 about
 it,


but
 now
 you
 guys
 are
 blaming
 the
 hat.


Bro,
 we
 want
 to
 blame
 everyone
 except


Sam
 Alman.
 Everyone
 except
 OpenAI
 is


getting
 a
 pass
 today.


My
 hat,
 my
 beard,
 my
 scarf.


Not
 the
 guy
 who
 said
 he's
 going
 to
 spend


1.4
 trillion.


It's
 the
 freaking
 scarf.
 Ben,
 thank
 you


for
 the
 $50
 super
 chat.
 Appreciate
 you


for
 being
 here.


Thank
 you
 for
 the
 super
 chat
 as
 well.


Yeah,
 I
 can't
 even
 drink
 Saratoga
 now.


Like,
 I
 feel
 guilty
 if
 I
 I
 literally


have
 not
 drink
 Saratoga
 since
 you
 guys


called
 me
 out
 on
 it
 because
 I
 feel


guilty


if
 I
 drink
 it
 and
 the
 market
 goes
 down.


Like
 I
 literally
 can't
 drink
 that
 brand


of
 water.
 And
 the
 bottles
 look
 so
 cool.


Like


I
 want
 to
 buy
 those
 bottles
 again
 and


look
 cool
 drinking
 it,
 but
 I
 can't


because
 I
 know
 I'm
 going to
 get
 [ __ ]


Broadcom
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move.
 363
 from


359,


but
 that's
 up.


Just
 let
 us
 know
 beforehand.


Let
 us
 know
 before
 you
 drink.


Oh
 boy.
 If
 meta
 drops
 on
 high


expenditures,
 then
 should
 then
 should


every
 company
 out
 there
 drop?
 But
 it


seems
 to
 be
 an
 overreaction.
 Yeah.
 The


only
 difference
 is
 Google,
 Microsoft,


and
 Amazon
 are
 showing
 a
 clear
 ROI
 on


the
 capex.
 Meta
 is
 not.


So
 the
 street's
 not
 really
 bearish


capex.
 They're
 bearish
 capex
 that


doesn't
 have
 an
 associated
 narrative


with
 it
 that
 is
 easy
 to
 understand.
 And


Google,
 Microsoft,
 Amazon
 have
 something


very
 simple
 to
 understand
 with
 the


capex,
 which
 is
 the
 cloud.
 Meta
 does


not.


Still,
 Meta
 doesn't
 deserve
 to
 be


trading
 at
 18
 times
 earnings.
 But
 wow,


Meta
 below
 640
 right
 there.


But
 still,
 that
 narrative
 would
 create


the
 pain.
 Core
 weave
 down
 11.


Core
 weave
 down
 11.


Isn't
 it
 so
 crazy
 how
 money
 can


evaporate?


I'm
 down
 82
 now
 on
 the
 day.
 It
 was
 down


32.
 Now
 we're
 down
 82.


Literally
 evaporates,
 bro.
 It's
 there,


then
 it's
 gone.


It's
 there
 and
 then
 it
 goes
 away.


Kind
 of
 feels
 it's
 it
 feels
 like
 such
 a


rug
 pull,
 too,
 because
 we
 got
 such
 a


great
 JPAL,
 such
 a
 great
 rate
 cut
 FOMC


uh
 decision.


We
 got
 alltime
 highs
 yesterday,
 even


with
 Broadcom
 not
 having
 the
 best


earnings.
 And
 then
 boom,
 Friday
 take


away
 all
 of
 it.


All
 of
 it.


Which
 actually,
 I
 think,
 sets
 up
 a


pretty
 good
 run
 into.
 I
 mean,
 look,
 it


going
 into
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year
 down
 and


then
 recovering
 and
 then
 hitting
 slight


all-time
 highs
 is
 way
 easier
 than
 just


like
 naturally
 inching
 higher
 and
 higher


and
 higher,
 which
 we
 did
 for
 six
 months,


which
 has
 never
 really
 been
 seen
 before.


for
 six
 months
 in
 a
 row
 of
 not
 even
 a


single
 1%
 move
 on
 the
 S&P
 is
 kind
 of


crazy.


But
 maybe
 to
 get
 that
 last
 end
 of
 year


run,
 we
 need
 to
 get
 hit
 a
 little
 bit


before
 we
 close
 out.


It's
 just
 nothing
 we've
 seen
 in
 the


macro
 data
 all
 week
 in
 jobless
 claims,


nothing
 in
 the
 inflation
 report,
 nothing


with
 the
 Fed,
 nothing
 macro
 seemed
 like


uber
 bearish
 to
 discuss.
 Labor
 market
 is


still
 a
 concern,
 but
 the
 labor
 market


has
 the
 concerns
 have
 been
 listened
 to


as
 per
 the
 rate
 cut.
 doesn't
 mean
 the


labor
 market's
 perfect,
 but
 it
 means
 at


least
 the
 Fed
 is
 doing
 the
 one
 thing


they
 can
 do
 to
 try
 to
 stop
 the
 labor


market
 from
 getting
 killed.


And
 so
 then
 you
 ask
 yourself,
 well
 then


what's
 the
 reason
 for
 the
 red?
 Well,


it's
 this
 Oracle
 AI
 news.
 Well,
 it
 then


begs
 the
 question,
 is
 this
 big
 enough
 to


really
 cause
 that
 much
 pain?


As
 of
 now,
 yes,
 but


maybe
 not
 in
 the
 uh


in
 the
 coming
 weeks
 if
 it
 reverses.
 Is


the
 tenure
 still
 up?
 Tenure
 is


still
 up.
 4.19.


We
 got
 Tom
 Lee
 on
 the
 Prof
 G
 podcast.
 So


remember
 you
 had
 Oswath,
 the
 NYU


professor,
 dean
 of evaluations
 went
 on


two
 weeks
 ago.
 I
 think
 he
 really
 scared


a
 lot
 of
 people
 about
 the
 state
 of
 the


markets.
 You
 got
 Tom
 Lee
 making
 his


appearance.
 Let's
 listen
 to
 a
 little
 bit


of
 this.
 Here's
 his
 take
 for


being
 bullish
 2026.


All


right,
 let's
 bust
 right
 into
 it.
 You've


been
 suppressed
 for
 the
 past
 few
 years.


Part
 of
 it
 is
 of
 course
 that
 we've
 seen


six
 what
 I
 call
 extinction
 events
 take


place
 in
 markets.
 Everything
 from
 CO
 to


the
 bullet
 supply
 chain
 effect
 as
 the


economy
 restarted
 to
 that
 the
 fastest


inflation
 cycle
 in
 history
 and
 then


followed
 by
 the
 fastest
 Fed
 hikes
 in


history.
 And
 then
 we've
 of
 course
 had
 a


very
 controversial
 administration
 which


which
 put
 tariffs
 in
 place
 in
 April
 of


this
 year
 that
 caused
 a
 miniature
 bare


market.
 And
 then
 we've
 even
 had
 US


bombing
 Iran's
 nuclear
 facilities.
 I


think
 all
 of
 these
 collectively
 had
 made


have
 made
 investors
 very
 nervous
 about


uh
 what
 I
 call
 investing
 in
 full
 risk


because
 these
 are
 what
 six
 black
 swans


that
 happened
 in
 four
 years.
 And
 I
 think


on
 top
 of
 that,
 we've
 had
 a
 a
 Fed
 that's


had
 has
 not
 really
 given
 a
 green
 light


about
 monetary
 easing.
 And
 I
 think
 the


Fed's
 reluctance
 has
 actually
 suppressed


business
 quote
 animal
 spirits
 because


the
 ISM
 has
 been
 below
 50
 for
 for
 more


than
 3
 years
 now.
 So
 I
 think
 that's
 all


been
 a
 business
 cycle
 that
 has
 been


pretty
 good,
 but
 not
 one
 that
 has
 been


really
 expansionary.
 And
 I
 think
 that


starts
 to
 happen
 next
 year.
 It
 feels
 as


if
 the
 market
 has
 become
 so
 concentrated


or
 dependent
 or
 circling
 around
 a
 small


number
 of
 stocks
 that
 to
 be
 bullish
 on


26
 sort
 of
 mandates
 that
 you're
 well


tell
 me
 if
 you
 think
 this
 is
 true


indicates
 that
 you're
 bullish
 on
 the


magnificent
 10
 and
 AI
 stocks.
 Is
 that


necessarily
 true?
 And
 are
 you
 bullish
 on


the
 magnificent
 10?


>> Yeah,
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 2026
 is
 going
 to


look
 a
 lot
 like
 this
 year.
 U
 we
 are


probably
 going
 to
 have
 many
 months
 where


the
 market
 is
 uh
 actually
 down
 year
 to


date.
 You
 know
 I
 mean
 this
 year
 we
 were


down
 double
 digits
 at
 one
 point
 before


the
 market
 recovered.
 I
 think
 that
 plays


out
 next
 year.
 But
 for
 the
 reason
 I
 I


previously
 stated,
 I
 I
 think
 that
 we
 end


up
 a a
 bullish
 outcome
 despite
 all
 the


skepticism
 and
 it
 does
 require
 large
 cap


tech
 and
 AI
 stocks
 to
 still
 produce


earnings
 growth
 and
 not
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 PE


reduction
 so
 that
 you
 still
 get
 positive


return.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 the
 rest
 of
 the


stock
 market,
 sort
 of
 the
 other
 490
 or


so,
 can
 actually
 perform
 well
 because
 if


the
 Fed
 is
 cutting
 and
 interest
 rates


are
 coming
 down
 and
 the
 business
 cycle


is
 sort
 of
 really
 starting,
 that
 that's


good
 for
 other
 stocks.
 As
 you
 say,
 we've


seen
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 black
 swan
 events,


things
 that
 you
 would
 think
 would
 freak


the
 markets
 out
 and
 make
 people
 worried.


And
 yet,
 I
 look
 at
 what
 has
 happened
 in


the
 markets,
 and
 my
 view
 of
 it
 is
 it's


not
 necessarily
 that
 it's
 uh
 suppressing


sentiment.
 To
 me,
 it
 almost
 looks
 like


the
 market
 is
 deciding
 to
 shrug


everything
 off.
 So,
 when
 you
 describe


how,
 you
 know,
 perhaps
 these
 black
 swan


events
 have
 made
 investors
 perhaps
 have


less
 lower
 risk
 appetite,
 to
 me,
 I'm


almost
 kind
 of
 taking
 the
 other
 side
 of


that
 in
 my
 head.
 I'm
 like,
 it
 seems
 as


if
 these
 things
 happen,
 these
 things


that
 are
 concerning.
 One
 example
 would


be
 what
 we're
 seeing
 with
 these
 AI


circular
 deals.
 And
 it
 seems
 to
 me
 that


the
 market
 is
 kind
 of
 swatting
 it
 away,


shrugging
 it
 off,
 and
 and
 the
 market


continues
 to
 climb.
 And
 that's
 what


we've
 seen
 this
 year,
 and
 we
 saw
 the


previous
 year,
 and
 we
 saw
 the
 year


before
 that.
 we
 continue
 to
 have
 this


bull
 market
 despite
 what
 many
 would
 say


are
 are
 really
 uh
 concerning
 events.
 So


how
 would
 you
 think
 about
 that?
 How


would
 you
 respond
 to
 my
 concerns
 there?


>> You're
 almost
 kind
 of
 mirroring
 what


we're
 observing,
 but
 just
 with
 a


different
 take.
 I
 mean
 our
 take
 is


markets
 climb
 a
 wall
 of
 worry.
 You
 know


historically
 uh
 when
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


skepticism


um
 stocks
 can
 rise.
 In
 fact
 you
 know


markets
 actually
 peak
 on
 good
 news.
 You


know
 they
 don't
 peak
 when
 people
 are


bearish.
 Markets
 peak
 when
 everyone's


bullish
 and
 it
 no
 longer
 responds
 to


good
 news
 just
 like
 markets
 bottom
 on


bad
 news.
 And
 uh
 I
 I
 think
 many
 people


are
 skeptical
 but
 stocks
 have
 risen.
 It


doesn't
 really
 mean
 markets
 are


shrugging
 off
 the
 concerns.
 That's
 one


way
 to
 interpret
 it.
 My
 other


interpretation
 is
 you
 know
 it
 there
 is
 a


wall
 of
 skepticism.
 And
 I
 mean
 maybe


that's
 just
 a
 it
 is
 like
 maybe
 we're


just
 talking
 about
 the
 same
 sides
 just


of
 of
 the
 same
 thing.
 And


>> all right,
 we'll
 get
 back
 to
 that.
 But


yeah,
 it's
 still
 pretty
 ugly,
 folks.


Nvidia
 low
 of
 day
 175.


Amcore
 down
 five.
 Adobe


up
 two.
 Spy
 low
 of
 day
 1.3.


It's
 not
 just
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 of
 a


decline
 here.
 It's
 full-on
 1.3.
 That


goes
 down
 a
 little
 bit
 more.
 You
 got
 a


2%
 day
 on
 the
 S&P,
 which
 obviously
 is


going
 to
 lead
 to
 a,
 you
 know,
 5
 to
 10%


move
 on
 everything
 else.
 Meta
 still


holding
 2%
 down
 and
 then
 Coreweave
 down


10.
 Where
 is
 Broadcom?
 Broadcom's
 still


holding
 360
 which
 is
 surprising.
 That's


at
 least
 not
 losing
 359.
 And
 then


Rocklab


holding
 60.


Admit
 if
 you
 put
 on
 the
 scarf
 it
 stops


bleeding.


Okay.
 Well,
 what
 a
 what
 happens
 if
 I
 put


on
 the
 scarf
 and
 then
 it
 keeps
 bleeding?


Like


I
 don't
 know
 if
 the
 scarf's
 going
 to
 fix


this.
 Wow.
 Bitcoin
 896.


There's
 your
 bigger
 move
 right
 there


on
 Bitcoin.


Uh,


throw
 out
 the
 scarf.
 Then
 you
 try
 two


scarves.


Oh
 my
 gosh.


Nabi
 is
 7.4%
 down.
 Broadcom
 down
 10.


Rocket
 Lab
 down
 five.


See,
 it
 looks
 like
 the
 bottom's
 falling


out,
 but
 this
 is
 usually
 when
 the
 bottom


stops
 falling
 out.
 But
 an
 OpenAI
 Oracle


headline
 to
 cause
 all
 of
 this,
 I
 mean,


my
 goodness,
 feels
 more
 like
 Friday


wonky
 behavior
 that's
 being
 amplified


versus
 legitimately
 this
 is
 the
 bare


case.
 A
 data
 center
 is
 delayed
 by
 a


year.
 Oracle
 basically
 low
 of
 days
 right


here
 at
 187.


Um,


yes,
 that's
 the
 headline
 for
 those
 that


missed
 it.
 Oracle
 OpenAI
 delayed
 data


center
 for
 Oracle


is
 at
 least
 the
 perceptual
 reasons
 why


the
 market's
 getting
 hit.


It's
 got
 to
 be
 a
 shakeout.
 Yeah.
 I
 mean,


again,
 this
 happened
 last
 year.
 get


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 year,


you
 start
 getting
 a
 lot
 more.
 And
 here's


the
 thing
 again.
 When
 stuff
 like
 in


November,
 we
 talked
 about
 this,
 but
 when


things
 go
 red,
 if
 you're
 up
 on


something,
 there's
 two
 things.
 A,
 you're


on
 margin,
 you
 need
 to
 delever,
 so


you're
 going to
 sell
 whatever
 you're
 up


on,
 which
 means
 or
 even
 whatever
 you're


slightly
 down
 on,
 which
 just
 compounds


the
 selling.
 or
 B,
 um,


you
 want
 to
 lock
 in
 your
 gains
 for
 the


year
 because
 you're
 afraid
 that
 it
 gets


worse,


which
 could
 be
 classified
 as
 a
 panic


cell.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 these
 are
 the


levels
 like
 like
 if
 you
 sell
 your
 Met
 at


640,
 that's
 not
 panic
 cell
 to
 me.
 Now,


met
 at
 585
 3
 weeks
 ago,
 that
 feels
 more


like
 panic
 cell.
 So,
 I
 don't
 know if


we're
 at
 panic
 cell
 level
 yet,


but
 you
 know,
 hints
 of
 it
 could
 be


showing
 up,
 which
 could
 create
 a
 little


bit
 more
 pain.
 Sandis
 down
 15%.


13.76.


Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 names
 continue
 to


go
 down.
 Nothing
 to
 do
 with
 demand
 100%.


I
 mean,
 that's
 not
 the
 story.
 At least


that's
 not
 from
 the
 headlines
 that
 we're


hearing.
 It's
 not
 about
 band.


uh


seems
 to
 be
 more
 clearly
 about


the
 logistics
 and
 material
 shortages
 as


per
 Oracle's
 words
 around
 this


and
 that
 should
 potentially
 be
 causing


more
 of
 this
 pain
 but
 it
 is
 liquidating


the
 crap
 out
 of
 crypto
 unfortunately


and
 that
 is
 hurting
 that
 trade
 at least


for
 crypto.


Um,
 let's
 get
 an
 update
 on
 this
 Trump


executive
 order
 on
 weed.
 Now,
 the
 White


House
 again
 said
 that
 we're
 not


confirming
 anything,


but
 this
 one
 is
 there.
 You
 also
 have


some
 Epstein
 file
 headline.
 Apparently,


there's
 some
 new
 photos
 of
 Trump
 inside


of
 a
 bunch
 of
 uh
 files
 released
 by
 the


House
 Subcommittee.
 I
 don't
 know if


that's
 having
 that
 much
 of
 an
 impact,


but
 that
 is
 another
 headline


that
 you
 have
 this
 morning.


>> Like
 Tillray,
 Aurora,
 and
 the
 Advisor


Shares
 ETF
 are
 all
 soaring
 on
 these


reports
 that
 the
 president
 will
 move
 to


reclassify
 marijuana
 as
 a
 less
 dangerous


drug.
 Our
 Brandon
 Gomez
 has
 been


covering
 the
 story
 for
 what
 feels
 like


forever
 and
 has
 more
 on
 the
 timing
 of


this
 news.
 Hey,
 Brandon.


>> Hey,
 Carl.
 Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 I
 feel


like
 we've
 been
 here
 before,
 right?
 But


with
 the
 president
 wanting
 to
 reschedu


uh
 the
 drug
 to
 a
 new
 classification
 now


it
 is
 currently
 scheduled
 as
 schedule


one.
 Now
 that's
 on
 par
 with
 heroin
 down


to
 schedule
 three
 is
 what
 the
 president


wants
 to
 do
 the
 same
 as
 Tylenol
 with


codine.
 So
 why
 is
 this
 time
 different?


Well
 sources
 have
 told
 me
 that
 the


president
 is
 actively
 drafting
 an


executive
 order
 to
 be
 issued
 as
 soon
 as


Monday.
 Now
 it
 would
 advise
 the
 DOJ
 and


the
 DEA
 to
 move
 forward
 with


reclassification.
 The
 White
 House
 so
 far


saying
 no
 final
 decision
 has
 been
 made


yet.
 Now,
 I
 did
 speak
 this
 morning


though
 with
 Tillray
 CEO
 Irwin
 Simon,
 one


of
 the
 largest
 cannabis
 growers
 in
 the


industry.
 He
 believed
 this
 time
 is


different
 from
 past
 promises,
 telling
 me


after
 many
 false
 starts,
 he
 is
 quote


more
 optimistic
 this
 time
 around,
 adding


he
 believes
 there
 will
 be
 change
 by
 the


end
 of
 the
 year.
 Now,
 Carl,
 let's
 say
 we


do
 get
 the
 executive
 order
 on
 Monday,


what's
 next?
 Well,
 the
 DOJ
 and
 the
 DEA


will
 publish
 a
 final
 rule.
 It'll
 then


enter
 a
 30-day
 waiting
 period
 for
 any


challenges.
 We
 did
 just
 get
 a
 hemp
 ban


in
 the
 government
 spending
 bill.
 So,
 we


know
 opposition
 is
 out
 there.
 And
 then


any
 litigation
 would
 result
 in
 further


delay
 of
 the
 process.
 So,
 as
 it
 goes


with
 cannabis
 and
 as
 you
 mentioned
 off


the
 top,
 two
 steps
 forward
 possible,


four
 steps
 back.
 One
 cannabis
 lawyer


though
 telling
 me
 that
 this
 is
 the


beginning
 of
 a
 quote
 new
 era
 of
 public


health
 policy,
 but
 that
 this
 would
 be
 a


partial
 victory
 with
 legalization
 and


regulatory
 hurdles
 still
 ahead.
 Still


major
 implic.


>> All right.
 So
 that
 could
 be
 some
 of
 the


momentum
 on
 the
 the
 weed
 stocks
 that


continues
 to
 make
 it
 bullish.
 Micron


continuing
 to
 get
 hit
 as
 well.
 Uh
 for


people
 asking
 why
 why
 is
 Micron
 SMCI


getting
 hit
 all
 of
 them
 play
 a
 pivotal


role
 in
 the
 data
 center
 buildup
 whether


it's
 the
 server
 racks
 or
 the
 memory
 for


the
 GPUs.
 I
 mean
 they're
 all
 part
 of


this
 and


OpenAI
 delaying
 a
 data
 center
 is
 not


intrinsically
 bearish.
 it
 perceptually
 I


mean
 and
 that's
 the
 difference
 right


like
 there's
 a
 difference
 between


intrinsic
 bearish
 and
 perceptual
 bearish


bearishness


intrinsic
 bearishness
 means
 like
 a


thesis
 is
 broken
 aka
 Oracle
 saying
 we


don't
 have
 enough
 demand
 to
 just
 or
 open


AI
 doesn't
 have
 enough
 demand
 to
 justify


paying
 us
 300
 billion
 perceptual


bearishness
 is
 we
 are
 delaying
 the
 data


center
 everything's
 fine
 but
 we
 need
 a


year
 of
 delays
 and
 then
 the
 market's


like
 well
 no
 we
 think
 that's
 bearish
 or


the
 perception
 that
 is
 bearish


It's
 not
 a
 thesis
 breaker,
 but


nonetheless,
 it'll
 it'll
 crack
 some
 of


these
 stocks.
 And
 that's
 why
 I
 think


Micron
 right
 here
 down
 6.3


as
 that's
 hit
 Nebius
 right
 here
 88.
 A


little
 move
 off
 86,
 but
 that
 one's
 still


still
 down.
 If
 OpenAI
 can't
 pay,
 someone


else
 will.
 So,
 that
 that
 is
 a
 good


point.
 And
 Oracle
 did
 make
 a
 point
 of


that
 on
 their
 earnings
 call
 that
 there


plenty
 of
 demand
 outside
 of
 OpenAI.
 But


again,
 it
 comes
 down
 to
 if
 if
 the


market's
 not
 going
 to
 give
 Nvidia
 30


times
 forward
 earnings,
 they're


definitely
 not
 going
 to
 believe
 that


there's
 some
 customer
 out
 there
 that's


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 pay
 money
 if
 OpenI


can't
 pay,
 which
 probably
 is
 the
 wrong


take.
 But
 nonetheless,
 that's


that's
 the
 perception


and
 that's
 why
 I
 think
 we
 get
 some
 of


the
 pain
 right
 here.


Um
 Pam,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.


Probably
 buying
 SoFi,
 never
 owned
 it.


Yeah,
 look,
 I
 like
 it
 here.
 Uh,
 the


problem
 is
 again,
 if
 everything
 goes


red,
 then
 everything
 goes
 red.
 So,
 if
 we


get
 a
 bounce,
 SoFi
 probably
 easily


bounces
 up
 back
 to
 that
 275th
 level.
 But


2026
 in
 general,
 I
 like
 this
 name


as
 a
 as
 a
 play.


What
 do
 you
 think
 about
 Japan
 raising


rates
 next
 week?
 So,
 yes,
 that's
 going


to
 happen.
 I
 think
 that's
 priced
 in


because
 we
 all
 know
 I
 mean
 at least
 I


think
 the
 credit
 markets
 under
 I
 mean


based
 on
 the
 yield
 spiking
 I
 think
 we


know
 that
 Japan's
 raising
 rates.
 Could


that
 create
 a
 yen
 carry
 trade
 2.0?
 Yeah.


But
 then
 again
 like
 it's
 not
 like
 last


time
 they
 did
 it
 in
 August
 it
 was
 a


surprise.
 People
 didn't
 know
 they
 were


going
 to
 hike
 rates.
 This
 time
 I
 mean


it's
 pretty
 well
 known
 they're
 going
 to


hike
 rates.
 So


could
 there
 be
 a
 yen
 carry
 trade
 impact


from
 that
 next
 Friday?
 Yes.
 But
 I
 think


we've
 seen
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 over
 the
 past


couple
 weeks
 as
 well.


Um,


what's
 going
 on
 with
 ALAB?
 This
 one
 has


this
 one
 and
 AET
 have
 been


wow
 15%
 down.
 My
 goodness.


Ugly.
 This
 one's
 networking
 for
 data


centers
 as
 well.


All
 the
 data
 center
 names
 obviously


not
 really
 loving
 it
 right
 here.
 Is
 this


sign
 of
 an
 AI
 bubble?
 No,
 not
 in
 my


opinion.


It's
 not
 anything
 to
 do
 with
 AI
 bubble.


Now,
 could
 it
 turn
 into
 that?
 I
 mean,


yeah,
 if
 these
 data
 centers
 keep
 getting


delayed
 and
 eventually
 the
 market


imagines
 that
 there's
 no
 um
 money
 to
 be


paid
 for
 the
 data
 centers
 in
 the
 first


place,
 but
 can't
 just
 base
 it
 off


Oracle.
 I
 mean,
 we've
 gone
 through


dozens
 of
 data
 center
 headlines
 this


week.


over
 the
 past
 month,
 it's
 probably
 30
 to


40
 different
 headlines


of
 new
 data
 center
 buildout.


So
 the
 Oracle
 OpenAI
 stuff
 is
 one
 thing,


but
 that
 is
 not
 conducive
 or
 indicative


of
 the
 entire
 ecosystem
 for
 data


centers.
 Not
 to
 mention
 how
 much
 the


Trump
 administration
 is
 pushing
 these


companies
 to
 build
 and
 invest
 and


incentivizing
 them
 to
 keep
 doing
 it.


So
 I
 don't
 know.
 We're
 going
 to
 have
 to


see.


Um,


>> but
 yeah,
 I
 mean,
 look,
 I
 I'm
 I'm
 not


selling
 anything
 here.
 This
 is
 not
 a


this
 is
 not
 unless
 you
 want
 to
 lock
 in


some
 quick
 profits
 on
 something
 because


like
 if
 you
 bought
 Met
 at
 600
 and
 you


don't
 really
 care
 to
 hold
 it
 and
 you're


like,
 you
 know what,
 I'd
 rather
 just
 get


rid
 of
 it
 and
 keep
 the
 cash,
 that's


different.
 But


no,
 and
 this
 is
 this
 this
 is
 also
 not
 as


scary
 as
 the
 November
 crypto


deleveraging
 where
 it
 really
 felt
 based


on


Tom
 Lee's
 thesis
 that
 [ __ ]
 was
 really


broken.
 I
 mean,
 that
 felt
 like
 a
 way


bigger
 like
 reason
 to
 be
 afraid
 just


cuz,
 you
 know,
 that
 stuff
 could
 really


take
 down
 a
 decent
 chunk
 of
 the
 crypto


market.
 And
 that
 ended
 up
 not
 being
 that


big
 of
 a
 deal.
 Same
 thing
 with
 the
 rate


hike.
 Remember,
 we
 dropped
 two
 Thursdays


ago
 dramatically.
 Nvidia
 fell
 from
 like


190
 to
 170
 just
 based
 on
 Fed
 speak
 about


no
 rate
 cuts.
 Well,
 we
 got
 a
 rate
 cut.


We
 got
 a
 doubbish
 rate
 cut.


No,
 fundamentally


I
 don't
 see
 everything
 like
 I
 don't
 see


any
 any
 any
 unique
 reason
 to
 be
 super


excited
 to
 be
 like
 I
 got
 to
 get
 out
 of


this
 market.
 So
 this
 is
 all
 because
 of


Oracle.
 Yes,


it
 seems
 like
 this
 is
 all
 I
 mean
 is


Oracle
 and
 Broadcom
 together?
 That's


your
 one-two
 punch.
 But
 Oracle
 really


that
 headline
 really
 started
 getting
 the


market
 to
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 afraid.
 Uh
 you


got
 David
 Sachs
 on
 Bloomberg.
 Let's
 pull


this
 up.


safe
 as
 well.


>> Pour
 concrete
 or
 hang
 drywall,
 their


wages
 are
 up
 30%
 because
 this


infrastructure
 boom
 that's
 happening


right
 now.
 And
 there's
 actually
 a
 job


shortage
 in
 many
 of
 those
 trades,


meaning
 we
 need
 more
 workers
 going
 into


those
 trades.
 So,
 what
 we're
 seeing


right
 now
 is
 an
 overall
 AI
 boom
 that's


benefiting
 the
 economy.
 You
 know,
 the


the
 um
 the
 GDP
 growth
 rate
 was
 tracking


about
 4%
 and
 half
 of
 that
 up
 to
 half
 of


it
 has
 been
 attributed
 to
 AI.
 So,
 I
 just


think
 that
 this
 um
 this
 narrative
 about


job
 loss
 has
 been
 blown
 out
 of


proportion.
 Uh
 certainly
 there
 could
 be


job
 displacement
 in
 the
 future,
 but
 we


haven't
 seen
 any
 of
 that
 so
 far.
 It's


been
 quite
 the
 opposite.
 It's
 been
 job


gains.


>> David,
 uh
 final
 one
 on
 the
 EO
 if
 I
 may.


You
 know,
 what
 this
 EO
 allows
 for
 is
 it


the
 sort
 of
 hope
 that
 that
 it
 will
 lead


to
 the
 DOJ
 suing
 states
 like
 New
 York


and
 California?
 And
 if
 that's
 the
 case,


you
 know,
 the
 president
 and
 the


administration's
 confidence
 that
 you'd


win
 them.


>> Well,
 that
 is
 one
 of
 the
 tools
 that
 is


in
 the
 EO
 is
 that
 the
 DOJ
 um
 has
 been


tasked
 to
 form
 a
 litigation
 task
 force


that
 would
 have
 the
 ability
 to
 push
 back


on
 excessively
 burdensome
 state
 laws,


laws
 that
 may
 be
 unconstitutional,


violate
 the
 First
 Amendment,
 things
 like


that.
 By
 the
 way,
 the
 DOJ
 already
 had


that
 power.
 So,
 this
 is
 not
 a
 novel


power.
 But
 what's
 being
 done
 here
 in
 the


CEO
 is
 we're
 marshalling
 all
 the


resources
 of
 the
 federal
 government


behind
 the
 strategy
 of
 the
 president
 to


create
 a
 national
 framework.
 Now,
 in


terms
 of
 what
 laws
 we
 go
 after,
 that's
 a


decision
 that
 has
 been
 made.
 Um
 I,
 you


know,
 we
 haven't
 decided
 whether


California
 and
 New
 York
 should
 should
 be


targets
 in
 that
 way.
 Um
 the
 the
 the
 one


that
 I
 think
 is
 probably
 the
 most


excessive
 is
 this
 Colorado
 law
 that


seeks
 to
 prohibit
 algorithmic


discrimination,
 right?
 Uh
 what
 that


basically
 says
 is
 that
 if
 an
 AI
 model


has
 a
 disperate
 impact
 on
 a
 protected


group,
 then
 that
 model
 is
 violating
 the


law.
 Uh
 model
 developers,
 by
 the
 way,


have
 no
 idea
 how
 to
 comply
 with
 this


because
 they're
 not
 aware
 of
 all
 the


downstream
 uses
 of
 their
 model.
 I
 mean,


if
 a
 business
 decides
 to
 use
 an
 AI
 model


in
 a
 hiring
 decision,
 for example,


right?


>> That
 business
 is
 already
 on
 the
 hook
 for


discrimination.
 So,
 how
 would
 the
 model


developer
 know
 that
 it
 was
 being
 used
 in


that
 way?
 But
 what
 Colorado
 is
 trying
 to


do
 there
 is
 get
 their
 ideology
 inserted


into
 the
 model.
 That's
 very
 concerning


to
 us.
 We
 think
 there's
 a
 first


amendment
 issue
 there,
 but
 look,
 we


haven't
 made
 any
 decisions
 in
 terms
 of


how
 that
 litigation
 task
 force
 will
 be


used.


>> David,
 briefly,
 all
 of
 this
 is
 set
 in


the
 context
 of
 US
 versus
 China
 and
 are


deemed
 to
 run
 forward
 on
 AI
 development.


Meanwhile,
 it's
 been
 a
 busy
 week
 and


H200s
 might
 indeed
 be
 able
 to
 get
 to


China.
 How
 many
 do
 you
 think
 you'll
 do


in
 volumes?
 And
 what
 do
 you
 think
 the


appetite
 is
 of
 China
 to
 buy
 Nvidia's


more
 sophisticated
 chips?


>> Well,
 it's
 interesting.
 I
 just
 saw
 an


article
 that
 said
 that
 China
 was


rejecting
 the
 H200.
 So
 apparently
 they


don't
 want
 them.
 And
 I
 think
 the
 reason


for
 that
 is
 they
 want
 semiconductor


independence.
 The
 same
 way
 that
 the


United
 States
 wanted
 to
 be
 energy


independent,
 they
 want
 to
 be


semiconductor
 independent.
 So
 they're


rejecting
 our
 chips.
 And
 that's
 part
 of


the
 calculation
 that
 goes
 into
 the


decision
 of
 what
 we
 authorize
 to
 be
 sold


to
 China.
 The
 US
 policy
 has
 always
 been


that
 we
 don't
 allow
 the
 leading
 edge


chips
 and
 we're
 not.
 This
 is
 this
 H200


chip.
 It
 was
 state-of-the-art
 a
 couple


of
 years
 ago,
 but
 now
 it's
 been


superseded
 by
 the
 newer
 Blackwell


architecture
 and
 the
 Reuben
 architecture


that's
 coming
 out
 next
 year.
 So,
 this
 is


now
 a
 lagging
 chip,
 not
 a
 leading
 chip.


But
 what
 you
 see
 is
 China
 is
 not
 taking


them
 because
 they
 want
 to
 prop
 up
 and


subsidize
 Huawei.
 They
 want
 to
 create
 a


national
 champion.
 And
 that
 was
 part
 of


our
 calculation
 of
 selling
 not
 the
 best,


but
 lagging
 chips
 to
 China
 is
 you
 can


take
 market
 share
 away
 from
 Huawei.
 But


I
 think
 the
 Chinese
 government's
 figured


that
 out
 and
 that's
 why
 they're
 not


allowing
 them.
 David
 Saxs,
 we
 always


wish
 we
 had
 more
 time.
 White
 House
 AI.


>> All
 right,
 still
 lows
 of
 the
 day.
 Uh
 had


a
 little
 slight
 slight
 move
 up
 and
 then


that
 got
 rejected
 like
 two
 seconds
 ago.


67970
 down
 1.3
 on
 the
 S&P.


Core
 still
 down
 10.
 Oracle
 still
 down


five.


Q
 still
 down
 two.
 Meta
 still
 down
 two.


Yeah,
 still
 seeing
 a
 little
 pain
 right


here.
 Oracle
 springing
 up
 cash
 to
 out


bid
 Netflix.
 Dude,
 could
 you
 imagine
 the


real
 reason
 Oracle
 selling
 off
 is
 Larry


Ellson
 for
 the
 first
 time
 in
 like
 three


years
 is
 selling
 stock
 so
 that
 he
 can


offer


200
 billion
 for
 Netflix
 instead
 of
 100


billion
 or
 for
 Paramount
 or
 Warner


Brothers.


like
 they
 are
 so
 obsessed
 with
 getting


this
 freaking
 company.


That
 would
 be
 kind
 of
 funny
 if
 he


actually
 sold
 stock
 just
 to
 get
 more


money
 for
 that.
 But
 but but
 look
 again,


if
 I'm
 a
 Netflix
 lawyer,
 I
 go
 to
 the


court
 or
 I
 go
 to
 Paramount
 and
 I
 say,


"Look
 at
 Oracle
 stock.
 You
 guys
 think


you
 can
 backs
 stop
 an
 acquisition
 with


Larry
 Ellison's
 net
 worth?
 That
 [ __ ]


might
 be
 down
 by
 half
 if
 OpenAI
 doesn't


end
 up
 spending
 the
 money."
 Like,


there's
 no
 way
 you
 can
 trust
 that.
 Which


I
 don't
 think
 is
 a
 crazy
 argument.
 I


think
 it's
 rather
 compelling.
 just
 based


on
 the
 volatility
 of
 of
 the
 of
 the


stock.
 Netflix
 right
 there
 losing
 some


of
 its
 love.
 It
 was
 at
 97
 almost
 now


back
 in
 95.


But
 that
 is
 still
 down.


All right.
 I
 think
 do
 we
 nibble
 here?


I
 feel
 like
 it's
 at
 least
 time
 to
 nibble


a
 little
 bit.


I
 mean,
 we're
 down
 1.3%
 on
 the
 S&P.


Maybe
 it
 is
 a
 falling
 knife,
 but
 maybe


it's
 worth
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a


nibble.


All right,
 we're
 just
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the


favorites.
 We're
 going
 to
 keep
 it


simple.
 We're
 going
 to
 go
 to
 the


favorites.
 We're
 going
 to
 do
 hoodie.


Haven't
 bought
 in
 a
 while.
 We're
 going


to
 get
 below
 120.


We're
 going
 to
 go
 10
 shares
 Hood


11965


and
 go
 Nebius.


Let's
 do
 15
 shares
 Nebius
 8812.


First
 time
 I'm
 buying
 Nebus
 in
 three


weeks.
 First
 time
 I'm
 buying
 Hood
 in
 a


while.


There's
 Nebius.
 And
 with
 Hood,
 we
 had
 10


shares.


Um,


dude,
 Nvidia
 175,
 bro.


All right,
 I'm
 doing
 I'm
 doing
 10
 shares


in
 video.
 Doing
 10
 shares
 in
 video,
 too.


I'm
 just
 I'm
 not
 even
 trying
 anything


new
 here.
 I'm
 just
 daing
 into
 the
 the


names
 I
 already
 like.


Not
 trying
 anything
 new
 here.


Is
 there
 anything
 new
 that
 is
 super
 on


sale
 today?


Where's
 Zeta?


No,
 Zeta
 is
 not
 compelling
 enough.
 18.


Zeta's
 got
 to
 get
 back
 to
 16.


Uh,
 Sofi
 already
 bought
 last
 week.
 So,


we
 did
 10
 Hood,
 10
 Nebus,
 so
 we
 did
 15


Nebius,
 10
 Hood,
 10
 Nvidia.


Rock
 Lab's
 not
 on
 sale,
 guys.
 Rock
 Lab's


up
 40%
 this
 week.
 Rocket
 Lab's
 not
 on


sale.
 Love
 Rockab.


But


it's
 up
 a
 lot
 this
 week.
 It's
 not
 on


sale.


We're
 not
 buying
 Dolingo.


We
 have
 it
 in
 the
 ETF,
 but
 I'm
 not


touching
 that
 stupid
 green
 owl.
 Even


though
 I
 do
 think
 they
 have a
 moat.


I
 just
 think
 their
 narrative
 sucks.


Google's
 not
 on
 sale.
 I
 mean,
 yeah,
 like


look,
 Google,
 it's
 a
 good
 dip,
 but
 from


330,


but
 it's
 it's
 got
 to
 be
 more
 compelling.


Still
 above
 300.


VG,
 do
 I
 finally
 just
 borrow
 Matt
 and


Chris's
 conviction?


Look
 at
 this
 thing,
 bro.
 74%.


If
 I
 buy
 this,
 I'm
 legit
 going
 to
 set
 up


a
 freaking
 new
 Robinet
 account
 right
 now


and
 put
 the
 VG
 in
 there.


Oh
 my
 gosh.


Look,
 if
 I
 buy
 this,
 you
 guys
 cannot
 ask


me
 every
 day
 about
 BG
 because
 I
 don't


know
 anything
 about
 it.
 All
 I
 know
 is


Matt
 and
 Chris
 love
 this
 thing
 and
 they


are
 legit


in
 terms
 of
 their
 oil
 and
 gas
 analysis.


Definitely
 Matt
 given
 he
 works
 in
 the


industry.


So,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 the
 VG
 cult


leader.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


answer
 when
 this
 [ __ ]
 goes
 down
 again.


I
 will
 definitely
 brag
 when
 it
 goes


higher
 and
 be
 like,
 "VG,
 baby.
 Oil
 and


gas."
 But
 when
 it
 goes
 lower,
 don't
 ask


me
 to
 explain
 this
 [ __ ]
 because
 I
 don't


know
 what
 the
 hell
 they
 do
 other
 than


they're
 a
 global
 venture,
 which
 is
 what


they
 stand
 for.


All
 right,
 200
 shares,
 VG.
 We're
 in.


Don't
 ask
 me
 about
 this.
 I
 don't
 know


what
 this
 is.
 Okay.


I
 just
 know
 that
 Matt
 and
 Chris
 swear
 by


this
 damn
 thing.


All right,
 BG.
 We're
 in
 it.
 Officially


in
 it.


Dude,
 I'm
 buying
 more
 Grab,
 too.
 This
 is


getting
 stupid
 at
 this
 point.
 They
 got


the
 go-to
 thing
 coming
 up.


All
 right,
 we
 bought
 100
 a
 grab.


About
 100
 more
 grab.


That's
 it.
 I
 think
 that's
 it
 for
 that's


what
 like
 five
 grand
 that's
 not
 crazy
 10


hood
 10
 15
 Nebus
 10
 Nvidia
 it's
 about


seven
 grand


200
 VG


100
 gra


are
 we
 getting
 a
 little
 bounce
 right


here
 we
 got
 Hood
 120
 Neas
 I
 got
 Hood
 119


Nevius
 I
 got
 87
 that's
 89
 crab
 I
 got
 514


that's
 up
 a
 couple
 cents
 VG
 I'm
 already


up
 freaking


$7.
 That's
 a
 coffee.


Do
 we
 just
 get
 the
 bottom?
 Do
 we
 time


this
 [ __ ]


You
 know
 your
 boy.
 You
 know
 your
 boy.


Uh,
 no.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 it.
 Never


mind.
 Not
 going
 to
 say
 it.
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 say
 it.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 say
 something.


I'm
 not
 going
 to
 say
 it.
 But
 let's
 see


if
 we
 we
 got
 the
 bottom.


Is
 there
 anything
 else
 that's
 really
 on


sale
 though
 today?
 So,
 so
 I
 got
 VG
 is


the
 new
 one
 that
 we
 got
 today.


Everything
 else
 I
 already
 have
 some
 in.


Is
 there
 anything
 else
 that's
 like


actually
 discounted
 today?
 Like
 actually


red
 like
 like
 red
 red
 like
 stupid
 red.


Fermy
 is
 34%
 down,
 but
 I
 don't


understand
 that
 business
 too
 much.
 Um


uh
 TFC's
 green,
 Apple's
 red,


Amazon
 I've
 been
 buying.
 I'm
 not
 going


to
 buy
 Amazon
 here.
 I
 bought
 this
 at


219.


I
 ran
 I
 have
 Nebia
 so
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 I


can't
 cheat
 on
 Nebus
 guys.
 You
 gota
 this


is
 a
 you
 out
 of
 a
 monogous
 relationship


with
 these
 data
 centers.


So
 we
 bought
 last
 week.


Bloom
 energy.
 Okay.
 So
 look
 I
 got
 to
 do


more
 research
 on
 this.
 I'm
 interested.
 I


I
 I
 get
 it's
 down
 10%.
 I
 just
 I
 really


don't
 know
 enough
 about
 it
 to
 take
 a


shot
 here.
 So
 I
 re
 This
 is
 on
 the
 list


for
 deep
 dives
 though.
 There's
 a
 lot


more
 people
 that
 are
 getting
 excited


about
 this
 one.


I
 do
 have
 to
 look
 at
 it
 deeply.
 The
 BMR


is
 not
 on
 sale
 either,
 bro.
 BMR,
 I
 mean,


I
 get
 it's
 down
 six%,
 but
 it's
 up
 a
 lot


over
 the
 past
 couple
 weeks.


So,
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 that's
 necessarily
 on


sale.
 Also,
 it's
 not
 a
 new
 name
 that
 I'm


looking
 for.
 Netflix
 is
 also
 they


there's
 too
 much
 [ __ ]
 Netflix
 has
 to


deal
 with.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff
 that


they
 have
 to
 figure
 out.
 This
 is
 not
 at


40
 times
 earnings
 like
 super
 attractive


here.
 Especially
 because
 what
 do
 we


think
 Netflix
 is
 going
 to
 130
 anytime


soon?
 Even
 115.
 Like
 I
 don't
 see
 I'm


sorry.
 I
 just
 don't
 see
 that
 anytime


soon.
 There's
 a
 way
 too
 much
 overhang
 on


this
 stock.


So I
 know
 Netflix
 is
 not


the
 exciting
 one.


Alab
 I
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 like
 I've


got
 to
 relatively
 understand
 a
 little


bit
 about
 the
 company
 or
 I've
 got
 to


really
 have
 conviction
 in
 the
 person


that
 is
 pitching
 it
 which
 is
 I
 do
 for
 VG


with
 Matt
 and
 Chris


but
 I
 also
 got
 to
 know
 something
 about


the
 name
 if
 I'm
 going
 to
 try
 Shopify
 is


not
 on
 sale.
 Shopify
 is
 one
 it's
 down


2%.


Like
 the
 names
 that
 are
 really
 on
 sale


today
 are
 Broadcom
 but
 I
 don't
 like


Broadcom's
 multiple.
 If
 I'm
 buying


Nvidia,
 I'm
 not
 buying
 Broadcom
 here.


And
 the
 only
 other
 one
 that's
 really
 on


sale
 is
 Oracle,
 but
 Oracle
 has
 too
 much


of
 a
 bad
 narrative
 in
 terms
 of
 this
 uh


debt
 situation,
 which
 again,
 it
 might
 be


a
 good
 price
 here,
 but
 I
 don't


necessarily
 want
 to
 be
 tied
 to
 that.


CEG,


it's
 down
 5%.
 This
 one's
 had
 a
 big
 year


though,
 like
 a
 really
 big
 year
 with


their
 energy
 contracts.


Aren's
 below
 40.
 Tesla
 I
 wouldn't
 say
 is


necessarily
 on
 sale.
 Centress
 Energy,


why
 is
 Centric
 down
 10%.
 Dude,
 all
 the


energy.
 Okay,
 so
 it's
 not
 just
 Bloom.


Well,
 I
 guess
 they're
 all
 down
 because


the
 data
 centers
 trade
 is
 down
 and


energy
 demand
 is
 coming
 from
 data


centers.


G
 Veronova
 down
 4%.
 Although
 this
 has


had
 a
 really
 good
 week.
 Lemonade's
 down


5%,
 Microsoft
 down
 1%.
 Next
 decade
 down


three.
 Yeah,
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 energy
 names


are
 uh
 are
 getting
 hit.
 Costco.
 I
 can't


buy
 Costco
 because
 I
 value
 my
 friendship


with
 Steve.


Like


I
 have
 uh
 you
 know
 I
 have
 I
 have
 to


manage
 a
 friendship
 here.
 You
 guys
 want


me
 to
 freaking
 lose
 a
 friend
 over


Costco?
 How
 could
 how
 could
 we
 do
 that?


>> You
 do
 that
 for
 us
 today.


>> We'll
 start
 with
 that
 headline.
 Uh
 the


market
 certainly
 sniffing
 this
 open
 AAI


Oracle
 data
 center
 delay
 story
 as
 a


financing
 issue
 because
 remember
 the


street
 has
 been
 laser
 focused
 on


Oracle's
 $300
 billion
 deal
 Scott
 with


open
 AAI.
 So
 any
 signs
 of
 de delays
 the


market
 is
 going
 to
 be
 sensitive
 to
 and


yes
 it
 does
 follow
 a
 new
 10Q
 that
 was


filed
 by
 Oracle
 that
 shows
 a
 significant


increase
 in
 data
 center
 leases
 which
 as


a
 credit
 investor
 told
 me
 does
 raise
 the


likelihood
 of
 Oracle
 going
 to
 the
 debt


market
 sooner
 than
 expected.
 the
 street


was
 sort
 of
 anticipating
 early
 to
 mid


2026.
 Now
 the
 expectation
 is
 this
 needs


to
 happen
 in
 early
 uh
 2026.
 And
 then
 the


question
 is
 will
 it
 be
 a
 jumbo
 bond
 sale


or
 a
 term
 loan
 involving
 banks
 which


does
 increase
 the
 likelihood
 of
 those


banks
 using
 Oracle's
 credit
 default


swaps
 as
 a
 hedge?
 That's
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 we


>> Okay,
 so
 the
 credit
 default
 swaps
 for


Oracle
 are
 mooning.
 Again,
 if
 the


argument
 is,
 hey,
 instead
 of
 2026,
 it's


2027
 and
 that's
 causing
 all
 this
 pain


in
 that
 one
 year,
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 that's


enough
 to
 say,
 okay,
 the
 Oracle
 thesis


opening
 thesis
 is
 dead.
 Definitely


brings
 up
 questions.
 Not
 saying
 it


doesn't,
 and
 these
 are
 healthy


questions.
 That
 should
 not
 be
 enough
 to


freaking
 take
 us
 down
 back
 to
 650
 on
 the


S&P
 or
 anything
 crazy
 like
 that.


But
 that
 is
 the
 headline
 for
 those
 that


missed
 it.
 Oracle
 opening
 eye
 delay


means
 Oracle
 is
 going to
 issue
 debt


sooner
 than
 expected.
 And
 that's
 why


those
 stocks
 are
 getting
 hit
 and
 they're


taking
 the
 market
 down
 with
 it.
 Bloom


still
 down
 9%.
 IN
 is
 down
 seven.
 Amazon


down
 two.
 S&P
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 move.


Did
 uh
 did
 we
 nail
 the
 VG?
 Oh,
 dude.


644.


I'm
 up
 $21,
 bro.
 That's
 lunch
 on
 VG.


If
 we
 sold
 our
 VG,
 that
 is
 a
 nice
 $20


lunch
 that
 we
 got.


Look
 at
 that.
 633
 to
 644.
 Should
 have


bought
 a
 thousand
 shares.


Would
 have
 been
 able
 to
 buy
 a
 new
 scarf


at
 that
 point.


Um,


all
 right.
 What
 else?
 What
 else
 is
 still


hit
 today?
 Carnival,
 I
 mean,
 some
 of


this
 stuff
 is
 actually
 starting
 to


recover.
 S&P
 went
 from
 679
 to
 681.


So,
 we
 got
 Nebas
 at
 87,
 that's
 almost
 at


90.
 Hood
 at
 119,
 that's
 almost
 at
 121.


ENS
 is
 down
 because
 of
 the
 energy
 stuff,


but
 they're
 up
 from
 120
 to
 150
 in
 the


past
 two
 weeks.


So,
 I
 don't
 know if
 it's
 the
 most


attractive
 here
 given
 the
 run
 they've


had.
 Amcore,
 I'm
 waiting
 below
 40.
 That


thing's
 got
 to
 really
 give
 us
 a
 better


opportunity.


I
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 enough
 about
 ALAB.
 I


agree.
 ALAB's
 an
 opportunity.
 I
 just
 I


really
 don't
 know
 enough


about
 it.


Now
 you
 need
 to
 do
 VG
 weekly.
 Oh
 my


gosh.
 I
 should
 probably
 like
 figure
 out


how
 much
 revenue
 those
 guys
 do.
 That


would
 be
 important.


I
 knew
 I
 know
 they
 do
 like
 a
 billion
 in


IBIDA
 though,
 right?
 If
 I'm
 not
 wrong.


Like
 VG
 does
 a
 billion
 in
 IBIDA,
 which


means
 what's
 their
 market
 cap?
 15


times
 IBIDA.
 That's
 not
 crazy.
 Like


that's
 not
 insane.


Get
 Steve
 into
 it.
 I
 think
 Steve
 knows.


Well,
 no.
 Steve
 yesterday
 he
 said
 he
 he


doesn't
 like
 BG.
 He
 likes
 the
 pipelines


like
 Kinder
 Morgan
 more.


Kinder
 Morgan,
 that
 one's
 down
 a
 little


bit
 as
 well.


And
 is
 not
 a
 massive
 opportunity
 today.


It's
 down
 5%.
 I'm
 talking
 about
 what's


down
 like
 10,
 15,
 20%
 because
 this


Oracle
 AI
 stuff
 that's
 like
 screaming
 as


a
 buy


and
 the
 only
 two
 names
 are
 Broadcom
 and


Oracle.


But,
 you
 know,
 those
 are
 the
 hardest


names
 to
 buy
 on
 a
 day
 like
 this
 if
 you


don't
 really
 believe
 in
 the
 thesis.


Roblox
 is
 down
 4%.
 That's
 not
 crazy.


Oaklo,
 I'm
 sorry.
 I'm
 just
 not
 buying


Oakllo.


EOS
 has
 a
 really
 aggressive
 multiple,


but
 I
 agree.
 This
 is
 a
 great
 name
 in
 the


energy
 space.
 I
 really
 need
 to
 look
 into


them
 along
 with
 Bloom.
 Obviously,
 all


the
 energy
 names
 are
 getting
 hit,


but
 dude,
 you
 gota
 you
 you
 got
 to


overlook
 the
 multiple
 on
 EOSC.
 65
 times


sales
 and
 just
 believe
 in
 a
 growth


story.


TE
 I've
 heard
 of
 TE.
 I
 This
 is
 another


energy
 name,
 right?
 Down
 7%
 10%.


Okay,
 so
 definitely
 the
 sector
 on
 sale


we
 can
 see
 is
 energy
 100%.
 It's
 also
 the


sector
 I
 know
 the
 least
 about,
 which
 is


something
 we
 need
 to
 change
 going
 into


2026.
 But
 yes,
 I
 agree.


It's
 hard
 for
 me
 to
 just
 randomly
 buy


them
 because
 I
 don't
 know
 a
 lot
 about


these
 companies,
 but
 all
 of
 them
 on


sale.
 And
 it's
 funny
 because
 any
 data


center
 hiccup,
 forget
 the
 neoclouds
 that


will
 go
 on
 sale,
 the
 energy
 stocks


immediately
 go
 on
 sale
 because
 right
 now


all
 the
 energy
 utility
 demand
 is
 propped


up
 by
 data
 centers,
 which
 again,
 Jensen,


for
 those
 that
 missed
 the
 headline


yesterday,
 he's
 hosting
 some
 summit
 next


week
 about
 power
 shortages
 via
 the
 data


center
 buildout.
 So
 even
 Jensen's


recognizing
 that
 for
 him
 to
 keep
 selling


these
 chips,
 he
 needs
 to
 make
 sure
 that


the
 grid
 is
 secure,
 which
 could
 actually


be
 a
 really
 uh
 buy
 the
 news
 event
 on
 on


the
 energy
 names
 if
 Jensen
 like


announces
 like
 imagine
 Jensen
 says
 we


are
 investing
 100
 billion
 in


electrification
 for
 the
 grid
 or


something
 crazy
 like
 that


which
 I
 mean
 I
 think
 the
 street
 would


get
 really
 excited
 about
 just
 someone


being
 very
 committed
 to
 the
 grid
 being


maintained.
 Rivian
 has
 not
 shown
 any


weakness
 today
 in
 the
 face
 of
 all
 this


red
 17
 freaking
 percent


which
 is
 incredible.


Yeah,
 look
 GE
 Veronova
 and
 Constellation


are
 very
 high
 quality
 energy
 names
 that


I
 that
 I
 deeply
 want
 to
 look
 into.
 They


are
 not
 your
 typical
 energy
 name
 because


you
 know
 they
 have
 decades
 long
 of


experience
 in
 terms
 of
 building
 a


business
 rooted
 in
 energy
 and
 they're


now
 just
 getting
 this
 massive
 demand


lift


and
 they're
 increasing
 the
 dividend


buyback.
 So
 those
 are


definitely
 names
 to
 to
 take
 into


account.
 Lulu
 also
 Lulu
 and
 Rivian
 kind


of
 going
 against
 the
 market
 here.
 Lulu


still
 up
 10,
 Rivian
 up
 19.
 VG's
 up


three.


All
 right,
 we
 got
 Nvidia
 at
 175.
 It's
 at


17.
 What
 did
 we
 get
 Nvidia
 at?
 We
 got


Nvidia
 at


17590.


All right,
 so
 we
 got
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a


move
 right
 up
 there.
 Let's
 get
 a
 little


bit
 more
 coverage
 here
 on
 Oracle


and
 keep
 going
 from
 there.


>> Where
 investors
 typically
 don't


>> minute
 ago,
 I'm
 going
 to
 use
 it
 again.


This
 is
 now
 a
 speculative
 stock,
 but
 if


it
 comes
 through
 and
 by
 it,
 I
 mean
 Larry


Ellison,
 I
 do
 mean
 Sam
 Al.
 And
 I
 mean


Open
 AAI,
 this
 is
 a
 stock
 that
 180
 right


now
 will
 be
 over
 $300
 kind
 of
 in
 the


blink
 of
 an
 eye.
 And
 by
 the
 time
 the


market
 figures
 that
 out,
 it's
 already


going
 to
 be
 much
 higher.


>> But
 what
 do
 you
 have
 to
 see
 or
 what
 does


the
 market
 have
 to
 see
 to
 get
 this
 stock


to
 move
 up
 that
 percentage?


>> It's
 going
 to
 take
 some
 time.
 And
 by


time,
 I
 mean
 another
 quarter
 or
 two


because
 as
 Sema
 was
 just
 talking
 about,


it's
 in
 the
 next
 quarter
 or
 two
 that


this
 funding
 needs
 to
 come
 through.
 And


that's
 an
 overhang
 right
 now.
 We
 know


that.
 That
 is
 part
 of
 what
 really
 think


of
 what
 next
 quarter
 or
 two
 that
 seems


completely
 unreasonable


>> because
 because
 what's
 really
 vexing
 me


right
 now
 are
 the
 credit
 default
 swaps


and
 as
 Sema
 just
 pointed
 out
 that
 may


well
 be
 the
 banks
 hedging
 in
 advance
 of


financing
 that's
 going
 to
 come
 in
 over


the
 next
 quarter
 or
 two
 which
 again
 is


why
 the
 stock
 is
 also
 getting
 hit.
 Doug


says
 keep
 in
 mind
 we
 are
 probably
 down


because
 Chris
 bought
 Nvidia.
 Chris


admitted
 it
 last
 night
 on
 the
 close.
 He


said
 look
 guys
 it's
 probably
 at
 the
 top


now
 that
 I'm
 bullish
 on
 Nvidia.
 So
 that


is
 a
 fair
 point.


Hopefully
 Chris
 is
 taking
 some
 time
 to


DCA


into
 uh


into
 Nvidia.


Um


Doug,
 thanks
 for
 the
 super
 chat.
 This
 is


the
 opposite
 of
 a
 bubble.
 Bubbles
 don't


get
 10%
 drops
 on
 good
 earnings
 of
 the


eighth
 largest
 company.
 Bubbles
 don't


ignore
 the
 greatest
 two
 earnings
 reports


in
 history
 like
 Nvidia
 and
 Pounder.


Yeah.
 I
 mean,
 if
 if
 if


a
 10%
 drop
 on
 the
 eighth
 largest
 company


in
 the
 market


were
 to
 collapse
 the
 entire
 market,
 then


that
 means
 that
 company
 should
 have


never
 been
 the
 eighth
 largest
 company
 in


the
 market.
 So,
 we're
 talking
 about
 a


10%
 drop
 in
 a
 $2
 trillion
 company.
 That


should
 be
 hopefully
 enough
 of
 the
 pain,


but
 it
 also
 is
 not
 indicative
 by
 any


sense
 of
 the
 imagination
 that
 that's
 a


bubble.
 10,000%
 would
 agree
 with
 that.


Staples,
 thanks
 for
 becoming
 a
 channel


member.
 Appreciate
 it.


Um,


and
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 here.
 Wing
 says,


"What
 is
 going
 on
 today?
 I'm
 at
 work
 and


I'm
 busy."
 The
 Oracle
 headline
 that
 we


just
 talked
 about
 that
 is
 creating
 more


of
 the
 pain.
 Opening
 eye
 with
 the
 delay


on
 that
 data
 center
 is
 what's
 causing


that
 spike.
 We're
 getting
 a
 little
 I


don't
 want
 to
 say
 recovery,
 but
 a
 little


bit
 of
 a
 move
 higher.


Not
 at
 the
 lows
 of
 the
 day,
 but
 still


still
 pretty
 red
 regardless


on
 Friday.
 Fear
 and
 greed
 right
 now.


Still
 at
 41
 for
 fear.
 We
 were
 at
 45
 in


the
 morning.
 But
 if
 you
 get
 that


financing
 done
 and
 the
 pressure
 comes


off
 of
 the
 credit
 default
 swaps,
 I
 think


people
 are
 going
 to
 look
 at
 a
 a
 decline


in
 the
 credit
 default
 swaps,
 if
 it


occurs,


>> they're
 they're
 a
 proxy,
 not
 just
 for


Oracle,
 but
 they're
 a
 proxy
 and
 a
 way
 to


hedge
 the
 AI
 trade.
 Exactly.
 So,
 there's


an
 inflated
 number
 there.
 That's
 not


just
 to
 to to
 back
 Steve
 up
 on
 this.


This
 isn't
 just
 an
 Oracle
 story.
 It's


the
 only
 place
 you
 can
 go
 where
 you're


going to
 see


>> that
 is
 a
 really
 good
 point.
 The
 Oracle


credit
 default
 swaps
 are
 not
 bearish


Oracle.
 They're
 bearish
 AI
 in
 general.


So,
 they're
 being
 seen
 as
 a
 proxy.
 By


the
 way,
 those
 credit
 default
 swaps
 are


up
 200%
 in
 the
 past
 three
 months
 to
 go


against
 AI
 or
 to
 at least
 hedge
 against


AI,
 which
 ends
 up
 hurting
 Oracle
 stock,


but
 nonetheless,
 it
 is
 something
 the


credit
 market
 is
 using
 as
 a
 vehicle,
 not


necessarily
 as
 a
 direct
 correlation


between
 being
 bearish
 about
 Oracle.


>> This
 debt
 where
 you
 can
 go
 and
 be
 hedged


across
 the
 trades.
 Oh,
 of
 course.
 This


whole
 thing
 is
 a
 proxy
 for
 the
 AI.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 everything
 almost.
 It's
 like
 a
 AI


hopes,
 AI
 dreams,
 AI
 jitters,
 AI
 doesn't


work
 out.
 I
 mean,
 this
 stock
 and
 CDS
 are


sort
 of
 reflecting
 everything.


>> And
 I
 don't
 think
 this
 works,
 by
 the


way,
 until
 you
 start
 to
 see
 real
 revenue


from
 open
 AI.
 It's
 not
 going
 to
 be
 a


quarter
 two.
 It's
 a
 market
 is
 assuming


that
 they're
 going
 to
 be
 get
 the


lending.
 They're
 going
 to
 get
 the


>> It's
 worth
 pointing
 out
 that
 while
 open


AI
 is
 a
 huge
 part,
 more
 than
 50%
 of
 the


remaining
 performance
 obligation
 at


Oracle.
 It's
 not
 all
 of
 the
 RPO.
 It's


about
 55%.
 There's
 a
 lot
 from
 the
 other


AI
 players
 that
 frankly
 if
 just
 that


comes
 through,
 this
 is
 a
 cheap
 stock.


>> How
 about
 how
 about
 this?
 So,
 if
 you


look
 at
 where
 the
 pain
 is
 being
 felt


today,
 of
 course,
 you
 look
 at
 the
 power


players.
 Take
 a
 look
 at
 some
 of
 these


names.
 Let's
 cycle
 through
 as
 many
 as
 as


we
 can
 show.
 Giverova
 is
 coming
 off
 a


monster
 day
 in
 a
 huge
 week
 for
 that


stock.
 Let's
 show
 the
 week,
 right?


Because
 they
 had
 their
 investor
 day
 and


they
 blew
 everybody
 away
 and
 the
 stock


was
 great.
 And
 then
 obviously
 look
 at


that.
 That
 that's
 the
 week.
 Now
 it's


down
 4%
 today.
 Constellation,
 Eaton,


Next
 Era,
 Quant,
 Verdive,
 Brenda,
 you've


got
 Eaton
 and
 Quant
 2.
 These
 are
 the


places
 that
 you
 look
 if
 you're
 worried


about
 this
 trade
 and
 the
 durability
 of


it,
 whether
 some
 of
 these
 stocks
 have


simply
 just
 been
 bid
 up
 too
 far
 on
 where


the
 expectations
 are
 expected
 to
 be.


Thus,
 the
 valuations
 have
 expanded
 as


well.


>> I
 think
 there's
 still
 room
 for
 grid


investments
 and
 a
 need
 for
 more


electrification.
 It's
 not
 just
 a
 data


center
 play,
 but
 I
 hear
 you.
 a
 lot
 of


these
 stocks
 have
 really
 had
 a
 a


tremendous
 year
 and
 and
 that's
 uh


reflected
 in
 the
 valuation.
 Uh
 but
 I
 do


think
 the
 fundamental
 story
 there
 is


still
 good.
 So
 on
 a
 day
 like
 today,
 we


would
 be
 more
 a
 buyer
 or
 adding
 to


positions
 rather
 than
 uh
 selling
 because


I
 don't
 think
 over
 the
 next
 few
 years


that
 this
 trend
 is
 going
 to
 change.
 that


we
 can
 look
 out
 to
 2028
 that's
 still
 a


ways
 away
 and
 I
 think
 the
 fundamental


story
 is
 still
 going
 to
 be
 positive


especially
 for
 these
 companies
 that
 are


you
 know
 really
 directly
 tied
 to
 grid


investments
 or
 electrification
 which
 is


an
 onshoring
 story
 and
 other
 things
 that


are
 playing
 into
 that
 strength
 it's
 not


just
 data
 centers


>> and
 and
 I
 agree
 with
 her
 if
 you
 think


this
 theme
 around
 data
 centers
 is
 not


slowing
 down
 then
 an
 openi
 delay
 on
 an


Oracle
 data
 center
 like
 that's
 just
 Not


that's
 not
 the
 reason
 to
 be
 super
 upset


or
 scared.


At least
 that's
 it
 doesn't
 feel
 like


that's
 the
 reason
 to
 be
 super
 upset
 or


scared.


S&P,
 where
 are
 we
 at?
 All right,
 folks.


I
 think
 we'll
 end
 it
 right
 here.
 S&P


682.
 Okay,
 so
 up
 from
 679
 to
 682.
 Not
 a


full
 V,
 but
 the
 inklings
 of
 a
 V,


which
 is
 nice
 to
 see.
 I
 should
 have
 worn


my
 scarf
 right
 when
 I
 was
 buying
 stocks.


Then
 then
 we
 could
 have
 really
 said
 the


scarf
 is
 needed
 for
 a
 bull
 market.
 But


then
 I
 would
 have
 never
 been
 able
 to.
 It


would
 be
 freaking
 July
 be
 like
 a
 man,


wear
 the
 scarf.
 Time
 to
 put
 on
 the


scarf.
 We
 need
 some
 need
 some
 green.


But
 there
 you
 go.
 We'll
 see.
 Maybe
 this


reverses
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.


Looks
 like
 that
 679
 low
 might
 have
 been


the
 low
 for
 for
 the
 day.
 Markets
 are


emotional,
 irrational.
 Maybe
 they're


going
 to
 wake
 up
 in
 20
 minutes
 and
 be


like,
 "Hey,
 the
 data
 center
 headline
 is


not
 that
 serious."
 I
 ran
 up
 from
 39
 to


41.
 Amazon
 still
 226.
 So
 almost
 27
 up


from
 2620.
 Nebius
 91
 from
 86.
 Even


Cororeef
 77
 to
 80.
 Meta
 638
 to
 643.
 Yeah


guys,
 this
 looks
 across
 the
 board.
 Look


at
 the
 cues
 611
 to
 615.


This
 looks
 across
 the
 board
 like
 it


should
 have
 the
 resemblance
 of
 a
 V


towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,


but
 we'll
 be
 back
 for
 the
 market
 close


and
 we'll
 see
 if
 that's
 the
 case.


All right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody


for
 being
 here.
 Let's
 do
 word
 of
 the
 day


and
 then
 I'll
 be
 out.
 I'll
 be
 live
 on


the
 close.
 We'll
 see
 what
 we've
 got


going
 on.
 By
 the
 way,
 Steve
 probably


doesn't
 even
 know
 the
 market's
 down.


This
 is
 what
 this
 guy
 just
 texted
 me.


Nice
 little
 Patsies
 for
 lunch.


Look
 at
 those
 meatballs.


Well,
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 took
 my
 sister
 and


cousin
 to
 Patsies
 uh
 over
 Thanksgiving


and
 they
 love
 the
 meatballs
 as
 well.
 If


anyone's
 in
 New
 York,
 Pats
 is
 the
 spot


to
 go.
 It's
 got
 to
 be
 the
 spot
 to
 get


some
 good
 Italian
 food.
 Poem
 of
 the
 day.


Don't
 tempt
 me.
 Don't
 tempt
 me.
 I


already
 went
 0
 for
 four
 on
 the
 poems


today.
 Don't
 make
 me
 go
 0
 for
 five
 cuz


I'll
 try
 to
 go
 one
 for
 five


cuz
 it's
 the
 attempt
 that
 counts.


I
 will
 try.
 Don't
 tempt
 me.
 I
 will.
 I


will
 try.
 Word
 of
 the
 day.
 Interemporal


optimization.


The
 process
 of
 making
 decisions
 that


balance
 trade-offs
 between
 returns
 and


risks
 across
 different
 points
 in
 time


rather
 than
 maximizing
 a
 single
 period


outcome.


A
 disciplined
 option
 seller
 practices


intertemporal
 optimization
 by


sacrificing
 short-term
 yield
 to
 preserve


long-term
 capital
 efficiency.


Okay,
 I've
 never
 heard
 that
 word
 before


or
 this
 phrase,
 but
 it
 is
 the
 process
 of


making
 decisions
 that
 balance
 trade-offs


between
 returns
 and
 risks
 across


different
 points
 in
 time
 rather
 than


maximizing
 a
 single
 period
 outcome.
 I


think
 all
 of
 us
 to
 an
 extent
 are


navigating
 intertemporal


optimization
 in
 our
 portfolios


and
 maybe
 today
 you've
 engaged
 in


intertemporal
 optimization
 either
 by


selling
 something
 to
 balance
 some
 risk


or
 buying
 something
 and
 trading
 off
 with


a
 different
 portfolio
 move
 to
 take


advantage


of
 this
 dip
 that
 potentially
 is
 turning


into
 a
 Vshape.


I
 guess
 we're
 going
 to
 see
 how
 this


turns
 out
 towards
 the
 end
 of
 the
 uh
 the


end
 of
 the
 close.
 All
 right,
 that's
 it.


Thank
 everybody.
 Hopefully,
 we
 end
 out


not
 even
 green,
 but
 just
 a
 little
 bit


better
 than
 where
 we
 were
 at
 the
 very


lows.


I
 mean,
 this
 thing
 is
 trying.
 She's


really
 trying.
 BG
 Grab
 just
 went
 green.


Nvidia
 177.
 She's
 trying.
 We're
 going
 to


see.
 We're
 going
 to
 see
 by
 the
 end
 of


the
 day.


No,
 no
 poem.
 Don't
 tempt
 me
 for
 the


poem,
 bro,
 cuz
 I
 will
 sit
 here
 and


think.
 I
 already
 kept
 you
 guys
 here
 for


almost
 4
 hours.
 I
 will
 sit
 and
 think
 for


a
 poem.


Don't
 freaking
 tempt
 me
 on
 it.


But
 your
 boy
 might
 have
 a
 poem
 on
 the


market
 close.
 You
 might
 I
 might
 spend


the
 next
 couple
 hours
 thinking
 of
 one,


aka
 asking
 Chad
 GBT
 for
 a
 poem.
 All


right,
 that's
 it.
 Thank
 everybody.
 I'll


see
 you
 guys
 on
 the
 market
 close.
 Bye


everybody.
 Have
 a
 good
 one.
