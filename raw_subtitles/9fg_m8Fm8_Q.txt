Do
 you
 just
 want
 me
 to
 run
 through
 the


different
 sounds?
 Okay.
 Um,
 so
 yeah,
 a


simple
 quack
 is
 just


>> and
 then
 a
 lot
 of
 times
 this
 morning
 to


grab
 those
 ducks
 attention,
 I
 was
 doing


five
 to
 seven
 quacks
 in
 a
 row.


So
 yeah,
 it's
 just
 just
 like
 music.


>> You're
 one
 with
 the
 duck.


>> I
 try
 to
 be.
 I
 try
 my
 best.
 [music]


>> [music]


>> When
 most
 of
 us
 sit
 down
 today
 for


Thanksgiving
 dinner,
 if
 we're
 being


honest,
 we're
 not
 really
 thinking
 all


that
 hard
 about
 where
 [music]
 the
 food


on
 the
 table
 actually
 came
 from.
 It
 came


from
 the
 grocery
 store.
 And
 to
 the


[music]
 degree
 that
 we
 did
 think
 about


where
 it
 came
 from,
 maybe
 we
 shopped
 the


local
 [music]
 freerange
 organic
 aisle,


still
 it
 came
 from
 the
 supermarket.


But
 for
 Steven
 Reanella,
 the
 question
 of


where
 his
 food
 comes
 from
 is
 almost
 a


religion.
 Reanella
 is
 a
 lifelong
 hunter,


perhaps
 the
 country's
 most
 famous


hunter,
 who
 shares
 his
 passion
 for


eating
 what
 he
 catches
 through
 a
 growing


media
 empire
 that
 includes
 a
 Netflix


show
 and
 a
 podcast,
 both
 called
 Meat


Eater.


>> If
 you're
 just
 by
 yourself
 and
 you
 kill


a
 moose
 in
 September,


>> Yeah.


>> how
 long
 can
 one
 guy
 live
 off
 that


moose?


um
 you
 know,
 if
 that's
 all
 you're


eating,
 um
 you
 know,
 probably
 3
 months.


>> Mhm.


>> He's
 also
 written
 more
 than
 a
 dozen


books,
 ranging
 from
 a
 history
 of
 the


American
 buffalo
 to
 a
 series
 of


cookbooks
 that
 explain
 things
 like
 how


to
 gut
 a
 caribou
 or
 make
 a
 wild
 goose


pastrami.
 But
 what
 really
 defines


Ranella's
 work
 is
 an
 argument
 and
 an


argument
 that
 some
 might
 find
 kind
 of


counterintuitive
 that
 killing
 animals


can
 be
 part
 of
 loving
 [music]
 nature.


That
 reverence
 for
 the
 natural
 world
 is


intimately
 bound
 up
 in
 the
 act
 of


hunting.
 [music]


And
 so
 I
 was
 curious
 as
 somebody
 who


relies
 [music]
 exclusively
 on
 the


grocery
 store,
 what
 would
 it
 be
 like
 to


visit
 Reanella
 and
 go
 on
 a
 hunt
 with
 him


and
 then
 eat
 what
 we
 kill.
 [music]


From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Bubaro.
 [music]


This
 is
 the
 Daily.
 Today,


my
 hunt
 with
 Steven
 Reinella.


It's
 Thursday,
 November
 27th,


Thanksgiving
 Day.


>> Steve,
 Michael
 Barbaro.


>> Michael,
 nice
 to
 meet
 you.


>> Tremendous
 honor.


>> Mon
 way.


>> We
 meet
 Reinella
 at
 the
 meate
 eater


headquarters
 in
 Bosezeman,
 Montana.


>> Here,
 I'll
 show
 you
 around
 a
 little
 bit.


>> He
 gives
 us
 a
 little
 tour.


>> We
 have
 a
 a
 kitchen
 space.


>> We
 see
 his
 test
 kitchen.


>> Oh,
 that's
 a
 giant
 meat
 grinder.
 Wow.


his
 industrialsized


meat
 freezer.


>> This
 is
 like
 Giannis's
 elk
 bones.


>> On
 the
 way,


>> should
 we
 go
 to
 the
 studio?


>> into
 his
 podcast
 studio,
 which
 I
 would


describe
 the
 decor
 of
 as
 extremely


carnivorous.


>> This
 is
 a
 beaver


>> behind
 you.


>> Yeah.
 This
 is
 like
 what
 the
 whole


country
 was
 built
 on.
 I
 mean,
 you
 know,


like
 that
 the
 beaver
 skin
 trade.
 Um,


that's
 a
 muskox


hide.


>> That's
 huge.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 a
 sound
 deadener.
 These
 are


these
 are
 tan
 skunks.


>> Mhm.


>> Okay.
 A
 thing
 I've
 always
 been
 I
 pay
 a


lot
 of
 attention
 to
 the
 fur
 trade.
 This


right
 now
 is
 the
 hot
 ticket
 item
 in
 the


fur
 trade.


>> Skunk.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know
 why?


>> No.


>> The
 the
 hats
 that
 Orthodox
 Jews
 wear
 for


for
 for
 holidays.


>> Yes.
 They're
 very
 extravagant.
 They're


beautiful.


>> The
 hip
 thing
 right
 now,
 the
 hip
 thing


is
 to
 have
 those
 white
 to
 have
 them
 made


from
 those
 white
 skunk
 hairs.
 I
 think
 of


the
 Orthodox
 community
 as
 being
 kind
 of


trend
 proof,
 but


>> no,
 they're
 not.
 There's
 a
 trend.
 It's


hot.
 [laughter]


>> Okay.
 So,
 thank
 you
 for
 the
 tour.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 having
 us.


>> Of
 course.
 Thank
 you.
 I
 appreciate
 you


coming
 in,
 especially
 coming
 all
 this


way
 to
 come
 to
 me.


>> So,
 you
 have
 had


a
 really
 interesting
 journey
 in
 my


estimation
 to
 become
 the
 person
 that
 you


are
 now.
 You're
 kind
 of
 an
 evangelist


for
 hunting.
 Champion
 of
 hunting
 as
 a


way


>> I'm
 like
 an
 like
 an
 explainer
 of


>> Yeah.
 Okay.
 you
 know,
 explainer
 of


>> champion
 of
 it
 as
 a
 way
 of
 connecting


with
 the
 land,
 showing
 reverence
 for
 the


land,


>> and
 as
 you've
 put
 it,
 understanding
 the


connection
 between
 human
 beings
 and
 the


natural
 world.


>> Mhm.


>> You
 grew
 up
 in
 rural
 Michigan.


>> That's
 right.


>> Talk
 to
 me
 a
 little
 bit
 about
 some
 of


these
 formative
 early
 hunting


experiences


>> that
 you
 have.


>> To
 do
 that
 right,
 I
 got
 to
 go
 back
 one


little
 generational
 bit.


My
 dad
 was
 born
 a
 long
 time
 ago.
 Like
 he


fought
 in
 World
 War
 II,
 okay?
 So
 my
 dad


was
 raised
 by
 Italian
 immigrant


grandparents.
 He
 was
 born
 in
 the
 south


side
 of
 Chicago.
 He
 grew
 up
 in
 a
 world


very,
 very
 removed
 from
 rural
 American


life.


But
 then
 when
 he
 got
 home
 from
 World
 War


II,
 and
 this
 is
 a
 thing
 that
 he
 was
 one


of
 those
 outdoorsmen
 that
 kind
 of
 was


born
 of
 that
 experience.
 They
 had
 been


out,
 you
 know,
 for
 over
 a
 year.
 you'd


been
 out
 camping,
 out
 hanging
 out
 with


guys,
 wearing
 wool
 clothes,
 and
 he
 was


just
 they
 just
 got
 into
 it.
 Then
 when


they
 came
 home,
 that's
 just
 what
 they


did.


>> There
 was
 even
 a
 comment
 a
 guy
 a
 editor


of
 a
 sporting
 magazine
 had
 made
 is
 like,


"How
 could
 you
 how
 could
 you
 train
 an


entire
 generation
 of
 men
 to
 to
 shoot
 and


camp
 and
 not
 expect
 them


>> to
 become
 hunters?"
 So
 he
 became
 a


hunter
 like
 out
 of
 that
 world.


>> I
 never
 thought
 about
 that.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 and
 so
 I
 got
 it
 from
 him.


Like
 I
 never
 decided
 I
 never
 thought,


"Oh,
 I
 should
 become
 a
 hunter
 and


fisherman."
 It
 was
 just
 what
 we
 did.
 I


did
 all
 the
 like
 I
 had
 all
 the
 normal


stuff.
 I
 had
 friends.
 I
 liked
 music.


Alongside
 it
 all
 was
 like
 this
 this
 like


obsession,


a
 family
 obsession
 with
 hunting
 and


fishing.


>> Do
 you
 remember
 an
 early
 experience
 of


hunting
 that
 stays
 with
 you?
 Yeah,
 we


would
 strike
 out
 on
 bikes
 with
 22s
 and


go
 hunt
 squirrels,
 but
 we
 had
 so
 much


woods
 around
 and
 we
 thought
 it
 was
 like


public,
 but
 it
 was
 just
 a
 We
 just
 went


on
 everybody
 everybody's
 land.
 Um,


>> why
 hunt
 a
 squirrel?


>> Oh,
 they're
 great.


>> There's
 not
 that
 much
 meat.


>> No,
 there's
 a
 lot.


>> There
 is?


>> Yeah,
 there's
 a
 lot.


>> And
 what
 do
 you
 do
 with
 it?


>> Oh,
 it's
 it's
 it's
 it's
 like
 it's


thinking
 man's
 chicken,
 man.
 It's
 like


it's
 it's
 the
 same
 color.
 My
 mom
 would


there
 was
 a
 real
 wild
 game
 craze
 back


then.
 It
 was
 like
 the
 whole
 era
 was
 like


the
 cream
 of
 mushroom
 era.
 So
 my
 mom


would
 take
 a
 crockpot
 and
 fill
 it
 full


of
 parted
 out
 squirrels.
 So
 two
 front


legs,
 two
 back
 legs,
 and
 we
 trim
 the


saddle.


>> You
 call
 it
 the
 saddle.


>> It'd
 be
 like
 the
 loin
 pieces.
 You
 like


take
 a
 scissor
 and
 run
 it
 up
 the
 ribs.


>> And
 so
 you
 got
 like
 like
 the
 the
 French


call
 it
 a
 saddle
 of
 a
 hair,
 right?
 and


you'd
 put
 it
 in
 a
 crock
 pot,
 fill
 it


with
 cream
 of
 mushroom
 soup,
 and
 then


turn
 that
 crockpot
 on.
 And
 then
 the


minute
 you
 could
 pick
 all
 the
 meat
 off,


you'd
 pick
 all
 the
 meat
 off.


>> Thinking
 man's
 chicken.


>> It


enjoy
 food
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 a
 set


rigid
 idea
 of
 whatever
 you
 kind
 of
 like


like
 meat
 supposed
 to
 be
 like
 this.
 If


you
 just
 kind
 of
 like
 like
 food
 and
 like


novel
 things,
 most
 people
 that
 do
 that


like
 squirrels.
 They're
 they're
 very


good.


>> I
 had
 no
 idea.


>> Yeah.
 At
 this
 stage
 of
 your
 life,
 are


you
 eating
 everything
 you
 hunt?


>> Yeah,
 we
 ate
 a
 lot
 of
 stuff.
 We
 fried
 a


lot
 of
 stuff.
 Yeah.
 You
 wouldn't
 have


thrown
 that
 would
 not
 be
 a
 thing
 like


not
 a
 thing.
 And


>> to
 hunt
 and
 not
 consume.


>> I
 remember.


>> Would
 it
 be
 a
 sin?


>> Yeah.
 Sin.
 Like,
 you
 know,
 I
 was
 raised


in
 a
 Christian
 household.
 We
 wouldn't


have
 talked
 about
 waste
 in
 terms
 of
 sin.


But
 I
 remember
 one
 time
 in
 the
 woods,
 I


remember
 my
 old
 man
 finding
 someone
 had


dumped
 a
 bunch
 of
 wood
 ducks
 that
 they


hadn't
 cleaned
 properly.


>> M


>> in
 this
 that
 they
 had
 hunted
 but
 not


cleaned.


>> Yep.
 Garbage
 bag.
 It
 was
 where
 everybody


would
 haul
 their
 yard
 waste.
 And
 I


remember
 my
 old
 man
 finding
 a
 a
 garbage


bag
 that
 had
 a
 bunch
 of
 improperly


cleaned
 wood
 ducks.
 And
 it
 was
 this
 dude


renting
 a
 house
 down
 the
 lake
 from
 us.


And
 I
 remember
 my
 dad
 went
 banged
 on
 his


door
 and
 had
 words
 with
 him.


It
 was
 like


>> well
 just
 he
 he
 would
 have
 seen
 that
 as


so
 problematic.
 Why


>> wasteful?


Like
 that
 was
 the
 thing
 I
 I
 was
 trying


to
 explain.


>> These
 animals
 lived
 and
 died
 for
 nothing


if
 no
 one
 was
 going
 to


>> it
 was
 like
 you
 didn't
 waste
 stuff,
 man.


>> After
 being
 immersed
 in
 this


environment,
 did
 you
 just
 say
 to


yourself,
 I
 want
 to
 grow
 up
 and
 be
 a


hunter?


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Well,
 no,
 because
 I
 just
 was
 I


never
 thought
 I
 never
 thought
 about
 it.


I
 I
 never
 stopped
 for
 a
 minute
 and
 then


restarted.


you
 just
 were
 100.


>> It
 just
 like
 it
 was
 never
 like
 I
 want
 to


get
 into
 this.
 It
 was
 just
 that
 was
 just


the
 main
 thing.
 Always
 the
 main
 thing.


>> Was
 it
 like
 the
 most
 romantic
 thing
 a


kid
 could
 possibly
 be
 doing?
 I
 mean,


you've
 explained
 that
 it's
 just
 kind
 of


a
 default
 fact
 [snorts]
 of
 life
 for
 you,


>> but
 it
 sounds
 like
 it
 even
 at
 a
 young


age
 is
 bringing
 you
 tremendous
 pleasure.


>> Yeah.
 Identity
 became
 like
 an
 identity.


And
 then
 I
 fell
 and
 the
 thing
 too
 is


through
 that
 I
 I
 fell
 in
 love
 with
 the


history
 of
 it.


>> And
 how
 did
 you
 know
 the
 history
 of
 it?


Like
 you're
 reading


>> that's
 what
 I
 got
 into
 like
 I
 would
 just


I
 would
 read
 that's
 what
 I
 would
 read.


That's
 the
 main
 thing
 I
 would
 read.


>> What
 was
 the
 seminal
 childhood
 book
 of


hunting?


>> Trap
 lines
 north.
 I
 would
 check
 it
 out


at
 the
 library
 and
 then
 I'd
 recheck
 it


out
 and
 I'd
 recheck
 it
 out.
 If
 you
 went


to
 that
 book
 now
 and
 found
 that
 in
 the


Twin
 Lake
 Library,
 it
 dude
 if
 you
 went


it'd
 be
 just
 my
 name
 again
 and
 again


like
 on
 that
 book.


>> Just
 what's
 what
 stands
 out
 from
 that


book.
 was
 like


>> and
 just
 just
 briefly
 describe
 it.


>> Okay.
 I
 again
 all
 that
 hunting
 and
 stuff


what
 I
 wanted
 to
 do
 was
 I
 wanted
 to
 like


hunt
 and
 trap
 for
 a
 living.
 So
 like
 you


know
 people
 know
 all
 these
 names.
 Daniel


Boone
 for
 instance
 like


>> people
 think
 of
 Boone
 as
 an
 explorer
 a


pioneer
 like
 he
 wouldn't
 have
 thought
 of


himself
 that
 way.
 Boon
 was
 a
 market


hunter.
 Boon
 hunted
 for
 the
 markets.
 He


trapped
 beaver.
 He
 trapped
 otter.
 He
 tra


he
 hunted
 bears
 for
 the
 bear
 grease


market.
 bear
 oil,
 bare
 bacon
 market,


deer
 skin
 trade.
 Like
 that's
 what
 Boon


did.
 Like
 Boon
 did
 that
 for
 a
 living.


All
 the
 things
 he's
 known
 for
 came
 out


of
 the
 fact
 that
 that's
 what
 he
 did
 for


a
 living.
 So
 as
 I
 got
 into
 it,
 I
 would


just
 read
 about
 people
 that
 that's
 what


they
 would
 do.
 And
 that
 would
 generally


force
 you
 backward
 in
 time.
 So
 I
 just


read
 about
 trappers
 and
 I
 read
 about


hunters,
 commercial
 hunters,


professional
 hunters,
 because
 that's


what
 I
 wanted
 to
 be.


So
 my
 understanding
 is
 that
 even
 as


you're
 aspiring
 to
 the
 hunting
 life,


>> you


see
 that
 life
 early
 on
 as
 at
 odds
 with


the
 whole
 idea
 of
 environmentalism.
 Yep.


>> And
 conservation.
 At
 that
 time
 being
 in


high
 school,
 I
 I
 I
 confused
 in
 the


environmental
 movement
 with
 the
 animal


rights
 movement.


>> Of
 course,


>> which
 upset
 you
 because


>> Well,
 it
 upset
 me
 because
 the
 the
 in
 the


animal
 rights
 movement
 was
 at
 that
 time


working
 very
 aggressively


to
 ban
 hunting
 practices
 and
 they
 were


having
 success
 at
 it.


>> You
 thought
 they
 were
 the
 enemy?


>> Yeah,
 100%.


>> Because
 they
 were
 going
 to
 prevent
 you.


>> They
 were
 going
 to
 destroy
 our
 lifestyle


from


>> the
 environmentalists
 were
 going
 to


destroy
 our
 lifestyle.


as
 a
 17-year-old,


right?
 We
 started
 a
 group.


>> You
 started


>> our
 group
 was
 hate
 hunters
 against


teenage
 environmentalists.
 And
 we
 even


like
 won
 the
 can
 drive.


>> Hunters
 against
 teenage


environmentalist.


>> I
 I'll
 show
 you
 the
 shirt.
 I
 still
 have


the
 shirt.
 I
 somehow


um
 because
 you
 couldn't
 Google
 stuff,
 I


guess.
 I
 somehow
 got
 it.
 My
 buddies
 and


I
 got
 it.
 Whatever.
 We
 got
 it
 that
 it


was
 that
 that
 was
 the
 environmental


movement
 was
 the
 animal
 rights
 movement.


We
 conflated
 them.


>> But
 um
 at
 the
 same
 time,
 remember


there's
 this
 big
 woods
 we
 always
 would


hunt.


>> Mhm.


>> They
 were
 going
 to
 go
 in
 and
 log
 this


woods
 and
 these
 guys
 came
 in
 and
 marked


all
 the
 wildlife
 trees
 with
 an
 orange


ring.
 I
 remember
 me
 and
 my
 brother
 Danny


sitting
 there
 matching
 paint.
 Like
 I'm


not
 kidding
 you,
 matching
 paint
 to
 get


that
 color
 and
 then
 putting
 it
 in
 a


sprayer
 and
 going
 out
 and
 marking


shitloads
 of
 extra
 trees.


>> Why?
 cuz
 we
 didn't
 want
 them
 to
 cut
 the


trees
 down,
 but
 we're
 like,
 "We're
 going


to
 save
 the
 trees,
 but
 we
 hate
 envir


[laughter]


idiots."


>> You
 obviously


get
 to
 a
 place
 where
 you
 feel
 that


hunting
 and
 environmentalism,
 hunting


and
 conservationism
 are
 actually
 really


wedded.
 Tell
 me
 that
 story,
 how
 it
 is,


>> how
 you
 go
 from
 a
 kid
 wearing
 the
 hate


t-shirts
 to
 suddenly
 seeing
 that
 hunting


is
 environmentalism,
 which
 is
 ultimately


where
 you
 land.
 So
 what
 is
 it
 that


happens?


>> Probably
 the
 mo
 the
 most
 impactful
 thing


that
 happened
 well
 handful
 of
 things.


The
 buddies
 I
 grew
 up
 around,
 okay,
 guys


that
 would
 have
 laughed
 at
 hate.
 We
 we


kind
 of
 didn't
 know
 what
 you
 could
 do


for
 a
 living.
 So
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 people
 in


my
 circle
 were
 like,
 I'm
 going to
 be
 a


wildlife
 biologist
 because
 then
 you


could
 be
 outside
 or
 I'm
 going
 to
 be
 a


game
 warden.
 So
 they
 start
 going
 into


wildlife
 and
 fisheries
 management.
 And


imagine
 like
 the
 the
 the
 awakening


and
 you
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 start


understanding
 ecology,


>> right?
 And
 and
 then
 and
 then
 like


conservation
 history
 out
 of
 that.
 One
 of


my
 peers
 that
 goes
 into
 wildlife


management
 like
 introduced
 me
 for


instance
 to
 Aldo
 Leopolds
 the
 Sand


County
 almanac
 which
 is
 probably
 which


not
 probably
 which
 is
 the
 most


influential


conservation
 environmental
 text.


>> It's
 kind
 of a
 cornerstone
 of
 the


movement.
 Why
 it's
 the
 most
 influential


is
 because
 it
 was
 written
 for
 rednecks


like
 what
 we
 were.
 It
 was
 written
 by
 a


guy
 who
 knew
 what
 it
 was
 to
 chop
 a
 tree


down,
 who
 knew
 what
 it
 was
 to
 raise
 a


crop,
 who
 knew
 what
 it
 was
 to
 hunt
 deer,


who
 knew
 what
 it
 was
 to
 kill
 something


and
 then
 regret
 killing
 it.
 Like
 he
 was


talking
 to
 his
 people
 and
 he
 was
 saying


there's
 a
 thing.
 It's
 ecology.
 We
 need


to
 know
 about
 it.


>> Like
 it's
 our
 history.
 We're
 no
 one's


going
 to
 save
 this
 but
 us.
 No
 one


understands
 it
 and
 loves
 it
 like
 us.
 So


it
 was
 like


>> so
 he
 assigns
 a
 special
 place
 to
 the


hunter.


>> Yes.


>> This
 role
 of


stewarding
 the
 land.


>> Yeah.
 He
 for
 many
 many
 people
 and
 this


is
 an
 old
 book
 by
 this
 time.


He
 introduces
 this
 idea
 of
 the
 hunter


conservationist.
 And
 he
 introduces
 this


idea
 that's
 like


>> the
 days
 of
 us
 being
 conquerors


and
 destroyers


had
 to
 end,


right?
 It
 had
 to
 end,


>> right?
 Like
 Daniel
 Boone
 is
 known
 and


you
 read
 about
 this
 as
 somebody
 who
 may


not
 have
 meant
 to
 but
 ends
 up
 laying


waste
 to
 entire


>> He
 killed
 what
 he
 loved


>> species.
 He
 killed
 what
 he
 loved
 and
 he


would
 have
 told
 you
 the
 same
 thing.


That's
 why
 he
 always
 had
 to
 go
 more
 and


more
 west.
 He
 had
 to
 go
 more
 and
 more


west
 to
 get
 out
 of
 the
 areas
 that
 him


and
 his
 peers
 had
 decimated.


>> And
 Leopold
 is
 saying
 no.


>> We'd
 always
 had
 in
 this
 country
 like
 you


have
 like
 a
 preservation
 mindset
 as


exemplified
 by
 a
 guy
 named
 John
 Mir.


Like
 John
 Mir
 would
 look
 at
 a
 beautiful


landscape
 and
 he'd
 say
 no
 one
 should


touch
 this.
 You
 can
 look
 at
 it
 for
 a


minute
 but
 don't
 touch
 it.
 Humans
 are


evil.
 Preserve
 it.


Rose,
 the
 Roosevelt,
 El
 Leupold


presented
 a
 conservation
 viewpoint
 that


would
 be
 that
 man


is
 going
 to
 engage
 with
 the
 natural


world.
 We
 are
 going
 to
 be
 part
 of
 the


natural
 world.
 We
 have
 to
 be.


>> Are
 we
 going
 to
 do
 this
 in
 a
 way
 that


strengthens
 the
 integrity
 of
 these


natural
 systems
 where
 we're
 going
 to


interact
 or
 are
 we
 going
 to
 interact
 in


a
 way
 that
 destroys
 these
 systems?
 Elder


Leopold
 was
 speaking
 to
 the
 people
 that


are
 going
 to
 interact
 with
 the
 systems.


He
 he
 introduced
 people
 to
 the
 idea
 of


ecology
 that
 that
 natural
 systems


rely
 on
 all
 of
 their
 parts,
 right?
 He


was
 like,
 "It's
 time
 for
 us
 to
 treat


this
 as
 a
 thing
 we
 love
 or
 else
 we're


going
 to
 lose
 it."
 And
 so
 reading
 that,


it
 was


>> You
 identify
 with
 it


>> 100%,
 man.
 Cuz
 he
 like
 understood
 people


that
 were
 out
 on
 the
 land.
 Like
 reading


this
 book
 hit
 like
 a
 I
 didn't
 even


appreciate
 it
 till
 way
 later
 in
 life


like
 how
 much
 that
 hit
 because
 I


understood
 what
 he
 was
 talking
 about.


And
 then
 I
 read
 many
 books
 of
 people


that
 were
 very
 uneasy
 with
 hunting
 like


Barry
 Lopez
 Artic
 Dreams
 had
 a
 huge


impact
 on
 me.
 Barry
 Lopez
 is
 very
 uneasy


with
 hunting.


>> Why?


>> Obvious.


You're
 taking
 life.
 He's
 like
 a
 Zen


Buddhist.
 Um


>> you're
 taking
 life.


>> That
 brings
 me
 to


what
 you
 become.
 Mhm.


>> At
 this
 stage
 of
 your
 life,
 you're
 in


college,
 right?


>> Mhm.


>> After
 college,


>> you
 get
 an
 MFA.


>> Yeah.


>> And
 you
 start
 writing.


>> You
 start
 writing.


>> But
 then
 I
 knew
 I
 was
 going to
 be
 a


writer,


>> right?
 So,
 you're
 not
 just
 going
 to
 be
 a


hunter.
 You're
 going
 to
 be
 a
 hunter
 who


writes
 about


>> cuz
 tra
 cuz
 I
 was
 going
 to
 be
 a
 trapper.


But
 fur
 prices
 were
 so
 bad
 that
 you
 it


was
 just
 was
 untenable.
 But
 I
 had
 a


knack
 for
 writing.


>> I
 thought
 I
 was
 going
 to
 round
 out
 my


income
 as
 a
 trapper
 by
 writing
 howto


instructional
 trapping
 articles.
 So,


>> it's
 a
 great
 plan.


>> Yeah.
 I
 was
 going
 to
 write
 art
 I
 was


going
 to
 write
 like,
 you
 know,
 late


season
 muskrat
 techniques
 [laughter]


through
 for
 through
 the
 ice.
 Right.


>> Well,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 I
 want
 to


talk
 about


>> that's
 how
 I
 got
 that's
 how
 I
 like
 began


to
 to
 write.
 But
 by
 the
 time
 I
 was


finishing
 college,
 I
 wanted
 to
 be
 like
 a


writer
 writer.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 your


writing
 because


you
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 really
 interesting


writing
 that's
 very
 much
 embodies
 this


lifestyle
 you
 have.
 You
 you
 write
 a
 book


about
 recreating
 this
 famous
 epic
 45


course
 meal
 from
 a
 famous
 French
 chef


using
 ingredients
 that
 you
 have


scavenged


>> out
 in
 the
 world
 including
 of
 course


wild
 game.
 You
 write
 a
 book
 about


buffalo
 and
 then
 you
 write
 what
 I


consider
 to
 be
 your
 manifesto


>> meat
 eater
 and


I
 think
 it's
 beautifully
 written


>> and
 you
 describe
 for
 people
 like
 me
 who


aren't
 of
 and
 from
 the
 hunting
 world


>> Yeah.


>> and
 the
 hunting
 life


>> what
 is
 so
 visceral
 and
 romantic
 and


also
 at
 times


complicated


>> difficult
 about
 hunting.


>> Yeah.
 And
 there's
 a
 passage
 I
 want
 to


read.


>> Let
 me
 read
 it
 to
 you.
 Let's
 hear
 it.


[snorts]


>> Quote,
 "I
 was
 hungry
 in
 the
 wilderness


and
 here
 came
 a
 few
 tons
 worth
 of


caribou
 50
 yards
 out
 and
 closing
 fast.


In
 a
 moment
 like
 that,
 there's
 no
 time


for
 emotional
 doawling.
 It's
 time
 for


unairring
 judgment.
 It
 is
 a
 time
 for


speed,
 both
 mental
 and
 physical.
 It
 is
 a


time
 for
 action
 and
 precision
 and


discipline.
 It
 is
 a
 time
 to
 do
 what


millions
 of
 years
 worth
 of
 evolution


built
 us
 to
 do.
 And
 in
 the
 act
 of
 doing


it,
 you
 experience
 the
 unconfused
 purity


of
 being
 a
 human
 predator,
 stripped
 of


everything
 that
 is
 non-essential.


In
 that
 moment
 of
 impending
 violence
 and


death,
 you
 are
 gifted
 a
 beautiful


glimpse
 of
 life.
 I
 want
 you
 to
 explain


this
 idea
 because
 this
 is
 the
 part
 of


the
 hunting
 life
 that
 I
 think
 those
 of


us
 who
 don't
 hunt
 with
 any
 regularity


>> probably
 struggle
 to
 understand.


>> Yes.


>> Can
 you
 just
 explain
 that?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 I
 have
 had
 the
 the
 the
 good


fortune
 of
 um


taking
 many
 many
 people
 out
 on
 their


first
 hunting
 trip
 where
 they've
 gotten


their
 first
 animal
 almost
 to
 the
 person.


It's
 cathartic.


People
 cry.
 It's
 a
 thing
 that
 happens.


If
 someone
 kills
 their
 first
 deer
 as
 an


adult,
 they
 cry.


No
 regret.


Never
 regret.
 But
 it's
 like
 it's
 like


something
 is
 like
 clicking
 with
 them


about
 cycles
 of
 life
 and
 death.
 I
 never


had
 that
 because
 I
 started
 so
 young.
 I


deliberately
 started
 my
 kids
 very
 young


to
 where
 nothing
 would
 surprise
 them.
 I


later
 thought
 about
 that
 more
 when
 I
 had


a
 chance
 now
 and
 then
 to
 hunt
 out
 with


like
 indigenous
 hunters
 and
 gatherers
 in


other
 parts
 of
 the
 world.
 You
 know


what's
 absent


like
 in
 their
 hunting
 practices?
 Remorse


absent.


>> And
 these
 are
 people
 who
 for
 generations


have
 hunted
 and
 fished
 for
 their
 living.


There
 is
 like
 it
 is
 joy
 and
 it
 is
 a
 lack


of
 remorse.
 You
 feel
 honor
 but
 like
 no


remorse.
 It
 is
 taking
 life
 to
 them
 is


life.


>> It
 just
 is.
 It's
 like
 I
 continue
 on.


>> Is
 that
 the
 life
 you're
 describing
 when


you
 say
 you're
 gifted
 a
 glimpse
 of
 life?


>> Yeah.
 It's
 like
 that's
 how
 you
 stay


alive.
 Like
 that
 is
 that's
 the


difference.
 And
 for
 like
 ancestral


humans,
 for
 wildlife,
 there's
 like
 death


is
 you
 not
 killing.


>> Death
 is
 you
 not
 killing.


>> Yeah.
 Cuz
 you
 starve,
 right?
 Not
 me
 now,


but
 I'm
 just
 talking
 about
 like
 why
 do


you
 not
 see
 signs
 of
 remorse
 or


compassion
 in
 wildlife?
 Why
 do
 you
 not


see
 signs
 of
 remorse
 or
 regret
 with


indigenous
 hunter
 gatherers?
 Because


they've
 they've
 always
 seen
 with


incredible
 clarity


that
 that
 taking
 of
 life,
 that
 killing


gives
 life


>> gives
 life
 to
 them
 and
 their
 families.


That
 relates
 to
 something
 else
 you
 write


in
 this
 book
 I
 consider
 to
 be
 your
 your


manifesto.


Why
 do
 you
 think


so
 many
 people


feel
 so
 disconnected
 from
 this
 thing


that's
 so
 visceral
 for
 you?
 Do
 you
 think


it's
 just
 as
 simple


>> as
 the
 fact
 that


>> we
 now
 all
 rely
 on
 vast
 industrial,


>> you
 know,
 slaughterhouse
 operations
 to


get
 our
 food
 because
 we
 all
 go
 into


grocery
 stores
 and


>> Yeah.
 you
 know,
 buy
 our
 food.
 You
 wrote


you
 write
 about
 this.
 You
 you
 say
 people


have
 no
 problem


>> eating
 their
 food.
 That
 proxy


executioners.
 I'll
 never
 forget
 that


phrase.


>> Hypocrisy
 K.
 Like
 the
 thing
 I
 always


think
 about
 if
 I'm
 weighing
 the
 morality


of
 this
 or
 if
 I'm
 if
 I'm
 like
 analyzing


my
 world
 and
 analyzing
 my
 food,
 it's


like
 you
 ask
 yourself
 a
 simple
 question.


as
 much
 as
 is
 possible.
 Put
 yourself
 in


the
 shoes
 of
 an
 of
 an
 animal
 that
 will


ultimately
 be
 consumed
 by
 a
 human.
 Would


you
 rather
 jump
 into
 and
 live
 the
 life


of
 something
 born
 on
 a
 slab
 of
 concrete


>> and
 like
 fed
 every
 day
 and
 optimized?


Yeah.


>> And
 like
 your
 your
 inputs
 are
 optimized


for
 your
 outputs
 and
 it's
 like
 a
 done


deal.
 When
 you
 hit
 1,100
 lb,
 you're


dead,
 right?


Or
 imagine
 the
 life
 of
 a
 thing
 that
 is


unaware


like
 unaware
 and
 then
 one
 day
 just
 pow


lights
 out
 in
 the
 woods.
 Man,
 that
 wild


life
 for
 me
 as
 a
 human
 trying
 to


understand
 it
 like
 that
 wild
 life
 is


more
 beautiful
 and
 that
 wild
 life
 is


better.
 What
 you're
 saying
 is
 there's


virtue
 in
 consuming
 an
 animal
 that
 has


lived
 a
 rich
 and
 full
 and
 varied


life
 on
 their
 own
 terms.


>> I
 believe
 so.
 There
 is
 a
 tremendous


beauty
 in
 wildlife
 living
 in
 wild


places.
 We
 culturally
 honor
 it.
 We
 build


vacations
 around
 going
 to
 look
 at
 it.
 So


when
 you're
 eating
 a
 thing
 that
 lived


that
 life
 that
 lived
 that
 like
 beautiful


wild
 free
 life,
 it's
 just
 better.
 It's


just
 different,


>> right?
 It's
 the
 ultimate
 freerange
 food.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 like
 nothing
 to
 regret
 here,


man.
 It
 was
 a
 It's
 a
 beautiful
 place.


It's
 a
 beautiful
 animal.
 It
 lived
 a


beautiful
 life
 and
 now
 it's
 supporting


us
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 support
 its


environment
 so
 it
 can
 make
 more.
 It's


just
 it's
 tidy.


In
 writing
 about
 hunting,
 you
 you


deliver
 an
 interesting
 and
 pretty
 stark


judgment
 of
 those
 who
 would
 judge


hunters
 like
 you.
 You
 write


to
 abhore
 hunting
 is
 to


>> to
 hate
 something
 about
 yourself.


>> You
 write
 to
 abhore
 hunting
 is
 to
 hate


the
 place
 of
 which
 you
 came,
 which
 is


akin
 to
 hating
 yourself
 in
 some
 distant


abstract
 way.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 human
 history
 on
 our
 continent


goes
 back
 somewhere
 around
 20,000
 years.


Those
 people
 were
 all
 hunters.
 They


hunted
 for
 a
 living.
 They
 were
 hunters.


Here
 on
 this
 continent,
 that
 only
 ended


a
 couple
 hundred
 years
 ago.
 That's


what's
 always
 had
 hap.
 That's
 how
 people


in
 what
 is
 now
 North
 America
 survived.


They
 hunted.
 If
 they
 didn't
 hunt,
 they


died.
 They
 were
 hunters.
 No
 matter
 how


you
 define,
 like
 if
 you
 brought
 someone


from
 outer
 space
 and
 they
 could
 come


down
 and
 sort
 of
 get
 offer
 you
 like
 a


little
 bit
 of
 an
 analysis
 of
 hunters
 and


they
 were
 to
 look
 at
 the
 the
 scope
 of


human
 history
 and
 you're
 say,
 "Hey,


explain
 humans
 to
 me."
 The
 the
 out
 of


space
 person
 would
 look
 and
 be
 like,


"Uh,
 man,
 they're
 mostly
 hunters."
 Well,


not
 lately,
 [laughter]


right?
 That's
 what
 that's
 like
 what
 we


did.
 So,
 how
 is
 it
 how
 could
 it
 be
 that


we've
 like
 shed
 all
 that?
 We
 haven't


shed
 all
 that.
 So
 when
 I
 say
 that


someone
 like
 abhores
 the
 practice,
 it's


like,
 dude,


look
 at
 yourself.
 Where
 are
 your
 eyes?


They're
 centered
 on
 your
 head.
 So
 you


have
 really
 good
 depth
 perception.
 Why


do
 you
 have
 K-9
 teeth?


>> It's
 like
 you're
 not
 that
 far
 away
 from


this.


>> But
 the
 abhoring,


>> that's
 real
 what
 you're
 identifying


here.
 There's
 there's
 a
 cultural
 chasm,


right,


>> between
 the
 way
 you
 grew
 up


>> and
 the
 way
 so
 many
 of
 us
 now
 see


ourselves
 and
 how
 we
 see
 our


relationship
 to
 food.
 And


>> why
 is
 it
 the
 case
 that


>> this
 thing
 that
 is
 so
 essential
 to
 you


and
 that
 is
 at
 the
 heart
 of
 how
 you


identify
 yourself


has
 become
 so
 rare?


>> I
 could
 I
 could
 answer
 that
 in
 10
 ways.


Let
 me
 hit
 you
 with
 one.
 Sure.
 Just
 to


consider.
 If
 every
 American


tomorrow
 went
 out
 and
 killed
 a
 deer,


>> it'd
 be
 a
 real
 problem.


>> We'd
 have
 a
 200
 million
 deer
 deficit.


So,
 it
 just
 became


um
 besides


human
 will,
 besides
 what
 we
 want
 to
 do,


it
 became
 impossible.
 It
 became


impossible.
 It
 had
 to
 be
 like
 if
 you


look
 at
 it
 like
 ecologically,
 it
 had
 to


be
 as
 the
 population
 exploded
 and
 as
 we


destroyed
 all
 of
 our
 landscape
 or
 much


of
 our
 landscape,
 it
 had
 to
 be
 that
 we


quit.
 That
 was
 the
 whole
 point
 of
 the


agricultural
 revolutions
 allows
 people


to
 live
 close
 together.
 There
 was
 a


reason
 why
 in
 like
 in
 Native
 America,


the
 land
 had
 a
 carrying
 capacity.


Human
 populations
 in
 in
 like
 historic


North
 America
 were
 the
 size
 they
 were


because
 that's
 how
 much
 you
 could
 fit


there.
 Mhm.


>> That's
 how
 much
 you
 could
 extract
 from


wildlife
 resources.
 And
 then
 we
 discover


other
 ways.
 And
 so
 you
 can't
 anymore.


You
 can't
 anymore.
 And
 even
 like
 a
 thing


I've
 always
 felt
 was
 everybody
 can't
 do


it.
 But
 I
 wanted
 everyone
 to
 understand


it.


>> So
 like
 many
 people
 in
 this
 world,
 you


simply
 want
 to
 be
 understood.


>> Yeah.
 I
 want
 to
 be
 understood.
 And
 also


you
 want
 people
 to
 recognize,
 this
 is


the
 thing
 we
 haven't
 touched
 on
 yet.
 As


I
 learned
 conservation
 history
 and
 I


learned
 the
 role,
 the
 outsized
 role


of
 hunters
 [snorts]


in
 the
 conservation
 story,


I
 also
 felt
 like
 we
 deserve
 more
 credit


than
 we
 get.


>> Right?
 And
 I
 was
 like,
 you
 should
 thank


me
 now
 that
 I
 know
 what
 I
 know
 and
 you


don't
 know.
 I
 know
 that
 you
 owe
 me
 a


thanks.
 you
 owe
 me
 a
 debt
 of
 gratitude


because
 by
 buying
 my
 hunting
 licenses


and
 participating
 in
 the
 things
 I


participated
 in
 like
 we
 saved
 American


wildlife,


>> right?
 Cuz
 I
 didn't
 really
 know
 this
 or


understand
 [snorts]
 it
 very
 well
 until
 I


read
 your
 book
 and
 read
 many
 of
 your


writings,
 although
 I
 should
 have
 known


this
 that
 hunting
 licenses
 contribute


directly
 to
 the
 funding
 for
 American


conservation.


>> Yeah.


>> Steve,
 you've
 written
 many,
 many
 poetic


passages
 about
 the
 act
 of
 hunting.
 Mhm.


>> And
 [snorts]
 I
 want
 to,
 as
 we
 wrap
 up


our
 conversation,


return
 to
 one
 of
 those
 writings.
 And
 if


you
 don't
 mind,


>> I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 you
 to
 read
 this.


>> Oh,
 wow.


>> You
 got
 a
 great
 reading
 voice.


>> I've
 learned
 to
 see
 the
 earth
 as
 a
 thing


that
 breathes
 and
 ws
 and
 brings
 forth


life.


I
 see
 these
 revelations
 as
 a
 form
 of


grace
 and
 art,
 as
 beautiful
 as
 the


things
 we
 humans
 attempt
 to
 capture


through
 music,
 dance,
 and
 poetry.
 And
 as


I've
 become
 aware
 of
 this,
 it
 has
 become


increasingly
 difficult
 for
 me
 to
 see


hunting
 as
 alltogether
 outside
 of


civilization.


Maybe
 stalking
 the
 woods
 is
 as
 vital
 to


the
 human
 condition
 as
 playing
 music
 or


putting
 words
 to
 paper.
 Maybe
 hunting


has
 as
 much
 of
 a
 claim
 on
 our
 civilized


selves
 as
 anything
 else.


>> It's
 really
 beautiful.


>> Oh,
 thank
 you.


>> It
 makes
 me
 want
 to
 go
 hunting
 with
 you.


>> Oh,
 really?


>> Yes.
 Well,
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about
 this


tomorrow
 morning
 very
 early.


You
 are
 taking
 me
 and
 my
 colleagues
 out


hunting.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 just
 to
 explain
 because
 this


episode's
 going
 to
 be
 running
 on


Thanksgiving.


>> We're
 not
 going
 to
 be
 hunting
 turkeys.


>> No.


>> You
 were
 very
 clear
 about
 that.
 You
 can


hunt
 turkeys
 here
 in
 the
 fall,
 but
 but


[snorts]
 we
 hunt
 them
 in
 the
 spring.


>> Mhm.


>> It's
 just
 like
 almost
 like
 culturally
 in


the
 spring
 during
 their
 breeding
 season,


we
 hunt
 just
 the
 males
 and
 you
 hunt
 the


males
 when
 the
 males
 are
 out
 gobbling


and
 you
 can
 call
 them
 in
 and
 just
 very


selective.
 Just
 get
 the
 males.
 In
 the


fall,
 guys
 will
 hunt
 you
 can
 hunt
 them,


but
 you
 you
 you
 risk
 killing
 the


females.
 I
 I
 don't
 like
 I
 I've


never
 killed
 a
 turkey
 in
 the
 fall.
 I've


killed
 many
 many
 turkeys
 in
 the
 spring.


I
 don't
 hunt
 them
 in
 the
 fall.
 So,


[snorts]
 uh
 what's
 also
 fun
 I
 love
 this


little
 fact.
 The
 pilgrims,


they're
 probably
 eating
 fowl
 water
 fowl


migratory
 waterfall.
 100%
 deer


probably
 seafood
 most
 certainly
 geese.


If
 you
 look
 at
 all
 if
 you
 look
 at
 all


the
 journals
 and
 stuff,
 they
 were
 eating


migratory
 waterfall.
 [music]


So,
 we're
 we're
 hunting
 duck.


>> Yeah,
 you
 will
 see
 ducks
 for
 sure.
 Mhm.


>> And
 you
 will
 eat
 [music]
 ducks.


>> I
 promise.


>> We'll
 eat
 them
 together.


>> H.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 we'll
 [music]
 see
 you


at
 dawn.
 Till
 then,
 thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Appreciate
 it.
 [music]


[music]


Oh
 yeah.


>> Wait,
 you
 guys
 got
 coffee
 already?


>> Room.


>> Oh,
 the
 room
 coffee.


>> Yep,
 there
 he
 is.


>> Oh,
 man.
 Is
 it
 nice
 out?


Prepare
 for
 the
 worst.
 Embrace
 the
 50°
 5


a.m.
 weather.
 The
 next
 morning,
 Steve


picks
 us
 up
 in
 his
 very
 large
 pickup


truck.


>> You
 are
 the
 picture
 of
 promptness


>> to
 drive
 us
 out
 to
 the
 duck
 hunting


spot.


>> Unseasonably
 warm
 and
 windy.


>> Only
 question
 is,
 will
 the
 ducks
 notice?


>> They
 might
 get
 down
 to
 an
 area
 like
 this


and
 the
 weather
 is
 suitable


and
 then
 they'll
 just
 hang.


>> So,
 doesn't
 it
 seem
 like
 duck
 hang


weather?


>> Yeah,
 very
 duck
 hanging
 weather.


>> Why
 would
 you
 flee
 this
 weather?
 Yeah.


He's
 like,
 "Dude,
 you
 should
 go
 back


north.
 It's
 too
 hot."


>> Okay.
 So,
 can
 you
 just
 just
 explain


where
 we're
 going?
 You
 picked
 us
 up
 at


our
 hotel
 in
 downtown
 Bosezeman.


>> Yep.


>> I
 have
 a
 buddy.
 There's
 a
 property
 over


here
 owned
 by
 a
 guy
 named
 Mark
 Beers.


>> Okay.


>> He's
 a
 friend
 of
 mine.
 He's
 a
 big


wetlands
 duck
 conservation


guy.
 That's
 his
 thing.


the
 way
 he
 like
 you
 know
 they
 run
 cattle


out
 there
 at
 a
 farm
 out
 there
 but
 he
 is


like
 his
 manage
 his
 land
 management
 is


wildlife
 first
 ducks
 first


>> why
 did
 you
 want
 us
 to
 be
 hunting
 at


this
 hour
 cuz
 it's
 5:20
 in
 the
 morning
 I


mean


>> so
 there's
 the
 main
 movement
 that
 ducks


will
 make
 like
 all
 day
 the
 big
 movement


that
 ducks
 will
 make
 is
 at
 daybreak


sometime
 in
 the
 morning


>> in
 the
 cold
 gray
 light
 of
 dawn
 on


to
 quote
 Robert
 O'Kee
 Jr.
 They
 like
 they


they
 like
 to
 float.
 They
 like
 to
 fly


then.
 So
 that's
 why
 you
 want
 to
 be
 out


there.
 And
 the
 other
 thing
 is
 it's
 just


like
 there's
 like
 a
 tradition
 component.


Like
 even
 if
 someone
 said
 if
 they're


like,
 man,
 they're
 not
 really
 going
 to


fly
 till
 9:00
 a.m.


>> Right.


>> You
 just
 kind
 of
 would
 feel
 like
 uh


>> lazy
 bones.


>> Yeah.
 You'd
 feel
 like
 a
 real
 loser.
 It's


just
 like
 like
 I
 like
 hunting
 turkeys


almost
 more
 than
 anything.


And
 we
 kill
 a
 lot
 of
 turkeys
 between


10:00
 and
 noon,
 but
 it's
 a
 sin
 to
 not
 be


out
 there
 at
 daybreak.


[music]


And
 I
 suppose
 this
 is
 old
 hat
 for
 you,


but
 is
 this
 drive
 and
 the
 whole
 getting


there
 process
 still
 filled
 with
 a
 lot
 of


excitement
 for
 you
 every
 time
 you
 hunt?


>> Oh,
 yeah.
 No,
 it
 it's
 always
 it's
 um


yeah,
 there's
 always
 an
 anticipation
 of


what's
 going
 to
 happen
 or
 there's
 always


like
 an
 element
 of
 mystery.


It's
 like
 asking
 a
 it's
 like
 asking
 a


question,


you
 know.
 One
 time
 I
 was
 writing


something
 about
 fishing.
 I
 was
 saying


like
 every
 cast
 is
 like
 you're
 asking
 a


question,
 you
 know,
 waiting
 for
 the


answer.
 So,
 um


>> All
 right.
 So,
 we're
 now
 off
 the
 main


road.


>> Yep.
 And
 we're
 we're
 kind
 of
 out
 in
 an


agricultural
 area
 and
 this
 is
 ground
 out


here
 that
 won't
 get
 developed
 ever.


>> So
 we're
 just
 pulling
 out
 into
 the
 tall


grass
 here.


>> Yeah.
 And
 like
 and
 there's
 crop
 fields


all
 around
 us,
 but
 we're
 kind
 of
 down
 in


the
 we're
 down
 in
 the
 channels
 of
 water


>> at
 this
 point.
 We're
 about
 25
 minutes


outside
 of
 Bosezeman
 and
 it's
 so
 dark
 we


can
 honestly
 be
 anywhere.


>> It's
 quite
 beautiful
 just
 to
 see
 this


all
 on
 the
 car
 lights.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it's
 fun
 when
 you
 go
 somewhere


new
 or
 you
 don't
 know
 where
 you're
 at
 in


the
 dark
 and
 as
 it
 gets
 light
 out
 you


get
 to
 be
 like,
 "Oh,


>> I'm
 completely
 disoriented."


>> We
 pull
 into
 what
 looks
 like
 a
 grassy


meadow.
 And
 we
 all
 get
 out
 and
 then
 we


meet
 Max
 Barta.


>> Steve,
 how's
 it
 going?


>> Good.
 Good.
 Good.


>> This
 is
 Max.
 Did
 you
 meet
 everybody?


>> Max
 works
 with
 Steve
 on
 his
 TV
 show
 as
 a


videographer.
 But
 he's
 here
 this
 morning


because
 he's
 a
 very
 good
 duck
 hunter
 who


brought
 all
 his
 gear
 with
 him
 along
 with


a
 very
 important
 member
 of
 our
 hunting


party.
 His
 dog
 Ruby.


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 Ruby.


>> Hey,
 you're
 fine.


>> And
 then
 suddenly
 it's
 very
 busy.
 Max


and
 Steve
 are
 unloading
 a
 ton
 of
 stuff


from
 their
 trucks.


>> Are
 you
 going
 to
 wear
 your
 Steve?


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 fine.


>> Okay.


>> If
 you
 want
 to
 get
 real
 serious,
 I'll


give
 you
 a
 big
 headlamp.
 I
 mean,
 wow.


Look
 at
 this
 thing.
 It's
 like
 a
 brass


lamp
 affixed
 to
 a
 hunting
 cap.


>> It's
 called
 raccoon
 light.


>> And
 of
 course,
 they're
 gathering
 their


guns
 and
 their
 ammo.


>> This
 is
 your
 rifle.


>> Well,
 it's
 shotgun.
 Can't
 hunt
 ducks


with
 a
 rifle.


>> Now,
 just
 to
 be
 clear,
 I
 am
 here


observing.
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 be
 shooting


a
 gun
 today.
 [music]


>> And
 then
 even
 like
 all
 all
 this
 stuff
 is


regulated.
 So,
 this
 is
 called
 a
 12
 gauge


shotgun.
 When
 hunting
 migratory


waterfall,
 you
 have
 to
 put
 a
 thing
 in


here
 called
 a
 plug
 that
 prevents
 you


from
 putting
 more
 than
 two
 shells
 in
 the


magazine.


>> So,
 this
 is
 a
 pile
 of
 plastic
 decoy


ducks.
 Yeah,


>> there
 are
 a
 shocking
 number
 of
 duck


decoys
 and
 goose
 decoys.
 Use
 them
 to


fool
 real
 ducks,
 which
 is
 kind
 of
 crazy


to
 me.
 I
 always
 make
 the
 joke
 whenever


like
 the
 ducks
 don't
 come
 in
 um
 I
 always


say,
 "Well,
 yeah,
 we
 got
 a
 pile
 of


plastic
 out
 there
 and
 poor
 human
 beings


trying
 to
 hide
 themselves,
 you
 know,


like
 no
 wonder
 they're
 not
 coming
 in."


[music]


>> They're
 like,
 "That
 don't
 look
 good."


>> Nope.
 So,


>> and
 pretty
 soon
 we're
 all
 walking
 out


into
 the
 grassy
 darkness.


>> Do
 you
 want
 one
 of
 us
 to
 carry
 this


around?


>> Yeah.
 You
 can
 just
 grab
 them
 by
 the


handles.
 Yep.
 Got
 one
 like
 that.
 Morning


weight.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 we're
 setting
 up
 for
 the


water.


>> How
 deep
 is
 it?
 It's
 like
 just
 below
 my


knees
 here.


>> So,
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 we're
 putting


decoys
 here
 to
 show
 that
 there's
 ducks


congregating
 here.


>> But
 then,
 but
 then
 the
 main
 pocket
 you


want
 them
 to
 be
 in
 is
 right
 there.
 And


that
 puts
 them
 more
 out
 in
 front
 of
 you.


>> So,
 basically
 right
 here
 in
 this
 now
 in


this
 vacuum
 is
 where
 you
 hope
 the
 duck


is
 going
 to
 come
 later.


>> Yeah.
 like
 kind
 of
 a
 good
 landing
 area


right
 where
 you
 just
 cross
 that
 rock.


>> Yeah,
 right
 right
 across
 that
 rock.


>> I
 got
 it.


>> So,


>> it's
 kind
 of
 cool
 to
 now
 see
 them
 spread


about.


Suddenly
 looks
 like
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


ducks
 in
 this
 pond
 even
 though
 they're


fake.


>> Yeah.


>> See,
 can
 you
 just
 describe
 this
 uh


structure
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 going


into?


>> Yep.
 This
 is
 a
 very
 nice
 hunting
 blind.


Um,


>> it's
 a
 it's
 like
 a
 it's
 like
 a
 very


elaborately
 camouflaged
 shoe
 box.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 got
 a
 bench
 to
 sit
 in.
 It's


got
 a
 little
 gun
 rack
 and
 then
 it's


[ __ ]
 just
 like
 a
 Yeah,
 a
 shoe
 box
 big


enough
 to
 hold
 seven
 people
 or
 ideally


five
 people
 packed
 very
 tightly.


>> We're
 challenging
 the
 space,


>> but
 it's
 big.
 mainly
 it
 provides
 a


structure
 that
 you
 can
 affix
 all
 this


vegetation
 to.


>> Yeah.
 And
 it
 is
 like
 thoroughly
 layered


with


>> hay
 brush.


>> It's
 meant
 to
 blend
 in.
 Yeah.


>> If
 you
 didn't
 know
 it
 was
 here,
 it


wouldn't
 be
 here.


>> Ducks
 can
 see
 color.
 They're
 they
 can
 be


very
 hard
 to
 trick.
 And
 so
 this
 just


allows
 you
 to
 stay
 concealed.


>> That's
 a
 dog
 box.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that's
 going
 to
 make
 you


entirely


>> That's
 for
 his
 dog.
 that
 can't


>> that's
 your
 dog
 is
 terrified.


>> Yeah,
 she
 loves
 it.
 Like
 it's
 crazy.
 If


I
 don't
 bring
 her,
 she
 is
 so
 teed
 off
 at


me.
 Just
 like
 So
 we
 pile
 into
 this
 duck


blind.
 You
 mind
 if
 I
 go
 in?


>> No.
 No.


>> I'll
 be
 down
 on
 this.


>> Steve
 plants
 himself
 at
 the
 far
 end
 of


the
 blind
 and
 Max
 is
 at
 the
 other
 end.


>> So
 you're


>> What's
 that?


>> See
 that's
 loaded
 now.


>> Mhm.
 Yeah,
 this
 is
 the
 safe.


>> Do
 we
 have
 everybody
 within
 earshot?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 so.


>> Because
 you're
 not
 shooting,
 there's
 not


a
 lot
 to
 know
 about,
 but
 I
 really
 can't


think
 of
 any
 way
 you'd
 get
 shot.
 Uh,


don't


>> don't
 get
 shot.


>> Yeah,
 don't
 stand
 up
 unexpectedly.
 You


don't
 have
 shotguns,
 so
 you
 can't
 really


do
 any
 damage.
 Yeah,
 never
 mind.
 I
 can't


picture
 a
 world
 in
 which
 you'd
 get
 hurt.


Don't
 jump
 out
 of
 the
 blind,
 but
 you


can't
 because
 Max
 is
 on
 the
 end.
 There's


nothing
 to
 do.


>> [music]


>> And
 after
 all
 the
 work
 of
 placing
 the


decoys
 and
 getting
 the
 dog
 into
 the
 dog


blind
 and
 all
 of
 us
 humans
 and
 our
 gear


into
 the
 duck
 blind,
 there's
 nothing
 to


do
 but
 wait.
 So,
 it's
 now
 about
 6:30


a.m.
 and
 first
 light
 is
 emerging
 and
 the


silhouettes
 of
 the
 mountains


now
 appear
 with
 the
 sun
 behind
 them.


Oh,
 and
 that's
 our
 first
 actual
 real


bird
 sighting
 just
 flew
 right
 over
 us.
 I


think
 that
 was
 a
 goose.


Wait,
 what
 was
 that?


Oh,
 that
 was
 me
 blowing
 my
 call.
 Duck.


That's
 your
 duck
 call.


>> Max
 has
 with
 him
 a
 variety
 of
 duck


calls.
 These
 little
 wind
 instruments


that
 are
 hanging
 around
 his
 neck.


>> Do
 you
 see
 that
 duck
 swimming
 there?


Yeah,
 that's
 a
 Drake
 Mal.
 He
 blows
 them


occasionally
 to
 attract
 the
 birds.


>> He's
 the
 one
 that's
 making
 this
 noise


right
 now.


>> And
 he's
 really,
 really
 good
 at
 it.


>> Hey,
 Max,
 what
 was
 legal
 light?


>> 42.


>> Oh,
 we
 got
 two
 minutes.


>> Now
 that
 we're
 settled,
 Steve
 and
 Max


become
 very
 conscious
 of
 the
 time.


>> You
 can
 legally
 hunt
 ducks
 30
 minutes


before
 legal
 sunrise.


There's
 a
 dog.


That's
 great.


>> And
 Max
 lets
 Steve
 know
 officially


>> good
 to
 go.


>> Yep.


>> That
 they're
 good
 to
 go.


>> Here
 comes
 some
 ducks
 right
 here.


>> And


Steve
 shoots
 a
 bird.


>> Right
 out
 of
 the
 sky.
 It
 all
 happens
 so


fast.


You
 just
 shot
 and
 killed
 the
 very
 first


duck
 you
 saw
 of
 the
 morning.


>> No,
 no,
 we
 saw
 a
 lot
 of
 ducks
 this


morning.


>> No,
 you
 just


>> That
 was
 the
 first
 duck
 at
 legal
 light


>> and
 you
 hit
 it.


>> Um,
 yep,
 we
 hit
 one.


The
 dog
 returns
 to
 the
 blind
 with
 the


duck
 in
 its
 mouth.


>> That's
 the
 most
 efficient
 thing
 I've


ever
 seen.


>> Ruby
 kennel.


>> Max
 tucks
 the
 duck
 onto
 a
 little
 shelf


in
 front
 of
 us.
 And
 right
 away,
 Steve


starts
 to
 spot
 more
 and
 more
 birds


flying
 overhead.


>> Look
 at
 all
 those
 ducks.
 What
 are
 those?


>> And
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 morning
 proceeds


just
 like
 that.
 There
 are
 these
 very


long
 periods
 of
 silence,


some
 hits


and


>> uhhuh


>> some
 misses.


>> Know,
 you
 know
 those
 people
 that
 make


those
 rugs
 and
 they
 put
 an
 imperfection


in
 there
 so
 that
 it's
 not
 insulting
 to


God,
 you
 know,


>> like
 Max
 has
 this
 little
 thing
 where


he'll
 do
 a
 miss
 now
 and
 then.


>> What
 was
 that?


>> You
 making
 fun
 of
 me
 cuz
 I
 missed.


>> No,
 he's
 calling
 you
 godlike.
 Oh,


>> and
 we're
 just
 kind
 of
 hanging
 out


together.
 Well,
 no.
 He
 doesn't
 want
 to


seem
 pompous
 to
 God
 in
 the
 eyes
 of
 God.


So,
 he
 misses
 nothing.


>> Inside
 this
 incredibly
 tiny
 duck
 blind


>> in
 the
 middle
 of
 this
 gorgeous
 grassy


wetland.


>> As
 they
 better
 understand
 bird
 vision,


there's
 this
 idea
 that
 iridesence


is
 like
 glowing
 neon.
 that
 this
 in
 their


vision
 is
 like,
 [snorts]


you
 [laughter]
 know,
 like
 very
 they're


very
 tuned
 into
 that
 iridescence.


>> And
 I
 start
 to
 feel
 this
 camaraderie.


We're
 all
 now
 in
 league
 together.


>> And
 then
 every
 so
 often,
 Max
 and
 Steve


become
 extremely
 focused
 once
 again
 on


the
 sky.


Everyone
 gets
 serious.


>> Right
 side,
 right
 side,
 right
 side.


And
 then


another
 duck
 is
 down.


>> Good
 girl.


>> Max
 returns
 to
 the
 blind
 with
 the
 bird


>> and
 he
 holds
 it
 out
 to
 me.


>> Yeah,
 Michael.
 Wow.
 Grab
 it.
 He's
 very


pretty.
 Yeah,
 you
 can
 just
 grab
 him
 like


this.
 Grab
 him.
 He's
 a
 little
 wet,
 but


>> Wow.
 I've
 never
 held
 a
 a
 duck
 in
 my


hands
 before.
 Living
 or
 dead?


>> Wow.


>> He's
 got
 so
 many
 different
 colors
 on


him,
 too.
 Like


>> he's
 It's
 still
 warm.
 Yeah.
 [music]


I'm
 holding
 this
 still
 warm
 duck
 with


his


beautiful
 feathers.
 Dark
 green,
 dark


blue.
 It's
 kind
 of
 white
 fringed
 [music]


at
 the
 edges.


Steve,


I'm
 I'm
 feeling
 the
 things
 [music]
 now.


>> What
 are
 you
 feeling?


>> I'm
 feeling
 all
 the
 things.


>> Oh,
 really?


>> I
 mean,


>> you
 feel
 something.


>> This
 creature
 in
 my
 hands
 that
 was
 alive


10
 seconds
 ago
 and
 is
 now
 [music]
 still


warm.
 And


I'm
 feeling
 I'm
 feeling
 all
 the
 feelings


that
 you
 you
 write
 about.
 It's
 like
 it's


beautiful.
 It's
 sad.
 It's


[laughter]


>> Do
 you
 feel
 uh
 like
 regret?


>> Do
 I
 feel
 regret?


>> Like
 you
 are
 you
 like,
 "Man,
 we


shouldn't
 have
 done
 that."


>> No,
 that's
 not
 that's
 not
 the
 first
 duck


swarming
 us.


>> That's
 not
 the
 feeling
 I
 have.


I
 just
 feel
 connected
 to
 this
 thing.


That's
 what
 I
 feel.
 I
 feel
 connected
 to


it
 in
 a
 way
 that's
 kind
 of
 hard
 to


explain.


>> Like
 my
 daughter,
 she'll
 want
 to
 lay


them
 a
 certain
 way.
 She
 kind
 of
 smooths


them
 out.
 Wow.


[music]


I
 feel
 like
 this
 is
 changing
 my


relationship
 to
 the
 sky.
 Just
 like


>> I'm
 just
 like
 scanning
 the
 sky
 looking


for
 any
 sign
 of
 wings


cuz
 they
 come
 so
 quickly.


By
 9:00
 a.m.,
 there
 is
 a
 row
 of
 eight


birds
 lined
 up
 inside
 this
 duck
 blind.


>> Can
 I
 stand
 up,
 Steve?


>> Yeah,
 we're
 done.


>> And
 Steve
 calls
 it.
 We're
 done.


>> So,
 that's
 it.


>> Yep.


>> We're
 done.
 Eight
 ducks.
 2
 hours.


>> Is
 that
 what
 it
 was?


>> Yeah.


>> After
 the
 break,
 our
 hunting
 expedition


concludes
 in
 Steve's
 kitchen.
 [music]


>> [music]


>> Okay,
 so
 we're
 on
 our
 way
 to
 Steve's


where
 the
 ducks
 await
 us
 and
 we're
 going


to
 pluck
 them,
 butcher
 them,
 eat
 them.


Okay.


We're
 here.
 There's
 no
 question
 this
 is


Steve's
 house
 because
 there's
 a


beautiful
 set
 of
 antlers
 hanging
 over


the
 garage.
 I
 think
 it's
 actually
 a
 full


skull.
 It's
 a
 huge
 full
 skull
 with


antlers
 just
 like
 the
 meat
 eater
 logo.


And
 a
 lot
 more
 antlers
 as
 we
 approach


the
 front
 door.
 Oh,
 the
 door's
 open.


Literally
 open
 door,
 which
 is
 very


welcoming.


Come
 on
 in.


>> Hi
 there.


>> Not
 up
 there
 anymore.


>> The
 whole
 family's
 here.


>> The
 whole
 family's
 here.


>> So,
 we
 arrive
 at
 Steve's
 house.


>> Okay.
 I'm
 Michael.


>> Hi,
 Michael.
 I'm
 Katie.


>> And
 we
 meet
 his
 wife,
 his
 three
 kids,


plus
 their
 friends.


>> Say
 hi.


>> Hi.


>> Hey.
 Well,
 go
 introduce
 yourself.


Introduce
 your
 friends.


>> Hi,
 everybody.


>> We'll
 go
 this
 way
 to
 start.


>> Okay.


>> You
 want
 to
 wear
 Do
 you
 want
 latex


gloves?
 You
 good?


>> I
 think
 I
 think
 I'm
 okay
 just
 doing
 it


with
 my
 bare
 hands.
 Get
 the
 bear
 in.


>> So,
 we're
 in
 your


>> in
 the
 garage.
 We
 could
 do
 it
 inside,


but
 we'll
 do
 it
 out
 here.


>> That
 makes
 sense
 to
 do
 it
 in
 the
 garage.


So,
 when
 you
 butcher,
 you
 put
 your


outside
 here
 in
 the
 garage.


>> Usually
 inside
 sometimes.
 Well,
 stuff


with
 feathers
 out
 here.


>> So,
 here
 are
 four
 ducks.


>> Yep.
 You
 want
 to
 see
 how
 to
 do
 it?


>> Yeah,
 I
 would
 like
 you
 to
 show
 me.


>> Okay.
 So,


>> so
 you're
 just
 grabbing
 all
 the
 feathers


on
 the
 chest
 and
 just
 pretty
 gently


ripping
 them
 off.


>> See,
 those
 are
 those
 could
 be
 teeth


marks
 from
 the
 dog
 or
 pellet.


Why
 does
 it
 feel
 like
 you're
 so
 my
 my


plucking
 is
 so
 insufficient?


>> Oh,
 it's
 a
 learned
 thing.


>> It's
 like
 it's
 like
 blowing
 on
 a
 call.


Like
 the
 [music]
 first
 time
 sucks
 and


you
 get
 better
 and
 better
 at
 it.


>> All
 right.
 I
 uh
 I
 think
 I'm
 ready
 to


face
 your
 judgment.


>> You're
 not
 close
 yet.


>> Like
 keep
 going.
 But


>> yeah,
 in
 the
 end
 in
 the
 end
 you'll
 get


it
 where
 you
 can
 you
 just
 kind
 of
 go


like
 this.


You
 don't
 need
 to
 do
 the
 back.
 Okay.


>> Unless
 you
 want
 a
 whole
 roster
 to
 bring


home.


>> Can
 you
 take
 duck
 interstate?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 you
 got
 you
 got
 to
 decide


like
 I
 would
 give
 you
 this
 one
 cuz
 this


one's
 perfect.
 So,
 we
 would
 pluck
 this,


leave
 a
 fully
 feathered
 wing,
 and
 you


can
 walk
 right
 on
 the
 plane
 with
 it.
 You


don't
 even
 need
 to
 check
 it.
 They
 might


detect
 an
 organic
 mass
 as
 they
 call
 it


in
 TSA
 land,
 [music]
 but
 you're
 not


there's
 no
 problem.
 You
 would
 just
 be


like,
 "No,
 I
 have
 a
 frozen
 I
 have
 frozen


food


>> and
 you're
 fine."
 if
 you'd
 like
 this
 to


bring
 [music]
 home
 cuz
 that's
 a
 perfect


spasm.
 Look
 at
 that
 thing.


>> It's
 beautiful.


>> Looks
 like
 something
 out
 of
 Christmas


Carol,
 don't
 it?


>> Yes,
 it
 does.


>> Yeah.


>> With
 just
 a
 couple
 of
 pellet
 marks.


>> Mhm.


>> I
 think
 I'm
 getting
 the
 neck
 of
 my
 butt


thumb
 movement.


>> No,
 you're
 looking
 good
 now.


>> So,
 that's
 what
 you're
 after.
 [music]


And
 we
 can
 even
 clean
 that
 up
 more
 with


a
 blowtorrch.
 But


>> So,
 that's
 with
 a
 blowtorrch.


So,
 just
 take
 this
 very
 from
 a
 distance.


Burn
 those
 little
 hairs
 off.


>> Mhm.


>> Is
 this
 the
 right
 distance?


>> Just
 Just
 enough
 where
 you
 watch
 them


just
 get
 zapped.


>> All right.
 Let
 me
 go
 get
 the
 top.


>> Is
 this
 uh


>> Yep.
 Just
 real
 light.
 Don't
 cook
 it.


>> Yeah.
 You're
 doing
 good.


>> No.
 When
 we
 wash
 them,
 they'll
 look
 real


good.


Did
 not
 expect
 to
 be
 using
 a
 blow
 torch.


>> Okay.
 See
 this?


See
 this
 breast
 bone?


>> Mhm.


>> Come
 in
 like
 that.


Then
 you
 know
 when
 you
 see
 chicken


tenders
 on
 a
 menu
 and
 kids
 want
 to
 order


them.


>> Mhm.


>> That's
 that
 that's
 a
 duck
 tender.


>> Oh,
 that's
 that
 kind
 of
 classic
 duck


fat.


>> See,
 that's
 that's
 good
 stuff.


>> Okay.
 Good.


>> Yeah.
 Head
 to
 the
 kitchen.


>> Yep.


>> And
 then
 we
 move
 from
 the
 garage
 into


the
 kitchen
 there.
 So


>> you
 kind
 of
 have
 an
 indoor
 kitchen


[music]
 and
 an
 outdoor
 kitchen.


>> Yeah.
 And
 that
 that's
 nice
 cuz
 it's


covered
 now.
 And
 winter
 [music]
 is
 long


>> where
 Steve
 has
 been
 preparing
 this
 wild


game
 feast.


>> Using
 every
 imaginable
 [music]
 cooking


method.
 He
 is
 using
 a
 smoker.


>> Oh,
 dude.
 That's
 overdone.


>> Ah,
 damn
 it.
 Apparently,
 we've


overcooked
 the
 turkey.


>> The
 wild
 turkey
 as
 is
 Thanksgiving


tradition.


>> Yes.
 Yes.
 Totally
 true.


>> He's
 using
 an
 open
 fire.


>> That's
 like
 that
 sousie
 goose.


>> And
 then
 you're
 putting
 it
 on
 a
 rack


>> just
 to
 like
 crisp
 it
 up.


>> Put
 on
 top
 of
 an
 open
 This
 is
 a
 rack
 on


an
 open
 fire.


>> Yep.
 [music]
 He's
 cooking
 it
 on
 a
 fire.


>> And
 one
 by
 one,
 these
 dishes
 emerge.


There's
 black
 bear
 that
 he
 hunted
 in


Alaska.
 [music]
 There's
 wild
 turkey
 and


Canadian
 goose
 from
 a
 hunting
 trip
 with


his
 kids.
 [music]
 And
 of
 course
 the


duck.


>> Like
 the
 best
 way
 to
 get
 it
 the
 skin


crisp.


>> This
 is
 the
 duck
 skin.


>> Yep.


>> Is
 to
 put
 it
 as
 soon
 as
 you
 [music]


start
 the
 burner.
 So


put
 them
 on
 there.
 Now
 and
 and
 don't


heat
 don't
 preheat
 it.
 [music]
 Like
 lay


them
 on
 there.


>> Okay.
 I'm
 going to
 put
 the
 skin
 down.


>> Skin
 down.
 You
 know
 what
 I'm
 saying?


>> Mhm.
 [music]
 Like
 if
 you
 put
 it
 on
 there


when
 it's
 hot,
 it
 does
 it
 doesn't
 work.


It
 doesn't
 get
 as
 crispy
 and
 it
 like


instantly
 [music]


like
 puckers
 up.


Then
 what
 you
 want
 to
 do
 Oh,
 from
 there


>> in
 the
 oven.


>> Flip
 it
 and
 then
 into
 the
 oven.
 400


>> in
 the
 oven.


>> Outside
 for
 a
 quick
 second.


>> Is
 this
 the
 time
 to
 tell
 you
 how
 anxious


I
 get
 about
 whether
 I'm
 overcooking


meats?


>> Oh,
 the
 duck.


>> The
 duck.


>> Not
 long.
 Okay,


>> we'll
 eat
 that
 real
 rare.
 The
 black
 bear


that
 I
 took
 out
 that
 has
 the
 bone


sticking
 out
 of
 the
 end
 that
 and
 I've


had
 trinosis
 from
 black
 bear
 that


>> that's
 good
 to
 know.


>> You
 have
 to
 cook
 the
 same
 way
 like
 in


the
 old
 days
 you
 had
 to
 cook
 pork
 really


well.


>> Yeah,


>> that
 was
 cooked
 in
 the
 oven
 for
 I
 saw


him
 with
 the
 thermometer
 checking
 it.


>> Oh,
 it's
 like
 it's
 like
 20°
 above


>> Okay.


>> what
 it
 needs
 to
 be.
 I
 I
 learned
 that.


>> So,
 now
 the
 duck
 is
 out
 of
 the
 oven.


Pretty


remarkable
 that
 that
 thing
 was
 flying


above
 our
 heads.


>> That's
 all
 it


>> four
 or
 five
 hours
 ago.


>> And
 then
 we
 sit
 down
 at
 Steve's
 dining


room
 table
 and
 all
 of
 this
 meat
 that


Steve
 has
 been
 cooking


>> is
 laid
 out
 in
 front
 of
 us.


>> This
 is
 a
 remarkable
 bounty
 you've


prepared
 for
 us.
 This
 table
 is
 filled


with
 meat.


>> It's
 light
 on
 veggies.
 But
 what
 we
 have


[laughter]


>> I
 would
 say
 it's
 very
 light
 on


>> what
 we
 have
 here.
 Try
 one
 of these.


These
 are
 good.
 So
 we
 grow
 carrots
 and


then
 pickle
 them.


>> All
 right.
 All right.
 What
 should
 where


should
 we
 start?


>> I
 ruined
 turkey.


>> So,
 we'll
 start
 with
 the
 worst.


>> We'll
 start
 with
 the
 ruined
 turkey.


[laughter]
 Terrible.


>> It's
 delicious.


>> Neutral.


>> Mhm.


>> Very
 dry.


>> I
 think
 my
 mother's
 done
 worse
 than


this.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 bear.


>> This
 is
 black
 bear.
 Um


>> I
 can
 definitely
 say
 I've
 never
 eaten


bear
 before.


>> Yeah.


>> Tastes
 like


>> You'd
 never
 know
 it
 was
 bear
 me.


>> Tastes
 like
 lamb
 or
 beef.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 lamb
 like


>> Mhm.


>> It's
 just
 funny
 about
 you
 never
 you'd


never
 flag
 it
 as
 unusual.


>> Mhm.


Now


>> is
 the
 sousied
 and
 grilled.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 Canada
 goose.


>> It's
 good.


>> And
 you
 can
 dress
 it
 up
 all
 kinds
 of


ways.


>> It's
 really
 tender.


>> Yeah.


>> I'm
 I'm
 very
 excited
 to
 try
 the
 duck.


>> Mhm.


>> I
 got
 cold.
 [laughter]


>> Got
 cold.


>> It
 took
 a
 long
 time.
 Nothing
 wrong
 with


cold
 duck.


>> Looks
 great.
 It's
 fatty.


Juicy.


>> Cold.


I'm
 just
 to
 take
 it
 back
 to
 our
 original


conversation.
 It's
 extremely
 gratifying


to
 consume


food
 that
 you
 yourself
 have


>> participated
 in
 hunting,
 defeathering,


butchering,
 cooking.
 It's
 like
 100%


start
 to
 finish


your
 food.


>> You're
 the
 only
 person
 ever
 touched
 it.


[music]
 You
 ever
 think
 about
 that?
 No


one's
 ever
 touched
 that


>> except
 us.
 Yeah.
 First
 person.
 Only


person.


>> Yeah.
 It's
 like
 I
 feel
 a
 certain
 level


of
 possessiveness
 over
 this
 food
 that
 I


don't
 think
 I've
 ever
 felt
 before.
 It's


not
 anonymous.


>> Yeah.
 You
 know,
 then
 you
 get
 into


freezer
 freezer
 hoarding
 and
 stuff
 like


that


where
 you
 get
 really
 weird
 or
 weird


[music]
 to
 your
 family
 about
 it
 and


everything.


>> There's
 a
 there's
 a
 thing
 that
 happens.


[laughter]


Just
 talk
 to
 my
 wife
 about
 sometimes.


Steve,
 I
 just
 wanted
 to
 thank
 you
 for


the
 time
 you
 spent
 with
 us,
 for
 the


lessons
 you've
 taught
 us,
 and
 express
 my


gratitude.
 Happy
 Thanksgiving.


>> Oh,
 happy
 Thanksgiving
 to
 [music]
 you.


Appreciate
 it.
 It


>> was
 a
 really
 special
 day
 for
 us.


>> Thank
 you
 very
 much.


>> A
 really
 profound
 experience.


>> Next
 time
 you
 see
 [music]
 a
 goose
 flying


by,
 you'd
 be
 like,
 "Now
 that


>> is
 what
 that
 tastes
 like."


>> When
 you
 see
 a
 goose
 in
 a
 golf
 course,


you
 like,
 "Now
 that
 bird
 is
 a
 worthwhile


[music]
 bird."


>> Mhm.

 [music]


>> Is
 this
 sanitary
 if
 I
 ask
 to
 try
 one
 of


these?


>> Um,
 I've
 got
 a
 duck
 hole
 you
 can
 try.


That
 is
 sanitary.


>> Yeah,
 got
 it.


No,
 just
 just


better.


I
 want
 one
 good
 call.
 Just


like
 not
 coming.

Whatever
 that
 is,
