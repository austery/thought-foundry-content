Karen van Kampen is a health and
science journalist.
How are you doing, Karen?
>> I'm well.
How are you?
>> I'm doing well.
Let's talk.
Dreams are quite complex.
There's emotion.
There's visual components to
help us understand what parts of
the brain are affiliated with
dreaming.
>> So different parts of the
brain are active at different
times in the sleep cycle.
One part of the brain that's
active during dreaming is the
emotional centre of your brain.
So the parts of the brain that
help process emotions that are
involved in our feelings, the
prefrontal cortex.
During REM sleep, it's less
active than when we're awake.
And that's the part of the brain
that really deals with making
decisions, thinking rationally.
And that's less active during
REM.
>> All right.
You mentioned REM and you
mentioned cycle.
So REM to simplify rapid eye
movement.
And then there is non-rapid eye
movement.
You mentioned which cycles we
dream in.
How do we know.
You know there's eye movement
that's very clear.
And when we talk about how do we
know that's where we dream.
>> So we dream through non-REM
and REM.
So non-REM sleep is stages one
through three.
Stages one, two and three is
non-REM sleep.
And REM sleep is stage four.
So we actually dream all through
the sleep cycle, all through the
night.
So that's.
>> Where the best, most vivid
dreams.
>> REM sleep.
So it's typically our most
intense, vivid emotional dreams
happen during REM and we get to
our first REM.
We go through 4 or 5 stages of
the sleep cycle a night.
And so we get it's about 90
minutes into the sleep cycle
that we have our first period of
REM.
>> Okay, reading your book, you
have, I would say, quite an
unusual childhood in terms of
what you were, what you
experienced, what drew you to
understand more about sleep and
dreams?
And I know your father had a lot
to do with that.
>> So my dad's a sleep doctor.
So I was always immersed in this
world of sleep, and I sort of
look at it as sleep was kind of
like this gateway to the world
of dreams.
And so I was always, you know,
always thinking about sleep and
trying to get enough sleep.
And sleep was a really big part
of growing up my childhood.
And then a few years ago, I read
this scientific study that said,
we're as dream deprived as we
are sleep deprived.
And it made me think, you know,
why do dreams matter on their
own?
You know, not just sleep.
Sleep is its own industry and
we're very focussed on sleep.
But what about dreams?
And then it got me.
It turned me on to the science
of dreaming.
>> As you mentioned, and what
we've talked about in terms of
the brain, we have come a long
way in terms of understanding
the brain.
Yes.
Do we better understand dreams?
I know this is a question of why
do we dream has been asked for
decades.
Yes.
But do we have a better
understanding of that?
>> So there's many possibilities
of why we dream.
So one idea is that we dream to
help dream sleep and dreams help
consolidate memories.
So let's say we've learned
something new during the day or
we've had a new experience.
It's thought that during sleep
and during dreams, it helps to
strengthen these memories.
So that's one thing is memory
consolidation.
>> So a cabinet of dreams that
you can put in and yes, exactly.
>> So and then it's really neat.
So one idea is it's called this.
It's called the next up model of
dreaming.
And I found this fascinating
because I've always wondered,
you know, why do I suddenly
dream of something from my
childhood or years ago.
Why do I do I choose to say
dream of it tonight?
What is it?
And this idea is that in order
to strengthen memories, say
recent experiences, recent
memories you associate it with,
with memories from your
catalogue of memories that are
already stored in your brain.
So that's it's finding
possibilities through these
connections, these unique and,
yeah, unique connections through
these associations.
>> Another theory is sort of
viewing dreams as sort of a
night therapy.
Talk me through that.
That sounds interesting.
>> It's so interesting.
So yeah.
So Matthew Walker, he so it's
dreams as overnight therapy.
And the whole idea about dreams
is overnight therapy.
And other dream researchers have
have also studied this is that
it helps to process our
emotions.
So it helps come to terms with,
say, difficult emotions.
Rosalind Cartwright, she was
known as the Queen of dreams.
And she did these studies on
people who were going through
divorce.
And she found out, if you dream,
you have these unsettling dreams
about your divorce.
You actually they the subjects
tended to cope better a year
later.
So that is also so it's it helps
to process the emotions but keep
the details of the memory.
>> There's also this thinking of
our dreams.
Some people may look at look at
them as two separate
compartments when we're awake
and we're falling asleep.
But when we wake up, sometimes
we might have solved some of the
issues that we dealt with.
Help us understand perhaps how
dreams kind of help us when we
wake up in our real world.
>> So it's thought that when
we're falling asleep, we sort of
tag certain ideas to revisit
later in the night.
So let's say you're you're
trying to, you know, you're
noodling around, you're thinking
about a problem you're trying to
solve.
You might be thinking about it
as you're falling asleep.
So during sleep onset, it's this
really unique time.
It's almost like a dreamy
brainstorming session.
>> It's like a to do list for
another to do list.
All right.
>> Exactly.
So you can like if you, you can
even guide your dream thoughts.
That's about dream engineering
okay.
And so let's say you want to
work on a problem.
You want to solve a problem, or
you want to think about a new
creative idea.
When you're falling asleep, you
can think about this idea, think
about this problem that you want
to work on.
And then oftentimes it will help
guide your dreams.
So those thoughts that you're
thinking about and dream
engineering uses technology to
help you guide and shape your
dreams.
So I did this dream experiment
and it was really fun.
And so basically I Adam ha, he's
a dream researcher and he helped
me set it up, this sort of ad
hoc dream experiment at home.
And so as I was just falling
asleep in sleep onset, the first
few minutes of sleep a
recording, I did a recording
before and then it would record
the recording played and it said
it was my voice and it said,
remember to think of a tree.
And then.
So then that would help guide my
my dreams.
>> And what did you dream that.
>> I dreamt about?
All these different trees.
First it was very concrete,
okay.
And I was dreaming of there was
this willow tree in front of
this cabin where our family used
to have this cabin.
And then it started to get the
farther I went into sleep onset,
it started getting more creative
and not as concrete and not as
logical.
Okay.
And then I thought of this time
that my husband, I got lost in
these woods, and then the trees
became waves.
And so it got very abstract.
Almost.
Yeah.
>> Speaking of abstract, let's
talk about lucid dreams.
I'm sure there are many
listeners who have probably had
a dream where they're running,
and then all of a sudden they're
like, hold on, I am dreaming, I
know I'm dreaming and probably
stop.
Explain to us about lucid
dreams.
What can you tell us about them?
Why do we have control?
>> So lucid dreaming is when it
starts with to be aware that
you're in a dream as the dream
is happening, so it's to have
that awareness and then once you
gain the awareness, it's to
develop that skill, to actually
learn that you your dream is a
it's a creation of your
imagination.
So you actually can be in
control.
So then you start to control
your dream characters or maybe
the plot you could choose, you
know what to do, what you've
always wanted to do.
Some people want to try and fly.
I read about I talked to a dream
researcher and he told me,
there's an artist and he
imagines an art gallery, okay.
And he opens the door and goes
into this art gallery, and
there's all these beautiful
paintings and their creation of
his own, his own imagination and
mind.
So then he wakes up and sketches
out what he was dreaming.
>> All right.
I feel like there's a lot of a
lot of power to harness here if
we can really sort of figure it
out.
On the flip side, there's
something that you talk about in
your book called Dream
Advertising.
Yes.
Help us understand what that is.
>> So it was brought up a few
years ago.
And so basically we are more we
are vulnerable when we're
sleeping.
And so the question was brought
up, let's say if we have a
speaker in our in our bedroom
and it could, you know, if we're
susceptible to ideas and
thoughts, could it then could we
be influenced, say, if a company
wanted to, you know, say, push
their product while we were
sleeping?
Yeah.
So that's kind of what it is.
So, you know, the is it is it
probable, is it possible these
are sort of, you know, things
where technically, if we're
susceptible to suggestion at
certain times of the sleep
cycle, but is it really probable
that this will change our, say,
buying and consumer habits?
>> What does that tell us about
the power of dreams in our
lives?
>> I think that dreams are so
powerful.
I mean, it's it makes me think,
you know, we spend a third of
our lives asleep and a large
portion of that time dreaming,
and there's this whole, this
mental life that we have there
that we can tap into to try and
guide our dreams for creativity,
to solve problems.
And then in the morning, use our
dreams to better understand,
say, our preoccupations or our
concerns.
What's sort of weighing on our
minds.
>> During the production of this
book?
You have delved into a number of
studies.
I am curious, what's one that
kind of left you sitting back
and being like that is like,
amazing to think how our brain
works when it comes to dreams.
>> So the the work that I was
so, so dream engineering for
sure that I talked about and
then also anaesthesia dreams.
So it's a group of researchers
at Stanford and they've
discovered that if you keep a
patient at a certain brain state
just under the level of
consciousness, they come to this
calm, relaxed state.
And it's wonderful because you
can revisit potentially
difficult and even traumatic
experiences and events.
But having this calm state so
you're able to revisit them and
then almost create new memories
of them.
And so I spoke with people who
had these experiences as well,
and they said they were life
altering, transforming.
So it's it's unbelievable.
Actually.
>> The potential.
>> Is the potential.
>> Yeah.
There's so much there.
I can't imagine what's what your
bedside table looks like, but I
imagine there's probably a book
and a pen there.
Yes, I will admit, before this
interview this weekend, I was
trying to remember my dreams
because lots of people, when
they share dreams, they want
some interpretation of the
symbols.
Yes.
How do we take full advantage of
our dreams?
>> So I always think we're the
best interpreter of our own
dreams.
So we it's how we want to tap
into them, delve into them, look
at them differently.
You know, we know if let's say
there's a certain theme or even
a person keeps showing up.
The way I look at it is it's
like our dreams are saying, you
know, pay more attention to this
idea, or maybe this person,
that's something that you can
do.
I did a dream salon.
>> I did read about this.
Yes.
Okay.
>> So it was so interesting.
I've never shared a dream
before.
And so it was with a group of
friends and dream researchers.
And it was so interesting
because I shared a dream and the
perspectives that other people
had.
So you, you share your dream and
then different people say, you
know, if it was my dream, I
would maybe think about this.
And it totally changed my
perspective on my dreams.
And then, you know, you can you
can look at it from other
people's perspectives and, and
see what works for you.
>> Very fascinating stuff.
This is a really exciting read.
Lots of potential as we talked
about.
Karen, thank you so much for
this.
Really appreciate it.
>> Thank you.
It was great chatting.
