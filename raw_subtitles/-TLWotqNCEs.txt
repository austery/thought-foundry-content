From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Rachel


Abrams


and
 this
 is
 the
 daily.


President
 Trump
 says
 that
 the
 United


States
 has
 now
 seized
 an
 oil
 tanker
 off


the
 coast
 of
 Venezuela.
 And
 so
 this
 is


>> since
 December,
 the
 US
 has
 been
 stopping


and
 seizing
 oil
 tankers
 traveling
 in
 and


out
 of
 Venezuela.


>> Largest
 one
 ever
 seized,
 actually.
 after


President
 Trump
 imposed
 a
 blockade
 on


ships
 carrying
 sanctioned
 Venezuelan


oil.


>> Showing
 US
 helicopters
 surrounding
 the


ship.
 You
 see
 that
 there?


>> Ships
 that
 are
 part
 of
 what's
 known
 as
 a


ghost
 fleet.


>> That's
 the
 US
 Coast
 Guard
 seizing


another
 ghost
 fleet
 tanker.


>> This
 now
 as
 the
 US
 is
 pursuing
 a
 third


oil
 tanker
 near
 Venezuela.


>> Oil
 tankers
 that
 try
 to
 secretly
 make


their
 way
 around
 the
 world.


>> Four
 vessels
 are
 now
 in
 American


custody.
 Several
 more
 are
 being
 tracked.


It
 marks
 the
 fifth
 tanker
 the
 US
 has


seized
 a
 sixth
 oil
 tanker.
 Now


>> a
 seventh
 sanctioned
 oil
 tanker


>> funding
 pro
 states
 like
 Venezuela,
 Iran,


and
 Russia.


Today,
 my
 colleague
 Christian
 Tbert
 on


what
 these
 ghost
 fleets
 are
 exactly
 and


how
 their
 days
 might
 be
 numbered.


It's
 Tuesday,
 January
 27th.


Christian,
 welcome
 to
 the
 Daily.


>> Thank
 you.
 So
 Christian,
 the
 US
 has
 been


seizing
 and
 stopping
 oil
 tankers
 coming


in
 and
 out
 of
 Venezuela
 for
 weeks
 now.


And
 at
 first
 this
 seemed
 like
 part
 of
 a


pressure
 campaign
 against
 President


Nicholas
 Maduro,
 but
 then
 obviously
 the


US
 captured
 Maduro.
 And
 I
 think
 a
 lot
 of


people
 assumed
 that
 this
 effort,
 this


pressure
 on
 the
 ships
 would
 stop,
 but


instead
 it's
 actually
 not
 only


continued,
 but
 expanded.
 You
 are
 the


newsroom's
 resident
 expert
 on
 these
 oil


tankers.
 You've
 been
 tracking
 all
 of


this
 as
 part
 of
 our
 visual


investigations
 team.
 So
 let's
 start
 at


the
 very
 beginning.
 What
 is
 a
 ghost


fleet
 or
 shadow
 fleet?


>> That's
 a
 very
 good
 question.
 Besides


shadow
 fleet
 and
 ghost
 fleet,
 there's
 a


third
 term
 which
 is
 dark
 fleet.
 So


>> it's
 interesting
 because
 there's
 not
 a


well-
 definfined
 definition.
 It's


basically
 a
 term
 for
 oil
 tankers
 that


use
 deceptive
 practices
 to
 kind
 of
 hide


that
 they're
 transporting
 sanctioned


oil.
 Oil
 that's
 sanctioned
 by
 the
 United


States.
 And
 these
 ships
 want
 to
 hide


that
 they're
 picking
 up
 this
 oil
 and


delivering
 this
 oil.
 Why
 do
 I
 know
 a
 lot


about
 it?
 Is
 because
 that
 after
 the


full-scale
 invasion
 of
 Ukraine
 by
 Russia


in
 February
 2022,


there
 was
 this
 same
 sudden
 surge
 in


interest
 like
 ghost
 fleet,
 dark
 fleet,


shadow
 fleet.
 And
 my
 manager
 asked
 me


like,
 Chris,
 can
 you
 find
 out
 what
 are


actually
 the
 ships
 of
 this
 fleet?
 So


that's
 how
 it
 started
 for
 me.
 But
 there


are
 hundreds
 of
 tankers,
 maybe
 even


thousands.
 We
 don't
 really
 know.
 And


basically
 these
 tankers
 are
 shipping


sanctioned
 Russian
 oil
 or
 sanctioned


Iranian
 oil
 and
 Venezuelan
 oil.
 They're


always
 shipping
 oil
 for
 either
 of
 these


three
 countries
 and
 sometimes
 for
 all


three.
 Most
 of
 the
 oil
 goes
 to
 China
 and


a
 significant
 portion
 goes
 to
 India
 as


well
 and
 these
 ships
 have
 decided
 to
 do


that.
 There's
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 to
 make
 if


you're
 shipping
 sanctioned
 oil
 and


they're
 trying
 to
 hide
 that.


>> Got
 it.
 Okay.
 So,
 do
 you
 have
 any
 sense


given
 the
 fact
 that
 this
 is
 literally


called
 a
 shadow
 fleet
 of
 how
 much
 of
 the


world's
 oil
 is
 transported
 this
 way?


>> It's
 hard
 to
 say,
 right?
 Because
 they're


obviously
 trying
 to
 deceive
 everyone


that
 they're
 actually
 shipping
 this
 oil,


but
 it's
 probably
 around
 like
 10
 to
 20%


of
 oil
 tankers
 worldwide
 that
 have


engaged
 in
 this
 kind
 of
 activity,
 which


is
 quite
 a
 bit.
 But
 given
 that
 it's
 only


related
 to
 Russia,
 Iran,
 and
 Venezuela,


the
 share
 of
 the
 oil
 on
 the
 world
 market


is
 about
 3
 to
 9%
 according
 to
 the
 data


that's
 available.


>> So
 obviously
 sanctions
 are
 meant
 to
 hurt


countries
 economically,
 but
 what
 are
 the


goals
 in
 these
 specific
 cases?
 So
 the


point
 of
 these
 US
 sanctions
 is
 to


basically
 limit
 the
 revenue
 that's
 going


to
 the
 Kremlin
 to
 fund
 their
 war
 effort


in
 Ukraine
 to
 Iran,
 which
 the
 US
 says,


you
 know,
 they're
 using
 the
 revenue
 from


oil
 to
 fund
 their
 activities
 with


Hezbollah
 and
 other
 other
 activities


that
 the
 US
 doesn't
 like.
 And
 the
 same


with
 Venezuela.
 It's
 it's
 it's
 propping


up
 the
 Maduro
 government
 at
 the
 time.


>> But
 what
 we
 have
 seen
 is
 that
 they're


successful
 in
 shipping
 this
 oil
 around


the
 world
 and
 still
 earning
 significant


amounts
 of
 money


>> on
 that
 oil.
 basically
 nobody's
 stopping


them
 even
 though
 technically
 there
 are


sanctions
 in
 place.


>> Yes,
 that's
 exactly
 right.
 These
 ships


have
 been
 shipping
 that
 oil
 and
 there's


not
 really
 any
 kind
 of
 enforcement
 on


these
 ships.
 So
 the
 shipments
 of
 oil


just
 continue.
 But
 all
 of
 that
 changed


in
 December.


>> Okay.
 So
 let's
 talk
 about
 what
 happened


in
 December.
 What
 specifically
 did
 we


start
 seeing?


In
 December,
 there's
 this
 very
 large


military
 pressure
 campaign
 on
 the
 Maduro


government
 in
 Venezuela
 by
 the
 US.


>> There's
 a
 buildup
 of
 a
 huge
 military


force
 ahead
 of,
 of
 course,
 Maduro's


capture.
 But
 also,
 the
 Trump


administration
 said
 any
 oil
 tankers
 that


want
 to
 ship
 Venezuelan
 oil
 that
 is
 not


going
 to
 the
 United
 States,
 we're
 going


to
 stop
 these
 vessels,
 port
 them,
 and


potentially
 even
 seize
 them.
 And
 that


was
 not
 just
 like
 an
 empty
 threat.
 it


actually
 started
 happening.


>> We
 begin
 with
 the
 Trump
 administration's


dramatic
 escalation
 with
 Venezuela
 and


the
 Nicholas
 Maduro
 regime,
 seizing
 an


oil
 tanker
 off
 the
 coast
 of
 Venezuela.


>> We
 saw
 one
 tanker
 being
 stopped,
 another


tanker
 being
 stopped.


>> Commandos
 took
 over
 another
 tanker,
 fast


roping
 onto
 the
 deck
 and
 moving
 up
 to


the
 bridge
 to
 see


>> and
 another
 tanker
 being
 chased
 for


weeks


>> and
 this
 one
 tried
 to
 get
 away.
 It


resulted
 in
 a
 sort
 of
 a
 slow
 motion
 uh


chase.
 Uh


>> so
 basically
 suddenly
 after
 years
 of
 not


enforcing
 these
 sanctions
 the
 US
 now


seems
 very
 serious
 about
 stopping
 these


ghost
 fleets.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 it
 had
 a
 very


interesting
 effect
 on
 this
 very
 large


group
 of
 hundreds
 if
 not
 thousands
 of


tankers
 that
 are
 part
 of
 the
 shadow


fleet
 because
 we
 saw
 that
 other
 tankers


were
 already
 going
 to
 Venezuela
 that


kind
 of
 like
 turned
 around
 and
 were
 like


oh
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 get
 boarded
 by
 a
 US


Navy
 vessel.


>> They
 were
 spooked.


>> They
 were
 spooked.
 And
 at
 the
 same
 time,


the
 tankers
 that
 were
 already
 in


Venezuela
 were
 kind
 of
 like
 m
 we


probably
 should
 stay
 in
 Venezuela
 and


probably
 shouldn't
 leave.
 And
 then
 in


the
 beginning
 of
 January,


>> the
 United
 States
 of
 America
 has


successfully
 carried
 out
 a
 large-scale


strike
 against
 Venezuela
 and
 its
 leader,


President
 Nicholas
 Maduro,
 who
 has
 been


captured
 and
 flown
 out
 of
 the
 country.


The
 United
 States
 enters
 Venezuela
 and


captures
 Maduro
 and
 it's
 chaos.
 And
 I


got
 this
 call
 from
 Anatoli,
 our


colleague
 in
 Venezuela,
 and
 he's
 like,


"Hey,
 Chris,
 I
 am
 being
 told
 that
 four


tankers
 have
 left
 port."
 And
 I'm
 like,


"Okay,
 let
 let
 me
 check."
 And
 indeed,
 on


satellite
 imagery,
 it
 was
 visible
 that


these
 four
 tankers
 had
 departed


Venezuelan
 waters
 and
 were
 sailing


north.
 Mhm.


>> But
 not
 only
 that,
 I
 also
 realized
 that


besides
 these
 four
 tinkers,
 there
 were


12
 others
 that
 just
 disappeared.


>> What
 do
 you
 mean
 by
 disappeared?


>> They
 disappeared
 on
 satellite
 imagery.


They
 were
 there
 the
 day
 before
 and
 the


next
 day
 they
 were
 gone.


>> So
 it
 seemed
 all
 these
 tankers
 left
 in
 a


coordinated
 effort
 to
 defy
 the
 partial


blockade
 by
 the
 United
 States
 on
 on


Venezuelan
 oil
 experts.
 And
 one
 expert
 I


talked
 to
 said
 this
 is
 a
 zombie
 race.


>> A
 zombie
 race,


>> right?
 So
 when
 you
 leave
 altogether
 in
 a


group
 of
 16,
 the
 odds
 that
 you're
 going


to
 get
 caught
 are
 way
 smaller
 than
 when


it's
 just
 one
 vessel
 leaving
 or
 two


vessels
 leaving
 cuz
 the
 United
 States


has
 a
 huge
 military
 force
 buildup
 around


Venezuela.
 But
 we
 saw
 that,
 you
 know,


over
 the
 holidays
 for
 three
 weeks
 they


chase
 one
 tanker.
 Mhm.


>> Imagine
 having
 to
 chase
 16
 of
 them.
 So


the
 odds
 for
 these
 tankers
 leaving
 in
 a


coordinated
 effort.
 The
 odds
 of
 being


captured
 by
 the
 United
 States
 are
 way


smaller.


>> Strengthen
 numbers.


>> Strength
 in
 numbers
 indeed.
 Which
 is


very
 striking
 that
 you
 can
 imagine
 that


oh
 Maduro's
 being
 captured
 and
 all
 these


ships
 are
 basically
 deciding
 amongst


themselves,
 are
 we
 going
 to
 go
 make
 a


run
 for
 it


>> or
 not?


>> And
 it
 seemed
 a
 group
 of
 16
 indeed
 did.


So
 me
 and
 my
 colleagues
 were
 thinking,


what's
 going
 on?
 Where
 have
 these


tankers
 gone?
 And
 will
 they
 be
 able
 to


outrun
 the
 Americans,
 which
 would
 be


wild,
 right?
 Because
 this
 is
 arguably


the
 most
 powerful
 military
 in
 the
 world.


And
 are
 they
 continuing
 to
 evade
 these


sanctions
 on
 them
 or
 will
 they


eventually
 get
 caught?


>> So
 we
 set
 out
 and
 tried
 to
 find
 out.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Christian,
 before
 the
 break,
 you


described
 this
 kind
 of
 cat-and-
 mouse


game
 that
 the
 US
 has
 been
 playing
 with


these
 ships
 and
 this
 question
 of
 whether


the
 US
 will
 ultimately
 be
 successful
 in


enforcing
 its
 sanctions,
 specifically


with
 these
 16
 oil
 tankers,
 which
 as
 you


described
 seem
 to
 have
 just
 sort
 of


disappeared
 from
 Venezuelan
 waters.
 You


had
 mentioned
 that
 you
 and
 our


colleagues
 wanted
 to
 set
 out
 to
 find
 out


where
 they'd
 gone.
 Tell
 us
 how
 you


started
 doing
 that.


Yeah.
 So,
 these
 ships
 engage
 in
 a
 lot
 of


deceptive
 practices
 and
 because
 they
 use


these
 deceptive
 techniques,
 it's
 pretty


hard.
 But
 if
 you
 know
 where
 to
 look,
 you


can
 get
 some
 pretty
 good
 clues.


>> Well,
 how
 do
 you
 even
 know
 where
 to


look?


>> So,
 for
 example,
 every
 oil
 tanker
 needs


to
 send
 out
 a
 location
 signal,
 which
 is


for
 safety.
 They're
 very
 big,
 and
 you


know,
 if
 they
 don't
 send
 out
 a
 location


signal
 and
 another
 ship
 doesn't
 see
 them


in
 low
 visibility,
 for
 instance,
 it's


going
 to
 be
 a
 disaster.
 So,
 there's
 an


agreement.
 all
 the
 bit
 large
 ships


should
 send
 out
 this
 transponder
 signal.


But
 the
 transponder
 signal
 also
 allows


anyone
 on
 the
 planet
 to
 kind
 of
 see


where
 these
 ships
 are.
 Um
 website
 called


Marine
 Traffic
 and
 you
 know
 you
 can
 see


thousands
 of
 vessels
 that
 you
 can
 just


track
 in
 real
 time.
 But
 from
 all
 those


16
 ships
 that
 disappeared
 from


Venezuelan
 waters,
 we
 couldn't
 track
 any


of
 them.
 Why?
 because
 they
 either


switched
 off
 their
 transponder
 signal,


which
 means
 going
 dark,
 or
 they
 faked


their
 location
 signal
 to
 pretend
 they're


actually
 of
 the
 coast
 of
 West
 Africa
 or


Asia.
 A
 method
 that's
 known
 as
 spoofing.


They're
 spoofing
 their
 location
 signal.


>> Okay.
 So,
 I
 understand
 all
 of
 that.
 I


think
 it
 sounds
 like
 it's
 VPN,
 but
 for


ships,
 right?


>> Right.


>> But
 then
 how
 do
 you
 actually
 go
 about


figuring
 out
 where
 the
 ships
 are?


>> So,
 we
 basically
 just
 look
 at
 satellite


imagery.
 It
 shows
 the
 coast.
 It
 shows


the
 water.
 And
 it
 shows
 ships
 in
 the


sea.
 And
 I
 can
 see
 there
 is
 a
 tanker


with
 a
 red
 deck.
 There
 is
 a
 larger


tanker
 with
 a
 green
 deck.
 And
 we're


trying
 to
 identify
 which
 tankers
 they


are.


>> Do
 you
 have
 picture
 satellite
 images
 on


your
 computer
 to
 show
 me
 that
 we
 can


kind
 of
 describe
 a
 little bit?
 Let
 me


I'm
 going
 to
 move
 my
 seat
 over.


>> Okay.
 So
 now
 what
 we're
 looking
 at
 is
 a


tab
 on
 this
 marine
 traffic
 website
 that


looks
 like
 a
 map
 of
 Venezuela
 with


thousands
 of
 arrows
 that
 are
 red
 or


purple
 or
 green.
 Tell
 us
 what
 these


different
 color
 codings
 mean
 and
 what
 is


an
 individual
 arrow.


>> So
 every
 arrow
 is
 a
 ship
 that's
 sending


out
 a
 location
 signal.
 Green
 means
 it's


carrying
 cargo.
 Purple
 means
 it's
 like
 a


pleasure
 craft.
 So
 like
 a
 yacht
 or
 a


cruise
 ship.
 And
 red
 are
 tankers.
 And


that's
 what
 we're
 interested
 in.


>> Okay.


>> And
 what
 you
 can
 see
 here
 is
 three


vessels,
 right?


>> I
 see
 three
 red
 arrows.
 Yep.
 Okay.


>> But
 if
 we
 look
 at
 the
 satellite
 image,


we
 can
 see
 that
 there
 are
 way
 more
 ships


there.


>> There
 are
 way
 more
 than
 three
 oil


tankers
 on
 the
 satellite
 image.
 And
 yet


when
 we
 look
 at
 the
 marine
 website,


you're
 saying
 there
 are
 only
 three
 ships


that
 are
 sending
 out
 transponder


signals.


>> Exactly.
 So
 all
 these
 ships
 that
 send


out
 a
 legitimate
 signal,
 they're
 usually


okay
 because
 they
 have
 nothing
 to
 hide,


right?
 They're
 showing
 that
 they're
 in


Venezuela
 and
 they're
 saying
 like
 that's


for
 anyone
 to
 see
 on
 the
 world.
 Anyone


with
 internet
 connection
 can
 see,
 hey,


they're
 sending
 out
 this
 signal
 from


Venezuela.
 But
 I'm
 very
 interested
 in


the
 ships
 that
 appear
 in
 the
 satellite


image,
 but
 that
 are
 not
 sending
 out
 a


signal.
 So
 they're
 not
 visible
 on
 that


website.
 So
 then
 I
 can
 try
 to
 identify


these
 ships
 by
 zooming
 in
 on
 the


satellite
 image,
 seeing
 what
 color
 the


deck
 is,
 how
 long
 it
 is,
 how
 wide
 it
 is,


and
 then
 I
 can
 check
 that
 information


against
 a
 database
 of
 tankers
 that
 I've


built
 up
 over
 the
 past
 few
 years


together
 with
 my
 colleagues
 that
 list


tankers
 that
 are
 in
 the
 shadow
 fleet
 by


name.
 But
 it's
 very
 tricky
 because
 they


change
 their
 names
 not
 only
 in
 online


registries
 or
 shipping
 registries,
 but


also
 when
 you
 would
 see
 the
 ship
 in


person.
 There's
 a
 group
 called
 tanker


trackers.com
 company
 that
 is
 specialized


in
 this
 and
 they
 have
 a
 photographer
 on


shore
 in
 Venezuela
 that
 kind
 of
 like


secretly
 takes
 photos
 of
 these
 tankers.


These
 photos
 are
 usually
 not
 published,


but
 we
 have
 access
 to
 them
 and
 we
 can


get
 an
 insight
 on
 how
 how
 do
 these
 ships


actually
 look
 like
 from
 the
 ground,


right?
 Sometimes
 we
 try
 to
 find
 out


which
 tankers
 they
 are
 by
 trying
 to
 see


if
 there's
 any
 sailors
 on
 board,
 any


crew
 members
 that
 are
 maybe
 posting
 a


Tik
 Tok
 video
 or
 Instagram
 videos.


>> What
 are
 they
 posting
 about
 exactly?
 Is


it
 like, "Hi,
 I'm
 on
 a
 ship


>> about
 their
 lives."
 And
 they're
 like


excited.
 Maybe
 it's
 the
 first
 time
 in


their
 lives
 they're
 in
 Venezuela.


They're
 like, "Hey,
 look
 where
 I
 am.


This
 is
 so
 pretty."
 And
 they're
 showing


their
 family
 members.
 They're
 showing


their
 fellow
 merchant
 navy
 crew
 members


like
 where
 they
 are.
 And
 it's
 a
 whole


community
 online.
 And
 you
 know,
 it's


interesting
 like
 the
 oil
 is
 sanctioned


and
 they're
 engaged
 in
 what
 the
 US
 sees


as
 illegal
 activity.
 But
 of
 course,
 like


if
 this
 oil
 is
 being
 picked
 up
 in


Venezuela,
 then
 brought
 to
 China
 and


your
 crew
 member
 on
 board
 of
 the
 ship,


why
 would
 you
 really
 care
 about
 US


sanctions?


>> It
 feels
 like
 if
 you're
 going
 to
 go


through
 all
 this
 effort
 to
 obscure
 your


name
 and
 location,
 you
 would
 tell
 the


people
 that
 work
 on
 your
 ship,
 please


don't
 post
 to
 Tik
 Tok.


>> You
 would
 think
 so,
 but
 it
 seems
 uh
 we


as
 human
 beings
 just
 love
 to
 share


things
 on
 social
 media.


>> I
 guess
 so.
 What
 can
 you
 learn
 from


these
 photos
 and
 videos?
 Then


>> what
 is
 very
 fascinating
 is
 that
 we
 have


seen
 ships
 that
 are
 obscuring
 their
 own


name.
 Mhm.


>> In
 in
 very
 like
 kind
 of
 like
 rudimentary


ways
 like
 we've
 seen
 bed
 sheets
 being


hung
 over
 the
 hole
 to
 obscure
 the
 name


and
 in
 many
 instances
 actually
 we
 have


seen
 them
 just
 like
 completely
 painting


over
 their
 actual
 name
 and
 just
 putting


on
 the
 name
 not
 of
 a
 fake
 ship
 but
 of
 a


real
 ship
 that
 is
 kind
 of
 like
 the
 same


in
 its
 appearance
 but
 a
 ship
 that


actually
 when
 you
 go
 to
 databases
 you


realize
 that's
 a
 ship
 that
 has
 been
 sent


to
 the
 scrapyard
 doesn't
 exist
 anymore.


So,
 it's
 a
 lot
 of
 ways
 of
 obscuring


their
 real
 identities,
 but
 that
 makes
 it


also
 kind
 of
 fascinating
 and
 and
 fun
 to


find
 out,
 can
 I
 find
 out
 which
 tanker
 it


is?


>> Okay,
 so
 they're
 hiding
 where
 they
 are.


They're
 hiding
 their
 real
 names.
 What


else
 are
 they
 doing
 in
 order
 to
 operate


in
 secret?


>> So,
 they
 also
 change
 their
 flag.
 So,
 all


these
 large
 vessels
 need
 to
 be


registered
 in
 a
 country
 and
 then
 they're


flying
 the
 flag
 of
 that
 country.
 So
 they


can
 for
 instance
 say
 like
 oh
 we're


flying
 the
 flag
 of
 Cameroon
 or
 the


Marshall
 Islands
 or
 Panama
 or
 Ghana.
 Um


but
 actually
 when
 you
 go
 to
 the
 shipping


registries
 of
 these
 countries
 it
 turns


out
 that
 they're
 at
 times
 not
 even


registered
 there.
 So
 they're
 flying
 a


fake
 flag.
 And
 what
 we've
 seen
 recently


a
 lot
 is
 ships
 changing
 their
 flags
 to


Russia.


>> And
 why
 Russia?


>> Because
 they
 think
 it
 will
 protect
 them


against
 US.
 Like
 boarding
 a
 vessel
 like


US
 is
 boarding
 vessels
 and
 saying,
 "Hey,


you're
 not
 flying
 a
 real
 flag."
 But


boarding
 a
 ship
 that
 actually
 flies
 an


official
 Russian
 flag
 is
 a
 whole
 another


thing.
 It
 could
 cause
 a
 major
 diplomatic


crisis
 between
 these
 two
 superpowers.


And
 that's
 interesting
 because
 if
 that's


what
 they're
 trying
 to
 do,
 claim
 Russian


protection,
 it
 hasn't
 worked
 because
 the


United
 States
 has
 already
 boarded
 two


vessels
 that
 were
 flying
 an
 official


Russian
 flag.


>> But
 just
 to
 go
 back
 to
 the
 16
 tankers


that
 left
 Venezuela
 right
 after
 Maduro


was
 captured,
 what
 were
 you
 able
 to
 find


out
 about
 those
 tankers
 and
 where
 they


went?
 So,
 of
 these
 16
 vessel
 that


disappeared,
 we
 found
 a
 couple
 that
 were


sailing
 in
 the
 Caribbean
 Sea,
 but
 also
 a


couple
 that
 were
 already
 far
 out
 in
 the


Atlantic
 Ocean.


>> So,
 we
 contacted
 the
 United
 States
 and


said
 like,
 "Are
 you
 are
 you
 aware
 of


these
 ships?
 Are
 you
 like
 are
 they
 going


to
 be
 stopped?
 Like,
 what
 what's
 going


on?"


>> You
 contacted
 the
 military.


>> We
 contacted
 the
 military,
 my
 colleagues


did,
 and
 they
 said,
 "Yeah,
 we're


tracking
 them
 and
 we're
 trying
 to
 seize


some
 of
 them."
 And
 that
 actually


happened.
 At
 least
 three
 of
 the
 vessels


that
 we
 reported
 on
 that
 had
 disappeared


were
 indeed
 stopped
 and
 boarded
 by
 the


United
 States.
 But
 what's
 also
 very


interesting
 to
 me
 is
 that
 some
 of
 these


vessels
 actually
 seem
 to
 have
 made
 it


through.
 There
 is
 a
 group
 that's
 still


sailing
 out
 there
 and
 is
 by
 now
 probably


close
 to
 Africa.


>> The
 zombie
 race
 worked
 out
 for
 them.
 And


there
 is
 another
 group
 of
 tankers
 that


turned
 around
 and
 went
 back
 to
 Venezuela


and
 seems
 to
 be
 obeying
 US
 orders
 right


now.


>> And
 what
 does
 that
 mean?
 It's
 hard
 to


know
 exactly
 what's
 happening,
 but
 after


Madura
 was
 captured,
 the
 US
 basically


started
 directing
 where
 Venezuela's
 oil


is
 allowed
 to
 go
 and
 where
 these
 tinkers


can
 ship
 it.
 And
 they
 are
 shipping


Venezuelan
 oil
 now
 to
 storage
 sites
 in


the
 Caribbean,
 hoping
 to
 sell
 that


Venezuelan
 oil
 on
 the
 global
 world


market,
 but
 under
 the
 US
 directive.
 M


>> so
 what
 you
 kind
 of
 see
 is
 that
 some
 of


these
 shadow
 fleet
 vessels
 are
 now


working
 for
 what
 the
 US
 wants.


>> I'm
 still
 kind
 of
 struck
 by
 the
 fact


that
 these
 ships
 are
 going
 through
 all


of
 this
 effort
 to
 evade
 the
 authorities


which
 seems
 to
 have
 worked
 except
 here


you
 are
 Christian
 you
 have
 been
 able
 to


track
 so
 many
 of
 them.
 So
 I
 sort
 of


wonder
 if
 you've
 been
 able
 to
 track
 so


many
 of
 them
 through
 Tik
 Tok
 or
 other


means,
 satellite
 images.
 Why
 has
 this


been
 able
 to
 go
 on
 for
 so
 long?


>> So
 these
 sanctions
 come
 from
 the
 US


Treasury
 Department,
 but
 they're
 not


usually
 the
 enforcer
 of
 these
 sanctions,


right?
 We
 see
 that
 now.
 Like
 these
 ships


are
 not
 being
 stopped
 by
 a
 ship
 from
 US


Treasury
 Department.
 They're
 being


stopped
 by
 the
 US
 Navy
 or,
 you
 know,
 the


US
 Coast
 Guard.
 And
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 relied


on
 kind
 of
 like
 self-regulation,
 meaning


like
 you're
 let's
 say
 an
 oil
 trader
 or
 a


shipper
 or
 whatever,
 you
 probably
 don't


want
 to
 touch
 that
 Iranian
 oil
 because


if
 you
 do,
 you
 may
 get
 in
 trouble
 with


the
 US
 authorities
 and
 that
 means
 like


the
 next
 time
 you
 get
 a
 job
 in
 like


picking
 up
 oil
 in
 the
 US
 and
 bringing
 it


somewhere,
 you're
 probably
 not
 going
 to


get
 that
 job
 because
 you
 touched
 Iranian


oil
 in
 the
 past.
 But
 there's
 also


something
 else
 that's
 been
 going
 on
 and


has
 been
 allowed
 to
 go
 on
 and
 that's
 to


do
 with
 insurance.


>> Insurance.


>> Insurance.
 Absolutely.
 Because
 you
 can


imagine
 if
 this
 if
 if
 an
 accident


happens
 with
 one
 of
 these
 big
 ships


laden
 with
 oil
 and
 it
 hits
 something
 in


a
 port
 and
 there's
 a
 huge
 oil
 spill,


that's
 going
 to
 cost
 billions
 and


billions
 of
 dollars.
 So
 all
 these
 ships


need
 to
 have
 insurance.
 And
 many
 ports


in
 the
 world,
 doesn't
 matter
 whether


it's
 Houston
 or
 whether
 it's
 a
 port
 in


Iran
 or
 a
 port
 in
 China,


>> these
 ports
 will
 say
 like,
 "Hey,
 do
 you


have
 legitimate
 insurance?"
 Because,
 you


know,
 if
 something
 happens,
 we
 want
 to


make
 sure
 that
 someone
 pays
 for
 the


cleanup.


>> So,
 okay,
 I
 understand
 why
 you
 might


want
 an
 insurance
 company
 to
 ensure
 your


boat
 full
 of
 oil.
 But
 if
 you
 are
 in
 a


legally
 operating
 boat
 full
 of
 oil,
 how


do
 you
 get
 insurance?


>> I
 mean,
 there
 are
 not
 that
 many
 insurers


in
 the
 world
 that
 can
 take
 this
 on.
 And


most
 of
 these
 insurance
 companies
 are


based
 in
 western
 countries.
 So
 what
 has


been
 happening
 is
 that
 many
 of
 these


shadow
 fleet
 oil
 tankers
 are
 lying
 to


these
 insurers
 when
 they
 ask
 for


insurance.
 But
 what
 has
 happened


recently
 uh
 maybe
 partly
 because
 of
 the


reporting
 we
 did
 on
 that
 um
 and
 also


just
 in
 general
 an
 increased
 scrutiny
 on


these
 ships.
 These
 American
 and
 Western


insurance
 companies
 are
 yanking


insurance
 away
 from
 these
 ships.
 So
 now


these
 ships
 are
 getting
 insurance
 from


less
 reputable
 companies
 or
 sometimes


even
 companies
 that
 may
 not
 really
 exist


that
 are
 often
 linked
 to
 Russia,
 which


is
 also
 pretty
 scary,
 right?
 Because


let's
 say
 something
 happens
 with
 one
 of


these
 shadow
 fleet
 tankers.
 Who
 the
 hell


is
 going
 to
 pay
 for
 it?


>> Do
 you
 have
 any
 sense,
 Christian,
 as
 to


how
 this
 pressure
 campaign
 on
 the
 shadow


fleet
 might
 end?
 So
 one
 striking
 thing


that
 has
 happened
 after
 Trump
 met
 with


European
 leaders
 at
 Davos
 is
 that
 Macron


tweeted
 and
 said,
 "Hey,
 we
 as
 France


also
 stopped
 and
 boarded
 a
 tanker
 that


was
 carrying
 Russian
 sanctioned
 oil."
 So


that's
 a
 striking
 spillover
 effect
 of


Trump's
 gumpo
 diplomacy
 where
 at least
 a


one-time
 ally,
 France,
 is
 now
 doing
 the


same
 thing
 as
 the
 US
 is
 doing,
 which
 is


stopping
 and
 boarding
 these
 shadow
 fleet


tankers.
 But
 also
 what
 I'm
 looking
 at


right
 now
 is
 at
 a
 completely
 different


side
 of
 the
 world,
 but
 very
 much
 linked,


and
 that's
 Iran.


President
 Donald
 Trump
 is
 ramping
 up


pressure
 on
 Iran.


>> Yeah.
 He
 says
 big
 force
 is
 heading
 to


the
 region
 as
 the
 country
 continues
 to


kill
 protesters
 in
 the
 streets.


>> On
 Thursday
 night,
 Trump
 said
 that
 he's


moving
 an
 armada
 of
 military
 vessels


towards
 the
 region.
 And
 the
 next
 day
 on


Friday,


>> the
 Trump
 administration
 is
 issuing
 new


sanctions
 on
 Iran's
 shadow
 fleet
 of
 oil


vessels
 as
 the
 president
 sends
 Iran
 a


stern
 warning.


>> The
 US
 Treasury
 Department
 announced
 a


new
 set
 of
 sanctions
 specifically


targeting
 oil
 tankers
 because
 the
 US


wants
 to
 put
 more
 pressure
 on
 Iran
 given


their
 crackdown
 on
 the
 anti-government


protests.
 So
 what
 I
 find
 very


interesting
 is
 that
 when
 we
 remember
 how


this
 started
 in
 Venezuela


where
 you
 had
 the
 US
 military
 building


up
 its
 forces
 around
 Venezuela
 and
 the


US
 threatening
 and
 then
 stopping
 and


boarding
 tankers
 linked
 to
 Venezuela's


oil
 trade.
 We
 see
 something
 similar


happening
 with
 Iran
 right
 now.
 The
 US
 is


moving
 its
 military
 vessels
 there.
 We


see
 that
 actually
 happening
 on
 satellite


imagery.
 And
 the
 question
 is
 now
 are
 we


going
 to
 see
 something
 similar
 happening


regarding
 Iran
 as
 what
 we
 saw
 happening


in
 Venezuela.
 Hm.


If
 this
 effort
 to
 stop
 ghost
 fleets
 does


in
 fact
 expand,
 I
 wonder
 how
 much
 that


threatens
 not
 just
 ghost
 fleets,
 but


threatens
 a
 disruption
 of
 the
 global
 oil


market
 generally.
 I
 mean,
 you
 could


imagine
 maybe
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


why
 sanctions
 have
 not
 been
 super
 well


enforced
 before.


>> Totally.
 You
 know,
 Iran
 and
 Russia
 are


reliant
 on
 their
 income
 that
 they
 have


from
 exporting
 their
 oil
 and
 there
 may


be
 less
 shippers
 willing
 to
 transport


their
 oil
 and
 that
 means
 that
 it
 will
 be


harder
 for
 them
 for
 Iran
 and
 for
 Russia


to
 get
 their
 oil
 out
 and
 it
 will
 get


more
 expensive
 to
 get
 that
 oil
 and
 as
 I


said
 before
 like
 China
 and
 also
 India


are
 the
 biggest
 buyers
 of
 this
 Iranian


Russian
 oil
 in
 most
 instances
 and
 will


be
 more
 expensive
 for
 China
 to
 buy
 this


oil.


>> But
 just
 to
 focus
 on
 the
 US
 for
 a


second,
 do
 we
 have
 any
 sense
 of
 how
 any


of
 that
 could
 affect
 oil
 prices
 here


domestically?
 Like
 what
 would
 change
 in


the
 United
 States?


>> The
 global
 oil
 market
 doesn't
 like
 when


there's
 uncertainty.
 So
 each
 time
 a
 ship


is
 getting
 seized,
 there's
 a
 small


uptick
 in
 the
 price
 of
 oil,
 but
 that


kind
 of
 like
 washes
 out
 over
 time.
 And


what
 we
 hear
 Trump
 saying
 is
 that,
 you


know,
 this
 is
 the
 reason
 why
 the
 United


States
 is
 doing
 what
 it's
 doing
 in


Venezuela.
 A
 major
 reason
 is
 the
 oil,
 if


not
 the
 primary
 reason,
 right?
 So
 the


idea
 behind
 that
 from
 a
 Trump


administration
 seems
 to
 be
 we
 want
 to


get
 oil
 prices
 down
 uh
 for
 the
 United


States.
 But
 the
 question
 is
 whether
 that


will
 indeed
 happen.


>> Okay.
 And
 beyond
 the
 impact
 that
 this


all
 might
 have
 on
 the
 global
 oil
 market,


what
 about
 the
 broader
 geopolitical


impacts
 of
 enforcing
 these
 sanctions,


seizing
 these
 oil
 tankers,
 like
 could


the
 countries
 that
 the
 US
 is
 targeting


retaliate
 in
 some
 meaningful
 way?


>> Well,
 I'm
 very
 curious
 what
 is
 the


reaction
 going
 to
 be
 of
 Iran
 and
 Russia?


Because
 so
 far
 they
 haven't
 done
 much


except
 sending
 out
 written
 statements.


It's
 not
 that
 they
 send
 their
 own
 navy


to
 retaliate
 by
 seizing
 uh
 uh
 oil


tankers
 of
 the
 west,
 but
 as
 pressure


increases
 on
 them
 and
 if
 their
 cash
 flow


even
 is
 more
 reduced
 because
 of
 these


actions
 by
 the
 United
 States
 and
 now


also
 by
 France,
 are
 they
 feeling
 they


have
 to
 take
 action
 to
 kind
 of
 get
 their


oil
 moving
 around
 the
 world?


Like
 how
 are
 they
 going
 to
 generate


income
 because
 they
 will
 need
 that
 money


to
 continue
 to
 be
 in
 power?
 And
 if
 the


US
 and
 now
 also
 allies
 of
 the
 US
 are


stopping
 these
 vessels,
 what's
 going
 to


happen?
 So
 the
 question
 of
 how
 these


governments
 are
 going
 to
 survive
 is
 the


main
 question
 on
 my
 mind
 moving
 forward.


>> Christian,
 thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 having
 me.


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


Greg
 Bavino,
 the
 Border
 Patrol
 official


in
 charge
 of
 President
 Trump's


immigration
 enforcement
 in
 Minneapolis,


is
 expected
 to
 leave
 the
 city,
 according


to
 two
 US
 officials.
 The
 decision
 to


move
 him
 out
 came
 days
 after
 he
 made
 the


unsubstantiated
 claim
 that
 Alex
 Prey,


the
 man
 who
 was
 shot
 and
 killed
 by


federal
 agents,
 was
 planning
 to
 quote


massacre
 law
 enforcement
 officers.


Bobino's
 departure
 comes
 as
 President


Trump
 moves
 to
 tamp
 down
 anger
 over
 the


second
 fatal
 shooting
 in
 the
 city.


Trump's
 borders
 are
 Tom
 Hman
 will
 now


direct
 ICE
 operations
 in
 the
 state


and
 Israel
 has
 said
 that
 it's
 recovered


the
 remains
 of
 its
 last
 hostage
 from


Gaza
 on
 Monday.
 It
 paves
 the
 way
 for
 the


next
 phase
 of
 President
 Trump's
 peace


plan
 for
 the
 strip
 which
 calls
 for


Israel
 to
 reopen
 the
 Rafa
 border


crossing
 between
 Gaza
 and
 Egypt.
 That


would
 allow
 Palestinians
 who
 fled
 during


the
 war
 to
 return
 home
 for
 the
 first


time.


Israel
 had
 refused
 to
 reopen
 the
 border


until
 the
 remains
 of
 the
 last
 captive


were
 returned.
