I feel, Tracy, like this conversation
is really about
like the magical object that you don't
you can't look at, right?
Because it'll freeze you.
Or maybe it's the Shining gold
in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction.
You can't see it.
So all we've done historically, mostly, is
we've attempted to figure out what it is
by observing its reflection
onto the world,
which we observe that reflection,
the unemployment.
And now this is an attempt
to see the unseeable and to actually stare
into the abyss at this crucial number
and find out what it truly is.
Everyone's been wondering
what's in the suitcase.
Pulp fiction it was our star.
It was our star all along.
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the All Thoughts podcast.
I'm Tracy Alloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal.
Joe. Yeah.
Yes. Recently? Yes. Recently.
Stephen Myron, who is chair of the Council
of Economic Advisers
and also the newly confirmed
fed board member.
Yeah, he made his first public speech
since joining the central bank.
And you know what it was about?
I do, but go on.
The neutral rate.
The natural rate of interest? Yes.
Our star. Yes.
Basically all about our star, which is
pretty significant for his first speech.
I mean, to me, this has come up
on a bunch of episodes lately.
To me, this is the multi-trillion
dollar question, which is, why is it?
You know what?
We're here.
We're recording to September 24th, 2025.
Why are long term rates so much higher?
Why does the market perceive
that rates will have to be so much higher
in order for the fed to hit its inflation
goals, then, it
then the market perceived in 2019
what changed in the last six years
or five years or whatever?
Well, also, I mean, our star has always
been something of a controversial idea
and people criticize it
for being this unobserved label thing.
Yeah.
You know, it's
a hypothetical estimate that's extracted
from all this different stuff,
like savings and spending and productivity
and demographics investment.
You can go on and on and on.
Climate immigration. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah.
But I think, you know,
our star is probably going
to get even more controversial or perhaps
more under
the spotlight is a way of putting it.
Given that people like Myron in his speech
where he was arguing
that the natural rate of interest
should be zero right now,
which is very, very different than other
sort of normal estimates out there,
which has the natural rate of interest
at like 3.3 or 3.9%, something like that.
And so if you think the neutral rate
of interest is a lot lower,
then then you
would assume that the fed
should be loosening more.
And conversely,
if you think our star is high,
which a lot of people have argued
in recent years, then you would, argue
that the fed you know, interest rates
don't look that restrictive at the moment.
So I'll just say two things.
Probably something of an R star truther
in the specific sense
that I doubt, like, okay, everyone agrees
it's like quote, unobservable, etc.
but I doubt that
there is actually some rate
that will magically
bring the economy into balance.
If we knew what it was.
That doesn't mean I don't find this
to be a conceptually useful conversation.
And yet you don't believe in the term
premium?
I don't really believe in any,
any of this stuff.
No, that's not true.
I am very interested in setting aside
whether something could
theoretically be observed,
whether one number
could bring everything into balance,
all of these things.
Setting aside that question, something is
changed in the underlying economy.
If you want to call that
a neutral rate of interest,
I guess I'm totally fine with that.
But something's
changed and I want to know what it is.
But more importantly,
I want to know why. Okay.
All right, well,
we have the perfect guess.
We're going to be speaking
with Tom Orlik
who is, of course, chief economist
at Bloomberg Economics.
He's been on a number of times before.
And Jamie Rush,
director of global economics at Bloomberg
Economics,
and together with Stephanie Flanders,
who is the head of Bloomberg Economics,
of course, and also the host of the Trump
Enomics podcast, have written a book
all about the new
and a whole book about it.
Yeah, called The Price of Money
A guide to the past, present, and Future
of the Natural Rate of Interest.
Amazing. I'm really excited.
All right, so let's get started.
Tom and Jamie, thank you
so much for coming on. All thoughts.
Great to be here. Thanks, Tracy.
Thanks, Jay.
Thanks for having us.
Well, first of all, congratulations
on the new book.
And I got to say, it's
kind of ballsy to, to tackle
this concept that a lot of people
don't believe in excluding Joe.
And, you know,
that tends to generate a lot of criticism.
And maybe it's even easier
to publish your own model,
so that everyone can see
what the estimates actually are.
I mean, not as a genuine compliment,
but why a book on the neutral rate?
What prompted it?
So I actually recall a tweet from Joe
a while ago.
He took aim at books as a concept.
Oh. Yeah.
So not only do
I not believe in our star or anything,
I don't even believe
in the premise of a book.
No, I do believe in Joe.
It's all book. Should be a tweet. Sorry.
Keep going.
So we've written about a concept
Joe doesn't believe in, in a format
that Joe doesn't support.
So we shouldn't be on this on the podcast.
So why now?
Well, I think there's a couple of, ways
to answer that question.
The first is,
I mean, this is really important, right?
We talk
about the neutral rate of interest.
But really a different way of saying it
is it's the cost of borrowing
in the economy. Right?
And the cost of borrowing
is incredibly consequential.
For ministers of finance, it's
incredibly consequential
for businesses,
for households, for investors.
So it's always a good time to write about
neutral rate, interest
rates, the cost of borrowing.
Why specifically?
No. Well, it's because something
really important has changed,
from the late 1980s to the mid 20 tens.
The global economy was characterized by
too much saving and not enough investment.
And in that state of affairs,
the neutral rate of interest,
the cost of borrowing
was continually falling.
What's happened in the last decade?
Well, that dynamic has swung into reverse.
And now we have less
saving, more investment.
And that means
the neutral rate of interest,
the cost of borrowing for the US Treasury
and for everyone else is going up.
I like this framing.
So it's less about the idea
that there is some rate
that will bring everything
into balance magically, etc.
because I think a lot of people
intuitively understand
why you know that's not so true.
You know, I think that problem
makes a lot of people uncomfortable,
but it is seems objectively true
or real that
the cost of money
or the cost of borrowing has gone up.
And so we can talk about that.
Specifically, let's talk
about the cost of borrowing today
like it is more expensive.
And how much more expensive is it
to borrow money today by some measure,
than it was, say, pre-COVID?
Wait, just before we do this,
can we get like a,
three sentence definition
of how you view our star?
I feel like we should define our terms
before we start.
Excellent idea.
So? So our
star, the natural rate of interest
is what balances
demand for investment
and saving in the economy.
And when those two things are imbalanced,
the economy is on trend
and inflation is roughly at target.
All right.
That's a simple definition. Okay.
I like that.
All right. So why is it going up.
I mean this is the big
this is the big question, right?
But actually, no.
Before we say why is it going up?
How much has it gone up?
Or has it, in fact gone up versus
the pre-COVID environment?
Let's start with that.
Well, if we cast our mind back to that,
that Covid experience,
there was a period
where governments could basically be paid
to borrow in real terms,
interest rates were so low for so long,
so far across the yield curve,
that they could borrow without having
to worry about whether they'd pay it back.
So you can see that the real world
implications of that and the behavior
that we saw during the pandemic,
the borrowing that happened,
is the interest rate
was enormously consequential.
And a big part of that.
We're not in that world now.
Interest rates, Treasury yields
in excess of 4% are much higher,
much more burdensome.
And now we're seeing that the costs of
those policies manifest in budgets today.
So I remember way back
in 2016, Goldman Sachs
put out this note arguing that the fed
had a big new idea to justify
keeping rates low, basically.
And the argument was that
our star was was low.
And so, you know, monetary policy wasn't
actually that that loose at the time.
Even though benchmark rates were already
pretty low and the Goldman analysts
had this chart in their note,
where they basically looked at mentions
of thematic ideas in fed speeches
and press releases and things like that.
And indeed, you could see that
starting in 2016,
mentions of our star start going up.
And, you know, they basically came off
of nothing for like the previous decade,
no one was talking
about the natural rate of interest.
I know our star itself is an old idea,
because I read the book
and there's a chunky chapter
on the history, and development
of the entire concept, but am I right
in thinking that there has been
a resurgence in interest in our star
over the past decade or so?
Chunky seems like a neutral adjective.
Tracy, I like an informative chapter.
I should say.
Okay.
So, I think I think that that clearly has.
Right.
And I think
one of the reasons for that, is
because the state of the world
has changed, right?
In the run
up to the global financial crisis.
I didn't feel like there were sort
of fundamental issues
with how monetary policy was operating.
Right?
Interest rates
moved up, interest rates moved down.
The economy responded in the way which,
the textbooks would suggest.
But in the aftermath
of the financial crisis,
we were in this extended period
of economic malaise.
Right.
And from a monetary policy perspective,
it was hard to explain.
Interest rates were on the floor.
There'd been a huge amount
of quantitative easing.
And yet unemployment rates remain
stubbornly high
growth remained stubbornly low.
Why was that?
And that's one of the reasons
why this neutral rate of interest
rose in profile as an explanatory factor.
Because if the neutral rate of interest
has come down, if it's come down very far,
well, that means the central banks
have to do a lot to stimulate the economy.
And if the neutral rate of interest
is close to zero,
well, that effectively means
that central banks are out of firepower.
They can't take interest rates
low enough to stimulate growth.
This is a very important point actually,
because
and again
just let's stay in the 20 tens here.
When interest rates
were at zero or near zero for a long time,
you probably heard a lot of people
in the financial press say, oh, you know,
the fed is super loose
monetary policy, etc..
How long will the fed continue
to print money or whatever?
And yet, looking at the actual results
in the real economy, as you've described,
unemployment remaining stubbornly
high, inflation consistently
undershooting, which in retrospect,
very nice problem to have.
I think we should have appreciated it
more at the time.
Really not a problem at all in my opinion.
The implication, though,
and we could have understood this from
Milton Friedman and some of his
talk about Japan, was that actually,
implicitly, we were still running tight
monetary policy,
even with nominal rates
basically at their physical floor.
Yeah.
So I so I guess during that period,
interest rates were low, the economy
was failing to gain traction.
And policymakers
were puzzling over it.
And so, so one of the thing and actually
the the puzzle continues, right.
Policymakers still don't know how
restrictive policy is.
They have they
have they infer what they think
the natural rate
should be for by looking around them,
seeing what's happening to unemployment,
see what's happening to inflation.
But they don't know.
And so, well, one of the things that
we did and we tried to achieve in our book
is to rather than inferring
the natural rate of interest,
we looked over a broader sweep of history
and trying to pin down the explanatory
drivers of the rates of interest
to try and get shed some light on
why these things are as they are,
why interest rates fell so much,
why there was an inflection
point around the pandemic, and why
we think interest rates may therefore
go forward, go upwards in the future.
So it was for its thrust,
the exercise the book was really about
trying to pin down the drivers
and then tell a story about those drivers
so we can think about it in the future.
I feel, Tracy, like this
conversation is really about
like the magical object that you don't
you can't look at, right?
Because it'll freeze you.
Or maybe it's the shining gold
in the briefcase in Pulp Fiction.
You can't see it.
So all we've done historically, mostly, is
we've attempted to figure out what it is
by observing its reflection
onto the world,
which we observe that reflection,
the unemployment.
And now this is an attempt
to see the unseeable and to actually stare
into the abyss at this crucial number
and find out what it truly is.
Everyone's been wondering
what's in the suitcase.
Pulp fiction it was our star.
It was our star all along.
Okay.
Well, on that note,
I mean,
I take the point that most of the book
is about the specific drivers of our star.
But you do come up with a model.
And you do come up with an estimate,
for the sort of long
run trajectory of our star.
Can you walk us through
how your model actually differs
from some of the other models out there?
Because I think that might help us
to understand, you know, when people say
this is unobservable
or we're sort of staring at the reflection
of the economy and trying to come up
with this hypothetical, number,
what we're actually doing or what
economists are actually doing.
Yeah.
Of because so the, the conventional way
or least the way that's been
gained a lot of popularity
over the past couple of decades has been
at the Lao back.
And William's model of the natural rate
of interest on neutral rate of interest.
And what they do is they they look at
what's going on with inflation,
what's going on with unemployment.
And they and
they judge, they try to judge from that
how far current interest rates
must be away from the neutral rate.
So if interest rates are very restrictive,
very far away from the neutral rate,
inflation's going to be very low
and unemployment's going to be
very high and vice versa.
And this this has the benefit
of giving you
a feel for what's going on right now
based on observable data.
But it doesn't tell you anything
about why the interest rate is what it is.
Or therefore where it may where it may go.
And so what we tried to do,
was, was pin the, the natural rate down
by using some,
some actual data and some theory.
So if we think about what the natural rate
is, what it is that determines
it, well, it's the price of money,
it's the price and that's determined
by in the same way as anything else, it's
determined, by the supply and the demand.
So on the one
hand, you've got investment demand
and then you've got the supply of savings.
And when these two things move, it
shifts the rate of interest.
And because of that fundamental
theoretical understanding,
you're able to think about, well,
what is it that determines investment?
Why do people want to invest?
Why do people want to save?
What is it about them that or different
types of people or different age people,
that affects their saving behavior.
And so you can
you go from that theory to these drivers
of the,
these theoretical drivers of behavior,
and then you can try
and try and pin it down empirically
and that's exactly what we did.
So we fed into this model,
what economists generally think
are the main drivers
of, of these investment
and saving decisions.
So there were quite a few of them.
And, and then we estimate
their relationship
with the interest rates over the sweep of,
say, 50 years.
And that really is the
that that really was
what supported our results.
And it allows us, of course, then to think
about how those drivers may change.
Just in, keeping in mind Tracy's
mentioned the beginning
of defining terms investment.
Just sort clear.
This is like real investment. Right.
So this is hiring impulse capital expense.
Like what is investment
mean in your terms?
Yeah.
So we're thinking specifically
actually the the the capital expenditure.
Okay. So
I mean let's give
you let's take an example, I
so I, I it's great.
I can't do it on a Casio calculator.
I have to buy something to make it work.
I have to spend money.
I have to invest, in chips in,
in fabs, to reap the benefits
of those frontier technologies.
So as I lift the growth rate of the
of the economy,
it also raises the investment needs.
And so this is the
this is one of the linkages
that we kind of explore is like
what is the relationship between overall
growth in the economy and productivity
growth, the investment need that creates.
And then therefore the the knock
on consequence for interest rates.
So I mean, whether it's
ICT revolution in the 90s,
railroads or
anything else,
these things
all have impacts on investment
and therefore
the natural rates of interest.
And just to define the other term,
when you talk about savings, is this
because it's, you know, in the sense
a savings loan to a bank, etc..
But this is the impulse
to have sort of liquidity, right?
Or at any given moment,
the various actors, the desire
to hold essentially dollar or euro
or whatever liquidity.
Yeah.
That's right. I mean, okay,
I guess you can think about it
on the, the, the individual level.
So I want to save right now
as I get older,
I want to spend those savings
in my retirement.
So that's one of the key drivers
of saving behavior.
China. China used to save a lot.
Now it saves a little, but state actors
also matter to the global supply
of saving, an investment.
So, yes, it's everybody,
and it touches on everything.
Yeah.
One of the light bulb moments for me
reading this book was kind of,
touching the idea of generational warfare
and the idea that
from the 1980s onwards,
baby boomers started saving a lot.
And so the supply of savings went up
and the neutral rate went down.
And that's the reason
why I never earned interest on my bank
account until two years ago.
Okay.
Serious question in your model,
what's the biggest driver
of the neutral rate
actually going up in the future?
Well, then I'm not the main driver.
Really?
Is is this saving by governments
or spending by governments?
So there were a number.
I mean, if you look at the recent past
experience of the pandemic,
if you look at the the path of the deficit
in the US and other countries
since then, what we've learned,
is that governments like to spend
and they have continued to do so
even though, it's become more costly.
And a lot of that reflects, politics.
Politics are fragmented.
It's hard to get support around
closing budget deficits.
And so governments continue to spend,
which is tilting the balance
between investment
and saving in the global economy.
And of course, they have big outlays
coming up.
Defense spending,
is going up in much of the in much the,
the advanced world
and the need to green the energy
infrastructure again
in some parts of the world is also,
crimping, saving.
And then just that fundamental point
that you've got
aging populations, increasing outlays for,
for dealing with that on health,
for dealing with that on,
on, on benefits and pensions.
All of this is just making it
very difficult to keep spending down.
I think this it also intersects,
with the argument which you, kicked off
with Joe and Tracy, from Steven.
Myron.
So, Steven, Myron.
The new fed governor, has made the case
that, the policies from the Trump
administration,
are going to have a big negative impact
on the neutral rate of interest.
And that's
why he's advocating for very aggressive,
rate cuts, to keep policy accommodative.
Now, the argument we make in our book,
actually, points
in the opposite direction, right.
If you think about the policies
of the Trump administration,
well, firstly, we've got the one
big beautiful bill, which adds trillions
and trillions of dollars to government
borrowing over the next decade.
That significantly pushes up
the neutral rate of interest.
And if you think more broadly about Trump
policies, well,
it's kind of the end of the grand bargain
which America has struck with the world.
Right?
One way of thinking about the last
few decades is America said to the world,
we will buy your stuff and we will
defend you, but you have to finance us.
You have to send your savings
to the United States, buy US treasuries.
But what the Trump administration
now is saying is, well,
we're not going to buy your stuff
and we're not going to defend you.
Right.
So it wouldn't be that surprising
if the rest of the world said, well,
if you're not going to buy our stuff,
then you're not going to defend us.
We're not going to finance you any more.
Right.
So Stephen, Myron, who's
a super smart, super articulate guy,
and if you've not had him on Odd Lots
already, we have, we have.
And we'll have them again sometime.
Fan favorite episode makes the case.
Makes the case that the Trump
administration has significantly lowered
the neutral rate of interest.
And that's
why the fed needs to aggressively,
the model which Jamie
developed the argument, weaken our book
actually points in the opposite direction.
Yeah.
On this note, do you get the sense that
central bankers, policymakers, economists
sometimes use our star as a crutch
to justify whatever they're doing?
Like if you think rates should be lower,
then you can just argue
that our star is in fact, low.
And our star is this unobservable thing
that's based on your own estimates.
So you can argue about it.
But no one's ever going to prove
what our star actually is.
And if you think that rate
should be higher,
then you just argue that, well, actually
something has structurally changed,
and the natural rate of interest
is in fact quite high.
Do people use it in that way?
It feels like it.
Well,
one thing I suppose is that with our star,
you're never beholden to a prediction.
Really?
So if you say
I think interest rates should be lower
because the economy is going to tank
and then the economy doesn't tank
you just like a bit of an idiot.
But if you say,
I think rate should be lower
because our star is actually lower
than no one's ever going to say,
oh, actually, you are completely wrong,
because I've got irrefutable proof
that our star was actually,
in fact, higher.
So I think it's probably a safe way to
to express your views
if you just have a belief, an inner belief
that rates need to be lower.
But it is perhaps one
that's less easy to hold to account
when we talk about Trump policies
and their effect on our star.
Another thing that I think about a lot is,
you do talk about this
grand bargain falling apart.
The trade and every country
wanting to be increasingly
more self-sufficient in various goods,
which strikes me
as something that once again
adds to the investment impulse.
The US is worried that maybe one day we
won't be able to rely on Taiwan for chips.
Europe might be worried
that if the EU, that the US
may not be a great supplier for whatever
the US supplies to Europe, etc.,
does this sort of fracturing of global
trade, which may or may not be happening,
contribute to a positive investment
impulse in a sense,
and therefore, raise our star?
Yeah, I think there's a couple of dynamics
at work there, Joe.
So the first one is the one you mentioned.
If everyone
wants to make their own stuff at home,
then clearly there has to be
a massive amount of capital spending
so everyone can build their own
everything, right?
We can't just have semiconductor fabs
in Taiwan.
We need semiconductor fabs
in Germany and Japan.
And the United States.
And that means there needs to be much
more investment spending.
The second dynamic, and this is something
which one of our coauthors,
Dan Hanson, gets into, in
the book, is around,
globalization
and the cost of investment goods.
Right.
Think about how much more computing power
you get for your money today
than you did in 1980.
Right?
There's just been a massive increase
in productivity.
A massive increase
in the amount of computing power
you get for a certain amount of money.
And that means you don't have to spend
as much, in order to buy investment goods.
Well, if globalization now breaks down
and we come to the end of that kind of
productivity miracle in technology, well,
that means that the cost of investment
goods is going to stop falling.
You're going to need to pay more
to buy a certain
amount of technology,
a certain amount of investment goods.
And that is also going to be a factor
pushing up the natural rate.
So on a related note, I mean,
we we have had a number of supply shocks
in recent years.
You know, during the pandemic,
during the Russian invasion
of Ukraine, all that stuff
which has led a lot of governments
to start thinking about how to solve
these sort of choke points
or shortages in the system.
What does that actually mean
for central bank policy?
If, you know, perhaps
the neutral rate of interest is going up
because of these supply shocks,
because you need more investment.
But at the same time, the central bank
raising rates doesn't necessarily produce
more wheat or more shipping capacity
and things like that.
How should central banks respond?
Well,
there are obviously going to be periods,
where inflation just moves higher.
Because because of the supply shocks
you mentioned, I think,
and we should expect those to happen
with increasing frequency.
Right.
So climate change is going to make it
harder to, to produce stuff.
It's going to make feed price shocks more,
more common.
It's going to create other distortions
which will hit production.
So central banks of the future
will perhaps have to keep
interest rates
higher anyway, just to kind of prevent
those shocks from feeding through
to inflation expectations.
And therefore,
keeping inflation away from targets
is because supply shocks really
are very different from demand shocks,
as you guys know I'm sure.
And but,
you know, history was was dominated,
at least in the last couple of decades
by demand shocks.
And, and now we're seeing a world which is
dominated increasingly by spy shocks.
And actually it's just
a different playbook for central banks.
I agree with all of that.
I think there's other
there's another dynamic for central banks,
which is also going to be,
a force
for higher interest rates, going forwards.
And that's the challenge to central bank
independence.
Right.
We've talked about, Steven, Myron coming
on to the board of governors at the fed.
Well, guess what?
He's still holding onto his position.
As the chair of the Council of Economic
Advisers, senior member of Donald Trump's,
economic policy team,
having someone from the president's team
serve on the fed concurrently.
That's unprecedented going back to 1936.
And raises significant questions
about fed independence.
And so the Fed's credibility as
an inflation is as an inflation fighter.
Right.
Now, we've not really seen this in markets
so far.
Markets have been paying surprisingly
little attention, to this dynamic.
But if the fed does lose its independence,
if the fed does lose its credibility
as an inflation fighter,
then markets are going to start demanding
an additional premium,
to hold long term U.S.
Treasury debt. Right.
So you're going to have all
of these structural forces,
less saving, more investment.
You're going to have the greater
preponderance of supply shocks,
which Jamie spoke about is
an additional driver of higher inflation.
And you're going to have risks
to fed independence.
And all of these are forces
which are going to be pushing up.
Yeah.
Long term
borrowing costs for the U.S. Treasury.
And because the Treasury rate
is the anchor for global
markets, also pushing up
borrowing costs for everybody else.
I'm glad you brought this up,
because even setting aside
the sort of formal risks to fed
independence,
there are others who question the degree
to which the fed
still takes its own 2% inflation
targeting, target seriously,
including our own colleague here,
and one who says implicitly,
if you look at what's going on,
it looks like
they're no longer targeting 2%.
They're targeting 2.8%.
Tim. Julie, an economist we've had says,
you know what?
As long as inflation is below 3%,
we think the fed
is mostly concerned
about the labor side of the mandate.
So setting aside Myron's role or Trump's
truth social posts,
when you look at market,
is there the sort of growing belief
that the fed just does
not take 2% as seriously as once it did?
Yeah.
So it's a powerful argument,
which Ana, our chief U.S.
economist,
makes, and, part of that argument
is that, this divergence between
what the fed should be doing
if they take 2% inflation seriously
and what they're actually doing,
didn't start under Trump.
It started under Biden.
And actually,
it was those rate cuts in the run
up to the 2024 election,
which were the beginning
of the fed, diverging from a kind of pure,
apolitical Taylor rule path.
Right.
So, as I'm sure you've seen,
Joe and Tracy,
there's not much,
which Republicans and Democrats agree on.
In America right now.
One point of bipartisan consensus,
unfortunately,
is that there's too much politics
in the fed.
Tracy.
So one once told me that the two things
that everyone agrees on, by the way,
in America, are that,
Dolly Parton is
good and that Epstein didn't kill himself.
We can add a third, that there is too much
politics in monetary policy making.
So the three points of,
bipartisan agreement, that's going to be
my new conversation
starter at dinner is for everyone.
Just ask them
if they think there's too much politics.
In fed policy. Okay.
Joe mentioned markets just then.
So I think when people think of the era
of low interest rates,
and low natural rates, people
think about high asset prices, right?
There tends to be a correlation there.
If the price of money is going up,
what does that actually mean for asset
prices.
Well, I it kind of depends on the reason.
And as we sort of talked about earlier
about the kind of role of I well, I,
I can raise equity values
because it's a frontier technology
that's going to potentially transform
the way the economy operates and create
lots of profits along the way.
It can it's
also going to suck in a load of capital,
and make it less available for others,
which is going to drive up interest rates.
So if that's the source,
you can see this world continuing.
You can see that interest rates
will continue to rise as investments
are sucked into the AI nexus.
But the if sounds the
the actual promise is realized.
You see equity values going up as well,
which is kind of a
slightly unusual arrangement.
But then we don't have
technological revolutions every day.
I'm glad you brought up a
because I wanted to go there.
You know, I've seen, Jason Furman.
He is characterized AI spending as being
almost quasi fiscal in nature
because it has this there's not that
we haven't got the productivity
pay off yet, but there is this incredible
flood of money coming in.
So it sort of has this perhaps
crowding out effect.
Neel Kashkari gave a interesting, posted
and I guess it was a blog post
called three Questions.
I think you posted it last week,
but he talks about our star
and he about how this higher neutral
rate of interest
may be appropriate
given the given the intense pace of,
AI investment that's going on.
But also it may not be appropriate,
you know, for the housing sector, the,
that's not what bring into balance.
And we see this decline.
Could there be to our stars,
could there be this,
our star, that sort of the high tech
economy booming?
But it's not a it's
not the our star that brings
the rest of the economy into balance.
It's a it's a good question, Jay.
And I think people do
think about this concept,
quite a lot in the sense that there's a
maybe there's an all star
which keeps the economy balanced,
and maybe there's an all star
which keeps the financial sector
and financial markets balanced
and not getting carried away
with themselves.
And there's no guarantee
or any particular reason
to think that they should be the same,
which implies then, that you've got this
policy trade off, you've got you.
What's good for the economy may not be
good for, for financial stability.
And so that's, that's another thing
for central banks
to be grappling
with in the, in the years to come.
When it
comes to the composition of investment,
one topic that, gets a lot of attention
nowadays is the idea of dollarization.
And perhaps people buying fewer U.S
assets per perhaps
people, you know,
had choosing to hedge those U.S assets.
And we have seen
some very big buyers, of securities
like foreign central banks
actually slow down their purchases of U.S.
treasuries or U.S mortgage bonds
and things like that.
How would that affect
the neutral rate of interest if you know
there's less money flowing into dollars
specifically, or dollar assets?
So I think there's a number of reasons
why we would expect less money
flowing into dollars. Right.
So one really big reason, is
that China has changed its FX policy.
For, more than a decade, China
was pegging the yuan to the dollar,
and that meant the PBoC
needed to hoover up the whole trade
surplus and park that in treasuries
to stop the yuan appreciating.
The second big important reason,
is that shift in the grand bargain
between the US and the rest of the world.
Think about how,
the US and Europe acted to freeze Russia's
FX reserves following, Putin's,
full scale invasion of Ukraine.
That's a kind of shift
in the grand bargain.
And it tells Russia,
but also everybody else.
Guess what?
There's geopolitics in the dollar, right?
And if you put your assets
in the United States,
there's a risk you might lose them.
And of course, the tariffs
themselves are a factor.
That huge hike in tariffs
that we saw on Liberation Day.
Well that's the US saying
we're going to play a smaller part
in the global trade system in the future.
And if the US is going to play
a smaller part in the global trade system.
Well, the utility of holding dollars
as a way of settling import
and export transactions goes down.
So there's a lot of reasons to be
concerned about this dollarization trend.
And, Jamie may have
a more sophisticated way
of thinking about this, this than me.
But basically,
I think about buying dollars and buying
treasuries is pretty strongly
correlated in this context.
So if the rest of the world
is the dollar rising, that also means
they're buying less U.S. treasuries.
That means less demand
for U.S. treasuries.
And so it's another force
pushing us borrowing costs higher.
I think all that is
and that was all entirely true.
I and I guess one thing
when you're trying to think next to the
the linkage with global
borrowing costs is,
is what happens to those,
those savings instead.
Now if you can't find anywhere else
any other assets to buy in place of U.S.
treasuries, what are you going to do?
Well, quite possibly
you end up spending them.
And particularly
you think about the geopolitical context.
You think about the impact of tariffs
on China, for example,
when I was actually an extra
incentive to spend more.
And if you think about in those terms,
then actually that
that policy itself is going to shift
the international balance of investment.
And saving,
again, away from saving is partly
because it's just too, too hard to save me
anywhere safe.
My computer, just for the Air Force
reboot.
I had a great chart on my screen,
but now I can't look at it.
But, December 27th
or whatever
the last day of trading was in 2019,
the US ten year was about 1.8, and today
it's probably like 1.12%.
Maybe both of you get list
your five reasons in order.
I know this the ten year is not the
our star, but you know for our purposes
for for podcast talk we could just
sort of our star is everywhere.
Yeah like
and maybe ranked the five for both of you
in order rank the five major things
or however many you on to
that have contributed
most significantly to this,
regime change or price change.
Maybe I'll take the easy ones, of course.
So here's my here's my three.
So firstly, it's demographics.
For decades we had the baby boomers
in prime working age
saving money for retirement.
That pushed the neutral rate down.
Now they're retiring,
spending down their savings.
That's a powerful force
pushing the neutral rate up.
Second is that, for decades,
from the 1980s to the global
financial crisis, borrowing from the US
and from other major advanced economies,
leaving aside,
Japan, was low and stable,
since the global financial crisis
and again, since the Covid pandemic,
there's been a massive increase
in government borrowing.
And when there's more government
borrowing,
that pushes
the natural rate of interest higher.
And then the third, the globalization.
So one of the factors
driving neutral rates lower
was that Ben Bernanke savings
glut hypothesis.
Yeah.
Chinese saving Petra saving from Saudi
and others heading into the United States.
The forces of globalization
have now brought that to an end.
So conveniently, 3DS demographics,
d globalization
all pushing neutral rates higher.
Very good.
Jamie, you have to beat that now.
I'm. I think I only had one extra,
to be honest
and that's I so when we, when we were
putting pen to paper for the book,
ChatGPT wasn't really a thing.
That's when we started out.
By the time we published the book, it's
very much a thing.
And we can already see that the,
the transformational impact
that's having on the investment landscape,
whether it has a transformational impact
on the economic landscape,
remains to be seen.
But I think that is now playing out
faster than we thought.
We had a scenario in our book, about what
that could do to the natural rate.
No surprise, it pushes it up.
And I think we're actually in a world
now with that scenario is basically coming
to pass.
I'm going to help everyone out here
with a little bit of marketing.
So, Tom, you mentioned the 3DS,
debt demographics.
D globalization,
I we can rebrand as data centers.
So that's the fourth D
and then the fifth one,
which you guys talked about,
but you didn't hit your list.
And that is defense spending. Yeah.
So really we can talk about the five five.
Is that demographics D globalization data
centers
and defense as having contributed this
we've come to something
we could really market this
I think the four of us together,
the five DS that have caused
the price of money to get so much higher
in the last six years, well,
that can be the next book.
Yeah.
Although the current one talks a lot
about all of these, obviously,
I think there could be the,
the title to this episode,
the five DS, the five DS,
the pushing up the price of money.
Yeah, yeah, that would work.
Okay.
Well, on that note, Tom and Jamie,
thank you so much for joining
our thoughts. Really appreciate it.
Thank you so much for having us do, Tracy.
Always a blast.
Thank you so much.
That was great pleasure. Thanks, guys.
Thank you Joe. That was very fun.
Always a fun time having our Bloomberg
Economics colleagues on the podcast.
I think, our star filled
I believe in it now.
I believe that there are some number
that if only we could stare at it
directly, we could kind of
bring things into balance.
I think it's a useful concept.
Yeah, for sure.
And it's something to aim for,
and it's kind of a framework under which,
like an umbrella under
which you can put all your thoughts
about the economy, basically.
That said,
and I mean, Tom and Jamie and Stephanie
lay out a very convincing argument
for why they think our star
is going to be higher in the future.
Meanwhile, you have people like Myron.
Yeah, arguing the exact opposite.
We can debate whether it's
convincing or not, but it does feel like
our star is not a method of achieving
consensus.
Let's
just put it that way. No, it's not, but,
and to your point,
anyone, if you can't make an argument
for either our star
going higher or lower in the future,
it's like an intelligence test.
Any intelligent person
should be able to argue both sides.
Yeah, exactly.
Exactly right.
You can always come up with an eloquent,
nice sounding argument for any direction.
This is true.
The one thing I'll say is that while
our star may not truly be observable,
etc., and maybe there isn't one number
that satisfies the whole economy,
what's that line?
It's like all models are fake,
but some are at least useful.
It strikes me that it may be
a fake concept, but a useful concept,
and that plugging some of these factors
in, what can we anticipate
about
where defense spending is going to go?
What can we anticipate
about the nature of savings
or savings or spending decisions
among an aging population?
These are useful things
to try to wrap our head around it.
And maybe these could be
this could be a useful exercise,
even if the underlying concept
is still like a little,
yeah, except that a lot of people argue
that the models are garbage to know.
Of course, except for this one, obviously.
Of course, that was argued for everything,
but I'm just saying, like,
I mean, you just go total nihilist
and think that the profession of economics
is nonsense, but, but it does strike me
as useful to say there is going to be
a lot more spending here
because real reasons that are happening.
What is that going to do
to the availability of money or capital?
Yeah, whatever. I think that makes sense.
Although one thing I would like to see
more study of is like, maybe not,
not necessarily our star
and whether it's too high or too low,
but like the actual impact
of interest rates on economic growth,
like the sensitivity, you know, of growth
to rates is a great question.
And that's, I think, one of the other big
sort of mysteries
of the last several years. Yeah.
Which is how do you get
the biggest interest rate hike in decades.
And the growth trajectory barely budged,
and the unemployment
or the employment trajectory, barely.
Budges.
These are like things, you know,
I think a lot of people would have thought
in retrospect, oh, we're definitely going
to go to recession
with this rapid pace of rate
hikes, the degree to which
policy actually affects the real economy
in predictable ways.
Highly, highly contested.
Yeah.
Well, maybe that can be Tom
and Jamie's next book. Yeah.
Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
All right.
