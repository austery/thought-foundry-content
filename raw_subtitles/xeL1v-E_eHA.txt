From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Bavaro.
 This
 is
 the
 daily.


[music]
 Today,
 the
 story
 of
 how
 the


fallout
 from
 Alex
 Py's
 [music]
 death


forced
 President
 Trump
 to
 change
 course


in
 Minneapolis
 and
 the
 [music]
 debate


over
 whether
 those
 changes
 are
 real
 or


merely
 symbolic.
 I
 spoke
 with
 White


House
 reporters
 [music]
 Zolan
 Kano


Youngs
 and
 Tyler
 Pager.


[music]


It's
 Wednesday,
 January
 28th.


Zolan
 and
 Tyler,
 we
 are
 having
 this


conversation
 with
 you
 on
 Tuesday


afternoon
 at
 this
 moment
 when
 President


Trump
 has
 clearly
 decided
 to
 try
 to


telegraph
 that
 he
 wants
 to
 change
 course


or
 at least
 change
 the
 tone
 around
 his


administration's
 immigration
 crackdown


in
 Minneapolis
 following
 the
 killing
 of


Alex
 Prey
 and
 all
 of
 the
 outrage
 it


inspired.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 talk
 about


how
 meaningful
 or
 superficial
 that


change
 really
 is.
 But
 Tyler,
 let's
 first


talk
 through
 what's
 actually
 happened


behind
 the
 scenes
 in
 the
 days
 since


Freddy's
 death.


>> So
 Michael,
 one
 of
 the
 interesting


things
 just
 about
 this
 weekend
 is
 that


it's
 one
 of
 the
 rare
 weekends
 in
 the


winter
 where
 Donald
 Trump
 is
 in


Washington
 and
 not
 in
 Palm
 Beach,


Florida
 at
 his
 club
 and
 residence,
 Mara


Lago.
 M


>> and
 the
 reason
 that
 Trump
 stayed
 in


Washington
 was
 because
 he
 was
 hosting
 a


special
 premiere
 at
 the
 White
 House
 for


the
 new
 documentary
 about
 his
 wife


Melania.


>> Right.


>> And
 so
 the
 president
 is
 spending
 a
 lot


of
 the
 weekend
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office
 and
 in


the
 dining
 room
 off
 the
 Oval
 Office


watching
 media
 coverage
 of
 what's
 going


on
 in
 Minneapolis
 and
 the
 shooting
 of


Alex
 Prey.
 He
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 time


watching
 Fox
 News
 but
 flips
 around


channels.
 Another
 American
 citizen
 has


been
 shot
 dead
 by
 federal
 agents
 in


Minneapolis.
 The
 Trump
 administration
 is


defending
 the
 agent's
 actions
 this
 week.


>> And
 just
 saw
 this
 caffany
 of
 voices


criticizing
 the
 response
 and
 the
 killing


of
 this
 man
 in
 Minneapolis.


>> It
 should
 freak
 the
 American
 public
 out


that
 the
 Trump
 administration


lies
 this
 easily.
 will
 lie
 to
 your
 face


when
 you
 can
 see
 the
 evidence
 for


yourself.


>> He
 was
 called
 by
 the
 Trump


administration
 officials
 a
 domestic


terrorist
 when
 all
 he
 had
 in
 his
 hand


was
 a
 cell
 phone.


>> Americans
 don't
 like
 what
 they're
 seeing


right
 now.
 Nobody
 likes
 feds
 coming
 into


their
 state.
 And
 so
 what's
 the
 goal


right
 now?


>> [music]


>> And
 this
 criticism
 is
 notable
 and
 rare


because
 it's
 not
 just
 Democrats
 and
 it's


not
 the
 usual
 loudest
 critics
 in
 the


Republican
 party
 that
 are
 pushing
 back


on
 him.


>> Senator
 Bill
 Cassidy
 calling
 the


situation
 disturbing,
 writing,
 "The


credibility
 of
 ICE
 in
 DHS
 are
 at
 stake."


Senator,


>> you've
 got
 Senator
 Bill
 Cassidy
 who
 said


on
 social
 media
 that
 the
 shooting
 was


incredibly
 disturbing.
 Tom
 Tillis
 called


for
 an
 investigation
 as
 well.
 That's


notable
 push
 back
 against
 this
 White


House,
 particularly
 a
 White
 House
 that


demands
 loyalty
 from
 its
 party.
 And


beyond
 the
 Republican
 lawmakers,
 even


some
 sympathetic
 media
 figures
 like
 Fox


News
 hosts
 Trey
 Gaudy
 and
 Maria
 Barto


were
 also
 criticizing
 the
 rhetoric
 from


senior
 administration
 officials.


>> Well,
 you
 you've
 collected
 the
 evidence,


you
 said,
 right?
 You
 have
 the
 handgun
 in


your
 possession.


>> That's
 right.


And
 and
 how
 was
 he
 using
 that
 handgun
 in


terms
 of
 threatening
 Border
 Patrol?
 What


was
 the
 threat?
 He
 had
 his
 camera,


right?
 He
 was
 filming
 it.


[music]


>> And
 Michael,
 that's
 to
 say
 nothing
 of


what
 Trump
 would
 have
 seen
 if
 he
 tuned


into
 MS
 Now
 or
 CNN.


>> What
 do
 you
 see
 when
 you
 watch
 those


videos?


>> An
 execution.
 An
 absolute
 execution.
 He


There's
 no
 Every
 angle
 shows
 it.
 and


they
 continued
 to
 fire
 bullets
 at
 him


while
 his
 body
 was
 lifeless
 on
 the


ground


>> where
 officials
 were
 saying
 that
 the


government
 basically
 gunned
 down
 this


man
 and
 bungled
 the
 response
 [music]


>> evidence.
 The
 lies
 do
 more
 than
 mislead.


They
 justify
 the
 unjustifiable
 and
 in


the
 absence
 of
 accountability
 from
 the


Department
 of
 Homeland
 Security,
 from


ICE,
 from
 Customs
 and
 Border
 Protection,


it
 is
 up
 to
 us
 to
 hold
 on
 to
 the
 truth.


>> [music]


>> Right.
 I
 caught
 some
 of
 that
 coverage


and
 it
 was
 basically
 the
 government
 has


murdered
 this
 man
 and
 then


systematically
 lied
 about
 what
 happened


in
 the
 face
 of
 video
 that
 very
 clearly


contradicted
 it.


>> Absolutely,
 Michael.
 And
 what
 the


president
 was
 concerned
 about
 was
 not


necessarily
 the
 incident
 itself.
 You


know,
 he
 was
 disturbed
 that
 a
 man
 had


been
 killed.
 But
 Michael,
 what
 he
 was


really
 worried
 about
 was
 that
 this


chaos,
 this
 narrative
 was
 overshadowing


all
 of
 the
 progress
 he
 felt
 he
 has
 made


on
 the
 issue
 of
 immigration
 enforcement


and
 the
 border
 with
 Mexico.
 These
 are


issues
 that
 are
 core
 to
 his
 political


identity.
 And
 the
 president
 was
 talking


to
 aids
 and
 allies
 throughout
 the


weekend
 and
 venting
 about
 how
 the


narrative
 was
 being
 overtaken
 by
 this


use
 of
 force
 and
 by
 the
 killing
 of
 a
 man


and
 it
 was
 distracting
 from
 the
 message


that
 he
 wanted
 to
 be
 driving
 home
 which


was
 that
 he
 had
 sealed
 the
 border
 and
 he


was
 getting
 rid
 of
 in
 his
 parliament
 the


most
 violent
 undocumented
 immigrants
 in


the
 country.


>> And
 when
 did
 we
 start
 to
 see
 him


reacting
 accordingly?
 Late
 Sunday
 night,


an
 interview
 with
 the
 Wall
 Street


Journal
 published
 with
 President
 Trump


in
 which
 he
 made
 somewhat
 measured


comments
 for
 him.
 He
 actually
 expressed


a
 willingness
 in
 an
 investigation
 into


this
 shooting
 and
 said
 that
 his


administration
 was
 reviewing
 the


shooting
 and
 that
 eventually
 they
 would


come
 out
 determination.
 These
 comments


are
 starkly
 different
 from
 the
 way
 the


president
 was
 talking
 about
 this


shooting
 even
 just
 24
 hours
 before.


Right.
 Right.
 In
 the
 initial
 aftermath,


President
 Trump
 once
 again
 laid
 blame
 on


the
 victim.
 He
 attacked
 local
 leaders
 in


Minnesota.
 Now
 he's
 coming
 out
 and


actually
 saying
 that
 they
 want
 to
 take
 a


look
 at
 this.
 That
 is
 really
 different


than
 the
 usual
 reactionary
 defense
 we


see
 from
 President
 Trump
 when
 it
 comes


to
 anything
 really
 involving
 ICE
 or
 his


immigration
 agenda.


>> Right.
 And
 it
 turns
 out
 that
 ends
 up


Tyler
 being
 kind
 of
 just
 the
 beginning


of
 a
 pretty
 public
 pivot
 that
 I
 wonder


if
 you
 can
 keep
 describing
 here.
 Yeah,


it
 starts
 very
 early
 Monday
 morning
 when


the
 president
 announces
 on
 True
 Social


that
 he's
 sending
 in
 Tom
 Hman,
 the
 White


House
 borders
 are
 from
 Washington
 to


Minneapolis
 to
 lead
 the
 operation.
 And
 a


few
 hours
 later,
 we
 learned
 that
 Greg


Bevino,
 a
 top
 border
 patrol
 official
 who


had
 been
 leading
 these
 operations
 all


over
 the
 country,
 would
 be
 leaving


Minneapolis.
 And
 it's
 a
 clear
 sign
 that


changes
 are
 underway
 at
 least
 in
 terms


of
 personnel
 in
 response
 to
 this


horrible
 killing.


>> And
 the
 Bavino
 departure,
 just
 to
 linger


on
 that
 for
 a
 minute,
 feels
 especially


notable
 because
 he
 had
 literally
 been
 on


the
 ground
 in
 Minneapolis
 very


unapologetically


defending
 the
 most
 aggressive
 tactics


that
 ICE
 and
 Border
 Patrol
 were
 using.


And
 because
 he
 had
 told
 the
 public


something
 that
 turned
 out
 to
 be


completely
 wrong
 about
 Alex
 Prey
 and


about
 his
 intent
 and
 his
 actions
 that


was
 very
 much
 contradicted
 by
 the
 videos


that
 emerged.
 And
 so
 suddenly
 it
 felt


like
 there
 were
 consequences
 for
 that


conduct.


>> Absolutely,
 Michael.
 And
 I
 think
 you


know
 it
 wasn't
 just
 Bovino
 who
 was


spreading
 these
 false
 messages
 about


Freddy.
 They
 were
 echoed
 by
 Christine


Nome,
 the
 Secretary
 of
 Homeland


Security,
 Steven
 Miller,
 a
 senior


adviser
 in
 the
 White
 House,
 who
 is
 the


architect
 of
 much
 of
 Trump's
 immigration


agenda.
 And
 the
 president
 was
 distancing


himself
 from
 those
 exact
 messages.
 He


was
 not
 saying
 that
 Prey
 was
 a
 domestic


terrorist,
 as
 Steven
 Miller
 said.
 And
 he


also
 was
 not
 saying
 that
 Freddy
 was
 an


assassin
 who
 was
 trying
 to
 inflict
 mass


harm
 on
 Border
 Patrol
 agents
 as


Christine
 Gnome
 suggested
 and
 Bouvino


did
 as
 well.
 And
 so
 those
 individuals


who
 were
 really
 spreading
 the
 most


inaccurate
 messages
 about
 the
 victim


were
 sort
 of
 being
 pushed
 aside.
 And
 on


top
 of
 that
 deciding
 to
 to
 pull
 back


Greg
 Pavino,
 we
 also
 hear
 that
 President


Trump
 is
 having
 these
 phone
 calls
 with


Governor
 Tim
 Waltz
 and
 uh
 the
 mayor
 of


Minneapolis
 as
 well,
 Jacob
 Fry.
 This
 is


also
 pretty
 remarkable.
 Just
 a
 couple


days
 earlier,
 President
 Trump
 was


attacking
 these
 same
 officials,
 blaming


them
 for
 the
 unrest
 that
 we
 are
 seeing


in
 Minneapolis.


>> Right.
 In
 fact,
 his
 Department
 of


Justice
 is
 actively
 investigating
 both


of
 them
 criminally
 for
 blocking
 his


immigration
 crackdown.
 But
 suddenly,


he's
 having
 what
 by
 all
 accounts,
 I


think,
 are
 somewhat
 diplomatic
 phone


calls
 with


>> He
 doesn't
 just
 talk
 to
 them,
 he
 also


describes
 it
 kind
 of
 positively
 as
 well.


>> Mhm.
 And
 based
 on
 the
 readouts
 from
 the


calls,
 Michael,
 it
 seems
 that
 they


really
 did
 get
 into
 some
 substantive


issues.


>> But
 I
 had
 two
 very
 good
 talks.
 I
 had


Jacob
 Fry
 and
 I
 had
 Governor
 Wals.
 And
 I


mean
 they
 were
 they
 were
 great
 calls.
 So


>> as
 you
 know
 the
 president
 made
 clear


that
 he
 wanted
 to
 enhance
 cooperation


between
 state
 and
 local
 officials
 with


federal
 officials
 on
 the
 ground
 and
 the


Democratic
 leaders
 also
 pushed
 back.


>> First
 of
 all,
 I
 I
 asked
 that
 we
 have
 a


fair
 and
 independent
 um
 investigation


into
 the
 murder
 of
 both
 Renee
 Good
 and


Alex.
 um
 and
 uh
 that
 we
 have
 to
 be
 able


to
 do
 that
 and
 and
 he
 said
 I
 we'll
 we'll


look
 at
 that.
 We'll
 we'll
 take
 a
 look
 at


that.


>> They
 said
 they
 wanted
 a
 real


investigation
 into
 the
 shootings
 of


Minneapolis
 residents
 and
 also
 an


readout
 from
 Tim
 Walls's
 office
 said


that
 the
 president
 agreed
 to
 look
 into


reducing
 the
 number
 of
 federal
 agents
 in


Minnesota.


>> He
 pledged
 that
 look,
 I'm
 going
 to
 send


Tom
 Holman
 in.
 We'll
 do
 things


differently.
 And
 really
 what
 it
 seems,


Michael,
 is
 that
 both
 sides
 had
 an


opportunity
 to
 raise
 their
 own


grievances
 and
 maybe
 had
 some


breakthroughs,


>> right?
 And
 so
 it
 felt
 by
 Tuesday


afternoon
 that
 we
 ended
 up
 in
 a


situation
 that
 we've
 become
 kind
 of


familiar
 with
 in
 the
 Trump
 presidency,


which
 is
 the
 administration


has
 gone
 too
 far.
 People
 are
 furious.
 I


mean,
 our
 our
 colleagues
 described
 this


as,
 and
 I'm
 going
 to
 quote
 from
 them,


one
 of
 the
 gravest
 political
 threats
 to


Trump
 since
 his
 inauguration
 in
 this


second
 term.
 And
 the
 president,
 based
 on


everything
 you're
 describing
 here,
 seems


to
 understand
 that
 and
 wants
 to
 say
 in


his
 own
 way,
 I
 get
 it
 and
 I'm
 ready
 to


try
 to
 diffuse
 this.


>> Michael,
 that's
 right.
 And
 I
 mean,
 just


to
 that
 point,
 as
 we're
 speaking
 to
 you


right
 now,
 the
 president
 just
 told
 Fox


News
 that
 his
 administration
 was
 going


to
 work
 on
 deescalating
 a
 little
 bit
 the


situation
 in
 Minneapolis.
 But
 not
 a


Trump
 word,
 not
 a
 word
 you
 often
 hear


from
 this
 president.
 Uh,
 but
 look,
 I


guess
 that's
 the
 big
 question
 we
 have


now
 moving
 forward.
 [music]


Are
 these
 just
 words?
 You
 know,
 is
 this


just
 lip
 service
 at
 this
 point
 in
 the


response
 to
 intense
 political
 backlash


>> or
 are
 we
 uh
 in
 the
 midst
 here
 of
 a
 real


moment
 where
 we
 could
 see
 concrete


change
 on
 the
 ground
 when
 it
 comes
 to


these
 kind
 of
 federal
 crackdowns
 on


American
 cities.
 [music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


So
 Tyler
 Enzo,
 let's
 further
 pursue
 the


question
 posed
 right
 before
 the
 break,


which
 is
 amid
 all
 these
 signals
 and


symbols
 of
 some
 sort
 of
 a
 change
 in


course
 and
 tone
 from
 the
 president,
 has


anything
 actually
 changed
 on
 the
 ground


in
 Minneapolis
 where
 ICE
 and
 the
 Border


Patrol
 are
 still
 very
 much
 there
 and
 has


the
 administration's
 thinking
 about
 its


role
 in
 the
 city
 changed
 at
 all?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 even
 if
 we've
 seen
 a
 a


rhetorical
 shift
 here,
 we
 really
 don't


have
 all
 that
 much
 evidence
 that
 we're


seeing
 a
 substantial
 change
 on
 the


ground.
 This
 operation
 in
 Minneapolis


still
 appears
 active.
 We're
 hearing
 as


well
 that
 roughly
 a
 100
 arrests
 were


recorded
 in
 Minneapolis
 just
 today.
 So


at
 this
 point,
 we
 have
 not
 seen
 that


reality
 on
 the
 ground
 match
 the
 shift
 in


rhetoric
 from
 the
 president
 on
 this


topic.


>> Tyler,
 what
 would
 it
 look
 like
 for


things
 to
 actually
 change
 on
 the
 ground?


One
 obvious
 step,
 Michael,
 would
 be
 that


they
 pulled
 back
 the
 border
 patrol


agents
 and
 the
 other
 federal
 officials


who
 are
 patrolling
 all
 across


Minneapolis
 and
 other
 cities
 where


leaders
 have
 said
 they
 don't
 want
 those


forces.


>> They'd
 start
 to
 reduce
 the
 numbers.
 They


would
 literally
 recall
 these
 agents,


>> right?
 And
 another
 step
 could
 possibly


be
 that
 there's
 firings
 of
 President


Trump's
 aids.
 There
 are
 many
 critics
 of


the
 president
 and
 even
 some
 of
 his


allies
 privately
 saying
 someone
 like


Christine
 Gnome
 maybe
 isn't
 right
 for


running
 the
 Homeland
 Security


Department,
 but
 the
 president
 walked
 out


of
 the
 White
 House
 today
 with
 Steven


Miller
 and
 told
 reporters
 that
 Christine


was
 doing
 a
 great
 job
 and
 she
 certainly


was
 not
 resigning.


>> Right.
 I
 mean,
 I
 suppose
 the
 other
 sign


of
 an
 on
 the
 ground
 change
 that
 matched


the
 rhetoric,
 to
 use
 your
 word,
 Zolan,


would
 be
 that
 the
 administration
 took


steps
 to
 follow
 through
 with
 an


investigation
 into
 Alex
 Py's
 killing.


They
 could,
 for
 example,
 name
 the
 Border


Patrol
 agent
 who
 shot
 him.
 They
 could


open
 an
 investigation
 into
 that
 agent.


They
 could
 arrest
 that
 agent
 in
 theory,


>> right?
 As
 of
 right
 now,
 the


investigation
 into
 this
 shooting
 does


not
 involve
 looking
 into
 criminal


wrongdoing
 of
 the
 agents
 that
 were


involved
 in
 this
 shooting.
 Right.
 We've


seen
 that
 this
 administration
 not
 only


has
 blamed
 the
 victims
 of
 these


shootings,
 but
 has
 also
 refrained
 from


actually
 investigating
 real
 wrongdoing


when
 it
 comes
 to
 the
 federal
 agents


involved
 here.
 So,
 that
 would
 be
 an


active
 step.
 And
 you
 know,
 yes,
 ICE
 does


typically
 have
 a
 presence
 in
 all
 these


cities,
 but
 it's
 worth
 reminding
 folks


that
 we
 have
 something
 different
 with


this
 kind
 of
 operation,
 which
 is
 that


you
 have
 this
 alphabet
 soup
 of
 federal


agents
 that
 are
 in
 Minneapolis
 right


now.
 It's
 not
 a
 normal
 ICE
 deployment.


You
 also
 have
 Border
 Patrol,
 which
 was


involved
 in
 this
 shooting,
 as
 well
 as


other
 federal
 agents.
 So,
 that's
 another


step
 they
 could
 take
 in
 just
 sort
 of


turning
 this
 into
 a
 more
 typical
 ICE


deployment.
 rather
 than
 one
 where
 you


have
 this
 hodgepodge
 of
 federal
 agents


dawned
 in
 camouflage
 that
 are
 now


currently
 marching
 through
 the
 streets


of
 Minneapolis.


>> Right.
 And
 seemingly
 with
 a
 hair
 trigger


approach
 to
 something
 as
 simple
 as


somebody
 holding
 a
 phone
 out
 in
 front
 of


them
 in
 the
 case
 of
 Alex
 Prey.


>> That's
 right.
 you
 would
 not
 only
 be


saying
 as
 the
 president,
 we're
 going
 to


deescalate
 this
 situation,
 but
 actually


taking
 concrete
 steps
 to
 scale
 back
 this


operation,
 which
 could
 then
 lead
 to


deescalation
 as
 well.


>> Right.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 repeating
 what
 you


said
 to
 a
 degree,
 Zolan,
 but
 when
 you


step
 back
 and
 really
 examine
 what's


truly
 different
 here
 beyond
 the


rhetoric,
 it
 seems
 like
 the
 answer
 is


not
 much.
 Not
 much
 yet,
 right?
 And
 and


that's
 important
 because
 often
 with


President
 Trump
 when
 you're
 going


through
 these
 news
 cycles,
 when
 he's


facing
 political
 blowback,
 and
 this
 one


it's
 definitely
 relevant,
 he
 kind
 of
 all


has
 this
 two-handed
 approach,
 right?


>> He
 both
 has
 this
 reactionary
 defense
 for


federal
 agents,
 for
 the
 federal


crackdown,
 for
 his
 agenda.
 And
 then
 at


the
 very
 same
 time,
 he
 will
 try
 to


distance
 himself
 from
 that
 same
 agenda


when
 it
 gets
 political
 backlash,
 when
 it


causes
 trouble
 for
 him.


>> Right.
 Zolan,
 when
 you
 walked
 out
 of
 the


Oval
 Office
 with
 Tyler
 a
 week
 and
 a
 half


ago
 after
 your
 interview
 with
 Trump,
 you


described
 this
 as
 the
 president


conducting
 himself
 like
 a
 bystander
 to


his
 own
 presidency
 and
 its
 policies
 and


its
 actions.


>> Yes.
 And
 I
 think
 this
 is
 another
 example


of
 that,
 of
 the
 president
 trying
 to
 be
 a


bystander
 to
 his
 own
 policies.
 This
 is


the
 president
 that
 talked
 about
 mass


deportations,
 not
 only
 mass


deportations,
 but
 deploying
 federal


agents
 to
 American
 cities,


>> right?
 And
 this
 is
 what's
 come
 with


that.
 This
 is
 also
 the
 president
 that
 at


times
 has
 talked
 about
 how
 law


enforcement
 could
 deter
 crime
 by
 holding


quote
 one
 really
 violent
 day.
 That's


something
 he
 said
 during
 his
 own


campaign.
 Right.
 Right.


>> And
 we
 have
 seen
 many
 violent
 days.


That's
 right.
 But
 it
 seems
 at least
 in


this
 current
 moment,
 we're
 seeing


President
 Trump
 as
 a
 bystander
 to
 his


own
 policy
 and
 not
 President
 Trump


aggressively
 defending
 his
 policy
 no


matter
 the
 circumstances.
 Tyler,
 if


people
 sense
 that
 this


tone
 shift
 is
 just
 a
 tone
 shift,
 really


kind
 of
 a
 veneer,


it's
 clearly
 not
 going
 to
 satisfy
 the


fury
 of
 motans,
 of
 those
 Republicans
 in


Congress
 who
 are
 demanding
 change,
 who


are
 demanding
 hearings,
 including
 in
 the


Senate.
 And
 it's
 especially
 not
 going
 to


satisfy
 Democrats
 who
 are
 currently


threatening
 to
 block
 funding
 bills


required
 to
 keep
 the
 federal
 government


open
 through
 the
 end
 of
 this
 week.


>> Yeah,
 Michael,
 we
 have
 not
 seen
 the
 end


of
 this
 story.
 And
 just
 as
 we're
 talking


now,
 the
 president
 is
 taking
 questions


and
 when
 he's
 asked,
 "Do
 you
 plan
 to


pull
 agents
 out
 of
 Minnesota?"
 he
 says,


"We'll
 do
 what'sever
 appropriate."


That's
 a
 decision
 that
 the
 president


gets
 to
 make,


>> right?
 and
 he's
 not
 defining
 the


parameters
 by
 which
 he
 would
 change


course.
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 really


notable.
 And
 I
 think
 those
 are
 going
 to


be
 the
 questions
 that
 lawmakers
 are


asking
 of
 the
 administration
 as
 they


move
 forward
 with
 these
 critical


government
 funding
 bills.
 I
 mean,
 we


just
 saw
 choosing
 Collins,
 a
 Republican


of
 Maine,
 who
 told
 Christy
 Gnome
 that


she
 wants
 a
 pause
 of
 ICE
 enforcement
 in


Maine
 and
 Minnesota.
 Holan,
 very


quickly,
 is
 there
 a
 real
 risk
 that
 the


situation
 that
 the
 president
 and
 those


around
 him
 have
 created
 in
 a
 place
 like


Minneapolis
 with
 ICE,
 with
 Border


Patrol,
 could
 actually
 lead
 to
 some
 form


of
 a
 government
 shutdown
 in
 the
 next
 few


days.


>> It's
 always
 tough
 to
 make
 a
 prediction,


particularly
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 Congress.


But
 when
 you
 have
 not
 only
 Democrats
 but


also
 Republicans
 who
 are
 expressing


concern
 about
 the
 agency
 at
 the
 center


of
 this
 operation
 and
 as
 Tyler
 said,
 you


also
 have
 someone
 who's
 incredibly


influential
 in
 the
 appropriations


committee,
 Susan
 Collins,


>> also
 expressing
 that
 concern.
 That
 is


like
 a
 red
 alert
 moment
 for
 those
 in
 the


White
 House
 who
 are
 anxious
 about
 a


government
 shutdown,
 right?
 So,
 we
 have


to
 watch
 what's
 going
 to
 happen
 here,


but
 there
 are
 definitely
 signs
 that


members
 of
 Congress
 that
 would
 be
 needed


in
 order
 to
 prevent
 a
 government


shutdown
 that
 they
 are
 watching
 what's


going
 on
 in
 Minneapolis
 um
 as
 well
 as


other
 cities
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 this


operation.


you
 just
 to
 end
 this
 conversation,
 it


strikes
 me
 and
 Zolan,
 you
 talked
 about


this
 in
 the
 in
 the
 very
 beginning
 of


this
 conversation
 that
 the
 president
 has


just
 objectively
 speaking


over
 the
 past
 year
 quickly
 achieved
 many


of
 his
 immigration
 goals.
 He
 sealed
 the


border.
 He
 reduced
 crossings
 to
 a


historic
 low,
 a
 trickle.


And
 then
 with
 these
 deployments
 of
 ICE


and
 Border
 Patrol
 in
 cities
 like


Minneapolis,


it
 no
 longer
 feels
 like
 much
 of
 a
 debate


here.
 He
 turned
 what
 many


see
 as
 a
 kind
 of
 achievement
 into
 this


exceptionally
 dark
 chapter
 of
 his


presidency.
 And
 it
 just
 didn't
 need
 to


be
 that
 way.


>> Yes.
 And
 you
 know
 this
 policy
 more
 than


any
 other
 policy,
 the
 president
 has
 just


been
 incredibly
 emboldened.
 He's
 been


surrounded
 by
 people
 that
 will
 turn
 his


impulses
 into
 actually
 policy
 that
 will


impact
 people
 on
 the
 ground.
 He
 has
 felt


that
 he
 has
 had
 the
 political
 support
 of


his
 own
 party
 and
 for
 the
 most
 part
 the


country
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 this


immigration
 agenda
 from
 the
 campaign


until
 now.
 And
 yeah,
 he's
 he's
 faced


push
 back
 at
 times,
 but
 he
 has
 never


really
 even
 rhetorically
 acknowledged


the
 need
 to
 scale
 back.
 And
 now
 it
 seems


we
 are
 at
 the
 point
 where
 the
 president


has
 realized
 that
 he
 might
 have
 overshot


on
 this
 agenda
 item
 where
 actually
 he


went
 so
 far
 on
 this
 agenda


that
 now
 the
 optics
 are
 actually
 not


working
 in
 his
 favor.


>> Right.
 And
 it
 is
 still
 early
 in
 this


cycle
 and
 we
 don't
 know
 what's
 going
 to


happen
 next.
 But
 we
 actually
 do
 have
 one


takeaway
 that
 we
 can
 say
 already
 from


this
 and
 that's
 that
 President
 Trump


wasn't
 moved
 to
 scale
 back
 this


operation
 upon
 learning
 that
 Renee
 Good


was
 shot
 and
 killed
 or
 upon
 learning


that
 Mr.
 Prey
 was
 shot
 and
 killed.
 In


fact,
 he
 initially
 laid
 the
 blame
 on


both
 of
 them.
 He
 was
 moved
 on
 this
 when


he
 heard
 that
 it
 was
 hurting
 him


politically.


[music]


That's
 the
 guard
 rail
 it
 seems
 at
 this


moment
 for
 his
 immigration
 policy.


[music]
 And
 I
 think
 that's
 notable
 and


it's
 something
 we
 should
 watch
 as
 we
 try


to
 report
 out
 just
 how
 much
 further
 this


is
 going
 to
 expand
 or
 if
 this
 is
 really


going
 to
 be
 scaled
 back
 in
 a
 definitive


way.


>> [music]


[music]


>> Well,
 Zolan
 and
 Tyler,
 thank
 you
 very


much.
 We
 appreciate
 it.


>> Thanks
 so
 much,
 Michael.


>> Thank
 you,
 Michael.


On
 [music]
 Tuesday
 night,
 White
 House


Deputy
 Chief
 of
 Staff
 Steven
 Miller


appeared
 to
 back
 away
 from
 his
 original


inaccurate
 claims
 [music]


about
 Alex
 PR's
 death.
 In
 a
 statement
 to


CNN,
 Miller
 [music]
 said
 that
 the
 White


House
 was
 now
 evaluating
 why
 the
 Border


Patrol
 agents
 responsible
 for
 PR's
 death


may
 have
 failed
 [music]
 to
 follow


government
 protocols.


>> [music]


>> We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[music]
 Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need


another
 day.
 On
 Tuesday
 night,
 a
 man


tried
 to
 attack
 [music]
 Democratic


Congresswoman
 Ilhan
 Omar
 of
 Minnesota,
 a


frequent
 target
 [music]
 of
 personal


insults
 from
 President
 Trump.


must
 resign
 or
 face
 impeachment.


>> The
 attack,
 which
 involved
 a
 syringe,


>> oh
 my
 god,
 he
 sprayed
 something
 on
 her.


>> Came
 during
 a
 town
 hall
 meeting
 moments


[music]
 after
 Omar
 called
 for
 abolishing


ICE
 and
 impeaching
 [music]


Christine
 Gnome.
 The
 attacker
 was


quickly
 tackled
 and
 arrested,
 and
 Omar


was
 [music]
 unheard.


And
 new
 census
 data
 shows
 that
 over
 the


last
 year,
 America's
 population
 grew
 at


one
 of
 the
 slowest
 [music]
 rates
 in
 the


country's
 history.
 A
 major
 reason
 for


the
 slowdown
 was
 the
 decline
 in


immigration,
 [music]


which
 plunged
 by
 more
 than
 50%
 because


of
 President
 Trump's
 secondterm


policies,
 combined
 with
 a
 long-term


decline
 in
 the
 [music]
 American
 birth


rate.
 Overall,
 the
 country's
 population


grew
 by
 about
 1.8
 [music]


million
 people,
 a
 growth
 rate
 of
 about


half
 a
 percentage
 [music]
 point.
