Do you have an opinion on whether Cardi
B performed at the Super Bowl?
I mean, it's funny, but it's also kind
of relevant because I saw someone has
actually filed a complaint to the
commission about Kalshi's decision
specifically.
Well, of course, we're spending a lot of
resources investigating whether Cardi B
performed was
really our focus here is is on the
market.
So the unique thing that the great thing
about the way that we regulate the
markets is that the exchanges themselves
similar to on the security side are
self-regulatory organizations.
So each exchange has its own rulebook
that's been approved by the agency.
It has its own requirements for
contracts that are certified on the
exchange.
So of course, the Cardi B contracts went
through a self-certification process and
then they're they're settled in
accordance with exchange rules.
They go through a clearinghouse as well.
So the exchanges each have these
rulebooks and certain requirements
around how the contracts are resolved
and settled.
And of course, now we're seeing some
differences amongst courses, rulebook
and poly markets rulebook.
But that's the great thing about our
markets and having the ability to build
a business, to develop an exchange with
some flexible guardrails on top that the
agency oversees.
But we don't prescribe exactly what has
to be in the rulebook.
We have a principles based system of
regulation.
Hello and welcome to another episode of
the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy
Alloway.
Tracy, did you watch the Superbowl?
You know, I was going to ask that and I
knew it actually, I was going to start
exactly the same way I did watch the
Super Bowl.
And so I feel empowered to ask you a
very controversial.
Oh yeah, not which halftime show you
watched, but
did Cardi B perform at the Super Bowl?
Oh.
Right, because this was a big thing.
I forgot that there was.
You know what?
I'm aware of various sort of questions
about prediction markets and things that
people place bets on.
Well, how did that resolve?
What was what was the basic issue here
again?
So I think it's still being resolved in
various ways.
But, you know, Cardi B, she was on set
during Bad Bunny's, you know,
extravaganza and she was kind of like
dancing and singing along, like mouthing
words, at least along with other people
like Pedro Pascal and Jessica Alba.
Yeah, Lady Gaga.
Lady Gaga.
It was like singing together.
Right, right, right.
The only reason this matters at all is
because of prediction markets.
So there was a bet.
Will Cardi B perform?
And now the question is, does standing
on stage and kind of bobbing your head
and mouthing words count as a
performance?
Poly market says it does, Carol.
She says it doesn't.
Oh, interesting.
Yeah.
There you go.
She and probably market split over
whether Cardi B performed.
That's great.
That's a great tension.
I like that.
It is.
It was striking to me, setting aside
that I actually somehow seem to have
missed the specific thing, like how much
prediction markets are now are just part
of the consumption experience.
You know, even you look at all these
different things that people are talking
about, there was is Lady Gaga going to
show up somehow like someone made a bet
on it before it went public.
But also, just like with each score, you
know, you check the line is like, how
much did this move the expectations of
whether the Seahawks are leading like
prediction markets are truly becoming
part of like pop culture and how we
interact with pop culture.
There were some weird bets around like
color of Gatorade that was going to get
dumped on the coach.
Yeah,
length of like the national anthem being
sung.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Did you see that?
Like, I was tempted by some of those,
but I stayed away.
I'm still I haven't used Pie market or
Kalshi probably lies.
You know, the interesting thing too is
like how much the mood has swung right
because a few years ago, like, I don't
know, 20, 22, 2023, I think we did an
episode like and that time, like there
was almost nothing and the sort of like
regulatory 180, the degree to the
liberalization of these markets has been
pretty remarkable.
Even, you know, going back to a year and
a half ago, there was just polymarket
and it was just the offshore version
that you had to fund with Stablecoins.
Yeah.
And now it's like exploded at the time,
you know, Kalshi was very limited.
They didn't have U.S.
access, etc., or very curtailed U.S.
access.
Anyway, they're here and everyone's
trying to wrap their heads around where
this is all going and stuff.
Yeah, it feels like they're much more
sanctioned, I guess, than they used.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But that said, there are still some
issues that people are trying to work
out.
You have ambiguous outcomes like did
Cardi B actually perform?
You have concerns around insider
trading, although not insider trading
per se, because we're not talking about
securities contracts, but maybe people
with insider info who inadvertently
disclose something material.
I was thinking about this actually, so
you can also bet on which companies are
going to run Super Bowl ads.
Oh yeah.
And a lot of people must know if a
company is going to run an ad like that.
You have like the agency actors, like
everyone, and you could argue maybe that
that's material, non-public information,
right?
You run a Super Bowl ad, you get a bunch
of attention, maybe your share price
goes up if you're publicly listed.
Yeah, I don't know.
There are so many things anyway, rather
than just keep talking about them
because we can talk for an hour.
We really do have the perfect guest.
We're going to be speaking with Mike
Selig.
He is the new chairman of the CFTC, the
main regulator for prediction markets.
He's just sworn in in December.
We're going to talk all about this,
maybe some crypto as well.
So, Mike, thank you so much for coming
on Odd Lots, coming into the studio.
Glad to be here.
What do you tell us a little bit about
just broadly coming into this new role?
Like what are your goals here with the
CFTC or really at a pivotal moment?
You mentioned prediction markets, crypto
AI, all manner of new technologies and
products that are impacting our markets.
And the CFTC was really this kind of a
little known regulator before the
financial crisis regulated in the
futures markets.
It's it has expanded jurisdiction over
the swaps markets, the over counter
derivatives markets.
And now we see so much innovation in
that space with things like prediction
markets and crypto, with legislation on
the verge of hopefully being on the
president's desk.
And so the agency is really at this
unique moment where it has the
opportunity to shape the future of these
new and emerging markets.
And it's really exciting time to be in
the seat.
Do you have an opinion on whether Cardi
B performed at the Super Bowl?
I mean, it's funny, but it's also kind
of relevant because I saw someone has
actually filed a complaint to the
commission about Kalshi's decision
specifically.
Well, of course, we're spending a lot of
resources investigating whether Cardi B
performed.
Really our focus here is on the market.
So the unique thing that the great thing
about the way that we regulate the
markets is that the exchanges themselves
similar to on the security side, are
self-regulatory organizations.
So each exchange has its own rulebook
that's been approved by the agency.
It has its own requirements for
contracts that are certified on the
exchange.
So of course the Cardi B contracts went
through a self-certification process and
then they're they're settled in
accordance with exchange rules.
They go through a clearinghouse as well.
So the exchanges each have these
rulebooks and certain requirements
around how the contracts are resolved
and settled.
And of course, now we're seeing some
differences amongst courses, rulebook
and poly markets for rulebook.
But that's the great thing about our
markets and having the ability to build
a business, to develop an exchange with
some flexible guardrails on top that the
agency oversees.
But we don't prescribe exactly what has
to be in the rulebook.
We have a principles based system of
regulation.
What is the basis for something like Is
Cardi B going to perform at the Super
Bowl halftime show?
What is the basis for this being
categorized as a true financial
instrument regulated by the CFTC?
Because it certainly just feels like
problematic to me.
Who has economic exposure?
They need to hedge to Cardi B
performing.
There's a really interesting historical
story around the definition of commodity
and the markets that we regulate today.
Starting back in the thirties, when the
Commodity Exchange Act was first
ratified, it was originally focused on
grain and over time we've had things
like workbench come a long way.
Exactly.
It's come a very long way.
Of course, with the financial crisis, we
got all manner of of new products within
our authority.
But but the definition of commodities,
extraordinarily broad.
It includes virtually everything except
a few things have been carved out,
onions and motion picture box office
receipts.
And that's a really important point to
note that they were expressly carved
out.
So most things in our commerce today,
even securities are technically
considered commodities under our act,
and we have authority to regulate them.
In the case of securities, we coordinate
with the SEC and have some joint
authority.
But for all other types of products,
services, REITs, indices, people are
going to hedge that risk.
They're going to be in the market to
speculate on those products.
And so we don't merit regulate.
We don't tell people what they should be
entering into contracts on.
We create rules and regulations around
those markets to make sure that they
have integrity, that they're resilient,
that they're vibrant and they have
guardrails and investor protections.
And so that's why going back to the
exchange rulebooks and other controls,
self-certification being an important
process or making sure those markets are
safe and secure.
But we're not telling people whether to
trade pork bellies or Cardi B contracts
or anything else.
So let's go to the insider trading
question, because this is sort of top of
mind for a lot of people.
Technically, it's not insider trading,
but, you know, it does look like some
people have inside knowledge sometimes
when they put on big bets on something
that just happens to happen the next
day.
The CFTC hasn't, as far as I know, given
a lot of guidance on this issue, how are
you actually thinking about it?
Well, from a legal standpoint, I think
there's a bit of a misunderstanding
about the insider trading doctrine at
the CFTC.
So the authority at the agency is very
similar to the authority at the SEC
under our anti-fraud anti M.P.
lation rule.
We do have authority to police insider
trading in the commodities markets.
Now the way that insider trading is
carried out is oftentimes different from
a situation where you have information
asymmetries relevant to a company.
But there are situations where you have
informational asymmetries related to the
markets placing a trade ahead of a
customer, for example, or even in this
situation now with prediction markets.
And that's something we are thinking
about and certainly on the beat and
exploring.
So we surveil the markets, we collect
data, we have information about, for
example, you know, our players
participating in these markets are
people associated with the sports
leagues, etc.
And so we are a cop on the beat in that
regard.
So the doctrines not entirely different,
but there are some nuances that we are
aware of and making sure that we're
policing for.
Would Polly Market or Kalshi, in your
view, be allowed to live stream a video
of a giant roulette wheel and create
futures trade?
Let people trade futures on when it
lands on right or black.
Some of these types of gaming where it's
really a game of chance and not a game
of skill.
There's definitely a difference.
And I think when we look at what's a
commodity, it's possible that you could
construct some sort of contract, an
esoteric derivative, but really the
underlying and a game of skill is very
different.
There's a clear economic risk
associated, for example, at the Super
Bowl.
It's a good example.
There's a ton of economic activity
associated with that.
There's hotel revenue that comes from
it.
There's vendors, there's activity within
the city, tourism, all of that.
And so there's a real reason to hedge
that risk with a game of chance.
It's harder to say it's possible you can
attract something by it, but it's less
likely that that's a real underlying.
Well, what is like the difference?
Because, you know, let's say it's what
is bad.
Bunny's first song going to be at the
Super Bowl.
Like, what is the difference between
that?
Which doesn't really seem any more
economic than, you know, a roulette
wheel and whatever it is?
Well, to be clear, there's no
requirement in the act that there has to
necessarily be some merit based result
from it, from a contract.
I do think with a lot of these
information markets, these prediction
markets where they're forecasting a
potential outcome in the future, they
produce a lot of useful information.
We are seeing newsrooms incorporate
prediction markets.
We're seeing sports live broadcasts,
incorporate prediction markets.
We're seeing the information use in
particular.
A great example is the election in 2024
where the president had a very large
victory and that was not necessarily
forecast in many of the polls.
But of course, the prediction markets
got that right.
So so it's something that I think is
valuable to society.
The question of having regulation
around, that's a separate question.
I think that's an important one.
We are certainly taking on that task and
making sure that we don't let these
markets languish or I we don't push them
offshore, but we develop the right rules
and regulations to develop investor
protections and make sure that the
markets are flourishing here in the
United States.
Since we're discussing prediction
markets through the prism through the
medium of the Super Bowl.
And you mentioned players as well
looking at player behavior.
If a player were to place a bet on, I
don't know, a specific play during the
game and then they did it themselves
like something that they actually have
agency over.
Would that be something that you would
investigate or look into?
You know, I think it's all facts and
circumstances.
So we'd evaluate potentially to the
extent that there's insiders that are
involved in the markets, we get that
data.
We're actually talking to a lot of the
sports leagues.
We're talking to participants in the
markets to make sure that we are on top
of things, have, you know, information
about who is able to be participate in
these markets, who's not.
We do have at the exchange level, the
exchanges are really the first line of
defense, and they are surveilling the
markets.
They're doing KYC on their customers.
And so that's certainly something we're
on top of and we'd consider and evaluate
on a case by case basis.
Why isn't trading sports derivatives
gambling or betting, or is it better?
Well, there really is an interesting
history here.
So if you go back to the Thirties
National, you know, grain betting was a
thing right then that was considered a
national pastime.
And so for as long as we've had
derivatives markets, we've had these
so-called bucket drops which were, you
know, these these off exchange markets
where people were just placing bets
against the house on the future price of
a commodity.
On the other hand, you had organized
exchanges.
So the Chicago Board of Trade, later CME
and others had organized markets with
market integrity.
They had derivative instruments,
contracts where you actually were in a
contract with another person.
And then now in our markets, we have a
clearinghouse innovating and standing in
the middle of those contracts.
But you have a buyer for every seller
with the with the kind of bookie model
that's not the case or betting against
the house.
And there's a lot of different rules
when you're betting in the house, you
don't have the liquidity of being able
to offset your position or sell a lot of
your position.
You're kind of stuck taking whatever the
bookies giving you, and some of the odds
are very different.
So you're actually based on the odds of
the bookie as opposed to here where the
contracts go up and down in value based
on actual market activity.
And so over time, the Supreme Court
actually blocked some of this bucket
shop activity by saying you can't take
the price quotations from the organized
exchanges and use them in a bucket shop.
But a lot of these bucket drops over the
years have now moved into gaming and
other things.
We're seeing really the same phenomenon
where we have casinos and other
operations that are operating lawfully
under state requirements and
regulations, but they don't have the
same sorts of controls.
You know, we regulate a nearly 500
trillion notional market with the swaps
market.
We have very stringent requirements and
controls around our exchanges, and these
contracts reflect that.
They go through a very stringent process
of self-certification.
They can't be readily susceptible to
methylation.
We surveil those markets, we police
things like insider trading.
And so it's a much more robust scheme on
top of these markets, much higher
stringent requirements.
And so I do think.
We're seeing a lot of parallels between
the thirties and forties and today.
But rest assured that we're on top of
these markets and these have the same
sorts of investor protections that you
would expect in the securities markets
and in our futures markets.
Hmm.
Out of curiosity, how much of your time
is split now between the new stuff,
prediction markets, crypto versus the I
guess the old boring older exchanges?
Yeah, all very well.
Our day to day is really the traditional
markets.
And when we talk about these new
markets, many of the incumbents are
getting into the space as well.
We're seeing more and more of these
products offered on our traditional DC
ATMs.
But all of these are the same
registration category, right?
There are some nuances in how they're
set up.
There's some new action relief that's
been given to some of these platforms
historically.
But this is not it's not, you know, our
day to day bulk of work.
That said, given that it's new and given
that there's so much that is changing,
we have a lot of more a lot more
rulemaking and policy work to do in this
space.
So so I do think it's a big piece
because of that.
But in terms of the actual size of these
markets compared to are, as I said, that
$500 trillion notional swaps market, $40
trillion notional futures markets, it's
a smaller piece, but but it's growing.
And I think blockchain is going to
really change in particular how some of
these existing exchanges operate, how
they settle transactions and so forth.
And so it's a really exciting time to be
in the seat.
So I get that there are some market
structure differences between a futures
exchange on sports versus the
traditional horse sense, the odds and so
forth.
But from the perspective of the user or
the person who's putting money on the
line, like I think most people would say
like economically they're very similar
and they're getting more similar because
we know that say like the Kalshi and Poly
market they're trying to get into,
figure out how to do parlays and stuff.
So like it's getting closer and closer
and you know, people have a lot of
concerns about sports gambling and the
effect that that has on young people and
so forth legalizing, you know, national
legalization of these.
It de facto lowers the age in a lot of
states because in a lot of states, the
legal age to gamble is 21, And the legal
age to treat a futures like 18, I
believe is this is this is do you think
that's good that we've de facto lowered
the age to bet on sports or again we're
not married regulators.
We don't pass judgment on kind of the
age requirements in our securities
markets and our derivatives markets.
We have certain standards that have been
upheld in these markets.
People are betting on, you know, any any
number of assets.
Right, if you want.
But that's overwhelmingly sports.
I mean, I think that said, you have the
ability to make investments and trade
options and all manner of security is
all manner of commodities.
And so the rules are not different based
on doing sports or this or that.
You know, I think this term betting has
been used and thrown about in in our
securities markets and our derivatives
markets as well.
So I don't think it necessarily means
anything in particular.
But the notion is that you're able to
make decisions at 18 in our markets and
we uphold that state by state.
Some of the standards are set even
higher.
And that is not something that, you
know, I have a particular opinion on.
I think that's just the way when you say
what do you mean in state by, say, some
of the standards or some some of the
states have flexibility in what they set
up for drinking or for, you know,
gambling.
And they're like, this is financial
market activity.
These are not wagers.
You're not betting against the house.
We have significant overlay from a
regulatory standpoint over these
markets.
And so we're not gatekeeping particular
categories of market selections or
sports and having different standards.
That's not how we've typically done
things.
And so we don't intend to do that in
this particular market.
So you're not a merit based regulator,
but you are a technical regulator.
And as we've been discussing, there's a
lot going on, lots of rulemaking to do,
lots of potential enforcement actions.
There's a Barron's story out today
talking about how the CFTC apparently
has no enforcement officers left in its
Chicago office.
And you used to have 20, but everyone
resigned, it seems.
How are you balancing all these new
markets, which are growing really,
really fast and pose some very thorny
questions that we've been discussing
with more limited resources?
Well, look, a lot of the folks that left
that was before my tenure and certainly,
you know, I'm not blaming you.
It's not you know, they didn't leave
right after I joined it.
But but no, I think I think it's a
serious question.
Right.
We've got to make sure that we have
adequate staff to police the markets.
And we do have a ton of staff throughout
the country.
And, you know, to the point of our
Chicago office, of course, it's
important that we have folks within that
office.
But we don't have a Texas office.
We don't have a Florida office.
We don't have offices in every state.
We have a handful of offices.
We've got a critical mass in D.C.
and a number of folks in New York as
well.
And those are.
Two largest offices.
We continue to fill those out and we
would love to have more people in
Chicago.
And, you know, the door is always open
for folks that want to come in and work
for us.
And we continue to build out the ranks
there.
But we have adequate resources.
We have a ton of folks within each of
our offices, and we're actually
leveraging a lot of the new technologies
like A.I.
to make sure that we're surveilling the
markets and that we're reviewing things
like insider trading and bringing cases
where it makes sense.
We're also processing applications very
quickly.
We just processed, I think, in a record
time of 200 days, one of the more recent
exchange applications.
So we're really well-staffed, but we're
continuing to build that out and make
sure that we have good people in the
building who are competent and able to
make sure that we protect our markets.
So you have the funding to you have the
funding to add headcount.
And are you pursuing like building out
the headcount?
Do you need more funding?
Absolutely.
So.
So we are actually staffing up.
Okay.
So 100%, we're building that out.
We have adequate resources to do so.
But I want to be clear that we have a
very well staffed building and we are
very much on top of things with and, you
know, these questions around not
enforcing and surveilling.
You know, I think there's a little bit
of fake news there.
We probably should put it up to a
prediction market.
But but I do think that we're on top of
things.
So one thing I know about the Trump
administration, they are big fan
seemingly of cutting costs, cutting
spending, streamlining the federal
government in some ways and, you know,
sometimes cutting agencies altogether.
This has been a really long running
question in market structure world.
But why don't we just combine the CFTC?
Oh, yeah, that's easy.
It's everybody's favorite question.
Yeah, look, the CFTC and FCC are very
different regulators.
So the SEC is a capital markets
regulator.
They are focused on somebody wants to go
raise capital for a great idea.
Other people want to place that capital
somewhere.
There needs to be some regulation over
that.
After the Great Depression, there was a
lot of chaos in the markets and the
agency really was a great answer to that
issue.
And as as put a great regime in place to
regulate all of that.
The CFTC grew up actually at a different
time.
The original act was in the thirties,
but later on the CFTC was established in
the seventies.
But the purpose of the CFTC is to
regulate risk mitigation, risk
management, very different areas.
So there are firms that whether farmers,
ranchers, energy producers, now we have
data centers in the air space, but but
all manner of businesses have a bunch of
risk related to the inputs for their
business and ongoing operations, and
they need to hedge that risk.
And there are other participants that
want to supply liquidity into those
markets, make markets or speculate, and
the CFTC regulates that.
So very different purpose for the
regulator.
There's not the same sort of disclosure
regime that we have at the FCC.
And so it makes sense to have two
separate regulators.
But what doesn't make sense and what
Chairman Adkins and I have been very
clear on is the lack of coordination
between the agencies.
So it's coordination, not consolidation.
We need to harmonize the two regimes to
make sure that there's not inconsistent
and incompatible rules and that there's
not gaps.
So Chairman Atkins has referred to this
no man's land between the two agencies
where you've got the bodies of all these
dead products and services that
otherwise could have been, if the
agencies could just figure out how to
coordinate security features is a great
example.
We have shared jurisdiction there, but
we've really failed to work well
together to get that off the ground.
And so I think it's really a new day at
both agencies where we're intending to
work closely together on that.
Yeah, this is exactly what I wanted to
ask.
So I've heard people talk about
increased cooperation and coordination
between the S.E.C.
and the CFTC, basically ever since the
financial crisis.
And it hasn't really happened or it
hasn't happened to the degree that some
people would like to see.
What's your diagnosis of the actual
problem there?
And I would love to get into the weeds
here and, you know, like, what does
coordination look like between the two
agencies?
Yeah, I'm in a good position in that I
used to work for Chairman Adkins, But,
you know, so I think we have a great
relationship just getting off for the
start.
But a memorandum of understanding is
something that we've committed to
execute and we're looking to execute
very soon.
And that really set all the ground rules
for coordination between the staffs.
And so not having that in place I think
is really hampered the two agencies
because sharing information is really
important.
You need a framework for sharing that
information.
There's a lot of nonpublic material that
that is generated in each building.
And so having rules for the sharing of
that information is important.
Having regular meetings between the
staffs and coordination and sharing of
market data related to registrants is
really important.
So if we've got dual registrars and
we're collecting our own sets of
information and we're ensuring that
they're each complying with these two
kind of separate fortresses of rules and
regulations, how do we know what, what,
who's doing what and what needs to be
changed?
And.
So having the information is really
important.
That's the first step.
And then the staffs need to come
together and figure out how to create
substitute compliance.
So certain rules are incompatible on
both sides.
We need to knock those out or at least
have a kind of default choice.
One agency versus the other.
If you're a broker dealer and you're
doing a very minimal amount of commodity
derivatives activity, perhaps you should
have a primary regulator at the FCC with
some CFTC overlay to make sure that
there's no gaps.
So that's an important piece.
I think a lot of the general like crypto
related issues are really calling for
joint rulemaking, joint work between the
agencies because we're seeing NVIDIA
tokens on chain, not necessarily within
the U.S., but I think now with the DTC,
we're going to start seeing a lot more
of the tokenization of public equities.
And then we're also seeing Bitcoin
ether, things that are with the within
our territory trading on screen and
those worlds are going to collide and
then they are in fact colliding today.
And so having common ground between the
agencies, figuring out what the ground
rules are and making sure that we have
similar standards for decentralized
finance and for digital wallets.
And all of that is really important
because if we set incompatible
standards, then it's going to be a real
disservice to the market and that's
going to harm all Americans.
Kalshi had an ad recently.
It said, P.O.V.
is a girl and it's a pure V.
I was about I was about to be unable to
pay my rent, but I got two years of rent
through Kalshi's predictions.
It's amazing.
This is seems more aggressive even than,
you know, the traditional sports
betting.
And there's all kinds of sports betting
ads.
And then they have a thing where if
you're a problem gambler, call this
number.
Should there be any limiting factor on
how aggressively sports these prediction
markets should be advertised or that?
That's one point that I think is is
worth double clicking on in the sense
that there are standards for a futures
Commission emergence for brokers within
our markets.
And some of those standards are a relic
essentially of the way that the act and
the regulation is developed where you
have a intermediation between the
customer and the clearinghouse and the
exchange.
Typically in our markets.
Now these no action ladders that started
around 2000 that were given to some of
the prediction markets back then as well
as now.
Other markets cut out the the FCA and
cut out the broker.
And so you had direct to the
clearinghouse, direct to the exchange.
And that model doesn't have all the same
rules and regulations.
And so something that we're thinking
about is how do we make sure that we
have consistent standards across both.
Now I think this question of what sort
of marketing and advertising either
should be able to engage in is one that
that we're certainly going to think
about.
So just to be clear, there are current
rules on, say, a futures broker and how
they can market.
But when these new no action letters
were established that allowed the sort
of the futures entity itself to offer
directly, they didn't have the rules.
What are the rules?
And would an ad like these like like if
if if a futures broker like, I don't
know, forget MF Global or something that
like, oh, I couldn't pay my rent.
But then now I'm, you know, now my now
I'll never have to work again because I
traded wheat futures.
That seems a little weird and I've never
seen an ad like that, right.
I mean it really is this result of the
way that these no action letters were
handed down, as I said many, many years
ago.
And this kind of regime that we have,
that really my view on a lot of this
stuff is that we need clear rules of the
road.
We need to do things through notice and
comment rulemaking and actually think
holistically about our markets and not
focus on these little patchwork, no
action letters, which unfortunately has
been the rule over many years.
And so that's definitely something we're
thinking about.
We want to set clear standards.
We want stakeholders at the table to
figure out what these regimes should
look like.
And I'm not one necessarily to say what
the marketing should look like.
We want to hear from participants as to
what what sort of marketing they think
is appropriate for these markets.
But what we're certainly thinking about
that and there are different standards.
It really is just a result of that kind
of ad hoc way that regulators in the
past have gone about establishing
exceptions for certain things in the
markets.
Well, on this note, do you maybe need
new classifications?
Because it seems like all these
different worlds are kind of melding
together where you might have a crypto
trading platform that's now offering
derivatives and other things, and then
you have like an old school exchange
that is offering essentially bets on
your number, go up, number go down.
At the moment, I think your registration
categories are pretty like standardized
and you have three of them, is that
right?
Like futures exchange, swap, execution,
stuff like that.
Now, we've got too many.
We've got many.
Okay.
On anymore.
All right.
More than that.
So could you create even more to sort of
encompass the industry changes that
we're seeing?
Well, we certainly need to think
holistically about what requirements we
have on different participants.
So these non-answer mediated exchanges
and we're also seeing a lot of vertical
integration with a single business
owning a clearinghouse.
And and the broker and the exchange are
seeing different models where where
there's that non intermediated as I
said, we don't have enough CRM at all
and then you have everything in between.
And so we need to think about that.
We need to make sure there's consistent
standards.
We don't want a regulatory arbitrage
where because you don't have the broker,
you're able to do more.
Now the way that these have been set up
under no action letters today, they do
not allow for any margin.
So they're they're not they're fully
collateralized.
And so if you go directly to the
clearinghouse as a customer, you're
putting up for collateral.
And so that's something as well, or
we're seeing more institutional interest
in these markets.
They would prefer to be able to put up
margin and go through a broker or have a
model where you don't have the broker at
all, but you're able to use margin.
So we're thinking about all these
things.
It's a really interesting time, as I
said, to be thinking about market
structure for things that really just
probably should have been done many
years ago.
And for whatever reason, people relied
on these no action letters.
And really, I guess it was more of a an
ankle biter at the time and didn't get a
full regime.
But we're thinking about all of that.
Donald Trump Jr is an adviser to Kalshi.
He's on the board of poly market and it
looks like truth social, which is
largely owned by president Trump, is
also going to launch something called
truth Predict.
How should the public feel comfortable
that these are well regulated markets
given the very obvious sort of like
stake that the that that the White House
has found or that the president and his
family has in this industry.
These are designated contract markets
like any other.
We have regulated these markets for for
many, many years, for decades.
They have some of the most stringent
regulatory requirements.
As I mentioned, these are nearly $500
trillion notional markets that we
regulate.
We take it very seriously.
We put these fraud and manipulation in
these markets.
So I think everybody can rest assured
that we are on top of of protecting the
markets.
And we think it's great that there's a
broad swath of interest in the markets.
But like so, for example, when you're
figuring out like what is the
appropriate level of advertising going
back to those Kalshi ads and you're
thinking like, okay, like how do you
know?
And you're talking about
talking to market participants, like who
is that?
And like, how should people feel
comfortable that you're going to find
that right line again when the
administration has a very clear economic
stake in this industry and having the
industry grow, we adhere to the law.
I mean, the Commodity Exchange Act is
our authorizing statute.
We act in accordance with the Commodity
Exchange Act and meet very strict ethics
and, you know, government requirements,
and as does, I think, everyone in this
administration.
So we take all of that very seriously.
So speaking of Trump, we should talk a
little bit more about crypto because
it's been having a pretty bad month so
far.
And I think one of the big hopes of the
industry, the Clarity Act, seems to be
stalled in Congress.
What happens if that doesn't go through?
Because you've sort of I feel like
you've committed yourself to being, you
know, a crypto digital asset friendly
administration or regulator in many
ways.
Well, thanks to the President's
leadership, I really do think we're at a
critical moment where we've got genius
now as law regulation, my enforcements
done.
We've got the Clarity Act that's really
on the precipice.
I think there's a few issues that are
being ironed out actually, as we speak.
I know there's a meeting today and we're
hopeful that that's going to get done.
I think that's going to set a really
futureproof framework for crypto here in
the U.S.
We can't allow European countries and
others to lead in this area without U.S.
involvement and leadership.
And so we're committed to getting that
done.
And I think we've got a really great
bill that's that's almost at the finish
line if it doesn't get done.
Look, I think there's a lot of authority
that the agencies have, but it's
important with Loper braids and some of
the case law that takes a little bit of
the agency's discretion over nuances in
the statute and puts that back to the
Congress and the courts, I think it's
really important to have more baked into
the statute than not.
And so we're hopeful that we'll get a
statute in place.
You know, one of the areas that crypto
seems to have been at the forefront of
is perpetual futures.
And, you know, it's very popular.
You see, like you can get 101 leverage
trading if futures on some platforms.
Do you see
the more use of perpetual perps in sort
of traditional finance, Could we have
perpetual oil futures at some point?
Like could you envision that?
Well, right now we're thinking about it
in crypto, I think, there.
I would like, you know, trade it on on
chain, like all futures, like you're
going for like, okay, crypto provides
the infrastructure, but could you like,
why not trade?
You know, again,
an oil perp on Unchained.
Look, if there's demand for these
products, it's definitely something that
we're all consider and look at right
now.
The overwhelming demand has been in the
crypto space.
We've seen some demand in precious
metals, gold, silver.
We have to consider their susceptibility
of each contract to manipulation.
So there might be unique considerations
around a contract that doesn't have a
physical delivery date with, for
example, pork bellies or other things,
and that can create issues within the
supply and liquidity for the futures
contracts.
So it's something we're thinking about.
We're definitely excited about all this
innovation.
It's been too long.
This stuff is only developed offshore
and we really want to bring it back with
clear rules of the road.
So it's really important that the U.S.
leads and that we set the standard that
other countries are going to follow
rather than just allow this stuff to
flourish offshore with potentially less
regulation.
As you all know, when you offer into
various countries, there's different
rules around offering directly in or
solicitation or solicitation, all of
that.
So we're certainly aware of that.
We're thinking about it.
We want to set really clear and kind of
best in class standards for U.S.
markets.
And just going back to prediction
markets, I know you keep emphasizing
that you're not a merit based regulator,
right?
So you're not making decisions on what
people should be betting on or what they
can bet on.
But is there like is there a line at
some point that you wouldn't want to see
private companies actually cross?
Like if someone creates a contract for
like someone's going to die, right, a
violent death or something, that that
would seem problematic or a contract.
And this came up when we talked to Dan
Wilson do Chicago, the contract for
whether people would throw sex toys onto
the court during a WNBA game, which of
course the existence of the contract
might elicit people to do it changed
their behavior.
Also kind of dangerous, like, you know,
what is where do you where is the line?
The ladder seems highly at risk of, you
know, being susceptible to tribulation,
which we do have authority to reject.
I think with other categories,
assassination and the like, there is
authority within our statutes to
prohibit.
So we would exercise that authority.
You know, there are certain areas where
we certainly would not want contracts
being offered, but with others, look,
we're not, as I said, a regulator.
We're not going to go and say you can't
have a contract in sports, You can't
have a contract in politics.
But the details matter and we are
evaluating that.
Just going back to, you know, the sort
of basic question.
A lot of states, attorneys generals are
are attorneys general.
Did I say that I plural attorneys for a
lot of states, attorneys general?
You know, there's a lot of court fights
about this.
And they look at this and like many
people would and they say, look, this is
this is betting, this is this is
gambling.
This certainly looks like sports
gambling.
Kalshi itself ran ads that said sports
betting is now legal in your state.
And I think they've pulled those back,
etc..
But from the perspective of the public,
it certainly looks like by calling, by
putting sports betting into this
framework that a lot of like that it's
undermined the ability of states to set
the rules about who can bet on what.
Well, there's a great law Journal
article by Professor Hayes and he's a
securities law professor.
This must have been written in the early
2000, but it was before the financial
crisis comparing derivatives, futures
contracts, securities, insurance
products, gambling.
These are all products that you can take
similar economic positions in, but they
have different legal treatment.
And it's because the products are
structured in different ways.
So an insurance contract could be
structured very similarly to a credit
default swap, but you haven't insurable
interest.
So so the details do matter and we are
looking at that.
So it's not the case that we're going
into the casinos and saying you're
offering legal off exchange swaps.
But if the products are structured as
swaps, then we have authority there.
And so many of these platforms that are
offering products that may have some
similar economic attributes, but the
details do matter.
Right.
As I as I mentioned, you can you have to
go through a clearinghouse.
Yeah.
The products can be offset.
You can get in and out of your position.
There are different.
They matter.
I totally get that.
But do they matter from the perspective
of like a 19 year old who's addicted to
betting on sports?
Well, I think that's a question for
society as a whole and even for
Congress, right?
I mean, to the extent we don't want a 19
year old trading in video stock options
either, you know, that's that's
something that you can talk to Congress
about.
But the reality is that today we allow
18 plus in our financial markets and
there's a responsibility associated with
that.
They have to go through a broker in many
cases.
There is this nuance of the non
intermediated model, but there is
screening as well to be able to access
those markets.
And so we do have standards, we do have
rules.
Everything's done in accordance with an
exchange rulebook and we enforce that
and we are policing those markets.
But I think this this more paternalistic
question of what age should be the age
to be able to participate in the markets
and these people can be drafted, go off
to war.
And so a question of whether they can
trade options on the outcome of the
Super Bowl, you know, I think that's not
really for the regulator to decide.
You know, you said you were ramping up
staffing to help regulate all these new
markets, new and fast growing markets.
What's the hiring process or the hiring
experience actually like at the moment?
Because, you know, thinking back to last
year or 2025, all the headlines when it
came to government employment were, you
know, layoffs, mass firings,
streamlining.
What's what's that like for you now?
Is it easy to get people in the door?
Well, look, there are there are to the
extent there are areas where we need
additional staff.
We are evaluating based on competence
and the highest quality.
We do not want to to just bring on
bodies, to bring on bodies.
We're making sure that we're bringing on
the right people for the roles.
And in many cases we are very well
staffed.
I think there are some needs that we're
looking to fill out.
But but again, it's it's very much akin
to hiring at a private company or
looking to bring on the best and the
brightest who really want to help
revitalize the agency fill out needs for
the agency.
And we are, as I mentioned earlier,
relying a lot on technology as well,
because there's just so much that many
years ago it really had to be done
manually.
That can be done very quickly through
new technologies.
Well, this has been a perennial
question, which is how government
agencies actually compete with the
private sector to get good people.
How are you doing that at the moment,
given that?
I mean, I imagine you have some form of
budget constraint and I would imagine
that it's probably your budget is not as
big as like, I don't know, CMS or
something like that.
How how do you actually compete?
Well, look, I think part of that's the
mission.
We are really interested in making sure
that these markets flourish here in the
United States.
It's an exciting time.
Many people are interested in being able
to contribute to that effort where
really, as I said earlier, setting new
market structure for this asset class as
well as for for blockchain based Marquez
and a lot of the things that needed to
be fixed in the wake of Dodd-Frank that
frankly were never fixed.
So I think it's in part mission and part
people that are willing to serve and
come in and maybe they don't get the
salary that they get in the private
sector, but that's not necessarily a bad
thing.
They get a lot of value out of being it
working for the government.
Do you think going back to the question
of like marketing and again, gambling
marketing, there's always like some line
or whatever about people who get
addicted.
Would you like Congress to come in and
create rules?
Should Congress come up with a rule
about prediction market advertising?
We have got a lot of authority to
regulate our participants.
I think there's sometimes a real need
for Congress to the extent, as you all
mentioned, if you really want to set
some sort of more paternalistic role
around, you have to be 18 or 21 to
participate in the markets, that sort of
thing.
Sure, you can talk to Congress about
with respect to the more nuanced pieces
of how we regulate the markets, that's
stuff that we handle.
It's not typically baked into statute.
We go through our notice and comment
process and get input from the public on
those sorts of things.
So I don't necessarily think you need to
kick everything the Congress within the
details.
But but but it certainly could be
something that people in a lot of
countries, you know, we're sorry, a lot
of states regard like, okay, under 21
like we don't want that Right.
And it sounds like you regard that as
paternalism in action, which, you know,
I understand a lot of people share that
view.
But, you know, it also seems like the
CFTC, you know, people have different
views and it sounds like the CFTC is
sort of undermining a value that a state
might have about gambling.
I don't view it that way.
I do think our derivatives markets are a
separate area within government and
within the law as opposed to the state
gambling and the.
The rules and requirements that govern a
state casino are very different.
They can do a lot different things than
what a regulated futures exchange can
do.
And so I do think there's some give and
take, some for sure limitation on the
age piece.
But look, you can serve alcohol in a
casino and allow people to bet on
sports.
You can't do that necessarily at a
digital exchange.
Maybe somebody has got a beer on the
side.
But I do think there's a lot of
different restrictions and a different
environment in which people are trading.
So it's not quite apples to apples.
Mike Selig, thank you so much for
coming on Odd Lots.
a perfect guest at the perfect
time.
Thanks for having me.
I enjoyed that conversation too.
However, there are a number of
difficulties with regulating prediction
markets and I'm kind of trying to like
zoom in on what I think might be the
primary one.
So, number one, the CFTC exists to
regulate risk management, right?
Which is what Mike said.
It is very doubtful to me that someone
needs to manage their exposure to Cardi
B performing on stage at the Super Bowl.
So it's not even entirely clear to me
that, like, this is an industry that the
CFTC should be regulating now.
That said.
So that's that's a big tangent.
Yeah, right.
And then just beyond that, you could
certainly argue that by legitimizing
prediction markets and helping them to
grow, you are in fact introducing a new
risk into the system because everyone's
going to start gambling away.
I don't know, they're college funds or
whatever.
You know, I think Mike made an
interesting observation and sort of near
the end of the conversation that like
and until it was like different market
structures warrant different types of
regulatory treatment.
Right.
So and I think that makes sense.
I think what's interesting, though,
about this conversation, particularly as
it relates to sports betting, is that
part of the reason that we hear that
states have sort of in many cases,
either no sports betting or very
stringent rules about who can engage in
sports betting has nothing to do with
financial risk and everything to do with
the sort of like moral choice about who
gets to sports bet.
And so, you know, on one hand it's like,
okay, there's like traditional sports
books.
They have a house that sets the odds.
It's definitely true that prediction
market companies have like a different
market structure, but from a sort of
like, why do society want to constrain
the role of sports betting?
It's not because of like any sort of
like financial instability risk.
It's because we don't want certain
people like 18 year old people who might
still be in high school having access to
sports betting.
And when the CFTC says, like, you know,
this is this is a new type of financial
instrument that should be regulated like
a financial instrument, it sort of
undercuts that sort of choice that the
state has made.
Yeah, exactly.
Do you think sports betting is like the
new monoculture?
I mean, it's just really incredible.
I mean, it is really incredible how
pervasive it is.
An incredible but also it's just
incredible, you know, truly how
pervasive betting on everything is.
And, you know, I should say, like I I'm
an enthusiastic consumer of the
prediction markets data.
You know, like I said in the very
beginning, like I now on all kinds of
things, including fed decisions, you
know, like I think it's very useful to
say like you look at like certain
measures of like I don't know, you know,
the Fed funds swaps or whatever.
It's like you just look at worth.
No, I like I like I love work, too, but
like a simple we have it on the
Bloomberg now poly market.
Will there be three rate cuts this year?
That is also a useful instrument to
have.
But there are a lot of things the
prediction markets have and again that a
are that.
But I you know I like a lot of them I
like looking at election odds.
I like looking at whether the odds of
like some company what they're going to
like.
I think there's a lot of useful signal
from them.
It's also true that the platforms are
largely sports betting at this point.
Right.
Right.
How much signal do you actually need
about I don't know, the Super Bowl?
I'm sure some people are really into it.
But from a yeah, trading from a sort of
from a financial regulation standpoint,
it's a different question.
Yeah.
Anyway, all right.
Shall we leave it there?
And it's also true, by the way, that the
Trump family is very invested, quite
literally into this space.
And I think that quite reasonably
should, you know, raise some questions
about like how policy is being made
about the growth of this industry.
Incentives.
Yeah, for sure.
Okay.
Shall we now leave it there.
Let's leave it there.
Okay.
