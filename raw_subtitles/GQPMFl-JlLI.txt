Hi
 everybody
 and
 welcome
 to
 In
 Good


Company
 and
 today
 we
 are
 live
 from
 New


York.
 Now
 the
 first
 thing
 I
 did
 when
 I


arrived
 was
 to
 change
 my
 SIM
 card
 in
 my


phone
 to
 an
 AT&T
 SIM
 card.


>> Thank
 you
 for
 that
 next


>> and
 so
 therefore
 it's
 kind
 of
 fun
 to
 be


here
 with
 the
 CEO
 of
 the
 whole
 company


AT&T.


>> It's
 good
 to
 be
 with
 you
 and
 thank
 you


for
 changing
 your
 SIM
 card
 to
 an
 AT&T


SIM
 card.
 Now,
 AT&T,
 American
 Telephone


and
 Telegraph
 Company,
 you
 know,
 founded


by
 Alexander
 Graham
 Bell
 going
 back
 to


like
 1877.
 That's
 quite
 a
 history,


right?


>> We're
 just
 about
 on
 year
 150s
 next
 year.


So,
 it's
 a
 big
 deal.


>> Now,
 telecom
 industry
 has
 always
 been


fascinating
 and
 interesting,
 but
 what's


interesting
 for
 you
 in
 the
 industry


right
 now?
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 two
 things


that
 are
 really
 important
 in
 the
 United


States
 because
 of
 what
 came
 after
 the


telecom
 act
 which
 was
 a
 attempt
 to


deregulate
 all
 the
 various
 forms
 of


communication.


>> We're
 now
 seeing
 technology
 actually


achieve
 that.
 There's
 real
 intermodal


competition
 between
 wireless
 and
 fixed


and
 satellite.
 And
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that,


there's
 a
 reordering
 of
 assets
 going
 on


in
 the
 United
 States.
 And
 where
 we
 used


to
 have
 companies
 that
 focus
 maybe
 in


one
 technology
 branch
 or
 another,
 it's


now
 just
 about
 can
 you
 deliver
 a
 network


that
 gets
 customers
 on
 the
 internet
 and


can
 you
 do
 it
 whether
 they
 need
 to
 be
 on


wireless
 or
 a
 fixed
 connection
 or


through
 satellite
 and
 that
 reordering
 of


assets
 is
 pretty
 interesting
 because
 I


think
 it's
 going
 to
 readjust
 the
 winners


and
 losers
 in
 the
 market
 and
 that's


>> but
 but
 data
 traffic
 is
 exploding
 right


we
 are
 using
 it
 more
 and
 more
 and
 more


yet
 the
 telecom
 sector
 is
 kind
 of


certainly
 lagging
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the


max
 7
 and
 the
 big
 tech
 stocks.
 Why
 why


is
 that?


>> Well,
 that's
 uh
 clearly
 the
 value
 ad
 on


the
 high
 margin
 products.
 When
 somebody


can
 carve
 out
 a
 dominant
 market


position,
 they
 tend
 to
 drive
 better


margins
 than
 the
 Magnificent
 Seven
 have


managed
 to
 do
 that
 in
 each
 of
 their


segments.
 In
 our
 case,
 we're
 pretty


competitive
 industry
 and
 as
 a
 result
 of


that,
 we
 tend
 to
 grow
 at
 GDP
 or
 GDP
 a


little
 bit
 plus
 and
 um
 our
 ability
 to


kind
 of
 carve
 that
 same
 uh
 dominant


position
 at
 large
 margins
 just
 hasn't


arrived
 at
 this
 point.
 Having
 said
 that,


the
 next
 exciting
 part
 about
 the


industry
 is
 the
 fact
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to


drive
 another
 growth
 cycle
 in
 data
 and


usage
 demand.


>> And
 we
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 unique


opportunity
 for
 growth
 in
 our
 business


moving
 forward.
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 allow


for
 that
 consistent
 uh
 steady


improvement
 of
 cash
 flows
 if
 you
 invest


correctly
 during
 this
 change
 cycle


that's
 occurring
 right
 now.


>> So
 so
 how
 should
 we
 look
 at
 the


relationship
 between
 the
 explosive


growth
 in
 data
 and
 the
 providers
 of
 the


infrastructure?
 Well,
 I
 think
 what
 um


you
 know
 for
 many
 years
 people
 are


saying
 are
 you
 going
 to
 be
 able
 to


profitably
 grow
 as
 consumption
 continues


to
 grow
 and
 that's
 really
 been
 going
 on


for
 decades
 and
 I
 would
 say
 that
 the


data
 points
 over
 the
 last
 number
 of


years
 have
 shown
 that
 despite
 the
 fact


that
 consumers
 have
 an
 insatiable
 demand


to
 use
 more
 and
 more
 data
 by
 the
 virtue


of
 technology
 operating
 our
 business


more
 effectively
 the
 ability
 for
 us
 to


add
 value
 into
 products
 and
 price


differently
 we
 are
 driving
 solid
 returns


in
 our
 business
 And
 I
 do
 expect
 that's


going
 to
 continue
 moving
 forward,


especially
 as
 we
 see
 more
 convergence
 of


customers
 buying
 services
 from
 one


company
 across
 multiple
 networks
 and


your
 ability
 to
 be
 even
 more
 efficient


and
 more
 effective
 at
 monetizing
 that


household.


>> Now,
 if
 we
 go
 back
 some
 years
 to
 um


2016,
 you
 you
 bought
 Warner
 Media.
 At


that
 stage,
 one
 thought,
 okay,
 we
 need


to
 combine
 content
 and
 distribution.


>> And
 then
 um
 one
 realized
 that
 uh
 you


know
 that
 that
 wasn't
 a
 particularly


good
 idea.
 But
 when
 you
 look
 back
 and


that
 at
 that
 what
 what
 was
 the
 learnings


from
 that
 in
 a
 way?


>> There's
 there's
 several.
 Um
 one
 is
 I


would
 tell
 you
 uh
 when
 you
 think
 about


changing
 a
 traditional
 business
 model


and
 having
 to
 reposition
 it,
 you
 best
 be


in
 a
 position
 to
 invest
 heavily
 to
 make


that
 happen.
 And
 and
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


learnings
 was
 media
 was
 going
 through


its
 own
 uh
 repositioning
 and
 the


re-engineering
 that
 was
 necessary
 in
 the


business
 model.
 And
 certainly
 as
 we
 just


discussed,
 telecommunications
 was
 seeing


the
 same
 thing.
 And
 in
 today's


competitive
 environment,
 if
 you're
 not


investing
 aggressively
 to
 kind
 of
 win
 in


a
 space,
 it's
 really
 hard
 to
 be


successful.
 And
 on
 anybody's
 uh
 public


balance
 sheet,
 trying
 to
 reposition
 in


two
 industries
 at
 the
 same
 time
 probably


requires
 more
 cash
 and
 more
 patience


than
 what
 the
 public
 markets
 are
 willing


to
 offer.


>> You
 decided
 to
 divest
 the
 content


business.
 Uh
 how
 did
 you
 come
 up
 with


that?
 It
 was
 necessary.
 It
 was
 uh
 in


order
 for
 us
 to
 be
 really
 good
 at
 our


core
 business,
 which
 was
 connectivity.


Um
 given
 what
 was
 going
 on
 in
 the


industry
 that
 we
 just
 discussed,


reinvestment,
 repositioning,
 interotal


competition,
 we
 had
 to
 step
 up
 our


investments.
 We
 had
 to
 get
 better
 at


what
 we
 were
 doing.
 And
 I
 think
 today,


one
 thing
 we
 know
 about
 customers
 is


they
 have
 a
 low
 tolerance
 for
 less
 than


a
 great
 product.
 And
 that's
 certainly


something
 the
 internet
 has
 shown
 us
 all.


And
 as
 things
 have
 become
 much
 more


dynamic
 and
 switching
 costs
 are
 lower,


customers
 are
 going
 to
 go
 where
 they
 get


the
 best


>> best
 product
 and
 the
 best
 deal.
 We
 had


to
 reinvest
 in
 our
 business
 to
 make
 that


happen.


>> How
 intolerant
 are
 customers
 now?


Because
 I
 don't
 know
 how
 into
 I
 know


exactly
 how
 intolerant
 I
 am
 if
 I
 don't


get
 in
 touch,
 you
 know,
 within
 whatever.


Just
 how
 what's
 the
 what's
 what's
 kind


of
 the
 time
 lag
 that
 customers
 are


accepting
 now?


>> Yeah,
 I
 think
 it
 depends
 on
 the
 product.


I
 think
 our
 product,
 you
 know,


fortunately
 is
 viewed
 as
 a
 staple
 in


somebody's
 life.
 It's
 so
 critical
 to


them
 and
 frankly
 they
 invest
 a
 fair


amount
 every
 month.
 So
 we're
 not
 the
 $5


subscription.
 You
 know,
 we
 are
 the
 one


where
 they
 have
 to
 give
 some
 very


careful
 thought
 to
 having
 a


relationship.
 So
 maybe
 they're
 a
 bit


more
 tolerant
 of
 our
 our
 missteps
 if
 we


demonstrate
 to
 them
 that
 we
 understand


who
 they
 are
 and
 we
 give
 them
 a
 good


product
 the
 vast
 majority
 of
 the
 time.


But
 uh
 frankly
 the
 you
 know
 what
 used
 to


be
 in
 this
 industry
 where
 there's
 a
 lot


of
 switching
 inertia
 is
 not
 the
 case


anymore.
 You
 started
 this
 out
 by
 talking


about
 the
 fact
 that
 you
 showed
 up
 in


town
 and
 you
 popped
 a
 new
 SIM
 card
 in


your
 phone
 and
 you
 were
 on
 our
 network.


And
 if
 you're
 upset
 about
 what
 happens


tomorrow
 with
 our
 services,
 you
 may
 go


get
 a
 SIM
 card
 from
 somebody
 else
 and


pop
 it
 in
 your
 phone.


>> So
 when
 you
 when
 you
 have
 a
 telephone


and
 you
 make
 a
 call,
 what
 what
 is
 your


acceptance?
 you
 know,
 how
 long
 do
 you


accept
 it
 to
 take
 before
 you're


connected
 to
 the
 other
 end?


>> Well,
 in
 my
 case,
 I
 have
 very
 high


standards
 and
 if
 I
 that's
 what
 I
 assume


if
 it's
 not
 happening
 instantaneously.


I'm
 on
 the
 phone
 with
 somebody.
 I
 was
 in


a
 far
 part
 of
 New
 York
 this
 morning


where
 I
 wasn't
 particularly
 happy
 with


what
 I
 was
 seeing
 with
 some
 of
 my


throughput
 characteristics
 and
 I
 I
 was


back
 on
 the
 phone
 with
 somebody.


>> Now,
 you've
 been
 at
 AT&T
 for
 40
 years.


What
 was
 your
 first
 telephone?


I
 my
 very
 first
 telephone
 when
 I
 went
 to


college
 and
 I
 stood
 in
 line
 for
 about
 5


hours
 to
 get
 a
 princess
 phone
 to
 put
 in


my
 dorm
 room.
 My
 first
 wireless
 phone
 uh


was
 a
 uh
 it
 was
 an
 oy
 car
 mounted
 device


that
 went
 in
 the
 trunk
 of
 the
 car
 and


and
 sat
 on
 the
 console
 of
 the
 car
 and
 uh


I
 thought
 that
 was
 the
 best
 thing
 since


sliced
 bread
 when
 it
 showed
 up
 in
 my


life.


>> Well,
 it
 was
 right.


>> Yeah,
 it
 was.


>> Well,
 what
 a
 journey.
 Uh,
 do
 you
 think


AT&T
 would
 be
 anything
 else
 but
 a
 pure


communication
 utility?


>> Do
 I
 I
 first
 of
 all
 I
 don't
 think
 about


us
 as
 a
 utility.
 I
 think
 about
 us
 as
 a


networking
 company
 and
 I
 think
 we
 do


some
 pretty
 sophisticated
 networking.
 It


has
 to
 customize
 what
 we
 do
 for
 a
 lot
 of


fairly
 complex
 customers
 like
 large


enterprises.
 And
 I
 do
 believe
 that
 we


have
 an
 opportunity
 to
 move
 a
 little
 bit


right
 and
 left
 of
 our
 core
 connectivity


business
 with
 a
 combination
 of
 value


added
 services
 on
 top
 of
 those
 networks.


And
 um
 as
 we
 complete
 our
 migration
 into


a
 softwaredriven
 network,
 our
 ability
 to


begin
 building
 verticals
 and
 products


that
 are
 software
 driven
 on
 top
 of
 our


network
 gets
 a
 lot
 better.
 And
 so
 those


would
 be
 things
 like
 can
 we
 begin
 to


offer
 enhanced
 security
 services
 that


are
 software
 driven
 on
 top
 of
 the


network
 that
 allows
 us
 to
 move
 maybe


laterally
 into
 security
 on
 top
 of


connectivity.
 M


>> we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 when
 you
 think


about
 AI
 driving
 performance
 and


workload.
 There
 are
 things
 that
 we
 can


do
 to
 ensure
 that
 we're
 delivering


quality
 of
 service
 at
 a
 bit
 level
 across


different
 network
 fabrics
 that
 I
 think


will
 be
 incremental
 opportunities
 for


revenue
 that
 we
 can
 bring
 in.
 We're


starting
 to
 work
 with
 players
 in
 the


industry
 that
 allow
 us
 to
 do
 things
 like


bring
 security
 and
 privacy
 services
 into


the
 market
 that
 allow
 parents
 to
 manage


their
 relationship
 of
 with
 their


children
 and
 how
 their
 children
 see


content
 and
 have
 insights
 to
 those


things.
 Those
 are
 all
 extensions
 that


are
 built
 on
 top
 of
 the
 core
 network
 and


I
 do
 believe
 we
 can
 grow
 revenues
 and


opportunities
 to
 grow
 the
 business
 a


little
 bit
 faster
 as
 a
 result
 of
 that.


you've
 stayed
 in
 North
 America
 whilst


you
 compete
 with
 some
 folks
 who
 are
 more


kind
 of
 diversified
 globally.
 What
 are


the
 what's
 the
 thinking
 behind
 staying


here?


>> That's
 a
 really
 good
 question.
 I
 would


tell
 you
 at
 one
 point
 in
 my
 career
 there


was
 a
 desire
 to
 move
 beyond
 North


America
 and
 did
 a
 lot
 of
 work
 around


that
 and
 I
 think
 that
 was
 at
 a
 time


where
 maybe
 um
 in
 many
 countries
 there


was
 some
 flexibility
 around
 foreign


ownership
 starting
 to
 to
 manifest


itself.
 Um
 I
 would
 say
 the
 last
 couple


years
 that
 has
 reversed
 itself.
 I
 see


more
 of
 a
 balkcanization
 going
 on
 where


many
 countries
 are
 becoming
 much
 more


sensitive
 around
 foreign
 ownership
 of


critical
 assets.
 Um
 in
 addition,
 if
 you


just
 kind
 of
 go
 around
 the
 world
 and
 say


where
 are
 competitive
 returns
 achieved


in
 telecommunications,


the
 United
 States
 stands
 above
 every


place
 else.
 They've
 gotten
 policy
 and


approach
 to
 telecom,
 right?
 And
 it's


really
 hard
 to
 find
 another
 market
 to
 go


into
 to
 say
 I
 can
 go
 and
 get
 as
 good
 a


return
 in
 that
 particular
 country
 as
 I


can
 in
 the
 United
 States
 when
 in
 fact
 we


have
 more
 organic
 growth
 opportunities


in
 the
 US.
 That's
 why
 we're
 investing
 so


heavily
 in
 fiber
 and
 building
 our


footprint
 and
 starting
 to
 build
 outside


of
 some
 of
 the
 traditional
 markets
 that


we've
 operated
 in
 because
 we
 think
 we


can
 get
 better
 returns
 here.


>> Well,
 you
 are
 it's
 it's
 it's
 a
 very
 big


market,
 right?
 So
 you
 look
 at
 Europe,


you
 have
 there's
 been
 a
 competition


policy
 that
 you
 should
 have
 three


players
 in
 each
 country
 and
 you
 got
 like


close
 to
 30
 countries.
 So
 that's
 uh


that's
 a
 lot
 of
 operators.
 Uh


>> and
 there's
 actually
 very
 few
 countries


of
 scale
 in
 the
 in
 in
 Europe
 that
 have


three
 players.
 Many
 of
 them
 have
 four


moving
 to
 three.


>> Yeah.
 And
 uh
 you
 also
 have
 some
 dynamics


there
 that
 are
 a
 little
 bit
 different
 on


on
 how
 roaming
 gets
 done
 and
 two
 layers


of
 regulation
 between
 the
 country
 and


the
 EU.


>> So
 when
 you
 sit
 here,
 you
 know,
 we
 are


in
 New
 York
 and
 you
 look
 to
 Europe,
 what


are
 your
 what
 are
 your
 reflections
 when


you
 look
 at
 the
 European
 telecom
 market?


>> I
 I
 think
 it's
 sad.
 Uh
 candidly,
 I
 think


you
 have
 a
 developed
 uh
 set
 of
 economies


that
 are
 basically
 on
 third
 world


communications
 infrastructure
 in
 many


instances.
 Maybe
 not
 the
 case
 in
 Norway,


but
 there
 are
 parts
 of
 Europe
 where


services
 are
 are
 clearly
 a
 step
 behind


much
 of
 the
 rest
 of
 the
 developed
 world


right
 now.
 My
 sense
 is
 in
 talking
 to


policy
 makers
 in
 Europe,
 they
 they
 get


that
 and
 that's
 why
 there
 is
 this
 move


to
 maybe
 go
 to
 a
 three-player
 structure


that
 inense
 more
 investment
 in


infrastructure.
 And
 I
 believe
 if
 they


move
 forward
 on
 that
 and
 they
 do
 it


quickly
 that
 you
 can
 fact
 see
 a


reinvestment
 cycle
 that
 will
 improve


services
 in
 Europe
 uh
 pretty


significantly.


>> So
 when
 you
 say
 you
 think
 it's
 uh
 it's


not
 so
 great
 that's
 because
 of
 the


technical
 offering
 or
 is
 it
 because
 of


profitability
 of
 the
 players
 or


>> players
 aren't
 getting
 return
 on
 capital


therefore
 they
 don't
 want
 to
 reinvest
 in


capital
 in
 their
 infrastructure
 and


networks.


>> How
 do
 we
 see
 that
 European
 players
 are


behind
 the
 US?
 I
 would
 just
 go
 look
 at


what
 uh
 customers
 get
 in
 terms
 of
 data


quality
 throughput
 and
 the
 advance
 of


services
 what's
 available
 in
 terms
 of


you
 know
 is
 state-of-the-art
 5G
 and
 are


is
 the
 performance
 of
 those
 networks


what
 you
 would
 see
 in
 Asia
 or
 in
 the
 US


in
 consistently
 as
 I
 move
 through
 Europe


that's
 not
 the
 case


>> tell
 me
 about
 your
 fiber
 buildouts
 why


why
 is
 that
 so
 good


>> look


>> why
 is
 it
 better
 than
 putting
 up
 mobile


towers


>> fiber
 when
 you
 think
 about
 running


networks
 I
 don't
 like
 to
 think
 about


wireless
 or
 fixed.
 My
 belief
 is


everything's
 a
 fiber
 network
 with


different
 access
 technology
 hanging
 on


the
 end
 of
 it.


>> Sometimes
 it's
 a
 cell
 tower,
 as
 you
 just


said.
 Sometimes
 it's
 a
 jack
 on
 the
 wall


that
 something
 plugs
 directly
 into
 like


a
 wireless
 router.


>> Sometimes
 it's
 a
 hardwired
 connection


into
 a
 hyperscaler's
 environment.


>> But
 it
 all
 starts
 with
 fiber.
 and
 in


particular
 why
 fiber
 is
 so
 critical


moving
 forward
 in
 the
 AI
 world
 is
 most


high
 bandwidth
 networks
 today
 especially


for
 the
 consumer
 space
 have
 been
 built


asymmetrical
 more
 downstream
 bandwidth


than
 upstream
 bandwidth
 one
 of
 the


things
 that
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 drive
 is
 more


upstream
 traffic
 and
 the
 requirements
 to


move
 into
 a
 hyperscalers
 environment
 to


get
 to
 large
 language
 models
 to
 do
 the


processing
 of
 data
 and
 information
 in
 an


AI
 world
 is
 going
 to
 require
 a
 lot
 more


upstream
 bandwidth.
 So
 more
 symmetrical


networks,
 fiber
 is
 symmetrical.
 And
 so


the
 faster
 you
 get
 a
 bit
 of
 traffic
 onto


fiber,
 the
 more
 capacity
 you
 have,
 not


only
 down
 but
 up,
 and
 the
 more
 ability


you
 have
 to
 manage
 the
 performance
 of


that
 bit.


>> So
 when
 you
 look
 at
 5G
 and
 6G,
 you
 don't


think
 that's
 a
 competition
 to
 fiber.
 You


think
 it's
 just
 a
 feed
 into
 your
 fiber?


>> Yeah,
 I
 don't
 think
 it's
 competition.


And
 I
 think
 it's
 just
 another
 access


technology
 where
 in
 some
 cases
 5G
 and
 6G


are
 the
 best
 way
 in
 a
 wide
 area
 network


to
 get
 somebody
 on
 a
 high
 bandwidth


network.
 But
 there
 are
 times
 where
 other


access
 technologies
 like
 Wi-Fi
 or
 being


actually
 hardwired
 into
 the
 network
 are


necessary
 depending
 on
 the
 performance


that's
 required.


>> You
 bought
 some
 um
 spectrum
 frequencies


uh
 lately.
 How
 is
 that
 going
 to
 benefit


you?
 Well,
 it's
 going
 right
 at
 what
 we


just
 talked
 about
 where
 if
 you
 believe


workloads
 are
 going
 to
 increase,
 these


are
 going
 to
 dramatically
 improve
 our


throughput
 on
 our
 wireless
 network
 that


will
 enable
 some
 of
 these
 applications


to
 pop
 up.
 And
 in
 particular,
 some
 of


the
 spectrum
 we
 bought
 was
 lowband


spectrum
 that
 the
 way
 it
 can
 be


engineered
 is
 effectively
 making
 sure


there's
 a
 more
 robust
 upstream
 channel


into
 the
 network.
 Um
 so
 the
 difference


between
 the
 two
 types
 of
 technology


that's
 used
 on
 spectrum
 TDD
 and
 FDD
 the


TDD
 spectrum
 that
 uh
 that
 lowband


spectrum
 has
 allows
 you
 to
 engineer
 the


upstream
 more
 aggressively
 and
 we
 think


that
 plays
 very
 well
 into
 what
 the


future
 of
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 require
 of


mobile
 networks.


>> What
 about
 cyber?
 Is
 cyber
 close
 to


revenue
 opportunity
 for
 you?
 Is
 it
 good


or
 bad
 news?


>> It's
 a
 it's
 a
 thing
 that
 keeps
 me
 up
 at


night.
 There's
 not
 many
 things
 that
 keep


me
 up
 at
 night.
 Um,
 so
 I
 I
 think
 the


notion
 of
 building
 secure
 networks
 right


now
 and
 doing
 it
 in
 the
 geopolitical


environment
 we're
 operating
 in
 is
 a
 real


challenge


>> and
 we
 spend
 a
 significant
 amount
 of


money
 within
 our
 business
 to
 make
 sure


we
 offer
 secure
 networks.
 Having
 said


that,
 my
 my
 concerns
 about
 running
 a


large
 public
 network
 are
 shared
 by
 every


CEO
 and
 every
 CIO
 at
 every
 company
 uh


around
 the
 globe.
 And
 so
 there
 is
 an


opportunity
 for
 us,
 as
 I
 said
 earlier,


>> to
 extend
 our
 basic
 connectivity


services
 to
 help
 folks
 manage
 their


networks
 more
 effectively.


>> Since
 we
 do
 things
 like
 monitoring
 our


network,
 looking
 for
 patterns
 and


changes
 in
 behavior
 and
 and
 trying
 to


hunt
 the
 bad
 guys
 actively
 day
 in
 and


day
 out,
 we
 can
 extend
 that
 onto
 some
 of


our
 customers
 networks.
 And
 that's
 where


us
 extending
 into
 other
 products
 and


services
 that
 are
 softwarebased,
 I


think,
 opens
 up
 an
 opportunity
 for
 us
 to


grow
 new
 revenues
 as
 well.
 So,
 I
 see
 it


as
 both.
 It's
 a
 cost
 because
 we've
 got


to
 make
 sure
 we
 run
 our
 business


effectively,
 but
 that
 cost
 is
 something


that
 every
 business
 out
 there
 is


enduring
 and
 we
 can
 help
 them
 do
 it
 more


efficiently
 and
 probably
 get
 renumerated


for
 it.


>> So,
 hunting
 the
 bad
 guys,
 what
 does
 that


involve?
 What
 are
 the
 what
 are
 the


weapons?


>> Depends
 on
 the
 day
 of
 the
 week.
 Uh,
 and


you
 know,
 it's
 it's
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 a
 an


imbalanced
 fight,
 right?
 We're
 a
 where
 a


particular
 for-profit
 company
 that's


often
 times
 fighting
 nation
 state
 actors


that
 have
 no
 budget
 and
 they
 don't
 have


a
 P&L
 they
 have
 to
 report
 on
 or
 a


balance
 sheet
 they
 have
 to
 worry
 about


and
 they'll
 invest,
 you
 know,
 untold


amounts
 of
 money
 and
 creativity
 to
 try


to
 figure
 out
 how
 they
 infiltrate
 and


beat
 that
 down.
 So
 it
 requires
 a


tremendous
 amount
 of
 collaboration


requires
 collaboration
 not
 only
 within


our
 company
 but
 with
 government
 entities


our
 partners
 in
 the
 industry
 where
 we're


sharing
 our
 insights
 and
 knowledge.
 I


think
 it's
 only
 through
 that


collaboration
 that
 you
 can
 counter


somebody
 who's
 going
 to
 spend
 literally


billions
 and
 billions
 of
 dollars
 because


it's
 in
 a
 nation
 state
 interest
 to


figure
 out
 how
 to
 crack
 the
 code
 on
 on


compromising
 you.
 And
 uh
 if
 you
 don't


have
 everybody
 helping
 each
 other
 um


that
 are
 you
 that
 are
 aligned
 in
 a


common
 way
 then
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 a


very
 difficult
 time.
 Second
 thing
 is
 it


requires
 you
 to
 really
 work
 out
 with


those
 that
 are
 on
 the
 leading
 edge
 on


research
 and
 development
 and
 there
 are


especially
 in
 the
 United
 States
 some


companies
 and
 some
 entities
 that
 are


really
 really
 good
 at
 this
 kind
 of
 thing


and
 staying
 in
 tune
 with
 them
 to


understand
 what's
 next
 what's
 coming


around
 the
 corner
 what
 the
 next
 type
 of


vectors
 of
 attack
 are
 going
 to
 be
 and


how
 do
 you
 think
 about
 getting
 ahead
 of


the
 curve
 on
 those
 things
 is
 pretty


critical
 as
 well.


>> How
 do
 um
 satellites
 fit
 into
 the


competitive
 landscape
 here?
 satellites


for
 the
 most
 part
 I
 think
 are,
 you
 know,


they're
 first
 of
 all,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


amazingly
 encouraging
 to
 see
 the


innovation
 that
 LEO
 constellations


bring.
 I
 think
 they're
 going
 to
 change
 a


lot
 of
 things
 in
 our
 lives
 and
 uh
 I'm


excited
 about
 that
 innovation
 that's


going
 to
 come
 forward.
 I
 think
 we're


going
 to
 see
 truly
 the
 dawn
 of
 always
 on


connectivity
 and
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 good


for
 our
 business.
 I
 I
 think
 we're
 in
 a


position
 since
 we
 already
 have
 a


preferred
 relationship
 with
 customers
 to


manage
 their
 connectivity.
 were
 a


natural
 place
 to
 integrate
 satellite
 as


an
 additional
 add-on
 to
 their


connectivity
 relationships.


>> So
 when
 when
 will
 we
 see
 this
 kicking


in?


>> I
 think
 you're
 going
 to
 see
 a
 lot
 in


2026,
 next
 year,
 I
 think
 you're
 going
 to


start
 seeing
 real
 enduser
 services


coming
 about.
 And
 uh


>> so
 how
 am
 I
 going
 how
 am
 I
 going
 to


benefit
 from
 that?
 Well,
 you
 should


expect
 if
 you're
 a
 customer
 of
 AT&T
 that


you'll
 have
 an
 option
 to,
 for
 example,


if
 you're
 uh
 at
 a
 day
 where
 you're
 going


to
 drive
 off
 the
 network,
 maybe
 into
 the


Grand
 Canyon
 to
 go
 rafting
 and
 you
 want


to
 stay
 connected,
 that
 you'll
 be
 able


to
 buy
 a
 day
 pass
 to
 stay
 on
 the
 network


as
 a
 result
 of
 that.
 Or
 if
 you're


somebody
 who
 has
 a
 lifestyle
 that


requires
 you
 to
 always
 have
 that
 kind
 of


backup,
 maybe
 you
 boat
 on
 the
 weekends


and
 you
 go
 offshore,
 um
 maybe
 you
 have
 a


job
 that
 requires
 you
 to
 be
 in
 rural


places
 for
 oil
 drilling.
 You
 can
 buy
 a


subscription
 and
 have
 it
 all
 the
 time.


Uh
 but
 I
 think
 satellite
 is
 more


complimentary
 than
 directly
 competitive.


There'll
 be
 some
 overlap.
 Internet
 of


things,
 for
 example,
 in
 some
 cases,
 LEO


will
 be
 a
 better
 way
 to
 handle
 IoT
 type


arrangements
 that
 may
 supplant
 what
 a


terrestrial
 wireless
 network
 used
 to
 do.


But
 in
 many
 instances,
 it's
 going
 to
 be


complimementaryary
 and
 add-on
 to
 what


are
 always
 already
 robust
 high
 bandwidth


networks
 in
 the
 United
 States.
 John,


let's
 spend
 a
 bit
 more
 time
 on
 on
 AI.


How
 do
 you
 think
 that
 will
 increase
 data


volumes?


>> I
 think
 there's
 a
 couple
 things
 that


will
 drive
 it.
 The
 one
 that
 I'm
 probably


most
 excited
 about
 is
 if
 you
 kind
 of


look
 around
 your
 house
 or
 your
 car
 or


your
 workplace,
 there's
 sensors


everywhere
 today.
 And
 often
 times
 those


sensors
 are
 cameras.
 Um,
 certainly
 one


of
 the
 things
 that
 drove
 volume
 on
 the


network
 in
 the
 past
 was
 when
 we
 put


phones,
 we
 put
 cameras
 on
 every
 phone


>> and
 it
 was
 all
 the
 content
 that
 people


picked
 up
 on
 either
 video
 or
 taking


pictures
 and
 wanting
 to
 ship
 it
 around


that
 drove
 a
 lot
 of
 traffic
 on
 the


network.


>> When
 you
 start
 to
 think
 about
 all
 the


sensors
 that
 are
 capturing
 video
 right


now
 and
 you
 think
 about
 how
 capable
 AI


is
 in
 processing
 video
 and
 taking


insights
 from
 it,


>> I
 think
 that's
 one
 of
 the
 huge


opportunities.
 So
 when
 we
 talk
 about
 the


importance
 of
 upstream
 bandwidth,
 this


is
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 I
 believe
 we


should
 be
 investing
 in
 that
 upstream


bandwidth
 is
 because
 if
 all
 those


sensors
 are
 out
 there
 picking
 up
 the


video,
 it's
 got
 to
 get
 someplace
 to
 be


processed
 and
 analyzed.
 And
 that


upstream
 capability
 to
 get
 it
 back
 up


into
 the
 network,
 get
 it
 back
 up
 into


the
 hyperscaler
 LLM
 to
 be
 processed
 is,


I
 think,
 one
 of
 the
 places
 we're
 going


to
 see
 large
 upticks
 in
 traffic.
 And


then
 ultimately
 once
 it's
 a
 conclusion


or
 an
 inference
 is
 driven
 from
 it
 that


has
 to
 be
 delivered
 back
 to
 the
 point
 of


consumption
 quickly
 for
 somebody
 to
 make


a
 decision
 or
 do
 something
 with
 it.
 I


think
 that
 puts
 a
 tremendous
 amount
 of


uh
 lean
 on
 high
 performing
 networks
 and


that's
 really
 what
 we're
 attempting
 to


build
 in
 this


>> stupid
 question
 but
 how
 much
 of
 the


traffic
 through
 your
 networks
 would
 now


be
 pictures
 or
 video


>> in
 terms
 of
 the
 actual
 percentage
 today


video
 in
 total
 both
 downstream
 and


upstream
 drives
 over
 80%
 of
 the
 total


traffic
 on
 the
 network
 today


>> and
 much
 of
 that's
 entertainmentbased


video
 when
 you
 think
 about
 kind
 of
 in


the
 wireless
 space
 the
 4G
 revolution
 was


really
 geared
 off
 of
 consumers
 consuming


video
 for
 pleasure
 and
 entertainment.


>> And
 that's
 what
 drove
 massive
 amounts
 of


workloads
 onto
 the
 networks.
 I
 think
 in


the
 6G
 and
 AI
 world
 early
 on,
 we're


probably
 going
 to
 see
 enterprise


applications
 drive
 more
 of
 that
 increase


in
 demand
 on
 the
 network,
 but
 video
 is


still
 going
 to
 be
 a
 really
 important


part.


>> What's
 the
 biggest
 uh
 change
 from
 5G
 to


6G?
 Um,
 you
 know,
 I
 think
 what
 you're


going
 to
 see
 is
 that,
 uh,
 6G
 is
 going
 to


be
 very
 enterpriseoriented
 as
 opposed
 to


consumer
 oriented.
 It's
 going
 to
 allow


for
 the
 kind
 of
 management
 of
 networks


in
 the
 in
 the
 types
 of
 roundtrip
 latency


and
 performance
 that
 are
 necessary
 in
 an


AI
 world.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 add
 in


additional
 layers
 of
 security
 that
 have


not
 typically
 been
 available
 in
 wireless


networks
 that
 um
 are
 well
 tuned
 to
 the


threats
 that
 we
 see
 today.
 And
 I
 think


it
 will
 be
 scalable
 for
 the
 number
 of


devices
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 connected.


Um
 we're


>> are
 we
 going
 to
 feel
 any
 difference?
 uh


as
 a
 consumer
 I
 don't
 think
 you're
 going


to
 necessarily
 feel
 the
 network
 per
 se


being
 different
 but
 the
 applications


that
 you'll
 be
 able
 to
 operate
 and
 and


achieve
 if
 you're
 for
 example
 an


enterprise
 using
 a
 wireless
 network


those
 applications
 will
 be
 different
 and


better


>> can
 you
 deliver
 that
 increase
 in


capacity


>> can
 we
 deliver
 it
 yes
 I
 think
 we
 can
 I


think
 the
 United
 States
 in
 particular


was
 running
 a
 little
 bit
 behind
 on


getting
 the
 right
 amount
 of
 license


spectrum
 available
 to
 operators


Early
 on
 in
 the
 Trump
 administration,


there's
 been
 probably
 more
 work
 done
 in,


you
 know,
 a
 9-month
 period
 of
 time
 than


what
 was
 done
 in
 the
 previous
 four
 years


>> to
 have
 a
 roadmap
 of
 how
 to
 bring
 more


of
 that
 spectrum
 to
 market
 to
 ensure


that
 it
 those
 workloads
 can
 be
 handled.


I
 feel
 much
 better
 about
 it
 today
 based


on
 the
 actions
 that
 have
 been
 taken
 and


the
 path
 to
 uh
 spectrum
 auctions
 that


are
 going
 to
 be
 here
 that
 the
 US
 can


keep
 up
 with
 other
 key
 players
 around


the
 globe.
 I
 wouldn't
 have
 said
 that


probably
 18
 months
 ago.


>> Uh
 so
 I
 feel
 much
 more
 confident
 we'll


be
 in
 a
 better
 position.


>> When
 you
 um
 you
 have
 forward
 visibility


into
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 things
 that's


happening,
 right?
 Because
 you're
 a
 big


corporation
 partner
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 these


tech
 companies.
 What's
 the
 when
 you
 look


at
 the
 AI
 applications
 going
 forward?


What's
 what
 are
 you
 most
 excited
 about?


>> Well,
 there's
 there's
 things
 that
 we
 can


do
 inside
 our
 business
 that
 I
 get
 really


excited
 about
 that
 we're
 already
 proving


in.
 Um
 we've
 done
 a
 lot
 in
 customer


sales,
 service
 and
 support
 that
 has
 um


dramatically
 improved
 our
 customer


service,
 lowered
 our
 operating
 costs,


helping
 us
 reduce
 churn
 in
 places.
 Um


those
 kind
 of
 meat
 and
 potato
 things
 I


think
 most
 corporations
 are
 going
 to


have
 an
 opportunity
 to
 chase.


>> I
 see
 some
 great
 opportunities
 for
 us


and
 how
 we
 do
 pricing.
 Um,
 when
 you


think
 about
 what
 AI
 models
 can
 do
 and


how
 they
 inform
 what's
 going
 on


competitively
 in
 a
 particular
 area,
 much


more
 dynamic
 models
 of
 pricing
 as


compared
 to
 what
 have
 been
 more
 static


models
 that
 we've
 used.
 So,
 I'm
 really


excited
 about
 that.
 How
 we
 engineer


networks.
 Um,
 we
 were
 just
 I
 was
 going


through
 a
 set
 of
 projects
 earlier
 this


week
 about
 our
 ability
 now
 to
 literally


look
 at
 how
 traffic
 is
 moving
 in
 any


given
 moment
 in
 a
 city.
 If
 a
 marathon
 is


underway
 and
 and
 traffic
 people
 are


snaking
 through
 a
 city
 with
 different


demands
 at
 different
 parts
 of
 the
 city,


we
 can
 tune
 the
 network
 to
 follow
 that


demand
 and
 do
 it
 dynamically
 in
 real


time.
 Uh
 and
 AI
 is
 driving
 a
 lot
 of
 that


and
 that
 changes
 our
 engineering


practices
 and
 our
 deployment
 practices.


>> So
 what
 do
 you
 do
 with
 the
 network?
 So


let's
 say
 now
 you
 have
 the
 marathon,


right?
 You
 got
 uh
 50,000
 people
 running


a
 bus
 there.
 What
 do
 you
 So
 what
 do
 what


do
 you
 do
 with
 the
 network?
 So
 AI
 is


knows
 exactly
 the
 route
 of
 the
 marathon.


It
 takes
 it
 looks
 and
 takes
 uh
 pictures


of
 how
 many
 handsets
 or
 any
 particular


places.
 It
 evaluates
 where
 they're


moving.
 It
 knows
 the
 route.
 It
 knows
 how


it
 needs
 to
 tilt
 and
 move
 cell
 sites
 and


redirect
 them.
 So
 when
 the
 loads
 get


someplace,
 the
 cell
 towers
 are
 already


tuned
 and
 adjusted
 to
 where
 those
 loads


are
 going
 to
 be.
 And
 it's
 doing
 it


dynamically,
 literally
 following
 things.


And
 that's
 those
 kinds
 of
 things
 I
 think


are
 going
 to
 help
 service
 levels
 tremend


tremendously.
 We
 used
 to
 do
 some
 of
 that


stuff.
 It
 was
 labor
 intensive.
 We
 used


to
 have
 people
 sitting
 around
 at


keyboards
 adjusting.
 Now
 if
 it


dynamically
 occurs,
 we're
 more
 efficient


at
 getting
 it
 done.


>> Have
 you
 seen
 any
 new
 cool
 devices?
 You


know,
 I
 mean,
 you
 got
 the
 AI
 glasses,


you
 got
 uh
 well,
 OpenAI
 is
 talking
 about


some
 kind
 of
 new
 device.
 What's
 What
 are


the
 kind
 of
 things
 you've
 seen?
 Um,
 I've


seen
 the
 second
 generation
 of
 lenses,
 if


you
 want
 to
 call
 them
 glasses,
 that
 now


start
 to
 have
 some
 utility
 and
 you
 start


to
 look
 at
 what
 they're
 doing
 and


they're
 maybe
 not
 perfect
 right
 now,
 but


you
 can
 really
 start
 to
 see
 where
 as
 an


augment
 to
 your
 daily
 life,


>> they
 can
 add
 some
 value.
 And
 I
 think


another
 iteration
 of
 those
 uh
 could
 very


clearly
 start
 to
 change
 some
 things.


Form
 factor
 still
 needs
 to
 be
 worked
 on


a
 little
 bit.
 Ease
 of
 use
 still
 needs
 to


be
 looked
 at.
 But
 people
 who
 are


conversant
 using
 the
 technology
 can


actually
 do
 some
 pretty
 powerful
 things


with
 them.


>> And
 there's
 an
 example
 of
 if
 you
 know


some
 kind
 of
 a
 set
 of
 glasses
 or
 lenses


or
 a
 supplement
 for
 you
 as
 a
 screen
 uh


has
 to
 be
 connected
 that's
 good
 for
 our


business,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 absolutely.
 I
 have
 to
 say
 when


they
 first
 came
 out
 or
 when
 the
 first


generation
 came
 out,
 I
 was
 quite


skeptical,
 but
 now
 I
 think
 it'd
 be


pretty
 cool.
 They're
 getting
 there.
 And


they
 augmented,
 you
 know,
 if
 it's
 smart


enough
 and
 and
 AI
 is
 smart
 enough
 now
 to


listen,
 take
 context
 from
 speech
 where


you're
 not
 having
 to
 manipulate
 a
 user


interface
 or
 give
 it
 direction,
 but
 it


can
 intuitively
 know
 what
 you're


attempting
 to
 do
 at
 any
 given
 point
 in


time
 in
 a
 conversation.
 I
 do
 think
 there


can
 be
 some
 very
 powerful
 applications.


>> Why
 are
 you
 not
 investing
 in
 data


centers?


>> Um,
 look,
 we're
 if
 you
 think
 about


anything
 in
 tech,
 scale
 matters.
 Uh
 if


you
 build
 networks,
 scale
 matters.
 Uh


putting
 fiber
 out,
 scale
 matters.


Building
 data
 centers,
 and
 when
 you


think
 about
 how
 that's
 being
 done
 today,


which
 is
 chip
 design,
 uh
 it's
 your


ability
 to
 um
 have
 intellectual
 property


that
 allows
 you
 to
 network
 in
 that


structure
 very
 very
 differently.
 Um
 and


it's
 scale.
 There
 aren't
 going
 to
 be
 18


people
 building
 data
 centers.
 Is
 going


to
 be
 a
 handful,
 three,
 four.
 And


they're
 all
 doing
 it
 on
 native
 hardware.


They're
 doing
 it
 on
 native
 chip
 design.


That's
 a
 business
 that
 uh
 requires
 a


tremendous
 amount
 of
 investment
 and


requires
 a
 lot
 of
 investment
 cycles
 to


stay
 current.
 I
 have
 my
 hands
 full
 just


making
 sure
 that
 the
 fabric
 that


connects
 all
 those
 data
 centers
 is


state-of-the-art,
 scaled,
 and
 working


properly.


>> Do
 you
 think
 data
 centers
 will
 be
 a
 good


long-term
 investment
 for
 the
 people
 who


do
 them?


>> Um,
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 winners


in
 the
 AI
 space.
 I
 think
 there
 probably


are
 going
 to
 be
 fewer
 winners
 than
 the


number
 that
 are
 investing
 in
 it
 right


now.
 There's
 going
 to
 be
 some
 carnage.


>> Is
 there
 a
 bubble
 in
 there
 now?


>> Uh
 yeah,
 I
 think
 there's
 I
 think
 there's


a
 little
 bit
 of
 irrational
 exuberance


>> in
 some
 places.
 Um
 certainly
 when
 you


look,


>> you
 know,
 there's
 there's
 the


announcements
 and
 then
 there's
 the


reality.
 Yeah,


>> the
 announcements
 are
 pretty
 staggering.


Um
 those
 numbers,


>> you
 don't
 think
 those
 will
 come
 through?


Um
 I
 think
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a


limiting
 factor
 at least
 in
 the
 US


around
 how
 much
 power
 is
 available
 to


turn
 it
 all
 up


>> and
 I
 think
 that's
 going
 to
 become
 a


natural
 gating
 factor
 and
 I
 it's
 going


to
 be
 very
 hard
 to
 achieve
 all
 the


announcements
 that
 have
 been
 made
 unless


we
 get
 on
 a
 different
 growth
 curve
 for


the
 power
 infrastructure
 in
 this
 country


>> but
 with
 the
 speed
 of
 uh
 technology


development
 you
 need
 to
 depreciate
 these


assets
 over
 a
 relatively
 short
 time


frame
 right


>> I
 would
 think
 um
 and
 uh
 that
 that's
 my


view
 of
 when
 you
 look
 at
 the
 capital


intensity
 of
 building
 those
 data
 centers


and
 you
 look
 at
 the
 capital
 intensity
 of


my
 business,
 I'm
 I'm
 perfectly
 happy


staying
 in
 one
 domain.


>> How
 do
 you
 um
 build
 an
 AI
 culture
 within


AT&T?
 How
 do
 you
 get
 people
 to


experiment
 and
 adopt?


>> Um
 you
 know,
 I
 will
 um
 I'll
 weigh
 in
 on


that
 three
 years
 from
 now,
 maybe
 after


we
 get
 through
 it,
 but
 it's
 changing


culture
 is
 the
 hardest
 thing
 you
 do
 in
 a


company,
 especially
 an
 established


company.


>> Why
 is
 it
 so
 difficult?


>> They're
 people.
 And
 I
 think
 uh
 you
 know


people
 generally
 have
 their
 own


motivations
 and
 they
 have
 it's
 what's
 in


it
 for
 me
 and
 what's
 in
 my
 best
 interest


and
 how
 do
 I
 process
 on
 this
 and
 somehow


you
 got
 to
 get
 130,000
 people
 viewing


something
 in
 a
 common
 fashion


>> and
 um
 that's
 that's
 a
 hard
 thing
 to
 do.


What
 what
 we're
 doing
 is
 trying
 a
 couple


different
 approaches.
 We're
 using


incentives


uh
 and
 and
 giving
 people
 motivation
 to


want
 to
 embrace
 it
 and
 use
 it
 where
 it's


in
 their
 self-interest
 to
 do
 that


because
 of
 how
 they
 get
 paid
 or
 the


objectives
 they
 have
 in
 front
 of
 them.


We're
 using
 structures
 where
 we're


separating
 work
 groups
 from
 kind
 of
 the


BAU
 construct.
 Our
 business
 as
 usual


will
 pull
 people
 out
 and
 say
 you're


going
 to
 run
 a
 site
 operation.
 You're


going
 to
 be
 measured
 differently.
 You're


going
 to
 try
 to
 make
 this
 better
 by


inventing
 the
 new
 and
 you're
 not


encumbered
 by
 what
 we're
 doing
 today.


And
 we're
 testing
 processes
 that
 way.


We've
 built
 a
 center
 of
 excellence
 where


they're
 available,
 the
 expertise
 in
 AI


is
 available
 to
 anybody
 in
 the
 company


and
 they
 work
 out
 as
 consultants
 in
 the


company
 to
 adopt
 projects
 that
 people


want
 to
 carry
 forward
 where
 we're
 not


trying
 to
 build
 that
 expertise
 in
 too


many
 places
 where
 it
 gets
 diluted.
 And


we're
 finding
 partners
 to
 bring
 into
 the


company
 that
 want
 to
 build
 the
 next


platform
 that's
 an
 AI
 based
 platform
 and


need
 really
 hard
 test
 cases
 to
 do
 that.


So
 they
 come
 into
 AT&T
 and
 say
 let
 me


build
 you
 the
 finance
 department
 of
 the


future
 and
 we'll
 do
 that


collaboratively.
 We'll
 do
 that
 gratus


with
 you
 as
 long
 as
 the
 product
 that
 we


build
 we
 can
 go
 out
 and
 then
 use
 in


other
 companies
 and
 and
 sell
 it
 further.


And
 so
 we're
 using
 a
 variety
 of


different
 ways
 to
 get
 it.


>> Which
 part
 of
 the
 AT&T
 culture
 are
 you


trying
 to
 shift
 or
 move?


>> Um,
 you
 know,
 we're
 we
 have
 a
 lot
 of


things
 that
 are
 really
 good
 in
 our


culture.
 We
 don't
 you
 don't
 stay
 for
 150


years
 without
 doing
 something
 right
 and


we
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 employees
 that
 are


incredibly
 committed
 to
 the
 mission
 of


the
 business,
 which
 is
 to
 keep
 people


connected.
 Uh,
 and
 we've
 we
 do
 that
 in


ways
 that
 are
 in
 fact
 miraculous
 on


Sundays.
 And
 that's
 that's
 a
 really


important
 fabric
 of
 what
 we
 do.
 We
 need


to
 be
 a
 bit
 more
 agile
 and
 we
 need
 to
 be


a
 bit
 more
 market
 focused.
 And
 we
 need


to
 make
 sure
 that
 everybody
 who
 works
 at


our
 company
 is
 there
 because
 they're


committed
 to
 the
 mission.
 They're
 not


there
 because
 they
 feel
 like
 there's
 a


blind
 sense
 of
 loyalty
 to
 a
 pension
 plan


or
 or
 some
 other
 construct
 that
 um
 I
 I


want
 to
 work
 30
 years
 because
 there's


something
 there
 for
 me
 to
 work
 30
 years.


It's
 I
 really
 want
 to
 be
 here
 because
 I


believe
 in
 the
 mission
 of
 the
 company.


>> But
 I
 mean,
 you've
 been
 there
 for
 nearly


40
 years.
 So
 you
 kind
 of
 you
 epitomize


the
 AT&T
 culture.
 I
 you
 are
 Mr.
 AT&T,


right?


>> I
 I
 I
 don't
 I've
 never
 thought
 of
 myself


as
 Mr.
 AT&T,
 but
 I
 I
 think
 sometimes


>> Well,
 I
 mean,
 you
 brought
 up
 with
 a


culture
 you
 So,
 how
 can
 you
 change
 a


culture
 which
 you
 are
 part
 of?


>> I
 think
 you
 can
 go
 and
 look
 at
 research


and
 some
 would
 tell
 you
 that
 if
 you're


going
 to
 evolve
 and
 change
 a
 culture,


sometimes
 it's
 the
 disruptor
 from
 within


that
 can
 be
 the
 most
 effective
 as


opposed
 to
 the
 disruptor
 from
 outside.


And
 really
 that's
 the
 test
 that's
 in


front
 of
 me
 right
 now.
 Can
 I
 build
 a


more
 market-based
 culture
 that's
 more


focused
 on
 the
 customer
 and
 the
 customer


need
 and
 it
 works
 from
 the
 market
 back


into
 the
 company
 as
 opposed
 to
 one
 that


is
 been
 really
 built
 on
 we'll
 tell


consumers
 what
 they
 need.
 We'll
 tell


consumers
 what
 the
 next
 round
 of


technology
 is
 and
 then
 we'll
 take
 that


out
 to
 the
 market
 as
 opposed
 to
 really


understanding
 what
 the
 needs
 of
 the


market
 are
 and
 then
 engineering
 the


company
 to
 match
 those
 moving
 forward.


So
 when
 you
 took
 over
 as
 CEO,
 what
 were


your
 priorities?
 What
 did
 you
 want
 to


change?


>> Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 it
 was
 obviously
 to


get
 the
 company
 much
 more
 focused,
 which


we
 talked
 about
 around
 making
 some


decisions
 on
 the
 asset
 base
 and


investing.


>> Yeah,


>> it
 was
 to
 make
 it
 a
 lot
 more


cost-effective
 where
 we
 generated
 the


kind
 of
 cash
 that
 we
 could
 be
 leading


our
 industry
 in
 investment.
 That
 meant


we
 had
 to
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 cost
 out
 of
 the


business.
 We
 had
 to
 get
 out
 of
 a
 lot
 of


the
 legacy
 products
 and
 services
 we


have.


>> And
 we've
 been
 aggressively
 moving


through
 that.
 We're
 not
 done.
 We've
 got


another
 couple
 years
 of
 work
 to
 do


there,
 but
 that's
 helped
 us
 get
 cash


flows
 improved
 where
 we
 can
 reinvest
 at


the
 levels
 we're
 doing.
 And
 doing
 that


is
 to
 be
 the
 leader
 in
 building
 fiber


and
 having
 the
 most
 robust
 and
 capable


network
 infrastructure.
 So
 we've


invested
 at
 the
 top
 of
 the
 industry
 and


then
 working
 this
 cultural
 change
 that


is
 a
 change
 in
 us
 being
 much
 more


customer
 centric
 and
 customer
 focused


and
 elevating
 our
 game
 and
 supportive


customers
 including
 guaranteeing
 what


kind
 of
 service
 we'll
 provide
 to
 our


customers
 as
 the
 other
 aspect
 of


differentiating
 our
 services
 moving


forward
 and
 all
 those
 things
 have
 to


come
 together
 at
 the
 same
 time
 and
 it's


really
 been
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 5-year
 journey


that
 has
 a
 few
 more
 years
 left
 to
 go


before
 we
 get
 to
 where
 we
 need
 to
 be.


>> How
 long
 time
 does
 it
 take
 to
 change


global
 culture?
 I
 think
 it's
 I
 think


it's
 never
 ending.
 I
 I
 think
 you
 you


never
 get
 to
 a
 place
 where
 you
 say
 I
 can


stay
 here
 and
 even
 if
 you
 have
 a


productive
 and
 successful
 company,
 you


know,
 it's
 going
 to
 have
 to
 evolve
 and


change
 a
 little
 bit.
 Now
 maybe
 the
 rate


and
 pace
 that
 we
 have
 to
 achieve
 right


now
 is
 higher
 than
 the
 average.
 It's


maybe
 above
 average
 and
 what
 we
 need
 to


change
 in
 the
 period
 of
 time.
 But
 if
 you


ever
 say
 that
 I've
 got
 it
 right
 and
 I


don't
 need
 to
 worry
 about
 it
 ever


evolving
 again,
 I
 think
 that's
 probably


a
 a
 recipe
 for
 extinction.


>> But
 don't
 you
 think
 the
 speed
 of


required
 change
 is
 just
 going
 to


accelerate
 going
 forward?


>> Could
 Yeah,
 there's
 no
 doubt
 the
 level


of
 change
 we're
 all
 seeing.
 If
 you
 think


that
 AI,
 for
 example,
 if
 if
 we
 took
 us


25
 years
 to
 get
 to
 where
 we
 are
 on
 the


dawn
 of
 the
 internet
 and
 how
 it's


changed
 our
 business
 models
 and
 how
 we


operate,


AI
 will
 probably
 do
 the
 same
 in
 half
 the


amount
 of
 time.
 So,
 I
 think
 that
 will


require
 adjustment
 and
 change
 to


everybody's
 personal
 work
 habits,
 how


how
 work
 is
 arranged,
 how
 you
 think


about
 attacking
 markets.
 So,
 I
 do


believe
 it'll
 get
 faster
 and
 faster.


>> How
 would
 people
 characterize
 your


leadership
 style?


U
 I
 think
 what
 they
 would
 probably
 say


is
 I'm
 pretty
 direct.
 Um
 I'm
 pretty


clinical.
 Um
 they
 would
 uh
 people
 I've


had
 one
 boss
 who
 said
 you're
 a
 bit
 like


a
 fine
 wine.
 Um
 you
 want
 to
 buy
 it,
 hold


it,
 and
 then
 open
 it
 and
 appreciate
 it


for
 its
 complexity
 and
 what
 it's
 able
 to


do,
 but
 it
 takes
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 time
 to


get
 there.
 I
 think
 people
 see
 over
 time


that
 um
 I
 can
 be
 a
 pretty
 reliable


partner.
 Um
 I
 can
 be
 a
 trustworthy


partner.
 I
 can
 be
 somebody
 who
 uh
 is


incredibly
 not
 only
 committed
 to
 the


company
 but
 committed
 to
 the
 individuals


who
 want
 to
 see
 themselves
 step
 up
 and


raise
 the
 bar
 on
 their
 contributions
 and


performance
 to
 the
 business.
 And
 if
 that


>> Do
 you
 think
 you
 are
 respected
 more
 than


loved?


>> Um
 I
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 people
 use
 the


term
 loved
 to
 describe
 me.
 I
 think
 uh


generally
 speaking
 my
 goal
 is
 to
 be


respected.
 I
 think
 any
 CEO
 today
 because


of
 some
 of
 the
 things
 we're
 talking


about
 the
 rate
 and
 pace
 of
 change
 the


challenges
 that
 are
 in
 front
 of


especially
 established
 business
 models


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 hard
 decisions
 to
 be


made


>> absolutely
 life
 life
 is
 not
 a
 popularity


contest


>> and
 those
 hard
 decisions
 are
 usually


have
 some
 collateral
 damage
 in
 places


and
 over
 time
 hopefully
 investors


customers
 employees
 on
 par
 look
 at
 those


things
 and
 say
 I
 respect
 what
 was
 done


and
 it
 was
 necessary
 but
 you
 don't


always
 know
 that
 at
 the
 moment
 when


those
 decisions
 are
 being
 made,
 that's


sometimes
 perspective
 that
 takes
 a
 few


years
 to
 to
 develop.


>> Have
 you
 become
 a
 better
 leader
 with


age?


>> Um,
 in
 ways
 I
 become
 a
 better
 leader


with
 age.
 Certainly
 seasoning
 is


important.
 Um,
 I
 would
 tell
 you
 I
 think


anybody
 who
 doesn't
 understand
 that


these
 jobs
 have
 a
 physical
 demand
 that's


necessary.
 Uh,
 that
 physical
 demand,
 you


can
 do
 a
 lot
 more
 when
 you're
 50
 than


you
 can
 when
 you're
 60.
 Even
 if
 you
 are


serious
 about
 keeping
 yourself
 in
 good


shape
 and
 you
 pay
 attention.
 Well,


>> you're
 in
 good
 shape.
 How
 old
 are
 you?


>> I'm
 62.


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 you
 you
 come
 across
 as
 very


young
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 uh


>> I
 was
 even
 better
 when
 I
 was
 50.


Nikolai.


>> It's
 kind
 of
 funny
 because
 um
 a
 lot
 of


the
 people
 we
 interview
 they
 they
 say


they're
 better
 leaders
 uh
 you
 know
 with


age.
 So
 you
 have
 to
 start
 to
 think
 uh
 or


wonder
 you
 know
 how
 many
 bad
 leaders


there
 are
 when
 they're
 you
 know
 all


these
 young
 people.


>> Yeah.
 I
 think


>> everybody
 claims
 they
 get
 better.
 It's


situational
 and
 I
 I
 think
 there's
 a


balance
 because
 I
 also
 believe
 when
 you


come
 into
 a
 job
 like
 this,
 the
 day
 you


enter
 it,
 you
 begin
 distancing
 yourself


from
 the
 reality
 of
 the
 business
 because


of
 the
 demands
 of
 it,


>> the
 time
 you
 have
 to
 spend
 outside
 the


company,
 what
 you
 have
 to
 do
 with
 other


stakeholders.


>> So,
 you're
 never
 going
 to
 be
 as
 good
 as


the
 day
 you
 walked
 into
 it
 in
 terms
 of


your
 intimacy
 with
 the
 company.
 And
 it's


I'm
 not
 really
 a
 big
 believer
 in
 the


Imperial
 CEO
 model
 for
 that
 reason


because
 I
 think
 uh
 getting
 somebody


who's
 more
 uh
 closely
 aligned
 to
 what's


going
 on
 in
 the
 business
 um
 has
 its


merits.
 And
 I
 also
 think
 companies
 are


living
 breathing
 organisms.
 If
 there's


one
 person
 at
 the
 top
 for
 a
 long
 period


of
 time,
 people
 develop
 their
 big


muscles
 to
 respond
 to
 that
 one
 person


and
 they
 let
 all
 the
 smaller
 muscles


around
 them
 kind
 of
 atrophy.
 And


sometimes
 that
 change
 is
 what
 drives
 you


to
 balance
 out
 the
 development
 of
 all


your
 muscles
 and
 all
 your
 skills.
 And


that's
 a
 healthy
 thing
 for
 a
 large


organization.


>> Do
 you
 trust
 your
 gut
 feel
 or
 are
 you


very
 data
 driven?


>> It's
 both.
 I'm
 I
 use
 uh
 I
 have
 some
 guts


that
 I
 usually
 use
 for
 hypotheses.


Typically
 I
 try
 to
 validate
 those


hypotheses
 by
 bringing
 data


>> to
 um
 determine
 whether
 or
 not
 I
 was


right
 about
 them.
 You
 know,
 is
 the


intuition
 correct?
 And
 it's
 a
 it's
 kind


of
 a
 catchall
 process
 with
 it.
 But
 I


think
 part
 of
 being
 a
 good
 leader
 is


being
 able
 to
 evaluate
 what's
 going
 on


around
 you
 and
 see
 unrelated
 but


associated
 signals


>> and
 then
 test
 those
 hypotheses,
 go
 out,


check
 them,
 bring
 data
 to
 them,
 and
 then


act
 upon
 them.
 And
 that's
 clearly
 an


element
 of
 kind
 of
 my
 my
 style.
 I
 would


say
 I
 try
 to
 be
 a
 little
 bit
 provocative


at
 times.


>> I
 heard
 this
 thing
 this
 morning
 in
 God


we
 trust
 and
 the
 rest
 of
 you
 need
 to


bring
 some
 data.


>> Yeah,
 100%.
 And
 it's
 trust
 and
 verify
 is


another
 way
 to
 to
 look
 at
 it.
 And
 I
 I


get
 asked
 this
 a
 lot.
 Do
 you
 trust
 us?


And
 of
 course
 I
 trust
 you.
 But
 part
 of


my
 job
 is
 to
 verify
 that
 there
 isn't
 a


better
 way
 to
 do
 something
 or
 that
 that


we're,
 you
 know,
 actually
 representing


data
 in
 a
 clinical
 fashion
 that
 we
 know


exactly
 what's
 going
 on
 in
 our


operation.


>> Do
 you
 enjoy
 pressure?


>> Um
 I
 don't
 necessarily
 thrive
 on
 it.
 I


don't
 go
 out
 and
 say,
 "Gee,
 I
 would
 I


hope
 my
 day
 is
 really
 stressful
 today


and
 it's
 all
 going
 to
 come."
 But
 I
 I


think
 I
 understand
 it's
 an
 element
 and


part
 of
 my
 job
 in
 any
 given
 day.
 Um
 I
 do


believe
 that
 if
 it's
 applied
 in
 the


right
 fashion,
 it
 can
 be
 a
 motivating


force
 for
 teams
 and
 for
 organizations.


And
 so
 sometimes
 creating
 constructive


pressure
 uh
 is
 a
 necessary
 tool
 to
 get


an
 organization
 to
 move.


>> How
 do
 you
 relax?


>> I
 uh
 I
 have
 three
 grandchildren
 that
 are


very


>> Did
 you
 laugh
 because
 you
 don't
 relax
 so


much
 or
 uh


>> I
 some
 people
 probably
 debate.
 I
 have
 I


have
 three
 grandchildren
 that
 are


fantastic.
 I'm
 in
 a
 different
 place
 when


I
 watch
 them
 because
 you
 get
 the


opportunity
 to
 see
 life
 through
 the
 most


simplest
 of
 eyes.
 It
 doesn't
 take
 a
 lot


to
 entertain
 them
 and
 keep
 them
 engaged.


Uh
 I
 love
 to
 play
 golf.
 I'm
 not
 very


good
 at
 it,
 but
 I
 love
 to
 play
 golf.
 And


time
 on
 the
 golf
 course,
 especially
 when


I'm
 playing
 with
 some
 of
 my
 family


members,
 is
 is
 a
 big
 decompression
 time.


I
 love
 to
 go
 to
 the
 mountains
 and
 be


outdoors,
 whether
 I'm
 boating
 or
 hiking


or
 skiing.
 That's
 a
 big
 release
 for
 me.


>> Why
 do
 you
 think
 why
 do
 you
 think
 nature


is
 soothing
 and
 relaxing?


>> Um
 because
 we're
 we're
 not
 my
 life
 I'm


not
 in
 nature
 day
 in
 and
 day
 out.
 I'm


you
 know
 I'm
 in
 buildings
 and
 I'm
 in


meetings
 and
 I'm
 in
 metropolitan
 areas


and
 I'm
 flying
 in
 and
 out
 of
 airports


and
 when
 you
 get
 into
 an
 environment


where
 you're
 smelling
 pine
 trees
 and


you're
 looking
 at
 water
 and
 it's
 not


developed
 around
 you,
 I
 think
 it
 just


resets
 um
 kind
 of
 the
 environment
 you're


in.
 It's
 it
 stimulates
 the
 body


differently.
 M


>> what
 do
 you
 read?


>> Uh
 there's
 a
 stack
 of
 books
 on
 the
 side


of
 my
 bed
 that's
 about
 that
 high
 and


they
 come
 in
 I
 think
 three
 come
 into
 the


office
 a
 week
 and
 part
 of
 the
 art
 is
 to


figure
 out
 of
 the
 three
 that
 come
 in


which
 one
 is
 the
 one
 that
 you
 should


really
 hang
 on
 to
 and
 read.
 So
 um
 I'm


very
 careful
 about
 what
 comes
 in.
 I
 I've


probably
 oriented
 a
 little
 less
 to


business
 books
 unless
 it's
 an
 emerging


area
 of
 technology
 that's
 helpful
 to
 me.


Um,
 and
 I
 take
 recommendations
 from


people
 on
 life
 stories,
 either
 inspiring


leaders
 or
 autobiographies
 or
 kind
 of
 uh


retrospectives
 on
 somebody's
 great


accomplishments
 that
 I
 take
 a
 lot
 of


satisfaction
 in.
 And
 then


>> which
 historic
 figure
 do
 you
 admire?


>> Uh,
 I'm
 I'm
 a
 big
 uh
 I
 like
 Abraham


Lincoln.
 I
 think
 it
 he
 was
 in
 a


>> you
 have
 to
 say
 that
 as
 an
 American.
 No,


>> you
 don't
 have
 to.
 But
 I
 think
 you
 what


I
 like
 about
 it
 as
 a
 CEO
 is
 he
 was
 in
 a


very
 lonely
 period
 of
 time
 for
 him
 to


make
 some
 really
 hard
 decisions


>> that
 I
 don't
 know
 that
 he
 could


necessarily
 go
 and
 be
 confident
 that


those
 decisions
 were
 going
 to
 be
 have
 a


certain
 outcome
 that
 could
 have
 been


incredibly
 cataclysmic
 depending
 on


which
 way
 they
 went.
 uh
 and
 reading


about
 how
 he
 went
 through
 that
 and
 and


the
 process
 he
 went
 through
 I
 find


interesting
 and
 reassuring.


>> He
 hired
 some
 of
 his
 competitors,
 right?


>> Yes,
 he
 did.


>> Are
 you
 doing
 that?


>> We
 we
 try
 to
 find
 people
 from
 all
 parts


of
 the
 industry
 to
 come
 in
 and
 we're


doing
 a
 lot
 more
 of
 that
 as
 a
 company.


Yes.
 Than
 what
 we
 were
 doing
 10
 years


ago.


>> What
 kind
 of
 music
 do
 you
 play?


>> I
 listen
 to
 everything.
 I
 I
 now
 I
 never


listen
 to
 country
 music
 before
 I
 moved


to
 Texas
 and
 my
 kids
 are
 big
 country


music
 afficionados.
 So,


>> and
 and
 is
 Dallas
 a
 good
 uh
 country


music
 place?


>> It's
 good
 country
 music
 place.
 And
 I


listen
 I
 still
 listen


>> up
 there
 with
 Austin
 and


>> Uhhuh.
 I
 still
 listen
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 album


oriented
 rock
 from
 my
 youth.
 I
 listen
 to


pop
 music
 today.
 I
 when
 I
 need
 to
 calm


down
 a
 little
 bit,
 I'll
 play
 the
 I'll


turn
 the
 piano
 on
 in
 the
 house
 and


listen
 to
 classical
 music
 on
 our
 player


piano,
 which
 when
 I
 retire,
 I
 hope
 to
 be


able
 to
 play
 myself,
 but
 right
 now
 I


have
 to
 let
 it
 play
 for
 me.
 Um,
 so
 I


I'll
 listen
 to
 darn
 near
 anything.


>> Sounds
 good.
 John,
 last
 question.
 What


What
 is
 your
 advice
 to
 young
 people?


>> Especially
 now,
 my
 advice
 to
 young


people
 is
 you
 need
 to
 think
 deliberately


about
 what
 your
 process
 is
 to
 learn.
 Um,


you
 know,
 this
 the
 notion
 that
 we
 can
 go


to
 a
 university
 on
 a
 curriculum
 that's


developed
 over
 five
 or
 six
 years
 and


have
 relevant
 learning
 in
 a
 classroom


environment,
 I
 think,
 is
 fading
 pretty


quickly.
 Um,
 when
 you
 think
 about
 the


resources
 that
 are
 available
 to
 all
 of


us,
 including
 young
 individuals
 that
 are


at
 our
 fingertips
 every
 day
 that
 we
 can


go
 to
 school
 on,
 and
 you
 think
 about
 how


fast
 technolog
 is
 moving,
 how
 fast


business
 models
 are
 moving,
 as
 we've


discussed,


>> you
 have
 to
 think
 about
 your
 career
 in


chapters
 that
 are
 four
 or
 five
 years.


And
 every
 four
 or
 five
 years,
 you're


going to
 have
 to
 build
 a
 a
 new
 gig,
 a


new
 foundation,
 a
 new
 set
 of
 skills,
 a


new
 approach.
 And
 the
 only
 way
 you're


going to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 over
 the


course
 of
 a
 life
 that
 may
 be
 80
 or
 90


years


>> is
 if
 you
 are
 really
 really
 good
 about


being
 the
 dean
 of
 your
 own
 education
 and


having
 a
 process,
 a
 discipline
 under


which
 every
 day
 in
 your
 life
 you
 think


about
 what
 those
 learning
 moments
 are


and
 the
 routines
 that
 you
 use
 to
 learn


and
 carry
 forward
 on
 new
 skills.
 And
 if


you
 develop
 those
 capabilities
 early
 in


your
 life
 and
 your
 career,
 they
 will


serve
 you
 for
 your
 entire
 life
 and


career.


>> We
 have
 an
 unlimited
 amount
 of


information
 available
 to
 us
 today.
 The


winner
 is
 the
 person
 who
 figures
 out
 how


to
 digest
 it.
 And
 AI
 is
 only
 up
 the


stakes
 on
 that
 now
 because
 it's
 allowed


us
 to
 not
 only
 synthesize
 more


information
 quickly,
 but
 it's
 always


available
 to
 us
 to
 learn
 from.
 And


people
 who
 master
 that
 are
 going
 to


probably
 be
 the
 ones
 who
 come
 out
 on
 top


over
 time.


>> Absolutely.
 Well,
 we
 look
 forward
 to


seeing
 you
 mastering
 the
 piano
 in
 your


next
 gig.


>> Yeah.
 You
 won't
 be
 pay
 playing
 paying


any
 ticket
 prices
 to
 come
 see.


>> And
 in
 the
 meantime,
 thanks
 for
 keeping


me
 connected
 while
 in
 New
 York.


>> Yeah.
 Thank
 you,
 Nick.
 It's
 good
 to
 be


with
 you
 today.
