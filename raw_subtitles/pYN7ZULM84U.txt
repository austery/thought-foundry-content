I
 did
 my
 internships
 from
 12,000
 people


to,200
 at
 Slack
 and
 then
 300
 at
 Robin


Hood.
 And
 I
 found
 that
 every
 time
 I
 went


down
 roughly
 an
 order
 of
 magnitude,
 I


felt
 way
 more
 ownership.
 Obviously,
 the


next
 step
 is
 starting
 a
 two
 person


company
 and
 then
 starting
 my
 own.
 The


stack
 at
 warp
 actually
 first
 started
 out


with
 Typescript.
 And
 then
 2
 to
 3
 months


in,
 we
 decided
 to
 scrap
 that
 repository


and
 just
 rebuild
 everything
 in
 Rust.


>> I
 have
 to
 ask
 why.


>> It
 was
 for
 performance
 reasons
 and
 it


was
 also
 speed
 of
 development.
 There
 was


also
 a
 very
 strong
 sentiment
 amongst


developers
 that
 they
 would
 only
 use
 high


performance
 terminals
 that
 were
 built
 at


low
 levels.


>> How
 do
 you
 think
 a
 product
 engineer


versus
 a
 founding
 engineer
 differs?


>> I
 think
 founding
 engineer
 counts
 if


>> what
 does
 it
 take
 to
 [music]
 be
 a


standout
 founding
 engineer?
 Michelle
 Lim


was
 the
 founding
 software
 engineer
 at
 AI


startup
 warp
 [music]
 and
 is
 now
 the


founder
 at
 her
 own
 startup
 Flint
 where


she
 is
 now
 also
 hiring
 founding


engineers.
 In
 this
 conversation,
 we


[music]
 cover
 Michelle's
 thinking


process
 to
 take
 a
 risk
 and
 join
 as


engineer
 number
 one
 at
 a
 littleknown


startup
 when
 she
 had
 better
 paying
 and


[music]
 safer
 options.
 Thriving
 as
 a


founding
 engineer
 and
 why
 only
 to
 pick


up
 work
 that
 no
 one
 else
 wants
 [music]


to
 do.
 Figuring
 out
 if
 you're
 more
 of
 a


product
 first
 or
 code
 first
 engineer
 so


you
 find
 [music]
 your
 place
 better.
 How


Michelle's
 current
 startup
 builds


autonomous
 websites
 and
 uses
 AI
 coding


day-to-day
 and
 many
 more.
 If
 you're


currently
 working
 at
 an
 early
 stage


startup
 or
 want
 to
 work
 one
 day
 at
 a


place
 like
 this
 and
 want
 to
 know
 the


tactics
 on
 how
 to
 do
 well
 in
 these


environments,
 this
 episode
 is
 for
 you.


This
 podcast

 So,
 Michelle,
 welcome
 to
 the


podcast.


>> Thanks,
 G.
 I'm
 so
 glad
 to
 be
 here.


>> It's
 awesome
 to
 have
 you.
 How
 did
 you


get
 into
 software
 engineering?
 So
 I


actually
 started
 in
 college.
 Um
 I
 first


joined
 an
 entrepreneurship
 club
 and
 I


was
 working
 on
 a
 bio
 company
 but
 every


week
 I
 saw
 that
 the
 companies
 in
 my
 club


that
 were
 making
 the
 most
 progress
 were


people
 who
 had
 programmers
 on
 their


team.
 So
 I
 felt
 like
 oh
 like
 if
 I
 wanted


to
 move
 faster
 in
 entrepreneurship


I
 wanted
 to
 actually
 build
 the
 thing


myself
 so
 we
 can
 move
 a
 lot
 faster.
 So,


I
 took
 my
 first
 computer
 science
 class


ever
 in
 the
 spring
 of
 my
 freshman
 year,


which
 is
 very
 late
 compared
 to
 I
 think


most
 of
 your
 listeners.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 it's
 never
 too
 late,
 is
 it?


>> Never
 too
 late.


>> And
 then
 from
 there
 on,
 did
 you
 move


over
 to
 computer
 science?
 Did
 you
 start


studying
 at
 a
 university
 or
 did
 you
 do


it
 on
 the
 side?


>> Yeah.
 So,
 at
 that
 moment,
 I
 actually


then
 started
 majoring
 in
 computer


science.
 Um,
 I
 really
 fell
 in
 love
 with


computer
 science,
 especially
 the


debugging
 was
 my
 favorite
 part,
 which
 is


really
 funny
 for
 most
 people,
 I
 think.


So,
 the
 backstory
 was
 that
 I
 almost


became
 a
 medical
 doctor.
 Like,
 I
 grew
 up


in
 Singapore.
 Yeah.
 Where
 that
 was
 the


uh
 the
 thing
 to
 do
 if
 you're
 good
 at
 the


sciences.
 And
 I
 really
 fell
 in
 love
 with


medicine
 because
 I
 really
 liked


diagnosis,
 like
 differential
 diagnosis.


you
 know,
 someone
 comes
 in
 with,
 you


know,
 a
 swollen
 left
 leg,
 you're
 like,


"Oh,
 that
 could
 be
 a
 problem
 with
 your


right
 lung."
 And
 I
 thought
 that
 that
 was


so
 cool.
 Or
 based
 on
 the
 vision
 that


you're
 seeing
 of
 your
 eyes,
 it
 could
 be


a
 very
 specific
 part
 of
 your
 brain
 that


was
 malfunctioning.
 So,
 I
 really
 liked


the
 debugging
 part
 of
 my
 computer


science
 assignments
 where
 I
 started


seeing
 that
 there
 was
 always
 a
 pattern


in
 which
 the
 bugs
 occurred
 and
 then
 I


could
 trace
 it
 back
 to
 the
 specific


lines
 of
 code
 or
 systems
 that
 led
 to
 it.


So
 I
 felt
 like
 almost
 like
 I
 was
 a


doctor
 for
 the
 computer
 and
 I
 it
 also


helped
 me
 a
 lot
 in
 terms
 of
 being
 able


to
 build
 things
 which
 I
 really
 love.
 I


started
 uh
 interning
 at
 um
 tech


companies
 and
 really
 fell
 in
 love
 with


the
 with
 the
 art
 of
 software
 engineering


um
 and
 that
 that
 just
 further
 um


validated
 that
 I
 really
 love
 software


engineering.


>> And
 then
 you
 entered
 at
 some
 really
 cool


companies.
 I
 think
 it
 was
 Meta,
 Slack,


Robin
 Hood.
 How
 easy
 or
 hard
 was
 it
 to


get
 into
 get
 your
 first
 internship?


Obviously,
 the
 first
 one
 is
 always
 going


to
 be
 the
 hardest.
 And
 then
 what
 did
 you


learn
 at
 these
 places?


>> I
 was
 very
 lucky
 to
 um
 have
 had
 this


university
 program
 where
 they
 actually


placed
 students
 in
 tech
 companies.
 Um


and
 my
 very
 very
 first
 internship


actually
 was
 in
 Sa
 Paulo,
 Brazil.
 Um


where
 I
 was
 working
 as
 an
 intern
 for
 a


healthcare
 company.
 And
 that
 was
 where
 I


really
 got
 my
 start
 and
 really
 learned


uh
 software
 engineering
 from
 a
 very


senior
 developer
 there
 in
 Brazil.
 Um
 so


I'm
 very
 thankful
 for
 uh
 for
 that.
 And


for
 um
 guess
 the
 listeners
 who
 have


university
 programs
 who
 are
 in
 student


school
 um
 reach
 out
 to
 the
 careers


office.
 They
 could
 be
 really
 helpful
 in


helping
 you
 get
 your
 start
 for
 Facebook.


It
 was
 uh
 also
 it
 was
 me
 co-applying
 to


uh
 the
 website
 uh
 to
 this
 program
 called


the
 Facebook
 University.
 So
 this
 is
 for


folks
 who
 are
 underrepresented
 um
 and


who
 are
 new
 to
 computer
 science
 and
 they


bring
 you
 into
 the
 program
 and
 then


bring
 you
 through
 a
 a
 two-eek
 boot
 camp


where
 you're
 building
 an
 app
 every


single
 day.
 So
 there
 every
 single
 day.
 I


was


>> this
 is
 pre
 prei,
 right?


>> This
 is
 prei.
 So
 I
 was
 using
 my
 hands
 to


uh
 write
 Android
 apps
 in
 Java
 and
 so


every
 day
 we
 were
 building
 apps
 and
 then


after
 the
 twoe
 boot
 camp
 we
 were
 put


into
 pods
 where
 we
 had
 to
 build
 a
 fully


functioning
 app
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the


internship
 and
 that's
 when
 I
 learned
 git


for
 the
 first
 time.
 I
 learned
 how
 to


collaborate
 with
 my
 friends.
 Um
 I


learned
 how
 to
 read
 uh
 really
 large
 code


bases
 um
 because
 we
 were
 uh
 building
 a


receipt
 splitting
 app.
 um
 through
 OCR
 as


well
 as
 like
 Bluetooth
 where
 you
 could


find
 your
 friends
 near
 you
 and
 then
 drag


and
 drop
 avatars
 into
 uh
 the
 receipt


items.
 So
 if
 there
 are
 three
 broccololis


and
 you
 ate
 two
 broccololis
 and
 I
 ate


one
 broccoli,
 I
 would
 drag
 avatar
 twice


into
 the
 receipt
 item
 and
 mine
 once
 and


then
 it
 would
 split
 accordingly.
 It
 was


really
 fun,
 really
 cool
 because
 this
 was


a
 personal
 problem
 of
 mine,
 splitting


receipts,
 but
 we
 ended
 up
 having
 to
 dig


really
 deep
 into
 uh
 the
 uh
 open
 source


libraries
 of
 uh
 the
 OCR
 from
 Google
 as


well
 as
 like
 a
 Bluetooth
 protocol
 um


that
 was
 online.
 So,
 I
 became
 really


good
 at
 that.
 And
 I
 was
 also
 very


fortunate
 that
 like
 our
 team
 actually


won
 for
 being
 one
 of
 the
 best
 apps
 in


the
 internship
 program.


>> Awesome.


>> And
 got
 to
 meet
 Mark
 Zuckerberg
 uh
 in


his
 office.


>> Wow.
 So
 after
 a
 Facebook
 internship,
 you


ended
 up
 working
 a
 little bit
 at
 Slack


and
 at
 Robin
 Hood
 as
 well,
 right?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 Um
 and
 that
 was


where
 I
 really
 caught
 the
 uh
 startup


bugs.
 So
 um
 I
 joined
 Slack
 through
 the


uh
 Kleiner
 Perkins
 fellowship
 program.


So
 um
 this
 is
 like
 a
 fellowship
 program


for
 uh
 for
 students
 to
 intern
 over
 the


summer
 with
 the
 portfolio
 companies
 of


this
 VC
 called
 Kleiner
 Perkins.
 Um,
 and


at
 the
 time
 no
 one
 I
 knew
 was
 really


using
 Slack.
 It
 was
 only
 1,200
 people
 uh


at
 the
 time.
 And
 um
 I
 was
 really
 excited


about
 the
 chance
 to
 uh
 see
 what
 this


whole
 like
 startup
 scene
 was
 like.
 I


mean
 at
 the
 time
 I
 considered
 Slack
 a


startup.
 Like
 looking
 back
 it's
 not
 a


startup
 but
 it
 felt
 like
 a
 startup
 to


me.
 Like
 someone
 who
 at
 the
 time
 wasn't


really
 familiar
 with
 tech
 companies
 and


I
 had
 such
 a
 good
 time
 uh
 at
 Slack.
 And


I
 I
 think
 we
 can
 also
 be
 fair
 like
 sure


Slack
 today
 is
 maybe
 not
 a
 startup
 but


like
 compared
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 companies
 they


still
 act
 way
 more
 than
 a
 startup
 even


today.


>> Oh
 yeah
 it
 was
 it
 was
 really
 awesome.


Everyone
 had
 so
 much
 product
 ownership.


It
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 because
 it
 was
 also


incredible
 to
 be
 at
 a
 company
 where
 you


were
 using
 the
 product
 that
 you
 were


building
 every
 single
 day.


>> Yeah.
 like
 it
 was
 like
 I
 would
 start


using
 a
 feature
 um
 then
 I
 would
 be
 like


oh
 like
 I
 think
 that
 instead
 of
 me


having
 to
 search
 through
 my
 emojis
 every


time
 I
 need
 to
 react
 what
 if
 we
 put
 like


a
 frequently
 used
 emoji
 like
 you
 know
 I


I
 I'll
 design
 it
 myself
 post
 it
 in
 this


like
 feature
 request
 channel
 and
 Steuart


Butterfield
 at
 the
 time
 responded
 being


like
 yes
 we
 should
 do
 this
 and
 then
 I


had
 another
 idea
 around
 like
 scheduling


messages
 so
 that
 um
 I
 didn't
 have
 to


wait
 till
 the
 time
 I
 wanted
 to
 send


message
 to
 send
 it
 out
 and
 I
 posted
 it


to
 the
 channel
 as
 well
 and
 he
 said,
 "Ah,


that's
 so
 unnatural.
 We'll
 never
 do


that."
 [laughter]


>> But
 that's
 really
 cool
 getting
 feedback


straight
 from
 the
 CEO
 or
 co-founder.


That's
 awesome.


>> That
 was
 like
 such
 an
 awesome
 uh
 culture


to
 be
 in
 where
 the
 CEO
 was
 so
 excited


about
 the
 product.


>> I
 I
 feel
 the
 culture
 talks
 a
 lot,
 you


know,
 both
 at
 Meta
 and
 and
 at
 Slack.
 The


fact
 that
 the
 CEO
 and
 co-founder
 is
 very


is
 open
 to
 talking.
 Okay,
 they're
 not


going
 to
 spend
 whole
 day,
 you
 know,


talking
 with
 like
 interns
 or
 or
 new


joiners,
 but
 they
 do
 and
 they're


accessible.
 I
 feel
 that's
 going
 to
 make


a
 big
 difference
 between,
 you
 know,
 like


some
 companies
 and
 then
 other
 companies


where
 this
 is
 impossible.


>> Absolutely.
 Yeah.
 Um
 especially
 now
 as
 a


as
 a
 founder
 myself,
 like
 I
 always
 make


sure
 to
 spend
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 and
 be


generous
 in
 my
 time
 with
 with
 people
 on


my
 team.


>> And
 then
 what
 did
 you
 learn
 at
 Robin


Hood?


>> So
 Robin
 Hood
 I
 found
 uh
 through
 uh


through
 a
 tech
 fair.
 Um,
 Robin
 Hood
 was


where
 I
 really
 found
 my
 sweet
 spot
 about


what
 I
 loved
 uh
 to
 do
 in
 software


engineering.
 I
 was
 working
 on
 the
 Robin


Hood
 news
 tab.
 So,
 um,
 this
 is
 a
 tab


that
 let
 you
 see
 let
 users
 see
 the
 the


news
 for
 the
 day
 and
 how
 that
 would,
 you


know,
 affect
 their
 their
 their
 stocks.


And
 at
 the
 time,
 Robin
 Hood
 only
 had


three
 tabs.
 The
 first
 tab
 was
 the
 main


tab,
 you
 know,
 trade


>> portfolio
 trade.
 Yeah.


>> And
 then
 the
 third
 tab
 was
 like


settings,
 so
 notification,
 and
 I
 was


working
 on
 the
 second
 tab,
 and
 I
 had
 it


was
 maybe
 like
 five
 or
 six
 of
 us
 working


on
 that
 main
 tab.
 Um,
 and
 I
 was
 in


charge
 of
 deciding
 um
 what
 news
 to
 show


on
 every
 person's
 feed.


>> Yeah.
 And
 this
 is
 like
 millions
 of


people
 using
 it,
 right?
 And
 making


decisions
 based
 on
 that.
 like
 this
 is


like
 not
 some
 like
 hidden
 feature.


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 was
 19
 or
 20
 uh
 very
 young


and
 they
 gave
 me
 that
 opportunity
 to


build
 that
 and
 I
 really
 found
 that
 I


love
 I
 love
 that
 I
 found
 my
 sweet
 spot


in
 that
 I
 felt
 like
 I
 got
 to
 work
 on


very
 cool
 computer
 science
 concepts
 like


we
 were
 using
 Robin
 Hood
 version
 of


Cafka
 to
 do
 the
 data
 pipelines
 when
 we


received


>> for
 messaging.


>> Yeah.
 for
 the
 messaging
 because
 we
 had


to
 parse
 um
 the
 uh
 video
 feeds
 and
 the


news
 feeds
 coming
 from
 a
 lot
 of
 our


partners
 like
 like
 Bloomberg
 was
 selling


the
 news
 to
 us
 and
 then
 we
 had
 to
 then


tag
 them
 um
 and
 and
 then
 based
 on
 the


tags
 and
 as
 well
 as
 like
 what
 the
 users


uh
 were
 invested
 in
 figure
 out
 like
 what


are
 the
 relevant
 news
 what
 to
 do
 if
 it's


too
 sparse
 how
 do
 you
 um
 populate
 the


feed
 such
 as
 there
 no
 bias
 for
 machine


learning
 cuz
 we
 also
 wanted
 to
 keep


learning
 what
 to
 rank
 first.
 And
 if
 you


had
 a
 very
 prescriptive
 way
 of
 uh


ranking
 your
 feed,
 then
 you
 would
 just


be
 giving
 biased
 data
 to
 the
 machine


learning
 algorithm
 for
 deciding
 what
 is


the
 most
 interesting
 uh
 item.
 So
 like
 to


me
 like
 that
 was
 really
 exciting
 because


one
 I
 was
 learning
 a
 really
 cool


computer
 science
 concept
 but
 then
 two
 I


was
 also
 deciding
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 the


product
 requirements
 you
 know
 what
 does


the
 user
 want
 but
 then
 what
 is


technically
 feasible
 based
 on
 what
 are


the
 business
 partners
 we
 had
 and
 like


based
 on
 our
 tech
 stack
 and
 then
 based


on
 like
 latency
 requirements.
 So
 I
 felt


like
 I
 was
 able
 to
 activate
 like
 like


all
 parts
 of
 my
 brain
 thinking
 about
 the


technical
 side
 but
 also
 the
 product
 side


and
 because
 of
 that
 I
 felt
 like
 oh
 I
 I


really
 love
 software
 engineering
 like


this
 this
 is
 where
 I
 want
 to
 be.


>> Do
 you
 love
 software
 engineering


startups
 or
 both?


>> Um
 it
 was
 actually
 both
 Facebook's
 Slack


and
 then
 Robin
 Hood.
 Um
 they
 actually


became
 smaller
 and
 smaller
 right
 as
 I


did
 my
 internships.


>> Yeah.
 from
 uh
 12,000
 people
 to,200
 at


Slack
 and
 then
 300
 at
 Robin
 Hood.
 And
 I


found
 that
 every
 time
 I
 went
 down,
 like


roughly
 an
 order
 of
 magnitude,
 um
 I
 felt


like
 way
 more
 ownership
 and
 I
 felt
 like


the
 line
 of
 sight
 between
 me
 building


and
 the
 users
 impact
 that
 I
 was
 making


was
 extremely
 clear.
 And
 so
 I
 knew
 like


okay
 now
 that
 I've
 done
 the
 12,000
 the


1200
 and
 then
 300
 obviously
 the
 next


step
 is
 like
 joining
 a
 twoerson
 company


and
 then
 starting
 my
 own.


>> And
 then
 Slack
 did
 did
 you
 work
 after


graduation
 or
 was
 that
 your
 last


internship?


>> Robin
 Hood
 was
 my
 last
 internship
 Robin


Hood
 last


>> Facebook
 Slack
 and
 Robin
 Hood
 were
 my


internships.


>> Okay.
 And
 then
 like
 it's
 well
 you
 had
 a


healthcare
 company
 before


>> and
 the
 healthcare
 company.
 Yes.


>> So
 it's
 incredible.
 You
 had
 four


internships
 in
 I
 guess
 in
 four
 different


summers.
 uh
 three
 summers


>> and
 in in
 three
 summers
 you
 kind
 of
 had


them
 together
 which
 is
 amazing
 and
 now


like
 you
 had
 all
 these
 companies
 behind


your
 back
 on
 your
 resume.
 I'm
 assuming


you
 know
 you
 could
 have
 decided
 to
 go


into
 a
 bunch
 of
 different
 companies
 and


then
 yet
 you
 decided
 to
 go
 into
 this


unknown
 company
 that
 at
 the
 time
 was
 was


completely
 unknown.
 It
 just
 raised


something.
 It
 seems
 like
 a
 pretty
 risky


bet
 to
 go
 into
 a
 early
 stage
 or
 like


seedstage
 startup.
 Tell
 me
 what
 was
 your


thinking
 after
 this?
 again
 you've
 you've


seen
 these
 different
 companies
 and
 how


did
 you
 end
 up
 at
 like
 such
 a
 small


company
 kind
 of
 it
 it
 felt
 like
 taking
 a


big
 risk
 I'll
 be
 honest


>> oh
 yeah
 um
 it
 was
 it
 was
 a
 very
 big
 risk


there
 wasn't
 any
 code
 written
 yet
 at
 the


time


>> there
 was
 no
 code


>> no
 code
 written
 um


>> so
 it
 was
 just
 an
 idea
 and
 like
 a


founder
 with
 an
 idea
 or


>> they
 were
 very
 nice
 mocks
 um
 the
 first


the
 first
 hire
 at
 warp
 was
 actually
 a


designer


>> and
 and
 then
 can
 you
 tell
 me
 like
 what


was
 the
 kind
 of
 idea
 what
 was
 the
 stage


at
 warp
 when
 you
 came
 there
 what
 was
 the


vision
 what
 were
 the
 mocks
 like
 Oh
 yeah.


Well,
 first
 of
 all,
 it
 was
 called
 Denver


at
 the
 time.


>> Denver.


>> Denver.
 And
 um


>> No.
 No
 wonder
 it
 didn't
 stick.


>> I
 remember
 being
 like,
 if
 you
 want
 to


think
 about
 SEO,
 Denver
 terminal
 is


definitely
 not
 the
 way
 to
 go.
 Back
 then,


I
 already
 had
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 growth


intuition.
 Um
 but
 it
 was
 meant
 as
 a
 as
 a


placeholder
 as
 they
 figure
 out
 what
 the


as
 Zach,
 the
 founder,
 was
 thinking
 about


names.
 Um,
 so
 there
 was
 the
 key
 mock
 was


a
 terminal
 that
 had
 the
 terminal
 input


at
 the
 bottom
 anchored
 at
 the
 very


bottom.
 And
 then
 there
 was
 a
 blinking


cursor
 that
 was
 a
 line
 instead
 of
 a


rectangle.


And
 then
 there
 was
 a
 concept
 of
 blocks


where
 terminal
 inputs
 and
 outputs
 were


grouped
 together
 and
 there
 were
 lines


between
 the
 blocks


>> and
 that
 was
 the
 key
 the
 key
 one.
 And


then
 I
 think
 the
 second
 mock
 was


collaboration.
 So
 we
 had
 like
 different


avatars
 on
 each
 of
 the
 terminal
 um


blocks.
 So
 it
 was
 almost
 like
 Google


Docs
 or
 Figma
 like
 oh
 you
 could
 have


multiple
 people
 looking
 at
 this
 mock
 at


at
 this
 terminal.
 That's
 so
 cool.
 And


then
 there
 was
 the
 concept
 of
 like


sharing
 environment
 variables
 and


presets.
 Um
 cuz
 we
 all
 know
 like


everyone
 is
 such
 a
 pain
 to
 get


environment
 variables
 uh
 especially
 in


teams.
 I
 mean,
 no
 one
 wants
 to
 confess


this,
 but
 I'm
 sure
 everyone
 has
 had
 send


has
 has
 experience
 of
 sending


environment
 variables
 through
 Slack.
 Um,


and
 that's
 it's
 no
 good.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 also,
 of
 course,
 I
 mean,


you
 always
 have
 them
 in
 your
 local


files,
 which
 is
 a
 necessity,
 but
 yeah,


as
 you
 said,
 sharing
 them.
 You
 don't


want
 to
 put
 it
 into
 GitHub,
 but
 yeah,


how
 do
 you
 transfer
 them?
 Yeah,
 exactly.


Sharing
 those
 keys
 that
 should
 not
 be


shared
 because
 your
 colleagues
 need
 them


or
 your
 teammates.
 Yeah,
 as
 you
 said.
 So


like
 so
 like
 do
 I
 understand
 the
 vision


was
 like
 basically
 the
 vision
 was
 like


hey
 the
 terminal
 has
 been
 around
 forever


here's
 a
 couple
 of
 cool
 ideas
 on
 how
 we


can
 innovate
 and
 this
 was
 pre
 AAI
 right


like
 this
 prei


>> okay
 we
 but
 already
 that
 that
 was
 the


the
 vision
 now
 can
 you
 tell
 me
 a
 little


bit
 about
 like
 I
 feel
 not
 many
 people


talk
 about
 this
 especially
 when
 you're


still
 earlier
 in
 your
 career
 you're
 a


new
 grad
 okay
 you
 know
 like
 you've
 had
 a


couple
 of
 like
 really
 cool
 internships


which
 means
 probably
 you
 know
 like
 a
 lot


more
 companies
 will
 be
 open
 to
 to
 hiring


you
 were
 you
 interviewing
 at
 other


companies
 as
 well
 or
 was
 this
 the
 first


one
 you
 did?
 And
 how
 did
 you
 think
 about


or
 how
 did
 you
 go
 about
 like
 negotiating


your
 you
 know
 your
 first
 full-time


composition
 cuz
 I
 guess
 with
 internships


you
 don't
 have
 much
 negotiation
 but
 but


here
 you
 probably
 had
 some
 leeway.


>> Oh
 yeah,
 every
 everyone
 wanted
 engineers


at
 the
 time.
 The
 thing
 is
 that
 I
 never


really
 envisioned
 myself
 joining
 such
 a


small
 company.
 It
 was
 only
 two
 people


and


and
 there
 was
 no
 Kin.
 Um,
 so
 my
 focus


during
 my
 uh
 job
 search
 process
 was


focusing
 on
 uh
 15
 to
 20
 people
 teams


series
 A.
 I
 had
 a
 couple
 options
 that


had
 $10
 million
 ARR
 already.
 So,
 you


know,
 you
 you
 could
 I
 could
 join
 a


rocket
 ship
 like
 see
 like
 fast
 growth


and
 then
 get
 to
 know
 for
 sure
 that
 there


will
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 opportunities
 because


when
 you
 have
 a
 fast
 growth
 company,


there's
 just
 way
 more
 things
 to
 do
 than


there
 are
 people.
 Michelle
 was
 just


talking
 about
 how
 she
 had
 the
 option
 of


joining
 startups
 that
 were
 growing


really
 fast
 even
 before
 AI.
 Today,
 what


I'm
 seeing
 is
 many
 startups
 are
 growing


even
 faster
 because
 they
 can
 get
 to


incredible
 velocity
 with
 AI
 coding


tools.
 And
 so,
 they
 can
 ship
 features
 a


lot
 faster
 than
 before.
 But
 without


measurement,
 you
 don't
 know
 which


features
 are
 helping
 and
 which
 are


hurting
 your
 growth.
 When
 you're


shipping
 10x
 faster
 with
 AI,
 that


uncertainty
 compounds.
 You
 could
 be


shipping
 faster
 towards
 better
 metrics


or
 you
 could
 be
 shipping
 more
 features


that
 hurt
 conversion
 and
 retention.
 This


is
 where
 our
 presenting
 partner
 static


comes
 in.
 Static
 built
 experimentation


and
 feature
 management
 that
 acts
 as


guardrails
 for
 AI
 accelerated


development.
 Here's
 how
 it
 works.
 You


ship
 a
 feature
 to
 10%
 of
 users
 in
 a


control
 experiment.
 Static
 automatically


creates
 a
 control
 group
 and
 measures
 the


impact.
 If
 the
 feature
 improves
 metrics,


you
 confidently
 scale
 to
 100%.
 If
 it


would
 hurt
 metrics,
 you
 catch
 it
 early


when
 it's
 only
 affecting
 10%
 of
 users,


not
 your
 entire
 user
 base.
 You're
 making


datadriven
 decisions
 at
 the
 same
 pace


you're
 shipping
 code.
 Companies
 like


Notion
 went
 from
 singledigit
 experiments


per
 quarter
 to
 over
 300
 experiments
 with


static.
 They
 shipped
 over
 600
 features


behind
 feature
 flags,
 catching
 the
 ones


that
 would
 hurt
 metrics
 early
 and


launching
 the
 winners.
 This
 is
 the


faster
 testing,
 validation,
 and
 learning


loop
 that
 matters
 when
 you're
 shipping


at
 AI
 velocity.
 Most
 teams
 stitch


together
 separate
 systems,
 wait
 on


queries,
 and
 try
 to
 correlate
 user


segments
 that
 don't
 match.
 By
 the
 time


they
 know
 if
 something
 worked,
 they've


already
 moved
 on
 to
 the
 next
 feature.


With
 Static,
 you
 have
 everything
 in
 one


place.
 Feature
 flags,
 experimentation,


and
 analytics
 with
 the
 same
 user
 data.


Static
 has
 a
 generous
 free
 tier
 to
 get


started,
 and
 proing
 for
 teams
 starts
 at


$150
 per
 month.
 To
 learn
 more
 and
 get
 a


30-day
 enterprise
 trial,

stats.com/pragmatic.


And
 now
 let's
 get
 back
 to
 why
 Tim


Michelle
 chose
 to
 join
 a
 very
 early


stage
 startup.


>> So
 I
 actually
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 those


options.
 Um
 but
 ever
 since
 talking
 to


Zach
 um
 the
 the
 founder
 of
 Warp,
 I
 kept


thinking
 every
 day
 about
 the
 product
 and


how
 we
 could
 make
 it
 better.
 Mhm.


>> And
 it
 was
 just
 a
 product
 that
 I
 had
 to


I
 discovered
 that
 I
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 passion


for
 because
 um
 when
 I
 was
 uh
 doing
 the


software
 engineering
 internships,
 I


actually
 found
 that
 there
 was
 a
 lot
 of


uh
 real
 business
 impact
 from
 improving


the
 terminal.
 In
 the
 summer
 of
 2018,


Slack
 had
 multiple
 outages.
 Um
 that
 was


the
 first
 time
 that
 Slack
 was
 bringing


on
 new
 enterprise
 clients
 like
 IBM
 and


Disney.
 And
 so
 what
 you
 know
 the
 double


nested
 loops
 that
 could
 have
 worked
 for


uh
 selling
 to
 startups
 no
 longer
 worked


at
 IBM
 and
 Disney
 scale.
 And
 so
 a
 lot
 of


things
 were
 breaking.
 A
 lot
 of
 terminal


comm
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 internal
 tools
 were
 run


through
 CLIs.
 A
 lot
 of
 commands
 were


being
 shared
 on
 Slack.


>> Uh
 there
 was
 an
 ops
 rotation.
 And
 so
 I


felt
 like


>> you
 were
 you
 you
 were
 seeing
 the


potential
 of
 like
 how
 just
 like
 I
 know


sharing
 commands
 better
 like
 better


tooling
 a
 collaborative
 C
 cl C CLI
 even


a
 Slack
 could
 have
 been
 helpful
 at
 your


time
 right?


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 saw
 a
 huge
 business
 impact


and
 then
 second
 I
 also
 personally
 as


someone
 who
 just
 learned
 computer


science
 just
 a
 few
 years
 back
 saw
 that


it
 was
 a
 very
 big
 barrier
 to
 entry
 for
 a


lot
 of
 computer
 science
 students
 um


because
 computer
 science
 is
 already
 so


scary
 um
 to
 learn
 for
 someone
 who's
 new


to
 it
 um
 but
 what
 is
 even
 scarier
 is


trying
 to
 move
 the
 cursor
 from
 one
 uh


character
 on
 your
 command
 to
 another
 and


realizing
 that
 the
 mouse
 doesn't
 work


like
 I
 felt
 like
 there
 was
 also
 a
 lot
 of


impact
 society
 that
 can
 be
 made
 if


coding
 was
 a
 lot
 simpler
 for
 everybody.


Um
 if
 we
 could
 make
 a
 terminal
 more


accessible,
 if
 you
 could
 move
 the
 cursor


with
 your
 mouse
 instead
 of
 memorizing


control
 A
 uh
 and
 Emac
 shortcuts.
 Um
 so


it
 was
 like
 okay
 this
 business
 idea


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 business
 u
 impact
 and


potential
 revenue
 and
 if
 we
 do
 well
 we


can
 make
 computer
 science
 a
 lot
 more


accessible
 like
 when
 else
 can
 I
 join


such
 a
 cool
 idea
 as
 the
 first
 engineer.


I
 could
 always
 look
 for
 a
 job
 um
 in
 any


of
 these
 like
 $10
 million
 ARR
 like


doubling
 like
 every
 quarter
 things
 but


it's
 so
 rare
 to
 kind
 of
 coincide
 with


the
 window
 in
 which
 this
 company
 was


being
 started
 and
 that
 I
 get
 the
 chance


to
 be
 the
 first
 engineer.
 Um
 the
 other


thing
 was
 like
 in
 other
 companies
 if
 I


were
 to
 join
 I
 wouldn't
 get
 the


opportunity
 to
 work
 so
 closely
 with


someone
 who
 was
 a
 principal
 engineer
 at


Google.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 Zach
 was
 a
 principal
 Google


engineer,
 right?
 Like
 he's
 a
 longtime


software
 engineer.


>> Yeah.
 Former
 CTO
 at
 Time
 magazine
 and
 I


felt
 like
 I,
 you
 know,
 some
 of
 my


friends
 would
 go
 um
 study
 masters


programs
 to
 be
 better
 at
 computer


science.
 But
 here
 I
 had
 this
 opportunity


to
 get
 go
 through
 Zack
 University
 to


become
 a
 really
 good
 software
 engineer


very
 quickly
 working
 directly
 with
 him.


He
 was
 looking
 through
 all
 my
 tag
 dogs,


all
 my
 pull
 requests,
 and
 I
 just
 became


a
 very
 uh
 good
 engineer
 very
 fast.
 That


was
 how
 I
 made
 the
 decision.
 Uh
 it
 was
 a


it
 was
 definitely
 very
 atypical.
 Uh
 like


I
 I
 could
 have
 gone
 back
 to
 Robin
 Hood.


I
 had
 that
 return
 offer.
 Um
 but
 I
 just


knew
 that
 I
 needed
 to
 be
 somewhere
 a
 lot


smaller.
 Did
 you
 negotiate
 your


compensation?
 Especially,
 you
 know,
 with


startups
 when
 you're
 joining
 early
 on
 in


a
 Silicon
 Valley
 startup
 or
 or
 at
 like


honestly
 most
 startups
 that
 are
 kind
 of


like
 either
 have
 venture
 funding
 or
 plan


venture
 funding,
 a
 part
 of
 composition


is
 equity,
 which
 is
 always
 a
 bit
 tricky


subject
 for
 for
 most
 software
 engineers.


How
 did
 you
 research
 equity?
 How
 did
 you


learn
 about
 it?
 Did
 you
 negotiate
 it
 or


you
 just
 kind
 of
 took
 whatever
 was,
 you


know,
 on
 the
 offer?
 because
 I
 feel
 this


is
 a
 topic
 that
 not
 many
 people
 talk


about
 but
 it
 does
 get
 pretty
 important


right?


>> It
 is
 so
 important
 uh
 to
 to
 negotiate


for
 equity.
 I
 really
 negotiated
 hard
 for


as
 much
 equity
 as
 possible
 and
 what
 I


was
 willing
 to
 trade
 off
 was
 cash.


>> How
 was
 your
 offer
 presented?
 Yeah,
 I


was
 presented
 a
 spreadsheet
 that
 had


three
 options
 uh
 with
 increasing
 salary


and
 decreasing
 equity.
 It
 was
 a
 really


good
 spreadsheet
 and
 I
 I
 actually
 use


this
 today
 uh
 where
 it
 actually


>> at
 your
 startup
 if
 someone
 gets
 an
 offer


they're
 going to
 get
 a
 spreadsheet
 like


this.


>> Yes,
 at
 Flint
 my
 company
 you
 will
 get


this
 spreadsheet
 that
 helps
 you


calculate
 what
 the
 equity
 actually
 means


in
 terms
 of
 the
 compensation
 value.
 Uh


we
 also
 hand
 like
 we
 also
 calculate
 tax


as
 well
 as
 dilution
 at
 every
 stage
 and


then
 we
 also
 have
 this
 uh
 calculator


that
 helps
 you
 calculate
 the
 expected
 uh


value
 of
 your
 stock
 based
 on
 different


uh
 outcomes
 and
 the
 likelihoods
 of
 each


outcome.
 Um
 and
 all
 credit
 is
 to
 Zach


from
 from
 War
 who
 let
 me
 use
 this
 uh


spreadsheet.
 But
 anyway,
 there
 are
 three


there
 are
 three
 options
 and
 um
 I
 argued


very
 hard
 for
 the
 one
 with
 the
 most


equity
 and
 I
 was
 willing
 to
 go
 extremely


low
 on
 cash.
 And
 in
 terms
 of
 what


leverage
 I
 had,
 this
 is
 probably
 a
 bad


negotiation
 strategy,
 but
 the
 way
 that
 I


negotiated
 that
 was
 saying,
 "Hey,
 Zach,


I
 actually
 really
 really
 want
 to
 work


with
 you.
 Um,
 I
 will
 work
 with
 you.
 Um,


I
 will
 sign
 this
 offer.
 this
 is
 I
 really


want
 to
 build
 this
 thing.
 Let's
 go
 do


it.
 I
 would
 really
 appreciate
 if
 we


could
 do
 this
 off
 this
 number
 instead
 of


this
 number.
 Some
 might
 say
 that
 that's


a
 really
 bad
 uh
 negotiation
 strategy


because
 you
 are
 losing
 all
 the
 cards
 by


saying
 that
 you
 don't
 have
 any
 other


options
 and
 uh
 you
 know
 some
 might
 say


the
 best
 way
 to
 increase
 your
 your
 offer


is
 by
 having
 competition.
 But
 I
 think


that
 early
 stage
 companies
 um
 where


you're
 joining
 as
 just
 like
 one
 or
 two


people,
 it
 really
 means
 a
 lot
 to
 the


founder
 that
 you
 are
 bought
 in,
 ready
 to


go,
 excited
 to
 help
 them
 and
 they
 want


you
 to
 be
 happy
 and
 they
 want
 to
 make


sure
 that
 you
 have a
 good
 deal.
 I
 will


say
 like
 you
 know
 the
 the
 general
 advice


of
 negotiation
 that
 you
 read
 online


first
 of
 all
 a
 lot
 of
 it
 is
 written
 when


you're
 negotiating
 with
 against
 faceless


corporations
 where
 the
 person
 uh
 giving


the
 offer
 let's
 say
 an
 injury
 manager
 or


HR
 they
 don't
 own
 this
 thing
 they're


given
 numbers
 and
 it's
 they
 have
 a
 job


to
 do
 which
 is
 close
 people
 and
 they


have
 don't
 have
 too
 much
 emotion
 and
 a


lot
 of
 that
 advice
 will
 work
 you
 know


like
 that
 they
 do
 but
 as
 you
 say
 in
 a


startup
 it's
 it's
 people
 it's
 a
 very


small
 team
 the
 founders
 do
 care
 and
 I


will
 say
 this
 like
 a
 lot
 of
 a
 lot
 of


good
 founders
 will
 actually
 just
 not


make
 offer
 to
 people's
 who
 they
 don't


think
 believe
 in
 what
 they
 do
 because


it's
 so
 early
 so
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 what
 what


you
 did
 like
 of
 course
 you
 know
 like
 it


probably
 goes
 against
 all
 the
 advice
 out


there
 cuz
 the
 advice
 is
 not
 for
 this


like
 I
 feel
 being
 authentic
 like
 being


excited
 I
 cannot
 talk
 for
 all
 founders


but
 I
 know
 some
 founders
 and
 I
 I
 I
 do


think
 this
 means
 and
 honestly
 like
 in
 in


the
 end
 following
 your
 gut
 is
 a
 pretty


good
 strategy.
 A
 lot
 of
 times


>> a
 funny
 thing
 about
 gut
 is
 that
 actually


the
 day
 before
 the
 offer
 I
 was
 uh
 u


making
 the
 decision
 I
 had,
 you
 know,
 the


10
 million
 er
 company
 that
 was
 doubling


and
 I
 had
 warp.
 I'm
 in
 Denver
 at
 the


time
 and
 my
 stomach
 was
 actually
 acting


up
 uh
 the
 the
 night
 before
 because
 I


think
 it
 was
 feeling
 that
 it
 was
 the
 the


dissonance
 between
 like
 what
 I
 was
 going


to
 do
 versus
 what
 I
 really
 wanted
 to
 do.


Now,
 one
 thing
 I've
 heard
 that
 is
 also


atypical
 and
 no
 one
 will
 suggest,
 but


you
 still
 did
 it,
 is
 you
 know
 when
 a


company
 makes
 you
 an
 offer,
 they
 often


ask
 for
 references
 for
 you
 to
 talk
 with


other
 people
 or
 before
 they
 make
 an


offer.
 I
 heard
 you
 did
 that
 with
 Zach


Warp
 CEO.
 H
 how
 did
 that
 happen?


>> Yeah,
 I
 actually
 pulled
 up
 the
 email


before
 this
 and
 I
 saw
 that
 I
 said
 like,


"Hey,
 Zach,
 really
 excited
 about
 this.


Um,
 happy
 to
 send
 you
 my
 ref
 checks."
 Um


I
 would
 also
 like
 to
 learn
 more
 about


how
 you
 are
 as
 a
 manager.
 Can
 you
 send


me
 a
 reference
 uh
 references
 for
 people


that
 you
 have
 managed
 before?
 Um


especially
 when
 they
 were
 junior


engineer.


>> We all
 see


>> I
 mean
 I
 I
 would
 recommend
 everyone
 to


to
 do
 this
 actually.
 They
 say
 like
 you


you
 don't
 leave
 companies,
 you
 leave


managers.
 Um
 and
 uh
 at
 a
 startup
 you


can't
 pick
 your
 manager,
 you
 can't
 leave


a
 team.
 Like
 my


>> this
 there.


>> Yeah.
 Like
 my
 friends
 working
 at
 Google


could
 be
 having
 a
 bad
 time
 with
 one
 team


and
 then
 they
 could
 switch
 to
 another


team.
 At
 a
 startup
 you
 are
 married
 to


that
 manager.
 So
 you
 need
 to
 learn
 as


much
 as
 possible
 about
 what
 it
 would
 be


like
 working
 with
 them.


And
 um
 you
 have
 like
 reference
 checks


are
 by
 the
 way
 the
 most
 important
 part


of
 any
 interview
 process.
 Like
 that
 is


like
 sometimes
 even
 more
 important
 than


the
 on-site
 itself.
 So
 at
 your
 current


startup,
 you're
 also
 doing
 reference


checks.


>> Always,


>> always,


>> always.


>> And
 what
 do
 you
 look
 in
 a
 reference


check
 now?
 Just
 kind
 of,
 you
 know,


thinking
 a
 little
 bit
 from
 a
 founder,


you've
 been
 on
 the
 other
 side
 cuz
 I
 I


feel
 they
 are
 coming
 back,
 but
 I
 I
 don't


hear
 it
 that
 frequently.
 And
 I
 don't


think
 a
 lot
 of
 people
 know
 how
 to
 do
 it.


Well,


>> if
 I
 as
 a
 founder,
 I'm
 evaluating
 a


candidate.
 Um,
 the
 most
 important


question
 I
 ask
 is,


would
 you
 want
 to
 work
 with
 this
 person


again?
 And
 the
 answer
 I'm
 looking
 for
 is


not
 yes.
 The
 answer
 I'm
 looking
 for
 is


hell
 yes.
 I
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 like
 why


you
 even
 asking
 me
 this
 question.
 Like


you're
 so
 lucky
 to
 have
 this
 person
 like


I
 don't
 know
 what's
 happening
 in
 the


waters
 of
 your
 company
 but
 like
 how
 are


you
 able
 to
 pull
 someone
 like
 this?
 That


is
 what
 I'm
 looking
 for.
 Um
 if
 I'm


hearing
 like
 a
 oh
 like
 yeah
 I
 think
 that


they
 could
 be
 great
 or
 like
 yeah
 they're


very
 strong.
 Um
 that
 to
 me
 is
 like
 a
 bad


reference
 check
 that
 does
 not
 pass
 my
 my


test.
 one
 day
 of
 a
 work
 trial
 is
 a
 very


good
 good
 pro
 approximator.
 Um
 but
 it's


just
 not
 the
 same
 as
 like
 working
 long


term
 with
 someone.
 So
 this
 is
 very


important.
 Um
 I
 actually
 think
 that
 like


engineers
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 um
 power
 and


leverage
 um
 because
 the
 good
 ones
 a
 lot


more
 people
 want
 them.
 But
 at
 the
 same


time,
 it's
 very
 hard
 for
 you
 to
 assess


like
 what
 is
 it
 going
 to
 be
 like
 working


at
 this
 AI
 startup.
 Um
 because
 uh
 it


doesn't
 have
 that
 much
 reference
 points


from
 uh
 from
 the
 outside.
 Um
 so
 uh
 it's


very
 important
 to
 assess
 how
 they
 are
 as


a
 manager.
 as
 a
 junior
 a
 more
 junior


person
 entering
 a
 company.
 I
 think
 one


of
 the
 ways
 that
 you
 could
 have
 a
 bad


time
 is
 if
 you
 join
 a
 company
 where
 they


don't
 promote
 and
 mentor
 and
 grow
 uh


younger
 people.
 I've
 seen
 this
 happen
 at


my
 friends
 companies
 where
 they
 would
 be


the
 first
 10
 people
 who
 built
 the


company
 and
 then
 as
 soon
 as
 the
 company


does
 well,
 they're
 replaced
 by


executives
 and
 then
 they're
 never


promoted
 beyond
 the
 entry
 level
 that


they
 were
 in
 even
 though
 they
 built
 the


company
 and
 they
 spent
 a
 lot
 of
 their


time
 and
 effort
 and
 youth
 and
 energy


working
 on
 the
 company.


So
 it
 was
 really
 important
 in
 my


reference
 check
 to
 check
 how
 much


opportunity
 did
 someone
 young
 and
 junior


get
 like
 what
 were
 career
 conversations


like?
 How
 did
 promotions
 work?
 What
 was


it
 like
 during
 the
 tough
 times?
 Um
 and


Zach
 passed
 like
 exceeded
 all
 of
 the


tests
 in
 that
 I
 talked
 to
 two
 engineers


that
 were
 new/in
 interns
 working
 for


Zach
 and
 then
 very
 quickly
 became


director
 of
 engineering
 at
 uh
 Google


Sheets.
 Um,
 so
 he
 was
 clearly
 someone


who
 would
 bet
 on
 young
 talent
 and
 then


help
 to
 promote
 them.
 Um,
 and
 I
 saw
 that


again
 again
 at
 at
 Warp
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 uh


younger
 new
 grads
 were
 given
 positions


of
 tech
 lead
 or
 being
 able
 to
 uh
 run
 the


most
 critical
 uh
 project
 streams
 at
 Warp


because
 Zach
 always
 bets
 on
 the
 young


talent.
 And
 I
 I
 think
 in
 general
 this
 is


probably
 sounds
 like
 a
 great
 strategy
 of


trying
 to
 get
 or
 or
 asking
 for


references
 from
 your
 future
 manager
 and


asking
 them
 about
 what
 you
 care.
 You


know
 this
 might
 be
 in
 your
 case
 it
 was


like
 yeah
 can
 I
 have
 a
 career
 trajectory


if
 you're
 looking
 for
 let's
 say


stability
 may
 maybe
 look
 for
 that
 but
 I


think
 it's
 just
 like
 such
 an
 underrated


thing.
 I
 haven't
 heard
 anyone
 else
 do


this
 so
 congrats
 on
 on
 doing
 and
 sharing


it
 with
 us.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 the
 the
 last
 thing
 I'll
 add


there
 is
 that
 even
 if
 it's
 not
 for


evaluation
 it
 could
 be
 for
 advice.
 like


how
 would
 you
 be
 able
 to
 work
 with
 this


manager
 best?
 Like
 maybe
 it's
 like


insist
 in
 insisting
 on
 the
 weekly


one-on-
 ones,
 maybe
 it's
 about
 like


proactively
 asking
 for
 advice
 in
 this


specific
 way.
 So
 it
 doesn't
 hurt
 you
 to


do
 it.
 Um
 and
 you
 can
 always
 frame
 it
 as


that
 you're
 getting
 advice
 on
 how
 to


work
 closer
 with
 them.


>> I
 love
 how
 Michelle
 shared
 the
 story
 of


how
 Warp
 was
 founded
 and
 how
 she
 joined


as
 a
 founding
 engineer.
 Talking
 about


the
 founding
 of
 a
 startup
 touches
 nicely


on
 the
 origin
 of
 our
 season
 sponsor,


Linear.
 The
 idea
 for
 linear
 came
 about


when
 their
 founders
 were
 going
 through


hyperrowth
 phases
 at
 Airbnb,
 Coinbase,


and
 Uber.
 As
 you'd
 expect
 with
 real


scale,
 these
 companies
 started
 to
 slow


down.
 What
 used
 to
 take
 days
 started


taking
 weeks,
 sometimes
 even
 months.
 Not


because
 people
 work
 less
 harder,
 but


because
 there
 were
 a
 lot
 more
 moving


parts
 that
 needed
 to
 be
 coordinated.
 As


an
 example,
 in
 the
 early
 days
 of
 Uber,


it
 took
 a
 single
 engineer
 about
 5
 days


to
 integrate,
 test,
 and
 ship
 a
 new


payment
 method
 to
 the
 app
 Google
 Wallet.


But
 years
 later,
 it
 took
 around
 2
 months


for
 three
 engineers
 on
 my
 team
 to
 build


and
 release
 Google
 Pay
 because
 there
 was


so
 much
 more
 planning
 coordination
 with


stakeholders
 working
 with
 other


stakeholder
 teams
 and
 the
 vendor


themselves.
 As
 teams
 grow
 in
 size,


product
 development
 gets
 hit


particularly
 hard.
 Every
 team
 involved


in
 the
 process
 using
 a
 different
 set
 of


tools
 and
 workflows.
 This
 fragmentation


means
 there's
 no
 scalable
 way
 to
 answer


what
 has
 been
 committed,
 what's
 at
 risk,


who's
 actually
 accountable,
 who
 are
 we


building
 this
 feature
 for.
 It's
 often
 a


total
 mess.
 The
 conventional
 approach
 is


to
 compensate
 for
 tooling
 gaps
 with
 more


headcount
 or
 with
 more
 status
 meetings,


but
 in
 my
 experience,
 it
 doesn't
 help


much.
 This
 is
 why
 Linear
 exists
 to
 give


high
 growth
 teams
 the
 clarity
 and


coordination
 they
 need
 without
 the


overhead.
 Linear's
 founders
 build
 a
 tool


they
 wish
 they
 had
 during
 those
 chaotic


hyperode
 scaling
 phases.
 You
 can
 try
 it


yourself
 at
 linear.app/pragmatic


and
 see
 why
 teams
 like
 Gramp
 and
 Clay


also
 switched
 over.
 And
 now,
 let's
 get


back
 to
 Michelle
 and
 her
 time
 as
 a


founding
 engineer
 at
 war.
 when
 you


joined
 warp
 uh
 what
 kind
 of
 technologies


did
 you
 work
 on
 and
 how
 did
 you
 find


your
 so-called
 kind
 of
 stack
 or
 place


because
 you
 later
 talked
 about
 how
 you


know
 in
 startups
 or
 in
 tech
 companies


there's
 kind
 of
 like
 more
 product
 and


more
 infrastructure
 more
 front
 end
 more


more
 backend
 where
 did
 you
 end
 up
 in


this
 sense


>> so
 the
 stack
 at
 warp
 actually
 first


started
 out
 with
 JavaScript
 and
 then


within


>> not
 even
 TypeScript


>> oh
 it
 was
 TypeScript


>> TypeScript
 okay


>> and
 then
 uh
 two
 to
 three
 months
 in
 we


decided
 to
 scrap
 that
 repository
 and


rewrite
 every
 just
 like
 rebuild


everything
 in
 rust.


>> I
 have
 to
 ask
 why
 although
 I
 I
 suspect


why.


>> Yeah.
 So
 it
 was
 for
 performance
 reasons


and
 it
 was
 also
 speed
 of
 development.


>> Yeah.


>> So
 um
 while
 it
 was
 really
 fast
 to
 push


out
 JavaScript
 code,
 we
 then
 needed
 to


spend
 a
 lot
 of
 cycles
 testing
 stress


testing
 it
 against
 um
 a
 lot
 of


performance
 constraints.
 So,
 one
 thing
 I


did
 with
 our
 JavaScript
 app
 was
 that
 I


drew
 a thousand
 rectangles
 um
 and
 then
 I


started
 scrolling
 the
 terminal
 and
 the


scrolling
 was
 breaking.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 it's
 extremely
 important
 for
 us


to
 be
 able
 to
 draw
 a
 lot
 of
 rectangles


because
 yeah
 like
 terminals
 output
 a
 lot


of
 a
 lot
 of
 uh
 logs
 and
 everything
 needs


to
 to
 to
 be
 really
 fast.
 There
 was
 also


a
 very
 strong
 sentiment
 amongst
 amongst


developers
 that
 they
 would
 only
 use
 uh


high
 performance
 terminals
 that
 were


built
 low
 level.
 So
 even
 if
 there
 were


two
 applications
 that
 were
 completely


identical
 but
 one
 was
 built
 in
 Rust,
 it


would
 just
 be
 distributed
 a
 lot
 better,


people
 would
 love
 it,
 people
 would
 uh


you
 had
 this
 at
 back
 time
 back
 then
 like


the
 Rust
 community
 was
 was
 small
 but


growing
 very
 fast
 and
 extremely


passionate.
 And
 so
 it
 was
 also
 very


important
 for
 marketing
 that
 we
 built
 it


in
 Rust.
 It
 was
 very
 really
 uh
 funny


when
 we
 decided
 to
 do
 to
 uh
 beat
 and


rust
 and
 then
 um
 Zach
 sent
 the
 O'Reilly


Rust
 book
 to
 every
 um
 everybody.
 So
 me


the
 founding
 engine
 uh
 the
 other


founding
 engineer
 a
 log
 and
 he
 and
 then


we
 would
 just
 read
 every
 day
 and
 then


every
 time
 we
 learn
 something
 new
 we're


like
 oh
 let's
 rewrite
 what
 we
 wrote


previously.
 There
 are
 way
 too
 many


unwraps
 um
 so
 let's
 go
 fix
 that.
 We
 also


had
 the
 privilege
 of
 uh
 working
 with
 uh


Nathan
 Sobo
 who
 was
 uh
 the
 inventor
 of


the
 Atom
 um
 editor
 and
 then
 eventually


started
 Zad
 and
 he
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 Rust


experience
 and
 every
 day
 he
 would
 pair


program
 with
 me
 and
 I
 just
 learned
 all


of
 the
 Rust
 um
 idioms
 that
 work
 really


well.


>> I
 guess
 pair
 programming
 does
 work.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Um,
 I
 really
 enjoyed
 pair


programming
 with
 Nathan
 uh
 because
 I


learned
 a
 lot
 of
 like
 small
 ergonomical


things
 that
 makes
 a
 big
 difference
 in
 in


using
 the
 IDE.
 You
 asked
 a
 question


earlier
 about
 like
 product
 engineering


versus
 infrastructure
 engineering.
 Um,


and
 I
 wrote
 a
 piece
 like
 many
 many
 years


ago
 before
 the
 word
 product
 engineer


even
 became
 uh
 in
 everyone's
 lexicon.


product
 engineering
 and
 product
 first


coding
 are
 like
 people
 who
 are
 more


motivated
 by
 user
 problems
 and
 excited


about
 solving
 the
 user
 impact
 and
 then


they
 see
 technology
 as
 a
 means
 to
 an


ends
 of
 user
 impact
 and
 then
 there's


like
 the
 codef
 first
 people
 who
 tend
 to


more
 map
 onto
 infrastructure
 engineering


where
 they're
 really
 excited
 about
 like


you
 know
 the
 best
 performance
 the
 best


libraries
 elegance
 I
 found
 through
 my


Robin
 Robin
 Hood
 internship
 that
 I
 very


much
 am
 like
 a
 product
 engineer
 at
 heart


um
 and
 I
 find
 that
 this
 division
 of


product
 versus
 infrastructure


engineering
 is
 a
 way
 better
 split
 to


think
 about
 engineering
 than
 front
 end


and
 back
 end.
 Um
 because
 of
 the
 mental


models
 of
 like
 people
 tend
 to
 segment


into
 like
 roughly
 speaking
 two
 camps.
 So


the
 product
 first
 people
 who
 care
 about


user
 impact,
 they
 gone
 into
 computer


science
 because
 of
 the
 things
 that


computer
 science
 can
 do
 for
 people
 and


then
 the
 second
 camp
 which
 is
 code
 first


people
 who
 are
 really
 excited
 about
 the


code
 itself
 and
 really
 excited
 about


pushing
 the
 limits
 of
 of
 code
 and
 they


tend
 to
 map
 to
 more
 infrastructural


problems.
 When
 you
 split
 people
 uh
 up
 in


front
 end
 and
 back
 end
 it's
 diff
 it's


like
 it
 does
 a
 mismatch
 in
 the
 mental


models
 of
 uh
 people
 like
 this
 is
 my


experience.
 I
 was
 a
 front
 front
 end


engineer
 at
 one
 of
 my
 internships
 and


all
 I
 was
 given
 are
 mocks
 to
 implement


and
 so
 I
 wasn't
 able
 to
 solve
 problems


for
 users.
 So
 then
 I
 felt
 like
 oh
 I
 want


to
 go
 to
 backend
 engineering
 and
 then
 in


my
 other
 internship
 I
 was
 placed
 into


infrastructure.
 So
 I
 spent
 two
 weeks


migrating
 from
 uh
 Amazon
 Athena
 to


Presto
 and
 all
 I
 did
 was
 write
 SQL
 and


migrate
 data
 database
 roles
 and
 I
 was


finally
 working
 on
 something
 was
 closer


to
 the
 metal
 but
 also
 I
 wasn't
 really


seeing
 how
 I
 was
 solving
 any
 user


problems
 and
 so
 it
 made
 me
 feel
 like
 oh


wow
 like
 maybe
 I
 don't
 really
 want
 to
 do


software
 engineering
 and
 it
 was
 only


after
 I
 got
 that
 opportunity
 and
 I
 I
 I
 I


advocated
 for
 joining
 the
 news
 tab
 team,


the
 Robin
 Hood
 news
 team
 that
 I
 finally


saw
 like
 wo
 like
 I
 actually
 really
 love


so
 solving
 user
 impact
 problems
 and
 user


problems
 and
 then
 while
 solving
 the
 user


problems
 I
 get
 to
 use
 tools
 like
 back


end
 and
 front
 end
 and
 it
 didn't
 matter


to
 me
 which
 one
 I
 was
 using
 as
 long
 as
 I


was
 solving
 the
 problem
 of
 like
 the
 user


which
 is
 what
 news
 do
 I
 see
 and
 how
 does


it
 look


>> and
 it's
 like
 I
 I
 really
 sense
 that


product
 engineer
 it's
 also
 a
 kind
 of
 a


verb
 or
 or
 phrase
 that
 that
 is
 now


spreading
 across
 startups.
 So
 many


startups
 are
 now
 hiring
 specifically


product
 engineers.
 So
 it
 is
 happening.


As
 a
 founder
 yourself,
 I
 assume
 at
 some


point
 you
 will
 hire
 product
 engineers
 if


you're
 not
 already
 hiring.
 But
 what


would
 you
 look
 for
 like
 outside
 of
 the


like
 this
 person
 can
 code
 and
 you
 know


has
 the
 basics,
 but
 what
 what
 what
 are


the
 things
 that
 will
 tell
 you
 if
 like


okay
 this
 person
 would
 be
 good
 at


product
 engineering
 versus
 just
 maybe


not
 as
 much.
 One
 key
 signal
 is
 whether


or
 not
 they
 have
 worked
 for
 a
 company


that
 was
 product
 first
 in
 nature.
 Like


if
 they
 had
 worked
 on
 uh
 more
 of
 like
 a


userfacing
 type
 SAS
 tool
 like
 Figma,


notion
 or
 Slack
 um
 you
 know
 that
 those


companies
 are
 very
 focused
 on
 product


first
 thinking
 and
 they
 pick
 people
 who


are
 product
 first.
 Um
 but
 then
 in
 an


interview
 uh
 you
 can
 also
 kind
 of
 tell


based
 on
 how
 the
 candidate
 answers


questions.
 So
 when
 you
 ask
 them
 um
 what


they
 were
 doing
 uh
 some
 pe
 at
 their


previous
 uh
 roles
 uh
 some
 people
 will


focus
 a
 lot
 on
 like
 the
 really
 cool


technology
 and
 then
 others
 will
 focus
 on


the
 business
 problem
 of
 like
 oh
 like
 you


know
 we
 were
 leaking
 $700,000
 a
 year
 to


Amazon.
 Um
 and
 so
 it
 was
 very
 important


that
 we
 migrated
 over
 to
 our
 own
 open


source
 hosted
 presto
 and
 then
 we
 did


this
 and
 then
 this
 is
 what
 happened
 to


the
 business.
 um
 as
 opposed
 to
 like
 oh


like
 you
 know
 it
 was
 very
 important
 for


us
 to
 do
 this
 thing
 and
 it
 was
 very


difficult
 because
 of
 XYZ
 reasons
 and


then
 we
 used
 this
 library
 but
 then
 this


library
 didn't
 work
 you
 know
 you
 could


really
 tell
 the
 difference
 and
 it
 was


very
 important
 also
 for
 our
 interview


process
 to
 involve
 a
 product
 round
 where


we
 asked
 uh
 people
 like
 you
 know
 what


would
 they
 change
 about
 the
 terminal


what
 would
 they
 change
 about
 a
 favorite


app
 that
 they're
 already
 using
 and
 then


the
 best
 people
 who
 are
 thinking
 in


terms
 of
 product
 would
 know
 how
 well


first
 of
 all
 would
 have
 an
 opinion
 about


how
 how
 to
 improve
 a
 product
 and
 then


second
 of
 all
 would
 know
 how
 to
 talk


about
 it
 from
 the
 users
 uh
 perspective


and
 last
 of
 all
 are
 able
 to
 create


milestones
 in
 that
 product
 based
 on
 user


visible
 milestones.
 So
 you
 would
 want
 if


you
 have
 like
 a
 hundred
 things
 to
 do,


how
 do
 you
 group
 it
 and
 sequence
 the
 the


things
 to
 do
 in
 a
 way
 where
 every


milestone
 the
 user
 could
 see
 a


difference
 as
 opposed
 to
 like
 maybe


spending
 like
 60%
 of
 your
 time
 improving


performance
 or
 latency
 that
 would
 not
 be


seen
 by
 the
 user
 until
 this
 front
 end


was
 added
 for
 example.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I'm
 I'm
 hearing
 that
 like


understanding
 the
 business,
 caring
 about


the
 product,
 like
 having
 a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 we
 might
 have
 associated
 purely
 in


the
 past
 with
 just
 product
 managers,


having
 some
 of
 that
 is
 increasingly


important.
 And
 you
 know
 for
 engineers


who
 have
 none
 of
 it,
 that's
 also
 fine.


But
 it
 it
 feels
 like
 increasingly
 they


might
 be
 a
 better
 fit
 for
 infrastructure


work
 or
 places
 where
 you
 don't
 need
 to


think
 about
 product.
 there's
 like


someone
 or
 a
 company
 where
 there
 is
 a


product
 manager
 and
 they
 they
 take
 care


of
 all
 of
 that
 and
 it's
 just


implementation
 which
 sounds
 a
 little
 bit


less
 fun
 but
 these
 places
 exist
 and
 some


people
 there
 are
 engineers
 who


appreciate
 this


>> there
 are
 so
 many
 I
 mean
 and
 they're
 all


extremely
 important
 um
 when
 you
 are


you're
 at
 a
 company
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 scale


like
 really
 like
 performance
 memory
 like


the
 infrastructure
 you
 use
 is
 so


important
 but
 then
 when
 you're
 talking


about
 startups
 you're
 just
 starting
 out


and
 so
 you
 need
 someone
 who
 is
 um
 able


to
 plug
 in
 all
 the
 holes
 in
 a
 company


and
 that
 the
 scale
 at
 the
 very
 beginning


doesn't
 tend
 to
 be
 something
 that


requires
 like
 that
 many
 billions
 of


roles
 to
 handle
 um
 or
 like
 uh
 requests


per
 second
 to
 handle.


>> Yeah.
 So
 you've
 you've
 been
 a
 founding


engineer,
 you're
 now
 a
 founder.
 Clearly


you're
 also
 hiring
 founding
 engineers


and
 at
 Warp
 you
 also
 hired
 product


engineers.
 How
 do
 you
 think
 a
 product


engineer
 versus
 a
 founding
 engineer


differs
 or
 or
 do
 they
 is
 it
 just
 the


timing
 or
 is
 it
 also
 a
 little
 bit
 of


different
 personality
 or
 different
 kind


of
 challenges?


>> Yeah,
 that's
 a
 very
 good
 question.
 Um,


so
 I
 would
 say
 like
 founding
 engineer


versus
 product
 engineer,
 they're
 like


different
 exes.
 So
 you
 could
 be
 a


founding
 product
 engineer.
 Uh,
 you
 could


be
 a
 founding
 infrastructure
 engineer.


Um
 um
 or
 you
 could
 be
 like
 a
 later
 stage


product
 engineer,
 later
 stage


infrastructure
 engineer,
 um
 later
 later


stage
 uh
 software
 engineer,
 uh
 AI


engineer.
 Um
 I
 think
 that
 folks
 might


differ
 on
 the
 definition,
 but
 I
 think


founding
 engineer
 counts
 if
 you
 are
 in


the
 first
 five
 or
 so
 that
 joins
 within


the
 first
 few
 months
 of
 the
 company


starting.
 A
 product
 engineer
 in
 my


definition
 is
 someone
 who
 is
 excited


about
 solving
 uh
 user
 problems
 and
 they


are
 full
 stack
 in
 being
 able
 to
 do
 that.


So
 they
 could
 go
 in
 and
 build
 a


front-end
 feature,
 a
 backend
 feature
 or


something
 that's
 end
 to
 end.
 They
 could


also
 go
 into
 AI.
 Um
 they
 could
 go
 into


infrastructure.
 They
 would
 use
 whatever


tools
 in
 the
 tool
 belt
 of
 programming
 to


solve
 the
 problem
 for
 the
 user.
 I
 think


these
 days
 the
 way
 that
 startups
 are


putting
 these
 job
 descriptions
 out
 um
 I


think
 that
 they're
 actually
 more
 looking


for
 purely
 front-end
 engineers
 um
 no
 one


uses
 the
 term
 front-end
 engineers


anymore.
 I
 think
 when
 someone
 is
 like


reading
 a
 job
 description,
 one
 should


read
 it
 closely
 because
 I
 think
 that
 a


lot
 of
 startups
 here
 are
 using
 the
 word


product
 engineer
 more
 as
 a
 kind
 of
 like


a
 synonym
 for
 front-
 end
 only


engineering.
 So,
 so
 like
 not
 all
 of
 them


mean
 the
 product
 engine
 that
 we
 were


talking
 about.


>> Yeah.


>> What
 what
 what
 do
 you
 think
 today
 at


your
 startup
 for
 example
 now
 that
 we


have
 all
 these
 AI
 tools?
 Do
 you
 think


it's
 going
 to
 push
 us
 away
 from
 even


pair
 programming
 even
 if
 people
 are
 in


the
 same
 space
 or
 or
 or
 do
 you
 think
 you


know
 the
 the
 people
 who
 still
 do
 it
 are


actually
 going
 to
 benefit
 a
 lot
 from
 it?


I
 think
 almost
 like
 with
 the
 rise
 of
 AI,


everyone


now
 is
 pair
 programming
 with
 an
 AI
 and


having
 someone
 to
 talk
 to
 or
 some
 bot
 to


talk
 to
 allows
 everyone
 to
 have
 a
 rubber


duck
 every
 day
 and
 that
 helps
 everyone


get
 better.
 Um
 I
 think
 that
 with
 the


rise
 of
 the
 return
 to
 office
 um
 there's


also
 a
 lot
 more
 opportunities
 for


sitting
 next
 to
 each
 other
 and
 just


learning
 how
 people
 use
 their
 tools
 that


we
 didn't
 get
 during
 the
 remote
 time
 cuz


Warp
 was
 remote
 first
 and
 um
 during
 the


first
 two
 years
 I
 I
 don't
 think
 I
 I
 ever


saw
 Zach
 in
 person.


>> Oh
 wow.
 Yeah.


>> Yeah.
 During
 2020


>> of
 course
 it
 was
 that
 time.
 At
 your


current
 startup
 how
 much
 are
 at
 Flint?


How
 much
 are
 you
 using
 AI?


>> Oh,
 um,
 all
 the
 time.
 Like
 it's
 almost
 a


requirement
 at
 this
 point
 to
 use
 AI
 to


code.
 Uh,
 cuz
 then
 you
 can
 be
 more


productive.


>> What
 are
 your
 favorite
 tools
 or
 your


common
 commonly
 the
 tools
 that
 you
 reach


for?


>> Always
 cloud
 code.


>> Do
 you
 still
 use
 the
 ID
 or
 not
 as
 much


or
 to
 re
 review
 stuff?


>> So,
 we
 use
 cloud
 code
 inside
 the
 IDE.


>> Mhm.


>> Yeah.


>> Inside
 VS
 Code
 or
 or
 I'm
 not
 sure
 if
 you


can
 do
 cursor
 or
 one
 of
 them.
 It's


cursor
 and
 then
 we
 have
 an
 engineer
 who


only
 codes
 on
 Vim.
 So
 he
 uses
 cloud
 code


on
 Vim.


>> Oh
 but
 then
 runs
 there
 as
 well.
 That's


pretty
 cool.
 It's
 crazy
 how
 how
 quickly


we've
 we've
 changed
 from
 like
 ID
 only
 or


most
 engineers
 to
 to
 actually
 just
 like


warming
 up
 to
 this.


>> Yeah,
 technology
 gets
 better.
 One


interesting
 topic
 that
 you
 mentioned


earlier
 is
 some
 cautionary
 tales
 about


how
 when
 you're
 joining
 an
 early
 stage


startup,
 especially
 an
 AI
 startup,
 some


engineers
 can
 feel
 a
 little
 bit
 like


screwed
 by
 founders
 and
 and
 you
 know
 I
 I


I
 think
 you
 know
 we
 talked
 about
 how
 you


managed
 to
 like
 you
 know
 get
 a
 great


offer
 at
 an
 AI
 company
 with
 a
 a
 founder


who
 like
 checked
 all
 the
 boxes
 but
 I


think
 it's
 important
 to
 talk
 about
 some


negative
 patterns
 you
 might
 have
 seen
 or


heard
 and
 and
 how
 to
 avoid
 it
 because


again
 there's
 an
 explosion
 of
 startups


of
 AI
 startups
 of
 founders
 uh
 who
 want


to
 recruit
 engineers
 and
 sometimes
 I


guess
 uh
 things
 can
 be
 too
 good
 to
 be


true.


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 I
 I'm
 sensing
 a
 lot


amongst
 my
 friends
 as
 well
 that
 people


feel
 like
 um
 specifically
 uh
 the
 founder


might
 be
 acquihired
 away
 uh
 by
 a
 bigger


company
 and
 then
 be
 the
 only
 one
 in
 the


company
 that
 received
 any
 monetary


benefit
 from


>> so
 that
 that
 we've
 seen
 in
 in
 the
 news.


>> Yeah.


>> Some
 of
 the
 founders
 being
 hired
 away


and
 then
 the
 team
 is
 left
 hanging.


>> That
 is
 the
 specific
 scenario
 that


people
 are
 really
 scared
 of.
 And
 I


actually
 had
 a
 friend
 who
 told
 me
 that


because
 of
 all
 these
 um
 equity
 hires
 of


the
 founders
 that's
 happening
 like
 she's


just
 she's
 just
 going
 to
 join
 OpenAI


instead
 because
 it's
 safe.
 I
 think
 it's


all
 about
 uh
 really
 understanding
 the


character
 of
 the
 founder.
 One
 great
 way


to
 find
 out
 about
 the
 founder
 is
 to
 do


reference
 checks
 like
 is
 this
 yeah
 is


this
 someone
 who
 actually
 has
 good


character
 who
 is
 generous
 with
 their


people
 who
 care
 about
 their
 team.
 Um
 the


other
 good
 pro
 uh
 approximator
 is
 to
 see


if
 the
 founder
 themselves
 were
 founding


engineers
 to
 begin
 with
 because
 that's


just
 like
 that
 lived
 experience
 and


empathy
 that
 you
 just
 cannot
 get
 unless


you
 went
 through
 the
 um
 the
 ritual
 of


having
 been
 a
 founding
 engineer
 where


you're
 in
 there.
 You
 know
 the
 day
 that


there
 wasn't
 even
 any
 code
 to
 the
 day


that
 there
 was
 code
 and
 then
 the
 day
 we


had
 our
 first
 user.
 um
 the
 days
 where
 we


didn't
 have
 the
 first
 user
 like
 all
 that


like
 pain
 and
 struggles
 to
 now
 have
 like


all
 these
 this
 empathy
 that
 hey
 like


these
 folks
 are
 entrusting
 me
 with
 their


career
 and
 they're
 taking
 a
 lot
 of
 risk


um
 I
 cannot
 see
 a
 world
 in
 which
 I


wouldn't
 offer
 uh
 secondaries
 and
 tender


offers
 um
 and
 opportunities
 to
 them.


It's
 a
 big
 sacrifice


>> and
 and
 maybe
 it's
 even
 worth
 asking
 on


the
 interview
 specifically
 these


questions
 that
 if
 the
 company
 was
 to
 was


to
 have
 some
 as
 a
 kind
 of
 raise
 a
 new


round
 and
 man
 the
 founders
 would
 take


secondaries
 would
 it
 be
 offered
 to
 other


employees
 if
 there
 was
 an
 acquisition
 to


happen
 would
 you
 bring
 the
 team
 with
 you


I
 guess
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 binding
 but
 I


feel
 there
 is
 difference
 between
 when


people
 don't
 ask
 and
 everyone
 just


assumes
 versus
 it
 doesn't
 hurt
 too
 much


to
 ask
 potentially
 especially
 if
 it's
 a


a
 startup
 that
 seems
 to
 have
 just
 a


rocket
 ship
 trajectory.


>> Oh
 yeah,
 absolutely.
 You
 definitely
 have


the
 the
 leverage
 to
 ask
 that
 uh
 in
 in


this
 times.


>> It's
 I
 mean
 it's
 an
 innocent
 enough


question,
 right?
 Worst
 thing
 is
 they


they
 don't
 answer
 it
 or
 or
 they
 refuse


to
 answer
 or
 they
 can
 say
 something,


right?
 And
 then
 you
 have
 some
 data


point.


>> Yeah.
 The
 other
 thing
 is
 also
 to
 not


listen
 too
 hard
 on
 what
 their
 answer
 is


and
 to
 listen
 to
 whether
 or
 not
 they
 had


thought
 about
 it
 before.
 When
 I
 was


asking
 Zach
 about
 like
 how
 he
 thought


about
 early
 employees,
 like
 it
 was
 very


clear
 that
 he
 had
 been
 thinking
 about
 it


for
 years.
 And
 so
 the
 answer
 that
 came


out
 was
 very
 well
 thought
 out
 and
 it
 was


a
 really
 obvious
 thing
 for
 him
 to
 be


thinking
 about
 whereas
 like
 you
 know
 a


less
 thoughtful
 manager
 might
 give
 you
 a


good
 answer
 but
 it's
 very
 clear
 they


just
 came
 up
 with
 it
 on
 the
 spot.
 So
 now


that
 you
 have
 a
 startup
 and
 you
 know
 you


you've
 now
 moved
 from
 from
 again
 being


being
 uh
 working
 at
 companies
 to
 being
 a


founding
 engineer
 to
 now
 founding
 your


own
 company
 and
 congratulations
 on


coming
 out
 from
 stealth.


>> Thank
 you


>> with
 with
 Flint.
 Uh
 how
 do
 you
 find
 what


does
 it
 take
 to
 hire
 worldclass


engineers
 in
 an
 environment
 like
 Silicon


Valley
 or
 with
 other
 founders
 you're


talking
 to
 and
 also
 from
 your
 own


experience?
 I
 think
 it's
 about
 um


showing
 that
 you
 care
 a
 lot
 about
 the


team
 um
 and
 that
 you
 value
 people
 on


your
 team
 and
 that
 there's
 high
 trust


between
 you
 and
 them
 that
 you
 will
 do


every
 measure
 it
 takes
 to
 make
 sure
 that


they
 are
 going
 to
 have
 a
 good
 time.
 Um,


and
 then
 it's
 also
 about
 having
 really


big
 vision
 about
 how
 this
 company
 is


going
 to
 change
 the
 world
 and
 it's
 going


to
 be
 huge
 and
 that
 this
 is
 a
 chance
 to


change
 the
 world.


>> Speaking
 of
 which,
 uh,
 your
 your
 your


startup
 Flint,
 C,
 can
 we
 talk
 about
 how


you
 came
 up
 with
 the
 idea
 around


websites
 and
 also
 how
 you
 know
 both
 what


you're
 building
 but
 also
 how
 you're


thinking
 these
 AI
 agents
 will
 change
 the


world,
 the
 web.
 So
 the
 website
 itself


become
 agentic.
 They
 build
 themselves.


That
 means
 um
 that
 if
 you
 wake
 up
 in
 the


morning
 to
 a
 competitor
 having
 launched


overnight,
 your
 website
 would
 have


already
 generated
 you
 a
 comparison
 page


that
 compares
 you
 with
 the
 competitor


and
 then
 it's
 already
 optimizing
 for


conversions
 and
 it's
 also
 keeping
 track


of
 the
 differences
 in
 your
 product
 and


them
 every
 day
 and
 then
 updating
 it.
 So


something
 that
 would
 have
 taken
 five


agencies
 three
 months
 to
 do
 suddenly


gets
 done
 overnight
 when
 you
 were


sleeping.
 And
 we're
 thinking
 of
 also


automating
 all
 of
 the
 other
 marketing


workflows
 around
 that.
 Like
 we
 can
 hook


into
 your
 sales
 calls
 and
 your
 gong


calls
 and
 then
 find
 out
 ways
 of
 selling


your
 product
 or
 solution
 pages
 that
 you


might
 be
 missing.


>> Oh
 wow.


>> Um
 yeah,


>> this
 is
 proper
 next
 level.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 Like
 marketers
 really
 love


this.
 I
 mean,
 I'm
 not
 just
 talking


obviously
 from
 the
 marketing
 angle,
 but


just
 from
 a
 from
 a
 software
 engineering


and
 how
 you
 have
 like
 all
 these
 like


different
 input
 channels
 to
 capture


feedback
 and
 then
 to
 eventually
 generate


this
 sounds
 really
 cool.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 it
 is
 uh
 bringing
 autonomy
 to


the
 to
 the
 web.
 we
 we're
 really
 building


a
 new
 kind
 of
 uh
 internet
 here
 where
 uh


the
 website
 is
 now
 not
 only
 generated
 by


AI
 and
 for
 AI
 but
 it's
 also
 becoming
 AI


itself
 um
 to
 be
 more
 dynamic
 and


proactive
 um
 um
 my
 co-founder
 actually


ran
 teams
 at
 Neuro
 which
 is
 an


autonomous
 vehicle
 company
 and
 we
 talk
 a


lot
 about
 how
 autonomous
 websites
 are


similar
 to
 autonomous
 vehicles
 in
 that


it
 does
 they
 they
 take
 in
 data
 through
 a


perception
 system.
 Then
 there's
 a


decision-m
 system
 about
 okay
 like
 based


on
 this
 comp
 competitor
 based
 on
 these


sales
 calls
 like
 what
 should
 we
 do
 and


then
 it
 would
 then
 have
 a
 control
 system


that
 then
 actually
 implements
 the
 pages


and
 then
 it
 would
 then
 start
 off
 that


loop
 again
 where
 based
 on
 how
 the
 page


is
 doing
 in
 the
 environment
 which
 is
 the


market
 what
 should
 we
 then
 do?
 So
 by


putting
 all
 of
 that
 perception,
 that


decision-m
 and
 control
 uh
 systems
 into


the
 same
 entity,
 we
 finally
 close
 the


feedback
 loop.
 That
 is
 the
 reason
 why
 it


requires
 five
 agencies
 talking
 to
 each


other
 to
 build
 a
 page.
 We
 had
 to
 have


the
 five
 agencies
 because
 there
 were


separate
 tools
 and
 different
 specialties


to
 be
 passing
 information
 between.
 And


now
 if
 you
 put
 all
 of
 the
 tools
 in
 the


same
 entity,
 you
 start
 having
 a
 closed


loop
 where
 the
 website
 continuously


optimizes
 itself
 for
 your
 business.
 It's


very
 exciting.
 Um,
 so
 the
 first
 phase
 is


that
 which
 is
 let's
 respond
 to
 your


market
 based
 on
 real
 real-time
 data


streams.
 And
 then
 the
 next
 phase
 will
 be


real-time
 morphing
 and
 shape-shifting
 of


the
 page
 based
 on
 who
 is
 visiting.
 It


could
 be
 a
 healthcare
 executive
 that


comes
 and
 then
 we
 morph
 the
 page
 to


highlight
 uh
 healthcare
 case
 studies
 or


like
 uh
 compliance
 related
 requirements


from
 healthcare
 and
 then
 we
 could
 even


generate
 a
 sales
 demo
 that's


specifically
 for
 that
 healthcare


executive
 instead
 of
 needing
 to
 click


contact
 sales
 and
 then
 wait
 a
 week
 for
 a


Zoom
 call
 where
 someone
 is
 extremely


bored
 talking
 to
 you.
 just
 have
 the
 the


website
 generate
 a
 demo
 closely
 on
 the


spot
 and
 then
 if
 it's
 an
 AI
 agent
 that's


visiting
 we
 can
 also
 speak
 different
 the


website
 could
 also
 speak
 differently
 the


agent
 doesn't
 want
 to
 speak
 in
 HTML
 uh


they
 want
 to
 speak
 in
 MCP
 they
 want
 to


speak
 in
 tool
 calls
 APIs
 markdown
 JSON


um
 there
 is
 a
 new
 agentto
 agent
 protocol


that
 we're
 building
 here
 um
 to
 redefine


the
 way
 that
 uh
 agents
 interact
 with
 the


web
 we
 also
 create
 the
 concept
 of
 a


aentic
 web
 where
 instead
 of
 going
 to


Google
 uh
 to
 find
 uh
 links.
 You
 could


have
 the
 agents
 talk
 with
 each
 other
 to


tell
 which
 agents
 are
 more
 credible
 than


others
 and
 um
 be
 able
 to
 communicate


very
 quickly
 um
 to
 help
 to
 sell
 uh
 a


customer
 on
 a
 deal.
 This
 is
 so


interesting
 because
 I
 I
 feel
 like
 we're


so
 focused
 right
 now
 or
 at
 least
 I'm
 f


so
 focused
 on
 how
 uh
 LLMs
 can
 help


developer
 tools
 like
 just
 you
 know


change
 how
 how
 we
 do
 things
 that
 we
 kind


of
 forget
 that
 there's
 a
 whole
 world
 out


there
 where
 where
 these
 tools
 can
 really


just
 you
 know
 like
 change
 a
 bunch
 of


stuff
 like
 how
 how
 we
 think
 of
 websites


and
 how
 dynamic
 they
 are
 and
 how
 like


ultra
 dynamic
 or
 ultra
 personalized
 they


can
 be.
 This
 is
 really
 cool.


>> Yeah.
 uh
 everything
 we
 know
 about
 the


internet
 is
 about
 to
 change
 and
 and
 uh


Flynn
 is
 building
 that
 even
 today.
 One


really
 interesting
 problem
 that
 we're


solving
 uh
 it's
 almost
 a
 research
 level


problem
 it's
 in
 terms
 of
 creating


onbrand
 landing
 pages.
 So
 it
 might
 seem


very
 simple
 from
 the
 outside
 cuz
 like
 oh


like
 can't
 we
 just
 like
 choose
 the


background
 color
 um
 and
 the
 typography


of
 a
 page
 and
 then
 turn
 out
 a
 page.


Turns
 out
 that
 like
 especially
 today


brand
 is
 very
 important.
 Um
 you
 wouldn't


put
 a
 l
 if
 you're
 a
 SAS
 company
 you


wouldn't
 put
 like
 a
 like
 a
 cursor


generated
 page
 in
 front
 of
 a
 Fortune
 500


client
 you're
 trying
 to
 trying
 to
 close.


You
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 that
 your
 page


really
 matches
 your
 brand
 down
 to
 the


very
 pixel.
 Um
 and
 we
 have
 developed


that
 capability
 in
 in
 Flint
 to
 create
 a


page
 that
 looks
 almost
 as
 if
 the


customer
 themselves
 built
 it.
 So
 like
 uh


we
 work
 with
 cognition
 uh
 on
 the
 events


pages
 as
 well
 as
 their
 comparison
 pages


between
 windsurf
 and
 cursor
 for
 example


and
 that's
 being
 cited
 by
 looms.


>> So
 it
 feels
 to
 me
 you
 know
 you've
 got
 an


exposed
 like
 you
 like
 one
 part
 of
 how


you
 got
 here
 maybe
 you've
 got
 otherwise


but
 it
 feels
 you
 really
 got
 here
 because


you
 were
 at
 a
 founding
 engineer
 at
 a


startup
 you've
 seen
 so
 many
 things.
 So


what
 would
 your
 advice
 be
 to
 software


engineers
 who
 would
 love
 to
 join
 as
 a


founding
 engineer
 maybe
 an
 AI
 startup
 or


a
 fast
 grow
 startup
 these
 days
 a
 lot
 of


them
 are
 AI
 not
 all
 of
 them
 uh
 if
 if
 if


it's
 someone
 who
 you
 know
 has
 some


experience
 in
 the
 field
 what
 tactics
 you


think
 might
 work
 for
 them


>> it's
 about
 uh
 showing
 that
 you've
 built


in
 AI
 before
 cuz
 that
 skill
 is
 very
 much


high
 in
 in
 demand
 and
 it's
 very
 new
 Very


few
 people
 relatively
 speaking
 and
 have


ever
 built
 an
 AI
 product
 before.
 So
 just


spending
 like
 some
 time
 over
 weekends


knowing
 how
 to
 build
 an
 AI
 product


already
 helps
 you
 stand
 out
 above
 many


people.


>> Yeah.
 And
 by
 an
 AI
 product,
 we
 mean


something
 that
 is
 is
 using
 LLM


underneath
 the
 hood
 to
 to
 do
 what


whatever
 it
 might
 be.
 I
 don't
 know,
 may


that
 be
 just
 a
 search
 engine
 based
 on


LLM
 or
 or
 anything
 that
 scratches
 your


itch.
 Yeah,
 really
 any
 anything
 that


scratches
 your
 itch
 that
 uses
 um
 any
 of


the
 the
 models,
 the
 completion
 APIs.
 In


terms
 of
 excelling
 in
 that
 role,
 it


starts
 off
 with
 picking
 the
 right


founder.
 Um
 but
 then
 once
 you
 do
 join,


it's
 all
 about
 volunteering
 to
 do
 the


things
 that
 uh
 no
 one
 no
 one
 wants
 to


do,
 but
 it's
 the
 most
 important
 thing


for
 the
 business.
 Um,
 so
 I
 did
 what
 most


engineers
 would
 consider
 to
 be
 the
 worst


job
 ever,
 which
 is
 to
 be
 the
 face
 of
 the


company
 on
 Hacker
 News
 at
 Warp.
 So
 I


wrote
 the
 blog
 posts,
 I
 published
 them


on
 on
 Hacker
 News
 and
 I
 answered
 all
 the


questions
 on
 on
 Hacker
 News.
 Um,
 I
 went


out
 there
 and
 I
 created
 our
 company


Twitter
 and
 I
 was
 writing
 tweets
 for
 the


company.
 Then
 starting
 a
 YouTube
 channel


for
 the
 for
 the
 company
 before
 any


developer
 tool
 companies
 really
 thought


about
 doing
 YouTube.
 starting
 a
 discord


channel
 like
 filing
 every
 feedback


starting
 the
 GitHub
 like
 things
 that


like
 very
 different
 like
 outside
 of


engineering
 but
 the
 business
 really


needed


>> and
 and
 then
 you
 still
 doing
 your


engineering
 job
 you're
 still
 like
 you


know
 like
 fixing
 bug
 and
 etc
 but
 on
 on


the
 top
 of
 it
 that
 you're
 figuring
 out


how
 to
 help
 the
 company
 right


>> yeah
 yeah
 you
 you
 still
 have
 to
 make


sure
 that
 you're
 doing
 your
 your
 number


one
 job
 which
 is
 software
 engineering
 so


that
 needs
 to
 still
 stay
 the
 main
 focus


and
 you
 should
 only
 volunteer
 for
 other


stuff
 if
 you
 are
 already
 doing
 well
 in


your
 main
 job.
 The
 benefit
 of
 doing
 a


lot
 of
 these
 things
 and
 learning
 how
 to


do
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 things
 um
 is
 that
 then


um
 you
 get
 to
 learn
 um
 what
 businesses


need.
 You
 know,
 you
 can
 come
 up
 with


ideas
 that
 are
 not
 like
 just
 developer


tool
 companies
 um
 for
 example.
 And
 at


one
 point
 because
 I
 was
 doing
 all
 these


things
 and
 then
 hiring
 all
 the
 people
 I


remember
 like
 it
 was
 after
 one
 of
 the


board
 meetings
 my
 my
 founder
 reached
 out


to
 me
 and
 said
 that
 hey
 like
 Michelle


like
 you
 hired
 all
 these
 people
 in


growth
 I
 want
 you
 to
 be
 head
 of
 growth


you're
 going
 to
 be
 starting
 and
 managing


this
 team
 from
 now
 on
 and
 I
 don't
 know
 I


was
 like
 22
 at
 the
 time
 and
 suddenly


executive
 suddenly
 reporting
 to
 the


board
 every
 quarter
 on
 that
 like
 wow
 wow


numbers
 and
 revenue
 you
 wouldn't
 get


that
 uh
 unless
 you
 volunteer
 to
 do


random
 things
 and
 then
 um
 mo
 make
 sure


that
 every
 time
 you
 do
 this
 you
 do
 them


ex
 exceedingly
 well
 cuz
 it's
 not


necessarily
 just
 about
 doing
 well
 in


that
 like
 domain.
 It's
 about
 the
 founder


knowing
 that
 whenever
 they
 pass
 you
 a


job
 to
 be
 done
 it
 will
 be
 done


excellently.


>> Yeah.


>> Um
 and
 then
 this
 way
 you
 get
 more
 and


more
 responsibilities.
 Eventually
 I


ended
 up
 leading
 enterprise
 sales
 for


warp.


>> Oh
 wow.
 Um
 because
 we
 had
 this
 problem


where
 we
 started
 getting
 a
 lot
 of


security
 questionnaires
 from
 companies


that
 were
 using
 warp
 and
 I
 saw
 that


problem
 and
 I
 was
 like
 oh
 this
 is
 not
 a


security
 problem.
 This
 is
 an
 enterprise


sales
 opportunity.
 This
 is
 the
 start
 of


a
 conversation
 in
 which
 if
 we
 have
 an


enterprise
 deal
 we
 could
 we
 could
 fill


your
 questionnaires
 and
 we
 could
 have


sock
 to
 reports
 and
 we
 could
 have
 all


these
 nice
 compliance
 controls
 and
 admin


panel
 if
 you
 paid
 us
 like
 you
 know
 this


amount
 of
 money.
 Yeah,
 it's
 things
 like


this
 that
 really
 help
 you
 um
 do
 well
 in


a
 company.
 It's
 doing
 the
 things
 that


are
 very
 unsexy
 that
 nobody
 wants
 to
 do


because
 before
 you
 know
 it,
 you
 might
 be


running
 enterprise
 sales
 because
 no
 one


no
 one
 wanted
 to
 work
 on
 security


questionnaires.
 It
 was
 a
 hot
 potato
 that


was
 passed
 around
 multiple
 quarters


until
 it
 went
 to
 me.
 And
 and
 I
 guess


it's
 probably
 needless
 to
 say,
 but
 if


you
 are
 working
 as
 a
 founding
 engineer


or
 like
 and
 you're
 or
 or
 even
 as
 a


software
 engineer,
 you're
 picking
 up
 all


these
 things
 and
 you're
 balancing
 all


these
 things
 and
 from
 the
 outside
 it's


like
 how
 are
 you
 doing
 all
 these
 things?


I
 guess
 as
 a
 founder,
 it's
 kind
 of


preparing
 you
 to
 be
 a
 founder
 because
 as


a
 founder,
 you're
 you'll
 definitely
 have


to
 balance
 all
 you
 know
 all
 these
 hot


potatoes
 at
 the
 same
 time.


>> Oh
 yeah.
 as
 a
 the
 job
 of
 a
 founder
 and
 a


manager
 is
 to
 always
 like
 it's
 always


about
 taking
 the
 things
 that
 no
 one


wants
 to
 do
 so
 that
 everyone
 else
 can
 be


in
 their
 zone
 of
 genius.
 They
 can
 spend


all
 their
 time
 working
 on
 this


engineering
 problem
 and
 yes
 I
 will
 deal


with
 a
 news


>> as
 closing
 let's
 just
 do
 some
 rapid


questions.
 I'm
 going
 to
 ask
 a
 question


and
 then
 you
 tell
 me
 what
 comes
 to
 mind.


Sounds
 good.


>> Yeah,
 that
 sounds
 great.


>> What's
 your
 favorite
 programming


language
 and
 why?


>> Oh,
 Rust.


I
 feel
 like
 I
 get
 a
 lot
 of
 satisfaction


every
 time
 I
 pass
 through
 borrow
 checker


cuz
 it's
 very
 difficult
 to
 write
 code


that
 compiles.


>> And
 at
 Flint,
 you
 use
 Rust
 as
 well.


>> Uh
 Flint,
 we
 are
 a
 TypeScript
 shop.
 We


are
 building
 autonomous
 websites
 and


we're
 building
 uh
 websites
 that
 build


themselves
 with
 like
 you
 know
 so
 it
 is


helpful
 to
 be
 writing
 in
 a
 language
 that


builds
 the
 website.


>> I'm
 sure
 Russ
 will
 find
 his
 way
 in
 there


sooner
 or
 later.


>> All right,
 we'll
 see.
 What
 are
 one
 or


two
 movies
 that
 you
 would
 recommend
 that


you
 enjoyed?


>> Yeah,
 I
 really
 enjoyed
 uh
 Weapons.
 It


looks
 like
 a
 horror
 movie
 on
 the


outside,
 but
 it
 is
 very
 enjoyable.
 Um


there
 are
 many
 uh
 comedic
 moments
 in
 it


and
 I
 also
 really
 enjoyed
 the
 nonlinear


narrative
 where
 it
 it's
 a
 story
 about


sometime
 in
 the
 early
 2000s
 there
 were


children
 who
 started
 running
 out
 of


their
 houses
 at
 uh
 2:00
 a.m.
 And
 then


they
 all
 disappeared
 for
 a
 month.
 And


then
 the
 movie,
 this
 is just
 a
 real
 life


story.
 And
 then
 the
 movie
 creates
 a


narrative
 for
 like
 what
 could
 have


happened.
 And
 then
 every
 chapter
 in
 the


movie
 was
 showing
 a
 different
 uh


character's
 perspective.
 And
 every


perspective
 added
 a
 different
 way
 of


viewing
 the
 story
 altogether
 and
 almost


changed
 the
 genre
 each
 time.
 And
 as
 a


horror
 movie
 fan,
 I
 also
 saw
 that
 every


chapter
 was
 a
 different
 character
 in
 a


horror
 movie
 trope.
 Um,
 which
 I
 also


found
 like
 was
 really
 smart.
 Um,
 so


yeah,
 highly
 recommend
 it.


>> I
 am
 not
 a
 horror
 movie
 fan.
 I
 watched


this
 movie
 not
 knowing
 what
 I
 got
 myself


in.
 I
 will
 say
 it's
 memorable.
 It
 still


gives
 me
 the
 shivers
 and
 it
 it
 still


makes
 me
 think.
 So
 great
 recommendation.


Thank
 you.


>> I
 do
 recommend.


>> So
 Michelle,
 thanks
 for
 being
 on
 the


podcast.
 This
 was
 just
 really


interesting
 to
 see,
 you
 know,
 like
 how


how
 much
 you
 can
 learn
 being
 as
 a


founding
 engineer,
 how
 you
 can
 do
 it,


and
 how
 it
 can
 lead
 to
 starting
 your
 own


company,
 doing
 super
 exciting
 things


with
 Flint.
 So
 good
 luck.
 Good
 luck
 with


Flint
 and
 thanks
 for
 being
 here.


>> Thank
 you
 so
 much.


>> I
 always
 find
 it
 interesting
 to
 hear
 how


someone
 became
 a
 founder
 [music]
 and


Michelle's
 story
 felt
 pretty


approachable
 to
 me.
 What
 really
 got
 my


attention
 was
 how
 Michelle
 was


volunteering
 to
 do
 the
 unattractive


work.
 In
 this
 case,
 working
 with
 a


marketing
 agency
 to
 build
 marketing


websites
 at
 Warp.
 [music]
 And
 this
 got


her
 the
 idea
 and
 expertise
 to
 start
 her


current
 startup,
 which
 is
 about
 creating


marketing
 and
 launch
 websites
 with
 AI.


Michelle's
 [music]
 story
 is
 a
 great


reminder
 that
 to
 be
 a
 great
 founder,
 you


probably
 need
 more
 than
 just
 software


engineering.
 It's
 also
 helpful
 if
 you


understand
 different
 parts
 of
 the


business
 [music]
 and
 you
 get
 your
 hands


dirty
 with
 non-
 tech
 work
 as
 well.
 One


other
 thing
 I
 found
 interesting
 is
 how


Michelle
 thinks
 that
 GEO,
 [music]


generative
 engine
 optimization,


basically
 LM's
 recommending
 websites,


will
 soon
 become
 perhaps
 even
 more


important
 than
 search
 engine


optimization.
 Things
 are
 changing
 fast


[music]
 in
 the
 web
 thanks
 to
 AI
 and


perhaps
 web
 pages
 will
 become
 a
 lot
 more


responsive
 and
 fluid
 thanks
 to
 AI
 and
 in


response
 to
 LLMs.
