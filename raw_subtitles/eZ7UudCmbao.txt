All
 righty.
 We
 are
 on
 our
 way
 up
 through


the
 West
 Wing,
 past
 the
 press


secretary's
 office,
 past
 the
 uh
 cabinet


room,


>> sitting
 under
 a
 great
 portrait
 of
 George


Washington
 in
 his
 younger
 days.


>> Come
 on,
 guys.


>> You
 ready
 for
 us?


>> Come
 on
 inside.


>> From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm
 Michael


Barbaro.
 This
 is
 the
 Daily.


>> How
 are
 you?


>> Good.
 Good
 to
 see
 you,
 Mr.
 President.


Did
 you
 see
 that?
 Just
 came
 out.


>> Number
 one
 on
 Tik
 Tok.
 Trump.


>> All
 right.


>> I'm
 a
 little
 older
 than
 the
 average
 age


on
 Tik
 Tok.


>> On
 Wednesday
 night,
 in
 the
 middle
 of
 a


defining
 moment
 for
 President
 Trump's


second
 term.


>> Well,
 thank
 you,
 Mr.
 President,
 for


seeing
 us.
 You
 know,
 everybody,


>> I
 do.
 I
 do.
 You


>> Katie
 Rogers.


>> Hi,
 Katie.


>> And
 of
 course,
 Tyler.


>> Nice
 to
 see
 you.


>> Four
 White
 House
 reporters
 from
 the


Times
 sat
 down
 with
 him
 for
 an
 extended


interview
 in
 the
 Oval
 Office.
 Did
 you


see
 my
 various
 truths
 today?
 They
 were


sort
 of


>> they
 were
 sort
 of
 sparkling
 sparkling


>> today.
 One
 of
 them,
 David
 Sanger,
 walks


us
 through
 their
 conversation.


[Music]


It's
 Friday,
 January
 9th.


[Music]


So,
 David,
 four
 New
 York
 Times
 reporters


walk
 into
 the
 Oval
 Office.
 What
 could


possibly
 go
 wrong?


>> Sounds
 like
 a
 the
 setup
 to
 a
 punch
 line.


Tell
 us
 about
 this
 experience.


>> Well,
 the
 president's
 second
 term
 is


about
 to
 hit
 its
 one-year
 mark.
 And
 I


think
 it's
 a
 considerable
 understatement


for
 anybody
 who's
 been
 listening
 to
 the


Daily
 or
 reading
 the
 Times
 to
 say
 that


this
 is
 truly
 one
 of
 the
 most
 pivotal


moments
 in
 modern
 American
 history.


>> Mhm.


>> Trump
 has
 just
 executed
 his
 most


audacious
 overseas
 intervention.


I've
 been
 talking
 to
 him
 for
 a
 couple
 of


weeks
 about
 sitting
 down
 for
 a
 full
 on


thereord
 New
 York
 Times
 interview.
 As


you
 know,
 the
 relationship
 between


President
 Trump
 and
 the
 New
 York
 Times


has
 been
 occasionally
 slightly
 fraught.


>> Yeah.
 And
 latigious.


>> And
 latigious.


>> He
 sued
 us
 over
 the
 past
 few
 months


>> only
 for
 $15
 billion.
 But
 in
 the
 end,
 he


very
 happily
 agreed
 to
 it.
 And
 we
 were


told
 that
 the
 moment
 would
 be
 5:00
 p.m.


on
 Wednesday
 night.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 we
 actually
 thought
 that
 was
 a
 good


piece
 of
 timing
 cuz
 we
 figured
 we
 would


probably
 be
 his
 last
 appointment
 of
 the


day.
 Right.


>> And
 anybody
 who
 has
 dealt
 with
 Donald


Trump,
 and
 I've
 dealt
 with
 him
 for
 a
 few


years,
 knows
 that
 if
 you're
 the
 last


appointment
 of
 the
 day,
 you're
 likely
 to


be
 sticking
 around
 for
 a
 while.


>> Mhm.


>> We
 didn't
 leave
 the
 White
 House
 till


after
 9:00
 p.m.


>> Right.
 You
 got
 a
 meaningful
 chunk
 of
 his


time.


>> We
 did.
 Interrupted
 some
 by
 a
 few
 side


moments,
 including
 the
 president
 wanting


to
 show
 us
 some
 of
 his
 architectural


plans
 and
 visit
 what
 he's
 done
 up
 in
 the


residence
 and
 so
 forth.
 But
 a
 good
 oh


just
 shy
 of
 two
 hours
 of
 it
 was
 an


actual
 deep
 probing
 conversation
 about


this
 past
 year,
 foreign
 and
 domestic


issues.
 And
 our
 goal,
 Michael,
 was
 to


try
 to
 do
 something
 deeper
 and
 hopefully


more
 revealing


than
 what
 the
 president
 does
 every
 day


when
 he
 stands
 up
 briefly
 in
 front
 of


reporters
 on
 Air
 Force
 One
 or
 does
 a


gaggle,
 as
 they
 call
 it,
 around
 the


Resolute
 Desk.
 And
 readers
 and
 listeners


are
 going
 to
 have
 to
 determine
 if
 you


succeeded.


>> Yeah.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 to
 that
 point,
 walk
 us


through
 the
 interview.


Sit
 down,
 please.


>> So,
 we
 settled
 in,
 sat
 down,
 arrayed


around
 the
 Resolute
 desk.
 It
 was
 me
 and


Tyler
 Pager,
 Zolan
 Cano
 Young's,
 and


Katie
 Rogers.


>> Mhm.


>> Marco,
 why
 don't
 you
 join
 us
 for
 a


couple
 of
 minutes?
 Is
 that
 okay?


>> Already
 inside
 the
 Oval
 Office
 was


Secretary
 of
 State
 Marco
 Rubio.
 We
 were


about
 to
 learn
 why.
 And
 right
 away,


Michael,
 we
 had
 to
 sort
 through
 a
 few


logistics.
 So
 we
 have
 an
 understand
 this


is
 only
 used
 for
 your
 reporting.


>> So
 this
 is
 what
 we
 wanted
 to
 ask
 you


about.
 I
 think
 in
 two
 different


interviews
 in
 the
 first
 term
 we
 used
 the


audio
 to
 go
 on
 the
 daily
 and
 the
 first


thing
 we
 had
 to
 go
 do
 was
 negotiate
 that


we
 could
 actually
 use
 this
 recording
 for


the
 daily.


>> Right.
 Thank
 you.
 Because
 without
 that


negotiation
 we
 don't
 have
 this
 episode.


>> Anything
 for
 the
 daily.
 Michael,


>> let's
 leave
 it
 for
 a
 little
 while.
 Fine.


For
 a
 little
 while.
 We'll
 see
 how
 it


goes.
 And
 we
 were
 just
 a
 few
 minutes


into
 the
 conversation.


>> Is
 he
 on
 the
 phone?
 So,
 can
 you
 turn


that
 off
 for
 a
 second?


>> When
 an
 aid
 came
 in
 and
 handed
 the


president
 a
 note.


>> He's
 about
 to
 have
 a
 a
 call
 with


President
 Petro.
 And
 this
 call
 is
 off


the
 record.


>> Okay.
 Saying
 the
 president
 of
 Colombia


was
 on
 the
 phone,
 the
 country,
 not
 the


university.


>> That's
 right.


>> Can
 you
 turn
 them
 off?
 You
 give
 me
 a


word.


>> Yeah.
 Off.
 And
 what
 did
 that
 mean
 to
 you


knowing
 that
 the
 president
 of
 Colombia


was
 calling
 him
 in
 this
 moment?


>> The
 first
 thing
 that
 came
 to
 mind
 was,


"Oh,
 we
 have
 to
 get
 up
 and
 walk
 out."


But
 just
 as
 I
 was
 getting
 up
 to
 go
 do


that,
 the
 president
 waved
 at
 me
 just


like,
 "No,
 David,
 please
 stay."
 Right?


And
 the
 second
 thing
 that
 I
 thought
 was


if
 the
 president
 of
 Colombia
 is
 calling,


it's
 because
 he's
 worried
 about
 the
 fact


that
 President
 Trump
 said
 just
 the
 other


day
 he
 better
 watch
 his
 ass
 because
 he


could
 be
 next.


>> After
 Nicholas
 Maduro's
 ouster,
 he
 could


be
 next
 to
 be
 ousted.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 at
 just
 that
 moment,


JD
 Vance
 came
 in
 and
 settled
 in
 next
 to


Marco
 Rubio
 to
 listen
 to
 the


conversation.


>> Got
 it.
 Now,
 the
 conversation
 itself
 was


off
 the
 record,
 but
 it
 turned
 out
 that


some
 of
 our
 colleagues
 down
 in
 Colombia


had
 just
 sat
 down
 with
 President
 Pro.


So,
 we
 had
 New
 York
 Times
 reporters
 at


both
 ends
 of
 this
 conversation.
 They
 had


left
 before
 the
 call
 happened,
 but
 Petro


was
 very
 clear
 with
 them.
 He
 said,
 "This


is
 a
 scary
 moment
 for
 Colombia.
 This
 is


Donald
 Trump.
 We
 could
 well
 get
 the


Venezuela
 treatment."


>> So,
 presumably,
 he's
 calling
 to
 beseech


President
 Trump
 to
 treat
 him
 kindly.


>> That's
 exactly
 right.


>> Got
 it.


>> So,
 the
 call
 ends.


>> Okay,
 let's
 go.


>> We
 turn
 our
 recorders
 back
 on.


>> I
 hope
 that
 was
 interesting.
 Was
 that


interesting
 to
 you?


>> Very
 interesting.
 And
 that
 began
 a


really
 wide-ranging
 conversation.
 And
 in


the
 first
 part,
 not
 surprisingly,
 we


spent
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 on
 foreign
 policy.


>> Great.
 So,
 let
 me
 tell
 you
 where
 we
 want


to
 start.
 Um,
 your
 decision
 to
 capture


Maduro
 and
 declare
 that
 the
 US
 was
 in


charge
 for
 the
 foreseeable
 future,
 I


think,
 raised
 a
 question
 of
 whether
 you


believe,
 as
 your
 aid,
 Steven
 Miller,
 put


it
 so
 clearly
 the
 other
 night,
 that


international
 nicities
 are
 gone.
 That


countries
 operate
 by
 strength.
 He
 I


think
 he
 said,
 "Govern
 by
 strength,


government
 by
 force,
 governed
 by
 power."


And
 I
 think
 that
 left
 a
 lot
 of
 people


wondering
 whether
 you
 believe
 you
 have


the
 right
 as
 the
 world's
 largest


superpower
 to
 go
 in
 and
 extinguish
 any


threat
 or
 seize
 any
 resource
 you
 think


is
 in
 the
 US
 interest
 particularly
 in


the
 Western
 Hemisphere.
 If
 there's
 a


threat,
 you
 use
 the
 word
 threat,
 you


certainly
 would
 have
 the
 right,
 any


country
 would
 have
 the
 right
 to
 do
 that.


Uh
 without
 the
 threat,
 much
 less
 so.
 And


frankly,
 I
 do
 believe
 in
 the
 nicities.
 I


get
 along
 with
 a
 lot
 of
 people.
 I
 get


along
 with


>> for
 most
 presidents,
 military
 power
 is


the
 very
 last
 resort
 after
 everything


else,
 every
 form
 of
 diplomacy


has
 failed
 you.


So,
 I
 wanted
 to
 get
 the
 president


focused
 on
 the
 question
 of
 what
 criteria


he
 uses
 to
 exercise
 the
 most
 extreme
 and


deadly
 form
 of
 American
 power,
 which
 is


the
 military.


but
 also
 try
 to
 figure
 out
 how
 much
 of
 a


motivation
 in
 Venezuela
 was
 the
 fact


that
 it's
 sitting
 on
 the
 world's
 largest


reserves
 of
 oil.
 You've
 gone
 in
 in
 part


to
 get
 a
 resource
 which
 you
 just


declared
 today.


>> Well,
 I
 got
 in
 I
 I
 got
 in
 for
 numerous


reasons.
 Number
 one,
 the
 drugs
 are


pouring
 into
 the
 country.
 You
 know
 that.


Number
 two,
 the
 people
 are
 pouring
 into


the
 country
 were.
 except
 now
 we
 have
 a


100%
 strong
 border.


>> That
 all
 this
 talk
 about
 a
 threat
 from


drugs,
 from
 criminals
 and
 all
 that
 might


be
 secondary
 to
 his
 true
 motivation


here.


>> No,
 the
 oil
 happened
 to
 be
 there.


>> Don't
 forget
 the
 oil
 will
 take
 a
 while,


but
 we
 have
 it
 set.
 Although
 we
 did
 get,


you
 know,
 many
 barrels
 of
 oil
 today
 as


you
 probably
 know.


>> Uh
 and
 uh
 that's
 fine,
 but
 we
 didn't
 do


that.
 We
 didn't
 even
 know
 about
 the
 all


of
 the
 oil
 that
 was
 being
 stored
 there.


>> So
 supposing
 you're
 Xi
 Jinping
 and


you've
 watched
 the
 events
 of
 the
 past


>> few
 days.


>> And
 I
 wanted
 him
 to
 talk
 a
 little
 bit


about
 the
 long-term
 implications
 of


this,
 the
 precedent
 it
 sets.
 You
 may


also
 be
 thinking
 that
 if
 you're
 Xi
 that


you
 could
 use
 the
 same
 logic
 to


decapitate
 and
 control
 Taiwan
 or
 why


couldn't
 Putin
 use
 that
 argument,
 same


argument,
 it's
 a
 threat
 to
 grab
 the
 rest


of
 Ukraine
 or
 go
 beyond
 into
 other


former
 Soviet
 states.
 In other
 words,


have
 you
 created
 a
 precedent
 that
 you


may
 come
 to
 regret
 later
 on?


>> No,
 because
 this
 is
 this
 was
 a
 real


threat.
 You
 didn't
 have
 people
 pouring


into
 China.
 You
 didn't
 have
 drugs


pouring
 into
 China.
 You
 didn't
 have
 all


of
 the


>> that
 what
 happens
 if
 you're
 Xi
 Jinping


and
 you're
 watching
 this
 thinking,
 boy,


this
 is
 useful
 when
 I'm
 justifying
 going


after
 Taiwan.


>> The
 president
 engaged
 on
 this,
 but
 I'm


not
 sure
 he'd
 given
 it
 a
 huge
 amount
 of


thought
 before
 we
 started
 discussing
 it.


>> And
 uh
 that's
 up
 to
 him
 what
 he's
 going


to
 be
 doing,
 but
 you
 know,
 I've


expressed
 to
 him
 that
 I
 would
 be
 very


unhappy
 if
 he
 did
 that.


And
 at
 some
 point,
 Tyler
 Pager
 jumped


back
 in
 to
 bring
 the
 topic
 back
 to
 the


central
 question
 of
 Venezuela.


>> How
 long
 do
 you
 think
 you'll
 be
 running


Venezuela?


>> Only
 time
 will
 tell.


>> Like
 3
 months,
 6
 months,
 a
 year
 longer.


>> I
 would
 say
 much
 longer
 than
 that.


>> Much
 longer.
 And
 we
 have
 to
 rebuild.


>> You
 have
 to
 rebuild
 the
 country.
 And
 we


will
 rebuild
 it
 in
 a
 very
 profitable


way.


>> We're
 going
 to
 be
 uh
 using
 oil
 and
 we're


going
 to
 be
 taking
 oil.
 We're
 getting


oil
 prices
 down
 and
 we're
 going
 to
 be


giving
 u
 money
 to
 Venezuela
 which
 they


desperately
 need.
 We're
 going
 to
 be


helping.


>> One
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we
 all
 really


wanted
 to
 know
 was
 what
 would
 it
 take


for
 the
 president
 to
 actually
 send


American
 forces
 back
 on
 the
 ground
 in


Venezuela?


>> On
 the
 importance
 of
 the
 military,
 what


would
 trigger
 a
 decision
 to
 send
 ground


troops
 into
 Venezuela?


Uh,
 I
 wouldn't
 want
 to
 tell
 you
 that


because,
 you
 know,
 I
 can't
 I
 can't
 give


up
 information
 like
 that
 to
 a
 reporter


as
 good
 as
 you
 may
 be.
 I
 just
 can't
 talk


about
 that.
 There's
 a
 possibility
 I


would
 do
 that.
 Absolutely.
 you
 know,
 a


second


>> because
 the
 US
 has
 really
 never
 tried
 an


experiment
 like
 the
 one
 that
 we're


seeing
 play
 out
 now,
 which
 is
 a
 kind
 of


virtual
 or
 remote
 control
 occupation,


>> right?


>> Running
 a
 foreign
 country
 kind
 of
 by


phone


>> or
 by
 having
 an
 armada
 floating
 just


offshore.


>> Would
 you
 do
 it
 if
 you
 couldn't
 get
 at


the
 oil?
 Would
 you
 do
 it
 if
 they
 didn't


kick
 out
 the
 Chinese
 and
 Russian?


>> I
 can't
 tell
 you
 that.
 Uh
 I
 really


wouldn't
 want
 to
 tell
 you
 that,
 but


they're
 treating
 us
 with
 great
 respect.


As
 you
 know,
 we're
 getting
 along
 very


well
 with
 the
 administration
 that
 is


there
 right
 now.
 Uh
 they're
 giving
 us


everything
 that
 we
 feel
 is
 necessary.


>> But
 President
 Trump
 insisted
 to
 us
 that


right
 now
 he's
 getting
 from
 the


Venezuelan
 government,
 which
 is


essentially
 all
 filled
 with
 Maduro's


appointees.


Everything
 that
 he
 wants,
 and
 most
 of


what
 he
 wants
 is
 access
 to
 the
 oil.


Given
 what
 has
 happened
 in
 Venezuela,


the
 threats
 against
 Colombia,
 the


discussions
 about
 taking
 Greenland,


buying
 Greenland,
 however
 you're
 framing


this
 right
 now,
 is
 there
 anything
 that


you
 think
 can
 constrain
 your
 power
 on


the
 world
 stage
 if
 you
 believe
 that


something
 is
 against
 national
 security?


Do
 you
 see
 any
 checks
 on
 your
 power
 on


the
 world
 stage?
 Is
 there
 anything
 that


could
 stop
 you
 if
 you
 wanted
 to?


>> Yeah,
 there's
 one
 thing.
 My
 own


morality,


my
 own
 mind.
 That's
 the
 only
 thing
 that


can
 stop
 international
 law.
 And
 that's


very
 good.


>> I
 don't
 need
 international
 law.
 I'm
 not


looking
 to
 hurt
 people.
 I'm
 not
 looking


to
 kill
 people.
 I've
 ended,
 remember


this,
 I've
 ended
 eight
 wars.
 Nobody
 else


has
 ever
 done
 that.
 I've
 ended
 eight


wars
 and
 didn't
 get
 the
 Nobel
 Peace


Prize.
 Pretty
 amazing.
 Obama
 got
 it.
 He


was
 there
 for
 a
 few
 weeks
 and
 he
 got
 it.


He
 didn't
 even
 know
 why
 he
 got
 it.
 They


they
 asked
 him
 why
 did
 he
 get
 it.
 He
 was


unable
 to
 answer
 the
 question.
 I
 ended


eight
 wars.
 I
 if
 you
 look
 at
 those
 wars,


these
 were
 tough
 wars
 to
 end
 too.
 And


let
 me
 tell
 you,
 India
 and
 Pakistan
 were


going
 at
 it
 as
 you
 know,
 they
 were
 going


at
 it.
 But
 but
 that
 was
 one
 of
 eight,


but
 we
 ended
 eight
 strong
 wars,
 some


going
 on
 for
 more
 than
 30
 years.


>> But
 do
 you
 feel
 your
 administration


needs
 to
 abide
 by
 international
 law
 on


the
 global
 stage?


>> Yeah,
 I
 I
 do.
 I
 you
 know,
 I
 do.
 But
 it


it
 depends
 what
 your
 definition
 of


international
 law
 is.
 But
 the
 answer
 is


I
 do.
 But
 we
 have
 to
 keep
 the
 United


States
 safe.
 We
 have
 to
 keep
 parts
 of


the
 world
 safe
 that
 we
 feel
 responsible


for.
 NATO
 is
 not
 feared
 by
 Russia
 or


China
 at
 all.
 Not
 even
 a
 little
 bit.


We're
 tremendously.
 David,
 I
 found
 this


exchange
 that
 the
 president
 had
 with


Katie
 Rogers
 really
 fascinating
 because


he
 is
 saying
 that
 at
 a
 moment
 when
 he
 is


exercising
 power
 arguably
 as
 never


before


that
 international
 law
 is
 not
 much
 of
 a


constraint
 on
 him.
 The
 only
 constraint


really
 is
 his
 personal
 judgment.
 And
 he


goes
 on
 to
 say
 that
 he
 thinks
 that


situation,
 him
 exercising
 American
 power


kind
 of
 at
 his
 whim
 is
 what
 instills
 in


our
 foes
 and
 even
 in
 our
 allies
 like


NATO
 the
 respect
 and
 fear
 required
 to


operate
 in
 this
 world.
 I
 think
 this
 is


one
 of
 the
 most
 fascinating
 windows
 into


the
 way
 President
 Trump
 thinks
 because


as
 you
 just
 heard
 there,
 he
 views
 the


only
 check
 on
 his
 power
 to
 be
 his
 own


moral
 compass.


>> Mhm.


>> And
 that
 outside
 institutions,
 whether


they're
 the
 UN
 or
 an
 international


treaty,


>> only
 means
 what
 he
 interprets
 it
 to


mean.
 Mhm.


>> And
 that
 tells
 you
 that
 he
 wants
 to


operate
 as
 a
 leader
 with
 fundamentally


no
 check
 at
 all
 because
 he
 thinks
 he's
 a


good
 person
 and
 therefore
 the
 world
 can


rely
 on


>> his
 good
 judgments,


>> his
 good
 judgment
 and
 his
 good
 heart.


>> And
 so
 we
 thought
 we'd
 sort
 of
 stress


test
 that
 by
 turning
 to
 Greenland.


>> Can
 I
 circle
 back
 to
 what
 you
 had
 said


about
 NATO?
 If
 you
 had
 to
 choose
 between


obtaining
 Greenland
 and
 preserving
 NATO,


what's
 your
 higher
 priority
 there?


>> Well,
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 say
 that
 to
 you,


but
 it
 may
 be
 a
 choice.
 You
 have
 to


understand
 Russia
 is
 not
 at
 all


concerned
 with
 NATO
 other
 than
 us.
 China


is
 not
 at
 all
 concerned
 with
 NATO
 other


than
 us
 because
 sadly,
 you
 know,
 Europe


is
 becoming
 a
 much
 different
 place.
 And


they
 really
 do
 have
 to
 shape
 up.
 I
 want


them
 to
 shape
 up.
 I
 think
 we'll
 always


get
 along
 with
 Europe.
 But


>> what
 he's
 essentially
 saying
 is
 the
 US


holds
 all
 the
 cards,
 has
 all
 the
 power,


and
 NATO's
 not
 going
 to
 have
 a
 choice


because
 there
 is
 no
 NATO
 without
 the


United
 States.
 And
 therefore,
 if
 the


price
 of
 keeping
 the
 alliance
 together


>> is
 handing
 the
 US
 the
 right
 to
 control


Greenland,
 they're
 going
 to
 do
 it


because
 they
 don't
 have
 another
 choice.


Are
 you
 prepared
 to
 send
 troops
 to


Greenland
 if
 they
 do
 not
 give
 over
 the


territory?


>> Well,
 we
 already
 have
 troops
 in


>> more
 troops
 to
 militarily
 take
 over.


>> I
 mean,
 we
 take
 over.
 We
 have,
 you
 know,


good
 section
 of
 troops
 and
 I've
 had


troops
 there
 and
 and
 I've,
 you
 know,


upped
 it.


>> I
 was
 there
 this
 summer
 and
 you
 could


send
 as
 many
 troops
 as
 you
 want.
 And
 you


haven't
 done
 it.
 How
 come?


>> Because
 I
 want
 to
 do
 it
 properly.


>> And
 properly
 means
 own
 it.
 really
 it
 is


to
 me
 it's
 ownership.
 Ownership
 is
 very


important.
 You
 know


>> why
 is
 ownership
 important
 here?


>> Because
 that's
 what
 I
 feel
 is


psychologically
 needed
 for
 success.
 I


think
 that
 ownership
 gives
 you
 a
 thing


that
 you
 can't
 do
 whether
 you're
 talking


about
 a
 lease
 or
 a
 treaty.
 Uh
 ownership


gives
 you
 things
 and
 elements
 that
 you


can't
 get
 from
 just
 signing
 a
 document


that
 you
 can
 have
 a
 important
 to
 you
 or


to


>> psychologically
 important
 for
 me.
 Now,


maybe
 another
 president
 would
 feel


differently,
 but
 so
 far
 I've
 been
 right


about
 everything.


>> And
 you
 would
 use
 military
 force
 to
 get


that.


>> I
 didn't
 say
 that.
 You
 said
 that.


>> I'm
 asking
 you,
 would
 you?


>> Yeah.
 I
 wouldn't
 comment
 on
 that.
 It's
 I


don't
 think
 it'll
 be
 necessary.


>> And
 can
 you
 just
 explain
 what
 he
 means


by
 that?
 The
 psychological


value
 of
 owning
 Greenland,
 not
 just


controlling
 it,
 not
 just
 having
 a
 lot
 of


influence
 over
 it,
 but
 owning
 it.
 The


way
 I
 read
 it
 was,
 "Hey,
 I
 spent
 my
 life


as
 a
 real
 estate
 developer
 and
 I
 know


that
 you
 have
 way
 more
 control
 if
 you


own
 than
 if
 you
 lease."


>> But
 that
 also
 means
 I
 fundamentally


don't
 believe
 in
 relying
 on
 alliances.


and
 the
 fact
 that
 Denmark,
 a
 member
 of


NATO,


>> a
 member
 of
 NATO,
 which
 basically


controls
 and
 protects
 Greenland,
 it's


not
 enough
 for
 him
 to
 have
 an
 ally


that
 he's
 got
 to
 do
 it
 himself.
 Now,
 you


got
 to
 ask
 yourself,
 where
 does
 that


logic
 end,


>> right?
 Does
 it
 end
 with
 China
 taking


over
 Taiwan?
 Does
 it
 end
 with
 Russia


taking
 over
 Ukraine?


>> Does
 it
 end
 with
 the
 United
 States


demanding
 that
 doesn't
 stop
 at


Greenland?
 Maybe
 we
 need
 Iceland
 as


well.
 So
 David,
 based
 on
 how
 the


president
 talked
 about
 the
 use
 of


American
 power
 overseas
 and
 especially


the
 use
 of
 American
 military
 power


overseas,


what
 were
 you
 left
 thinking
 by
 the
 end


of
 this
 part
 of
 the
 interview?
 I
 was


left
 thinking
 that
 the
 president
 feels


himself
 unconstrained
 by
 law,


convention,
 or
 the
 systems
 that
 the


United
 States
 itself
 built
 at
 the
 end
 of


World
 War
 II
 after
 the
 world
 had
 gone


through
 two
 horrific


>> NATO
 and
 the
 entire
 system
 of


international
 law.


>> That's
 right.
 But
 at
 the
 same
 time
 that


he's
 not
 a
 wararmonger,
 right?
 He


actually
 does
 want
 that
 peace
 prize.
 He


does
 want
 to
 be
 known
 as
 a
 president
 of


peace.
 And
 yet
 when
 he's
 given
 the


choice
 between
 long,
 slow,
 boring


diplomacy
 and
 quick
 action
 by
 special


operations
 breaking
 down
 doors,


he'll
 go
 for
 the
 special
 operators.


>> What
 you're
 describing
 is
 a
 set
 of


extraordinary
 contradictions
 even
 for


Donald
 Trump.


>> Absolutely.
 And
 that
 is
 what
 is
 both


maddening
 and
 fascinating


about
 covering
 the
 Trump
 presidency


because
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 fit
 this
 man


into
 some
 simple
 set
 of
 theories.
 He
 is


a
 bundle
 of
 contradictions.


Well,
 David,
 after
 the
 break,
 we
 are


going
 to
 turn
 to
 a
 similar
 bundle
 of


contradictions
 when
 it
 comes
 to
 domestic


affairs.
 We'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


on
 behalf
 of
 both
 of
 them.
 Have
 they
 got


us?


>> I
 want
 to
 make
 sure
 we
 have
 time
 for


domestic
 policy
 too.
 Um
 uh
 ICE
 did
 shoot


and
 kill
 an
 American
 citizen
 today


according
 to
 early
 reports.


>> David,
 tell
 us
 about
 the
 conversation


that
 the
 four
 of
 you
 had
 with
 the


president
 about
 domestic
 issues.
 Well,


Zolan
 kicked
 it
 off
 with
 questions
 about


this
 horrifying
 scene
 we
 had
 all
 just


seen
 play
 out
 in
 Minneapolis
 just
 hours


before.


>> Uh
 we
 have
 also
 seen
 protesters
 met
 with


violent
 tactics
 and
 pepper
 spray.
 In


some
 cases,
 American
 citizens
 have
 also


been
 wrongfully
 detained.
 Do
 any
 of


these
 incidents
 or
 tactics
 make
 you


think
 ICE
 has
 gone
 too
 far?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 that
 ISIS
 has
 been
 treated


very
 badly.
 Don't
 forget,
 I
 got
 rid
 of


thousands
 and
 thousands
 of
 killers,


murderers.
 They've
 gotten
 rid
 of


thousands
 of
 people
 that
 were
 led
 into


our
 country
 during
 the
 Biden


administration
 so
 stupidly.
 Uh
 they're


very
 they're
 very
 brave,
 very
 citizen


was
 shot
 today.


>> That's
 right.


>> Does
 this
 make
 you
 uncomfortable?


>> Well,
 I
 Everything
 makes
 me


uncomfortable.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 nobody
 get


shot.
 I
 want
 to
 see
 nobody
 screaming
 and


trying
 to
 run
 over
 policemen
 either
 or,


you
 know,
 law
 enforceed
 by
 local


officials
 in
 the


>> Well,
 if
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at
 the
 tape,
 I


saw
 the
 same
 tape
 that
 you
 must
 have


seen.
 I
 just
 saw
 it.
 There
 were
 several


>> there
 were
 several
 angles
 on
 that.


>> Well,
 I
 know.
 But
 if
 you
 take
 a
 look
 at


that,
 that
 was
 a
 vicious
 situation
 that


took
 place.
 And
 if
 you
 go
 before
 that,


and
 in
 my
 opinion,
 the
 the
 screamer,


that
 woman
 that
 was
 screaming
 shame,


shame,
 shame,
 that's
 not
 normal.
 That


was
 a
 practiced,
 rehearsed,
 professional


agitator.


>> Even
 so,
 are
 those
 appropriate
 policing


tactics
 for
 somebody
 to
 fire
 into
 a


vehicle
 like
 that
 in
 your
 mind?
 Is
 that


>> Well,
 they
 ran
 him
 over.
 I
 mean,
 they


ran


>> and
 Trump
 just
 sort
 of
 reflexively


defended
 the
 officers
 and
 claimed
 that


the
 driver
 had
 run
 over
 one
 of
 them


>> and
 we
 had
 all
 seen
 this
 video
 and


immediately
 sort
 of
 stepped
 in
 to


challenge
 the
 account


>> tried
 to
 run.


>> Video
 didn't
 look
 like
 he
 was
 he
 was
 run


over.


>> Well,
 I'd
 play
 the
 tape
 for
 you
 right


now.
 Do
 you
 want
 to
 just
 whip
 it
 out?


Looked
 to
 me
 to
 be
 very
 bad.
 I
 I
 just


put
 out
 the
 tape.
 And
 so
 Trump
 said,


>> "Well,
 let's
 just
 watch
 it
 together."


>> And
 to
 our
 surprise,
 that's
 exactly
 what


happened.


>> Have
 any
 of
 these
 have
 any
 of
 these


tactics
 made
 you
 uncomfortable?
 You


know,
 you've
 had
 citizens
 that
 have
 also


been
 wrongfully
 detained
 here?


>> Yeah,
 we've
 seen
 that
 one.


>> We've
 seen
 that
 video.


>> Yeah.


>> One
 of
 his
 aids
 brought
 over
 a
 laptop,


slowed
 down
 a
 a
 version
 of
 the
 tape.


>> Does
 not
 look
 like
 the
 ICE
 officer
 has


been
 run
 over
 there.
 And
 then
 maybe
 from


a
 different
 angle
 we
 would
 see.


>> The
 way
 I
 look
 at
 it.


>> Oh,
 sure.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 that,


[Music]


>> it's
 terrible
 scene.


>> Yeah,
 we
 all
 agree
 on.


>> You
 say
 it's
 horrible
 to
 watch.
 You
 said


that
 on
 truth.
 So,
 do
 you
 think
 that


goes
 I
 hate
 to
 see
 it.
 It
 was
 sort
 of
 a


strange
 form
 of
 real
 time
 factchecking


of
 the
 president
 with
 it
 clear
 that
 the


president
 wasn't
 entirely
 comfortable


with
 what
 he
 was
 seeing
 on
 that
 laptop.


>> Mhm.


>> Or
 what
 these
 ICE
 agents
 were
 doing.


>> So
 just
 take
 a
 step
 back
 here
 because


this


>> and
 then
 from
 there
 the
 president
 sort


of
 turn
 to
 a
 a
 different
 topic
 about


what
 the
 real
 aim
 of
 the
 president's


immigration
 restrictions
 are
 and
 who


they're
 supposed
 to
 target.
 challenge,


but
 I
 do.


>> Your
 administration
 has
 also
 suggested


that
 some
 people
 who
 are
 naturalized


citizens
 could
 see
 their
 citizenship


strict.
 Uh,
 which
 groups
 do
 you
 think


should
 lose
 citizenship?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 Somalia
 is
 a
 disaster
 to


be
 honest
 with
 you.
 I
 look
 at
 what's


happening
 in
 Minnesota
 and
 you
 look
 at


this
 country,
 it's
 one
 of
 the
 worst
 in


the
 world.
 It's
 acknowledged
 to
 be
 truly


one
 of
 the
 most
 corrupt,
 one
 of
 the
 most


vicious,
 violent
 countries
 in
 the
 world.


Uh,
 even
 the
 ships,
 they
 go
 after
 the


ships.
 They
 don't
 do
 that
 anymore


because
 if
 they
 go
 after
 the
 ships,
 you


know
 what?
 They
 get
 hit
 by
 the
 same


missile
 that
 we
 hit
 the
 drug
 dealers.


>> Question
 is,
 would
 you
 strip
 them
 of


their
 nationality?


>> If
 they
 deserve
 to
 be
 stripped,
 I
 would.


Yeah.


>> So,
 what
 would
 the
 criteria
 you
 would


>> Well,
 we're
 looking
 at
 criteria
 right


now.
 But
 if
 they
 deserve
 to
 be
 stripped,


David,
 I'd
 do
 it
 in
 a
 heartbeat.
 Yeah.


>> You
 don't
 think
 that
 your
 comments
 about


those
 of
 Somali
 descent
 have
 painted
 a


broad
 brush
 on
 your
 own
 citizens?


>> I
 don't
 care.
 I
 want
 great
 people
 in


this
 country.
 I
 want
 people
 that
 love


the
 country.
 And
 I
 think
 that
 many
 of


the
 people
 that
 came
 in
 from
 Somalia


uh
 they
 hate
 our
 country.
 They
 came
 and


they
 and
 not
 only
 do
 they
 hate
 our


country,
 they've
 ripped
 off
 our
 country.


They've
 ripped
 it
 off.
 They've
 stolen


billions
 of
 dollars.
 It's
 shocking
 from


where
 they
 came,
 they
 had
 nothing.
 And


they
 come
 here
 and
 they
 steal.
 And
 it's


an
 embarrassment
 to
 the
 intelligence
 of


the
 people
 of
 Minnesota
 and
 to
 the


people
 of
 our
 country


>> in
 your
 view


>> that
 that
 they
 would
 be
 allowed
 to
 do


it.
 I
 I
 I've
 heard
 many
 people
 that
 say


this
 is
 generalizing
 in
 population
 and


find
 these
 comments.


>> You
 call
 it
 whatever
 you
 want.


>> I
 want
 to
 ask
 if
 part
 of
 your


immigration
 agenda
 is
 also
 aimed
 at


changing
 the
 racial
 makeup
 of
 this


country.


>> No,
 not
 at
 all.


>> Is
 part
 of
 this
 this
 agenda
 aimed
 at


>> I
 just
 want
 people
 that
 love
 our


country.
 It's
 very
 simple.
 I
 want
 people


that
 love
 our
 country.
 I
 want
 people


that
 respect
 our
 country,
 respect
 the


laws
 of
 our
 country.
 And
 uh
 I
 want


people
 that
 can
 embrace
 our
 country


>> because
 you've
 you've
 support
 all


refugees


>> that
 can
 make
 America
 great
 again.


>> You
 have
 a
 tra
 on
 the
 majority
 African.


>> And
 Zolan
 raises
 an
 interesting
 point.


The
 the
 only
 immigrants
 who
 can
 come
 in


right
 now
 are
 white
 South
 Africans,


right?


>> Refugees


>> the
 way
 of
 refugees.


>> Well,
 I
 haven't
 seen
 that.
 I
 mean,
 I


certainly
 haven't
 seen
 that.
 But
 over


the
 years,
 it's
 been
 very
 much
 the


opposite
 of
 that.
 Very,
 very
 much
 the


opposite
 of
 that.
 Uh
 people
 are
 coming


into
 our
 country.
 Nobody's
 doing
 it


based
 on
 race.


>> Trump
 is
 positing
 to
 you
 all
 that
 his


immigration
 restrictions
 are
 not
 about


race.
 They're
 not
 intentionally
 about


race
 when
 the
 reality
 is
 that
 they
 are


allowing
 for
 very
 few
 people
 of
 color
 to


enter
 the
 country.
 The
 people
 who
 are


banned


>> from
 entering
 the
 US
 right
 now
 and
 there


are
 bans
 on
 a
 lot
 of
 countries.
 They
 are


almost
 uniformly
 from
 countries
 where


the
 populations
 are
 black
 and
 brown.
 The


very
 few
 people
 he
 is
 letting
 in
 are


white.
 The
 pattern
 becomes
 difficult
 to


ignore.
 It
 sure
 does.
 And
 look,
 he
 says


he
 just
 wants
 people
 who
 love
 this


country
 to
 be
 allowed
 in.
 But
 what
 we're


learning
 is
 he
 basically
 only
 wants
 to


favor
 white
 South
 Africans
 as
 I
 raised


with
 him
 or
 the
 immigrants
 he
 wants
 the


most
 are
 those
 who
 bring
 special
 skills


that
 can
 help
 our
 economy
 and
 uh
 that's


a
 a
 very
 select
 group.


>> Do
 you
 think
 some
 industries
 still
 need


immigrant
 labor?


>> Yes.


>> Which
 ones?


>> They
 need
 inexpensive
 Well,
 they're


different
 things.
 We
 need
 people
 to
 come


in.
 Just
 so
 you
 understand
 something,


I'm
 all
 for
 people
 coming
 into
 our


country
 through
 the
 border
 legally.
 If


they
 come
 in
 legally,
 I
 want
 them
 more


than
 they
 want
 me
 and
 more
 than
 they


want
 this
 country.
 And
 if
 you
 look
 at
 my


first
 term
 and
 if
 you
 look
 at
 this
 term,


I
 want
 we
 need
 people.
 We're
 building


factories
 all
 over
 the
 country
 who
 are


building.
 You
 said,


>> but
 I
 want
 them
 to
 come
 in
 to
 be


protected
 respectfully.
 I
 want
 them
 to


come
 in
 legally.
 But
 you
 said


agriculture
 and
 hotels
 uh
 that
 you


wanted
 ICE
 to
 use
 common
 sense
 against


them,
 right?
 I
 want
 them
 to
 use


>> Have
 you
 directed
 ICE
 to
 ease


deportations
 against
 those
 industries?


Yes.
 Are
 there
 other
 industries
 that


you've
 directed
 ICE?


>> Because
 I
 watch
 farmers
 and
 I
 deal
 with


farmers
 and
 I
 want
 90%
 of
 the
 farmers,


more
 than
 that,
 and
 they're
 great


people.
 And
 they
 have
 great
 people


working
 for
 them
 who
 have
 been
 working


for
 them
 for
 25
 years.
 They're
 almost


like
 a
 member
 of
 the
 family.


>> Are
 there
 other
 in
 those
 people
 thrown


out
 of
 the
 country?
 Are
 there
 other


industries
 or
 companies
 that
 you've


directed
 ICE
 to
 ease
 deportations
 on?


>> No,
 the
 South
 Korean
 case


>> some
 some
 service
 industries
 uh
 some


I'll
 give
 you
 an
 example
 in
 Georgia
 with


South
 Korea.


>> They
 make
 batteries.
 Batteries
 are
 very


complex
 and
 they're
 very
 dangerous
 to


make
 and
 they
 make
 them
 and
 they
 brought


in
 three
 or
 4
 hundred
 people
 who


specialize
 in


>> them
 all


>> and
 they
 throw
 them
 out.
 And
 I
 was
 very


angry
 about
 it.
 You
 know
 why?
 because


they
 have
 to
 open
 a
 factory
 and
 you


can't
 take
 a
 person
 off
 the
 street
 who's


never
 seen
 a
 battery
 before
 and
 think


that
 they're
 going
 to
 make
 highly


complex
 batteries.


>> He
 actually
 invoked
 the
 ICE
 raid
 on
 that


Kyai
 plant
 in
 Georgia
 where
 they


deported
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 South
 Korean


workers
 who
 were
 there
 setting
 up
 a
 a


car
 battery
 factory.


>> You
 have
 to
 allow
 them
 to
 bring
 some
 of


their
 experts
 with
 them
 or
 they're
 never


going
 to
 be
 able
 to
 open
 their
 plant.
 It


sounds
 like
 you
 were
 angry
 at
 at
 ICE
 for


this
 raid
 on
 the
 Hyundai
 facility.


>> I
 was
 not
 happy
 about
 it.
 Nope.
 I
 was


not
 happy
 about
 it.
 Uh
 they're
 making


batteries.
 Batteries
 are
 very
 dangerous


and
 actually
 very
 complex
 and
 they


brought
 people
 that
 make
 batteries
 and


those
 people
 would
 have
 trained
 our


people
 how
 to
 make
 batteries
 and
 at
 some


point
 they
 would
 have
 gone
 back
 because


they
 want
 to
 go
 back
 to
 their
 country.


They
 might
 not.
 So,
 in
 Trump's
 telling


here,
 and
 I
 was
 struck
 by
 this,
 that
 a


fair
 number
 of
 American
 workers
 just
 may


not
 be
 qualified
 to
 do
 the
 kind
 of


highly
 technical
 manufacturing
 that
 he's


prioritizing
 right
 now,
 something
 like,


you
 know,
 car
 batteries.
 And
 what's


interesting
 about
 that,
 of
 course,
 is,


you
 know,
 President
 Trump
 runs
 on
 a


message
 of
 remembering
 forgotten


America,
 the
 bluecollar
 workingass


Americans,
 you
 know,
 many
 of
 whom
 used


to
 be
 in
 the
 manufacturing
 sector
 who


need
 jobs
 now
 in
 the
 new
 economy.
 And


he's
 kind
 of
 saying,
 let's
 be
 honest,
 a


lot
 of
 those
 people,
 they
 can't
 do
 this


work.


>> Well,
 I
 think
 what
 he's
 saying
 is
 they


certainly
 can't
 do
 it
 at
 the
 beginning.


You
 can't
 just


>> immigrants
 can.


>> That's
 right.
 That
 you
 can't
 just
 drop
 a


car
 battery
 factory
 and
 expect
 it
 to
 be


up
 and
 running,
 right,
 without
 the
 help


of
 the
 technical
 workers
 that
 they
 need


to
 get
 it
 up
 and
 running
 and
 the


American
 workers
 aren't
 going
 to
 catch


on
 until
 that
 happens.


>> To
 be
 honest,
 I'd
 love
 to
 be
 able
 to


create
 an
 immigration
 policy
 that
 works


for
 everyone.


>> You
 like
 a
 comprehensive
 immigration


reform?


>> I
 would
 love
 to
 do
 it
 if
 it
 was


possible.


>> Is
 Congress
 willing
 to
 go
 do
 that?


George
 Bush
 tried.


>> If
 the
 Democrats
 would
 do
 it,
 I'd
 do
 it.


I'd
 love
 to
 have
 a
 comprehensive
 uh


immigration
 policy,
 something
 that


really
 worked.
 It's
 about
 time
 for
 the


country
 to
 have


>> What
 would
 that
 look
 like?


>> Excuse
 me.


>> What
 would
 a
 comprehensive


>> I
 don't
 want
 to
 go
 into
 that
 because


it's
 a
 very


uh
 it's
 a
 very
 ticklish
 subject,
 but
 I


believe
 that
 uh
 there
 is
 a
 plan
 that
 can


work
 for
 everybody.


>> David,
 I
 wonder
 if
 you
 were
 as
 surprised


as
 I
 was
 in
 listening
 to
 this
 interview


by
 the
 president's
 sudden
 enthusiasm


for
 something
 like
 comprehensive


immigration
 reform.
 I'm
 sure
 you


remember
 this
 as
 well
 as
 I
 do.


Comprehensive
 immigration
 reform
 is
 a


word
 that
 if
 a
 Republican
 invokes,
 they


are
 in
 big,
 big
 trouble
 because
 it


almost
 always
 implies
 that
 you're
 going


to
 create
 a
 legal
 path
 for
 those
 here


illegally.
 That's
 the
 comprehensive
 part


of
 immigration
 reform.
 In
 the
 past,


President
 Trump
 has
 sought
 to
 kill
 any


form
 of
 comprehensive
 immigration


reform.
 And
 suddenly
 he's
 saying,
 "I


want
 this."


>> You
 know,
 Michael,
 to
 hear
 President


Trump
 come
 back
 and
 discuss
 this,
 I
 was


sitting
 there
 thinking,
 "How
 is
 his
 own


base
 going
 to
 go
 react
 to
 this?"
 Because


yes,
 the
 core
 of
 it
 is


you
 do
 find
 a
 pathway
 for
 at least
 some


to
 get
 to
 citizenship.
 And
 I'm
 not
 sure


the
 current
 Trump
 base
 is
 ready
 for


that.


>> Can
 we
 move
 on
 to
 the
 economy?
 I
 would


like
 to
 ask
 you
 about
 uh
 Republican


pollsters
 lately
 are
 warning
 that
 you


and
 the
 party
 is
 losing
 ground
 with


young
 voters,
 particularly
 young
 men
 who


are
 concerned
 with
 job
 prospects.


>> Could
 I
 have
 the
 Tik
 Tok
 uh
 thing?


>> But
 what
 would
 you
 say
 to
 those
 young


rigged
 polls?
 Look,
 the
 polls
 are
 rigged


just
 like
 the
 writers.
 But
 there's
 these


are
 Republican
 pollsters
 who
 are
 warning


your
 party
 that
 you
 are


>> not
 doing
 enough
 focus
 on
 American
 jobs.


>> I
 can't
 tell
 you.
 I
 I
 think
 I'm
 very


popular.
 This
 just
 came
 out
 from
 Tik


Tok.


>> It
 came
 out
 just
 recently


that
 Donald
 Trump
 was
 number
 one
 on
 Tik


Tok
 and
 the
 most
 popular
 person.
 So
 you


can
 have
 these.
 I
 don't


>> David
 on
 the
 economy.
 The
 president


pretty
 forcefully
 waves
 off
 the
 idea,


which
 we
 keep
 finding
 in
 poll
 after
 poll


and
 in
 election
 results
 from
 the
 last


off-year
 election,
 that
 voters,


including
 many
 Republican
 voters,
 are


persistently
 feeling
 anxious
 about
 the


economy
 and
 they
 don't
 think
 he
 is


focused
 enough
 on
 it.
 You
 know,
 we
 kept


trying
 to
 steer
 him
 back
 to
 this
 to
 try


to
 get
 him
 to
 think
 about
 the
 economic


anxieties
 of
 ordinary
 Americans.


>> Mr.
 President,
 so
 many
 voters
 voted
 for


you
 because
 of
 the
 economy.
 And
 I
 think


Katie
 just
 wanted
 to
 get
 out.


>> The
 economy
 is
 probably
 the
 best.
 It's


Look,
 the
 economy
 right
 now,
 I
 have


trillions
 and
 trillions
 of
 dollars


coming
 into
 this
 economy,
 more
 than
 any


nation
 has
 ever
 had
 by
 far.
 Our
 economy


is


unbelievable.
 And
 I'm
 bringing
 down
 the


prices.
 Remember
 this.
 I
 didn't
 cause


the
 high
 prices.
 Biden
 did.


>> The
 Wait
 a
 minute.
 Wait,
 wait,
 wait
 one


second.
 I
 inherited
 a
 mess.
 Listen.
 I


inherited
 a
 mess.


>> I
 inherited
 a
 highly
 inflated,
 horribly


run
 country.
 The
 borders
 were
 bad.
 The


military
 was
 bad.
 The
 Afghanistan
 was


the
 worst
 worst
 day
 in
 the
 history
 of


our
 country.
 Maybe
 in
 the
 I
 think
 it
 was


the
 lowest
 point.
 Do
 you
 know
 what
 that


was?
 The
 lowest
 point.
 And
 we
 may
 right


now
 be
 at
 the
 highest
 point.


>> There
 are
 good
 signs
 and
 the
 economy
 is


growing.
 Wages
 are
 keeping
 up
 with


inflation.
 But
 there
 are
 other


indicators
 that
 people
 are
 are
 hurting.


High
 earners.
 10%
 of
 high
 earners
 make


half
 of
 the
 economy
 grow.


>> I'm
 bringing
 they're
 hurting
 because
 of


Biden.
 I'm
 bringing


>> No,
 high
 earners
 are
 not
 hurting.
 It's


the
 low
 earners.
 It's
 the
 middle


earners.
 It's
 the
 people
 that
 you


promise
 to
 help.
 What
 do
 you
 say
 to
 If


you
 look
 at
 my
 achievements,
 the


greatest
 uh
 percentage-wise,


the
 greatest
 beneficiaries
 of
 my
 economy


in
 my
 first
 term
 were
 lowincome
 workers.


And
 it's
 turning
 out
 to
 be
 right
 now


blue
 collar
 workers
 are
 doing
 better


than
 anybody
 else
 percentage-
 wise
 as


they
 measure
 that.
 Uh
 I
 inherited
 a


mess.
 It
 was
 high
 prices.
 It
 was
 high


inflation.
 It
 was
 high
 crime.
 You
 know,


did
 you
 see
 where
 murders
 are
 the
 lowest


they've
 ever
 been?
 Did
 you
 see
 where


crime
 is
 at
 the
 lowest
 point
 it's
 ever


been?
 Do
 you
 know
 why?
 Because
 they


closed
 the
 border
 and
 we
 don't
 have


criminals
 pouring
 into
 our
 country.


>> Mr.
 President,
 do
 you


a
 few
 more
 on
 the
 economy?
 Do
 you
 think


um
 are
 you
 basically
 telling
 Americans


that
 they
 have
 to
 wait
 a
 little
 bit


longer,
 particularly
 low
 and
 middle


income
 Americans?


>> No,
 it
 doesn't.
 I
 can't
 fix
 what
 they


destroyed
 in
 four
 years
 immediately.
 But


if
 you
 look
 at
 it,
 I
 have
 more


investment
 income
 coming
 in
 than
 any


president
 than
 any
 country
 has
 ever
 had.


What
 I've
 done,


>> I
 mean,
 it
 felt
 in
 these
 exchanges
 that


this
 concept
 of
 the
 president
 as


insulated
 from
 the
 American
 economic


challenges
 of
 this
 moment
 was
 very


vividly
 on
 display.
 And
 you
 don't
 sense


that
 he
 is
 empathetic
 to
 those
 who
 are


worried
 about
 the
 economy.
 In
 fact,
 he


kind
 of
 disputes
 the
 premise
 that
 there


is
 anything
 wrong
 with
 the
 economy.


>> That's
 right.
 Or
 that
 new
 technology


like
 artificial
 intelligence


would
 bring
 about
 more
 economic
 anxiety.


>> Mr.
 President,
 just
 on
 AI,
 there
 are


many
 Americans
 who
 are
 concerned
 that
 AI


is
 going
 to


>> uh
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 take
 their
 jobs
 and


they
 will
 not
 will
 be
 out
 of
 work.
 I


think
 just
 the
 opposite.
 I
 think
 AI
 is


going
 to
 be
 a
 tremendous
 job
 producer.
 I


think
 that
 we
 have
 so
 many
 jobs.
 My


biggest
 problem
 isn't
 taking
 the
 jobs,


it's
 that
 we
 don't
 have
 enough
 people
 to


fill
 the
 jobs


and
 that's
 where
 robots
 come
 in.
 And
 so


I
 I
 think
 you've
 got
 to
 come
 to
 your
 own


conclusion
 about
 whether
 or
 not
 there's


anything
 in
 this
 interview
 that
 would


make
 an
 ordinary
 American
 feel
 better


about
 supermarket
 prices
 or
 tightening


job
 market
 or
 the
 anxieties
 that
 come


from
 the
 arrival
 of
 a
 new
 and
 somewhat


terrifying
 new
 technology
 that's
 going


to
 have
 effects
 that
 none
 of
 us
 can


predict.
 So
 David,
 how
 does
 this


interview
 ultimately
 come
 to
 an
 end?


>> Well,
 the
 president
 had
 stuff
 he
 wanted


us
 to
 see.


>> These
 are
 two
 personnel
 actions
 that


Scavino's
 team
 asked
 the
 president
 to


>> Oh,
 I'll
 sign
 it
 in
 two
 seconds.


>> Sorry,
 sir.


>> This
 is
 a
 much
 more
 important
 thing
 to


do.
 So,
 this
 is
 the
 ballroom
 right
 here.


It's
 beautiful.
 People
 love
 it.


>> And
 after
 nearly
 two
 hours
 of


conversation,
 he
 got
 up,
 started


pointing
 out
 paintings
 he
 had
 dug
 out
 of


the
 vault
 of
 the
 White
 House
 and
 hung.


>> Oh,
 get
 the
 get
 me
 the
 model
 real
 fast.


talked
 about
 his
 plans
 for
 the
 White


House
 complex.


All
 a
 reminder
 that
 while
 he
 is
 taking


out
 the
 leader
 of
 Venezuela
 and


threatening
 to
 re-engage
 with
 the


Iranians


and
 denying
 that
 there's
 any
 reason
 for


people
 to
 be
 anxious
 about
 the
 economy.


>> As
 an
 example,
 have
 you
 seen
 the
 white


marble
 floor
 there?


>> No.


>> Well,
 I'm
 going
 back
 up.
 So,
 if
 you


want,
 you
 could
 follow
 me.
 Yeah,
 that'


be
 okay.


>> Well,
 let
 me
 just
 finish
 this.
 So,


>> he's
 also
 busy
 thinking
 about
 rebuilding


the
 White
 House.


>> Sir,
 do
 you
 want
 to
 show
 them
 the


renovation?


>> Yeah,
 let's
 go.
 Come
 on.
 That
 we
 had


enough.
 Nice
 setup,
 right,
 Katie?
 Good.


Two
 hours,
 Katie.
 I
 could
 go
 nine
 hours.


>> We're
 going
 to
 continue.


>> Sir,
 can
 I
 get
 two
 signatures?


>> You
 know,
 I
 did
 a
 uh
 a
 treadmill
 with


the
 military.


>> Well,
 David,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for


walking
 us
 through
 this
 fascinating


conversation
 with
 the
 president.
 When
 we


come
 back,
 we're
 going
 to
 ask
 that
 all


four
 of
 you
 who
 conducted
 this
 interview


sit
 down
 together
 and
 briefly
 reflect
 on


the
 conversation
 and
 what
 you
 all
 took


from
 it.
 So,
 we'll
 be
 right
 back.


[Music]


So,
 Tyler,
 Katie,
 Zolan,
 David
 just


walked
 us
 through
 the
 highlights
 of
 the


interview
 that
 the
 four
 of
 you
 did
 with


him
 because
 this
 went
 on
 for
 so
 long.


There's
 inevitably
 a
 lot
 of
 material


that
 we
 couldn't
 cover.
 So,
 I
 want
 to


begin
 by
 just
 asking
 each
 of
 you,
 what's


one
 thing
 he
 said
 that
 we
 probably


didn't
 cover
 with
 David
 that's
 really


going
 to
 stick
 with
 you
 when
 you
 reflect


back
 on
 this
 interview,
 Katie?
 I
 think


it's
 the
 degree
 to
 which
 the
 president


throughout
 this
 interview
 really
 wanted


credit
 and
 he
 wanted
 gestures
 of


goodwill
 from
 people
 he
 wanted
 respect


from
 be
 it
 Democrats,
 Republicans,


members
 of
 the
 news
 media,
 the
 American


public.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 ways
 I
 felt
 that


that
 was
 manifesting
 during
 this
 whole


encounter
 was
 he's
 building
 a
 ballroom


where
 the
 East
 Wing
 used
 to
 be
 big


enough
 to
 host
 an
 inauguration
 inside


for
 future
 presidents.


>> And
 he
 kept
 going
 back
 to
 this
 idea
 that


he's
 a
 builder.
 He
 mentioned
 that
 maybe


he
 was
 a
 better
 builder
 than
 he
 ever
 has


been
 at
 politics.
 And
 at
 one
 point
 he


summons
 a
 military
 aid
 to
 bring
 in
 an


architectural
 rendering
 with
 miniature


models
 of
 the
 ballroom
 and
 is
 sort
 of


almost
 telling
 us
 and
 himself
 that


building
 being
 built
 over
 there.
 They'll


be
 thanking
 me
 as
 if
 this
 is
 the
 project


that
 will
 do
 it.
 That
 will
 give
 him
 this


credit
 that
 he
 has
 been
 seeking
 in
 this


term,
 his
 last
 term,
 and
 throughout
 his


time
 in
 public
 life.


Zolan,
 what
 about
 you?


>> Katie
 made
 the
 good
 point
 of
 how
 the


president
 is
 so
 motivated
 by
 whether
 or


not
 he's
 getting
 credit.
 And
 it's
 not


just
 about
 whether
 he's
 getting
 credit


now,
 but
 it
 seems
 he's
 also
 motivated
 by


whether
 or
 not
 he
 got
 credit
 in
 the


first
 term.
 And
 he
 did
 not
 seem
 bothered


at
 all
 when
 we
 asked
 him
 about
 his


relatives
 and
 the
 business
 deals
 and
 the


money
 that
 they've
 made
 across
 the
 world


throughout
 his
 second
 term.
 When
 we


pressed
 him
 on
 this,
 he
 was
 saying,


well,
 in
 his
 view,
 his
 family
 showed


restraint
 in
 the
 first
 term
 and
 he


didn't
 get
 credit.


>> Showed
 restraint
 in
 terms
 of
 what
 he
 was


willing
 to
 do
 in
 the
 name
 of
 making
 his


family
 money.


>> That's
 right.
 And
 thus
 now
 in
 this
 term,


he
 said
 that
 he
 was
 pretty
 much


unbothered
 about
 the
 business
 deals
 that


his
 family
 has
 been
 able
 to
 pursue.
 All


this,
 I
 think,
 speaks
 to
 a
 president


who's
 so
 much
 more
 emboldened
 in
 this


second
 term.
 And
 I
 think
 we
 saw
 up
 close


and
 personal
 just
 how
 emboldened
 he
 is.


>> Tyler,


>> one
 thing
 that
 I
 think
 stood
 out
 to
 me,


Michael,
 is
 a
 conversation
 we
 had
 about


anti-semitism
 because
 it's
 become
 such
 a


flash
 point
 within
 the
 Republican
 party


as
 we
 see
 this
 intraparty
 warfare
 over


whether
 or
 not
 there
 is
 space
 in
 the


Republican
 party
 and
 the
 broader
 Make


America
 Great
 Again
 movement
 for
 people


who
 espouse
 anti-semitic
 views,


>> influencers,


>> right?
 And
 JD
 Vance,
 his
 vice
 president,


said
 basically
 that
 as
 long
 as
 you
 love


America,
 you're
 welcome.
 And
 he
 didn't


want
 to
 institute
 purity,


>> even
 if
 you're
 anti-semitic.


>> Right?
 And
 I
 asked
 President
 Trump


whether
 or
 not
 there
 was
 room
 in
 his


movement
 for
 people
 with
 anti-semitic


views.
 And
 he
 said,
 "No,
 I
 don't
 think


we
 need
 them.
 I
 don't
 think
 we
 like


them."
 And
 that
 puts
 him
 at
 odds
 with


leading
 Republican
 figures,
 including


his
 vice
 president,
 who
 seemed
 more
 open


to
 including
 people
 who
 spread
 hateful


views
 within
 the
 party.


>> It
 was
 a
 moment
 where
 he
 really
 came
 out


quite
 strongly
 against
 people
 who
 spread


anti-semitism
 when
 this
 debate
 is


coursing
 through
 his
 movement
 and
 among


his
 supporters,


>> right?
 He's
 drawing
 a
 pretty
 bright
 red


line
 there.
 So,
 one
 last
 question
 for


each
 of
 you.
 What
 is
 your
 ultimate


takeaway
 from
 this
 conversation?


For
 me,
 there
 were
 moments
 in
 this


interview
 where
 it
 almost
 seemed
 like


the
 president
 was
 a
 bystander
 to
 his
 own


policies,
 to
 his
 own
 agenda.
 There
 were


times
 where
 he
 would
 speak,
 for
 example,


about
 an
 interest
 in
 comprehensive


immigration
 reform
 and
 a
 potential


pathway
 to
 citizenship.


>> Well,
 he
 has
 also
 directed
 his
 aids
 to


go
 pursue
 mass
 deportations.
 And
 you


know,
 he
 talked
 about,
 well,
 ICE
 needs


to
 be
 careful
 around
 certain
 industries.


>> You
 run
 ICE.


>> Yeah,
 you
 run
 ICE.
 And
 also
 Steven


Miller
 works
 for
 you.
 Steven
 Miller
 has


been
 clear
 about
 pursuing
 mass


deportations
 as
 well.
 So
 it
 was
 that


distance
 he
 almost
 seemed
 to
 sort
 of
 try


to
 create
 between
 himself
 and
 in
 some
 of


the
 actions
 that
 his
 administration
 is


taking.


>> Yeah,
 that
 is
 fascinating.
 Katie,
 what


about
 you?


My
 major
 takeaway
 from
 this
 is
 that


there
 are
 many
 faces
 to
 President
 Trump


and
 even
 throughout
 that
 interview.
 It


was
 a
 real
 exercise
 in
 wrangling
 those


different
 personas
 because
 he
 was


combative.
 He
 was
 upbeat
 at
 times.
 He


was
 very
 almost
 docel
 when
 we
 were


asking
 him
 probing
 questions
 about
 his


health.
 And
 so
 instead
 of
 being
 the


President
 Trump
 who
 has
 called
 reporters


sedicious
 for
 asking
 questions
 about
 his


health,


>> he
 allowed
 Tyler
 to
 ask
 him
 if
 he'd
 ever


taken
 a
 GLP1
 medication
 before.
 He
 said


no.


>> Quick
 interjection.
 Oh
 yeah.
 What
 did
 he


say?


>> He
 said
 he
 had
 not,
 but
 he
 probably


should.


>> David
 asked
 him
 if
 he
 was
 on
 any
 blood


thinners
 besides
 aspirin.
 The
 answer
 was


no.


>> Yeah.
 Very
 personal
 questions.
 I
 asked


him
 if
 he
 had
 ever
 had
 a
 heart
 attack.


These
 are
 questions


>> no.


>> The
 answer
 was
 no.
 But
 the
 point
 is
 this


was
 a
 different
 version
 of
 him
 and
 you


never
 know
 which
 version
 of
 him
 you
 are


going
 to
 get
 and
 he
 knows
 that.
 He
 knows


that
 if
 a
 foreign
 leader
 calls
 him
 that


person
 does
 not
 know
 who
 is
 on
 the
 other


end
 of
 the
 line.


>> Which
 persona?


>> Yes.
 And
 that
 means
 that
 this
 president


can
 dangle
 consequences
 can
 show
 up
 as


magnanimous.
 he
 can
 show
 up
 as


threatening.
 I
 think
 that
 is
 my
 main


takeaway
 going
 forward.


>> Fascinating.
 David,
 you
 know,
 all


presidents
 in
 their
 second
 term
 turn


more
 to
 foreign
 policy,
 not
 only
 because


they've
 got
 greater
 leverage
 and
 greater


freedom,
 but
 because
 they
 want
 to


establish
 a
 legacy.
 And
 I
 think
 the


first
 thing
 I
 took
 away
 from
 it
 is
 this


is
 somebody
 who
 thinks
 about
 building
 a


foreign
 policy
 legacy
 and
 building


buildings.
 The
 second
 thing
 that
 really


jumped
 out
 at
 me
 was
 that


he
 was
 spending
 this
 time
 with
 the
 New


York
 Times
 because
 he
 really
 wants
 an


approval
 for
 this
 new
 vision
 of
 a


muscular
 America.


And
 I
 think
 he
 was
 making
 what
 he


thought
 was
 a
 significant
 investment
 in


trying
 to
 explain
 a
 new
 approach
 to


managing
 the
 globe.
 Tyler,


>> what
 was
 remarkable
 to
 me
 as
 we
 were
 in


there
 for
 quite
 some
 time
 was
 just


watching
 how
 the
 Oval
 Office
 operated


and
 the
 bubble
 around
 the
 president
 to


support
 all
 of
 his
 needs.
 Whether
 that's


him
 pressing
 the
 red
 button
 on
 his
 desk


to
 get
 a
 Diet
 Coke
 or
 the
 aid
 that
 runs


out
 multiple
 times
 of
 the
 Oval
 Office
 to


pick
 up
 different
 pieces
 of
 paper
 that


he
 has
 requested
 she
 print
 out
 as


evidence
 for
 whatever
 point
 he's
 making


or
 just
 the
 people
 walking
 in
 and
 out
 of


the
 Oval
 Office
 with
 notes,
 whether


that's
 a
 foreign
 leader
 on
 the
 call
 or


an
 aid
 is
 waiting
 outside
 to
 him


combining
 meetings.
 There
 were
 documents


he
 had
 to
 sign
 and
 he
 just
 had
 that


person
 come
 in
 with
 the
 paperwork
 as
 we


were
 sitting
 there
 for
 the
 interview.


His
 phone,
 his
 personal
 cell
 phone
 was


ringing
 multiple
 times.
 He
 took
 one
 call


from
 the
 Fox
 News
 anchor
 Brett
 Bear.
 But


it
 was
 really
 just
 quite
 amazing
 to
 see


how


chaotic,
 frankly,
 the
 Oval
 Office
 can


be.
 And
 we've
 reported
 on
 how
 this


unfolds,
 but
 I
 think
 sitting
 in
 the
 Oval


Office
 for
 an
 extended
 period
 of
 time


and
 watching
 it
 up
 close
 really
 gives


you
 the
 sense
 of
 how
 Trump
 makes


decisions,
 how
 he
 thinks,
 and
 how
 his


world
 operates.


>> Well,
 to
 all
 four
 of
 you,
 thank
 you
 very


much.


>> Thank
 you.


>> Thank
 you,
 Michael.


Here's


[Music]


what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know
 today.


>> The
 A's
 are
 52,
 the
 NAS
 are
 47.
 The


motion
 is
 agreed
 to.
 The
 joint


resolution
 will
 be
 placed
 on
 the


calendar.
 On
 Thursday,
 a
 bipartisan


group
 of
 senators
 voted
 to
 advance
 a


resolution
 that
 would
 force
 President


Trump
 to
 seek
 congressional


authorization
 for
 continued
 military


operations
 in
 Venezuela.


Five
 Republican
 senators
 joined
 all


Democrats
 in
 backing
 the
 resolution.
 One


of
 them,
 Republican
 Senator
 Rand
 Paul
 of


Kentucky,
 said
 that
 one
 factor
 behind


his
 vote
 was
 Trump's
 suggestion
 made
 in


his
 interview
 with
 the
 Times
 that
 the


United
 States
 might
 remain
 involved
 in


Venezuela
 for
 years.


And
 in
 Minnesota,
 local
 authorities
 are


accusing
 the
 federal
 government
 of


blocking
 them
 from
 investigating
 why
 an


ICE
 agent
 killed
 a
 37year-old
 woman
 in


her
 car.
 The
 accusation
 came
 as
 federal


immigration
 agents
 in
 Portland,
 Oregon,


shot
 two
 people
 in
 their
 car
 on


Thursday,
 apparently
 under
 similar


circumstances.


Federal
 officials
 accused
 the
 two
 people


in
 Oregon
 of
 weaponizing
 their
 car


against
 the
 agents.
