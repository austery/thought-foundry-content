I'd like to introduce you
to this comedy wildlife competition.
Now no one’s day will ever be as chill
as that of a raccoon.
Indeed, life throws bad days at all of us.
And sometimes things can get worse.
You can wake up with a bad hair day.
(Laughter)
Now the pictures you're seeing today
are the result of a wildlife
photography competition
that we created to recognize
the positive values of wildlife
and how it impacts all of us.
Now as the competition developed,
we started to receive
thousands of photographs,
more than we'd expected.
And these photographs began to communicate
with us in many different ways,
ways we might have expected,
and then these ways.
(Laughter)
But we began to appreciate
the qualities and charm of these animals,
and we began to put
pictures together that told a story.
They can fly, which everyone knows,
and everyone knows that cheetahs
are the fastest mammal on the land,
but no one knows they're terrified
of being caught speeding.
(Laughter)
While we're on the subject of speed,
woodpeckers make
a rather unexpected appearance
because they believe
they're the fastest birds.
They're not.
But as we know in life, self-belief
is about 95 percent of the job.
(Laughter)
Away from the speed merchants,
you've got the sport jocks
who maybe go out
for a round of golf or not,
depending on the round.
(Laughter)
Then you've got
your left brains, the creatives,
the ones that maybe focus more
on their music, air guitar in the wild.
(Laughter)
And then maybe like dancing
as if nobody was watching.
(Laughter)
Beyond that, you have the superheroes,
the ones that influence the Marvel Comics.
The Jedi squirrel,
the most powerful Jedi in the world.
He controls all the nuts.
And then, probably
even more frighteningly,
you have the animal that can become
completely invisible in any habitat.
(Laughter)
So what you're finding funny
about these pictures, hopefully,
is a little bit different to your neighbor
and to the neighbor next to them
and so on and so forth.
And the result is that it's
unconditionally personal, your reaction,
which makes these pictures
very accessible to everyone.
But it also makes them
cross-border and multicultural,
which is why this competition
has succeeded.
This could be you and your best friend
laughing till you cry,
but it could also just be
a very casual backhanded slap.
It depends how you see it.
(Laughter)
And this? Well, this might be
the morning after the night before.
Exam time, could be anything.
We started to see some more similarities
as we looked at these pictures.
This is the same family row
that we all have.
And within these families,
you have partnerships
with mature and intelligent adults
who talk and understand each other.
(Laughter)
And those partnerships are normally
made up of a talker ...
and maybe a listener.
(Laughter)
The children also seem to show
similarities to us humans.
They need little or no supervision.
(Laughter)
They share without being asked,
which is lovely.
And fortunately they never, ever squabble.
(Laughter)
And then you have the teenage years.
Well, the teenage years,
they do the same thing.
They have no awareness whatsoever.
(Laughter)
They have the very, very common traits
of the staying-in-bed-all-day illness.
Audience: Aww!
TS: And then the even more common trait
of too much screen time.
(Laughter)
And if they're not picking their nose
on the screen or in bed,
that's the cool kids, and they're
out the back having a cigarette.
(Laughter)
Someone said, duck smoking quack,
which I love.
(Laughter and applause)
But if you put a camera on these guys,
they react like all of us. They love it.
(Laughter)
And if they love it that much,
they start doing photo bombs
even when you don't expect it.
(Laughter)
But at the end of the day,
they stay friends
and they come together
for the most brutal of all things --
the family portrait session.
(Laughter)
Comedy Wildlife, our organization --
that's the three of us there,
you'll recognize me on the left.
(Laughter)
We came together because
we wanted to use a positive force
to influence human behavior.
We wanted to use humor to address
the serious topic of conservation,
and in so doing,
encourage people to look up
and appreciate
what they get from wildlife.
Too many messages are negative
about conservation.
We wanted to do it the other way.
The heroes of this competition
are the real photographs
of wildlife doing funny things.
The success of the competition
is based on authenticity,
and the amount of AI talk is great
because this means that we're
slightly different to everyone else.
Actually, the success of the competition,
the pictures have to be funny.
Fortunately, life is filled
with these moments
just waiting to be captured.
This is our 10th year, and each year
we get tens of thousands more entries,
unbelievably,
and they get better and better
and harder and harder to judge.
But we do get there eventually.
Cartier-Bresson, French photographer,
talks about the decisive moment,
that moment when you see an image
through your camera
and you press click and you take that shot
and you make it permanent.
This young lion would discover
what a decisive moment could also mean.
(Laughter)
But as I said at the beginning,
life is not all good.
We have our bad days. That's my favorite.
Audience: Aww.
TS: But the bad days mean that life
is also full of joy and wonder,
and sometimes that joy and wonder
converge onto the absolutely ludicrous.
Our culture over the years
has grown to create a divide
between us and wildlife.
The halcyon days of coexistence
are now long gone.
But we believe we can change that balance
just by changing the narrative
from negative to positive.
My 13-year-old son,
rather innocently
and surprisingly sweetly,
said he thought these pictures made
the animals feel more human, more equal.
In my mind, more relatable.
And I agree with him.
These images raise our spirits.
They create a positive emotion.
That positive emotion leads to empathy,
and it's empathy which leads
to attitudinal and behavioral change.
The pictures I've shown you today,
which are a tiny fraction
of the thousands that we have,
are a reminder to us that it's our job
to be custodians of these tender moments.
That we should accept coexistence
rather than separation,
complete separation from wildlife.
And finally, that ...
diversity on the planet
is a privilege that we should cherish.
However, we may have to
be honest with ourselves
and accept that some species
may already have had enough of us.
Thank you.
(Laughter)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
