85%
 of
 the
 companies
 we
 talked
 to
 said


they
 really
 believe
 they
 only
 have
 the


next
 18
 months
 to
 either
 become
 a
 leader


or
 fall
 behind.
 You
 know,
 we
 have
 our


little
 group
 chat
 where
 we
 have
 another


friend
 who's
 like,
 "Oh,
 all
 this
 stuff


is
 overhyped
 and
 it's
 going
 to
 zero."


Every
 time
 I
 use
 AI,
 it's
 amazing.


>> There's
 somebody
 at
 every
 big
 company


who
 has
 figured
 out
 I
 could
 do
 something


in
 1
 minute
 that
 used
 to
 take
 8
 hours.


28-year-old
 guy
 who
 was
 using
 Chat
 GPT


really
 really
 well
 and
 they
 had
 him


create
 a
 30
 slide
 deck
 and
 they
 did
 a


global
 call
 for
 everyone
 in
 the


investment
 bank
 for
 this
 guy
 to
 spend
 an


hour
 walking
 people
 through
 how
 to
 use


chat
 but
 that's
 absurd
 that's
 an
 absurd


way
 to
 hope
 people
 adopt
 worldchanging


technology
 cursor
 has
 taken
 mediocre


engineers
 and
 made
 them
 good
 but
 it's


taken
 amazing
 engineers
 and
 made
 them


gods
 every
 board
 meeting
 I
 go
 in
 for
 my


other
 four
 metrics
 I
 have
 some
 report
 of


how
 are
 we
 doing
 those
 report
 and
 on
 AI


all
 I
 have
 is
 the
 amount
 of
 stuff
 we


bought
 when
 I
 measure
 becomes
 a
 target.


It
 is
 no
 longer
 accurate
 as
 a
 measure.


>> Even
 though
 we
 thought
 we
 had
 our
 quota


set
 and
 we
 thought
 everyone
 was


productive,
 it
 turned
 out
 we
 thought
 we


were
 productive
 and
 actually
 it
 turned


out
 we
 could
 be
 much
 more
 productive.


>> But
 compared
 to
 what?


>> I'm
 excited
 to
 be
 here
 with
 my
 friend


Russ
 Frerieden.
 Um


>> yeah,
 good
 to
 see
 you.


>> Uh
 I've
 known
 you
 for
 a
 long
 time
 and
 I


think
 when
 I
 first
 met
 you,
 I
 still


actually
 remember
 meeting
 you
 the
 first


time.
 It
 was
 from
 uh
 I
 think
 Josh


McFarland.
 Um,
 and
 Josh
 was
 at
 Google


and
 he
 was
 like,
 "Yeah,
 there's
 this
 guy


Russ
 Fred
 and
 he
 started
 this
 company,


Adify."
 And
 he
 sold
 it
 to
 Cox
 for
 all


this
 money.
 You
 know,
 back
 then
 $300


million
 was
 a
 lot.


>> It's
 It
 is
 amazing.
 I
 I


>> now
 it's
 like
 a
 B-
 round,
 but
 like
 back


then
 like
 that
 was
 a
 huge
 acquisition.


And
 uh
 there
 there
 was
 like
 oh
 like
 Russ


like
 I
 had
 like
 amazing
 person
 that


pulled
 this
 off.
 Um
 and
 uh
 I
 think
 we


met
 in
 Florida.


>> That's
 right.
 uh
 on
 a
 Silicon
 Valley


bank
 trip
 and
 kind
 of
 all
 things
 uh


everything
 comes
 full
 circle
 in
 the
 end.


But
 um
 you
 know
 AI
 is
 probably
 the


hottest
 thing
 in
 the
 history
 of
 the


world.
 Um
 but
 you
 also
 worked
 in
 what


was
 the
 hottest
 thing
 in
 the
 history
 of


the
 world
 in
 web
 1.0.


>> Yeah.


>> But
 now
 there's
 this
 big
 question


actually.
 It
 reminds
 me
 of
 adte.
 I
 think


it's
 kind
 of
 a
 nice
 little
 segue
 because


like
 adtech
 you're
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


does
 the
 advertising
 work,
 right?


>> Like
 a
 lot
 of
 adte
 is
 here's
 an


advertisement
 and
 there's
 this


attribution
 problem.


>> Yep.
 of
 the
 sale
 happened.
 Who
 is


responsible
 for
 that
 sale?
 Was
 it
 the


banner
 ad
 on
 Yahoo?
 Was
 it
 the
 last


click
 that
 happened
 on
 Google?
 Was
 it


the
 coupon
 site
 that
 you
 know
 stuffed
 a


cookie
 on
 your
 machine?
 So
 part
 of


adtech
 is
 just
 how
 do
 I
 figure
 like
 I'm


buying
 ads.
 That's
 part
 of
 it,
 but
 part


of
 it
 is
 also
 did
 it
 work?
 And
 AI,


there's
 all
 sorts
 of
 stuff
 around
 making


AI
 work,
 which
 is
 like
 technically
 very


very
 challenging.
 But
 then
 there's
 the


question
 of
 did
 it
 actually
 yield
 a


benefit?


>> Yep.
 which
 is
 probably
 the
 biggest


question
 for
 I
 mean
 there's
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 like
 myths
 on
 this
 on
 both
 sides


but
 would
 love
 to
 kind
 of
 hear
 about
 the


origins
 of
 Laridan
 and
 how
 you
 think


about
 even
 some
 similarities
 between
 the


two.


>> Sure.
 Yeah.
 There
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


parallels
 really
 to
 what
 happened
 in
 the


'9s
 with
 advertising
 and
 the
 growth
 of


the
 internet
 and
 what
 we're
 seeing
 with


AI.
 I
 mean
 forget
 the
 capital
 markets


perspective.
 It
 is
 it
 is
 funny
 to
 think


about
 uh
 what
 what
 is
 defined
 as
 big


from
 an
 exit
 these
 days
 versus
 5
 years


ago,
 10
 years
 ago,
 20
 years
 ago.
 And


that's
 that's
 kind
 of
 its
 own
 topic,
 but


just
 when
 I
 moved
 out
 here,
 I
 moved
 out


to
 Silicon
 Valley
 in
 1996
 and
 I
 was
 the


first
 guy
 at
 the
 first
 online
 ad


network.
 And
 in
 the
 early
 days,
 it
 was


just
 there
 are
 websites,
 we
 should
 put


ads
 on
 them.
 Great.
 How
 do
 we
 do
 that
 at


scale?
 Great.
 What
 are
 the
 metrics
 we


should
 capture?
 Then
 you
 saw
 the
 growth


of
 things
 like
 comcore
 or
 Neielson
 as


they
 moved
 into
 television
 to
 figure
 out


like
 how
 do
 I
 actually
 plan
 this?
 How
 do


I
 spend
 this?
 How
 do
 I
 give
 tools?


Right?
 All
 of
 the
 money
 lived
 in
 TV
 or


in
 radio
 and
 there
 were
 these
 tools
 like


Neielson,
 Arbitron,
 IMS
 Health
 on
 the


pharmaceutical
 side.
 There
 were
 all


these
 tools
 to
 help
 people
 understand


what
 they
 were
 getting
 when
 they


advertised
 on
 television.
 You
 had
 to


build
 that
 entire
 stack
 for
 the


internet.
 You
 had
 companies
 like


DoubleClick
 or
 Flycast
 where
 I
 was
 or
 uh


companies
 like
 Omnature
 building
 a


different
 part
 of
 the
 stack.
 companies


like
 Comscore
 building
 a
 different
 part


of
 the
 stack
 and
 those
 companies


obviously
 Google
 and
 Facebook
 are
 two
 of


the
 most
 amazing
 companies
 ever
 built


but
 if
 it
 wasn't
 for
 all
 of
 that


infrastructure
 their
 revenue
 just


wouldn't
 have
 grown
 as
 quickly
 and
 I
 I


really
 do
 think
 we'll
 see
 the
 same
 thing


in
 AI
 now
 the
 technology
 is
 unbelievable


and
 you
 know
 my
 core
 thesis
 when
 I
 was


thinking
 about
 starting
 Laridan
 after


having
 been
 you
 know
 the
 first
 guy
 at


the
 first
 online
 ad
 network
 and
 having


been
 maybe
 the
 first
 one
 of
 the
 first


two
 executives
 at
 comcore
 way
 way
 25


years
 ago
 back
 in
 the
 day
 um
 my
 my


partner
 Jim
 and
 I
 sat
 down
 and
 we
 said


look
 you
 know
 every
 time
 there's
 a


tremendous
 shift
 in
 budget
 and


especially
 when
 it
 happens
 at
 a
 great


pace
 like
 what
 happened
 from
 TV
 to


digital
 advertising
 what's
 happened
 in
 a


lot
 of
 categories
 from
 client
 server
 to


cloud
 anytime
 that
 happens
 people
 need


to
 rebuild
 all
 of
 the
 infrastructure


there's
 a
 great
 opportunity
 to
 build
 all


of
 these
 tools
 around
 measurement
 around


governance
 not
 with
 the
 goal
 of
 stopping


anything
 frankly
 with
 the
 goal
 of


accelerating
 it
 because
 if
 I
 am
 a
 large


company,
 yes,
 I'm
 going
 to
 experiment
 a


ton
 with
 AI
 today.
 It's
 the
 most


exciting
 thing
 that's
 happened
 in
 the


last
 20
 years
 from
 the
 technology


standpoint.
 It's
 amazing.
 It's


wonderful.
 But
 also,
 there
 are
 very


boring
 but
 important
 questions.
 I
 have


35,000
 people
 in
 my
 workforce.
 They


can't
 all
 get
 retrained
 all
 at
 once
 with


perfect
 knowledge
 and
 perfect
 security.


How
 does
 it
 affect
 my
 DNO
 insurance?
 Was


the
 project
 ultimately
 valuable?
 So
 we


really
 wanted
 to
 start
 a
 company
 about


how
 would
 you
 build
 kind
 of
 the


measurement
 and
 governance
 set
 of
 tools


not
 to
 be
 a
 gatekeeper
 but
 to
 empower


more
 of
 this
 spending.
 I
 I
 think
 as
 we


grow
 we
 will
 be
 the
 best
 friend
 to
 all


of
 the
 AI
 companies.


>> Yeah.
 And
 and
 um
 I
 mean
 maybe
 we
 can
 get


into
 how
 you're
 doing
 this
 but
 um
 just


to
 kind
 of
 level
 set
 a
 little
 bit
 and
 I


love
 this
 framing
 that
 you
 gave
 me.
 I've


I've
 stolen
 it.
 Um,
 when
 I
 steal
 a


phrase,
 it's
 the
 most
 sincere
 form
 of


flattery,
 of
 course,
 but
 um,
 I
 I
 just


released
 a
 little
 video
 about
 kind
 of


uh,
 how
 software
 is
 eating
 labor.
 So,


you
 know,
 software
 eats
 the
 world.
 This


was
 a
 thesis
 that
 our
 firm
 is
 founded


on,
 but
 it's
 eating
 labor,
 but
 it


doesn't
 actually
 mean
 that
 like
 jobs
 are


going
 to
 go
 away.
 Largely,
 what
 it
 means


is
 that
 people
 are
 going
 to
 be
 like
 10


times
 more
 productive
 or
 I
 can't
 hire


anybody
 to
 do
 this
 job,
 but
 I
 can
 hire


AI
 to
 do
 it.
 So
 you
 have
 companies
 where


uh
 their
 software
 budget
 is
 very
 very


small
 but
 their
 labor
 budget
 is
 enormous


and
 step
 one
 of
 like
 the
 mega


opportunity
 that
 excites
 us
 as
 a
 firm
 is


that
 people
 say
 oh
 I'm
 going
 to
 start


hiring
 software
 but
 now
 that
 means
 that


your
 software
 budget
 is
 enormous.


>> Yes.
 Because
 right
 now,
 if
 you
 have
 like


a
 $10
 billion
 labor
 market,
 labor
 budget


and
 like
 a
 $1
 software
 budget,
 you're


not
 going
 to
 try
 to
 cut,
 you
 know,


optimize
 your
 $1
 software
 budget,
 but


you're
 really
 going
 to
 say,
 "Okay,
 do
 I


need
 to
 hire
 more
 people?
 Can
 I
 make


people
 more
 productive?"
 You
 know,
 all


these
 things
 that
 are
 going
 through


people's
 minds
 right
 now.
 And
 this
 is


yielding
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 mega
 growth
 curves


of
 the
 AI
 software
 companies.
 But
 now,


this
 chart
 is
 going
 to
 be
 a
 little bit


more
 balanced.
 Sure.
 Of
 like
 the
 10


billion
 of
 labor,
 you
 know,
 maybe
 that


goes
 to
 eight
 and
 now
 you
 spend
 two


billion
 or$1
 billion
 on
 software.
 So


like
 the
 the
 net
 spending
 for
 the


company
 is
 actually
 lower,
 the
 company's


more
 profitable,
 productivity
 gains


galore,
 but
 then
 is
 this
 productive?


Like
 I
 always
 want
 to
 know
 if
 the
 humans


are
 productive,
 but
 then
 like
 is
 the


software
 yielding
 more
 me
 more


productivity
 and
 how
 do
 I
 measure
 that?


So
 everybody's
 excited
 about
 this
 gold


rush.
 I'm
 going to
 use
 these
 these


tools,
 but
 like
 do
 they
 work?
 And
 how


well
 do
 they
 work?
 And
 what's
 the


baseline?


>> Yes.
 So,
 so
 I've
 stolen
 your
 framing
 of


it's
 like,
 you
 know,
 if
 Chase
 spends
 $18


billion
 on
 software,
 whatever
 they


>> like
 they
 need
 to
 know
 if
 they're


getting
 their
 money's
 worth,
 they
 need


to
 figure
 out
 if
 this
 is
 actually


efficient
 spend.


>> Yes.
 Look,
 a
 funny
 thing,
 not
 funny,
 a


thing
 you
 will
 hear
 said
 frequently
 by


the
 people
 running
 the
 largest
 AI


companies
 in
 the
 world,
 the
 people


running
 the
 largest
 firms
 investing
 in


AI
 in
 the
 world
 is
 they'll
 say
 something


along
 the
 lines
 of,
 you
 know,
 today


global
 IT
 spend
 is
 $1
 trillion.
 And
 we


think
 because
 of
 AI
 and
 agents
 that


could
 go
 to
 10
 trillion.
 And
 you
 know,


let's
 ignore
 whether
 that's
 true
 or


false.
 It's
 certainly
 the
 bullcase
 for


Nvidia,
 for
 open
 AI,
 for
 all
 of
 the


other
 things
 that
 we
 spend
 all
 of
 our


time
 doing.
 And
 so
 when
 you
 think
 about


it,
 I
 think
 we
 said
 uh
 I
 think
 if
 I


remember
 correctly,
 JP
 Morgan
 Chase's


global
 IT
 spend
 is
 on
 the
 order
 of
 18
 or


19
 billion
 and
 they
 spend
 a
 couple


hundred
 billion
 a
 year
 on
 people.
 So
 if


you
 really
 think
 about
 that,
 well,
 is


their
 IT
 spend
 going
 to
 go
 from
 18


billion
 to
 $180
 billion?


Seems
 unlikely
 in
 the
 next
 couple


months,
 but
 it's
 certainly
 going
 to
 go


up.
 And
 if
 it's
 going
 to
 go
 up,
 what


does
 the
 CFO
 need
 to
 understand?
 And
 at


the
 same
 time
 because
 of
 the
 pace
 you


know
 a
 way
 I
 like
 to
 frame
 this
 that
 I


think
 everyone
 knows
 but
 I
 think
 it's


important
 to
 say
 out
 loud
 is


yes
 there
 have
 been
 tons
 of
 shifts
 right


we've
 shifted
 society
 a
 million
 times


we've
 shifted
 from
 farms
 to
 cities
 right


we
 we
 all
 know
 all
 of
 these
 examples
 but


we
 can't
 we've
 never
 had
 a
 time
 where


we've
 expected
 the
 entire
 global


workforce
 of
 knowledge
 workers
 to
 be


retrained
 immediately
 on
 a
 new
 set
 of


tools
 that
 didn't
 exist
 6
 months
 ago.


Right?
 And
 so
 there
 is
 an
 element
 where


everyone
 needs
 to
 figure
 this
 out
 as
 we


go
 along.
 So
 what
 did
 we
 start
 with
 as
 a


company?
 Right?
 Our
 first
 set
 of
 tools


is
 just
 what
 do
 you
 have
 in
 your
 company


and
 are
 people
 flatout
 using
 it?
 You've


spent
 all
 of
 this
 money.
 Are
 people


using
 it?
 And
 what
 you
 find
 is
 you
 know


80
 something%
 of
 our
 customers
 find
 far


more
 tools
 being
 used
 by
 their
 employees


than
 they
 know
 about
 and
 they've


licensed.
 That
 doesn't
 mean
 it
 was
 bad


by
 the
 way.
 Some
 of
 those
 tools
 are


dangerous
 and
 they
 should
 worry
 about


that.
 Some
 of
 those
 tools
 are
 might
 be


very
 popular
 and
 they
 need
 to
 bring
 them


into
 the
 fold
 and
 understand
 what's


happening.
 But
 from
 an
 IT
 standpoint,


you
 normally
 don't
 allow
 software
 to


just
 be
 used
 across
 your
 organization


with
 access
 to
 your
 organization's
 data


and
 have
 no
 idea
 what's
 happening.
 We're


letting
 that
 happen
 in
 AI
 all
 the
 time.


And
 I
 don't
 really
 say
 that
 to
 our


customers
 as
 a
 fear
 cell.
 It's
 to
 be


expected.
 Things
 are
 moving
 quickly.
 You


have
 to
 know
 what's
 going
 on.
 So
 we


start
 with
 the
 baseline
 of
 just
 flat
 out


what's
 happening.
 The
 second
 set
 of


things
 we
 try
 and
 solve
 is
 how
 do
 we
 get


people
 using
 this
 stuff
 more
 in
 a


productive
 way
 on
 the
 AI
 side
 on
 the


agent
 side.
 How
 do
 we
 get
 people
 using


this
 in
 their
 workflow?
 I'm
 a
 marketer


working
 at
 General
 Mills
 or
 something


like
 that,
 right?
 I'm
 a
 marketer
 working


at
 General
 Mills.
 How
 is
 General
 Mills


going
 to
 help
 me
 use
 these
 tools?
 And


what
 I've
 generally
 found
 with


employees,
 if
 you
 really
 want
 to
 drive


employee
 usage
 of
 tools,
 you
 have
 to


make
 them
 feel
 safe
 so
 they
 won't
 look


dumb.


And
 you
 have
 to
 make
 them
 understand


that
 they
 can
 use
 this
 safely
 without


getting
 fired.
 Because
 again,
 it's
 one


thing
 if
 you're
 22
 years
 old
 and
 you've


been
 using
 these
 tools
 effectively
 your


entire
 life
 since,
 you
 know,
 high


school.
 But
 if
 you're
 a
 42year-old


person
 who's
 been,
 you
 know,
 had
 a


20some
 year
 career
 and
 you're
 working
 in


your
 job
 every
 day
 and
 by
 the
 way,
 you


also
 have
 things
 you
 do
 at
 home
 and
 you


have
 business
 travel.
 You
 have
 all
 of


these
 things
 you
 have
 to
 do.
 Also,
 you


have
 to
 become
 an
 AI
 expert.
 You
 really


would
 like
 to
 not
 look
 dumb
 and
 you'd


like
 to
 accidentally
 not
 upload
 the


wrong
 data
 and
 get
 yourself
 fired.
 This


is
 actually
 a
 bigger
 issue
 in
 some


countries
 where
 there's
 a
 bunch
 of
 EU


regulations
 around
 AI
 that
 do
 matter
 and


if
 I'm
 an
 employee
 at
 a
 company,
 I
 don't


want
 to
 look
 dumb.
 So,
 if
 I'm
 the
 CFO,


we
 bought
 all
 these
 tools.
 What
 did
 we


actually
 buy?
 Number
 one.


>> Number
 two,
 how
 do
 we
 get
 people


actually
 using
 these
 tools?
 Because
 the


usage
 on
 these
 tools
 in
 the
 enterprise


is


>> less
 than
 people
 would
 think
 today,


which
 makes
 sense,
 by
 the
 way.
 I'm
 going


to
 get
 to
 the
 productivity
 thing
 in
 a


second,
 but
 you
 know,
 anyone
 listening


to
 this,
 if
 you've
 ever
 been
 a
 part
 of


any
 software
 rollout
 at
 any
 enterprise


ever,
 a
 very
 boring
 but
 very
 important


question
 is
 how
 do
 we
 drive
 actual


usage?
 And
 sure,
 everybody
 uses
 email.


People
 use
 Workday
 because
 if
 you
 don't


use
 Workday,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 fired,


right?
 You're
 not
 going
 to
 get
 your


paycheck.
 But
 most
 enterprise
 software,


your
 internet
 software
 from
 SharePoint,


things
 like
 that
 are
 used
 by
 a


relatively
 small
 set
 of
 the
 population


that
 you
 wish
 were
 using
 it.
 And
 so
 if


the
 goal
 is
 to
 get
 people
 more


productive
 using
 AI
 tools,
 you
 want
 to


drive
 actual
 employee
 engagement.
 So
 we


built
 a
 suite
 of
 tools
 around
 that.
 And


then
 you
 have
 to
 get
 into
 productivity,


which
 is
 did
 this
 get
 people
 actually


more
 productive?
 Is
 my
 organization


actually
 more
 productive?
 So
 today


I
 I
 know
 where
 I
 want
 to
 go
 with
 Larin.


What
 I
 like
 to
 think
 about
 today
 is
 what


we're
 doing
 today
 on
 the
 productivity


side
 is
 not
 as
 far
 as
 I'd
 like
 it
 to
 go,


but
 it's
 certainly
 better
 than
 anything


that
 exists
 in
 the
 market.
 So
 what
 we're


doing
 today
 is
 we're
 marrying
 the


behavioral
 data
 that
 no
 one
 else
 has,


which
 is
 is
 Alex
 a
 heavy
 user
 of
 chat


GPT
 or
 not,
 just
 flat
 out.
 We're
 not


doing
 it
 at
 the
 individual
 level,
 but


we'll
 use
 that
 example
 for
 the
 podcast


because
 we
 have
 to
 worry
 about
 the


employee
 privacy
 concerns
 that
 companies


have
 for
 their
 own
 employees.
 But
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 day,
 I
 want
 to
 understand,


did
 my
 users
 in
 the
 legal
 department


that
 were
 using
 this
 expensive
 legal


tool
 I
 bought,
 right?


>> Are
 they
 more
 productive
 than
 my
 users


in
 the
 legal
 department
 that
 are
 not?


Because
 what
 I've
 definitely
 done
 is


I've
 driven
 up
 my
 opex.
 I
 bought
 this


software.
 I've
 driven
 up
 my
 opex.
 But


are
 they
 more
 productive?
 Are
 my


marketers
 that
 are
 using
 Claude
 or
 Chat


GPT
 actually
 more
 productive?


>> How
 do
 you
 measure
 that?


>> So
 today
 we
 do
 it
 the
 only
 way


productivity
 research
 has
 ever
 existed


so
 far,
 which
 is
 we
 take
 the
 normal


productivity
 survey
 market
 research
 that


people
 have
 done
 for
 50
 years.
 Not


ideal,
 but
 it
 is
 the
 gold
 standard.
 It's


McKenzie.
 It's
 Towers
 Watson.
 It's


Accenture.
 and
 we
 lay
 on
 top
 of
 it


proprietary
 data
 that
 other
 folks
 don't


have
 which
 is
 actual
 usage.
 So
 the
 way
 I


think
 of
 it
 is
 the
 worst
 way
 to
 measure


productivity
 is
 I'm
 going
 to
 send
 a


survey
 to
 my
 employees
 and
 say
 do
 you


feel
 more
 productive
 today
 from
 using


chat
 GPT.
 First
 of
 all
 there's
 a


definition
 issue.
 Second
 of
 all
 people


are
 going
 to
 answer
 the
 way
 you
 hope


they'll
 answer.
 But
 third
 you
 have
 no


idea
 if
 they're
 actually
 using
 the


tools.


>> So
 a
 better
 way
 to
 do
 that
 I
 learned


this
 years
 ago
 at
 comscore
 I
 one
 of
 the


things
 one
 of
 many
 things
 I
 did
 at


comcore
 is
 I
 ran
 our
 survey
 market


research
 group
 and
 one
 of
 the
 reasons


the
 com
 score
 surveys
 were
 great
 is
 we


had
 the
 behavioral
 data
 married
 with
 the


actual
 survey
 responses.
 We're
 doing
 the


same
 thing
 here.
 Where
 I
 ultimately


would
 like
 to
 get
 to
 is
 full
 passive


measurement
 on
 productivity.
 The
 truth


with
 that
 is
 for
 enterprises
 that's


going
 to
 require
 a
 level
 of
 additional


data
 sharing
 that
 we're
 not
 getting
 yet


from
 customers.
 We
 we
 will
 eventually


get
 there.


>> But
 to
 kind
 of
 like
 put
 a
 finer
 point
 on


this,
 um,
 so
 I'm
 a
 lawyer.


>> I
 work
 at,
 you
 know,
 at
 at
 some
 big


company.
 um
 you
 know
 productivity
 to
 a


certain
 extent
 like
 if
 I
 only
 have
 to


work
 four
 hours
 a
 day
 versus
 eight
 hours


a
 day
 like
 that's
 great
 for
 me
 like
 I


kind
 of
 feel
 like
 it's
 a
 win
 because
 I
 I


often
 think
 about
 like
 the
 principal


agent
 problem
 right


>> so
 uh
 everybody
 is
 an
 agent
 and
 then


there's
 the
 ethereal
 being
 of
 the


corporation
 which
 is
 the
 principal
 and


it's
 like
 you
 know
 yeah
 I
 guess
 if
 I
 own


stock
 in
 my
 corporation
 I
 want
 it
 to
 be


more
 profitable
 but
 really
 I
 want
 to


work
 as
 little
 as
 possible
 and
 get
 paid


as
 much
 as
 possible
 like
 that's
 kind
 of


every
 individual
 agents
 job
 and
 then
 you


have
 these
 tools.
 So
 like
 theoretically


it's
 like
 everybody's
 going
 to
 adopt


these
 things
 if
 they
 get
 to
 be
 lazier.


Yep.


>> Like
 everybody
 wants
 to
 be
 lazier.


>> Sure.


>> Right.
 They
 want
 to
 be
 lazier
 and


richer.
 I
 feel
 like
 these
 are
 like
 the


universal
 like
 kind
 of
 human
 condition.


>> There's
 some
 small
 set
 that
 want


promotions
 but
 I
 agree
 for
 90%
 richer.


That's
 true.
 That's
 true.


>> So
 like
 if
 you
 can
 get
 the
 promotion
 by


doing
 less
 work,
 I'm
 sure
 people
 would


opt
 for
 that.
 But
 I
 guess
 like
 how
 like


think
 about
 everybody
 will
 use
 these


tools
 or
 like
 I
 think
 I
 was
 telling
 you


this
 sad
 story
 because
 our
 kids
 go
 to


the
 same
 school.
 It's
 like
 younger
 kid


gets
 busted
 cheating
 right
 with
 chat
 GPT


like
 clearly
 productivity
 gain
 for
 him


right
 because
 it
 allowed
 him
 to
 be


lazier
 and
 you
 know
 richer
 with
 his


video
 game
 time
 until
 we
 confiscated
 his


phone.
 Um
 but


>> but
 also
 a
 set
 of
 rules
 that
 you
 can
 get


in
 trouble


>> set
 rules
 but
 but
 like
 take
 that
 example


like
 so
 you
 can
 imagine
 the
 individual


agent
 you
 know
 the
 human
 being
 the
 the


lawyer
 in
 this
 example
 is
 benefiting
 you


know
 but
 then
 does
 the
 company
 benefit


because
 to
 a
 certain
 extent
 like
 I'm


paying
 you
 the
 same
 amount
 of
 money
 uh
 I


want
 you
 to
 work
 for
 eight
 hours
 a
 day


right


>> so
 actually
 my
 expectation
 should
 be


that
 if
 you're
 whatever
 I
 don't
 know


what
 the
 lawyer
 does
 but
 like
 drafting


legal
 drafts
 like
 if
 you
 can
 now
 do
 it


in
 4
 hours
 versus
 eight
 you
 know
 and


spend
 4
 hours
 uh
 you
 playing
 golf
 like


you're
 thrilled
 you
 got
 a
 productivity


gain.
 The
 company
 didn't
 actually


benefit,


>> right?


>> Um
 so
 what
 you
 kind
 of
 want
 is
 you
 want


both
 parties
 to
 benefit
 which
 is
 always


tough
 because
 sometimes
 it's
 very
 very


hard
 to
 sell
 products
 to
 people
 that


eliminate
 their
 jobs.


>> Sure.


>> That's
 probably
 the
 hardest
 thing
 to


sell.
 But
 like
 I
 mean
 maybe
 kind
 of


taking
 this
 example
 and
 riffing
 on
 it


like
 uh
 now
 I
 can
 do
 in
 eight
 hour
 like


in
 four
 hours
 I
 can
 do
 what
 used
 to
 take


me
 eight.


>> Sure.
 But
 how
 does
 the
 company
 a


company's
 like,
 "Oh,
 wow.
 You're
 still


you're
 you're
 you're
 operating
 at
 your


baseline,
 but
 actually
 you
 should
 be


able
 to
 do
 twice
 as
 much
 with
 this


tool."
 So,
 I
 guess
 like
 how
 do
 you


define
 the
 baseline?
 How
 do
 you
 address


that
 problem?
 How
 do
 you
 think
 am
 I
 am
 I


framing
 it
 the
 right
 way?


>> I
 I
 think
 I
 think
 you're
 framing
 it
 I
 I


think
 you're
 certainly
 framing
 it
 all


right
 way
 for
 certain
 size
 of
 companies,


right?
 We
 all
 know
 for
 Silicon
 Valley


what
 you're
 going
 to
 have
 just
 because


of
 the
 competition
 and
 the
 equity
 form


of
 compensation.
 What
 you'll
 have
 is
 if


I
 can
 get
 done
 in
 four
 hours
 what
 I


could
 have
 done
 in
 eight,
 I'm
 just
 going


to
 work
 four
 more
 hours
 and
 then
 another


four.
 And
 that
 that's
 very
 different.


That
 that's
 there's
 some
 subset
 of


workers
 at
 all
 size
 companies,
 probably


a
 larger
 percent
 in
 Silicon
 Valley,
 but


a
 smaller
 percent
 in
 at
 GE,
 right?
 There


are
 people
 at
 GE
 who
 want
 to
 one
 day


become
 the
 CEO
 of
 GE
 and
 those
 people


will
 work
 as
 much
 as
 they
 possibly
 can.


So
 there's
 some
 subset
 of
 workers
 there.


For
 the
 rest,
 look,
 there's
 an


interesting
 question
 about
 how
 is


management
 going
 to
 evolve
 overall,


right?
 I
 think
 behind
 all
 this
 the
 first


question
 is
 the
 first
 question
 we're


trying
 to
 solve
 is
 like
 I
 said
 do
 people


use
 these
 and
 from
 a
 corporation


standpoint
 for
 our
 measures
 of


productivity
 which
 is
 we're
 defining
 it


with
 each
 of
 our
 customers
 right
 for
 our


measures
 of
 productivity
 as
 we
 ping


folks
 is
 there
 a
 difference
 in


productivity
 between
 the
 heavy
 users
 and


the
 lighter
 users
 what
 we
 want
 to


measure
 with
 that
 we
 won't
 we're
 not


doing
 this
 today
 what
 we
 want
 to
 measure


with
 that
 is
 then
 some
 concept
 of
 raw


tonnage
 of
 work
 right
 the
 ultimate


there's
 this
 lingua
 franco
 uh
 when
 we


talk
 about
 kind
 of
 employees
 of
 FTE


right
 and
 we
 all
 know
 that
 you
 work


different
 than
 I
 work
 and
 then
 you
 know


various
 people
 work
 and
 we
 all
 know
 that


yet
 if
 I'm
 the
 CFO
 of
 I
 don't
 have
 to


pick
 on
 JP
 Morgan
 again
 if
 I'm
 the
 CFO


of
 JP
 Morgan
 I
 have
 a
 fundamental
 you


know
 horse
 sense
 for
 what
 do
 a
 th00and


FTE
 do
 versus
 500
 FT
 versus
 2,000
 FTE


and
 AI
 is
 going
 to
 break
 all
 of
 that
 for


for
 sure
 and
 so
 our
 main
 goal
 today
 is


just
 to
 build
 the
 baseline
 for
 our


customers
 which
 is
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 A


are
 the
 people
 using
 these
 tools


fundamentally
 more
 productive
 than
 the


folks
 that
 aren't.
 Layer
 on
 top
 of
 that


tonnage
 of
 amount
 of
 time
 worked.
 You


can
 get
 a
 pretty
 good
 It's
 never


perfect.
 People
 are
 on
 vacation.
 You


have
 to
 measure
 this
 as
 groups,
 right?


Any
 given
 person


>> was
 out
 sick
 one
 day
 or
 was
 on
 a
 flight


one
 day
 or
 was
 at
 a
 training
 one
 day


that
 it's
 impossible
 to
 measure
 and
 you


you
 it
 seems
 from
 a
 system
 standpoint


they
 weren't
 working.
 They
 actually
 were


working.
 They
 were
 doing
 a
 training,


right?
 So
 think
 of
 this
 as
 at
 the


aggregate
 data.
 It's
 never
 useful.
 None


of
 this
 data
 is
 ever
 useful
 at
 the
 Russ


Freighten
 level.
 I
 mean
 to
 get


existential,
 was
 I
 productive
 yesterday?


It's
 is
 unknowable.
 Like
 I
 can't
 know
 if


I
 was
 productive
 yesterday.


>> I
 think
 you
 were
 I


>> I
 was
 all
 for
 it.
 But
 what
 we're
 trying


to
 do
 at
 the
 systems
 level
 for
 companies


is
 understand
 is
 there
 some
 correlation


between
 specific
 use
 of
 these
 tools
 on


advanced
 side,
 light
 side,
 heavy
 side,


he
 heavy
 user
 of
 the
 tool,
 lighter
 use


of
 the
 tool.
 Were
 the
 were
 the
 users


more
 productive
 in
 their
 job?
 Were
 the


employees
 more
 productive
 in
 their
 job?


and
 then
 measure
 on
 top
 of
 that
 amount


of
 time
 those
 segments
 of
 workers
 were


actually
 working
 because
 the
 goal
 if
 I'm


a
 CFO
 today
 is
 not
 to
 understand
 did
 Ben


do
 a
 good
 job
 and
 did
 Tina
 do
 a
 good
 job


the
 goal
 is
 to
 understand
 I
 have


definitely
 been
 asked
 to
 spend
 50%
 more


on
 opex


>> right


>> did
 I
 drive
 something
 right
 and
 and
 then


by
 the
 way
 there
 are
 interesting


questions
 we
 know
 this
 around
 staffing


size
 and
 will
 companies
 get
 more
 done


because
 people
 will
 actually
 work
 eight


hours
 Yeah,


>> look,
 it
 will
 turn
 out
 I
 suspect
 it
 is


true
 that


this
 is
 one
 of
 the
 things
 managers
 do.
 I


suspect
 it
 is
 true
 over
 time
 if
 it


becomes
 clear
 that
 all
 of
 your
 employees


are
 now
 working
 four
 hours
 a
 day
 instead


of
 eight.


>> You
 will
 probably
 decide
 to
 have
 fewer


employees
 and
 they
 will
 work
 the


remaining
 employees
 will
 work
 six
 hours


a
 day.
 I'm
 not
 sure
 I
 really
 buy
 in
 the


next
 couple
 of
 years
 you
 will
 see
 people


in
 large
 companies
 actually
 just
 working


half
 as
 much.
 You
 know,
 sole
 proprietors


is
 what
 it
 is.
 Like
 I
 if
 I
 were
 a
 sole


proprietor
 lawyer


kind
 of
 my
 only
 measure
 of
 productivity


today
 is
 to
 myself
 anyway,
 right?
 It's


how
 hard
 do
 I
 want
 to
 work
 and
 how
 much


money
 do
 I
 want?


>> Well,
 there
 the
 principle
 is
 the
 agent.


This
 is
 why
 it's
 like
 but
 this
 is
 this


is
 why
 it's
 so
 important
 and
 this
 is
 why


I
 mean
 candidly
 I
 love
 what
 you
 do.


Obviously
 I
 love
 what
 you
 do.
 That's
 why


you're
 here.
 Um
 but
 uh
 you
 there
 is
 no


baseline
 like
 it's
 like
 did
 this
 work


well
 first
 you
 have
 to
 know
 how
 like
 you


have
 to
 define
 the
 outputs
 you
 have
 the


inputs
 which
 are
 largely
 just
 like
 time


and
 money
 right


>> um
 and
 then
 you
 have
 the
 outputs
 and


part
 of
 it
 is
 actually
 it
 is
 kind
 of


complicated
 to
 come
 up
 with
 an
 output


like
 do
 you
 know
 a
 good
 heart's
 law


>> uh
 go
 ahead


>> so
 goodart's
 law
 I
 I
 love
 this
 one
 it's


like
 when
 a
 target
 becomes
 a
 measure


sorry
 when
 a
 measure
 becomes
 a
 target


>> yes


>> it
 is
 no
 longer
 accurate
 as
 a
 measure


Yes.


>> Right.
 So,
 if
 I
 say,
 "Okay,
 I'm
 going
 to


judge
 you
 based
 on
 I'm
 going
 to
 like
 how


many
 emails
 are
 sent
 every
 day."
 Well,


that's
 a
 measure.
 But
 once
 it
 becomes
 a


target,
 it's
 like
 I
 want
 you
 to
 send


more
 emails.
 Well,
 you're
 no
 longer
 like


the
 measurement
 gets


>> corrupted
 because
 because
 now
 now
 people


decide
 to
 do
 more
 things
 to
 hit
 this


target
 and
 it's
 no
 longer
 an
 objective


measure.
 So,
 you
 know,
 part
 of
 it
 is
 if


I'm
 trying
 to
 figure
 out
 like,
 okay,


there's
 a
 product
 called
 Harvey.
 A
 lot


of
 people
 love
 Harvey
 and
 it
 seems
 to


make
 people
 a
 lot
 more
 productive
 but


compared
 to
 what


>> right
 and
 so
 to
 me
 the
 only
 way
 you


answer
 that
 we'll
 talk
 about
 Harvey


nothing
 against
 Harvey
 I'm
 sure
 Harvey


is
 amazing
 uh
 to
 me
 the
 only
 way
 to


really
 understand
 this
 and
 that's
 why
 I


think
 the
 traditional
 way
 companies
 are


doing
 this
 just
 doesn't
 work
 at
 all


which
 is
 hey
 let's
 survey
 the
 people


that
 use
 Harvey
 and
 ask
 them
 if
 they


were
 productive
 and
 by
 the
 way
 they
 will


all
 say
 yes
 because
 no
 one
 ever
 answers


they
 weren't
 number
 one
 and
 number
 two


my
 boss
 paid
 for
 the
 product
 I'm
 I'm


going
 to
 say
 it
 was a
 good
 product
 right


unless
 We
 all
 universally
 hate
 it
 which


I
 assume
 is
 not
 true
 of
 Harvey
 because


everyone
 seems
 to
 like
 Harvey.
 So
 that's


wonderful.
 So
 I
 think
 all
 you
 can


actually
 do
 is
 it's
 why
 I
 think
 the


traditional
 way
 of
 measuring
 this
 is


broken.
 Look,
 it's
 why
 we
 started


learning
 it.
 All
 you
 can
 really
 do
 is


understand
 without
 asking
 people
 how


much
 usage
 of
 Harvey
 are
 these
 people


actually
 doing,
 right?
 We
 have
 five


people,
 we
 have
 six
 people,
 whatever


they'd
 say
 on
 a
 survey.
 Two
 have
 never


logged
 in.
 Right?
 We've
 all
 seen
 the


joke
 about,
 you
 know,
 your
 project
 is


due.
 It's
 due
 in
 an
 hour.
 You
 said
 you


were
 caught
 up
 and
 then
 you,
 oh
 [ __ ]
 I


have
 to
 ask
 permission
 for
 this
 Google


back,
 right?
 So,
 there's
 two
 of
 the
 six,


I'm
 making
 these
 numbers
 up,
 of
 course.


Two
 of
 the
 six
 people
 actually
 signed
 up


for
 Harvey
 the
 day
 they
 were
 told
 and


then
 never
 went
 back
 to
 it
 all.
 They're


very
 happy
 with
 the
 way
 they
 work.
 They


work
 that
 way
 all
 day,
 every
 day.
 Two
 of


the
 six
 log
 in
 and
 use
 a
 little
 bit.
 And


two
 of
 the
 six
 use
 it
 all
 the
 time.
 The


only
 way
 I
 can
 even
 begin
 to
 understand


if
 that
 software
 is
 valuable
 is
 by


knowing
 that
 data
 passively
 without


asking
 those
 folks
 the
 question
 and
 then


asking
 everyone
 the
 same
 questions
 about


productivity
 and
 measure
 with
 amount
 of


work
 actually
 output.
 And
 if
 I
 take


those
 three
 things
 together
 then
 I
 can


begin
 to
 form
 an
 understanding
 of
 was


Harvey
 useful.


>> Right?
 You
 and
 I
 had
 a
 discussion
 with


someone
 uh
 where
 they
 were
 talking
 about


one
 of
 the
 ways
 they
 uh
 incent
 their


engineers
 at
 their
 company
 is
 they
 have


a
 leaderboard
 of
 the
 amount
 of
 money


each
 engineer
 spends
 on
 cloud
 code.
 And


the
 founder
 was
 talking
 about
 how
 uh
 he


went
 to
 one
 of
 his
 best
 engineers
 and


said,
 "I
 don't
 understand
 what's


happening.
 You're
 one
 of
 our
 best


engineers.
 Why
 aren't
 you
 spending
 any


money
 with
 uh
 cursor?
 I'm
 sorry,
 not


cloud
 code.
 Why
 aren't
 you
 spending
 any


money
 with
 cursor?
 I
 I
 really
 don't
 get


what's
 going
 on."
 And
 so
 that
 that
 was


an
 example
 of
 for
 these
 companies
 where


they're
 very
 developer
 heavy,


>> right?


>> You
 probably
 don't
 need
 us.
 If
 you're
 a


very
 developer
 heavy
 company,
 probably


measuring
 amount
 of
 money
 spent
 on


cursor
 plus
 your
 kind
 of
 normal


management
 understanding
 of
 is
 this


person
 actually
 working?
 If
 they
 come
 in


for
 two
 hours
 a
 day,
 you
 may
 be
 happy


with
 that,
 you
 may
 not.
 That's
 going to


be
 company
 specific
 and
 lifestyle


specific
 and
 culture
 specific.
 But


you're
 in
 the
 office.
 I
 see
 you're


there.
 You're
 not
 spending
 any
 amount


money
 on
 cursor.
 what's
 up
 right
 we
 have


these
 metrics
 the
 issue
 though
 is
 we
 see


this
 explosion
 of
 there's
 hundreds
 of
 AI


tools


>> and
 companies
 have
 hundreds
 of
 roles
 and


so
 that's
 why
 we
 want
 to
 try
 and
 replace


you
 know
 the
 Mackenzie
 corporate
 health


index
 or
 tal
 Watson
 or
 the
 Accenture


surveys
 with
 some
 real
 useful
 data


around
 AI
 but
 I
 think
 that
 kind
 of


cursor
 example
 really
 crystallized
 in
 my


mind
 what
 you'd
 want
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do


for
 a
 whole
 company
 which
 is
 how
 much


did
 this
 person
 work
 so
 I
 have
 that
 qual


you
 know
 I
 have
 that
 quantitative


judgment
 qualitatively
 as
 a
 matter


manager,
 right?
 We're
 not
 replacing


this.
 Did
 they
 do
 a
 good
 job?
 And
 then


fundamentally,
 did
 they
 use
 the
 tools?


And
 when
 you
 take
 those
 three
 things


together,
 that's
 the
 only
 way
 you're


going to
 have
 measurement.
 And
 like
 I


said,
 when
 you
 think
 about
 my,
 you
 know,


micro
 world
 of
 if
 you
 really
 think
 JP


Morgan
 is
 going
 to
 go
 from
 spending
 18


billion
 in
 it
 to
 30
 billion
 or
 40


billion,
 the
 CFO
 is
 not
 just
 going
 to


say
 no
 problem.
 Right.
 Today,
 our


customer
 is
 a
 CIO.
 I
 think
 over
 time,


our
 customer
 becomes
 a
 partnership
 with


the
 CIO
 and
 the
 CFO.
 The
 numbers
 are


just
 big.


>> Yeah.


>> It's
 like
 cloud
 spend.
 the
 numbers
 are


just
 so
 big,
 people
 are
 going
 to
 pay


attention.
 It's
 going
 way
 beyond


experimental.


>> Well,
 and
 obviously
 the
 companies


themselves,
 like
 if
 you
 ask
 any
 company


that
 is
 trying
 to
 sell
 you
 anything
 and


you
 ask
 them,
 does
 your
 product
 work,


they
 will
 probably
 99
 times
 out
 of
 99


say
 like,
 of
 course
 it
 does,
 right?
 That


like
 it's
 the
 best.
 It's
 the
 best.
 You


need
 to
 have
 an
 independent
 arbiter.


>> Um,
 and
 that
 that's
 where
 you
 guys
 come


in.
 But
 kind
 of
 like
 double
 clicking
 on


this
 this
 point
 before,
 it's
 almost
 like


reinforcement
 learning
 at
 a
 companywide


level,
 right?
 Of
 what
 is
 the
 outcome


that
 I'm
 looking
 for?
 And
 sometimes
 it's


clear,
 right?
 Right.
 So,
 um,
 and
 this
 is


where
 the
 the
 measurement
 and
 target


thing
 is
 also
 relevant
 because
 it's
 like


I
 want
 you
 to
 write
 more
 lines
 of
 code.


Whoa,
 if
 that's
 there's
 a
 measurement
 of


like
 how
 many
 lines
 of
 code
 were


written,
 but
 if
 it
 becomes
 the
 target,


then
 you're
 just
 like
 writing
 gobbly


good
 code
 and
 like
 you're


>> for
 sales
 it's
 very
 easy.
 I
 want
 you
 to


sell
 more
 stuff,
 but
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


latency
 between
 like
 you
 go
 talk
 to
 a


customer
 and
 then
 you
 go
 collect
 money.


So
 you
 might
 have
 targets
 in
 between,


you
 might
 have
 measurements
 in
 between


if
 you're
 a
 lawyer,
 draft
 more


contracts.
 So
 I
 guess
 how
 do
 you
 try
 to


define
 the
 goals?
 Because
 some
 of
 them


are
 just
 like
 it's
 kind
 of
 I
 think
 of
 it


as
 like
 background
 information
 that's


going
 through.
 It's
 like
 emails
 that
 are


being
 sent
 or
 you
 know
 Slacks
 that
 were


sent
 or
 Google
 Docs
 that
 were
 edited.


like
 there
 are
 these
 key
 like
 there
 are


these
 very
 very
 clear
 measurements
 but


those
 aren't
 necessarily
 outputs.
 So


first
 to
 your
 point
 on
 measurement
 this


is
 why
 I
 said
 earlier
 if
 you
 think
 about


anytime


true
 third-party
 measurement
 exists


there's
 this
 interesting
 dynamic
 and
 we


saw
 this
 at
 com
 scorecore
 but
 everyone


has
 seen
 this
 anytime
 they
 tried
 to


build
 a
 third
 party
 measurement
 company


omnature
 saw
 this
 in
 the
 early
 days


Google
 at
 some
 point
 fought
 it
 and
 then


actually
 bought
 urchin
 and
 built
 Google


analytics
 right
 because
 it
 turned
 out


it's
 actually
 good
 when
 your
 customers


can
 track
 value
 if
 what
 you
 do
 is


actually
 valuable
 right


>> and
 so
 my
 general
 perspective
 is
 I
 think


Today
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 AI
 companies
 probably


look
 a
 scance
 at
 us
 but
 I
 think
 over


time
 certainly
 the
 AI
 tools
 that


actually
 provide
 value
 are
 going
 to
 love


us
 right
 the
 way
 you
 will
 ultimately


unlock
 real
 enterprise
 budget
 is
 because


people
 believe
 these
 tools
 are
 actually


valuable
 so
 what
 we
 do
 today
 and
 this
 is


a
 journey
 right
 the
 company's
 about
 a


year
 old
 so
 what
 we
 do
 today
 is
 we
 work


with
 all
 of
 our
 customers
 say
 look
 here


are
 the
 baseline
 productivity
 questions


that
 are
 gold
 standard
 that
 people
 have


asked
 for
 70
 years
 you
 know
 there's
 pros


and
 cons
 to
 them
 but
 this
 is
 you
 have
 to


start
 somewhere.
 This
 is
 where
 we
 start


and
 let's
 define
 a
 set
 of
 metrics
 for


each
 of
 your
 uh
 departments.
 One
 of
 the


things
 we've
 found
 that
 actually
 seems


to
 matter
 not
 as
 a
 metric
 that
 companies


share
 with
 their
 employees
 because
 then


you
 have
 the
 good
 hearts
 law
 problem
 but


as
 an
 actual
 reality
 on
 the
 ground
 is


fundamental
 responsiveness.
 There
 is
 an


element
 of
 I
 spend
 some
 amount
 of
 money


on
 my
 legal
 department
 and
 I
 am
 happy


with
 the
 amount
 of
 productivity
 they
 do


today.
 So
 there
 is
 an
 element
 of
 unless


I'm
 trying
 to
 fire
 lawyers,
 which
 I'm


not,
 you
 can
 argue
 I
 how
 would
 I
 measure


the
 value
 of
 software?
 I
 guess
 my


lawyers
 might
 be
 happier,
 but
 I
 don't


have
 a
 churn
 problem
 there.
 So
 frankly,


why
 should
 I
 do
 this?
 And
 so
 what
 we


found
 is
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 found
 is


just
 almost
 an
 interdep
 departmental


SLA,
 which
 is
 it
 turns
 out
 if
 I
 roll
 out


these
 tools
 and
 I'm
 not
 firing
 employees


because
 one
 way
 to
 look
 at
 this
 is
 could


I
 fire
 half
 my
 lawyers.
 Turns
 out


companies
 don't
 really
 like
 firing


people.
 Companies
 do
 fire
 people
 if
 they


have
 to,
 but
 I've
 actually
 never
 met
 a


CFO
 that
 got
 excited
 about
 firing
 30%
 of


the
 workforce.
 Outside
 of
 call
 centers,


that's
 a
 different
 issue
 we
 could
 talk


about.
 Like
 companies
 treat
 their
 call


center
 employees
 different
 from
 the
 rest


of
 their
 employees.
 But
 outside
 of
 call


centers,
 I've
 never
 met
 a
 CFO
 who
 was
 if


you
 went
 to
 a
 CFO
 and
 said,
 "You
 can


fire
 half
 your
 FPNA
 people."
 He
 doesn't


want
 to
 fire
 Tina.
 He
 knows
 Tina.
 He's


met
 Tina's
 husband
 and
 children.
 He


doesn't
 want
 to
 fire
 Tina.
 He'd
 like


Tina
 to
 be
 happier
 and
 more
 productive.


And
 actually,
 he'd
 like
 her
 to
 do
 a


great
 job
 and
 never
 quit,
 right?


Companies
 don't
 really
 like
 churn.
 So


one
 of
 the
 metrics
 we
 found
 that
 people


seem
 quite
 excited
 about
 is
 just
 did


this
 raise
 or
 lower
 the
 interdep


departmental
 responsiveness.
 So
 a


measure
 would
 be
 am
 I
 now
 comfortable


sending
 more
 things
 to
 legal.
 Right?
 If


I'm
 going
 to
 keep
 my
 legal
 department


the
 same
 size
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 start


suing
 more
 people.
 We're
 talking
 about


companies
 here
 not
 law
 firms
 where
 is
 a


different
 measure
 of
 productivity
 right


there.
 Cost
 centers
 not
 profit
 centers.


So
 one
 thing
 to
 do
 it
 is
 did
 over
 time


because
 my
 lawyers
 are
 now
 more


productive
 are
 other
 departments
 asking


them
 more
 questions
 are
 they
 getting


their
 responses
 faster
 when
 I'm
 in


product
 and
 I'm
 asking
 for
 input
 from


engineers
 are
 they
 responding
 more


quickly
 right
 that
 is
 a
 that
 is
 a
 good


way
 for
 me
 to
 see
 behaviorally
 we
 become


more
 productive
 that's
 not
 lines
 of
 code


now
 by
 the
 way
 I
 agree
 if
 you
 expose
 the


metric
 and
 say
 hey
 you
 better
 be


responsive
 people
 can
 lie
 they
 can
 send


slack
 messages
 back
 and
 forth
 but
 what


I'd
 really
 like
 to
 understand
 is
 as
 a


app.
 Which
 of
 my
 departments
 use
 these


tools
 more?
 And
 do
 they
 become
 more


responsive
 to
 my
 other
 departments


because
 there's
 an
 element
 of
 when


you're
 at
 a
 big
 company,
 people
 know


this.
 It's
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 small


companies
 do
 so
 well
 in
 innovation.


There's
 just
 a
 giant
 coordination


problem
 for
 all
 of
 these
 companies.
 And


we
 know
 this.
 And
 you
 know,
 in
 Silicon


Valley,
 it's
 fun
 to
 make
 fun
 of
 these


companies.
 But
 actually,
 every


entrepreneur's
 secret
 dream
 is
 to
 become


so
 large
 that
 they
 have
 a
 giant


bureaucratic
 company.
 Of
 course,
 Google


did
 not
 plan
 to
 have
 a
 giant
 bureaucracy


30
 years
 ago.
 they
 just
 became
 so


successful
 they
 now
 do
 have
 a
 giant


bureaucracy.


>> Right.
 And
 uh
 you
 know
 kind
 of
 that


that's
 kind
 of
 a
 good
 segue
 into
 perhaps


the
 the
 state
 of
 AI
 enterprise.
 Right.


So
 you
 went
 on
 this
 whole
 like
 listen


you
 talked
 about
 what
 350
 people.


>> Yeah.
 We
 we
 interviewed
 350
 heads
 of
 IT


at
 major
 companies.


>> Um
 and
 across
 the
 whole
 the
 whole
 gamut,


right?
 It
 was
 it
 wasn't
 just
 uh
 you
 know


kind
 of
 Silicon
 Valley
 companies
 that


>> not
 not
 I
 mean
 in
 all
 honesty


my
 whole
 career
 basically
 I
 spent
 a


couple
 years
 helping
 my
 friend
 at
 Carbon


and
 I
 spent
 a
 year
 trying
 to
 fix


wine.com
 but
 other
 than
 that
 my
 whole


career
 has
 been
 selling
 software
 to


large
 companies
 mostly
 large
 companies


or
 older
 companies
 yes
 there's
 the


occasional
 Silicon
 Valley
 company
 that


grows
 very
 quickly
 but
 if
 you
 are in
 the


Fortune
 500
 you
 are
 going
 to
 be
 20
 plus


years
 old
 99%
 of
 the
 time
 right
 and
 so


if
 you're
 going
 to
 sell
 to
 someone
 with


more
 than
 a thousand
 employees.
 They're


almost
 by
 definition
 an
 older
 company.


>> Yeah.
 So,
 what
 may
 maybe
 give
 us
 the


highlights
 of
 of
 what
 you
 learned.


>> Sure.
 We
 we
 saw
 a
 bunch
 of
 different


things
 and
 you
 know,
 people
 have
 seen


this
 before.
 I
 I
 actually
 don't
 think
 of


this.
 You'll
 see
 people
 turn
 this
 into


kind
 of
 clickbaity
 fear-mongering


things.
 I
 don't
 I
 don't
 really
 think
 of


it
 that
 way.
 So,
 first
 of
 all,
 we
 saw


like
 is
 we
 know
 this
 from
 Gardner.


There's
 like
 $700
 billion
 being
 spent
 in


enterprise
 AI.
 It's
 growing
 very
 very


quickly.
 It's
 going
 to
 keep
 growing


quickly.
 And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 we
 found


is
 something
 like
 70%
 of
 leaders
 we


talked
 to
 said
 we
 are
 sure
 we
 are


wasting
 money
 here.
 It's
 being
 spent
 so


quickly.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 shame
 on
 us.
 We


had
 no
 system
 to
 measure
 this
 in
 the


first
 place.
 I'll
 get
 back
 to
 the
 report


in
 a
 second,
 but
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 a


customer
 today.
 Uh
 why
 did
 we
 sign
 them


as
 a
 customer?
 They're
 a
 very
 profitable


business
 owned
 by
 a
 PE
 firm
 and
 their


bosses,
 the
 their
 PE
 owners,
 gave
 them


five
 things
 they
 had
 to
 do
 this
 year.


And
 one
 of
 the
 five
 was
 adopt
 AI
 across


the
 organization.
 And
 he
 said,
 "Every


board
 meeting,
 I
 go
 in
 for
 my
 other
 four


metrics,
 I
 have
 some
 report
 of
 how
 are


we
 doing
 against
 those
 reports."
 And
 on


AI,
 all
 I
 have
 is
 the
 amount
 of
 stuff
 we


bought,
 right?
 It's
 not.


>> So,
 yes,
 yes,
 I'm
 doing
 great.
 But
 it


turned
 out


>> we
 have
 a
 large
 family
 of
 AI.
 We
 adopted


all
 these.
 It's
 all
 great.
 But
 it
 turns


out
 we
 want
 to
 actually
 do
 it.
 And
 so


what
 we
 found
 is
 these
 leaders
 like


maybe
 they
 are
 right
 that
 70%
 of
 their


projects
 are
 failing


regardless
 of
 their
 right.
 It's
 a
 giant


problem.
 They
 feel
 that
 way
 because
 they


have
 no
 system
 to
 figure
 it
 out
 in
 the


first
 place.
 No
 one
 believes
 75%
 of


their
 ad
 spend
 is
 failing.
 It's
 not


because
 their
 ad
 planners
 are
 smarter


than
 their
 AI
 buyers.
 It's
 because
 there


are
 20
 years
 of
 systems
 in
 place
 to
 help


me
 understand
 when
 I
 buy
 this
 ad


campaign,
 when
 I
 spend
 this
 money,
 when


I
 do
 this
 app
 install,
 whatever
 it
 is,


did
 it
 actually
 drive
 value
 for
 me?
 And


we
 just
 don't
 really
 have
 that
 in
 AI,


like
 I
 said,
 outside
 of
 some
 very,
 very


specific
 verticals.
 And
 so
 really,
 the


biggest
 thing
 we
 found
 was
 kind
 of
 three


things.
 One,
 you
 saw
 the
 AI
 spend.
 Two,


something
 like
 I
 said,
 they
 believe
 70s


something%
 of
 AI
 projects
 are
 wasted.


But
 the
 other
 thing
 we
 found
 is


basically
 80
 85%
 I
 can't
 remember
 80
 85%


of
 the
 companies
 we
 talked
 to
 said
 they


really
 believe
 they
 only
 have
 the
 next


18
 months
 to
 either
 become
 a
 leader
 or


fall
 behind.
 So
 I
 think
 one
 of
 the


things
 one
 of
 the
 reasons
 you've
 seen


this
 giant
 unlock
 and
 budget
 is
 there's


tremendous
 anxiety
 at
 these
 enterprises


going
 like
 we're
 going
 to
 lose
 if
 we


don't
 adopt
 this
 stuff
 yet.
 So
 we're


adopting
 it
 quickly.
 We
 have
 no


particular
 idea
 if
 it's
 succeeding.
 Our


employees
 aren't
 really
 using
 it.
 by
 the


way
 a
 forgotten
 group
 in
 the
 company
 for


all
 of
 this
 AI
 and
 uh
 from
 my
 last


company
 we
 built
 a
 very
 very
 large
 HR
 uh


technology
 company
 uh
 we
 sold
 into
 heads


of
 HR
 touched
 all
 the
 employees
 in
 the


company
 but
 we
 sold
 into
 heads
 of
 HR
 and


so
 as
 we've
 talked
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 our
 old


customers
 who
 aren't
 really
 our


customers
 today
 but
 they're
 influencers


what
 they
 will
 all
 say
 at
 all
 of
 these


large
 companies
 is
 hey
 our
 employees
 are


really
 worried
 it's
 not
 even
 they're


worried
 they're
 going to
 lose
 their
 job


there's
 a
 base
 level
 of
 worry
 about
 AI


and
 the
 economy
 all
 that
 stuff
 it's
 not


even
 they're
 worried
 they're
 going
 to


lose
 their
 job
 it's
 just
 they're
 getting


told
 to
 use
 a
 new
 system
 all
 day
 every


day,
 right?
 Generally,
 if
 you
 work
 in
 a


large
 company,
 there's
 one
 or
 two
 new


systems
 initiatives
 a
 year.
 Now,
 there's


20
 new
 tools.
 They
 don't
 know,
 they


don't
 know
 what
 they're
 allowed
 to
 do,


and
 they
 have
 no
 training.
 How
 do
 they


actually
 how
 do
 I
 get
 people
 using
 these


tools?
 And
 so,
 you
 have
 this
 weird
 we


you
 have
 this
 weird
 almost
 perfect


storm.
 It's
 why
 we're
 excited
 about


Laren.
 It's
 why
 you're
 excited
 about


Laren.
 You
 have
 this
 perfect
 storm
 of


tremendous
 growth
 in
 budget,
 tremendous


anxiety
 that
 none
 of
 it
 is
 working,


tremendous
 anxiety
 from
 their
 employees


about
 what
 they're
 even
 allowed
 to
 do.


And
 so
 what
 we're
 trying
 to
 do
 is
 I


don't
 think
 we
 solve
 all
 of
 that.
 That


would
 be
 an
 absurd
 thing
 to
 say,
 but
 I


think
 we
 really
 help
 with
 all
 of
 that


about
 like
 what
 is
 your
 plan
 to
 measure


this
 in
 the
 first
 place?
 Did
 anyone
 use


it?
 Did
 they
 become
 more
 productive
 when


they
 did?
 How
 do
 you
 give
 them
 the
 tools


to
 use
 it
 more?


>> Yeah.
 Well,
 and
 that
 that
 kind
 of
 last


point
 is
 super
 interesting
 as
 well


because
 it's
 like
 there's
 the
 did
 it


work,
 how
 well
 did
 it
 work,
 you
 know,


what
 are
 the
 measurements,
 make
 sure


that
 the
 measurements
 don't
 become


targets,
 like
 all
 the
 stuff
 that
 we
 just


talked
 about.
 And
 then
 to
 use
 the


metaphor
 of
 my
 my
 son
 who
 cheated
 on
 his


math
 homework,
 um
 there
 are
 people
 that


are
 just
 like,
 "Wow,
 like
 they're


they're
 the
 go-getters
 in
 the
 company."


This
 is
 actually
 why
 I
 am
 convinced
 that


AI
 is
 underhyped.
 Yes.
 You
 know,
 we
 have


our
 little
 group
 chat
 where
 we
 have


another
 friend
 who's
 like, "Oh,
 all
 this


stuff
 is
 overhyped
 and
 it's
 going
 to


zero."


>> Totally.
 Every
 time
 I
 use
 AI,
 it's


amazing


>> because
 you
 go,
 it
 doesn't
 it
 has
 not


diffused.
 you
 you
 have
 like
 the


19-year-old
 kid
 or
 you
 know
 my
 my


13-year-old
 son
 I
 was
 like
 wow
 normally


homework
 would
 take
 me
 two
 hours
 right


>> now
 it
 takes
 me
 one
 second
 right
 and


obviously
 that's
 bad
 right
 like
 I'm
 not


using
 him
 as
 the
 uh
 that's
 why
 we


confiscated
 his
 iPhone
 right
 but


>> there
 are
 these
 productivity
 unlocks


where
 it's
 probably
 not
 going
 to
 happen


top
 down


>> sure


>> it's
 like
 somebody
 in
 the
 company
 and


sometimes
 again
 I
 I
 not
 to
 like


oversimplify
 human
 behavior
 but
 it's


like
 I
 want
 to
 be
 lazy
 and
 I
 want
 to
 be


rich
 yes


>> right
 like
 these
 are
 the
 two
 things
 that


are
 motivating
 people
 and
 like
 I
 found


this
 tool
 that
 allows
 me
 to
 be
 lazier


and
 richer
 that
 actually
 helps
 the


company.
 Yes.
 So
 not
 the
 math,
 not
 the


cheating,
 right?
 It's
 like
 you're


getting
 like
 I
 can
 now
 I
 know
 that
 my


boss
 was
 thinking
 this
 would
 take
 eight


hours.
 I've
 figured
 out
 a
 way
 to
 do
 it


in
 5
 seconds


>> and
 it's
 really
 good
 by
 the
 way.


>> It's
 really
 good.
 And
 the
 worst
 thing


that
 can
 happen
 this
 is
 like
 the
 inverse


of
 everything
 that
 we
 just
 talked
 about.


The
 worst
 thing
 that
 can
 happen
 is
 that


guy
 keeps
 it
 a
 secret.


>> Right.


>> Right.
 Because
 like
 and
 and
 he
 might
 be


afraid.
 It's
 like,
 oh,
 am
 I
 allowed
 to


use
 this?
 But
 what
 you
 should
 do,
 this


is
 how
 AI
 will
 go
 from
 underhyped
 to


like
 correctly
 hyped
 um
 and
 correctly


diffused
 is
 it's
 like
 there's
 somebody


at
 every
 big
 company
 who
 has
 figured
 out


this
 like
 I
 could
 do
 something
 in
 one


minute
 that
 used
 to
 take
 eight
 hours.
 We


need
 to
 like
 make
 this
 person
 a
 hero,


memorialize
 this
 and
 push
 it
 out
 through


the
 entire
 company.
 So
 like
 how
 do
 you


do
 that?


>> This
 was
 my
 point
 on
 the
 uh
 what
 we're


doing
 on
 the
 AI
 engagement
 side
 and
 that


that's
 that's
 a
 great
 question.
 This
 is


my
 point
 on
 what
 we're
 doing
 on
 the
 A


engagement
 side.
 This
 is
 one
 of these


areas
 where
 everyone's
 interests
 are


aligned.
 The
 employee
 that's
 working


very
 hard
 loves
 recognition.
 And
 by
 the


way,
 he'd
 like
 his
 co-workers
 to
 come
 up


to
 speed.
 Um
 the
 employee
 that's
 scared


wants
 support
 and
 wants
 training.
 And
 by


the
 way,
 companies
 actually
 want
 their


employees
 to
 be
 more
 productive.
 I
 know


it's
 a
 fun
 thing
 for
 a
 subset
 of
 people


to
 tweet
 about,
 but
 like
 I
 said,
 I
 have


yet
 to
 find
 the
 CEO
 in
 all
 of
 I've
 spent


30
 years
 selling
 things
 to
 CEOs.
 I've


yet
 to
 find
 the
 CEO
 who
 wakes
 up
 in
 the


morning
 and
 wants
 to
 run
 a
 smaller


company.
 He
 wants
 more
 employees
 and
 he


wants
 more
 profit.
 He
 wants
 more


revenue.
 But
 contrary
 to
 popular
 belief,


they
 want
 more
 employees.
 They
 like


running
 big
 companies.
 They
 do.
 You
 can


find
 old
 interviews
 of
 Larry
 Page


talking
 about
 his
 plan
 for
 how
 Google


was
 going
 to
 have
 a
 million
 employees


one
 day.
 And
 he
 was
 spending
 a
 lot
 of


time
 thinking
 about
 self-driving
 cars
 to


move
 the
 cars
 around
 the
 parking
 lot


because
 this
 is
 before
 remote
 work.


>> And
 literally
 where
 were
 the
 million


employees
 going
 to
 park
 all
 the
 cars?


And
 I
 remember
 I
 read
 that
 15
 years
 ago


like
 that
 stuck
 in
 the
 back
 of
 my
 mind


of
 I
 have
 never
 met
 a
 CEO
 who
 wants
 to


run
 a
 smaller
 company.
 It's
 one
 of
 the


reasons
 by
 the
 way
 totally
 unrelated


point
 in
 the
 capital
 markets.
 One
 of the


reasons
 if
 you
 ever
 meet
 a
 CEO
 of
 a


conglomerate
 they
 never
 want
 to
 break
 up


the
 conglomerate
 because
 they
 like


running
 bigger
 companies.
 It's
 more
 fun


right?
 I've
 run
 I've
 had
 my
 companies


grow.
 They're
 fun
 when
 they're
 bigger.


It
 is
 it's
 super
 cool.
 And
 so
 from
 an


employee
 standpoint,
 what
 we
 built
 with


this
 Nexus
 product
 is
 effectively
 a


product
 where
 we
 said
 or
 I'll
 I'll
 I'll


use
 an
 anecdote.
 I
 was
 in
 the
 UK
 in
 July


uh
 and
 uh
 I
 went
 on
 a
 bunch
 of
 sales


calls
 and
 I
 was
 talking
 to
 someone
 at
 a


bank
 very
 large
 very
 reg
 European
 bank


is
 among
 the
 most
 regulated
 folks
 in
 the


world
 least
 you
 know
 fast
 to
 adopt
 new


technology
 for
 for
 good
 reasons
 honestly


and
 they
 were
 telling
 me
 a
 story
 about


how
 they
 had
 it
 was
 a
 28-y
 old
 guy
 I


don't
 remember
 what
 level
 that
 makes
 you


an
 investment
 bank
 so
 let's
 say
 a


director
 but
 I
 don't
 28-y
 old
 guy
 who


was
 using
 chat
 GPT
 really
 really
 well
 in


the
 investment
 banking
 side
 of
 the
 and


they
 had
 him
 create
 a
 30
 slide
 deck
 and


they
 did
 a
 global
 call
 for
 everyone
 in


the
 investment
 bank
 for
 this
 guy
 to


spend
 an
 hour
 walking
 people
 through
 how


to
 use
 chatbt.
 I'm
 sure
 that
 was
 very


cool
 for
 him,
 but
 that's
 absurd.
 That's


an
 absurd
 way
 to
 hope
 people
 adopt


worldchanging
 technology.
 Another
 absurd


thing
 to
 do
 is
 to
 go
 out
 and
 buy
 some


LMS
 course
 that
 HR
 is
 going
 to
 buy
 that


you
 know
 the
 secret
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 LMS
 is


other
 than
 things
 you
 must
 do
 or
 you


will
 lose
 your
 job
 like
 sexual


harassment
 training,
 HIPPA
 training
 and


certain
 or
 no
 one
 no
 one
 does
 it.
 They


they
 just
 don't
 go.
 And
 so
 how
 do
 I


actually
 get
 people
 using
 these
 tools


and
 this
 was
 my
 point
 from
 earlier
 is


you
 want
 to
 help
 them
 a
 not
 look
 dumb


and
 b
 know
 they
 won't
 get
 fired.
 And
 so


what
 we
 effectively
 did
 is
 built
 these


wrappers
 that
 exist
 around
 the
 models.


So
 we
 don't
 tell
 people
 to
 use
 quaude
 or


to
 use
 Gemini
 or
 to
 use
 catchy
 fatigue.


Then
 the
 other
 thing
 we
 built
 because


again
 people
 are
 also
 worried
 about


getting
 fired.
 They're
 worried
 about


getting
 fired
 because
 the
 economy


because
 of
 AI
 because
 whatever
 it's
 a


new
 tool
 I
 would
 like
 to
 not
 get
 fired.


By
 the
 way
 when
 you're
 talking
 about


European
 banks
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


regulation
 that
 is
 a
 legitimate
 concern


of
 if
 our
 employees
 do
 the
 wrong
 thing


we
 will
 get
 fined.
 Forget
 whether
 you


fire
 them.
 These
 companies
 don't
 want
 to


get
 fined.
 And
 so
 the
 other
 thing
 we
 did


is
 we
 we
 basically
 trained
 our
 own
 kind


of
 customized
 llama
 model
 to
 block


people
 from
 asking
 questions
 that
 are


illegal
 or
 the
 company
 doesn't
 want
 you


to.
 So
 we're
 not
 talking
 about
 hackers


here.
 True
 bad
 actors
 in
 the
 company
 has


plenty
 of
 security
 solutions.
 What
 we're


really
 talking
 about
 is
 the
 x%
 of
 the


people
 who
 I'm
 in
 people
 ops
 in
 HR
 at
 a


large
 company.
 I'm
 supposed
 to
 do
 a


workforce
 analysis.
 Am
 I
 allowed
 to
 go


into
 chat
 GPT
 and
 load
 in
 our
 full


employee
 database
 with
 race
 and
 gender?


I
 don't
 know.
 I
 would
 like
 to
 not
 get


fired.
 Maybe
 I'm
 allowed
 to
 and
 maybe


I'm
 not.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 I
 think
 it's


incumbent
 on
 the
 company
 to
 say
 to
 our


employees,
 here
 is
 a
 safe
 space.
 Nothing


you
 can
 do
 here
 is
 going
 to
 get
 you


fired.
 So
 we
 Oh,
 Alex,
 you're
 not


allowed
 to
 up
 that
 has
 social
 security


data.
 Don't
 don't
 share
 that.
 You're
 not


allowed
 to
 ask
 that
 prompt
 because
 in


Europe,
 we're
 not
 allowed
 to
 use
 HR.


We're
 not
 allowed
 to
 use
 AI
 to
 write


employee
 reviews.
 I
 don't know
 if
 that's


a
 good
 law
 or
 bad
 law.
 I
 I
 didn't
 write


the
 law.
 But
 there
 are
 companies
 that


look
 at
 the
 EU
 AI
 regulations
 and
 say
 to


themselves,
 our
 read
 of
 the
 regulation,


I'm
 not
 going
 to,
 you
 know,
 prosecute


that.
 Our
 read
 of
 the
 regulation
 is
 we


believe
 it's
 illegal
 and
 we
 will
 get


fined
 if
 our
 employees
 use
 AI
 tools
 to


do
 employee
 reviews.
 So
 great,
 if
 I
 am
 a


European-based
 company,
 I
 want
 my


employees
 using
 AI,
 I
 have
 to
 block
 them


from
 using
 it
 for
 those
 use
 cases.
 And


so
 what
 we've
 tried
 to
 build
 is
 this


almost
 like
 harness
 to
 say
 you
 can
 be


more
 productive.
 you're
 not
 going to


look
 dumb,
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 more


productive,
 and
 you're
 not
 going
 to
 make


any
 mistakes
 that
 get
 you
 fired.
 And
 so


what
 we
 found
 is
 that
 actually
 drives


more
 AI
 usage,
 surprising
 literally
 no


one.
 And
 from
 a
 company
 standpoint,
 what


do
 you
 want?
 A,
 I
 want
 the
 usage,
 and
 B,


I
 want
 to
 build
 up
 that
 IP
 of
 what


really
 works
 my
 company.
 It's
 a
 total


unlock.
 Same
 thing
 on
 the
 coding
 side,


right?
 Uh,
 you
 know,
 cursor
 has
 taken


mediocre
 engineers
 and
 made
 them
 good,


but
 it's
 taken
 amazing
 engineers
 and


made
 them
 gods,
 right?
 And
 so
 our
 goal


should
 be
 how
 do
 we
 help
 people
 get
 much


more
 productive
 with
 all
 of
 this?
 How
 do


we
 help
 them
 use
 Kurser
 more


effectively,
 Harvey
 more
 effectively?
 We


started
 with
 all
 of
 the
 LLMs
 more


effectively.


>> Yeah.
 Um
 so
 maybe
 we
 could
 talk
 I
 mean


this
 is
 a
 little
 bit
 philosophical
 but


future
 of
 work.
 Um
 because
 to
 a
 certain


extent
 like
 all
 right
 you're
 you're
 the


me
 like
 if
 you're
 the
 measurement


>> sure


>> like
 the
 measurement
 inevitably
 will


become
 a
 little
 bit
 more
 of
 a
 target.


Um,
 and
 I
 I
 always
 like
 to
 kind
 of


remind
 people
 that
 I
 think
 it
 was
 97
 98%


of
 Americans
 when
 the
 Constitution
 was


ratified
 were
 farmers


>> and
 they
 all
 lost
 their
 jobs
 um
 due
 to


these
 pesky
 things
 like
 the
 tractor
 and


fertilizer
 and
 all
 these
 things
 and
 I


think
 the
 the
 average
 life
 expectancy


was
 like
 35
 and
 most
 children
 died
 in


childirth
 or
 shortly
 thereafter.
 It's


like
 you
 know
 we
 things
 have
 changed
 but


this
 is
 what
 uh
 this
 is
 what
 technology


brings
 you.
 Um,
 I
 mean,
 nobody
 knows
 the


answer
 to
 this,
 but
 given
 that
 you're


you're
 in
 char
 you're
 in
 charge
 of
 a


company
 that's
 measuring
 AI
 productivity


and
 human
 productivity
 and
 kind
 of
 AI


and
 humans
 working
 together,
 I
 mean,


what
 what's
 your
 timetable
 for
 like
 how


fast
 things
 change?
 Are
 we
 going
 to
 see,


you
 know,
 net
 new
 jobs
 create
 like
 every


and
 by
 the
 way,
 like
 behind
 every
 one
 of


these,
 there
 are
 all
 sorts
 of
 jobs
 that


start
 becoming
 around
 that
 didn't
 exist


before.
 So
 maybe
 that's
 kind
 of
 part
 two


of
 the
 question
 because
 like
 the
 job


that
 we
 have
 right
 now
 like
 you
 know


filming
 a
 podcast
 like
 that
 wasn't
 a
 job


like
 200
 years
 like
 there's
 so
 many
 jobs


that
 just
 like
 nobody
 could
 even
 think


of.
 So
 so
 I
 guess
 like
 where
 do
 you


think
 things
 are
 going
 and
 like
 what


types
 of
 maybe
 to
 put
 a
 nuance
 on
 it


like
 what
 types
 of
 like
 future
 jobs
 do


you
 see
 in
 and
 around
 this
 like
 new


stuff?


>> So
 I
 don't
 buy
 for
 a
 second
 there's


going
 to
 be
 large
 scale
 job
 loss
 because


of
 AI
 frankly
 because
 of
 what
 we've
 seen


through
 all
 of
 history
 which
 is
 just


flatout
 capitalism.


If
 my
 two
 choices
 are
 I
 can
 maintain
 my


base
 level
 of
 productivity
 but
 fire
 a


bunch
 of
 my
 employees
 and
 be
 more


profitable
 that
 is
 a
 fine
 idea
 in
 the


short
 term
 if
 I'm
 there's
 probably
 a


good
 idea
 for
 a
 PE
 firm
 to
 go
 along
 go


around
 and
 buy
 a
 bunch
 of
 minorly


profitable
 companies
 fire
 half
 their


employees
 and
 make
 them
 more
 profitable


but
 that's
 what
 PE
 firms
 have
 done
 for
 a


long
 time
 for
 non-competitive
 companies


anyway
 yet
 employment
 has
 still


increased
 right
 so
 you
 can
 argue
 we've


always
 had
 a
 function
 or
 for
 the
 last
 40


years
 you
 can
 argue
 we've
 had
 a
 function


whose
 goal
 is
 to
 take
 underperforming


companies
 and
 fire
 a
 bunch
 of
 employees,


right?
 And
 let's
 let's
 say
 that
 that's


what
 PE
 firms
 have
 done
 and
 that's
 you


know
 what
 AI
 could
 theoretically
 do
 yet


employment
 has
 increased.
 So
 I
 I
 don't


buy
 an
 AI
 and
 look
 it's
 philosophical


and
 you
 know
 I
 don't
 have
 any
 special


expertise
 because
 I
 am
 building
 a


measurement
 company
 but
 I
 don't
 buy
 it


because
 your
 competitor
 across
 the


street
 is
 not
 going
 to
 fire
 all
 those


employees.
 He's
 just
 going
 to
 do
 more


with
 those
 employees
 and
 he's
 going
 to


kill
 your
 business.
 Right?
 I
 mean
 this


is
 the
 um
 Jeff
 Bezos
 your
 margin
 is
 my


opportunity
 line
 to
 the
 extent
 that
 AI


is
 going
 to
 drive
 up
 your
 margin
 that


will
 be
 all
 of
 your
 competitor's


opportunity
 to
 be
 less
 profitable
 and


compete
 with
 you.
 So
 it
 other
 than
 some


very
 niche
 monopolistic
 I
 can
 fire


everybody
 you
 know
 oneman
 firm
 like
 will


we
 have
 onewoman
 firms
 that
 do
 a
 billion


in
 revenue
 probably
 but
 today
 we
 have


very
 profitable
 you
 know
 one
 man


onewoman
 operations
 not
 many
 people
 work


at
 the
 Joe
 Rogan
 podcast
 I
 I
 don't
 think


that
 many
 people
 work
 for
 Ben
 Thompson


Incorporated
 and
 yet
 I
 imagine
 those
 are


quite
 profitable
 businesses
 the
 best
 I


can
 tell
 so
 that
 that
 that's
 amazing
 and


there'll
 be
 a
 ton
 of
 opportunity
 to
 be


more
 successful
 solo
 entrepreneur
 so
 I


absolutely
 believe
 there'll
 be
 even
 more


entrepreneurs,
 but
 at
 a
 very
 high
 level,


I
 just
 don't
 believe
 the
 Fortune
 500


will
 employ
 fewer
 people
 in
 30
 years


than
 they
 do
 today
 because
 the
 ones
 that


try
 and
 cut
 all
 the
 people
 will
 no


longer
 be
 in
 the
 Fortune
 500.
 So,
 I
 just


flatly
 because
 we
 live
 in
 a
 competitive


world.
 It's
 we
 haven't
 seen
 any
 proof


yet.


>> Yeah.


>> That
 the
 economy
 is
 zero
 sum,
 right?


Maybe,
 right?
 You
 can
 argue
 that,
 but
 we


haven't
 seen
 any
 proof
 yet.
 GDP
 keeps


increasing.
 It
 increases
 slower
 in
 some


places
 and
 faster
 in
 other
 places,
 but


it's
 generally
 grown.
 employment
 has


generally
 grown.
 I
 just
 don't
 know
 why


you'd
 believe
 that
 this
 time
 is


different
 because
 the
 competitive
 point


of
 view
 I
 the
 tech
 is
 different.
 The


tech
 is
 amazing.
 But
 fundamentally
 what


will
 almost
 definitively
 happen.
 There


is
 an
 interesting
 theoretical
 question


that
 you
 know
 is
 more
 like
 a
 you
 know
 I


don't
 know
 Ivy
 League
 grad
 school
 you


know
 discussion
 about
 wouldn't
 it
 be


more
 fun
 as
 a
 society?
 Wouldn't
 we
 all


be
 happier
 if
 everyone
 agreed
 we'd
 work


half
 as
 much
 and
 be
 just
 as
 productive


as
 we
 are
 today?
 I
 don't
 know,
 maybe.


But
 that's
 not
 human
 nature,
 right?
 And


so,
 I'm
 not
 even
 sure
 that's
 true.
 I
 I


tend
 to
 believe
 in
 the
 Tyler
 Cowan
 point


that
 all
 that
 really
 matters
 is
 growth.


And
 so,
 my
 general
 perspective
 is


you
 as
 a
 VC
 would
 just
 never
 get
 excited


if
 one
 of
 your
 companies
 came
 in
 here


and
 said,
 "Hey,
 we
 got
 to
 100
 million
 in


revenue."
 And
 you
 know what?
 because
 AI


tools
 are
 so
 good,
 we're
 going
 to
 fire


90%
 of
 our
 employees
 and
 we're
 going
 to


make
 90
 million
 in
 profit.
 You
 would
 not


be
 excited
 with
 that
 entrepreneur


because
 you
 know
 that
 Sequoia
 is
 going


to
 fund
 a
 direct
 competitor
 to
 that


company
 who's
 going
 to
 keep
 hiring,


who's
 going
 to
 be
 happy
 with
 10%
 margins


and
 is
 going
 to
 destroy
 your
 company.


And
 we
 we
 all
 know
 this.
 So
 I
 I
 don't


it's
 one
 of
 these
 things
 of
 like,


>> you
 know,
 there's
 a
 lot
 of
 fun
 headlines


about
 oh
 AI
 and
 then
 you
 have
 to
 have


the
 counterpoint
 of
 oh
 it's
 going
 to


take
 the
 jobs
 and
 oh
 kids
 these
 days.


I
 don't
 know
 like
 when
 you
 we
 all
 know


this
 we've
 all
 seen
 this
 you
 can
 find


articles
 about
 when
 TV
 came
 out
 it
 was


the
 end
 of
 reading
 when
 newspapers
 came


out
 it
 was
 the
 end
 of
 conversation
 so
 I


do
 think
 it
 is
 scary
 that
 new
 tools
 are


coming
 out
 and
 it
 is
 impacting
 the


entire
 globe
 of
 all
 knowledge
 workers


everywhere


so
 what
 so
 I
 think
 there'll
 be


opportunities
 to
 be
 podcasters
 there


probably
 will
 be
 more
 plumbers
 there


will
 be
 a
 lot
 more
 employment
 around


building
 data
 centers
 right
 there's


going
 to
 be
 a
 whole
 set
 of
 engineers


maybe
 we
 will
 need
 a
 lot
 more


astronauts.
 Elon
 says
 we're
 going
 to


Mars.
 Like,
 someone
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to


scrub
 the
 toilets
 in
 the
 space
 station


and
 someone
 is
 going
 to
 have
 to
 pilot


the
 plane,
 the
 pilot
 the
 ship
 to
 the


space
 station.


>> The
 self-driving


self-driving
 spaceships.
 Um,


>> so
 by
 the
 way,
 there
 is
 a
 chance
 I
 will


turn
 out
 to
 be
 wrong.
 And
 in
 that
 case,


I
 don't
 know,
 maybe
 I'll
 spend
 more
 time


on
 vacation.


>> Well,
 it's
 interesting.
 Uh,
 I
 I
 talked


to
 this
 economist
 Ed
 Glazier.
 Um,
 I


think
 he's
 at
 Harvard
 and
 he
 was
 saying


uh
 I
 I
 asked
 him
 this
 question.
 It's


like,
 you
 know,
 what's
 going
 to
 happen


with
 jobs
 and,
 you
 know,
 how
 do
 you


compare
 this
 to
 everything
 else?
 It's


like,
 well,
 what's
 really
 interesting
 is


that
 this
 is
 arguably
 the
 first
 time


that
 the
 job
 losses
 might
 be
 borne
 by


like
 white
 collar
 super
 educated.


>> That's
 why
 everybody
 gets
 scared.


>> Well,
 but
 but
 so
 he
 actually
 had
 a


different
 framing
 on
 it.
 So,
 so
 yes,


agreed.


>> But,
 uh,
 almost
 tautologically


hypereducated
 people
 are
 hypereducated.


Sure.


>> So,
 should
 be
 able
 to
 rejigger


themselves
 and
 do
 something
 else.


versus
 in
 all
 of
 these
 previous


revolutions
 where
 it's
 like
 you
 have


somebody
 that
 really
 has
 no
 skills,


right?


>> And
 just
 like
 showed
 up
 at
 work
 with
 no


skills
 and
 got
 paid.


>> Yes.


>> And
 there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 jobs
 that
 look


like
 that
 when
 there's
 tremendous
 labor


shortages.
 So
 if
 you
 were
 doing
 anything


in
 1849
 apparently
 in
 California,
 like


boom,
 right?
 Right.
 It's
 like
 there's


just
 like,
 oh,
 you're
 a
 human.
 You
 have


a
 need
 someone
 with
 a
 pitch
 like
 go
 do


this
 or
 just
 like
 you
 know
 you
 see
 that


line
 over
 there
 like
 uh
 yeah
 like


straighten
 it
 out.
 So
 um
 but
 what's


different
 is
 that
 you
 yes
 it's
 scary
 for


some
 people
 but
 like
 everything
 right


now
 and
 maybe
 robots
 will
 work
 better
 in


the
 future
 but
 like
 everything
 right
 now


is
 bit
 manipulation
 going
 after
 or


augmenting
 I
 would
 argue
 more
 augmenting


white
 collar
 hypereducated
 people
 by


virtue
 of
 the
 fact
 that
 they're


hypereducated
 um
 it
 might
 not
 like
 this


does
 not
 mean
 that
 like
 you
 know
 what


what
 happened
 to
 Detroit
 right
 it's
 like


that
 that
 actually
 wasn't
 about


automation
 that
 was
 about
 like
 the


Japanese
 built
 better
 cars.
 There
 were
 a


lot
 of
 reasons
 why
 that
 happened.
 But


what
 do
 you
 do
 with
 somebody
 who
 had


like
 a
 very
 very
 highpaying
 job
 but


actually
 didn't
 have
 that
 many
 skills


and
 now
 they
 lost
 that
 job?
 Well,


because
 they
 don't
 have
 any
 skills,
 they


can't
 find
 another
 job.
 Whereas,
 if
 you


are
 highly
 skilled,
 you
 will
 find


something
 else
 to
 do.
 And
 I
 do
 think


there's
 an
 element
 of
 look,
 there
 are


certainly
 a
 set
 of
 people
 who
 were


pretty
 highly
 educated.
 They
 were
 in


good
 classes.
 They
 got
 into
 a
 good


school,
 whatever
 that
 meant.
 They
 got
 a


good
 job.
 They
 worked
 pretty
 hard
 in


their
 20s,
 a
 little
 less
 hard
 in
 their


30s,
 and
 a
 little
 less
 hard
 in
 their


40s,
 but
 they're
 paid
 pretty
 well.
 And


those
 people
 probably
 are
 a
 little


uncomfortable
 today
 because
 their


career,
 frankly,
 there's
 there's
 some


professions
 that
 just
 require
 continuing


ed
 education.
 By
 the
 way,
 if
 you're
 an


electrician
 or
 a
 plumber
 or
 a
 doctor
 or


a
 lawyer,
 some
 of
 these
 professions
 just


require
 constant
 upkeep
 and
 constant


education.
 That's
 not
 true
 in
 a
 lot
 of


professions.
 There
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 jobs


where
 you
 get
 to
 40
 or
 50
 and
 you
 can


keep
 doing
 a
 good
 job,
 but
 you
 don't


really
 have
 to
 learn
 much
 new.
 You
 you


can
 just
 keep
 doing
 a
 good
 job
 doing


what
 you're
 doing
 and
 you
 don't
 have
 to


learn
 much
 new.
 And
 that's
 probably


quite
 uncomfortable.
 I
 I
 acknowledge
 it


is
 quite
 uncomfortable
 for
 those
 people.


But
 to
 your
 point,
 they're
 educated.


They
 have
 skills.
 We
 have
 much
 more
 of
 a


knowledge
 economy.
 So
 I
 don't


necessarily
 have
 the
 issue
 of
 I


literally
 I
 have
 this
 house
 in
 Detroit.


The
 jobs
 are
 now
 in
 Knoxville,
 right?


Forget
 Japan.
 The
 jobs
 are
 now
 in


Knoxville.
 I
 don't
 want
 to
 move
 to


Knoxville,
 right?
 We
 all
 know
 the
 data


on
 mobility
 and
 housing
 costs
 and
 all


that.
 So
 sure,


>> but
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day,
 to
 your


point,
 yes,
 there's
 a
 set
 of
 people


who've
 probably
 been
 slowly
 working
 less


and
 pushing
 themselves
 less,
 and
 now


they
 have
 to
 push
 themselves
 more.
 And


that
 just
 is
 I
 my
 joke
 all
 the
 time
 I
 I


won't
 say
 the
 company
 I
 use
 but
 part
 of


my
 sales
 pitch
 for
 Laridan
 when
 I'm


talking
 about
 this
 I
 say
 look
 when
 we


talk
 to
 employees
 you
 know
 look
 your


average
 employee
 is
 a
 42-year-old


associate
 brand
 manager
 and
 if
 you
 ask


them
 what
 they
 want
 out
 of
 AI
 they
 do


want
 it
 to
 go
 away
 their
 number
 one
 risk


wish
 would
 be
 that
 it
 would
 just
 go
 away


I'd
 like
 that
 I
 because
 I
 like
 yesterday


but
 we'd
 make
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 if
 we
 had


the
 power
 to
 make
 AI
 go
 away
 super
 big


blackmail
 business
 but
 we
 don't
 have


that
 power
 so
 all
 we
 can
 do
 is
 give
 you


the
 tools
 to
 use
 these
 things
 better
 and


help
 you
 be
 more
 productive
 and
 help
 you


as
 a
 manager
 understand
 if
 your
 team
 is


using
 these
 tools
 better
 and
 so
 you
 know


my
 macro
 point
 is
 I
 just
 don't
 really


believe
 there
 will
 be
 widescale
 mass


unemployment


might
 an
 individual
 have
 to
 push


themselves
 more
 yeah
 for
 for
 sure
 and


some
 of
 those
 will
 be
 sad
 about
 that
 and


like
 um
 that
 same
 thing
 is
 true
 in
 the


entertainment
 industry
 right
 that
 that


jobs
 have
 moved
 and
 jobs
 have
 shifted


and
 people
 don't
 watch
 movies
 the
 way


they
 used
 to
 and
 you
 know
 TV
 seasons


used
 to
 be
 22
 episodes
 and
 now
 they're


because
 consumer
 preferences
 have


changed


a
 part
 on
 law
 and
 order,
 right?
 That


probably
 is
 uncomfortable.
 I'm
 not
 being


callous.
 Sure,
 there's
 many
 ways
 it
 will


impact
 my
 life
 negatively.
 But
 I
 I
 just


don't
 buy
 that
 they
 won't
 be
 more


educated.


>> Yeah.
 A
 lot
 of
 this
 actually
 predates


AI.
 Uh
 there
 there's
 this
 great
 uh


article
 or
 interview
 with
 the
 CEO
 of


Waste
 Management.
 Okay.


>> Before
 Chat
 GPD
 came
 out.
 Um,
 and
 he
 was


saying,
 "I
 have
 unlimited
 like
 I
 get


resumes
 every
 day
 from
 somebody
 who
 has


an
 MBA
 and
 wants
 to
 work
 like
 in
 our


office
 for
 and
 like
 the
 they're
 like


negotiating
 against
 themselves
 like
 the


price
 keeps
 going
 down
 there."
 Um,
 so


100
 jobs
 for
 100
 applications
 for
 every


opening
 or
 I
 forgot
 what
 he
 said.


>> I
 need
 to
 hire
 truck
 drivers.
 Uh,


somebody
 who
 and
 not
 just
 like


self-driving
 like
 I
 need
 somebody
 who


actually
 is
 collecting
 the
 trash.
 like


that's
 what
 waste
 management
 does
 for


$150,000
 a
 year.
 I
 can't
 find
 them.


>> So,
 it
 is
 kind
 of
 interesting
 how
 how


things
 have
 flipped.
 But
 I
 I
 guess
 the


other
 thing
 that
 I
 would
 say
 is
 uh
 I


would
 I
 would
 almost
 argue
 that
 a
 lot
 of


AI's
 problem
 right
 now
 in
 terms
 of


diffusing
 into
 the
 workplace.
 It's


almost
 a
 product
 marketing
 problem.


Sure.


>> Right.
 Where
 it's
 like,
 okay,
 AI
 can
 do


anything.
 Right.


>> Right.
 But
 I'm
 not
 looking
 for
 anything.


Like
 I
 say
 like,
 hey,
 I
 can
 do
 anything.


And
 you're
 like
 you're
 like
 I
 don't
 need


you.
 It's
 like
 no,
 I
 could
 do
 this
 one


thing
 very
 very
 oh
 you
 do
 that
 and
 and


like
 that
 that
 needs
 like
 this
 is
 kind


of
 I
 think
 once
 you
 have
 more
 of
 these


articulations
 of
 what
 can
 be
 done
 and


like
 the
 things
 that
 have
 really
 kind
 of


gone
 hyperrowth
 it's
 like
 oh
 like
 I
 have


AI
 it
 does
 everything
 oh
 I
 will
 help
 you


code


>> I will
 help
 you
 code
 better
 I
 have
 this


chatbot
 for
 yeah
 look
 a
 long
 long
 time


ago
 it's
 funny
 when
 you
 get
 old
 uh
 a


long
 long
 time
 ago
 I
 was
 like
 I
 said
 I


was
 the
 first
 guy
 at
 comscore
 and


comscore's
 sales
 pitch
 in
 the
 early


Comscore
 for
 those
 that
 don't
 know,


right,
 basically
 had
 all
 the
 data
 for


everything
 that
 was
 happening
 on
 the


internet.
 And
 so
 the
 founders
 were
 true


geniuses
 and
 they
 basically
 knew


everything
 that
 was
 happening
 everywhere


on
 the
 internet.
 And
 our
 sales
 pitch
 in


the
 early
 days
 would
 be
 we
 know


everything.
 I
 mean
 obviously
 not,
 but


would
 it
 basically
 be
 like
 we
 know


everything.
 What
 would
 you
 like
 to
 know?


And
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 wasn't
 a
 really


good
 sales
 pitch.
 You
 would
 sometimes


accidentally
 run
 into
 someone
 who
 would


go
 oh
 my
 god
 I
 need
 to
 know
 this.
 Could


you
 do
 this?
 And
 we'd
 say
 yes
 we
 could


and
 there
 you
 go.
 But
 it
 turned
 out
 we


only
 had
 a
 couple
 sellers
 that
 could


figure
 that
 out
 in
 real
 time.
 And
 then


it
 turned
 out
 if
 we
 said
 we
 can
 tell
 you


the
 market
 share
 for
 Visa
 verse


Mastercard
 verse
 others
 in
 Japan.
 Turns


out
 Visa
 really
 wants
 to
 know
 that.
 But


I
 can
 also
 tell
 you
 the
 share
 for
 your


pharmaceutical
 drug
 versus
 others
 in


research
 online.
 Turns
 out
 they
 also


want
 to
 know
 that.
 Uh
 after


>> I'm
 gonna
 get
 it
 wrong,
 but
 Ford
 had


some
 giant
 issue
 with
 Bridgestone
 tires


setting
 on
 fire.
 It
 turns
 out
 they


really
 do
 want
 to
 know
 that
 did


employees
 did
 search
 for
 forward
 get


worse
 because
 of
 bridge
 home,
 right?
 So


people
 do
 want
 to
 know
 these
 specific


like
 I
 said
 I
 I
 think
 that's
 exactly
 the


right
 way
 to
 think
 about
 it
 is
 you
 need


this
 product
 marketing
 problem.
 Look,


it's
 why
 we're
 so
 focused
 on
 what's


happening.
 Are
 they
 more
 productive?
 How


do
 you
 get
 them
 to
 use
 it
 more?
 We
 can


actually
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 but
 you


can't
 sell
 things
 that
 way.
 And
 that's


that's
 more
 like
 general


entrepreneurally
 advice,
 but
 it
 turns


out
 building
 something
 amazing
 that


people
 don't
 know
 how
 to
 use
 mostly


doesn't
 work
 unless
 it
 does,
 which
 is


chat
 GPT,
 right?
 So,
 one
 in
 a
 million


times
 it
 does
 work
 out.
 Facebook
 chat


>> GP
 there.
 It's
 just
 like
 it's
 magic.
 If


you
 show
 somebody
 a
 magic
 trick
 or
 you


get
 somebody
 addicted,
 right?
 Um,
 and


you'll
 guess
 which
 one
 I'm
 referring
 to


for
 for
 which,
 but
 um,
 the
 if
 you
 ever


watch
 Seinfeld,
 y
 there's
 this
 great


episode
 where
 Jerry
 buys
 his
 father
 a


Sharp
 Wizard,
 which
 was
 like
 an
 early


Palm
 Pilot
 kind.
 It
 was
 like
 this
 early


smart
 computer
 like
 in
 the
 1990s.
 Never


went
 on
 to
 to
 great
 things,
 but
 it
 did


everything.
 It
 was
 like,
 you
 know,
 he


could
 run
 these
 applications.
 And


Jerry's
 trying
 to
 explain
 it
 to
 his
 dad,


and
 he's
 like,
 "Well,
 I
 I
 don't
 get
 it.


What
 does
 it
 do?"
 He's
 like, "Well,
 like


look
 here.
 It
 has
 a
 tip
 calculator."


He's
 like, "Oh
 my
 god,
 a
 tip


calculator."
 And
 then
 he
 explains
 it
 to


all
 of
 his
 friends.
 He's
 like,
 "Look
 at


this.
 my
 my
 son,
 he's
 a
 comedian,
 he's


doing
 great.
 He
 got
 me
 a
 tip
 calculator


and
 Jerry's
 like, "No,
 it
 does
 other


things."


>> And
 it
 often
 ends
 up
 being
 frustrating


for
 the
 company
 that
 does
 the
 other


things
 because
 they
 aspire
 to
 have
 this


like
 more
 broad
 horizontal
 platform,
 but


what
 we
 kind
 of
 need
 is
 more
 of
 these
 uh


these
 tip
 calculator
 things.
 Um
 so
 I


know
 I
 know
 we're
 we're


>> Yes,
 thank
 you.
 But
 but
 actually
 why


don't
 we
 just
 uh
 is
 there
 anything
 that


we
 haven't
 talked
 about
 that
 you
 want
 to


get
 in
 like
 a
 little
 soliloquy
 that
 you


can
 uh


>> No,
 I
 look
 I
 think
 I'll
 leave
 you
 with


two
 thoughts.
 The
 one
 one
 related
 to


something
 you
 brought
 up
 in
 the


conversation
 and
 the
 professor
 but
 one


related
 to
 Laridan.
 So
 look
 my
 general


perspective
 is
 anytime
 you
 see
 some


giant
 shift
 in
 budget
 you're
 going
 to


build
 a
 set
 of
 very
 important
 but
 very


boring
 tools.
 What's
 actually
 happening?


Are
 people
 more
 productive?
 How
 do
 I
 get


them
 to
 use
 it
 more?
 And
 you
 know


there's
 there's
 a
 ton
 of
 business
 there.


And
 then
 I'll
 leave
 you
 with
 a
 leave
 you


with
 an
 unrelated
 thought
 to
 your
 to


your
 Harvard
 professor.
 So
 as
 you
 said


uh
 our
 kids
 go
 to
 the
 same
 school
 and
 uh


my
 oldest
 kid
 is
 in
 12th
 grade
 and
 just


got
 into
 college
 and
 he
 got
 into
 this


top
 choice
 and
 he's
 very
 proud
 of


himself
 and
 it's
 a
 very
 highly
 rated


school
 and
 I'm
 very
 happy
 for
 him.
 And


he
 came
 home
 and
 he
 said,
 "Dad,
 look
 at


this
 ranking."
 And
 he
 showed
 me
 the
 new


US
 News
 World
 Reports
 ranking
 that


showed
 the
 different
 rankings.
 And
 um


and
 I
 was
 like,
 his
 name's
 Henry.
 I


said,
 "Henry,
 I'm
 very
 proud
 of
 you.


There's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 lot
 of
 different


rankings
 over
 a
 lot
 of
 different
 years.


And
 there's
 only
 one
 thing
 you
 have
 to


know
 for
 sure.
 Whatever
 the
 ranking


says,
 everyone
 knows
 number
 one
 is


Harvard.
 And
 so
 it
 doesn't
 matter.
 Don't


get
 excited.
 Whatever
 it
 says,
 wherever


it
 puts
 your
 school,
 everyone
