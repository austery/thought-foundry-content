From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 I'm

Abrams

 this
 is

As
 the
 federal
 government
 reverses


course
 on
 renewable
 energy
 projects
 and


other
 policies
 related
 to
 climate


change,
 states,
 cities,
 and
 local
 groups


are
 stepping
 into
 the
 breach.


Today,
 my
 colleagues
 Cara
 Buckley
 and


Katherine
 Einhorn
 on
 their
 project
 to


document
 small
 but
 significant
 efforts


to
 solve
 climate
 and
 environmental


problems
 in
 every
 state
 in
 the
 country.

[Music]


It's
 Friday,
 January
 2nd.


Cara
 Katherine,
 happy
 new
 year.


>> Happy
 new
 year.


>> Happy
 new
 year.


>> The
 two
 of
 you
 just
 completed
 this


really
 big
 and
 ambitious
 series,
 50


states,
 50
 fixes.
 And
 I
 have
 to
 say
 it


is
 more,
 let's
 say,
 optimistic
 than
 the


types
 of
 stories
 we
 typically
 read
 in


our
 August
 pages.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 talk


about
 the
 origin
 of
 this.
 Tell
 me
 how


this
 series
 started.
 Cara,
 I'm
 going to


start
 with
 you.
 Right.
 So
 to
 answer
 your


question,
 I
 have
 to
 go
 back
 in
 time.
 I


used
 to
 be
 a
 culture
 reporter
 at
 the


paper.
 I
 was
 interviewing
 movie
 stars.
 I


was
 reporting
 on
 things
 like
 me
 too.
 But


throughout
 it
 all,
 especially
 in
 the


late
 2010s,
 I
 was
 finding
 it
 really
 hard


to
 process
 all
 the
 negative
 climate
 news


we
 were
 hearing
 about
 the
 planet


overheating,
 species
 crashing,
 etc.
 You


were
 having
 a
 personal
 struggle.


>> I
 was
 having
 a
 personal
 struggle
 and
 I


just
 really
 didn't
 understand
 how
 people


were
 coping
 with
 it.
 M


>> and
 I
 thought
 well
 what
 can
 we
 do?
 What


can
 I
 do?
 And
 so
 I
 thought
 maybe
 I
 can


report
 this
 out
 but
 in
 a
 way
 that


focused
 on
 all
 these
 efforts
 that
 people


were
 doing
 to
 try
 and
 reverse
 climate


change.
 You
 know
 things
 that
 were
 having


an
 impact
 because
 a
 lot
 of
 things
 can


have
 an
 impact.
 So
 in
 2021
 I
 joined
 the


climate
 desk
 and
 my
 focus
 from
 the
 start


was
 on
 people
 that
 were
 doing
 things
 in


their
 communities
 that
 were
 working


which
 is
 kind
 of
 unusual
 in
 the
 sense


that
 we
 normally
 think
 of
 journalism
 as


writing
 about
 problems
 not
 about


solutions.


>> Right?
 So
 this
 kind
 of
 beat
 is
 kind
 of


looking
 at
 you
 know
 not
 the
 plane


crashes
 but
 the
 planes
 that
 are
 not
 only


successfully
 landing
 but
 doing
 it
 really


well.


An
 early
 story
 I
 did
 was
 about
 people


taking
 over
 old
 golf
 courses
 and
 rewing


them,
 which
 was
 helping
 biodiversity.
 I


did
 stories
 about
 roundabouts
 in
 Carmel,


Indiana,
 which
 are
 the
 most
 sustainable


types
 of
 intersections
 and
 reduce


emissions.
 And
 it
 was
 out
 of
 that


reporting
 that
 I
 did
 over
 three
 years,
 I


thought
 there's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 solution


in
 every
 state.
 I
 was
 hearing
 about
 some


of
 them
 and
 I
 thought
 let's
 set


ourselves
 a
 challenge
 and
 also
 go
 and


find
 out
 a
 distinct
 climate
 or


environmental
 success
 story
 in
 each
 one


of
 the
 50
 states.
 And
 Katherine,
 I


remember
 us
 talking
 a
 few
 years
 ago


right
 after
 you
 joined
 the
 climate
 and


the
 environment
 desk.
 And
 I
 think
 you


were
 also
 kind
 of
 concerned
 about
 how
 to


write
 about
 this
 topic
 in
 a
 way
 that


wouldn't
 always
 hit
 that
 same
 note
 of


existential
 dread
 that
 Cara
 is
 talking


about.


>> Yeah.
 I
 remember
 setting
 a
 goal
 for


myself
 that
 I
 would
 include
 a
 solution


in
 the
 story
 somewhere.
 Even
 if
 it
 was
 a


little
 bit
 at
 the
 bottom,
 I
 would
 at


least
 say
 what
 the
 solution
 was
 in
 every


story
 that
 I
 wrote.
 I
 don't
 know if
 I


totally
 succeeded,
 but
 I
 tried.
 But
 I


came
 to
 the
 climate
 desk
 to
 cover


biodiversity,
 so
 wildlife
 and


ecosystems.
 I
 cover
 extinction,
 right?


So,
 when
 I
 first
 heard
 about
 CARA


series,
 it
 was
 in
 January
 2025


>> after
 the
 election,
 of
 course.
 And
 I
 was


really
 excited
 about
 it
 because
 we
 knew


that
 President
 Trump
 was
 going
 to
 be


dismantling
 a
 lot
 of
 climate
 policy,


environmental
 policy,
 environmental


regulation.
 I
 was
 so
 interested
 to
 focus


on
 the
 things
 that
 people
 will
 still
 be


doing,
 are
 doing,
 have
 been
 doing
 to


address
 things
 at
 the
 state,
 local,


tribal
 levels
 separately
 from
 the


federal
 government.
 I
 was
 really
 drawn


to
 this
 series
 because
 it
 seemed
 like


that's
 where
 a
 lot
 of
 the
 action
 was


going
 to
 be
 happening.
 So
 when
 you
 set


out
 to
 do
 this
 series,
 what
 was
 the


mandate?
 We
 wanted
 win-winwins.
 Multiple


wins.


>> Multiple
 wins.
 So
 it's
 not
 just


resilience.
 It's
 not
 just
 adaptation.


It's
 doing
 things
 that
 are
 reducing


greenhouse
 gas
 emissions
 that
 are
 making


ecosystems
 healthier
 that
 are
 helping


restore
 imperiled
 species.
 So
 we
 want
 at


the
 same
 time
 helping
 human
 health
 and


saving
 people
 money.
 Right.
 In
 a
 way


basically
 you're
 showing
 the


interconnectedness
 of
 our
 climate
 to
 our


economy
 to
 our
 health
 with
 the
 series.


It
 sounds
 like


>> precisely.


>> So
 at
 this
 point
 you
 have
 reported
 from


all
 50
 states.
 Congratulations.
 You
 have


traversed
 the
 country
 and


>> not
 just
 us
 to
 be
 fair.
 It
 wasn't
 just


the
 two
 of
 us.
 We
 had
 there
 was
 a
 whole


team
 of
 people
 that
 worked
 really
 hard


on
 this
 series
 including
 colleagues
 on


our
 desk
 and
 on
 national
 50
 plus


photographers.


>> 50
 plus
 photographers
 and
 13
 reporters.


>> Okay,
 that
 is
 cool.
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about


some
 of
 those
 stories.
 So
 let's
 start


with
 each
 of
 you
 telling
 me
 about
 one


that
 really
 stood
 out
 to
 you.
 maybe


because
 it
 had
 that
 multiple
 win
 or


downstream
 effects
 that
 you
 mentioned.


Cara,
 let's
 start
 with
 you.
 Yeah,


absolutely.
 So,
 one
 of
 the
 stories
 that


really
 popped
 for
 me
 was
 about
 a
 funeral


director
 in
 northwest
 Missouri.
 He
 lived


in
 one
 of
 the
 most
 rural
 counties
 in
 the


state.
 His
 name
 was
 Eric
 Chamberlain.
 He


runs
 a
 family
 funeral
 business.
 And
 he


had
 been
 worrying
 for
 a
 long
 time
 about


how
 his
 small
 town
 was
 getting
 smaller.


people
 were
 moving
 away
 and
 they
 weren't


coming
 back
 and
 he
 was
 just
 trying
 to


figure
 out
 like
 how
 could
 he
 help?
 Is


there
 anything
 to
 reverse
 the
 economic


misfortunes
 of
 the
 town?
 And
 he
 was
 at


work
 one
 day
 driving
 a
 hearse.
 He
 was


over
 the
 border
 in
 Iowa
 and
 he
 saw
 these


giant
 white
 blades
 of
 a
 wind
 turbine.


He'd
 never
 seen
 them
 before.
 He
 wanted


to
 pull
 over,
 but
 he
 was
 leading
 a


funeral
 procession
 so
 he
 did
 not.
 But
 he


began
 investigating
 it
 and
 he
 approached


the
 Department
 of
 Natural
 Resources
 at


the
 state
 and
 he
 said,
 "There's
 a
 lot
 of


wind
 in
 my
 neck
 of
 the
 woods.
 Can
 we


maybe
 look
 at
 putting
 in
 wind
 turbines


here?"
 He
 ended
 up
 setting
 in
 motion


this
 wind
 energy
 project.
 He
 convinced


local
 farmers
 to
 put
 wind
 turbines
 in


their
 fields.
 At
 first,
 there
 were
 just


four.
 And
 Eric
 told
 me
 he
 distinctly


remembers
 flipping
 on
 the
 switch
 in
 2008


and
 watching
 the
 town's
 electricity


meter
 running
 backwards.
 Rockport


announced
 it
 was
 the
 first
 community
 in


the
 country
 to
 be
 producing
 more


electricity
 from
 wind
 energy
 than
 what


it
 needed.
 And
 this
 ended
 up
 acrewing.


More
 places
 in
 the
 county
 started


putting
 up
 wind
 turbines.
 Today
 there's


more
 than
 340
 throughout
 the
 county.
 It


supplies
 50
 permanent
 jobs.
 And
 really


crucially,
 the
 town
 has


a
 tax
 revenue
 base
 from
 these
 wind


turbines.
 $6
 million
 a
 year.
 It's
 more


than
 half
 of
 the
 real
 estate
 tax
 revenue


for
 the
 county.
 And
 it's
 supplying
 extra


revenue
 for
 farmers
 who
 have
 wind


turbines,
 too.
 It
 fundamentally
 changed


the
 economy
 of
 this
 county.
 And
 it
 all


started
 with
 one
 guy.
 Wow.
 I
 want
 to


talk
 about
 one
 of
 the
 stories
 that


really
 stood
 out
 to
 me
 from
 your
 series.


I'm
 a
 dog
 person.
 This
 is
 a
 story
 where


dogs
 are
 the
 heroes.
 Can
 you
 guess
 which


one
 I'm
 talking
 about?


>> Montana.


>> Yes.
 Montana.
 You
 want
 to
 explain
 what


it
 is?


>> Yeah.
 Yeah.
 I
 knew
 that
 I
 wanted
 to


write
 about
 livestock
 guardian
 dogs,
 you


know,
 which
 are
 dogs
 that
 are
 bred
 to


protect
 livestock
 from
 predators
 like


coyotes


>> or
 grizzly
 bears


>> or
 grizzly
 bears
 in
 this
 case.
 And
 in


Montana,
 on
 the
 plains
 of
 Montana,
 they


have
 not
 been
 dealing
 with
 grizzly
 bears


for
 quite
 some
 time
 because
 because
 we


basically
 eradicated
 them
 from
 that


area.
 You
 know,
 they
 were
 eradicated


from
 much
 of
 the
 lower
 48
 states


>> because
 they're
 dangerous
 or


>> because
 they
 were
 shot.
 There
 were
 a
 lot


of
 predator
 campaigns
 in
 like
 the
 1800s


to
 early
 1900s
 and
 then
 laws
 were
 put


into
 place
 and
 these
 predators
 started


rebounding


>> to
 preserve
 them
 basically.
 So
 they


wouldn't
 go
 extinct.


>> So
 they
 wouldn't
 go
 extinct.
 Exactly.


And
 so
 these
 grizzlies
 have
 been
 slowly


walking
 back
 out
 to
 the
 plains
 of


Montana
 where
 there's
 no
 real


recollection
 of
 them
 in
 living
 memory.


And
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 they've


discovered
 is
 the
 wheat
 and
 barley


farms.
 And
 this
 is
 like
 really
 good


eating.
 If
 you're
 a
 grizzly
 bear,
 it's
 a


really
 nice,
 easy
 source
 of
 food
 for


them.
 And
 so
 these
 farmers,
 they
 never


had
 bears
 raiding
 their
 orchards.
 Now


all
 of
 a
 sudden
 there's
 bears
 stealing


their
 apples
 and
 raiding
 their
 grain


bins
 and
 they're
 scared
 to
 go
 outside,


certainly
 to
 let
 their
 children
 play


outside.
 And
 in
 Montana
 there's
 a
 man


named
 Wesley
 Sarmment
 who
 at
 the
 time


was
 the
 bear
 manager
 for
 the
 state


wildlife
 department.
 So
 he's
 getting
 all


these
 calls
 from
 these
 farmers
 who
 are


just
 desperate
 because
 these
 bears
 keep


showing
 up
 on
 their
 property.
 And


Wesley's
 trying
 everything
 to
 get
 them


to
 go
 away,
 including
 trapping
 them,
 but


that's
 dangerous.
 He
 tried
 having


everyone
 clean
 up
 the
 grain
 very
 well,


but
 it
 was
 impossible
 because
 they're
 on


a
 working
 farm.
 He
 tried
 electrifying


the
 grain
 bins,
 which
 did
 work,
 but
 it


was
 really
 bad
 for
 the
 farm
 workers
 cuz


it
 was
 just
 really
 awkward
 and
 made


working
 a
 lot
 harder.
 And
 so
 then
 he


heard
 about
 a
 local
 farmer
 whose
 son


found
 a
 stray
 livestock
 guardian
 dog,


like
 a
 Pyrenees
 type
 dog,
 you
 know,
 that


often
 put
 out
 like
 with
 sheep
 to
 protect


them
 from
 coyotes
 or
 whatever.
 And
 to


everyone's
 surprise,
 this
 dog
 was


chasing
 bears
 away,
 including
 like


mother
 bears
 with
 cubs,
 grizzlies.
 And


so
 Wesley
 gets
 with
 this
 professor
 who


studies
 livestock
 guardian
 dogs.


>> And
 they
 decide
 to
 try
 this
 study
 where


the
 dogs
 were
 not
 guarding
 livestock.


They
 were
 basically
 guarding
 people.


They
 were
 guarding
 the
 farms.
 And
 they


get
 these
 big
 breeds,
 these
 Turkish


breeds
 like
 Kangles
 and
 Anatolian


Shepherds,
 and
 they
 they
 recruit
 farmers


to
 participate
 in
 this
 little
 tiny


study.
 And
 these
 dogs
 were
 just


transformative
 for
 the
 farmers.
 And
 like


the
 the
 beautiful
 thing
 about
 this
 story


is
 that
 these
 dogs
 were
 protecting
 the


people
 and
 they
 were
 protecting
 the


bears
 because
 if
 the
 bears
 are
 going
 to


threaten
 people's
 lives
 and
 livelihoods,


they're
 going
 to
 get
 themselves
 killed.


So
 the
 dogs
 were
 this
 tool
 for


coexistence
 and
 the
 families
 were
 really


in
 love
 with
 the
 dogs
 and
 more
 than
 one


farmer
 said
 the
 same
 thing
 which
 was


this
 dog
 would
 lay
 down
 his
 life
 for
 me.


>> What
 was
 your
 takeaway
 from
 this
 whole


experience
 in
 Montana
 and
 the
 solutions


that
 these
 people
 had
 come
 up
 with?
 It


was
 really
 striking
 how
 this
 little


idea,
 you
 know,
 cooked
 up
 by
 this
 bear


manager
 and
 this
 professor
 ended
 up


having
 these
 real
 results
 for
 these


farmers
 and
 then
 started
 spreading
 to


other
 farms
 because
 other
 other
 farmers


in
 the
 area
 were
 seeing
 how
 well
 it
 was


working.
 Huge
 reduction
 in
 bear
 visits


>> and
 so
 all
 of a
 sudden
 they
 were
 getting


dogs.


>> So
 that
 was
 one
 thing
 and
 that
 sort
 of


speaks
 to
 the
 whole
 series,
 right,
 is


about
 how
 these
 ideas
 can
 spread.


The
 other
 thing
 specific
 to
 the
 grizzly


bears
 is
 that
 they
 were
 really


rediscovering
 this
 ancient
 knowledge,


right?
 Wesley
 went
 into
 the
 whole
 thing.


He
 saw
 less
 conflict
 between
 Native


American
 communities
 and
 grizzlies.
 And


he
 thought
 that
 maybe
 that
 had
 to
 do


with
 all
 the
 dogs
 that
 kind
 of
 roam


around
 on
 the
 reservation.


And
 of
 course,
 he
 knew
 that
 in
 Europe


and
 Asia,
 these
 large
 dogs
 hundreds
 of


years
 ago
 were
 bred
 to
 chase
 bears,


right?
 And
 so
 he
 talked
 about
 how
 with


the
 loss
 of
 these
 big
 predators
 like


grizzly
 bears
 over
 the
 last
 couple


hundred
 years,
 you
 know,
 we
 forgot
 about


these
 methods
 of
 coexistence.


And
 now
 as
 they're
 recovering,
 we're


having
 to
 relearn
 these
 ancient


practices
 that
 had
 been
 forgotten.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


The
 two
 of
 you
 set
 yourselves
 up
 to
 find


stories
 from
 all
 50
 states.
 And
 I
 do


wonder
 if
 for
 any
 reason
 some
 states


were
 more
 challenging
 than
 others.


Obviously
 certain
 states
 just


legislatively,
 if
 not
 culturally
 perhaps


are
 more
 or
 less
 focused
 on
 things
 like


climate,
 on
 things
 like
 environment,
 on


things
 like
 conservation.
 For
 example,
 I


would
 imagine
 if
 you
 went
 to
 Portland,


you
 would
 be
 quite
 easy
 to
 find
 somebody


who
 would
 come
 up
 with
 a
 creative
 vegan


solution
 to
 something.
 By
 the
 way,
 I


didn't
 even
 know
 before
 I
 read
 your


story
 that
 there
 is
 such
 a
 thing
 as
 a


vegan
 tattoo
 parlor.
 So,
 that's
 a
 tease.


Anybody
 listening
 should
 just
 go
 read


that
 story.
 But,
 I
 wonder,
 did
 you
 find


areas
 of
 the
 country
 that
 were
 just


harder
 to
 find
 folks
 who
 were
 talking


about
 any
 of
 these
 issues
 that
 we've


been
 discussing?


>> Yeah,
 Portland
 really
 boggles
 the
 mind


in
 terms
 of
 its
 vegan
 offerings.
 It's


home
 to
 a
 vegan
 strip
 club.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.
 The
 dancers
 are
 not
 allowed
 wear


leather
 or
 feathers.
 I
 don't
 know
 if
 I'm


going
 to
 say
 their
 motto.
 It
 is
 saucy.


Tell
 it.


>> The
 motto
 is
 we
 put
 the
 meat
 on
 the


pole,
 not
 on
 the
 plate.
 As
 I
 said,


creative
 vegan
 solutions.
 But
 some
 of


the
 states
 were
 definitely
 harder
 than


others.
 And
 by
 the
 time
 we
 were
 working


through
 the
 series
 towards
 the
 end,
 we


had
 covered
 so
 many
 iterations
 of
 how
 to


tackle
 climate
 and
 environmental
 crisis


that
 we
 didn't
 want
 to
 do
 repeats.
 And


so
 there
 were
 challenges
 for
 sure,
 but


one
 of
 our
 best
 stories,
 one
 of
 my


favorite
 stories
 came
 from
 North
 Dakota,


which
 it
 was
 in
 our
 second
 last
 batch
 of


stories.
 And
 my
 colleague
 Sachi
 Milky


found
 a
 beautiful
 story
 there.
 She
 found


that
 the
 Standing
 Rock
 tribe
 was
 deep
 in


an
 effort
 to
 get
 EV
 chargers
 set
 up


throughout
 tribal
 lands.
 And
 just
 remind


us
 quickly,
 Standing
 Rock.
 We
 all
 know


that
 name
 because
 because
 of
 the
 Dakota


Access
 Pipeline
 protests,
 which
 were


national
 international
 news.
 They
 were


trying
 to
 stop
 a
 pipeline
 from
 going


through
 their
 land.
 And
 they
 had
 been


trying
 for
 years
 as
 well,
 concurrent
 to


that,
 to
 get
 off
 fossil
 fuels
 in
 their


tribal
 lands
 by
 embracing
 all
 these


clean
 energy
 projects.
 And
 more


recently,
 they've
 been
 putting
 up
 EV


chargers
 so
 you
 can
 drive,
 it's
 part
 of


a
 intertribal
 network,
 so
 you
 can
 drive


electric
 vehicles
 without
 ever
 having
 to


gas
 up
 as
 you
 drive
 through
 tribal


lands.
 I
 would
 imagine
 that
 installing


electric
 vehicle
 chargers
 is
 not
 an


inexpensive
 project,
 especially
 if
 I'm


not
 mistaken,
 the
 Standing
 Rock


Reservation,
 that
 is
 in
 an
 area
 where


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 poverty,
 right?
 That


was
 one
 of
 the
 issues
 with
 the
 Dakota


Access
 Pipeline
 is
 it
 was
 cutting


through
 this
 already
 sort
 of
 vulnerable


area.
 Where
 did
 they
 get
 the
 money
 for


this
 project?
 Right.
 Well,
 one
 major


source
 it
 was
 the
 Department
 of
 Energy


grants.
 They
 won
 a
 $6
 million
 grant
 to


help
 fund
 this
 effort.
 So,
 that
 made


this
 possible.
 And
 as
 we
 spoke
 about
 at


the
 beginning
 of
 this
 conversation,


however,
 federal
 money,
 federal


initiatives
 for
 environment
 and
 climate


are
 going
 away
 or
 being
 dismantled.
 So
 I


just
 sort
 of
 wonder
 how
 does
 that
 affect


programs
 like
 this
 in
 the
 future?
 Yeah,


a
 lot
 of
 them
 are
 having
 to
 put
 things


on
 hold,
 you
 know.
 So
 in
 Fagetville,


Arkansas,
 where
 they've
 reduced
 methane


emissions
 from
 the
 landfill
 through


composting,
 they
 had
 two
 $20
 million


climate
 resilience
 projects
 they
 had
 to


shove.
 But
 on
 the
 flip
 side,
 cities
 are


looking
 at
 things
 too
 that
 are
 under


their
 purview
 where
 they
 can
 save
 a
 lot


of
 money.
 And
 that
 was
 the
 case
 in


Pittsburgh
 when
 it
 decided
 to
 tackle


light
 pollution.
 Light
 pollution,
 a
 type


of
 pollution
 that
 I
 wonder
 how
 many


people
 actually
 think
 of
 as
 real


pollution.
 People
 don't
 think
 of
 it
 as


real
 pollution,
 but
 according
 to
 a
 2023


study,
 it's
 growing
 globally
 at
 10%
 a


year.
 Many
 places
 are
 overlit.
 You
 know,


we
 know
 that
 we're
 not
 supposed
 to
 have


exposure
 to
 blue
 light
 at
 night.
 Like,


we're
 staring
 at
 our
 computer
 screens.


We
 know.


>> Yes,
 we
 know
 that,
 but
 we
 don't
 do
 it.


But


>> we
 don't
 do
 it,
 but
 we
 we
 know
 we
 know


it's
 having
 impact
 on
 our
 melatonin


levels.
 It's
 not
 just
 impacting
 us.
 It's


impacting
 pollinator
 friendly
 species


and
 birds
 and
 bats.
 It's
 also


interfering
 as
 global
 light
 grows.
 It's


interfering
 with
 processes
 in
 the


atmosphere
 that
 actually
 clean
 the
 air


>> that
 need
 nighttime
 darkness
 according


to
 a
 study
 to
 literally
 filter
 out
 the


pollution.


>> Wow.


>> Yeah.


>> We're
 also
 using
 a
 ton
 of
 energy
 doing


it.
 And
 so
 in
 Pittsburgh,
 an
 astronomy


professor
 there,
 she
 wanted
 her
 students


to
 see
 the
 dark
 skies
 at
 night.
 and
 she


had
 been
 agitating
 trying
 to
 raise


awareness
 about
 the
 benefits
 of
 dimmer,


softer
 lights.


>> So,
 what
 did
 they
 come
 up
 with?
 So,
 they


came
 up
 with
 dimmable
 street
 lights
 that


certain
 city
 officials
 can
 dim
 from


their
 phones.
 Like,
 you
 can
 just
 swipe


across
 your
 phone
 if
 you're
 a
 city


official
 and
 turn
 down
 the
 intensity
 of


street
 lights
 at
 night.
 They
 also


designed
 street
 lights
 that
 have
 hoods


over
 them.
 So
 instead
 of
 the
 light


glaring
 upwards
 where
 it
 can
 disorient


birds
 and
 other
 flying
 animals,
 they're


hooded
 and
 just
 direct
 the
 light
 down.


And
 they
 also
 save
 money.
 The
 city


projects
 that
 it'll
 save
 942,000


in
 energy
 costs
 a
 year
 and
 it'll
 prevent


12,000
 metric
 tons
 of
 carbon
 dioxide


emissions
 each
 year.
 One
 thing
 that's


really
 striking
 me
 listening
 to
 these


stories
 also
 is
 that
 we
 have
 not
 talked


about
 politics
 once.
 These
 do
 not
 seem


like
 political
 problems
 or
 politicized


solutions.
 These
 seem
 like
 people
 in


their
 communities
 trying
 to
 figure
 out


how
 do
 I
 deal
 with
 a
 problem
 that
 is


affecting
 me
 specifically.


>> And
 I
 would
 imagine
 though
 that
 the


folks
 you
 talked
 to,
 I
 mean
 again
 you


went
 to
 all
 50
 states,
 you
 probably


encountered
 folks
 who
 all
 come
 from
 very


different
 perspectives
 and
 starting


points.
 So,
 I
 just
 sort
 of
 wonder
 what


if
 anything
 there
 is
 to
 say
 about
 the


politics
 of
 reporting
 on
 this.
 I'm
 going


to
 jump
 in
 with
 an
 example.
 Oklahoma
 has


restored
 more
 streams
 than
 any
 other


state.
 And
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 they
 were


able
 to
 do
 that
 is
 they
 were
 able
 to


convince
 farmers,
 especially
 beef


farmers,
 keep
 your
 cows
 out
 of
 the


streams.
 Fence
 off
 your
 cows.
 So
 this


farmer
 that
 had
 done
 this,
 he
 found
 that


because
 his
 cows
 weren't
 drinking
 crappy


water,
 they
 were
 putting
 on
 more
 weight,


his
 vet
 bills
 were
 going
 down,
 and
 they


were
 also
 because
 they
 weren't
 slip


sliding
 up
 and
 down
 the
 bank.
 The
 whole


bank
 had
 come
 back
 to
 life
 with


wildlife.
 Bald
 eagles
 were
 nesting.
 We


didn't
 talk
 about
 politics
 once.
 He
 was


talking
 about
 doing
 things
 that
 helped


his
 bottom
 line,
 helped
 his
 cows
 be


healthier,
 and
 helped
 nature.
 In
 the


same
 token,
 it
 was
 almost
 like
 in
 a
 lot


of
 our
 reporting,
 it
 I'm
 not
 going
 to


say
 it
 transcended
 politics,


>> but
 people
 want
 clean
 air.
 They
 want


clean
 water.
 They
 want
 beauty
 around


them.
 And
 that
 was
 like
 a
 throughine
 we


found
 in
 every
 single
 state
 we
 reported


on.


>> I
 do
 sort
 of
 wonder
 like
 maybe
 there
 was


no
 question
 in
 the
 communities
 that
 you


visited
 about
 what
 the
 problem
 was,
 but


I
 can
 imagine
 that
 maybe
 there
 was


debate
 about
 what
 the
 cause
 was,


especially
 especially
 as
 it
 related
 to


climate.
 And
 I
 how
 much
 did
 that
 factor


in
 to
 your
 conversations
 or
 even
 like


how
 much
 did
 the
 cause
 of
 things
 affect


the
 solutions
 that
 people
 were
 coming
 up


with
 for
 themselves?


>> I
 do
 think
 it's
 worth
 pointing
 out
 that


sometimes
 people
 didn't
 want
 to
 talk


about
 climate
 change.
 Like
 they
 almost


felt
 sometimes
 I'd
 be
 interviewing


people
 and
 they'd
 be
 scared
 to
 even
 use


the
 term
 climate
 change.
 M


>> and
 you
 know
 farmers
 and
 ranchers
 often


are
 experiencing
 climate
 change
 but
 they


either
 don't
 want
 to
 use
 that
 word
 or


they
 definitely
 don't
 want
 to
 talk
 about


it
 as
 human
 caused.


>> Why?


>> Because
 it's
 been
 politicized.


>> Because
 they
 didn't
 want
 blowback
 in


their
 communities
 or
 because
 they
 didn't


believe
 it
 or
 like


>> a
 combo
 I
 think.


>> Okay.


>> And
 there
 were
 people
 who
 didn't
 want
 to


talk
 to
 us.
 We
 had
 one
 story
 lined
 up


that
 we
 really
 loved.
 we
 really
 wanted


to
 tell
 it
 and
 then
 they
 talked
 amongst


themselves
 and
 they
 said
 we're
 really


scared
 of,
 you
 know,
 talking
 about
 it


because
 we
 don't
 want
 the
 federal


government
 to
 come
 after
 us
 because


we're
 talking
 about
 climate
 and
 because


we
 did
 get
 some
 funding
 from
 the
 federal


government
 and
 we
 don't
 want
 to
 imperil


it.
 So,
 you
 know,
 it
 it
 was
 nuanced.
 It


was
 complicated
 often
 times
 on
 the


ground.
 I
 wonder
 if
 your
 outlook
 on
 the


future
 has
 changed
 after
 spending
 so


much
 time
 with
 people
 who
 have
 been


thinking
 about
 fixes
 at
 this
 hyper
 local


level
 like
 how
 are
 you
 looking
 at
 sort


of
 the
 broader


bigger
 holistic
 problems
 that
 the


country
 or
 the
 planet
 faces?


Yeah,
 for
 me
 the
 answer
 is
 really


two-pronged.
 The
 big
 picture
 is
 very


scary
 as
 the
 big
 picture
 often
 is.
 I


mean,
 the
 crises
 we're
 facing,
 they're


real.
 They're
 mounting.
 They're
 hitting


some
 people
 disproportionately
 compared


to
 others.
 But
 then
 on
 the
 local
 level,


as
 we
 reported
 out
 these
 stories,
 as
 I


was
 seeing
 all
 the
 different
 ways


communities
 were
 tackling
 different


aspects
 of
 climate
 change,
 I
 couldn't


help
 but
 feel
 a
 little
 bit
 hopeful.
 Like


there
 are
 so
 many
 people
 all
 over
 the


country
 that
 are
 finding
 ways
 to
 work


with
 the
 planet
 rather
 than
 against
 it.


Katherine,
 you


>> it
 is
 really
 meaningful
 to
 spend
 time


with
 people
 who
 are
 working
 so
 hard
 to


make
 their
 communities
 better
 and
 I


really
 enjoyed
 that
 personally.
 But
 like


in
 a
 broader
 way,
 it
 makes
 me
 think
 of


something
 that
 Jane
 Goodall,
 you
 know,


the
 famous
 primatologist
 and


environmentalist
 who
 died
 in
 October,


something
 that
 she
 emphasized
 a
 lot,


especially
 toward
 the
 end
 of
 her
 life,


was
 that
 like
 every
 single
 day
 that
 we


live,
 we
 are
 making
 a
 difference.
 Our


actions
 are
 making
 a
 difference,
 and
 we


get
 to
 decide
 what
 kind
 of
 difference
 we


make.


And
 the
 people
 that
 we
 interviewed
 this


year
 for
 the
 series
 just
 embodied
 that.


These
 people
 were
 really
 living
 in
 that


spirit.


[Music]


Carla
 Buckley,
 Katherine
 Einhorn,
 thank


you
 both
 so
 much
 for
 being
 here.


>> Thank
 you.
 Thank
 you.


[Music]


We'll
 be
 right
 back.


Here's
 what
 else
 you
 need
 to
 know.


Today,


Zoron
 Mandani
 was
 sworn
 in
 as
 mayor
 of


New
 York
 City
 just
 after
 midnight
 on


Thursday.
 In
 his
 inauguration
 speech,
 he


vowed
 to
 represent
 all
 New
 Yorkers,
 even


the
 ones
 who
 may
 view
 his
 administration


with
 quote
 distrust
 or
 disdain.
 If
 you


are
 a
 New
 Yorker,
 I
 am
 your
 mayor.


[Applause]


>> Regardless
 of
 whether
 we
 agree,
 I
 will


protect
 you,
 celebrate
 with
 you,
 mourn


alongside
 you,
 and
 never,
 not
 for
 a


second,
 hide
 from
 you.
 The
 speech
 was


peppered
 with
 references
 to
 the


working-class
 New
 Yorkers
 who
 helped


drive
 Mandani
 to
 city
 hall.
 The
 mayor


called
 out
 people
 who
 drive
 taxis,
 clean


public
 parks,
 and
 serve,
 as
 he
 put
 it,


biryani
 and
 beef
 patties.


>> While
 Mamani
 has
 spent
 months
 reassuring


civic
 and
 business
 leaders
 of
 his


pragmatism,
 he
 pledged
 to
 govern
 as
 a


democratic
 socialist,
 vowing
 to
 run
 the


city,
 quote,
 expansively
 and


audaciously.
 To
 those
 who
 insist
 that


the
 era
 of
 big
 government
 is
 over,
 hear


me
 when
 I
 say
 this.
 No
 longer
 will
 city


hall
 hesitate
 to
 use
 its
 power
 to


improve
 New
 Yorkers
 lives.


[Music]


And
 Tatiana
 Schlober,
 an
 environmental


journalist
 and
 a
 daughter
 of
 Caroline


Kennedy,
 died
 on
 Tuesday.


Tatiana
 received
 a
 wave
 of
 attention


recently
 for
 a
 powerful
 essay
 she


published
 in
 the
 New
 Yorker
 about
 how


she
 was
 diagnosed
 with
 leukemia
 right


after
 giving
 birth
 to
 her
 daughter.


The
 essay
 was
 about
 her
 battle
 with
 a


rare
 form
 of
 the
 illness
 and
 also
 about


her
 alarm
 at
 the
 changing
 healthcare


landscape
 for
 Americans.


But
 it
 was
 also
 very
 personal.
 It
 was


about
 dying
 and
 it
 was
 about
 parenting


and
 memory.


It
 begins
 when
 you
 are
 dying.
 At least


in
 my
 limited
 experience,
 you
 start


remembering
 everything.


Some
 of
 us
 had
 the
 pleasure
 of
 working


with
 Tatiana
 when
 she
 was
 a
 reporter
 at


the
 New
 York
 Times.
 And
 this
 week,


colleagues
 have
 been
 sharing
 their
 own


memories,
 how
 hard
 she
 worked,
 her


intelligence
 and
 poise,
 and
 also
 that


she
 was
 very
 funny.
 Tatiana
 Schllober


was
 35.
