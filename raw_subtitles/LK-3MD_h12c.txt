- All right.
So we've taken this show many places,
but this is our first time
in Dallas at The Star.
This is the brainchild
of the Jones family,
and we're talking to the man himself,
Jerry Jones. Good to see you.
- Jerry's my
North Star as an owner.
And what he is done with
this franchise, taking it
where he bought it from to
where it is today. Pretty incredible.
- No one's done it better.
Literally no one has built a more
valuable sports franchise on the planet.
$13 billion is the estimated
value of the Dallas Cowboys.
Lots of lessons that we're
gonna learn from Jerry Jones.
I can't wait. Let's do it.
Jerry Jones, thank you so much
for having us here in Texas.
- Well, first of all,
I'm proud you are here.
We're overlooking the field,
and I'm kind of proud of
what's around the field as well
with our Star.
So thanks for coming to the Star.
Great to be with both of you. And Alex,
I'm so proud to see my neighbor,
my old neighbor back here in Dallas.
- That's right.
- So Alex, I'm
gonna let you kick it off.
- Yeah. So, you know,
Jason, when I first decided
that I wanted to own a team,
this is something I've been
dreaming about for forever
and ever since I was a teenager,
but of course I come from
very humble beginnings.
But I said, there's one
owner I must talk to,
and that's Mr. Jerry Jones.
And I made a call to Charlotte.
This was around COVID time.
We were taking a run at, at the Mets
- Jerry's daughter, Charlotte Jones. Yeah,
- Charlotte Jones.
I said, boy, but tell you,
maybe in a couple weeks
she'll get Mr. Jones on.
'cause he is very busy. And
Charlotte hits me up right back.
Hey, Jerry would love to talk to you.
How's Wednesday at two
o'clock? I said, done.
And I thought it was gonna be 15 minutes.
And boy, I tell you what, ninety
minutes later I have like pages
and pages of notes, and he gave me,
you gave me the most incredible
advice that I'll never forget.
And for that, I'm very grateful.
So that, that call
really meant a lot to me.
And a lot of what you told me along with
what I learned from George Steinbrenner
and others that I respect
and admire, I think about
that as an owner today
of the Minnesota Timberwolves
and the Minnesota Lynx.
So thank you for that.
- Well, congratulations.
And you know, the minute
that you told me you were
gonna get involved at the
ownership level, it just made
all the sense in the world.
The fact that you had always wanted
to be in ownership says it all as well.
Because in my mind, there is
a connection. It's a passion.
It, you can call it competitiveness,
but it's accomplishing
things that are hard to do.
But, you know, you mentioned
George Steinbrenner
and my early days with the
Cowboys, I'd get a nice note
and I always look forward to
it, and it would be from him.
And he would give me, I
call 'em my sweet nothings.
I put 'em in a file that I had that for.
But it were daily encouragements.
And because there was a lot of criticism
because of, of the way
that we bought the Cowboys,
changed the coaches out, and
frankly did a lot of changes.
Well, of all the people in the world
to be getting those nice encouraging notes
that boy stick in there. Keep it going.
I've got a legacy there.
And we, George Steinbrenner, the family
and my family set up a
company called Legends.
- Yeah.
- And that was of
course, many years later.
And I got to meet with him several times
as we were talking about legends
And Legends serves many, many sports,
and it serves facilities
and the process of really fan engagement.
I'll never forget though.
George Steinbrenner
told the group when we met,
he said, I don't need
anything written down.
You, you don't spend any money
or time on that contract over there.
He and I will shake hands
and we'll have all we need
to make this business work.
- So Jerry, you know, you,
you mentioned you getting
into ownership and,
and a lot that led to that.
You know, when Alex calls you
and says he's going to,
you know, buy into the NBA
and the WNBA, no one would
doubt that that was a good deal
when you bought the Dallas Cowboys,
People thought you were insane.
People thought it was a bad business
and that you are overpaying.
What gave you the certitude
that this was a good deal?
- Well, it, it truly was passion.
And just as passion
can help you in many aspects of life,
I really didn't see
those obvious obstacles.
I just didn't see them.
Now you say, well, can't
you see losing a million
dollars a month?
Are you blind? What, what?
How much were you drinking
when you bought the,
when you bought the Cowboys?
Well, the point is, I looked
for ways, and this is common.
I looked for ways that were
maybe a little ambitious,
but I looked for ways to solve
every one of those problems.
And while there may have been long odds,
there may have been a little
imagination in those ways.
I took those problems
and I thought I had a solution
as to how to address them.
That's what you will do when
you wanna do it real bad.
And yes, the Cowboys, it was daunting.
But the point is that it was always there.
The interest in becoming involved
and becoming involved in
a way that, let's say,
unlike A-Rod becoming in a
way that didn't swing the bat
or didn't make the block,
which I certainly appreciated
as a great fan,
but becoming involved in a
way that would make it better.
I found no sports franchise
anywhere in the world
that was making any money.
You see, sports had been
a great, great portrayer
of what sports is about.
It's called publicity.
Well the difference in
publicity in my point
of view than marketing, is
that publicity has great audiences.
It has great, if you will, interest
and can create interest.
Marketing is when you take that publicity
and you bring it home
and set up a plan to monetize
some of it and go out
and get that and have enough
coming back in to go again.
That's called a business model.
- Yeah.
- Well, sports had
not only the great passion
and the natural instincts
of competing in everybody
and the appreciation of people that do,
but sports had this
massive, massive publicity
and massive understanding.
But yet it had no business
model to make it call marketing
where you could bring back
a little and go again.
- Right.
- That was totally necessary for me
because I couldn't go again.
Now what happened with me was,
candidly, is that the amount
of money I had wasn't what was needed.
But because the NFL
and the Cowboys were, were really slow,
we were really down and
out financially, frankly,
because of that, then the
NFL knew they had a problem.
The bankers didn't worry about me
because they didn't loan
anything on the Cowboys.
The bankers loaned it on
a receivable that I had.
And so the approval of me
getting through the door
and still not having any money left
to go buy the general partners
that I had agreed under
contract to go buy out,
but I didn't have the money to go do that.
- So Jerry, along those
lines, so go back to 1989,
you're losing a million
dollars per month now.
I heard you also say
that you may have wanted
to buy a business that was cash flowing
to offset some of those losses.
As you think about filling
those holes, was that stressful?
And what was your strategy?
Walk us through that
- On a personal basis.
I had such pride
and such an experience in
sport when I was in college
and my senior year at Arkansas,
we won the national championship.
While I had been schooled in
selling insurance, I could gnaw
that leg off the chair selling.
But what I hadn't done was been really
schooled in financial.
And so I thought because
I could tell a good story
and could borrow all that money, that
that was the way to go.
And so my first year
or two outta college,
I borrowed more money
than you could even count.
And my first year outta school,
I think my commissions were $30,000.
My interest was $150,000.
To give you an idea how
over my skis I had gotten,
it took me years.
It took my Gene, my wife,
getting her purse taken out
of her hands and cards,
credit cards cut in two,
it took the bill players coming.
So I had really gotten a lesson in how not
to do it as far as buying something.
Well, I managed to come through that
and it was the greatest
education that I'd ever had.
Well, then I was very fortunate
and got some real finances
with the oil and gas business
after all that butt kicking that I got
for getting out over my skis.
After all of that, to show you
how passionate or crazy I was
after going through that of thinking
that the old financial death
had been at ray, I turned
around and bought the Dallas Cowboys.
That shows you how much
passion was involved.
But I remember when we talked
Alex, I said, listen, I said,
nothing, nothing can stand
in the way of passion.
- So I think Alex would
probably validate this,
that when he goes to buy
a team, part of the advice
that he gets is sit,
don't make any big moves,
no sudden moves.
Don't get rid of a bunch
of people Right away,
you didn't follow that advice.
Basically, the minute
you come in, you get rid
of this legendary coach.
You fired everybody from the
guy in the announcing the
public announcements to
the head of publicity
and the general manager.
Why, what did you see that
was so wrong with them
that you felt like you
immediately had to act?
- You have to assume
when you buy something
that who you buy it from
knows what it's worth, like it is.
Give them credit
or certainly their creditors might know.
They know what the business is.
So a big mistake is not to
automatically build in, know
that you've gotta change the scenery.
If you pay what you're going to pay,
assume they're getting top dollar
and have taken it when
they got your money.
So you have to really go
in thinking change.
When it was as dramatically
outta kelter as the Cowboys were,
I had to have radical change
and I had to do it yesterday.
So there was an urgency.
You didn't have time to have a
good time, so to speak.
That plus, again, the fact that
I can't emphasize enough,
I felt like Herschel Walker
running through the line,
it was just bouncing off of me.
There were all kinds of
hurdles that were popping.
And of course, where was the bad day?
Well, I couldn't have a bad day
because I was getting to do
something that I'd wanted
to do all my life.
And that ruled the day.
- So one of the other
most seminal deals that
that you make is, you
mentioned Herschel Walker
got rid of him, you traded him.
- Yeah.
- It turns out to be arguably one
of the most brilliant trades
in, in the history of football.
Did not seem that way at the time.
Talk us through that decision.
- If you look at making change,
and certainly Herschel
Walker was a change,
He was the best player we had,
and it was well known. In this
particular case, you were kind
of new on the block,
so you automatically
didn't know what you were doing.
Always. When it's an
accomplished name of,
whether it's sport or otherwise,
always, when you get a divorce
there, it's gonna look bad
for the one that made the decision.
Always. There's no question,
if you can't handle that,
then don't make the trade.
Or if you can't anticipate
that, don't make the trade.
That's alive and well.
But what it caused you to
do is not just the tangible
consideration you got, which
at that time were draft picks.
You didn't have a cap at that time.
But you had those draft picks
and that was the tangible,
what those trades did.
What those picks did was
allow us to use them, not only
for using them in the draft,
but we used them to trade.
Trade. And we did it with,
I'm not gonna say randomness,
but we did it with reckless
abandon, if you want to.
It caused you to be more of a player
because it was like going to Las Vegas
with money in your pocket.
And I don't think there's
any question that I'm willing
to take risk in those early days
after having acquired the
Cowboys that we built,
players built our roster.
I think the, the ability to
cut and shoot was a big deal.
- I've heard you talk about ambiguity.
I think about it from the
lens of sports.
Jerry, There's some guys that I've
played with that are free agents
and they don't know when
that next check's coming from
or where it's coming from.
And you create a 300 hitter
becomes a 215 hitter.
A guy that hits thirty home runs,
hits eighteen home runs
because of the nerves.
The same is true in business,
but you have this ability
to not knowing what's gonna happen next
to perform at a high level.
Do you believe that's true?
And and where does that
come from if it is true?
- Well, I know it's true in my situation,
but I think it's very true.
And some of the greatest people
that have ever been
involved in the professions
or business, they don't function
as well if they don't know
what's gonna happen at the end
of the week, especially
financially, they need to know that
so that they can get on with
the, their business of being
as excellent as they are.
On the other hand, there are some people
that the ambiguity that's
out there of not knowing
what your check is, they're
better than if they knew
what the check was gonna be.
They're more clever, they're
more cunning, they're more,
they've just got more skill
and are willing to exert it.
I call that tolerance for ambiguity.
Tolerance for ambiguity.
And the classic,
at least known story was the
famous riverboat gambler,
charming mustache sitting there.
The next card up is gonna
get him thrown off the boat,
or he is gonna own the boat.
Now that's when he's the best
that he is in his life.
And of course he's gotten
thrown off that boat before
and he's won the boat a few times.
The difference is though,
I'll bet you not a one
of those charming son of a
guns didn't know how to swim.
- Now you can play that hand,
but you better know how to swim
because you're gonna get thrown
off the boat a little bit.
- You've gotten thrown
off the boat
- A little bit.
- I have too
- I was gonna say you too
- Me too.
- You guys have been thrown
off some boats together.
So I, I do want to, you know,
move ahead a little bit chronologically
because one of the ways
that you step out is
with your deal making.
You know, you're, you come
in, you're part of this club,
a club that a lot of people especially
now want to be a part of.
And NFL has its way of doing business
and you at some point decide
that you might be able
to do this a little bit better.
And I'm thinking
specifically the Nike deal.
- You know, this is
a Nike athlete right here.
Everybody remembers you
and Phil Knight walking out on that field.
How does that deal come about?
How do you decide to do
that knowing that the NFL,
they've got Reebok, they're good,
you decide you can do something better.
- I had known a great
coach named Eddie Sutton,
and he had told me about
Phil Knight as a young man,
bringing his things to where
he was coaching in college
and selling it out of the
trunk that Phil Knight had
had that path to where he was.
But the thing that was obvious to me was
that he took a shoe
or he took performance
or perspective performance
mentally in a shoe.
And he did such a good job
of telling the story with it
that he made me think if
I could put the shoe on,
I could run faster.
- Right. Right.
- And that so hit home with me relative to
what sports is about, but
really can be accentuated.
It truly is the story when you see
a rare player, a rare athlete, there's
so much more that's going on there with
that rare athlete.
And just the story of what's
making him rare, comparing him
to the other players
or other competition, I
call it one in one is three.
And I apply that to everything.
Whether it's a business decision,
one in one is three in
sports, not two, but three.
And it's because that
three is imagination.
That three is putting
yourself in in a way,
having yourself hit the home run
or having yourself there
when you're watching
or thinking about it.
That area right there is an intangible
because it is an intangible.
That's where the biggest
margins are in business.
Not down here where everybody's doing it
and the engineers are working on it.
They've got it whittled
down to right there.
This area right here that
imagineering, that imagination part.
That makes one in one three.
Is where the margins are
and frankly, where the glory is.
- I spent my 25 year career with Nike
and Phil Knight was just
the most amazing partner.
And it delighted me
when you made that move.
But my question is, when you
come up with that idea at home,
you're thinking in the couch
or wherever from the time
you call Phil Knight,
how long did it take and how
do those conversations go?
Are you pitching your idea of
why this is a great marriage?
How does that go? If you
can give us a little color?
- I visited with him, my wife Gene
and son Jerry went to their headquarters.
I'll never forget, I was
visiting with a couple
of his folks about what
this might look like.
And he came in and we had
gotten pretty far along
and he looked over at
me, I'll never forget it.
And he said, I have never
paid so much for nothing
in my life.
But he said, he said, this
thing is something about it.
I like, when we initially made our deal,
he couldn't use Cowboys or
he couldn't use the star.
- Wow.
- We just did the deal
with the stadium.
Now, as Charlotte said,
she Niked the stadium.
We made that stadium look
like it was Nike headquarters
out there, but we didn't
do it with the team.
We basically brought the
team out in no colors
and no sponsor at all.
But when we got to New York,
we were playing the Giants.
And that's when we made this announcement.
And at that time, when we
walked out on the field,
I had a suit on, but I had
the Nike tennis shoes on
and Phil walked out with me
and I had the Nike hat on.
And we had met earlier with Al Michaels,
and we had met with Dan Dierdorf
and we had met in the dressing room.
And I explained to them
what this was about
and where the edge was regarding the NFL
and where it was regarding Nike
and the Cowboys that made
it a contentious thing.
I'll never forget Al
Michael said, now we may have,
if we have a close game
here, we might not get much
to this in the second half.
Well, we had quite a lead
the Cowboys did going into half time,
so they spent that entire
half talking about this
relationship and the NFL
and what might might occur.
That next morning Phil called me
and he said, I have never
had such a bang for my buck
in you're life when he called.
And I'll tell you from that time on,
I could walk down the streets in New York,
I could be in Chicago, and
you'd have drivers in cars
and what have you, just point
to Nike and say, go get 'em.
So the controversy, the controversy,
if you will,
- Interesting.
- The controversy created also a huge
of interest when
otherwise it might just
been some commercial issue,
but created a huge interest.
And of course the potential result
relative to my relationship with the NFL
and that type thing, that got a little
touchy there for a little while.
But in general, I can't
say enough about Phil
and his buying into the idea
of taking a team.
Now he obviously to this
day, wants to be a part
of Nike and the NFL and
it's as it should be.
But when it's the thing
to do, you can do both.
Team, League.
- That's right.
- Take everything you say.
And, and I believe it.
And yet Paul Tagliabue,
the commissioner at the time was like,
what's Jones doing down there?
We, we've got this deal.
What, what makes him think that he can,
he can go and do this?
Did you have that in your mind?
- Well, I had, and have all
the respect in the world
for Paul Tagliabue,
but I was operating on different gasoline.
I had the ultimate, they
had to come through me.
It was my fanny that was gonna
get put out on the street
if the Cowboys didn't make
more sense financially.
And if something happened
to the Cowboys, frankly
it had a good chance of happening
to others in the NFL
other teams in the NFL.
And so I didn't see a
solution to get in line,
get in sync, get right in with
the other, at that time,
29 teams, 30 teams.
I didn't see that answer either
because I hadn't found
that answer to do that.
And so candidly, it wasn't comfortable.
I'm not gonna say it's comfortable,
but it was inspirational to think
that I was doing something
about the problem. And the way
that I was doing something about it.
Maybe for everybody, maybe not. First,
I was interested in what
it did for the Cowboys.
And I knew good and well, some
of the things I was suggesting
that I was getting criticized
for were in the best
interest of the Cowboys.
And I really thought they were in the best
interest of the NFL.
I think the clubs
and the great markets they're
in around this country,
they have all of the ability in the world
to promote their brands
and to be imaginative in terms of,
of involving fans in products or services.
And I think they have the ability
to get involved more than
you do at one central place.
But on the other hand, I thought the NFL
as a whole had a fabulous
inventory of things
to engage companies and services.
And they do very much,
it's called Super Bowl.
It's called the game itself.
And so picture, if you will,
a circle that's got all
of the clubs in it and
then you have the NFL.
Well, I could see each club
in their areas of marketing
and making their deal with Nike.
And then I could see the NFL
having a deal if Nike Yes.
But maybe with an a
competing, competing entity
that fundamentally was
what it was all about.
- Right. Because I mean,
essentially what happens, you know,
for those who aren't as familiar
with it, is they sue you.
You counter sue. I mean it contentious.
It, it goes, it, it gets real contentious.
It gets litigious. Did
you know that that was
how this was ultimately gonna get settled?
You knew there would be a fight?
- Well, first of all, frankly,
and I had no other way to think about it,
the amount the league sued me
for immediately they owned
the Cowboys
- 300 million, right.
- $300 million at the time.
And I told you that I'd spent it all
and didn't have, the ultimate
figure was to buy the Cowboys.
And so it was dramatic for
me and traumatic for me,
but caused me to certainly
grow, if you will, buck up,
sleep less, but sharpen up.
And it was an experience
that I think we used
as a platform again for in
years, as years have gone
by and really have benefited
from that more ways than just
a shot of juice for the sponsorship area.
I didn't know that buying
the Cowboys by the way.
- I didn't see that at all.
I did see and say, look, I'm
gonna have to find something,
or I'm gonna have a loss
leader of millions of dollars
for the rest of my life.
So I'm gonna need to go get something
to associate the Cowboys with
that can help me tow
the bill tow the freight
for owning the Cowboys.
- Jerry, we were sitting at
a game at a Cowboy game maybe
three, four years ago.
And you said to me, Alex,
I'm around seventy nine, maybe eighty,
and I work harder today than I when
I was thirty nine or forty nine.
Where do you get that work ethic from?
'Cause it's remarkable you
haven't slowed down one bit.
- Well, first of all,
we were talking earlier
and when you bought the
team,
- Yeah
- You were fifty.
If you could possibly from fifty
to my age today, if you
could have 10% of the fun
that I've had over the last thirty years,
- I'll take five
- Ten...
- Okay, take five of it.
I promise you there's no way
to measure what life has been
since touching sport and
touching the Dallas Cowboys.
But it's given me such
an inspirational base
that it's caused me to do things and,
and really things
that aren't necessarily
directly associated at
all with the Cowboys.
And the moral of the story,
the lesson is if you've got a dream
or if you've got something
that you're passionate about,
boy give your passion a whole lot of value
in terms of putting your
assets together to go do it.
- And so Jerry, to that point,
you know, for those of us
who, who've watched you
more closely over the past,
call it ten, fifteen, twenty
years, certainly the last five
or ten, we see someone who is
very comfortable with risk,
very comfortable with controversy.
What becomes clear in watching
your whole history is this is
a feature, not a bug.
This, this is, this is who you are.
What gives you such comfort with risk
because you seek it out, you,
you run toward it, it feels like.
- Yeah. Well I, I think
that the experience,
if you've taken risks, then
certainly you have failed.
I think as much as anything,
it's the ability to deal
with the failure and
ask the question, okay,
when you get up a month from now
and it's gone totally the
other way for you, look
around at your
relationships, look around at
what you're about in life
now, can you live with how
that's going to feel when it didn't work?
It's that test, it's that next
day test, that next week test,
Can you go? If you can do that,
then you go back over there
and say, okay, now what do I have to do?
And financially what
the work you have to do
to put it together.
The one thing I've always been able
to do is borrow more
money than I should have.
And I'm real good at it.
And it crippled me when
I was much younger just
getting outta college.
So I've really never seen
something that I didn't think
that I could figure out a way
to financially make it, make it happen.
Ever.
Now what I also though have in
these cobwebs back there,
and if you're ever cut me open, that's
what you've got in there is all
of those times when I couldn't pay.
When I first got involved
with the Cowboys,
it was pretty frankly very
negative in this area.
And I had a reporter come up
and we won one football
game our first year
and the reporter asked me, he said,
these have gotta be the
lowest days of your life.
- I said, about 15 years
before I bought the Cowboys,
I came in Love Field at
that time, the airport here in Dallas.
And I went up to a little
stand, it was a Rent a car
stand, small by today's
standards, put my card out there
and said I need to rent a
car for my work down here.
They looked down a list, took
my card right in front of me
and just cut it in two, they
said, young man, you need
to know how to learn
how to pay your bills.
You don't have any credit.
That's a hard day in Dallas, Texas.
Not just winning one
football game all year long.
Those are the hard days right there.
And so again, not to
overemphasize the point,
the thing we're talking about,
the interest in extending
the interest in sport
and certainly the years I've
been involved when it didn't
quite work financially,
now we're doing some good lately about how
to make it work financially.
And that we're seeing
that is more there than we
might have thought were there.
I didn't necessarily see
that. I really didn't.
I found it out pretty quick
that it was, it was there.
So looking back seems like,
well, you know, that ought
to have work that should have,
if you're sitting out
here now, social media
and all of the eyeballs
there, you ought to be able
to figure out a way to
attach that affinity
to a product or a service.
You should be able to do that.
Well we hadn't done that
and to me that's there today
and it's there more so
than it's ever been.
- Well, and one of the things that,
to your exact point Jerry, a
around the, the value of sports
and the value of teams that
has become very apparent.
Private equity coming into sports
and specifically the National
Football League has been a,
a seminal moment for the league.
What do you make of private
equity so far in the league?
- I think that, first of all,
let me clear this up.
I'm a Main street guy,
not a Wall Street guy.
I was raised with a family.
That was the, the, the
heart of the customer.
The customer is right
that approach to things.
The thing that is so important is
to take your critical associations.
And that can be products,
service, companies.
It can possibly be those very investors.
I'm gonna call them minority investors.
Although I don't accept
a minority investor,
I don't want to say
that about an investor.
Anybody that wants to
put hundreds of thousands
or a million dollars in the
team, boy I want 'em to be just
as entitled frankly as I feel
about it to get that done.
And I want to treat 'em that way.
And I want 'em to think that
when they walk out here,
if they come out here, I want
'em to think they're a part
of this team because they
are, they're critical.
Name me any business
that when they have great capital sources,
don't really have a lot of energy
and a lot of success.
And so sports today is
getting real capital
sources as other investments would.
And that capital resources, a part of that
is not some dividend check,
are not some plaque on the wall.
A part of that is being involved
and getting to be a part of the team.
I think that's critical.
I've had people involved
in our team, the Cowboys,
not a direct ownership,
but as a valued sponsor
And let's say a beer sponsor,
well that's Jerry Jones
out at the floor of that
warehouse at six in the morning.
- And you'd think, I was talking to the
football team at halftime.
Instead I'm talking
to the drivers and I'm
talking to the drivers about
how when they go in at 7-Eleven, talk
to the manager about product placement
and putting it to where more
people will buy the beer.
I'm explaining that to them.
So consequently, I'm
as interested in the Cowboys
helping them be what they want
to be as they are and being
interested in the Cowboys.
So that's not exactly the relationship
that somebody might think
if they were sitting there
as an investment in a fund
or something like that.
There's more to being an owner in sports.
And it can be, and it
can be very rewarding.
- You told me that in that phone call
and you said, Alex, it has to be you.
You gotta be the chief marketing officer,
the chief revenue officer.
It's gotta be you, not anyone you hire.
They wanna see you and
you're gonna open doors for
that team and it's gotta be you.
You said it like three times.
You said, don't forget that.
- So Jerry, would you, you
know, you have held onto this
as your family business for all I, I have
to think you've got people
knocking on your door, especially
with these newly approved
private equity firms.
They'd love to buy a stake in the Cowboys.
Would you consider that?
- Well, I know that I asked one person,
his name was Don Tyson of Tyson's Chicken.
He's a great friend of mine.
He sat with me at two Super Bowls.
But when I bought the Cowboys
and I lived in Arkansas,
I asked Don if he'd like
to join me in buying the Cowboys.
And Don said I'm gonna buy Holly
Farms here in a few months.
And so, and I'm not quite into
the sport thing like you are.
So he said, I'm not gonna to do it.
But he said, Jerry, is it possible for you
to do it by yourself?
And I said, well, yeah,
but I'm talking to you
because it'd be a lot more comfortable
and a lot easier to have
with you as a partner.
He said, if you can do this
without a partner, okay,
you should do it because
partners are expensive.
That would be from the eyes
of let's say the majority owner.
Well of course they're
expensive, they're your partners.
They own the team like you own it.
And they should be
involved and be included
and be made to not, not some kind
of fictitious thing, but
be made to be involved.
And candidly, I feel
that way about our key
sponsors as well.
To me that's wearing it.
Now you and I both know
all owners don't get involved
like George Steinbrenner did.
All of 'em don't get
involved like I get involved.
But candidly, if you want this thing to be
what it can be for you, A-Rod,
that is the way to engage.
And what you've ended
up with is a almost a a,
a family of your own
involved with the Cowboys.
In my particular case, I've gotten
to spend this journey
directly with my family and
as it's turned out,
they have become not the ones
we started the journey with.
And they have, we have evolved,
we've all evolved together.
And I get credit for, most
of the credit I get are their
ideas and their execution.
But my whole point is it is the journey
and it is the being involved.
And the good news is, is
that we can step up there
and win a championship,
Have all of this, all of this reminds me
of the Godfather now I'm
gonna provide the protection,
the money, and everything else.
Tell me why I deserve this.
- Good deal.
- And so when you talk
about your family, Jerry,
what I hear you saying,
and I want you to keep us honest here, is
that this will be the family business.
You're not looking for
partners at this point.
Is that a fair statement?
- Yeah, and I think the
best way to make my point is
that I alluded to it earlier.
I didn't make an investment.
I did not make an investment.
I invested in a job
and that's why from the very get go,
I said I was gonna be involved
in every way. My children
buying through me back in those years
were not a part of an investment.
We bought the team, but
what we got were jobs
and we got a career and guess what?
We got a life. And I can't tell you what
the most rewarding thing of
course has been really working
with them and having
them involved as well.
So under those circumstances,
because, they've
spent a lifetime working
with the Cowboys, I
don't see that changing.
And of course there's
no succession plan here
because they've been doing it anyway.
- And so what I would imagine, just
to put a fine point on it,
people must knock on your door wanting
to invest in the Cowboys.
And you just say, no thank you.
- Well, I've had wonderful
opportunities, frankly yes.
To have partners almost,
almost from the time I bought the club.
As a matter of fact, the
next morning I got up
after we had had a, our announcement
that we were gonna buy the
team and make the changes.
I get a call from Bum Bright
who had sold me the team
and he said, I just got a
call from probably the most
qualified people you could ever imagine.
And said they were there,
they've seen where I was,
had a handshake or whatever we got.
And they said to tell you that you can,
whatever's on the piece of paper
we sign, which wasn't much,
they'll take it, give
you $10 million to go home
to Arkansas that morning.
I said, Mr. Bright, I said,
tell 'em that's thanks
for their offer, but no,
I'm on this thing now.
And we we're going with it.
But the bottom line is that
the time spent, the commitment,
the being involved, it, it
really hadn't been work.
- Right.
- Been some worry
now, been some serious, serious what ifs.
Principally early financial,
very early financial,
I could really have envisioned disaster.
- And frankly I had gotten to a point to
where I shouldn't have risked
that regarding my family,
especially after what I'd
been through and knew better.
But I did it because I
wanted to be involved.
But I was very aware,
it's like being operated
on a little bit while
you're still awake.
I was very aware the whole time of how
an embarrassing thing it would
be to have to leave Dallas
and leave the Cowboys here
or the whatever's left of it.
- Right. And so your
succession plan is essentially,
you said there's no succession plan,
but the succession plan is your kids.
- Yes. And it's in place.
And the truth is, they could operate
today if we decided we
wanted to go someplace.
- So Jerry, I have two daughters
and their North star is Jeannie Buss.
Great. The great Dr. Buss's
daughter and Charlotte.
And you know, they want to be
involved with sports one day.
So they, they watch, they admire,
just like I have studied
you over the years,
they're studying
Charlotte and Jeannie Buss.
- Yeah.
- So I hope to have that one day.
- I can't tell you how
much I think that women are
such a part of, of the future of sport.
We know it in the NFL, we're
so proud of our percentage
of women that are involved in sport.
- We're gonna get to our, our
lightning round in a second.
But, but there's one thing
that just sort of strikes me,
you know, sitting here with, with both of
who are larger than life characters,
if I can say this at about my partner and
and characters who have
had to deal with a lot
of stuff coming at you over the course
of your careers from
when you were a player
to now from all, all
through your ownership.
What's your advice for
blocking out the noise?
You get a lot of criticism
every day in the paper,
every day on social media.
Stephen A. Smith, whoever
it is fussing at you
or fuss, fussing about
you, what's your secret?
- Well first of all,
sports gives you such a,
a space entering at, you know,
that you're gonna have criticism.
You strike out and you
strike out at critical times sometimes.
And the very thing
that we encourage is
fans' interest in that.
And fans sitting there with opinions
and their opinions about whether
or not we did it the way
they would've done it
or what their expectation was.
That's what it's based
on. And it's so authentic.
And so you live in that.
And certainly I, I don't
guess I should be proud of it,
but I don't, I don't know of many
that have had more criticism
than I've had over the last
thirty five, forty years to be involved.
But I've never ever
resented that in any way.
As a matter of fact, I, I wanna address it
and wanna be a part of it.
Sometimes I think that there
may be something wrong here.
I seem to do better when
they're criticizing me
than than when I'm not.
But sports allows you to do
that now it really does
allow you to show 'em
and it allows you to have a
certain place within yourself.
You're part of a team always,
but within yourself it
allows you to imagine
coming back and showing them.
We just made a trade on Michah
Parsons.
- Really? I missed that.
No I'm just kidding.
But we just made a trade
with Michah Parsons.
Well of course I want to show
that we can be successful
with the result of what that brings
to the Dallas Cowboys that's going to bat.
Can you imagine, I'm still
sitting here going to bat,
I remember last year after,
or we had a, a loss that really
had me down. And so I know
that you're supposed to make that list.
It's the old Ben Franklin list
where on the left side
you list all of the things
that you've got that are great
and on the right side you
list all of the negatives
that are going on, which
would certainly be the order
of the day in that circumstances.
Well I want you to know
that sometimes I have
to list my things that I do right.
I have to list it about
five times in five different
ways to make my list longer.
But I always come out of
there with a positive list
glad to be playing
ball today.
- That's right. That's right.
- Alright, we're gonna do our rapid fire.
So it's ten questions, we'll
bounce it back and forth.
And first thing that comes
to your mind, what's one word
to describe your deal making style?
- Optimistic.
- What's more important to you?
- Your gut or data?
- Gut.
- Who's your dream
deal making partner?
- Oh I would. I would put
George Steinbrenner right there.
Not 'cause it's convenient.
- What's your the best piece
of advice you received on deal
making or running a business?
- It's not right
or wrong, it's handle
and cut your wrongs short and
let your rights run long.
- What's the worst
advice you've been given?
- I'd say it's from bankers.
Either on one side,
anxious to loan the money
or on another side
being a little reluctant
to buy into my idea.
- What's a deal you wish you had done?
- You know, I thought
the Minnesota Vikings,
when Red McCombs bought 'em, I thought
that was the equivalent of not far back,
but that was like buying a
$50,000 house on a $500,000
block full of houses.
I thought if there's
any way to involve that
with a family or a friend.
And of course they've ended
up with some great ownership.
But that was for me at that time,
the best deal I'd seen on the street, so
to speak, in sport.
- What's more stressful the
fourth quarter of a playoff game
or the final round of a negotiation?
- Oh, I think that playoff
game is what it's all about.
I know a lot of people say
Jerry's interested in the
interested in the values
and he is interested in the financial.
It was always about getting
a chance to come in here
and do those things that let
you get to maybe have a chance
for a world championship.
And that's primary.
- What's your hype song before
you go into a big meeting
or a big negotiation?
- I wanna be sweet here. Hard times.
- There you go. There you go.
You can only watch one sport other than
football for the rest of
your life. What is it?
- Oh, baseball is my favorite.
- There you go.
- And that's not because he's
sitting there at all.
Yeah, just cause they have it.
- Alright, so we usually
ask what's one team you want
to win a Super Bowl or championship?
So I'm gonna avoid that.
My question is, what's the
first thing you're gonna do when
you win your next championship?
And I'm gonna add this,
and can I come along?
- I'm gonna make a victory tour
and this day and time with social media
and everything, it'll
be quite a victory tour.
And let me say this, every
time I make a decision
with the Cowboys, a
little image pops up about
what you're going to do when
you're holding a trophy.
- That's right. And you will.
- We look forward to seeing
you holding that someday soon.
