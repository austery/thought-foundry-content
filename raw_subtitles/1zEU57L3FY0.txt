>> What do you think of when I
say the words industrial policy?
Kind of sounds like jargon,
right?
But it's actually way more
than that.
Industrial policy is basically
a guide designed by government
to help shape the economy
so it works better.
It's about encouraging
innovation, boosting
productivity, and helping
the country or province grow.
It used to relate mostly to
manufacturing, but people talk
about it now in terms of all
kinds of sectors.
We know the province is
focusing on automotive, EVs,
AI and more.
But could an industrial policy
help us become more globally
competitive and could
innovation drive it?
I asked David Wolfe,
professor emeritus
of political science at the
University of Toronto and
co-director of the Innovation
Policy Lab at the Munk School
of Public Policy and Stephany
Lapierre, founder of and chief
brand officer at Tealbook, a
supply chain software start-up.
David.
Stephanie, welcome to
The Rundown.
How are you guys doing?
>> Extremely well.
Yeah.
Good.
Thanks for having us.
>> All right, David, now that
we understand what industrial
policy is, why is industrial
policy important?
>> We're living in a different
era than we did in the 20th
century.
Even the beginning of
the 21st.
And more and more countries
are moving up the scale
in terms of the complexity
of the products they produce,
the export markets they're
penetrating into.
And many of these countries have
used industrial policy to get
to where they are today.
If we want to keep up
or stay ahead, we need to use
the same policy tools.
>> Can you grade Canada in
terms of its industrial policy?
When we take a bigger picture.
>> Canada doesn't have an
industrial policy, neither does
Ontario, so it would be very
hard to grade them.
Ontario Ontario created
an industrial policy framework
in 1992 that I was involved
with to the best.
It lasted 3 or 4 years and the
next government got rid of it,
and that's the last time we've
tried to do anything on that
kind of scale.
>> All right.
We'll get back to that.
Stephanie, you are the
founder and chief brand officer
of Tealbook.
What does your company do?
>> So I'm trying to simplify
this.
>> For the non-tech people.
>> Yeah, yeah.
So we're a data company.
So we focus on data.
And we were one of the first
companies in Toronto to use AI
to collect data on businesses.
So what it means is if a
company, an enterprise has buy
goods and services, they're
buying from companies, and
there's a lot of information to
collect from those companies to
manage finance and supply chain
and procurement and risk.
But right now, they're usually
asking those providers to put
information into portals.
And so our technology collects
all the information.
We've created a very high
quality and credible
foundation of 230 million
verifiable businesses.
And we're connected to
countries registries.
So it's like if you're a
business and you register
with a government and get
a tax ID number, we connect it
to that.
And that allows our customers
to have a really good picture
and all the information
they need to do business
with suppliers to manage risk
or optimise what they're
spending money on, or decide
if they're going to buy
more locally or, you know,
trying to bring new suppliers
from, you know, external.
>> So procurement is the big
sort of.
>> So we've been focussed on
procurement but data touches
finance.
It touches like if you're in
risk and compliance
in a company, you need to
understand your supplier base
so that you can monitor risk
much better.
You can also ensure that
you're reviewing those
suppliers on a consistent
basis.
So data is really important.
And finance you're
paying suppliers.
So it's really important
you're paying the right
suppliers and you're
not paying them twice.
And supply chain you need to
understand the risk and the
potential disruption to your
business.
So there's a lot of reasons
why everyone in the company
that touches third
party providers would need data.
>> I imagine I'm hearing money
here because I'm thinking for a
lot of these companies,
efficiency is important when
you're thinking of the company
itself.
But the manufacturers
tell me a little bit about sort
of the importance of being an
efficient company.
>> Yeah.
I mean, if you think
just of the problem that we
solve, we typically say that a
company that has 6000 suppliers,
which for us it would be a
small customer and $1 billion
in spend, which again, would be
a small customer would be
probably wasting about 8 to $10
million a year just managing
data because everyone's doing
their own thing with the with
the same suppliers and asking
the same suppliers to come into
different places, different
doors in the company.
And so that's just wasting
a lot of time.
And then there's no collective
brain on who do we
do business and where is this
data stored that everyone can
access.
And so there's really
limited visibility into like
how do you optimise an enormous
amount of dollars going through
the company to, you know,
improve your margins or drive
more competitiveness from your
supply base?
>> Okay, David, we've come a
long way with technology,
as we can hear just from from
Tealbook example there.
What effect has the adoption
of technology and AI
had on industrial policy?
>> It can be the object of
industrial policy.
The thing to remember about
information technology over
the last 20 to 30 years,
and now AI, is that it's
transforming virtually
virtually every industry, every
sector of the economy.
There's no sector,
as Stephanie's example makes
really clear,
there's no sector of the
economy that's not touched by
what technology can do.
And now what AI is doing.
We haven't had we've had
policies to support research
on AI.
We've had policies to support
training students to, you know,
learn AI, to program an AI.
But we haven't had an effective
policy to diffuse AI out into
the broader economy.
We haven't had that at
the federal level.
We haven't had it at the
provincial level.
The feds are currently
touting their $2 billion
spend to buy more compute power
for companies to use AI.
Individual US companies
are spending open AI and Nvidia.
These companies are spending
$50 billion a year on on their
compute power.
What we have from the
governments is minuscule.
>> Stephanie.
On that note, the
Ontario government has made
investments in AI
and innovation.
In your view, is there enough
support to ensure industries
like yours can remain
competitive?
>> I'm going to be trying to be
political, so we were involved
in some of the programs that
the government had put in place
around.
AI was a big investment
with millions and millions of
dollars.
We didn't benefit from it.
The the complexity of
navigating the program was so
challenging.
And, and, and there was no
real commercial value.
So as a start-up company,
you know what?
You have time.
You don't have a lot of time
and money runs out.
And so you need to focus
your effort on winning
customers.
And when you add all this
layers of complexity and
who owns the IP and how can
you commercialise the asset
and that's unsure then then
it's losing its purpose
and it doesn't benefit.
Start-up companies like ours.
We've benefited from programs
like shred that gives us tax
benefit from investing in
technology, but it's not
necessarily specific to AI.
And although we are an AI
company based in Toronto,
it's been very difficult
to get funding
and unnecessarily difficult,
I would say, even though
there are programs.
>> What about the private
sector in terms of funding?
>> Yeah, I mean, we're private
company from the government.
I mean, we win customers, right?
And they give us revenue,
and that's how we get.
>> The funding.
Private investors.
>> For VCs, right?
We've we've raised capital.
And so that's helped us
build the technology
to then be able to generate
the revenue.
So those are the two
ways.
But you know having our
government, especially when AI
has been a huge driver for
Canada and we've lost our
position, I think that a lot of
the policies that could have
been in place to accelerate the
Canadian adoption and
investment in AI could have put
us in a much, much more
competitive place globally.
>> All right, David, I'm gonna
get you to pick up on that.
But I should mention we have a
statement from the office of
the Minister of Economic
Development, Job Creation and
Trade.
Our government is creating
the conditions for Ontario's
tech businesses, innovators
and workers to thrive.
To support this growth,
we have invested $107 Million
in Ontario's critical
technologies initiatives to
provide access to and drive the
commercialisation of
technologies that will propel
the next generation of
innovation and ensure our
businesses remain competitive.
That includes support for the
Ontario Centre for innovation
and the Vector Institute.
So with all that being said.
>> The they have done some
things not enough, but the
question is do they have
a strategy?
Do they have a strategy
that everyone understands
that all of the firms
in the relevant sectors
understand?
Is it a strategy that's been
based on input from
those firms?
The economists and policy
experts who study these
things differentiate between
old industrial policy, which
was all top down government
directed, and new industrial
policy, which is much more
participatory, collaborative,
that involves firms in the
sectors that are going to be
affected by the policies in
helping design and implement
them.
We don't do that in this
country, and we certainly don't
do it in this province.
And a lot of what we
do is very reactive.
A company will say,
well, we're interested in
investing in Ontario.
Can you help us?
And then the government will
put together a package
of support, particularly
in the automotive,
but occasionally in other
sectors as well.
But we don't lay out a strategy.
>> Is there a difference in
laying out a strategy or
writing that strategy down on
paper?
Is there a difference in
in having it on paper?
>> It doesn't matter whether
it's on paper or whether it's
digital.
It needs to be communicated
to the people you want to,
you know, attract and and grow
in this jurisdiction.
The other thing that industrial
policy does that one off
individual policies don't do,
it looks at what we call the
policy mix.
That is, what is
the broad spectrum of policy
instruments that the government
has available to it.
Tax policy, direct spending,
regulatory policy, procurement.
And how how do you put
together those
that mix of policies to deliver
the maximum benefit to the
companies that you're trying to
grow in Ontario?
>> All right.
With that being said,
let's take a broader look.
Are there any international
markets that we can compete
with?
>> We can't compete head to
head with China.
We can't compete in
head to head with the US
because of our size,
because the the size of our
companies.
What we can do is target
niche markets where we develop
specific expertise,
which is exactly what Stephanie
is doing.
And there are other
software companies in Canada
and Ontario that are doing the
same thing.
And we need to focus on
those niches where we
have distinctive research
expertise that companies can
take and deploy.
And then we need to look at
the mix of policy instruments
that we can mobilise
to give those companies
the support they need
to penetrate those
international markets.
Because, simply put,
Canada's market is too small
to grow an international
technology company to scale.
>> Can you give us an example?
>> Countries where.
>> We have examples?
>> Yeah, we can be selling to
Europe, we can be selling into
the US.
We can be selling to parts
of East Asia.
We certainly can be selling
a lot more to India than we do.
India is probably the largest,
largest population in the world
now.
So one of the largest markets
are foreign relations with India
have not been the best
for the last few years,
but I believe the government is
working hard to rectify that.
That would be a huge market for
us.
>> Stephanie, what do companies
like yours?
We talk about the niche markets,
smaller markets.
What does your what does
your company need to remain
competitive customers?
>> That's the only thing that
matters, right?
My view is like,
you know, there's a lot of
obviously we have to raise
capital.
In my case, this was a
big investment in the tech.
So we've raised about 70 million
USD.
And so we need to raise
the capital.
But the proof points come
if there's a fit
and you're building a
technology that's solving a
real problem, you win customers.
The customers are paying you
money.
They give you feedback.
You build better product that
attracts more customers, that
gives you money.
And then investors are
really attracted
to your company and then they
build better product.
And so, you know,
the one key driver
and I've said this a lot from
the public sector because we
were really fortunate in Covid.
We won the UK government.
We won.
We worked with the
Department of Defence in the US,
but we never won Canada.
And it was not by lack of
trying, but there's so much
lobbying for the company
and trying to get through
to get a contract or
solve real problems because
supply chain was a real problem
and we were in the UK able to
set them up within 48 hours,
with 60,000 manufacturers of
PPE, ISO certified.
With the history of how long
they've been in business
with their contact information.
And so they could start,
you know, going from being
in the front of the paper,
buying PPE from random companies
to actually making sure that
they're buying companies
that met standards.
And, you know, we try to
advocate to get Canada to look
at us as an opportunity to
start looking for goods and
services and either locally or
outside the Anand.
And it was impossible to
work with our government.
And so there's so much,
you know, effort you want
to put in.
I'm better off winning the
Kraft Heinz of this world
and the, you know,
Goldman Sachs of this world
versus trying to knock on a
door that makes it very
difficult for tech companies to
work with its government.
>> Okay.
We'll come back to that.
David.
>> Can I just follow up on
Stephanie's point?
Because we've interviewed tons
of technology companies in
Ontario, and Stephanie's story
is one that I hear over and
over again.
Okay, we do not.
So so in my field of study, we
differentiate between supply
side industrial policies and
demand side industrial policies.
And one of the most valuable
for for companies, for start up
and scale up companies is
government procurement.
We heard over and over again,
you know, when I go into an
international market, the first
question they ask me is, well,
who are you selling to in your
home country, including your
governments or your telcos or
your banks?
And I hear the story over
and over again that
these companies have to make
their first sale
internationally before they can
get anyone in Canada to pay
attention, and getting their
governments to, to purchase.
And by governments, you know,
we don't just mean the actual
government in Ontario, we mean
the whole college, university,
hospital, social services,
municipal sector as well.
Those are huge purchasers,
the crown corporations,
those are enormous markets.
And if we could leverage
their purchasing power
to support companies like
Stephanie's, we'd be a long way
down the road towards having an
effective industrial policy.
>> Well, we know we're in a
time right now where the
sentiment is sort of changed,
where there is, you know,
elbows up by local.
I want to stick with you, David.
The Buy Ontario Act
for procurement, is this
the right move to support?
>> It's a step in the right
direction.
But but if it's just
if it just applies to the
Ontario government, it doesn't
apply to the broader public
sector in Ontario.
If it is, say, targeted to
housing, that's great
or targeted to infrastructure.
But if it's not targeted to
all sorts of technology
products that the government
itself is using or
that the broader public sector
is using, then it's only,
you know, a first step
towards where we need to go.
>> And just to add to that, we
were talking about the best way
to drive behaviour and change
is through policies.
And we've seen, you know,
in the US, for example,
and I know there's a
love and hate relationship
right now, but a good example
is that companies are driven to
buy local or buy from minority
owned businesses due to tax
incentive, for example, or we
have customers who have venture
debt attached with an interest
rate, depending on how much
money they're spending with
minority owned business and
local businesses.
So these are data points
and report that
they have to provide to their
board level to their
shareholders.
So it does drive change.
But if you don't have
that it's just a sentiment
that's Buy Canada because
we're Canadian.
It doesn't drive change
in the way say, hey, we
will give you tax incentive or
we will, you know, give you
some reduction in some of your,
you know, venture debt so that
you can, you know, to drive
change.
And so that's how I think
we could enforce change.
now Stephanie you're a Canadian
company but most of your clients
in th US correct? That's right
so let's take out sentiment
throw that ar the aside, throw
legislation at the side
even if there was any of that
in place is it still feasible
to do something like that?
In Canada? in Canada
I think so like the policy
making of encouraging Canadian
companies. The public sector
100% because it sets the example
especially if theres
accountability, right
because you can say that but if
there's no accountability
then when we've seen this in the
papers but also from the private
sector, those are the big
dollars as well that are you
know a lot of opportunities
for them to adopt Canadian
tech and that gives us logos and
it gives us customers again
and gives us the ability to
attract talent and hire people
as well so you also get some
additional funding so. Ya I
think absolutely that would be
a huge driver for adopting
local tech, local businesses
and spend here in our country.
>> David, you got the last word
here.
>> Okay.
So we've we've interviewed
over 100 companies in Ontario
that are trying to scale.
So they're at probably
the same stage that Stefanie's
company is they're out of the
gate.
They're past start-up.
They want to grow.
They want to expand
into international markets.
And we asked them,
what do you need in terms of
policy support to help you
scale to penetrate those global
markets?
It's the same three things
over and over again:
access to capital, access to
talent, access to markets and
where.
And we're we have bits
and pieces both federally and
provincially on all of them.
But we don't have nearly enough.
And where in Ontario last word
right now is really deficient.
Is the access to talent part.
Ontario is spending the least
amount per capita on its
post-secondary education system.
It's the students from that
system that are going to go
feed Stefanie's company and
companies like hers.
And if we can't prioritise
the talent pipeline for for
those technology companies,
we are going to have
an even bigger problem
five, ten years down the road
All right, we are going to have
to leave it there.
Stephanie. David,
I really appreciate. Thank you
so much for your insights.
