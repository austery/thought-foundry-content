(Music) Let's talk about a fact first When Buffett was 11 years old He bought the first stock in his life But his current $150 billion wealth 99% of it was earned after he was 50 years old 在很多人眼中啊,致富這件事,似乎要麼是突然飛來橫財,要麼是永遠都不可能發生。但白手起家的富人們都明白一個道理,財富是通過一點一滴,長時間不斷重複的那些小努力積累而成的。 Most people overestimate how much they can do in a year But seriously underestimated their achievements in 20-30 years through persistence and accumulation So we often only see the final result But few people talk about the path to the end Today I will talk about 8 ways most ordinary people don't know how to make money and accumulate wealth These methods and principles may seem simple to you But there are very few people who really understand and do it I also know that the environment is very bad now But that's something we can't change What we can change is to make ourselves better You may have watched many videos trying to tell you how to make money But I think most of these videos are very empty Do you want to teach someone to manage money Did you make money yourself What did you do to manage money You let people act What did you do 所以我這個視頻不同的地方就在於我會用實際案例告訴大家我自己是怎麼做的以及這麼做能夠取得什麼樣的成績這就是所謂的言傳身教用事實來論證道理好 那麼我們開始了普通人不懂的智富之道第一點賺錢靠的不是努力工作而是解決系統性問題 窮人唯一知道的賺錢方式就是工作用自己的時間和精力去交換別人的金錢但真正的價值來自於整合和創造只有當你能夠把一個拼圖上所有的碎片拼湊起來時你才能真正開始賺錢 For example, if you work in a milk tea shop The milk tea shop owner gives you a salary Then you are just one of the milk tea shop's customers No matter how much milk tea this shop sells You can only make so much money The milk tea shop owner is richer than you It's because he has more of the same pieces For example, the raw materials are his The shop is his The employee is his The add-on is his So he should make more money Everyone understands this principle But the point is here In fact, the milk tea shop owner is just a big piece of the puzzle Because the real complete puzzle is in the brand side Mi Xue Bing Cheng, Dawang Tea Chicken and Xi Cha They are the masters of the whole system They are responsible for the supply chain of raw materials Brand packaging, menu design, advertising, marketing, selection and decoration, logistics delivery All the parts are integrated The milk tea shop owner is just a small piece of the whole family system responsible for the final sales This is why in the whole milk tea business The brand has made a big profit The small boss in the family makes a little bit or even a lot of money And the workers are even more insignificant 所以在任何領域當中請記住只有當你能解決系統當中的流程拼圖時你才能真正利用市場的力量讓自己賺到更多的錢甚至變得富有第二點你的收入高度取決於你能多大程度上利用你身邊的工具 Imagine that you only need to bring a hoe back to the primitive society Your productivity will immediately increase ten times more than the people at the time If you take a tractor back Then you will immediately be called a god Because the use of tools can make our production and creation of value Get a great increase But now we have many people who don't use the tools available to improve efficiency Many people spent a few days to buy a phone for tens of thousands of dollars and only use it to play Tiktok and chat with friends Even before the AI revolution in the past two years most people only used 5% of the phone functions 事實上有太多能夠提高我們生產效率的APP你手機上下載了多少個呢?你經常在短視頻裡刷到別人給你推薦一些好用的APP但你收藏了一個又一個卻從來沒有真正去學習如何使用正是收藏從未停止行動從未開始 I used to have millions of fans through short videos From the beginning to the end, I only finished all the work with one phone We often think of tools as things like a hammer and screwdriver But tools are anything that can help us improve productivity So you have to think about what tools are modern people Do you have a good home to use? For example, YouTube is also a tool But some people use YouTube to see the improvement of their cognitive ability Some people spend several hours a day to brush their long legs For example, most people think that Excel is just a tool for simple表格 and calculation But in fact, everyone only uses the function of less than 1% of Excel Excel is a very powerful tool People who really know how to use Excel can use Excel as a data analysis, modeling, visualization, automation and small-scale environmental and integrated all-purpose tool When I was working in the past I built a large number of large-scale automation financial models through Excel With these models the cost of financing is more than RMB 300 million I can't live without Excel I can use it to make financial and investment prediction models, data analysis, record my channel's growth, etc. I will show you the actual case later And the most important tool in the past two years is AI I started using it when I launched CheckGPT 3.5 at the end of 2022 In February 2023, when CheckGPT+ came out, I immediately became a paid user Because I know that even if the intelligence, ability and resources of two people are originally on the same starting line The one with the tool can easily knock down the one without the tool Now CHAT GPT has become an indispensable tool in my investment finance and self-media business I will use it every day From simple check the wrong words to confirm whether the data I use is correct Make my video cover, give me suggestions for the title of the attractor, etc. If you still haven't integrated AI into your daily work or help you make money then in the business battlefield you are still in a rush to charge while others are already starting to open tanks But you don't have to worry As long as you start to use all the tools around you Especially AI It's not too late to use it Because most people are lazy Not willing to go in You can see this video here I believe you have exceeded 90% of the crowd 3. Don't think about saving money but focus on how to make money Poor people always like to be rich spend few hours to watch phone to get some money or to save few dollars to buy a red envelope No matter if your current income is 1 hour 1000 RMB or 1 hour 50 RMB You have no reason to waste 2 hours of your life to save a few hundred RMB If you can earn 1000 RMB per hour, you don't need to save this money If you can only earn 50 RMB per hour Then you should use this time to improve yourself Find a way to make more money Instead of wasting time here to save some money Actually, this is not only for the poor Even for some middle-class people who are already in good financial conditions It's the same I have made this mistake before For example, I want to travel I like a room for 3000 yuan per night But I feel too expensive and heartache I want to find a room for more than 1000 yuan per night Save some money But it doesn't seem to be as satisfying as 3000 yuan So sometimes I struggled for this for a long time I searched on the social media I just want to find a high-end But then I figured it out I went to travel for 10 days Can I change my life with this 10,000 yuan? Can I cross the class? Definitely not What I should do is to continue to improve myself Let me see the room with 5,000 yuan a day I don't blink 所以不管你現在是什麼階層每當你要浪費時間貨幣三家的時候我覺得你只需要問自己兩個問題第一 這個價格我負擔得起嗎?第二 省下這個錢能讓我的生活變得更好嗎?如果你負擔得起並且省下這個錢不能從根本上改變你的人生和階層那麼你就不需要浪費時間去省這個錢 Remember, you can never go out of poverty or cross-border with saving money. You can only use your ability to cross the threshold of the next wealth class. So, if you can only earn 50 dollars an hour, and still have time to study the various ways of double 11 and 618 every day, 那你完全可以抽出時間在YouTube上學習Excel編程、視頻剪輯、AI或者其他能夠提升你在自己領域裡競爭力的東西最後換一份工資高三倍的工作你也可以到閒魚上去研究看看有什麼副業是可以讓你獲得被動收入的 I will tell you another reason The same 50 RMB product Even if it is free You just saved 50 RMB So you have to remember There is a limit to saving money But how much money can you make There is no ceiling 第四點如果你不能在睡覺的時候也在賺錢那麼你永遠都不會富有富人之所以富最重要的就是因為他們有睡後收入睡覺的睡每個人一天都只有24小時8小時睡覺2小時通勤還要吃飯做家務上廁所約會休閒娛樂等等你能用來交易換錢的小時數是非常有限的 So your source of income can't be tied to yourself This is why I mentioned earlier The mindset of solving the system puzzle is so important Unless you can really control your time Otherwise, you will always be poor When you put your money in the financial products to make a profit This is the tax income The house tax, the share price is also tax income But of course, these are what you must have money to own So the key is You need to make money through other people's time We said that someone is good at cutting hair So the business is particularly good He can also collect high prices Cutting hair once costs 500 yuan But he needs to spend an average of one hour to wash and cut each customer He works 10 hours a day Only one day off every week Even so He can only make 120,000 a month 1,144,000 a year The deduction of the house rent water power coal may also be 1 million This is a lot of money for ordinary people But this is the top person who can do it in one go Most hair stylists cut a hair, let alone 500 yuan It's good if the boss can give him 100 yuan But even if this top hair stylist Like a bull horse, 996 His income ceiling is more than 1 million a year Because he can only sell his own time If he wants to make a lot of money He must turn himself into a brand For example, Tony Then everyone has to use his name to open a store The monthly income must be divided into him So when dozens of stores are opened all over the country Tony hair salon When thousands of hair stylists are applied all over the country Everyone is using their own time to help others with hair styling Are all helping him make money All the people who are the boss are basically using other people's time to help themselves make money I give you the example of milk tea shop The milk tea shop boss makes money through the time of shop staff The brand house makes money through the time of thousands of small bosses across the country 除了雇人以外還有別的渠道是可以產生稅後收入的比如說YouTube博主因為YouTube視頻是只要有人看就會產生收入那麼當我把視頻上傳了之後我跑去睡覺別人在看視頻的時候我也會有收入 If you don't hire a boss, you can also make a tax-payment method. For example, write an article and apply to a direct payment platform, publish a book, create a small app that others are willing to use, small game, small program, or make WeChat payment emoticons, microphones, etc. Of course, many people can't do these. Don't worry, I will tell you more about tax-payment later. 5. The accumulation of wealth is like a wall of gas It is piled up piece by piece Many people have a kind of fantasy of revenge overnight Buy a lottery, win a big prize Grab the chance to fall from the sky Can never be at peace forever But this idea makes them never be rich Because they don't understand how wealth is built 事實上有沒有因為運氣好突然報復的人當然有就像還有人被雷劈死被倒下來的自動販賣機壓死我們去看這些極少數的特例是沒有意義的而且那些靠運氣獲得的錢大概率也會憑實力虧回去要改變自己的人生財富絕對不能依賴運氣而是靠一點一滴的長期積累 If you carefully observe the way the poor people treat money You will find that when they spend hundreds of dollars to buy something completely unnecessary Never hesitate But when you hear that you earn hundreds of dollars One or two hundred dollars will be worth it If you think the money is too little, it is not worth it Many people have not realized that even a few hundred dollars Can also start building tax revenue The easiest way is to buy those high-quality stocks that are fixed to release pink. In addition, I have also given suggestions before. If you have free money, you should buy the ETF index fund of Nasdaq or BiaoPo 500. This long-term stable growth of the neutral index fund is also a kind of tax revenue. 就算你不去研究如何在境外平台买美股我在以前的节目里说过了支付宝上面就可以购买这些ETM最低100块人民币就能投马来西亚的Touch and Go里也有不错的理财产品我相信很多国家都有 Don't underestimate 100 dollars Do you remember the story I told in the beginning of the video? Buffett bought the stock for 40 years But now he has 99% of the wealth It was only earned after he was 50 years old This is the power of the negative effect The earlier you start The more powerful the negative effect is You don't have to invest a lot of money at the beginning The key is to get used to it Put a little bit of free money in slowly For example, you can set up a deposit on Alipay After I gave a suggestion in the program a year ago Some fans told me They set up a deposit of 100 yuan per day No need to care about it I was the one who suggested last year If people who listen to me even if they put in only 1000 RMB every month they have accumulated more than 10,000 RMB by now Not to mention that Nasdaq has increased by 25% in the past year Isn't this much better than paying social security? 就算美股短期下跌了也不要害怕跌了反而是買入的好時機這是一個過去40年來上漲了7200%的市場你要堅持的是一個長期主義看的是20年30年的積累 That's all for today, I want to share a story I have a fan who sent me a message I want to give her some life advice This little girl is a junior in Peking University She is a visual arts student Her mother also hopes that she can work in the factory after graduation and be more stable But this little girl has been a fan of painting since she was a child Many people like painting as a hobby But she started to look for opportunities online from the first grade And she also promoted herself through self-media Through private contracts She can earn more than 2000 yuan a month from the first grade Now she can earn more than 10,000 yuan a month So you see, drawing is not his profession But this is a skill he has accumulated over 9 years He has been practicing drawing for more than 6 years This is what I said, improve his ability He is now using his own efforts and modern tools Not only can he get over 10,000 when he is in college And he is not going to the factory to be a bulldozer after graduation But to do this whole job And then through self-media to expand his reputation To solve more problems Ask me if I support Of course I support Because the most difficult and the happiest thing in the world Is to make money through your own interest I know that you will definitely see this video If he wants to get closer in the future He has to improve his business ability By establishing his own fame He can set up a studio, hire employees, and run a brand And finally achieve his income But all of this If he didn't go through the 9-year-long 1.1D accumulation All of this can only be a stage of fantasy Remember, the wall of air has to be stacked up one by one The same goes for wealth accumulation If you want to get rid of the phenomenon Not only to improve your awareness of all the tools available More importantly, you have to start to act Use the knowledge you have learned This is the sixth point I want to say All the ideas that lack long-term execution Not worth a penny You can stop bragging about your valuable business idea Everyone has an idea You can just pull a person on the street He can say a few business ideas that he thinks can make a lot of money Then you ask him why he hasn't made a fortune He will tell you all kinds of reasons and excuses Because I don't have time Because his father is not Li Jiacheng Because capital doesn't let the poor have a chance to turn over Bala Bala 我來告訴你一個公式執行力乘點子價值等於最終價值就算你的idea價值5000萬但執行力為0那麼0乘以5000萬還是等於0 執行力是你的點子價值的放大器也就是說一個普通的idea只要執行的夠好就能打敗絕大多數人為什麼星巴克是世界賣的最好的咖啡他家的咖啡也沒有特別好喝呀牛奶加咖啡本身根本就不是一個價值一千億美金的點子但關鍵就在於他們一路上解決的難題以及他們執行計劃的方式勝過了所有人 而關於執行力的重要性別忘了更重要的是前面的那兩個字長期長期的堅持不懈的執行力才是任何點子成功的基本要素第七點千萬不要借那種不能幫你賺錢的錢 First of all, loans are no problem If you have the money to loan, it can help you earn more money This is the only reason to lend But now many young people are in debt to spend money in advance From the earliest time of payment, the payment is in full swing Now in China, almost every app provides a loan service Whether it is a shopping platform, take-out, taxi, or short video As long as there are 4 apps, you can provide loans And these loans are very high At the lowest, it takes 15% to 24% interest per year And the more terrible thing is the very popular cash loan a few years ago The so-called 714 high bubble Lend 1000 yuan, one week's interest is 200 yuan This is equivalent to 80% per month A year's close to 1000% interest 你可能不相信,但這樣的貸款同樣供不應求當年我在上海曾經也幫人設計和操作過現金貸APP所以我非常了解你都無法相信這些人藉如此高利息的錢來幹什麼買手機、買包包、買遊戲裡的裝備、賭博、打麻將等等 Once our customer service received a call A young lady borrowed 3000 RMB called to urge Why don't you pay? She is still in the store She has already picked the bag Just waiting to pay down Borrow 3000 RMB to buy a bag Her interest per week is 600 RMB Can you imagine? 借钱来消费就是一个无底洞这些贷款只有消耗无法为你创造任何价值再加上利滚力只要一陷进去了基本就很难再反省为什么KTV里按摩院里那么多年轻漂亮的小姑娘为什么Onlyfans这种黄色自媒体平台那么火绝大部分都是因为欠债 Of course, what you need to pay attention to is that not all loans are bad If the loan is used to make money, it will have a strong impact and greatly improve the return on investment For example, when the Chinese real estate market was still very good ten years ago I also borrowed tens of millions of real estate loans Two years ago, I sold all the Shanghai houses Now I use the money to invest in Singapore I still borrowed more than $1 million from the bank What do I do with the money? Because I have analyzed the market and saw the opportunity I borrowed from the bank The Swiss Falan, which has less than 1% annual rate And the Lean RMB, which has less than 2% annual rate In exchange for the US dollar to invest in annual income 8% to 15% of fixed-year-old income products Even a regular deposit of US dollars with zero risk Can also have 4% of income This interest difference is the money dropped from the sky 這些也從來沒有人指導過我如我上面所說的要自己行動起來去研究市場提升認知去善用自己身邊所有的工具你才能賺到錢好了那麼就來到了最後一點這是我相信你沒有在任何地方聽到過的一點但卻是我本人非常確信的第八點用記錄和追蹤來為自己指明方向 If you set a goal, you need to keep the habit of recording and tracking For example, you want to lose weight, you should record what you eat every day How long you have been doing exercise and weight change Similarly, if you want to make more money, you can record how much you have earned this month How much money spent How much did you invest this month How much loss How far away from the goal etc. 一旦你把過程記錄下來你就能清楚的看到自己正在做的事情到底有沒有帶來改變在我看來這種記錄是非常有意義的它能讓你變得更有動力當你看著你每天體重的變化越來越接近目標時會讓你更加不容易放棄當你看著你每個月又多賺了多少錢時你就會去想更多的辦法來賺更多的錢 记录过程也能让我们看到自己目前的赞助当中有什么错误并及时做出调整比如原本每个月都能减3公斤的这个月突然体重没有变化了那么你可以从自己的记录当中去看本月我吃了什么运动规律是否有改变如果你这个月存下来的钱变少了你就可以追溯是什么原因是投资项目选错了还是自己乱花钱了等等 Most people live by feeling They think things will get better The bridgehead of the ship is the point But if a company doesn't follow the company's performance The performance and quality of the product are constantly improving Do you think this company can survive in the commercial competition? 公司是这样那么放到个人身上也是一样的你能够赚多少钱也是基于你跟世上其他人的竞争你不想办法了解自己的表现并且不断的改进你同样无法在人生的战场中胜出 有些人可能覺得這也太累了吧根本就不現實老周你也就是講講大道理吧你真的自己做記錄嗎我說過了我是言傳身教我自己做不到的事我不會拿出來跟你們講所以接下來我讓大家看看我都做了哪些記錄 現在我人生大部分的時間就花在兩件事上投資理財以及我的自媒體事業這兩件事我都有非常詳細的Excel記錄我的進展和目標先看看投資理財首先你可以看到有那麼多張工作頁我們挑幾頁重要的看一看 比如这页 FCM这是我投资的一种固售产品这里记录了每一个我正在投资的项目是不是眼花缭乱这是股票名称一些相关的价格参数 日期 收益进展等等 这也是已经结束的项目你更加看不过来但其实这只是我过去一年的记录而已更重要的是我把自己的投资当成一家企业来对待给自己做了企业级别的财务报表这是资产负债表损益表现金流量表还有很多很多比如这是负债名系这是每次的换汇记录等等的 Alright, this is the investment and finance part Also, there is my self-media career Although self-media is not my main source of income But it is the place where I really invest a lot of time and passion It is my passion I want to express my views to the world I want to help others and change the world through my own knowledge and values I do not deny that there is also a force that does not give up The goal I set for myself is to become a blogger with millions of fans From the beginning, I recorded how many fans I have gained every day This is the date, this is the number of fans at the end of the day This is how many fans I have gained that day How many fans have been gained in the past week How many fans have been gained in the past 30 days And how many fans have been gained on average every day in the past 30 days I also added new data recently I watched the amount and hours and income in the past month I decided to start YouTube from March last year I record every day No matter sick, traveling, or tired No matter how many fans From more than 4,000 fans in March last year It has reached 400,000 fans today I also made the same record on Twitter Not only that, to encourage myself, I also made a live stream for myself since June last year. Every month, I also recorded some of the number of fans on YouTube, and how many fans have increased in the month. 比如說去年6月1號的時候我有5.9萬分5月散人有30.8萬分到6月30號的時候我變成了9.3萬當月漲了3.4萬分5月散人變成30.9萬分當月漲了1000分 I told myself when I recorded One day I want to surpass all of them When I surpass someone I will mark the anchor in the month For example, I surpassed Wang Wai-Jue in August last year This year, I surpassed Fang De-Yan in February This year, I surpassed Sydney Nibba and Wu Yue-San in July this year Isn't this a fight or something? I didn't have a festival with these anchors Some are even friends This is just a way for me to encourage myself to keep working hard I spent more time on this part because I think it is important to convince others what is not important more important is what I have done I want to prove to you the methods I told you are all real you just need to work hard and persist 好了今天講的這些都是我自己的壓箱寶物現在無償拿出來跟大家分享我希望哪怕只要其中有一點能夠觸動到你激發你的靈感並且行動起來那都能夠一生受用 最后如果你觉得这个视频帮助到你的我希望你能做两件事第一就是在评论区告诉我哪一点对你而言最有价值第二当然就是点赞订阅更重要的是分享给你身边所有的家人和朋友们让他们也行动起来祝大家都能在人生路上披荆斩棘越来越好我是老周横眉冷对直言不讳我们下期再见
