 Automation


works
 well
 when
 there
 is
 an
 army
 of


people
 behind
 it.
 Today's
 story
 is
 about


five
 failed
 AI
 pivots
 where
 product
 bets


were
 hit
 with
 physics,
 market
 reality,


and
 margins.
 We
 will
 study
 five
 big


cases
 where
 the
 unit
 economics
 snapped


and
 the
 product
 failed
 and
 figure
 out


what
 we
 can
 learn
 from
 them.
 Let's
 dive


in.


Amazon's
 just
 walk
 out
 was
 supposed
 to


be
 a
 checkout
 free
 project
 at
 grocery


and
 convenience
 stores.
 The
 idea
 was
 to


let
 customers
 enter
 a
 store,
 pick
 up
 the


items,
 and
 leave
 without
 scanning


anything
 or
 stopping
 to
 pay
 at
 the
 till.


The
 project
 launched
 in
 2018,
 and
 later


on
 they
 rolled
 it
 out
 in
 Amazon
 Go
 and


Amazon
 Fresh
 stores.
 The
 idea
 was
 to


create
 a
 new
 age
 frictionless
 shopping


experience.
 The
 Just
 Walk
 Out
 project


was
 the
 first
 example
 of
 a
 massive


investment
 in
 AI
 retail
 automation,
 but


nevertheless,
 the
 company
 retired
 the


system
 from
 its
 stores
 in
 2024.


Let's
 understand
 why.
 Amazon
 reportedly


spend
 around
 $1
 million
 annually
 on
 Just


Walkout
 between
 2019
 and
 2020.
 This


investment
 covered
 all
 R&D
 and
 capital


expenses.
 Now,
 how
 much
 is
 it?
 a
 billion


dollars.
 Is
 it
 a
 lot
 or
 is
 it
 a
 little?


The
 implementation
 of
 this
 system
 in


large
 supermarkets
 required
 from
 10
 to


15
 million
 per
 store,
 which
 is
 far
 above


traditional
 checkout
 systems.
 Behind
 the


automation
 curtain,
 Amazon
 hired
 more


than
 1,000
 people
 in
 India
 labeling


videos
 in
 real
 time.
 That
 human
 layer


kept
 things
 accurate,
 but
 it
 also


destroyed
 the
 margins.
 The
 cost
 of


processing
 data
 and
 fixing
 mistakes


outpaced
 a
 normal
 retail
 operation,


especially
 in
 big
 box
 stores
 with


complex
 product
 mixes.
 It
 is
 a
 lot


easier
 to
 implement
 a
 system
 like
 this


at
 a
 convenience
 store
 like
 Amazon
 Go
 or


Amazon
 Fresh.
 And
 the
 reason
 for
 that
 is


because
 the
 product
 mix
 and
 the
 possible


combination
 of
 products
 at
 those
 stores


are
 quite
 limited.
 Now,
 if
 you
 think


about
 a
 store
 like
 Walmart,
 for
 example,


you
 can
 get
 a
 few
 tomatoes
 that
 need
 to


be
 weighted.
 You
 can
 get
 a
 box
 of


tomatoes
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 scanned
 and


perhaps
 a
 pillow
 that
 is
 25%
 off
 if
 you


get
 a
 toaster
 by
 the
 end
 of
 the
 week.


When
 you
 work
 with
 a
 product
 mix
 like


that,
 and
 that's
 just
 a
 tiny
 example,


Amazon's
 just
 walk
 out
 starts
 to
 produce


a
 lot
 of
 errors,
 which
 is
 why
 they


struggled
 with
 the
 adoption
 among
 the


large
 stores.
 It
 was
 estimated
 that
 up


to
 70%
 of
 transactions
 required
 human


intervention.
 The
 labor
 cost
 savings


expected
 from
 removing
 cashiers
 were


wiped
 out
 by
 the
 substantial
 off-site


human
 operation.
 And
 if
 you
 think
 about


it,
 the
 need
 to
 have
 the
 humans
 behind


it
 really
 defeats
 the
 purpose
 of


automation
 in
 the
 first
 place.
 The


project
 also
 required
 lots
 of
 hardware,


thousands
 of
 cameras,
 shelf
 sensors,
 a


backend
 infrastructure
 for
 computer


vision
 and
 AI,
 all
 of
 which
 resulted
 in


high
 setup
 and
 maintenance
 costs.
 In


this
 business
 model,
 stores
 would
 have


needed
 to
 dramatically
 increase
 sales
 to


offset
 capital
 and
 operational
 expenses.


And
 that
 was
 the
 threshold
 that
 Amazon


never
 met.
 The
 end
 result,
 Amazon


continues
 using
 this
 project
 and
 smaller


Amazon
 Go
 stores,
 but
 they
 have


abandoned
 the
 grocery
 store
 application.


You
 know
 how
 every
 meeting
 ends
 in
 the


same
 way.
 10
 people
 nod,
 three
 people


take
 notes,
 and
 only
 one
 remembers
 what


got
 decided.
 If
 you're
 lucky,
 you
 might


say,
 "But
 costs
 get
 recorded."
 Now,


sure,
 if
 you're
 paying
 for
 those


recordings,
 and
 even
 if
 you
 do,
 what


happens
 after?
 You've
 got
 a
 pile
 of
 text


that
 you
 still
 need
 to
 do
 something


with,
 creating
 action
 items,
 updating


tickets,
 drafting
 follow-ups,
 or


cleaning
 up
 the
 chaos.
 And
 this
 is
 why


we
 partnered
 with
 Radiant,
 because
 in
 a


world
 where
 you're
 paying
 for
 every


single
 app,
 the
 smartest
 move
 is
 to
 pay


for
 one
 that
 replaces
 five.
 And
 Radiant


is
 actually
 totally
 free
 while
 it's
 in


beta,
 so
 you
 don't
 have
 to
 pay
 for


anything
 at
 all.
 I
 personally
 love
 tools


that
 work
 across
 multiple
 platforms.


It's
 a
 lot
 cleaner.
 It
 gets
 you
 the
 best


value
 for
 your
 money,
 and
 you
 don't
 have


to
 remember
 which
 app
 handles
 what.


Radiant
 is
 an
 AI
 meeting
 assistant
 that


captures
 your
 calls,
 converts
 them
 into


notes,
 and
 then
 turns
 those
 notes
 into


completed
 actions.
 Slack
 messages,


project
 updates,
 backlog
 tickets,


drafted
 documents,
 and
 even
 prototypes.


And
 it
 works
 across
 Zoom,
 Teams,
 Google


Meet,
 Notion,
 Cursor,
 Lovable,
 Asana,


ClickUp,
 and
 so
 many
 more.
 So
 your


follow-ups
 appear
 exactly
 where
 you


already
 work.
 Radiant
 is
 not
 a
 bot
 that


joins
 your
 calls.
 It
 runs
 silently
 in


the
 background
 and
 stores
 your


transcripts
 locally
 for
 privacy
 so
 that


they
 never
 leave
 your
 device.
 Radiant


takes
 care
 of
 the
 admin
 work
 that
 drains


your
 time.
 And
 instead
 of
 dumping
 a
 pile


of
 text
 on
 you
 after
 the
 meeting,
 it


immediately
 takes
 action.
 It's
 available


for
 M1
 and
 newer
 Macs.
 And
 it
 already


feels
 like
 a
 glimpse
 of
 what
 future
 of


workplace
 AI
 should
 feel
 like.


Multi-functional,
 crossplatform,


invisible,
 and
 secure.
 So,
 if
 you
 want


to
 know
 what
 it
 feels
 like
 to
 have
 your


meetings
 end
 and
 your
 work
 is
 already


done,
 check
 out
 Radiant
 using
 the

below.
 No
 bots,
 no
 setups,
 just
 results.


Huge
 thanks
 to
 Radiant
 for
 sponsoring


this
 part
 of
 the
 video.


Moving
 on
 to
 IBM's
 Watson
 Health.
 IBM's


Watson
 Health
 is
 perhaps
 the
 most


expensive
 AI
 pivot
 failure
 in
 corporate


history.
 The
 one
 that
 has
 burned
 through


four
 to
 five
 billion
 dollars
 in
 cash


over
 a
 decade.
 And
 in
 the
 end,
 it
 ended


up
 being
 sold
 for
 a
 fraction
 of
 the


money
 that
 was
 invested.
 IBM
 is
 an


example
 of
 how
 AI
 marketing
 can
 outpace


technological
 reality.
 IBM's
 failure
 is


rooted
 in
 extremely
 high
 operational


costs,
 deeply
 flawed
 unit
 economics,
 and


glaring
 gaps
 between
 AI
 promise
 and


practical
 medical
 results.
 IBM


positioned
 its
 product
 Watson
 as
 a


revolutionary
 cancer
 diagnosis


technology.
 They
 also
 partnered
 with
 MD


Anderson
 Cancer
 Center.
 Now,
 if
 you


aren't
 familiar
 with
 the
 world
 of
 cancer


care,
 MD
 Anderson
 is
 a
 pretty
 big
 deal.


The
 promise
 was
 ambitious.
 AI
 that
 could


analyze
 vast
 amounts
 of
 medical


literature
 and
 patient
 data
 to
 recommend


personalized
 and
 tailored
 cancer
 care.


Onto
 the
 unit
 economics
 and
 costs.
 IBM


spent
 an
 estimated
 $5
 billion
 on


healthcare
 acquisitions.
 And
 that
 was


done
 with
 a
 goal
 to
 feed
 Watson's
 AI


engine
 with
 data.
 At
 its
 peak,
 Watson


Health
 employed
 more
 than
 7,000
 people


of
 various
 medical
 and
 scientific


specialties,
 which
 meant
 a
 massive
 fixed


cost
 spent
 in
 salaries,
 technical
 teams,


and
 support
 staff.
 Watson's
 cost
 per
 one


oncology
 diagnosis
 or
 support
 case
 was


reportedly
 much
 higher
 than
 usual.
 And


on
 the
 consumer
 side,
 consumer
 being
 a


hospital,
 the
 product
 ended
 up
 being


very
 expensive
 to
 purchase
 and
 maintain


with
 no
 clear
 ROI
 and
 most
 importantly


no
 proven
 clinical
 benefit.
 The
 MD


Anderson
 Cancer
 Care
 Partnership
 alone


consumed
 $62
 million
 without
 producing
 a


deployable
 product.
 Watson
 Health's


implementation
 at
 hospitals
 was
 often
 in


the
 millions
 per
 contract
 but
 required


additional
 budget
 for
 ongoing
 support


customization
 and
 integration
 with


electronic
 health
 records
 and
 electronic


health
 records
 is
 the
 backbone
 of
 any


hospital.
 Most
 hospital
 deployments


required
 custom
 configuration
 because


Watson
 struggled
 with
 unstructured


patient
 data.
 System
 costs
 grew
 faster


than
 revenues.
 IBM
 never
 scaled
 Watson


Health
 to
 profitability.
 Their
 peak


financial
 performance
 was
 when
 they


broke
 even
 by
 slashing
 jobs
 and


eventually
 selling
 the
 unit
 for
 about
 $1


billion,
 which
 is
 the
 loss
 of
 about
 80%


of
 investment.
 So
 why
 did
 it
 fail?


What's
 in
 health
 is
 an
 example
 of
 a


fundamental
 misalignment
 between
 AI


expectations
 and
 the
 reality
 of
 a


medical
 practice.
 IBM's
 marketing


promised
 revolutionary
 breakthroughs
 the


technology
 couldn't
 deliver.
 They
 did


not
 account
 for
 realworld
 messy
 patient


records
 and
 contextrich
 doctor's
 notes.


Watson
 could
 only
 analyze
 well


ststructured
 data.
 A
 minority
 at
 most


hospital
 databases.
 Doctors,
 the


ultimate
 users
 of
 Watson,
 found
 it
 hard


to
 use
 and
 often
 preferred
 their
 own


expertise.
 All
 of
 this
 resulted
 in
 many


abandoned
 deployments
 after
 months
 of


frustration
 with
 complicated
 interfaces


and
 most
 importantly
 unreliable


recommendation
 system.
 And
 on
 top
 of


that,
 privacy
 concerns
 and
 multiaceted


healthcare
 laws
 were
 not
 addressed
 by


the
 product.
 In
 the
 meantime,
 Oracle
 and


Microsoft
 took
 advantage
 of
 the
 fact


that
 IBM
 was
 distracted
 by
 Watson's


complexity
 and
 issues
 and
 decided
 to


make
 large
 and
 focused
 acquisitions
 that


yielded
 clear
 enterprise
 value.
 End


result,
 by
 2021,
 Watson
 Health
 became


unprofitable,
 which
 prompted
 IBM
 to
 sell


it.
 All
 in
 all,
 what's
 in
 health


enormous
 losses
 were
 a
 result
 of


unrealistic
 expectations
 from
 AI,


unchecked
 spending,
 hight
 touch


implementations,
 and
 AI
 that
 never


matched
 its
 marketing
 narrative,
 and
 the


needs
 of
 clinical
 medicine.


Moving
 on
 to
 Netflix,
 AI
 content


upscaling.
 In
 early
 2025,
 Netflix
 pushed


to
 use
 AI
 for
 content
 enhancement
 and


upscaling,
 which
 draw
 a
 lot
 of
 attention


and
 multiple
 controversies,
 especially


around
 the
 mangled
 restoration
 of


classic
 shows.
 Customer
 backlash
 has


been
 intense
 and
 on
 top
 of
 this,
 their


use
 of
 AI
 triggered
 broader
 questions


raised
 about
 the
 role
 of
 artificial


intelligence
 in
 media
 and
 specifically


in
 media
 preservation,
 content
 quality,


and
 authenticity.
 Netflix
 is
 a
 prime


example
 of
 PR
 crisis
 around
 AI.
 Let's


look
 at
 what
 happened.
 Netflix
 used
 AI


upscaling
 to
 convert
 older,
 lower


resolution
 television
 shows
 to
 high


definition,
 notably
 A
 different
 world.


What
 they
 did
 is
 that
 they
 bypassed


traditional
 manual
 remastering
 that


requires
 original
 film
 negatives
 and


detailed
 human
 restoration
 work.
 The


goal
 behind
 this
 move
 was
 rapid,


cost-effective
 restoration
 of
 old
 film.


But
 as
 it
 turned
 out,
 AI
 really


struggled
 with
 grainy
 source
 materials.


It
 produced
 lots
 of
 distorted
 visuals,


blurred
 faces,
 overly
 smooth
 textures,


and
 extremely
 distorted
 and
 unrealistic


backgrounds.
 Netflix
 also
 faced
 massive


backlash
 when
 fans
 discovered
 AI


generated
 promotional
 posters
 for
 Arcane


season
 2.
 Those
 posters
 included


telltale
 signs
 of
 artificial
 generation


included
 distorted
 anatomy
 and
 unnatural


details.
 The
 controversy
 reached
 6


million
 viewers
 and
 forced
 Netflix
 to


remove
 the
 content.
 In
 Netflix's
 case,


unlike
 Amazon
 Just
 Walk
 Out
 or
 IBM


Watson,
 it's
 less
 about
 lost
 revenue
 or


burned
 cash
 and
 a
 lot
 more
 about
 damaged


customer
 trust
 and
 brand
 perception.


Let's
 go
 through
 the
 unit
 economics
 of


this
 move.
 If
 we
 put
 ourselves
 in
 the


shoes
 of
 Netflix
 and
 look
 at
 it
 from
 the


business
 perspective,
 it
 makes
 sense
 to


try
 AI
 and
 use
 it
 for
 content
 upscaling


because
 manual
 remastering
 is
 very


expensive
 and
 slow.
 And
 if
 there
 is
 a


part
 of
 it
 that
 can
 be
 restored
 by
 a


model
 so
 you
 can
 delegate
 the
 most


delicate
 work
 to
 an
 experienced


professional,
 why
 not
 do
 it?
 AI


upscaling
 can
 process
 large
 libraries
 at


scale
 with
 minimum
 labor.
 Netflix


invested
 heavily
 in
 machine
 learning
 for


video
 restoration
 and
 the
 key
 goal
 was


to
 reduce
 the
 per
 title
 cost.
 But
 in
 my


opinion,
 it's
 one
 of
 those
 things
 that


need
 to
 be
 done
 in
 a
 waterfall
 sequence.


It
 only
 works
 when
 it's
 done
 well


because
 when
 it
 fails,
 the
 brand
 damage


and
 customer
 dissatisfaction
 offset


those
 savings
 10fold.
 So
 why
 did
 it


fail?
 The
 models
 that
 Netflix
 deployed


couldn't
 faithfully
 recreate
 the


artistic
 intent,
 colors,
 or
 subtle


details
 of
 the
 original
 footage.
 Instead


of
 enhancing
 nostalgia,
 that
 is
 actually


very
 much
 a
 trend,
 especially
 among
 Gen


Z,
 with
 non-conforming
 anti-perfect


aesthetics,
 it
 alienated
 longtime
 fans.


Another
 curious
 thing
 is
 that
 the


critical
 flaws
 with
 the
 upscaled
 content


like
 garble
 text,
 cut
 off
 scenes,


blurred
 faces,
 all
 of
 them
 pass


Netflix's
 quality
 checks.
 And
 that
 in


turn
 signals
 extreme
 over
 reliance
 on


algorithmic
 solutions
 and
 the
 absolute


need
 for
 human
 oversight.
 AI
 was
 used


not
 just
 in
 upscaling
 but
 also
 to


manipulate
 actors
 mouth
 movements
 and


dubbed
 films
 which
 in
 turn
 raised


broader
 ethical
 concerns
 over
 artistic


integrity
 and
 performer
 rights.
 This
 was


not
 the
 first
 time
 when
 Netflix
 faced


backlash
 for
 AI
 generated
 visuals
 in


original
 documentaries
 and
 marketing


which
 they
 did
 not
 adequately
 address.


All
 in
 all,
 to
 me,
 this
 is
 a
 PR
 failure,


even
 more
 so
 than
 the
 technical.


Technical,
 too,
 for
 sure,
 but
 mostly
 PR.


This
 entire
 situation
 has
 triggered


industry-wide
 debate
 on
 the
 limits
 of


automation
 in
 creative
 media.
 So,
 this


is
 a
 lot
 more
 than
 just
 Netflix,
 meaning


this
 whole
 situation
 had
 an


industry-wide
 impact.


Moving
 on
 to
 Zoom
 Pizza.
 Zoom
 Pizza
 was


an
 ambitious
 softbankbacked


startup
 whose
 ambition
 was
 to


revolutionize
 pizza
 delivery.
 Their


vision
 was
 to
 cook
 pizzas
 inside
 trucks


and
 deliver
 them
 to
 customers
 homes
 much


faster
 than
 any
 other
 traditional
 pizza


chain.
 Trucks
 were
 filled
 with
 dozens
 of


internet
 connected
 ovens.
 Orders
 were


placed
 through
 the
 app.
 Ingredients
 and


toppings
 were
 robotically
 assembled,


although
 some
 human
 workers
 did
 some


prep.
 And
 pizzas
 were
 cooked
 just
 before


delivery
 arrival.
 The
 goal
 was
 maximum


freshness
 and
 efficiency.
 But
 there
 was


one
 painfully
 simple
 problem
 that
 sort


of
 killed
 the
 business.
 Cheese
 kept


sliding
 off
 pizzas
 while
 they
 were


cooked
 and
 moving
 trucks.
 If
 you're


thinking
 that
 it
 doesn't
 sound
 like
 a


big
 problem,
 why
 close
 the
 entire


business
 because
 of
 the
 cheese?
 I'd
 like


to
 argue
 and
 say
 that
 on
 the
 surface
 it


actually
 does
 sound
 like
 a
 good
 idea.
 I


understand
 why
 they
 got
 funding,
 but
 I


would
 like
 to
 invite
 you
 to
 play
 product


management
 101
 with
 me
 and
 really


understand
 the
 problem.
 But
 before
 we
 go


there,
 unit
 economics
 and
 cost


breakdown.
 Zoom's
 entire
 automation
 bet


was
 based
 on
 staggering
 capital
 and


operational
 costs
 in
 an
 industry
 known


for
 very
 tight
 margins.
 They
 raised
 $445


million
 from
 Soft
 Bank,
 but
 they
 did
 not


do
 a
 due
 diligence
 calculating


operational
 costs.
 Zoom
 had
 one


fundamental
 flaw.
 Despite
 hundreds
 of


millions
 in
 funding
 and
 teams
 of


engineers,
 Zoom
 forgot
 about
 the
 physics


of
 cooking
 pizza
 and
 moving
 vehicles.


And
 when
 the
 business
 began
 operating,


the
 cheese
 was
 simply
 sliding
 off.
 They


had
 teams
 of
 engineers
 trying
 to
 solve


the
 cheese
 problem
 after
 years
 of
 R&D.


But
 the
 entire
 operation
 got
 essentially


defeated
 by
 simple
 physics
 and
 realworld


conditions
 that
 robots
 could
 not


overcome.
 Zoom's
 trucks
 cost
 millions
 to


design
 and
 build.
 with
 each
 truck


fitting
 56
 mini
 ovens
 and
 was
 supplied


with
 highly
 advanced
 GPS-driven


scheduling.
 Now,
 I
 haven't
 found
 a
 lot


of
 data
 on
 the
 whole
 thermo
 isolation


piece
 of
 it.
 But
 can
 you
 imagine
 having


a
 truck
 full
 of
 gas
 with
 56
 working


ovens
 inside
 of
 it?
 Ingredient
 costs


were
 around
 $6
 per
 pizza
 and
 the
 selling


price
 was
 set
 at
 $18
 or
 more
 per
 pizza.


Now,
 the
 price,
 in
 my
 opinion,
 is


actually
 quite
 competitive.
 Yeah,
 it's


not
 cheap,
 but
 it
 is
 a
 typical
 price
 of


a
 restaurant
 quality
 pizza.
 Soft
 Bank


invested
 $375
 million
 in
 2018
 and
 valued


Zoom
 at
 $2.25
 billion
 based
 on
 visions


of
 becoming
 the
 Amazon
 of
 pizzas.
 They


saw
 Zoom
 as
 part
 of
 their
 strategic


portfolio
 alongside
 food
 delivery


companies
 like
 Uber.
 Now,
 Zoom
 had
 other


investors
 as
 well,
 but
 the
 largest
 sum


came
 from
 SoftBank.
 For
 Soft
 Bank,
 the


investment
 became
 a
 complete
 loss


because
 Zoom
 shut
 down
 in
 2023.
 They


tried
 to
 make
 a
 pivot
 by
 2020.
 They


abandoned
 the
 pizza
 delivery
 service
 as


a
 whole
 and
 pivoted
 to
 sustainable


packaging
 manufacturing
 using
 the
 very


robots
 that
 they
 already
 paid
 for.


Investor
 pressure,
 especially
 from
 Soft


Bank,
 led
 them
 to
 scale
 prematurely
 and


make
 an
 aggressive
 pivot
 into
 unrelated


packaging
 and
 logistics
 industry,
 which


kept
 burning
 cash
 without
 any
 sight
 of


product
 market
 fit.
 End
 result,
 Zoom's


failure
 demonstrates
 how
 fundamental


physics
 can
 defeat
 all
 kinds
 of


sophisticated
 AI
 and
 robots.
 Now,
 let's


come
 back
 to
 Product
 Management
 101
 for


a
 second
 and
 realize
 that
 they
 created
 a


business
 around
 a
 problem
 that
 didn't


really
 exist.
 When
 doing
 research
 for


this
 video,
 I
 found
 this
 awesome,
 very


niche
 YouTube
 channel
 that
 talks
 about


how
 to
 start
 and
 operate
 pizza


businesses
 and
 they
 explain
 this
 very


problem
 as
 people
 who
 specialize
 in


pizza
 business.
 The
 thing
 is,
 pizza


delivery
 service
 as
 we
 know
 it
 works


fine.
 It's
 not
 ideal,
 but
 it's
 good


enough.
 And
 there
 isn't
 enough
 evidence


for
 a
 service
 gap
 that
 Zoom
 set
 out
 to


fix.
 Zoom's
 focus
 on
 technology
 over


basic
 product
 quality
 created
 an


unscalable
 business
 model.
 They
 went


into
 aggressive
 expansion
 without


validating
 their
 business
 model
 and


product
 in
 initial
 markets.
 I'm
 frankly


extremely
 surprised
 how
 this
 problem
 did


not
 come
 up
 in
 initial
 testing.
 But
 if


the
 initial
 testing
 never
 happened,
 then


that
 would
 answer
 my
 question.


And
 lastly,
 Quibby,
 the
 1.75
 billion


short
 form
 streaming
 disaster.
 Quibby


was
 a
 short
 form
 video
 streaming


platform
 in
 early
 2020s.
 They
 raised


approximately
 $1.75
 billion
 from


investors
 before
 launching
 in
 April
 2020


and
 shutting
 down
 in
 December
 2020.
 The


company
 was
 alive
 for
 6
 months.
 Quibby


is
 probably
 the
 fastest
 and
 the
 most


expensive
 content
 platform
 failure.
 And


the
 core
 theme
 here
 is
 that
 they
 failed


to
 understand
 how
 people
 consume
 mobile


content.
 This
 is
 definitely
 the
 fastest


failure
 given
 the
 funding
 of
 all
 the


companies
 that
 we
 covered
 today.
 Let's


understand
 why.
 Quibby
 raised
 funds


through
 multiple
 rounds
 and
 multiple


investors.
 They
 were
 backed
 by
 top
 tier


Hollywood
 studios.
 NBC,
 Sony,
 Warner


Brothers,
 Lionsgate,
 MGM,
 tech
 firms


like
 Alibaba,
 and
 investors
 like
 Goldman


Sachs
 and
 JP
 Morgan.
 The
 company
 spent


lavishly
 on
 content
 production.
 Budgets


reached
 up
 to
 $100,000
 per
 minute
 for


original
 scripted
 shows.
 They
 produced
 a


wide
 range
 of
 original
 short
 form


content
 with
 a
 heavy
 focus
 on
 high
 value


production
 and
 big
 Hollywood
 talent.


Given
 that
 they
 were
 on
 the
 market
 for


six
 months,
 they've
 got
 quite
 a
 few


shows
 under
 their
 belt.
 Quibby
 invested


heavily
 in
 content,
 announcing
 plans
 to


spend
 over
 $1.1
 billion
 on
 original


programming
 during
 its
 first
 year
 of


operation.
 prestigious
 filmmakers
 and


stars
 signed
 on,
 and
 many
 shows
 had


massive
 production
 budgets,
 very
 much


comparable
 to
 high-end
 cable
 TV
 and
 even


Netflix
 originals.
 Advertising
 spending


reached
 $63
 million
 in
 just
 6
 months
 of


operations.
 But
 despite
 all
 of
 that,


Quibby's
 revenue
 from
 subscriptions
 and


ads
 was
 $7
 million,
 and
 advertiser


payments
 started
 being
 deferred
 due
 to


low
 viewership.
 So,
 let's
 talk
 about


what
 went
 wrong.
 The
 biggest
 theme
 with


Quibby
 is
 that
 they
 really
 misunderstood


the
 market.
 Quibby's
 executives
 believe


that
 people
 wanted
 high
 quality
 short


form
 content
 for
 commuting,
 but
 they


launched
 in
 2020
 when
 commuting


disappeared.
 The
 service
 charged
 from
 $5


to
 7
 for
 content
 that
 users
 could
 get


free
 on
 Tik
 Tok
 or
 YouTube.
 Now,
 another


problem
 is
 the
 production
 costs.
 Despite


spending
 over
 $1
 billion
 on
 content
 from


Hollywood
 talent,
 Quibby
 failed
 to


produce
 any
 breakout
 hits.
 Now,
 as


someone
 who
 got
 into
 content
 creation


fairly
 recently,
 I
 genuinely
 think
 that


there
 is
 no
 point
 in
 making
 large


investments
 into
 production
 until
 you


start
 feeling
 the
 content
 market
 fit,
 so


to
 say.
 And
 to
 be
 clear,
 I'm
 not


comparing
 myself
 to
 a
 media
 company
 with


massive
 Hollywood
 investors.
 They're
 in


a
 polar
 opposite
 scale.
 But


nevertheless,
 this
 is
 a
 content
 business


and
 I
 treat
 my
 own
 channel
 from
 a


perspective
 of
 a
 product
 manager.
 This


is
 my
 product.
 The
 point
 where
 we
 knew


that
 it
 makes
 sense
 for
 us
 to
 start


investing
 in
 better
 visuals
 was
 when
 we


hit
 several
 consecutive
 breakout
 videos.


When
 our
 channel
 had
 500
 subscribers


back
 in
 April,
 our
 video
 started


reaching
 50
 to
 80,000
 views,
 which
 was
 a


massive
 number
 for
 our
 channel
 size
 at


the
 time
 and
 given
 our
 subscriber
 count.


and
 we
 hit
 those
 views
 when
 videos
 were


filmed
 on
 my
 iPhone
 13
 with
 one
 $80


softbox.
 I
 deliberately
 kept
 everything


extremely
 low
 budget
 because
 I
 wanted
 to


see
 if
 my
 content
 could
 get
 breakout


through
 the
 value
 of
 the
 research
 and


the
 content
 that
 I
 produce.
 So,


investing
 billions
 in
 production
 when


you
 have
 absolutely
 no
 idea
 whether
 your


content
 is
 going
 to
 be
 watched
 makes
 no


sense.
 They
 also
 had
 a
 lot
 of
 technical


limitations.
 The
 app's
 inability
 to


share
 content
 on
 social
 media
 prevented


organic
 growth
 and
 word
 of
 mouth


marketing.
 And
 that
 is
 the
 bread
 and


butter
 of
 modern
 content
 platforms.


Users
 could
 not
 take
 screenshots.
 They


could
 not
 create
 clips.
 They
 could
 not


share
 anything
 with
 friends.
 End
 result,


within
 6
 months
 since
 inception,
 Quibby


announced
 it
 shut
 down.
 They
 admitted
 to


have
 failed
 to
 achieve
 sustainable


subscriber
 numbers
 for
 profitability.


The
 company
 returned
 some
 remaining


investor
 funds
 as
 goodwill
 and
 laid
 off


nearly
 250
 employees.
 Roku
 acquired


Quibby's
 content
 library
 in
 early
 2021


for
 hund00
 million
 and
 rebranded
 it
 as


Roku
 Originals.


Building
 a
 scalable
 AI
 business
 is
 very


hard.
 It's
 just
 as
 hard
 for
 larger
 corps


as
 it
 is
 for
 startups.
 The
 difference
 is


in
 the
 scale,
 but
 it's
 equally
 as
 hard.


Don't
 overestimate
 the
 model
 and


underestimate
 basic
 product
 quality.


Price
 the
 invisible
 labor.
 Account
 for


basic
 physics.
 Test
 before
 you
 invest


and
 benchmark
 against
 the
 boring
 product


management
 metrics
 that
 always
 work.


Ship
 the
 smallest
 thing
 that
 pays
 for


itself
 and
 let
 AI
 amplify
 an
 already


solid
 product.
 If
 the
 unit
 economics


don't
 beat
 the
 baseline,
 it's
 not
 a


pivot
 and
 it's
 not
 a
 business.
 You're


building
 a
 demo
 and
 demo
 doesn't
 pay
 the


bills.

 this
 video

 helpful,
 let
 us

 what

Till
 next
 time.
 Bye.
