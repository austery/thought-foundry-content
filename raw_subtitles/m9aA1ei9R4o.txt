Hey
 there,
 OddLotss
 listeners.
 You
 are


about
 to
 hear
 a
 very
 special
 episode
 of


the
 podcast.
 This
 was
 recorded
 live
 at


our
 June
 26th
 event
 in
 New
 York.
 We
 are


talking
 with
 Charlie
 McGeligette.
 He
 is


of
 course
 managing
 director
 and


crossasset
 macro
 strategist
 for
 the


global
 markets
 America's
 business
 over


at
 Numora.
 We
 talked
 to
 him
 about


volatility
 in
 the
 market.
 What
 else?


Yep.
 It's
 been
 a
 kind
 of
 extraordinary


couple
 of
 months
 with
 stocks
 basically


at
 all-time
 highs
 despite
 so
 much
 going


on
 in
 the
 world.
 What
 actually
 explains


what's
 happening?
 Charlie
 uh
 does
 a


pretty
 good
 job.
 So,
 take
 a
 listen.


Thank
 you
 so
 much,
 Charlie,
 for
 being


here.
 Awesome
 to
 be
 here.
 Awesome
 to
 see


you
 guys.
 So,
 I
 didn't
 actually
 see


where
 the
 market
 closed
 today,
 but
 like


we're
 pretty
 close.
 Like
 either
 we're
 at


record
 highs
 or
 we're
 very
 close
 to
 it.


I
 didn't
 actually
 see.
 But
 it's
 crazy
 to


me
 all
 that's
 happened
 in
 2025


and
 like
 we're
 sitting
 here
 at
 alltime


highs.
 It's
 not
 intuitive.
 You
 have
 to


admit
 it's
 kind
 of
 weird.
 the
 um
 you


know
 I
 think
 the
 message
 I'm
 trying
 to


remember
 the
 last
 time
 I
 was
 with
 you


guys
 but
 probably
 the
 message
 I
 was


communicating
 at
 that
 time
 was
 the
 the


fixation
 and
 kind
 of
 the
 dooming


with
 the
 left
 tail
 scenarios
 and
 um
 as


so
 often
 is
 the
 case
 when
 people
 are
 not


incentivized
 to
 see
 the
 world
 burn
 which


might
 be
 debatable
 to
 some
 um
 but
 and


you
 start
 seeing
 especially
 with
 regard


to
 you
 know
 negotiating
 tactics
 and


things
 like
 that
 where
 you
 start
 getting


that
 not
 quite
 as
 bad
 as
 feared


scenario.
 oftent
 times
 there's
 an
 impact


certainly
 with
 the
 mechanical
 stuff
 that


we
 so
 often
 talk
 about
 and
 you
 really


underpric
 the
 less
 bad
 outcome
 and


there's
 a
 mechanical
 impact
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 you
 know
 v
 distribution
 stuff
 and


it
 creates
 second
 order
 impact
 second


order
 flows
 I
 think
 the
 most
 fascinating


two
 points
 that
 I
 would
 say
 outside
 of


the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 mechanical
 flows


that
 we
 talk
 about
 and
 and
 the


volatility
 component
 of
 this
 is
 is
 is


two
 things
 I
 I
 think
 back
 to
 2022


um
 where
 we
 had
 our
 first
 kind
 of


inflationdriven
 macrobear
 case,
 right?


We
 just
 started
 the
 tightening
 cycle.
 I


think
 there
 was
 nine
 or
 10
 months
 in
 a


row
 of
 inflation
 upside
 surprises
 with


CPI
 and
 um
 you
 know
 the
 macro
 bear
 case


for
 equities
 at
 that
 point
 was
 this


earnings
 recession
 where
 due
 to
 this


price
 shock
 it
 was
 going
 to
 impact


consumption
 topline
 sales
 go
 lower
 and


you
 know
 so
 so
 on
 and
 so
 forth.
 What


ended
 up
 happening
 is
 ironically
 because


of
 the
 health
 of
 the
 consumer
 and
 tight


tight
 tight
 employment
 with
 wages
 at


40-year
 highs,
 you
 ended
 up
 actually


getting
 a
 dynamic
 where
 the
 corporate


world
 operates
 on
 aggregate
 consumption.


They
 they
 operate
 in
 a
 nominal
 GDP
 world


and
 that
 inflation
 perversely
 for
 the


bears
 was
 the
 earnings
 catalyst
 and
 all


those
 folks
 got
 stopped
 out
 in
 2023.


there
 is
 an
 element
 of
 that
 still
 to


this
 day
 right
 now
 as
 it
 relates
 to


earnings.
 Um
 even
 be
 even
 though
 like


nominal
 GDP
 is
 is
 in
 a
 different
 place


to
 a
 certain
 extent
 still
 kind
 of
 5%ish.


Um
 but
 the
 other
 point
 too
 is
 that
 as
 it


relates
 to
 the
 capex
 spending


uncertainty
 story,
 right?
 If
 you
 know


corporates
 don't
 know
 what
 they're


supposed
 to
 do
 with
 their
 cash
 because


of
 the
 you
 know
 the
 the
 kind
 of
 range
 of


outcomes
 with
 regards
 to
 you
 know
 where


they
 where
 these
 you
 know
 uh
 tariffs
 are


going
 to
 end
 up
 um
 the
 sand
 in
 the
 gears


of
 the
 global
 economy.
 Well,
 the
 thought


was
 of
 course,
 you
 know,
 if
 corporates


don't
 know
 what
 to
 be
 spending
 on
 and
 um


consumers
 are
 feeling
 that
 impact
 as


well,
 you're
 going
 to
 get
 this
 eventual


drag
 with
 regards
 to
 consumption.
 You're


going to
 have
 corporates
 in
 a
 bad
 place.


You
 either
 lose
 the
 topline
 sales


because
 consumers
 are
 paying
 through
 the


roof
 or
 you
 have
 to
 absorb
 those
 costs


and
 your
 margins
 go
 lower.
 Um
 but
 what


corporates
 have
 instead
 done
 have
 taken


authorized
 buybacks
 to
 all-time
 highs.


So
 we're
 not
 spending
 on,
 you
 know,
 R&D.


We're
 not
 spending
 on
 hiring
 or
 building


that
 new
 plant.
 We're
 going
 to
 buy
 back


more
 stock
 than
 ever
 before
 year
 to


date.
 And
 that,
 you
 know,
 if
 you
 look
 at


corporate
 buyback
 flows
 as
 a
 source
 of


demand
 for
 equities
 over
 the
 past
 1015


year
 period,
 it's
 a
 magnitudes
 six,


seven,
 eight
 times
 magnitudes
 largest


source
 of
 demand.
 So
 you've
 had
 these


two
 kind
 of
 unintuitive
 dynamics
 in
 the


market
 that
 have
 actually
 kept
 us
 higher


on
 top
 of
 all
 those
 kind
 of
 V
 scaling


things
 that
 we
 like
 to
 talk
 about.
 Wait.


So
 the
 other
 thing
 that's
 happened
 is


people
 are
 back
 to
 actually
 selling
 V.


So
 basically
 betting
 that
 you
 know


things
 will
 stay
 relatively
 calm.
 Why
 is


that
 happening?
 It
 seems
 like
 a
 weird


time
 to
 bet
 against
 volatility.
 Yeah.
 I


I
 think
 I
 think
 selling
 V
 uh
 has
 become


a
 new
 form
 of
 fixed
 income
 in
 a
 world


where
 bonds
 are
 no
 longer
 a
 risk-free


asset.
 Now
 that
 you
 know
 can
 go
 wrong
 so


many
 ways.
 In
 this
 case
 the


proliferation
 of
 like
 premium
 income


overwriting
 strategies
 within
 the
 ETF


world,
 exotic
 structured
 products
 um
 and


kind
 of
 you
 know
 more
 uh
 I
 would
 say
 you


know
 complicated
 you
 know
 V
 selling


strategies
 like
 uh
 dispersion
 things


like
 that.
 The
 number
 of
 V
 suppliers
 out


there
 very
 shortdated.
 It
 gets
 dealers


stuffed
 on
 gamma,
 I
 always
 like
 to
 say.


And
 in
 that
 sense,
 you
 know,


particularly
 with
 the
 amount
 of


shortdated
 volatility
 selling,
 um,
 you


know,
 when
 dealers
 are
 stuffed
 on
 gamma,


it
 compresses
 the
 distribution
 of


outcomes,
 right?
 If
 the
 market's
 moving


higher,
 you're
 selling
 into
 that


market's
 moving
 lower,
 you're
 shock


absorbing.
 Um,
 the
 thing
 that
 I
 would


say
 back
 to
 that
 point
 about,
 you
 know,


selling
 volatility
 as
 some
 sort
 of
 kind


of
 fixed
 income
 product.
 back
 in
 2022


with
 that
 tightening
 cycle
 and
 all
 the


the
 the
 bare
 dooming
 um
 with
 regards
 to


you
 know
 we're
 going
 to
 break
 something


um
 you
 know
 such
 a
 such
 a
 powerful
 you


know
 ultimately
 over
 500
 basis
 points
 of


t
 of
 hikes.
 Um
 the
 the
 trick
 was
 that


okay
 you
 the
 Fed
 is
 telling
 you
 to
 be


short
 assets.
 Mhm.
 You
 need
 to
 be
 able


to
 sleep
 at
 night.
 Cash
 was
 an
 asset


again.
 So,
 you
 know,
 market
 was
 down
 30


some
 percent.
 Bonds
 were
 down


simultaneously.


Still
 off
 that
 much.
 Yeah.
 S&P
 and


NASDAQ
 was
 you
 know,
 you
 know,
 even


bigger
 than
 that
 obviously
 because


remember
 it
 was
 like
 this
 tech
 ccentric


growth
 kind
 of
 unwind.
 Um
 but
 what
 ended


up
 happening
 was
 that
 you
 know
 the
 Fed


was
 trying
 to
 create
 a
 negative
 wealth


effect.
 We've
 talked
 about
 that
 before


because
 they
 couldn't
 impact
 supply
 side


disruption.
 They
 could
 only
 impact


demand
 side.
 And
 by
 telling
 you
 to
 be
 in


cash,
 you
 could
 sleep
 at
 night.
 Well,


guess
 what?
 the
 next
 year
 you
 missed
 a


50%
 rally
 in
 the
 NASDAQ.
 So
 what
 really


smart
 marketers
 have
 done
 is
 say
 well


I'm
 going
 to
 give
 you
 price
 appreciation


of
 equities
 just
 capped
 and
 off
 the
 back


of
 that
 too
 we're
 going
 to
 sell
 out
 of


the
 money
 calls
 against
 this
 and
 you
 get


this
 like
 little
 premium
 income
 thing


and
 it's
 you
 know
 they're
 never
 telling


you
 you're
 shorting
 options.
 The
 good


news
 is
 with
 a
 lot
 of these
 products


nowadays,
 like
 you're
 not
 shorting


crash.
 You're
 not
 shorting
 downside.
 But


um
 also
 too,
 sometimes
 they're
 they're


contributing
 to
 their
 own
 demise
 in
 this


kind
 of
 grinding
 market
 where
 you're


stopping
 into
 the
 calls
 that
 you've
 been


selling.
 There's
 so
 much
 going
 on.
 I


totally
 forgot
 that
 we
 had
 such
 a
 big


sell-off
 in
 2022.
 I
 totally
 forgot
 that


there
 was
 like
 a
 50%
 like
 all
 of
 these


things
 like
 oh
 that
 actually
 happened.


Um
 zooming
 out
 big
 picture
 like
 it
 seems


objectively
 true.
 you've
 been
 trading
 a


long
 time.
 Like
 there
 are
 so
 many


headlines
 these
 days
 and
 they're
 always


changing
 and
 there's
 just
 so
 much
 to


talk
 about.
 What
 is
 the
 trading
 like
 and


how
 do
 you
 know
 does
 it
 feel
 different


these
 days
 when
 there's
 just
 we're
 just


facing
 this
 constant
 wall
 of
 news?
 Is


there
 something
 that
 changes
 in
 the
 sort


of
 complexion
 of
 how
 people
 trade?
 Well,


there's
 there's
 certainly
 different
 like


risk
 appetite
 regimes,
 risk
 sentiment


regimes,
 you
 know,
 where
 um
 you
 know,


there
 was
 a
 period
 of
 time
 I
 remember
 in


those
 early
 discussions
 on
 like
 zero
 DT


options
 where
 generally
 speaking
 at
 that


time
 coming
 off
 the
 back
 of
 like
 you


know,
 meme
 coins
 and
 and
 that
 whole
 like


yolo
 phenomenon,
 you
 know,
 the


speculative
 excess
 peak
 of
 that
 kind
 of


2021,
 you
 know,
 sty
 driven
 madness,
 that


was
 a
 very
 different
 world
 where
 people


were
 kind
 of
 like,
 you
 buying,
 you
 know,


optionality,
 creating
 gamma
 squeezes,


the
 redder
 boards,
 Wall
 Street
 bats,
 all


that
 jazz.
 Now
 that
 you're
 kind
 of


settling
 into
 this
 world,
 we've
 been


conditioned,
 we've
 been
 conditioned
 for


15
 years
 of
 moral
 hazard,
 right?
 Central


bankers
 intervening,
 obviously


politicians
 now
 intervening,
 and
 this
 is


like,
 you
 know,
 party
 agnostic
 with


regards
 to
 the
 fiscal
 stimulus
 where
 it


has
 become
 conditioned
 into
 traders
 both


retail
 and
 institutional.
 You
 know,
 this


dynamic
 where
 you
 have
 to
 this
 is
 the


expected
 behavior.
 you
 have
 to
 buy
 that


dip
 and
 sell
 it,
 right?
 So,
 you're


constantly
 trying
 to
 like
 kind
 of


triangulate
 and
 kind
 of
 sanity
 check


yourself
 with
 regards
 to
 this


reflexivity.
 And
 you
 know,
 like
 August


5th,
 August
 2nd,
 August
 5th
 last
 year


were
 really
 interesting
 experiment
 cuz


August
 2nd,
 we
 finally
 got
 that
 first


glimpse
 at
 what
 our
 market
 will


eventually
 do.
 This
 time
 again,
 huge
 VAR


event
 in,
 you
 know,
 within
 the
 fixed


income
 space
 certainly.
 Um,
 and
 then
 it


trickled
 down
 into
 all
 asset
 classes


from
 there.
 It
 was
 the
 first
 time
 that


labor,
 it
 looked
 like
 labor
 was


cracking.
 Um,
 and
 we
 had
 that,
 you
 know,


four
 zcore
 miss
 and
 the
 U
 rate
 and
 two


and a
 half
 zcore
 miss
 and
 and
 the


non-farm
 payroll
 print
 and
 that
 was


after
 a
 week
 of
 already
 soft
 labor
 data.


And
 that
 was
 the
 holy
 moment
 once
 the


consumer
 goes
 this
 whole,
 you
 know,


economic
 miracle
 goes.
 And
 what
 that


then
 created
 was
 this
 um,
 you
 know,
 was


this
 massive
 dynamic
 where
 at
 the
 end
 of


that
 day,
 everybody
 said,
 "Okay,
 risk
 is


dicey
 right
 now.
 There's
 going
 to
 be
 a


lot
 of
 the
 leveraging
 off
 the
 back
 of


this
 realized
 volatility
 shock.
 I
 want


to
 go
 home
 and
 short
 Delta,
 like
 short


the
 market,
 but
 I
 want
 to
 be
 short
 V


because
 V
 squeezed.
 V
 exploded
 that
 day.


That
 was
 both
 clients
 and
 options


dealers.
 The
 problem
 was
 because
 of
 all


these
 second
 order
 impacts
 and


deleveraging
 impacts
 and
 um
 was
 that


Nikke
 on
 Sunday
 night
 opened
 down
 12%.


So
 that
 short
 V
 position
 was
 going
 to
 be


so
 smart
 because
 we
 always
 reflexively


sell
 that,
 you
 know,
 and
 you've
 got
 to


monetize
 your
 hedges
 in
 like
 two
 hours


before
 people
 start
 leaning
 in.
 All
 that


V
 supply,
 the
 back
 test
 says
 the
 higher


V
 goes,
 the
 more
 I
 have
 to
 sell.
 And


that's
 that
 sell
 the
 rip
 by
 the
 by
 the


dip.
 Well,
 those
 people
 got
 their
 arms


blown
 off,
 you
 know,
 by
 8
 in
 the


morning.
 And
 that
 was
 the
 famous
 like


VIX
 index,
 right,
 which
 is
 a
 a


theoretical
 calculation
 based
 on
 like


fake
 bidden
 offers
 from
 dealers


basically.
 Um,
 you
 know,
 printed
 63
 or


whatever
 it
 was.
 Um,
 not
 an
 actual


ticking
 price,
 but
 then
 the
 VIX
 future


was
 traded
 at
 38,
 which
 is
 like


realistic.
 But,
 you
 know,
 those
 are


those
 scenarios
 where
 that
 conditioning


is
 how
 things
 go
 really
 wrong
 because


you
 think
 you
 got
 it
 figured
 out
 and
 you


don't.
 The
 most
 recent
 example
 of
 course


has
 been
 you
 know
 this
 this
 Trump
 collar


dynamic
 where
 the
 market
 finally
 figured


out
 what
 was
 the
 human
 vivix
 as
 I
 call


him
 you
 know
 who
 who
 you
 know
 the


volatility
 the
 only
 one
 who
 calls
 it


you're
 the
 only
 one
 I
 need
 it
 on
 my


coffee
 mug
 you
 know
 I
 have
 these
 like


Nura
 coffee
 mugs
 with
 some
 of
 my


favorite
 sayings
 like
 human
 vivix
 would


have
 been
 a
 good
 one
 to
 trademark
 we'll


trade
 you
 an
 oddls
 mug
 for
 a
 human
 vivix


no
 more
 mug
 that's
 done
 that
 is
 done
 but


like
 you
 know
 he
 has
 he
 views
 himself
 as


having
 a
 mandate
 to
 disrupt
 the
 status


quo
 of
 80
 years
 of
 pox
 americana
 like


and
 that's
 clearly
 like
 the
 the
 approach


here
 right
 so
 the
 prior
 distribution
 of


outcomes
 is
 now
 out
 here
 the
 the
 quick


learning
 from
 the
 market
 however
 after


these
 initial
 series
 of
 wall
 shocks
 was


that
 okay
 we
 found
 a
 pain
 point
 you
 know


market
 sold
 off
 to
 such
 an
 extent
 the


interest
 rate
 volatility
 particularly
 in


the
 long
 end
 not
 just
 stocks
 all
 right


you
 know
 we've
 activated
 the
 Trump
 put


however
 upon
 those
 compromises
 the


market
 rallies
 back
 it
 increases
 his
 you


know
 willingness
 to
 then
 lean
 back
 in


from
 a
 negotiating
 ploy.
 So
 he's


basically
 selling
 the
 call
 to
 fund
 the


put.
 And
 when
 you
 have
 that
 collaring


effect,
 you
 get
 the
 opposite
 dynamic,


right?
 You
 get
 this
 realize
 of
 all


compression,
 which
 is
 frankly
 a
 large


part
 of
 what
 the
 past
 2
 months
 has
 been.


So,
 you're
 constantly
 reassessing


how
 everybody
 thinks
 you're
 going
 to


think,
 which
 is
 like
 you're
 anticipating


the
 anticipators.


[Music]


So
 Joe
 asked
 you
 for
 basically
 color
 on


the
 complexion
 of
 the
 market
 nowadays


and
 I
 know
 you
 just
 got
 back
 from


weren't
 you
 on
 some
 sort
 of
 crazy
 epic


travel
 schedule
 where
 you
 flew
 around


the
 world.
 Yes.
 What
 are
 you
 hearing


from
 clients
 like
 what
 kind
 of
 questions


are
 they
 asking
 you?
 People
 are
 so


consensually
 macrobear


you
 know
 on
 that
 stagflationary
 outcome.


Um,
 you
 know,
 and
 I
 think
 like
 that's


that's
 one
 of the
 tricks
 like
 it's,
 you


know,
 at
 first
 it
 was
 like,
 okay,
 you


know,
 let's
 let's
 expect,
 you
 know,


these
 early
 return
 like
 mind
 you,
 you


know,
 Smoot
 Holly
 tariff
 highs
 like


90-year
 tariff
 highs,
 right?
 We,
 you


know,
 prior
 to
 the
 the,
 you
 know,
 Trump


2.0,
 the
 effective
 rate
 was
 2.4%.
 We're


17.3%
 right
 now
 as
 it
 stands,
 right?
 So,


like,
 you
 know,
 how
 does
 that
 not
 bleed


through
 to
 this,
 you
 know,
 eventual


price
 shock
 or
 margin
 compression,
 all


this
 stuff
 that
 hits,
 you
 know,


consumption?
 Um,
 and
 you
 know,
 initially


it
 was
 okay
 midsummer.
 I
 think
 part
 of


what's
 happening
 right
 now
 is
 that,
 you


know,
 from
 a
 corporate
 perspective
 as
 it


relates
 to
 the
 consumer
 is
 that
 taco
 has


changed
 their
 behavior
 too.
 Like
 why,


you
 know,
 I'm
 not
 going
 to
 blow
 up
 my


topline
 sales
 and,
 you
 know,
 rush
 to,


you
 know,
 price
 shock
 my
 clients
 at
 a


time,
 you
 know.
 So
 I
 think
 there's
 been


a
 lot
 of
 holding
 off
 too
 as
 far
 as
 or


willingness
 to
 even
 absorb
 a
 little
 bit


of
 that
 the
 the
 price
 you
 know
 increases


that
 are
 coming
 through.
 Um
 and
 you
 know


so
 it's
 been
 getting
 increasingly


uncomfortable.
 All
 these
 left
 tail
 most


acute
 outcomes
 have
 have
 certainly
 been


mitigated
 away
 and
 compromised
 away
 and


kind
 of
 handed
 away.
 The
 market
 starts


rallying
 in
 your
 face.
 You're
 expecting


this
 very
 bearish
 outcome.
 It's
 starting


to
 hurt.
 You've
 underpriced
 the
 right


tail.
 get
 a
 fiscal
 deal
 seemingly
 close


to
 being
 done
 even
 just
 today,
 right?


Late
 in
 the
 day,
 section
 8.99,
 which
 is


this
 kind
 of
 like,
 you
 know,
 completely


Tracy
 wrote
 a
 bunch
 about
 it.
 Now,
 it's


all
 the
 revenge
 tax,
 right?
 Is
 there


anything
 worse
 than
 like
 getting
 a
 bunch


of
 work
 done
 and
 then
 having
 to
 trash


it?
 All
 I'll
 say
 is
 it's
 good
 for


content.
 Yes.
 There
 we
 go.
 Yes,
 it
 is.


You
 talk
 a
 lot
 a
 lot
 about
 hypotheticals


over
 the
 past
 couple
 months.
 For
 sure.


Yeah.
 you
 know,
 you're
 you're
 well


educated
 with
 your
 scenarios,
 but
 like


in
 this
 case,
 you
 know,
 that
 was


another,
 you
 know,
 this
 revenge
 tax


escalation.
 Well,
 all
 of
 a
 sudden
 now,


you
 know,
 cooler
 heads
 prevail
 that


increases
 the
 likelihood
 that
 the


digital
 tax,
 you
 know,
 stuff
 with
 Europe


that
 was
 an
 impediment
 for
 deals
 goes,


you
 know,
 right
 way.
 So,
 you've
 just
 had


like
 left
 tails
 turn
 right
 tails
 and


nobody
 has
 the
 exposure
 on.
 There's
 just


so
 much
 chronic
 macro
 bleed.
 Now,


perversely,
 you're
 seeing
 it
 with


stocks.
 People
 are
 getting
 stopped
 in.


You're
 buying
 the
 highs.
 you're
 having


to
 take
 up
 your
 exposure,
 having
 to
 take


up
 your
 nets
 after
 fighting
 it,
 kicking


and
 screaming
 and
 grossly
 under


capturing
 the
 rally.
 This
 is
 when
 it


sets
 the
 table
 for
 crash.
 And
 that's
 why


as
 you're
 forced
 to
 get
 longer,
 you
 have


to
 start
 hedge.
 You
 have
 to
 start


hedging.
 Do
 you
 think
 right
 now
 I
 mean
 I


remember
 um
 well
 like
 right
 now
 today


would
 you
 say
 there's
 still
 a
 lot


there's
 a
 lot
 of
 discretionary
 money


where
 people
 feel
 like
 they're
 underway


at
 the
 market
 where
 they
 feel
 like


they're
 still
 fighting
 this
 dynamic


chasing
 and
 they're
 still
 feel
 like
 oh


man
 every
 day
 the
 stock
 market
 goes
 up
 I


don't
 have
 the
 exposure
 I
 wish
 I
 had


right
 now
 those
 are
 the
 classic
 buyers


are
 higher
 yeah
 you
 know
 and
 there


that's
 still
 out
 there
 but
 they
 haven't


the
 they
 haven't
 fully
 capitulated
 yet


but
 It's,
 you
 know,
 what
 you're
 seeing


with
 the
 market
 grinding
 higher
 every


day.
 And
 by
 the
 way,
 through
 the


straddle,
 like
 this
 is
 the
 interesting


thing
 I
 always
 say
 like
 we
 can't
 crash


until
 skew
 is
 steep.
 Skew
 is
 a
 relative


measure
 of
 kind
 of
 downside
 demand


versus
 upside
 demand.
 You
 know,
 put


skew,
 you
 know,
 demand
 for
 out
 of
 the


money
 downside
 versus
 out
 of the
 money


downside.
 Both
 of
 those
 me
 metrics
 in


the
 past
 week
 have
 hit
 100
 percentile


over
 the
 past
 year.
 The
 past
 year
 has
 a


lot
 of
 going
 on,
 right?
 So,
 you
 know,


people
 are
 hedged
 because
 they
 are
 back


getting
 long
 where
 things
 get
 spicy.
 And


when
 you're
 hedged,
 that
 means
 dealers


are,
 you
 know,
 short
 downside.
 They're


going
 to
 be
 short
 gamma,
 short
 Vega
 into


a
 sell-off.
 That's
 accelerant
 flow.
 Um,


that
 feeds
 into
 the
 prevailing
 market


momentum.
 The
 lower
 that
 we
 go,
 the


more,
 you
 know,
 spot
 equities
 you
 have


to
 sell.
 The
 higher
 the
 V
 goes,
 the
 more


volume
 you
 have
 to
 buy.
 Bad
 scenario.


It's
 an
 accelerant
 flow
 in
 this
 case.
 Um


the
 trick
 now
 that's
 starting
 to
 happen


and
 this
 is
 why
 I
 feel
 like
 we're


probably
 getting
 closer
 to
 you
 know
 a


crescendo
 um
 is
 that
 now
 you're
 getting


spot
 the
 market
 up
 vault
 up
 and
 volivall


going
 up
 and
 what
 that's
 telling
 me
 is


that
 okay
 people
 are
 actually
 now
 being


forced
 to
 chase
 into
 upside
 right
 and


right
 now
 part
 that's
 our
 chart
 for
 the


newsletter
 tomorrow
 stocks
 and
 vol
 spot


up
 vol
 and
 and
 what
 that
 means
 is
 that


people
 are
 being
 forced
 to
 grab
 into
 the


upside
 side
 and
 that's
 also
 feeding
 this


short
 gamma
 move
 to
 the
 upside
 because


dealers
 are
 short
 calls
 now
 and
 this
 you


know
 as
 we
 hit
 6150
 6200
 things
 like


that.
 Um,
 ultimately
 I
 always
 like
 to


say
 when
 you
 get
 spot
 up
 volop
 in
 and
 of


itself,
 it
 it,
 you
 know,
 creates
 kind
 of


like
 a
 meltup
 like
 some
 sort
 of
 kind
 of,


you
 know,
 squeezy
 rally
 on
 the
 way
 up


that
 collapses
 under
 the
 weight
 of
 its


own
 delta.
 Like
 collapses
 under
 the


weight
 of
 the
 mechanical
 buying
 on
 the


way
 up,
 the
 mechanical
 dealer
 hedging
 on


the
 way
 up
 because
 you
 need
 to
 keep


fulfilling
 that
 need
 and
 demand.
 People


are
 getting
 longer.
 You
 know,
 you're


finally
 seeing
 that
 dynamic.
 People
 are


getting
 longer.
 that
 creates
 the
 the


potential
 derisking
 flow
 on
 the
 way


down,
 especially
 once
 you're
 talking


about
 systematic
 V
 scaling
 strategies


that
 as
 V
 goes
 higher,
 they
 have
 to
 just


sell,
 you
 know,
 unemotionally.
 But
 what


would
 be
 a
 reasonable
 catalyst
 for
 that


to
 happen?
 Well,
 I
 think
 the
 the


near-term
 one
 has
 been,
 you
 know,
 the


the
 fact
 that,
 you
 know,
 July
 8th,
 the


original
 kind
 of
 reciprocal
 delay
 that,


you
 know,
 and
 you
 saw
 a
 bunch
 of


headlines
 today
 saying
 like
 that's


flexible,
 morally
 flexible.
 Um,
 you


know,
 I
 think
 that
 big
 surprise.
 Yeah.


No,
 no,
 let's
 make
 a
 deal.
 I
 I
 would
 say


that
 that
 right
 now
 that's
 kind
 of
 like


the
 most
 obvious
 um
 you
 know
 one
 out


there
 that
 you
 know
 there's
 still
 some


element
 of
 of
 hard
 ball.
 My
 view
 is
 that


that's
 somewhat
 overstated
 that
 that
 is


somewhat
 overstated
 because
 he
 needs
 to


get
 one
 big
 beautiful
 bill
 passed
 first


before
 that
 and
 then
 potentially
 you
 can


play
 the
 game.
 But
 the
 fact
 that
 this


899
 was
 removed
 tells
 me
 that
 they
 know


that
 getting
 a
 deal
 with
 Europe
 is


probably,
 you
 know,
 a
 larger,
 you
 know,


u
 impediment
 to
 what
 they're
 trying
 to


do.
 And
 that
 there
 still
 is
 now
 this
 new


conditioning
 in
 the
 market
 where
 instead


of
 like
 increasing
 the
 rhetoric
 at
 the


highs,
 you
 know,
 Trump
 has
 capitulated


back
 into
 Trump
 1.0,
 which
 is
 like,
 you


know,
 run
 hot,
 right?
 He's
 now
 and
 they


are
 best
 in
 himself
 with
 the
 headlines


out
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 day.
 They're


they're
 trying
 to
 squeeze
 this
 thing


higher
 and
 financial
 conditions
 are


easing.
 The
 dollar
 is
 moving
 lower.
 Long


and
 yield
 has
 started
 rallying


ironically
 because
 the
 market
 is


sniffing,
 you
 know,
 a
 dovish
 turn
 within


the
 Fed,
 you
 know,
 in
 including
 recent


comments
 from
 people
 that
 I
 don't
 think


would
 have
 anticipated
 um
 necessarily


outside
 of
 Waller
 um
 who's
 auditioning


for
 the
 Fed
 job.
 Um
 and
 you
 know,
 why


are
 they
 beginning
 to
 turn
 like
 that?


Yes,
 there's
 a
 normalization
 dynamic


with
 regards
 to
 where
 inflation
 is
 now.


We
 think
 Jerome
 Pal
 is
 already
 at
 two


dots
 are
 right,
 you
 know,
 for
 the
 end
 of


the
 year.
 And
 there's
 just
 this
 modest


turn,
 but
 they're
 turning
 for
 a
 reason.


They're
 turning
 cuz,
 you
 know,
 quits


rates
 and
 claims,
 you
 know,
 are
 starting


to
 get
 a
 little
 wonky.
 And
 as
 I
 said,


the
 whole
 American
 economic
 miracle
 goes


wrong
 when
 the
 consumer
 cracks.
 And
 the


consumer
 cracks
 is
 what,
 you
 know,


becomes
 of,
 you
 know,
 the
 labor
 market.


and
 that's
 starting
 to
 look
 um
 you
 know


precarious
 at
 best.
 So
 I
 think
 I
 don't


think
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 tariff
 headline


necessarily.
 I
 think
 it's
 going
 to
 be


you
 know
 good
 oldfashioned
 data
 a
 nasty


NFP
 print
 you
 know
 that
 type
 of
 a
 thing.


Um
 is
 that
 an
 acute
 risk
 now?
 Probably


not.
 Probably
 you
 know
 safe
 to
 say
 you


know
 within
 by
 August
 um
 you
 know
 we


could
 be
 getting
 spicy
 and
 I
 think


there's
 real
 delta
 not
 just
 of
 like
 the


first
 cut
 in
 September
 but
 you
 know
 if


that
 happens
 you
 know
 it's
 not
 just


going
 to
 be
 you
 know
 25
 bips
 right.
 So


everyone
 needs
 to
 keep
 shopping,
 I


guess,
 to
 maintain
 the
 rally.
 Do
 your


duty.
 So
 the
 thing
 is
 though,
 this
 is


what
 bothers
 me
 is
 everyone
 sees
 some
 of


these
 dynamics.
 We
 talk
 about
 the
 labor


market
 weakness
 all
 the
 time.
 We
 talk


about
 the
 fact
 that
 per
 due
 to
 the


tariffs
 and
 other
 factors,
 the
 Fed
 might


be
 a
 little
 bit
 gunshy
 or
 less
 inclined


to
 cut
 like
 than
 it
 otherwise
 would
 have


given
 the
 set
 of
 economic
 conditions.


And
 I
 think
 like
 Paul
 has
 sort
 of
 hinted


at
 it
 before
 that
 there
 are
 conditions


like
 we
 all
 can
 see
 this
 like
 the
 and


yet
 like
 and
 yet
 people
 keep
 buying
 like


it's
 sort
 of
 there's
 something


intellectually
 unsatisfying
 about
 the


entire
 environment.
 Well,
 cuz
 like
 all


this
 seems
 very
 true
 that
 all
 this
 like


the
 stagflation
 risk
 there
 is
 going
 to


be
 a
 cost
 of
 tariffs.
 There
 is
 this


cyclical
 slowdown
 and
 yet
 you
 know
 it


goes
 back
 to
 those
 you
 know
 kind
 of


counterintuitive
 observations
 that
 we


started
 off
 with
 you
 know
 where
 you
 get


so
 fixated
 on
 like
 the
 left
 side
 that


you
 know
 perversely
 the
 corporate


spending
 uncertainty
 becomes
 the
 biggest


source
 of
 demand
 for
 stocks.
 Yeah.
 you


know,
 um,
 and
 especially
 to
 the
 market


structure
 stuff,
 which
 is
 just
 what
 I


always
 come
 back
 to,
 like
 once
 those


puts
 start
 roasting
 because
 the
 worst


case
 scenario
 doesn't
 happen
 and
 dealers


got
 to
 start
 buying
 back
 that
 short


delta
 and
 then
 people
 start
 squeezing


that
 short
 delta
 as
 the
 market
 starts


rallying
 back
 and
 start
 buying
 short


dated
 calls
 and
 dealers
 get
 short
 those


calls
 and
 we
 go
 short
 gamma
 the
 other


way.
 you
 know
 th
 those
 flows
 and
 you


know
 frankly
 you
 know
 a
 world
 of
 um
 you


know
 not
 just
 this
 market
 structure
 that


feeds
 momentum
 right
 with
 leveraged
 ETFs


um
 you
 know
 the
 prevalence
 of
 options


trading
 the
 tail
 wagging
 the
 dog
 yeah


and
 I
 don't
 even
 know
 if
 I
 can
 say
 tail


wagging
 the
 dog
 now
 I
 just
 think
 it
 is


the
 dog
 um
 I
 like
 that
 that's
 good
 you


know
 options
 are
 the
 dog
 yeah
 um
 you


know
 those
 type
 of
 real
 and
 synthetic


gamma
 effects
 in
 the
 market
 are
 you
 know


very
 high
 impact
 and
 I
 think
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 day
 a
 lot
 of
 this
 is
 just
 about


career
 preservation.
 Yeah.
 And
 when


you've
 kind
 of
 missed
 badly
 on
 a
 call


people
 it
 feels
 good
 and
 you
 know
 in
 the


macro
 space
 like
 I
 you
 know
 I'm
 super


sensitive
 to
 this
 idea
 you
 know
 you
 feel


smart
 to
 make
 a
 bare
 call
 because
 it's


rare
 stocks
 go
 higher.
 Yeah,
 that's


right.
 You
 know,
 when
 you
 run
 a
 back


test,
 you
 know,
 and
 back
 testing,
 I
 know


is
 like
 a
 four-letter
 word,
 but
 when
 you


run
 a
 back
 test,
 you
 know,
 this
 if
 this


happens
 and
 contingent
 on
 this,
 and
 you


actually
 get
 negative
 forward
 returns


over
 a
 series
 of
 average
 um
 you
 know,


over
 a
 real
 number
 of
 sample
 set,
 um
 you


know,
 it's
 an
 outlier.
 The
 problem
 is


like
 sitting
 in
 a
 negative
 stance
 when


again
 goes
 back
 to
 that
 point,
 people


are
 not
 really
 incentivized
 to
 see
 the


world
 burn.
 You
 know,
 it's
 going
 to
 be
 a


tough
 thing.
 So,
 you
 got
 to
 be
 dynamic


and
 pragmatic
 I
 think
 about
 these


things.
 All
 right.
 Well,
 uh,
 Charlie,


let
 me
 just
 say
 thank
 you
 for
 giving
 us


a
 couple
 swear
 words
 to
 bleep
 out.
 It


really
 helps
 keep
 our
 producers
 on
 their


toes.
