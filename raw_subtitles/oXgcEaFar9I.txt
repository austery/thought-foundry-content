From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 [music]
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumpford.


Today's
 Friday,
 December
 19th.
 Here's


what
 we're
 covering.


>> Good
 evening,
 everybody.


Tonight,
 our
 Providence
 neighbors
 can


finally
 breathe
 a
 little
 easier.
 In
 a


minute,
 Colonel
 Perez
 will
 share
 the


latest
 details
 on
 the


>> Late
 last
 night,
 officials
 announced


that
 the
 suspect
 in
 the
 shooting
 at


Brown
 University
 has
 been
 found
 dead


nearly
 a
 week
 after
 they
 say
 he
 opened


fire
 in
 a
 lecture
 hall,
 killing
 two


students.


>> That
 individual
 was
 identified
 as


Claudio
 Nevice
 Valente
 and
 he
 was
 a


48-year-old
 man.


He
 was
 a
 Portuguese
 national
 and
 his


last
 known
 address
 was
 in
 Miami,


Florida.
 In
 a
 press
 conference,


authorities
 laid
 out
 how
 a
 post
 on


Reddit
 helped
 lead
 them
 to
 the
 suspect


and
 ultimately
 connect
 him
 to
 a
 separate


shooting
 of
 an
 MIT
 professor.
 A
 Reddit


user
 described
 a
 suspicious
 car
 that


he'd
 seen
 on
 Brown's
 campus.
 And
 the
 man


later
 came
 in
 to
 give
 police
 more


details,
 including
 a
 description
 of
 the


suspect.


>> He
 blew
 this
 case
 right
 open.
 He
 blew
 it


open.
 And
 that's
 how
 these
 cases


sometimes
 go.
 Looking
 at
 surveillance


footage,
 authorities
 found
 the
 vehicle


had
 also
 been
 near
 the
 Massachusetts


home
 of
 a
 professor
 at
 MIT
 who
 was


killed
 just
 days
 after
 the
 attack
 at


Brown.
 Initially,
 the
 FBI
 had
 said
 the


cases
 didn't
 seem
 to
 be
 connected.
 They


then
 tracked
 the
 car
 to
 a
 storage


facility
 in
 New
 Hampshire
 where
 the


suspect
 was
 found
 dead
 last
 night
 of
 a


self-inflicted
 gunshot
 wound.
 Officials


say
 the
 motive
 remains
 unclear,
 though


both
 the
 suspect
 and
 the
 MIT
 professor


attended
 the
 same
 physics
 program
 in


Portugal
 in
 the9s.
 The
 suspect
 then
 came


to
 the
 US
 on
 a
 student
 visa
 in
 2000
 and


enrolled
 briefly
 in
 a
 graduate
 program


at
 Brown.
 The
 university's
 president


said
 he
 likely
 spent
 considerable
 time


in
 the
 campus
 building
 where
 the


shooting
 happened.
 [music]


Now,
 three
 quick
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration.


>> We
 want
 our
 hospitals
 returning
 to


healing,
 not
 harming
 the
 patients


entrusted
 with
 their
 care,
 and
 they're


going
 to
 pay
 a
 very
 steep
 price.
 These


actions
 are


>> The
 administration
 is
 moving
 to
 end


gender
 related
 care
 for
 minors
 by


threatening
 to
 pull
 federal
 funding
 from


any
 hospital
 that
 offers
 those


treatments.
 The
 proposed
 rules
 would


effectively
 shut
 down
 hospitals
 that


don't
 comply
 since
 they
 rely
 on
 that


money
 to
 operate.
 Gender-
 related


treatments
 for
 minors
 can
 include


puberty
 blocking
 drugs,
 hormone


therapies,
 and
 in
 rare
 cases,
 surgeries.


Those
 treatments
 have
 been
 endorsed
 by


most
 medical
 groups
 in
 the
 US,
 but
 have


been
 the
 subject
 of
 fierce
 debate,
 and


Trump's
 been
 targeting
 them
 since
 he


returned
 to
 office,
 calling
 the


treatments
 dangerous
 and
 a
 quote
 stain


on
 our
 nation's
 history.


The
 president
 of
 the
 American
 Academy
 of


Pediatrics,
 meanwhile,
 called
 the
 new


proposals
 a
 dangerous
 intrusion
 of
 the


federal
 government
 into
 private
 medical


decisions.


Also,
 in
 a
 separate
 move,


>> this
 reclassification
 order
 will
 make
 it


far
 easier
 to
 conduct
 marijuana
 related


medical
 research,
 allowing
 us
 to
 study


benefits,
 potential
 dangers,
 and
 future


treatments.


President
 Trump
 signed
 an
 executive


order
 to
 downgrade
 cannabis
 from
 a


schedule
 one
 drug,
 the
 most
 restrictive


category,
 to
 a
 schedule
 3.
 The
 change


does
 not
 legalize
 the
 drug,
 which
 many


states
 have
 done,
 but
 is
 instead
 an


acknowledgement
 that
 it
 has
 some


medicinal
 value
 and
 that
 there's
 a
 lower


potential
 for
 abuse.
 Trump's
 order


follows
 steps
 taken
 by
 the
 Biden


administration
 to
 reclassify
 the
 drug,


signaling
 a
 shift
 across
 the
 political


spectrum
 in
 attitudes
 toward
 cannabis.


And
 lastly,
 a
 quick
 follow-up
 on
 the


news
 from
 yesterday
 about
 what
 Trump


called
 warrior
 dividend
 checks
 going
 out


to
 soldiers.
 The
 president
 promised
 that


over
 a
 million
 members
 of
 the
 military


would
 be
 getting
 $1,776


each,
 saying,
 "We
 made
 a
 lot
 more
 money


than
 anybody
 thought
 because
 of
 tariffs.


In
 fact,
 [music]
 the
 checks
 are
 coming


out
 of
 a
 pot
 of
 money
 that
 Congress


allocated
 earlier
 this
 year
 [music]
 for


military
 housing
 stipens.


After
 Kla
 Harris
 lost
 to
 Donald
 Trump
 in


the
 last
 election,
 the
 Democratic


National
 Committee
 ordered
 up
 a
 report


to
 look
 at
 what
 had
 gone
 wrong.
 It's


been
 in
 the
 works
 for
 months,
 and
 party


officials
 did
 more
 than
 300
 interviews


with
 Democrats
 in
 all
 50
 states.
 The


goal
 was
 to
 create
 a
 document
 the
 DNC


chairman
 said
 would
 be
 crucial
 in


charting
 a
 path
 forward.
 But
 now
 the


chairman's
 decided
 not
 to
 release
 it


because
 he
 thinks
 it
 could
 be


counterproductive.
 That
 decision
 has


some
 in
 the
 party
 split.
 There's
 the
 how


can
 we
 address
 problems
 if
 we
 don't
 name


them
 camp
 and
 the
 haven't
 we
 rehashed


2024
 enough
 camp.
 A
 national
 poll
 this


week
 found
 that
 Democrats
 are
 facing
 a


tough
 political
 reality.
 Just
 18%
 of


voters
 approve
 of
 how
 Democrats
 in


Congress
 are
 doing
 their
 jobs,
 a
 record


low.
 But
 there's
 also
 rising


dissatisfaction
 with
 Trump
 and
 the
 GOP.


The
 same
 poll
 showed
 more
 voters
 would


prefer
 Democrats
 to
 control
 Congress


instead
 of
 Republicans.


[music]


Either
 money
 today
 or
 blood
 tomorrow.


And
 I
 am
 not
 talking
 about
 Ukraine
 only.


I'm
 talking
 about
 Europe.


>> Early
 today,
 European
 leaders
 hashed
 out


a
 highstakes
 plan
 for
 how
 to
 keep


supporting
 Ukraine
 in
 the
 face
 of


Russia's
 onslaught.


>> We
 have
 to
 find
 a
 solution
 today
 will


not
 leave
 the
 European
 Council
 without
 a


solution
 for
 the
 funding
 for
 Ukraine
 for


the
 next
 two
 years.


>> Many
 countries
 had
 wanted
 to
 use


Russia's
 own
 money
 to
 do
 that
 by


redirecting
 billions
 of
 dollars
 in


frozen
 assets.
 The
 whole
 idea
 is
 a


stupid
 one
 to
 take
 away
 the
 money
 of


somebody.
 There
 are
 two
 countries
 which


are
 involved.


>> But
 not
 everyone
 was
 on
 board
 with
 that


idea
 including
 the
 prime
 minister
 of


Hungary
 who
 has
 remained
 close
 to


Russian
 leader
 Vladimir
 Putin.
 So


[snorts]
 they
 moved
 on
 to
 plan
 B.


They've
 announced
 they're
 going
 to


funnel
 over
 a hundred
 billion
 dollars
 to


Ukraine
 with
 a
 loan
 backed
 by
 the
 EU


budget.
 The
 timing
 is
 key.
 Ukraine
 is


expected
 to
 begin
 running
 out
 of
 money


in
 early
 2026.
 The
 hope
 is
 that
 this


will
 not
 only
 head
 that
 off,
 but


strengthen
 the
 country's
 position
 in
 the


ongoing
 peace
 negotiations
 that
 the
 US


has
 been
 leading.
 European
 leaders
 also


hope
 it
 will
 demonstrate
 that
 the
 EU
 is


a
 powerful
 force
 in
 its
 own
 right,
 that


should
 have
 a
 say
 in
 those
 negotiations,


even
 as
 President
 Trump
 and
 the
 Kremlin


have
 often
 left
 Europe
 out
 of
 the
 talks.


[music]


And
 finally,
 the
 James
 Webb
 Space


Telescope
 recently
 gathered
 data
 on
 a


planet
 that's
 kind
 of
 stretching
 the


idea
 of
 what
 a
 planet
 can
 be.
 It
 is
 way


wider
 around
 the
 equator
 than
 anywhere


else.
 Basically,
 it's
 kind
 of
 the
 shape


of
 a
 lemon.
 The
 lead
 author
 of
 a
 new


paper
 describing
 it
 said,
 quote,
 "It's


the
 stretchiest
 planet
 that
 we've


confirmed
 the
 stretchiness
 of.
 It
 orbits


a
 pulsar.
 That's
 what's
 left
 of
 a
 star


after
 it
 goes
 supernova.
 And
 that's


what's
 giving
 it
 the
 unusual
 shape,
 the


stars
 gravity
 pulling
 on
 it.
 It
 is
 such


a
 strange
 phenomenon
 and
 has
 such
 a


strange
 atmosphere,
 researchers
 think
 it


might
 not
 even
 be
 a
 planet
 at
 all.
 It


could
 be
 the
 remnants
 of
 a
 star
 in
 its


own
 right,
 basically
 being
 eaten
 alive


by
 the
 first.
 Or
 it
 could
 be
 quote
 an


entirely
 new
 type
 of
 object
 that
 we


don't
 have
 a
 name
 for.
 For
 now,
 it's


just
 PSRJ2322-2650B.


Catchy.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 If
 you'd
 like


to
 play
 the
 Friday
 News
 quiz,
 [music]


it's
 just
 after
 these
 credits.
 This
 show


is

 Jarvis,

 Yan
 Stewart,
 and
 me,
 Tracy


Mumford.

>> Now,
 time
 for
 the
 quiz.
 We
 have
 a
 few


questions
 about
 stories
 the
 Times
 has


been
 covering
 this
 week.
 Can
 you
 get


them
 all?


First
 up,


>> we
 just
 had
 traffic
 passed
 directly
 in


front
 of
 us,
 within
 5
 miles
 of
 us,
 maybe


two,
 three
 miles,
 and
 he
 was
 at
 our


altitude.


This
 week,
 the
 Times
 reported
 on
 a


recent
 close
 call
 for
 a
 JetBlue
 flight


that
 was
 going
 from
 Kurissau
 in
 the


Caribbean
 to
 New
 York
 City.
 Just
 20


minutes
 after
 takeoff,
 the
 plane


suddenly
 leveled
 off,
 stopping
 its


climb.
 The
 pilot
 told
 air
 traffic


control,
 "We
 almost
 had
 a
 midair


collision
 up
 here.
 What
 did
 the
 flight


narrowly
 avoid
 colliding
 with?"


the
 answer.
 The
 pilot
 said
 he
 almost
 hit


a
 US
 military
 aircraft.


>> They
 passed
 directly
 uh
 in
 our
 flight


path.
 They
 don't
 have
 their
 transponder


turned
 on.
 It's
 outrageous.


>> He
 told
 the
 controller
 that
 the


refueling
 tanker
 was
 flying
 without


broadcasting
 its
 position,
 and
 he
 didn't


notice
 it
 until
 it
 was
 only
 2
 or
 3
 miles


away.
 That
 might
 sound
 far,
 but
 it's


less
 than
 20
 seconds
 flying
 time
 at
 its


speed.
 The
 skies
 over
 the
 Caribbean
 have


become
 increasingly
 crowded
 lately
 as


the
 US
 has
 built
 up
 more
 of
 a
 military


presence
 against
 Venezuela.


Okay,
 next
 question.


>> These
 are
 great
 guys.
 They
 look
 like


male
 models
 with
 a
 brain.
 You
 know,


they're
 male
 models
 with
 a
 big,


beautiful
 brain.


>> Since
 returning
 to
 office,
 President


Trump's
 become
 a
 fan
 of
 a
 pair
 of


brothers
 who've
 made
 a
 splash
 in


cryptocurrency.
 A
 Times
 investigation


detailed
 how
 the
 men
 have
 forged
 close


ties
 to
 the
 Trump
 administration,


donating
 to
 the
 planned
 East-Wing


Ballroom,
 for
 example,
 and
 making


multiple
 trips
 to
 the
 White
 House.
 But


they
 were
 once
 in
 the
 news
 for
 a


different
 billion
 dollar
 reason.
 Who
 are


they?


A
 hint?


>> We
 don't
 even
 have
 to
 do
 that.
 That's


right.
 We
 could
 do
 that
 ourselves.
 I'm


65,
 220,
 and
 there's
 two
 of
 me.
 I'm


>> Whatever.
 I'm
 saying
 let's
 calm
 down


until
 we
 know
 what
 we're
 talking
 about.


One
 actor
 played
 both
 of
 them
 in
 an


Oscar-winning
 movie.


The
 answer,
 the
 Wlvoss
 twins.
 They


famously
 claimed
 that
 Facebook
 was


originally
 their
 idea,
 not
 Mark


Zuckerberg's,
 a
 feud
 that
 was
 captured


in
 the
 film
 The
 Social
 Network.
 They


went
 on
 to
 become
 early
 investors
 in


Bitcoin,
 became
 billionaires
 as
 crypto


took
 off,
 and
 have
 benefited
 from
 the


Trump
 administration's
 more
 lax
 stance


toward
 crypto
 regulation.


And
 final
 question,
 many
 people
 this


week
 have
 been
 taking
 the
 time
 to


rewatch
 their
 favorite
 Robiner
 films
 in


the
 wake
 of
 his
 death
 and
 the
 death
 of


his
 wife,
 Michelle
 Singer
 Reiner.
 He
 may


have
 been
 best
 known
 for
 directing,


including
 classics
 like
 The
 Princess


Bride
 and
 Standby
 Me,
 but
 he
 also
 had
 a


lot
 of
 acting
 credits
 over
 the
 years
 on


TV
 and
 film.
 We
 are
 going
 to
 play
 you
 a


few
 clips
 of
 Reiner's
 onscreen
 roles.


Can
 you
 name
 the
 show
 or
 movie?
 First


one,


>> Priscilla,
 come
 here.
 Come
 here.
 I
 want


you
 to
 meet
 my
 daughter,
 Jessica.


Remember
 I
 told
 you
 about
 her?
 She's
 the


one
 that
 doesn't
 play
 tennis.


>> Oh,
 the
 teacher
 from
 Hollywood.


Next
 up,


>> tell
 them
 about
 the
 sides
 you
 want.


>> The
 sides
 sides.


>> SIDES.
 SIDES.
 $26,000


WORTH
 OF
 SIDES.
 WHAT
 ARE
 THESE
 SIDES?


THEY
 CURE
 CANCER.


>> AND
 last
 one.


>> The
 good
 news
 is
 you
 split
 the
 check.


>> I
 don't
 think
 I
 could
 let
 a
 woman
 pay


for
 dinner.


>> Great.
 They'll
 throw
 a
 parade,
 your


honor.
 You'll
 be
 man
 of
 the
 year
 in


Seattle
 magazine.


>> One
 more
 time.


>> Come
 here.
 Come
 here.
 I
 want
 you
 to
 meet


my
 daughter,
 JESSICA.
 $26,000


WORTH
 OF
 SIZE.


>> They'll
 throw
 a
 parade,
 your
 honor.


You'll
 be
 man
 of
 the
 year
 in
 Seattle


magazine.


>> That
 was
 in
 order.
 New
 Girl,
 where
 Riner


played
 the
 very
 protective
 father
 of
 Zoe


Desanel's
 character.
 The
 Wolf
 of
 Wall


Street,
 another
 father
 role,
 this
 time


for
 Leonardo
 DiCaprio's
 hard
 partying


stock
 broker.
 And
 Sleepless
 in
 Seattle,


in
 which
 he
 gives
 dating
 advice
 to
 a
 new


widowerower,
 played
 by
 Tom
 Hanks.
 One


bonus
 question.
 Riner's
 wife,
 Michelle


Singer
 Reiner,
 is
 credited
 with
 changing


the
 course
 of
 movie
 history
 because


meeting
 her
 inspired
 Rob
 Reiner
 to


change
 the
 end
 of
 one
 of
 his
 most


beloved
 films.
 What
 was
 it?


The
 answer.
 When
 Harry
 met
 Sally.


Originally,
 Harry
 and
 Sally
 were
 not


going
 to
 end
 up
 together,
 [music]
 but
 as


Reiner
 later
 remembered,
 then
 I
 met


Michelle
 and
 I
 thought,
 "Okay,
 I


[clears throat]
 see
 how
 this
 works."
