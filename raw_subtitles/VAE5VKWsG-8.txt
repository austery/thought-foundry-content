From
 the
 [music]
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's


the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.


Today's
 Friday,
 January
 9th.
 Here's
 what


we're
 covering.


>> Your
 talk
 group
 is
 going
 to
 be
 off
 one


engine
 7
 with
 medic
 314.
 They
 have
 a


male
 who
 was
 shot
 twice
 in
 the
 arm
 and


his
 wife
 who
 was
 shot
 in
 the
 chest.


Police
 are
 in
 route.
 In
 Portland,
 Oregon


yesterday,
 Border
 Patrol
 agents
 fired
 on


two
 people
 during
 a
 traffic
 stop
 just
 a


day
 after
 an
 ICE
 officer
 fatally
 shot
 a


woman
 in
 Minneapolis.
 A
 Homeland


Security
 spokeswoman
 said
 the
 agent
 in


Portland
 fired
 after
 the
 driver
 tried
 to


run
 them
 over.
 The
 department
 made
 the


same
 claim
 in
 Minneapolis,
 though
 video


analysis
 by
 the
 times
 appeared
 to


contradict
 that.
 In
 Portland,
 the


spokeswoman
 said
 border
 patrol
 was


targeting
 an
 undocumented
 immigrant
 who


was
 a
 member
 of
 the
 Trend
 Ara
 gang.


>> We
 know
 what
 the
 federal
 government
 says


happened
 here.
 There
 was
 a
 time
 when
 we


could
 take
 them
 at
 their
 word.


That
 time
 is
 long
 past.


>> Portland's
 mayor
 called
 for
 an


independent
 investigation
 and
 said
 the


shooting
 was
 a
 sign
 that
 federal


immigration
 efforts
 are
 out
 of
 control.


>> Portland
 is
 not
 a
 training
 ground
 for


militarized
 agents.


We
 stand
 with
 Minneapolis.
 We
 stand
 with


Chicago.
 We
 stand
 with
 LA.


>> The
 Portland
 police
 chief
 said
 his


officers
 only
 learned
 about
 the
 shooting


when
 the
 injured
 man
 called
 911.
 He
 had


driven
 off
 and
 paramedics
 reached
 the


victims
 more
 than
 2
 miles
 from
 where
 the


traffic
 stop
 happened.
 On
 emergency


radio
 broadcasts,
 an
 EMT
 said
 that
 the


woman
 in
 the
 car
 had
 a
 chest
 wound.
 The


police
 chief
 said
 when
 his
 officers
 did


get
 to
 the
 scene,
 the
 federal
 agents


involved
 in
 the
 shooting
 were
 no
 longer


there.


Meanwhile,
 the
 Times
 has
 learned
 that


several
 weeks
 ago,
 officials
 at
 ICE


headquarters
 sent
 out
 a
 stark
 warning
 to


its
 agents
 across
 the
 country.
 In
 an


email,
 they
 were
 told
 about
 an
 increase


in
 protests
 and
 threats
 against


officers.
 And
 the
 email
 said
 that
 they


should
 be
 quote
 prepared
 to
 take


appropriate
 and
 decisive
 action
 should


you
 be
 faced
 with
 an
 imminent
 threat.
 It


was
 signed
 by
 the
 head
 of
 enforcement


and
 removal
 operations
 who
 wrote,
 "I


have
 full
 faith
 and
 confidence
 [music]


that
 each
 of
 you
 possess
 the
 training


and
 knowledge
 to
 exercise
 the


appropriate
 response.


>> [music]


>> Do
 you
 see
 any
 checks
 on
 your
 power
 on


the
 world
 stage?
 Is
 there
 anything
 that


could
 stop
 you
 if
 you
 wanted?


>> Yeah,
 there's
 one
 thing.
 My
 own


morality,


my
 own
 mind.
 It's
 the
 only
 thing
 that


can
 stop
 and
 that's
 very
 good.
 In
 an


interview
 with
 the
 Times
 this
 week,


President
 Trump
 laid
 out
 the
 most
 blunt


articulation
 yet
 of
 his
 worldview,


saying
 that
 he
 is
 the
 only
 check
 on
 his


power
 as
 commander-in-chief
 when
 it


comes
 to
 foreign
 affairs.
 He
 said,


quote,
 I
 don't
 need
 international
 law.


>> We
 have
 to
 keep
 parts
 of
 the
 world
 safe


that
 we
 feel
 responsible
 for.
 NATO
 is


not
 feared
 by
 Russia
 or
 China
 at
 all.


Not
 even
 a
 little
 bit.
 We're


tremendously
 feared
 because
 of
 the
 fact


that
 I
 built
 a
 military.
 If
 I
 didn't


rebuild
 the
 military,
 we'd
 be
 just
 like


them.


>> Trump
 asserted
 that
 he
 has
 complete


freedom
 to
 use
 military,
 economic,
 or


political
 power
 to
 secure
 American


dominance
 around
 the
 world.
 Brushing


aside
 things
 like
 treaties
 on
 topic


after
 topic
 while
 sitting
 down
 with


Times
 reporters,
 Trump
 made
 clear
 that


in
 his
 mind,
 previous
 presidents
 had


been
 too
 cautious
 to
 use
 American
 force


to
 its
 full
 potential.
 And
 he
 also
 made


clear
 that
 he
 intentionally
 uses
 his


reputation
 for
 unpredictability
 as
 well


as
 his
 willingness
 to
 quickly
 resort
 to


military
 action
 as
 a
 way
 of
 coercing


other
 countries.


[music]


Meanwhile,


>> make
 no
 mistake,
 [music]


bombing
 another
 nation's
 capital
 and


removing
 their
 president
 is
 an
 act
 of


war.
 Plain
 and
 simple.
 No
 provision
 in


the
 Constitution
 provides
 such
 power
 to


the
 presidency.


>> The
 Senate
 delivered
 a
 rare
 bipartisan


rebuke
 of
 Trump
 yesterday
 with
 52


lawmakers
 voting
 to
 advance
 a
 measure


that
 would
 curb
 the
 president's
 use
 of


force
 in
 Venezuela.
 Trump
 launched
 the


US's
 recent
 actions
 there
 with
 no


consultation
 or
 authorization
 by


Congress.
 And
 Senator
 Ran
 Paul
 suggested


that
 part
 of
 what
 convinced
 a
 handful
 of


Republicans
 to
 join
 with
 Democrats
 in


the
 vote
 was
 Trump
 saying
 this
 week
 that


the
 US
 could
 be
 involved
 in
 Venezuela


for
 years.
 The
 stage
 is
 now
 set
 for


another
 vote
 next
 week
 that
 would
 force


Trump
 to
 get
 congressional
 approval
 for


continued
 operations
 in
 Venezuela,


though
 Trump
 could
 veto
 any
 measure
 that


Congress
 eventually
 passes.
 In
 a
 post
 on


social
 media,
 Trump
 lashed
 out
 at
 the


five
 Republicans
 [music]
 who
 voted
 to


assert
 congressional
 authority
 over
 his


war
 powers.
 He
 called
 it
 stupidity
 and


urged
 voters
 to
 push
 them
 out
 of
 office.


[music]


>> [cheering]


>> In
 Iran,
 nationwide
 protests
 against
 the


country's
 authoritarian
 government


escalated
 last
 night.
 Crowds
 gathered
 in


Thyron
 and
 other
 major
 cities,
 setting


cars
 and
 government
 buildings
 on
 fire.


For
 weeks,
 unrest
 has
 been
 building
 in


the
 country
 as
 people
 have
 taken
 to
 the


streets
 in
 anger
 over
 a
 range
 of
 issues.


The
 biggest
 one,
 Iran's
 failing
 economy.


Last
 month
 alone,
 inflation
 was
 over


40%.
 The
 government
 has
 tried
 to
 quell


the
 protests
 with
 a
 range
 of
 measures.


They
 recently
 announced
 a
 plan
 to
 give


most
 citizens
 a
 monthly
 payment
 of
 about


$7,
 roughly
 enough
 to
 buy
 two
 pizzas
 in


Tyrron.
 And
 yesterday,
 the
 country's


internet
 was
 shut
 down
 after
 Iran's


security
 services
 said
 they
 would
 take


tough
 measures
 against
 demonstrators.


[music]
 reached
 by
 phone.
 More
 than
 a


dozen
 witnesses
 told
 the
 Times
 the


protests
 [music]
 still
 continued
 with


large
 crowds
 forming
 in
 cities
 around


the
 country.
 They
 said
 the
 crowds
 were


diverse,
 men,
 women,
 young,
 old.
 Some


chanted
 death
 to
 ham,
 a
 [music]


reference
 to
 Iran's
 Supreme
 Leader.


Human
 rights
 groups
 say
 that
 in
 recent


days,
 [music]
 dozens
 of
 people
 have
 been


killed
 in
 clashes
 with
 government


forces.


And
 finally,


>> you
 can
 bet
 on
 anything.
 Super
 Bowl


winners,
 crypto
 prices,
 even
 Taylor


Swift's
 engagement.


>> The
 betting
 site
 Poly
 Market
 has
 become


an
 internet
 and
 financial
 phenomenon.


>> Elections,
 inflation,
 celebrity


breakouts,
 aliens.
 If
 people
 care
 about


it,
 there
 is
 a
 market.


>> Roughly
 $20
 billion
 went
 through
 the


platform
 last
 year
 with
 people
 gambling


on
 things
 you
 didn't
 even
 know
 it
 was


possible
 to
 bet
 on.
 Now
 the
 site
 has


sparked
 a
 truly
 bizarre
 situation
 that


has
 the
 internet
 debating
 what
 does
 it


mean
 to
 really
 invade
 a
 country
 on
 Poly


Market.
 A
 bunch
 of
 people
 had
 bet
 that


the
 US
 would
 invade
 Venezuela.
 So
 when


US
 forces
 swept
 in
 and
 seized
 the


country's
 leader
 Nicholas
 Maduro,
 they


thought
 they
 were
 about
 to
 collect
 their


winnings.
 But
 Poly
 Market
 has
 added
 a


note
 to
 the
 page
 for
 that
 particular
 bet


saying
 the
 US
 mission
 was
 a
 snatch
 and


extract
 job
 and
 that
 technically
 doesn't


count
 as
 an
 invasion.
 Users
 didn't
 love


that
 with
 one
 posting
 everyone
 is


calling
 it
 an
 invasion.
 The
 company


declined
 to
 comment
 when
 the
 Times


reached
 out
 and
 the
 government
 agency


which
 regulates
 Poly
 Market,
 the


Commodities
 Futures
 Trading
 Commission,


didn't
 respond.
 [music]
 At
 present,


people
 are
 still
 pouring
 money
 into


other
 bets
 on
 the
 site,
 like
 if
 the
 US


will
 acquire
 Greenland.


[music]
 Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 If


you'd
 like
 to
 play
 the
 Friday
 news
 quiz,


it
 is
 just
 after
 these
 credits.
 [music]


This
 show
 is
 made
 by
 Will
 Jarvis,
 Yan


Stewart,
 and
 me,
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 [music]


Original
 theme
 by
 Dan
 Powell.
 Special


thanks
 to
 Isabella
 Anderson,
 Lissa


Anderson,
 Zoe
 Murphy,
 [music]
 and
 Paula


Schuman.


Now,
 time
 for
 the
 quiz.
 We've
 got
 a
 few


questions
 for
 you
 about
 stories
 the


Times
 has
 been
 covering.
 [music]
 Buckle


up.


>> Does
 the
 US
 intend
 to
 buy
 Greenland?


>> Well,
 that's
 always
 been
 the
 president's


intent
 from
 the
 very
 beginning.
 He
 said,


>> "We
 need
 Greenland."


>> This
 week,
 the
 Trump
 administration


doubled
 down
 on
 its
 plans
 to
 acquire


Greenland.


>> Obviously,
 Greenland
 should
 be
 part
 of


the
 United
 States,


>> even
 over
 the
 objections
 of
 Greenland


and
 some
 of
 America's
 closest
 allies.


So,
 here
 is
 a
 quick
 speed
 round
 for
 you,


testing
 your
 knowledge
 of
 the
 island


Trump
 says
 should
 be
 part
 of
 the
 US.
 We


got
 four
 questions.
 Ready?
 First,


Greenland
 is
 a
 semi-autonomous
 territory


of
 what
 country?
 [music]
 The
 answer,


Denmark.
 Its
 capital
 city
 is


[music]


Nuke.
 Okay.
 Number
 three,
 Greenland's


entire
 population
 [music]
 is
 roughly
 the


same
 size
 as
 which
 of
 these
 US
 cities?


San
 Francisco,
 Portland,
 Maine,
 or


Omaha,
 Nebraska?


The
 answer,
 [music]


there
 are
 only
 about
 58,000
 people
 in


Greenland.
 That
 is
 just
 a
 little
 bit


less
 than
 Portland,
 Maine.
 [music]
 And


last
 question,
 it
 is
 a
 toughy
 because


there
 is
 so
 little
 vegetation
 on
 the


island.
 [music]
 Historically,


Greenlanders
 got
 a
 lot
 of
 their
 vitamin


C
 from
 what?


[music]


The
 answer,
 whale
 skin,
 which
 apparently


is
 a
 very
 rich
 source
 of
 the
 vitamin.


Next
 up,
 speaking
 of
 getting
 your


vitamins,
 this
 week,
 health
 officials


rolled
 out
 new
 dietary
 guidelines,


including
 a
 revamped
 food
 pyramid.
 And


Dr.
 Memed
 Oz,
 who
 serves
 in
 the


administration,
 talked
 up
 some
 of
 the


other
 updated
 health
 advice,
 saying
 it


was
 in
 keeping
 with
 places
 that
 are


famous
 for
 long
 lifespans.


>> If
 you
 look
 at
 the
 blue
 zones,
 for


example,
 around
 the
 world
 where
 people


live
 the
 longest
 is
 sometimes
 part
 of


their
 diet.
 So
 there
 is
 on
 these
 dietary


guidelines,
 but
 the
 implication
 is
 don't


have
 it
 for
 breakfast.


>> What
 food
 or
 beverage
 was
 he
 talking


about?


In
 the
 best
 case
 scenario,
 I
 don't
 think


you
 should
 drink
 alcohol,
 but
 it
 does


allow
 people
 an
 excuse
 to
 bond
 and


socialize,
 and
 there's
 probably
 nothing


healthier
 than
 having
 a
 good
 time
 with


friends
 in
 a
 safe
 way.


>> The
 new
 federal
 guidance
 on
 drinking


says
 people
 should
 limit
 their
 alcohol


consumption,
 though
 it
 no
 longer
 lists


specific
 amounts.
 [music]


And
 last
 question
 for
 you.
 [music]


>> The
 sparkling
 acrobatics
 of
 Chicago


goalie
 Glenn
 Hall
 prevent
 the
 Red
 Wings


from
 scoring


>> this
 week.
 The
 NHL
 goalie
 who


fundamentally
 changed
 the
 game
 of
 hockey


died
 at
 the
 age
 of
 94.


>> Hall
 is
 virtually
 indestructible.


>> Before
 Glenn
 Hall
 came
 along,
 goalie


spent
 almost
 the
 entire
 game
 standing


up.
 But
 Hall
 started
 dropping
 to
 his


knees
 so
 he
 could
 spread
 his
 lower
 legs


out
 on
 the
 ice.
 and
 basically
 block
 the


entire
 net.
 If
 you
 watch
 a
 hockey
 game


today,
 almost
 every
 goalie
 uses
 that


technique.
 Your
 question,
 what
 is
 it


called?
 Don't
 worry,
 there
 are
 hints.


There
 are
 hints.
 I
 will
 give
 you
 a
 few


phrases
 that
 use
 the
 word.
 Think
 the


blank
 effect,


a
 blank
 knife,


or
 float
 like
 a
 blank?


The
 answer,
 it's
 called
 the
 butterfly


style,
 which
 brought
 Hall
 way
 closer
 to


the
 ice.
 And
 fun
 fact,
 I
 guess
 it's
 fun,


he
 was
 doing
 this
 before
 goalies
 wearing


masks
 was
 standard,
 and
 he
 had
 the
 scars


to
 prove
 it.
 Over
 the
 course
 of
 Hall's


career,
 he
 estimated
 he
 got
 over
 300


stitches
 from
 flying
 pucks.
 After
 one


shot
 on
 goal
 left
 him
 with
 a
 big
 gash


and
 knocked
 out
 a
 tooth,
 he
 said
 he


remembered
 a
 dentist
 telling
 him
 how


lucky
 he
 was.
 He
 said
 he
 replied
 through


swollen
 [music]
 lips,
 "I
 don't
 feel


lucky."


That
 is
 it
 for
 the
 news
 quiz.
 I'm
 going


to
 go
 count
 my
 teeth.
 Our
 email
 is
 the


headlines

 ny

 We
 will
 be


back
 on
 Monday.
