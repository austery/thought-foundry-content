If I'm a construction
worker working on a Skyrise or something.
And I am not wearing my helmet
and I fall off a 60 storey building,
I would be dead.
But let's assume that I get injured.
Probably be dead.
I would probably be dead.
All right.
A three storey building.
Yeah. Okay.
One story.
Okay. But I'm not wearing my helmet.
Even though my employer says
I should be wearing a helmet,
and then I, you know, file a claim.
The absolute liability rule basically says
that you can't divide blame
between the company and the worker.
Is that right?
So I'm instead of being 90% at fault
for my own injury
because I wasn't wearing a helmet
and I got a head injury.
The company is now 100% at fault.
That's absolutely right.
And in other
states, they do comparative negligence,
and it's really driving up
the cost of insurance.
So much so that insurers
don't even want to write insurance
in New York anymore.
Hello,
and welcome to another episode of the Odd
Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal. And I'm Tracy Alloway.
So Tracy,
everyone just like going to affordability
these days is the cost of living
and all that stuff.
But I think, you know, there's all kinds
of things you can do and whatever.
But it seems like one fundamental thing,
which I think is probably true
is whatever we're talking about,
whether it's building
infrastructure for public transportation,
whether it's building offices,
whether it's building houses,
like there's various costs involved.
But one is like
just the cost of construction
and the cost of construction is very high.
It's hard to imagine affordability
improving much on anything.
Right?
So for I yes, absolutely.
I can't really debate that point.
But it does seem like construction
is there's like one area
where so many different things
come into play.
So you have the cost of basic materials
which have gone up,
especially since the pandemic.
You have the cost of labor,
which is also gone up since the pandemic.
You have the cost of insurance.
Yeah,
which has also gone up since the pandemic.
You have regulations which we've done
many, many episodes about the added costs
from the permitting process
for various things.
It just seems like it's a bucket
where you can throw
all these different factors in
and then get this.
I kind of like reinforces itself
and just makes it even more expensive.
Yeah, totally.
And then, you know,
you got you sort of hit
it with the insurance,
but also just like cost of financing.
Right. Because like as interest rates
go high.
That financing that too.
That's a big bucket. It's a big bucket.
And like we know that construction
is an area across the economy,
not just in New York City.
Where we talked about it
with residential housing,
there hasn't been a lot of productivity
growth. Right?
So like there's been like no
productivity growth,
according to at least one paper I read,
I think it was a Richmond fed paper.
I will have to go back and check.
But it's a really unusual industry in
the sense that you haven't actually seen,
you know,
we don't have robots building houses.
We don't have, robots building houses yet.
So I don't know, you know,
I think we need to learn more.
You know, sometimes you see these viral
statistics like, oh, the MTA spent
$60 million on building an elevator
or cost $3 million to build.
7 million installing those plastic
fins on the subway turnstiles.
I'm not even sure that qualifies
as construction, but 7 million.
Or millions to build a bathroom,
which is not fun.
If, like, you have little kids
who, you know, oh, all kinds of things.
Anyway, we should do more
about why it cost a lot to build.
And, maybe whether there's something
that can be done about it.
Absolutely. Let's start.
Well, I'm very excited to say that we
really do have two perfect guests today.
We're going to be talking
about the high cost of construction
for more infrastructure
and stuff like that.
In New York City, we're going to be
speaking with Elizabeth Crowley.
She's the president
and CEO of the Building Trades Employers
Association, also known as BTEA.
As well as Michael Capasso.
He is the president and CEO of CAC
industries, Inc..
So, Elizabeth and Michael,
thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots
Thank you for having us. Yeah.
Thank you, Joe and Tracy.
We are grateful for the opportunity
to talk today.
You know, I represent, over 1200
contractors in the BTA who are building
our skyscrapers, our subways,
building commercial buildings,
hospitals, schools,
about $65 billion worth of work annually.
And, what does that tell us about
CSC industries?
What's your background?
Michael?
She she's, public works heavy highway
contractor based in New York City.
In Queens.
We work for the public agencies, Port
Authority of New York, Department
of Design and Construction, Department
of Environmental protection.
MTA. Amazing.
Battery Park city.
Did you do the Highline as well? Yes.
That's amazing.
You know that?
I had to do some research
before I come on this podcast.
I know a lot of people don't think
so, but, you know, a little bit.
Okay, let me ask the first question.
Let's just get it out of the way.
But, you know, your organization
represents unionized workers,
and I think your company is also unionized
workers.
A lot of people are going to hear
a high cost of construction in NYC
and immediately go to the union factor.
What is your response to that?
Well, our, members are employers,
so they're they're really businesses.
We're a business association,
and our members are employing over 100,000
workers.
And, we're proud
that we're union contractors.
You know, we're the good guys.
And there are a lot
of nonunion contractors out there
that are racing to the bottom.
We're paying for benefits and wages.
And, you know, that's
just part of the cost of construction.
And really, what we're looking at doing
is reforming costs
that are more control about,
you know, the costs, the hidden costs
that go into construction,
such as construction insurance.
Definitely want to talk about.
I mean, we definitely want to talk about
construction insurance and all this stuff.
But again, just on this point of like
how much is hidden cause versus
how much is just labor,
maybe Michael, you could like
sort of break down or either one of you
break down how we should think about
like in a given project
when people see these big numbers,
how much should people think about this?
Is the labor component specifically versus
measuring these these other costs?
Yeah.
I mean, I would say
typically labor ranges 30
to 35% of the total construction cost.
But getting back
to your original statements about union,
and sometimes people think
that raises the cost of construction,
I would actually take the counterargument
to that.
All the public works contracts in New York
and the utility contracts
are subject to the city
or the state prevailing wage laws,
which the unions rates are in line with,
labor Law 220, which are in the city
contracts, was the wages and benefits
you have to pay the employees.
So it's not the union wages that are,
costing too much money.
They're in line with all the rules
and regulations of the city and state.
I think when we think about union wages
and why maybe there's this misconception.
Yes. Compared to people
that are not paying union wages,
these people are paying
good, honest wages and benefits
for the work they put in during the day.
There are people who cut corners
who don't pay that fair market rate,
which is where that kind of concept
comes from.
And look, there's a lot of cost
to the delays and delays.
Yeah, I mean, look at our government
leaders now.
We have a new mayor
in the city of New York who,
believes
that we should pay baristas $40 an hour.
So when mine talks about
the cost of union labor, it's
not much more, an hourly rate.
And these are inherently dangerous jobs.
But we have a mayor that wants to build
more abundantly.
Wants to cut the time it takes to build.
So the land use process
from two years down to under six months,
and we support that.
And the stars are aligning
also with the governor.
You know,
she has an ambitious plan to build
a new, subway or railway from Brooklyn.
The Queens.
We haven't built like that
in, like, over 100 years.
She's,
in her
budget, going after environmental review.
I mean, environmental review
should only take a few months.
You can see that process
sometimes take well over a few years.
Some, bad cases, five years.
And so what, we're doing here,
as, an industry leader, the BTA,
we're looking to reform insurance costs
so that we can not only build
more abundantly, build faster,
but bring down the cost.
And this is a substantial cost.
We found out from a recent report
that nearly 10% of construction costs
are wasted, in
New York, as opposed to any other state,
even expensive states like California.
The cost of insurance is only about 2%
for the total project cost,
where we're spending upwards of 1,012%.
I definitely want to talk about insurance,
but you said something interesting there
that just reminded me
you said delays add to the cost pressure.
This might be a dumb question,
but why is that?
Because I think back to like my own home
construction projects.
If I have a contractor and he's, you know,
he says it's going to take six weeks,
but then he gets caught up
on another project
and ends up taking eight weeks,
that the cost usually doesn't go up.
It's just frustrating for me because
I have to live in a construction site.
Also, I want to say my contractor knows
I have a podcast.
He's a very good contractor.
Delays rarely happen,
so thank you very much.
But why would that cause
additional, expenses.
Or just sheer time?
I mean, what can be controllable?
Certainly the land use process.
Before representing the BTA,
I was a New York City Council member.
So I served for nine years.
And a quick case.
By the time it goes to the local community
board, the borough president's office,
and then comes to the council with the
best lobbyists happens within two years.
And so, if the mayor could get that,
narrowed down in the council
speaker is also pledging
to reduce the time
to a window of less than six months.
That's a 25% of the average.
And so that's significant time saved.
That's something
that we should be able to control.
And if our government leaders
want to control it, that's real reform.
Can you actually you know what we talk
a lot like this is I'm not surprised
at all to hear about like delays
and particularly environmental review.
People like to talk about this.
Let's actually talk
about a little bit more granularly like
so like you get like some project
that you want to do, I don't know,
maybe something with a highway
or something like that,
and you have some time frame
or some window that you think like
you could get this done
and then we always hear on delays, right?
What is, what are what are what,
what drives the delays, who intervenes
and what are the processes by which
like these calendars get very extended.
There could be design errors
or omissions in the, in the bid documents.
Okay.
So when you actually go out
to commence construction
and do your preliminary work, the drawings
don't match up with actual field
conditions, which then result in changes
to the contract.
And that process can be very lengthy.
So now we have to document the changes.
You then as a contractor
with one of the public agencies
need to negotiate those changes,
then get it approved.
Depending on what the agency has,
it could be with the comptroller's office
in the City of New York
or if it's at the MTA with the board
or whoever approves it at the MTA.
And all those steps take time.
While those delays
are being incurred, contract or are then
experiencing indirect overhead costs
that are assigned to the project?
Well, no productive work.
Explaining that one of these indirect
overhead.
Costs
project managers, project supervisor and
safety
directors, quality assurance personnel,
all sorts of.
So their their salaries
and their fees continue to run.
You can't reassign them to another project
while they're waiting.
Correct. They're assigned to a project.
You don't know when those processes
will come to an end.
So, you know,
it could go very expeditiously.
It could be delayed longer,
depending on how complex the changes are.
So that project staff
sits there in theory under utilized.
And then as is our contractual right,
we will file a claim
with that contracting agency
for those additional costs.
Coupled with that, and I don't know how
these costs are calculated, the agency
internally also has those same costs
for the people on those projects,
whether in house staff
or through third party
consultants, a combination of the two.
So those costs all get compounded
while these changes happen.
I mean, what are the last projects I
funded as a council member was to pay for,
turf?
In a park, like, just like,
running athletic fields replacement,
simple replacement.
It was funded fully in the budget.
I left the council in 2017.
They only, cut the ribbon on that project
being fully completed.
Just in 2024.
So what happened in those seven?
Like, what are these study like?
Do you buy the turf?
You stick it on the ground.
How would you describe
what happened in the past.
And said it was going to be a $4
million field replacement, then,
when they, you know,
the contractor came out to the site,
there was a lot of surface repair
underneath that that needed to happen.
Underlying, you know, just,
you know, uneven surface
or something like that.
They sent it back.
I had to go back before Design
Review Council.
I mean, by the time it
it really is something so small
and so simple that shouldn't even cost
as much as it does.
Gets away for far too long.
And, we need real reform.
And city government,
I believe, government leaders are,
you know, are finally addressing this
as an impediment to building, abundant.
Like, really?
Yeah.
So this just reminded me
this is something else I want to ask.
But when you mentioned site reviews,
is there something unique
or sort of inherent about the way
New York City is laid out and built
and its geography,
that also makes it more expensive?
I'm thinking, like in Manhattan,
obviously we have crowded buildings
in some of Manhattan on reclaimed land.
I can't remember now.
What Battery
Park City is on reclaimed land.
There we go reclaim land, and it's mostly
an island with few ins and outs.
Right?
So I imagine there are some restrictions
on how much material
you can actually get into the city.
Does it just the physicality of the city
make it more expensive?
Yeah,
all that's built into the contract costs.
So when we're getting vendor quotes
for different types of materials
that will go into a construction project,
most of the
manufacturing base
is not within the five boroughs, right?
So it's coming
either from upstate out on Long Island,
new Jersey,
maybe Pennsylvania, southern new Jersey.
You have the cost of that transportation
into the five boroughs.
Right?
So this if you're a vendor who's
manufacturing somewhere in central Jersey,
well,
you probably can make multiple deliveries
within the state of new Jersey,
where maybe that same freight
carrier can only make one delivery a day
into the five boroughs.
Yeah. There
may I mean, I would make sense.
By the way, there's a great, Ken
Burns brother, whose name I'm forgetting.
He made a great documentary
about New York, and there's a whole one.
It's like a 10 hour or 11 hour
documentary, and there's a whole section
on the speed with which steel got
from the Bethlehem steel mill to build,
one of the Chrysler Building
or something like that. It's
just an unbelievable logistics, I imagine
would be a little bit slower today.
All right, can we let's get to insurance
and all of that stuff.
You even brought us a nice report.
Reading.
Material scaffold law, economic impact,
which evidently, even though on
the cover of the report has a picture of a
scaffold, is not about scaffold.
Not just about sky.
Yeah, not about scaffold per se.
Per se, but.
What is the scaffold law and why is this
like an important priority of.
Yours?
Well, like, if,
a worker was to fall off the scaffold,
then the scaffold law would apply,
and it's to any, height related injury.
A New York contractor, New York City
contractor is held 100% liable.
And in 49 other states,
it's comparable negligence.
So what we found through
that economic impact study was that
every hundred million dollars
that is wasted on frivolous claims,
when you look at reinvesting
that into the economy, there's $140
million output
and that it amounts to about $55 million
in wages and over 600 jobs.
And we look at big projects
like the president wants to build,
Penn Station.
That's estimated to be $7 billion in cost.
If we were to put comparative negligence
on that project,
we can save over $500 million,
which is half $1 billion.
So just so we understand
the difference between comparative
negligence and absolute liability.
So if I'm a construction worker
working on a sky rise or something, and
I am not wearing my helmet and I fall off
a 60 story building, I would be dead.
But let's assume that I get injured.
Probably be dead.
If I would probably be done. All right.
Three story building. Yeah, okay.
One story.
Okay. But I'm not wearing my helmet.
Even though my employer says
I should be wearing a helmet,
and then I, you know, file a claim.
The absolutely liability rule
basically says
that you can't divide blame
between the company and the worker.
Is that right?
So instead of being 90% at fault
for my own injury
because I wasn't wearing a helmet
and I got a head injury,
the company is now 100% at fault.
That's absolutely right.
And in
other
states, they do comparative negligence.
And it's really driving up
the cost of insurance, so much
so that insurers don't even want
to write insurance in New York any more.
Contractors like Mike.
The market's limited.
You tell us about the insurance market
for you because this is a good thing
for us.
So I mean, there's zero purchasing power.
Contractors make a significant investment
in safety.
There's I promise
you, there's nothing more important
to the contracting community
than for every employee to go home
safe to their family, loved ones,
or whoever that may be.
At the end of the day,
I know everybody cares about that.
But when we go to renew our insurance
every year
and the large insurance carriers
look at what this, this market for them
is considered one
of the or the least favorable market
to right insurance,
so much so that carriers don't even want
to write insurance in this market anymore.
And if they do, deductibles are really
high.
Rates are really high.
So on a, on a percentage
basis of revenue, we're talking about,
you know, five, six, ten acts,
other states with much higher deductibles.
So now contractors carry the cost of those
deductible payouts in their bids,
which goes into these public works
bid numbers.
So that's where you exponentially
see the higher cost of construction.
But it actually take it a step further.
All the subcontractors and vendors
that are going to be working on our jobs
also have the same problem.
And typically
the subcontractors are smaller
contractors
by either volume or revenue or employees.
So they're typically paying
a higher premium on a percentage basis.
So those numbers are also baked
into our contract pricing.
So the owners.
Yeah our report
really when we say contractors in New York
or paying 10% of total construction
costs, insurance,
that's 500% more than other states,
where in other states it's only about 2%.
And then it Michael
mentioned the subconscious factor.
They get hit the worst on average.
If you are a concrete, subcontractor
or steel painting contractor,
you're paying 15
to 20% of your total volume of work,
and it's unsustainable.
So New York is the only city
or only state city state
that still has this law in place.
Is that right? Yes.
What happened in other states
when we saw it go away?
So the last state
to reform the so-called staff
scofflaw absolute liability
standard was Illinois in 1995.
So, this is 140 year old law.
It's antiquated. It's broken policy.
Even both the Democrats
and the Republicans,
when you speak to them one on one,
they know this is fail policy.
An interesting thing in Illinois.
Their safety,
the number of fatalities declined
after they put
a comparative negligence model.
So those that say it's, you know,
you have some,
trial lawyers, and they really
it is a catch count for the trial.
But, I mean.
That was going to be my next question.
So if everyone agrees
that this is an antiquated law,
who's actually standing in the way.
We're definitely going to get an email
after this episode.
And they're like,
your guests are totally biased.
There's going to be from some lawyer
and they're like, come on and do a follow
up, maybe, like,
but but this raises the question,
okay, the law has been around
for over 100 years.
So why now?
I mean, like I can understand that
that might raise. Yes.
Okay. New
York is going to be a higher cost state.
That doesn't explain the surge per se.
Has something changed in the last five,
ten, 28 years?
I mean, New
York used to do a lot more building
or used to build a lot
has something changed that the law
has more teeth or bites more than it did?
I mean, again, you talk about
the disappearance of certain insurance
carriers.
The law existed 50 years ago, right?
When I was first started my business.
Yeah, a little over 30 years ago.
You know, insurance was an add
on on the bid
where you didn't really focus about or day
about 1 or 2% of the contract price.
And that held true
maybe up until even ten years ago.
And in the last ten years, we've seen a
significant rise in the cost of insurance.
And I think it directly correlates
with frequency of claims,
third party
claims, payouts of those claims
and how either a judge or jury awards,
damages in those cases.
There's been well documented
cases of staged construction
accidents on sites.
What might I said is absolutely true
in New York for Scott, for lost,
the bodily injury
claim settlements for scaffolds
are six and a half times
the average of other claims settlements.
The sheer volume has
been increased by tenfold.
But we're talking about 15 years.
And that's why these insurers are leaving.
You know why now?
Why do we think
we have a real opportunity?
Not just because we have this
economic impact,
report that shows us exactly how much
we're spending because government leaders
are finally talking about the fraud
and abuse that's happening.
You know, our governor
and her state of the state, last month,
called on insurance reform
for the automobile industry.
Now we do half of the consumers in
the state are car owners, right?
They're driving they could relate to us
paying so much more,
but we're paying a 50% more in car
insurance compared to every other state.
But our contractors are paying 500% more.
And the governor touched upon
fraud and abuse, just like Mike said.
The governor says we need to address that.
We need to lower litigation
costs and mind you that these are auto
insurance claims that are much,
much less than scofflaw claims.
And we need to fix this.
We need reform.
So this is a step in the right direction.
And we're really focused
on reform in Washington right now.
There's movement there.
There's a lot of support on this big,
federal
infrastructure package
that's a part of a surface
reauthorization transit, bill
that gets reauthorized every five years.
It pays for big projects
like a Second Avenue subway
or major roads and highways, bridges.
And, it's a must pass, bill.
And we think that we'll see
reform there first.
And we're very hopeful
that reform will come a soon.
And Albany.
How would you actually go
about reducing litigation costs?
Because my assumption is as long
as you're doing like a jury process, it's
going to be pretty expensive
unless you go to something
like arbitration.
Yeah.
Well, you know, the, litigated costs,
one would say it goes to jury,
but all of these insurance
companies right now are just afraid
to get that far in New York State.
So they settle pretty quickly.
One insurance company,
Tradesman Insurance, they filed
five different
Rico cases in recent years, probably.
I've heard them
say that they invested over $16 million
to do personal investigations
to stop fraud and abuse.
And they they say that
because they were able to get so many
claims dropped by showing the fraud
that there were bad actors,
they saved over $2 billion.
And the numbers keep growing.
And one law firm,
Soobin associates, had like 3 to 300
different cases dropped, apparently,
closed their doors last month.
So it shouldn't get to that where
insurance companies have to do the reform.
This is bad public policy,
and we need our leaders in Washington
and Albany to do reform.
Now, it's
I mean, I think it's well documented.
It's all public information
of just one building or a couple buildings
where multiple claimants from the same
building with the same law firm
utilizing the same medical practices,
filing these lawsuits.
Yeah.
And some of the doctors
are losing their licenses and,
they're barred from workers comp cases.
And so that is reassuring
to see action happen.
And very we've
reaching a critical mass at this point.
So I think that's why,
now we're hopeful for reform.
Michael, can you talk a little bit
more about today versus mid 90s.
You get a you get a
you win a bid with the city or whatever.
You have a project.
Talk a little bit more about the process
of like you mentioned back then.
And insurance was an add on. Okay.
It was 1 or 2%.
That was 10%.
But setting aside the price, going out
and finding which carrier will take that,
can you just talk about
what life was like?
I don't know, again, 30 years ago
versus today
in terms of going out into the market
for finding that insurance
available options negotiations
and so forth.
Yeah, I mean, it was much easier
and much more simple 20, 30 years ago
than it is today. All right.
What did you do?
You talked to your insurance broker.
They would come back with 3 or 4 quotes
all roughly the same.
Would you feel comfortable with
you would do your annual renewals
that would be incremental
to a cost of living inflationary
adjustments to your annual rate.
You signed on again for another year.
Now it's a much more detailed,
thorough process, thorough review.
How much are you going
to raise your deductibles?
Where back
then, deductibles might have been $25,000.
I mean, I think we're at 750,
500 or 750,000 now per occurrence.
I mean, significant, insignificant changes
where now
the insurance company will dictate
when you're going through your quotes.
If you don't raise your deductible,
we won't even write your insurance.
Where that didn't happen back then.
So there was much more purchasing power
in the contracting
community 20, 30 years ago
in the marketplace than there is today.
Yeah, this is what I wanted to ask.
So if the scaffolding law goes away,
are you confident
that new insurance actors
would actually come into the market?
Because it feels like part of the problem
here is a lot of people have accidents,
so you have limited insurers
to actually choose from, which means
they now have all the pricing power.
Yeah,
I think the free market will work itself.
It's, competitive market right now for the
limited that do do business in New York.
I was just on the phone earlier today
with Zurich, which is a worldwide
insurer, and,
they stopped insuring small contractors,
and they'll only do big wrap up
projects in New York State.
Our Department of Financial Services,
regulates the companies
to make sure that they can't charge
too much or too little.
And again, it's the market.
As long
as they can prove they can make money here
in New York, they'll come back.
It just dawned on me,
you know, one of the thing to consider,
which sometimes is good for the local
contracting community.
Yeah, but also not necessarily good
for the overall city of New York.
There were contractors based
in other states that won't work here,
because their insurance companies
will exclude
their policy from working in New York,
and then they would have to buy
job specific or site specific policies,
which are also very uncompetitive rates.
So it's easier for them
just to stay out of the marketplace
that then, in theory,
may drive down competition right from
no cause did analysis.
I think and interesting, you know, to
bring it back to what the governor has,
taken on in her state of the state
or her in her budget, auto insurance.
You know, we mentioned the trial lawyers
and how this is really a cash
cow for them.
But, you know, they like to paint
the insurance companies as the bad actors.
But we look in places
like, Florida, for example,
they had a similar no fault auto insurance
policy like New York currently has.
And, they changed the policies there
and they've given rate
payers, double digit, refunds.
So there is this a situation, a scenario
where we could see
the same for our contractors.
If real reform happens here in New York.
Just to be clear,
does the high cost of insurance
also apply to projects where heights
presumably don't come into it very much?
So, you know,
if you're building a new subway
tunnel or something like that,
I assume there's
there's
probably some scaffolding involved.
But like,
maybe you're not following too much.
You could be standing on a ladder
in a sewer
trench, six inches up on the ladder
with the ladder secured
on the bottom of the hole tied up,
all in conformance with OSHA regulations.
And if the employee falls
six inches to the ground,
which
typically we all think we would be okay
falling six inches.
But then some injury arises months later
and ends up in a lawyer's desk.
And, contractors then sued.
There'll be some sort of payout and
that would fall under the scaffold law.
So even though you're not up
on the heights of a building, not building
a superstructure, that law still applies.
So I find this argument
to be very compelling.
And, the, the, high cost of insurance
on a per project basis in New York City
versus every other state, that seems like
an issue with, unquestionably.
All that being said,
some of the numbers you read about
construction process is, okay.
Let's say we take only 30% for labor
or third labor
or 30% of the job, and then let's say
insurance is 10% of the job.
So if there's other part
and when I, you know,
when you read
about the cost of an elevator in a subway,
it seems like even if we like knocked off
of a lot of it for insurance
and labor, whatever, it still seems crazy
expensive in New York.
So could we just talk about, like,
are these numbers real?
Like when we see, like, oh, cost $60
million to build an elevator somewhere?
Is that is that is that real
or is that clickbait?
What's going on there?
I mean, I don't know where it costs
60 million to, to build an elevator,
but look, remember, there are subsurface
conditions in New York
that you have to deal
with, like relocating
utilities and gas mains and steam
mains and electric.
That all may go into the cost of that
elevator, but it's really not the direct
cost of the elevator.
So like when the MTA goes
and puts a new elevator in on a corner.
Yeah.
Yes. Maybe the cost
of that elevator project sounds enormous.
And it is for the elevator project,
but not all of it is directly tied to the.
But it's clearing away.
Other cities have this too, right?
Like, I mean, yeah, absolutely.
It's not all
there's going to be real estate
acquisition costs
and all the issues of materials
and everything.
But I get the impression that like
building an elevator in New York City,
like, should taxpayers be happy
with, like, the numbers that they seem
very high and they seem out of proportion
with what we see in other cities?
Yeah. I don't know the comparative data.
Okay. Yeah.
We are most expensive
to build in comparison
to other cities like San Francisco. Yeah.
But it's still very expensive
to build there, too.
Sure.
So what are we paying for? Like what?
What are these number?
I mean, again,
let's go back to the turf example.
Yeah. No million dollars
for like turf on let's say.
And you did.
And I left before when you mentioned the,
the skyscraper, the Chrysler Building
and the Bethlehem Steel and how that was
probably put together in less than a year,
the Empire State Building.
And today we're building
mega towers that were taken 3 or 4 years.
And, while they're important projects
and they're very expensive projects,
we were able to do it, in such a shorter
time frame back then.
Of course, you save money
when you reduce the time back to that.
Track.
It was in Juniper Park, and it's funny
that you mention that, but actually,
I realized after you spoke
about Battery Park and how,
you know, that it was water before
we, expanded,
that was a swampland
once in Queens, that particular park.
And so those are
the constraints that we don't think about
when we're building in New York.
It's so hard to find schools,
you know, places to build schools.
I remember as a council member just having
the most overcrowded school district
and so many sites were contaminated
and we couldn't find a good sign.
You know, it's just these difficult things
that happen in such a dense city.
And it's part of the reason it's
so expensive to build here.
Does anyone have any good examples
of building like, efficiently
at not so much cost, relatively,
in New York City or New York State speak,
but still to a high standard,
like an example of a project
that was done really well.
Michael, surely
you should be naming some of your own.
Yeah.
No, I mean, we we don't have unless you're
a major design flaws or errors.
I feel like almost all of our projects
do go extremely well.
Right. It's a competitive marketplace.
We're the low bidder.
Right.
Typically when you get the job
which means we're the cheapest price
lowest responsible bidder.
And more often than not
we don't have these major.
You know overall ones or changes.
They seem to go fairly well.
And, Michael introduced himself
as the president of the company is.
But me and Michael worked together on,
the mayor's task force for capital reform,
and we went up to Albany
as part of the reforms two years ago
and pushed for progressive design bills
or different ways, of building
projects, that New York didn't use
and other states used.
And that actually decreased the timeline.
And, you were able to build, for less
by using these delivery methods.
And I think that, Shirley Chisholm Park,
they just.
Mayor mommy cut the ribbon.
But DDC is pointing to that project
as coming in under budget.
And, you know,
and in, in a short amount of time
that was estimated
that it would take to build.
So there are ways we can work together,
putting our minds together.
To bring about real reform.
I think one area that we didn't touch on,
which I think is important, I know you
probably know the statistics, right.
If you if you look at the counterargument,
like if you said the trial lawyers
sure to to what's driving
these insurance costs, you would think
if these stricter rules
and laws are in place,
it would make everything much safer
or safer for the worker or less injuries.
And do you want to. Yeah. I mean, look.
There's
nothing more important than safety.
That's the cornerstone of the
work that our contractors do.
You know, they want their workers
to go home as safe as they were
when they came to work that day.
We're, you know, even,
focusing on culture on the job
site and total wellness,
you know, that's that's important.
So we need to continue to be forward
thinking, and.
But the data, the data set,
the results in New York
are equal to other states.
On in terms of our rate of fatalities.
In fact, New York has higher
rate of fatalities despite this law
in comparison to state like new Jersey
or the average in the country.
You know, when we have nearly 12
injuries, fatalities per 100,000,
workers,
whereas the national average is under ten.
And so we're 20% higher in New York,
despite
having such a strict liability
on contractors.
Can we talk a little bit
about current conditions.
So one of the things that we heard
a lot in like 2021, 2022, 23, there's like
intense scarcity of skilled tradesmen,
in various things, electrical, etc..
How is that?
Is that still a big is that a big issue,
still a major constraint right
now, finding available labor.
I think an aging workforce at least.
I mean, without me
having any demographic data,
just like visual context
and we do have an aging workforce,
I don't think the younger generations
are so inclined
to, either go to a vocational school
or some type of trade school.
I would sit here and I would tell anyone.
I think it would be a great industry
with the disruption
going on in the world right now.
Yeah.
With, you know, the advent of AI
and on all these.
Jobs for like for you, like, right now,
is this like when you think of the various
headaches that you have in
your life is keeping a sort of steady
the available flow of labor
that knows how to build things,
like one of the things that keeps you up.
At night. Yeah.
I mean, available flow of labor
is one of the things
that's kept me up at night
since I started my business.
Okay, we converted to, 100% employee
owned company a couple of years ago.
So much
so that I included the trades people.
So the collectively bargained employees
through the different
unions in the city are part of that Esop.
That's very unusual.
And I applaud Michael
and his team for doing that.
But when it
when we think about, workforce
needs, many of our contractors
that are doing the infrastructure work,
like Michael, are experiencing,
difficulties
and often take talent from one another.
So Esop is going to stop that for sure.
But, when you look at the commercial,
buildings that are going up,
which is more of a private market,
or residential, that is not happening.
And we really didn't have a chance
to talk much about affordable housing,
but, that, any of that building is
much more likely to be nonunion today,
which is a real shame,
because a lot of times those workers
are not getting paid on the books.
More likely,
80% of the injuries that happen on
job sites are happening
on nonunion job sites.
So we really want to prevent
that and help promote, union employment
as much as possible.
Michael, you mentioned AI.
So now I have to ask,
you know, we we dug in a little bit
into construction productivity
at the beginning of this conversation.
And, you know,
I think construction is largely done
now as it was
probably like 20 or 30 years ago.
And there have been some
technological advances, like the nail gun.
But beyond that,
we don't have actual robots
that are like putting shingles
on our houses and things like that.
But how confident are you that it's
going to actually stay that way forever?
Because I mean, Lem's ChatGPT
kind of like.
How you're looking at me,
like going to like vibe code.
I'm going to vibe code or. A running joke.
It's all Joe's fault.
But it came out of nowhere
for White Collar workers.
Could it come out of nowhere
for, blue collar?
I think so.
And look, I don't think it's
going to replace the workforce.
I actually was
at a construction conference,
a couple of weeks ago.
And my biggest takeaway is
AI is in replacing employees.
But employees who use AI will
replace the employees who aren't.
Do you see that? Like,
like are there in your firm?
Are you getting value from it?
Is anyone doing anything
with like tech or anything?
So is anyone using it for drawing?
We at our offsite strategy session
last week
and one of our quarterly priorities,
yeah, is all around
implementing artificial intelligence
in our processes and workflows.
So really,
how can we get information sooner.
Yeah.
So instead of relying on maybe
these incumbent software models, taking
the data we have and using AI to give us
analysis of that data much quicker.
So not so much the physical process
of like putting up drywall,
but the planning and what that's coming.
I mean, I have friends who have robots
that can tie rebars now with wire, right?
They've invested in these companies.
I'm I'm not utilizing those robots yet,
but they're out there.
Caterpillar has technology.
The the heavy equipment manufacturer
where someone can sit, let's call
it like well, we grew up with a video game
like, it looks like, pole position.
And if you, if, if I'm dating myself
and you can operate four
different machines, not at the same time,
but from one TV screen
for actual caterpillar machines
at four different locations,
just sitting in, like what
I would call an arcade machine. Wow.
No. Operator in the seat.
Yeah.
Interestingly enough, you know,
I mentioned Zurich earlier is Zurich
Insurance will only, insure a project
in New York if there are cameras watching.
Now, they use AI after a day's work
to study any movement that was dangerous.
So it's not just like people,
you know, believe.
It's for surveillance
to stop fraud and abuse from happening
was really to correct workers
to and reduce risk.
And they've seen that there, incidents
have gone down significantly.
And, their job sites are much more safer.
I'm part of a tri venture,
group doing the East Coast
resiliency project on the Lower East Side.
It's $1.3 billion project, and we're
utilizing that exact system.
The cameras are located
on machines, on poles,
and the data gets downloaded
every night analyzed by AI.
So not only do we get,
like near misses or data,
but we also use it
for training the workforce.
So the videos that it captures
to make the job site safer.
Yeah.
What about again,
just so about current conditions.
What about materials cost?
So we know that the cost of everything
surged a lot,
you know, immediately
in the wake of the pandemic.
You getting any relief?
Have the pace of price increases gone?
Slowed it all?
Are there any parts we've talked about,
like transformers, like various key
electrical parts
that you can't get easily at any price?
What are you seeing right now
on just acquisition of materials?
Yeah, I have not seen prices come down.
Okay.
I've you know, it's no different
when there was like a fuel surcharge right
at the oil market spiked and every vendor
would put a fuel surcharge on deliveries.
Somehow
those fuel surcharges never go away.
What about
those are like just other raw materials,
like other things that are in
like scarcity that you like, have
a difficult time
finding at all at any price
right now?
No, I think we're
pretty much getting everything we need.
I know Covid and coming up
there was big issues.
When you walk into a building
like the Bloomberg offices,
do you look around and you think like,
what a marvel of structural engineering?
Or do you think,
I wonder what the insurance costs are now?
I'm thinking I should have done
something different in my career.
You know, one
that one less thing that you mentioned.
And I've read people who like,
talk about like, you know, abundance, etc.
they talk about how a lot of like, public
projects, there's a big
consultant element that many aspects of it
have been outsourced
from the public sector that these
third parties and that that drives up.
You mentioned concerns.
Does that, does that resonate with you
in terms of where you see
potential cost bloat and so forth?
Yeah, I mean, I don't know the value
of the consultant contracts.
I can tell you based on my experience,
we used to work on a lot more contracts
that were run in-house by the agencies.
Yeah.
And now you see a lot of third party,
like resident engineer and inspection
services
and other tests
that used to be performed in-house
that are now performed
by third party consultants.
And they're often
they're called owner's reps.
And we'll get complaints
from our contractors
that owners reps are delaying the project.
So they continue
to get paid for the project.
And that's saying something where we're
interested in seeing some reform too.
I've heard of
that are more than one type of project.
It could you know, it could be a school
being built or, a bridge being painted.
Michael.
Elizabeth, thank you so much for coming
on. I'd love those. A lot of fun.
Thank you.
Yeah, I think thanks for having us.
That was great. Thank you.
Thank you for having us. Thanks.
Appreciate it.
Yeah, that was super interesting.
It was great. Tracy.
That was a fun conversation I like it
felt like a re learned about the city
in some way. You know what I'm saying?
I learned a lot about absolute liability.
Yeah. Absolute liability. Is interesting.
Look I also think part of this
I mean I the point about
delays is very striking to me
because again, that that would seem to be
an issue where you're still paying people
to build something,
but building it is taking ten years
instead of five years.
Yeah.
Especially at a time when interest rates
are higher because they compound extra.
Right.
And also, it seems like there's
a potential problem of incentives
here, right?
Like if I am a consultant working
on a project and I am still getting paid,
the project's not actually going
and I can spend a lot of time,
I don't know, pointing out
like individual issues and potentially
delaying stuff
like that's an incentive problem.
Yeah. No, absolutely.
I guess I would say I find the point
about insurance to be compelling
and the point about like,
if 49 other states
have gotten rid of these laws
and they're not actually even
making New York a safer workplace.
I mean, it'd be one thing,
I guess, if, like,
New York had, like half the accident.
Yeah, is the rest of the country.
And then you say, okay, well, look like
you could point to a law like this
and say, this is clearly making causing
everyone to take safety more seriously.
If you can't point to that and
if every other state has gotten rid of it,
I mean, I don't have any opinion, but
and I again,
I'm sure we're going to hear from lawyers.
About to get make an enemy fire.
Yeah,
we're going to get emails from lawyers
saying we want to do a rebuttal episode,
but I my gut is that there's probably
some definitely something to that.
Well, the other thing I was thinking about
on the insurance point is, you know,
I have this pet theory that,
like, insurers basically run the world.
Yeah. I mean, they control a lot of money.
They set, like not just safety standards,
but social standards for a lot of things.
It's really interesting
hearing about using AI to monitor.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
The security camera footage
like for health and safety
because I can imagine, you know,
if that helps the insurers,
I can imagine them asking that
to become standard practice everywhere.
It's super interesting to think like,
okay, yeah,
you want to have cameras
because if there's an accident,
then you could go back
and review the footage.
But this idea that like,
oh, you could like see if there was a near
miss or something like that, the
AI can detect it directly, potentially.
That's interesting.
And then of course, there's
going to be all these questions
about surveillance
and whether people like that. But this is,
this is
going to be there's going to be big topic.
Yeah. No, it's all it's going to
come on very fast.
I know I keep saying this,
but we really should do more on insurers.
We'll figure out
we're starting. To do more.
You know, like if we keep saying it
like we are, you know.
No. Yes.
But even more.
But even more I agree, I agree.
Should we leave it there. Yeah.
Let's let's leave it there.
