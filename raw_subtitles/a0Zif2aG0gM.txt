We spend great effort
into trying to capture moments.
Freeze-frame memories,
drawings, paintings, sculptures,
photography and home movies
are all our attempts
to remember something after it's gone.
But did you know that your brain and eyes
are already hardwired to do this?
I'm not talking about memory.
I'm talking about the fact
that your eye continues to see an object
for a split second
after that object disappears.
I've been thinking about that fact
for over 35 years.
(Video) Hi, I’m Brian McLean, and I’m
doing my science fair project on
the principle of persistence of vision.
Many of you are probably
wondering what is persistence of vision?
Well, it's really pretty neat.
Your eye is an amazing organ,
but it has one little quirk.
It continues to see an object
for a 10th of a second
after the object disappears.
Here's an example.
This principle is what makes movies,
cartoons and even TV possible.
Can't believe the sweater still fits.
(Laughter)
Brian McLean: Yep, that was me,
12 years old and going deep
into the science of animation.
I didn't want to do
my science fair project
on the principle of persistence of vision.
I was forced to.
I wanted to do my science fair
project on claymation,
but my dad, he wouldn't let me.
He said, "Brian, this is a science fair.
If you want to do claymation,
you have to focus on the science
that makes animation possible."
So I opened up my collection
of encyclopedias and I got to work.
It was here that I learned
about this strange optical phenomenon
called the principle
of persistence of vision.
Of course, our brains
play a huge role in this.
It's not just the quirk in the retina
that allow us to see film and animation.
Our brains are hardwired
to be imaginative,
to take in reality,
in this case a series of still images,
and create something new and innovative
out of what it was given.
But when I was in sixth grade,
I wasn't thinking of any of that.
I just loved stop-motion animation.
King Kong, Rudolph the Red-Nose reindeer,
scenes from "Star Wars,"
"Nightmare Before Christmas"
and Wallace and Gromit.
I spent my childhood wondering
what types of tools these filmmakers use
to create movie magic.
Artists, technicians,
cinematographers and animators
were creating groundbreaking visuals
using primitive tools
compared to today's standards.
Audiences leaving the theaters
wondering how the heck
those geniuses pulled it off.
That was me.
So I went to school to study art.
When I graduated college in 1999,
I barely knew how to write an email.
Computers were not something
I was comfortable with, so I resisted.
Like many artists,
I bounced from job to job.
My career path was not a straight line.
Eventually, I ended up at a design school
running their model shop.
It was here the trajectory
of my life changed.
I was introduced to a 3D printer.
This amazing tool
was like science fiction.
It bridged the digital world
and the physical worlds together.
And for me, it made the digital
world far less intimidating
and more approachable.
So I'd read the instruction
manual at night
and teach the students
how to use it during the day.
I realized then that creativity
isn't just about making things,
it's also about reinventing
how we make them.
So a 3D printer isn't as unusual
as it was 20 years ago.
But the potential impacts are enormous.
Humans love to work with our hands.
For thousands of years, everything
we made was handcrafted and unique.
More recently, we've drifted
towards making lots and lots of things.
Now, as we mass produce these objects,
each object needed
to be the same by design.
Innovation has built
assembly lines and tools
that can pump out
thousands of widgets a day,
precise but all the same.
With a 3D printer,
it takes a three-dimensional object
and slices it into hundreds,
if not thousands,
of two-dimensional images.
Kind of like a CAT scan.
And then those images
are built up layer by layer.
A polyjet printer sprays down liquid resin
and a bright UV light goes
and cures that resin.
It’s a lot like your inkjet
printer at your house.
Imagine printing the letter A
on a piece of paper
and jetting down the A
in the exact same spot.
And between each pass of the printer head,
imagine dropping the paper slightly.
Eventually you're going
to end up with an extruded A.
Now, just like your inkjet
printer at your house,
it doesn't take any longer
to print a paragraph of Shakespeare
or a rudimentary sentence.
The detail of what you're printing
doesn't necessarily add more time.
We’re so used to the equation:
the more detail,
the more complexity to something,
the longer it takes to make.
But with a 3D printer,
you can utilize the speed
of a mass-produced object,
but each object can be unique,
have their own bespoke
design and personality.
And they were about
to have a fundamental impact
on the way that stop-motion
movies are made.
(Music)
(Yawns)
Starting in 2006,
working with a small team
at a fledgling animation studio
outside of Portland, Oregon,
called LAIKA,
we pioneered the use of using 3D printers
for stop-motion animation
to produce replacement animation.
Our novel idea
was to take this 100-year-old technique
of replacement animation,
and fuse it with 21st-century
3D printing technology.
We'd harness the power and subtlety
of the computer animation,
but instead of rendering out a model
like Pixar or Dreamworks would,
we would send face geometry
to a 3D printer
and then have it become a physical object
that would snap onto a stop-motion puppet.
"Coraline" was the first film
to have 3D-printed faces.
Over the course of the next
18 years and six films,
LAIKA’s continued to pioneer
what stop-motion is capable of,
as well as really redefining
what's capable
in the 3D printing industry.
(Video)
(Water bubbling)
Character: Awesome.
BM: At first, we started printing
faces out of a single material
and we had to hand-paint things.
But then for our next few films,
we started using color printing.
Now, color printing was different
than the resin printing we'd used before.
Here, colored glue is sprayed down
onto white powder.
Now, the science behind
this printer is the absorption rate
between the liquid and the dry powder.
Together, they came together to create
the geometry as well as the mixed color.
Now the problem is we live
in Portland, Oregon.
I don't know if you guys noticed,
but it tends to rain a little bit here.
So what that means if we printed
a face in the summer
and that exact same face in the winter,
they would come out
different sizes and different colors
because of the humidity differences.
But it was the only
color printer on the market.
So for years we made do.
Now we'd also design and engineer
the entire head in the computer.
Computer modelers wore many hats.
They were first the sculptor
that was sculpting
the outside of the face,
and then they would switch gears
and become the engineer
to engineer all the inner components.
We refer to these as very fancy
Mr. Potato Heads.
(Laughter)
Now, starting in 2016,
something really exciting
happened in the 3D printing world.
I don't know if any of you guys heard,
but man, us 3D printing nerds were stoked.
Are you ready for this?
Voxel printing.
You've all heard -- thanks.
(Laughter)
You've all heard of pixels, right?
The little 2D dots
that make up 2D imagery.
Well, a voxel is basically
a three-dimensional pixel.
A voxel is tiny.
There's something like
338 million voxels in a cubic inch.
So unlike the inkjet printing
we'd used before
that were based on decades
of 2D inkjet technology,
where colors can overlap to mix color,
voxels cannot mix.
Each voxel has to occupy its own 3D space.
The printer jets down distinct voxels
of cyan, yellow, magenta,
black, white, and clear resin
layer by layer in different patterns.
Now, because we're printing
a three-dimensional object,
the shape of that object,
and the way that light hits the surface
and is either reflected off
or absorbed in,
affects the colors our eyes see.
So what that means is the pattern
of voxels of magenta and yellow
to print an orange sphere
are different than that of an orange cube.
If you were to take one of our faces
and look at it under
an electron microscope,
you would not see smooth mixed color,
but instead millions and millions
of distinct voxels.
It's a lot like a pointillist painting.
If you stand back far enough,
it appears as though the colors are mixed.
But when you get close to the canvas,
you can see the individual colors.
This was groundbreaking
in the 3D-printing world.
Not only could you create
sophisticated color parts,
but you could start to control
the interior as well.
Remember, there are voxels
throughout the entire volume,
not just on the surface.
By leveraging visual effects
software packages typically used
in big-budget movies to render
explosions, tornadoes,
or raging oceans,
LAIKA has been taking
super-dense point cloud data
and transferring them
into 3D printed voxels
and being able to precisely control
voxels in a 3D space.
We're at the tip of the innovation
sphere in this area.
We can take hard materials
and soft materials
and combine them on a voxel level,
producing a brand new material
with unique properties in the process.
Anyone wondering what this is over here,
this ominous object under the black cloth?
Well, remember how a 3D object
is built up out of layers?
Well, it turns out you
can take the CAT scan data,
and you can 3D print a perfect replica
of a patient's body part.
By taking voxels, you can create materials
that are like bone, tissue,
muscle veins, and skin.
A surgeon can take real patient data
and 3D print a perfect replica
of a patient's head
with the exact placement of their tumor,
and then do a practice operation
removing that tumor.
(Applause)
LAIKA’s very own Rob Ducey,
who was part of that
original team in 2006,
has helped write a research paper,
along with Nick Jacobson
and other researchers
in the medical field on this very subject.
It's amazing to see
LAIKA Animation Studios,
alongside other prestigious
medical researchers,
as the one pioneering the use
of voxel printing in the medical field.
But we're like any other user
in the 3D-printing world.
Yes, we've won a scientific
and technical Oscar
for pioneering the use of 3D printing
in stop-motion animation,
but most other users
are creating prototypes.
We’re using a 3D printer
as a creative expression.
In a way, bringing still objects to life.
Each face we print is unique.
Each one is a work of art
that's hand-finished by artists.
For our latest film, "Missing Link,"
we printed over 106,000 unique faces.
We have a face library
run by face librarians
who catalog and archive
each individual expression.
We've also won a Guinness
Book of World Records
for the most number of 3D-printed faces
in a stop-motion animated film.
(Laughter)
I don't think anyone else
is competing in that category,
but it's still pretty cool.
(Laughter)
So the geniuses at LAIKA have been
trying to figure out a way,
in real time,
that I could demonstrate how we use
3D printers for replacement animation.
You see, stop-motion animation
is an extremely slow process.
The average animator,
working 40 hours a week,
can produce three to four
seconds of footage.
I would be up on this stage for weeks
trying to animate something for you guys,
and if any of you stuck around that long,
you'd be disappointed
because I'm not an animator
and it wouldn't look very good.
(Laughter)
So at first we thought
about building one of these.
This is called a zoetrope.
It was invented
before film cameras existed
as a way to see still images come to life.
We thought about dragging
one of these out here
and having me spin it like crazy,
but the problem with this design
is all the beautiful artwork is hidden
behind those large cylindrical walls.
So instead,
we designed, engineered and built
something specific for this TEDx stage.
(Applause)
So this is Norman.
He's one of our typical
stop-motion puppets.
Norman is about ten inches tall.
He's got a metal armature.
Animators will move the puppet,
and they will also remove his face.
This is one of those 3D-printed faces.
There are magnets on the back,
and the magnets snap
the face into position.
So when an animator goes out to set,
they go out with their little
character, the little puppet,
but they also go out with a box of faces.
We're delivering 24 faces
for every second of footage.
This represents three seconds
of Norman animation.
Think about this contraption,
this camera as your eyeball
and this flywheel mechanism
as your eyelid.
As I move slowly,
it's like you're blinking slowly.
As I move backwards --
I can move forward and backwards.
Now, you can also kind of probably
hear some sounds, right?
Those are broken up sounds of words.
As I move faster, it's like
you're blinking faster, right?
Now, let me get this set up.
Once I hit the magical speed
of 24 frames a second,
your mind's imagination
will fill in the gaps,
and you'll be left with
the beautiful and creative world
coming to life before your eyes.
Alright, so this is 16 feet long,
and I've got to get over there
in about two seconds.
I've had to get in shape for this part.
They didn't tell me that
when they built this thing.
Are you guys ready?
Audience: Yes!
(Cheers)
Norman: Hi. Nice to see you guys.
(Applause and cheers)
BM: Alright, one more time.
That was pretty cool.
Faster, slower?
Audience: Faster!
BM: Oh, I was afraid
you were going to say that.
Alright, can we dim the lights?
Here we go.
Norman: Hi. Nice to see you guys.
(Cheers and applause)
BM: That kid you saw before in the video
loves stop-motion animation.
That led me down a path
of first discovery,
then resisting something
I feared: technology.
The artistic drive of the individuals
that I have an honor of working alongside
have built an environment
where we get to bring
imagination into reality
and forge the path forward
of not only inventing new things,
but using creativity to reinvent
how we make them.
(Video) Mr Pickles: Mmm.
Mr Trout: Just keeping
the streets clean.
Mr Pickles: Free from evil.
Mr Trout: Yeah.
Mr Pickles: You ever think
about the universe, Mr Trout?
What if our world is just
like a tiny speck.
Mr Trout: A tiny little speck.
Mr Pickles: And there are giants
looking down on us?
Mr Trout: And every time we move --
Mr Pickles: It's actually them moving us.
Mr Trout: Seems a bit tedious.
Mr Pickles: Like that,
just there, me blinking.
That would have taken them a day.
Mr Trout: Me moving my arm, 500 men.
Mr Pickles: I mean,
none of them are going home.
They're having to do this bit.
And now this bit.
And this bit.
I mean, this should stop.
BM: Thank you very much.
(Applause)
