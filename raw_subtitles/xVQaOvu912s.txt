>> So,
 here's
 why
 I'm
 so
 confused
 right


now.
 Like,
 if
 someone
 said
 to
 me,


>> just
 one
 reason.


>> If
 someone
 said
 to
 me,
 look,
 you
 know,


the
 economy
 is
 slowing
 down.
 Clearly,


job
 creation
 is
 in
 the
 tank.
 It's


decelerating.
 Housing
 is
 in
 the
 tank,


etc.
 There's
 a
 bunch
 of
 sectors
 that
 are


soft.
 We
 need
 rate
 cuts.
 Okay,
 that


sounds
 good.
 Inflation
 has
 come
 down


quite
 a
 bit
 from
 where
 it
 was.
 But
 it's


still
 elevated.
 And
 then
 if
 someone


said,
 "Look,
 the
 stock
 market
 is
 at


record
 highs.
 PPI
 just
 came
 in
 super


hot.
 Inflation
 is
 still
 above
 levels,


etc.
 Are
 you
 insane
 to
 even
 be
 talking


about
 rate
 cuts?"
 I'd
 be
 like, "Oh,


yeah,
 okay,
 that
 makes
 sense,
 too."


Like,
 I
 find
 many
 kinds
 of
 arguments
 to


be
 very
 persuasive
 right
 here.
 I
 don't


have a
 strong
 views.


>> I'm
 not
 what
 one
 for
 hyperbole.
 I
 try


not
 to
 be,
 right?
 I
 try
 to
 be
 a
 good


journalist
 in
 that
 sense.
 But
 I
 would


honestly
 say
 like
 this
 is
 one
 of
 the


most
 difficult
 macro
 environments
 to


call
 in
 probably
 my
 professional
 career


which
 is


>> longer
 than
 I
 would
 necessarily
 like
 it


to
 be
 at
 this
 point.
 But
 as
 you
 said
 if


you
 look
 at
 the
 stock
 market
 which
 feeds


into
 financial
 conditions
 right
 look
 at


financial
 conditions
 like
 financial


conditions
 do
 not
 look
 that
 restrictive


at
 the
 moment
 and
 yet
 you
 do
 have
 people


who
 say
 that
 actually
 we
 are
 still
 in


restrictive
 territory
 and
 and
 the
 labor


market
 is
 weakening
 as
 you
 said
 and
 so


we
 need
 a
 rate
 cut.
 So
 we
 have
 this
 one


body
 of
 people
 who
 are
 talking
 about
 a


potential
 Fed
 policy
 error
 and
 then
 we


have
 another
 body
 of
 people
 including


people
 from
 the
 Trump
 administration
 who


are
 talking
 about
 the
 need
 to
 do
 a
 50


basis
 point.


>> It
 totally
 you
 could
 make
 the
 argument


that
 the
 Fed
 is
 either
 committing
 a


policy
 error
 now
 or
 contemplating
 a


policy
 error.
 Then
 there's
 this
 whole


dynamic
 with
 the
 fact
 that
 we
 know
 that


there's
 this
 one
 incredible
 thing
 going


on
 which
 is
 all
 the
 AI
 spending
 and
 how


that
 actually
 intersects
 with
 macro
 is


very
 confusing.
 So,
 and
 we
 have
 Jackson


Hole
 next
 week,
 which
 we're
 gonna
 be
 at.


>> I'm
 excited
 about
 Jackson
 Hole.
 So,
 the


scuttlebutt
 for
 journalists
 going
 to


Jackson
 Hole
 is
 that
 apparently
 like
 the


rooms
 are
 in
 even
 higher
 demand
 than


normal
 because
 behind
 all
 the
 macro


debate,
 which
 we
 just
 laid
 out,
 there's


also
 the
 question
 of
 Fed
 independence,


right?
 So,
 interest
 in
 Jackson
 Hole
 is


like
 higher
 than
 it's
 ever
 been.


>> It's
 going
 to
 be
 a
 big
 Jackson
 Hole.


Whatever
 the
 formal
 theme
 of
 the


conference
 is
 going
 to
 be,
 you
 know,


there's
 going
 to
 be
 some
 academic
 theme


coming
 up.
 Whatever
 that
 is,
 that's
 not


going
 to
 be
 the
 theme.
 The
 theme
 is


going
 to
 be
 all
 of
 the
 talk
 about
 Fed


independence.


>> I
 did
 a
 dead
 list.


>> I
 am
 both
 the
 most
 popular
 trader
 and


most
 successful
 trader
 at
 Citadel.


>> Fed
 is
 going
 viral.


>> Uh,
 barges.


>> This
 is
 an
 after
 school
 special
 except


>> I've
 decided
 I'm
 going
 to
 base
 my
 entire


personality
 going
 forward
 on
 campaigning


for
 a
 strategic
 pork
 reserve
 in
 the
 US.


>> Black
 gold.
 These
 are
 the
 the
 important


questions.
 Is
 it
 robots
 taking
 over
 the


world?


>> No,
 I
 think
 that
 like
 in
 a
 couple
 years


the
 AI
 will
 do
 a
 really
 good
 job
 of


making
 the
 Outlaws
 podcast.
 One
 day
 that


person
 will
 have
 the
 mandate
 of
 heaven.


>> How
 do
 I
 get
 more
 popular
 and


successful?


>> We
 do
 have


>> the
 perfect
 guest.


>> You're
 listening
 to
 lots
 more
 where
 we


catch
 up
 with
 friends
 about
 what's
 going


on
 right
 now.


>> Because
 even
 when
 OddLots
 is
 over,


there's
 always
 lots
 more.


>> And
 we
 really
 do
 have
 the
 perfect
 guest.


Scanda,
 nice
 to
 have
 you
 here
 in
 our
 uh


>> When
 Joe's
 confused,
 you're
 the
 guy
 we


turn
 to.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 Let's
 start.


Actually,
 just
 quick
 take.
 Uh
 we're


recording
 this
 9:04
 August
 14th
 about
 30


minutes
 ago.
 We
 got
 that
 really
 hot
 PPI


report,
 but
 also
 I
 don't
 know
 what
 that


means.
 Like
 is
 it
 a
 big
 deal?
 What
 does


it
 say?
 What's
 going
 on
 there?
 Is
 it


What
 does
 it
 mean
 for
 PCE?
 Is
 it
 means


that
 margins
 are
 going to
 be
 crimped?


What's
 going
 on
 there?
 I
 mean
 I
 think


for
 PPI
 today
 should
 be
 seen
 as
 at
 least


showing
 the
 inflationary
 side
 of
 the


story
 is
 still
 there.
 Okay.


>> Not
 just
 in
 terms
 of
 like
 some
 of the


aggregates
 may
 be
 distorted
 for
 a
 lot
 of


reasons
 but
 what
 matters
 for
 the
 Fed's


inflation
 gauges
 got
 moved
 up
 a
 bit.
 So


what
 you're
 going
 to
 be
 tracking
 for


inflation
 for
 July
 CPI
 and
 PPI
 both


matter
 and
 so
 that's
 going
 to
 be
 moved


up
 a
 bit.


>> So
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 running
 at
 roughly


2.9%
 on
 core
 PCE.
 That's
 when
 it
 is


actually
 substantially


>> we
 we
 we
 are
 higher
 now
 than
 we
 were


last
 year.


>> So
 it's
 like
 it's
 it's
 starting
 to
 look


like
 the
 progress
 is
 starting
 to
 turn


the
 other
 direction.
 Now
 there
 may
 be


some
 reasons
 why
 it
 is
 transitory
 this


time
 that
 it
 is
 temporary
 and
 yet
 it


doesn't
 really
 feel
 great
 and
 I
 imagine


for
 chair
 Powell
 there's
 a
 feeling
 of


wait
 I
 remember
 in
 2021
 in
 August
 I
 was


pretty
 confident
 that
 this
 was
 going
 to


be
 shortterm
 and
 then
 we
 saw
 some


increases
 and
 I
 said
 well
 we
 got
 to


focus
 on
 getting
 the
 labor
 market
 back


first


>> and
 then
 people
 kind
 of
 have
 held
 that


against
 him
 accordingly
 but
 now
 we
 have


inflation
 picking
 up
 and
 yeah
 we
 also


see
 a
 lot
 a
 job
 market
 maybe
 employment


levels
 look
 fine
 Yeah,


>> the
 momentum,
 the
 job
 growth
 that
 we're


seeing
 in
 the
 latest
 release
 is


understandably
 spooky,
 too.


>> I
 asked
 Mary
 Daily
 this
 question
 before,


but
 do
 starting
 points
 matter
 here?


Because
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 labor
 market,


the
 labor
 market
 has
 been
 really,
 really


strong
 in
 recent
 years,
 like
 certainly


much
 stronger
 than
 people
 had
 expected.


And
 so,
 okay,
 there
 are
 some
 signs
 of


softening
 now.
 It
 does
 seem
 to
 be
 losing


momentum,
 but
 we
 are
 still
 starting
 from


a
 place
 of
 strength.
 Does
 that
 mean


potentially
 the
 Fed
 can,
 you
 know,
 maybe


let
 that
 one
 go
 and
 look
 more
 at
 the


inflation
 risk?
 To
 your
 point,


>> I
 think
 it
 certainly
 matters.
 It's
 not


the
 only
 thing
 that
 matters.
 I
 think


momentum
 and
 starting
 point
 both
 matter.


And
 the
 starting
 point
 is
 better.
 The


momentum
 is
 some
 of
 the
 weakest
 we've


seen
 outside
 of
 a
 recession
 in
 a
 while.


>> Now,
 some
 of
 that
 might
 be
 due
 to


immigration.
 Some
 of
 that
 might
 be
 due


to
 tariff
 uncertainty.
 Some
 of
 that


might
 be
 due
 to


interest
 rates
 are
 higher.
 that
 matters


for
 some
 sectors
 more
 even
 if
 the


financial
 conditions
 you
 just
 talked


about
 are
 still
 pretty
 accommodative
 if


you're
 talking
 about
 capital
 markets.
 So


these
 are
 all
 kind
 of
 confusing
 in
 terms


of
 what
 is
 the
 actual
 like
 labor
 market


trajectory
 that's
 permissible.


I
 think
 the
 Fed
 is
 right
 now
 inclined
 to


cut
 September
 given
 what
 we've
 seen
 in


the
 labor
 market
 data.
 But
 I
 will
 just


warn
 just
 as
 the
 data
 got
 revised
 before


it
 could
 get
 revised
 again.
 It
 may
 be


the
 case
 that
 May
 and
 June
 were
 the


weakest
 months
 for
 job
 growth
 and
 that


we
 see
 some
 local
 acceleration
 just


because
 there's
 a
 little
 bit
 more


certainty
 on
 trade
 policy
 than
 there
 was


before.


>> Right?


>> So,
 there's
 still
 another
 jobs
 report


before
 the
 September
 meeting
 and
 there's


another
 batch
 of
 inflation
 data
 that's


also
 going
 to
 come
 out
 and
 I
 think
 that


will
 actually
 probably
 matter
 in
 the


sense
 that
 typically
 you
 see
 price


changes
 that
 are
 more
 volatile
 as
 you


get
 into
 back
 to
 school
 season,
 holiday


season,
 the
 turn
 of
 the
 calendar
 year.


what
 we've
 seen
 thus
 far
 is
 typically


the
 more
 benign
 months
 when
 you


typically
 don't
 see
 prices
 change
 that


much.
 So,
 there's
 still
 a
 lot
 to
 play


for
 in
 terms
 of
 going
 into
 the
 September


meeting.


>> So,
 here's
 the
 thing
 I've
 been
 thinking


about
 trying
 to
 conceptualize
 what's


going
 on.
 And
 you
 know,
 as
 Tracy


mentioned,
 we
 talked
 to
 Mary
 Daly
 last


week
 in
 Alaska
 and
 she's
 kind
 of
 the


view
 right
 now
 or
 she
 says
 that
 she
 does


not
 think
 that
 the
 tariffs
 will
 be


particularly
 inflationary
 or


inflationary
 on
 a
 sustained
 basis.
 And


you
 know
 there's
 certainly
 an
 argument


tariffs
 are
 tax
 increases
 and
 tax


increases
 we
 don't
 think
 of
 as


inflationary
 we
 think
 of
 them
 as
 uh


disinflationary
 if
 anything
 on
 the
 other


hand
 they
 throw
 a
 wrench
 into
 supply


chains
 they
 have
 very
 different
 effects


across
 different
 like
 they
 sort
 of


strike
 me
 as
 like
 a
 bit
 of
 just
 like


throwing
 sand
 into
 gears
 and
 if
 you


combine
 throwing
 sand
 into
 gears
 with


really
 big
 deficits
 and
 now
 that
 I'm


middleag
 I
 talk
 about
 deficits
 we
 got
 a


pretty
 big
 July
 deficit
 number.
 It
 was


10%
 higher
 than
 the
 year
 before.
 This
 is


despite
 the
 tariff
 revenue.
 If
 you're


throwing
 sand
 into
 gears
 of
 industry,


making
 commerce
 less
 efficient
 by


creating
 all
 these
 frictions
 and
 you're


pushing
 in
 all
 this
 money
 by
 expanding


deficits,
 that
 strikes
 me
 as
 a


potentially
 inflationary
 cocktail.
 I


would
 agree.
 I
 think
 it's
 possible
 you


have
 both,
 right?
 That
 there
 is
 some


what
 I
 would
 call
 stagflation
 light,


right?
 That
 it's
 obviously
 unemployment


rates
 are
 still
 low.
 That's
 pretty


distinct
 from
 the
 stagflation
 of
 the


70s.
 But
 the
 momentum
 in
 the
 labor


market
 seems
 weaker
 because
 I
 think


there
 probably
 is
 for
 any
 sort
 of
 trade


sensitive
 sector.
 Think
 about


construction,
 manufacturing,
 retail


trade,
 wholesale
 trade,
 warehousing.


These
 are
 all
 showing
 weakness
 in
 job


growth
 more
 recently.
 And
 so
 we're


seeing
 that
 side
 of
 the
 equation.
 That's


that
 should
 be
 disinflationary
 at
 the


margin
 because
 less
 labor
 income
 should


mean
 less
 consumer
 spending.
 And
 at
 the


same
 time,
 you're
 putting
 in
 costs,


adding
 to
 the
 business
 cost
 structure
 in


ways
 that
 businesses
 can't
 stomach


beyond
 a
 certain
 point,
 right?
 So
 some


businesses
 are
 probably
 well
 positioned


to
 absorb
 the
 hit
 to
 margin,
 but
 there's


a
 limit
 to
 that
 as
 well.
 I
 think
 the


issue
 with
 sort
 of
 the
 tarifftrade


shock,
 the
 modeling
 of
 it
 is
 if
 you
 have


costs
 be
 pushed
 through
 to
 consumers


over
 time,
 that
 can
 still
 be
 consistent


with
 just
 real
 incomes
 sort
 of
 declining


even
 if
 uh
 nominal
 income
 growth
 is
 on


steadier
 footing.
 And
 so
 that
 would
 be


>> a
 very
 tricky
 backdrop
 for
 the
 Fed
 to


navigate.


>> Just
 going
 back
 to
 inflation
 for
 a


second,
 can
 you
 walk
 us
 through
 what's


going
 on
 with
 energy
 prices
 at
 the


moment?
 Because
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 oil


still
 pretty
 low
 as
 we
 talked
 a
 lot


about
 in
 Alaska.
 They
 don't
 love
 that
 in


Alaska.
 Yeah.
 People
 really
 care
 about


the
 price
 of
 oil
 in
 Alaska.
 Not


necessarily
 the
 way
 that
 most
 car


driving
 Americans
 do.


>> It's
 funny
 like
 in
 America
 an
 oil
 in
 the


quote
 lower
 48,
 which
 is
 a
 term
 I
 never


use
 as
 much
 than
 in
 the
 last
 week.
 It's


like
 an
 oil
 crisis
 is
 when
 it's
 really


high
 there.
 It's
 the
 exact
 opposite.


Anyway,
 keep
 going.


>> That's
 right.
 Okay.
 So
 oil
 prices
 are


low,
 but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 we're
 seeing


some
 electricity
 prices
 rise,
 possibly
 a


sort
 of
 crowding
 out
 effect
 from
 all
 the


data
 center
 demand
 and
 AI
 enthusiasm
 and


things
 like
 that.


>> Yeah.
 So
 I
 think
 that
 there's
 a


bifurcation
 in
 energy
 prices,
 right?
 So


we
 have
 your
 standard
 commodity
 prices


specifically
 for
 oil
 have
 stayed
 at
 the


lower
 end
 of
 the
 range,
 right?
 We're


still
 speaking
 in
 the
 maybe
 low
 60s,


right?
 In
 WTI.
 So
 these
 are
 prices
 that


should
 be
 not
 painful
 for
 the
 consumer


and
 yet
 we
 also
 have
 electricity
 price


increases
 and
 the
 electricity
 price


increases
 that
 we've
 seen
 some
 part
 of


that
 is
 due
 to
 natural
 gas
 price


volatility
 although
 natural
 gas
 prices


more
 recently
 have
 come
 down
 but
 there's


also
 an
 in
 there
 are a
 lot
 of
 things


that
 go
 into
 electricity
 prices
 that
 are


independent
 of
 that
 and
 so
 in
 a
 lot
 of


regions
 of
 the
 country
 we're
 seeing


capacity
 looks
 to
 be
 short
 for
 the


longest
 time
 a
 lot
 of
 these
 a
 lot
 of


what
 you
 call
 sort
 thermal
 sources
 of


electricity
 generation
 are
 typically
 not


very
 economical,
 right?
 We're
 economical


in
 a
 shortrun
 sense
 because
 uh
 we
 have


more
 capacity
 than
 we
 need.
 So
 the


ability
 to
 be
 paid
 for
 that
 capacity
 is


not
 great.
 So
 that's
 why
 we
 retire
 coal


plants,
 we
 retire
 nuclear
 plants.


>> Now
 you're
 seeing
 the
 other
 side
 of


that,
 right?
 And
 it
 takes
 a
 long
 time
 to


build
 that
 stuff.
 And
 so
 the
 retirements


have
 are
 coming
 to
 a
 pause
 for
 hey


actually
 we
 might
 be
 short
 on
 capacity


if
 the
 data
 center
 demands
 are
 there
 and


building
 new
 capacity
 is
 very
 expensive


very
 time
 uh
 intensive
 and
 that
 seems
 to


be
 an
 issue
 in
 at least
 a
 number
 of


major
 regions.
 So
 there's
 like
 the


Mid-Atlantic
 region,
 PJM.
 You're
 hearing


this
 also
 show
 up
 though
 in
 terms
 of


rates
 are
 increasing
 in
 Georgia
 and
 New


England
 has
 its
 own
 set
 of
 problems


because
 it
 burns
 a
 lot
 of
 natural
 gas


for
 electricity,
 but
 also
 doesn't
 have
 a


like
 the
 requisite
 pipeline
 capacity.


>> I
 love
 that
 I'm
 double
 hedged
 to
 New


England
 energy
 prices
 plus
 Coned
 in
 New


York.
 Although
 Although
 I
 do
 have
 solar


panels
 in
 Connecticut
 now,
 as
 we
 were


discussing,
 so
 sometimes
 sometimes
 my


bill
 is
 actually
 negative,
 which
 is


lovely.
 the
 Texas
 hedge.
 This
 is
 the


thing
 which
 is
 that
 so
 I
 mentioned
 at


the
 beginning
 so
 much
 investment


happening
 in
 AI
 which
 doesn't
 seem
 to


like
 I
 mean
 doesn't
 seem
 to
 be
 paying


off
 economy
 wide
 yet.
 It's
 not
 like


we've
 seen
 some
 great
 disinflationary


boom
 or
 all
 these
 companies
 suddenly


getting
 more
 efficient
 though
 maybe


there
 I'm
 sure
 you
 can
 find
 pockets
 but


there
 is
 a
 lot
 of
 spending
 and
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 spending
 on
 gear
 and
 there's
 a


lot
 of
 spending
 on
 buildings
 and
 a


little
 bit
 of
 spending
 on
 labor.
 You


know
 some
 people
 have
 been
 talking
 about


this
 crowding
 out
 effect.
 Jason
 Ferman


talked
 about
 it
 in
 a
 tweet
 that
 maybe


this
 is
 feels
 like
 a
 fiscal
 crowding.
 Is


that
 fair
 at
 this
 point
 or
 is
 it
 too


soon
 to
 tell
 like
 whether
 all
 this


expenditure


>> has
 been
 writing
 about
 this
 quite
 a
 bit


as
 well?


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 curious
 how
 do
 you


characterize
 it
 right
 now?


>> I
 mean
 obviously
 there's
 some
 bid
 for


resources
 that
 could
 otherwise
 be


deployed
 elsewhere
 and
 also
 a
 bit
 sort


of
 if
 if
 let's
 say
 you're
 an
 investor


and
 you're
 obviously
 some
 level
 of


capital
 constraint
 going
 on.
 If
 you're


investing
 everything
 in
 AI
 and
 basically


cutting
 spending
 and
 investment
 in
 other


areas,
 there's
 some
 sort
 of
 crowding
 out


effect.
 But
 I
 would
 just
 also
 caution


that's
 like
 a
 secondary
 effect,
 right?


The
 the
 primary
 one
 is
 still
 that


there's
 more
 investment
 less.


>> On
 the
 electricity
 front
 though,
 is
 that


connected
 or
 is
 that
 still
 just
 our
 menu


factors
 pushing
 up
 electricity
 across


and
 maybe
 data
 centers
 are
 one?


>> I
 think
 the
 data
 center
 effect
 is


something
 probably
 better
 to
 describe
 up


until
 this
 very
 moment
 like
 we're


probably
 hitting
 something
 of
 an


inflection
 point,
 right?
 So
 you
 are
 like


low
 demand
 for
 electricity
 has
 stopped


sort
 of
 having
 sort
 of
 its
 local


stagnation.


>> Okay.
 Yeah.


>> But
 we
 haven't
 yet
 seen
 the
 pickup.
 The


pickup
 is
 probably
 coming
 very
 soon
 or


maybe
 right
 now.
 And
 as
 that
 happens
 and


it
 has
 its
 pass
 through
 into
 pricing


over
 the
 coming
 years.
 I
 think
 there


will
 be
 some
 a
 sort
 of
 super
 cycle


dynamic
 to
 this
 that
 is
 likely
 to
 weigh


on
 costs
 and
 investment.
 Just
 sorry
 just


to
 be
 clear
 like
 those
 like
 price


increases
 in
 Georgia
 that
 people
 are


talking
 about
 or
 you
 it's
 too
 early
 to


say
 oh
 that's
 data
 centers.


>> It's
 a
 sort
 of
 yes
 and
 no
 question
 where


economists
 give
 you
 both
 answers
 because


it's
 like
 if
 something
 stops
 going
 down


it
 starts
 flattening
 out
 and
 starts
 to


pick
 up.
 There
 is
 a
 like
 it
 may
 not
 have


started
 going
 up
 in
 outright
 terms
 but


the
 dynamic
 is
 it's
 part
 of
 the
 dynamic.


So
 I
 think
 that
 I
 think
 it's
 it's
 both.

[Music]


As
 we
 mentioned,
 Joe
 and
 I
 are
 going
 to


Jackson
 Hole
 next
 week,
 and
 the
 theme


doesn't
 really
 matter.
 The
 theme
 is


central
 bank
 independence
 and
 if
 Powell


is
 going
 to
 do
 what
 the
 what
 President


Trump
 is
 asking
 him
 to
 do,
 which
 is
 cut


rates.


I'm
 thinking
 how
 to
 characterize
 this


question.
 How
 does
 like
 the
 central
 bank


dynamic
 actually
 feed
 into
 the


discussion
 around
 rates?


>> I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the
 there
 is
 on
 one


level
 the
 Fed
 will
 tell
 you
 they're


putting
 the
 blinders
 on.
 They
 don't


listen
 to
 what
 Scott
 Besson
 is
 most


actively
 lobbying
 for
 was
 50
 basis


points.


>> And
 yet,
 you
 can't
 deny
 that
 there
 is


going
 to
 be
 some
 issue
 of
 how
 does
 the


Fed
 do
 something
 in
 a
 way
 where
 it


doesn't
 look
 politically
 manipulated.


the
 legitimacy
 in
 some
 ways
 of
 whatever


the
 Fed
 does
 gets
 undermined.


>> There's
 an
 optics
 problem.


>> If
 they
 don't
 do
 what
 the
 Treasury
 says,


then
 they're
 clearly
 trying
 to
 push
 back


against
 the
 Treasury
 in
 some
 way.
 And
 so


then
 there
 will
 be
 one
 set
 of


stakeholders
 who
 are
 upset.
 And
 at
 the


same
 time,
 there
 are
 others
 who
 will
 be


saying
 like
 if
 the
 Fed
 does
 cut
 50
 basis


points,
 it's
 like
 okay,
 they're
 just


following
 Treasury.
 We
 should
 just


listen
 to
 Scott
 Bessent
 now.
 And
 that
 is


a
 dilemma
 for
 how
 you
 really
 handle
 the


optics.
 Mary
 Daly
 talked
 about
 this
 on


your
 episode
 which
 was
 just
 you
 got
 to


try
 to
 just
 explain
 your
 decisions.
 Try


to
 be
 transparent.
 Try
 to
 be
 consistent.


Those
 are
 really
 important
 things.
 It


will
 matter
 to
 a
 point
 and
 yet
 I'm
 sure


there'll
 be
 plenty
 of
 cynics.
 Start


tweeting
 in
 all
 caps.


>> Tracy,
 uh,
 did
 you
 see
 the
 headline


yesterday?
 I
 think
 it
 was
 attributing


CNBC
 that
 David
 Zervos
 is
 on
 Trump's


short.
 No,
 you
 guys
 laugh.
 I
 like
 David.


I
 We
 have
 never
 had
 him
 on
 OddLog
 and


which
 is
 an
 oversight.
 I've
 always
 liked


talking
 to
 David
 though,
 but
 I
 feel


like,
 you
 know,
 we
 never
 got,


unfortunately,
 Paul
 McCully
 on
 the
 Fed,


the
 long-haired
 iconocclassic
 guy
 from


industry.


>> Oh,
 yeah.


>> And
 David
 Zervos
 is
 like
 our
 the
 next


best
 shot
 of
 this
 sort
 of
 iconoc
 classic


guy
 who
 comes
 from
 Wall
 Street.
 I
 like


David.
 I
 like
 David.
 I
 feel
 like,
 you


know,
 he's
 like
 the
 closest
 thing
 to


like
 a
 contemporary
 kind
 of
 a


mccaulayish
 character.
 I
 will
 say
 from
 a


saratoral
 perspective
 it
 would
 be
 very


interesting.


>> Yeah,
 I
 like
 I've
 always
 loved
 talking


to
 David.


>> I
 mean
 he
 would
 certainly
 be
 a
 character


and
 so
 you
 would
 probably
 get
 livelier


uh
 press
 conference.


>> A
 great
 press
 coverage.
 Do
 you
 have
 any


thoughts
 on
 the
 derby?
 Every
 day
 the


list
 of
 names
 gets
 longer.
 Do
 you
 have


any
 thoughts
 on
 this
 process?


>> I
 can't
 take
 it
 seriously.
 Right.
 I


think
 as
 far
 as
 the
 number
 of
 names
 that


have
 been
 thrown
 out,
 I
 don't
 think


Janet
 Yellen
 is
 being
 considered


actively.
 Okay.
 So
 these
 are
 these
 are


things
 that
 that
 see
 seem
 very
 very
 um


>> that
 one
 elicited
 I
 saw
 that
 headline


too
 and
 um
 yeah
 there
 are
 some
 names


there
 that
 do


>> so
 I
 I
 mean
 there
 are
 some
 names
 to
 take


seriously.
 I'm
 not
 saying
 but
 I
 I
 do


think
 the
 length
 of
 the
 list
 being


offered
 some
 of
 them
 are
 clearly
 not


serious
 names
 being
 put
 forth
 but
 it
 may


serve
 some
 tactical
 purpose
 for
 the
 kind


of
 policies
 they
 want.
 If
 they're
 trying


to
 broaden
 the
 list
 of
 people
 who


they're
 considering,
 get
 those
 people
 to


lobby
 more
 actively
 and
 publicly
 for


lower
 rates,
 then
 that
 might
 be


something
 White
 House.


>> Nick Dick
 Timos
 at
 the
 Journal
 pointed


this
 out
 in
 an
 article,
 which
 is
 that
 if


you
 have
 a
 hundred
 people
 who
 all
 think


that
 they're
 in
 the
 running
 to
 be
 Fed


chair,
 that's
 a
 100
 people
 going
 on
 TV


saying
 now
 is
 a
 great
 time
 to
 cut
 rates.


And
 then
 you're
 sort
 of
 like,
 wait,
 why


isn't
 Powell
 cutting
 rates?
 Everyone
 on


TV
 knows
 now
 is
 the
 time.
 So
 there's


some
 deep
 brilliance
 going
 on
 here.
 I
 I


do
 have
 to
 ask
 though
 like
 the
 all
 the


lobbying
 for
 lower
 rates
 we
 have


substantial
 number
 of
 rate
 cuts
 priced


in
 over
 the
 next
 12
 months
 and
 yet


long-term
 interest
 rates
 haven't
 really


budged
 that
 much.


>> Yeah.


>> Which
 is
 if
 you
 think
 about
 like
 where


the
 pain
 points
 and
 the
 frustration
 are


with
 like
 higher
 interest
 rates
 right


now
 or
 at least
 for
 if
 you
 to
 the
 extent


you
 think
 4.3%
 Fed
 funds
 rate
 is
 high


and
 that's
 part
 of
 the
 reason
 why
 10ear


yields
 are
 at
 4.2
 2
 4.3%
 roughly


speaking
 like
 you're
 not
 getting
 much


effect
 from
 the
 rate
 rate
 cuts
 being


priced
 right
 now.
 And
 I
 do
 think
 that


kind
 of
 raised
 some
 questions
 about
 what


is
 the
 actual
 objective
 here
 if
 even
 if


you
 get
 the
 rate
 cuts
 you
 so
 desperately


wish
 especially
 if
 it's
 coming


>> doesn't
 feed
 into
 like
 the
 30-year


mortgage
 rate.


>> Yeah,
 exactly.
 Like
 housing
 was
 the
 big


pain
 point
 and
 you're
 not
 really
 getting


that
 effect.
 That
 to
 me
 suggests
 like


there
 is
 some
 level
 of
 a
 credibility
 gap


here.
 If
 you're
 just
 saying
 I'm
 gonna


cut
 rates
 no matter
 what,
 no matter
 what


the
 inflation
 rate
 is
 because
 I
 want
 to


do
 it
 for
 political
 motivation.
 I
 mean,


I
 want
 investors
 obviously
 need
 to
 be


compensated
 on
 some
 level
 for
 risk
 or


also
 for
 the
 risk
 that
 maybe
 some
 in
 the


future
 rates
 might
 go
 back
 up.
 If
 the


people
 who
 are
 arguing
 for
 lower
 rates


today
 would
 argue
 for
 higher
 rates
 under


a
 different
 political
 environment,


that's
 not
 exactly
 that
 doesn't
 lend


itself
 to
 keeping
 getting
 long-term


interest
 rates
 lower.
 And


>> oh,
 what's
 your
 take
 on
 why
 long-term


interest
 rates
 haven't
 gone
 lower?
 I


think
 there's
 probably
 two
 things
 here


that
 stick
 out
 to
 me.
 One
 is
 well


inflation
 still
 seems
 like
 it's
 there,


right?
 We
 haven't
 gotten
 things
 back
 to


2%.
 And
 so
 there's
 just
 a
 risk
 of
 the


Fed
 being
 caught
 off
 sides
 here
 if
 the


Fed
 starts
 to
 cut
 more
 aggressively
 at
 a


time
 when
 inflation
 might
 pick
 up.
 You


can
 say,
 well,
 this
 time
 inflation's


transitory,
 but
 it's
 like
 we're
 dealing


with
 potentially
 big
 macro
 adjustments.


They
 might
 be
 costly
 and
 if
 nominal


incomes,
 labor
 income
 growth
 is


reasonably
 solid,
 the
 cost
 might
 get


pushed
 through,
 right,
 to
 the
 consumer


because
 the
 consumer
 can
 pay
 and
 that's


a
 dynamic
 that
 markets
 have
 to
 be


sensitive
 to.
 So
 there's
 a
 level
 of
 well


you're
 actually
 adding
 more
 inflation


risk
 and
 so
 that
 needs
 to
 be
 compensated


for.
 There's
 also
 I
 think
 a
 level
 of


political
 manipulation
 risk,
 right?
 That


if
 you
 actually
 did
 lower
 rates
 for


reasons
 that
 aren't
 really
 grounded
 in


data,
 I
 mean
 Kevin
 War
 said,
 "I
 don't


care
 about
 data
 dependence."
 If
 you're


not
 doing
 things
 for
 like
 relatively


neutral
 reasons
 and
 you're
 doing
 things


for
 political
 convenience,


>> one,
 the
 political
 convenience
 can
 cut


the
 other
 way
 at
 at
 another
 point
 in


time.
 Let's
 say
 there
 are
 people
 who
 are


doing
 things
 for
 partisan
 reasons
 today


and
 maybe
 it's
 a
 different
 person
 in
 the


White
 House
 in
 the
 future.
 And
 then


there's
 also
 just
 the
 issue
 of
 well


>> there's
 just
 more
 instability.
 I
 want


more
 compensation
 for
 that
 risk.
 And
 I


do
 think
 like
 we're
 seeing
 if
 you
 look


at
 the
 slope
 between
 five
 years,
 five


year
 notes
 and
 10
 year
 notes
 abnormally


high
 even
 considering
 that
 rate
 cuts


have
 been
 priced
 in.
 I
 know
 that
 Joe
 is


a
 term
 premium
 skeptic
 and
 I
 to
 some


extent
 am
 too,
 but
 I
 do
 think
 that


there's
 more
 suggestive
 evidence
 now


that
 you
 are
 seeing
 more
 demands
 for


compensation
 for
 risk
 and
 that
 again


kind
 of
 speaks
 to
 undermining


independence.
 If
 you
 think
 think
 this


process
 of
 setting
 interest
 rates
 is
 not


really
 being
 guided
 by
 something


relatively
 neutral
 politically,


something
 that's
 more
 focused
 on
 the


data,
 but
 is
 really
 just
 about
 pleasing


certain
 presidential
 preferences
 and


whims
 on
 a
 short-term
 basis.
 As
 a


long-term
 investor,
 I
 might
 want
 more


compensation
 for
 that.
 I
 think
 there's


some
 some
 merit
 to
 that
 argument
 at


least.


>> Don't
 worry,
 at
 Jackson
 Hole,
 Joe
 and
 I


are
 going
 to
 sit
 around
 a
 campfire
 and


meditate
 on
 the
 meaning
 of
 the
 term


premium.


>> Yeah,
 that's
 right.
 We're
 going to
 get


it
 figured
 out
 next
 week.


[Music]


[Music]


Don't
 these
 clowns
 in
 Washington
 DC
 need


to
 stop
 their
 addiction
 to
 borrowing


money?


I'm
 entering
 my
 AM
 radio.


>> This
 is
 This
 is
 back
 to
 your
 middle
 age.


>> Yeah,
 I'm
 entering
 I'm
 I I
 want
 to
 be
 a


yaker
 on
 AM
 radio.
 Don't
 these
 clowns
 in


DC
 need
 to
 stop
 spending?
 But
 deficits


are
 very
 large.
 Like,
 you
 know,
 setting


aside
 politics,
 they're
 very
 big,


especially
 given
 the
 low
 level
 of


unemployment
 rate,
 4.2%.
 Like,
 we're


spending
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 and
 that's
 a
 lot


of
 money
 being
 pushed
 into
 the
 economy.


Much
 of
 it
 going
 to
 low
 productivity


areas
 because
 of
 the
 growth
 like


healthcare,
 etc.
 Don't
 we
 need
 to
 have


some
 good
 old-fashioned
 fiscal


consolidation
 with
 inflation
 still
 at


these
 elevated
 levels?
 There's
 certainly


an
 argument
 for
 if
 you
 wanted
 to
 try
 and


get
 demand
 down
 then
 you
 could
 possibly


do
 that,
 right?
 So
 if
 you
 think
 demand


is
 is
 a
 problem,
 right?
 Then
 you


probably
 wouldn't
 be
 so
 worried
 about


the
 labor
 market,
 right?
 So
 that's
 one


one
 part
 of
 it.
 I
 also
 say
 like
 folks


that
 have
 been
 saying
 this
 the
 tariffs


are
 a
 big
 revenue
 raiser,
 right?
 One


part
 of
 it
 is


>> yeah,


>> we're
 still
 seeing
 like
 either
 the
 fact


is
 like
 it's
 just
 doesn't
 matter
 in
 the


context
 of
 the
 deficit.


>> Yeah.


>> In
 which
 case
 it's
 not
 a
 big
 revenue


raiser.
 That's
 one
 argument
 you
 can


make.
 If
 you
 think
 it's
 actually
 still
 a


lot
 of
 lot
 of
 money
 being
 raised
 and
 yet


we're
 still
 seeing
 10-year
 yield


dynamics
 as
 they
 are,
 maybe
 it's


something
 else.
 I
 mean,
 I
 think
 the


problem
 always
 with
 stories
 about


deficits
 and
 how
 they
 drive
 interest


rates
 tend
 to
 always
 be
 there's
 like
 a


missing
 link
 there
 or
 at least
 there's


not
 a
 lot
 of
 robust
 correlation
 here


between
 the
 scale
 of
 the
 deficit
 and


what
 interest
 rates
 end
 up
 looking
 like.


And
 I
 do
 think
 like
 institutional


descriptions
 of
 what's
 going
 on
 kind
 of


have
 a
 little
 more
 merit.
 like
 we
 are


doing
 some
 things
 as
 a
 central
 bank
 and


in
 ways
 that
 can
 undermine
 investor


confidence.
 I
 think
 that
 strikes
 me
 as


more
 compelling,
 but
 at
 the
 margin
 if


you
 wanted
 to
 address
 the
 deficit
 for


whatever
 reason,
 yeah,
 there's
 probably


a
 lot
 of
 room
 to
 do
 that
 when
 we've
 just


did
 a
 pretty
 big
 sort
 of
 consolidation


of
 corporate
 tax
 cuts
 and
 at
 the
 same


time
 like
 there's
 obviously
 an
 aging


population
 that
 does
 have
 more
 demands


for
 the
 major
 social
 insurance
 programs.


>> Cracky
 Joe.


>> Yeah,
 become
 a
 crack.
 It's
 just
 like
 we


need
 to
 I'm
 not
 I
 don't
 give
 policy


advice.
 By
 the
 way,
 Tracy,
 we're
 talking


to
 Scanda
 Amaroth,
 executive
 director
 of


employment.
 20
 minutes
 in.
 Probably


should.


>> Okay,
 so
 we're
 going
 to
 Jackson
 Hole.


One
 of
 the
 nice
 things
 about
 Jackson


Hole
 is
 that
 you
 can
 run
 into
 people,


you
 know,
 just
 if
 you're
 hiking
 outside


of
 the
 lodge,
 the
 hotel
 over
 there.
 If


we
 were
 to
 run
 into
 Jerome
 Pal,


>> what's
 the
 one
 question
 we
 should
 ask


him?
 Well,
 the
 one
 question
 I
 selfishly


am
 interested
 in
 is
 what
 are
 they
 going


to
 do
 with
 the
 FRA
 framework
 here,


right?
 So,
 the
 framework
 review
 that
 was


there
 was
 much
 fanfare
 about
 it
 in
 2019


and
 2020.


>> This
 is
 the
 whole
 fate
 thing,
 right?


>> This
 was
 the
 fate
 thing.
 This
 was
 when


they
 cited
 flexible
 average
 inflation


targeting
 that
 high
 employment
 wasn't


inherently
 a
 bad
 thing
 or
 inherently
 an


inflationary
 thing.
 They
 made
 some


tweaks
 to
 their
 framework.
 There
 are


people
 who
 blame
 those
 tweaks
 for
 the


reason
 why
 the
 Fed
 allowed
 all
 this


inflation
 to
 happen.
 I
 think
 they
 kind


of
 mess
 around
 with
 some


counterfactuals,
 but
 they
 are
 doing
 the


same
 exercise
 now,
 but
 just
 much
 more


low
 profile.
 And
 maybe
 that
 makes
 sense


because
 this
 is
 sort
 of
 a
 time
 of


leadership
 flux
 where
 there
 is
 going
 to


be
 someone
 else
 who's
 fed
 chair
 in
 a


year.
 And
 maybe
 that
 person
 will
 want
 to


have
 more
 of
 a
 say
 and
 doesn't
 want
 to


be
 stomped
 on.
 But
 I
 they
 have
 said
 that


they
 want
 to
 do
 some
 of
 these
 changes
 to


their
 framework
 and
 then
 do
 a
 review
 of


their
 communications.
 And
 especially
 at


a
 moment
 when
 you
 have
 these
 conflicting


forces
 where
 there
 are
 things
 that
 are


pushing
 up
 inflation
 at
 the
 same
 time


there
 are
 signs
 that
 labor
 markets
 are


slowing.
 It
 just
 feels
 like
 what
 the


Fed's
 going
 to
 communicate
 is
 going
 to


be
 confusing.
 I
 want
 a
 good
 example
 of


this
 from
 s
 episode
 with
 Mary
 Dailyaly


was
 basically
 saying
 well
 we
 have
 goods


inflation
 that
 might
 be
 tariffs
 but
 like


services
 xousing
 looks
 to
 be
 like
 not


inflationary.
 And
 the
 Fed
 basically
 said


the
 same
 story
 in
 2021.
 And
 then
 it


spread.
 And
 it
 spread
 because
 for
 some


people
 say,
 well,
 it's
 because
 labor


market's
 too
 strong.


>> They
 kind
 of
 missed
 that
 goods
 prices


matter
 to
 service
 prices.
 So
 think
 about


insurance.
 Think
 about
 uh
 m
 the
 cost
 of


goods
 matters
 there.
 If
 you
 think
 about


leasing,
 rental,
 airfare
 is
 matter
 are


affected
 by
 energy
 prices,
 food
 services


prices
 are
 affected
 by
 food
 prices.
 And


so
 the
 Fed
 could
 easily
 be
 caught
 off


sides
 again.
 And
 I
 think
 that's


something
 that
 I
 I
 worry
 about


independent
 of
 whoever
 is
 the
 leader,


whether
 it's
 Chris
 Waller,
 whether
 it's


Kevin
 Walsh,
 whether
 it's


>> David
 Zervos,


>> David
 David
 Zervos.


>> This
 is
 something
 that
 I
 think
 is
 really


unappreciated.
 You
 know,
 we've
 seen
 car


insurers
 saying
 that
 they're
 going
 to


raise
 rates
 because
 the
 cost
 of
 parts
 is


expected
 to
 go
 up
 under
 tariffs.
 And


there
 are
 all
 these
 sort
 of
 hidden


connections
 in
 the
 economy,


>> as
 we
 learned
 on
 our
 trip
 to
 Alaska
 once


again,
 where
 you
 could
 see
 tariff


inflation
 start
 to
 show
 up.
 So,
 one


example
 is,
 you
 know,
 you
 think
 you're


buying
 Alaskan
 salmon
 made
 in
 Alaska,


caught
 in
 Alaska,
 but
 it
 turns
 out
 a


bunch
 of
 that
 salmon
 gets
 sent
 to
 China


for
 processing,
 and
 so
 it
 gets


reimpported
 into
 the
 US.
 And
 so,
 even


something
 like
 Alaskan
 salmon,
 you
 would


see
 a
 tariff
 impact.


>> I
 know
 we
 we
 should
 do
 we
 didn't
 do
 a


fish
 episode,
 but
 I
 that
 was
 really
 I


didn't
 had
 not
 realized
 how
 much


American
 fish
 is
 processed
 to
 China,


then
 reimpported.
 It's
 really
 the


miracle
 of
 shipping.
 I
 have
 one
 last
 um


one
 last
 question.
 Things
 are
 like
 so
 c


stocks
 are
 doing
 fine.
 He's
 like
 all


this
 doom
 and
 all
 this
 stuff
 and


politics
 and
 the
 deficit
 and
 interest


rate
 and
 etc.
 Like
 stocks
 are
 like
 super


forward-looking.
 Is
 is
 it
 100%?
 Yeah,


but
 that's
 cuz
 it's
 all
 this
 like
 tech


money
 and
 AI
 spending.
 That
 doesn't


totally
 satisfy
 me.
 There's
 other
 parts


that
 finance
 and
 doing
 like
 what's
 going


on
 there
 that
 does
 not
 seem
 like
 a


market
 that
 is
 worried
 about
 all
 these


things
 that
 we
 talk
 about.
 Yeah,
 it
 does


seem
 like
 there's
 more
 growth
 optimism


in
 cav
 markets
 and
 I
 think
 tech
 is
 part


of
 the
 story
 right
 now.
 know
 the
 S&P
 500


you
 kind
 of
 adjust
 for
 a


reclassification
 is
 about
 half
 tech


right
 so
 it's
 clearly
 growing
 in
 terms


of
 its
 relevance
 and
 at
 the
 same
 time


all
 this
 tech
 spending
 is
 probably


keeping
 the
 business
 cycle
 afloat
 on


some
 level
 at least
 more
 so
 than
 it


would
 otherwise
 be
 the
 case
 but
 if
 you


look
 at
 stuff
 like
 even
 in
 equal


weighted
 S&P
 you
 look
 at
 other
 sort
 of


measures
 that
 may
 be
 more
 neutral
 to
 the


tech
 dynamic
 they've
 also
 shown
 decent


amount
 of
 optimism
 right
 so
 those
 are


also
 telling
 you
 there's
 a
 lot
 of


confidence


that
 confidence
 might
 be
 misplaced,
 but


over
 at
 least
 the
 short
 run,
 like


there's
 some
 wisdom
 in
 it.
 And
 that
 to


me
 is
 like
 a
 reason
 to
 probably
 shade


against
 the
 bleakest
 view
 right
 now.
 And


I
 think
 even
 if
 you
 look
 at
 the
 jobs


report
 that
 everyone
 I
 think
 rightfully


said
 has
 a
 lot
 of
 weakness
 in
 it,
 look


at
 total
 hours
 growth
 among
 rank
 and


file
 employees.
 If
 you
 look
 at
 total


income
 growth
 among
 those
 workers,
 it's


pretty
 fine.
 Much
 fine.
 It
 was
 not
 that


was
 actually
 okay.
 And
 so
 we
 might
 have


gotten
 the
 worst
 jobs
 report
 already.
 If


we
 don't,
 then
 obviously
 the
 Fed
 can


probably
 have
 more
 confidence
 cutting.


But
 if
 it's
 actually
 the
 case
 that
 like


ah
 there's
 actually
 was
 a
 we
 had
 a


liberation
 day
 shock
 but
 it
 was
 didn't


break
 things
 especially
 because
 things


got
 reversed
 to
 a
 large
 degree
 then
 you


might
 be
 left
 with
 a
 situation
 where


it's
 just
 slowing
 growth
 in
 real
 terms


and
 maybe
 the
 nominal
 trajectory
 of
 the


economy
 that
 total
 dollar
 spend
 total


dollars
 earned
 aren't
 as
 adversely


affected
 and
 that
 might
 not
 be
 a
 world


in
 which
 you
 expect
 both
 high
 rate
 cuts


or
 anything
 that's
 sort
 of
 deeply


recessionary
 at
 least
 in
 the
 short
 run.


Tracy,
 you
 know,
 I
 did
 run
 into
 Jerome


Pow,
 you
 know,
 in
 Jackson
 Hall
 just
 like


serendipitously.


>> Oh,
 I
 forgot
 about
 that.


>> Yeah,
 I
 know.
 It
 was
 like
 It
 was
 You


hadn't
 come
 yet
 and
 it
 was
 just
 in
 the


lodge
 and
 he
 was
 sitting
 there
 with
 a


couple
 of
 people.
 I
 think
 he
 was


talking.


>> Did
 you
 say
 hi?


>> Yeah.
 And
 I
 froze.
 Like
 I
 did
 I
 froze


because
 I
 couldn't
 really
 think.
 It


didn't
 seem
 like
 the
 right
 time
 to
 like


actually
 like
 talk
 shop.
 In
 retrospect,


I
 should
 have
 like
 said
 something
 about


the
 dead
 and
 like
 you
 know
 told
 because


I
 had
 seen
 Denco
 that
 year


>> and
 I
 should
 that
 would
 have
 been
 a
 good


thing.
 But
 I
 said,
 "Oh,
 it's
 really


beautiful
 here
 in
 Jack.
 I've
 never
 been


like
 I
 sounded
 really
 stupid.


>> I
 yelled
 at
 one
 of
 his
 Secret
 Service


people
 without
 knowing
 it
 was
 one
 of
 his


Secret
 Service
 people.
 He
 was
 like
 he


was
 stuffing
 a
 bag
 into
 the
 airplane


>> in
 a
 really
 violent
 way
 that
 was


crushing
 my
 own
 bag
 that
 had
 something


kind
 of
 breakable
 in
 it.
 And
 so
 I
 was


like,
 "Excuse
 me,
 stop
 doing
 that."
 And


then
 he
 got
 really
 angry.


>> Yeah.
