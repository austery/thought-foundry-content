Last month, "Sando Monkey's Life" became a hit
Many people began to discuss the plight of lower-class men in Taiwan
In the political arena, various sexism and misogyny controversies continue
After the #MeToo movement
Various red pill and PUA discussions have emerged again
These topics will ultimately return to a fundamental question
patriarchy
But what exactly is fatherhood?
How does patriarchy work?
The book I’m going to face today is “The Gender Knot”
The author is American sociologist Allan Johnson
It’s time to explain clearly the ins and outs of fatherhood.
Let’s understand together what paternity is
How does patriarchy oppress women and men?
How to dismantle patriarchy?
First, let’s define what paternity is
We say a society is patriarchal
The operation of representative power is "primarily" male dominance, male identity, and male center
"Mainly" means exceptions are allowed
Because as long as the underlying power structure is not challenged
Patriarchy can actually accept a few women in power
For example, Mrs Thatcher in the UK is the most typical example
Looks like women are in charge
But the policies pursued by Thatcher were still patriarchal.
Fatherhood is male dominance
As the name suggests, men monopolize power
For example, all important positions in society are held by men.
Ensure men have the upper hand
The Labor Bank also conducted a survey
Nearly 60% of women believe that
Gender discrimination in the workplace is very serious
Nearly 70% of women
Feel like I have no influence at work
Some people will argue that there are many women in power.
But if women take power in a male-dominated system
You will be forced to participate in men's play
So the more powerful a woman is, the less like a woman she is.
But the more powerful a man is, the more he becomes like a man
For example, Tsai Ing-wen is the first female president of Taiwan
Will they be attacked and asked why they are not married?
Why no family?
Next, fatherhood is male identity.
Using men as the default to define normal standards
For example, at work, the boss sets high working hours
In fact, it is already preset
When men go home, they don’t have to do housework and take care of the children.
It is assumed that there is a woman in the family who will take care of these chores
Or the competitiveness, professionalism, and self-control praised by corporate culture
These are the masculine traits promoted by patriarchy
If girls agree with these values, they will be regarded as strong women and too strong.
On the contrary, it will not please men
Finally, fatherhood is male-centered
Just look at everything from a man’s perspective
For example, artistic and cultural works from the past thousands of years
There are always men who define what a good-looking woman is.
When a woman dresses herself up
I have to think about whether men think I’m good-looking
If you can’t live up to the beauty set by patriarchy
You will feel not feminine enough
<font color=#FFF300FF>You look like...</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>you look like...</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>a liner</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>a doily.</font>
Until the feminist movement in the 20th century
Women are slowly awakening
Life is no longer about pleasing men
Instead, focus on your own life
<font color=#FFE400FF>Hey Barbie</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>hey Barbie.</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>Can I come to your house tonight? </font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>Can i come to your house tonight?</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>Okay</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>sure.</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>I don’t have anything big planned tonight</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>I don’t have anything big planned</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies, </font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>just a giant blowout party with all the Barbies, </font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>There is also a line dance, and a title song</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>and planned choreography, and a bespoke song.</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>You can come and take a look</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>You should stop by.</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>酷噎</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>so cool.</font>
So the summary definition:
Patriarchy means male dominance, male identity, and male center
hear this definition
Many men will protest
I don't feel like I'm the center
Many girls live better lives than me, a loser.
Many men do not feel they have a sense of dominance and do not receive the benefits of fatherhood.
Just use personal experience to deny the existence of patriarchy
This is the wrong direction
Fatherhood does not mean that as long as you are a man
you will dominate
You are the center of attention
In today's society, most men are actually working class
Just like the male protagonist of Sandow Monkey, they all suffer in order to make a living.
But boys don’t suffer because they are men
Rather, he suffers from being a "real man" who participates in patriarchy but fails to meet the expectations of patriarchy.
Women are different. They are oppressed by patriarchy just because they are women.
So we have to clarify this first:
Just because men feel pain and do not feel advantages does not mean that patriarchy does not exist
If we admit the existence of paternity, we then have to ask
Why is human society patriarchal?
There is a very common view that says
Patriarchal society stems from the fact that men and women are inherently different
Since ancient times, women have taken care of children
Man hunting outside
Tribal wars were frequent in ancient times
Boys must use violence to protect their families and country
So it evolved over a long period of time
Women become gentle and considerate
Men evolved into hunters, competitors, and family protector warriors.
So in modern society, it is natural for women to do housework
Men make money to support their families
Gender differences are a product of nature
Not some patriarchal oppression
This view that emphasizes the nature of men and women is called essentialism
In fact, it was eliminated by the anthropological community after the 1980s.
Because archaeologists have found evidence to the contrary
About 7000 BC
Beliefs in the Mother Goddess are found all over the world
The most famous one is Çatalhöyük in Türkiye
This belief in the Mother Goddess emphasizes the mysterious connection between mother and nature.
It’s something that men don’t have
Like a woman’s body having menstruation
It seems to match the waxing and waning of the moon
woman after pregnancy
The new life will be connected to the mother by the umbilical cord
These are things that men’s bodies don’t have and can’t understand.
The society at that time worshiped this feminine power
But archaeologists discovered
They are not a matriarchal society, but an egalitarian society
Just mother-centered
to imagine how to develop equal interpersonal relationships
For example, although the woman's grave is located in the center
But there are as many burial objects as men
Historian Riane Eisler even found
On the island of Crete during the mother goddess belief stage
No military defense buildings found
It means that there may not be war relations between the tribes at this time.
Rather, we advocate an equal partnership
But if human society started with a belief in the Mother Goddess
Why did it later transform into a patriarchal society?
archaeologists discovered
The earliest patriarchal society in human history, it was also the first society to raise livestock for a living.
Represents the "origin of fatherhood" related to "domesticated animals"
Because when animals become livestock
Reproduction begins to have economic value
The more children you have, the more valuable you are
This logic of looking at animals can also be applied to women
Women give birth to more children
The more labor the family has to devote to farming
So the father who controls the land no longer believes in the Mother Goddess
Because a woman’s body no longer has mysterious natural forces
Instead, it is treated as a reproductive machine
This explains why
The Mother Goddess Civilization of Crete
After the invasion of nomads from the north, it became a patriarchal society.
Because nomads introduced the dominance relationship of domesticated animals
Further changes in local gender relations
This is why
In agricultural societies that rely on labor and livestock, gender oppression also reaches its peak.
Now we find the historical roots of fatherhood
But this does not answer
Why is today’s society still patriarchal?
We must find the root of the motivation that allows each generation to continue to reproduce patriarchy
Let us start from a simple phenomenon
In a patriarchal society, men are portrayed as dominant
A real man must be aggressive and dominate the scene
Not only do you have to dominate others, you also have to dominate yourself and have self-control
Women are expected to be obedient, followers, and listeners
So in a love relationship
My girlfriend will be called Ma Zi
As if a man were a horse trainer
If any man is controlled by his girlfriend
My friends will laugh at me and call me a pony.
But why do men crave a sense of control?
It means he knows there are some things he can't control
What is something that a man cannot control?
not a woman
But other men
The reason why men want to enhance their status and sense of control
Actually, it’s because I’m afraid of being compared with other men.
Patriarchy is ostensibly the relationship between men and women
But the deeper driving force of paternity
In fact, it comes from the relationship between men
The sense of competition between men and the fear of losing to other men
Men must strengthen their dominance
In ancient tribal societies
Men are afraid that men from other tribes will invade their society
Steal your women and children
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Do not be coy or stupid Persian you can afford neither in Sparta.</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Do not be coy or stupid Persian you can afford neither in Sparta. < /font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Why is this woman qualified to speak when men are talking about things? </font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>What makes this woman think she can speak among men?</font>
This sense of fear drives men to establish their authority in society
A woman who can control herself
This sense of male competition also appears in contemporary war relationships
President Kennedy once told the New York Times
One of the reasons why the United States launched the Vietnam War
Because when he met with Khrushchev in 1961
Khrushchev advanced arguments that have consistently challenged U.S. dominance
Make him feel like it's a loss to a man's face
America must toughen up
Show a real man
That's why we started the Vietnam War
The same thing happened in the life of Sandao Monkey
We see the protagonist constantly showing off his new car, his girlfriend, and making his boy friends jealous
Behind it is actually the insecurity driven by patriarchy.
Men need to constantly prove to others that they are strong
So the patriarchal system creates a hierarchy
If men don't climb up and gain power
There will be other men above him
He will feel threatened
As a result, men are unwilling to show weakness and want to seize power and control their status.
This becomes the fundamental driving force of the patriarchal system
But men think they have the power
Little does he know that in the process of participating in patriarchy, he paid a huge price:
they do not know
In fact, you can develop a different relationship with a man
Don’t dare to show your vulnerable side to other men
Dare not express friendship towards same-sex people
Worried that this would threaten his masculine dignity and sense of power
In "The Incredibles"
This highlights the serious consequences of this male competitiveness.
<font color=#FFFD00FF>I just want to help you, I just want to help</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>What did you say to me in the end</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>Fly home Buddy, I will act alone</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>You broke my heart</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>But I learned a valuable lesson</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>Can’t rely on anyone</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>Especially you heroes</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>I shouldn’t have done this to you</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>I apologize</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>Look now you respect me</font>
<font color=#FFFD00FF>Because I am a threat</font>
Mr. Incredible keeps refusing help from others
Until the little boy becomes a man capable of killing him
Only then does he recognize the other party
This sense of competition even appears in private sexual situations
Men don’t enjoy the moment
Rather, they care about size, durability, and whether performance is better than other men.
Sex becomes an occasion for men to compete with other men for their masculinity
Even if a girl wants a boy, she doesn’t have to worry about her performance in bed
Boys will still care about it
Because it’s not women who really stare at men’s sexual prowess
But the patriarchal system
But the subtleties of fatherhood
It’s not just about letting men compete with men
Also let them form a private alliance
Men crave affirmation of their masculinity from other men
If only the woman affirms you
But other men criticize you
You will think that you are not man enough
This is why many sex education programs continue to promote
Boys can also be very feminine
You can also play girls’ games
Such advocacy often does not reduce gender-based bullying in schools
Because in the process of growing up as a man
"What you should do to be like a man" is determined by patriarchal culture
rather than being decided by teacher education
Make sure you are a real man
It must be affirmed by the male group
So in Mulan
Hua Mulan was laughed at in the military camp at first
But when she learns to do what other men are doing
She starts to gain respect from other men
Boys doubt that they are not manly enough
usually from other men's stares
rather than a woman
This is why boys use sports, fraternities, and career achievements to prove themselves
These are all shown to the male group
So the patriarchal structure actually involves the relationship between men
The role of girls is more like an intermediary tool between men
For example
What does it take for a man to be seen as a winner by other men?
very simple
Fighting for and acquiring a woman is the mark of a successful man
Patriarchal society reduces women to men’s sexual assets
Causes men to only see women’s appearance
Can’t see women’s other abilities
<font color=#F4FF00FF>But you're very beautiful.</font>
<font color=#F4FF00FF>But you're very beautiful.</font>
<font color=#F4FF00FF>Oh
screw beautiful. I'm brilliant.</font>
<font color=#F4FF00FF>If you want to appease me, compliment my brain.</font>
<font color=#F4FF00FF>If you want to appease me, compliment my brain.</font>
<font color=#F4FF00FF>I like her intelligence</font>
<font color=#F4FF00FF>Have your own opinions</font>
If a woman is not interested in a man, she is violating the rules of patriarchy.
People will say that this woman cannot achieve true happiness
It seems that you must have a partner of the opposite sex to be happy
Or further pathologize homosexuality and asexuality
Have they suffered any trauma?
Do you need to see psychological counseling?
It seems that if you are not heterosexual, your life is incomplete and flawed.
This is actually a kind of heterosexual hegemony
Presuming everyone should be heterosexual is part of how patriarchy works
then
Patriarchy can also use women to achieve male alliances
For example, if you make a joke about women, you can expect other men to laugh too.
to strengthen men’s friendships with other men
<font color=#FFF800FF>Why do women have breasts? </font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>Why do women have boobs?</font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>So you got
something to look at while you're talking to them.</font>
This is why homophobia happens more often to straight men
Because when straight men make jokes about women to achieve male solidarity
Homosexuals don’t laugh along and don’t participate in patriarchal interactions
This challenges the social way that straight men are accustomed to
Patriarchy can also use women to maintain the illusion of gender identity
Like making men think they are independent
Sociologist Arlie Hochschild pointed out
Patriarchy deliberately creates the image that it is a man’s responsibility to support the family.
It actually makes women financially dependent on men.
Make women obedient
<font color=#FFE600FF>I am the head of the family, I decide what I do.</font>
<font color=#FFE600FF>I am the commander of this house. I decide what I do.</font>
<font color=#FFE600FF>Quiet Woman</font>
<font color=#FFE600FF>Be quiet.</font>
<font color=#FFE600FF>Go and cook</font>
<font color=#FFE600FF>cook.</font>
When the woman makes more money
Boys will feel threatened
So when a dual-income family has children and housework to deal with,
In order not to hurt a man’s self-esteem
Usually it is the woman who gives up her career
The results of the study found
Married men are healthier than single men
Average age can lead to longer life
But the opposite is true for women
Married women are less healthy and live shorter lives than single women
Women’s lives and mental health are sacrificed
In exchange for the gender dignity of men
Patriarchy can also use women as psychological compensation for men
Because most men are actually dominated by other men at work
Lack of control at work makes them feel like less of a man
At this time, men can choose to challenge their superiors or go on strike, but the risk is too great
The risk is less and the way to regain male dignity
Just go home and be the head of the family
Find a woman to vent to
This can make a man feel
Although I am not as good as my male boss, at least I am still better than women.
It's like lower class white people
Although it is the lowest in the white world
But I can still comfort myself by saying: I am still better than people of color.
So racial discrimination helps alleviate class conflicts
The same patriarchy can use sexism to conceal class conflicts
No matter how humiliated men at the bottom of society are
Patriarchal societies allow men to vent their negative emotions on women as compensation
There is always a woman to take care of his needs when he returns home
It is precisely because patriarchy requires women to play this role
As a result, many women who have been victims of domestic violence are afraid to speak out.
Afraid of being accused of not loving family and not fulfilling responsibilities
<font color=#FFFA00FF>Stop trying to justify this
whole thing and admit you're in danger.</font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>Who ​​do you think you are talking to? </font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>Who ​​are you talking to right now?</font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>Do you know how much I earn in a year? </font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>Do you know how much I make a year?</font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>You wouldn't believe it even if I told you </font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>I mean even if i told you you wouldn't believe it.</font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>Do you know what would happen if I suddenly stopped working? </font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>Do you know what would happen if i suddenly decided to stop going into work.</font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>You clearly don't
know who you're talking to so let me clue you in.< /font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger
.</font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>I am
the one who knocks.</font>
Finally, patriarchy can also develop a culture of misogyny and give men a sense of superiority
For example, the derogatory curse words we hear about women today
Many of them were actually words of praise
For example, whore, a slut, originally refers to a lover
Bitch was originally the hunting dog of Artemis, the goddess of hunting.
The witch was originally a midwife with knowledge of herbal medicine.
Until later, when men dominated scientific knowledge
Witch has become a term used to attack women
These words originally carry the power of women
But later it turned into a negative connotation
Allowing men to feel good about themselves by derogating women
<font color=#F9FF00FF>You sissies can’t defeat me</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Oh yes</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Our vase can handle you</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>I don’t want to deal with anyone</font>
<font color=#F9FF00FF>Come on, don’t be like a woman</font>
After introducing how paternity works, we want to respond to several common doubts
Whenever feminists criticize patriarchy
Many men will retort that
You all think of boys as evil and want to beat them down!
These people are haters of men and stir up gender antagonism! Create division!
This kind of thinking confuses "system" and "individual"
Thinking about fatherhood in individualistic terms
So when I point out that women are oppressed
You just thought you were saying that men are all bad
This eliminates the need to think about the deeper social roots
If you explain things from an individualistic perspective
cannot understand the whole society
For example, if a war occurs
You just think it’s because soldiers are very violent and want to snatch resources
But in fact those who go to war
Many people cannot find jobs in society and join the military service as a last resort.
The arms dealers and political groups who really profit massively from the war are the instigators behind it.
Or do you view company layoffs from an individualistic perspective?
You will think it must be because capitalists are evil
But in fact it is the rules of the capitalist game that force capitalists to do this
Otherwise, he will lose to other competitors and be eliminated from the market.
So what you want to change is not individual capitalists
but the structure of capitalism
same
If you look at fatherhood from an individualistic perspective
You will feel that criticizing patriarchy is just calling men bad.
But “patriarchy” refers to the way the system works
So those who think feminism is man-hating may want to reflect on this.
Do you have a deep identification with the patriarchal system?
So when patriarchy is criticized, you feel like you're being attacked
The second common response is: Fatherhood has nothing to do with me
I'm different from those "scumbags" and "evil men"
I have not subjected women to domestic violence or sexual harassment
I am a man who is very considerate to girls
But we must recognize one thing
No matter how nice you are to girls
It won't change the fact that you occupy a male position
So as long as you live in a patriarchal society, you will get male privileges and patriarchal dividends to some extent.
Many boys may not feel that they have any privileges
But just because you don't realize your privilege doesn't mean you don't have it
The way privilege works is that you are entitled to take things for granted
For example, a boy goes out in the middle of the night
Don’t worry about being harassed by other boys
But girls do not enjoy this freedom from fear
Will avoid going out in the middle of the night
This sense of security is a male privilege
Or when boys are talking
Can express one's thoughts completely without being interrupted
This is also a male privilege
Sociologists conducted experiments and found
It is more common for men to interrupt women than for women to interrupt men.
And when a man interrupts a man's speech, it's usually to give encouragement and support.
But when a man interrupts a woman, he usually gives a rebuttal
<font color=#FFFF00FF>You think that
only because you don't know any better.</font>
This is something that men don’t even realize, but it happens every day.
There are also boys who can be steadily promoted in all walks of life, which is also a privilege.
Because most industries are dominated by men
It is difficult for women to get promoted and they have to face a lot of sexual harassment in the workplace
In the end, it makes it easier for women to leave their jobs and change careers.
Finally there is a privilege
It’s because men don’t need to understand gender issues
But women need to read feminism
Only then can we understand where our oppression comes from.
Hundreds of years of organizational movement must also be launched
Only then can we get the same equal rights as men
In the end, there is still a group of voices that will say:
Okay, we admit that paternity exists
But now everyone only emphasizes that women are oppressed
It’s basically the rise of women’s rights
Boys have become weak
<font color=#FFF000FF>Men start to be scared to move a certain way because you don't want to get judged or</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>You get scared to move a certain way because you don't want to get judged or</font >
<font color=#FFF000FF>or not recognized by your community</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>out of the accepted part of your community.</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>I think that kinda has us in an uproar</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>And i think that that kinda has us in an uproar</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>and we don't know where to be like where's
this safe place to be for men.</font>
Boys have to pay when they go out on a date
Boys will be treated as tools by girls
Boys need to make money to support their families, own cars and houses to be valued
These are men's dilemmas
Girls have an advantage
If we only look at the results, this is indeed the case.
But we must ask
Why do these demands on men appear?
That's because in a patriarchal society
Women are treated as men’s sexual assets
In order for women to survive in a patriarchal society
They have no choice but to use sex in exchange for wealth, power, and status
The man’s economic conditions will be magnified and displayed
It’s because in a patriarchal society
It is easier for men to obtain high positions and high salaries
<font color=#FFEB00FF>I finally got here, can I meet the woman in power, your CEO? </font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Since I came all this way, can I meet the woman in charge, your CEO?</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Oh, that would be me
.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Oh, You're CFO.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Oh, You're CFO.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Me</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Me.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>You're COO.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>You're COO.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Here
. President of the Barbie division.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>I am a man without power, so am I considered a woman? </font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>I'm the man without power, does that make me a woman.</font>
Girls have princess disease, not because girls are born with it
It's because this society is dominated by "kings" and "princes"
So get to the bottom of it
The source of men’s suffering is actually not women
But patriarchy
If we lived in a truly gender-equal society
Women are no longer targets of sexual exploitation
Men no longer have economic advantages and monopolize power.
Then boys won’t just think about possessing women
He won't be treated as a tool
Girls can also be independent
No need to find a tool man
So if you think men are suffering too
You should oppose patriarchy even more
Should become a feminist
Because your pain is caused by patriarchy
It’s not the fault of feminists
You've had the wrong enemy all along
You think women are your enemies
But in fact, fatherhood is your real enemy
Finally, the author reminds us of a very important concept
Just every time we talk about fatherhood
There will be people who compare every argument that women are oppressed with the situation of boys.
It is said that men can also be domestically abused by women.
Women also make fun of men
This statement makes sense on the surface.
In fact, it is a mistake to equate the harm suffered by men and women.
For example, after the MeToo movement, many people will use the example of Johnny Depp to defend
You see, supporting the feminist movement gets men falsely accused!
This statement only applies to a few special cases of men
Deliberately ignoring that most victims are women
In fact, it reflects that you only care about men’s interests
So as long as one man is harmed
You can ignore that the other 99% of people are women
Refuse to change the status quo of gender oppression
This is actually typical patriarchal thinking
Thinking about things from a male-centered perspective
in fact
If you are really that afraid of men, you will also be subjected to domestic violence
You should support the gender equality movement and the Me Too movement
Encourage victimized men to come forward and speak out about their experiences
Oppose any form of gender oppression
rather than against the me too movement
Next, it’s time to talk about discriminatory jokes
Many people will say that men are also laughed at by women.
But actually
Any derogatory stereotype or joke about men
Just to make everyone laugh
It will not really undermine the interests of collective men.
The entire society is still dominated by men who hold most of the power
The loudest ones are still the men.
Women are still more vulnerable to sexual harassment and pornographic remarks
Compared to jokes that discriminate against men
Misogynistic jokes hurt more
Because these discriminations will strengthen patriarchal dominance
But a joke that discriminates against men
It doesn’t really challenge the father’s authority
Just the opposite
When girls use gender issues to mock boys
The logic behind these jokes is usually that men have deviated from society’s expectations of a “real man.”
When masculinity disappears, it becomes funny and funny
So these jokes that make fun of boys
On the contrary, it proves that we live in a patriarchal society
Rather than the rise of women’s rights
Finally, there is a false gender equivalence that says:
If we demand gender equality, why don’t girls serve in the military?
It’s basically a feminist buffet
This statement gets two things wrong
First of all, it is not because women oppress men that men should serve as soldiers on the battlefield.
It is the ruling class and military leaders who legislate military service and assign men to fight.
So military service is actually about upper-class men controlling lower-class men to serve as cannon fodder.
For example, 80% of the soldiers in the Vietnam War were men from the lower working class.
If a man finds it painful to be a soldier
You should point your guns at the ruling class and the country, not women
Many feminists actually side with men
I think the country should not force boys to serve as soldiers
Because military service often inflicts violence on men
Being in the military is a painful memory for many boys.
So does "only boys have to serve in the military" discriminate against men?
yes
There is no reason why a man should be tortured by the state's military
true gender equality
It’s not that girls are required to join the army and be abused too.
but regardless of gender
Neither men nor women should be forced by the state to serve as soldiers
In today's video, we introduce the history and operation of fatherhood.
There are also various sources of male dilemmas.
Not from women, but from patriarchy
So how do we dismantle the patriarchal structures that impact us every day?
We can emulate the 20th century feminist movement
These movements all originated from consciousness-raising groups
Originally it was just girls getting together to gossip.
Talk about trauma in your life
It turned out that everyone had a similar experience
Only then did I realize that the pain in life is not a personal problem
It’s a collective social problem
There must be a collective solution
Then take the initiative to read and understand the operation of the patriarchal system
After understanding how patriarchy oppresses women and men
We can think about how to respond to various patriarchal oppressions in our lives
When someone tells a misogynistic joke, do I laugh or not?
Because if no one laughs, a joke doesn’t constitute a joke
when group conversations
Are all the boys speaking, leaving no room for women to speak?
Do women often get interrupted by men when they are speaking, and then their attention is drawn back to them?
Actively listen to the female relatives and friends around you
Have you experienced discrimination or harassment?
Take the initiative to care for students with different gender temperaments on campus
Have you ever experienced being excluded or bullied?

In a conversation with a male friend
How much of it is about competing with each other instead of actually caring about each other?
How long has it been since you took the initiative to care about your male friends?

When we proactively change the way we engage in fatherhood
It's about showing other people another possibility.
Let them see that they don’t have to compete with other men or see men as threats.
There is no need to belittle people of different genders or sexual orientations
You can also live a complete and fulfilling life
To show such a possibility is to dismantle patriarchy
