We have a channel that's a constant feed where basically every time a customer call is done, it just pops up on Slack. We have 300 employees are a company and I'm really able to get a sense of the pulse of the company, what customers care about just based upon looking at something like this. I'm going to open Slack right now and you can see here this in the sample call and it shows who the key stakeholders were, what the call attempted to establish, what was the sentiment score, gotten an A, opportunities for upselling, feedback, and next steps and it has basically a transcript here and it's great for us to do. If a customer is not happy, if they for some reason score below a seven, we have a churn notification chow where basically it's called churn early warning system, where it'll tell us if a customer is not happy for whatever reason. And we've had to modulate it because sometimes they'll say the client's not happy, but maybe they're just not happy with how their business is going. So it's not always like a science. Sometimes the rep might not want to tell anybody. Maybe it's a Friday afternoon, they just don't want to deal with it. And then what happens if we end up forgetting about it, and then the customer churns three months later, and we're like, why do you just tell us? We don't have to do that anymore. We don't have to ask somebody how that call went with Proctor and Gamble. It's just here.
