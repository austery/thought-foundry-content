>> Hello
 and
 welcome
 to
 another
 episode
 of


the
 Odd
 Thoughts
 podcast.
 I'm
 Tracy


Aloway


>> and
 I'm
 Joe
 Wisenthal.


>> Joe,
 I
 kind
 of
 missed
 this
 on
 Friday


because
 I
 was
 not
 feeling
 very
 well.
 So


I
 I
 was
 out
 sick.
 But
 uh
 what
 was
 Friday


morning
 like
 when
 you
 were
 sat
 in
 front


of
 your
 Bloomberg
 terminal?


>> Well,
 the
 jobs
 report
 was
 pretty
 uh


shocking.
 Obvious
 Friday
 was
 just
 a


crazy
 day.
 I
 mean
 so
 the
 jobs
 report


obviously
 was
 it
 was
 it
 was
 bad.
 I
 mean


the
 last
 two
 months
 massively
 revised


down.
 All
 of
 this
 evidence
 of
 labor


market
 momentum
 perhaps
 seems
 to
 be


stalling.
 The
 tariff
 effect
 maybe
 we


really
 are
 and
 it's
 sort
 of
 some
 sort
 of


tariff
 induced
 slowdown.
 The
 only
 job


creation
 is
 in
 healthcare
 and
 social


service.
 Not
 great,


>> right?
 Okay.
 So,
 I
 saw
 the
 initial
 jobs


report
 headlines.
 So,
 we
 had
 non-farm


payrolls
 coming
 in
 at
 plus
 73,000,
 which


I
 think
 was
 like
 30%
 lower
 than
 the


average
 expectation.
 We
 had
 the


unemployment
 rate
 ticking
 up
 to
 like


4.3%


>> 4.2


>> 4
 almost
 4.3%.


>> Oh.
 Oh,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 Sorry.


>> I'm
 rounding
 up
 here.


>> Okay.
 Okay.
 Okay.
 Although
 maybe
 I


shouldn't
 do
 that
 on
 a
 podcast
 all
 about


labor
 market
 statistics.
 But
 the
 big


thing
 that
 seemed
 to
 catch
 everyone's


attention
 was
 we
 also
 had
 these
 massive


revisions
 to
 the
 report
 for
 May
 and


June.
 So
 we
 had
 a
 combined
 258,000


jobs
 basically
 lowered
 from
 the
 initial


reports.
 And
 this
 was
 like
 the
 biggest


revision
 since
 the
 depths
 of
 the


pandemic.
 And
 then
 the
 headline
 that


really
 caught
 my
 eye
 while
 I
 was,
 you


know,
 laying
 in
 my
 sick
 bed
 on
 Friday


afternoon
 was
 Trump
 firing
 the
 head
 of


the
 Bureau
 of
 Labor
 Statistics.
 So
 the


agency
 responsible
 for
 putting
 out
 the


non-farm
 payroll
 report
 every
 month.


>> Yeah,
 this
 is
 um
 I
 would
 say
 the
 key


thing
 is
 that
 a
 we've
 been
 used
 to
 these


uh
 you
 know
 seeing
 significant


revisions.
 We've
 been
 talking,
 you
 in


particular
 have
 been
 writing
 a
 lot
 in


the
 newsletter
 about
 deteriorating


quality
 of
 labor
 statistics.
 Response


rates
 to
 a
 lot
 of
 surveys
 have
 gone
 down


over
 time.
 Kind
 of
 like
 we're
 seeing
 in


political
 opinion
 surveys
 and
 so
 forth.


So
 there's
 already
 been
 this
 sort
 of


anxiety.
 You
 have
 a
 lot
 of
 people


online,
 including
 President
 Trump


himself,
 you
 know,
 been
 like
 stoking


sort
 of
 these
 conspiracy
 theories
 about


these
 revisions,
 these
 attempts
 to


actually
 be
 transparent.
 And
 then
 you


get
 the
 first
 sort
 of
 like
 genuinely


negative
 report
 under
 this


administration.
 It's
 the
 first
 one
 that


was
 like,
 "Okay,
 this
 was
 bad."
 And


boom,
 Trump
 fires
 uh
 the
 person


responsible
 for
 it.
 Now,
 again,
 this
 is


one
 of
 those
 things
 where
 sort
 of
 like


Doge
 itself
 where
 it's
 like,
 I
 like
 the


idea
 of
 government
 efficiency,
 right?


Yeah,
 sure.
 Doge,
 I
 like
 the
 idea
 of
 the


BLS
 sort
 of
 doing
 a
 better
 job
 in
 some


way
 or
 addressing
 these
 responses,
 but


like
 Doge,
 which
 you
 know,
 we
 all
 have


seen
 how
 that's
 turned
 out.
 I
 think


there
 are
 a
 lot
 of
 more
 than
 a
 lot
 of


questions
 more
 than
 a
 lot
 of
 questions


about
 whether
 firing
 the
 BLS
 and


replacing
 the
 head
 with
 someone
 who's
 uh


you
 know
 a
 Trump
 appointee
 will
 uh
 you


know
 add
 a
 more
 credible
 transparent


data
 quality.


>> Right.
 One
 thing
 that
 we
 have
 learned


from
 all
 our
 episodes
 on
 data
 collection


in
 the
 US
 is
 that
 it
 is
 actually
 a


really
 really
 insanely
 laborintensive


thing
 to
 do.
 you
 have
 to
 actually
 call


up
 a
 bunch
 of
 people,
 um,
 homeowners
 for


instance,
 or
 you
 have
 to
 call
 up
 a
 bunch


of
 businesses
 and
 ask
 questions.
 You


have
 to
 go
 out
 into
 the
 field
 and
 gather


individual
 prices.
 And
 we
 can
 have
 a


debate
 over
 whether
 or
 not
 you
 could


maybe
 use
 new
 technology,
 price
 scanning


data
 to
 make
 all
 of
 that
 more
 efficient.


But
 for
 the
 time
 being,
 that's
 how
 it's


done.
 And
 so,
 you
 need
 people
 to
 do
 it.


And
 if
 Doge
 comes
 in
 and
 eliminates,
 you


know,
 a
 big
 chunk
 of
 the
 budget,
 then
 it


becomes
 harder
 to
 do.
 or
 if
 it
 just
 gets


more
 costly
 and
 the
 budget's
 gone
 up.


And
 then
 the
 one
 thing
 I
 would
 say
 is


that
 in
 our
 conversations
 and
 again
 you


have
 talked
 to
 the
 BLS
 many
 times
 they


are
 really
 good.
 They
 are
 professionals


and
 they
 take
 it
 very
 seriously.


>> They
 are
 very
 responsive.
 However,


>> very
 transparent.


>> We
 could
 talk
 about
 this
 a
 little
 bit


but
 perhaps
 less
 responsive
 than
 they


used
 to
 be
 in
 recent
 weeks.
 So
 anyway,


we
 should
 talk
 about
 all
 of
 this.
 I


think
 it's
 really
 important
 and
 as
 you


said
 there
 are
 big
 questions
 like
 what


happens
 if
 a
 president
 ousts
 a
 BLS
 chief


and
 then
 introduces
 a
 new
 one.
 We
 have


the
 perfect
 guest
 someone
 we've
 spoken


to
 before
 about
 the
 decline
 of
 America's


data
 infrastructure.
 We're
 going
 to
 be


speaking
 with
 Bill
 Beachch.
 He
 is
 of


course
 the
 former
 commissioner
 of
 labor


statistics,
 former
 head
 of
 the
 BLS.
 So


Bill,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 coming
 back


on
 All
 Thoughts.


>> Yeah,
 it's
 just just
 really
 a
 pleasure


to
 be
 back
 with
 you.
 I
 wish
 we
 uh
 were


talking
 about
 some
 other
 subject
 besides


this
 termination.
 I
 mean,
 it's
 just


really


>> shock.
 Well,
 on
 that
 note,
 Friday
 uh


Trump
 tweets
 or
 posts
 that
 he
 wants
 to


fire
 Erica
 McNurfer,
 the
 commissioner
 of


labor
 statistics.
 What
 was
 going
 through


your
 mind
 when
 you
 saw
 that
 news?


>> I
 was
 dumbass.
 I
 just
 finished
 a
 lunchon


meeting
 at
 a
 very
 nice
 restaurant
 and
 I


was
 sitting
 in
 my
 pickup
 truck
 and
 I


just
 couldn't
 believe
 and
 then
 I
 sat


there
 for
 probably
 30
 40
 minutes
 car


running
 and
 answering
 emails
 people
 just


sorting
 it
 out.
 It
 isn't
 that
 he
 didn't


have
 the
 authority
 to
 do
 so.
 He
 does


have
 the
 authority
 and
 we
 all,
 you
 know,


everyone
 in
 the
 executive
 branch
 serves


at
 the
 pleasure
 of
 the
 president
 except


those
 that
 have
 been
 specifically


exempted
 by
 statute
 and
 and
 where
 that


statute's
 been
 signed
 by
 the
 president.


I
 think
 what
 was
 shocking
 about
 this
 is


not
 that
 she
 was
 dismissed.
 That's


shocking
 enough.
 It
 was
 the
 possibility


that
 we
 could
 have
 now
 a
 sustained


attack
 on
 official
 economic
 statistics


and
 that
 would
 undermine
 confidence
 in


those
 statistics
 and
 put
 us
 in
 a
 path


that
 other
 countries
 have
 followed.
 I


mean
 instantly
 people
 went
 to
 worst


case.
 After
 a
 while
 that
 sort
 of
 settled


down
 and
 we
 began
 to
 look
 at
 the
 reasons


for
 for
 the
 dismissal
 which
 I
 then


subsequently
 said
 on
 Twitter
 or
 X
 that


were
 they
 were
 they
 were
 unfounded
 and
 I


haven't
 dropped
 that
 that
 position


since.
 So
 happy
 to
 talk
 about
 it.


>> Well,
 why
 don't
 we
 just
 back
 up
 for
 a


second?
 We
 talked
 to
 you
 before
 cuz


you've
 been
 sounding
 the
 alarm
 about
 the


capacity
 constraints
 to
 collect
 good


data.
 But
 just
 for
 people
 who
 haven't


listened
 to
 or
 haven't
 followed
 you,
 you


were
 a
 Trump
 appointee.
 I
 mean,
 you


served
 at
 the
 head
 of
 the
 BLS
 in
 2017.


And
 so
 I
 do,
 you
 know,
 and
 so
 like,


okay,
 your
 credibility,
 why
 don't
 you


just
 give
 us
 a
 little
 bit
 of
 background


about
 who
 you
 are,
 your
 position,
 and


the
 concerns
 that
 you've
 been
 raising


for
 some
 time
 about
 the
 constraints
 at


the
 BLS?
 So,
 I
 was
 uh
 I
 was
 really


honored
 to
 be
 the
 commissioner
 of
 labor


statistics
 from
 2019
 until
 2023.
 So,
 I


served
 a
 little
 less
 than
 two
 years


under
 President
 Trump.
 He
 nominated
 me.


It
 is
 a
 presidential
 nomination,
 Senate


confirmed
 positions.
 It
 has
 a
 statutory


four-year
 term.
 And
 then
 I
 served
 the


rest
 of
 my
 term
 under
 President
 Biden.


So,
 I
 I
 was
 in
 both
 terms.
 I
 I
 think


that's
 kind
 of
 important
 because
 the
 BLS


commissioner
 has
 been
 exempt
 from
 the


normal
 turning
 over
 of
 the
 presidency
 by


party
 and
 that's
 because
 the
 view
 is


well
 these
 data
 are
 so
 important
 they


should
 not
 even
 be
 a
 part
 of
 the


political
 appointment
 process
 except


when
 they
 come
 due
 sort
 of
 like
 u
 you


know
 the
 Federal
 Reserve
 chair
 or


something
 of
 that
 nature.
 It's
 just
 seen


as
 we
 want
 to
 keep
 it
 out
 of
 politics.


So
 I
 I
 served
 over
 that
 period
 of
 time.


You
 know,
 that
 was
 the
 COVID
 period.
 So


there
 were
 all
 kinds
 of
 real
 challenges


from
 that.
 But
 I
 think
 the
 main
 thing


that
 I
 drew
 from
 that
 period
 is
 how


important
 it
 is
 crucial
 almost
 at
 a


crisis
 level
 to
 modernize
 the
 way
 we


collect
 data.
 The
 response
 rates
 on
 the


surveys
 are
 falling
 dramatically.
 I've


made
 that
 point
 on
 this
 program.
 and
 our


costs
 are
 rising
 dramatically
 which


makes
 it
 really
 difficult
 to
 conduct


those
 surveys
 in
 the
 future
 in
 the
 way


we
 have
 in
 the
 past
 and
 then
 the
 future


is
 a
 kind
 of
 a
 going
 in
 the
 direction
 of


the
 employment
 survey
 and
 I
 just
 said


surveys
 are
 are
 are
 following
 but
 the


employment
 survey
 is
 a
 little
 different


it's
 not
 an
 in-person
 survey
 it
 is
 an


electronic
 survey
 and
 we
 need
 to
 invest


more
 in
 the
 electronic
 side
 of


statistical
 creation
 or
 production


blended
 data
 etc
 I
 could
 do
 a
 program
 on


this,
 but
 your
 your
 point
 was
 well
 made.


BLS
 has
 had
 some
 challenges
 in
 front
 of


it,
 as
 has
 the
 entire
 statistical


system.
 Unfortunately,
 for
 this


particular
 episode,
 those
 challenges


were
 really
 not
 I
 don't
 say
 relevant.


They
 they're
 relevant,
 of
 course,
 but


they're
 really
 not
 the
 reason
 why
 we


should
 have
 had
 a
 a
 change
 at
 the
 top.
 H


well
 speaking
 of
 the
 employment
 report


talk
 to
 us
 about
 what
 exactly
 happens


when
 the
 BLS
 is
 publishing
 the
 initial


non-farm
 payrolls
 and
 then
 what
 happens


you
 know
 in
 the
 couple
 months
 or
 so


before
 it
 publishes
 the
 revision
 and
 why


does
 it
 seem
 we
 are
 getting
 these
 large


gaps
 at least
 in
 recent
 months
 and
 years


>> right
 so
 the
 employment
 survey
 the
 jobs


numbers
 come
 from
 a
 survey
 of
 businesses


uh
 the
 unemployment
 rate
 comes
 from
 a


survey
 of
 households.
 So
 there's
 two


surveys
 involved
 in
 every
 first
 Friday


report.
 What
 we're
 talking
 about
 now
 is


the
 survey
 that
 goes
 out
 to
 businesses


and
 it
 goes
 out
 to
 hundreds
 of
 thousands


of
 businesses.
 Well,
 of
 course
 there


still
 a
 probability
 sample
 since
 there's


well
 in
 excess
 of
 12
 million
 businesses


in
 our
 census
 of
 business,
 our
 business


register.
 Well,
 those
 businesses
 are


supposed
 to
 turn
 their
 surveys
 in
 at
 the


end
 of
 the
 month
 basically,
 but
 only


about
 68%
 usually
 that's
 the
 average
 do


so.
 And
 so
 BLS
 keeps
 the
 window
 open
 for


two
 more
 months.
 So
 68%
 or
 so
 at
 the
 end


of
 the
 first
 month
 they
 make
 the
 first


estimate.
 Then
 at
 the
 end
 of
 the
 second


month,
 we've
 get
 about
 83%


completion
 and
 they
 revise
 that
 number


of
 the
 first
 month.
 And
 then
 by
 the


third
 month
 we're
 into
 the
 90s.
 Usually


end
 up
 around
 93
 94%
 of
 all
 the
 sent
 out


returns
 come
 back
 to
 us
 with


information.
 So
 it's
 a
 wonderful
 survey.


The
 revisions
 are
 done
 because
 we
 get


more
 information
 from
 businesses.
 Often


times
 big
 businesses
 answer
 first.
 They


have
 the
 capacity
 to
 do
 so
 and
 then
 we


get
 smaller
 entities,
 state
 and
 local


governments.
 Smaller
 businesses
 answer


in
 those
 next
 two
 months.
 We
 always
 have


revisions.
 There's
 there's
 I
 can't
 I


can't
 imag
 even
 when
 it
 when
 we
 say
 the


number
 did
 not
 change
 it
 doesn't
 mean
 we


we
 didn't
 have
 revisions
 they
 just


canceled
 each
 other
 out.
 There's
 just


all
 these
 revisions
 are
 coming
 in.
 The


revisions
 have
 been
 uh
 high
 recently
 but


this
 is
 not
 atypical
 of
 a
 period
 when


the
 economy
 is
 either
 going
 back
 to


growth
 or
 going
 down
 to
 subsidance.
 So


often
 times
 turning
 points
 in
 the


economy
 are
 accompanied
 by
 changes


larger
 changes
 in
 the
 revisions


particularly
 in
 this
 case
 where
 we


suspect
 smaller
 businesses
 are
 feeling


the
 effects
 of
 the
 supply
 shock
 coming


from
 the
 tariff
 policy
 and
 from


immigration
 and
 that
 these
 supply
 shocks


are
 affecting
 smaller
 businesses
 more


than
 they
 are
 larger
 businesses
 and


state
 and
 local
 governments
 are
 being


affected
 by
 yet
 another
 factor
 and
 that


is
 the
 expiration
 of
 the
 co
 era
 money.
 I


think
 that's
 was
 actually
 the
 root
 of
 a


lot
 of
 the
 changes
 that
 you
 saw
 on


Friday.
 State
 and
 local
 governments
 are


not
 able
 to
 to
 hire
 at
 the
 levels
 they


were
 going
 to
 hire
 at
 in
 previous
 years


or
 did
 hire
 at
 in
 previous
 years
 because


they
 did
 not
 have
 the
 subsidies
 that


they
 had
 in
 previous
 years.
 So,
 these


are
 important
 revisions.
 Actually,
 the


research
 shows,
 and
 this
 may
 shock
 you,


that
 BLS
 is
 getting
 much
 better
 at
 its


first
 estimate
 than
 it
 was
 30
 years
 ago.


In
 fact,
 it's
 really
 kind
 of
 almost
 a
 a


steady
 progress
 towards
 greater


accuracy.
 So,
 the
 big
 revisions
 are


indicative
 of
 not
 air,
 they're


indicative
 of
 more
 information.
 And
 the


bigger
 the
 revisions,
 the
 more
 likely
 we


are
 in
 a
 turning
 point.
 There's
 so
 much


that
 was
 in
 that
 answer
 that
 I
 found
 to


be
 very
 helpful
 and
 clarifying.
 So,


thank
 you.
 I
 mean,
 just
 this
 idea,
 you


know,
 a
 that
 actually
 over
 time,


contrary
 to
 what
 people
 on
 Twitter
 might


think,
 that
 the
 quality
 of
 that
 first


pass
 has
 actually
 gone
 up
 is
 uh
 um
 is


very
 striking.
 You
 know,
 let's
 stipulate


that.
 Okay,
 the
 BLS
 could
 use
 some


upgrading
 as
 you
 mentioned
 that
 there


are
 these
 capacity
 constraints,


non-response,
 the
 cost
 of
 going
 out,


maybe
 it
 needs
 to
 adopt
 more
 technology


in
 some
 way
 to
 solve
 for
 this.
 Does
 the


BLS
 currently
 have
 that
 capacity
 either


budgetarywise
 or
 statutory
 authority


such
 that
 a
 commissioner
 could
 just
 do


that
 whatever
 it
 is
 that
 ideal
 state
 or


would
 it
 need
 either
 some
 sort
 of


budgetary
 allocation
 or
 an
 act
 of


Congress
 to
 get
 to
 the
 point
 where
 it's


you
 know
 getting
 to
 the
 level
 that
 we


are
 happy
 with
 again


>> it
 has
 the
 authority
 to
 make
 the
 changes


it
 doesn't
 have
 the
 budget
 to
 do
 so
 and


it
 isn't
 that
 BLS
 just
 needs
 more
 money


I
 matter
 of
 fact
 I
 think
 Congress
 if
 it


paid
 more
 attention
 would
 say
 well
 what


are
 you
 spending
 your
 money
 on
 now
 and


let's
 make
 sure
 that
 the
 low
 priority
 is


cancelled
 so
 that
 we
 can
 support
 the


high
 priority
 I
 think
 BLS
 would
 be
 very


happy
 with
 that
 but
 we
 do
 need
 more


money
 and
 why
 well
 if
 you're
 going
 to


change
 an
 official
 statistic
 the


unemployment
 rate
 let's
 just
 take
 that


you
 want
 to
 be
 really
 careful
 right
 you


want
 to
 run
 tests
 you
 want
 to
 test
 out


your
 new
 idea
 you
 don't
 want
 to
 have
 a


you


count
 the
 number
 of
 geese
 in
 the
 air
 and


that's
 the
 unemployment
 rate.
 You
 want


to
 make
 sure
 that
 that
 is
 a
 particularly


good
 indicator
 of
 the
 employment
 market


and
 you
 want
 to
 test
 it
 in
 real
 time
 as


well
 as
 experimental
 time
 in
 real
 time.


So
 run
 it
 parallel.
 Well,
 the
 these


these
 tests
 expand
 the
 costs
 of
 your


unemployment
 statistics
 program
 because


you're
 running
 essentially
 two
 systems


simultaneously.


We
 think
 that
 to
 modify
 the
 current


population
 survey,
 which
 is
 the
 survey


of
 households,
 would
 cost
 around
 15


million
 to
 20
 million
 in
 experimental


costs
 over
 a
 2-year
 period.
 It's
 not


great.
 The
 program
 itself
 costs
 about
 45


million
 a
 year,


>> but
 it
 does
 add
 to
 the
 cost
 for
 those


two
 years
 or
 so.
 Congress
 could
 could


easily
 do
 that.
 I
 mean,
 oh
 my
 gosh,


Congress
 is
 spending
 a
 lot
 more
 money


than
 that
 on
 things
 that
 we
 might


disagree
 with,
 but
 they
 need
 to
 allocate


a
 little
 bit
 of
 money
 to
 CPS
 for
 that.


Does
 it
 have
 the
 authority?
 Here's
 a


really
 interesting
 story.
 During
 COVID,


we
 canled
 all
 travel,
 all
 conferences,


you
 know,
 was
 and
 I
 was
 surprised
 at
 how


many
 millions
 of
 dollars
 went
 into


travel
 and
 conferences
 and
 meetings.
 So,


this
 became
 for
 me
 couch
 money
 during


the
 co
 years.
 And
 I
 was
 able
 to
 spend


that
 money
 um
 you
 know
 on
 on
 important


things
 I
 thought.
 So
 I
 did
 a
 lot
 of


things
 like
 I
 built
 a
 new
 data
 center
 to


get
 us
 out
 of
 the
 basement
 of
 a
 104
 year


old
 building


>> and
 out
 to
 a
 wonderful
 above
 ground


local
 location
 but
 I
 also
 started
 a


number
 of
 research
 programs
 and
 I
 made


31
 big
 modifications
 to
 the
 to
 the
 CPI.


We
 started
 a
 whole
 new
 approach
 on
 on


looking
 at
 consumer
 expenditures
 and
 I


subsidized
 some
 experimentation
 on
 the


jobs
 report.
 Well,
 as
 soon
 as
 CO
 was


over,
 we
 started
 to
 get
 congressionally


mandated
 programs
 that
 then
 sucked
 up


all
 that
 couch
 money.
 If
 we
 had
 a
 little


bit
 of
 extra,
 we
 I
 mean
 BLS,
 a
 little


bit
 of
 extra
 to
 do
 these
 these
 things,


just
 just
 think
 of
 the
 innovation
 that


that
 would
 happen.
 I
 think
 we
 would


quickly
 be
 out
 of
 the
 problems
 that
 we


are
 facing
 from
 a
 methodological


standpoint.
 And
 that
 might
 then
 reduce


the
 political
 pressure
 that
 we
 saw
 that


was
 so
 evident
 on
 Friday.


>> So,
 we
 are
 recording
 this
 August
 4th,


9:25
 a.m.
 in
 the
 morning
 and
 33
 seconds.


I
 feel
 like
 I
 need
 to
 be
 that
 specific


nowadays
 with
 the
 news
 flow.
 Uh,
 so
 who


knows
 what
 happens
 between
 now
 and
 when


this
 episode
 actually
 comes
 out,
 but
 we


are
 expecting
 the
 administration
 to


announce
 a
 new
 BLS
 head
 in
 the
 coming


days.
 What
 happens
 now?
 You
 know,
 if


there's
 a
 Trump
 appointee
 for
 a
 new


statistics
 commissioner
 after
 the


president
 has
 specifically
 stated
 that


he
 thinks
 the
 previous
 commissioner
 was


politically
 motivated
 in
 some
 way,
 are


people
 still
 going
 to
 believe
 the


numbers
 that
 are
 coming
 out?
 And
 how
 do


you
 think
 that's
 actually
 going
 to
 play


internally
 at
 the
 BLS
 at
 an
 organization


whose
 whole,
 you
 know,
 raise
 on
 Dutch
 is


to
 find,
 you
 know,
 factual
 numbers
 and


statistics
 to
 portray
 the
 American


economy?


>> Well,
 I
 think
 there
 has
 been
 damage
 and


it
 will
 take
 time
 to
 recover
 from
 that


damage.
 The
 last
 time
 there
 was
 a


serious
 political
 effort
 on
 BLS
 was


during
 the
 Nixon
 administration
 and
 um


it
 took
 some
 time
 for
 BLS
 to
 recover


from
 that
 though
 the
 action
 taken
 by
 the


president
 at
 that
 time
 visav
 BLS
 was
 not


I
 think
 as
 as
 significant
 as
 this
 one.


So
 you
 just
 imagine
 that
 the
 president


decides
 to
 no
 appointment
 St.
 Peter
 you


know
 as
 the
 new
 BLS
 commissioner
 and
 of


course
 St.
 Peter
 has
 a
 reputation
 for


honesty
 and
 for
 clarity
 of
 thought.


Still,
 it'll
 be
 the
 case
 because
 St.


Peter
 won't
 have
 any
 control
 over
 the


way
 that
 the
 data
 are
 collected
 or
 the


data
 are
 assembled
 or
 the
 estimates
 that


are
 done.
 That's
 all
 done
 outside
 of
 the


of
 the
 knowledge
 of
 the
 commissioner.


Commissioner
 has
 no
 control
 over
 that.


In
 fact,
 you're
 locked
 out
 of
 that
 whole


process.
 So,
 it
 will
 be
 the
 case
 that


St.
 Peter
 will
 have
 a
 month
 come
 when


the
 unemployment
 rate
 will
 be


disappointingly
 low,
 could
 even
 be


negative.
 But
 I
 think
 given
 what
 has


just
 happened,
 people
 will
 say,
 well,


St.
 Peter
 probably
 influenced
 that


number
 and
 it's
 not
 as
 bad
 as
 it
 really


is.
 So
 for
 a
 while,
 that
 suspicion
 that


the
 estimate
 that's
 announced
 is
 really


not
 the
 real
 estimate
 will
 be
 in
 the


minds
 of
 some
 people.
 Not
 in
 my
 mind


because
 I
 know
 that
 these
 people
 who


work
 there,
 the
 professionals,
 the


full-time
 staff,
 the
 patriots
 that
 that


work
 there,
 the
 the
 the
 loyal
 Americans


who
 are
 just
 extremely
 diligent
 in
 doing


an
 absolutely
 objective
 job,
 those


people
 are
 still
 in
 place.
 But
 if
 you


don't
 have
 my
 level
 of
 knowledge
 or
 a


reasonable
 level
 of
 knowledge
 of
 how


internally
 BLS
 works,
 you're
 going
 to
 be


subject
 to
 these
 falsehoods
 and


accusations
 and
 that
 will
 be
 damaging.


that
 will
 reduce
 investment
 that
 will


reduce
 economic
 activity
 that
 will
 make


at
 at
 least
 that
 will
 create
 greater


uncertainty
 about
 what's
 happening


inside
 the
 US
 economy
 policy
 makers
 will


be
 less
 less
 clear
 in
 the
 direction
 that


they
 take
 so
 that
 there
 will
 be
 a
 time


when
 we
 need
 to
 recover
 no matter
 who's


appointed
 I
 hope
 that
 it
 will
 be
 a


short-lived
 time
 and
 my
 guess
 is
 given


the
 reputation
 of
 BLS
 if
 someone
 you


know
 really
 reputable
 is
 appointed
 then


yeah
 I
 don't
 I
 think
 the
 period
 of


transition
 will
 be
 that
 long.


>> All
 right.
 Well,
 Bill
 Beach,
 really


appreciate
 you
 coming
 back
 on
 the
 show.


Uh,
 thank
 you
 so
 much
 for
 for
 being
 on.


>> Thanks,
 Bill.
 That
 was
 great.


>> Oh,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 asking
 me.


[Music]


>> Joe,
 so
 good
 to
 get
 Bill
 back
 on
 to
 talk


about
 this.
 Really
 the
 perfect
 guest.


There
 are
 so
 many
 I
 guess
 ironies


involved
 in
 this
 whole
 conversation.
 The


big
 one
 of
 course
 is
 this
 idea
 that
 like


well
 if
 Trump
 wants
 to
 convince
 everyone


that
 the
 US
 economy
 is
 doing
 fantastic


and
 job
 growth
 is
 great
 then
 firing
 the


head
 of
 statistics
 and
 having
 everyone


distrust
 you
 know
 the
 subsequent
 numbers


because
 the
 subsequent
 head
 might
 be
 a


political
 appointee
 who's
 you
 know
 a


loyalist
 to
 Trump.
 It
 seems
 like
 you're


sort
 of
 shooting
 yourself
 in
 the
 foot.


The
 other
 huge
 contradiction


is
 that
 he
 says
 Powell
 is
 too
 late.


Right?
 This
 is
 the
 other
 huge


contradiction
 which
 is
 every
 day
 he


slams
 Powell.
 He's
 like,
 "Oh,
 you're
 too


late.
 You
 need
 to
 cut
 rates."


>> Well,
 if
 the
 job
 numbers
 were
 weak,
 then


I
 could
 understand
 this
 argument
 to
 some


extent.
 Oh,
 the
 job.
 But
 he's
 also


casting
 aspersions
 on
 the
 negative
 jobs


numbers.
 So,
 how
 is
 Powell
 too
 late?


There's
 I
 mean,
 this
 is
 it's
 an


irretrievable
 contradiction
 in
 the
 two


criticisms,
 both
 of
 the
 Fed
 and
 the
 BLS.


It's
 definitely
 a
 contradiction.
 I
 don't


think
 however
 that
 Trump
 necessarily


draws
 a
 direct
 connection
 between
 the


unemployment
 rate
 and
 uh
 interest
 rates


as
 well.
 You
 know,
 he
 seems
 to
 just
 like


low
 interest
 rates


>> and
 he
 seems
 to
 perceive
 that
 low


interest
 rates
 are
 basically
 a
 reward


for
 an
 improving
 economy.
 But
 yes,


>> but
 I
 mean
 lots
 of
 other
 contradictions.


You're
 absolutely
 right.
 So
 another
 one


is
 this
 idea
 that
 okay,
 a
 lot
 of the


weakness
 came
 through
 on
 the
 revision


side.
 the
 revisions
 are
 mostly
 coming


from
 small
 businesses
 who
 reply
 late.


And
 if
 you
 think
 about
 the
 Trump


administration,
 you
 know,
 they
 always


sort
 of
 portray
 themselves
 as
 a
 a
 good


business
 environment
 for
 smaller


businesses
 and
 it
 might
 be
 that
 that's


an
 area
 that's
 seeing
 some
 weakness.
 I


thought
 your
 question
 about
 sort
 of


internal
 morale
 and
 as
 Bill
 said,
 you


know,
 an
 agency
 staffed
 with
 patriots,
 I


mean,
 I
 just,
 you
 know,
 is
 BLS
 going
 to


be
 continue
 to
 be
 a
 destination
 for


people
 who
 are
 patriots,
 right?
 Or
 take


their
 jobs
 seriously
 in
 the
 future
 is
 a


really
 interesting
 question.
 Also,
 the


idea
 that
 like
 maybe
 we
 could
 like
 get


high
 data
 quality
 for
 like
 $20
 million,


given
 how
 much
 that's
 worth,
 it's
 just


like
 drives
 you
 crazy
 if
 that's
 really


all
 it
 took.
 But
 also
 I
 really
 like
 this


idea
 that
 it
 would
 have
 to
 always
 be


done
 in
 parallel
 with
 the
 current
 thing


such
 that
 the
 new
 data
 is
 sort
 of


provably
 backwards
 compatible
 with
 the


old
 data
 right
 so
 if
 you're
 going
 to


adopt
 a
 new
 methodology
 you
 need
 some


allocation
 to
 run
 two
 surveys
 at
 once


etc
 anyway
 even
 in
 a
 very
 short


conversation
 learned
 a
 lot
 from
 Bill


>> absolutely
 I
 do
 think
 it's
 worth


pointing
 out
 that
 there
 are
 other


statistical
 agencies
 in
 the
 world
 that


are
 experimenting
 with
 new
 technology


for
 data
 sources
 the
 UK's
 statistics


agency
 in
 particular
 they're
 going
 start


using,
 you
 know,
 price
 scanning
 data
 for


CPI.


>> Wait,
 have
 you
 heard
 about
 the
 whole


thing
 though
 with
 how
 they
 moved
 the
 O


andS
 to
 Wales
 and
 no
 one
 wanted
 to
 go


out
 there
 and
 have
 you
 heard
 about
 this?


>> I
 have
 Wales
 that
 distribute
 the
 the


large
 of
 the
 government
 across
 everyone


loves
 that
 idea.
 Let's
 not
 have
 it
 all


be
 concentrated
 in
 London.
 They're
 like,


"Okay,
 we're
 going
 to
 make
 everyone
 move


to
 Wales
 and
 now
 it's
 a
 lot
 harder
 for


the
 ONS
 to
 hire
 anyone."
 Anyway,
 it's


just
 a
 little
 interesting
 story
 out.


Maybe
 we'll
 cover
 it
 at
 some
 point.


>> Why
 people
 don't
 want
 to
 move
 to
 Wales.


>> No,
 I
 just
 think
 it's
 interesting,


right?
 Like
 there's
 I
 intuitively
 I
 love


this
 idea
 of
 like
 or
 why
 should
 all
 of


the
 government
 spending
 on
 public
 sector


stuff
 at
 the
 federal
 level
 be
 in
 the


richest
 city
 in
 the
 UK
 or
 why
 should
 it


all
 be
 in
 DC
 etc.
 And
 so
 this
 idea
 of


diff
 anyway
 it's
 a
 separate
 thing.
 It's


actually
 some
 interesting
 challenges


arise
 from
 it.


>> Okay.
 Shall
 we
 leave
 it
 there?


>> Yeah,
