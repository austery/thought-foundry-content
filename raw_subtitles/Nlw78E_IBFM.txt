From
 the
 New
 York
 Times,
 it's
 the


headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy
 Mumford.
 Today's


Tuesday,
 February
 3rd.
 Here's
 what
 we're


covering.


>> We
 have
 states
 that
 are
 so
 crooked
 and


they're
 counting
 votes.
 We
 have
 states


that
 I
 won
 that
 show
 I
 didn't
 win.
 Now


you're
 going
 to
 see


>> President
 Trump
 is
 stepping
 up
 his


rhetoric
 around
 American
 elections,


saying
 in
 an
 interview
 yesterday
 that


they
 should
 be
 overhauled
 and
 that
 the


Republican
 party
 should
 quote


nationalize
 voting.


>> The
 Republicans
 should
 say,
 "We
 want
 to


take
 over.
 We
 should
 take
 over
 the


voting
 the
 voting
 in
 at
 least


many
 15
 places."
 Trump's
 call
 for
 a


political
 party
 to
 seize
 control
 of


voting
 mechanisms
 is
 at
 odds
 with
 the


Constitution,
 which
 says
 that
 elections


are
 primarily
 run
 by
 the
 states.
 The


president
 has
 repeatedly
 said
 that


changes
 in
 the
 election
 system
 are


needed,
 pointing
 to
 debunked
 claims


about
 his
 defeat
 in
 2020.
 Citing
 those


claims,
 his
 administration
 has
 been


taking
 a
 number
 of
 steps
 to
 exert
 more


control
 over
 American
 elections.


He
 signed
 an
 executive
 order
 trying
 to,


among
 other
 things,
 demand
 proof
 of


citizenship
 before
 voting,
 an
 effort


that's
 largely
 been
 blocked
 by
 the


courts.
 And
 the
 Justice
 Department
 has


been
 demanding
 that
 numerous
 states
 turn


over
 their
 full
 voter
 roles
 containing


personal
 and
 private
 information.
 Just


last
 month,
 the
 attorney
 general
 sent
 a


letter
 to
 Minnesota
 specifically


demanding
 that
 data
 and
 calling
 it
 a


necessary
 step
 to
 quote,
 "Bring
 back
 law


and
 order."
 Election
 officials
 have


expressed
 concern
 that
 the
 data
 could
 be


misused
 or
 manipulated.


And
 lastly,
 the
 Times
 has
 learned
 that


in
 a
 remarkable
 moment,
 Trump
 talked


directly
 to
 the
 FBI
 agents
 who
 were
 sent


to
 search
 an
 election
 center
 in
 Georgia


last
 week.
 The
 agents
 seized
 truckloads


of
 ballots
 from
 2020
 from
 Fulton
 County,


which
 Biden
 won
 by
 a
 wide
 margin.
 A


former
 senior
 Justice
 Department


official
 who
 served
 in
 both
 Republican


and
 Democratic
 administrations
 said


Trump's
 interaction
 with
 the
 agents
 was


a
 major
 departure
 from
 past
 practice,


calling
 it
 quote
 extremely
 dangerous
 to


our
 democracy
 for
 the
 president
 to
 be


directly
 involved
 in
 how
 a
 criminal


investigation
 is
 carried
 out,
 especially


one
 that
 the
 president
 has
 a
 personal


stake
 in.
 In
 response
 to
 questions,
 a


White
 House
 spokesman
 said,
 "President


Trump
 pledged
 to
 secure
 America's


elections,
 and
 he
 has
 tasked
 the
 most


talented
 team
 of
 patriots
 to
 do
 just


that.


Now,
 two
 quick
 updates
 on
 the
 Trump


administration's
 immigration
 crackdown.


Today
 marks
 the
 fourth
 day
 and
 counting


of
 a
 partial
 government
 shutdown
 as


lawmakers
 on
 Capitol
 Hill
 clash
 over


funding
 for
 ICE
 and
 the
 Department
 of


Homeland
 Security.
 Last
 week,
 the
 Senate


passed
 a
 bipartisan
 bill
 that
 provided


only
 temporary
 funding
 for
 DHS
 in
 order


to
 allow
 for
 negotiations
 on
 guard
 rails


for
 federal
 agents,
 like
 ending


indiscriminate
 sweeps.
 But
 it's
 not


clear
 how
 quickly
 the
 House
 will
 move
 to


pass
 the
 bill
 since
 a
 number
 of


Republicans
 there
 are
 opposed
 to
 the


compromise.
 In
 the
 meantime,
 $800


billion
 in
 military
 spending
 is
 frozen,


as
 well
 as
 money
 for
 the
 departments
 of


labor,
 health
 and
 human
 services,
 and


transportation
 among
 other
 agencies.


and
 hundreds
 of
 thousands
 of
 immigrants


from
 Haiti
 have
 been
 given
 a
 temporary


reprieve
 after
 a
 federal
 judge
 hit
 pause


on
 the
 administration's
 effort
 to
 end


their
 legal
 protection.
 Many
 Haitians


have
 been
 allowed
 to
 live
 and
 work
 in


the
 US
 under
 what's
 known
 as
 TPS,


temporary
 protected
 status,
 due
 to
 a


humanitarian
 crisis
 and
 widespread


unrest
 in
 their
 country.
 The
 Trump


administration,
 however,
 had
 moved
 to


end
 those
 protections,
 arguing
 that


keeping
 Haitians
 in
 the
 US
 wasn't
 in
 the


national
 interest.
 But
 in
 a
 scathing


ruling,
 the
 judge
 said
 the


administration
 was
 motivated,
 at least


in
 part,
 by
 racial
 animists
 and
 that
 it


had
 ignored
 the
 billions
 of
 dollars
 that


Haitians
 contribute
 to
 the
 US
 economy.


Notably,
 Haitians
 play
 a
 crucial
 role
 in


America's
 health
 care
 system,
 working
 in


large
 numbers
 in
 hospitals,
 clinics,
 and


nursing
 homes.
 The
 head
 of
 one
 senior


care
 center
 in
 Boca
 Raton,
 Florida,
 for


example,
 said
 she
 would
 have
 to
 let
 go


of
 30
 Haitian
 employees
 if
 their
 status


changed.
 Haitians
 are
 not
 the
 only
 group


of
 TPS
 holders
 the
 administration
 has


targeted.
 In
 the
 past
 month
 or
 so,


federal
 judges
 have
 blocked
 the


government
 from
 ending
 TPS
 status
 for


people
 from
 Honduras,
 Nepal,
 Nicaragua,


and
 South
 Sudan.
 The
 administration
 has


signaled
 it
 will
 appeal
 all
 of
 those


rulings.


Last
 night,
 after
 a
 month's
 long
 battle,


Bill
 and
 Hillary
 Clinton
 agreed
 to


testify
 in
 the
 House
 Oversight


Committee's
 investigation
 into
 Jeffrey


Epstein.
 The
 Clintons
 had
 been
 facing


the
 threat
 of
 criminal
 contempt
 charges


if
 they
 refused,
 a
 push
 that
 had
 been


supported
 by
 Republicans
 and
 a
 handful


of
 Democrats.
 Getting
 the
 couple
 to


testify
 is
 a
 major
 victory
 for
 James


Comr,
 the
 Republican
 chair
 of
 the


oversight
 committee.
 He
 has
 tried
 to


shift
 the
 focus
 of
 his
 panel's
 Epstein


investigation
 away
 from
 President
 Trump


and
 his
 administration's
 handling
 of
 the


matter
 and
 toward
 prominent
 Democrats,


who
 also
 had
 ties
 to
 the
 convicted
 sex


offender.
 Bill
 Clinton
 took
 four
 trips


on
 Epstein's
 private
 jet
 in
 the
 early


2000s,
 though
 he
 says
 he
 never
 visited


Epstein's
 private
 island
 and
 cut
 off


contact
 with
 him
 two
 decades
 ago.


Hillary
 Clinton
 has
 said
 she
 never
 met


or
 spoke
 to
 Epstein.


The
 details
 of
 when
 and
 where
 the


Clintons
 will
 testify
 are
 still
 being


worked
 out,
 but
 it
 is
 nearly


unprecedented
 for
 a
 former
 president
 to


appear
 before
 Congress.


In
 Gaza
 yesterday,


the
 border
 crossing
 into
 Egypt
 reopened


after
 being
 largely
 closed
 since
 the


spring
 of
 2024.


The
 hope
 is
 that
 it
 can
 be
 a
 lifeline


for
 people
 who
 need
 to
 be
 evacuated
 for


medical
 care,
 but
 it
 had
 a
 faltering


start.
 Only
 a
 small
 number
 of


Palestinians
 appeared
 to
 get
 clearance


to
 leave
 yesterday.


The
 Times
 visited
 hospitals
 in
 Gaza
 and


talked
 with
 Palestinians
 who
 are


anxiously
 waiting
 to
 get
 approval
 to
 go.


>> One
 father
 said
 he
 was
 nervous
 that
 his


son,
 who
 has
 acute
 liver
 failure,


wouldn't
 get
 out
 in
 time.
 The
 reopening


is
 also
 letting
 a
 limited
 number
 of


Gazins
 who
 fled
 earlier
 in
 the
 war


return
 home
 for
 the
 first
 time.
 And


eventually,
 humanitarian
 groups
 hope
 the


crossing
 can
 be
 used
 to
 move
 truckloads


of
 aid
 into
 the
 territory.
 for
 now
 that


is
 not
 allowed.


And
 finally,


>> this
 is
 a
 major
 major
 announcement.
 This


is
 the
 first
 uh
 announcement
 about
 the


All-American
 halftime
 show.
 It's


happening
 right
 here.


>> The
 conservative
 group
 Turning
 Point
 USA


says
 it's
 going
 to
 put
 on
 its
 own


concert
 during
 the
 Super
 Bowl
 this


Sunday
 as
 an
 alternative
 to
 the
 official


halftime
 show.
 Bad
 Bunny,
 who
 has
 been
 a


very
 vocal
 critic
 of
 the
 Trump


administration,
 is
 the
 NFL's
 headliner.


But
 Turning
 Point
 has
 chosen
 Kid
 Rock.


>> What
 we're
 going
 to
 do
 is
 go
 out
 there


and
 just
 try
 to
 play
 some
 great
 music


for
 people
 who
 love
 this
 country.
 It's


that
 simple.


>> Kid
 Rock
 has
 played
 at
 political
 events


for
 President
 Trump
 in
 the
 past.
 He


joined
 in
 for
 the
 announcement
 during


which
 he
 accused
 the
 crowd
 at
 the


Grammys
 where
 Bad
 Bunny
 just
 won
 album


of
 the
 year
 of
 having
 a
 woke
 mind
 virus.


Turning
 Point
 USA
 plans
 to
 stream
 its


concert
 at
 the
 same
 time
 as
 the
 halftime


show
 which
 is
 generally
 the
 world's
 most


viewed
 concert
 every
 year.
 More
 than
 130


million
 people
 tuned
 in
 last
 year.


Those
 are
 the
 headlines.
 I'm
 Tracy


Mumford.
 We'll
 be
 back
 tomorrow.
