This
 is
 just
 going
 to
 be
 that
 next


evolution
 of
 there'll
 be
 a
 whole
 bunch


of
 things
 that
 a
 couple
 years
 ago
 we
 did


for
 our
 clients
 that
 our
 clients
 will
 do


for
 themselves.
 And
 the
 imperative
 will


then
 be
 to
 move
 to
 the
 even
 more


complicated
 questions.
 And
 to
 your


point,
 what
 are
 what
 are
 clients
 going


to
 pay
 us
 for?
 They're
 going
 to
 pay
 us


to
 find
 ways
 to
 double
 their
 market
 cap.


and
 and
 until
 we
 get
 to
 CEOs
 who
 say,
 "I


don't
 want
 to
 double
 my
 market
 cap,"
 I


think
 there'll
 always
 be
 a
 more


complicated
 set
 of
 questions
 and


opportunities
 out
 there.


So,
 I'm
 here
 with
 Bob
 Sternfelds,
 the


global
 managing
 director
 of
 McKenzie.


And
 Bob,
 thank
 you
 for
 being
 with
 us.


>> Oh,
 it's
 great
 to
 uh
 great
 to
 be
 here.


I'm
 excited
 to
 uh
 to
 have
 a
 chat
 with


you.
 So
 I
 want
 to
 start
 McKenzie
 uh
 is


turning
 maybe
 has
 turned
 100.
 HBR
 by
 the


way
 we're
 103.
 So
 welcome
 to
 the
 Century


Club.
 You
 know
 how
 would
 you
 summarize


the
 company's
 100year
 legacy?
 To
 what


extent
 has
 McKenzie
 created
 the
 ideas


that
 have
 shaped
 the
 business
 world
 or


to
 what
 extent
 is
 it
 about
 identifying


and
 suggesting
 best
 practices
 that
 come


from
 elsewhere?
 I
 guess
 I
 would
 start


with
 the
 nature
 of
 how
 we
 do
 our
 work.


And
 the
 idea
 is,
 look,
 we
 we
 co-create


with
 our
 clients
 and
 when
 we're
 at
 our


best,
 it's
 um
 it
 is
 it
 is
 figuring
 out


how
 do
 we
 help
 clients
 get
 to
 places


they
 can't
 get
 to
 themselves.
 And
 and


so,
 you
 know,
 the
 whole
 notion
 in
 some


ways
 of
 credit
 of
 did
 you
 create


something
 novel
 or
 did
 you,
 you
 know,


best
 practice
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 a
 maybe
 the


way
 we
 frame
 is
 we're
 co-creating
 with


clients
 to
 help
 them
 come
 up
 with
 things


that
 they
 may
 not
 have
 come
 up
 with


themselves
 or
 we
 might
 not
 have
 come
 up


with
 themselves.
 and
 and
 you
 know
 we
 we


clearly
 invest
 a
 boatload
 in
 proprietary


IP.
 We
 invest
 over
 a
 billion
 dollars
 a


year
 in
 innovation,
 new
 thought,
 new


ideas.
 McKenzie
 Global
 Institute
 for


example,
 which
 is
 a
 bit
 of
 our


independent
 research
 tank,
 but
 we've
 now


created
 Mackenzie
 Health
 Institute.
 I


think
 if
 you
 do
 look
 at
 their
 history,
 a


lot
 of
 that
 is
 novel
 thinking.
 you
 know,


the
 most
 recent
 looking
 at
 a
 a
 global


balance
 sheet
 and
 and
 kind
 of
 saying


how's
 the
 world
 when
 you
 look
 at
 assets


and
 liabilities.
 That's
 not
 a
 best


practice.
 That's
 a
 that's
 you
 know
 new


new
 thought.
 But
 equally
 part
 of
 the


reason
 we
 stay
 global
 as
 an
 operating


model
 is
 then
 at
 the
 more
 micro
 levels,


the
 clients
 that
 we
 serve
 don't
 want
 to


understand
 what
 the
 leading
 edge


innovation
 is
 in
 their
 particular


country.
 They
 want
 to
 understand


innovation
 around
 the
 world
 and
 perhaps


even
 cross
 sector


and
 that
 is
 part
 of
 our
 model.
 So
 I'd


probably
 say
 it's
 if
 I
 had
 to
 guess
 it's


probably
 half
 half
 on
 this
 around
 where


are
 there
 truly
 novel
 co-creation
 and


where
 is
 this
 idea
 of
 um
 of
 figuring
 out


how
 do
 you
 bring
 innovation
 around
 the


world
 to
 clients
 who
 may
 not
 have
 access


to
 that
 innovation
 based
 on
 their
 you


know
 the
 reality
 that
 they're
 in.
 So,


one
 area
 of
 innovation
 obviously
 is
 AI


and
 I'm
 sure
 you're
 advising
 companies


all
 the
 time
 on
 how
 to
 adapt
 to
 an


AIdriven
 world.
 I
 I
 want
 to
 talk
 about


that,
 but
 I
 I'm
 interested
 in
 the


internal
 discussions
 that
 are
 happening


at
 McKenzie
 about
 this.
 You
 know,
 to


what
 extent
 is
 AI
 shifting
 the
 economics


of
 your
 industry,
 headcount,
 pricing,


productivity,
 you
 know,
 are
 margins


improving?
 Are
 they
 under
 stress?
 I


mean,
 how
 what
 are
 the
 internal


conversations
 about
 AI
 for
 your


business?
 AI.
 We
 haven't
 talked
 about


that
 at
 all.
 No,


>> you
 should.
 It's
 really
 cool.


>> Can
 Can
 you
 educate
 me
 on
 it?
 No,
 I'm


just
 uh
 I'm
 just
 kidding.
 Um
 I
 mean,


it's
 hard
 to
 have
 a
 conversation
 in
 any


context
 right
 now
 um
 that
 doesn't
 link


back
 to
 to
 some
 form
 of
 AI.
 You
 know,
 I


think
 this
 question
 around
 AI
 and
 how


how
 it
 impacts
 McKenzie,


there's
 kind
 of
 two
 two
 sides
 of
 that


coin.
 there's
 a
 a
 client-f
 facing
 side


and
 then
 there's
 a
 what
 are
 the


implications
 on
 McKenzie
 and
 kind
 of
 the


way
 that
 I
 summarize
 it
 is
 there's
 a


unique
 moment
 to
 help
 all
 of
 our
 clients


reimagine
 themselves
 leveraging
 this


technology
 and
 to
 be
 able
 to
 do
 that
 we


have
 to
 rewire
 ourselves
 to
 be
 able
 to


deliver
 that
 and
 uh
 I
 may
 just
 start


with
 a
 bit
 of
 you
 know
 what
 what
 I'm


actually
 hearing
 from
 clients
 around
 the


world
 across
 all
 industries
 and
 across


across
 all
 geographies
 and
 you
 know
 I
 I


really
 hear
 in
 the
 truth
 room
 maybe
 two


things
 on
 the
 one
 hand
 an
 enormous


belief
 in
 the
 potential
 for
 this
 wave
 of


technological
 change
 and
 and
 that's


everything
 from
 enormous
 productivity


gains
 in
 areas
 like
 customer
 care
 or
 you


know
 back
 office
 processes
 but
 also
 to


growth
 things
 you
 know
 if
 you
 think


about
 radically
 shortening
 the
 time
 of


drug
 discovery
 and
 what
 that
 actually


means
 for
 longevity
 and
 and
 and
 life
 and


that's
 topline
 growth.
 So
 so
 folks
 are


excited
 and
 and
 they're
 they're


believers,


but
 at
 the
 same
 time
 from
 the
 the


conversations
 that
 I
 have
 with
 with


CEOs,


you
 know,
 they'll
 often
 say,
 "Hey
 Bob,


so
 do
 I
 listen
 to
 my
 CFO
 or
 my
 CIO
 right


now?"
 My
 CFO
 is
 in
 my
 ear
 that
 we're


spending
 a
 lot
 of
 money
 on
 technology,


but
 we're
 not
 yet
 seeing
 enterprise


level
 value
 from
 this.
 And
 so,
 do
 we


really
 need
 to
 be
 at
 the
 cutting
 edge
 or


why
 can't
 we
 be
 a
 fast
 follower?
 Let


other
 folks
 figure
 out
 where
 this
 is
 and


then
 we'll
 adopt
 quickly
 because
 it's
 a


lot
 more
 efficient
 to
 be
 a
 follower
 than


a
 than
 a
 leader.
 CIO
 is
 saying,
 "Are
 you


crazy?
 This
 is
 one
 of
 those
 moments
 and


if
 we're
 not
 in
 the
 lead,
 we're
 going
 to


get
 disrupted."
 You
 know,
 we
 spent
 a
 lot


of
 time
 looking
 at
 at
 least
 what
 we


think
 the
 answer
 is
 here.
 And
 and
 it's


interesting.
 I
 know
 we
 spent
 a
 lot
 of


time
 talking
 about
 technology,
 but
 what


we're
 finding
 is
 half,
 if
 not
 more
 of


the
 secret
 sauce
 is
 organizational


change
 as
 opposed
 to
 technology


implementation.
 This
 is
 for
 large
 large


enterprise.
 And
 you
 know,
 it's
 things


like,
 well,
 what
 does
 your
 look
 like


after
 you're
 implementing
 data?
 Could


you
 have,
 for
 example,
 a
 much
 flatter


organization
 that
 cuts
 out
 a
 lot
 of


middle
 layers
 and
 makes
 your


organization
 faster?
 When
 you
 think


about
 really
 complicated
 workflows,


think
 about
 a
 a
 mortgage
 process.
 You


got
 all
 these
 steps,
 you
 know,


origination,


credit
 scoring,
 collection,
 after


service,
 etc.
 Those
 are
 all
 departments


in
 a
 in
 a
 bank.
 Well,
 why
 do
 you
 have


four
 or
 five
 departments
 in
 a
 process
 if


you
 can
 really
 enable
 this
 through
 AI?


Can't
 you
 break
 those
 walls
 down?
 And
 so


we're
 spending
 a
 lot
 of
 time
 thinking


through
 not
 only
 what's
 the
 strategy
 and


how
 do
 you
 implement,
 but
 how
 do
 you


change
 the
 organization?
 How
 do
 you


rewire
 the
 organization
 to
 realize
 the


value
 and
 and
 if
 you
 can
 get
 that
 right,


all
 of a
 sudden
 the
 CFO
 and
 the
 CIO
 are


actually
 on
 the
 same
 page.
 But
 we're


finding
 that's
 harder
 and
 it's
 taking


longer
 than
 people
 thought.
 And
 so
 I
 do


think
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 in
 this
 period


where
 really
 enterprise
 fundamentally


changing
 themselves.
 Yes,
 enormous


potential.
 It's
 going
 to
 take
 a
 little


while
 to
 get
 there.
 So
 then
 you
 kind
 of


say,
 okay,
 what
 does
 that
 what
 does
 that


mean
 for
 McKenzie?
 Which
 is
 I
 think


where
 you
 you
 started
 the
 question,


Audi.
 And


it
 means
 a
 couple
 things
 for
 us.
 One,


um,
 you
 know,
 we
 we're
 applying
 this
 to


ourselves,
 and
 you
 know,
 I
 often
 get


asked,
 how
 big
 is
 Mackenzie?
 How
 many


how
 many
 people
 do
 you
 do
 you
 employ?


And
 um
 I
 I
 now
 update
 this
 almost
 every


month,
 but
 my
 latest
 answer
 to
 you
 would


be
 60,000,


but
 it's
 40,000
 humans
 and
 20,000


agents.
 And
 a
 little
 over
 a
 year
 and
 a


half
 ago,
 that
 was
 3,000
 agents.
 And
 and


I
 originally
 thought
 it
 was
 going
 to


take
 us
 to
 2030
 to
 get
 to
 one
 agent
 per


human.
 I
 think
 we're
 going
 to
 be
 there


in
 18
 months.
 and
 we'll
 have
 every


employee
 enabled
 by
 at
 least
 one
 or
 more


agents.
 And
 we're
 going
 to
 have
 a


workforce
 that
 is
 human
 and
 agentic.
 And


how
 do
 we
 how
 do
 we
 kind
 of
 navigate


that?
 That's
 kind
 of
 one
 piece
 of
 of


what
 are
 the
 assets
 and
 and
 technologies


that
 we're
 building
 in
 ourselves.
 The


other
 big
 piece
 is
 how
 does
 it
 change


our
 model?
 We're
 coming
 around
 to
 the


conviction
 that
 we're
 migrating
 pretty


quickly
 away
 from
 let's
 call
 it
 pure


advisory
 work
 which
 was
 a
 lot
 of
 the


origins
 of
 of
 our
 firm
 and
 kind
 of
 a
 fee


for
 service
 model
 etc.
 And
 what's
 it


moving
 to?
 It's
 moving
 to
 much
 more
 of


an
 outcomesbased
 model
 where
 we
 say
 look


let's
 identify
 a
 joint
 business
 case


together
 and
 we
 will
 underwrite
 the


outcomes
 of
 that
 of
 that
 business
 case


and
 and
 it
 aligns
 our
 interests
 with
 our


clients
 a
 lot
 more
 and
 I
 think
 will
 be


the
 way
 of
 the
 future.
 Now,
 I
 mean,
 AI


is
 is
 going
 to
 get
 better,
 right?
 We're


still
 in
 the
 early
 early
 phases
 of


generative
 AI.
 You
 know,
 if
 if


technology
 can
 continue
 to
 commoditize,


you
 know,
 even
 the
 kinds
 of
 analysis
 and


insight
 that,
 you
 know,
 a
 McKenzie
 has


long
 provided,
 you
 know,
 what
 what
 will


clients
 actually
 be
 pay
 be
 paying
 for


when
 they
 can
 probably
 do
 a
 lot
 of
 that


themselves?


>> The
 kind
 of
 problems
 that
 we
 have


tackled
 with
 our
 clients
 over
 a
 hundred


years
 has
 not
 been
 static.


it
 has
 changed
 radically
 and
 uh
 even
 you


know
 I'm
 now
 considered
 a
 dinosaur
 in


our
 firm
 because
 I'm
 a
 little
 over
 30


years
 with
 us
 but
 the
 stuff
 that
 I
 did


when
 I
 joined
 as
 an
 associate
 32
 years


ago


we
 wouldn't
 consider
 even
 doing
 right


now
 why
 because
 clients
 do
 that
 stuff


themselves
 and
 we
 are
 solving
 much
 more


complicated
 interconnected
 questions


with
 our
 clients
 And
 I
 think
 what
 this


is
 going
 to
 then
 mean
 is
 this
 is
 just


going
 to
 be
 that
 next
 evolution
 of


there'll
 be
 a
 whole
 bunch
 of
 things
 that


a
 couple
 years
 ago
 we
 did
 for
 our


clients
 that
 our
 clients
 will
 do
 for


themselves.
 And
 the
 imperative
 will
 then


be
 to
 move
 to
 the
 even
 more
 complicated


questions.
 And
 to
 your
 point,
 what
 are


what
 are
 clients
 going
 to
 pay
 us
 for?


They're
 going
 to
 pay
 us
 to
 find
 ways
 to


double
 their
 market
 cap.
 and
 and
 until


we
 get
 to
 CEOs
 who
 say,
 "I
 don't
 want
 to


double
 my
 market
 cap."
 I
 think
 there'll


always
 be
 a
 more
 complicated
 set
 of


questions
 and
 opportunities
 out
 there.


>> What
 is
 the
 evolving
 skills
 profile
 then


of
 a
 of
 a
 management
 consultant?
 You


know,
 what
 are
 you
 and
 do
 you
 even
 know


yet?
 I
 mean,
 what
 what
 are
 you
 looking


for
 in
 new
 hires?
 And
 that
 must
 be


evolving
 pretty
 quickly.


>> I
 might
 frame
 it
 in
 what
 are
 some
 things


we're
 confident
 about
 now
 and
 then
 what


are
 some
 things
 we're
 exploring.
 When
 I


came
 into
 this
 role
 and
 it
 was
 a
 little


over
 four
 years
 ago,
 I
 asked
 our
 talent


attraction
 team,
 "How
 we
 doing
 on


attracting
 talent?"
 And
 and
 I
 got
 a


we're
 doing
 great,
 Bob.
 We're
 doing


great.
 I
 said,
 "Why?"
 And
 said,
 "Well,


you
 know,
 we
 we
 get
 over
 a
 million


applications
 a
 year
 and
 we
 we
 hire


anywhere
 between
 8
 and
 10,000
 people
 and


and
 even
 the
 million
 aren't
 a
 normal


distribution,
 right?
 It's
 there's
 some


of
 the
 brightest
 minds
 in
 the
 world
 that


are
 applying.
 So
 effectively,
 what's
 the


problem?
 Why
 are
 you
 asking
 me?
 You


know,
 let
 me
 let
 me
 go
 back
 and
 do
 my


job."
 And
 and
 I
 kind
 of
 kept
 asking
 the


question,
 but
 well,
 how
 many
 profiles


are
 we
 are
 we
 really
 looking
 for?
 What


what
 are
 we
 systematically
 screening


out?
 And
 and
 it
 turned
 out
 that
 really


when
 you
 bo
 it
 down
 worldwide,


there's
 really
 only
 500
 pathways
 that


would
 lead
 you
 to
 McKenzie.


And
 that
 wasn't
 tying
 with
 what
 our
 own


organizational
 research
 was
 saying
 that


the
 half-life
 on
 skills
 was
 getting


shorter,
 that
 people
 were
 too
 focused
 on


paper
 ceiling,
 did
 you
 have
 the
 right


credentials?
 And
 so
 we
 we
 actually


applied
 analytics
 on
 ourselves
 and
 took


the
 last
 20
 years
 of
 data
 and
 said
 what


are
 the
 skills
 and
 characteristics
 that


are
 most
 likely
 to
 make
 partner
 in


McKenzie
 because
 that's
 it's
 not
 perfect


but
 it's
 kind
 of
 a
 marker
 of
 of
 success.


You
 know
 only
 one
 in
 six
 hires
 make
 uh


make
 partner.
 And
 it
 turned
 out
 we
 had


some
 bias
 in
 our
 system.
 I'll
 just
 give


you
 I
 mean
 it
 was
 McKenzie
 so
 we
 had


like
 50
 different
 implications
 but
 I'll


give
 you
 the
 biggest
 three.


One
 was
 that


we
 were
 too
 focused
 on
 did
 you
 have


perfect
 marks
 versus
 did
 you
 have
 a


setback
 and
 recover
 and
 the
 applicant


who
 had
 a
 setback
 and
 recovered
 was
 more


resilient
 and
 more
 likely
 to
 be
 a
 higher


probability
 of
 making
 partner
 in


McKenzie
 and
 we
 weren't
 screening
 for


that.
 So
 we've
 changed
 the
 process
 to


look
 for
 resilience
 in
 the
 in
 the


application
 process.
 It
 may
 sound


shocking,
 but
 we
 weren't
 indexing
 enough


on


had
 you
 had
 real
 experience


in
 a
 significant
 way
 working
 with


others.
 Fundamentally,
 we're
 about


helping
 our
 clients
 change.
 And
 you


know,
 if
 you've
 worked
 if
 you've
 done
 a


team
 sport
 or
 if
 you've
 worked
 in


retail,
 you
 know,
 working
 your
 way


through
 college,
 you've
 had
 to
 engage


with
 others.
 and
 it's
 built
 a
 skill,
 a


human-touman
 skill
 that
 um
 we're
 now


indexing
 a
 lot
 more
 on.
 And
 and
 then
 the


last
 one
 was
 um
 was
 interesting.


Did
 you
 have
 the
 aptitude
 to
 learn
 new


stuff
 versus
 had
 you
 mastered
 the


subject
 that
 you
 chose
 to
 study?
 And
 uh


my
 my
 youngest
 guy
 used
 this
 one
 against


me
 actually
 when
 he
 was
 um
 he
 was
 ch


middle
 guy
 was
 changing
 his
 major
 for


the
 third
 time
 and
 I
 was
 a
 little


frustrated
 with
 him
 and
 he's
 like
 but


dad
 you
 published
 a
 paper
 that
 said
 you


know
 if
 you
 have
 the
 aptitude
 to
 learn


new
 stuff
 and
 I'm
 like
 yeah
 but
 you
 have


to
 do
 well
 in
 the
 subject
 that
 you
 go
 to


send
 send
 his
 resume
 to
 me.


>> It's
 the
 only
 time


>> it's
 the
 only
 time
 he
 quoted
 me.
 I
 was


like
 really?
 But
 um
 but
 it
 did
 get
 us
 to


then
 change
 our
 assessment
 techniques


where
 we
 purposely
 create
 an
 environment


where
 you
 will
 no
 human
 in
 the
 world


will
 have
 any
 pattern
 recognition
 in


this
 environment
 and
 we
 figure
 out
 how


well
 do
 you
 do
 in
 an
 environment
 where


you
 have
 no
 pattern
 recognition.
 You


just
 have
 to
 go
 figure
 things
 out.
 So


those
 are
 some
 of
 the
 skills
 now
 we
 know


we're
 moving
 to.


We've
 launched
 more
 of
 an
 exploratory


look
 now
 going
 forward
 where
 you
 say,


"Okay,
 but
 if
 everyone
 gets
 super
 human


with
 these
 AI
 tools,
 what
 do
 you
 want
 to


add
 on
 top
 of
 this
 resilience,
 teamwork,


ability
 to
 learn
 new
 stuff?"
 That
 part
 I


just
 told
 you
 I
 feel
 pretty
 solid
 about.


This
 part
 I'm
 going
 to
 tell
 you
 is
 is


places
 we're
 more
 in
 exploration
 mode


and
 just
 be
 be
 honest
 with
 you.
 Uh
 and


one
 of
 them
 is
 um
 well,
 what
 do
 the


models
 not
 do
 well?
 Right?
 What
 do
 the


models
 not
 do
 well?
 one,
 they
 don't


aspire.
 They're
 not
 good
 at
 setting
 the


right
 aspiration
 level.
 And
 so
 when
 you


think
 about
 what
 great
 leaders
 do
 is


they
 help
 an
 organization
 set
 the
 right


as
 what
 should
 we
 aspire
 to?
 And
 so
 how


do
 we
 start
 to
 look
 for
 and
 develop
 the


skills
 of
 leadership?
 Leadership
 is


going
 to
 be
 durable
 in
 a
 postAI
 world


because
 one
 of
 the
 great
 things
 leaders


do
 is
 they
 help
 set
 an
 aspiration
 and


get
 people
 to
 stretch.
 So
 we're
 we're


kind
 of
 focusing
 on
 that.
 The
 second
 is


judgment.
 And
 you've
 seen
 time
 and
 time


again
 the
 these
 models
 don't
 there's


there's
 not
 truth
 in
 the
 model.
 There's


not
 judgment
 in
 the
 model.
 Humans
 need


to
 impose
 those
 parameters.
 So
 how
 do


you
 build
 judgment
 and
 how
 do
 you
 build


that
 capability?
 And
 then
 maybe
 the
 the


last
 one
 we're
 we're
 we're
 spending
 a


lot
 of
 time
 on
 is
 um
 the
 models
 are


inference
 models.
 They're
 great
 at
 a


linear
 approach
 to
 problem
 solving,


which
 is
 kind
 of
 what
 we've
 been


teaching
 for
 the
 last
 hundred
 years.


What
 they're
 not
 great
 is
 discontinuous


leaps,
 truly
 novel
 thinking.
 And
 so


we're
 starting
 to
 figure
 out
 where
 are


backgrounds
 that
 are
 going
 to
 be
 more


creative
 to
 come
 up
 with
 things
 that


aren't
 about
 the
 next
 logical
 step,
 but


are
 about
 a
 discontinuity.
 And
 so
 we're


going
 back
 to
 liberal
 arts
 degrees
 and


kind
 of
 saying,
 hey,
 you
 know,
 let's


come
 back
 to
 some
 of
 the
 things
 that


might
 have
 been
 dep
 prioritized
 in
 the


past
 to
 see
 if
 we
 can
 get
 a
 little
 bit


more
 creativity.
 We've
 sort
 of
 looked


looked
 back,
 we've
 looked
 forward,


you've
 talked
 about
 the
 some
 of
 the


celebratory
 stuff
 that's
 going
 on.
 I


need
 to
 ask
 though,
 you
 you've
 also
 had,


you
 know,
 your
 share
 of
 un
 unwelcome


publicity
 in
 recent
 years.
 And
 I'm


talking
 about
 Oxycontton,
 bribery,


bribery
 charges
 in
 South
 Africa,


conflict
 of
 interest
 accusations
 uh
 in


the
 US
 and
 elsewhere.
 How
 do
 you
 account


for
 all
 of
 that?
 How
 do
 you
 look
 at
 what


happened
 and
 and
 why?
 Well,
 I'm
 glad
 you


asked
 and
 you
 know
 this
 has
 been


I
 think
 it's
 been
 a
 real
 soularching
 for


us
 starting
 about
 four
 or
 five
 years
 ago


of
 um
 really
 two
 questions.


On
 the
 one
 hand,


where
 should
 we
 be
 more
 humble
 and
 and


learn
 from
 our
 mistakes


and
 at
 the
 same
 time
 where
 should
 we
 be


c
 more
 courageous
 and
 just
 say
 look


we
 disagree
 with
 you
 and
 we're
 even


though
 we'll
 face
 criticism
 we're
 going


to
 push
 back
 because
 that's
 what
 we


believe
 in.
 And
 and
 let
 me
 kind
 of
 parse


each
 of
 those.
 you
 know,


look
 that
 some
 of
 the
 ones
 that
 you


mentioned
 fall
 clearly
 in
 the
 in
 the


humble
 camp.
 And
 I
 think
 some
 of
 the


great
 learnings
 that
 we
 had
 if
 I
 just


take
 take
 two
 in
 particular
 the
 work


with
 opioids
 and
 our
 partnerships
 in


South
 Africa
 you
 know
 what
 we
 learned
 is


that
 we
 have
 to
 have
 a
 higher
 diligence


around
 client
 selection
 and
 we
 put
 in


place
 a
 framework
 that


is
 a
 really
 robust
 assessment
 now
 that


looks
 across
 every
 aspect
 from
 the


country,
 the
 topic,
 the
 institution,
 the


individuals,
 and
 the
 operating


environment
 to
 say,
 is
 this
 a
 client


that
 we
 actually
 want
 to
 bring
 in
 to
 the


firm?
 And
 and
 so
 one
 of
 the
 languages


that
 I've
 used
 with
 our
 partners,
 and


you
 know,
 it's
 hard
 to
 drive
 change
 in
 a


partnership
 is
 um
 you
 all
 grew
 up
 with


the
 idea
 that
 one
 of
 the
 privileges
 of
 a


partner
 is
 to
 commit
 the
 firm.
 And
 I'm


not
 saying
 that's
 not
 the
 case
 anymore,


but
 you
 don't
 do
 it
 alone.
 You
 do
 it


with
 risk
 professionals.
 and
 and
 we


invested
 about
 a
 billion
 dollars.
 I


brought
 in
 the
 head
 of
 um
 internal
 audit


from
 Apple,
 the
 head
 of
 compliance
 from


Walmart
 to
 basically
 kind
 of
 modernize


us
 around
 these
 processes.
 And
 it's
 why


I
 also
 said,
 look,
 we
 apologize.
 We
 got


those
 wrong.
 And
 but
 we
 don't
 want
 to


set
 out
 just
 to
 remediate
 the
 problem.


We
 want
 to
 set
 out
 to
 try
 and
 set
 the


standard
 for
 professionalism
 for
 our


industry.
 And
 so
 I
 think
 that
 is
 an


important
 lesson
 of


How
 do
 you
 learn
 from
 your
 mistakes?


Stay
 humble,
 but
 not
 seek
 to
 just
 repair


them,
 but
 seek
 to
 actually
 make
 make


yourself
 better.
 And
 we've
 had
 a
 lot
 of


learnings
 around
 that.
 Mackenzie
 has


learned
 a
 ton
 from
 this,
 and
 we're


setting
 out
 to
 make
 ourselves
 better.


And
 and
 one
 of the
 things
 that
 I've


tried
 to
 open
 myself
 up
 to
 both
 to


regulators
 and
 to
 clients
 is
 look,
 these


are
 the
 new
 protocols
 we
 put
 in
 place.


Do
 you
 have
 any
 ideas
 on
 how
 we
 can
 make


them
 better?
 Because
 even
 what
 we've
 put


in
 place,
 I'm
 not
 sure
 we're
 ever
 going


to
 be
 done
 on
 this
 front.
 So,
 I
 just


wanted
 to
 close
 the
 loop
 on
 that.
 Like,


I'm
 obsessed
 with
 we
 got
 to
 be
 a
 journey


to
 try
 and
 aspire
 to
 set
 the
 standard


for
 professionalism
 for
 our
 our
 our


profession.


But
 then,
 as
 you
 say,
 look,
 the


lifeblood
 of
 what
 we
 do
 and
 it's
 why


so
 many
 great
 talent
 from
 around
 the


world
 come
 is
 the
 kind
 of
 impact
 that


they
 can
 have
 with
 clients.
 I
 mean,
 from


the
 outside,
 you
 know,
 it
 looked
 like


McKenzie
 was
 committed
 to
 growing
 as


quickly
 as
 possible
 in
 markets
 all
 over


the
 world,
 you
 know,
 with
 with
 by
 design


relatively
 little
 centralized
 oversight.


And
 again,
 from
 the
 outside,
 that
 sounds


like
 a
 a
 recipe
 for
 trouble.
 Is
 that
 is


that
 a
 fair
 analysis?


>> Uh,
 no,
 not
 really.
 It's
 easy
 to
 kind
 of


say
 that
 are
 you
 from
 the
 outside,
 but


the
 truth
 of
 the
 matter
 is
 you
 have


three
 or
 four
 forces
 that
 are
 going
 on


here.


you
 know,
 on
 the
 one
 hand,
 there's
 a
 an


increasing


scrutiny


on
 the
 side
 of
 um
 of
 media,
 governments


for
 for
 all
 institutions.
 And
 um
 and
 so


one
 of
 the
 things
 that,
 you
 know,
 that


we
 learned
 through
 this
 process
 is
 there


are
 some
 things
 that
 we're
 going
 to
 be


criticized
 for
 that
 that
 we're
 just


going
 to
 push
 back
 on.
 We
 got
 heavily


criticized
 for
 our
 work
 in
 hard
 to
 abate


sectors
 on
 their
 transition
 issues
 and


it
 was
 you
 know
 Mackenzie's
 accelerating


climate
 degradation
 etc.
 And
 we
 pushed


back
 and
 said
 no
 look
 if
 you're
 going
 to


be
 committed
 to
 climate
 transition
 you


have
 to
 work
 with
 the
 hardest
 to
 abate


sectors.
 It's
 just
 naive
 to
 say
 that


you're
 going
 to
 solve
 this
 problem


without
 that.
 And
 so
 there's
 a
 portion


of
 this
 that
 was
 rooted
 in
 just
 more


transparency,
 more
 criticism.
 and
 I'm


trying
 to
 build
 a
 bit
 of
 thicker
 skin.


There's
 a
 portion
 which
 was
 an
 evolution


in
 our
 organization
 model
 that
 said
 look


as
 as
 we
 do
 get
 bigger


and
 as
 the
 world
 gets
 more
 complicated


and
 more
 requirements
 are
 thrown
 in,


we
 do
 need


tighter
 compliance
 standards.
 And
 um


this
 is
 where


the
 idea
 that
 we
 should
 have
 the
 same


compliance
 and
 accountability
 standards


as
 a
 publicly
 traded
 company
 even
 though


we're
 not
 publicly
 traded
 was
 I
 think


one
 of
 the
 greatest


changes
 that
 we've
 been
 through
 in
 the


last
 six
 years.
 And
 growth
 has
 never


been
 our
 objective
 function.
 Um
 we're


privately
 traded.
 We
 don't
 have


quarterly
 earnings.
 You
 don't
 see


McKenzie
 talking
 about
 oh
 we
 had
 revenue


growth
 of
 this
 or
 that
 because
 the
 ethos


internally
 is
 that
 we're
 a
 profession


not
 a
 business
 meaning
 that
 we
 want
 to


put
 our
 clients
 interests
 ahead
 of


ourselves
 and
 the
 objective
 should
 be


are
 we
 doing
 distinctive
 work
 versus
 you


know
 any
 kind
 of
 work
 but
 without
 the


right
 controls
 you
 can't
 guarantee
 that


and
 so
 one
 of
 the
 things
 I
 think
 we


learned
 is
 even
 though
 we
 had
 that
 as


our
 ethos
 and
 the
 objective
 function
 was


never
 grow
 at
 all
 cost.
 If
 you
 don't
 put


in
 place
 compliance,
 you're
 not
 going
 to


actually
 be
 able
 to
 enforce
 those


standards.
 And
 and
 it's
 painful
 for
 a


partnership
 to
 give
 up
 some
 of
 that


autonomy.


But
 I
 think
 it's
 one
 that
 we
 now
 have


pretty
 immediate.
 You
 you
 never
 get
 100%


uniformity
 in
 a
 in
 a
 partnership.
 But
 I


think
 there's
 pretty
 good
 agreement
 that


um
 these
 things
 have
 made
 us
 better
 and


it's
 worth
 giving
 up
 that
 autonomy
 to


actually
 preserve
 the
 integrity
 of
 the


enterprise.


>> I'll
 throw
 one
 more,
 you
 know,
 sort
 of


critical
 trope
 your
 way,
 which
 is,
 you


know,
 that
 people
 would
 say
 consultants


prescribe
 frameworks
 but
 don't
 have
 to


live
 with
 the
 consequences.
 How
 do
 you


ensure
 that
 McKenzie's
 advice
 is
 more


than
 a
 PowerPoint
 strategy?
 You
 know,


that
 it
 creates
 real
 lasting
 long-term


impact.


>> I
 hope
 we
 get
 out
 of
 PowerPoint
 entirely


at
 someday,
 and
 I
 say
 that
 with
 love
 to


Microsoft,
 but
 um
 but
 it's
 it
 isn't


about


providing
 a
 unique
 insight.


It
 goes
 back
 to
 this
 notion
 of
 what
 we


really
 aspire
 to
 be
 is
 to
 be
 impact


partners
 with
 our
 clients
 and
 um
 we're


on
 a
 change
 journey
 of
 moving
 quite


frankly
 from
 a
 model
 that
 was
 advisory


to
 one
 that
 um
 underwrites
 outcomes
 and


and
 today
 Audi
 about
 a
 third
 of
 our


revenues
 total
 are
 underwriting


outcomes.
 So,
 it's
 not,
 hey,
 you
 handed


me
 a
 PowerPoint,
 great.
 It's
 we


collectively
 signed
 up
 for
 this
 outcome


together,
 and
 we're
 tied
 on
 this
 journey


all
 the
 way
 through
 until
 that
 impact
 is


delivered.
 My
 hope
 is
 that
 that
 crosses


a
 majority
 of
 the
 revenues
 by
 the
 time


I'm
 done
 being
 the
 global
 manager


partner.


>> We've
 been
 around
 100
 years,
 you've
 been


around
 100
 years,
 we're
 all
 presenting


important
 ideas.
 Uh,
 there
 are
 others
 as


well.
 And
 yet,
 this
 is
 hard,
 right?


Running
 a
 business
 is
 hard.
 Nobody


really
 has
 has
 cracked
 the
 code
 forever.


Where
 do
 you
 think
 leaders
 most


consistently,
 you
 know,
 get
 things


wrong?


>> I
 think
 there
 is
 some
 mix
 of
 a
 couple


things
 that


are,
 at least
 in
 my
 mind,
 increasingly


important.
 You
 know,
 one
 is
 this
 um


this
 hunger
 and
 thirst


to
 acquire
 new
 information.
 And
 whenever


you
 get
 too
 confident,
 too


overconfident,


I
 think
 change
 for
 the
 negative
 is
 going


to
 come.
 And
 and
 so
 how
 do
 you
 have
 this


almost
 ruthless
 quest
 for
 let
 me


continue
 to
 question
 new
 things
 and
 and


maybe
 also
 from
 all
 levels
 in
 the


organization.
 Often
 the
 best
 ideas
 are


embedded
 somewhere
 lowered
 out.
 The


second
 and
 Audi
 you
 kind
 of
 linked
 it


when
 you
 talked
 about
 both
 of
 our


organizations
 is
 how
 much
 do
 you
 do
 this


yourself
 versus
 do
 you
 think
 about


partnerships


and
 I
 think
 increasingly
 we're
 seeing


when
 people
 collaborate
 across
 the
 value


chain
 etc
 you
 you
 find
 disproportionate


gain
 and
 yet
 our
 organizations
 aren't


geared
 to
 collaborate
 well
 right
 we're


just
 not
 and
 so
 thirst
 for
 new
 a
 focus


on
 on
 collaboration


And
 then
 finally,
 I
 would
 say,
 and
 maybe


this
 is
 kind
 of
 a
 sign
 of
 the
 times,


maybe
 not,
 but
 um
 speed
 matters.


You
 know,
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that
 we've


we've
 studied
 to
 death
 is
 um
 faster


organizations
 outperform
 slower


organizations
 even
 if
 they
 make
 more


mistakes.
 And
 yet,
 we're
 not
 wired
 to
 do


that.
 There's
 such
 risk
 aversion
 in


large
 enterprise.


If
 we
 could
 lean
 in
 a
 bit
 more
 to
 that,


I
 think
 great
 things
 happen.
 So
 on
 the


issue
 of
 management,
 what
 what
 seems
 to


be
 fundamentally
 different
 today,
 you


know,
 versus
 how
 companies
 have
 to
 adapt


to,
 you
 know,
 jolts
 in
 geopolitics
 or
 or


with
 technology,
 you
 know,
 what
 are
 you


seeing
 in
 terms
 of
 kind
 of
 new


management
 paradigms
 that
 are
 taking


shape
 today?


>> I
 kind
 of
 look
 at
 it
 from
 the
 lens
 of


the
 discussions
 that
 I
 have,
 which
 is


what
 are
 CEOs
 focused
 on,
 right?
 What


are
 what
 are
 some
 big
 topics
 right
 now


that
 that
 are
 occupying
 the
 minds
 of


senior
 management
 teams
 and
 their


discussions
 both
 amongst
 themselves
 and


and
 and
 with
 boards
 and
 and
 as
 you
 can


imagine
 that
 that
 varies
 based
 on
 where


you
 sit
 in
 the
 world.
 But
 there
 are
 some


themes
 to
 your
 question
 Audi
 that
 seem


to
 be
 transversal.
 I'd
 be
 lying
 if
 one


of
 the
 themes
 wasn't
 one
 of
 the
 ones


that
 we
 talked
 about,
 which
 is
 how
 do
 I


get
 value
 from
 this
 technology,
 you


know,
 and
 and
 what
 is
 everyone
 else


doing
 because
 this
 is
 hard.
 And
 so
 I


would
 put
 that
 as
 one
 of
 the
 the
 themes


of
 how
 do
 I
 transform
 my
 enterprise


through
 this
 this
 revolution
 in


technology
 that
 we're
 seeing
 right


before
 our
 eyes.
 The
 second
 big
 theme
 is


um
 how
 do
 I
 build
 more
 institutional


resilience?


because
 I'm
 increasingly
 I'm
 talking
 now


in
 the
 in
 the
 guise
 of
 a
 CEO
 of
 the
 mind


that
 unfortunately
 things
 will
 never
 go


back
 to
 how
 they
 were
 there's
 going
 to


be
 a
 world
 of
 continuous
 shocks
 and
 so


in
 a
 world
 of
 continuous
 shocks
 do
 I


have
 enough
 institutional
 resilience
 in


my
 organization


and
 when
 you
 burrow
 under
 that
 you
 know


what
 what
 folks
 often
 say
 is


I
 need
 I
 like
 sports
 I'll
 give
 you
 a


sports
 analogy
 I
 I
 need
 to
 play
 offense


and
 defense
 at
 the
 same
 time.
 So,
 I
 need


defense
 that
 I
 need
 enough
 buffer,


enough


cushion
 to
 be
 able
 to
 withstand


something
 that
 I
 don't
 see
 coming.
 But
 I


also
 can't
 just
 play
 defense.
 I
 need


some
 capacity
 to
 take
 some
 bold
 bets


even
 when
 I
 may
 be
 getting
 hit
 with


exogenous
 shocks.
 Can
 I
 play
 offense
 and


defense
 at
 the
 same
 time?
 is
 my
 simple


version
 of
 how
 do
 you
 build
 um


institutional
 resilience?


And
 then
 maybe
 the
 last
 one,
 if
 I
 were


to
 just
 give
 you
 three,
 is
 um


I
 haven't
 met
 a
 CEO
 yet


that
 thinks
 that
 their
 organization


model
 is
 perfect.


Haven't
 met
 one.
 And
 you
 know,
 a
 lot
 of


the
 the
 seinal
 thinking
 actually
 comes


from
 some
 stuff.
 I'm
 going
 to
 date


myself
 here,
 but
 I
 told
 you
 I
 was
 doing


history.
 A
 1959
 paper
 in
 HBR
 by
 Gil
 Cle


was
 a
 this
 was
 before
 he
 became
 a
 GMP.


He
 was
 one
 of
 my
 predecessors,
 but
 it


was
 about
 creating
 a
 global
 organization


and
 it
 was
 the
 precursor
 thinking
 to
 the


matrixed
 organization.


And
 if
 you
 kind
 of
 look
 at
 almost
 every


large
 enterprise
 today,
 there
 is
 some


version
 of
 a
 matrixed
 organization.


And
 I
 hear
 different
 tension
 points
 from


CEOs
 about
 why
 their
 org
 is
 one
 of
 the


bottlenecks
 in
 getting
 done
 what
 they


need
 to
 get
 done.
 It's
 too
 slow.
 It's


too
 cumbersome.
 I
 can't
 resource


reallocate.
 It
 doesn't
 help
 me
 with


complicated
 geography
 decisions.


Whatever
 it
 may
 be,
 Audi,
 I
 hear
 a
 lot


of
 questions
 about
 what
 should
 my
 future


organization
 model
 be?


>> So,
 in
 10
 years
 time,
 what
 would
 you


like
 McKenzie
 to
 be
 known
 for
 that
 it
 is


not
 known
 for
 today?
 I
 think
 it's
 got
 to


be
 a
 mix
 of
 what
 do
 I
 hope
 we're
 still


known
 for
 and
 then
 what
 might
 be
 some


new
 things,
 right?
 I
 because
 it's
 not


going
 to
 be
 just
 stuff
 that
 McKenzie


isn't
 known
 for
 today.
 I
 I
 hope
 the
 part


that
 it's
 continued
 to
 be
 known
 for
 is


um
 leadership
 factory
 of
 the
 world,


right?
 And
 and
 one
 of
 the
 things
 that's


been
 very
 exciting
 is
 no
 matter
 how
 long


folks
 stay
 with
 us,
 they
 tend
 to
 do


pretty
 well
 wherever
 they
 go.
 and
 and


you
 know
 we
 produce
 more
 CEOs
 than
 any


other
 institution
 in
 the
 world
 and
 I


hope
 that's
 still
 the
 case
 in
 10
 years


our
 are
 folks
 coming
 to
 us
 and
 you
 know


sorry
 this
 is
 just
 my
 direct
 language


you
 know
 maybe
 the
 experience
 isn't
 easy


and
 and
 maybe
 it's
 pretty
 hard
 and
 they


got
 a
 lot
 of
 tough
 feedback
 but
 do
 we


make
 you
 a
 better
 leader
 no
 matter
 how


long
 you're
 in
 Mckenzie
 2
 years
 30
 years


but
 do
 you
 leave
 Mackenzie
 a
 better
 I


hope
 that
 remains
 I
 hope
 the
 part
 that


is
 new
 to
 your
 point
 is
 something
 that's


inflight
 today
 but
 I
 think
 not
 really


well
 known
 which
 is
 we
 complete
 this


journey
 from
 being
 an
 adviser
 to
 an


impact
 partner
 and
 that
 McKenzie
 is
 not


known
 for
 hey
 they
 gave
 me
 great
 advice


but
 you
 know
 if
 it
 worked
 that
 was


because
 they
 were
 smart
 and
 if
 it
 didn't


work
 it's
 because
 I
 didn't
 implement
 uh


which
 is
 the
 you
 know
 the
 joke
 right
 but


as
 it
 moved
 to
 you
 know
 what
 we
 designed


a
 business
 case
 together
 and
 these
 guys


underwrote
 the
 same
 outcomes
 that
 I
 took


to
 the
 board
 and
 we
 went
 on
 this
 journey


and
 um
 we
 kept
 at
 it
 until
 we
 got
 to


someplace
 I
 didn't
 think
 I
 could
 get
 to.


I
 think
 that's
 the
 the
 part
 that
 I'd


love
 to
 land
 fully
 in
 this
 next
 decade.


>> Bob,
 thank
 you
 very
 much
 for
 for
 being


here.
 That
 was
 a
 great
 discussion
 and


congratulations
 on
 turning
 100.


>> Thank
 you.
 I
 enjoyed
 it.
