So most of the time when we think
about climate change,
we conjure these images of wildfires
and storms and floods.
But the reality is
that temperature alone kills.
And in particular, right here in Africa.
We don't see it in the capital
of France or the US,
because it's mostly happening
in poor countries,
which are already hot,
and where citizens
don't have the protection
of air conditioning or office jobs.
By the best estimates,
by the end of this century, in 2100,
an extra six million people will die
just because of increased temperature.
And all of these deaths will take place
in low- or middle-income countries.
Every ton of carbon that we emit
from the US, from India, from China,
stays in the atmosphere
for a very, very, very long time,
contributes to the warming
of the Earth and therefore,
kills people.
Now let's try, for the sake
of concreteness,
to put a dollar value
on these lives cut short.
Now I can see what you're thinking,
the economist comes,
you know, we cannot really price a life.
The reality is, we are doing
it all the time.
As individuals, we are thinking
about, you know,
the probability of dying
in a bicycle accident
and the cost of a helmet
and we kind of weigh
one against the other.
And our governments also do it.
For example, when thinking
about the cost of investment
that can protect the lives
of people on a highway, for example.
Mexico, which has
about the world's average income,
uses a value of a statistical life
of about two million dollars.
So using this number
of two million dollars
for a value of a statistical
life, as a benchmark,
we calculated the dollar value
of the life lost
because of emissions.
And the costs are staggering.
Every year,
the greenhouse gas emissions of the OECD
inflict a cost 
of 1.7 trillion dollars --
with a T --
on low- and middle-income countries.
And the costs are the largest
in the countries that are the poorest.
Take Niger,
a country where the GDP
is just shy of 650 dollars a year.
The yearly damages from the OECD
emissions in Niger are 9,000 dollars.
Meanwhile, from COP to COP,
rich countries are nickel and diming
the poor countries for the climate money,
for mitigation, for adaptation.
We are supposed to be
on the road map from Baku to Belem
from 300 billion to 1.3 trillion,
but it is likely to be a road to nowhere
if we continue with buzzwords
and with hairy schemes.
The money is difficult to raise.
It's even harder to spend.
Climate negotiators
from India, from Africa,
are so tired to negotiate
with dozens of outfits
to access money that should
legitimately be theirs.
So there has to be a better way.
And I'm here to tell you one better way.
So first of all, how about we stop
beating around the bush
and try to raise 1.7 trillion dollars
for our moral debt to the poor countries?
(Applause)
Can we do that?
Well, yes, we can.
But let's face it,
there is no money to be made
saving the life
of an old woman in Pakistan.
And this is too much money
for philanthropy.
So the money has to come
from publicly-funded
international redistribution.
Now you're looking at me and saying,
"She probably was under
the rock the last few months."
Every country in the north,
starting from the US,
but not ending there,
is cutting international commitment,
not adding to them.
So how can I go and say,
well, how about 1.7 trillion of new money?
So we have to take the money where it is,
which is in the bank accounts
of the richest people on the planet
and the largest
multinational corporations.
Now --
(Cheers and applause)
Before you think I'm,
you know, a dangerous alien,
I'm not talking about expropriation.
The reality is that the richest
people on the planet
do not pay their fair share in taxes.
(Applause)
Warren Buffett, who is no communist,
quipped that he paid less
taxes than his assistant.
And it's true.
But it's not just in the US.
Worldwide, rich people have all sorts
of perfectly legal maneuvers
to avoid paying the same taxes
as everybody else.
Proportionately, they pay less taxes
than anybody in this room, probably,
unless you're a billionaire.
(Laughter)
A tax on the wealth of the 3,000
richest people in the world
of about three percent a year
would raise 400 billion dollars.
A slight increase in the minimum tax
on multinational corporations
from 15 to 21 percent
would raise 300 billion dollars.
I'm not dreaming,
because the tax
on international corporations,
it exists already.
Twenty years ago, it would
have seemed crazy to think
that we could have an agreement,
worldwide, to have such a tax.
And yet, in 2021,
120 countries signed a treaty,
and it's already implemented
by 40 countries.
And what is nice about it
is that it does not require
every single country to participate.
If the US, for example,
doesn't participate,
the way the rules are made,
France and Germany, for example,
can tax the US companies
on their sales in France or Germany
to make sure that overall,
they pay 15 percent on their profits.
We could do just the same
for the billionaires.
France and Germany
could send them a tax bill,
say, to Jeff Bezos,
in the unlikely event that Jeff Bezos
doesn't pay his taxes,
they could start levying money
on Amazon's tax in France.
So this is feasible.
This is already in the conversation.
Brazil put it on the map
during their presidency of the G20.
It made it to the final declaration
with support from many countries,
including France, for example, and Spain,
and with support from some
of the Brazilian richest billionaires.
Thank you, Neto Setubal.
Now
it has also a lot of support.
Seventy percent of Americans
and 80 percent of Europeans
are in support of a tax
on the wealthiest people
to help the poorest people
cope with climate change.
But some people are a little worried
that what would we do with the money
if we managed to raise it?
The climate activists are worried
about international
institutions hogging it,
and the rich countries are worried
about developing countries' governments
using it for their own purposes.
So here is a simple solution.
Send it straight to people.
(Applause)
We know how to do it.
The infrastructure is already there.
Chief of all, here, in Africa,
where almost everyone has
a mobile money account already.
There are more than 100
randomized controlled trials
of cash transfer programs
that show that people use the money well.
And moreover,
the money not only is used well,
but it also helps resilience.
For example, in Zambia,
when people received about 12 dollars
a month in a support income,
not only did it increase
their consumption on average,
but it removed the ups and downs
that they get with drought
and flood usually.
Here in Kenya,
people used a universal
basic income that they had
to finance, first, a better
roof over their head,
and second, solar panels to power a fan,
a pump or a cell phone,
thus increasing resilience
and increasing productivity.
For some countries which are very poor,
there is enough damage money
to fund a UBI for everyone
such that nobody has to live
under the poverty line.
For richer middle-income countries,
there is enough to fund
a sort of insurance
where no one needs to work
when it's 35 degrees outside.
Finding ways to reliably collect money
to pay for our moral debt
to the world's poorest citizens
would do a lot to repair the trust
between the West and the rest.
And it is badly needed,
because the reality is
that the future of climate mitigation
is in the countries that are today poor.
Even if the OECD, even if the US, Europe
managed to reduce their emissions,
unlike the countries 
of Africa, India, etc.
don't get into a crazy trajectory,
the climate fight will be lost.
So the future is here.
And it can only be done if there is trust.
So what we need
is really a new grand bargain
about climate mitigation and adaptation.
What we need is a situation
where every poor country
is entitled to the damages
that our continued emissions
impose on them,
and in exchange of this money
for their citizens,
they commit to forceful climate action,
including potentially
carbon-pricing mechanism.
It's urgent, it's feasible,
it's just.
So all of you here,
especially any billionaire,
either in the room or watching me,
please stand up and demand
a billionaire tax for climate justice.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
