Last week, President Trump signed an 
executive order that would charge companies  
$100,000 dollars for each new H-1B visa 
application. The H1B is the main visa used  
for hiring skilled foreign workers in the 
United States. The announcement triggered  
a wave of panic among foreign workers, confusion 
amongst employers, and a flurry of clarifications  
from the White House. Images were shared online 
of panics at airports as passengers tried to  
disembark airplanes that were ready to take 
off, fearing that if they left the country,  
they might not be allowed to return.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick added to the  
confusion - standing next to Trump at the signing, 
he told reporters that it was an annual charge,  
saying companies would need to decide whether a 
foreign worker was “valuable enough” to justify  
paying a hundred thousand dollars a year to the 
government, in addition to the worker’s salary.
 
Over the next 24 hours, the White House scrambled 
to correct the record. Karoline Leavitt issued  
a three-point clarification, stating that the 
fee was not annual — it is a one-time payment,  
that it applies only to new applications, 
not renewals and that current visa holders  
would not be charged to re-enter the country.
This announcement from President Trump comes  
with a certain irony. During his campaign in 
2020, he praised the H-1B program calling it  
“a great thing” and “something I’ve always 
supported.” Less than a year ago he told a  
podcast – while he was campaigning- that “if you 
graduate from a college, you should get a green  
card with your diploma.” Now, he’s proposing a fee 
which would effectively end the H 1B visa category  
by making it prohibitive for most businesses 
to hire foreign workers in the United States.  
While a lot of the news has been about the tech 
industry - the visas are widely used by the U.S.  
healthcare sector to recruit international 
medical graduates or foreign-trained doctors  
and other professionals trained abroad. 
Universities additionally rely on them  
to hire professors, researchers and postdocs.
Estimates circulated online that the visa fee  
could raise $14 billion dollars a year in revenue 
- but these projections assumed that demand would  
remain unchanged and that the fee would apply to 
annual renewals — neither of which is true. The  
actual revenue is likely to be significantly lower 
as the new rule incentivizes companies to hire  
highly skilled workers at foreign based offices 
instead of bringing them into the United States. 
 
The H-1B visa was created in 1990 as a 
way for U.S. employers to hire foreign  
workers in “specialty occupations” that 
require specific technical expertise.  
It quickly became the go-to visa for companies 
looking to fill roles in software engineering,  
data science, biotech, and other fields where the 
demand for workers exceeds the domestic supply.
 
Each year, the U.S. government issues 85,000 
new H-1B visas — 65,000 go to applicants  
with bachelor’s degrees and 20,000 go 
to those with U.S. graduate degrees.  
Demand is so high that the entire allotment gets 
claimed within 24 hours of the application window  
opening, so, the government then runs a lottery 
to decide who gets a visa. The lottery system is  
not the best approach as it means that a foreign 
graduate with really rare and important skills  
ends up having the same odds of getting a visa 
as someone with more common qualifications.
 
The H-1B visa lasts for three years and can be 
extended to six. After that, workers must either  
leave the country or transition to a green card. 
There is a per-country cap on the number of green  
cards allocated – so, no country can get more than 
7% of the available green cards – this means that  
people from countries with high populations like 
China and India have really long wait times for  
green cards and the only real route into working 
in the United States is through the H-1B visa.  
Once they get a H-1B, these workers are tied to 
their employer – and if they lose their job, they  
have 60 days to find another or face deportation. 
Because of the cap on Green Cards, many Chinese  
and Indian workers find themselves stuck on 
temporary visas – while they try to build lives  
in the US – aware that losing their job could 
quickly lead to deportation. If they have children  
who were born abroad – those children lose the 
right to stay as soon as they become adults.
 
So, let’s look at which firms hire the most 
H-1B workers, whether the fee is legal,  
how this might affect the brain drain in 
emerging markets – and whether it will  
improve job prospects for American workers. 
People talk about the lead crisis in Flint,  
Michigan like it was a one-off event, but most 
tap water is contaminated in one way or another.  
If you're like me and just want boring, clean 
H2O, I recommend purifying your water with today's  
sponsor, Cove Pure. A lot of tap water contains 
microplastics forever chemicals and pharmaceutical  
residue or just doesn't taste as good as it could. 
Sure, you could use a Brida, but that's just a  
cheap carbon filter. Or you could waste money on 
bottled water, which half the time is just tap  
water wrapped in plastic. I'd rather use something 
that actually works. Cove Pure removes up to 99.9%  
of contaminants and sits right on your countertop. 
No installation is needed. You just fill it up and  
plug it in. I've used my Cove Pure for over 
a year and I've noticed a huge difference in  
how my water tastes. Cove Pure gives you instant 
hot or cold water and even lets you set a precise  
temperature. For green tea, boiling water ruins 
the flavor, but one press of a button gives me the  
perfect 185°ree water I need. Clean water is one 
of the best investments you can make. Head over to

In recent years, the H-1B visa program has 
been most heavily used by tech firms. In 2022,  
Amazon was the top H-1B sponsor, 
followed by Tata Consultancy  
Services, Google, Microsoft, and Infosys.
H-1B workers tend to be young, highly educated,  
and willing to relocate. They also tend to 
stay in America if they can. Many go on to  
become permanent residents, start companies, or 
take leadership roles in U.S. firms. Four of the  
seven most valuable public companies in America 
— Google, Microsoft, Tesla, and Nvidia — are led  
by former H-1B holders. So are the CEOs of 
the four most valuable private companies.
 
Obviously with the passing of the Genius 
Act – The United States is focusing more  
on technology like stablecoins, cryptocurrencies 
and other businesses which don’t really require  
the same level of education as was needed 
for things like chip design – so attracting  
scientists and engineers may be less important 
as the focus on this type of business grows. A  
background in Physics isn’t really needed 
to come up with something like Fartcoin.
 
The H-1B visa has been a cornerstone of 
America’s skilled immigration system. It’s  
not perfect — critics say that it’s vulnerable 
to abuse and can suppresses wages — but it has  
helped the U.S. maintain its edge in science, 
technology, and innovation. Highly skilled  
immigration has been key to Americas tech 
and scientific leadership over the years.  
More than 20% of American Nobel prizewinners were 
immigrants. This new fee puts that edge at risk.
 
Supporters of the H-1B program often cite a study 
claiming that each foreign worker hired on an H-1B  
visa leads to the creation of five additional jobs 
for Americans. The logic is that skilled workers  
boost productivity, help companies grow, and allow 
firms to expand their domestic operations. It’s  
worth noting that the five-jobs figure comes from 
a single study and isn’t universally accepted.
 
Critics argue that the visa can suppress 
wages. Outsourcing firms, in particular,  
have been accused of using the program to bring 
in workers at below-market rates. A 2023 analysis  
found that 60% of H-1B jobs were paid below the 
median wage for the occupation. Now this could  
be explained by H-1B visas being held by typically 
younger workers. The Department of Labor requires  
employers to pay either the prevailing wage or 
the actual wage paid to similar U.S. workers —  
whichever is higher — but enforcement is patchy, 
and the fact that it is extremely difficult  
for H-1B workers to change jobs – possibly 
means that employers take advantage of them.
 
The nature of the program is that it 
can both create jobs – when it brings  
in highly skilled workers that help US 
firms to innovate and grow – or it could  
suppress wages, depending on how it’s used.
There’s also disagreement about whether the  
U.S. has enough STEM graduates to meet demand. 
Some studies say yes. Others say no. What’s clear  
is that many STEM graduates in the U.S. end up 
working in unrelated fields. According to one  
report, only about a quarter of Americans with 
STEM degrees actually work in STEM jobs. That  
doesn’t necessarily mean there’s a surplus — it 
could mean that the jobs aren’t attractive enough,  
or that employers prefer foreign workers 
who are more mobile and less expensive.
 
The visa’s defenders say that without access to 
global talent, U.S. companies will struggle to  
compete. Its critics say that the program 
has become a subsidy for firms that don’t  
want to invest in training or pay high wages. 
For decades, U.S. universities have attracted  
top students from around the world. 
The draw wasn’t just the quality of  
education — it was the possibility of staying 
on after graduation, working in the U.S.,  
and eventually settling down. The H-1B visa was 
seen as the bridge between study and citizenship.
 
International students pay high 
tuition fees, often two or three  
times what domestic students pay. Many 
come from countries like India and China,  
where the cost of a U.S. degree represents a major 
financial commitment. The belief was that it was  
a good investment — that a degree from a U.S. 
university would lead to a job at a top US firm.  
The new fee throws that assumption into question.
If the cost of hiring a foreign graduate rises to  
$100,000 – plus a high salary that takes the 
workers skills and qualifications into account,  
many employers will simply stop doing it. That 
means fewer job offers for international students,  
and less incentive to study in the U.S. in 
the first place. American Universities could  
see a drop in applications, especially in 
STEM fields where foreign students make up  
a large share of the graduate population.
There’s also a risk that the fee will push  
students towards other countries. Canada, the UK, 
Australia, and Singapore have all made efforts to  
attract global talent — offering post-study 
work visas, fast-track residency, and lower  
barriers to employment. If the U.S. makes it 
harder to stay, students will go elsewhere.
 
For American universities, the impact could be 
financial as well as reputational. International  
students subsidize the system by paying higher 
fees. They bring diversity, research capacity,  
and global connections. If they stop coming, the 
effects will be felt across departments — not just  
in engineering labs, but in economics seminars, 
business schools, and medical research centers.
 
The H-1B visa was never designed as a student 
pathway, but it became one by default. The new fee  
may close that path making foreign universities 
more attractive to international students.
 
The H-1B visa was designed to bring skilled 
workers into the United States. But if the  
cost of doing that becomes too high, companies may 
simply stop trying. The alternative – especially  
for the biggest firms - is to just hire abroad 
— and increasingly, that’s what they’re doing.
 
During Trump’s first term, visa processing slowed 
down, denial rates rose, and scrutiny increased.  
Firms responded by moving jobs offshore. 
Instead of bringing workers into the U.S., they  
built teams in Canada, Mexico, India, and Eastern 
Europe. This new fee could accelerate that shift.
 
Remote work technology has made doing this so much 
easier. A software engineer in Bangalore can now  
work for a U.S. company without ever setting foot 
in the country. The same goes for data analysts  
in Warsaw, biotech researchers in Singapore, and 
cybersecurity experts in Toronto. The pandemic  
normalized distributed teams. The visa fee gives 
companies another reason to keep them that way.
 
There’s also the question of competitiveness. 
If U.S. firms can’t hire the talent they need,  
they risk falling behind. And if 
the talent goes elsewhere — to  
countries with more welcoming immigration 
policies — the innovation goes with it.
 
The executive order has already triggered legal 
debate- where immigration experts have pointed  
out that visa fees are governed by the Immigration 
and Nationality Act, which lays out specific rules  
for how fees can be assessed. The law allows 
for cost recovery — meaning that the government  
can charge a fee to cover the expense of 
processing applications — but it doesn’t  
authorize punitive pricing. The new fee goes far 
beyond what it costs to review an H-1B petition.
 
The Cato Institute has warned that while 
the fee may lack a clear statutory basis,  
courts could still uphold it. Immigration 
law gives the executive branch wide latitude,  
and past challenges to presidential proclamations 
have had mixed results. In 2020, Trump tried  
to suspend entry for certain visa categories 
during the pandemic. That move was blocked in  
court. But other restrictions have survived.
If the fee is challenged — and most observers  
expect it will be — the case could hinge on 
whether it’s framed as a national security  
measure, a labor market protection, or 
a revenue tool. The administration has  
been vague on that point. Commerce Secretary 
Howard Lutnick described it as a way to ensure  
companies only hire “valuable enough” 
workers. That’s not a legal standard.
 
Until the courts weigh in, the fee 
stands and companies will have to  
decide whether to pay it, avoid it, or fight it.
Just days before the visa fee was announced, the  
Department of Homeland Security carried out the 
largest worksite immigration raid in its history.  
More than 400 agents descended on a Hyundai 
electric vehicle plant in Georgia, arresting 475  
foreign workers. Most of those detained were South 
Korean nationals who had entered the country on  
the wrong type of visa. The raid was coordinated 
with state officials, who blocked roads and  
provided buses to transport the workers.
The factory had — up until that point — been  
hailed as a major success story. Hyundai had 
committed $12.6 billion to the project, which was  
expected to create 8,500 American jobs in a region 
that had struggled with economic stagnation. Local  
governments had spent hundreds of millions 
upgrading infrastructure, deepening ports,  
and building schools and housing to support 
the plant. The raid put all of that at risk.
 
The workers were not undocumented in the 
traditional sense. Many had entered the  
U.S. legally under the visa waiver program or on 
B-1 business visitor visas — both of which allow  
short-term stays for business purposes, 
but not for hands-on labor. Immigration  
attorneys representing the workers said they were 
engineers and equipment specialists brought in to  
install and calibrate highly specialized 
machinery. According to their lawyers,  
it would take three to five years to train 
American workers to do the same work.
 
South Korea is not a low-wage country. It’s a 
close U.S. ally and one of the largest foreign  
investors in American manufacturing. The raid 
triggered a diplomatic backlash. South Korea’s  
foreign minister flew to Washington. Hyundai 
executives were blindsided. Georgia’s Republican  
governor, who had championed the project, declined 
to comment, perhaps partially because his state  
had played a role in the raid. Georgia state 
troopers blocked off roads before the ICE agents  
went in, and Georgia Department of Corrections 
buses were used to take the Korean workers away.
 
The episode exposed a mismatch between American 
immigration policy and industrial policy.  
The federal government wants foreign companies 
to build in America — but its immigration rules  
make it extremely difficult for them to bring 
in the people they need to get the job done.  
It raises the question: is the United States 
still in the business of doing business — or is  
the government just shaking down companies for 
fees, in the style of a third-world country?
 
For decades, the U.S. offered a predictable 
route for skilled migrants: earn a degree,  
secure a job, and work towards citizenship. 
The H-1B visa was the legal instrument that  
made this possible. The proposed fee introduces a 
financial barrier that could exclude some of the  
best applicants from middle-income countries 
where the fee exceeds annual salaries.
 
While this might be bad for the United 
States – it could be good for countries  
like China and India. Talent that once 
left those countries - now might remain.
 
After the 2008 financial crisis, India 
and China absorbed returnees – who lost  
their visas during the slowdown – these 
workers seeded their own tech ecosystems  
at home. Universities hired them. Startups 
scaled with them. Cities like Shenzhen and  
Hyderabad built internal talent pipelines 
that reduced dependence on foreign training.
 
The FT quoted Amitabh Kant – a man who 
helped organize India’s G20 presidency  
a few years ago who argued that this rule would 
“choke US innovation and turbocharge India’s”.
 
He said that “by slamming the door on global 
talent, America pushes the next wave of labs,  
patents, innovation and start-ups 
to Bangalore, Hyderabad and Pune.
 
According to the FT - Adani Group, 
one of India’s largest conglomerates,  
says that they are welcoming H-1B holders 
back to India to apply for roles, touting  
the growing entrepreneurial environment in India.
There is still a trade-off though – Workers who  
move abroad send billions of dollars back 
home in remittances, which support families  
and fund consumption – this flow will disappear 
– or at least reduce - if people stay at home.  
But - retained talent does something that 
remittances can’t: it builds institutions. 
 
The new visa fee may accelerate a shift 
that is already in motion - where countries  
that once exported talent as an economic 
strategy are now investing in retention. 
 
The tech industry has long been one of the 
biggest beneficiaries of the H-1B visa program.  
Its leaders have lobbied for more visas, faster 
processing, and easier paths to permanent  
residency. But since the announcement of the 
$100,000 fee, most of them have gone quiet.
 
There have been no open letters. No coordinated 
pushback. No major statements from the CEOs of  
the companies that rely most heavily on foreign 
talent. The same executives who once warned that  
restrictive immigration policies would drive 
innovation overseas now have nothing to say.
 
There are a few exceptions. Garry Tan, the 
CEO of Y Combinator, called the fee “a massive  
gift to every overseas tech hub” and warned 
that it would “kneecap startups.” Elon Musk,  
who entered the U.S. on a student visa and later 
held an H-1B, has defended the program in the  
past — though he hasn’t commented on the new fee.
The silence may be strategic. CEO’s appear to be  
wary of picking a fight with a White House that 
has shown a willingness to retaliate. Why voice  
your criticism of tariffs openly when dropping 
off a gold trophy for the president can get them  
waived? But the lack of public opposition has 
left foreign workers — and the universities,  
hospitals, and startups that depend 
on them — without a clear advocate.
 
The H-1B fee has exposed a fault line within the 
Republican coalition — between the populist base  
that wants to restrict immigration – no 
matter what the cost - and the tech elite  
that helped fund Trump’s return to power.
On one side are figures like Laura Loomer-  
who seems to have a timeshare on her face 
shared with Kristi Noem - she has spent  
years attacking the H-1B program and 
accusing tech companies of replacing  
American workers with cheaper foreign labor. 
On the other side are people like Elon Musk,  
who has defended the program and credited it with 
helping build companies like Tesla and SpaceX. 
 
The tension came to a head last year when Loomer 
attacked Sriram Krishnan — an Indian-born U.S.  
citizen — after he was named a senior adviser to 
Trump on AI policy. Loomer accused him in a tweet  
filled with grammatical errors and misspellings 
on “The everything app – formally known as  
twitter - of wanting to “remove all restrictions 
on green card caps in the United States”.  
Elon Musk responded by saying that the visa 
program made America strong – adding - “I  
will go to war on this issue the likes of 
which you cannot possibly comprehend.”
 
After that, he didn’t say much... and neither did 
any of the other tech donors who backed Trump’s  
campaign. The MAGA base, meanwhile, has celebrated 
the move as a win for American workers.
 
The tech industry sees immigration as a source 
of talent and growth while the MAGA base see it  
as a threat to wages and national identity. 
Trump is trying to keep both sides on board.  
The fee may be his way of doing that — a 
gesture to the base that doesn’t require a  
full-scale crackdown, but has a similar effect.
The United States has long been the place where  
the world’s best and brightest come to study, 
work, and build companies. The H-1B visa was  
far from perfect, but it was part of that 
promise — a way for skilled workers to  
contribute to the economy, and for employers to 
access the talent they couldn’t find at home.
 
The new visa fee changes the terms of that 
deal. It incentivizes tech and engineering  
firms to expand in other countries — which is 
easier to do today than ever before. It makes  
it harder for medical professionals and scientists 
to move to the United States, and it reduces the  
attractiveness of American universities while 
killing a major revenue stream for them.
 
The deeper problem may be the overall pattern. 
The fee is just one of many policies — quickly  
enacted, inconsistently explained, and often 
revised — that have made the U.S. business  
environment increasingly difficult to navigate. We 
have seen tariffs that seem to change on a week by  
week basis, a 15% tax on AI chip sales to China, 
a push to change the Coca Cola recipe, demands  
for the firing of Intel’s CEO and settlements with 
media companies like CBS and Disney that coincided  
with regulatory approvals. Even the Cracker 
Barrel logo has not avoided presidential scrutiny.  
The Trump administration’s approach is less 
“small government” and more “hands-on” - a  
style that would have scandalized 
free-market Republicans a decade ago.
 
Faced with a business landscape that shifts 
constantly based on executive orders, tweets,  
or handshakes - companies may adopt a wait-and-see 
approach to business planning— delaying hiring,  
investment, and expansion until the rules 
stabilize. That hesitation is costly. It  
slows growth, innovation and undermines America’s 
reputation as a reliable place to do business.
 
The policy might not survive a court challenge. 
It is unlikely to raise the revenue its supporters  
expect. But it has already done something more 
lasting. It has sent a message — not just to  
immigrants, but to investors, students, and 
employers — that the U.S. is no longer as serious  
about competing for global talent as it once was.
That message may prove more  
expensive than the fee itself.
