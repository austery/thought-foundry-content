[Music] hi everybody I'm Nicola tangan the CEO of the Norwegian so wealth fund and today I am in particularly good company with David Rick the CEO of the Pharma giant elil now lail is spearheading as you may know the weight reducing drug Revolution we own more than 1% of the company totaling $8 billion big thanks for coming Dave great to be with you yeah now um the uh gp1 drug sent uh shock waves through the world and now they seems to be curing everything from alcoholism to Alzheimer so why are these drugs so efficient yeah it's well it's certainly been exciting time for the company but also for medical science because this is actually not a very new idea to stimulate glp1 um Lily launched the first glp1 Agonist in 2006 um so almost 20 years ago um but it's a I think a good example of how the technology in medicine works is that often times um we know the sort of the the the major theme but making a molecule making a medicine that behaves with properties that can um achieve optimal outcomes takes time and effort and we're now on our really our third generation of these drugs with tpde which is a dual acting so it's glp plus Gip two different gut hormones you know I think by making drugs that were flat and lasted a long time and then we could dose a little higher we've discovered that um we are not just affecting blood sugar and other you know metabolism factors but affecting probably the brain and the desire but when when when you discovered it in 2005 2006 it was more like a side effect wasn't it the weight production it was a positive side effect in fact a cover of our annual report in 2007 has a woman who took this medicine and she said I'm my diabetes is under control and I'm losing a little weight people say I look better so she noticed it from the beginning it was not the design goal for that drug exenatide it wasn't even the design goal for the follow on to that which was a weekly um medicine called trulicity or dulaglutide it was a designed goal for tepati which is these two act actions for weight loss and whether the weight loss itself has these broad effects you mentioned uh dementia and Alzheimer's and probably the effects there are more vascular so similar to the cardiovascular benefits probably reducing strokes and Min Strokes that needs to be proven but you know those studies are getting done or this desire Center where these these hormones are our our stomach our gut secretes after we eat tell our brain that we're full and that that is also affecting alcohol consumption cigarette smoking other kind of hedonic behaviors humans have so we're also studying those things because um probably in modern society the things that that harm us most are our own behaviors so what are the other honic desires that it can prevent well we know smoking is a very strong signal and you'll see Lily this this year conduct large studies in smoking cessation which is still a major problem uh particularly in Asia um alcohol consumption is something we immediately notied in our studies and if you go back and look you do see people self-reporting pretty significant reductions in alcohol which is also probably good for us um we're also studying street drugs um and so these are more complicated clinical studies to undertake be for all kinds of reasons they're illegal in many countries and dose control and so forth is difficult but that of course is a Scourge particularly in my country in the US the whole opioid crisis has been terrible the probability that works isn't as certain as something like smoking um but I think we need to give it a shot I think that's what Lily's four is to take on big health problems and obesity is a big one but but so is opioid addiction so the Blue Sky scenario here at 10 years from now what could these stke do well I I think you you can certainly see in our sites now I think we have evidence from the last year that not only do you lose weight and for most people who are overweight or obese can get to a healthy body weight on tepati we have more medicines coming by the way we could talk about that for people with even higher body weight or to be more scalable or more convenient but I think we can easily say that weight management will become more like a choice than an Affliction and that's good we can also say that we've learned in the last 15 months that major categories of Downstream disease of obesity are affected by weight loss induced by these drugs that seems obvious but in hindsite but you know it is a key question is not do you just affect the kind of the precondition but actually also the disease cardiovascular risk which has been shown um kidney disease um now uh liver disease Etc so that's important because those diseases make up about 40% of health care costs in in developed economies so that's a blue sky scenario by itself the trick there will be scaling right because right now between Lily and Nova Nordisk we may be serving less than 20 million people on the planet and there might be a billion people with um o overweight or obesity who are going to get these chronic diseases stupid question but why are there as many as one billion obese people why is this increasing so much you know it I think there's a lot of theories it's a multiactor um disease or process but in many ways like a lot of chronic illnesses we have today were actually survival biases of our ancestors and food and nutrients are obviously essential to life so you know when our ancestors were running around in the ice ages and you know looking for food being a hoarder of calories and preserving body weight was a was a survival uh uh bias in our genome now that's actually hurting us because we live in a world of abundance and so I think that's true around the world and as developed economies rise and middle-income countries go to developed and vice and so forth Food Systems food becomes more stable it becomes more abundant it probably is less healthy for us anyway than the foods our ancestors ate um and more tasty and it's harder to resist so there's definitely something wrong in our food system I don't think we should shy away from that conversation but also abundance itself is is part of the problem I think you've said that he cost uh just under three billion dollars to and takes 10 years to discover or to discover a drug now like in two minut is how do you how do you discover a drug yeah well maybe just a step back what what we do is we make new matter new molecules that uh interfere with Biology the two classic problems in drug Discovery are do I know the target am I pointed at the right thing that is causing the disease and then can I drug the target um with maximum effect and minimum side effects and that turns out both those turn out to be very difficult things we probably know 10 15% of all biology so picking the targets is hard and then drugging the targets is even harder most the easy ones have turned into drugs already um and many of those were accidents of nature we we discovered long ago and converted into commercial drugs creating brand new substances um that behave like drugs against known targets is challenging so there's a lot of attrition for both those reasons either the drug isn't good enough or the target wasn't exactly right um so we spend a lot of time and money and there's a lot of failure the biggest cost in drug development is failure um most of the things we start don't actually work but then we also need to pursue drug new medicines in a way that's safe right we can't Market things that are unsafe and we need to have a knowledge base that is evidence that these things work and that takes time and it's pretty serial it's step by step um do most fmer groups uh work the same way when it comes to drug Discovery or have you got a secret way of doing it in general yes although you know in my tene at Lily we've worked hard to do things a little bit differently to improve the productivity of R&D you know if we look at um if we take out the the weight loss companies of Lily and Novo from the sector the the C the sector trades at like 12 times earnings it and that's really because Roi on R&D investment is close to zero and we looked at that and we said that's obviously not not an equation we're happy with and tried to control things we could control it's hard to learn more about biology quickly and it's very difficult to make new drugs just better than others but we worked on two things one was that the time in which we take to make decisions and move and the other is the asset allocation type discussion of how far do you spread your bets how do you make decisions about when to quit um what kind of uh evidence is sufficient to keep going and setting a high bar there for progression so in fact we're actually killing projects earlier than we ever did before and doing so with a higher standard and we're doing it faster what have you done with the time how what's the what's the time spent now compared to when you joined right so the industry averages I can speak and in 2015 when we looked at this we were a little worse than industry average is about 10 years in clinical development so that's first human dose to approval in some market and about four or five years pre-clinically so in total almost 15 years of time by the way our our patent cycle um is we get a 20-year patent but once we exhaust all all that time we end up with like 10 or 12 years in market so this explains I think in large part why return on investment in our sector is so poor because it takes you longer to develop a new thing then you get to harvest the benefit of the thing you just invented so we sought to change that we've cut the preclinical time roughly in half it takes us about two and a half years to go from idea to First dose and then about six years last year 5.9 years to go from first dose to approval so that's almost half the time of our peers which is an enormous structural Advantage we have if we can repeat it what was the key to getting there I mean these are very big numbers yeah two things one is just good old-fashioned kind of process engineering basically doing everything you can in parallel that puts some Financial Risk in our process but just to give a small example a lot of like biotechs will wait till they get compelling pre-clinical evidence in animals their drug is working before they run production and figure out production to do to make doses for a first human study and then that production scale up part is on your critical path we really don't do that anymore we make we do that for everything and then we just stop working on it if the if the drug isn't working in animals so we basically pull timelines forward and do parallel processing versus Cal that's a big tool and there's many other examples of that in the system of making new drugs another one is decisionmaking time so we used to like do an experiment and then all gather around and ask new questions and look at it and reprocess the data and it was taking us sometimes nine to uh nine weeks to six months to move from step one step to another we really don't do that anymore now we pre-specify what we need to see to advance by the way that improves decision quality and if we hit that Target we just go the next day if we miss the target we pause um sometimes we re interrogate the data and we end up going but most of the time it's sped up our decision-making is this all strictly analytical or is there an element of gutfield to these decisions there's judgment too right as I said because we only know a certain amount of biology human pattern recognition and experience is very important on the experience side I think Lily does also have a structural Advantage you know we used to get made fun of because we're based in Indianapolis and sort of far away from other drug companies but one of the effects of that is people stay here a long time living in this part of the country is easy and people tend to our average tenure for scientists at the company is over 10 years that gives people enough time to see the process repeat itself and begin to recognize patterns versus jump to another company I think that's helped us along the way and then having great people like like you know our our our lead scientists in the company Dan gansy and his team who are just good at recognizing patterns and are very good at abstracting personal um preferences from the process and I think like all capital allocation that's a key thing in your business I'm sure you see that as well you you have to be dispassionate about ideas and in big companies particularly in our industry that's been a problem people want to work on the projects that they think the leader like and that ends up in pretty bad decision making so how many like super key people would you have when it comes to picking the right projects at the end of the day everyone's key but probably at the leadership level in Lily research Labs there's 20 to 30 people that are making the core decisions across all therapeutic areas how does AI help you or will help you yeah it's already helping us in many ways and I think I'm a really positive you know optimist about AI not in our only in our sector but in all sectors you know on the drug Discovery side there's a lot of hype about companies that are forming and say we'll just turn on a computer and write some code and we'll invent new drugs I do not think we're close to that um that wet lab validation and having really strong data sets to make predictions is critical more likely Ai and what we're using it for now is a much more graner tool to predict IND idual experiments in some cases don't even conduct them because we don't think they're worth it the drug won't succeed and knocking things out earlier or enhancing experiments with synthetic data and enriching sort of how we look at those results that's already happening now but these are micro steps in drug development versus some sort of magic um turn on a machine and make it happen all at once but that makes our scientists move faster and makes their their their um laboratory experience more valuable um and I think both those things are helping us today in the end I'm excited about the use of um generative and diffusion models to help our chemists so chemistry is a particularly difficult part of what we do the chemical space is vast like 10 to the 60th so it's more stars than are in the universe kind of possibilities and humans are pretty constrained in our thinking so like when you use uh chat gbt or dolly or one of these tools to make a silly image or something and it comes up with something odd and creative the machine does that with chemistry as well that's not going to be a drug but it gives our chemist new starting points that they didn't consider before and I think that's that long term is going to be very interesting for our sector and then there's many other parts like other industrial companies were already scaling Ai and it's making a very large difference one of the most important ones last year was in produ uction optimization so we have we're scaling our gp1s as you know and that's been a key constraint to growth of the company with like one small intervention we did introduced about an 8% process effic efficiency in a key bottleneck in production it allowed us to ship about seven or eight% more product last year in that line and as you know that's worth hundreds of millions or maybe a billion dollars in Revenue so when you have implemented AI fully in all parts of the company how much quicker will your process I think we could cut times in half again if we're successful there are some things that are real constraints because like disease processes many of the ones we study are slow and there is no replacing um the watching of someone on a drug or not on a drug take like Alzheimer's disease this is a seven-year process from diagnosis to death and we need to study a meaningful part of that to prove a medicine is working there's no getting around that human disease process but many of the other things that lead up to that final study we could potentially do much quicker and I'd be I'd be excited to see that happen how much easier is the whole uh process uh to do in the US compared to Europe drug Discovery and development yeah it's not that different actually between the two markets we have huge operations in Europe as we do in the US those are our two centers for both production and science clinical trials as well as Discovery probably more Discovery in the US and um proportionately more clinical trials in Europe the thing that's different in the is the market side so the adoption of technology in Europe is super slow in the US is quite a bit faster and I that's a problem for us in terms of our interest in the European continent because we are on the clock with our patent life and if a meaningful part of that is absorbed with the government processes to get a drug approved and get it uh on formularies in countries and then go through procedures at the hospital level to get used it's really a waste um for for us but also for patients who can't access the the medicine from your start a pro uh a project until you start to sell the drug what's the time difference between Europe and the US well everything's the same up until submission we typically submit in the US first and then within a few weeks into Europe it's normal for us to have approval in Europe three to four months after um this is in the EU after um the US and then the a way to think about it is what's your average time to real patient access on the ground and in Europe that's a little over two years post approval so it's the four months plus 24 more months so here we're you know almost out to two and a half years later and that's painful because it's slow but it's worse even than that because what that means is you have two and a half years less out of 10 to 12 years to commercialize your product so it's really a drag on um on value creation for us and the Healthcare System we think the medicines we make are valuable for the healthcare system and patients that's a tax on that as well is Europe doing anything to rectify this situation there's discussions about it we've had a lot of dialogue in the European Parliament about the access differences between the 27 member states and um most of what's come out of that are sticks not carrots we'd like to see incentives for countries to move faster and even an idea that why don't we presume coverage and then eliminate drugs that are less valuable through the process and and red tape versus the other way around right now most European countries presume no value for new drugs and then go through a process to see if there's any value and I think that's the fundamental issue plus you know it's a it's a national competence running your Healthcare System and there's National differences that are difficult to work through uh I wish I was an optimist about reducing European bureaucracy I'm not what about China what's the situation in China the reverse frankly so you I used to run our Chinese business about 15 years ago and at that time the drug lag between the US and China that's what we would call that patient access so if it's two and a half years for Europe at the time it was seven years for China so medicines we were launching had been launched seven years ago in the US right now that lag is coming down to less than 12 months so already China has Lea frogged over Europe in the drug lag and their goal is to be the first place we launch things in the world so they're ambitious as they can be their regulatory system has improved dramatically and almost harmonized with um the major other Regulators like EMA in Europe FDA and Japan in terms of standards and review times it's still a little slower on Market access it's a calendarized process so if you launch on January 5th um you actually cannot get on the formularies until January of the next year so that's a problem if you launch on December 5th you get you can get on in a few months so uh we like to see that changed but they they've made a lot of strides uh in kind of modernizing their health system and what about the drug Discovery coming out of gy yeah it's tremendous uh those are both collaborators and competitors for all major companies and I pay Keen attention to those developments there are some scaled um biotech companies there many of which we are partnered with in China and outside of it there are emerging um small biotech um clusters there mostly working on known targets so if you go back to what I said what are the two problems in drug development what's the right Target and then can I make a good medicine that only hits that Target they're mostly working on that second problem and I think that leads to more me better me too kind of drugs and that's probably part of any country um building an Innovative ecosystem um eventually they're going to have to work on discovering new targets which mostly happens in the west now but um you know I I bet they'll be a leader in that too they have tremendous scientific capabilities now you have a business background right yeah what do you think you do differently compared to if you had had a far more background well I I think the people say background I mean we could I spent you know four years in undergrads studying engineering business and then two years getting an MBA but I've spent 28 years working in a Pharma company so I probably know a lot more about the pharmaceutical industry in all parts than I would about a general business thing just because I study it in school I'm a big believer in continuous learning and I spend a lot of time on that myself and I think curiosity is a fundamental leadership trait because it allows you to grow but it also is infectious you know people who work with me I think notice what I spend time learning and they want to learn and that becomes part of the culture of the company and I think a company at scale that can learn faster than others is going to be a better company so um there's a trickle down to that and plus I love learning so I I often I think surprise people when I'm sitting in scientific meetings asking detailed questions I read ahead I don't know I don't have a fundamental biology basis but I learn a lot about a few things uh that are highly relevant to our business scientifically and I enjoy that and I think that's helped us uh perform better how do you permeate that culture of learning into the organization I think you know like a lot of things that scale it's a it's a little bit of everything but one of the things I've noticed in my career um whether it be leading a bus like our operation in China or even a smaller group earlier in my career as the CEO is um we can do a lot of things intentionally but um those aren't the always the things that make the biggest difference I think people pay attention in two other things what are your daily habits and the culture is not what's on the slide or you know the words in the lobby it's what people do and people notice what leaders do and they particularly notice what leaders do when they're under pressure you know what is when things are going wrong what do you do and so I think having that curious mindset you know as Satia nadela my friend says is you know a learn it all versus know- itall kind of culture um is one of those indirect things that flows through the company and I think it also makes work joyful to me uh so you know that that's something that we bed here at Lily and probably have well before I got here but but have continued so what does uh David rcks do when he's under pressure I drive speed you've talked about that here I mean I think um getting all the facts on the table are important but then acting with some emergency is important um no choice is a choice um and I think moving is important um I think it's important also to hear I really value the direct knowledge and so quite often um people who work with me get frustrated because I'll ask to talk to the people actually doing the thing um at the most basic level and um often those people are they're very specific on their test but I kind of I really want to know what's happening and why and then you know I think it's important to get an outside perspective before you move forward and often I'll spend time I think particular for CEOs we have to a lot of outside voices um and I spent a lot of time on that um but you know you mentioned sa Adella who uh you know has been on the podcast and we recommend you to listen to that but another one is the CEO of adobe where you on the board yeah Ryan he's a good friend of mine and one of the reasons I joined that board is I have so much respect for him and when I was a new CEO just and joining another company board one of the most important things to me was learning in the boardroom especially bit even outside of that from a veteran and shotu had been in that uh seat for about nine years at the time and one of the it's interesting you know in the US model we we have more of a chair CEO combo roles but that I was much more equipped to be a CEO than a chair when I got that job um and I really had never run a board or spent much time in one um and he really helped me with that in in a lot of ways what are the other things you've learned from Adobe which you have implemented Tech Cadence and the way Tech drives business value through continuous Improvement our industry is more about these tidal wave improvements you know these big step functions we talked about gop1 which is obviously a mega um kind of innovation wave in in the pharmaceutical sector Tech has those two but like we've seen recently with AI but they also are very good at grinding out lots of incremental wins and doing it at a Cadence that is measured in months and weeks not years and I think that's something Pharma could really learn from sometimes incremental improvements create a lot of value um and we don't set ourselves up our wheel is turning on that 10 to 14e clock we talked about earlier not on the six-month um so we've tried to do some of those things both with the product itself that you buy at the pharmacy but also some of the old other tangental products a good example of that is is the service you get from procuring our medicine um you know we've stood up in the US and now four other markets a direct Pharmacy model so we're selling directly to Consumers and why are we doing that because that's actually people attribute that experience to the medicine as well so we can innovate in a different way because it's not a medicine a physical thing it's a digital product um and I think that's helping change our company in important ways I mean that's an idea that came came to us through through some of the work with the tech Partners what are the other ways you can get higher Tech Cadence into a large company well I think being being more able to begin with right so you know one of the things about tech companies is that because they don't have a physical product they're changing bits not atoms they can move at a different speed because that's how that's how software works the more software enabled our systems are actually the faster we can make changes versus Hardware enabled so I I think that's a key insight and um you know I think examples of that could be like in our production systems about 10 years ago we started moving to a much more digitally controlled and um kind of more multimodal control of our production systems versus fixed kind of operations so we can make changes to input parts to process design to regulatory requirements through software now uh not by actually reconfiguring physically lines I think that's an important type of example of that or if let's just say we get to 50% of our pre-clinical laboratory experiments are predictive in silico not in wet lab we can make those moves much more quickly as well so they have a built-in Advantage because they work in the world of atoms not bits or bits not atoms the more we get to bits the better that said a business based on atoms is has a bigger moat right because your competitors also have those same sticky difficult problems to make physical products to scale them to make them work in the physical world we're not abandoning that that's actually our core strategic advantage but I think combining the two could be super powerful and then there's a cultural piece about expectations that comes from software which is this incredible sense of urgency because you can just get displaced at any moment um and I think sometimes farmer companies get a little complacent because it's hard to displace what we do moving on to um pricing what is the most difficult ethical dilemma you are facing when it comes to affordability versus profits yeah I think we have many ethical dilemmas in our business because health is so personal and there is an ethos around universal healthcare this is a core one there are others too I would say but um what is a fair return for an innovator and I think there's H brackets on that um one perspective which had been pursued by the industry we don't pursue is that you know it's what the market will bear I I think that probably steps across ethical lines for many actors in the health system system and we we actually don't pursue pricing that way but you can imagine desperate people who are um need a medicine to survive um you can get into uh price points that are really exorbitant um and maybe make a short-term return but you'll probably be either legislated or um um sued out of business if you pursue that forever um you know there's on the other Spectrum there's a marginal cost plus take all input costs including research and we'll add something to it but I think the the risks that fails to account for the risks in our business which are very significant compared to other um established businesses and the the return on that risk as you would know needs to be substantial because um things can go wrong they don't go wrong quickly so the problem we have in explaining that Nikolai is is it just seems like everything's okay tomorrow and the next day and the next day um they go wrong slowly and then all of a sudden and that's the patent cycle problem we faced right so once a drug has been proven and is widely distributed and is helping millions of people that's when those arguments come in of oh Cost Plus but we wouldn't have had the thing to begin with because no one would have undertaken the risks to invent it we pursue more of a value approach what is the displacement of other costs in the Healthcare System certainly we deserve credit for that and then what is the value creation beyond that that that can occur you know for instance with our weight loss drugs there's emerging evidence that absenteeism drops in the workplace when people are on them maybe that's because reduced alcohol consumptions or other health factors there's indirect things like joint and knee pain drop so hip replacements and knee Replacements are slowing in populations using our drugs well we probably should get some credit for that as well so you know our idea is that we capture some not all of the direct and in indirect value we create during the patent period and then we remind policy makers that one of the great gifts of our industry is that everything we pursue everything we invent goes to zero for us and goes to Infinity for society because generic drugs are such a great deal for Health Care Systems we invented Prozac you know 40 years ago it's a standard of care globally for treating major depressive disorder it costs in major markets about four or five cents a day it's virtually free and I think that's a tremendous gift to society we don't claim we don't want credit uh for that directly but we I think deserve more credit on patent because of that so now you and I we come out of the lab we've discovered GP 1 we we're pretty pleased right uh and we realize that this is going to lead to less people being aw from the jobs less alcoholism all that kind of thing now who's around the table when we decide how to price it I mean it's an evolutionary process but we begin with the outside in we talk to Health Systems directly and understand how they think about it we look at at our data sets so around the table before we walk out of the labs is well what could this medicine do and how do we in a full way try to capture analytically those benefits and sometimes we do a good job of predicting those things in the case of gp1s or incron we've not done a great job because we undershot I think the broad benefits of these medicines so then we look at real world evidence and work backwards there was an important study we were part of at the Veterans Administration in the US that came out two weeks ago that looked at all these non-metabolic factors and showed benefits for you know schizophrenia for major depressive disorder for alcoholism Etc and so then we quantify that and then you know we we ask ourselves what's a fair share of the value we've created some of these values are quite certain some of them are uh probabilistic and so we make estimates about that and we try to form a price perspective that way so Financial people are there scientific people are there and people who talk to customers are there there talking about people being away from from work so we take more medicine than before we are in a way more healthy than before but yet um sickness leave is just going up right in this country it's I think we are hitting 7% why why is sickness leave going up when we are becoming healthier well I I don't have a a clear answer for that I think in when you're talking about your country Norway is that what you're talking about the 7% yeah in the US it's it's it Rose a lot during Co it seems to be coming down a little bit now but one thing a lot of experts point to is mental health so um while we we are better at addressing physical health than ever before life expectancy in most countries is rising the US is an exception we can talk about that if you'd like even with the background Rising obesity rates so I think if we took obesity out of that they'd be rising even faster because cardiovascular risk will certainly be reduced dramatically when we can use these medicines at scale but people are spending more time alone they're spending more time in front of screens we probably are not a healthier species for being alone and in front of screens and um particularly in young people we have to worry I think a lot about this trend um and even in the workplace We're alone in in front of screens more and I think that's a problem and we could talk about the back to work kind of vibe that's going on in the world now but um I think one of the main reasons to do that is to have a a mentally healthy Workforce how would you describe the corpa culture at El yeah we talked about curiosity I think that's a core Hallmark and as a scientifically driven organization has been in our our ethos for a long time and I think it is an interesting place because we have also a very high rigor standard on technical matters but most people who come to work here from other companies describe us as very humanistic as well both in thinking about the products we make which of course are in healthcare and that's a very Human Experience but also with each other I people talk about Lily nice you know and I think we're a very um we have a very high standard for being cordial and respectful so how would I so how would I how would I see that so now I'm come to visit you and I walk around in the corridors what's the kind of uh what's the feeli well you might jump into a meeting room and see people vigorously debating uh data sets or statistical analysis methods on something or manufacturing output numbers or a financial goal and at the same time not raising their voices and um in the weekends you know going to a football match for their kids next to each other because we're in a small City so there's a lot of cordiality what's that's not perfect I'm not those are very not those things to me make for a great place to work but and I think it it compels one important Advantage I should talk about which is teamwork so I think as company scale one of the most um difficult things to fight is bureaucracy and what is that at its core it's the building up of systems and processes that get in the way of the work when they were designed to do the work and here I think we have a good way to cut through that which is relationships both with the longevity and tenure of our employees and this feeling of it's okay to talk to anybody you know on my way to this interview seven or eight people talked to me in the cafeteria when I picked up my cup of coffee and just ask how my day was going ask about a business matter Etc this isn't a place where the CEO is like a scary person you don't speak to and neither is anyone else and I talk to people like what are you working on and how is that interesting it's it's good that way but one of the things that cordal that sort of sense of respect and openness can have is sometimes it can just be a surface thing and that sometimes conflict can be important to produce new insights and results and that's something in my tenure we've tried to introduce in a structured way is like can we have conflict and we do it through little gimmicks like appointing devil advocate in in meetings and having um like one one of our most important decisions Nikolai is when we decide to go from phase to the middle phase of development to phase three when we do that you mentioned the $3 billion dollar two-thirds of that cost is the last step so when we go we better succeed and we actually have a structured process where you assign a team to be a contrarian to basically defeat every argument the proponents are making to advance and they write it down and so decision makers are we force ourselves to read that and consider the alternate point of view but those are newer things to us and I think in the past um we've been I think too nice to each other and made mistakes and it's made us less productive what's the key to fighting bureaucracy I think I mentioned one I think relationships and getting down to um making the or chart and the process work for you not against you and the way it can work against you is people only go to those things right in a way it should be the back up to organic problem solving and uh self-organization one of my habits is when people escalate to me which they do less and less uh over the years is I ask them what they've done already to solve the problem with their peer and often people don't have a good answer to that and I think in big companies leaders like to problem solve it's probably how we got our jobs right is we were the best one at fixing things and in a way leadership can be an amorphous kind of challenging space to sit in and I find myself I'm a Problem Solver I I I kind of when people come to me like oh this isn't working how do we fix it I feel myself instinctively wanting to help them but in a way that creates bureaucracy if if things only get solved when they go up that's a kind of definition of hierarchical bureaucracy so we have to fight against our own impulses um and the the fact that bureaucratic companies often the most satisfied person is the leader of it not the people in it and I think it should be the reverse I think leaders should be sort of worried about the chaos and the less the organic nature of how things are working maybe satisfied with the results but a little uh concerned they don't see and know everything I think that would be a better state for me than and the company than than knowing everything and solving every problem that surely will sub optimize lowly are you a better leader now than when you were younger oh yeah for for sure in what way are you still young young and all that but I mean in what ways yeah I I I feel young but my kids point out I'm not young um but I think probably there's two steps in my career that I'm sure many people at the top organizations have come up against that were really like aha moments the first one is when you move from a version of what I just spoke about being sort of running a team being a manager we all get to that but then you running the management in a way where you're The Hub and those the people are the spokes and then you get to a job where the scale of it no longer supports that where basically you realize your job is actually to help people sometimes the managers underneath you sometimes the people on the front line actually do the work and create an environment where they can be more successful and you need to focus on like Clarity of what we're the goals are not getting to the goals themselves on Staffing the team with people who can function at high level together um not correcting their individual behaviors um you know so to me that happened when in my first general manager assignment I was running Canada which is a midsize market for us and for the first year I tried to solve every problem myself we missed our goals most of my team was very frustrated with me and I was frustrated with me and I had a moment with one of my reports the person running the sales group for me and you know we we both like were doing their end of- year review and we agreed neither of us were successful and that was like Epiphany for me is like I need to make fundamental changes the second one was when I got to the job before this I was running a big part of Lily and I realized that a lot of the value creation at Senior Management is outside the company is really understanding where your organization fits in the world and being and and helping the company refine its effort against that I think inside people want to do a lot of things because they think they're good but actually the world only values a few things that you do and of course we have to do many activities to to produce those few things but lining up kind of your wood behind one Arrowhead is like a key Act of strategic choice but is really only possible when you're in a senior position and you need to spend more time on that than you think and it's frustrating because you have to sift through a lot of conversations that don't matter to get to that but um you can form an opinion about that and make a big difference if you can really see how you can win and produce value for customers and and Society by focusing and I think that's that's something else I've tried to take into this job many of the things you talked about involves um speed um and kind of time schedules and so on is speed a mindset yeah for sure how do you work on it well it's a mindset for leadership and I think one of the things I embraced and talked to my team about is of the things that we can affect as Management in a complicated business like ours multi-disciplinary decade long development Cycles highly regulated etc etc etc the speed at which we choose to move is is a choice of management it's how what objectives we set the culture we create are decision tolerance for Perfection so we can make choic is without Perfection those are all three levels levers we can pull and go a little bit faster and in many ways companies that are seen as slow I would say the first place we should look as is at the leadership of the company um so to me it's it's a it's a lever you can pull to create value that almost always works and is mostly a function of management changing things too fast can be a danger um it's we talked about drug development earlier and we we undertook a four or fiveyear change management process so we didn't break things as we sped up that we did them we we we changed our business process to develop drugs in a methodical way but with a goal on speed and importantly when we did it we really focus the teams because people can say okay we did have a goal at the start to cut drug development time in half and when we first announced that the Lily teams looked at that and said you guys are crazy we're going to hurt people we're we're going to offend Regulators we may never produce a new drug again you know like this will break things but interestingly what actually changed I think it is important to have those so-called you know hairy and audacious goals um to really because if you start with a 10% goal you get to eight or something you know so I think if we really were going to get there we needed something longterm but the incremental change philosophy we adopted was basically to beat the last time even if it was just by 1% so an example is like it used to take us about half a year from when we got a phase three result to submit to the first regulator and the last time we set a record which was last year on on Zep Bound for obesity um it was measured in days so we compress that process by 80 plus percent but we did not do it by saying cut 80% out of the process we we did it over the course of four or five years by saying the new goal for the company is the fastest the last team move that the last team moved and so if someone if it was 180 days if they did 120 that was the new goal for everyone and then people wanted to beat it because they wanted to be the best and it created this positive kind of always getting better continuous Improvement mindset that I think was super helpful and driving change at scale uh in time very interesting um quick question you uh you mentioned um um you in the beginning being about a CEO o than chair uh you may know we Advocate that the chair and the COO should not be the same person why why do you think we are wrong on that I think look I think there are successful models successful companies with both models I I don't prejudge um a structure and some of it could be contextual industry and person specific actually I I know some CEOs who probably shouldn't be chairs and some cosos who should be chairs and not CEOs um I believe in our sector because our time Horizon is so long there are benefits in uniting the role I think the the pure you know the word chief executive officer on execution is an important role but marrying that to the long-term agenda is particularly important it can work and does work in many companies we have many European peers where they have the role divided and I know there's a very tight linkage between the chair and the CEO said that the execution agenda is aligned to the long-term agenda but as you know well from investing in many companies probably on the list of mistakes CEO chairs or CEOs can make is sacrificing the shortterm for the long term and I think that's particularly true in a scien driven R&D intensive industry like ours we're allocating resources this year we'll later this week announce our guidance on R&D spend and we are solving for 2035 to 2040 so I could easily drive earnings in a very differentiated way by reducing R&D spend over the long term and in that period it's well beyond my tenure at the company I won't be here in that period of time but here I think uniting those things helps solve that a little better it saves a little bit of time and agenda planning with the board and the downside is you can end up with too much power in one role and you need compensating structures for that strong other executive team members and a lead independent director who has real Sway in the boardroom we have those things um a few personal questions at the end what you wake up in the morning usually between 5:30 and 6 yeah and what depending on my time zone but at home yeah what you I I typically do exercise for 30 minutes um I try to mix that up between uh getting my heart rate up or just uh resistance and increasingly I've added a lot of flexibility so I started doing like yoga twice a week because I'm getting older and I like to move most all my hobbies involve being outside and moving so um it'll be a sad day when I can't do that I know that'll come someday but I'm trying to prolong that as long as possible it also clears my mind and wakes me up a bit then I have a cup of coffee and I read four papers and apart from papers what do you read um I read scientific journals as we talked about I get typically like I'm a Believer in like what you'd call T style leadership so sort of running the horizontal of your company but usually once a qu one topic a quarter I try to go pretty deep on like go down to the the bare metal um and so um at the moment I'm trying to learn a little bit more about um some particular AI uh features and so I was reading um and playing around with some of the models that are out there that that can affect our industry um and I'll read about that in the morning if I have time before going to work after lately I've been reading more papers because there's a lot of news that seems to be happening every night so uh trying to stay on top of that but I will take time to read read about a topic of interest to me you read fiction only on vacation I I wish I could read I enjoy reading for pleasure but I find myself tired of reading by the time I get home at the end of the evening I mostly consume words for a living and uh verbally and in writing and it's yeah it's fatiguing so I'll tend to spend time with my wife I go to bed early um sometimes I'll do a little pre-work for the next day and music yeah love all kinds of music I have a eclectic playlist um I grew up as a percussionist playing drums in my my youth and I enjoyed Jazz at the time so I I like that when I'm actually and that's a type of music I can listen to when I'm working it doesn't seem to distract me as much um and I enjoy popular music and other forums that's something I share with my kids we have a a running family playlist that people curate and you can listen to at any time if you want the latest thoughts from the family so that's a fun way we stay connected our kids are out of the house and it's a way we can stay you know in touch with each other's preferences that's cool and um last question what is your advice to young people uh yeah I think two things I would say one is um kids grow up today and I've watched my kids grow up and you know impulses as a parent with a lot of resources or to control a lot of things and I think if I compare that to how I grew up which was very random I mean I think I had a lot of latitude in free time I had my first job at the of like 11 I was like a paper boy and I ran a business cutting grass and most days my parents had no idea where I was until like dinner time and I see just so much structure uh for our children now and I I worry for them as adults and when they come to the workplace I think I see this pattern of like let me plan out like what I'm supposed to be doing and I encourage young people to be open to opportunity and open to surprise and uh to quick Side Story But like you know I'm at Lily 29 years almost now and I joined the company for only one reason because my wife was studying medicine at Indiana University and I needed a job in Indiana I I did not come here to be the CEO or even come to the pharmaceutical industry I just fell in love it with it when I got here and I found I was good at certain parts of it and and I think I've done okay and and really enjoyed my career and I think if we're so scripted about things those those things will never happen um so that's that's one thing and this the second um is actually about the inperson part is you know take time to have lunch with different people and learn about everything we do um I think uh education and knowledge is expanding at an exponential rate and we're creating more experts through schooling but fewer generalists and I find joy in the generalist part uh in the connecting the dots between disciplines and I think it's important for people to just in a company where we have engineers and business people and um and chemists and biologists there's so much verticality to that it's important to connect the parts well these are great um pieces of advice I would argue You' done way better than okay you've been a huge success and thank you wow your company has produced some incredible things and well done for staying Indiana that was for sure the right choice me but big thanks for joining us and uh please keep up the good work thank you so much great to be with you today
