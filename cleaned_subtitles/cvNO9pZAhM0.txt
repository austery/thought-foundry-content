Two and a half
years ago, before AI became a big deal.
There was, I want to say, 20
600GW, in the interconnection queue.
And we were expecting 80% of
that would never actually be constructed.
Only 20% of it would.
And that's pretty typical.
Even on a going forward basis.
What are you going to do
with those projects and with those,
that land that has already started
in the process of interconnection
studies and the like?
Well, you can shift that to,
data centers,
especially because a lot of that
you are producing solar
or batteries, wind and other power gen.
Now you add on the data center
layer to it.
And what may not have been economic before
now is.
Should I build a data center job? Yeah.
And I've got a grid connection.
I've got water and yeah,
there we go. Okay.
Next project
our lots builds a data center.
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal.
And I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy, you know, we've obviously been
doing a lot about data centers,
but one thing that's sort of becoming
interesting is they're just
they just seem so complicated.
There are so many different moving parts.
And I don't mean like technically
complicated, although that's part of it.
But they really are this sort of weird
thing where they're a high tech thing.
They have the most advanced chips,
or at least
some of them have the most advanced chips
in the world.
They're real estate plays,
and we talk about securitization
and so forth,
and then they have
to figure out all the stuff of how
they're going to connect to the grid, and
maybe they're going to build their own
power plant inside the data center, etc..
There's a lot of moving parts.
Yeah, there's a couple of things here.
So number one,
it does seem to be a complex space.
And whenever I think about how
some of these things are being financed,
I get that.
What's the meme with the guy
standing in front of the board
with like all the papers and stuff?
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
It all feels a little circular
sometimes, like a whole ecosystem.
But the other thing is just the sheer
scale
of the like,
financing requirement for doing this.
So I was reading a Morgan Stanley report.
I think it came out over the summer.
They were forecasting 2.9 trillion
of global data center spend through 2028.
And just for context, total CapEx
spending by all companies
in the S&P 500, in 2024 was 950 billion.
That's crazy. Yeah. And by the numbers.
The numbers are mind boggling.
Well, the other big question is
if you actually stack that up against
existing revenue from generative AI,
existing revenue is like 16 billion.
Yeah. Right.
So there's like there's a bit of a gap
there that needs to be filled.
Who's gonna.
Right. Completely completely correct.
The other thing.
That strikes me as very interesting
and tricky is you have these projects
and, you know,
you put out that big capital,
capital outlay, capital commitments, etc.,
and then the timelines like,
oh, when do you get connected to the grid?
When does that turbine for your inside
gas generator
get actually get delivered,
maybe 20, 30, etc..
So it feels like I get the impression
you're dealing with very uncertain
timelines.
And so how you, establish
that in the language.
So everyone feels protected. Like,
what if you could ever get connected?
What, if anything can happen?
What are. The expectations
for when this actually starts to pay. Off?
When it does pay off, what are the
obligations of the tenant, etc.?
We don't really know. Anyway,
I'm sure it's different.
Number one, so many more questions
or just scratching the surface.
Yeah, absolutely.
And, you know, there have been
some interesting things happening.
So, a lot of the activity has been done
in the private market,
but obviously AI players and companies
have a lot of different options.
So, you know,
they could go to securitized markets.
And I think we've been seeing some CMBS
and ABS deals there.
Private credit
I mentioned private equity, bank lending.
Or they can go
the public route into corporate bonds.
And so I'm really curious
how a lot of these players are choosing
between those options.
Well, I'm really excited to say
we have the perfect guest.
Someone who is really at the intersection
of sort of every
one of the things that these, data centers
are also at the intersection.
We're going to be speaking to Travis
Wofford.
He's a partner at the Law firm Baker
Botts
Here is a chair of the corporate
department based in, Houston.
He works on all of these things.
He can tell us what's in the, what's in
the details of all these agreements.
So, Travis,
thank you so much for coming on blog.
It's great to have you here in studio.
Thanks for having. Me.
What do you give us?
Just a quick overview
of what's your role at Baker Botts.
What do you focus on?
What what do you call your practice area.
Is that a.
Yeah.
Yeah a. Legal term. Yeah.
So I'm a deal lawyer.
I help people build, buy
finance and sell projects in companies.
And so we take multidisciplinary teams
and put them together in order to actually
make people's dreams a reality, is the way
I like to explain it.
The idea is somebody comes to us
with a very complex project and they need,
an integrated solution, legal solution
to that problem.
So you want to build a data center.
You've got power.
You need people that actually understand
the air, the water, the interconnection
with the fiber, the interconnection
with power, the land, everything else.
And then the finance layer on top of that,
we provide a one stop shop for that.
Okay.
So my question is
how busy are you right now?
Are you just getting, you know, requests
flying at you constantly?
Yes, we're we are very busy.
Which is a good thing.
And it's a bad thing, right.
Because you you're capacity constrained,
just like your clients are.
My husband is a former lawyer,
so I know how bad it can be.
Yes, but the good thing is,
they're interesting deals.
It's interesting stuff to work on.
It's in the news on Bloomberg as well.
And that makes it fun.
It seems like a baker bonds with, like,
the long history based in Houston
and all the energy stuff.
I mean, I think this is all sort of novel
to everyone, right?
Especially the generation
of the generative AI data center.
Like,
that aspect is just a couple of years old.
Can you talk about
when there is a new thing
that everyone gets excited about,
that maybe even a couple of years ago
no one was talking about?
Now, granted, I know data centers
have a lot longer than a couple years old,
but the explosion of interest,
how do you build that sort of team
that understands all of the dimensions?
So that you can provide that one stop shop
service?
Yeah. So it's it's a really good question.
And, you know,
I always go back to the expression,
there's nothing new under the sun when you
actually think about what we're doing.
You're building a power project.
You're building out,
a data center or the powered shell
or the powered land or the like.
People have been doing that before.
When you're financing
these, we're actually using a lot
of the same financing structures.
It may not be exactly the same,
but it rhymes.
So, in the ten, 20 years ago,
we were doing whole business
securitizations of cell towers,
that same securitization technology
you moved forward to, residential solar,
and now you're moving that same thing
forward to, CMBS
and ABS of the data center.
So, they're very similar.
The rating agencies are very familiar
with these things.
You have to
look at a few different variables
and understand them slightly differently,
but particularly energy
infrastructure and, and telecom
infrastructure, those are two things
that we've been doing for decades.
I'll walk us through the differences
then between, say, you know, a cell tower,
ABS or, I don't know, a solar power
ABS versus a data center, ABS or CMBS.
Sure.
So a cell tower, ABS, really, when you're
looking at that, you just have the tower.
It's on land.
You may have somebody that's coming along
in order to mow the lawn around it,
but they don't have much in terms
of the actual equipment
that's on top of the the cell tower.
When you have a residential solar
securitization,
you put the solar panel
on top of somebody's roof,
you're contracting the cash flows off
of that again on the,
the cell tower you're contracting.
The cash flows off of that.
You pull those together,
and then you put a bond on top of it
with a data center, security station.
You have the cash flow from the,
data center lease.
You have the cash flow from other aspects
of the business that may be going along
with that, like, related to the power
and some of the additional services,
you pull those, you have long term
contracts and cash flows,
and then a rating agency
can write those as well.
But at the end of the day,
you're trying to make sure that you have
a special purpose vehicle
that has all the assets that it needs.
Was then it, you have an, separate entity
that's handling
the billing and the collection, an entity
that's handling
the operation
and maintenance, of the asset.
And that's supposed to be a standalone
product that can move, you know,
at least the 5 to 7 years until you get to
the anticipated payment date.
And often it's about a 30 year
weighted final maturity.
So I have a question and it's come up
a couple times on previous podcast,
but you mentioned, you know,
having a special purpose vehicle for this.
Sure.
Why does it seem that
so many big tech companies who are in the
AI space, who are presumably very,
very cash rich and profitable,
why are so many of them
financing off balance sheet.
And better things to do with their money?
So the the return on their invested
capital
is much better on the tech side
than it is on the infrastructure side.
Infrastructure is,
usually low margins.
But the, the benefit with that
is it's long term reliable,
understood assets such as, again,
if you're doing a large energy project
or even the powered shell itself,
it's land, it's
a building, it's got the fiber connection,
it's got the power connection.
And that's something that can continue
over a long period of time.
Whereas on the tech side,
they make a lot more money and have much
greater margins as we all know.
Right.
So they just want this
aspect of the business,
which is could be very profitable,
but it's stable, it's very predictable.
It's like, let's outsource
this, let's have some other entity.
How is that risk?
What are the risks of,
in data center finance?
When you think about the other side, not
the tech companies, but the lenders to,
the SPV and we'll
talk about the different structures
that that credit form can take.
What are the risks?
You know, it's a fairly stable long
term thing, but how could things go wrong?
So it it depends on what exactly
you're financing.
Right.
So in a securitization,
and and and and abs, what you're doing is
you are financing the business of this
powered shell or turnkey solution.
The tenant quality is very important.
Do I have somebody that can actually
that has the, investment
grade tenant quality or a diversified pool
of high credit quality tenants who can.
Actually be clear, you're securitizing
the cash flows from the data center
leases, right? Yeah. So exactly.
So on an ABS, it's it's a focus
on the business of this data center.
The the actual lease,
is in the securitization
and then the hard assets are in there
as well.
And a CMBS, you have the lease as well,
but it's more focused on the mortgage.
And then we have credit
tenant leases as well,
which are kind of directly to the tenant.
That's useful. Thank you.
So risks associated with securitization
are usually focus on the tenant quality.
Yeah.
They're focus on the term of the lease.
How long is the lease
if you have a 10 or 15 year lease,
if you have a shorter term lease,
you're going to look a little bit more at,
well, is this something
that's going to need to be released?
And that time frame,
what is the rate on the lease?
If it's a below market lease, it's
much less likely that somebody is going
to want to get a new lease and leave you.
And then,
the facility itself, is the facility
going to be able to withstand,
kind of technology
risk over a long period of time?
So how are people structuring the deals
at the moment to compensate for that risk?
So you have the time mismatch.
You have maybe tenancy rollover
risk as well.
Are people like adding
extra credit protection or how are they,
you know
making these palatable to investors.
So one is the loan to value
your your advance rate.
So typically if you're
looking for something that's an investment
grade securitization,
you're going to have it around 40 to 50%.
Your the structure of the
bond itself
will have, rated final maturity
that's much further out than lease,
maybe 25, 30 years.
But you're anticipating
that the full, principal of the lease
would be able to be repaid within 5
to 7 years, except that, excuse me.
The the the full principal
amount of the bond would be able
to be repaid within 5 to 7 years,
but the lease itself is a ten year lease
or a 15 year lease,
and then that can get rehabbed
for another ten years on top of that.
So when you're looking at your
your cash flows,
the cash flows are going to support
your RDA prior to even worrying, do
the anticipated repayment date gone
prior to even worrying about your release.
So one of the things that sort of
like people tweet about
and people even write about,
including us and we've talked about
even this whole thing about GPU life
and some of these questions regarding
the long term value of the assets.
And people like,
you know, like to claim, oh, they're not
is it going to be as valuable
long term
as people think? I can't imagine,
does this come
up in your work and like,
what is what's really going on here?
Sure. So
it depends on what the financing structure
is that you're using.
So the, the GPU life itself
is more a question
on a private credit story or an equity.
Okay.
On the securitization side, they're more
focus on the turnkey data center itself.
All right.
The useful life,
comes up a lot
when you're doing the accounting.
And that rolls through to the earnings
per share of these public companies.
You've got a useful life of,
I think, a few years ago,
it was three years for these GPUs.
Now, some of them are using six years
if you're doing straight line amortization
over three years, taking about a third off
over six years, it's
obviously less than that.
And so you have much less amortization,
depreciation expense on it.
And that helps your earnings per share.
What's your impression of how,
private credit lenders
have been handling
the GPU age aging problem so far?
Like are they conscious of it
or are people still kind of basing
a lot of their expected cash flows off of,
GPUs that last, you know, longer
because they were previously being used
in cloud computing or something like that.
Yeah. So so they're very aware of it.
Particularly because if you look at the,
the new, you know,
Nvidia had the H one hundreds
in the two hundreds that had come out.
Then it was the Blackwell,
the B one hundreds, two hundreds.
And now Ruben's
going to come after that right.
So every 2 to 3 years you have these,
new chipsets.
And, and that it's almost like,
do I want to be, financing these laptops
that you've got in front of me
for six years or seven years?
What's the the replacement cycle on that?
So when do I need to get repaid on
my debt?
The, the interesting part that comes into
it is it's not just one laptop.
We're talking about entire data centers
full of these things.
And that's in the tens,
hundreds of millions of dollars.
So how are you actually going
to get your cash flow back
when maybe those aren't going to be used
for training the same way?
The reality,
though, is the useful life of these.
And the economic life
is not just that initial usage.
You can use it for other things. So,
starting out with
training, needing to get training done
as quickly as possible,
if the data center is well located
in Virginia or another tier one location,
maybe there's inference if it's close
to, a city or on our location.
And then for the CPUs, data centers
that have those, you can use them
for compute and analytics
and other technologies
and use cases that maybe that wasn't
what you originally wrote,
but you knew that
that was coming down the line.
Can you talk since you mentioned,
Virginia, can you talk about where we are
in 2025 with data center
siting and picking locations?
So I know that there's tons around
Northern Virginia,
and I know that there are
some huge projects
in the middle of nowhere in Texas
where, you know,
they're not going to offend any neighbors
or whatever, etc.
but what are the big themes that companies
are thinking about right now
when they think about location? Yeah.
So one of the great things about Virginia
is connectivity to the subsea cables.
So getting to Europe, getting to Africa,
getting to other locations
and the rest of the United States,
there's, a great regulatory environment
there in terms of power, in terms of,
actually building out there, the,
the infrastructure there
and, and other data
centers so that you can have,
I hate to use the word co-locate, but,
connectivity within other data centers
makes it makes it very attractive.
The problem is it's saturated.
It's a very saturated market.
And so if you want to build that next
large
giant data center
and you need power or you need water
or you need other parts
of the infrastructure, you're often
and you need to do it quickly,
you're often going to look elsewhere.
That's one of the reasons that Texas
and Ercot have become so attractive.
Yeah.
So one of the things we hear constantly
is that, you know, chips
and financing are not necessarily
the big choke points for doing this.
It's more the power.
And I guess I'm curious,
is it really a power shortage problem
or is it more the distribution of power
is not in the places where
these data centers, you know, want to be
because of convenience, like co-location?
It's it's you can say both as well.
Yeah.
It definitely is both.
I will say though, that with power
it's interconnection.
It's getting that actual permission
both for the load.
So the data center itself is drawing power
from the grid and for the generation.
And those are two separate
interconnections
on these larger facilities
that you're going to be getting at at
relatively the same time.
And if you can't have both, then you're
probably not going to be able to support
such a large facility.
So on the generation side,
if you're trying to get interconnection,
you go through a long process,
potentially with Ferc,
and with your ISO or RTL.
You know, Ercot, if you're in Texas,
to do typically at this scale,
like the large data center scale,
like a five year process
in order to get that generation
approved and interconnected.
And it's that's
just the approval five years.
And then you have to actually do
the connection. Yeah.
And then you got to build it. Wow.
The the fun part about that
is that that timeline,
a lot of people walk in and they think,
oh, I've heard that it's going to be 18
to 36 months
in order for me to get this done.
And then a month or two goes by
and they get a new date
and it's been pushed out,
and then a few months go by
and they get a new date
and it's been pushed out.
And one of the analogies we use is like,
you're waiting, in the airport
to get on the plane.
And, you know, they they call
I fly United all the time.
They're like,
oh, it's global services, okay.
Global services go forward.
And now, armed services, okay.
Armed services and people
with young children and you just
you realize that that first class ticket
that has,
you know, boarding group one doesn't mean
that you're getting on first.
Well, you all get there at the same time.
At least this is how I because, you know,
I don't like waiting there either.
But I was like, you know what I'm getting?
I'm going to arrive at the destination
the same as all these people with children
and everything.
So it's hot.
Anyway, you know,
there was a story recently.
We have one of the big new cloud
companies, sort of lowered
a growth forecast
because of, delay in the third party
data center project, which is exactly
sort of what you're talking about.
How does that affect the financing,
this uncertainty of
when you can actually plug these things in
or when they're going to get approved?
Because that sounds very frustrating.
And time is money.
And so how does that interact
with the credit component.
Yeah.
So so you kind of have three categories
in the timeline of one of these projects.
You have your development capital
that's often equity funded.
You have your construction capital.
So you get a big construction loan once
you've got your permits and your power,
and then after that's been completed, then
you do your take out financing that
maybe the securitization and the like.
Has the
environment, has the, regulatory
and I guess political environment.
Does it feel like a significantly changed
in the last six months?
So you talk about like, you know,
very few people were talking about water.
My impression is that the water component
specifically is very overrated
based on things. Right.
But it obviously is a matter.
But, you know, the public
is really concerned about water.
The public is clearly concerned
about electricity prices.
People are showing up to town halls
to protest or to voice their opposition
to new data center projects in the
neighbor, in the areas where they live.
Does it feel like the environment today,
when we're talking in December 2025,
is meaningfully different
than it was at the start of the year
in terms of public awareness
of all this stuff.
So, so politically. Absolutely right.
I think that the community organizers
and there are a lot of organizations
that kind of make their money based
on outrage around these types of things.
They've realized
that this is a great opportunity for them.
And if you look at the sustainability
reports of a lot of the hyperscalers,
and others,
they talk about being water positive,
it doesn't mean that
they're just happy about water.
It means that they're actually trying to
have a positive impact, and they'll start,
putting money into the watersheds
and the like, and water replacement.
And that actually is really meaningful.
And as a part of the story that I think
a lot of the folks that are thinking
about the political aspect
of this don't realize,
which is when these data centers come in
and the balance sheets
of these hyperscalers come into an area
that's largely been overlooked.
You know, it's that New Yorker,
magazine cover
where, you know, you're looking from,
you know.
The New York River or.
Yeah, Manhattan.
And then it's California. Right? Exactly.
A lot of these areas are are,
are underinvested,
particularly in infrastructure.
And a hyperscaler comes in and start
saying, well, you know, this water
treatment facility is insufficient.
We need to build it out.
That's very meaningful.
Part of that interconnection study
that we're doing.
You're looking
at the electric transmission of the area
that is very meaningful.
But water for the developer, it's
not a problem unless it's actually
a problem.
What I mean by that is, you know, well,
we have a lawyer on,
several lawyers on staff
that focus on water.
And one of them, for example,
knows all 98 water districts in Texas
and knows
which one you're supposed to go to
if you want to get your project done
quickly and which one to avoid.
That's something that if you mess
it up, could really affect your timeline.
We now, I'm really curious
what would make one
water destination more attractive versus
the one you want to avoid.
Is it just regulatory hurdles,
or is it like quality of the water.
So it's not quality of the water.
You know, if it's potable water, it's
potable water.
Yeah.
It's both water supply
and then water offtake.
So one of the issues in oil
and gas in Texas that they've had is
what are we where do we get all the water,
and what do we do with all of this
wastewater?
It's the exact same thing
with data centers.
Obviously they're putting different
chemicals into the water
in order to put it into the facility,
but it's still a chemically treated water
that has to be processed before
it can go back, either into the drinking
supply or into,
you know, the rivers and streams.
And so just back to the,
the political environment, like,
what's that doing on the ground
today, this big change that's occurred
because everyone's up in arms
about all this stuff.
How is that affecting some of the project
planning that exists today?
So I think that the developers
have been very mindful in the past,
but they're even more so
now because of the sensitivity around it.
They're in certain states.
They will be more,
they're considering
proposals that might involve moratoriums
on data centers.
Yeah.
That's not the case in Texas.
If you look at, what Governor Abbott
and and the legislature have been doing,
they're pushing a more data centers,
more tax incentives, more infrastructure.
I think Virginia and several other places
realize how important it is
to their economies as well,
and to their tax base.
Because data centers produce
a lot of tax revenue
for these states, which go to help
fund schools and the like.
Is anyone talking about public private
partnerships in the data center context?
I feel like this
is something that like comes in waves.
People start getting really,
really excited about, like public private
partnerships for infrastructure build out,
and then you don't hear about it
for like five years
and then it comes back.
Are we in one of those waves right now
when it comes to data center
spend or not really. Yeah. So so
I'm thinking about what I can say.
So the short answer is yes.
Those are being explored.
They're both from the perspective
of a public private partnerships,
but also from the perspective of
like the Department of Energy,
Law and Program office. And.
All right, you worked on so many others.
Yeah.
So they can provide, financing support.
And, and the Department of Energy
has been,
you know, very vocal about what
the loan program office offers.
The Department
of Defense, Department of War,
I guess now, also has programs
that they can make available.
Some of these are actual grants.
Some of them are loans, but separate.
And apart from that,
there's loan guarantees.
And so you have a backstop
by the federal government of a loan
that let's be honest, if you're at 40%
loan to value and you've got, investment
grade tenant
that's going to be paying the lease
longer than the term of the,
of the bond, do you really need it?
Probably not, but it can help lower
the cost of capital anyway, actually.
See more about that, because we did
several episodes and we've done
several episodes about the idea of loan
guarantees and particularly
the loan programs office as well.
But from the private side, like talk to us
about how that functionally turns into,
okay, we're going to get a better credit
rating or this is going to enable private.
This is going to crowd in private capital
as they like to say, what happens,
what is the steps via
which the government's role,
suddenly unlocks this financing?
So I, I think in all credit
when you, when you're trying to underwrite
any kind of loan,
you want to see what are the cash flows
or what's the collateral,
and am I going to get paid back.
What's the likelihood. Right.
And one of the things that the,
the frameworks I think of are showing you
who you walk with.
And I'll show you who you are. Right.
Okay, fine.
If you have the United States government
that is providing a backstop,
then I can be confident
I'm going to get paid back.
If it's Microsoft or Google or another
who's
providing a guarantee on a project loan,
then I'm very comfortable
that I'm going to get paid back.
When you
put these types of things together,
that means I don't have to charge you
an extra incremental amount
to protect me from that credit risk.
And that extra money
that you keep in your pocket.
You can
then turn into additional projects.
And it's a velocity of money concept.
I want to go back to private credit
for a second because, you know,
as you mentioned earlier,
a lot of these deals have been done
in the private credit space
so far, and companies
have a lot of options
when it comes to financing.
As I mentioned in the intro,
they can go the public route,
they can securitize,
they can go to private credit.
And whenever people talk about
private credit in the context of AI,
they always say vague things like,
oh, it provides customizable
financing options and stuff like that.
What exactly is the attraction
of private credit for data centers?
And I built out.
So one of the most attractive
things that private credit can
but doesn't always offer is non dilutive
capital right.
Equity is dilutive.
And equity is very expensive.
There's that risk premium
that's associated with it.
Private credit.
There is an assumption in the story
that because of the extra protections
that they receive, they don't need
the same, equity risk premium.
So a lot of them are looking
at maybe a 15% IRR,
or they might charge
you 10 to 12% upfront.
But then because of that like that,
you basically their minimum return
on the capital that they'll get paid or
an IRR premium over time and the take out,
then they'll have to catch up on the back
end that the equity
they're taking, a percentage of what you,
at the end of the day are going to get.
And it's usually a much more expensive
piece, private credit.
But what about private credit versus
other forms of credit like bank lending
or the public bond market. Or well,
can you get. It?
Well,
I mean, that's a I mean, what is that?
A I don't know, I.
Mean, underwriting standards
for private credit can be, riskier
than what you would have from,
you know, a back at banks, credit desk.
This is another thing I'm wondering.
So when it comes to tenant diversification
in data centers,
how is that
judged and evaluated and priced?
Because if I think about who's in a,
you know, using a data center,
a correlation is hard to measure
at at the best of times.
And if I think about, you know,
like a new business that's growing
and everyone is suddenly using it,
it feels like the kind of thing
that could end up being very correlated
as opposed to diversified.
So when you are thinking about larger
investment
grade bonds and D&D and data centers,
normally you are thinking about wholesale
data centers where there's one tenant
that's that has that facility,
and that tenant has investment grade
credit quality.
Right.
It it's much less likely that you are
going to have a pool of non-investment
grade, tenants in a kind of co-location
style data center.
And then because of that, Fitch or S&P
or Kroll is going to give you
this investment grade rating.
So I, I don't think that the expectation,
should be.
That you're going
to get a investment grade
rating on a pool of Non-investment
grade tenants, at least not right now.
I think that eventually when you've got
thousands of tenants across,
you know, hundreds of data centers,
that becomes much more attractive.
It's just not really
where the market is right now.
We did an episode,
a few months ago in September, actually,
where we were talking to, this guy
Don Wilson in Chicago who is setting up
a tree of futures trading firm for GPA's.
And theoretically, you can hedge your GPU
cost as you think about the industry
going forward.
And he, could you see that
being a useful, instrument
for data center
financing I'm a little concerned about,
is the value of this collateral going
the same?
I want to hedge, the GPU exposure.
Could you see over time it maturing
and that being a valuable thing. I,
I love new finance tools.
I think that that kind of creative
creativity is really important.
There's always an opportunity there
that the thing
I have noticed with the data centers,
just with other asset classes,
is that there's always a cash flow stream
that is not being utilized.
And so, for example, if you have a
securitization, you're or really any bond,
you're not necessarily
going to get credit for everything in it.
So your contracted cash flows,
if that counterparty is an investment
grade, may not get, an advance
rate, a loan to value on that
somebody else should be there in order
to take advantage of that and provide you
with additional capital that you can
then reinvest into development.
So last week
we had a big outage, at the CME
and futures were basically frozen
for like ten hours or something.
And this was because of an issue
at one of the CME data centers,
which is operated by a company called
Cirrus one.
Is there a reputational
or operational risk,
that either deal structures
or investors need to be aware of
when it comes to these financing
arrangements.
Reputational or in what regards?
Well,
for instance, of one has a big meltdown
at one of their data centers,
which seems to have happened
because one of their cooling centers
reportedly malfunctioned.
Is that something that then gets priced
into the financing arrangement,
or is that something that investors
should be concerned about?
So these are these are definitely things
that investors underwrite to.
So, if you are a,
blue chip operator and developer,
you are going to have
a lower cost of capital than you would
otherwise.
There are a lot of Johnny come lately and
to data centers over the last two years,
since
AI has, really come to the forefront,
the people that have been doing it
for a decade,
they know what they're doing,
and they're very good at it.
And that doesn't mean
that there aren't going to be problems.
Yeah.
You know, things blow up sometimes.
Squirrels chew wires. Yeah.
Hopefully not subsea ones like.
There are accidents all the time.
But that's part of why
you have these pretty incredible
engineering studies that are done in order
to actually put these things together.
And, and freak accidents happen.
And, you know,
that's part of the credit risk.
We just compared
to other sort of real estate plays.
Is there more sort of,
I guess, operational
risk in a data center than in other,
you know,
we're just some sort of retail,
packaging, retail distribution facility.
I imagine the sort of operational risk
isn't going to be as great
in something like that.
Yeah, that so that's part of why
they have these service level agreements
within the data centers yourselves,
where the operator is agreeing to provide,
an uninterruptible,
non intermittent power.
That's one of the big things
that people focus on.
And how do the terms of that contract work
and what are the backstops
you could have, a reserve account
associated with it
so that if there are payments
that are necessary to be made,
that there's just cash sitting there.
Ready to go.
Normally people are thinking that
that would reduce the,
the cash flow on the bond.
And, and that would reduce
at the end of the day, the equity
distribution coming from the SPV
as opposed to affecting the,
you know, the payment on the bond.
That reminds me, actually,
are you seeing a big,
surge in demand for,
like, data center insurance
or for people,
you know, who want to insure,
not just against operational risk,
but cyber risk and things like that.
Yes. So that one of the wonderful things
about any kind of economic activity
is that the insurance
market is always there to support it.
Well, like the lawyers as. Well, right?
Yeah, definitely. Give us a call. Right.
The the reality though is
the you know,
there are products
that data centers have had for decades,
and then there are new risks
that are coming up
just because of how AI training works.
You can always go to Lloyd's of London
in order to get a specific policy
if necessary. But for the most part,
these
are risks that have already been priced in
and there are products
that are already there.
Now, you know,
there's talk of, well,
there are products that exist in terms of,
getting an insurance product
to handle your technology risk.
So does the does the product work
at the end of the day?
Or does it become obsolete too quickly?
That looks more like a, that almost
as opposed to a real insurance policy.
But it's something
that can be underwritten.
How valuable is just having a, a plug
in to the grid, you know, thinking about
or those various deals
of, companies wanting to buy Bitcoin
mining operations, for example.
And it seems like, you know what?
Yeah, maybe you can make a little money
mining Bitcoin, but you have
you have access to 24 seven
reliable power.
That's a lot more valuable than what's
going on inside the shell here.
Talk to us just about that value of anyone
who has access to power.
So so powered land is huge.
And that is developing.
You know, it's existed for a while,
but is becoming more and more important,
because there are rights
and real estate developers who don't need
to have the sophistication of
can I do the new direct
to cooling, technology
for a powered shell or turnkey solution?
I'm just going to have land,
and I'm going to make sure
that there's sufficient power here,
for you to build your data center
or for you to bring, your GPUs into.
That's attractive.
If you listen to the earnings calls
of several of the real estate developers,
they're moving into that.
If they haven't already. So there.
So their job is
they're just going to secure land
that they can know,
that they know they can get power to.
So they've already got like
they've got the right to.
So the the interesting part is
there are so many different projects,
over the last several decades
where, they've been working
through interconnection studies
for the land for you name it project,
and they're waiting years and years
just like everybody else
in order to get those done.
Well, why use it for this
when we can use it for that?
And data centers,
you can make a lot more money on it.
Isn't the obvious solution
to the power problem just for, you know,
the the big guys
to build their own power system
and maybe spend a little bit more money
plugging it into the grid.
Again,
if political pushback is becoming an issue
or if regulators are worried about this,
shouldn't they just do it on their own?
Is that the straightforward thing to do?
The hyperscalers themselves?
I think that goes back to what are
what's the best use of their capital.
They're they're not in the infrastructure
business, specifically the, the
I will say, if you look at a lot of Amazon
as an example,
they sold books, they had the website,
they they needed to expand.
So they build Amazon Web Services.
They need a distribution.
They've got that.
Tech companies
have been becoming energy companies
for years.
Energy companies
we know had to become tech companies
a decade ago in order to just keep up.
But now there's this integration
that's happening
from both sides, both in terms
of what's happening in our operations.
But the ownership itself.
Just going back to, powered land.
For a second.
So what you're saying is
that there are these developments
that have been going on a long time,
but they were initially planned
for something else.
But then today in 2025 is they're getting
closer to when they could be connected.
Maybe, I as a
you know what that could this
this connection is a lot more valuable,
for an AI data center.
Absolutely. So this is interesting.
This to me, like,
the only reason I go back to this
is because one of the things
that when people talk about an AI bubble,
if there is one, is this idea of crowding
out other productive uses of the economy.
Right.
Are there better things in the long term
that we could have done
with these turbines?
Are these other better things
that we could have done with these,
electrical connection
systems, etc.,
and other, companies might have been
waiting on some piece of gear
and the AI data center outbid them.
And I'm not gonna
I'm not asking you like it's sustainable,
but there are other things.
They're going to lose out
or not have access to electricity
that people wanted to do
but aren't going to because that wire
is more valuable for an AI company.
I 100% think about,
the actual interconnection cube
to two and a half years ago,
before I became a big deal, there was,
I want to say, 20 600GW,
in the interconnection queue.
And we were expecting 80% of
that would never actually be constructed.
Only 20% of it would.
And that's pretty typical.
Even on a going forward basis.
What are you going to do
with those projects and with those,
that land that has already started
in the process of interconnection
studies and the like?
Well, you can shift that to,
data centers,
especially because a lot of that
you are producing solar
or batteries, wind and other power gen.
Now you add on the data center
layer to it.
And what may not have been economic before
now is.
Should I build a data center job?
Yeah, I've got a grid connection.
I've got water and yeah, there we go.
Okay. Next project, all lots.
Builds a data center
in protected land in Connecticut.
Probably not. Actually.
So this sort of, piggybacks on a question
that Tracy asked already, but
why not just for, you know, is
these is companies, particularly
the hyperscalers
that look out in the environment
and there's all these people
showing up at meetings complaining
about the water, etc., like that.
Why isn't the future just entirely behind
the meter in Texas, where it's like,
we're just going to build it all.
We're going to have the natural
gas plant onsite.
We're never going to bother with the grid.
We're never going to we're
just going to have the plant right there.
Why is it there?
Just the entire future of data centers.
So there one of the issues with behind
the meter is
what if the data center goes away?
So for example,
what if Mark Zuckerberg one day decides
I'm not doing the metaverse anymore
and somebody in AI says, I'm not doing AI,
or we move from GPUs
to quantum computing
or something like that.
You want to have that generative capacity
interconnected with the grid
so that you don't have a stranded asset.
Looking forward.
And I mentioned earlier, core,
we've saying, okay, there is a delay
and some of it's build out
what are the big choke points
and you expect them to stack up.
We recently did an episode, with Travis
Kabila and RG, and he was like,
I don't know,
like the amount of just the sheer amount
that we're adding to the grid,
like it's going to be tough
and I don't know how it's all going
to, pan out, for some of these projects,
but what do you see
as the sort of big bottlenecks
or choke points that you're thinking about
in the coming years?
So power continues to be the number one
bottleneck?
I don't think anybody would dispute that.
Water obviously is an issue as well.
Getting the turbines and getting what
you actually need in order to produce,
power is very difficult.
I, I do think, though, that
when you look at how some of these,
interconnection requests are prepared,
you have 5
or 10 different people making applications
for the exact same project.
So it inflates
what the expectations are on the number
of projects in the market at a given time.
When you get rid of all of that
extra wash, you,
you wind up with hyperscalers,
large enterprises, and other
real investment grade, or serious tenants
give you projects that can get done.
That's infrastructure,
that's infrastructure. Great.
And a lot of the speculative assets,
that those are power points.
They they probably are not going to get
made, particularly
if there's any kind of economic
shock later.
Travis Wofford,
thank you so much for coming on Odd Lots
That was great.
Thank you.
Thank you so. Much, Tracy
I thought that was really helpful.
Really clarified a lot of things for me.
I'm trying to think like the point about,
the sequencing of the financing
I thought was really interesting
or very important
to help me understand these things,
because in my mind and, like, wow,
they're gonna, like, lose so much money.
They're breaking ground on all these
deals. Yeah.
What if they don't actually get
implemented because you're waiting forever
and you're hearing him
describe the sequencing of different
financing at different stages, like.
All right, well, at least
that makes sense to me.
Yes. I still feel like there's kind
of a mismatch issue here.
Well, it just feels like, you know,
you're talking about a technology
that has like its own upgrade
risk, let's say, like, you know,
people are developing
new chips pretty fast
and you don't know when the next one
is coming down the line
and when you might want to replace
all your chips with something else.
So that's one thing. Yeah.
Tendency roll rollover.
Yeah, I know he pushed back a little bit
on the diversified point,
but you know, again, my understanding
is for a lot of the ABS structures
maybe CMBS as well.
Diversification is part of the proposal.
And I think he mentioned it earlier.
And that seems difficult to me
to accurately measure.
If you have a bunch of tenants, all,
you know, doing something in the cloud,
drawing something from a data center,
if there's a big macroeconomic downturn
or something like who's to say
that they're not all going
to renege on their lease at once?
The levels of uncertainty
just seem so extreme
because you're talking about,
okay, there's the economic downturn.
There's the fact that maybe a lot of this
AI stuff could completely fizzle out
and doesn't produce or, return
even in normal times.
Then there's the technological questions.
Then there's
the operational questions about,
are you actually good at operating
and building a data center?
Not everyone is going to be the same.
And then there's the grid interconnection
and all of these things
about like reliability of power, etc..
So it feels like, yes, on the one hand,
I very much buy that on paper. Yes.
Do you know this is the 2025 iteration
of what used to be cell towers
or what used to be, rooftop solar
or anything else, but with just an
I mean, you mentioned with the cell tower,
for example, if one guy whose job is
to mow the lawn, right, and
that's like, that's just.
Going round and round, there's.
Mean like operational component.
I get the, you know, most of the time
the tower is just there.
Right.
And you have to make sure
that it's in a safe area, etc..
But the, the degree of complexity,
of operational complexity,
of technological energy complexity for the
it just seems like exponentially higher.
Yeah.
And I keep thinking back to just the sheer
scale of it.
And like,
the numbers like got thrown around
literally trillions of dollars
in the next few years.
Well,
I'm sure we'll do more episodes on it.
There's so many, there's so many,
so many sub episodes we could do,
including how the best of the Texas is 98
water districts and how you fund which.
No, no, no, Joe, you know what sub episode
we could do, what subsea cables.
We got to do.
We didn't get into that, but we should do
that.
Was a prime. Time.
That was a time. Yeah, well,
we should do more subsea cable.
Yeah, we.
Should also and actually just to,
in terms of
data center siting, like access to,
you know, latency risk
and where it needs to be, etc.
is something we should talk about more.
Should we leave it there for now?
Let's leave it there.
All right.
