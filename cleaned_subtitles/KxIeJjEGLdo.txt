I'm going to talk to you today about one of the 
two great generations in modern Japanese history. 
They are the Meiji generation, 
named after the Meiji Emperor here. 
That generation transformed Japan into the first 
and only non-Western modern power in that period. 
The second great generation of 
the modern Japanese is of course  
the post-war generation that transformed 
their country into a global powerhouse. 
I'm going to ask a question, 
or try to both ask and answer. 
What caused the reversal of the balance 
of power in Asia in the period that I'm  
going to talk to you about?
It's a really consequential  
question about why these tectonic changes 
take place in the international system. 
Historically China had always been the dominant 
civilization in Asia from time immemorial. 
Then upstart Japan winds up doing 
things, or China winds up doing things,  
and it reverses and has profound effects.
It's a very relevant question in our own  
day when there's an ongoing reversal of the 
reversal, when China's on the comeback and  
threatening to put Japan back in its box.
So it's really interesting to ask why? How  
do these things happen? So that's the 
background of what I'm talking about. 
But if you think about China back in the 
day before Japan trounced China in the  
First Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese believed that 
there was only one civilization, theirs naturally. 
They believed that of course it's the best.
Because there's only one that makes it  
easier to be the best.
But in addition, if you  
think about all levels of human endeavor, Chinese 
institutions were imitated throughout the East. 
It was the richest country on 
the planet for many, many years. 
Incredible achievements in 
science, philosophy, you name it. 
Also there was another assumption that people 
didn't make a U-turn on the path to civilization. 
It's always forward towards Chinese civilization.
Well, Japan by Westernizing is taking a U-turn  
on the road to civilization. It's 
dumping Chinese civilization. Already  
we have at least two civilizations out there.
Then when it trounces China in a war, it suggests  
to the Chinese that they can't be better than 
the Japanese, at the military things at least. 
This effect on China was far more 
devastating than the Opium Wars. 
The Chinese could write those off, the 
losses there to "a bunch of crazy Europeans,  
they're irrelevant to us."
But when Japan did this,  
it basically detonated the Confucian 
underpinnings of Chinese civilization. 
The Chinese have been trying to find 
a suitable replacement ever since. 
For a while they thought it was communism. Maybe 
they still do. So I'm going to ask a question,  
why did the Asian balance of power change?
Now, spoiler alert, I'll give the answer. 
I'm going to say, clever decisions in Tokyo.
But I'm going to use a particular framework to  
answer this that I have found really useful.
I learned it from teaching at the Naval War  
College where students are required 
to have a counterargument in papers. 
This is what I learned from doing this.
So I'm going to have an argument,  
which is a thesis, and then I'll 
have some data supporting it. 
But I'm not going to quit there.
I'm going to find the second  
best argument, the counterargument.
The absolutely best alternate explanation,  
but not one that I think is the best one.
I'm going to give you the best one. 
That's my thesis and I'm going to go into that.
It's incredibly valuable, particularly in our  
own fraught political times where 
we need to hear each other out. 
You need to hear out the counterargument 
of what the other side is saying. 
What you'll often find out in a 
counterargument is that there are  
actually some very valid points in it.
It leads you to think, "Oh well, maybe  
I need to adjust my own argument."
So changing your mind's a good  
idea if the data comes in.
Also, it gets you away from  
monocausal explanations where you come up with 
one cause you think "that's it, time to quit." 
If you're thinking about the counterargument, 
you might get other causes as well. 
Also, if you're going to do something like on a 
job and you have to recommend a course of action,  
your thesis, you had better anticipate 
what the counterargument's going to be. 
Then the third part of this is the rebuttal.
Because you had better come into that  
meeting with your boss with the rebuttal 
in your back pocket so that you can deal  
with people who are saying you're wrong.
The rebuttal cannot be a repetition of  
the original argument because you know what? 
That's annoying. Don't do that. It’s really  
annoying. The most effective ones are coming at 
the problem from a completely different direction  
from either argument or counterargument 
that then shores up your argument. 
My other direction is, I've got 
a Sino-Japanese problem and I'm  
going to come around with a Russia angle.
So this is my game plan of what I'm planning  
to do and the analytical reasons for doing it.
Okay, so I have a thesis which I'm going to  
give to you in emails and written 
work and lectures like this one. 
You really help people if you explain exactly what 
you're up to and you do it succinctly at the very  
beginning. So here it is. The Japanese 
leaders Westernized their institutions. 
They integrated multiple instruments of 
national power into a coherent strategy. 
Then in the Russo-Japanese War, they 
quit that one exactly at the culminating  
point of victory for maximum gains.
Together, these three things overturned  
the balance of power in their favor. That's my 
thesis. Short, sweet, you've got it. Whether  
you agree with it or not, we will get there.
Okay, so now I'm going to go to the first point. 
You should start with a topic sentence. I'm 
going to start one. Why am I doing this?  
These are all sign posts to orient you 
to my argument so that you can absorb it. 
Also, if you don't like it, you can see 
very clearly the parts that you don't  
like and we can get into a fun conversation.
My topic sentence for the Westernization part  
is that Japanese leaders concluded that in 
order to parry the threat of the Industrial  
Revolution, and of all these imperial powers 
coming at them, they needed to Westernize their  
institutions in order to protect their national 
interests. That was step one. So that's my  
topic sentence. Okay, so what's going on? The 
Industrial Revolution started in England, or  
Britain more generally in the late 18th century.
It spread to the continent after the  
Napoleonic Wars died down at the 
beginning of the 19th century. 
By the mid-19th century, it had reached Asia.
It's profoundly disruptive to traditional  
societies whose traditional security paradigms no 
longer work when they're facing the weaponry of  
the industrialized age coming at them.
What the Industrial Revolution does  
and why it's so revolutionary is it 
produces compounded economic growth. 
Traditional societies are 
pretty much pretty stable. 
But when you compound economic growth, the 
difference in power and wealth becomes stark  
between those who do and those who don't.
It's also based, not only on technological  
changes—where you've got all these fancy armaments 
and railways and telegraphs—but it's also based on  
institutions. What are institutions? 
They're how we organize each other. 
When you think of institutions, you think 
of the buildings where people are. But  
that's not it. It's the people in there who 
are working on a shared project together,  
a shared area of activity.
This is one of the hallmarks  
of Western civilization.
This is what the Romans  
figured out about institutions and laws, that 
this is a way of really harnessing people,  
and it's profoundly powerful.
I'll go into all of that. 
Japan's looking at the world with 
this incoming industrial revolution,  
or the powers that have benefited from it.
It's watching its neighbor China being  
defeated twice in war. They're horrified, not 
just appalled. They’re looking at it and going,  
"maybe we’ll be next?" And they're right. The 
United States does unto Japan what Britain and  
France did unto China. What's that? The treaty 
port system. What it meant is that trade in  
Japan and China would take place in designated 
treaty ports, that the West would set tariffs on  
this trade, and that Western citizens in China or 
Japan in these treaty ports would not be subjected  
to Chinese or Japanese law, but home country law.
When Chinese and Japanese citizens were in Europe  
and the United States, they most certainly 
were not dealing with home country law,  
they were dealing with US or Western law.
So it was not reciprocal in any way. 
In addition, each one of these treaties had a 
most favored nation clause in it which said,  
the one who's negotiating this treaty, 
the most favored one, whatever they  
negotiate will be given to everybody else.
So it meant whatever one could negotiate  
accrued to them all.
It meant that China  
lost sovereignty and Japan lost their 
sovereignty when these treaties went in. 
So the Japanese, unlike China which fights war 
after war with these Westerners trying to defeat  
them militarily, and it's unsuccessful.
The Japanese say, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,  
whoa, we're going to assess what 
the nature of the problem is." 
They sent fact-finding mission after 
fact-finding mission to Europe primarily,  
but also the United States.
This is just the most famous one,  
the Iwakura Mission, which was off to the 
West in the United States as well in 1871. 
They're studying not only Western military 
institutions, but a whole array of political,  
economic, legal, social, educational - the works 
- to understand the basis for Western power and  
the problem that is hitting them.
They arrive in Europe at a really  
interesting time.
It's when Otto von  
Bismarck is just finishing up the third war 
of the unification of the Germanic states. 
The Japanese think, "Ooh, this might be quite a 
model for us." Why? Because Prussia transformed  
itself over a succession of three wars from 
the weakest of the five great European powers  
to second only to Great Britain.
It did so in part by unifying the  
Germanic states into modern Germany.
The Japanese are thinking, "Wow,  
this might be relevant to us because we're 
divided up into all these feudal domains  
that we have just tried to glue together.
What are the lessons to be learned here?" 
As they're thinking about this and watching 
what Bismarck is up to, they come upon  
thinking about institutions and technology.
I'm going to use the words in the following sense. 
Modernization means adopting the 
most state-of-the-art technology,  
whatever it is, not just military 
technology but all manner of technology. 
Westernization the way I'm going to use it 
means adopting Westernized institutions. 
I don't mean just military institutions.
I mean everything from whether you westernize  
your educational institutions 
or political whatever it is. 
The question is, can you 
have one without the other? 
Can you modernize and have all the 
fancy gadgets and things without  
having the Westernized institutions that 
the societies that created these things had? 
If you think about it, this 
dichotomy is still with us. 
There are a lot of fighters in the Middle East 
and North Africa who are more than happy to  
use state-of-the-art technology, but the last 
thing they want is Westernized institutions. 
The Japanese—when they posed this question 
back in the day asking whether you can have one  
without the other—they decided the answer was no.
They didn't particularly like Western culture,  
but they believed that in order to not only 
use and import state-of-the-art technology,  
but become an independent producer of it, you've 
got to do some degree of Westernization. So they  
get home. They set themselves a policy objective 
which is to protect Japanese national security and  
sovereignty in an age of accelerating imperialism.
They come up with a two-phase  
grand strategy to do this.
It's going to start with a domestic phase  
of Westernization, Westernizing your institutions.
When they're done with that, they're going to have  
a foreign policy phase which is going to be about 
starting an empire. Why do that? Because they look  
at all the powers of their day and think "What's 
a great power look like in those days? Well,  
it has an empire." So they go, "Well, we're 
going to have an empire, all right." This is  
the domestic phase. These are known as the 
Meiji reforms in honor of the emperor who  
reigned in this period. It's between 1869-1890. 
It's a whole generation. If you look at them,  
only two of them pertain to the military.
There's the draft and then creating  
the general staff.
Then if you look at the  
two that start it all, they start it at the top 
of the social pyramid with the feudal domains. 
Those are the power brokers of Japan.
They're getting rid of all those and  
then they go right to the bottom of 
the social pyramid, which is children. 
They decide that they need to have compulsory 
elementary education because they don't believe  
you can have a modern country, a strong 
country, without a literate population. 
But if you look at the rest of these 
things, you're getting a Bank of Japan,  
you're going to be having something 
running your currency and other things. 
You've got a cabinet, a higher education, 
you're going to have a professional civil  
service constitution, a parliament, you're 
going to have a court system that looks like  
a Western court system with laws that 
look an awful lot like Western laws. 
As a result of doing all of this, the Westerners 
had no excuse left for having a treaty port system  
because this mirrors what's going on in the West.
So Britain, which is the precedent setter  
in these things, the superpower of its 
day, it renegotiates its treaties with  
Japan on the basis of juridical equality.
The other powers follow suit and do it. 
This happened in Japan a half century before 
China got rid of its unequal treaties. 
The domestic phase is over the moment 
Japan signs that treaty with Britain. 
The foreign policy phase has to do with China.
Japan believes it needs an empire  
and its neighborhood is a mess.
China is imploding for various reasons,  
which I will get to, and Korea's even worse.
China, because it's having massive civil wars  
throughout China, can no longer fulfill 
its suzerain role to stabilize Korea. 
And the Korean royal house is busy 
mailing package bombs to each other. 
I kid you not, they're blowing each other up.
What Japan is terribly concerned about is  
that Russia might try to fill this power 
vacuum. Why would Japan think that? Well,  
it’s the Trans-Siberian Railway. Russia 
decides in 1891 that it's going to build  
a Trans-Siberian Railway to exactly what?
There is no Russian population out there. 
Japan understands exactly what it is.
It's a bid for an empire in Asia. 
Because once Russia completes this thing, 
it's going to overturn the Asian balance of  
power because Russia is going to be able 
to deploy troops where nobody else can. 
Therefore, treaty revision 
happens on the 16th of July, 1894. 
That's when it's signed on 
the dotted line with Britain. 
Nine days later, Japan fires the opening 
shots of the First Sino-Japanese War. 
The Japanese fight three 
wars of Russian containment. 
I'm going to talk about the two 
that went well for them today. 
The third one's a whole other topic.
The first one's the First Sino-Japanese War,  
when little Japan defeats the greatest land power 
of Asia, China. Incredible. The second one, which  
I'll get to a decade later, is the Russo-Japanese 
War when the Japanese defeat, sorry spoiler alert,  
Russia, the greatest land empire of Europe.
Amazing that they can do this. 
The third one does not go nearly as well.
That would be the Second Sino-Japanese  
War from 1931 to 1945.
That morphs into World War II. 
That ruins the Japanese, 
but it's a different topic. 
The First Sino Japanese War, to 
let you know what happened in it. 
It's comprised of two pairs of key battles.
There are other battles as well, but this  
is a good way to understand it.
The first battle is at Pyongyang. 
The Japanese defeat the Chinese army, 
which takes off and retreats all the  
way over the border river, which is 
the Yalu, back into Chinese territory. 
So Japan has actually achieved its 
war objective, which was to remove  
Korea from the Chinese sphere of influence.
Battle number one, they've already done it. 
The second battle occurs within the week, 
the same week in mid September 1894. 
It's the Battle of the Yalu, where the 
Japanese navy trounces the Chinese navy,  
which, believe it or not, in this day both 
countries had state-of-the-art navies. 
Japan trounces it and gets command of 
the sea after that. That's terribly  
important for Japan. For Japan to reach the 
theater here, it's got to cross the sea. 
If there's a hostile navy out and about, it can 
sink troop transport, supplies and other things. 
It's very important to get 
rid of the hostile navy. 
The reason it gets command of the sea 
is because the Chinese decide they're  
never going to engage with the Japanese 
navy ever again and they duck into port. 
The Japanese are going to 
solve that problem for them. 
There is a second pair of battles which 
are fought over the winter of 1894-95. 
China only has one naval refitting station 
where you can actually fix large ships.  
That's at Port Arthur. They will take 
it by land the same way they're going  
to take it in the Russo-Japanese War.
The Chinese fleet, what's left of it,  
flees to Weihaiwei to hang out in port.
Japan lands an army on the Shandong peninsula  
there and also it blockades with its navy.
Then the army turns the landward guns on the  
ships in port and they sink them all.
And that is the end of that war. 
Here's what Japan got out of this war.
What I've got is a very simple framework:  
domestic, regional, international.
This is a way to help you remember  
what I'm going to tell you.
Three-part frameworks are  
helpful for getting information to other people.
Domestically, victory in this war validated a very  
controversial Westernization program.
All those Meiji reforms which sound  
so great in retrospect, actually the 
Japanese population didn't like them. 
Who wants their kids being sent to elementary 
school if they were working on the farm before?  
Who wants this Westernized curriculum? 
Who likes westerners anyway? People are  
wearing all this Western clothing and stuff. 
It's crazy land. Why would anyone like that?  
Once Japan wins this war and trounces China, a 
lot of Japanese have second thoughts about this. 
They're quite proud of their achievements 
and it vastly increases the prestige of  
the military, particularly the army.
This is going to have bad follow-on  
effects for civil military relations because 
it's going to increase military power over  
civil power but it takes a while to play out.
Regionally, Japan's replacing China as the  
dominant power and Japan's getting the beginnings 
of its empires, Taiwan and the Pescadores. 
Internationally, Japan becomes a recognized 
great power. What's my proof? It would be the  
1902 Anglo-Japanese Alliance, which is Britain's 
only long-term alliance between the Napoleonic  
Wars and World War I, alliance with Japan.
However, this war gets the eye of Mordor  
turned onto them because Russia is 
going, "Whoa, rising power in Asia. 
Potential two-front war problem for us 
with Europe in the west and whatever  
the Japanese think they're doing.
That triggers a Russo-Japanese arms  
race and Russia, the eye of Mordor, turns from 
Europe to Asia. That's going to be problematic. 
So now my transition sentence, 
I've done part number one. 
Not only did Japan Westernize its institutions 
in order to overturn the balance of power,  
but it also mastered grand strategy and 
integrated multiple instruments of national power. 
Here we go on that one.
Marshall Yamagata, who was the writer of  
war plans for the very successful Sino-Japanese 
war, predicted another war within the decade. 
The Russo-Japanese war came right on time.
In the meantime, Japan prepared for war. 
It integrated such instruments of national power 
as diplomacy, intelligence, military, economics. 
I'm going to go through each in 
turn, starting with diplomacy. 
Here you have Sun Tzu, who's China's big guru, 
Art of War, who's talking about how it's really  
important to disrupt alliances.
In modern terminology, that  
would be isolating the adversary.
That might be a good thing to do. 
That's the purpose of the Anglo-Japanese 
alliance. How does that work? Its terms  
say that if more than one European 
power comes to Asia to fight Japan,  
that means Russia plus one European buddy, then 
Britain is going to weigh in on Japan's side. 
Britain is the number one power in Europe, so 
why would you ever want to help Russia out? 
It won't go well with you if 
Britain is on Japan's side. 
This alliance goes into effect from 
1902 to 1907. It's a five year event.  
It opens a window of opportunity for 
Japan to sort out its empire in Asia. 
But the Trans-Siberian Railway, when it gets 
completed, is going to threaten to close that  
window. Here's why. The Trans-Siberian Railway 
in those days, it's not north of the Amur,  
it's actually straight through Manchuria.
This Chinese Eastern Railway, it's Russia's bid  
for empire, trying to control Manchuria. It was 
unfinished. It hadn't been double tracked. That  
means you're always having to push trains off so 
other trains can pass them in the other direction. 
It's missing its Lake Baikal link. 
Don't think lake, think Switzerland.  
Lake Baikal is about the size of Switzerland.
The Boxer Rebellion—the Al Qaeda of their day  
and I'll get to them—had destroyed much of 
the track, really upsetting the Russians. 
As a result of all of this, at the beginning 
of the Russo-Japanese War which began in 1904,  
the carrying capacity of that railway was 
only 20,000-40,000 men per month to the front. 
By the end of the war, the last 
battle, it's 100,000 men per month. 
If those numbers had been available at the 
beginning of the war, Japan would have faced  
numerically superior Russians from start to 
finish and would have been in a world of hurt. 
So Japan has got a window of opportunity that 
it's worrying about sorting things out in. 
In addition, Japan engages in 
a really big military buildup. 
It gets a really big indemnity from the 
First Sino-Japanese War and it spends it. 
That spending was finished in around 1901, 
meaning it's about ready to go to war. 
At the time the war breaks out, Russian naval 
assets in Asia were about ¾ those of Japan,  
but Russia was scheduled to surpass 
Japan's naval assets by about 1905. 
Again, you could see this window 
of opportunity threatening to shut. 
So if you look at it, Japan's window 
of opportunity of getting its empire,  
if that's what it thinks it wants… You've 
got to have treaty vision in place. 
You've got to isolate Russians, 
make sure that there's going to be  
no other power interfering in these things.
You’ve got to have your rearmament program. 
But look, this window is very short.
It's going to close in 1905-ish. 
When you think of windows of opportunities, 
what they mean is whatever it is you plan to  
do has to be completed before it slams shut.
If you're on the wrong side of the window,  
which is what happens to Japan in the Second 
Sino-Japanese War, you are in a world of hurt. 
In addition, what it means is that actually 
time is on the side of your adversary. 
It is a sign of weakness, not strength.
But the Japanese are looking at the  
Russians who are procrastinating.
The Japanese are telling them,  
"Hey, we will trade recognition 
of your dominance of Manchuria if  
you'll recognize our dominance in Korea."
The Russians didn't want to do anything. 
They're procrastinating and 
trying to go beyond this window. 
The Japanese are thinking, "We’ve got 
to sort it out before that happens." 
Another element of national power are 
psyops, as the US military likes to  
call them, psychological operations.
The Japanese were engaged in a really  
wide array of them both at the front in 
Russia and across the Russian Empire. 
At the front, the Japanese were secreting 
in all kinds of postcards for their Russian  
recruits there, showing the great life of the 
POW and rather posh Japanese accommodations,  
as opposed to the really bad life of 
getting disabled or killed in the front. 
Meanwhile, I think there were only three 
European countries, including Russia,  
that lacked a legislature in this period.
I think Montenegro is one of them and maybe  
the Ottoman Empire might be the other one. Japan 
had a legislature. The Russian population's sick  
of it. The war wasn't going well. They start 
hitting the streets in the Russian Revolution. 
Japan wants to advertise that to the troops.
You want things to be stirred up in  
Russia so that Russia has to pull 
troops back into European Russia. 
So they're doing all of that. Then there’s this 
gentleman. He was a colonel back in the day,  
Colonel Akashi, but he's a general by 
the time this picture is taken of him. 
He's working in the Japanese 
legation in Stockholm. 
He's busy cutting checks to Finnish and Polish 
revolutionaries who are part of the Russian Empire  
and want out, trying to stir things up there to 
have Russia forced to pull the troops out of Asia. 
Then the Japanese have this gentleman in 
there, and employing a lot of other people. 
Yuan Shikai goes on to be key in overthrowing the 
Qing dynasty and becomes China's first president. 
But back in the day, he's running reconnaissance 
missions for the Japanese and telling  
them what the Russians are up to.
When little detachments of Russian  
troops try to go out and about, these people are 
harassing them, which doesn't help Russian morale. 
Also, the Japanese are being really 
good about purchases from Manchurians. 
They aren't just taking things from 
people, they're actually paying. 
So they're triggering an economic boom in 
Manchuria, which means locals like them. 
Then the Japanese also figure out how to tap into 
Russian fleet communications so they know where  
the Russian fleet is, which is most convenient.
So this is the information element of national  
power. Then there's economics. Two-fifths of this 
war for the Japanese side is paid for with loans. 
If they don't get the loans, 
they can't wage the war. 
In fact, one of the reasons Russia 
has to call it quits at the end of  
the war is when it tries to raise a final 
loan. It failed. No one will pay for it. 
But the Japanese loans depend on 
battlefield success, as do interest rates. 
So if you are successful in the 
field, the interest rates go down. 
Japan is doing quite well with all of this.
So if you sum it all up, the Japanese  
use diplomacy to isolate their 
adversary with this UK alliance. 
They use all these psychological operations 
to promote revolution and desertions. 
They're using the military 
instrument to fund their rearmament. 
Then they've got the economics 
going with all of these loans. 
The US military is really partial 
to a Reagan-era acronym of DIME. 
D is for diplomacy, I is for information,  
M is for military, E is economics.
It sounds like a bad cheerleading routine.  
It's inadequate. It may be a place to start.
It's cute and all that stuff, but cute does  
not mean complete. Think about it. One of the 
most important factors in this war bar none,  
certainly for Russia, is railways.
I don't see an R in there or anything. 
By all means, this is better than only looking 
at military factors, but it's incomplete. 
So, I've talked about Japan's Westernization.
I've talked about its mastery of grand strategy. 
Now here's my third reason for how 
they overturn the balance of power. 
It has to do with pegging the culminating 
point of victory in the Russo-Japanese war. 
Now for a commercial break, I'm 
going to give you some terminology:  
"culminating point of attack" and "culminating 
point of victory." They're different. Culminating  
point of attack is an operational term.
If you do not reach your culminating point  
of attack, it means you could have gone further.
The culminating point of attack applies to a  
single battle or a set of battles, 
which would be called a campaign. 
If you don't go far enough in your battle, 
you could have taken more territory,  
whatever it was you were after.
If you go too far… Imagine you're  
going deep into whatever territory it is.
Your lines are ever more extended. 
Your enemy's lines are probably being shortened.
Your supply problems are getting worse,  
theirs might be getting better.
If you go way too far, your enemy will  
launch a counterattack that will send you much 
further backwards than if you'd been a little  
more cautious about how far you went. So that's 
an operational term. The strategic term is the  
"culminating point of victory" and it concerns 
the objective for which the war was fought. 
Japan is fighting this war in order to protect its 
sovereignty, and become a great power to do that. 
If you don't reach your culminating point, 
you could have gotten greater winnings. 
If you go too far, typically what will happen 
is you will trigger a third-party intervention. 
What may have been feasible before that third 
party joined the party may no longer be. 
So this is the point of the terminology.
Commercial break is over and let's get going  
on the Russo-Japanese war.
Here's a nice map of it. 
It starts out with a Japanese 
surprise attack on Port Arthur. 
Lüshun is the modern name, I'm using a 
traditional name. It's on the Liaodong  
Peninsula. This is the main Russian base.
The Japanese have to get those ships in base  
and sink them, even better.
Their supply lines are in  
danger if that navy's out and about.
Simultaneously they land an army in Korea  
that's going to go northwest into Manchuria.
If you look at the railway line, it goes Port  
Arthur all the way to Harbin up there.
That's the east-west  
junction of the Trans-Siberian Railway.
In those days that's the Chinese Eastern Railway. 
I've only listed a couple of the major 
battles, but basically it's going up the  
railway system from Port Arthur upward and 
you got the Battles of Liaoyang and Mukden. 
Japan has got only four armies until the 
very end of the war when it gets a fifth. 
As long as Port Arthur has ships in it, one 
army has to be stuck there besieging it. 
Japan's theory of victory in this thing 
is to have an annihilating battle. 
That's what Bismarck had done to 
the French in the Battle of Sedan. 
So the Japanese really need to get 
that army out of Port Arthur so  
that it can concentrate on these other battles.
What happens is Russia keeps losing the battles,  
but it has an orderly retreat moving ever 
further northward, extending Japanese lines. 
That's an overview of how the war goes so you 
can orient the rest of the conversation here. 
If you look at the invasion routes that Japan 
uses and in the First Sino-Japanese War and  
the Russo-Japanese War, they're remarkably similar 
because guess what, the geography hasn't changed. 
If you want to send an army into 
desired locations, it may well have  
to take similar routes.
The British, the French,  
the Americans, and the Japanese had studied 
very carefully the First-Sino Japanese War. 
But apparently the Russians didn't waste 
their time on it because here's what's up. 
If the Russians had studied it carefully, they 
would have known the Yalu River is lethal,  
to send an army across that if there's 
an army waiting for it on the other side. 
The Russians also would have realized 
that this Fenghuangshan Pass and Motien  
Pass—Motien means literally "scratch the 
skies"—that if you're prepared there,  
you're going to ruin an army coming through.
Of course the Russians aren't prepared there. 
They also would have known that the Liaodong 
Peninsula—it has a very narrow neck. 
If you cut the narrow neck right where Dalny is, 
a big commercial port, you're going to get that  
port which is connected to the railway.
You're going to be able to supply  
your armies going right up north.
In addition, it means you're probably  
going to get Port Arthur, the big naval base as 
well, because it's basically been turned into an  
island and you'll probably get that.
So the Russians should have figured  
out that but they didn't.
The Japanese literally blast  
through these locations.
Here is the key to  
reducing the fleet in Port Arthur.
Since the Russians wouldn't sortie,  
they're just sticking in harbor, the 
Japanese have to figure out a way to  
do it. Here's how it works. They have to get 
a bunch of these 11-inch howitzers in place. 
Japan didn't own many of these. They're really 
heavy. It's really hard to transport them with  
horses and things.
They've got to put  
them behind the hills in Port Arthur.
Then they've got to take the high point. 
It takes them a while to figure out that 
they needed to do this. It’s a 203-meter  
hill. You put a spotter on 203 Meter Hill.
This thing starts firing shots and the spotter  
starts radioing in how you have to adjust the 
line of fire in order to hit the ships in harbor. 
So that's what's going on here.
Here you can see the narrow  
neck there above Dalny.
You can see it's a big port. 
We've put a lot of ships, but 
it’s not a very protected port. 
The star is where Port Arthur is 
and that is a protected port where  
you want to put naval vessels.
You can see it takes the Japanese  
two months to work their way down the 
Liaodong Peninsula to get themselves in  
position to blow away the ships in port.
Meanwhile, the Japanese armies are having  
a hard time while this is going on.
It could be argued that maybe they  
even reached their culminating point of attack in 
the Battle of Liaoyang. Who knows? Liaoyang takes  
place less than halfway through the war. It's 
in early September 1904. And Japanese munitions,  
numbers of officers, numbers of horses… It all 
goes critical. They don't have enough. They  
get away with it. They win the battle but the 
Russians have an organized retreat northward. 
At the Battle of Shaho, which happens next 
in October, the Japanese supply system almost  
collapses but they get away with it.
So bad things are going on at land. 
Japan doesn't have an infinite supply of soldiers.
They also don't have an infinite supply of  
artillery, howitzers and things. Here are 
their gun emplacements. Notice the green  
ones are army gun emplacements around Port 
Arthur. That makes sense. What's all the  
purple? They have so few guns, they're pulling 
them off ships in order to reduce Port Arthur. 
All these things they really need up in Manchuria,
General Nogi who's running all of this,
his army up in Manchuria.
There you can see, the circle is where  
203 Meter Hill is that they need to take as well.
General Nogi, who is commanding the 3rd Army which  
is in charge of the siege, is really desperate 
to reduce the fortress as soon as possible. 
He runs four different really costly 
infantry assaults on a fortress where  
you're killing lots of young Japanese men.
The first two occur right prior to major  
battles, Liaoyang and Shaho respectively.
Because he wants to win
Port Arthur, so then he can take his guns 
and troops to fight at Liaoyang and Shaho. 
Well, it's not to be because he loses both 
of them. The assaults are insufficient.  
It's only after the second one that he 
realizes the importance of 203 Meter Hill. 
The problem is Nogi gets 45,000 Japanese 
soldiers killed doing this. 45,000  
soldiers in that day is an entire army.
I've already pointed out that Japan only  
had four armies until the very end of the war 
when it tried to cobble together a fifth one. 
Here's what 203 Meter Hill 
looks like from down below. 
Here's what it looks like from 
up top, the kind of view you get. 
When there was a truce in early December 
1904, and there was some talking between  
Japanese and Russian officers, Russian officers 
said, "You will never capture 203 Meter Hill." 
To which the Japanese officer replied, 
"We'll purchase it in blood." And they  
did. Their gamble paid off because all 
these ships, you'll notice they're listing. 
It's because they ain't sailing anywhere.
You can see the 203 Meter Hill. 
They take it at the end of November 
and within the week, they are now  
sinking all of these battleships.
They're gone within a few days. 
The Russians give up at Port Arthur and the 
3rd Army is up and heading into Manchuria where  
it'll be there for the Battle of Mukden, 
which is a huge battle. It's got what,  
500,000 troops? Even so, Russia can 
muster 125,000 more troops than Japan can. 
Japan in this battle is just taking 
anybody, young boys, old people. 
Whoever they can put into that 
army, they're putting into it. 
You could argue that they're well beyond 
their culminating point of attack,  
but for incompetent Russian strategy.
If the Russians had run one more battle  
against the Japanese, the Japanese 
supply lines would have collapsed. 
It's unclear how far down the Liaodong 
Peninsula they would have had to retreat. 
So this is when Japan's war 
termination plan goes into effect. 
The Japanese realized from the very beginning 
that they had a high-risk, high-reward strategy. 
In contrast to World War II, they had a 
really carefully prepared exit strategy. 
When Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi is convening the 
cabinet and they're going to make the decision to  
fire the first shots in this war, he is already 
lining up a Harvard grad, Viscount Kaneko,  
who was an acquaintance of the President 
Theodore Roosevelt of the United States. 
What they want is to have Viscount 
Kaneko work on getting Roosevelt ready  
to do mediation at the end of this war.
The negotiations are going to be held  
in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, negotiated 
by another Harvard alumnus, Baron Komura,  
who's going to do all of that.
Meanwhile, Ito sends his son-in-law,  
who's a Diet member but also a graduate 
of Cambridge University, off to Britain  
to keep the Anglo-Japanese Alliance solid.
So the Japanese are very aware that you  
have to have a way out of this thing.
So it's in the Battle of Mukden that  
Field Marshal Yamagata decides it's time 
to call the American card at this moment. 
He said, "Look, the enemy is never going to 
request peace unless we have invaded Moscow or St. 
Petersburg" something he knows to be impossible.
He said, "Look, the enemy still has powerful  
forces in its home country. We have already 
exhausted ours. Second, while the enemy still  
does not run out of officers, we have lost 
a great number since the opening of the war  
and cannot easily replace them."
At this moment, the Russian army  
was three times the size of the Japanese army.
That army in theater was increasingly comprised  
of crack soldiers, not the colonial kind of 
soldiers they'd started out with. So here's  
Field Marshal Yamagata. In the first Sino-Japanese 
War, the government in Tokyo was afraid he was  
going to march on Beijing and do regime change.
They pulled him out of the theater and gave him a  
sinecure to make sure he didn't do that this time.
This time, he's a wiser man. 
He goes, "We must now be prudent."
Here are other members of this  
brilliant Meiji generation.
The Chief of Staff of the  
Manchurian army said, "Look, if you 
start a fire, you’ve got to put it out." 
And here is Field Marshal Ōyama, who 
is the commander of Manchurian forces. 
Before he sets out to take command, he 
tells the navy minister, "I will care for  
fighting in Manchuria, but I'm counting 
you as the man to tell me when to quit." 
So the navy's going to be the 
fire department, apparently. 
To tell you what the navy was up to, they took 
Elliott Island to turn it into a cruiser base. 
That's how they're running the blockade operations 
on Port Arthur, keeping the Russian fleet in until  
they can eventually sink it there.
In addition, the Imperial Japanese  
Navy is busy laying mines.
A lot of ships go down to  
mines. This is an interesting story. Nicholas II, 
tsar of Russia, doesn't like it that his fleet is  
just sitting in port, not doing anything.
So he sends Admiral Makarov out there to  
assume command.
I've had the  
misfortune to read Makarov's major literary 
contribution, which is all about naval strategy. 
He's a real hero in Russia.
But then I read his book. It's unbelievable. He  
said, "If you face a big ship, what do you do?
A more powerful ship, you attack. 
If it's a smaller ship, what do you do? You 
attack." It's one size fits all. I mean,  
how unanalytical. Here's what happens to him. 
He comes into the theater and within the month,  
another spoiler alert, he's dead. How did that 
happen? He followed his strategy. That's how it  
happened. What he does, he arrives, everyone's 
really excited because he's getting the guys out  
and thinking they're going to be doing things.
But on April 12, the evening before he dies,  
there are a bunch of Japanese ships 
laying mines out at the harbor's entrance. 
He mistakes them for Russian ships and 
tells his people not to fire on them.  
Oops. The next morning, when he sorties with 
the whole fleet to take the offensive… Well,  
they didn't sweep the harbor entrance for mines.
His ship hits a mine and he goes down with a ship. 
Alright, that is a tactical error 
and he's a dead man because of it. 
However, there's a much more important 
strategic error that follows. 
Two weeks later, Nicholas II decides to send his 
Baltic Fleet, named for the Baltic where it is,  
all the way around to come and 
relieve the siege at Port Arthur  
in order to avenge all of this thing.
Okay, what's the problem with that plan? 
Well, that's the problem with that plan, right?
It's a long way to go. 
There is no air conditioning for the 
sailors. They come from northern climes.  
By the time they arrive, they're mutinous.
Their ships are covered with barnacles,  
which means they don't move very fast.
Meanwhile, once Port Arthur has fallen,  
the Japanese immediately refit 
their navy so they were good to go. 
So the way this blunder plays out… 
Well, if you think about Britain,  
Britain will do these worldwide adventures, but 
they had a complete basing system across the  
globe so that their ships had coaling stations, 
they could refit, put more water on, give people  
some R&R time, relaxation and things.
Also the British were very careful  
to fight on their own terms as ever possible.
You don't want to fight on the enemy's terms. 
Well guess what, you're going 
to be fighting right next to  
Japan with barnacle ships and mutinous crews.
That's not going to go well for you. 
The Japanese know because…Port Arthur falls 
while this expedition is taking place. 
So then the purpose of the 
expedition is no longer there. 
They should have taken a U-turn and gone home.
But no, no, no, they're going to keep on going. 
There is only one other possible location for them 
which is a far inferior base up in Vladivostok. 
The Japanese know there are 
three ways to get to Vladivostok. 
If you're coming up from the south, 
you're either going to go the long,  
long way around through La Pérouse Strait and 
it's awfully narrow and it's a long way around. 
You can go through the Tsugaru 
Strait which is a little wider,  
but it goes by a bunch of big Japanese army 
bases and also a very large port of Hakodate.  
You want to do that? That's kind of risky. So 
the short way is to go through the Korea Strait  
which is broken in the middle by the Tsushima 
Islands and the Tsushima Strait is to the east. 
It's 20-25 miles wide at its narrowest point.
That's the short way which is what the Russians  
take. Guess what? They have a welcoming party 
there of all these newly refitted Japanese  
ships that know exactly what they're up to.
The Battle of Tsushima is one of the most  
lopsided naval battles in human history.
The Japanese just either sink or commandeer  
basically the entire fleet, proving the Russians 
had no idea of how to do naval strategy. 
The navy had been a product 
of a bunch of aristocrats. 
The one who ran it was a guy who was known 
for, what was it, fast women and slow ships? 
It did not work out well for them.
While the negotiations are being  
held on whether to hold negotiations, 
President Roosevelt suggested to the  
Japanese that they try to take Sakhalin Island.
You can see the tip end of the Japanese home  
island, Hokkaido and then there's Sakhalin. 
Why? Because it's much more valuable to the  
Russians than the Japanese and it'd be a good 
tradeback item in the peace negotiations. 
Because for Japan it's a nice fishing ground.
But for Russia it's sovereign Russian territory. 
Horror ceding that sovereign Russian 
territory to anyone, let alone an Asian  
power given the prejudices of the day.
To sum up what Japan got out of this war,  
it got its immediate war objective, Russian 
troop withdrawal from Manchuria. That's what  
they wanted. They get this Japanese sphere of 
influence in Korea. That's what they wanted.  
But remember at the very beginning they wanted 
to trade Japanese predominance in Korea for  
Russian predominance in Manchuria?
Let's look at what they really got. 
They got the southern half of 
Sakhalin Island, Russian territory.  
They got southern Manchuria. It's actually 
arguably the valuable half, the southern half,  
because it has Port Arthur and Dalny and all 
the railways that Russians had invested there. 
Then it confirms the outcome of the First 
Sino-Japanese war that Japan is indeed the  
dominant power of Asia. So I rest my case. 
Japan did it. Smart decisions in Japan are  
what overturn the balance of power in Asia.
Okay, but I promised you a counterargument. 
What would a smart person 
say who disagrees with me? 
Here's a perfectly good counter argument.
It's great you think the Japanese are so  
clever, but actually China faced 
a perfect storm of catastrophes. 
Because China imploded, that's why 
it leaves Japan on top in Asia. 
The primary factor is that China's falling 
apart and this perfect storm of problems.  
I'll go through three. It's always a good 
number. People can remember three things.  
You have the civil wars afflicting China, in 
an age of accelerating European imperialism. 
Also the Manchus who ran China, they're only 2% of 
the population, were suffering from all kinds of  
dynastic decline, which I will get into.
China had reached its preindustrial  
limits to growth.
Its population kept  
on going up and up, but its agricultural 
productivity just could not feed people. 
So people are trying to 
farm really marginal lands. 
Either they're too vertical or 
they don't have reliable rainfall. 
You're getting massive soil 
erosion doing these things. 
You're also getting a lot of famines.
Famines are both the cause and  
the effect of civil wars.
On this map you can just see,  
I've named some of the big rebellions on this one.
It's to give you a sense that these rebellions  
affect all of China.
It’s not just a little  
here and there, but a lot everywhere.
Now I'm going to give you a table. 
This is a simplified table 
which only goes 1845-1895. 
It's part of a much bigger table that 
would cover the entire 19th century. 
And that table is an oversimplification.
So the point is this is not business as usual. 
In the red box, that is the height 
of these rebellions, 1851-1878. 
The biggest rebellion there is the Taiping.
It's estimated that 20 million  
people died in the Taiping Rebellion.
To put that figure in perspective… People don't  
know how many people died in all these things.
China didn't know how many people they had,  
much less how many people they lost.
But to give you a sense of it, in World  
War II it's estimated that 55 million people died.
So you're talking 20 million just in the Taiping. 
I have no idea how all this 
adds up, but it's huge. 
The Chinese like to talk about these as being 
rebellions or uprisings. Give me a break.  
They're civil wars. A whole bunch of them 
want to overthrow the dynasty in Beijing. 
A whole other set of them want 
to secede from the empire. 
Often these minority people who just want 
the Han, the predominant people, to go away,  
or the Manchus in this era.
Some of these provinces  
are devastated for generations.
So that's point one, these civil wars. 
Point two is that this coincided with an 
era of accelerating European imperialism,  
where Europeans and also the Japanese are carving 
out massive spheres of influence for themselves. 
The Chinese are not going to have full sovereignty 
over their country for a very, very long time.  
The story gets even worse. This happens to China 
because China loses a succession of regional wars. 
It loses the First Opium War, the Second Opium 
War, the Japanese snag the Ryukyu Islands. 
Then in the Sino-French War, China 
loses control over Indochina. 
Then in the Sino-Japanese War, they're 
losing their tributary of Korea. 
The Ili crisis is up in Xinjiang, which goes 
a little better for them. This is a mess.  
This is not business as usual.
Think about one country being  
afflicted by this much trouble.
Then it comes at a time when the  
Manchus are in real trouble themselves.
They had ridden to power on these fabulous  
cavalries and tremendous operational 
success for a people who are only 2%  
of the population that they dominate.
They transform China into the richest  
polity around the globe by the 18th century. But 
here's the problem. With their tremendous success  
in their military campaign. They're overextending 
China financially. Inside the round circle there,  
that's China proper.
These are the core  
provinces of China that produce all the income.
The Manchus came in from Manchuria up there,  
but they also take Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet.
Not Manchuria so much, but the other ones,  
they cost a lot of garrisoning.
It costs a lot of money to garrison these places. 
It looks like a great success, but 
it's going to have problems later on. 
Then here's what happens to the Manchu emperors.
They no longer ride at the head of their armies. 
The Qianlong Emperor, who's considered to 
have ruled at the height of the dynasty,  
what's he spending his money on?
All sorts of interesting architectural programs. 
That's why people think he's great, he builds 
beautiful things. But these emperors are isolated.  
They don't have command experience, expensive 
spending habits. Then it gets better. So they  
got all these tributaries.
Some of their tributaries  
produce really high quality opium.
The emperors decide they want to sample  
the goods, and the people who are preparing 
it for them also want to sample the goods. 
Then the Manchu banner forces that 
are the Praetorian Guard of the  
Manchus are also sampling the goods.
Then you go, why are the last Qing  
emperors incapable of producing 
offspring or have hardly any? 
They have huge harems, so what's their problem?
Well, if you're really totally high on drugs,  
you can ruin yourself.
So that is what goes on. 
No wonder they're losing these wars, if some of 
your key thinkers are not thinking very clearly. 
So the counter argument to my 
argument says, "Look, it's nonsense. 
The Japanese may have been really clever, but 
the real big event is this massive series of  
civil wars, European imperialism, and 
the collapse of Manchu minority rule. 
That would be the real thing."
Now, if I leave my argument here,  
I've just shot myself in the foot because I've 
just decimated my original argument with a  
pretty good counterargument. That would be bad. 
That would hurt. So you need to do a rebuttal. 
It's really good to come 
from an unexpected direction. 
So I'm going to try my direction, 
which is going to be Russia. 
I’d say, "Look, Russia is the catalyst.
It's taking advantage of the collapse of China,  
and it's going to catalyze things in 
a way that Japan is going to leverage. 
It's going to be Japan leveraging these things.
That proves that smart decisions in  
Tokyo answers the question."
So what's going on with Russia? 
Russia has always tried to expand its territory.
It is today the largest country on the planet. 
Why they need more territory, nobody knows. 
But that's what they're after. And these days  
what they're taking are those two large areas.
By the time the Bolsheviks finish working their  
magic, Russians have taken from the Chinese sphere 
of influence —the Bolsheviks are beyond today,  
but it gives you a sense— more territory than 
the United States east of the Mississippi.  
That's a lot of territory. But in this day, 
while the Opium Wars are going on and while  
the Taiping and Nian Rebellions, the two 
big ones, are happening simultaneously,  
the Russians go to the Qing and say, "Hey, 
we'll deal with those foreigners for you. 
We'll be an intermediary, but just sign 
on the dotted line for these treaties  
giving us all this land."
The Chinese were vague on  
geography and they didn't believe in treaties.
They thought they'd get it back later. 
So Russia gets all this stuff, 
does exactly nothing because  
we know about the treaty port system.
The British and French got all of it.  
Russia got this stuff too. Once Russia gets 
this stuff, that's why they want the railway,  
because they want to integrate it there.
So the Trans-Siberian Railway is the blue thing,  
but understand that the blue part that's above the 
green part, that wasn't built until World War I. 
Russia built the green part, which is the 
Chinese Eastern Railway, the name of it,  
in order to stake out its plans for empire.
Also notice it wants the warm water port,  
that's the orange part going down to Port 
Arthur, because Vladivostok, prior to the  
age of icebreakers, is frozen solid several 
months of the year. So Russia's building this  
railway. To save on construction costs, it's 
more direct going straight across Manchuria. 
Contain Japan, stake out its claim to 
Manchuria. The Japanese get it. Well,  
that was earlier in this lecture.
They see this coming and they don't like it. 
Then in addition to what's going on, the 
Chinese don't particularly like all the  
imperialists messing with their country.
And so the Boxers are another rebellion. 
These folks want all Westerners out of 
China and they want to kill any stragglers. 
They're all over China, they go into Manchuria.
The Russians send 100,000 troops, far more than  
any of the European powers or even Japan 
which sends a lot, to the rest of China  
to defeat the Boxers, which they do.
Then the other Westerners in Japan  
remove their troops, Russia doesn't.
This is the thing that gets Japan's  
attention, because Russia's got 100,000 
troops in Manchuria that won't leave. 
That's when Japan is sick of Russia 
procrastinating and we're going to wind up getting  
into the Russo-Japanese War. So guess what? 
We're back to my original explanation, right? 
The Japanese finessed all of 
this and they wound up on top. 
It's by being very thoughtful in their grand 
strategy that they reverse the balance of power. 
I'm going to end this thing 
with General Nogi and a poem. 
General Nogi is the one who oversaw 
the four assaults on Port Arthur. 
He lost both of his sons in this war.
One in the Battle of Nanshan, which is  
down the Liaodong Peninsula, and then his other, 
his favorite, under his command in Port Arthur. 
When the war was over, he asked the Meiji 
Emperor if he could commit ritual suicide,  
and the Emperor said no.
So when the Meiji Emperor  
died, he and his wife did.
This poem helps explain why: 
"Imperial troops, a million strong,
conquered an arrogant enemy; 
But siege and field warfare left
a mountain of corpses. 
Ashamed,what face can
I show to old parents? 
How many men have returned
this day of triumphal song?"  
Wars bring much sorrow. I leave you with 
that. Thank you very much for your attention. 
I loved this lecture and this topic 
especially, because it's about a  
conflict that many of us weren't educated on.
But it adds context to the other ones which are  
obviously super famous, like World War II.
It adds context to the development of these  
powers, which are the most powerful in Asia.
I'm not going to keep wasting time. 
I just want to jump into asking you 
a bunch of questions about this. 
One way you can explain Russia's loss 
here is that Japan had better tactics. 
Given the fact that they had deployed 
similar amounts of men to the front,  
Japan with their better tactics, was 
able to win in these different battles. 
But maybe the more important thing to explain 
is why Russia didn't deploy more men or didn't  
deploy its greater resources.
Russia's population is over 130  
million people at this point.
Japan's is 47 million or so. 
You might say that the Trans-Siberian 
Railway isn't completed by this point. 
But in 1905, it actually is complete.
So Russia could have continued the war. 
It has all these fresh troops it could send.
Why didn't they have the same will, or the  
same ability, to muster their massive 
resources, that Japan brought to bear? 
One is that the railway is a bottleneck.
Japan's starting the war deliberately while  
that bottleneck is bottled. That's one factor. 
Russia has massive troops. Also, the Russians  
are arrogant. They think Japanese… Initially, 
the Russians think they're going to do regime  
change in Tokyo. That's their plan. How they plan 
to get to Tokyo is a mystery, but never mind. 
So they don't realize what they need.
It's a fairly common problem in wars,  
a gross underestimation of the other side.
That's what's going on in Ukraine right now. Putin  
missed that one. He's not the only one. Hitler 
underestimated the Russians in World War II. 
Then you go, "What's going on with Japan?"
With those Meiji reforms,  
they have an educated population.
Russian soldiers are a bunch of illiterates. 
And the Russian soldiers are going, "What?
Why are we fighting in Manchuria? 
Tell me precisely why I'm here getting killed."
The Russian soldiers had no buy-in. 
You can ask what exactly 
did the Russians want there. 
Apparently, there were some royal favorites who 
thought that they were going to get some lucrative  
timber concessions on the Korean border.
Okay, let's go into the logistics. 
I've never heard there was a shortage 
of wood in European Russia, ever. 
And they're going to ship it all the way back?
This is a non-performing economic model. 
In addition, Nicholas II is an incompetent tsar.
He's hiring the guy who's running  
the navy who is also incompetent.
Their navy gets no training whatsoever. 
Great, you have expensive ships, but 
no one's trained in how to use them,  
whereas the Japanese have.
For the Japanese, it's the  
value of the object, one of these concepts.
How valuable is it to win for Japan versus Russia? 
For Russia, it's already the biggest country 
on the planet and there's nothing really that  
exciting out in Asia from their point of view.
Maybe for Nicholas II, because he wants  
to be a great tsar and add to the 
empire, that would be a nice thing. 
But when the Germans come after him 
in World War I, I think he's going  
to care about the other things more.
For the Japanese, rightly or wrongly,  
their government and educated 
people consider it existential. 
They're looking at China going, that's 
our future if we don't fix things. 
They're thinking the solution for Japan is empire, 
because in those days that seemed to be the way  
powerful countries ran things.
It's a combination of  
legitimate logistical bottlenecks.
Japan, since they're going to be  
starting this thing, has massive preparations.
The Russians aren't planning to fight this thing. 
They're thinking, "I determine whether 
wars begin or end." Excuse me, they don't. 
So I guess you're saying Russia doesn't 
care about this conflict as much as… 
Russians. Tsar Nicholas II might, 
but his population is fighting it. 
So then he doesn't have the 
state capacity to mobilize his… 
That's the whole problem with Russia.
This is the power of institutions. Japan  
clearly can mobilize. Boy, is it doing well with 
the loans and all sorts of things. It's using  
these institutions. Whereas with Russia, 
remember, it doesn't have a legislature. 
The Tsar doesn't have a cabinet in the same sense.
He has ministers, but they don't ever show up at  
his house at the same time to sit around a table.
He's just doing them one at a time. 
Then the Romanov family has lots of first cousins.
Everybody's having lots of kids, and so you've  
got a million first cousins.
They are all deployed throughout  
the ministries, basically being the spy system 
for the Romanov family for what's going on. 
Are any of these nice rich boys 
particularly competent? No. 
I want to understand, in World War I, 
they were able to mobilize many more men. 
Obviously there was incompetence in World 
War I as well, but the sheer amount of  
resources the Tsar was able to bring 
to the Far East during this conflict… 
Look at a map and you'll see the railway grid 
is much more extensive in European Russia. 
This is where Count Sergei Witte, their 
finest minister of late tsarist period,  
he's the one who's trying to do his version of 
a Meiji Restoration in his purview, which is the  
Finance Ministry, financing all these railways.
So there are many more railways. 
This is where Russia's population is.
This is where their historical  
security threats come from.
Russians can get on board with  
protecting European borders.
Once the Trans-Siberian  
Railway is finished in 1905…
Just the part in Manchuria. The  
one that goes on their side of the 
boundaries not completed until World War I. 
I want to double click on what part of the Meiji 
reformations exactly helped Japan mobilize for  
this war. Okay, the population is literate. 
You have institutions for having political say. 
How exactly does that help you 
have more people go to the front? 
I don't know the answer, but the Japanese… 
Talk about a culture that's about detail,  
about hard work, about service to the emperor.
I've done in your earlier podcast series  
a whole series about bushido.
They're imbued with service to  
the emperor and if you go fight wars, you win 
them. That's part of their culture. Russians  
also don't like being messed with when people 
invade them, but this time they're invading other  
people in an irrelevant part of the empire.
It's at a time when Russia is trying to  
industrialize itself, but they haven't put 
enough money into their education system. 
So they have a bunch of 
illiterate troops running around. 
Let's face it, how can you read 
any of the manuals or do anything? 
Some of their generals, one of them 
didn't know what a howitzer was. 
One of the guys who's planning 
stuff, he can't read maps. 
The level of incompetence of having 
royal favorites in your officer corps,  
they make these decisions.
Also, there's split command  
in the Russo-Japanese War.
There's General Kuropatkin,  
who is the professional who actually 
had fought against the Ottomans. 
But those are colonial wars, and he'd won 
some of those. He's a professional. But then  
Admiral Alekseyev—who's the illegitimate son of, 
I can't remember which Tsar, and a favorite uncle,  
I believe, of Nicholas II—he's out there and 
no one knows who's actually in command, except  
the royal favorite is probably the better bet.
So Kuropatkin wants to not engage the Japanese  
until they're way inland, because he wants 
to extend their lines and then clobber them. 
All these aristocrats who don't know what they're 
talking about say, "No, no, no, no, no, we're not  
going to let these racial inferiors do whatever.
We're going to take them on immediately." Okay,  
try that. Kuropatkin's strategy 
probably would have worked. 
Just bring them inland and let them 
enjoy it, like with Napoleon Bonaparte. 
You want to get to Moscow, have 
at it. Then try winter in Moscow. 
One really interesting takeaway from this 
lecture—and I'm curious if you agree with  
this—is that when we think about this 
period in history, we often think of  
Japan as the rising power in Asia.
But it seems like the takeaway  
here is Russia was actually on the 
path to be the dominant power here. 
Their population is so much bigger.
If the efforts to modernize had worked,  
they would have had a 4x bigger population.
Then they could have had the  
modern industry Japan has.
Were it not, later on obviously,  
for the Bolshevik Revolution and the Civil War and 
collectivization, Russia would be dominant. Japan,  
seeing this, acts early. I guess I didn't 
put it in those terms before I heard this  
lecture. Would you agree with that?
I'm going to give you a tangential  
answer, then you tell me what I'm missing.
The sorrow of Russia is that they have this  
incredible land, natural resources, and the works.
They're really hung up on empire,  
having lots of territory.
They live in a difficult neighborhood. 
Witte is telling Nicholas, forget 
about the Asian adventures. 
We need to build more railways in European 
Russia. He was right. Because if they could  
have mobilized better in World War I, 
you might get some different outcomes. 
Also, you might have avoided the food riots in St.
Petersburg, which toppled the Romanov dynasty. 
If you'd actually provided enough food to St.
Petersburg, maybe you don't have those riots  
because you have the railways running and things.
So Russia is a story of misinvestment. Look at it  
today. If Putin had taken all of his oil money and 
invested it in the transportation grid… Believe it  
or not, Russia still just does things by train.
Its road systems are appallingly bad. 
If Russia actually cleaned up its legal system, 
which under the tsars it hadn't done either,  
everything was always royal monopolies… If 
they had cleaned up these things to allow  
individuals to make their own investments and make 
money, it'd be a completely different story. But  
tsars couldn't stand merchants. Communists 
hated them even more. There are cultural  
differences. The Russians aren't known for being 
meticulous and hard working the way Japanese are. 
Russians are known to be hard drinkers.
They're also known for being brutal. 
Let me take another different stab at your thesis.
Go for it. 
It's not Japan's strategic brilliance, 
which mainly explains why they won the war,  
but rather the fact that Russia could have kept 
going even after the Baltic Fleet was sunk,  
even after they've lost in Mukden.
But what changes is in 1905 you  
have this massive peasant revolution.
You have mass strikes in the cities. 
You have Bloody Sunday in January.
So the Tsar’s government almost collapses  
to the point that he has to at least give 
the perception of instituting major reforms. 
Unclear whether it was going to collapse.
This is maybe a tangent but when I had Stephen  
Kotkin, the Stalin biographer, on…
He might know more about it.. 
So Japan cannot claim credit for the fact that 
there were these long-standing issues in Russia  
which almost brought down the government in 1905.
This was a lucky break that they got which forced  
Russia and the Tsar to reallocate 
their efforts from the fight. 
That's a good argument. He might be right. We'll 
never get definitive answers because you'd have  
to be in Nicholas II's brain. It's an autocracy. 
What he decides matters. I dare say if he had been  
Peter the Great, the guy who tortured his only 
son to death and suffered numerous setbacks,  
I doubt that he would have had any 
problems dealing with rioting Russians. 
He would have figured out who 
are loyal units and then just  
blown away whatever's getting in his way.
He would have done his next battle and then  
when he won that battle the Russian Revolution 
would have gone away because they would have gone,  
"See we did it. We got these people." 
So Kotkin's argument is a very good one. 
But to me, Nicholas II’s incompetent 
leadership is the bigger thing. 
Then you're arguing about how important 
the rebellion is and how deep rooted it  
is and you'll never know. Kotkin could 
be absolutely right. One of the reasons  
I gave the counterargument is to get used to 
understanding ambiguity and appreciating that  
other people could be right. You may not know.
To be clear, I don't want to put words in Kotkin’s  
mouth so I'll just put them in my mouth.
I won't blame him for any errors I make. 
Another thing that is super interesting in this 
period is that it potentially helps explain  
why Japan thought that Pearl Harbor might work.
Superficially these two situations seem similar. 
In both cases you begin with this imminent 
threat that an adversary of yours is going  
to gain massive military leverage over you.
In the 1904 war with Russia, it’s the fact that  
the Trans-Siberian Railway would be finished.
In World War II, it's the worry that after  
Japan invades French Indochina, America would 
do an oil embargo on Japan, giving them one  
to two years of oil runway before their entire 
empires collapses and grinds to halt without oil. 
There's this worry that they have to act now, 
otherwise they're about to lose their leverage. 
Then there's this initial surprise attack, of Port 
Arthur in 1904, and then obviously Pearl Harbor. 
Even if you look at other battles like 
Midway and Mukden, we'll have this  
sort of annihilating battle where we will 
expend our blood and just push them back. 
I’m curious to get your 
take on this interpretation. 
In both cases, Japan is seeing 
a window of opportunity. 
It has to operate in this 
window and get it over with. 
If you're doing that, that's a high 
risk strategy to get away with it. 
This goes back to the "they 
were just lucky" argument. 
Another thing is that, you can 
look at why certain wars turn out. 
Another concept is a cooperative adversary. 
What's a cooperative adversary? It's not  
one that wants to cooperate with you, but it's 
one that doesn't play its cards remotely well. 
If you think about literally playing 
cards, if you're playing a game  
with a little child, they're trying to win.
But they're a cooperative adversary because they  
just don't know how to play whatever the game is.
You could argue that Nicholas II is a cooperative  
adversary, and that's required.
The United States is not remotely  
a cooperative adversary, and it goes really 
badly for Japan. Also, there’s another piece.  
When you run one successful war, quite often 
you think it was easier than it actually was  
and less risky than it actually was.
This country does Gulf I where  
the allies pay for the whole thing.
No Americans die, hardly at all,  
loads of Iraqis die.
They're out of Kuwait  
within days. Wow. Then people are complaining 
we should have marched on to Baghdad. We did  
that. That didn't work out so well.
But after you do one of these things,  
you think you're good to go.
In Japan's case, between the Sino-Japanese  
War and the Russo-Japanese War, it shifted the 
balance of civil and military power in Japan. 
People thought that it was the military 
officers that did the right thing and that  
the diplomats lost the peace.
In the Russo-Japanese War,  
they're saying that they didn't get a big 
indemnity as they did in the last war. 
You're getting the whole Russian railway system.
That's an indemnity in kind,  
but that's not what they're seeing.
It shifts the balance of power. 
In addition, this Meiji generation, the prime 
civil leader, Itō Hirobumi, is assassinated by  
a Korean revolutionary, because the Koreans don't 
much like the Japanese in their empire. He dies.  
It's a decade-plus before Yamagata does.
That gives Yamagata and military friends  
another decade to insinuate the 
roots of military institutions,  
and civil institutions are not being built.
Then you can go, "Look at the Japanese,  
they're incompetent because their 
institution building was inadequate." 
Well in one generation, you can't do it all.
Institutions take generations  
to really sink roots.
They did as much as they could  
in a generation, but their leadership was bereft 
compared to… This is why the Meiji generation is  
truly a brilliant set of leaders, and what comes 
after, their children and grandchildren, are not. 
This is also another very important point.
The fact that the civilian leader of the  
Meiji generation dies before the military 
leader reinforces the contingency of history. 
It didn't have to be that he died first, 
but then that sort of changes potentially  
the whole trajectory of history.
Individuals, trends, the whole thing  
matters. There's no saying. Maybe if he'd stuck 
around, everything would have been the same. 
Since you can't rerun the experiment, this 
is where, again, counterarguments are useful. 
On so many human endeavors, you 
just don't have complete data. 
When you're doing things in the here and now, 
maybe the data will come in a little later,  
or it just doesn't exist.
Yet you have to make decisions. 
If you're not willing to change your mind, you're 
just going to double down on bad decisions. 
It's incredible the number of people 
who don't want to change their minds. 
That's why I made a big to-do about giving the 
argument-counterargument-rebuttal framework,  
because it helps get you out of the 
rut so that you can change your mind. 
You're going to tell me that Kotkin's got this 
thing and I'm wrong. I'm game. Maybe he's right.  
I don't care who's right. I care what's right.
Going back to the question of what was different  
between the Russo-Japanese War and World 
War II, and what Japan's miscalculation was. 
One of them has to be that, in the case of Russia, 
they attacked an adversary where it took one  
year of conflict to push them to the point of 
significant destabilization of the government. 
Whereas, if you thought the same thing 
would happen with America… "We're going  
to attack Pearl Harbor and there's going 
to be all kinds of internal conflict." 
They just misjudged the internal level of cohesion 
and functionality of American institutions. 
They thought the same thing that 
happened in Russia would happen. 
They're missing the whole war. Their war is 
with China. Instead of isolating the adversary,  
they bring in a whole new slew of adversaries. 
They're having trouble with China. That's the  
Second Sino-Japanese War. We get all excited when 
we're involved, but it starts in 1931 and their  
objective soon becomes an unlimited objective.
They eventually want to do regime change in China. 
Whereas in the First Sino-Japanese War, 
Yamagata is thinking about doing regime  
change and the government pulls him out 
because it's, "Buddy, don't do that. 
We're going to have all kinds of 
foreign powers intervening if you try." 
In the Russo-Japanese War, they're not 
trying to do regime change in Russia. 
But in the Second Sino-Japanese War, they 
absolutely are trying to do regime change. 
They get more and more frustrated.
Their solution to that one is to  
attack all the colonial interests in Asia. 
That's when Pearl Harbor happens. Then  
they're bringing in us, the British, and 
that brings in the British Commonwealth. 
Australia and New Zealand do significant fighting, 
and then the Netherlands. It's a different event. 
I want to go back to the Meiji reforms and 
the Iwakura Mission, which was sent to Prussia  
to understand what Bismarck did right.
I think it's funny because Sergei Witte,  
who's the finance minister from 1892 to 
1902, models himself as Russia's Bismarck. 
He wants to do the kind of industrialization 
that Germany went through, in Russia. 
Yet the Meiji generation succeeds in 
Japan in doing this kind of thing. 
In both cases, there's an authoritarian government 
that wants to have this kind of top-down reform. 
Why does it work in Japan but not in Russia?
Russia just has a phenomenal illiteracy rate. 
It's an empire, which gets in the way.
If you look at how many non-Russian  
people they're trying to dominate, 
they're perennially overextended. 
They're perennially occupying places 
that don't actually make them much money. 
In fact, they probably cost them more 
money to hang on to. They’re perennially  
doing that. I believe the Japanese are 
known to be incredibly hardworking. 
I believe the Chinese are 
known to be very hardworking. 
I have never heard anyone say the Russians 
are known to be hardworking. Maybe I missed  
something. I've heard they're like artists and 
they have the russkaya dusha, their soul. Okay,  
great. That's like a big excuse for saying, "We 
may fail at everything, but our soul is superior." 
There are these other things that are at work.
With Germany, it's the center of Europe. 
It's a highly developed place, and it 
already has high levels of literacy. 
There's a lot more to work with in Germany. It 
already has better infrastructure. For Russia,  
it's huge when you're trying to build railway 
systems, just enormous. Think about the  
Trans-Siberian. If you just took all that track, 
just length, and put it all over European Russia,  
you'd really have something there.
This is a quote from Sun Yat-sen,  
who was the first and short-lived 
leader of the Chinese Republic in 1912. 
He says, "We regarded the Russian defeat by 
Japan as a defeat of the West by the East. 
We regarded the Japanese 
victory as our own victory." 
Now, we know that just 10 years prior, 
China and Japan had fought a war together. 
We know that in 20 years, there's going 
to be a brutal invasion of China by  
Japan where millions of Chinese will die.
Help me understand why during this period,  
at least to the Chinese revolutionaries 
and reformers, it seems like Japan is  
the power to emulate.
First of all, he's the  
founding father of modern China.
It's one of the few things that  
the Taiwanese and the PRC agree on, that 
he's the founding father of modern China  
and it's positive what they think about him.
Remember when I told you in the Russo-Japanese  
War how they're paying for everything 
in Manchuria, that the Chinese actually  
thought that it would be a good thing.
Also understand that when the Manchus lose…  
In Chinese, the war is called the 
Qing-Japanese War, the Manchu-Japanese War. 
The Japanese are defeating the Manchus, who 
you may not particularly like if you're a Han  
nationalist. You can relate to that. The Japanese 
got in and out of that thing. That's the key. The  
really, really, ugly, brutal stuff is going to 
happen in the Second Sino-Japanese War where  
the Japanese do things that are unforgivable.
The problem for the First Sino-Japanese War is  
that it's detonating Confucianism.
What's it going to replace that with? 
Sun Yat-sen is going to do 
nationalism and work it that way. 
I think that's the big answer, but you're 
quite right that as things went on,  
as it sinks in that Japan is the dominant 
player in Asia… Because first you have a war  
and that's happened, but you're focusing 
on all your civil wars and other stuff. 
It hasn't sunk in that this is not an exception.
It's going to go on for a century. 
I suspect that it's gradual for the Chinese to 
get really upset about Japanese in particular. 
It's what they did in the 
Second Sino-Japanese War. 
It's unbelievable, because when 
they start losing, they get brutal. 
Something that wasn't emphasized in the lecture, 
but it seems quite important in explaining why  
Japan was able to be so dominant in 
this period, is that despite the fact  
that it has a much smaller population.
China at this time is 400-450 million  
people. Russia is 130 million. What's 
going on in Japan? The Meiji reforms,  
what specifically are they enabling?
If you look at the fraction of GDP that  
China is spending on defense… The country 
sort of imploded, so it's less than 1%. 
Russia is also not spending nearly 
as much of its output on defense. 
Japan in the preceding 10 years is 
spending 5% of output on defense. 
In 1904 it’s spending 10% of output on defense.
That ability to marshal… It's a smaller place,  
but you can marshal the whole of 
resources towards this defense effort. 
It seems very important to understand.
It is, but there's another piece. 
China is not really a 
unified state in this period. 
If you think about what people's 
loyalties are, it's to province and place. 
It's not to the whole of China.
They're all part of it, but it's  
the place. I'll give you an example. 
China has three fleets. The one that  
I've been talking about is the northern fleet.
In the Sino-French War, the southern Fujian Fleet  
that’s fighting in Indochina in those days, wanted 
the northern fleet to come down and help them. 
The northern fleet says, "Hell no."
In the Sino-Japanese War, when the  
northern fleet wanted the southern fleet 
to come help it, the answer was, "Hell no." 
It also has to do with how these forces are being 
financed. Provincial governors are financing it.  
They want to use these forces for the province.
They don't want to send it out of province. 
In the traditional world where China is just 
worrying about some barbarians on horses way  
off and wherever, that works well enough.
Because if they come riding in,  
you can probably eventually deal with it 
in Province 1 and it'll eventually work. 
But all of a sudden, these Western powers 
come and then the Chinese very foolishly  
fight in the treaty ports.
What they should have done is said,  
"Hey, come on in 25 miles and see how you like 
it. Alright, let's try 50." The British would  
have had real trouble with that.
It's a real failure of strategy  
that they can just own.
They love to complain,  
the Chinese today, about foreign imperialists.
They don't look at their own gross incompetence. 
This country we're dealing with, Britain's 
a lot closer to us than it was to China. 
Their population was larger 
than the American colonists. 
George Washington and friends gave them a run for 
their money. The Chinese, what's their problem?  
They should have been able to deal with it.
It's a case of lacking leadership,  
lacking institutions. These things matter. 
Even if you have all the resources in the  
world… So this country needs to watch it.
We may have all the resources in the world,  
but if we don't organize ourselves appropriately, 
or if we do a whole bunch of own goals with our  
own leadership, it will cause problems.
Talk about the long-run  
institutional effects of history.
You just mentioned how the provincial governments  
controlled a large share of Chinese resources.
You go from that period under the Qing Dynasty  
to the Republic, then you have the Warlord 
Era, then you have the Japanese in control  
of parts of the country, and then you have the 
Communists or Nationalists, and then Communists. 
But after five different regime 
changes, you have this dynamic in China. 
Today, in the US 50% of government 
spending is done at the federal level,  
50% is done at the state level.
In China, it's 85% at the local  
level, 15% at the national level.
A big problem recently has been the  
fact that the local government has financed a lot 
of construction that wasn't economically valuable. 
But you can go back more than 100 years to 
this period and the same problem of provincial  
governance still comes up again.
Under the Qing,  
local areas had to finance all of the government.
The central government financed hardly anything. 
That was always a problem and 
led to massive corruption. 
Because if you don't have a budget, then you 
have to have some way of getting graft or  
something from people to pay for things.
This is enduring and it's a different  
institutional setup of how you're going to 
run things. Institutions matter. They channel  
decision making. They channel how money 
can or can't be made. It's consequential. 
Part of the reason that Russia loses is 
that this is not the main priority for them. 
But, if that's the case, before the war, 
Japan produced an agreement which would  
allow Russia to maintain their sphere of 
control over Manchuria and Japan to maintain  
their sphere of control over Korea.
Russia refuses this and that's why  
Japan decides to do the surprise attack.
Obviously, after the war, Russia is in a  
much more disadvantageous position.
Do we understand why they were not  
game to consider this before the war?
It's a gross underestimation of the enemy. 
They're thinking these people 
are a bunch of nobodies. 
Nicholas II had an unfortunate incident in Japan.
Who knows whether this influenced him or not. 
He does the royal tour 
while his dad's still alive. 
He goes all the way around, winds up in 
Japan, and a samurai there or somebody  
tries to assassinate him with a sword.
Nicholas always has a scar up here. 
I imagine that didn't leave 
happy memories for the Tsarevich. 
It is a pretty cool story, though. "I almost got 
assassinated by a samurai and here's my scar." 
Yes, whatever. Anyway, 
that's what happened to him. 
It's the feeling that there's no need. 
It goes back to grossly underestimating 
other people and the problem with racism. 
You think you're so special and other people 
are so unspecial. Wrong. And the Japanese  
are amazing. Think about it. They're in 
the Group of Seven of major economies. 
Its major economies and major democracies.
They're the only non-Western power there. 
They don't get there out of charity.
It's out of their own achievements.  
It's an enormous achievement. What's tragic 
about World War II is if they hadn't done that,  
people would be looking at the Meiji reforms 
in order to model what they're going to do  
to get over the hump and develop.
In fact, a lot of the things that  
Deng Xiaoping does in terms of investments 
and things rhymes with the Meiji reforms. 
If you look at the four little tigers, originally 
Singapore, Hong Kong, Korea, and Taiwan,  
a lot of their development parallels 
a lot of what the Meiji reformers did. 
These are Japanese ideas, but they're 
not getting credit for them because  
of the brutality of World War II.
You're thinking of that and thinking,  
"If I say nice things about Japan, 
I'm endorsing this other stuff." 
No, they're two separate 
topics, different generations. 
I want to better understand the degree to 
which the level of technology in a country  
matters for its military capabilities.
At this time, countries are just buying  
armaments from more advanced countries.
In the 1894 war, China bought two German  
battleships and many other vessels. Japan has no 
battleships. In the 1904-1905 war with Russia,  
both Japan and Russia had British ships 
because of the alliance that Japan had  
with Britain. Russia also had French ships. So 
if they're able to procure the most advanced  
weaponry from the West, does it matter what 
their level of technological development is? 
You have to learn how to use 
it, and you have to maintain it. 
The Russians had this fancy fleet 
that their aristocrats wanted to buy. 
So they're good at cutting checks, but 
they aren't doing any training on it. 
If you look at the number of days at 
sea for the Russians, it's laughable. 
It's cold, so all winter, no one's going anywhere.
Whereas the Japanese are constantly deploying  
their forces and they're learning, 
doing all kinds of practice and things. 
You can imagine if you don't do any practice, 
it's not going to go very well for you. 
The counterargument to this technology is that if 
the value of the object is high, and if you're an  
intervening power messing in somebody else's 
country, it may not matter on the technology. 
Or it matters, but these 
people will never give up. 
In the American Revolution, the British 
had us on technology. It's incredible. They  
actually could supply, in an age of sail and 
horses, things by sailboats and keep it going. 
But we were just totally obnoxious 
and we would never give up. 
This is the problem with the United States 
in Afghanistan. Talk about a backwards  
place. It doesn't get any more backwards.
Or in Iraq, the locals just never gave up. 
They may not have the technology, but "It's 
our house and we want you out of here.  
We're never quitting." This would 
be Russia's problem in Ukraine.  
It’s going to go on. Technology is 
important, but so is the value of the object. 
What is the relative value of 
whatever you think you win is? 
If you're an Iraqi, it's a lot higher for you 
than it is for some American intervening there. 
If you're looking for Japan and the empire, it's 
a lot higher for Japanese who are looking at China  
and thinking that's going to be their fate.
Maybe they're misidentifying the cure,  
that's a whole different matter.
But that's how they look at it. 
For Russia, it’s, "Who even cares?"
There's nothing this part of the  
world actually offers Russia other than 
more lines on a map that looks bigger. 
Speaking of winning, after the war, as you 
mentioned, Theodore Roosevelt mediates the  
peace treaty between Russia and Japan, and 
he wins the Nobel Peace Prize for this. 
At least one president gets one.
The Treaty of Portsmouth is heavily  
criticized in Japan in the following years for 
not giving them the concessions they feel are  
warranted as a result of their victory.
I don't think there are any reparations. 
There are many territorial disputes that 
don't end up landing in Japan's corner. 
Potentially, a lesson to learn here is 
that if you give too relaxed peace terms,  
then the person who wins will feel 
aggrieved and they'll go at it again. 
Although for the other lesson, you have 
the Treaty of Versailles, where it seems  
like you should learn the opposite lesson.
If you have too aggressive peace terms,  
then the person who lost will come back 
and have this sense of being aggrieved. 
This is a general problem in history.
It feels like there's an equal  
and opposite lesson.
They’re different types  
of wars. One's a war for unlimited objectives, 
which is what World War I eventually becomes. 
We were trying to do regime 
change all over the place. 
Whereas you're doing a limited war for Japan.
You also have to have a feasible objective. 
If Japan had demanded more at those peace 
talks, Nicholas II would have gone back to  
war and he would have slaughtered them 
because he had all these crack troops  
that were just sitting there in the theater.
The Japanese literally don't have the men. 
Russia's got three times the army now.
It's there, and they can bring  
them in at 100,000 a month.
We just saw Mukden where the Russians  
had 125,000 more men than the Japanese.
If they can ship at 100,000 a month,  
wait a few months and it's going to get 
really ugly. It wasn't feasible. There's  
another piece. You're going to go fight 
a war and then you lose a lot of people. 
That's why the Japanese are feeling 
they should have gotten more. 
You've got General Nogi who's 
committing suicide over this. 
The poem at the very beginning I showed you, 
the Meiji Emperor also has this feeling of  
sorrow. With wars you start losing. This is 
Putin's problem. He's lost so many people.  
He didn't feel sorrow, but he needs to get 
revenge that's equivalent to make up for that. 
The longer these wars go on, 
the harder it is to stop them. 
On Versailles, it's a different story because 
there is an unwillingness to enforce the peace. 
There is also a feeling, particularly in 
France and also Britain, to get really  
even with the Germans.
The United States was  
an irresponsible power in those days.
One of the reasons you get World War II  
has to do with the Great Depression, 
which is not strictly related to the  
Versailles peace terms terminating the war.
If you hadn't had the Great Depression,  
maybe the Versailles settlement would have been 
good enough. We'll never know. One of the reasons  
the Great Depression gets so bad is because 
this country doesn't want to act as the lender  
of last resort, which is what Britain had done 
in the past but couldn't after World War I. It  
had been bankrupted. Our country's irresponsible. 
These problems are on the other side of the sea. 
We think, "Okay, America first and whatever," 
and we're going to raise tariffs and things,  
and all we do is tank the global system.
Whereas if you're the lender of last resort,  
you're going to put money into the 
system as it's collapsing to prevent  
it from collapsing so that it can rebound.
That's why it's important to do that. 
It's expensive, but boy, a Great Depression is a 
lot more expensive. There are different problems. 
Is there a lender of last resort today?
Isn't that the problem? That's  
what the IMF and things are about.
But it used to be that this country was  
willing to take on these burdens of last resort 
in the area of nuclear weapons, a nuclear shield. 
We're trying to shed these things right now. 
We shall see. At bare minimum, it'll make us an  
irrelevant power instead of an essential power 
because Europe is going to reorganize itself. 
They have the institutions to do it.
The United States used to be  
the leader of the West.
It's going back home to Europe. 
Europe's going to lead the West. 
They invented it. They have an  
extensive set of institutions to do this.
They're already starting to marginalize  
us by putting out feelers to set up 
trade agreements with Asian countries,  
with South American countries.
It'll take them a while to do this. 
Once they do it, we will be on the outside 
of it if we don't change our minds. 
They're going to get stronger institutionally.
What is it Churchill said something about allies?  
"The only thing worse than working with 
allies is trying to survive without them." 
You're better off with lots of friends going after 
bullies in the world than you are by yourselves.  
We'll find ourselves by ourselves. Other countries 
have tried to tangle with China all by themselves. 
Japan did it when China was an undeveloped 
country. It did not work well. You want  
to have friends when you do this, but we're 
making pivotal errors and we will pay for them. 
Maybe this is a subtle but recurring disagreement 
between us that has come up in different Q&As,  
but I do want to find the crux.
That’s fine. I could be wrong 
It seems like the quality of institutions is 
central in your thinking of how well a country  
will do or how central it will be in the future.
For me, it's much more, "How big is your economy?  
How big is your population?" If you think that the 
center of the Western alliance shifts to Europe,  
maybe you think their institutions 
are good and that's why it'll happen. 
But it seems to me America is just such a 
big and powerful country economically that  
it would be difficult for Europe to displace 
us, even if we make these mistakes in terms of  
our alliances and diplomacy.
Let me ask you a question. 
Why isn't Argentina, which is a really big 
country with tremendous resources, a great power? 
Its economy sucks. I think, 
if its economy was better,  
I think it would be better.
But why does its economy suck? 
Excuse me, not my choice of words.
But that’s a result of mistakes in  
domestic policy with Peronism, not with 
its mistakes in foreign engagement. 
I agree that domestic policies matter a lot.
Okay, but Peron is a populist leader. 
Populists, by definition, aren't 
people who are institutionalists. 
They're like a "Me, I'm so 
special" kind of person. 
Aren't you actually telling me that Argentina has 
inadequate domestic institutions and they failed? 
Agreed. This is great, because then 
we're identifying the real crux. 
Maybe the crux is we both 
agree that institutions matter. 
I think they really matter because they 
shape the trajectory of economic growth. 
Look at Russia. Lousy institutions. 
That place should be rich. 
So I think Europe's institutions 
are still bad because the rate  
of economic growth in Europe is quite bad.
Whereas you think they might be better than I  
think they are, because they're good at diplomacy.
I suspect that this crisis now, because it's  
existential with Putin, will force them 
to clean up these institutions. It will  
take them time. Maybe I'll be dead 
wrong… or maybe I'll be wrong, dead. 
Who knows how that all works?
But I suspect, because usually an  
existential threat is clarifying.
You can see Ukraine trying  
desperately to clean up its institutions.
It has a lot further to go than Europe does. 
I suspect that Europeans are 
going to clean up some of this. 
It'll take them time, but they have to, because 
the piggy bank here is no longer willing to fund  
their defense. So there’s merit. The Europeans 
need to pick up the tab on their defense,  
and they should have done it earlier.
Without a doubt, there's merit to that. 
But the way we're doing it, we're going 
to cut ourselves out of the action. 
You want to put the screws on, but you 
also want to keep yourself part of it. 
We're overdoing it on some fronts.
Also, you're doing it in such an insulting way. 
I'll give you some Machiavelli on this one.
He's the founding father of political science. 
He talked about motivating 
people with fear, love, and hate. 
He's talking about it in The Prince. 
He says, "Forget about love because 
you can't make people like you. 
You can do everything and 
people still don't like you." 
He's a big man in saying, "Make them fear 
you because you can really motivate people,"  
but he says, "Don't make them hate you.
If they hate you, they will fight you." 
If you're running around serially spitting in 
your allies' face, they are going to hate you  
and it won't work out well. It's a bad 
strategy. Don't do it. The clickbait of  
insulting someone who comes to your house, 
that's very temporary, but the hatred of it,  
and also other people viewing it and going, 
"This is what qualifies as American diplomacy?"  
Those memories are long-term. It's unwise.
Are you game for some audience questions? 
Sure.
Anonymous asks— 
Anonymous, brave person.
"What is a good grand strategy for a minor  
power that wants the status quo to continue?
For example, present-day South Korea probably does  
not want China and the US fighting over Taiwan."
Its allies and alliance systems. Smaller powers  
have been tremendously influential in the 
rules-based order, on how it's developed. 
They've provided some of the 
really good ideas over the years. 
It's "cooperate" because if you have allies… 
This is what the United States doesn't get. 
We're big, but if we're going after 
everybody else, they're bigger. 
If you're small… This is how Europe is important.
There are a lot of small countries or medium  
countries, but when they get 
together, they get powerful. 
When they add in Japan, they 
get the equivalent GNP of us. 
Then you start adding other 
people in and they're bigger. 
Yes, it takes a long time to negotiate whatever 
the agreement is going to be, but once you agree,  
it's powerful. That's the answer. This is how 
we have as much of a rules-based order as we do,  
which allows everyone in the audience to take 
a little piece of plastic called a credit card,  
go to any country in the world, pretty 
much—I wouldn't go to North Korea,  
but most countries—and you use that credit card.
If it says you have enough money to buy a Mercedes  
and there's a Mercedes in the shop, the 
chances are the credit card will go through  
and you can buy your Mercedes.
It's just a piece of plastic. 
This is the rules-based order 
that most of us are into. 
It's because we agree with 
each other on these things. 
Denny Trimcev asks, "What made Japan a more 
fertile ground for Western ideas than China? 
Was China just too big for meaningful 
institutional change in the same time scale?" 
This is my guess because who knows?
China is suffering from the  
incredible success of its civilization.
It had been the dominant civilization of  
Asia forever and ever for excellent reasons.
If you look at the achievements of China,  
they're amazing.
For Japan, it had always been in China's shadow. 
The Japanese had always 
tried to learn from others. 
The Chinese also learned from others.
A lot of their institutions come from the  
Manchus, but they pretend that, "We sinify 
these people," and so they're actually Han  
Chinese achievements. Not so much, actually. The 
myth lives on that anything that's worth knowing  
emanates from China. Hubris. This is a human 
condition, and the Chinese get a fatal case. 
What I'm wondering about is whether this 
country has got a fatal case right now.  
"We know everything. We can do everything."
This leads in very nicely to the next question. 
Lydia Dean asks, "In the spirit of the 
Meiji delegates sending out to explicitly  
study the West, where would the United 
States do well to send delegates today?" 
Delegates today? Our allies. Start 
by apologizing to them. That would  
be step one. I can't see that ever happening.
We have all these international organizations.  
Use them. We're in the process 
of firing the State Department. 
I believe when WikiLeaks leaked a lot of 
their memos and things and the New York  
Times was reporting on it, what it revealed was 
incredibly accurate reporting of whatever place  
they were assigned to, and describing things 
in really accurate detail that would enable  
US policymakers then to make an accurate 
assessment and determine to do what's next. 
But that's not what we're doing.
This is actually a very interesting  
take you gave to me offline once about the 
WikiLeaks leaks of the State Department documents. 
You were like, "Oh, wow, they're kind 
of on it. These seem like good memos." 
I technically wasn't allowed 
to read them because they were  
classified and I was working for the Navy.
So I didn't go out of my way to read them. 
But I'm reading the New York Times and 
other things that are reporting on them. 
From what's there, you just see that it's 
accurate and it's in-depth reporting. 
Of course, we're angry that 
they're all out there because  
it's revealing who's talking to whom and whatever.
But what it showed is a very professional staff. 
I don't know why we got some axe to grind with 
the State Department. It's also really tiny.  
Working at the War College on student solutions 
to the world's problems, they would always say  
quadruple the State Department's budget because 
it's really tiny compared to the military budget. 
There's an understanding that what much of 
the US government does, if it's doing what  
it's supposed to, is it's preventing catastrophes.
If you're sending your State Department out there,  
you're trying to prevent an 
Indo-Pakistani nuclear war. 
We've sent diplomats at different 
times to prevent that from happening. 
Who knows why it didn't happen?
Maybe it wasn't the State Department. 
But all over the world trying 
to prevent these things… 
If you think about the government, it's about 
setting all these standards to prevent disasters. 
I’ve talked to you offline so this 
must be repetitive for you but,  
you immunize people to prevent disease.
Can I prove who didn't get what? No,  
I can't. I can talk about people 
who got bad reactions to it. 
But then there's a failure to understand.
There are some bad reactions, but let's  
look at the much greater number of 
people who are alive in our own day. 
Earlier, when Roosevelt was 
president, Roosevelt had polio,  
and people were scared to death of getting polio.
They understood the importance of these things. 
Everyone was lining up to get the polio vaccine 
when Dr. Salk invented it. There are other things,  
like having enough meteorologists to predict 
storms so you can get people out of summer camps  
when you need to get the people out of summer 
camps, having appropriate spending of government  
funds to have the appropriate sirens and things.
People are looking at the expense of doing these  
things but they're preventing disasters. 
It's the negative objectives. You can't  
measure the things that fail to happen.
But I assure you, by averting a catastrophe  
you're saving a lot, probably a lot more 
than whatever you're spending on the budget. 
The US government needs to be 
much more efficient. I get it. But  
tearing the whole place down is going to be 
a mistake, and we will get more catastrophes. 
Alright, next month we're doing a 
podcast with you and Elon together. 
Oh, Elon. Oh, lucky me. 
That's a whole other thing. 
Maybe we should save that for the next lecture.
The different varieties of American hubris. 
Welcome to San Francisco, Sarah.
One variant of hubris A is, I'm an American. 
I don't need to consult any other country.
It's just whatever Washington does or doesn't do. 
That determines how the world works. It's 
half-court tennis. It ignores what the other  
team's doing, and it doesn't work out well.
Then there's Silicon Valley,  
or whatever it is, a different variant.
It's what I call Type 2 hubris. "I'm  
incredibly talented in one area" which he 
is, he’s incredibly talented or whatever. 
He's made himself a household word. Not 
everyone can do that. But you're thinking,  
"Because I'm good at one thing, this is 
transferable to everything else." I got news.  
There's all kinds of expertise and it's important.
But if I take a really good hairdresser and make  
them an auto mechanic, or the auto mechanic a 
hairdresser, it is not going to work out well. 
You have to line these things up correctly.
This type 2 hubris is thinking, "I'm smart at  
one thing, and therefore I can do everything."
These people are making decisions in areas  
where they have no expertise, 
and it will not work out well. 
Great place to close.
Yes.
