What I love about technology
is that it can help us do things
that we could have never imagined.
For instance, I grew up
in a rural part of India.
I didn't grow up in the city.
I didn't come from an affluent family.
In fact, we didn't have a computer
when I was growing up.
My middle school and high school
had one computer
that the entire school shared.
I got access to 10 minutes a week,
maybe 20 minutes max,
for me to actually use a computer.
That means I got to make
every second count,
and every second was precious
because I wanted to learn how to program.
With only 10 minutes to go,
it wasn't an obvious choice
or an easy one.
I didn't have all day to try out my code.
In fact, I had to be a human compiler
to detect these syntax
errors ahead of time.
I fell in love with this problem solving
that came with this
and went on to actually study
in the top college in my state,
College of Engineering, Guindy,
and was the first generation
in my family to go to college.
Eventually, I went out to get a PhD
in Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.
One funny anecdote, at my university,
you had to have two people
standing by your side
while you are defending your thesis.
In case the defense kept going on and on,
someone needs to stand in
if you need a break.
Here in this picture,
I asked my brother to be one of them.
He knew almost nothing
about my PhD dissertation
and was terrified that I would
step away as a joke,
but I didn't.
Eventually, I got a job at Amazon.
You've got to remember,
this was 20 years ago.
And during that time,
and I was, actually I distinctly remember,
calling my mom and telling her,
saying, like, "Mom,
I got a job in Amazon."
And I still remember my mom's
reaction when I told her.
She was certain I was going
to waste my time, PhD,
by joining an internet book company,
because that's what
Amazon was at that time.
But at Amazon,
I got an opportunity
to build amazing things.
And what became eventually AWS.
And I got to build
technologies like DynamoDB,
SageMaker and Bedrock,
which are the underpinnings of many
of the modern applications we use today.
And now, if I look back,
it all started with the 10 minutes
of access I had to that computer
that wasn't even mine.
It opened up worlds to me
that I could have never thought
that was possible.
And now, as the VP of agentic AI at AWS,
when I think about how agents
are going to transform everything,
I can't help but be optimistic.
Today, I’m going to talk
to you about AI agents,
what I think will be one of the most
transformative technology shifts
of our time.
And we will talk about what they are
and what are the milestones
they need to achieve
before we can trust them
and make it an integral part
of our daily lives.
And also talk about how
they will change everything.
So first, what are AI agents?
AI agents are these autonomous
software systems
that leverage AI to reason.
They plan and they adapt
in pursuit of user-defined goals.
They complete tasks on your behalf
of humans or other systems.
These AI agents can sense and interact
with their digital environment,
converting these high-level objectives
into executable steps.
And constantly they learn and improve
their efficiency over time.
Today, agents are being used
for everything,
right from software development
to drug discovery
to precision agriculture to many more.
Their ability to use and manipulate
interfaces in their digital environment,
the same way we as humans do,
dramatically lowers the bar for use cases
like building applications.
You no longer need rigid
application specifications
and then break it down
into complex software projects.
Now you have the possibility
to just state your goal
and let the AI agents figure it out.
But not everything is an agent.
For example, imagine
you are a researcher in a lab.
You're sitting down at your computer
and tell the AI that you want
to run some experiments
to explore a new protein.
It responds telling you
something like, "Great,
let me actually propose the six
experiments you can run."
Now that's not an agent, that's a chatbot.
But with agents,
what you get is when you give them a goal,
they can plan.
They can write code,
they can use the tools
to build the experiment for you.
They will synthesize your results,
and they will reflect on failures.
And they will look for ways to constantly
improve their efficiency over time.
The work that you might take
for a week or more to research
and build the plans for these experiments
can now be done in hours or even minutes.
Your role now becomes
more of a trusted advisor,
where you are steering these AI agents
towards actually execution
and, in many ways, like peer
reviewing a colleague’s book.
With AI agents, the barriers
to creating something will now lower.
Challenges, like,
I don't have a particular skill,
or I don't have enough resources
or headcount to do this project
are going to start to go away.
The future we will share
will be shaped by those
with the ability to think big
and even dream bigger.
But we are not there yet.
In fact, there are three milestones
these AI agents need to achieve
before they fundamentally change
how we work and how we live.
The first is how we build software.
So much of our world is digital.
In fact, in this room alone,
on all the devices you have in this room,
there are probably hundreds
of applications, if not more.
In our daily lives, on a constant basis,
we carry the works of tens
of thousands of software developers,
if not more than, like, hundreds
or thousands of software developers.
So now, when you think about it,
for AI agents,
before they can even reach the masses,
they need to reach builders.
And that means,
if they are going to survive,
those builders need to find the agents
to be useful and interesting.
This goes beyond the tools that these
developers use on a daily basis.
They are already becoming agentic,
but what needs to change
is how easy are these agents to build.
The bigger shift is in changing
how we conceptualize
effective agent architectures.
Now take a look at this problem
of how software developers
or builders build applications.
Today, as developers,
they have a bunch
of choices they have to make
as they are building these applications.
Many of these are implementation details,
like which server
or which compute option
do I need to choose
for hosting this website
or building this mobile app?
If you have never had to make this choice,
there are a lot of options to decide,
like, how to host your website
or application in the cloud.
For example, in AWS for a builder,
if they want to host
a mobile app or website,
in one of our services called EC2,
we offer something like
850 compute options
for them to choose from,
and that is not even one compute option.
There are even more.
And now, as we move
towards the agentic era,
developers will be able
to shift their focus
into what they are building
instead of worrying
about how they are building.
That means decisions
like which compute to choose
become less relevant.
In fact, AI agents are going
to automatically enable us
to pick those things for you.
Now the next milestones
agents are going to reach,
and they must reach, is trust.
Without trust,
none of these capabilities of agents
are going to really matter.
But how can you trust an agent?
The reality is that we are still
in very early days of agentic AI.
We know agents are imperfect,
and they will make mistakes.
Yet even in simple tasks,
we have an uncompromising
need for perfection.
The good news is that agents are not
reaching into some magical ether
to make things happen.
The systems, tools and the environments
that these AI agents are using
have well-understood
specifications on how they work
and what they should be doing,
so they can actually
be mathematically proved
if a system or program obeys
its application specifications
the way they are intended to.
And this technique is called
automated reasoning.
Automated reasoning
is a field of computer science
that attempts to provide assurance
if a system is behaving
exactly as it is expected,
based on sound mathematical logic.
Its roots go all the way back
to ancient Greece,
where Aristotle was the first logician
to attempt a systematic analysis
of logical syntax.
Today, automated reasoning
is the algorithmic search for proofs
in mathematical logic,
and can be used to make sure
that the agentic reasoning is accurate.
To do this, you need to know
precisely what each agent can do.
So now let's take a look
at a very small example.
At AWS, one of the first agents
we built was called Amazon Q.
Among other things, Q was built
to help software developers
build software applications.
We were really excited.
We were already imagining all
the amazing possibilities Q can do,
even in its prototype,
because it was going to be as smart
and capable as our best
software developers.
We thought it's going
to accelerate our road map
and obliterate all our backlogs.
But there was a problem.
The first prototype we built
was more like me
when I was an intern in Amazon.
They were eager and error-prone.
They were hallucinating API calls.
We had to fix it.
So how did we go about it?
We formalized all the API specs
into mathematical model
so that every time Q
generates an API request,
an automated reasoning solver
first verifies saying like,
"Is this a valid request?"
If the solver finds an error,
it communicates back
to the agent saying like,
"Hey, I think you got it wrong this way.
Can you now restructure your code?"
So now it gets fixed
even before requiring human intervention.
This back-and-forth communication
creates what I call
as a neurosymbolic feedback loop
that is completely transparent
and enables us to mathematically prove
that the action an agent can take
is going to be correct
even before it is taken.
And it does it faster than you can blink:
100 microseconds or less
for 95 percent of use cases.
Now, this is just a small start,
but we believe combining agentic AI
and automated reasoning
will help agents become trustworthy
to reach widespread adoption.
Now, if we stopped here,
we would have an incredible
developer experience
where every software
developer in the world
can build amazing, trustworthy agents.
But agents can't change everything
if it only targets a small
subset of population.
Across businesses,
there are wide variety of people
and most have never written
a single line of code.
The final milestone is to enable
anyone to build agents.
Here is an example.
Imagine if you only had two minutes
to recap everything you heard
in the TED conference today
and now you had to summarize it.
For many of you thinking,
"You know what, I'm going to just talk
really, really fast and I can do it."
That's not going to cut it
if I tell you you have to use
the clips that you saw today
to create your two-minute summary.
How long do you think it will take you
to create this perfect two-minute story?
Now that is the exact problem we faced
in our Amazon Prime Video,
where an effective recap
of a Prime Video series
can take weeks to produce
and is very expensive
because everything,
from creating the story arc
to selecting scenes, is manual.
Cinematography experts
are not usually the master coders,
but we introduce agents
to help streamline the process,
breaking the workflow into three phases:
observation, reasoning and action.
Now, in our first phase,
what we call as observation,
we ask AI agents to understand
what's happening in the video.
They need to produce a rich
and detailed observation and understanding
about every aspect of the shot,
scene and the entire story,
so that we can define a story arc
and select the right scenes.
Then we move to the second phase,
what we call as reasoning.
Here, what we can imagine
is the agents are saying, like,
"With what I know, what do I need to do?"
Reasoning layers on top of observation.
So for example,
we want to generate
a voice-over narrative for recaps.
We can ask the reasoning agent
to generate the script
by collaborating
with the observation agent.
Then, the final step
is what we call as action.
In this phase,
now what you are bringing in
are the trusted experts
who are going to work with these AI agents
to help finally recap the story.
Now, if you go back
to your two-minute TED recap,
how much easier would it be
for you with this task
if you had these powerful AI agents?
The power of human and agent collaboration
is that it frees us up
from being bogged on
by the drudge work,
and enables us to do these amazing things
and creating things
based on exactly what we love.
But in Prime Video,
they were using agents.
So how do we get to a place
where anyone can build agents?
In fact, the frameworks to build agents
are already getting simplified day by day.
Any application developer
who knows how to write a code in Python
can now build a pretty
useful agent already.
And now we are also starting
to see, like, not just from AWS,
but everywhere around,
we are building these agentic
cloud infrastructure
that makes it super easy
to go from proof
of concepts to production.
But those alone are not enough.
We need to expand the pool
of people who can build AI agents.
To get there, the interfaces
to build agents must become familiar
to business users as well.
The way we think about building
and training agents must also change.
Smarter models are great,
but a world-class scholar
that doesn't take any action
or that is ignorant to the way
we do things, isn't helpful.
We need agents that are ready
for the real world.
We will need to create worlds
for agents to play with
and to improve the next
generation of digital twin.
And once we are done
[with] all of that, what happens?
If we get it right,
these agents will become invisible,
but they will help us
do incredible things.
In the next few years,
we will see agents that give rise
to more companies faster than ever,
where success is determined by your ideas
and your ability to describe
what you want to build.
We will see more medical breakthroughs,
and you are going to see
way more discoveries.
And with all of this,
what makes me so optimistic
is that the future
we will have with agents
will be ultimately built by you.
Your 10 minutes are coming.
What will you build?
(Applause)
