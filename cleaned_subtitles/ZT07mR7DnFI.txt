how much information can a black hole store ah okay well as much information that's a great question that has been a very productive line of thought and uh the answer to that question goes back to uh Hawking and and Penrose um so you could even ask another question which is how much information can anything store so actually can we back up what why do we like it is actually notable that this is a question we ask of black holes in particular like do how often do we ask like how much information in the sun store uh uh like why why in particular are we interested in how much information in Black HW store well it turns out that that's been an incredibly productive line of thought A and B it also turns out that that is the the main fact that we're most confident about about quantum gravity so the two great theories of 20th century physics gravity Einstein's theory of the curvature of space time and gravity and all the rest the very tends to make itself felt at the very large scale and on the other hand quantum mechanics the theory of the very small to do with Heisenberg and principles an atom and atomic Spectra uh tends to make itself seen at the very small scale these are the two most beautiful theories of 20th century physics the two things that we should be most proud about that we discovered in the early 20th century and it was noticed pretty early on that these two theories seem to be inconsistent with each other the the the most obvious ways to try and reconcile quantum mechanics and gravity break uh they don't you can't really shove them together and uh this is a problem if you think that the world should be comprehensible that there should be some theory that in fact is consistent that describes the world so this has been a big project in theoretical physics over the last uh few decades is trying to understand how we can take Einstein's general relativity and quantum mechanics and make them meld together in a mathematically and physically consistent manner the It's tricky in part because there's very little experimental guidance because generativity tends to make itself felt at large scales quantum mechanics at small scales and so trying to find a place where they meet in the middle and it must be that they do meet but that trying to drag that out with experiment is very tricky but this has been a big project is trying to figure out how to do this Einstein spent some years unsuccessfully doing this in the later less productive part of his career and uh this project of trying to unite these is something that a lot of people have thought a lot about the String Theory comes out of this uh this project a number of other lines of thought there is however one fact about that merger that we are most confident about about anything about the merger and that exactly returns to this question of how much information can you store in a given region of SpaceTime um and in fact how much region and the answer to that involves black holes so uh the answer uh is how much if you have a region of of a certain area uh maybe a sphere of a certain area and you said how much information can you store in that region the amount of information you can store measured in bits the entropy of that region is given by the area uh of that region divided by uh G Newton's constant and H bar Plank's constant so that's how you know that this is something to do with quantum gravity because it involves both G uh and H bar is is that the only situation in physics where we both of those end up be both of those constants end up being in the same place that is not the only situation no anytime you have quantum gravity they'll tend to be in the same place and sometimes even when you don't have quantum gravity but you have the interplay of gravitational forces and Quantum degeneracy pressures uh those will ALS so that'll end up in those but it's in some sense the simplest uh situation in which it occurs which is why so much time has been thinking spent thinking about thought experiments to do with black holes so the there was a physicist called beckenstein who figured out that that that should be the answer at the area divided by GH bar and then Hawking's great contribution to physics was figuring out that it was the area divided by GH bar but he also got the prefactor and the preactor was a quarter so this is this is you know alling figured out that it's a quarter at the area divided by four GH bar um and this is a super interesting answer um how much information can you store in a given region is given by the area and in fact black holes maximize that black holes store that amount of information in a given area but but and specifically area meaning surface area meaning surface area exactly so the reason that that's such a wild answer and an answer that's led to all sorts of thought experiments to do with with uh quantum gravity ever since then is that you might naively think that the amount of information you can store in a region is given not by its surface area but by its volume so if I have a hard drive and I take another hard drive and another hard drive and another hard drive and I keep piling them up the amount of information I can store on those hard drives scales like the number of those hard drives and that means it scales like the volume of the region in which I'm in the hard drives that everything we know about classical you know classic thermodynamics tells us that that the amount of information should scale like the volume everything we know about non-gravitational physics tends to tell us to point in the direction of the amount of information you can store goes like the volume and yet this is like the most surprising fact that that is incredibly generative is that in once you combine once you add gravity to the picture once you combine quantum mechanics and gravity the the amount of information you can store in a given region a given sphere goes like the surface area of that region not like the volume of that region and and you might think that that's um you might think that that can't possibly be right um and and you might give the following argument okay so there's some uh there's some region and I'm just going to keep adding more and more hard drives to that region and as I make uh that region bigger and bigger and bigger uh the amount of information on those hard drives goes like the number of those hard drives it goes like the radius of that region cubed and the thing about the radius of the region cubed is it grows faster at large radius than the radius of that region squared so I just told you that the amount of information you can store in a region is given by the the surface area and yet I also gave you a way to make it scale like the volume So eventually if I make the region big enough the amount of information in that uh in that volume will break will be bigger than the bound that I just said therefore I've ruled out Hawkings and Penrose and beckon scen bound uh what goes wrong with that thought experiment uh is that eventually if I make a big enough pile of hard drives the whole pile of hard drives will undergo gravitational collapse and form a black hole actually um but then there has to be sort of an experiment not experimental but a sort of um do you have to C the numbers then to determine that just before the pile of hard drives would collapse into a black hole the the amount of information stored in that cubic pile of hard drives is less than the um amount of information that then gets turned into the the surface area of the black hole because I theoretically it's POS if I don't know if I'm like get my math insts right right it's like theoretically possible that like even though the black hole is smaller because it's only the surface area the cubic ends up being bigger yeah you can you have to run that calculation um but if you do run the calculation it turns out that it's nowhere near when it's it wasn't close the the the uh not one of the things where they just balance each other they don't just balance each other out if I take a you know an online shopping website and I buy a bunch of wi and Digital hard drives and I calculate the information storage capacity of those and compare it to uh the the area of a black hole you know I figure out when the pressure in the hard drive will be enough to stop it for collapsing to form a black hole uh it is nowhere close it will make a black hole way way way before it comes close to violating beckenstein Hawking pound got it okay sorry didn't and then you um oh yeah so that's the information storage in black holes the reason you know that that's also the information storage Bound for Anything not just black holes is that if you had something that wasn't a black hole that had more information than that in a given region and you just added matter eventually that that thing itself would collapse to form a black hole and so it couldn't it couldn't be the case just logically that that had more information and the black hole it'll it'll tend to you just hinted at the idea that um somehow this is like the most ractive line of thought that physics has come up with in the last few decades um why is that why why is the fact that the area is proportional to the information of a black hole tell us so much about the universe it's been extremely important for our understanding of quantum gravity it's perhaps the central fact that we know about quantum gravity is that the information is scales with the area and that is a hint you know that fact that was known since the 70s was a big hint that became uh very influential later on um at the as understood by Beck and SC Hawking it's just a weird fact about black holes perhaps but we Now understand it as uh a strong indication of what we call the holographic principle the holographic principle um has been a sort of powerful idea uh in quantum gravity and and it's the following so if you took a non-gravitational system you know like in which you ignored gravity like the pile of hard drives the information storage would scale like the the volume as we discussed whereas in fact it scales like the area so or another way to say that is if you take a three-dimensional 3+1 dimensional uh theory in which you have both quantum mechanics and gravity that uh the information scor scales like R squ rather than R cubed I.E it scales as though you had a non-gravitational system in one fewer Dimension so if you had a two-dimensional theory in which there was no gravity the information stored in a given region would also scale like r s because the information would be just the two-dimensional volume as in as in the area so in other words it's at least as far as information density the information capacity is concerned a gravitational theory in three dimensions is like a non-gravitational theory in two Dimensions or more generally a gravitational theory in N Dimensions is like a non-gravitational theory in 2 minus one in N minus one Dimensions so that that is a big hint that forms the basis of the holographic principle it's like gravity eats information like there's there's less information than you thought there was you naively thought there was if you didn't include information and so the holographic principle says that maybe that's not just a a neat observation maybe it in fact is the case that a for every or for for some Quantum gravitational theories there is another theory that is exactly equivalent to it in one fewer Dimension and so this led to mala's ads CFT correspondence the G gravity Duality which was the most cited paper in heni theoretical physics uh ever I think maybe at this stage uh and in the late ' 90s he wrote down he didn't he took that as a hint and it wrote down an exact we believe an exact Duality between a particular theory of quantum gravity some particular flavor of string theory and a non-gravitational theory that lives on lives on the boundary of that space and what problem does it solve if you can model the world in a fewer Dimension that doesn't involve gravity well it's so this was a very influential paper as I said um and really becomes a tremendous theoretical laboratory for trying to understand the connection between gravity and quantum mechanics one problem it solves is gravity is mysterious particularly once we inove quantum mechanics in various ways uh that we could go into um you know this is why it's hard to quantize gravity but if you can say that this theory of of that involves both quantum mechanics and gravity is exactly jewel is is in some sense the same Theory yeah as just an alternative description of a theory in one fewer Dimensions that doesn't involve gravity well that's great because we have much better grass on how to understand theories that don't have gravity than we do on theories that do have gravity so it puts everything on a much clearer footing uh to to have this non-gravitational description because then you can just use the standard tools of non-gravitational Quant field theory in order to Define it and understand it so at one level I understand that if the information on in a area is limited by the information that would be on the surface of a black hole in that region um then yeah there the you can model the surface area as a two two-dimensional object um on the other hand if I just think about like real world it's just like you're over there and I'm over here and if I like do something here it's not interacting with you and in order to model that fact I need to model the dimension in which the third dimension in which we're separated um which I guess if I'm like actually looking at you through a window pane I maybe wouldn't have access to so and I so how in two Dimensions how do you model how like that there's a reason we have the third dimension right and how is that how is that modeled if you reduce that Dimension yeah so I maybe I should just lead with some disappointing news which is that ads CFT was in tremendous conceptual breakthrough in our understanding of quantum gravity and and embodied the holographic principle but at the same time it doesn't describe our universe in particular in ads CFT there is a negative cosmological constant in in the gravitational Theory and our universe as we discussed before has a positive cosmal constant so it's great because it provides an existence proof of a a well-defined theory of quantum gravity not alas in the universe in which we live in okay but having said that yeah it's extremely confusing and was uh a very impressive result precisely because you might think how could it possibly be the case that two different theories and two different dimensions uh could turn out to be equivalent and the answer to your question is if you have two people who are living in this this negatively curved space in and talking to each other what does that look like in this other Theory I say that there's some you know there's this process going on in the gravitational Theory that's Jewel which is in exactly isomorphic to some process going on in the non-gravitational theory in one fewer Dimensions but what what maybe looks very simple in one Theory like you and I chatting back and forth to each other would look like some complicated plasma physics in in the uh lower dimensional boundary Theory and so that the sort of complexity of how it looks like which is a better description does not need to be conserved across the isomorphism so in fact that's often what we use it for we use it to do Arbitrage between things that look simple in one Theory and things that look simple in the alternative description and we use we use the fact that things look simple in one to understand the sort of complicated version in the other in fact that it flows in both directions you might naively expect that because gravity is so complicated we would always be using the non-gravitational theory to understand the gravitational Theory that's not always true there are these plasma physics is itself extremely complicated and there are these big uh collisions that we do at at Rick in in Brook Haven where we smash two gold atoms together and make big Fireballs of quar glan plasma and it's extremely challenging to calculate what would happen there and yet people use this this duality in the opposite direction to say even though it looks super complicated with this weird plasma physics in the non-gravitational theory it's actually can simply be understood as some simple black hole property in the gravitational Theory um would any maybe not ads CFT itself but would some Theory which relies on the holographic principle ever be able to account for a world like ours where unlike the surface of a black hole there isn't a boundary because of the posit positive cosmological constant and it's constantly expanding is there some hope that there in fact is a way to have some sort of dual Theory to this that somehow describes a boundary or yeah I people are working on that that is an open area of research ever since the original ads CF was written down people have been trying to formulate versions of it in which have a positive C marcial constant um it's difficult and part of the difficulty is goes all the way back to Archimedes you know you you need a it is easiest to formulate a theory if you have a fixed point on which to stand and observe things from a distance in in a universe with a pos positive cosmal constant that you don't have that you don't have that you're necessarily mixed up with the system because you live in a universe that has only a finite amount of entropy finite amount of free energy uh there is an inherent limitation to the Precision of the experiments you can do that just makes things way trickier so for that and related reasons it's a much harder project but for sure people are working on that what is the correct conceptual way to think about this cuz one version is the boundary uh is um one way to simplify the processes that are actually four-dimensional um another is I don't know how we think about this in the context of black holes but maybe in the context of black holes no the information actually is on the horizon the analogous thing here would be like no somehow we are on the boundary of the universe somehow um is there a sense in which one of these interpretations is correct ah yeah okay that's a good question so um this Duality idea where you have two different descriptions of the same thing is not the adsf was not the first such example in physics it's it's a common Trope in physics that you can have two different descriptions of the same thing some of which are more useful in one scenario some of which are more useful in the other scenario but but which are both exactly correct and there are non-gravitational examples in physics that go back a long way you may then ask you know which one is right and which one is not right uh is is it actually a CFT that's pretending to be you know that has this weird alternative description of as a a as a gravitational Theory or is the gravitational Theory correct and the other one's not correct I think this is more of a philosophical question my answer would be is if the if the isomorphism was just an approximation like it was really one thing and you were just pretending it was the other thing and that approximation worked in some region of validity and not others then I would say that the the one was right and the other one was just a alternative fanciful description that is not our understanding of ads CFT as we understand it today our understanding is that this is a precise isomorphism it's not a analogy it's not a metaphor it is not a approximation that is valid in some domain and not another it really is the case that these two theories are exactly equivalent to each other and if that's correct then as a matter of philosophy I would say those are both equally real those so there it's not the case that one is more real than the other they're perfect simulations of each other um yeah are you an ads dreaming you're a CFT or a CFT dreaming you're an ads I think I think these I think these are just two completely different inequivalent descriptions of the same identical physics tell me if this is just like a question that just doesn't make sense because look I uh when I was like uh when I if you try to ask somebody about like uh the quantum manyu worlds um uh where are the other worlds right and they like oh it's just like they're in Hilbert space like where is Hilbert's space they're just like no dude it's just like a conceptual like you don't you know just like stop asking questions um intuitively it feels like there should be a sense in which like there is some physical existence and either that existence is in this four-dimensional space or it's in some space that exists on the boundary um is this just again just going to lead us into philosophical Loops or is there something that can be said more about it and also in a de in a world like ours um what exactly would the boundary mean yeah so there are two components to that question you have an intuition that if something is real it needs to be spatially localized and things that are delocalized in space somehow can't be real I would say that that's not my intuition my intuition is that there can be two completely different descriptions of the same physics and if it's precise neither of those is any more real than the other things do not need to be specially localized um you separately asked what would it look like what would a version of uh where is the boundary theory in c space since there's no boundary that is a great question that people who are trying to generalize ads CFT to to a universe like ours that has a positive scal constant that they wrestle with and there's more than one proposal some of which is that the place one example of a proposal is that the jeel theory should live on the cosmic Horizon so there's a you if you go five billion light years you can send information to that that point and have it return to you but on the other hand there are things that are 100 billion light years away that we'll we'll never be able to communicate with and there's a boundary between those two between some things that we could in principle communicate with and things that we couldn't in principle communicate with that is the cosmological Horizon and some people who are trying to do a version of holography that works in universes with the cosmal Positive cosmal constant like to put the the second theory there other people like to put it in the distant future in the sort of infinitely distant future and and that's part of the problem is where do we even put that theory it's not like in these it's not like in our universe where you can just put it spatially infinitely far away and and be done with it if it's spatially finite then we are currently at the boundary of infinite many other universes that are located uh or whose Center is located elsewhere absolutely so a cosmological horizon is very different from a black hole Horizon in this regard a black hole Horizon there is a point of no return and if you get closer than that you fall into the black hole you never getting out again uh and it's everybody can agree where that is um for cosmology the there is a point of no return but there's no but the point of no return is return to a given person and so for each person there is a different point of no return and as you say we live on the boundary just as much as we live on the boundary of those people live on our cosmological Horizon we may live on on theirs
