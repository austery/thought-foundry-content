In India’s stock market, the tail wags the 
dog. Derivatives trading doesn’t just rival  
cash equities, it dwarfs it. Derivatives 
turnover is more than 300 times higher than  
cash equities turnover. This inversion, driven 
by an army of options-hungry retail traders,  
is unmatched anywhere else in the world.
This imbalance created a market where  
expiry-day price movements could be dramatically 
influenced by a handful of well-timed trades,  
and where retail investors—often trading with 
100 times leverage—make wild bets. In a market  
like this, speed, scale, and precision are highly 
rewarded, so for sophisticated trading firms like  
Jane Street, Indian options trading has been a 
goldmine, netting the firm more than four billion  
dollars in profits over the last two years. 
Until it wasn’t.
 
Last week, India’s financial regulator - The 
Securities and Exchange Board of India (known  
as SEBI) - accused Jane Street - a global quant 
trading firm that uses technology and quantitative  
analysis to trade - of exploiting this structural 
quirk to orchestrate – what they describe as a  
“sinister scheme” of index manipulation. 
India's securities regulator banned the  
firm from the country’s markets and ordered it to 
return more than $550 million dollars in alleged  
illegal gains. Jane Street denies these 
charges - and insists that it was merely  
engaging in standard arbitrage trades.
The case has not just exposed Jane Streets  
trading strategy - it has laid bare the fragility 
of a market where derivatives dominate, retail  
investors gamble wildly, and the line between 
arbitrage and manipulation is dangerously thin.
 
It was not always this way in India. For much of 
the 2000s and early 2010s, India’s stock markets  
were considered unattractive by fast paced 
traders. The combination of high transaction  
costs, regulatory restrictions, and infrastructure 
limitations kept many global quant firms at bay.
 
The most significant deterrent was the Securities 
Transaction Tax (STT), a levy on every trade,  
regardless of profit or loss. While small in 
percentage terms this tax added up quickly for  
strategies that relied on thousands of intraday 
trades. Foreign portfolio investors also faced  
restrictions on intraday short selling, limiting 
their ability to run long/short or market-neutral  
strategies. Meanwhile, access to leverage was 
tightly controlled, and co-location services  
lagged behind global standards.
Because of this, India’s markets  
were dominated by traditional brokers, 
long-only funds, and retail investors.
 
This all began to change in the late 2010s when 
the National Stock Exchange began upgrading its  
infrastructure, offering better APIs and 
co-location services. Regulatory reforms  
allowed more flexibility in derivatives 
trading, especially for foreign portfolio  
investors operating through locally incorporated 
entities. And most importantly, the explosion of  
retail participation—fueled by mobile trading 
apps, zero-commission brokers, and pandemic-era  
boredom—transformed India’s derivatives market 
into a high-volume, high-volatility playground.
 
India's stock market went from being a sleepy 
backwater to the epicenter of a global derivatives  
frenzy. While Wall Street still dominates 
in equities and bonds - Mumbai’s National  
Stock Exchange leads the world in options trading 
volumes. In 2024, India accounted for a staggering  
89% of global equity options volume, according 
to the Futures Industry Association—surpassing  
even the S&P 500 in daily notional turnover.
This explosion has been fueled by - a surging  
retail investor base - the rise 
of discount brokerages in India,  
and the introduction of zero-day to expiration 
options. These are options contracts that expire  
the same day they are created and have quickly 
become the hottest ticket in Indian finance,  
offering the promise of quick profits with minimal 
capital. For many young Indians, trading options  
has become a form of financial entertainment. 
Unfortunately, it’s not going that well for them…  
India’s securities regulator reported earlier 
this year that nine out of ten Indian retail  
traders are losing money in the market – as it 
unveiled plans to raise barriers to trading and  
temporarily ban some prominent “finfluencers” that 
young people looked up to for financial advice.

Over the last 5 to 10 years, the Indian stock 
market has shown strong and consistent growth,  
outperforming many global and emerging markets. 
Not even America’s S&P 500, - home to seven  
of the world’s eight trillion-dollar 
companies, has managed to keep pace.
 
That outperformance has turned the country’s 
stocks into a favorite with global investors,  
who have been shunning Chinese 
equities amid a domestic slowdown  
and geopolitical tensions with the US.
Despite this massive performance,  
Individual investors in India have managed 
to suffer significant losses through their  
trading. According to a SEBI study released 
this Monday, mom-and-pop traders lost a  
combined thirty three billion dollars over the 
last four years—despite the huge uptrend and  
repeated warnings from regulators about the 
high risks of competing with better-funded  
and more experienced market players.
The Economist points out that the sudden  
explosion in derivatives trading in India 
has many parallels with America’s meme-stock  
craze – which still hasn’t ended. The Covid 
lockdowns five years ago – according to the  
Economist - spawned a generation in India 
who turned to day-trading to escape boredom.
 
The numbers are dizzying. The notional value 
of index options traded on the NSE more than  
doubled in the last year alone to $907 
trillion dollars. The number of investor  
accounts has tripled over the last five years 
to over 160 million. Mutual fund assets under  
management have doubled to $706 billion. 
It’s not just money that has been lost either,  
two years ago a 26-year-old software analyst 
jumped from his office building in Chennai  
after taking out a twelve-thousand-dollar 
bank loan and losing the money trading.
 
This stock market environment—liquid, volatile, 
and increasingly retail-driven—has been a magnet  
for global proprietary trading firms. Jane Street 
was amongst the most aggressive. By 2024, it was  
reportedly making over a billion dollars a year 
trading options in India. The firm’s strategies,  
honed in the world’s most sophisticated markets, 
found fertile ground in India’s fast-moving,  
lightly regulated derivatives ecosystem.
As profits soared, so did regulatory anxiety.  
India's regulators had already started tightening 
rules late last year, raising minimum contract  
sizes and warning brokers to disclose the risks 
of options trading. According to the regulator,  
their concern was not just about volatility—it 
was about fairness. And when Jane Street’s  
trades began to dominate expiry-day 
volumes in key indices like BANKNIFTY,  
they claim that their concerns deepened.
Jane Street’s Indian operations kicked off  
in 2020, when it established a local entity in 
Mumbai. By 2023, it had become one of the largest  
foreign participants in India’s derivatives 
markets. According to the securities regulator,  
the firm made approximately $4.3 
billion dollars in profits between  
January 2023 and March 2025—most 
of it from trading index options.
 
Very little attention was paid to the 
goings on in India until April 2024 when  
Jane Street drew attention to themselves 
by filing a lawsuit in Manhattan against  
a rival hedge fund Millennium Management 
who hired two former Jane Street traders. 
 
The lawsuit alleged that the traders 
had stolen a “highly valuable, unique,  
and proprietary” trading strategy, which 
was later revealed by Millennium to relate  
to India’s booming options market. Jane Street 
and Millennium settled the lawsuit in December,  
but - the Indian securities regulator appears to 
have taken notice that two of the biggest trading  
firms in the world were fighting over a trading 
strategy focused on their securities market.
 
By this time last year, India’s national stock 
exchange had been asked to examine Jane Street’s  
trades. In February 2025, SEBI issued a formal 
caution letter, warning the firm to refrain from  
large, expiry-day positions and manipulative 
trading patterns. Jane Street responded,  
promising to adjust its strategies. 
But according to SEBI, the firm resumed  
similar trades by May—prompting the regulator’s 
most aggressive enforcement action in years.
 
At the heart of SEBI’s case is a strategy 
it calls “Intra-Day Index Manipulation.”  
The regulator’s analysis focuses on expiry 
days— the days when options contracts settle  
based on the closing value of an index like 
BANKNIFTY - a stock market index that tracks  
the performance of the banking sector in India.
The alleged scheme according to SEBI – had two  
phases which they refer to as patch 1 
and patch 2. In Patch I – which occurs  
in the morning – they allege that Jane Street 
aggressively bought large volumes of BANKNIFTY  
constituent stocks and futures, pushing the 
index higher. Simultaneously, they allegedly  
built massive short positions in the much more 
liquid options— by buying cheap Put options and  
selling expensive Call options —at prices which 
the regulators allege were distorted by their  
buying activity in the less liquid stocks.
In Patch Two – which occurs in the  
Afternoon - once the options positions were 
in place - Jane Street is accused of reversing  
course, by dumping their long positions in 
the less liquid stocks and futures - driving  
the index down, inflating the value of the puts 
and deflating the value of the calls (which they  
were short)—generating enormous profits.
SEBI focuses in on Jane Street’s trades on  
January 17, 2024 when Jane Street allegedly made 
about $86 million dollars in a single session,  
with trades accounting for up to 25% of 
market volume in some BANKNIFTY constituents 
 
Their detailed analysis of that day includes 
minute-by-minute breakdowns of Jane Street’s  
trades, their market impact, and the resulting 
profits from options positions, making it the  
centerpiece of the regulator’s case.
Their data shows that Jane Street lost  
money in the cash and futures markets—but more 
than made up for those losses in options.
 
SEBI estimates that Jane Street’s net 
trading value that day - came in at about  
$511 million dollars – which was more than three 
times the size of the market’s second largest  
player and about fifteen to twenty five percent of 
the entire market’s traded value. Over the course  
of eight minutes – they say - Jane Street had 
built a long position of $67 million dollars.
 
This almost single-handedly helped lift the 
BANKNIFTY index by over 1 per cent over the  
course of the buying spree, according 
to the Indian financial watchdog:
 
They argue that these losses were not incidental 
but deliberate: a cost incurred to manipulate the  
index and profit from options. Their report says 
that “There is no economic rationale possible to  
justify such trading activity on a standalone 
basis,” going on to say - “By preponderance of  
probability, these trades were undertaken only 
to distort BANKNIFTY index option prices.”
 
SEBI claim to have identified a second trading 
pattern: which it calls “Extended Marking the  
Close.” In this variant, Jane Street is alleged to 
have built large options positions during the day,  
then executed aggressive trades in the final 
hour to influence the index’s closing value.
 
On July 10, 2024, the regulator highlights 
that the firm allegedly sold large amounts  
of BANKNIFTY constituent stocks and futures in 
the final hour of trading—just as its options  
positions would benefit from a lower index 
close. A similar pattern – they claim - was  
observed on May 15, 2025, this time with bullish 
trades designed to push the index price higher.
 
In both cases, SEBI alleges that Jane Street’s 
trades were not about hedging or liquidity—they  
were about engineering a favorable expiry price.
Jane Street has strongly denied the allegations.  
In an internal memo to staff, the firm 
says that it was “beyond disappointed”  
by SEBI’s “inflammatory” language 
and would contest the findings.
 
The firm argues that its trades were standard 
index arbitrage—designed to profit from misaligned  
prices between options and their underlying 
stocks. “This activity is unambiguously good for  
the health of financial markets,” the memo said. 
“In the absence of participants like Jane Street,  
there would be no economic link between the Indian 
derivatives market and the underlying economy.”
 
Jane Street also disputes SEBI’s 
methodology, particularly its use  
of “market impact” metrics to infer intent. 
Matt Levine wrote an excellent piece on this  
earlier this week where he explained why 
there is so much derivatives trading in  
India – and then made the case that SEBI’s case 
is not as strong as it may first appear to be.
 
As to why Indians trade so many options – Levine 
explains that when you compare the Indian market  
to other big markets, it is much harder to 
get leverage on cash stock positions in India,  
or to sell stocks short. Because of this, 
lots of leveraged and long/short trading  
strategies are harder to do in India, but options 
— which do offer a lot of leverage — are a decent  
substitute – and allow traders to do the sort 
of trades that would be implemented using stocks  
in other markets. Additionally, some trading 
strategies that have to be implemented using  
stocks — like arbitraging options versus the 
underlying stocks — are harder to do in India,  
so some arbitrages won’t close 
and some spreads will be wider. 
 
There is something completely bizarre about 
the fact that on some days the Indian options  
market is 350 times bigger than the Indian stock 
market - and it’s easy to see how you could get in  
trouble trading Indian options – as while they 
are more liquid than Indian stocks - they are  
priced and settle based on the prices of Indian 
stocks. If you can move the stock prices – you  
will move the option prices - and the options 
are easier to trade, while the stock prices  
are easier to move. There is no way around it 
– it is a very strange market dynamic – and a  
market like this almost has to be inefficient.
Levine concludes that “legitimately doing an  
arbitrage trade” and “trading in one market 
to manipulate prices in another market” look  
pretty similar – and he jokes that “The 
difference between legitimate arbitrage  
and manipulation often comes down to 
whether you sent an email saying ‘lol  
I just manipulated the market – or not…
SEBI’s case rests on India’s Prohibition of  
Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices regulations, 
as well as Section 12A of the SEBI Act. These  
provisions prohibit any action that creates 
a false or misleading appearance of trading,  
or manipulates the price of a security or index.
The regulator also cites the Supreme Court’s 2018  
ruling in SEBI v. Rakhi Trading, which 
held that intentional loss-making trades  
can be evidence of manipulation. “Nobody 
intentionally trades for loss,” the court  
wrote. “An intentional trading for loss per 
se is not a genuine dealing in securities.”
 
SEBI’s interim order is not a final judgment. 
Jane Street has 21 days to respond and request  
a hearing. But the regulator has already frozen 
the firm’s accounts and ordered it to deposit  
$566 million dollars in an escrow account.
The Indian ban is a blow to Jane Street’s global  
operations, as not only did India account for 
around 14% of the firm’s trading revenues in 2023,  
it was also one of its fastest-growing 
and most profitable markets. The firm’s  
$4.3 billion dollars in Indian profits 
over two years came at a time when global  
investors were pulling back from China and 
looking to India as the next big frontier.
 
The Jane Street saga is more than a story about 
one firm’s alleged misconduct. It is a test case  
for how regulators in fast-growing markets 
respond to the rise of algorithmic trading,  
high-frequency strategies, and the increasing 
complexity of global capital flows.
 
For India, the case is a chance to 
reassert regulatory authority after  
years of criticism—most notably for its muted 
response to the Adani-Hindenburg affair. 
 
For Wall Street’s quant trading firms, it is a 
warning. The strategies that work in New York or  
London may not translate cleanly to Mumbai. And in 
markets where unsophisticated investors dominate  
and regulators are under pressure to protect them, 
the line between arbitrage and manipulation may be  
thinner—and more dangerous—than it appears.
As Jane Street prepares its legal defense  
and SEBI continues its investigation, one 
thing is clear: the era of quiet profits  
being earned by professional traders in 
India’s derivatives market may be over. 
 
While SEBI’s 105-page interim order paints a 
picture of deliberate and sinister manipulation,  
not everyone is convinced. As Robin 
Wigglesworth wrote in the FT “What might  
look like market manipulation could in fact 
just be arbitrage, and what might look like  
arbitrage can in fact be market manipulation”.
As Matt Levine pointed out –– on January 17,  
2024 – the date highlighted in SEBI’s interim 
order, the options market was trading at a  
1.6% premium to the underlying index that 
morning—a mispricing that an arbitrageur would  
naturally exploit by selling the overpriced 
options and buying the cheaper underlying  
stocks. This is - textbook arbitrage: If two 
identical assets—here, the cash index and the  
options-derived index—trade at different prices, 
you buy the cheap one and sell the expensive one,  
and that is what Jane Street did.
Levine also points out a critical flaw  
in SEBI’s narrative: the options prices didn’t 
rise during Jane Street’s alleged manipulation,  
they fell … While Jane Street was buying the 
underlying stocks, the prices of options on  
that index were going down – and that’s 
not what you’d expect if they were pumping  
the index to inflate options premiums.
The lack of clarity as to the intent of a  
trader can be particularly difficult to discern 
with high-frequency index-arbitrage strategies,  
where trades in one market are being done 
to hedge or exploit pricing in another.  
“Legitimately doing an arbitrage trade and trading 
in one market to manipulate prices in another  
market look pretty similar,” Levine writes.
Ultimately, a good argument can be made that  
Jane Street’s trades may have made markets 
more efficient, not less. “Instead of paying  
a 1.6% premium to take a position in the 
options market - retail investors could  
pay next to no premium if Jane Street pushed the 
options prices down and closed the arbitrage.
 
it’s worth stepping back to consider the sobering 
statistic that Indian retail investors managed to  
lose an estimated $33 billion dollars trading 
options over the past four years—despite the  
fact that the broader market that they 
are investing in has gone straight up.
 
These staggering losses, confirmed by 
SEBI and cited in the Financial Times,  
is not the result of a single firm’s strategy or 
a regulatory blind spot. It is the product of a  
system that encouraged millions of individuals to 
gamble on highly leveraged, short-term trades in  
one of the world’s most volatile markets.
As Ananth Narayan, a SEBI board member,  
noted in a public lecture in January, “a bulk 
of small investor losses were specifically in  
trading—indeed, overtrading in index options 
on expiry day, when premiums are very small.”  
In other words, the problem wasn’t just the 
market structure—it was investor behavior.
 
The lesson here is not just for regulators or 
trading firms. It’s for the millions of retail  
investors who were drawn into the options 
frenzy by the promise of quick profits and  
the allure of financial influencers. In a rising 
market, the simplest strategy—buying and holding  
quality stocks—would have outperformed 
the vast majority of leveraged bets.
 
Jane Street may have exploited inefficiencies 
in India’s derivatives market. But the far  
greater tragedy is that so many individual 
investors, armed with smartphones and leverage,  
chose to bet against the odds. And lost.
