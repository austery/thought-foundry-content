Imagine waking up tomorrow
and realizing your job,
everything that you've trained for,
everything that made your parents proud,
everything that made you feel useful
is no longer needed.
Not because you've done anything wrong,
but simply because an AI algorithm
can now do it better.
Take the example of Elena,
a medical doctor in Dubai.
For years, she was trusted
with life and death decisions.
But today, AI systems
can diagnose diseases,
can design treatments,
can even conduct consultations.
In fact, her hospital is already
considering cutting the headcount
of human physicians.
Elena is wondering,
if AI machines can take over
most of medicine,
what is left that only
a human doctor can do?
For millions like Elena around the world,
this is not science fiction anymore.
This is an unfolding reality,
and the part that worries me the most
is that we might be heading
toward not just a job crisis,
but also a purpose crisis.
But what if we're looking
at this the wrong way?
What if AI isn't the end of purpose,
but rather the beginning
for a new way to imagine it?
I work with country leaders
around the world
to shape national AI agendas,
build digital economies,
and design cities of the future.
And no matter where I go
and how technical the agenda is,
I almost always end up
hearing the same questions.
The first one is practical.
If AI is going to take over our jobs,
how are we going to survive?
How will we pay our bills?
Now that is the elephant in the room, yes.
And indeed, governments and economists
must start working very urgently
to redesign the very systems
that have been sustaining our communities.
But that's not the question
I want to focus on today,
because the second question
runs even deeper.
Will AI make us useless?
If we don't work, then who are we?
If I don't produce,
do I even still matter?
See, for centuries,
we've tied our identity
and our worth to what we do.
Farmers, factory workers,
coders, consultants,
work and jobs became the organizing
and defining principle
of our society in modern life.
But it wasn't always this way.
Before the Industrial Revolution,
our identity came from faith, from family,
from community.
Work was part of life.
But it wasn't the very definition of it.
Then came industrialization,
and we didn't just
industrialize production,
we also industrialized identity.
"What do you do"
became shorthand for "who are you?"
And AI today is dismantling,
fully, that model.
AI is automating tasks across the board.
In manufacturing and logistics,
in design, in customer services,
even in creative work.
AI today can compose a music,
can design codes,
can illustrate books, and way much more.
In fact, the World Economic Forum
predicts that by this year 2025,
AI will be doing more tasks than humans,
and hundreds of millions
of jobs are at risk.
But this isn't just about jobs.
This is about meaning.
This is about dignity.
This is about what happens
when the one thing that once gave us value
becomes obsolete.
And if we're not careful,
we might all be heading
toward a great depression.
But this time, not of income,
but of identity.
Let me introduce a framework
for human roles in the age of AI.
I call it the GAP circles.
The guardians,
the adapters,
and the pioneers.
Let's first start with the Guardians.
These are people that will be driven
by our survival as a humanity.
They'll be working
in medicine, in biology,
in pharmacology, in climate sciences.
But even their roles will be heavily
redefined and reshaped by AI.
Take the same person,
Elena, the medical doctor,
now a human validator
in an AI-led immunology lab.
The lead scientist
in her lab isn't a human,
but an AI trained
on global biomedical data.
Elena leverages her medical knowledge
to ensure that the output
is ethically sound
and human-relevant.
Next, we have the pioneers.
Those are driven by curiosity
rather than survival.
And to be clear, these two
don't always go hand in hand.
Will be the physicists,
the scientists, the explorers,
the astronauts, the philosophers.
A logistics manager
whose job has been fully replaced by AI
might find himself leaning
to an old passion for astronomy
and stargazing and the planetary systems.
And he uses AI-powered upscaling tools
to become a cosmic systems architect.
What a mouthful for a job title.
Anyway, he works with an AI
that is trained on decades
of astrophysics data.
Together, they simulate the cosmos.
And they explore together
what lies in the universe
behind our understanding.
And maybe one day, you never know,
they might discover aliens.
Sandwiched between
the two are the adapters.
The largest and probably
most overlooked circle or group.
Those won't be measured
by their output or their titles,
but rather by how they live,
how they connect,
and how they create meaning.
A graphic designer might find herself
rethinking her place in this world,
as AI automates most of her work,
so she pivots to community-
based creativity.
She runs community art workshops,
takes care of her father
and runs and hosts a podcast
on emotional intelligence.
Now, she's not
traditionally employed, yes,
but she deeply contributes
to her community.
Now, some of you might be thinking
this sounds like a new class system,
and in some ways it is.
But it's not going to be based
on wealth or status.
The guardians and the pioneers
might be the elites of the future,
but not for what they own,
but rather for what they contribute.
So legacy, not money,
becomes the currency
of aspiration in the future.
And these circles are likely to be fluid.
So a guardian today might
become an adapter in the future.
An adapter might push themselves
to become a pioneer, and so on.
And as AI continues to reshape work,
these roles might shrink in their scope,
but they will certainly expand
in their meaning or value.
And make no mistake,
the adapters themselves
will not be passive.
They will also seek recognition,
not wealth accumulation,
because in a world that is driven
less by money and more by contribution,
recognition becomes the new status symbol.
Now you might ask,
how can we make this real?
First,
we need to rethink
how we compensate contribution.
As AI reduces the need
for traditional work,
we need to design new systems
that can bring value
and security beyond the paychecks.
Ensuring that everyone
has guaranteed access
to the minimum level of resources
that would allow them
to live with dignity.
But beyond that foundation,
the additional earnings
people will be able to make
should depend on how they spend their time
through the small, meaningful
acts of contribution
that they can bring to their society,
like caring for an aging parent
or planting a public garden.
Through the connections they nurture
and the new meaning
they add in their communities.
Second, we need to rewire
education not only for skills,
but also for character.
Emotional intelligence,
ethics, resilience, creativity.
Education must prepare people
not only to earn, but also to belong.
Third, we must invest
in our emotional infrastructure.
As jobs disappear, so will identities.
And we need the spaces and the communities
that can help people
rediscover who they really are.
And finally,
we need the ecosystem
that would allow us to test
all of these ideas today.
Cities and campuses where we can pilot
new ways for contribution,
for recognition and for belonging.
Imagine waking up
every morning to a daily feed
not filled with stock prices,
but these beautiful
small contributions around you.
Who helped a child,
how to read today,
who composed a new music
that lifted spirits,
who mentored someone online,
who gave an inspiring TED talk today.
Each of these tasks and acts
might be small in their nature,
but together they become
the heartbeat of the society.
And let's be honest,
this isn't just about policy.
This is about the very
foundation of our society.
Our communities have been built
on a simple loop.
People work, earn, accumulate and spend.
Government tax that labor
to fund public life.
But in a world where
that traditional work disappears,
that loop breaks the assumption
that productivity means purpose
or that income means contribution.
All of that has to be revisited
and reimagined.
So the real question in the future
isn't will AI make us useless?
But rather, what do we choose to become
when we no longer
have to work just to survive?
And if that future sounds a bit abstract,
I want each one of you
to think about the most meaningful
and special moments in your life,
the ones that you remember
when you are either alone
or surrounded by those who you love.
Did these moments happen at your desk,
or were they moments of connection,
of creativity and compassion?
That is the future
we can and we should build.
But it won't happen by accident.
It will take policies, yes,
but even more, a cultural reset.
We must stop teaching people
that their worth will only be measured
by their output.
And we should start preparing people
for a future and a world
where work is no longer
the center of identity.
Because the age of AI isn't
just about testing our technology.
It's also about testing our imagination.
So let's imagine better.
Let's take this moment not as an ending,
but as an invitation
to rediscover purpose,
to redefine value,
and to reclaim the very essence
of what it truly means to be a human
in the age of AI.
Thank you.
