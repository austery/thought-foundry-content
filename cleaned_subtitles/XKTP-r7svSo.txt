Keynesian economics developed by John Maynard Kanes in his 1936 general theory revolutionized economic thinking by challenging classical assumptions that markets automatically self-correct. Kanes argued economies could reach equilibrium with high unemployment justifying government intervention. Aggregate demand the total spending on goods and services in an economy consumption plus investment plus government spending plus net exports. Canes identified insufficient demand as the primary cause of recessions, shifting focus from supply side concerns. Government intervention. When private spending falls during downturns, governments should increase spending and cut taxes to stimulate demand and restore full employment. This countercyclical approach aims to smooth business cycles. Multiplier effect. The phenomenon where initial government spending creates a ripple effect, generating more economic activity than the original expenditure. A $1 billion infrastructure project might generate $1.5 billion in total economic activity as workers spend their incomes. Liquidity preference. Keynes's theory explaining why people hold cash rather than investing for transactions, precaution, and speculation underpinning interest rate determination and monetary policy effectiveness. Classical economics emerged from Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, advocating free markets, where self-interest drives optimal outcomes without government interference. This foundational framework shaped economic thought for nearly a century. Invisible hand. Smith's metaphor describing how individuals pursuing self-interest unintentionally promote society's economic welfare. When people chase profits in competitive markets, they efficiently allocate resources, creating greater prosperity without central planning. Free markets. Markets function best when left alone with prices determined by natural supply and demand forces. Classical economists oppose tariffs, price controls and excessive regulations that distort these natural mechanism sees law. Jean Baptiste says principle that supply creates its own demand. Producing goods generates income used to purchase other goods making general overp production impossible in functioning markets. Comparative advantage. David Ricardo's theory demonstrating how countries benefit from specializing in goods they produce most efficiently relative to others. Then trading increasing global production and consumption even when one nation produces everything more efficiently. Monism developed primarily by Milton Freriedman in the mid- 20th century challenged Keynesian dominance by identifying erratic money supply not insufficient demand as the primary cause of economic instability. Money supply the total amount of money circulating in an economy. Montorists argue central banks should focus on maintaining steady, predictable growth in money supply rather than manipulating interest rates or engaging in discretionary intervention. Natural rate of unemployment. The lowest sustainable unemployment rate an economy can maintain without accelerating inflation. Montorists argue government attempts to push unemployment below this equilibrium level will only generate inflation rather than create lasting jobs. Quantity theory of money. The principle that money supply changes proportionally affect price levels. Doubling money supply eventually doubles prices. This relationship forms the foundation for controlling inflation through monetary discipline. monetary rules. Freriedman advocated replacing discretionary central bank decisions with fixed rules for money supply growth, believing predictable policy produces better outcomes than reactive intervention, which often arrives too late or creates additional instability. Supply side economics emerged during the 1970s stagflation crisis when Keynesian approaches faltered. Rather than focusing on demand, supply citers emphasize production incentives, arguing economic growth comes from reducing barriers to supplying goods and services. Laugher curve. Economist Arthur Ler's illustration showing that beyond a certain point, lower tax rates can generate higher government revenue by stimulating economic activity. This curve demonstrates that 0% and 100% tax rates both yield zero revenue with an optimal rate somewhere between tax cuts. Supply citers advocate reducing marginal tax rates particularly for businesses and highincome earners to encourage work saving investment and entrepreneurship. Lower rates increase after tax returns on productive activities. Trickle down effect. The theory that benefits from tax cuts for businesses and wealthy individuals eventually flow to middle and lower income groups through increased investment, job creation, and economic growth. Deregulation, removing government regulations that increase business costs and restrict market entry, allowing entrepreneurs and businesses to operate more efficiently and respond to market signals more effectively. Marxist economics developed by Karl Marx in Das Capital 1867 provides a radical critique of capitalism analyzing it as an inherently exploitative and crisisprone system driven by class conflict. Labor theory of value the principle that a commodity's value derives from the socially necessary labor time required for its production. Markx argued this reveals how capitalists extract surplus value from workers who receive wages worth less than the value they create. Surplus value, the difference between the value workers produce and the wages they receive. Markx identified this as the source of capitalist profit and the fundamental mechanism of exploitation as capitalists appropriate value created by workers labor. class struggle, the ongoing conflict between capitalists who own the means of production and workers who sell their labor power. Markx viewed this antagonism as the driving force of history and capitalism's development. Capital accumulation, the process whereby capitalists reinvest profits to expand production and increase capital. This competitive imperative leads to mechanization, worker displacement, falling profit rates and recurring crises. Contradictions Markx believed would ultimately undermine capitalism. Austrian school economics developed by Carl Manger, Ludvig Vanmis and Friedrich Hayek offers a distinctive approach to economic analysis emphasizing methodological individualism, subjective valuation and skepticism of government intervention. Spontaneous order, the concept that complex social institutions and arrangements, markets, language, law, emerge naturally from individual actions without central planning. Austrians argue these decentralized systems outperform designed alternatives by aggregating dispersed knowledge. Subjective theory of value. The principle that value derives not from labor, marks, or inherent properties, but from subjective individual preferences. Items are valuable only because individuals value them. Explaining why diamonds outpric water despite water's greater utility for survival. Knowledge problem. Hayek's observation that economic knowledge is dispersed among millions of individuals, making central planning impossible. Market prices transmit this decentralized information more efficiently than any planner could consolidate it. Business cycle theory. The Austrian explanation for booms and busts. Central bank manipulation of interest rates creates unsustainable investment patterns distorting the capital structure and inevitably leading to corrections. Neocclassical economics emerging in the 1870s through Alfred Marshall, Leon Walrus and William Stanley Jevans transformed classical economics by introducing mathematical formalism and marginal analysis becoming modern economics dominant framework. marginal utility, the additional satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good. Neocclassicals demonstrated that value derives from this marginal utility, not total utility, explaining why water, high total but low marginal utility, costs less than diamonds. Low total but high marginal utility. Rational choice theory, the assumption that individuals make logical decisions to maximize personal utility, weighing costs and benefits of each option given available information and constraints. This framework enables mathematical modeling of decision-m general equilibrium. Leon Walrus' model showing how all markets simultaneously determine prices that balance supply and demand economywide. Unlike partial equilibrium analyzing single markets, this approach reveals interconnected pricing systems. Perfect competition, a market structure with many small sellers offering identical products with perfect information and no barriers to entry, pushing prices toward marginal costs and optimizing resource allocation. Game theory revolutionized by John vonoman, Oscar Morgan Stern, and John Nash analyzes strategic interactions between rational decision makers where outcomes depend on choices made by all participants. Nash equilibrium, a state where each player chooses their optimal strategy given the strategies of others with no incentive to deviate unilaterally. This powerful concept explains stable outcomes in competitive situations from pricing decisions to arms races. Prisoners dilemma. A scenario where two rational individuals might not cooperate despite mutual benefit. When two isolated prisoners each face reduced sentences for betraying the other, rational self-interest leads both to confess, producing worse outcomes than mutual silence. demonstrating how individual rationality can create collective irrationality. Strategic interaction decisionm that explicitly accounts for others potential responses. Unlike traditional economics where agents respond only to prices, game theory examines how actors anticipate and influence competitors choices. Zero sum versus nonzero sum games. In zero- sum interactions, one player's gain equals another's loss. Poker, chess. Non-zero sum situations allow mutual gains or losses, trade, climate cooperation, enabling both conflict and cooperation analysis. Behavioral economics pioneered by psychologists Daniel Conaman and Amos Turski and economists like Richard Thaylor challenges the neocclassical assumption of rational economic actors by incorporating psychological insights. Loss aversion, the tendency to prefer avoiding losses over acquiring equivalent gains. Losses typically hurt about twice as much as gains feel good. This explains status quo bias, the endowment effect, and risk aversion in investment decisions. Prospect theory, Conoran and Tursky's alternative to expected utility theory, demonstrating that people evaluate outcomes relative to reference points rather than final states. Overweight low probabilities and underweight high probabilities when making decisions under uncertainty. Bounded rationality. Herbert Simon's concept recognizing humans face cognitive limitations when making decisions rather than optimizing people typically satisfies by selecting acceptable solutions that meet minimum criteria. mental accounting. People's tendency to categorize and treat money differently based on subjective criteria like source or intended use, violating the economic principle that money is fungeible, and explaining behaviors like saving for retirement while carrying high interest debt. New institutional economics pioneered by Ronald Coos, Douglas North and Oliver Williamson extends neocclassical theory by analyzing how institutions, formal rules and informal constraints shape economic performance and outcomes. Transaction costs, expenses incurred when making economic exchanges beyond the price of the product itself, including search, bargaining, and enforcement costs. NIE uses these to explain why firms exist when markets could theoretically coordinate all activities. Property rights legal frameworks determining how resources can be used, transferred, and protected. NIE demonstrates how well-defined, secure property rights encourage investment and efficient resource allocation by providing certainty for economic actors. Path dependence. The concept that historical events and initial institutional choices constrain future possibilities, explaining why inefficient arrangements persist. Past decisions create self-reinforcing processes that make institutional change difficult. Governance structures, organizational arrangements designed to minimize transaction costs under conditions of bounded rationality and opportunism. NIE analyzes how various governance forms, markets, hierarchies, networks, and hybrids emerge to address different transaction characteristics. New Keynesian economics developed by economists like Joseph Stiglets, Greg Manu, and Janet Yellen since the 1980s reconciles Keynesian insights about market failures with neocclassical micro foundations and rational expectations. Sticky prices and wages. The observation that many prices and wages adjust slowly rather than instantaneously to changing economic conditions. Contract obligations, menu costs, and social norms create rigidities that prevent markets from quickly clearing. Menu costs. The expenses businesses incur when changing prices, updating cataloges, reprinting menus, reprogramming systems. Even small menu costs can rationally lead firms to maintain prices despite changed conditions, creating meaningful macroeconomic effects. Imperfect competition. Most real world markets feature monopolistic competition or oligopoly rather than perfect competition. Firms retain some price setting power creating inefficiencies that justify intervention. Efficiency wages. the practice of paying workers above market clearing wages to increase productivity, reduce turnover, or attract higher quality employees. This explains persistent unemployment as a rational employer strategy rather than market failure. Public choice theory developed by James Buchanan and Gordon Tullik in the 1960s applies economic analysis to political decision-making, challenging assumptions that government intervention automatically corrects market failures. Rent seeking activities where individuals or groups expend resources to obtain special government privileges, subsidies, regulations, tariffs that create artificial scarcity and wealth transfers. Unlike profit seeking which creates value, rent seeking redistributes existing wealth while consuming resources. Rational voter ignorance. Voters remain uninformed about political issues because the personal cost of gathering information exceeds the expected benefit since individual votes rarely determine outcomes. This explains why special interests with concentrated benefits often outmaneuver diffuse public interests. Regulatory capture the process whereby regulatory agencies gradually serve the interests of the industries they regulate rather than the public interest. Officials career concerns, information asymmetries and concentrated industry power facilitate this phenomenon. Concentrated benefits, dispersed costs. Programs that provide substantial benefits to small groups while spreading costs thinly across the general population create powerful lobbying incentives, explaining persistent inefficient policies. Modern monetary theory developed by economists like Warren Mosler, Stephanie Kelton, and Bill Mitchell challenges conventional thinking about government finances by focusing on the unique powers of monetary sovereign nations. monetary sovereignty. Nations that issue their own currencies, collect taxes in those currencies and don't fix exchange rates or promise conversion to precious metals face fundamentally different constraints than households or businesses. They cannot run out of money. Functional finance, the principle that government fiscal policy should be evaluated based on real world outcomes. employment, inflation, growth rather than arbitrary budget targets. Deficits and surpluses are tools, not goals themselves. Sectoral balances. The accounting identity showing that government deficits create private sector surpluses. When government spends more than it taxes, the non-government sector, households and businesses, must accumulate the difference as net financial assets. Job guarantee. MMT advocates a permanent public employment program offering jobs to anyone willing to work at a living wage serving as both an automatic stabilizer and inflation anchor. Feminist economics developed by scholars like Marilyn Wearing and Julie Nelson since the 1990s challenges mainstream economics by examining how gender shapes economic structures outcomes and theory itself. unpaid domestic labor, the economic value created through household work, child care, and elder care, predominantly performed by women, that remains uncounted in GDP despite contributing significantly to economic welfare. Feminist economists argue this omission distorts policy priorities. Care economy, the sector encompassing both paid and unpaid care work that sustains human capabilities. Feminist economists demonstrate how traditional economic models undervalue this essential work by focusing on market transactions while ignoring reproduction and maintenance of human life. Gender power dynamics. How unequal power relations between genders affect economic outcomes from wage differentials to household resource allocation. These dynamics challenge neocclassical assumptions about rational autonomous actors making decisions in neutral markets, non-market activities, economic contributions occurring outside formal markets, including household production, volunteer work, and community organizing. Feminist economists develop methodologies to measure and value these activities typically excluded from economic analysis. Ecological economics pioneered by Herman Daly and Robert Costanza reconceptualizes economics by positioning the economy as a subsystem of Earth's finite biosphere challenging conventional assumptions about unlimited growth. Natural capital, the world's stock of natural resources, forests, minerals, biodiversity, ecosystem services that provide essential inputs and life support functions for human society and the economy. Unlike manufactured capital, many forms of natural capital cannot be produced or replaced. Steadystate economics. Herman Dy's framework for an economy that maintains constant stocks of physical capital and population with material throughput remaining within ecological limits. This challenges growth focused economic models by prioritizing qualitative development over quantitative expansion. Limits to growth. The concept that finite resource availability and ecosystem absorption capacity impose absolute constraints on economic expansion contradicting mainstream economics assumption of indefinite growth potential through technology and substitution. Ecosystem services. The benefits humans receive from functioning ecosystems, water purification, climate regulation, pollination, often unpriced in markets despite underpinning economic activity. Ecological economists develop methods to value these services and incorporate them into decisionmaking.
