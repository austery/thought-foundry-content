Last week I spent 47 hours researching tech ecosystem in the Gulf for a single video. 47 hours. And by the end of it I had 36 bookmarks, 19 PDFs downloaded to my desktop and 12 videos saved on YouTube. And that was before I started doing the factecking on all the information I found online. This is the reality behind everywhere to run episode. You get a 15-minute video about what's happening around the world in the tech industry. But what you don't see is me drowning in research papers, online articles, substacks, videos, Reddit threads with conflicting opinions trying to figure out if the stats I found are actually current or from 2019. And here's the thing. I know that a lot of you are dealing with this exact problem. It happens when you're job hunting and researching companies. It happens when you're at school trying to process massive amounts of information. It happens when you're fully immersed in your hobby, for example, music, and you're going through music videos, performers, sheet music, composers, and what they're known for. It also happens at work when you're doing market or competitive research, trying to make sense of conflicting numbers online. The information is out there, but finding it, organizing it, and actually using it, that's where most of us fall apart. The research I do is by far the most time-conuming part of the entire video creation process for my channel. And you may think, well, with so many AI tools on the market, what's so difficult about it? Find the info, summarize it, spit it out. Well, not quite. Because when you're doing real research with secondary data, meaning the data that you did not produce yourself, you can't just copy and paste random articles into a chat and hope for the best. I need to track where the information is coming from, who funded the primary source, whether the conclusions were made on a representative sample, how the results were measured, cross reference conflicting data points, verify that the stats I'm using are actually legitimate and current. Most AI tools will give you an answer, but they don't help you build actual understanding or keep track of how different pieces of information work together. So, despite the availability of AI, I spend lots of time reading every piece of content I get my information from. So, when this company, Recall, reached out, I was honestly skeptical, another AI productivity app. But after actually putting it through its paces on my Switzerland video research, I realized that it tackles the exact problems I just described. And for full transparency, they're sponsoring this video, but I'm only showing this to you because it genuinely changed how I work. Let me show you exactly what I mean. Their browser extension is honestly what makes Recall completely different from everything else on the market. While other apps make you manually upload files, Recall captures everything as you browse. Their browser extension seamlessly integrates into your research process, so you can do research and summarization as you browse the content online. So, what makes Recall different from other AI productivity tools? That was my exact question, too. After using it for my Switzerland video research, here's what I found. It handles every type of content I throw at it. PDFs, YouTube videos, articles, Reddit threads, even books. But more importantly, it keeps everything connected instead of treating each piece of information like it exists in isolation. Let me walk you through my actual research process and show you where exactly it made the biggest difference. When I start my research, I'm not just looking for any information. I'm hunting for the source behind the source. For example, I found an article about the Swiss job market and Q1 2025, but it's actually based on research from ADO in partnership with the University of Zurich. So, I need to track down that original university study, not just a summary someone wrote about it. Sometimes I can't find the original source, sometimes I can't. like in this case where I'm stuck with a nine-page summary, but you can see how this multiplies quickly. This is just one piece of research and I typically go through about 50 resources per video. If you've already started your research and began saving countless bookmarks and now wondering how you can port them all over, Recall has got you covered. Simply create a cart and click to import bookmarks, and you can upload up to 200 at a time. What's really powerful here is that Recall doesn't just dump them all in another list. It automatically categorizes everything and creates individual cards for each bookmark. That way, your bookmarks become part of your active knowledge system, searchable and ready to connect with your other research and notes. So, here is an example of a PDF report that I found about the Swiss job market. And now I want to feed it to Recall. So, I'm going to go ahead and create a card. And as you can see, there are plenty of different formats that I can feed to Recall. But right now, I'm going to go ahead and upload the PDF. And I hit create. And there's my card. So now I have my original document on the left and then the summary on the right. Now the summary that you're seeing here is the concise summary, but I can also go ahead and create a detailed summary of the exact same report. So with recall, I can chat with my own document. And here is an example of what I can do. I want to take a closer look at the graph that you're seeing on the screen. And I'm asking recall to dissect it and interpret the data that it's seeing. And here is the analysis that I'm getting. And now I'm going to go ahead and add it to the notebook. Now the notebook feature is where you can actually compile a report based on the information that you're getting. Recall also highlights the keywords that are being used in the document and I can find the definitions of those words and there is actually a page where I can even add my own notes. Now as I'm working on my own research summary, I can also add some of the notes for myself directly in the notebook feature. So for example, I have a question about which specific jobs were used for this report and that is a separate to-do item for myself. I'm going to add it as a task for myself. I'm going to highlight it so that I know that I need to come back to it to refine my numbers. And you can upload as many PDF documents as you need and interact with them directly in the recall app. I remember seeing people on Reddit talking about cyber security jobs in Switzerland being overhyped. But which thread was that? So here's what I started doing. I take all of these Reddit discussions, summarize them with recall, and then I cross-check the official research against what people who actually work there are saying. real people, real experiences, not just corporate surveys. So, as you can see, I have plenty of Reddit threads open in my browser, and now I want to summarize every single one of them, stand what the locals are saying about the actual text scene, so that I can later compare it to all the research that I am able to produce based on the resources that I'll find. But you can tell every single thread is pretty long. And with the recall app, I can summarize every thread and link it to the recall account. So, I'm repeating the same thing with every thread that I look at. And while I'm doing this, as soon as I click on the recall extension button, it automatically creates a card for me in the app so that I can come back to it whenever I want. And now you can see all the threads that I just saved. All of them are linked in the app. Every single one has its own card. And I can interact with every thread in the same way I interact with the PDF document or with the video summary. You can choose to save all of your summarizations automatically or keep the toggle off if you need some time to make a decision whether you want to save it or not. And then there's also this feature called augmented browsing. That's honestly a game changer when you're deep in research mode. I'll show you what I mean. You need to turn this on in the settings, but once you do, everything stays local on your device. No data leaves your computer, which is huge for privacy. The first thing you're going to need is to have the browser extension downloaded. And then what you're going to notice is that the next time you start browsing any website, a little widget starts to appear on the side of the screen. You can choose to hide it completely in the settings or you can choose to keep it. Now it gives you an option to jump straight to the core functions that recall offers which is the summary, the notebook function where you can make your own notes using the summarization you got or another option is to chat with the content. But the special thing about it is that it shows you the number of connections you already have with your existing knowledge base. First of all, when you first click on the connection, it gives you the summary of the given word and it also connects it to your existing knowledge base. And if you click on it, it'll bring you to the pages in your knowledge base where you already have this definition saved. Lastly, and it's really important for privacy. The augmented browsing is local first. Everything you save stays local on your device and no data will leave your computer. The Switzerland video was honestly the most challenging one in the entire series. It's surprising how little written content exists about the Swiss tech scene. Way less than I expected. So, I had to rely heavily on video content, which creates a completely different research problem. With articles, you can skim through and decide fairly quickly whether it's worth your time or not. With videos, you have to actually watch them to figure out if there is anything useful in there. A 20-minute conference talk may have one relevant statistic at minute 17. Recall's video summarization feature actually saved me hours. Instead of spending hours on videos that I wasn't sure about, I could get intelligent summaries and then decide which ones deserved my full attention. Here's how I use recall for video summarization. Here you can see a bunch of tabs with videos about Switzerland's tech scene. As I said, there is surprisingly little content on the text scene specifically. So, I have to go through a lot of videos this time to see if there are any insights that I can grab for my research. And as you can see, each video is fairly long. So watching all of them from start to finish hoping to find at least one thing that can be useful would take me hours if not days. But with recall I can get a full summary of each video in a few clicks and quickly decide whether I want to spend my time watching the entire video or not. And as always, all of this information gets saved into a recall card that I can access directly in the app at any time and not worry about losing the link to the original video. A few more things and how you can work with video summarization. When you open the video and click on the browser extension button, as always, you will get the transcript under the reader tab. But on top of the transcript, you can skip to any part of the video by clicking on the time code just like this. And as you can see, it takes me straight to the exact moment where this information is mentioned. Now, I'm looking at the detailed summary here. And I notice something that catches my attention. So, I decide to ask a follow-up question. And there's my answer. And this is definitely something that I'll want to include as a data point in my script. So, now I'm going to copy this into my notebook, highlight the most important fact, and add my own notes. Now I'm just going to make sure that there is a card associated with this video in the recall app. And there it is along with my notes. So now I'm back in the app with everything. PDFs, articles, video summaries, Reddit discussions, all in one place. But it's not just a dump of information. There is this graph view that actually maps out how different topics connect to each other. I can see the relationships between salary data, cost of living, cities, topics that I might have missed while looking at sources individually. There's also this feature called graph, which is the visual representation of all connections between the content that you saved. It shows key terms that connect all of your notes together, and you can jump from one subtopic to another while staying focused on the topic you're researching. When I'm putting together content for the video, this is where everything comes together. I'm not just copying and pasting. I'm cross-referencing data points, checking that my statistics are actually saying what I think they're saying. When I make claims like cyber security salaries increase 15% year-over-year, I need to make sure that I'm using the right baseline and the right time frame. The connections feature lets me trace back through everything I found on a given topic. Now, I've been talking about this from a content creator perspective, but the more I use recall, the more I realize that it's not just a research tool. In my professional life as a product manager trying to understand the competitive landscape, I am dealing with the exact same problem. scattered information across analyst reports, competitor websites, customer feedback, and industry publications. Same thing if you're in marketing, for example, doing market research. You've got survey data, social media sentiment, industry reports, competitor campaigns, and these different types of content that need to be synthesized into actionable insights. The tool handles all of it in the same way, whether it's a PDF from Gardner or a Twitter thread from industry experts. Now, recall also has this great feature that helps you retain the information you learned. This comes in really handy if you're preparing for a test or an exam. In fact, it's a fantastic app for everything education related when you have to process record amount of information in the smallest period of time and be able to retain it so that you do well on a test. To make use of the quiz function, all you have to do is just come back to your recall card and navigate to the quiz tab and click generate questions and it will automatically create questions based on the content of the card to test your knowledge. On top of that, it automatically connects to a larger feature called review. The review feature tests you on all the content you wish to be tested on. The feature is based on active learning techniques and repetition to help you retain the information you need the most. The more questions you get correct, the less you see them. The more you get wrong, the more it starts popping up. So, like I said before, the more you use the app, the more personalized it becomes to help you get the most out of your research and lock it in your long-term memory. Before this, I was drowning in bookmarks that I'd save and later think, why did I save this? And copying links into my notes without remembering what I needed them for. Now I have one place where I can not only store everything, but actually interact with the connected knowledge base. So that's the real value of this app, turning information overload into actual understanding. Whether you're job hunting, studying for exams, building a business, or just trying to make sense of complex topics, the problem is always the same. too much scattered information, not enough connection between the pieces. If you're wondering how recall compares to Notebook LM or YouTube Premium, here's the difference. Notebook LM is a research tool, while Recall is a personal knowledge base for all of your content from books, movies, recipes, personal notes, videos, and blogs that links everything together. Recall's browser extension is what makes Recall truly powerful. You have a seamless workflow between research and browsing. And augmented browsing is something that no competitor has. When it comes to video summarization, Recall works with all sources, not just YouTube, so you don't have to worry about which platform you're browsing. Recall works with everything. I've put the link to the app in the description. The free version will show you what I'm talking about. You can test it with your own research process and see if it clicks. But if your time really matters to you and you're the type of person who really cares about getting to the truth instead of just skipping services, the paid version is well worth it. It's very affordable and it lets you do unlimited research on any topic you'd like. The company also makes constant updates to the app and releases new features. Regal works both as a website and a mobile app and you can capture ideas and sources wherever you are. Your knowledge base syncs across everything. The team behind it is also very open to feedback and feature requests. And you can find a dedicated space for all things feedback at feedback.recall.ai. To learn more, go to their website getrecall.ai. And if you use my code tech30, you'll get 30% off of a subscription. And hurry up, the link is valid until July 1st, 2025. You're already doing the hard work of finding great information. The real problem is remembering where you found it 6 months later or realizing how it connects to something you learned yesterday. When your knowledge base starts organizing itself and making those connections automatically, that's when research actually becomes useful instead of overwhelming. Huge thanks to Recall for sponsoring this video. I absolutely enjoyed using your product and will definitely use it for all of my future videos. As always, I hope this was helpful. Till next time.
