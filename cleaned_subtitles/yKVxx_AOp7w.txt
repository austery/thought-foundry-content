哈嘍大家好 Hello everyone 我是莊也 I'm Zhuang Ye 歡迎您收看莊也雜談 Welcome to Zhuang Ye's Talk 今兒咱們聊一聊 Today, let's talk about 最近在加拿大政壇上興起的一股 A recent phenomenon emerging in Canadian politics 自由黨迴光返照的現象 The phenomenon of the Liberal Party's last gasp 大家都知道 As everyone knows 從2024年的年底到2025年的1月初 From the end of 2024 to early January 2025 曾經風光無限的自由黨如寒冬的殘葉 The once-glorious Liberal Party was like withered leaves in the cold winter 是一片凋零 Completely falling apart 不僅是內閣辭職 Not only did the cabinet resign 黨魁下台 The party leader stepped down 而且自由黨的民調跌到了16% And the Liberal Party's poll numbers dropped to 16% 被保守黨拉開將近20個百分點 Trailing the Conservative Party by nearly 20 percentage points 但是誰也沒有想到 But no one expected 轉眼到了2025年的2月底 That by the end of February 2025 風雲突變 The situation would dramatically shift 自由黨如同新芽破土 The Liberal Party, like new sprouts breaking through the soil 逆勢回升 Began a remarkable recovery 不僅在社交媒體上 Not only on social media 留住特魯多這個標籤 The hashtag "Keep Trudeau" 引爆熱搜 Went viral 而且在各大民調機構最新的數字顯示 And the latest figures from major polling agencies show 自由黨的支持率是大幅攀升 The Liberal Party's support rate has surged significantly 甚至在某些個別的民調機構 Even in some individual polling agencies 自由黨的支持率已經開始領先保守黨 The Liberal Party's support has started to surpass the Conservative Party 你看從全面落後到勢均力敵 Look, from being completely behind to neck-and-neck 自由黨 The Liberal Party 只用了短短不到2個月的時間 Took less than two months 看到這兒 Seeing this 肯定很多人都會問 Many people must be wondering 究竟是因為什麼原因 What exactly caused 點燃了自由黨逆風翻盤的焰火 The spark that ignited the Liberal Party's comeback against the odds 在這場沒有回頭的重生之旅中 In this irreversible journey of rebirth 自由黨是如何抓住選民的心 How did the Liberal Party win over voters' hearts 絶地反擊 To stage a desperate counterattack 涅槃重生 And rise from the ashes 今天 就讓我們撥開迷霧 Today, let's clear the fog 一探究竟 And find out 首先咱們得看一看 First, we need to take a look 自由黨出現民調反彈 At whether the Liberal Party's polling rebound 這事到底是不是真的 Is actually real 這個咱們數字說話 Let's let the numbers speak 咱們先回頭看一下 First, let's look back 2024年的12月底 To late December 2024 自由黨的支持率當時創下了歷史新低 The Liberal Party's support hit an all-time low 根據7家不同的民調機構公佈的數據 According to data released by seven different polling agencies 自由黨支持率的區間是從16%到23.8% The Liberal Party's support ranged from 16% to 23.8% 而保守黨則是從43%到48% While the Conservative Party ranged from 43% to 48% 你看 You see 保守黨領先自由黨將近20個百分點 The Conservative Party led the Liberal Party by nearly 20 percentage points 好 接下來 Alright, next 咱們看一看 Let's take a look 2月底的最新各項民調數據 At the latest polling data from late February 你看 咱們就拿這個 Look, let's take this one 2月18日發佈的Nanos民調顯示 The Nanos poll released on February 18 shows 自由黨的支持率已經提升到了32% The Liberal Party's support has risen to 32% 雖然說仍舊落後保守黨的這個39% Although it still trails the Conservative Party's 39% 但是 But 這個差距已經縮小到了7個百分點 The gap has narrowed to 7 percentage points 另外還有 And also Leger公佈的這個 The one released by Leger 2月21日到2月23日的民意調查 The poll from February 21 to February 23 自由黨是35% The Liberal Party is at 35% 而保守黨是38% While the Conservative Party is at 38% 你看 保守黨只領先了3個百分點 You see, the Conservative Party is only ahead by 3 percentage points 只相差一個身位 Just a hair's breadth apart 而12月底 And at the end of December 保守黨對自由黨是43%對21% The Conservative Party was at 43% to the Liberal Party's 21% 當時是22%的差距 That was a 22% gap 現在只剩下3%了 Now it's down to just 3% 而且還有更誇張的 And there's something even more striking 根據這個Ipsos 2月21日-2月24日 According to the Ipsos poll from February 21 to February 24 發佈的一項民意調查顯示 A survey released shows 自由黨已經拿到了36%的支持率 The Liberal Party has reached 36% support 而保守黨只有31% While the Conservative Party is at just 31% 你看自由黨已經反超了5個百分點 You see, the Liberal Party has overtaken them by 5 percentage points 這是近年來非常罕見的現象 This is a very rare phenomenon in recent years 立刻就引起了老百姓們的關注 It immediately caught the public's attention 當然 Ipsos這個民調數據的反超 Of course, this Ipsos poll showing a lead 到底是否科學 Whether it's scientifically sound 是否這裡面有有什麼數字上的貓膩 Whether there's any trickery in the numbers 或者說是具有普遍性的代表性 Or if it's broadly representative 已經能夠持續多久 And how long it can last 這個還有待商榷 That remains up for debate 但是不可否認的是 But what cannot be denied is 目前自由黨的民調反彈 The Liberal Party's current polling rebound 已經是一個板上釘釘的事了 Is already a done deal 雖說總體上還沒有超過保守黨 Although overall it hasn't surpassed the Conservative Party 但是雙方差距的迅速拉近 The rapid narrowing of the gap between the two 已經為保守黨敲響了警鐘 Has already sounded the alarm for the Conservative Party 咱們乾脆這麼說 Let's just put it this way 您能聽得懂 So you can understand 如果是兩個月前 If it were two months ago 甚至說是一個月前開始大選 Or even a month ago when the election started 保守黨還可以說是穩操勝券 The Conservative Party could have been confident of victory 但是如果現在開始大選的話 But if the election started now 那究竟鹿死誰手 Who would come out on top 那就不好說了 That's hard to say 另外在X社交媒體上 Also on X social media 也出現了另外一件非常弔詭的事 Another very strange thing has emerged 就是從2月22號開始 Starting from February 22 突然出現了一個留住特魯多 Suddenly, a "Keep Trudeau" 這麼一個標籤 Hashtag appeared 然後迅速引爆熱搜 And quickly went viral 就是有一些特魯多的支持者們 Some of Trudeau's supporters 在X上發佈特魯多的舊照 Posted old photos of Trudeau on X 懇求特魯多撤回辭職決定 Pleading with Trudeau to retract his resignation 繼續留任加拿大總理 And continue serving as Canada's Prime Minister 並且帶領自由黨團隊與特朗普對抗 And lead the Liberal team to confront Trump 然後這事 And this matter 也是迅速在社會上引發激烈的討論 Quickly sparked heated discussions in society 網友們也是分成兩派 Netizens have split into two camps 吵翻了天 Arguing fiercely 看到這我心裡其實也是百味雜陳 Seeing this, I feel a mix of emotions 這裡我也不怕承認我的政治傾向 Here, I'm not afraid to admit my political leanings 我是支持保守黨的 I support the Conservative Party 雖說我上集節目中 Although in the last episode 在介紹自由黨的各位候選人的時候 When introducing the Liberal Party candidates 介紹的比較詳細 I went into quite a bit of detail 而且把他們的執政理念也都說了一遍 And explained all their governing philosophies 於是有些人 So some people 就誤以為 Mistakenly thought 我是在大力宣傳自由黨的政策 I was heavily promoting Liberal Party policies 還有的網友就特別有意思 Some netizens were particularly amusing 說莊也你是表面支持保守黨 Saying, “Zhuang Ye, you claim to support the Conservatives on the surface 背後實際你是自由黨派來的臥底 But secretly you're an undercover agent sent by the Liberals” 聽完之後我也是苦笑了半天 After hearing that, I gave a wry smile for a while 不過你做節目得保持中立 But when making a show, you have to stay neutral 你才能做好一個政治評論性的節目 Only then can you do a good political commentary program 你看我在節目中說的話 Look at what I say in the show 讓你看不出我是哪個黨的粉絲 It doesn't reveal which party I'm a fan of 要的就是這個效果 That's the effect I'm going for 不過話又說回來了 But getting back to the point 我心中還是挺希望保守黨的博勵治 In my heart, I still hope the Conservative Party's Pierre Poilievre 能夠帶我們重新回到哈珀時代的榮光 Can lead us back to the glory of the Harper era 帶領加拿大走出一條 And guide Canada onto a path 跟過去10年不一樣的執政道路 Different from the governing approach of the past 10 years 但是現在 But now 看到自由黨的民調反彈這麼劇烈 Seeing the Liberal Party's polling rebound so dramatically 心裡還是有一點點忐忑不安的 I still feel a bit uneasy 為保守黨捏一把汗 Sweating a little for the Conservative Party 不過 我不得不說 However, I have to say 這次自由黨的反彈也是情理之中 This Liberal Party rebound makes sense 也是合情合理的 And is quite reasonable 這裡面不僅歸功于 This is not only due to 自由黨自己本身的這個危機應對措施 The Liberal Party's own crisis response measures 比較得當 Which have been fairly effective 還有來自外部勢力 But also the assistance from external forces 的助攻加持 Providing a boost 下面咱們就來分析一下 Let's analyze below 自由黨突然的逆勢上揚 The sudden upward surge of the Liberal Party 這背後的原因是什麼 What's behind it 而面對這些原因 And in the face of these reasons 保守黨又是如何反擊的 How is the Conservative Party responding 自由黨民調逆勢上揚 The Liberal Party's polling surge against the odds 第一個原因就是特魯多這次的辭職 The first reason is Trudeau's resignation this time 造成的一個切割重置的效果 Which created a severance and reset effect 很多人估計沒有看出來 Many people probably didn't realize 特魯多當時突然辭職 That Trudeau's sudden resignation at the time 對政壇的影響有多大 Had such a huge impact on the political scene 只是看到了特魯多支持率這麼低 They only saw Trudeau's support rate being so low 然後自己辭職 And then him resigning 就感覺挺解氣的 Which felt quite satisfying 但是您沒有看出來他這背後的深意 But you didn't see the deeper intention behind it 他實際上是故意的 He did it on purpose 把此前十年執政期間所有的爛攤子 Taking all the messes from the past ten years of governance 一塌糊塗的經濟 A disastrous economy 高到天際的財政赤字 Sky-high fiscal deficits 高昂的住房成本 Soaring housing costs 不斷升高的犯罪率 Rising crime rates 所有的這些 往自己身上一攬 Taking all of these upon himself 然後一辭職 And then resigning 目的就是跟他人撇清關係 The goal was to distance himself from others 至少是為這幾位 At least for these few 將要參加下屆黨魁選舉的這幾個人 Who will participate in the next party leadership election 幾乎跟他切割的是乾乾淨淨 Almost completely cutting ties with him 你看這個弗蘭克.貝利斯 Take Frank Baylis, for example 他前幾年沒有從政嗎 Wasn't he out of politics a few years ago? 卡琳娜.古爾德 Karina Gould 在特魯多內閣中後期 In the later stages of Trudeau's cabinet 也是沒有擔任任何的部長職位 Also didn't hold any ministerial positions 而方慧蘭 And Chrystia Freeland 乾脆就是跟特魯多政見不合 Simply had political differences with Trudeau 然後自己辭職 And then resigned herself 把自己塑造成了一個 Shaping herself into 特魯多反叛者的形象 An image of a Trudeau rebel 尤其是最後這位候選人 Especially this last candidate 也就是自由黨下屆黨魁最熱門的人選 The most popular contender for the next Liberal Party leader 馬克.卡尼 Mark Carney 他乾脆就是一個 He's simply 從來沒有在特魯多內閣中任職的 Someone who never served in Trudeau's cabinet 局外人 An outsider 清新脫俗的一個新人形象 A fresh and refined newcomer image 你看這4個人 Look at these four people 一個頂一個的 Each one outdoing the next 讓憎恨特魯多的選民們 Making it hard for voters who hate Trudeau 恨不起來 To hold a grudge against them 唯一能夠跟特魯多扯上關係的 The only connection to Trudeau 就是就是他們這些人跟特魯多都是 Is that these people and Trudeau are all 同一個黨派的 From the same party 之前有些人曾經跟特魯多有過交集 Some of them had dealings with Trudeau before 或者是作為特魯多手下具體辦事的 Or worked directly under Trudeau 或者是作為顧問的 Or served as advisors 但是 But 他們應該為特魯多的糟糕執政表現 Should they be held responsible for Trudeau's poor governance 負責嗎? 如果需要負責的話 If they should, 那麼他們究竟在多大程度上 To what extent 影響並參與了特魯多的政策的制定 Did they influence and participate in shaping Trudeau's policies 他們到底是跟特魯多沆瀣一氣 Were they in cahoots with Trudeau 狼狽為奸 Colluding together 還是說為了老百姓剛直不阿 Or were they upright and advocating for the people 為民請命 Fighting for the public 這些都沒有辦法量化 These things can't be quantified 但是效果我們都看到了 But we've all seen the results 特魯多這一辭職 Trudeau's resignation 相當於為自由黨摁下了一個reset鍵 Was like pressing a reset button for the Liberal Party 重啟了 A restart 這就跟咱們重啟計算機一樣 It's just like restarting a computer 你看咱們用過電腦都知道 You know from using computers 一重啟 大部分問題都自動解決了 Once you restart, most problems fix themselves 那麼這次自由黨的重啟 So this Liberal Party restart 自然也會在潛意識中 Naturally, in the subconscious 給選民們 Gives voters 一個 A 問題即將得到解決的這麼一個暗示 Hint that the problems are about to be resolved 相當於告訴選民們 It's tantamount to telling voters 自由黨最大的障礙是特魯多 The Liberal Party's biggest obstacle was Trudeau 而且他已經走了 And he's already gone 黨和選民之間沒有障礙了 There's no barrier between the party and the voters anymore 重啟過的自由黨 The restarted Liberal Party 他是一個脫胎換骨 Is a transformed 煥發新生的新希望 Renewed hope 所以說 So 您看的這個自由黨玩的這一套 What you see the Liberal Party doing here 其實 Actually 反面的這個博勵治所代表的保守黨 On the flip side, the Conservative Party represented by Pierre Poilievre 他們肯定也看到了 They've definitely noticed 他們肯定也不會讓自由黨 And they definitely won't let the Liberal Party 這麼容易的脫胎換骨 Transform so easily 重新煥發新生 And renew itself 最有效的辦法 The most effective way 就是不斷提醒加拿大老百姓了 Is to keep reminding Canadian citizens 自由黨就是自由黨 The Liberal Party is the Liberal Party 狗改不了吃屎 A leopard can't change its spots 下去一個特魯多 再上來的 One Trudeau leaves, and whoever comes next 甭管上來的是誰 No matter who it is 那都是特魯多遺產的繼承者 They're all inheritors of Trudeau's legacy 都不會彌補 They won't make up for 他們之前對加拿大老百姓的傷害 The harm they've done to Canadian citizens before 而且以後還會繼續傷害下去 And they'll continue to harm them in the future 所以說不能再給自由黨機會了 So we can't give the Liberal Party another chance 現在屬於保守黨的偉大時代 即將到來 Now, the great era of the Conservative Party is about to arrive 如果您有興趣的話 If you're interested 您可以關注一下 You can follow 最近 Recently 保守黨發佈的這些公開的聲明 The public statements released by the Conservative Party 新聞的報導 News reports 以及在x社區中 And in the X community 發佈的這些競選活動時候的一些觀點 Some of the views expressed during campaign events 都提到了我前面說的這個意思 All mention what I said earlier 就是說不能再給自由黨任何機會了 That we can't give the Liberal Party any more chances 好 前面說的 Alright, what I said earlier 就是第一個自由黨民調反彈的原因 Is the first reason for the Liberal Party's polling rebound 就是特魯多辭職 Which is Trudeau's resignation 造成的自由黨重啟現象 Causing the Liberal Party restart phenomenon 自由黨民調逆勢上揚 The Liberal Party's polling surge against the odds 第二個原因 The second reason 這個是一個外因 This is an external factor 就是特朗普的關稅威脅 Which is Trump's tariff threats 那近期特朗普對加拿大的威脅 Recently, Trump's threats against Canada 大家是有目共睹 Are plain for all to see 那不僅要求加拿大成為美國第51個州 Not only demanding that Canada become the 51st state of the U.S. 而且通過接連不斷的關稅恐嚇 But also through relentless tariff intimidation 試圖對加拿大的經濟和就業造成衝擊 Attempting to impact Canada's economy and employment 來逼迫加拿大在談判桌上就範 To force Canada to yield at the negotiating table 然後自由黨就利用特朗普的威脅 Then the Liberal Party seized on Trump's threats 就開始成功的發話了 And successfully started speaking out 說自由黨 Saying that the Liberal Party 曾經有過成功阻擊特朗普的先例 Has a precedent of successfully resisting Trump 那是在特朗普第一任期的時候 That was during Trump's first term 自由黨政府當時面對特朗普的關稅威脅 The Liberal government at the time faced Trump's tariff threats 派出了一個談判代表團 And sent a negotiating team 唇槍舌劍 Engaging in fierce verbal battles 據理力爭 Arguing with reason and determination 從2017年的8月份 From August 2017 一直談到2018年10月份 All the way to October 2018 如果再算上後期的這個調整 And if you include the later adjustments 那一直持續到2019年的年底 It lasted until the end of 2019 可以說這是一個非常艱鉅的任務 You could say it was a very arduous task 最後加拿大是成功的阻擊了特朗普 In the end, Canada successfully fended off Trump 跟美國政府 With the U.S. government 還有墨西哥政府 And the Mexican government 簽署了一個USMCA美加墨協議 Signing the USMCA agreement 取代了之前的NAFTA Replacing the previous NAFTA 在這場曠日持久的談判中 In this protracted negotiation 代表團裡面的成員 The members of the delegation 尤其是方慧蘭 Especially Chrystia Freeland 那表現可以說是定海神針 可圈可點 Performed like a stabilizing force, truly impressive 為加拿大又爭了面子 Earning Canada both prestige 又爭了裏子 And tangible benefits 同時 At the same time 也成為了 She also became 特朗普最不喜歡的加拿大政客之一 One of the Canadian politicians Trump disliked the most 這個也可以理解 This is understandable 本來特朗普就是想忽悠一下 Trump originally just wanted to bluff 嚇唬嚇唬加拿大 就能拿到甜頭 Scare Canada into giving him some advantages 沒想到這個 But he didn't expect 這方慧蘭這位 This Chrystia Freeland 錙銖必較 To be so meticulous 跟你死磕到底 And fight him to the end 最後特朗普自己也覺得沒意思 In the end, Trump himself got tired of it 於是 So 就簽了一個自己4年之後又想反悔的 He signed an agreement he wanted to back out of four years later 讓自己非常不滿意的這麼一個協議 A deal he was very dissatisfied with 所以說你看 So you see 咱們不得不承認 We have to admit 儘管現在 Although now 2024年到2025年期間的自由黨政府 The Liberal government from 2024 to 2025 渾身上下都是問題 Is riddled with problems 但是把時間放回到七年前的 But if we rewind seven years 2017年到2018年的時候 To 2017 and 2018 咱們不得不承認 We have to admit 那個時候的自由黨身上 The Liberal Party back then 還是有些活力的 Still had some vitality 尤其是在對外談判這一塊 Especially in foreign negotiations 以方慧蘭為代表的加拿大談判代表團 The Canadian negotiating team led by Chrystia Freeland 的確是能力出眾 Was indeed highly capable 在外交經濟和政治三方面 In diplomacy, economics, and politics 都顯示出全能的戰鬥力 Showing all-around strength 而保守黨的這方面就顯得這個 While the Conservative Party in this regard seems 怎麼說 How should I put it 當然保守黨也許會做的更好 Of course, the Conservatives might do better 這得說清楚 Let's be clear about that 但是當時因為沒有給他們表現機會 But back then, they didn't get a chance to prove it 大家也不知道 So no one knows 保守黨裡面 Within the Conservative Party 到底有誰能夠跟方慧蘭媲美 Who could rival Chrystia Freeland 這麼一個政治強人 Such a political heavyweight 現在這一批保守黨的政治家們 The current batch of Conservative politicians 大家好像除了這個博勵治 It seems people only know Pierre Poilievre 和這個前兩任的黨魁 And the previous two leaders 奧圖爾和安德魯希爾之外 Erin O'Toole and Andrew Scheer 好像也不認識什麼其他的 But don't seem to know many other 有能力的保守黨的明星人物 Capable Conservative Party stars 也許是我孤陋寡聞吧 Maybe I'm just out of the loop 但至少曝光度不太夠 But at least their exposure isn't enough 於是就導致現在這麼一個現象 So it's led to this current phenomenon 民眾現在雖然對自由黨感到厭倦 Although the public is tired of the Liberal Party 可是面對特朗普 When facing Trump 大家覺得 People feel 目前最緊急的事 The most urgent matter right now 還是需要一致對外 Is to unite against an external threat 還是找一個比較靠譜的談判團隊 And find a reliable negotiating team 來把特朗普給懟回去 To push back against Trump 這個才是當務之急 That's the top priority 至於其他的那些 As for the other issues 可以緩一緩 They can wait 於是這個談判專家方慧蘭 So this negotiation expert, Chrystia Freeland 加上經濟大拿馬克.卡尼 Paired with economic heavyweight Mark Carney 這對黃金組合 This golden duo 也就自然而然的 Naturally 成為了加拿大老百姓們可以指望的 Became something Canadian citizens can rely on 對付特朗普的最佳利器 As the best weapon against Trump 那作用堪比倚天劍 Its effect is like the Sword of Heaven 屠龍刀火尖槍 The Dragon-Slaying Saber, the Fire-Tipped Spear 風火輪乾坤圈混天綾 The Wind Fire Wheels, the Universe Ring, the Chaos Silk 金箍棒人間大砲 The Golden Staff, the Human Cannon 至少用起來感覺比較放心 At least it feels reassuring to use 這個咱們也不瞎說 We're not just making this up 咱們數字說話 Let's let the numbers talk 根據Nanos的一項民意調查顯示 According to a Nanos poll 40%的加拿大人 40% of Canadians 更喜歡由馬克.卡尼組成的自由黨團隊 Prefer a Liberal team led by Mark Carney 跟特朗普去談判 To negotiate with Trump 而不是博勵治 Over Pierre Poilievre 而支持博勵治去跟特朗普談的只有26% While only 26% support Poilievre negotiating with Trump 而且還有一個事情 And there's another thing 讓博勵治感到被背刺一刀 That makes Poilievre feel stabbed in the back 就是政治方面的聯想 Which is political association 這個什麼意思 What does that mean? 你看看 Look 特朗普在美國代表的是右翼的力量 Trump represents the right-wing forces in the U.S. 於是大家自然而然的 So naturally, people 就會把他跟加拿大的右翼黨派 Associate him with Canada's right-wing party 混為一談 Lumping them together 認為你博勵治跟特朗普是一夥的 Thinking that you, Poilievre, are in the same camp as Trump 右翼幫助右翼嘛 Right-wing helping right-wing, right? 那麼談判的時候 So during negotiations 那保不齊保守黨會出賣加拿大的利益 Who's to say the Conservatives won't sell out Canada's interests? 是吧 Right? 而且還有更極端的人 And there are even more extreme people 把對特朗普的憤怒 Who take their anger toward Trump 遷怒于博勵治所代表的加拿大保守黨 And redirect it at the Canadian Conservative Party led by Poilievre 就覺得 Feeling that 你博勵治肯定跟特朗普是一丘之貉 You, Poilievre, must be cut from the same cloth as Trump 這就是為什麼 This is why 當特朗普的關稅大棒一砸下來 When Trump swings his tariff stick 加拿大保守黨的支持率 The Canadian Conservative Party's support rate 立馬掉下來好幾個百分點 Immediately drops by several percentage points 其實說實話 To be honest 博勵治也挺冤的 Poilievre is pretty unfairly treated 你殊不知 You may not realize 加拿大的右翼政黨 Canada's right-wing party 他跟美國的右翼政黨 And the U.S.'s right-wing party 完全不是一回事 Are not the same thing at all 在整體政治氛圍完全偏左的加拿大 In Canada, where the overall political climate leans heavily left 把加拿大的右翼政黨拎出來放在美國 If you took Canada's right-wing party and put it in the U.S. 有可能比美國的左派民主黨還左 It might be even more left-wing than the U.S. Democratic Party 但是老百姓不管這個 But the public doesn't care about that 看到特朗普就想起博勵治 Seeing Trump reminds them of Poilievre 這中間的政治聯想 This political association 搞得博勵治自己也是叫苦不迭 Has left Poilievre himself complaining bitterly 所以說您看 So you see 最近一段時間 Recently 這博勵治就頻頻出來講話 Poilievre has been speaking out frequently 把自己作為加拿大的代言人 Positioning himself as Canada's spokesperson 表明自己要為加拿大人民說話 Stating that he will speak for the Canadian people 要堅定捍衛加拿大的利益 And staunchly defend Canada's interests 要跟特朗普硬剛 To stand firm against Trump 我們加拿大 We Canadians 絶對不會成為美國的第51個州 Will absolutely not become the 51st state of the U.S. 你看 Look 說的全是這種非常強硬的講話 It's all very tough rhetoric 實際上就是利用民族主義情緒 In reality, it's about leveraging nationalist sentiment 來鞏固自己的基本盤 To solidify his base 把博勵治給塑造成帶領加拿大人民 Shaping Poilievre into a leader of the Canadian people 抵禦美國侵略的一個捍衛者的形象 A defender against American aggression 這個也沒辦法 There's no other choice 但凡他話說的稍微軟一點 If his words were even slightly softer 就有可能會把他跟特朗普粘在一起 It could link him to Trump 所以說 So 為了撇清自己跟特朗普的關係 To distance himself from Trump 他其實也是挺拼的 He's really putting in a lot of effort 你們老百姓恨特朗普沒問題 It's fine if you citizens hate Trump 你別恨我 是吧？我招誰惹誰了 But don't hate me, right? Who did I provoke? 但是 But 保守黨在宣揚自己的愛國主義的同時 While the Conservatives promote their patriotism 它也敏鋭的注意到了對面自由黨 They've also keenly noticed the Liberal Party opposite them 有可能會利用這次特朗普的關稅威脅 Might use Trump's tariff threats this time 引發的這麼一個反右情緒 To spark an anti-right-wing sentiment 有可能會擺脫保守黨的圍追堵截 Potentially breaking free from the Conservatives' encirclement 你看保守黨這麼聰明 See how smart the Conservatives are 肯定不會讓這事發生 They definitely won't let that happen 於是他近期也是加大廣告力度 So recently, they've ramped up their advertising efforts 不斷的把自由黨通過外交努力 Constantly pulling the Liberals' temporary public support gained through diplomacy 獲得的短暫民意支持 Back down 拽回到之前 To the reality of 被自由黨搞得一團糟的內政現實中來 The domestic mess the Liberals created before 適當的提醒老百姓們不要健忘 Reminding the public not to forget 不要忘了高昂的房價 Don't forget the sky-high housing prices 不要忘了可怕的通貨膨脹 Don't forget the terrifying inflation 不要忘了超高的犯罪率 Don't forget the soaring crime rates 不要忘了毒品橫行 Don't forget the rampant drugs 流浪漢滿街 And streets full of homeless people 說白了就是不能讓自由黨跑了 In short, they can't let the Liberals off the hook 好 這就是咱們前面說的 Alright, this is what we mentioned earlier 自由黨民調反彈的第二個原因 The second reason for the Liberal Party's polling rebound 就是特朗普的神助攻 Which is Trump's unintentional assist 自由黨民調逆勢上揚 The Liberal Party's polling surge against the odds 還有第三個理由 There's also a third reason 就是重置之後的自由黨 Which is that the reset Liberal Party 他及時進行了政策調整 Made timely policy adjustments 有效地降低了選民的敵意 Effectively reducing voter hostility 這一點 This point 其實大家在本週一和本週二的兩場 Actually, everyone can see it in the two 自由黨黨魁的辯論中 Liberal Party leadership debates this Monday and Tuesday 也可以看到 You can also observe 在很多議題上 On many issues 這幾位候選人 These candidates 不是說梗著脖子死不悔改 Aren't stubbornly refusing to admit mistakes 堅持說自己沒做錯 Insisting they did nothing wrong 我們還要堅持特魯多的政策 That we should stick to Trudeau's policies 100年不動搖 Unwavering for 100 years 沒人敢這麼說話的 No one dares to talk like that 而是反過來 Instead, on the contrary 都不約而同的 They've all unanimously 在不同程度上 To varying degrees 規避了特魯多政府之前 Avoided the Trudeau government's previous 引發民怨沸騰的那麼幾項重大政策 Major policies that sparked widespread public discontent 都紛紛表明自己將會有所改變 All indicating they'll make changes 並且說的時候 And when they say it 把這個姿態放的很低 They adopt a very humble stance 強調說我們現在要傾聽民意 Emphasizing that they'll listen to the public now 而且我們也聽到了你們的意見 And that they've heard your opinions 我們會好好的改正自己的錯誤 And will earnestly correct their mistakes 你看這种放低身段的做法 Look at this approach of lowering their posture 其實非常聰明 It's actually very clever 他不僅在很大程度上 It not only largely 把自己跟特魯多政府之前的這個政策 Distances themselves from the Trudeau government's previous policies 切割了開來 Cutting ties with them 而且 And 用感情牌來暖化老百姓們冰凍的內心 Uses an emotional appeal to thaw the frozen hearts of the public 其實加拿大老百姓們還是挺善良的 In fact, Canadian citizens are pretty kind-hearted 看到你們自由黨既然認識到了錯誤 Seeing that the Liberals have acknowledged their mistakes 也就不太好意思趕盡殺絶 They're not so keen on pushing them to the brink 自由黨民調逆勢上揚 The Liberal Party's polling surge against the odds 第四個原因 The fourth reason 就是 Is that 自由黨利用了一個跟特魯多舊有的政策 The Liberal Party leveraged someone completely detached from Trudeau's old policies 切割的乾乾淨淨 Cleanly separated 井水不犯河水 With no overlap 八竿子打不著的 Totally unrelated 從未在特魯多內閣中擔任職務的新人 A newcomer who never served in Trudeau's cabinet 馬克.卡尼 Mark Carney 利用他的強大經濟背景 Using his strong economic background 和國際金融經驗 And international financial experience 給加拿大選民們畫了一個大餅 Painting a grand vision for Canadian voters 送了一個期待 Offering a sense of hope 讓選民們期待 Making voters anticipate 自由黨能夠在新黨魁的帶領下 That the Liberal Party, under a new leader 重振加拿大的經濟 Can revitalize Canada's economy 反擊特朗普的關稅威脅 And counter Trump's tariff threats 並且自由黨非常聰明的把這個期待 And the Liberals very cleverly turned this expectation 在兩場自由黨的黨魁辯論中 In the two Liberal leadership debates 不斷灌輸給選民 Constantly instilling it in voters 把選民們的胃口給弔的高高的 Whetting the voters' appetites sky-high 讓這種期待不斷的發酵 Letting this anticipation continue to ferment 這裡面 In this context 咱們就順便說一下 Let's briefly mention 這個本週一 This Monday 本週二 And Tuesday 舉行的這兩場自由黨黨魁的辯論 The two Liberal Party leadership debates held 週一是法語辯論 Monday was the French debate 週二是英語辯論 Tuesday was the English debate 雖說 Although 它只是一個自由黨黨內的黨魁選舉 It's just an internal Liberal Party leadership election 不是全國大選 Not a national election 但是 But 他也迅速吸引了全國老百姓的注意力 It quickly captured the attention of the entire nation's citizens 於是自由黨 So the Liberal Party 利用了這次黨魁辯論所聚攏的人氣 Capitalized on the popularity gathered from this leadership debate 迅速而且有效的 Quickly and effectively 全力以赴的為下一任這位黨魁 Went all out to promote the next party leader 進行了大力的包裝 Packaging them heavily 讓他擺脫特魯多的陰影 Helping them break free from Trudeau's shadow 用一個柔軟的身段 With a softer approach 對加拿大的老百姓們 Toward Canadian citizens 發動一個魅力攻勢 Launching a charm offensive 你看在這個週一的法語辯論中 Look at this Monday's French debate 這4位候選人 These four candidates 因為是初次亮相嘛 Since it was their first appearance 也沒有發揮太好 Didn't perform too well 而且話題也沒有展開 And the topics weren't fully explored 他們討論的重點 Their focus of discussion 也還是放在 Was still placed on 美國對加拿大即將發動的關稅戰上面 The looming tariff war the U.S. is about to wage against Canada 也沒有涉及到太多的什麼國內政治 Without delving too much into domestic politics 而且在法語辯論中 And in the French debate 大家明顯感覺關係比較融洽 It was clear that the atmosphere was relatively harmonious 合作多於分歧 With more cooperation than disagreement 也沒有進行任何人身的攻擊 And no personal attacks were made 甚至當某些候選人出現失誤的時候 Even when some candidates made mistakes 其他候選人 Other candidates 還幫助救場的這個奇葩景象 Even stepped in to help, which was quite an odd sight 這個大家肯定知道我說的是誰 Everyone surely knows who I'm talking about 就是我在上期節目中 It's the one I expressed concern about in the last episode 對他的法語水平表示擔憂的 Regarding his French proficiency 這位馬克.卡尼先生 This Mr. Mark Carney 你看週一的法語辯論現場 Look at the scene of Monday's French debate 他果然表現不好 He indeed didn't perform well 在討論這個加沙議題中 During the discussion on the Gaza issue 他本來想說 He originally meant to say 我同意之前 I agree with the previous 我們關於譴責哈馬斯的共識 Consensus we had on condemning Hamas 結果嘴一瓢 But he slipped up 就說成了我們同意哈馬斯 And said, “We agree with Hamas” 搞得方慧蘭趕緊下場幫助他圓回來 Prompting Chrystia Freeland to quickly step in and smooth it over 看到這 Seeing this 有人說這個方慧蘭 Some people say, “This Chrystia Freeland 你為什麼不趁機落井下石 Why didn't you take the chance to kick him while he's down 踩一腳 And step on him 這位卡尼 This Carney 畢竟是你方慧蘭 After all, you, Freeland 在黨內的最強競爭者 Are his strongest competitor in the party” 這個 不能踩一腳 This—she couldn't step on him 其實您估計也看出來了 Actually, you've probably figured it out 雖說一開始 Although at first 這個方慧蘭還真的有打算跟卡尼競爭 Freeland did intend to compete with Carney 但是估計幾週下來 But after a few weeks 她自己也洩氣了 She probably lost steam 自己也感覺到跟卡尼爭奪黨魁 And realized that vying for the leadership against Carney 這個不太現實 Wasn't very realistic 於是她就退而求其次 So she settled for the next best thing 跟卡尼搞好關係 Building a good relationship with Carney 以後能夠在卡尼的內閣中 So she could later secure 擔任一個重要職位 An important position in Carney's cabinet 那才是比較務實的選擇 That's the more pragmatic choice 而且這個我猜 And I'm guessing 他們自由黨內部肯定也溝通過了 The Liberal Party internally must have discussed this 目前全黨最重要的任務不是內耗 Right now, the party's top priority isn't internal conflict 而是集中力量 But rather uniting their efforts 讓馬克.卡尼和特魯多完成切割 To fully separate Mark Carney from Trudeau 同時把卡尼給包裝成挑戰特朗普 While packaging Carney as the one to challenge Trump 拯救加拿大人民的大救星 And save the Canadian people as a great savior 把他送上黨魁的位置 Propelling him to the party leadership 扶上馬送一程 Helping him up and giving him a push 這才是目前自由黨 That's the Liberal Party's current 最迫切需要完成的第一任務 Most urgent primary task 而不是您看到的 Not what you might see 好像競選挺激烈的窩裡鬥 As an intense internal fight in the campaign 那個是虛晃一槍而已 That's just a feint 而且還有個證據 And there's evidence 你看 Look 上週他們不是把本來是5個候選人嗎 Last week, didn't they have five candidates originally? 把裡面這位印度裔的盧比.達拉 They kicked out this Indian-origin candidate, Ruby Dhalla 給踢出去了 Got rid of her 為什麼 Why? 那還不就是因為 Isn't it because 盧比.達拉所奉行的執政理念 The governing philosophy Ruby Dhalla followed 她是徹徹底底的保守黨的政策 Was thoroughly Conservative Party policy 甚至有些政策比保守黨還要右 Some of her policies were even more right-wing than the Conservatives' 甚至有很多自由黨人 Even many Liberals 把盧比.達拉稱為加拿大的女版特朗普 Called Ruby Dhalla Canada's female version of Trump 你說像盧比.達拉這麼一個人 For someone like Ruby Dhalla 讓她參選 Letting her run 這不是妥妥的搬起石頭砸自己的腳嗎 Wouldn't that be like lifting a rock just to drop it on their own feet? 於是自由黨內部 So the Liberal Party internally 一討論 After a discussion 就找了一大堆這個非常牽強的理由 Came up with a bunch of very flimsy excuses 在距離黨魁辯論還剩一週的時候 With just one week left before the leadership debate 把這個盧比.達拉給踢出去了 Kicked Ruby Dhalla out 而且 And 還是在盧比.達拉接受電視採訪的時候 It happened while Ruby Dhalla was doing a TV interview 在節目現場 Live on the show 通過節目主持人 Through the show's host 才知道自己被踢出去了 She found out she'd been removed 可以說 欺負人欺負到家了 You could say they really took bullying to the extreme 把這個盧比.達拉給氣的 Angering Ruby Dhalla so much 說是要起訴 That she said she'd sue 至於這起訴能不能贏 As for whether this lawsuit can win 怎麼可能贏 How could it possibly win? 加拿大這些政黨 These Canadian parties 他黨內的政治規則 Their internal political rules 其實就是領導層的一言堂 Are basically the leadership's say-so 他們商量著辦 They decide among themselves 黨內民主 Party democracy 那只不過是給給外人做做樣子看的 Is just something they show outsiders for appearances 所以說您明白了這一點 So once you understand this 你也就可以理解 You can also understand 為什麼當馬克.卡尼出現嘴瓢的時候 Why, when Mark Carney slipped up 方慧蘭會幫助他救場 Chrystia Freeland stepped in to help him 其實 Actually 你要說法語水平的話 If we're talking about French proficiency 方慧蘭自己的法語 Freeland's own French 也遠遠沒有達到母語般的流利程度 Is far from native-level fluency 但是不影響交流 But it doesn't hinder communication 他的語法也沒有錯誤 And her grammar is error-free 而且法語的發揮也比較穩定 Plus, her French performance is relatively consistent 其實這4個候選人中 Actually, among these four candidates 法語最好的 The best at French 是那位 Is that 出生在魁北克蒙特利爾的 One born in Montreal, Quebec 弗蘭克.貝利斯 本地人嘛 Frank Baylis, a local 但是實在是因為 But really because 他自己的提出的政策沒有什麼亮點 The policies he proposed lack any highlights 就使得他在法語辯論中 It meant that in the French debate 本該應該有的優勢 The advantage he should have had 也沒發揮出來 Didn't come through 他的風頭 His spotlight 反而被那個英語是母語的那位 Was instead stolen by the one whose native language is English 卡琳娜.古爾德女士 Ms. Karina Gould 給蓋了過去 Who overshadowed him 在第一場法語辯論 In the first French debate 媒體普遍認為 The media generally believes 表現最好的就是這位卡琳娜.古爾德 The best performer was Karina Gould 她的那種怎麼說 Her—what should I say— 和年齡不相稱的穩重和成熟 Maturity and steadiness beyond her years 使得她在第一場辯論賽中大放異彩 Made her shine brightly in the first debate 她就是把自己定位成 She positioned herself as 一位注重可負擔性和進步的價值觀的 A leader focused on affordability and progressive values 一位具有前瞻性的領導者 A forward-thinking leader 不過 However 古爾德女士 Ms. Gould 雖然表現不錯 Though she performed well 但是這並沒有引發太大的民調變動 It didn't cause much of a shift in the polls 畢竟她想超過馬克.卡尼 After all, surpassing Mark Carney 其實難度是非常大的 Is actually very difficult 因為她吸引的主要是年輕人 Because she mainly attracts younger voters 在年紀大的人看來 In the eyes of older people 她的這種過于自信 Her overconfidence 反而是一種 Instead comes off as 沒有經歷過現實打擊 Someone untested by the harsh realities 和嚴酷的政治考驗 And tough political trials 在象牙塔裡面 From an ivory tower 誇誇其談的這個盲目自信罷了 Just blind confidence from empty talk 然後在第二天週二 Then on Tuesday, the next day 舉行的這個英語黨魁辯論中 In the English leadership debate 這個馬克.卡尼就恢復了狀態 Mark Carney regained his form 而且被評為辯論中 And was rated as the 表現最出色的一位候選人 Most outstanding candidate in the debate 他迅速從第一場法語辯論的失誤中 He quickly recovered from his slip-up in the first French debate 恢復過來 Bouncing back 充分利用了自己 Fully leveraging his 在經濟方面的專業知識 Expertise in economics 以及曾經帶領加拿大 And his record of leading Canada 對抗2008年的金融危機 Through the 2008 financial crisis 這麼一個光榮的履歷 Such a prestigious résumé 給大家畫了一個大餅 Painting a grand vision for everyone 意思就是說 The gist being 只要加拿大的經濟在他的帶領下 As long as Canada's economy thrives under his leadership 得到了發展 And develops 其他所有的經濟以外的問題 All other non-economic issues 都不是問題 Won't be problems 特朗普也不是問題 Trump won't be a problem either 就是這麼牛 That's how impressive he is 在英語辯論中 In the English debate 表現第二好的 就是方慧蘭 The second-best performer was Chrystia Freeland 方慧蘭在這場辯論賽中 Freeland in this debate 給人的印象也是很深的 Left a strong impression 她拿來說事 She brought up 就是她曾經參與過美加墨協議 Her involvement in the USMCA negotiations USMCA的談判工作 The USMCA talks 她知道如何對付特朗普 She knows how to handle Trump 於是就把自己成功塑造成了一個 So she successfully shaped herself into 經過特朗普考驗過的 A negotiator tested by Trump 談判代表的形象 A representative with negotiation credentials 就是充分利用了特朗普 Fully capitalizing on Trump 給加拿大人民帶來的恐慌 And the panic he's caused among Canadians 來給自己加分 To boost her own standing 除了他倆之外 Besides the two of them 另外兩位 The other two 卡琳娜.古爾德主攻的是青年選民 Karina Gould targeted young voters 她要代表青年人推動社會進步 She wants to represent the youth to push for social progress 就給人感覺激情有餘 Giving the impression of plenty of passion 熱情也有 And enthusiasm too 但是不夠沉穩 But lacking in steadiness 而且也沒有經驗 And also lacking experience 尤其是那句 我覺得不舒服 Especially that line, “I feel uncomfortable” 就是她說她自己是唯一的一位 When she said she's the only one 做好了準備 迎接特朗普挑戰的候選人 Prepared to take on the Trump challenge 就讓人感覺就不太靠譜 It just didn't feel very credible 你是唯一做好準備挑戰特朗普的 You're the only one ready to challenge Trump? 你用什麼挑戰 What are you going to challenge him with? 你用嘴炮的方式還是用撓的方式 With words or with scratches? 話不能這麼說 You can't talk like that 自信是好事 Confidence is a good thing 但是你沒什麼過硬的本事 But if you don't have solid skills 又過于自信 And you're overly confident 就招人討厭了 It becomes off-putting 最後這位弗蘭克貝里斯 Lastly, this Frank Baylis 你別說 長得挺精神的 To be fair, he looks pretty sharp 這個這說實話 Honestly 我覺得他有點像奧巴馬 I think he looks a bit like Obama 和那個Kevin Costner And Kevin Costner 這麼一個結合體 A combination of the two 但是長得精神沒用 But looking sharp isn't enough 他明顯就是一個陪太子讀書的人 He's clearly just there to fill a spot 要人脈沒人脈 No connections 要資歷沒資歷 No credentials 唯一拿的出手的 The only thing he can boast about 就是他曾經在商業方面有豐富的經驗 Is his rich experience in business 但是他這些所謂的商業經驗 But that so-called business experience 在馬克.卡尼面前就就好比一個 In front of Mark Carney is like 怎麼說 How should I put it 就好比一個剛上學的小學生 Like a kid just starting school 跟一位職業拳擊手去去打擂台一樣 Facing off against a professional boxer in the ring 跟卡尼比 Compared to Carney 他一點優勢都沒有 He has no edge at all 而且他在辯論中的表現也是 And his performance in the debate was 中規中矩 Pretty average 沒有什麼特別讓人難忘的觀點 No particularly memorable viewpoints 以及給選民帶來任何的期望 Or anything to inspire voter expectations 所以說 So 他民調墊底其實也很正常 It's no surprise he's at the bottom of the polls 所以說 你看 So, you see 這也不是巧合 This isn't a coincidence 這幾位選手在黨魁辯論中的表現 The performance of these candidates in the leadership debates 基本上跟他們的民調數字保持一致 Basically aligns with their poll numbers 排名第一的卡尼 Carney, ranked first 繼續鞏固自己的領先優勢 Continues to solidify his lead 排名第二的方慧蘭 Freeland, ranked second 和排名第三的古爾德緊隨其後 And Gould, ranked third, close behind 排名最後的弗蘭克.貝利斯 Frank Baylis, ranked last 繼續保持掉隊打狼的位置 Continues to lag behind 用一句話總結 卡尼靠專業知識 In one sentence: Carney relies on expertise 方慧蘭靠談判經驗 Freeland relies on negotiation experience 古爾德靠這個描繪願景 Gould relies on painting a vision 貝利斯靠靠... Baylis relies on… well… 他就靠邊站 He's just on the sidelines 整個就是一個局外人 Completely an outsider 也沒什麼可說的 With nothing much to say 然後咱們再看看 Then let's take a look 這4位黨魁候選人 At how these four leadership candidates 在面對選民們 When facing voters 提出來的各種刁鑽問題的時候 And their tough questions 都是怎麼表現的 How they performed 總體來說 Overall 這4位候選人的表現都是各有亮點 All four candidates had their highlights 中規中矩 And were fairly standard 除了卡尼在第一場法語辯論中 Except for Carney in the first French debate 談到哈馬斯的時候 When talking about Hamas 出了一點小意外之外 Had a little slip-up 其他時間 大家發揮都很正常 Other than that, everyone performed normally 當然 時間關係 Of course, due to time constraints 他們都具體怎麼回答的 How they specifically answered 這個我就詳細不說了 I won't go into detail about that 這個你有興趣的話 If you're interested 可以到網上回看一下 You can watch the replay online 這個辯論的回放 The debate replay 網上到處都是 Is all over the internet 咱們今天只是重點點評一下 Today, we'll just focus on reviewing 自由黨 How the Liberal Party 是如何利用這場全國矚目的黨魁辯論 Used this nationally watched leadership debate 來輓救自己的聲譽的 To salvage its reputation 您肯定注意到了 You've surely noticed 在兩場辯論的大部分時間 For most of the two debates 所有的候選人們都是在盡最大的努力 All the candidates were doing their utmost 把自己跟特魯多的政策切割開來 To distance themselves from Trudeau's policies 但是大家又不約而同地 But they all, without exception 避免直接批評特魯多 Avoided directly criticizing Trudeau 避免對特魯多進行任何的言語攻擊 Avoided any verbal attacks on Trudeau 如果有任何涉及到特魯多的問題 If any questions related to Trudeau came up 他們也都會非常謹慎的回答 They would answer very cautiously 因為之前你看特魯多的很多政策 Because, as you've seen, many of Trudeau's policies 他們都是參與過的 They were involved in 如何做到又要切割 How to both distance themselves 又不能完全否定過去的政策 And not completely deny past policies 因為否定過去就是否定自己嘛 Since denying the past is denying themselves 這裡面其實是非常考驗情商的 This really tests their emotional intelligence 所以說 So 這些人的基本話術就是 Their basic rhetoric is 我們願意傾聽老百姓的意見 We're willing to listen to the public's opinions 而且我們也聽到了 And we've heard them 我們也願意改 We're willing to change 我們願意改那些你們不喜歡的政策 We'll change the policies you don't like 改善老百姓們在生活中遇到的痛點 And address the pain points in people's lives 而且我們也有辦法 And we have the means 也有能力帶領大家應對美國的威脅 And the ability to lead everyone in facing America's threats 雖說之前特魯多政府做了不少錯誤的決策 Although the Trudeau government made quite a few wrong decisions 但是人非聖賢孰能無過 But no one's perfect—who doesn't make mistakes? 哪個政府沒有犯過錯誤 Which government hasn't made errors? 有過能改 If there's a mistake and it's corrected 善莫大焉 That's the greatest virtue 而且話說回來 And speaking of which 特魯多政府也不是全幹壞事 The Trudeau government didn't only do bad things 也做過一些好事 It did some good things too 這些好的政治遺產 These positive political legacies 我們不能扔掉 We can't throw away 等等等等 And so on and so forth 大致就是這麼一個說話風格 That's roughly their style of speaking 既要強調尊重老百姓的意見 Emphasizing respect for public opinion 也要引導老百姓向前看 While guiding people to look forward 就是把特魯多拋在腦後 Putting Trudeau behind us 咱們向前看 Let's look ahead 至於拿什麼吸引老百姓向前看 As for what will draw people to look forward 就是這位馬克.卡尼先生 It's this Mr. Mark Carney 我們的這個重新啟動了之後 Our rebooted 涅槃重生的自由黨政府 Reborn-from-the-ashes Liberal government 隆重推出的下一代新領袖 Proudly presenting the next generation's new leader 我們要把注意力全部放到他的身上 We need to focus all our attention on him 說著說著 Keep talking like this 你要是總這麼說的話 If you keep saying it 大家不就是忘掉特魯多了嗎 Won't everyone just forget about Trudeau? 於是 So 你看這自由黨的媒體就是火力全開 The Liberal media is going all out 天天報導 天天說 Reporting every day, saying it every day 每天在你耳朵邊上說 Buzzing in your ears every day 卡尼是經濟專家 Carney is an economic expert 金融大咖 A financial heavyweight 商業奇才 A business genius 世界明星 A global star 又是精英 An elite 又是學霸 A top scholar 又有全球背景 With a global background 在世界範圍內可以積攢大量的人脈 Able to build a vast network worldwide 可以幫助加拿大 Can help Canada 獲得來自世界的各種援助 Gain various forms of support from around the world 可以對抗特朗普的關稅大棒 Can counter Trump's tariff stick 就給人感覺 It gives the impression 這個馬克.卡尼 That this Mark Carney 他不是卡尼 Isn't just Carney 他是南海觀世音 He's the Guanyin of the South Sea 他是拯救加拿大的大救星 He's Canada's great savior 但是甭管自由黨說的對不對 But whether what the Liberals say is true or not 但是你架不住天天說 You can't resist them saying it every day 說著說著 你也就信了 Keep saying it, and you'll start believing it 因此說針對自由黨這種全力以赴的 So, in response to the Liberals' all-out effort 為下任黨魁進行全新包裝的行動策略 To repackage the next party leader 保守黨的博勵治 The Conservatives' Pierre Poilievre 那猴精猴精的 看的非常清楚 Who's sharp as a tack, sees it very clearly 而且他也是一貫主打自己反對體制 And he's always played the anti-establishment 反對精英的人設 Anti-elite persona 你自由黨那邊給我推出一個精英來 You Liberals are pushing an elite at me 那不打你打誰 Who else would I target if not you? 於是就看這個 So look at this 博勵治帶領的保守黨所做出的反擊 The counterattack led by Poilievre's Conservatives 就是人身攻擊 Which is personal attacks 而且是集中火力攻擊 And focused, concentrated attacks 攻擊這位自由黨黨魁 Targeting the Liberal Party leader 最有可能的獲勝者 Most likely to win 馬克.卡尼先生 Mr. Mark Carney 這個大家最近也看到了 Everyone's seen this recently 最近在電視上 Lately on TV 油管上 On YouTube 社交媒體上 On social media 不斷看到 You keep seeing 保守黨在給馬克.卡尼貼標籤 The Conservatives labeling Mark Carney 叫碳稅卡尼 Calling him “Carbon Tax Carney” Carbon Tax Carney 你看他們說方慧蘭了嗎 Did they mention Freeland? 說那個卡琳娜.古爾德了嗎 Did they mention Karina Gould? 說弗蘭克.貝利斯了嗎 Did they mention Frank Baylis? 都沒有 No, they didn't 就抓住卡尼一個人使勁咬 They're just biting down hard on Carney alone 這叫什麼 What's this called? 這叫射人先射馬 It's called “shoot the horse before the rider” 擒賊先擒王 “Capture the king to catch the thieves” 就是強行把卡尼 Forcing Carney 跟特魯多不受歡迎的碳稅政策 To be tied to Trudeau's unpopular carbon tax policy 綁定在一起 Binding them together 即使卡尼反覆在辯論中強調 Even though Carney repeatedly emphasized in the debates 自己是要取消碳稅的 That he wants to abolish the carbon tax 但是你說不好使 But saying it doesn't work 現在是我們保守黨在說 Now it's the Conservatives doing the talking 在保守黨的眼中 In the Conservatives' eyes 你卡尼就是碳稅 You, Carney, are the carbon tax 就差在你臉上寫著“碳稅”兩個字了 They might as well write “carbon tax” on your face 而且 你卡尼也不是救世主 And you, Carney, aren't a savior 你也不是觀世音 You're not Guanyin 你是牛魔王 You're the Bull Demon King 你也不是大救星 You're not a great savior 你是大災星 You're a great disaster 您看 在這個碳稅卡尼的廣告中 Look, in this “Carbon Tax Carney” ad 整個屏幕用的是暗紅色的背景 The entire screen uses a dark red background 再搭配幾張卡尼的醜照 Paired with a few unflattering photos of Carney 把這個人身攻擊給做到了極致 Taking this personal attack to the extreme 就是說自由黨這邊 In other words, the Liberal Party 在全力幫助卡尼跟特魯多切割 Is全力trying to help Carney distance himself from Trudeau 而保守黨這邊 While the Conservative Party 是不斷的把卡尼跟特魯多綁定在一起 Keeps tying Carney to Trudeau 而且是深度綁定 And doing it deeply 你想跑沒門 You can't escape 另外這個博勵治的團隊 Also, Poilievre's team 也敏鋭的抓住了 Keenly seized on 卡尼這次在法語辯論中 Carney's slip-up in the French debate 關於哈馬斯的這個失誤表述 Regarding his mistaken statement about Hamas 於是他們就放大卡尼的法語弱勢 So they amplified Carney's weakness in French 說你看 連這個辯論的主持人 Saying, “Look, even the debate moderator 都質疑卡尼的法語技能 Questioned Carney's French skills” 經過保守黨這麼一宣傳 With this Conservative propaganda 目的不就是要在魁省老百姓的心目中 Isn't the goal to undermine Carney's appeal 削弱卡尼的吸引力嗎 In the minds of Quebec citizens? 然後再看到卡尼在英語辯論中 Then, seeing Carney in the English debate 又恢復了自信和活力 Regaining his confidence and energy 於是保守黨立刻掉轉矛頭 So the Conservatives immediately shifted their focus 又開始拿 And started using 自由黨在特魯多執政時期的糟糕表現 The Liberal Party's poor performance under Trudeau 來提醒大家 To remind everyone 千萬不要讓自由黨的重置計劃得逞 “Don't let the Liberal Party's reset plan succeed” 等等等等 And so on and so forth 對了 Oh, right 另外還有一個對策 There's another strategy 這個估計大家都沒想到 Which probably no one expected 就是我在節目中 It's the one I mentioned in the show 一開始提到的那個 At the very beginning 留住特魯多的這個熱搜 The “Keep Trudeau” trending topic 大家一看這個熱搜 When people see this hashtag 第一反應就是覺得 Their first reaction is to think 這肯定是自由黨在拉人 “It must be the Liberals drumming up support” 錯了 Wrong 這背後的推手其實並不是自由黨 The real mastermind behind it isn't the Liberal Party 因為真正的自由黨人 Because true Liberals 是絶對不會用這種方法 Would absolutely not use this method 來挽回支持率的 To regain support 在自由黨大魔王 With the Liberal Party's big shot 馬克.卡尼已經橫空出世的背景之下 Mark Carney having already emerged 而且 And 明明知道特魯多的支持率已經爛大街 Knowing full well that Trudeau's approval rating is in the gutter 而且特魯多已經公開正式辭職 And that Trudeau has officially resigned publicly 不可能再回來留任的情況下 With no chance of staying on 你要是再宣傳特魯多 If you still promote Trudeau 這不是有病嗎 Wouldn't that be insane? 我切割還切割不過來 I can't distance myself fast enough 還留住特魯多 And keep Trudeau? 這腦子得進多少水 How much water would have to flood your brain 才能想通過留住特魯多 To think that keeping Trudeau 來輓救自由黨 Could save the Liberal Party? 可以這麼說 Put it this way 誰愛留誰留 Whoever wants to keep him can keep him 反正自由黨是絶對不敢再留 But the Liberals absolutely wouldn't dare keep him 甚至連提他的名字都很尷尬 Even mentioning his name is awkward 這麼一個狀態 That's the situation 好 那問題來了 Alright, here's the question 那不是自由黨干的 If it's not the Liberals doing it 那是誰幹的 Then who is? 還用說嗎 Do I even need to say it? 這背後其實就是保守黨的團隊 Behind it is actually the Conservative team 在後面搞的這個渾水摸魚的戰略 Stirring the pot with this muddy-the-waters strategy 即使不是保守黨親自操刀 Even if the Conservatives didn't directly orchestrate it 他們也會非常樂意的看到 They'd be very happy to see 這件事情的發生 This happen 因為什麼 Why? 因為這件事情 Because this 對保守黨是非常有好處的 Is very beneficial to the Conservatives 一方面可以破壞自由黨的內部團結 On one hand, it can disrupt the Liberals' internal unity 來分散卡尼的支持率 And dilute Carney's support 另外也同時讓老百姓回憶起 While also reminding the public 當年特魯多對加拿大造成的傷害 Of the harm Trudeau caused Canada back then 而且這個時間點也很敏感 And the timing is very sensitive 這個熱搜標籤留住特魯多 This “Keep Trudeau” hashtag 他是在2月22日週六開始出現的 Started trending on Saturday, February 22 其用意就是為了破壞兩天之後 Its purpose was to sabotage the Liberal leadership debate 舉行的自由黨黨魁辯論 Held two days later 那保守黨這招好使嗎 Did this Conservative tactic work? 確實有一定效果 It did have some effect 這個屏幕前的觀眾朋友們 Friends watching this screen 你們可以自己問一下自己 Ask yourselves 當你們看到留住特魯多這個熱搜的 When you saw the “Keep Trudeau” hashtag 第一感覺是什麼 What was your first feeling? 是不是一陣噁心 Wasn't it a wave of nausea? 哈哈 Haha 當年特魯多給我們造成的心靈陰影 The psychological shadow Trudeau left us with back then 再次湧上心頭 Comes rushing back 要的就是這個效果 That's exactly the effect they wanted 不過它這個效果也沒持續多久 But this effect didn't last long 自由黨在週一和週二成功舉行的黨魁辯論 The Liberals' successfully held leadership debates on Monday and Tuesday 有效的轉移了這個熱搜的焦點 Effectively shifted the focus away from this hashtag 而且也遏制住了“留住特魯多” And curbed the “Keep Trudeau” 這處社會閙劇所形成的社會影響 Social farce and its societal impact 好 咱們前面說的 Alright, what we've talked about so far 都是針對自由黨的民調反彈 Is all about the Liberal Party's polling rebound 保守黨如何進行反擊 And how the Conservatives countered it 當然了 這個攻擊是相互的 Of course, the attacks go both ways 那自由黨也不是干挺著挨打不還手 The Liberals aren't just standing there taking it without fighting back 他們面對著保守黨的進攻 Facing the Conservative offensive 也推出了一系列 They've launched a series 反擊性的廣告或者是宣傳文案 Of counterattack ads or promotional copy 也說博勵治的壞話 Also badmouthing Poilievre 其中一個最主要的攻擊點 One of their main attack points 就是說博勵治 Is that Poilievre 他就是一個抱怨者 Is just a complainer 沒有什麼實際的執政經驗 With no real governing experience 學術背景也不強 A weak academic background 工作背景也沒有 And no work experience 畢業之後直接從政 Went straight into politics after graduating 雖說幹過一個部長 Sure, he served as a minister 但是他沒有體會過社會疾苦 But he's never experienced society's hardships 只會提意見 He only knows how to criticize 也沒什麼建設性的解決方案 With no constructive solutions 除了瞎BB Except for empty talk 什麼都不會 He's got nothing 而且這個自由黨 And the Liberals 也經常抓住博勵治以前說過的一些 Often latch onto some snippets Poilievre said in the past 隻言片語 Bits and pieces 給他扣上一些什麼反對工會 Slapping labels on him like anti-union 反對中產階級的帽子 And anti-middle-class 而且還說 And they also say 博勵治的右派思維 Poilievre's right-wing mindset 有可能在減稅的同時消減社會福利 Might cut social welfare while reducing taxes 對加拿大現有的社會福利體系 Dealing a huge blow to Canada's current welfare system 造成一個極大的傷害 Causing massive harm 同時 At the same time 就刻意的把他的民粹主義思想 Deliberately linking his populist ideas 跟特朗普聯繫在一起 To Trump 也是用這種綁定的方式 Also using this binding tactic 只不過 Except 保守黨是想把卡尼跟特魯多綁在一起 The Conservatives want to tie Carney to Trudeau 而自由黨 While the Liberals 是想把這個 Want to tie 這個博勵治跟特朗普綁定在一起 This Poilievre to Trump 你看這個方慧蘭 就直接把博勵治叫做Maple Syrup MAGA They directly call Poilievre “Maple Syrup MAGA” 蜂糖漿MAGA Maple Syrup MAGA 這個這個MAGA大家都知道 Everyone knows this MAGA 是Make American Great Again這個首字母縮寫 Is the acronym for “Make America Great Again” 這句話的意思就是說 This phrase means 博勵治 Poilievre 他是加拿大版的特朗普 Is the Canadian version of Trump 即使博勵治重申過無數遍 Even though Poilievre has reiterated countless times 堅決反對美國吞併加拿大 He staunchly opposes the U.S. annexing Canada 堅決反對特朗普的關稅政策 And firmly opposes Trump's tariff policies 而且 And 自己要帶領加拿大人民反擊特朗普 That he'll lead Canadians to push back against Trump 但是在自由黨口中 But in the Liberals' narrative 你博勵治說什麼都白說 Whatever you say, Poilievre, is pointless 我就給你貼標籤了 I've already labeled you 你咬我啊 What are you gonna do about it? 你就是跟特朗普沆瀣一氣 You're in cahoots with Trump 你就是要出賣加拿大的利益 You're going to sell out Canada's interests 等等等等 And so on and so forth 反正自由黨的手段也不乾淨 Anyway, the Liberals' tactics aren't clean either 而且自由黨在宣傳反擊保守黨 And while the Liberals are counterattacking the Conservatives 抹黑博勵治的同時 And smearing Poilievre 也針對博勵治 They've also targeted Poilievre's 用來攻擊自由黨的一些抓手 Points of attack against the Liberals 還就是他批評的一些政策 Specifically, the policies he's criticized 及時切割 Quickly distancing themselves 及時止損 Cutting their losses 及時進行政策調整 And adjusting policies in time 比方說那個碳稅轉向 For example, shifting on the carbon tax 比方說要承諾減稅 Promising tax cuts 還比方說要加快住房建設 And speeding up housing construction 你看 See 全都是博勵治之前說過的解決方案 These are all solutions Poilievre has mentioned before 自由黨直接拿來就用 The Liberals just took them and used them 連版權費都不用交 Without even paying royalties 這招就比較狠了 This move is pretty ruthless 讓博勵治的拳頭都打在棉花上 Making Poilievre's punches land on cotton 使不出力量來 Unable to exert any force 所以說 So 你看 看到這兒 Look, at this point 估計屏幕前的觀眾朋友們 I bet the viewers in front of the screen 對加拿大的政治的玩法 Have a sense of how Canadian politics works 心裡有了概念了 You've got an idea in your head 但是我這裡不是說孰是孰非 But I'm not here to say who's right or wrong 我只是說 I'm just saying 咱們站在一個中立的立場上 We're looking at this from a neutral standpoint 客觀的看待這場政治遊戲 Objectively observing this political game 不過 However 從目前的形勢來看 From the current situation 自由黨大幅拉近跟保守黨的民意差距 The Liberals have significantly closed the public opinion gap with the Conservatives 這個是事實 That's a fact 但是這個反彈的趨勢 But whether this rebound trend 到底能不能保持下去 Can hold steady 最終形成對保守黨的民意反超 And ultimately overtake the Conservatives in public support 這個我目前並不看好 I'm not optimistic about that right now 自由黨能夠做到這一點 The Liberals pulling this off 至少在我頻道中的觀眾留言 At least based on the comments from my channel's viewers 咱們就可以看出來 We can tell 因為之前特魯多的殺傷力太大了 Because Trudeau's damage before was too great 儘管自由黨的民意有部分的反彈 Even though the Liberals have seen some rebound in support 但是大部分的觀眾 But most viewers 至少大部分這些留言的觀眾 At least most of these commenting viewers 還是堅持要把下一次機會留給保守黨 Still insist on giving the next chance to the Conservatives 不再打算給自由黨機會了 No longer planning to give the Liberals a shot 所以我覺得 So I think 只要保守黨應對得當 As long as the Conservatives handle it well 同時 And at the same time 博勵治本人要需要抓住一切的機會 Poilievre himself needs to seize every opportunity 在媒體上增加曝光率 To boost his media exposure 多多宣傳自己和自己的政策 Promote himself and his policies more 以及自己的團隊 And his team 跟加拿大老百姓說清楚 Make it clear to Canadians 自己不是一個人在作戰 That he's not fighting alone 其實保守黨內也有很多非常優秀的 In fact, the Conservative Party has many highly capable 足以比肩馬克.卡尼和方慧蘭 People who can rival Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland 這對黃金組合的 This golden duo 眾多的優秀人才 Numerous talented individuals 來應對特朗普的關稅威脅 To tackle Trump's tariff threats 以及把握加拿大的未來的前進方向 And steer Canada's future direction 這樣的人才 Such talent 你說保守黨沒有嗎 Are you saying the Conservatives don't have them? 肯定有 Of course they do 一抓一大把 A ton of them 你比方說 For example 那位已經卸任的前總理史蒂芬.哈珀 That former Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who's stepped down 請他重新出山 Bring him back into the fray 那立馬秒殺卡尼 He'd instantly outshine Carney 還有就是這個安省的省長道格.福特 And then there's Ontario Premier Doug Ford 那位也是一位人氣天皇 He's a hugely popular figure 前兩天剛剛贏下了安省的省選 Just won the Ontario provincial election a couple of days ago 而且還是一個多數政府 And with a majority government 這位是能人 This guy's a powerhouse 當然我只是隨便舉了兩個例子 Of course, these are just two random examples 而且我個人認為 And personally, I think 當然我這個腦洞比較大 Sure, this might be a bit of a stretch 保守黨 The Conservatives 如果上台的話 If they take power 那可以拋棄黨派重建 They could set aside partisanship and rebuild 對馬克.卡尼張開懷抱 Open their arms to Mark Carney 就好比當年 Just like back in the day 哈珀政府 The Harper government 可以任命卡尼為央行行長一樣 Appointed Carney as Bank of Canada Governor 那博勵治你為什麼不能承諾 So why can't Poilievre promise 在自己上台之後 That once he's in power 也可以讓卡尼加入自己的內閣 He'll bring Carney into his cabinet too 讓卡尼這位技術專家 Letting Carney, this technical expert 為加拿大人民做出貢獻 Contribute to the Canadian people 當然 現在說什麼都還是太早 Of course, it's still too early to say anything 接下來就得 Next, we'll have to 等到3月9日自由黨黨會選舉結束之後 Wait until after the Liberal Party leadership election on March 9 假如說沒有意外的話 Barring any surprises 應該是馬克.卡尼 It should be Mark Carney 接任特魯多下屆總理的位置 Taking over from Trudeau as the next prime minister 不過在接下來發生什麼 But what happens next 就有很多可能性了 Has a lot of possibilities 按理說在3月底 議會重新開張的時候 Logically, when Parliament reopens at the end of March 這個自由黨很難通過不信任投票 It'll be hard for the Liberals to survive a no-confidence vote 而提前觸發大選 And trigger an early election 但是在面對火燒眉毛的 But with the urgent 特朗普關稅危機面前 Trump tariff crisis looming 很有可能民意反彈 Public opinion might rebound 然後這個見風使舵的NDP And the opportunistic NDP 也很有可能再次反水 Might flip-flop again 讓自由黨挺過這次不信任投票 Helping the Liberals survive this no-confidence vote 從而使得卡尼可以組團參加美加談判 Allowing Carney to assemble a team for U.S.-Canada talks 那麼卡尼就會在這個總理位置上 Then Carney would stay in the prime minister's seat 一直坐到10月底 Until the end of October 然後憑藉著談判的成果 And with the negotiation results 自由黨非常有可能重新聚攏人氣 The Liberals could very well regain popularity 在接下來的10月份大選中 In the upcoming October election 一舉反超保守黨 Overtaking the Conservatives in one fell swoop 贏得下屆大選 Winning the next election 這都是保不齊的事 These are all possibilities 所以 說一千道一萬 So, after all is said and done 總結一句話 In one sentence 這場自由黨和保守黨之間的宮鬥大戲 This palace intrigue between the Liberals and Conservatives 才剛剛開始 Has only just begun 自由黨 Whether the Liberals 能不能把特朗普關稅驅動的民調反彈 Can turn the Trump tariff-driven polling rebound 轉化為持久信任 Into lasting trust 還是說 這只是民調的一個短暫回升 Or if this is just a temporary polling uptick 大家且拭目以待 Let's wait and see 且看最後究竟鹿死誰手 And see who comes out on top in the end 好 咱們就說到這 Alright, that's it for now 如果你喜歡我的視頻 If you liked my video 歡迎打賞點贊訂閲 Feel free to tip, like, and subscribe 或者是點擊屏幕下方的二維碼 Or click the QR code below the screen 用每個月一杯咖啡的錢 With the cost of a coffee each month 贊助莊也進行內容創作 Support Zhuang Ye's content creation 莊也在這裡感謝您的鼓勵和支持 Zhuang Ye thanks you for your encouragement and support 得嘞 咱們下次再見 Alright, see you next time
