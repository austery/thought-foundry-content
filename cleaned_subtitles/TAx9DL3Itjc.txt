ladies and gentlemen it's an honor to introduce two outstanding figures first ncod tangin he is interested with managing almost $2 trillion dollar of nor West wealth with degrees in both art history and psychology nicolai's background is unique he has been a chef Russian translator and even worked in intelligence but his expertise in economics hored at Borton lay the groundwork for his success as a hedge fund manager for the past four years he has been at the helm of Norway Sovereign wealth fund guing guiding it with integrity and skill joining him is Dr Adam poen president of the pet Institute for international economics the Atlantic once suggested Adam belongs in an Allstar $10 billion lineup if there were a Central Banking fantasy league he's one of the most respected voices in international e economics today so we are grateful to Adam and the Peterson Institute for partnering us on this event and I look forward to hearing nikolai's opening remarks please thank you uh Ambassador and ladies and gentlemen to understand um the Norwegian subn wealth fund we need to uh go back in time and um we need to go back in time to 1969 and uh roughly the same time of the year as we are now but not in uh Sunny warm Washington we are out on the Norwegian shelf it's cold and we are on board ocean Viking and this is Phillips Drilling and they have been drilling for quite some time they haven't found a single drop of oil and they're now drilling the last well and if they don't find any oil they have to pack up the toys and go home and then two in the morning um the um this guy called salvon is asked to wake up the platform Chief at Seaborn and at Seaborn is like salvon it's two in the morning you better have a good reason for waking me up and did he have a good reason they had just struck oil they found the echo FIS field and it was a largest field the world had ever seen then this was presented to the Norwegian people the day before Christmas Eve 69 and the question was was this a Christmas gift or not because we had seen in many countries that finding oil and these incredible resources had just been a curse you know it had led to crowded out of Industries led to huge amount of corruption it had just not been very good and so then the Norwegian politicians decided on something really clever let's put it into a fund and this is the first deposit into the fund in 96 two billion Norwegian coroner you know a small deposit and nobody thought the fund was going to be particularly big and the idea of course with the fund was to take the the uh the the the wealth from the shelf and put it into Financial assets and that's what be done so now it's gone from two billion Norwegian Groner to more than 18,000 billion as you can see the dark blue is the money that uh we put into the fund and the light blue is the returns that we have made in financial markets and then we have some currency effects at the top but you see that the returns that we made in the financial markets are now twice as large as the money we put in so in a way we found oil twice once on the continental shelf and then again in financial markets the governance structure of the fund is very important so the money is owned by the Norwegian people of course uh taken care of by the the parliament the parliament have uh given the mandate to the Ministry of Finance so it's the Ministry of Finance which is our client and we have a representative here from the ministry today Espen who is uh you know in a way my boss um and then they have given the Mandate again to norus bank to the central bank and they again have hired us the Norwegian uh norus Bank investment management to run the fund there are um some very important reasons why this why this has worked out really well um I would say one of the things is a very strict and good mandate that we have from the ministry it's quite detailed about how we should invest and I'm coming back to that uh but it is important to have a strict mandate and that has worked really really well it's useful to be situated inside the central bank and I think it will be increasingly important potentially going forward um and then we have uh then is of course it's important that we work with the board the board works with the ministry that we have contact at all levels but of course that we also at the same time understand what the roles are and who is accountable for what so I think this has been um a really really good model another reason why it has worked so well is because of wide political anchoring and here this is from a seminar we had this summer three um ministers they had been Ministers of Finance uh all three of them or treasurers and um they span a very broad political span we here have from uh from kind of uh the Socialist left party to uh the rtist party to The Agrarian party and um they have all agreed on the main uh uh kind of characteristics of the fund they have agreed on the risk profile and every year we have a white paper that goes to the uh to the parliament so that all changes in the Mandate is agreed on by all political parties I think it's totally key so that when you change Parliament or government there is no change in the main ramifications for the fund we invest a across the world and I think a fund of this size needs to be really widely Diversified we have uh now half the money in uh America actually a bit more a third in Europe and then the rest is spread across the rest of the world we started off by a larger proportion in Europe that was kind of closer to home and it was a bit less risky then uh gradually we have moved more assets across uh to the US that's also of course because the US market has developed particularly strongly now lately driven by uh you know all your wonderful technology companies and in terms of the asset split we have now 70% equities and the rest is uh spread mainly fixed income but also uh real estate we own some amazing properties here in DC we have main Holdings in New York Boston uh in London Berlin Paris and so on um and the uh it it started off by being purely in bonds then during the financial crisis the equity ratings went from 40% to 60% and has subsequently moved to uh to 70% and then three four years ago we also got the unlisted renewable infrastructure mandate which in the beginning we were pretty slow to deploy because we thought uh that valuations were very high now we think it's much more attractive like there is less demand for uh renewable infrastructure projects we think returns are better and so now we are have accelerated the the deployment of a money into that asset class so we are one of the largest single shareholders in the world we own one and a half% of all the listed equities and you know I kind of think every time you buy a Starbucks or new sneakers or uh you know new car or whatever I feel pretty happy about it because we get 1 and a half% back um in Europe we own uh just under 3% of uh of all the equities now how do we think as an owner owner well we have um very clear expectations when it comes to companies and I think when you engage with the companies what is important important is that you are predictable I think predictable is the most important thing um we um have clear expectations we have expectation documents on the most important parameters we have expectation documents when it comes to how companies should uh treat corruption how they should think about uh labor how they should think about uh human rights issues and so on and so we have 10 expectation documents which lay out in in great detail how we think they should uh behave we also um engage with companies um and we have more than 3,000 company meetings a year we have portfolio managers who are Specialists on this companies they meet with them on a regular basis and have conversations about all kinds of things from labor rights um to uh disclosure levels um climate plans and so on and then lastly voting what voting is in a way one of the most important ways we can influence companies and so we attend um nearly 10,000 agms every year agms is a bit like this uh meeting where all the shareholders come together and we vote on more than 100,000 100,000 proposals every year now we of course have the votes that we own ourselves one and a half% but what is interesting is that we have so many other shareholders across the world who look at how we vote and now we disclose our voting intentions 5 days ahead of time so we have an additional three percentage points of votes which follow us so close to 5% of against votes in the world would be influenced by uh our decisions so it's a huge responsibility and it means that we uh take well care on how we vote that it is consistent that it's well communicated uh to the companies lastly um transparency very very important we are the most transparent Fund in the world and that's not just a claim because actually there is a world championship in transparency uh now for several years we were lagging uh the Canadians we thought we think it's kind of okay to be beaten by the Canadians in ice hockey but not in transparency so last year we cranked up the efforts uh we won for the first time and then last week uh we won again and it's it's really really important because what we see is that transparency and knowledge creates trust and so we are transparency with the Norwegian people we are the only fund which closes all of our Holdings twice a year and pretty much everything we do is out there so to conclude in my mind this is sex Factor for the fund has been you know a clear and good mandate from the ministry it's been broad political anchoring it's been a spending rule which decides how much we can take out of the fund every year and that's Limited at uh 3% and then lastly it is the transparency thank you and then Adam we going to have a chat here thank you [Applause] well I think you're supposed to sit over here okay sorry I just couldn't make it in one stride I'm not as you okay thank you Nikolai um thank you all for coming out when the embassy approached uh the Peterson Institute to host Nikolai we were all like oh my God yeah sure great um and then then the embassy was like and we'll pay for the food I was like oh yeah sure great um but then they said it's going to be on Monday November 11th and I was like you're bloody kidding me right um but obviously the fund their CEO uh the prospects for long-term thinking uh this is all very attractive to people and so that's why we have such a distinguished crowd and such a full crowd tonight so thank you all for coming out I'm going to ask ncai a few questions and uh have a bit of a discussion and then we'll open it up to the audience uh I see a lot of familiar faces and I fail to recognize some others that I should probably recognize and we'll try to pretend otherwise Nikolai why don't we dive right into it um you and I were talking briefly before your remarks and you were saying how this is a really interesting time to be an investor um there's geopolitics there's technological change there's climate change how does is come together for you I mean if in a sense you could just index and just buy a little bit of everything but that's not what you do so how do you how does this Confluence of forces affect your thinking yeah I think um um climate geopolitics technology and finance are intertwined in a way that we have never seen before and it started to happen probably four five years ago where for the first time we saw if we just take the various links here um first of all the link between uh climate and finance is becoming increasingly clear and it's mainly because of harvests which are getting worse and worse and so you are seeing increasing prices for everything from you know cocoa beans uh chocolate olive oil orange juice all these kind of things is really underpinning inflation which of course is one of the biggest threats to you know stock markets so that's a new that's a new one and I think the link is just becoming stronger and stronger then we see technology and finance we see it of course because what is driving the markets these days is mainly the technology companies and they are just getting bigger and bigger and so we are seeing a concentration in the stock market which is bigger than we've ever seen before and it's driven by many things I mean one is that in society generally we have a Winner Takes It All situation you know that are more people now listening to Taylor Swift than everybody listening to Jazz and classical music combined right so you see it in sport and you see it in finance you see it in technology companies more than in other companies because just the fact that you are big makes you even bigger the reason why you order an Uber is because there are so many of them they come straight away the reason why you on Facebook is because there's so many people on and then in AI you kind of turbocharge that again because these models are so expensive to develop that you need to be very big to really make something out of it so that's kind of the technology impact on the stock market now then you have technology impacting geopolitics you know the relationship between China and the US very much uh impacted by technology export controls uh these kind of things and um impacting now um research in so many new areas two of the Nobel prizes over the last few weeks have been driven by AI both uh physics and chemistry so uh it's really just changing the Landscapes and then of course you have the the geopolitical situation which is new so all this is coming together in in a totally new way right which means that when I wake up in the morning I'm just like spinning out of bed because you don't want to spend time in bed when you can read the papers and look into what's going on because it's just so exciting I don't know about you but I'm I'm I'm I'm thinking about that look like SK yeah no exactly well it's partly I don't have $2 trillion dollar to manage but it's also there's that emoji you know with the clinch teeth um but let let let's try to transl that excitement so if the trends are clear in a sense that the incumbents the large players the the already technologically advanced the already networked are going to get bigger and bigger why are you reading the papers I mean is there any possibility of deconcentration um is there disruption the US can do to China or vice versa that would change the game um I mean there there seems to be a bit of a tension between the way you describe the trends and your excitement to get up and do something now what is what is of course um in a way uh interesting here as well is that the largest companies are linked into the same geopolitical risks right um now you look at the for instance the biggest gainers we had in the portfolio in the first half of this year so you have asml in Holland they make the machines to produce microchips they sell them to uh to you know one Taiwanese company uh the chips are uh the most advanced chips are designed by Nvidia of course and I sell them to the super uh you know scalers So Meta um you know Amazon and so on and so um it's very concentrated in terms of the risks we are seeing you know it's um geographically quite concentrated and if something happened it impact most of the uh Supply chains for most of the kind of things that we consume so it's um at a time where we have in a way more concentration than ever before it's linked to one geopolitical situation in a way that we also haven't seen before so that's that's uh exciting how can a fund like yours in a sense hedge or take advantage of these geopolitical risks I mean or is it like the weather you know where climate is and you just have to reset your expectations no you want to there um the important things here is one that you have uh that you are broadly Diversified across the world across asset classes uh very important the second thing is you need to have a long-term time Horizons so that if you do have um volatility in the market you can take advantage of it so I think the uh I think those are the the most important things um Norway another part of the Norwegian government as it were um as the Ambassador represents here um has been pursuing a pretty strong foreign and security policy woring about Russia leadership in NATO alliance with the US it's part of that um what what happens down the road what happens if there are great opportunities in China or Russia and the foreign policy of Norway is let's say concerned about the behavior of Russia or China how do you how do you is there a statute on how you have to deal with that or is this a judgment thing how do you think about that yeah so um one another important thing is that um the fund is not a political tool very very important we have one goal and that is to make money right in a responsible way and with a set level of risk but it's very very important that we are not used as a political tool as long when you start to get like several goals you are not really accountable anymore and you can always blame uh lack of results on something else so I think that's uh I think that's really key now when it comes to to Russia um in a way that was the first time that um that the parliament uh made a political decision about the fund we were told that we were to sell out of Russia but I think that was quite an extreme situation we don't expect uh that to be repeated anytime soon just more broadly maybe it's the parliament in your case but there's also consumer investor demands for more concern about green issues about investment in so-called dirty Industries one of the issues one of the many issues where uh the incoming Trump Administration is likely to differ from the past administration is trying to diminish some of the environmental regulations and standards in the US um how does how do pressures over green affect you does that count as political so you it's only if the parliament overrides or do you mention the importance of the climate transition I mean how do you think about this when there's demands for response yeah I would say that we um um we follow the instructions from the parliament um the Norwegian Parliament is uh unified in believing that climate is important and that we should uh in constructive dialogue with the companies um try to be supportive for their um for their work uh towards an n z world and so that's what we are doing so we um have not changed our mind or our way of working we continue to be uh persistent and um and predictable it was very striking in your opening remarks at least to me um your slide talking about active but not activist and you're saying that you want to be predictable and you just said it again where I mean since you are the most transparent fund congratulations where are some examples of where that kind of interaction with companies you have stake in have made a difference I mean where have you been active but not activist that you think you've had a good influence I me good however you define it but where you've had an impact yeah um oops well we do see um we do see that where we engage and where we talk to companies about uh the importance of having a um you know a carbon production plan we see that more companies have plans um and so that's a development that of course we are we are not the so reason for that but we we can see a relationship between engagement and results we see it again we have been advocating the fact that the chair and the CEO should not be the same person we think it's good governance and we are used to that from Europe that it should be to different people uh in the US over the last 10 years it's gone from 45% of companies who have I mean which have kind of the combined uh function in one to 35 so 45 to 35 over 10 year period so that's have had some impact where we have had no progress whatsoever is on uh pay packages mhm um now what we do we are not uh we are not uh against High salaries but they need to be uh they need to be in line with our interest they should be long-term they should be tied to results they should be Equity based and so on and so we got pretty clear uh expectations for how that should be structured but um but you know pay packages are continuing to move up yeah um another one of the slides you put up you you had a pie chart about the uh asset allocation across four classes uh equities fixed income real estate and unlisted energy I think it was um we have seen in recent years another Financial trend is more and more companies going private at least in the US but I think elsewhere as well um fewer and fewer companies listing publicly how does this affect the funds thinking is this something that you're going to react to by taking more private investment placements is this something you view as an opportunity because you have thinner public markets and you can get more of what you want I'm not trying to feed words in your mouth I'm trying to ask you know so just as one of the world's leading investors how do you think about this trend yeah well you're right there are fewer companies being listed on a socket ex change and amongst the ones listed it's more concentrated yeah so fewer companies account for more and more of the index and so there is a much higher risk in the stock market from that point of view than what's been the case before I would probably argue that there is more risk in the listed market now than in the unlisted we are not uh it's not in our mandate to be in uh private Equity it's something that the fund has suggested several times and there is now a political process where um they will investigate further whether we should be allowed to do that there's been questions about fee structures the general opinion in Norway is that the fees are very high and that transparency has been low and that esfg considerations have been low now I think for sure transparency has been improving and ESG considerations have been improving and corporate governance have been improving so we'll see what um we'll see what they come up with I mean it's a it's a good process um I actually think personally it's probably a good time to scale into uh you know private private Market because um they they are they are having a tough time I think you can get pretty good uh fee deals and um and you can also get get positions in the in the secondary market so it feels a bit like increasing the uh equity share during the financial crisis that's the way it feels to me potentially with private Equity right but we'll see nothing is decided very good um I'm going to come to the audience for questions in the next few minutes and um I believe we're trying to record this so I don't know if there's a traveling mic or yes it looks like there's a tall person with a traveling mic so that's good um but just a couple more questions before that if I could please um we have with us tonight Ted Truman who was one of the leaders in the effort to get Sovereign wealth funds to have standards of transparency um obviously there are some very large funds that do not not get a successful rating and transparency as you or the Canadians um not asking you to name names um but in general I mean is is the transparency something that makes you more accountable is the transparency something that makes you more palatable in when you're investing abroad is the transparency something that humor the parliament I mean you you don't you don't have a lot of investors right you have one investor so I is transparency an unalloyed good for a fund yeah I mean on the one hand we got one investor on the other on the other hand we kind of got five million investors right because um it's owned by the citizens uh I think it's key to trust I think it's key to trust um I just love transparency you know I think it means that you you stick to what you're supposed to do you are accountable you get everybody to run in the same direction everybody knows knows what we are about um so I I I see no the only the only reason why why transparency could be negative would be if people started to trade against your positions and that's why we think disclosing them every every six months is is right but more frequent than that would not be would not be very sensible very clear so my final question before I open it to the audience is about the purposes and the capacities to make a sovereign wealth fund work for our country I mean you spoke about you have the beautiful repeat image of was it 1969 discovering oil in the last well at 2 am. um but so then there's a very compelling story right that the oil is going to run out sometime our country needs to accumulate people have started talking about the US should have a Sovereign wealth fund um which strikes me as kind of odd because we don't have the surpluses you do um but maybe I'm missing something so without commenting directly on that I mean when is a sovereign wealth fund a good idea for a country could it be a country that you know like Denmark doesn't have oil but has uh anti-obesity drugs and they should run a sovereign wealth fund off that I mean what what what what countries should be following your example yeah I mean in way they have a so wealth Fund in Denmark as well but it's called the Nova Nordisk Foundation right which funds uh research and a lot of incredible things um and in a way they kind of have them in Sweden too through the woolenberg sphere and some of their uh foundations but um well where it works the best is if you have some kind of windfall profit uh that you want to save uh and Save card for future Generations right so that's kind of the starting point and then I would say what's worked for for us in Norway is um uh broad anchoring of the Mandate a spending rule which by the way was made by by Yen stoltenberg um ex um Secretary General of NATO when he was the Minister of Finance and prime minister um and then and then the um and then the transparency I would say yeah sorry one final question then um a number of us uh economists at least and some Finance people have commented on the idea that the equilibrium interest rate the let's say the 10 average 10year interest rate on safe government debt is rising partly because of fiscal excess partly because of productivity growth but variety views it's rising if we're going to be in a persistent High rate or high higher rate environment how does that affect your thinking about your allocations your investment how does that affect the draw rule I mean should Parliament be revisiting the 3% three and a half% based on what the interest rate is or is that something should just remain fixed well sometimes um having uh an unchanged rule in itself has a very strong value right so instead of kind of fine-tuning it changing it often to have something kind of set in stone it's a really good thing so I'll be surprised if that rule was Revisited anytime soon okay not going to get a conceptual answer but a very clear answer um let me open it up uh who would like to ask a question okay seems like the left side of the panel if you could get the gentleman there third row please say your name and identify yourself when asking a question my name it's an X World Bank one question related to what your answer was but context is how is the different what is the difference between your governance and objective from some of the Middle Eastern fronts like the Saudi fund or the UAE qat or the other side which is very much in the news here University end government funds which are also public just to make it more specific to the current debate you talked about ESG the financial sector has latched on to ESG indicators but almost all the academic research including two NBR papers this week show that ESG is used more as an enrichment of the CEO rather than having any real impact so what is your view on that maybe we'll collect two questions at a time so if you can hand out there was there was kind of two there already so yeah yeah yeah but let me let me I don't think I can remember all this I'll remember for you the person in front of you if you could go to the gentleman in front of him that's actually a good piggy back on my question Dorth from the mil Institute my question specifically was I think most us asset managers and allocators share your strong convictions on climate over the long term but they bought up against fiduciary duty here in the United States you can't generate or demonstr unless you can demonstrate quantifiable Alpha you can't say climate investing generates Alpha so if you could speak to maybe the US managers allocators who might want to allocate more towards climate but but up against rfcc but up against fiduciary duty what are some of the tangible specifics in terminal value or multiple expansion whatever it is uh when you make your assessment probably more towards the med okay so um comparison with other soan wealth fund it's fair to say that uh some of the funds we don't know so much about it right because they are quite secretive and not very transparent and uh you know even a fantastic fund like GIC in Singapore they they report their Returns on a rolling 20-year basis and they don't disclose assets right so so it's difficult to know sometimes but um no many of them are really really great firms um it's uncertain to me sometimes whether they are part of the foreign policy of the country or whether they are uh have a goal of just uh trying to generate the highest possible Financial returns uh we don't know some of them are spending money domestically we don't do that we only spend money outside of Norway um the whole point was to to kind of keep the capital outside not to distort uh the domestic economy and uh and the currency how we compare with us endowments well you have some amazing endowments in this country right um and I have in my previous life been managing capital for many of them I would say the main difference they probably um they are more into alternative assets uh they are using more external managers they are they are uh you know quite comfortable by paying uh quite High fees because they really look at net returns and in our part of the world we have a problem paying big fees right it's just something we really don't like and then uh ESG yeah well for sure I would say that ESG has nothing to do with enriching CEOs I I I really don't see that link um and also kind of um combining that the thing is that if you if you own 20 companies you don't really necessarily have to care so much but if you own the whole world like we do you know one and a half% of the whole world if you have one company polluting ha you pick it up in all your other Holdings you have to care and if you hear if you have like a 5200 year investment Horizon you definitely have to care uh and as we talked about earlier you know the link between climate and inflation is is clearly there uh we see it now in we do see it in reinsurance rates they're going up we do see it in productivity in some parts of the world you cannot work in the middle of the day because it's too Hal right so you are you are seeing it in many in many different ways and I uh you know we argue that uh that it is a Financial Risk thank you um hey great all these question yeah I know it's fine by me um can we get the two l in the second row please friend the atletic Council of Mardy Associates I was struck by the difference of your level of investments in the United States versus Europe um and I wondered if you could explain a bit what you find lacking in Europe in terms of investment and uh what you would suggest that Europe do as you know discussion about this with Botha and dring reports saying how important additional investment would be in Europe my name is constan SCH I run the central on the US inter bookings institution um you presented uh the work of your fund as very transparent admirably so um fundamentally apolitical but we live in a time uh when very wealthy billionaires Tech billionaires are taking overtly political positions and positions that are anti-democratic and in fact are exhibiting a distinct fness for autocratic political models how do you feel about that and what do you think is the responsibility the civic responsibility of people in your position in that context thank you um Europe um so I'm a proud European okay um but um we see we see that productivity growth in Europe has been not very strong and for sure uh less than what we see in America and it is um it's really worth reading the drau report because it lays out in great detail why that is the case and it has to do with um the industry mix we have little technology which has been driving growth we have quite a lot of kind of old Industries uh uh and that's where a lot of the research money is still going in you know into the car industry for instance um there is something with mentality in Europe um we take less risks you know if you go bankrupt in Europe you are you normally don't get a second chance here it's part of your learning right um so there is a higher willingness for making mistakes and for taking risks and it's something really positive about that and then it's just the mentality right I mean hey I went to business school here you know 5% is that a high or a low number in Europe they think it's a high number in America it's a really low number right it's just something with how you are how you anchor your Ambitions so there are a lot of things there I think for the moment now it's what we seeing is uh and it's also of course regulation and we have we meet with cosos uh across the various countries um there is a lot of Regulation um and that's really holding back uh you know R&D establishments Innovation uh and so on what would it take to to get it to move uh well drai claims that it takes uh quite a bit of money and it takes takes leadership right then is it our responsibility to think about um extremely wealthy people who um like auts yeah who like a I don't think that's our task to sort out I think that's somebody else who needs to look at that okay that was clear um all right we got two this is nice when people sit together for questions so we got two another pair here T form appear Institute uh thank you uh when I first started studying s wealth funds one of my colleagues said that uh Sovereign wealth Fund in Norway has been a political issue at all times every election is about the Sovereign wealth fund now you emphasize that the consensus among politicians in in Norway at least at the Pres so has that changed or is the question of what you're doing with the money or how much is spent now rather later which I think Jo's question um uh uh is that still an issue in uh in in Norway and you have a problem I guess in some sense so much of the budget is paid out of the out of the Sovereign weal fund is that a is that a problem in terms of the domestic politics Joe Peterson insute uh actually T that wasn't a my question but I I like your question I I'm looking forward to the answer my question is about the is Success raising it its own problems in the sense that uh the purpose of the fund is to save resources for the future Generations as you pump the oil out but almost no countries in the world have ever done that uh most all exporters never said anything inre you know in in recent decades there's been some efforts and a few have have exceeded and are up there with Norway inul and maybe Singapore so wellls but most it would be hard to say not so does this growing inequality sort of sort of Gap between those who a few who have succeeded Beyond anyone's dreams and I think it's quite fair to say that over the years the fund has grown much bigger than projected every 10 years it's bigger than projected uh does that success raise tensions or issues either inside Norway or outside in terms of the inequality uh that it presents there is a very um there there is a very uh clear um split uh in terms of the roles we have in no way right so we spend no time on how the money is going to be spent that's the politicians the only thing we care about is to make money and then it goes into the budget next year is projected at 2 and a half% of the fund and it will cover something like 23% of the budget uh but how it's going to be dispersed and spent that's we have nothing to do with it and we would never talk about that because we will not uh be seen to try to interfer political matters um does it create increased inequality within the country no I mean U the fund uh decrease inequality within the country because it's being used on education uh you know health care and uh and so on does it increase uh you know the wealth of Norway relative to other countries um yes I guess it it does but it's interesting what you say that countries generally have not kept large uh wealth for a long time you're right there has never been there has never been a successful fund for a very long time never in the history of the world now how um how could this fund disappear well it could disappear if uh if you had a massive draw down in financial markets caused by something which is really bad and so therefore you would not adjust down the spending of the fund so you um and at the same time you sack management and close investment positions at the wrong time then the fund doesn't last for long that's the main risk thank you I've been leaning to my left without symbolism is there some one or two people who' like to ask a question on this side of the room yeah and back please cther Lynch with black rock fixed income you a more about how you see that 10 basis point allocation to unlisted infrastructure evolving over time yeah I think it will um I think it will go up um well we when we got it into our mandate um in 21 I well we we thought that the returns in that part of the market was they were not very attractive it's got of really difficult to remember back to the days but you know Green investment that it was so hot you couldn't get in uh or all the boards told all the investment managers you have to increase your green Investments because otherwise we look stupid and we won't get any clients massive massive pressure to make investments at very low returns huge competition he was just really not attractive so we made one investment and then we just paused and didn't do much for a long period of time now I think it's very different right um much less Focus I mean clearly in the states uh the The View started to change first it's coming to Europe to a certain extent uh there is less competition for uh for renewable infrastructure projects and they are more attractive they we they are you know we we have done a few lately and we think we'll do more anyone else from this side like to raise their hand okay back over here I got five okay so uh the two in the back row the lady and the gentleman there I don't care which order for mono Associates to see you question about fixed income we talked about the equity side of the portfolio but curious about the role of fixed income in your portfolio uh in a world where correlations have gotten tighter is it liability management is it duration positioning how do you think about the role of fixed income in this in the fund and before he answers it if you could go to the lady over there please thank you thank you I have a followup question on the gentl and your answer I would like to know uh your views of sovereign we funds investing domestically we see other than some countries at the Middle East and the developing countries now governments wanting to establish such funds what do you think benefits RIS thank you well I I think I'm me whether uh wealth funds should spend money domestically or abroad I think that totally depends on the function of the fund and why it was established right you could make a good argument for both but for us it was to keep uh to keep the money outside the country so very clear uh very clear part of the structure fixed income is there to balance returns um and we also have a very good rebalancing rule so that when um when equities go up a lot and come uh and go uh you know above where they should be we rebalance and and vice versa so uh when stocks are high we sell them and put more into bonds and the other way around so it's a rebalancing rule which again has been made by the Minister of Finance and which works really well um okay so that dealt with the second question okay and the first question yeah all right so the grayhair gentleman there and the grayhair gentleman there there so I don't discriminate I'm the hairless gentleman here so it's okay Wilson Center when you were talking about risk uh we're running enormous deficits here in the country where you have a half your Investments and they don't look like they're going down anytime soon at at some point is there a risk of a bond holder rolt or anything like that that would affect overall your invests here in the US and that gentlemen yeah thank you um I have two closely related inter you get one Mark no you get one question not two all right I'll phrase it down to one then you'll get cut off if you cheat so you have $2 trillion for a country of five million people it's a self- sustaining Fund in perpetuity um and um you transfer 3% of GDP as you said to the budget every year but why do you need a fund that um exists into eternity and why not provide for example tax cuts or something like that more money to benefit citizens in nor way currently thank you that was a good one question well uh tax taxes that I mean that's a political decision that politicians have to answer for um yeah I haven't got a view on on taxes um is there a a debt scenario public debt scenario in the US that would cause you to rethink your overweight allocation you know I think it's a it's a it's a very very good question of course and the budget deficit situation is uh is in a way front of front of mind uh it's a very and I'm asking a lot of of the the biggest brains in this country to try to figure out what they think and where is the where is the pain point and where do you start to get start to get worried and at which level will investors certainly start to demand a much higher rate to uh to buy government debt I I don't think I have a good answer but it's certainly something uh we watch of course the we hear the same from IMF right they have been very clear and loud about it and and the World Bank and so on so um there are many very clever people who are worried about it okay uh back there again I'm looking over here looking over here no okay back then Washington University um the environmental shock is clearly a global systemic shock at the same time with besides getic risks we know recent the have put out most countries have very high government debts as well as priv so going forward are you expecting lower returns given the situation yeah I do expect lower returns going forward um because um we've had a very long period of falling interest rates from high levels down to zero and now they back up a bit but you know um not huge we do see underlying inflationary uh forces we mentioned in the food market for instance um valuations in a stock markets are higher so I think we should expect uh returns to be lower going forward I think it's going to be difficult to make a lot of money so I think the ements um need to be very careful with their exp they need to be uh focused in on exportation management that's no fun um it's probably right but it's no fun um one last question unless you're I think we have four minutes left till the witching hour going once yes that gentlemen thank you uh Ashraf H from Ravenswood Partners uh one of the big uh Trends in the US has been the passive versus active uh Trend and you used to run an active fund now you're you know 2% owner of all world's asset where is your view of where this all shakes out uh at least in US markets well I think it's very interesting the passive versus uh active debate um we we what we do is that we run the capital uh close to the index and so we have index weights from the ministry and then we have a risk budget which tells us how far from the index week can be um there's clearly um more and more money going into passive and um but the problem is somebody somebody needs to be active because you need to establish prices in the market and somebody needs to be responsible and vote uh and so on so I suspect that the development will continue in the direction of passive uh and we will continue to do a combination of both great one of the great things about I believe you already had a question one of the great things about doing an event with a Norwegian a financial Visionary someone who has a reporting relationship inside a central bank all these aspects along with nikolai's obvious personal talents mean you do get Frank answers clear answers brief answers it's a real learning experience for me and I believe everyone in the audience uh thank you for including this form of transparency in your Wast visit and thanks to the Ambassador and the Norwegian Embassy the Royal Norwegian Embassy we at the Peterson Institute in the spirit of transparency do have some support from n's Bank investment management and are proud and have learned a lot from the relationship and we hope we'll continue to enable learning in both directions thank you all very much thank you [Music]
