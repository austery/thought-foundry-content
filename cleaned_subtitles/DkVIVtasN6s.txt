Why do ghosts come back to the world?
Why cling to someone?
How can the ghost rest in peace?
Today I am super crooked and I am going to talk about "Spell Return"
"Blade of Ghost Slayer"
In "Bad Obsession Eliminator"
In the theatrical version of "Spell Back"
Actor Yi Gu and his childhood sweetheart Lixiang agreed to grow up and get married
Rika died in a car accident
After death, he turns into a curse spirit and attaches himself to Yi Gu
Therefore, Yi Gu embarked on a journey to become a magician
Hope to find a way to get rid of Satoka's curse
In "Ghost Slayer"
The family of the protagonist Tanjiro was murdered without mercy
Sister Nezuko accidentally survived but turned into a ghost
Tanjiro joins the Demon Slayer Squad
Finding a way to turn my sister back into a human
In the Taiwanese drama "Bad Obsession Eliminator"
Pu Yiyong, the hero of a family of calligraphy
also survived a car accident
father sadly passed away
grandpa unconscious
The protagonist wakes up and finds that he has the same super power as his grandfather
Can communicate with the obsession of the ghost of the dead
In the process of helping to eliminate obsessions
But I found that I was also trapped in the obsession with my father's death
In these three works
We've all seen protagonists haunted by secrets from their past
And the time when the ghost appeared
Just in time for the truth of the traumatic event to be hidden
it's here
We see what psychoanalysts Abraham and Torok call "cryptonymy"
Many families avoid the truth about family trauma to future generations
Will suppress a key word in my heart
It's like keeping a secret in a back room
The secret turns out to be a ghost instead
pestering people who don't know the truth
They will look for the truth in the unconscious
Even repeating the mistakes of the previous generation
In "Parasite High"
The protagonist discovers the secret hidden in the secret room of the Park family by the former housekeeper:
Secret a husband eliminated by society
Became a "ghost" haunting the Pu family for many years
Trying to send a message to the Park children through "Grammar of the Secret Room"
<font color=#FFF000FF>Duo Song is a boy scout, he should understand this</font>
It turned out to bring him childhood psychological trauma
But the Pu family don't face this ghost, don't take it seriously
<font color=#FFF000FF>Duo Song's father said that children grow up like this</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>It is also said that there are ghosts in the house that can help the business bring wealth</font>
The result of refusing to face the ghost
Is to pass this ghost to the next family
causing the house to continue to be haunted
In "Full Start"
Actor Cobb locks his dead wife Mal in a dream room
Mal kept repeating the "secret room grammar" agreed with Cobb before his death
But Cobb suppresses the truth of this backroom grammar:
He planted this unconscious idea on his wife in the back room
As a result this repression creates the ubiquitous ghost
The wife comes back to pester the protagonist
disrupt his every mission
And in "Bad Obsession Eliminator"
Pu Yiyong saw the secrets in his grandfather's secret room when he was a child:
To relieve the knots of ghosts formed by the obsession of the dead
But don't know the truth about this family secret
Father's death and grandpa's coma after car accident
Keeping family secrets from being revealed
cannot pass on
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Only he knows</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>It is useless to keep guessing and pursuing this matter</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Because there will be no answer</font>
but no family history
Instead, Pu Yiyong unconsciously walked on the road that his grandfather had walked repeatedly.
<font color=#FFF900FF>I'm just waiting to see how different you are from your grandpa</font>
Ghosts with obsession started looking for him
And he started to look like grandpa
hide the ghost in the secret room
The same Tanjiro also died after his family died.
The inheritance of family knowledge is broken
He couldn't learn his father's secret
<font color=#FFFC00FF>Only this Kagura dance and earrings must be passed on without interruption</font>
Tanjiro mistakenly thought he was using the same breath of flame as Yan Zhu
Didn't know it was actually her father's breath of the sun
in these examples
We've all seen our ancestors' secret memories repressed
Become a transgenerational phantom
come back to disrupt the lives of future generations
But the protagonist does not know that he has repeated the trajectory of the previous generation
Until the moment the family truth is revealed
the ghost will disappear
This doesn't just happen on an individual, family level
It also happens at the level of groups and cultures
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Schools and hospitals will be recalled many times</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>Every time you are recalled, you will receive negative emotions</font>
<font color=#FFEC00FF>The more negative emotions accumulate, the curse will be produced like this</font>
Maki makes an important point here:
Why do Japanese ghosts always appear on campuses and hospitals?
Because it is the place with the most negative emotions in Japanese memories
Psychologist Samuel Kimbles found that
Not only culture will be passed on
The ghosts of culture also see through visual images
The unconscious passed on to the next generation
Because of group trauma and suffering
Always linked to a specific image to be remembered
The ancient Greek word for phantom is phantasma
in different cultures
The phantoms that ghosts connect to are also different
Japanese ghost stories often happen on campus
Young people killed in large numbers reflecting school bullying culture
Come back as a ghost
Demanding that society collectively confront this cultural specter
by contrast
America's ghost stories don't happen on campus
And it always happens in the shady mansion, the backyard
because these places
It is the place used to enslave black people in the history of the United States
Lynching in the backyard was a popular pastime in the United States in the 19th century
These groups that are not recognized by society and are not seen
haunt the living like ghosts
asking society to see their humanity
In South Korea, there are 900,000 civilians living in semi-basements (반지하)
Commoners who can't afford a house
Can only wander the bottom floor like a ghost
<font color=#FFEA00FF>I am not the only one living underground</font>
<font color=#FFEA00FF>If you count the semi-basement, there will be more people</font>
A class society with unequal wealth is a haunted house
Ghost stories are found in various cultures and histories
The powerless cries of the oppressed and marginalized
And ghost stories will be told
It is because these cultural ghosts still haunt people in society
Ghosts become carriers of cultural history
Like the ending of "Parasite and High"
As long as the previous generation didn't find out the truth about the haunting
Seeing the oppressed, the silenced presence
The next generation must bear the debt of the previous generation
buy this haunted house
This is exactly why after dealing with the ghost's obsession
Pu Yiyong asked the police to let the family members know the truth
<font color=#FFF200FF>Let his parents watch</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>At least don't let them guess or imagine</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>They have a right to know</font>
In "Spell Back"
The curse spirit leaked out more directly about the relationship between ghosts and negative emotions
<font color=#FFF000FF>Human beings are made of lies</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>Superficially positive emotions and behaviors must have a negative side</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>However, negative emotions such as hatred and killing intent are all genuine emotions</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>And those of us who are born of negative emotions are cursed</font>
<font color=#FFF000FF>is the purest and most real human being</font>
Mantras originate from negative emotions repressed by humans
These unexpressed emotions are more "human"
So the leader of the curse spirit is also named "True Man"
But the social order maintained by conjurers
It's to remove the curse spirit to protect the public
repress negative emotions
maintaining the illusion of social harmony
<font color=#FFDF00FF>Do you have doubts about today's world? </font>
<font color=#FFDF00FF>I refer to this society where conjurers secretly maintain social order</font>
<font color=#FFDF00FF>It is very contradictory for the strong in this world to adapt to the weak</font>
How to deal with the curse of negative emotions
Xia Youjie who admires curse
Desire to create a world where only the strong
Conjurers should use curses to eliminate weak humans
The opposite Gojo Satoru wants to create a world without curses
Conjurers should use curses to protect humans
fight curse with curse
it's here
Gojo Wu's "Real Dream" and Xia Youjie's "Negative Dream" Debate
Freud's theory of the origin of civilization
Freud thought
The destructive negative power of the strong if too strong
could lead to the disintegration of civilized society
Xia Youjie tried to kill all non-conjurers
Expand the Hyakki Night Walk Project
It is the manifestation of the superpower destroying a civilized society due to excess power
So civilization invented law, morality, family ethics
to control human aggression
but paradoxically
When human instinctive impulses and negative emotions are suppressed
humans get sick
Lose the power to hit the system
loss of cultural creativity
Just like the relationship between knotweed and double-faced Nuo
The container keeps blocking its own inner voice
The result is that civilization is cursed
Humans can no longer evolve
<font color=#FFF900FF>The primate of all things is still self-styled and does not seek evolution</font>
How to resolve the conflict between Xia Youjie and Wujo Wu?
Freud's answer was
Don't suppress your negative emotions
but don't let go completely
but through acquired training
Sublimate your own aggressiveness and destructiveness into a force that is helpful to society
In "Spell Back"
This is the key to becoming a conjurer
Conjurers must learn to sublimate their negative emotions
Know how to release it and transform it into your own power
<font color=#FFE400FF>The curse is born from the negative emotions of people</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>Since this is the case</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>Then put hatred, fear, regret</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>All are released and gathered in the fist</font>
same
Nezuko also learned to control her aggression through acquired
turn it into a power to help brother
Tanjiro, in order to turn his sister back into a human
Collect blood during ghost killing
Assist Zhu Shi in medical research
Sublimate people's destructive and negative emotions into a power to help the collective
This is the origin of civilization
Many achievements of human civilization are derived from the sublimation of negative emotions
"Li Sao" is Qu Yuan's cry
"The Sorrows of Young Werther" is Goethe's pain of not getting his lover
'Modern Times' is Chaplin's dissatisfaction with capitalism
And in "Ghost Slayer Blade"
The key to dealing with negative emotions goes beyond sublimation
still have memory
Because people become ghosts
You will forget your regrets and regrets in your lifetime
Tanjiro puts his hand on the Oni's head
This is actually the method of recalling memory that Freud used in his early days
"pressure technique"
Tanjiro is like a psychoanalyst
Help ghosts regain their memories
Allow repressed emotions to be expressed again
<font color=#FBFF00FF>It’s so warm, I remember everything</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>I want to apologize</font>
<font color=#FBFF00FF>Sorry it's all my fault</font>
The ghost disappears after the memory is restored
turned back to human
as in a psychoanalytic consultation room
When the patient's unconscious truth is revealed
symptoms disappeared
etc.
But what do ghosts of the dead come back for the living?
<font color=#FFF100FF>Send me this power</font>
<font color=#FFF100FF>I don't want to go back to my original body</font>
<font color=#FFF100FF>I want to get out of there</font>
Anthropologist Robert Hertz discovered
in cultures around the world
People hold two funerals for the dead
The first biological funeral
disposing of the dead body
The second is a social funeral
Turn the dead into ancestors through ritual naming
The deceased is no longer biologically dead
but out of the body into another world
Join the ranks of ancestors past
That's why people make funerary objects
In order to let the dead stay in another world
prevent them from returning to earth
The difference between man and animals is that man must die twice
Inventing funerals to differentiate biological death from social death
But if a man makes a mistake between these two deaths
What if I can't finish the funeral?
After the Trinity Tsunami in Japan
A large number of ghost collisions occurred in Ishinomaki City, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan
Ghost of deceased returns to family's home
take a taxi
as if you don't know you're dead
Because these dead are exactly in between two kinds of death
experienced biological death
But did not experience the funeral of the symbolic ceremony
Because the body of the deceased has not been found
Not yet identified as dead in the symbolic world of the human world
In "Bad Obsession Eliminator"
The tattoo on the back of an unknown corpse turns into a ghost and returns
Ask Pu Yiyong to find the name of the deceased within the time limit
Justify the name of the dead
Why names are so important to the dead
Psychoanalyst Lacan
Because the ghost returns to the world to recover the "symbolic debt"
dead man made a mistake on second death
And back asks to be symbolized
Because only the body of the deceased was found, but the name and cause of death were not known
would not be able to house the dead in the human cultural world
Like those bums outcast by society
No name, identity card, citizenship
They do not exist to the state society
a population of ghosts
<font color=#FAFF00FF>Uncle, what's your name? </font>
<font color=#FAFF00FF>Names are needed for those of you in society</font>
<font color=#FAFF00FF>What do people like me want names for?</font>
Homeless man experiences symbolic death
just no biological death
A ghost is a biological death
but no symbolic death
the dead who were excluded from the symbolic order
Can only return to the world in the form of a ghost
Pursuing unpaid symbolic debts from living persons
Death is not just a biological phenomenon
It also needs to be engraved in the memory of the community community in symbolic form
real death
<font color=#FFEE00FF>Ms. Lin Yongchuan, thank you for your past teaching</font>
<font color=#FFEE00FF>Salute</font>
In "Hamlet"
Hamlet thought his father died suddenly
until the father's ghost returns to find hamlet
Tell him he was poisoned by his uncle Claude who wanted to usurp the throne
Ask Hamlet to avenge him
The world owes a symbolic debt to the father
Because my uncle lied about the cause of my father's death
Until Hamlet succeeds in avenging his father
kill uncle with poisoned sword
Father's last wish fulfilled
Ghosts are really dead
Symbolic Logic of Debt
Expressed more directly in the movie "A Floating Life of Ghosts and Ghosts"
The ghost of the hero's death is obsessed with the note left by his girlfriend
in the movie ending
The moment the ghost sees the text on the note
symbol of debt paid off
The ghost immediately disappears
In "The Hidden Girl"
It is also at the moment that symbolizes the repayment of debts
White Dragon lifts the curse
changed back to the original
same
Pu Yiyong's super power is to use the power of words to pay off symbolic debts
Make the ghosts of the dead willing to leave
let ghosts rest in peace
The opposite of
Wu Mi happened to be unable to say his name
Otherwise you will be cursed and die
<font color=#FDFF00FF>Ghost Dance Master...</font>
<font color=#FDFF00FF>You said the name</font>
<font color=#FDFF00FF>The curse is about to start</font>
Ghosts, unlike humans, long to be symbolized
Miserable but complete negation is symbolized
reflect that he is a completely inhuman being
Symbolic Logic of Debt
Let us re-examine the meaning of ghosts
Ghosts are no longer objects of knowledge
object of ethics
The point is not to use the scientific method to prove the existence of ghosts
but those who see and hear ghosts
what was asked to do to grant the ghost's wish
let him rest in peace
Philosopher De Hida thinks
We should listen carefully to the ghost's request
because of the appearance of ghosts
Let's question the dichotomy of being/not being
Only observable, measurable evidence is valued when scientific inquiry exists
Ghosts are therefore regarded as non-existent and unscientific
But the peculiarity of ghosts is that they cannot be measured with scientific instruments
it doesn't exist, it doesn't exist
but outside of both
Appears only in the field of view of a subject haunted by a ghost
others can't see
when the ghost of father hamlet appeared
his mother can't see
I thought my son was crazy talking to himself
When the obsession of the dead turned into a ghost and came to Pu Yiyong for help
Others can't see these ghosts
Why do ghosts only intrude into someone's subjective world
Instead of appearing in the objective world of the masses?
The reason why ghosts can't fully appear
but only to show someone
because there is some physical existence
Relying on the incomplete existence of this ghost
The reason why Hamlet's uncle exists as a king
It is relying on the absence of the father
The return of the ghost of the father is to tell the truth
But when Hamlet succeeds in revenge
symbolizes when a debt is paid off
There is no need for the father's ghost to continue to be present.
In "Spell Back"
The reason why Satoshi's ghost lingers (presence)
Just because there's another invisible being (not present)
The Unconscious Curse of the Protagonist Yi Gu
<font color=#FFE700FF>It's not Satoshi who cursed you</font>
<font color=#FFE700FF>It's you who cursed Lixiang</font>
<font color=#FFE700FF>Yes</font>
<font color=#FFE700FF>I was there</font>
<font color=#FFE700FF>Refused Satoshi's death</font>
It turns out that Otoko is the offspring of Michizane Sugawara, the three major wraiths in Japan
Can't accept a dead lover leaving
And put a curse on Satoshi
Li Xiang's super wraith is actually the embodiment of Yi Gu's unconscious thoughts
It's not that ghosts are coming back to collect symbolic debts from the living
But the living cannot let go of the dead
demand the presence of ghosts
<font color=#FFEB00FF>There is no more twisted curse than love</font>
It is to lift this curse
Humans have invented various symbolic rituals of mourning
so we can say goodbye to the ones we love
<font color=#FCFF00FF>The job your grandpa did</font>
<font color=#FCFF00FF>He is not just mourning the dead</font>
<font color=#FCFF00FF>He also comforted the living</font>
in ancient times
In every culture there are mourners who weep on behalf of family members
blame the dead for leaving
Express unconscious emotions that family members cannot express
When Yigu made a contract with Lixiang at the cost of his own existence
Unconscious thoughts are also released
As if acknowledging that my inner part died with you
Complete Lixiang's mourning ritual to lift the curse
This is why funerals in many cultures
Family members will be asked to bury hair or nails with the deceased
It symbolizes that a part of oneself dies with the lover
The ghost killing team's ghost killing mission
Also like re-hosting a symbolic funeral for the ghosts
so they can die again
<font color=#FFFE00FF>Please rest in peace</font>
<font color=#FFFE00FF>Xiaosheng's evil ghost technique and drum skills have been recognized</font>
Because ghosts can't kill themselves
Can't be killed by other ghosts
Only Ghost Slayer can make them experience a second death
<font color=#FFF100FF>Let him not become a ghost again when he is reincarnated in this world</font>
These ghost stories have thus become prophecies for contemporary society
A reminder of how modern man has forgotten to mourn loss
The lost object thus becomes a haunting ghost
That's why ghosts are at the time
always out of touch
Ghosts are always stuck in the past
never grow old
as if stuck at the moment they die
haunting people at another point in time
ask people to mourn the past
But ghosts don't just come from the past
Dehida thinks there's another kind of ghost from the future
Europe in the 19th century
Communism is just an ideal
A specter that hovers over Europe
in german
The "spirit" (Geist) of the revolution can also be translated as the "ghost" of the revolution
This ghost haunts the hearts of the masses
cause a massive revolutionary movement
The Paris Commune of 1870 emerged
Why the Paris Commune Exists
Relying on the specter of communism that "doesn't exist"
In "Interstellar Effects"
Daughter notices a ghost in the room
This ghost is regarded as non-existent by the father
It wasn't until my father arrived at a point in the future that he found out
The reason why all this can exist
Relying on the nonexistent ghost
that future self
And the father is through the grammar of the secret room
Let this non-existent ghost communicate with his daughter
The presence of ghosts thus gives us a whole new meaning
remind us all of existence
There's an absent, unacknowledged ghost behind
Because we forget that some things are not done
ghost in time in the future
Haunting the crowd who haven't come yet
Another possibility waiting for people to open history
