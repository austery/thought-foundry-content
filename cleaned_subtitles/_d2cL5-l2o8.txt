Mouthys developed his theory during England's social upheaval. As an Anglican clergyman witnessing rapid population growth alongside industrialization's harsh conditions, he rejected enlightenment optimism about social progress. The French Revolution's radicalism reinforced his conservative outlook. While recurring food shortages made population concerns immediate, his 1798 essay on population proposed that population increases geometrically while food production grows arithmetically, creating an inescapable trap. This mathematical certainty meant poverty was inevitable, not a correctable social problem. Malthusian theory justified minimal poor relief and fundamentally shifted economics by introducing scarcity as a central problem. Though agricultural technology ultimately proved his predictions wrong, his emphasis on natural resource limits remains relevant in environmental economics and sustainability debates. Utilitarianism Jeremy Bentham and John Stewart Mill. Bentham and Mill developed utilitarianism during Britain's industrial transition. Bentham, a legal reformer, became disillusioned with legal fictions while witnessing widespread poverty alongside industrial wealth. Mill subjected to intense education by his father and Bentham, experienced a mental crisis that led him to temper pure rationalism with appreciation for human emotion. Their economic theory proposed that optimal actions maximize utility, the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Bentham's philosopic calculus attempted to quantify pleasure and pain, creating a framework for evaluating policies. Mill distinguished between higher and lower pleasures, emphasizing intellectual satisfaction over physical gratification. Utilitarianism shifted economics from wealth accumulation to human welfare, providing the foundation for costbenefit analysis, consumer theory, and welfare economics. It established utility maximization as the core criterion for economic systems. Marxism Karl Marx. Markx developed his ideas while experiencing industrial capitalism's brutal early phase. Born to a middle-ass Jewish family, he was repeatedly exiled for his political writing. Living in poverty in London, Markx observed horrific factory conditions firsthand. The failed 1848 European revolutions deepened his pessimism about reform within the capitalist system. His economic theory and dos capital focused on class struggle and exploitation. Markx argued capitalists extract surplus value from workers by paying less than the value created. He identified capitalism's contradictions over production crisis, falling profit rates, and wealth concentration, predicting these would cause its collapse. His historical materialism theory argued economic systems evolve through stages based on changing production modes. While his prediction of capitalism's imminent demise proved incorrect, Marx's analysis of exploitation and systemic instability continues to influence thinking about inequality and crisis theory. Marginalism William Stanley Jevans, Carl Manger, Leon Walrus. Marginalism emerged independently through three scholars during the 1870s economic depression. Jevans brought mathematical rigor to economics during Britain's industrial height. Manger developed his theories in Habsburg, Austria and Walrus applied mathematical modeling to markets in France. All three sought scientific precision in an era enthusiastic about classification across disciplines. Their breakthrough introduced marginal utility. the additional satisfaction from consuming one more unit of a good. This marginal revolution shifted focus from production costs to subjective consumer valuations, explaining why diamonds cost more than water despite water's greater necessity. By applying calculus to economic decisions, marginalists showed how individuals rationally allocate resources at the margin. This approach became foundational to modern microeconomics, explaining consumer behavior, optimizing resource allocation, and clarifying how markets establish equilibrium prices. Classical economics. Adam Smith. Smith developed his ideas during the early industrial revolution, witnessing Scotland's transformation from agrarian to manufacturing economy. Raised by a widowed mother and educated at Glasgow and Oxford, Smith was influenced by his mentor Hutcherson's moral philosophy and Hume's empiricism. His European travels exposed him to French physiocrats who opposed mercantalism. His 1776 wealth of nations introduced classical economics with its central invisible hand concept. Individuals pursuing self-interest in free markets unintentionally promote social welfare. Smith championed free trade, division of labor, and minimal government intervention. By observing pin factories, he demonstrated how specialization increases productivity. His work established the foundation for market economies, arguing that natural liberty and economic affairs leads to greater prosperity than government direction. Neocclassical Economics. Alfred Marshall. Marshall developed neocclassical economics during Britain's transition to corporate industrialism. Rebelling against his strict banker father, he pursued mathematics at Cambridge instead of a clerical career. His marriage to pioneering female economist Mary Paley influenced his interest in social improvement. Victorian reform movements shaped his thinking as he regularly visited factories and interviewed business owners. In his 1890 principles of economics, Marshall synthesized classical economics with marginalist insights. His theory introduced analytical tools still used today. Supply and demand curves, elasticity concepts, and consumer producer surplus. Marshall emphasized gradual economic adjustments. Nature makes no leaps and distinguished between shortrun and long run analysis. His partial equilibrium approach examined individual markets while holding broader variables constant. By balancing mathematical rigor with practical relevance, Marshall established the methodological foundation for mainstream economics throughout most of the 20th century. Austrian school Carl Manger Ludvig fiscus Friedrich Hayek. The Austrian school developed amid Habsburg Empire's decline and central Europe's political upheavalss. Manger's work began as a reaction against German historical schools nationalism. Mises and Hayek's defense of free markets was shaped by firstirhand experiences with hyperinflation, socialism and fascism in interwar Austria. Both witnessed political extremism. Mes fled Nazism in 1940. Austrian economic theory emphasizes individualism, subjectivism, and market processes over mathematical models. They view economies as complex systems of individual choices rather than aggregate statistics. Hayek's knowledge problem argues that central planning inevitably fails because economic knowledge is dispersed among individuals. Their business cycle theory attributes downturns to artificial credit expansion. While often outside mainstream economics, Austrian ideas on entrepreneurship, spontaneous market order, and government intervention, dangers significantly influenced libertarian thought and monetary policy debates. Institutional economics, Thorstein. Vevelin's perspective emerged from his Norwegian immigrant background in late 19th century America. His rural upbringing during the populist era's farmer versus banker conflicts fostered skepticism toward financial elites. Witnessing America's guilded age inequality and the extravagant consumption of industrial robber barons shaped his critical stance while repeated academic career setbacks reinforced his outsider position. In the theory of the leisure class 1899, Vevelin introduced conspicuous consumption, purchasing goods to display status rather than fulfill needs. His economic theory viewed behavior as shaped by social institutions and evolutionary processes rather than rational calculation. Vebblelin criticized the disconnect between financial speculation and productive industry, identifying business sabotage as profit-seeking that reduced industrial efficiency by highlighting how social institutions drive economic behavior. Vebblein pioneered evolutionary approaches to economics and provided early insights into consumer psychology, corporate power, and technological change. Keynesian economics. John Maynard Kanes. Keynes developed his revolutionary ideas in response to the Great Depression. Born into Cambridge academic aristocracy, he warned of disastrous consequences from the Versail Treaty's German reparations after serving in the Treasury during World War I. The Interwar Gold standards failure and Britain's persistent unemployment convinced him classical economics needed revision. His Bloomsberry group membership, artists and intellectuals who rejected Victorian values gave him courage to challenge orthodoxy. His 1936 general theory revolutionized macroeconomics by arguing aggregate demand drives economic output and markets don't automatically self-correct during downturns. Kanes demonstrated how rational decisions to save during recessions collectively worsen conditions. The paradox of thrift. He advocated government spending during downturns to stimulate demand when private spending falters. His concepts of multiplier effect, liquidity preference, and effective demand transformed economic analysis. Keynesian economics fundamentally altered government's economic role worldwide and established macroeconomics as a distinct field. Montoriism, Milton Freriedman. Freriedman developed monitoism as an intellectual contrarian during the post-war Keynesian consensus. Born to Jewish immigrant retailers during the depression, his working-class background shaped his belief in individual opportunity over government assistance. America's 1970s stagflation, simultaneous high inflation, and unemployment seemed to validate his critiques of Keynesian policies. While his ideas gained political significance against Soviet communism during the Cold War, Freriedman's theory directly challenged Keynesian dominance, arguing that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon. He attributed the Great Depression primarily to Federal Reserve policy failures rather than market instability. Monitoriism emphasized controlling money supply growth at a steady rate to maintain price stability, rejecting discretionary fiscal policy. Freriedman advocated floating exchange rates, minimal government intervention, and free markets across various domains. His empirically grounded approach transformed monetary economics and central banking practices worldwide, shifting economic policy toward inflation control. New Keynesian economics, Gregory Manu, Olivier Blanchard. New Keynesian economics emerged as scholars sought middle ground during the Keynesian monitoriist debates of the 1970s to 80s. Manu and Blanchard matured professionally during computerization's revolution in economic modeling, allowing more sophisticated mathematical approaches. Their intellectual development occurred alongside rational expectations theories rise and increasing global economic integration while limitations of both pure Keynesian and monetrist policies became apparent. New Keynesian theory maintains Keynes's emphasis on aggregate demand while incorporating microeconomic foundations and rational expectations. It explains market failures through concepts like menu costs, expenses of changing prices, efficiency wages, paying above market wages to increase productivity and price stickiness, resistance of prices to change quickly. These market imperfections prevent immediate market clearing, justifying moderate government intervention during downturns. Unlike traditional Keynesians, they typically favor monetary over fiscal policy. This synthesis has become the dominant framework for contemporary macroeconomic policy, particularly in central banking. Behavioral economics, Daniel Conaman, Richard Thaylor. Behavioral economics emerged from Conaman and Thaylor's unique backgrounds outside mainstream economics. Conne's experiences during Nazi occupied France sparked his interest in decision-making under uncertainty. Trained as a psychologist, he brought experimental methods to economic questions. Taylor noticed as a graduate student that economic theories contradicted everyday behaviors. Their insights gained acceptance following financial crises that discredited irrational market assumptions. Their theory challenges the rational actor assumption by demonstrating systematic decision-making biases. They identified cognitive patterns like loss aversion, fearing losses more than valuing equivalent gains, anchoring, overrelying on first information encountered. Mental accounting, treating money differently based on categorization. and present bias, overvaluing immediate rewards. Thaylor developed nudge theory, showing how choice architecture can guide people toward welfare improving decisions while preserving freedom by incorporating psychological realism into economic models. Behavioral economics has transformed fields from finance to public policy. New institutional economics, Douglas North, Oliver Williamson, Elellanar Astramm. New institutional economics developed as these scholars sought to explain why traditional models failed across different societies. North's merchant seaman experience and economic history research showed how institutions determined development paths. Williamson observed organizational structures that neocclassical economics overlooked. Astramm facing gender barriers in academia studied how marginalized communities successfully managed resources without formal property rights. Their work emerged during decolonization when new nations were establishing institutional frameworks. Their theory examines how institutions formal and informal rules governing human interaction affect economic performance. North demonstrated how property rights, legal systems, and cultural norms determine transaction costs, and growth trajectories. Williamson explained why firms exist when markets could theoretically coordinate activity. Austramm challenged the tragedy of the commons by documenting successful community resource management without privatization or government control. This approach bridged economics with political science and history, explaining development differences between nations and showing economic performance depends on underlying governance structures.
