[Music] hi everyone I'm Nicola tangan the CEO of the Norwegian Sovereign wealth fund and today in the podcast we have James Su the CEO of trip.com warm welcome thank you so much for having me now um I think this is the first podcast you ever done that's right that is so so much fun now you built um trip.com into one of the world largest travel companies um we are the lucky owner or more than 2% of the company or roughly $700 million so you grew up in Shanghai studied in the US so what does travel mean to you travel means quite a lot to me uh maybe I can start with my journey uh on travel I was born in Shanghai and went to pcking University law school and during my second year one of the professors from the USA wanted to come and select one students to go to study in the USA and I was very blessed for the opportunity to go to study in the USA what did it pick you think because I'm always very curious uh and ask questions uh when my professors was presenting so when I arrived in the USA China just opened the door it's a was only early stage of the open door policy uh my parents were both Engineers they made decent living uh to support my brother and myself but if you convert their 200 R&B into USD is $20 per month so so I couldn't ask for money to support myself instead I worked two jobs one in as a librarian uh the other one is as a bus girl to clean up dishes making $3 per hour uh to support myself but after I paid my tuition I have no money for room and boarding but my professor's family were very kind to me they took me in and treated me as their own child so I was very grateful and I told them in China the confusion teaching is that when kids are young parents take good care of their children but when parents get older good children will always take care of their parents so I told them when I'm able to I would like to take good care of you and they said oh honey you don't need to take care of us but instead if you can help the international students in the same way as we do for you will be very happy wow so I what you've done yeah and I was very touched although I was peniles at that time but I always had a dream that someday if I'm able to I would like to establish a scholarship name after my professor and I was very glad in 2016 I went back to my university and established a scholarship to name after the professors who helped me so much and we named our old daughter uh after my professor's wife because she is just like a mother to me and we celebrated her 93's birthday uh last year moving on to trip.com how did you end up there and how did you end up at the top uh in 205 our board was looking for a CFO uh and I was very blessed for the opportunity to become the first female CFO uh in a China Market when I made the decision I asked myself three questions first of all what do you like to spend time uh in Asia uh at that time Asia is growing very fast uh so I thought that's a good market and with my bilingual Background by culture background it's good to be a good bridge between Asia with the rest of the world the second question I ask myself is that if you want to be in Asia what industry do you want to be in and I think I thought the travel industry really brings people together and the third question I ask is that if you want to be in Asia in the travel industry which company has the best opportunity to be successful and after I talk to our board I believe our team are very well equipped uh to take the leadership for the trouble industry why uh why is trip.com so successful internally we have a for formula which we called 55443 three means you are at the market level one and two means you're below the market level four is above Market level but the barrier of entries is relatively lower and five is more above uh way above the market uh so the second player without 5 to 10 years cannot catch up with you so the two elements we assign value five is uh branding and service and why that's important because if you build a service and branding just like Singapore Airlines or four seasons people will trust you and uh travel with you and it's very difficult to catch up with you is that your kind of goal when you think about your brand and the perception are those two Brands something you aspired to be for season 7 sing Airlines yes in travel industry these are very why and why those two brands M because in when you bought Singapore Airline their price is not the lowest it's even you charge a premium but when you when they serve you there are lots of signs behind it yeah for example uh when they ask you a question St ask you a question the eye to ey context is uh uh very good and also when they put down a cup for example instead of put it down walk away they put it down they will move it the little detail behind the scene make customer to connect with your team so I studied and learned a lot from these global leaders uh so in trip.com when you call our call center globally 7 Days times 24 hours a life person will answer the phone within 30 seconds in your native language when there is an issue within 2 minutes our team will find a solution for you when something unexpected delay happened for example there is a tsunami in Japan earthquake in the pool or Middle East had a conflict within 2 minutes our team will reach out to the customers on the ground make sure they are comforted make sure we transfer them to the safe Hotel offer hot meal hot shower and the very next day if our customers would like to come back to their home country we'll make priority around arrangement for them so that's why customer trust us when they travel with us and with that brand preco the most expensive tool we sold cost about 200,000 USD per person per trip 80 Days around the world W and guess how long did it take us to sell these packages not long take a guess how long uh 5 hours very good guess 17 seconds wow yeah the reason we can do that is because of the trust in our brand so tell us give us a feel for the the size of the company so how how do you measure size in your business so in terms of gmv total proceeds where about so that's the total sales of your products correct correct the total proceeds will bring to Airlines to Hotel Partners rental C Business local tour operators attractions that total is about 60 billion USD in terms of our Revenue our commission is about 6 billion USD in 2023 and bottom line is 2 billion Us and how how exactly do you make money we charge a commission uh so when we sell a hotel rooms uh Hotel will pay us a commission as a sales channel so we talked about the two elements with value five the other two elements we value four is technology and products uh we have about 10,000 Engineers globally to invest heavily to innovate our product and take care of our customers but once the product is released uh people can copy it so the barrier of enturies is not as high as service and branding but still it's very important the last elements uh is uh pricing uh we value it at three at the market level uh as the largest player we can always is ask for a very good price for our customers but we never brand ourself as the lowest price leader in the market so when you ask why trip.com you know become a very uh leading player in the travel industry because of our focus in service and branding product and technology and also parity in pricing so when you grow how what are the growth factors um would you have I mean do do you cover now all destinations all Airlines all hotels yes okay yes so our uh growth strategy is to provide a One-Stop shopping platform so for example when a customer fly from Shanghai to Oso if he or she is booking a business class or first class tickets we'll recommend a five-star hotel to to him uh intern InterContinental hotel for example and then we'll calculate the distance between the oso airport to his hotel and send a car to them and when the customer check in we recommend a very nice restaurants for them and after they check in we also say oh by the way we have a toour package for you if you would like to uh travel on the weekend after a business meeting so one stop solution make the travel very pleasant for our customers how uh does your technology compare with competition you mentioned that you would give four but um what type of uh advantages do you have on your technology side our technology uh we invest heavily every year uh we have about 10,000 Engineers uh we use AI to improve our efficiency uh the AI is used for four areas the first one is the user interface uh in the past we need to do search for example I'm coming to Oso with two kids I would like to have a hotel with uh two beds with a swimming pool and then the system will pop up with a couple of selections right now our trip Genie is very Advanced you can just talk to the system and it will pop up automatically the selections for our customers the second usage of AI is the efficiency for our engineering team using co-pilot we'll be able to cut the coding time anywhere between 15% to 30% that's a huge lift of our uh technology team the third one is customer service uh we're able to identify the customer needs within very short time and give them the best selection either automatically or if necessary uh with a live person and the last one is the content generation with the technology in video uh and picture we're able to generate very good uh content uh using technology so we invest heavily to stay ahead how will um this look differently in 10 years time what is what is the future for instance of customer service in the future uh if you look at the past 10 years our grow trajectory is 20 to 30% every year ker but our head count in the call center is very flat the reason we can do it is because of our investment on the backand to support our customers so in the future I think a human intervention is only necessary when there is unexpected events happened hopefully standard transaction can all be handled very smoothly through technology now um customer experience um I think it's so interesting and uh there is this book called unreasonable Hospitality about uh you know this famous uh New York restaurant um now what is the best experience you ever had the best experience I had was uh uh this past Chinese New Year our family went to the South Pole and we call it white desert because without the support uh of uh the aircrafts or this curation is unreachable by human uh so that tells me how important and excellent service is I think the best I had was in a real KH in Kyoto in Japan oh lovely yeah Japan is so famous for the excellent Services absolutely now how do you make sure that um that this service mentality is kind of going through the whole company everybody uh how do you make sure it doesn't slip our young employee when they come to our office uh they most of them are single child because China had this one child policy for a long time they were the center of attention in their family but when they come to our office we train them to treat our customer as their family so the slogan is let our customer hear your smile uh so they are trained to take very good care of our customers do you think it's more difficult to get young people now to have that attitude different years have different challenges when we first established the company uh young people who are from the remote here come here they want to money make money and send it to their family so if you give them enough uh bonuses young people are very very willing uh to work overtime work on the weekend or work on the evening shift now with the living standard is improving money is not the incentive they're looking for instead the career pass is something we can really uh give our young employees to grow so our young employees uh when they start with us if they work well some of them become Buc leading a big operation in our company so I always feel very proud of their achievements within our company how would you characterize your leadership style I'm a a very few female leaders in the high-tech industry and I think women have lots of good traits which we can bring to our team for example uh we are very willing to make personal sacrifice for the best interest of our company uh we're very willing to put ourself in other people's shoes so when we negotiate a deal we very quick can reach a win-win uh agreement we're very good with communication and team building so I really want to uh make sure we pave the way for our future uh female leaders so that they can take on more responsibility now there's a lot of things to drill down on here but um let's start with the negotiations you think women are better at reaching win-win how come I think a a lot of time uh instead of fighting my way or your way with the big eagle uh during the negotiation team when I went to a negotiation conference room normally I just bring our legal council and our finance team three of us happens to be uh ladies uh the other side are full of uh male negotiators with suits very serious so the way we break the deal is to really understand what they're looking for what is the ve very important interest from the other side and how we can meet in the middle so normally the negotiation for for us is to find a common interest are we going to achieve 1+ 1 equals to five it is if it is then the partnership makes sense if 1+ 1 equals two we are better to stay independent so very quickly I think we are able to find our shared interest and maximize our shared interest through our discussion and negotiation you have been very successful in in getting um women at the top of your company right so it's half the leader group I think it's 40% at mid level um how have you done that yeah we have done quite a lot uh to empower woman's leadership for example when a woman is pregnant we offer free taxi to bring them to work and take them home when our employees give birth to a baby we give 50,000 on the baby's birthday consecutively for 5 years and we commit 1 billion uh fund for this initiatives and I also noticed a lot of high talented womens or after they get their master's degrees or phds some of them are 27 or 28 years old but if you ask the doctors they will classify in a pregnancy after 35 years old as highrisk pregnancy so we only giving women 7 to 8 years to build a career build a family have children compared to our male co-workers they have much longer uh career path to build up to that Milestone so we always thought how we can support women better uh so we come up with a policy that if our woman employee would like to use Hightech techology to have their act Frozen we will pay for it and that is very Progressive we the first uh high-tech company who have done it uh so with that consulted efforts uh we have achieved very good results as you said more than 50% of the workforce are women more than 40% of the uh middle managers are woman and more than onethird of the executives are women and I still think we can do better in the future so you mentioned um also you you thought women were more empathetic uh and uh better able to see other people's uh you know situation so how would I experience life differently uh as a normal employee in in you know trip.com relative to your competitors so now I come I come to work right so I work I work for you yeah how how would your style um make me feel how many it make me work yeah so uh for me uh our company really support our employees for 2 hours 2 days and two years 2 hours I think it's very important to give your children your family uninterrupted high quality 2 hours to have dinner with them to help them with their homework so when I arrange my day when I'm not troubling I go to the office very early between 6:00 to 7:00 I'm in the office I get all the mails done uh all my my uh readings then starting from 8:00 my meeting starts and it's very tight when it's 6 to 8:00 I pick pack up all my uh work paper and bring home I have dinner with my family help them with their homework when they were young but when the kids go to bed at about 9:00 us Market opens Europe is doing session so all my overseas call is done when my children are sleeping I work quite long hours but it give me peace in mind knowing every day when I'm home I give them undisrupted two hours uh to help them when they grow up even today now they are in college they're very appreciative of my commitment so 9:00 you start to work again and you work until when ah I work until midnight sometimes if there is a deal we work overnight uh but uh I think being a CEO it can take you 24 hours non-stop being a full-time mother it can also take you 24 hours nonstop but if you want to achieve both I need to invest twice as much as if you choose to do only one thing so that's the two hours per day and if I'm traveling I always try to be home and our employees to to be home to spend the weekends two days with our family and then two years uh for women who are pregnant it's very important to support them during the year when they are pregnant and also during the first year when they breastfeeding the baby if you support them during these two critical years I think there is lots of loyalty from our women uh workers and leaders and we're able to retain talents and talking about leadership um now you've been praised for your crisis management skills right you um ran the company through covid perhaps the most challenging time for a travel company ever right it is what's the key to uh managing a company in time of Crisis so our philosophy is customer first P the second and trip.com the third and if you remember on the Chinese New Year's Eve in 20120 we lock down the border to prevent the disease from spreading and Chinese New Year is always the high high season for travel millions of customers already paid uh their package uh packages uh so they demand a refund but at that time the money already is given uh to the Airlines and hotels so we need to make a very quick decision what do we do customers are innocent they pay the money now they cannot travel but we don't have money we already give it uh to the Airlines and hotels so immediately within five minutes after our executive's decision we made a decision we need to take the leadership provide the for refund to the customer so cumulatively we borrowed 20 billion to advance our refund to the customer now business is back customer really trust us they come back to us the second thing is uh partner the second and during crisis we noticed our small and mediumsized business partners were very short of cash so we established a 2 billion partnership fund to help them with cash flow now businesses back all the partners who would like to team up with us provide the best products to our customers and the third thing is trip.com the third so at that moment our Revenue dropped down to zero yet we have 35,000 employees to feed every employee has a family behind them so we thought about what we can do so our chairman and I volunteered to our board we will take zero salary until industry recovered and our VP immediately echoed with us they said we'll take 50% salary cut and our employees also echoed with us by telling us we will work four days and take one day off or work three days take three day uh take two days off in reality everyone was very busy taking care of our customers we work overtime but that's the way we tell our board and our shareholder we're here together we'll weather the storm together so sure enough after three very difficult years we come back industry is re recovery uh we are able to take our customers to travel around the world again well it's um it's uh a very um strong Testament to your corpor culture now how would you define the corpor culture our corporate control is uh uh customer first uh we need to have have the big company dis discipline and a focus but we also need to have a startup company's passion and Innovation and how do you create that so inside our company uh we have baby tiger program so for example uh small business uh rental car business uh when they started the business it was very small uh we give them a CEO CFO and a CTO they can run as a very small startup company we give them the fun funds we take care of all the uh corporate F factions for example marketing legal uh contract negotiation we have a big uh Team to support them for them they just need to make sure this product is fine tuned very well uh so that enable us to have the ability to launch 70 product simultaneously um but meanwhile our commitment to the customer is the same it's the big com uh uh the big bu like hotel and flight have very matured processes for quality control but just because you're a small business unit you also need to adhere to our principal to put our customer uh in the very center uh position now how do you screen for those type of people how do you what do you look for when you hire so so now you're going to so now applying for a job and I had now have interview with you know the big boss just what kind of questions do you ask me we look at uh the employees for four very important criterias uh the first one is integrity I think of Integrity enable us to have a very open dialogue very transparent and we can work together very well the second one is hardworking because GDP is created by people uh so hardworking spirit is very important the third one is curiosity always ask good questions being very very curious understanding the new trends what our new customers is interested in that enable us to explore new opportunities and the last one is optimistic uh because it as a company you will always have ups and downs how do you screen for optimistic spirit I ask them tell me the the most difficult situation you have how did you handle it that will give me a good sense as to is this employee uh on a positive side when he or she is facing the challenges right it's interesting we did a podcast with Magnus Carlson the world famous chess player and uh he said that the optimistic chess players did better yeah more aggressive and and in the investment Market uh uh you know optimistic investors make more money yeah so what's the most difficult thing you've been through and how did you handle it I think Co is the most difficult thing for the industry uh for for the whole world uh I think we handled it uh very calm uh we also built a very uh strong team uh during covid instead of uh letting people go uh we really focused on how we can run a very lean operation and we were very Innovative even during covid when the hotel are closed down attractions closed down our chairman lead the efforts to dress up in different costumes uh we bring limit uh traffics uh to the hotel resorts upsale for their not only room nights but also meals um because during those time any cash flow to our hotel Partners is very precious so Innovation and a commitment for our industry uh is very important how transparent are you in your company how do you share information we're very transparent uh we our philosophy is we need to scientifically manage our company so number speaking uh we use number uh for all the analysis so a company a bu if they tell me oh the opportunity is great that doesn't get you anywhere you need to show me the number right I've listened to some of your speeches at some of these industry Gatherings and you you talk about numbers all the time because I have a finance background uh so I always focus on numbers so if you show me a very high I of course the uh resources is strongly behind you but but if the II doesn't make any sense no matter how good the story you're telling the team return on investment yes yeah what are the numbers you look at every day I look at uh the industry growth so for example uh we look at the Baseline how fast the GDP grows it is so maybe around 5% and then I also look at the travel industry normally travel industry can be a couple of percentage above GDP growth so somewhere around 8 to 10% and then our team needs to execute very well to grow faster the lead lead the Industry Recovery so we probably will Target at somewhere between 15 to 20% ker going forward and every day you come to work what are the numbers you look at I look at uh the gross proceeds we bring to our business partners that's the most important items I look at moving on to the travel industry just now what are the trends you're seeing the new trend I classify them as three e the first one is event driven so young people are very interested in concerts uh music festivals sports events so events driven uh Travelers is traveling is very popular right now among our young traveler Taylor Swift Taylor Swift is a phenomenal and a lot more uh music uh uh artists the second one is uh a more experiential uh travel so Wellness travel uh ski in the winter diving in the summer hiking in the spring becomes also very important we need to support our customers for these type of uh tools the third one is eco-friendliness travel our young people really focus a lot on that so we offer electronic vehicle for rental cars we encourage our hotel Partners to install a solar panel to reduce emission and in terms of Chinese travel how is that developing just now oh very well uh so we look at both the man side and supply side on the demand side the search volume for overseas alang travel far exceeded 209 level so the demand is there the buying power is there uh I was with the executive in the Dubai airport uh they are telling me that the customers buying power from trip.com is two to three times as high as the average buyers uh in their airport so they love to bring Chinese customers to the aut it help them with their sales volume however on the supply side we still have two major bottleneck the first one is the visa application uh some countries give three Visa uh like AB uh UAE Saudi Arabia Qatar Singapore uh Malaysia Thailand they're doing very well but some other countries still have a long pent demand such as uh Germany has a long waiting list for six months um and some other countries Switzerland does very well within s days you can get the visa if you use expedited Services you can get the visa within the same day so why does Germany have such a long waiting list um you have thought they wanted to have tourists right yeah I think every country wants to you know attract uh Travelers but I think probably the backlog uh through the pandemic time is very high and also they might are looking for uh new working uh uh Power uh to process these back how does No Way St up here no way is in in between right yeah but it's a beautiful country and very this is the first country I visited after Co it's beautiful but how so how long time did you take you to get a visa to come here uh about one month also one month now Mass tourism there's been um a bit of a backlash in many parts of the world just because there are too many tourists right in places like Venice and so on and they're trying to reduce it so what what is your view on that yeah I think uh for very top travel destinations uh we really need to uh provide a good alternative for travelers uh if they have uh the buying power is good for the local economy when we look at the global GDP travel can provide about 10% plus GDP contribution to the global economy and provide more than 10% of the job opportunity so it's very good for local economy but we need to provide uh a good uh uh content for the longtail products for example Italy it's beautiful Rome and Florence is beautiful but so does uh lots of remote areas which is very beautiful as well we need to do a very good job so that's why our content team provides a very good alternative so customers can see not only Rome and Florence they will see sento they will see simani all these beautiful places the world is so big there are so many places you can see just moving on to some more um personal questions um you uh run half marathons that's right I R uh preco I run one or two full Marathon uh on the weekend I try to run a half marathon like every weekend yeah try to wow if I'm not and you came here and you came here on Crites because you uh you've been having a skiing accident as well right that's right so my family in the winter I enjoy skiing in a summer we like to take our children to dive and in Spring and the fall we do a lot of hiking what is your absolute most favorite place to travel I think Africa Safari is my favorite right and what is it with African safari which close to Nature uh if you believe in the origin uh theories of origin uh humans uh moved from Africa to the rest of the world so when we go back to Africa uh we we feel we're going back home M how do you relax um I do lots of exercise I have lots of friends uh I have spent a quality time with my families and I read a lot what do you read when I was young I enjoy toy stor three masterpieces and one piece is my favorite uh now I read uh Henry Kissinger's uh leadership um and I also read a book to help uh Health uh for example outlive uh it's a very good book uh and also antifragile it's good for uh personal uh health and also very good for the health of our company and a community are you going to write a book yes when I have more time and what what will you write about I want to write what I have experienced I think our generation is very blessed uh my grandmother uh she was very talented but she was taught to stay at home to take care of their children and my mother was very talented so they were the generation uh taught uh who were taught woman can hold half of the sky so she became a chemistry engineer but she could only be a individual contributor and in my generation I always feel I'm very blessed for the opportunity we can can go to work we can lead a big team but still there are so many things that we can do more if you look at the global uh Prime Ministers and presidents fewer than 10% of them are represented by woman and I always imagine if we can have 50% of the prime ministers and president represents by woman will we be able to find a better Sol solution a peaceful solution for many of the issues and many of the conflicts well we have a better world because of the representation by half of our population how many women how many mother would like to send their sons to fight a war to sacrifice their sons um so I think there are much more we can do and I want to contribute uh my uh efforts to this course well I think that's a fantastic place to end so a world with more female leaders will be a better world thank you very much for your support thank you so much
