[Music] hi everybody I'm Nicola tangan the CEO of the Norwegian SN wealth fund and today I'm in really good company because I'm here with Ruth porat the president and chief investment officer of alphabet which is the parent company of Google now of course Google needs no introduction but alphabet in addition also makes self-driving cars AI chips it owns YouTube and many more things and we own 1.3% of the company totaling roughly $30 billion so big welcome Ru it's great to be with you thank you who is going to win the AI race well we feel we're um in a really strong position for a number of reasons I think when you look at the history of Google focused on AI uh we started many many years ago and at this point we have a very differentiated approach which starts with the extraordinary team we have led by Demis aabas who obviously just won the Nobel Prize that goes to the strength of the mod models you look at what we're doing on chips with our tpus and then we're already really using it across our various platforms so billions of people are benefiting from AI so this full stack approach we think is an important element that being said what's exciting to see is how much Innovation there is broadly and so what we're looking at is the opportunity I think collectively globally to have an unlock from the upside given the Innovation that we're seeing not just at Google but at other places so is it now a matter of who's got the best people or the most money or the best data or the best chips what is it what is it about well the reason I started with what we're really proud of our full stack approach from talent and models to the platforms and chips is it really is taking this full stack approach and I think very importantly um this intense focus on Innovation and continuing to push forth you know one of the things that really struck me when Demus was awarded the Nobel Prize this last fall and he was asked what was it that really started him on this journey and he said what motivates him is to take on the most intractable what were thought to be the most intractable problems facing humanity and I think that ethos is another really important element of how one continues to drive forth and have the biggest impact with AI do you think generative AI can be monetized the same way as search is I think generative AI is continuing to enable us and others to uh expand kind of the quality of what is being delivered across a a various a wide set of opportunities so just to give you two examples you know I'm often asked where do we where are we investing ex you know extensively and probably not surprisingly you know this well given how close you are to all that we've been doing but search remains so core to who we are and we've evolved search meaningfully over the years and we're continuing to apply generative AI to what is that experience that one has um when you search and what we're finding is that it opens the the types of queries that are being explored it goes for a deeper richer engagement so that's one area the other area that's really important is what we're seeing on the Enterprise side and the abil to help companies and the public sector transform the businesses and their approach whether it's engaging with customers or on the efficiency side or on risk analytics or with constituents each of those provides opportunity for monetization some of your competitors say that you were a bit slow out of the box when it cames to AI models but um your latest Gemini is uh it's it's phenomenal so so what happened here well a search Google search for decades has really stood for Extraordinary quality it's what everybody around the globe expects of us when you go to Google quality answer uh very rapidly surfaced for you in the most potent way and one of the very important questions for us slind talked about this in the early days of generative AI internally we were all talking about uh the risk of hallucination and that term now is very well known quite broadly and one of the concerns is if you in the middle of the night wake up your child is sick you want to figure out how much TI andol to give to a three-year-old there can be no margin for error yeah that's what our brand stands for and so it's very important to us to make sure that as we were evolving and applying generative AI we did it in a way that was consistent with the quality that's expected appropriately from Google and I appreciate your question because what you've seen is the really ongoing momentum in models and introducing models more broadly externally what we've done with for example AI overviews where when you search you'll get this kind of an AI cockpit is the way I like to think about it you're seeing more and things like a model advancement that can be applied in in other uh in other applications and so we're excited about the momentum that people have seen through 2024 and what is ahead in 2025 talking a you told the late you call the latest model for um the model for the agentic area what what does that mean or what what do you put in that so that's one area that I I know SAR and Demis and the team are really excited about which is how can AI actually be an agent working on our behalf how can it help you do some of the administrative tasks that are going to make your life easier and actually free you up to do something else book a reservation for you um research something for you how can it even be applied for example in science to do some of the basic inquiries so set it out to do something to work on your behalf so three three years from now what does your day look like how is it changing your life you know that's it's a great question as it relates broadly to AI I think one of the most um important things for all of us is that AI can really be an assist it can be operating leverage for every one of us you when I started my career on Wall Street how was it as you were moving from Bas you know big computers to laptops to phone this becomes operating leverage if appropriately applied and so what one scientist once said to me that they view this as augmented intelligence not artificial intelligence and wish that had been the word that was used that's what it is for each one of us and I think what's really important is to understand that in fact it's not that we will be replaced by AI in our roles but we can be replaced by someone who's using AI who's getting that operating leverage if we're not and so it's so important for people to just start experimenting just start playing so that you're on that Learning Journey now you make your own AI chips the tpus why could you explain just how they are different from other chips and why why you do this well we work very closely with Nvidia they're a strong partner of ours so we use both gpus and tpus and many years ago the team started on this journey of developing our our own chips tpus to address some of the specific requirements that we felt we needed and what we found is that we continue to have the type of performance that we're looking for in particular in training um and as we've Advanced the tpus what we're seeing is we're continuing to drive greater efficiency in all elements of uh energy requirements with tpus so they there's a cost benefit for us and and impact benefit and so we're using both in the fleet talking about various versions of things so now we've had deep seek um being launched which is uh an open- Source model uh now just how do you look at open versus closed Source models now so open source has been core to Google really for since Inception if you think about something like Android uh which is uh such an important operating system globally it reflects who we are when you think about the trans former paper which has been so critical for anybody who's thinking about how do you build in this AI world like what's the next step to the next iteration so open source has been important to us at the same time this is a really powerful technology and so what we're looking at is how does one maximize upside but have the appropriate guard rails and controls over certain elements of it to ensure that you're protecting how it's used used and where it's used and getting that balance right will continue to be very important for all of us what are you personally most excited about in terms of usage I mean you you talked about um um medicine Alpha fold and so on you you personally what do you what do you feel more strongly about oh I so when we look at at AI I think there are four primary areas that are really exciting um first is the economic upside you know it globally the estimates are there can be 20 trillion added to GDP in the next decade again if appropriately executed if adopted across industry when you think about the benefit to society if in fact we have anything close to that economic uplift I get excited about it it's not to be taken for granted as I said it requires what economists call diffusion across industry adoption a radical rethink of many elements of the way the public sector and the private sector Works excited about that very excited about the breakthroughs in science what Demis aavas and John jumper awarded the Nobel this past fall you know that was for something called Alpha fold which you're familiar with which has been described as the greatest contribution to drug discovery that is exciting then just even sitting here today the Practical applications of AI in health care in education are really exciting um so I would put those at the top of the list now talking about something uh um slightly different you uh before the holiday season sent shocks waves through the world with your willow Quantum chip so why why is that such a leap forward so we've been working on Quantum AI Quantum Computing for quite some time uh well over I think a decade at this point uh and what's really exciting is the computational capabilities with Quantum so the willow chip is able to um to handle a computation in less than 5 minutes that previously on the best supercomputers on the planet today would take 10 septian years which even I had to Google it's it's 24 zeros on the back of it so what that means in terms of the ability to see and analyze more whether it's in biology or other areas is exciting and profound and so we see this as another path that we will continue to execute against how do you view uh Microsoft's version of it uh we're really proud of our own we think that uh that what you've seen time and time again is the breakthroughs from that team led by an extraordinary leader Hartman Nevan um U published in all sorts of different places and we just continue to build success to success with the willow chip being the most recent when do you think this will be commercial yeah that's a great question not surprisingly I ask that question all the time as well and have been for um some time you know I think it's there's still a number of years ahead it's starting to to point to different applications that we're excited about but whether we're three years five years you know hard to say uh but it's it's getting closer since I started asking that question and when when you talk about these kind of 24 zeros uh uh and so on just what are the what are the implications for what are the kind of things we can do when we have that kind of compute power well when you think about it take something like the human body and the complexity of the human body or anything in nature that's you know multi-dimensional um the ability to actually crunch data more efficiently to have better insights is one area that's very exciting for for us to think about and the possibilities that come from that and other things where you are where you are strong is a self uh self-driving taxi company now I'm not sure what the latest number is in terms of rides per week where where are you now it's uh 200,000 rides paid rides so what will the city look like in 5 years time or 10 years time when do you think it would be properly rolled out well I think if I just step back and talk a bit about wayo because we are very excited about it you know we started on that Journey more than a decade ago as well and the original thesis is that more than a million people die on the road every year in accidents and if AI can help improve the safety of driving because our wayo self- driver the AI does not get tired it does not get distracted it you know it stays focused on the road you've got camera sensors everywhere we can improve safety we can help save lives and that was a really exciting motivator for the team we've been rolling it out it's been extraordinary to see the takeup it's now one of the top attractions in San Francisco if anyone's out this way but we're also in LA in Phoenix and Austin and expanding and we're going to continue to expand because you see both the um the reaction to it when people get in some people are anxious about it at first and then within literally under a minute they see they they just go right into to whatever it is they wanted to be doing there's a safety element around it uh so we think it'll continue to be rolled out uh we're doing a pilot in Japan right now and there's an opportunity we think to help save lives and are excited about doing that so 10 years from now who is going to own a car you know I think it's too early to call um I you know a couple of reasons one many people in particular in the states other developed markets own more than one car they're good reasons to own a car uh and so we'll see human human nature and human behavior changes over time the other is that weo is primarily now focused on what are these Robo taxis as you described it but it's it's reasonable to assume that this capability this extraordinary technology can also be an assist with um with cars that are owned and so there are a lot of execution paths which enable you me others to decide how they actually want to get around now you're also the chief investment officer and you are uh in a very fortunate position in that you are sitting on roughly hundred billion dollars and you have all these interesting areas just how do you allocate Capital between them so Capital allocation like I think one of the core elements in capital allocation is that you need to ensure that you're continuing to invest aggressively for the long run um if you don't invest for the long run you're sewing the seeds of your own destruction and that's a lesson I've seen throughout my career over and over and so very important it's been core to the ethos obviously of this company since Inception the early days there was a a a kind of a mantra which is 70 in your core 20% adjacent 10% moonshots and that's evolved over time but this core sense of you've got to continue to invest aggressively for the long run remains core to who we are and we're at such an exciting time in history given the opportunity with AI you know both on the consumer side on the Enterprise side so we're certainly making Investments there I end up spending a lot of my time globally because what is really key is every head of state is saying the same type of thing which is I want to be a part of this digital transformation it is key for all the reasons that we've already talked about and so what we spend time looking at is as we're continuing to invest in our technical infrastructure globally in other words data centers subc cables how do we link up the world the the the opportunity is how do we engage more deeply how what work are we doing on their behalf to help accelerate their digital transformation how do we engage on the public C side and so there's a really global view to this now you you have this moonshot Factory in house what are the type of things you're working on there so the moonshot factory as it was lovingly named years ago um uh is the core one of the core areas within other bets it's called X and out of X came for example whmo it was incubated in X and then got um moved out to become an independent uh company they've also worked on for example Wing or incubated Wing which is our drone business excited about Wing they're doing work as an example with Walmart and we're seeing uh really exciting results there and see the upside they're also incub they've been incubating and you'll hear more about a company called intrinsic which is a robotics um operating system and so they have a number of different things that they've been working on I think one of the very important ele elements there is that when um they are approaching any incubation their mindset is obviously you can't incubate everything and have it work well and so kill things fast in order to move into the areas that are the most promising that sounds really fun I think it was Charlie Monger who said that Google appeared like a very rich kindergarten well it's we've got everything from kindergarten all the way through to postgraduate robotics now you mentioned um uh sub cables the fact that you also do subsy cables and so on does it make you more resilient you think as a tech company I think there are a lot of elements that build resilience and one of the are one of the important areas is continuing to invest in subc cables but it's also the what we call technical infrastructure more broadly so it's data center resilience data center redundancy so that you can actually be positioned to serve customers when and where needed and in the event of something that happens and things unfortunately always seem to happen around the world you've got the resilience needed to continue to operate at a high level it's our cyber security defenses one of the things I've learned in my career is is much easier to prevent than to fix a problem and so building in this strength upfront is key and it's technical infrastructure I can I'm happy to talk more about cables because really proud of the network we have globally but it's the other elements like a zero trust approach on cyber security so that you're fortifying defenses in a world that is continuing to become ever more challenging and I think that's one of the key additional applications of AI that's important and how do you look at these additional challenges I mean we are seeing attacks on subsy cables we are seeing of course accelerating cyber attacks how do you how do you assess the state of the world uh it's better to remain paranoid which we do and build in resilience as you said and so when we're looking at our subc cable network we uh do build in resilience to have alternate approaches we're building globally we've been building now in the southern hemisphere as well um when we build cables as an example one of the things that has multiple benefits is we will build what I will call a trunk from say Africa to Australia and then we will have it in chunks with nodes along the way that builds in a resilience for the cable itself but it also provides something else that we're really proud of it provides the ability off of a node to light up island nations along the way oftentimes working with governments that say we want to help light up a nation which maybe Google otherwise wouldn't so as an example one of the ones I'm really proud of is when we lit up Fiji uh and I was talking about this at the Asia Pacific economic um conference and we had the prime minister of Fiji happen to be in the room I said we lit up Fiji and his comment was it was a gift to everyone in Fiji because what that does is link them to all the opportunities that come otherwise from being having access and what's really important to remember is a third of the globe still is not online still is not connected so this gives us that added ability to provide something that as he described is an economic opportunity for Fiji for generations to come with all um these tech companies chasing the opportunities here do you think tech companies are now accepting lower returns for their Investments well I think that at this point what we're all looking at is this theoretical economic upside which assuming it materializes creates the opportunity for attractive returns and I think there's a self-calibrating element to the pace of investment that comes from that thesis now when I said you know 20 trillion theoretical economic upside globally it's four trillion in the us alone what is it require to get that you know it's not applying using chat Bots it's actually radically rethinking every element of your business it's how do you interact with with customers to drive more Revenue it's what are operating efficiencies in the business it's what are risk analytics thinking front to back on your operating processes because this gives you an opportunity to approach them differently that's what leads to that the economic upside which then drives the returns and so I think that uh it's we've each got to make sure that we're we're calibrating as we go regarding the upside and then the other part to your question about returns that we're very focused on and others are as well is how do you increase the efficiency of that denominator all the capex that it's being invested and so we're approaching that in a number of ways Sundar talked about it the meaningful improvements in model efficiency the meaningful improvements you've already asked about in tpus our Trillium chip our most recent chip is about 67% more efficient than the prior one so we're continuing to drive efficiency in the cap capex utilization while also trying to help unlock um really that monetization upside now related to this is is the corpor culture and how you structure Innovation is there a particular way that you structure Innovation at Google it's been such a core part of who we are I think the driver of everything that we do and there are elements of it that are about how we bring in bring in Talent and and apply them to explore uh different Avenues we have an extraordinary research team as an example everything that's being done in Google deepmind the demises leading and then on top of that we have efforts I think more to your question for example in the early days of Google there was something called Google Labs small Scrappy teams and told go find something and Sundar reconstituted that a couple of years ago and you've seen already a number of really exciting things come out of a small Scrappy f focused empowered team so for example hopefully you and others listening have used notebook LM it's one of my favorite it's the opportunity to take your own your content speeches you're interested in anything you're interested in ingested into notebook LM it can give you some of the information that you need but you can also listen to it as an AI podcast that can make things sort of more accessible maybe within an Enterprise or I've talked to some people in the public sector and their wow moment was wow you mean I can take all these things that we publish that people probably don't read and make it easier for them to ingest the information the answer is yes it was the time Innovation product innovation of the year last year and that's an example of something that came out of of lab so we're continuing to add- on in a lot of different ways to make sure we're inspiring people to dream big and think big but if I walk around at Google and let's say now you took down all the Google signs I mean you got a Google sign behind you right you take away all the G's all the Google signs just how would I how would I know that I was in Google how do you do you relate to each other in a different way do you talk to each other in a different way do you behave in a different way compared to the other tech companies I have so many different ways to answer that when I when I first got here I saw how different it was in the way we worked and granted I was coming from a financial institution not another tech company but it's literally embedded in the technology that we use so it just starts right from square one with Google Docs collaborative docs every every way we're constantly interacting and it just adds a velocity to the work that you do U right across the street from me here we have a wonderful building that we we put up recently uh that that is where our our AI team gdm Google be mind team is operating you just see people constantly coming together in ways that are exactly what the founders talked about at Inception it's about serendipity and the joy that comes from that but then it is in the mindset that goes through our people Ops and our workplace Services teams to have s dipity in a lot of places so that people do congregate and exchange ideas but I think the core point is it's the ethos from the people come in there's a high bar that's set we want to make the maximum difference to humanity that's what we talk about a lot it's you know I I'll give you one more Demus story um when he was embarking on Alpha fold and the concept of predicting the protein structure for every protein known to humanity previously it would take a year or two just to do one he wanted to do all 200 million it was one of the grand challenges that had been out there for a long time and some scientists said how could this be possible and his answer was why not and that ethos that why not is a large part of how I answer your question and you hear it in meetings it's like why not take it on so that to me is is the explainer so um tell me about a time recently when you learned something about a project and you just thought wow this is just like way cool or does it happen all the time it does frankly that's why I'm like where do I go you know it's um you know when I saw notebook LM I'm like wow this is really amazing though the ability and starting to think about what are all the applications I remember calling the guy who runs Google Labs is extraordinary and I said if I'm if I'm running a government can I ingest report from across agencies and see where their inconsistencies he's like why not yes I'm going back to the why not Point uh so that's really exciting uh you know a little further back this was years ago actually but we now have 20 billion searches a month using your camera with Google Lens if I want your shirt you know I can take a photo of it and then I can find where to buy it and priced and everything else or I can I do with other things like art who's that artist I still get an ohow moment from that I ride Whos all the time in San Francisco and you know I always tell people when I'm in the car watch the left turn because the left turn that's like that's really that's pretty cool and gives you a sense of what the engineers have accomplished so I think the awe of what the team continues to do is there constantly and then and then there are the human moments like I am completely in awe of what we're able to do with Healthcare and you because you had you had breast cancer right exactly had breast cancer twice actually and Google the amazing Engineers identified um the opportunity to diagnose early stage metastatic breast cancer and what's extraordinary is in the testing of it they found that relative to the 80,000 sample set they found 20% more cases more incidences of cancer and no false positives and as we all know the difference between survival or not or a really difficult course of treatment at stage four versus two is really meaningful and so the ability I still have a wow moment with that that we with AI and with breakthroughs like that can give people the opportunity for the early diagnosis that's needed and what's really important in discussing this with my oncologist he said what it does is it enables any doctor anywhere across the us around the globe to be operating at the highest level because they have this this assist this augmented intelligence to me that becomes an extraordinary wow moment when you think about what we can do and we're doing it not just in breast cancer there's early diagnosis in lung cancer in something called diabetic retinopathy which is Blindness from diabetes and in that instance early detection leads to early intervention that's manageable around the globe many places you know early detection isn't the Panacea it's not an answer it's an assist but then you need the rest of the treatment as well so there are a lot of wow moments that come um and I think it goes back to the importance of each of us asking how can we apply it well thanks for sharing that now how has the culture de evolved during the during your time at Google you know when I got here I think the one of the first questions I asked because I I've always believed that culture is more important than rules regulations coming from a regulated Financial Services environment it's such an important explainer and so I that's where I spent some of my early time asking people so how do you define the culture and I do think it comes back to inquisitive people who are who believe that with technology we can have a positive impact on Humanity it's not a Panacea but we're technology optimists we always we often use that phrase and you know it goes back to deus's comment I want to take on the most intractable problems in society that's very much the ethos of the founders of what sundar's been pushing and it's what I've seen throughout and I think it's what is inspiring um for a lot of what we've done and I've seen the application of it so when I got here as a former Banker I was very excited to look under the hood and see so what really are the numbers the Mantra as you may recall back in 2015 when I arrived was the desktop is dead can Google actually make the transition to mobile and who knows about YouTube and it was sort of we've been sort of sliding for a bit and obviously history has shown the application of Solutions on mobile has been it's been a pretty wonderful decade and it's that intense focus on Innovation and providing better ways for advertisers for people around the globe to use mobile get what they want access how and where they it's this Innovation cycle that we've continued to see and so I got here 2015 the market cap was 400 billion it's now north of two trillion and I think to that questioning back then um and yet the whole series of innovation that we've seen since then and that is the evolution and it's been this recurring let's keep pushing it and there's another really important element and I think it's two sides of the same coin which is there's an incredible humility here a sense every year that this is the last great year and that started the moment I got here and I remember as I was listening to the stories like well they're all these headwinds they're always headwinds and so that humility I think inspires people to push higher on for themselves and their team and try and figure out what else can we do um and that's been an ethos I think search for Innovation coupled with humility how do you install humility in an organization it starts from the tone from the top I mean if you look at Sundar as a leader he brings this um integrity and Ethos about him and that's the expectation uh I think for the entire team we are privileged to be at this moment in history with the opportunity set that we've talked about and we better approach it responsibly and boldly to have the right to continue to execute in the way that we are I think it's it's got to come tone from the top do you think it makes a difference that the founders are still around well I think it's been you know Sergey in particular um at the couple years ago as the team was pushing forth on on Gemini uh was very engaged and back in uh sitting with them and he made a comment that this is the most exciting time in computer science that we had only just scratched the surface previously and when you think Google's done pretty well like when he first said that to me I got chills because I think about how much has been accomplished by Google but that level of excitement and the magic of what's to come you know has to be infectious um for every one and so it's been yeah it's been a joy I just saw him um uh in an interview saying that uh 60 hour work during the week is perfect that's where you have your optimal production and Innovation and creativity so he's yes he's certainly motivated and uh as I said he's vieing this is the most exciting time in computer science I think that when you look at uh the that building over there that I described with uh the Google deepmind team team and the effort everyone's focused in it people are working because they're getting a real charge out of what they're doing and you don't need to tell you or me how many hours to work you know there's a joy that comes from it you know at at Google we're still um of the view that the way we get the best outcome is we want people in three days or more a week and teams can figure out what works best for them to get maximum kind of Maximum productivity progress who do you hire really smart people and uh it's a it remains a a rigorous process the number of applicants remains you know daunting um I think that depending on the area you know there's there's a mix of um I you know what I would say what I would look for is a mix of those people who um come with what I will call pattern recognition the experience that gives you a sense that of predicting what's going to come from here or very specific domain expertise but then evidence uh high performance and creativity pushing themselves achieving achieving remarkable things along the way talking of which uh Ruth you've uh achieved remarkable things uh and you worked in Morgan Stanley before you before you joined Google uh and you were there during the financial crisis and uh uh did a did an incredible job what did you what did you learn from the financial crisis because you were really involved at the very top yeah I learned a I learned a lot at the the time I was running the financial institutions Group which meant responsible for banks insurance companies Asset Management I was on the investment banking side and one of the most privileged times in my career is when secretary Hank pulson Secretary of the Treasury gon said he wanted a team to basically be Sanda down um at US Treasury and initially we went I went down in in July of' 08 to focus on the housing crisis Fanny May Freddy Mack and to try and understand understand and diagnose what could be a trigger for what we would call a run on the bank run on on agencies so we went through Fanny May Freddy Mack with him and then I led the group that went um through the AIG crisis as well and then onward and there were a lot of really important lessons that came out of it and when I got to Google I was asked about them which struck me as a bit odd because Google had only seen sunny days and I think really importantly the lessons are good for good times and bad and for said it is easier to to fortify oneself ahead of an issue to prevent than to deal with it in the moment the first most the most important lesson from the crisis is to identify your greatest source of vulnerability ahead of time and protect against it so for financial institutions that would be liquidity without liquidity nothing you couldn't operate and in that moment in that September October 2008 moment you couldn't procure liquidity durable liquidity if you tried and we did and you couldn't um but six months prior you could have and I think a really important lesson for everyone is do that question what is your greatest source of vulnerability you can protect against it early on but not in the moment the second really came out of AIG as we now all know the crisis in AIG really started because of the derivative sub in the UK not the op not the insurance operation and the problem was there wasn't visibility about the risk that was being taken on by the derivative sub and so the metaphor that I've used since then is you would not drive a car with mud on the windshield you cannot run a business or a country with mud on the windshield use data and analytics to clear away that mud and then you can actually go faster because you're taking calculated risk you're taking swor risk I think the other really important lesson uh was that there are no good choices in a crisis and so go for the least worst and just keep moving because standing still can actually just amplify magnify and you're not going to end up with a good solution in any event by definition you're in a crisis say actually the last one is make sure you have a team with horizontal Vision because you got to connect the dots across a lot of different issues it's a lot of wisdom here now how do you protect the Google against future vulnerability so I asked myself that I then said okay I need to apply those same rules here I think the greatest source of vulnerability for us and frankly really across Industries is around Innovation and long-term investing and notably when you come to campus um you will see that Larry and Sergey put a dinosaur on our campus that it's name Stan to remind us every day that if we don't innovate we too can become dinosaurs and I think it's really important to maintain um efforts like what sunar did with Labs Google Labs other things that are continual Catalyst to continue to really SP spur small teams to think big and and also from a capital allocation perspective to make sure you're investing for long-term long-term growth talking a bit about the personal growth you worked with what is called the trillion dollar coach Bill Campbell who has uh well worked with a lot of in successful people but how did you how did you end up working with him and just what did you learn from him so when I was at Morgan Stanley I've always had this view in life that I should ask what's my highest and best use and keep learning and I loved being CFO with James Gorman he was an absolutely extraordinary CEO I joined him as his CFO the day he began as C we we we've had him on the podcast and I fully agree extraordinary person EX so I started his his CFO January 1st 2010 the day he started as CEO but after about five years I thought you know I feel like I'm plateauing here and I'm wondering what my next chapter is and as you said Bill Campbell is um one of the most extraordinary people that anyone could meet trillion dollar coach because he had coached Steve Jobs and Larry and Sergey um and I sat down with him and said I don't know what my next chapter should be and I'd love to get your thinking about it I was out at a Stanford board meeting where I'd served for years and so got together at his house and we spent a couple hours together and he started by saying so the one thing you know is you won't leave Morgan Stanley as CFO to be CFO anywhere else and I'm like that's the only thing I know but what's the next chapter and at the end of the two hours he said I have the perfect role for you CFO of Google we both sort of laughed because I had been so adamant the one thing I wouldn't do was be CFO again I'm like if it's Google of course I had run Tech banking at Morgan Stanley involved with the Google IPO loved Google for years and um so that's how I ended up here and then he was always an adviser who was here on campus and just the wise Voice who um was blunt and clear and when something didn't make sense you know he was famous for saying kind of throwing the flag on the field um and just truly brought out the best in everyone made told each of us make sure you always have that human connection and then go into the business item he tragically passed away with cancer shortly after I arrived uh but it was a he is a gift that is a gift that keeps giving do you Mentor people yes what's the key to good mentorship well I think you know when I when you asked that question I immediately thought of one of the most important discussions I had with someone who ended up becoming with a mentor sponsor uh a key person in my career and it was back in 1996 and I was asked to uh lead technology Equity Capital markets the part within a bank that's between Banking and sales and trading that really launches IPOs and this was right at the beginning of the whole internet run of IPOs there were not very many women on the trading floor and the guy who ran institutional equities called me into his office and he said I think you're going to soar but if you stumble I'm here I will back stop you I am your senior air cover and what really struck me is that we all need senior air cover and we all need to be senior air cover for someone and what he was saying is I know you're going to run far and you're going to run hard and but I'm here if there's ever an issue if you need me for something something and so for me on people who work hard for me and I see this is a star who needs to be sort of unleash to run to to soar um I try and give them the advice that I think has served me best throughout my career and it's about continuing to learn and have that senior air cover and really apply data and Analysis to everything you do and I just keep coming back to those rules in particular I think it's so important we each have SE air cover and our senior air cover did you have a need air cover you know there was I was I've reflected on did I actually run into issues there were small ones there wasn't a crisis moment where I needed to go to him but the insurance policy of knowing he was there and the message that he said I know you'll soar but I'm here to back stop you in case there's an issue is actually a real Catalyst it's empowering you mentioned um the need and wish to continue to learn what are you what are you most exciting about learning now well there's there's a there's so much when I talk about AI in this moment and the conversations I'm having globally about the economic unlock the real question is what does it mean to radically rethink your business or radically rethink the way you run the public sector you know I've had quite a number at this point of public sector leaders Finance minist who said I'm not going to get more budget how do I get more out of my budget and really trying to get drill into what can we do that makes a difference how can we be specific so for example one of my favorite in the state of Minnesota they wanted to do a better job delivering services to their constituents and they came to us and said um we can you help us in four of our critical we have four critical languages in Minnesota we said of course Google translate 250 languages no problem there we're going to help you rethink how you engage within six months they came back and they said actually we need another 26 languages now that Minesota experience for me can be repeated over and over around the globe like how do you interact better with customers constituents but there's more to it about efficiency unlock so I I'm just a I think we're at this very early stage of something that's huge and possible and excited to make sure that I understand how does it actually work and what are the implications how do you relax um I love what I do so that's source of relaxation and then beyond that you know there's the biggest Joy is family and kids U taking hikes with my kids I've got a book club with my kids comparing notes on books had dinner with one of my kids last night it's um everything that we can do together travel explore new places um and I work out last question so we both went to Wharton and if you were giving the commencement speech which I'm actually doing in May uh what would you be telling The Graduate students you know I actually did do that a number of years ago and what would you tell them now I mean have you changed your mind probably not because I think the core principles for me never stop learning my father was a holocaust Refugee he had no high school or college education he ended up up enlisting in the British Army and he fought in the two battles of aliman and he taught himself engineering and physics because he knew or he assumed that if he survived he wanted to get to a place that was safe and he needed a skill that people would value and he thought engineering and physics would be that skill and as a child he always told me that his fellow soldiers would tease him and say you're going to be dead before you can ever use this and he would say I'd rather die an educated man and then the lesson for me as a child my siblings was education as a passport for life and I firmly believe that and I think that one of the most important things is never stop learning so that's why I said when I found myself plateau in my career I would go to somebody I respected and say what is my highest and best use and I was open to change and continuing to grow I think that's one really important one the other is Anchor everything everything in data at Wharton you clearly get great analytical skills a lot of other places as well you can argue with me in my approach to something but you can't argue with data and I always say don't give me flat data put it into a sensitivity analysis so that we can debate your assumptions about the state of the world growth rates how much do I need to invest let me engage you with the data and that should be the basis for the argument and then the other thing I believe I told them and I believe it is today as I did then is Embrace Life as it comes don't defer to a later time something which you can do now because as I saw with cancer you don't know if you're gonna have that later time unfortunately that was 20 years ago and I'm fine but in the moment I didn't know but I was grateful my bucket list wasn't very long I had done what I wanted been married to the same guy for many many decades have three amazing kids I Professional Care I wanted don't put it off because life doesn't actually stick to your predes predefined schedule well Ru that's uh uh really motivational and beautiful place to to end this podcast big thanks for being with us and thanks for sharing sharing all your thoughts and backgrounds thank you so much you it is always wonderful being with you thank you for having me thank you
