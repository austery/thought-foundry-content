then we'll start right away
My way is this
that's how i summed it up
The experience of the films I have made in the past few years
That is, I summed it up into several thinking modes that I think are very practical
introduce to everyone
why use this way
It's actually a very British way of teaching
when i was studying in england
This British professor
They last about an hour per class
It's about 5 to 10 minutes at the end.
They'll say now you have something you have to take
It doesn't matter if you forget the first 40 minutes of the whole class
But the thing I'm talking about now is something you can take back directly
So this is why the British pay great attention to this practicality
He doesn't want you to spend hundreds of thousands of tuition fees to study in the UK
and you didn't take anything back
It's unimaginable for them
ok so i'm going to use a list method today
Let me introduce you to the past few years
Some ways of thinking that I often use
And then there are these ways of thinking
After I went to study in London, England
what changes have taken place
Well first of all, let's take a look
when I was doing philosophy films
What is the philosophical thinking used
What is good philosophical thinking?
Let's start with a random topic
Then I use philosophical thinking to analyze and look at this topic
you know what philosophical thinking is
I would like to ask everyone about the recent society in Taiwan
What are the more popular topics?
Because actually I just came back from England
I don't really know what Taiwanese are obsessed with now
I know it was talked about about a month ago
What weird religious group thing does entertainers get into
But this month I don't know what everyone is passionate about
Scratch hahaha
Someone's scratching it?
scratch off scratch
doesn't this happen every year
Hahaha
good
Is this something Taiwanese are currently discussing?
Aboriginal bonus points
The aborigines have been arguing for nearly 20 to 30 years to add points
and recently ran out
good
Ah, when I asked in Taiwan
they talk about something
They said that recently just after the end of the Chinese New Year
Then everyone is arguing
Everyone is arguing about one thing
That is, the government wants to reissue 6,000 yuan.
Then this group of people say no
The government should spend the money on some public facilities.
public works
Then the other party said no
I want to take this 6,000 yuan and share it with everyone
Because of the epidemic, the economy is too boring
Okay, so there are two voices
OK, let's now look at philosophical thinking.
If it was Descartes, what would he think about this matter?
First of all, Descartes would ask
what is the source of this information please
That is, what source did you collect this information from?
must be two
either the news media
either social media
Like Facebook and IG
ok now
Many people told me that there are two voices in Taiwan
One faction is in favor of universal distribution and the other is not in favor of universal distribution
Where did these sounds come from?
It's very simple, just read the comments under the news on Facebook
ok, now i'm asking the audience
Who is in the audience
I once left a message under the news of the news
this one
wow i finally found it
so many speeches
never met one
Someone who will leave a message under the news
You may be a very special existence
Basically I ask this question every time I go to large and small speeches
The vast majority of viewers told me no.
This is the first person who will leave a message under the news
ok then i have a question
If most people don't comment on the news
So who is leaving the message under the news we saw?
It's very likely that it's the Net Army
for advertising or
Or the forces on my side
ok so the result is
The following message is actually not the voice of a real Taiwanese.
People nowadays are actually certain people, whether it is the editor
whether it's a robot
Whether it is the voice that the cyber army wants you to see
Then
Some viewers will come over and say that Taiwanese are arguing about this
In fact, there is no, in fact, the cyber army wants Taiwanese to see this thing
So we actually don't know what the real voice of the Taiwanese is
How many people support a How many people support b
we don't know
This is very Cartesian thinking
Descartes says
when we do anything
we all have to imagine one thing
We all have to imagine an evil spirit
would try to trick us
Trying to trick us no matter what we do
So Descartes said
For example, when I drink water
Like I just went to buy a big garden
Then I put the straw in
Just put a straw in and have a look.
The straw is broken
become folded
But I picked up the straw and he didn't fold it.
represents what
means my eyes can lie to me
Human senses are unreliable
Sensory perception is not reliable
Descartes goes on
All customs and cultural traditions are also unreliable
think about it
For example, the Chinese are very particular about family values ​​and filial piety.
But what?
If you look at the Christian culture in Europe and America, it is completely opposite
What they emphasize is that the Bible says that people should leave their parents
Then go out and start a family by yourself
You will see two completely different traditional values
now ask who is right
It's not a matter of who is right and who is wrong
You can't say which customs and culture are more noble
or more correct or closer to the truth
So this means
All human self-set values ​​are unreliable
Because you can set whatever you want
Any culture can be arranged, it can be set up however it wants
that's not reliable
it just needs to be sui generis
You can't say which culture is closer to the truth
So Descartes said
We cannot find truth from cultural values ​​set by humans themselves
So this cultural value may also be that evil spirit wants to deceive us
Trick us into this cultural system
But this is not philosophical thinking
Because what is philosophical thinking?
He should find a way to pursue the eternal truth
Like family values, maybe they won't exist in 100 years
Because of the relationship of modernization, no one will be pursuing this thing in 100 years.
Maybe only our grandparents would pursue
But it's not something that lasts forever
If it is not eternal it will only exist for 10 years
how can it be called truth
Let's say you only exist on this earth for 100 years
then disappeared
will anyone remember you
then you have nothing to do with the truth
But what Descartes wanted to pursue was the eternal truth
so what to do
Descartes finally pushed to the extreme
He said, even if we are in real life
Anything you encounter every day may be false
why
because how do you know you're not dreaming
Like the day before I came to speak
then i had a dream
dream i'm giving a speech
And then halfway through my speech
My mask is cracked
My mask is cracked
Then the audience below panicked
and then i panicked
Just woke up from the whole nightmare
So now I am in the same scene again
and watch you speak
How can I be sure it's not a dream?
maybe it's just a dream
Then wait a minute and my mask cracks again
I wake up again
and then just keep repeating the process
It's basically the concept of a full launch.
Full boot is the heroine
Leonardo's girlfriend
His wife never believed this was the real world
so what is she going to do she is going to kill herself
Then jump to jump out of this world
It's basically a very Cartesian way of thinking
Descartes pushed it to the extreme and discovered that there is one thing that cannot be doubted
what is this
It's just that he's been skeptical
all the things that happened to him
all real world stuff
this matter cannot be doubted
He suspected at first that the senses were unreliable
Later, I suspect that human customs and culture are also unreliable
Then I suspect that the whole reality is unreliable
because it was all a dream
So he has been skeptical and skeptical until finally he finds that there is one thing that cannot be doubted
this is my past time
This thing I've always suspected
Why can't this matter be doubted?
because if you doubt it
Don't you doubt it even more?
So you're using more of your ability to doubt
using more human rationality
So the ultimate basis for philosophizing
It's this rational skepticism
If it is before I go abroad
I would present Descartes' philosophy to my audience like this
Then you have to be clear about one thing
The philosophy of Cartesian rationalism
It has dominated the entire philosophical trend of thought in the West since the 17th century.
so basically
The reason why we can have so-called science and technology now
It was Descartes who established the subject of rationalism
and think about the world in this way
Only then will there be the technology of science and philosophy behind
That's why there are achievements in Western civilization
If there is no such subject first established
So basically everyone is still living like
A world like each culture's own tradition
Then here comes the problem
In fact, Descartes' theory just now
there is a big loophole
Do you want to guess what the loophole is?
ok let me add
Descartes' theory has a very important conclusion
That is, he said that there is one thing in the end that cannot be doubted
called this thing i'm doubting
that is doubting
is an activity of human thinking ability
So basically it's a rational ability
Descartes called this thing the cogito
So he said I think therefore I am
the "cogito"
It has a very important premise that
it cannot be any material existence
Because if you think of the "I think" as the human brain
you got it wrong
because the brain is a substance
Descartes already said
As long as it is material, it may be seen in a dream
that's why you got scammed
you got scammed again
So the cogito cannot be the brain
What does it look like?
When some philosophy books introduce this concept,
would say it's a bit like the concept of a soul
But the concept of the soul is actually not accurate
So what do we mean when we say soul?
If I tell you about the soul, what do you think of?
what's on your mind
It's another me but it's a bit transparent
But if you think so, you're wrong
because this version of my soul
Does he have clothes, hair, and a brain?
these are physical
If these are all material
It is possible that Descartes said that you are still dreaming
Dream about these things
These things may all be fake
So Descartes' cogito cannot have any physical substance at all
it is an immaterial being
So it doesn't care about any space at all
So the conclusions he draws are actually very radical.
He believes that the soul of human beings is the rational ability of human beings
It's actually a completely immaterial thing.
where the hell is it
have no idea
There is a very big problem with his theory
Can anyone figure out what's wrong with him?
In fact, there are 3 very large loopholes in total.
But if you can catch one, it's pretty awesome
I'm going to announce the answer
According to Descartes
If "I think" is a completely immaterial being
But human beings are completely physical beings
So how does our cogito and soul control our bodies?
How can a non-physical thing control matter
For example, now my brain
My cogito orders me to go left
Then look at me and go left
But my body is completely flesh
that immaterial soul
How does the immaterial cogito control this physical body
But this is immaterial
He should not have any causal relationship with the material world
This objection was unexpected to Descartes at first.
After Descartes published his theory in a book
A princess of the Holy Roman Empire raised this question
She said: Descartes according to you
Then if I think is an existence that does not occupy the physical space at all
how he affects the human body
how he controls our bodies
Look at my cogito tell me to go forward and I will go forward
But my brain and my body are completely physical
who is in control
How did this interaction occur?
Then Descartes was frightened
Because it's something he never thought about
So he ran off to the Holy Roman Empire
meet the princess
Chatting all night as if I found a confidant
And their conversations have now been collected and published as a book
That's an important thing to say.
That's when we usually talk about philosophy
We all start from this when we talk about Western philosophy
Then you think of Descartes
But what about this woman, her rebuttal to Descartes
never included in the history of philosophy
But she may be the first female philosopher in the modern history of human history
So why have female voices disappeared?
Because in the 16th and 17th centuries
in that era
basically women have no right to publish
Publishing a book has nothing to do with women
again
At that time the church system and the university system
The university system at that time was basically a church system
At that time, there was no such thing as a university philosophy department.
University Philosophy is something that only existed after the 18th century
Then you want to see how Descartes studied philosophy in that era?
Philosophy
He didn't go to the philosophy department of the university to study philosophy
Because there were no university philosophy departments
Only boys can enter
But the problem is that the church system is only for boys to enter.
what about the princess
If there were women who were very intelligent, very philosophical
what if you want to have a debate
She doesn't really have any way to argue with men
So these aristocratic European aristocratic families
If there are very intelligent women
They run underground organizations in private
Hold a salon
and invite the smartest women they know to come
Then work together to crack the loopholes in Cartesian philosophy
then talk talk talk talk
communicate their chat process to Descartes
Then Descartes found out that wow
A secret organization in faraway Germany has cracked my philosophy
So Descartes went to the Holy Roman Empire to find these princesses
What about the culture of this salon?
It has been very popular in Europe since the 17th century
all the way to france
As in France you can also see the hosts of all the salons
usually hostess
because they just can't
Those who publish books on this platform
But they also have a desire for philosophical debate
So they privately hold salons
and then debate philosophy with the other guests
So the French philosophers Rousseau, Voltaire, Diderot
These philosophers after their books were published
The hostesses of these female salons debate their philosophies in private
and catch their holes
It turned out that what they debated was even more exciting than the original philosophers
So people like Rousseau, Voltaire, Diderot
Just run to those hostess salons
Then I heard that these women are like this
It turns out that these women look at my philosophy system like this
and scrape their ideas into their philosophical systems
and then publish it again
So when you look at any content on the history of philosophy
All you see and hear are male voices
But other men
Secretly hide women's criticism in his own philosophy
well this is the origin of philosophy
The origin of philosophy is
Men claim to be doing philosophical thinking
But the reason why the edifice of his philosophical thinking can be complete
In fact, it is because he secretly added a lot of female criticism into it
sometimes the other way
is a criticism that directly suppresses women
So here we suddenly start from philosophical thinking
suddenly switch to a very sociological thinking
is the origin of philosophical thinking
Descartes, for example, was not all skeptical in the end
In the end, even the real world is fake
Then this way of thinking, he thinks he doubts a lot
But in the end, he did not suspect how the human cogito interacts with the body
Then the German princess doubted his system even more thoroughly than Descartes
Then say no why didn't you ask the question
So if you look at it by Cartesian standards
This princess is actually more Cartesian than Cartesian
Because she doubted more thoroughly
So if you go to their newsletter
you will find it amazing
That is, her rational thinking ability is actually higher than that of Descartes.
But she will never be written into the history of philosophy
because the history of philosophy we read
Whether it is a Taiwanese who reads the history of philosophy
or the history of philosophy that Europeans read
In fact, they have been screened to a certain extent.
So when we read this philosophy
Just pay attention to one thing
we are in one of the thinking systems
Also excludes another thinking system
How do I get this thing back?
We have to do another kind of thinking called historical thinking
This is when I arrived in Italy
Visiting a friend's house in Trieste
Then I went to visit the castle that has been preserved from the 18th century to the present
Then this is 200 years ago
That female salon owner will run a salon in their own study
keep exactly the same
It looked like this 200 years ago
But he has a seal
His room is sealed
you can't go in
So I can only take pictures outside
good
So only philosophical thinking is not enough
Then we have to move on to another kind of historical thinking
What is Historic Thinking?
is that we have to think about this
When we study any philosophy or western theory
we have to think about something
Under what historical circumstances was it created?
For example, the philosophy of Descartes we just talked about
In fact, there is another big loophole
Do you want to guess
Because I said just now that I think, therefore I am here
He is based on not being able to doubt what he used to doubt
Otherwise, you will be caught in a cycle of doubt
So how is he going to make sure that this cannot be doubted?
There is only one thing that cannot be doubted
the act of doubt itself
rather than suspicious content
Doubt is doubtful
For example, am I dreaming now?
it may be
so you're all fake
but one thing is true
That is, "I'm suspecting that you are fake" is true
what is that like
It is thought to maintain this doubt
What kind of thinking to sustain this doubt
This sentence is a bit mysterious
Could you please clarify what exactly you mean?
It's because he said I think therefore I am
Then thought is an immaterial
something indescribable
how do you prove that he represents you
how to prove he represents you
okay
Your first speech went something like this
because you just said that you
Do you think there is another source for that "cogito"
do you mean this
It is a source that supports the existence of this cogito
For example, if I am now a vegetable
My brain can't move
I can't move my brain
Then I can't think and act rationally.
So you think that brain is the real thing
Cogito is the consequence of brain movement
If it's a vegetable, he's brain dead
no thinking activity
do you mean this
but you don't mean that
It should be said that I don't quite know how to describe his existence.
That is, you think there is a more fundamental existence than the Cogito
That's the thing that precedes me, isn't it?
So if there is no such thing there is no cogito
the highest faculties of reason
good
What about this speech?
In fact, in the 20th century
There is a school of feminists who say
What Feminists Think of Descartes' Philosophy
think about it
if you were descartes' mother
Then you worked so hard to conceive and give birth to Descartes in October
And Descartes now has some philosophical training
Then he ran back and said to his mother:
Mom I think you're just a dream
you are fake
only cogito is true
what would you think if you were the fuck
You take this kid...
strangle him?
So there is a problem here
so feminists say no right now
Descartes' cogito does not exist independently
The prerequisite for you to be able to do the activity of cogito first is
You have to be born by another person first
so any i'm action
The premise must be related to the existence of another person
Somebody has to give birth to you first
you live in this world
only you can think
Without this, there is no need to talk about it later
mother without cartesian
Descartes would not publish and talk about these things here
This should be very easy to understand
So feminists offer a critique
that is
When these male philosophers are thinking =
They completely ignore the physical relationship
In fact, there is a very intimate relationship between the human body and the human body.
When Descartes came up with that philosophy
Actually what happened at the same time?
Europeans discover America
then they found out
There is actually a group of human-like things in the local area
Native American
But the first thing they found these Native Americans
what are they confused about
How do we know if they are human?
they might be animals
just look like a human
Everyone has seen Arrival
when the alien came
How did they know that was an alien?
Or do they actually have some intelligence to communicate
Just to communicate with him on linguistics.
In language communication, it is necessary to find that they can understand
That "understanding" is a certain degree of rational ability
ok so here it is
When Europeans saw these natives
The first thing they think about is how do we know if they are human
this question is important
because if they're not human
It's okay if we kill them all
if they were like rocks
It doesn't matter if I emptied all the gold and silver.
because they are not human
So there was one in Spain
The First Philosophical Debate in European History
It's called the Valladollid debate
It's two missionaries arguing
Are those indigenous peoples we encounter in the non-Western world human?
please pay attention
When I say non-Western world natives
it includes the aborigines of taiwan
This time is also the same point in time when the Dutch met the Siraya people of Taiwan
how is this debate going
This debate was initiated by a missionary in Mexico
called Las Casas
Then he debated with another Sepúlveda who was a guardian of European traditions
Then the Sepúlveda, guardian of European traditions, said
You see when we got to America
we saw the aborigines
This is the Aztec Empire
The thing that scares them the most is two things
One is that they have this tradition of offering sacrifices
sacrifice the living
And they have a tradition of cannibalism
They may eat their family or eat rivals
And then there's something even more terrifying
They don't even have a government to maintain social order
All Native Americans were in an anarchic society
At this time Sepúlveda said:
According to the philosophy of Aristotle
If there is no government in a society
represents what
These people don't know how to rule themselves
then if you don't know how to rule yourself
your state of mind
Actually like a child
Children are bumping everywhere
They don't know how to take care of themselves
At this time, an adult needs to take care of him.
Who is this grown man?
Who is the most powerful person?
these are the europeans
So Aristotle's philosophy is used in this process of rationalizing colonization
And how does this Las Casas respond?
He is the local Mexican missionary
He got along with the local aborigines
he said he said he said
no you made a mistake
the local aborigines
Why they don't have a government system
Not because they are less civilized
just the opposite
Because they don't need a government system
maintain social order
And their social order is their culture
So their culture is their law
But if you think about when we were talking about Descartes
So-called man-made cultural laws are all unreliable
So their logic is completely opposite
People prove to use their culture to support their legal system
And they don't need a government to impose their legal system on the people
The people will take care of themselves
But for philosophers like Descartes, the opposite is true.
no
We need a government to maintain this social order
to maintain the operation of the law
if not
if only the law was there
Will you be obedient?
If there is no government, no police to control you
to make a final guarantee
Will you be obedient?
Europeans don't
So it's hard for Europeans to imagine this
How is it possible that you don't have a government because you are more self-disciplined
Next Las Casas went on to say
You said those weird cannibalism and human sacrifices
seems to be them
An evidence of a relatively low level of civilization
but what is it actually
think about it
These Native Americans
They don't have any weapons
Then suddenly a group of foreigners came
into their society
the first thing they do
When they met the Columbus group
The first thing they do is open the door
and then welcome these outsiders into their society
Then these people start asking about their natural resources
Where are your gold and silver mines, where are your mines
Then the aborigines took them there very naively.
In the end all the gold and silver mines were looted and emptied
So if there are those kings who defy the behavior of Europeans
The kings of the Inca Empire were killed
Aboriginal people have never experienced such a thing
I am so kind to welcome a group of foreigners to my country
Then it turned out that these people, for unknown reasons,
drain all the resources of our country
and kill my king
Now there are strange philosophical reasons
Said we will take care of ourselves
It's them who want to control us
So when the aborigines suddenly found that they couldn't explain this matter at all
they think it's okay
Maybe we did something wrong to make God angry
We must sacrifice a few people to appease the wrath of the gods
Turns out when they were making these sacrifices
Europeans say look
So this is not a civilized country
So this needs us Europeans to manage you
So this sacrificial ceremony
Instead, it became a piece of evidence that allowed Europeans to colonize these aborigines
more importantly
When the colonial officials passed, the missionaries passed at the same time
Missionaries want to expand this Christian territory
map of catholic christianity
What did the missionaries of the Catholic Church say at the time?
They told the aborigines
How do you believe in this ritual of human sacrifice?
You have to see if the religion you believe in may be a cult
Maybe an evil spirit is deceiving you
His statement is exactly the same as that of Descartes
Do you guys still remember
We say that Descartes' philosophy is
You have to imagine that an evil spirit has been deceiving you
And now when this European goes to America
just tell those people
How do you believe in this strange religion?
You were deceived by this evil spirit
What you don't believe may be a cult
And eventually he'll say
You have to believe in this orthodox religion
what is this orthodox religion
their catholic christianity
so finally
Native Americans to Europeans
That is, on the one hand, they are preaching the gospel
But on the other hand, it is burning, killing and looting
This incident led them to a conclusion
They say the bible was written by the devil
That's what they told the colonial official
We don't want your bible because your bible is written by the devil
So you were sent by the devil
Now I will talk about a recent anthropological study
very interesting
many aboriginal societies
They both deliberately maintain an egalitarian mode of existence
They have no government, officials
Because they think if you create a system of government
Then there will be some people who are more powerful
others must obey them
But this is actually the origin of the origin of the modern state
Modern countries, all civilized countries, those countries that can enter the United Nations
They all look like this
On the contrary, you can't get into the United Nations.
Those aborigine societies without the concept of a country
Instead, they live in an egalitarian society.
Then anthropologists study what's going on
They are adamant against adopting the nation-state system
Then anthropologists started to study the matter
As a result, many aboriginal societies were discovered.
their egalitarian culture
Most likely why?
If you look at the distribution of the entire geography
you will find
These egalitarian tribal cultures
They are all scattered around the great empires of human history
So if you go to see the ancient Sumerian civilization of Sumeria
There are many aboriginal tribes in the mountains and forests near it
They are all egalitarian
If you go to the Andes Mountains in South America, there is the Inca Empire
It's next to it in the Amazon rainforest
there are many egalitarian Native Americans
Same in Taiwan
after the dutch came
Many aborigines couldn't stand it, they fled to the deep mountains
When the same Japanese came to colonize Taiwan
The aborigines couldn't bear it and fled to the deep mountains
The most famous one is the Seediq
This is the story of "Sedek Bale"
This leads anthropologists to make an inference
the aborigines we thought
They seem to live in a primitive society
Actually the opposite is true
They have actually surpassed the level of the nation-state
They have discovered that the nation-state is a threat
because it will most likely become an empire
rule over his people
so they are fleeing the nation state
So the way they escape is
we'll leave the empire and flee to its frontiers
to create a society of one's own
But after they did this
For example, in America
Central America had the Aztec Empire
You can see a lot of egalitarian tribes scattered around the Aztec Empire
It is very likely that they were all once in the empire.
escaped slave
And then they themselves build the society they want
It is an equal coexistence between one person and another.
And strangers are also very welcome
As long as we need help, we will help his kind of society
then they succeeded
but they succeeded less than a few hundred years later
Europeans are coming
Then see ah this is a stranger we want to welcome them
Because we are egalitarian people
It turned out that the people brought in were a group of people who wanted to rebuild an empire locally
this matter
in the 19th century
Discovered by American anthropologists
It is the aborigines insisting on egalitarianism
Pay more attention to the relationship between people
At the same time, they also reject many modern European systems
For example, the monetary system, the government state system, and the private property system
All of these were rejected by them
This happened in the 19th century
Discovered by American anthropologist Morgan
When this anthropologist found out, he published a book
Later, it was seen by a European philosopher named Marx
Marx said
what i've been thinking about
The most ideal human society
also communism
It has already been realized by these aborigines
He called this primitive communism
the original communist society
while he thinks
In fact, humans have been
are living in that state
And this incident actually gave Marx an empirical proof
that communism is not a fantasy
because it has long been achieved by many Aboriginal societies
The question is just how do we modernize
already living in modern society.
In a world that already uses money and already has governments
Recreate another communist society close to our origin
This is what Marx was thinking about
Let's do another historical thinking
Descartes' thinking actually has another big loophole
that's what he said
How are we going to prove you're human?
it's easy
You have to be able to show that cogito
That cogito is your ability to doubt
Then let me ask you, if your family has dogs and cats?
Have you ever seen your dog or cat display that ability to doubt?
Have you ever seen your dog or cat just come and bite you? Are you sure you are a real human?
are you the real master
Does anyone have a dog or cat in their household with this capacity for rational skepticism?
Probably not
for Descartes
if not
means you are not human
You are not entitled to the same legal status as humans
for Descartes
Cats and dogs have their legal status like stones
because they have only physical existence
He does not have any cogito, this rational faculty
He is below the rank of human
So humans can use these animals for biological science experiments
So why did the Europeans develop the natural sciences
Allowing animals to be used for science experiments
Because they are based on the philosophy of Descartes
But why did Descartes believe that there is an order in the existence of all things in this world?
Because Europe has an older cultural tradition
great chain of being
Great chain of being
This great chain of beings is like this
There is an order in the existence of all things in the world
The topmost is called God
called angel again
call it human again
call it an animal again
call it a plant
finally called minerals
There is actually a logic to this sequence
The higher the class
His material level is less
The more spiritual
So God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-good
but god has no body at all
His physical level is 0
Then the lower you go, there are angels and then there are humans.
Do human beings have a physical body, but at the same time they also have the cogito
This cogito is like a part of God's ability
stuffed into the human brain
So we each share a little bit of God's power
And then down to the animals, there's only matter left
don't have the ability to reason
and then down to the minerals
Minerals are perfect substances.
Unlike animals at least move
the great chain of being
In the society of ancient Greece, there was a traditional belief of this culture
And then practiced all the way to this medieval church
In the age inherited to Descartes
so do you remember
We say that Descartes said to doubt all the cultural traditions set by human beings
are unreliable
But Descartes did not doubt his own cultural tradition
this great chain of being
A tradition that has prevailed in Europe for over 2,000 years
Until now our natural scientists
The reason why they experimented with white mice
Also use this system of belief
I'll talk about one first
What would a society without belief in this system look like?
anthropological thinking
Europeans now have a system of science or philosophy
basically based on Cartesian philosophy
Cartesian philosophy is basically based on the fact that human beings have reason and the ability to doubt
So he is different from everything else in the world
He can enjoy more rights because he is closer to God
God is the all-knowing, all-powerful, all-good, rational being
Now let me talk about a completely different way of thinking
When Europeans are building on their philosophy
At the same time, the aborigines were actually thinking about the Europeans
what are they thinking
Let's look at this picture
This picture is when the Spaniards attacked Central and South America
they sometimes lose
Spain was taken back as a prisoner of war
how did they treat those prisoners of war
You can look at these aborigines who are doing something to prisoners of war
Just soak their bodies in the river
because they test it this way
is he human
what does it mean
What did Europeans do when they tested whether Aboriginal people were human?
we have a debate
Let's see if these aborigines are rational
as rational as we are
But when the aborigines tested whether the Europeans were human
what they do is soak them in the river
because they want to test
Does he share the same body as me?
Because for these aborigines
They believe in animism
All beings in the world have the same spiritual power and rational ability
There is no doubt about this matter
So aboriginals don't go to debate saying
Does this European have the same capacity for reason as I do?
they don't need to debate
because they believe in animism
this matter is settled
how do i prove
Are you the same person as me?
it's easy
I'll soak your body in water
After your body is submerged in water
if you will drown
means you share the same body system as me
But if I soak you in the water
you swim away
Then you share the same body system as the fish
You are different from me
so you are not human
Then you find two completely different modes of thinking
their way of thinking is
The existence of all things in the world is the same degree of rationality
same spiritual power
The difference is that we have different body systems
For them it is the body that distinguishes, not the reason
while in europe
All beings share the same body system
We are made of atoms
but one thing is different
It means that human beings have more rationality
your dog doesn't
Although you and your dog share the same atom
You all share the same kind of atoms, right?
but you have reason and he doesn't
So people are special
You can see that both of them don't understand the thinking mode at all
why are you talking about this
because about 20 years ago
There was an anthropologist named Descola
He went to the Amazon rainforest in South America to do field work
Do fieldwork with the local Achuar people
Then he discovered what the local animistic system looked like
For example, the local Achuar people, their women are planting plants
Then when you plant a plant, you see that plant
you water it and it grows
Slowly grow up and then bloom and bear fruit
I don't know if you have any experience in growing potted plants
If anyone has this potted plant
you'll know how they feel
It's like you're looking after a child
watching this kid grow up
So for these parents
Inside the society of the Achuar
those plants
They share the same appellation with their children
they are their children
Then they can enter into their kinship
same
Their society has a gender division of labor
Girls are responsible for planting and boys are responsible for hunting
When the boy went hunting
will take the hounds
You saw your hound go hunting with your other brothers
what does this seem to mean
That brother of yours fought alongside your hound
Actually, that Hound is your brother.
so they will use the same kinship title
Kindred titles like brothers to refer to their hounds
So they basically take the existence of everything
Regardless of whether it is animals or plants
Treat them like family
So this Descola found
A woman in the tribe went into the mountain and was bitten by a snake
what was their first reaction
It must have been when we went to the forest yesterday
Accidentally put the gods in this mountain to make it uncomfortable
If it is this mountain forest, send a snake to bite the woman of our tribe
Their way of thinking is the exact opposite of Descartes'
Just imagine if it was a scientifically rational colonial official in the 16th century
come to this tribe
Then the people in this tribe told him like this
what will he say
How do you believe in this cult
you have to doubt you have to use your rational force to doubt
The tribe gives you a cultural system that is imposed on you
and you'll find out later
none of these things are reliable
but one thing is sure
human reason
But if according to the philosophy of Descartes
They don't treat their animals and plants like this
They will use their animals and plants to do natural science experiments
Then they will develop their own land
Because they think those lands don't have any gods either
Then in the end it will become a society like Europe
All resource resources have been exploited
so why talk about this
Because he is not far away from us now
I just said that this is all philosophy from four or five hundred years ago.
Then this is a more recent study
But it is actually closely related to our current living situation.
For example, the tribe he did was called the Achuar people
He was at this global climate summit two years ago
attend directly
Two years ago in Glasgow
This aborigine is a believer
animistic aborigines
The aborigines who believe that there are gods in the mountains
He's the leader of the local Amazon
Just go to the climate summit in Glasgow and tell Westerners
You are hurting our gods
The way you look at nature is totally wrong
How did this way of looking at nature come about?
It comes from the philosophy of Cartesian rationalism 500 years ago
we need to think about it
That is when we are absorbing Western theories
In fact, we are also copying these Europeans in the past at the same time
the damage they did to the earth
So we can't just passively accept these western theories
we actually have to think
When these western theories spread to the whole world
When science spreads to the world
What impact does it have on the local society and the environment?
just put it another way
The question of why we face a global climate crisis today
It actually originated 500 years ago
The Europeans used Descartes' system
If it wasn't Europeans who colonized the world 500 years ago
but the words of these native South Americans
We wouldn't have a climate crisis problem today
We would be living in a completely different cultural system
This is very anthropological thinking
Let's talk about one last
what i learned after i went to europe
associative thinking
What is connected thinking?
Now European and American academia
There is a tendency in the social sciences
That is, we don't put any social culture or history
as a vacuum, insulating existence
when i was giving a speech
Aren't they all talking about Western things?
philosophy of the west or native south americans
These seem far away to us
it's all western
But the current trend in the social sciences
just to tell you
There is no real West or non-West
All Western or non-Western
In fact, it all comes from the interaction with the other side.
so
For example, when I was talking about Cartesian philosophy
you guys need to know one thing
Although Descartes was French
but he is not writing philosophy in french
Because the censorship mechanism of the Catholic Church in Europe was very strong at that time
Descartes' rationality needs to doubt one's own traditional culture
would threaten the Catholic Church
so he can't publish the book in france
He had to move to Amsterdam, where publishing was most open at the time, to write the book
At that time Amsterdam was the Netherlands
It happens to be the country that colonized Asia
When Indonesia and Taiwan
what are they doing in these countries
They used Taiwan's deerskin and natural resources
Take it to trade with the Japanese, take it to Batavia, and ship some back to Holland
when descartes was writing in holland
The things he uses are Made In Taiwan
Here we can do a connected thinking
on the one hand in Europe
Descartes is using something made in Taiwan
what about in taiwan
After the Dutch came to Taiwan
They found a big obstacle
First the first Aboriginal leader without politics
because i just said
Indigenous people live in an egalitarian society
They don't need political leaders
The aborigines have a strong sense of land ownership
It's that they don't want the Europeans to get their land
The third big problem is that the aborigines did not have a writing system at that time
A society without a writing system
a big problem for europeans
Because you basically don't have a writing system
you can't sign any contract
Then you can't record any taxes either
so what to do
The Dutch began to build schools in Taiwan
and then teach these aborigines
You have to doubt the god you are worshiping
What kind of god did Taiwanese people worship at that time?
Taiwan's aborigines worship
They filled the jug with that water and worshiped the jug
They worship the god in the water
will live in that water
Then the missionaries at that time used the Descartes method to tell the aborigines in Taiwan
You have to doubt your belief system
may be a cult
How do you think there is a god in that water?
this is called superstition
We have to believe in the true God
It is the one with the highest level of rationality who is full-time and all-around
The god with the highest chain of existence
Then they taught the aboriginal Siraya people in Taiwan at that time
Various European languages ​​Latin
After learning the language
These Dutchmen are about to start making indentures with the natives.
how did they buy it
they said
I'm going to buy you land with 100 meters of rope now
what would you think
Is it 100 inches of land, right?
But the Dutch actually mean
100 times 100
This is actually 100 times the original number
The aborigines thought it was such a piece
But he's actually 100 times 100
so he will turn 100 times
Because the length x width is 100x100
So it becomes 10,000 inches of land
The way the Dutch use it is the way they play with words
Deceived the land of many Taiwanese aborigines
Then you still remember the philosophy of Descartes
there is a thing called
You have to visualize everything you do in life
There is an evil spirit lying to you
Who is this evil spirit?
These are the Europeans
It is the era and environment in which Descartes lived
These European colonial regimes are everywhere defrauding indigenous peoples all over the world
So you can see why Descartes came up with such a philosophy
It's actually with us
He was thinking about that evil spirit that deceived people everywhere.
It is the evil spirit that came to our country to deceive our aborigines
another thing is
This is Cartesian scientific thinking
Disassemble a living person into that assembly
Assemble a watch and disassemble it into small parts
Understand the small part first
you can understand the big part
Natural science teachers in Taiwan learn this set of Western science systems
When they went to Lanyu to teach, they discovered that
The children in Lanyu can't understand this set
This set of science is too strange for them
how do you think there are living people
or living animals and plants that can be taken apart
Take it apart like a clock
Then understand the parts and put them back together
just understand a clock
it's so weird for them
So they don't learn from the start
until those high school teachers found out
In fact, I want to teach these Lanyu children
The best way is to take them outdoors
just show them some flora and fauna
Then tell him what this is what this is
Because it's like he's touching a real person
Because to them it's animism
that is the living person
It's like you're making a friend
You're not meeting a lifeless picture in a textbook
you are meeting a living person
dealing with a living person
So these things are actually in Taiwan
happening at the same time
It didn't just happen in Descartes' world 500 years ago
Now in our society in Taiwan
this happened at the same time
So this is connected thinking
So when we talk about any western theory
you can think of one thing right away
Is this what happened in my country?
or what does this matter have to do with my country
What does it have to do with our society
On the contrary when we think about our society
any issues in Taiwan
you can do associative thinking
How would Westerners think about this matter?
Finally let's talk
This is the psychoanalytic thinking I learned in Europe
I just said that Descartes' system has several loopholes
There is another biggest loophole here
Descartes said how do you know
Isn't what I'm seeing in real life now a dream?
maybe it's just a dream
that's fake
But if it's false, then what I want to pursue is the truth
We are philosophers seeking truth
so we can't believe this stuff
Impossible to believe in such things as dreams
Now psychoanalysis has to say
How can you say that the dream must be fake?
Maybe what's in the dream is real
Things in dreams are closer to the truth
What does that mean
Psychoanalytic thinking goes like this:
If I say, do you love your mother?
how would you answer me
You actually only have two answers
you can only say i love my mom
Another answer is that I don't love my mother
but in fact
Psychoanalytic research found
Relationship of all individual owners to parents
Emotional relationships must be love-hate
There's a love part and a hate part
but now the problem
when i ask do you love your mother
you can only answer me
if you say i love
The emotion that I hate my mother is suppressed
If you say I hate my mother
Then the emotion that I love my mother has been suppressed again.
So no matter what, there will be depression in my heart
What is the root of this problem
The root of the problem is that humans only have one mouth
If man were a creature with two mouths there would be no psychoanalysis
because people don't have depression
If a person has two mouths I can answer you at the same time
I love my mother's mouth
Another mouth says I hate my mother
that problem is solved
But the fact is that people don't have two mouths
people have only one mouth
So the other voice will be suppressed
Now psychoanalysis like Freud would say
when will that pent up voice come out
It happens when you accidentally say the wrong thing
So if you're a Cartesian rationalist philosopher
You'd think you'd say the wrong thing if you said the wrong thing
just let him go
you don't think too much
But now psychoanalytic thinking
Like Freud would say: no
It is when the truth is revealed that the words are spoken
So let's look at an example from Freud
He said 4 people were involved in all the sex acts
you had sex with someone
Suddenly, halfway through
He accidentally called the wrong name
He called his ex-boyfriend, ex-girlfriend's name
what does this mean
This is what in all sex
In fact, you are regarded by him as a substitute for another person.
all love relationships
Freud would be very aggressive
He will think that all love relationships are really substitute relationships
But the substitute doesn't have to be an ex-boyfriend or an ex-girlfriend.
it has the potential to be a very desirable prototype
For example, I have a unique prince charming and princess in my heart who wants to look like this
and then in real life to find
and found you
But in fact, what I love is not you, what I love is that prototype
But you're someone very close to that prototype.
when we have sex
I don't want to call it the prototype by mistake.
We'll think it's the wrong name
this is a slip of the tongue
But Freud said: No, this is when the truth emerges
Speak your unconscious truth
you love that archetype
not the person in the real world
Let's watch a movie first to talk about this
this movie is called girlfriend boyfriend
Directed by Yang Yazhe
Have you read this story?
The story is that it's a love triangle.
This guy loves this guy
Then this male second loves this female
But this woman loves this man
so it's a love triangle
Finally these two are together
This man and woman are together
Then the guy is gay
He's with another guy
But when he makes love to another boy
He's thinking about this boy
And when the two of them make love
This girl thinks about this guy
Let's take a look at this snippet
You can understand what Freud said
What does every sex act involve 4 people
did you see
It deliberately arranges two sex scenes to happen at the same time
But at the same time it has a metaphor that
When these two bed scenes happened
They're actually thinking about the person on the other side of the other side.
So this is having sex with four people at the same time
but when will this truth be revealed
when you call the wrong name
Let us now take an example of a dream
my own example
One of the main reasons I went to Europe
That is, there is a strong tradition of psychoanalysis in the area.
Asian societies basically do not have this tradition
Only two countries in Asia have psychoanalysis
One is called India and the other is called Japan
Taiwan does not
Taiwan is struggling to develop
So one of my goals in the future is to learn these things back.
and bring it back to Taiwan
Then I will now talk about an example that I was analyzed
I had a very strange dream
this dream is like this
I'm in a dream
inside a building
Then I suddenly found that next to this window
It can be seen that there is a group of dogs on the first floor
Then I wanted to go to the first floor and play with the dogs
so i rushed out
Then you see a spiral staircase
This spiral staircase leads to an elevator
so i'm going to find the elevator
but i found out
It turns out that the spiral staircase cannot reach the elevator.
There is a hole between it and the elevator
so i can't get to that elevator
And then I thought about how I'm going to get out of this building
so i run up
when running up
I suddenly met
Taiwanese friends I once met in Paris
Because I went to Paris last month
I just saw these two Taiwanese friends
then ask them
how do i escape from this building
Then all of a sudden I saw the Palace of Versailles across from this building
Then I said I want to fly to the Palace of Versailles, is it possible?
Then these two friends told me that it's impossible
But then I really want to fly there
Suddenly the screen shifts to a secret room
I'm locked in a secret room
Then there is a computer inside
What is playing on this computer?
is a pyramid-like mound of earth
But I looked closer and realized it wasn't a mound
He's actually stuck in a shit pile all by himself
Then suddenly a man walked in and said to me
say in a threatening sentence
This is what you end up with if you go to Versailles
I can't explain this dream so tell my analyst
what did my analyst say
He said you want to go to that elevator
but you can't go
there is a place you want to go
but you never reach
where is that
she asked me
then i said
Where I want to go soon...
I am applying for Ph.D.
Then I also applied and sent it, but I haven't waited for the result yet.
so there's a place i want to go
But I haven't waited for that result yet
Because I applied for doctoral programs in the United States and the United Kingdom
And then I'm not sure which side I want to go
My mind tells me I should go to America
Because the United States has more resources
Then my analyst asked me
But you still have Versailles in your dreams
Didn't you go to Paris a while ago?
have you been to the palace of versailles
I just said no
because I arranged
last day to firsey palace
but i found out later
The Palace of Versailles is not in Paris
its on the outskirts of paris
So you're going to Versailles and you're going to take an hour's drive there
Then take another hour's drive back
gone in two hours
I'm afraid the last day will be too late
wanted to go but didn't
Then my analyst said
So there's a place you want to go but can't
then i said yes
Isn't that why I'm applying for the Ph.D. class of that Ph.D.
But I'm not yet sure if I'll go to that place
She said, which side do you prefer to go to?
Then I said I should prefer to go to which side of the United States
Because more money, more scholarships
Then I said, but I went to America last year
I have a very bad impression of America
because I was in Pittsburgh for a seminar
then in pittsburgh
i live right next to the andy war and the museum
It's a very downtown place
One night at 9:10 p.m.
I want to go out to buy supper
But Pittsburgh gives me the feeling that
It's not safe even in the city center
Law and order is very bad
So that night I wanted to say okay
It's better not to go out to buy supper
i will stay at home
Then wake up the next morning
i see
Right next to that Andy Warhol Museum
3 dead in a shooting
So if I go out that night
I can't speak to you here right now
I could have been shot in a shooting
So I have always had a bad impression of America.
Compared with the degree of racial discrimination, the United States may be worse and more serious than Europe
So I have always had this very bad impression of America
so i just say
I don't know if I can go to America or not
Then my analyst suddenly said:
yeah cuz you go you might end up stuck in that shit
Then suddenly it occurred to me, yeah
Because when I was chatting with my European friends
My European friends would tell me America is a shit place
America is a shitty place
So America equals shit
It's from my friend
My friend's words entered my unconscious
Then when my unconscious is dreaming
Made by the words of my friend
not made by my own language
This is psychoanalytic thinking
so you see my reason
I always thought I wanted to go to America
Because there are more scholarships there
But my dream is actually telling me the opposite
My dreams are telling me I'm not right
America is a shit place
if i go
I end up stuck in that shit pile
Stuck in that rock pile like the man in the dream
So my unconscious is telling me the exact opposite
Imagine if you were Descartes
you'd think it was a dream
ignore it
You pay for psychoanalysis you're crazy
If you were a Cartesian philosopher you would think like this
But Freud now speaks of the exact opposite
wrong
The truth just happens to be in the dream you thought was false
Finally, I will return to my experience in making films in the past few years
It’s just making films. We’ve always introduced western theories.
While introducing Western theories
I've been worrying about one thing
It is to bring in these western ideas
In fact, it is very likely that Taiwan will go back to the wrong path that Europe has taken before.
For example, the Cartesian subject I just talked about is like this
Then if Taiwanese scientists adopt a Cartesian-style subject
Rather than an animist subject like Lanyu
That's a lot worse
So what exactly is our approach to the natural world?
Which one are we going to use
It's the Western set
Or the aborigines of Taiwan
It will bring Taiwan to a different place
So at the end of World War II
When many nation-states in the third world around the world became independent
They are actually thinking a lot
What we are going to adopt now is the Western one.
but let's not do that
Is it possible for us to come up with our own way
So the philosophers in France
A philosopher who grew up in Africa but trained medically in France called Fanon
He warned the Africans
You must be careful about your desire to build another Europe in Africa
Then you can think about Taiwan today
In fact, we also want to build another Europe in Taiwan
Another America
That's why the so-called 2030 bilingual country policy appears
What about academia?
Actually you can also see
If you are studying in the United States
would be the first to be able to find a faculty position in this academia
I just said a lot of things
You may feel that it is Western philosophy, Western theory
Or in the world of the aborigines far away from us
But I'm going to say these things now as a tool for thinking
We can turn our heads around and think about our own society
for example what
I'm asking you now what do you think is very Taiwanese
What can be called Taiwanese culture and Taiwanese characteristics?
Dirty words in Hokkien
That's from China
That's not something from Taiwan
If you colonize like you just did
We use aphasia as an essence to explore Taiwan's culture
Because we were originally in a colonial society background
Then we make the foundation of our culture with the background of colonization
And then back to what we may have been the essence of the original island nation
Let's talk about speaking our own language
Could it be a more in line with our national characteristics?
Or it is a representation of the comparative ego
Well, this answer is a bit complicated.
what you want to say is
Taiwan was colonized due to
So suffer from Taiwanese aphasia
In the case of Taiwanese aphasia
If we want to get rid of it, we want to find a way to get back our own language
this thing with a language of its own
It's actually kind of implying one thing
That is, at present, Taiwan does not have its own exclusive culture.
My personal opinion is this
Taiwan has yet to develop a systematic culture of its own
why
because you need to know
to grow a culture
Actually it will take a long time
At least one or two hundred years of history
In order to grow a culture with its own unique characteristics like Europe and the United States
But the set of problems faced by the Taiwanese is this
We don't actually have enough time
develop their own culture like European and American countries
because when we get rid of a colonist
Another Colonist Arrives
But this creates a very strange phenomenon
Then I think that the peculiar phenomenon is unique to Taiwan
That is, if you regard the history of Taiwan as a stratum
The bottom is the Dutch, the Spaniards are here
Then the upper layer of Chinese came
Then the Japanese on the upper level came
And at the bottom you could say Aboriginal culture
So this so mixed culture all mixed together
in a society on an island
It actually creates a hybrid culture
This hybrid culture is not multicultural
different from plural
i live in london
London is a very cosmopolitan and diverse city
But "diversified" is not the same as "mixed"
why
For example in London
You have many options to choose from
You can go to Indian restaurant, Japanese cuisine, British cuisine, Italian cuisine
But you go into that restaurant
You can only eat that dish
You won't be eating other dishes
but in taiwan
night markets in Taiwan
You can buy an oyster omelet with your left hand
Right hand to buy a pasta
Then go buy an English black tea on the other side
Then it is completely mixed
then you can have everything for dinner
This is actually a very strange thing in the eyes of Westerners.
For example, Taiwanese put chicken testicles on top of pizza
This is something Italians have absolutely no way of accepting
a total disgrace
But why Taiwanese don't care at all
I don't think this is a problem at all
because it's simple
We haven't developed a very strong egos, exclusivity culture
We don't ask and say: no, it's not in our culture
Then such a reaction, in fact, we have not grown a culture of our own
So we think that whatever you mix is ​​acceptable
This mixed culture actually appears in many places
For example, Taiwanese like to sing karaoke
Is Karaoke a Taiwanese Culture?
It's not karaoke, it's from Japan
Also influenced by Japanese culture
For example, when I'm chatting with Europeans
they just say
You treat me like your boyfriend, so what are we going to do?
Then I said if you are my Taiwanese friend
we will go to karaoke tonight
They just say you Taiwanese are singing karaoke?
Then I said yes
He said in Europe, European and American countries
Karaoke is a relatively low culture
I just said: what are you talking about! ?
So how do you satisfy your desire to sing?
They say if you want to sing
Best case is to have someone who can play the guitar
a party occasion
and then the guy will play the guitar
and then the others sang along
Then you can satisfy their desire to sing
is that they have a
"When it comes to satisfying my desires, what is better" imagine
When Taiwan satisfies any desire
His imagination
They have already been controlled by foreign cultures and foreign colonists.
Already positioned in the pulse of history
So we don't really think about it
I didn't find out until after I went abroad, for example.
Actually, this thing is quite strange
one last thing
I think it's a very Taiwanese thing
Taiwan's economic GDP is completely controlled by the technology industry
The technology industry accounts for a very large proportion of this matter
The words that led to the children in Taiwan wanting to become the victorious group in life
He has to study science and engineering to be able to enter the technology industry
and make more money
the whole thing
Let the Taiwanese have a destined character
It means that the children of the next generation must go on this road
Only then will they become the victorious group in life
then there is a future
good
I'm going to say this thing is not predestined
It's actually... we think historically and we'll see
It's actually a historical reason
Simply speaking
It was actually after the end of World War II
The result of the global layout of capitalist production by the United States
after World War II
U.S. in Cold War with Soviet Union
During the Cold War
One thing America is thinking about is:
How do I get the most allies?
So America did one thing
Because after World War II, Europe was basically devastated
So the United States was very rich at that time
It has invested tens of billions in European countries
That's the Marshall Plan
assist them in rebuilding their societies
The same US has also spent billions of dollars on Taiwan
It's called American aid since 1950.
Help Taiwan develop its own industry
Well, this industry actually has a very careful planning by the government.
It's not something that the free market develops at will.
it is dominated by a big government
What is this government leading?
We send Taiwan's brightest minds to America
Learn from their technology industry
After returning home after studying
Come back to open Hsinchu Science Park, open TSMC
So Taiwan is kind of like this little soldier of the United States
Why does the United States deploy this layout around the world?
because after World War II
Global powers are no longer competing with oil and steel
but wafer
The chip is actually the most important
We often talk about the arms race between the US and the Soviet Union
In fact, the most important thing in the arms race is the chip
Why the USSR lost
It is because the United States has attracted many allies to help it produce chips
And one of those allies is Taiwan
In March, Taiwan will publish a book
It's a Yale historian called "War on Chips."
just talking about this
Then Taiwan's TSMC is at the core of this matter
At the heart of this history
So this matter is a way to promote Taiwan to the status of world history
An opportunity for historians all over the world to see Taiwan
good
So what I'm going to say now is
The layout of the government 50 years ago, a decision of the government
Secretly doomed how Taiwanese people will live in the next 50 years
what kind of department are they going to study
What kind of industrial work will you do in the future?
In fact, it was determined by the history of 50 years ago.
Sounds like a fateful, fated thing
But it's actually the opposite
because what does it mean
It means anything we do now
We didn't think we'd see any results
We think that whatever we do as if it doesn't help society won't change
but if you are familiar with the history you will find
all social changes
It usually takes 50, 100 years to have an effect
That is to say, some of the decisions we are making now
He may have a great impact on Taiwan in 50 years
What about the previous speeches?
someone told me
Then you're making super crooked videos
Do you think you can really bring about any change in society?
won't you be disappointed if you don't see an immediate result
well my answer is
I tell you this history
It takes at least 50 years to see a result
It probably won't change anytime soon in our generation
But that doesn't mean what we do doesn't make sense
It just so happens that what we do is helpful to the next generation
just happens to be something worth doing
I'm talking about another thing
It’s just that I didn’t just say that the government sent a bunch of people to the United States 50 years ago
At that time, the first goal of studying abroad was to go to the United States.
Come and come to Taiwan University, go and go to America
After going to the United States, it established another character of Taiwan
It is the scholars who came back from the United States that dominate the academic circles in Taiwan.
So when they choose and employ people,
They also hope that the people who come in in the future will stay in the United States
So if I go to the UK to do my PhD
I may not be able to return to Taiwan if I get this British diploma
Taiwanese academics who want to stay in the United States
When was this matter decided?
It's not my factor and it's not their factor
They are those who returned from studying in the United States 50 years ago
The character of Taiwan's academia is established like this
but it is entirely historical
That's why I say this historical thinking is very important
We're going to think about all the problems we're having right now
Maybe it's not my problem or the other party's problem
But we are living in this history
So many things are decided in advance
i'm talking about one last thing
historical thinking
Let's think about our current social problems
does anyone know who this person is
name revealed
Hahahahahaha
If you know, we will send a small gift
I bought it at the British Museum
No one should know that he is not popular in Asia
He is very popular in Europe and America
This man's name is Henry George
Actually Henry George
He was in the Gilded Age of America in the late 19th century
After the American Wild West
A lot of small towns started to develop and the economy developed very rapidly
When this GDP grows to a high level
But at the same time a new group of poor people appeared
why?
Because when the economy grows high
Your land price will go up
There are a group of people who can't afford a house
If you can't afford a house, you end up sleeping on the streets and becoming homeless.
very much like our situation today
This actually happened once in the 19th century.
The economist at the time was Henry George
He proposed an economic theory
He said that if a society's economic growth increases
A society's economy becomes prosperous
So the value of the land goes up
Whose profit should be attributed to the added value?
shouldn't be a landlord
why
Because the landlord didn't do anything
The landlord just bought a piece of land over there
Then go on vacation
But that land has increased in value
Who is responsible for the increase in land value?
In fact, it is the credit of the whole society
For example, Taipei
Where are the areas with the highest housing prices in Taipei?
egg yolk area
Why can the housing price in the egg yolk area increase
Because there are many laborers working there
Then there are many shops
Everyone who enters Taipei will want to work there
simply put
In fact, it is the labor force as a whole that improves the prosperity of that elite area.
make everyone want to keep coming in
If all the workers are gone, the place will go down
so in short
The appreciation of land in a place is actually the credit of all citizens
So this Henry George is saying
If a piece of land increases in value it should not go to the landlord
The government should charge a land appreciation tax
Then what to do with the money after the land value-added tax comes over
That money is placed in a public treasury called Citizen's dividend
That is, the money collected from the landlord every year
Take it all and distribute it to the whole people, and share it with the whole people
So it's actually the concept of universal basic income
So we are now talking about the issue of universal basic income
more than 100 years ago
Economists have proposed the concept of universal basic income in the 19th century
this thing is not new at all
If you go back to history, you will find that this thing is not new at all.
Then Henry George's theory
Became the world's hottest land theory in the early 20th century
why
Because the early 20th century
after the war
Many new nation-states were formed around the world
Many countries are opposing European and American imperialism
So many countries in Southeast Asia and Africa began to become independent
The first problem encountered after independence was
So how are we going to distribute that land?
How to deal with the land issue?
There were only two roads
You either go capitalism to private ownership
Either go socialism and give the government ownership
But these two roads are two extremes
Henry George's economic theory gave these newly independent nations a third plan
That is, we don't need full capitalism
not fully socialist
land can be privately owned
But the value-added profit will be shared by the whole people
And this theory was seen by a Chinese
He saw this theory when he was in America
take him back to his country
This Chinese is called Sun Yat-sen
The theory of returning prices to the public comes from this economist
ok so i'm going to talk
It is the many land issues and many house price issues that we are encountering now.
It's not that no one thinks
Someone was thinking about it 100 years ago
If we go back to that period of history
we'll find out
People in the past actually provided quite a few answers.
good
I'll stop here today
To sum up, what we are talking about today is that we start with Descartes, the origin of modern thought.
then tell you
In fact, we are in the process of establishing a philosophical system
female voices are gone
Aboriginal voices lost
Then the voices of non-western countries such as Taiwan also disappeared
Finally, let's talk about Henry George talking about land appreciation
It actually silences the voice of labor
The landlord thought he earned it himself
So we're learning, say, economic theory
When philosophical theory, any Western thought
We also make certain sounds disappear
the so-called knowledge
In fact, it is to find these suppressed and disappeared voices.
That's what I want to introduce to you today
What I've learned in the past year going to London
Give everyone 10 minutes to 10 minutes to
Just now there is one place I want to hear more from you
It was mentioned just now that a child over 2 years old
He is at the stage of beginning to have memory and thinking ability
He will just forget the memory of the experience before the age of 2
this matter
i just said
This thing that the memory before the age of 2 will disappear
In medicine it is called infantile amnesia
This thing has not been explained in medicine
that psychoanalysis has some interpretations of its own
What is the interpretation of psychoanalysis?
In fact, when people are first born, there is no conscious system
His system is basically an unconscious system
That is to say
he will not have a self
he has no concept of self
he won't think it's me
What is the evidence? very simple
You go to see that kid cry
when the kid cries
if there are other kids around him
they cry together
For example, child A is crying
When child B sees child B, he will think he is crying
He cried together
He doesn't have that person and my boundaries are not very clear
From about 6 months to one year old
My boundaries are not very clear with this person
or something
Or some kids
Two one-year-old brothers or sisters
they fight each other
say i hit you
I ended up crying myself
because he thought he was beaten
Because he doesn't have that boundary with his brother
At that time the ego self hadn't grown yet
So at that time, the boundary between people and me was not very clear.
He thinks that everything around him is himself
He has no way to distinguish what is outside, what is not me and what is me
At this time there is no distinction
When can we distinguish
1 to 2 years old
When that consciousness begins to sprout gradually
Beginning to be able to distinguish what is me from what is not
For example, if there is a mother, they will know very well
At the beginning, the kid didn’t know how to call me and you
He doesn't know how to ask me to follow you
They call themselves by their own names They don't know how to call me and you
Because I am with you, you must realize that there are two subjects present.
But children are always living in their own world
only one subject is present
At that time, it was still a biological instinct, a narcissistic existence
Until about I say 1 or 2 years old
After the emergence of self-awareness
He has an extra system
called Ego, the conscious system of the ego
It was originally an unconscious system
Where did that mindless system go?
The unconscious system still exists in the human mind
But now it is dominated by the consciousness system
so the memory doesn't fade away
The memory still exists in that unconscious system.
but you can't remember
Why
because now in the daytime when you talk sober
the system you're talking to me now
the system of your conscious self
So it is not correct to say that you completely forget and cannot remember.
In fact, it exists in another system.
that system has always existed
And then that system will always affect you
It's just that you don't know how it affects you
Okay, let me give you a case of psychoanalysis.
This is a case of London
She's depressed to see this psychoanalyst
The psychoanalyst asked him why you have depression
when was your last seizure
Then she said: After I lived with my boyfriend, I got depression
very strange
She doesn't know why she always falls in love with boys from far away
That is to say, every relationship of hers is a long-distance relationship.
She's always wanted to be able to live with her boyfriend
But several appointments are long-distance love
Then finally this job finally had the chance to live together
And after the day they lived together
That girl has depression
This is a very strange thing
Why is your desire fulfilled, but you are unhappy instead?
Then she starts to analyze
analysis to the end
It turned out that when this girl was in high school
her father passed away
When his father passed away she had something to do at school
She couldn't see her father's last moments in the hospital room
So she never got a chance to say goodbye to his lover
She's been in love with a man far away since she grew up
Because when you fall in love with a man far away
You always say goodbye to him at the airport
You have many opportunities to say goodbye to your lover
So every boyfriend is really a substitute for her father
And she didn't realize
So when she moved in with her newest boyfriend
She lost the chance to say goodbye to her lover
She can't satisfy that unconscious desire
so she got depression
Well we can see that in this case
How the unconscious affects people
her memory has faded
That memory was retrieved later through psychoanalysis.
I never remembered this
It was only after doing psychoanalysis several times that I came back.
So what I'm saying is
What we call "infant amnesia" it's not really forgetting
It actually still exists in a certain part of the human thought system
unconscious system
It will always affect our real life decisions
but we don't know
how to know
you're going to do psychoanalysis
Going to Europe for psychoanalysis
Aboriginal culture may be based on animism
But like that predatory nation
Norse mythology like the Nordic peoples of Nordic people
The Mongols have their own steppe culture
Those steppe cultures are based on the background of their own mythology
But they don't live with everything
but to plunder the surrounding peasant states
Come and get more of their lives
Why are these two differences
What about your question?
It is written in the anthropologist's book I recommend
In fact, he is not only divided into two systems
I just said there are only two
Western rationality
naturalism
The other system is animism
Well, the system you mentioned is called totem belief.
Totem belief is like the Nordic you mentioned.
Then the aborigines in Australia also believe in totems
Australian aborigines are not animists but totem beliefs
For example, those with the same totem cannot be eaten.
Different totems can be eaten
So they don't say you're animistic and I can't eat you
not like this
There are 4 groups of systems in total
If you want to know more details
you can read this book
In the last part about Taiwanese culture, you said that Taiwan does not have its own culture
but i personally think
We sort of mash up a lot of different colonial experiences up to now
Can it be said that such a experience is the experience of the colonial process?
It is actually Taiwanese culture itself
Can the colonial experience be considered a cultural process?
I can give you a complicated answer or a simple answer
But many non-western countries have a history of being colonized by many western countries
If compared to the history of being colonized
Many Southeast Asian countries may have a more tragic history of being colonized
The history of colonization in Central and South America is even more tragic
but you just came up with something really interesting
Is it possible to develop a specific culture during the process of being colonized?
This is a question asked by a literary theorist called Homi Bhabha
He said actually
When we talk about colonizers and colonized
We seem to think that Hao is a foreign regime
then ruled a non-Western country
and bring their culture in
The colonized are then forced to accept their culture
It's that simple
Homi Bhabha says no, actually
It should be said that we have absorbed their culture instead.
It's not all, it's all, it's just a partial capture.
Then make a comparison with other own cultures
Like you just said we're a mixed culture
Rather than saying that we will have a very subjective
But we embrace all kinds of different cultural parts
Well what about the inclusive part?
it doesn't have to be of colonial origin
I think in Taiwan's situation
It's from immigration, not colonization
For example, you have Hakka immigrants
You have immigrants from southern China
And then you already had Aboriginal people on the land
You must have immigrants from foreigners
It is true that Taiwan has its own characteristics in this regard.
For example, when I came by high-speed rail
Mandarin, Taiwanese, Hakka, and English can be heard on the high-speed rail
four languages
Taiwan is an immigrant society, so there are these 4 types of people
And you go to the United States, Canada, Australia
They are also immigrant societies
But you go take their subway
There will not be these 4 languages
just one English
ok so at this point
Taiwan is more diverse than them
another level
It is the foreign colonial culture we just talked about
when the colonial regime came in
It's not that the colonized people just passively accept
The theory that Homi Bhabha is going to say is
The result of the struggle between the two sides is to produce a
Both absorb their own and become a hybrid
I think the most classic one should be Taiwanese food
Whether it's Italian, Japanese or European cuisine
Anyway, after coming here, it will become a Taiwanese cuisine
What about diet?
It's actually the same all over the world
Taiwan is nothing special
When cuisines from all over the world come to Taiwan, it becomes a table style
I live in Europe and so do they
Taiwanese restaurants in Europe
will be Europeanized
So it tastes different from what the hell you eat
So this matter is not special in Taiwan.
So what's the special thing I'm talking about?
Let me tell you an example and you will know.
For example, the colonial regime
For example, when the Kuomintang came to Taiwan
They brought in Mandarin
Then you can't speak Hokkien
You can't speak Hokkien
Everyone is forced to speak Mandarin, right?
And then it seems like it's an oppression
we'd say it's an oppression
But it also had an unexpected result
It is that it allows people on the entire island of Taiwan to share the same language
Then the shared same language enables all to develop a collective consciousness
For example, we can read newspapers in Mandarin
When all information is delivered in Mandarin
It can permeate all the different societies
Penetrate into Hakka society
Penetrate Aboriginal society
At that time, they were scattered all over the place
different pluralistic societies
it can be united
develop a national consciousness
is when we share the same medium
Then this language can communicate with each other
We can suddenly say that this is a society called Taiwanese
so weird
It is clearly something brought by a colonist
However, it unexpectedly promoted the unification of local people into a consciousness
When Europeans colonized the world
This result is also often produced by accident
Then when the locals united
They can turn against the colonizer
That is to say
The colonizer accidentally gave the colonized a useful tool
so that they can unite and unite against a foreign enemy
Let's take a classic example
Here is the example given by Fanon
when the french colonized algeria
They built a large number of broadcasting systems in the local area
This is the broadcast system and they all speak French
The locals are forced to learn the language
We're saying it's a colonial system
this is an oppression
But precisely because they learned French
They were originally many scattered tribes who spoke different languages
But they're all forced to speak French now.
so they have a common and uniform language
So when the Agiles were fighting the War of Independence
When it comes to independence from France
They snatched all the radio stations controlled by the French
Then speak French in French to other scattered tribes
locals can understand
If there is no such pre-colonial process
Actually you don't speak any language
Because there are so many languages ​​in the same country
But instead the colonists for the convenience of colonization
Instead, a unified language
This thing was proposed by a sociologist Benedict Anderson
imaginary community
that's the concept
The colonists were supposed to colonize you with language
However, it unexpectedly provides a very convenient tool for the colonized
a collective consciousness
to rebel against the colonizer
it's 3 o'clock
