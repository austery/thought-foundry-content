<font color=#FFF900FF>JK Rowling should be Slytherin</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>What kind of language are you talking about?</font>
In fact, in the past 100 years of Olympic history
As long as a player is viewed as not being a woman enough
Are often attacked
Gender detection methods
In fact, there has always been controversy
In today’s video, let’s talk about it
The history of Olympic gender controversies
What are the problems with gender testing?
And on the sports field
What does fair competition mean?
The modern Olympics began in the late 19th century
Founded by French Baron Pierre de Coubertin
During his 30 years as president of the Olympic Committee
Women are banned from most competitions
The Olympics are seen as an opportunity for men to show off their masculinity
Women can only do some feminine projects
Like archery, golf, tennis, swimming
At the time, the Olympic committee excluded women on medical grounds
He said he was afraid that strenuous exercise would harm women's health.
May cause infertility
to protect women
Women should not compete
So the first 30 years of the Olympics
Female players have always been in the minority
until after World War I
Thanks to the efforts of French feminist Alice Milliat
Women can finally join track and field
1928 Amsterdam Olympics
Women allowed to run 800 meters for first time
As a result, three players from Germany, Japan and Sweden broke the world record
The second-place finisher, Renji Renji, finished with a time of 2 minutes and 17 seconds.
But Japanese society at the time was very indifferent to this matter.
Some critics came out and suspected that she was actually a man.
Because only boys can run that fast
The Olympics also caused gender anxiety in European and American countries
Many parents are afraid that the next generation of girls will lose their femininity
Become an Amazon Warrior
under the pressure of public opinion
The Olympic Committee decided to start with the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics
Girls banned from running 800-meter run
Girls can only run races within 200 meters
This rule lasted until the 1960 Rome Olympics
But after banning girls from running long-distance races
Gender questioning turmoil continues to occur
1936 Berlin Olympics 100m final
American Helen Stephens breaks Poland's Stella Walsh's world record
Become the fastest woman in the world
The Polish newspapers at that time immediately came out and questioned that
Helen Stephens is actually a man
Because people at that time didn't believe that women could run so fast
causing public outcry
The Olympic Committee then conducted a gender test on Helen Stephens
So the Olympic gender test
At the very beginning
It’s not as simple as fair competition
But I don’t believe that women can have the same physical abilities as men.
When women challenge existing gender boundaries
When you act too much like a man
will be asked to prove that she is a real woman
During the post-war Cold War period between the United States and the Soviet Union
Both the United States and the Soviet Union wanted to exploit the role of women
to show their national strength
Western countries discourage women from participating in sports
Think women stay indoors and be housewives
That's a good kind of woman
The Soviet Union promoted gender equality
Encourage women to participate in all sports
Attempts to use the Olympics to increase the Soviet Union's international visibility
So the female Olympic athletes sent by the Soviet Union all had big muscles.
compared to other countries
Women in the USSR won more medals than men
The United States did not expect to lose to the Soviet Union in sports events
And she was the woman who lost to the Soviet Union
This made the Western camp suspicious
Questioning the gender of these players
Said they were all men disguised as women
Like the Soviet athletes Irina Press and Tamara Press in the 1960 Olympics
Won 5 gold medals and 1 silver medal
I was told that my muscles were too strong
Not like a woman
So from 1966 to 1992
The International Association of Athletics Federations stipulates that gender testing must be mandatory before competitions
How to detect it?
At the 1966 European Athletics Championships
243 female contestants had to line up naked
Showing genitals in front of doctor
British player Mary Peters recalls
This is the most humiliating experience in my life
british magazine of the time
He even joked about gender testing.
To test whether they are women, just let them sleep with men.
So from the perspective of historical development
Mandatory gender checks
In the beginning, it was not as simple as demanding fairness.
It also touches on the Western gender framework
The Cold War Rivalry with the United States and the Soviet Union
Because of the outstanding performance of Soviet female athletes
It was not in line with what Western countries believed at the time.
Women should have a soft and elegant image
That’s why I’m constantly being questioned about my gender.
Only then did they force the organizers to use gender testing
The original gender test was to strip naked and have it examined by a doctor.
This is both inefficient and inappropriate
So in 1967
International Athletic Association changes method
No longer judge by body structure
Instead, we turn to chromosomes to judge
Only XX chromosomes can be added
Anyone who doesn’t have one is prohibited from participating.
This method only needs to detect the oral mucosa and is very convenient
This is also the testing method that JK Rowling is asking the Olympics to reimplement.
But this approach actually causes greater controversy
Polish player Ewa Kłobukowska was found to have XXY chromosomes instead of XX
Her medal from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics was confiscated
Also banned from playing
This caused her to suffer from mental illness afterwards
Even attempted suicide
But this incident made the organizers think that
Sure enough, implementing gender testing is correct
Poland's Olympic Committee president protests
Just looking at XX chromosomes is not enough to define a woman
We generally think of gender as dichotomous
The sex chromosomes of the horse must be XX (female), otherwise it will be XY (male)
But biologist Anne Fausto-Sterling compiled data from 1955 to 2000
Half a century of medical literature
Statistics show that nearly 1.7% of people were not classified as "either gender" at birth.
For example, someone develops like a female but has XY chromosomes
(androgen insensitivity syndrome)
Some boys will lose their Y chromosome in certain cells as they grow up.
Why is there so much change in gender development?
Today's scientific community believes
Everyone in the embryonic stage
They were all androgynous in the beginning.
The structure of the human gonads inherently has bisexual potential (bipotential)
The gender development process of a fetus
In fact, several sets of genes for "becoming a man" and "becoming a woman" compete with each other.
It's like there are a group of men and women fighting for 300 rounds inside the body
The final total points obtained
determines the unique gender development of the fetus
So it’s a natural developmental variation
Creating diversity in biological sex
There are not only two types of gene expression, but a continuous spectrum.
But according to the standards of the Olympic Committee at that time (1967)
Have female characteristics but no XX chromosomes
would be considered a physiological "abnormality"
not seen as a real woman
At the 1968 Mexico City Olympics
Players will receive a female card after gender testing
Prove that there are no abnormalities in the chromosome test
Female players must have this card before they can participate
This caused concern among the scientific community at the time
At the 1972 Sapporo Olympics in Japan
Five Danish doctors criticize Olympic gender testing as unethical
Because the Olympics define what it means to be a woman
You must have XX chromosomes to be a woman
but did not consider other factors
such as gonadal development, secondary sex characteristics, gender identity
These are also the decisive factors for becoming a woman
Like the ever-victorious Olympic athlete Stella Walsh from Poland
I've always been suspected of not being a real woman
She was killed by robbers in 1980
Forensic autopsy revealed she had androgynous characteristics
is intersex
Many people sent letters to the Olympic Committee saying
How can this fake woman be allowed to compete?
Her medal should be confiscated
The Olympic Committee therefore has more legitimate reasons to say: Look
Gender testing is necessary
So after the 1980s
Gender testing becomes more stringent
But this event ignored
When Stella Walsh was born, medical technology in 1911 did not yet have chromosome testing.
At that time, the doctor determined that she was female
She also identifies as female
She has lived her whole life as a woman
However, after his death, he was found to have intersex characteristics.
and was deprived of her qualification as a female player.
This makes the Olympic Committee's gender testing
brought greater controversy
Using only chromosomes to determine gender has led to many protests
The detection technology at that time was immature
In fact, there are many misjudgments
For example, Kirsten Wengler, an American female athlete who went to Japan to participate in the international swimming competition in 1985
It was mistakenly detected to have a Y chromosome
Next, medical groups came out to protest, claiming that chromosome testing was inaccurate.
Didn’t take into account that humans don’t only have two combinations of XX and XY
Chromosomes also have many other variations
And this mutation will not give players an innate advantage.
For example, the hurdler who was supposed to represent Spain in the 1988 Olympics
Maria José Martínez-Patiño
But he was disqualified because he failed the gender test.
She was diagnosed with XY chromosomes at the time
considered male
But she actually has "androgen insensitivity syndrome"
This genetic mutation makes it harder for the body's male hormones to work
So even if she has XY chromosomes
Nor will it allow her to gain the natural male advantage
At that time, scientists used this reason to defend her.
Only then did she successfully get back the qualification from the International Athletics Federation.
Because there were so many protests in the 1980s
So in 1990
International Athletics President holds a meeting in Monte Carlo
Invite professionals from all walks of life to discuss
At that time, many doctors suggested that gender testing should be abolished
But the Olympic Committee said
Gender testing is necessary to ensure fairness
The question is just how to detect
Finally decided to adopt PCR testing
It’s nucleic acid testing
Because this detection method is fast and convenient
But PCR tests were quickly called into question
In 1994, it was time for Norway to host the Olympic Games.
Norway is the Western country that values ​​gender equality most
Gender testing is only for women
It’s differential treatment of women
So the Norwegian government legislated to ban PCR testing
Saying this is both illegal and unethical
Norwegian scientists also refused to do this kind of testing for the Olympics
This became a turning point in the history of the Olympic Games
The Norwegian government's tough stance has inspired many Olympians
Organizing Committee Protests Gender Testing
The Olympics only ended gender testing in 1999
When only the players are questioned
will require testing
Beginning in 1984, China’s rise
Starting to return to the Olympics
The number of medals won by the Chinese team is astonishing
Especially female athletes
It also broke multiple world records
Like in 1993
Track and field athlete Wang Junxia set three world records
Known as the "Oriental Sacred Deer"
World record of 3,000 meters: 8 minutes and 06 seconds
Still not broken
At the 1996 Atlanta Olympics
Wang Junxia wins another 5,000m gold medal
<font color=#FFF900FF>She is about to take
the first ever Olympic five thousand meter title,</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF> Of course, this will be a new Olympic record</font> <font color=#FFF900FF>
and of course it will be a new Olympic record.</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>14 minutes 59 seconds 90</font>
These feats did not impress Western countries.
Instead, it makes them question
How can Asian women win so many medals?
At that time, American long-distance runner PattiSue Plumer said
"The Chinese have broken so many world records,
it needs investigation."
'but to smash those records by that much,
it needs investigation'.
U.S. asks IAAF to restart gender testing measures
Wang Junxia’s family even received death threats
Behind this series of attacks
We can see a pattern
gender questioning events
Often when white women lose to non-white women
For example, Lin Yuting and Kelly Ford were attacked by JK Rowling this time.
Neither of these two people happen to be white.
And the opponents they defeated happened to be white.
this is no coincidence
if the situation were reversed
When a white woman beats a non-white woman
Maybe there won’t be so many doubts
Like the 1972 Munich Olympics
Australian swimmer Shane Gould wins three gold medals and breaks three world records
No one questioned her gender at the time
Because her appearance conforms to the ideal image of a typical Western white woman
In contrast, people who do not fit this profile
You may be questioned as not being a woman
Like at the 2006 Asian Games
India's Santhi Soundarajan wins 800m silver medal
But because she doesn’t look feminine enough
And was questioned after the game
Being asked to take a gender test
As a result, the medal was confiscated due to failure.
Sandra Young later suffered from severe depression
He attempted suicide and was sent to the hospital.
And at the 2009 World Championships
South African sprinter Caster Semenya wins his third world championship in a row
Elisa Cusma, the Italian player who lost to her at the time, said:
"She shouldn't run with us. She is a man." "These kind
of people should not run with us. She is a man."
Once again
We see white people questioning non-white people as less like women
<font color=#FFF900FF>18-year-old Semenya is undergoing a gender verification test</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>The eighteen year old Simania is now the subject of a gender verification test.</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>We have more now in
a controversy that has erupted</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Whether one of the runners should be in
the men's or women's race.</font>
Because there are too many doubts
International Athletics president asks Semenya to take gender test
Test results showed she had naturally high testosterone
Therefore, in 2011
Olympic Committee introduces testosterone limits
Women thought to have high levels of male hormones produce more testosterone
Have a sporting advantage
But think of testosterone as a masculine hormone that enhances motor function
It is itself a long-term prejudice of Western culture
There is no scientific evidence to support
Scientists still have not found a direct causal link between testosterone and sports performance
Male athletes with low testosterone actually make up the majority in sports events
In 2018
World Athletics President requires Samanya to undergo treatment
Reduce testosterone in the body
meet women's standards
to continue to participate in international competitions
Semenya believed this was discrimination and filed a complaint with the International Association of Athletics Federations.
2019 court ruling released
Ruled that Semenya would be unfair to other female contestants
<font color=#FFF900FF>the Sports world's highest court ruled yesterday</font> <font color=#FFF900FF>
the Sports world's highest court ruled yesterday</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>that Semenya must take medication to reduce her unusually high testosterone level if she wants to compete.</font>
Semenya then appealed to the European Court of Human Rights
Will be judged in favor of the case in 2023
Rules international farm ban discriminatory
<font color=#FFF900FF>
And a ruling on Tuesday the European court of human rights</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>found that
the south African runner had been discriminated against</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>when she was ordered to take medication to lower her testosterone levels in order to compete as a woman</font> <font color=#FFF900FF> be allowed to compete as a woman.</font>
If we look carefully at the history of sports competitions over the past 100 years
we will find
causing gender controversy
It's often the case that non-whites win over whites
So it's not just gender issues involved here
There are also racial factors intertwined
In fact, when the Olympic Games were first established,
Originally a Western country
Used to demonstrate white superiority
Like the 1936 Berlin Olympics
Nazi Germany hoped to prove this
Aryans are the best race
But in the 20th century
With the rise of China and Asian countries
More non-whites are winning medals
poses a threat to white dominance
<font color=#FFF900FF>The 49-year-old famous Australian swimming coach Hawke</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Get angry on IG</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>The target is mainland swimming youngster Pan Zhanle</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>At the Paris Olympics a few days ago</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>With the difference of one body position</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Won the men’s 100-meter freestyle championship</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>also set an amazing world record</font>
So we keep accusing people of color of being ineligible.
Not womanly enough
This actually reflects
The white man lost the game, but still has to maintain the anxiety of racial superiority.
Finally, let’s talk about what it means to be fair in sports.
Every time there is a gender-questioning controversy
The organizers will say
Gender testing is for fair competition
Because biological males have innate genetic advantages
unfair to female players
<font color=#FFF900FF>This is an unfair competition</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Athletes who I think have male genetic characteristics</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>should not be allowed to compete in female competitions</font>
If fairness is required
What matters is genetic fairness
Then we can ask:
Humans have 46 pairs of chromosomes, why do we only pursue the fairness of sex chromosomes?
For example, American swimmer Michael Phelps won 28 Olympic gold medals
The length of his torso and the back of his hands are different from ordinary people's
Physiological structure that exceeds that of average boys
Even compared to other boys
He is also born with physiological advantages
But you won't see anyone else saying it's unfair
To take away his gold medal
Or ask him to adjust his gender biochemical index
Reach the normal value for average boys
Instead, you will hear many people praising him and saying:
This guy was born to swim.
<font color=#FFF900FF>While a long upper body forms a sculpted v shape that begins with wide shoulders , </font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>And concludes with narrow hips and
a flat backside.</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Put it all together, and you've got a human speedboat skinning water surf</font> <font color=#FFF900FF>Put it together,
and you've got a human speedboat skinning water surf .</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Superman sets another record</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Superman does it again.</font>
In fact, in 1990
The International Athletics Association once wanted to do health checks for men too
But at the time, it was criticized as unnecessary and too redundant.
so we should think
Why is it acceptable in the male community for someone to be born above average?
But among women
Some people are born with higher than average testosterone levels
People can't accept it
think this is unfair
Does this reflect the subconscious mind of society as a whole?
In fact, there is a fear that women will become too powerful
I don’t believe that women can achieve better sports results than women
Like you won't see anyone questioning the gender of a figure skater
Because this kind of movement is in line with the traditional image of women in society
Gender will be suspected
They are usually more masculine sports.
Such as boxing, weightlifting, track and field
Requires fitness, strength, speed
If any female player is too strong, too strong, or too fast
As powerful as a man
will be suspected of not being a woman enough
Especially non-white players
But the purpose of sports competition
Isn’t it necessary to select the strongest, strongest, and fastest player?
When these players meet these conditions
Will be said to be too much
Not like a woman at all
Ignoring the years of training behind these players
years of hard work
It was written off by "You don't look like a woman"
This is the biggest injustice to athletes, right?
The greater injustice is
Different institutions have different standards for defining what constitutes a real woman.
Different institutions have different standards for defining what constitutes a real woman.
Lin Yuting before competing in the Olympics
Has passed the Olympic Committee’s testosterone concentration testing standards
But those who question her gender
But take the 2023 World Championships as an example
At that time, the International Boxing Federation detected that her "gender biochemical index" exceeded the standard.
<font color=#FFF900FF>In a statement
, the IBA said in part</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>This test conclusively indicated that both athletes did not meet necessary eligibility criteria</font> <font color=#FFF900FF>This test conclusively indicated
that both athletes did not meet necessary eligibility criteria </font> >
<font color=#FFF900FF>found that they had competitive advantages over other female competitors.</font> <font color=#FFF900FF>
and were found to have competitive advantages over other female competitors.</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>a boxer deemed a biological male beating an Italian female opponent.</font> <font color=#FFF900FF>a boxer deemed
a biological male beating an Italian female opponent. </font> >
<font color=#FFF900FF>with the Italian crying out: I couldn't take it anymore.</font> <font color=#FFF900FF>with the Italian crying out: I
couldn't take it anymore.</font> >
Take a step back and say yes
So what if Lin Yuting's certain index exceeded the standard at that time?
Athletes’ physiological state and hormone concentration
It will change with the training of the body
The focus is on the period before the game
Is there any concentration that exceeds the standard?
<font color=#FFF900FF>Are these two athletes women? </font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>re these athletes women? </font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>The answer is yes
.</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>According to eligibility
, according to their passports, according to the history.</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>
A test which may have happened overnight was a made up test, which is new.< /font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>I don't think we should give that
any credence at all.</font>
at Olympic events
The test results of this year’s Olympic Committee will not be used.
Instead, use the test results from last year’s International Boxing Association.
Isn't that weird?
Now the International Boxing Association has been expelled from the Olympic Committee
Using tests performed by the delisted institution to question a player’s eligibility
It’s hard to believe that there is any legitimacy to this kind of questioning
In this episode we look at the history of gender controversies in the Olympics
In fact, Lin Yuting faces various international doubts today.
In the history of the Olympic Games, there have been many
from the very beginning
I don’t believe that women can have the same physical abilities as men
And then to the fact that Soviet female athletes did not conform to the Western image of women
The Olympic Committee just started to implement mandatory gender testing
But there are many problems with chromosome testing
Use a single metric to define what it means to be a woman
Ruined the athletic careers of many female athletes
Until the massive protests of the 1980s
Only then did gender testing finally end in 1999
But as more and more non-white athletes win medals
White superiority challenged
In turn, he questions that many non-white players are not women.
Require gender testing to ensure fair competition
But this argument always only applies to female players
It seems to reflect that society does not dare to imagine women becoming too powerful
Too masculine and too competitive
If we really want to achieve fairness in sports events,
We need a massive social reform of gender culture
Let every player on the sports field
Everyone can exert their best strength
Show the results of your efforts
I will not be denied my past efforts because of my gender.
Even if you encounter all kinds of gender doubts and slanders,
We can also defend the dignity that our own players deserve
Let me reincarnate and start over again
I might still choose boxing
I just want to take advantage of the Paris Olympics.
For yourself and for Taiwan
Get an Olympic gold medal that belongs to Taiwan
