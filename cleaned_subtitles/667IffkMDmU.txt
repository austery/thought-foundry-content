smart people really underrate Espionage right and you know I think part of the security issue is I think people don't realize like how intense state level Espionage can be right like you know you know this Israel company had had software that could just zero click hack any iPhone right they just put in your number and then it's just like straight download of everything right like United States infiltrated an airga atomic weapons program right wild you know like are you talking about so yeah yeah um you know the you know you know intelligence agencies have just stockpiles of of of of zero days you know when things get really hot you know I don't know maybe they'll send Special Forces right to like you know get go to the data center or something that's you know or you know I mean China does this they threaten people's families right and they're like look if you don't cooperate if you don't give us the Intel um uh there's there's a good book you know along the lines of the the gulag Oro you know the um inside the aquarium um which is by a g Soviet Gru Defector um Gru was like Military Intelligence IL recommended this book to me you know I think reading that it was just kind of like shocked that I have a 10 sort of state level espionageshitposts the whole book was about like they go to these European countries and they try to like get all the technology and recruit all these people to get the technology um I mean yeah maybe one anecdote you know so when so this spy he you know this eventual Defector you know so he's being trained he goes to the kind of Gru Spy Academy and so then to to graduate from the Spy Academy sort of before you're sent abroad you kind of had to pass a test to show that you can do this and the test was you know you had to in Moscow recruit a Soviet scientist and recruit them to give you information sort of like you would do in in the foreign country um but of course for whomever you recruited the penalty for giving away sort of secret information was death and so to graduate from the Soviet spy the gru Spy Academy um you had to condemn a countryman to death MH states do this stuff you know you got to have Russia proof security right it's like you you can't you can't just have Russia steal all your stuff and like maybe their clusters aren't going to be as big but like they're still going to be able to make the crazy bioweapons and the you know the mosquitoz drum swor you know and so on and um so I mean I think I think I think the security component is just actually a pretty large component of the project in the sense of like I currently do not see another way where we don't kind of like instantly proliferate this to everybody so like right now how how easy would it be for uh for an actor to steal the things that are like not not the things that are released about Scarlet Johansson's voice but the the RL things are talking about the UN hings I mean I mean all extremely easy right you know I you know deep mind even like you know they they don't make a claim that it's hard right de deep mine put out their like whatever Frontier safety something and they like lay out security levels and they you know security levels 0 to four and four is the res and resistant to State actors and they say we're at level zero right and then you know I mean just recently there's like an indictment of a guy who just like stole the code a bunch of like really important AI code and went to China with it and you know all he had to do to steal the code was uh you know copy the code and put it into Apple notes and then exported as PDF and that got past their monitoring right and you know Google is the best security of any of AI Labs probably because they have the you know the Google infrastructure I mean I think I don't know roughly I would think of this as like you know uh security of a startup right and like what does security of a startup look like right you know it's not that good it's it's it's easy to steal is it just a matter of getting the right pin drive and you plug it into the gigawatt data center next to the three gorgeous Dam and then you're off to the races I mean look there's a few different things right so one one threat model is just stealing the weights themselves and I and the weights one is sort of particularly insane right because they can just like steal the literal like end product right just like make a replica of the bomb and then they're just like ready to go and um you know I think that one just is you know extremely important around the time we have AGI and super intelligence right because it's um you know China can build a big cluster by default we'd have a big lead right because we have the better scientists but we make the super intelligence they just steal it they're Off to the Races weights are a little bit less important right now um because you know who cares if they still the gb4 weights right like whatever um and um so you know we still have to get started on weight security now because you know look if we think AGI 27 you know this stuff is going to take a while and it you know it doesn't you know it's not just going to be like oh we we we do some Access Control it's going you know if you actually want to be resistant to sort of Chinese Espionage you know it needs to be much more intense um the thing though that I think you know people aren't paying enough attention to is the secrets as you say and um you know I think this is you know the compute stuff is sexy you know we talk about it but you know I think that you I think people underrate the secrets um because they're you know I think the you know the half in order of magnitude a year just by default sort of algorithmic progress that's huge you know if we have a fewy year lead by by default you know that's 10 30X 100x bigger cluster if we protected them you know I don't think anyone has really gotten up in front of these people and been like look you know the thing you're building is the most important thing for like the National Security of the United States for like whether you know like you know the Free World will have another Century ahead of it like this is this thing you're doing is really important like for your country for democracy um and um you know don't talk about the secrets and it's not just about you know deep mind or whatever it's about it's about you know these really important things
