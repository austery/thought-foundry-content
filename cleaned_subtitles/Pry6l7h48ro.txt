Raise your hand
if you don't know what this is.
That is a human brain turned to glass
during the Mount Vesuvius eruption.
But it gets weirder.
Only this man's brain turned to glass,
not his other organs,
leaving scientists baffled
about how ash clouds could create
the precise temperature conditions
to forge glass from living tissue.
If you didn't know what this was,
then you're exactly where you should be.
Because this talk
is about the power of not knowing.
Here's why this matters now
more than ever.
We live in a culture
that's absolutely obsessed
with having the right answer immediately.
Social media rewards confident hot takes
over curious questions.
Everyone is supposed to be an expert
in everything all the time.
Get something remotely wrong -- canceled.
It's exhausting.
But I think I found another way.
When I started my channel,
Today I Learned,
in two years over two
million people followed.
Not for expert opinions or hot takes,
but for something simpler:
shared curiosity.
Which is ironic because I used to be
the complete opposite.
Before this I was
a recovering know-it-all,
actually a wannabe know-it-all
who was failing spectacularly at it.
During my doctorate at UCSF,
I was obsessed with certainty
and having the right answer
before anyone even asked the question.
When COVID hit,
I started posting science videos
as a creative outlet,
but even then I constrained myself.
Only post about things you know, Harini,
so I stuck rigidly to pharmacy topics,
my supposed area of expertise.
And let me tell you,
it was real riveting stuff.
Then I went to Mexico.
I was standing in front
of the Teotihuacán pyramids
in the blazing heat
when I realized something profound.
I had no idea what I was looking at.
Who built this?
Why here?
Where did they go?
Instead of feeling embarrassed
that I didn't know,
I felt alive.
Every carving was a mystery
that made my brain tingle
in ways that pharmaceutical
calculations never did.
That night, I couldn't stop researching.
Not to become an expert,
but to feed my curiosity.
I made a video about Teotihuacán,
posted it and went to sleep,
expecting my usual three likes
from my parents and my husband.
I woke to 40,000 new followers.
My first viral video had nothing to do
with my eight years of higher education.
It was about me, a human being,
nerding out over ancient architecture
and then sharing the incredible
work of the archaeologists
who spent lifetimes piecing together
the mysteries of Teotihuacán.
Here's what hit me.
People weren't following me
because I was an expert.
They were following me
because I was curious.
And curiosity is contagious.
Because here is the paradox of our time.
We have infinite access to information,
but also infinite misinformation.
Conspiracy theories get more clicks
than peer-reviewed studies.
Confident nonsense spreads faster
than careful science.
In that chaos,
championing credible voices
and making that work accessible
seem to unlock something in people.
Because after that,
my comments exploded
with TIL: Today I Learned.
In that moment, my mission became clear.
Take the most rigorous,
mind-blowing research
and make it so captivating
that someone scrolling at 2am
stops and goes, “Wait, what?”
Because science is for everyone,
not dumbed down,
but translated with
the excitement it deserves.
I changed my channel name that night
and didn't look back.
Here's where my curiosity has taken me.
There is a 72-year-old geologist
who rewrote the origins of life,
before GTA 6.
Juan Manuel Garcia Ruiz
could have retired,
but instead he chose to recreate
the famous 1952
primordial soup experiment,
the one that showed us
how life began on Earth.
But with one tiny change.
Instead of using a glass container
like the original, he used Teflon.
The result?
Nothing.
Turns out the glass,
specifically the silica, was key.
When he added silica back in,
he didn't just get amino acids,
he got all five DNA building blocks
and protocells.
The self-organizing structures
that came right before actual life.
Translation?
Life on Earth may have started
hundreds of millions of years earlier
than we thought.
This should be breaking the internet,
but most people will never hear about it.
That is the gap I'm trying to bridge.
Because science isn't just for scientists.
When researchers discover how life began
or unlock how ancient brains
turned to glass,
these are ultimately human stories
about curiosity, perseverance,
asking brave questions.
And everyone deserves
to feel that electrifying,
“I can’t believe we just
learned that” moment.
Like this.
For the first time in 2025,
we got to witness a human embryo
implanting into uterine-like tissue
in real time.
From this, we learn
embryos aggressively burrow,
possibly following uterine
contractions like GPS signals.
This process is actually
physically painful.
The countless women
who felt a sharp twinge
and wondered if they'd imagined it,
they didn't.
Science just caught up
to what their bodies already knew.
We finally answered one of human
development's biggest black boxes,
while validating millions
of women's experiences in the process.
After doing this for a few years,
here's what I've learned.
People don't make discoveries
because they already know things.
They make discoveries
because they get obsessed
with the stuff they don't know.
And learning isn't linear.
It's a beautiful, endless loop.
When I shared my Teotihuacán obsession,
I was inviting 40,000 other people
to be curious with me
and showing them that science
can be as captivating
as any Netflix series.
See, my doctorate taught me
how to read studies and think critically.
But my channel taught me that everyone
deserves access to that knowledge.
So here's my challenge for you.
Find your Teotihuacán.
Find the thing that lights
you up from the inside,
not because you understand it,
but because you don't.
Maybe it's quantum physics.
Maybe it's how sourdough starter
is basically a pet you can eat.
Whatever makes you feel like that kid
that asked "why" over and over
until your parents wanted to scream.
When I first started dating my husband,
he called me "20 questions."
Bring that energy to the table.
TLDR: stay gloriously,
unapologetically curious.
All right, that's it from me,
I've got to go research
how the real city Atlanta
is buried beneath our feet.
Thank you.
