Sam Alman just raised $500 billion for project Stargate his quest for artificial general intelligence the pitch AGI will solve everything so any investment no matter how large is Justified meanwhile a Chinese competitor deep seek achieved similar results for just $6 million nvidia's stock plummeted nearly 20% in a few days and what many believe is the AI bubble has started to burst but here's the interesting part even as hundreds of billions in market value evapor the major players will likely walk away richer than ever turns out this is a common pattern in asset bubbles if they know what they're doing people still get rich even when the bubble bursts so let's explore how the wealthy exploit these bubbles starting with the first and most crucial step spotting the next Revolution before everyone else does getting rich during asset bubbles starts with a simple truth find the next big thing before everyone knows it's the Next Big Thing This Means identifying potentially revolutionary Technologies or markets when they're still unproven when most people are still skeptical and the technology itself might be rough around the edges history shows us how this plays out during theom bubble Jeff Bezos and Pierre omdar saw something most people missed the internet wasn't just a fancy way to send emails it was going to transform how we buy and sell everything their companies Amazon and eBay weren't profitable at at first Amazon's early nickname was amazon. bomb talk about a vote of confidence but they understood that revolutionizing retail was worth more than immediate profits this pattern keeps repeating in crypto vitalic butterin and Satoshi Nakamoto pitched a radical idea what if we could have money and financial systems without banks with AI companies like Nvidia bet big on producing specialized chips years before anyone was asking chat GPT to write their resignation letters even the real estate bubble followed this rule early investors in mortgage backed Securities thought they discovered a new foolproof way to invest in housing spoiler alert nothing in finance is foolproof but here's the crucial point in each case early investors weren't betting on what these Technologies could do at the time they were betting on what these Technologies promised to become the technology doesn't need to be perfect it just needs to be revolutionary enough to make people believe it could change everything and that leads us to our next step in the bubble Playbook once you found your revolutionary idea how do you convince everyone else it's going to change the world once you've spotted your potentially world changing technology the next step is arguably the most crucial selling the dream it's not enough to have a revolutionary idea you need to convince everyone else that this revolution is inevitable in the world of asset bubbles this means painting a picture of a utopian future so compelling that it makes current limitations seem like mere speed bumps on the road to Paradise consider how theom bubble turned every website into a potential Amazon pets.com wasn't just selling pet food online they were revolutionizing pet care for the digital age never mind that shipping 50 lb bags of dog food at a loss wasn't exactly a sustainable business model the vision of clicking a button and having everything delivered to your door was too seductive to resist the crypto bubble mastered this art of narrative ethereum wasn't merely a new technology it was freedom from Banks governments and all those pesky middlemen taking their cut the fact that most people were buying crypto purely to sell it for more traditional money later was apparently beside the point now we're seeing the same pattern with AI companies aren't just developing algorithms they're promising to solve everything from cancer to climate change Google and Microsoft aren't selling software updates they're selling a future where AI handles all the grunt work while humans focus on higher Pursuits here's the key thing about these Visions they aren't necessarily lies the internet did revolutionize Commerce cryptocurrency is changing Finance AI will transform Industries the flaw isn't in the vision itself but in the oversimplified path to getting there real transformation requires rewriting social contracts and changing ingrained behaviors Minor Details that don't make for great sales pitches but selling the dream is only part of the equation to really profit from a bubble you need something more concrete while dreamer sell visions of Utopia the real money in bubbles often comes from selling the tools to build that Utopia these are the shovel makers the companies and individuals who create the essential infrastructure that helps a speculative bubble grow think of them as the clever Merchants who got rich selling pickaxes during the Gold Rush While most Prospectors went broke hunting for gold in the bubble companies like Akamai Technologies were the quiet winners while Amazon was burning cash trying to revolutionize retail aamai was profitably building the content delivery networks that made the internet actually usable today's equivalent in crypto would be coinbase and binance exchanges that make money regardless of whether Bitcoin goes to the moon or crashes back to Earth they profit from every trade in both directions Nvidia perfected this strategy in the AI boom while everyone debates whether AI will achieve Consciousness Nvidia sits back and sells the chips that power every major AI model their gpus are the modern-day pickaxes and they're selling them at a premium to every prospector in town even the housing bubble had its infrastructure players mortgage brokers appraisers and real estate agents made fortunes by facilitating deals regardless of whether the underlying properties were actually worth their inflated prices here's the beauty of the shovel strategy while it might seem less exciting than betting on the next Amazon or Bitcoin it's often more reliable after all in a gold rush you don't need to find gold yourself you just need others to keep believing they might find it but to really amplify these gains you need bigger players to enter the game that's where institutional investors come in once you have your revolutionary technology a compelling narrative and the infrastructure to support it it's time to bring in the big guns institutional investors these aren't your regular retail investors buying stocks on Robin Hood these are the heavyweight firms with billions to deploy their entry does two things it legitimizes your bubble and more importantly inflates valuations to astronomical levels remember when Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank poured billions into Doom IPOs suddenly companies like webvan and pets.com weren't just amb vicious startups they were transformative Enterprises worth billions on paper never mind that they were burning cash faster than a Bitcoin mining rig in the Sahara the crypto World saw the same pattern when micro strategy Tesla and major investment firms started buying Bitcoin their involvement wasn't just about investment it was about validation each announcement sent prices soaring creating a feedback loop of fomo and speculation now look at AI Microsoft multi-billion dollar investment in open AI didn't just give Sam alman's company a Skyhigh valuation it signaled to every other Institutional Investor that AI was the next Gold Rush the result an unprecedented flood of capital into anything with AI in its pitch deck what makes institutional investment so powerful is its self-fulfilling nature when big players invest they're incentivized to maintain or increase the value of their Investments they have the resource and influence to keep the bubble inflating at least until they can position themselves for a profitable exit and that's where we get to the most crucial skill in bubble writing knowing when to get out timing your exit is the difference between being Mark Cuban and being the person who bought broadcast.com stock right before the crash Cuban sold his company to Yahoo for 5.7 billion in 1999 just months before the dot bubble burst while everyone else was watching their portfolios evaporate Cuban was watching the Dallas Mavericks from his newly purchased courtside seats this is where the true art of bubble writing comes in the trick isn't just recognizing when valuations have become absurd they're usually absurd from the start it's recognizing when the narrative that's been driving the bubble starts to crack it's about noticing when revolutionary technology headlines start getting replaced with is it really worth this much articles during the crypto bubble early Bitcoin investors who sold during the 2017 Peak or the 2021 rally walked away with life-changing gains meanwhile those who held on believing in digital gold watched their portfolios drop by over 70% in Real Estate Investors who sold their properties in 2006 when everyone else was still buying protected themselves from the 2008 crash that wiped out trillions in home equity but here's the uncomfortable truth about Bubble exits the Insiders VCS institutional investors and early adopters usually have a significant Advantage they have better information more influence and often the ability to coordinate their exits by the time the average investor realizes the bubble is bursting the smart money has already left the building however creating and riding bubbles isn't just about getting in early and selling before the crash there's one more crucial element that keeps the whole machine running Manufacturing fomo the final ingredient in any successful bubble is pure psychological warfare creating and maintaining fear of missing out fomo isn't just a buzzword it's the rocket fuel that propels asset bubbles to their dizzying heights and the true masters of bubble writing aren't just participating in this psychology they're actively engineering it during the Doom era every new story about a College Dropout becoming a millionaire created a new wave of investors afraid of missing the the next Microsoft in crypto influencers and Tech Visionaries like Elon Musk could move markets with a single tweet creating a constant fear that the next big pump was just around the corner now in AI we see companies racing to announce their AI initiatives each claiming to be at the Forefront of a revolution that's inevitable and imminent this manufactured fomo creates a powerful feedback loop as prices rise media coverage intensifies as coverage intensifies more investors Pile in as as more investors Pile in prices rise further the cycle continues until reality finally catches up with the narrative and this brings us to the fundamental truth about getting rich in asset bubbles it's not about believing in the long-term potential of the technology it's about understanding and exploiting the predictable psychology of Market Manas the same patterns repeat because human nature doesn't change whether it's tulips in 1637 or AI in 2024 bubbles are built on the same Foundation of early adoption compelling narratives infrastructure plays institutional validation and carefully manufactured fomo yes most of these revolutionary Technologies do end up changing the world the internet did transform Commerce blockchain is reshaping Finance AI will likely revolutionize countless Industries but the fortunes made during bubbles rarely come from waiting for these long-term transformations they come from understanding this framework recognizing where we are in the cycle and most importantly knowing when to stop playing the game
