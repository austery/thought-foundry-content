After the release of "Taipei Women's Guide"
There have been many criticisms and discussions on the Internet
Deliberately exaggerating the gap between North and South
At the same time angered people in Taipei and Tainan
Why did the heroine go to Taipei?
all these questions
Actually they all revolve around the same question:
What kind of city is Taipei?
over the past half century
"What is Taipei?" has always been the core question that many Taiwanese films try to answer
The first Taiwanese film named after Taipei was "The Morning Train from Taipei" in 1964
He was the first to discuss the modernity trauma brought about by the gap between Taiwan’s urban and rural areas on Taiwanese.
The hero and heroine are a pair of childhood sweethearts in rural Changhua
The heroine was forced to go to Taipei to find a job because of her father's debt
The contrast between the city and the countryside is used extensively in the film
Taiwanese songs are played in Changhua, but American jazz is played in Taipei
It also uses trains and rails as metaphors leading to the modern city of Taipei.
The train has always been a symbol of modern cinema
The first movie in history, "The Train Comes In"
It marked the birth of modern cinema, but it also caused panic among Parisian audiences
In today's Japanese and Korean movies
Trains are more used to highlight the symptoms of modern society
In "Doomsday Train"
The world beyond the train is a global ecological catastrophe
The world inside the train is the class struggle in capitalist society
In "Corpse Train"
The high-speed train to Busan is also the origin of turning people into zombies
In "Ghost Slayer"
The high-speed infinite train is actually a monster that devours the common people as nourishment
in these movies
As the train moves forward, it brings greater disasters
Reflecting Japan and Korea in the 21st century
Pursue progress all the way and catch up with the sequelae of Western modern society:
Wealth gap, cultural loss, debt problem
same
In "Morning Train from Taipei"
The hero who can't adapt to the modern urban life accidentally loses his sight
Like a high-speed train to Taipei
"Run over" those Taiwanese who are still living in traditional society
Here we see the difference from the "Taipei Women's Guide"
Taiwanese people half a century ago had no choice but to enter Taipei to seek a living
But half a century later, the people of Taiwan are yearning for the life in Taipei wholeheartedly.
In the past half century, have the people of Taiwan changed, or has Taipei changed?
Taiwan's new wave films in the 1980s provide us with a clue
<font color=#FFD500FF>Look at these houses, I can't tell them apart</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>It was designed by me, not by me, it looks the same</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>With me, without me, it seems less and less important</font>
In Edward Yang's "Childhood Sweetheart"
The heroine's architect colleagues lamented the changes in the cityscape of Taipei
The old streetscape is no longer visible
Instead, foreign advertising, multinational corporations, skyscrapers
Reflecting the period of the 1980s
It happens that Taiwan is catching up with the globalization of capitalism
The critical period when Taipei was built into an international city
In 1980, the first 7-11 store in Taiwan opened on Chang'an East Road, Taipei
In 1981, Taipei City began to develop the Xinyi Project Area
In 1984, Taiwan's first McDonald's opened on Minsheng East Road, Taipei
These changes all marked the beginning of Taipei's transition to a capitalist modern society
Taipei in the 1980s was like Paris in the 1850s
At that time Napoleon III hired Haussmann to transform Paris
Demolish the old community, build a new avenue on Tuokuan Road, and build an urban park
This is the first urban plan built with modern technology in human history
In order to promote the capitalist industrial and commercial economy and facilitate the government to control the social order
exactly in the 1850s
Paris Transformed into the First Capital of Modernity Stimulates Baudelaire's Literature
same
Taipei, which was transformed by modernization projects in the 1980s, also stimulated Taiwan's new wave cinema
Taipei, which was transformed by modernization projects in the 1980s, also stimulated Taiwan's new wave cinema
The most obvious embodiment is the large number of train elements in Hou Hsiao-hsien's films
But these trains are not moving at high speed without ever going back.
On the contrary, in "Love in the Wind and Dust"
We saw the Pingxi line train going to and from Taipei Main Station and Jiufen
Not a symbol of the rapidly developing modern society
Instead, it slowly shuttles back and forth between rural Taiwan and modern cities
commuting by train
Taiwanese can choose to distance themselves from modern Taipei
Even people who live in cities
I still use traditional media to write letters to communicate with my family
This highlights the subjectivity of Taiwanese in the 1980s:
Choose to keep a distance from the indifferent city of Taipei
At this time, people are still singing "Taipei is not my home"
by contrast
those who stayed in taipei
Just like Edward Yang's "The Terrorist" portrayed
The male protagonist is an office worker who has no ambitions in his career and is waiting for a promotion
The wife is a writer who is tired of the workplace and escapes to the world of fiction
In time, each character looks forward to future opportunities
Embracing the "success" hope of capitalist trafficking upward mobility
But spatially, each character is imprisoned in the city
Taipei is like a prison
In order not to be discovered, the promise of time is exchanged for the restraint of space
But the "beautiful dream" promised by modernity and capitalism
At the end of the movie, it turned into a "nightmare" for Taipei people
The actor didn't get promoted in the end, and his wife ran away with someone else
In the end, there was a dream where the hero killed someone
And the whole thing started because of a prank call from a stranger
but the movie left a foreshadowing
Did not disclose: Who is this dreaming?
Who is the real terrorist?
This foreshadowing is like a collective dream of those who went to Taipei to work hard
Predicted Taipei in the 1990s
Deceived into Taipei by the dream promised by economic progress, only to be let down and abandoned after entering Taipei
As a result, some people became "terrorists"
The 1992 Taipei McDonald's bombing
Bai Xiaoyan's murder in 1997
More and more urban cases are the result of Taipei's involvement in modernity and capitalism
On the one hand, modern cities provide new technology and a clustered environment
Make contact with strangers easier
At the same time, capitalism widens the gap between the rich and the poor and instills in people the mindset that money is paramount
And the result of 20 years of urbanization in Taipei
It is the demolition of many old buildings, the rise of housing prices, the financialization of real estate
The price paid for urbanization
The most obvious performance is in Cai Mingliang's "Long Live Love"
As the heroine of the house agent, I come into contact with empty houses one by one every day
But in the empty room a real family never lived
The male protagonist sets up a street stall and wanders wolves everywhere, sleeping in a rented house every day
The job of the second male lead is to sell spiritual bone towers
Selling a house to a dead person but not being able to buy a house as a living person
Through the interpretation of these three roles
"Long Live Love" reflects the feelings of Taipei people in the 1990s
Obviously at home (house), but not at home (home)
Obviously there are many homes in Taipei, but there is no real home
In the film's final scene, the heroine cries for five minutes in a park
But why is she crying? And why are you crying in the park?
This park is the newly opened Daan Forest Park in 1994.
It was originally Jianhua New Village, a military dependent village of the Air Force
Once preserved thousands of residents' memories of military dependents' villages
Urbanization has demolished the memories of Taipei people
But it has never been seen by people in Taipei
The crying of the heroine makes the unseen tears visible
She shed more than just tears of feeling the emptiness of love
Also the tears of Taipei people
In the films of Edward Yang, Lou Xiaoxian, and Tsai Mingliang
What kind of city did we see in Taipei in the 1980s and 1990s?
It is the modern life that must keep distance
It is the alienated social relationship between people
It is the psychological price paid by Taipei people for urbanization
These are what the philosopher Marshall Berman calls "the experience of modernity"
Since the Industrial Revolution, Europeans have continued to transform their urban environments through new technologies
Promise that this leads to a progressive life
But when the living environment keeps changing
The life that people used to be familiar with will suddenly lose their focus
So modernity is a contradictory life experience
On the one hand, technological progress and capitalism promise that people will always have new possibilities for tomorrow.
But in this ever-changing world
while destroying everything we've ever known
Neighborhoods and streets where I lived as a child
Beliefs and values ​​that have been defended
could be eliminated overnight.
All solid things melt away
This is the price of pursuing modern life
So Taipei movies in the 80s and 90s
The atmosphere is always melancholic, the rhythm is slow, and the feeling of being imprisoned in the city
Literary theorist Fredric Jameson thinks
in these movies
The city of Taipei is clearly prosperous, but the characters are always limited to small places
In fact, it reflects Taiwan's entry into the global capitalist system
It is no longer a third world country
But because of political factors, there is no way to have a place in the international arena
Can only be marginalized on a small island
Just like the lonely men and women in the city of Taipei in the new wave movies
But this situation began to change after 2000
Taipei began to find its own position
Attempt to seek international recognition by comparing with foreign countries
In Cai Mingliang's "What Time Are You Over There"
The male protagonist selling watches on the overpass of Taipei Main Station
Met only once with the heroine who was going to Paris
But let the hero start to be inexplicably fascinated by everything in France
Fall in love with French director Truffaut's film Four Hundred Blows
Set all clocks in Taipei to Paris time
Let yourself live like the French
Reflecting Taipei's desire to become Paris
in the movie
You don't see the build shots that you would normally utilize when transforming a space-time scene
It seems that the distance between Taipei and Paris lies only in the switching of one camera
But what was the result of trying to catch up with the West?
on the other side of the earth
heroine in paris leads an aimless life
I feel that the water and soil do not match everywhere, and I can't blend in
The only one to rely on is a Hongkonger
it's here
Paris is no longer a symbol of progress, but the first target of critiques of modernity
Blindly chasing after the West all the way, the end result is the death of culture
Like the end of a movie, luggage floating on water, lost its roots
After the filming of "What Time Are You Over There"
The prophecy of modernity in Tsai Ming-liang's films has come true
The Taipei City Government demolished the Taipei Railway Station flyover for "landscaping" and built a Taipei underground street
Taipei is pulling out its own roots, forgetting the collective memory of Taipei people's past
2002
There are two things that make Taipei officially "enter the world"
Taipei 101 opens, becoming world's tallest skyscraper
The movie "Double Eyes" was released, which was the first time in the history of Taiwan's film industry that Columbia, an American company, invested
Multinational Teamwork Shooting
The story of "Double Eyes" itself revolves around Taiwan's problems with Western modernity.
Taiwan police seek help from US FBI
Trying to solve a religious serial killing case
but this case
But even FBI agents who represent Western scientific rationality cannot explain
<font color=#FFD500FF>Why do they see hallucinations differently? </font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>Yes, why? </font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>Could the murderer be able to control their hallucinations? </font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>To be honest, we don't know</font>
In the end, the FBI agent even became the fifth victim himself.
Originally the work of modern science was to remove the ignorance of religion
But this "non-believers in ghosts and gods" has instead become a religious sacrifice
But why would a cult exist in Taipei and make Taipei haunted?
It turns out that the head of this organization is the founder of a technology company who returned from studying in the United States
The headquarters of the organization is also located in the most modern landmark building in Taipei: World Trade Center
Here, we see the problems of Taiwan after learning from Western modernization
Western scientific knowledge brought progress but eradicated traditional values, religious beliefs
Instead, lonely modern people can't find their home and lose the meaning of life
It was this environment that gave rise to various folk religions
Even though Taipei's exterior has been transformed into a modern form
But in my heart I still yearn for a certain traditional belief as my destination
Looking at Taipei from an external perspective, it is an international modern capital
But in the unknown depths of Taipei, there is still a traditional temple hidden
It seems that no matter how much Taiwan pursues Western modernization
There will always be a lingering "ghost" haunting Taipei
Because people in the city still believe in the gods of the past
Taipei has thus become a haunted city
And more modernity can't remove the specter
Because this specter is a product of modernity
Is it possible to escape this haunted city?
<font color=#FFD500FF>I fuck you</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>I fuck you Taipei</font>
In Cape Seven
The hero who escaped from Taipei and came to Hengchun
Instead, another ghost of history was encountered:
A love interrupted by the end of the Japanese colonial era
Seven Love Letters Preserved 60 Years Ago and Not Delivered to Taiwanese
These love letters from Japan drive the whole plot forward
The actor must let Taiwan today hear the voice of Japan 60 years ago
And this voice happened to be after leaving Taipei, a symbol of modernity.
pre-modern Taiwan that can only be heard
We have seen that Taipei movies after 2000
Constantly referring to highly modernized countries to help position itself
But at the same time, Taipei in these movies
But full of loss and confusion because of modernization
This is like the reason why British Gothic literature emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries
It is because after the industrial revolution, urbanization caused a large number of workers to become unemployed and overworked.
Those wounded souls linger in the city, haunting the people in the future
by contrast
It is precisely after leaving the urbanized Taipei that Cape No. 7 has a new vitality.
Opening up a glimmer of life for the box office of domestic films
After 2009, we see a third turn in Taipei cinema
<font color=#FFD500FF>Paris is the world of love</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>Without you, Taipei is so lonely</font>
In "One Page of Taipei"
Actor who struggled to learn French is broken up by his girlfriend who lives in Paris
Desire to fly to Paris to save his girlfriend
However, he encountered an accident during the journey and was forced to flee
On the contrary, it gave me the opportunity to see the public life in Taipei
Park gymnastics, night market culture
Taipei is no longer full of ghosts and death like "Double Eyes"
It is no longer like "What Time Are You Over There", chasing after Western modernity
<font color=#FFD500FF>I don't understand why you are in such a hurry</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>Didn't you say she was waiting for you there?</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>Actually, she didn't even know that I was going there</font>
Instead, I began to see my own urban culture and pursue self-affirmation
<font color=#FFD500FF>I have been waiting for so long anyway</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>The worst thing is to stay here</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>I think staying here is not bad</font>
The heroine's dialogue implies:
Taipei doesn't have to be a replica of Paris
So although the title of the movie is Au Revoir Taipei in French, it means goodbye to Taipei.
but in the ending
The protagonist did not say goodbye to Taipei, but decided to stay in Taipei
That's why the Chinese title is One Page Taipei, not One Night Taipei
Because a "page" of Taipei symbolizes that there is a "person" left under the roof of Taipei
Taipei films during this period no longer blindly yearn for the West
Instead, start to help local and local cultures create a positive image
At the same time, it also re-"historicizes" Taipei through movies.
In Yang Yazhe's "Girlfriend. Boyfriend
We saw three different eras of Taipei from the 1990s to 2012
But unlike Taipei in past movies
The protagonist is always imprisoned in the city, feels the indifference of the city, and longs to escape from Taipei
The protagonist of "Girlfriend Boyfriend" is to introduce the rebellious culture of Kaohsiung's student days into Taipei
In turn, use the public space of the city to create its own history
People began to take the initiative to change Taipei, instead of being changed by Taipei
<font color=#FFD500FF>You sleep first, wake up, Taiwan will be different</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>We will all be free</font>
it's here
We see what sociologist Richard Sennett calls the "open city"
The original urban design originated in the 19th century
In order to facilitate commodity circulation, government rule, and public health
Build a metropolitan area with technology, enterprises, and high-rise buildings from top to bottom
But the city is not its own master, not a closed system
because when the city grows
When introducing people of different genders, classes, beliefs
It will bring new mass creativity and change a city from the bottom up
It is because cities create public spaces, parks, avenues
Only then did the student movement and social movement become possible
In "The Magician on the Overpass", which reproduces the Taipei Zhonghua Mall in the 1980s
Yang Yazhe goes a step further to reinterpret the cultural loss brought about by the urbanization of Taipei
The style no longer mourns the loss like Taiwanese movies in the 80s
It's about facing loss in a new way, allowing the magician to bring back what has disappeared
Toys I Loved But Disappeared
Families Disappeared Because of Political Violence
The Son Who Disappeared Because of Gender Violence
The love that disappeared due to military duty
The family relationship that has disappeared due to the alienation of the parent-child relationship
How can I bring these lost things back?
In the final episode, the magician reveals:
Movie world is the 99th floor
The male protagonist travels through time and space to enter the movie world of "Love in the Wind and Dust"
It's like the audience traveled back in time and space to the 1980s through "The Magician on the Bridge"
Bring back what was lost and let everyone remember it forever
<font color=#FFD500FF>Because it's missing</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>You will remember, it used to be yours</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>The original disappearance is the real existence</font>
<font color=#FFD500FF>here</font>
We see what Freud called the great cultural achievements of mankind
It is to use symbolic substitutes to satisfy the missing link in reality
When children see their parents disappear, they invent all kinds of games
to re-enact "disappearing", but with the difference that
In the game world, children can take the initiative to make things disappear again
'The Magician on the Runover' Is Like Child's Play
Bring back the things that happened in Taipei but disappeared on the screen
The trauma of modernity suffered by Taipei has the possibility of being healed
Because what disappears can exist in another way
Looking back on the past half century of Taipei film history
We immediately notice that all productions are made by male directors
It's actually a man's point of view.
But "Taipei Women's Guide" broke this situation
What exactly is Taipei that women see when they set off, and how is it different from men?
at this point
"Taipei Women's Illustrated Book" inherited the 1964 "Early Train from Taipei"
From the perspective of female subjects
But at the same time, the appearance of Taipei women has been updated
Unlike the heroine of "Taipei's Morning Train", the entire trajectory of life is determined by men
He went to Taipei to work hard for his father, was raped by a male boss, and lost his boyfriend in the end
The whole film depicts the tragedy of urban women
But the heroine of "Taipei Women's Illustrated Book" no longer defines herself by her relationship with men
Instead, for their own desires, they constantly refuse to continue their relationship with men
Refuse to be a boss lady, refuse to be a control freak, refuse to marry into a wealthy family, refuse to be a soul mate
In these choices, the subjectivity of women is just presented as a kind of negativity
in ancient greek mythology
Medusa said no to men who were seduced by him and petrified all men who saw him
in greek tragedy
Antigone says no to the king's law and insists on burying her brother illegally
In these examples we all see the insight of psychoanalysis
The quality of "female" is to be able to say no to "masculine"
The whole human civilization is patriarchal
Precisely because the male cannot face the eternal negation of the female
And you have to pretend you're the one with the power
Therefore, Western philosophy started from Aristotle to regard women as the lack of men
A woman is less than a man because she lacks what a man has
Until the Middle Ages, Europeans believed that women were actually men with damaged penises
But in "Taipei Women's Illustrated Book", men are the lack of women
men lack respect for women
Men want to inherit the family and lose their freedom
Men have no desire to have children
In the MV of Ding Dong and Bai An, we can see the display of female subjectivity more clearly
In the title of the song "just right", there is a "woman" hiding
Because it is this woman who defines what kind of relationship is best for her
And in Ding Dang's "Female Character", it is more clearly sung
"I am me / I am not someone next to the female character"
When Taipei women feel that "I am always a stranger in the eyes of Taipei people"
Trapped in modern urban life and unable to find a home
Sisterhood is their home
Which brings us back to the heart of Taipei cinema:
over the past half century
Taiwanese who blindly pursue modernization and fight for the economy
Make Taipei a place that doesn't feel like home
Even people from Taipei still feel that "Taipei is not my home"
Obviously people built the city of Taipei
Why do I feel homeless in a familiar place?
Philosopher Heidegger thinks
The biggest difference between humans and animals
Even when a person is "home", it doesn't feel like home
Because a home is not just a house to live in (Haus)
It refers to the hometown where people pursue the meaning of existence (Heimat)
It is precisely because people have the feeling of "although they are at home, but they are homeless"
Talented people will strive to pursue "going home" and are willing to work hard in this world
In German, homeless (Unheimlichkeit) also means eerie
This explains why Cape Seven's previous Taipei films always had a dull, dark feel
Because at that time Taiwanese were in a situation where they had no home in the world.
A modern stage where you don’t feel at home even at home
So the question facing Taiwanese is: How do we go home?
Heidegger's answer is that man finds his home in works of art
The ancient Greeks realized
People often feel homeless when they are alive, and they cannot find the meaning of their existence
But a work of art can reveal a world of meaning
when the ancient greeks built the parthenon
The sky they see starts to look "very Greek"
At this time, the existence of artworks allows people to establish a new relationship with the world
Therefore, the bounden duty of an artist is to "return home", constantly going back and forth between home and the world
Let the homeless modern people find their way home
So the history of Taipei cinema in the past 60 years is like a history that brings Taiwanese back home
People can re-examine the urban indifference and cultural loss brought about by modernity
And the dreams and nightmares, alienation and alienation brought about by capitalism
until one day people can start to feel
Taipei can be my home
