the world's largest program use of the editor vscode software plus the world's largest code And the chat that is being taken inside is clearly running towards the AI ​​level on this road So at that time, everyone's reaction to the scientific community was that you didn't do it wrong, right? You have to directly review the software's vscode and then do the same thing as the software planning I also want to grab a client with him. Good luck. In addition to the ultimate boss, there is also a circle of small boss around the end of the micro soft It's a hundred million dollars of augmented code magic. It's all capital. It's a full-fledged ice wall Kersel's initial team is simply a small approach. This ratio is completely small. How did this game that looks like a defeat start This story is even more interesting. Kersel's team is actually two earlier small teams of small companies. What does the first team want to do A super private encrypted chat software is so private that not only do you send content encrypted, but also when you send it to someone all have to be hidden with the same type of encrypted at the time of their friend Ben heard this idea the first reaction is your client is who Alibaba you see the smart people at the beginning of the idea may not look for the editor of another team they go further they see the potential of AI want to do a daddy field of the class pilot, which is to help the engineer automatically generate three models of this idea sounds more reliable, AI can not a specific How good is the story of the hammer field, but soon they hit the south wall and it was the first wall on both sides of the wall is the data they found that they could not get enough CAD model data to train AI model effect poor difference on the second wall is the most fatal is the limit of the plug they want to be at the auto desk home of the custom 360 software to do a plug-in result they found this software api to the home you can not even do a simple keyboard monitor what is the concept of this is that you can not achieve like the kopeck you a keyboard code suggestion on the keyboard you can only put a button on the screen to let the user click on the button to let the user click on the button一条电盘代码建议就b o一下自己冒出来 你只能在屏幕上放一个笨组的按钮 让优惠点一下 to be able to put the code this experience is not ah or you have to go to the autumn to say the big brain can not open an API interface for us you guess people will care about you? It is this time in the field of tragedy and pain failure of the CID that they can not understand a core truth if you want to create a real real sense of magic AI experience you can not be a difference under the person you must have the whole house this look crazy decision Directly copy the VS code is exactly what they learned from failure The most precious moment Although this makes them stand on the opposite side of the giant But also gave them the highest authority to modify the entire house They have the whole house But there were two families living in the house Do you remember the two small teams we mentioned earlier One is from CD projects Michael who broke down the stage and A and they thought very directly, but on the other team of the rich Visco, it is the want to do encrypted chat of rv and swarov, they also turn to the code field, but the idea is not the same, want to do a more elite more customized tool, a little like the programmer's bubble in the middle of the end, then a more crazy idea, but the people of these two groups a combination Say how about we get together This time, the friends who saw it next to it were angry Oscar jumped out again Don't don't His reason is simple and rough And it's completely in line with the golden shell rule of the turtle The first is to bring the horse Honghai don't go They went to the second merger There are too many founders The internal must fight Close the fire They are back again 可以说 可是这家公司几乎是踩着所有创业闭坑指南的雷区诞生的所有人都觉得他们要玩 但他们就这么干了 那他们为什么敢这么干 因为他们看到了别人没看到的东西当时的ai变成江湖主要有三大门派 第一派我叫他练单派 代表就是像铺了塞的magic这些明星公司他们的想法是 我们得训练自己的专属大模型怎么练 去跟大企业合作 用他们内部的代码库来投为 听起来很高端 对吧 但问题是这太慢了 第二派 插件派代表是co dm这些公司 他们的逻辑是bscode这么普及 我们就在上面做个插件 用户装一下就能用 多方便这不就是co sr团队自己在cd上踩过的大坑吗 既仁离下永远不可能有极致的体验 然后就是第三派 也是最孤独的一派 推导重建派整个硅谷就他们一家co sr他们的赌注是ai必须和编辑器深度融合 融为一体 想要真正的魔法就必须重写底层的交互逻辑 你看真正重要的地方在哪 10 years later, what will the world become? How does AI write the belt? In fact, everyone thinks the same way. The founder of the net police in the 90s wanted to do the paper's founder to sell the company to do instagram. The idea is not cow cow, but the real decision is not the life after 10 years of prediction but you are the judgment of the future 12 months of the product roadmap for a business company to say look at the future 10 years as well as do the future three seasons because you have to live you need to get the results in a short period of time to get the user's approval to form a upward trend you have no trend you do not have everything talent will go investment will run the market will forget you one to two gold singer chose this most difficult and lonely also need the shortest way to power that the first fire in the end is how to light up you may think they are different today's big move a can help you automatically write the entire project of super ai wrong on the contrary, they do the first thing extremely simple simple to even a little anti ai they found a start-up company is the easiest to look at the most fatal pit a function is not the stronger the better what is good is to make the user feel the value of the fastest speed function let's do a comparison is a super intelligent ai special agent you tell him to help me to rebuild this project into a react he can do very powerful but you need to spend time to learn how to communicate with him how to give him instructions in case you do it wrong and have to do it again on the other hand is a simple code to fill the function you are in vs code you knock code no you change the color you just knocked two letters b oh one a whole line of code directly to help you to repair which experience is more cool must be the latter because it brings value is the early brain zero learning cost you from vscode to switch over the second immediately feel the cool this cool is their first fire is the original fire is the first fire is the original four can only make the user cool they themselves are their own product's number one user the whole company's engineers every day is to write with scientific code where is not easy to use which function response slow do not need to product experience to raise demand they themselves are the first to sell the two people this model makes the whole company become a extremely flat extremely industrial thought center organization new employees joined the department of what our product route is what I should do what the answer is the route you use yourself is not to have an idea? If you have an idea, go to the AI industry everyone is the first time to come to the route said for a long time the body of the department is a set of vf The brain is full of those giant model suppliers open AI and drop it google What is the success of the technology? It is the insight into the human heart of the programmers. You see, a common misunderstanding is that the programmers love to write codes The programmers love the pleasure of solving problems is the kind of complex calculation after the homework of a complex algorithm But they hate those garbage in the code For example, handling an inexplicable react bug Or turn over the text for a long time To solve a broken reliance problem This is completely the opposite of other industries You go to a top lawyer Hey, I have an AI that can help you write legal documents You don't have to write it anymore Guess what he'll say He'll think you're insulting his profession is to take away his soul of work because writing itself is his proud craft but you tell the programmer brother, I can help you to automatically deal with those mortals he will say hurry up this is the key to success they did not try to replace the programmer they did is to do all the let the programmer painless physical work dirty work, this is not all programmer this group there is a unique feature they are born to be a virus spread of the hot bed they sit together will look at each other on the other screen with what tools a good insert a cool theme a boat when ten boat this kind of face-to-face effect is a good sales team that can not be compared to any price this is the composition of KES's unique product leading growth model a nearly impossible to be reproduced in other fields of growth When it comes to solving these specific problems in the The whole skeleton is in a state of madness about AGI The whole industry is full of madness You can't even ask a question in peace How big is this AGI and how much does it affect As long as you ask, you are a kind of you are not good at it, and the concept of blackmail is exactly the opposite of this madness. They don't care about the remote, the blur, and even the scary AGI They only care about one thing, AI is a tool, a tool used to solve specific problems, not very real, very rare, just as tool itself began to evolve at a speed of index level, you this set of practical philosophy can still follow up on the problem is not just to say that the science is directly to all the AI application companies of the fate of the door because AI evolution is not just as simple as becoming smart, it is more like a appetite infinite giant beast every day in the swallowing of the sky text number of computing power and power, which leads to a more profound contradiction on the one hand But this company desperately wants to make AI experience more practical, cheaper, more Sample Complexity说白了就是笨人类小孩看一两次猫就知道什么是猫了现在的AI呢你得喂给他几百万张图他才能勉强分清写代码也一样人类高手看一两个例子就能举一反三AI可能需要成千上万个范例才能学会最新的模型像GPD4在这个指标上跟人类比依然是天壤识别第二叫美瓦智能Intelligence Povat简单说就是耗电能耗的功耗大概是20瓦跟个小灯泡差不多AI呢一次复杂的查询据说要消耗掉 several liters of water to cool down the efficiency of the difference in how many numbers so you see the current ai is strong but he is a big black out of the strong rely on the sea volume of the energy of the sea volume of the intelligence with full force out of the this brings a huge gap optimistic派 said do not panic technical problems to teach the technical solution you see that because of the answer to the yellow it will continue to launch better chips to reduce the cost of the pessimistic or say the reality of the cold water directly break the dream hardware physical limit is coming soon because of his latest b200 chip open to see is not put two pieces of the previous generation of h100 chip together We have cut the calculation speed from 32 to 4 for the sake of saving power It's useless if you cut it down again Like the last point of the blow-dry is about to be blown dry What's more important is that there is not enough power You see the data center is as fast as the big screen But you see the nuclear power station has to take years Europe and the United States have not been serious about the energy base for decades This short board is stuck on everyone's neck This argument is the most acceptable for a company like可是 It's the big motorist who's hanging on the top They've got all the treasures on the road to AI toolization But if the fuel of the driving tool That is, the cost of the large model is not reduced Even because of the energy crisis Then their whole business model won't go bankrupt 所以真正的破局点可能根本不在硬件上而在一个更根本的地方我们能不能创造出一种更聪明的算法一种不需要靠满力而是更接近人脑工作方式的ai一种每单位算力能产生更多智能的ai这才是真正的胜贼当所有人都还在为电力和芯片炒得不可开交时一些更聪明的脑袋已经开始在这条 心路上狂奔了 而这条路又会把克斯尔带向何方那这个更聪明的算法在哪 到底长啥样 别急答案还是要回到我们上面说的人脑上咱们来做个算术题 人脑到底等于多少算力有人估算过 大概在1-10个pidaflops之间这个数字其实跟因为他最新的b200芯片在同一个数量级上听起来 好像我们已经被追上了 对吧但别忘了最要命的一点 功耗咱们的大脑功耗多少20瓦 一个昏暗的小蒸泡 B200 1000W is not a heat-sensitive air conditioner It's 50 times worse than this Why? What magic does the human brain's nerve source use? First of all, it uses a low voltage strategy We all know that the frequency and voltage of the square-pointed is also more of a trick called the habit of what it means is that our brain is not every hour every moment in the power of the whole open his most of the nerve are resting only when needed to force the use of the precise activation of this is like a super efficient compression algorithm with the least energy to pass the most information you see this put the AI face two big mountains 清清楚楚的摆在了我们面前 第一座山叫美瓦智能 也就是能效比 对 看起来像个工程问题 也许我们能解决怎么解决 换材料不用归了 用新的晶体管现在已经有公司在朝这个方向猛攻了 虽然很难 但至少我们能看到一条模糊的路 但第二座山才是真正的绝望之山 他叫样本复杂度 也就是我们前面说的ai太笨了 Learn things too slowly this problem it is not a engineering problem it is a pure algorithm black box our brain in the end hidden a what kind of amazing natural learning algorithm no one knows that is 35 billion years The result of random search and evolution you can not rely on the engineer to calculate to re-enact it you even even the problem is what are not clear Just like a game you were thrown in but no one told you what the rules were what the goal was what you were playing you couldn't even sell the first step which went back to the most fundamental analysis when everyone thought AI was a tool that could be constantly optimized They admitted that we were the one who was holding the axe and as long as we could grind the axe more powerful, we would be fine but the complexity of the sample told you this question We may not even know what the number is We don't even know if what we hold in our hands is a axe This kind of bottom-level mystery also made the AI circle start a more profound soul-controversy What is AI? Is it a tool, a partner or a brand new object? This will completely split the AI circle into two halves One side is the AGI side that looks up at the starry sky They believe that code is the first piece of Once the Dominoes card is pushed, AI will self-defeat and run all the way until it becomes the invincible new species On the other hand, it is the tool sect that steps on the ground. They think don't go so far. AI is a better hammer. Since it is a hammer, it is necessary to consider how to sell it and how to make money when the AGI party is still entangled in whether AI will produce self-awareness when the tool party is thinking about what crazy business model in your editor to price ranking database company directly in your code tool in order to become your default option hit the head of the blood flow of the brain opened how big but you think carefully this is not the reverse of the Google ad a invisible tax you spend on the Google every penny there is a part of the silent flow of Google advertising system but you do not feel this is the most powerful place to distribute the cost to all people let everyone feel no pain but add up to a business status this extreme business thinking and that of the philosophy of the infinite intelligence The change is simply a collision of ice and fire. Which side does that They also made their own models but the purpose is not to rush to a GI, on the contrary, it is for a very simple reason fast they found that at that time the market All the ai became assistants are too slow to ask a question he poked poked think for a long time that waiting process is enough to destroy a programmer most precious So they tried their best to optimize it to make the AI's response speed fast enough that you can't feel its existence, just like the air you need when you need it This is the typical tool-type thinking I don't care how smart AI is in the future I just care about whether it's good or not now this kind of material even to the point of no belief 他们根本不信有什么终极的产品形态 今天用a的好用 那就把ide做到极致 明天要是用户觉得在命令行里敲自然语言更爽 那就去把命令行做到极致 做产品的人就应该随时准备搁自己的命 这种灵活 这种对用户体验的片子才能让我们避开了那个关于a gi的宏大陷阱 那个听起来最性感的陷阱 ai写代码 ai自己测试 ai自己改进无限循环 最终有限出通用人工智能 听起来是不是很完美 但现实是这个所谓的自我进化循环根本跑不起来 because in many cases, AI can't even sell the first step of the code he generated, even the most basic test can't pass the score 40 in a reward-free environment you how to let him learn and improve like a student every time the test to teach white paper you expect him to sum up the crisis points you must first hand-in-hand teach him to give him a small photo to let him at least a few Now many big companies are doing this to strengthen their learning. This is not self-improvement. This is cheating. The real intelligence is not in a closed factory It's based on the brush. But to us, this real, complicated, chaotic world There is a profound understanding and standard And this is exactly what AI lacks most. But does AI really understand this world? The answer to this question may be hidden in our DNA, all of our human DNA is compressed into a few hundred thousand a cat with us 92 percent of the same a black star is 98% higher than that decision we become the core code of the spirit of everything that point dead also a few tens of thousands of thousands of original code is created a brain that can learn micro points can make rocket and our current large model it moves hundreds of G training data to smash into the result it still needs to rely on Strengthen learning this tube can force to go a little bit more stable This is the most intense battle in the AI circle Strengthen learning RL is the god's medicine or poison The opposite view is simple and rough RL is a garbage It's a bunch of people who have no way to go Will use the bad technology Why Because he himself doesn't know what this world looks like he must step on a huge solid model that has been built by the unsupervised study to play a role to be honest is to use the large model of the science to cover the strength of the study of the material Turing Award winner Ian Leccan has a special image of the metaphor ai this cake unsupervised study is cake It's the main subject, the supervisor is the cream on top, and the強化學習 is the cherry on top of the cake as a decoration His role is to make the last micro-tip to tell the model hey human like this do not like that he is very important but it is absolutely not the cake itself but the support派 immediately jumped out you all made a mistake the problem is not at all The problem is that we are too bad. We can't play with it we now all the algorithm is inherited from a called the old thought of the old he only good at solving those smooth continuous problems but the real world is not the real world is the cruel battlefield of zero or one or you were eaten by the lion or you live down or you double-edged success or you fail here is no middle ground Our algorithm, when it comes to this kind of continuous, broken-tongue-like difficulty, immediately gets stuck, so RL is not a problem He is exactly the one who brought the cruelness of the real world to us, forcing us to admit that our existing math tools have come to an end How does the real intelligence solve this problem The answer is back to biology A little deer can run when it is born A squirrel is separated from its mother Know how to bury the alley This is the appearance of the self-sufficiency system Is written in the instinct in the DNA This part is that cake That huge No need to learn the knowledge of the fast learning and so the real breakthrough point is not to answer the real question is to answer a more fundamental question when the brain this algorithm is running a baby to start solving those complex problems you see we went around a circle from the complex software code all the way to the side and finally found that we face is no longer a project problem It's not even a scientific problem It became a philosophical problem We built a human brain But in the end, we had to turn around To face the most mysterious black box in our own minds This may be the AI revolution Bring us the least unexpected gift Go back to the base and have a look Thank you
