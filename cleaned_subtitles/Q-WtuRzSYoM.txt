hi everybody welcome to this highlight episode of the podcast in Good Company what we've decided to do is for people who are really in a hurry we're going to clip down the episode to just be 10 minute long but probably what you'll see when you heard 10 minutes you're going to want to hear the whole thing now what we do Wednesday full episode Fridays the short episode tune in hi everyone I'm thrilled to be here with Yen stoltenberg who just finished off uh as the Secretary General in NATO and before NATO he was the Prime Minister of Norway warm welcome y thank you so much for having me so I'm having here um you know a book which uh you wrote uh which came out 8 years ago which basically covered the period until 10 years ago and it's got a beautiful picture of you on the on the front here um but just what are the what are the most important changes in the world since that book came out the most important changes at least related to my task my my responsibilities in NATO is that uh the world has become more dangerous the good that's the bad news the good news is that NATO has become stronger to protect close to 1 billion people um um of course there are many other changes but but but seen from a security perspective we have now a fullscale war in Europe uh we have uh a new very devastating conflict in the Middle East risk of escalation and we have significantly more Global rivalry between great Powers United States China um uh and then we have cyber hybrid terrorist threats as a constant threat to our security so so fundamentally we live in a more unpredictable more uh uh dangerous world and we have done for decades if we um cover some of these points here so how do you think the Ukraine situation will end what's the most likely Wars are by Nature extremely unpredictable unpredictable so therefore I will be very careful predicting how that will end um but um um of course we all want this war to end the challenge is that uh the quickest way to end the war is to lose a war uh but that will not lead to peace that will lead to occupation of Ukraine and Ukraine will not be a sovereign independent Democratic nation in Europe and anymore it will be a country controlled by by Moscow so if you want the war to end in a way where millions of ukrainians still can live in a free Democratic Society then we need to convince President Putin that he will not win on the battlefield that he has to sit down and negotiate agree uh a solution where Ukraine uh can still be a sovereign uh Democratic Nation the fact that there are stronger and stronger links between the autocrats in the world what are the what are the implications for the Western world that we have to be uh together when we see that the autocrats are more and more aligned and then of course that's partly we meaning partly NATO allies so 32 Nations on the both sou Atlantic but also with other countries which at least don't to be don't want to be part of a kind of autocratic Alliance and again Ukraine is perhaps the the clearest example Russia is responsible for war aggression the main providers of weapons uh and and enablers of that war is north Korea uh Iran and China uh and uh and and this is not rhetoric this is this is really this is real and makes a difference on the battlefield and we also also see how Russia and China are exercising more together um also around Japan uh um uh and other parts of the world so so this is really Global picture that makes it even more important that of course Nat to allies stand together but also that we work with Partners all around the world including South Korea Japan and many other countries there are some voices that want the EU to play a more important part in defense policy what is your view on that my view is that if it's done in the right way it's very good if it's done in the wrong way it's very bad uh so what's the right way and the right way is that EU should do more and they and and they have started to step up uh when it comes to for instance strengthening the defense industry meaning overcoming the fragmentation of the European Defense uh industry uh um to increase defense spending uh and to and to in general strengthen European uh uh uh defenses meaning that that that will also strengthen NATO good space yeah you cover a lot of issues yeah well there are well so the world is so complex right it is it is what's going on in space from a Warfare point of view so first I think what we see is that is more and more weaponization of space and and what happens in space space matters more and more for what's going on on the earth that's obvious for communications GPS cyber and then of course targeting a lot of military operations in Ukraine are dependent on uh satellites in in in space and and any future conflict space uh will be important uh what we also then see is that again Russia and China are developing capabilities that can actually be used as offensive weapons uh and this is a dangerous uh uh um development in a way a bit related to that AI what are the issues surrounding that when it comes to Warfare some people uh in America say that we should build AI into everything we do into all the weapons all the cars everything right to beat the Chinese in this kind of fight what how do you see AI impact in Warfare I think what is obvious that AI has and will even more so in the future change nature of warfare uh perhaps as fundamental as Industrial Revolution did I think we see something similar now a fundamental shift where we don't fully understand but but but autonomous systems uh facial recognition um drones cyber attacks by using also AI is has the potential of changing Warfare so much that it's very hard to fully uh understand uh the full implications we have SE we have already seen it on the battlefield in uh Ukraine it's not the secret that some of the drones and the surveillance systems that NATO operates also uses AI uh to process information so this is a this has already started but we only seen the beginning of a fundamental change of the natural Warfare you ran this country um during the July attack uh the terror attacks that we had and you know through the Ukraine situation in NATO what are the how does one lead uh during these traumatic situations what's the key to story it's to remain calm in a way um and to and to make sure that you sleep uh uh uh because U it is important to be able to function uh so I've seen some people in crisis exhausting them themselves too early M how do you work with feelings I'm a bit strange there because when the crisis are acute i i i suppress them I just keep keep them away and and in one way I think that helps me dealing with feelings is it lonely it is lonely but but perhaps less lonely that's that people believe if there's anything I'm quite good at is to uh allow people to help me talking about um people just how you at NATO you've been dealing with um you know people who are perceived to have you know large uh egos I guess what's the key to reaching consensus with them and getting to agreement no I think it's about taking their concerns seriously and to even if we disagree on many issues we may they may Al actually also have relevant points and uh and concerns and uh without being too specific of course there have been a lot of attention of how did we manage four years of uh president Trump in the white house um and and and it's no no secret that I disagree with him on trade or abortion or or climate change but that is that was not core issues for NATO so what I focused on was what matters for NATO and actually on those issues we were had yeah a large degree of agreement his main message was that European allies had to invest more in events he conveyed that message in a way which was a bit say not as didn't use conver different than than many other political leaders but but the core of that message was something was absolutely the same as President Obama had done before him or President Biden does now uh and I took that concern seriously and I think that helped the same with with with President erogan people asked me how how does that work well he has expressed serious concerns about the fact that no other country NATO all country have suffered more terrorist attacks than than than turkey so take that seriously so I think focus on the issues uh uh that's the best way of uh uh addressing strong political leaders [Music]
