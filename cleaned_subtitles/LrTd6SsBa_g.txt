Just weeks before its bankruptcy, First Brands 
Group was being pitched to investors as a $6  
billion loan opportunity. Jefferies was marketing 
the deal. The company was said to have nearly  
$1 billion in cash. Then it imploded - 
proof, once again, that “due diligence”  
is sometimes just a phrase in a pitch deck.
Tricolor Holdings collapsed even faster. Tricolor  
operated as both a used car dealership and a 
subprime lender, offering high-interest loans to  
borrowers with limited or no credit history—many 
of them undocumented. It packaged those loans  
into AAA-rated securities and sold them to 
investors. When repayments faltered, the whole  
structure unraveled. Fifth Third Bank, one of its 
creditors, is accusing Tricolor of fraud, alleging  
that the company pledged the same collateral to 
multiple creditors. Investigators are now combing  
through what may be a corrupted loan database, 
and banks have begun repossessing vehicles  
from dealership lots across the Southwest.
The speed of these collapses caught investors  
off guard. Just months ago, First Brands’ debt 
was marked near par by private credit funds—some  
even marked above 100 cents on the dollar. 
Tricolor’s AAA-rated securities were trading  
at full value before the bankruptcy. Today, First 
Brands’ top-tier loans fetch just over 33 cents  
on the dollar and Tricolor’s lower-ranking 
bonds have plunged to 12 cents on the dollar.  
These weren’t supposed to be crazy investments. 
They sat in the portfolios of pension funds,  
insurers, and asset managers—institutions 
that aim to avoid volatility, not absorb it.
 
Kroll – a bond rating agency cut its 
bond rating on some Tricolor bonds from  
AAA - 19 levels to double C. According to 
Bloomberg - the rating agency wasn’t able  
to contact Tricolor and couldn’t confirm 
even basic facts about the business.
 
These defaults have exposed weaknesses in 
the credit markets, are leading investors to  
question lending standards, and the structure 
of private debt markets. They’ve also raised  
questions about how much risk is hiding 
in supposedly safe securities—and whether  
more surprises are waiting in the wings.
First Brands revealed a twelve-billion-dollar  
web of liabilities when it collapsed - and 
investigators are working to unveil whether  
the firm pledged the same assets to different 
lenders several times over – in order to  
borrow these huge sums of money. Jefferies - the 
investment bank, and Millennium Management – one  
of the biggest hedge funds in the world, 
are said to be amongst those facing losses.
 
Tricolor and First Brands operated in different 
corners of the auto sector. Tricolor sold used  
cars to subprime borrowers, many of 
whom were undocumented workers in the  
Southwestern United States. First Brands imported 
and distributed car parts—things like brake pads,  
spark plugs and windshield wipers—which were sold 
to major retailers like AutoZone and O’Reilly.
 
Both companies were privately owned and both 
relied heavily on debt. Tricolor – Like many  
dealerships, earned more from the loans it made 
to its customers than from the cars themselves.  
According to Bloomberg – they regularly 
charged interest rates above 20%. Those  
loans were bundled into asset-backed 
securities and sold-on to investors.  
First Brands was built up through acquisitions 
– which were financed by borrowing. Its owner,  
Patrick James, expanded the company by stitching 
together smaller manufacturers - he then  
layered on further leverage by borrowing 
against invoices and inventory—tapping  
private credit funds and specialist lenders.
Their business models weren’t inherently flawed.  
Tricolor served a niche market with limited access 
to traditional credit. First Brands built scale  
through acquisitions and supply chain finance. 
But each was exposed to pressures that have  
intensified in recent years: immigration 
enforcement, rising tariffs, inflation,  
and a consumer base stretched by higher 
interest rates and elevated vehicle costs.
 
AutoZone and O’Reilly autoparts – two customers 
of First Brands - have continued to report strong  
earnings. This makes First Brands’ collapse 
even more striking. The problem wasn’t demand—it  
was the structure of the company’s financing.
CarMax, the country’s largest used car retailer,  
missed earnings expectations by more than 37% 
last week, sending its stock to a five-year low.  
Unit sales fell sharply, and management 
described the quarter as “challenging,” citing  
weaker consumer demand and pricing missteps. 
Carmax caters to middle-income buyers. If this  
group are cutting their spending, it might be a 
sign that broader spending is under pressure.

The US consumer economy appears to be splitting 
– we discussed this idea recently in my video on  
the great Mortgage divide. Wealthier American 
households are feeling quite rich, many bought  
homes before the pandemic with low-interest rate 
loans and house prices are now up significantly.  
This group are also up on their investments – with 
the stock market sitting near all-time highs. 
 
Poorer households – on the other hand - are 
falling behind. Inflation – which refuses  
to go away - has pushed up the cost of 
everyday essentials. Interest rates on  
poorer Americans loans are high and things 
like used car prices, though off their peak,  
are still high relative to pre-pandemic levels.
Other expenses like insurance premiums and  
car maintenance costs – which make up a larger 
percentage of low-income Americans spending - have  
outpaced headline inflation too. 
While prime auto loans seem fine – at  
present – according to Fitch - 6.6% of subprime 
auto loans are at least 60 days past due – this  
is the highest level seen - since the agency began 
collecting data on them. Credit card defaults and  
student loan defaults have risen sharply too.
Tricolor’s collapse reflects some of this  
pressure. The company specialized in lending 
to borrowers with limited access to traditional  
credit—many were undocumented workers who live 
paycheck to paycheck. Some analysts have pointed  
to immigration enforcement as a contributing 
factor. Deportation fears and labor force exits  
may have disrupted repayment patterns, though 
the extent of the impact remains unclear.
 
First Brands was exposed to a similar consumer 
base, but indirectly. Its parts were sold through  
retailers that cater to budget-conscious drivers. 
AutoZone and O’Reilly have reported strong  
earnings, suggesting auto part demand remains 
intact. The problem in this case may not have  
been the customer base— it appears instead to 
have been the capital structure of the business.  
First Brands had borrowed heavily to fund 
acquisitions, then borrowed again against invoices  
and inventory. Rising tariffs added further 
strain to their business model, increasing costs  
on imported components and squeezing margins. 
There are other signs of general weaknesses in  
the business sector too. Sales of semi-trucks 
– which can indicate to investors how busy  
businesses expect to be in the coming months 
and years - have fallen 24% since May 2023,  
to the lowest level seen in five years. Medium 
duty truck sales are down almost 30% too.  
 
Labor market data adds another layer of 
uncertainty. ADP’s private payroll report  
showed a loss of 32,000 jobs in the most 
recent period. Now this number may not be  
accurate – but it is all we have right now as 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics has paused its  
reporting due to the US government shutdown. 
Unemployment affects credit markets both as a  
leading indicator and as a trigger – as obviously 
- when jobs disappear, repayment risk rises.
 
This all comes at a time when the reward for 
taking risk in markets has collapsed. The  
spread between yields on corporate bonds and the 
equivalent expiration treasury bonds has fallen to  
its lowest level since 2007. The Economist pointed 
out this week that junk bonds are now offering  
spreads of just 2.8 percent – which is well below 
the 4.5-percent average of the last twenty years.
 
The collapse of these companies 
has drawn attention to the near  
two trillion-dollar private credit market 
that has fueled Wall Street’s recent boom.
 
The short seller Jim Chanos who earned his 
reputation from exposing fraud at Enron in  
the late 1990’s – a firm that used off-balance 
sheet financing to hide substantial losses - told  
the Financial Times yesterday that First 
Brands Group’s chaotic bankruptcy could  
augur a new wave of corporate collapses.
Policymakers have spent the past decade  
shifting risk away from banks and into the 
hands of non-bank lenders. That strategy  
will have reduced systemic exposure, but 
it‘s also made it harder to track where  
the pressure in the economy is building.
Private credit ballooned when banks – faced  
with higher regulation - withdrew from riskier 
lending the wake of the global financial crisis;  
these new – private lenders sought to 
capture high returns in opaque markets,  
and were willing to put up with the risk doing so 
entailed. This has led to extraordinarily complex  
financial arrangements, many beyond the sight of 
regulators and even the institutions involved.
 
Private credit was supposed to be smarter. 
Lenders wrote bespoke contracts, tailored to  
each borrower. They avoided public disclosures, 
sidestepped mark-to-market volatility,  
and operated in bilateral relationships that 
promised flexibility in a downturn. The model  
was pitched as safer than bank lending and 
more disciplined than public debt markets.
 
First Brands shows how that model 
can break. The company had multiple  
layers of financing—some syndicated, some private, 
some off-balance sheet. Lenders didn’t have a  
full picture of the overall capital structure. 
Some may have thought they held senior claims,  
only to discover they were exposed to collateral 
that had been pledged more than once.
 
The fallout from First Brands and Tricolor has 
reached deep into Wall Street and the FT wrote  
an excellent piece on the winners and losers. 
Jefferies, which had been marketing First  
Brands’ debt just weeks before the collapse, 
now faces reputational damage. Its investment  
unit was also exposed to the company’s invoice 
financing—an arrangement that may not have been  
adequately disclosed to other lenders.
Millennium Management, one of the world’s  
largest hedge funds, is among those 
facing losses. Other asset managers,  
including PGIM and CIFC, held First Brands debt 
through collateralized loan obligations. Some of  
these CLOs bought the debt near face value. It 
now trades at just over 33 cents on the dollar.
 
Tricolor’s collapse has hit banks directly. 
JPMorgan, Barclays, and Fifth Third provided  
warehouse lines of credit to the company, 
expecting to be repaid once the auto loans  
were securitized. That repayment never came. 
Fifth Third has accused Tricolor of fraud,  
alleging the company pledged the same 
collateral to multiple lenders. The  
bank has warned of a $200 million impairment.
Bondholders are now scrambling to protect their  
claims. Clear Haven Capital has been calling 
other investors, urging them to coordinate  
legal strategies. Triumph Financial – 
a Dallas based bank - reportedly sent  
employees to Tricolor dealerships to repossess 
vehicles that were pledged as collateral. It’s  
unclear – based on the news reports if they sent 
lawyers or tow trucks drivers. Possibly both  
– you would probably need both…
Auditors are also coming under  
scrutiny. BDO gave First Brands a clean audit 
earlier this year and the company collapsed  
just months later, revealing a $12 billion web 
of liabilities. Deloitte was hired to produce  
a quality-of-earnings report, but the bankruptcy 
beat them to it. Timing, as ever, is everything.
 
Some investors saw the trouble coming. 
Apollo Global Management and Diameter  
Capital shorted First Brands debt before the 
collapse. Others moved in after the fact,  
buying distressed loans at steep discounts. 
Goldman Sachs reported that nearly $1 billion of  
First Brands debt changed hands in a single day.
Private credit is often described as being outside  
the banking system. That’s not quite true. 
Non-bank lenders—private credit funds, hedge  
funds, specialist finance firms—borrow from banks. 
They rely on revolving credit lines, warehouse  
facilities, and bridge loans. These arrangements 
don’t show up in public filings, but they matter.
 
Bank lending to non-bank financial institutions 
(NBFIs) has surged. It now accounts for all of  
the growth in bank lending this year. One 
regional bank reportedly has $62 billion  
in loans to shadow lenders—roughly a fifth of 
its loan book. Most of it is categorized as  
“business,” “private equity,” or “other.” 
which is finance-speak for “don’t ask.”
 
The risk isn’t just that these lenders might 
fail. It’s that they might draw down their  
credit lines at the worst possible moment. A 
non-bank financial institution under pressure  
is most likely to tap its bank credit just as 
the value of its collateral is falling. That’s  
what bankers call “wrong-way risk.” 
Regulators can see the exposures,  
but investors can’t. Quarterly filings 
don’t break out NBFI lending in useful ways.  
The system is opaque by design. That 
opacity is part of what makes it fragile.
 
Wall Street doesn’t seem rattled. The leveraged 
buyout of Electronic Arts—a mature gaming company  
with flat revenue—was announced just days after 
First Brands collapsed. If there’s fear in the  
market, it’s wearing noise-cancelling headphones. 
The deal, valued at $55 billion dollars, is the  
biggest leveraged buyout in history - 
topping in dollar value the $45bn buyout  
of Texas utility group TXU in 2007- which later 
filed for bankruptcy. The deal includes twenty  
billion dollars in debt and is described by the 
FT as “a huge bet that AI can significantly cut  
the companies operating costs, allowing the equity 
investors to manage a large debt load on a company  
that historically carried limited net debt. 
If there’s fear in the private credit market,  
it’s not showing up in the deal flow.
There’s no sign of a crisis - but there’s  
no real sign of caution either. 
The most revealing work on First  
Brands didn’t come from rating agencies or 
investor decks. It came from Robert Smith at  
the Financial Times. Smith and his team uncovered 
prior fraud allegations against Patrick James,  
the company’s founder by digging through court 
records—work that – it would appear - many lenders  
failed to do. The cases Smith found came out of 
losses during the financial crisis in 2008 and  
were for millions of dollars – not billions. 
These cases were settled - not dismissed.
 
Smith has spent years covering credit markets and 
has written about numerous scandals in the past.  
He recognized the warning signs: related-party 
complexity, off-balance-sheet debt, and lenders  
unaware of what other lenders were doing.
The FT’s coverage of First Brands was built  
on public records and financial statements. 
Smith has pointed out on LinkedIn that all  
of the factoring expenses were disclosed. The 
spreads were visible. Some investors saw the  
problem and walked away. Others didn’t bother 
to look. Smith’s reporting filled a gap that  
investor due diligence should have covered.
Credit markets aren’t exactly melting down. But  
they are not really compensating investors 
for the risks they’re taking either.
 
First Brands and Tricolor are not systemically 
important, and their failures didn’t trigger  
panic. But they possibly reveal how fragile 
some corners of the credit market have become,  
especially where opacity meets leverage. 
These weren’t exotic instruments held by  
speculative traders. They were AAA-rated 
securities, backed by collateral,  
sold to institutions that prize stability.
The structure of risk has changed a lot since the  
global financial crisis. Much of today’s subprime 
and corporate debt sits with investment managers,  
insurers, and pension funds—entities funded 
by longer-term liabilities. That’s a far cry  
from the asset-backed commercial paper 
and bank deposits that once underpinned  
the last crisis. But the funding model 
isn’t the only variable worth watching.
 
Private credit has grown rapidly and so has its 
reliance on bank financing. Robert Armstrong  
pointed out in a recent FT column that shadow 
banks now account for all of the growth in U.S.  
bank lending this year. At $1.7 trillion 
dollars – he points out that – Shadow Bank  
lending now represents 13 percent of total bank 
loans—and far more at the largest institutions. 
 
There’s no sign of fear in markets – other than 
the dollar being down about 10% year to date.  
Credit spreads are tight. Equity markets are 
buoyant and the largest leveraged buyout in  
history was announced – just days after First 
Brands collapsed. If investors are worried,  
they’re certainly not showing it.
But the question isn’t whether the  
market will unravel. It’s whether investors 
are being adequately compensated to take the  
risks they’re assuming. When spreads are 
thin and structures are opaque, even a  
stable system can produce nasty surprises. 
Some people in the comments have been saying  
that this channel has drifted from its stated 
focus on rap news – [Ted] you can forget about  
icey tea and scoopy scoopy dog dog. In Rap News 
- Bloomberg reported this week that a Canadian  
Hedge fund manager and meme stock investor 
has been standing outside the rapper Drakes  
House in Toronto - trying to convince Drake 
to say something about some stock. Many are  
arguing that Canadian regulators should crack 
down on this sort of thing - as if it actually  
works out – Other Canadian investors like The 
Plain Bagel – are likely to start harassing the  
Barenaked Ladies to write a song about Berkshire 
Hathaway. Who knows where this could all end. 
 
In other news, the FT reports that a convicted 
Chinese fraudster doing time with Sean John  
Combs (also known as Diddy, Puff Daddy, 
Puffy, P Diddy, Brother Love and Frank Black  
(not to be mistaken for Black Francis – from 
the Pixies) has been teaching a self help  
course in prison called “Free Game with Diddy” 
Guo – the Chinese fraudster (also known as Guo  
Wengui and Ho Wan Kwok) – describes Sean John 
Combs (also known as Diddy, Puff Daddy, Puffy,  
P Diddy, Brother Love and Frank Black (not to be 
confused with Black Francis – from the Pixies) as  
being very organized – he went on to say that he 
and Sean John Combs (who has a variety of aliases)  
had discussed creating an artificial intelligence 
platform together when they are released from  
jail – so we have that to look forward to.
