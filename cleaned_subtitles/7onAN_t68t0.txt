2021
was a bad year for natural disasters.
That was the year that floods
killed 1,700 people in Pakistan
and Europe began what would be
the worst drought in 500 years.
And that was the year
one of my clients turned to me and said,
"Is it really worth
solving climate change?"
Well, look, he was an investor.
What he wanted to understand
was the economic return
on the trillions of dollars
we have to spend to get to net zero.
So that's a good question, right?
And there's a good answer.
But I also found a problem.
You see, there's a huge gap
between the science and the economics.
The science is scary,
and it’s really detailed.
The science tells us
that we're leaving 12,000 years
of climate stability behind us.
Those floods and those droughts
are going to get more frequent
and more intense.
Crops may fail.
Fisheries collapse.
But then when you turn to the economics,
all that turbulence
and that kind of disruption
just seems to get lost in translation.
You find yourself looking at graphs
with suspiciously smooth curves:
rising temperatures,
steadily declining growth.
Now those graphs do tell us
something really important.
There really is a connection
between global warming
and our ability to build things
and make things and just get things done,
and the damages from that
get really big, really quickly.
But when I turned that analysis
into my first quadrillion-dollar slide
for my client,
it left him cold.
You see, the problem with the economics
is that it's robust,
but it doesn't actually do a very good job
of explaining how, in practice,
climate change will impact businesses
and households in the real economy.
And that's why all that turbulence
and disruption you expect to see,
that you actually need to see
if you want to prepare,
seems to disappear.
So that's what I want
to talk to you all about today.
Imagine we had as good an understanding
of the impact of climate
change on the economy
as we have of climate change itself.
Just as convincing and just as useful.
So let's start with natural disasters.
The big insurers estimate
that natural disasters cause
about 200 to 300 billion dollar's
worth of damages,
direct damages, every year.
And these numbers
are certainly more tangible.
You know, you can see
the collapsed bridges
and the flooded mines in the data.
But they're also incomplete.
Where are the lost revenues
for the factories
that relied on that mine,
or the lost income for the workers
that needed that bridge to get to work?
In fact, if we compare those numbers
with that quadrillion-dollar slide,
we can see we're missing
about 80 percent of the problem.
So this is what we need to do.
We need to take a bit of a step back
and then we need to focus
on the commercial relationships,
the financial mechanisms
that actually link companies together
and transmit climate impacts
around the economy.
So now, instead of chasing hurricanes
as they rampage through
the physical infrastructure,
we're going to trace them
as they reverberate
through the financial infrastructure.
And I know chasing hurricanes
sounds more fun, but honestly,
this is when you're going to start seeing
some of that turbulence
and that disruption
that we're looking for.
So take the American southeast.
We all know that hurricanes
regularly cause
billions of dollars of damage
along the coast.
But it doesn't stop there or then.
Insurance premiums are rising
as a result across the region.
And many households,
particularly those on low income,
many of whom are actually
inland, can't keep up.
So now we see rising mortgage defaults
and credit card delinquency.
And this is causing problems
for another set of financial institutions.
Or take the coffee industry.
In 2021, again, it was a bad year.
A major frost and drought
caused coffee production in Brazil
to fall by 20 percent.
But prices went up 30 percent
globally, in just one week.
And then they kept on rising.
Why? Why this kind of overreaction?
Well it started when many farmers
walked away from their forward contracts.
And forward contracts are actually there
to provide price stability
between coffee farmers, coffee buyers.
But when some farmers saw higher profits
available on the open market,
they left their buyers in the lurch.
And so now the buyers can't meet
their own onward commitments
into the futures market.
So they're scrambling to find cash
to keep those positions open.
They're scrambling to find
new coffee supplies to meet them.
And it's driving the price up
higher and higher.
So these are just two disparate examples
of how climate change causes turbulence
in our financial infrastructure.
But the real worry is that the financial
infrastructure itself
will break under rising pressure.
Because we're going to see
more extreme weather
in the next 10 years
than we saw in the last 10 years.
Those shocks are going to grow,
and the gaps between them
are going to shrink.
And we can already see
some of the warning signs.
Now in Florida,
several insurers have now gone bankrupt
or they've pulled out.
And now the state
is the single largest provider
of home insurance in Florida,
putting pressure on its budget.
In California,
climate risks are driving up
the cost of borrowing
for many of the local authorities
that actually need to invest
in preventing those risks.
So we may be heading
towards a tipping point,
at which point
the financial infrastructure
can't manage climate risk anymore.
And this isn't academic,
because if we can't manage climate risk,
we can't do a lot of things.
Imagine trying to get a mortgage
on a house that you can't insure.
You can't.
Or sell one that's become
uninsurable, for that matter.
You know, at scale,
this is major disruption.
And this isn't the normal, you know,
boom and bust cycle.
This is just bust, bust, broken.
So ...
This may all sound a bit
melodramatic to some of you.
You know, that extreme.
And that's fair enough.
There's a very real debate right now
between a growing set of voices
that are worrying about these
kinds of tipping points
and those that say, don't worry,
the financial system as a whole
will be able to manage climate risk
for many decades to come.
But I think for our purposes,
in a way it doesn't matter,
because there's huge benefit in being able
to better anticipate
the turbulence ahead, either way.
And I think the first step
in being able to better
anticipate the future
is recognizing that many
of the kind of tools and techniques
that we've traditionally relied on
don't really have
the imagination to do so.
You know, they're really rooted
in the status quo,
historical data, past trends.
So what we need to do
is look to other complex dynamic systems
and the way those are studied,
like evolutionary biology
or thermodynamics.
Ironically, environmental
science, energy networks.
And the field of complexity economics
does exactly this, right?
It borrows tools and techniques
from those other areas of study
and uses them to better anticipate
how shocks and trends
can reshape economies.
Of course, climate change
is both of those things, right?
Because you've got
falling productivity, rising risk,
punctuated by natural disasters.
And one of the key tools that many
of these fields use are simulations.
And in this context,
you should be thinking of them
as digital twins
of whatever system it is
that you're studying.
They're populated
with thousands of virtual actors,
each with their own rules of behavior
and, critically,
the connections between them.
You set them up, and you let them run.
You can test them against reality
and calibrate them.
And then you can run experiments.
What would happen if we had
a different setup?
What will happen in future?
So urban planners use simulations
to prove that sometimes
demolishing a major road
can actually ease traffic congestion.
Ecologists use simulations to show
why fish stocks can collapse
even after you've put
fish quotas in place.
The important thing
about both of those results
is that they're unexpected.
They're not intuitive.
And this is what we need,
where global warming
meets the global economy.
From our systems thinkers,
from our risk modelers,
from our data scientists.
We need models that surprise us
before the future does.
Because once we've done that,
there's a whole bunch
of things that we can do
to better manage the disruption ahead.
I'll give you one quick example.
Imagine insurance
that just pays out to farmers
as soon as they're hit
by a natural disaster.
They're back on their feet,
minimal impact on their customers.
Well this product exists,
it's called parametric insurance.
But the challenge is scaling it up
because you've got to find terms
that are going to work for thousands,
tens of thousands of farmers,
year after year, shock after shock.
OK, but now imagine you've got
a simulation of, say, the coffee industry,
and you can test those terms
against the shocks of the past
and about potential futures.
And that's just one of several innovations
that could make the financial
infrastructure of the coffee industry
more resilient.
And we need exactly that kind
of innovation across the real economy.
With the right tools,
what felt like an impenetrable
fog of uncertainty,
starts to feel like a landscape
ripe for opportunity.
So what would I say to my client today?
Well, firstly, the economic case
for climate action is clear.
We're talking about safeguarding
maybe 25 percent of global GDP
between now and 2100.
But there's a second investment case.
In building resilience
to the financial turbulence
that we're going to experience on the way.
Because climate change is now inevitable,
at least for the next 75 years.
But the scale of the economic
disruption is not.
And what we build together,
the models, the new products,
the collaborations,
will determine how much we spend
clearing up the mess as we go
and how much we can invest
in actually solving the problem.
Thank you so much for your time.
