Last weekend, President Trump tweeted the idea of 
creating a 50-year mortgage as a way to help lower  
payments for Americans who want to buy a home. 
Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte  
called the proposal “a complete game changer.” It 
might sound clever – but it just isn’t. Let’s look  
at why stretching debt across half a century would 
likely be disastrous for home buyers—and what  
history tells us about ideas like this.
While the idea is (so far) quite light  
on detail - administration officials are 
saying that a 50-year mortgage would lower  
monthly payments and help Americans who are 
currently priced out of the housing market.
 
The logic is that if you just lengthen the 
term of a loan you can reduce the monthly  
payment – but that simplicity hides a much more 
complicated reality. Extending mortgages to half  
a century would alter how lenders price risk, 
how investors value mortgage-backed securities,  
and would require changes to federal law.
US Home prices have risen about 45% since 2020,  
with most of that increase having occurred during 
the pandemic years when interest rates fell near  
zero. Today - mortgage rates are at their 
highest level in twenty years, and you would  
normally expect that to depress home prices – but 
instead home prices have barely budged since rates  
went up. Limited housing supply has kept values 
elevated – but - sales volumes have dropped to  
their lowest level in decades. On top of that 
- the average age of a first-time buyer has  
now reached 40. Against that backdrop, a longer 
loan term might look like a lifeline—until you  
check the fine print. The economics—and politics 
are unfortunately way more complicated than the  
headlines suggest. On the bright side however 
this proposal would allow many Americans the  
opportunity to pass something down to their kids 
– unfortunately that thing would be a mortgage…
 
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage feels 
like a permanent feature of American life,  
but it was born out of crisis. Ben Castleman wrote 
an excellent history of the US mortgage market a  
few years ago in The New York Times. He explains 
that before the Great Depression - home loans were  
underwritten by banks – and not backed by the US 
government. They usually had terms of 10 years  
or less (as lenders don’t like making really 
long term loans) and, unlike mortgages today,  
they were not “self-amortizing” meaning that 
borrowers just made interest payments and the loan  
carried a balloon payment at the end. This meant 
that borrowers would often have to take out a new  
mortgage to pay off the old one if they hadn’t 
saved up. When the financial system collapsed  
during the Great Depression, refinancing dried up 
and foreclosures soared – such that in the early  
1930s, nearly 10 percent of U.S. homes – and I 
mean homes – not mortgages - were in foreclosure.
 
To stabilize the housing market, the federal 
government issued government-backed bonds so  
that they could buy up defaulted mortgages 
and reissue them as fixed-rate loans that had  
longer maturities and lower monthly payments. 
The government then sold off those mortgages  
to private investors, with the Federal Housing 
Administration providing mortgage insurance so  
those investors knew the loans they were buying 
would be paid off in full. Fannie Mae and, later,  
Freddie Mac changed the scale of the system by 
creating a secondary market. They bought mortgages  
from lenders, bundled them into securities, 
and sold them to investors. That liquidity  
allowed banks to recycle capital and offer even 
more loans, turning the 30-year mortgage from a  
government experiment into a mass-market product. 
By the 1960s, the 30-year mortgage had become the  
dominant structure. Its appeal was obvious: 
predictable payments, no prepayment penalties,  
and the ability to refinance when rates fell. 
Castleman points out that for US homeowners  
the 30 year fixed rate loan is a one-sided bet. 
If inflation goes way up, the lenders lose and  
the borrowers win. While if interest rates fall, 
the borrower can just refinance at a lower rate.
 
Other countries took different paths. In Britain 
and Canada, fixed rates typically last just a  
few years – and until recently Canadian Mortgages 
were 25 year loans. Germany offers long-term fixed  
rate loans but restricts refinancing. Denmark’s 
system resembles America’s but demands higher  
down payments and stricter underwriting. The 
U.S. stands out for combining long duration,  
fixed rates, and easy refinancing—a mix 
that shields existing homeowners but  
can freeze mobility when interest rates 
rise – which is what we have just seen.
 
On paper, it sounds easy - stretch the 
term and shrink the payment. In practice,  
it would be a legislative and financial 
contortion act - it would require rewriting  
federal law. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, qualified 
mortgages can’t have terms longer than 30 years,  
so a 50-year product would need new legislation 
before lenders could offer it at scale.
 
Before digging into why a fifty year loan 
wouldn’t even reduce monthly payments – let  
me tell you about this weeks video sponsor 
Gamma – a presentation tool that I’ve used to  
create many of the images in this weeks video. For 
business people and marketers, presentations are  
the language of persuasion. If you present your 
ideas well, they lead to favorable decisions and  
investments. A boring presentation, on the other 
hand, can put your audience to sleep. Gamma can be  
thought of as a modern alternative to PowerPoint. 
And if you're not a graphic designer, but have a  
big idea to communicate, presentations just got a 
whole lot easier as Gamma can take simple text or  
a document and quickly turn it into an impressive 
presentation in seconds. To try out Gamma,  
I took the transcript of last week's video, 
uploaded it to Gamma, and asked it to create  
a presentation. Seconds later, it returned slides 
that picked out the most important points. to try  
it out. Just start with an idea. Describe what 
you want and Gamma takes it from there. Creating  
a perfect deck in seconds. I've started using 
Gamma to make a lot of the slides in my videos  
as it's so much easier and better than my old 
workflow. With GMA, you're not stuck with the  
16x9 format that other presentation software’s 
use. You can use it to make vertical presentations  
or even modular websites. Visit gamma.app app on

Reports suggest that the social media  
announcements caught parts of the Trump team 
off guard. According to Politico and CBS,  
Bill Pulte pitched the idea directly to Trump, 
who posted it online without any vetting. Some  
aides and conservative allies criticized the 
move, calling it bad policy and bad politics.
 
Trump later appeared to distance himself from 
the proposal. When asked about it on Fox News,  
he told the reporter it “might help a little 
bit” but overall he seemed to brush it off.
 
At first glance - the 50-year mortgage 
sounds like a great way of cutting monthly  
loan payments – kinda like the way mortgages were 
restructured during the great depression – from  
ten years with a balloon payment to thirty years 
and self-amortizing. If a fifty-year mortgage had  
the same interest rate as a thirty-year mortgage 
has, the monthly payment on the average American  
mortgage would fall by around $250 dollars 
a month. The problem is - that rates on a  
fifty-year mortgage wouldn’t be the same as 
they are on a thirty-year mortgage. Longer  
terms carry more risk, and lenders won’t take 
that risk if they are not compensated for it.  
Analysts estimate that a 50-year loan could cost 
75 to 100 basis points more than thirty-year does.  
With the higher interest rate - the monthly 
payment would barely change—and in some cases,  
it would even rise – and even meme stock 
investors won’t sign up for a higher  
monthly payment that continues on for twenty 
additional years. That’s just not affordability…
 
Even if the 50 year interest rate wasn’t 
higher (which it would be) – and you saw that  
$250 a month saving, the trade-offs are still 
severe. After a decade, the average American with  
a 30-year mortgage has built roughly $60,000 
dollars in equity – that’s assuming no house  
price appreciation. On a 50-year loan, it would 
be closer to $11,000 dollars – and that is just  
because so much is being paid in interest. With 
interest rates at 6.4% - the average American will  
spend around half a million dollars on interest 
– on their 30 year mortgage - which is more than  
they pay for their home - but when we extend 
that mortgage to 50 years they will pay more  
than a million dollars in interest expense alone. 
The other (and probably more important) thing that  
we have to remember is that if lower payments 
do make easier to borrow larger sums of money,  
buyers can be expected to just bid up home prices 
– as more buying power is introduced into a market  
struggling with supply – it would erase pretty 
much all of the promised affordability gain.
 
The problem isn’t that Americans can’t 
borrow—it’s that there aren’t enough homes.  
If the average U.S. home costs $425,000 and every 
American was handed $425,000 dollars tomorrow,  
it wouldn’t mean universal homeownership. It 
would mean home prices would spike by roughly  
$400,000 and the malls would be busy for 
a few weeks. That’s what happens when you  
pump demand into a market with fixed supply: 
prices rise, affordability doesn’t improve.
 
The U.K.’s “Help to Buy” scheme in 2022 proved 
the point. It let first-time buyers purchase  
new-build homes with smaller deposits and gave 
them a government equity loan of up to 20% of  
the property’s value. Many joked at the time 
that it should have been called “Help to Sell  
scheme,” because it did more for developers than 
it did for buyers. Longer mortgages risk the same  
outcome—boosting demand without adding supply.
The AP points out that other parts of the  
financial system have already extended loan terms 
– and with mixed results. Seven-year auto loans  
have become increasingly popular as car prices 
have gone up. Despite these longer loan terms,  
auto loan delinquencies have been rising, and the 
average price of a new car is now just under fifty  
thousand dollars compared to thirty nine thousand 
dollars for a new vehicle just five years ago.
 
Student loans too - were originally 
designed to be paid off in 10 years,  
and now there are multiple payment options 
available that extend repayment out to 20 years.
 
Most Americans – we should remember - don’t stay 
in the homes they buy for life. The average tenure  
is around 12 years, which means that not 
that many borrowers ever reach the midpoint  
of amortization on a thirty-year mortgage. 
Mortgage payments are split between interest  
and principal – meaning that early on, your 
payment mostly feeds the interest monster – while  
principal barely gets a snack… As you make 
payments, the principal is slowly reduced,  
which then lowers the amount of interest accrued 
each month. This process, called amortization,  
causes a shift over time, so more of your 
payment goes toward principal and less  
toward interest. On a 30-year mortgage, this 
shift happens gradually, so by year 10 you’ve  
paid down a meaningful chunk of the loan.
With a 50-year mortgage, the payment schedule  
stretches so far that the early years barely touch 
the principal. After a decade, you might still  
owe almost the full amount you borrowed. The 
way it works is that the longer the term of the  
loan – the slower you build equity. A fifty year 
mortgage would leave homeowners exposed if prices  
fall, and limit their ability to sell, relocate, 
or borrow against their home in an emergency.
 
For first-time buyers who are now only 
entering the market at the age of 40,  
the arithmetic is stark: they would still 
be making mortgage payments into their 90s.  
It’s worth remembering that the word ‘mortgage’ 
comes from the French words mort and gage meaning  
“death pledge”. With a fifty year mortgage - 
that’s no longer just a figure of speech. 
 
It’s not hard to see either - why lenders might 
balk at issuing loans that extend deep into  
retirement – do you really want to take the 
risk of lending to a person who is no longer  
earning and may not be in good health? 
The idea of borrowing for 50 years to buy  
an asset you’re unlikely to keep for more than a 
dozen doesn’t make much financial sense. You’re  
essentially either renting the 
house or renting the money to  
buy it – you don’t own it until its paid off.
The idea of making mortgage payments in retirement  
is quite worrying too - in a world where the 
demand for reverse mortgages has started rising.  
With a reverse mortgage, homeowners, typically age 
62 or older, get cash from a lender in exchange  
for the equity in their home. They continue to 
live in the property and pay taxes and insurance.  
The loans then have to be repaid with interest 
at the end of their term – which is usually when  
the borrower either moves out, sells the home 
or dies. Reverse mortgages are a controversial  
type of lending already - because of the increased 
risk of foreclosure on an elderly retiree if they  
fall behind on their tax or insurance payments.
According to the Financial Times, the number of  
US federally insured reverse mortgages grew more 
than 6 percent in the last year. Lenders report  
surging interest from older Americans squeezed 
by inflation and benefit cuts. If the current  
generation of elderly homeowners are facing 
this level of financial stress - extending  
mortgage debt into old age with fifty-year 
mortgages would only make that problem worse.
 
The psychological dimension really matters too. A 
mortgage that outlives a career—and possibly the  
borrower—really changes the cultural meaning 
of homeownership. A home becomes less of an  
asset and more of a perpetual liability.
Other countries have experimented with  
ultra-long mortgages – and - Spoiler Alert! it 
didn’t end well... Japan introduced 50-year and  
even 100-year loans during its property 
bubble in the 1980s. Those products were  
designed to let families pass debt across 
generations. When the bubble burst, borrowers  
were trapped in negative equity for decades.
In the UK and Canada, lenders have offered 35-  
to 40-year mortgages, but these remain niche 
products. Regulators tightened rules after  
concerns that longer terms just inflated home 
prices and did nothing to improve affordability. 
 
The obvious problem is that longer loans don’t 
build new houses. You can play around with monthly  
payments, but all that will do is push house 
prices even higher - leaving borrowers with slower  
equity growth and greater exposure to downturns.
The problem in the US real estate market has  
nothing to do with an inability or an 
unwillingness to borrow – it is more  
driven by a shortage of new housing than anything 
else. And that shortage is not going to improve  
when America has an ageing population a 
growing labour shortage and is deporting  
the people who work in construction. 
Tariffs are not helping affordability  
either – According to the NAHB - Tariffs are 
driving up the cost of building materials,  
and American consumers end up paying for the 
tariffs in the form of higher home prices.
 
Turning a 50-year mortgage from a tweet 
into a product isn’t just a matter of  
tweaking paperwork—it means rewriting 
the whole rulebook. Under Dodd-Frank,  
any mortgage longer than 30 years cannot meet 
the Qualified Mortgage standard. That status  
matters to lenders as it shields them from certain 
liabilities and allows them to offer lower rates.  
Without this protection - you’re left with 
a riskier product that lenders won’t touch  
without charging a significant premium.
The fix isn’t going to be an executive order  
either… It would require Congress to amend 
multiple statutes, including those governing  
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac who can’t insure or 
purchase loans beyond 30 years. Without their  
backing, liquidity evaporates and investors 
aren’t queueing up for a 50-year instrument  
that behaves like a callable bond with 
a half-century of credit risk attached.
 
Even if lawmakers clear that hurdle, the market 
mechanics get ugly. Longer maturities magnify  
prepayment risk, forcing GSEs into more aggressive 
hedging. That hedging is pro-cyclical—meaning  
it amplifies interest rate swings instead of 
smoothing them. Alan Greenspan worried about  
this dynamic with 30-year loans; a 50-year variant 
would crank systemic risk up another notch.
 
After all of that - there’s the consumer 
protection angle. Regulators designed the rules  
to prevent borrowers from signing up for loans 
that they can’t realistically repay. A mortgage  
that stretches into your 90s makes that concern 
more than theoretical. Disclosure requirements,  
suitability standards, and retirement-risk 
assessments would all need a rethink.
 
If the goal is affordability, there are better 
ways to get there than stretching debt across  
half a century. The obvious fix is supply: 
build more homes where people want to live.  
That means tackling zoning bottlenecks, 
speeding up permitting, addressing labor  
shortages and doing away with tariffs 
that hit construction materials.
 
Financial engineering is seductive because 
it looks so easy – and - why do something  
hard like streamlining zoning and permitting 
when you can just encourage buyers to take  
more financial risk. It’s easier to tweet about 
mortgages than it is to bulldoze zoning laws.
 
Other options include revisiting 
tax incentives for builders,  
streamlining approvals for multi-family projects, 
and investing in infrastructure to unlock land for  
development. These approaches attack the real 
constraint—housing supply—rather than papering  
over it with longer amortization schedules.
Everyone wants lower prices when they’re  
buying—or when their kids are—but once 
they own, they want values to rise forever.  
Politicians talk about affordability, but a sharp 
drop in home prices would be treated as a crisis,  
not a victory. Stewart Lee captured the 
absurdity perfectly on his TV show back in  
2008 saying “What’s happened is somewhere, along 
the line, as a society, we confused the notion of  
‘home’ with the possibility of ‘an investment 
opportunity’. What kind of creature wants to  
live in an ‘investment opportunity’? Only man. 
The fox has his den. The bee has his hive. The  
stoat has his stoat-hole… but only man chooses 
to make his nest in an investment opportunity.”
 
A 50-year mortgage won’t make homes affordable. 
It trims a few dollars off monthly payments  
while adding decades of debt and mountains of 
interest. That’s not an affordability solution.
 
The hard truth is that affordability comes from 
supply, not slogans. Building homes is messy,  
political, and slow, which is why gimmicks like 
ultra-long mortgages keep popping up. They look  
like progress but do nothing to fix the shortage.
Japan tried this in the 80s with 50-year and  
even 100-year loans. When the bubble burst, 
families spent decades in negative equity.  
America doesn’t need to repeat that mistake.
