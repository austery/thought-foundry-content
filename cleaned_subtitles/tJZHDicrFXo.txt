The 2024 US presidential election is over
Trump becomes president of the United States again
It can be said to be a great victory for the American right.
<font color =#FFE700FF>Day 1 I will launch the largest deportation program in American history
.</font>
Anti-immigration, anti-abortion, anti-environmental protection, anti-political correctness
The book I’m going to face today is “Strangers in Hometown”
Let’s talk about the rise of the American right
The author of this book is American sociologist Arlie R. Hochschild
She made an in-depth visit to the stronghold of the American right: Louisiana
Conducted in-depth interviews locally for 5 years
Trying to be sympathetic and understanding
Thinking from the right perspective
Understanding why many Americans are moving to the right
First, let’s define what a rightist is
Different countries will develop different right-wing ideas
In the United States, we can understand the right as a trend of thought that opposes big government
Think government regulation is a problem
rather than solving the problem
< font color=#FAFF00FF>In this present crisis , </font> <font color=#FAFF00FF>In this present crisis
, </font>
<font color=#FAFF00FF>Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.</font> <font color=#FAFF00FF>Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem
.</font>
Like opposition to abortion rights, opposition to gun bans, opposition to environmental regulations
The central idea behind this
In fact, they are all against the government's power penetrating into people's lives.
Philosophically called "minimal government"
The best government is that which governs least
Looking back at history
We will find that the divisions between the left and the right in the United States are becoming more and more serious.
In the 1930s, in order to combat the Great Depression, the United States
Seeking strong government intervention to implement Roosevelt's New Deal
But by the 2008 financial crisis
Most Americans are not asking the government to intervene
Instead, the right launched the Tea Party movement
Oppose the Obama administration to use taxpayers' money to bail out banks
The results of the right's demand for less government intervention
Most obviously reflected in taxes
During President Eisenhower's administration in the 1950s
The top earners in the U.S. pay 91% of taxes
But in 2015, it became only 40%
The author thinks
The rivalry between left and right is gradually dividing the United States
A 1960 U.S. poll asked Americans
Would it bother you if your child married someone from another political party?
Less than 5% of Americans say yes
But by 2010, 40% of people said they would
There are also spatial differences in the distribution of left and right factions in the United States.
From 1972 to 2014
Southern white support for Democrats continues to decline
dropped from 41% to 24%
So to understand why Americans are turning to the right
To understand these white southerners
First of all, the author would like to refute several wrong ways of understanding
The first is to regard the right as populists manipulated by the media
Like director Taki Oldham shot a documentary
Pointing out that climate change conspiracy theories originated from a group of citizens
These groups are funded by oil companies
The Koch brothers, the big capitalists in the United States, in 2016
Funded $880 million to right-wing candidates
Vows to curb EPA's authority
So the rise of the right is actually the result of being misled by people from the wealthy class.
Through a series of external propaganda, the rich
Let the poor support policies that are detrimental to them
The author believes that the problem with this argument is that
You treat right-wing voters as idiots
It seems like these people are easily manipulated by public opinion
Right-wing voters can turn around and question those who voted for Democrats
How do you know that you are not also being manipulated by the media?
Is the source of your information also funded by the Democratic Party?
There is another kind of argument that would say
Both the left and the right actually follow their moral intuitions when voting.
Psychologist Haidt mentioned in his book "Good People Are Always Self-Righteous":
People on the right prefer a sense of authority and loyalty
Compliance with authoritative political leaders
The left likes subversion and originality
Instead, they scorn leaders who establish a sense of authority and loyalty.
So the right is not misled by the media
But the left and right all follow their own moral sense when voting.
The author believes that this kind of moral psychology research
Ignoring the emotional dimension of politics
People’s feelings are actually what most directly drives people to vote.
Therefore, the author has to go deep into the right-wing groups
Feel it with them
See how political sentiment drives people to the right
A major claim of the American right is to deny global warming
<font color=#FEFF00FF>There is no climate crisis. it is a hoax .</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>There is no climate crisis. it is a hoax
.</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Trump said the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese</font> <font color= #FEFF00FF>he said the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.</font>
Opposition to regulating greenhouse gases
Support petrochemical companies’ exploration of oil
For example, Trump has promised that after taking office, the United States will withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement
and vigorously promote the U.S. petrochemical industry
<font color=#FEFF00FF >We will drill, baby, drill </font> <font color=#FEFF00FF >We will drill, baby, drill </font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>We're gonna drill .</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>We're gonna drill
.</font>
To understand the right’s views on environmental issues
The author went to Louisiana, the stronghold of the right wing, for an interview
The environment here is seriously polluted
The cancer rate ranks second in the country
But voters backed the oil industry and demanded the elimination of the EPA
How to explain this contradiction?
The author found
Louisiana was originally a Democratic Party stronghold
Supported the Democratic Party before the 1970s
But after the 1970s, he shifted to the right and supported the Republican Party.
Because from the 1960s to the 1970s
Leftists launch environmental movement
Like Rachel Carson publishing Silent Spring
American college students launch World Earth Day
Finally, the U.S. government established the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970
Establish national parks, push for clean water act
This series of policies with good interests
But it's affecting livelihoods in Louisiana.
In 1987, the U.S. state government issued a fishery alert
Said local industrial wastewater polluted rivers and the Gulf of Mexico
One-third of the seafood Americans eat comes from the Gulf of Mexico
The seafood industry offers plenty of job opportunities
So when the government orders
The locals feel that the government is causing them to lose their jobs.
The thinking logic of these people is
The more government controls, the more jobs will be destroyed
Vote for the party that rejects environmental regulations
to develop the oil industry
Oil brings jobs
work brings money
Money brings more development
Living the American Dream
The local economy will be more prosperous
less need for government subsidies
can reduce the power of government
The result of this is
Many petrochemical companies deliberately moved to right-wing states
to avoid being subject to environmental regulations
or toxic waste from other states.
will be sent to louisiana
As a result, the amount of locally imported hazardous waste ranks third in the United States.
The 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill
Obama calls this the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history
Ask BP to suspend drilling in Louisiana
But half of the local residents said there should be no suspension.
Because oil extraction can continue to bring in revenue
local residents say
"The oil spill is sad, but the government's request to suspend oil drilling is even more annoying."
But the author found
The right-wing argument that "relaxing regulations will help economic development"
In fact, it is inconsistent with empirical research
Statistical findings from MIT political scientist Stephen Meyer
Places with stricter environmental regulations
More job opportunities are provided
Not just the United States
This is true for major economies around the world
Data shows the petrochemical industry actually generates only 10% of jobs in Louisiana
Why is it so low?
Because first
The petrochemical industry is actually highly automated
Workers are only needed when building a factory
Then all it takes is a trained operator
Second, many companies actually hire migrant workers
Because they are cheaper
For example, on the oil drilling platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, there are Filipino and Mexican workers.
Therefore, it is not correct for those petrochemical companies to say that they can bring job opportunities to the local area.
Another right-wing defense of the oil economy is that
Economic development will bring economic infiltration
Improve local wage employment opportunities
In fact, local wages are not infiltrating but flowing out.
Because these petrochemical companies are all foreign-owned
All the money goes into the pockets of shareholders
instead of local people's pockets
Filipino and Mexican workers working locally
Even if they make money, they won’t spend it locally.
Instead, send it back to your home country to your family
According to statistics
One-third of the net output value created by the petrochemical industry is outflows
in other words
Developing the petrochemical industry has not improved the local economy
until today
Louisiana is still the poorest state in the United States (fourth from bottom)
But this leads to a paradox
Why do people on the right
Obviously there is no economic recovery in sight
I don’t like environmental pollution either
Yet they continue to vote for the Republican Party and demand less government regulation of enterprises?
To understand the right
We must understand where their antipathy towards the government comes from
In 2012, a Bayou Corne sinkhole occurred in Louisiana.
A Texas brine company drills for high-concentration salt
Drilled thousands of feet underground
Causes oil to seep around salt blocks
A huge seepage hole appears
Many people were forced to relocate
Become an energy refugee
As a result, the Texas Brine Company passed the blame to government officials.
The environmental impact assessment report shows
Before the government
I have long known that the local geological structure is very thin
But they still gave them drilling permits.
inspector general says
Because there is a culture of expecting the government to protect industry
So even if the environmental impact assessment should not be passed, it will still be approved.
This makes local residents think that the problem lies with the government
rather than a business
The author was surprised to find
In fact, local right-wing residents are very concerned about environmental protection.
They are against the government
<font color=#FFFA00FF>We have had Democratic and Republican governors. </font> <font color=#FFFA00FF>We have democrat governors, we have republican governors
. </font>
<font color=#FFFA00FF>I haven't seen much difference in our situation .
</font>
These people believe that many social problems are caused by government intervention.
The less government interference the better
Just leave it to the free market
For example, in tax
Right-wingers think IRS is corrupt
Taxpayers don’t know where the government is spending their money.
It may be used to subsidize idle unemployed people, black people, and immigrants.
The author asked these right-wingers
But the taxes you pay will also be used for social insurance.
They replied that if we didn't have to pay taxes
We can use this money to invest
Already become a millionaire
The right's opposition to government regulation resulted in
Louisiana is America's drinking state
One of the loosest gun control states
The local gun fatality rate is the highest in the United States
despite this
Locals still believe in the right to use guns
Believing that if the Democratic Party takes office, it will restrict people's freedom to own guns, this is anti-democratic
For example, when Obama first took office, the right spread rumors that the new government would confiscate people's guns.
One interviewer even told the author
There will be dictatorships in the Middle East
cannot democratize
It's because their people don't have guns
The author found
The right is very disgusted with the government
Emotionally, they will rely more on the support of the church.
Almost everyone in Louisiana goes to church
Faith provides these people with emotional comfort
For example, companies that cause pollution do not compensate local people.
At this time, local people will seek help from their faith
Believe that God is a witness
will help them survive these trials.
When these people become disillusioned with the government
It happens to be faith that gives them hope
Many Republican congressmen will publicly profess their belief in God
Hospitals in many states in the United States were also funded and built by churches.
When environmentalists say we need to protect extinct animals
When you can't do more development
Instead, with the help of the local church
People can turn over if they have the chance to realize the American dream
Many capitalists also say when setting up factories locally
Everyone should regard financial success as a gift from God
2006
The American Public Broadcasting Station aired a program called "Is God Environmentally Friendly?"
Invite evangelical pastors to debate
<font color=#FEFF00FF>political environmental movement, what we call the green Dragon</font> < font color=#FEFF00FF>political environmental movement, what we call the green Dragon</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>has become one of the greatest threats to society and the church in our day .</font>
These pastors think
Biblical views would endorse oil enterprise exploitation
Because God originally allowed humans to rule the earth
According to the Bible
The earth will face the end of the world in the future
Only believers will be saved and enter the kingdom of heaven
And those who disbelieve will remain on earth
You might think this is something only a few people believe
But according to a 2010 Pew Research Center report
41% of people in the United States believe that Jesus’ resurrection will occur around 2050
There are 30 million members in the American evangelical church today
Equivalent to 1/4 of the US electorate population
So Trump is very clear about winning over evangelical voters
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Religion and Christianity are the biggest things missing from this country</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>Religion and Christianity are the biggest things missing from this country</font>
< font color=#FEFF00FF>I truly believe that we need to bring them back</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>and I truly believe that we need to bring them back</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>We have to bring them back fast</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>we have to bring them back fast</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF> I think it's one of the biggest problems we have . </font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>That's why our country
is going haywire</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Because
we have lost our religion</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>we've lost religion in our country.</font>
When Trump loses the election in 2020
It was evangelical groups who stormed the Capitol to protest.
After Trump’s shooting this year
American right-wing and evangelical groups even regard Trump as the Messiah sent by God to save the United States.
<font color =# FFF600FF>I was knocked to the ground essentially by what seemed like a supernatural hand </font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>I would like to thank that god saved me for a purpose</font> <font color=#FFF600FF>and I would like to thank that god saved me for a purpose</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>And that's to make our country greater than ever before
.</font>
Some critics would even say
It's evangelicals who control American politics
It can be said that American society has collectively turned to the right.
Conservative religious groups are an important push

Next, the author will talk about the right-wing opposition to political correctness.
How do people on the right feel about this?
The American working class generally believes in the American Dream
This is a narrative of progress
Believe that the next generation can live a better life than the previous generation
This American dream is originally very consistent with the moral values ​​of the right.
Think that a person who works hard is a good person
Those who don’t want to work should starve
no pain no gain
There is no such thing as a free lunch
Therefore, the government should not impose taxes to redistribute wealth.
If taxes were imposed to distribute the wealth of the top 10% of the rich to the poor
This is only effective for the short term
Because poor people don’t know how to invest and manage money
All the money was spent in no time
Will still continue to be poor
And the top 10% of wealthy people still have ways to make their money back
So we shouldn’t rely on government handouts
But to start from scratch
He is an American with a sense of honor.
But in the 1960s
The queue for the American Dream is disrupted
Disadvantaged groups began to come out to fight for their rights
Women's movement, black civil rights movement, LGBT movement, environmental movement
In 1964, President Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act and implemented preferential differential treatment.
Discrimination is prohibited and disadvantaged groups must be hired
For example, Aboriginal people can receive university tuition subsidies
The federal government also promotes affirmative action programs for minorities
Allow black people to obtain diverse admissions places in college and work
This has led many on the right to believe
Obama can go to an Ivy League school and be elected president
I basically relied on various government benefits to get up there.
Next comes the feminist movement
Let a large number of women enter the workplace
Many institutions will set up female protection quotas
Let the right feel that women are starting to compete with men for job opportunities
Next is immigration
There are a large number of Mexicans, Filipinos, and Chinese who want to work in the United States and obtain green cards.
These people are willing to do low-paying jobs
As a result, the overall wages of white American workers have been lowered.
Finally, even animals and the environment have received more attention from the government
Like after the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico
Government calls for halt to oil drilling
causing local white workers to lose their jobs
White workers originally chasing the American dream
But I see the government giving priority to welfare benefits to black people, women, immigrants, and environmental protection
These white workers felt like they were being jumped in line.
At this time, liberals came out again and said
These benefits are designed to combat racial discrimination and sexism
Because they don't have white male privileges
< font color=#F7FF00FF>White supremacy is a poison </font> <font color=#F7FF00FF>White supremacy is a poison
. </font>
<font color=#F7FF00FF>
It really is.</font>
This makes the white workers at the bottom feel baffled
Because in the past 20 years
They are actually a group of people sacrificed by capitalism
I don't feel privileged at all.
Instead, I feel a kind of despair and death
Economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton discovered that
In the past 20 years, the United States
"Deaths of despair" caused by suicide, drug and alcohol abuse are on the rise
Average life expectancy in the United States has even shrunk in the past three years
This commonly occurs among middle-aged white male workers without a college degree
But liberals think these people are rednecks
Don’t understand the value of progress
Poor white workers in the southern United States were even called "white trash"
For example, Trump's deputy JD Vance once wrote his autobiography "Song of the Desperate"
Expressing the despair of lower-class white workers unable to move upward
<font color=#FFF900FF>You have to take responsibility for yourself and study hard</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Ｙou got to take care of business, you got to go to school </font>
<font color=#FFF900FF >You got to get good grades to even have a chance.</font> <font color=#FFF900FF>You got to get good grades to even have a chance .</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Mom is number one in the class, what’s the use? </font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>Mom was the best in her class. what's the point?</font>
< font color=#FFF900FF>I'm talking about a chance
.</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>You might not make it, but you sure as hell won't if you don't try</font>
<font color=#FFF900FF>You might not make it, but you sure as hell won't if you don 't try.</font>
These white people feel like "strangers in their hometown"
Not taken care of by the government
All the taxes paid are used to take care of the disadvantaged groups
In the end, he was called white trash by liberals.
All speeches are politically incorrect
Many people have worked until they are 60 years old
Already seen through the impossibility of the American dream
At this time, these people have to look for a sense of honor and accomplishment from other sources.
For example, turn to family values
Emphasis on heterosexual marriage, anti-abortion
Giving birth to a child is a sense of responsibility
It is a manifestation of attaching importance to family values.
This is exactly what liberals don't understand
So a lot of things that are considered a laughing stock in the eyes of liberals
Such as anti-environmental protection, anti-abortion, superstitious religion
In fact, it happens to be a source of pride for right-wingers.
After reading the historical context of the rise of the right,
We can better understand Trump’s appeal to the right
First of all, Trump is not bound by political correctness
He said everything that many lower-class white workers wanted to say.
Misogynistic, anti-immigrant, and mocking people with disabilities
<font color =#FEFF00FF>You gotta see this guy ah</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF >You gotta see this guy ah</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF> I don't know what I said ah . I don't remember .</font>
This is not a problem for the right
On the contrary, it is a kind of liberation
Finally no longer need to be oppressed by liberal political correctness
So listening to Trump speak will bring a sense of comfort to the right
<font color=#FEFF00FF>In Springfield
,</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>they're eating
the dogs.</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>The people that came in they're eating the cats </font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>They're eating the pets of the people that live there</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>This is what's happening in our country .</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>and this is what's happening in our country .</font>
It's this kind of feeling
Let the right no longer feel like strangers in their hometown
However, liberal and leftist analyzes only focus on the economic level
And ignored the feeling of pleasure brought by Trump
Another Trump appeal is that
Be able to reject the left’s “language of victimhood”
The left likes to say that women are oppressed by patriarchy
Black people are oppressed by racial discrimination
Homosexuals are oppressed by heterosexual hegemony
This kind of language treats people as if they are victims.
But the right doesn't like to think of itself as a victim
Even in fact
Louisiana rightists are victims of capitalist industrial pollution
But the interviewer told the author that
Pollution is a necessary sacrifice for capitalist freedom
The right thinks the victim complex is something only the left likes to talk about
Point the finger at white men as being responsible for these things
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Let's talk about George Floyd
. </font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>You said George Floyd's death was a terrible thing terrible. </font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Terrible
.</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Why are African Americans still dying at the hands of law enforcement in this country? </font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>Why are African Americans still dying at the hands of law enforcement in this country ? </font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>And so
are white people.</font>
< font color=#FEFF00FF>What a terrible question to ask
.</font>
And on a moral level
This victim language from the left suggests
people should feel sorry for them
If there is no such feeling
you are not a good person
This makes the right think
People on the left always speak from the moral high ground.
Always want to regulate how others feel
See same-sex marriage
You should feel happy for them
Otherwise you are homophobic
Seeing immigrants blocked at the U.S.-Mexico border
You should feel sorry for them
Otherwise you are racist
This makes the right think
The left is forcing its feelings on people
But Trump doesn’t do this
Instead, tell everyone
Immigrants and refugees are not victims
But the source of problems in American society
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Are you racist? </font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Are you a racist?</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Do you hate Mexicans? </font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>Do you hate Mexicans</font>
< font color=#FEFF00FF>The media calls us racist for wanting to build Trump's wall
. </font>
< font color=#FEFF00FF>They don’t allow
us to say</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>they censor us.</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>But it doesn't change the truth.</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF> but it doesn't change the truth .</font>
<font color =#FEFF00FF>Joe Biden's open border is killing ohioans ,
</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>with more drugs, more Democratic votes </font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>with more legal drugs and more democrat voters pouring
into this country.</font>
This makes the lower class white workers
I can finally vent my suppressed emotions from the left.
This year's election
Trump even said he would abolish the Department of Education
We need to end the politically correct "woke culture" that schools instill in students.
<font color=#FEFF00FF>We will ultimately eliminate the federal department of education</font> < font color=#FEFF00FF>We will ultimately eliminate the federal department of education</font>
< font color=#FEFF00FF>Return education to Wisconsin and back to the States .</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>and send education back to Wisconsin and back to the States .</font>
<font color=#FEFF00FF>We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our school.</font> <font color=#FEFF00FF>We will get critical race theory and transgender insanity the hell out of our school
. </font> font>
The author believes that Trump’s election campaign occasions
In fact, it is similar to what sociologist Durkheim called a "collective jubilation ceremony"
Durkheim studied Australian Aboriginal totem worship
found in ritual
The function of totem is actually just a substitute
Let people through various energy-consuming activities
to create a sense of unity
What people really worship is not a totem
It's the community that is united
Trump symbolizes the totem that unites all parties on the right
Make these people feel like they are no longer strangers in their hometown
Especially since Trump is a white male entrepreneur
It is a typical successful case of practicing the American dream.
His deputy JD Vance was born into a poor white family who was treated as white trash.
This makes many people think that they have been jumped in line
White male workers unable to move upward are encouraged
In today’s video, we introduce why the American right is on the rise
The division between the left and the right in the United States has become increasingly severe over the past half century
Capitalist globalization and automation
Many white workers in the United States are unemployed
But the right believes that the root of the problem is the public sector
The government taxes are too high
Causing companies to move factories abroad
The government should lower taxes to attract companies to return home
Instead of using taxes to help immigrants, black people, and the poor
The power of religious groups has pushed American society further to the right
The emergence of Trump has made right-wing groups feel emotionally liberated
No longer subject to the moral high ground and victim language of the left
Feel free to express all kinds of politically incorrect views
The author does not study the right in depth because she wants to promote the views of the right
But only on the basis of seeking common understanding
Only then can it be possible to reduce the extremes of political opposition
Let society find a common bridge beyond the left and right
