I think a lot of people are experiencing their leisure time by dumping their attention into their phone. And as they're flicking through Tik Tok and they're flicking through Instagram, they're thinking dopamine hit, dopamine hit, dopamine hit. And what happens sometimes when we experience a really high dopamine period is that our reserve levels, our so-called tonic levels of dopamine drop. And so we're spending all this time on our phones. We put our phone down and we're like a little exhausted. Maybe a friend texts at that very moment and says, "Hey, you want to get a drink? Hey, you want to get dinner? Hey, you want to just hang out outside the house and what populates in our head is all the various ways that the adventure of leaving our home could actually be a misadventure. I got to do my hair. Maybe I have to do my makeup. I have to find the new jeans that I want to wear. I have to travel to meet them. I might not be able to park. The subway might be delayed. It might be a boring conversation with them. I'm not so sure that I have the emotional energy to be there for my friend right now." And so all we think of is the misadventure rather than the adventure of socializing. And so we say no and instead we just go back to our phones. We are essentially dumping our dopamine, our drive into our screens rather than gifting it to other people. We're reserving our energy for glass rather than actual friendship.
