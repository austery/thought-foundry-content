[Applause] thank you very much for that very kind too kind introduction Tron it's very nice to be with you uh today and uh I'm going to share with you a framework that I often use at at Stanford University when I think about managing the Stanford endowment and it really focuses on three things that we have to do right we have to do well if we want to be successful in the long in the long run for Stanford I call them the three pillars of investment success they are strategy execution and governance so I'm going to talk about each one of those briefly and then I'll finish with uh sharing some of our long-term uh investment results with you but before I start just to orient ourselves maybe I'll I'll mention a couple high level facts about Stanford so Stanford University is a research University located in Palo Alto California about 1 hour south of San Francisco in the middle of what's sometimes referred to as silicon Valley in fact the technology ecosystem that is Silicon Valley really built itself around Stanford over the last 50 or 60 years and important companies like Google were actually uh started on the Stanford campus the University was founded in the late 1800s uh and unusually at the time it was founded as a co-educational school so the very first class that matriculated at Stanford had both men and women in it today there's 7,000 undergraduates at Stanford 10,000 000 graduate students and 2,300 faculty members the endowment as as Tron just uh mentioned is about $40 billion and this year it will distribute to the operating budget of of the University $2 billion so that is the single largest line item in Stanford's $9 billion operating budget so that brings me to the first thing that you need to do right if you want to be a successful long-term investor and that's strategy and here's a quote from the great Norwegian polar Explorer amans Victory awaits him who has everything in order people call it luck what a nice succinct way to talk about strategy you have a goal you need to build a plan a strategy to achieve your goal we have two key goals for the Stanford endowment one we want to be able to be a material part of the of the life the academic life of the current generation of students and Scholars at Stanford so I mentioned roughly $2 billion do flowing from the endowment this year it's about 5% of the value of the endowment that's goal number one goal number two is we want to be as at least as impactful and supportive for all future generations of students and Scholars at Stanford so that introduces a concept that we call the preservation of purchasing power so that just means that if you're spending 5% every year from your endowment you have to earn back at least that 5% but you'll also have to earn enough to offset the impacts of inflation the inflation that we care about at Stanford is higher education price inflation which tends to run a little bit higher than Consumer Price inflation so if CPI runs at 2 to 3% over 40 or 50 years higher education price inflation is going to run at 3 to 4% so when you put 5% of payout together with 4% inflation you you have a pretty high you need to have a pretty high uh expected return to offset uh your spending and still preserve the purchasing power of the endowment so the way that we do that is we have an equity bias in the portfolio equities have a higher expected return Then fixed income or cash and that's really important in the long run if you want to achieve that second goal unfortunately as we all know equities are very risky you rank the lowest in priority in the capital structure it's much more uh possible to lose your capital and have a capital impairment equities are also very price volatile and volatility is not not the only risk that you care about it's not even uh you know maybe not even the main risk but it is a risk and the reason that it is a risk is because unnecessary or extra volatility work will that you're not being paid for will erode your long-term compound return so to make this clear with a simple example if you start with $100 and you have a 50% return in year two and a negative 50% return sorry 50% return in year 1 and a negative 50% return in year two where do you end up well at the end of year one your $100 has become 150 and then in year two you lose 50% it becom 75 so you're up 50 down 50 but you've just lost 25% of your money so volatility erodes long-term compound returns you can see that with the identity shown on the bottom of the slide whenever volatility is greater than zero your geometric or your compound return will be lower than your single period expected arithmetic return so how do we deal with that extra risk we diversify we look for something that Noel laurat Harry Marco it's called the free lunch so we own different types of equities we own some equities in the United States some equities in Europe some equities in Asia some that are purely corporate so think of venture capital some that are backed by physical assets so think of real estate and when we put those uh equities together they are positively correlated with each other but they're not perfectly correlated so we they react somewhat differently to different macroeconomic states of the world so we're starting to gain some stability through that diversification then we introduced two other asset classes fixed income and absolute return which is a collection of carefully chosen um relative value strategies from the hedge fund world and we put them together with the equity asset classes in our portfolio we we end up with a portfolio designed to give us a pretty high expected return but with uh with uh with low levels of volatility or reasonable levels of volatility this is our policy asset allocation at Stanford right now so this is the the most succinct way that I can explain our strategy down the left hand side you can see all the major asset classes as we Define them on the right you can see their policy Target weights and everything on this slide is an equity oriented asset class except for those two middle asset classes absolute return and fixed income if you do the quick math you can see that the equity asset classes add up to about 70% of the portfolio so here you can see we're designing a strategy to achieve our goal this is an equity oriented portfolio yet it has substantial levels of diversification when we model this portfolio it gives us an expected single period return of 8.3% so that's def ated by higher education price inflation expected volatility of 15% on an annual basis and that leads to a compound return expectation of 7.11% net of net of inflation so if this is true if we designed the if we specified the portfolio correctly and we achieve a 7% real return we can pay out 5% a year or even a little bit more and still preserve their purchasing power of the Endowment for future Generations the next key pillar that we have to get right is execution and this is one of my favorite quotes from the American inventor Thomas Edison opportunity is missed by most people because it become it comes dressed in overalls and looks like work and and this really is what we do most days at Stanford management company we execute against the strategy that I just showed you so execution has a couple parts the first is portfolio management so every day we get a flash estimate of where the portfolio is comes at about 7:30 a.m. and we may start to make one of two types of actions the first is we may rebalance the portfolio between asset classes so as Market movements take those asset classes away from their policy weights the the the risk return and liquidity characteristics of the portfolio start to shift from what we think is ideal so we will normally sell what's gone up in value and bring it back down to Target and we'll buy what's gone down in value and bring it back up to Target and that way we preserve the right risk return for the portfolio going forward so that's rebalanced sometimes we rebalance once a week or once every two weeks in volatile Capital Market environments we may rebalance every day the second type of portfolio management that we conduct is rotating Capital inside of asset classes so I should take a moment and explain that the security level decisions for the Stanford endowment are made by external partners that we find we identify we try to build long-term relationships these are very specialist Partners very very good at what they do whether it's stock picking or venture capital or private real estate it's very hard to find these partners and I'll talk about that in a minute but once we have found them we have a strong trustful communication and when their opportunity set evolves we can take some action to optimize Stanford's Capital so if their opportunity set gets more attractive we can give them more money if it gets a little bit less attractive we can take some money back so we're always doing that the combination of rebalancing between asset classes and rotating capit Capital within an asset class can sometimes take up 30 40 or even 50% of the value of the endowment in a single year so they're very we're very active in managing the portfolio so I mentioned external Partners this is a really critical part of execution uh and a huge part of what we spend time on at Stanford management company these are generally speaking pretty small Niche Boutique investment firms that we find they're very principally oriented you probably wouldn't know the names of most of them um and I'll tell you what we look for when we when we when we when we go looking for new partners first of all we want to see discipline we want to see partners that understand the difference between investment and speculation understand that some things can be analyzed with a high degree of rigor and some things can't be and we want them to focus their investment work on the former and not the latter we want them to have a strong thorough and repeatable process something that we can see and feel in touch that surfaces all the hard and soft Vari that they need to think about in any given situation and then finally we wanted them to take all that data and apply Superior investment judgment that's the hardest part for us to sus out when we're meeting with a new partner um really how do they assess risk and return what kind of weights do they put on the various parts of their investment thesis and usually when we make a mistake about a partner it's usually that we we get their uh investment judgment uh wrong we like it when our partners have the appropriate amount of capital so investment success often leads people to have too much Capital they kind of outgrow their competitive Sweet Spot it's very common we'd like it when that happens that our partners return Capital to us and so it's really important that that size doesn't become the enemy of performance in our portfolio and finally we we try to structure a a strong economic alignment of Interest with our partners so are we compensating them appropriately over the right time Horizon over the right cost of capital are they putting their money alongside us uh so that we're eating the same cooking do they do well when they do well for Stanford these are all important parts of what makes a successful long-term relationship I should also mention at Stanford that we believe long-term investment success requires an appropriate regard for human and environmental welfare so we insist that our partners have that same philosophy that philosophical alignment of interest is just as important as the economic this slide sort of gives you some data on why partner selection or security selection is so important we're looking at leverage buyout funds from the United States uh formed between 2000 and 2001 and 20 2020 so these are reasonably mature buyout funds the top doed line line is the top fifth percentile buyout result for that year the bottom line is the bottom fifth percentile and the and the median is shown in the solid line in the middle so one thing immediately jumps out from the slide if you're if you're in the top of the distribution if you're in the top fifth percentile of the leverage buyout Universe in the United States you're outperforming a medium by around 20 points per year these are net annual irrs so 20 points per year on a closed in fund that's 10 or 12 years in in in life is a really is a lot of money at the end of the day so that's an incredible outcome if you can be in the top of the distribution the second thing that jumps off the slide is look at how bad you do if you're in the bottom of the distribution if you're the bottom fifth percentile you're under performing the median by 20 points per year you're almost certainly ending up with a a result that's that's uh that's below the public markets that you could access for you know very easily for low cost so this slide really um is why execution is so important if you have a complex strategy like Stanford you have to feel certain that you can be in the top of the distribution in this type of asset class I could show you similar slides for Venture Capital it would be be even more dramatic private real estate absolute return strategies all of them show this type of dispersion which means that you really need to execute well if you have the type of strategy that Stanford has how do you execute well well you have to have the right team so we uh we look for we hire people that are very intellectually curious we heard about this from some of the early speakers people that really want to continually grow as investors that seek and accept a high degree of personal accountability for their work so I often tell our analyst at Stanford management company you are the Stanford endowment I I really want them to internalize uh their work for Stanford it helps that they're motivated by Stanford's uh academic Mission this is you know it's hard work and and and and so having some psychological benefit knowing that you're doing something that is very valuable for the world is really important for the team we also try to grow our own Talent so we're often hiring right out of Stanford undergraduate uh and and training our own training our own investment professional in fact I'm joined today by my colleague TAA Rosenberg who's an analyst in our office TAA is was born and raised in Oslo she went to Stanford undergraduate and While She Was An undergraduate there uh she took our class in economics that we teach once a year and she became an intern in our office after she got her Master's Degree she joined us full-time and so it's TAA is a great example of someone who's intellectually curious seeks and accepts a high degree of personal accountability and is very motivated by Stanford's Mission we're delighted to have her on the team you take the right people and you put them in the right culture so we have a very open collaborative culture I like to think we're all in the same rowo pulling towards the same Shore we all sit on the same open floor plan we try to reduce bureaucracy we try to minimize hierarchy that's a lot better for communication it's a lot better for training your Junior professionals and it's also a lot more fun and having fun is a really important part of long-term success so the final final pillar of investment success is governance and this one is talked about less but it's just as important here's a great quote from another uh incredibly impressive Norwegian polar Explorer nonon the difficult is what takes a little time the impossible is what takes a little longer and this is a great quote about governance so governance just as important as the other two pillars and good governance supports the disciplined execution of the right strategy and this is really critically important particularly in times of Market extremes so you can think of a time of extreme Euphoria where there's some hot sector some hot asset class of the day that's dramatically outperforming everything else and by definition your Diversified portfolio will underperform that hot sector and bad governance would would say chase that sector always go with a you know try to catch up with what's performing well that's unlikely to work out well over time and certainly would entail taking a lot of risk the other type of extreme is fear and panic so think of the fall of 2008 when everybody was selling every risky asset and trying to raise cash the right thing to do in that invironment if you were an Institutional Investor was to buy the things that people were selling buy the things that had fallen 40% 50% 60% and sell the other stuff to rebalance your portfolio to bring the desired risk and return back to the portfolio on a go forward basis so governance reinforces the discipline execution of the right strategy and shelters the management team from external influences that might make that very hard okay so uh just uh to finish on this one this is our long-term investment uh results so if you had taken so Stanford management company was formed in 1991 to professionally manage the endowment if you had taken $100 in 1991 and invested it in the endowment portfolio you would have made 32 times your money by the middle of last year that's roughly double the result that you would have achieved in a in a typical uh us endowment uh fund and roughly four times uh the result that you would have achieved had you taken that same $100 and invested it in a 7030 portfolio 70% Global equities 30% high quality Bond so if you can if you form the right strategy if you specify the right strategy based on the goals that matter to you if you have the ability to execute on that strategy and then you have good governance that protects you from outside interference you can get uh attractive long-term investment results thank you very much [Music]
