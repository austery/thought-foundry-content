This year, the world has experienced extreme weather that has not been seen in a century
The high temperature in Taiwan is 38 degrees
Taiwan looks like a baked sweet potato
136 people were injured by heat in 5 days
Experts predict that within 40 years
Taiwan may not have winter
Extreme weather is already affecting Taiwan
How should we face it when we were born in Taiwan
Today we are going to face the book "Capital in the Anthropocene"
Let's talk about how the climate crisis highlights how capitalism isn't working
And how to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 through "abandoned growth"?
The book sold 500,000 copies in Japan
The author is Saito Yukihira, an internationally renowned philosophical rookie
We have done an episode of the program before to talk about what is "abandoned growth"
Today's episode is going to be specifically from a Marxist perspective
Finding a real solution to the climate crisis
Degrwoth Communism
In 2018, Nobel Laureate in Economics William Nordhaus envisioned an economic model
A carbon tax can be set to reduce CO2 most efficiently
But in this model, the tax amount cannot be set too high
Otherwise, it will hinder economic development
Economic development can bring more investment, technology
Wait until new technologies emerge in the future
solve the climate problem
Many economists share this optimistic view
But think economic growth can handle environmental disasters
In fact, it ignores the essence of capitalism
Sociologist Stephan Lessenich pointed out
European and American countries can become rich by capitalism
Precisely because they transfer the sacrifice to the outside
Offloading the environmental damage of the production process to other countries
Hiding Capitalist Exploitation of the Environment
For example, when European and American countries are enjoying fast fashion new clothes
In order to increase production, Indian farmers
Forced to use genetically modified cotton
deteriorating the local soil
Need to spend more money on pesticides, chemical fertilizers
Many farmers even commit suicide because they are in debt
In 2013, cracks appeared in the Rena building in Bangladesh, the origin of fast fashion clothing
After the workers responded, the factory asked them to continue to work
As a result, the Rena Building collapsed
More than 3,000 dead and injured
These are the prices of rich countries pursuing fast fashion
but hidden by capitalism
externalized to other countries
same
The minerals and fossil fuels that rich countries rely on are all plundered from outside
But when environmental disasters happen, the victims are countries whose resources have been plundered
year 2010
BP builds oil rig in Gulf of Mexico
The result is an oil spill
Oil pollution still affects the local marine ecosystem
2019
Vale, the world's largest mining company
Brazil's dams collapse due to overdevelopment
hundreds of people died
2020
Japan's Mitsui oil spill off Mauritius coast in Indian Ocean
local environmental emergency
These environmental accidents are not accidents but man-made disasters
because long before the event
The locals reported and responded several times
But these companies insist on mining
Why?
In order for rich countries to continue to maintain a consumer society
Replace iPhone every year
Wear designer clothes, buy high-end cars
Eat Michelin restaurants, travel everywhere
The good life that capitalism instills in us
The suffering of poor countries is hidden behind the scenes
That's why political scientist Ulrich Brand calls this the "imperial mode of living."
Globalization of capitalism is like imperial expansion
Constantly plundering external national resources
Because most of these countries are concentrated in the southern hemisphere
Therefore, it is also called the countries of the global south.
85% of the world's population lives in the South
On the contrary, only 15% of the earth's population live in northern countries (Europe, America, Japan, Australia)
But the 15% keep causing environmental harm
blame the other 85% of the planet
in the 1970s
European and American economists even threatened
Rich countries do less harm to the environment
Because they are economically advanced and have better technology
For example, the water quality and air quality in the Netherlands are better
On the contrary, developing countries such as China and India are more polluted
But actually
Improvement of natural environment in advanced countries
It is because resource extraction, industrial production, and waste disposal are all transferred to other countries
make them invisible to the damage they are doing to the environment
This is known by environmental scientists as the Dutch fallacy
This is known by environmental scientists as the Dutch fallacy
The environmental damage of capitalism is invisible
Leading to blind support for capitalism in Europe and the United States
In fact, as early as 1988
NASA scientist James Hansen has found that climate change is man-made
But his warnings went unheeded
Why?
Because it was the time when the Soviet Union collapsed
People believe that American capitalism is the most successful system
after the end of the cold war
Global carbon dioxide emissions increase
In the 21st century
Capitalism doesn't just hide environmental harm
Even “Greenwash” themselves
Publish reusable shopping bags, ban plastic straws
Starbucks is taking action to protect the environment
Starbucks is taking a step toward protecting the environment.
It may seem small,
but it could have big results.
You can also join in the action
and there are ways that you can get involved.
These environmental atonements are the self-righteous goodwill of capital enterprises
Doesn't help carbon reduction at all
Because ordinary people are not the main producers of carbon emissions at all
Straws really
are not a big problem
Given the overall amount of plastic that we throw away compared to
the total amount of plastic that people throw away.
Plastic straws account for only 0.03%
of the total plastic waste out there.
Research indicates that
Half of the world's CO2 is emitted by the richest 10% of the population
These people take private jets, drive sports cars, travel everywhere every day
by contrast
The bottom 50% of the world's poor emit only 10% of the total amount of CO2
According to the 2022 Global Wealth Report
Taiwan has a total of 870,000 millionaires worth TWD 30 million
These rich people enjoy the imperial lifestyle every day, causing a lot of carbon emissions
But keep telling the public: You have to reduce your carbon footprint!
You need to know the amount of greenhouse gases like CO2
you're responsible for creating.
Don't use plastic straws! Don't turn on the air conditioner!
But never look at the carbon footprint created by the rich and big companies
So abandoning growth does not mean that all countries stop economic growth
The culprits of warming must stop
Wealthy countries and wealthy classes
Because as long as capitalism continues to pursue economic growth
will continue to exploit the labor and environment of the southern countries
As long as the rich continue to live the empire lifestyle
will continue to produce a large amount of carbon emissions
Environmental disasters have historically occurred outside the northern states
Sacrifice the South to live the good life
So rich countries can continue to play dead and ignore climate issues
But all the countries on earth today have been exhausted
Capitalism can no longer find a new "external" to pass on its problems
Now even European and American countries cannot escape climate disasters
Because nature knows no borders
Rich countries throw their trash into other countries' oceans
As a result, the garbage turns into plastic particles, which are eaten by fish and shellfish
These seafood are sold back to Phu Quoc
The results of the study found that everyone is ingesting a lot of microplastics every week
About the size of a credit card
You don't know you eat a credit card every week
So European and American countries can no longer escape the problem
Countries began to propose countermeasures
One of the most popular is called "Green New Deal"
Trying to emulate the Great Depression in the United States in the 1930s
President Roosevelt's New Deal
Strong investment by the government to create a large number of job opportunities
Transform the country to renewable energy and popularize electric vehicles
We could use the climate crisis as an opportunity to reprogram our whole economy.
We could use it as an opportunity to reprogram our whole economy
So
it works in teh interests of both people and our planet.
What we want is a green industrial revolution.
We are talking about nothing less than a green industrial revolution.
This can both promote economic growth and protect the planet
Isn't everyone happy
Bernie Sanders (USA), Jeremy Corbyn (UK)
There are also the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) promoted by the United Nations and OECD
The idea behind it all is the Green New Deal
What we do is in our green new deal legislation
What we do is in our green new deal legislation:
This is a 5 year just transition program
a 5 year just transition program
Will guarantee the wages of workers for five years, and it is a good salary
which will guarantee them a paycheck for 5 years, good paycheck,
There is also universal health care, educational opportunities
healthcare, educational ooportuniy.
We
are not turning our back on the workers.
But the author points out
The Green New Deal is just an illusion of European and American countries washing themselves green
The principles of the Green New Deal are:
Cut off the relationship between "economic growth" and "carbon dioxide emissions"
This is called "absolute decoupling"
e.g. electric cars do not emit carbon dioxide
But selling a car increases GDP
Or replace physical meetings with online video conferences
Economic activity can be maintained without flying
This allows society to compete economically
At the same time, it produces zero carbon emissions
doesn't that sound great
The problem is to build the production process of electric vehicles, green energy technology
carbon emission
exploit the southern countries
For example, electric vehicles need lithium-ion batteries
But the lithium mines are all in the mountains of South America
Lithium mining requires local overpumping of groundwater
As a result, local shrimp and birds have decreased
There is also less fresh water available to residents
To make rich countries greener, build more electric cars
The solution turned out to be to continue to exploit the ecological environment of poor countries
People only see that the product is environmentally friendly
But I can't see the actual production process, which is not environmentally friendly
The International Energy Agency estimates that by 2040
The number of electric vehicles in the world will change from 2 million to 280 million
But only 1% reduction in carbon emissions
So the author says
"Electric cars are just a gimmick for capitalism to greenwash itself"
Green New Dealers would also say
We can invest and develop green energy
When renewable energy is cheaper than oil
The market will prefer renewable energy
Fossil fuels can be phased out using market mechanisms
The good news is
the Fossil fuel civilization's collapsing in real time.
Because the price of solar and wind are now cheaper as of this year
and the reason is the price of solar and wind are now cheaper as of this year
Cheaper than fossil fuels
, coal oil gas and nuclear.
But actually
If Home Solar Panels Really Got Cheaper
People will save money and save electricity
Use more solar panels instead
As a result, the overall power consumption will increase
Or you spend the money you save on other things
This will also increase resource consumption instead of reducing it.
This is the Jevons paradox we talked about before
And according to the logic of market competition
If the development of renewable energy makes the price cheaper
Do you think the oil industry will automatically shut down?
Petrochemical companies may seize the market
Crazier oil extraction
lower crude oil prices
The result is making the climate crisis worse
So just keep chasing economic growth
The popularization of electric vehicles and the transformation of green energy are just the opium of the people
Let the people continue to live in the illusion of happiness
Can't see the contradictions of capitalism
Only by abandoning growth can green energy transformation achieve net zero carbon emissions
After exposing the nature of capitalism and breaking the myth of the Green New Deal
The author says right now we have four options
The first is to maintain the status quo without changing capitalism
continue to pursue economic growth
The result will be "climate fascism"
Future ecological disasters could turn many into climate refugees
The state continues to side with the rich
no matter whether the people live or die
like post-coronavirus
Countries lock down cities and limit personal freedoms as they continue to pursue economic growth
Or when the epidemic spreads to the Amazon rainforest
When Aboriginal people evacuate their settlements
Former Brazilian President Bolsonaro "takes advantage of the fire"
Get companies to cut down forests
Said to revive the economy
This is typical climate fascism
The second possible scenario is climate Maoism
for more efficient environmental measures
Skip the democratic process directly
make the country more centralized
such as during a pandemic
China uses the excuse of preventing the spread of the epidemic
Limit people's gatherings
As a result, epidemic prevention has become a tool to suppress the Hong Kong democracy movement
Countries use climate issues to wield more power
The third possibility is the barbaric state
When climate crisis leads to food shortages in countries
Countries that depend on food imports face food shortages
There will be crowds looting food
The poor who can't get food will collectively rebel
could eventually lead to the disintegration of the country
Society plunged into barbarism
For example, Taiwan's food self-sufficiency rate is only 31%.
70% of food depends on imports
If climate catastrophe strikes
Taiwan may fall into barbarism
To avoid the above three situations
can not rely on the state apparatus
It is up to citizens to help each other to face the climate crisis
This is Abandoning Growth Communism
Some people hear "abandoned to grow"
I thought I was going back to live the life of a caveman
What kind of steak is this?
But in fact according to economists' calculations
just maintain the standard of living of the 1970s
sustainable ecological development
and endless economic growth
Didn't make people's lives better at all
capitalism started with the industrial revolution
claims to eradicate poverty
But are there fewer poor people in advanced countries now?
Most of the people still only receive low wages
So capitalism has always promised everyone
Economic growth brings prosperity
But half a century has passed
Millennials are poorer
Some might say I'm underpaid now
If economic growth stops, won't my salary be reduced?
Yes, if still within the framework of capitalism
In order to maintain profits, companies will
Passing on recession losses to labor
This is not called abandonment of growth, this is called economic stagnation of capitalism
Like Japan's lost 30 years
So the real key is to go beyond capitalism
Pursue growth that enriches society as a whole
etc.
How can it be possible to give up growth and make society rich at the same time?
this problem
In fact, it is the subject of Marx's research in his later years.
The author happened to be a literature expert who sorted out Marx's private notes in his later years
So next we're going to reveal
Marx's never-published notes on ecology
Marx's most famous theory is called historical materialism
Believes that the locomotive that drives human history is economic production
Marx said
Capitalism Helps Drive Global Modernization
But capitalism is paradoxical
On the one hand, constantly innovate technology and increase productivity
On the one hand, it exploits labor and pays laborers low wages
make them unaffordable
This will eventually lead to overproduction
bring economic crisis
Labor unites to overthrow capitalism amid crisis
finally build a socialist country
Labor can enjoy the fruits of economic growth
So in order to build socialism, capitalism must first develop
Make the country rich first and then engage in fair distribution
This set of historical materialism actually smuggled "productivity first" and "progressive historical view"
It implies that although capitalism exploits labor and destroys the environment
But these are only temporary side effects
In the end all it takes is a proletarian revolution
Human beings can enjoy the technology and wealth brought by capitalism
This is the end of human history
here comes the problem
Why should human history follow Europe as an example?
Marx's theory is actually very Eurocentric
When Britain colonized India and launched the Opium War against China
Marx even said: Although these things are bad
But if Asia doesn't turn to capitalism first
no socialist revolution
So for the progress of human history
Asians still have to sacrifice to be colonized by Europe first
As if European capitalism was the most advanced civilization
The rest of the world must follow
same as capitalist modernization
In the end, the whole world will move towards the communist revolution together
This is why the CCP and the Soviet Union in the 20th century were all pursuing economic growth
Because they want to catch up with European capitalism
So the postcolonial theorist Said criticized
Marx was a thorough orientalist
Believes that only European history is progressive
Asian countries have no history to speak of
But after the publication of the first volume of Capital
Marx's thought has undergone a great transformation
He came into contact with the writings of ecological scientists
The first is the "predatory agriculture" proposed by the agronomist Justus von Liebig
in a capitalist society
crops absorb soil nutrients
They were sold by peasants to the cities
Inorganic fluids of the soil are lost
but did not cycle back into the farmland
But the natural world needs time to heal itself
Capitalism breaks the laws of nature in order to increase productivity
Continue to develop before the soil has recovered its fertility
An irreparable break in the cycles of nature
This allows Liebig to predict:
Capitalist predatory agriculture could be a symptom of the collapse of European civilization
As a result, European civilization in the 20th century was not destroyed.
why?
because Marx discovered
Capitalism has three ways of deflecting problems
The first is technology transfer
Develop new technologies to overcome the crisis of capitalism
when europe was land poor
At the beginning of the 20th century, German scientists invented the "Haber process for ammonia production"
Using synthetic ammonia to produce cheap chemical fertilizers
Using technology to delay ecological catastrophe
But it's really just amplifying the disaster
Ammonia can cause groundwater pollution
Plants are also more susceptible to pests and diseases
As a result, more pesticides are required
Pesticide chemicals get into the soil and cause more harm
The second way to deal with the crisis is "spatial transfer": transfer the problem to other countries
In the 19th century, Europeans discovered a kind of struvite (guano) in South America.
Made from the poop of Peruvian seabirds
Can be used as fertilizer to solve European soil problems
For the massive introduction of struvite
Europe suppressed South American natives
Crushing 90,000 Chinese workers to pick up manure
In order to snatch the guano stone, European countries even launched a guano war
So we thought the Industrial Revolution was about exploiting European labor
But in fact, Europe can maintain soil fertility and have a stable food supply
By squeezing Chinese workers and seizing South American resources
This kind of spatial transfer is still happening today.
The avocado healthy diet recommended by European and American countries is mainly imported from Chile
But large-scale irrigation of avocados has caused water shortages and poor soil in Chile
when a drought occurs
Scarce water resources are also used to irrigate avocados
not for chilean nationals
In order to sell avocados to European and American people to eat healthy
Chileans themselves will die of thirst first
Every day someone waters the avocado trees here
So we all have water restrictions
we're going to fetch water from the truck
We don't know if the water is dry or not because we don't even know what we're drinking
The last method of capitalism to delay the crisis is "time shifting"
Carbon emissions caused by any exploitation and production of capitalism
will take decades to have an impact on the environment
That is to say
There is a time lag for the negative effects of capitalism's destruction of the environment
This allows companies to use the present time to develop resources
Let future generations bear environmental problems
It is tantamount to transferring the environmental load to the future
Liebig's theory of predatory agriculture turned Marx's thinking
I thought that as long as capitalism developed first
Then turn to socialism and distribute wealth fairly
Now Marx finds it wrong
The Prosperity of European and American Capitalism
all by plundering the resources of non-western countries
destroy their ecological environment
This allowed Marx to bid farewell to the idea of ​​productivity supremacy
And western countries do these barbaric things
Can it still be called progress?
If all countries learn from European and American capitalism
to plunder the resources of other countries
The earth will soon be over
This allowed Marx to further criticize the progressive view of history
Stop looking at European capitalism as a model of progress in human history
So what's the alternative?
Marx found the answer from the study of ancient civilizations
German agronomist Karl Fraas studies the reasons for the decline of ancient civilizations
Discover the civilizations of ancient Sumeria, ancient Egypt, and ancient Greece
All because of excessive deforestation, making agriculture unsustainable
Areas of ancient civilizations that now look extremely dry
It used to be full of vegetation
The supremacy of productivity did not bring about the prosperity of civilization, but led to its demise
But before the fall of civilization
There is a small group of people who are aware of environmental problems early
left the civilized country
Go out yourself and create a small community
Like the manor system in ancient Rome
It is a small number of nobles who own large tracts of land
Exploiting slaves to plow the fields
Ancient Rome finally declined due to overexploitation
But the ancient Germanic peoples who practiced permaculture survived
Establishment of the "Mark Community" (Markgenossen) in rural areas
This community stipulates that the land does not belong to anyone
Land sales are also not allowed
In order to prevent someone from encroaching on the most fertile land
Members will regularly draw lots to replace land use rights
So you may live in Da'an District this year
Next year, we will draw lots and move to Wenshan District
Everyone has an equal opportunity to live in a different area
so that people will not develop and abuse the land arbitrarily
Equal shared land itself brings sustainable development
unlike capitalism
The landlord only needs to buy a piece of land
You can develop and stockpile land at will
Waiting for land appreciation
Widening inequality and damaging the environment
Moreover, this Mark community also stipulates
Products produced in the community are not allowed to trade with outsiders
This makes people and nature's material metabolism always cycle on the same piece of land
Originally Marx believed that the ancient rural community was a symbol of backwardness and isolation
But now I finally understand
In fact, the rural community deliberately does not develop the land
Deliberately not pursuing economic growth
To prevent someone from getting rich from trading with outsiders
make society unequal
So Marx said
These rural communities of equals are "unconscious socialism"
if more equal than anyone
They are actually more progressive than capitalist society
So it's the Europeans who have to learn about equality from the rural communities of non-Western societies
This allowed Marx to find a new foundation for communism:
after the end of capitalism
Instead, a community of equals similar to ancient society
But not going back to the past and living a primitive life
but at a higher level of civilization
Emulate the spirit of equality that humans once had in the past
On the one hand, absorb the science and technology of the development of capitalism
On the other hand, it captures the growth mindset of the rural community
This is why the Soviet Union and the CCP are not communism at all as Marx envisioned
Because they are still chasing economic growth
Still creating inequality
The real communism must be the abandonment of growth communism
now we have seen clearly
to deal with the climate crisis
Must stop imitating European and American capitalism
Began to turn away from growing communism
But how do you actually do it?
We must rebuild the public goods taken away by capitalism
Historian Andreas Malm points out
Before the Industrial Revolution, Britain originally had traditional hydroelectric waterwheels
Hydropower is environmentally friendly and cheap
because there are rivers everywhere
Coal is actually more expensive and rarer in comparison
Then why did capitalists choose to invest in coal and steam engines?
Because coal creates artificial scarcity
make energy scarce
If the source of power is a country waterwheel
The countryside is full of rivers
water is free
Then labor is rarer and more valuable than energy
This will increase wages
bad for capitalists
But if the source of power is changed to steam engine, coal
can gather workers in cities
More labor, but less coal
Energy will become more expensive and labor will become cheaper
In this way, the relationship between capital and labor is completely reversed.
So the industrial revolution was actually the result of capitalists deliberately switching from water power to fossil fuels
So you can monopolize the energy supply and make more money
You didn't have to pay at all when you used to generate electricity with hydropower
post industrial revolution
People need to spend money to get energy
So people are actually getting poorer
But it was covered up
Because when you pay the electricity bill in the currency issued by the state
GDP will grow
So just looking at GDP, you would think that the country is getting richer
This is why after the industrial revolution
High GDP growth in European countries
But people's lives have not improved
This is called the Lauderdale Paradox
As private wealth (GDP) increases, public wealth decreases
same
Today's US health care is privately run
People have to pay high medical expenses when they get sick
So you actually get poorer when you get sick
But these medical expenses will increase the country's GDP
Create the illusion of a country's wealth
U.S. insists on not implementing universal health care
It is because capitalism pursues economic growth
We can't let privatized health care become a public good
Capitalism first denies taking away public wealth
So now Marx says
Let's deny capitalism one more time
rebuilding the commons that humanity once had
This negation of negation is communism
So how do we rebuild public goods in the 21st century?
First of all, we must first confirm what things are necessary for human life
Like utilities, education, housing, medical care
We can't live as human beings without these
Only these basic needs are met first
Only then can talents have the leeway to pursue free development
Engage in creation, develop culture, make friends, fall in love
Human potential can be fully realized
people will feel real freedom
And human freedom is the goal of communism
So how do we manage public money?
Certainly not managed by capital firms
Nor should it be run by the national government
Otherwise, a technocratic tyranny could emerge
Like nuclear power plants that only a few people know about
But obviously electricity is needed by everyone
should be collectively managed by all citizens
For example in 2019
Copenhagen decided to build an urban orchard
Allow citizens to adopt public fruit trees free of charge
This is actually a revival of the public wealth that Europeans once had 500 years ago.
It was only privatized by capitalists after the enclosure movement in the 16th century
We can also turn businesses into public goods
let workers share
That is, the concept of labor cooperatives
For example, the well-known Mendela Cooperative in Spain is a successful case
What laborers have to do is not follow orders from their bosses
It is about discussing together and deciding together what to produce and how much to produce
It's like bringing democracy into the company
This kind of labor cooperative is what the economist Piketty calls "participatory socialism"
Building this labor cooperative from the bottom up
It is the key to realizing growth-abandoning communism
Finally, the author puts forward five suggestions for turning to abandoning the growth of communism
The first is that production must turn to use value
Commodities have two attributes: use value and transaction value
For example, a house can be used for living, which is the use value
It can also be used as an investment
enhance its transaction value
Capitalism only cares about maximizing the value of goods
regardless of use value
Abandoning growth communism is all about directing production towards what society really needs
For example, care work: Nursing, preschool teachers, doctors and nurses
the work of these people
truly contribute to society
without harming the environment
The opposite of
We should eliminate a lot of unnecessary shit work
like marketing, advertising, packaging
These tasks not only waste resources
It also encourages unnecessary consumer behavior
because the business knows
I can't sell what I produce
Just spend more budget on advertising
Get people to buy things they don't need
At the same time we must shorten the working hours
Capitalism keeps improving technology
Resulting in unemployment of workers, being replaced by AI automation
But unemployment creates political unrest
So governments will want to keep unemployment low
Then we must expand the scale of economic production
Make labor do things that AI can't
This results in an increase in resource consumption
If you want to achieve growth, you must shorten the working hours
If the working hours are shortened
work is still boring shit
still feel dehumanized
Marx thinks
Labor should feel self-fulfilling
To achieve this the division of labor must be abolished
Because the division of labor makes labor fragmented
People can only develop a part of the ability
like a city guy working in an office
farmer working in the field
Knowledge workers only use their brains
Those who work physically can only use their hands
So Marx said that in a real communist society
A person can hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, and read and criticize in the evening
Instead of being limited to the division of labor of fishermen, hunters, and philosophers
The last is to abandon growth and pursue the democratization of the production process, which can slow down society
Why capitalism is efficient
Because the boss only needs to think about how to make more money
But if transformed into a labor cooperative
will definitely lead to slower efficiency
Because we need to discuss what to produce and how to produce
democratic communication
But slower production is helping the planet
Because of this, the speed of resource consumption will also slow down.
So the democratization of business can not only stop the exploitation of labor
can also slow down the exploitation of nature
In today's episode we introduce what is "abandoning growth communism"
past 500 years
capitalism's ever-expanding empire model of life
Looting of natural resources to the global south
Then shift the burden of environmental damage to these countries
Let people in advanced countries continue to dream of economic growth
Propose a green new policy and invest heavily in green energy industries
but cannot see the invisible and exploited southern countries
To achieve climate justice, we must rebuild the public wealth taken away by capitalism
Replace Capital Enterprises with Democratic Labor Cooperatives
Let the society achieve real prosperity
When we turn the things we need in life into public goods
We don't have to work every day to die
Just to pay next month's rent, student loan, and living expenses
There will be more free time to start the life we ​​want
You might think that sounds too utopian
But a study by Harvard political scientist Chenoweth found that
All kinds of changes in human history actually have a critical value
As long as 3.5% of people stand up, society will have a huge change
these are not theories
It's a reality that's already happening around the world
Citizens of Barcelona launch climate emergency declaration in 2020
Municipal reform driven by citizen autonomy
Collectively rebuild water, electricity, housing and various public properties taken away by capitalism
Today, more than 50,000 people are working in labor cooperatives
Adhere to local production and local consumption, and give back to community members
This action seems to be rebuilding the equal community of the ancient countryside in contemporary society
Barcelona's reform drive aligns with global South
Connected to 77 cities in the world
Share action strategies and ecological knowledge against local companies with each other
Western societies begin to learn from the Global South
We are facing an important turning point in human history
Many cities around the world are thinking about how to move beyond capitalism
now is the time
Taiwanese society should join this wave of reform together
Before extreme weather brings civilization to its knees
Turning Abandoned to Grow Communism
Realize social prosperity for all citizens
