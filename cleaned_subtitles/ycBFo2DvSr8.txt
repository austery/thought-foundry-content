[Music] so today we are very excited to welcome one of the most impressive leaders in global Finance sagio erot CEO of UBS which is one of the biggest banks in the world saio LED UBS from 2011 until 2020 but he recently made a dramatic return after the historic acquisition of the main rival credit twiss but first Serio will uh go all the way back and talk about uh you know when you were uh even younger you were a talented football player so how come you ended up in banking I wasn't so talented obviously so I guess uh well my dream was definitely I would have swapped until today probably playing a final of the World Cup and scoring a goal uh with my current job for sure so I guess my dream as a young person was definitely to be a uh professional football player then and but then I in Switzerland you know we we could go through you know an education system that allows you to go through an apprenticeship so I started uh in banking as a plan B you know to the football career and so when it turned out that I wasn't good enough to be a football player or a professional one at least then I uh opted for becoming being a Trader and so my career in banking started yeah well I would argue you've got you've scored quite a lot of goals but it's just that it's being in finance rather than football but what happened you got a um a very important position you were only 27 years old yeah that was probably uh the defining uh one of the defining moments in my career because uh back then I went through an apprenticeship I stayed in Lugano the south of Switzerland uh and I I did a master in in banking and then I was hired by City Bank to be a Trader for convertible bonds and options and and so on and I did it for 18 months and then I got the the famous offer you can't refuse from from uh from Mar Lynch which was not necessarily Financial was the ability or the opportunity to to build up their Swiss frank Capital Market operation in Switzerland 1987 so basically from scratch was almost no office no no telephone so and me and another two or three colleagues you know myself as one of the the two leader took on the embarking to this journey of building from scratch at the swis Frank operation that eventually got bigger we went to the stock exchange we got a banking license and that was a a fantastic Journey so I was training during the day in the evening sorting out you know how to manage the back office and how to manage the entire operation something totally Unthinkable today and that was a defining experience because I I I learn how to manage how to build up a business how to you know look at different uh ways of uh being you know a leader and and still being why would that be Unthinkable today because today I would say the regulatory environment is completely different governance around large organizations is completely different so giving a to a 27 years old person uh mandate to build up such a business was a probably uh uh yeah I think is Unthinkable today most likely yeah fast forward to 19th of March 20123 when UBS agreed to buy credit Swiss there was a big big turbulence in the market in the week up to this now what did you what did you think well seeing this from the sideline in a way at that stage yeah some kind of interested because I I I even back then I was a a chair of swissy uh and uh but also the facto as a as a banker or a former Banker I felt you know very sorry for seeing that you know situation developing and and uh and uh but I I have to say that I never thought that it would hand so dramatically right over you know of course you know until Wednesday the Wednesday before the weekend there that day when I heard um that the Swiss fed Council was uh in an emergency U um session that I understand I understood that something must be pretty bad and actually I knew that the weekend would turn out into something so almost impossible that they make such announcements on special sessions of the federal Council without something meaningful uh coming and there uh so I uh but I I have to say that uh the the speed at which things uh developed was was uh somehow tragic and and surprising now this was in a way the biggest fault since Lon Brothers right so how shocked were you to be fair I think that uh we recognize I recognize uh for many years that maybe c s didn't have a sustainable business model uh and uh and in that sense I was surprised that they waited for so long to take a radical decision and as time went by particularly after their Capital increase in in in in October that didn't really you know go through well with investors not only in terms of the placement of the stocks but you know the strategy I I thought that they would try to find a buyer or to do a break up or do something's radical so uh basically to let that external factors like the regional banking crisis would force them somehow to you know to to have to take actions uh uh was a little bit surprising and uh but you know I think it was the bank and and and potentially even other actors I mean they were probably not uh on top of the situation for for too long I think Switzerland did a pretty good job during the weekend uh to avoid a Leeman alike crisis because I think that one has to also put into the context that at least the lessons learned from the financial crisis has created uh plans Capital buffers and uh that would not translate into a an impossible mission for a private solution to happen and also which is our Theory and that is proven a wind down of credit swis would have not costed the taxpayer any money but of course he would have created a lot of turmoils and uncertainties in the market because the question would have been very quickly was next right so so what happens during a weekend like that I mean this is not an ordinary weekend I mean what happens in a country who yeah but for me you know I'm I was I was still a half Observer absolutely but you were still you I mean3 is a is a is a very significant power in the financial industry yeah but in in a weekend like that where everybody gets together to solve a crisis what is what is happening specifically yeah it was interesting because uh yeah from Wednesday onward I started to get phone calls from you know former colleagues or or competitors of the banks right the banks uh from people in the industry actually asking me what I thought about the situation we were of course debating And discussing and then uh during the weekend you know I I also got uh some phone calls um um in during the process but I not from the UBS part but uh as a you know there was a a consideration about developing uh other plans so uh so I was somehow during the weekend prepar that something would would happen and yeah I think that's what you what you saw is that the facto uh uh very rapidly uh the private Solutions developing as the most viable one the one that would create certainty developing and so uh I have to say that Sunday afternoon when I heard that UBS was uh basically chosen as the solution I was somehow relieved because I felt that uh you know having a public uh uh solution would have been quite damaging uh not the right thing to do and uh so and then things uh stayed quiet for few hours until Monday morning and then I got a phone call from from the German from the German yeah and what did he say yeah I said that we we uh he told me we need to talk uh and so I suspected was not probably just having a beer or just asking my uh advice it could have been because we but uh then we decided to meet on Tuesday and uh and after a few minutes it got pretty clear on the reason for for the meeting what did you think well of course I was uh you know on one end uh I felt like uh yeah the Temptation uh was a sense of uh of loyalty to UBS uh kind of Call of Duty also to the to the country uh you know I was I felt honored that people were thinking about me on the other hand you know I had to find my own motivation so and uh my own motivation that I thought and I still believe today that you know out of something that is definitely not ideal and quite tragic we can do something great and eventually something that can create longlasting value for for shareholders but also for clients and employees of the of because you know on one end you know may for many of the credit Swiss employees was an Agony in the last few years and I think that uh for the UBS employees we now have a even stronger competitive position uh more Diversified business our clients will benefit and I do think also shareholders will benefit over time so I felt okay there is we think so too by the way yes good but there there was also a motivation for me to do something that was quite transformational and uh for the industry and uh and therefore um so I got a good motivation so it took me 48 hours to to think about who did you speak to who do you take advice from well the I I think I I spoke to my wife uh but after a few seconds she told me but it looks like you're looking at my face she thought she felt I already decided as I was talking to her but uh no honestly I I uh I a couple of friends uh I spoke to uh but uh you know I have to say that none of them told me don't do it everybody was quite uh convinced that I should should follow m but you you had been very successful at UBS and now going back and taking on something which is you know in part risky right what did you what did you think about that you know that was probably the the really deciding uh moment because I made a very simple analysis the reason I mentioned to you this the the sense of uh duty to UBS uh uh and and and and to Switzerland played a role in making me feel like if I say no and things don't turn out well not that I think I can resolve every problem to be honest but I would feel somehow Corr responsible for not not having the guts or being egoistic about not doing it for whatever my own reasons right so so I felt I could not really feel comfortable about being in that situation and then on the other end I felt that if it turns out to be a success like I believe it is I would feel stupid for not having do it so I said I have no choice I had absolutely no choice I had to do it so because I would feel most likely bad about any of the two scenario so the likelihood that we're going to be an on event is very low so I think that's uh in that sense uh that was my rational for taking the decision and this sense of Duty for your country where does that come from you think probably because we as the southern part of Switzerland the Italian part of Switzerland is a minority so it's probably also the first time that somebody from the south of Switzerland has such a important uh position I don't know I don't know is a good question I I do believe that there is I love this but I do believe there has to be some kind of uh sense of standing and demonstrating uh to the rest of the country that that we we can we are also so did you do it did you do it on behalf of the Italian minority in Switzerland yeah no no no no I did it because I believe no I I mean fundamentally I think Switzerland is a is living out of diversity between cultural diversity the German 23 of Switzerland we are only 300,000 people out of uh eight and a half n million people so definitely a minority but uh but still the with the French people we have a very cohesive way of looking at it but of course you know if you ask me my spontaneous reaction is this one probably was uh something that I feel uh uh you know I can also can also contribute to that now um what did you do during the first weeks back at UBS how do you uh enter a situation like that well first of all I have to say that it was quite surreal how things developed so quickly I found myself into into into my office uh old office within a week uh in the bank within 48 hours or you know basically we announced it on the 29th of March so basically the next morning I was in the bank and uh and uh it it was so intense that I had to focus on the priorities the priority was okay what what do we need to do to stabilize uh uh the clients what do we need to do to stabilize the employees what needs to be done to to really start to you know uh develop uh the integration plan what are the priorities uh I had to start to consider okay with the team that is going to uh be with me uh and and and one of the first priority for me from the very beginning was okay I need to fully understand what kind of risk we took on what is the liquidity position of the company Bank not only for risk management but because my first priority I told the board was we need to repay as quickly as we can the emergency liquidity support of the government and we need to return the guarantee on the portfolio that was uh uh selected as a potentially problematic uh as soon as possible and that was my number one priority and why is that so important to pay that by quickly because that was in my point of view once we would determine that we have the strength and the ability to absorb any of the excess risk that we uh would find and then we are in control of that that would be the ultimate way to reassure um our stakeholders clients and in general you know our employees and and and the rest of of the community in which we operate so the ability to say okay we took over we are in control we can do it with our own Capital our own liquidity for me was the the ultimate thing that we were comfortable about our due diligence so it took uh uh three four months to do that right so to to to come but for me was almost very clear from the very beginning after a couple a couple of three four weeks I you know I realized that we we would have a good chance to to do that you said that it was clear to you that credit F didn't have a sustainable business model what do you how could you see that what what do you mean by that in a very easy way it's very simple there is nothing more dangerous than a large bank or a bank not making money or losing money that should be in mind there is no Capital no liquidity no no matter what do you think if you have a bank that is either not covering its cost of capital or even worse losing money then you know that something is wrong but in in in essence for me when you have a a a Wealth Management Center business an asset Gathering let's call it right Centric business with a strong position in the Universal banking Market in Switzerland if you are not able to pay for your cost of capital then you know there is a problem and that was the case but what was the problem I mean why were they not making money because they were allocating too much Capital to the Investment Bank yeah below and with returns below their cost of equity and uh because they were still relying too much on taking uh or or using credit uh as a lever to go into business relationship including wealth management which is not bad for per se but you know if you are a wealth management or an asset Gathering Centric organization Landing is a tool that you give to clients you know to comp Le your offering is not the tool that you get in order to get into business and and and you know Cru is very strong c as very good people very good products very good capabilities and was seen over the last uh centuries and the last decades as a entrepreneurial bank so but in a sense it become way too entrepreneurial and way too risk-taking in order to accommodate clients that over time it lost completely the disciplines on risk reward and return on Capital what was the moral like what was the moral like in the workforce there when you took over definitely a lot of disappointment a lot of angry people a lot of a lot of people that were you know for different reason you know the one that uh that they were absolutely not uh comfortable with losing their identity as as an organization the one that were totally pissed off because they lost a lot of their money uh in different you know uh and uh and so on and so forth so the one that were absolutely uh uncomfortable with the idea now all of a sudden to be in the same house as the one they've been fighting at for for years and years so was a mix I think it's probably difficult to imagine from the outside because you've been competing for how many years I mean crit with and uh and 170 years 170 years right on on one on each Corner in every town in Switzerland right yeah and then suddenly you are going to be friends and family yeah it's not it's not yeah but my analogy I'm telling to people is to say fine we we have been fighting to for for the national championships now we are the Swiss national team and we need to play for the bigger games and therefore that's a new Mission so I mean uh I mean the reason we thought Al so attractive the situation is because it's a kind of merger you can never do in peace time but look in banking all the mergers that creates any value are coming at moments of stress yeah look back at US Banks you look back how they got now into their position it's all about them being allowed or being asked during the financial crisis to grab or put together banks that were about to fail or they were failing and so on and so forth so so and financial crisis they come every so often so it's the waiting game right yeah so the issue is that it's a Pity that it takes a crisis to create something that makes sense but that's a reality by the way you know that a lot of m& fails not because the industrial logic is not there not because the financial logic is not there not because blah blah blah but because of chemistry of people not agreeing on governance or or their own roles so it's a Pity and then during a crisis there is a winner and loser and therefore that kind of emotions goes out of the equation and that's the reason you have the deals so now we are one year later what are your priorities at this stage phase one was the integration the biggest priority right now is to go into the merger of the operating entities so-call parent company Banks UBS AG credit Swiss AG you can imagine we have credit Swiss is bringing around 600 legal entities is into the UBS framework so we need to mer good time for Swiss lawyers moving on a bit what is it about Switzerland and banking It's a combination first of all had completely changed and evolved in the last 30 40 years when I started my career at 15 was uh all based on banking secrecy and uh and discretion and uh and now is it's all about having Professional Services uh I would say it's a combination of of that but also uh the reliability of of the Swiss political system uh the kind of neut it's not really the neutrality it's more about the stability of the political and and uh the rule of law that allows people the strengths of the Swiss rank as as a currency also gives a lot of confidence to people so I think it takes a lot of uh um you know um uh re reasons to get why Switzerland is as big as you know it is uh U punching well above its weight but not only in banking I if you look at Pharma you look at Food you look at Innovation the universities Switzerland is a country that punches well above its weights yeah why is that you think I I think the fact that we invest a lot in in education I mean at the end of the day we have a pretty flexible and Dynam IC labor market and a very good education system which are the prerequisite if you want to be successful in uh nowadays one other thing that I think is interesting is just since I started to work in finance in London uh us investment banks have pretty much wiped away so much of the European competition why why do you think that is so during the financial crisis the facto U with all the uh the constraint and the Lessons Learned us Regulators put on their US Banks one thing they made it clear they wanted US Banks to continue to be or to be uh the leading Force going forward in in in in in the financial services industry and so they allow them to grow Europe did the contrary Europe did everything they could have done to uh to don't allow uh Banks to be uh bigger or successful so and and and the fragmentation of Europe also from a political not political but I would say a regulatory and SL political standpoint of view without a capital Market Union without a banking Union has prevented the creation of strong and alternative uh players uh so the reason why we are now emerging as a uh uh David versus goolia is because we are a more capital L we we are able to uh you know of course the Swiss business is very profitable but it's a 9 million people country so it's it can really be as big as any major countries but because our strength is the the wealth management asset Gathering angle so few few other banks in Europe can do that but I do think that uh there is a a political uh uh desire to not allow Banks to become too big still a lot of parochial thinking in Europe about being big Banks so each each wants to have their own national champions forgetting that winning the the national championships doesn't take you very far in terms of global same same with Airlines yeah how how important has the Cora culture of UBS been and what is I mean how would you define the corpa culture UBS versus other Banks I think that we try to be very clear to our people and uh it's funny because when I started in 2011 2012 I was confronted with a lot of uh uh criticism by external people even internally about where the culture of the bank banks in general the culture of the bank not not good culture blah blah blah so I try to really say but is it true is it true that we don't have a culture and when I started to look bottom up and top down what we stand for I realize that we had clearly some common uh commonalities and things that we could build on so what we did is to really make a big differentiations between okay now we look at people in terms of not only compensation but promotions in scoring uh alongside what people do and how they achieve their results and giving two scores making sure that in order to be a successful leader or member of the team going forward you can be just great in one or the other you need to be good at both you've said that um we need teamwork but we cannot be friends all the time what do you mean by that well friends are not I mean I take my analogy from Sports and when I was playing young I mean it's not like every teammate was a friend but uh you know but we had to have one thing in common we wanted to win the game and we wanted to make sure that all the people on the pitch would follow and give 100% so so that's what I mean is that H we need to have common understanding of what we stand for and our goals and and uh we need to leave out the more emotional part the Friendship part if it comes it's good I mean my God I mean it's absolutely better to have it that way and in some cases it can be also dangerous because you know when when you develop too deep of a personal relationship at work it may over time be a conflicting element that doesn't allow you to be uh a credible leader uh an unbiased leader so you have to pay attention all the time how how you balance the two the two factors but of course you know I can tell you that uh what I saw in the US is I don't know if you heard that anecdote is fantastic uh a colleague of ours uh was uh lost for the second time his kidney and so he needed desperately to find a second one and he got a group of UBS people volunteering to donate the kidney wow so it must be that something's there developed Beyond being just a colleague right so and you know I have nothing against that but of course it's not something that we should force as an organization no you have been tasked also to find your own successor how do you go about doing that well it's not really I'm part of the process like I was last time the responsibility is for the board and it's it's really premature because right now I mean I made a commitment and the board wants me to to stay till the integration is over so very minimum the end of 2026 and then early part of 2027 and I think that you know it's it's part of of of my job the COO job to be to offer a numbers of candidates right so one has to be realistic nowadays to to have more than two or three credible candidates is not easy how do you well why is it not easy yeah because I mean you got how many how many thousand people have you got in the bank now no but that's exactly the point is is because no matter I mean as you as as you go up uh I'm sure you appreciate that you have maybe a lot of very talented people a lot of specialized people so it's not easy to find the people that can then take a broader and more complete um understanding of the business and and you know it's not just a technical issues also there is the uh the leadership uh the emotional leadership uh the knowledge uh the ability to leave with stress uh the ability to make decisions so you narrow down that you know when you go down in the organization you can have extremely you know talented people and and and and and great professionals but it's not always easy to then translate all of them into uh broad leaders for a more complex business so how do you how do you develop them for me the most important issue which I took from my days at Mar Lynch 17 years uh is is to really force myself as a uh as a the manager and and and force also every each of us to number one think about what else can a person do in the organization so one of the things which I think is is good in my team that a big number of the team members of the executive board could do another job in the executive team so fungibility is very important so be successful in your business but how much and and what we can do we have to do we have to push people at in any level on the organization to move around to do other experiences because I think at the very least they broaden up their Horizons at the very least you incentivate cross collaborations in the organization but eventually as time goes by you develop better managers better more rounded managers how long time is how long time does it take to develop a good leader defining good leader for what t ask to take over UBS 20 years that's exactly the the same number as James Gman uh said yeah okay but it's very simple it's justes no but it's just you take 20 you start let's say meid 20 you start and you say okay you know when you get into a level of matureness and then is mid 40s early 50s so it takes around that age but do do companies actually start that early I mean how many companies do that the you we went we went well I I remember M they were almost at a point in time doing even too much of moving people around so you can argue that there is a value in in in in stability uh in many cases I found that it's more difficult for in in when you go down in the organizations uh managers at lower levels are very protective of their best people so are not so Keen to see them going somewhere else in in the organization so what I try to do not as successfully as I want yet but I still we are making some good inroad is to force both the manager and the employee to mention two jobs they would want to do outside their comfort zone so in order to uh to avoid uh the feeling that as an as as an employee or subordinate you are not loyal to your boss when you say that you would like to do something else I force the manager also to say what do you think that person should do right and how of you doing that well we try to put it into our HR System and then now you know also using more more and more the CVS uh the artificial intelligence screening when we look at CVS and we look at uh uh open positions so we try to leverage that one also in a way that when we have a talented person that says they would like to do something else when we say okay it's time to force in some cases I force myself I force people to take unconventional views on on new appointments taking talents from other part of the bank uh so I did it few times in in in my first 10 years what makes you in effective leader I would say at the end of the day the effective leader is the one that's leads by examples and doesn't abuse The Authority versus the uh so you can get away with uh managing without Authority so I mean I'm not asking people to do things that they don't see me doing and number two I'm using very selectively Authority so I try to to make sure that people smells the coffee before um before I have to say that I want something right so and by doing that usually you get more tractions and results and tell me a bit more about how you when you choose to use your Authority and when you don't what is what other the situations in general when I lose my patient and and it's is when I think that debate debates and you know goes on forever without any meaningful outcome then I step and use more of the authority right is that the Italian blood I saw many nordics thinking that way in my in my so it's not so what's been the most challenging leadership decision you made after you came back decision yeah well it's a little bit of a delicate question to be honest uh but it's always around people yeah the most delicate and most complex are always around people people the one you is you know the one thing I I learned is that uh eventually it's always in my career the regret is not having taken not necessarily just always negative also positive not having on board the the right person earlier than I uh than I could or should have or or or letting certain people in the job longer than I should have you know the biggest regret but regret that help me in any case to develop is always mainly around people rather than through business uh decisions you mentioned that um coping with stress was an important feature of being a good CEO how do you cope with stress by trying to protect my weekends with family social activities skiing um I I am the the president of a small football club in the village where I live in tachino in Lugano so you haven't given up football totally no no no I can't least watch it and um I ski a lot in Winter um so I I really try to protect uh so I rarely rarely don't go home on Friday evening right so I for me is very very important not to mix uh the weekends and uh and and switching off also physically what I do is really literally I don't stay in Zur or I always go to ski or in gadin or I go to uh the beach with my wife or I I stay in Lugano but I don't stay a lot in Zur during the weekend because but you manage to take the whole weekend off Saturday and Sunday not the full weekend you mean not touching emails not no it's almost impossible right but it's a different way to work when you're home over the weekend what um we have um tens of thousands of young people listening to this what would be your advice to young people well look the advice is always the same in my point of view first of all you know it goes without saying and probably the new generation don't need too much of that advice but you know just you have to be passionate for what you do I mean you know I never really did anything because I wanted to be a CEO right I mean first of all you must be quite sick if you think about early on your you I want to be a my maybe is a is a dream but it's very few people make it so you need to work and enjoy what you do and be successful and over time maybe a career comes if you just work to for having a career or for the money it's not going to be very uh very very nice so be passionate about what you do I remember when I was very young I was waiting for the Monday to go back into the bank and and Tra and being and trading right and for me that was a passion and the second one I would say uh be flexible and Mobile in terms of uh uh making experiences outside your comfort zone particularly the physical one it's very easy today you know you always have an excuse uh boyfriend girlfriend whatever you have uh uh uh your your your comfort zone but you know making international experiences going out and work somewhere else and in a in an uncomfortable Zone you know having to learn a new language having to do something that challenges you uh it's it's very is very important to to to develop uh the personality and also potentially also from a professional standpoint of view it goes without saying that the last things I I do say I don't know about in uh constantly to our people at UBS we invest a lot of money in uh in keeping our people up to speed with the best uh developments uh to to train them to educate them we have plenty of courses and but the first one once needs to do investment in in itself is is the person don't rely on on the state don't rely on your company to make you a competitive person in the labor market rely on yourself yeah we can help you we can support you but don't rely on us well soio you um for sure have relied on yourself you have shown huge passion in in UBS and in your country and for sure you've shown agility by and flexibility by coming back for a second stunt so big congratulation and it's been wonderful to talking to you thank [Music] you
