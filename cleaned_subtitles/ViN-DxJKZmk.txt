Philosophy is so refreshing, it makes you so happy
Each episode introduces you to a philosophical thinker
In the last video we introduced Descartes
In this episode we are going to introduce the philosophers who were contemporary of Descartes
Spinoza
Spinoza was one of Einstein's most admired philosophers
Einstein once said he believed in Spinoza's God
In today's episode we will explain
What does Spinoza’s God mean?
Spinoza was born in Amsterdam in 1632
His parents are Jewish businessmen
importer of nuts
Spinoza grew up studying in a Jewish community
regarded as a child prodigy
Many believed he would grow up to become an intellectual leader (rabbi) in the Jewish community
Later his brother and father died one after another
He and his second brother will inherit the family business together.
called barton gabriel spinoza
But Spinoza had no interest in business
He said: "A life that pursues financial success is just vanity."
I'm going to search to see what brings the deepest joy
He studied Latin under van den Enden, a famous philosopher at the time.
This was the common language of European intellectuals at that time
This Enden often holds philosophical salons in his home
Give Spinoza access to cutting-edge ideas
like Descartes philosophy
But at the age of 23
Something big happened suddenly
Jewish Church Proclamation
Because of his evil words and deeds, Spinoza was to be excommunicated from the church
The Inquisition accused him of saying:
Spinoza said that the Jews were superstitious and ignorant
Don't know what God is
Still claiming to be God’s chosen people
No wonder they are looked down upon by other countries
Superstition refers to the belief in the immortality of the soul, the laws of the Bible
After his expulsion, Spinoza remained calm
I think this is better
But Jewish business relies on connections within the Jewish community.
Not being welcomed by the Jewish community means losing these connections.
Spinoza could no longer engage in business
So after a few years he moved to a small village called Rijnsburg
Specializes in polishing lenses for a living
Spinoza's home has now been renovated into a former residence
If you go to the Netherlands, you can visit it
His philosophical work "Ethics" was written here
However, the manuscript of "Ethics" was not published after it was completed.
Spinoza went off to write another book, the Tractatus Theologico-Politica
Talk about protecting freedom of thought
In today’s video, we will first introduce “Ethics”
The next video will introduce "Theology and Politics"
Spinoza’s Ethics first explores the question of God
At that time the philosopher wanted to know
What is the most fundamental existence in the universe?
That is to find something that can survive independently without relying on other things.
This is called a substance
For example, Descartes believed that God is an entity
Because God needs nothing else to sustain His existence
A horse is also an entity
Danma's existence depends on God's guarantee
If God wants, he can make the horse disappear in the next second
So the horse is just a finite entity
God is the infinite entity
Spinoza now follows Descartes' definition
but came to a completely different conclusion
Horses cannot be called entities
Because horses need food and grass to survive
What if one day all the food in the world disappears?
Horses become extinct
So horses don’t exist independently.
People are not entities anymore
You need to rely on your parents to give birth to you
And then your parents have to rely on their parents
Can push back infinitely
Therefore, it is impossible for everyone to exist independently
Finally, even the concept of life
It also requires reliance on inanimate concepts to understand
In the end we will find
Nothing in the universe can exist independently
Because everything in the universe is interdependent
So there is actually only one entity in the entire universe
The whole universe is "one"
Everything we see is just "one" expanded into different forms
Just like a piece of clay that can be molded into various shapes
But these shapes rely on clay to exist
So Hegel said
Anyone who thinks about entities
Everyone will find that what Spinoza said is right
The only thing that can exist independently is nature itself
Now comes the problem
If nature is an entity
Then I would like to ask, is God inside or outside this nature?
The prevailing view at the time was that
God is eternal and infinite
But everything in nature is limited
Therefore God must be independent from nature
Now Spinoza says it's not right
Since the entire nature is an independent and self-existing entity,
And the definition of God is also an independent and self-existing entity.
Then nature and God are actually the same thing
God is nature
This concept seemed incredible to people at the time
Because people think that God must be outside nature in order to create nature
Just like an architect must be on the outside of a house to build a house
How does Spinoza solve this problem?
He said nature has two sides
One side is called natura natarans
It is the vitality that enables all things to grow.
The other side is called natura naturata
That is, everything we see
For example, how did the human body grow?
It is the spontaneous growth of each cell that makes your body grow.
If cells could think
He must also think that there is some external creator who created it
But actually
The power to create a cell is within the cell itself, not outside it
same
The power that created the universe is also within the universe, not outside it.
In terms of Einstein's physics
"Producing nature" is like energy
"Produced nature" is like energy converted into mass
Therefore, the entire universe is a conservation system of mass-energy exchange.
And this system was called God by Spinoza
That's why Einstein said
He believed in Spinoza's God
Since humans are also part of this natural world
That means everyone is in God
Everyone actually enjoys a little bit of divinity
But we didn't realize it
I thought God was outside the universe
Why is this happening?
spinoza said
This is a primitive religious mentality of mankind at work.
Man discovered that everything in nature can be used for his own use
Animals and plants can be used as food by humans
Sunlight allows humans to see
Everything has value
This gives humans a feeling
oh! Someone must have designed these things for me and prepared them for me to use.
Just like parents prepare a nursery for their children to play in
same
There must be a creator behind nature, who created all things for human beings to enjoy
If God gave me all things, He must be a loving Father
So what religion calls God is actually an anthropomorphic projection.
This makes people mistakenly think that God is outside of nature
Like a father watching a child outside the nursery
Now Spinoza proved that God and nature are one and the same entity
This leads to several important conclusions
Since God is nature
Everything in the world must obey the laws of nature
Then there wouldn't be a god outside of nature interfering
So there was a big earthquake
Not because God punishes humans
It's because the plates are moving
Nature must be explained by nature
Rather than using the supernatural to explain nature
This gave science in the 17th century a voice
Causal mechanisms can be used to explain the world
Escape from the control of theology and church
Again, because everything obeys the laws of nature
So "natural" also means "inevitable"
There is some inevitable causal relationship behind everything
There is no chance in the world
If you think things are just accidental
That's just because you haven't discovered the reason yet
same
Human free will is also determined
when you want to do something
There must be some reason behind it
But Spinoza is not talking about determinism.
but causal determinism
He is not saying that people have no freedom
Because everything has been decided
It’s about making this decision today
There must be a reason
You need to understand why you think and feel the way you do
To understand the inevitability behind nature
To understand this inevitability is the highest level of knowledge
Because nature is God
So when understanding nature
People will feel a sense of happiness
Just like the feeling a scientist feels when he discovers the laws of physics
Spinoza’s view of God
Difficult for Westerners in the 17th century to understand
leading many to accuse him of being an atheist
but at the same time
China in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties
Many Catholic missionaries were surprised to find that after arriving in China
Chinese people don’t believe in the Western kind of God at all
Everybody is an atheist
The Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming Dynasties at that time believed that
Heavenly principles exist eternally in nature
Unlike Christianity, which believes in a God independent of nature,
This made Nicolas Malebranche, a Catholic philosopher at the time, think
The Chinese are all Spinozists
So you might think that Spinoza’s philosophy sounds a lot like Song and Ming Neo-Confucianism
Because there is indeed a forgotten history of exchanges between Chinese and Western philosophy.
If nature is God
And nature is just the pure law of cause and effect
Then natural events have no purpose or good or evil
Not like what the Bible says
God created the world for a purpose
Typhoons and earthquakes destroy human society
Cheetah eats antelope
Not because nature is evil
but because observers think it's evil
Nature itself does not contain value judgments of good and evil
But this value-neutral view of the universe creates a problem
If good and evil are just human subjective evaluations
Is there an objective standard that tells us how people should live?
Spinoza thinks there are
First we must understand human nature
Only then can we know what kind of life is most consistent with human nature
Spinoza’s view of human nature is different from Descartes’
Descartes believed that human beings are composed of reason (I think) and body
But Spinoza believed that human beings are made of something more fundamental:
called conatus
Some people translate it as desire
Conatus can be understood as a lump of desire energy
we can think about it
Why do people expend energy to get up and take action?
Why don't you just sit at home all day?
Spinoza believed that conatus (desire) drives people to action
This movement of energy has two levels
The first level is self-preservation
All life longs to maintain its original state
You won't see any life that wants to destroy itself
When you feel threatened by a power greater than yourself
There will be an inner urge to protect yourself
That power is desire
In addition to continuing one's own existence
There is a second level of desire
is the desire to enhance one's own strength
To increase your strength, you must take active actions to satisfy your desires
So when people act
You ask him why he did this
He will give you many reasons
But there is an unknown motive behind it
is the desire for growth in strength
For example, in "Breaking Bad"
The reason why the male protagonist Lao Bai started making drugs
To leave a fortune to the family
That is, the first level of desire, the pursuit of self-preservation
But when he started building his own drug empire
Discover that expanding your power leads to greater satisfaction
It has also been elevated to the second level of desire.
In the end, in order to pursue more power, Lao Bai
Instead, he let the drug empire destroy his family.
Here we see the contradiction of human nature
Human desire originally only pursues self-preservation
But when the opportunity arises to expand the power
People can be consumed by the desire for power
In the end, it becomes difficult to protect yourself
So it’s important to understand why people engage in certain self-destructive behaviors.
Rely on the psychology of desire, not ethics
Later, many philosophers would use this theory of desire
to explain why people would desire to be enslaved
For example, American philosopher Jason Read said
Why do people choose to do more part-time work even though they know their jobs are low-paying?
Because low-paying jobs can only satisfy the first level of desire
I can only let you live
But part-time job
Ostensibly to make more money
Behind the scenes is actually satisfying the second level of desire.
Let workers transform their sense of powerlessness into an increased sense of strength
Look how awesome I am! Can slash several jobs!
So holding multiple jobs is no longer a matter of basic salary.
It reflects how capable I am
This explains why workers themselves desire to be enslaved
Next Spinoza further deduces
Whenever our strength increases or decreases
Our bodies actually remember
And it will leave traces in the soul
This trace is called affect by Spinoza
Affect is similar to emotion and passion
when we talk about emotions
Usually refers to someone's subjective feelings
But Qingdong emphasizes the relationship between the forces and forces between two bodies.
When your body is touched by the power of another body
You may feel an increase or decrease in your desire
This kind of relationship is emotional
Like love, hate, affection, hatred in human groups
In fact, it all involves the relationship between force and force.
You like someone because they make you feel empowered
So everyone likes pistachios that exude positive energy
You hate someone not because they are bad
It's because this person makes you feel weak
For example, everyone doesn’t like sick people
So when we judge whether something is good or bad
In fact, it is the emotional memories that are touched in the body that affect us.
Like everyone hates mosquitoes
Because mosquitoes suck human blood
weaken one's strength
Or when you fall in love with someone
You think this person is very good
Maybe it’s because that person triggered your memory of your ex
Your body still retains this memory trace
It's just that you didn't realize it
This theory of emotions makes Spinoza’s theory of human nature very different from previous philosophies.
Philosophers in the past assumed that humans are rational beings
Spinoza said no
Human beings are existences dominated by desires and passions
Emotional reactions will occur as long as they are affected by external factors
It’s just that people often don’t realize it
Just like a cell if it is conscious
It only realizes the surface
without realizing it
It will see itself constantly transforming
But they don’t know that the deformation is due to internal interference when interacting with the outside world.
I thought the deformation was the result of my own conscious thinking.
When the same people create evaluations and knowledge
Will think that they are guided by rational discussion
Not aware that one's emotions are being touched
So there is a structure of misrecognition here
This is why you have rational conversations with racist and homophobic people
It's all ghosts trying to beat the wall
Because people do not think rationally
Decided to be a discriminator, homophobe
Instead, he is restricted by emotions that he is not aware of.
This view later influenced Nietzsche's view of knowledge.
Believes that there is no absolutely objective and neutral knowledge and judgment
Because of the desire for knowledge
Behind them all lies a will to power driven by emotions.
Knowledge seekers desire to use the power of knowledge to touch the emotions of others
Therefore, knowledge exchange is actually a power struggle.
Spinoza’s theory of human nature reveals
The reason why people deal with others
There is actually a deeper motivation behind it
It’s about touching other people’s emotions
Or being emotionally triggered by others
Use this to stimulate the production of power and enhance your own desire.
This explains why people behave altruistically regardless of interests.
Because even if you don’t get any benefits
Altruistic people will also feel the satisfaction of their desires
feel like a strong and powerful person
So the later philosopher Deleuze said
Spinoza's ethics is actually a kind of ethology
All interactions between animals involve the production of power
For example, lice will parasitize on the host and suck blood to enhance their own vitality.
Human nature also desires to gravitate towards people with energy
Let yourself improve and grow
The strength of power can only be determined within the relationship
People who are weaker than you, you think they are lice
But to people who are stronger than you, you are a louse
Spinoza's view of nature reveals that all things obey the law of cause and effect
Then his theory of human nature tells us
People are beings who are touched by emotions and desires
This raises a question
If a person is touched by emotions
And human actions are part of the natural causal chain.
Was that action due to free will?
Or are they just reacting to external stimuli?
Suppose you are a pork lover
When you want to eat pork
You have money to eat
You think this is freedom
But Spinoza wants you to ask
Where does this desire come from?
If you grew up in a vegetarian family
Or growing up in a Muslim society that doesn’t eat pork
You may not have the desire to eat pork
in other words
Your desires can be traced back to family desires
What you thought was freedom of movement
There's a reason behind it that you don't realize
So Spinoza asks us to ask
Is everything I pursue really coming from my own nature?
Or are there external forces influencing me that I mistake for my own desires?
This problem does not exist in Descartes' philosophy
Because Descartes believed that the mind is independent of nature
The law of cause and effect in nature cannot affect my thinking
So people still have free will
But Spinoza believed that the mind was part of nature
Then we must deal with the issue of whether people have freedom
spinoza said
The criterion for judging freedom is "The reason for my actions is myself."
Rather than being affected by the environment, emotions, or other people
A free man is the one who decides to act
rather than the person whose actions are decided
What does it mean to be determined?
For example, people know that good medicine is bitter, but they don’t take it because they are afraid of the pain.
People know that junk food is harmful to health, but they continue to eat it because it tastes good.
These are all emotions and desires guiding your actions, and you do things that are harmful to yourself.
Spinoza gives an example of fear
Plague broke out in Amsterdam in 1663
50,000 people died
At this time, religious groups came out and said
This is God's punishment
Teach people how to go to heaven after death
instead of going to hell
This fear of the afterlife
It restricts people's freedom
Because when a person is alive, if he keeps thinking about things after death
Your actions are determined by your imagination of the next life.
You live in fear your whole life, afraid of being punished after death
That's not a free man
But people who are emotionally blackmailed
Such people were called "slaves" by Spinoza
So Spinoza said: "A free man is the last person to think about death."
Later, the British writer Maugham wrote a novel called "Human Bonds"
This is the theory inspired by Spinoza
but
Is it possible for people to completely get rid of the shackles of emotions and selfish desires?
Of course Spinoza knew this was part of human nature
But the special thing about people
That is, emotions can be guided through rationality
Use one force of human nature (reason) against another force of human nature (emotion)
Suppose your boss wants to fire you
Your mood suddenly rises
But if you study economics
You will find that the unemployment rate has soared after the epidemic
Every company is laying off employees
When you understand that everything is inevitable
You won’t be led away by the emotional shackles of human nature
and be able to face it calmly
So Spinoza said:
"Don't laugh, don't cry, don't hate, just understand."
After people understand the inevitability of things,
You can use knowledge to turn sadness into joy
Thus
You are not determined by your emotions
And in turn, you can use reason to transform emotions
Like Spinoza, they are importers
The Netherlands in the 17th century
The famous tulip bubble economy occurred
After the bubble, tulip prices plummeted
Businessmen will find that financial success is only temporary
Because it is the market that decides
In fact, businessmen are not free.
It is an existence determined by external forces.
Spinoza later became indebted to the family business
He was also excommunicated from the Jewish Church
But he thought it was better this way
Because it frees him from the shackles of external restrictions
So here in Spinoza
A free life is guided by reason
to realize one's true nature
Increase your own strength
A life without freedom is restricted by external forces
do what you don't want to do
Lack of strength for self-actualization
Today's video
We introduced Spinoza's Ethics
First, prove that everything in nature is a finite existence
There is only one entity in the universe that can exist independently
It's nature itself
So everything is one
nature is god
This view inspired 20th-century philosopher Arne Naess
Put forward the perspective of deep ecology
Thinking that since everything is one
Then get to know the natural ecology
In fact, it is human beings who are understanding themselves
is a kind of self-realization
Let human beings move from limited existence to infinite existence
Then Spinoza’s Theory of Human Nature tells us
Human beings are creatures of desire, and they take action when they are moved by emotions.
The underlying motive is to enhance one's own sexual desire
But the actors themselves are not aware of it
Later Freud would apply this concept to psychology
freedom of action
There are some unconscious reasons behind it
Freud once told his friend Lothar Bickel
The idea of ​​"unconscious causality" originated from Spinoza
So Spinoza's philosophy is actually like a kind of psychotherapy
To break the inflated ego of human beings
There is some kind of cause and effect behind the freedom you think you have.
and true freedom
First of all, you must realize that you are a determined existence
After understanding the inevitability of the causal mechanism
Ability to act independently of emotions and external forces
And then gain the initiative of autonomy and self-determination
This laid an ideal of freedom for modern people
Free people can not be bound by the shackles of human nature
But the reason why people are not free
Not just because of human shackles
It is often because society and the state restrict people’s freedom
So the next video
We will introduce Spinoza’s political philosophy
See how people can break through the shackles imposed by society and the country
get true freedom
