So the far right is on the rise
everywhere in Europe.
Now, this is different from a while ago.
Just until recently,
I used to use Spain or Portugal
as examples of of countries
that didn't have the far right
as a significant force.
And the problem is not just that these
parties are getting a lot of votes.
The problem is that many of these
parties are now in government.
Look at Italy for example,
look at Hungary,
look at countries in Scandinavia.
Or when they're not in government,
they are actual contenders for it.
I don't want to think about the next
French presidential election,
or many other countries
where these parties
are significantly contending for power.
Now, why is that?
And why do other parties,
more importantly,
think that in order
to defeat the far right,
they need to copy the far right?
They need to become the far right?
Well, that is because we hear a story,
wherever we look at why this is happening,
the story we hear is that, well,
you know, it's all about immigration.
It's all about culture.
It's all about people now
not wanting globalization,
not wanting immigrants,
not wanting transnationalism,
people just wanting nationalist politics.
And all the parties are doing
is that they are responding
to this kind of popular demand,
as we call it in academia,
and therefore the far right
is on the rise.
And what I want to do is debunk this myth
and sort of disagree with this
and say, this is not
a simple story at all,
and it's not a story
only about immigration.
And it's not a story only about culture.
Actually, what it is,
is on, what we call in academia,
the demand side or the people
or the insecurities
that drive people to vote
for particular parties
are multiple and extend
way beyond culture.
They extend way beyond immigration.
But on the supply, or in other words,
the parties themselves,
they are adopting very clever
nationalist narratives
that are really able
to capture this very,
very broad coalition of voters.
So, let me start by actually
showing some of this.
This is just some data.
I'm an academic, as I said, and so I love
to talk with data and with evidence.
And this is just a very, very simple graph
that shows what the voters
of far-right parties across
different European countries look like,
or what their preferences are.
And the one key thing
that I take away from that
is that there is a non-immigration route
to far-right voting.
This shows you that one third
of far-right voters in Europe
don't report immigration concerns at all.
It also shows you that in many countries
where voters do have immigration concerns,
these are economic.
In other words, these people
have become susceptible
to narratives that say
that immigrants take away jobs,
they take away access to the labor market,
they take away access to social services.
So what I am arguing is that while
focusing on immigration is one,
perhaps, one driver
of far-right party support,
for these parties to gain the percentages
that we are seeing now,
the 20 percent and the 30 percent
and the 40 percent,
we need to look way beyond immigration
to see the other insecurities
that drive them.
And this is my visualization
of the successful far right
versus a non-successful far right.
And really what it shows you here
is that voters with cultural concerns,
I call them the culturalists,
they are definitely going
to vote for the far right.
But actually they are a very
small part of the electorate.
The voters that allow the parties
to extend well beyond their voter base
are people I call the materialists,
i.e. people who have been convinced
that the immigrants take away jobs
and access to the labor market, etc.,
they are the welfarists.
I've done a lot of research
on how social policies
actually limit the propensity.
They moderate, they compensate
insecure people,
thus limiting their propensity
to vote for the far right.
They are the distrustful.
We have so much data about
people losing trust in institutions
and political and social institutions,
in the parliament,
in the government, in the state
to deliver on its social
contract obligations.
And the anti-greens.
There is a new, big cleavage
emerging across Europe.
Those people who don't want
to pay more for the environment,
who are actually voting for the far right
because they believe that they
are being hurt by environmental policies.
These people are living particularly
in rural areas of Europe,
where they can't afford to say,
give up their car and, I don't know,
buy a new one that has no emissions
or buy more environmentally-friendly ...
Environmentally-friendly
cars or vehicles, etc.
So with these, I call
these the peripheral voters.
It is capturing these voters
that allows far-right parties
to extend well beyond
their secure voting base
and get people to vote for them.
How do they do that?
This is the key of what I'm arguing
because, you know, do you know any society
that doesn't have insecure people?
There is no society
that has no insecure people.
There is always going to be people
who are worried about their
economic situation,
they're worried about their
status in society.
But these may or may not
be captured by voters,
depending on what the parties do.
So parties have power to shape
their own electoral fortunes.
How are the far-right parties
in Europe doing this?
Well, they are putting forward
what I call civic nationalist narratives.
Or in other words,
they are sort of shifting the boundaries
of toleration on its head.
These parties are no longer
saying "I'm extreme,
and I don't want people
who are biologically different to me."
Because you know who's going
to vote for a party that is openly racist?
No, what they say is, "We exclude those
who do not espouse our liberal
democratic values.
We exclude those who don't
espouse our liberal democracies."
They are antithetical to the very essence
of the democracies
that Europe is based on.
I've got some really
interesting campaigns.
The AfD campaign,
the AfD was recently called
an extreme party in Germany.
Yet it's saying,
"No, we're not extreme."
It had this bikini campaign
a few years ago
when it was competing for elections
saying, "Well, you know what?
We just don't want these others,
who come in with their intolerant ideas
and tell us we can't
wear bikinis on the beach.
We can't, you know, drink our wine
and we can't eat our pork
because we are liberal democratic party
and we just don't want to include those
who ideologically exclude us."
Now, this is a very, very clever strategy
because this makes
parties appear more moderate.
It takes away the stigma of fascism.
It takes away the stigma of extremism.
So a voter will say, well, "It's OK,
I can vote for these people
because they are not actually extreme."
But unfortunately,
these parties are extreme.
And we see that these parties are extreme
as they increasingly enter government
and they increasingly attack
liberal democratic institutions.
So what am I saying here, just to finish?
I'm saying that if it was simply a story
about society changing,
society no longer being divided
simply by haves and have nots,
but divided on a transnational cleavage,
then we could tackle immigration
and that would be it.
But this is not what is going on.
This is not at all.
Other parties copying
the far right on immigration
are only making this problem worse.
They are only normalizing the far right
and making the far right bigger,
because the problem is not a problem
necessarily that comes from the demand.
It's a problem of supply.
But what I'm saying
is actually a good thing.
It's a positive thing
because it means, if I am right,
then this means that parties have agency.
And if the far right
has the agency to capture
broader and broader coalitions,
that's a bad thing.
But it means that we also have agency
to put on our own narratives.
Parties that oppose the far right
can also put forward successful narratives
to tackle the far right.
We have agency, and that agency
cannot be to copy the far right.
That agency has to be
to contradict the far right,
to expose it for what it is, extreme,
and to also put forward and promote
the positive aspects of immigration.
