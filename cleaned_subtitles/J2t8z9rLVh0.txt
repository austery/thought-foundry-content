All right. Hello everybody. Welcome.
>> Dude, we're literally 10 seconds late. It's not even
>> It's not even that late. Uh, thank you everybody for being here. We are here for Nvidia GTC. Jensen's going to be speaking in about five minutes. It might be a little bit later, but it should be in in five minutes at 12 p.m. Eastern. Uh, Tanner, what are you expecting? This should be a big one.
>> Should be a big one. Um, you know, GTC is all about artificial intelligence nowadays. So, um, I I'm I expect a lot of agentic stuff, uh, physical AI, self-driving, robotics, um, that sort of stuff. Maybe if we're lucky, Vera Rubin, or what the next steps are. Um, you know, that would be very, very cool to see what their next rack system would look like. Uh, we already know. I mean, they've showed it off a bunch, but um, Jensen, if he can deliver enough hype on that, that that will push the stock. A lot of the extra stuff is good to know, but if you're talking about what makes a financial difference of the business, it's, you know, what are the products that they're selling to Microsoft, Google, Amazon, etc. Um, but we'll find out. I mean, uh, we don't know 100%. A lot of people are down there though in Washington right now. Um, and I've heard nothing but good things so far.
>> Yeah, Jensen's there, Brad Gersonner's there. Um, you got the figure CEO. You got a lot of people there. I think we're I think it's going to be some interesting stuff. I mean, this is the event where they do show off their chips. So, I think it's likely, you would say, right, that we might get some Vera Rubin updates.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um, yeah, I'm I'm I'm pretty confident in it. Um, but there has been some times where they'll skip a year before showing off their next big product. I think last time was a lot of um, Blackwell Ultra talk, but you know, they've been pushing out a lot of updates on Vera Rubin, their NVL 144s. So, I hope to see that. That would be really cool.
>> Agreed. Nvidia also invested a billion in Nokia. Uh, not sure why, but they did. I imagine there's going to be some announcement of a partnership. This is what I mean. Like you're going to get a bunch of different random stuff happening today. Uh here's a little bit of a headline. Nvidia to make 1 billion equity investment in Nokia in in addition to new strategic partnership Nokia's board resolved on directed share issuance to Nvidia.
>> Yeah. Do you have any reason why they would invest? I I I don't know of a reason right now, but whenever you're making this much money, I' I've been saying this for a long time, they are definitely going to be uh having a large venture arm and and giving out a lot of money to get equity stakes in businesses that are only going to push Nvidia further.
>> Yeah. So, um, you know, they're in pole position right now and they get to make these great investments and then the products that they sell to those customers or or the products that they're going to design with these customers like Intel and like all these other partnerships that they've recently given uh, you know, money to, that only goes to further the Nvidia advantage or or their their lead position. So, um, but it all comes down to GTC. I mean, I'm I'm really excited to see.
>> So, Jensen is not live yet, but this is a clip that we had from the pre-show, and I think this clip is just pretty freaking incredible. Uh, take a look at this. He crashed a panel, delivered water, and said, "Once a bus boy, always a bus boy."
>> What?
>> Hi.
>> What's going on here?
>> Jensen Hong, everyone.
>> Oh, he brought us water.
>> Thanks.
>> He does.
>> Yes, we do. hydrated.
>> Thank you. It's very important to stay hydrated.
>> What What is this mumble jumble about quantum
>> super position
>> entanglement
>> entangling stuff? Like this is just mumble jumble.
>> Hey, good to see you.
>> You know, once a bus boy, always a bus boy.
>> This guy's worth a hundred billion delivering water. I mean, you got to love it. You got to love it. What is up with this mumbo jumbo that is quantum?
>> No, but but then he gives then he gives a little bit of a compliment
>> from Denny's to DC. From Denny's to DC.
>> Thanks for being here. Wow, this is
>> Thanks for having me. It's incredible.
>> It's been an amazing morning and this panel, I think, saving the best for last, Jensen. So, you know, maybe ask this. You you caused a kurfuffle uh last year when you you you made some comments about quantum. anything you would like to revise, you know, as we're about ready to launch our quantum panel here about how Nvidia thinks about quantum.
>> You know, I got to tell you, I'm afraid to say a word.
>> If I just said quantum, the stock price goes up. Quantum quantum quantum. I mean, he did c he caused those stocks to go 50% down in a day around March of last year or no of earlier this year of 2025 when he said, you know, quantum is decades away. I don't know about you, but I'm hearing a lot more coverage in the overall universe around quantum. So, maybe Jensen is going to embrace it. Also, the the a lot of the quantum bulls will say it's a threat
>> to the dominance of GPUs. So, there's a lot of perspectives there to understand.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, um, I don't have too many takes on quantum. We'll see what ends up happening, but, uh, I'm sure Jensen is going to keep his eye on it and, and if there is, uh, you know, if he sees large investment going that way, obviously Nvidia is going to be a big part of that as well, or at least try to position themselves there. And, and I think Bayern H by having a quantum segment and all of these things, he's definitely, you know, not avoiding it. He's not brushing it off like um I do think it's important that that GP if we're going to have a QPU QPU that uh Jensen also is involved in that. So I'm not looking to get an individual quantum name in the portfolio. I have that through you know Google or um you know you could play that through Microsoft if you want. I don't know. Um, so Jensen is not live yet. Uh, usually they start a couple minutes late, so we might have to take a minute. Uh, Tanner, it was a big day for you though so far, recovering back to 30.
>> I mean, I it was a phenomenal quarter. Like, at its core, it was a phenomenal quarter.
>> Honestly, I'm um loving the quarter. Loved everything that they had to say about the loan platform business. way more bullish on those types of metrics than I ever could have imagined. $3.4 billion dollars of loan platform origination. I mean, it was just th those are crazy numbers.
>> We have rate cuts tomorrow. I think too many people threw in the towel the second we broke under $29.
>> Yeah.
>> And and forgot to just look back at what they actually just delivered and and what's coming ahead. I mean, all the comments were, "Hey, Q3 was amazing. Best we've ever seen." and Q4 we're already like we're picking up the phone and and you know a lot of the customers that we already have are asking for more commitments for their loan platform business deals. So um they're essentially you know guidance exploded to 37 cents from 31 cents. That's after dilution. EPS is based on the total outstanding shares. So people there was a whole kurfuffle about that dilution. It's only going to accelerate their their growth rate. So, um, yeah, very happy shareholder, but like I said, this is a long-term play. SoFi stock will do SoFi stock things on earnings. I mean, it it's this is a classic at this point.
>> Yeah. And again, look, if there was actually a red flag in the quarter, I think people would have a more negative take on the stock price reaction, but people expected the stock to be I mean, I know a lot of people were excited, but this is what SoFi usually does, but you can't you can't actually point to anything negative. I mean, you really can't.
>> What are you looking forward to from GTC really quick? Oh, also, are you actually to stay on SoFi? Are you holding on to your position? I
>> mean, yeah. What else am I going to do? I feel like I can sell calls against it, right?
>> Aren't you in the money or or sorry, aren't aren't you in profit right now?
>> Yeah, but it's not. You know, I bought my average is 29. It's at 30. So, it's like
>> I thought you bought at like 26 27.
>> No, but then I averaged up. That was only like 200 shares.
>> Gotcha. So, I bought 500 more on Friday. And so, I think I don't think there's a reason to sell. I mean, we have rate cuts coming tomorrow. The quarter just crushed. So, what do I I mean, maybe I'll sell some 35 weeklies and pick up a couple cents, but I I mean, I don't think there's a reason to panic based on
>> Do you think the price uh will change tomorrow if we get rate cuts?
>> Well, yeah, but I'm also thinking the market's expecting a rate cut. So, how much of a surprise could it be? But maybe officially getting it would be the thing. I mean, I don't know if the price changes tomorrow, but I know that rate cuts are bullish. And so,
>> yeah, but last time I thought, you know, September was pretty locked in. And then we also saw quite a pump on September rate cuts for SoFi. So, um, I thought it was a little priced in, but then the market still gave it a premium.
>> Yeah.
>> So, I don't know.
>> I would not be surprised if Ray Cuds pump up so tomorrow. Would not be surprised at all. Um, Jensen, are we live? We are not live. I'm on the Nvidia mainstream. I don't see him live yet. Uh, you you asked, "What am I expecting?" I'm just expecting him to be pretty confident and continue to deliver updates on this. I this rift that he's on now is AI factories. So, I think we're going to hear a lot about that. I think the S-curve about robotics, he really wants the world to understand physical AI is coming. And then from there, hopefully some Verar Rubin stuff would be be nice to see. Jensen's not live, guys. Not yet. Oh, nope. Is wait. Is this Is this officially him? Their main screen didn't have him. Okay. All right. Let me move over to this this one.
>> See, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Salana, or XRP.
>> That's a scam.
>> That's what I was gonna say. What's the
>> Oh my gosh, they really got me on that, bro. They really got Dude, whatever channels you guys look, that was a scam. This is the official As soon as I heard Bitcoin, I was like and I saw the QR code. I was like, of course.
>> Yeah, I'm not I'm not seeing anything either.
>> Uh, Amcor, not a horrible recovery, guys. Back to 3215. This thing fell to 28. I bought the dip at 31. So, again, the quarter was really good. This was not a bad quarter. It's just when the CEO leaves, you know, the streak can get a little upset. So if we get any bullish Nvidia AI semiconductor excitement for the entire sector, you might be seeing AM Core potentially recover name lately. I I I saw your um post on X about it and and I thought it was really compelling, but I haven't looked deep enough into it. It trades at onetime sales and there's only a handful of companies that do packaging in the United States and they have a very close relationship with TSM in Arizona
>> and they just had a record Q3 revenue quarter. I mean
>> they beat on EPS by 10 cents. I mean like I
>> I think it's a very attractive play going into 26 and I'm looking for things that are not as um propped up in terms of multiples and this one doesn't have a multiple. So yeah, that's why I like it. Uh Jensen still not live. I mean, what are you expecting? Are you Are you expecting any major partnerships? Do you expect him to say anything crazy about like robotics or Cosmos or anything like that?
>> Um, no, not necessarily. I don't go in with with too high of expectations. Um, so no, I I'm here to learn, hear what he has to say. Um, you know, I don't know if we're going to get any Yeah, it's not an investor day, right? So, I'd be more interested in hearing what the earnings call has to say around China and stuff like this. This is going to be more product based. Um, so no, I don't have large expectations. I'm sure there's going to be a lot of networking talk, AI talk. If if Brett um Adcock is there, there's going to be a lot of robotics talk. There has been at GTC the last three years. So, um or last three events, but I don't have many expectations directly. No.
>> Yeah. I think robotics is going to be a big part. I agree.
>> Someone that is uh at the event is saying they are a little behind, but they're about to get going.
>> Is that Evan?
>> Um no, but Evan's also there.
>> I actually um Never mind. Yeah. Am I allowed to say that? Yeah. Evan Evan, he literally tweeted a picture that he was there.
>> No, but that uh the connection to what happened to us?
>> I don't even know what you're talking about
>> with Evan.
>> What? That he invited us to go there?
>> Yeah, that that that that we got invited.
>> I didn't know that that was something that
>> Yeah, you could. I mean, I think I think I told everybody I got invited a while. I just I didn't feel like going. So,
>> you should have went because you've been holding a video since 2018. You actually should have went.
>> I don't know why.
>> It's SoFi earnings, bro. I like
>> Oh, I forgot.
>> Day of SoFi earnings.
>> Yeah. Okay, we're starting. We're starting
>> and giving rise to Silicon Valley. HDI Lamar reimagined communication, paving the way for wireless connectivity. IBM's system 360 put a universal computer at the heart of industry. [Music] Intel's microprocessor drove the digital age forward and Craze supercomputers expanded the frontiers of science.
>> So, we think we're at the beginning of something with this technology and we're going to go just as fast as we can.

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. Computers that almost appear to think. [Music] The amount of computational resource is ultimately what's going to turbocharge this field. Artificial intelligence, the new industrial revolution. At its heart, Nvidia GPUs invented here in America. Like electricity and the internet, AI is essential infrastructure. Every company will use it. Every nation will build it.
>> Winning this competition will be a test of our capacities unlike anything since the dawn of the space age.
>> And today, AI factories are rising. Built in America for scientists, engineers, and dreamers across universities, startups, and industry.

[Music] This is America's next Apollo moment. Together, we take the next great leap to boldly go where no one has gone before. And here is where it all begins. [Music] Welcome to the stage, Nvidia founder and CEO, Jensen Wong. Washington DC. Washington DC. Welcome to GTC. [Music] It's hard not to be sentimental and proud of America. I got to tell you that. Was that video amazing? Thank you. Nvidia's creative team does an amazing job. Welcome to GTC. We have a lot to cover with you today. Um GTC is where we talk about industry, science, computing, the present, and the future. So, I've got a lot to cover with you today, but before I start, I want to thank all of our partners who helped sponsor this great event. You'll see all of them around the show. They're here to meet with you and uh uh really great. We couldn't do what we do without all of our ecosystem partners. Uh this is the Super Bowl of AI, people say. And therefore, every Super Bowl should have an amazing pregame show. What do you guys think about the pregame show? and our all allstar allstar athletes and allstar cast. Look at these guys. Somehow I turned out the buffest. What do you guys think? I don't know if I had something to do with that. Nvidia invented a new computing model for the first time in 60 years. As you saw in the video, a new computing model rarely comes about. It takes an enormous amount of time and set of conditions. We observed, we invented this computing model because we wanted to solve problems that generalpurpose computers, normal computers could not. We also observed that someday transistors will continue. The number of transistors will grow, but the performance and the power of transistors will slow down. that Moore's law will not continue beyond limited by the laws of physics and that moment has now arrived. Dinard scaling has stopped. It's called dinard scaling. Dard scaling has stopped nearly a decade ago and in fact the transistor performance and its power associated has slowed tremendously and yet the number of transistor continued. We made this observation a long time ago and for 30 years we've been advancing this form of computing we call accelerated computing. We invented the GPU. We invented the the programming model called CUDA. And we observed that if we could add a processor that takes advantage of more and more and more transistors, apply parallel computing, add that to a sequential processing CPU that we could extend the capabilities of computing well beyond well beyond. And that moment has really come. We have now seen that inflection point. Accelerated computing its moment has now arrived. However, accelerated computing is a fundamentally different programming model. You can't just take a CPU software software written by hand executing sequentially and put it onto a GPU and have it run properly. In fact, if you just did that, it actually runs slower. And so, you have to reinvent new algorithms. You have to create new libraries. You have to in fact rewrite the application which is the reason why it's taken so long. It's taken us nearly 30 years to get here. But we did it one domain at a time. This is the treasure of our company. Most people talk about the GPU. The GPU is important, but without a programming model that sits on top of it, and without dedication to that programming model, keeping it compatible over generations, we're now CUDA 13 coming up with CUDA 14, hundreds of millions of GPUs running in every single computer, perfectly compatible. If we didn't do that, then developers wouldn't target this computing platform. If we didn't create these libraries, then developers wouldn't know how to use the algorithm and use the architecture to its fullest. One application after another. I mean, these this is really the this is really the treasure of our company. CU litho computational lithography. It took us nearly seven years to get here with K litho and now TSMC uses it, Samsung uses, ASML uses it. This is an incredible library for computational lithography. the first step of making a chip. Sparse solvers for CAE applications. Co-op, a numerical optimization is broken just about every single record. The traveling salesperson problem, how to connect millions of products with millions of customers in the supply chain. Warp Python solver for CUDA for simulation. QDF a dataf frame approach basically accelerating SQL dataf frame pro dataf frame databases. Um this library is the one that started AI alto together coupnn the the library on top of it called megatron core made it possible for us to simulate and train extremely large language models. The list goes on. Uh, Monai, really, really important, the number one medical imaging AI framework in the world. Uh, by the way, we're not going to talk a lot about health care today, but be sure to see Kimberly's keynote. She's going to talk a lot about the work that we do in healthcare. And the list goes on. Uh, genomics processing, Ariel, pay attention. We're going to do something really important here today. Um, coup quantum quantum computing. This is just a representative of 350 different libraries in our company. And each one of these libraries redesigned the algorithm necessary for accelerated computing. Each one of these libraries made it possible for all of the ecosystem partners to take advantage of accelerated computing. And each one of these libraries opened new markets for us. Let's take a look at what CUDA X can do. Ready, go. [Music] Is that amazing? Every everything you saw was a simulation. There was no art, no animation. This is the beauty of mathematics. This is deep computer science, deep math. And it's just incredible how beautiful it is. Every industry was covered from healthcare and life sciences to manufacturing, robotics, autonomous vehicles, computer graphics, even video games. That first shot that you saw was the first application Nvidia ever ran. And that's where we started in 1993. And we kept believing in what we were trying to do. And it took, it's hard to imagine that you could see that first virtual fighter scene come alive and that same company believed that we would be here today. It's just really, really incredible journey. I want to thank all the NVIDIA employees for everything that you've done. It's really incredible. We have a lot of industries to cover today. I'm going to cover AI, 6G, quantum, models, enterprise computing, robotics, and factories. Let's get started. We have a lot to cover, a lot of big announcements to make, a lot of new partners that would very much surprise you. Telecommunications is the backbone, the lifeblood of our economy, our industries, our national security. And yet, ever since the beginning of wireless where we defined the technology, we defined the global standards, we exported American technology all around the world so that the world can build on top of American technology and standards. It has been a long time since that's happened. wireless technology around the world largely today deployed on foreign technologies. Our fundamental communication fabric built on foreign technologies. That has to stop and we have an opportunity to do that especially during this fundamental platform shift. As you know computer technology is at the foundation of literally every single industry. It is the single most important instrument of science. It's the single most important instrument of industry. And I just said we're going through a platform shift. That platform shift should be the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to get back into the game for us to start innovating with American technology. Today, today we're announcing that we're going to do that. We have a big partnership with Nokia. Nokia is the second largest telecommunications maker in the world. It's a $3 trillion industry. Infrastructure is hundreds of billions of dollars. There are millions of base stations around the world. If we could partner, we could build on top of this incredible new technology fundamentally based on accelerated computing and AI. and for United States, for America to be at the center of the next revolution in 6G. So today we're announcing that Nvidia has a new product line. It's called the Nvidia Arc. The aerial radio network computer, aerial RAM computer, Arc. Arc is built from three fundamental new technologies. the gray CPU, the Blackwell GPU, and our ConnectX Melanox Connect X networking designed for this application. And all of that makes it possible for us to run this library, this CUDA X library that I mentioned earlier called Aerial. Aerial is essentially a wireless communication system running on top of CUDA X. We're going to we're going to create for the first time a softwaredefined programmable computer that's able to communicate wirelessly and do AI processing at the same time. This is completely revolutionary. We call it Nvidia Arc. And Nokia is going to work with us to integrate our technology, rewrite their stack. This is a company with 7,000 fundamental essential 5G patents. Hard to imagine any greater leader in telecommunications. So, we're going to partner with Nokia. They're going to make Nvidia Arc their future base station. Nvidia Arc is also compatible with Airscale, the current Nokia base stations. So what that means is we're going to take this new technology and we'll be able to upgrade millions of base stations around the world with 6G and AI. Now 6G and AI is really quite fundamental in the sense that for the first time we'll be able to use AI technology AI for RAN to make radio communications more spectral efficient doing using artificial intelligence reinforcement learning adjusting the beam forming in real time in context depending on the surroundings and the traffic and the mobility the weather all of that could be taken into account so that we could improve spectral efficiency. Spectral efficiency consumes about one and a half to 2% of the world's power. So improving spectral efficiency not only improves the amount of data we can put through wireless networks without increasing the amount of energy necessary. The other thing that we could do AI for RAN is AI on RAM. This is a brand new opportunity. Remember the internet enabled communications but amazingly smart companies AWS built a cloud computing system on top of the internet. We are now going to do the same thing on top of the wireless telecommunications network. This new cloud will be an edge industrial robotics cloud. This is where AI on RAN the first is AI for RAN to improve radio radio spectrum efficiency. The second is AI on RAN essentially cloud computing for wireless telecommunications. Cloud computing will be able to go right out to the edge where data centers are not are not because we have base stations all over the world. This announcement is really exciting. Justin Hodar the CEO I think he's somewhere in the room. Thank you for your partnership. Thank you for helping United States bring telecommunication technology back to America. This is really a fantastic, fantastic partnership. Thank you very much. That's the best way to celebrate Nokia. Let's talk about quantum computing. 1981 particle physicist quantum physicist Richard Feman imagined a new type of computer that can simulate nature directly. To simulate nature directly because nature is quantum. He called it a quantum computer. 40 years later the industry has made a fundamental breakthrough. 40 years later, just last year, a fundamental breakthrough. It is now possible to make one logical cubit. One logical cubit. One logical cubit that's coherent, stable, and error corrected in past. Now that one logical cubit consists of could be sometimes tens, sometimes hundreds of physical cubits all working together. As you know, cubits, these particles are incredibly fragile. They could be unstable very easily. Any observation, any sampling of it, any environmental condition causes it to become decoherent. And so, it takes an extraordinarily well-controlled environments. And now also a lot of different physical cubits for them to work together and for us to do error correction on these what are called auxiliary or syndrome cubits for us to error correct them and infer what that logical cubit state is. There are all kinds of different types of quantum computers. superconducting, photonic, trapped ion, stable atom, all kinds of different ways to create a quantum computer. Well, we now realize that it's essential for us to connect a quantum computer directly to a GPU supercomputer so that we could do the error correction, so that we could do the artificial intelligence calibration and control of the quantum computer and so that we could do simulations collectively working together. the right algorithms running on the GPUs, the right algorithms running on the QPUs and the two processors, the two computers working side by side. This is the future of quantum computing. Let's take a look. supercomputing platform. Wow, this is a really long stage. You know, CEOs, we don't just sit at our desk typing. It's this is a physically job physical job. So So today we're announcing the MV MVQ link MVQL link and it's made possible by two things. Of course this interconnect that does quantum computer control and calibration quantum error correction as well as connects two computers the QPU and our GPU supercomputers to do hybrid simulations. It is also completely scalable. It doesn't just do the error correction for today's number of few cubits. It does error correction for tomorrow where we're going to essentially scale up these quantum computers from the hundreds of cubits we have today to tens of thousands of cubits, hundreds of thousands of cubits in the future. So we now have an architecture that can do control, co- simulation, quantum error correction and scale into that future. The industry support has been incredible between the invention of CUDA Q. Remember CUDA was designed for GPU CPU accelerated computing. Basically using both processors to do use the right tool to do the right job. Now CUDAQ has been extended beyond CUDA so that we could support QPU and have the two processors QPU and the GPU work and have computation move back and forth within just a few microsconds. The essential latency to be able to cooperate with the quantum computer. So now CUDAQ is such an incredible breakthrough adopted by so many different developers. We are announcing today 17 different quantum computer industry companies supporting the MVQ link and and I'm so excited about this eight different DOE labs Berkeley Brook Haven Fermy Labs in Chicago Lincoln Laboratory Los Alamos Oakidge Pacific Northwest San Die lab just about every single DOE lab has engaged us working with our ecosystem of quantum computer companies and these quantum controllers so that we could integrate quantum computing in into the future of science. Well, I have one more additional announcement to make. Today, we're announcing that the Department of Energy is partnering with Nvidia to build seven new AI supercomputers to advance our nation science.
>> Wow,
>> that's a big one.
>> That's going to move the stock. I have to have a shout out for Secretary Chris Wright. He has brought so much energy to the DOE. A surge of energy, a surge of passion to make sure that America leads science. Again, as I mentioned, computing is the fundamental instrument of science. And we are going through several platform shifts. On the one hand, we're going to accelerated computing. That's why every future supercomputer will be GPUbased supercomputer. We're going to AI. So that AI and principled solvers, principled simulation, principled physics simulation is not going to go away, but it could be augmented, enhanced, scaled, use surrogate models, AI models working together. We also know that principal solvers, classical computing could be enhanced to understand the state of nature using quantum computing. We also know that in the future we have so much signal, so much data we have to sample from the world. Remote sensing is more important than ever. And these laboratories are impossible to experiment at the scale and speed we need to unless they're robotic factories, robotic laboratories. So all of these different technologies are coming into science at exactly the same time. Secretary Wright understands this and he wants the DOE to take this opportunity to supercharge themselves and make sure the United States stay at the forefront of science. I want to thank all of you for that. Thank you. Let's talk about AI. What is AI? Most people would say that AI is a chatbot and it it's rightfully so. There's no question that Chad GPT is at the forefront of what people would consider AI. However, just as you see right now, these scientific supercomputers are not going to run chatbots. They're going to do basic science. Science, AI, the world of AI is much much more than a chatbot. Of course, the chatbot is extremely important and AGI is fundamentally critical. deep computer science, incredible computing, great breakthroughs are still essential for AGI. But beyond that, AI is a lot more. AI is in fact, I'm going to describe AI in a couple different ways. This first way, the first way you think about AI is that it has completely reinvented the computing stack. The way we used to do software was hand coding. hand coding software running on CPUs. Today AI is machine learning training data inensive programming if you will trained and learned by AI that runs on a GPU. In order to make that happen, the entire computing stack has changed. Notice you don't see Windows up here. You don't see CPU up here. You see a whole different a whole fundamentally different stack. Everything from the need for energy. And this is another area where our administration, President Trump gets deserves enormous credit. His pro- energy initiative, his recognition that this industry needs energy to grow. It needs energy to advance and we need energy to win. His recognition of that and putting the weight of the nation behind pro- energy growth completely changed the game. If this didn't happen, we could have been in a bad situation and I want to thank President Trump for that. On top of energy are these GPUs and these GPUs are connected into built into infrastructure that I'll show you later. On top of this infrastructure which in consists of giant data centers like easily many times the size size of this room enormous amount of energy which then transfer transforms the energy through this new machine called GPU supercomputers to generate numbers. These numbers are called tokens. the language, if you will, the computational unit, the vocabulary of artificial intelligence. You can tokenize almost anything. You can tokenize, of course, the English word. You can tokenize images. That's the reason why you're able to recognize images or generate images, tokenize video, tokenize 3D structures. You could tokenize chemicals and proteins and genes. You could tokenize cells, tokenize almost anything with structure, anything with information content. Once you could tokenize it, AI can learn that language and the meaning of it. Once it learns the meaning of that language, it can translate. It can respond just like you respond just like you interact with chat GPT. And it could generate just as chat GPT can generate. So all of the fundamental things that you see Chad GPD do, all you have to do is imagine what if it was a protein, what if it was a chemical, what if it was a 3D structure like a factory, what if it was a robot and the token was understanding behavior and tokenizing motion and action. All of those concepts are basically the same, which is the reason why AI is making such extraordinary progress. And on top of these models are applications transformers. Transformers is not a universal model. It's incredibly effective model. But there's no one universal model. It's just that AI has universal impact. There are so many different types of models. There's in the last several years we enjoyed the invention and went through the innovation breakthroughs of multimodality. There's so many different types of models. There's CNN models, competition neuronet network models, their state space models, their graph neuronet network models, multimodal models, of course, all the different tokenizations and token methods that I just described. You could have models that are spatial in its understanding, optimized for spatial awareness. You could have models that are optimized for long sequence, recognizing subtle information over a long period of time. There's so many different types of models. On top of these models architectures, on top of these model architectures are applications, the software of the past. And this is a a profound understanding, a profound observation of artificial intelligence that the software industry of the past was about creating tools. Excel is a tool. Word is a tool. A web browser is a tool. The reason why I know these are tools is because you use them. The tools industry, just as screwdrivers and hammers, the tools industry is only so large. In the case of IT tools, they could be database tools. These IT tools is about a trillion dollars or so. But AI is not a tool. AI is work. That is the profound difference. AI is in fact workers that can actually use tools. One of the things I'm really excited about is the work that Irvin's doing at Perplexity. Perplexity using web browsers to book vacations or do shopping. Basically an AI using tools. Cursor is an AI, a nigantic AI system that we use at NVIDIA. Every single software engineer at Nvidia uses cursor. That's improved our productivity tremendously. It's basically a partner for every one of our software engineers to generate code and it uses a tool and the tool it uses is called VS code. So cursor is an AI agentic AI system that uses VS code. Well, all of these different industries whether it's chatbots or digital biology where we have AI assistant researchers or what is a robo taxi inside a robo taxi? Of course, it's invisible, but obviously there's a there's a AI chauffeur. That chauffeur is doing work. And the tool that it uses to do that work is the car. And so everything that we've made up until now, the whole world, everything that we've made up until now are tools. Tools for us to use. For the very first time, technology is now able to do work and help us be more productive. The list of opportunities go on and on, which is the reason why AI addresses the segment of the economy that it has never addressed. It is a few trillion dollars that sits underneath the tools of a hundred trillion dollar global economy. Now, for the first time, AI is going to engage that hundred trillion dollar economy and make it more productive, make it grow faster, make it larger. We have a severe shortage of labor. Having AI that augments labor is going to help us grow. Now what's interesting about this from a technology industry perspective also is that in addition to the fact that AI is new technology that addresses new segments of the economy AI in itself is also a new industry this token as I was explaining earlier these numbers after you tokenize all these different modalities of information there's a factory that needs to produce these numbers unlike the computer industry indry and the chip industry of the past. Notice if you look at the chip industry of the past, the chip industry represents about 5 to 10% maybe less 5% or so of a multi- trillion dollar few trillion dollar IT industry. And the reason for that is because it doesn't take that much computation to use Excel. It doesn't take that much computation to use browsers. It doesn't take that much computation to use word. We do the computation. But in this new world, there needs to be a computer that understands context all the time. It can't precomputee that because every time you use the computer for AI, every time you ask the AI to do something, the context is different. So, it has to process all of that information. Environmental, for example, in the case of a self-driving car, it has to process the context of the car. context processing. What is the instruction you're asking the AI to do? Then it's got to go and break down the problem step by step, reason about it, and come up with a plan and execute it. Every single one of that step requires enormous number of tokens to be generated which is the reason why we need a new type of system and I call it an AI factory. It's an AI factory for short. It's unlike a data center of the past. is an AI factory because this factory produces one thing unlike the data centers of the past that does everything. Stores files for all of us, runs all kinds of different applications. You could use that data center like you can use your computer for all kinds of applications. You could use it to play game one day. You could use it to browse the web. You could use it, you know, to do your accounting. And so that is a computer of the past, a universal generalpurpose computer. The computer I'm talking about here is a factory. It runs basically one thing. It runs AI and its purpose, its purpose is designed to produce tokens that are as valuable as possible, meaning they have to be smart. And you want to produce these tokens at incredible rates because when you ask an AI for something, you would like it to respond. And notice during peak hours, these AIs are now responding slower and slower because it's got a lot of work to do for a lot of people. And so you wanted to produce valuable tokens at incredible rates and you wanted to produce it cost effectively. Every single word that I used are consistent with an AI factory with a car factory or any factory. It is absolutely a factory. And these factories these factories never existed before. And inside these factories are mountains and mountains of chips. Which brings to today what happened in the last couple years. And in fact, what happened this last year? Something fairly profound happened this year. Actually, if you look in the beginning of the year, everybody has some attitude about AI. That attitude is generally this is going to be big. It's going to be the future. And somehow a few months ago, it kicked into turbocharge. And the reason for that is several things. The first is that we in the last couple years have figured out how to make AI much much smarter rather than just pre-training. Pre-training basically says let's take all of the all of the information that humans have ever created. Let's give it to the AI to learn from. It's essentially memorization and generalization. It's no it's not unlike going to school back when we were kids. the first stage of learning. Pre-training was never meant just as preschool was never meant to be the end of education. Pre-training, preschool was simply teaching you the basic skills of intelligence so that you can understand how to learn everything else. Without vocabulary, without understanding of language and how to communicate, how to think, it's impossible to learn everything else. The next is post-training. Post-training after pre-training is teaching you skills. Skills to solve problem. Break down problems. Reason about it. How to solve math problems. How to code. How to think about these problems step by step. Use first principal reasoning. And then after that is where computation really kicks in. As you know for many of us, you know, we went to school and that's in my case decades ago. But ever since I've learned more, thought about more. And the reason for that is because we're constantly grounding oursel in new knowledge. We're constantly doing research, and we're constantly thinking. Thinking is really what intelligence is all about. And so now we have three fundamental technology skills. We have these three technology. Pre-training, which still requires enormous enormous amount of computation. We now have post training which uses even more computation and now thinking puts incredible amounts of computation load on the infrastructure because it's thinking on our behalf for every single human. So the amount of computation necessary for AI to think inference is really quite extraordinary. Now I used to hear people say that inference is easy. Nvidia should do training. Nvidia is going to do you know they are really good at this so they're going to do training that inference was easy how could thinking be easy regurgitating memorized content is easy regurgitating the multiplication table is easy thinking is hard which is the reason why these three scales these three new scaling laws which is all of it in in full steam has put so much pressure on the amount of computation Now another thing has happened from these three scaling laws. We get smarter models and these smarter models need more compute. But when you get smarter models, you get more intelligence. People use it as if anything happens. I want to be the first one out. Jazz. I'm sure it's fine. Probably just lunch. My stomach. Was that me? And so, so where was I? The smarter your models are, the smarter your models are, the more people use it. It's now more grounded. It's able to reason. It's able to solve problems it never learn how to solve before because it could do research. Go learn about it. come back, break it down, reason about how to solve your how to answer your question, how to solve your problem and go off and solve it. The amount of thinking is making the models more intelligent. The more intelligent it is, the more people use it. The more intelligent it is, the more computation is necessary. But here's what happened. This last year, the AI industry turned a corner. Meaning that the AI models are now smart enough. They're making they're worthy. They're worthy to pay for. Nvidia pays for every license of Cursor. And we gladly do it. We gladly do it because cursor is helping a several hundred,000 employee software engineer or AI researcher be many, many times more productive. So, of course, we'd be more than happy to do that. These AI models have become good enough that they are worthy to be paid for. Cursor, 11 Labs, Syntheasia, A Bridge, Open Evidence, the list goes on. Of course, open AI, of course, Claude. These models are now so good that people are paying for it. And because people are paying for it and using more of it, and every time they use more of it, you need more compute. We now have two exponentials. These two exponentials, one is the exponential compute requirement of the three scaling law. And the second exponential, the more pe the smarter it is, the more people use it, the more people use it, the more computing it needs. Two exponentials now putting pressure on the world's computational resource at exactly the time when I told you earlier that Moore's law has largely ended. And so the question is what do we do? If we have these two exponential demands growing and if we don't if we don't find a way to drive the cost down then this positive feedback system this circular feedback system essentially called the virtual cycle essential for almost any industry essential for any platform industry. It was essential for Nvidia. We have now reached the virtual cycle of CUDA. The more applications, the more the more applications people create, the more valuable CUDA is. The more valuable CUDA is, the more CUDA computers are purchased. The more CUDA computers are purchased, more developers want to create applications for it. That virtual cycle for Nvidia has now been achieved after 30 years. We have achieved that also. 15 years later, we've achieved that for AI. AI has now reached the virtual cycle. And so the more you use it because the AI is smart and we pay for it. The more profit is generated, the more profit generated, the more computes put to on the on the grid, the more compute is put into AI factories, the more comput the AI becomes smarter, the smarter, more more people use it, more applications use it, the more problems we can solve. This virtual cycle is now spinning. What we need to do is drive the cost down tremendously so that one the user experience is better when you prompt the AI it responds to you much faster and two so that we keep this virtual cycle going by driving its cost down so that it could get smarter so that more people use it so that so on so forth that virtual cycle is now spinning but how do we do that when Moore's law has really reached this limit well the answer is called codeesign design. You can't just design chips and hope that things on on top of it is going to go faster. The best you could do in designing chips is add I don't know 50% more transistors every couple of years. And if you added more transistors just you we can add more transistors and TSMC's got a lot of transistor. Incredible company. We just keep adding more transistors. However, that's all in percentages not exponentials. We need to compound exponentials to keep this virtual cycle going. We call it extreme code design. Nvidia is the only company in the world today that literally starts from a blank sheet of paper and can think about new fundamental architecture, computer architecture, new chips, new systems, new software, new model architecture, and new applications all at the same time. So many of the people in this room are here because you're different parts of that layer that different parts of that stack and working with Nvidia. We fundamentally rearchitect everything from the ground up and then because AI is such a large problem, we scale it up. We created a whole computer, a computer for the first time that has scaled up into an entire rack. That's one computer, one GPU. And then we scale it out by inventing a new AI Ethernet technology we call Spectrum X Ethernet. Everybody will say Ethernet is Ethernet. Ethernet is hardly Ethernet. Ethernet. Spectrum X Ethernet is designed for AI performance. And it's the reason why it's so successful. And even that's not big enough. We'll fill this entire room of AI supercomputers and GPUs. That's still not big enough because the number of applications and the number of users for AI is continuing to grow exponentially. And we connect multiple of these data centers together and we call that scale across spectrum XGS gigascale X spectrum X gigascale XGS. By doing so, we do code design at such a such an enormous level, such an extreme level that the performance benefits are shocking. Not 50% better each generation, not 25% better each generation, but much much more. This is the most extreme code-designed computer we've ever made and quite frankly made in modern times. Since the IBM system 360, I don't think a computer has been ground up, reinvented like this ever. This system was incredibly hard to create. I'll show you the benefits in just a second. But essentially what we've done, essentially what we've done, we've created otherwise Hey Janine, you can come out. It's you have to have to meet me like halfway. All right. So, this is kind of like Captain America shield. So, MVLink 72, MVLink72, if we were to create one giant chip, one giant GPU, this is what it would look like. This is the level of wafer scale processing we would have to do. It's incredible. All of this, all of these chips are now put into one giant rack. Did I do that or did somebody else do that? Into that one giant rack. You know, sometimes I don't feel like I'm up here by myself. Just this one giant rack makes all of these chips work together as one. It's actually completely incredible. And I'll show you the benefits of that. The way it looks is this. So, thanks Janine. I I like this. All right, ladies and gentlemen. Janine Paul. I got it. In the future next, I'm just going to go like Thor. It's like when you're at home and and you can't reach the remote and you just go like this and somebody brings it to you. That's Yeah. Same idea. It never happens to me. I'm just dreaming about it. I'm just saying. Okay. So, so anyhow, anyhow, um we basically this is what we created in the past. This is MVLink MVLink 8. Now, these models are so gigantic. The way we solve it is we turn this model, this gigantic model, into a whole bunch of experts. It's a little bit like a team. And so, these experts are good at certain types of problems. And we collect a whole bunch of experts together. And so, this giant multi- trillion dollar AI model has all these different experts and we put all these different experts on a GPU. Now, this is NVLink 72. We could put all of the chips into one giant fabric and every single expert can talk to each other. So the master the the primary expert could talk to all of the tri work and all of the necessary context and prompts and bunch of data that we have to bunch of tokens that we have to send to all of the experts. The experts would whichever one of the experts are selected to solve the answer would then go off and try to respond and then it would go off and do that layer after layer after layer. Sometimes eight, sometimes 16 and sometimes these experts, sometimes 64, sometimes 256. But the point is there are more and more and more experts. Well, here MVLink 72, we have 72 GPUs. And because of that, we could put four experts in one GPU. The most important thing you need to do for each GPU is to generate tokens, which is the amount of bandwidth that you have in HBM memory. We have one H one GPU generating thinking for four experts versus here because each one of the computers can only put eight GPUs. We have to put 32 experts into one GPU. So this one GPU has to think for 32 experts versus this system each GPU only has to think for four. And because of that the speed difference is incredible. And this just came out. This is the benchmark done by semi analysis. They do a really really thorough job and they benchmarked all of the GPUs that are benchmarkable and it turns out it's not that many. If you look at the list of looks list of GPUs you could actually benchmark is like 90% Nvidia. Okay. And but so we're comparing ourselves to ourselves but the second best GPU in the world is the H200 and runs all the workload. Grace Blackwell per GPU is 10 times the performance. Now, how do you get 10 times the performance when it's only twice the number of transistors? Well, the answer is extreme code design. And by understanding the nature of the future of AI models and we're thinking across that entire stack, we can create architectures for the future. This is a big deal. It says we can now respond a lot faster. But this is even bigger deal. This next one, look at this. This says that the lowest cost tokens in the world are generated by Grace Blackwell and Vlink 72. The most expensive computer. On the one hand, GB200 is the most expensive computer. On the other hand, its token generation capability is so great that it produces it at the lowest cost because the tokens per second divided by the t by the total cost of ownership of Grace Blackwell is so good. It is the lowest cost way to generate tokens. By doing so, delivering incredible performance, 10 times the performance, incre delivering 10 times lower cost, that virtual cycle can continue. Which then brings me to this one. I just saw this literally yesterday. This is uh the CSP capex. People are asking me about capex these days and this is a good way to look at it. In fact, the capex of the top six CSPs and this one, this one is Amazon, Core Weave, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. Okay, these CSPs together are going to invest this much in capex. And I would I would tell you the timing couldn't be better. And the reason for that is now we have the Grace Blackwell MVLink72 in all volume production, supply chain, everywhere in the world is manufacturing it. So we can now deliver to all of them this new architecture so that the capex invests in instruments computers that deliver the best TCO. Now underneath this there are two things that are going on. So when you look at this it's actually fairly extraordinary and it's fairly extraordinary anyhow but what's happening under underneath is this there are two platform shifts happening at the same time. One platform shift is going from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. Remember accelerated computing as I mentioned to you before it does data processing. It does image processing, computer graphics, it does com comput computation of all kinds. It runs SQL, runs Spark, it runs, you know, you you ask it, you tell us what you need to have run, and I'm fairly certain we have an amazing library for you. You could be, you know, a data center trying to make masks to manufacture semiconductors. we have a great library for you. And so underneath irrespective of AI, the world is moving from general purpose computing to accelerated computing irrespective of AI. And in fact, many of the CSPs already have services that have been here long ago before AI. Remember, they were invented in the era of machine learning. classical machine learning algorithms like XG boost, algorithms like um uh data frames that are used for recommener systems, collaborative filtering, content filtering, all of those technologies were created in the old days of general purpose computing. Even those algorithms, even those architectures are now better with accelerated computing. And so even without AI, the world's CSPs are going to invest into acceleration. Nvidia's GPU is the only GPU that can do all of that plus AI. And ASIC might be able to do AI, but it can't do any of the others. Nvidia could do all of that, which explains why it is so safe to just lean into Nvidia's architecture. We have now reached our virtual cycle, our inflection point. And this is quite extraordinary. I have many partners in the room and all of you are part of our supply chain and I know how hard you guys are working. I want to thank all of you how hard you are working and thank you very much. Now I'm going to show you why this is what's going on in our company's business. We're seeing extraordinary growth for Grace Blackwell for all the reasons that I just mentioned. It's driven by two exponentials. We now have visibility. I think we're probably the first technology company in history to have visibility into half a trillion dollars of cumulative blackwell and early ramps of Reubin through 2026. And as you know, 2025 is not over yet and 2026 hasn't started. This is how much business is on the books. Half a trillion dollars worth so far. Now, this is out of that. We've already shipped 6 million of the Blackwells in the first several quarters. I guess the first four quarters of production, three and a half quarters of production. We still have one more quarter to go for 2025. And then we have four quarters. So the next five quarters there's $500 million $500 billion half a trillion dollars. That's five times the growth rate of Hopper. That kind of tells you something. This is Hopper's entire life. This doesn't include China and and um and Asia. So this is just uh the West. Okay. This is just uh we're excluding China. So Hopper in its entire life 4 million GPUs. Blackwell. Each one of the Blackwells has two GPUs in it in one large package. 20 million GPUs of Blackwells in the early parts of Reuben. Incredible growth. So, I want to thank all of our supply chain partners. Everybody, I know how hard you guys are working. I made a video to celebrate your work. Let's play it. [Music] The age of AI has begun. Blackwell is its engine, an engineering marvel. In Arizona, it starts as a blank silicon wafer. Hundreds of chip processing and ultraviolet lithography steps build up each of the 200 billion transistors layer by layer on a 12in wafer. In Indiana, HBM stacks will be assembled in parallel. HBM memory dieseS with 1,024 IO's are fabricated using advanced EUV technology through silicon via is used in the back end to connect 12 stacks of HBM memory and base dye to produce HBM. Meanwhile, the wafer is scribed into individual Blackwell dye, tested and sorted, separating the good dyes to move forward. The chip on wafer on substrate process attaches 32 Blackwell dies and 128 HPM stacks on a custom silicon interposer wafer.
>> Nvidia 196 alltime highs, baby on Nvidia. directly into it, connecting Blackwell GPUs and HBM stacks into each system and package unit, locking everything into place. Then the assembly is baked, molded, and cured, creating the GB300 Blackwell Ultra Super Chip. In Texas, robots will work around the clock to pick and place over 10,000 components onto the Grace Blackwell PCB. In California, Connect X8 Supernix for scaleout communications and Bluefield 3 DPUs for offloading and accelerating networking, storage, and security are carefully assembled into GB300 compute trays. NVLink is the breakthrough high-speed link that Nvidia invented to connect multiple GPUs and scale up into a massive virtual GPU. The MVLink switch tray is constructed with MVLink switch chips providing 14.4 terabytes per second of all to all bandwidth. MVLink spines form a custom blindmated back plane with 5,000 copper cables connecting all 72 black wells or 144 GPU dice into one giant GPU delivering 130 terabytes per second of all to-all bandwidth nearly the global internet's peak traffic. Skilled technicians assemble each of these parts into a rack scale AI supercomput. In total, 1.2 million components, 2 m of copper cable, 130 trillion transistors, weighing nearly 2 tons. From silicon in Arizona and Indiana to systems in Texas, Blackwell and future Nvidia AI factory generations will be built in America, writing a new chapter in American history and industry. America's return to making and reindustrialization, reignited by the age of AI. The age of AI has begun. Made in America. Made for the world. Ble. We are manufacturing in America again. It is incredible. The first thing that President Trump asked me for is bring manufacturing back. Bring manufacturing back because it's it's necessary for national security. bring manufacturing back because we want the jobs and we want that part of the economy. And nine months later, nine months later, we are now manufacturing in full production Blackwell in Arizona. Extreme Blackwell GB 200 MV Grace Blackwell Envy 72 extreme code design gives us 10x generationally. It's utterly incredible. Now, the part that's really incredible is this. This is the first AI supercomput we made. This is in 2016 when I delivered it to a startup in San Francisco which turned out to have been OpenAI. This was the computer. And in order to do the create that computer, we designed one chip. We designed one new chip in order for us to do code design. Now, look at all of the chips we have to do. This is what it takes. You're not going to take one chip and make a computer 10 times faster. That's not going to happen. The way to make computers 10 times faster we can keep increasing the performance exponentially. We can keep driving cost down exponentially is extreme code design and working on all these different chips at the same time. We now have Ruben back home. This is Ruben. This is the Vera Rubin and and uh Ruben. Ladies and gentlemen, Ruben This is this is our third generation MVLink 72 rack scale computer. Third generation GB200 was the first one. All of our partners around the world, I know how hard you guys worked. It was insanely hard. It was insanely hard to do. Second generation, so much smoother. And this generation, look at this. Completely cableless. completely cableless. And this is this is all back in the lab now. This is the next generation Reuben. While we're shipping GB300's, uh we're preparing Reuben to be in production. You know, this time next year, maybe slightly earlier. And so, every single year, we are going to come up with the most extreme code design system so that we can keep driving up performance and keep driving down the token generation cost. Look at this. This is just an incredibly beautiful computer. Now, so this is amazing. This is 100 pedaflops. I know this doesn't mean anything. 100 pedlops, but compared to the DGX1 I delivered to OpenAI 10 years ago, 9 years ago, it's 100 times the performance right here versus 100 times of that supercomput. 100 times a 100 of those, let's see, a 100 of those would be like 25 of these racks all replaced by this one thing. One Vera Rubin. Okay. So this is this is the compute tray and this is so Vera Rubin super chip. Okay. And this is the compute tray. This Oh right here. It's incredibly easy to install. Just flip these things open, shove it in. Even I could do it. Okay. And this is the ver Vera Rubin compute tray. If you decide you wanted to add a special processor, we've added another processor. It's called a context processor because the amount of context that we give AIS are larger and larger. We wanted to read a whole bunch of PDFs before it answer a question. Wanted to read a whole bunch of archive papers, watch a whole bunch of videos. Go learn all this before you answer a question for me. All of that context processing could be added. And so you see on the bottom eight connectx9 new super nicks. You have CX you have uh CPXs eight of them. You have uh blue field 4 this new data processor two Vera CPUs and four Reuben packages or eight Reuben GPUs. All of that in this one node completely cableless 100% liquid cooled and then this new processor I won't talk too much about it today I don't have enough time but this is completely revolutionary and the reason for that is because your AIs need to have more and more memory you're interacting with it more you wanted to remember our last conversation everything that you've learned on my behalf please don't forget it when I come back next time and so all of that memory is going to create this thing called KV caching. And that KV caching retrieving it, you might have noticed every time you go into your your your AIS these days, it takes longer and longer to refresh and retrieve all of the previous conversations and and the reason for that is we need a revolutionary new processor and that's called Blue Fuel 4. Next is this the connectex switch, excuse me, the MVLink switch which is right here. Okay, this is the MVLink switch. This is what makes it possible for us to con connect all of the computers together. And this switch is now several times the bandwidth of the entire world's peak internet traffic. And so that spine is going to communicate and carry all of that data simultaneously to all of the GPUs. On top of that, on top of that, this is the this is the Spectrum X switch. And this Ethernet switch was designed so that all of the processors could talk to each other at the same time and not gum up the network. Gum up the network. That's very technical. Okay. So, um, so these are the these three combined. And then this is the quantum switch. This is for Infiniban. This is Ethernet. We don't care what language you would like to use, whatever standard you like to use. We have great scale out fabrics for you. Whether it's Infiniban or Quant or Spectrum Ethernet, this one uses silicon photonics and is completely co-acked options. Basically, the laser comes right up to the silicon and connects it to our chips. Okay. So, this is the Spectrum X Ethernet. And so, now let's talk about Thank you. Oh, this is this is what it looks like. This is a rack. This is two and a half. This is two uh 2,00 This is two tons. 1.5 million parts. And the spine, this spine right here carries the entire internet traffic in one second. Same speed moves across all of these different processors. 100% liquid cooled. All for the, you know, fastest token generation rate in the world. Okay, so that's what a rack looks like. Now that's one rack. A gigawatt data center would have you know call it let's see 16 racks would be a th00and um and then 500 of those. So whatever 500 time 16 and so call it 9,000 of these 8,000 of these would be a one gigawatt data center. Okay. And so that's a future AI factory. Now we used, as you notice, Nvidia started out by designing chips and then we started to design systems and we designed AI supercomputers. Now we're designing entire AI factories. Every single time we move out and we integrate more of the problem to solve, we come up with better solutions. We now build entire AI factories. This is going this AI factory is what we're building for Vera Rubin and we created a technology that makes it possible for all of our partners to integrate into this factory digitally. Let me show it to you. The next industrial revolution is here and with it a new kind of factory. AI infrastructure is an ecosystem scale challenge requiring hundreds of companies to collaborate. NVIDIA Omniverse DSX is a blueprint for building and operating Once designed, Nvidia partners like Bectal and Vertive deliver prefabricated modules factory-built, tested, and ready to plug in. This shrinks build time significantly, achieving faster time to revenues. When the physical AI factory comes online, the digital twin acts as an operating system. Engineers prompt AI agents from FIDRA and Emerald AI, previously trained in the digital twin to optimize power consumption and reduce strain on both the AI factory and the grid. In total, for a 1 gawatt AI factory, DSX optimizations can deliver billions of dollars in additional revenue per year across Texas, Georgia, and Nevada. NVIDIA's partners are bringing DSX to life. In Virginia, Nvidia is building an AI factory research center using DSX to test and productize Vera Rubin from infrastructure to software. With DSX, Nvidia partners around the world can build and bring up AI infrastructure faster than ever. [Music] completely completely in digital long long before Vera Rubin exists as a real computer we've been using it as a digital twin computer now long before these AI factories exist we will use it we will design it we'll plan it we'll optimize it and we'll operate it as a digital twin and so all of our partners that are working with us I'm incredibly happy for all of you supporting us and Gio is here and G ver Vernova is here. Schneider, I I think um I think uh uh Olivia is here. Olivia Blum is here. Um uh uh Seaman's incredible partners. Okay, Roland Bush, I think he's watching. Hi Roland. And so anyways, uh really really great partners working with us. In the beginning, we had CUDA and we have all these different ecosystems of software partners. Now we have Omniverse, DSX, and we're building AI factories. And again, we have these incredible ecosystem of partners working with us. Let's talk about models, open source models particularly. In the last couple years, several things have happened. One, open source models have become quite capable because of reasoning capabilities. It has become quite capable because they're multimodality and they're incredibly efficient because of distillation. So all these different capabilities have become uh has made open source models for the very first time incredibly useful for developers. They are now the lifeblood of startups. Lifeblood of startups in different industries because obviously as I mentioned before each one of the industries have its own use case, it own use cases, it own data, it owns data, its own flywheels. All of that capability, that domain expertise needs to have the ability to embed into a model. Open source makes that possible. Researchers need open-source. Developers need open-source. Companies around the world, we need open source. Open- source models is really, really important. The United States has to lead in open source as well. We have amazing proprietary models. We have amazing proprietary models. We need also amazing open source models. Our country depends on it. Our startups depend on it. And so Nvidia is dedicating ourselves to go do that. We are now the largest the largest we lead in open-source contribution. We have 23 models in leaderboards. We have all these different domains from language models the physical AI models. I'm going to talk about robotics models to biolog biology models. Each one of these models has enor enormous teams and that's one of the reasons why we built supercomputers for ourselves to enable all these models to be created. We have number one speech model, number one reasoning model, number one physical AI model. The number of downloads is really really terrific. We are dedicated to this and the reason for that is because science needs it, researchers need it, startups need it and companies need it. I'm delighted that AI startups build on Nvidia. They do so for several reasons. One, of course, our ecosystem is rich. Our tools work great. All of our tools work on all of our GPUs. Our GPUs are everywhere. It's literally in every single cloud. It's available on prem. You could build it yourself. You could you could, you know, build up a an enthusiast gaming PC with multiple GPUs in it and you could download our software stack and it it just works. We have the benefit of rich developers who are making this ecosystem richer and richer and richer. So, I'm really pleased with all of the startups that we're working with. I'm I'm thankful for that. It is also the case that many of these startups are now starting to create even more ways to enjoy our GPUs. the Cordweaves, Nscale, Nimbius, Llama, Lambda, all of these companies, Crusoe companies are building these new GPU clouds to serve the startups. And I really appreciate that this is all possible because NVIDIA is everywhere. We integrate our libraries, all of the CUDA X libraries I talked to you about, all the open-source AI models that I talked about, all of the models that I talked about, we integrated into AWS, for example. really love working with Matt. We integrated into Google Cloud, for example. Really love working with Thomas. Each one of these clouds integrate NVIDIA GPUs and our computing, our libraries as well as our models. Love working with Satia over at Microsoft Azure. Love working with uh Clay at Oracle. Each one of these clouds integrate the NVIDIA stack. As a result, wherever you go, whichever cloud you use, it works incredibly. We also integrate Nvidia libraries into the world SAS so that each one of these SAS will eventually become agentic SAS. I love Bill McDerman's vision for Service Now. There the Yeah, there you go. I think that might have been Bill. Hi, Bill. And so Service Now, what is it? 85% of the world's enterprise workloads, workflows, SAP, 80% of the world's commerce. Christian Klein and I are working together to integrate NVIDIA libraries, CUDA X and Nemo and Neotron, all of our AI systems into SAP, working with Ceine over at Synopsis, accelerating the world CAE, CAD, EDA tools so that they could be faster and could scale, helping them create AI agents. One of these days I would love to hire a AI agent ASIC designers to work with our ASIC designers essentially the cursor of synopsis if you will. We're working with uh Andy Rude. Annie Rude here I saw him earlier today. He was part of the pregame show. Cadence doing incredible work accelerating their stack creating AI agents so that we can have cadence AI as designers and system designers working with us. Today we're announcing a new one. AI will supercharge productivity. AI will transform just about every industry. But AI will also supercharge cyber security challenges, the bad AIs. And so we need an incredible defender. I can't imagine a better defender than Crowd Strike. George George is here. Uh he was Yeah, I saw him earlier. We are partnering with CrowdStrike to make cyber security speed of light to create a system that has cyber security AI agents in the cloud but also incredibly good AI agents on prem or at the edge. This way you whenever there's a threat you are moments away from detecting it. We need speed and we need a fast agentic AI super a super smart AIS. I have a second announcement. This is the single fastest enterprise enterprise company in the world. Probably the single most important enterprise stack in the world today. Palunteer ontology. Anybody from Palunteer here? I just I was just talking to Alex earlier.
>> Oh my god. Oh my goodness.
>> This is Palenter ontology.
>> Oh my goodness. We've been waiting so long for this
>> information. They take data. They take human judgment and they turn it into business insight. We work with Palanteer to accelerate everything Palanteer does so that we could do data processing data processing at a much much larger scale and more speed whether it's structured data of the past and of course we'll have structured data human recorded data unstructured data and process that data for our government for national security and for enterprises around the world process that data at speed of and to find insight from it. This is what it's going to look like in the future. Palunteer is going to integrate NVIDIA so that we could process at the speed of light and at extraordinary scale.
>> Oh my goodness.
>> NVIDIA and Palanteer.
>> I'm going to come. I'm going to come.
>> Let's relax.
>> Physical AI requires three computers. Just as it takes two computers to train a language model. One that's to train it, evaluate it, and then inference it. Okay, so that's the large GB200 that you see. In order to do it for physical AI, you need three computers. You need the computer to train it. This is GB the Grace Blackwell Envy 72. We need a computer that does all of the simulations that I showed you earlier with Omniverse DSX. It basically is a digital twin for the robot to learn how to be a good robot and for the factory to essentially be a digital twin. That computer is the second computer, the omniverse computer. This computer has to be incredibly good at generative AI and it has to be good at computer graphics, sensor simulation, ray tracing, signal processing, this computer is called the omniverse computer. And once we train the model, simulate that AI inside a digital twin and that digital twin could be a digital twin of a factory as long as well as a whole bunch of digital twins of robots. Then you need to operate that robot. And this is the robotic computer. This is this one goes into a self-driving car. Half of it could go into a robot. Okay? Or you could actually have, you know, robots that are quite agile and quite quite fast in operations. And it might take two of these computers. And so this is the Thor Jetson Thor robotics computer. These three computers all run CUDA. And it makes it possible for us to advance physical AI. AI that understand the physical world, understand laws of physic, causality, permanence, you know, physical AI. We have incredible partners working with us to create the physical AI of factories. We're using it ourselves to create our factory in Texas. Now, once we create the robotic factory, we have a bunch of robots that are inside it. And these robots also need the physical AI applies physical AI and works inside the digital twin. Let's take a look at it. America is re-industrializing, reshoring manufacturing across every industry. In Houston, Texas, Foxcon is building a state-of-the-art robotic facility for manufacturing NVIDIA AI infrastructure systems. With labor shortages and skills gaps, digitalization, robotics, and physical AI are more important than ever. The factory is born digital in Omniverse. Foxcon engineers assemble their virtual factory in a seaman's digital twin solution developed on Omniverse Technologies. Every system, mechanical, electrical, plumbing, is validated before construction. Seaman's plant simulation runs design space exploration optimizations to identify ideal layout. When a bottleneck appears, engineers update the layout with changes managed by Seaman's team center. In Isaac sim, the same digital twin is used to train and simulate robot AIS. In the assembly area, fanic manipulators build GB300 tray modules by manual manipulators from FII and Skilled AI install bus bars into the trays and AMRs shuttle the trays to the test pods. Then Foxcon uses Omniverse for large-scale sensor simulation where robot AIs learn to work as a fleet. In Omniverse, vision AI agents built on NVIDIA Metropolis and Cosmos. Watch the fleets of robots and workers from above to monitor operations and alert Foxcon engineers of anomalies and safety violations. or even quality issues. And to train new employees, agents power interactive AI coaches for easy worker onboarding. The age of US re-industrialization is here with people and robots working together. That's the the future of manufacturing, the future of factories. I want to thank our partner Foxcon Young Leu, the CEO, is here, but all of these ecosystem partners make it possible for us to create the future of robotic factories. The factory is essentially a robot that's orchestrating robots to build things that are robotic. You know this is the amount of software necessary to do this is so intense that unless you could do it inside a digital twin to dis to plan it to design it to operate inside a digital twin the hopes of getting this to work is nearly impossible. I'm so happy to see also that Caterpillar, my friend Joe Joe Creed and his hundred-year-old company is also incorporating digital twins and the way they manufacture. Um, these factories will have future robotic systems and one of the most advanced is figure. Brett Atco is here today. He just he founded a company three and a half years ago. They're worth almost $40 billion. Today we're working together in training the the AI, training the robot, simulating the robot and of course the robotic computer that goes into figure really amazing. Uh I had the benefit of seeing it. Uh it's really quite quite extraordinary. It is very likely that humano robots and my friend Elon is also working on this that this is likely going to be one of the largest consumer new consumer electronics markets and surely one of the largest industrial equipment market. Peggy Johnson and the folks at Agility are working with us on robots for warehouse automation. The folks at Johnson Johnson working with us again training the robot, simulating it in digital twins and also operating the robot. These Johnson surgical robots are even going to perform surgery that are completely noninv noninvasive surgery at a precision the world's never seen before. And of course, the cutest robot ever. The cutest robot ever, the Disney robot. And this is this is um something really close to our heart. We're working with Disney research on a entirely new framework and sim simulation platform uh based on revolutionary technology called Newton. And that Newton uh simulator makes it possible for the the robot to learn how to be a good robot inside a physically aware, physically based environment. Let's take a look at it. [Music] Amit Palunteer and figure in the same video.
>> That's wild.
>> Crazy, bro. Congratulations. That's awesome. Well,
>> Nvidia, you've been holding it since 2018. Alltime highs. [Music] Okay. [Music] Blue, ladies and gentlemen. Disney Blue. Tell me that's not adorable. He's not adorable. We all want one. We all want one. Now remember everything you were just seeing that is not animation. It's not a movie. It's a simulation. That simulation is an omniverse. Omniverse. The digital twin. So these digital twins of factories, digital twins of warehouses, digital twins of surgical rooms, digital twins where blue could learn how to manipulate and navigate and you know interact with the world. All completely done in real time. This is going to be the largest consumer electronics product line in the world. Some of them are just really working incredibly well now. This is the future of human or robotics and of course blue. Okay. Now, human robots is still in development. But meanwhile, there's one robot that is clearly at an inflection point and it is basically here and that is a robot on wheels. This is a robo taxi. A robo taxi is essentially an AI chauffeur. Now, one of the things that we're doing today, we're announcing the NVIDIA drive Hyperion. This is a big deal. We created this architecture so that every car company in the world could create cars, vehicles, could be commercial, could be passenger, could be dedicated to robo taxi. create vehicles that are robo taxi ready. The sensor suite with surround cameras and radars and LAR make it possible for us to achieve the highest level of surround cocoon sensor perception and redundancy necessary for the highest level of safety. Hyperion drive drive Hyperion is now designed into Lucid Mercedes-Benz my friend Ola Ken Canel Kenas um the folks at Stalantis and there are many other cars coming and once you have a basic standard platform then developers of AV systems and there's so many talented ones wave wabby Aurora Momenta Neuro there's so many of them we ride there's so many of them that can then take their AV V system and run it on the standard chassis. Basically, the standard chassis has now become a computing platform on wheels. And because it's standard and the sensor suite is comprehensive, all of them could deploy their AI to it. Let's take a quick look. [Music] Okay, that's the be that's beautiful San Francisco. And as you could see, as you could see, robo taxis inflection point is about to get here. And in the future, a trillion miles a year that are driven, a 100 million cars made each year. There's some 50 million taxis around the world. It's going to be augmented by a whole bunch of robo taxis. So, it's going to be a very large market to connect it and deploy it around the world. Today, we're announcing a partnership with Uber. Uber Dar Darra K Dara is going to we're working together to connect these Nvidia drive Hyperion cars into a global network and now in the future you'll you know be able to hail up one of these cars and the ecosystem is going to be incredibly rich and we'll have Hyperion or Robo taxi cars all over the world. This is going to be a new computing platform for us and I'm expecting it to be quite successful. Okay. So this is what we talked about today. We talked about a large large number of things we spoke about. Remember at the core of this is two or two platform transitions from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. NVIDIA CUDA and those suite of libraries called CUDA X has enabled us to address practically every industry and we're at the inflection point. It is now growing as a virtual cycle would suggest. The second inflection point is now upon us. The second platform transition AI from classical handwritten software to artificial intelligence. Two platform transitioning happening at the same time which is the reason why we're feeling such incredible growth. Quant quantum computing. We spoke about open models. spoke about we spoke about enterprise with crowd strike and uh Palunteer accelerating their platforms. Uh we spoke about robotics a new large potentially one of the largest consumer electronics and industrial manufacturing sectors and of course we spoke about 6G. Nvidia has new platforms for 6G. We call it ARC. We have a new platform for robotics cars. We call that Hyperion. We have new platforms even for factories. Two types of factories. The AI factory we call that DSX and then factories with AI we call that mega. And so now we're also manufacturing in America. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us today and thank you for allowing me to bring Thank Thank you for for allowing us to bring GTC to Washington DC. We're going to do it hopefully every year. And thank you all for your service and making America great again. Thank you.
>> Oh, that hits hard. That's nice.
>> Thank you.
>> Got to love Jensen, man. Thank you for making America great again. That was a little bit of a signal to a to a certain someone who controls the the China revenues for Nvidia. That's for sure.
>> He plays the political card so well. I mean, he brought it to Washington to be near Trump. You know what I mean? Like it he's just doing it amazingly. Okay. There was a lot of things to cover there, but honestly, it all boils down to the Palunteer comments. No, I'm kidding. uh to you maybe, but the the $500 billion in expected business over the next six quarters.
>> So, hold on. Is that confirmed? Did they like legit say that?
>> Yeah. Yeah. You you quoted Bloomberg on that. Jensen said it, bro.
>> Oh, I guess
>> he said it on stage.
>> Oh, so then Bloomberg was quoting Jensen. Okay, cool. So, that's So, so that's legit.
>> That's whenever the stock like really popped. You see those two uh or that huge candle? Well, I'm looking on the minutes, but um whenever it really popped, that was his comments.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. So, do you think the street didn't think they were going to have that much in revenue? That was a surprise basically.
>> Yeah. Yeah. That candle right there is whenever he said it. So, essentially from I I looked on the street or expectations from Wall Street, they're expecting about 380 billion over the next six quarters.
>> Oh my.
>> So, he said 500 billion. and and that that he has insight into. You know, there could be a lot more than that.
>> Dude, I don't know, man. They hit 4.8 trillion. Uh we're actually pushing new highs. We just hit another high right now. One uh 9764.
>> 4.8 trillion. Yeah. I think it's eight more bucks for five trillion. And this is without China, I imagine, right?
>> Without China.
>> Wow. F. So that's that's 120 billion more than the street expected without the second largest economy.
>> Isn't that crazy?
>> This shit's going to 10 trillion, bro.
>> Yeah, we're we're pumping right now. One. Oh my god. We're really pumping, dude. 83 86. I I don't want to say 200 is around the corner. It looks like it is, but this is usually when Nvidia tends to get rejected, but maybe today is good enough for them to keep going. We're all having a great day today. I mean, you got your Palanteer shout out, the figure shout out. Insane.
>> Okay, so I I thought I thought GTC would be longer, so I I we I will we'll we'll stay here for like 10 more minutes and then I'll start an actual market close later. Um but wow, it's going for 198. I I think the big thing today is Jensen was Santa Claus. He pumped up quantum. He pumped up the data center plays, Cororeweave, Nebius, etc. He pumped up cyber security with Crowdstrike. He pumped up software with Palunteer. If then he pumped up Disney, I mean like he just contributed as much as he could to this entire ecosystem of companies by Uber, right? Every
>> Oh my gosh. He just ran through 198
>> 198. I mean, he really he was really Santa today, helping everyone out and the streets were warning it because not only did he help everyone out, he told the street you can expect 500 billion of revenue or not revenue, but of business.
>> Yeah. Yeah. It It's so funny, right? They He's so open about it. We are the most expensive chip on the market, but we have the lowest total cost of ownership. and and if you're willing to pay us upfront, you're going to get so much back in return because the quality of our chips is unrivaled. The like you said in the benchmarks, it's just a bunch of Nvidia chips comparing against each other. I mean, there's there's no one else on the list. That's not that's not actually true, but Nvidia is just doing very well. I uh
>> am looking at Nvidia at all-time highs. Shopify is my second largest position, all-time highs, and SoFi didn't start the day doing very well, but we're we're back up. So, my third largest position hit all-time highs today. That's a fun day, man.
>> Having a good time.
>> The general market momentum, I think, is also helping SoFi come back, which is which is nice to see. Was there any specific announcement that he made that really caught your attention or?
>> Um, not I I I wouldn't say so. I mean, uh, we knew about the telco stuff before. Um, we knew about the Uber deal. That was kind of weird. They they announced the Uber deal, then they took it off X really quick, but it was already out there, so everyone knew about it.
>> Um, I don't think there was anything that was too crazy.
>> The the Department of Energy 7
>> that was new. You're right. Yeah,
>> that was new.
>> Yeah.
>> Seven uh supercomputer developments that they're doing.
>> Yep.
>> That was definitely new. The 500 billion though, just just the the the general size of everything was very large. And I think because this is actually crazy. I don't know if you saw online this whole scam live stream.
>> Oh, we we got scammed by it almost, bro. Like,
>> yeah, there's a big QR code on it. But if you look, I think there's been hundreds of thousands of dollars. So, um, that have been stolen that they say, "Hey, you know, put your Yeah, sorry. $170,000 have been given to these wallets on this scam thing." And I honestly think it's cuz they started late.
>> Yeah, cuz we almost clicked it. I mean, we clicked it for like two seconds because we thought And then they used the deep fake of Jensen. Um, wow. This is quite incredible. Okay, so where do we go from here? You've got Nvidia pumping all-time highs. You've got rate cuts coming tomorrow. You've got $500 billion of new business XChina, which really is going to have to get a lot of upgrades from the street. I mean, HSBC was probably right when they called for 320. Um, and then you've got all these smaller plays that Jensen mentioned as like key pivotal partners to building out data centers. I guess the momentum is on the side of a lot of this AI capex buildout that's not slowing down.
>> Yeah. Yeah,
>> dude. Amazon's even pumping. I'm not I mean I don't know if it's because of Jensen, but we're breaking 230 here.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we've we've been buying. I mean, um it's a great name. I don't know. I don't see how Amazon is not just one of the largest winners in AI, robotics, full self-driving. Like, they're the largest uh you know, cloud provider. They're just in every single area that Nvidia is working on and essentially where tech is going right now. They they deal in some part of like I'm a big fan of Amazon. Yeah, you got Amazon moving. Cory was at 120 last week. It's at 140. Neb was at 94. Back to 120. Uh Nokia, this one got a hell of a pump. 26% for new networking solutions.
>> How much were they at? What did they spike at today? Uh they were at 6:20 before the announcement,
>> but they got to 8 8:119 at one point or
>> they Yeah, they got to 819. Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, dude.
>> I'm uh I I I remain bullish. I've got nothing to um nothing to dislike during this announcement. Jensen was on fire. The stock loved them. And we're pushing into alltime highs once again. 19825. It was so funny about this. My dad the other night, he's like, "Can I sell Nvidia?" I was like, "Why?" He's like, "It goes goes to 190, then 180, then 185, then 175, then he's like, I don't see the value of it." He doesn't know what Nvidia is. I'm like, "Dad, I I think you should just keep it." He's like, "I want to sell it. I'm going to ask him tonight. Do you still want to sell it or do you want to hold it?" All right. 199 resistance. By the way, folks, it is uh 126,000 shares.
>> It It really did sit in that range for a while, though. I mean, we sat in that 180 range for, you know, from July till just recently here in October.
>> That's correct.
>> So, it was a lot of waiting. But honestly, I think that actually kind of pushes down the spring of whenever we actually do have a pop because their sales cycle is continuing. I mean, we're about to see this week, you know, uh, Wednesday and Thursday, all the big tech names talk about how much capex is, not only how much they spent this quarter, but how much they're going to accelerate into the quarters, uh, like like the next quarters that they're going to show off. So, to a large degree, that goes directly into Nvidia's pocket. That is what Jensen on stage has very you know clear insight into seeing hey you know what we're talking with Mark Zuckerberg I'm talking with Andy Jasse I'm talking with all these Satia Nadella and Sundar I see $500 billion coming in the next six quarters and that's not including gaming revenue or automotive or any of the other sectors that hopefully also have you know additional pops that's just data center revenue you.
>> I agree. I mean, this is an entire technological ecosystem that is being built out and it looks like there's a lot more time in the quote unquote cycle and it's not just 12 months and that's why it's also exciting. Open AAI Sam Alman aims to cuss cost cut costs to around $25 billion per gigawatt over a fiveyear cycle. Didn't Jensen say it's like 40 billion per gigawatt? Okay, so you got
>> uh OpenAI is live streaming right now, so that's why they're probably putting out some of those comments.
>> Open a uh aims to cut cost to around 20 billion per gigawatt. Yeah, that that's pretty crazy.
>> It's not going to be easy to get it. They're going to have to get some really good deals to to get it to those levels. Um okay, so Nvidia right here 197. Tanner, I want you to guess in the chat as well. How many shares do you think are waiting to be sold at $200 for Nvidia to break through?
>> Oh, bro. I I I've got zero idea.
>> You have to guess. How many people do you think have a sell order ready at 200 for Nvidia to move up?
>> I I wouldn't even be able to get into the ballpark. It's not even something I watch.
>> I wouldn't even be able to guess.
>> The answer is a couple of you guys got it. 1 million 54,000. So, someone's gonna have to buy $200 million of Nvidia to get this thing to get above 200. So, it's it's gonna have some resistance, but
>> you got a couple viewers that could do you that favor. No,
>> who knows? Maybe 3% move on Nvidia.
>> Yeah. Where's Triple V when you need them? Do me a favor. Buy some Nvidia, please.
>> All right. So, this is a uh this is a pretty big day. I'm sure we'll have a lot more to talk about it throughout the rest of the day. Uh, real quick for you, the Microsoft Open AI partnership or announcement, do do you think that that is bullish broadly for AI that Microsoft now has a 27% stake?
>> Yeah, it was a very weird deal overall, but um, yeah, I mean, they also contracted to spend an additional $250 billion uh for Azure services. So, yeah, I think that it's it's beneficial for AI in general. I think Microsoft is the largest customer of Nvidia if I'm not mistaken.
>> Mic is that true. M I don't know that.
>> I think so. I think Microsoft's the largest customer.
>> Okay.
>> If it's not, who is it?
>> That's a good question.
>> Who would it be? That's right.
>> Um All right, cool. So, that's what we have. We also have some China US headlines. I'll talk about all this in the market close. We got a bunch of earnings that we'll get into. US China set to reduce port fees on each other's ships. That's super bullish to reduce tensions. That's also probably helping Nvidia pump if Nvidia chips might be included in any trade deal. So that is really good news for Nvidia and for the broader market. Tanner, before we leave and we end the stream, can we just do it one more time?
>> What?
>> You know what?
>> I don't know what we we we have to spend the minute 15 seconds and watch it one more time. We have to watch it.
>> Yes. Okay. Sure. Go ahead.
>> We just have to. This was we just have to
>> this is the single fastest enterprise enterprise company in the world. Probably the single most important enterprise stack in the world today. Palunteer ontology. Anybody from Palunteer here? Bro, when you guys heard that, what was your raw reaction? What were you doing? Were you like making lunch or were you in the bathroom? Were you like moving stuff around the house? Like what were you doing when you heard it? And what was your reaction as soon as you heard them him finally finally it's been four years he finally said Palanteer publicly on stage?
>> Well, your reaction was a little bit um over the top.
>> No, it my reaction was genu you people care about authenticity. I authentically told them what was happening when when I heard that's all
>> turned your camera off and then
>> came back five minutes later.
>> You know, sometimes you gota you got to do what you got to do. was just talking to Alex earlier. This is Palenter ontology. They take information, they take data, they take human judgment and they turn it into business insight. We work with Palunteer to accelerate everything Palunteer does so that we could do data processing data processing at a much much larger scale and more speed whether it's structured data of the past and of course we'll have structured data, human recorded data, unstructured data and process that data for our government, for national security and for enterprises around the world. process that data at speed of light and to find insight from it. This is what it's going to look like in the future. Palunteer is going to integrate NVIDIA so that we could process at the speed of light and at extraordinary scale. Okay, Nvidia and Palunteer. [Applause]
>> That is that was that was cool. That was a moment.
>> It was definitely cool. It was very cool.
>> It's pretty dope.
>> Yeah. Um we should wrap this though. I want to hear what the heck happened at uh at PayPal. I mean, from everything I heard, it was a pretty great quarter. And OpenAI deal uh that ended up getting signed also seems pretty interesting. So, I want to take a look at that. But
>> if I had to pick which which name should be running more, it's SoFi. We'll see.
>> Oh, big surprise,
>> man. I Yeah, right.
>> Wow. If you have to pick one name that should be going high, it's Yeah,
>> we were down 3% at one point. What part of the quarter, you know, brings it red? I don't understand that.
>> Well, dude, I mean, it's recovering. It's not like it's uh stuck at 28. That was I think that was a lot of alos at that moment. But
>> this the street freaking hates this company. They actually hate it.
>> I don't know.
>> It was a good quarter. That's all we can say, right? It was a good quarter and hope that continues. Nvidia right here 19830.
>> I mean I don't know if she pushes 200 but it looks like she's going to try. It looks like she is going to try.
>> You going to sell at 200?
>> No. Are you going to sell at 200?
>> Not a chance.
>> I feel like I' I've thought about selling Nvidia before because I bought it at 120, right? So now I'm up like 60. thought about it before but then I'm just like if I sell it what other because I to me Nvidia I don't own Nebas I don't own Core Weeble all that stuff and maybe I do in 26 the way I justify well I own Nvidia so I tell myself like maybe there's more alpha there but there's less risk in Nvidia and it's freaking Nvidia so I tell myself like over the next five years if I want data center allocation until I really deep dive into all these smaller companies that people were you know lucky enough and and quite frankly smart enough to get into back when it was like 10 bucks on a lot of these names that have now exploded. I missed all those. So, for me to pick those names up after they four or 5x, I'm not opposed to it. I just need to really be confident in the names or I could just have more invidia right now.
>> Yeah.
>> So, I feel like that's the that's
>> you you bought at 177, you said.
>> Yeah, I bought at 177 on Friday, which is rude. They, as you said, it was stuck in that trend from 170 to 185 for basically five months. got a little bit of a breakout over 195, then it got hit back down, and now I'm not saying it's not going to go below 190. Obviously, anything is possible, but there's a little bit of a margin of safety for it to if it fell below 190, we would say, "Oh, wow. That's a that's a pretty big dip for Nvidia, right?"
>> Well, it's not the first time that uh Jensen Wong has come out and said that he believes that analysts are way behind on their targets. Like, I mean, he just had a conversation with Brad Gersonner. He talked about this. Didn't seem to reflect in the stock at all. So I do think that there's still going to be some skepticism until we actually see the numbers and if we do end up seeing positive US China relations and somehow Nvidia can weasle themselves back in whether that's with a you know B30 chip or something like this. I think this company just explodes higher. I mean, the the the couple of analysts that have been brave enough to put $300 plus dollar price targets on the stock, I think they'll be sitting pretty
>> correct. They're going to be getting some fat bonuses from their investment firms because you really have to go out on a limb and go out and say it like it deserves to be above 300. Only two of them, HSBC and I think Caner have said it so far.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Let's hope that uh SoFi stays above 31. My my call was at the end of the day that we close 3150. So, let's if it if that happens, I'm happy. I don't need to see a 10% jump in the day. Um, but yeah. Uh, someone said, "Do you think it's time to sell AMD and load Nvidia?" I I don't know why people are saying this is bearish AMD. Like, I feel like this is such a massive tailwind for the entire sector. Today is more focused on Nvidia because it's their event, but I do not see the reason to get overly excited about Nvidia and bearish the other names. I feel like this is a broad tailwind across the industry. Some names will be better than others, but at the end of the day, having exposure to the industry is what matters. And if you've been in AMD for a while, I don't know what Nvidia has said to make you be like, "Oh, I need to transition to Nvidia." It's like, "No, you're in AMD, then you're in AMD. Maybe you can buy more Nvidia, but I don't think the trade-off necessarily has to happen."
>> Yeah. Yeah. I I I think that um I I'm not bearish on AMD. I I just I know Nvidia a little bit better. I've been an investor in Nvidia for a while, so I feel more comfortable in that name. But this is just a broad sector increase. It almost feels like whenever AI early days like OpenAI was doing their thing and then Gemini would come out with the model and then you'd see all the articles that come out and say Chat GPT is dead and then Grock comes out and everyone says Gemini and Chacht are dead. It's like no, they're all pushing forward. It's just Nvidia's day right now. AMD is going to end up showing off new chips, new products, new partnerships, and then everyone's going to say that Nvidia is dead. The truth is they there's so much total addressable market to go around
>> the fact has a chance.
>> Yeah. I mean Qualcomm got a bunch of upgrades yesterday. The fact that an ETF is up almost 50% like SMH semiconductor up 48%. S&P is up 18. It's quite incredible. It means the whole sector has momentum.
>> The market's expected to continue to grow at 50% compounded annual growth rate. If that happens, it might be justified.
>> I agree. And again, this is much more important than just interest rates and inflation. That stuff matters. But I think a lot of the the bulls from the AI perspective have been saying this is something you have to understand the technology for, not just macro dam. And I think that's what Jensen's been saying for the past couple years as well. So, all right. Thank you everybody for being here. Tanner, thank you as well. Um, for those that don't follow Tanner and you're on my channel, I'm linking his YouTube right here. Especially if you're interested in SoFi. You can check them out. Uh, I'll be live again on the close. We got a bunch of earnings we'll cover and yeah, we'll talk through all the announcements we got from Nvidia today as well.
>> A lot of BMR and crypto talk on my channel lately for sure. Well, ETH especially, not not crypto in general, but ETH.
>> There I if if you had to pick two super cycle, do you still think that it's AI and crypto or is there another thing happening that you're more bullish on than those two, you know, sectors right now?
>> It's a great question. It's a great I mean the third super cycle I can't even really rationalize what I mean yeah energy I kind of lump in energy with AI though because the only reason energy is in demand is because of these data centers robotics is also AI to me so
>> yeah yeah they're so large it's almost like saying technology is the the big boom
>> yeah a lot of people asking about a deep dive on the the Bitcoin miners turn data centers I'm working on it. I'm I'm doing Nebas first, but I am working on Iran, Cipher. I'm trying to really go through their numbers because I'm thinking of like potentially throwing a little bit into each of them for 2026, even if I don't go bigger in one. So, we will have a lot of content on that soon, hopefully in the next couple weeks, and we'll talk more about it.
>> Yeah. No, I think
>> housing, there's a lot of good ones actually in chat.
>> Space is a big one. The quantum, I mean, Jensen spent 25 it felt like 25 minutes. said that's be 20 to 25 talking about quantum and eight months ago he said quantum is what 10 20 years away so you got a bit of a pivot here and I'm I'm curious the motivation for the pivot and the way he explained it was CPUs or sorry QPUs and GPUs can work together very similar to this argument that pounder made about KLMs right we don't have to pick whichever LLM it's you integrate them through the ontology he's saying to to run these parallel systems together you're going to need GPUs as well So, he kind of just said, "We can be friends. We don't have to be foes. We don't have it doesn't have to be antagonistic." And resolved a lot of the concerns that some people had potentially over the past couple months.
>> Yeah,
>> Tana's looking at SoFi. He's like, I don't give a [ __ ]
>> I am. I'm I'm actively looking at Soi.
>> There's a nice green candle. I'm I'm having some fun over here.
>> What if it goes 35 end of day, bro? What if it happens? What if
>> it might be the greatest day year to date for me? Um,
>> wait. Oh, yeah. Today. Oh, your portfolio has to You have Amazon, SoFi, and Nvidia
>> and Shopify.
>> Oh, and and shops alltime highs as well, right? Yeah,
>> dude.
>> So, my my three big positions are uh Nvidia, Shopify, SoFi. So,
>> wait, that your three bigs are Nvidia, Shopify, and SoFi?
>> Yeah, in that order.
>> Oh, you must be having a fun day, bro.
>> Yeah.
>> You're gonna You're going to go do what I did when I heard Palunteer from Jensen.
>> Okay.
>> Yeah. That's why I'm trying to get off this stream, dude.
>> All right. Thank you everybody. We'll see you guys on the market close. Bye, everybody. Have a good one.
