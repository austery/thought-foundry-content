welcome to in good company today we are diving into the world of batteries renewable energy Innovative technology with Peter Carlson the CEO of nwal thank you now Peter what is nwal nwal is uh um battery company that focus on develop uh uh the most sustainable products uh in the industry one of the things we recognize is that batteries and Battery Supply chains are uh in incredibly energy intensive uh and and as such uh they're also actually producing a significant carbon footprint and uh what we want to uh show uh is is that there is an uh there is another way by building sustainable uh Supply chains by building uh Factory setups uh in Grid uh solutions that actually provide renewable energy and doing it with with the latest technology uh incl including building circular um a circular setup that we can drive this battery revolution in a more sustainable way and thereby we we get a a significantly bigger impact on the green transition now you got some really wonderfully hairy goals yeah I love it where are you going to be in 10 years time I think in in 10 years time we will be uh an entirely you know fully circular company uh we will probably at least have uh 50% of of everything that we produce we will produce with recycled material I think we build out um our footprint uh to be kind of the the Western leader uh both in Europe in in North America and then with with sodium ion uh which is a new emerging technology I think we are rapidly evolving a footprint in uh if I call it the the developing World India Middle East uh Africa when you started nwal in 2016 many people in the industry didn't think you had a chance but wow here we are and you know the factory you are building you can see on Google Earth that's how big it is now one of the reasons why they you were skeptical was because of Chinese competition so what are the the challenges you are facing here the Chinese ecosystem and and this is uh you know batteries is a scale business uh it is big or go home generally A good rule in life yeah that is that is true but the Chinese has a you know they have a 5 to 10 year head start on uh scale which we need to catch up but they have from the vehicles to the battery supply chain uh to the battery value chain taken a very strategic position they have put in uh a large amount of capitals in in everything from raw materials mining uh up until really a very very clear transition plan towards uh electrification and then you know they're you know formidable in running operation so you know a head-to-head competition with the Chinese is going to be difficult what we are trying to do is is that we can do it in a different way we can uh you know we can stretch the technology uh we can do it in a more circular way uh and we can build build customization and and customer intimacy because batteries are going from kind of being commodity you know five six years when when we went out to U many of our customers they were thinking as battery as a black box and and today as this Market evolves we we see that uh the battery you know it's a chemistry system and and as a chemistry system you can basically optimize that towards the features that your products want to be and that your brand have as as an aspiration and what we perhaps have been a little bit better than than some of our our competitors is to work together with with our customers engineering groups on that optimization you know if you're a Volvo you sell a lot of uh uh cars in in the northern hemisphere so cold weather performance is a key feature for for a battery if you're a Porsche you know your customers don't want to stand waiting long at at at the charging station they really want fast charging so that kind of intimacy and optimizing the systems is also something that that we uh see this is where we can really differentiate so what do you actually need to be successful here I mean if I now decided to start a battery Factory and we have had some attempts or we have some attempts on you know to start startup in no way what what are the key things there is it is it money technology people just how how would you rank them starting point is obviously you need a really really good core Engineering in terms of how you optimize that that chemistry system is is that people or is that property can you can you buy that not not really you know in in a similar way as as with with many others these R&D architects who has the full visibility of of both how to optimize a chemistry system but can also understand how it affect the process and and the manufacturing setup they are worth their weight in in Gold um as a first mover with with a a very clear impact Mission we were able to recruit a handful of of of these people primarily from from Asia then we've filled up with with uh people from all over uh the world but that's kind of the starting point and and it is still a very emerging uh technology ology so I would say there's probably less than 100 people in the world it's rapidly growing that that have that full system overview and they are are so important then you know again coming back to that this is a scale business then you need to be able to attract Talent at scale what does that mean how many people is that well I mean we've grown from from 25 to 6,000 people in the last 6 years but what I would say is is you know per Factory you need a process engineering team that is very very talented and and I think you need to be somewhere around three to 400 you know really good process Engineers per Factory setup so that Talent base that is is crucial uh to bring bring on and and this is a big big bottleneck uh for for the industry right now then obviously you need the capital base so you need to have strong investors like yourself and how much money do you need as a rule of thumb you you basically need somewhere between 70 to 90 million US dollar per gigawatt hour that that you're investing and in order to make scale uh and and to become uh significant uh we think that you you need to reach at least somewhere between um 200 to 300 gwatt hours so if you do the math how much money is that that is somewhere around 20 to to 30 billion give or take 20 to 25 billion dollars over time this is not for the poor people this is not for the the poor people and then of course you need a scalable footprint you you need a way of of uh uh setting up your your lines and your factories that is systematic that can be scaled in in an efficient way so people capital and the scalable blueprint I think that is is uh you know the core you mentioned the the client relationships um you have a a great relationship Volvo um Volkswagen Porsche I met the U the CEO recently who's really excited about this uh how important are these relationships and the contracts you have they are essential on so if you if you didn't have any contracts you you couldn't go ahead no you couldn't excuse me but are these not pretty indifferentiation products can't I just produce loads of batteries and sell it to want to have them there is a commodity Market H you know you can buy 280 amp hour lfp batteries at the very very low cost today from China but if if you want to design a Leading Edge vehicle to to be head-to-head in competition with with Tesla and and some of the others then you really need high performance battery highly defined towards your uh brand and and and your uh performance optimizations and and those are not Commodities I mean obviously we are fighting head-to-head with with catl and LG and Samsung in in those those rfqs but but uh uh through these these relationships that we managed to build this has been crucial also to get our investors comfortable that we will not go the way solar cells went and and where where uh the Western kind of lost uh all those operations to to uh to Asia you worked at Tesla for some time what did you learn and what are what are you bringing to norwal I I learned a lot I must say when I came to to Tesla I felt uh that I was a you know a Prett pretty seasoned supply chain and operation uh guy you know worked with mobile phones for for a long period of time I worked with with with semiconductors but coming in to a startup where you build you know the rail in front of the the train uh and and where you constantly need to challenge and your strongest assets is your speed and your mission you really really stretch your comfort zone and and Elon for sure stretched my my comfort zone with what did you learn from him what I learned from him is is how powerful it is to drive a company with with a super super clear Mission You could argue about management methods but you can't argue about the mission and that is giving an incredible passion among people and loyalty then he always challenged the conventional way why should ocean sea sea Freight be slower why can't it be faster I still remember one uh it was one time we were looking at the cost of the modess and and we were having you were in a same room with him yeah yeah I mean we you know we met weekly and in the beginning we were basically giving away a check with with every vehicle that we we produced and the Elon uh told me you know I would like the entire bill of material to be analyzed based on the cost of athoms for every part and and you know a vehicle is like just a bill of materials like 3,000 500 port numbers and and you know to analyze the cost of the atoms I mean it blew me away it's like holy how do I do this but we got the team to work through and a couple of weeks later we we came back and and it was actually a whole bunch of of different learnings about what is the cost of atoms for steering gear and and what is the the sales price and and does it make sense we learned a lot and and you know I would not be here today I would not have dared to start norfold if I haven't been on on on that Journey do you also have a reality Distortion field yes I I I I think I'm sometimes I'm I'm a little bit naive in in what I think we we we can uh we can do so give me some examples of where you are kind of asking for the impossible and where it is actually happening sometimes too whenever I see a budget or whenever I see a timeline I always think there there must be ways to cut this 30 40% there must be smarter ways uh uh to drive uh uh the capital uh structure Etc so I I I have a an inherent uh you know push to to see where is the boundary where can I stretch and at the end many times we're not reaching that that stretch but we're still reaching towards something that was was better than than what we started with and and that is is of course very very important when you are in in any type of of Industry to continuously stretch you know can you do this a little bit faster can you do this a little bit uh uh more effective uh can we do it with a little bit less people uh Etc and how does this work in in the Nordic region and in Sweden I mean are we are we fast enough are we efficient enough uh do we have are there too many regulations and rules I I do think there is too many uh regulations and and and and rules in an early stage you know you you you're 50 to 100 people you you work around the clock but then when you're starting to scale up and when you're starting you know then you know you have to it's basically impossible to to operate in in Sweden without the collective bargaining agreement Al musk tried yeah I mean I mean it's tried and that is it is an interesting dispute because I'm I'm not sure who is going to budge first uh uh to be honest and and it's not easy to see how you will find a a win win in in in that situation but but you have a situation where if you're building a company and if you're starting up you know new Factor especially if new factories that haven't been built before that's not done in in a 9 to5 environment you know you need extra flexibility from people and and normally people are willing to uh to give that you know it doesn't need to be demanded normally you can get it on a voluntary basis and then when you're trying to to convert this into you know how does this adhere with with the collective bargaining agreement you know this you you you you stumble into a whole bunch of of bottlenecks with with the central organization because they are basically saying you know it's not that they don't understand what you need but they are of course worried if we give this flexibility to you immediately a Volvo or an ABB will start and come for for for the same and and we get stuck to some extent in in in our uh regulation I think actually it is time to a little bit review some of these these structures we we have because nothing comes for free succeeding also requires hard work and as long as it is a mutual understanding why not but you know why not allow people to to to work specifically during a uh uh a certain period of of of time when when you need that so which part of the structure kind of the scandavian model is it that you think we need to review I think we we need to to allow more flexible working hours in Norway in Sweden a lot of our industrial infrastructure was built long ago and and and it wasn't built you know by by 9 to5 and if you look at at our competition that that that is being built in in in China you know to take an example I was visiting one of our competitors uh and and we were walking through their Factory and and I was kind of you know is it free shift structure or is it the four shift structure and there was a this is a two- shift structure structure so we have two teams uh 12 hours a day six days a week and then you know flexible over times on on on Sunday we are competing with with a five shift structure in order to to uh to fill uh the factory I'm not saying that that we should go to towards the Chinese model but what I do say is is that if if people wants to make a bigger impact if they want to to to work uh a bit more also making more more money uh we should have a bit more flexibility for that is that why you are starting factories outside Sweden no it is not the reason why we're doing that is both proximity to customers but it's but it's also you know access to Talent base we have recognized that know at least short term with what we're doing in vest Ros what we're doing in Ino and what we're doing in gothenberg we are draining a lot of uh the capabilities uh of and the talent base that is in the in the surrounding so so it is driven by other uh other reasons moving on to the whole battery Market um you say that batter is the key technology to replace the use of coal and gas why could you elaborate a bit on that for example if if Europe should should meet our our our Paris treaty obl obligations which is basically 80% CO2 reduction over over three decades we basically both need to to get uh oil out of our transport a little bit more difficult with airplanes but but with most of our transports is absolutely doable but then it needs to be replaced by by electrification maybe some hydrogen but but primarily uh which is you know also driving an electrical uh powertrain but but primarily uh it's going to be batteries uh and in the same way if we want to transform our our we also need to transform our energy generation from natural gas and coal and oil and and and we need to build a new uh infrastructure with renewable you know Norway and Sweden have the hydrop power that is is crucial in in this but then it is wind and solar and there's probably a certain part also of of of of nuclear but all of these will create more and more instability in the in in the grid which means that that your ability to store energy to to balance this in the grid is also becoming crucial and you also have the situation where we're sitting here in Stockholm today Stockholm has basically an infrastructure I think it is around three and a half uh, megawatts that's the copper cables that comes into to to the city this is maxed out between 9 and 2:00 in the day and and with all people that is now transforming into electric vehicles coming in from the suburbs uh you know want to charge the the vehicle during the day and and and and get back we probably need to to uh uh to create an additional maybe 50% increase during peak hour and we can either do it by by digging up the entire city and and you know pump in uh copper or we can build energy storage in in in the CI so that we can fill that up during the the night and we can utilize it during uh during the peak hour and I think the the the later one is is going to be a much more efficient model for how we develop that so the the ability to store energy is is absolutely crucial in the in the transition now um historically we've been dependent on lithium where which you find in places like Argentina Chile and and China but not in Europe so what are the challenges here it's not the challenge about uh access in the sense that that lithium is very available on Earth the easier access is either by rock where Canada Australia is is uh for example is is really big but we have it in Serbia we have it in Portugal and in other locations then you have groundwater that has a strong lithium uh uh content and and there for example South South America where you pump up and and you you're basically evaporate in big uh big brins this uh industry is is evolving uh very fast I have a little bit of of a concern over you know creating these these big dams uh in in in the desert over time I think this will have a a pretty big environmental impact but there is also new technology em emerging around uh so so-called drri uh so where you you do direct reduction without these spres so I think technology will will solve it part of the challenge today is that almost all of of these this lithium if I call it a early concentration form then goes to to China to be processed into either lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide so so you know the whole uh value or the processing part uh I think is somewhere between 80 to 85% of the the world's production is in in uh in in China so that's that's an advantage that China these producers have it is an advantage and and this is where we we need to build value chains um you know we started a joint venture in Portugal together with galp to build one of Europe's first lithium processing and and this is a necessity to build these these supply chain because eventually batteries will be a a regional business batteries are so heavy they are a bit dangerous to transport and the customers would like to have just in time uh setups so so there will be a regionalization of the market and and as part of that regionalization it's super crucial to build also these Regional Supply chains do every country have to have a battery production not every country needs to to have a does no way need to have it it's a good question I think Norway probably have the opportunity of having a good battery production given its grid setup but uh then there is a whole bunch of of other things that needs to come together for for that to happen but in reality over the next I would say next couple of years most of the decisions uh that will drive the transformation of the entire Auto industry will be be taken where is my key strategies for for for battery supplies then it will take 10 years to execute them but it is very important that Europe as total is on our toes because if we don't have this infrastructure in the next decade then the train have gone uh and and then the infrastructure is is built up and it's so much Capital that it's going to be very difficult to to uh to change this so then we would be in a situation like we have been in solar panels microchips and so on right exactly tell me about the new sodium I am breakthrough you've had sodium ion has been in in research for for for quite quite some some time uh as it is probably the you know the second best to lithium and it's even more abundant from a norfold perspective one of the things that that we've seen over uh over the last couple of years is is you know in the drive for lower cost batteries which is necessary for even higher Market penetration and with very fluctuating uh raw material prices lithium ion phosphate so so iron based batteries have grown uh a lot driven by a very very uh rapid and and efficient uh execution of of uh of of the uh the Chinese it is roughly half the energy density of high performance uh nickel batteries but for energy storage and for lower cost Passenger cars it it works and obviously as as a company you're sitting and seeing that and you're kind of you know should we should we address that uh that market what should be our strategy we've been struggling with with how to approach this I must admit both that we would be almost 100% dependent on Chinese active material and the fact that this active material would come with a very large uh carbon footprint so it would be very difficult to how do we combine our mission with with this type of of technology and lastly these lfp batteries as they're less valuable there hasn't been a natural development of of recycling methodology it's coming but it's also going to require more regulatory demands in order for for for that to to to make make it happen when can you have a big production of this we are right now working on our industrialization plan for for this um uh and and we think we can scale this up in the 2026 20 uh 27 uh Ty of time frame will this be a unique product or will all companies have well you know there is a raise on on sodium what is a bit unique uh is is that I think we were a bit ahead of the competition in being able to uh uh to develop um based on on this pran blue cathode to produce an lfp type performance competition is is either working with an iron based uh uh uh cathod material that has lower uh lower energy density or they working with with a nickel-based cathode so then H but what we've what we've shown is is that we can do a product without without both and and this I think is is a big Edge what what is also very interesting with sodium ion batteries is that lithium is very reactive but but sodium you can basically uh heat up a sodium ion battery towards 300° without getting a thermal Runway so they are inherently safer which I think also becomes very important you know in both harsh conditions if you're putting battery storage in the desert next to a solar farm or or if you're moving energy storage into cities and where where you know the fire hazard is is of course very very uh important one more thing you you touched on the importance of having this recyclable infrastructure as well parallel to your battery production how does this work basically the way it works is you're taking end of life packs and you're this manle them uh you remove copper and the you know the aluminum in in the pack and you discharge it and it seems simple but to take a battery pack to absolutely down to to zero is is not you know in industrial it's not that that novel then uh you basically crush and sort it where you need to take out the electrolyte that is very important and the end product of that is is black mass and out of that black mass you you can then either uh use pyro technology so you you use furnaces to to remove it but then you lose lithium or uh you can take the way that we've done where you're using a hydrometallurgical separation and then uh you can basically get over 90 towards 95% recyclability of nickel of cobalt but also of of U lithium do anybody else do this there is other uh companies who are uh evolving but we have been able to build a pretty strong IP base around this and and up in hfo we're right now commissioning Europe's largest recycling facility it's a 4 gwatt Hour setup and and there's a brilliant B bunch of of people who is now getting all these these processes uh uh to work moving on to corpor culture um pretty unique situation to build something from zero to 6,000 people in eight years how do you think about what type of culture you want to have in the company I'm a person that is um driven very much by by Passion and energy and and obviously it is a a company culture that reflects that is is very very important to me I you know uh when I step into room I'm very sensitive to the the energy level in in the room that is that is very important thermometer for me whether you know whether there is true activity going on I'm sorry and just just on and how do you measure that so now you come into a room what do you what do you gauge what do you what do you look for what you're looking for is can you feel the energy can you see people you know standing over uh together you know looking at at at something whether it's in a display whether it's a you know it's a prototype or or collectively you you can you can feel whether is an energy whether it's it's like a newsroom before the the the the nights uh you know 7:30 uh play or whether it's it's a Trader room in in in a stock market you know that type of of of energy so that that is important to me the other important uh thing and we worked a lot from day one and we kept the same uh the same kind of core Words which is being bold being passionate and and and being excellent as uh the key pillars of of of what we doing but one important thing when you're building something like this and that that we're driving that is you cannot run at maximum speeds all the time it doesn't work like like that but but when you're hitting a bottleneck that's when the light needs to be on that's when you need uh you know part of an organization to Sprint and that principle is very very important to me that that whenever we we stumble because it is still so speed and and the pace forward as as a as a company is one of our biggest assets who do you hire we have 125 nationalities in in the company so so we're very very diverse we want to hire uh people who have done difficult things who have multiple experiences that are not afraid to to roll up the sleeves and and shovel dirt we want to to hire people specifically that is logic but also Dynamic you say um speed is an asset now in our strategy document for the fund we have speed is a mindset how do you make sure that you keep the speed up do you walk around on the floor here and whip people Direction no I I think um I think it's it's incredibly important to constantly drive that that culture and and that is that is a challenge when when you're growing very very fast last year we were having a a kickoff uh with the first and second later the 50 people and and we realize that we have one group who's been with the company for three four five years and and they are you know totally engraved in in the culture but then we're starting new sites and we're bringing in more people it requires a bit of effort um uh to bring everybody else into what is it being a North Walter and and this is crucial what is it to be a North Walter well I come back to it is about being passionate it's about being bold and being excellent in what we're doing with with a strong focus on on what our customer uh need but it is a challenge when you're being proud of being this diverse but you also have to remember that that if you come from from 125 different nationalities your perspectives if you come from Asia on on how an organization Works versus the the Nordic model of being very flat and goal oriented this is a big mental transition and this won't happen over days so we work a lot with with both getting people together in big team buildings to so I I for instance hear that you have a weakness for CER challenges you got your whole Management Group to uh to do vasal lopit now for those of you who are not into CrossCountry skiing vasal lopa is a bit of a it's a pretty damn long uh cross country trip 90k right uh even the people who hadn't done it before cross country they had to do it so how did that go we haven't done it yet uh we're on the path uh and the velop is not the the the the important thing but basically what we said is with this Focus that we have on on the ramp up in the factories we will have our management teams up Ino on a weekly basis this is where the focus needs to be and as a little bit of a feature to being in kfo is is the availability of snow so Monday evenings after we have had our management meetings we we're doing a joint training on on CrossCountry skiing and we have this this excellent coach his name is Claus neelson he've won the nden H lopet which is the world's longest cross country it's 220 kilometers uh so he has been helping us and as as bringing the team together with one goal it's been uh it's been very very fun but we've started on very very different levels and perhaps um kind of suitable to go for something which is pretty Mar like because this is going to be a marathon to build not world it is a marathon for sure what are your leadership principles what is the most important thing for you I think it it is uh very very important in in order to to understand the problem to go to the depth whenever you have a problem don't just leave it at at face value the Japanese have this this saying Gamba gutsu go to the source and and and and see it and and I very much like that philosophy we're trying to find a model and I'm trying to apply a model where people are given a lot of responsibility and and I will leave them alone until they prove that they can't uh manage that that responsibility but I'm a strong believer in people I don't set the agendas for for for people and I'm very focused on on two things how they together with the team achieve their their objectives and secondly how they are building the teams around them you know how they're being Talent attractors when I'm having performance reviews these are the two parameters that is very very important for me when you make decisions how uh dependent are you on analysis and how much is pattern recognition are things you've seen before I think data is important because number of the things that we're doing is to some extent we're doing it for the first time but I'm also cognizant about you can go and collect data forever it is about having the sufficient amount of data so so that you're not going totally off the track but if you have 80% of what you need then I'm normally ready to take uh the decision and and and go on Now One former colleague of yours described you as optimistic bold forward leaning and aggressive so where does this come from what what is what is your driving force as with many of us there is a there is a little young achiever inside that want to do good that that want to learn and want to to uh want to succeed and then you know obviously wants to get a certain recognition for it I'm not driven by financials but I do like to get recognition it was interesting I gave a speech at the stomm school of Economics yesterday and uh and I asked people to put up their hand if they if they really you know wanted to show the world and surprisingly few people did and I suspect it's just because they didn't admit it want to admit it m who do you want to prove wrong who do you want to show yes in in in the sense I want to prove the ones that that is is saying that we can't solve this big problem the climate crisis and the green transition in in the timelines that that we we set up we we need to give ourselves more more time because the solutions to solve these problems is is there it is about you know executing them 2017 uh I I was out for for for an accident I was in in in an avalanche and and when they found me I I didn't uh I didn't breed so I I actually don't recall it uh uh until I was on a helicopter on the way to to hospital and I was in pretty bad shape but when I was recovering I was laying there and thinking what is important now then I got kind of a a second chance and then what came very very clear because I was also engaged in a whole bunch of of other startups this is my mission in life this is combining what I've learned through through my my career with my passion this will be hopefully the important effort of uh of my life sometimes you know when when you can feel a little bit almost overwhelmed you know what have I started I kind of go back to at the end of the day this is really really important if we should be able to contain climate uh and global warming to at least below uh two degrees we need to take these these dramatic rapid actions and we need to be bold did the Evar change your life in other ways it it did I think it made me much more humble to how fragile life can be and to make sure that you're not pushing all your wants to the Future and I can I can clearly say that that I would die tomorrow I would still you know be very happy with with the life uh I've had how do you relax you know one of the things that I think is is is a good feature when when you're an entrepreneur is as an entrepreneur you have a lot of shitty days where you're thinking we're not going forward we're going backwards and and you just get an aggregate of all the pile of that happens when you're building and and starting and new things but I have this this uh ability to feel like go to bed sleep and wake up with totally new energy it's like almost like a goldfish how much it uh does one have to take to be a good entrepreneur the harder task you take on the more pile of you will experience that is probably a a law of of some sort but I'm also a bit of an onoff person so we have a board meeting today but but later tonight I'm going to jump on the uh the train and and I'm going to go up to AA with my kids and I'm just going to focus on going skiing and and spending a weekend with them and go back a little bit refreshed here on on Monday lastly Peter what is your advice to young people uh I think it is uh super important to to follow your passion don't follow what other people tell you to do if you're not passionate about what what you're doing you're not going to put in that extra effort that is required to to to Really achieve uh excellence in the early days we were sitting in an attic in Stockholm a small team and we had a room where we put up favorite quotes there's two two quotes that still sticks out very much in in my mind one I think it's from the Google Founders is good idea is normally perceived as as not good at all until it's really good you know if you have an alternative you should never give up and and try and and when you've tried and proved that it works you're surrounding will will will recognize oh you know this was a really really great idea but but it takes a lot of effort to to to get there the second one was for from from Mike Tyson everybody got the strategy uh up until they went in and get the first punch in the face and that's really something you know what do you do then to continue going on when when you're constantly B in challenge that that is a very very important thing well Peter it for sure seems like you are following your passions and and I have to say I'm also thinking perhaps a few more of us need a tiny bit of avalanche to shake out the really important things in life so we can focus where it really matters but uh big thanks for taking the time and all the best of luck thank you
