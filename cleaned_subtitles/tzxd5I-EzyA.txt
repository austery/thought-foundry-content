Macroeconomics has not been successful
for 200 years.
I’ve noticed.
Exactly.
It's been a failure for 200 years.
No progress.
I think most economic ideas are bad ideas.
If t here's a group of people
that I can't stand,
it is economists driving me up the wall.
Mainly in a career,
I say don't do an economics degree.
Bashing economics, especially on popular
podcasts like Lex Fridman or Tucker
Carlson.
Can get you hundreds of thousands,
if not millions of views.
But are these criticisms fair,
or are they just
sensationalist nonsense
that's used to get views?
Hey, I'm Joeri, I have a Ph.D.
in economics and I used to teach economics
at several universities.
And today my employee, Alejandro here
who is also an economist, has selected
several popular video
clips with people ranging from professors
to YouTubers to investors
-bashing economics for me to react to.
And as I understood it, these criticisms
essentially come in three flavors.
Number one,
economics is not a hard or a real science.
Number two,
economic models are terribly outdated.
And number three, don't study
economics, It's a waste of time.
This is how Alejandro
ordered the clips for me.
So let's get into criticism type
number one.
Economists make bad predictions.
It's not a hard or real science.
You know
economics is not a physical science.
There's no way for me to go
and do an experiment and say here,
let's let's run the Covid economy again.
But with taxation on the rich and show
high living standards, you bet
we can't do that physical experiment.
All we can do is predict.
And that is why banks pay millions
of pounds a year to good predictors.
Because that's the best way
to tell who's a good economist,
because we can't do physical experiments.
And it drives me mad that these economists
who make policy and protect policy
that protects them and their class
and the rich don't even accept
when somebody consistently predicts them,
they won't even listen to you.
Drives me mad.
Okay, so popular YouTuber Gary,
an ex-trader makes two claims here.
Economics is not as good
as physical sciences.
And number two,
so this critique is not entirely true.
To make financial market predictions.
And therefore
he is actually a really good economist.
And yet economists like me
do not listen to him.
Okay, I see variants of these
two claims actually a lot
in the comment section on this channel.
Economics is not a very good science,
and you should really listen
to rich investors rather than economists.
So let me just address both of these once
and for all.
For the first claim,
I actually half agree with Gary.
Economics is a social science
which is less
good than a physical or hard science.
Let's play a part of that clip again.
And you know,
economics is not a physical science.
There's no way for me to go
and do an experiment and say, here,
let's let's run the Covid economy again.
Here,
he gets to an absolutely crucial point
about why economists, and especially macro
economists, can never get to
this scientific gold standard of doing
control experiments in the laboratory.
Yeah, that's the half that I agree with.
I'm pretty envious that,
for example, chemists can do super control
experiments in a lab.
Well, this is much harder
for social scientists like economists
like me, but also sociologists
or political scientists.
But I would argue that not being able
to do laboratory experiments
is actually a problem for many,
many natural systems as well,
given that they're big enough
not to fit in lab right?
Gary's Covid
economy is a macroeconomic phenomena.
If you just look at the UK
like Gary tends to do,
that means that we're talking
about millions of individuals,
millions of firms, hundreds of banks
interacting with government
and the central bank, as well as,
of course, other countries.
You cannot put the entire UK inside
a laboratory to do a controlled experiment
to compare the differences
between doing Covid stimulus
and not doing Covid stimulus,
like how medical scientists compare
a placebo group to a treatment group.
But this is true for big physical systems
as well.
You kind of put the Earth in a laboratory
to study the impact of greenhouse gases
on global warming.
You cannot put stars in a lab to study
how black holes are formed.
Therefore, you see in all of science
that the bigger the system gets,
the more difficult science becomes,
and the easier it is to criticize
the results of studies that use
mathematical models or statistical models,
or quasi experimental methods,
rather than real gold
standard controlled experiments.
However, even though natural scientists
also struggle with this problem,
I do agree with Gary
that even for these big systems,
social systems on average
are even more difficult to study
than very big natural systems
like the solar system, for two reasons.
The first reason is that social systems
simply tend to be more complex
than physical systems.
After all, atoms or chemicals
do not have a brain that can plan
ahead, learn, and react to its environment
like humans do.
Therefore, while economists
may do experiments in a laboratory,
just as chemists or biologists do,
the results from small scale controlled
human experiments are far less likely
to hold up in a real world
setting than those from a small scale
chemical experiment.
Similarly, on the big scale,
while macro economists are using more
and more experiments or so-called quasi
experimental methods that mimic
experiments, they still have to deal with
the fact that humans are inherently less
predictable than atoms or even animals.
To make matters worse,
there's this second reason
why social sciences struggle,
which is that unlike natural scientists,
social scientists are part of the system
that they study.
For example, about Gary's Covid economy,
most economists predicted that the world
would face a big recession or depression
with deflation rather than inflation.
However, because the government
actually listened to these economists,
they started massive stimulus programs
to avert a recession with deflation.
But they then created an economic boom
with lots of inflation.
This is a problem that natural scientists
do not have to deal with.
For example,
an asteroid does not change its course
because some physicists predict
that it will crash into a planet.
So Gary is right
economics is not a physical science,
making it harder to do experiments that
then help generate reliable predictions.
This is why on this channel,
I often try to stress that while I do
make some macroeconomic predictions,
they will typically not be very reliable.
This brings us to Gary's second
claim in that clip.
Let's watch it again.
And that is why banks pay millions
of pounds a year to good predictors,
because that's the best way to tell
who is a good economist,
because we can't do physical experiments.
And it drives me mad that these economists
who make policy and protect policy
that protects them and their class
and the rich don't even accept
when somebody consistently predicts them,
they won't even listen to them.
It drives me mad.
Okay, this is where Gary and I
truly, completely disagree.
I say nobody can make really good
macroeconomic predictions
because the system is so complex and
we can't study it’s dynamics in the lab.
But Gary says, hold on.
Banks paid people like me a lot of money
to make these types of predictions.
And I got rich.
And you academic economists did not.
So why don't economists
listen to people like Gary?
Well, the reason it is going to sound
really brutal, but actually is because
economists have found that they cannot
actually distinguish professional traders
like Gary from monkeys
throwing darts at a financial newspaper.
Okay, let me explain.
And please don't take this personal.
Gary, I personally believe
you were a very skilled trader
and I look at your predictions on YouTube
and they were pretty good.
You some point had six out of nine
or something like that were correct.
Gary, then to tell you about all the ones
that were correct a lot on this channel.
But yeah, he also got some stuff wrong,
like saying house prices would go up
quite a bit further
while they really didn't, and that Covid
would massively increase inequality,
while the data at least says that
that really was not the case.
Still six out of nine,
that's actually really good.
I said the system cannot be predicted,
so you'd probably expect
Gary would get about 50% or
so of his predictions.
Right?
And he clearly got more than 50%
just being a bit more right than wrong.
That's enough to make you a millionaire
in financial markets.
However, the problem is simply
that if enough people
bet on markets every day,
some people will, yes,
inevitably, statistically, always do
well for a couple of years.
This is why
there are actually serious experiments
where professional traders
like Gary get beaten by animals.
For example, there's a famous Wall Street
Journal supervised experiment
where a blindfolded monkey
beat professional traders.
To make matters worse, in 2012,
professional traders
like Gary were defeated by a cat
dropping a mouse toys on the stock market.
Suggestions.
In an experiment that lasted a full year,
and then more scientific experiments
with hundreds of simulated monkeys
selecting random stocks,
about 10% of monkeys
outperformed the market by over 940%.
Well, professional traders are famously
struggling to outperform the market
at all.
So sure, Gary's predictions
track record may seem impressive,
and it could be his impressive skills
as an economist.
Absolutely.
But at the end of the day,
there will always be some monkeys
that are better at predicting
than professional traders like Gary
or Ray Dalio or Cathie
Wood for that matter.
So this is why economists don't
even accept
when somebody consistently predicts them,
they won't even listen to them.
And instead, economic theories
need to be able to predict the future.
Yes, but they also need to be able
to explain hundreds
of years of economic history
at the same time, and also be confirmed
in quasi experimental studies.
That is a much higher standard than
just betting money on financial markets
going up or down for a couple of years,
which, as we have seen,
can be done by a lucky monkey as well.
So yeah, that was a very long response,
I realize.
So quick summary.
Yes, economic science is not as good
or reliable
as most natural sciences
because humans are unpredictable.
And to make matters worse,
they actually listen to economists,
which then makes economic predictions
sometimes not come true.
Yes, some rich traders
make good predictions for years.
And yes, it could be
that they're really good at economics.
But for us economists,
we cannot distinguish them
from monkeys
throwing darts at a financial newspaper.
So this is why economic theories
have to explain
the future and past
and be confirmed in experiments
which economists are doing more
and more often, which is great, right?
Economics is getting more scientific.
But of course, there's still plenty
that economists
can genuinely be criticized about.
And I will react to that.
After telling you about me getting three
very fair criticisms from my wife
about me and my academic ways,
and how today's video
sponsor Ekster helps me to address them.
First,
I am often criticized for ruining my look
by having this giant wallet
stick out of my pants.
Ekster fixed this by sending me
this super convenient slim wallet
and this even slimmer card holder
where cards pop out just like this
and where both are RFID protected,
come with lifetime
warranty, and there are several colors
for him and her.
Second, I've been criticized
for losing my stuff way too often,
potentially due
to thinking about economics all the time.
An extra fix this with this handy
finder card that I now have in my wallet.
Third, I don't know why,
but my clothes packing skills are terrible
and Ekster fixed this with this super
handy travel vacuum kit, which is great.
I will use it to compress my kids
holiday clothes for a vacation
because it keeps our bag super organized.
If any of these problems
sound recognizable,
or if you were looking for a great gift
for the holidays, I'm super
happy to say
that I have secured a 10% discount
on top of a sitewide 55% discount

after which we can move
to the second major criticism people
like to lob at economics, which is that
economic models are terribly outdated.
Okay, Alejandro told me
this was a clip from famous Bitcoin
investor Michael Saylor on the Lex Fridman
podcast.
Let's have a look.
Yeah, I think that if we're going
to want to really make
any scientific progress in economics,
we have to apply much,
much more computationally intensive
and richer forms of mathematics.
So if you want to describe
how anything works
in the real world, you have to start
with the concept of feedback.
If I double the price of something,
demand will fall and attempts to to create
supply will increase
and there will be a delay
before the capacity increases.
There'll be an end demand change,
and there will be rippling effects
throughout every other segment
of the economy, downstream
and upstream of such thing.
So it's kind of common sense.
But most economics,
most classical economics, it's always,
you know, taught with linear models,
you know, fairly simplistic linear models.
All right.
That was a really interesting clip
by Michael Saylor.
Because for me
it really encompasses ignorance.
That is a critique
that people often have about
economic models
is, look, they are too simple.
They're oversimplified.
And actually, that point I agree with.
I did my thesis on this very thing.
I explored this new modeling
technique exactly.
Something that Michael Saylor here
is talking about
agent based models,
computational agent based models.
And I made these massive models.
I coded them up,
simulated thousands of households
and hundreds of firms and tens of banks
and the government and central bank.
And what I found is that
this is a really useful technique
to study some phenomena in macroeconomics,
but there's also a huge downside to it,
and that is that the more complex
your model is, the more difficult
it is to actually understand
what's going on in the model, and the more
likely there will be some bugs,
just as you see in computer games,
with these models.
So to that point, I think Saylor is right
with this critique is very old.
I started my Phd
a lot of years ago, and in the meantime,
you know, central banks are working now
with a lot of these agent based
computational models alongside
many different modeling techniques,
alongside the more simple models
that Saylor here is critiquing.
But then for his critique
about these more simple models,
I don't think he knows
what he's talking about.
He's saying, look,
these models don't have feedback
like their general equilibrium models.
This what they call typically dynamics
stochastic general equilibrium
models are the most popular models
in macroeconomics.
They're dynamic okay.
They're talking about equilibrium,
about supply demand
being in in balance
with each other in equilibrium,
and how they react
if they become out of equilibrium
or if something happens to that,
and then they react back
and forth with each other.
And Michael Saylor is saying,
oh, economists don't follow this.
This is just a basic mistake like they do
while it it's at the heart of these
relatively simple models is supply
and demand is feedback.
And they are dynamic
that he's saying they're linear models.
They're not
dynamic stochastic general equilibrium
models are not linear models okay.
They're dynamic, but I think I know
where the confusion comes from
because some of these models
are solved in a linear way.
That's a mathematical trick
to make solving them easier.
And I think that's
what he's talking about.
But honestly, this guy doesn't know
much about economic models.
And he got very rich investing in Bitcoin.
And I'm not gonna criticize him for that.
But economic models no.
Someone who does know
a lot about economic models though,
and economics in general is Professor
Richard Werner,
which I think the next clip is from.
Well,
the reason is that the the economists
follow this theory that banks are just
financial intermediaries, that just,
you know, gather deposits here.
Do the analysis credit, in
analysis, you
know, risk assessment and, and all that.
And then they allocate the funds
and invest or they just take a percentage.
They're a -
So so they're intermediaries. Yes.
But that's wrong.
That's not what they are.
That's it's one theory of banking.
And it's still the one that still dominant
in all the
text books the leading journals.
They still use that
but actually, if you look into it, you
realize there's three theories of banking.
A second theory, slightly older,
that was dominant until the 1960s,
so-called fractional reserve theory.
And you may have heard
this fractional reserve, banking.
What is that?
Well,
this theory says this part is similar.
Each bank is a financial intermediary.
It just collects deposits and then does
the analysis lends out the money.
But in aggregate, as banks interact,
there's money creation.
Oh, and that's where students, yes,
should have bricked up money creation.
They even talk about money multiplier.
What.
That's the second theory.
Now there's a third theory.
And that one had been made out
to be a wacky conspiracy theory.
Oh, but it is the one that was more
or less
quite widely known
until about a century ago.
And that's the credit
creation theory of banking.
And this one says
banks are not financial intermediaries.
Banks are special.
They have a unique power
that no other player
in the economy has,
and that is the power to create money.
Okay.
So this critique,
I fundamentally really agree
with in the sense that I do
focus on this channel very much on bank
money creation in many, many videos.
And, he's right,
that many standard macroeconomic models
don't have banks that create money,
which seems like a giant oversight.
Right? That seems super important.
But the problem here is kind of similar
to what Michael
Saylor said here is that, like,
you can't model everything, right?
So you need to simplify somewhere.
And after in this
in these models, these DSD models,
they don't have banks that create money.
But now after a financial crisis,
there are also many DHC models
that do have bank money creation
and do have these things that Professor
Werner here is talking about.
So I think his critique, there's
definitely truth in it.
Bank money creation.
I've been promoting this super important
for the economy,
more important than most economists
I think, recognize.
But many economists do recognize this.
Central banks do recognize this, 
and they're more
and more models
that do actually include this.
And I think Professor Richard Werner,
I know I've read his books,
he's been criticizing this,
this type of criticism
for a long time, and I think by
now is a little bit outdated.
And there are a lot of models that have
this, but definitely read his books.
They're very interesting.
It is important. So yeah, absolutely.
But there's more there's more wrong
with macroeconomic models.
Let's see our friend Gary again, who
I think the next clip is from the models
which we study at universities nowadays.
One of the big simplifications
is that there is no inequality
in the model.
In fact, it's more than just that.
There is no inequality in the model.
There is only one person in the model.
So these models are what they call
representative agent models.
So rather than looking at 6
or 7 billion people in the world,
or like 66 million people in the UK,
or 300 million people in the US,
they say to make the model simpler,
we are just going to look at one
representative person.
So the average person
in the whole economy.
So all you care about is averages, right?
You're just taking one average person.
And of course if we change
the distribution, if I take some wealth
from you and give it to Bill gates,
or if I take some wealth
from Rishi Sunak and give it to you,
that changes the distribution.
But it doesn't change the average.
So basically, once you build this model,
which only looks
at the representative agent,
which is the average,
which is the aggregate, it's not only
that there is no inequality in the model.
There is not even any possibility
for inequality model.
These are models of averages. Theorem.
These are models of aggregates,
which is why
when modern economists
you've been to these elite universities
think about the economy,
they tend to think about them in terms of
averages or aggregate,
so that they're obsessed
with the big aggregate
measurements of the economy.
For example, GDP
is, of course, the classic one
unemployment,
inflation, central bank interest
rates, level of government
spending, level of government taxation.
These are things which you can measure
on an aggregate economy,
but they're nothing
to do with how is one person
affected versus another person.
So okay again
we see this critique standard simplified
models don't have a realistic feature
or a critical feature like inequality.
Again, the models that I previously made
did have this.
They were very complex.
They also had bank money creation.
But my model was really hard to study
precisely
because it had so many, so many features.
Therefore,
most economists make specialized variants
of the models that are in the standard.
For example, economists like Chicago
professor Greg Kaplan do study
inequality in these types of models
that Gary is talking about.
And they just do it by expanding it,
creating a variation.
And then they do model wealth inequality
between households.
So this critique is not entirely true.
And there's really actually a lot of
very well known economists
that even some of them won Nobel Prizes.
Angus Deaton, there's also Joseph
Stiglitz, Toni Atkinson.
Piketty is also very well known
that do study inequality.
So in fact, this literature has really
exploded over the past six years.
So I don't think this critique
is completely true.
But Gary's right
that a standard model does not have this.
So if you are just doing a bachelors
or a masters in economics like Gary did,
you will not encounter
these types of models
and then you won't learn about inequality
too much.
And that's a fair critique.
I think that is a problem.
So yeah, there's absolutely
some truth here, but I think what
we've seen now with these three clips
is that,
yeah, many models are wrong
and many don't have crucial features.
But the problem is also that
if you include all of these features,
then the model is too big.
You don't understand it anymore.
So this is just something
that economists and and scientists overall
I think have not figured out yet.
And if you are
going to study economics in university,
then yeah, you will not see many of this
super important features.
You will only see the simple models,
which gets us to the third
type of criticism, which I'm
going to react to today, which is that
economic education is bad.
Professor Steve Keen,
whom I actually met a couple of times,
I did a visit to the university
that he was at the time, King's
University of London during my BSD,
and I think Steve King
does some really good modeling,
and he made some really interesting
software for students called Minsky
that I absolutely encourage people
to tinker with if they want to understand
macroeconomics, but that does not mean
that I agree with Keen on Everything.
So let's see what he has to say.
What you learn is an obsolete technology.
Learning economics at a university
is like learning.
It's all like astronomy.
The centric equilibrium
epicycles being added to make your models
fit the data.
So it's not that economics
is not a discipline worth deeply studying,
it's that the university education around
that kind of so bad is bad.
Yeah, I'd say learn system dynamics,
do a course in system the dynamics
which you can apply in any field,
and then apply
what you learn out of system dynamics
to the issues of economics,
if that's what interests you.
Okay.
So here I disagree with Steve Keene. Yes.
An economics education is too often about
just doing some simple math
rather than studying economics.
But this can be explains.
You see, education is very conservative.
It takes time.
Research is actually quite a lot further.
We have banks
and we have inequality in research.
But for teachers to implement
all of this in their teaching program
is actually pretty difficult because
teachers are under a lot of pressure.
Typically in economics
they're not so well-paid,
and they have so many students
and so much grading to do.
And now, as a conclusion,
very often students don't see
all the best things that the economics
profession is working on right now.
But honestly, Keynes
models are not perfect either.
They don't have a lot
of realistic features
like actual humans in their modeled
and how they would behave.
So again,
I think the same problem comes back.
Economics is not perfect,
but it's also, as we discussed
at the start of this video,
because the system,
especially the macroeconomic system
that economists are trying to
study, is just so massive
and not fully explored yet.
And so, yeah,
because economists have a lot of work
to do and an economics
education is not perfect, but definitely
do study it in university
I did, and I loved it.
And you will too. You will learn a lot.
I think. Conclusion.
So yeah, that was my response
to these three types of critiques.
Critique.
Number one,
economics is not a hard or real science.
Yeah, it's not a hard science.
It is real science, I'd argue.
But it's a social science.
Social systems are more complex
than natural systems
because humans are more complex.
And on top of that, social scientists
may influence the system that they're in,
in validating their predictions.
And on top of that, just as with climate
science or studying planets, the bigger
a system gets, the less easy
it is to study them
through at least a gold standard
of science controlled experiments.
That being said,
economists are trying to do more
and more experiments are even featured.
A proper macroeconomic experiment
on this channel last year.
So I'm actually very excited
for the future of economics,
and you'll hear all about it
on this channel.
Even if critiques like economic models
aren't terribly outdated,
have some truth to them.
I somewhat agree with these.
Yes, most economic
models are very much oversimplified,
but as I have seen firsthand,
we don't have a perfect alternative yet.
Yes, I've made some super advanced
simulation models
that Michael Saylor would love,
but these had their own problems.
They were very difficult to track
what was going on with them.
Yeah.
And so I think there's a place
for many different types of models.
And there are.
And when Keynes says don't study
economics, it's a waste of time,
I really disagree.
Yes, you should be careful where you study
economics.
I recommend that you pick a department
that's known to be somewhat progressive,
scientifically speaking, where they teach
multiple schools of thought,
teach them economic history, and focus
on empirical economics, where really
all the action is these days alongside
these standard mathematical models.
And of course, on the side,
always watch this channel.
But yeah, that is my take. Do you agree?
