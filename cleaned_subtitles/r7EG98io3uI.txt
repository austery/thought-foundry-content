Philosophy is so refreshing, it makes you so happy
Each episode introduces you to a philosophical thinker
In the last video, we introduced Spinoza’s “Ethics”
In this video we introduce Spinoza’s political philosophy
That is, the book "Theological Politics"
Explore how people can break the constraints of society
get true freedom
The book "Tractatus Theologiae" was published in 1670
spinoza said
The purpose of this book is to defend freedom of thought
Human beings are born with the desire to freely seek knowledge
But this freedom is often violated
At that time Amsterdam was the most tolerant city in Europe
The founding constitution of the Netherlands stipulates
Everyone has religious freedom
No harassment in worshiping God
This founding promise says that you have the freedom to practice your religion
But you don’t have the freedom not to believe
Spinoza was persecuted for being an atheist
At that time, the Dutch government even stipulated
Civil servants must be Calvinists
The church is too powerful
hinders the freedom of philosophers to think
So Spinoza wrote this book
Trying to expose the facade of religious authority and government
I hope to invite intellectuals to break down superstitions
Leading society towards enlightenment
This book is so amazing because of its content
The publisher decided to publish under a pseudonym
The results shocked the whole of Europe as soon as they were published.
Criticized as a book of debauchery and a book from hell
The next year, it was ruled illegal by the High Court.
Among the intellectuals at that time
Only Leibniz wrote to Spinoza expressing his admiration
Most people accuse Spinoza of being an atheist
that his presence would endanger the Dutch Republic
This makes Spinoza a bit like Socrates
Socrates was also accused by the elite class
Said that his remarks would harm the city-state
He must be put to death
Then let's talk about it
How Spinoza’s Treatise on Theology and Politics Defends Philosophical Freedom
Spinoza's political philosophy
The fundamental purpose is to make people become a freer existence
Then we must ask what makes people unfree in society?
Who controls public opinion and monopolizes the right to interpret the truth?
Nowadays, it may be political parties and cyber armies.
But in 17th century Europe it was religious groups
Because there has always been a dispute between imperial power and religious power in European history.
The king will use the power of the church
Easier to rule the people
But the problem is
You give too much power to religious organizations
The people will listen to the church instead of the king
The result is that the church rules the state
Rather than the state ruling the church
The problem of religious involvement in politics still exists today
Some states in the United States officially require Darwin’s theory of evolution to be taught
Biblical creationism cannot be taught
Religious conservatives will come out to protest
Said this was an infringement on their religious freedom
<font color=#FFE400FF>The evolutionist tries to deny this.</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>The evolutionist tries to deny this.</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>He says, we don't come with baggage
.</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>But actually
the natural baggage they come with,</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>Not everyone has this
view,</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>But most of them tend to be atheism</font>
<font color=#FFE400FF>but the natural inclination is towards atheism.</font>
So when the two authorities, the imperial power and the religious power, fight, who has the final say?
The British philosopher Hobbes mentioned in his "Leviathan"
The king is in charge of the temporal government
The church governs the government of the next life
But there can only be one legitimate authority
It's the king
Otherwise people will be at a loss what to do
What about the clergy?
They are nothing more than "a coalition of liars who want to gain the power to rule mankind in this world."
Spinoza had a similar view
Religion uses emotions to control people's thoughts
The ultimate goal is to usurp state power
So criticizing religion is not just about opposing superstition
It’s about liberating people’s minds
Have more freedom to explore philosophical truths
So Spinoza will launch his criticism of religion
First use a set of psychology to explain the origin of religion
Human beings often encounter good luck and bad luck in life
The emergence of this kind of luck will challenge people's control
If a person has been very lucky in his life, he will not need to seek explanations
You may think that this is what you have worked hard for and what you deserve.
But if a person works hard, he will have bad luck
Then people will think about why I am so weak
Is there some external force interfering with my life?
People are afraid
Just imagine an external force that doesn't exist
Like evil spirits, gods, sins from past lives
Believe that behind bad things, there must be a subject doing it
Because when people assume that this external force exists,
You can further fantasize about it
I can control this external force in some way
So humans invented sacrificial rituals to appease the wrath of gods.
In this way, the master-slave relationship is reversed.
Originally my life was dominated by bad luck
Now I am the leader
I have the ability to change the environment and perform rituals
People regain the sense of control they lost in their lives
So religion actually originated from a set of "the psychology of mastery"
People want to regain their lost dominance through religion
This leads to an interesting conclusion
Does that mean that when things get better in life, people no longer need faith?
Marx and Nietzsche actually held this view
We don’t need to waste time criticizing religious beliefs
Because when people take back control of their lives
There is no need to hide in the comfort of religion anymore
but if so
Religious organizations will lose a large number of believers
So in order to maintain one's power
Religious organizations have invented various laws, rituals, and theology to control the masses
Only in this way can we ensure that people will continue to believe even if they do not encounter bottlenecks in their lives.
For example, ancient Rome had fixed festivals
Celebrations were held to entertain the gods
These religious festivals can serve an important political function
When the kings of the Roman Empire did something wrong and there were problems in society
People will not blame the rulers for not knowing how to govern the country
Instead, they will blame themselves for being negligent during religious ceremonies.
It must be that people are not pious enough to God
This has led to the country’s bad luck and bad luck.
Thus
Politicians can ally with religious groups
to consolidate power
People will not realize that the problem is not their own
Instead, they will want to contribute more to the country to maintain a sense of control.
So Spinoza’s political philosophy is fundamentally about dealing with this problem
Why people tenaciously defend the power that enslaves them
As if that was their salvation?
Then Spinoza further used psychology
Criticize the belief in "personal God" in many religions
Both Jewish and Christian gods have emotions just like humans.
Traditional Chinese gods are all equally human.
Some people even become gods
Thank you Master, Praise Master
Spinoza explains
Why do the gods in many religions look like humans?
The psychology behind this is
People feel that the most powerful person in society is the king
The king can give orders as he pleases
Wage war and invade other countries
A country dies
When the same earthquake or natural disaster occurs,
That power is like a king destroying a country
Doesn’t that mean there is a king-like subject behind the natural disaster?
So God must be a personal God like a king
For example, the Japanese Emperor Eternal Series has a similar concept.
Believe that kings are descendants of God
The psychology behind this creation
It is human beings who project their imaginary perfect state onto the outside.
So Spinoza said:
"If triangles could talk, he would say that God is a perfect triangle."
After criticizing the personality of God
Spinoza goes on to criticize "prophets" in religion
Because many religions have their origins in a group of ancient prophets
Moses was said to be able to communicate directly with God
Jesus is the incarnation of God
Muhammad received revelation from Archangel Gabriel
These prophets claimed to bring God's law into the world
Tell people how to pursue a good life
Because "divine revelation" is the knowledge given to mankind by God
That must be better than what philosophers can bring to mankind
Thus
Theology has a monopoly on what is truth and what is good
This is exactly what Spinoza was objecting to
So he wants to prove that the prophet has no way to monopolize the truth.
The wisdom of prophets does not lie in the fact that they speak the words of God
It's because they said what the people wanted to hear.
If there are people who are afraid
Because they understand crowd psychology very well
Know what the masses desire and fear
And be able to preach in a way that ordinary people can understand
For example, Moses told the Israelites
God is a blazing fire
in hebrew
Fire also means anger
It's about picturing an angry God.
Let the audience understand it at once
in other words
The prophet is better than the philosopher in that
The prophet is willing to yield to the understanding of his audience
But philosophers don’t care whether people understand or not.
Come again
Philosophy will lose to theology
It's because philosophers don't have as rich imagination as prophets
Spinoza thinks
Prophets are actually a group of people who are very good at thinking.
Imagination is too strong
Able to convert prophecies into images, visions, and dreams
Tell more vivid stories
This is more down-to-earth than the abstract arguments used by philosophers.
So people go to church and listen to the pastor preach
But few people go to universities to listen to lectures by philosophers
in other words
The founders of religious organizations are very smart
They know that the general public's level of knowledge is very low
So we need to inspire people's sense of morality
Instead of using philosophical arguments
It would be more effective to use fictional stories
Because even if a person listens to false stories and does good deeds
This person is still doing good deeds
<font color=#FFF200FF>When your time on earth has ended

<font color=#FFF200FF>we calculate the total value of your life

<font color=#FFF200FF>Only the people

<font color=#FFF200FF>Those at the top can come here, to the good place</font> <font color=#FFF200FF>
the true cream of the crop get to come here, to the good place.< /font>
But Spinoza was just against this
If you dare not do bad things
Is it because someone lied to you and told you that you will go to hell after death?
Then you are actually threatened by fear
Not because you really know what good and evil are
Emotions, not reason, determine your actions
You are a person who is being emotionally blackmailed
rather than real freedom
<font color=#FFF200FF>In fact, fear has been a recruiting tactic used by organized religion for centuries. </font> <font color=#FFF200FF> Actually, fear has been

<font color=#FFF200FF>When you add guilt to keep people in line

<font color=#FFF200FF>It's
an extremely efficient form of crowd control.</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>Sheldon Our religion is based on love, Sheldon, not fear.</font> <font color=#FFF200FF>Our religion is based on love,

<font color=#FFF200FF>What will happen to those who do not follow the rules? </font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>What happens when people don't follow the rules?</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>They will burn in Hell .</font> <font color=#FFF200FF>They burn in Hell
.</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>Because God loves 'em.</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>Because God loves 'em.</font>
Spinoza thinks
On the contrary, this hinders the development of human reason
You have no knowledge of good and evil
But just instinctively led by emotions
Just like adults lie to children and say that if you do bad things, the police will arrest you.
in fact
We can tell people with rational arguments
Why it is good to do good
Why should you "love your neighbor"?
Not because God has the final say
Rather, arguments should be made
Make people obey reason and act
This is what Spinoza calls "true religion"
But Jewish law says exactly the opposite
If people are rational
Instead of doing good deeds because of faith
Then you won’t get God’s blessing
So Spinoza praised Paul in the New Testament even more
Because when Paul was preaching
The words have the structure of rational argument
Rather than just referring to God's authority like Moses
Say what you should do
After criticizing the prophet
Spinoza goes on to criticize the idea of ​​the supernatural
Supernatural is beyond the scope of what natural science can explain
like a miracle, a miracle
Supernatural phenomena are actually an important metaphysical issue in the West
Because natural science emphasizes that if there is an effect, there must be a cause
All phenomena can be traced back to a certain cause
But if supernatural phenomena exist
It means that there is some external force that can interfere with the operation of nature.
So many philosophers have to provide explanations for supernatural phenomena
Like Leibniz thought
Paranormal phenomena exist
Just if God needs to continue to intervene in the human world to perform miracles
It means the world is imperfect
Requires constant maintenance
Then God should never have created such a world in the first place
So if there really is a miracle
It should be God at the beginning of creation
Just plan in advance what will happen in the future
The miracle that will happen in the future is implanted from the beginning
But once miracles are allowed to exist
The causal sequence in nature will be disrupted
Newtonian mechanics tells us
Gravity causes objects to fall
But if there is a miracle, Newtonian mechanics can be violated
Like when Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt
God parted the Red Sea
So should people believe the Bible or Newtonian mechanics?
spinoza said
all paranormal phenomena
There must be some natural reason
It’s just that the knowledge level of the parties involved is insufficient
It's just unexplainable
Because nature is an entity
All things are determined by the laws of nature
So there is no chance in the universe
People who believe in miracles and supernatural phenomena
Doesn't mean he's religious
It means he is ignorant
Inability to understand the cause-and-effect sequence in nature
For example, the Bible says that after the great flood receded,
God placed the rainbow in front of Noah
But Spinoza himself was an expert in optics
He said it was just the refraction of sunlight through water vapor
It’s just that people in ancient times didn’t understand
Mistaking it for God’s power
Or the story of Maria’s virgin pregnancy.
American philosopher Sam Harris believes that
This is a wrong translation of Hebrew
Mistranslated young woman (Almah) into virgin
So all kinds of supernatural phenomena
In fact, reasonable causal explanations can be obtained
But the ruling class happens to like the ignorance of the masses
So they can tell stories of miracles and supernatural phenomena to control believers
Because for the general public
The easiest way to prove the existence of God
That is to say, miracles will intervene in the operations of the human world.
But Spinoza thinks instead
Belief in the supernatural is actually blasphemy against God
Because the physical laws of nature were originally created by God
Why did God do another thing to violate the laws of His creation?
Isn’t this a very contradictory God?
The existence of miracles actually proves the limitations of God
Because he actually created an imperfect world
You still need to constantly maintain it yourself
This reflects the incompetence and irrationality of the Creator
Spinoza's Critique of the Supernatural
laid the foundation for the rise of Western natural science
If an earthquake occurs naturally
You have to look for an explanation within nature
Cannot appeal to a supernatural explanation
After criticizing religion
Now Spinoza comes to talk about law and the origin of the state
Because this is also related to religion
Moses encountered a problem after leading the Israelites out of Egypt
Originally, the Israelites in Egypt were slaves
It’s clear what regulations need to be followed
But after liberation
There was no law to guide the lives of the Israelites
They actually became a group of stateless people.
There is no national identity
To unify the people of Israel into one nation
Moses created the law from scratch
Decide what to wear and what to eat to be an Israeli
To distinguish them from other ethnic groups
Then Moses discovered
If members keep the law not out of fear
But because of loyalty
Then this community will be stronger
So Moses told the people
He did not make these laws
But God told him
Because the Israelites are God’s chosen people
Some sects of Judaism even believe
The Jewish souls are different from those of other nations
This makes even the most ordinary daily actions of the Israelis full of religious character
As if everything I do is affirming God's law
Jewish law also has the concept that "Jews are the chosen people"
In fact, it is a rhetoric invented by leaders
bring people together
It is a means of survival in critical moments
in other words
The existence of the law is not actually for personal religious salvation.
but for the well-being of the country’s community
This leads Spinoza to an important conclusion
Since Jewish law is for the national interest of the Jewish people
Then Jewish law will be unnecessary after the end of the Hebrew Kingdom
Because the Jews no longer have a country
So after the Jews were exiled to various places,
What should be obeyed are the laws of each country
not the law of Moses
This is why Spinoza was expelled from the Jewish community of his day
He believed that the Jews thought they were God's chosen people
This sense of national superiority will tear apart their relationship with other groups.
in the 17th century
Europe fought religious wars for 30 years
Philosophers at that time were thinking about a question: How is social order possible?
The state and the church claim to bring peace and happiness
Why did it bring war and casualties instead?
Therefore, the philosophers at that time all hoped to re-find the foundation of a social order.
For example, Hobbes said, we can imagine
How will humans get along with each other in a state of anarchy?
Hobbes thinks
Everyone will pursue their own interests and expand their power
Because at this time there is no government to decide what is legal right and wrong
So if you use violence to compete for resources, it’s not illegal.
The result is that the strong will dominate others
But the weak can also unite to dominate the strong
become stronger than him
in natural state
Everyone is afraid of each other and makes war with each other
Then this nation may soon be extinct.
On the contrary, unable to protect oneself
So a rational person would find
Peace is better for everyone
There must be a neutral arbitration
to end this anarchy
So the parties to the truce signed a contract
Authorize a supreme authority that can enforce the law
to maintain peace
This is the origin of the country
Spinoza partially agrees with this statement
Yes, human nature is all about self-preservation.
But Hobbes favored monarchy
That is, sovereignty belongs to a single individual, a king.
Spinoza thinks
Monarchy is an invasion of liberty
Because rulers may not necessarily consider the interests of the people
Democracy can realize the common interests of the country
Because in democratic meetings
It is unlikely that most people will allow stupid things to happen at the same time
Democracy can allow irrational individuals to exist
As long as we don't become the majority, it'll be fine
Because rational people can still block unreasonable legal proposals
If the law is approved with the consent of the people
That people obey the law
In fact, it means obeying your own will
This idea was important to Spinoza
Being a law-abiding citizen is not because I am a slave to the law
But because I think the law is reasonable
affirmed by my will
So if the country passes an unreasonable bill
Or even become a dictatorship?
At this time people become slaves of the law
Then the people have the right to resist
Take back the powers originally given to the state
Spinoza thinks
The purpose of the state is to allow citizens to grow freely
Freedom here means the ability to use reason without restrictions
Not bound by emotions and fears
For example, those who break the law will be punished by the state
But if citizens can understand why the law stipulates this
What is the rationale behind
Citizens don’t do bad things out of fear
But choosing not to do bad things out of rationality
And thus became a freer person
To allow citizens to grow freely
The state should also protect citizens’ freedom of speech
Spinoza's friend Kolbage
Imprisoned for speaking out against the church
Finally died in prison
This incident had a great impact on him
Spinoza’s argument in defense of free speech has three levels
first
If one day the law prohibits certain things from being said,
Citizens will continue to express what they believe
Just change it to express it privately
Just don’t let others know
It's like many countries ban marijuana
This won't make pot smokers want to die
Just become a private purchase of marijuana
So Spinoza said:
"What cannot be forbidden must be allowed, even if it involves harm."
So this is actually the attitude towards cannabis in the Netherlands today.
Next, on the emotional level
Suppressing free speech creates a sense of resentment among the masses
people will hate each other
Society will be disunified
Finally, at the level of efficiency
Free speech contributes to the growth of human knowledge and creativity
For example, the Netherlands in the 17th century had a highly developed economy, art, and culture.
In comparison
Look at China today
Many literary and artistic creations are subject to official censorship
Many Hollywood movies cannot be released in China
Society as a whole cannot unleash cultural creativity.
But Spinoza had a bottom line for freedom of speech
If it's inflammatory rhetoric that could overthrow the country
Then the government should review
Other discriminatory and hurtful jokes should be tolerated
In today’s episode of the video we introduce Spinoza’s “Tractatus Theologico-Political”
To defend the freedom of philosophy from infringement
Spinoza proposed a psychology of the origins of religion
Rule out the possibility of miracles
Exposing the prophet's revelatory power
Finally denying the validity of religious laws
Defend the freedom of speech guaranteed by the state
This led to Spinoza being hailed as the father of modernity
Pioneer of the Enlightenment
Revolutionary movements in Britain, France, and the United States were all inspired by this book
Establishing a secular government after the revolution
free from interference from religious forces
If "Ethics" is to liberate people as individuals,
The "Theological and Political Treatise" is to liberate people as citizens
To criticize the forces in society that pretend to be salvation on the surface
In fact, it brings slavery
And to get true freedom
The psychological mechanisms behind these enslavements must be exposed
Let the public know how they are emotionally manipulated
trapped in lack of freedom
We can also think about it
What voices are masquerading as salvation in today’s society?
In fact, it brings slavery
And why do people tenaciously defend the power that enslaves them?
As if that was their salvation?
