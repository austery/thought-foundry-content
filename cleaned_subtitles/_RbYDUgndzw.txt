In the previous video, we introduced the first half of the book "The Dawn of Everything".
Breaking down various historical myths
The Enlightenment and the Origins of Inequality
Theories of technological progress, economic determinism, and the agricultural revolution
But even if these myths are shattered
Some people will still say
The egalitarian experiments you mentioned
These can only be sustained in small-scale hunter-gatherer communities.
It becomes difficult to maintain equality as long as the population expands.
Or some might say
Even with these examples
We still cannot deny that humanity has ultimately adopted the state system and capitalism.
Some people would say
Even if indigenous societies can maintain equality and freedom
But their technological level is very low.
I'd rather live in a big city and enjoy a technologically advanced lifestyle.
It's okay to sacrifice a little freedom
These objections sound quite reasonable.
However, this has actually been refuted by the latest archaeological evidence.
In this episode, we'll debunk these myths one by one.
Revealing the true history of humankind
Many books on big history
Like Jared Diamond's *Guns, Germs, and Steel*
A set of arguments is popular
Hunting-gatherer societies can maintain freedom and equality
Precisely because of its small scale
As long as the population grows to a certain number
It would be difficult to maintain an equal and democratic community.
Therefore, population size is the key to the origin of inequality.
This claim even has a basis in evolutionary psychology.
Evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar pointed out
The human brain
My cognitive ability can only remember the names of 150 people.
Because of the long-term
Human ancestors all lived in small-scale societies.
There is absolutely no need to remember more than 150 people.
Moreover, these 150 people are usually related by blood.
Therefore, hunter-gatherer societies can maintain equality.
Because they are all close friends or family members.
As long as the population expands to include foreigners and strangers
You won't want to be equal with others anymore.
Therefore, Dunbar's conclusion is...
Once the scale of society expands
There must be a ruler directing from above.
There also needs to be a national police force to ensure everyone obeys the law.
Now we're going to debunk this common myth about population size.
The latest anthropological research findings
Many hunter-gatherer societies
It's not living in a small society at all.
For example, the Martu people of Australia.
They would say they share a common totem ancestor.
This led anthropologists to believe they were related.
However, upon closer examination, it was discovered that...
People related by blood make up less than 10% of the population.
Most of the members are actually from other places.
It turns out that what they called a totem was just a metaphor.
Just like when we move to Taipei, we call ourselves Taipei residents.
hunter-gatherer society
If you are disappointed in your family
They can fly far away to other tribes
Join other totem organizations
The community also welcomes new members.
Over time, they will come to regard you as family.
Treat them like brothers and sisters
This is why anthropologists come to the tribe
They would assume they were all one family.
This actually reflects the highly mobile and open nature of hunter-gatherer societies.
Scholars used to think they were small-scale societies.
But now we know
They are actually large-scale networks
They will continuously exchange members.
In comparison
We who live in cities today
Actually, it's more closed off.
Because even if you live in a big city
In reality, your social circle probably doesn't exceed 150 people.
You are still living a social digital life like your hunter-gatherer ancestors.
But they imagine themselves living in a large-scale society.
So the issue of population size
It's just imagination.
Just like the existence of nation-states
It is actually a fictional creation invented by humans.
Allowing people to imagine themselves as members of a large-scale community
Another myth is that...
Cities will emerge as long as the population size increases.
It's difficult to maintain equality as long as there are cities.
Because cities are too complex
There is a division of labor in society
This will naturally lead to class differentiation.
So now the author is going to debunk the myth that "cities bring inequality".
Latest archaeological evidence reveals
There is a city in Ukraine called Trypillia, dating back to 4000 BC.
This city has existed for 800 years
Population estimated at 20,000 to 40,000
Amazing
Archaeologists have found no evidence of class division or bureaucratic rule.
No central administrative body
There are no defensive buildings.
Only after discovering thousands of family buildings
Like the rings of a tree, forming a circle
A large area of ​​land was left vacant in the middle.
The food diversity in this city is amazing.
Citizens will plant their own orchards
They engaged in farming, animal husbandry, and hunting.
Unlike today's industrial cities
They all transported food from rural areas to the city.
Maintaining such a diverse economic structure for 800 years is no easy feat.
It's impossible to say they lived in a primitive society.
They should be called urban civilization.
However, an abundant food supply usually leads to surplus.
This will lead to some people wanting to seize the remaining [items].
That inequality is bound to occur.
However, there was no sign of war or elite rule during these 800 years.
Archaeologists can even determine the degree of social inequality by examining items found in dwellings.
The Gini coefficient is used to quantify social inequality.
The result was that over several generations...
Even as urban development becomes increasingly complex
Their society did not become more unequal as a result.
This leads scholars to a conclusion
Even in large-scale, complex cities
Mechanisms can also be found to mitigate inequality.
You might say this is just a single case
This shouldn't be taken as a general theory.
But now the author wants to further argue...
In fact, many cities in early human history had methods to maintain equality.
First, the earliest city-states of Sumerian civilization
There was absolutely no trace of imperial power.
Mesopotamian mythology records
Human beings were created
It's because God doesn't want to work.
So in the end, they created humans.
Although urban dwellers usually have different professions
However, when providing public construction services for the city
Like royalty and nobility, they also had to dedicate themselves and work for the gods.
It can be said that everyone is equal before God.
The ancient Hymns of Gudea, dating back to 3,000 BC, recorded:
Generals, colonels, captains, and soldiers—"everyone shares the work equally."
Early Sumerian city-states also had citizen assemblies.
However, unlike the city-states of ancient Greece...
They will not exclude women and laborers.
If there are records, then say
Potters and employees can participate in jury meetings.
Danish historian Thorkild Jacobsen called this the "primitive democracy" of the ancient Sumerian city-states.
The spontaneous forces of the Sumerian city-state
There are even ways to stop foreign invaders.
For example, 1900 BC
The Amorites conquered most of the Euphrates River region.
Mari, one of the democratic cities at the time
Long before the conquerors arrived
A large number of local people fled.
Daniel Fleming, an expert in Assyriology, even discovered...
From the correspondence at that time
It records many methods used by the common people to check and balance the rulers.
For example, a minister named Terru wrote a letter to the king complaining that:
"Because I obeyed the king's orders, the city's inhabitants despised me and wanted to drive me away... In the end, I had no choice but to hide in other cities."
Early Sumerian city-states used pressure in this way.
To eliminate those who want to create inequality
Drive those who succumb to inequality out of the city-state
Or if there is a foreign ruler
Want to conquer the whole city
They would directly abandon their original city-states.
immigrating to other places
But then an interesting twist occurred.
It is precisely because of the residents who believe in equality
They escaped to areas outside the city.
Instead, it allowed the city to be dominated by those who craved power.
Inequality began to emerge.
We can even speculate further.
The existence of these equal cities
In fact, it intensified the monarch's desire for conquest.
The Origin of Royal Power
Actually, it was to oppose egalitarian cities.
This is what we discussed in the previous episode as the "splitting origins".
Let's turn our attention to India's earliest city-states.
Mohenjo-daro, an ancient city dating back to 2600 BC
This city has stood for 700 years
It has a very advanced drainage system and sewage management system.
But one cannot see the royal palace, the ruling class, or the elite authorities.
We also do not see the concentration of wealth.
There were no noble tombs.
Even weapons are rare.
Amazing
Every family here seems to possess considerable material wealth.
But to have such a developed urban civilization
How could there be no central command?
Or will it lead to wealth inequality?
Therefore, many netizens simply said
This must have been built by aliens.
But actually, we don't need to use aliens to explain it.
One possible explanation is
Mohenjo-daro was built through a collective decision by the city's citizens.
This city is where humanity can develop a highly civilized society.
Evidence that maintains equality
Finally, let's look at the evidence from Chinese history.
In recent years, archaeologists have discovered the Taosi site, which dates back 4,000 years.
It is considered the capital of the Yao Dynasty, the first dynasty in Chinese history.
This city has the oldest observatory in East Asia.
4700 years ago
There is also a clear gap between the rich and the poor in cities.
Residential areas are divided into working-class areas and elite areas.
But archaeologists discovered
In the later stages of the city's development
The entire city has undergone tremendous changes.
The palaces and temples of princes and nobles were all destroyed.
The original distinction between commoners and elites was also eliminated.
Instead, it was transformed into a large settlement.
This leads archaeologists to speculate
The first urban riot in human history may have occurred here.
The people rose up and overthrew the ruling class
This city remained intact for 200 years after the revolution.
From the above examples, we can see that...
Ukraine, India, Mesopotamia, China
The earliest cities in these places
There is evidence of egalitarianism.
This overturns the myth of population size that we often hear.
It did not develop into urban civilization.
Inequality will naturally arise.
In fact, the first cities to appear in human history
There are various ways to maintain equality.
After breaking the myth that population size and urban areas lead to inequality
Some people might say
So what if early cities in human history were relatively egalitarian?
Ultimately, the city still succumbed to inequality.
So now the author wants to turn the tables.
Even if a city becomes unequal
The people still have a chance to transform it into equality.
The most convincing real-world examples
Teotihuacan, a major city in Mexico
The city was built around 100 BC.
It flourished until 600 AD before declining.
Conservative estimates put the city's population at at least 100,000.
It was one of the largest cities on Earth at the time.
This city was originally under autocratic rule
There is even archaeological evidence of murder and sacrifice.
But the amazing thing is...
Around 300 AD
A sudden major reversal occurred.
The local temple of the feathered serpent god was set on fire.
After this incident
Suddenly, no trace of a ruling class could be found in society.
There were no large tombs or royal families.
The ritual of killing and sacrificing people also disappeared.
Therefore, archaeologists believe
This was likely due to the collective awakening of the citizens at that time.
The decision to overthrow the autocratic ruler
Even more amazing is
Around 300 AD
Large-scale stone apartment buildings began to appear.
These apartments are luxurious
Archaeologists initially thought it was a royal palace.
However, as more and more archaeological evidence emerged...
Only then did I realize that this couldn't possibly be a palace.
Because the entire city has 100,000 people.
More than 90% of the population lives in these apartments.
René Millon, an archaeological authority specializing in Teotihuacan, believes that
This is actually because cities are becoming increasingly crowded as the population increases.
So people came up with new urban planning ideas.
The hope is that all citizens can have a place to live.
Therefore, these apartment complexes should be understood as social housing.
Perhaps no city in human history can compare to Teotihuacan.
To enable almost all residents to enjoy a high standard of living
There were no shell-less snails or homeless people in the entire city.
Not only that
Archaeologists also discovered
The city has a very diverse ethnic composition.
People from all over Central America can be seen.
It is a city that is very open to immigrants.
Please note!
Teotihuacan is not a small-scale society.
This is a metropolis of 100,000 people.
This shatters the myth that cities bring inequality.
But why would the people of Teotihuacan decide to build an equal city?
Art historian Esther Pasztory discovered
The city of Teotihuacan has a very special place
It contains no artwork depicting monarchs.
Compared to the Mayan kingdom of the same period
Their artwork
It often consists of praise for the rulers, war, and bloody scenes.
But Teotihuacan's art actually depicts scenes of a group of people having a party.
This difference is likely not accidental.
Because both Teotihuacan and the Mayan city were aware of each other's existence.
Moreover, both sides have trade relations.
Therefore, it is very likely that Teotihuacan artists deliberately created art that differed from Mayan art.
They deliberately showed that they were different from their neighboring Mayan society.
I will not idolize any authoritarian figure
Instead, it promotes the values ​​of community integration.
Pasztory calls this "cultural inversion".
It's a society deliberately going against the grain culturally.
This is to express that our society is different from yours.
Just like the "split origin" we talked about in the previous video.
After breaking the myth of urban origins
Next, the author will break the myth of the origin of the nation.
At the end of the 19th century, German philosopher Rudolf Von Ihering defined the state as:
They monopolized the power to legally use coercive force within a certain territory.
Because the state needs to be able to enforce the law.
Only in order to maintain social order
This definition was later adopted by sociologist Weber.
It has become the mainstream definition of the state in contemporary social science.
However, if we look back at human history
We will find that this definition actually only applies to modern states.
This was not the case in many early states.
The author believes we need to consider the emergence of the state.
It is possible to distinguish the three sources of social power.
Violent control, knowledge-based control, and charismatic control
Violent control is the definition of the modern state.
A sovereign monopolizes the power to legally use violence.
Knowledge-based control means that those who possess knowledge possess power.
For example, the medieval church possessed knowledge about going to heaven.
Or perhaps the indigenous society had shamans who possessed religious and traditional knowledge.
Finally, there's charismatic control.
Let's think about what happens in friendship.
Logically speaking, there should be no class distinction.
But we all know
There are always some charismatic people in your social circle who consistently take the lead.
Over time, his friends will be more likely to listen to him.
It's like gaining control of the discourse without even realizing it.
Therefore, even within friendships, power dynamics are often present.
Violent control, knowledge-based control, and charismatic control
This corresponds perfectly to the ruling power, bureaucracy, and electoral competition of democratic leaders in modern states.
Now the author needs to argue...
In fact, no country has a unified origin.
Because these three forms of power control each have different origins.
Many early regimes actually only used one type of power to control...
It cannot be called a country.
The author refers to this as a "first-order regime".
For example, the Shiluk people of South Sudan.
Their monarchs, although able to issue commands
However, the scope only involves people in the surrounding area.
The king lived in the isolated capital and held ceremonies regularly.
But in their view
The king is a sacred being.
Therefore, ordinary people cannot easily approach.
If the king goes on a tour, the people should hide in awe.
This led to an interesting result.
Although the king held power
But he finds it difficult to actually exercise power over others.
Because people will avoid him.
in other words
People limit the power of rulers by obeying rituals and rules.
This is somewhat similar to public institutions in modern states.
There are red tape
Various legal provisions are a hindrance
However, civil servants also have no choice but to obey.
The author cites an extreme case.
Anthropologist James George Frazer discovered that ancient Rome had a system of "ritual executions."
Lake Nemi in ancient Rome, Italy.
There was a priest known as Rex Nemorensis, the King of Lake Nemorensis.
Only runaway slaves can challenge for this priesthood.
Moreover, to obtain this official position
The former priest must be killed first.
This means
You yourself will be the last one
He will also be killed by the next challenger.
Frazer discovered in the myths of peoples around the world
Similar stories can be found everywhere.
When mortals seize power
It's like becoming a god.
Eventually they will be killed.
Frazer's explanation is
This is because early humans believed
The god-king must be replaced before he declines.
Only in order to maintain the cycle of life force
The author uses this theory
This is used to explain why early city-states did not develop into nations.
Because when the ruler holds too much power
In the eyes of the people
He had already become less than human.
Rather, they are like gods.
Therefore, he must die.
This periodic ritual
This prevents any one person from having too much power.
How then do we explain the emergence of the state?
The author argues that early states were all "second-order regimes".
That is, it satisfies two of the three types of power control.
For example, the Mayan kingdom had both charismatic and violent forms of rule.
However, it lacks an administrative bureaucracy.
The Maya were not interested in recording household registrations or the birth dates of ordinary people.
They were more interested in recording celestial phenomena and the birth dates of deities.
That is, their bureaucratic system appeared in heaven.
The Shang Dynasty in China also lacked a clear administrative bureaucracy.
However, there is a combination of charismatic appeal and violent dominance.
The kings of the Shang Dynasty consulted oracle bone inscriptions for all matters, big and small.
It seems that the souls of ancestors are the only political authority.
It can be said that their rule belongs to the realm of gods.
Then there's the ancient Egyptian kingdom, which had all three types of power control.
Therefore, ancient Egypt is key to understanding the origins of states.
Archaeologists have discovered that the formation of states is related to the emergence of large-scale burials.
Wherever large-scale burials occur in various parts of the world
A new kingdom will emerge after a few generations.
For example, the Shang Dynasty in China
When a ruler dies, someone is always buried with him.
Moreover, they used enemy prisoners of war as funerary sacrifices.
They would also deliberately destroy their remains.
This tactic might be intended to prevent the enemy from providing for their deceased relatives.
In other words, don't let someone else become your ancestor.
This way, their descendants will be unable to perform ancestral rites.
And could only be used to support the emperor.
But the situation in Egypt is the opposite.
The king's confidants after his death
Family members, military officers, and government officials were all buried alive with him.
Why did early kings engage in large-scale funerary sacrifices?
Moreover, once power is consolidated...
This custom disappeared.
The author speculates
This may stem from a series of reflections by the living regarding their responsibility to the deceased.
The ancient Egyptians believed in an afterlife and a world beyond death.
Therefore, they need to think.
Do deceased kings still need servants in the afterlife?
This explains why
Those buried with the king were all people who had devoted their lives to caring for him.
That is, to ensure that the king will still be king in the next life.
There are still people taking care of her.
From a national perspective
It is actually indicating that the kingdom has a system of power over these people.
Like the workers who built the Giza pyramids
They are actually well protected by the state.
The country will treat them like good friends of the royal family.
These workers do not feel that they are being exploited.
On the contrary, they would feel honored to be able to take care of their beloved king.
Build a pyramid for him
The Origin of the State
It is very likely this kind of violent structure "under the guise of care"
Absorb the social momentum that originally came from a social group caring for an individual.
Shift towards taking care of the operation of the state apparatus
The people's loyalty to a certain ruler
Transformed into loyalty to the country
Therefore, the pyramids served a social function.
Used to commemorate these kings
In this way
After a king died
The state apparatus can still function smoothly.
in other words
Violent rule actually takes advantage of the early people's spirit of caring for others.
Again
How did the bureaucratic system first emerge?
Previous theories all believed that
Because people need to cooperate in managing agricultural irrigation.
Someone needs to give orders.
With the expansion of population size
Cities need bureaucrats to manage information.
However, the latest archaeological evidence has found...
The earliest bureaucratic systems actually appeared in small communities.
8000 years ago
A site in Syria (Tell Sabi Abyad) was discovered
Long before the advent of writing
People would use geometric symbols to record the stored goods in the granary.
Archaeologists believe this was likely used for financial management.
The buildings in this area are all about the same size.
The distribution of assets among everyone is also consistent.
There is no indication of inequality.
So these administrative records
It is very likely a tool used for equitable distribution.
Accurately record the wealth level of each family.
Make sure no family is richer than the others.
The earliest appearance of administrative tools
It is not a tool for the state to exploit the people.
On the contrary
It originates from the concept of equality.
To prevent unfair exploitation
A similar system exists in the Ayllu organization in Peru, South America.
Locals use knotted ropes to record events.
Record the labor force and land area of ​​each household.
Which family has a labor shortage?
Other families can then go and help.
When other families need help next time
You can then give back.
Administrative tools were originally used to ensure the fairness of distribution.
However, after the emergence of the state
However, they misappropriated these tools for their own use.
Like after the emergence of the Inca Empire
Let's take Ayllu's knotted rope method of record-keeping as an example.
Used to record how much labor service debt the people owe to the central government.
Or it is also recorded in the prophetic books of the Bible.
The Persian King's Tax Demands
This has plunged many farmers into debt.
They were forced to sell their sheep and vineyards.
In the end, they were forced to sell their own children into slavery.
Ultimately, this sparked public resentment.
Therefore, it wasn't after the emergence of the administrative system that...
This naturally led to the development of national inequality.
On the contrary
The administrative system was initially created to maintain equality.
However, the state took this entire system away.
Transformed into a pressing tool
Record how much debt the people owe
egalitarian administration
There is a key difference between this and administrative misappropriation by the state.
Pursuing an equal society through administrative tools
It is to provide people with a standard
We can discuss how to make it fair.
This also leaves room for negotiation.
However, when the state misappropriates this tool...
Written records become bureaucratic.
Officials will tell the people
Because you owe this much money.
Acting in accordance with the law means that punishment is mandatory.
So we see a flipping process.
Administrative tools were originally designed to create a force for mutual assistance among civilizations.
However, once the state took control, it became a force that oppressed the people.
But people mistakenly believe
These technological innovations are a testament to the nation's efforts.
Equating the state directly with civilization
In summary, we will find
There is no single, unified origin for nations.
Different regions actually have different origins.
Various ideas emerged that aimed to limit royal power, care for others, and pursue equality.
After dispelling various myths
Finally, let's return to the starting point.
Let me explain what was mentioned in the previous video.
Why do Native Americans criticize European societies for being unfree and unequal?
This is not because their culture inherently values ​​freedom and equality.
Rather, there is a forgotten story behind it.
In 1050 AD
There was once a city along the Mississippi River called Cahokia, which was then the largest city in North America.
The city is estimated to have at least 15,000 people.
Possibly the earliest prototype of a nation in North America
This city is famous
Indigenous peoples from all over North America settled here.
This led to an explosive growth in the city's population to 40,000.
Beginning in 1150
Walls began to appear in the city.
This suggests a possible need to defend against external enemies.
Then came signs of war and population outflow.
By the 15th century
The entire area has become a wasteland.
Archaeologists are still arguing
What exactly caused this city to collapse?
It could be war, or it could be ecological collapse.
But the more interesting question is...
Where did all the people who used to live in this city go?
They may have all moved to the far reaches of the city.
Or perhaps they returned to their native land.
Because this city already has a large immigrant population.
For example, in the mythology of the Cherokee tribe
It records a large-scale rebellion
Rumors circulated three hundred years before Europeans arrived in the Americas
The male priest Ani-kutani became excessively corrupt.
Even assaulting women in the clan
Cherokee people can't stand it
Finally, the ruling class was overthrown.
This myth records
It might refer to the process of the overthrow of the city of Cahokia.
People leaving the city
They are likely deliberately trying to avoid the recurrence of political inequality in their society.
Therefore, the Native Americans we see today are not primitive savages at all.
Rather, it once possessed a highly advanced civilization.
But later he decided to leave the city.
This active rejection is a spontaneous social movement.
Just like Hong Kong people feel that the social system is too corrupt.
Therefore, the decision to pursue mass migration is the same.
People in early American cities
Having witnessed the increasing inequality in the city, I decided to leave.
To build a more equitable community in other regions
This may be why
The five major Native American tribes all have similar political systems.
There is a public council
Everyone has an equal right to speak
Decide things through consensus
The Creek tribe even has a system for making political discussions more rational.
It means smoking tobacco.
Smoking can soothe emotions.
So when European missionaries saw Native Americans holding a meeting...
He always has a cigarette in his mouth.
It was during this period
Tobacco spread from the Americas to Europe
Smoking is becoming popular in Europe
In the salon banquets held during the Enlightenment
You'll see European philosophers starting to smoke cigarettes too.
Smoking while discussing philosophical issues
This tradition actually originated from Native Americans.
In the myths of the Osages
We have also seen similar stories of pursuing political equality.
There was originally a group of chieftain wizards who misused knowledge
Later, a new alliance system emerged and replaced them.
To pass on the knowledge originally held by wizards to everyone
Knowledge is no longer monopolized by a few.
This allows political power to be decentralized and balanced.
In Montesquieu's *The Spirit of the Laws*
It recorded the political organization of the Osage people.
This makes people not only suspicious
Montesquieu's proposed democracy, separation of powers, and checks and balances
Is it possible that this inspiration was drawn from indigenous societies?
From this entire background story
This explains why it was mentioned in the previous episode.
Kondiaronk will uphold the spirit of rational debate.
It's not because Native Americans are inherently inclined towards freedom and equality.
Rather, it was because their ancestors had witnessed the inequalities that developed in urban civilization, such as Cahokia.
These historical stories remain in the collective memory of Native Americans.
Therefore, each tribe developed its own unique mythology, culture, and political system.
To avoid repeating the same mistakes
It is precisely because they have learned from the lessons of history
Ultimately, this inspired European philosophers to reflect on the meaning of freedom and equality.
Now let's summarize the human story in "All Revealed".
The 18th-century Enlightenment movement explored the philosophies of freedom and equality.
Actually, it was because materials criticizing European society by indigenous people were transmitted back to Europe.
This led Europeans to become aware of the problem of inequality.
This eventually led to the French Revolution.
However, European society benefited from the ideas of indigenous peoples.
In order to justify the inequalities brought about by capitalism
Conservative Enlightenment philosophers began to claim
Indigenous societies are small in scale and less civilized.
Only then can freedom and equality be maintained.
If it develops into a complex society
The emergence of the state, capitalism, and inequality will inevitably arise.
Use this rhetoric to make the workers in industrial cities accept their fate.
However, the latest archaeological evidence has proven that these claims are merely myths.
It is not true that the more advanced a civilization is.
This will inevitably lead to more inequality and lack of freedom.
This is actually a result of people losing their imagination.
This new history of humankind is meant to tell us...
Over the past few thousand years
Humans are all trying to use their creativity to achieve freedom.
People change their social relationships seasonally.
To avoid the emergence of inequality
People are not confined to small tribes.
Instead, it can build a community network spanning the continent.
People have built metropolises with populations exceeding 100,000.
Large-scale social housing that takes care of every citizen
People have also invented administrative accounting systems that uphold the ideal of equality.
People will also actively resist the inequalities that emerge in cities.
Launching social movements and overthrowing the ruling class
Human history has developed to this point
Every era has seen various possibilities for freedom.
As long as we break the myth of the evolution of civilization
It is possible to regain the freedom that humanity has ever achieved.
Creating a brand new human history
