All right. Hello everybody. Welcome back to the channel. This is the official introduction to my new manager stream. We got a lot to talk about, a lot of updates for 2026. Ladies and gentlemen, this is Jessica.
>> Nice to meet you.
>> So, this is her first stream ever. So, how does
>> Bear with me?
>> How does it feel just like being
>> I don't know. I'm I'm ready to get absolutely cooked. [laughter] [gasps]
>> She The good thing about Jess is that she has an absolute 16-year-old sense of humor. And yes, as Doug says, the manager still can't get Emit to be on time. No. [laughter]
>> So,
>> we're working on it.
>> We're working on it. But exciting stuff. We got a lot to talk about. Uh, we've been developing this AK Media brand for four years now. And, uh, I think going into 2026, it was time to take it to the next level. Realistically, taking it to the next level means organization, structure, making sure we can actually answer emails because instead of uh not responding to stuff because I'm live all the time, I have someone to help me out. Meetups, getting a lot more formalized results. So, really excited for it. We have a lot of stuff to talk about and uh it's a pretty close-knit community and I'm here every single day. There's something very special with being a live streamer and talking to an audience and getting roasted by the chat every single day. So, uh, the only way to really make this official is if we have the manager getting Gracie in the community. She's already been in the chat for the past couple weeks.
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. You've already got to know.
>> It's been It's been It's been wild. [laughter]
>> So, now we're here live.
>> All right. So, let's get into it. Jess, who the hell are you and and how did you how did you get here?
>> How did I get here? Um, well, I am I am Jess. I've been working in public relations for 10 years. I started off um in agencies. I worked for three different agencies, global agencies. Um and then I took some time off to get sober. Um I was drinking heavily. I started um drinking when I was 8 years old.
>> Dude, when she told me that I was like, "You mean 18, right?" She was like, "No, eight." I'm like, I don't think 8-year-olds get access to alcohol. She's like, well,
>> they do in Cuba, [laughter] apparently. And so, um, spent 20 years drinking, tried to stop for 10, and finally took matters into my own hands, got myself off. Um, started to really work on myself, started to pay attention to what was going on around me more, and now, uh, now I'm here with you lovely people. So you worked at Canada's largest management talent agency for the past 10 years. Uh what was that experience like? Because although you were not sober during that time, you were, you know, the reason you stayed employed at the highest of levels is because you were working your ass off. So what was that entire experience like?
>> Crazy. It was crazy. I got a lot of I just got to grow up really fast. Uh it took a lot of maturity at a young age. not a lot of women or even men my age working in these fields. So, I had to prove myself and that really um fueled the alcoholism more because I just needed to keep banging [ __ ] out and I had to puzzle through it and push through. It was the only way I knew how. Uh so now we've developed healthier coping mechanisms.
>> Yeah. And look, the the reason I I love that story is because it's authentic. It's real. Uh, I am not a cookie cutter person. I've not had a cookie cutter journey. So, I don't want to be managed by someone who's like cookie cutter and just like a suit. Like, we're not a suit. We're a retail investing community. We make fun of the suits, you know? So, uh, I think that that honesty is really important. And the way that we met was through a mutual connection, who is your uncle, at the Miami meetup. And uh you know we I barely talked to him at the Miami meetup but I we ended up exchanging numbers and I'm really happy we did because then we got into contact back in November and you know he pitched me on a lot of different ideas on how we can make the meetups more structured organized. He has run nightclubs in Mexico for the past 40 years. So just like his event planning experience was pretty big
>> and then he introduced me to you. So
>> yeah,
>> which is great. We have him to thank
>> guys. We get it. She's cute. Okay, we get it. Goodness gracious.
>> No, this is great for my ego continue. [laughter]
>> She's cute. Wow, she's beautiful. Oh my goodness, she's gorgeous. It's like, yes, we get it. All right. [laughter] You know, I refuse to. So, I got so many questions before we did the stream. They're like, "Is she cute? Is she hot?" I'm not answering because I knew you guys would just be freaking crazy.
>> Decide. [laughter]
>> You guys decide. Okay. So, we got a lot of stuff a lot of stuff to talk about, a lot of stuff to go into. Um I think we'll start off with the let's start off with these two things then we'll do the meetup stuff. So okay next year I want to take the channel to a little bit of a different direction in regards to collaboration. So I am putting two Google sheets right now in the chat. I'm going to explain both of these and uh then I'll explain kind of Jess's role here. So two things and I already mentioned this before but we're going to make it official now. I am looking for market open and market close contributors, aka people that essentially are like uh Jose, right? That hop on the stream, they're an expert at some type of niche and then they're able to actually contribute whether it's 10 or 15 minutes and like actually explain uh about a topic or or a situation. So, there's the link right there in the chat. And I already said this a couple weeks ago, but if you are an expert in your niche, semiconductors, AI, oil and gas, Matt, you don't need to sign up because we're going to have Matt on every week no matter what to explain how to not bagold BG because now I own that stock. But, uh, then please sign up and Jess is going to be going through a lot of these applications. It's relatively simple. It's just, hey, what do you understand? Can you give us some links of stuff you talked about in the past? And, uh, the market open has started to grow. I mean, it's averaging around 9,000 people every single morning. So, I think the distribution for your brand or for anything you're trying to build or just your expertise is something that we can provide. Um, I say we now because there's two. [laughter] It's just it's a one. It's a oneman show. It's all it is. But yeah, Jess,
>> you'll be going through me now.
>> Yes, exactly. Be going through Jess. So, definitely sign up for that. And I just want to have more contributors from the community. Like, I'm sure there's so many people here that are experts at something. And like if you want to take a stab at social media or you know you have your own business and you want to just get more exposure for who you are, if you can get it through this community, I think this would be really cool. And so please sign up to that. And I will put these links out later as well for those that that miss it. And then second link right here is podcast contributors. So if you are again an expert in your niche for 2026, I want to do a lot of long form podcasts. So these are podcasts that are 45 to 60 minutes over Zoom and I want to do them monthly. So, if you're an expert in bond yields, uh, every month I want to be able to talk to you for 45 to 60 minutes as a recorded video. We'll upload it to the channel, upload it on X, get you the distribution as well to the audience, um, and allow you to speak about bond yields because I kind of understand bond yields, but I don't really understand bond yields. So, having more experts are really important. So, part of the plan for next year is getting more of you guys that are trying to do something, build a brand, etc. onto the channel, be contributor. I mean Chris, Steve, Matt, all this happened organically and you know Tanner I go on his channel, he goes on my channel. So all that stuff I think we can accelerate next year and we'll do it from the podcast perspective and then the market open market close perspective. Sheet needs permissions. Okay, let me fix that. But yes, that's what that's what we're going to be doing. Second thing is the meetups. So Jess, why don't you explain a little bit more about how we're structuring the meetups this year?
>> Sure. So, um, we've picked an awesome location, um, in West New York. Um, we'll just be all coming together, kind of getting community, meeting each other, networking, um, getting some facetime with AMID as well. You get to ask some questions, um, and really just coming together to share knowledge, share experience, keep growing the community, keep building. Um, and a lot of people have voiced just like a a need or desire to get to know each other better, to have this one-on-one time and navigate certain and uncertain times together. So, this will be a great opportunity.
>> Yeah, Jess is uh Jess has been dealing with meetups and live events and she's been traveling to manage um like Coca-Cola and all these crazy brands, McDonald's over the past 10 years. So, she has a lot of experience in dealing with live events and you know the idea she had on structuring it, organizing it. The biggest issue we had in Miami is just like there's one of me, there's a lot of you. So, how do we get me to be able to see everybody because I think it's a failure if I don't get to at least talk to everybody for a couple minutes. And so, there's a lot of ideas we have to make that a lot better and uh more exciting for next year. So, this is going to be the link for that. It's on Eventbrite. Um, and it is going to be February 1st. the locations and everything is on the link from 12:00 p.m. to 6 p.m. It was going to be January 25th, but then we realized that football
>> sports
>> sports or that weekend. So, it's going to be February 1st. Uh there will be a ticket price. So, it will cost $75 to get access to this. And I just kind of want to break down what that $75 entails. So, number one, this is not a profitable venture for me. This is not a business. This is not trying to be a business. You guys know me for a long time now. I don't do Discord courses, sponsorships. I've never taken a single sponsorship on the channel. There's no five $10 a month to get access to any content. Realistically, the meetups are selfishly for me in in ability to connect with the people that are actually watching. So, there's people behind the screen every morning. Seeing them in person is the point of the meetups. And that's was the initial genesis of the idea last year. Ended up being pretty successful over the past five meetups that we've done. But we want to take it to the next level. To take it to the next level, you need to have money. So, there's a venue cost, there's a security cost. We're going to take security very seriously. There's a food cost, alcohol cost. All of that results in 75 bucks. I think maybe there's two, three bucks at the end left in margin. A lot of that will be reinvested back into the meetups. So, I hope 75 is not crazy. It's not 100, not 200. It's it's not 30 bucks. And maybe one day we'll be able to get the cost to be lower. One day maybe this will become a really profitable business where 10,000 people sign up to some stadium and we have like an OLED summit and that might make a lot of money. But that's not today. And today it's it's the it's the putting in the ground work to really set up this community.
>> It will cost some money but hopefully 75 is is not too crazy.
>> It's going to be a great time. A great time. A boozy brunch.
>> Yeah. So what are we what are we doing there? It's a brunch. Mimosas brunch. Good food. Good people. Good music. A great view. A beautiful view. Um, and yeah.
>> Yeah, I think it'll be fun. It'll be fun. And see, and the the good thing about this here is like once if this works out well and we know how to structure it, then Chicago, so Nate stops asking and LA and Houston and all that stuff.
>> Yeah, we we should have made it $67. We should [laughter] That actually would have been way better. That would that would have done way better. But um yeah, that it'll it'll set up the framework to be able to rent out other venues across the world and and keep this going. So yeah, that's the idea. Can you go live during the event? We might. We're working on a lot of different things. Maybe we'll live stream. Maybe we're going to figure it out. But at least for the first one, we want to get it out of the way and yeah, we'll keep going from there. So that's the link right there. So 300. We're capping it at 300. Uh, I don't even know if we're going to get to 300, but if we do, then 300 is the limit because I think above that is too much. In the future, we'll see if we go from there. Yes, we will do Toronto again because
>> the Canadians in the house.
>> She loves Toronto and I I love Toronto, too. [laughter] But she is from Montreal more than she likes that more than Toronto. All right. So, those were the uh those were the major announcements and now we're just going to sit and chill, take any questions. [laughter] We get it. She's cute. Okay. Goodness.
>> Who me? [laughter]
>> She's so pretty. She's all this. You know, you know this is funny. I was like, "Yo, Jess, are you religious?" She was like, "No, but I'm Oh, you're spiritual." [laughter] It's like every girl. I was like, "No, I'm not religious. I'm spiritual. There's a divine femininity that I connect to.
>> There is.
>> And I was right. Of course, I was right.
>> There is. And it's powerful.
>> Well, hopefully it's gonna be really powerful next year to keep this going. All right. So, we'll do some Q&A. Um, let's start off with this. What was it like growing up in in Montreal?
>> Um, interesting. I grew up with very Greek grandparents and and their children were Greek, too. But um had to speak Greek at home and Montreal is um is in Quebec. Quebec is a Frenchspeaking.
>> It's the North Korea of Canada. [laughter] And Tanner affirmed what I said, what I was thinking.
>> Yeah, it's [laughter] a lot. And um so that was that was interesting to navigate. Um but it's beautiful. Lots of snow, very cold. The roads suck, but that's okay because it's all part of the thetik. It's all part of the beauty of Montreal.
>> But did you like did you did you appreciate Canadian culture grow? Like what is there a Canadian culture that you like resonate with?
>> There is um you know Canada is just it's beautiful land. Like it's just a beautiful place and to get lost in its parks and and explore nature it's it's it's absolutely beautiful. they [ __ ] up quite a bit with some things [laughter] when it came to the population and how they handled it. So, I don't know that I'm super proud of that right now, but um but I love where I'm from and it's afforded me everything I have today.
>> Okay. So, if you get to pick a choice between being American and Canadian,
>> would you would you I ask this to Tanner all the time and he still swears by Canada even though he's not. Yeah,
>> he's a full-on capitalist. I don't know.
>> I'm Canadian.
>> Okay, so you're you're more loyal than
>> Yeah. [laughter]
>> Um, okay. Here's a good question. Does she invest?
>> Do I invest? Well, so my investing journey started at a very young age. My grandfather, when I was born, um, took a couple of dollars and put it into some some bank stocks, some Disney stocks. Um, and that grew as I was getting older, being managed by my dad and my grandfather, and then uh passed off to me. But then like I grew up in a really like the immigrant mentality of we have nothing and don't touch anything because it's not there. So to me, I never really saw those investments as like my own wealth, just something that exists that I didn't really understand. And it it brought a lot of anxiety. um just like not understanding the full extent of it and and and you know just like holding on for dear life to whatever you have. Um and that's what kickstarted investing for me.
>> Yeah. So she's not kneede into like oh my goodness Broadcom's down 10% and you know what Broadcom is?
>> No.
>> No. Okay. So she shouldn't like you shouldn't care about that. So, we're definitely going to turn her into someone who watches the uh candlesticks all day
>> and make her excited about the markets. But, no, I like this because it's like
>> the the the investing community once you get a a sniff of it, like you become a bit obsessed
>> and all of us here have that moment, you know, and maybe you have that moment, maybe you don't, but
>> I know you're excited about the concept.
>> Well, I'm here for a reason. [laughter] So, yeah, definitely.
>> Yeah. So, I think that will that will be exciting as well.
>> Get me on the predictions.
>> Yeah, we need to get you on the prediction markets as well. By the way, guys, I just interviewed someone uh like 30 minutes ago. That interview will be out next week, but let's just say they work at the Hood of the Robins. It's not Vlad, someone else. I think you guys will enjoy it. Um, we talked a bit about prediction markets, so that'll be out next week as well. Uh, favorite movie. That's a That's a good one.
>> Favorite movie? Rent.
>> It's a classic.
>> Yeah. Rent. Definitely.
>> That's a great one.
>> I own it on DVD.
>> Really?
>> Yes.
>> You You liked it that much that you own it?
>> Oh, yeah.
>> It's a classic.
>> It's a great movie. I really like the part where the guy like
>> does that thing.
>> Does that thing?
>> Yeah. It was great. Yeah.
>> Yeah. A key moment in the movie. And then he couldn't pay the rent, right? Nope.
>> Which is why he had to work.
>> And then they were singing about how are they going to pay.
>> Exactly. And so they became a musical and
>> and here we are. The rest is history.
>> And I like musicals.
>> I love musicals.
>> There you go.
>> I love musicals. I don't care if that makes me something.
>> Okay. She hasn't watched Rounders, though. So you're you're not a big movie person.
>> No.
>> Which is another thing that's perfect here.
>> I was busy drinking. [laughter]
>> I didn't have much time.
>> Okay. So let's let's
>> priorities.
>> Let's get deeper into that. How does one even access alcohol at 8 years old?
>> Okay, so you go to a resort with your parents and you meet someone who's drinking. My favorite thing on earth is anything blue raspberry. Like I just will eat that [ __ ] up. And so I saw this girl with a blue raspberry slush and I asked her what it was. She goes, "It's a Blue Mountain." I said, "Bet. Go to the bartender. I asked him for a blue mountain and he's giving me like seven of six or seven of these a day. [laughter]
>> Dude, we are too old to be We are too old to be doing this [ __ ]
>> It's okay. I'm crashing out. [laughter] And so, [snorts] um I And I was drinking those for like a week straight and like I'm passing out all over the place. I'm like they're putting chairs together because I can't keep my eyes open. And I'm like asking my mom, please like, you know, let's take one of those golf carts to your to your room. And she's like, get up. I'm taking a golf cart. Like, what is this? So, [laughter] finally on the last day, I asked my mom like, "Can I please have one more Blue Mountain for the road?" And my mom has a sweet tooth. So, finally, she actually took a sip of it. And her eyes, like, I was terrified. Never mind the bartenders and what they were about to hear. I was I knew that was it for me. And uh it turns out it was that blue carac liquor with rum
>> and crushed ice
>> and I was a very small child
>> and so
>> it essentially created a subliminal uh desire correct for alcohol.
>> Exactly. And then after that, especially in Greek families, like with a lot of night life and just, you know, a lot of gettogethers that involved alcohol. So, at which point was it like, well, she she can have a glass of wine,
>> right?
>> The damage has kind of been done, [laughter]
>> right? Um, and then yeah, I got this really big affinity for alcohol and and I was drinking a bottle of tequila a day and chasing that with a bottle to half a bottle of wine. Um, that went on for the last 10 years. And those 10 years is like I every single day was day one. I was trying to today I'm not going to drink. Today I'm not going to drink. Today I'm not going to drink. And then finally I really stopped. I didn't really have a choice. It was going to be that or no
>> something way worse.
>> Yeah. And I I I think I think people
>> I I think people can relate to this if you if you've you know gone through the alcoholic route. You know to me it's it's so interesting because I grew up around so much alcohol because my dad had a liquor store but he didn't drink. My mom didn't drink. So then I never ended up like really drinking. But but like I can only imagine at eight years old you end up having a fun resort and subliminally you get because we all have things that happen at a very young age that end up forming the basis of our like when I was young like I I would I would make jokes and like my mom would laugh so that told me I'm meant to be a comedian and so now I get to make jokes in front of people every single day. So like you know again subliminally creates the foundation.
>> Yeah. But like that's a real thing. And so, okay, bottle of tequila a day while you're at a high functioning management job.
>> How did you eventually tell yourself it's time to get off that?
>> Uh, well, like I said, it was it was really like 10 years coming. Um, I just knew it in my body. Like my body felt like battery acid. I yeah I I was really it was that day that I was wrestling with the bottle because I wasn't drinking out of glasses or cups at that point. So
>> and I had the bottle on the floor and I picked it up and I was going back and forth with it and I really felt in my bones I'm like this is going to be a like if I drink this right now that's it. And so I struggled a lot. I cried a lot and then I tossed the bottle to the ground. I got myself in an Uber. I went to the doctors and I said, "You're going to put me on something or I'm going to find it myself." Um, got on some SSRI just to take [laughter] the edge off a bit. Um, and then finally I weaned myself off of those two and I'm raw dogging it.
>> Yeah. I mean, dude, it's I have a lot of respect for someone who can go through that type of journey and any type of addiction. You know, alcohol is just obviously a a more aggressive addiction, but
>> once you get off of it, it's like a new life. So, okay, so it's been two years sober. What is that experience been like and the clarity
>> you might have received from it?
>> The clarity is coming in now. So, I'll be two years in April. Um, it the first six months was really just like breaking down and I I couldn't move. I wasn't showering. I was showering once a month and it was even that was hard. Like I really couldn't take care of myself at all. But I just kind of like I trusted my divine feminine being and I just knew that like the worst was done. I needed to push through that period. And there was a lot going on, a lot of uncertainty in my life. A lot of I mean I'm living alone. I'm doing the thing and
>> being independent. being independent and um and I remember my mom was looking at me one day and she was just like visibly concerned and I told her I'm like just trust me like I know what it looks like right now but in a year from now I'm going to be a completely different person and trust me it's going to be okay and like no one wants to see their kid going through that. No one wants to see their kid in that state. So she like
>> she believed me but she was just so terrified which I completely understood. And then and then slowly slowly the clarity started to come. Um I really crashed out. I had to completely like break down and really hit a bottom and a low. Feel depths that I've never felt before. Feel highs that I didn't think I would ever feel and learn how to sit with those emotions. Learn how to exist with them. Um, it also brought a lot of light to how I was acting. Uh, my behavior, not just like in relationships or with my friends or family, but even at work, like rather maybe not toxic behavior, but I had so much anxiety constantly. The alcohol was suppressing the anxiety. It was allowing me to work through the anxiety.
>> So, seeing how I mean, I wasn't very communicative with people. I wasn't um you know and whatever I was saying it wasn't what I actually was feeling and meant. And so now that I actually live that way, it's opened up a whole other universe for me and I I kind of love it.
>> Someone said this is perfect. I just woke up and I'm so hung over. [laughter]
>> Oh my gosh,
>> dude. The first time we met, I thought we were going to like have our meeting and go get drinks and then she drops this on me and I'm like, "Well, we're not getting drinks. That's that's not happening."
>> No. [laughter] But
>> but like just cuz I can't have fun doesn't mean everyone else should. And I'd still go out. That was the other part that was really weird for me too. Working in PR, being in events and having an uncle in night life, having a lot of really cool family members that like having a good time, you know, how do you just like stop your life? And I grew up in bars for various different reasons. I I was just always connected to night life. So when I got sober, I'm like, well, what the hell do I do now? And um I started to write um and I started to go to bars and people were looking at me like what are you doing? Like you're this is setting yourself up for failure. And the reality is that I'm so honest about my story and I'm so honest about where I'm at. The second I walk into any establishment, I tell people very clearly, I'm an alcoholic. I want to be able to come here and enjoy myself. Under no circumstances do I ever want to be in a position where I'm potentially going to drink something by accident. There's going to be alcohol in it. And also, it keeps me accountable.
>> Yeah. Because now there are thousands of people that know that this is my story and they if they ever were to catch me in a position, you know, like it it really it's accountability, taking ownership of your life and just toughing it out.
>> Yeah. Look, this is the [ __ ] that I like. I like the the the raw authentic stories, like the real stories that like actually define a human. Especially like look, I'm not some massive company where I have a bunch of employees or anything like that. So to bring someone on to like I'm I've been pretty independent for the past four years. I have figured out how to build a brand, how to invest, how to manage an online community, you know, realistically by myself. There was no playbook to do this. So, if I'm bringing someone into the community, like I want someone who's dealt with some real [ __ ] you know, and who's honest enough to like not be afraid to tell their story and vulnerable enough to be okay with the transparency of like it's a process that you're getting better at and grateful enough where like because you've gone through that journey, you now know what it feels like to not be stuck in that phase.
>> Exactly.
>> Because we've all had phases that we've been stuck inactly
>> and right now it's such a weird time. Everyone's weird. Everything's weird. And you know, we need to like kind of show ourselves some grace. And I feel like, you know, just just own it. Like cuz, you know, people would tell me a lot too when I first started talking about my story and just explaining my situation and they were like, you know, you really shouldn't be as vocal about it because people are going to judge you. And I was like, dude, they're going to judge me anyway. So,
>> people judge me every morning. I mean, I uh tried to land some jokes this morning. It didn't land.
>> Didn't
>> But it's like
>> Why is that you think?
>> Well, that's a deeper philosophical conversation. But
>> no, I see the jokes definitely landed. There were some people that were laughing, but the majority were probably laughing at me, not with me. But that's okay because
>> a laugh's a laugh.
>> A laugh's a laugh. A laugh is indeed a laugh. Triple V, thank you for being here. Thank you for the $200 super chat. Uh, I might be meeting Triple V in a few weeks or a month. Jess might meet him. Do you know TripleB at all?
>> Okay,
>> I'm meeting this whole community right now. Yeah, in real time.
>> You'll you'll love him. He's he's an awesome guy. Um
>> I'm excited.
>> Steve, thanks for the super chat. Welcome, Jess. Hope it works 100%.
>> Thank you.
>> Spencer says, "Jess is a hottie."
>> Thanks, Spencer. [laughter]
>> And then Matt, thanks for the super chat. Can she make you show up on time?
>> I'll do my best. You can hold me accountable. It's like, dude, the last couple minutes before going live, it's impossible. So, yeah, we're gonna we're gonna try to see what we can do. Um, poetry. Are you into So, so you do like writing.
>> Uh, are you into reading, fiction, non-fiction? Do you want to write fiction, non-fiction? How do you think of that work?
>> Really good question. Um I so I was writing poems for when I first got sober. It was all poems and it was there was one actually my uncle Angelo um he ended up like screenshotting it and printing it and posting it and it was like about sprinkles and unicorns and like seeing worlds like you know when when the when the the fog finally lifts. And then I started to cringe myself out a little bit too much. And I it started with like journaling, but then my mind started going places that it never was allowed to when I was drinking.
>> Um, and I started to just like play a lot of connect the dots with my own lived experience. I love talking to people. I love connecting with people and meeting them. And I love hearing their stories because you get to understand where everyone's coming from. We all come from different like walks of life. We've all experienced different things, but um there are some things that like remain true and and and I have because I've felt those depths and I've allowed myself to
>> You actually went through some [ __ ] in life.
>> Exactly. [laughter] So
>> people It's hard to like write about experiences or make music about stuff if you haven't lived through it.
>> Exactly. Exactly. And I find like even like even with therapists and stuff like I I find the best counselors, the best people that are in a position to support you are the ones who've actually lifted and been there. And that's kind of what I wanted to accomplish with my writing. I wanted to kind of just be a safe space for people to feel without feeling like they're gonna without feeling the shame and the guilt that often comes with a lot of these things and and a lot of these emotions for men especially.
>> Yeah.
>> Um and yeah, just kind of be a resource, maybe make some laughs.
>> Yeah.
>> Perspective.
>> I I I think I think if if your story also can help other people that are going through the same thing.
>> For sure. You know, that's a big deal
>> for sure. We're so not alone. And there's just so much love.
>> She is not moving in with me. She is not my girlfriend. You're not getting married. This one's You can't make these like grinder jokes and [laughter] then do a 180 like that. By the way, she knows these jokes, too.
>> I do. And I saw some coming through there, too. It's all right.
>> Yeah. So, like this is not Guys, you cannot have it both ways. Like if you're gonna pick one. Like not do not not harass me from both sides. Like pick one.
>> But no, she is uh you know in all seriousness like I I really did need help going into the future. Like there's just no way to scale whatever we're I mean I got some big dreams going into the next five years. I mean just like the past two years have showed me where this could go. And then the question becomes do you have the work ethic, the ambition, the the ability to generate um people that actually give a [ __ ] You know, like I could have hired any random person that could do it like, you know, handle your emails. Like we're talking about someone who's going to be with you for the next 5 to 10 years, go on a journey with you and participate in the upside of that journey.
>> Yeah.
>> And you know, I was I was telling you about Derek. Derek is also a friend of the chat. TripleB is a good friend of Derek. And he had uh someone who essentially became his like life manager and handled a lot of stuff for him like 30 years ago. And they're still tight. Tight as ever
>> and like they're not like best friends.
>> It's gonna be us.
>> Yeah. Well, I mean like the only way for that to happen is if you have a real bond with someone and you both are like motivated to go to that next level together.
>> Yeah.
>> And so that was cool. And honestly, just seeing this, seeing you in your element the last few times that we've met, I feel like I kind of I want to take that lift off of you because there's so much exciting things coming down the pipeline and there's so much for you to do and grow with this community. And so, if I can just like take some of that lift off of you.
>> Yeah.
>> Do I swear too much?
>> No, you don't. It's [laughter] just like this. No, you don't. But it's uh it is it is a rampage of comments.
>> I'm classy. I promise.
>> She's doing a good job. She's managing the chat. [laughter] I mean, I have to deal with this [ __ ] every day and I've learned how to deal with it. So,
>> she's in love. Oh, don't put words in my mouth. [laughter]
>> Mixed babies is ridiculous. Actually,
>> right after the Grinder comment is excellent.
>> Yeah, it's like
>> our [clears throat] kids will see that one day. [laughter]
>> There you go. That's what's going to happen.
>> Um, okay. Let's ask you some stock questions. So, do do you I actually never asked this, so I don't know what the person Do. Do Do you Do you know what like Palenture is?
>> I do.
>> Like, okay. So, what does Paler do? [laughter]
>> You don't want me to answer that?
>> Okay. Uh, someone's been reading CNN a little too much. Um,
>> the oh no started. [laughter]
>> That's why we can't get married, guys. like, "No way that's going to work." No way. Um,
>> my uncle calls me a snowflake.
>> Okay. So, no, no, she like she's a snowflake, but then when you get deeper into the conversations, she's a raging conservative. So, I But I feel like that's a lot of Canadians. Like,
>> you're like you got the snowflake feel, but then when you go a little deeper, some stuff that your country has done has pissed you off so much.
>> Yeah, horribly. I mean, we have language police. What the heck is that? Okay. So, let's talk about what what do you feel about the Quebec language enforcers?
>> I think that if your medical system works, if your roads don't have craters in them the size of actual planets, that can cause a lot of damage to cars, that can hurt people. that everything is working and you are a functioning society,
>> then I think yes, you should protect your culture. I'm super proud. I'm Greek. I'm very proud of my my heritage and my roots. I'm also proud to be Canadian. Um, so I completely understand wanting to protect something. Um, but I don't necessarily agree with pushing millions of dollars into two different types of literal police for language to enforce this to the point where people are getting fined on Facebook if they post in English. I get it and I understand, but it's just there's like too much going on. It's a little tonedeaf. It's a little it's a waste of money. It's a waste of taxpayer money.
>> It's authoritarian. Like it's
>> the fact that you said every sign has to be replaced in French. Like I get protecting the language, but I mean imagine America did that. Imagine every democracy said we're going to protect this one thing and like for all the [ __ ] America gets like we we try to embrace a lot of cultures. Yeah.
>> And it's like we get a lot of [ __ ] But then the place that actually don't embrace other are the ones that are like seen as
>> Yeah. And I feel like when you're put like so I'm a little bit jaded because I did grow up with again my grandparents were Greek so I spoke to them in Greek. We spoke English at home and then school had to be French and I mean she was drinking at 8. So like I had things on my mind and I wasn't really the most studious for the French language. Uh it was it just it it came a little bit harder for me. Then going into high school, I had French teachers who would like tell me they hated me in front of students
>> because you didn't speak the language.
>> Because I just I wasn't getting things and like they would get super frustrated with me and not really I don't think that's a fair way to teach people. But then as I grew up, I realized that my story resonated with a lot of people. A lot of people went through the same thing.
>> Yeah. And there is sort of like a snarky attitude that comes with like the French which I kind of like embrace sometimes when I'm in that mode but it you know you you can't act that way and it's kind of detering people from if you're pushing it down their throats and you're instilling fear into people instead of promoting it like a beautiful language something an opportunity to you know grow your mind expand your horizons like very very different messaging. Maybe they need like a PR rebrand on on the French.
>> Well, it's not the entirety of Canada, right? It's just
>> No, it's just Quebec.
>> Yeah.
>> Like they speak French in different provinces. It's just
>> the the the in Quebec that it's it's it's it's by law that it's enforced. Like they go to my mom's office and and check to make sure that her keyboards are French and if there's Crazy.
>> Yeah, if the keyboards aren't in French, then fines, fines, fines, fines. And we pay a lot in taxes. Like a lot.
>> Yeah, she was telling me the tax percent. I mean, I know Canada's crazy, but like that's
>> pretty wild. Shout out to Pedro. You just bought a ticket for him and his wife. Looking forward to it. Uh, again, I will have more updates. Uh, we got about two months until we have the meetup, so I will constantly make sure that everyone is updated on it. But New York, February 1st, and if you're making a weekend out of it, then you know, you fly in a couple days before and then you could fly out that uh that Monday morning. Um, what what do you think about Elon Musk?
>> Do you hate me? [laughter]
>> I actually haven't asked you that question. So, you just got a lot of Tesla investors in the chat, so choose your words wisely. Like,
>> I think that
>> he's a visionary. He's changed the world.
>> He was I mean uh Grimes is uh from Quebec.
>> Is he from Quebec?
>> So I guess his child is by proxy sort of
>> Canadian
>> ish.
>> Well, he's Canadian. No, no, he's South Africa.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> I think that he should do some more media training. [laughter]
>> That's what I think you should. Again, it's all about messaging. as long as you're positioning yourself in a certain way, you know, it makes the the the nonsense and the noise like kind of cancel out a bit.
>> Look, but Elon fans are going to hate that you say that and there's a lot of Elon haters that are like, "Yeah, he needs to work on messaging." So, that's fair. Um, do you do you uh are there any companies that you buy products from that are like uniquely tailored towards your demographic like Lululemon or any of these brands? Are there any of these that you get like Starbucks? Like are you a coffee person?
>> I drink Red Bull. I shouldn't.
>> Really? You drink?
>> Yeah, I drink Red Bull
>> like every day.
>> Not as much. I when I stopped drinking like Dead to the World, four Red Bulls a day like to the face and that was crazy. But um I guess makeup would be
>> Yeah. Like E.L.F. Ulta. Is that your thing? We're asking because we're trying to like there's a lot of these stocks that are public and I'm just curious if
>> Revlons are public. No. Is Revlon public?
>> I don't know if Revlon's public.
>> I think Revlon's public. So, Revlon.
>> Okay. So, that that So, so like if you had to name a couple brands you really interact with
>> a lot.
>> All right. 11. Are you materialistic?
>> No. That's the problem.
>> That's why because I can't answer that question either because I don't shop anywhere.
>> I'm like I shop once every like seven, eight years. And I just
>> like clothes, shoes. You're not someone who's like
>> I mean, dude, I'm the same. I really I don't shop
>> again. I was busy. [laughter]
>> That's true. You're a little busy.
>> No, I just I I Yeah, I liked I like spending my money on traveling. I like spending my money on I like spending my money on alcohol. I like spending it on food. And then everything else, like a hoodie works.
>> Yeah, I'm the same. I really do not care that much about about materialistic stuff.
>> Um, Estee Ladar. Do you know them?
>> Estee Lauder.
>> Oh, you're saying it wrong.
>> I am.
>> Yeah.
>> Ladar.
>> It's Ladar.
>> Ladar. [laughter]
>> I don't know how the Montreal people.
>> I don't know the Canadians say it, but
>> we say Lauder.
>> Estee. Ladar.
>> Yeah, my mom uses that.
>> Uh, Robinood. What do you think about Robinood as a company? I think that you made some really good. [laughter] You did some really great forecasting. The golden card.
>> Okay. So, we we're going to get her on the Robin Hood app so that she can actually
>> I don't I don't think I can because Canadian Yeah, we don't have that.
>> Got to get her in Canada, folks. Gotta get her in Canada.
>> Okay, so I think uh I think we'll wrap up here, but again, this was an introduction stream. Um I mean you guys will see her here and there potentially on the channel. Um you know we might do this again in the future but realistically this was just to introduce you guys to her. Someone said amit um I think someone said at the top I want to get in contact for the thing. So here's the email that his official email putting in the chat. Jesskcoms.com that is her official email. with me. We'll discuss.

If there's any big requests, any business things, any like media things, opportunities, that's the email. I also have a new email as well, which is just emit acoms.com. But this should be the official email if you want to get in contact. AK Media was taken. I couldn't get AK Media.
