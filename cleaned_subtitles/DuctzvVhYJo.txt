[Music] hi everyone I'm Nicola tangin and today I'm in really good company with Julie sweet the CEO and chair of Accenture which is one of the world largest and most influential Professional Services Company and under her leadership Accenture has led the way in digital transformation Innovation and helping businesses worldwide to harness the power of technology and we are lucky because in the fund we own more than 1% of the company worth more than $2 billion so welcome jie thank you for having me today now you employ more than 7 100,000 people which is more people than in the whole of Oslo and so how do you run a company like that with a lot of help so I've got a great leadership team and uh we have a really good way of operating so one of the things I first did when I became CEO was to actually change the way that we were organized so that we could be much closer to our clients and our people because as you scale it's really important that your leaders are close to your people stupid question what does Accentra actually do it's a great question so uh so if you think about uh we we work for governments and for companies but sticking with a company for a moment so if you think about a company we help our clients reinvent literally every part of their company using technology data and AI to do one of two things to either grow more or to be more efficient like that's the very simple thing so that means that we'll do everything from helping BBVA um have uh their customers be able to join the bank in minutes instead of a week so that's all about growth to um helping a company be able to take out major costs using technology and Ai and their Finance function that's about efficiency to um helping uh clients who make things so who manufacture things digitize so we helped Mars for example if you like uh Skittles we helped make sure that you get the exact number of Skittles in your Skittle package not one more or one less and so and all of those things at the heart are combining technology data and AI with deep industry knowledge where do companies need the most help just now well top of everyone's agenda is how do I use AI yeah and what I would tell you that where they really need the most help still is that most companies today are not as digital as they need to be no so they haven't built the digital core that allows them to use AI so they start with help me with AI and then very quickly we are helping clients understand what does it take to actually be able to use AI but for you to help them you need to learn it first right we have a very strong culture of learning yeah uh so for example I don't know if you're familiar with the Gallup strength finder so we use Gallup strength finder for Accenture and um that is something that helps people evaluate what their strengths are so we have 700,000 people over 300,000 people have used this tool how does it work and so basically it assesses you against 34 strengths and the theory is that you should do things that are your strengths and do less of things that are not your strengths so there's 34 different strengths so they're neutral like they're all strengths it's just which ones you have so we have over 300,000 people who've gone through the assessment it's very rapid our number number two strength is learner and so our people are Learners they like the process of learning the number one strength by the way is responsibility meaning they say what you do so if you think about in my business right that's super important and why do I say that's important uh the the learner piece is important is because when things change all the time you have to have people who Embrace change and embrace learning what's the key to get the speed up to work faster as a firm uh two things one a culture that Embraces change two a growth model a way of organizing and and um and operating that supports it so we when I joined Accenture in 2010 the CEO said we're all about change that is our culture um when you think about what do you have to do to um actually operate in different ways when we set our strategic goals we don't set them on a fiscal year because life doesn't move on a fiscal year I uh I think in the past you were more like a fast follower and now you are a change agent what does it take to install that type of culture manm so um well it's interesting though so when I joined Accenture the CEO said two things he said I when I asked him about the culture he said we're all about change and we're fast followers and so we then that was in 2010 in 2013 we missed revenue for only I think the second time in our history we knew that every business would be a digital business and at that time to be a digital business bu you had to be an innovator and so we were able to articulate that we wanted to keep the culture that Embraces change in fact that would enable us to embrace digital but we had to change the culture that was about being a fast follower the most important thing I tell CEOs when they say I need a cultural changes can you articulate what you want to keep what you need to change and what you need to become and so we said we need to go move from Fast follower to innovator I will tell you Nikolai if you can just master that you'll be able to change your culture but what is the key so now you come into a company do you you spend time learning about the company learning about the processes and so on and just what do how do you how do you attack that kind of thing so how do if the question is how do we help companies change right we do it in a couple of different ways so one we do have to deeply understand the culture and you know what we're walking into our top 100 clients have been our clients for over 10 years so many many of our clients we've actually worked with for a very long time and so part of what we often bring is a deep knowledge of the company but not always we have lots of new clients as well so you do have to understand that but the other piece is a lot of what we're bringing our clients along is things that other companies have already done right so you're in a consumer goods company consumer goods companies face very similar cultural issues like there's always the tension between Global and and local markets for example that's true in every consumer goods company right so we bring a lot of Industry expertise on both what are the challenges what are the opportunities and so a lot of what clients come to us for is that every Journey shouldn't be bespoke right they want our help in making sure that we can they can learn from other companies lessons are you surprised to which extent all the companies are struggling with the same things not surprised I think that um you know like we I the more I do this the more I say regardless of Industry people are the same companies are the same uh it's a great part of what we bring is that Insight uh and so having now been Global CEO for five years um not a lot surprises me strike me that uh you know people generally don't particularly want to share information they think a bit too shortterm they think a bit too much on themselves about themselves and uh your job as a CO is kind of stretch the company in different directions and people in different directions but it just seems like all companies are struggling with the same things they all talk about bidding down silos sharing information I think um you're you're absolutely right companies are facing the same things I love that the example of silos um they also all have terrible data and a lot of times the data terrible data is because of the silos right um and and I think that's because companies grew up you know there was a certain way of running companies right so everybody's gone to that and what's one of the things that I think is hard is having that culture of real innov ation that's not about product but it's about yourself right so most of the time people think of innovation they think about new Innovative products when was the last time people were saying well I want my finance function to be the most Innovative Finance function I want to be the way we operate and so a lot of what we're trying to help companies do is to understand that they need to reinvent every aspect of what they do not just have the most Innovative products but to actually reinvent the way they're working and the way they're operating theirselves and the companies who Embrace this idea of continuous reinvention of everything that they're doing that mindset are going to be the ones that succeed in the next decade but a lot of people don't particularly want to change yes and no I would say um one of our leadership Essentials at Accenture is the courage to change and the ability to bring people along the journey and so often times it's less about people not wanting to to change and more about not having the leadership that helps them change and what the key to that leadership now how are you so so now you going to we work together how are you going to get me to change so the first thing is to have Clarity of where you want to go and so what's the north star the second is putting people first meaning understanding how a person is going to experience that change if I'm telling you a North star that has nothing to do like you're not going to benefit from it you're part of the Legacy business so you're not going to the the best business that's not going to be very compelling if we're asking you to change and so Clarity of vision and then the ability to understand how each person's going to experience it and then message to that person now you mentioned Ai and and how you are helping companies to change but how is it changing Accenture it's changing every part of Accenture um our strategy has been three things first and foremost we focused our investments we're investing a billion dollars a year $3 billion total we focused our investments on creating the solutions our clients need because we knew right we needed to be there for our clients the second part of our strategy was to reimagine using AI how we're delivering our services just like we did with the last round of intelligent automation we're embracing it we're moving fast to say okay how do we use this great technology to deliver our services differently and then the the third piece is how do we operate ourselves differently in our corporate functions and we are really clear about our strategy and how we're investing against that strategy so the 1 billion How do you how do you spend it what is it used for most of that is used for either creating um new new services so for example um we just announced a partnership with Nvidia where we created on top of their technology something called an AI Refinery that actually works on tops of their technology and all of the different um hyperscalers and that um is technology so we had to invest to create that solution which we can now deploy into clients so we create assets and solutions so our clients are not having to do everything bespoke that's a big part of our um investment another big part of our investment is in training so we are um creating we want to have 880,000 data and AI um new data and AI people total data and AI people by the end of 26 we're already at uh 57,000 and so there's a big investment in training so those are two of the big areas and there's some other areas as well how long training program do they need to go through uh it depends on um on the role right so and what you start with so for example last year we had about 250,000 technology people take the first set of intensive training that was between you know 15 to 20 hours another 130,000 took level two training which is like another 20 hours depending on role and so what we've done is to look rooll by roll and say what are the data and AI skills that are needed or who can we res skill to be data and AI Specialists what are the other things you're looking for in Consultants who you hire so you mentioned the ability to learn what are the other things well just on the ability to learn there's one question that we ask everyone regardless of you're a consultant or you're working in technology or whatever you do we have a lot of different skills at Accenture we say what have you learned in the last six months I share that with you because a lot of times people are asking me well how do I know if someone's a learner and it's a very simple way to know if someone can't answer that question right and by the way we don't care if it's I learned to b a cake right it's if they can't answer that question then we know that they're not a learner so I wanted to share that because I you know people are always looking for practical ways to assess whether someone's really a learning no not unexpectedly I'm going to ask you that question then so what have you learned last six months what have I learned in well I've so much about gen I'm spending all of my time at work learning completely about gen at home um I'm doing a lot of baking I've never been a big Baker but I am learning to bake more do you bake bread as well I'm not doing bread yet I'm doing um cakes so okay well that's I make a really good buttercake sounds good we'll uh bring you next time yes um any other skills which are important as a consultant in terms of interpersonal skills just what are what are what type of people are you looking for so we're looking for um people who are leaders and by leaders I'm not saying I I want them to be like the president of their class if they're coming from college but to demonstrate that they um work with others well that they do get involved you know so one of the things that we look for are people who who um actually have different activities and again not that they needed to be the president of the club but because if the only thing you do say a kid who come as school is to study and get good grades you're unlikely to be able to navigate the work um as well what do you think is next after after AI well first of all I think there's going to be multiple versions of AI so Genai you know is a big Trend today but we already seeing different kinds of AI that will come so I think the AI Revolution will continue in waves I do think that um Quantum is going to be a big you know part of um the technology landscape probably more three to five years out um but you know we're already doing work in that so those are you know two area sort of continued evolution of AI and then Quantum and which Industries are in your mind uh leading the development here and which are lagging well interestingly I think that every single industry has leaders in them so there's no industry where you say like once like once upon a time you'd say something like oil and gas was like totally lagging because we're in the middle of a digital Revolution and every industry has leaders what we're seeing is that every industry also has leaders in embracing AI I do think though that some of the usual suspects are not embracing it as broadly so energy is a sector that is lagging say what you're seeing in um anything that's direct to Consumer banking you know consumer goods in the dtoc and Retail now um just a bit more on on how you develop Talent so you hire from universities we do both so we hire from universities and we also do experience tires yeah uh at all levels so both managing directors and very senior people and also sort of people middle in the middle of their career and how do you how do you train them how does a a a carrier path look like so a couple of things that are important um we spend over a billion dollars a year on training so training um an employee gets an average of 44 hours a year in training so training um and Learning and Development is something that is a part of every year at Accenture we do have what we call Core schools and core schools are at different um key points in your career so for example when you you know are an analyst you have a course school because you're you know brand new when you're making when you make managing director we have something called MD momentum so and those core schools that occur at different key parts of the career are to get you ready for the next stage of your career but then we have a lot of other training certifications gen we had 500,000 people take our beginning gen course last year um we had another 300,000 take the level two course these are people other than you know the ones who are deeply technical so learning is really embedded in everything we do let's um change t a bit and talk about your leadership you mentioned that you have these uh programs where you map people's strength what is your super strength uh strategy so that's one of my super strengths and uh achiever is one of my super strengths and learner is one of my super strengths so those are all in my top five okay and and you were a lawyer by training I was I I I'm still a lawyer so but yes I trained as a lawyer what does that do to you what does that does it does it help you will hold you back I love being a lawyer because um lawyers are trained to process an amazing amount of information in a short amount of time and then they're asked to make a judgment and when you think about being a CEO for example at any given time I'm processing a ton of information and I have to make a decision right uh and so the legal skills have allowed me both to be a good just like the raw ability to process but also to w rapidly and objectively you know weigh the information in order to make a good decision so I think it's one of the best trainings uh especially now with so much change that anyone could have it's not the normal route to become a CEO it is not the normal route it's particularly in non-regulated Industries you know we're not a regulated industry um and I'm a big advocate of it however a lot of people come up through the finance way and CFOs and so on surprising to you through HR yes yes HR is uh increasingly important in fact uh if you think about I think the best thing to be right now one of the one of the best Fields is to be in HR because right after gen on CEO's agendas are is talent and talent and how you train Talent has to completely change what do your HR director do differently than other HR directors well um our HR is skills-based HR so we have over 700,000 people and we have a database of all of their skills so for example in the pandemic when um we suddenly needed a lot more people who could do Cloud we could run an algorithm and identify who had adjacent skills who we could train in just 20 hours to be able to do Cloud work and we believe passionately that all HR needs to be skills-based because if you think about ai ai takes away tasks not necessarily entire jobs and so you want to be able to take someone whose tasks have now been automated and you know teach them new skills and um in order to adapt and you got big numbers so you can do HR analytics in a different way than many other people right yes we're extraordinarily data driven so we really understand um our people um what they're doing what their interests are uh and most importantly the data around skills what's the coolest thing you can read out of your analytics what's the coolest thing um we have analytics that can predict if someone is going to uh look for another job what are the tell Tales uh there's a bunch of them so there's like 20 different variables that we look at and it's incredibly accurate and we use that to then make interventions if we see that someone is you know demonstrating um that is you know it's being kick on the analytics are saying is this person may be at risk what do you do then um we make sure we make no we make sure that there's someone engaging with that person they're checking in that they've got a sponsor we we have a bit of a problem in Europe because we have so strict gdpr but you don't really have that problem in the US we we have definitely different rules so some of the tools that we can use in the US we can't use in Europe yeah now when you joined uh you were the general Council right which is kind of the you what would you say it's like the head lawyer in The Firm right yes how were you groomed to take over the COO role what kind of guidance mentorship did you get um I think there were two pieces to that so one was the guidance so the the CEO um the the about a year after I started we had a new CEO U pnm and he went out of his way to um make sure that I understood why things were the way they did and so um and he was part of recruiting me he's actually one of the people that interviewed me but I think that in large part that was a reaction to my own attitude which is I follow something called the why rule which is I started when I was a young lawyer is that if I didn't understand why something was happening why a client said something why we gave certain advice I would go back as a young lawyer and ask the partner so when I joined Accenture I did the same thing I would sit in meetings and I would sometimes sit there and say well like why did that person say something why did why was this decision made and then I would go ask my colleagues so just I'm very senior then you know so that was different but the premise was the same and I think as a result of that people would go out of their way to explain to me something oh Julie you may not understand this because you weren't here or you know you may not know this part about the business and so you know one of the things I talk to a lot of people about in terms of career advice is that the Y rule it makes sense whether you're early in your career whether you're taking on a new role or changing company and then people respond to you being genuinely caring about why when you uh Mentor or are mentored by somebody how often should you sit down together I think that really depends on the person and the role um some mentors like to spend a lot of time you know others that would be annoying and so I think um what's most important when you're seeking mentorship is to be clear that what you're trying to do is be able to create more value for the company as opposed to it's all about me and to be genuinely connecting with someone and seeking to learn from them I think a lot of people make the mistake of thinking like taus means you know you're going to help me get the next job as opposed to networking for value and people feel appreciated when you go to them and you're genuinely seeking to learn from them can leadership be taught you think I do think leadership could be taught it was one of the eye openening things when I came to Accenture so I came from a law firm where we did no teaching on on leadership we did a lot of other teaching amazing training on how to be a lawyer but the actual art of leadership completely absent imagine I show up at Accenture and you know as I said we spend a billion dollars a year we do a lot of leadership development and I really began to appreciate that you cannot expect to have great leaders if you don't invest in helping train those leaders but how do you train them a couple of different ways one is on the job training right you want we really believe in the role of apprenticeship and role modeling and so when we promote leaders at every level we have something called leadership Essentials which are eight leadership Essentials and we use those to look at whether or not the leader we want to promote is actually a role model for the skills and the characteristics and mindsets that we want for all of our leaders so it's important that you're investing in training you're making sure that your words and your actions match so you're promoting people with the leadership characteristics so they can be Role Models um and that you're providing that sort of on the job training for leadership as well when you look at your own leadership how has that developed I think I've how did you find yourself as a leader what are your how how are you as a leader well I you know I think I'm pretty good uh so I'm always room for improvement I will tell you that uh of our eight leadership Essentials there's one that I particularly introduced that I think has been very important in my own um growth and it is lead with Excellence confidence and humility and Leaders with humility are Learners they create good teams because they recognize they don't have all of the answers and they're willing to challenge themselves and change and when I think about my leadership style I do really try to emulate that idea of Excellence confidence and humility to which extent are you stronger now as a leader than you were five years ago well a couple of things skills wise I work a lot about on communication and one of the advice that I give um all leaders at every level is that you can have the best ideas in the world but if you do not clearly communicate them in ways that people want to listen then you will not have an impact and so I work very hard at being an impactful communicator and so I think I've continued to develop that and then secondly you know if you think about the last five years right they've been very challenging years and I think I've grown as a leader in being able to just balance right that things you know there's tough times and there are good times and it's really important to be able to um understand that uh things are as once someone once said you never as bad as they seem and Never As Good as they seem and that creates a more of a long-term uh view um and and less volatility in leadership what do you think is key to good communication storytelling y uh so I I uh there's a great book that I recommend to everyone I should get I should get a cut of it um it's by a good friend of mine Andy Craig called weekend language it's very good I love it that's great I I love that you read it um and it really changed my communication style because people remember stories right that's the way that you have impact and at the end of the day if they don't remember what you say you can't have an impact so the book is about how funny and interesting people are during the weekend when they are in dinner parties and that kind of thing and they have anecdotes and details and all the interesting things and people off and then you come into the office on one day and they are so boring and there is something called the professional curse what is that that you just are dull right because you're so professional and you use long sentences and difficult words and nobody really exactly is hooked on what you say and you know the book talks about how you win or lose people in the first two minutes yeah and I think about that all of the time I think about it in a short conversation I think about it in a presentation um because you know it's so human right and we we've all been there that you know oh my God that person is so dry you know so how do you train people in the organization so all everybody in the Accenture are just running around telling stories being funny and Charming so it's interesting we have done a lot of training of our leaders on um weekend language we actually use end as a coach and now what we're developing really as a result of the age of AI is we're going to build in more structured communication training starting as a young analyst and the reason for that is that as AI augments people and allows them to do things you know sort of earlier in their career right because it's that's kind of giving them superpowers what it doesn't do is um give you that time back that that you need for apprenticeship and learning and so we believe that we need to focus on communication skills earlier in the career and so that's one of the things that we're working on now um really as a direct result of how we think the workforce is going to be impacted for AI and that we need better communication skills earlier now do you think this was related to you did debating um you were on a debating team when you were at school right I did both speech and debate and I absolutely built an incredible foundation and if there's any young students who are listening listening to this podcast they should absolutely do speech and debate I agree entirely Julia why is storytelling more important now than before we're in such a time of change that um most of the companies I'm working with what they're talking to me about is how do I help my people change you know how do you help me with change management and so effective communication being able to reach people emotionally um have them really understand what you're trying to do is absolutely critical and storytelling is all about that in fact we actually bought a company called the storytellers uh that it built their entire company around storytelling and change management so I I I highly recommend to CEOs that they invest in capabilities around change management around storytelling in order to bring their people along the journey what's the key to good storytelling the key need a good story telling uh having a story to tell right so that starts uh keeping it short y uh and not using any Consulting language okay so they use your Consultants to make sure they don't use Consulting language well it's it's so important to be and you know it's not just about Consultants right one of the things that I see across industry is that people fall into jargon of whatever their interest of their industry is and even if you understand the jargon that is not compelling and that's why it's so important regardless of Industry to really get away from jargon and tell stories plainly and authentically that's how you reach people and how does this impact the way you communicate internally well I start usually when I'm doing a presentation I always I think about um two things I think about the first two minutes so how is that going to go and I think about what's the stories that I want to tell to illustrate the points um and I do that in a very structured way because I know that if I could I can give a beautiful speech and I can be very logical about the new strategy but if I do not bring it to life they will not remember it'll be blah blah blah and if I don't grab people in the first two minutes they won't even listen and do you you use videos internally I use a lot of videos in internally so we're sitting here in uh you know in your studio basically yes we have a broadcast studio it's awesome we we do it so much we have it in uh many of our offices yeah now one of the things we should they recommend in the uh weekend language is not to use PowerPoint you know I am determined that someday we will eliminate PowerPoint at Accenture uh you know I I will tell you that today on my finance meeting so like when I'm doing a you know a quarterly review we have we use something called the Enterprise Navigator so we bring up in real time our financial data no PowerPoints uh so we're we're taking baby steps uh to getting away from PowerPoints why that bad because they become crutches right um they you know people then are reading the Powerpoints there um you're there's no stories on PowerPoints right so when I go to a client meeting I will you know almost never use slides I I've actually had clients say no you must bring slides where slide culture right um because I want to connect with people and to be able to communicate with them and people don't communicate by slides if you had to bring a slide what would it look like what does a good slide look like in your world uh very simple so should have you know very simple Graphics that you actually know what they mean we are famous in Consulting land for having Graphics that do not make sense at first glance and so you you know we have to explain them in very few words and big fonts and big fonts I read a book which said that well which there is research showing that uh if you have bigger fonts it gives more trust you trust more a person who has called big fonts on the slide that I have not heard I'm going to remember that now um I um read somewhere that you have a plaque at home which says if your dreams don't scare you they are not big enough that's right so roughly two years before I became the global CEO when I knew I was you know up for being the CEO my husband comes home one day with three plaques and he always likes these sort of kitchy sayings and that and he and these were really not attractive plaques and he wants to hang them in our house to inspire our daughters and you know after a bit of a tussle I said finally you can hang them at the back of a house in our mudro and he got the last laugh because one of them says if your dreams don't scare you they're not big enough and you know during those couple of years when you know here I was I was you know the general counsel you know trying to become the CEO I mean I at that time I'd worked as a North America CEO but that's a big you know leap as you said I'm the first CEO that didn't start out of college so you know at times it seemed like a very really big long shot and so it was comforting to say well it's not that I'm not able to do it it's not that I'm not qualified it's just that I'm dreaming big that I feel a little bit scared about whether I was going to make it um and I I use that now when I think about how to run a company right because because if as a leader as a CEO if you're complacent if you're not worried about whether your strategy is going to work then chances are you're not pushing the company and you're going to wake up and find yourself behind and similarly you know I try to tell people that when you're whether it's a young person taking a new job or someone mid-career moving jobs or moving companies right the fact that you're nervous doesn't mean you're not qualified it just means you're dreaming big that's a much more inspiring uh way to think about the moves you're making when were you last nervous I am nervous absolutely every day because we are pushing ourselves right we are operating at the edge of Technology right and you know our clients want us to have a healthy dose of humility which is what I think about when you're saying nervous right the humility to say I need to be extra careful I need to recognize that we're doing Cutting Edge work and I need to put in place you know and and and really be mindful right and humble that this stuff's hard now we got several things in common one thing is that we both had mothers who studied When We Were Young oh that's wonderful what did your mom study she studied art history and uh a few things related to that that's great and you did too yes my mom graduated my freshman year in college she's super inspiring yeah in what ways she's inspiring spiring because at that time right so this was in 1985 uh you know there weren't a lot of women in college certainly mothers in college um she was working part-time she had three kids and uh she had grown up on a farm so completely different environment uh and she you know went to school there was not many people who were her age there let alone women uh and she just went after her dreams and didn't let anything stop her and that's very inspiring when people ask me how they should spend that money I I tell them they should spend a lot on their mothers I agree absolutely you also studied in China right I did so I you know my parents didn't even own a passport and I went home one day when I was a senior in uh Co in high school and said I'm going to go study Chinese and I ended up spending a year between Taiwan and Beijing and it was an amazing very transformation experience in what ways it was the first time I was in a place where I didn't look like everyone else and I didn't speak the language you know I was still studying you know like two years of Chinese underneath my belt uh and so I had to demonstrate a lot of resilience um and uh you know I needed to navigate I didn't have a safety net back then I'm really you know I'm 57 so back then there were no cell phones right uh there was not sort of the easy button and uh and it also just taught me to look at things very differently because I was you know navigating I was The Stranger in another culture and it helped me be able to put myself in different people's shoes and made me more empathetic as a person how do you relax when you AR at work I spend time with my daughters I have two teenage daughters who I love and they are so much fun to be with and that's really you know for me family time is um how I relax how really love to spend my time when I'm not working and that's why you bake your cakes yes although um they really like my chocolate chip cookies right and what do you read I tend to read um like just uh Mur not murder mysteries but like terrorism type books you know like David bichi um uh I like kind of Escape not particularly highbrow you know fiction that is really fun sounds good now we got tens of thousands of young people listening to uh to this what advice would you give them two things um one of them is to live by this idea of lead your life with Excellence confidence and humility and I think it's so important you know I learned that from my dad and my dad painted cars for a living and he always believed that you know we could do anything that we set our mind to do and at the same time he was always very Frank when you know we weren't really in leading with Excellence where we weren't performing with excellence and so I think it's important to balance those two things and to have the humility to know what you don't know um to learn from others and to build great teams I think that's just super important the second piece is um to think about your life in a way to not have any regrets you know I had breast cancer um when I I was 47 and I had two young kids at the time and one of the things that taught me was that you know life can change very quickly and I have this like barometer in the way I live my life where I'll stop and I'll say if tomorrow you know I was diagnosed again with cancer I faced some kind of life-threatening illness would I have regrets about how I'm living my life right now and sometimes the answer is yes like you know I've committed to Too Much travel I'm away from my family and other times it's no like I'm I've got the right balance but it's important to ask the question right now I'm always cautious to say like if you're a young person you're going to have to work really hard okay like so yes you know it's not about like not working hard but it's about making sure that you're kind of looking at your life in the whole uh and uh and you know it's something that I've learned and I'd like to share thank you well thanks for sharing and for sure it looks like you have uh lived up to uh your own advice of Excellence confidence and humility and a big thanks for being here today well thank you very much thank you
