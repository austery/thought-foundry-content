so one of the key ideas here is that when you start to accept that you have profound influence on the world but very limited control you start to see the world differently you start to behave differently and you start to accept the limits of what you can and cannot do so when we imagine that everything happens for a reason it causes us to make cognitive mistakes and it also causes us to inscribe ideas behind the events of Our Lives that are fundamentally wrong does everything happen for a reason throughout our lives we are told that we're in control of our path through life that we have this idea of We're the main character and as long as we sort of make wise decisions then everything will turn out all right and when things don't turn out all right the saying that we always hear is that everything happens for a reason now both of those things are untrue it is not true that we're in control and in fact I think one of the key arguments in fluke is that we control nothing but we influence everything and also at the same time this illusion of control that we have and the stitching together of this clear narrative where everything has a reason behind it causes us to misunderstand the world and make mistakes a lot of things just happen and when you look at the causal chain of events that produce outcomes it is not neat and tidy it's messy we're told to ignore the noise and focus on the signal it's a huge mistake the noise is where many of the most important and consequential events in life take place so one of the key ideas here is that when you start to accept that you have profound influence on the world but very limited control you start to see the world differently you start to behave differently and you start to accept the limits of what you can and cannot do so when we imagine that everything happens for a reason it causes us to make cognitive mistakes and it also causes us to inscribe ideas behind the events of Our Lives that are fundamentally wrong and so the scientific evidence shows us that everything does not happen for a reason and therefore you need to have a philosophical change in how you think about the world if some things just happen arbitrarily randomly or as the byproduct of chaos theory that create the puppets that we all are of random events so the history of ideas in the world in my view is basically a history of trying to cram the complexity and messiness of the world into a really neat and tidy story for why things happen and this is partly derived from religion where people wanted to have Elegant order from God right the idea that there's a sort of accidental nature to reality is completely at odds with the notion that everything is planned by a higher being so throughout religious history there's always this neat and tidy story The everything happens for a reason aspect that's tied to the Divine now then as science unfolded and the Scientific Revolution uh you know developed and so on you have another shift it's not necessarily that it's it's all about God it's all about these sort of clockwork models of physics and they're very very elegant right and this is the kind of stuff where you have to eliminate the noise you have to eliminate the accidents because everything is supposed to be an equation that is really beautiful whether it's Adam Smith talking about you know the hand that guides our economies or the ways that Isaac Newton presented change and these unbelievably powerful equations to explain the world we have always tried to find the explanation that fits everything into an explanation that seems ordered and now this is why I think there's so much resistance to this notion of contingent convergence because it is irrational sometimes you know the fact that I can look at my own life and and understand that I'm the byproduct of a mass murder or that hundreds of thousands of people will die in one city because of a random vacation a couple took 19 years earlier these things are not neat and tidy they're not ordered they're not elegant but they're true and I think one of the things about science is that a lot of really strange things exist and it's better for us to just accept them and sort of stare into the face of this uncertainty this complexity and this Randomness than to Simply pretend it doesn't work this way because it's somehow comforting to our pattern obsessed brains and so you know when you look at the intellectual history of the world the randomness has systematically been written out and I think it's a mistake when we try to understand why stuff has happened to us in our lives our brains have evolved to make sense of patterns and that's because it's advantageous to survive to overd detect patterns so if you can imagine that you're a prehistoric hunter gatherer and you see a little bit of rustling in the grass or you hear a sound now maybe there's nothing there or maybe there's a saber-tooth tiger that's waiting to eat you now if you imagine there's nothing there and it turns out to be a saber-tooth tiger you die but if you over interpret the pattern and you say okay I think that might be something that I need to watch out for even if there's nothing there then you'll still survive so through survival of the fittest and evolu patterns our brains are hyper attuned to pattern detection now this means that when random or seemingly random things happen to us we're allergic to the explanation that it was just arbitrary and so we stitch together a neat and tidy story from A to B now that's a problem because when stuff happens to you that you don't have control over and you ascribe the sort of intentionality to it you've misar the lesson right and I think one of the things that's also very striking is that we understand this when we think about past but we don't understand this when we think about the present so when we watch Sci-Fi films for example that imagine time travel the warning that is always issued which people fundamentally accept is you shouldn't touch anything you shouldn't talk to anyone because you might accidentally delete yourself from the future or fundamentally change the patterns that you will then go back to when you return to your present time so don't squish a bug don't talk to the wrong person the problem is that when we think in the present we never think that way we never imagine that if we squish a bug or if we talk to someone we're reshaping the future but of course cause and effect patterns don't change whether they're in the past or the present they operate the same all the time and so I think the mentality we have towards the past is the correct one that we are constantly reshaping the future that what we do is important and that idea is something that I think we are also somewhat allergic to because it's so overwhelming to imagine that every single act that we has has unforeseen Ripple effects that will change the world and reshape our futures if is bewildering but it's also true and one of the things that I think happens when you look closely at the nature of causality reality and existence is that things that are bewildering are happening all the time and we just ignore them and I think when you peer into them you start to see a very different world and one that can be more fulfilling if you actually accept that some things don't happen for a reason and in fact that we have a life and a society that is diverted by Chaos Theory Western modernity has an obsession with what call the delusion of individualism and it is comforting to a lot of people to think that they're in control of their own lives so that they are the ones who are driving change and that it's not really up to other people that your life unfolds the way you want it to or if you're a politician that you can control the way the economy is going to work out or the way the election is going to turn out now the problem with this of course is that there's a lot of different ways about thinking of the world and one of them is Eastern philosophy which thinks a lot more about the intersections between people and the relational idea of how we're all connected now I think this is scientific fact I think we are all connected and we pretend otherwise and there's a story that's sort of a a strange story that I I saw in the in the Press while I was researching fluke about a person who went swimming off the coast of Greece a man named Ivan and Ivan goes out into the sea and he's not the best swimmer and a Riptide basically sucks him out into the ocean now his friends are pretty upset about this because he disappears from sight and they can't find him and there's about 24 hours where Ivan is missing at Sea and we all know how these stories turn out when someone is missing at sea for 24 hours except for in this story right as Ivan is about to slip beneath the waves and drown he spots a soccer ball bobbing on the surface of the ocean now that's already extraordinary enough you have this moment where he just is saved by this passing soccer ball that's floating and he clings to it and is eventually rescued but the more extraordinary part of the story is that when this uh news made the Greek television you know reports there was a woman who was watching the news and I sort of imagined her you know dropping her cup of coffee or whatever as they see the soccer ball on on the screen because she recognized the ball and she knew that her children had been playing with that exact same ball and had accidentally kicked it off a cliff 80 miles away from where Ivan eventually intersected with the trajectory of that ball bobbing on the sea 10 days later and the point is that you know the kids would look at this and they would think oh no we kicked the ball off the cliff let's buy another ball they would have no idea but it turned out that that kick is what saved the life of another person who was about to drown now when you think that way it's extremely obvious that there's an interconnection between those lives the problem is that there's not some magic that Ian had it's that everybody is actually unfolding in this way where we're constantly being affected by the actions of people we will never see and never meet and the extremely obvious way that we can understand this as well is the pandemic from the Corona virus outbreak in in 2020 where you have a single person get infected with a virus in Wuhan China and the lives of 8 billion people change for many many years and the trajectories of our lives are irrevocably changed all of us are different because of this pandemic and it's from one virus infecting one person potentially thousands of miles away from where you live and everything in the world became different so this is the the nature of reality and I think it's something that's a coping mechanism effectively for us to just ignore the science ignore the physics and imagine that we are in charge and this is where that saying that I come back to throughout fluke arises which is we control nothing but we influence everything and for Ivan and the soccer ball the influence that he experienced was from a couple of kids he will never have met uh who saved his life want to support the channel join the big think members Community where you get access to videos
