thank you everyone and welcome to this uh Coffee Talk uh today we are going to run you through our four strategic goals uh when it comes to communication what we have done to uh achieve them but we're just going to dive straight into it we have translated the strategy plan that you find out there into four key targets so these are our four targets that we worked with against as a communication department and as a overall organization the first one is about internal communication uh it's about boosting performance through effective internal communication we need good information sharing so that we know what other people are doing and Damon will talk more about that today the second goal we have is to increase knowledge and Trust about the fun among key stakeholders in Norway we are a public fund uh over one main client that is the Norwegian people and that is the client we need to communicate with then the third goal is to position the fund as a preferred employer among students and young professional and that goal we did not have uh in previous years uh is something we have worked a lot uh towards to achieve both to get the best employees in here but also to increase the knowledge among younger stakeholders which we see have in general low lower knowledge about finance and about the fund and then uh over four goal is about markets out there it's about strengthening understanding of the funds roles as a financial and responsible investor abroad we will talk about which key markets we uh operate in and uh talk to and how we focus uh in here and it's maybe more important than ever that how we operate and what we're doing is understood in the market and then they understand that we are a financial investor but we need to be operate in a responsible manner uh so boosting performance through effective internal communication might sound like a bit of a stretch to some of you but there's loads of uh research out there showing that companies that communicate well have better performance higher engagement lower turnover uh execute project better and just about every other indicator you can think of so how do we do that we're trying to we're trying to find a balance between uh face-to-face communication our digital tools and our events so whenever we you know we have a few new ideas and so on but we always try to come back to this balance because we think it's sort of the best way to build trust um build connections um and get communication flowing quickly and all those things rely on you so we see nbim employees at the center of the strategy and that's really because when you think about our Workforce right Highly Educated people um all online and dispersed across uh several offices probably the least efficient thing you could do is put someone in head office and get them to put all the news out on behalf of the rest of the organization so a much more efficient way to do that is for us to enable you to give you the tools and the structure to coach and whatever is needed um just point people in the right direction but you are the ones that are best at communicating your message and you know what we've been on this journey for like two years and I think you know the way people have responded here is really amazing um seeing so many of you getting involved in uh speaking on the uh the Monday meeting setting up coffee talks uh posting stuff on Yama uh and all sorts so uh from email and you know when you think so if you think about like closed and open uh say platforms you've got email and teams which work really well for us but they're closed so what we want to do is go more towards open platforms like yamma Monday meeting even the Monday meeting chat some something where everyone has the opportunity to to uh see and respond so I've just got a couple of examples for you of kind of why we want that and why something like yemma is better than email for for the kind of messages that we want everyone to be able to see so Marius went to the biggest AI what is it uh responsible AI conference in the world in Brazil right and he could have sent that as an email to who is it Oscar uh Sig good the few people that he tagged there but then it sort of it stays between those four people right so he put it out and then Lydia who he didn't know responded they kind of realized that oh they had something in common here something to discuss and they set up a meeting and they've been meeting ever since then uh to discuss responsible Ai and governance and and so on so much better as a post Daniel could have sent this you know in a teams chat to 12 PMS or something like that uh to his team or even to all of eqs but by putting it out there then we got to hear the response from active ownership and this is like you know really key stuff to the future of nbim Future Finance really important discussions and same thing with B right and this is like such an easy win when PMS go away and we've seen them doing more of this instead of putting it on tamale notes or sharing it with their team if you go away on a field trip and you learn a lot of stuff like share it with everyone and just put it out there and then you know you'll see that some people that uh you didn't even know were interested are interested and will react to it great Damon um so then the next goal we are working towards is then uh towards the key stakeholders in Norway to increase knowledge and trust and what we see from we you measure our reputational and Bal basis is that those uh who know more about us have bigger trust in what we do and in that way uh that is super important for us uh as a a public uh fund so our strategy is to be transparent and to build knowledge that is the key to this uh strategy and our overall communication goal is to be the most transparent Fund in the world and when we first set had that goal we had no way of measuring it it was kind of like a fluffy Direction This is the direction we want to go overall we want to be transparent but then um Sam benchmarking came out with a new Benchmark they Benchmark cost and performance for fun for years they started a benchmarking transparency and we were not number one but really wanted to win this uh otherwise we wouldn't be the world's most transparent Fone so we put down a group uh from Cross teams across MIM a lot of you uh participated there and we truly appreciate it and then for the first time last year we became number one and we are the world's most transparent fund and it's measured across four uh categories and it's done in a way that you need to find this information uh in an easy way at our web page then we did uh quite well across all the four categories uh but we were pretty sure that it was going to be even harder this year and the question we asked ourself can we push ourself even further we had a lot of good discussions in the leader group at different departments uh in the fund and I guess the answer was yes we can push ourselves even further because this year we got 100 in all the categories so we are fully transparent on all the parameters that some are benchmarking this 75 large fund across uh the ball but I think for me the cool thing here is is not only are we even more transparent but when we look at the 10 largest investment fund they all improved quite a lot over the last two years so I guess a bit of a healthy competition uh is good because it has increased transparency uh across uh the board then Lena over to our approach to media in Norway yes so media is of course a very important channel to reach are stakeholders in Norway uh and we have three sort of main pillars uh to how we work with media first of all it's just handling all the incoming requests we we get a lot of requests every day from all over the world and it's h it's a massive job just responding to everything and we have a 24hour response policy we try to answer everything within 24 hours uh that's also in our interest because uh deadlines uh are no longer fixed to when the paper newspaper come out as a used to be now it's on web and it's constant so if we are delayed in responding uh the journalists will often just publish a story anyway and we come off uh worse than if we had a comment on so that's why sometime when we reach out to you we give you really short deadlines but just that's just because we are under uh time pressure to really responding uh quickly just a very quick examples of a proactive initiative uh Karina has a column in e24 where she writes about the ownership topics has been really successful a great way to get uh knowledge out of how we work on ownership uh then we have uh gather some data from retri who an external media monitoring firm uh just to see how much we are mentioned out there where are we mentioned is it positive negative so we have a lot of data I'm just going to give you some highlights now this is how much we're mentioned in a reg media from 2019 up until August uh this year uh we see a peak in 2020 related to a certain hiring process uh but other than that it's pretty stable uh every year then over to external relations uh as I said we will come back to several times the key to this strategy is you the employees in uh a few years back now only three years back we scrapped our guideline on speaking engagement then you had to have Chief approval line managers approval and communication approval and there was a lot of things you could not talk about we try to change that into we encourage more people to get uh on a stage and you only need your line manager approval and get it into the system so uh we have now 180 employees who have completed presentation skills uh training then we have created this internal presentation hub for all employees because of course we need to do this in a efficient way we cannot talk to each and every one of you every day but on this platform you can find of course the corporate presentation but also quite a lot of good examples and we will continue to evolve that and build it out with other people presenting a good presentation that we think uh we sharing with the rest of you so we had a strategy to increase uh to get more people uh out on stages uh because we are all ambassadors for the fund we can share knowledge we are experts within our areas and it's a good way to to sh yeah to to to get more knowledge out there about uh the fund in 2021 which was of course year with still covid the picture looked like that this uh where CEO Nikolai uh presented approximately half the events that we were at now in 2024 it's a completely different pictures and when I show this to uh other organizations I see that we stand out because we now have a lot of spokes people out there and uh different stages and different are UNS and that means that we have a more robust strategy uh going forward we have more people that uh can share the knowledge and be at that stage we want to be a preferred employer in general uh but we think we're pretty much good on that for more more experience but we realized a few years ago that we want to do a push on students and young professionals so what do we do well we have three more than three have at least three tools that we're going to that we want to uh to share with you today the first one is actually visiting where these people are going out to universities but also inviting them to us the second one is the podcast and the third one is uh social media but let's start with uh the first thing University visits and NBI teach I love talking to students that was probably one of the first thing I heard from Nikolai and he really did uh Nikolai spent a lot of time in the beginning uh of his uh of his tenure here uh going out to universities both in Norway and abroad but especially in Norway and we did it a lot the first years and as the chart you just saw by Marta it looks a little bit similar right uh Nikolai in 2001 67% of all with of all the the visits we did and was quite a lot here we has we have done uh change as well we want more people to be out there we have a lot of people who could go back to visit their own schools uh and talk about the fun and this is what it looks like and this is both visiting universities just to talk about the fun but it's is also what we're going to what I'm going to touch upon now NB teach and what is that n teach I mean there's been people in the fun going out to schools talking about the fund and what we do for a long time but MBI teach was launched as an initiative uh a few years ago uh and in the beginning we had a web page where schools could come to us and sort of order your own expert after a while we realized that we should just turn that around the second thing is the podcast I mean the podcast wasn't tailor made for recruitment right it was made for something something else uh but it has grown so big that that is one of the effects we get out of it uh and it attracts young people as well 40% of our listeners are between 18 and 35 so uh quite a lot of the people who uh apply for jobs or Su internships here uh actually caught us sort of by the by the podcast and start to get interested that's great uh now we scroll 90 met per day that's what meta says that's about as tall as the ATC Tower at Oto airport every single day I mean no wor there there's a reason why you hav't s them I think in social media you it it really is about going into the niche especially with the young crowd they are they use the YouTube things instead of using Google they Tik Tok things to know how to make food they literally use social media for everything now we can tap into that where we can bring value we don't want to use social media just as a outgoing platform we want to use it as a two-way Communication channel where we can really bring value to people at the other end and that's what we've done especially this year with the summer interns takeover where that's the most productive holiday I've ever had because that was actually a record-breaking summer where we had some of the best post post or the best post that we've actually had ever at NB and we've now over the course of the last months also have rolled up the Takeover effect into other areas um what we see is that we tend to get the most engagement that we've ever had in that type of area where we have these types of takeovers so what we really want to do uh going forward is for us to tap into the Takeover space with even more people in the fund because we see that it has an actual true effect now it's all about who you put in front of the screen and when you want to reach younger Target audence groups we really want to have uh someone they can relate to they want to Envision themselves into working at MB so that's especially important for the interns and the graduates why we really want to push them outwards as well now it's not all coincidential we actually see a big increase now especially this is from Norway but that's also General uh across the board uh we see a lot of young people coming into LinkedIn Nikolai obviously staying ahead of the curve uh by couple of years actually um however we don't really see that MB effect uh going into uh the followers that we have so we still have some way to go and that's why we really want you guys to to help us in order to actually bring uh even more people out there uh for us to Showcase now on Instagram we predominantly reach uh Norwegian so about 50% of the reach is Norwegian but we also especially see that that's the youngest Target groups of the different three main different channels we have which is LinkedIn YouTube and Instagram now over to YouTube that's uh where we have actually just 5% uh of the viewership in Norway uh which is quite interesting 95% International viewers which is uh great we also see of course a um a podcast effect there but what we really want to tap into now is that we can leverage that into having them view other things than just the podcast as well social media is now um that has been a recent development for the fund not however not really that new uh for social media in general but we now see that media and social media is super linked it also means that in the strategy 25 we have um set out that we want to use social media for two-way communication and we see that social media is really the way that that works we have great engagements and we have uh great questions about uh our investments as well so I I highly appreciate when you are available for when I have uh questions coming in because uh we see now social media is really also a way to kind of have a good media response as well uh that actually gives us some new opportunities so uh what we want to do now further is just really taking MBI I IM teach and all the uh great speaking engagements that we have and just leverage that in a totally new different way where we can make a digital impact as well as the physical one so we instead of reaching just 50 people you can reach 500 people or 5,000 5 million you know there's so much in here and that's uh some untap potential that we really want to highlight in the uh going forward this is core right this is very core of what we do so how can we use Communications to uh enhance that work okay the podcast uh started out as something and you know when a snowball starts to roll uh you don't really know what how big it's going to be and that's what happened with this and at the point we started in and thought that it was going to be only no region listening listening to it but at some point uh we uh started to concure the world so um by now it's like it's 6.3 million downloads in total then you think most of it is in Norway but it's not uh it's only 1.7 of them inside this country so it has really gone Global and it's always interesting to see what happened here Bill Gates happened and here Sam mman happened what happened here Elon Musk happened and also the investment conference but as you can see uh we really really gone through the roof in the US uh which is kind of which is interesting and no one could really have anticipated it
