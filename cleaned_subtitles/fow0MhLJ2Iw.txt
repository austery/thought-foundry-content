2024 Statistical Survey
Taiwan’s fertility rate ranks last in the world
Fertility rate for every Taiwanese woman in 2024
Taiwan has 1.11 people
Taiwan’s fertility rate is so low
It can be said that it surpasses Japan and catches up with South Korea.
Not only the Asian crane tail
In the world, we are also here to accompany you
More and more young people are not getting married and having children.
In fact, the trend of not having children has been around since ancient times.
The book I’m going to face today is “Isn’t it better not to be born?” 》
Let’s talk about the “anti-natalism” philosophy that has been very popular in recent years.
The author of this book, Masahiro Morioka, is a philosopher at Waseda University
In today’s video we will introduce
Anti-birth versus birth-affirming philosophies
First, let’s define what anti-natalism is
This refers to: comparing a person who was born in the world with someone who was not born.
Think it would be better not to have been born
It is ethically wrong to be born
We generally think
Ancient people usually liked to have children when they had nothing to do.
In ancient times, the idea of ​​having many children and grandchildren was held
But in fact, as early as ancient Greece, there was an anti-birth trend of thought.
In the myth of Oedipus
As soon as Oedipus was born, his father received an oracle that said this son would kill his father and marry his mother.
So the father ordered his slaves to kill Oedipus
But the slave saved his life
Send him to another country as an adopted son
When Oedipus grows up
He actually killed his father without knowing it
Finally, he returned to China and married his mother
After Oedipus learned that the prophecy came true,
Blind your own eyes
Lamenting why he was born
At this time, the chorus behind him sang his mood:
The best thing in the world is not to be born
And those who have been born into the world
The best option is to die quickly
This idea that it would be better not to be born
In fact, it was widely spread in ancient Greece
Japanese biblical scholar Masao Sekine believes that
This has even spread to the Middle East
Ecclesiastes, which influenced the Old Testament
The Book of Ecclesiastes mentions:
“I praise him who is long dead more than he who is alive.
And those who have never been born are stronger than the first two. ” (4:2)
Because people who have never come to the world
No need to experience the meaninglessness of life
No need to waste time walking this way
So Ecclesiastes says:
“A stillborn baby will enjoy more rest than a person who lives to a hundred years” (6:3-5)
If it wasn't a stillbirth,
But what about the people who were successfully born?
If these people want to get rid of the meaninglessness of life,
You must believe in God
So the emergence of Judaism
In fact, it can be seen as a response to the anti-birth trend that was prevalent at the time.
Because anti-birth ideas are so popular
Everyone who is alive feels world-weary
The emergence of Judaism provides people with a reason to live
Make people feel that life has sacred meaning
Anti-birtherism continued to influence the 2nd century AD
A sect called "Gnosticism" emerged in the Middle East
Believes that people are misled and fall into this sinful world
So birth was a mistake
After death, people will return to a good world
And in the East
Same period as ancient Greek philosophy
Anti-birth ideas also emerged
In the sixth century BC, ancient India recorded in the "Upanishads"
People who know reincarnation have the opportunity to enter the Brahma world after death
Can transcend reincarnation and never be born again
But those who don’t believe in reincarnation
Will be metabolized by nature after death
Become whole grains
If these grains are eaten by men,
will turn into semen
After fertilization, a person will be reincarnated into the world
This idea of ​​reincarnation later influenced Buddha
Developed Buddhist anti-natalism
Think life is full of pain
After death, he will be reincarnated into the world
experience pain again
can never get rid of
The best thing people can do
It’s transcending reincarnation
Don't come to this world again
This requires daily practice to eliminate pain
First, we need to observe what is causing the pain.
Buddhism believes that suffering comes from unfulfilled desires
No matter how good life is
Eventually they will all grow old and die.
Because the human body is subject to corruption
The body is like a stinky skin
Birth, aging, illness and death are the prototypes of human suffering experience
Another source of suffering is that everything changes rapidly
All good things must fade away
But people will cling to the good things of the past
For example, you think your lover has changed
Not like before
But actually
There is no eternal self
Buddhism even further advocates
Don't fall in love with anyone
Because when you have a lover
You will suffer when you can’t see your lover
And the deeper the love
The more painful it is when parting
People who have children will have worries in this world
Therefore, the Dhammapada says: "Without love and hatred, there is no bondage."
But how is it possible not to love someone?
This problem can be solved by becoming a monk
So give up the family and deny having children
It is the process of eliminating self-grasping and eliminating desires.
This is the only way to reach nirvana
Although Buddhism advocates not being attached to life,
But I don’t support suicide
Because suicide is still the attachment to death
And it is an act of active killing.
Violated Doctrine
Buddhism advocates peaceful practice
waiting for death to come
It is a Buddhist state
And it's not melancholy or escapism
On the contrary, it is a deep joy
For example, in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra
It records the scene before the death of Buddha when he was 80 years old.
Buddha said that everything he saw was filled with joy
Joy also means lovely in the original Pali text.
So the anti-birth attitude of Buddhism is
No attachment to the world, just looking at the world calmly
I think the world is really cute
There is an important difference between Buddhism and Western anti-natalism
Anti-birthism in the West says I wish I had never been born
I sigh because I have been born
It means that this wish will never come true
But Buddhism says I wish I wasn’t born
This wish is possible
Because Buddhism has the concept of afterlife
There is a spiritual system to practice anti-birth
As long as you practice according to Buddhism, you can transcend reincarnation
So denying birth is not denying this life
but to deny future births
This leads to an interesting conclusion
To be able to deny birth
We must first affirm the birth
Because Buddhism believes
Only life reincarnated into the human world
Only then can we have the opportunity to practice and achieve Nirvana
If you are reborn in hell
There is no such opportunity
So I can come to the human world
It's actually a very lucky thing
As long as you seize the opportunity to practice well
Maybe you don’t have to suffer reincarnation again
in western thought
You were either definitely born
Either deny birth
These two positions are opposite
But in Buddhism
These two opposing ideas can be tolerated together
Reviewing the Anti-birth Thoughts in Ancient East and West
we will find
"I wish I had never been born" is actually a sigh that everyone, regardless of high or low, will have.
It’s not just the poor and the losers who object to birth
Like Oedipus, the author of the Bible, Gautama Buddha
These people are ancient philosophers and royal families
Even these people would be against birth
Representing that anti-natalism is not just the sigh of the people at the bottom
This completes the introduction of anti-birth thoughts in ancient times in the East and West
Next we will introduce
Anti-birth philosopher who blended Eastern and Western thought: Schopenhauer
Schopenhauer absorbed the ideas of ancient India and Buddhism
Wrote the masterpiece "The World as Will and Representation"
This book inspired many later anti-natalist philosophers
Schopenhauer believes
Each individual does not exist before birth
It’s all just nothing
Birth is equal to receiving the gift of life
from nothing to something
But after death, it will return to nothingness
So life is about making something out of nothing
Finally returned to nothingness
What kind of power makes life emerge from a state of nothingness?
This force was called "will" by Schopenhauer
Unlike the philosophers of the past,
Schopenhauer believed that will was not limited to humans
Everything has an active force that allows it to grow and continue
Like the power of plant and animal growth, the formation of crystals
These are driven by the will of nature
But no matter how all things in nature develop,
In the end, there is no way to escape the fate of death
So life has developed a way to overcome death
It's about giving birth
Pass your life to the next generation
This will keep the will to live alive
This explains why animals have sexual desires
Because individuals will die one day
In order to preserve the species as a whole
The will to life drives individuals to have sexual behaviors
So the will actually does not belong to the individual
but belongs to the entire species
It’s not “I have the will to live, I have a sexual desire.”
Rather, "the will to live possesses humans, and sexual desire dominates humans."
<font color=#FFF300FF>Reasons for surviving life</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>It’s because of the trait of reproduction</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>Life constantly changes its shape and appearance in order to reproduce</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>To adapt to various environments</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>We are what we are today</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>In other words</font>
<font color=#FFF300FF>The purpose of survival is reproduction</font>
Human beings are beings toyed with by the will to survive.
Each individual is blindly driven by sexual desire to reproduce
like ants
It doesn't matter if one of them is trampled to death.
The entire ant community will be driven by will
To complete the mission of this species
But Schopenhauer said
When a person is driven by sexual desire to have sexual impulses
Although it will bring temporary pleasure
but after orgasm
Men will feel a sense of sadness and disgust
That is to say, entering saint mode
Schopenhauer thought this was like a portrayal of life:
Repeated pursuit of pleasure only ends up in pain
Even if a person achieves a certain goal
Will pursue bigger goals again
You will definitely feel pain when pursuing
And no matter how much success you pursue
Everyone will die eventually
like a bubble
No matter how loud you blow
It will all break eventually
So Schopenhauer said: The essence of all life is pain
This is "the sin of existence itself"
In this case
It would be better if humans never existed
It's not just that suffering individuals shouldn't exist
But the entire species of life should not exist
Here comes the problem
What do those of us who have been born do?
Schopenhauer said that human beings must use their cognitive abilities to achieve a state of "willlessness"
That is, having no desires or desires
indifferent to everything
When you have no attachment to the world
can be freed from the pain of the world
Gain the joy of freedom and peace
Such a person is like a mirror
Just reflects the appearance of the world
without being disturbed by the world
This idea of ​​eliminating desire and gaining liberation
It is inspired by Buddhism and Hinduism
Like the ascetics in India who give up all desire for survival
According to Schopenhauer, this is an example of moving toward "willlessness"
So Schopenhauer is not only against birth, but also against human sexuality
If everyone abstains from sex
The natural result is
No more new life will be born in the world
Humanity will eventually slowly become extinct
This sounds like a very pessimistic philosophy
But in Schopenhauer's view
On the contrary, it is a victory of mankind against the will to survive.
<font color=#FFEF00FF>
I think the honorable thing for our species to do is deny our programming, < font color=#FFEF00FF> /font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>stop reproducing, walk hand in hand
into extinction. </font> <font color=#FFEF00FF>stop reproducing, walk hand in hand into extinction. </font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>
So what's the point of getting out of bed in the morning?</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>I tell myself I bear witness</font> <font color=#FFEF00FF>I tell myself i bear witness
</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>But actually I was just designed to be like this</font> <font color=#FFEF00FF>
the real answer is that it's obviously my programming.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>And I lack
the constitution for suicide.</font>
However, although Schopenhauer supported sterilization, he did not support suicide.
Because the person who commits suicide is fighting against life
Rather than the will to survive
Suicide just because of dissatisfaction with living conditions
Not because he really objects to living
in other words
People who commit suicide actually long for a better life
He commits suicide only when his life is unsatisfactory
But Schopenhauer believes
What should be cut off is this desire for a "good life"
Because I want a good life
It represents the will controlling human beings behind the scenes.
So Schopenhauer would say to someone who wants to commit suicide:
you don't really want to end your life
But want to end the pain
In fact, there is no need to commit suicide
Because your pain comes from you still having desires
So what needs to be eliminated is this desire
Instead of eliminating those who have desires
Now we are going to move into contemporary philosophy
An introduction to today's leading anti-natalist philosophers
David Benatar
His works also have Chinese translations in Taiwan
It's called "How hard it is to be a human being"
Benetta's theory is called birth injury theory
He believes that being born in this world will always bring harm
It has nothing to do with one’s subjective feelings
If someone thinks that living is a beautiful thing
That means they made a mistake
I haven’t thought about the issue of birth carefully.
Benetta starts from a premise:
"Feeling pain is a bad thing, feeling happiness is a good thing"
Now we imagine two scenarios
when people exist
There must be pain
There is also pleasure
That is to say, there are good things and bad things in life.
But if a person has never been born
There will be no pain
But there is no chance to feel happiness
But now Benetta says
No chance to feel happiness
It's not a bad thing
But it was painful to be born
Must be a bad thing
There is an asymmetry between the two
Think about it if there was a baby with a rare disease
Giving birth to him will make him suffer for the rest of his life
We will feel that this has ethical issues
The parents who gave birth to him must bear ethical responsibility
But if it's a baby destined to be happy
Parents suddenly decided not to have children
We don’t think these parents are evil either.
in other words
The logic of pain cannot be applied to happiness
This is similar to saying
If we saw a man on Mars
Enjoy the beautiful scenery on Mars
We will feel that this person is so happy
But if there were no people on Mars
You wouldn't say this is too immoral, would you?
There's no one up there
The same principle can be proved
Life cannot come to this world to experience happiness
not a bad thing
Parents have no obligation to give birth to children
But if life comes to the world, it will suffer
That must be a bad thing
Parents have the obligation not to give birth to their children
So it is better not to be born than to be born
In this case
It would actually be more legitimate not to have children.
Those who want to have children
More arguments should be presented to rationalize their behavior
Think about it
If you have a baby in Taiwan
I have been tortured by the education system since I was a child.
Worry about being hit by a car every day
When you grow up, you have to accept low wages
In this social environment
People who still want to have children are special, right?
These people should come out and explain
Why do you dare to have children in such an environment?
So in the future someone will ask you why you don’t have children
Just tell him Benetta's theory of birth harm.
In turn, I asked him to prove why he dared to have children.
We can further challenge Benetta's theory
Although you will experience pain after being born
But you can also experience many good things
But if you weren’t born, you wouldn’t be able to experience anything.
Wouldn't it be better to be born this way?
Benetta said it would be better not to be born than to be born.
We can think of life as a piece of fabric
Everyone can paint on a clean white cloth
You can make your life colorful
But no matter how beautiful you paint the cloth
Nothing can beat the original purity and flawlessness
And there must be many places where your painting is not perfect.
These stains will ruin the painting
Since being born is always worse than not being born
Benetta will finally come to a conclusion
All humans should be sterilized
Human extinction would be better for humanity
When ordinary people hear it, they may think
Does this person have any hatred of mankind?
But Benetta advises everyone not to have children because she loves human beings.
Because human beings are living beings with a sense of pain.
Every time a new life is born
Just one more person on earth will feel the pain
If people don’t have the perception of pain
Then Benetta will not object to the birth of humans
In the world that Benetta dreams of, there is no life that can feel pain.
So actually not only humans need to be sterilized
People still need to sterilize animals
After all animals become extinct
Humanity can become extinct
Otherwise, even if humans become extinct
In the world, there will still be predators of the weak and the strong in the animal kingdom.
There are still animals that feel pain
For example, Benetta is a vegetarian
Refuse to cause animals to feel pain
But even if humans and animals become extinct
Actually it's not enough
Because in the future, bacteria and insects may evolve into species that feel pain.
So humans need to invent a monitoring system
As long as it is detected that a species that can feel pain has evolved
We must eliminate them in time
Because it is the power of life evolution that allows pain to appear in the world
So Benetta’s anti-natalism
In fact, we are working against the power of life evolution.
<font color=#FFEF00FF>In my opinion, the existence of life... is an overrated phenomenon</font> <font color=#FFEF00FF>In my opinion, the existence of life... is a
highly overrated phenomenon.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Look around you</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Just look around you.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Mars gets along perfectly
well without so much as a microorganism.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>So tell me,</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>So tell me,</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>What else is needed to make this better, build a pipeline? </font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>how would all of this be greatly improved by an oil pipeline?</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Or a shopping mall? </font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>By a shopping mall? </font>
But although Benetta denies birth,
But it does not support people committing suicide
Because his theoretical premise is
Don't let life feel painful
If you commit suicide, you will not only bring harm to yourself
It will make the people who love you suffer even more
So suicide actually brings more pain into the world.
Even more immoral than having a baby
The only exception is that seriously ill patients may be worse off than dead
At this time, asking the patient to euthanasia will reduce the pain
We can use the analogy of watching a movie to illustrate Benetta’s theory of birth harm.
Birth is like your parents taking you to the cinema to watch a movie
You don’t realize until the movie starts that it’s a bad movie
You look painful
But your parents bought a ticket for you and let you in.
You just have to finish watching it.
Because if you see half of it and leave
It's like abandoning your parents
All you can do is stop dragging other people into watching this shitty movie
For Benetta
Life is a crappy movie
Although it is ugly
But we can't leave halfway
All we can do is not let new life enter this world
After introducing the anti-birth philosophy
Finally, we introduce the philosophy of affirming birth
The most important philosopher is Nietzsche
Nietzsche's philosophy is a criticism of Schopenhauer
So it can be seen as a philosophical debate between "affirming birth" and "anti-birth"
Nietzsche first discussed the topic of denying birth in "The Birth of Tragedy"
King Midas asked his attendant Silenus: What is the greatest good of mankind?
The attendant replied: The best thing for a human being is not to be born
The next best thing is to die quickly
This is the anti-birth trend that was prevalent in ancient Greece.
Later it also appeared in Schopenhauer's pessimistic philosophy
Nietzsche retorted:
Think non-existence is better than existence
The very idea is a disease, a decline
is a kind of nihilism
Nietzsche believed that human birth is an "innocence of becoming"
The universe is always being created
Life will continue to give birth to the next generation
Your parents gave birth to you
There is no question of good or evil here
Just like water spontaneously evaporates into water vapor
We cannot say that this generation is evil
The opposite of
Nietzsche advocated a life-affirming philosophy
Nietzsche said: Never wish to exist in a way different from reality
No matter in the past or in the future, never
That is to say
Don't think about it all day long:
It would have been better if I hadn't been born
This anti-birth attitude
Just escaping reality
Just like Christians fantasizing about a better life after death
Nietzsche proposed a thought experiment to affirm the existence of this world
called eternal return
We can imagine that the passage of time has no end and is infinite
However, the matter and energy in the universe are limited
This means that after all possible events have occurred
The universe will definitely repeat what happened in the past
in other words
The state of things that exists now has happened before
It's just that we mistakenly thought this was the first time it happened
So when we do anything
If you are sure in your heart, you can immediately say: That’s exactly it! This is what I want!
Affirmation of the present is actually an eternal affirmation
because of what's happening now
This has happened countless times in the past universe.
You may ask
Imagine that what you have done has been repeated countless times
Isn't that boring?
It should be unique because it can only be experienced once in life.
Nietzsche believes that eternal return will not make life lose its uniqueness
On the contrary, it will be more dazzling because of it
Because when you take action
You must think about:
It doesn’t matter if this kind of life repeats itself an infinite number of times
Then you will definitely take the action that is most meaningful to you
So the philosopher Karl Löwith summarized Nietzsche's eternal return as:
"One must live in such a way that one longs to repeat every moment."
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Even though you break my heart over and over again</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>I want to tell you</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>If there is an afterlife</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>I will still choose to file taxes with you</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Open a laundry</font>
What I am willing to do is what I am willing to do repeatedly.
Then Nietzsche said:
"When you affirm one joy, you also affirm all pain."
Happiness and pain are interdependent
Man cannot come into the world after
Just want the happiness in the world and exclude all the pain
Because everything in the world is interconnected
For example, if you want to be born
The premise is that your parents want to meet
Then your parents' parents will also meet
Keep tracing back
It can be traced back to the immigration of Han people to Taiwan
The stories behind these immigrants are full of suffering
Like Japanese colonization
World War II
February 28 Incident
So when you affirm your wonderful life
In fact, it also affirms the suffering of our ancestors.
in other words
Eternal Return is not just about good things happening again
But all the suffering in human history will happen again
Anti-natalists would counter that
I am against having children because there is too much suffering in the world
How is it possible that human suffering should be repeated indefinitely?
Nietzsche would respond:
There is a basis behind the eternal return
It's called Amor fati
No matter how miserable life is
We all need to love this world
Longing for this world to be repeated countless times
why
Because if eternal return exists
Then everything that happens in life has already happened.
That is to say, everything is inevitable by fate.
This inevitability does not make us feel powerless
On the contrary, it makes us feel
Everything is arranged in the dark
Like every piece of a puzzle is indispensable
Nietzsche used the term "love destiny"
A bit like the love a parent has for a child
What will the child look like after birth?
Are there any rare diseases?
It's determined by fate
Parents will not blame their children for their defects
Don’t love your own children
I won't complain about this
How wonderful it would be if I hadn't given birth to this child
<font color=#FFEF00FF>so what?
</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Do you not care about everything else? </font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>you just gonna ignore everything else?</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>You can be anything anywhere.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>you could be anything anywhere.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Why not go to one</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>why not go somewhere where your...</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Your daughter is not just a place like this? </font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>where your daughter is more than just this</font>
If fate gives me a defective child
Then it is this defective child that I love
This is like the mother in the movie "Alien"
Obviously already know the result
We can see that children will die from diseases in the future
Still willing to give birth to a child?
Experience destiny again and again
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Despite knowing the journey and where it
leads,</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>I will still embrace it</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF> I embrace it.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>And I welcome every moment of it
.</font>
This is the meaning of Nietzsche's "fateful love" and "eternal return"
There are many flawed moments in life
As if determined by fate
But we should not deny ourselves and say, "I would rather not have been born."
Wait, isn't this kind of fateful love a bit like letting fate happen?
Do you feel a sense of destiny?
The author’s interpretation of Nietzsche is:
Destiny love is more like accepting the bad things that happened in the past
Because there is an inevitability behind the occurrence of these things
What happened, happened
Don't make strange things
Don't dwell on past mistakes
Such talents can welcome a new life and face the world
So the love of destiny is an affirmation of life
For example, no one wants war to happen
But looking back at human history
There are just a lot of wars
Destined love will ask us to recognize
This is the yesterday of mankind
But that doesn’t mean we can’t proactively intervene in the future
People can still take the initiative to create new history
Therefore, Nietzsche’s anti-birth thoughts are completely different from those of Schopenhauer and Benatar.
They all believe that no matter how happy life is
There is no way to avoid pain
Pain is the essence of life
So having children is immoral.
make life suffer
But for Nietzsche
Pain is nothing
That is just the common destiny of mankind
There is only one moment in life
Let yourself feel: It’s good to be alive
Then all the pain will be worth it.
<font color=#FFE900FF>The wind was very warm that day</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>I feel very comfortable just running</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>Watching the fallen leaves flying all over the sky</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>At that time I suddenly felt that for some reason</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>Maybe I want to race with them here</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>Just born in this world</font>
It's like a painter painting a picture
Even if 99% of life is painted in pitch black
As long as there is 1% bright spot
It can make 99% of the past look different in an instant
So Nietzsche affirmed that everyone should love the darkness in life
rather than being like those anti-natalists
Complaining all day long that it would have been better if I hadn't been born
Let's not have another generation
In Nietzsche's opinion, these remarks are the weak escaping from reality.
Dare not accept the challenge of fate
Failure to understand the truth of eternal return
Today's video
We profile anti-natalist thought over the past two thousand years
Oedipus in ancient Greece
Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament
Buddha in Ancient India
Schopenhauer's philosophy of will
Benetta's Birth Damage Theory
And Nietzsche’s eternal return and fateful love
Throughout the ages
All philosophers are looking for the meaning of life
Trying to answer which one is better, yes to birth or no to birth?
until today
Philosophers still don't have a final answer
But anti-natalism is beginning to be discussed again in today’s society
It reflects that there are too many sufferings in today’s society
The public has begun to think
Is having children harming the next generation?
Not getting married or having children may be a more moral choice
As long as this society makes people find it difficult to survive
Anti-birtherism will never disappear
