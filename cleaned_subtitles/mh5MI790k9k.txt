They're probably
the biggest innovations
in the treatment of depression
in seven decades.
And people get better,
they get better within one day.
♪
Hi, I'm Eric Bombicino
and today we're going to be
talking about Ketamine.
Now, Ketamine,
once known as a party drug,
is being used widely
to treat depression,
including Treatment
Resistant Depression.
Now that will be, I guess, our
villain for today's interview.
What is Treatment Resistant
Depression?
Why do depressions such as this
take such firm root in people?
And how is Ketamine being used
to treat it,
and how effective is it?
I want to welcome
Roger McIntyre.
Thank you for coming.
You are a Professor of
Psychiatry and Pharmacology
at University of Toronto.
You are the chairman
and exec director
of the Brain and Cognition
Discovery Foundation.
And you have about
48 other titles
that we will reveal later.
(Hearty chuckling) Yeah.
But thank you for coming.
Thanks for having me, Eric,
I'm looking forward to
our conversation.
All right, let's get into it.
Yeah.
So we're going to be
talking about Ketamine.
Yeah, you bet.
And using it for
Treatment Resistant Depression.
But we should probably
define our enemy.
Yeah.
I guess, our villain
of this interview
is going to be
Treatment Resistant Depression.
So, how do we define it?
I love the way you said
that it's a villain
because, in my view,
this is probably the
greatest scourge to humanity.
In fact, the literature
shows that's the case.
And, you know,
having depression's not just
a burden on the person living.
There's obviously a tremendous
cost for our society.
The FDA in the United States
has the definition
that's been most cited.
And that definition is
someone who has depression,
they have lived experience,
they have been taking
two or more antidepressants,
for an adequate dose,
an adequate duration of time,
and they've been taking it.
And if after two or more,
but minimum two, trials
they're still struggling,
the FDA says,
"We think you've got
Treatment Resistant Depression."
Right.
But the FDA is also
very quick to say
they recognize that
this definition
is not totally arbitrary
but it's not the only definition
that's out there.
And there are many aspects
to that definition
that fall short of ideal.
Should we change
the definition of it?
Should we rename
Treatment Resistant Depression
or rethink the term?
I think nothing speaks louder
than an example,
to answer your question.
Yeah, yeah.
I saw this gentleman and he
came up to me at my clinic,
this was just before
the pandemic,
and he came up to me
and he said,
"Can I speak with you
for a moment?" I said, "Sure."
He said, "I've been
struggling with depression
"for more than a decade."
He had listed many treatments
he'd been on
which were very
conventional approaches,
including electrical convulsive
therapy or shock therapy.
Okay, which we'll get to later.
And talk therapy.
And he came and he said, "I have
been told for over a decade
"I've got
Treatment Resistant Depression."
I said, "Okay."
"And I've come, I've been taking
treatment, I've had Ketamine,
"I'm much better,
I'm back to work."
He drives a truck.
"I'm driving a truck again."
I said,
"This is an amazing story,
"I'm really-- it's awesome
to hear this."
And I didn't know
where it was quite going.
He goes, "But can I ask you
a question?
"So I'm going to meet my doctor
next week."
I said, "Yeah."
"Do I still have
Treatment Resistant Depression?"
Right, yeah. (Chuckling)
I thought,
"What a great question."
And so, I don't think
it's ideal.
First of all,
Treatment Resistant Depression
has a sort of a defeatist
kind of sound to it,
it sounds like it's
the end of the line,
I mean,
"treatment resistant".
Second is that we don't know
if it's actually resistant.
Right.
In the sense that
there are many people
who've been told
they have this who get...
My gentleman was point in fact.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah!
And he was told
there was no hope for him.
Yeah, and label matters.
Labels matter.
Labels matter.
Yeah.
And then, thirdly, I think
there's probably among
many limitations of
that definition.
What if somebody, in fact, tried
another modality of therapy,
psychotherapy or something else,
and they got better?
Right.
So, the definition is
too medication centric
in that regard.
What should we change it to?
I think that
there's a phrase called
"difficult to treat
depression".
Okay.
I like it because, first of all,
I think it's non judgemental,
intentionally or
unintentionally.
I think it's kind of agnostic.
Yeah.
Second is I don't think it has
a valence of hopelessness
and defeatist.
Yeah.
It's difficult to treat.
I mean, let's face it,
some diabetic situations are
more difficult than others.
Some overweight situations,
some heart diseases are more
difficult to treat than others,
but we can treat you.
We don't know the future.
Some people can get better.
And some people get better
on some very innovative
new therapies.
So I think I like the phrase
"difficult to treat depression".
Yeah. Yeah, and I know
depression is a liar.
I like that phrase,
I like that phrase.
Depression can distort
your sense of hope.
I like that phrase.
So for someone who is leaving
a psychiatrist's office...
Yes.
..with the diagnosis of
Treatment Resistant Depression,
Yeah.
does that kind of lean into
the lie that depression tells?
That there might be
no hope for you?
Well, first of all,
I like what you just said
and I agree with that,
I want to amplify it.
Yeah.
I agree that
depression is a lie.
Yeah.
Because I think, in many cases,
it is not an infinite illness,
this is not a lifetime curse,
it can get better.
We can't predict the future.
I think it was Yogi Berra
who said,
"Predictions are difficult,
especially about the future."
Right.
The great philosopher
Yogi Berra.
He was. But in depression,
for me,
I've seen patients for
almost 30 years, Eric,
and with difficult to treat
depression and bipolar disorder
and they get better.
Right.
And I've had people say,
"You know, Dr. McIntyre,
"I've been told there's no hope
for me, I've tried everything,
"nothing works",
and so on, and so forth.
I would like to say
we found a solution
for every single person,
I'd like to tell you that,
and one day I hope
we can say that.
But what I can say is we find
a solution for a lot of people,
the great majority of people.
Perseverance
and keep pushing along
in just trying to
find that right match.
But you're right,
it is a lie.
And I think when people are told
they got
Treatment Resistant Depression
I can't imagine how
discouraging that sounds.
Right?
I think hope is critical.
And I think this is a big part
of why names and words matter.
That's why I like
"difficult to treat" better.
Yeah, and you've been at this
for, what, 30 years now?
Almost, yeah.
Those folks you've worked with,
with these...
Yeah.
And let's, we'll go with
Difficult to Treat Depression,
with these Difficult to Treat
Depressions...
Yeah.
..do you have a sense of
who's more likely to get better
and get over the wall
and who might not?
Do you have any...
any idea of that?
I don't.
How's that for an answer?
Okay, yeah.
So it still remains
a bit of a mystery.
It's a complete mystery.
Hm.
And I'd like to sit here
and say,
"Guess what, Eric,
we got it figured out.
"I can tell by
the colour of your shirt,
"I can tell by,
you know, this part."
A biomarker, yeah.
A biomarker, an MRI scan,
a blood test.
I can then make a determination,
maybe your sibling or
your parent or what have you.
Right.
Now, stay tuned.
The future will, I think,
get us over that wall.
The future will be about
this personalized,
very precise ways of
prognosticating
not only your illness
in the future,
but also what is
the right treatment
for your particular condition.
It remains aspirational
but it's not quixotic,
it's not some fantasy.
It's actually within grasp.
In the near term we don't.
Right.
And that's both the reason why
we have to remain so open-minded
and aspirational.
But frankly, it's also what
makes it very frustrating.
'Cause we don't, it's a bit of
a trial and error process.
And that's obviously not
something that's ideal.
So the mystery remains for now,
to a certain degree.
For now.
But let's...
let's spend some time here
before we talk about
Ketamine.
Yeah.
Try and unravel that mystery
just a little bit.
Yeah.
Um, so when it comes to these
difficult to treat depressions,
um, let's start with someone's
social economic background.
How does that factor in?
It's one of the major factors.
Okay.
So, I'm a psychiatrist
who has dedicated my career
to providing care in research
in depression and bipolar,
and I'm a pharmacologist.
So I'm looking at
new drug treatments.
Right.
And that recognizes there's
many ways to treat depression,
but that's my...
what I focus on.
And what I would say is
I tell audiences this
all over the world,
is that one of the
most robust determinants
of whether you end up with
difficult to treat depression,
and or whether the treatments
actually work,
is do you have
money in the bank.
So, precariousness
or insecurity...
Right.
..of finance, of housing,
of healthcare, of food,
it's hard for your treatments
to work,
it's hard to actually
be on cylinders
when you have all this
insecurity in your life.
ERIC:
Right.
Having security
is antidepressant,
it's resiliency enhancement.
Now, the other part is, and we
know this from Dr. Vivek Murthy,
former Surgeon General
of the United States,
he really, I think,
brought our attention to
the loneliness pandemic.
Yes.
There's a loneliness pandemic
in this world,
and there's no doubt about that
in my mind.
So when people are socially
disconnected with insecurity,
one or more of the areas
I talked about,
that is a predecessor, not for
all people, but for many people
then to be on a course of a more
difficult to treat depression.
People have to be
socially connected.
If we can
socially connect people,
and we can reduce the insecurity
in those areas we talked about,
I think that's some of the most
potent antidepressant steps
getting people towards recovery.
The issue though is
when you are feeling depressed
you naturally isolate,
which can make you feel worse.
Absolutely.
And moves you away from any
opportunities to do that.
ROGER:
Yeah, it absolutely does,
and you touched on
a very sensitive point,
because one of the features
of depression
that's a core feature,
a defining feature,
we in the business call it
"anhedonia"
which just simply means
the absence of pleasure.
It was coined by a French
psychologist way back in 1896,
a long time ago.
And it really is
just feeling blah.
Yeah.
People are disengaged,
disinterested, no joy,
nothing to look forward to.
And what our research has shown
is not only what
you just spoke to,
so interpersonal
loss of interest,
not only is that common
but it's one of the most
powerful predictors of suicide.
When someone has lost a
futuristic sort of view,
not looking forward to
the future,
and when that collides with
interpersonal anhedonia,
Eric, that's a combustible mix.
I want to pause on that
for just a second
before we move onto other things
that can inform and create
these difficult to treat
depressions.
But I think it's really easy
for someone
who hasn't been depressed
to see depression as
an extreme form of sadness.
They felt sad,
so ratchet that up,
that's what depression
must be.
Right.
And it's really maybe better
to see it
as a complete absence
of feeling.
I've had people tell me when
they've come out of a depression
that sadness felt like a gift.
That they could feel again.
They had been sort of living
with the whole spectrum
of their emotions
being unplugged from the wall.
Is that an important thing
to lay down here
for someone trying to understand
just what depression is?
It is, because over the years,
just when I've met
so many people,
I have such a privilege
hearing their story,
what you just hit on is, in
fact, the essence of depression.
They've lost the basic them.
They don't feel any emotion,
they don't feel
the usual executive control
over their emotion,
they can't even feel anything.
Right.
And I've asked patients for
years, "Do you feel depressed?"
"I don't feel anything."
Yeah.
Now, not to get too lost
in sort of glossary,
but psychiatry loves glossary,
we have this big massive
psychiatry glossary.
And there's a term called
alexithymia
which Peter Sifneos coined
many years ago.
Okay.
Alexithymia refers to the
inability to name your emotion,
called emotional blindness.
Yes.
It's very common in depression,
you can't even name it,
you don't even know the source
of it, can't even name it.
So the difficulty of
even experiencing anything,
and or an emotional blunting,
people are so blunted,
indifferent to everything,
and or they just feel
nothing but negativity.
So this is all
sort of happening,
each person's different,
and you get a combination
of this inability to
experience emotion,
nothing but blunting
day in, day out,
and or this
negativistic emotional state
that's just agonizing, which is
accompanied by this, this reel,
this ruminating reel...
Yes. Yeah.
That just like locks you in this
sort of checkmate situation
of just negativistic anxiety
producing very dour
kind of themes.
That is what I hear day in,
day out.
And when it comes to
childhood trauma.
Yeah, big topic.
What... what does chil--
Let's start slow.
What does childhood trauma
do to someone
that can later lead to these
difficult to treat depressions
that feel really ingrained
in them.
Yeah, one of the most
reproducible factors
that we've uncovered
with respect to folks
who have struggled with response
to conventional antidepressants
with their depression
is a history of trauma.
Right.
Now, trauma can be any time
in their life,
as a child or as an adult,
but childhood trauma,
maybe not surprising,
is especially,
especially hazardous.
That's a time, obviously,
with interpersonal development,
cognitive development,
educational attainment,
it affects that.
But it also affects the
developing neurobiology
of the brain.
And the developing neurobiology
pursues a fairly predictable
course and trajectory.
And when you have
a trauma event,
especially when it's
a repetitive trauma...
Right.
..and especially when it's from
people who are close to you,
caretakers, parents, and so on,
it creates what I call
a cascade event.
You've ignited a whole set of
biological advance that cascade,
causing an off trajectory
development of your brain.
Your brain is literally
different at age 25...
Yeah.
..when compared to someone who's
25 that didn't have trauma.
And we can trace it back to
the effect of the
abnormal stress response
created by the trauma that
saved you in the short-term.
Yes, yes, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Stress responses, Eric,
they save us in the near term,
they get us past the stressor,
but they leave a bit of sort of
friendly fire, so to speak.
And you've actually altered
the trajectory off-course.
And this is very, very common
in people who have depression.
It becomes difficult to treat.
Yeah, so can you draw a line
between that feeling people have
when they're very depressed of
being, uh, not feeling anything?
Of feeling like their emotions
are unplugged from the wall.
Can you draw a line between that
and childhood trauma?
You sure can.
Yeah.
So, what you touched on is such
a critical and subtle point.
So what often will happen,
someone will have a history of
trauma in youth or as a child,
and what will happen is is they
may not have a medical diagnosis
of Major Depressive Disorder.
Okay.
But in retrospect, as a
25-year-old or 30-year-old
down their adult life,
they look back and they'll say,
"You know something? Throughout
my high school years,
"I was really just blunted,
I was just sort of passive,
"I was indifferent
to everything.
"Nothing made me happy,
nothing made me cry.
"I had this indifference.
"And I started to notice
that I was just disengaged
"interpersonally, socially.
"I just couldn't seem to have
any kind of sort of motivation."
And that's often
rooted in the trauma.
What happens,
among other things, Eric,
is that when you have
a trauma event,
the cascade of events of
changes parts of the brain...
Yeah.
..that are responsible for you
and I to be able to think.
And also for you and I
to experience emotion.
Because the brain is trying to
protect you from the harm,
the external harm,
and it's compromised the
normal emotional development
and emotional regulation,
and the cognitive development.
And as a constant, people say,
"I can't... I think I got ADHD,
"I can't focus,
I can't pay attention.
"I find that I'm moody
when I don't want to be moody.
"I'm not even sure
what's going on with me
"and I don't even need
a trigger,
"I'm kinda moody
with people."
And that's a loss of the chief
executive officer, the brain,
the cognition,
over the emotional setting.
And that's triggered
predictably at a very high rate
in people with trauma.
And then, to add further
compound to this, Eric,
what happens is when you and I
are exposed to stress
the body doesn't
know any different,
the body mounts
a stress response.
As if you were a kid again.
As a kid.
So you're almost
travelling back in time.
Absolutely.
And then, what happens is that
people then start noticing
they're eating more,
they start gaining weight.
So, along with depression,
then you have obesity,
type-2 diabetes,
you have heart disease,
and this is a very common
collection of disorders
that accompany depression
in general,
but especially when
someone reports trauma.
So, yeah, to put a maybe too
neat and tidy of a narrative
around it, uh, you are a kid
in a chaotic environment.
Yeah.
Um, you don't know maybe when
you're going to be cared for,
and when you're not.
Right, right.
What you're going to receive,
it's chaotic, it's stressful,
it's painful.
Yeah.
And so, there is that defense
mechanism you're talking about.
Right.
Where you unplug.
Yeah.
You don't feel any of the bad.
No.
Unfortunately, you don't feel
any of the good emotions,
you feel nothing.
That helps you survive
at a young age.
And then, when you flash
forward to when you're an adult
it's the same response.
So that defense mechanism that
helped you survive as a kid
is what becomes your depression
when you're an adult?
In many ways that's true.
Okay.
In many ways,
what's happening is
is that when you are
traumatized as a child,
or as a young person,
in addition to affecting
the brain's architecture
and its overall function,
what's happening is
that the brain's stress response
has become super sensitized.
And so, when you're a late
teenager, early 20s,
you're a bit more sensitive now
to stressors that happen.
And a lot of people go on
to even have concurrent
posttraumatic stress
along with depression.
But most people with depression
don't have PTSD.
Right.
But the phenomenon's similar.
And so when they're exposed to
a stressful event
their system
becomes overwhelmed.
Because the stressor
since childhood
hasn't provided for them the
environment to mature, to grow,
and have full executive control
over the stress response.
So, what seems to be a
relatively manageable stressor
as an adult, for them,
becomes unmanageable,
and then triggers
this negativistic mood state,
this thinking state,
and other symptoms of depression
like loss of appetite
and sleep, and so on.
So, there's trauma.
Yeah.
But there's also genetics.
Yeah.
And you often hear that mental
illness can run in families.
It sure does.
And I think people might think
that's a genetic picture
versus a trauma one.
Right.
Yeah, let's go in slow here
for genes.
Where does genetics factor in
in terms of predisposing someone
to these more
difficult to treat depressions?
It's such a great question.
Just to provide
a bit of a benchmark.
Yeah, yeah.
So there's no question that
there is a genetic contribution
to many serious
mental illnesses.
We, in fact, are still frankly,
if I could use a Netflix
sort of metaphor,
we're still on episode one,
season one,
maybe episode two,
season one of genetics.
Okay, what's the show?
The show is called
"Unravelling the Mystery
"of This Situation
Called Mental Illness".
Okay, that's a long title,
but yeah.
It's a long title.
I gotta give it more of
a kind of a catchier
kind of bumper sticker title.
But that's the gist of it.
And schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder and ADHD,
the genetic risk has been
estimated to be at about, uh,
75-90%.
Okay.
Even higher.
All that means translated is the
vulnerability to the condition
is clearly very genetic.
Right.
There's an environmental
component as well,
and this has been arrived at
by looking at twin studies,
you know monozygotic, dizygotic,
family studies,
this type of thing.
What do those mean,
mono and... yeah?
Yeah, so identical twins,
fraternal twins.
Okay.
If one sibling
has the condition,
does the other sibling have it?
And very smart geneticists
and mathematicians
can work out the genetic
contribution to mental illness.
Okay.
And they land on 75-90%-ish.
Yeah.
In depression, on the average,
let's say, Roger, time for
your exam, oral exam.
What's the genetic liability
to depression?
I would say, well,
it's about 40% or so.
Okay.
And then, what's it for
difficult to treat depression?
Probably close to 50-60%.
Okay.
So that gives us
at least a hint, a hint,
that there's something about
this difficult to treat
depression
that may be a little different
than the depressions
that are responding to
your Prozac type drugs.
Okay. Yes, yes.
And trauma is an
environmental event,
but let's not forget that
trauma affects the genetics.
Yes, okay,
that's what I was--
We easily get stuck into
an either or.
Correct.
Is the better way of looking at
this that there are some folks,
um, genetically that are
more susceptible and sensitive
to what happens
in their environment?
100%.
Almost like they're more of
a slightly warmed up
piece of clay.
Absolutely.
Where whatever happens to them
can sink in a little bit deeper.
It is, and it's also
what's called...
now we're seeing this data
come out in psychiatry
where if the parent has been
subjected to trauma
in their lifetime,
the vulnerability to an
abnormal stress response
could be transmitted
to the child.
So you could get this almost
transgenerational passing
of what is an
abnormal stress response.
That's epigenetics?
That's epigenetically related.
Now, when someone has depression
begin very young in life
that also increases
the likelihood
there's a genetic contribution.
But keep in mind that,
as you said,
it's hard to disambiguate
what's the genetic,
what's the environment here.
'Cause often the environment
could be one of, let's say,
economic insecurity, living in
a high crime neighbourhood
or a poverty-ridden
neighbourhood.
Maybe you live in a food desert,
there's no good food for, you
know, 10, 20, 30 miles around,
so you have malnutrition,
this type of thing.
So, all these factors
tend to cluster.
But taken together,
Treatment Resistant Depression
seems to have a higher
genetic loading to it,
which tells us that maybe
there's something about
this particular entity,
at least,
that is different than
depression
that is quite responsive to
Fluoxi-- or Prozac type drugs.
Right, right.
Um, okay, I think now
is a perfect time.
Okay.
We teased it at the top.
Okay.
I think we can
talk about Ketamine.
Yeah.
Uh, and Esketamine.
Yeah, sure.
So, um, I mean,
we should go in slowly here.
Yeah.
What are they?
Well, they're probably
the biggest innovations
in the treatment of depression
in seven decades.
It's an incredible history.
A person named Karl Ritthouse...
Ritthausen in 1866,
and he was looking at
wheat gluten,
and he found this amino acid
in the wheat gluten,
he called it "glutamate"
after "gluten".
And later in the 1980s,
so 100 years later,
it was discovered that
this is playing a key role
in the brain's ability
to function.
We call it plasticity.
So if you and I go to the gym,
you go to the gym quite a bit,
Eric,
if you lift weights,
your muscles get bigger,
that's muscle plasticity,
your muscles are responding
to the environmental load.
Brain plasticity is similar,
the neurons, the brain cells,
they react to the environment.
And glutamate
plays a critical role.
We always say that
brain cells that fire together
wire together.
Right.
ROGER:
And the neurons in your brain
are connected, I call it CNN,
just like circuits, nodes,
and networks in your head.
So just a group of networks
and circuits in your brain.
And glutamate is what keeps them
all functioning together.
Okay.
Okay?
You got your motherboard
on your computer,
it's just like
what your brain is.
For it to work
you need a glutamate.
They discovered this in 1866.
But what Ketamine
and Esketamine does
is they target that
particular neurotransmitter.
Okay.
And so, for many people
who've had depression
that's been going on for years,
my gentleman I mentioned earlier
hasn't benefited from the more
conventional approaches,
this treatment just shows up
on our lap 25 years ago,
in the year 2000
it was first studied.
Shown to be not just effective
in some very difficult to treat
situations, but rapidly so.
So you go to the airport,
you got the regular lineup,
you got the fast track.
It's a fast track.
Who wants-- Can you imagine
going to the emergency room
with a migraine headache?
The staff say,
"Oh, we got a treatment for
your migraine headache,
"it takes six weeks
to work."
Yeah.
You'd say, "This is outrageous."
But that's what we tell
people with depression,
wait six weeks for it to work.
Yep.
That is outrageous.
Mmhmm.
And so, the advantage of not
only targeting this new system
is that it's targeting
a key mechanism in the brain
that we implicate
in the process.
And people get better,
they get better within one day.
It's a single--
Within one--
It's sometimes a single dose?
Within one-- In some cases.
Okay.
Within one day.
In fact, the USFDA recognizes
that Esketamine,
which is sort of the
sister drug of Ketamine,
is one that is rapid acting,
which means it works
within a week.
You know what the most important
thing is?
What?
People say to me, "Roger,
does it work in everybody?"
No, I wish it did.
How many people
does it work in out of 100?
I would say, uh, meaningfully?
20-50%. They say,
"Oh, that's not 100%."
I said, yeah, true.
True, we're getting there.
Yeah.
But you know what it does?
It gives people hope
and that's not measurable.
That's not measurable.
Yeah.
And the agony that I have seen
in 30 years,
the hope that it gives,
that's not measurable.
So I don't think we're in
a position as clinicians
to write that, 'cause
that's not something we are...
we can't be so arrogant.
Right.
And I think that that is an
enormous, enormous offering
of the treatment.
I did want to say...
bust out a little stat here.
So you can have a sip of water
and hop in for a sec.
(Chuckling)
So, there was one study
that showed,
and this is for folks with
Major Depressive Disorder,
when it comes to
antidepressants.
And this is folks that had
a history of trauma
between the ages of 4 and 7.
Yep.
Only 16% achieved remission
after eight weeks of treatment
with three different types of
common antidepressants.
That's right.
I cannot pronounce them
and I will not.
We can maybe try later.
Mmhmm.
Um, compared to 84%
of individuals
with no history of
childhood trauma.
That's a big gap.
Yeah.
When it comes to Ketamine...
Yeah?
..are we seeing
a similar gap like that,
or is it working for folks
with childhood trauma?
What a great question,
that's the iSPOT-D trial,
it's a very important trial
in the United States.
Okay.
And that really hits home
the point that in depression
there are a series of symptoms
that make the diagnosis.
And we're talking about trauma.
And trauma's a historical event
that just seems to be, um,
setting the stage for
a very disappointing outcome
in depression, at least with
the Prozac type drugs.
Mmhmm.
It turns out that's not the
case with drugs like Ketamine
and Esketamine, they seem to
work as well, in fact,
maybe even better.
I can't say that with confidence
but I can say they work as well,
which is amazing, in people
who have depression and trauma
as they do in people with
depression and no trauma.
And we've been trying to
figure out
what is the mechanism of that.
Yeah.
And people would know
Ketamine is an anaesthetic,
it's being used for
pain management.
We use it as an antidepressant.
But the other part about this,
Eric,
which is really interesting,
and that is is that Ketamine's
also an anti-inflammatory.
Okay.
And that's not well-known
but it's true.
Okay.
It's a potent anti-inflammatory.
People say, "What, like Aspirin
or like a Ibuprofen, like that?"
Well, sorta yes
but sort of not the same.
It's an anti-inflammatory.
And when you have trauma
what happens is your body
mounts a stress response.
And among other
friendly fires,
trauma creates a
pro-inflammation in your brain,
it increases inflammation
in your brain.
Yeah.
And that's what makes you
feel so tired.
That's what makes you feel so--
It's like a sickness response.
Like a sickness syndrome.
Yeah.
And we've all had, you know,
common colds, COVID,
everybody knows
what that feels like.
You feel blah, you lost your
motivation, your interests,
your desire, you can't sleep,
no appetite.
That's called Sickness Syndrome,
that's inflammation.
And Ketamine reduces it.
Yeah.
And so, we don't think
that's the only mechanism,
but there's an academic interest
in this question
that maybe Ketamine is so potent
in people with
a history of trauma
because it's anti-inflammatory.
In terms of the experience...
Yeah.
..I've got a great quote here.
One patient described it as,
this was after a series of
Ketamine sessions,
as "not a temporary change
but a shift in who I am,
"how I approach the world,
"and my feelings towards
my own emotions."
Mmhmmm.
Can you relate to that
with some of the patients
you've worked with?
I can, and when I first heard
patients describing this to me
quite some time ago, this is
what really incentivized me
to bring this treatment
to patients here.
In the sense that I heard
patients, first of all,
describe hope again,
they weren't suicidal,
and they described very much
what you just described.
And there's been a real effort
to look under the hood,
so to speak,
to look at the brain,
what's going on, in people
who are reporting this.
And what we see is
something truly fascinating.
When you give a single treatment
of Ketamine
you see immediate effects
in the brain.
The networks of the brain,
the circuits of the brain,
they immediately
begin to change.
Now these changes we also see
with the old-fashioned
antidepressants,
the Prozac type drugs,
but those effects take
4-6 weeks to happen.
And this is happening
right away.
But in contradistinction to
the Prozac type drugs,
we're also seeing effects
in the brain
where those Prozac drugs
don't really work so well.
Yeah.
And what the Prozac drugs
are not as good at
is making you feel more
motivated, more interested,
more engaged with yourself.
Hm.
A sense of completeness
and coherent and cohesive.
Yeah.
And these drugs,
the Ketamine, the Esketamines,
are immediately giving you this
sense of reintegration again
which is interesting.
Because the subjective report
maps onto what we're seeing
in our MRI scans, that the
brain's looking more integrated.
Are they thinking less?
They are putting less effort
into thinking,
but they get more efficient.
Right.
There's a sort of efficiency.
So if you could ima--
I used to use the example of
Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire.
Okay.
And then, people say, "That's
too old, they're too old,
"you gotta use a newer, maybe
Travis Kelce and", you know,
"Taylor Swift."
Let's go with Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astaire, come on.
I like Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astaire.
One of the great,
great dancers of all time.
Yeah.
And I've always said--
We can put in a clip right now
of Fred Astaire,
and then we'll come back to you.
Yeah.
I've always said that
the best metaphor for me,
when you look at the brain
in an MRI scanner
it really is fascinating.
You see the circuits
and it's like Ginger Rogers
and Fred Astaire,
they're dancing together,
and they're in a certain
reciprocity with each other,
they're just
perfectly dancing.
Right.
And when you have depression
it's like watching

Dancing With the Stars
but they're not stars.
They're just not--
they're not in kilter here.
And when you treat them
with Ketamine and Esketamine
then you see the Ginger Rogers,
Fred Astaire come back.
And patients say, "Wow, I'm
feeling like myself again,
"I can sort of
feel my emotion again,
"and I can feel, like,
normal again."
In balance.
Yeah.
And so, it's-- And that's
a highly replicated finding
that you have this effect
on the brain circuits
and the networks
immediately,
in key regions that are
relevant to us to feel,
to think, and behave.
There was another analogy
I wanted to throw out.
I love your Fred Astaire
and Ginger Rogers one.
I use it before--
I'm going to look them up
after this so I can picture it.
Well, I used it before
and one of my students said,
"Who's that?" I felt like a
fossil. I said, "Oh, my gosh."
It is, I mean,
it's probably...
we're not going to be able to
use the video of it,
but it would be
in black and white.
(Big band jazz music playing)
The other analogy I've heard,
and this is for psilocybin,
which is the active ingredient
in magic mushrooms.
Right, right.
It is like a ski hill.
So you can get the ski tracks
in the hill are your thoughts.
And sometimes people can get
deeply grooved into these...
Yes?
..toxic, looping,
ruminative thoughts...
Awful, awful.
..that it's all you're thinking
about, you're locked in.
And what psilocybin,
and I'm curious if this is
true for Ketamine,
is it basically puts down
a fresh coat of snow.
Mmhmm.
So you can get out of
those thoughts.
Mmhmm.
Is that a helpful way of
trying to understand
what Ketamine is
offering people?
Well, I think that's a
fair way of putting it,
and you're right to also even
bring psilocybin
into the conversation.
And I think psilocybin is
still in the early innings
of the ball game here,
but it's...
Ketamine has gotten over the
wall, it's been shown to work,
Esketamine's gotten over
the wall, shown to work.
Psilocybin, again,
is still in development.
But it's exactly right.
And see, for us as human beings,
what we're able to do
is we are able to select,
we're able to sequence,
we're able to inhibit,
we're able to modify
how we feel, how we think,
and how we behave.
And when you're depressed
you lose that.
In your mind you lose
the ability to control
how you're going to
shift your attention.
I want to focus on this,
I want to focus on that,
but I can't because I'm so
hijacked by this negativistic,
making me more depressed,
more irritable, more despondent,
more anxious, reel that...
and I can't seem to break it.
That's a problem with
the cognitive function.
And then, what's happening is
Mother Nature's got our brain
wired in such a way
that our cognitive processes
are stitched into
the fabric our emotion.
And so, the negativistic
thoughts are woven tightly
with all the negative threads.
Mmhmm.
And then,
people just can't break it.
And, no surprise, a lot of
people tell me, you know,
"The only thing I...
I just wanna get drunk.
"I wanna just smoke drugs."
Yeah.
"I gotta break this."
Yeah.
And so,
that is called rumination,
and it's a very common,
very debilitating,
and very difficult part.
A lot of people call it
obsessionality.
It's not really obsessions
it's called rumination.
To throw another analogy
out there,
and we can do an old movie,
let's do Hitchcock's
 The Birds.
Okay.
Uh, my friend once describe
the depression he experienced
as basically Hitchcock's
 Birds

cawing at him at all times.
Oh, wow.
He would try to look up
into the sky
and it would be
Hitchcock's
 Birds.
Wow.
And I think those are
the ruminative, toxic...
Yes, yes.
..looping thoughts.
And when he was able to
step out of a depression
it was like the birds went away
and he could see the sky again,
he could see the world.
So I'm curious for your patients
has it been this feeling
of really stepping
out of your head,
and getting to be
back in the world,
getting to even be with people
in a way that
if you were around others
before
you might feel lonely
and disconnected?
Well, you know how it feels?
It feels impossible to describe
when you see people get better
in this business.
And, uh, you know,
I'm a person who likes success.
And I want my patients
to get better.
And I gotta say that
when someone gets better
the way you're just describing,
um,
they don't even need to tell
you, you can feel the vibe.
Okay?
Yeah, the second
they walk in.
It's just they're a person,
they're so engaged with you,
and it's thrilling,
and it's fun, it's reinforcing,
it's what makes it so rewarding.
Um, and my hope is
is that before I'm retired
we'll have that happen
100% of the time.
But it happens
a lot of the time.
Is there a story of someone in
particular that comes to mind?
Well, there's one gentleman
in particular
that comes to mind right away,
it's a story I often tell.
This was a gentleman, Eric,
that was referred to me.
And he had struggled,
he was an executive,
very high functioning person,
and he had been...
Ready for this?
He had been on over 40
different treatments. Okay?
Now, you sort of think, "Well,
how many treatments are there?"
Uh, well, there's a lot.
He was on 40 different
treatments ranging from, uh,
the medications,
the talk therapy,
electroshock therapy, ECT, so
on, we call it neuromodulation.
And, in fact, he even went for
deep brain surgery
for his depression.
Right.
Right? For neurosurgery.
And so, I think
we're going to agree
the man had a difficult
to treat depression.
Yeah.
And I remember
when he got better, um,
and admittedly no one's
going to expect his chances
were going to be high,
but he got better.
And I remember
when he came to the office
'cause I had only known him
as someone who was in agony
every visit,
and he'd come in and the
poor guy was in so much agony.
I remember when
he came to the meeting
and I remember like it
happened five minutes ago.
I came out and saw him
in the waiting room
and I could tell like something
was just completely different,
it was just
completely different.
And it's almost like, you know,
it's like when you haven't
seen someone for a long time,
a friend, and that energy
and the emotion that's there,
their personhood
is right before you.
And it's apparent,
it's apparent.
I've often said that psychiatry
is half mathematics
and it's half Shakespeare.
And you and I are talking about
the Shakespeare.
Yeah.
And it comes across.
And you say to a friend,
you know, "I saw a good show."
"Well, what was good about it?"
"It was a good show."
You're talking about
the art of it,
and that's
the art of psychiatry.
Yeah. How did he get better?
Well, he got better
with Ketamine.
Right, okay.
In fact, it was one of
the critical moments--
I'm sort of a person who is,
at some point,
if you show me enough pictures
that the world is round,
I'm willing to believe you.
Yeah.
But I'm not going to believe it
'til I see the pictures first.
Okay? I'm not going to
sort of be inflexible.
But when Ketamine
first came out...
Yeah.
..it was discussed at
academic meetings and so on,
I mean, is this
too good to be true?
And I suppose, in some respects,
I was as guilty as the
group think as everybody else
in the sense that
I was just used to
the mediocre batting average
of our current treatments,
and having to wait 4-6 weeks,
and patients not that happy
a lot of the time.
Yeah.
Some patients are, let's be very
clear, let's be very clear.
Yeah, yeah.
I don't want-- This isn't about
old treatments don't work.
Uh, they have changed lives,
they've saved lives.
I've seen many people get back
on track with Prozac type drugs.
But the fact is
at least two-thirds don't,
and we need new options.
And so, I was skeptical
but, again,
science is about
lightbulb moments.
And science is about
we sort of...
..we're sort of wandering along
in this park of unknowing,
which is the park of science.
And then, all of a sudden,
the lightbulb turns on.
And that streetlamp
with the lightbulb, whoa,
and there's the answer
right in front of you.
Yeah.
This is a drug
we've had since 1962.
Right.
We know it's safe.
And we know it's very safe,
it's on the
World Health Organization's
list of
essential medicines.
So, what are some
potential downsides
for people that use Ketamine,
medically, or Esketamine?
What are some of the
negative side effects
we can be looking at here?
Some of the side effects people
can get is they can be sedated,
they can have what's called
dissociation,
which means that their
perceptions are a little off
a little bit, it's not
that pleasant for people,
they can get dizziness,
get a bit of nausea.
You know,
gastrointestinal upset,
that can certainly happen.
These tend to be transient, they
don't tend to be deal breakers.
We are very vigilant...
Right.
..as to whether Ketamine
can cause
any long-term safety concerns
to your heart, your kidney,
your bladder, your liver,
your brain.
Is it causing
cognitive impairment?
People often say,
"Well, don't Ketamine abusers,
doesn't it destroy their brain?"
Well, if you abuse anything
in life
it's probably not
going to be good for you.
Right.
You know, if you actually
abuse Ketamine,
let's say as
a street party drug,
there's evidence to show it can
do some damage to your brain.
So the obvious question is
if you take Ketamine
under medical supervision
for depression
does it damage your brain?
No, it does not do that.
It actually, if anything,
is protecting your brain.
Depression is a cancer
to your brain,
and it's really damaging
to your brain.
And Ketamine is
protecting the brain,
we're not seeing long-term, you
know, disturbance in the brain,
or any kind of toxicology.
Which, of course, the FDA
is keeping a close on
through the monitoring systems.
People vote with their feet.
What's the dropout rate on
these drugs for side effects?
Less than 1-3%.
Less than 1-5%.
Where does psychotherapy
fit in here?
Critical.
So the evidence shows that
if you are taking Prozac
for your depression,
and you got a really
difficult to treat depression,
adding a psychotherapy
to the medication,
1+1=3, we love that mathematic
in psychiatry.
One plus-- That's why
I'm in psychiatry.
So if you're going to be
doing Ketamine,
you can be doing it
concurrently with therapy.
Yeah.
If anything, that would
probably help more.
ROGER:
There's a good chance it could.
In fact, we're doing a study
right now with CIHR,
the Canadian Government agency's
funding at our centre,
looking at whether
if we could combine
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy,
CBT, with Ketamine,
can that actually rapidly
alleviate thoughts of suicide
and sustain it longer?
Well, you've warmed up the brain
to be more plastic.
I would say,
to use another word,
we're on a metaphor
sort of journey here.
Yeah, it's a lot.
Let's pile them all up, yeah.
I've lost count.
Yeah.
But I think if you took Ozempic
for weight loss...
Okay.
I think most of us would say,
"You know something?
"You probably would do better
if you also changed diet,
"if you did some exercise."
Right, yeah.
And of course, change
your lifestyle, and so on.
I don't think anyone's
going to disagree with that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But I think some people, 'cause
I know some of these people,
are taking Ozempic and they're
not changing their lifes--
I'm not saying that's
the right or wrong thing.
Right.
I'm only saying that not
everyone needs therapy.
But as a guiding principle,
I would say that when you add
an evidence-based psychotherapy,
such as Cognitive Behaviour
Therapy, to an IV Ketamine,
for example,
I think you're right.
The Ketamine has primed
the plasticity,
and then,
through the psychotherapy,
you can begin to really,
in fact,
really lock in some of
those gains, if you will.
Yeah, yeah.
And maybe also take away tactics
that help you cope
more effectively, which
decreases your vulnerability
for future abnormal
stress responses.
Okay, last question.
Yeah.
I want to take you back to...
It was the mid-90s
you started out, right?
Mid-90s.
Mid-90s.
Uh, yeah, I graduated...
I started as a psychiatrist
in '98.
Okay, '98.
From then 'til now,
how much better have we become
at being able to target
and treat
these difficult to treat
depressions?
I would say we've...
We've, uh, we've made an
exciting leap forward, Eric.
I mean, I gotta say, if we
would've had this conversation
15 years--
I wrote an article.
Mmhmm.
I don't think anyone read it,
so I want to tell you about it.
(Laughing) Yeah.
I wrote it about 10 years ago.
Academics, the biggest illusion
academics have is they--
Everybody reads their articles,
yeah.
So, I wrote an article
and it wasn't dour,
I wasn't trying to be dour
about it and negativistic,
but I said psychiatry's in a bit
of a cul-de-sac right now.
Right.
And I felt that, it was
more just a description.
I said we're in a cul-de-sac,
we gotta think differently.
We're kind of in--
We're not going anywhere here.
We need new targets,
we need new innovation.
And so, the promise now
has come to the innovation.
Now we're talking
about Ketamine.
There's been some really
exciting advances
with neuromodulation
like TMS, Transcranial
Magnetic Stimulation.
Yep.
It's really been very
interesting how that's advanced.
And I won't go through
all the details right now,
but we have over a dozen,
over a dozen, drug types
that are in development in mid
to late phase for depression,
didn't even exist
five years ago,
that are totally different
than the old Prozac type drugs.
I-I-I think it's not hyperbole.
I do not think it's superlative.
This is the most exciting
hopeful time for me,
as someone who's done this now
for almost 30 years.
This is an incredible time.
I've always said that
before I leave this business
I want to use the word 'cure'.
People say, "Oh,
you're out to lunch."
I don't think
that's out to lunch.
And I think that
we're not going to be there
in the next five years on cure.
But I think if we can
change the arc of the illness
so people can actually say,
"You know what?
"If I take this intervention
"I'm going to stop the illness
in it's track,
"it's not going to just progress
and destroy my life forever,
"I can be with my kids,
my family,
"have a fulfilling good life."
that's, in fact, the future
of where we're at right now.
It is truly a thrilling time
in this field.
We're getting better
at treating it.
We are.
But are we getting worse at
creating it?
That's a great point.
We are never going to
have enough
mental health care providers.
Right.
So, clearly, we need to
find a way to decrease,
as you're getting at,
the start of the problem
in the first place.
So I don't think you can have
a coherent, comprehensive,
impactful approach to this
scourge called depression
until you're approaching this
from a public health
perspective.
Clearly that's the case.
And for those who have
experienced depression,
we've got a whole new kit
of treatments for you.
But I like the way
you've described it
'cause I happen to think
that the great vaccination
against depression is
in the public health side.
And I'm really concerned about
the loneliness pandemic,
I think it's a major,
major problem for humanity,
not just for depression.
And that, along with
what we're seeing
in terms of the hazardous
consequence of social media,
and, again, the insecurities
I've described,
these are combustible mixes.
And I think that, you know,
these things obviously
you need to have political will,
and advocacy, and support.
Uh, but that has to be
part of the conversation.
I did want to finish
on this.
You are a busy human being.
(Laughing)
This is wild,
I don't know,
maybe I'll look into
this camera.
I was trying to choose what
titles to say in the intro.
Right.
And this is all of
Roger's titles,
I don't know if
you can see that.
Well, thank you for spending
so much time, Roger,
I appreciate it.
Oh, thanks, Eric.
It's always a real joy to be
able to hang out
and speak with you.
Nice chatting with you, Eric,
it's been a lot of fun.
Thank you.
