>> It's hard to think of the TV
show Friends without thinking
of Matthew Perry, but he was
a lot more than his character,
Chandler Bing.
He was also a proud Canadian,
a diehard hockey fan,
and by all accounts,
a genuinely funny guy
who wanted to help others.
I talked with his sister,
Caitlin Morrison, about
the Matthew Perry Foundation
and how they're honouring
his legacy by supporting people
with addiction
and mental health challenges.
And then, John Candy, before
Hollywood and movies like
Planes, Trains and Automobiles,
he was a Second City kid
in Toronto and one of
the breakout stars of SCTV
in the 1970s.
He even made an appearance
on a TVO kids show
called Cucumber.
>> What is it?
Is it a bird?
Is it a plane?
Is it?
>> It's a weatherman.
Mind if I stay until
it stops raining?
>> This year we got a new
documentary and a new biography
about him.
I talked with author
Paul Myers about why John
Candy's work still hits home
more than 30 years after
his death.
This is The Rundown.
The media usually refers to
Friends star Matthew Perry,
but the Canadian-born actor
and comedian had a different
goal: being remembered
for helping others.
Since Perry died two years ago,
his family and friends have been
working to honour that goal.
They established
Matthew Perry House,
a supportive recovery community
in Ottawa for people with
addiction and mental health
challenges.
To learn more about
Perry's life and legacy, I sat
down with Caitlin Morrison,
the executive director of
Matthew Perry House
and the actor's sister.
Caitlin.
Great to have you here.
How are you doing?
>> It's great to be here.
I am good,
I am overwhelmed, I'm great.
>> Let's get to know Matthew
Perry through your eyes.
Here's a picture with you
and your older brother,
Matthew Perry.
Give us a sense.
What was.
What was he like?
What kind of a brother was he?
>> Amazing.
He was the funniest
older brother, probably,
that anybody ever had.
So it was a lot of
really cool slapstick gags
and, you know, kind of
learning to be funny and steal
his sense of humour,
which I think I did.
And but also the other thing
is he was very,
very overprotective.
So well into my 20s,
he was still saying things
like, oh, I don't,
I don't know, I don't know if
it's really a good idea for you
to go out past 8:00 at night.
Are you sure that you're
comfortable with the people
you're going out with?
Are you sure you're allowed
to watch that on TV?
It's a little violent.
>> What were we watching?
>> It was some.
I can't even remember,
Saving Private Ryan or
something like that.
Maybe.
But it was.
You know, I'm a grownup.
I am a grownup now.
But I was always
a little tiny kid to him.
And he was always kind of
a a bigger version of a human
to me, too.
>> Now I understand.
True or false?
Here.
He's an Ottawa Sens fan.
You're a Leafs fan?
>> That is correct.
>> How did how did that
all come to be?
I'm sorry, Senators.
>> That's right.
We're we're in Toronto
right now.
So you're safe now.
Okay, okay.
Fair.
Good.
But yes.
No.
So I, I he grew up in Ottawa.
I lived in Ottawa until
I was about 4.
And at that point I did not
know what hockey was.
But once I came back to
Toronto and I got very invested
in hockey a little bit later,
I mean, the Leafs
and then, you know, you get
everybody here knows you get
disappointed every year,
you get hopeful the next year
and then you get disappointed
again.
And I feel like none of us
can let go of our fandom,
because what if they win
next year and we let go?
>> That is the that is the hope
of many Leafs fans.
Now Matthew Perry House
is in Ottawa.
>> The first one.
>> The first one is okay.
Tell me.
Tell me about his connection
to the city and why that was,
why that needed to be
the first one.
>> Well, I mean, he always was
an Ottawa kid.
>> What does that mean?
>> He.
He loved it.
It was his.
It was his home base.
It was his hometown.
He.
You know, that's where
he went to school.
It's where he met his
best friends for life.
It's it's.
I mean, he was even
looking at real estate
because he felt like he wanted
to go back there because
it would feel more like home.
So it was just kind of his spot.
And I love it there, too.
Beautiful place.
But I think his connection
was, you know, deeper-rooted.
And so that seemed like
the spot.
>> In terms of connections.
When he passed, he, he had
this quote.
He said, when I die,
I want helping others to be the
first thing that's mentioned.
That's a quote that's been sort
of talked about ever since
he has passed.
And I think it's an
important one.
But I want to understand why.
Why was it important that
Matthew, that people
remember him for that
and not for Chandler Bing
on Friends?
>> Well, I just that just made
me think of it in a whole new
way.
The fact that you asked
the question that way, and I
think it's because when he was
helping people and he did that
a lot, by the way,
when he was helping people,
that was what made him feel good
as a human being.
That made him feel like
something.
It took away a lot
of those things that he was
hiding away a lot of the time,
those those painful things.
And when he was just
making people laugh,
and when he was doing
the funny bit and when he was
all out there and, you know,
being the Chandler, I think all
that that pain was being pushed
down under the, the comedy
because, I mean, I didn't see
it most of the time.
Most people didn't see it
most of the time.
But I think for him, you know,
comedy was a coping
mechanism, but a healing
mechanism was realising that,
that he could find a way
to help other people.
It feels really good
to help other people.
>> Now you when you were
younger, you got to be on set
and see all of the jokes
and all the laughter
and all of that stuff.
But I'm curious.
Like you mentioned, you
probably didn't see the stuff
that whether it was Matthew or
other cast members or anyone,
just kind of sort of the dark
side or things that they were
dealing with on a personal
level.
Do you think there is a
bit of a stigma around mental
health still in the
entertainment industry?
>> I think there's a stigma
about mental health everywhere,
and I think it's internalised
too.
I think we we have a lot.
It's very easy for us to say
something like, oh, my back is
just driving me nuts, but it's
a little bit harder to say
I'm feeling really low today.
I just don't feel good.
>> How do you change that?
>> I think one of the ways
we change it is we make people
realise that that's an okay
thing to talk about, and I feel
like that's something that's
been changing a lot already.
People feel a lot more
comfortable talking about
that stuff.
They feel a little bit
more comfortable reaching out
for help.
So that's one thing.
But another piece is when
people are really struggling,
when they're in the, you know,
when the sort of the darkest
side of, of of mental health
issues, it seems so difficult
to solve.
It seems so.
It seems like something
you can't do anything about.
I mean, when you see
somebody who's at the point
where they almost seem to have
lost touch with the world
around them, they seem nothing
but angry.
They seem really frustrated.
There's a sense of,
I don't know what I'm supposed
to do about it.
I don't like to see it,
but I don't know what
I'm supposed to do about it.
And I think that kind of makes
us think, well, if I can't,
if I can't help, then,
then there's some.
There's either something wrong
with me or maybe I can decide
that that's not a person
who can be helped.
That's an unfixable situation.
And so it becomes stigmatised
because it's an easier way to
look at it, that it's just a
problem that we wish could be
erased, but we don't really
know what to do.
And I think it's actually
more of an everyone thing.
You know, it's it's it's
in it's in all we're all
half a step away from being
in a worst case scenario
of our own.
And I think the way that
Matthew found his true joy in
helping other people, I think
that we can find a much more
joyful and wonderful society
if we decide that instead of
trying to make ourselves more
comfortable, we start looking
around and saying, you know,
maybe I can help, I'm going to
at least try.
>> Well, one of the things some
would say is even having these
conversations that you and we
talk about being comfortable,
we were saying just off camera
that you're not very
comfortable being in front of
cameras yourself.
>> I'm terrified.
>> You don't like it.
But it's important to to to
talk about these conversations.
I am curious, in your opinion,
has the media had
a positive or negative
sort of conversation
around mental health?
What are you in terms of
their role and what they've
been able to do
over the last couple of years?
>> I think there's been a lot
going on that's been really
positive.
I think that you're
hearing about it more.
I think media
is talking about it more.
And I think that that it's sort
of being felt in the media
world, too, right?
That there's
there's more need for support,
even in the people who are,
who are living it.
I don't know about you,
but I think there's
just like for everyone else,
there's more uncertainty,
there's more, you know,
is this a stable thing?
Is this going to keep going?
Do we need to totally reinvent,
reinvent what we are?
Are we okay to be who
we are in this really rapidly
changing and very scary world?
So it's you know, it.
But but the fact that media
is choosing to talk about it
instead of pull a blanket
over it and ignore it is
a really good sign, I think.
>> What's one thing that you do
to maintain your mental health?
>> Well, first of all, I, I
spend a lot of time just
quietly spending time with my
family and that makes me,
you know, makes me very happy.
Brings me back to what's
important in life.
But I have I have developed
a new therapy, a new kind of
therapy.
I enjoy being a lumberjack.
So when I am feeling.
>> Cutting wood.
>> Yeah.
So I have in the on the,
in the place where I live,
there are some trees that are
not good for southern Ontario.
They're not supposed to be
there.
And they made their way
in and they're stubborn
and they they spread rapidly.
So I go and I try to get
rid of them.
If I'm in a bad mood, I go to
the backyard and I find one of
those trees and I chop it down
and I dig up its roots.
And that, by the way,
better workout than yoga
by far.
>> It's awesome.
>> There you go.
>> Okay.
Caitlin Morrison,
thank you so much for joining
us on the program.
>> Well, the pleasure's all
mine.
Thank you.
You know, this has been great.
>> John Candy is one of those
names that instantly makes you
smile.
And before he became a
Hollywood star, he was here in
Toronto as part of Second City,
a place that has plenty of
famous alumni Eugene Levy,
Catherine O'Hara, Martin Short,
Dan Aykroyd, Andrea Martin,
and of course, the late, great
John Candy.
I went down to Second City
to talk to Paul Myers,
author of John Candy: A Life in
Comedy, about Candy's love for
Second City, how much Toronto
shaped him, and people's
enduring love for him.
Plus, we also got into
a great story about what
happened when Candy
met Paul's brother.
Maybe you heard of him.
His name is Mike Myers.
Paul, really appreciate
you joining us here at
Second City Toronto.
As you can see, we're sitting
in the John Candy Box Theatre.
We had a very special
relationship with
the institution.
Tell me about it.
>> Well, this stage underneath
me is part of the building
where John Candy started.
It's Second City,
and it started his career,
and he almost didn't do it
because he wasn't really
going to audition for
Second City.
But Dan Aykroyd and
Valerie Bromfield were
auditioning and they were
friends of his.
And they said, come with us
to the auditions.
You can just sit in the back
and we'll have lunch afterwards.
And then they called his name
and he's like, you guys.
And and so that's what
started it.
He got in because he just did
an improv.
He'd never tried it before.
And it turns out he was
a natural.
>> You mentioned the floors.
These are the floors that he
has performed on.
When you first came in here,
the first thing that you did
was you knocked on the floor.
>> Yeah, I knocked on the floor.
>> It's.
>> Like this.
>> This little part of the
stage underneath us is where so
many of the greats of comedy,
frankly, not just Canadian
comedy.
We've exported these people
like Dan Aykroyd, like
Gilda Radner, like my own
brother Mike, you know,
elephant in the room, John
Candy, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas.
And they all got their start
here.
You know, on this piece
of stage.
>> Johnny Toronto, that is
the nickname that many know
John Candy as.
How did that story come about?
>> So when Candy first starts
dominating the Toronto Second
City, you know, he was one of
many.
But he was definitely a big
he was a big personality.
He lived large like he would.
He would outspend his own bank
account, you know.
But he wanted to have
the right thing.
So if they needed a limo for
something, he would just rent
a limo and they'd say, Johnny,
where are you going?
To get the money?
And, you know, he was like,
don't worry about it.
And they started nicknaming.
It might have been
Joe Flaherty.
They started calling him
Johnny Toronto.
Like he owns the town, right?
And it's a much longer story
and it's in the book, so
I don't want to, but.
>> In some ways.
Did he own Toronto?
>> Well, by by the time he
owned the Toronto Argonauts, I
think it was Dan Aykroyd turned
to somebody in the crowd
and said, look at him.
The crowd loves him.
And he brought the Grey Cup
to his hometown.
Is that he is.
They said he is Johnny Toronto.
He made it.
He became Johnny Toronto.
>> So John Candy achieved
global stardom.
We can name a bunch CTV,
Uncle Buck,
Planes, Trains and Automobiles
for a younger generation
would be Home Alone.
But he still remained
deeply rooted to Canada.
He was part owner of
the Toronto Argonauts alongside
Wayne Gretzky when they won
the Grey Cup in 1991.
Can you talk to us about
the pride he had for Canada?
>> You know, he, like so many
of the people we export, he
bought a house in Mandeville
Canyon in Los Angeles, but also
a farm in Queensville.
And so he had this ranch,
and he wanted to make sure
that his family knew
the Canadian life.
And he spent a lot of time
coming back and working with
Canadian actors.
Only film he directed
was a film called
Hostage For A Day, and he
populated the cast with people
like Robin Duke from Second
City and some of the people who
were in the mainstage cast at
the time, like John Hemphill,
Don Lake, Kathryn Greenwood,
and he really wanted to bring
people with him.
>> Therapist said we should be
a little less mocking in our
relationship.
>> Oh, is that what the
therapist said?
Well, I'm trying.
It's just that there's so much
in our marriage that calls for
it.
>> He worked really hard in
Canada.
The last film that got
released after his death was
Canadian Bacon, which is like
about our complex relationship
that that seemed to have
cleared up.
We don't have that
complex relationship anymore
with the United States.
But, you know,
I think he really felt
the two allegiances in a sense,
because California had been
good to him and America
had been good to him.
But you don't.
I'm I live in California.
I can tell you you are Canadian
the whole time, you know, and
no matter where you are,
you're Canadian first.
And I feel like I identified
with that when I was
reading about him.
>> You write in the book, he
lived large, he loved larger,
and the world loved him back
in return.
It was beautiful.
Can you elaborate on that?
>> Well, you know, it's
elaborating on something Andrea
Martin said in in her own
memoir, she talked about how
he was a volcano of joy.
He wanted to make happiness
for everywhere he went.
So he also wanted to be happy.
So part of his happiness came
from connecting with people.
He was on the phone
for hours every night.
He wanted to have
after-show parties.
Now, a lot of that meant
that he was eating
and drinking late at night,
which didn't help his health
condition.
But it was all based on
that wanting to be connected
with people all the time.
And I think he got into comedy
because it was a way of it's
it's weird because I say
control.
It's not a bad kind of
control, but you want to do
something to affect the room,
to affect the room
or the person in that room.
And comedy on a grand scale
affects many people, but it
also is one-on-one thing.
It's just a way of finding
joy, and joy is one of
those things that it's
contagious.
Once you give joy,
other people are joyful.
They spend, you know, and you
don't have to think that.
By the way,
that's an intellectualised
version of it.
It's I think with an animal
like John Candy was instinctive.
>> You share a lovely anecdote
in the book where your brother,
actor comedian Mike Myers,
met John Candy at the University
of Toronto on campus.
Tell me how
that very short interaction
kind of influenced.
Well, a comedian in the making.
>> Yeah.
Okay.
You know, similar to
the way Spider-Man was bit by
a radioactive spider,
this is Mike's origin story.
So Mike, kid brother is like,
goes to this comedy show.
He's a little kid.
He's kind of funny.
In fact, he was funny.
We didn't even know
how funny he was funny
on the schoolyard,
and he wouldn't even show us.
And he goes and he says to John
Candy like he's a young teen,
he's 16 or 17.
He says, Mr. Candy, sir,
how do I get into comedy?
>> And any other celebrity
would have given him possibly
terrible advice or no advice.
And, you know, Candy said,
there's there's a theatre
downtown called Second City
that I came from.
They have workshops.
If you go to the workshops,
you can find out if you're
any good, if you're or
if you're interested,
and if you're not interested,
you'll drop out and you'll
come up with something else.
Maybe you'll be an actor,
maybe you'll be a musician.
Whatever you want to do, he
goes, and if you're good at it
and you work hard,
you'll get better at it.
And you still might not get
discovered, but you'll be happy
doing it because you love doing
it.
And if you love doing it,
you'll keep doing it
and you'll get better.
And maybe somewhere
down the line you'll do
something, but just find out
first if you're any good
and if you love it because you
have to love it like that is
like the most amazing advice.
>> Awesome.
>> It's like he met, you know,
on the mountaintop, you know,
the guru said.
And so then here's how that
affects me in a weird way.
So this is my most recent book.
My book before it was
The Kids in the Hall: One Dumb
Guy, the Kids in the Hall were
in the same classes that I
went to because my brother
went to.
I met the Kids in the Hall
at Second City Workshops,
because Mike had gotten us all
to Second City workshops.
So when the Kids in the Hall
started taking off, we all knew
each other.
I wrote their book and then
I wrote the John Candy book.
So not only did it start
Mike's phenomenal career,
but my career in a weird way,
has also like I am now the guy
chronicling all those things.
>> This year would have marked
his 75th birthday.
John Candy passed away at 43.
Untimely.
What makes him such a revered
figure in Canadian pop culture
even to this day?
>> I think, for one thing, when
he was cut short of what he
could have done, he could have
gone into dramatic acting,
possibly directing, and maybe
more comedies.
Maybe he might have also
been in something like
Schitt's Creek
with his fellow SCTV people.
But the absence of John
persists.
People who knew him and knew
his work felt like they still
haven't resolved that loss.
At the same time,
what he represents in
his work values
that I think are hugely needed
today joy, empathy,
vulnerability.
He represented the so-called
common man with
with noble dignity.
Right.
Dan Aykroyd, by the way,
in the book, describes him
in these kinds of terms
all the time.
And those values in a film like
Cool Runnings, which, you know,
takes place at the Calgary
Olympics.
>> When you cross that
finish line.
Where do these guys come from?
>> You'll know.
>> He talks a lot about values
that we should, I think we
should all aspire to.
And, you know, there's
a lot of cruelty
in public policy in places
and in people's, you know,
social media.
When you see a character
who lived for empathy and joy
and his face is like a beacon
of that, he's twinkling eyes of
his.
So it's like, if you
didn't invent this character,
he didn't exist.
We'd have to make up
a fictional character
like this.
His face is a flag
for for joy, you know.
>> For fans who have followed
him throughout his career and
new fans who might be opening
this book and discovering,
you know, what a what a mogul
he was really for, for Canadians
here, what do you hope they
take away from his career?
>> He really tried to do films
that made people laugh, but he
was also good to people.
He was good when no one
was looking.
As a phrase that comes up a lot.
I hear that in a lot of other
people have said that, and I
think there was something about
you could be a big success and
still stay scaled one on one
with people.
And I mean, that's
definitely the lesson.
And also, I guess
for all Canadians on a
very specific level, you know,
representation matters.
I say that with a little bit
of facetiousness because,
yeah, another white guy.
But but the representation
of the goodness
and the values of Canadians
that we aspire to, even if it's
only aspirational, we want to
be better.
And we we have an icon here.
So that's a good
that's a good reason to
celebrate him.
>> I want to change gears
a little bit.
Okay.
Take a little bigger picture.
Comedy seems to be having
a moment right now
from the cancellation of The
Late Show with Stephen Colbert
to the suspension of Jimmy
Kimmel, about his comments
about Charlie Kirk to comedians
performing at the comedy
festival in Saudi Arabia.
Knowing what you know about
John Candy, what would he have
made about all of this that is
happening right now?
>> Oh, I, I have to preface
anything by saying I there's no
way, I presume, to speak for
John Candy at this point.
I don't even in the book
I talk about some of
his struggles, and I never
even analyse or judge
those like, you know, whatever.
However, he lived his life.
I can't walk a mile in
his shoes.
And I can tell you
that if somebody is getting a
hurt as a result of his comedy,
he wouldn't do it.
Based on anecdotal
what I've seen, I don't think
he would ever do cruel comedy
or punch down.
I think Jimmy Kimmel
would like him.
I think he would like
Jimmy Kimmel, like, you know,
those people who are, you know,
Seth Meyers, all those
comedians who are out there
being positive and and just
being enlightened.
I don't can't speak for him,
but I evidence evidence based.
He would have done something
positive.
>> You can't speak for him,
but you can speak for yourself.
So I'm going to ask you,
as a Canadian living in
the States, how do you make
a sense of what is happening?
>> It's tough.
And are they going to show this
when I enter the country again?
No.
And that and that answer
says it all.
I would say this.
I recently wrote an essay
called The Canadian Warman,
and in it I formulated
this view I have now.
I love my space in Northern
California that I live in
with my wife.
We're both Canadians,
but we both got us passports
because we wanted to engage
in civic politics.
There it was during the
Obama years, so don't get mad
at me anyway.
And so we booked tickets
on the S.S. Poseidon
before it flipped.
And and so I will tell you
that I always feel Canadian
everywhere I go.
So I am a Canadian because
I also feel a little bit
when I see the Republic
of California flag.
I feel a little bit of pride.
And when I see the governor
pushing back against
the president, I feel,
you know, our state is is
holding out, you know,
a little bit.
So if that changes,
I'll let you know.
But but I definitely
feel Canadian.
I feel super proud.
I was just at a writers
festival in Calgary,
and I was on panels talking
about the Canadian condition,
which is something we never
tire of talking about and
perhaps never should I, I want
to, I want Canada to be all the
cool things I like about Canada,
and it is home.
So and I'm not just saying
that because I'm here
in Toronto, you know,
I say that when I'm anywhere.
>> Paul, we're going to
leave it there.
Thank you so much.
>> Thank you.
It's really fun talking to you.
>> Yeah.
Thanks, guys.
We're building a new show.
We're also building
a whole new studio,
and there is a lot going on
behind the scenes.
Producer Diego Garcia
took his camera along
so you could take a peek
behind the curtain.
So we're off to 2200.
So we're in 2180.
We're going to another building,
which is our temporary studios,
where we do our cold opens,
where we start every piece.
Welcome to our temporary set.
>> The last two months, the
team has been working on a new
show called "The Rundown".
This has been
a very interesting process,
but also a little bit
crazy at times.
>> So this is Ricardo over here.
He's the man behind the camera.
This is where we do
our cold open.
So not what we wanted to do
when we launched our show,
but we found this open sort of
conference space.
We set up lights,
we do our cold open.
I'm not gonna lie,
it's a bit stressful.
Studio that is pretty much
a construction site,
and you've got it down to
the barebones.
It is quite a quite big space.
They're gonna have
an arched window like
loft windows here and then.
Yeah, a little nook
for a cold open.
This did not exist before.
So, yeah.
And you know, there's
challenges, obstacles
that come with a show.
This is not one
that we thought, but I'm super
proud of our team putting
it together.
And, yeah, putting a show
every night.
>> For our segment today
our guests will be calling in
over Zoom.
And during that time I will be
downstairs in the control room
making sure there's no sound
or technical issues.
And Jeyan will be in
his makeshift studio on a
different floor, and we'll be
connecting through a headset.
Then we have about 20 minutes
of a segment.
Hopefully we don't go too long.
>> Eric, anytime you first.

investigated white nationalists
active clubs in Canada.
Before we get into that
investigation with.
>> You, you can tell the amount
of work that he puts in daily
just to make sure everyone's

>> White nationalism is more
prevalent now than ever.
This is something that you.
>> Being able to start off with
"The Rundown" and see how a
show actually comes to life
for broadcast.
It's been such an educational
and cool experience.
>> I'm very thankful for
the team that we have.
It's the same team that's been
working on current affairs
programming at TVO.
They know we are all
professionals.
We know what we need to do
to get it on air.
And so here we are very excited.
>> He's honestly great to work
with and I'm very proud of him
and really happy that he's
gotten this new role.
>> Okay, we got some work to do.
As you just saw, our studio
is under construction
and so is our show.
We want you to help us
build it.
The show, of course,
not the studio.
So send your feedback and ideas
to www.tvo.org/rundownfeedback
and make your voice heard.
Until then, I'll see you
tomorrow.
