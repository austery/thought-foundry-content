- I'm Yuval Noah Harari.
I'm a professor of history,
at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem,
and the author of "Nexus,"
a history of information networks
from the Stone Age to AI.
The key question of "Nexus"
is if humans are so smart,
why are we so stupid?
Why are we on the verge
of destroying ourselves?
We have managed to reach the moon,
to split the atom, to the cipher DNA,
and yet with all our knowledge and wisdom,
we are on the verge of
ecological collapse,
perhaps of a third world war.
And also we are developing an extremely
powerful technology AI,
which might get out of our control
and enslave or destroy us.
So the book explores this strange dynamic
in human history between
our knowledge and wisdom
and our self-destructiveness.
And this is a question
that has been often raised
and a traditional theological
and mythological answer
to this question is that
there is something wrong
in human nature.
There is something in human nature
that makes us self-destructive,
and the answer that
"Nexus" gives is different.
The problem is not in our nature.
The problem is in our information.
Humans, yes, we are
generally good and wise,
but if you give good
people bad information,
they make bad decisions.
And what the book explores
is why is it that the quality
of our information did
not improve over thousands
of years of history?
Why is it that even modern,
very sophisticated societies
in the 20th and 21st century
have been as susceptible
as stone age tribes
to mass delusion and
psychosis and the rise
of destructive ideologies
like Stalinism or Nazism?
(graphics whooshing)
- [Announcer] Chapter one, the
rise of alien intelligence.
(graphics whooshing)
- Storytelling has always been important
from the stone age to the 21st century,
whenever a large number of people
are trying to cooperate on something,
whether it is to hunt a mammoth
or whether it is to build an atom bomb.
Just knowing the facts
about the objective world,
about objective reality is not enough.
If you want for instance,
to build an atom bomb,
you need to know some facts
about physical reality.
You need to know that e equals mc square.
If you try to build a bomb
and you ignore the facts of reality,
the bomb will not explode.
But just knowing facts is not enough
because in order to build an atom bomb,
you need millions of people
to cooperate on the project.
You need physicists to
write complicated equations,
but you also need miners to mine uranium.
In distant places around the world,
you need engineers and builders
to build the reactor and
the other facilities.
And you need farmers to grow
potatoes and rice, and wheat,
so that all the physicists,
and engineers, and builders,
and cleaners, and plumbers
in the nuclear facility
will have something to eat.
If they have to grow
themselves and grow potatoes
and then come back to the reactor
to do all their
experiments, it won't work.
So you need really hundreds of thousands,
if not millions of people
cooperating on that.
Now, if you just tell
them the facts of physics
that e equals mc square,
this is not going to motivate anybody
to cooperate on this project.
And this is where storytelling
comes into the picture.
So what really motivates people
is it could be religious stories,
mythologies and theologies.
It could be secular ideologies
like communism or capitalism.
And it's always the people who
are experts in storytelling
that give the orders to people
who merely know the
facts of nuclear physics.
So in Iran today, the nuclear scientists
are getting their orders from
experts in Shiite theology,
in the Soviet Union in the 1950s,
the experts in nuclear physics,
they got their orders from
experts in communist ideology.
And even in a completely
safe free market economy,
there are still stories at the basis
of the system because
money and corporations
are also stories that humans invented.
They are not physical facts.
If you consider, for
instance, a dollar bill,
it has no objective value whatsoever,
at least not for human beings.
Maybe termites can eat it,
but humans can't eat dollars,
they can't drink them.
There is nothing useful
you can do with them.
They nevertheless have value
because the greatest
storytellers in the world,
the finance ministers, the
bankers, the investors,
they tell us a story that this
piece of paper is has value.
I can use it to buy bread or potatoes
or bananas or anything else.
And as long as millions of
people believe in this story,
they are willing to work, for instance,
on constructing and nuclear reactor
because at the end of the month,
they get these few
colorful pieces of paper.
And today, of course, it's not even paper.
Most of the money in the
world today is not paper notes
and metal coins.
It's just digital information
moving between computers.
But as long as people still have trust
in the story about these
digital information, it works.
People are willing to work
hard for a whole month
or a whole year just in
order to get a few bits
of data in their bank account.
When we think about this kind of meeting
between storytelling,
which is a very ancient human capacity,
going back tens of thousands of years,
and the new technology of AI,
I don't think we should start
with words like risk,
or threat, or danger.
It's better to just understand the immense
importance of what is happening right now.
Throughout history, for
tens of thousands of years,
the only entities that
could invent stories,
whether stories about gods,
or stories about money were human beings.
So we lived cocooned
inside a cultural world
constructed by the human imagination.
If you read a holy book, or if
you read an economic theory,
or if you listen to a song
or you listen to a piece of music,
this came out of the mind
of another human being.
So we lived in a human world.
Now, for the first time in history,
there is another entity.
There is another agent out
there that can create stories,
economic theories, new
kinds of currencies, music,
poems, images, videos,
and this new entity is AI.
What happens to human society?
What happens to human life if
we increasingly live our lives
cocooned inside the cultural artifacts
coming from non-human intelligence,
from an alien intelligence.
And you know, the acronym AI
traditionally stood for
artificial intelligence,
but I think it's more accurate
to think about it as an
acronym for alien intelligence
because artificial, it
gives the impression
that this is an artifact
that we create and control,
and AI with every passing year,
AI is becoming less and less artificial
and more and more alien
in the sense that we can't
predict what kind of new stories
and ideas and strategies
it'll come up with.
It thinks it behaves in a
fundamentally alien way.
I give two examples to clarify this,
because there is a huge
confusion around AI today.
There is so much hype around
AI, especially in the market.
If you want to sell
something to people today,
you call it AI.
So everything now becomes AI
and then people don't understand.
So what is it?
And if you think, let's say about
somebody's trying to
sell you a coffee machine
and they tell you this
is an AI coffee machine,
how do you know what what it
means and whether it's true?
Not every automatic machine is an AI.
If this coffee machine,
you press a button,
let's say for espresso,
and the machine produces,
provides you with a cup of
espresso, this is not AI.
It simply follows the
pre-programmed orders
of its human creators, the hallmark of AI.
What makes AI, AI is that it
is able to learn and change
by itself and come up
with decisions and ideas
that we don't anticipate can't anticipate.
So if you approach the coffee machine,
and the coffee machine
before you press any button
tells you, "Hi, hello,
I've been watching you for the last month
and based on all the
information I gathered on you
and on many other users,
and based on the time of day
and your facial expression or whatever,
I predict that you now want an espresso.
So I took the liberty to already prepare
for you a cup of espresso."
This is an AI.
And if now it goes a
step further and says,
"I actually invented a new drink
that you've never tasted
before, I call it bestpreso.
And I also took the liberty
to prepare it for you because
I think you would like it."
This is an AI coffee machine.
And this is not just theory,
it's also we are seeing it all around us.
One of the key moments in the
AI revolution back in 2016,
was when AlphaGo defeated the Lee Sedol,
the world champion at the game of Go.
Go is a strategy board game
much more complex than chess
invented more than 2000
years ago in China,
and it became a cultural
treasure in East Asia.
For more than 2000 years,
tens of millions of people
in East Asia played Go,
and entire schools of
thought entire philosophies
evolved around this
game because it was seen
as a mirror for life and
as a good preparation
for politics and for making
decisions in the world.
And people thought that
we know how to play Go
and AlphaGo taught itself how to play Go.
And within a few weeks
surpassed the wisdom accumulated
by humanity by tens of millions
of people over more than 2000 years.
The most amazing thing about its victory
was that it used a strategy
which was considered beyond the pale.
When it played its crucial moves,
Go experts were didn't understand,
what is it nobody plays Go like that.
And it turned out to be
a brilliant strategy.
And it also turned out that
for more than 2000 years,
our human minds have explored
only a very limited part
of the landscape of Go.
If you imagine all the
ways you can play Go
as a kind of planet with a geography.
So humans were stuck on one island
in the planet Go for more than 2000 years,
because human minds just couldn't conceive
of going beyond this small island.
And then AI came along and
within a very brief time,
it discovered entire new
continents on the planet Go.
And this is likely to happen
in more and more fields,
in finance, in art,
in politics, in religion.
So before we think about
it in terms of risks
or threat or opportunity.
Just think what it would
mean to live on a planet
which is increasingly
shaped by the stories
and the products of an alien intelligence.
(graphics whooshing)
- [Announcer] Chapter two,
how information technology shapes society.
- Every time there is a
new information technology
was invented, it
completely changed society,
politics, culture.
About 5,000 years ago, one of
the most important revolutions
in information technology occurred
with the invention of writing.
Now, from a technical perspective,
it didn't seem like much,
because to invent the
invention of writing,
and we are in ancient
Mesopotamia, what is today Iraq,
about 5,000 years ago.
It basically involves mud and a stick.
People started taking clay tablets,
and clay is just essentially mud.
And they take a stick, a
read, and they imprint signs
on the clay tablet and then
preserve the clay tablet.
And this is document,
this preserves records of various things.
So this is the invention of
writing people playing with mud.
And this had immense impact.
So to give again just one
example, think about ownership.
What does it mean to own something?
Let's say I have a field.
What does it mean that this field is mine?
So if you live in ancient Mesopotamia
or anywhere else in the
world before writing,
ownership means a communal
agreement among my neighbors,
the people in my village
that this field is mine.
So they don't graze their goats there,
and they don't pick fruits
there without my permission.
But because ownership means
an agreement of the community,
it limits the power of the individual.
I can't sell my field to someone else
unless I get the agreement of my neighbors
because they decide who owns what field.
It also means that a distant
king in some capital city,
a thousand kilometers away,
he can't know who owns what
because there are no records
and he can't know what each field
in each village belongs to whom.
So it makes it very
difficult to tax property,
which makes it very difficult
to build large kingdoms and empires.
Then mud comes along writing,
you have these clay tablets,
suddenly to own a field
means that there is a piece
of dry mud somewhere with
some signs on it, which says,
this field is mine.
And this means that
now I can sell my field
to someone without getting the
permission of my neighbors,
because to transfer the
field to that other person
in exchange for, I don't
know, a couple of some gold,
I don't need the agreement
of the neighbors.
I just give the person this
piece of clay, of dry mud.
This is ownership.
It also means that the
king in the distant capital
can now create an archive
of all the property records
in lots and lots of villages.
And know he has bureaucrats
who know how to read these clay tablets.
They know who owns each field.
In numerous villages,
you can start to have taxation systems.
You can start have kingdoms and empires.
So paradoxically,
in this case there are
many other influences.
But in this case, the invention
of the written document,
it on the one hand empowers
the individual and creates
the basis for private property rights
and creates the basis for large
scale authoritarian systems
of kingdoms and empires.
We jumped 5,000 years
from ancient Mesopotamia
to the 20th century.
The rise of mass media, and
mass information technology,
telegraph, and radio, and television.
On the one hand, they now form the basis
for large scale democratic systems.
And on the other hand, for large
scale totalitarian systems,
before the rise of modern
information technology,
it was impossible to create
either large scale democracies,
or large scale totalitarian regimes.
Totalitarian regimes, meaning
regimes that try to control
the totality of people's lives.
Ancient kings in Mesopotamia,
or Roman emperors,
or Chinese emperors, they
had a very limited capacity
to collect information on
the people in their kingdom.
So yes, they raised taxes
and they used the taxes
to pay for soldiers and build armies,
but they could not micromanage
the social, and economic,
and cultural lives of every
individual in the country.
They didn't have the
information necessary to do it.
Large scale totalitarianism
appears in the 20th century
for the first time in the Soviet Union
after the Bolshevik Revolution.
And it's based on exactly
the same technology
that at exactly the same
time leads to the rise
of the first mass democracies
in the United States
and the United Kingdom and
other places around the world.
(graphics whooshing)
- [Announcer] Chapter three,
the rise of inorganic information.
- All information technologies
up to the 21st century
were organic networks
because it ultimately,
it was all based on our organic brain
and this had a lot of implications.
Organic entities are live by cycles.
We run by cycles.
Sometimes it's day, sometimes it's night,
there is winter and summer.
There is growth and decay,
there are times for activity.
And then there are times
for sleep and for rest.
All information networks
previously in history,
they had these cycles.
Even if you think about
the financial markets,
think about Wall Street.
Wall Street also obeyed until
today, this organic logic,
the market is open only
Mondays to Fridays,
9:30 in the morning I think,
until four o'clock in the afternoon.
And then the weekend is off.
And this is how organic beings function,
even bankers and investors and financiers,
as long as they are
humans and not algorithms,
they need time to rest,
and they need time to be with their family
and with their friends.
So the market take rests.
And another thing is that
there is always time off
and there is always,
therefore also private time.
Until the rise of AI Even
the most totalitarian regimes
like in the Soviet Union,
they could not monitor,
they could not surveil
everybody all the time.
The Soviet Union did not
have enough KGB agents
to follow every Soviet
citizen 24 hours a day.
And even if you somehow managed
to follow all the people all the time,
they didn't have analysts, enough analysts
to go over all the information
and make sense of it.
Even if a KGB agent saw you do something
and wrote a report about it,
there was a very high chance
that this report will just
accumulate dust in the archives
of the KGB because it
didn't have enough analysts
to read millions and millions of reports
written every day about
all Soviet citizens.
So organic information networks,
they always run by cycles.
There is always time to rest,
and there is always a measure of privacy.
So we now see the rise of a new
type of information network,
which is inorganic, which is based on AI.
It need not have any
breaks, it never rests,
and there is no privacy potentially
it could completely annihilate privacy.
Computers, they don't
care if it's night or day,
if it's summer or winter,
they don't need vacations,
they don't have families
they want to spend time with.
They are always on.
And therefore they might
force us to be always on,
always being watched,
always being monitored.
And this is destructive for
organic animals like ourselves.
If you force an organic
being to be on all the time,
it eventually collapses and dies.
And we see it happening all around us
with a 24 hours new
cycle that never rests.
The markets never rest,
politics never rest.
So the people involved
in these occupations,
they can never really rest
and this takes a toll on them.
It's very, very difficult and
will soon become impossible.
Anything you do or say at any time
might be watched and recorded
and then it can meet you down
the line 10 or 20 years in the future.
You do something stupid but
legal in a college party today,
when you are 18, maybe in 20 years,
when you run for political office
or you want to be a judge
or whatever, it's there.
So basically the whole of life
is becoming like one long job interview.
Anything you do at any moment
is part of your job
interview 20 years from now.
Now, all this is made
possible by the fact that AI
is the first technology in history
that can take decisions by itself.
Until today, all our big
information networks,
they were managed, they were populated
by human bureaucrats, whether
it's government offices
or corporations, or armies,
or banks or schools.
All the decisions
ultimately have to be made
by a organic brain of a human being.
Now, AI has the capacity to
make decisions by itself.
So what we are facing is not, you know,
like a Hollywood science fiction scenario
of one big evil computer
trying to take over the world.
No, it's nothing like that.
It's more like millions and
millions of AI bureaucrats
that are given more and more authority
to make decisions about us in banks,
in armies, in governments.
And again, there is good
potential in that as well.
They can provide us with the
best healthcare in history.
But there are of course,
huge risks when power shifts
from organic humans to
these alien inorganic AIs.
It just becomes more and
more difficult for us
to understand the decisions
that shape our life.
What happens if you can
no longer understand
why the bank refused to give you a loan,
why the government or the
army did this or did that?
And this is the world
that we are entering.
A curious fact is that at
least in the United States,
there is already a legal path open for AIs
to become legal persons, because in the US
unlike in other countries
around the world,
corporations are considered legal persons
that even have rights
like freedom of speech.
Now, until today, this was
a kind of legal fiction
because a corporation like Google
could not make any decisions.
Only the humans employed by
Google made all the decisions.
But now AI can make decisions by itself.
So what happens if you
now incorporate an AI,
you go through this legal process
that you incorporate an AI,
and I dunno, you call it Boole,
now it's the Boole corporation.
It has no human employees,
it's run by an AI
and it is now a legal person
that according to US law,
has a lot of rights and freedoms.
So for instance, it can
open a bank account,
corporations open bank accounts.
Why can't the AI do
it? It's a corporation.
It can earn money,
it can go online to
websites like TaskRabbit
and offer its services to clients,
human or non-human, and earn money.
And then it takes its money and invest it.
And because it's so good at
making investment decisions,
it earns billions and billions.
We could be in a situation
when the richest person
in the United States is not a human being.
The richest person in the United States
is an a incorporated AI.
And another thing that
the US legal system allows
is for these legal persons
to make political donations
because it's considered
part of freedom of speech.
So now this, the richest person in the US
is giving billions of
dollars to candidates
in exchange for these
candidates broadening
the rights of AIs, the legal path to this.
This is no longer kind of
a science fiction scenario.
The legal and practical path
to this situation is open.
(graphics whooshing)
- [Announcer] Chapter four,
the importance of human institutions.
- To deal with the era of AI.
It should be clear that
we cannot anticipate
how this technology will develop
over the next few decades.
So it's impossible to kind of
think about all the dangers
in advance and regulate
against them or whatever.
What we need is living
institutions staffed
by the best human talent and with access
to the best technology that
will be at the cutting edge
of the technological development
and will be able to identify
and react to dangers and
threats as they arise.
So I'm not talking about
rigid regulation in advance,
I'm talking about the
need for new institutions
because you can never rely on just,
the letter of the law or on
a charismatic individual,
some genius to do it.
In history humans, again and
again encounter these problems
and it always goes back to the
same solution institutions.
And in good institutions,
they are characterized
by having strong
self-correcting mechanisms.
A self-correcting mechanism is a mechanism
that allows entity, a
human being, an animal,
or an institution to identify
and correct its own mistakes.
You don't have to rely on the environment,
on something out there
to correct your mistakes.
You can correct your own mistakes.
This is a basic feature of
any functioning organism.
Like how does a child learns to walk?
Yes, the child gets some
instruction from parents,
from teachers, but mostly
it's self-connection.
You try to to walk, you
fall down, you get up again,
you try something else,
you again fall down,
you get up again, and step
by step you learn how to walk
by identifying and
correcting your own mistakes.
And this goes all the
way to entire countries.
This is the heart
of democratic systems
is this self-correcting.
What are elections?
Elections are a self-correcting mechanism.
You give power to a certain
party or individual.
Let's try your policies,
after some time if you
think you made a mistake,
this was the wrong policy,
this was the wrong party,
you can say, I made a mistake.
There are another round of elections.
We made a mistake last time,
let's try something else this time.
In dictatorships,
there is no such
self-correcting mechanism.
If Putin or Maduro makes
a terrible mistake,
there is no mechanism within Russia today
that can identify and
correct Putin's own mistakes.
When we come to the challenge
of AI, what we need,
our institutions that are
able to identify and correct
their mistakes and the mistakes of AI
as the technology develops.
Another important example
of self-correcting mechanism
is the way that modern science works.
In contrast to traditional
religions, traditional religions,
they were characterized by claiming
to be infallible that their holy book,
their sacred tradition
never makes any mistake
and therefore you cannot.
There is no mechanism, for
instance, in Christianity
of Judaism to identify and
correct mistakes in the Bible.
I'm not talking just about,
you know, factual mistakes,
also moral mistakes.
The Bible, the 10
Commandments for instance,
endorses slavery.
The 10th commandment says,
that you should not covet
your neighbors field
or your neighbors ox, or
your neighbors slaves.
According to the 10th commandment,
God has no problem with
people owning slaves
he just has a problem with people
coveting the slaves of somebody else.
No, no, no, no, no. That's not good.
Now, even today, with all
everything that have changed
since these words were written
in the first millennia, BCE,
there is no mechanism to
correct the text of the Bible.
You can interpret them in different ways,
but you can't change the text.
This in contrast to what
we find both in science
and in modern democracies.
The US Constitution originally
also enabled slavery,
but the US Constitution also
had an amendment mechanism,
a self-correcting mechanism
that eventually the people
of the United States amended
the Constitution to forbid slavery.
And then science works in an analogous way
that if you have a theory
of how the planets move,
or how organisms evolve,
the whole of science really is
a self-correcting mechanism.
The only thing that
scientific journals publish
are corrections to previous publications.
In religious publications, no,
they publish again and
again the same teachings.
But in academic journals, in
history or physics or medicine,
they never publish the same thing twice.
The only thing they
publish is corrections,
either to pass mistakes or past lacuna.
If there is something
in the theory of Newton,
which is either incomplete or mistaken,
then they will publish
Einstein's correction
to Newton's physics.
Every large scale human system is based
on an unlikely marriage between
mythology and bureaucracy.
If you think about a country for instance,
so mythology explains the rationale,
why should the country even exist?
Every country to convince its own citizens
why it should exist, tells
them some kind of national
or religious mythology like
we are God's chosen people
and we have some very
special role here on earth.
So this is the mythology part.
It gives the motivation,
the inspiration, the reason,
but then to actually have
a functioning country,
it's not enough if the citizens
believe in the mythology
that they are God's chosen people
with some mission on earth.
You also need to build roads,
and hospitals, and armies,
and sewage systems.
You know, no large scale
city, at least a modern city
if you want to avoid epidemics
can function without a sewage system.
And in order to build a sewage system,
so you need a lot of workers and engineers
and you need to pay them.
So you need to collect
taxes from the citizens
in order to build a sewage system.
So again, here mythology
comes back into the picture,
the mythology encourages
people or explains to people
why they should pay their taxes honestly,
so that other citizens in our country
will enjoy good healthcare
services and a good sew system
that protects us from
cholera and so forth.
Again, when I talk about
national mythologies,
so it should be clear that
there is nothing wrong about it.
Nationalism and patriotism
have been one of the most,
one of the best inventions
in human history.
Most other social mammals,
all other social mammals actually,
they care only about a
small circle of animals
that they know personally
they have intimate connection with.
And this was also true
for our human ancestors
hundreds of thousands of years ago.
The miracle of nationalism and patriotism
is that it makes us scare
about millions of strangers
that we have never met in our lives.
And again, nationalism is
not about hating foreigners
and wanting to kill the others.
It's about loving our compatriots
and showing this love,
for instance, by paying taxes honestly,
so that other people in the country
will be defended against cholera
by building a sewage system.
(graphics whooshing)
- [Announcer] Chapter five,
information isn't truth.
- The biggest misconception
about information
is that information is truth
and information isn't truth.
Most information is not truth.
The truth is a very rare and costly
and expensive type of information.
If you want truth, you need
to invest a lot in getting it.
I'll give an example, historical example.
Let's think about images and portraits.
What is the most common
portrait in the world?
What is the most famous face in the world?
It is Jesus.
There over the last 2000 years,
people have created billions and billions
of portraits of Jesus.
And they are hung in countless
churches and cathedrals
and private homes and so forth.
And not a single one of them
is an authentic depiction of Jesus.
They are all, 100% of them
are fictional depictions
because we have no idea
how Jesus looked like,
there is not a single portrait
made during his lifetime.
There is not a single
sentence in the Bible
that tells us whether he was fat or thin,
tall or short, black hair,
blonde hair, nothing.
So all these images, they're fiction.
And it's very easy to
create fictional information
because you don't need
to research anything.
You don't need evidence.
You just come up with
something and draw it.
If you want to paint a truthful picture
of anything, of a person,
of an economy, of a war,
you need to invest a
lot of time and effort
and money to research to make
sure that you get it right.
So if we just flood the
world with information
and expect the truth to float
up, it'll not, it'll sink.
The more we flood the
world with information,
unless we make the effort
to construct institutions
that invest in truth,
we'll be flooded by fiction
and illusion and delusion
and junk information.
So most information is not
truth and most information,
what it tries to do is gain
power by creating order,
not by spreading the truth.
If you want millions of people
to cooperating on something,
the easiest way to do it is to create
some fictional mythology or ideology
and convince a lot of
people to believe in it.
And the way to do it is to bombard them
with more and more stories
and images and so forth
of your favorite mythology or ideology.
And this is how you gain power.
And you need to know some truth.
Again, a system that is
completely oblivious to truth,
it'll collapse of course,
but in this balance,
how much truth do you
need in order to construct
the Soviet Union and how
much fiction and delusions
do you need in order to
construct the Soviet Union?
You need a little truth
and a lot of fiction.
And this is true of
most of the large scale
political systems that existed
throughout human history,
we tend to think about
totalitarianism and democracy
as different ethical systems,
but they are different
information networks.
Information flows differently
in totalitarian versus
democratic networks.
Totalitarian networks are centralized,
all the information
flows to just one place
where all the decisions are being made,
and they lack strong
self-correcting mechanisms.
There is no mechanism in the Soviet Union
to identify and correct
the mistakes of Stalin.
Democracies in contrast,
they are distributed information networks
with lots of self-correcting mechanisms.
The decisions in the United States
are not made only in Washington.
Just a small part of all
decisions are made there.
Most decisions are made
by private businesses,
and voluntary associations,
and individuals, and so forth.
And there are lots of mechanisms
to correct the mistakes
even of the most powerful
politicians and corporations.
So this is the key difference
in terms of information flow
between totalitarianism and democracy.
In the 20th century,
totalitarian systems work worse
than democratic systems.
When all the information
flowed to just one place,
just to Moscow, the people
there were overwhelmed
by all the flood of information
and they could not make
the right decisions
and there was no mechanism
to correct their mistakes.
And eventually the system collapsed.
A distributed information system
was much better when the decision
makers were human beings.
But AI could give an advantage
to totalitarian systems
in the 21st century, why?
Because AI can process
enormous amount of information
much faster and more efficiently
than any communist bureaucrat.
When you flood a human
with too much information,
the human collapses.
When you flood an AI with information,
the AI becomes better.
So there is a scenario that
it's not deterministic,
it's not certain, but there is a scenario
that totalitarian systems
will become better
in the 21st century because of AI.
Still the other problem
of totalitarian systems
that they have no
self-correcting mechanisms.
This is still applicable
even in the age of AI.
It makes it even more dangerous.
A totalitarian system relying on AI
that the AI makes a mistake.
AIs are fallible, AIs are
not God. They make mistakes.
If you give all the power
to a totalitarian AI
and you have no way to
correct its mistakes,
this could prove catastrophic
to the entire human civilization.
For human dictators, AI is
an especially big problem
because for an AI to take
power in a dictatorship
is much, much easier than to
kidnap power in a democracy.
Because all power in a dictatorship
is already concentrated
in the hands of just one paranoid leader.
The AI needs to learn how to manipulate
just this single individual in order
to take power in the country.
So the danger of AI
taking power in a country
are much bigger in
dictatorships than in democracy.
In democracy, a big
problem is very different.
Democracy is a conversation.
The the whole meaning for democracy
is that you have large numbers of people
conversing about the issues of the day.
Now imagine a large group of people
standing in a circle and talking,
and suddenly a group of
robots entering the circle
and start talking very loudly
and very emotionally, and persuasively
and you can't tell the difference
who is a human and who is a robot.
That is a situation we
are now living through,
and it is no coincidence that
the democratic conversation
is breaking down all over the world
because the algorithms are hijacking it.
We have the most sophisticated
information technology
in history and we are losing the ability
to talk with each other to
hold a reasoned conversation.
In order to protect the
conversation between people,
we need to ban bots from the conversation.
We need to ban fake humans.
AIs should be welcome to talk with us
only if they identify as AIs.
If you talk online with
someone and you don't know
whether it's an AI or a human,
this will destroy the
democratic conversation.
So we need to ban that.
If we want to ensure
that we get the truth.
The only way to do it is
to invest in institutions
like academic research institutions,
like newspapers that invest
a lot of effort in finding the truth.
If we just expect that
a flood of information
will bring us the truth, it'll not.
It'll overwhelm the rare and
costly kind of information,
which is truth, by a deluge
of fake and junk information.
And as individuals, my best recommendation
is to go on an information diet,
the same way that people go on food diets.
Information is the food of the mind.
We have learned that
it's not good to our body
to eat too much food
or too much junk food.
So lots of people are very mindful
what they feed their body.
We should be equally mindful
about what we feed our mind.
More information isn't
always good for you,
it's actually good from time to time,
take time for information fasts.
When we don't put anything more in,
we just digest and detoxify.
And similarly, we should watch the quality
of the information we feed our mind.
If we feed our mind with
all this junk information
full of greed, and hate, and
fear, we will have sick minds.
