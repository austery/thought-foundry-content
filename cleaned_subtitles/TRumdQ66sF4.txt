hi everybody tune in to this short version of the podcast which we do every Friday for the long version tune in on Wednesdays hi everyone today we have the great pleasure of having Peter Harrison on the show Peter is the CEO of schroers one of the biggest asset managers in Europe and amazingly shos has been in business for nearly or for roughly 200 years Peter great to have you here thank you great pleasure only 45 out of 1 million companies exist for 100 years and you've been doing it for 200 years well the what's the trick so I think the the key is committed ownership we've got a family backing who takes a 20e view of where we need to go and and because of that the business has changed and evolved and the we've been in lots of different businesses in the finance sector throughout that time but we've continued to change and I think that's only possible if you've got a committed long-term ownership structure which allows that change if we do the last 10 years what are the biggest changes you've seen in Investment Management huge yeah so massive growth of passive management huge growth towards privates um a collapse in fees so just to for the for the listeners uh private is like private Equity passive is index funds absolutely and and and private debt the world the world is moving away from public companies towards private companies um a a revolution in governance huge agenda on climate um collapse in fees so wholesale CH the industry is going through a major disruption why are the Americans doing better are the Americans working harder are they clever what is it no no they're not they're not working harder they're not clever but they do have some innate advantages of of scale to start with they had more partnership type structures which I think is is is a very good structure in an asset management business um because you're sharing 100% of the pie with with people in the business rather than a portion of the pie and I think we've also seen this very big change of the growth of privates and and in private markets the big bigger you are the bigger the mod how does the kind of the decline of the UK Capital Market play in here so if you go back go back 15 years the UK has one of the largest pools of domestic Savings in the world yeah and we regulated that out of existence so it basically bought government bonds and and stopped taking risk and we put consumer protection at the center and that Shrunk the UK as as an equity Market considerably saw huge outflows over the last 15 years and then we put in a corporate governance codee which said conflict between shareholders and companies is a good thing and everything every League table was the more times you vote against management the better and those two things were were unhelpful for listings they were unhelpful for thriving domestic Capital those are now changing and people are are going back towards more risk-taking they're going back to more constructive environment so the the listed Market has has struggled I think what's happened at the same time is London has boomed with private Market markets with hedge funds um as a center for you know people coming together we've got some fantastic Life Sciences the problem is it's being it's foreign Capital which is driving those businesses not domestic Capital so the returns are not going to UK Savers and I think as a country that's a big problem what hases brexit did to this well brexit was just it undermined two things it undermined confidence in the UK as a place to make long-term decisions and it created two or three years of complete Hiatus and then you after brexit you had Boris government Boris Johnson's government you had a whole set of challenges around list trust's budget and the guilts crisis all of a sudden the UK as a serious counterpart and a place to invest started to decline we've started to see that correct but but say scars take a while to heal is there um a danger that in order to attract companies you loosen up on the rules and regulations to the extent that it becomes you know uh Wild West well that's that's the argument that a lot of people will make the the other question is if you take no risk you don't get a return and so I I think the the answer is you you have a set of rules and if companies abide by those rules they can list in the UK and then it's for active managers to choose which they want to own and which they don't want to own and and I think the UK has always been good at active risk-taking and I think you slightly careful that you don't set a set of rules which are so prohibitive that no one wants to be here and that's where we were 5 years ago that that's changed do we need a unified European Equity Capital Market yeah and will will we get it no AI how is that going to change the way you do things everything in what way everything well I think it fundamentally changes the landscape of the companies we invest in in the very short term we will spend a lot of time trying to do things better in the probably far more quickly than we realize we will find we do things very very very differently and the moment we're all thinking about the better bit but actually the real change will come from when we do it differently so I think the first place we'll see a major Chang is in wealth because my sense is that people will turn to their beautiful AI assistant who will become who will know them better than anybody and ask them for wealth advice in a way that they currently ask people and I I don't believe our portfolio managers are in different from any other industry if we can if if AI is helping understand the human genome back backwards the microbiome backwards it can certainly help you make become a better investor and I think it's beholden on us to make sure those tools and that data is in front of our portfolio managers when they make decisions now you are on how to build good teams how to build good teams yeah so how do you build good teams first thing you you need brilliant leaders of those teams you need to give them great tools they need to be the right size they need to be near their local markets um and you need to give them space to get things wrong because great investors don't get it right every single day then they might be wrong for three or four years at a time and you've got to be willing to put your arms around them and support them but the critical thing is you understand the risk to take and they're good Risk Takers and you and you got your head around who is managing their way through that and the path dependency of returns and what kind of leader are you well I I've discovered that I'm I'm a connecting with the organization and trying to drive the hearts of the organization as much as the minds of the organization has been ended up being being the style that that I've done I I'm passionate about Innovation I'm I spent my time paid my way through University Writing code so I'm a bit of a geek so for me the the getting the Innovation being really consistent about your strategic Vision just being resilient and not be banged off course um but making sure you take the organization with you because the problem in most businesses is the huge layers of permafrost that don't think change has got anything to do with them and how do you bring those people through and and create those new capabilities how do you melt permafrost I think culture change the so so great great teams right is a difference between a between a good company and a great company and and and great leaders within those teams will will drive that change but you need to shine daylight into dark Corners it's the best disinfectant have you been bold enough so I if I look back what's the thing I wish I'd done more of is be more bold and in what ways should you have been more bold so we should have done more private markets earlier because compounding up we should have probably been more willing to acquire more teams and not do as much organically um and I think I look back the things you have acquired quite a lot we have acquired quite a lot but we acquired small because I didn't want to destroy the culture yeah and so for me because the challenge I think is that public market culture and private Market culture are really different and can you get them to coexist in the same organization successfully is is hard and that was the thing which you've seen ruin many companies and I so said we're going to we're going to work really hard at this but we're going to go slowly with hindsight the disruption in our industry has been way quicker yeah than anyone thought what do you make of the recent swing in appetite for ESG well first thing to say it's been politicized so that's so you've seen this huge Geographic diversion yeah um and you've you you absolutely have passed Peak debate I mean so a lot of people don't want to talk about it now and you've seen it but I think in boardrooms and people's awareness of the importance of climate I don't think that's debated at all so what companies are getting on and doing is very real it's just people spend a lot less time talking about it in a world with increased geopolitical frictions between the US and China for instance um what are the dilemas of being a large player in China for you well it's really interesting isn't it most us players have stopped talking about their Chinese investments in their in their public statements but they haven't pulled back from their activities on the ground because this is one of the largest savings markets in the world it's a huge you know it's it's second only to the US have you stopped talking about it or no we've we we've said very open about it what do you read a lot what one of one of the greatest privileges is is I'm a judge of the Ft book of the year so I read a lot of books about about business so I'm my anything which is about society today for me so so a brilliant book just out the longevity imperative that says we've get we're getting ourselves thinking about longevity completely the wrong way um Jonathan Height's book about the impact of mobile technology on children you know the the stuff ravenous about about Food Systems being broken around the world those are the really big issues I think we Face come on give us some more titles you read all these W Supremacy on on AI you Amy ederson was was our winner last year which you you you obviously covered in your podcast which was was a brilliant book on on learning from failure and I think there's so much great I mean there's so many brilliant books being written I just don't have enough time to read them I agre
