Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
In the previous video
We explored in depth
Spanning Chinese history and contemporary times
"Witch hunter mentality"
We can find
Whether it was political criticism during the Cultural Revolution
Or the nationalist fervor on the internet today?
They all share a common underlying layer.
Ancient witchcraft logic:
It presupposes a passive, pure,
A self that is easily contaminated
as well as
A hostile
and the external world of evil forces
This way of thinking
The pursuit of an unattainable purity
This will inevitably lead to the unlimited expansion of the enemy.
Ultimately, all social trends
They were all dragged into an endless exorcism ritual.
In the midst of internal strife
Today, people no longer mention demons and monsters.
But he will target foreign forces and capital.
Concepts such as nuclear radiation
It is also considered to be omnipresent and all-pervasive.
Infiltrating at all times
and the evil entities that pollute us
At the end of the last video
We also concluded that
underdeveloped subjectivity
It is the root cause of all superstition.
And this superstition
It relies on simply popularizing scientific knowledge.
Unchangeable
This is also something that top-down education cannot do.
A fragile subject
Even if you master science
It may also involve the scientific concept itself.
Becoming the new demon in your own paranoia
This conclusion, although it sounds profound...
But it also directly challenges a kind of
We are very familiar with
And it seems to be the most reasonable viewpoint
When we are on social media
Seeing the violence in Chinese society
Statements lacking common sense
Or see a group of people
For an absurd reason
When besieging an individual
One of the most common reactions is
Lamenting the lack of wisdom
Many people will subconsciously
These issues
Attributable to a lack of education
They would say,
This is because in China's basic education
There is a lack of a proper "logic" course.
Or rather, this is because
The proportion of people with a bachelor's degree in China is still too low.
Many people still lack basic scientific literacy.
and common sense in modern society
However, behind this viewpoint
Actually, an optimism is hidden within.
and simple beliefs
Ignorance is simply a lack of knowledge.
Irrational fanaticism
This can be achieved through the popularization of knowledge.
Healing through thought reform
His subtext is
Just wait patiently
Popularize more science of logic in the classroom
Or common sense in modern society
or
As more and more people improve their education level
All problems will naturally be solved.
So, this video...
Let's discuss this in detail.
An individual who appears to have mastered modern knowledge
Why in collective frenzy
They will lose their own judgment.
Why simply popularize knowledge?
It is not the fundamental guarantee of subjectivity
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
Actually, what we say
The root cause of superstition
The problem lies in the underdevelopment of subjectivity
Rather than simply a lack of scientific knowledge
This is in the history of ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad.
There are numerous examples.
For example, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution
It can be considered as two games
Large-scale modern superstitious activities
During the Great Leap Forward
It is everywhere in the country
"Breaking down superstitions"
"Emancipate the mind"
"Man can conquer nature"
slogans, etc.
It looks full of modernity.
The colors of rationality and science
However in practice
But it is moving towards something more than ancient China
It will develop in an even more regressive direction.
People no longer believe
Land has its own objective laws.
Instead, believe
Revolutionary will can directly command nature
It is integrated with nature.
Thus, the slogan of "10,000 catties per mu" resounded throughout the sky.
In order to "prove" this myth
People planted rice on dozens of acres of land
Uproot
They were planted densely in an acre of land.
Photo published in newspaper
Presenting gifts to superiors
This model field was blessed by revolutionary fervor.
Soon it will become stuffy due to lack of ventilation.
It rotted and died because it was opaque.
But that's not important.
The important thing is
Through this ceremony
People proved to the leader
One’s loyalty and revolutionary passion
And this passion
How does it possess the magic to change the world?
However
This is similar to how officials in ancient China tried to please the emperor.
The act of vying to present auspicious omens
There is not much difference.
For example, the Mahjong-hunting Campaign in 1956
His logic seems very scientific:
Sparrows eating grain is harmful.
Therefore, eliminate sparrows
Grain production will increase.
This is a simple...
Linear causal chain
However, this way of thinking
Completely ignoring the complexity of ecosystems
Ignoring the fact that sparrows also eat pests
This fact
It took the sparrow
It was defined as a pure "pest".
And "enemy"
Then
A people's war with full mobilization
To give it a thorough cleaning
This is essentially a kind of "exorcism ritual".
The aim is to eliminate a identified demon.
Keep the people in a state
The state of fighting the devil
for example
There was a famous ballad at that time
This is what it says:
The rat is treacherous, the sparrow is wicked.
Flies and mosquitoes are like rightists
Sucking human blood attracts disease.
Stealing someone's happiness and causing destruction
The game of playing mahjong did not take this into consideration.
Sparrows not only eat grain
And it also eats pests.
Mass extermination of sparrows
This resulted in pests having no natural enemies.
And indirectly led to
Next year's grain harvest will be poor
And the Great Famine
It is worth mentioning
At that time, Qian Xuesen and Hua Luogeng
And writers such as Ba Jin
They also actively participated in the mahjong game.
The People's Daily also reported on this.
Chinese Academy of Sciences
There are more than 2,000 scientists
and staff
Participated in the battle against sparrows
It can be said that at that time, a number of people emerged across the country.
Various advanced experiences that defy common sense
Many of them come from various universities
and research institutes
The Cultural Revolution, which pushed witch-hunting mentality to its extreme
This is even more related to Chinese higher education institutions
Inextricably linked
The most fervent period in the early stages of the Cultural Revolution
The most radical Red Guard organization
Its core members
These are precisely the students from major universities in Beijing.
and students from key middle schools
1968
Mao Zedong accepted the mangoes presented by the foreign guests.
It was donated to the propaganda team stationed at Tsinghua University.
These mangoes
It immediately became the embodiment of miracles.
Incites fanatical worship
Mangoes are preserved after being treated with preservatives
Even made into a model
Sent to various places for people to admire
Knowledge and academic qualifications
It cannot be naturally considered as a person
Injecting rational antibodies
At least on the surface, in terms of slogans
The Cultural Revolution was undoubtedly the most radical in Chinese history.
The most modern revolution
In theory
Inherited the May Fourth New Culture Movement
Down with the tradition of the Confucian shop
Claiming to be at odds with all old ideas,
Old culture, old customs, old habits
Implement the most thorough break
It holds high the banner of science and materialism.
Claiming to smash the old world
Creating unprecedented new talents
However in practice
This movement, touted as the most revolutionary
But it revived a kind of
It may be older than Confucian culture.
An even older culture of witchcraft
A campaign based on "science" and "democracy"
For the source of enlightenment
Modern Revolution
final
How did it evolve into a nationwide movement?
Exorcism ritual
We often think
Intellectuals are the bastion of reason.
But under a certain psychological structure
intellectuals
On the contrary, because it has stronger
The ability to rationalize
It can turn the most absurd witchcraft into reality.
Packaged as the most rigorous revolutionary theory
Thus getting deeper into trouble
So what's the difference here?
The key here is...
How do we understand
The Origin of "Rationality"
Many people believe
Reason, logic, knowledge, concept
It is a system that can be implemented from top to bottom.
Tools of teaching and indoctrination
That's certainly good.
We need to learn
However, in a fundamental sense
True rational thinking
They cannot be "educated"
Rather, it is a product of an individual's pursuit of freedom and individuality.
It is in a person's self
From the collective representation of chaos
Difficult to separate
And began to try to be proactive
In the process of independently grasping the world
It was only slowly born
This process sounds abstract.
But I will explain later.
All of humanity's most fundamental sciences
and philosophical concepts
Almost all of them are in a personified way
Active experience of ourselves as the subject
The result projected onto the external world
Even if
We are objective
Summary of the law of cause and effect
It also contains
Our Active Experience
for example
If we completely suspend our own experience
The external world we see
It will just be a series of events.
We saw lightning flash.
Then I heard thunder.
Then I saw the big tree fall down.
This is simply the order in which the three things happened.
We cannot observe one
Something called "cause and effect"
We can only see the events.
Appearing one after another
We can never truly understand the external world itself.
It can be seen directly
The former is the reason for the latter.
So what about cause and effect?
Or rather, the concept of cause.
Where did it come from?
It comes precisely from our consciousness.
It stems from our role as the agents of action.
The most primal and core life experience:
I can
Let's imagine...
When a primitive man
The first time I lifted a stone
When cracking open a nut
What he experienced
It's not just about stones falling.
Crack open the nuts
These two events occurred one after the other.
He experienced a complete
Actions guided by his own will
He felt the tension in the muscles of his arm.
I saw the nut crack open.
Between these experiences
There is a direct
Undeniable
His own active connection
It is his ego
Connecting all these events
It is this inherent
Experiences related to "I can cause consequences"
Became
Our understanding of the external world
The first "model"
When we see lightning again
When the big tree fell
We then unconsciously
Experience your own agency
It was projected up
We no longer believe
These are just two events that happened one after the other.
Instead, they believed that the lightning...
Like our arms
What did they "do"?
It "hit" the tree
This caused the tree to fall.
In this instant
The concept of cause and effect
It was born from this anthropomorphic analogy.
us
The experience of treating ourselves as "masters"
It has given the world
The world therefore
Only then did it become explainable.
so
We can see
Reason does not come from nothing.
Even for
In the observation of the most ordinary objective things
It is also always a dynamic entity.
Experiencing the "self" of its own power.
Based on
Without this active subject
As the base color
All we see is the flow of phenomena.
And it will never be able to form a pattern.
and the concept of cause and effect
We can use another example to illustrate this.
Imagine a baby
When he was in a symbiotic relationship with his mother
The world was chaotic to him.
His needs were met magically.
He cried
Food and hugs will come.
He doesn't need to understand the cause and effect behind it.
But when he first produced
I want to rely on my own strength
Climb over there
The thought of getting that toy
An independent self is thus born.
In order to achieve this independent goal
He must begin to use the most basic rationality.
He wants to use his own body
To objectively measure distance
Feel the hardness of the ground
Assess your ability to balance
He will fall
It will fail
But he will learn from real-world feedback.
And correct your behavior
this
"Knowledge, Practice, and Re-knowledge"
process
It is the most original
The operation of rational spirit
It is not taught
Instead, it was driven by an independent will.
Driven
therefore
When we understand
rational spirit
Originating from the subject's initiative
Our concept of Hegel's spirit
This led to a greater understanding.
As he
As stated in "Lectures on the Philosophy of Religion":
"Through intellect"
prose-like knowledge of nature
It was produced relatively late.
Only when the spirit is liberated from nature
Establish yourself independently
Nature resides in the spirit.
Only then can it manifest as something else.
"Something external"
This sentence means that
rational consciousness of nature
and scientific knowledge
It is based on the spirit's transcendence of nature.
To cause nature to lose its spirituality
As a premise
And submerged in nature
Those who fail to transcend nature
Although he is still alive
But his ego
It has not been separated from its surrounding environment.
He cannot distinguish the boundary between himself and the world.
In this chaos,
In a state where the subject and object are not distinguished
Humanity's relationship with the world
There are only two most primitive relationships:
Or fear
Because it is mysterious and powerful
It could devour me at any moment
It's either superstition and worship.
Attempting to use some kind of mysterious intuition
To control it
This is why scientists in the game of Mahjong
Unable to catch sparrows
Viewed as an objective biological object
Instead
Treat it as a
"Pests" with moral attributes
Because deep in their spirit
Nature is not an independent "other".
Rather, it is related to human subjective will.
Interpenetrating byproducts
If I don't play mahjong
So
I am equivalent to
Corrupted by this evil
The rationality and knowledge possessed by the parties involved
This cannot be corrected.
In life
We often see
Many people with outstanding professional skills
Once you leave this major
Entering public life
Or the field of value judgment
Instead, they become as conservative and helpless as babies.
They will accept a certain grand narrative in its entirety.
It will affect powerful groups or authorities.
They have a strong obsession and infatuation.
Because their ego is
Constantly permeated
Moreover, this kind of lack of subjectivity
On the contrary, they are very good at combining rationality and science
Turn into a defense
Weapons that package their fragile core
For example, in statistical thinking
In this video
I've mentioned it before.
A person relying entirely on statistical data
Statistical regularity
Or make decisions based on major trends.
It seems very scientific and rational
In fact, it's similar to primitive people's blind faith in oracles.
They are similar psychologically.
Because of the objectivity presented by statistical data
Often eliminated
The deeper meaning that individuals attribute to it
and emotional resonance
It is pre-defined
An individual is a person without any inclination
and potential
No special characteristics
Ordinary people like a blank slate
Only such people
That's when no internal factors need to be considered.
But in fact
No one is like that.
average or ordinary people
This itself
It is still based on an unverified assumption.
Because there is no independent self as a shield
That cold average
It became something irresistible.
magical commands
It directly penetrated and dominated his will.
So what exactly is this force?
It can suppress a person's agency
Even if a person has read many books
Is the mind still unable to "wean"?
What made him willingly surrender himself?
Submerged in collective chaos
That's all for our next video.
Two key concepts to be explored:
"The Law of Interpenetration" and "Collective Representation"
That's all for today's video.
