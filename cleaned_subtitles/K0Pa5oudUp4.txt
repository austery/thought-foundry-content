I wish the thing we use the ASI for is to like you know cure the diseases and do all the good in the world but it is my prediction that sort of like by the in the endgame what will be at stake will not just be kind of cool products but whether liberal democracy survives like whether the CCP survives like what the world order for the next Century will be and when that is at stake forces will be activated that are sort of Way Beyond what we're talking about now and like you know in in the sort of like crazy race at the end like the sort of national security implications will be the most important you know sort of like you know World War II it's like yeah you know nuclear energy how it stay but in the initial kind of period when you know when this technology was first discovered you had to stabilize the situation you had to get nukes you had to do it right um and then and then the cilon applications had their day I think people talk about AGI and they're always just talking about the private AI labs and I think I just really want to challenge that assumption it just seems pretty likely to me you know as we've talked about for reasons we've talked about that look like the National Security State is going to get involved and um you know I think there's a lot of ways this could look like right is it is it like nationalization is it a public private partnership is it a kind of Defense contract or like relationship is it a sort of government project that soaks up all the people um and so there's respect from there um but I think people are just vastly underrating um the chances of this more or less looking like a government project you know when we have like literal super Intelligence on our cluster right and it's like you know you have a billion like super intelligent scientists they can like hack everything they can like stuck snit the Chinese data centers you know they're starting to build the robo armies you know you like you really think that'll be like a private company and the government would be like oh my God what is going on even backing up like what is it rra why why do we want to win against China we want to win against China because we don't want a top down authoritarian system to win now if the way to beat that is that the most important technology that Humanity will have has to be controlled by a top- down government like what what was the point like why maybe so let's like run our cards with privatization that's the way get to the classic liberal marketas system we want for the Asis all right so lot of talk about here um I think yeah maybe I'll start a bit about like actually looking at what the private world would look like and I think this is part of where the sort of there's no alternative comes from and then let's look like look at like what the government project looks like what checks and balances look like and so on all right private world I first of all okay so right like a lot of people right now talk about open source and I think there's this sort of misconception that like AGI development is going to be like oh it's going to be some like beautiful decentralized thing and you know like you know some giddy community of coders gets to like you know collaborate on that's not how it's going to look like right you know it's you know the hundred billion dollar trillion dollar cluster it's not going to be that many people that have it the algorithms you know it's like right now open source is kind of good because people just use the stuff that was published and so they basically you know the algorithms were published or you know as mol they just kind of like leave deep mind and you know take all the secrets with them and they just kind of replicate it um um but that's not going to continue being the case and so you know the sort of like open source will turn I mean also people say stuff like you know 1026 flops it'll be in my phone you know it's no it won't you know it's like Mo's laws is really slow I mean AI chips are getting better but like you know the hundred billion doll computer will not cost you know like $1,000 you know within your lifetime or whatever aside from so so it's going to be it's going to be like two or three you know big players um on the private world and so look a few things so first of all you know you talk about the sort of like you know enormous power that sort of super intelligence will have and the government will have I think it's pretty plausible that the alternative world is that like one AI company has that power right and speically if we're talking about lead you know it's like what I don't know open AI has a six-month lead and then you know so then you're not talking you're talking about basically you know the most powerful weapon ever and it's you know you're kind of making this like radical bet on like a private Company CEO is the benevolent dictator no no not necessarily like any other thing that's privatized we don't count on them being benevolent we just look to think of for example somebody who manufactures industrial fertilizer right this the person with this Factory if they went back to an ancient civilization they could like blow up Rome they could probably blow up Washington DC and I think people sort of underrate that there are actually a lot of private actors who have the ability to like there's a lot of people who control the water supply or whatever and we can count on cooperation and market-based incentives to basically keep a balance of power I get that things are proceeding really fast but we like we have a lot of historical evidence this is the thing that works best I mean what do we do with nukes right the the way we keep the sort of nukes in check is not like you know a sort of beefed up Second Amendment where like each state has their own like little nuclear Arsenal and like you know Dario and Sam have their own little nuclear Arsenal no no it's like it's it's institutions it's constitutions it's laws it's it's it's courts um and um so so any I don't actually I'm not sure that this you know I'm not sure that the sort of balance of power analogy holds in fact you know sort of the government having the biggest guns is was sort of like an enormous civilizational achievement right like leden in the sort of Holy Roman Empire right you know if somebody from the town over kind of committed a crime on you you know you you didn't kind of start a sort of a you know a big battle between the two towns no you take it to a court of the Holy Roman Empire and they would decide um and it's it's a big achievement now the the thing about you know the industrial fertilizer I think the key difference is kind of speed and offense defense balance issues right so it's like 20th century in you know 10 years in a few years um that is an incredibly scary period and it is incredibly scary you know because it's you know you're going through just this sort of enormous array of destructive technology and the sort of like enormous amount of like you know basically military advance I mean you would have gone from you know kind of like you know you know bayonets and horses to kind of like tank armies and fighter jets in like a couple years and then from you know like you know and then to like you know nukes and you know icbms and Ste you know just like in a matter of years and so it is sort of that speed um that creates I think basically the way I think about is there's going to be this initial just incredibly volatile incredibly dangerous period and somehow we have to make it through that that's going to be incredibly challenging um that's where you need the kind of government project if you can make it through that then you kind of go to like you know now we can now you know the situation has been stabilized you know we don't face this imminent national security threat you know it's like yes there were kind of wmds that came along the way but either we've managed to kind of like have a sort of stable offense defense balance right like I think bioweapons initially are a huge issue right like an attacker can just create like a thousand different synthetic you know viruses and spread them and it's like going to be really hard for you to kind of like make a defense against each but maybe at some point you figure out the kind of like you know Universal defense against every possible virus and then you're in a stable situation again on the offens defense or you do the thing you know you do with planes where it's there's like you know there's certain capabilities that the private sector isn't allowed to have and you've like figured out what's going on restrict those and then you can kind of like let let you know you let the sort of Civilian civilian uses so I'm skeptical of this because there and then sorry I I mean the other important thing is so I talked about the sort of you know maybe it's like it's it's a you know it's you know it's one company with all this power and I think it is like I think it is unprecedented because it's like the industrial fertilizer Guy cannot overthrow the US government I think it's quite plausible that like the AI company with super intelligence can overthrow the there be multiple AI companies right and I buy that one of them could be AE so it's not obvious that it'll be multiple I think it's again if there's like a six-month lead maybe maybe there's two or three but if there's two or three then what you have is just like a crazy race between these two or three companies you know it's like you know whatever Demis and Sam they're just like I don't want to let the other one win and um and they're both developing their nuclear arsenals and the it's just like also like come on the government is not going to let these people you know are they going to let like you know is Dario going to be order the one developing the kind of like you know you know super hacking stucked and like deploying against the Chinese data center the other issue though is it won't just if it's two or three it won't just be two or three it'll be two or three and it'll be China and Russia and North Korea because the private in the private lab World there is no way they'll have security that is good enough okay I agree that like I'm worried if samario have a one-year lead on ASI in that in that world then I'm like concerned about this being privatized but in that exact same world I'm very concerned about Donald Trump having the capability and potentially if we're living in a world where the take office lower than you anticipate in that world I'm like very much I want the private companies so like in no part of this Matrix is it obviously true that the government project is better than the private project let's talk about the government project a little bit and checks and balances in some sense I think my argument is a sort of biran argument which is like American checks and balances have held for you know over 200 years and through crazy technological revolutions you know the US military could kill like every civilian in the United States going to make that argument the private public uh balance of power has held for hundreds of years and then but yeah why has it held because the government has the biggest guns and as never before has a single CEO or a random nonprofit board had the ability to launch nukes the United States national security state is going to be intimately involved with this and this will you know the labs whether you know and I think again the government a lot of what I think is the government project looks like it is basically a joint venture between like you know the cloud providers between some of the labs and the government and so I think there is no world in which the government isn't intimately involved in this like crazy period the very least basically you know like the intelligence agencies need to be running security for these Labs so they're already kind of like they're controlling everything they're controlling access to everything um then they're going to be like probably again if we're in this like really volatile International situation like a lot of the initial applications it'll it'll suck it's not what I want to use ASI for we'll be like trying to somehow stabilize this crazy situation um somehow we need to prevent like proliferation of like some crazy new wmds and like the undermining of mutually assur destruction uh to kind of like you know North Korea and Russia and China um and so I think you know I basically think your world you know I think there's much more Spectrum than you're acknowledging here and I think basically the world in which it's private Labs is like extremely heavy government involvement and really what we're debating is like you know what form of government project but it is going to look much more like you know the National Security State than anything it does look like like a startup as it is right now look I think something like that makes sense I would be if it's like the Manhattan Project then I'm very worried where it's like this is part of the US military um where if it's more like listen you got to talk to before you like the TR L like locky Martin skor's part of the US military it's like they call the shots yeah I I don't think that's great I think that's I think that's bad I think it would be bad if that happened with ASI what is the alternative okay so it's it's closer to my end of the spectrum where yeah you do have to talk to Jan before you can launch the next training cluster but there's many companies who are still going for it and the government will be intimately involved in the security but the AI is still broadly deployed and Alignment works in the sense that you can make sure that it's not the system level prompt is like you can't help people make bioweapons or something I mean I expect the a to be broadly deployed I mean first of all if it's a government project I mean look I think first of all like I think the meadows of the world you know open sourcing their eyes you know that are two years behind or whatever yeah super valuable role they're going to like you know and and so there's going to be some question of like either the offense defense balance is fine and so like even if they open source two-y old AIS it's fine or it's like there's some restrictions on the most extreme dual use capabilities like you know you don't let private companies sell kind of crazy weapons um and that's great and that will help with the diffusion I mean I think the sort of alignment angle during the intelligence explosion it's going to you know it's not a process of like years of bureaucracy and then you can kind of write some standards I think it looks much more like basically a war and like you have a fog of War it's like look it's like is it safe to do the next o you know and it's like ah you know like you know we're like three ooms into the intelligence explosion we don't really understand what's going on anymore um you know the um um you know like a bunch of our like generalization scaling curves are like kind of looking not great you know some of our like automated AI researchers that are doing alignment are saying it's fine but we don't quite Trust them in this test you know that like the eyes started doing naughty things and ah but then we like hammered it out and then it was fine and and like ah should we should we go ahead should we take you know another six months also by the way you know like China just stole the weights or we you know they're about to like deploy the RoR Army like what do we do I think it's this I think it is this crazy situation um and um you know basically you you relying much more on kind of like a sane chain of command than you are on sort of some like you know deliberative regulatory scheme I wish you had were able to do the liberative regulatory scheme and this is the thing about the private companies too I don't think you know they all claim they're going to do safety but I think it's really rough when you're in the commercial race and there're startups you know and startups startups are startups you know I think they're not fit to handle wmds
