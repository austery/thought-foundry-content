[MUSIC PLAYING]
ADI IGNATIUS: All
right, so, Steven,
thank you for being
with us today.
STEVEN PINKER:
Thanks for having me.
ADI IGNATIUS: Great.
So your book is about common
knowledge, what it is,
and how we use it, and in
ways that we're aware of,
and in ways that
we aren't aware of.
So for the audience,
what are you
getting at with common
knowledge and why should we
care about that?
STEVEN PINKER: I'm using the
term in a specialized sense, not
to refer to conventional
wisdom or something that
is widely known,
but to something
that is known to be known.
That is, I know
something, you know it,
you know that I know it.
I know that you know it.
You know that I know
that you know it,
and so on, ad infinitum.
So that's common knowledge
in the technical sense.
It's important, because it's
necessary for coordination
for two or more people
to be on the same page
to make choices that
might be arbitrary,
but it works for everyone
as long as everyone
makes the same choice.
Do you stay home on
Saturday or Sunday?
Do you drive on the right
or drive on the left?
Now, for common
knowledge to work,
you don't literally
have to think,
I know that she
knows that I know
that she knows because your head
starts to spin after one or two
levels.
And we have a sense
of common knowledge
when something is conspicuous,
or self-evident, or public,
or out there.
If I see it while I
see you seeing it,
then I kind of
know that you know
that I know that you know it.
ADI IGNATIUS: So this is
the Emperor has no clothes.
STEVEN PINKER: Well,
I begin the book
with the story of the
Emperor's New Clothes,
because there's a
sense in which it's
a story about common knowledge.
Because when the little boy
said the emperor was naked,
he wasn't telling
anyone anything
they didn't already know.
But he changed the
state of their knowledge
nonetheless, because
by blurting out
what everyone could see within
earshot of everyone else,
at that moment, everyone
knew that everyone else knew
that everyone else knew
that the emperor was naked.
And another point in
the book is that just
like driving on the
right or driving
on the left is a solution
to a coordination problem,
or staying home Saturday,
or staying home Sunday,
or respecting paper
currency, I suggest
that our informal social
relationships, are we friends?
Do I defer to you?
Are we transactional partners?
Are we lovers?
All of those are matters of
common knowledge as well.
They're coordination games.
And we solidify them by
generating some public signal
that we both see that
inaugurates the relationship.
But there can be forms of common
belief, common misconception,
common pretense, where you do
have assumptions about what
other people are thinking, and
vice versa, that in some cases,
may not actually be reality.
So in the case of
a common pretense,
where we refer to
that by saying we're
ignoring the
elephant in the room,
the metaphor is that
an elephant in the room
is something you can't
ignore, but we're
pretending to ignore it.
There is a phenomenon called
pluralistic ignorance,
or a spiral of silence.
In economics, it's sometimes
called the Abilene paradox,
where no one actually
believes something,
but everyone thinks that
everyone else believes it,
but no one actually does.
ADI IGNATIUS: Is there
an easy example of that?
STEVEN PINKER: Sure,
it was originally
studied in fraternity, where
all the frat guys said privately
that it's really stupid to drink
until you puke and pass out.
But they said, what
can I do about it?
All the other guys
think it's cool.
And it turns out, none of
them thought it was cool,
but everyone thought
that everyone else
thought it was cool.
I think there have been
many phenomena like that.
It turns out that in Saudi
Arabia, most of the men
think that women should have
the right to work and drive,
but they couldn't
allow their wives
to do it because they
mistakenly thought
that all the other men thought
that it was impermissible.
ADI IGNATIUS: So I want to lead
this conversation sort of mainly
into economic, financial
sort of market areas,
because we are the HBR IdeaCast.
But your book is--
I'd say it's challenging
in some ways.
There are a lot
of brain teasers.
There are a lot of prisoner's
dilemmas, things like that.
But it's also fun.
I mean, there are a lot of
popular references, jokes,
cartoons, and then examples,
really interesting kind
of game playing examples.
So one of the things you talk
about is the Keynesian beauty
contest, which, and if I get
it wrong, you'll correct me,
but where a judge is rated--
a judge doesn't simply
select the contestant
that he or she thinks
is most attractive,
but rather is
rewarded on selecting,
based on what he
thinks-- he or she thinks
the other judges will select.
STEVEN PINKER: Who are
engaged in the same puzzle.
They're guessing what
everyone else will
judge to be the
prettiest face, which
is different from the old Miss
Rheingold competition, where
people voted on
the prettiest face.
In the beauty contest that
Keynes hinted might have been
in the newspapers in his
day, this would be London
in the '20s, no one can actually
verify whether there really was
such a contest, but it
was a great example.
Because for Keynes,
where he said
everyone is trying to outguess
other people outguessing still
other people, he said that's the
way speculative investing works.
They buy the
security because they
think they can sell it at a
higher price to other people
who think it's underpriced, who
in turn, will want to sell it
to still other people.
And so speculative
bubbles, crypto perhaps
being one of the
most recent examples,
are cases where people think
that other people will,
in the future, will
want to buy in,
sometimes called the greater
fool theory of investing,
that you invest
because you think
other people will invest
because they think that still
other people will invest.
The thing is, of course, bubbles
can pop when the market starts
to run out of the greater fools
who think that it will continue
to appreciate forever.
But this can all
get started when
there is some public
signal, like in the case
of the Emperor's New Clothes,
the boy blurting it out,
or a public ceremony
or a public signal.
Or if there is just a
rumor or some reason
to think that other
people are getting in,
that can cause other
people to get in.
So a couple of recent
examples are meme stocks,
where an influencer
might talk up a stock,
even if the fundamentals
are terrible, crummy.
But the fact that other people
know that he's talking it up
and they know that still other
people are talking it up,
means that it really
can appreciate, at least
for a while.
Or in two Super Bowls
ago, there were a number
of high concept ads for
crypto exchanges, which
mentioned nothing about
the advantages of crypto.
ADI IGNATIUS: These are
the Larry David ads.
STEVEN PINKER: The Larry
David, the Matt Damon.
Where the point of the ads were
everyone's getting into crypto,
don't be left out.
And in fact, the punchline
to the Larry David comic ad
was don't be like Larry.
Don't be left out.
ADI IGNATIUS: So this
sounds like a tool
that people who
understand the psychology
could and probably do
benefit from, right?
STEVEN PINKER: Yes.
And getting back to marketing,
I talk about an analysis
by a political scientist
like Michael Chwe, who's,
in some ways, my
predecessor in writing
a book about common
knowledge, where
he analyzed the most famous and
most expensive ad in history.
This was the 1984 ad directed
by Ridley Scott of Blade
Runner and Alien fame, ran
exactly once during the 1984
Super Bowl.
And it was to introduce
the Apple Macintosh.
So it was a revolutionary
new product.
Those of us who remember the
first personal computers,
remember, it had a little screen
with 24 lines of 80 characters.
And you had to type in
alphanumeric commands
like del fubar dot--
fu dot bar.
ADI IGNATIUS: We've
come a long way.
STEVEN PINKER: They were clumsy.
So Apple is coming out with
this insanely great new product
with windows, and menus,
and icons, and a mouse.
But they realized that
no one would buy it
if they thought they were
the only one buying it
because the price wouldn't
come down because of demand.
There wouldn't be a
community of users,
and experts, and markets for
peripherals and consumables.
So how do you break the knot--
cut the knot, I
mean, and get people
to buy something
that they'll only
buy if enough other
people are buying it.
And the answer is the Super
Bowl is an annual rite
in American culture.
You know that a lot of
people are watching it.
And you know that a lot of
people know that a lot of people
are watching it.
It is a common
knowledge generator.
And to break the logjam,
Apple paid for this ad.
It said nothing about
the Apple computer.
For those of you
who have seen it,
it played off the fact that
it was January 1984, the date
of George Orwell's novel.
And so it showed a
grim corporate meeting
where gray drones trudge
into a cavernous hall
and listen to drivel from
a voice on the screen,
intercut with scenes of a lithe
young woman in a bright red gym
shorts and a singlet
carrying a mallet.
And she bursts into
the corporate meeting,
hammer throws the mallet
into the screen, which
explodes in a
fireball, revealing
the crawl that
says on January 25,
Apple introduced the Macintosh.
And you'll see why 1984
won't be like 1984.
Now, the point of the ad was
not to advertise the product.
It didn't say anything
about the product,
but to advertise the
potential buyership.
It generated common knowledge.
I'm seeing the ad.
I know lots of other
companies are seeing the ad.
And what Chwe showed,
I mean, it's a story.
How did he prove it?
Well, he looked--
because I mean,
that's just a sample of one.
So he looked at
other products that
only work if enough
other people adopt it,
products that depend
on network effects.
But monster.com was one of
the first jobseeking ads.
Now, why would anyone look
for a job on monster.com
unless they thought that lots
of employers were posting there?
Why would employers
post there unless they
thought a lot of job seekers
were looking for jobs there?
Monster.com was introduced
at the Super Bowl.
So there are
companies that depend
on network effects that have
to generate common knowledge.
Everyone has to that
everyone knows about them.
Another example is the
Discover credit card,
which was great credit card,
rebates, and high limits.
But didn't matter if you
were the only one who
had a Discover card, because
no merchant would accept it.
And no merchant would
accept it unless they
thought enough people
were going to carry it.
Introduced in the Super Bowl.
And Chwe argued that there
was another category.
Aside from products that
inherently depend on networks,
there are prestige goods
that depend on other people
that you respect also
consuming that product.
Products that are
consumed in public
and where the brand
image is important
also tend to advertise
in the Super Bowl.
And crucially, what Chwe
showed was not so much
that advertisers were
willing to pay per eyeball,
but they would be willing to
pay a premium for venues that
were common knowledge
generators, where
it was known that a lot of
people were to watch them.
They were willing to pay
more per eyeball for products
that were consumed
in public or that
depended on network effects.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah,
so the phenomenon--
maybe the flip side
of this phenomenon
is the toilet paper
shortage during COVID,
which was not this, not network
effects, but an assumption
that I know what you know
that I know that you--
STEVEN PINKER: Well,
yes, Justin Wolfers
speculated that the great
COVID toilet paper shortage was
like a bank run where
people withdraw their money,
not necessarily because
they think that there's
anything wrong with
the bank, but they
have heard that other
people think there might
be something wrong, unsound.
And they may just have heard
that other people think
there might be something
that's unsound.
So you get this
reverberant doubt.
And no one wants to be the last
customer withdrawing at a point
where the bank no longer
can cover its deposits.
So people rush to the bank
to withdraw their savings,
which actually causes the
bank to fail, which otherwise,
it wouldn't.
Likewise, Wolfers suggested
that there actually
wasn't a toilet paper shortage.
It's true that people
were staying home,
so they were using
six packs of Charmin
instead of the big jumbo
rolls in their workplace.
But Kimberly-Clark quickly
stepped up production
to meet the demand.
But somehow, people just
know that in an emergency,
people hoard toilet
paper, which can
cause the very shortage
that leads people
to hoard toilet paper.
And so they did
hoard toilet paper.
A lot of retailers
then posted signs,
max three rolls per customer.
ADI IGNATIUS: That will
Reinforce it, yeah.
STEVEN PINKER: And that
ended the shortage,
not so much because people
didn't strip the shelves,
because they couldn't.
But they were reassured
that since no one else could
buy more than three rolls, there
was no reason for them to panic.
And again, getting back
to common knowledge,
how did this originate?
At least according
to one history,
it all started with another
common knowledge generator,
The Tonight Show.
Which back in the
three network era,
Johnny Carson was the
King of Late Night.
He had not only a huge audience,
but people knew that people were
watching Johnny Carson, which is
why catchphrases from the show
like, "here's Johnny,"
everyone recognized it.
So one night, I
think it was 1973,
he said, there have been all
kinds of shortages lately.
And this was an era
where there were
lines to get gasoline because
of the Arab oil embargo.
And there was a meat shortage
and a coffee shortage.
And he said, have
you heard the latest?
I read it in the papers.
There's a shortage
of toilet paper.
Now, it turned out
it wasn't true.
At the time, there was no
shortage of toilet paper.
But then that created a
shortage of toilet paper
when everyone ran out to buy it.
And since then, at least
according to the story,
it's hard to prove, it's just
become conventional wisdom
that toilet paper becomes
scarce in an emergency.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah,
that is fascinating.
So all of this must be
very valuable for people
who are in negotiation.
Because negotiation is always,
what is it that we both know?
And what is it that only I know?
And I mean, that's how you win.
STEVEN PINKER: Yeah.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, talk about
to what extent I know you know.
I mean that's the
fundamental of--
and the people negotiate
better probably understand
this concept.
STEVEN PINKER:
Yeah, so negotiation
is one of a number of kinds of
games in the game theory sense,
meaning the my best option
depends on what you do
and vice versa.
And in any time in which there
can be multiple equilibria,
cases where everyone is better
off if they both do something,
but it isn't preordained
what they'll do.
So the negotiation
is what's sometimes
called a battle of the
sexes is the technical term.
Has nothing actually
to do with the sexes,
but it refers to a
hypothetical couple, where they
like to spend time together.
He would prefer that they
go to the hockey game.
She would prefer
to go to the opera.
They'd rather go to either
than not do something together.
So the question is,
which one do they go to?
Both of them are equilibria.
The case of negotiation, let's
say a car salesman and a buyer,
there's a range of prices
in which the salesman makes
a profit and the customer
pays what they're
willing to pay to get the car.
But within that
range, the highest
the customer is willing to
pay, the lowest the seller
is willing to sell for,
how do they decide?
Obviously, the seller wants
it as high as possible.
The buyer wants it
as low as possible.
If either of them walks
away from the deal,
then they're both worse off.
So how do they decide?
So there are many
predicaments in life
like this where there are
many ways of doing something,
but both parties are better
off if they can figure out
some way to do it.
In the case of a negotiation,
it's interesting.
This is something pointed
out many years ago
by the political scientist
Thomas Schelling,
who won a Nobel Prize
for this and other work.
That often, a buyer
and seller will--
in order to find
somewhere, anywhere
to land on that the other
guy will agree with,
they'll pick something like
a splitting the difference
or a round number.
He notes that the salesman who
announced that his rock bottom
price for the car is $30,007.26
is pretty much pleading to be
relieved of $7.26.
It's like, oh, come on.
So the why a round number?
I mean, what's so special
about a round number?
What's special is
other people can
think it's special or can expect
each other to recognize it
as special.
And so these points,
focal points,
sometimes called Schelling
points, points that pop out
in the minds of both
parties, and that's
all they need to
come to an agreement,
are often where
negotiations end up.
ADI IGNATIUS: So when you
talk about common knowledge,
particularly some of
the early references,
it seems a different era
than where we are now.
I mean, and maybe
this was never true,
but people my age will
look back and say,
well, we used to agree on facts.
We probably didn't all
together, but we kind of did.
As you say, there were
only three networks.
There wasn't this
sort of ubiquity
of opinion and everything.
Now, we're really
in an era where
there are competing
truths, and I would assume
competing common knowledges.
Obviously, there are various
common knowledge between people
and in relationships,
but at a larger level,
I guess, my question
is, is that eroding
the kind of common
knowledge that
enables social interaction,
et cetera, et cetera.
Is that a concern for you?
STEVEN PINKER:
There is that fear.
Although, as you say,
and I often point out,
the best explanation for the
good old days is a bad memory.
And there was a lot of
polarization in the '60s, too.
It had riots, and terrorist
bombings, and assassinations,
and so on.
And duly not
romanticizing the past,
there does seem
to be an increase
in negative polarization.
That is not just
the people disagree,
but each thinks that
the other is evil.
And it's plausible that
one of the contributors
was the fragmentation
of the media markets.
So that instead of
everyone watching
Walter Cronkite or Huntley and
Brinkley, first with cable news,
with Fox News,
whose business model
was to cultivate a highly
partisan audience that
wants to hear a certain
kind of spin on everything.
And with social media,
where the networks
of posting, and reposting,
and tweeting, and retweeting,
and linking, and
relinking has been
shown to take place
within two or more
closed networks with not
much interaction between.
There could be separate pools
of common belief within each
of these communities,
something that's
easier to happen when there
isn't one public signal, a Super
Bowl, or Johnny Carson,
or Walter Cronkite
that everyone knows that
everyone knows is aware of.
ADI IGNATIUS: OK, so this
concept of common knowledge
existing in different
ways in different forms
of relationships,
so within a company,
if an executive,
if a leader wants
to create a sort
of common knowledge
that he or she imagines would
be beneficial for the culture
of the company, is
there a playbook almost
for how to create a kind of
positive common knowledge
within this environment?
STEVEN PINKER: Well, in
general, common knowledge
is generated by something
that is conspicuous, public.
So face-to-face meetings can
generate common knowledge
in a way that say,
remote meetings don't.
That is when you're in a
room, you see everyone else.
They see you.
You know that they're
seeing each other
and seeing the
speaker or the leader.
So I think there is still--
that's one of the reasons that--
as with the Super Bowl,
which is a broadcast version,
but there is an important
role for publicly
conspicuous notices.
Sometimes pronouncements, going
back to the economy as a whole,
the reason that
statements from the Fed
are scrutinized and pored
over like rabbis parsing
the Talmud or--
is that anything that the
chairman of the Fed says
can create its own reality
when people, knowing
that other people have
heard it, will act on it
out of anticipation of
what other people will do,
which can then feed
on itself and create
a bubble, a recession.
So I quote Alan Greenspan,
who at one point
said, "since I've
become chair of the Fed,
I've learned to mumble
with great incoherence.
If I seem clear to you, you must
have misunderstood what I said."
Because a signal that,
say, a recession is ahead
will create that recession
because companies
won't hire out of
fear that they'll
have to lay off employees.
Consumers won't buy
out of fear that they
might lose their
jobs, each of which
then creates the
reality of the other.
And so the chairman of the Fed
has to be very, very careful
as to what she or he says.
ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, what's
interesting in all of this,
and you talk about
politics in some ways,
you talk about
authoritarian politics.
And I lived in China.
And I lived in Russia.
And you did have the
phenomenon that you described,
which is that everybody knows
that the regime is rotten,
but nobody says it because
you can't be certain
if you take to the
streets, there's
going to be anybody
else with you,
even though everybody
sort of knows.
And then you understand
why authoritarianism,
why you have to
control everything.
Because the moment you
loosen up anything,
it allows for this
possibility of communication
and understanding.
And it's like that moment when
Ceausescu fell in Romania.
And he controlled everything.
And suddenly, there were a few
people shouting in the back
as he's giving a speech.
And some stuff's happening,
he realizes it's over.
Because it's either complete
control or no control.
STEVEN PINKER: In particular,
so the control has to be--
no dictator can control every
last member of the population.
There just isn't
enough firepower,
there aren't enough informants.
And as I quote the character
of Gandhi in the movie by that
name, who at one point, tells
a British colonial officer,
"in the end, you will leave
because 100,000 Englishmen
simply cannot control 350
million Indians if the Indians
refuse to cooperate."
He could have said,
refuse to coordinate
or are unable to coordinate.
So people can overpower
a regime if they all
stand up at the same time,
if they all storm the palace,
if they all stop work.
But how can they do it
if each one is afraid
that he'll be the only one?
And if he stands up, he can
be picked off or bundled off
to prison.
If everyone protests
at the same time,
then they can-- there's
the safety in numbers.
But there's safety
in coordination.
So there has to be a way of
generating the common knowledge,
now's the time that we
all stand up together.
So a protest in a
public square, where
everyone sees everyone
else seeing everyone else
can often do it.
Which is why dictators are often
terrified of public protests.
Or if there is a widely
circulated magazine,
TV show, radio
show, which is why
they clamp down on the media.
ADI IGNATIUS: Talk
about the blank paper.
STEVEN PINKER: Oh, yes.
So there's a joke from the
Soviet Union about a man handing
out leaflets in Red Square.
Of course, the KGB arrest him.
They bundle them off
to police headquarters,
only to discover
that the leaflets are
blank sheets of paper.
And they confronted him.
They demand, what is
the meaning of this?
And he says, what's
there to say?
It's so obvious.
So the point of the joke was he
was generating common knowledge.
He didn't need to say anything
because people already knew it,
but they didn't know that
everyone else knew it.
And all the people
accepting the leaflets
were then generating
the common knowledge
that everyone knew that
everyone knew it, which
is why it was so subversive.
And in a case of life
imitating a joke,
Putin's police force has
arrested a number of people
for carrying blank signs.
ADI IGNATIUS: Well, I
wonder if it was before--
so in China, where it's
very dangerous to protest
and very dangerous
to dissent publicly,
after the mishandling
of COVID, there
were famously blank
paper protests.
STEVEN PINKER: Oh, interesting.
ADI IGNATIUS: Possibly
inspired by the original--
STEVEN PINKER: Joke.
ADI IGNATIUS: Soviet joke, yeah.
So the book is fascinating.
And you put your finger
on common knowledge,
and how we know what
we know, and how
we think about certain
things and how we operate.
What are we supposed
to do with all that?
STEVEN PINKER: Well, it's
hard to answer that question
because I didn't
write it kind of as a
how to book, or as a
manual, or self-help.
It's kind of a work
in fundamental science
and logic and philosophy with
lots and lots of applications.
How you work it out
in a particular case
often depends on the
particular payoffs.
What would happen if
you fail to coordinate?
What do you gain if
you do coordinate?
If there are multiple ways
of coordinating, who gains,
who loses?
So there's no kind
of single formula.
But it is a lens with
which to view the world,
simply because coordination is
so ubiquitous in human affairs.
Any corporation, any
institution, any school,
any relationship, any couple,
any friendship, any family,
these are all people
trying to coordinate.
And they always have to
coordinate with some signal
of common knowledge.
They often, in order to
preserve the relationship,
have to keep things out
of common knowledge.
And so all the phenomena of
politeness, euphemism, innuendo,
tact, pretending not to see
the elephant in the room,
beating around the bush,
hypocrisy, genteel hypocrisy,
all of those I consider to be
cases where people privately
know something, but there's
some reason to keep it out
of common knowledge.
The reason being, something
in common knowledge
changes the relationship.
Sometimes, you don't want
to change the relationship.
Or you don't want to signal
the wrong relationship.
So just to give a couple
of examples, I mean,
the most common case
of systematic hypocrisy
is politeness.
"If you could pass the salt,
that would be awesome."
What?
If you think about it
literally, it really
doesn't make a
whole lot of sense.
But could you pass the salt?
Do you think you
might pass the salt?
Why do we go through
those rituals?
It's because we don't want
to boss each other around.
I don't want to
give you a command
as if you're the butler
assuming that we're friends,
or for that matter, strangers.
ADI IGNATIUS: That's
really interesting.
So benign hypocrisy or
some of these protocols,
they may not be direct,
they may not be honest,
but they're what we
need to function.
STEVEN PINKER:
They're what we need
to preserve our relationships
because our relationships are
coordination games which
depend on common knowledge.
