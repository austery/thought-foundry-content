Before, we introduced a storytelling film about algorithms and surveillance capitalism
Many viewers responded after the video was released
We’ve known these things for a long time, but you can’t do anything
Do you want to stop using YouTube Google Facebook?
The book "Human Rights in the Digital Age" is the book I will face today
I'm going to tell you what should we do if we cannot do without digital technology
The author of this book is Australian lawyer Lizzei O'shea
In this book, he analyzes the ten key controversies in the Internet age
I chose five that are more relevant to everyone’s lives
Let’s see how we should think about the contemporary society ruled by digital technology
We talked about surveillance capitalism before
It’s a digital record of how technology companies use computers, mobile phones, and home appliances.
To produce your personalized data and then sell it to advertisers to make money
A 2012 study pointed out
The U.S. "data mining industry" has a market value of up to 156 billion
670,000 practitioners
Surveillance capitalism has become a huge business opportunity
But at the same time, these technology companies often promise that users can maintain privacy
For example, the mobile phone can be set to "turn off location" and "incognito mode"
Or use "Anonymous Browser"
But information scientist Latanya Sweeney found that
87% of Americans can be identified only by postal code, gender and birthday
Even if you hide all this information
Data companies can still use a technique called "biometric profile"
Because everyone presses the keyboard differently
So as long as you analyze the mode of pressing the keyboard, you can create your personal profile
In other words, there is no way to escape surveillance capitalism
At this time, there are voices of various factions in the society
Someone said: I haven’t done anything illegal, why should I be afraid of being monitored?
Another group of people will say: they give you free software
Of course you have to pay for it
Another group of people will say: Recommend ads to you based on your preferences
Isn't this very convenient?
So at this time the question becomes:
When the social network becomes a market for selling goods
Keep showing your favorite ad posts and videos
Is this kind of online life really a good life?
For example, dating software Tinder and OkCupid
Their parent company, Match Group, is a data provider
On the surface, use your data to help you find suitable objects
Privately sell your personal assets to a third party to make money
So you may only meet people who the system thinks are suitable for you on the dating software
It also precludes the possibility of getting to know other people
So is this really a good internet experience?
Or just let users live in the stratosphere for warmth?
The other bigger problem is
When the online platform is completely monopolized by a few capital companies
They also monopolize the world that the public can see
Companies that pay for advertising can make their website appear on the first page of search results
So what you found is not a neutral result
These surveillance companies are sometimes for the market
Even make a political censorship mechanism
Like 2014 is the 25th anniversary of Tiananmen Square
LinkedIn censored content related to Tiananmen Square
If your resume mentions studying the Tiananmen incident in Chinese history
Your page will be banned directly
A LinkedIn spokesperson came out and said:
"In order to create value for members in China and around the world, we must implement content control."
Or in 2017
The U.S. government and the Israeli government join forces
Orders Facebook to delete accounts of Palestinian leaders' political parties tracked by millions
So that they can't call on the crowd to organize action
After the Palestinian sources were "disappeared"
The “mainstream media” on Facebook began to promote news of Palestinians firing on Israel
So that users all over the world can only see unilateral messages
So in the past few years, many Facebook opinion leaders have been saying that they will step out of the “Facebook Stratosphere”
But in fact, the essence of Facebook is to create a stratosphere
Because Facebook’s revenue comes from ad viewing
Only let users soak in the stratosphere and spend more time on it
Social media can earn more advertising profits
So not so much that Google Facebook is a social media platform
It's better to say that they are essentially advertising companies
84% of Google's revenue in 2018 came from advertising
98% of Facebook's 2019 revenue comes from advertising
These social media have actually contributed to the simplification of sources of political radicalization
So the researchers think
In fact, the digital network has not improved in the past five years, but has gotten worse
Because information becomes less circulated and more closed
On the contrary, when the Internet first appeared and was not invaded by surveillance capitalism
Information is more circulated
For example, American law professor Wu Xiuming put forward the concept of "net neutrality"
The online platform is not a space where everyone can spend money to buy a page
It should be neutral
Only in order to guarantee the free flow of information can there be fair competition.
Just like in democratic politics we will insist that one person, one vote is equal
Won't make the rich people's votes more valuable
same
We should create "digital citizenship" in cyberspace
Let every citizen have an equal right to participate
Instead of giving companies that have the money to advertise to have a greater say
The author thinks that we can further ask:
What is our imagination of cyberspace?
If cyberspace is like a city
And a city is occupied by capital enterprises without neutral public space
People in that city are totally ruled by some power
In the 1960s, New York City had to do urban renewal
Want to demolish Washington Square Park and rebuild a highway
Those who supported Dugeng at the time said the same as those who supported surveillance capitalism today.
Saying that there are highways can make car driving more convenient!
But in fact this will only make it more convenient for people who have money to buy a car
So at the time, American social activist Jane Jacobs came out to write a letter
Letter to the Mayor of New York against demolition of the park
Jane Jacob thinks
A city must be successful and prosperous
It is necessary to create a public space to accommodate people of different social backgrounds
Parks can allow different people to interact
Inject diversity and surprise into the city
Jane Jacob fought for ten years and finally kept Washington Square Park in New York
Let the new generation of New Yorkers have a public space for open communication
The same principle applies to today’s digital networks
Our generation’s imagination of cyberspace
It is the monitoring that allows capital companies to do whatever they want
Still insist that cyberspace should be neutral and free to communicate
Will determine what kind of cyberspace the next generation of people will live in
In addition to corporate monitoring
State surveillance has been much discussed in recent years
The Chinese government has developed a public security big data system "Policing Cloud" in the past few years.
Can be used to monitor "dissidents" and "government tracers"
There is also a social credit scoring system to help people calculate scores in an attempt to create a "harmonious society"
At the same time, the U.S. government is actually doing the same thing
The government cooperates with data providers to develop "predictive police technology" to identify criminal suspects
Like Palantir Technologies, the most profitable data company in Silicon Valley
Is called "the sweet darling of American law enforcement agencies"
So the U.S. and China seem to have different political systems on the surface
But it’s very similar in monitoring the people
Some people will say: Government surveillance can maintain social order and national security.
But we can further ask: Does national surveillance really make life safer?
For example, in the incident that occurred in 2017, the "want to cry worm attack" in which Windows users worldwide were victimized
It’s the hackers exploiting the NSA’s vulnerabilities.
Blocking Microsoft users’ computers to threaten ransom
In fact, the U.S. National Security Agency discovered this bug five years ago.
But it did not notify Microsoft of the amendment
This is why Edward Snowden, who escaped the United States, would say
The exchange of "privacy" for "security" is actually a false opposition
Because the premise of information security is that the information must have sufficient privacy
Like in reality
We will ask the police to have a search ticket from the court
Before we can come into our house and search
But in the digital space
We allow the country to use our data at will
Isn’t it weird that you don’t need to have a search ticket?
So we must reflect on:
Why in the real world we pay attention to the right of privacy not to be infringed by the state
But in the online world, we allow countries to violate the right to privacy?
After talking about digital monitoring
The author further pointed out
The concept of privacy is actually not enough to understand our current digital life
Because we are not just being monitored and watched
But to be secretly controlled our behavior on the Internet
We are forced to watch the ads that companies want us to see
It is also said that this is the most suitable product for us using data analysis
It’s like when Algeria was a French colony in the 20th century
Negro in Algeria
You can only know yourself through black advertisements created by white oppressors
But know yourself through the people who oppress you
Itself is a very alien experience
The black people at the time were portrayed as the laughing stock of entertainment by the white people in the advertisements.
The same as our current digital life
I can only know myself through the advertisements produced by the company
The diversity of human life is reduced to one type:
Is the consumer who buys the goods
But this does not mean that we have to deny digital technology
Because the ruled can also use the tools created by the ruler in turn
For example, when France colonized Algeria
White colonists introduced broadcasting technology to manage local blacks
But after the anti-colonial war of independence broke out
The philosopher Fanon at the time discovered
When the blacks occupied the radio station
Radio has become a better communication channel than newspapers
Can send messages to illiterate people
So the author believes that a major challenge in the 21st century
Is to transform the cyberspace of digital surveillance into a decentralized free space
Because the Internet was originally decentralized when it first appeared
It was not invaded by surveillance companies until the emergence of the data mining industry at the end of the 20th century
So only privacy is not enough
We must also obtain "digital autonomy"
In other words, the digital space can get rid of the secret manipulation of advertising data providers
Getting rid of surveillance capitalism sounds very far away
But in fact, there are more and more decentralized platforms
Like the social media platform Diaspora
Network platform Solid
Server system Freedom Box
Or open street map OpenStreetMap
Open Street Map allows users to work together to edit the map
Unlike the private company Google Map, which can decide what to display on the map
So it’s actually more helpful to those organizations that want to go to the disaster area for relief
on the other hand
Jack Balkin, a jurist at Yale University in the United States, also pointed out
We should put the technology companies that control our assets
When it’s like a lawyer and physician who masters our personal resources
The lawyer owns the client's confidential information
The doctor owns the patient’s medical records
The law will not allow lawyers or physicians to use this information to make money
Even if the patient agrees to the doctor to sell medical information, it is still illegal
These regulations should also apply to technology companies
Otherwise we can't explain
Why do we not accept lawyers and physicians to use our information to make money
But can we accept that technology companies use our data to make money?
In 2015, Google's photo app was released
Automatically recognize the face of a black man as a chimpanzee
Let Google take the initiative to immediately correct the facial recognition algorithm
If you enter the name of a black man on Google
The webpage will also have a higher chance of showing off advertisements related to crime
This makes people wonder if the algorithm is neutral?
Or will the algorithm replicate the prejudice and inequality in the real world?
A 2016 research survey pointed out
None of the top ten tech companies in Silicon Valley employs black women
Three companies have no blacks at all, six companies have no female executives at all
And the executives are all white men
So the algorithms and products designed by Google
It actually reflects the values ​​of white American men
For example, the technological anxiety that “artificial intelligence may generate consciousness and rule humans”
It actually reflects the anxiety of the top white men
Because only they are faced with high-tech products that monitor data with algorithms every day
The general public is worried about the rent and living expenses for next month
I don’t have time to worry about whether the robot will have consciousness
If the people who design algorithm technology products are all wealthy white men
Of course the things they design cannot be diverse
The opposite of
If the programmer is black or female
We may get different search results when we use Google
So in 2018
Tens of thousands of Google employees launched a global strike
Protest Google's gender inequality and workplace sexual harassment
Many engineers began to reflect: Who is the algorithm for?
Because sometimes the algorithms designed by white men
It turned out to be aimed at plundering the bottom people
Like the admissions unit of American universities
Will use algorithms to find the disadvantaged class of low-income households to place admissions advertisements
Because these people at the bottom are most eager to flip up the class and move up.
So seeing the admissions advertisement is most likely to get the bait
As a result, many poor people go to university on school loans
According to statistics, more than half of the students drop out after 4 months
Not only didn’t get a degree, but also took a loan
Simply put
The rich design algorithms to abduct the poor to apply for unaffordable student loans
In recent years, there have also been more and more incidents of engineers opposing the inequality algorithm
For example, in 2018, the U.S. Immigration Service wanted to outsource the project to Microsoft.
But the U.S. did not allow child refugees at the U.S.-Mexico border to enter the U.S.
So hundreds of Microsoft engineers protested
Wrote an open letter to Microsoft
Ask Microsoft to cancel its contract with the USCIS
In the same year, 4,000 employees of Google also jointly signed
Rejection of the commission of the U.S. military
Require technology companies to no longer serve military units
The American Association for Computer Machinery (ACM) even published ethical principles in 2018
Ask the engineer to identify the job the boss wants him to do
Is it possible to cause potential harm or abuse
Hope to use ethical values ​​to transform the industrial culture of information technology
So the author pointed out:
The subjects found by the algorithm during the testing phase
It should be sufficiently representative to reflect different genders, classes and races
Technology companies must also provide enough channels for users to report negative experiences
It’s like we don’t let a new car that hasn’t been crash tested directly on the road
same
We also shouldn’t let the algorithm go online without a multiplicity-tested algorithm
In 1953, IBM built the world's first computer that could be mass-produced
The software was free when the computer was first sold
Software is included when you buy hardware
And users can also modify the software after use to provide feedback
The most famous case at the time was the early MIT computer laboratory
A hacker culture popular among MIT students
Like to solve problems by writing programs and does not require financial returns
The earliest computer game "Space War" in history was written in cooperation with MIT at that time
So when the computer industry first appeared
It’s a hardware manufacturer that develops software together with the user community
But with the increasing sales of personal computers
When the hardware becomes cheaper and easier to obtain
IBM began to sell hardware and software separately in 1969
Independently sold "proprietary software" began to appear
Open source code that could be accessed by users
Has been changed to a trade secret that users don’t know
The advent of proprietary software completely changed the entire programming circle
Programming is no longer based on user interests
And become serving the interests of the enterprise
Since the 1970s
Open source software has become less and less
Bill Gates, a strong proponent of proprietary software in 1976
I wrote an open letter to the engineer community saying:
The hardware has to be paid but the software has to be shared
Who cares if software engineers get paid?
Who would be willing to spend three years writing programs to catch errors and share the results for free?
This behavior is simply stealing!
And this year is also the time when the United States began to implement the new copyright law
Finally in 1979
The mainstream operating system Unix takes the last shot
Change the content of the authorization agreement: prohibit users from reading and changing the original code
The idea of ​​software copyright has become mainstream in the industry
But soon there was controversy in the engineer community
American engineer Richard Stallman (Richard Stallman) designed the program with a friend
As a result, my friend sold the jointly developed software to a private company
As a result, the programs he wrote were restricted by copyright law and he could no longer rewrite the programs he created
I can’t use the products that I have created and restrict me in turn
This kind of experience is what Marx calls "alienated labor"
The hacker culture of the original online world
It promotes the development of science and technology through collective cooperation to write programs
But capitalism is for corporate profits
It even used the law to prohibit engineers from obtaining source code to prohibit them from designing better programs
Richard Stallman launched the "Free Software Movement" out of anger
Freedom means to make the software better so that every engineer has the freedom to rewrite the software
Because collective research and development can create more efficient and better software for users
Instead of letting the software be owned by a private company
So Stallman himself created a new system: GNU
Find a lawyer to set up a set of free software laws called "General Public License Terms" (GPL)
All users can freely share and change the version of the program
But if you want to take the code written in GNU
You must comply with this clause and open the source code of the program you wrote to the public
So the source code is like a kind of "digital shared wealth"
The copyright of the capital enterprise will write "All rights reserved"
But the copyright of free software is copyleft: "reverse all rights"
In the past, economics believed that human nature was self-interested
For example, the civics class in high schools often mentions the "tragic song of shared wealth"
I think if the grass is public, everyone will bring cows to eat the grass
Only taking care of one's own interests caused overgrazing, and finally there was no grassland.
The best solution is to privatize the land
Everyone will take care of the land for their own benefit
So private property rights can improve economic efficiency
This is the view that Bill Gates supports
But Elinor Ostrom, the Nobel laureate in economics, discovered
In fact, the human community will come up with innovative ways to collectively manage shared resources.
Capital companies believe that if the source code is open, everyone can get it
Then no one would want to pay
Everyone will just sit back and enjoy their achievements and there will be a "tragic song of shared wealth"
But in fact, the result of the development of the "free software movement" is completely opposite.
Because every user encounters different problems
So when the source code is open
Everyone can report the problem and the inadequate modification
It will make the program more perfect
Many people in the industry also admit that Linux system performance is better than Windows
The engineer community even discovered a rule:
The more people read the source code, the faster the problem will be found out and the faster it will be solved.
This is called "Linus' Law" (Linus' Law)
In other words, the best way to debug is to be transparent and open
By contrast
Closed source "proprietary software" is expensive and inefficient
It is often necessary to hire experts to catch bugs and check whether program vulnerabilities will be hacked
More dangerous is
Closed source code can allow companies to evade legal liability
Doing things that hurt society hasn't been discovered yet
For example, Volkswagen was caught in 2015
Use cheating software when testing car emissions
So you can evade environmental regulations
These cheating software are trade secrets protected by copyright
So no one knows what the code content is
Capitalism originally claimed to be the most efficient economic system
But the history of software development has shown us
Capital companies compete for profit
Prefer to use closed source code that is less efficient and may even harm society
It prevents programmers from solving software problems in a more creative and collaborative way
Also hinders the prosperity of the information age
In this video we introduce five key issues in the digital age
Internet monopoly of technology companies, state surveillance, surveillance capitalism
Unequal algorithmic software copyright disputes
The author also put forward various possible solutions to these problems
Digital citizenship, digital autonomy and digital common wealth
There are many lawyers, engineers and hackers in today’s technology community who are practicing these concepts.
If you want to know more about hot topics in digital technology
I highly recommend you to read this "Human Rights Speculation in the Digital Age"
