Remy, what do you want for Christmas and Hanukkah?
>> That's Noah, my four-year-old daughter. She's talking to her twin brother, Remy. a a tulip, a cape, and a new light and a I'm Rosie and this is the Wire Cutter Show. We are nearly through our holiday gifting series where we've been featuring product recommendations, gifting advice, and listener questions all about giving to those you love over the holidays. The other episodes in this series are admittedly geared toward grown-ups. But in my experience, kids are perhaps the most complicated recipients on a gift list. almost always discerning, committed to honest feedback, specific about what they want, and sometimes incredibly unspecific.
>> Noah, what did I like for Christmas and Hanukkah? Um, I like a princess thing with um and then a spooky present for Hanukkah, which with a golden medal, and then a surprise.
>> So, today we're going straight to the source. I'm going to talk to real life kids about what they like and don't like to help you get a sense of what might make good gifts for the kids in your life. I sat down with three kids, Dior, age 8, Robinson, age 11, and Chloe, who's specifically 6 and 3/4. These kids are from different places. They celebrate different holidays, but one thing they all have in common is that they're kids who love presents. Shocker. These three told me what they've got on their list this year, and I showed them each an age appropriate wire cutter gift guide to get their take on our picss to see how our expert recommendations are received by the real experts. And now,
>> a beautiful dressful dress up and some fancy shoes and some gloves.
>> On to the main event.
>> And sparkly shoes and sparkly gloves and Legos and a new book. Okay.
>> Okay, buddy. We'll be right back. Welcome back. You're about to meet my new friend, Dior, who it turns out wants just about everything she can name off the top of her head for the holidays this year. Let's see if we can narrow down her list a little bit. Check it out. My name is Dior and I am 8 years old.
>> So we are going to talk about the holidays. Will you tell me what holidays you celebrate?
>> I celebrate Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's Day.
>> For Christmas, let's just take Christmas as an example. What do you do to celebrate? Um, so usually we'll have a Christmas party on Christmas Eve and my family will come and Yeah.

>> What have you started doing your own nails?
>> Yeah. Yeah.

>> I usually would just do some on my mom or like do some on my dolls, like starting to paint nails, but now I really want to start doing acrylic nails.
>> That's so cool. So, this nail kit that's on your list, what is it like?
>> So, there's like a fake can where you can like either paint it or do acrylics on it and stuff like that.
>> I got you. I got you. Okay, that sounds amazing. What else is on your list?

>> Probably like more chew toys and stuff cuz she likes chewing on stuff a lot.
>> That's kind of nice. That That's not even a present for you. It's a present for your dog.
>> Uh-huh.
>> Okay. So, that may be even something that you would give.
>> Mhm.
>> All right. What else?

>> Is it like literally like a baby that you hold in your arms and you can like dress it and stuff?
>> Yeah.
>> Does it cry?
>> No.
>> Oh, that's good.
>> So, I'll show you some things that are in our guide. and you tell me like if you would be excited about them or if you think maybe even your friends would could be excited for them. This is a drawing tablet. Do you like to draw?
>> Yeah, I love to draw.
>> Yeah. So, do what do you usually like to draw with?
>> Probably like some scratching pads or like whiteboards. I don't really use paper.
>> So, I feel like a tablet could be
>> Yeah.
>> kind of fun. All right. So, yes to the tablet. We're cooking. Let's see what else we have on this list. Oh, you might be into this. We got some white classic white slip-on Vans.
>> Yeah.
>> You have outfits that would go with these?
>> Yeah.
>> Do you like ice cream?
>> Yeah.
>> Would you make ice cream?
>> Yeah.
>> In an ice cream maker.
>> If you opened this and it was like you got an ice cream maker. What would you like? How long would it be until you ran to the kitchen and made ice cream?
>> Um, probably 5 minutes.
>> Yeah, that seems reasonable. Have you ever seen one of these? Yeah. At my school.
>> A lava lamp.
>> Uhhuh.
>> What? Would you want one though?
>> Yeah.
>> You'd be excited about that?
>> Uh-huh.
>> Well, so we know that you like ice cream. Do you like cookies?
>> I love cookies.
>> So, this is like a cookie subscription. Like a box of cookies. Just like you open it up.
>> Yay.
>> So, the people at home can't see your face, but I think you just got like really excited hearing about the cookies.
>> Uh-huh.
>> Yeah. Okay, cool. So, that'd be a good gift. Do you like stuffies?
>> I love stuffies.
>> I love stuffies. Nobody loves stuffies more than I love stuffies, but maybe you're second. Um, this stuffy is a capy bear. It's really cute. What's your favorite animal?
>> Um, a dog.
>> Chanel.
>> Yeah,
>> specifically.
>> Yeah.
>> Love it. So, what Oh my gosh. What if you got a stuffy that looked like Chanel?
>> I would die for it.
>> Okay, fair enough. Me, too.
>> Oh, I have one more question. What do you like to give for gifts? What are you going to give your parents? Probably for my mom, I will give her like slippers, pajamas cuz she loves PJs.
>> Nice.
>> And then for my dad, probably like a journal book and some new clothes because he's trying to start a business and he can write down all his plans.
>> I love that. That is so thoughtful. If it was for my cousin, it would probably be like those hair mannequin things because she loves doing dolls hair and probably a makeup kit cuz she loves using makeup.
>> How old is your cousin?
>> 10.
>> So, is this what you're going to be doing next year if you come back and we talk about gifts?
>> Yeah.
>> Happy holidays, Sior. I hope you have such a good time with your friends and family.
>> You too. I think it's going to be hard to go wrong with gifts for Dior this year, but specifically gifts that are nail adjacent. Gifts about dogs, cookies, all winners. Good stuff, Dior. Okay, next up, we're growing up. My new pal Robinson has some ideas about what might be on a pre-teen boys radar, and he's definitely got thoughts about what is not. Let's hear it. I'm Robinson. I uh technically 11. I turned 11 5 days ago.
>> Tell me about your family. Who is in your family and what holiday?
>> I have a brother. He's 14. Uh my mom with my dad. We do Christmas, Hanukkah.
>> So, what's your feeling about gifting? Do you like receiving gifts or giving gifts or equal measure?
>> Equal measure. because there's the satisfaction of knowing you you gave the best gift and there's also the satisfaction of getting a good gift.
>> I could not agree more. How do you figure out what you're going to gift to your parent for instance?
>> That's honestly kind of hard because the way I would give to like my mom or my dad is my for instance if I'm giving a gift to my dad, my mom will tell me what my dad wants and that's how it works because I mean I don't have as much of a understanding in that way.
>> Got it. Is that the same with your brother too?
>> No, I I know my brother better.
>> Really? Okay. So, tell me, what are 14-year-olds into?
>> Honestly, we are into very similar things.
>> Okay, hit me.
>> Pokémon video games, uh, Legos. We both like Legos a lot. DND, which is a Dungeons and Dragons. It's like they have a lot of different things you can buy and waste your money on. Pokémon cards.
>> Take me through your list. Let's keep on Christmas for a minute.
>> Generally, my birthday just happened and some honestly making lists is kind of hard because I have to find out what I actually want. But the main thing,
>> how do you find out what you want?
>> Uh, well, for instance, Pokemon, I just like keep on track with like the news of the what's happening. Legos, I get a Lego magazine every month.
>> Nice.
>> And for books, I just honestly normally I just see a book that I think might be good, ask for it.
>> What kind of books do you like to read?
>> Honestly, I read a lot of manga, shownen manga as a category.
>> Nice. Yeah.
>> So, you're just in bookstores and you're sort of subtly pointing things out like, "Hey,
>> no, no,
>> my birthday." No,
>> like I put them on the list. Books aren't as major presents, so you can expect to get more.
>> Got you. I got you.
>> The best good way to get like certain presents is you point out an expensive present, then point out less expensive present after. But there is also this thing that is this much. They're more likely to go for that. Yay.
>> You are giving away all your secrets.
>> Well, my mom's not going to hear this. Right. Right.
>> I didn't say that. So, I want to show you this. So, we have um we have guides,
>> the guide of things for me to critique and
>> so be gentle. So, look through and just tell me what do you think about what's here?
>> Baby napling, a fuzzy big blanket, I guess.
>> Yeah. So, you're playing your video games and you're on the couch or whatever. Are you snuggling with this blanket or not? Not really.
>> 7 lb. What
>> are you a weighted blanket person or no?
>> I not really. Okay.
>> But I do like them. But $140 for a blanket?
>> A weighted blanket?
>> That's crazy though. That's absurd. I was like, "This is somewhat good idea, but $140 is too much."
>> I got you,
>> brother. What is it? I've never done sewing ever.
>> Okay, so pass.
>> Now we're some Now we're some What are you looking at?
>> Lego chest set. Chess is a great game. Legos Legos are great. Yes. $75. What a great deal.
>> Okay, that's a yes.
>> 100%. Anybody could build this. Anybody could play it. Uh, acrylic paint set.
>> Do you paint?
>> No, I do not. I don't know what acrylic does. I've never done like been been into like a lot of art and stuff. It's $19, so it's good.
>> Okay. The vibe I'm getting from you is that the value is important. So, the thing has to be okay.
>> Planet. It's a board game. Have I played this? Players take turns adding magnetic tiles terrains to their planet. Based on the terrain, they also play an cards. All right. That actually, yes, I kind of like that. Honestly,
>> you'd be into that.
>> I would play that. I bet after I understand it, I'd play.
>> Right. And now we're going to end on on Lego again.
>> That That is fine.
>> So, what's the what's the vibe here? What are we looking at?
>> Okay. So, Lego Creator Bird 3 in one birdhouse. All right. So, you can transform into a beehive and a park bench for a squirrel and hedgehog. Now, this actually looks really nice and fun to build because yeah, it's three in one, which I honestly like those. Awesome.
>> Yes, I would take this.
>> Cool.
>> Good.
>> Thanks, Robinson.
>> All right.
>> Okay. So, for precocious boys in the pre-teen range, what I'm hearing is Legos and maybe anime and definitely video games. Most important, you've got to be thinking about value people. Next up, we've got a first grader who already has a lot of things on Wire Cutter's list. So, let's see if we can find something new she'd be interested in.
>> My name is Chloe and I'm 6 and 3/4.
>> So, tell me, Chloe, what holidays you celebrate?
>> I celebrate Christmas and New Year's.
>> What is Christmas like at your house?
>> I don't do it at my house. I go to my grandma and grandpa's house. They have a lot more space and we don't have a Christmas tree.
>> Do you give presents or do you get presents then? I open presents.
>> And who gives you presents? Usually.
>> Usually my mom or my grandpa and grandma.
>> Your mom and your grandpa and grandma. Okay.
>> And my dad.
>> Let's not forget your dad. So, have you thought about what you might want for Christmas this year? What's on the list?
>> I have a lot of things.
>> All right. Hit me. I'm I'm ready.
>> First thing is like I have one of these at my grandma and grandpa's house, but it moves too fast, so I got a slower one. And it's like this remote control snake and it's like I can move it wherever I want.
>> A remote control snake. So it's on the ground and it slithers around your house.
>> Yeah,
>> that sounds creepy. What else is on the list?
>> A sleeping bag. I already have one, but it's like the pillow is like it's like pops up, so I want a different one.
>> And what's what color? What color are you asking for? What's your favorite color? It's a unicorn one.
>> It's got to be a unicorn one. I love a unicorn. Okay, so we got sleeping bag. We've got remote control snake. What else would make you just so excited?
>> A Barbie doll house. I already have Barbie doll playing. But now I I want to get a Barbie doll house.
>> How many Barbies do you have?
>> 1,000.
>> A thousand Barbies. Okay. So, would you be happy or not happy if you also got another Barbie?
>> Not happy.
>> Really? I don't have a thousand, but it's like I'm saying a thousand because there's a lot.
>> There's a lot. Okay, I got you. What else?
>> A panda that has like this little baby bottle and also it comes with a toilet.
>> That sounds really silly and very fun.
>> It also has a diaper.
>> So, what are you gonna change this panda's diaper? Oh, brother. Okay. So, can I show you some of these gifts? And I want to see what you think. We can just look at these and I want to see like if you think that you would want something like this or your friends
>> who are also six. So, this is a inner tube. Like this is a snow tube. Do you go snow tubing in the winter at all?
>> I only sled down sled.
>> Only sled. So, would you be excited if you got a sled?
>> I already have one.
>> Well, there we go. Moving on. What is this?
>> I don't. That's a bicycle with three wheels, but I already know how to ride a two-wheel bicycle. So, no.
>> So, what I'm hearing is you got to make sure if you're going to give a six-year-old a bike, you got to make sure that they don't have a bike and that they don't already know how to ride one cuz you already know.
>> Yeah, that's too easy.
>> It's too easy. Got it. Magnetiles. Are you into them?
>> I already have some.
>> How do you feel about building stuff? Do you like to build stuff?
>> Yeah. So things like this or Legos.
>> I build a I sort Legos a lot more and I build them.
>> Uhhuh.
>> So if I had to pick between this and Legos, I would choose Legos cuz I sort them more and play with them more.
>> I got you. How about painting? Do you like to paint?
>> Yeah.
>> So if you got a paint set, that would be cool. too many paints. But if there was like a outline or something, I would paint it inside. Yeah,
>> I love it. It sounds like new markers and craft supplies could be a hit with 6-year-old Chloe.
