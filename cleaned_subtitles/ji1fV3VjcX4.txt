Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lord's Podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.
Today you are going to be, listening or
watching a special episode of our podcast,
recorded live at a conference
which you've probably never seen before.
Yeah, this was at,
the Lazard Forsquare Conference,
and we interviewed Dmitry Shevelenko
He is the chief business
officer of Perplexity, which is something
you might have used before.
We certainly use it.
Yep. One of the leading AI models.
This is a conference
related to media and dealmaking.
And so we talked about
what is going to be the impact of
AI on brands, on the news
and on the internet as we know it.
So, take a listen.
We also took questions from the audience.
So you will hear us referring to questions
that we are receiving on the app.
We hope you enjoy. Take a listen.
Sorry about the music
 people
either love or hate the music.
Okay, so just a reminder,
this is being recorded,
so if you could keep it moderately quiet,
you know, you can laugh,
you can clap, do all of that, scream
if you need to.
Just don't rearrange the furniture
and things like that.
And also reminder
we're taking questions from the audience
throughout this discussion.
So if you send them on the app,
we will see them and be able to ask
Demetry and if we're looking
at our phones, that's our excuse.
Yeah.
We're engaged in the question.
We're engaged in the interview.
All right. So here's my first question.
Should we even be talking to you?
What I mean by that is
I could just go on Perplexity
and ask all these questions, and
then we'll give me a pretty decent answer.
What's the point?
So, first of all, thank you for having me.
It's great to be here.
The, the the
I love that that tee up
and you guys are scheming backstage of,
like, what's going to be the heart
opening question, but I love it
because the thing that humans
will always be
uniquely exceptional
at is asking questions.
So perplexity may have the answer,
but perplexity does not have
an innate desire to be curious.
And that's what you guys have.
And that's why journalism is so important,
and that's why having these conversations
is important.
It's about the questions,
not necessarily the answers.
Kind of related to this, I guess.
But here's the thing
that I always think about, which is I'm,
I enjoy using perplexity, etc..
Let's say, you know,
you have great relationships
with all the news publishers, etc.
and the really cool thing,
all and all those deals get solved, etc.
like, why do we need the internet
as we know it has web
things called websites built for humans.
Now that we're in this age
where we can go to a, chat
bot or something like it,
and the answer is right there,
do we need to have what are traditionally
called websites anymore?
Why would a publisher continue to invest
in design and all of these things?
When I could just get the answer from,
perplexity or ChatGPT or whatever else?
So again, it goes
back to
I think the reason we're drawn to media
properties is because of the questions
that journalists and editors are asking.
Right? It's it's not necessarily
it's the framing.
It is the
what is actually worth asking about.
What's worth reading about.
Yeah.
Perplexity doesn't have answers to that.
Okay.
You have to come to perplexity
already armed with a question.
And oftentimes people, you know, read news
and there's something
they didn't understand fully
and they come to a perplexity
to get that deeper understanding.
But the spark, that comes
from editorial judgment,
that comes from the intuition
of a world class reporter.
And that's why we're excited through,
you know, programs like comment plus,
to, to find new business models for that.
How do you actually judge editorial
judgment or quality of news sources?
Because I can imagine a future
where a lot of our news consumption
is through
something like a perplexity model,
which means that you're basically the
arbiter of what information is reliable.
So how do you make those decisions?
It's it's not me at the, at the wheel.
You know, ultimately this is where
we focus, a big part of our technology.
It's building accurate AI.
The thing that we believe is
that's going to be most
scarce in the future is not intelligence.
It's trust.
I think the bedrock of trust
is transparency.
That's why perplexity pioneered,
showing you exactly which source
the information is coming from
and empowering users to apply their own
judgment of whether that is a good source
or not so good source.
But we deploy many different
algorithmic strategies.
Oftentimes if many, publications
are saying the same thing,
you know, that's a strong signal
that they're on to something.
And, you know, the outliers,
you're kind of more, sensitive to,
but this isn't,
you know, it's not a simple problem.
And this is why, you know,
we raise a lot of capital and hire
the world's best technologists
to build accurate AI.
So I think anyone could sort of
intuitively understand why publishers
might be anxious about perplexity
as being a destination.
Evidently, it's not just news publishers.
Literally.
When since we got on the stage in a three
minutes ago, news broke that Amazon
demands perplexity to stop AI from stop AI
agent from making purchases.
It literally just broke three minutes ago
from Bloomberg.
What is the.
It's not just news that's anxious
about the idea of perplexity
being the destination.
Clearly it's, all kinds of businesses.
So I think, and I haven't read the article
yet, but I'm going to read it out.
All right.
I think I have an understanding
of the issues.
Yeah.
The, ultimately the issue
with, with Amazon is tied to perplexities
web browser called comment.
And comment is a web browser
that has an AI assistant built into it.
And what we think is important
is that consumer and end users
have access to powerful
AI when they are accessing,
publications, accessing websites,
accessing the internet.
The first 30 years of the internet,
we had lopsided AI where big tech,
you know, Google, Netflix, Facebook,
they used AI to control what we see,
to get us to click on certain things
and not click on other things.
And what is changing now is perplexity
is focusing on giving powerful
AI to the end user.
And we think
this is the right thing to do.
We think it's a principled viewpoint
that when you're on Amazon,
it's not Amazon's business.
Whether you're using AI to help you
evaluate, is this the best thing to buy?
You know,
can I find it cheaper somewhere else?
Do I actually need to buy the other thing
they're telling me to buy with it?
The world's wealthiest
people, they have personal shoppers
that help them do this.
And we're democratizing
that sort of intelligence,
that sort of assistant access to everyone.
Just in terms of competition
is the argument, basically,
that technically, you know, a Google
or an Amazon could create similar products
to what you guys are doing, but their
own business model basically prohibits
them from doing what you're doing.
I should have you join
our next investor pitch is exactly that.
It is,
there is a big opening for an independent,
neutral AI player
that is aligned with users.
You know, Google is still,
you know, they're generating, you know,
100 billion, in revenue per quarter,
which is amazing.
But a lot of that is coming from getting,
you know, adver.
Yeah, their customers, advertisers,
you know, Amazon,
they're trying to get you to buy
as many things as possible.
Our success metric is the users.
Are they willing to pay
for a perplexity subscription?
And so we're purely
aligned with our users.
When speaking of competition,
like what is the differentiator?
Okay, maybe Amazon has some
obvious, angles and some of the others.
OpenAI seems sort of independent
in the same bucket.
It's really huge.
It's one of the biggest websites
in the in the world.
It doesn't strike me.
Many of the, things
that they offer replicate seem
sort of similar to perplexity.
You must get this.
I don't know, you know,
private stock. Answer this.
But what is the differentiator
between you and, and, and OpenAI?
So, you know, I,
I'm fortunate to get to speak with a lot
of curious people that have to answer
a lot of hard questions every day.
And they're they tell me
they use perplexity.
And it comes back to
we're focused on accuracy above all else.
ChatGPT is an amazing product.
But they built a product
that is optimized for engagement.
It's trying to be your cheerleader,
your coach.
It's trying to get you to to keep going.
And they've also built a product
that is designed not to use the best,
in service of your
question,
but it's designed to use their lives,
and so part of being neutral, part
of being independent,
trustworthy, accurate
is using the best possible technology
to answer the question
in the best possible way.
And so being an aggregator of all the best
models, having our own independent
search infrastructure, that isn't the Bing
search API, which is what, ChatGPT uses,
those are all the building blocks
of a more useful, accurate AI.
What's your actual revenue source
at this point?
Because I know you're
big on subscriptions.
You experimented with ads.
I think you might have paused
that at this point,
but it does seem if you're trying
to be different to Google,
you probably don't want to be as ad driven
as they are.
Yeah.
So we're seeing tremendous traction
with both consumer subscriptions
and then companies buying the enterprise
version of perplexity for their employees.
Ultimately,
it's in that enterprise context
where having accurate,
useful knowledge is incredibly valuable.
And so, you know, we've had, you know,
we've been fortunate
with a enterprise
go to market team of just five people.
You know, seen that business, you know,
more more than eight acts this year,
seeing, you know, many multiples increase
in our consumer subscriptions.
And we're excited about building products,
that are user aligned,
that also create marketing value
for brands and advertisers.
But this isn't going to be rebuilding
AdWords and click based systems.
We think it's important
to create real value
so that when your personal
AI agent, powered by perplexity,
is evaluating a potential commercial
opportunity, it's something you might buy.
Imagine, you know, alongside the answer,
you got an offer for an exclusive discount
that would be something
that your agent would say,
hey, this is even though this someone's
paying for this to show up here.
This is actually a good deal.
If it's just an ad that says
click me, click me, click me,
we don't think
that's going to be sustainable.
And that's not the type of marketing
products we're looking to build.
Can we talk a little bit
about the fundraising environment for
I mean, obviously we know how crazy,
you know, intense things are,
are people throwing cash at you
as you walk down the street?
But also, it feels like every day, like,
I like it used to be
when I paid attention to startups,
it felt like there were discrete rounds.
There was a seed and then an A, and then a
B and maybe a C and then an IPO.
When I read, it feels like every day
there is just it or the
are the rounds blending into each other.
So that is just the sort of ongoing stream
of oh, here's a do raise, etc..
We got some new chips
and then we are giving them some equity
and so has the has
the line between rounds.
Is it blurring.
Yeah.
So before perplexity
I mean, I spent most of my career
at consumer internet companies,
but a stint as,
a founder of a robotics startup and,
I is definitely a different
fundraising environment than that was,
which was, very challenging.
I think at its core,
a lot of investors believe in
and we agree with this belief that,
what's happening with AI now is
as profound as the original introduction
of the internet.
And so there are going to be a wave
of new generational companies
that are being built right now.
And, you know,
a lot of the value is actually,
you know,
compounding while these companies
are privately held, and so that that is
yeah, there's a lot of conviction, by,
by private investors in that,
I think a second piece is that investors
themselves are power
users of products like perplexity.
They are people that have
a lot of questions, do a lot of research.
And so they have not just an abstract
understanding of a balance sheet.
They have their own intuition,
you know, which is very different
than like B2B, SAS, where it's like,
you know, you have to go do 30
customer interviews and you're kind of
getting all the second order information,
you know, perplexity, use it yourself.
You understand
the value, the time that you just saved,
the creative expansion you just had.
And and that gives investors conviction.
And so that
that is, you know, fueling
this environment,
is that at times, you know, too frothy?
Sure.
You know, are there going to be some
investors that, that make the wrong bets?
Absolutely.
But the core human need
of getting good answers
to good questions, you know,
we think that is boundless.
And so we're, we're confident in the path
ahead.
Well, speaking of froth,
is there anyone you turn away
in terms of being an investor?
Yeah.
So there's this phenomenon,
that that tends to happen
in bubbly periods of,
multilayered SVS.
So SPV are special purpose vehicles.
And so you basically have many layers
of outsource fundraising
where you have,
you know, principal agent misalignment,
where the fundraiser
is not making money off the investment,
they're just making money
off the management fee.
And so we often get approach, from players
in that space.
And we, you know, whenever we can detect
that's what it is.
We, we avoid taking on funds like that
because we want investors,
who are getting direct access
to perplexity
and who are in it for the long haul,
who aren't just trying to make a quick
buck on on a management fee flip.
I want to talk about this more.
I'm really fascinated.
We actually we did an episode,
with a vlog ten of the Robinhood CEO,
and he was talking about tokenization
of private assets.
And I guess this sort of actually relates
to the question
about discreet rounds,
but does it feel like,
you know, in theory,
if some sort of slice of equity
in, perplexity, maybe people sell forwards
or these vehicles that are linked to it,
does it feel like the line
between what it means to be a private
and a public company
is inevitably going to disappear,
especially adding
the fact that we seem to be on this road
where public companies
will not be expected or required
to have to report information,
as timely as they used to.
I think it's important,
when you're a privately held company
to control the sale of your equity.
And I think the challenge, you know, why I
we haven't.
Yeah.
We've been approached
by a lot of these tokenization schemes.
And, you know, again,
if you have folks on your cap
table
that are not aligned for the long term.
Yeah, they may be looking for quick flips.
And then that creates
a weird signal in the market.
And that may harm,
you know, a primary race.
Right.
And so the the noise that comes with that
liquid, it's not like
we're short on other,
you know, investment, you know, avenues,
so it's just an unnecessary
kind of noise risk.
So, speaking of throwing money
around the $35
billion bid for Chrome was.
What was that? Was that a troll?
We that was when we made that bid.
The DOJ had still not decided,
whether Chrome would be divested,
from Google,
the web browser, as evidenced by,
you know, Amazon's,
behavior is clearly incredibly
valuable surface area,
and that, you know, 35
billion was the starting bid.
You know, like,
at this point, I can safely say
I think Chrome is worth more than that.
But what I can, confidently say is
we had more than 35 billion of investor
interest in making that bid.
So it was not a, constraint
on, you know, the funding side.
Obviously,
Google does not want to sell Chrome
unless they will be forced to,
and it doesn't look
like the government will be forcing them.
So you're serious about that one?
It's not just a sort of antitrust flag
waving exercise. No.
We had, you know, very large
sovereign wealth funds that, you know,
we're
we're kind of lined up and ready to go.
Here's a great question from,
someone anonymous via the app.
Can you talk about unit margins?
I you often hear this and it's like,
oh, these AI companies,
they're not even on a unit basis
making money given the compute costs,
etc., are
what can you talk about gross margins.
And right now, whether like, you know,
a given query is profitable given
the cost of delivering,
so the,
a paying pro subscriber to perplexity
is profitable for us.
Okay.
So the unit margins are strong.
The, you know, free users right now
because we do not monetize them.
Sure.
You know, we don't, you know,
we lose money on those,
AI companies.
I think
something that is underappreciated,
they generally actually, when they do that
counting of free users, they attribute
that to research and development,
because you're still using those prompts
to improve and train your system model.
So, you know,
it does allow for your unit economics
to potentially appear
more pristine than they are.
Are all pro users profitable?
Because this also strikes me as something
unique with AI, which is that,
you know, when back when Twitter
was in its infancy, power users were good.
It feels like in the case with AI,
sometimes you get these power users
where you're losing money on them.
Are all pro users
profitable, or do some use it so much
that it's more than the subscription fee?
I mean, I don't it's
not a material amount,
and we've also introduced a max tier.
So we have a $20 a month Pro subscription.
And for the folks that want, you know,
the most expensive reasoning models
and higher limits on them,
there's a $200 a month product called Max.
And then it also gets you access
to our email assistant.
And so I think you'll, you know,
and other companies
have also introduced
kind of higher tiers of subscription.
So this is not a problem
that's unique necessarily to AI.
And and you kind of introduce tiers
of service to to support it at scale.
What is your expenditure
actually look like at this point.
Like what
are you spending the most money on?
Is it we read about these insane salaries
for engineers
going to cloud or OpenAI or whatever.
Is it talent retention
or is it compute power?
Is it
the content deals with media organization.
What are you spending on?
So the biggest expense
is inference, right.
So it is the cost of compute.
When you're you're asking a question
and running, it through a, oh,
you know, that that is,
that is a material expenditure.
We, you know,
perplexity doesn't do pre-training.
So the sorts of AI PhDs
that other companies are,
you know, paying, you know, reported,
hundreds of millions of for,
we're not that that's
not we're not in the market for that.
We have incredible
AI application engineers and that's that's
what we recruit for.
Ultimately, engineers
that are joining perplexity
are joining because they believe
we're just getting started.
Right.
And they're coming for an equity
appreciation story.
That's, you know, already bearing fruit.
But we're just at the beginning
of that journey.
Maybe this is sort of a way
of restating Tracy's question,
but it all doesn't feel like any,
any AI conversation.
It's like, what is the bottleneck, right?
Yeah, right.
Is it talent?
Is it capital? Is it compute?
Is it power, etc.?
Like if you could have unlimited amounts
of any one of those things,
what would you want more of right now?
So I think it's important to bifurcate.
There is the companies
that do the training of foundation models.
And those are
the ones that are really pushing
for the massive infrastructure build out.
Yeah.
We're not constrained on compute
for inference,
at the current usage levels, but
as you know, behavior shift,
I mean, by a show of hands in the room,
like how many people have stopped
primarily using Google
when they have an informational question?
So, you know, about what 80% of the room,
you know, raise their hands
and we see the early adopter behavior
in you know, audiences like this,
you know, folks that work in financial
services, people that, again, for
for whom quickly
getting high quality information matters
as you know,
this behavior becomes more mainstream.
We obviously will need
more compute for inference.
But the
the folks that are kind of talking
about trillions of dollars in investment,
it's really a different universe
than ours.
I it's unclear to me
why some of those investments are needed.
Sometimes it feels like a strategy of,
you know, kind of
what what the US was trying to do
with the Soviet Union of just getting your
competitors to, go broke, by, you know,
being able to raise the most capital.
And we'll see how that plays out.
Since you mentioned financial services,
we have a good question from the audience.
We've done some media navel gazing.
I'm sure we're going to do some more,
but for now, financial services,
navel gazing.
What do you think
the impact of AI will be on places
like Lazard and other Wall Street firms?
I just think this is
going to be a incredible
flowering
of creativity and productivity lift.
I think of using a product like perplexity
and other AI tools in the day to day
of somebody that works on an investment
bank is really twofold.
The first is saving you 80% of the time,
to get to that 80%
first draft of a work product.
Right.
And investment banks, that's
kind of putting together pitch decks.
Doing modeling,
just gaining tremendous efficiency.
And it's not
it's important to distinguish it's
not about making that workflow autonomous.
You still absolutely need human judgment
on, you know,
what the end output
should be, how to approach it.
This is this is not about replacing
investment bankers.
It's about giving them
tremendous leverage.
I think the more disruptive impact
is now that
it got a lot easier to begin
a new initiative, to begin a new prospect,
how many more new engagements
are you going to be able to spin up?
Right.
Because the biggest constraint
on new business
is an employee feeling
they have the bandwidth to take it on.
And and, you know, experience leaders
now have much more leverage.
And I think that's going to play
a profound role at Lazard.
And you know, part of why I'm excited
to be part of the organization,
I love these audience questions
because they're, saying things that
I would think that reminded me
and that I would have been rude to say.
You didn't answer the first question
about, are you going to kill journalism?
But someone says you didn't
answer the first question,
how would journalism survive?
When I had skin that I get,
oh yeah, you know,
I isn't interested in asking questions,
but that's not the question is like,
why would brands continue to, like,
build out these presents for like a human
reading and scrolling when I can just
go to one destination that doesn't
necessarily click me anywhere else?
Well, I mean, when I look at the earnings
numbers for the Wall Street Journal,
The New York Times, for Bloomberg
media companies seem to be doing fine.
New York Times is doing well.
So games and I don't know
if you get earnings numbers for.
But what I, what I hear.
Yeah like some subscription numbers.
But by the way
yeah I was doing a lot more than games.
I actually didn't know
there. It's a very impressive company.
But by and large I it does not look like
the actual news business.
It's a lifestyle
company is doing particularly well.
But I think it's it's
part of the value of the bundle.
I mean, it's, I mean, this is a very
this is very analogous
to when the internet was first introduced.
You had traditional brick
and mortar retailers and the best brick
and mortar retailers
adapted to the digital environment.
And the best publishers are adapting
and gaining leverage.
With I mean, last night we had,
the CEO, of Axel
Springer, talk
about how he's leaning into AI, and it's
actually an incredible opportunity
for productivity.
And so I, I don't think this is zero sum.
I do think there's going to be
some publishers that thrive and others,
and the media
business is already facing challenges,
you know, certain segments of it.
Well, before I, so I don't see this as
being kind of the fundamental tension.
But if you fast forward 5
or 10 years from now,
what is the front page of the internet
actually will look like to you?
And what exactly is I?
I guess the economic pact between
media and platforms such as yourself.
What would the ideal pact or agreement
actually look like?
Like how?
Basically, give me your vision
of the internet in five years,
we, we're introducing
something called Comet Plus,
which, we already have the Washington
Post and Condé Nast,
LA times,
many great publishers signed on for.
And it was really inspired by Apple
News Plus,
where if you are a Comet Plus subscriber,
which is $5 a month,
and we bundled into perplexity Pro
so even people that didn't necessarily,
you know, want to pay for it.
We're taking money out of our, cut and
feeding it into this program to see it.
As you consume premium content
in the comet browser,
we're then sharing that revenue back
proportionately with publishers,
and it's actually accounting for
not just page views of premium content,
but agent actions on that content
and citations in the comet browser.
And so ultimately, I think subscriptions
are a very powerful business model
for media.
I think there's a lot more to do there.
And we want to play a leading role
in doing that.
I'm very impressed by the,
the finance, module within perplexity.
You know,
there's a whole graveyard of companies
that have tried to take down our,
our employer and, at Bloomberg.
Do you see yourself
as a potential challenger company?
Tracy asked about,
you know, financial services, etc..
Do you see yourself at some point down
the road as a challenger to the terminal?
Yeah. I mean, how many people have access
to Bloomberg Terminal?
It's like, I mean, you guys like, it's
not it's not millions, right?
So yeah, it's not millions.
So for for us the success of Perplexity
Finance is it's similar
to what I was saying about with Amazon
and people that have personal shoppers
like Bloomberg Terminal.
Is that like it's this is like we know
it's very lucrative is hiring a company.
And so when you're thinking
about the lazards of the world
and all the other banks,
could you at some point see yourself
pitching perplexity or perplexity terminal
as a where
all these other ones had failed to do it?
I think for us, the bigger picture,
the bigger opportunity is not to go
after Bloomberg Terminal.
It's giving everyone who can't afford
Bloomberg Terminal
a version of it that is useful for them.
And when they're making retail stock
investment decisions,
when they're understanding
the interplay of the markets
and the news cycle, that they have access
to powerful technology.
Right.
So it's not I don't think
we can't like Bloomberg Terminal.
Like people are there for the chatting.
Like there's all kinds of features there
that we're not trying to replace.
Thank you.
And it's an amazing product and, amazing
brand.
I think it's for us, this is about
democratizing and expanding the scope
of who has access to premium
financial intelligence.
Another question from the audience.
This one's from Olivier.
Olivia on, what do you think will be
the key skill sets for media entertainment
executives to manage the impact
of AI on content industries?
I mean,
I think, my answer to this is the answer.
I think it's a key skill set
for any professional in the age of AI
is you have to get really good
at asking the right questions.
And so that means asking your teams,
why are they working on
what they're working
on, what's the leverage?
What's the unique differentiation.
And so is approaching their business
with a profound curiosity,
and an understanding that, you know,
there are new disruption
and leverage opportunities
and to kind of lead with that curiosity.
Everyone always says that.
But what does a good prompt
actually look like to you?
Can you give us a specific example of
like a prompt that really impressed you?
I think to me, asking you
a good question is like a level deeper
than like
the prompt engineering is, is kind of
that that in some ways will get abstracted
very soon.
When I say asking good question,
it means a question that embodies
and embeds
all the known knowledge on a given topic.
And the question you're asking is then,
you know, where do you push the frontier?
Like what is what is the the thing
that is not yet knowable, that in your
question you're pushing your organization
on, you know, going back to,
the browser question
about the bid for Chrome, Google itself
earlier this year,
there are a lot of people like, oh,
Google is going to get disrupted by AI.
And it's a classic innovator's dilemma.
They invented all this tech
and they're not making.
Now the stock market views Google's done
phenomenally or alphabet.
They've done phenomenally well.
And a lot of people
have really changed their tune on them.
If the browser is such an important
part of the real estate
here,
does that just give them a massive leg up?
I mean,
I know you're going to have your own
and OpenAI is going to have its own,
but Chrome is everywhere.
Like how that sounds like a very big Mo.
It's a very powerful
distribution leverage point.
But their greatest strength
is is also a weakness
in that they built it around
a AdWords system where they're reliant on
people clicking on links.
And the behavior of clicking on promoted
links will just matter less in the future
of the internet than it has in the past.
Speaking of promoted links is another
question I've been wondering about.
Sometimes I see these companies
and they advertise on LinkedIn,
and they offer what I think is sort of
would be the equivalent of like
the AI equivalent of SEO.
Is that all snake oil is there,
like whatever is, does that exist?
Can are there
these games that publishers or any brands
can play to do well in AI,
or is that sort of a fraud?
I don't want to call it a fraud.
I have not, uncovered,
those
companies provide analytics,
but they're not actionable.
Okay.
And so I have not found an actionable
output there.
And in some ways,
our purpose is to prevent those
insights from being actionable.
Because if you can game
a perplexity answer,
it means is not accurate and trustworthy.
And so, you know, if they do find a hack,
like we have better engineers
that will, fill that hack,
I have a slightly philosophical question,
but is there any way to inject
a tiny bit of randomness or creativity
in some of, perplexity output?
And what I mean by that is,
I think at this point, we're all aware of,
algorithmic content, moderation.
And the idea that if you start
your Netflix account and you watch one
romantic comedy for the rest of your life,
Netflix is going to be throwing like
Matthew McConaughey films
at you forever and ever and ever.
How do you deal with that aspect of it?
The risk that people are funneled into,
like one particular answer stream
or one quarter of the internet.
So memory will be an important feature
of products like perplexity.
And the
way we avoid that trap is transparency,
just like we do with sources,
where we actually show you
all of the things
that we've added to your memory.
And if you don't want to be pigeonholed
as a romantic
comedy lover, you just delete that memory.
And I mean, I, I'm kind of,
I recently got into health supplements,
and now every time I ask about health
supplements, my decision to begin,
you know, pomegranate supplements
is getting mentioned.
The answer and, yeah.
And I, Yeah, I deleted that
because I'm like, you know what?
I don't want to, like coming back
to the pomegranates.
As great as they are,
and that was, you know, that
that I just went and deleted that memory.
I saw where it was.
And, you know,
I'm pomegranate free in my answers.
There's a question
here about, let's see the comparison
to the first wave of the internet.
So this person is talking
about content creation,
AI agent Studios, pace of change, moving
very fast.
I mean, is decision.
What's really extraordinary to me
about the last several
years is the speed with which we seem
to get new paradigms right.
Blogs were one or going to be a big deal.
That was 20 years ago.
They had a life span of a few years then,
you know, social media, Twitter, etc.
there's been how do you think about,
things get, overturned so fast these days?
How do you think about making investment
decisions
under such conditions of uncertainty?
Yeah.
This is, I mean, a funny time
to to drop his name, but this is where
we love the Jeff Bezos line of,
you know, it's the hard thing
to predict is not what's going to change,
but what's going to remain the same.
I think from our
vantage point,
the bedrock is accuracy and trust.
Right.
And that's actually as intelligence
gets much more powerful.
It's gets more powerful manipulating us.
And so that's why kind of that
trust bedrock, is paramount.
That said,
one of my,
you know, management, mantras is that
I have absolute conviction
that six months from now,
I'm going to have a top three priority,
that today I don't know what it is.
And that embedded in
that is an understanding that
even the model makers themselves,
when they release a new model
until it's out,
they don't know what emergent capabilities
and what the useful applications of that
will be.
Yeah.
And so kind of, you know, having core
foundational principles
while at the same time
preserving agility and adaptability
and being the best at applying
the new gifts we get,
for the service of users that
that's going to be a key operating skill.
There's a second part of that
audience question that Joe just asked.
And I think it's it's probably
the one that's on all of our minds,
and it's the bluntest one.
But is is I in a bubble?
There are certainly parts of it
that that are not you obviously
your competitors, presumably.
Right.
I mean, I think of all of the time
and leverage that
professionals and knowledge
workers are getting
and I, I to me
the ROI on that
like I can see the trillions of dollars
and economic productivity
happening from it.
But are there certain companies
that have just raised too much capital
and is going to create, imbalances
in the ecosystem? Yes.
All right.
But we only have 45 seconds.
My issue is a lot of things
still don't work.
And I, I tried to ask. ChatGPT.
Yesterday how many full school weeks
there are in New York City public schools?
And it's like, oh,
I'd have to count it by hand and do it.
Seriously said
that it puts a screenshot of it.
A lot of these agent things,
like they don't work very well.
Like much like a lot of things
I want to ask,
who are the most common
guests on our blogs over the years?
It just gave me a bunch.
This was like, this is not your site, but
I'm just saying, like a lot of AI agents
and so forth,
they sort of crap out halfway through.
Yeah, I'm tempted
to do a live check of other products
that will give you a good
answer on that. But, the,
This goes back to what I was saying
about emergent capabilities,
the fail case, and this comes up actually
in many enterprise conversations,
is just because you tried something
two months ago.
Yeah. It doesn't mean it didn't work.
It doesn't mean it's not working today.
And so we all need to keep this open mind
that these technologies
are getting smarter
and better, at a rapid clip.
And, you know,
those are solvable problems.
All right, Dmitry
thank you so much for that.
Thank you.
Thanks, everyone. Thank you so much.
