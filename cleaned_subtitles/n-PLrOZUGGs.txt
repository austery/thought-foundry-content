many Anti-Trust cases against the most powerful companies in the world including Apple Microsoft alphabet Amazon meta and I'm sure Mara that all cosos in the world get proper nerves when your name shows up in their inbox but big welcome uh to this podcast well thank you very much and and of course I hope that they completely keep their calm because they like competition and they know that they're on the right side of competition law there we go now you have a very long title what is your mandate well basically as you say uh I enforce European competition law uh but also I have sort of a coordinating responsibility for Europe making the best use of digital technology so making sure that technology serves people and uh and the tool to make that happen is of course that you can trust technology what is the aim of Regulation well I think that if you look at how Europe approaches uh new technology we are tend to be more risk averse than in other parts uh of on other parts of of our planet and and for instance our AI regulation the point of that is to make sure that we can trust uh when AI is being used in situation where it may be critical if a municipality is using AI to decide who can get a social benefit then you really need to make sure that there is a human in the loop and that you can trust the AI to get it right and this is not Theory because we've had the first Scandal if you look at the piece of legislation like the Digital Services act it obliges uh service providers uh to make sure that their services are safe that for instance uh Instagram cannot provoke uh mental illnesses uh that uh Tik Tok or Twitter cannot X cannot be used to undermine our democracy and the D markets Act is there to make sure that the market is open and contestable so that it is worthwhile to invest also in start up and scale up because you know that it depends on their idea their work ethic their Capital their product it doesn't depend on some gatekeeper opening the gate to the market or not so with these three examples I try to show that uh regulation is a way to keep the market healthy and to make sure that uh technology actually is here to serve us and in doing so also making sure that there is plenty of room for Innovation so we'll um come back to the digital side of things which is of course very very important and topical but just uh generally how do you balance uh competition within Europe uh versus Europe being competitive globally uh it's very important that you sort of uh exercise your uh competitive muscle in your home Market which is why the single Market of the European Union should work uh well and in some instances better than today in order to be able actually to win the competition outside uh of the European Union on the global market we just uh Revisited uh a merger that we prohibited five six years ago which was the merger between two uh companies seamons and alom and it was prohibited on grounds of signaling systems and very high speed trains uh because the companies couldn't find ways to solve the competition problems they would have very very high market shares in Europe and there was a lot of talk about this uh that the Chinese would overtake uh the global market we've res Revisited uh the market now and it turns out that the Chinese are very big in China but not in many in any other markets of significance two companies in particular have filled order books uh and are playing uh really well and those two companies actually are seens and elom uh in the global Marketplace have you prohibited merges which you should not have prohibited I don't think so because it's something that we do really rarely and we do it with uh a lot of restraint we we go to the outmost efforts uh to make sure that businesses can solve the competition concerns uh that we may have because it's not for us to decide whether businesses should merge or not it's for us to make sure that if they merge uh follow on competition problems should be solved so only in a situation where the businesses either don't want to or do or cannot solve competition problems would we take a step to a Prohibition and which of the ones you which you have let through should you have stopped well that is difficult to say uh we try to revisit uh what we uh if the solutions to competition problems if they actually work and uh and that's a very difficult discipline because it may be that we say we need to have a fix it first we need to know to whom you want to divest this business where you have an overlap in a market where you would have a maybe a defao monopoly then we look at the buyers of this divested business and it may all look fine also financially but then maybe two years down the road three four years down the road problems arise markets changes and then it turns out that the buyer cannot make it that of course is really painful uh because customers will suffer from this uh workers will suffer from this but it's also very very difficult uh to predict whether a buyer years down the road will still have the financial capacity we prefer a a buyer which is in the market so that you have the necessary knowledge about the market for instance if it's in chemicals uh it's we prefer someone who's also in chemicals uh to buy a divested business rather than a a venture fund uh or or something like that in order for someone actually to go into that market use the asset be a competitive force uh in that market do you think um where we are now that there is a bigger risk for underregulation or overregulation I think the risk is that uh regulation sometimes is made uh quite fast and that is not implemented in full so it's better to have a thorough thoughtful legislative process and Implement Ino than rushing to something because you think you have a need here and now uh even if you think that you have a need here and now the key for good legislation is that it's fully implemented and that you have resources to fully implement it when I talk about thoughtful regulation it is regulation where you have time to take views on board views of of Industry views of ngos views of uh of those who who take an interest other Regulators because then you will have a much higher probability of making a piece of legislation where you're solving a legitimate proven problem in in the lightest possible manner uh because we have I think quite a heavy uh regul bureaucratic burden uh on some sectors where where businesses find that well of course fine sure we'll do this but couldn't that have been done in a in a lighter manner but do you um do you coordinate uh your work with um with the industrial policy do you ever sit down and think you know what we need a bigger champion in in this industry or that industry in order to compete with America China and so on I think the best example of of a pro competitive merger is the the creation of of Airbus it goes back many years by now had that not happened uh there would only have been one producer widebody uh airplanes and I think that's a very good example where you have a market situation that is really unbalanced and where you can do something by combining businesses then then become able to scale I would hope that the next commission would have uh a thorough look at the defense industry since uh defense budgets are increasing and we spent most of that today outside of Europe there is indeed room for consolidation of a European Defense industry in order to be more competitive towards competitors outside of Europe I think that's that's an obvious example uh a third uh approach to that would be to look at the the single Market to make it work in full we still have markets where uh their National characteristics are much more obvious than than in European Dimension we really miss a European Capital Market we really miss a European Telco market and that of course makes consolidation more tricky because then it's more difficult to harvest deficiencies in in what would be crossborder mergers where a true European single Market uh would be a much better sort of fertile ground uh to to exercise your competitive uh muscle and uh and be better to scale also outside of Europe you say we lack a European Telo Market but isn't that because of you no in America we have uh three operators in Europe we have three in each country right so we have a total of 30 they're all tiny well uh and not doing that well no it's not because of me um it's because of Market structure uh I think the four biggest uh operators in Europe they they organize about 60% of all customers so it's it's not that we have uh a a situation that is that much difficult different from from the US the difference is that for the businesses who are in more than one country they are still having to look at National characteristics we do not even have a European prefix there are differences in regulation there are differences in how things are done by national regulator so what we need is a is is a true European market for Telco and then I think we would uh have bigger Telco businesses because then would they would grow also organically uh within that market moving a bit um and spending um some time on technology which of course is uh extremely topical now um Sam ultman of open Ai and Dario amod of entropic say that they they don't fully understand how the advanced AI models work now how can you guys understand it but we don't try because it's uh I think it's uh overly ambitious uh to try to regulate technology uh what we occupy ourselves with is to look at the use of Technology because it's in the use cases that you see that hum may be squeezed discriminated uh not seen as who they are uh so if the algorithm uh the AI algorithm is Generation 1 2 3 4 well that may be for the developers to figure out how to work with transparency and explainability for for instance a a um a health um uh system in in a member state to use artificial intelligence as a supportive uh technology to the doctors making decisions about diagnosis and treatment is it's really important for them to know that when they use that the algorithm will actually recognize syst symptoms both in a man and in a woman so we are looking at that use case and sort of uh making sure that those who are responsible for the use case know what they are doing and for that then to filter back to Developers so say okay I would I would want to have my share of the European health market so I should make sure that my AI uh algorithm uh would have the features that you can safely put that into use without risking uh in this example half of the population because you do not uh recognize the symptoms in a woman uh of a heart attack for instance what are the complexities in the European digital markets act which you haven't seen before it just seems like like it's taken complexity to a new level here I think that one of the things that are uh difficult also for the businesses in scope is the the very sort of politicized debate around the digal services act so the D services act do not regulate content there's no European legislation saying you can say this but not that it all uh relates with national legislation on content in most countries hate speech is forbidden it's forbidden to excite to violence it's forbidden to recruit to terrorism uh is forbidden to to of course abuse children but also to to exchange uh photographs of uh of children that are being abused what the D services Act is doing at the European level is to say you need to have a system so that you can filter out things that are illegal in the member states where you do your business and in that system you also need to tell people your content has been filtered out so that they can complain about it that's the first obligation the second obligation is to do a horizontal risk assessment to say could my services be damaging for instance to mental health because they have an addictive design uh we just had a a a case with um Tik Tok uh who wanted to launch a new product that would give you points when you're interacted with content so if you like the video if you saw it all to the end if you shared it if you comment it you would get points and you could use those points for e-commerce so you basically get a voucher and um and we could not get any kind of certainty that they had assess whether this design who might be extremely addictive whether that was the case and if they had mitigated those risks and it ended up that they would not launch this product uh in Europe because they could not certify that they had actually done their homework to make sure that this was a safe product to use how is it to work with these big tech companies well it depends on the I mean how how forthcoming are they and how willing are they to engage in a conversation with you when you when you call they're very different they have very different cultures uh the first time I I was ever in in Silicon Valley in Pao Alto was was quite recently I went because I had a speaking obligation and um and then I visited Apple and Google and uh and apple they live in this uh building gated uh building of Steel and and sort of pale light marble a perfect um is not a circle it's an oval I think Google uh they live of course they have security but ungated in a very Co colorful sort of uh low barrier uh environment uh that seems to have grown as the business has grown and and you know just by by how they present themselves in their architecture I think tells a lot about the company culture so who is the most difficult to work with well they have their own difficulties uh and of course their own uh charms as well uh as as you can hear uh the building uh of the Apple headquarter also reflects that you are a a wall Garden from the the gadget the phone itself to the operating system uh to to the different apps where the Google environment is much more open you know there's no it's not a Google phone it may be a Samsung phone with an an Android operating system so so you see that those differences uh in also how they approach uh Regulators should the big uh tech companies be broken up well uh I think that would be a a measure of of last resource thought uh anything you can do before you get to that to solve a problem should be done uh right now we have a Google case con concerning uh advertising the very short uh non-technical version is that Google owns the marketplace where those who buy uh ads and those who sells uh ads um uh placing uh they meet but they also own the ones who buys um placing and the ones who sells at placing so if you own the buyer the seller and the marketplace well then you have a conflict of interest and and here you know when we sent the the statement of objection we said we have huge difficulties in seeing how that conflict of interest can be solved without uh part of this uh being governed by a third party so a breakup of this specific part of uh of the Google ecosystem uh of course we're all ears if it can be done uh differently because as said we have the competence to ask for a breakup of a company but it would be a meure of L Resort do you um coordinate your work with um the US chair of the Federal Trade Commission on specific cases when we have the waivers from companies so that we can talk uh we do yes uh and uh and we also have sort of a more highlevel discussion about uh how things are developing it's like a sipling to what was created in this mandate the trade and Technology Council uh I had it with my colleague v d Broski on our side on the US side is Blink and rimond and Tai who who headset this trade technology C has a sipling which is a sort of a structured dialogue uh between the FDC the doj and us uh it takes place once a year and and we discuss development in technology in in markets uh in how we use our our tools and a specific spefic example would be the the very recent sort of common communication between the FTC the doj US and actually also the CMA of the UK about how we will work together and approach the question of how AI will affect uh the marketplace uh because we saw how market dynamics they accelerated with sort of the first big chapter of digitization and and our Theory or or idea is that that acceleration of Market development may actually increase uh with AI when it gets more and more embedded uh in businesses and in the business models so when the companies say that uh hey uh there is too much regulation in Europe and it's too complicated we're not going to launch more products uh you will have less availability and so on is that a is that a credible threat I think it's a it's a really important discussion because it it points to the fact that we need to do more to increase European competitiveness as such and here you know uh competition is a necessary ingredients but it's not enough and it's it's a tricky thing because we have shown to solve crisises that are questions of life and death in our face really fastpaced crisises pandemic War uh energy crisis uh inflation Europe has come together now the crisis of uh com U competitiv is a slow one competitiveness being eroded over years it will take time to to rebuild because it's a question of Market access safe Supply chains um easy permitting um uh authorities who are um fast in in what they do uh access to research and Innovation uh organizations um and of course uh better access to Capital but M do you do you improve competitiveness by regulating more uh no I don't think so but sometimes uh for instance if you look at at biotech uh Europe Prides itself in having some very important biotech environments in Denmark in in Belgium in in France um Cutting Edge front end it's a uh factor of competitiveness the time from Innovation uh to Market and in order to speed that up uh I think it's necessary to do a biotech act uh in this coming mandate because sometimes biotech sort of falls into sort of an old school thinking about how to regulate a chemical a novel chemical that needs to get to Market and biotech is is specific it has its specific uh characteristics uh it works very differently from from a sort of a more old school chemical so here you know the regulation comes into place actually to make it faster and easier year to get to Market not to make more barriers but the regulation is needed because otherwise you would be caught up in in other pieces of legislation that would then make things more difficult but um so some um uh American investors such as Mark andron and so on have said that listen we need to build we need to stuff AI into everything we do in order to beat the Chinese right we need to stuff it into weapons cars uh you know farma research all these kind of things so by by regulating AI a lot are we are we holding back uh the European competitiveness versus America and China well uh the the regulation that we have do not regulate uh research uh in AI or based on AI at all it's hands off full stop there's no regulation um it doesn't say that you cannot do this you cannot do that what it says is that if you're in a situation where uh there is a risk of people being discriminated then you have to take certain measures so basically you can do so so so many things it is when it comes to the use cases so the market creation that the AI regulation really touches you and and looking at Europe if you say Okay I want to prove my algorithm in my home Market uh before I I really uh can can go in for in in the Global Market then for instance the European welfare states is an obvious place for a market creation for trustworthy AI that you can use AI in in Health Systems in Social systems in Educational Systems because you can trust it you can also say well listen look at us we can do this people trust what we do with AI that will be a market creating um approach to the use of AI that I think will will be reflected in also a very strong selling point uh outside of Europe because who wants to use an AI where there is a risk of your citizens being discriminated well for sure some big uh big questions in the tech sector here uh let's move on to something slightly easier banking sector now one of the trade-offs between having a competitive internal Market with many banks in one country or building up a bit more kind of global Champions well I think it's very important to have uh both uh there are different uh customer uh preferences um it would be much better for Europe if we had one European Capital Market uh it would also make it much easier for banks to to consolidate uh where we now think about that uh cross border because then it would be easier to harest uh efficiencies uh uh and making sure that it would be actually beneficial for you uh to be in more countries so I think the the push still for for the Capital Market to work and it's very much a push towards member states uh to take down in full that's a European um uh legislation European enforcement should take the place of national legislation and National enforcement because then you get a full working single Market uh also for for Bank because for for big business uh for some of the huge conglomerates in order for them to be relevant to work with a European Bank of course you need size uh you need to be able to scale you need to be able to get uh Global Services so uh I really hope that we can do this push um uh the there is a test inspired by enri Keta in his report on the single Market to sort of push for a a fully working Capital Market by by looking at savings and Investments uh I think both approaches are are good uh the important thing is of course that we continue taking down the barriers uh that disable a fully functioning uh single Market uh also when it comes to banking services because that would be that would give uh greater scaling opportunities but is it a matter of having a single uh kind of Capital Market because in banking it seems like one Bank needs to go bankrupt before it can be taken over by somebody else right like we saw in Switzerland credit s bank basically went bur before UBS can could buy it so the biggest European bank now is I think number 20 worldwide you know we basically don't have any Champions we've not assessed uh Bank mergers uh that I can remember uh what we have seen is the the recovery uh of a banking sector which was very heavily hit uh by the financial CR uh I think to some degree uh challenged by digitization and getting their customers used uh to do uh all their banking uh digitally uh and I think that may be one of the factors uh holding back that it has taken longer in Europe to uh recover from the financial crisis uh than for instance uh in the US after the Ukrainian situation we um had uh a guess Supply issue in in Europe with uh with gas prom um how do you assess why we ended up in a situation like that which was so concentrated on the supply side because it was cheap uh we wanted that cheap energy uh because for for obvious reasons that works very well uh as an input uh to your industry and uh I think we didn't realize that there was the price to pay uh to get cheap energy and the price that we paid was uh our security and our the security of our neighbors um so I think that it was a unfortunate um but seemingly necessary wakeup call that we need to assess the full price uh of our uh supplies uh to have you know an open transparent assessment that if we want things cheap if there is a security premium uh to be paid now we have uh Diversified uh the gas supply both pipeline gas and LG and the LG infrastructure has been built up uh very very fast so we have I think 10 12 uh Prime uh suppliers to rely on and that's a much more healthy structure uh than what we had before that has happened within few years uh because obviously gas is a is a crucial energy energy input uh and will remain so for a number of years it's lower in in carbon than uh than than oil and and coal uh so it's a good transition uh fuel for for a number of reasons and I think it's a very good example of of the fact that when faced with an urgent crisis Europe can move fast uh as it has been done in this situation is there a chance that we could end up in a similar situation with uh with batteries or solar panels given that we are now so dependent on China that is a that's a huge risk uh I do hope that we will uh learn from uh from what we see as the Chinese Playbook on on how the solar panel industry was de facto moved to China uh within a relatively short time frame starting with joint ventures uh in in in China joint ventures taking over by China the Chinese market closing uh the Chinese market working as a as a building ground uh for a solar panel industry now with a huge uh production at very low cost making it very difficult if not impossible for European producers to be uh competitive and uh we should make sure that this does not happen uh if you look for instance at our wind industry very important uh European uh wind uh producers who are faced with Fierce competition by the Chinese uh um using more or less uh the same Playbook but luckily not so advanced yet so I think that will be a very important uh area of concern uh you might know that we have something called the foreign subsidies regulation so uh we can look for instance at uh tendering if we fear that there has been Foul Play so it's not a competitive tender but it's a tender based on subsidies from third countries then we can investigate and we're doing that right now uh and I think that might be an effective way of making sure that uh unfair competition do not uh take a hold it's been a massive change in the geopolitical situation since you took over this job how um how has it changed the way you have to think um if you I should give one example we we made in the last year of the Yonka commission so six years ago a a China strategy uh with three different elements so partnership on uh fighting climate change uh competition on economic matters rivalry uh when it comes to uh the governing system we are democracy we do not consider them a democracy what we have seen over the last year is that two of the legs have grown very much together uh economic competition and systemic rivalry which has made us be much more focusing on economic security which is sort of the answer to the fact that systemic rival an economic competition uh becomes two sides of the same coin and for Economic Security uh it is it's a very U broad effort it's about export controls but it's also about our research and Innovation organizations do they do the due diligence uh to know if students uh PhD students if they are who they say they are and if they come here for the right reasons or if they de facto comes here to do what you could call sort of industrial espion or research uh Espionage so it's um it's a far-reaching effort uh especially in uh in a number of uh of critical uh Technologies uh you know AI uh semiconductors um uh biotech uh a number of uh of of sectors uh actually and that is I think a very prudent answer to the fact that uh the geopolitics have become much more hostile than what they were 10 years ago do you mind if I ask you a personal question because you are standing in the middle of these massive decisions with the most powerful companies in the world uh trying to uh convince you in all different types of directions how does it feel to to be the the head of this well I I think it would be very lonely if it wasn't for for the amazing people that I work with and it it would it will feel maybe also a bit in vain if I didn't look at the people that we serve um sometimes you know I'm I'm in a meeting and and the person on the other side of the table makes I don't know how many times more uh than I would ever do uh and his business may have a turnover uh that is U the same as a smaller European member State and you know mentally sometimes I'm giving this advice that you should people you should picture people naked I I never do that because maybe you cannot unsee that that mental image and I think that's unhealthy I'm glad you're not trying that on me so so instead what I picture is that I have the 450 million Europeans having my back uh you know we have this discussion about crowd sizes and and you know that is my crowd size that that is what I'm thinking about uh when I'm in such a meeting uh and then for me mentally that that is balancing uh things out but yeah you have a crowd size but I mean you still have the biggest companies in the world trying to Lobby you uh you know uh you have uh the big Nations you have uh the big geopolitical powers and so on um what what is the toughest thing you have experienced well I think when I have uh when I find that things are tough is if there is a lack of respect of the legitimacy of the laws that we have we have a well functioning democracy we have well-functioning ways of of drafting legislation discussing legislation passing legislation when I find that when I I question our world order is if a business maybe gigantic maybe smaller says yeah but don't care about your rules because if if businesses with this kind of power goes Rogue then we have a problem I haven't seen that in full uh but sometimes I see a tendency uh of that and and that of course is uh is extremely worrying uh for our democracy how do you relax what's uh key to you having a bit of a higger um I will I will uh run I try to do that every second day I'm not always successful but I try to that and I'm a very eager Knitter uh and I find that you know a lot of the work that I do is is based on words I listen a lot uh I talk a lot I read a lot uh so you know producing something with my hands and the feeling of of yarn of wool silk alpaka you know that is a I think a very soothing uh grounding thing for for me to do it's a it's a Pity that you cannot wear more than one sweater at a time because I'm I'm quite productive what do you read I read uh um novels uh it's really rare that I lead read sort of leadership um uh literature uh because since since leadership is about people I find that a a novel is a is a way to learn about people that I would never ever meet that I would not have a chance to get close to I would not be able to get under their skin so I find that is uh that is really important for me uh I just read a book which is I'm in the process of reading a book of um a Finnish writer called kvest it is a skur so it's a dusk 41 I don't actually know what is the the English title um so it takes place under the Second World War uh it's a man and a woman's perspective they take turns uh and they are in a relationship and it's very telling uh both of the historical situation of the The Finnish uh geography when it comes to Wars they have had so many they've been so tough on them and uh and how people respond to war so even though it takes place during the second world war it's uh uh it's a very uh moving touching insightful um recollection of how people react to War uh also those who not directly a soldier or or faced with it so I would I would highly highly recommend it I will um I will order it straight away um now what um what advice do you have to young people I think I think they are in a in a difficult situation um because they have I think as we all have had the the uncertainty am I good enough uh how do I look uh do they see my weaknesses uh do I have a social network um all that has been accelerated and I think uh on on speed because of uh uh quite a number of things uh and unfortunately I don't think that we're done dealing with the pandemic yet I think for young people it has taken a hold that adults have we have moved on but I think it taken a hold in in many young people so I I think the most important thing is to say You're Not Alone we adults we're here for you you have friends you have there are other young people who are in the same situation don't think that you're alone we we want to listen to you we want to help you we rely on you for our society to change and even if you feel alone and you have anxieties and you have challenges um Society needs you I think that is an important message to to any Young Generation wonderful that's um a very nice place to to end it's been uh fantastic talking to you uh big thanks for all your important work and uh all the best going forward well thank you very much and thank you for the podcast I I enjoyed very much uh myself so um I think that's also part of the transparency of how people think uh in walks of life so thank you very much
