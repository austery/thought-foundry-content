in this video I'll teach you a system
for remembering everything you read
study or learn I've been using the
system for the last 7 years starting
from learning disease pathophysiology in
medical school through to reading
research articles and learning science
or reading books on productivity or
business and the reason the system works
so consistently and so well is because
it breaks down that process of reading
into two distinct stages the first stage
is the consumption
period and the second stage is the
digestion
period most people think that by
focusing on the first stage and
consuming more information they'll be
able to therefore remember and apply
more information so they focus on trying
to read faster or watching lectures at
triple speed or binge listening to audio
books or watching hours of YouTube
tutorials but that is not how learning
works and once we understand how
learning does work you'll see why my
system is so effective you see when it
comes to remembering and applying
information it's much less about what
comes in to your brain and it's much
more about how much stays in your brain
and that is what the second stage the
digestion period is all about and it's
the part that is often neglected so
teach you a system for mastering both of
these stages which in turn increases
your Aurora retention as well as your
ability to actually use the knowledge in
the way that you need to but first we
need to ask ourselves is it even
possible to remember everything you read
and the short answer is no but here's
the secret trying to remember everything
we read should not be the goal in the
first place and we know this because of
a man who actually could remember
everything this man's name is Kim Peak
and his story is so crazy that Hollywood
made an entire movie about him Kim Peak
was a mega genius and his memory was
ridiculous he was able to memorize a
book with such perfect recall that after
reading a book one time he would be able
to write it out word for word with every
comma and full stop back to front he
memorized so many maps and atlases that
he could give you driving directions
between any two cities in the world and
the path that he gave you was mentally
calculated to be the shortest distance
now the reason K had such supernatural
abilities is because of a very rare
medical condition he had called FG
syndrome he was born with macroy which
means he had a larger brain and he had
no Corpus colossum which is basically
the bundle of neurons that connect both
hemispheres of the brain together in
scientists believe that because he
didn't have the normal pattern of
neurons his brain adapted and developed
Ved new connections to compensate which
I guess gave him like superhuman memory
now I want you to imagine that both you
and Kim Peak were about to sit the same
exam who do you think would do better
and the answer is that it actually
depends on the exam you see despite his
superhuman memory Kim Peak struggled
with reasoning and problem solving which
means that if the exam was at the junior
levels of schooling which often tests on
the lower levels of of learning which
involve a lot of memorization and recall
then Kim Peak would definitely win but
if the exam was at a higher level like
University or postgraduate where the
reasoning and problem solving the higher
orders of learning are examined as a
higher priority then you may actually
have the edge now for most of you
listening probably using the knowledge
you have consumed to reason and problem
solve is kind of the whole point of why
you're trying to read and remember in
the first place which basically means
that it is not enough to remember
everything which is good because for
most people that's not possible anyway
but it is possible to remember
everything you need to remember in such
a way that we can use that knowledge in
the way we need to and that is what the
system that I'll teach you helps you to
achieve so to start using the system we
have to understand that not all
information is equal in fact I break
down the information that I read into
five different categories using the
acronym
Pacer and it's important to be able to
identify which category the information
you're reading to belongs to because for
each category there are specific
targeted processes that then help you to
deal with and manage that information
more effectively and when we use the
wrong process for the specific category
of information it makes remembering and
understanding what you read much harder
much more timec consuming and much less
effective and that you're more likely to
forget what you read it also increases
the chance of you entering the passive
mode of reading which is where you get
to the bottom of a page and you can't
even remember what you just read so the
system goes like this in the first part
where we are consuming information we
want to identify which category what we
are consuming belongs to using the Pacer
acronym then during stage two we digest
what we have read using the targeted
process for that category which takes
the information and stores it in our
long-term memory through the process
called encoding so let's go through
Pacer together so that you can
accurately identify the category of
information you're trying to remember
the p and Pacer stands for
procedural and procedural information is
any information that tells you how
something should be executed for example
this is a book that I used during
medical school that taught me about how
to do a clinical examination like listen
to a heartbeat or take someone's blood
pressure and a lot of the information in
this book is about the correct technique
to perform the examination and some
subjects and domains have a lot of
procedural information some great
examples of this would be coding and
languages the targeted process for
working with with and mastering this
type of procedural information is
practice the key is that you want to
apply procedural information in real
life as early as possible a lot of
people will spend time to read it and
memorize it and write lots of notes
about it and then a week or two later
they'll try to practice it but by then
it's too late we've already forgotten a
lot of it and a lot of that time is just
wasted instead as soon as you take that
procedural information into your brain
try to apply it and practice it as early
as you can now straight away we run into
a problem with using this approach what
if we're reading something and we don't
have time to practice it right now the
answer is you either move on to
something else or you stop consuming
anything and you wait until you have
time to practice it but you do not waste
your time trying to just memor memorize
it on the spot because here is the
crucial part about learning that
everyone overlooks the two stages of
consuming and digesting must always be
balanced everything you consume must be
digested in order for you to retain and
use it only when stage one is followed
by stage two does learning actually
occur if we're reading something and we
don't have time time to use the right
process like practice then most people
will say oh well I don't have time right
now I'm just going to get through as
much of it as I can and they spend more
time reading and reading and essentially
just consuming more and more but this is
the learning equivalent of overeating
they haven't had a chance to digest it
so they're just going to end up vomiting
it all up again through the mental
vomiting process we call forgetting
which is why for most people the amount
that they forget after reading is
extremely high with some studies
suggesting that up to
90% of what is consumed is forgotten
despite hours of consuming and if we're
forgetting 90% of what we read rather
than consuming more and taking time away
from the digesting it actually makes
more sense to spend less time consuming
and more time on the digesting and
processing this increases your retention
with which therefore increases the
amount of working knowledge you're able
to build so earlier I said what goes
into your brain is less important than
what stays in your brain and this
principle of balancing stage one
consuming with stage two digesting is
important not just for procedural
information but for every other category
of PESA unfortunately stage two
digesting is almost completely neglected
for the second category of in the a of
Pacer which stands for
analogous analogous information is
actually one of the easiest types of
information to work with and remember
and apply because analogous information
is the information that is related to
something you already have prior
knowledge about and even if we don't
have direct prior knowledge about it it
may remind us indirectly of something
that we do have knowledge about for
example let's say that we are an avid
swimmer and we're learning about the
physiology of a muscle contraction when
we look at that muscle contraction cycle
we might think hey that reminds me a lot
about the swimming technique I use and
by connecting the new information about
muscle contraction physiology with what
we already know our swimming technique
we have created
an analogy and so that is analogous
information and analogies can form with
any prior knowledge including knowledge
within a topic itself in most fields of
study there are Concepts or patterns of
Concepts and relationships that tend to
repeat and recur throughout that field
you might have learned about how to
solve a particular type of problem last
semester and now this semester this new
problem solving approach that you're
learning for the first time reminds you
a lot of that old problem solving
process and relating those two
approaches is also an analogy so when
we're engaging in stage one the
consumption period of reading we want to
actively be thinking about whether what
we are reading is related to something
that we already have knowledge about and
once we identify it as potentially
analogous information the targeted
process we want to use here is critique
this is the part I said everyone misses
once we create an analogy critiquing it
means we examine critically how good
that analogy actually is for example
with the analogy of muscle contraction
and swimming technique critiquing that
analogy means asking ourselves in what
way specifically are these two things
similar or related to each other in what
ways are they different in what
situation does this analogy not make
sense anymore and if there are a lot of
differences or a lot of conditions and
situations where the analogy breaks
apart then is there a better analogy or
can we extend or modify that analogy to
make it more comprehensive and more
accurate this critiquing process
massively drives up our attention and
depth of understanding of this new
information and the reason this works is
because instead of new information just
being new information that your brain
doesn't know what to do with we're
actually extending it from what we
already know we're taking our existing
Network and connecting it to the new
information straight away which is the
reason why creating analogies has been
shown in studies repeatedly to be so
powerful for our retention and
understanding now at this point you
might be looking at the system and
thinking this seems a little forced it
doesn't feel natural and you're right in
fact it's crucial that you understand
that this is not natural and that's why
it works if you have no time pressure
and it doesn't matter how well you learn
something then you can learn and read
however you want but unfortunately what
research has shown is that there are
clear biological limitations of the
human brain to how much it can consume
and store into our memory in one go and
in the modern day when there is so much
we have to learn it is very very easy to
exceed that biological limit and then
get overwhelmed learning is extremely
complicated so to be able to learn a lot
in a short amount of time reach a high
level of knowledge a lot of processes
need to go right and this is why most
people will Plateau on their learning
ability and after a point not really
improve for the rest of their lives for
me figuring out what processes to care
about and therefore what to improve on
and then how to even execute on those
correctly took me at least 7 or 8 years
of almost constant experimentation and
reading of research and coaching people
to see what works for them and honestly
I got lucky because 10 15 years ago a
lot of the research didn't even exists
which is why to make it easier for you
I've started a free Weekly Newsletter I
take everything that I've learned that
helps you become a more efficient
learner the things that have the highest
chance of giving you success in a short
amount of time and I packaged them in a
way that you can take and Implement into
your own learning in less than 10 15
minutes if you want to sign up to the
newsletter it's completely free I'll
leave a link in the description for you
now getting back to peser you might
notice that the way that I've written
the a in PESA is is like this it's this
kind of strange shape there the reason
is because a the analogous information
can exist within as a subset of
procedural information for example you
could create an analogy on a set of
instructions to make it simpler and
easier for you to understand and then
later you go and practice it but
analogous information also exists as a
subset within the next category of
information which is the C of Paca and
this stands for
conceptual if procedural information is
the how to do something then conceptual
information is the what and for most
science subjects the majority of what
you need to learn is conceptual
conceptual information includes facts
and explanations theories and principles
relationships between Concepts and ways
that that concept can be applied and in
most cases we need both the procedural
and the conceptual knowledge to solve a
problem and apply our knowledge properly
for example although this book goes
through how to listen to someone's heart
I still need to have the conceptual
knowledge about what I'm listening to to
be able to analyze that and make a
conclusion on the diagnosis so when we
identify that a piece of text we're
reading is conceptual type information
the process we want to use straight away
is
mapping
nonlinear network based note taking such
as mind mapping is an efficient way of
increasing your attention and Mastery of
conceptual knowledge because conceptual
knowledge inherently exists in a network
although a textbook or a lecture might
be delivered word after word in a linear
format if we look at the mind and
knowledge of the person that wrote that
textbook it doesn't exist in a linear
sentence by sentence structure their
knowledge and expertise exists in a
highly connected network of information
there is no innate sequence of
information an expert can start at any
point and navigate to any other point
this is what allows an expert to do
complex problem solving because they can
look at a problem understand what
concepts are related and see how those
Concepts connect together to solve the
problem whereas a beginner who's only
learned it at a surface level just sees
individual separated Concepts and they
don't understand how they link together
as a learner our job is not to remember
the sequence word for word our job is to
try to recreate that network of
knowledge that the expert had and
mapping is such a great technique
because it forces us to not only think
about each fact and concept but also how
they connect to each other to form a
bigger picture so when you are reading
and consuming take some time to get out
a piece of paper or a tablet and make a
map of the things that you're learning
and as you read more you add more to
your map you move things around you
reorganize things as you read more you
also digest more and your map grows
remember analogous information can also
exist within conceptual information so
you might find Opportunities within
conceptual information to create some
analogies and you might want to add
those into your map as well even if the
analogy doesn't make its way into the
map it could give you an idea in terms
of how you want to structure your ideas
on your map now here's that same problem
again let's say you reading but you
don't have time to draw a map or maybe
you don't have anything to map on while
you're reading then again we need to
slow down and consume less so that
consumption and digestion can stay
balanced and if you don't you'll just
end up overwhelmed again and wasting
time because not only are you going to
forget a lot of what you are consuming
but now you've given the future version
of you more work to do by having to go
and figure out what your forgotten and
then Rec consume it again anyway now the
good news is that the digesting of
procedural analogous and conceptual
information is easily the most timec
consuming the E and the r of PESA are
much faster and easier to deal with I
talk about e and are together because
they're both very similar to each other
but pay close attention because the two
are actually so similar to each other
that most people never distinguish
between the two and that can lead
directly to hours of wasted time per
week the E and Pacer stands for
evidence evidence type information is
the information that helps make
conceptual information more concrete
they're often very detailed sometimes
very technical pieces of information but
they're useful because we can use these
facts or statistics or cases as examples
to prove a conceptual point for example
we could understand
conceptually how World War I started but
we also need to know the evidence
information of date certain specific
events occurred between which specific
people at which specific location to
make that concept more concrete and the
key process for evidence type
information is to
store and
rehearse store means that you just colle
collect that information and note it
down somewhere you could add it to your
conceptual map you could add it to a
second brain system using something like
notion or Rome or obsidian or you can
put it onto flashcards you could even
just write them down on a document
somewhere with all the other things that
you are storing this should happen as
soon as you identify it so as you are
consuming the information and you
identify that this piece of information
is an Evidence type we go ahead and
straight away store it the rehearsing
part of it comes a little later we put
aside time to do the rehearsal and
rehearsing the information is the key to
improving our retention of evidence type
information rehearsing means that we
think about how we will need to use this
piece of information how are we going to
apply it what type of conceptual
information is this an example of we
then challenge ourselves by using an
applying that information in the way
that we will need to use it this means
solving problems or writing detailed
answers to questions or creating
explanations teaching it to other people
or maybe writing essays that use that
piece of evidence as a supporting
example for a wider concept and so while
we store the information while we
consume it the rehearsing happens later
maybe at the end of the day or at the
end of the week but do not waste time
while you are cons assuming trying to
just memorize and read and reread and
writing copious notes on that piece of
information otherwise you are not going
to have enough time for the PA and C the
first three types of information which
is what forms the foundation of
knowledge that the evidence type needs
to build off of in the first place now
evidence type information is very
similar to the final type which is the r
of PESA and this stands for
reference type information reference
information is the easiest to deal with
it is all of the Nitty Gritty very
specific detailed bits of information
that don't really change your conceptual
understanding they're not particularly
that important they're not analogous and
they're not procedural but for whatever
reason we might need to know this later
this might be something like the exact
value of a mathematical con Conant or a
specific Gene involved in a particular
mutation or the name of a very specific
molecule of a disease or maybe a list of
attributes used to define a variable for
coding and the process we use to deal
with this type of information is the
same as for evidence almost it's store
and rehearse the same
things the storing part exactly the same
you Chuck it in a second brand and your
flash cards wherever makes sense for you
but if you need to be able to record
this information from memory and you
can't like refer back to your notes when
you need to use it then you probably
want to use something like flash cards
because the rehearse part is a little
different because reference type
information is by definition not very
conceptually important anyway it's quite
hard to use this for problem solving or
as part of like an extended discussion
or answer the way we're probably going
to use this information is just Direct
fact recoil which is why something like
flash cards using a space repetition
active recoil strategy like an app like
ankey is going to be the best way to
handle reference type information so as
you're reading and you're thinking hey
this might be a reference type
information you dump it into your
flashcards and you put aside like 30
minutes every day or whatever to just go
through your flash cards to do your
rehearsal but please again
absolutely do not waste time while
you're reading trying to just read and
reread and write notes and just memorize
this information at the time you need to
use that time for the first three which
forms the bulk of your knowledge as I
said earlier there are a lot of things
that need to go right to be able to
learn a lot of information in a short
period of time and wasting time on
trying to memorize reference information
while you are reading it instead of
spending that time on the first three
types is one of the worst offenders and
as soon as you get into that mind frame
of reading something and then rereading
it again trying to get it into your head
you can say goodbye to your learning
efficiency so now you know the five
types of information for you to try to
identify as you consume in stage one and
the appropriate targeted process that
will help you to digest that information
in stage two and the key to be able to
retain a lot and have a good high level
of knowledge for what you have consumed
is to keep that stage one and stage two
balanced however when it comes to
learning efficiently this just scratches
the surface in fact if you look at this
map of learning that outlines the major
processes that you need to be a
consistently High performing efficient
learner what we talked about today is
like barely a few percent of it so if
you want to start unpacking what those
other processes look like without having
to dedicate
a decade of your life to uh learning
about it like I did then make sure to
