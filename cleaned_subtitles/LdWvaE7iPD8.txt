Let me immediately uh clarify things a
bit by telling you a little bit about
the difference of the University of
Chicago's writing program. We're one of,
as far as we know, two in the country
who takes what we call a top- down
approach to writing rather than bottom
up. Every other school in the country,
their primary constituency is freshmen.
Um so most every school has something
like freshman composition, freshman
writing, freshman seminars, etc. Um we
don't actually have that course here.
Um, as I remind people, Chicago is I
don't know if it's the only country,
only university in the country, but one
of the few that has more faculty than we
have freshmen. Um, that's because our
program teaches uh throughout the
medical school, and they don't usually
count those faculty when they're talking
about faculty ratios to students, but we
teach in the medical school all the
time, and they're chucka block with
faculty because most of their doctors
are are also faculty members. So when
this program got started in the late 70s
early 80s our task was not to help the
students it was to help the faculty. Um
this writing program got created because
the people on this campus as guy who
started it used to say you know our
freshman write pretty well
by the time they're third and fourth
year students they don't write as well.
Our graduate students struggle but the
people with the real writing problems
are the faculty which just turns on its
head the standard notion that writing is
a basic skill. The standard notion in
the US and around the world is writing
reading writing arithmetic you're
supposed to learn it in high school or
grammar school high school maybe a
little bit of college but if you have to
learn it after that there's something
wrong with you and therefore there's
something remedial about programs like
this. I've been talking to people for 30
years
who their main reaction to any program I
teach is that they do not want to be
there and they think there's something a
little bit, you know,
offensive. I teach a lot in London. Let
me tell you, you get a whole bunch of
Oxford and Cambridge educated
professionals or academics in a room and
say, "We've brought in this guy to help
you with your writing, and by the way,
he's from Chicago."
You know, waves of hostility coming at
me across the room. So, I need to I need
you to know that this is not a remedial
writing course. This is not a course in
anything that you should have learned
earlier on and didn't. It is
overwhelmingly not a course in rules. I
am not going to give you rules for
writing. In fact, I'm going to spend a
lot of a time attacking the fact that
your training has been rulegoverned
training. We think that is very bad for
people who are operating at the level
that you're operating. Rulego training
is very useful for people who are, and
forgive me for saying this, who are
turnurning out a lot of writing, each of
which is of relatively low value. So, if
you're working at a business where you
have to write a short memo every day or
two to convey some information to
somebody, it's fine to have a rule. It's
fine to say, "This is what it's going to
look like. Here's what your sentences
should look like. Get it out." But that
is not what you're doing. That is not
the level of value your work has to
generate. And so, you one of the things
that I'm going to be saying to you is
you need to stop thinking about rules
and start thinking about readers.
So here's the problem that experts have.
You are in our
our vocabulary, you are what we call
expert writers.
What this means is not that you are
necessarily expert at writing, although
you may be extremely good at writers.
But what it means is that you are
writing about a subject at which you
have expert knowledge. You are not like
high school students who are using their
writing to introduce themselves to some
something at a fairly basic level. You
are operating at the most sophisticated
levels. When I work with faculty on this
and other campus, I am working with
people who are after all on the
frontiers of knowledge. They're thinking
stuff nobody's thought before. This is
very hard stuff.
So
here's what you're doing.
You are thinking about your world in
very difficult ways.
This is a terrifically good thing and
it's the source of most of the value of
your work.
Now you are also writing about that
world and this is where it starts a
problem starts arising. Unlike a
journalist,
almost surely you are using your writing
process to help yourself think.
In other words, the thinking that you're
doing is at such a level of complexity
that you have to use writing to help
yourself do your thinking. This is quite
different from high school students. My
high school teachers told me, Larry,
there are two different processes.
First, there's a thinking process, then
there's a writing process. I had a
teacher who said to me, "You are not
ready to write your first word until you
are finished thinking." And she said to
me, "To prove this to you, I'm going to
have you, whenever you turn in a paper,
I'm going to have you turn in the
outline you use to do your thinking."
This was not a problem for me. First, I
wrote the paper, then I wrote the
outline.
But I thought I was the only one. I
thought everybody else when they did
this thinking just, you know, thought it
till they were done and then their essay
like Athena burst from their forehead
onto the page. I thought I was trying to
keep it secret that I didn't work that
way. Nobody works that way. It doesn't
mean you don't have outlines or good
idea. It doesn't mean you don't take
notes. It's a good idea. It doesn't mean
you don't have other ways of thinking.
But you are using your writing to help
yourself think.
If you don't do this for most people,
you cannot think at the level you need
to think. Quite different say from a
journalist who's sitting down writing.
The journalist is not using the writing
process to think up new ideas about the
world. You are
this means you have a very different set
of writing challenges than anybody else
has. This is a course about those
challenges. Our program is about those
challenges because here's the challenge.
You write this text, this grant
proposal, this article, this
dissertation proposal, this book. You
actually generate it on the horizontal
axis. You actually generate the text
while you are doing your thinking. But
then you're going to send this text out
to readers
and the readers are going to look
through that text and if you've done
your job, they're going to change the
way they see the world. So here's the
problem symbolically.
You actually generate a text on the
horizontal axis, but whether it does its
job depends on the vertical axis.
And here's the problem. Very
predictably,
experts
use language in one set of patterns to
do their thinking, but those very same
experts read with a different pattern.
So here's what happens. You have used
your text as you must use it to help
yourself think, but you're going to use
writing patterns and language patterns
that interfere with the way your readers
read when they read, even when those
readers are also other experts.
So, you are interfering with their
reading process when you're writing. I
promise you, you are.
What happens to readers when you do
that?
>> The last thing they're going to do is
they're just going to stop. What happens
before then? What leads up to that
stopping? You're absolutely right. They
stop. But let's talk a little bit about
what leads up to it. You're writing like
this. They're reading like this. What's
the first thing that happens to them?
>> This has never happened to you.
>> I can't hear.
>> Cannot interrupt it. Right.
>> Right. So they misunderstand. That's the
second thing that happens. The second
thing that happens is you interfere.
They do not understand.
What's the first thing that happens?
>> They're skipping stuff.
>> They're skipping stuff. I'm going to put
that in the bucket of stopping. They
just either either in little ways or big
ways, they stop, right? What was the
first thing that happened?
This has never happened to you. You've
never tried to read something which was
clearly not written in the way you're
trying to read it. I bet that in the
last week you've written you've read
stuff that was not written in the way
you are seeking to read it. What's the
first thing that happens to you?
>> It seems
>> that I'm going to put that in the
doesn't understand bucket. See what I
mean? I mean I'm being crude. Pardon me.
>> paragraphs. You need to reread
paragraphs. You're reading them over and
over and over.
>> The first thing that happens is you slow
down.
And rereading is a version of slowing
down. You either read more slowly the
first time or you have to read and
reread and reread and reread. You slow
down. We're going to get back to why
this matters in a minute. Second, you
don't understand. Third,
come on.
>> You get aggravated.
Then you're done. Right? Done.
Now, when this happens to you and you
reread and reread, why did you do that?
Why didn't you just stop?
>> Because I need to read the content or
understand the content of this paper.
>> That's exactly right. What do you
suppose happens if they don't need to
read it?
>> They don't.
The problem is, forgive me for saying
this, you have no idea how to handle
that problem.
You don't. You really don't. Why not?
How many things have you written in your
life? Imagine the number of categyy
stuff. Forget the letters and all that
kind of stuff. Academicy stuff. Order of
magnitude. I don't know. 300 300 text.
Let's make it up. 500,000. I don't know
how many is. Let's make it up. I'll make
it up. 200. 200. 100. About 100. She's
better with 100. You've written a 100
academic texts in your life.
Did the reader stop reading them?
>> Did they?
>> Never.
>> No. Why not?
>> They were grading it.
>> They were grading it. Let's be a little
more crude about it. They were paid.
Oh my god. Guys, academics get all
freaked out when I talk about money. I
said, "Guys, I got news for you. Your
teachers read your stuff because they
were paid to what were your teachers
reading your text
to think about the world?
That's not what they're paid to do. Why
were your teachers reading your text?
Why were people paying them to do it? To
change the way they see the world?
No. Why?
>> Teachers
read texts
because they are paid to care about the
students.
You've learned to write in a system
where you're writing to readers who are
paid to care about you.
That will stop.
That will stop. Right?
That will stop. The rules that you've
learned about writing were rules that
were generated in the system where you
are writing to somebody who's paid to
care about you.
That's over
in the real in the world beyond school.
I call it a real world, but I'm not sure
it's real. It's just the world beyond
school. They're not paid to care about
you. Why are they reading
Why are they reading your stuff? Why
will they read it? The journals
your colleagues
>> if they think it's relevant for their
work
>> because they think it's valuable to
them.
How much of student work is valuable to
the faculty to which the students are
writing?
And by the way, some faculty who said to
you, "Oh, your work was so val. Thank
you." They were lying.
No, they were lying. It was valuable to
them, but it was valuable to them
because they learned that people
misunderstood things in ways they had no
idea people could misunderstand.
Hm. Faculty sometimes look at me and
say, "Oh, no, no, Larry, you're wrong."
"No, no, no. Student writing is actually
actually professionally valuable." I
say, "Then did you publish it?"
Then if you didn't, it's plagiarism.
And they say, "Well, no, actually, it
wasn't that valuable." Look, here's the
problem you've got. Yeah. Your writing
needs to be clear. Sure. Your writing
needs to be organized.
The rules that govern this are not what
you think they are. In fact, they're not
rules.
Yes, your writing needs to be
persuasive. This is way more important
than this. But more than anything else,
from now on, your writing needs to be
valuable
because if it's not that, nothing else
matters. It makes zero difference.
Faculty come into my office
and forgive me for the drama, but in my
office there's two chairs in the writing
corner. I have a chair at my desk and
then there's two chairs over here.
There's my chair and then there's a
writer's chair. And next to the writer's
chair is a box of Kleenex.
And I'm not kidding
because I have people coming to me
saying I'm not getting they're not
accepting my proposal. They're not
accepting my draft. I get faculty who
come in and say they're not publishing
my work. And of course there's Kleenex
there because like you know careers are
depending on it.
And sometimes it's because it's not
clear. And sometimes it's because it's
not organized. And sometimes it's
because it's not persuasive. But
overwhelmingly,
it's because it's not valuable.
And the other stuff doesn't matter. If
it's clear and useless, it's useless.
It's organized and useless, it's
useless. It's persuasive and useless,
it's useless.
That's the way it is.
Now, this terrifies people because they
make the mistake. Fortunately, I'm
talking to social scientists. Physical
scientists don't have this mistake.
They think value lies here.
They think, "Oh my god, what if my ideas
just aren't valuable?" That's a dopey.
There's no such thing as value here.
Value's here.
The question is whether this particular
community of readers values it, which is
why it's so much about readers and not
about content. Can you imagine writing a
text which one group of readers thinks
is terrifically useful and another group
of readers thinks is useless? Well,
yeah. I got to tell you, sometimes PhD
students come into my office and say, "I
really got to get this article
published. I'm under so much pressure to
publish. I got to publish." And I say,
"Okay, what journals are you going to
submit it to?" and they look at me and
say,"What does that matter?"
Because they think it needs to be clear.
It needs to be organized. It needs to be
persuasive. And those are just sort of
in the thing itself or anybody could
look at it and decide it's clear. That's
crazy wrong. But most importantly is
valuable. Value lies in readers, right?
Not in the thing.
And so how people can think about their
writing without thinking about readers
is probably the biggest challenge you
face. You've been trained to think about
writing formally rule governed.
You have to stop and you have to think
about readers, not generic readers. God
help you if you came up in a system with
standardized tests where you had to
write papers for a standardized reader
like on an AP test or an SAT test.
That's disastrous because it
specifically teaches you not to think
about any differences between readers.
We are going to be talking about
differences between readers and thinking
about those differences because that's
what I think is how writing actually
works except in the bizarre world of
standardized testing. So, I'm going to
pass these out.
>> I wanted to hear.
>> Okay, turn to the first page. And here's
what I want to do very quickly. I want
to imagine that this is a group of uh by
the way, any biologists in the group?
Wonderful. Because biologists have to
leave. Um, no, this is a this is a this
is a a test about it has to do with
content has to do with biology. And I
don't want you to know anything about it
because I want you to be responding to
the language, the writing of it. So,
here's what I'm going to ask you to do.
We're going to read two imagined uh
contenders for a grant or publication,
and we're going to decide which of these
two we're going to publish. Okay? I'm
going to read. You stay with me as I
read. 1. A. As a consequence of the cost
of sex, the theoretical probability of
clonal and sexual coexistence is low.
This is not sociology. This is biology.
As a consequence of the cost of sex, the
theoretical probability and clonal of
clonal and sexual coexistence is low.
Observation of coexistence in vertebrae
taxa has been reported within the frozen
niche variation model. The relevant
parameter is difference in overall niche
breadth. A wider niche breath for the
sexuals and for the clones is predicted
in performances in monocultures.
Performances and mixtures do not
indicate such a relationship. Switching
of behaviors or resource use patterns
between mixed and pure cultures may be
the cause. Post study will examine the
predictions of the FNB model. Okay, as
again I hope you didn't understand any
of that. 1B. As a consequence of the
cost of sex, the theoretical probability
of clonal and sexual coexistence is low.
Nonetheless, observation of coexistence
in vertebrae taxa has been widely
reported. Within the accepted model of
frozen niche variation, coexistence is
explained by difference in overall niche
breadth. However, although the FNV model
correctly predicts wider niche breadth
for the sexuals and for the clones, its
predictions are inconsistent with
reported performances in mixtures. The
proposed study will examine whether the
anomaly may be explained by the
switching of behaviors or research use
patterns between mixed and pure
cultures. Which of these were going to
be more likely to fund? Second one, of
course, why? Now, tell me why.
>> It laid out why their work was important
or how it
>> Okay, I'm going to I'm going to be
really big on particular words, right?
Important.
Right. the first thing you said. Now
imagine if you're the writer of 1A
and we said to her, "Your work doesn't
seem important."
What's her likely response?
>> You obviously didn't understand.
>> You obviously didn't understand it. And
we said, "All right, fix it.
Make it better. What is this is crucial.
What is that writer likely to do if we
said we didn't it's not important and
the writer thinks you didn't understand
it. They're about to make a gigantic
mistake because they would do what?
>> What do you do when somebody says to
you, "I don't understand."
>> You explain.
Do not do that.
[Laughter]
You think I'm kidding?
Why do I not want you to explain? And by
the way, why did your teachers want you
to explain?
Why did your teachers want you to
explain stuff?
>> They want to know what you're what
you're thinking.
>> Because they wanted to know whether you
understood it. You guys don't know how
to explain stuff. You explain stuff
under the model of demonstrating to
somebody that you understand it. That's
how you've learned to explain. You don't
even know. You know that you've done
this. You have learned that what
explaining is, it's revealing to the
world the inside of your head.
No one cares about the inside of your
head.
At least not unless you pay us.
If you pay us to care, we will care,
right?
But in the real world, you're going to
stop paying your readers to care about
the inside of your head. Here's a shock.
You think writing
is conveying your ideas.
It's not.
Let me say that again. You think that
writing is communicating your ideas to
your readers. It is not.
What is professional writing?
Professional writing. What is it?
It's not conveying your ideas to your
readers.
>> It's changing their ideas.
Nobody cares what ideas you have.
This is way more radical than it sounds.
I used to make the mistake of saying to
students who came in I teach argument a
lot and I say to students who make an
argument why do you think that and then
I realize this is a horrible question
it's a teacherly question a teacher says
why do you think that because the
teacher wants to know what what's in his
head I said oh my god I'm doing the same
thing so now I don't say to him why do
you think that I say now why should I
think that
>> because I think that
And guess what? That doesn't work.
Right? Which is interesting. Why it
doesn't work in academia? Why doesn't it
work in academia? Why doesn't that work
of professionals? This is a great
question, right? Why is it that I don't
say, "Okay, you think it, I'll think
it." Why does it not work in I mean, at
least it's not supposed to work in
sometimes it works. But why is it not
supposed to work in an academic realm?
>> Because we are all stubborn.
>> Because what?
>> We all stubborn. Well, that's probably
why it does work, but that's not why
it's supposed to work.
>> It's new.
>> Supposed to critically examine
everything
>> because there's a rule of Western
academia.
It's rule that's of course broken in the
breach a million times. But the rule
says nothing will be accepted as
knowledge or understanding until it has
been challenged by someone competent to
challenge it.
That's the rule.
This is very important because it
changes your readers. Look,
teachers read because they're paid to
care about writers.
Some readers in the world in many cases
read to find out information they need.
If you go to somebody on the quad and
say, "Excuse me," or somebody stops you
on the quad and says, "Excuse me, can
you tell me how to get to the library?"
And you say, "Okay, yeah, go over there
and turn right and go up there." They
don't say, "Well, I doubt that.
because they're not they don't as
readers have the function of challenging
what you say. But at least in theory and
in a lot of practice, your readers are
different from those readers on the quad
and they're way different from teachers.
Your readers have the professional
function of challenging what you say.
So explaining turns out only to happen
inside of these two functions. You only
explain inside of value having been
generated and persuasion having begun.
It is an enormous mistake of PhD level
writers that they try to explain first.
And I know why you try to explain first.
Because in school they just wanted you
to explain first because the whole thing
was just about seeing what you know.
Start explaining. Line one classic
thing. Begin with the definition.
Teachers love this. Begin with the
definition because it tells the teachers
that you what you know the definition.
Don't begin with definition guys. All
right. So back to B.
How you going to make it important? How
do you make it important?
Now, the second word you said,
>> oh no, that's a terrible word.
Do me a favor. Do me a favor. Take the
word new or worse, original.
If you think that you're here to do new
and original work, if you would find the
syninnapse in your brain that is storing
those words, kill it.
No. And people say to me, "Oh, does that
mean I'm here to do non-original work?"
No.
But you are not here to do original
work. You are here to do valuable work.
What's the difference?
You think you're here to create new
knowledge? Well, you know how hard it is
to create new knowledge. We can create
new knowledge in the next 30 seconds.
All we have to do is count up the number
of people who are in this room because
nobody in the world knows how many
people are in this room.
No one knows. And we will create new
knowledge right now. We'll just count
the people in this room. We'll say,
"Okay, now we know." Is anybody going to
read that paper? Why not?
They're going to say, "Who cares how
many people are in that room?" Dear
friend of mine, when I was a PhD student
here,
discovered
journals written by a woman in the late
part of the 19th century
in England. She traveled around the
world and every year she wrote a journal
and somehow they ended up in a library
in Norwich. and she was over in Norwich
one day and she stumbled into a back
room and there's all these journals with
tons of dust on them. She blew up the
dust and she said, "My gosh, it's
amazing. This woman traveled the world
for 30 years and wrote a journal every
time you travel." She came back here,
wrote up a grant and said, "Whoa, I want
to spend three months studying this."
And she got her money and she went over
to Norwich and she spent three months
and she read the whole thing and she
wrote it all up and she handed it to a
committee and in an hour and a half they
sent it back and they said, "You've got
to be kidding."
She said, "Well, I'm going to get my
dissertation. I'm going to get green
now, right?" They said, "You've got to
be kidding. Of course, we're not going
to give you your PhD." And she said,
"But but but but but nobody in the world
knew what this woman said, right?" They
said, "And we still wish we didn't know
what she said because we do not care."
And she said, "But it's original
research."
She said, "I guarantee you it's new."
And they said, "That's right. It's new
and it's original,
but it is not knowledge.
And she said, "That's ridiculous. It has
to be knowledge." No, it's not
ridiculous.
She was living in a positivistic world
where knowledge looks like this. In a
positivistic world, knowledge is just
built up over time. And anytime you find
out something that people didn't know,
you get to just add up to this model and
knowledge just keeps on growing and
everybody's happy. And that is dead.
Dead. Well, mostly dead. Here's the
model. Now,
sorry. These are people.
These are human beings. There are
conversations moving through time and
there's a bunch of people and they get
to say what knowledge is and that
horrifies you. Why would those people
get to say? Why did they get to say?
Especially because historically, of
course, they've looked just like me.
[Laughter]
As my niece says to me every time she
sees me, too male, too pale, too stale.
Why on earth would these people get to
say what knowledge is? I get it.
I get it. Big problem. But they do. And
that's a fact.
These people get to say what counts as
knowledge. The good news is they are
changing.
Way too long, way too late, way too
slow, but they're changing. But the
point is that's the way it works. You
may not like it, but that's the way it
works. They get to say,
so they get to say, "Yep, you're right.
That was new. I didn't know how many
people were in 302, but it doesn't count
as knowledge. It doesn't have any value
to us. Doesn't count."
The good news is this thing just moves
does move through time. The other good
news is this boundary is permeable.
stuff comes in
and unlike this model, stuff goes out. I
like to think of academic conversations
as sort of excreting as they go. Stuff
gets left behind. It's not like this
where everything gets added up is always
there forever. That's not the way it
works. They go along for a while. They
think of things for a while and they
say, "Whoop, that was dumb. Don't think
that anymore." They go along for a while
and they say, "Whoa, we were doing that.
Don't do that anymore." It's not this
buildup model. This buildup model
assumed that everything was right. We
don't think that. We think a lot of what
we think right now is wrong. We just
don't know what the wrong is. And we
don't know what better is. We want to
know. We do. We want to get better at
it. But in order for us to do that, you
have to be dealing with the stuff we say
is knowledge.
that might not feel good. But that's how
it works.
So important isn't going to do it.
New isn't going to do it. Original isn't
going to do it. Because I talk to people
and they say, you know, people don't
think this is val. They're not
publishing it. Well, somebody says they
don't think it's important. So, you know
what they do? They say this important
study.
Well, no.
What is it about B that makes it feel
important?
What is it? Tell me the words on the
page. There's
>> Oh, there's there's like a first
disconnect between a
>> Here's what I literally want you to do.
I want you to literally everybody in the
room, I want you to literally go through
1B and circle the words, the specific
words that are making it valuable to the
audience, to the readers. What's the
first verb you see? A word, not verb.
What's the first word you see that makes
it valuable?
>> Nonetheless.
>> Nonetheless. Next.
>> Accepted.
>> Accepted is but actually widely
accepted.
Next.

anomaly. Here's my first piece of advice
to you that you can use to make your
writing better starting this afternoon.
Spend 15 minutes a week for the rest of
this year taking articles in your field.
Print them out so you have a hard copy.
Go through and circle every word in the
writing that is creating value to the
readers.
If you see an article that you think
doesn't have any of those words, send it
to me. I'll give you my email. Send me
your email and say, "Larry, I found an
article that doesn't do it." Here's what
I bet you will see none. I will see 10.
Now, 10's five. I guarantee you five.
Likely 10. What's going on? How come you
don't see them and I see five or 10? You
missed them here.
I see them. I know the code.
Every community has its own codes. The
communities you're entering have their
own codes. A set of words that
communicates value. You must know the
codes of the communities you're working
in. And they are particular to
communities. Some codes are shared among
a bunch of communities. Some aren't.
You've got to know. You got to know. You
spend 15 minutes a week for the rest of
this year, you'll be doing two things.
One, you'll be training yourself to look
for the code of what creating value. The
other thing you'll be doing, if you're
smart, is you'll be writing down each of
those words and you'll be creating an
invaluable word list.
So that when it's a week before
something is done and you're doing one
of your revisions, you're going to do
what? You're going to do the same thing
on your own work. And if you can't
underline 10 words in the first two
paragraphs, you're going to do what?
You're going to go to the word list and
you're going to jump them in.
Ryan, sometimes sometimes it's that
simple. Sometimes we take articles that
wouldn't get published and in an hour we
do things and they get published.
Sometimes weeks. I'm not suggesting this
is always magic, but sometimes it's
magic cuz sometimes the problem are
pretty simple. The problems have to do
with these people. You have to know
them. As I say to undergraduates who
look at me and they say, "Why does it
take six years or five years or even
four years to get a PhD? Aren't they
just learning more stuff? No. Half their
time is spent learning more stuff. The
other half is learning their readers.
I will say this again. If you do not
know your readers, the particular people
in a community,
if you do not know these people,
you are very unlikely to create value
and you are very unlikely to be
persuasive
because persuasion depends on what they
doubt. If you don't know what they
doubt, how on earth are you going to
overcome those doubts? You must know
them.
It's not enough to know your subject
matter. You got to know your readers.
Okay. So, what is it about none? There's
two things going on here then. One of
them has to go on with the community of
readers. Tell me the words you underline
that has to do with the community
of the word you underline in B. Which
words have to do with the community?
>> Widely,
>> widely
>> accepted.
>> Accepted.
>> Reported.
>> Reported. Those are words that cued that
there was a community of people who want
to understand this.
You don't have those words. You're not
signaling any community.
What do the other words do? Nonetheless,
however, although, what do they do?
>> They create a flow to a certain extent.
>> They do.
and find the syninnapse in your head
that has that word and kill it.
>> Okay,
>> here's what's going on. He has been told
or taught or learned
that in order to have persuasive, clear,
organized pros,
you had to have what are sometimes
called flow words or are sometimes
called transition words. Words like
because and if and unless and however
and although
and and and
but.
All right. Are those words bad? Those
words aren't bad. I It's bad to have is
it bad to have flow? It's not bad to
have flow. But they have nothing to do
with value.
Why? What's the difference between and
and but in creating value?
>> That challenges the point making someone
else.
>> That's it.
Imagine if you go to your readers and
say, "Hey readers, hey community,
hey community,
I've read your stuff. I've thought about
what you think
and I have something to say.
Hey readers, I've read your stuff. I
know what you think,
but
you're wrong.
Which one are they going to pay
attention to?
It's hard when you try to publish on
journals because if you say the people
are wrong and those are your editors.
>> Here's what here's what I will say and
if somebody wants to do it right now
check it.
He can name a journal. We will go to the
every edition of that journal in the
last 20 years and every paper will say
that somebody's wrong.
Everyone.
Now he just wait what's the difference?
He says and he's been and I understand
it. I can't go to these editors and say
they're wrong.
And I am telling you that every article
published in that journal in the last 20
years has opened by saying readers are
wrong.
First is looking at me like I don't
believe it. Oh look what's the
difference?
>> I guess there is a difference between
saying
things saying that is wrong and like
nullifying the knowledge all together
and contributing knowledge.
>> Yeah. One way to put it is
you have to know the code.
You have to know the code. If you say to
the people who are the dominant figures
in your field, you know what? I've read
all your stuff and you're idiots.
Not going to go well,
right? Don't say that. What did you say
to them?
The dominant figures in their field.
>> I would build them their knowledge to
show that they're wrong.
>> I say,
what do you say to them?
>> You've been thinking about this wrong
and I have value.
>> Yeah, but if you want to learn the code,
what do you suppose the code is?
>> Well, you address exactly what you think
there is.
>> Yeah, but the code is Wow. Are you
smart?
>> Wow.
Me. Whoa. I'm just amazed. You are so
smart and you've contributed and you've
advanced this
you've advanced this community through
in fabulous ways,
but
there's this little thing you got here
that's wrong.
And now they say, "Oh,
well, thank you for appreciating it."
But what do you think? What do you think
we have wrong? And then you better have
an argument, not an explanation.
Do not explain. Argue. You're talking to
people who like wrote this stuff. You
don't have to explain it to them. You
have to predict what they're going to
doubt when you say they're wrong. So you
say to them, "You're wrong about this."
And they say, "Why should I agree that
I'm wrong?" And you say, "Well, here's
why." That's what introductions do. They
give a quick version of why these people
should think that they're wrong
and they say, "Well, okay,
preliminarily, I've read your first two
pages. Now, I'll start reading the rest
of it." Why? Because you've caused them
to think that your work might be
valuable for them. Imagine if you go to
them and say, "Wow, your work has been
really great and now here's something
new that you didn't know." See, here's
what happens. People say to me, "Man, if
I say that they've done something wrong,
I'm taking a huge risk." True. You think
you're not taking a risk if you do this.
What's the risk you run if you do this?
Hey, really smart people? I've done all
your work. I've studied all your stuff
and I have something I want to add.
No, no, no. That's actually a really
good reaction, right? What's the risk
you run there
when you say there's something I want to
add?
>> We don't care.
Or worse,
I'd like to put my voice into the
conversation.
Say, we don't have any reason to listen
to it.
Let's pause on that one for a minute.
The University of Chicago writing
program is not real popular in the world
of writing programs.
And you can see why.
A lot of people think we're fascists.
I don't dispute it. Here's what we teach
people to do. We say, "Identify the
people with power in your community and
give them what they want."
That's what we teach people to do.
Lots of people have said to us in some
version or another, you're supposed to
teach people to
challenge
the existing community. Well, actually,
I just did, right? But notice that I did
it inside the terms of the community.
People say, why don't you teach people
to have their own individual voice?
And I'm going to say, I get that
argument. I get the moral and ethical
pressure to teach people to have their
individual voices.
But when I sit with somebody up in my
office who's worried about their career
not going anywhere,
it can't be about their individual
voice. It's about what's going to make
it valuable to their readers.
You need to understand that this program
that we have is motivated by those
people who have come to us and said our
writing is not succeeding and the whole
program is aimed at them. How do you
make them help them succeed? There's a
ton of ethical issues involved in that.
We're not going you don't really care. I
just want to put them out there. There's
also the personal at risk issue. You
want me to go to this really important
person, this the editors of this
journal, and tell them they're wrong.
Yeah, I do. I need you to do it under
the code. You want to do it under the
code. There's polite ways to do it.
There's insulting ways to do it. You
need to learn how they do it in that
community. If you don't do it in the way
they code it, you're going to get
slapped down. What if you don't do it at
all?
You're going to get rejected.
Right? So, all right.
Sorry for the drama. Oh my gosh.
Especially because we're on page one of
a 30-page handout. All right.
