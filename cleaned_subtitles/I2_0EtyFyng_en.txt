BL for for fore for for for for TV the 79th Secretary of the Treasury Scott Besson secretary Besson it's good to see you sir joh good to see you a warm congratulations from all of us to you quite an arrival from what was it Little River South Carolina yes it's an American success story all in America to the office of Alexander Hamilton with some unique experience how is that going to help you sir approach some of the challenges in this economy well Jonathan the way I look at it for my career for 35 years I've been sort of sitting outside the the room with my ear up against the door or trying to look over the transom trying to figure out what policy makers should do or going to do and how that would affect the markets now I'm inside the room trying to figure out what everybody outside the room expects us to do how the Market's going to react and the what the economic and market implications are shortterm but more importantly medium-term and how that's going to affect the underlying economy we've got a lot to discuss so let's start with the debt Market what people expected you to do make B was changed some of the issuance for treasury something that you'd said back last summer about then secretary Yellen was that Yellen had taken control of of monetary policy through treasury issuance then you're basically maintaining her plans can you help explain that help us understand where you're coming from sure so the I the previous administration shortened some of the duration and we haven't shortened it further we've just kept the policy in place and I believe over the medium term it's going to uh play out as it becomes clear that everything that President Trump's Administration is doing uh will bring will be disinflationary we're going to bring down energy cost we're going to bring down regulation um what doge is doing in terms of cost cutting and I think once the tax tax cuts and job acts the is um made permanent then you know we can have a revenue increase cost decrease and as you said as the nation's top Bond salesman I got a pretty good story so what's the medium- term help me understand that what is the medium- term and then once you see all those things let's say those Ambitions become reality then do you start to think about Turing out the debt uh sure but that's that's a long way off and we're going to see what the market wants as Lisa noted this morning that the and it's to see someone who believes that fed minutes are exciting that the the FED said that they may stop their balance sheet runoff so you know easier for me to extend duration when I'm not competing with another big seller so when do you think that time would be end of the year or further down into the administration's term yeah it it's going to be it's going to be past dependent you we're still seeing sort of the residual B inflation that's still coming through uh and I I think as a the market starts to realize what we're doing and um inflation starts to drop then we will we will see so it's going to be path dependent that's the eventual goal but you know I'm not going to Signal it now when you mention the for for B minutes participants indicated yesterday that one of the problems s they had was they were waiting for Trump policies to come into place do you think that those policies when you think of tariffs potentially deportations immigration this can be inflationary is it going to hold back the fed from cutting rates uh well to the extent the team transitory at the FED is still the uh has any credibility I would say that tariffs if they have any price adjustments are the most transitory thing there are so I I don't think that should hold them back very long and I I would point out that depending on what number you want to use 10 20 million uh people who came across the border we had the worst inflation in 40 years when we added 10 or 20 million people so I'm not sure why people are say saying that the it's inflationary to tell them to go home so when you look at Team transitory do you think the next move for them would be a cut uh and Marie I have uh said publicly that I will talk about what the FED has done uh when I was Market commentator and investor I would talk about what they should do uh now I will leave it to them and Cher poell and I have a weekly breakfast we saw each other yesterday and I will convey my thoughts there well let's talk about what they have done we can comment on that you said you're willing to they cut rates 100 basis points going into the end of last year and another thing happened yields at the long end Rose they didn't decline do you think Federal Reserve easing contributed to higher long end yields well well Jonathan I would just say the point of cutting rates is to cut rates so if they cut rates and rates went up then there probably was the uh some something there um I I thought that the rate cut in September I said it may maybe even on your show here that it it was oversized uh the market responded but now we're seeing term premium come back down so uh you know we'll see what happens from here do you think the current rate right now is enough to bring down 10year yields over time time just by virtue of being restrictive again I'm not going to comment on current policy I am curious you talk about how you do look at the 10-e yield every single day I love that I love that you're the top Bond salesman in the United States and I'm wondering are you expecting it or hoping it to go down from here is that necessary to reach to achieve your 3% growth Target well what what's necessary are the underlying conditions so the underlying conditions that we we need for yields to come down for growth to go back up we've got this affordability crisis in housing we've got an affordability crisis in the auto payments so you know one thing that would be very stimulative and as Jonathan mentioned earlier that 10 years come down or rates have come down every week since Donald Trump's been president so you know if we can continue that for 52 weeks that'd be great uh and it'd be very it would be a win for the American people which at the end of the day that is our goal so um if we do what we say we're going to do if we can re in the budget deficit if we have non-inflationary growth if we bring down Energy prices and you know I think now that I have the numbers on the inside there was a big contributor to this massive inflation was uh regulation you know I think you said earlier this morning uh that the um what if these things CA inflation you know some as an Marie just said some of the policies well what really happened under the previous administration was you created a demand shock with government spending but it was met by Supply constraints as there was more regulation and Trump 1.0 we created a demand shock with tax cuts and it was met by supply side response of less regulation so you know the Biden Administration created this inflation that a demand shock and constraining Supply is the ultimate recipe for inflation so for for fore and now you want to cut spending the Doge program let's talk about it you've called it one of the most important audits to government ever you remember that Clinton tried something similar the National Partnership for Reinventing government how different will this be and what kind of cost savings are you and the team thinking about yeah and John I can go all the way back the uh given my tenure in the business I can go all the way back to the 80s to the grace commission and they they had some great the ideas most of them not implemented uh I think that the Clint Clinton Gore initiative I think a lot of that was academics so you this is people on the ground uh all all areas of government and you know it's moving quickly and I I really do think it's unfortunate that it's been lampooned and the uh attacked the way it has but when it's being attacked like this it tells me that there are a lot of entrenched interest in terms when you're moving people's cheese they they don't like it and it's not their cheese it's the American people's cheese well how about putting some of that cheese back into American people's pockets how inflationary would those $5,000 potential Doge checks be that the president spoke about yesterday well I I think again that if we are bringing down energy prices if we are uh cutting the regulation so I you know I think that it's a um to to quote the vice president during the campaign I think it's holistic and I think that um it it's all kind of one mosaic if if you were to inject a lot of money into the economy because you know and think about this that we are at the uh this massive deficit to GDP 6.7 almost 7% so what'll be happening on one side you'll be bringing down that spending in the economy so you know very easy mental model is every 300 billion is about 1% of GDP so every 300 billion that doge is able to save could you put that back in the economy into people's pockets one thing potentially that could happen and people are questioning it is maybe remarking gold Elon mus who's leading Doge was talking about maybe going to Fort Knox to make sure those gold reserves are there that comes under your purview do you have any plans to visit Kentucky uh I I don't have any plans I can tell you that that we do an audit every year I can tell tell the American people on on camera right now that the there was a report September 30th 2024 all the gold is there any US senator who wants to come and visit it can arrange a visit through our gold was your biggest holding when you were a hedge fund manager before you divested to become the treasury secretary so you know the value of where gold is right now versus where it's marked on its balance sheet just north of $40 an ounce it's close to 3,000 is it under consideration for this Administration to revalue Gold uh I think that somehow when I we were talking about the Sovereign wealth fund and I said monetize the balance sheet I can promise you that's not what I had in mind so it's not under consideration not on the table that's not what I had in mind when you look at the Doge savings that you have so far how much is that going to go to offset some of the uh tax extensions that we see what other savings are you looking at that potentially are crucial well again they're they're just getting started and uh one one of the shocking things to me has been you when we talk about waste Fraud and Abuse uh we all think of you know what comes out of DC we think of some waste and fraud and friction costs cuz you know one way to think about this is 25% of the US economy flows through Washington DC so if we can cut the friction on that you know that's a lot of savings uh what I we are discovering now in waste Fraud and Abuse there may be much more fraud going on than we thought and I think you're going to be hearing about that over the coming weeks can we hear about it now uh I think you'll be hear about it on the coming weeks what kind of fraud are you thinking about what kind of fraud have you identified uh again the I I'd refer you to now the I'd refer you to some of the statements by Lee zeldon at the EPA okay [Music]
