[Music] hi everybody and welcome to in Good Company I'm Nikolai tangan and the CEO of the Norwegian s wealth fund and today we are talking to W saan the CEO of shell now most of us associate shell with a pit stop on the road but shell is an incredible company exploring producing refining trading transporting you know things in car ships planes and so on in fact I've read that the amount of energy you extract in one day is enough to drive a car back back and forth through the moon more than 18,000 times we own 3% of the Company accounting for more than6 billion us so well soam welcome to this book call thank you very much NCA now you are um both lebanes and a Canadian citizen so tell me um what uh how has this shaped you as a person you think uh look I think uh diversity of thought diversity of experiences is at the core I suspect of how I've grown up um I I actually lived uh only 5 years in Canada and I've never lived in Lebanon yet of course both have had tremendous influence through through culture what they have done has made me uh accept the different perspectives that people have in different contexts and to learn from that um and I think most importantly to build resilience um the Lebanese unfortunately are known for resilience given the many challenges the country has had and I think resilience is what we need in particular in times of change as we currently have geopolitically in the energy system and beyond now we live in a society now where there is in many cases very little resilience do you think that background uh really has given you more resilience I believe so I I think unfortunately uh one only gets to appreciate what one's H what one has when it's taken away from them and often I always take my kids back to Lebanon to see my father and my wife's parents um and it's when they are in Lebanon that they get appreciate some of the luxuries that they enjoy having lived in Europe in the US even in other parts of the Middle East simple thing like when they take a lift um when it's in Lebanon they know not to take the lifts because unfortunately typically the lift gets stopped because of power cuts um or they get used to for example sometimes the lights going out for an hour or two hours because the generator that has been driving the company the building's uh utilities goes down but gotten used to a bit more of that and I think those small elements of appreciation of what we have what the Energy System of today's world actually can do to be able to deliver the Comforts that we all enjoy we should never take for granted it's such a core part of what we all I think enjoy in life at least majority of us enjoy in life um but a lot of people still just do not have that that access to energy 700 million people today live without access to electricity some 2 and a half billion in general do not have access to available cooking uh fuels and the like so those are some of the elements that I think we shouldn't forget now you have a background as a chemical engineer and you've been at Shell for 26 years and bang you are the CEO um what are the advantages of having spent so long time in a company before you take over look I think it's important to understand the context of the company its history its present and the Ambitions to go into the future and it's tougher to do that if haven't actually gotten to see the company from within as you rightly say I I am a chemical engineer that's allowed Me Maybe the biggest learning I have from chemical engineering is to understand systems uh endtoend systems because that's what the energy system is you need to be able to look not just at what one end of it whether that's the supply side or the demand side it's the all the whole integrated value chain from Supply through the Midstream infrastructure all the way to the demand side and how it all comes together that plays in technology that plays in product flows it plays across the entire patch and I think chemical engineering is a great field to be able to learn about that and having been in Shell for some 26 27 years now and worked in the Upstream worked in the gas part of the company worked in the downstream in the retail part of the company and worked in the Renewables part of the company as well it allows you to start to see how the pieces fit together into a hole so you've been you've been Sono for one year what was the big surprise taking over the Reigns look I think there is something fundamentally different as you grow through the company where of course your overall requirement in terms of time spent and the need to be able to understand grow but suddenly becoming the face of the company both internally and externally of course I'd appreciate it I'd intellectualized but it's very different when you actually get into that position and you recognize how important every action is how important every word is because people are looking at that how long did shell um groom you for the Zoll I I suspect I mean the day that I got onto the executive committee in 2019 um of course created a step change in the profile in the company um but I suspect it was before that I mean I had maybe my most defining period was in 2012 when I was given the opportunity to lead our Ki business I was in Doha at the time and I stepped a ro which if I was if I'm honest with you Nikolai I thought to myself I think they've gotten the wrong guy for this job this is just too big and you and was and was it too big I mean the first six months uh you know I uh I lost around four five kilograms cuz I was just from 5 in the morning to midnight just working and working and working more to be able to get to know the people we had 1,600 people on site um and I I before I took over that job I was running the commercial and new business team of around 20 people so I had a long way to go and not just getting to know them by giving speeches getting to know them by going to understand their business to understand their their challenges their dilemmas and then building trust um and I think that leadership Journey uh gave shell the opportunity to be able to say let's let's see whether this person can be one of the many terrific candidates that one day could lead chill and why do they pick you at the end I think what I brought at this point in time in Shell is we felt our strategy was clear and my track record of execution was an important part of I think what the board was looking for so then um you're appointed Co what what um advice would you give to people who are who get into those type of situations so I mean what did you what did you do in the beginning a very important piece of advice I got early on was in particular coming from the company and having spent 26 years from in the company the advice was approach it as if if you were an external hire don't get too comfortable with what you've grown up in the paradigms the sacred cows that you have adopted in your 26 27 years in the company approach it like an external CEO will and that was great advice actually just go back and look at the fundamentals really look at the comparators and say where are we actually winning and where are we not and that allowed me as well to sort of lift myself from this is the organizational structure we have today let's continue with it to no let's challenge that organizational structure let's challenge the destination that we're going and make sure that we continue to be absolutely committed to that destination let's challenge the way we execute let's challenge how we execute as a company as well all of that was an important piece of coming in and I would recommend it to anyone uh it's just too easy to fall into the lull of this is how it's always been this is this is therefore how it's always need to needs to be so you launched an efficiency program and also started to C cut some costs um tell me about the program we called it a Sprint um a 10 quarter Sprint and the reason we chose 10 quarters is in our industry you could easily sort of promise things at 5 10 years just given the uh the gestation of many of our projects we didn't feel that we as a new management team could uh simply ask people to trust us we needed to be able to show them they can trust us and therefore 10 quarters was measurable was clear while still giving us enough time to be able to make the changes that we needed to make and we Tred to simplify the focus for the organization and for everyone outside to say there's a couple things we're trying to do more value and less emissions so every decision needs to reflect on the impact we can have on either enhancing value or reducing emissions which should be relatively straightforward and so what we've done as part of that Sprint is we've simplified the top of the house we had nine executive committee members we've leveled that down to to to seven M we had multiple targets we had over 75 operational financial and car and carbon targets we've reduced that to eight four financial and four carbon making it very clear to the organization what it is that we want we upped the performance Cadence speed we have gone now into bi-weekly and monthly performance cadences at the top of the house and that is even more frequent as you go deeper into the organization allowing us to become much clearer on do you have the data that you need to be able to understand whether we're making progress is that data showing that we are making progress where are interventions required so this is a a bels and braces um transformation of the company um a company that has a great culture but one that needs to be supplemented with these three key elements of performance discipline and simplification MH you do a lot of different things at Shell where are you the number one there's a few areas that I think we have been able to demonstrate leadership one is in deep water um we're very pleased with our position and more importantly in the way we continue to execute new projects such as in the Gulf of Mexico we've recently um commissioned our veto project we're in the process of uh working up our whale project our Sparta project so that's a real Heartland for us as is Brazil in the context of deporter LNG would be another area that I think we have excelled at we are um after Q energy the largest player in LG the single largest in terms of uh the international oil and gas companies uh so that's an area where we do have real strength and an area where we see the world really needing a huge amount of gas and LG in particular if we are to decarbonize in the direction we would hope we go another area I think we are particularly strong at is trading uh we have one of the largest trading and optimization houses in the energy sector anywhere in the world um and maybe the last one I'd mention is our marketing organization you started off by referencing the brand and the pit stop as you go around we have 46,000 stations around the world well I have to say I've eaten uh hot dogs in many of them and well they're good right good that's an important feedback now um where are you weak where are we weak um I think in certain areas we have tried to play uh and we have shown ourselves that maybe we're not the best players one area for example is trying to play purely the renewable generation space uh we've tried there we haven't been able to see that we can be competitive in just the renewable generation part why because I think this is doesn't require the same complex systems it's different risk profile um and it doesn't necessarily play to what we bring and what we typically bring is big project management capability integration of different parts of a value chain if you take solar panel installation it's a relatively basic element but I'll give you more a more specific example in that context we were looking at energy access in Africa for example trying to install solar panels there uh for for folks who don't have access to it what ended up H happening is we would need in essence the vehicle that's transporting the solar panel to be surrounded by two safety vehicles to be able to follow our safety protocols we needed harnesses by the time the person got to the roof of the house in which he was installing that panel that's very different than what others would do and so we were actually dis synergizing on the cost structure and so we've said look let's not play in that space let's play across the integrated value chain and partner in that part of the value chain the renewable generation with others so does it mean that you think that the integrated energy companies should not be doing solar no I think if they're going to do solar bring in the partners who are excellent at doing solar and decide why you want to play in the Solar space is there really any synergies between solar and other types of energy I think the biggest Synergy is when you look at the Energy System more holistically what we see at the moment is take the us where we are one of the largest players in gas and power we want to be able to decarbonize our sales of electricity in that market as well as decarbonize both the gas and the power what you find right now is you cannot get access to Green electrons because there aren't enough of them so we need to be able to play sufficiently in the green energy space in the green electron space develop it at some point we can dilute it down to keep a 20% Equity interest but then take a disproportionately larger amount of the green electrons which we can put into our system many of our B2B customers whom we serve with lubricants we serve with gas we serve with all sorts of energy products are demanding green electricity to to come to them as the largest energy Trader and to say well we don't have that wouldn't be the right approach and therefore we're trying to leverage our strength to be able to bring into at Green Green electrons to the system should wind be done by the integrated energy companies again I think playing to one strength on off on onshore wind it's tougher to see what particular we would bring on the offshore side there's more logic to be had for the big players in particular given our deep water experience and the more complex element of offshore wind so what part will shell actually play in the enery transition I think the role we play right now is to be a multi energy player so we see ourselves continuing to produce lower and lower carbon oil we see ourselves being the movers of the largest amount of LG amongst the majors but then we see ourselves playing across lower carbon Solutions both in terms of lower carbon molecular Solutions and where appropriate lower carbon green electron Solutions and what do I mean by that we see ourselves playing in areas such as one day green hydrogen we are developing the largest green hydrogen facility in Europe at the moment in r to them we see ourselves playing in the biospace in low carbon fuels we are the single largest blender of biofuels in the world today we see ourselves playing in in other areas as well such as for example carbon capture and sequestration which is an area we've been working including for example in Norway in the Northern Lights project um and we see ourselves as being able to offer our customers nature-based solution for example carbon credits and the like so really looking at the holistic system but focusing on the areas where we have differentiated capabilities and competitive strengths now you Tred to develop both e uh both electrical vehicle charging and biofuel does it make sense to kind of ride both those horses I think it does I mean I think at the end of the day there are two major sectors that we um we serve today the transport sector whether that's passenger vehicles Commercial Road Transport Aviation or shipping as well as the industrial sectors they both need different things so for example passenger vehicles needs EV charging so while we have been selling traditionally gasoline and Diesel we see a growing pool of demand for EV charging and so we can actually synergize with our existing retail sites and add the option of EV charging whereas biofuels are slightly different biofuels we see much more akin to playing to our customers in the shipping space in the Aviation Space with sustainable Aviation fuels and in the commercial Road Transport space now a lot of companies are trying trying to reposition themselves as you know integrated um renewable companies and so on um and I think what's interesting is that the stock market is rewarding them in different ways depending on when they come with various types of announcements so at some stage is very good to spend more time on Renewables and then companies change tax and say they're going to do less of it and then the share prices go up on it I mean how how do stock markets shape what you think I think it's important to listen to shareholders But ultimately we are also driving a long-term strategy and I don't think the two are in Conflict what shareholders are saying is show me that you have investable business models that allow me to continue to see cash flow growth in this company that allow me to have the appropriate shareholder returns yeah but that's what they're saying now but they didn't say that 3 four years ago I think there was a much broader context you're absolutely right three four years ago the narrative and not just by shareholders by actually a significant portion of society more acutely here in North West Europe yeah we heard very very loud concerns around any oil and gas production so if we now go back to such a period and you get that same kind of political pressure back will you change your targets and what you aim for I don't think you can be a company that's um in essence the distillation of all the asks of everyone around around the world because in a world that is particularly polarized today geopolitically economically socially what we need to do is to be very clear on who we want to be as a company but that doesn't mean that you do not evolve your strategy depending on where you see value pools and where you see strengths we thought we could potentially play in home energy and selling power to homes that didn't work out for us so we had to change we can't simply keep doing the things that are not working for us but we need to be transparent around that so the number one thing for me is be very clear with our shareholders what our intent is give them as much opportunity to be able to measure our progress as as we can and then let them make the choices I cannot influence the decision of somebody who is simply wanting to bet on oil that's not the company that shell is nor are we a company that's simply going to be an offshore wind company or a Solar Company we want to be the investment case through the energy transition offering multiple energy vectors and that's what we think we are the investment case for and that's what we hope to be able to appeal to our shareholders with how important is a continuation of the inflation reduction act I think it's a critical element and and the reason I say that is one it creates um allow me to say fomo uh you know fear of missing out by many others around the world and you see actually the inflation reduction act has inspired a few other acts around the world for example the EU fit for 55 that um became stronger and better on the back of the inflation reduction act but it also is going to be critical to make sure that the implementation of the inflation reduction act continues as planned the risk is in what are long investment Horizons that significant change in the fiscal and the regulatory framework could undermine confidence in these Investments now the CEO of um Saudi Arabian oil company said recently that it's time to abandon the fantasy of facing out out oil and gas is is it a fantasy to think we'll face it out I think in the coming years one has to be pragmatic and look at the realities we see oil and gas is a critical part of the energy system in fact fossil fuels today are over 80% of the energy system so what we need to do is to be able to continue to find Pathways to reduce the dependence on fossil fuels but it's going to have to be an informed energy transition that does not take away resources from people that need it but is it but is it actually a transition aren't we just adding one energy source onto the other energy source we are today yeah you're right are today and and that and when do you think oil and gas will start to decline uh I think gas has a long way to go uh I think for the next you know at least through the 2040s we see a growing role for gas uh as either a replacement for coal or critically as well as a support as a supplement to uh Renewables because of the intermittency of Renewables um oil products I think will continue to grow through this decade and possibly by as early as the next decade we could start to see a peing of uh of all products demand uh but who knows that's going to depend on demand levels what we see right now is there are new sources of energy demand that we hadn't anticipated just a few years ago like generative AI like crypto mining all of that is actually enhancing the demand for energy rather than reducing it and that's an issue ownership dialogue so we have great dialogue um with you with with you guys um and we appreciate that you really engage with us uh um now how do you think about stakeholder engagement when it comes to things like your latest climate package I I think it's absolutely critical to be first and foremost transparent in everything one does I think we need to be clear what we stand for as a company uh and then to share it with our shareholders I think then dialogue is critical with those who agree with you of which there are many and with those who disagree with us again of which there are many so on the day that we announced our energy transition strategy report which was just 3 weeks ago um I had time dedicated to engagement with staff across the company time dedicated to engagement with shareholders time dedicated to engagements with what we would call climate influencers from around the world uh non-governmental organizations who have a very very strong view on the energy transition not necessarily always an aligned view but good important different views which I think it's critical for us as a company to be listening to to be learning from there's a lot of increasingly there's a lot of legal activity in in this field and of course the big one being whether individual companies need to share the legal obligations of states in terms of cutting emissions and you're in the middle of a big uh a big lawsuit here uh how do you think this will pan out because it's quite it's quite key to your future right yeah so I think that you touch on a couple questions there I think one element of this is what is it that you own as a company we are firmly of a belief that we have accountability for our own emissions what we would typically call scope one and extend it into scope two those are the emissions that we produce from our own activities or which come directly into the S where we produce we also think there's a responsibility that companies like ours have towards scope 3 which is why we adopted scope 3 targets and Ambitions recognizing we don't have all the levers to be able to influence the scope 3 numbers but feeling that if we can lean into to that and set some goals there it'll allow us to work with our customers to shape that those products that we are selling so that's an important element so just to so just to explain here scope three is basically the uh pollution uh caused by the oil sell it's it's the emissions of any product we sell to our customer but the emission is realized when the customer uses the product so it's not you but the customers correct so today if we sell uh you gasoline for example to fuel your car uh when you drive that car roughly 90% of the emissions are actually generated versus the less than 10% emissions generated in the entire value chain all the way from producing the oil to delivering it to your car yeah and so the question is how do we work with our customers to support them on their decarbonization Journey the example I just gave could be that we set up an EV charging point for our customers at the point that they want to invest in an EV uh another Point could be we offer them a bio blend so that we reduce the emission of their vehicle we can sell them lubricants that allow us to also reduce the emissions from the from the use of the the vehicle so there are multiple levers we could potentially apply but we don't have all the levers of control only Nicolai can choose if you want to buy an EV or not those are choices that the customers have to make and so that's that's how we think about that now when it comes to the to the lawsuit I think at the end of the day the end point we're trying to all drive towards is decarbonization and making sure that we ear urgently act on the worst impacts of climate change which is happening around us we experience it today day in day out now the question is what is the best approach is it is it right to put the obligation on a single company in Europe or is it right to do it much more as elected governments choosing how they want to be able to set those policies for Industries to then respond that's a core point of contention that we have in our in our lawsuit um it's not right just for a shell to have the obligation without our customers having that same obligation um the second key element is it's not right for a court to actually determine the strategy of the company that's a question that has to be left to the board so those are some of the elements that we are uh that we are discussing in this uh or that we are um supporting in the lawsuit and we hope to have a bit more insights we're actually through the appeal process over the last week and there's we expect to hear back towards end of the year irrespective of that we continue to focus on what we can control which is the way we run the company and how we actually adhere but to some of the key elements that we have committed to doing but we also have some other activity in the in this space so Exxon is suing activist shareholders you are suing Green Peace um what is this about look at I can talk about what we are doing we fundamentally believe in everyone's right to protest as long as it is lawful and as long as it's safe what happened specifically with green peace this is not a new lawsuit this is something that happened in February of 2023 what happened there was a number of protesters illegally mounted a moving vessel a 72,000 metric ton moving vessel the judge said that that they were putting their own lives at risk and they were putting our crew's life at risk I have no problem with anyone wanting to uh uh protest whether oil and gas should be taking place in the North Sea but to do it in the way that it was done could potentially have significantly hurt our people um moving on to geopolitics we touched upon that um earlier on now um what impact do you see the energy transition having on geopolitics just what is the interplay between the two now it's a heavy interplay um I think at the heart of the energy transition will be the difference between are we going to be a much more globalized world or are we going to become a much more localized protective uh protectionist World those will those will play up um whether the energy corridors the trade corridors of energy flows start to move towards Allied parties um away from what is a free flow of energy um of course disruptions that we see today for example in the Red Sea and and Beyond are having their own impact on on energy flows so so I think the two are significantly interlined moving towards um a split world where you have China Iran Russia on the one side and west on the other is just going to be more deeply embedded in in the world I think there's definitely an element of um what we would call um polarization in the overall geopolitical space and what what are the consequences of that what is it what will it lead to like I think at the end of the world at the end of the day it's going to lead to a uh slower energy transition than would have been desired um the biggest I'm sorry why well the biggest enabler of the energy transition today has been the very lowcost Chinese products that are coming into the market you look at the majority of where the energy transition is happening over 50% of EVS were sold in China last year over 50% of renewable generation was deployed in China and that's because you have less than $10,000 EVs and you're ability to be able to Source cheap solar panels is in China As you move towards the rest of the world affordability constraints start to kick in and therefore as we see more and more protectionist measures that's going to have an impact it will mean of course more local production but it's going to be local production at higher cost that will be more difficult to compete against lower cost energy sources like oil and gas and that's why I think there's a risk of the geopolitical polarization going down the energy transition it will also mean more more and more disruption in in the way energy flows and critically as we look at a larger role for Renewables in the energy sector intermittency is inevitable and therefore the volatility in the energy sector will only increase and volatility we have seen just in the last few years after the the Russian invasion of Ukraine how that volatility plays and impacts everything from cost of living through to voting patterns and Beyond and that is a concern as we look into the future moving on to Cora culture so um shell is basically a merger of two companies shell which was an English company and Royal Dutch uh this is all the way back to 1907 so it's been a little while and then you moved your head your headquarter to to London where you now live but there were also talks about you potentially moving it to America I guess at the time um when you moved just what kind of Cora culture do you have now at Shell how would you define it I think it's really difficult to define a culture um other than to take it back to the core values that the culture espouses and and and our our values have been clear for a long long time now it's all about honesty integrity and respect for for people but your question of course indeed reflects all the way back to when we brought the two parts of shell together and of course there's been an evolution of that culture but we still have that uh Anglo Dutch core that we have always had and always enjoyed as a company our English and Dutch presence of course shapes our history we had some real challenges for example 2004 our reserves crisis and how that shaped the company thereafter under the leadership of yurun vanir at the time all of those actually I think create the culture of of today shell today I think is seen by many as being a heavily a Technology based company Innovation based company um we can sometimes be seen as complex bureaucratic which is one of the key elements we're looking to unwind to simplify the company all of that I think creates unique Elements which we have to start there as we think about where we want to go into the future where do you want to go what part of the CER culture would you like to change look I think it's about evolving that culture because there's a lot of it that I'd like to to keep held together the the the camaraderie the incredible sort of safe place that we have created in the company while making sure that we are able to bring those elements of performance discipline simplification um when I when I came out of or when I started my University my MBA um in 2001 I remember one statement that was said to me on day one this was a har by it was in in Harvard Business School by the dean he said the best leaders are tough-minded but kind-hearted tough-minded but kind-hearted I think we have a kind-hearted culture already now we need to be tough-minded about the choices we make as a company to really focus on the things that that matter in the areas where we can create the most impact both on a value more value perspective as well as a less emissions perspective that's I think our scope for improvement how do you go about changing it I think by being clear are you a very empathetic person I can I can be incredibly empathetic but I can also realize that I can lock in in certain areas that's the danger of being in the in the Ivory Tower and so one of the biggest reprieves for me is getting out there I find I take the most energy and I feel the most connected when I'm on the road visiting our teams it fundamentally changes my mood because it's so so easy to get stuck in meetings meetings meetings and um great theoretical discussions fundamentally different when you're on the front line offshore talking to folks there connecting listening to what the challenges are and where the opportunities are and so I find that that's the biggest energy and therefore now I've integrated it not just in terms of visits but every month I find time to be able to reconnect with people across the organization where my team will look at what are some of the brilliant stories happening in the organization where I can just pick up the phone and call someone and say tell me a bit more about this or thank you for doing what you're doing those areas for me are are incredibly important and that's what creates the the DNA of this company M now um energy companies are very safety conscious and you have to be right but you have to be it you know at the drilling platforms but it often kind of uh uh takes over the whole corpor cultureal the whole group right so at the HQ in some places you have to hold the handrail when you go up the stairs because it's less risky right uh you come into the parking lot and you're supposed to park with your with your back to the wall because you are less tired uh in the morning uh so it's some less risky to park this way right so all this kind of stuff is just like really um uh Perman ating the whole corpor culture how do you how do you make sure that a big company like shell continues to be Innovative and agile we're still learning how to do it if I'm honest with you um we are by the way one of the companies that are required to hold the handrail with the the key element of that ethos being do you hold the handrail when I hold the handrail and my kids hold the handrail as well now and why why is that it's you you learn very quickly that you can't ask the front line to do things that you are not willing to do and so if you're asking folks who should you be holding the handrail in the headquarter look I think at the end of the day the handrail is a proxy for something else the handrail holding the handrail is a proxy for how we are united around our commitment to safety but your question still holds sometimes we do things which are in the context of the risk profile there are limited you don't need to do that thing right um and the handrail has become more symbolic but if you have a symbolic elements you create an incredibly complex organization with everyone going to the lowest common denominator and so what are we trying to do around it we've recognized that we need to have different control Frameworks for different parts of the company we have typically had one shell control framework we are now adopting what we call Shell performance framework that is very unique to the business if you are in Mobility if you are selling fuel that's a different risk profile to if you are Drilling in deep water that's a different risk profile to if you are actually selling lubricants and so what we are trying to do is to build Frameworks risk Frameworks that are specific to the risk profile that's there understanding what your key risks are and then liberating the organization and and one of the one of the biggest things I take pride in over the last couple years we used to have in our safety environment and asset management set of Standards we have around 1,700 standards that's what we had we have challenged ourselves and brought in the experts to say you have to go in and really reduce that to make it sharp and efficient we've reduced that by 70% mhm that will then allow people to say what are the mus haves and then here's a whole bunch of nice to haves but you need to decide whether you are willing to take that on now that's easier said than done because what we still find is even when we say that people still def to the old culture of well let's just keep them just in case and so this is also about building confidence in the organization courage to be able to take on one's own risk and to be able to manage one's risk this is about really becoming accountable and allowing our people to become empowered that doesn't happen in six months it doesn't happen in two years this is a journey of multiple years which we are on but when you have a bureaucratic um a bureaucratic organization like that with so many rules do you do you manage to attract the right type of people people do the right type of people would want to work in in an organization like that we we are one of the things we have been blessed with is we have outstanding people and we continue to attract outstanding how do you get them how do you get them I think there's a few things one is the shell brand is very very strong right um I know it when I joined shell there is something about the shell brand that captivates the imagination we are we are the number one brand um in the energy sector um I think beyond that our ability to be able to offer careers that span the entire Energy System whether you are in gas or oil or tomorrow you're selling fuel retailing or working in lubricants or in chemicals or in research and Technology all of it is available well so now while I have applied for a job in Shell I'm now in the final interview uh I'm uh really uh very fortunate because I'm going to be interviewed by the big cheese and here you are what do you ask me to see whether I'm fit for Shell I think the number one thing is make sure that this is the right company for you are you are you committed to a future to be able to transform the energy system as this company is is trying to do that's one do your values fit with the company your ability everything you've learned is interesting for us we will form all the technical capabilities that are required to help you we will give you the commercial capabilities that's not what we're worried about it's culture fit and it's ability to be able to actually influence the direction of where this company goes and making sure that we fit you as much as you fit us now you um make people change jobs with frequent intervals is it every four years people are supposed to try out a new job and there's no set measure but four years is not atypical right so some people will do their job for eight years N9 years 10 years we just announced for example our head of Mobility is moving on having done that job for 10 years it really depends but four is is not atypical for a rotation so which I think is is really impressive just what do you achieve by that look there's pros and cons to it and that's why it's important to be very specific the beauty of of um moving people out every four years is you create opportunities to really learn and to grow and to experience different parts of the company and because we are a multi-energy company one of the biggest benefits is allowing people to understand the different parts of the shell Forest so that they can actually connect those parts together as they become more senior in the company I think it creates excitement for young staff um our retention rates are are are amongst the highest in the industry uh and so we know we're able to keep staff because they get motivated but for certain jobs you need tenure uh particular jobs that are uh connected let's say to external stakeholders where you need to be in the country and be known to the stakeholders certain jobs where corporate history is important such as for example in in research and development so there's there's different parts which we need to be able to to also manage moving on to leadership what is good leadership to you um I I I think it's it starts with having the appetite and the humility to learn because I I think one of the biggest dangers in this job as you get become more and more senior uh in most jobs actually is the conviction that you start to actually know stuff um that is that is a dangerous space to be the world around us is moving at an incredibly Fast Pace um now change is hard but it's also inevitable and therefore leaders need to be able to reflect that change both internally and externally and so to me the appetite to learn and the awareness to be able to then influence that ecosystem around which you are learning on a regular basis is a critical element of leadership I think another element is um I I recognized a few months into my job that you have a whole bunch of um assumptions which underly every view we have right I have 26 years in Shell uh that I've learn multiple things and that that forms my own thinking uh on the energy system and on what are the likely Technologies to evolve tomorrow or what will what will be unlikely to evolve one has to be careful that those assumptions do not lock one's head in and you become almost combative in saying no no my truth is the only truth that's one of the issues I see today in many of the discussions I have it's either my truth or your truth if you could implant a new skill set into your brain what would it be I'd love to be able to get a lot more understanding of um Fusion nuclear and where that is going u i I don't have a lot of background in that space so a lot of it is curiosity and and and I'm learning uh AI is another one that I've been spending quite some time on just you know reading books I just read the Mustafa Sal's the coming the coming wave it's intriguing because it's we're at the cusp of something that's going to fundamentally change not just the Energy System the entire world so I'd love to learn much faster than I'm currently learning don't we all now these are very big topics now how do you get this sense of purpose uh into your employees because intrinsic motivation is the most important driver for satisfaction and happiness and so on and um how do you install that into the company there's two elements I think one is making sure that the purpose of the company is Broad enough and Noble enough that people can connect to it but then secondly recognizing that each of us will have a different purpose biggest thing we can do is to have great team leaders because team leaders actually help our employees connect both to the company purpose but even more importantly help individuals find their own purpose I've had leaders who have helped me with that to say actually here's where the company wants to go but put that aside for a minute what do you want to do what is driving you is it is it your kids and what is it about what your kids are driving you towards what is it that you want to prove to them what is it that you want to prove to yourself and so we spend a lot of time building that cadra of team leadership and that's the number one metric that we we look for every single year when we do our overall shell people survey results it's how is the quality of our team leadership and where are interventions required to help those team leaders be better how do you react when people make mistakes I I think you have to embrace the learning around mistakes right I have to say I react much better at work because I'm conditioned to than at home when my son does something wrong I'm like come on we've talked about this before but I know that's wrong but is there not like a bit of temper in your your lebanes background isn't that quite a I get the actually headed type of actually it's the opposite when when you've when you've gone through a lot right so I've I've I've been I've had to sort of evacuate my wife and my son from you know reigning bombs when in 2006 uh we were Refugee in 1982 when we had to go through the Syrian border when you've had those experiences and somebody upsets you with a financial issue or the like life is there much bigger things than being worried about a mistake or the like you thank God every day for what you have and then you sort of say okay what can we do and that's what I like about our company by and large when something goes wrong everyone comes together to be able to actually solve the issue and that to me is a big re reason why I stayed in the company I mean this is a company I joined with the idea and want to get it on my CV learn a bit and leave within a year and 26 years 27 years later I'm still around how do you relax uh I love sports uh I'm an avid Sportsman I have three young boys uh so I'm having to work harder to be able to continue to compete with them as they grow older what kind do you what kind of things do you do play football uh soccer um I grew up loving soccer playing it we do tennis uh we are more and more now into paddle we do water sports um basketball whatever we can do any sport where we can get the competitive juices at amongst the four boys we're doing it do you have time to read I do have time to read um I do my daily reading I do my weekly reading so you know um Publications and the like and then I'll do my sort of books typically when I'm traveling I I go back to my favorite Khan's the prophet which whenever I'm going through a phase where I just why is that your um your favorite book um it's nice that he comes from a village that's not too too far away from where my mother uh grew up in Lebanon um but more specifically that book to me was one where it allowed me to sort of move away from self to actually society and my broader role within shaping Society um particularly when he I'm reflected for example now around my own kids where he uh in his book he talks about um your kids are not your kids they come through you and that that very powerful as my son starts to prepare to go to university how do you let him go now you've done what you can he's his own man now and you try to support him through that Journey so in those times of of reflection I think that book moves me from what is Hardcore numbers engineering back to philosophy and life which is which is not a bad idea and well um what is your best advice to your three sons and all the young people who listen to this podcast generally my my sons are I think sick and tired of hearing me say this it's how to make them the best version of themselves every single one of my sons is different actually it's shocking to me and my wife how different they are so my biggest job is how do I help each one of them be the best version of themselves I think what's great about what we can do is if you can have people who are truly special at a couple of things that's absolutely fine you'll be you have others who who will complement their skills but make sure that they are special at a few things and my biggest job is to help them find what those one or two things for each of the is well it seems like you are a very good version of well soan so big thanks for uh for being here uh really impressive thank you thank you very much niola thank you for having me
