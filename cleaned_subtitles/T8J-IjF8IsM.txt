The cost of buying a home in the United States 
has increased sharply in recent years. While  
prices have gone up, the more dramatic shift in 
affordability has come from mortgage rates. This  
change has created a wealth divide - between 
homeowners who locked in low rates in 2020 and  
2021 and those entering the market today.
Even a seemingly small increase in mortgage  
rates can sharply hike monthly payments. 
On a $400,000 loan, a jump from 3% to 7%  
increases the monthly payment from $1,686 dollars 
to $2,661. Buyers today, not only have to finance  
ninety thousand dollars more on average than 
those who bought five years ago, but they have  
to do it at more than twice the interest rate.
The result is a wealth divide between those  
with low interest rate mortgages – locked 
in for decades and those who bought more  
recently at higher prices and higher 
interest rates. According to Redfin,  
Americans have started staying in their homes 
much longer than ever before, with many staying  
put because it makes no financial sense to trade 
their low-rate mortgage for a much more expensive  
one – which would happen if they moved house.
We have seen bad consumer sentiment surveys for  
roughly two years now – with fears of unemployment 
and inflation expectations at levels last seen  
during the global financial crisis – meaning that 
Americans are quite worried about their financial  
futures. Household debt hit a record high 
this year – but despite all of this gloom, the  
American consumer appears to keep on spending.
Home Depot reported a 5% rise in net sales this  
quarter, even as the number of transactions fell 
to an eight-year low – it would seem that economic  
anxiety is best treated with a trip to Home 
Depot and a new patio set. Walmart warned about  
inflation this week but still raised its sales 
guidance for the year. American Express noted on  
an earnings call that “our card members may say 
they don’t have any confidence in the economy,  
but they still continue to spend.”
If homebuyers and borrowers are feeling  
squeezed, consumers are worried 
about inflation and job losses,  
and delinquencies on car loans and student debt 
are rising, why are Americans still spending?
 
One factor is this divide in housing costs 
where homeowners in identical properties,  
with similar incomes who bought maybe 
just a year apart from each other might  
have dramatically different payments.
A real estate agent I spoke with last year  
described buyers stretching to afford payments, 
banking on future rate cuts to refinance.  
It’s the financial equivalent of buying a 
yacht and hoping the marina fees go down over  
time. It’s quite worrying if the expectation 
that 30 year rates will definitely come down  
has become part of buyers expectations.
Another reason that consumer spending has  
been so strong in the United States, despite the 
higher interest rates is that the unemployment  
rate is very low today and it has been very 
low for a few years now. On top of that,  
asset prices are high, meaning that savers and 
investors have been seeing their wealth grow.  
 
65% of Americans own homes and 40% of American 
homeowners own their homes outright. So a big  
chunk of American homeowners don’t have 
to worry about interest rates at all. 
 
There was a huge boom in mortgage refinancings 
when interest rates were low, and during that  
period most existing homeowners – who had 
mortgages - refinanced and will be enjoying  
low financing costs for decades ¬to come.
If we make the reasonable assumption that long  
term homeowners incomes have been growing 
at the average rate of income growth in  
the United States - they will be spending 
less than 9% of their income on housing.  
On the other hand, those who bought in the last 
3 years find themselves spending about a quarter  
of their income on their mortgage payment. 
So, not only do we have the “haves and have  
nots” of renters versus homeowners, we also 
have the “haves and have nots” of those with  
low versus high-interest-rate mortgages.
The cost of housing is only part of the  
story - let’s look at how the mortgage 
divide is influencing consumer behavior,  
why regional housing markets are diverging, and 
how the lock-in effect is reshaping migration  
patterns in the United States. We’ll also 
explore how inequality among millennials  
is widening—sometimes more dramatically than the 
gap between millennials and boomers—and examine  
the strategies homeowners are using to think about 
their mortgages not just as debt, but as financial  
instruments. Before we dig into that, let me tell

The consumer balance sheet in the United States  
presents a bit of a mixed picture. On the surface, 
debt service ratios are quite low, and spending  
is strong. But when you dig a bit deeper, 
some signs of strain are starting to show.
 
Delinquencies in subprime auto loans have been 
rising steadily over the last three years,  
reaching a 15-year high this year. As of 
January, 6.6% of subprime borrowers were  
at least 60 days past due. This is the highest 
rate since Fitch began tracking the data in 1994.  
Unsecured credit card delinquencies have been 
rising too, with the sharpest increases among  
cards issued between 2021 and 2023. The financial 
pressure is concentrated among recent borrowers  
and lower-income households, whose balance sheets 
are more exposed to rate hikes and inflation.
 
On top of this, consumer spending has been 
distorted this year as consumers rushed out to  
buy durable goods before tariff price increases 
hit. According to Morgan Stanley, a lot of the  
growth in consumer spending in the first quarter 
likely reflected hasty buying ahead of expected  
inflation, especially among higher-income 
households. McKinsey’s survey found that 91%  
of consumers were aware that tariffs were coming, 
and many adjusted their spending habits—buying  
goods before price hikes hit store shelves.
One of the more interesting effects of the spike  
in mortgage rates, however, has been how they 
are influencing geographic mobility within the  
United States. Homeowners with low-interest-rate 
mortgages are extremely reluctant to move, even  
for better job opportunities. This behavior is 
reshaping migration patterns and contributing to  
regional imbalances in housing supply and demand.
The migration from northern states to the Sun  
Belt—which started long before the pandemic—has 
been disrupted by higher interest rates and the  
lock-in effect, leaving colder regions – 
in particular the North East with unusually  
tight inventories of homes available for 
sale. Meanwhile, Florida and Texas – the  
states people rushed to during the pandemic 
- are seeing some of the steepest inventory  
increases in the country, with several metro 
areas showing year-over-year price declines.
 
While homeowners (as a group) have seen their 
balance sheets improve as rates have gone up,  
renters have absorbed the full brunt of housing 
inflation – and not just in the United States.  
Across advanced economies, rents have 
been rising at their fastest sustained  
pace in decades—around 5% annually. 
According to the Federal Reserve, median  
monthly rents in the United States jumped 10% in 
2023 contributing to a surge in homelessness and  
widening the gap between renters and owners.
According to The Economist, in recent years  
American homeowners increased their spending 
on things like hobbies and eating out,  
by 25% in nominal terms, while renters 
increased their leisure spending by only 16%.
 
One of the biggest problems affecting 
affordability in the United States is  
that America’s housing market has been 
stuck in a supply shortfall for years.  
US homebuilders added 1.4 million new homes in 
2023, which was the highest number since 2007.  
But that was not enough to serve the 1.8 
million new households formed that year.
 
Builders in the United States have been struggling 
with rising material costs, labor shortages,  
and zoning restrictions that slow progress and 
inflate prices. The new tariffs can be expected to  
push construction material prices even higher and 
anti-immigration policies will reduce the number  
of skilled construction workers in the country - 
as when we look at the different sectors of the US  
economy, the sector with the highest percentage 
of foreign-born workers is construction.
 
On the other hand, Trump has promised 
to open up tracts of federal land for  
housing construction and to speed up permitting.
In the wake of the Liberation Day celebrations  
in April - single-family home starts fell 12% 
compared to a year earlier. This sudden drop was  
driven by Homebuilders nervousness over tariff 
volatility – as if they bought supplies when  
tariffs were high only to see them fall later 
– they would find themselves building homes  
with a higher cost basis than their competitors. 
There has been a lot of talk in recent years about  
institutional purchases of homes and how that is 
pricing out new buyers. According to The National  
Rental Home Council - large investors made 0.74 
percent of single-family home purchases in 2021,  
meaning that someone other than a large investor 
purchased 99.26 percent of single-family homes.  
According to data from Redfin - real estate 
investors have been cutting their purchases as  
higher interest rates ate into potential profits.
Despite the frequently cited negative effects of  
investor purchases of homes – research shows 
that large institutional investors typically  
buy homes in need of repair and upgrade 
them to rent them out. The homes bought  
by investors are not left unoccupied, so while 
they reduce the number of owner-occupied homes  
in a neighborhood – they increase the supply of 
homes available to renters who might otherwise  
not be able to afford to live in predominantly 
owner-occupied neighborhoods. Overall, the effects  
of investors on the housing market are mixed.
According to Redfin data - while large corporate  
buyers have pulled back from real estate 
investments, smaller firms and individual  
investors are still active buyers, particularly 
in the Southeast and Southwest. They say that  
these investors have a preference for investing 
in low-priced homes and condos, with starter homes  
making up 40% of investor purchases. 
One of the big trends in the housing  
market – which is frequently discussed - 
is the fact that one out of every three  
homes in the United States is owned by people 
over the age of 65. The percentage of retiree  
homeowners had stayed flat for decades but 
began to surge starting in 2012. This group  
are particularly concentrated as a percentage 
of homeowners in the Northeast where their  
tendency to age in place – rather than to move 
to retirement communities has grown over time.
 
This concentration of ownership among older 
generations has deepened the generational  
wealth divide. But increasingly, the sharper 
fault line is within generations themselves.
 
As John Burn-Murdoch explained in the Financial 
Times, while the average millennial in the U.S.  
had 30% less wealth than the average boomer by 
the age of 35, the wealthiest 10% of millennials  
are now 20% richer than the wealthiest 
10% of boomers were at the same age. 
 
In the UK, the top decile of thirty-somethings 
holds £300,000 in property wealth, nearly triple  
that of the wealthiest boomers at the same 
age. Much of this advantage is inherited:  
36% of young American homeowners received 
family financial help to buy their first home,  
and among UK recipients, the top 10% received 
£170,000, compared to an average gift of £25,000.
 
These transfers compound over time. A larger 
deposit not only lowers monthly payments but  
also reduces total interest paid—doubling the 
value of the original gift. As Burn-Murdoch notes,  
“home ownership in the US is becoming increasingly 
hereditary, just as it is in Britain.” The result  
is a growing divide between millennials with 
access to capital and those without—one that  
is increasingly visible, and increasingly bitter.
A home is often the largest investment a household  
will make, and the mortgage used to finance 
it becomes the most consequential financial  
product in their portfolio. Fixed-rate mortgages 
resemble bonds: their value shifts when interest  
rates change, even though the repayment schedule 
remains constant. Floating-rate mortgages behave  
more like corporate loans, adjusting in real 
time and maintaining a stable present value.  
These structures influence the composition of 
a household’s broader financial portfolio.
 
As the Economist noted in a recent article 
- a homeowner with a fixed-rate mortgage  
worth 20% of their savings and a classic 60/40 
stock-bond allocation is effectively holding a  
60/20 portfolio—the mortgage offsets their 
bond exposure. For first-time buyers with  
little savings, the leverage effect is even more 
pronounced. Their portfolios resemble those of  
hedge funds: heavily leveraged, long equities, 
and structurally short fixed-income assets.
 
The decision to repay early, then, hinges on 
opportunity cost. Historically, investing spare  
cash in equities has outperformed early repayment. 
A $1,000 repayment in 2005 would have saved $1,800  
in interest; the same amount invested in a 
global index fund yielded $6,500. With interest  
rates elevated and equity valuations high, the 
balance between risk and return is shifting.  
The Economist argues that households should 
think of their mortgage as an important part  
of their investment portfolio – rather than 
just thinking of their home as an investment.
 
In most parts of the world, 30-year fixed-rate 
mortgages are either extremely rare or entirely  
unavailable. British and European borrowers can 
usually only fix their mortgage rate for two or  
five years, exposing them to frequent refinancing 
risk and rate shocks. The expiration of ultra-low  
rates in Europe has already triggered a 
wave of rising mortgage bills. In China,  
the structure is different again: homeownership 
surged through state-led reforms in the 1990s,  
but the Chinese real estate market 
is now burdened by debt distress,  
unfinished developments, and falling prices. The 
Chinese model concentrated household wealth in  
real estate, often bought with massive leverage, 
and this is now undergoing a painful unwinding.
 
These contrasts reveal how deeply mortgage design 
influences broader financial behavior, wealth  
distribution, and economic resilience. America’s 
long-term fixed-rate mortgage offers stability—but  
also creates lock-in effects when interest rates 
rise and can amplify inequality based on when  
a homeowner financed their purchase. State-led 
housing booms can accelerate wealth accumulation  
to begin with, but also concentrate risk. The 
design of mortgage systems – to a certain extent  
- reflects national priorities—and determines 
how households build, preserve, or lose wealth.
 
Market chatter around Federal Reserve rate cuts 
has intensified, but the structure of the U.S.  
mortgage market limits how much relief home buyers 
can expect. Most 30-year mortgage rates are tied  
to long-term Treasury yields, which respond to 
inflation expectations and investor sentiment—not  
directly to short-term Fed moves. Even as the Fed 
signals caution, mortgage rates remain near 6.75%,  
and Redfin economists expect them to 
stay in that range through year-end.
 
Meanwhile, the housing market is shifting. There 
are now roughly half a million more sellers than  
buyers, and pending sales are down, but prices 
have not meaningfully declined. Sellers are  
adjusting slowly, with asking prices rising 2.2% 
year-over-year, the smallest increase in nearly  
two years – but still an increase. Buyers appear 
to hold more leverage, and many remain hesitant,  
backing out of deals or waiting for deeper 
price cuts that may not materialize.
 
This imbalance reflects deeper structural forces. 
Inflation remains sticky, especially in the U.S.,  
where fiscal expansion and tariff 
policies continue to push up costs.  
Mortgage-backed securities—most of which 
are government-guaranteed—anchor the system,  
but also tie it to broader macroeconomic risks. 
The result is a housing market caught between  
policy expectations and financial reality. For 
future buyers, the promise of lower rates may not  
translate into affordability. For policymakers, 
the challenge lies in aligning monetary  
tools with the realities of housing finance.
