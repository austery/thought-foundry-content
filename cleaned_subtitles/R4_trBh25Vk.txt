The Olympics has always served
as a touch point for me to reflect
on just how quickly our world changes.
Think about it.
Every four years,
the Summer Olympics
shine a massive spotlight
on how much our technology
evolves between the games.
So I want you to take a minute
and picture yourself in the year 2004.
Try to remember the world back then.
We didn't have iPhones,
The Facebook, as it was originally known,
was just emerging on college campuses
and YouTube?
It wasn't a thing.
I competed at the Athens
2004 Olympics in women's rowing,
which may as well have been
the ancient Olympics,
as far as technology goes.
I was still using a flip phone,
and I sent my friends and family
email updates from the games
using my Hotmail account
and dial-up internet.
(Laughter)
So now I want you to imagine
what it was like
to win the first US Olympic medal
in the event in 20 years.
And rather than getting to instantly
share that news with the world
via my Instagram or TikTok account,
my teammates and I had to wait to see
if the Olympic broadcasters
and journalists would cover it.
Our story was entirely
in their hands to tell or not.
Well, 20 years later,
and all of this has changed.
In an instant, we have sports scores,
match results and news stories
at our fingertips
and on our phones the moment it happens.
And this is incredible.
But there's still a problem.
It's one thing to seek out
the information you're looking for.
It's another thing entirely
to stumble upon it.
The stumbling upon it goes like this.
You're scrolling through
your social media feed,
you see something
that captures your attention,
you click on it and poof!
Down the rabbit hole you go.
You're locked in.
Well, this stumbling upon is what
we in marketing call discoverability.
And for sports, it's the magic
that fuels existing fans
and captures new ones, pulling them in.
But while it's easier than ever
to search for sports news on Instagram,
TikTok or Google,
the information that fans stumble upon,
or rather discover,
well, it's served up to us by algorithms.
They use historical data,
fan interactions, and what's trending.
Which mainly skews to men's sports.
Despite incredible talent,
heated rivalries and growing popularity,
women's sports remain largely
invisible in our daily content feeds.
And this has real-world implications.
I've spent nearly two decades
in global sports
and entertainment marketing
at IMG, at Visa and now at Google,
and I've seen firsthand
how and why this happens.
So I want to unpack this with you all.
I want you to think
about these technology platforms
as massive digital libraries
and the algorithms as the librarians.
They’re great at organizing,
indexing and cataloging information,
but here's the important bit.
They can only make recommendations
from what's on the shelves,
which historically,
for many decades and only
until very recently,
has been 19 stories about men's sports
for every one story about women's sports.
Nineteen to one.
So if I ask any of these
technology platforms,
who has scored the most goals
for their country
in international football,
who do you think I get?
Most of you are debating,
is it Cristiano Ronaldo?
Maybe Messi?
Well, as of recently, Cristiano Ronaldo
has scored 141 goals for Portugal.
But factually speaking,
this answer is wrong.
And spoiler alert, it's not Messi either.
The correct answer
to this gender-ambiguous query
is Christine Sinclair of Canada,
with 190 goals.
(Cheers and applause)
That's right.
This isn't just a mistake.
It's a symptom of a bigger problem.
And it's one example of many.
These gender-ambiguous queries
come down to word-matching issues
within the algorithms.
When sports journalists, commentators,
content creators
consistently publish content
that gender-qualifies women's sports,
but not men's,
we get an imperfect response.
For the person looking to settle
the Messi versus Ronaldo debate,
this answer works,
and for the majority of people
entering this query,
this is what they're looking for.
But the factual omission
of women in these answers
and in our daily content feeds,
well, it negatively impacts the athletes
who have worked very hard
for the distinction,
but also the fans who are looking
for this information.
This lack of visibility fuels what's often
referred to as the vicious cycle
of underinvestment.
The vicious cycle of underinvestment.
In 2023, for example,
president of FIFA Gianni Infantino
went on record criticizing many
of the traditional broadcast networks
for offering up to 100 times less
for the women's rights,
even as the 2023 World Cup
tournament approached half that
of the men's tournament.
The same thing's happening
here in the United States
with NCAA men's and women's basketball.
The men's tournament earns
1.1 billion dollars per year
in media rights fees,
17 times more than the estimated value
of the women's tournament,
even as the last three finals,
on average, are approaching par.
These costs, they don't just
undervalue women's sports,
they're undervaluing
the women's sports fan,
which is a huge miss
in the bigger economic picture.
It turns out, compared to men's sports,
fans of women's sports are younger,
they're generally more tech savvy,
and they're more loyal to brands
who sponsor women's sports.
But in a world where
men's sports are everywhere
and women's sports are harder to find,
these short-sighted media
rights holders and gatekeepers,
well, they're failing,
certainly the athletes,
but also the fan
and especially, and maybe
more importantly, our girls.
Which leads me to the real kicker.
Despite the recent surge
in women's sports,
our girls are still dropping out of sport
at twice the rate of boys
by the age of 14.
If they can't see incredible content
of female athletes
crushing it in sport and in life,
it makes it harder for them
to see sport as a pathway for themselves.
If they can't see it,
how can they ever dream of becoming it?
I know without a doubt,
I would not be the person
or leader I am today,
were it not for the lessons
I learned as an athlete.
The grit,
the determination, the teamwork,
the accountability, the resilience,
all of it has had a significant impact
on the rest of my life.
And this makes sense.
We know there's a direct correlation
between girls who grow up playing sports,
becoming women who lead.
But while 94 percent of C-suite women
grew up playing sports,
only six percent
of global CEOs are female.
Which means when girls drop out of sports,
a significant pipeline
for future female leadership suffers.
Now there is good news.
Women's sports are growing,
and it's thanks to the contributions
of new media players
that are reimagining the sports
landscape for women's sports.
Brands who understand the value
and are leaning in,
athletes,
fans who are working as content
creators behind the scenes.
And yes, even you and me.
Brands and media rights holders
who understand the value
of women's sports audiences,
they're leaning in and they're
reimagining traditional models
around sports rights.
Take Visa.
They became the first-ever
standalone sponsor
of UEFA women's football.
They worked with UEFA
to basically unbundle
the women's sponsorship rights
from what was traditionally sold
as a bundle with the men's.
Another interesting example this year
came from streaming platform Netflix,
who secured the exclusive rights
in the US and Canada
for the next two
FIFA Women's World Cups.
I'm proud to say that at Google,
we're tackling the bias
challenge from both sides.
We're getting smarter at responding
to your gender ambiguous queries
while at the same time working
with content teams like Arsenal,
Liverpool, women’s clubs,
making sure that across
India Women’s Cricket,
the WNBA, the National
Women's Soccer League,
we're creating more stories
for the algorithmic librarian
to catalog and recommend.
This is an example
of Liverpool Football Club.
Today, when you enter this
into the search query,
you're given the choice of do you want
the men's team or the women's team?
Our search products are getting better
at women's sports discoverability,
and at the same time,
we’re working with media partners
at ESPN, “The Athletic,”
even “British Vogue,”
increasing the coverage of women's sports.
Athletes and fans
are also playing a critical role
in reimagining new models.
They're building their own audiences
with social media,
creating brands that live
far beyond the field of play.
Take US rugby player Ilona Maher.
She blew up on social media
during the Tokyo 2020
and Paris 2024 Olympics
with her hilarious
behind-the-scenes glimpses
of athlete life in the Olympic Village.
She became her own media channel,
connecting with audiences
and making herself
and women's rugby more visible
and more relatable
than traditional media ever could.
Canadian creator and fan Logan Hackett,
aka “sportswithlogs,”
is another awesome example.
She breaks down complex plays,
rules and controversies,
making women's sports easier to understand
and more accessible to new fans.
More recently, I've been paying attention
to how AI is poised
to accelerate all of this.
While AI slop is a real thing,
in the right hands,
tools like Gemini and ChatGPT
can enable anyone to create thoughtful,
production-level, quality content
and distribute it at scale.
Take podcast host Sean Callanan,
whose “Sports Geek” rapid rundown podcast
uses AI to curate
the business news of the day
into daily episodes
on a variety of topics,
all in his own AI-generated voice.
He churns these out
with incredible speed and efficiency.
But the real impact?
That's going to come from all of us.
Your likes, your shares, your follows,
the athletes that you track,
the sports that you follow,
it all plays a significant role
in contributing to the library
of women's sports content.
My challenge to you is this:
Go futher.
Go beyond what the algorithm serves you.
Follow athletes that intrigue you.
Maybe try your hand at telling their story
as a content creator yourself,
even if on a small scale.
If you're a brand,
consider investing in women's sports media
or becoming a sponsor.
If you're a consumer,
buy brands who sponsor women's sports.
It all matters.
For too long, "you cannot be
what you cannot see"
has been a quiet barrier.
But what if we flip that from a warning
into a call to action?
Had I been able to instantly share
my proudest Olympic moments way back when,
I wonder what young athlete I would
have reached through the void,
and what boardroom
she might be sitting in today.
Leveling the playing field
for women's sports
is going to take all of us,
from brands, media rights holders,
athletes and fans, to you and me.
When we choose to reimagine
the future of women's sports,
we open the door to possibility.
Let's reimagine the future
of women's sports
not as something
we have to work hard to find,
but as something we deliberately
and collectively build to be seen.
Thank you.
