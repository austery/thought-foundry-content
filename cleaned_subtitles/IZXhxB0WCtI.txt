Philosophy is so refreshing, it makes you so happy
Each episode introduces you to a philosophical thinker
This week, July 4th is Independence Day in the United States
The founding of the United States was deeply inspired by Locke, the father of liberalism
In today’s video, we will introduce Locke’s political philosophy
Locke was born into a Puritan family in 1632
Received a good education since childhood
Learned classical knowledge at Westminster school, the best school in Britain at the time
Received a scholarship to Oxford University after graduation
But after enrolling, Locke discovered
What Oxford teaches are medieval knowledge systems
Instead, he preferred the most cutting-edge natural science and medical knowledge at that time.
He also became a student of the scientist Boyle
The same Boyle who taught "Boyle's Law" in high school chemistry class
So Locke was not actually a philosopher in the first place.
But scientists, physicians
Locke was later employed as a private physician in London
London is the political center of the UK
20 years living in London
He began to develop his own philosophical system
At that time, Britain was often at war with other European countries for many years.
To fight a war, the king needs to collect taxes and recruit troops.
Tax issue leads to conflict between king and parliament
Became a main reason for the Glorious Revolution in Britain
At that time, there were frequent incidents of plots to assassinate the king in England.
Locke was also implicated once
His name appears in the list of rebels
So he later went into exile in the Netherlands
During this period he wrote his treatise "Government"
This book argues: Why can some people rule over others?
Where does the legitimacy basis of rule come from?
Europeans used to believe in the divine right of kings
Will not question the legitimacy of the king
But after the decline of church power in Europe in the 17th century
people will start asking
Why do rulers rule us?
Let’s talk about this video in today’s episode
How does Locke answer this question?
Why do rulers rule the people?
Locke's answer is
Because the people agreed to let the government protect their property
So Locke first needs to demonstrate how private property emerged.
we can imagine
How did humans interact before there were governments?
This kind of thought experiment is called the state of nature in political philosophy.
For example, Aristotle believed
Some people are born unable to use reason
Born to be controlled
This kind of person is naturally destined to be a slave when he is born.
The state of nature itself is a state of inequality
Hobbes believed
The state of nature is barbaric anarchy
Everyone will compete for resources and go to war with each other
That's why a government is needed to maintain peace
But Locke believed
In the state of nature, everyone should be free and equal
Because Locke was a Puritan
He believed that God gave everyone equal rights to pursue self-preservation
God created nature, animals and plants for human consumption
Let people live
Otherwise, God might not have created these things.
Just let people starve to death
So self-preservation is a natural human right
If people want to protect themselves, they must work and accumulate property.
for Locke
Human nature is essentially an animal that acquires property
What is property?
Only what I can own is called property
The essence of property is to exclude others from use
How did property rights appear?
Locke proposed a
Labor Mixing
Argument
Suppose in a public orchard
Everyone can come and pick fruits
eat these fruits
You have to collect, clean and process the ingredients
This requires labor
When you use your own labor to transform natural raw materials
You are infusing your body's energy into nature
In other words, you contribute the value of your labor
So now this thing becomes the fruit of your labor
You have the right to say this is mine
Others cannot steal your work
This is the origin of private property
<font color=#FFE800FF>One for you, one for me</font> <font color=#FFE800FF>One for you
. One for me.</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>No, no, no, why did you take so much food? </font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>No, no. Why do you get so much food?</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>I caught the fish .</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>I caught the fish.</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>Yes
.</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF> I made the fire
.</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>Then? </font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>And?</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>I cooked
.</font>
<font color=#FFE800FF>I did all the work,
and everyone got something.</font>
This theory actually has a strong Christian flavor
Just like God created man
Therefore man is the property of God
Killing is illegal
Because killing is destroying God's property
But this theory also has limitations
What if someone mined all the resources in the world?
Do all resources become his property?
Locke said that first, we must leave enough resources for others.
Second, man cannot have more than he can use
“To store more than you can use is to rob others.”
Because the necessities of life will expire and become corrupt.
Let's say you produce a bunch of
But I can’t use it all
These things will be wasted
At this time, others have the right to enjoy your property
in order to make the best use of everything
in other words
The perishable nature of natural resources
In fact, humans are prohibited from accumulating excessive wealth.
So then humans invented money
Convert the value of items into money and save them
This change is very critical
Because in a period when money is not circulating
Even if you grab the land
As long as the harvest from the land cannot be converted into money
No matter how many crops you accumulate, they will eventually rot
It's like working in vain
People will have no more incentives to develop land
But when currency became popular
You don’t have to worry about natural items expiration and corruption
You can pay someone to do the work
Unlimited accumulated capital
This allowed the market economy to begin to develop
But it also gave rise to problems of economic inequality.
So the later philosopher CB Macpherson would say
Locke's theory of property is a doctrine that justifies capitalism
The unlimited development of capitalism and endless economic competition can be traced back to Locke
Locke's defense: development is not destruction
It's an improvement of the land
Because the resources on the earth were originally given to mankind by God
If everything is abandoned and no one develops it
That would be a waste of natural resources.
So when European colonists discovered the New World of America
see a lot of land undeveloped
Locke believed that this was the state of nature
No one owns that land
in fact
Much of the land was deliberately preserved from development by Native Americans.
But according to Locke's theory
land that has not been developed with labor
can't be claimed as your property
So many Aboriginal lands are considered terra nullius
The 200-year history of the western development of the United States is based on Locke’s philosophy.
The Puritans who immigrated to America worked hard to open up the land and cultivate the land.
Use agricultural productivity to prove that he is the owner of the land
This is used to rationalize the dispossession of indigenous peoples’ land.
Franklin, the founding father of the United States, mentioned in his autobiography:
"If it be the design of Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth "
Locke's theory was written into international law after the 18th century
Developed a principle called terra nullius (first possession)
Whoever discovers a new piece of land for development first can claim it as mine.
This accelerated the motivation of European countries to colonize overseas.
Leading to the "legal" plundering of indigenous lands
By the 19th century
The Ainu people in Japanese colonization of Hokkaido
When there were Taiwanese aborigines
It is also a "legal" colonization using the law of terra nullius.
ironnically
When Europeans came to America, Australia, and Oceania
brought infectious diseases
The aboriginal population in various places has been greatly reduced
So many places have really become terra nullius
Locke's theory became a self-fulfilling prophecy
To sum up
for Locke
Private property, market economy, land development
They are all products of the natural state
rather than a product of state power
It existed before government existed.
This is an important argument for liberalism
Later philosophers such as Rousseau and Marx would also challenge
Locke believed
It is precisely because of the emergence of property and money that
Economic inequality begins to emerge
Make people prone to disputes
trespass on other people's property
It takes creating a government to protect property rights
That is, from the state of nature to the political community
So next Locke will talk about the origin of government
before 17th century
It is generally believed that royal power originated from force
Or the divine right of kings
Like the Norman Dukes conquering England
It is to obtain domination by force
But now Locke says: Unless with the consent of the individual
Otherwise no power in the world can force me to obey a political authority
The legitimacy of rule can only come from the consent of the people
Because according to Locke's theory of property
Before the establishment of government
Private property exists
When property is violated
It takes a government to punish criminals
So the purpose of government
To protect life and private property
People elect political representatives by majority vote
majority rule democracy we have today
It was developed from Locke's philosophy.
But after the emergence of the government
Must be taxed to function
Locke's greatest fear
It means that the rulers use various methods to collect taxes from the people.
Because of the original purpose of establishing the government
It's to protect people's property
Not so that the government can take away people's property
So Locke said
The government cannot take people's property without consent
Even if it's only part of it.
Because you took part of it
You can just keep taking it
In the end all my property was gone
The government can only tax with the consent of the people
people here agree
It refers to the people's representatives in the Legislative Yuan who agree
Because when people elect their representatives
In fact, it means consenting to be dominated
Believe that these public representatives will protect their property
Therefore, the Legislative Yuan and legislative power are the most important
Because this is a government agency responsible for protecting property
This theory of government that Locke is talking about
In fact, it was the British Glorious Revolution at that time
The British Parliament successfully seized power and contained the royal power
We now live in a democratic society
It may sound like it's nothing
But in the 17th century
This is a very bold theory
Because Britain is a monarchy
Say that the legitimacy of rule comes from the consent of the ruled
It's like hinting
The legitimacy of the British king cannot be hereditary
but must come from the people
<font color=#FFED00FF>The king is not England.</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>The king is not England.</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>And England is not the King.</font> <font color=#FFED00FF>And England is not the King
.</font>
But if the rulers elected by the people
What should we do if we infringe on people's rights in turn?
For example, rulers can bribe public representatives
Let them pass bills that are in the interest of the rulers
Or the ruler may become a despot or tyrant
The definition of a tyrant is to rule according to one's own will
rather than governing the country according to law
Locke said that if this happens
It threatens the people's right to self-preservation
Undermining the people's trust in the Legislative Yuan
It is equivalent to launching a state of war against the people
Because the legitimacy of government rule is given by the people
If the rulers themselves do not abide by the law
Then it no longer has the right to rule
When people's natural rights are threatened
People have the right to revolution
You don't need to wait until the government really kills the people
to start a revolution
For example, the British launched the Glorious Revolution
It's because James II already showed signs of being a tyrant
It's like when a robber threatens your life on the road
You can't wait until the opponent actually attacks you before you fight back
Because you will already be dead by then
So Locke’s final conclusion in Treatise of Government is
Revolution is legitimate when the ruler becomes a tyrant
The United States was founded by overthrowing British colonial rule.
Therefore, Locke's political philosophy decisively influenced the founding thought of the United States.
Plato once said that in the Republic
You must be a philosopher and a ruler
Otherwise, the rulers need to learn philosophy
The founding fathers of the United States are examples of rulers learning philosophy
As Thomas Jefferson mentioned when drafting the Declaration of Independence:
"Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are inalienable rights endowed by the Creator."
Freedom and happiness here refer to the freedom to accumulate property and gain happiness.
In fact, it is a reference to Locke’s philosophy
James Madison in Federalist Papers No. 10
It is pointed out more clearly: The primary purpose of the government is to protect property
This is also a direct reference to Locke’s philosophy
It is precisely because the founding fathers of the United States chose Locke's philosophy as the basis for the founding of the country.
The United States has just moved towards highly developed liberalism and capitalism
Immigrants to the United States believe
As long as you work hard and accumulate wealth, you can achieve success
Even if capitalism creates wealth inequality
This inequality only reflects the value of each person's labor
So the government should protect the assets of capitalists
This is why liberal countries are so disgusted with taxes on the rich
Think it's stealing rich people's hard earned money
<font color=#FFED00FF>Our Rights come from nature and god, not from government.</font> <font color=#FFED00FF>Our Rights come from nature and god, not from government.</font>
But Locke had a bottom line on the inequality of capitalism.
We just can’t make it difficult for the people to live.
Because self-preservation is a natural right
like after the glorious revolution
Locke served as a consultant to the British Board of Trade
Responsible for amending the Poor Law
He suggested that the government should provide relief to the poor
At least every citizen must be able to afford basic living
So Locke's liberalism
It is not a completely laissez-faire market economy.
He will still ask the government to maintain minimum social welfare
Finally, let’s talk about the criticism of Locke by later philosophers
First of all, Locke’s political philosophy
It's actually a very innovative concept
Before Locke
Philosophers all believe that economics should serve politics
For example, in ancient Greece
Aristotle believed
Slavery was done so that Athenian citizens would not have to work
Have time to discuss politics
And politics is to build a good city-state
Let people practice a virtuous and good life
But for Locke
It should be the other way around
Politics must serve the economy
The purpose of government is to protect private property
as if to citizens
A good life is about making money and accumulating more property
This seemed strange to ancient Greek philosophers
Because making money should be something that only slaves have to worry about
Thinking about accumulating more wealth all day long
Don’t you regard people as very vulgar existences?
But Locke's 17th century
It happened to be the nascent period of capitalism
People's moral consciousness has changed
Believe that working hard and making a lot of money is a life goal worth pursuing
Therefore, the later liberal philosopher Bentham would also criticize Locke
Said that he turned the pursuit of wealth into the foundation of freedom and happiness
It seems that the only thing the government cares about is
Just to protect the property of the rich
No need to care about social welfare or the interests of the majority of the people
Next comes the criticism of property theory
Locke believed
The legitimacy of wealth comes from people's labor to transform nature
I gave my strength and talent
So of course the fruits of my labor belong to me.
So the capitalist can say
The company can only make profits by relying on its own entrepreneurial talents and investment abilities.
Then the capital should have received more profits.
So capitalist inequality is justified
Rawls, the later liberal philosopher, criticized
Locke's theory actually presupposes "self-ownership"
Thinking that a person’s innate intelligence and talents belong to him or her
But actually you are just lucky
Winning the genetic lottery
That’s why he is more talented
And your genes come from the gene pool of the entire human community.
It is an asset shared by the entire society
Your talents actually never belong to you
It's given to you by society's gene pool.
So people who are more talented and earn more
Should give back more to society
The government has the right to charge more taxes than the rich
This allows distributive justice to be achieved
Another criticism of Locke focuses on the "right of consent"
Locke said: No authority can rule over me without my own consent.
People who support capitalism will use this consent theory to argue that
Workers have no right to say they are being exploited or call for a strike
Because the moment the worker signs a contract with the boss
I have agreed to be ruled by this company.
Workers complain all day about low wages
But didn’t you apply for this job yourself?
It’s not like your boss is pointing a gun at you to force you to sign a contract
If you think your salary is low
Then you shouldn’t have come to this company in the first place.
So capitalism’s low wages
It is the result of the workers’ own consent
<font color=#FFED00FF>That's the miracle of the price system
.</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>That's the miracle of the price system
.</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>Because, note,
these thousands of people who have been led to engage in this simple transaction,</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>Not one of them has been forced to do it
.</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>Nobody
has had a gun to his head.</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>They all choose to do this, why? </font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>they've all done it. why?</font>
<font color=#FFED00FF>Because each one of them thinks he's better off in this transaction
.</font>
Marxist philosopher Gerald Allan Cohen criticized
Workers sign contracts with employers
Not because he really wants a job
They are forced to work to survive.
This is not free will consent
in capitalist society
Landowners and employers have inherited wealth from generations to generations
But workers inherit nothing
Because over the hundreds of years of capitalist development
Farmers in the past were deprived of their land
In Locke's time
People can also go to America to explore new lands by themselves
But nowadays
All the land on earth has been occupied and developed by landlords.
So workers actually have no choice
Just went to the company to apply for a job
This kind of consent is actually a kind of forced obedience
think about it
If there was a universal basic income today
You can make a living without working
Will you still agree to stay in your original company?
Finally, there is a criticism from a historical perspective
Historian Domenico Losurdo pointed out
When we read liberal philosophy
It cannot be understood using today’s concept of property
Because before the 20th century
liberalism's freedom to own property
In fact, it also means the freedom of owning slaves
<font color=#FFFB00FF>My solicitor has documentation verifying the negro known as Clemens Ray
is my property.</font>
<font color=#FFFB00FF>I know
nothing of this arrangement.</font>
<font color=#FFFB00FF>You are ordered to return that property immediately, or be charged with thievery
.</font>
At that time, there were frequent slave escapes in the United States.
So when liberals call on the government to protect people's property
There is actually a hint behind it
The government wants to send police to capture the slaves
To ensure that white people’s property does not escape
For example, Locke himself invested in the slave trade
is a shareholder of the Royal African Company
In 1682, when Locke was writing a Treatise of Government
He was invited to serve as secretary to the American colony of Carolina
Helped write slave laws
"Every Freedman of the Carolinas has absolute power
and authority over his negro slaves"
Here we see the contradictions of liberalism
In England, Locke was the father of representative democracy
Promote the legitimacy of rule from the consent of the ruled
But in the American colonies
Locke thought
White people could rule over black slaves without their consent
This actually violates Locke's own theory of consent
Because Locke believed
Only slaves acquired in just battles are legitimate
He is the one who takes the initiative to start a war
If you lose
The winner can give the opponent a choice
Leave the other person alive and make him a slave
If a prisoner of war is a voluntary slave
Such slaves are legal
But all black slaves in the United States were forcibly brought to the United States.
Locke also knows this very well
We can also think the other way around
If there hadn’t been the labor force of these black slaves,
Can liberalism flourish in Europe and the United States?
Because even if the Europeans exterminated the Native Americans and grabbed a lot of land
As long as there were no black slaves toiling on the plantations
It is impossible for the United States to accumulate large amounts of wealth
So the West can move towards modernization
Become a liberal power
The land invasion and slave trade behind it are key factors
While Europeans are shouting for freedom
It also created the lack of freedom for the people in the colonies.
In today's episode we introduce Locke's political philosophy
Locke is known as the father of liberalism
His government theory had a profound impact on the founding of the United States
His theory of property promoted the pioneering of the American West
Political authority derives from the consensus of the majority
It also made Locke the founder of the modern representative nation.
But when the West upholds the ideals of freedom and democracy,
often forget
Liberal philosophy also contributed to the unfreedom of the colonized people
Aboriginal lands were plundered
Economic development relied on black slaves
until today
When capitalist countries forcefully expropriate land
They all still use Locke’s arguments.
Said that this would help development and economic growth
So anyone who wants to understand today's liberalism
majority rule representative democracy
There is also the ideology of capitalism’s infinite pursuit of growth.
No one can avoid Locke’s thought
