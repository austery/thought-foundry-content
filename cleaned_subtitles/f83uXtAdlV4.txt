>> I'm Carol Master along with Isabelle Lee. Let's get to some stocks on the move. Bloomberg News equities reporter Natalyia Kiny Javich is here in studio and got to talk about the big banks. They were definitely moving. Some good, some bad. Yes, it it is an interesting earning season. So, let's start with Wells Fargo. The ticker is WFC. This is the best performer in the S&P 500. The stock is up by 7%. Of course, this came after the bank raised its key profitability metric known as target for return on tangible common equity to a range between 17 to 18% from a previous level of 15. Of course, it came after the Federal Reserve removed an asset cap in June because we know that Wells Fargo was restricted from expanding the size of its uh asset size. So now it is a big development. However, on the earning side itself, we saw that net interest income came below expectations. EPS and revenue were in line. And then another big bank we are watching is of course JP Morgan. Uh the ticker is JPM. The stock finished the trading session down by almost 2%. Couple highlights. Of course, we saw that the revenue was driven by investment banking fees. For me, it's specifically interesting because I cover the IPO market as well. We saw a recovery, but of course, highlights from CEO Jamie Diamond about softness in the economy, labor market. This is kind of a cockroach or a cockroach.

And of course, it came after announcement that the company will team up with open AI and enable shoppers to uh browse and uh buy products on chat GPT and of course it is a kind of big push. Analysts are pretty excited about that. they see quote significant opportunities. Specifically, UBS uh analysts are saying that and D8 division Davidson, excuse me, analysts is saying that it it is actually making the case for Walmart to be a winner among all traditional retailers in this kind of
>> like doesn't it beg the question like who's next? Do we now all of a sudden get a ton of buy buttons from everybody? Like I don't know.
>> Yes, you're right. I I this is something I didn't see coming actually. But if you think about it, it kind of makes sense. Like, yeah, of course, you want to have a AI to help you with whatever your shopping list is. And Matt earlier from TV made the case that he even uses Chatty for recipes.
>> He uses it for Yeah, he totally does. Tim does the same thing. Like, he'll be like, "Here's what's in my my fridge or something and so on and so forth. Like, what can I do with it?" I love it. I love playing with it. I've used it a little bit for work and stuff, but it's kind of fun.
>> Um, all right. There's a company I'm not familiar with, but it definitely was on the move today.
>> Yes, it is an interesting story. The company is called Atai Life Sciences. The ticker is ATI. The stock jumped by 11% today. This is a clinical trial stage uh biioharmaceutical company. It was among the biggest movers today in the pharmaceutical space across other uh uh psychedelic stocks. So the it came after uh after a Republican state senator in North Carolina said that the state could quote lead the nation in expanding military veterans access to mental health drugs because this company specifically develops uh treatments for mental health diseases. This is according to a report from a publication called Marijuana Moment. So we do see that these stocks are on the move today. Yeah. Yeah. And Nem initiated coverage of the company with a recommendation of buy and a price target of $12.
>> Yeah. Not a company.
