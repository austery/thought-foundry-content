People are worried about whether there's going to 
be an enduring relationship with China and Russia. 
If you look at this picture, the relations 
look more glacial than cordial and the little  
one's hauling on the arm of the big one. 
One wonders about that. It turns out my  
expertise is on Russo-Chinese relations.
That's what I studied in graduate school. 
My dissertation was a history of their border 
from the Opium Wars in the mid-19th century  
until Outer Mongolia was snatched 
from the Chinese sphere of influence  
and parked in the Russian sphere in the 1920s.
So it's fun to talk about this particular topic. 
Before I get going, I'm 
going to do some terminology. 
I'm going to use the word Russia to refer 
to the czarist, Soviet, and modern periods,  
the same way that you use France to describe 
its many monarchies and many republics. 
The Bolsheviks thought they were special, 
so they came up with special words for  
special people: Soviet, Soviet Union.
But it turns out they were temporary  
and Russia is the enduring thing. So that's it 
on terminology. Before I speculate on what the  
future is going to look like, our only database 
that we have is whatever happened from this  
second backwards, what people call history.
It's just whatever is in the past. That's it,  
that's our database. So I'm going to look at 
when Russia was strong and China was weak,  
from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th 
century, then the reversal of the power balance,  
and then in the recent period when 
China has been strong and Russia weak. 
China and Russia discovered each 
other late in their histories. 
It was the early part of their last 
dynasties when the Russians were after  
fur, very lucrative in those days.
That brings them out to the Pacific. 
But their relations are only episodic until we 
get to the mid-19th century, which is where my  
story's going to begin.
So in the 18th century,  
China was strong, Russia was weak.
But that doesn't last very long. 
Both empires followed the 
rules for continental empire. 
If you want to survive in a continental 
world— that's what both of them historically  
have been—you don't want to have two-front 
wars because you have multiple neighbors. 
Any one of them can come in at any time.
If they gang up on you, that's trouble. 
So you take on one at a time.
Also you don't want any great  
powers on the borders.
This is the fundamental  
problem with their relationship.
Today's friend can be tomorrow's  
foe. That is truly problematic. So 
what do you do to solve that problem? 
Well, you take on your neighbors sequentially.
You set them up to fail. 
You destabilize the rising, ingest the failing, 
and you set up buffer zones in between. 
You wait for the opportune moment to pounce 
and absorb. That is Vladimir Putin's game.  
But if you play this game, you're surrounding 
yourself with failing states, because you're  
either busy destabilizing them or ingesting them.
So the curious might ask, are Russia and China  
unlucky with all the very dysfunctional places 
that surround them, or are they complicit? 
Also, there are no enduring alliances in 
this world because the neighbors figure  
it out that the hegemonic power offers 
nothing but trouble in the long term. 
There's also no counsel on when to stop expanding. 
So both Russia and China are known 
for overextending, overdoing it. 
That may help explain some of their periodic 
implosions over their long and bloody histories.  
Very high mortality rates. Before you dismiss 
this paradigm, you've seen it operating in  
real time in Syria and Ukraine.
There are people who do this. 
It also explains why all 
those ancient ruins are ruins. 
This sort of warfare is ruinous.
But anyway, it lies at the basis of many  
of the great civilizations of Eurasia.
This is how they did things. 
I'm going to start my story in the mid-19th 
century, when the Chinese were beset by a whole  
series of rebellions that just about wrecked them.
The Russians take advantage of all of this. 
Remember the second rule of continental 
empires? No great power neighbors. The  
Russians repeatedly derail the rise of 
China by scripting the Chinese to do  
things that are remarkably detrimental to Chinese 
interests, but pretty good for Russian interests. 
It takes the Chinese a long time to figure it out.
They have governments coming and  
going in this period.
It's a difficult period,  
but they eventually figure it out by 
the time Mao reunifies China in 1949. 
So I'm going to go through each of those 
examples in turn, starting with a really  
big one, which is the Opium Wars.
This is when Britain and France are  
coming at China in order to force 
China to trade on their terms. 
This corresponds with the two biggest 
rebellions of China's period of rebellions,  
the Taiping and the Nian Rebellion. Here's a big 
chart. That's a simplified chart. The rebellions  
start in the late 18th century. Rebellion is a 
misnomer. These are civil wars. Either people  
are minority peoples who want out of the empire, 
they want to secede, or other people who want to  
overthrow the government in Beijing.
The peak period is in red. 
The really big ones are in white.
So China has got the two-front war problem. 
It's got Europeans coming 
at them, plus all of this. 
In fact, the Chinese have so many fronts, 
they don't know how to deal with it. 
The Russians come to the Chinese 
and say, "Hey, we can deal with the  
British and French for you and solve that problem.
You can deal with all the internal stuff. 
However, we need to have you sign a couple pieces 
of paper for us, the Treaty of Aigun of 1858 and  
the Treaty of Peking of 1860." What do they do? 
They cede to Russia large swaths of territory  
in Central Asia and the Pacific coastline.
The Qing Dynasty was vague on geography. 
They're beset by these other things.
They don't understand that Europeans  
think these pieces of paper are permanent things.
They figure that once they put their house back  
in order, they're going to come 
back and get the territory later. 
Okay, the second example of ruinous Russian 
mediation that is going to keep China in turmoil. 
So in the First Sino-Japanese War, Japan trounces 
China, boots them from their tributary in Korea. 
Then the Japanese also want some 
territory on the Liaodong Peninsula. 
The Chinese go to the Russians to help them 
counterbalance Japan so that Japan doesn't take  
this Chinese territory in the Asian mainland.
Russia gets its buddies, France and Germany,  
the so-called Triple 
Intervention, to gang up on Japan. 
Japan looks at three great powers and says, 
"I don't think so." So they bail. From the  
Chinese point of view, so far so good.
Except what the Russians promptly do is  
take for themselves the very territory 
that had just been denied to Japan. The  
story gets worse. All the European powers, or 
many of them plus Japan, come in and they carve  
out big concession areas throughout China.
So China's not going to have full sovereignty  
over its territory for several generations.
So instead of one relatively small Japanese  
concession area, they get foreigners everywhere.
Think about the second rule of continental  
empire, no great power neighbors.
That’s not happening while this is going on. 
The Bolsheviks come to power and then 
they're going to apply these rules as well. 
When they do come to power, they're very weak 
because Russia's been devastated by World War I. 
The Bolsheviks don't win their 
own bitter Civil War until 1922. 
So then as now, they relied on a really 
cheap but incredibly effective strategy  
of strategic communication.
The Russians really understand  
other people's emotional life and what 
sets them at odds with each other. 
They know just how to serve out the propaganda 
that sets people at each other's throats. 
Their propaganda is going to help the Chinese 
really despise the Japanese and the Europeans,  
while Russia's even greater predations, the ones 
you've already seen, go unnoticed. Here's Lev  
Karakhan. He was a deputy foreign minister.
In 1919, he sends a missive, his Karakhan  
Manifesto, to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
He says, "Hey, we're not imperialists,  
we're Bolsheviks.
We're gonna return all the  
lands from those unequal treaties and be your 
friend forevermore, unlike all the other evil  
imperialist powers. We're not like that anymore." 
The Chinese are looking at this and thinking,  
"Wow, here are the Bolsheviks who've gotten 
rid of their imperialistic government. 
They're putting together their shattered land."
So this offers hope to the Chinese  
that they can do likewise.
It's a model potentially to  
follow and a mentor who might help them. Except 
here's the detail. When the Bolsheviks started  
doing better in their civil war, they 
really dialed back what their offer was. 
The original offer was, "tear up treaties, China 
gets all territory back, no payments necessary." 
Under the new version of the Karakhan Manifesto, 
which the Russian Foreign Ministry goes and  
telegraphs to the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
I've seen the document, or at least a copy of  
it in the archives in Taiwan.
They send it back and say,  
"We're willing to talk about these things.
We're going to hold some negotiations." 
The facts are they didn't return these 
concessionaries until the mid-20th century,  
1950s, after the Westerners had returned 
almost all of their concession areas.  
This is not trivial. When we think of concession 
areas in the age of imperialism in China,  
you think of British ones: Hong Kong.
Well, Hong Kong isn't actually very big. 
The reason you know about Hong Kong is it 
makes lots of money, or at least it used  
to. The Russian concessionaries were huge. 
They didn't make money but what else is new? 
But the Russians had by far the largest 
concession area of any other country. 
But from the Karakhan Manifesto is the origin 
of the myth of Sino-Soviet friendship, that the  
Russians somehow treated the Chinese nicely.
And the Chinese Foreign Ministry officials,  
who would've known better, their 
government is overthrown within the decade. 
And presumably these documents 
just gather dust in the archives. 
My fourth example of derailing China's rise 
concerns the First United Front between the  
Chinese Nationalists and Chinese Communist Party.
Here's the leader of the Nationalist Party  
and also leader of its armies, 
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. 
He led the Northern Expedition, reunifying 
China at least nominally by either defeating  
or co-opting all those warlords.
There you can see different  
colors of where the major warlords were.
Previous South China attempts to do this or to  
secede from China, one or the other, had failed 
for lack of a proficient military. But Russia  
changes that. It provides aid, arms, and expertise 
and structures and things to fund the Whampoa  
Military Academy, which is in Canton/Guangzhou.
That institution is going to educate the officers,  
both Communist and Nationalists, 
who would lead not only this,  
but some of their civil war-era officers that 
make this reunification of China possible. 
But the Russians had a price.
Give the Nationalists the aid,  
but the Nationalists then have to let the 
Communists into the Nationalist Party. 
That's what the United Front is.
This all coincides with a bitter  
succession struggle in Russia.
This is the problem with dictatorships. 
They really don't do succession well.
It's why elections are so convenient. 
Instead you have Stalin and Trotsky going at it 
over which one was going to be the big cheese. 
Stalin is all about socialism in one country.
He thinks that Russia ought to focus  
on its own internal development.
Whereas Trotsky says, "Nonsense, we need  
to focus on world revolution because only if there 
are sister revolutions abroad can ours survive." 
While this is all going on, the Chinese Communists 
really want to get out of that United Front. Why?  
Because it puts them in close proximity to the 
army, which is controlled by the Nationalists. 
They're getting worried whether 
they're about to get killed. 
The Russians say "No, no, no, no, it's good.
You stay in that United Front." So they  
do. Chiang Kai-shek goes roaring up China. I've 
shown you the map. He reaches his home base in  
Shanghai, pauses, and he turns his guns on the 
Communists and just massacres them in droves. 
This is when Mao has to think of a 
rural strategy to power because the  
urban strategy is no longer feasible.
Once this happens, Stalin can use it to just  
trounce Trotsky in the internal power struggle 
because he can say, "Look, see, revolution  
in one country. It doesn't work abroad." A 
lot of Chinese died proving Stalin's point. 
Another example where Russia 
literally derails the rise of China. 
There's a railway system in 
Manchuria. We're going to talk rails.  
The Russo-Japanese War of 1904 and 1905, Japan 
wins it and gets from Russia, which built all  
these things in Chinese territory, the southern 
half of that railway net in lieu of an indemnity. 
Japan invests massively in railways, 
infrastructure, and apparently local politicians. 
But the ruling warlord apparently wasn't 
sufficiently attentive to Japanese needs,  
so they assassinated him in 1928.
His son, Zhang Xueliang, the following  
year in 1929 decides he wants his railways 
back from Russia. What does Russia do? It's  
not either version of the Karakhan Manifesto.
The Russians deploy over 100,000 troops, tanks,  
airplanes, the works, and just pound this 
man. The Russians keep their railways. So  
if you want to delay the rise of China, 
that sort of thing delays the rise of China. 
But now for the first rule of 
continental empire: no two-front wars. 
You move fast-forward to the 1930s and Stalin 
thinks he may very well face a two-front war with  
Germans in the west and Japanese in the east.
Why would he think such thoughts? The  
Anti-Comintern Pact. Comintern is 
short for Communist International. 
It is the Soviet outreach program.
It's signed in 1936 between  
the Japanese and the Germans.
Stalin goes, "Uh-oh, they're after me." 
He plays every one of his China 
cards and he holds lots of them. 
If you want to disintegrate the neighbors in 
order to delay their rise, well then you fund  
all sides of their civil wars and any side in 
between because you just want them to go at it. 
So he plays every card he's got.
What he wants are the Nationalists  
to stop fighting the Communists, vice 
versa, and unite to fight the Japanese. 
They're willing to do this provided Stalin 
provides conventional aid, which he does,  
but they think he's also going to provide 
soldiers. They don't get it. Once they're in,  
Russia is out of this thing.
Stalin's plan, his script for  
the Chinese and Japanese, works beautifully.
Because when the Nationalists unite in the Second  
United Front with the Communists, going back 
to the dark side, the Japanese are apoplectic. 
This is when they do the massive 
escalation in 1937 and they are  
off to overextension into 
parts due south of Russia. 
So this two-front Japanese-German 
war never materialized. 
Stalin was very successful, the Chinese 
less so because the Chinese are fighting  
the Japanese so the Russians don't have to.
That comes at the price of millions of deaths,  
millions of refugees, that does indeed derail 
China's rise yet again. Next example. Per the  
Yalta agreement, Russia finally gets 
into the war in Asia. About time.  
In the very final weeks, in this August Storm 
the Russians deploy 1.5 million soldiers. 
It's one of the largest military 
operations of World War II. They  
rapidly take Manchuria. That would be the 
normal thing, but here's the abnormal thing. 
They also take away Manchuria's industrial base.
That would not normally be what you do to someone. 
They take 83% of the electrical power equipment, 
take it home to Russia, not turning lights on in  
Manchuria. 86% of mining, 82% of cement 
making, 80% of metalworking equipment. 
Plus they take 640,000 Japanese POWs to be slave 
labor for decades, if they ever get home at all. 
And they also take the northern islands, 
which are still under dispute today. 
But if you think about it, if you're going to do 
indemnities or reparations or whatever this is,  
China had been fighting Japan in one 
form or another for 15 long years. 
Russia comes in for the cameo 
performance at the very end. 
So if there are indemnities to be paid for 
whatever Japan did in this war, surely China,  
not Russia, should have been the recipient for all 
this stuff. In addition, there’s another example.  
Not only does Stalin walk away with the 
industrial base, but he walks away with  
Mongolia as well. How does that work? The Yalta 
agreement also stipulates that the status quo  
shall be maintained in Mongolia.
So then you have to look at,  
well, what was the status quo?
It was the Russian sphere of influence in the  
north, Chinese continuing control in the south.
Mongolia, which had always been both those places,  
had been part of the Qing Empire, 
never been part of the Russian Empire. 
Moreover, Stalin had already 
taken Tannu Tuva in 1944. 
It looks small on this map, 
but it's bigger than England. 
It had lots of gold, which the 
Soviets had monetized long ago. 
So if you add up all the territory that the 
Russians took from the Chinese sphere of  
influence from the 1858 Treaty of Aigun and 1860 
Treaty of Peking, fast-forward to detaching Outer  
Mongolia from the Chinese sphere of influence. 
Here's what it really is. It's greater than all  
US territory east of the Mississippi.
This is not your normal land grab. 
So talk about derailing 
somebody, that would do it. 
To be fair to the Russians, they did, albeit 
slowly, turn over all this Japanese-stockpiled  
military equipment in Manchuria to the Communists.
They also, albeit belatedly, trained them on how  
to use the equipment and also how to 
run the Manchurian railway system. 
The Chinese Communists, as 
a rural peasant movement,  
how would they know how to do these things? They 
wouldn't. It allows this conventional aid and  
logistics of being able to move people around.
It transforms the Communists from a lightly  
armed guerrilla movement to a very heavily 
armed conventional force capable for the  
showdown phase of the Chinese Civil War.
So like the Whampoa Military Academy,  
this is essential aid for the Communist victory.
So neither the Communists or the  
Nationalists complain about the 
deindustrialization of Manchuria. 
The Communists probably traded that industry 
for all the conventional aid that they got. 
The Nationalists traded it and also Outer 
Mongolian independence for a promise from  
Stalin not to aid the Communists, 
a promise that he promptly breaks. 
So Mao starts to figure out 
that something is up here. 
So when he's on a roll in his offensives in 
the civil war, there's really bitter fighting. 
The real movement in the last phase, the post-1940 
phase of the Chinese Civil War, is in 1948. 
That year Mao just moves and 
he is roaring down south. 
He's about to get to the Yangtze 
River and Stalin's like, "Hey buddy,  
take a break at the Yangtze, don't exhaust 
yourself." Mao ignores it. Whereas Stalin  
might have wanted to keep a Nationalist 
rump state south of the Yangtze River,  
yielding a divided China in keeping 
with weakening your neighbor,  
Mao is not remotely interested in that.
Here's my 10th example, which is the Korean War. 
If you look at the Korean War, the 
first year is a war of movement. 
It’s up and down, up and down the peninsula.
It's unbelievable how much movement there is. 
But then it stalemates for the last two 
years and you think, "Well, what's going on? 
Why don't they settle the war sooner?"
Both sides are taking incredible losses. Well,  
here's how it goes. Once China intervenes in the 
Korean War and once they halt various offensives  
to start peace talks, the Chinese do incredible 
tunnel work, probably the North Koreans as well,  
and build an incredible tunnel system.
It means the South Koreans and the UN  
forces are never going to get anywhere 
near the Soviet border ever again. 
From that moment on, Stalin 
thinks he's got a low-risk,  
high-reward strategy where he's going to weaken 
the United States and delay the rise of China. 
So what's not to love about fighting 
to the last Chinese in Korea? 
Stalin thinks this is great and it's 
going to retard Chinese development. 
Also because China is so isolated by this war, 
it has no international friends but Russia,  
it's going to tie China to Russia ever 
more firmly and give Russia breathing  
space to rebuild after World War II while its 
Western enemies are wasting time in Korea. 
If you put it all together—Chinese Civil War, 
Korean War, Russia's on-and-off again aid to  
different sides in the civil war, his 
double-dealing with both of them and  
what happened with Outer Mongolia 
and the Manchurian industrial base,  
Stalin's advice to Mao to halt at the Yangtze, 
and then he's fighting to the last Chinese in  
Korea—this is all consistent with the second rule 
of continental empire: no great power neighbors. 
Once Stalin dies, finest day of his life, 
there's never as strong a leader in Russia again. 
By this time, Mao has figured out that 
the Russians don't want a strong China. 
He has to bide his time for a while, 
but he understands what is going on. 
Mao has a growing list of gripes.
It's not only that he didn't like  
Stalin's tributary treatment, but also Mao 
thinks, with his resume, that he should become  
the leader of international communism.
Stalin's successor,  
Nikita Khrushchev, is like, "No way."
Khrushchev does not remotely have Mao's resume. 
Mao has just put together a 
continent by reunifying China. 
That's not remotely what 
Khrushchev's ever been able to do. 
Mao also can't stand either 
Khrushchev's domestic or foreign policy. 
Domestically, Khrushchev is 
all about de-Stalinization. 
Mao doesn't like that, he's 
got a cult of personality. 
He doesn't want to do things like that.
Khrushchev is also interested in peaceful  
coexistence with the West, or at least 
nominally, whereas Mao is in the midst  
of the Cultural Revolution, which is based 
on a virulently anti-Western foreign policy. 
They're also forever squabbling about who's aiding 
North Vietnam in the Vietnam War and who's going  
to get credit for it. So all that's going on. Now, 
Khrushchev has his own gripes about the Chinese. 
He looks around at the United States.
The United States has got  
basing all over the world.
Its allies allow the United States to have bases. 
China has hardly any Russian bases, these 
leftover concession areas, and China wants  
them back. Khrushchev can't understand this. 
What he really can't understand are the two  
Taiwan Strait crises of 1954 and 1958, where Mao 
started lobbing ordnance on Nationalist islands  
that are very close to mainland shores.
Khrushchev is apoplectic because Mao  
hasn't given him any advance warning.
By the way, this sort of thing could trigger  
some of the security clauses of the Sino-Soviet 
Friendship Treaty with nuclear follow-on effects. 
Then while this is going on, Khrushchev 
wants to have a combined sub fleet base. 
If we're going to take all these risks, we need 
to have subs in different places. Mao says,  
"No way." Then Khrushchev has had enough 
and says, "Well, you're not going to get  
the plans for the atomic bomb."
The whole thing becomes public in  
1960 with anger all around.
The two, Russia and China,  
squabbled incessantly over the Vietnam War.
The North Vietnamese were interested in  
getting maximum aid from both, which it did.
They begged the Chinese to allow the Russians  
to ship things overland through China.
The Chinese felt obliged to do it,  
but the terms of that overland trade were 
just food for all kinds of squabbling. It  
just didn't end. So the story of the reversal 
in the balance of power between Russia and  
China arose from multiple factors.
It doesn't happen all at once. 
It is both a story of China's 
rise and of Russia's decline. 
Step one for China is getting its own 
atomic weapon, which it does in 1964,  
so that it can get itself free of Soviet bondage.
In 1964, after they detonated that bomb,  
Mao goes, "Okay, there are too many 
places occupied by the Soviet Union. 
The Russians took everything they could.
We have not yet presented an account  
for this list of stolen territory."
All the territory I've shown you,  
"We want it back." Russians' jaws drop, panic. The 
Chinese then are much more aggressive about what  
they consider to be their territorial rights.
There is a border war over territories,  
and in particular this one island, Zhenbao, 
or Damansky Island in the Amur River. 
Here's how riverine borders 
work, international ones. 
Under international law, the border is the 
thalweg, which is the center of the main  
channel of whatever the river is.
Russia had followed that with its  
European borders, not with China.
It claimed both banks of the Amur. 
The Chinese are fed up with that and they 
take Zhenbao Island and the Russians are  
furious and they come to the United States.
They say, "Would it be okay if we nuke these  
people?" We're like, "No." The Russians scratch 
their heads and they come back and they go, "Okay,  
would it be okay if we use conventional 
weapons to blow up their nuclear stuff?" 
We go, "No, still not okay." Mao gets it. The one 
that wants to nuke you is your primary adversary. 
So there's a reshuffling 
of the primary adversaries. 
Formerly the United States was the primary 
adversary of both China and Russia. 
That would be a reason for them to cooperate.
Now they're primary adversaries for each other. 
The United States can play the 
swing thing with all of this. 
For Russia it's really devastating having 
China as an enemy because it's going to  
have to deploy mechanized nuclear-armed 
troops all along its really long Chinese  
border, Central Asia, the works.
It's already doing this with its  
European borders and occupying Eastern Europe 
where the garrisoning costs are significant. 
Imagine if this country had to put those 
kinds of forces on our long Canadian and  
Mexican borders. It'd be bankrupting. Their 
economy was and remains a fraction of ours. 
But this breaking up of the earlier version of 
the bromance allows the United States to play the  
swing role. Then we cooperate. Both Nixon and Mao 
think ganging up on Russia would be a good thing,  
overextending Russia financially by overextending 
it militarily with all these armaments and things. 
In addition, what's going on as part 
of China's rise are internal reforms  
under Deng Xiaoping when he abandons 
certain communist principles of economic  
management and gets a much more productive 
agricultural sector and industry and commerce. 
So China's running double-digit 
growth rates for about 20 years  
with significant compounding effects.
That's the story of China's rise. 
Now for this dystopian alternate 
universe of Russian decline. 
Here on the left is Leonid Brezhnev, 
who apparently had a stroke in 1976  
that permanently impaired his thinking 
and whose death in 1982 finished him off. 
He was replaced by Yuri Andropov, whose own health 
was pretty parlous and he dies within two years. 
Then Konstantin Chernenko barely 
makes it a year before he's dead. 
It sort of sounds like us, but 
anyway it doesn't work well. 
If you look at Soviet growth statistics, they're 
really good right after the end of World War II.  
They're busy rebuilding. But when you get to the 
mid-'70s, they're going into terminal decline. 
When Gorbachev comes to power in 1985, Soviet 
growth rates have been 1–2% less than U.S. growth  
rates for the preceding decade.
The compounding effects  
of that are pretty horrendous.
In addition, there are other problems. 
Leonid Brezhnev was in power for 18 long 
years and not only did he collect cars,  
that was apparently the go-to gift for him, 
but in addition he was collecting a bunch of  
non-performing piles across the Third World 
because this is manifesting Russian power. 
But it's expensive and he doesn't 
have much of an economy to pay for it. 
If you look at oil prices, they're 
very much associated with the decline  
of the Soviet Union, rise of Vladimir Putin.
It's because in the Soviet era, government budgets  
relied as much as 55% on oil or energy revenues.
So piggy banks are going to shrink if oil prices  
aren't doing very well.
Gorbachev repeatedly said,  
"You know, we can't live this way anymore."
He wanted, and he did initiate political and  
economic reforms to try to save communism, 
except he really ruined the sclerotic patient  
doing what he did.
There are massive  
territorial implications for what he did.
It's the loss of empire in Eastern Europe  
and also the loss of the ethnically-based 
constituent republics of the Soviet Union. 
I'm going to show you Russia's 
territorial odyssey in maps. 
So this is 1938, before the Molotov-Ribbentrop 
Pact, the Nazi-Soviet Pact where they're dividing  
up Poland and parts of Eastern Europe – 
Nazis’ and Soviets – of what they want. 
This is before then, but by the time you 
get to the end of the war, Russia's got  
the Baltic states, it's got Kaliningrad, 
it's got all of Belarus, all of Ukraine. 
Then of course it gets Eastern Europe.
Gorbachev works his magic and you're  
down to Kaliningrad.
That's where Russians  
stage a lot of weapons nowadays, apparently dump 
a lot of toxic waste. That's what Kaliningrad's  
all about. So it was significant. At the 
end of 1991, when Russia's lost everything,  
they're down to a much diminished rump state.
That’s followed by years of instability in Russia. 
Russians agree that their country always has been, 
always should be, always will be a great power,  
but they don't measure it in wealth.
Their wealth has always been much less  
than their Western neighbors, although they 
often confiscate the wealth of other people. 
What they measure their strength, their 
greatness, is in vast territorial extent  
and the ability to run roughshod over others 
and make them do whatever it is Russia wants. 
Also when they look at their security, they 
also look at it this way. "We need this vast  
territorial extent to be secure."
But they never turn it around. 
They're always worried about other 
people invading them. "Do you suppose  
we pose a threat to anybody else?"
They never turn it around that way. 
Except Russia has posed existential 
threat to its neighbors forever. 
There are so many neighbors you have never 
heard of because they've disappeared from the  
pages of history, courtesy of the Russians.
Let's go to the medieval period where Russia  
starts out as the princely 
state of Muscovy, Moscow. 
Well, it wipes out the other princely 
states. There was Novgorod the Great.  
It was a more progressive place.
They wiped that place out, Rostov,  
there are a lot of other places.
Later they're eliminating the Khanates  
of Central Asia. These are states. It's 
a different way of organizing yourself. 
The Khanate of Crimea, Kazan, Astrakhan, Kokand, 
Khiva, Bukhara, they get rid of all of it. 
Then there's been this repeated vivisecting 
of European neighbors—Ukraine, Poland,  
Lithuania, Sweden and Finland—taking 
their territory one bite at a time. 
You can see it going on today.
The Russians just don't see that if you do  
this to other people… This is why at the end of 
the Cold War, everyone is stampeding into NATO. 
It's not some conspiracy, it's just 
what the Russians have done to them. 
Now I'm going to illustrate Poland's 
fate to show what happens when you're  
surrounded by rapacious continental empires.
Three partitions of Poland in the 18th century. 
This is when Prussia, Austria 
and Russia are taking things. 
The Russians say, "But we didn't take Polish 
territory." They're taking the Polish Empire.  
It's a technicality. If you wonder why Poles 
cannot stand Russians, it would be this. 
It would also be the genocide-laced 
occupation of Poland that went on for  
several generations after World War II.
Part of that, it’s Yalta again. 
The Russians insisted on moving 
Poland 200 kilometers to the west. 
That is not the normal thing to do to a country.
It's deep into German territory, so Russia can  
go eat a big part of Poland.
Then Russia decides it's going  
to cleanse the whole place, ethnically cleanse.
So Germans are going to live in Germany, Poles in  
Poland, Ukrainians going to live in Ukraine.
Millions of people—this is a war-devastated  
Europe where there's no way to take 
care of refugees—are being sent hither  
and yon, and lots of them are dying.
For the first time in their histories,  
Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary, Poland, Ukraine, 
they become ethnically homogeneous states. 
Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia 
require Russian troops to hang onto  
some of their current gains.
So a lot of things go on here. 
If you compare it to what the West is 
doing in the United States, the United  
States has a Marshall Plan, you've heard of it.
The United States is pouring aid into our Western  
allies to restore them after the war.
Well, this is what Russia's doing. 
They've won the war, so their troops are 
there, but they never take their troops  
home. Then they're busy running 
coups. Then they're busy shooting  
anyone who disagrees with them or they send them 
to labor camps, whatever they're going to do. 
Then they redistribute every 
form of wealth there is, either  
through nationalization or collectivization.
They're imposing this really non-functioning  
economic model on these people. It's called 
communism. It doesn't work. You wonder why Eastern  
Europeans aren't thrilled about a repeat of this. 
Well, come on. Moreover, the story gets better.  
The people who made all this 
happen include this charmer, some  
of the most toxic people from the Soviet Union.
Andrey Vyshinsky goes to Romania, lucky Romanians. 
He was running the show trials 
that were sending the original  
Bolshevik leaders to summary execution.
What does he do when he gets to Romania? 
He appoints the Ministers of 
Justice, War and Interior. 
If you do that, you control 
the courts, army and police. 
You can start expropriating 
everything and nationalizing things. 
You can start eliminating other parties.
You make Romania trade only with the Soviet Union. 
Another toxic personality, 
Marshal Kliment Voroshilov. 
He's another part of the A-list purge 
team. What had he done? He signed loads  
of execution warrants to his military colleagues, 
officers, during the Great Purges. What a great  
guy. He's in Hungary, lucky people. He's 
not quite as competent as the other one. 
In the elections of 1945 in Hungary, 
the Smallholders Party wins. Oops,  
they aren't Communists. He doesn't 
ever make that mistake again. 
Then he's busily appointing Communist ministers 
to different ministries, the land reform, taking  
over the civil service, getting the propaganda up 
and running, taking over youth and women's groups  
to infiltrate that way, and arresting all sorts of 
non-Communist politicians before he holds the 1947  
elections, which of course the Communists win.
Afterwards there's a really big purge where  
10% of the population faces tribunals. Think 
of that. Of this room, 10% of you are going  
to tribunals because Russians are in town.
Russia had a template for bloc building. 
I'm giving the details because you get a sense 
of how a continental empire runs business. 
The Russians looked at how when Italy 
surrendered to the Western Allies,  
they basically just ran the show in Italy.
So the Russians are going, "Well, we're going to,  
when we accept surrenders, run 
the show in Eastern Europe." 
But the Russians want to take advantage 
of the absolute turmoil that wars cause. 
Wars also often lead to war economies 
where you've got a lot of centralized  
government control to run the war effort.
So the Russians want to leverage that one. 
Then they've got this big Red Army presence.
They want to use all of those things, which they  
do. Here's their template. They're controlling 
the power ministries. What are they? Defense  
and Interior. If you do that, you're going to 
monopolize coercion and eliminate your opposition. 
If you control the Justice and Information 
ministries, you can arrest or kill at will. 
Then you control all the stories 
that are never told about this. 
If you control Agriculture, particularly in those 
days, you're going to buy a lot of allegiance  
by redistributing other people's lands.
That's going to wipe out class enemies,  
collaborators, all sorts of 
people you don't like, and the  
original elite that have been running rural areas.
They also had a story that they told about this.  
It's the big lie. Remember communism? What are 
the really bad people in the communist story of  
how we all live? It's the imperialists, 
right? Imperialism is really bad. Well,  
I've just shown you. Russians were the greatest 
practitioners of imperialism of the 20th century. 
They're doing this right as Western 
imperialists are giving up their colonies. 
Yet there’s this big lie, the big fiction that 
the Russians are somehow nice guys. They're  
using democratic forms. They don't eliminate 
Poland as a state, as the czars had done. 
It’s still called Poland, but it's a fiction 
that it's independent. It's not. There's a  
fiction that they hold elections, but they're not 
democratic. We already know the outcome. It's a  
dictatorship in reality. They're just purging the 
place. They're killing lots of Eastern Europeans. 
If you think Eastern Europeans don't 
remember this, they most certainly do. 
Then there is a more regional 
template for how you do this. 
I've already talked about ethnic cleansing. 
They did that. Then they tried moving countries,  
Poland to the west, Mongolia, I haven't talked 
about it, it was to the east in Chinese territory. 
Then they want to take some 
stepping stones for later expansion. 
That's what Kaliningrad is all about. Another one 
is Moldova. That is territory between Romania and  
Russia on very important river systems.
Moldova's got problems with a place  
called Transnistria, which the Russians have 
poached. That story's still ongoing. Also,  
places like Azerbaijan. It’s split between 
Iran and…well now its independent Azerbaijan,  
but it was split with the Soviet Union.
Then there are the divided states  
of Germany, Korea, Mongolia, and China.
You want all your neighbors quarreling over their  
borders so that Russia can then set the terms and 
that it can nibble them away a bite at a time,  
or if it can take a whole thing, good for them.
So Russian national identity is not  
only about empire, territorial extent.
It also has some big ideas attached to it, an  
ideology that somehow this territorial expansion 
is either progressive, beneficial or positive.  
It's a myth. Under the czars, the ideology was 
this Third Rome, of the Russian Orthodox Church. 
The Third Rome was in Moscow.
I know this is news to you. I'll  
explain how it works. There's the Rome we 
all know about, the "Rome" Rome. That was  
Rome number one. The one where the Pope is.
Rome number two, according to the Russians,  
has to do with the Byzantine Empire. That was 
Constantinople, or Istanbul. When that falls,  
the Russians go, "Ta-da, it's Moscow."
Not really, but they used this Russian  
Orthodoxy and spread the Russian Orthodox 
Church back in the day deep into Eastern Europe. 
When the Communists get in, they're not spreading 
Russian Orthodoxy, they're spreading communism. 
The problem for Putin is that 
today neither communism nor  
Russian Orthodoxy are marketable ideologies.
He's just stuck with being a really big place. 
That's where his little focus is. Russia has a 
nightmare scenario. They don't always win these  
wars. They lose quite often. The Mongol yoke or 
the Yellow Peril, their terminology, not mine,  
is the 13th century when the Mongols just swept in 
and the Russian elites became tax collectors for  
the Mongols, an extractive role that has endured.
You think about Russians, they extract resources,  
their own, other peoples, but they're 
not known for producing wealth. It's  
just resource extraction. This is 
some of the legacy of all of that. 
The Russians have also suffered devastating 
defeats, to Napoleon, in World War I and World  
War II, that just devastated Western Russia. 
So they've had bad times. In our own time,  
Putin is dumping all of his ordnance on Ukraine, 
leaving Siberia wide open to China's ambitions. 
So if he keeps the game up, he may 
well wind up with a Chinese yoke,  
and his nightmare will be there for him.
The Chinese also have their own big ideas,  
not religious ideas or empire, 
but about civilization itself. 
Traditionally, the Chinese believe 
there's only one civilization,  
that would be theirs. It's based on Confucianism. 
That would be a world order unto itself. 
That worked for them for a couple thousand years.
There are certain pillars of legitimacy that have  
endured, probably originating from this, but 
enduring ones. One is ethical rule. Well,  
that's gone for the Communist Party. Let's 
try the next one. Economic prosperity. Whoops,  
going fast. That leaves the Communists 
today with territorial expansion. 
That's ongoing with territory incursions 
into India, South China Sea island building,  
and then all these gathering threats to Taiwan.
In part, what's going on is that the Communist  
Party wants to play the nationalism 
card the same way Putin is. 
If you haven't got anything else for you, play 
jingoistic nationalism, because we human beings  
seem to be particularly attentive to that one.
So if you focus on that, maybe the Chinese  
people won't look at the ethical lapses of the 
Communist Party or the fact that their paychecks  
aren't going anywhere anymore.
Good old Xi, he doesn't  
have a marketable ideology anymore.
What's really scary is that Confucianism had  
just been this enduring feature of China—dynasties 
came and went, but Confucianism stayed—until  
China was unable to fend off Japan in the First 
Sino-Japanese War that I told you about and the  
Europeans in the Opium Wars, when all of a sudden 
Confucianism just seemed totally inadequate. 
When enough Chinese cease believing 
in Confucianism, that's when you get  
the 1911 Revolution and it just vanishes as an 
organizing principle for running your government.  
This is the total nightmare. One of the 
frightening things for the Communist Party is  
when people cease believing in communism.
China's nightmare scenario is  
these horrible periods of chaos.
They're afraid that if the Communists go,  
that China's going to devolve into these 
civil wars, these periods of Luàn (乱). 
A second one is that maybe the Soviet Union when 
it's shattered, that may well be their fate, that  
maybe these communist regimes can't last forever.
So Russia's nightmare scenario is other  
people invading Russia.
China's nightmare scenario  
is the collapse of China.
It's two different ways,  
two different things to worry about. The Chinese 
face a conundrum. If you no longer believe the  
economic theories on which communism is 
based, how do you justify one-party rule? 
The Communist Party has tried to 
soldier on without solving that problem. 
The Chinese have learned a great 
deal from watching Russians as  
they play around with big ideas.
They learned a great deal from Mikhail  
Gorbachev when he tries to fix communism, 
but he winds up killing the patient. 
The Chinese, I think, their 
takeaways from what Gorbachev did  
is don't hesitate to deploy the tanks.
If you've got unrest in the streets,  
you just send tanks, tanks against civilians. 
It's a really quick fix. You want to focus  
on economic reforms to the extent you 
can, certainly not political reforms. 
You also really want to sinify your minorities. 
Why? In the Soviet Union, the Russians had had  
this fiction that all these occupied minority 
people wanted to be there and had equal rights. 
So they would sponsor all the nice folk dances 
and the language classes, and they'd have a  
bunch of token minorities in traditional 
dress and various political institutions. 
But basically they had no power.
It meant when the Soviet Union shattered,  
there were plausible divisions 
already set up on an ethnic basis. 
That is how you get places like Uzbekistan, 
Tajikistan, et cetera. China's like,  
"No way." This helps explain the genocide 
of the Uyghurs that's ongoing now. 
This is their rationale for doing it.
Then what you want to do, you can  
see Xi Jinping doing it, is prioritize 
maintaining the monopoly of the Chinese  
Communist Party over economic efficiency 
when those two things run at cross purposes. 
That helps explain some of Xi Jinping's 
growth-depressing choices that he's making. 
Gorbachev discovered when he tried 
to reform communism that democracy  
and communism just don't mix.
If you give people elections,  
they're going to support multiple parties.
When the communist track record  
becomes known—their incompetent economic 
management, summary executions, famines,  
just all the things that they've been up 
to—it's very hard for them to remain in power. 
Also, as Gorbachev discovered, 
democracy and empire don't mix. 
When you give different minorities 
a choice, or occupied places a  
choice to leave or stay, they bolt.
There's a consensus among the Han,  
the preponderant ethnic group in China, 
that they want to maintain the empire. 
So they don't care how many 
Tibetans immolate themselves. 
That's no longer going on now because 
the mortar has descended into Tibet. 
They don't care how many Mongols 
complain about lost lands. 
The Han want to keep it.
Also for the generation that  
survived the Cultural Revolution, which would be 
Xi Jinping, he's precisely that age group, they  
do not ever want to go back to the chaos of the 
Cultural Revolution. It was horrendous. So expect  
them to prioritize stability over liberty. This 
brings a third problem. Democracy and communism  
don't mix and democracy and empire don't mix.
In an Internet cell phone age, where people  
are much more interconnected, how does a 
government maintain legitimacy to rule? 
Because elections are an incredibly powerful 
way to give authority to a government. 
This is where nationalism comes in.
The Chinese Communist Party and the  
Russians likewise are trying to use jingoistic 
nationalism to stoke up popular loyalties,  
to deflect people from domestic problems 
and go, "Look at the hated outsiders." 
They aren't the only country to do 
this sort of thing, blaming outsiders. 
It's all the immigrants' fault or whatever.
The problem with all of this,  
when the Chinese did it in 1980, right after the 
Tiananmen massacre, the Chinese Communist Party  
decided to rewrite all the textbooks.
So they're no longer going to focus  
on class enemies, but they're going to be 
focused on using jingoistic nationalism. 
They're going to focus on the evil Japanese, 
evil Americans, and focus things that way. 
Well, the problem with nationalism 
is it's a very heady drink. 
If you imbibe too much, it clouds the judgment.
Moreover, it repels minority people within China's  
empire who are not interested in Han nationalism.
It frightens neighbors to coordinate with each  
other and find big powers 
to counterbalance this mess. 
It also impedes the de-escalation of 
unforeseen international dust-ups or crises. 
With Putin's latest adventures, one 
would assume that the Chinese have  
some real thoughts about what's going on now.
In Putin's case, he has thrown away the Soviet  
addendum to the rules for continental empire. 
What was that one? No hot wars. If you think  
about Soviet rulers, they were all veterans 
of World War II through Leonid Brezhnev. 
They understood that war is easy to get 
into, hard to get out of, very unpredictable. 
For them it was proxy wars.
They loved it when the  
United States got into hot wars.
What is not to like about the Korean War and  
the Vietnam War with the United States just tied 
down and Americans tearing each other's eyes out  
about these things? Great, great, great. Russians 
stayed out of it until after Brezhnev's stroke. 
That's when they make the 
big boo-boo in Afghanistan. 
They go into Afghanistan and then all of a sudden 
we have loads of fun giving Stinger missiles to  
the other side, inflicting costs on the Russians.
The person who wanted to get into Afghanistan is  
Yuri Andropov, who was not a veteran.
The uniformed military of Russia said,  
"Don't go into Afghanistan."
Andropov and friends ignored  
it and did their thing.
If you look at Putin,  
he has risen to power on a diet of hot wars.
He comes to power in the early phase of the  
Second Chechen War, where he levels the Chechen 
capital of Grozny and leaves most of the rest of  
Chechnya an environmental waste zone.
But he sorts that one out. 
Then he gets quite popular for his war with 
Georgia in 2008, where he detaches South  
Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia.
Now he wants to build a naval base  
in Abkhazia because he's having 
trouble with his base in Crimea. 
Then when he eliminates term limits for himself 
in 2012, which isn't very popular in Russia,  
he solves that by going into Ukraine in 2014 and 
walks off with about 7% of Ukrainian territory at  
very little cost. And Russians think that's great! 
If you look at these little stepping stones,  
this is the way continentalists look at it.
You’ve got all these little places lined up. 
You want to color it in.
That's where Ukraine comes in, in 2022. 
Putin wants to reverse all 
these territorial losses. 
He wants the green things and the purple things.
I don't know if he wants to do the Napoleonic  
Wars and go all the way to Paris. 
Who knows? Here's how he looks at  
NATO or doesn't look at it.
You look at when people join. 
There are two great big 
periods of accession to NATO. 
One is in the early Cold War with all the smaller 
countries of Europe, which is everybody. We're all  
smaller than Russia. The Europeans join to 
protect themselves from Soviet imperialism. 
Then at the end of the Cold War, when these Soviet 
satellites can finally slip the leash, I've given  
you all the reasons why, they stampede into NATO.
It is not NATO tricking them to join. 
They're stampeding in for excellent 
reasons. They've been proven right.  
Putin, when he works his magic the second time 
around in Ukraine in 2022, this is when the  
Finns and the Swedes decide neutrality's not 
going to cut it and they’ve got to join NATO. 
But when Putin looks at this, he goes, 
"Oh, they're coming at us in arcs." Well,  
this is ludicrous. Russia has posed an 
existential threat to these places forever. 
No one today wants to invade 
Russia. Who'd want it? It's full  
of Russians. We want them to stay home.
There's no one there who wants Russia. 
The Russians like to gaslight everybody else, 
like, "You're the problem." It's been very  
effective. Lots of Americans will talk about NATO 
expansion and say, "Oh, this is why Putin went to  
Ukraine. You did NATO expansion." He's gaslighting 
everybody. Russians are the problem. Also it  
is their totally dysfunctional domestic system 
that offers everybody else nothing but problems. 
Instead of focusing on that and fixing 
it so they can be a productive member  
of the rest of the world, they're not 
doing that. They're just invading other  
people. Back to the real problem, what are 
the prospects of a bromance with these two? 
Barring World War III, which would be the great 
powers going at it… If the great powers go at it,  
you might well superglue these two.
If that happens, whatever side is losing  
might well use a nuclear weapon, and then 
we're going to have toxic plumes everywhere. 
So we had better get our diplomacy right 
because there are really serious consequences  
for getting it wrong in this particular era.
We're at the beginning of a second Cold War  
with a leadership that has not been 
chastened by surviving World War I,  
the Great Depression, and World War II.
Which were the grownups who did a very effective  
job dealing with the early first Cold War.
We haven't got those people anymore. 
So if you look at primary adversaries, primary 
theaters, you don't want them to align for your  
enemies, because if they do, they'll coordinate.
Currently, Vlad the Bad has a Ukraine fixation. 
Xi Jinping has got a Taiwan 
fixation, opposite ends of Eurasia. 
Xi Jinping is also causing India problems 
and doing South China Sea island building. 
But they're on opposite ends of their two empires.
So far, nothing aligns with these two. 
Even in a world war, their primary theaters 
probably would not align in the same way that  
the Axis primary theaters did not align.
They might well disperse their resources  
in different directions.
But the problem is we have  
a lot of people with nuclear weapons now.
You really don't want to do the hot war. 
If the West and others manage things 
correctly, I've given you a huge  
historical legacy of fraught relations.
Play your cards appropriately and these  
two will take care of each other.
The rest of us can, if we do it right,  
not launch trade wars on each other, but 
rather try to maximize our prosperity  
so that we get stronger and stronger while 
they're busy in these wealth-destroying wars. 
Putin is just blowing through all of 
his assets in Ukraine to no purpose. 
That's how we fought and won the last Cold War.
Putin, he's trying to do empire in the age of  
nationalism. It's a non-starter. He's 
dumping all of his ordnance on Ukraine,  
leaving Siberia wide open.
Xi Jinping has moved right  
in even before the Ukraine war.
The Belt and Road Initiative  
is peeling away the former Russian 
sphere of influence in Central Asia. 
Putin is doing this hot war gambit 
when Russia's weak and China is strong,  
making it particularly damaging. Why would it 
matter? Siberia has precisely the resources that  
China now needs and covets and wants to have them 
contiguous so other people can't mess with them. 
In particular they want water because they've 
blown through their water table in North China. 
Lake Baikal has over 20% of the 
world's surface fresh water. 
So if you want a quick fix, it's the best one.
China is known for big water projects. 
They've been damming the Mekong and the 
Yangtze. They've done massive water projects. So  
that may be in Russia's future. Who knows? 
Xi Jinping now holds all of the cards. 
China has nine times the population, nine times 
the GNP of Russia, and their per capita GNPs are  
converging. Not good news for Putin. The question 
isn't whether this bromance is going to last  
forever, but rather when it's going to end.
When is Xi Jinping going to decide he's  
got the right amount of leverage 
to get whatever it is he wants? 
What's going on now illustrates the perils 
of getting your primary adversary wrong. 
Nicholas II fought a recreational war against 
Japan, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905. 
He is pouring resources into really 
an irrelevant theater in those days,  
instead of taking those resources and putting 
it into a railway system that European Russia  
desperately needed to face off Germany, 
which it does within the decade and loses. 
He is overthrown in part 
because of bread riots in St. 
Petersburg, because no foreign aid can get 
in, because he has inadequate railway system. 
They'll be built later and 
it'll be good for Lend-Lease. 
So he and his family wind up 
shot in a Siberian basement. 
It takes a decade to play out.
I don't know how it's going to go  
for Vladimir Putin on all of this.
If we play our cards right,  
maybe he'll go down as lonesome.
We may have to wait a long time. 
On the other hand, if we get into a hot 
war, nuclear war, and in the meantime,  
if the United States kills off its alliance system 
which is one of its greatest strengths, by doing a  
gratuitous trade war on our allies, then we have a 
dust-up with China… Well, let's think about this. 
Japan tried this go-it-alone, 
my-way-or-the-highway strategy  
with China back in World War II, when China 
was a failed state, and it wrecked Japan. 
China now has a population that's a 
multiple of ours, an industrial base  
that's a multiple of ours.
Why on earth would you  
ever want to take them on alone?
So I'm going to quote Pericles, who was  
the leader of Athens at its height when it was 
building all these ancient ruins that weren't  
ruins when they were being built. They're 
gone. This warning came on the eve of the  
succession of Athenian blunders and ancient 
Athens never recovered: "I am more afraid  
of our own blunders than of the enemy's devices."
Our leaders truly need to ponder this before they  
wreck all of us, themselves included.
So thank you for your attention. 
That's what I have to say 
about Sino-Soviet things. 
First question, I want to understand the 
role of ideology in the Sino-Soviet split. 
These are the two major 
communist countries in the world. 
They have this big ideological, 
world-changing mission. 
We're going to spread communism around the world.
That isn't enough to prevent war over,  
in the case of 1969, literally just 
some islands in the middle of a river. 
There's nothing super consequential at stake here.
Why didn't the fact that they were both these  
communist countries do more 
to cement the relationship? 
I gave you all these bad things that Russia 
had done to China, which are not small things. 
Then isn't the problem with communism that 
the economics of it don't actually work? 
Fundamentally these two countries are continental 
powers, they're continental empires. Sure they  
change out ideologies. The ideology of the tsars 
changes out to communism and China is changing  
out Confucianism for communism.
But the principle that each one  
should be king of the roost hasn't changed.
That would be a mutually exclusive proposition of  
who's going to run Asia and then Eurasia, because 
they have a shared address, this long border. 
Also with communism, it's supposed 
to take over the whole world. 
We're supposed to have a classless society.
That's why we don't even worry about governments  
and things because they're eventually going to 
melt away. Well, that's all nonsense. As things  
go on further and further, you have dictators more 
and more entrenched and they're using communism. 
There's another piece where it's 
just amazing, about the big lie. 
I don't know whether it was Stalin who 
said it, that if the lie is big enough,  
people will believe you.
It's just so out there,  
it's so preposterous, they go with it.
Which is this notion that it's the  
West through these imperial powers, right?
And we buy this, that they're not the ones. 
But if you look at it, I've given you the data.
Then this other one in our own time,  
this lie about, "Oh, it's the West, it's 
NATO expansion, this explains Putin." 
I’ve given you the data, it's nonsense.
Now why the Russians feel obliged to take  
other people's territory, part of it 
is feeling good while other people  
squirm. There's that aspect. They're not the 
only people who do those sorts of things. 
But it's also from being on the plains 
of Eurasia where, throughout history,  
people have invaded you.
So you have an established  
paradigm of how you deal with other people 
that is deep-seated over thousands of years. 
I can't totally answer the question 
because there are a lot of Russians  
and a lot of Chinese whose decisions 
together aggregate to what they do. 
I want to understand Stalin's decisions 
in particular in the case of telling the  
Communists during the Chinese Civil War that they 
can't go below the Yangtze River, so that he can  
split up the Chinese, the Communists and the 
Nationalists in China, and leave China weak. 
We know from all the actions in Stalin's 
life that he was a devoted communist. 
He does collectivization and almost destroys 
his regime because he's a devoted communist. 
At the same time, communism says that there has 
to be this worldwide revolution at some point. 
If there is a worldwide revolution, there 
will be other powerful communist countries. 
That's implied in the nature of what 
a worldwide communist revolution is. 
But at the same time he doesn't seem communist 
enough to want China to become fully communist. 
He cares more about real geopolitik.
Tell me about how this works. 
His version of communism, 
the Russians invented it. 
Actually they didn't, Marx invented it.
But they are the guys who think, "Well, we  
operationalized it so we should run it forever."
So of course Russia is going to be  
the big communist country.
A bunch of Chinese upstarts,  
from their point of view, are claiming, 
"No, no, no, we're going to run the show." 
But did Stalin as a communist think, "Okay at some 
point the whole world is going to be communist." 
He thought that he personally 
would be managing the whole world? 
Unclear. It's a long horizon. In his lifetime 
he's initially about communism in one country,  
then communism on your borders, 
which is what he's working on. 
As for the rest of the world, it takes 
Brezhnev to start going all deep into Africa. 
Stalin wasn't interested in, say, India because he 
thought they're a bunch of lackeys of the British. 
How do they let themselves be colonized by 
the British? There's something wrong with  
them. You have to also think about 
where history is at a given moment. 
He dies in '53, not that long after World War II.
How is it all going to turn out? 
His relationship with China, as far as he's 
concerned, is going swimmingly when he's in power. 
Mao goes there and kowtows in Moscow 
and does what Stalin wants him to do. 
That's Stalin's experience until he, 
I don't know, chokes on his Cheerios  
or whatever happened to him that morning.
If Stalin hadn't died, do you think a Sino-Soviet  
split was still inevitable?
Yes, there wouldn't have  
been Khrushchev's secret speech.
Obviously Stalin wouldn't have condemned  
the cult of personality.
But the grievances  
you mentioned would still exist.
I think the grievances would still exist. 
Dictators' deaths profoundly weaken their 
systems because they've got no good succession. 
It means you're guaranteed 
a cat-fight royale going on. 
That's what one waits for with Putin.
Eventually the man will die one way or  
another, and there will be a cat-fight 
royale for what happens after him. 
Stalin was pretty old when he died and 
Russians in those days had a lousy diet. 
I can't remember if he smoked. His generation 
mostly did. So I don't know how the future would  
have run with good old Uncle Joe there for longer.
The Korean War would have still gone on longer. 
It's really his death, why that war ends then.
With the Korean War going on and on, I don't  
know what the implications are for us or for Mao.
This is a really interesting thing to consider  
from this lecture.
In retrospect,  
maybe one of the most important things, if not 
the most important thing that happened in the  
20th century, is the Chinese Civil War.
At the time, you wouldn't think of this  
as a major event, especially since 
World War II had just happened. 
If you were living in 1948 or 1949, 
you wouldn't think of this as the  
main thing happening in the world.
But given that we know in retrospect  
this is a really big country with a huge 
population, we should be paying a lot of  
attention to its internal political development.
I wonder if we should apply the same logic today  
where there are other countries with huge 
populations where we don't think a lot about  
what's happening. India or Nigeria. 
I really couldn't tell you the first  
thing about Nigeria even though I know that 
it's a big country with a huge population. 
Let's not try because I don't 
know anything about it either. 
On China and the Chinese Civil War, there was 
an understanding that it was a really big deal. 
That's why Roosevelt—and the British 
are just thinking he's laughable—keeps  
trying to treat China like a great power.
The British are saying, "They're not a  
great power, Franklin, not remotely."
But he wants to bring them into the  
Cairo Conference.
He also wants them to be a  
veto-wielding member of the United Nations, which 
by China's military status there's just no way. 
But Roosevelt is looking, there's 
no Japan out there, we want to have  
something in Asia to counterbalance.
But then when you get to the Chinese  
Civil War, Americans who've fought some 
big wars, they're looking at it saying,  
"It is not feasible for us to alter this outcome."
The thinking was — I think it was the Eisenhower  
archives — that if they lived together long 
enough, they would go at each other eventually. 
I want to zoom in on one particular episode 
during this period that I think is fascinating. 
In 1936, the Communists in China kidnapped Chiang 
Kai-shek, who's the leader of the Nationalists,  
and they're about to kill him.
Stalin radios in over the Comintern. 
He says, "No, you can't kill Chiang 
Kai-shek even though he's your enemy,  
he's been massacring you. You gotta let him go." 
In exchange, Chiang Kai-shek has to promise to  
create a united front against the Japanese.
There are 30,000 communist guerrillas  
when they're fighting the Japanese at this period 
and there are 1.5–2 million nationalist troops. 
The communists get to claim 
the prestige of fighting the  
Japanese with a fraction of the effort.
This just seems like a brilliant move on  
Stalin's part in retrospect, because if they 
had killed Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist  
forces might have dissolved.
There would be a puppet  
government installed by Japan.
It would be a terrible thing for Stalin. 
It just seems like Stalin makes a lot of right 
calls in the theater in Asia at this time. 
What is the understanding, 
big picture, that lets him? 
There are dictators all over the world 
who stay in power for a long time. 
Do not dismiss their ability to stay in power.
They're surfing quite a wave wherever they live,  
of people who butcher each 
other with great regularity. 
I would suspect—suspect, because how would I 
have the evidence—that many of these long-term  
dictators have EQs that are off the charts.
When you come in the room, they just gut-feeling  
know whether they're going to cap you or not.
If they get a few extra people, so what? 
Just so they get rid of all the people who 
are going to cause them problems. Incredible  
abilities. Also what Stalin does—I think Saddam 
Hussein imitated him, but I could be wrong  
about that one—is have multiple security 
agencies with overlapping jurisdictions. 
No one quite knows who's running 
the show and who's in power,  
but they're all funneling information to Stalin.
So he has better information than anybody else. 
You can use one one day, another another 
day, which explains how all the heads of  
the equivalent of the KGB come and go.
Most of the early heads of that wind  
up getting shot by their successors.
You'd think they'd notice a pattern. 
They're very good at staying in power.
They're really good at managing that  
problem. It does not bring prosperity. 
That comes from the world of maritime  
trade, of following international law 
instead of capping your trade partner. 
You're not going to get a second 
trade deal if you do that. 
It's just so much more wealth-creating, this 
alternate universe, but that's not where  
these continentalists are.
There's still something  
a little under-explained about…
Probably lots of things are under-explained. 
Hitler's another dictator. Forget 
about having these moves like deciding,  
"Don't kill this kidnapped person because 
it'll be a bad idea in the long run." 
On the opposite end, he's declaring war 
against America even when he doesn't have to. 
He's just making these crazy moves.
Stalin is a special thing to explain.  
It's not just communism. It's something else 
that's making him a deft geopolitical actor. 
You can do this in retrospect and go, "crazy 
move," because no one realized that the US  
productive base could do what it did. Americans 
didn't even know. You tell me right now how  
the future's going to turn out.
This is where if you flip it… 
When you look at history, you think 
it had to turn out that way because  
you can reverse-engineer something, at least a 
plausible story of why you wind up where you did. 
It may not even be the right story, 
but it yields the correct answer. 
So you think you got it.
But if you look at the future,  
how's this thing going to end with Xi Jinping 
and Putin? We don't know. Afterwards, you'll go,  
"Oh, something is profoundly stupid based on 
subsequent events." But we don't know now.  
There's a Russian proverb which is: Чужа́я душа́ 
– потёмки (chuzhaya uma potyomki). Someone else's  
mind, potyomki, darkness. You ultimately 
don't know what other people are thinking. 
You make your guesses, but then they do things.
When you showed the maps of China in 1850,  
Russia also in 1850, especially 1900, Russia 
and China are still big countries today. 
But if you just look at Qing dynasty 
China, it's overwhelmingly big. 
It’s the same with Tsarist Russia 
before the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. 
It makes you think that at various points 
through history, at most points through history,  
China was technologically dominant over 
the West, except during this one crucial  
period in the 18th and 19th century with 
the Industrial Revolution in high gear. 
Which changes the whole world.
Right. It reinforces the idea of  
how important it is to be at the technological 
frontier, especially at historically crux-y times. 
Of course we're in San Francisco.
Many of us here believe that this is especially  
a crux-y time in the development of technology.
Maybe we should continue investing in it instead  
of canceling all the science research projects.
What will be the long term effects of doing this? 
You're thinking of America's great 
strengths, its alliance systems. 
Our great strength also used to be 
being at the head of innovation. 
We're going to eliminate those things 
and think it's going to go well for us? 
I want to ask about your, I don’t know if you 
call it a prediction but, your hypothesis that  
at some point China and Russia will finish 
each other off or have some sort of conflict  
which will be bad for both of them.
They won't finish each other off. 
They're too big to be finished off.
Unless we do a nuclear war, then we  
might finish all of ourselves off.
But the idea that there will be some  
sort of conflict between these two 
countries… I agree with the idea that  
China has a lot of people and a lot of wealth.
Russia has a lot of water, and it has a lot of  
resources. These are complementary resources. 
They both have things that the other party has. 
The question is, will they attain these 
things through war or through trade? 
It seems very improbable to me 
that… China's got a lot of money. 
It can just pay for Russian 
oil, it can just pay for water. 
Why would it invade a nuclear-armed nation?
I never said it would do that. 
It's a question of if Putin feels that his 
back is up against the wall. What price? We  
don't really know the terms of their trade.
What are the real energy prices that China's  
paying for all of this? I don’t know. Maybe 
some people do know. I suspect that whatever  
the terms of trade are going to be, the 
Chinese are going to get a really good deal. 
If you look at what happened to Gorbachev 
at the very end of the Cold War. 
He's not going to war with anyone, but his 
internal situation is devolving so rapidly  
because their economy collapses.
He's already got lousy oil prices. 
In addition, he has so upset the centralized 
planning system such that revenues are just  
collapsing around him, and he's 
about to be thrown out of power. 
He is desperate for the kind of loans that 
the Germans in particular are willing to  
give him in order to get, not only Germany 
reunited, but West Germany staying in NATO. 
The next thing is East Germany is going to be 
in NATO too, and then NATO can have whomever. 
Those things are trades he never would 
have made ever, but he's so desperate. 
In that case, the West likes to pay people, 
so instead of paying him a low price,  
the West is paying him a high price to back off.
In China, I suspect it'll be the opposite. 
They pay him less and less for whatever it is he  
wants if he really continues 
to corner himself in Ukraine. 
These terms of trade will get 
more and more in China's favor. 
Does that look like the bromance ending?
North Korea has for decades been in a  
very desperate position.
That’s quite a bromance. 
But there's no risk of North 
Korea and China going to war. 
North Korea relies heavily on China.
It's not draining China in any way. 
It's the other way around. That's 
what Russia's future may be. 
Apparently certain Russians, when Putin had 
invaded the big way in Ukraine, said, "Oh my God,  
that's our future. It's North Korea. That's where 
we're headed." That could well be their future. 
It'll just keep going as they pour out 
wealth and the Chinese will try to get  
very good terms of trade for resources and be 
niggardly, meaning giving very few things back. 
In 1931, when Japan attacks Manchuria, Japan 
commandeers the Chinese Eastern Railway,  
which the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905 said 
was supposed to be under Russia's purview. 
People in the Politburo are telling Stalin, 
"Look, we’ve got to be aggressive against this." 
Stalin says, "Look, I don't want to raise 
tensions against another great power. 
Let's just let this slide, 
let's keep tensions low." 
This is quite similar to what happened with 
splitting up Poland in 1939 and then Barbarossa,  
where in both theaters he makes this 
calculation, "I'm going to let certain  
things slide so that I don't have to face 
off against these great powers on my border. 
I don't want to go to war with them."
In the case of Japan, it works because Japan  
decides to attack China and not Russia.
In the case of Germany, it doesn't. 
Yeah, in Germany, he's trying 
to run the same script. 
He thinks it's going to work for him.
That's what the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is about.  
Not remotely. He needed to read Mein Kampf to 
understand, "No, you're a menu item for Hitler. 
He's eventually going to come around."
In our own day we don't really  
want to absorb the bad news.
I could be wrong, but I believe that  
Putin wants not only all of Ukraine, which he says 
he wants, but also he wants the Baltic states and  
he wants to keep on going. This is profoundly 
bad news. If that's the case, then it means  
for Europeans at least, they're going to have to 
divert all kinds of resources to this problem,  
which is something they don't want to do.
Because like us, they're indebted too,  
and there are other things they 
would prefer to spend their money on. 
We don't like the bad news 
that this is where we're at. 
You have to make nasty trade-offs.
Stalin tries to work the same magic and thinks  
it's going to work for him and he doesn't get it.
He becomes the menu item for Hitler  
and it just about wrecks him.
But it works beautifully against Japan. 
It's just interesting to see. It makes 
sense why he thought it would work. 
When he's getting information that the Germans are 
lining up millions of men along this huge border,  
he says, "This is British disinformation."
He uses the exact same logic when  
Japan is invading Manchuria, that the idea that 
he had to fight Japan was British disinformation. 
Even though it was a mistake, it helps 
us understand why he thought this way. 
There's another concept that's useful: 
cooperative adversary. I've introduced  
this before. It doesn't mean the adversary 
wants to cooperate with you, but they just  
don't play their cards particularly well.
We're talking about China that has had all  
of those rebellions I told you about 
and civil wars and regional wars. 
It doesn't have these strong 
government institutions. 
It is much easier to script-write a place 
like that, to have them do things that are  
antithetical to their interests. You’ve got 
a cooperative adversary. The Chinese aren't  
trying to cooperate, but from a Russian point 
of view they might be a cooperative adversary. 
Whereas with Hitler, Germany has 
all kinds of institutions and  
all kinds of well-educated people.
Hoodwinking Hitler is going to be  
much more difficult than whoever he's 
dealing with in China in this period. 
An interesting connection to make between World 
War II and this Russo-Chinese relationship is  
that the way that we used Russia—as this reservoir 
of military men that we can just ship armaments  
to and they can do the dying for us—that’s similar 
to how Russia uses China in the war against Japan. 
Well, they're not actually during 
that war shipping that much to China,  
but at least during the Korean War.
Korean War, yes. 
Interestingly, Russia is doing to 
them the kind of alliance that we  
had with Russia during World War II.
Think about today. It's like the Korean  
War in reverse because China's dribbling out aid 
to Russia. Russia's getting wrecked by Ukraine.  
Russia's got three times the population or 
something of Ukraine, but the death rate that  
it's suffering is really high. These are only 
children. This is no longer the 10 children,  
six children, peasant families in Russia.
Look at it from Xi Jinping’s perspective, the  
longer this goes on, the better.
Just let Putin keep on working his  
magic and I get to sell him stuff.
I'll get him to lower the prices of  
resources because the man's desperate.
Putin will find himself under a  
Chinese yoke that he does not like.
Then at some point the Russians will  
reassess and I don't think they'll like that.
The Russians fancy themselves being Europeans  
and have a whole, I believe, racist 
package that goes with the Chinese so  
that they won't like that whole situation.
I don't know how long it takes them to  
do whatever they're going to do.
A lot of things in foreign policy,  
you're not going to solve it.
They're huge countries,  
there's no way you're going to solve it.
But you need to figure out how to manage it,  
to have a blast shield so that whatever fallout 
comes from their toxic, whatever they're doing, it  
minimizes how it hits your friends and partners.
This is why you should be focusing on maximizing  
the economic growth of your friends 
and partners, because that is the  
only effective way to deal with them.
If you go it alone, who deals with a  
bully alone? Always gang up on them. Why would 
you ever want to go alone against a bully? 
You'd want to go in with lots of friends.
This is what the World War II generation did. 
The Marshall Plan, you could never get 
something through like Congress now. 
Yet it's passed overwhelmingly in Congress 
because people get it that you have to spend  
real money so the European economies recover.
How are they gonna do it? Buying our stuff. It's  
a tremendous win-win. In strategy, you wanna 
figure out win-win things instead of these  
zero-sum things where, "Oh, I invite you over, 
I humiliate you, I feel good," and then you're  
mad forever. It's pointless.
Great note to close on. 
Don't humiliate people. Be 
kind to each other, yes. 
It's a good callback because I've been asking 
you all these naive questions and you've  
been very kind to not humiliate me.
Thank you all very much for coming. 
It is so fun to be able to do 
these things with a live audience  
and not trapped inside a dark studio room.
I hope we see you guys again on Friday  
when we're doing the lecture on the 
proper way to do war termination. 
And next Tuesday is about why Russia lost the 
Cold War. See you on Friday. Thank you, Sarah.
