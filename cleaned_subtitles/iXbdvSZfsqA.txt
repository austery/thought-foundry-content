[Music] hi everybody today we're going for an exciting drive with the CEO of Porsche and Volkswagen olivo Bloom now Porsche is one of the most recognized brands on the planet and we own more than 1% of Porsche and Volkswagen when Porsche got listed in 2022 we were a Cornerstone investor so we are kind of in the race together here so yeah hello it's a great pleasure to be together with you and joining your podcast serious Nikolai so um OE are you are you a petrol head I am I am I'm working in the automotive industry since 30 years I'm passionate for cars and I love it to drive when did you buy your first Porche I buy my first Porsche when I started at Porsche um almost uh 12 years ago and um it was the 911 what's the magic week 911 I mean uh your ticket code on the so exchange is p911 you have 900 111 million shares in issue so what what is it with this number yeah the 9911 is is our icon our first edition we launched in 1963 and since then uh we had um numerous um successes and victories in in Motorsport and uh the 911 expresses what what Porche stands for it's a unique design um it's a great performance uh of the car and it's the Great lifestyle of of Porsche our customers love M so you real professional petrol head you basically you open the door of a of a car and you sit down and you start the engine how do you know it's a good car so when you drive you start to drive you know second third fourth gear uh just how how do you know that you love this car what is it you're looking for yeah for first of all we have the key on the left hand side at at Porsche and then I know that I'm at home and feeling the car for for me is um how is the drivability of of a car um what does that mean what is it how do you steer the car it uh if it handles like like a go-kart um with a direct steering then the handling um how you're taking the curves how the chassis um is is reacting how is your seating position and all these um um factors are are important um for the drivability of of a car and at the end at Porsche to have a real sports car and for Porsche it is important having on the one hand side the sportiness the performance and on the other side um the abilities as a daily driver so you add all these together this kind of driveability what how does Porche differ from other cars yeah for Porche it's not only the acceleration um for us um is um putting into the car a lot of of Innovations um coming from Motorsports because we think um that um the RAC trck is the hardest testing field for our Innovations for example our pdk um the braking systems and um the hybrid systems and a lot of Innovations coming coming from mport and um that is important to to D from the competition it's not about um acceleration it's about um the driving abilities and our hardest measure is um the um time we are achieving on a racetrack for us for example the nring Nord Scher the famous one in in Germany or Laguna Seer and um there we know um every second um is important um to to build the perfect sports car what about the brand what what uh what is implied in the Porsche brand the brand is very important as as Porsche we were able to develop a iconic brand during um the over seven decades and it's a it's a Heritage of of our brand uh for what our brand uh stands for the um contradictions um in between um usability and and design um for for example play play a big role um then um the Porsche culture play a big role and at the end the iconic product um with um 356 our first model then the 911 and uh all the other models over the 718 um Cayenne Panamera um then then marar play player important important role and um this combination is what um our um customers love because we are the brand for those who follow their dreams who's your Target customer we haven't got a a um this special um Target customer um important for us to fulfill dreams M and um what kind of dreams that's to have a have a fulfill a life dream we have people um they stand for success and at the end to fulfill their own dream and um so uh our our customers um are are people um who love to to drive sporty cars who love um Brands and um at the end um to have um a high level of individualization exclusivity and um so um our customer profile uh around the world um is like this but for example the share of diversity is different in Asia um we have a share of 50% um male male and female um in the western world it's more 8020 why do you have a higher um penetration in uh in Asia in terms of email drivers yeah um because um they love the luxury positioning of um of Porsche we have a lot of very successful young ladies um in Asia entrepreneurs and uh that describes um the customer profile um perfectly that they are hardworking and um they are aiming for success and then the end and they are spending in luxury goods like like Porsche um loving the Heritage um of our iconic brand and on the other side the modern techn well I mean you have um kind of branched own with the likes of Maan um and you mentioned exclusivity but you do produce a lot of cars how do you balance exclusivity with the amount of cars you sell pora is positioned uniquely in the automotive industry on the one hand side we are a luxury player uh by um achieving a um average sales price over € 100,000 on the other side we have the opportunities of scale um we uh sold over 300,000 units um last last year and we are benefiting from the scale effects in between our brand but we have on the other side also the opportunity to benefit from the scale effects in Volkswagen group where we are collaborating um in terms of modules Parts um purchasing volume and so on and uh what is important for us being able on the other side to offer exclusivity whatever our customer um um ask us we are able um to to implement into into our car so we can say that no Porche you can compare with the other who is um leaving our production line now we're going to focus mainly on Porsche today but you are also the CEO of Volkswagen and so just remind us what is there in the Volkswagen group in addition to Porche I mean Volkswagen of course but what El yeah FKS Volkswagen group is is much bigger and FKS group um we are over 680,000 people working there and pors is a company with with 40,000 people um each of the brands in Volkswagen group um are different and for us is important um we are very International Group um that uh we have the culture um of um each each brand um where we are positioned like Lamborghini or Brentley we have the Italian culture the English culture for Bentley for example then we have Audi and and Volkswagen in in Germany scoda in in Czech Republic and um the big difference is the complexity um we do have to handle in in Volkswagen group um but um the great um issue is that um we are able to manage all these fantastic brands in in Volkswagen group and uh so um I think um each of these Brands something positive uh where where can you learn and and in my history I were able to to work at Audi um at Volkswagen and um at sead for example and in each brand um I've seen very positiv um practices I were able to implement also in Porche well I'm a happy driver of an Audi so that kind of Suits my temperament you know oh yeah happy happy to hear it now um if you look at the value of the group and we will not spend much time on this but uh it's fair to say that most of the value in the Volkswagen group is kind of tied up in the Porsche brand what what do you think that is telling us about uh the rest of the group is um yeah with with Porsche IPO we we have shown the value of the Porsche brand and we were able to to unleash the potential of of our brand with a very very successful IPO um with um very difficult um circumstances at this time and um the positive development shows um what potential we do have in in Porsche with our robust um Financial um profile and in Volkswagen group um I think um there is still um uh a lot to improve in terms of um the capital market value and uh we have shown a very robust um um result in 2023 implemented a clear strategy a clear restructuring plan and um this year we will bring um over 30 new products to to to the market and I think uh it has a lot to do with with trust um and um delivering um our result and then there's a big potential also on the Volkswagen group stocks um a big market for you is um is China how do you see the Chinese market now yeah in China we uh see a big um development in terms of Innovations um a um fantastic speed and so for us um it was a clear I um in Porsche to um build more um technology and Innovations in China for China for example our Porsche digital to offer our Chinese customers the Chinese um ecosystem um especially in terms of of digitalization we are very well positioned um in China in the luxury segment um over 500,000 rembe with an average um sales price of a million um Remi this is a segment of 600,000 units um up to now um they're um only International Brands um in this segment no Chinese Brands we think with our engine positioning um the mix of IC um plug-in hybrids and uh beffs we are well well positioned for for the market there's a strong demand but what is very important for us is also value over volume and so um it's especially last year we reduced our our volume not joining um the discount and and pricing War um we are faced in in China and that was um very very successfully maintaining um our luxury positioning there what about the electric vehicle Market in China how do you see that how do you how do you see competition yeah a lot of um new um competitors are entering in the market um but most of them um more in the volume and premium segment the luxury market for um electromobility isn't built yet um we have shown a market share over 30% for the taon in the luxury um electric segment now we are entering with a new Maan and the new tyon and that's a big opportunity for Porsche especially build this luxury segment um on um electrification important is that you're coming uh with big Innovations we are offering now um for example our new product there in the market and um having great opportunities to build the market when you drive um the comp with the Chinese competing cars what do you think they are very good in terms of digitalization um they are very good um in terms of voice recognition some of them have um very um good Advanced um autonomous driving um abilities and so I think uh the Chinese um have learned uh during the last decade um to build cars they are advancing very fast and um so um I think we don't have to hide for the competition in in China but it's worse um to have a look on um Chinese car makers and um that's my experience in my work life um wherever you are you can learn um something and uh to make yourself better and so we don't fear competition we are from the race track and competition makes you better and at the end um competition drives Innovations and Innovations are positive for the customer absolutely you mentioned digitalization so the whole infotainment system how is how important is that in today's car more and more important um the customers expecting um their digital ecosystem they used from their mobile phones for example Al in their cars and therefore um in pora we decided a own um new um board um Resort um driven by sachat Khan carrying about all the car it issues and infotainment is one important um offer we had dep peling for for our customers and there as I mentioned before also um developing Solutions in the regions of the world um in this case in China for China but also in the US uh we um have Partnerships and activities to provide to our customers so the perfect um infotainment system what about batteries um how do you see the Battery Technology moving the Battery Technology um have seen a big advancement during the last years especially in terms of chemistry um which um um led to bigger ranges then for us fast charging play play Big role Porsche was the first Ser manufacturer with a 800 volt system which brought us to charging time um 20 minutes from 10% to to 80% charging level and we are aiming for a even more improved charging time of around 15 minutes uh for the upcoming cars and so um we see a lot of potential um in the electrification and therefore we have a very ambitious Target um to achieve by 2030 80% of our cars fully fully electric because we think um that electromobility is um Superior than um the combustion engine cars because of the strong development during the last years and um the um still Unleashed potential of electric cars at the same time you invest in E fuels what what is the E fuel we think decarbonization from a global approach and uh we take over responsibility and we think also to all the um combustion engine um cars around the world but also chips and um aircraft um synthetic fuels um play Play important role when you're able to produce them in regions of the world where um renewable energies are unlimited the need of energy is higher comparing to um hybrids or to full electric cars but when you produce them there um there isn't um the argument anymore about um the need of energy and that's a combination um of hydrogen and CO2 coming um by air capturing um from the air and the big advantage of so-called e fuels is that the transport is very very easy without cooling or um putting them under pressure like you have to do it with hydrogen you can use the um net of um the existing filling stations you can mix them with traditional fuels and you can use um existing combustion engines and so it's a um additional argument for decarbonization especially in the transformation and um thinking about the regulation in Europe um maybe 20 um 35 when they won't um release any more combustion engine CS you will have the existing car still on the road and therefore we need a solution and therefore in addition to a strong electrification strategy we are investing also in E fuels u o when we last met you were super excited about the the launch program for next year tell me about it what are you launching what should we be waiting for here that's that's the biggest launching program um in the history of of Porsche um we are now um fully in the market with the new cayen uh we have had already um the market Premier for um the new Panamera then uh the new Maran in January in Singapore and um four weeks ago we were able to launch the new tyan and there especially the tyan GT for completely new model lines for Porsche and at the end of the year we're expecting a new 911 in the first time of the history um with hybrids and so um we are renewing five model lines of Porsche of our existing th and um that is a great ambition for um our team a great challenge we have to handle this year but a great opportunity for our customers which of these are you going to drive I'm in a good position to to test all of them I I love I love the 911 it's good to be the boss huh yeah that's a great Advantage um the 911 I I laugh and um I own 911s and um especially the new 911 and I test them with a Hybrid engine and the um tremendous acceleration and still having the six-cylinder boxer in the rear is fantastic um and today I'm driving a tyan the new one with more range um in wltp we are close to 700 Kil km of of range um fantastic charging times uh tremendous acceleration and uh what you have seen with the tyan GT um is also on the racetrack a um very very cool car with records on n large life or Laguna sea and so um both of these cars are fantastic and then um in the second half of the year will come the Maan and that will bring the Maan to a completely new level um full electric Maran with the offers of infotainment um char navigation or augmented um head-up display with a lot of um features where we will play um in the Premier League sounds cool now talking about the Premier League and coming back to Motorsport what what are the Innovations from Motorsport that you're integrating into these new models yeah Motorsport is the core of Porsche we are counting 19 victories in in Lemo for example this year we were able to win the 24 Hours of Daytona um The Heritage race um in the US and uh for us Motorsport is a toughest testing field for our Innovations and for example the new hybrid for um the 911 is a motorsport hybrid um which came from uh the 918 but at also um the oil cooling um we are using for our new Battery Systems we developed first for for Motorsport um the 800 volt system is coming from the Motorsport um is only three example what we are doing there we will continue continue to do so because uh we think Motorsport is a core of Porche and from Motorsport are coming the best Innovations changing um t a bit uh and moving on to of corpor culture just uh generally speaking how do you feel it is to do business in Germany in Germany um we are um in a in a situation uh where we are looking back to Decades of success or welfare um in the community and um that's not given for for the future it's like like in sports um when you win a cup um you haven't got um the Guaranty that you will win it the next year and so um that is um the situation in Germany um always thinking about um to to fight for for the success in in the country and so we have um some circumstances um which are not um so so easy to drive the business in terms of um Industrial regulations um energy pricing but um we are proud um being a German company founded in stutgart Sous and we produce the majority of our cars in in Germany because we think um that German quality is still a important brandmark um especially in terms of um of cars and so um we are in close CCT also um to the German government to improve um the the industrial um regulations and then um we think we have um um very qualified people in in Germany um we have perfect um engineering capacities and um so um Germany especially has got a big future um when we are um prepared and and able to um focus on our strengths we were able to show in the past if you could change three things with um uh the German industrial policy what would it be first of all um our our industry um is driven by speed and we have a lot of regulations not only in Germany and in Europe as well um to reduce regulations and um coming to faster um decision- making um in between um politics and and Industry then uh what we can um change is um the support um for um the industry um especially when when you're investing um there are also um decision making um processes but uh but also um subsidies um especially when you're going in new technologies and um that is important um for Europe and for Germany to having a clear master plan on which um new technologies we want to focus and um then in terms of um electrom Mobility I think it is important beside of the new products and the industry is bringing to the market also to support in terms of charging infrastructure in terms of new renewable energies and these three um points um I would like um to to speed up and and to change speed technology and and charging infrastructure um now you have a you have a long tradition in Germany of very high Union and employee engagement at uh at board levels and so on just what are the pros and cons of of working in this way yeah we are um acting as a as a family working working together and um for me is always important um getting a close feedback um also from from the labor side and um we are driving um the companies um to together with a entrepreneurial spirit and um there um counts the same as um we talked about um the politics um we we shouldn't um um increase um our regulations and agreement processes um we need the speed for for taking taking decisions I've have um very positive um experience working together with the worker unions when you deal fair and deal with full transparency you can solve um every every problem and um that's my um working experience of uh three three decades and that's um how I'm handling um the process um together with with our partners now you are CEO of two companies right so both Porsche and volksvagen how does this work how do you split your time yeah for me it was very important um when I have taken the decision also take take over the responsibility and in Volkswagen group to drive drive at the same time um Porsche because for me it's important to be very closely linked to technology to processes was a close contact UM to the people being able to take the right decisions um on the Strategic group level um it is a challenge very clear um in terms of organization but when you take the right priorities um it works and and now I'm driving this for over one and a half year and up to now um we haven't got a conflict in between I think it's very supportive driving both at the same time and it's not new in in Volkswagen group that a CEO driving a um a brand like fan P or Martin winter corn um have driven um also the brand of Volkswagen so I'm driving Porsche and Volkswagen group and um my um um feedback up to now after after one and a half years it works perfectly and is supportive do you have to change the way you behave when you go from more coment to the other you have like a Porsche cap and your Porsche shoes uh and then you move room and you put on something else or yeah leading leading um both shops is very very different um in in Porsche um I'm very um deeply involved in the operative processes and Volkswagen group is more strategic um there I'm leading 12 Brands and um the technical issues are similar but um on the end I have uh Partners CEOs of of All Brands um who are responsible for for the other brands and we are taking more um decisions how we can improve um our scale effects um in between the brands how we are driving together the performance programs and um taking strategic um technology decisions and there it's very very helpful that I'm very closely linked to the car business and uh being able to evaluate Technologies and taking these decisions and um so both of these jobs are very different one is more operative and the other one is more strategic when you are so involved with um technicalities and the technology in Porsche how do you avoid becoming micromanaging the whole thing or do you it's all about yeah that's that's all about priorities um I'm used since since many years uh to work uh with a so-called top 10 plan what are uh the most important um topics to solve um in in a year and that helps um to focus on the right things and I implemented this systematic and that's not important if you're talking about 10 points Five Points seven points you need the right priorities and beside of this um this embedded um in a longlasting strategy and um I built my strategy um terms of 10 years and and so I have a clear Focus where to lead the company but also with a operative program um year by year with the right priorities I know that you are skiing from time to time with oxun swindal uh my fellow Norwegian uh guy he's uh uh you know one of the best skiers of of all time so I asked him you know um how you were um how your skiing was he is good but he's almost more Fearless than he is good he goes fast so is that the way you the company as well yeah I I love it to to drive fast and axel Axel is a a great uh skier but also a great great person is ambassador of of Porsche and um I love it to be together with with him uh and hiding out for for skiing and and also on the racetrack he's a great great racer and um that combines us um we are coming from Sports and um I love it to to drive the company like a sports team on the one hand side focused on performance on speed on the other side on on team spirit and uh to working together helping each other winning and losing together and taking taking the right decisions uh with a um um same mindset I asked him whether you whether you ski faster than a Porche and he said thankfully not uh so I guess that's a good news but um you he totally right how do you um remain grounded uh kind of uh to to the factory floor when you have such important positions I yeah I I spent spent the most time in my professional life in in production and um so I'm still very closely linked um to um especially people people in production and uh when when I'm walking around in in the factory um there's still a very close contact and um people there um tell um tell you um The Honest um things in the truth in um what's what's going on in in um in a company and um that that's very very important for me and um I think um as a CEO of a company it's very important to be touchable for for the people and um with this you're getting getting the right feedback for taking the right right decisions and uh so so in Porche um we are um we like it to work very closely um with with the team and also having um events together and there being being touchable and um being very close to the to the team now you have a PhD in mechanic and Engineering um do you think you would have had the credibility with your uh with your colleagues if you didn't have that at the end is um uh your um your input in in the company and and your impact um you have um for me it was a good opportunity um when I when I started working at Audi doing a parallel a PhD and uh also um I did it in in China um over over 20 years ago and it was a great experience as a young man um going to to China and um feeling the um engineering and Innovation Spirit they started in these times um with electric vehicles where nobody else um thought in the success of electric vehicles and so for me it was a great experience working there in the M Automotive IND Institute of University in in Shanghai but in terms of credibility it it helps to to understand and to Deep dive into into Technologies but at the end um it's more important how you act um how you decide and how you work together with a team how much do you work a day around uh 12 12 hours um the depending um some sometimes in the in the evening and um one day on on the weekend um but for me is also important um to to have the right balance um in between work and um personal life um I love sports and that's also important um being being fit and um having the the right physics to being able to to drive um the company and in addition to skiing what kind of things do you do yeah I'm I'm soccer used to play soccer and um now um for me prefer to to run to jck and um then um mountain bike biking um is my favorite sport and sometimes I'm I'm going to play tennis so OE we got tens of um thousands of young people on the cour on them on the podcast here so if you were to give them an advice and that's not to go and save up to buy a Porsche but uh something else what kind of advice you you give them yeah I'm in the situation as a family father I have two two daughters and they started um the last year's um studies at University and I told them listen to your heart what you want to do and when you love things um you you're passion for them and at the end they're coming the the right results and um that was also my spirit in my whole career and that's my advice to to young people when they start a career for me it's um impossible to plan a career and um always Focus what you are doing um at the moment and at the end um the success will pay off well Ollie it seems like you have certainly listened to your heart and a lot of uh engines also I suspect during the years but uh big thanks for being on and uh and good luck in the fast lane yeah thank you very much Nikolai for the good talk and thank you very much for the great partnership in the Porsche stocks fantastic thank you
