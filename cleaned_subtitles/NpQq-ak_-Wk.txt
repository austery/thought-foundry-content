Hello odd lots viewers.
You are about to watch a conversation
with Tarek Mansour, CEO of Kelce.
This was recorded live onstage
at Chicago's Untitled Supper Club.
We had a blast
and we hope you enjoy the show.
Tarek, thank you so much.
Really excited to chat about the.
You're definitely having a moment.
The South Park episode, I think last night
was all about prediction markets.
Did you watch it live?
I try to avoid watching
or reading anything about us.
Yeah, without kind of getting the
the third party reaction before.
Oh, so we didn't know because we, we,
we saw the thing like the announcement
a few days ago there.
Yeah, episode prediction wise.
And we started kind of imagining all the
types of things that they're going to do.
It's crazy.
I mean, the highlight, I think is like,
they copied the app, like.
Yeah, exactly.
That was I mean,
they even had the refillable
and they even had some of the bugs.
We haven't.
They have.
It's like, oh, amazing.
It was unbelievable. So, but
you know, it was it was pretty cool.
I mean, there's a few parts
I disagree with, but the other
for the rest,
I mean, it really enjoyed it.
Yeah, I watched it this morning.
Why do you think prediction
markets are having this moment
now after they've been around for decades?
Literally. Why now?
Yeah, I mean, I think there's like
path dependance on these things. Right.
Like it's not sort of like,
I, I'm a strong believer
that sort of like, you know, in history,
you have to have a few agents
that sort of like push and, you know, push
the boundary of certain things and, and,
and so somebody's
got to do it type of thing.
But, my, my view on this and that's
why we started
the company is the fundamentals are there.
Like, this should be a very large market.
And we can talk a little bit
about the history, but
when we first started the company,
this idea of sort of
like a financial market
that prices questions about the future,
what sort of we were very drawn to it
because, you know, one,
if you could build
such a financial market,
it could be the largest of them all
because the largest number of people care
and the number two is could be
the most important because, you know, yes.
Pricing the the
you know, Sheriff Tesla is important.
But pricing
whether Brexit is going to happen
or you know, who's gonna win an election
or what's, you know,
sort of a
the next natural disaster are going to be,
I think that's at least
as important, if not more.
I at least from my perspective,
when I looked at the history
and you were chatting a little
about the history,
like the Elephant Room was regulatory,
it was, I mean, there's a very simple
kind of like first order factor here.
Well, well, it was illegal like.
Yeah. That, that that's pretty good.
That's tough.
Yeah.
And it's a pretty good reason
for something
not to, you know, generally kind of go
mainstream and exist.
And, and the legality has been sort of
the thing that has weighed on
all prior prediction markets.
I don't know
if you ever encountered Intrade.
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean I traded on there.
Well, you know, so here you go. Right.
I mean, Intrade was
you know, how that story kind of it ended.
How familiar are. You? I don't
I don't know how it ended.
So so John Delaney was
this was a sort of founder of Intrade
and is kind of a visionary.
I mean, like in many ways,
I mean, he really believed that,
you know, he was on CNBC back in 2000,
sort of like talking about the forecasts
for the election.
And so,
but he sort of ran offshore from Dublin
and it was kind of a like
a VPN type setup.
And then the company got shut down in 2012
by the government.
And two weeks later, John Delaney died,
and he died, climbed Mount Everest.
And there was a kind of whole
controversy of like, what happened.
I mean, was there
some sort of causation there?
But for us, when we we got really obsessed
by doing this and realized, like,
actually, that the only way for this
to go big is you got to legalize it.
Like, there was no other way.
And no matter how big the company
would get it, no matter how kind of
how much culture there was going to be around the company, it didn't really matter,
because the government could shut it down.
And they will,
after a certain level of scale.
And so this was sort of like we spent,
you know, three years and a half
when we started after starting Koski,
like all we did was basically
regulatory work.
It was like, how do we do fight exactly?
The fight was actually like more like
five years and a half, like three years
and have to get to legalize
prediction markets.
And that was sort of the whole thing
with the prior
administration
around, the election market, which we, we,
we were completely uncompromising on,
we had to do that.
And that was kind of a whole two year
long process that ended with our suing
the government, our own regulator.
And, and then I think that lawsuit,
I view it as sort of
the, the probably what the turning point,
is for these markets like
this is when we want that institution.
Like this is when everything changed.
I think. Yeah.
Would you have died
if Trump hadn't won in November?
No, it would have just been slower
and harder.
But no, not died.
I mean, we didn't die
under the harshest environment of all.
I think, like like, you know.
Well, the first.
Right, the first three years and a half
was like, well, this was just not allowed.
Right.
And we didn't, you know,
we kept sort of making progress on all
the way up until legalizing and launching.
But then, yeah,
the reality is like the prior government
I think was as hostile
as it gets, that it was just not
I mean,
they just didn't want it to exist, so.
Well, you say that like, it's
really important to have a change
in the regulatory landscape, that
there is no way this could have taken off
had this changed, had this not changed,
however,
there is a competitor that you can access
via VPN fund with stablecoins.
In theory,
there doesn't even need to be a company
that had been operating for several years.
Like what?
Like couldn't have happened?
And could it still happen
that the future of prediction markets
is on chain and essentially outside
of the regulatory landscape?
I don't necessarily think that on
chain, off chain is sort of necessarily
kind of an unregulated regulated like
like on chain doesn't mean a legal right.
Like, sure.
So but I think that.
Like but
there is a lot of volume on this entity
that had all kinds of things while,
you know. I'm sorry.
I'm talking about Poly Market. So,
It's not like we couldn't go on chain.
Right?
It's like, this is not a very hard thing
to build, right?
Like in terms of, like the, the,
and actually like, it's funny,
like the first two weeks,
of course, you tried to do something on
chain and realized like, well, again,
it was a good way to sort of be
maybe like somewhat smart
about regulated regulation,
but not really
because augur was on chain also.
And like that was also sort of shut down
and there was a bunch of issues,
for us, we stood very firmly
that like for this to go mainstream,
like you should avoid a VPN,
you know, and, and, and,
but but also like kind of
how do you, how do you,
how do you have this be legitimized?
Financial markets attract
the type of institutions that would trade,
you know,
a bunch of institutional partners
and now the brokers
and actually truly take this ministry.
It was just no,
no way to do it outside of like that's
the universe of financial markets.
You cannot do it outside.
You have to expand it.
And if you expand it,
then I think we have a real winner.
And I think the
results show like, you know,
yes, poly has a lot of volume, but like,
there's not real revenue yet.
There's a lot of wash like it's it's kind
of how do you account for all this stuff?
And even if you account for all of that
today, where like something
like three x bigger within a year.
So definitely want to talk
about the brokers and the market makers.
But before we do a very basic question,
but often the basic questions
are the most interesting.
Can you walk us through the life cycle of,
you know, a
binary event contract
that gets created on your platform?
It's a great question.
Because that's a hard problem, right?
Like,
because in traditional markets, right,
the life cycle is like, you know, we
we have an idea like, a grain futures
or onion futures or GPU, not. A
you don't do on your futures.
Onion futures is a bad idea.
But you can set up a prediction. You know,
what do I do? Things.
Actually, I do think it's a little,
lame that poorly market
like it hasn't done onion futures.
Because if you're going to like,
what's the point of on chain
if you're not sticking it to the man
anyway?
If like, the onion.
Farmers are like finally have
like instrument to hedge and yeah.
What's the point of crypto
if you're not using it to fight
against these absurd rules?
I mean, like, well,
the onion futures role is truly absurd.
Yeah, yeah.
I mean, it's like that's one of those,
but I guess now it's maybe kind of funny.
Maybe we should just keep it. But, like,
but but
you know, or like, I mean, or like GPU
if you mean, like the point here is, like,
you have something where the lifetime is
kind of like infinite,
you list the future and the derivative
and it's sort of there forever.
And then you build the liquidity
over time.
You can take your time.
It takes like usually
that these things take time.
They take years to kind of build up
to market them and build liquidity.
This is different, right?
Like this is much more dynamic.
It comes and goes like oftentime
the trend could be sort of like there
for 2 to 3 weeks,
sometimes a week, sometimes it's a day.
And you have to be much more, much faster.
And kind of my mental model for what
this looks like, it's
sort of like there's an idea
that can be from a user, from a, from
the news, from a trend, from some tweet.
Then there's a listing of the market,
and then there's kind of like
from a listing to kind of making it
reasonably liquid and active.
It's interesting
because, you know, the first time.
So we've, we've gone through like a,
all kind of types of regulatory winters.
But the first time we listed a market,
it took us 18 months.
That was just for listing.
And because there's a lot like operations
attack.
These are tickers, right?
Like you list them like a stock or like a,
like WTI crude oil.
Yeah. Now we do it within 30 minutes.
And so we've expanded the territory
quite a bit.
And, and most.
And when you list it, does it
go to the CFTC or what.
Basic. Removal process. Yeah.
Because there's like a self-certification
which is basically fight with the CFTC.
And they kind of like
generally they
historically is basically like
if you file it and you haven't engaged
with them beforehand,
they usually will basically block it.
They'll call you and say, stop
until we talk, and then you do it.
But now we've covered so much territory
and we've built so much technology
and like the operations and the regulator
in the loop that, like most new things
that we do, actually fit into a bucket
that we've already done.
And sometimes they're arguably new things.
Like right now, the frontier is actually
some of the SEC like company
related markets,
I think is this sort of next frontier.
But we've covered so much ground now
that, like,
most things are like of a similar flavor.
We've been going this whole time,
you know, you talk about company related
stuff, talk about hedging onion futures
maybe hedge or sorry hedging onion prices.
Maybe you want to
strip out something
related to Tesla car sales.
But let's talk about the business.
How much of this is sports right now?
How big is the gap
between volume on a Sunday versus volume
on a Wednesday?
Volume on a Sunday is very, very big.
But like, it's it's interesting.
I mean, like the,
I'll say a few things, like,
I loved,
the sports side has gone like, it's.
I mean, I'm shocked. I'm still shocked.
Yeah.
Like, every week
we do a forecast and we beat it and like,
I mean, America likes NFL.
I mean, I don't
I mean, they like football,
but I don't know more than I expected,
I guess. But,
the it's a little bit more than that.
Like, you know,
the thing about sports is,
but, see, there's two things going on.
One, there's
just a lot of scheduled events, okay?
There's just a lot in the week.
But if you compare, like a 1 to 1,
like a game to,
like basically anything that Trump does,
Trump will win.
Like, you know, like the
there was a volume 1 to 1.
Like these markets do really, really well.
And it could be literally unlike any
I mean, anything he does
the problem there is like
there's not enough scheduled like that.
Aren't that many of them.
I think they may be over.
But just like.
What percentage is on Sunday?
Like it's not
I mean, probably 90% of sports
on like a regular
weekday is like much lower.
And what's the gap in volume
between Sunday and maybe.
Okay, okay.
So like yeah I mean NFL
Sunday is like massive.
But it's a little bit
like it's it's a little bit
like asking the question like okay
well on Election Day what was the volume.
Right. Yeah.
It's like 99.9% elections. Right.
So so sports is very large.
But like we have other categories
now like like culture for example
I think is like growing at a similar rate.
It's just starting
from a much lower baseline.
And our market diversity,
our liquidity is just not there yet.
Whereas sports is much more kind of like,
I would say like much more diverse
and much more liquid.
Yeah. Okay.
So I'm going to ask the obvious question,
I guess, but why is it not sports betting?
You know, I don't I don't get like
as much wrong with the word betting.
I think gambling is sort of where it
where I have a problem.
I mean,
you know, when like, CME launched
water futures, like 3 or 4 years ago,
I, you know,
I remember like the headline about
that was like,
oh, you can now bet on water.
It's like, all right.
I mean, I guess the word betting is used
very sort of loosely, but like,
look, I got two things.
I sort of the legal question
and there's sort of the,
the, at the whole
is this good for society question.
And those are my.
Yeah for sure that matter. We'll do
both of them don't worry. Yeah.
I mean I guess so.
So the legal question I mean like
our approach has always been sort of legal
and regulated first,
like always do it
within the bounds and expand the bounds.
So we did this
prediction market and elections.
You know, I mean a year ago right. Yeah.
Well a year ago even like
I mean people were saying
this is going to destroy democracy, right.
Like it it was
it was the end of the world.
If we ever got legalized and like,
you know,
and like it was and then we got legalized
and it was like super biased.
And, you know,
I was being accused of being Mossad agent.
I, I don't even remember that
period. But like, it was like.
I missed that one.
I was like, it was like a whole thing
about, you know, I worked at Palantir
and that's I'm obviously kind of rigging
the election, but like,
and obviously the vibe has shifted
pretty dramatically with the election.
And because, you know,
there is some kind of biases market.
So when it comes to sports
like on the legal piece, like it is
legal, like the CFTC could stop it
if they wanted to, but the states can't.
That's called preemption
and that's how it works.
And where an extremely strong
legal footing.
I mean, Dan was mentioning
sort of this year,
I don't think city is asleep at the wheel.
Like, you know, they have less staff,
they have staff.
And the staff is a way of sports.
We talked about it.
It's not like we showed up one day like,
hey, surprise, it's worse.
Markets are here.
Like.
Isn't Trump's nominee also on your board?
The nominee for CFTC?
Well, he was ex nominee now.
I mean, we'll see.
But I mean, I don't know,
but I don't know if it's nominee.
But like they're
just going to have questions.
But I, I
he was not there when this happened.
And like he was you know
so he's still not there actually.
So I don't think it's very relevant
to the question.
I think the change of the administration
is relevant to the question.
Like, yes.
I mean,
I think it would have been much more
challenging in the prior administration.
Like, there's no question about that.
But the law is pretty clear. I mean,
if you read the Commodities Exchange Act,
there's like a two pronged test,
and it is an event kind of related
to war, tourism,
assassination, violence or gaming.
And then there's
some sort of illegal stuff
that's illegal under state or federal law.
And so you can fall under that category,
we could debate whether this falls
under gaming or not.
And there's actually quite
a bit of debate there.
And then the second test, which is like
if it does fall into this category,
the CFC can make an explicit determination
that it's contrary to public interest.
Right.
So there is that sort of second standard.
Yeah. Which raises the second
question, which is like,
I'm just I'm a believer in markets
like I think a market based model for
this market is better than the over
the counter sportsbook model,
because the odds are better
anyone could be a price better.
They don't have to be a price taker.
And the results show like less people.
I like the percentage of people that
basically lose on couches closer to 5050.
That's just not the case
in like a traditional sports.
And I think that's the sort of argument
that wins it long term, which is like
this is just better.
Like you get better prices,
more transparency and the ability to,
you know, influence,
like basically participate
in a way represent an additional model.
You already said, that
you don't think that
the distinction is not between trading
and betting.
The distinction is between
betting and gambling.
So you sort of preempted a question.
But there is this Facebook ad that I saw
and it says breaking news.
Sports betting in California is now legal.
And I saw a screenshot of
I couldn't find it.
I found it on a blog.
But is that like an actual Kelce
ad that ran?
Well, we have a very large marketing team
and this is the ad is not there anymore.
But like regardless, I mean,
So that was doing it.
Well, you got.
To imagine
a company has like rule 100 like. Again.
But like so like like nothing.
You know, you're seeing like,
breaking news.
It like, I guess what I'm saying is, like,
we all know what's going on
there is just breaking.
I mean, it is legal to trade on. Yeah.
I mean, that's big news, you know. Yeah.
And we are
I mean, you know, and so but like
I do actually think like
I'm not as worried about this like like,
you know,
the word gambling
is the one that really irks me.
Like, you know, because.
Like,
okay, zero zero DT options like, yeah.
Like what retail is doing
what, like $1 trillion of volume?
I mean, you probably know the numbers.
What is it, Tracy?
Cronos I can't remember, but it's a lot.
Yeah.
So what is retail doing there like hedging
I mean, right now,
what exactly are they doing?
They're gambling.
I don't know about that.
No, I think I mean, I think it's fun,
like I, I agree with like this
premise that the idea of.
Like dry line, it's
basically like like it's it's
the sort of thing where like,
I mean, in 1905,
I think we talked a little bit about this,
like the Supreme Court.
There was this whole question
of grain futures and like,
should it be gambling
or should it be a financial instrument?
And if it was gambling was going
to go under the bucket shop laws.
And, and and it was this Supreme Court
case,
Chicago Board of Trade versus Christi,
where the Supreme Court basically
like ruled in favor
of the Chicago Board of Trade,
which is like, yes,
a lot of people are speculating,
but there's value to these markets
beyond the actual speculative,
you know, activity is taking place.
And then you get into
the question of like,
what is the standard
the commodities exchange act like,
should all the activity be hedging?
Well, if that's the case
then you let's just cancel the whole act.
Let's just stop trading altogether.
Because in most markets, including grain
features like 95% plus is not hedging.
It's speculative.
And I think that's true
in the stock market.
And so you know and then like okay,
well how do you distinguish and you know,
should we take out the spec
and even just keep the hedging.
Well if you do that
then there's no liquidity.
And so it doesn't work.
And then how do you even know
who's hedging and speculating.
Do you go and check.
Sure. Yeah.
So so you go into all these
different questions. But like
to me gambling is
sort of like you create an artificial risk
and then you, you roll a dice
and then you gamble on it, you know.
But trading on whether Brexit happened
or not, that's just like a natural risk.
That's sort of there.
And then the second question is that.
And to me, the even more important
one is like the the market based
mechanism versus sort of like you
walk into a casino, the odds are like
structurally stacked against you.
And actually if you start making money
like in the best case scenario,
they basically, you know,
stop you from participating.
And that happens in sports.
Also in other the worst case scenario
they like kneecap you right.
Like that.
And so that to me is gambling.
Like it's like the
the revenue of the company
is equal to the losses of its customer
and vice versa.
And I,
I just don't think this is the same year.
Like, that's not how the New York Stock
Unit makes its money.
It makes its money based on fees.
Same with Robinhood, same with,
you know, and, you know, same with Casey.
And so I think there's a
there's a big structural difference.
Well, this was going to be my next
question, actually.
So setting aside the gambling terminology,
part of your argument here is that
even if it is betting,
it is somehow qualitatively different
than traditional betting,
where, you know, you have a sportsbook
maker who's setting all the prices.
And you said earlier
that there is more transparency and fairer
pricing and all of that.
But then again,
if you look at some of the words
that your own company has used to describe
this, you've put up job advertisements
saying that you need experts in something
similar to sportsbook pricing.
No, this that's not quite right.
Now that the job advisor sports operations
listing the markets, how to settle down
all these different things.
What's that dynamic is very
I mean similar right.
Like you have to know
which markets to list how to list them.
What are their price feeds to kind of like
pull up to, to bowl to basically settle
whether it's sort of like
this team one versus the other.
That's very different from like,
you know, we need,
I don't know, like someone
who is like an expert in, like, you know,
like, programed
to, like, you know, bring in traders
and figure out how to optimize, like,
you know, how to, like, optimize,
like, losses and things like that.
Like, this is very, very different.
Well, talk to us
how the prices are actually set. That.
And why does, you know, a platform
that ostensibly is
a peer to peer trading platform
need market makers at all?
Well, if you listen to market right
now, like on let's
let's give an example on, on,
like even fed rates,
you got to kickstart somehow, right.
Like the financial markets
aren't market makers, right.
And they appear like financial markets
are the ultimate version of peer to peer.
That's what they are.
But it's basically a way to kickstart
and which I think
actually are most liquid markets.
The more successful a market becomes,
the more profitable market becomes,
the lower the percentage of market
makers like, whether it's like partners
like Susquehanna and institutional market
makers and others.
And the higher it is, it's it's
basically organic liquidity.
So actually, the more successful it is
and the more profitable for us.
And like, you know, anybody,
it's the lower
the participation of these market makers.
So the use is actually like,
you got to have somebody
that starts to bid ask like you,
otherwise you what am I kidding?
There's nothing. It's just that.
And so you have to kind of
break the chicken and the egg.
In some ways
you start with the chicken
and you incentivize that chicken
so that the egg comes,
and then you basically
get the flywheel rolling.
So I think it's kind of exactly
the same as financial markets.
And like a lot of our liquidity
is in the non liquid market
smart and market driven.
And the liquid markets
non-market market maker driven.
Basically let's talk about some non-sports
stuff and the future.
Like any anything you could sort of
future tries anything right.
When you envision it.
Could you have
could we one day have a future
for every single stock on the exchange?
A perpetual future,
a perpetual Tesla future,
a perpetual apple
future, a perpetual like?
Could it be a world that we live
in one day and a perpetual ten year
Treasury future?
I mean, cash is everything in Arabic,
right? So.
So you know, the long term
vision is like, yes, I mean, the the
I just think like
we should have a market for.
Perpetual,
or a future for private companies.
Space future. Yeah.
And you know, like
the idea is so kind of get like one,
I guess, general and then specific.
Answer to that specifically.
So the general sort of principles, like,
I think anything that has a difference
of opinion, difference of opinion,
of qualitative opinion should
basically have a mechanism
to resolve that quantitatively.
So like instead of debating subjectivity
or something like let's debate about it
objectively and quantitatively,
which is trading, you know, what's a mine.
And so
and then there's some limits like I,
I think there are markets
that do create bad incentives.
And I think, actually CIA does
handle them.
And like we,
we really haven't done these markets.
But to your question, like, yes,
I think that's, that's probably
what the next frontier looks like.
And I and I think that the concept
of security futures
has been like a very kind of like
would say it's
been a very exciting concept for that.
I mean, even Pre-calc it's not sure where,
but I think the CFTC SEC relationship
historically
has been a big part of the bottleneck,
because if you're on the SEC side,
you can't be
do you don't really do futures.
And if you're an CFTC like you've
you don't need securities.
And you had this question
like should I get right.
By both I mean yeah you already have one.
That's sort of I mean
you're like daily in your operations
already.
Very tough.
Now you're adding a second one
and it doesn't scale linearly at scale.
It scales sort of quadratically.
And so it's been really tough
historically.
But maybe now in this environment
I think it might be possible
and maybe,
maybe we'll figure it out on Monday.
So we'll see.
Yeah. On Monday. Okay.
Can I go back to the market makers
for a second?
Because this is an area where I think
people have a lot of questions, but that
what are the actual obligations
of market makers on your platform?
And you talked about how in the beginning,
you know, maybe you have this really
esoteric contract
about throwing rubber objects
on to basketball courts or whatever it is.
We don't. Have that. But, you know.
But that's. The other. Guys.
Theoretically. Yeah.
The other player.
That won the CFC would like to go.
How do you market
makers decide what contracts
to actually support initially, and
are they obligated to come in and provide
like for everything?
No, because well, not everything. No.
Because like well though
if well you have fair access
sort of requirements
and and a CFC regulations,
do you have to have rules
that like basically I generally like,
accessible by anybody,
in a certain
sort of like tranche or two or whatever.
But like if I'm like make a wants
to come and trade on Cassie,
they could do that
and they have no obligation.
They can make, they could take,
they could do whatever they want.
Generally what happens is like,
you know, if a market
maker wants like, okay, but then
how do you kind of incentivize liquidity?
Then you could sort of say like,
okay, maybe you rebate you some fees
if you basically commit to obligations
and the obligations,
the way they look like is
like if you make on the fed market.
So that's an actual specific example
like you put like 75,000 contracts
up on each side
within like for 3 to $0.04 spread.
And you have like 98% availability or so
you're pretty much there every time we
we kind of probe, you could, for example,
get your fees that you pay rebated
so you don't have to pay.
So that's kind of like actually
our most common type of I mean, this is
pretty much like the market program.
A lot of them are public.
And people can sign up to which markets
they want to participate in.
So some people sign up to economics,
some people do politics,
some people do sports.
Some people do a combo of what
a lot of people do.
Financials.
And the reason you want that actually
is because without any sort of structure,
then no one's going to commit to anything,
right?
Like then people will only do it
when it's like advantageous for them,
and they won't do it when it's,
maybe like a novel market where we need
to kind of bootstrap liquidity and so on.
So you have to figure out the sort
of set of incentives,
especially in the beginning.
And those over time go down
as the market goes more and more liquid,
as you need less and less of them.
And are the rebates and incentives
and I guess the information
is that equal for all the market makers
on the platform because you also happens.
In the obligations. Okay.
So like it's not like a you don't
do something for like you don't do well.
So well finish the sentence.
Well I was going to ask about Katie.
Yeah. Yeah.
So people ask a lot about category
so fully it's fully information
like we've operated for five years.
It's fully siloed. Informationally.
It's like run independently and so on
and so forth.
What I can say, like emphatically,
Katie has absolutely no advantages,
like in any way, shape or form of other
market makers or market participants.
And we've always said that,
you know, we're
we don't think of this as a
flank because it's true. And,
the CFTC
audits us and they see the numbers
and the numbers, you know, are factual.
They're not the best performing, trader,
let alone market maker on call sheet,
by orders of magnitude, like,
you know, I'll leave it at.
They're successful
because they're not that successful.
They're doing okay.
I would say like and it's it's fine.
It they, they, you know,
try to kind of like push optically
and some markets are harder
and so on and so forth.
And that's a good thing.
Like otherwise these markets would sort of
not be there.
But I'll say for sure is
they don't have any privileges
or, you know, benefits
aside from anybody else.
Aside from saying aside from
we have some small teams, 2 or 3 people
that sign up to market maker programs.
Some of these teams are actually beating
all the other market,
the institutional at including ours,
institutional usually better than ours.
But like,
what we do is like there's like tiers.
So if you kind of like abide by certain
conditions, you can get more rebates,
than if you do lower conditions
and less rebates.
And those is accessible
to anybody that basically would do
the conditions uniformly.
One because regulatory wise, we have two
and then two
because otherwise, like,
we wouldn't trust the sort of marketplace.
So yeah, there's no, no, no.
Like, we got accused a lot of a lot of
different things, you know, but like,
that's normal.
I mean, there's like a lot of incentives
and interest there
on the other side of this equation
for, for specificity.
Okay.
Now sports at the time, it was elections.
But I think that kind of like
we let the truth mean revert over time.
So obviously you have these sort of legacy
market makers who are now
participating on your platform.
You mentioned Susquehanna, etc..
Have you seen like, I'm very curious about
whether we'll see legacy institutions
and use
become actual sort of like use your market
for actual hedging purposes.
Now, I'm
sure there's some around the election,
but some of these other things
like I'm curious, for example,
do you know other hedge funds
that might have a particular trade on
and they want to, hedge
against the possibility
of a negative NFP print because they think
that a bad jobs report is going to bust
some trade like that is the risk
or maybe a sort of hot CPI trade, etc..
Do you see institutions
using these markets yet
to actually take hedging
or positional trades yet?
So I think that,
so yes, but it's a kind of a size thing,
right.
Like the main
bottleneck is basically liquidity.
And it goes back to same question.
It's like you have to incentivize
more and more liquidity over time
so that like, you get the larger size,
it's like a typical
I mean, the way I think about
it is like there's a small prop shops
and the smaller shops like those are doing
some and like because you can take
millions of liquidity on cash, it's
not that difficult now.
Depends on the markets and so on.
But then if you get to sort of the buy
side firms like the larger.
Yeah, you know, like you know, where it's
going to top 1015 on the street.
1015 hedge funds on the street.
And then after that, corporations like,
then you're talking like the minimum
minimum size,
like for even to care is eight figures,
but probably 50 to 100 million.
And so I don't think the equity is there
quite yet.
Like elections start flirting with that
sort of level and we start we've seen some
but like the
we don't see that like it's just a matter
of time for liquidity to build up.
Okay.
For the kind of like deep institutional
use case to basically start kicking in.
And I think I see this over the next two,
three years.
Like, I think that's going to be
a very big part of
it's always been part of the vision
because you
you create a marketplace
where you can price anything.
You know, what you're doing at that point
is you're pricing risk, sure pricing.
Anyways. It's
sort of happening in the world.
And then when you price the risk, it's
much easier to to create the liquidity
the same way.
It's easy to create liquidity
for the option market today.
That's much higher
for some esoteric event,
as there's more and more price benchmarks,
then you can provide more liquidity.
And then after that,
we can basically really cater
to the sort of institutional risk
transfer, use case,
which I think is kind of where
the time really expands.
Launcher.
I mean, I assume in addition
to talking to regulators, a big
chunk of your time is spent going out
and talking to institutional players,
either on the market making side
or maybe by side who might one day
potentially be interested
in actually using this as a hedge.
What are those conversations
actually like?
You know, you you have this partnership
with Susquehanna now.
What are the concerns that they lay out
when it comes to this new business?
And what are the sort of I don't,
I guess, enticements that you offer? So,
I would say, like right
now it's a lot more just like learning.
It's not to say like, hey,
our approach is much more like,
let's we learn, we learn,
and then we figure out how to build
the right product. And then people come.
It usually works that way.
Not sort of like, oh, like sort of come.
Did Susquehanna did they approach you
that?
We have it.
It took a while.
I mean, like we had a relationship,
like we kind of when we started like
thinking about the company.
And this is where an issue with like
a lot of the sort of institutional players
and like the market makers
and I mean, I like to say that before and,
but like,
I don't know if like we have,
but I mean, we just had a relationship
when we started talking and,
you know, they see division like so
Susquehanna really believes
I mean, Jeff, yes.
Really believes in the vision
of sort of like this idea of like
have some skin in the game to forecast
any, any question about the future
instead of debating about it.
And he's always like prediction market.
So there's a little bit of a natural
fit there.
But but like going back
to the kind of institutional like
what we learned is like
it's there, right?
A lot of them, whether they price these
specific events like NFP specifically,
or like a CEO or leaving a company
specifically or they're worried about it,
like even if they don't price it
specifically, but they're sort of like,
this is something that I'm worried
about on my thesis.
Like, I have a thesis,
but these are some of the external factors
that could, like,
screw it up. That's a real thing.
And like they would use it for hedging.
And I think the requirements of it's like,
okay,
some of them that are like
sort of like compliance, regulatory like,
you know what, you have a clearinghouse
regulated, all that kind of usual stuff.
But then there's liquidity.
Like how much size can I take for it to be
worth it for me to kind of allocate a desk
and, you know, put resources into it.
And then the second one is like margins,
which like, you know, today
it's fully cash collateralized on couches.
So if you want to trade
$100, you have to put it up.
That's very difficult for like you say,
Citadel.
Well. Yeah.
I was going to ask actually,
do you anticipate on the roadmap
sort of beside traders
when there is perhaps if it happens,
sufficient liquidity,
will they be trading on Kelce
or will it be something
they trade through their prime broker
or their futures broker.
Whose would you like.
Are you in talks with the brokers.
Yeah same exact sort of like I mean said
like what do you need basically like
and how does it work.
But yes, I mean the prime brokerages
are, are very important, because like,
you get,
you basically get
like they have the full portfolio
so you can get a bunch of margin benefits
if you kind of
do it all with one prime broker.
And that's why usually prime brokers
are the gateway into financial markets.
Yeah.
And the same way as our broker strategy
for retail, right.
Like what the Robinhood
and people on some of the other brokers.
Right.
It's very similar actually, because you
have your portfolio with the prime broker.
And then like as you're thinking about
a portfolio is like,
hey, I could add on a hedge
and it's much easier for me to do it
through my prime broker
than do it on a separate platform.
But by the way, it's pretty crazy.
If you go to the App Store
and you just like, look at Robinhood, it's
the first thing is like the foot,
but the image of the football, right?
Yeah.
Because they're trading through you
anyway.
Just an interesting
cultural on that point.
I mean, there is a social utility question
here, right?
Like if I download Robinhood okay.
Yes, I could get into 0 or 1 day options
and we can talk about
the social utility there.
But maybe I'm going to invest in an actual
stock that generates some income.
But now I'm seeing ads for football
and sports betting.
And I don't know, I'm sure there are
some old fashioned people out there
potentially like me, who would say,
who would say like, what does this do?
What's the value.
Thing that, do you think that sports like,
let's even forget about like.
I mean, first of all,
I don't like sports. But.
Well, I mean, but, like, you know, I mean,
a lot of people love sports, right?
I mean, like, you know,
I don't know, I think that, like,
my general view with these things,
I mean, I'm a free market person, like.
Sure.
Building a company
where the name is, you know,
we want to have markets for everything.
So, so,
I'm much more in the camp of, like,
you know, you figure out what people want
to do and figure out how to do it
in a safe, equitable and fair manner.
Like,
you know, make sure that like it's it's
done with fair rules of the road
for everybody to participate.
And they want to get smart
and do their own research.
And if they don't, that's on them.
And they figure it out and,
and add some sort of checks and balances,
around it to make sure it's safe
and there's customer protection and,
but it's you that like I'm
a strong believer that, you know,
sort of
the job of regulators should not be,
dictating what people should do
with their money, or their lives.
Like, I'm, I'm a very, very strong,
like, staunch opponent of that
sort of view
of what a regulator should do.
And I think that's fits there.
I mean, in some ways maybe that's like,
like if you look at Robinhood, like
there's all these choices now and like
it's a bit weird to me
that like the decision
here is, is sort of like,
don't let them make the choice.
Like if they want to invest in gray,
then if they want to do football,
then also great.
I mean and decisions.
That feels weird to me,
which is like hide that option
because the 50 year old
or 30 year old man that's on Robinhood
needs me to figure
out what, what to do with their money.
Right. Like and so that to me,
that was always felt weird to me.
And I think that's where financial
regulation has sort of like gone too far.
And the I don't even call it regulation.
I'm, I'm very pro regulation.
And we chose to be regulated upfront.
Right, right, right.
So but it's sort of like I would say
like I would say,
I mean, people are like, what, law fair.
But whatever.
Like the financial regulators,
I think I've taken it too far
and that in that dimension.
So, as we've mentioned, a couple of times,
there's this big,
meeting in DC next week.
There's going to be a roundtable,
incidentally.
So Tracy mentioned it, earlier
in the day, we,
interviewed Terry Duffy for an episode,
and that'll be out in a couple of weeks.
And I guess you haven't met.
He said you've never met, but
I guess you're going to meet on, Monday.
But what, like what should we ask?
Tarik and he said,
I think if I'm getting this right,
he said that Robin or that Kelsey
characterized itself as CFTC approved.
And he says it's not that.
It's instead not CFTC ban that actually,
because it's the self listing.
Yeah.
Are you CFTC approved and or is it just
that the CFTC has not said no.
Let's
factually incorrect I mean I don't know.
You know, it's like I mean,
which I am based out of meaning tag.
I mean, there is legend, but like,
Well,
we got a license and then a second one.
Okay, exchange
and then the clearinghouse. I mean.
And then the and then the broker license.
So the exchange was like in 2020
and the and the clearing house 2024.
And then the broker one was in, 2025.
There's all approvals.
I mean, it's not like, you know.
But for instance, the individual contracts
that go up to the CFTC
are those each getting approved?
Well, they just are.
Not actually disapproved.
Right. Like and we had to sue over it.
And it was a
and we were clearly right on the law
given that we won the district
and then the and and the appeals court.
So, maybe there's like a
separate dimension here,
which is also the regulation,
not always rights, but, you know, sure,
there's a whole other thing there.
But but
self-certification is, is, is a regime
which, by the way,
CME is also operated within.
And they, you know, so from a from
that specific perspective for each market.
Yes. It's
not that every market goes through
as a prospectus like in the SEC
and then gets approved.
It's actually like a disapproval regime.
Yeah.
But the CFTC has authority to say things
and it's a very broad authority.
Right. So,
maybe it's a good question on the CFTC
because, you know,
I can't speak on their behalf.
But. Oh, you can ask them on Monday.
Yeah. We got to be on that table, but,
you know.
Oh, what is the,
What are we talking safety all the time?
But yeah.
So, you know, obviously,
Poly Market is a major competitor to
what do you see as, like,
what's your vision
for what is traded on chain
and what are like, could you imagine?
You know, we just talked to Don. He said
he could see
in five years almost everything
being on chain.
Like, do you see that.
Yeah, maybe.
I mean well it's interesting
because poly now is
so there's kind of the on chain strategy
and then the kind of what we did,
the regulated, you know. Yeah.
Normal clearinghouse
like private clearinghouse strategy.
And like, now what they're doing is sort
of they're pivoting to ours, basically.
That's, that's
and so our view jelly is like, well,
it's a pretty positive sign
for our strategy.
Probably. Right.
Because, you know,
But but even setting aside.
Companies like for you, to me,
it's a regulated like front.
It's more. Sure.
So so okay, there are a lot of benefits.
I really believe that.
And I think the. The
to being to understand.
Okay. Yeah. Because like,
one of the ones that I'm less interesting
is sort of like skirting regulation
like that.
But, but but I think that like there's
a number of things which is like
my mental model for it is, is a bit like,
you know,
the banking rails are set up
in the kind of early 20th century.
It's like JP Morgan,
a bunch of his friends are like, hey,
how do we dominate this whole thing?
And you know, they set up a bunch of regs
and then they close the door behind them.
And that was sort of that.
And there's a bunch
more complexity to that.
But to me it this sort of whole on chain
thing is a is imagine a bit like having
given
that problem to a bunch of smart like,
like hard working,
developers without any limits
and let them build.
Right.
And obviously that's going to be
there's a lot of good
that's going to come out of that,
and then there's going to be some bad that
comes out, comes out of that, obviously.
But like to me is like, well, there's
a lot of liquidity on on chain today.
So that's
that's something that we should access.
And some point to
I think the clearing side,
there's a lot of benefits, for, you know,
how like you have to do innovation
and you have to do,
immutable immutability
and you that right now we do it from a
like operational legal perspective.
And obviously there's some tech, but,
you know,
launching really helps with that.
That's like basically
what it's designed to do.
And so
over time, like, I think, I hope
as sort of regulators get more permissive,
like I see some parts of clearing going on
chain where, you know, it enables
some of these use cases
and also more transparency, like the,
the trades and the transactions
are all transparent for everybody to see.
And then people can build interesting
like UI and interesting projects on top
without us having to sort of this whole
permission list sort of concept.
And so I'm very bullish on it.
I do agree with Don, actually,
that like over the next 4 or 5 years
in economies
like Robinhood, like companies
like a lot of companies are leaning in,
I think, while cash is also leaning in.
So pretty excited about it.
So obviously the trajectory
of your business has changed enormously
just over the past year,
less than a year, really.
If you were
thinking about it now, today,
as we sit here, what's the biggest,
I guess, blockage to further growth
for calculating.
You know, right now.
So the question
I haven't been really thinking about
is when it's growing so much right now,
it's like all about like how do we like,
not break basically because like,
I mean, honestly, like we grew way
more than we could have possibly imagine
even in the most bullish scenarios.
Even post winning the election lawsuit,
like even like December 2024.
What, like a forecast for 2025?
Like it was, it was nowhere near
what it what it is today. So
and it's interesting because we're not
it feels like we're sort of like
halfway through, like there's
still just the current structure.
I think we're not even halfway through.
Like we have more brokers.
So like we have a very deep
pipeline of brokers. So that's great.
And more sports, I think it's
the frontier is the SEC thing.
So I think it's like more markets like
and I think we have a lot of what we want.
I think over time is like
how do we start doing company related,
prediction markets?
And we're very excited about that.
I just have one last question,
and it's kind of a softball.
But like after years of fighting
all these different battles,
regulatory battles, issues with states,
etc., like how good does it feel?
It must feel really good
to actually kind of know
that the business is real
and have these battles.
Yeah. I mean, like just like describe
that feeling.
It's weird because I don't know if I feel
that would try to this year
than last year.
I mean, Logan, I only saw the company
we really build a company around.
I love this book.
So have you ever read the book
like discord takes care of itself?
I don't think.
It's a great book,
but like, like everything, honestly, like,
I really it's just
all right now, you know, like,
So John Warren was sort of basketball
coach, like most legendary it I mean,
the whole thing was always about, like,
never mentioned winning about chain.
The team is like,
focus on the process and like day
in, day out, like just fall in love
with trading and like,
if you do, you just start winning.
And like I would say a few things.
I see these things.
I sort of there's good times and bad times
for all companies.
And so yes, right now
we're having a pretty great time.
Like as good
as it gets for, for a company.
But I don't feel that different.
I think it's just like solutions
bring new problems
and like you,
then you focus on the new problems.
It must be so much, you know,
go to work on building rather than.
Pretty good at winning the election
lawsuit like that one, because we were so
there was some pretty big time vindication
there.
Like, I think we were,
you know,
because imagine like in 2020, like
three going up to our board, you know,
like Sequoia and a bunch of others.
It's like, hey, like, yeah,
we're not really figuring this out.
It's been two years of like,
you know, pouring money
into this and like,
you know, and nothing is working.
We lost half our team over it.
And like, company might die.
And actually what we're going to do is
to a triple down and sue a regulator now.
So it's you know that was a
they looked at us.
They're like
well that that that doesn't feel right.
You know like
and we still went through with it
and like it ended up
being absolutely the right decision.
So that I think maybe like October 7th,
the day we won the election loss,
it was probably the day I felt happiest.
What did you do
when the CFTC dropped the lawsuit?
That was not that important.
It was the one where we the appeals were.
You actually got.
This? Yeah.
Yeah, that was important because,
Well, I first screamed a lot and like,
we just, like, all the face in the office
and, like, you know,
you know, it was amazing.
But then, you know,
then we got back to work
because you got to see me anxious about,
like, you know, launching the thing.
Yeah.
That was a brutal
three weeks because we had to ramp up
really aggressively, and and,
I mean, we really went from, like,
we really grew 100 eggs overnight.
Like, it was. It was crazy.
And so
that was three weeks that I wrote
the hardest in my entire life.
It was it was
I was sleeping in the office, like, I,
you know, I was like,
I was given this chance.
Like, we have to basically like,
you know, utilize it to the fullest.
And it was. And we didn't charge
fees on the election market.
I don't know if you knew
that it was intentional decision
because like the most,
the KPI here is we got to show the world
that these markets work.
Yeah.
And it's done safely
and nothing bad is going to happen
and democracy is going to be totally fine.
And actually and you'll see
we're announcing a few things
with some some big news organizations
pretty soon what you'll see the shift
that's happened in culture
where like the level of embracing
that's happening with predation,
like it's now, it's
that's that's pretty nice to see this guy.
Plus South. Park.
And South. Park. Yeah.
Turkmen. Sure.
Thank you so much for,
coming to all of us.
Like, this is a lot of
fun. Thank you so much, guys.
But that's fine.
Thank you.
That's, that was our conversation
