[Music] hi everyone I'm Nicola tangan the CEO of the Norwegian soan wealth fund and today we have Thomas Shiner the CEO of rash which is one of the leading healthcare companies in the world rash was founded in 1896 so it's uh really old lots of tradition have really innovated in uh Healthcare saved millions and millions of people and we are proud that we own 2.3% of the company worth more than $6 billion so a big thanks thas for joining us today thank you very much for the invitation so Thomas when um you drive into Basel right you have uh Rush on one side of the river Novartis on the other side of the river two of the leading farma companies in the world so how come that this uh little Swiss town has grown to become one of the super centers for biofarma I think it's all in the history of that region uh starting with the chemical industry and then later moving into the farmer uh part of the industry uh so I I think it's all basically in the history of of that region and located in the center of Europe uh it's actually quite ideally located in addition it also has an ecosystem in terms of good universities um good educational system in general and I think this really attracts a lot of people around the world really talented people that then can drive the Innovation well we love it when we see these kind of um hubs of um different types of Industries now um one of the things with you are uh you know the leader in in cancer and um I read this book called The Emperor of all melodies about the incredible progress that's happened in cancer survival rates over the last 50 years could you just briefly take us through the main milestones in that development so on theology side I think one of the major breakthroughs was uh clearly the understanding of a genome if you look back uh in 2003 it costs billions to sequence one genome and took I think uh more than 10 years to sequence a single genome now you can do that within just days and it cost you hundreds uh of Swiss Franks or dollars whatever currency you're looking into so really understanding The genome was a real breakthrough and with that you could understand better the drivers uh of what actually drives cancer uh certain enogen Etc and with that you can Target much more precisely the root cause of cancer then I think the other breakthrough was uh when we found a way on how to use antibodies something that naturally occurs in our body um but to take these antibodies and Target them much more precisely at different diseases including uh cancer and uh I think cancer immunotherapies are a great example of that where you can actually activate the own immune system to fight the cancer and I think we'll go more in that direction as well uh one uh topic we're working on is the personalized cancer vacine so really in how you can even more enhance your own immune system to fight off the cancer so there are a number of steps that have been happening and on the other hand I think there's a lot of innovation that can still happen and a long way to go to really um eradicate cancer how strong is your leadership in cancer treatment now yeah we've been uh one of the leading companies uh in oncology for I would say the last two decades at least first with the acquisition of Genentech where we actually got a lot of access to this know how on how to engineer antibodies to better Target different uh cancer um you know targets um and at the same time you know we need to continue to invest in research and development oncology right now we're investing about 50% of our Global R&D budget so 50% of 13 billion into the ecology space because you know we want to continue to drive Innovation and set the next standards of care and how would you define your Market positions in in the other uh areas yeah so we are a leader in healthcare overall uh if you look at just by Revenue Raj is the second biggest Healthcare company in the world with both having Pharma and Diagnostics Under One Roof on the diagnostic side uh we're clearly the market leader and in Pharma we're the leader in a number of different spaces I think Neuroscience is one area where we're clearly the market leader hemophilia we're the market leader uh in oftalmology we're in the process of becoming the market leader uh in enology we're now uh one of the top three companies in the world in terms of uh cancer medicines so you have um on the last call you said you have 20 new products in the pipeline of which nine has been launched so when you look at that pipeline how how excited are you compared to what you have been historically yeah if you look at the last uh 10 years um or 15 years even we've launched about two new medicines uh every year and this is Quite a feat uh if you look at the fact that to develop a new medicine it takes on average around uh 13 years and from the beginning of development all the way to the launch of medicine only about one out of 10 makes it now this is not a rough specific number this is just an industry uh number so launching two every year is Quite a feat and uh and that's the rate we want to continue and if you continue that rate we'll launch 20 medicines also in in this decade now in our pipeline we have many many more uh potential medicines but there's always nutrition and so you have to work on many things to get just two out of the out of the door at the end now the big um the big thing of course of the last couple years have been the the Obesity space where you did have the opportunity to enter now you have entered uh at a late later stage just what what happened there why were you a bit late out of the boook yeah actually uh Ro was also a leader in cardiovascular metabolic diseases in the past and back in 2010 2011 we actually had one of these in kettin in our Pipeline and also chugai one of our daughter companies has developed an oral in creton now um you know as everything in life sometimes you make right decisions sometimes you don't make the right decision I think we've made a lot of very good decisions and that's why we are leader you know in areas like multiple sclerosis or hemophilia um but I would say here clearly you know we should have stayed in this space throughout this phase of the last decade um because you know uh the topic about obesity is also a topic Beyond just you know adipositas it's a topic of other diseases if you look at uh what diseases are caused by obesity cancer you know there's a higher rate of cancer in obese patients than non- obese patients if you look at uh kidney diseases if you look at different eye diseases if you look at potentially neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's so obesity really has uh influence much broader and so by tackling this uh we actually go into prevention of diseases and this is what Healthcare System want from us Healthcare System want us to move more towards the area of prevention are you surprised by how many how many problems are link to obesity no I'm I'm not surprised at all it's uh if you look at uh the global population about 50% of the world's population is obese at this stage and um so in order to tackle some of these co-morbidities we will have to tackle the topic of obesity now you're also working on um uh brain shuttle technology which allows larger molecules to enter the bloodb brain barrier what can this do so this uh will be transformative uh especially for diseases uh that happen in the brain like neurological diseases multiple sclerosis Alzheimer and Parkinson's just to name a few and uh what this technology does um it actually helps the antibody which is a big molecule to get much more easily into the brain if you take a normal medicine uh only or even less than half percent of this medicine that you inject into the body actually makes it to the brain so it's very hard to treat diseases that happen in the brain and and why is that well we have this Blood brain barrier and this bloodb brain barrier is there to protect our brain from viruses from bacteria from other things that could go into the brain and could damage our brain and uh with this brain shuttle which is a protein attached the antibody we can actually transport the antibody much more easily into the brain and with that we can treat diseases that otherwise could not be treated as effectively in fact we have an very promising Alzheimer medicine in our pipeline uh and this uh antibody actually uses exactly this uh technology and uh we hope to launch that uh by 28 29 time frame because then we can really tackle one of the big biggest problems in healthcare today now you work with a lot of different partners uh in many different areas have you done for a long period of time what what do you think is the the key to forming successful collaborations in the farma industry why are some of them successful and some of them are not yeah so we invest about 13 billion Swiss Franks every year in our research and development and with that we're actually the highest spender in terms of R&D in the industry now even though that sounds a lot and it is a lot it's only a fraction of the total money spent uh in uh Healthcare in in R&D so it's clear that if you want to be at the frontier of innovation you cannot only rely on projects that run in-house but you also actually have to tackle and uh understand uh some of these projects that are happening outside of our company so Us and other farma companies are constantly at the lookout to find very promising projects compounds that we could bring in house now if we look at our Pipeline and what we've delivered over the last 10 15 years about 50% of the molecules that we've launched the new medicines came from Raj and the other 50% came from the outside on the other hand what I mentioned in the beginning is that if you look at the whole development process it's a long process it's it's 13 years on average for the industry only one out of 10 medicines make it this is of course true for our own pipeline but it's also true for everything that you bring in from the outside so this is basically you know the risk that we have to take in order to bring great Innovation to patients that also Partnerships May Fail during this process but if you want to bring true Innovation this will not happen without taking any risks now there are some similarities between between a Pharma pipeline an an Investment Portfolio right you invest in products for the long term to generate returns now have you got a particular kind of investment philosophy at Raj to make this successful yeah so when we look uh at our portfolio and our potential new medicines we of course look at each medicine as an individual but we also look at the portfolio overall and uh similar to other Investments that you would do you do actually uh npv calculation you you calculate you know what would you have to invest and what's the potential return at the same time we look at something we call probability of success and so we have to understand you know what's the risk that we're taking in terms of technical scientific risk but what's also the Financial Risk and then when you look at the overall portfolio it has to make sense so you know you can do a number of projects that are high risk but also High Rewards but you also have to kind of combine it with uh projects uh where the certainty is higher uh again the high-risk High reward projects there's a reason why they're high risk and high rewards it's because for example in Parkinson's people have worked for decades for decades to find a new medicine it's very very difficult but if you make it of course it's a huge benefit to society but it's also a big benefit to our company if you make it so you can make individual such beds but you can't only make such beds because we also have to earn back the money in order to keep investing in R&D we can't do any good for patients if we don't uh are not able to earn back our R&D money you mentioned at the beginning your strong position in Diagnostics what are what are the advantages of having both Diagnostics and farma inhouse I think it's critical if you look at um where Healthcare is going Healthcare is is going uh to expect from us that we improve outcomes but also reduce cost of care um because we know that the healthcare budgets are limited and I think here the combination of Diagnostics and Pharma can play a big role so we believe that uh there is much more of a trend to go towards prevention stopping disease from progressing but also curing now if you want to prevent the disease you actually want to find the high-risk patients and these high-risk patients you want to treat preventively in order for them not to develop the disease so you need a good Diagnostics to find those patients to then be able to give them the right medicine if you want to stop disease progression you really have to understand the cause of that disease and uh find a very targeted treatment to make sure that you stop the progression of this disease and the same for cure for cure uh you know oftentimes there is genetic reasons or other reasons that cause a disease to happen again you need a Diagnostics to understand that in order to give the right kind of treatment um so we see this trend uh really happening over the next decades this will be even stronger and having both Diagnostics and Pharma we are better position than any other company to actually um manage to serve the needs of what the Healthcare System and What patients at the end need across the world and where does Healthcare data come in here because you were you were early in here by acquiring Foundation medicine and flaton among other things why um why is this an important space to be well Healthcare data plays a role uh clearly across the different parts uh of uh the value chain and uh it plays a big part in research and development if you want to develop a new medicine or new Diagnostics you have have a lot of data to understand um how to best Target which molecule to design Etc so the more data you have the better it is for you uh as a starting point to develop new medicines and and diagnostics at the same time I think um when it comes to treatment of patients um data plays a big role uh for example you can use um Diagnostics and understand you know the cause of disease for a number of different patients and then you can look at how these patients were treated and how these treatments worked now if you can go back and you can look at this on a bigger population level it will actually help you to decide which treatment to give for what kind of uh diagnostics for What patients so to combine that is I think very critical to be even better in treating our patients and improving their lives um and being more precise in the Diagnostics Thomas if we want to if we drill down a bit further on on Innovation um like uh uh a naive question why are some farma companies better at Innovation than others what what is it in particular that makes some companies stand out I I think one uh topic is uh culture you know um as a company I think that's something that differentiates us um we are able to recruit and retain the most talented people we have a very low turnover um in fact if you Benchmark us compared to other companies in Industry uh we are one of the best if not the best company in that aspect and given the long nature and the long cycles of our industry it's important that we have also a certain level of continuity of people working on certain projects when people keep switching between projects I think that's not uh not a very good uh thing the second piece is as a company you have to follow the science and you have to see where is their new scientific breakthrough like we did with antibodies like we're now doing with uh using artificial intelligence and using organoids um in our research and development um and then you have to jump on those you have to have the long breath for those then to become to reality um and I think that's important if you keep changing the course in a business that has such long Cycles it's actually not good for Innovation to happen what is it that sets the rush Innovation culture apart so I think one is the the culture that we have with our people which which is a very empowering culture the second piece I believe is also the unique setup that we have um we have on the farmer side actually two early research engines um one is uh jugi a company in Japan that we own the majority of another one is in the US uh called Genentech research and early development it came to us through uh the acquisition of uh Chen tank and the third one is farma research and early development it gives us three unique shots at goal to develop uh new uh medicines they all have very different cultures different approaches and when you look at Innovation it's actually helpful to have the kind of you know different approaches and not only have one one approach across how is AI going to change the way you innovate so this is actually an area where ched so gench research and early development has a huge focus on um we have an amazing team there of uh uh people who are World experts in in this area and AI plays and will play a role uh in the entire uh process process of research and and development in the early stage of research and development um for example um what what used to be done where you synthesize a lot of different molecules and then you test every molecule in Vivo so in the cell to see which one works nowadays what you would do is you take all the data that you have you uh let AI design uh among thousands and thousands of molecules those molecules that have the best attributes and then you just test a handful of different molecules um in uh invo and what that means is that we can actually be much faster we can be much more coste efficient we can test a lot more different molecules much faster and uh and with that actually bring uh medicines to patients much more quickly so if you if you do speed for instance what is it going to do to speed so we set goals for R&D uh by 40% and it doesn't mean that we are particularly bad that we have to set a goal of minus 40% it's just where we believe that the industry will be at the end of the Decades when we really Implement Ai and to end and what about costs how much cheaper will it be so costs uh our Target is to reduce it by 20% you know on the one hand we can be more effective but on the other hand we also want to do more uh so potentially we can also increase the number of Medicine that we launch every year which would be great news for patients but obviously also for our company so in addition to speed and cost what what do you think it will do with the with the final drug with the final product you come up with will that be significantly better you think yeah I I think that you should have uh a lot more Innovation happening in a much shorter period of time and if you have that you will also um obviously have better medicines uh I think what it will also do actually AI um is lot of the manual work that's being done today like uh you know writing uh study protocols like doing all the regulatory submissions which are 800 900 pages of paper if you can use AI for all of that um and of course you need to proof read and you need to make sure that everything is correct but it can massively reduce the amount of effort and we can use the time of those people not to do uh yeah manual labor but really invest the time into developing new medicines so I think there will be also shift in the kind of work that people are doing so you said that now one one out of 10 drugs make it what do you think that number will be in 10 years time well on on one hand uh you will bring up the volume right so that will be helpful um in terms of you know what exactly we will achieve uh in terms of the success rate I think you will have still a lot lot that will not succeed because ultimately you will have to test it and um you know there are a lot of attributes that have to work in order for medicine to work so but can you imagine if you just increase it by a factor of two just to go from 10% to 20% you would double the amount of medicines that are being uh uh delivered to to patients I mean that would be huge and The Game Changer what do you think will happen to cancer survival rates let's say in the next 10 years I I think it will continuously improve um and uh you know the goal is clearly uh to eradicate cancer and uh if you know you look at the time of HIV when the first medic was developed the second medicine was developed I think the the key uh of uh how to um basically achieve the fact that people don't have to die of HIV anymore was actually to combine medicines and the reason is if you use one medicine um you the the virus will change will have different mutations so it will escape that medicine so by combining multiple medicines you uh you know it's much much harder for this this virus to escape and it's the same for cancer for cancer you know when you put a selective pressure on it by adding a medicine you know the cells that are you know uh affected by this medicine they will die but if there are certain mutations they will escape the mechanism and they will find a different mechanism and that's what exactly we see with cancer and so by applying multiple uh medicines you can probably at one stage get to the same situation as as we've done with uh infectious uh diseases like HIV and I believe the immune system will play a big role you know if we can activate the immune system to fight the cancer to identify the cancer better um then I think we also will make a big step forward moving on to um Europe's uh place in the world here so Europe is falling behind uh China and the US when it comes to uh to clinical drug trials and I think the European share has Haled over the last 10 years which is pretty pretty dramatic what why is that yeah I mean if you look at Innovation um I I would say there are probably four area regions in the world where Innovation is uh really coming from uh one is the US one is uh uh Europe China is really accelerating if you look at the patent applications coming out of China it's taking over it's it's advancing very quickly and the last area is is Japan now what uh the US is doing quite well is um so all of them have pretty strong Academia I would say um but what the US is doing particularly well is that uh they have a much better environment for startups so there is a much better access to venture capital and with that you have a lot of people actually moving to the US so they have a lot of talent going to the US and uh and you see a lot of the Innovation which is translated from Academia into the biotechs than actually happen more in the US and probably also China now than than for example in Europe um so I think Europe has to get that right the second piece that Europe has to get right is uh they have to reduce the amount of bureaucracy if you look at clinical trials Etc um these are done in countries where um you have less bureaucracy if it takes you a year for from the time you apply for clinical trial to uh being able to start a clinical trial that's a year of lost time a year of time where we cannot save a number of patients lives if this medicine makes it um so I think Europe really needs to work on on the bureaucracy piece as well what particular part of bureaucracy is holding you back is it g is are these gdpr related uh issues or what are they gdpr related issues uh but uh in in general you know all the approvals that you have to get to start a clinical trial um if that takes a year it's just a year lost in time you said China was um taking over here what could you be a bit more specific about China's role yeah so looking in China um first if you look at the amount of patn uh that are coming out of China this is going up exponentially um if you look at the talents that you can find in China uh you I mean it's just amazing you have a lot of people that studied in the best universities in the world that have gone back to China and uh have opened biotechs uh are working in universities uh Etc and um one has to say you know if you look at uh the mentality in China is you know they want to be a leader and then they put all the efforts all the strength of the country of the people behind it to become a leader I think sometimes if you look at uh uh regions and I'm just going to pick Europe because I'm a European so it's always easier to pick on yourself um you know maybe sometimes we've become too comfortable I would say the prosperity that we have is sometimes also a bit of our enemy you know if you want to stay ahead um you cannot rest on the achievements from the past but you constantly have to work at that and I think this is where China has a different attitude to which extent can you tap into the talent in China so uh China is actually one of our biggest countries in terms of number of people we have there and also in terms of uh um uh you know markets uh sales Etc but beyond that we don't only have commercial organizations there over the past years and partly decades we've built up also a presence on the research and and development side Pharma has been there for a bit longer but also in Diagnostics we've been there for the last couple of years um and it's important because um you know first of all we want to tap into the talent that is there and second if you have strong R&D presence you also can tap more much more easily into the biotex because you know you have the connectivity um you speak the same language uh you can you know only assess the science outside if you have great scientists inside um and so I think from that aspect I think we're in in a pretty good shape and clearly China is going to and will remain a big priority for us simply also because uh there are 1.4 billion people in China and a lot of these people still don't have great access to to healthare and so there's a lot of work that can still be done are you acquiring patents and companies in China so we've uh done a couple of Licensing deals from biotechs where we licensed in a number of molecules and I have to say the science is great is it better now than in the US you think I I I wouldn't say that at this stage uh I would say you know if you look at uh you know around the globe us Europe China and Japan are where most of the Innovation is coming from us is clearly I still in the leadership position but China is catching up very quickly moving on to the uh important uh topic of uh pricing um of course there's always been a trade-off in the farma industry about uh you know how much you charge and how many people will benefit from It generally are drug prices too high now across the world well if you look at uh pricing you also have to look at the model uh of how Innovation happens uh as I mentioned uh you have in Pharma uh cycle of about 13 years to develop a new medicine um and you have a risk profile where only one out of 10 medicines make it so you actually have to earn the money back uh with one medicine that you couldn't with the other nine that failed and you only have a short period of time you only have around 10 years and in some parts of the world this time is shortening even um 10 years to earn back the money and then you have the entry of biosimilar you have the entry of generics so the benefit to society is of course already during these 10 years when you have uh launched this medicine but the benefit to society goes Way Beyond if you look at if you look at uh just the medicines that we have launched uh in our history Now 44 medicines are now on the wh list of essential medicines like antibiotics like volume um uh you know a number of other cancer medicines Etc now if the Innovation didn't happen before because there were no incentives for Innovation then these medicines would not be as widely available uh as they are today in fact I always say that um our industry is actually the pipeline of the generics and biosimilar Industry so if you break that it doesn't work I think a good example uh where you can see where if you don't have that incentive and it doesn't work is antibiotics so there haven't been new antibiotics for 50 years now we've been uh developing antibiotics to antibiotics because we see it as an ethical responsibility and we believe that unfortunately there will be more pandemics that will come and unfortunately one of the pandemics that could come could be a bacterial pandemic and then the vaccines will not work then we need new new antibiotics but why is no one especially not a lot of biotechs why is no one working on this it's because the business model doesn't work if you know you have a company developing a new antibiotic what would happen is that antibiotic would not be used it would only be used once all the other antibiotics fail so there is not a huge incentive for biotechs to go in it they have to survive they have to survive a company like ours we can invest a certain piece of our money uh that we have in research and development to do this but biotechs cannot and unfortunately a lot of innovation happens in biotechs so you need to create more of an incentive system for this Innovation to happen so in in conclusion if we break the incentive system then uh we will be uh a situation there will be no more progress in terms of innovation and that's why I think it's important to understand the full context when you think about pricing when you think about pricing in um less developed markets and the ethical aspects around that do you take a different approach than other farma companies we and I think many other Pharma companies actually have differential pricing yeah differential pricing uh means that based on also you know how well the medicine works on one hand but also what's the affordability you try to price it in a fair way and that means that richer countries will have to pay a little bit more on the medicine than poorer countries and I think this has to be this kind of contract between richer countries and and poorer countries now if you have you know certain politicians that want basically the best price in the world which is in let's say a country in Africa the danger is that a lot of Pharma companies will say well if I have to give to developed countries like in Europe or the US I have to give the same price as a country in Africa I cannot introduce it in Africa so I think there has to be an understanding that we have differential pricing between the different parts of the world and you can't have world leaders asking for the same price as in some country in Africa or in Latin America so now you'll um uh five year hence you will have reduced your R&D cost by 20% you have reduced the time frame by 40% and instead of 1 out of 10 you know have one out of five succeeding right will that mean lower costs for patients well I think that um again you have to look at the total impacts that you have now if you if you uh go to a situation a where you prevent diseases from happening then maybe that one medicine costs more but the total costs because you don't have to give this medicine for the next 10 15 20 years goes down or you have less treatments in hospitals because people get less sick Etc so I think you have to look at uh it's not as simple as saying you know each each medicine but you have to look at the total impact on the healthcare system and it's clear and that's our commitment we want to help improve the outcome for patients but we also want to reduce the costs in the healthcare system and we have to reduce it by going more towards prevention by going towards treating people less in the hospital but more in the home setting um because you know if people constantly go to the hospital that also drives cost in the system um plus you know people who are sick also don't want to be confronted with their disease all the time so they they actually don't want to go to the hospital so I think if we can get that done we can bring down the cost in the Healthcare System overall moving on to leadership you've been the CEO of rush for a bit more than a year what's the most fun part being the CEO of Rush yeah so I've been with Ros for now 21 years and uh you know I love this company I love the culture in this company and I love the purpose uh of of our company and and uh you know if you can see the kind of innovation that we're working on it's just uh amazing and you know you can see the impact that you can have on patients lives I mean when when I talk to uh some of our uh researchers and medical doctors you know when we run a clinical trial that sometimes takes 3 to four years in the phase three and then the day when they see the results and they see that the results are positive and what impact they can have on patients lives you you have people that have tears in their eyes because they see the kind of impact they they can have and um so I think that's just amazing um you know to work on something like this the second piece is and maybe that's also why I've been with the company for 21 years I really care about the people in our organization and for me it's fun to work with these people it's fun also you know to develop leaders to see them grow I think that's also something that is very fulfilling for me so those are things that I really enjoy and that I can do even more in the role that I'm in right now what's the biggest difference between you and S Schwan who was your predecessor so I've been working closely with him over the last uh four or five years when I was Diagnostics CEO I would say two things that I see one is he studied finance and law and I'm a scientist so you got a PhD in biology I have a PhD in molecular biology and did uh research uh in the area of cancer oncology uh I think that's one element the second piece is um you know if you look at where I lived and grew up in my life um I was born in Germany but with the age of nine my parents moved to Singapore to Asia and and this is where I grew up I lived in total of 12 Years in Asia I went to the US to study and and work in the US so it's something that I really enjoyed working in so many different cultures and I would say those are two elements uh that are probably a bit different what did you take away from your upbringing in Asia well first of all uh Singapore is at the Equator so I I loved the warm weather and I loved the food the chili crab for example uh dim Zam you know you name it uh I I just love uh Asian food to the point where you know every time we go eat in Switzerland I always say let's go eat Asian and my family is uh not so happy about that because I would go eat Asian every day no but beyond that I think you can learn something from every every culture um clearly in Singapore the work attitude right I mean they have a very strong work attitude if you look at the us uh the approach to Innovation I think the culture is more extroverted than some of the Asian cultures and I think it helps me in the role that I'm in because uh I work with people from all kind of different parts of the world and uh what what I've always seen and what I've realized is you know in certain culture like the German or the Dutch culture people tell you directly what the problem is in other cultures sometimes you have to read a little bit between the lines so to to I think one of the things is this cultural sensitivity to really understand uh the other side that you're talking to and uh I think it just helps me really working with uh the different regions in the world people with uh phds are often less uh have less risk appetite are you where are you on the risk-seeking scale I I haven't heard that theory but I would say I think without taking risks you cannot be successful you know in anything in life to be successful you have to step out of your comfort zone um and how do you make decisions are you are you an intuitive decision maker or are you basing everything on analysis again you probably have to have a balance um I like to understand the data and I like to understand the problem I think often times um when people don't try to fully understand what the problem is they they come up with solutions that don't work um you can only get to the right Solutions and and topics that make life of everyone easier in a company if if you first fully understand the problem and then what for me is important is to have sparring partners to understand the different perspectives uh on the data um and uh I think that's important to come to decision um because uh you may have one perspective and other people have different perspectives so to really fully understand that but at the same time you have to also get to a point where you then quickly make a decision you know often times people just spin along on the data and then never get to the decision now one of the things I often do also is I talk to the different experts now it depends is it decision I have to make or is it someone else in the organization and has to make a decision but if it's my decision to make I try to talk to different experts and I try to understand you know does their View and their decision conform with what I believe if that happens I think that often times these are probably the easier decisions right if I see that everyone else is a different opinion oh then I must be wrong and but often times it's something in between you know where you have different then I know it's a difficult problem right when you know you have very different opinions and then at one point in time you have to make uh B based on the facts based on um the information that you have you have to make the decision um and you have to go forward and you know often times you know you have to hope that decision is right but there may be times when your decision is wrong some people you can talk to are CEOs in other companies who have been educated at rush you have Co B Marine uh buyer astroica uh now why has Ros been so successful in in developing leaders I think on the one hand it's clearly a sign that we have a good culture and uh on the other hand it shows um that we have been very good in hiring great people and developing those people so I think this uh ability to develop people and have a strong focus on people is what drives a lot of uh you know uh Innovation and also good decision- making because at the end Innovation is also based on good decision- making so you know investing in people I think is something very critical and it's not something that we've just done over the last couple of years it's something that we've done for a very very long period of time and that's how you build a strong base of strong talents in the organization you said you'd been at uh Raj for 21 years and if we take the last three CEOs they have been there for an average of 15 years as CEOs now you look at the S&P 500 the average time is 5 years so uh incredible incredible length of of service what are the what are the kind of the pros and cons of that so if you look at uh the fact that we are 127 years old it shows you you know that we've been quite successful uh with this kind of uh model um what the benefit is is clearly um that given the fact that we have a very long cycle of uh development of you know 13 years on average you also have to have a long breath you can't uh change direction every one two or three years because actually then nothing will happen uh in this industry um you have to have determination you have to have stamina you have to have resilience because you will have Z bags um but at the same time you need to be open to change um and uh Drive change forward and uh be also very performance oriented um so clearly The Long View is important but also during this Long View you have to deliver and uh you know if you look at just the last quarters where we had very significant growth of 9% each quarter I think we also deliver in the short term it's not only just longterm and weights we will deliver in the long term no for us it's very clear that you also have to deliver on the short term what are the advantages of having uh family backing so the Raj family and the the Hoffman Family have the majority of the Voting Rights in the company what are the what kind of advantages does that give you yeah this long-term thinking you know if you um constantly change direction in a company first of all of this size I mean to change direction of a company of more than 100,000 people also takes a bit of time um uh and then you look at the long cycle of of innovation that we need so this uh long-term thinking I think is is very critical a part again with the in short-term performance and uh the structure we have is really beneficial for that some personal things um Thomas being a head of the uh an incredible farmer company do you live a very healthy life well uh I try uh for sure um of course uh I think it's also important because a job like this is quite intense in terms of the amount of time that you work etc so uh being in a healthy uh space is critical to actually deliver performance what do you eat for instance uh extremely healthy you know um right now over the last couple of years um so at home we hardly eat any carbohydrates uh we eat quite a little amount of meat Etc so uh but I have to admit it's more my wife than myself so you know sometimes when I I'm on a business trip I can escape that a little bit but when I'm at home I can't Sports I love sports uh but uh you know age is catching up with me you know I I love soccer I I used to play when I was a child and I love squash squash uh I guess that has to do with the fact that I grew up in Asia and squash is a big thing in Asia and if you look at the amount of running and calories that you burn actually squash is one of the best sports you can do I don't think you can say that age is catching up you you're only 49 it's super young yeah but you know I see it I see it when I play soccer now with my son and and other friends uh 10 years ago you know I could keep up right now I have to say you know playing with 30y olds becomes quite difficult for me you know sometimes my head knows what to do but my body doesn't uh catch up with my head so you have a slogan in rash um that you cure medicines so that people can spend more time with the people they love how do you spend uh your time with the people you love yeah so basically 90% plus of my free time I spend uh with my family and with my three kids um the kids you know we go hiking we go do Sports uh uh also enjoy going on holiday uh with them um we go once a year we go um it's mostly Easter we go somewhere into the sun because you know after Long Winter we need to recover and really get energy from the Sun so we do that uh and and I really like that I guess it also has to do with the fact that I grew up at the equator that I really long for uh warmth and and Sun after Long Winter what do you read um so being being a a science geek I guess uh I love reading uh Lots on science um you know actually still read uh Publications uh because I just find it very fascinating um and it keeps me up to speed on what's happening on the science side um that's why I also love having conversations with Scientists because uh I learned something uh all the time um so I like that uh you know I spend a lot of time you know reading up on uh you know politics uh also history things like that I really enjoy reading those things what is your advice to young people yeah so having three kids uh I guess I have to give uh advice quite a lot uh to my children um you know one of the things that that I tell them is uh you know what happens in social media is not the real world the real world can actually be quite exciting and people should spend more time in in the real world um and you know oftentimes what you see in social media is just also not completely true the other thing I tell them is uh you know there are no shortcuts in life if you want to achieve something the only way to achieve it is through hard work there is no other way than to achieve things than other than through hard work and uh and I think that's important for people uh and the younger Generations also to realize well sounds like you work really really hard big thanks for uh for being on the podcast big thanks for curing all the diseases and uh please uh keep up all the good work in bastel thank you very much for the conversation [Music]
