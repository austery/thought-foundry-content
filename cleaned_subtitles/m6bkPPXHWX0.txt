I think movies play the role in our culture that myths and legends used to play in ancient cultures or that novels used to play 100 years ago. They're the art form that that is capable of basically containing and expressing and making permanent the most important aspects of a culture uh or of a civilization.
>> There were a lot of great films in 2019 and then like just a memory hole of like what great film has come out since then. like something happened in Hollywood. The scripts that are being written, the types of things that are being made today are very very different than what was happening in 2018, 2019.
>> Mark, you've been known to monitor a situation or two. Uh, welcome to the program,
>> Eric. How would you characterize me as a situation monitorer?
>> Extremely eager. Uh, you know, you know, I picture you with Yeah. Thorough. I I picture you with security cameras uh just extensively monitoring, you know,
>> at all hours of the night. Um
>> advance.
>> So basically Howard Katherine Howard Hughes in the penthouse is up there.
>> Yeah.
>> Um
>> you're an elite situation monitor, which is why you're here. We're we're so happy to have you.
>> Well, speaking of movies, I'm watching all the James Bond movies with with my my 10-year-old, and we just got to live and let D No, which one? Diamonds Are Forever, which is the one set in Las Vegas. And it turns out the producer Harry Saltzman of the Bond movies was a close personal friend of Howard Hughes at the time. So they set the movie in Vegas and had all this cooperation from Hughes and there's actually Hughes character in the movie. Um but I'm just going to give a spoiler alert. Uh the Blofeld has kidnapped Hughes and is holding him hostage um and has sort of substituted in and is is pretending to be Hughes. And uh Jace Bond scales the side of Hughes's big casino uh in Vegas at the time and drops down through the skylight um into uh essentially Howard Hughes's bathroom. Um, and the bathroom is literally set up with like monitors and like, you know, computers and like typewriters and like, you know, an elaborate phone system. Um, and then a single golden roll of toilet paper. And B drops into it and he's like, hm. And I was like, that's the perfect bathroom. Our uh our new media team has a a Twitter group chat called monitoring the situation where every that's that's the room that we they want in the office for for Exactly. All the things happening on Twitter. Um with that let's segue.
>> And did they ask for it to be the bathroom? Is that was that part of it?
>> Yeah, that be the next evolution.
>> Would that just be an added an add-on an add-on feature?
>> Yes.
>> Okay. All right. Let's proceed.
>> Mark, uh not that many pe not everybody knows this about you, but you are extensive movie buff. uh and movie afficionado and you've been having some commentary in our group chats lately over some films that you think are are worth watching right now and and kind of broader commentary around what's uh what's been happening in uh in in film. So why don't why don't you share that with us?
>> Yeah. So let me start by saying you know kind of why why start by saying like why this topic matters. Um and so um you know because like I think this does matter a lot. So, um, so first of all, I'll say like I've got like enormous respect for anybody who does anything creative. And so, like every time I see a movie, I'm just kind of marveling. Like I know what it takes to make one. It's like making a, you know, making a tech startup or something. It's just like this incredible labor of love and effort and blood, sweat, and tears in everybody's part. And so, and it's just like a minor miracle, I think, whenever any of these things actually, you know, show up as a as a as a two-hour executed film. Um, and so, and I I think that's amazing. Um, and so, you know, none of what we're about to talk about, you know, should be considered a knock on on on filmmakers per se or the people who put all this work into it. Um, and then the other thing I say is look, in the last, you know, whatever five years, decade, 20 years, there have been a tremendous number of what you could call entertain, you know, highly entertaining movies, right? And, and some that I think are like jaw-dropping, right? So, like, you know, like the you know, just my, you know, one of my favorite genres, action, you know, the John Wick movies are like, you know, the best action movies of all time. They're all on the last whatever 15 years. They're, you know, you could you could name that for a lot of different kinds of movies. you know the the the sort of uh you know the entertainment factor is you know remains very high. Um having said that you know I think movies and Katherine I see if you agree with me on this or not. Um I think movies play the role in our culture um that myths and legends um used to play in ancient cultures or that novels uh maybe used to play you know 100 years ago um or that um you know uh you know uh maybe songs used to play or something like that. um which is basically they're the art form that that is capable of basically um containing and expressing and making permanent um the most important aspects of a culture uh or of a civilization. Right? So, so sometimes you'll hear the term like there's this term called the great American novel and there you know this idea there are these certain novels like the great Gatsby or whatever that like or to kill a mocking bird that kind of capture the spirit of a times and kind of become immortal through doing that and and I think you know basically and I love novels but like you know that the idea that novels do that I think is probably at this point you know pretty unlikely for a variety of reasons we could have a whole separate podcast on that u but for the last let's say at least 60 years and probably 100 years like mo movies have been the way that that that that our culture that our culture is able to express itself in a way that is going to really deeply stand the test of time where people 100 and 200 and 500 years from now are going to look back and kind of say this is what these people are about. By the way, Katherine, would you agree with that?
>> Yeah. No, no, definitely. I mean, I think uh I I think it was I think in slow decline probably the last 25 years um because fewer like you know probably the 90s was the like the last decade where everyone watched the same movies and the Oscars were indicative of like what's a great film that everyone has to see. I would love to hear when you think it started bifurcating, but it does feel like there's been this sort of bifurcation of if, you know, maybe you could say the Tarantino films of the last 20 years were were widely watched and mattered in cinematic lore, but like it it feels like there was a lot more um to say to say it's like the next great American novel is actually the next great American movie. That feels like that maybe that ended in the '90s.
>> Yeah. So, it's it's possible. Um although you could also say you know it is interesting because as we've discussed in other other other forums it's not that there aren't cultural artifacts that everybody participates in like you know everybody that you know that I am told there's this young lady named Taylor Swift who is apparently extremely popular and I am told that other than me everybody follows her with a great deal of of of of avid attention and I'm told that she has a new I guess what album and movie and
>> album was that album? Yeah, there's a movie there's a new movie coming out too, I think. Right. I I believe
>> I just remember I remember her breakthrough. She actually her first movie um was the movie a couple years ago that came out that was so popular. Her movie
>> she had a a like a a thing on Netflix that was sort of following her around the the kind of
>> Okay. So, okay. Here's something I know about Taylor Swift that you don't which is the only time in my life I'm going to be able to utter those words. Um she she did a famous thing actually Hollywood in the movie industry. She actually she released I think that I think whatever that was u she released that actually in the theaters um and it was actually very significant that she did that because she cut the deal directly with the theater owners um and I think it was a straight 50/50 revenue split with the theater owners and so and she she booked it directly and it was like on like it was like a huge release was like on 4,000 screens and it was like extremely popular and like all you know a lot of you know Taylor Swift fans and a lot of you families with young girls like you know went to see it and I I remember it at the time because it was the same it it it it went big the same week that Martin Scaresy's movie uh Killers in the Flower Moon um uh was in theaters and if you remember the reviews and Martin Scazes is one of these filmmakers who's made these mythical movies you know that will for sure stand the test of time and so you know Killers of the Flower Moon was a movie that he intended to do that and we you know I don't I don't think it it did and we could talk about why not but it was this movie about you know was a period piece set in the 1920s about you know basically the rape and pillillage of Native American you know re you basically natural resources by you know evil white people and but it was a three-hour movie um and It was appar I didn't see it but apparently it was extremely slow and then apparently it had these extremely long stretches of of silence because he was trying to get across this sense of like awe and grandeur and like emotional impact and apparently what would happen is that movie would be playing adjacent to the Taylor Swift movie and the Taylor Swift movie was so loud that whatever he would go to the silent part you would just hear Taylor Swift pounding away on stage. Um,
>> probably helps the movie out. Probably a little bit
>> arguably arguably improved the movie from from from what I heard, you know, filled in the missing soundtrack. So anyway, there are still mechanical issues uh with with reproduction of these things. But um how did I get on that? Um so anyway, the point is there are, you know, there there are these things, you know, there are we do have cultural artifacts that sort of have, you know, almost universal, you know, attention. It's just a to me it's just a question of like okay like where are the what like say true art like with a capital A is the thing that not only captures the popular imagination like not only that people really experience but also is the thing that actually has the lasting impact such that in 10 years and 20 years and 50 years and 100 years like people are still discussing it and is it and then you know maybe a couple things you could you could say one is like as time passes the sort of most important c cultural artifacts are sort of continuously reinterpreted right and so the the way that comes across when it's released is not the same way that comes across 5 or 10 years later and then 20 years later and then sort of each new generation that discovers it, you know, maybe interprets it and talks about it in a different way. Um and then um yeah and then and then so basically like capital A art is is the ability to do that. And so like I I like for sure it's true that the audience overall has fragmented. For sure it's true that like the internet you know has like you know created you know is sucking away you know just enormous amounts of time and attention uh from movies. Um, you know, it's it's certainly true that um, you know, the business pressures in Hollywood, which we can talk about, are, you know, are probably more intense than ever, but it is but it is still true that I think it is still possible to do what we're describing. And and, you know, we we'll talk about this more, but I think we we'd all agree Tarantino, you know, was able to do this with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, not that recently. So, anyway, maybe I can say I still hold out hope this is possible. Um, like I I think this is a thing that that that the best filmmakers in the world, uh, in the country really ought to be able to do. Would you would you agree with that or do you think it's Do you think that's that's too optimistic?
>> I hope. I mean, I I I think I'm a little more pessimistic than you that I I do think Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is the last American movie, but for different reasons probably like I think not only what you know, it's like again like Tarantino is, you know, this I think he has one more film in him as he says, but that was really his his final opus, right? Like the penultimate film is the the that that was what he had been kind of moving towards and I think he said his last film is going to be a much kind of scaled down smaller sort of film when he decides to do it. But like I I think there's something about 2019 in particular. There were so many great films in 2019. There was 1917. Uh Parasite won the Oscar. Stole it from Once Upon a Time in Hollywood in my opinion, but still was like a decent film. Like there were a lot of great films in 2019. And then like just a memory hole of like what great film has come out since then. like I I some something happened with COVID where we stopped going to the theater and it does kind of map to that you know no one goes to the theater anymore but it's also like something happened in Hollywood which I know we want to get your take on what happened in Hollywood because it does feel like there
>> you know the the scripts that are being written the the types of things that are being made today are very very different than what was happening in 2018 2019
>> yeah so just spend a moment let's spend a moment on the state of Hollywood sort of for people who don't track it and so there's a bunch of things so yeah look the the theater business has obviously taken a giant hit kind of in the wake of co you know co was like this big, you know, was this big step down, you know, because the theaters, you know, were closed along with everything else. And then there there was this there's been this question ever since of kind of how to re-engage those audiences and get them to go back to the theater and, you know, that, you know, maybe that's just a secular change that goes with people being on their phones or whatever. You know, having said that, it's not quite, you know, I don't think a complete explanation for what's happened to the art form and and the reason for that is that the the length of time that it takes to actually make a movie. Um, right. And so the movies that showed up in the theater in 2019 got green lit in, you know, call it 2015 or 2016. you know, they got staffed in 2016, 2017, and then they got executed in like 20, you know, basically 2017, 2018. Um, and and then they went through, you know, editing and post-production and so forth. And, you know, for for big movies, that's, you know, that whole process is like a two-year process. Um, and then and then there's the long run up to release with the marketing campaign and, you know, all the, you know, put the actors on the road and and do all the stuff. And so there's like a whatever a fourmonth ad campaign or whatever. And so, you know, by the time you go through that process, you know, start to end, it's like four or five years. And so for once upon a time to show I don't know exactly when it was green lit, but for it to for when it to for it to show up in 2019 meant that basically it the the the making of it the backstory probably starts you know no no later than 2015. Um and and I just bring that up which means the movies that hit the theaters in 2021 started in like 2017, right? And the movies that are showing up today started in 2020, right? And so so the the the co explanation is not sufficient for what we've seen in the last 5 years because those movies weren't green lit under conditions of co those movies were green lit under conditions of pre-COVID. Um and so what whatever changes have taken place um which which we can talk about um I think start you know probably started around 2015
>> and and what is your theory around why things really started changing in the 2020 decade of film.
>> Yeah. So again let me let me give you know again sort of maximum maximum you know kind of uh you know kind of respect here which is like there's no question a couple things. So just the secular changes. So one thing is look the streaming revolution has had a very big impact and and the streaming revolution hit Hollywood incredibly hard very positively for a stretch basically through the 2010s because the all the companies that were engaged in the streaming wars started spending just unprecedented amounts of money on on on televisions and shows of all on shows and movies of all kinds and so there was just a giant flood of money and I would say the mood in Hollywood I don't know whatever eight years ago or something six years ago was you might even describe as euphoric from a business standpoint just because like I mean the big thing was when Netflix scaled up to the point where they were spending $20 billion a year on on on content, which is just like this, you know, this giant budget and everybody else. They were like, you know, whatever, a dozen streaming companies or whatever, all the different platforms that wanted to compete. Um, and and so that money kind of took off like a rocket. And then what's happened is as the streaming as the streamers are consolidating, as the streaming wars are are kind of rationalizing, that money got pulled back. Um, that was a big, you know, kind of financial blow. And then the other thing that streaming did that has really affected things a lot in in Hollywood in a very negative way, which is, uh, streaming cut off the financial upside. um to the to to films and TV. And so uh films used to when they were hits they they first they would sell a lot of box office um and then they would and then they would sell like the television rights or you know you know ultimately the streaming rights and then and then they'd had this long aftermarket where they would you know sell DVDs uh you know videotape rentals in the 80s 90s and then DVDs in the 2000s and 2010s and so if you had a movie that was a hit like it could run and you know it could run for years generating just like enormous amounts of of of revenue and cash. Um, and then same thing with TV shows. You know, it used to be a successful TV show. The line I think was six seasons in a movie where if it got to like whatever hundred episodes or something, it would enter syndication and then you could sell it for hundreds of millions of dollars and there would be all this upside for the people involved in creating it. And what happened with streaming on the economics of streaming is those those forms of upside just vanished because what happens is the streamers just buy the projects with like a cost plus model a lot of the time. Um, and so you make the movie and you turn around, you sell it for like a 10% profit margin uh to a streamer. Uh, and then there's no aftermarket because it's just a tile on the streaming service, right? And and and there's no, you know, there's no DVD sales, there's no, you know, there's no TV syndication rights. Those concepts are irrelevant. You know, the streamer just has sort of a perpetual ride or a 20-year ride or whatever to be able to show at that sort of fixed fee. Um and so so the upside got cut off and that that removed I think a lot of the economic incentive for kind of the wildcatting thing that Hollywood used to do more which is to really take you know take these chances um on things you know like Hollywood used to work a lot like the venture capital model which is you know you you you put 10 you know you put 10 10 lines in the water you get you know you get four bites and you get maybe one you grand slam um and and you know if it works like that's a spectacular model but you the grand slam has to be able to scale economically in order for that that to happen and that's been cut off. So, so, so that that that did not help. And then, and then there's the big thing, um, capital B, capital G, u, capital T, the big thing that happened, of course, which is Hollywood being on the vanguard of culture got hit by the thing, um, the cultural change of the last decade, like incredibly hard. And, you know, we've we've talked a lot about how tech, you know, got hit by that incredibly hard. Um, and Hollywood got hit by it in a in a very intense way. Um, you know, nobody's ever quite figured out the right way to to talk about this. Uh, to, you know, say some, you know, sometimes you say things like wokeness or or whatever. Um, you know, in the 60s they would have called it the new left. Um, there there's actually a term there's actually my my favorite term for in Hollywood is there's a YouTube channel called critical drinker uh where he's a uh he's a movie reviewer um uh is is quite funny and and the critical drinker has been documenting basically the thing uh that hit Hollywood and he and in in I say in quite scathing terms um this whole time. Um, and what he calls it is he calls it the message. Um, and it's right, it's the message with a capital M. But it's actually really funny because for a long time people who watch the critical drinker, he would never actually define what the message was. You know, he would basically just say, you know, this this this movie has been affected by the message, right? And of course, and you you guys are both laughing because of course you already know what the message was. Everybody knows the message was, right? All white people are racist. All men are, you know, sexist. You know, everybody's a transphobe. And you you you just go America's, you know, a force for evil in the world, right? and you just go like right down the list of like everything that you know everything that you would expect you know from the last decade um you know America's you know incipient fash fascist regime like just the entire package you know basically you know like whatever's on the front page of the New York Times that day right just the message um and so you know movies transform themselves you know very large percentage of movies that could have been great you know you know you know in some alternate world could have been these these these these great works of art just just basically became became in some form political propaganda Uh or or you could if you wanted to be more generous you could say that you know those will be the lasting artifacts of this last decade right which is historians will look back and they'll be like holy you know holy lord like these people were really like wrapped around the axle on like a bunch of political issues like my my you know my goodness um and so they got hit hard by that and then the other and then that that led to in Hollywood you know what can only be described as a reign of terror um which and and this is something that occasionally Hollywood figures will talk about this in public although very rarely because they you know it's it's a very sensitive topic still but um you know if if you know people in Hollywood you know basically is through that through the especially the last you know eight years you know they they just they felt like if they made one misstep on you know casting or on this details in the script or use of words or the themes of a movie or anything you know they they just felt like they were in danger of just like a lightning strike from you know from from you know from from the sky just like striking them dead on the spot like you know and they they they had like friends you know everybody in Hollywood had like friends whose careers just got like completely detonated you know, at one point, you know, in one unpredictable way or another. Um, and and again, people have different opinions on this and you could argue it was it was long needed or whatever, but like it it became it became a thing and it like it basically changed the process of like how projects were selected. It changed the pro changed the process of, you know, who made projects. It changed the process of staffing. It changed the process of screenwriting. It changed it changed changed acting. It it changed, you know, aesthetics. It it changed like almost every aspect of of of how these projects get executed. But and I just go go through that because um I I think that that I think that's that's changing again right now. Like if you talk to the same people in Hollywood, what they'll tell you basically is, you know, it's basically this year um that that the fever has broken. Um and there's a bunch of indications for that and and we're entering kind of the the sort of post sort of post message uh um uh you know, kind of era. Um and you know, we don't know what era we're heading into. Maybe there's a new message or something, but like we're we're we're we're there's a phase shift that's underway. Um but but that phase shift is going to take time because it takes time to make movies, right? The movies that are green lit today, right, are not going to come out, you know, until like whatever 20 like 2027, 2028 soonest. And so we we we so we're in this like liinal period or this inter interstitial period where for the next like 3 years we're going to get like a thousand movies that have like the message and they're all going to act like the message is like brand new and fresh and nobody's ever heard it before cuz they, you know, they all pretend that this is like some big revelation that like all white people are racist, right? Um like in every movie. Um and there's going to be like a thousand more of those in the next three years and they're just going to land like an absolute thud, right? Like cuz it's just like if you wanted that message, you got it, right? You already saw a thousand movies to set you like the next thousand movies don't contribute to that, right? And and just just to knock on one and he's a brilliant filmmaker, but I I just saw the new Paul Thomas Anderson movie um one battle after another and it like it's literally like a time capsule. It's like a 2022 time capsule. It's literally like time frozen 2022. Um, and in 2022, this movie would have been like, "Oh my god, like this movie is like got the message, right? It's just like everything about it." We could we could spend hours just on this movie. Um, and it lands today and you're just watching, you're just like, "Wow, that was a weird time." Like, oh my goodness.
>> I want to talk more about this movie because, uh, I think it was Brett Een Ellis who came out and was the first person, you know, because it's getting all the Oscar plot. It's like, oh, it's it's definitely in line for the Oscar, right? And he came out, he's like, it feels musty, right? Okay. And I I should get the actual like language he used because it was much worse than that. But he said it's like a musty film. It's exactly what you said. It's 2022. Like this was green lit at a very different time and now it's come out and like the world's moved on. And so I'm I'm curious like do you think that that that we're still going to pretend these movies are great even though they don't match with our time or is there going to be sort of a three-year period where we are allowed to say actually like that that doesn't make any sense anymore and like maybe that movie shouldn't have been made.
>> Yeah. So this is it's a it's this one is a complicated this is a complicated scenario. So just on the movie itself, um the movie itself is actually and it's it's quite like I quite enjoyed watching it. I quite enjoyed watching it not just for ironic reasons, but just also watching it of like how how this happened. uh like and and and there's a bunch bunch of reasons and you know and again the filmmakers one of one of the you know one of the great filmmakers of the era Paul Thomas Anderson you know he made there will be blood and he made you know um um Boogie Knights and like all these you know by the way he made right there was named two movies Boogie Nights and there Will Be Blood are two movies that are like in the in the they're going to be in the Hall of Fame of the art form where it's like you know 100 years from now people are going to be like wow you know that's what that culture was about. Um and so he he's he's he is one of those guys and clearly that's what he was going for in this movie. It is a weird movie in that it's it's it's partially based on a famous Thomas Pinchin novel called Vineland. um which is Thomas Pinchin's movie uh is Thomas Pinchin's novel basically about the the it's essentially I mean it's essentially veiled through whatever but it's basically like about the days of rage um you know the Brian Burough book or the you know the weather underground you know bas basically the the violent social revolution um you know basically from the far left in the 60s and and then sort of what happened in the aftermath of that um and so like that that that's the theme of the novel but it's it's very much a novel of and about the 1960s it's not considered you know most people don't consider it maybe the the best pinchion novel but like it's it's a mid tier one and it's it's in the pantheon and it it turns out it had been Paul Thomas Anderson's favorite novel. he'd been trying to make a version of it for 20 years or whatever. And but what he did basically was he he kept the he kept the very basic kind of plot framework setup, but then he completely updated it for the message, right? And so like it has like specifically it has a whole bunch of but like it has this whole basically it's a racial, you know, it has a whole racial kind of plot structure to the whole thing. Um and and and sexual in ways that are fairly amazing. Um uh but that are completely based on the current moment of you know circa 2022. Um, and so it's a little bit like the 1960. It's it's like the it's like the it's like the it's like the early 2020s filtered through uh the 1960s. And so it's just a little bit odd with that. Arguably, it is kind of salient to our times because I think if you were to retitle the movie, you would just title it Antifa the movie. Like it's like it's like a fullthroated celebration of basically violent social change, violent social revolution. Like and it's it's completely unap like I'm going to spoil I'm going to spoil I'm going to spoil it. I'm just going to spoiler alert. Yeah. by the end.
>> Spoiler alerts for monitoring the situation. Everyone's already seen it here. So,
>> it's a so it's a 2hour and 45minute movie that I went by the way and I went to the theater and I paid full price and like I smuggled in my snacks and like the whole thing. Um I go through the whole thing and I'm like hoping he's such a brilliant filmmaker. I'm hoping it's a subversive movie, right? And so I'm kind of hoping that the whole thing he's like by the end he's like really like he's like okay like these weather underground people who like went on the run for 20 years and destroyed their lives and like you know we're were always you know basically just like you know crazed privileged children like raging out against their you know their basically their parents and blowing [ __ ] up and killing people and just the whole thing was a giant mistake and and I was kind of hoping that that would you know that would be kind of the way that you could tell the story. No no no he's just like oh no that was great like like that was fantastically good. These people are amazing like they're they're these are the myths and legends of our time. he clearly wants to make these people into mythical figures and then at the end and then if he it's just very clear at the end he's like yes and I completely endorse and support all of this um and this is exactly what ch you know this is these are the role models that children should have and it's fantastic right um and so you know in a this is one of those movies where in a perverse way maybe maybe it stands the test of time that way where it's just like wow these people had like these people are constructed a mythos you know by by by by by in which violent robbery and like violent robbery and murder basically is great right like is wonderful right and so you know may Maybe that's, you know, I don't know. Maybe it's like reading Emma Goldman Emma Goldman essays a century later or something. It's just like, wow, these people kind of really got carried away, but like, you know, it's it's not what it could have been. Anyway, this this is the Okay, so so one is it's it's out of time, although you know, hopefully won't become more relevant. Um, and then uh the other is again that the business aspect of it, which is, you know, being a great filmmaker. Um, you know, this is the one that he got like the real budget for. So this is like a much bigger budget than any of the other movies that he's made. Um, and with that he was, you know, the cast is like just incredible. like so it's you know Leo DiCaprio and Sean Pen and Benito Del Toro and like all these amazing you know actors and actresses um but as a consequence I don't have the numbers in the top of my head but you know it it was estimated it cost something on the order of $200 million to make um and then it's it's more money on top of that um for um uh you know for for advertising um the the challenge and and then you know it's got Leo and you know he's by the way he's fantastic in it very entertaining but um by the way what yeah spoiler alert one one of the things about the message. Um, it's got the message. So, the Leo character, I don't know, plays one of these basically. He's a bomber basically in hiding for like 18 years or whatever, and he's got this daughter, the daughter of his his his lover who's this uh was this uh, you know, great like basically uh, you know, violent revolutionary in the era. Um, and uh, they've been in hiding for 18 years and he's like completely fried his brain on like, you know, drugs and alcohol. It's just like, you know, he's completely blown out as a person. He spends the entire movie running around like in his bathrobe like, you know, basically, you know, basically high. Um, and and if you actually watch the movie carefully all the way through, it actually turns out nothing he actually does at any point in the plot ever actually matters. Like like he he plays no actual role in the plot. Um, and so it's this like incredible performance and it's incredibly it's incredibly um, you know, dynamic and entertaining performance and the movie the movie is going to sell do well overseas as a result of that because people love Leo. Um, but like again it's consistent with the message of of course the white male lead can have no actual role to play in the plot. Like it it is you know that's definitely not allowed like in the climax, he literally shows up at the end of the climax and just like I'm here and like it's it's like all over, right? Like everybody's dead. Like it's all it's just done. Um so so anyway, it it's going to do reasonably well because because you know because it has Leo, but it's still going to lose like $120 million are, you know, the estimates that I'm hearing, which is, you know, a pretty pretty big loss.
>> Um you know, for for for a movie like this. the the the fear in Hollywood always is when there's when there's a movie that loses that much money, you know, will the executive green green light new original movies? Um, and you know, so hope hopefully they drove hopefully the lesson is drawn from this is, you know, basically it's, you know, is is is the is the Brad Eastern Ellis point, which is the the the what is what do you say the fussiness or the um
>> musty he said it's a musty film like
>> mustustininess. Yeah. Hopefully the conclusion is don't make movies that are going to be musty when they're released, right? like you know you you didn't have you know you didn't have to green light the thousandth movie with the message in 2022 like that was a choice you know so maybe don't do that anymore um you know but but you know but but maybe it's time to move on let me highlight the movie on the other side that I think is very underappreciated and I think has you know I you could say maybe at best right now it's becoming a cult classic it's just not that big of a hit but like I I have hopes for it and I hope it becomes one of these mythic movies which is Edington and uh let me let me start by asking have you guys both at this point seen Edington
>> I haven't I haven't Okay. Well, you're you're in for a treat. So So my opinion, my opinion, personal opinion, Edington is the first capital A art art great art movie. I I I've I feel like I've seen since once once upon a time in Hollywood, and I I think it clears the bar. And and I start by saying it's not a perfect movie. Like, you know, there, you know, there there are things about it that, you know, I'm sure five years from now or whatever, the even the maker of the movie might look back and say, you know, could have done things differently. So but but it's like it's it's like it has the opposite of the musty feeling. It has the feeling of, oh, I'm actually finally seeing on screen real people again. Like, finally, um, uh, like real people set in the real world doing real things where you're just like, wow, like that that I I'm actually seeing the world that we've actually spent the last 5 years living in. And it's the first movie, uh, like that that that I've seen in a long time. And specifically, it's the first movie, and it's amazing that this is the case, even with the time scales that we're talking about. It's the first movie in which like the George Floyd riots actually happened. Um, it's it's the first movie in which CO actually happened.
>> Um, it's the first movie in which social media actually happened. Um, it's the first movie in which wokeness actually happened. It's the first movie in which Trump actually happened. like and and it's actually and this is why I'm sort of having the reaction to the movie that I'm having which is just like it's the only movie in which any of those things actually happened in the universe of the movie cuz like I I don't know you tell unless I miss something like every other movie that's come out that's been significant over the last 5 years like it's as if none of that ever happened and and and and my explanation for that is these are all the hot button issues that if you screwed them up you in Hollywood you got your career destroyed right so if if you if you said the wrong thing about co lockdowns or vaccines. If you said the wrong thing about Trump, if you said the wrong thing about the Floyd riots, if you said the wrong thing about wokeness, like your career get obliterated. So, we have like a generation of creatives who basically just like got taught do not touch the stove. And and the aur who made Edington, it's an art tour movie, this guy Eric Aster, who's this young aur, very talented guy, he basically was like, I'm just going to grab the stove with both hands
>> and I'm just going to like hold it up for dear life. And it's like a roller coaster ride through every crazy [ __ ] thing that happened in the last five years. And I was just like howling with laughter. Put it this way. Me and the other four people in the theater who are watching it were just like, "Wow, it was amazing. It's finally happening."
>> Other bright side of this too is that it's not unknown actors, right? It's uh it's walking Phoenix, Emma Stone. Um and and what's what's really interesting about, as you said, like there's most media or you know, most most movies try to kind of gloss over social media or things where it's like actually hard to depict it on a screen. Like there's nothing really interesting about looking at your phone, but like getting a COVID nostril test is actually like very funny. And I know like the trailer begins with like pulling up in this like old car and getting the nostril test. It's just like it's just like a funny thing. And so it's like it's good that some of these more like absurd things that have happened in the last couple years. Like they're actually very cinematic and they should be put on C like they should be put like great filmmakers should be should showing them because they're so funny.
>> Yeah. So I'll do a couple again. I'm going to blow through the spoilers. Yeah. So the opening scene is Waen Phoenix. Wa Keane Phoenix plays this basically this crusty sheriff of this small town in New Mexico called Edington which actually kind of reminds me of the town I grew up in. And the key thing for the thing is Edington like there's just nothing in the town. Like it's like 600 people. It's just like the streets are empty, the stores are empty. I mean it's like a town that was empty before CO, right? Um and then and then the lockdowns hit and then it be and it became even more desolate. But like there's nothing happening and you could just walk around and there's nobody there. And so, uh, W Phoenix plays the sheriff who's like this crusty, unreonstructed, and he's not really a Trump supporter, per se, but he's like this sort of crusty, you know, kind of traditionalist, you know, kind of kind of guy. He's the kind of guy who just really does not want things to change that much. Um, and like everything is changing around him. And it it starts it starts in it starts when CO it starts in like April of 2020. Um, and he's sitting in this pickup truck in the middle of nowhere and he's like eating a sandwich or whatever. And the this other truck pulls up next to him and it's these u you know, it's it's a set in New Mexico. So there's these those the town that he's in are adjacent to these tribal lands. And so these two tri young tribal cops, you know, Native American cops pull up in in a in a pickup truck next to him and they're like, you know, they're like young and, you know, let's say cooler than he is. Um and and they're they like they and they're both wearing their masks, right? U and and and literally they're like, "Roll down your window." And he rolls the window and and literally from their pickup truck into his they're like, "You have to put your mask on, right?" And you know this like literally it was like for me it was like you know it was like the you know the heaven has opened the angels are singing I'm finally seeing a capital M movie like this and you know like he's a brilliant and so like he he gets across like in one look the feeling that I think we've all had for the last 5 years which is like like what the [ __ ] it's a and that's just the opening scene and then it cascades through all the co and then it cascades through and then you know spoiler alert again or spoiler it cascades through Floyd, so the Floyd riots hit midway through the movie and then all the and then you know the the the um the of course you know the local high school it's like you know the local high school is like 100% white um you know New Mexico and and you know and then the white kids basically become like obsessed with racial justice even though they literally don't know any black white people and they start like basically having like full-blown riots like you know in in the main street and like breaking store windows and like crashing everything and there's one there's one black there's one black person in town who's a sheriff's deputy who's keen deputy who's military vet and he's just like what the hell like he's like like why why do I have to defend the grocery store from the white kids like trying to burn it down on my behalf like what the [ __ ] Anyway, so so so the whole movie is like that and then maybe maybe just one more thing about it that's just hysterical. Eric, this is a good time for you to take a drink of water because you're going to love this part. Um this is good for the spit take out what um Pedro Pascal is in it. Um, and at first you would think Pedro Pastel plays the mayor and at first you're like, "Oh, this is going to be a clear setup uh where you know we finished is like the retrograde rightwinger and you know Pascal is like the voice of reason." It's like no no he's Gavin Newsome. Like I swear to God he's Gavin Newsome. Like 100% Pedro Pascal is playing.
>> What What does he do?
>> I I don't even want to like it's it's it's it's I don't even want to like I I don't I'm not even intending to bad. I'm just saying like or or just every other politician. whatever is your idea of a politician who's like Gavin Newsome like Peter Pascal Peter Pascal plays him and just like could not be looking down on the the the the sheriff character with more contempt. Um like just absolutely just like you know and and vice versa and then and then basically what happens is that you know they they effectively so the so the the uh the sheriff gets frustrated by the whole thing the lockdowns and everything and so he he decides to run for mayor and so then it becomes a fight you know between the two of them. Um which by the way is just the beginning of the movie like it it then gets actually quite a bit more elaborate after that. Um, but the big thing about it is it just it's like a full it's just like an absolute full frontal examination from top to bottom and and like it pulls in it like Katherine it doesn't have it's interesting it doesn't have a lot of like it doesn't have like a lot of on-creen graphics of like people on social media but it does have this recurring thing which again is just it's incredible how rare this is in movies or maybe other filmmakers haven't figured out how to do it which is these characters live in a world of social media. Um and so he he does this great like when a character in this movie wakes up he rolls over and he checks his phone right? Like it's it's it's our it's our world and and he does I think a very good job of showing the interle back and forth of how people are and again this is like a you know rural town in the middle of nowhere. People are living this you know this double life that that we all now live which is we've got our inerson life and then we've got our online life and there's this you know question of which one is more real. Um, and and and this is the first movie I've seen that actually just and and it doesn't incorporate that. Like it's not social media the movie. Like that's not what the movie is about, but it's just kind of it just kind of shows naturally how the nature of reality has changed around that and then how it how it influences real world behavior. Um, and anyway, so I I can't recommend it highly enough.
>> Isn't Emma Stone's character like taken by conspiracy that she finds online or like like what what is her her role in the movie?
>> Yeah. Well, so this is part of the uh so and and at this point I'm like grabbing the stove with with both hands also like she she plays like she plays like the upper middle class white woman um uh who's just like wrecked with anxiety and and this is like this is the plot arc like she's just like she's like incredibly deeply unhappy. Um and so yeah, so she gets locked into like online conspiracies and then there's this whole thing. I don't even I don't even want to spoil the thing that happens with her because it's it's quite it's quite something and it's quite a plot arc of its own. that um you know she she has her own her own kind of parallel life that kind of unfolds through this. She's because she's watching Fenix's husband and like and he he loves her and has absolutely no idea what she he has absolutely no clue what's going on in her head. Like he like married to her. He loves her. She's clearly extremely depressed. She's clearly extremely anxious. He has no ability whatsoever to understand her communicate with her. And then her mother, you know, her mother, you know, her mother, she's, you know, very close with her mother. her mother keeps showing up, you know, lives in town just and just [ __ ] hates him and just is like scathing towards him and he's like, "What? You know what? [ __ ] I'm doing my best. I can't read her mind. Like, I don't know what's going on." And so, you know, it's got that, you know, it's it's got like a whole it's got like a whole it's got like a whole arc there. Um, and then and then it's got another one more. It's got the uh there's there's the uh in the little in the little high school. Um there's a uh there's a a very attractive you know blond blonde high school girl uh who basically like becomes like completely committed to social justice um and is going on and she's got like all the you know patriarchy. She's got all the talking points like she's you know she's ready for her you know sociology degree. Um, and and then all the all the like boys and men like orbiting around her basically like become obsessed with like there's a there's a there's a white uh uh male high school kid who just like is like just generally oblivious and he he like has a thing for her and so like he starts reading Angela Davis um like in in an attempt to basically become attractive for her. Um and uh and uh anyway so like and he starts spouting off about white privilege and the whole thing.
>> Does it work? Uh um
>> because that's always the question.
>> It doesn't work
>> asking for tips.
>> It doesn't it doesn't work. It doesn't work for the purposes that he it doesn't work for the purposes that he intends it for. But um he he let's say he he ultimately u yeah he has a very successful I would say plot arc of his own. Um yes he he actually plays plays a major role in the in the he goes in his own journey and plays a major role the end of the movie. Um anyway, so it's just like it's one of these movies and you know people there's like you know different critiques of it and it's a little bit of a you know I don't know what they call like a shaggy dog story where like as the movie goes like increasingly crazy things are happening and and um and and things get kind of you know they they get kind of deranged in in in sort of a way that you know is is uh you know you could argue is like truly reflective how deranged things got or you could say you know maybe he gets a little bit carried away but like it's just it it directly it's it's it's such it's such it's such direct engagement with our times that that that and to me it just like wow I'm actually seeing on screen our world as opposed to these this sort of man either this manufactured view of a world that doesn't exist or this sort of manicured view where these topics have just become untouchable and so anyway so my my hope is it's the beginning of a wave of like there's so much material you know this is the old Tom Wolf thing which is like what did he what was Tom Wolf's term um he said what was it the his term is it the eight was the eight bill was is the the beast with 8 billion feet or what was his term like the mass of humanity he had this term where he's like like Tom Wolf always had this point view, you know, the great novelist journalist, the most interesting topic in the world is like the human race, right? Like the the the collective behavior of 8 billion people on planet Earth is like the most interesting thing in the world. And like the 8 billion people on planet Earth are always getting up to like the craziest [ __ ] And like if you want to like write great fiction, he was always telling people who wanted to write fiction. He's like, "If you want to write great fiction, you want to go out and you want to be with the people and you want to actually observe what's happening." And it's so crazy that if you just like write it down, you know, that that's how you that's how you like write the great American novel. Like that's what you do. And so he he would famously do this. And so when he did Bonfire the Vanities, he immersed himself in Wall Street. And when he did a Man and Full, he immersed himself in, you know, Atlanta real estate. And when he when he, you know, he did all, you know, Back Back to Blood, he immersed himself in the in the Miami, you know, Miami culture. And, you know, he he would go do this. And of course, you know, his critique was, you know, the new generation novelist, they sit in their apartment in Brooklyn, you know, you know, you know, with their typewriter, you know, and and and they they introspect, right? And and and that's why there there's no more great American novels. And so like Ari is like the fil he's like the filmmaker who got that. I don't know if he ever got, you know, red wolf or not, but like where he he he he understands that. He's like, "Oh, go immerse yourself in in in in what's actually happening um in real life and translate that." And he's he's he he was, I don't know, uniquely able to do it. Uniquely able to get away with it. Um I'm hoping he's the beginning of a wave of these. And you know, they don't it doesn't all have to be about CO or the Floyd rights or whatever. There's many many other topics you could do, but like you know, there should be a great there should be a great movie for every basically significant social cultural thing that happens. Um and and and that and there's th those opportunities are just laying all there's like hundreds or thousands of those opportunities just laying on the ground right now, you know, for for for the creatives who can go pick them up. And again, if and by the way, every creative writing this or hearing this is going to say, "Yeah, no [ __ ] but this, you know, will the studios green light it and pay for it?" Um, and that's that would be my other hope, which is, you know, some combination of of the Boulder executives at the streamers and at the at the at the studios, you know, example, you know, David David Olson, you know, who's clearly very very, you know, brilliant guy, you know, taking over Paramount and maybe maybe buying more studios, like, you know, guys like him are in a position to greenlight an entirely new generation of of of movie that could be both commercially successful and could be true art.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. I know. So, I guess is it your view that like we'll have this like 5 to sevenyear window of musty films that people like kind of pretend are decent, but then like we we kind of get the Edingtons as well where you're where you're going to see things open up again. So, we'll have this sort of like nice period of weirdness. Like I actually think looking back 50 years from, you know, 50 years from today, it'll be fun to look back at these films and be like that was wild that that was what we were time. So I but your your view is that that it is going to open up that there will be more Edingtons, there'll be more extremes and it's not just going to be um one battle after another um kind of the message.
>> Yeah. So um just quickly one more thing on one battle after another. So um the the critics are rapturous about this movie, right? And so if you read Rotten Tomatoes, the critics are, you know, it's like 98% or whatever. And the critics are just like this is like the most brilliant movie of all time. This completely captures you know yes this is like this is like the ultimate chronicling of like America's you know descent and it being you know the fourth Reich like you know this is yes this is like absolutely glory yes absolutely revol revolutionary violence should be glorified like the critics are like all in right and and and you know the movie critic community has like gone hard in on this just like you know just like so many other critic communities and so they're all in by the way this movie I don't know if it's going to but like it wouldn't be surprising if it sweeps the Oscars right it's just like you know the best the best the best movie ever made um you know and I and and but but how it's just going to be like every everybody everybody everybody who has been been through this you know spin cycle for the last eight years is you know I think people are on to it you know including the audience and so I and I think even the people participating in kind of what is already kind of an orgy of kind of hyperexaggerated critical admiration are probably all realizing that they're you know fundamentally being dishonest but um you know like so so Katherine to your point like yeah that machine like the the the the sort of the message machine like that machine is continuing to spin for now it's just very clear that like there's just like smoke and parts flying off of it like it's just you know it is it is it is going to it is going to rattle to a stop and then if you if you talk to people in Hollywood basically what they'll tell you is by by the way independent of people's politics what the sort of I would say short people in Hollywood generally all say is yeah the the cultural fever has broken you can now make you can now get movies green lit today that you could not get green lit two years ago um specifically and this this is amazing then this is good but like you can have comedies again uh like they actually say by the way they say this like they're like we we can now make comedies Yeah. Um, you can have funny movies. Uh, right. Because to have funny movies, you need to poke a sacred cow, right? Like the thing that makes comedy funny is like when it's when it's like subversive, when it when it when it like, you know, when it touches a nerve, like that that's that's, you know, that's what great adult comedy is. Um, and and you know, you just could not make a funny movie for the last eight years. Like it was impossible. It was way too risky. And but what they're saying now is that you can. And then maybe the other signal indicator, Katherine, of what's happening, which is Mel Gibson finally got green lit to do his sequel to um Passion to the Christ, which is the resurrection movie, and which he's which he's making right now. Uh at least my friends in Hollywood are like, "Yeah, that never would have happened." Um like that never would have happened under a Kamla administration. That never would have happened without the election result. And again, it's these are not even people who are proTrump. It's just okay. Like the national mood is shifting. We're not Yes. Mel Gibson of all of all people being like one of the clearly great filmmakers of of of our of our time. Um and you know having all of the issues that Mel Gibson has like yes that guy should get to make a movie
>> and specifically that guy should get to make that movie.
>> Um and and I and that's an example of what I'm talking about um is that that's possible this year in a way that wasn't before. Well, and the and the other thing that I think yesterday Young Washington came out the the trailer which Joel Studios which again is not Hollywood, it's based in Provo, but has proven that they can make very successful films for a different pocket of the actually likes patriotism. But I think in some ways like the the Top Gun success story. Yes, it's nostalgia, but like the fact that it did so well at the box office shows that there is an appetite for totally different content. like 50% of the would love to see movies that are patriotic or about something you know a biopic in history that's really interesting about George Washington. So I think in some ways it's like there's there is sort of this business case too of wow likeif you know the 50% of the country that's been starved for the content they want will actually pay to go to the theater and maybe we should support them.
>> Yeah. To that end Mark do do the do the executives under appreciate the Rotten Tomatoes phenomenon or just how distinct sort of the Yeah. with the critics or even their own staff are from the actual audience.
>> Yeah. So they they live it. They they live it. And so like I said, like for the last eight years, it's basically been a reign of terror. Yeah.
>> Um because the these critics and and like who the people these critics represent like had had the power of life and death over people's careers. Um and then they know the critics kind of went nuts, but you know, this is the problem with, you know, there's not that much they can do about it, right? The the critics the critics were able to succeed in their own field. Um you know, it's just like everything else that happened in media. The critics were able to succeed in their own field by kind of going arbitrarily wild. Um, and then you know there was basically there's basically nothing that if you're a movie street executive there's really nothing you could do about it because you know what do you do about it? If you if you ignore them they you know they attack you. If you engage with them they attack you. If you attack them they attack you back. Um and so you know there's been very little to do and then you know the critics are not well oh okay so so that's been happening and you know with and Hollywood like Silicon Valley and like every other industry like there is insolarity to it. Um, and so, you know, there's this self-re self-reerential thing. And so, when, you know, when the mood when when sort of opinion shapers, you know, move against you, you know, it it becomes a it becomes a real problem. And in Hollywood, you know, people get fired, right? Like, you know, every studio executive kind of knows that at some point they're going to get fired. People get fired off of projects all the time. Um, when people get fired, by the way, off of projects in Hollywood, like they may not, you know, they may not eat, they may not get another job for f, you know, for two years or five years or ever. Um, and so, you know, it's it's it's a high tension environment. Um, and so, yeah, I think I think they don't understand that. By the way, I also think that, you know, especially the sort of, you know, the Boomer executives, the Gen X executives, you know, they'll also tell you the same thing you'll hear, you know, that you heard in the valley and in Washington and elsewhere, which is, "Wow, the young staff is really radicalized, right?" And so, you know, so they're also afraid of their young staff. Um, and then by the way, you know, they're, you know, the these are mostly public companies. They're also afraid of their boards. The boards are afraid of the public shareholders. You know, the public shareholders radicalized. And so, it's a it was a very similar phenomenon to what happened in tech. um which is kind of this this sort of collective I I don't I don't like wildness or you know kind of kind of um you know kind of this this this intensity thing you know kind of happened and and and then it really couldn't be openly discussed for a long time and probably still can't like they probably still really can't talk about it in the public. A few of them are starting to but like not really. So for the most part the conversations are kind of in the background but again but against that it's just like okay that that's that's broken a bit and and part of it also is just the business the business um you know the kind of business aspect of it um which is I mean the the the classic is you know the big money maker in Hollywood for the last 20 years has been superhero movies um and and let's just say coincident with the beginning of the message is the you know the results in those movies collapsed right and so and and like at some point you know they need to go sell some movie tickets like it you know at some point they need to deliver revenue Um and I and I and I think they've gotten I don't know the message of the message which is you know if if if all you are is on board with the social trend right especially Katherine to your point especially when that social trend gets old and is no longer you know aarant like you can't run a public company based on on on on reviews right it it like at some point butts do have to show up in seats um and so I I think that that's also kicked in and so the the financial pressures are very painful right now they're probably not helpful I don't know the financial pressures in Hollywood are are it's hard to say because on the one hand when there's financial pressures in Hollywood. Of course, the argument is fewer movies get get green lit and then and then the executives become more risk averse than the kinds of movies they're willing to greenlight. Uh but I think it also means that they are also less willing to greenlight projects that are being green lit only for political reasons um or only for social cultural reasons or only out of a sense of fear. Um and so I don't know exactly how that balances but hopefully um hopefully things get u more exciting. By the way, of course the other big topic in Hollywood is AI. Um, and yeah, so that's the, you know, that's the 800 lb thing. And, you know, and and you know, to their credit, they're, you know, say they're highly aware of it. They're highly alert alert to it. Um, and then by the way, there are a bunch of filmmakers, including some folks that I know that are like super excited. Um, and so there there are including some like I know of like two like a triple A list like director, filmmakers, you know, top end people who are like very excited about what's possible. Um, and are are going to fully embrace it. Um, and there's there's a bunch of other people who are, you know, very excited. Um, and so, um, so there there's going to be an embrace by at least part, but there's also there's also, you know, there there's a lot of, you know, Hollywood has always had kind of a fear-driven reaction to new technologies. Um, and there's some of that. Um, and then, um, and then and then there is this attachment, and Hollywood is is actually very acute. There's this attachment of like AI politics to like woke politics. And so if if you're if you're still super woke, you're also like super anti-AI. Um, and there are these like basically it's basically like the woke activists have picked up AI as the new thing that they're going to agitate about. Um, and so and they're mounting basically already like pressure campaigns on the studios to like basically vow to never use AI. And at least so far the studios to their credit are like no, we're not going to do that. Um, like we're we we you know the studio so far I think the studio executives have all been consistent which is like look we've always used technology. Um, you know the the movie camera itself is technology. special effects like we've we've always used technology. You know, video tapes, DVD, streaming, these are all technologies. Um, you know, every movie has CGI, you know, like that's, you know, one of my little fun facts about history of movies is Tron. Tron was the first there's a big sequel for Tron that's out this week. The original Tron was 1988 um from from Disney and it was the first movie that had integrated use of computer graphics, which was the the big thing at the time. Um and um and as a consequence of that, Tron was disqualified from the Oscars um because they cheated uh by using computer graphics, right? Um right. And so and so, you know, to go from the that world to the world in which every movie has CGI and and for the most part, you don't even know that there's CGI in it. You just see a romantic comedy and they're using CGI to do all kinds of things in it and you don't even notice and it's just taken completely for granted. And so like I I I I think the studios the studios I think understand that. I think they're going to they're going to actually embrace it enthusiastically. there's going to be this there's going to be this like at least there's an attempt to like jin up a moral panic around it um and try to you know basically keep it out and I I don't think it's going to work because I think the economics are too compelling but but anyway but then the other thing with AI is of course AI is going to be super helpful to existing filmmakers but the other thing is AI for sure and we you know we see this especially in this last last in this last couple weeks with the new version of Sora um and a lot of these other new things that are coming out AI is going to make a whole new kind of filmmaker possible to exist for the first time which is the filmmaker with no visual skill, right? Or access to a set or to a camera or to actors, but with an idea. Um, like you like people are going to be able to make, you know, it's going to start with shorts and animated things and so forth, but it's going to it's going to work its way up to full movies. Um, and so, you know, people with a people people who otherwise would be limited to only being novelists or being maybe people who do graphic novels, um, but are creative geniuses, um, are going to be able to actually make full movies with AI. And I and again I think I think that's a reason for like profound optimism. I think we're going to get like completely new kinds of you know basically film and entertainment from people who otherwise never would would have been able to to access the medium and and I think that also is I'm very positive on that.
>> Can we end because you you brought it up um on comedy. I I know you saw gun or the the new naked gun film. What what was your thoughts on is comedy working? Is it is it does it have to be nostalgic for it to work? But may maybe tell us a little bit about that film and and whether it's a a reason to be positive on comedies in the future. Yeah. So, I thought Naked Naked Gun I thought was actually a little bit of a minor miracle. Um, so, uh, for a couple a couple reasons. So, one is look, it's it's it's a sequel to movies from like 40 years ago. Um, and so, you know, how many people even remember the original Naked Gun movies? It actually turns out a lot of people do. They're beloved movies, but also it turns out like you can you can make an like it's it's great. It's it's a great comedy. It's like a fantastic comedy. It's very funny. Um, uh, it wor it worked. It worked commercially. It worked it worked artistically. It it it it it honored the original material, but it was also like it was it was deliriously loopy in its own way. I highly recommend it. It's it's it's very funny. Um but actually, striking to that point, um it it it also like like Edington, it's also a post message movie. Um and and and this is actually and maybe this is a reason for optimism, which is again if you go back through the time scale, like that thing was green lit no later than 22, probably in 21. So, at the height of every movie has to have the message um that that movie was still green lit and it got all the way through and out the other side and there's not a trace of it in it. Um and so like it's it's a pure it's a pure comedy. It's a pure it's it's like the original movies. It's a pure comedy. It's a pure absurdist uh uh you know kind of modern three studio just you know style comedy. Liam Niss of course plays against plays against type uh and is of course a brilliant comedian and just kills it. And then Pam Anderson um you know the the great icon of you know 1980s you know femininity um you know it's her big it's her big you know starring role and she just like absolutely is just fantastic like she's just like absolutely kills it. She's hysterical. Um and she's just like and she's just like there as a person and like she's not you know she's not wearing you know she's just like you know she's she's like you know she's just like full woman um in natural form. Um and it's is it's it's great. Um, and you know, and it's, you know, it's a like there's and there's there there's no there's no, you know, there's none of the casting, let's say, you know, aspects that that kind of cause problems. Um, you know, there's none of the there's no script. It's just it's just like an extremely well executed, like it very easily could have been made in 2012 or in 2008 or in 2002. Um, no, look, it doesn't, you know, it doesn't move the artistic ball forward, right? It's a very well executed example of a genre. Um, but it but it is a movie that it was it was somehow able to escape all of the traps that all of these other movies have gotten into. Um, uh, and and was able to make it out and to be a big commercial hit and and again, I think I think the I think the executives are are are very encouraged by that. Um, the audience is still there for that. I'll just give you the it does it doesn't really have any like racial politics or whatever, but it does have it it did have one thing which is for people who haven't seen it. It was famously a movie originally that uh one of the co one of the major stars of it was OJ Simpson um playing a character named Nordberg um who got into all kinds of unlikely trouble. Um and um uh so they do this scene where I'll just spoil one one thing because it was it was extremely funny. Um Liam Niss so Liam Niss plays the son of the original you know main main guy Leslie Nielsen in the movie. So Frank Frank Frank Grebin and then and then Leslie uh Liam Niss plays Frank Grebin Jr. And then uh and then Liam's sidekick plays the son of of of of uh of Leslie Neil, the sidekick in the original movie. And then and then and then there's a young black guy on the team. Um and and you know, normally in a movie it's like, okay, of course there's like young black guy on the team, but they do they do it really well, which is that they've got the out in the out in the hallway of the police station, the movie, they've got Leslie Nielson's photo up on the you know, he passed away, so they they got his photo up and and Les and Liam Niss does this thing where he like kneels down and he's like, "Oh, you know, father, I'm trying to live up to your, you know, expectations and trying to be a great police officer." and he's like sobbing and there's tears and you know next to it is like his sidekick with the sidekick's photo and he's like oh father I miss you so much and I I want to be a great cop and then there's you know the the black kid and he's looking up at a at a photo of OJ and he just and he just look at the camera and he just goes
>> perfect perfection
>> absolutely perfect yes so yeah comedies are good by the way let me put in a plug for one more movie um uh if either You guys seen uh Fantastic 4?
>> No,
>> probably not. Um uh Fantastic 4 is the most pro- family movie uh in Hollywood since I can't even remember.
>> Um uh Katherine in particular, I think you'll be astonished.
>> It's incredible.
>> Come out.
>> What's that?
>> Did it come out?
>> It came out this summer. It came out this summer. It came out this summer. And Marvel, just for context, it's it's one of the big It's one of the new Marvel one of the new Marvel tentpole properties. Um, and and the Marvel the Marvel machine, you know, did incredibly well from like Iron Man in 2008 through Avengers Endgame and like whatever 2020, but for the last five years, many of the big Marvel projects have have have not done well, both the TV shows and the movies. And and you know, you could again, you could argue different reasons why, but like Critical Drinker would tell you it's because they became consumed by the message. Um, Fantastic 4 is it's it's it's and look, it's like a you know, it's like a diverse cast. It's got it's got like a lot of the lot of the modern stuff in it, but however, and um it's like it's just like 100% prof family um in like a very actually quite deep and moving way. Um and so again, it's just it's a little bit like wow, they greenlisted this thing in 20 and you know, maybe again maybe this reason may maybe I'm actually too too cynical. Maybe in 2022 they already real the filmmakers already realized what was happening and so maybe they actually had like their own version of the underground movement where they're like all right it's time to start planting the seeds for what is going to come out of this whole thing when when sort of the panic subsides. Um and and and you could say like Fantastic 4 is like it's like a true audience pleasing blockbuster from a studio that has been obsessed with the message um that comes out and doesn't have a trace of it in it at all. Um, and um, and and furthermore, it's like a it's like 100% above. Like it it like I wouldn't say it's like it's not I mean it's a it's a superhero movie, so it's not like a political I wouldn't say it has like political content, per se, but um, it's like it's like 100% pro family in a way that's very touching.
>> We'll put on the list.
>> Um, do you think your kids will love it? Your kids love it. I took my 10-year-old and like he was like, yeah, he he doesn't he doesn't react emotionally to things, but he was like as close to crying in a movie as I've ever seen him. So
>> Wow. Do do you think Atlas Shrugged or the Fountain Head could could get made today? And do you think there'd be an audience for it?
>> You know, it's funny. Yeah, it's funny. It's so funny. Especially Atlas like Alice Rugr has become Al is Alice Shrug, you know, people who don't know, it's the sort of famous ran novel. It's kind of her most successful novel. Um, it it's the novel that basically it it it clearly is like a great mythic American novel. Like it clearly it clearly clears that bar that we were talking about earlier. You know, it's it's it is one of the great American novels. Um, you know, it's it's of a time and place, which is sort of the, you know, the sort of 1950s, but it it it's written in a way that can be kind of deliberately timeless. It's it's it's actually kind of it's actually interesting how it's written because it kind of it it's like obsessed with railroads on the one hand, which makes it kind of look back to the 1800s. Um, but it also it's also has like science fiction elements. And she kind of did that, I think, deliberately so that it would kind of have this timeless kind of she's really talking about, you know, it's a movie. It's a novel as the great novels. It's a novel about people and the behavior of people. Um uh and so um but she does this thing where she kind of abstracts the specific content of it in order to kind of try to make it timeless. And I think I think it works quite well. Um and the fountain head is is another version of that. The the Atlas shrug basically is about is about is about broadly is about it's about it's about American dynamism. It's it's American dynamism the movie. It's about industrialization and progress and science and going to the stars and like you know achieving great things. Um and um you know and and and the shapest societies that do that. Um, The Fountain Head is is is more about, I would say, artistic achievement um and and artistic purity. Um, uh, and is sort of similarly evocative. And so, both those novels are, you know, high up on the list of novels that will be very influential, you know, in a 100 years. Both of those novels have been absolutely scathingly hated by every, you know, good cultural commentator and critic for the last, you know, basically since they came out. Like just and and those novels are just attacked in like the most vicious possible terms. Um, like absolutely um, absolutely. In fact, famously, famously, Whitaker Chambers, the reformed communist, reviewed uh Atlas Shrugged for National Review when it came out in the 1950s and he, you know, he basically called her a Nazi. Uh in National Review, Whitaker Chambers, who became this famous right-winger, basically calls and ran a NI. And Ran, of course, being a Jewish refugee from Russia. Um he he said he said the novel quote has the whiff of the gas chamber about it, right? And so like which by the way, it doesn't, but but anyway, very unfair unfair. Um, but um, but anyway, it's like it's like your diversion to the Rotten Tomato scores of the of the critics versus the versus the audience. Like basically everybody who's read Atlas Shrugged like loves it. Um, and everybody who's like criticized it for a living just [ __ ] despises it, right? Just like completely despises it. Um, and so and and what's what's interesting about it and maybe this is the importance of the novel is to your question like that that that aspect of it has lives today. So like anybody today who anybody today who every time I've ever talked to anybody who's read Atlas Shrugged in the last five years and they're like wow it's like the novel about the world we live in like it's it's it's like oh I know that guy and I know that guy and I know that guy and Eric knows what I'm talking about right like these are all people right like these are all people these are all archetypes of people we know who these people are we know what they're doing like it's just it's amazing how perceptive it is you know 60 or 80 years later like how how how primal she made it that it has that relevance um it and by the is tremendously entertaining and it's like this sprawling narrative and it's these incredible characters and so yeah it like it very clearly ought to be a three-part movie or you know at a at a huge budget or it ought to be like an an eight season you know 10 episode 80 episode total you know lavish HBO show or something but like the cultural like the cultural overlay of that like what it would take in Hollywood to do that and the the level of attack that you would come under uh the level of savagery that you would encounter if you're the executive or the actor or whatever I mean it would it would be every bit as intense today as it was in the 1950s when the novel came out. And so like like that would be the great like that would be the indication that like we're in a like really different world. I'm I've talked to some folks in Hollywood about it. They they they all know it. They all understand this. They all know the novel. You know, they're all very familiar with it. They all, by the way, love the idea of of of doing things that have pre-existing brands and audiences built in. Um you know, because that that really reduces the risk. But like they if you really talk about it, they it's a little bit like a hot stove, you know, step away. And by the way, and again, it's very striking that a novel from like whatever 1953
>> can still be generating the hot stove reaction in 2025. Uh, you know, is pretty amazing.
>> And and the flip side of that is because it's such a cult classic that people would come out and drove. Like it would, you know, it would uh it would make a lot of noise in a good way.
>> It would be, you know, it would be the Silicon Valley version of the Minecraft movie, right? Like it would just be like, "Yep, we're all going."
>> Yeah.
>> Um but uh you know, I don't know. Maybe maybe that maybe it's not a big enough audience or whatever to to to you know big maybe that's not a big enough cult classic thing but like it but by the way it sells like the you know it's one of the bestselling novels of all time. It sells you know enormously well today. It sold well basically since it came out. Um you know it's it's it sells it sells far better you know. I mean it's one of these things it sells it'll sell far more copies this year than any well-reviewed novel you know that the New York Times Book Review talks about. Right. And so and and yet it is just like it is so completely politically unacceptable that it's like off the map. Um yeah. So that that would be the ultimate test. I I would love to see it happen. I I yeah I I don't know. And by the way, this may maybe maybe the answer here maybe this is the AI, right? Maybe the answer here is AI. Uh maybe what we need is AI system where you feed the novel in and it makes the movie. Um you know which by the way for you know now now that I say that like for sure that's going to happen. Um and so you know maybe that's actually the answer.
>> Yeah. Yeah. We were laughing uh offline about how someone uh was using Sora to make like a something that we thought was better than South Park and and so it'll be interesting to see if a whole new crop of filmmaker um sort of you know democratizes the industry a little bit that it's not just Hollywood but it's people you know from all over and studios don't have this sort of um you know monopoly over over creation of of high quality stuff. So yeah we'll see.
>> Yeah. So South Park actually let's close closing this but just briefly on South Park. South Park was very much like what you're seeing with AI film making right now but in 199 19 1993 so I remember when South Park the original South Park came out the original South Park came out 1993 and it was significant it was the first internet viral video ever um it was the first video and this was like pre-streaming preyoutube pre you know years before all of that and so it literally um distributed at the time as a literally it was a quick time movie um uh it was Apple's quicktime video format um and it was a downloadable thing and like if you wanted to download it on a modem you had to like leave the modem on for like an hour or something to like download this thing and And what it was was it was a it was a digital scan of a um of a video Christmas card. So there was a an executive in Hollywood at the time that wanted to make his friends a special kind of Christmas card. And so he hired these two basically scrappy young you know basically film students Matt Maststone and Trey Parker who had no credits and you know they were just you know kids and hadn't done anything yet. And he hired them to and he basically said make the most offensive basically like three minute video Christmas card you could possibly imagine. And so and and with these with these kids it was it was a technology at the time. What they did was they camcorders digital cam digital camcorders are brand new. So they used digital camcorder and then but then then they did stop they did stopotion. They had no money so they did stopotion animation using little cardboard using literally construction paper uh characters. And so the reason the characters look like they do is because literally in the original thing they were cut out of construction paper and they were literally moved by hand frame to frame and then and then and then the two kids did did the voiceovers. But it was from the very beginning it was the same characters Cartman and Kyle and Stan and Kenny, right? And and and and and in South Park, which is the town that these kids grew up in. Um and then it was a threeminute Christmas card and it was it was uh Santa Claus versus Jesus. Um and and and and Santa Claus versus Jesus and ended up in a in a full kung fu fight, you know, complete with like blood and like body parts, right? And so it was like this it was like, you know, max it was intended to be like m maxually offensive, but it was like it was like really it was it was really funny. And so somebody got and literally it was sent out on videotape, right? B DVD, right? So sent on videape and somebody actually scanned the videotape, which is actually hard to do and then it it went super viral on the internet uh and became big. And so it's an example of, you know, that that everything I just described, the camcorder, like that that was the the AI of its time. It let these kids who had no access or no knowledge even necessarily of like traditional animation production methods to do this. Um, by the way, when those kids actually then got their their they actually, you know, is like a full studio now. You know, it's been tremendously financially successful. They they now have a complete state-of-the-art studio production facility. And what they've used it for is they've used it to hyper optimize computer models of the optimal recreation of the aesthetics of the construction paper. And so if you watch South Park episodes today, you see actually the characters have there's actually a depth to the animation that shows the layers of the construction paper. It's all produced digitally today, but like they've used state of air digital tools to re to to reconstruct the physics of construction paper. Um, you know, you know, 30 years later. Um, and so yeah, so so they were able to do that and then obviously, you know, they were maybe the maybe the most successful like animation duo uh of the last 30 years. And yeah, I think that the AI thing is we're we're right on the tipping point um of that and and to your point like maybe maybe we actually just saw the first one. It's it's it's so um let's say toxic that it's hard to recommend that people watch it.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Um uh but um it is it it is it is a it's for sure a South Park caliber level thing created in AI by somebody who didn't use any of the traditional you know they didn't use any they didn't use any traditional you know techniques you use for animating anything uh it was created entirely with Sorup uh scene by scene um and yeah it's it just as a as a as a as a demonstration of technology it's just it's obvious that that moment has now arrived and to your point Eric like I do think for example I think there's now actually a new form of political propaganda Yeah.
>> At Lucen the World, which is, you know, the basically the custom produced, you know, basically South Parkish, you know, kind of, you know, video series and and AI is going to make that so easy for people to do
>> that. You're going to be able to do, you know, anybody in any, you know, any electoral race is going to be able to hire some kid to, you know, to to do things like this. Um, and so it's going to be like this. It's like, I don't know, decentralized satire or something like that.
>> And so, yeah, the the the the moment has arrived, the the art form shifts again.
>> On on that note, we got to let you go. Um, but this has been a fantastic episode of modering the situation. Thanks so much for coming on, Mark.
>> All right. Fantastic. Situation monitored.
