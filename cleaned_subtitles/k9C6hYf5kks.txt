responsible investment work is all about creating long term value for Future Generations We are an investor in almost 9000 companies Across 70 markets and our Returns comes from the value responsible and Think and Act long Ter l many companies men one challenge to longis the pressure of qu reporting rep Frequency and long value creations and key points are simple qu reporting and the pressure on management to reach earnings guidance can lead to short term decisions it May hinder growth and innovation and it May also deter companies from accessing public markets This is not about frequent Disclosure and activ May lead behav that is not long value Creation companies incen to make long decision CE Simply longer term incentives in CE pay Remains a Priority to us We Believe the current system is not good enough at aligning the interest of ceos with us as shareholders and last year we were busy Gathering Invest views on copay in the US and weed much our Arum and on longer Ter stock lins isly prefer model board voting 426 PES Intel and Amazon one company we supported one we did not Intel we voted against because misalignment between pay and performance the structure of the to see that the CEO later in the year Ste down on the other hand we have Amazon in 2023 Amazon mov to a simple transparent CEO pay package the CEO is Paid in shares that pay out gradually over 10 years incentivizing him to think and Act long term and this is the kind of approach We want to see the long Perspective is also crucial in other areas not the least the climate transition and May can more that will you I can climate Risk is financial Risk extreme weather Flods fires Storms last year weather induc Price increases in things like olives Coco coffee oranges and we likely to record insurance payouts to so climate change affects the companies we invest in and World growth And That's why we are working for the transition of our investment portfolio That's in our economic interest and it's what our climate plan is all about and as we coming into the last year of the climate plan 2024 Was all about making sure we progress on the really ambitious targets we set back in 2022 Is it working Well data we Show to shows you real and increasing climate Risk We are seeing a need for a faster transition and more government action It's Complex It's challenging but we also seeing the transition happening we seeing record renewables investments we seeing more targets from companies and we seeing emissions falling and this Matters to us because our data also shows that if you have good climate targets you actually reduce your emissions those without targets reduce less than those with 74% of our emissions in the portfolio are now covered by scope one and scope 2 science Bas targets And that's up 6% from 2023 and Dialog becoming richer to climate related topics that me ched incre since 2019 and this nice slide shows sort of growth from over last years you know as you can see the numbers are coming up the topics are getting more Concrete And it really points to it now being a very central part of our company dialogue and we like to see this because they say that the proof of the Pudding is in the eating and we said in our climate plan that the largest emits should reduce emissions and Will support transition emissions Inter Dat look How often the Trans in ear and slightly picture Mass increase and May reduction some thats 2 ener cris comping How do How doon most efficiently Which Invest mak sense now and this focus on Concrete short Ter action is good but we would also like to remind companies that we need a longterm Focus to because this is not one the for long Val forer long AC long term thinking This is important for the fund climate Risk actually also important in itself Because we see that markets Rea negatively today When companies fail to deliver on their climate Commitments as you see here our analysis shows a clear drop in share prices when companies lose their climate Target approval Credible climate targets and execution matter for value Creation and if you like this type of analysis I suggest you go to our nature and climate
