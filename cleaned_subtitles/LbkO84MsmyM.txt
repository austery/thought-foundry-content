I need to start with a disclaimer, 
because I work for the US Government,  
and they require you to do a disclaimer. So: 
the ideas that you're about to hear are my  
ideas. They don't necessarily represent those 
of the US Government, the US Navy Department,  
the US Department of Defense, let alone the Naval 
War College where I work. Are we all good on this? 
All right, so today I'm going to tell you 
a story of three protagonists, Russia,  
the United States and China, that all wanted 
to work their magic on India and Pakistan,  
which didn't exactly appreciate it.
So two big topics. One is intervening in  
someone else's problems, a cottage industry for 
the United States. And also before you do that,  
you really ought to check out the alignments. 
Who's the primary adversary of whom? How long has  
it been that way? And also ask these questions 
about all the neighbors and anyone who might  
want to crash the party along with you.
It's also a story of a series of limited  
wars. What's a limited war? It means it's for 
something less than regime change. So however  
it turns out the governments that started that 
war are still in place. And two of them resulted  
in quick victories, the ideal in warfare. 
The first one was the Sino-Indian War of  
1962. And the other one was the Bangladesh War 
of Independence in 1971. And these wars change  
things in many short term expected ways and 
then in many long term, highly unexpected ways. 
So I'm going to go into all of this with you all. 
So here's my game plan, and it's literally a game  
plan. I'm going to start out with the pivotal 
decisions made by different players. Then,  
once they're made, certain things are foreclosed 
and certain things are possible. And this is the  
playing field delimited by these pivotal 
decisions. And then I'm going to look at  
the teams. Some allies were prime allies, others 
were subprime, and they mixed and matched over  
time. So I'll do teams, and then I'll do the 
game, the interaction, and then at the end,  
I'm going to do the plays, some of the techniques, 
things that you can do to play this game. 
Pivotal decision number one. When Mao 
won the Chinese Civil War in 1949,  
it didn't end. He also spent the next two years 
not only eliminating Nationalist remnants,  
but also conquering Xinjiang and Tibet. Tibet had 
been autonomous since 1911, when the last dynasty  
had collapsed. And Mao decides that he is going 
to reconquer Tibet. Tibet's an interesting place  
it contains, I think, about 40% of China's mineral 
resources. So there's a lot of money being made in  
Tibet for those with the capital to invest in big 
mines. If you look at this map, the Han Chinese,  
the preponderant group of China, they inhabit, 
they dominate as far west as the Chongqing Basin  
and Sichuan. And then you go further west, 
in-towards Tibet. China has put large armies  
into Tibet exactly twice. Once under the Qianlong 
emperor in the late 18th century, they didn't stay  
for very long. And then under Mao in 1950. And 
they have stayed forever and built roads so they  
could keep on sending more in. Between 1950 and 
1957, China built a series of road systems through  
Tibet. And the western route there is the only one 
that provides year round traffic. The problem with  
the other two is, well, check it out. They go 
through 14 or 15 mountain ranges. It means you  
go vertical up, vertical down – do that 14, 15 
times. And then between monsoon rains and snow  
and mudslides, they're very difficult to maintain. 
And then the eastern one crosses the major river  
systems of South Asia. So that's difficult. So 
only the western route is the really good one.  
And it's really important for the Chinese if you 
want to conquer Tibet, you truly want that one. 
All right, so if you look at this, that western 
route provides not only the ability to control  
Tibet, but it also provides a pincer onto 
Xinjiang. If China wants to come in one  
way and the other way, it's a good way to get 
in. If you look at those two circles there,  
those are the disputed areas between China and 
India. The northern one is the Aksai Chin Plateau,  
which China has taken from India and India still 
claims. And in the south is Arunachal Pradesh,  
which India still owns, but China claims. And 
so these are the areas that they're fighting  
over. But once China took Tibet…Before, there had 
been a big buffer zone between China and India,  
right? There's all this Tibet, and no one could 
really get in there. Now China's built roads so  
it can get into places where India cannot 
deploy troops until it gets into the road  
races with the Chinese. And so it reduces the 
buffer zone between China and India to these  
small Himalayan kingdoms of Nepal, Bhutan and 
Sikkim. So it changes things. So that's pivotal  
decision number one, deciding to conquer Tibet.
Pivotal decision number two is the United States,  
in order to deal with the Soviet Unions under 
Eisenhower, did what the wits back in the day  
called pactomania. What is that? It's forming all 
sorts of bilateral relations and also regional  
groupings in order to counter the Soviets 
institutionally and wall them in that way. And  
part of this was what was called the Northern 
tier strategy, as seen in the Baghdad Pact,  
where you get Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan 
to form this thing, and it's to wall off the  
Soviet Union from the oil fields of the Middle 
East. East. And the other thing, you should look  
at this map before it goes away. Look where 
Pakistan's located, where you think it is,  
and then go to the east, and that's East Pakistan. 
In the 1971 war, there's going to be a civil war,  
and Pakistan's going to lose East Pakistan, which 
is Bangladesh today. So just keep that in mind. 
So as part of the sweetener for Pakistan to join 
the Baghdad Pact, the United States allied with  
Pakistan and gave them a big military aid treaty. 
And here's Nehru, the Prime Minister of India,  
and he is horrified. A military pact between 
Pakistan and the United States changes the  
whole balance of power in this part of the world, 
affects us most especially. The United States must  
realize that the reaction of India is going 
to be, you're arming the Pakistanis. Whom do  
you think they're going to shoot? It'll be us. 
And the Indians were just appalled that we did  
this. And afterwards, Eisenhower admitted it was 
“perhaps the worst kind of plan and decision we  
could ever have made.” It was a terrible era, 
but now we're stuck with it. Because what the  
United States is slowly discovering is that if 
you arm either India or Pakistan in this period,  
it's going to aim it at the other one. And so 
that pact poisoned US Relations with India for the  
duration of the Cold War and set up things in ways 
the United States ultimately wasn't happy with. 
Okay, those are two pivotal decisions. Now for 
a pivotal situation, it's really the devolving  
situation between Russia and China. Until Mao got 
atomic weapons in 1964, he really had to shut up.  
And because he needed Russian technological aid, 
he's been totally cut off from the West. After  
the Korean War, he's being isolated. So he truly 
needs Soviet aid. And he also, if he wants nuclear  
weapons, he needs some of their aid to do that 
as well. So he has to keep his mouth shut. But  
once he detonates an atomic weapon, here's what he 
tells the Russians, and they just about lose it.  
There are too many places occupied by the Soviet 
Union. The Russians took everything they could.  
We have not yet presented an account of this 
list. Under the czars, the Russians took from the  
Chinese sphere of influence territory exceeding US 
east of the Mississippi. Think the Chinese didn't  
notice? Yes, they noticed. So Mao all of a sudden 
is calling that. And the Russians are appalled. 
But Mao has other gripes against the Russians. 
Stalin, in the lead up to World War II,  
had made sure to set up the Chinese to fight Japan 
so that he wouldn't have to. So that leaves him  
just fighting Nazis, not Nazis and Japanese. And 
then Stalin takes Mongolia, which had formerly  
been a part of the Chinese sphere of influence. 
And in the Korean War, he's more than happy to  
fight to the last Chinese. And then during the 
Chinese Civil War, the Russians tell Mao, oh,  
stop, Yangtze, you need to take a little breather 
here. Because he wants a divided China like the  
divided Germany he has, and then the divided Korea 
he's going to get. You want to be surrounded by  
these little broken states around you if you're a 
continental power. And then when Stalin dies and  
Mao wants to be senior statesman of communism, 
Khrushchev is appalled by that. Then Mao is  
appalled when Khrushchev does de-Stalinization, 
because Mao has his own cult of personality. And  
then Khrushchev wants to do peaceful coexistence 
with the west, while Mao is ramping it up in the  
Cultural Revolution, so there's no meeting 
of the minds. And then all this becomes very  
public when it hits the propaganda press of the 
Communists, of the Sino-Soviet split in 1960. 
All right, the Russians have their own gripes 
about the Chinese, and here's how they go. The  
Russians look around at the west and particularly 
the United States and go, wow, they got bases  
everywhere. The British have got bases everywhere. 
How come our allies won't give us bases? I mean,  
well, if you occupy Eastern Europe, the whole 
place is a base, but that's a different matter.  
So the Russians want the Chinese to let them 
keep a couple of remaining czarist treaty ports,  
essentially, and want to expand them. And 
the Chinese say, forget it. And in fact,  
after the Korean War, when the Chinese have 
troops all up in Manchuria, which is where these  
bases were located, and there's a succession 
struggle going on because Stalin's just died,  
the Russians have to return the bases because 
there's just too much bad stuff happening where  
they live, live. And then what Mao does in 
‘54 and ‘58, which just appalls the Russians,  
are these two Taiwanese Strait crises. What's 
going on? Mao is lobbing all kinds of ordnance  
on these islands that are owned by Taiwan, 
that are very close to the People's Republic's  
shores. And the Russians are appalled they are not 
consulted, and yet they have a friendship treaty  
that obligates them to provide to join a war under 
certain circumstances. And the Russians are going,  
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, there could be nuclear 
follow-on from this stuff. So the Russians then  
asked the Chinese if it's okay if they have a 
combined naval base on China's shores. And China  
says, forget it. The Russians are thinking, okay, 
well then we're not going to give you any of the  
plans for the atomic weapon. And it all devolves. 
So there's no love lost on either side. And then  
what exacerbates these tensions is the Vietnam 
War where China wants influence over neighbor  
Vietnam. That is pretty typical. But Russia wants 
influence over Vietnam to do a pincer on China,  
which China doesn't like at all. Meanwhile, 
both of them want to prove their revolutionary  
credentials by aiding the Vietnamese, North 
Vietnamese. So Russia's aid needs to come by train  
over China, lest the United States sink at the 
good stuff if it goes by sea. So the Chinese feel  
obliged to let it go through, but they're just 
hassling Russians the whole time through. They  
take it apart, tear it apart, say it was from 
China. And the Russians are just apoplectic.  
So their relations are getting worse and worse 
and worse and the squabbling is just incessant. 
So it's not surprising that the Sino-Soviet border 
conflict of 1969 breaks out - during the Vietnam  
War. And while all this is going on, this is one 
of the river islands, the Amur river forms much  
of their border, and this is one of the islands 
there. And there's much fighting over it. And the  
Russians come to us, the Americans, and say, “is 
it okay if we nuke these people?” And the United  
States says, “no, there's no way it's okay to 
nuke these people”. And Mao figures it out. The  
one that wants to nuke you, that's the primary 
adversary. So prior to that moment, the United  
States is the primary adversary of both Russia and 
China. Now with this, they're primary adversaries  
of each other. It causes a reshuffling of the 
allies, and I'll get to that later. So, okay,  
I've done the playing field of these decisions 
that delimited it. But now I'm going to get to the  
allies, and some allies are better than others. 
And here we got Mao and Khrushchev. Look at these  
lovebirds. Boy, when that divorce took place, boy 
did it mess up the extended family. Nevermind.
  
And the point, for my purposes tonight, I'm going 
to use the word "alliance" really loosely. If you  
sign a mutual defense pact - for my purposes 
tonight that makes you an alliance - allies.  
And if you're a political scientist, you've 
got something that's much more complicated,  
but forget it, I just can't handle it. So 
we're going to do it this way. All right? 
So Stalin didn't think much of Nehru at all. He 
thought he was a lackey of British colonialism.  
But Khrushchev thought India was really important 
to counterbalance China. And here's Nehru thinking  
about it. Well, look, we have to be on friendly 
terms with both Russia and America. But actually  
he felt much more in common with Russia. 
Why? Because he favored Fabian socialist  
economic policies that were much more akin 
to what's going on in Russia than it was in  
the United States. Moreover, the United States was 
segregated, which appalled Nehru. And in addition,  
the United States was cozying up to all the 
colonial powers. So Nehru thought the Russians  
were the better bet. While all this is going on, 
the Indians were non-aligned and they treated  
the Chinese really generously. And I've got a 
whole list of generosity. So India immediately  
recognizes China in 1950. Countries like the 
United States didn't, for forever. And when the  
San Francisco Treaty, I think, is signed in 1951 
in the United States, ending the war with Japan,  
India refuses to sign because China and Russia 
aren't there to sign as well. And then to help  
China break out of its diplomatic isolation 
at the end of the Korean War, India signs a  
friendship treaty with China. And as part of 
that friendship treaty, it recognizes Chinese  
sovereignty over Tibet. Under international law, 
contrary to what Vladimir Putin is doing lately,  
under international law, if you recognize 
someone's sovereignty over territory that is  
permanent, you cannot back out of it legally under 
international law. So the Chinese promise, I don't  
know, there's some like, peaceful coexistence 
or whatever they're promising the Indians, but  
that has no permanence under international law, 
whereas this thing does. And then from 1960 on,  
the Indians are voting to seat the People's 
Republic of China, not Taiwan, on the UN. 
Meanwhile, in the background, all this 
road-building is going on. Those roads  
are being built between 1950 and 1957. 
And the Indians aren't going to figure  
out until 1958 that the roads are 
there. Meanwhile, road's completed.  
The Chinese want to complete their control over 
Tibet, and so they're going to send big armies up  
there. And Tibetan culture is much more…It's of 
Indian origin, it's not Chinese origin. So this  
repression of Tibetan culture just appalls 
the Indians. And then two days before the  
People's Liberation of Army is going to make 
it into Lhasa, which is the capital of Tibet,  
the Dalai Lama flees-he's the spiritual leader 
of Tibet-he flees to India where he's remained  
ever since to the absolute horror and anger of 
China. So at about this time, the Chinese come  
to the Indians and say, “look, why don't we 
do a swap on sovereignty?” You recognize our  
sovereignty over that Aksai Chin Plateau where 
nobody lives, but it's really good for the roads,  
China's western route. And then we'll recognize 
your sovereignty over this much more densely  
populated Arunachal Pradesh. And Nehru 
doesn't want to hear anything about it. 
So during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when Russia 
is much too busy worrying about who's going to  
be lobbying nukes at home, this is when China 
launches in the 1960s Sino-Indian War and China  
just takes the Aksai Chin Plateau. The Indians are 
appalled because they don't have any roads to be  
able to deploy up there, whereas the Chinese do. 
Their defeat is just total. And they can't believe  
the Chinese did this to them. Here's Nehru 
afterwards. There are not many instances in  
history where one country, that is India, has gone 
out of her way to be friendly and cooperative with  
the Chinese government and people and plead their 
cause in the councils of the world. And then for  
the Chinese government to return evil for good and 
even to go to the extent of committing aggression  
and invade our sacred land. Who does this? So 
I get it. The Chinese get the territory they  
want. That was the goal of that war. But what they 
have done is taken a country, India, which had its  
leadership terribly idealistic, not interested in 
becoming militarized at all and making them angry  
forever. India immediately doubles the size of 
its army within the next 10 years to up to 750,000  
people. Creates 10 mountain divisions useful 
against China. And they've never ceased being  
so angry. And then if you think about this, what 
if instead of playing this game this way, China  
and India had teamed up? I would suspect we would 
be in a completely very different world order now,  
if that is what they'd done instead. But this is 
China's decision, not India's fault on this one. 
All right, so that wasn't great. So let's check 
out other possibilities once that happens to  
India. India is all of a sudden looking for 
Russia to counterbalance China. And you also  
have Pakistan wondering what to do and what 
the Pakistani notice after all this: well,  
the Chinese are not going to be teaming up with 
India, right? They've just invaded the place. And  
so this is when Pakistan sees that China might 
have real possibilities as an ally. And Bhutto  
is going to play the China card for the nuclear 
chip, trying to get Chinese help for all of that.  
And here's what happens. So you have the '62 war, 
and then in 1963, Pakistan really inexplicably is  
ceding territory to China. Who does that? And 
there are various possibilities down here, but  
I'm surmising it's because it's going to help on 
nuclear development. That would explain why you  
would give a lot of territory. But we don't know. 
There was supposed to be some mutual defense pact  
maybe, and there's some other things going on. 
Anyway, you can imagine what it may or may not  
have been. Okay, in the case of Pakistan and 
China and India and Russia, they had quite a  
good relationship because the Pakistanis and the 
Chinese shared India as their problem, and the  
Russians and the Indians shared China as their 
problem. And that worked pretty well. But the  
United States was just a disaster from both Indian 
and Pakistani point of view, and vice versa,  
because the United States wanted to befriend 
both of them. But if you befriend one, the other  
is appalled. And so the United States wound up 
appalling everybody. And so what the United States  
wanted to have happen is for India and Pakistan 
to put aside their differences and then combine  
against China and stop communism from spreading. 
India and Pakistan want to use the United States  
for maximum aid to use against the other, which 
is a non-starter for the United States. And then  
Pakistan really would like it if the United States 
would be nice with China as well, because Pakistan  
wants to have good relations with the United 
States and China. And that's a non-starter  
for the United States until 1971, when there are 
secret visits and things going on. It's later on.
  
Okay, so in 1962, India gets trounced in this 
war with China. They look like they're militarily  
feckless. And then in 1964, Nehru dies, right? 
He'd been the head of India since independence in  
1947. He'd been there a long time, so he's dead. 
So 1965, if you're Pakistani, it looks like a good  
year to settle border problems. And so what they 
do is first they invade through the south, if you  
look way down at the bottom there, the Rana Kuch, 
and that seems to go pretty well. And then they  
decide they want to go for the thing they really 
care about, which is Kashmir, and they do that  
well, the enemy gets the vote. And the Indians 
invaded straight through Lahore, which isn't  
remotely what the Pakistanis had in mind. And then 
the United States does a double arms embargo on  
both of them for doing this. And the problem is 
the Pakistanis are much more dependent on U.S.  
military aid. The Indians were more diversified, 
so they just didn't have enough spare parts to  
continue this thing. So it's a very unhappy event 
for them. They lose it, and what happens, neither  
the United States nor Russia wants either one of 
them fighting that war. The Russians are thinking,  
we want the military aid to go to India in order 
to counterbalance China, not to decimate the  
Pakistanis. And the United States doesn't want it 
either. So the United States is very happy that  
the Soviets broker the Tashkent Declaration that 
ends this war. But Pakistan is worse off after  
this thing. And India has restored its reputation 
for knowing what it's doing on the battlefield. 
So for Pakistan, the United States is really 
problematic because we're interested in being  
nice to them when we want something out of 
them, and then we're not so interested when  
we don't want something out of them because we 
don't share a primary enemy. So what we really  
wanted were listening bases. The technology of 
the day was such that if you want to surveil  
the Soviet Union, you want to send these 
big U2 planes over and given their ranges,  
and you're not supposed to be doing it. And so 
we had U2 bases, I think Norway, West Germany,  
Turkey, Pakistan, and then Japan. And in addition, 
we had a listening base at Badaber. And these are  
really important things for us during this period. 
So we're paying the Pakistanis a lot of money to  
get it. And except there was one of these U2 
planes, gets shot down over the Soviet Union.  
They finally get it so they can. Because they 
fly at really high altitudes, [but] they shoot  
it down. And Khrushchev is furious. He hauls in 
the Pakistani ambassador in Moscow and he goes,  
where is this place Peshawar? We've circled 
it on the map, and we're going to blow it  
off the map if you all don't wise up. And the 
Pakistani is like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. 
And so between these sort of threats in 1960 about 
the U2 and then the United States freezing arms in  
the 1965 war, which the Pakistanis believe they 
lost it over that. Oh, yeah, and by the way,  
in that 1965 war the United States had, when we 
provided arms to everybody, we said, oh, we will  
guarantee that no one uses it, that Pakistanis 
and Indians don't use it against each other. And  
of course, we could do nothing about that. And in 
the 1965 war, the Pakistanis are using US tanks to  
go after Indians in the largest tank war battle 
since World War II. So there are a lot of upset  
people in South Asia. But here is Ayub Khan, 
leader of Pakistan, telling the United States  
that the United States forgets that our security 
hazards and political liabilities have increased  
to a dangerous level due to this U2 stuff. And we 
kept our part of the contract whilst the Americans  
betrayed us at every turn. They built up India 
against us, they failed to help us in the ‘65  
war and finally stopped military aid. They think 
that we exist for their convenience and that our  
freedom is negotiable. Dream on. So when the lease 
came up for the listening post at Badaber in 1968,  
the Pakistanis canceled it. They're sick of it.
Meanwhile, the Indians weren't too thrilled  
about the United States either. This is earlier 
when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president:  
here's Mahatma Gandhi telling him allied support 
for freedom and democracy seems hollow so long as  
America has the Negro problem in her own home. 
Indians were appalled by segregation. They knew  
exactly which end of the bus they'd be sitting 
on. So there are issues both ways. And in fact,  
Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi found the 
United States really impossible to work with. And  
they looked at capitalism as the way station to 
imperialism and fascism, whereas Americans looked  
at socialism as the way station to communism. 
So there's no meeting of minds on all of this.  
And so if you look at the alignments of 
primary adversaries India and Pakistan,  
from most of the time our primary adversaries: 
India is always Pakistan's primary enemy. But you  
could argue that with the ‘62 war, is it Pakistan 
or is it China who is the primary adversary of  
India? And then when you get to the 1971 war, 
which I'll discuss a little more in a second,  
where Bangladesh is broken off and then Pakistan 
is left, has less than half the population,  
then you could argue that for India, China is the 
primary adversary. And then if you look at that  
reshuffling, if you also look at the 1969 war, 
that reshuffles the nuclear powers. So formerly  
Russia and China had shared the United States 
as their primary enemy. But after the ‘69 war,  
they're each other's primary enemy. And this 
gives the United States the swing position of  
team up with A or team up with B. And the United 
States teamed up with China to overextend Russia  
in the Cold War, because I had always felt that 
the Soviets were the bigger threat in those days. 
So anyway, as you're looking at alignments, you 
can apply this kind of framework to any country on  
the planet to try to figure out what's going on. 
And think about how alliances work. If I look at  
The World War II Allies, probably one of the most 
effective alliances in world history, if you think  
about what people ultimately want, the British 
want an empire in which the sun never sets,  
the United States wants to decolonize everybody, 
and Joe Stalin wants a communist wonderland. Those  
are mutually exclusive. But to get there you have 
to go through the common way station of getting  
rid of Hitler. So the common existential threat 
can be a superglue of the most unlikely partners. 
But let's look at the Axis. What they want at 
the end of the war are series of influence in  
different parts of the world. So for Italy, it's 
empire in the Mediterranean, Japan in the Pacific,  
and then Hitler, it's all over Eurasia. That's not 
mutually exclusive. But if you look who they're  
the primary enemy, who stands in the way of those 
plans, it's Britain for Italy, it's Russia, for  
the Germans and for the Japanese, it's first China 
and then the United States. None of it aligns. So  
they fight parallel wars and allow the allies 
to, to take them out in detail. So when you're  
thinking about alliances in the world today, when 
you're wondering what's going on with Iran or  
whatever, figure out who's their real primary 
enemy, get it straight. Does that primary enemy,  
is that an existential threat for them? So if 
you've got countries that line up on same primary  
enemy, existential threat for all around, the most 
unlikely people will cooperate. On the other hand,  
people who are very likely to cooperate, 
maybe like the fascists, they all shared this  
basic ideology. But if they don't have the same 
primary enemy and the same theater of interest,  
geographically the same theater, they may 
not cooperate very well at all. So you  
can apply this to anything you want to apply to.
So back to my game here. If you're looking at the  
cards people have to play. The United States has 
lousy cards because we don't share primary enemies  
with anybody. So it's a stalemate. You help India, 
the Pakistanis hate you. You help Pakistanis,  
the Indians hate you, it's no win. But if you look 
at India, India and Russia share a China problem.  
That's good, they can cooperate on that. And then 
you have Pakistan and China, they share an India  
problem. They can make things happen over that. 
So there are cards for them to play and 0 for the  
United States to play. It's just the way it is. 
So the name of the game and strategy is to get  
the outcome that you want to have happen. And it's 
like, how do you play this game of five person,  
five country cutthroat billiards to get remotely 
what you want out of it? So for the English majors  
among you, I have a metaphor. For the rest of 
you, you can just bear with us. Imagine a game  
in which every ball can be a cue ball and players 
can take turns, come, leave, do whatever at will.  
Sometimes they'll cooperate some of the time, but 
they don't necessarily want to put the same ball  
in the same pocket. And so if that's the case, 
there's going to be no enduring cooperation. And  
understand that you want to have your goal is 
going to be the ultimate shot you want to take.  
But as you're taking the intervening shots, people 
are going to try to disrupt it. How on earth do  
you get through this game? So this is what the 
next section is all about. So if you look at  
this map and where Pakistan's located, it's this 
very strategic location right in the center of,  
not quite center, but of Eurasia, the 
center of the Soviet boundary there. 
And I'm going to give you a map. This is from 
Halford Mackinder. He's one of the finest, most  
famous people to publish on geopolitics. This is 
his 1904 map. It's actually quite famous. And he  
talked about how Russia occupies the heartland. 
In his day it was all these railway systems. He  
thought that was the prime piece of real estate in 
the world. And then it's surrounded by this inner  
marginal crescent. You look where Pakistan's 
located, it's right in the center there,  
right up by Russia. And it's a really crucial 
location before satellite imagery is available,  
to put listening posts on Russia. Russia's 
huge. You gotta have a bunch of listening  
posts to track their missiles and things. 
And then if you want access to Afghanistan,  
which when the Russians go there, we want access, 
and of course, when we go there, we really want  
access. So it's a strategic location. For the 
Pakistanis the United States was so frustrating  
to deal with because we'd be on-and-off interested 
in them because we don't align on a primary enemy. 
So pre-satellite-imagery, we really wanted to 
cozy up to the Pakistanis. So we have U2 bases  
but then there are technology changes. And before 
we get facilities in Iran, we want this listening  
post in Badaber. But technology will eventually 
change. And then for a while, we truly want the  
Pakistanis to get the mail through to China when 
we're trying to break China out of diplomatic  
isolation and then cooperate against the Soviet 
Union, and Pakistan delivers the mail. But then  
we set up an alternate setup in Paris to go 
through our embassies that way, and Pakistan  
is again irrelevant. And then when Russia's 
in Afghanistan, Pakistan's essential to get  
aid to insurgents to cause the Russians trouble. 
And then, of course, when we're in Afghanistan,  
we really want to cooperate with the Pakistanis. 
And that works until we cap Osama bin Laden  
without telling the Pakistanis in their territory, 
Abbottabad. And then relations are really not  
so great. And so it's a very bumpy ride. And in 
these periods when we really need the Pakistanis,  
we don't pay attention to human rights or 
the really big one, nuclear proliferation.  
And so the proliferation is pretty steady.
So if you look at after the United States  
having trouble negotiating all this so that 
whatever you do in the short term doesn't  
wreck you in the long term. But in order to get 
to the long term, of course, you've got to go  
through the short term. So after the U2 crash in 
Russia, where it gets shot down and the Pakistanis  
are having a heart attack about that, that's 
when the Pakistanis look to cultivating more,  
better relations with China because the US 
relationship is just too potentially costly  
and the Americans cut off the military aid. And 
then when the Pakistanis are being very nice  
about delivering the mail for Richard Nixon and 
Henry Kissinger to line up invitations in Beijing,  
the United States is ignoring a humanitarian 
nightmare because all of this that coincides  
with the 1971 Bangladeshi War for independence.
 
So let me explain what that is to you. So Pakistan  
was holding presidential elections. The dominant 
ethnic group in Pakistan are Punjabis, sometimes  
the Sindhis, like the Bhutto family. I think 
they're Sindhi. But anyway, generally speaking,  
particularly the army, the Punjabis dominate. 
Bengalis, live in Bangladesh. They won the  
election and the Punjabis are furious. So they 
send the army to start butchering people in East  
Pakistan to overturn the election. So there 
are refugees pouring into India. So this is  
the backdrop of what is going on there. And for 
anyone who wasn't in the know, the United States  
is saying nothing about this. The United States, 
there's this massive humanitarian crisis in the  
United States. Got nothing to say. The United 
States has Something to say about everything. But  
it had to do with,this is the moment that Nixon is 
trying to get himself invited to Beijing so that  
he can talk to Mao about cooperating. With the 
Soviets. No, with the Chinese. To overextend the  
Soviets in the Cold War, which is ultimately what 
we do. And it's very important to win the Cold  
War. And this is integral to this. But everyone 
else is looking and going, what on earth is going  
on? So you have Nixon's doing the mediation in 
the background. We got refugees flying all over  
the place. India comes to the United States 
and says, look, you need to tell the Chinese  
not to intervene in this thing. And not only 
did we not do that. Oh, the Indians also say,  
you need to bring this up at the UN, the human 
rights stuff, because India is literally getting  
millions of refugees trying to flee this, this 
mess. And the United States won't do any of it.
  
It gets even better. The United States has the 
gall to blame the Indians for the war. Dream on.  
So Indira Gandhi is just furious at this one. And 
so the United States had wished that India would  
cease being non-aligned and align with the West. 
Well, they cease being non-aligned, all right.  
They sign a military pact with Russia over this. 
And then they upgrade their relationship with  
Vietnam, which totally upsets the United States. 
And it gets even better. They shut down Indians.  
They won't give scholars any visas to come 
to India to study India. So you wonder why  
US Universities didn't have any Indian studies 
programs? It's all about this. So that explains  
what's going on with all of that. Total mess.
Meanwhile. But for Pakistan, as all this is  
going on, the Shah of Iran falls in, I think 
it's like February 1979. And then the Russians  
invade Afghanistan in December 1979. And 
suddenly Pakistan is totally essential once  
again. And the Pakistanis are really getting 
sick of being kicked around. So when outgoing  
President Jimmy Carter offers them, I don't 
know, $400 million or something, this is Zia  
here going peanuts to the peanut farmer. And the 
incoming Reagan administration then ups it to $3.2  
billion and that money gets funneled through the 
Inter-Services Intelligence directorate. That's  
like, I don't know – the CIA+++ of Pakistan. 
And when you put that kind of money into that  
kind of bureaucracy, you're going to make them 
incredibly powerful. And then they're the ones  
who decide how they're going to allocate money 
to insurgents in Afghanistan. And I get it. There  
weren't any great choices, but they're arming some 
really anti-Western folks in there, probably some  
guy named Osama, last name Bin Laden. But anyway 
I'm not sure of the details on that one, but it  
is going to have 9/11 follow-on effects. And also 
the Pakistani, the ISI is also taking some of that  
money and putting it into Kashmir which is going 
to have real problems for India later on. So there  
are real ramifications for all of this of needing 
Pakistan. But actually what is happening anyway.  
And then, throughout, there is the Pakistanis 
are getting closer and closer to building  
the bomb. So when the Russians go piling into 
Afghanistan, here's Zbigniew Brzezinski Carter  
national security advisor telling him our security 
policy cannot be dictated by our non proliferation  
policy. Really? I thought that was our security 
policy. And the problem with proliferation is it  
tends to be a one way street whereas Afghanistan 
has been anything but. And then here Deng Xiaoping  
was in town and he told Carter, we applaud your 
decision to basically toss all these proliferation  
human rights considerations for Pakistan and 
just arm them. No kidding. Because the Chinese  
are providing the nuclear spare parts. So the 
United States isn't the only country to have  
trouble navigating this cutthroat billiards. 
The Pakistanis have their share of boomerangs. 
Just look how the wars work. So wars create 
incredible costs. So the 1965 war, the Pakistanis  
get exactly nothing. And the United States, 
Pakistan had been the largest aid recipient  
of the. I'm not sure if I got that right. But 
anyway they're a huge aid recipient from the  
United States. Well after this war were not so 
interested. So that's a lot of money down the  
tubes. And then in 1971 war, great guys, you lose 
Bangladesh which, by the way, has over half your  
population. So Pakistan is no longer the most 
populous Muslim country, Indonesia is. And  
if you look at the Kargil War in 1999, this is 
when Pakistan tries to again go below the line  
of control in Kashmir to try to take some more of 
Kashmir back. Pakistan has to cross right back and  
then it gets sanctioned for all of this. So none 
of these wars have actually worked out very well  
for Pakistan. And then if you think about it, 
India and Pakistan are natural trade partners. 
So if you take all these wars and just add up all 
the costs and then think of the opportunity costs  
if Pakistan had been able to take this money 
and spend it on road systems, on education,  
and then all the lost trade, it gives you a 
sense of the real cost of all of this. Okay,  
well those are Pakistan's Problems. India has 
its own problems. Here you've got Indira Gandhi  
and Richard Nixon, they really didn't like 
each other. I mean look at her, she looks as  
if she's just been fed bad fish and he looks like 
he served it up. And they just, they cannot abide  
by each other. So in the 1940s when Kashmir 
is erupting, Indira Gandhi thinks – well no,  
it's Nehru – her dad thinks that the United States 
should be supporting India because it's secular  
and it's a democracy. And the United States is 
appalled during the Korean War when India remains  
non-aligned instead of supporting the United 
States because it's secular and democratic.  
And the Pakistanis are totally outraged 
because they're looking at this go, okay,  
these Indians are non-aligned. We're aligned. 
We're taking these risks for Peshawar and stuff  
with the U2s and you're helping these people 
who are about to ally with the Soviet Union,  
who are you kidding? So it's a total mess. So 
the Indians have their own self inflicted blows.  
Nehru and his very controversial, but devoted 
advisor Krishna Menon and his daughter Indira  
Gandhi were really good at making these totally 
insulting remarks to American VIPs. Okay, it hits  
the target without a doubt, but the ego that 
has just been hit is huge and like an elephant  
is not about to forget. And meanwhile Pakistan 
in contrast is just being this welcoming host. 
So the United States is going “ugh India and 
Pakistan”. And it makes really bad trend lines for  
India because in the 1962 war the United States 
supported India. In the 1965 war, it's neutral.  
In the 1971 war it supports Pakistan. That's 
not great. And then India's own very heavy  
handed treatment of solutions to the insurgency 
of Kashmir doesn't make that thing go away, it  
just gets worse. So they have their own problems.
China also has its problems with the interaction.  
It's complicated. So on the one hand, 
on the Sino-Indian war, absolutely,  
China gets the territory, but at what cost? You've 
got this permanent enemy forever. And as opposed  
to teaming up with them, if they teamed up, they 
actually would have had incredible leverage for  
what the global order is going to look like. 
But that's just not to be. And moreover,  
if you look at the 1971 war, after the United 
States won't help with China, India's going,  
okay, I think we need nuclear weapons because then 
we'll be able to protect ourselves against China.  
And after that war, when Pakistan's lost over 
half its population and has to deal with Indian  
population and territorial, just overwhelming 
superiority, the Pakistanis go, “I think we need  
nuclear weapons in order to solve this problem”. 
So there's proliferation all over the place. 
But as a result of the 1971 war, where Pakistan 
tries to overturn the elections, here you have  
an Indian defense analyst, Subrahmanyam, saying 
the Pakistani decision to overturn its elections  
by deploying the army to East Pakistan gave India 
an opportunity the like of which will never come  
again. And what they did is they armed insurgents 
in East Pakistan then sent the conventional army  
in and that was it for Pakistan: in East Pakistan 
over. The interaction for Russia works a little  
better. For Russia and India, it's really quite 
a good relationship. What Russia offers to India,  
not only military and economic aid, but also very 
useful vetoes on the UN Security Council. India  
does not want plebiscites in Kashmir that it might 
lose, so it gets the Soviet Union to veto those  
things. So there are no plebiscites. And then 
as India is trouncing Pakistan in the 1970 war,  
starting one war, and the United 
States wants them to halt India,  
no way. India wants to finish the job. So it gets 
the Soviet Union to veto that one. And India does  
indeed finish the job. And meanwhile, for Russia, 
India is really useful. It's a good counterbalance  
for China. So theirs is rather a beautiful 
relationship. They have very cordial relations. 
Okay, so I think I've now covered the playing 
field, right? And I've covered the players and  
teams and their problems with interacting. That's 
very difficult. Now for some of the plays and the  
instruments of national power. And here's the menu 
of choices. You can start with the light items.  
Diplomacy, public support and denial of public 
support. You can move into more expensive things  
down the menu. One of the things you can do is 
help negotiate a really useful treaty, which the  
United States did. It brokered this Indus Waters 
Treaty of 1960. It's the only time that I know of,  
maybe you all know of something, where India and 
Pakistan have signed an agreement to the massive  
benefit of both of them. What does this agreement 
do? You can see it's a really dense river system.  
Both India and Pakistan need to irrigate. To do 
that efficiently, you need dams. And both of them  
were poor and didn't have the dams. They were 
going to cost a billion dollars. And the United  
States was willing to kick in half that money if 
they would both sign the treaty. And no terrorist  
event or anything derailed it, so they signed it. 
And this treaty has been, it's been operating some  
of these dams ever since to the enormous benefit 
of both countries. Does the United States get  
any enduring gratitude from either one for doing 
this? No. Zip. Okay, next one is the United States  
tried to exercise diplomacy and to convince the 
Pakistanis and Indians to settle their differences  
and it was a total flop. And because if you're 
going to try to befriend both India and Pakistan,  
you wind up becoming the enemy of one or the 
other. And the United States diplomacy was based  
on certain false assumptions, which are one, that 
India and Pakistan could be cajoled into settling  
their differences. And their idea is, anyone 
who's so stupid as to think that is crazy. And  
if you're going, well, what are the origins of 
these differences? Partition was brutal. So the  
British colonized the Indian subcontinent and then 
they left in 1947 and they left really rapidly so  
that there was no time to set up any institutional 
framework. And also, you're talking millions of  
people. And so Pakistan's going to be one thing 
and then India's going to be the other. And so  
Hindus are just fleeing and Sikhs are fleeing out 
of Pakistan and Muslims are fleeing out of India,  
going back and forth and millions are killed 
while this is going on. So this is the origin,  
at least the modern origin, of why Pakistanis and 
Indians are so bitter. In addition, the United  
States thought, well, surely the China threat is 
going to make the Indians come around and realize  
this non-aligned stuff's nonsense. Not quite. 
Yeah, When India aligns, it aligns with Russia,  
not the United States. So that doesn't remotely 
work out the way the United States wanted. 
And then the United States thought, well, hey, 
we in the west were rich. We give Indians and  
Pakistanis all this aid. This will force them to 
be nice to us and be less nice to the communists.  
Wrong. India and Pakistan are really astute and 
they get lots of aid from everybody. So when the  
great powers do align, Russia, China, us, or at 
least two of those align, then you can actually  
get stuff done. So that's when you get the 
Tashkent Agreement for the 1965 war. This is: the  
United States and Russia both want India and 
Pakistan to cease and desist and stop blowing  
each other off the map. And also in the Kargil 
conflict, when Pakistan is yet again trying to  
resolve Kashmir by invading and then gets itself 
into trouble. And this guy Nawaz Sharif, who is  
the head of Pakistan, he all of a sudden ups and 
gets on a plane with his family. It looks like  
he's coming into exile and he's trying to fly into 
the United States. And the United States goes,  
whoa, Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what do you think 
you're doing? And says, you're not coming in here  
until you admit that you crossed the line of 
control. And then you need to get right back.  
And so he agrees to sign the Washington agreement 
to go right back. But it's absolutely humiliating  
for the Pakistanis to go, oh, yeah, we went 
south of the line of control. And then, well,  
that didn't work out. So now we have to go right 
back. He had gone to China already and pleaded his  
case to the Chinese, and they told him to get 
right back because there was a lot of nuclear  
saber-rattling going on, and the Chinese were 
not interested in a nuclear war over this. So  
Pakistan had the choice of, okay, fight India by 
your lonesome or cross back. So they crossed back. 
And there were other cases in the inter-Cold-War 
period when the great powers cooperated and tamped  
things down, like terrorist incidents in New 
Delhi and in Mumbai that didn't go anywhere  
because the great powers told the Indians 
and the Pakistanis to just dial it back.  
All right? Another thing you can do is to publicly 
support someone. And this is what goes on with  
Goa, which is a Portuguese colony. The Indians 
wanted it back. The Portuguese said, no way, you  
cannot have it back. And the Indians took it back. 
And the United States supported Portugal. Why?  
It's a NATO ally and we have very important bases 
in Portugal. So we kept the bases, but we made the  
Indians really angry. And there are other areas of 
public support or not criticizing people publicly.  
For instance, when the. In the. In the 1971 
Bangladesh war, when the United States refuses  
to support India by telling China, don't enter 
this place. But of course, it was December,  
so the road system would have been a little 
rough to even try that, but it made the Indians  
mad. Or if you think during the Cold War.
So with Nehru, it's the 1956 Hungarian crisis  
where the Russians sent tanks into Hungary, the 
Indians don't say anything about that. There's  
a Berlin crisis in 1961 where the Russians are 
pretty rough and the Indians don't say anything  
about that. And then Indira Gandhi comes in, and 
when the Russians send tanks into Czechoslovakia  
in 1968, the Indians say nothing. And then when 
the Russians invade Afghanistan in '79, again, the  
Indians say nothing. So this is one way that you 
make your allies feel better about things. Another  
thing is if you're one of the five veto holders 
at the UN Security Council, you can do your public  
support that way. And I've already mentioned these 
Russian vetoes on Kashmiri plebiscites that the  
Indians truly didn't want to have happen, or short 
circuiting the Indian offensive in Bangladesh. So  
this is what Russia did for India, and it was 
a very valuable thing for them. You can also  
put money where your mouth is. Economic aid. And 
it's interesting, the United States provided far  
more economic aid than either the Russians or the 
Chinese, but still, both Pakistanis and Indians  
preferred China and Russia respectively. And some 
of this aid was really important. During the Bihar  
famine in 1967, the United States sent 20% of its 
wheat crop to India. It was worth $1.5 billion.  
That's not something to be sneezed at for, I 
don't know, was it 90 million people? It's a  
lot of people who might have starved to death.
 
And that didn't work out well at all because  
Johnson, at that point, President Johnson at 
that point was so mad at the Indians because  
from his point of view, they were cuddling 
up to the North Vietnamese. And the Vietnam  
War wasn't going well for Johnson. So he was 
furious. So he provided the aid, but he did it  
always at the last minute, ship to mouth.
And Indira Gandhi was furious. She said,  
I don't ever want us ever to have to beg for 
food again. And she never did. So the United  
States got no gratitude or enduring anything. Oh, 
and a whole other piece of it is that India is not  
subject to famines anymore. And part of it's from 
the Green Revolution. And who does that? It's the  
Ford and Rockefeller foundations who figure out 
the different strains of grains that you want to  
grow. And does the United States get any credit 
for that? No, zip. And here is Krishna Menon, who  
is Nehru's controversial advisor, saying, look, we 
want to encourage a little competition between the  
donors. And they did. And India just. Even Indira 
Gandhi, who hates Nixon, she's racking up the aid. 
And back in the Eisenhower administration, the 
United States had noticed. Secretary of State  
John Foster Dulles is saying, look, concerning 
India and Pakistan, it's difficult to help one  
without making the enemy of the other. And 
of course, the United States tried to help  
both and angered both of them. Amazing.
So another instrument of national power  
is military aid. It is even more difficult to 
calibrate than the economic aid. So you can see  
with the pactomania event where Eisenhower 
is building these bilateral relations and  
treaty organizations to contain the Russians. 
Formerly there'd been no Cold War in South Asia,  
but once Eisenhower allies with Pakistan, all of 
a sudden the Russians are in there too. So that's  
a bit of a boomerang. Another one. So when the 
United States provides military aid to Pakistan,  
that just drives India to seeking an alliance 
with Russia, which isn't exactly what the United  
States wanted. And then when the United States 
helps India right after the 1962 war with China,  
that alienates the Pakistanis and then they 
try to buddy buddy with China, not remotely  
what the United States wanted to happen. And then 
when the United States provides aid to the ISI,  
the Inter Services Intelligence Directorate, 
which is the Pakistanis then are funding things  
to get the Russians out of Afghanistan, they're 
also diverting it into Kashmir. So in 1989 this  
insurgency heats up and it's remained heated ever 
since. And then you wind up with China providing  
nuclear help to the Pakistanis. So it's difficult 
with these things. You get a short term thing,  
but then the long term thing that winds 
up may not be what you want at all. 
The other instrument of national power, if you 
got one, is the carrier battle group. You can  
send one of those around, which is what the United 
States did. Here's Enterprise. It was the United  
States’ first nuclear propelled aircraft carrier. 
And so during the ‘71 war, the United States sent  
this into the Bay of Bengal, the Russians sent 
some naval assets, had no effect on that war:  
Pakistan lost. Right. The Indians were furious. 
They just regarded this as an absolute threat.  
And how dare we do this anyway? And maybe it 
would have been better to have left Enterprise  
in their home port rather than doing this.
And then of course there's sanctions and  
embargoes. The United States does this all the 
time. And if you look at the list of the times  
we're embargoing stuff. So at partition we're 
embargoing everybody. And then during the ‘65  
war we're embargoing everybody. And then as 
various people are making nuclear progress and  
different things, there are these embargoes that 
come and go. And Pakistan's really mad because  
India does a test, an atomic test in 1974 and 
Pakistan doesn't do anything until much later.  
And it's looking why are you sanctioning us on 
this nuclear stuff? The Indians have actually  
done this. We haven't. And so if you look at this 
chart, you can see where the ups and downs of  
these sanctions go. And clearly they didn't stop 
proliferation because in 1998 you have these tit  
for tat nuclear atomic tests by both and the 
United States tries sanctioning, but then it's  
just too late. They've already tested the stuff. 
And so the United States basically gives up and  
then after 9/11, of course, we desperately 
need Pakistan again to deal with Afghanistan.  
So it's a complicated world out there.
So another instrument of national power  
is you can trade off your territory if 
you really want to. Most people don't,  
but the Pakistanis clearly did that in 1963. And 
we can all speculate on what they got. I mean,  
my hunch would be something to do with nuclear 
things, but hey, it's not as if this information  
is out there in the public. It isn't.
Oh, another thing you can do is go  
fund the insurgency. So you can. And this is 
done by the United States, Russia, China, India,  
Pakistan. Think if you've got a country that you 
don't like that has some minority people that  
want to secede and so they're fighting there, 
well, you can go fund that insurgency and then  
the one you don't like is pinned, because they're 
going to be paying attention to that insurgency.  
And while they're pinned there, they can't 
probably do things elsewhere that you might  
care about. So this is the logic of what's going 
on. So the United States belatedly decided, ah,  
let's help the Tibetans. And so the CIA is helping 
them between ‘57 and ‘61. But look at the dates we  
did the road system. The road system in Tibet's 
completed by 1957. It's too late. So all you do  
is get these people killed because the Chinese 
have got the road system all set up in there.
  
So that doesn't exactly work. But after the ‘62 
war, all the way until 1979, when Deng Xiaoping  
calls it off, the Chinese are funding insurgencies 
of, let's see, the Mizos, the Manapuri and the  
Naga people all don't like different aspects of 
Indian rule. And the Chinese are more than happy  
to stir that pot. And the really big pot to 
stir are the Naxalites. It's huge. And while  
as long as the Pakistanis have got East Pakistan, 
they can stir some of that up. And by the way,  
these Naxalites are still there in India. 
They have not gone away. It's a serious  
part of India where they are. And then, of 
course, Pakistan's location right next to  
Kashmir means they can stir that forever.
And the tragedy of these, what they  
become are frozen conflicts. Is the outside 
power. if they are playing their cards right,  
their amoral cards right, they're not bearing any 
of the costs. They're pinning someone they don't  
particularly like. All the costs are borne 
by the local population who are suffering  
horrendous deaths, lack of economic growth. 
You're just having warfare where you live.  
What a total disaster. So that's how it works.
… two can play at this game. So the Indians,  
according to the Pakistanis, have funded the 
Baloch people. They straddle Iran and Pakistan,  
don't particularly like being told what to do. So 
apparently India's supposed to have put its finger  
on that scale. The other thing the Pakistanis 
accuse Indians of doing is encouraging a Pashtun  
insurgency up north. And that would be a way of 
diverting Pakistani attentions from Kashmir. If  
they're totally busy with Pashtuns, they can 
do less in Kashmir. But the result of these  
things is people are becoming more and more 
bitter. The hatreds just spike, the economic  
growth isn't happening, poverty everywhere. And it 
makes these problems more intractable, not less. 
So when I think about these frozen conflicts, 
there are a number of ones that you know about  
besides Kashmir, there's Korea, there's Palestine. 
So if you look at Kashmir, if I've got it right,  
so you fund that thing. And then what's great from 
China's point of view, if Pakistan is doing that  
India is frozen, that it can't do other things 
because it's constantly paying attention to what's  
going on in Kashmir as opposed to going “hmmm 
China, I don't know about this”. Or in the Korean  
War back in the day, if things are all stirred 
up in Korea, China has to really pay attention  
to that. And it delays the rise of China. And in 
those days that benefited Russia. But these things  
can change over time as to who the beneficiary 
is. And then you can play this game and think  
about how it works in Palestine. And I'm no expert 
in that part of the world, but I think this frozen  
conflict veto player works, that there are these 
veto players who are vetoing peace very easily.  
All you have to do is send a certain number of 
package bombs and peace is not going to happen. 
So, cutthroat billiards. What can you take away 
from all this? Well, common enemies cannot be  
conjured. So check out the alignments of who these 
common enemies are before you leave the parking  
lot and figure it out for all possible players who 
might want to crash the party. Like, what's their  
primary objective? Who's their primary adversary? 
What primary theater are they truly interested in?  
And then you've got your hunches on how you think 
this is. And then you should reassess early and  
often to see if your assumptions are correct and 
don't worry about changing your mind. Some people  
get really hung up about being wrong. Don't worry. 
Reassessing is a sign of strength. It's like,  
I got more information, I've changed my mind. 
Good thing, don't double down on bad information.  
And then if you're looking into areas of the world 
that are ethnically diverse where people have been  
at odds for a long time, expect veto players and 
real difficulty in settling that matter out. And  
part of good strategy is recognizing some problems 
it's not feasible to solve. And then we all have  
scarce resources. You can't do everything. Focus 
on those things where you think you can solve. But  
if the great powers align, things can happen. 
And the story is even better than that. That,  
sure there are a few big powers, but the small 
and medium powers, if you add them all up,  
are by far the aggregate. Their aggregate wealth 
exceeds any one great power. So if the smaller  
powers agree on what they're up to, then the 
big powers have to pay attention. And that's  
a positive thing. So that is what I had to say 
to you this evening and thank you for listening. 
Q&A
So it seems like the lesson from this lecture,  
the big lesson, is we couldn't be allies with both 
Pakistan and India at the same time. We had to  
choose one. So which one should we have chosen?
Oh, well, our primary enemy was pretty much the  
Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War. I 
mean, China was a problem, but the Soviets were  
the big problem. And so India and Pakistan never 
fit that bill. And so it had to do with whatever  
the problem of the day was. And Pakistan had a 
very critical location, and so we needed it for  
a whole bunch of things, and you can see how that 
works. While you need them, you pay a lot of money  
to them, and presumably the money's worth it for 
them for the hassles of dealing with a difficult  
tenant. So that's how it worked. But nowadays, 
the relationship with India is changing. In fact,  
it has changed because their big buddy Russia is. 
Well, after the end of the Cold War, instead of  
being the big friend, it was the big nuisance, 
not so much for India, but for everybody else.  
And now for India, its primary adversary is China, 
without a doubt. And the United States, I think,  
is looking at China poses the primary threat. And 
to the extent that both of them see it that way,  
that will make them align and Pakistan less so.
It sounds like at the time it was right to choose  
Pakistan as the main ally for the United States.
Well, we tried to choose India too, but yeah,  
we tried to do them simultaneously, but 
India's further south, right. And so for  
a long time before we got satellite imagery, 
you want to have listening posts and things  
up in Pakistan. So India just simply doesn't 
have the location for that. So that was the  
original reason for interest in Pakistan.
I want to better understand why the Soviet  
Union was such a charismatic example for 
countries that were decolonizing like India. 
Well, I think go back and put yourself as 
a generation of what your life experience  
was. If your life experience was World War I, the 
total butchery of it. So you're telling young men  
your age “go” – you're in a trench – “I want you 
to go up and over the edge into oncoming machine  
gun fire”. We know what's going to happen when 
that happens, right? And they're literally in  
battles like the Somme, they're losing hundreds 
of thousands of people. I don't mean casualties,  
I mean dead, dead. And so, and then you have the 
Great Depression afterwards and then add to it,  
India's been colonized by a bunch of really 
opinionated white people, right? And transferring  
a lot of wealth out of India to England.
And so you look at Marxism and boy,  
it sounds plausible, right? It sounds like 
these evil capitalists, they're just wasting  
lives. And surely this is the explanation. Now 
the technicalities of Marx's labor theory of  
value don't actually turn out to be accurate. 
It's not just labor that produces value like  
Silicon Valley, you understand, it's what comes up 
here that produces a tremendous amount of value.  
And Marxist theory doesn't recognize that. And so 
there are massive flaws in theory. And then when  
you put communism into practice, if you want 
to have equality, which is what they wanted,  
if you can have equality, you're not going to have 
any liberty, right? Because in order to make it  
equal, you just expropriate and then you divvy it 
out to everybody and there's no liberty in that,  
right? And another piece about democracies and 
even flawed ones, even if they have a semi-free  
press, a lot of the icky news bubbles up, 
but in dictatorships it doesn't, right? 
So you compare the seamy sides of some democracies 
that aren't doing that well. And then to the  
public, the PR thing that the dictatorships 
are presenting. So you can picture Nehru  
of his generation, he's sick of the British. 
Right? And so Fabian socialism. He's not for  
killing lots of people to impose socialism. 
He has a much lighter touch than Stalin. 
One thing I was thinking about while you were 
mentioning the Gandhi and Nehru had a big problem  
with American segregation is at the same time in 
the ‘50s, by that point over 10% of the Soviet  
population had at some point been in the gulags 
or are currently in the gulags. And segregation  
is very bad, Gulags are even worse. And it's 
the same proportion of the population that's  
been in the gulags. Maybe people just 
didn't know about the gulags back then. 
I don't think communists let you know those 
things. Right. This is one for a lot of  
Russians because my husband and I were in the 
Soviet Union in the 1988/89 academic year and  
that's early Gorbachev before everything totally 
falls apart and there's no food. So there was,  
there wasn't much food, but there was some 
food. And it was just as the Russians were  
suddenly being able to read in fairly free press 
about the things that had happened. And they were  
appalled about what had gone on under Stalin 
and they just hadn't realized all of it. 
One of the reasons that socialism was appealing 
to these decolonizing countries was because in  
the preceding decades, from the ‘20s to ‘40s, 
the Soviet Union actually had pretty good growth  
rates. In those 20 years, their GDP went from 8% 
to 18% of world production. Was that just catch-up  
growth? What was going on by the time Russia did?
Well, there was tremendous rebuilding after World  
War II. There's another piece. It was so weird 
when we were in Russia in 88, 89, anything that  
was sold at the markets that came from somewhere 
else, they would market means imported. So the  
idea, and I remember thinking this is really weird 
because normally you would say it's, I don't know,  
Hungarian this and that or whatever. I thought, 
ooh, this means that anything from somewhere else  
is better than what we got, that it's a really bad 
sign. And they had what I would call a doughnut  
empire. Normally when you think of an empire, 
mother Central is the most developed part. And  
then there's the periphery where all the natural 
resources are taken away. That it was an inverted  
empire. Russia is the donut. The rich places 
are places like Czechoslovakia and Poland had  
been much richer places. And so the Russians 
– serf owners – are sucking in all the wealth  
from these places. And I think that's another 
reason why the shattering of the Soviet Union  
when they lost all of their enserfed Eastern 
Europe, why it was such a mess for Russia,  
they did not realize, and they still don't realize 
the degree to which they were living off the  
wealth, product produced in the west, the European 
portions of Russia that since became independent. 
Who was the last Soviet leader 
who truly believed in communism? 
Gorbachev was a true believer. He did not 
believe it was possible to take a U turn  
on the road to communism, so that when he was 
doing his reforms, it was to improve communism,  
make it better. So he absolutely believed in it.
When you started your career in Soviet studies and  
you're trying to figure out like what's 
going on in the Kremlin all the time,  
what is it? What is the key to figuring 
out Kremlinology? What is the key to  
figuring out what's happening in the Politburo?
Well, what I did for my doctoral dissertation,  
so I wrote a history of the Sino. Well, the 
Russo-Chinese border, when it was figured out,  
which is between 1858 and 1924, this is when all 
this territory went. And what I did is. So most of  
this isn't Soviet, right? It's 17 to 24 is the 
Soviet part. But you go to archives in Russia,  
you see what they'll let you see. This is when 
you could go to those archives. They're closed  
now. And I went to Beijing, saw the archives 
you were allowed to see. And then in Nanjing,  
there were some other ones there. And then in 
Taiwan, the ones they would allow you to see,  
and then Japan, the ones they would allow you to 
see. And they're all lying about different things  
or covering up different things. So it's a jigsaw 
puzzle. You put it together that way. So that was  
how I did it. And also for the whole Kremlinology 
is pay attention to what dictators say because  
they've got to communicate at some level to their 
own populations. They quite often tell you exactly  
what they want to do and you think that's insane. 
Who would do that? Well, hello. Hello. Right,  
so read what they have to say and read what others 
have to say. Then you need to read things in the  
Russian language. So I just, I read a lot of 
things. Just read broadly, read more broadly,  
than whatever your topic is, because it's the 
unknown unknowns is what you're after. What are  
the things that are truly important and you have 
no idea about? And the only way you get to those  
is archives or reading broadly where you bump 
into things. Ooh, that turns out to be important. 
When you were giving the lecture, it seemed like 
these primary adversaries, whoever it is, is  
like very permanent. And there's some, like, deep 
reason why it has to be this way. But if you look  
at the Sino Soviet split, it's just like they're 
both Communist, they're both Leninist parties,  
and they have this falling out over. There were a 
couple of things you mentioned, but it's not clear  
why somebody has to be somebody else's primary 
adversary or why you can't turn that around. 
Well, you can, but Russia and China have these 
territorial differences and the issues I listed  
there of fighting to the last Chinese in the 
Korean War, Mao didn't really like that. There are  
a lot of Chinese who die in the Korean War where 
the Russians sort of get them in there and then  
you're stuck. You have to, for prestige reasons, 
stay there. And the really big one I didn't  
discuss in any detail. So Stalin's really worried 
about a two front war. Nazis in the west and  
Japanese in the east. And so he brokers the second 
United Front between the Chinese Nationalist under  
Chiang Kai Shek and the Chinese Communists under 
Mao at a place called Xi'an in late 1930. Wait,  
is it 36? And so it's called the Xi'an Incident 
where Chiang Kai Shek was reputedly kidnapped  
and up there. But really what's going on is it's 
setting up the second United Front. And then the  
Japanese go ballistic and that's when they invade 
all the way down the coast and up the Yangtze  
River. And that means the Chinese are fighting the 
Japanese for you. The Japanese are not going to  
launch into Siberia. So that works for Stalin. But 
the Chinese realize this and it's not appreciated. 
Yeah, but then they helped the 
Communists get into power in China,  
right? You think they'd be grateful for that?
No, no, he wanted to divide China. He's telling  
Mao, oh, stop at the Yangzi stock 
at the Yang. You need a breathing  
space there. And Mao's and keeps on going.
If you're the president, if you're the Secretary  
of State and you're looking at this, where there's 
these interweaving systems of alliances and you  
give some guy aid because you need something 
and pisses everybody else off, how the Hell are  
you supposed to keep track of this? Do they have 
these matrices that you got up there? And they're… 
We have so many wonderful people working 
in the State Department. I've met a number  
of them because they come, they're students 
at the War College. You should be proud of  
all the people who work for the Department of 
State. They're all of these different experts,  
different parts of the world. They get sent around 
hither and yon, very thoughtful people. Also I've  
read in the archives many CIA reports because 
I've gone to these presidential archives starting  
with the Truman administration all the way up to 
Bush Senior. As you get to the more recent stuff,  
less of it's been declassified. So the…I've read 
most of the CIA reports I've read are for earlier  
periods where they've been declassified. It's 
impressive the level of analysis. And I know that  
the CIA has several…there's the analytical part 
of it and then there's the send people out to do,  
we aren't even going to talk about what 
they're, which is completely different.  
But they're very fine analysts. And then we have 
like the Department of Agriculture has very fine  
analysts about agriculture, the whole world. So 
we have a tremendous amount of expertise. And  
the other thing that presidents get and 
also the high level bureaucrats get are  
these daily reports where they're very short 
because they have to be about what's going on  
everywhere in the world that people think 
is important for them to know. So there  
are a tremendous number of smart, well educated 
people trying to get information to presidents,  
secretaries of states and things. And then you 
have all these regional desks where there's I  
don't know, I can't remember exactly. I don't know 
the organization chart of the State Department.  
But you can look at it by region of the world. 
People work there and, and provide this. So there  
are wonderful experts that are working on this.
You mentioned in the lecture that if China and  
India had figured out a way to work together, 
the world order could have looked completely  
different. Spell out the counterfactual 
for us. How would it have been different? 
So I spent the grand total of a week in India. It 
was a trip on the way back from Australia and that  
was the amount of time we had. But we went into 
the Mahatma Gandhi Museum in New Delhi and there's  
a whole piece of it where Chiang Kai-shek 
is giving him things. And it became really  
clear that Chiang Kai-shek had a really good 
relationship with India. Deep respect for India.  
This shared desire of we want to be independent, 
we don't want Japanese running around our country,  
we don't want a bunch of Westerners running 
around. We share this with India. And so I think  
if you get Chiang Kai-shek winning the Chinese 
civil war and things, you might have had them team  
up and had a much more productive relationship.
That's interesting because often you think of like  
when you hear Nationalists, you think they're the 
ones that are interested in territorial disputes,  
but in fact, you know, they wouldn't 
have cared about Tibet or something. 
Well, next time you're in New Delhi, go check out 
the museum. But when I was there it was like 20  
years ago, but I remember being impressed, 
wow, there's all. And then when Gandhi was  
assassinated, this is Mahatma, not the Indira 
who's also assassinated. No relations. That  
the Chinese, the nationalists sense all sorts 
of condolences and different things. So yeah,  
there could have been a different outcome.
I wonder if the worst thing about the Non-Aligned  
Movement was that because they wouldn't 
fall under anyone else's nuclear umbrella,  
they wouldn't align with the great power that 
had nukes. In order to keep up deterrence,  
they had to build nukes themselves. And so 
then you have this nuclear proliferation and  
that was like it's really important to get people 
allied with one great power, even if it's not you,  
just to prevent the nukes from going wide.
I think the 1962 war made Nehru realize that  
non-alignment was a non-starter. And that's for 
the reasons you're talking about. It's like, okay,  
we just got eaten alive by the Chinese. Okay, we 
need a big friend, and we probably need some big  
missiles eventually. And it's not immediately. 
The Indians don't come around that “we absolutely  
need nuclear weapons” until the Bangladesh 
war when China's become more of a threat. 
By 1971 like did Nehru really think that the 
Soviet Union might still win the Cold War? 
Nehru's dead in like ‘64, so it's his daughter.
When did they become allies with the Soviet Union? 
Well, the official alliance, I'm just 
defining, I made up what an alliance  
is. So I would say it is the security 
pact that Indira Gandhi signs in 1971. 
Right. So at that point, did they really 
thought the Soviet Union could have won  
the Cold War? Like, why didn't they 
just choose the winner in retrospect? 
Oh, well, I remember the Cold War vividly. We 
felt we were losing it most of the way through. 
And why is that?
Well, we always felt –  
because of the propaganda, right? – that “they're 
all living beautifully”. And then they're quite  
good, they're very good at propaganda. So the 
United States had massive racial problems. Think  
about the 1960s. Martin Luther King are pointing 
out hideous problems with this country. Civil  
rights demonstrations everywhere, anti Vietnam War 
demonstrations everywhere. The women's movement,  
the environmental movement. There are loads of 
unhappy people pointing out all of these problems,  
which is a good thing because then the United 
States starts working on fixing some of these  
problems. Of course they're not fixed, but there's 
improvement on them. Whereas in Russia, no one can  
travel, so you can't see how unbelievably poor 
they are. And so you go to Moscow and you think,  
well, this is a plausible city. Well, there is 
only one plausible city in the place. Or maybe  
it's two. Saying Petersburg. Well, it's Leningrad 
in those days. So people didn't realize. But yeah,  
we felt we were losing the Cold War. In fact, at 
the very end of the Cold War, because I was in the  
Bush archives. So Gorbachev's in and Bush, Reagan, 
and then Bush are thinking, well, he just looks  
like another one of these people and we're not 
going to take the propaganda seriously. And then  
they sort of go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And then 
it's in 88 where Bush is going, whoa, maybe it is  
going to end. And then the United States teams 
up with Helmut Kohl of Germany to do the fastest  
get the Russians out of Eastern Europe ever. But 
Gorbachev is the one who wants to cooperate with  
the West. One thing you should know about warfare, 
you think the winners win it. No, actually,  
it's when the losers decide they've had enough. 
That's when a war ends. Otherwise it doesn't end.  
So the Russians got sick of it and they quit.
I wonder if there's a lesson in here for what  
people call the “Cold War with China” today, where 
people think it's really competitive, China might  
have a bigger economy than us soon. And really, 
if you actually got to see what's happening day  
to day in China, maybe you might decide, like the 
Soviet Union, there's a bunch of things broken  
with it. They're not really competitive in the 
long run economically. And so we're going to win. 
Well, I don't know, win, lose. But they have a 
very low per capita standard of living. Do the  
math. You go, yeah, they've got a big economy 
because they're, they're not a third of the  
world's population now, but it's, it's huge. 
And divide the 1.3 billion, whatever it is,  
you come up with a low number for per capita 
standard of living. And I think for human beings,  
that's the number that matters, right. 
Of what is your family income look like?  
So they got a long way to go on that one.
I want to go back to Kissinger in 1971. So  
because they want somebody to like, send the 
message along to China to open up, they shut  
up about Pakistan's genocide. In Bangladesh, where 
numbers vary, but somewhere between 300,000 and 3  
million people died.
It's awful. 
Hundreds of thousands of people were 
raped. I know they didn't have email  
back when there was no other way to get the 
message across. You have to abet a genocide  
in order to get a message across to Mao.
Well, first of all, the Cold War is a  
misnomer because the bloodshed in the third world 
was horrendous. And I will eventually compile the  
stats on this. Not that they're great stats, but 
it's obscene numbers. I think Congo had a civil  
war where literally over 10 million people died. 
And that's only just one of these things. So the  
United States cannot deal with all of these. 
And if you think about it, the time when the  
United States was really quite idealistic, 
the Iraq war, goes in, they create democracy  
in this place. It's a massive civil war, and then 
we're blamed for it. So be careful about where you  
intervene because you may not be able to stop a 
thing and then you'll get blamed for what's going  
on. So Bangladesh is horrible, but it is not our 
fault. You will get overextended if you intervene  
in everything under the planet. Also, there's a 
question of why the United States or anyone should  
be doing all of it. Shouldn't it be through the UN 
and other things? The really key thing was winning  
the Cold War. So Nixon absolutely did prioritize 
getting the mail through to Mao. He did. So 1971,  
good old Henry, “Hack”, as he's known in the 
archives, Henry A. Kissinger. He gets his secret  
trip in there, lines up Nixon's trip in ‘72, and 
then it's going to overextend Russia in the Cold  
War. Why? Because with this Sino, Soviet split 
and all the rest of it, Russia has to militarize  
its entire border with China. It's already 
militarized its entire border with Europe.  
Right. Think about this. And you're talking about 
mechanized nuclear armed forces with all the tanks  
and everything else that goes with them. It is not 
cheap. Imagine if the United States had to do this  
on our Canadian and Mexican borders. Bankrupting, 
right? And we're a lot richer than they are. So  
we team up with China, we provide them all kinds 
of naval technology, which is not going to bother  
us. They give us listening posts again, we 
love listening posts right up on the Russian  
border. And the Russians are scared stiff of the 
Chinese. The Chinese with good military equipment,  
that wouldn't be a good thing for them.
When I asked how was President and he  
built these bases in Pakistan to have the U2 
planes go to Russia. We had bases in Turkey,  
we had bases in Japan, we had bases in a lot of 
other places in Europe. This marginal increase in  
coverage, was it really worth breaking off the 
alliance with India or like pissing off India? 
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry, India. I think at the 
time people felt we absolutely have to be able to  
cover everything. And I don't know the details 
of where they had their nuclear this and that  
stored and things and all their testing areas. 
But I'm sure you needed to have the entire place  
covered. And so, yeah, it was very serious on 
these nuclear weapons. They can reach the United  
States. So we had better know what's going on.
So new books about the Cold War are coming out  
all the time. New books about World War II are 
coming out all the time. People are writing like  
thousands of papers about this stuff all the time. 
How much new stuff are we learning every year?  
All these scholars are still setting this up. 
What kinds of new things do we keep unearthing? 
Well, I'm personally sick of writing about 
World War II. I've done enough of it and so I'm  
personally not going in that direction. Yeah, it's 
endless. I think for a lot of the books of these  
narrative feel good histories. Like I'll tell you 
about some Regimen and all the heroic stuff they  
did. And it's nice, light, airplane read. And a 
lot of people like that stuff. I personally like  
things where I learn things that are conceptual 
that I can then apply to other problems which  
those books wouldn't help me, but that's just me.
How do you decide which are the good history  
books and which aren't? You're just 
on Amazon. You can't like, read it  
yet. You're just like, looking out on Amazon.
It's hard. What I would say is give it a book.  
The 30 second test. And what's that? If the book's 
about another part of the world, flip through  
the bibliography, which you can do on Amazon, and 
zing through there for about 30 seconds and see is  
there anything in the language of the country in 
question in the bibliography, like, how much? And  
if there is zip, I would toss it. I'm curious how 
many of you would be interested in reading a book  
that says it knows everything about the United 
States and there's not a single English source  
cited? I think you'd regard the book as garbage, 
and that Americans do this routinely. And it's a  
problem with political science degrees where it 
would be very easy to require anyone who's going  
to do a specialty in comparative politics or IR 
international relations that, hey, you need to  
pass a language test. And don't try Spanish if 
you think you're going to talk about the Middle  
east. Right? If it's going to be Middle east, it 
better be something like Arabic, Farsi, Turkic,  
Hebrew. And better yet, if you're really going to 
be a serious Middle Eastern expert, try all four.  
Right? I mean, that would be true expertise and 
where you can read books in the language and get  
what other people are thinking about things. 
So that would be my basic is find people who  
aren't playing half court tennis all about 
Team America. Get to the other side of the  
net and try and figure out what other people 
are thinking. Doesn't mean you have to agree  
with them, but it means you are making the 
effort to see where they’re coming from. 
During the Cold War, all these proxy 
wars, was it good that we were just  
like letting off steam in these smaller ways and 
therefore we could avoid the bigger great War? 
It wasn't letting off steam. It was horrendous. 
I don't know the answer. In fact, my current  
project is a history of the Cold War and I've 
read a lot of things and I will, I'm going to  
compile a lot of tables on things like this. Just 
putting the data together, it'll take a long time,  
but then when you get the table, it'll be a 
really quick, really quick skim. So if you've got  
a civil war turning somewhere in Latin America 
or somewhere in Africa, so no one's aiding it,  
fine. Then if you have Russia put its finger 
on the scale, then of course we're going to  
put our finger on the scale. So that means the 
Russians are providing industrial age weapons,  
we're providing Industrial age weapons. What 
happens? Casualties just go through the roof.  
And that's what went on through the Cold 
War. And then there was this magical inner  
Cold War period when all that stopped. And 
that's when you get this tremendous growth  
across the third World because there aren't 
these insurgencies just tearing up wealth. 
And then you could see recently, look 
at North Africa – it's a mess right now,  
right? It's both ISIS or whatever it is in there 
doing its stuff, and then you have Wagner group  
or whatever they are in there, and then you have 
the Chinese further south and everybody's feeling  
everything. You got civil war all over the place. 
And then that means military age males want to get  
out because people kill you, right? Or they'll 
either dragoon you into fighting where you don't  
want to fight, or they'll just kill you outright. 
So they're all trying to get into boats to Europe,  
which is destabilizing. It's a mess. We're in 
the second Cold War and this is part of it. 
What was the biggest, when you're doing this 
project on the Cold War, what were the biggest  
miscalculations that people were making? 
Were they too suspicious of the other side?  
Were they not suspicious enough? Were they too 
concerned about bases or what were they missing? 
I need to think more about that because I think 
there are probably all sorts of things. And  
also it's impossible to know the right thing to 
do. And then afterwards, when it pans, you go,  
well, that was a mess. It's hard to know, but 
I think it was probably a terrible mistake when  
Eisenhower thought, here's the Supreme Command 
allied commander of World War II, who knows all  
about hot wars, doesn't want to do that. When the 
United States deposes Mosaddegh in Iran in 1954,  
I could see Eisenhower's view as, hey, we're 
just deposing one guy and we're going to avoid  
the Russians taking oil fields here, etc. And 
he thinks that's a better trade off. Well, the  
Iranians have never forgotten that they're furious 
to this day. Wouldn't you be if you're Iranian?  
Mosaddegh was democratically elected. Or another 
time, actually, in Vietnam, we didn't want to  
hold, we didn't push the South Vietnamese to hold 
elections because we knew Ho Chi Minh would win.  
He was the only national figure in Vietnam. So 
the United States is all about free elections. The  
Vietnamese could have run a free election and Ho 
Chi Minh would have won. That was our assessment,  
that he would win. Okay, well, if you're for free 
elections, it means you don't get the outcome you  
want. And I wonder if that wasn't a terrible 
mistake, because the Vietnamese actually can't  
stand the Chinese. So they were always going to 
be a counterbalance to the Chinese. But due to the  
McCarthy era, we purged all of our China experts. 
All these children of missionaries who knew a  
great deal about China, less so about Vietnam, 
but at least it's a related cultural group. So  
we had gotten rid of all that expertise in the 
McCarthy era. So we're running blind in Asia. 
What you just mentioned about the fact that we 
would curtail what kinds of elections you can  
hold in these countries after Germany and 
Japan surrendered, if they tried to elect  
another fascist party, we wouldn't have been like, 
all right, well, that's what you guys voted for.  
They're in charge now. We would have, you know. 
And so why is the principle different in Vietnam? 
Because the South Vietnamese would have voted 
for them as well. We've just been fighting a  
massive war with Japan and Germany. There's no 
way we're going to let the Germans and Japanese  
decide anything initially. But what we did 
do for both Germany, our half, West Germany,  
and Japan is we did our best to set up democratic 
institutions that within a cycle or two, they're  
making their decisions, whom they're electing, we 
are not choosing their leaders. And it was a very  
generous peace. It was realizing In World War 
I, ostracizing Germans, ostracizing Russians,  
it probably doesn't. You need to bring 
them back into the family of nations,  
because they're on the planet. They're not leaving 
the planet. And the generous peace with Germany,  
look at them. They're the most wonderful 
allies, as are the Japanese. They're terrific. 
During the Cold War, the USSR is constantly 
funding these communist parties around the world,  
and these parties are doing, like, exactly 
their bidding. Whatever Stalin says they'll do. 
I don't know about that.
Yeah, Feel free to clarify, but it doesn't feel  
like any other country managed to pull this off. 
There's not like an American party in the French  
parliament that does exactly what the president 
would tell them to do. How did they pull this off? 
I don't think it's that they did exactly what 
anyone wanted. What the Communists have is  
a really powerful doctrine for how you go from 
nothing to something in a failing state. How you  
start out with a bunch of people on some campus. 
Mao literally starts out as a junior librarian in  
Beijing University. So I don't know, he's there 
with the librarians, I don't know the ladies. Who  
knows what it is? It's probably guys in those 
days. And then he's turning these people into  
cadres and eventually to guerrillas and eventually 
conventional army. But they have a really good  
program that works the world over, and it's very 
effective for taking power within a broken state.  
It's lousy at producing prosperity thereafter. 
Right. And you look at the Communist Party today,  
they're really good at staying in power. For 
a while there, under Deng Xiaoping, it ran in  
parallel what the economic reforms needed to be to 
produce wealth and what the Party needed in order  
to be more powerful. But now that's running 
at cross purposes, because for the party to  
maintain its monopoly, well, all these much more 
educated Chinese aren't going to be interested  
in that anymore. And so it's time to lock those 
people up. And then you're going to have trouble  
with keeping your economic growth rate going.
Mao dies, and immediately things improve. China  
experiences its growth trajectory. Stalin dies, 
and you know Khrushchev is not a teddy bear,  
but at least you cut down the Gulag system. And 
so it does seem like if you have an especially  
bad dictator, you do have this sort of regression 
to the mean, where the next guy's probably not as  
bad as the worst guy who's ever been in charge of 
the country. And I wonder if that implies that,  
you know, if we got rid of Kim Jong 
Un or the Ayatollah or something,  
the next guy probably won't be as bad.
I don't know. But I think iconic leaders  
like Mao and Stalin, they were canonized by 
winning their wars, Stalin by winning World War  
II. The Russians revered him for doing that. And 
they had experienced. Every Russian experienced  
World War II. It was central to their lives to 
win that thing. So Stalin is canonized for doing  
that. And now the man who puts Humpty Dumpty back 
together again when no one else could and then  
fights the great powers, capitalist powers, to 
a stalemate in Korea, he's again been canonized.  
Whoever comes after them is not going to have that 
level of prestige. It's just going to devolve.  
That's period. And then for the successors 
of Stalin, they were sick of being terrified  
about whether they were going to be purged. 
He kept putting bullets in people's heads,  
like Vladimir Putin. You do this long enough 
that people are horrified and don't want to  
have it. They don't want to live that way 
anymore. So there's that piece of it as well. 
I guess I'm not sure what the answer is today. 
If you found out tomorrow that Putin is dead,  
is your estimation that things 
are going to improve or get worse? 
My estimation in that kind of system is there's 
going to be a leadership struggle. That's the  
problem with dictatorships. They're absolutely 
brittle. And that's what's wonderful about having  
elections. You just every four years or whatever 
it is, you have an election. Whoever it is,  
it's going to be whatever it is. But in these 
dictatorships, no one knows. And so everyone.  
So Stalin, literally, I think he didn't show up 
at breakfast. No one wanted to open the door.  
And then probably they decided, let's not open the 
door. Let's just let that door stay shut for a few  
days. And then when it starts stinking, well, no, 
perfect. So that's how he dies. So you're going to  
be guaranteed a free for all. So if there's 
a free for all for something like Ukraine,  
they will probably have to call that off because 
they got to focus on Moscow. That's what happened  
with the Korean War. Why is the Korean War and 
Stalin dies? Russians want it over because they  
got all kinds of unrest. Various prisons in their 
own gulags,they're having riots. They're having,  
I think, some Bulgaria, maybe East Germany as 
well. They got problems. So they don't want  
to deal with the Korean War anymore. It’s 
like, who cares? Forget about it. So you  
would be guaranteed that, which might be highly 
beneficial for Ukraine. But knowing Putin, he's  
an evil man. He'll probably stick around forever.
While you're starting this Cold War history. How  
close did we get to a nuclear bomb? Some people 
argue that, like, you know, there were all these  
“close miss incidents’. It like, basically 
should have happened almost in the sense of  
like, the odds. And some people say, like, it 
wasn't going…, MAD had worked, it wasn't going  
to happen, why would they risk a first strike?
Oh, it's miracle world here. I think in the Cuban  
Missile Crisis, it came down to a Soviet sub 
Captain. They had like the political commissar,  
the military commissar, I have to reread this, 
but I don't know whether you needed a vote of  
2 out of 3 to launch a nuclear weapon or whether 
one guy was senior and you have to get him to come  
along. I have to read the data. But basically, 
someone put their foot down in the Soviet sub  
not to launch a nuke. Okay, we lucked out of that 
one. And then I think under Reagan there was an  
able Archer missile test, or we were doing a war 
game or something, and the Russians looked at it  
and thought it was the real thing for a while. 
And that just scared the bejesus out of them.  
And I think it was after that that Ronald Reagan 
started moderating his rhetoric. It's like, whoa,  
you don't want to have them on the edge like 
this. This is not going to be beneficial. So  
it was quite close. The advantage in the 
Cold War is all our leaders all the way  
through Bush Sr. were all veterans of World War 
I. In one way or another they'd served, some of  
them on the battle line like Bush senior had, 
and others near enough so that they understood  
how dangerous it was. And like all the Soviet 
leaders, Brezhnev and all those people had seen  
all sorts of people be butchered. So they were 
cautious in a way I don't think Vladimir Putin is. 
Going back to the lecture if it's true 
that you can't get primary adversaries  
to be friends with each other. And if 
you want to be friends with one of them,  
you're going to make enemies of the other one. The 
world is full of people who are enemies with each  
other. Does that mean that at once America can 
only be friends with half the world? And it's got  
to be anyways with the half that this half hates.
With India and Pakistan, it was so intense because  
of partition, of so many people who died. And it 
was recent. Right. ‘47. And so you wouldn't expect  
those animosities to die down. And also there are 
new states trying to establish their legitimacy.  
So that was particularly difficult. I 
don't know that most countries in the  
world necessarily want to kill all of their 
neighbors. And then you can look at things:  
forever, Britain and France were going at it, and 
then Germany became the primary problem between  
World War I and World War II. So then Britain is 
teaming up with France, its former primary enemy,  
and that whole problem goes away. And then you 
have the generous peace after World War II. Not  
one, World War I was not a generous peace. And 
also we have the mismanaged Great Depression  
that allows fascists to rise all over the place. 
But after World War II, generosity to the Germans,  
it's over. Look at Europe. If you study European 
history, they're all trying to butcher each other  
for centuries. And then they realize, what a 
waste. Let's just trade, play by the rules. 
Should we have cut off Lend-Lease aid to 
Stalin after 1943, when it's obvious that– 
–Bad idea–
…when it's obvious that they're winning against  
the Germans? If you'd done that, then they would 
have stopped advancing as fast in Eastern Europe. 
Is that what you're thinking? No, no.
More of Europe could have been free earlier on. 
No, because you're assuming that World War II was 
not a closely run thing. I think it's a much more  
closely run thing than you think. And there's 
no. No one's sure of how it's going to turn  
out. Everyone knows if it goes longer, it's more 
of my kids who are dying. So there's no way you  
are going to cut aid to the army that's fighting 
World War II. All right, here's a concept for you.  
There's a main theater in the war. How do I know 
what the main theater is? That's where most of  
the people fighting are. That's the main front. 
Main theater. Russians fought between 2/3 and 3/4  
of the Nazi army, always. That makes the eastern 
front the main theater. So you all think, Pearl,  
that you all think that the Normandy invasion was 
a big deal. No, that is a peripheral operation.  
It is peripheral to the main theater. And if 
the Russians hadn't been doing Bagration, this  
big operation that coincides with Normandy, no way 
would we ever have gotten onto the continent. And  
that's in 1944. So cutting lend-lease aid? Insane. 
But you're eliminating the problem of fascism  
until people have forgotten what fascism meant. 
But you're left with the problem of communism. 
By that same logic, look, the main theater 
in the Pacific War was in China, where most  
of the fighting was happening. Our Lend Lease 
aid to Chiang kai Shek was 1 to 2% of what we  
were sending to Stalin. In today's dollars we send 
Stalin $1 trillion worth of aid. Just tremendous  
amounts of supplies he used to then instil 
“install” meantl a communist totalitarianism  
on Eastern Europe. If he had sent a fraction 
of that aid to Chiang Kai Shek, and help us  
with the Japanese, maybe we somewhat unclear if 
Dwarkesh says “we” or “he” here would still be  
in power. We wouldn't have to fight as much.
We couldn't get it in. It's because if you  
want to deliver Lend-Lease, this is a problem 
in World War I. It's why did Russia fall in  
World War I? Why would you ever let that 
happen? There's no way to get the aid in  
because Russia hadn't built its Murmansk Railway, 
which goes way up north. And it hasn't completed  
the Trans-Siberian Railway. It doesn't do those 
things until, Murmansk is early in 1917 and the  
Trans-Siberian’s in 1916. That's like right 
before the Tsar falls. And so couldn't aid  
Russia in World War I. It falls for lack of arms. 
And then the blockade that the Japanese did was  
really effective. So to get aid in, you need 
railways and you need ports. The Japanese had  
covered all that and they owned all the railway 
systems. So the only way we could get stuff in  
is we're flying over the hump, the Himalayas. 
Okay, so you're going to fly in aviation fuel  
plus the airplanes and then you're going to 
try to bomb Japan from China. Imagine flying  
in aviation fuel. It's like a non-starter. And I 
think the best argument you can make is, on that,  
is that rather than getting Chiang Kai Shek to 
do the Burma campaign, ‘43–44, and he was dead  
against it, is let him keep all that equipment, 
whatever you got over the hump, instead of  
sending it over to Burma, which is strategically 
irrelevant, turns out in this war, let him keep  
everything. Because when the Japanese try to do 
Ichigo, it's their biggest offense of the war.  
They're going right down through central China 
because the United States is cutting off so much  
of their maritime stuff, they want to be able to 
have railways all the way through central China. 
Anyway. Chiang Kai-shek gets wrecked in that. 
Maybe if more of the equipment had been available  
to him, maybe, maybe he would have been in better 
shape to then put on a better showing in the civil  
war. Also not look to the Chinese people as like a 
serial loser. And it's not his fault. It's because  
he's an unindustrialized country trying to deal 
with the Japanese. Whom we found very difficult  
to fight. So why wouldn't he find them difficult.
But we kept Lend-Lease going even after Berlin had  
fallen and Stalin used that aid in order to. 
Even after the first atomic bomb is dropped,  
only then does Stalin break the non aggression 
pact with Japan and invade Manchuria. So he  
basically had no moral right to Manchuria. 
It was the Chinese who had been doing all  
the fighting. And he gets Manchuria. Should 
have stopped the Lend Lease by then. Right?  
Just to make sure like Chiang Kai Shek…
I think we stopped it very rapidly at the  
end of the war. So, yeah, the British were 
appalled how rapidly the Lend Lease aid  
stopped because they desperately needed it 
because they'd been wrecked by the war. So yeah,  
we did cut it off, but I don't, you definitely 
want Nazi Germany gone and you want to keep  
support Russia until that happens.
Can I try another idea on you? 
Yeah.
So it seems like one of the big achievements  
of modernity is that we get countries to stop 
caring about history. The idea is like, look, if  
you hear people talk about the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict on both sides, they'll go back like two,  
three thousand years about who has rights. On 
the Tucker Carlson interview, Putin was talking  
about things that happened in like 500 BC. And 
then so the big achievement is just like, look,  
the past is the past. Whatever the borders 
are right now, we're going to enforce those.  
We don't care who claims to have rights to it 
because of what happened in 1700s or something. 
That is modern international law. And I don't know 
what. You'd have to be a lawyer. That's probably  
a lawyer who actually knows of when you decide 
modern international law begins. But certainly  
by the time you're getting through World Wars, 
we're in modern international law. And that's the  
problem with what Putin's, his magic he's working 
on Ukraine, is they signed multiple times at the  
breakup of the Soviet Union and then afterwards 
what Ukraine's borders were and they're violating  
all of that. Well, have fun with it, because 
the Chinese can play that game in reverse on  
Siberia and we'll see how happily that one ends. 
But I think there is a realization that these  
disputes go back forever. And it's like musical 
chairs. We're now freezing whatever chair you're  
in. That's it. And that's modern international 
law. And it turns out that those countries that  
focus on territory of ripping it off from someone 
else or… it's negative sum, you're going to fight  
over it, you're going to destroy it in the 
process, whatever. And the Europeans are a  
great example to us all of just call it a day. 
Let everybody travel, go get a rental property  
somewhere. Right. And run your businesses. 
You really don't need to own Luxembourg or  
whatever it is. What a hassle. You want to offload 
their crazy domestic problems anyway and just run  
your transactions. This is the miracle of the 
rules based order. It is the only way to have  
a compounded, rapid, compounded growth. And you 
go, well, how's it possible that China had this  
rapid growth for a while? And their dictatorship, 
how'd that work? It's because they had the growth  
when they cooperated with the international order. 
When they rejoined the family of nations. Yeah.  
That's when they, they prospered. When now Xi 
Jinping is going to do a U turn on that. Have fun. 
The real motivation for the CCP is to keep itself 
in power. It's not a democratic system. And if  
keeping yourself in power doesn't align with 
making your country rich and therefore staying  
in the international order, if that is a correct 
mental model, then like what's the pitch to Xi?  
Why should he abide by the international 
order? Because we want him to abide by the  
international order, right?. And if the idea is 
like, well, it's not going to work out for you… 
I don’t think it will work out 
for him or for the Chinese people. 
That's not a great sales pitch.
Yeah, but there are things that you just  
cannot convince other people. Another key thing 
in strategy is you can have a very worthy goal,  
but you need to look at it carefully and go, 
is it feasible? I don't think it's feasible to  
make Xi Jinping change his mind. Because he's 
of a particular background and this is what  
he believes. And he has a whole bunch of other 
Chinese people around him who believe the same  
thing. And we're going to second Cold War. It's 
going to be a long wait ‘til they change their  
mind. If you think about Gorbachev's generation, 
they decided Gorbachev said over and over again,  
we cannot live like this anymore. The realization 
is that their standard of living was lousy  
compared to the west. So clearly they needed to 
reform and do things. But that was his decision  
and his generation's decision to reassess and do 
something else. It's going to be a long wait until  
the Chinese reassess or the Russians reassess. 
So then you have to think about protecting  
yourself and working with allies, your friends.
In the first Cold War, the Sino Soviet split,  
getting China to oppose the Soviet Union was 
a big deal in terms of winning that war. Who  
plays the role that China played in 
the first Cold War against China? 
Oh, they still played. It's interesting. So Putin 
has Russia lost. The Soviet Union fractured at  
precisely the time that China's rising. So during 
the Cold War, China's really weak and Russia's  
in the dominant position. Well, I guess that's 
reversed. So Putin is dumping all his ordnance  
on Ukraine, his Cold War stockpile, and 
he is leaving Siberia open, wide open to  
Chinese predations. And I believe Siberia has 
precisely the resources that China covets on  
lands the Tsars stole. And I think there's a big 
body of water out there called Lake Baikal. It's  
20% of the world's surface fresh water. China is 
chronically short of fresh water in North China.  
Baikal is the only fix, and I think it's flat 
enough that you could pipe it around. So I don't  
think the question is when. It's not a question 
of whether the Xi-Putin bromance is going to end,  
it's when. And I assure you, the Chinese will pick 
the moment that is least convenient for Putin. 
You think they'd actually go to war 
about it, or would they just negotiate? 
Oh, I bet it'll be negotiation of just you 
get them in a corner and say, okay, buddy,  
this is what we want. This, this, this, this. 
And then he'll want some things from them and… 
Sounds like what Zhou Enlai tried 
to do to Nehru, it didn't work out. 
What do you mean? Zhou Enlai absolutely got the 
Aksai Chin Plateau. Yeah, he offered the deal to  
Nehru. Nehru wouldn't take it. It's like, okay. I 
don't think, since they both have nuclear weapons,  
I don't think that kind of play is probably the 
play to make. But as long as Putin's desperate  
for whatever, for ordnance and other things, 
Putin's getting himself into a grand old corner. 
You wrote a textbook about Chinese history. 
From 1644 onwards. In Silicon Valley,  
there's this community called Progress Studies, 
and they're very interested in why the Industrial  
Revolution happened, how to increase growth, 
what has the history of progress been like.  
And one big question is, why didn't China have 
the Industrial revolution first in 1750? That  
much higher fraction of the population, much 
higher fraction of world output during this  
period. Why didn't they have higher growth 
rates and come up with all these technologies? 
Well, there are whole books on the subject that 
I haven't read that look into this. But I would  
flip it around and go, well, the Industrial 
Revolution starts in Europe. That's the  
unusual thing. So the question isn't why China 
didn't, but why Europe did. And I have some,  
some guesses, but they're really…There are very 
thoughtful books on this subject and you can go  
find them and have fun reading them. But if you 
look at Europe, it's a peninsula and then it's  
got the Mediterranean there. And so the Europeans, 
and they've got quite a very good river system,  
the Danube and the Rhine and the Ruhr, all these 
different rivers. And so they have…have always  
been a lot of trade going on. And then it was… 
No one's ever been able to make a big empire in  
Europe stick. The Romans did quite well for quite 
a bit of time. Napoleon tries not so good. Nazis,  
not so good at all. And I guess the French tried 
on and off and it didn't succeed. So you have all  
of these competing countries. And I think a lot of 
that was essential to the Industrial Revolution of  
having, you're focusing on commerce, and you've 
got a lot of competing places. So you don't have  
one big empire that can just sit there, be fat, 
dumb and happy that you have to innovate in order  
to survive against all these other little states.
Earlier, talking about how in North Africa or  
other regions there's been a bunch of chaos 
because people are constantly... There's these  
insurgencies, there's these civil wars, there's 
these smaller wars happening all the time and that  
causes chaos. But if you look at Europe throughout 
this period, these countries are constantly at war  
with each other. And the fact that because 
of that no one big empire forms apparently  
helps explain the Industrial Revolution. 
So it seems to imply that we should see  
a bunch of growth in North Africa or something.
It's a tremendous innovation. And look at things  
long prior, like Michelangelo and things Leonardo 
da Vinci. It's just a lot of these really bright  
people. Oh, yeah, it's my guess it's related to 
all of this. And I think the Industrial Revolution  
doesn't begin in England. And the Industrial 
Revolution isn't strictly industry. Yeah, it's  
about textiles and steam engines and railroads 
and things, but it's also about institutions. One  
of the big things for the British was insurance. 
So that when you do your trading vessel and the  
whole thing sinks, you don't bankrupt all your 
investors, because you've got that boat insured.  
And then banking, banking rules. So you can't 
just rip off everybody's cash. And so Britain,  
because it's surrounded with the moat, becomes a 
banking center. Because it's unlikely in a war to  
have some alien army come and just open all the 
vaults and take everyone's money. So there are  
these institutional things. And then the British 
trading countries like the Dutch Empire want to  
have to be able to trade in peace. So they want 
people just follow laws. So it's not surprising  
the founding father of international law is a 
member of the Dutch Republic, Hugo Grotius. And  
so it's all a piece. It's this gravitation. the 
Romans are gravitating towards law and institution  
and then these competing places so no one 
controls. I think the question is why do these.  
What's special about Europe rather than 
why it should have been somewhere else? 
What's mysterious about China is not only that 
it doesn't have the Industrial Revolution first,  
but its development starts so slow. So Japan 
copies Western institutions during the Meiji  
Reformation and industrializes almost a century 
before China is able to do the same thing. And  
look, they're communists for a while. So it makes 
sense that during the Mao period or during the  
civil war that would impede development. But 
even during the Qing dynasty or something,  
it takes till 1980 for them to start 
development. That just seems awfully slow. 
Well, communism is a really lousy system. So 
they did that. In the 19th century they have all  
these peasant rebellions where they're literally 
losing tens of millions of people that are just  
devastating the country. So that's why the 19th 
century is a lost century of all of that going  
on. So it's hard. And then there's another piece 
that's hard for the Chinese. If you've been such  
a successful civilization in Asia the way they 
had been, they were the center of everything  
culturally, science, governmental institutions, 
you name the area of human achievement and the  
Chinese were at the top of it all in Asia. With 
that kind of success, it's pretty hard to reform  
yourself. And so they also fed themselves the 
Kool-aid that the Chinese never absorbed foreign  
ideas. It was always foreigners absorbed their 
ideas. And of course that's nonsense because they  
were conquered by Manchus and actually absorbed a 
lot of Manchuans’ institutions. But that's not the  
story they're telling. Whereas the Japanese are 
well aware they're absorbing Chinese institutions  
originally, Western institutions later. And so 
that isn't antithetical to who the Japanese are. 
That's interesting. The past civilizational 
greatness may be an impediment to development. 
Yeah, it's hard. Well, also because 
the way they define civilization,  
there's only one everybody else are barbarians. 
People come and kowtow to China. Okay, great. But  
this doesn't set you up to learn from others.
One of the big dichotomies you talk about is  
the difference between limited and total 
objectives. How does Bismarck illustrate  
the value of having limited objectives?
Limited and unlimited objectives? Yeah,  
Bismarck does illustrate that an 
unlimited objective is. The simplest  
way to look at it is regime change. So if I have 
an unlimited objective against you, I win the war,  
you're going to be out of power. Versus I 
win the war, and yeah, you lose a province,  
but you'll be in power. So what Bismarck does, 
he's very clever. Well, he's operating in an age  
of kings. And actually his achievements illustrate 
why you truly don't need royal families running  
the show. It's breathtakingly incompetent. So 
initially he fights the Danish War, so that's way  
up north and it's over these two provinces. And 
he wants to set his fingers on the scale of the  
more northerly province because then that'll give 
him the rights to march troops, I think through  
the more southerly one to cause problems later. 
So war number one's the Danish war. No one thinks  
too much about it. Prussia gets an extra province 
as part of Denmark. Was part of Denmark, no big  
deal. But then he fights the Austro-Prussian War 
and then what he's after is there are all these  
little Germanic states and Austria had dominated 
a bunch of them and in that war, a whole bunch of  
them as a result of that war, he collects a whole 
bunch of these other states and no one is really  
paying attention that he's actually upending 
the balance of power in Europe. They're just  
looking at it. It's limited. He's not toppling the 
Austrian government, he's not toppling the Danish  
government. And then he fights the Franco-Prussian 
War, where he takes Alsace-Lorraine, which are  
these provinces, if you look at it's like 
a salient into one country or the other. He  
takes that and the French never forgive him, 
and that leads into World War I later. But by  
the time it's over, he's overthrown the balance 
of power in Europe that all of a sudden Germany,  
Prussia, which was the weakest of five great 
powers, suddenly has a central position,  
the Germanic states, and it owns the whole thing. 
And Britain and others who'd been asleep at the  
switch like ooh. Cause they could have weighed 
in on the scale at any point in these things to  
altered outcomes, and they didn't. There's a real 
reason why. And the people who are losing out here  
are all. They're all monarchies. There's a reason 
why you don't want to have people inherit offices.  
They don't tend to be very good at it.
Actually, so World War I. I'm not sure  
how you explain World War I using limited 
and sorry, was it ultimate objectives? 
It's limited or. Well, they're different. There 
are. It's useful in warfare to think about limited  
versus unlimited objectives. So if you look 
at Ukraine today, Putin has one of the most  
unlimited kinds of objectives from Ukraine. He 
not only wants to topple the Ukrainian government,  
but he wants to eliminate Ukrainian culture. 
And if you look up genocide in the dictionary,  
genocide can mean kill everybody, but it can 
also mean destroy their culture. That also  
applies to genocide. So Putin has a very unlimited 
objective. Kyiv, on the other hand, does not have  
an unlimited objective. I mean, as much as they'd 
like Putin to go, they just, they want Russia to  
get out of Ukraine. Right. Just get out of 
Ukrainian territory, stay in Russia. That's  
their objective. So the Ukrainians are a limited 
objective. Putin has an unlimited objective. 
Yeah. In World War I, I mean, maybe other 
than like the Austro Hungarian Empire,  
there's like. Germany doesn't have a unlimited 
objective with respect to France or Russia. 
No, it doesn't.
But it still  
devolves into this. 10 million people die.
It doesn't. Although the effect on Russia  
is to overthrow the government. In fact, 
it winds up overthrowing one government  
after another. I think as that war goes on and as 
you lose a lot of people, then you start think,  
then the objectives become more unlimited. 
Whereas, like originally it was just get back  
into German territory. After a while it's no, we 
want to overthrow your government for doing this. 
On a different topic. So your name is Sarah Paine?
Yeah. 
When I go on Amazon and I find your books, they're 
not listed as Sarah Payne, they're listed under  
the author SCM Payne.
That's correct. 
Why is that?
Well, it's interesting. When I first started out,  
I just wanted my books to be read by what the 
content of the book was. I didn't want it to be  
read whether I was male or female. Just read it 
for being a book. And then when the first reviews  
came out, it was he, he, he, he, he, he, he. And 
this is by Americans doing this. And I thought,  
wow. I guess the idea, because I wasn't doing 
women's history and this was a serious topic that,  
you know, women don't do serious topics. So 
I guess I'm glad I did it. So it looks like  
I'm a Briton, right? Because Britons love all 
the initials. And then why do I have all the  
initials? It's because my dad named all – from 
his side of the family — my three older brothers,  
and there's me. And my mom felt that some names 
from her family ought to be dumped on me. And so  
since there were three older brothers anyway, 
she had a lot of extra names going around. So  
she gave them to me and I had no say in this.
When you're training these Officers in the  
U.S. Naval War College, you've done it over 
many decades. Has the quality of the people  
you're training, has it improved, decreased 
over time? What's your class been like? 
They're wonderful people. And also I don't look 
at people like linear, I just. It's a classroom,  
it has wonderful people in there. They're the 
next generation and I will do everything I can for  
every single one of them to catapult them as far 
forward as I possibly can. So that's what it is. 
Do other countries have some equivalent of 
the Naval War College where they have this  
professional cadre of historians and strategists 
who are going through the archives trying to  
figure out insights for current leaders?
Oh, not all my colleagues publish much of  
anything. So it varies. The Naval War College has 
always had a few very A-list people. And the most  
famous person by far ever to work there is Alfred 
Thayer Mahan, and he's 19th century (well, he dies  
early 20th century). But he's the guy who, when 
the United States had been doing Manifest Destiny,  
a continental, continental paradigm because we're 
expanding, taking territory all the way to the  
Pacific. And he's the guy who says, hmm, you know, 
power and position in the world really is about  
trade. And he writes these enduring books that 
have lasted to the present. So there are these  
occasional people like Alfred Thayer Mahan who are 
very special. And as for some cadre of anybody's:  
we're just professors, we teach mid level and 
senior officers. And then most of them never  
become flag-rank with the kind of leaders you're 
thinking about. So I mean, I've talked to the  
occasional flag officer, but I'm just a minion.
So you started in Soviet studies and you found  
yourself in the Soviet Union during its fall in 
‘88, ‘89. Why was that the field you started in? 
Oh. So I grew up during the height of the Cold War 
and listened to family dinnertime conversations  
all about it. And then you listened people 
describing the Russians as being totally evil.  
And I thought, well, I'll learn more about this. 
I'm curious. And then I realized, whoa, it's just  
unbelievable how cruel the Russians have been to 
each other and others. It's like they're a class  
by themselves. I don't make it up. So. And then 
the question is, why? And learning more about it. 
And then in history, you do a minor field as 
well. And I think the typical minor field for  
Russian history would be French or German. And 
I thought, “no, I want to learn about China”  
and – just curious. And then learn about China and 
then realize that Russia and China have relations.  
But then Japan always weighs in. So then I had 
to learn more about Japan. So that's where all  
of that led. And then I also thought, I don't want 
to be studying the United States. That's where I'm  
from. And I want to learn about other countries. 
Also, my presumption is my bias would be pretty  
bad about the United States or things I wouldn't 
see. I thought, I'm going to study other places  
because I don't have any family ties. I mean, I'm 
not a descendant of Russian immigrants or Chinese  
or Japanese immigrants, obviously. So these are 
places that I'm not related to. And just curious. 
What is the answer to that? You said you 
were trying to figure out why the Russians  
have been so cruel to each other through 
history and then especially, I guess,  
after the communist revolution, why is it?
I don't know the answer, but I know…I was,  
I've just recently read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. 
I should have read it years ago when it came out,  
but I didn't. So I finally read it. And if 
you read that, look at the level of cruelty.  
It's mind blowing. It isn't simply that the 
prisoners are mean to each other, or that the  
prison guards are mean to the prisoners, or 
the guards are mean to each other. All that's  
true. And it's not simply that the civilians 
outside of the Gulag are mean to everybody.  
It's family members who are mean to people who 
are in the Gulag, the neighbors are mean to  
the family members who have anyone who's in the 
Gulag. And you start looking, going, who's not  
being mean in this place? They're all being mean.
And then you look at, oh, then I haven't got the  
list of all the words. But then I was reading 
a lot of Russian stuff last winter and then  
maintaining a list of words in Russian: “sila”, it 
means strength or coercion in Russia. In English,  
strength doesn't mean coercion, it just 
means having power. Right? But in Russian,  
it also means coercion. Or detente. It comes 
from the French, which means a relaxation  
of pressure. The Russian word, what it means is 
unloading a gun. So if you look at their language,  
it's so coercive. And I think probably if you're 
living in a really dangerous piece of real estate,  
which they are, no defensible boundaries. So 
you're always fighting people. And their answer to  
surviving that is to be meaner than anybody else. 
And they just do scorched-earth. You mess with  
them, they kill everybody, and they just don't 
care. And okay, you want to. We have the modern  
world now where we can deal with each other, 
with international law, so none of that stuff is  
necessary. But the Russians have not pulled from 
that tradition. And you can read in the newspaper  
how absolutely cruel they are to their men in 
service, right? They don't allow any of them to  
retreat. They've got the execution battalions 
behind them. So any kid who turns around,  
they're immediately murdered by their compatriots. 
Who treats their own people like this?  
Russians do, but other people don't.
I mean, Solzhenitsyn talks in that  
part about that this is the direct result 
of the communist regime's policy where if  
somebody's an orphan because their parents went 
to the gulags, if you try to help the orphan,  
you must be a sympathizer for the criminals, and 
therefore you must also be sent to the Gulags.  
And so, like, you have these orphans running 
around who's like parents have been sent away. 
The orphans – a lot of them were put into 
orphanages, and then they wound up being set  
up to join the KGB in other places. So they were 
probably some of the execution battalion people,  
I don't know the details, but there's some 
of that going on. And the cruelty in Russia  
was remarked by Europeans who were traveling 
there in the, I don't know, 17th century. So  
it goes back a long time, about the level of 
cruelty. Peter the Great, back in the day,  
he tortured his son to death. Who does that? 
He didn't have a replacement son either. 
Unlike Stalin. Final question. This new 
project you're doing on the Cold War,  
is it going to be a book? How will it come out?
Slowly. Oh, I've been working on it for years.  
It'll be a culmination of previous research. 
Starts in 1917. It will end in 1991ish. Why 1917?:  
We may not have noticed that these crazy 
communists in Russia were serious, but they  
did declare war on the capitalist order. It is 
really clear. The documentation is just there.  
And they were trying to fund people to overthrow 
governments in Europe, all around the world,  
immediately. This is in the teens, and then 
certainly in the 20s. So just because they weren't  
remotely powerful enough to do it, but they were 
like, what is it? A Maoist phase-one insurgency  
where people aren't paying attention. They're, 
like, below the radar. They're doing stuff. 
And it's going to be looking at all the strategies 
that the Russians played, that we played,  
what medium powers played and what worked and 
what didn't. And it's going to be organized around  
concepts to understand these things. So on the one 
level, if I can do it right, it'll be a history of  
the Cold War from one year to another year. So 
there's that, and then there's another one about  
strategy. Okay. People are trying to achieve 
objectives, and they're trying different things  
and integrating different elements of national 
power. So it'll be that. And then what I found  
helpful in my own career are these concepts like 
limited and unlimited war or primary adversary,  
primary theater or frozen conflict, or veto 
player. I find these things helpful. And so  
I'm going to put as many of those things in 
there as possible. And I'm of a certain age,  
so it's passing the baton to the next generation. 
Say this is what I've managed to figure out as I  
go putt-putt-putt reading in archives, and 
then others can skim it and see if there's  
anything worthwhile. If not – I tried, right?
I hope you'll come back on the podcast once  
the book is ready.
Thank you.
