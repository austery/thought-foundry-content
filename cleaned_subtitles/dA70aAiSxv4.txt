LA in a lot of ways is is sort of you you could describe it as like it's the ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar archetypal American city. Here's the larger significance of Once Upon a Time in Hollywood or my view of it, which is it captures a time and place that was absolutely critical to the evolution of modern America.
>> The reaction from the audience is extreme laughter. You are laughing during the most violent sequence for 20 minutes.
>> Well, uh excited to have the Modern the Situation crew back for another episode on movies. Uh Mark, thanks for joining again. Yes. Excited.
>> So, we want to go deeper into some of our in some of our favorite movies. Mark, I know from watching movies with you that one of your genres you enjoy is movies about Hollywood. And so, we wanted to start with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Why don't you talk about what's so remarkable about that or why you wanted to talk about it?
>> The reason I movies about Hollywood, I mean, one is they tend to be very entertaining because of course the people who make movies about Hollywood are from Hollywood and they they know where all the bodies are buried. Um, and they tend to put them all in in the movies. Um, and so they're, you know, all run spectacular Hollywood movies. So for people who haven't seen, I would recommend Mahal and Drive. Um, it's one of Eric's favorites. Um, and
>> nightmares run it
>> and, uh, and then The Player, um, which also is an alltime alltime one there. You know, there's there's a bunch of, of course, you know, famous ones like Sunset Boulevard, but, you know, the the iconic, you know, clearly the the the iconic Hollywood movie, you know, now is is Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, you know, by by Quentyn Tarantino. Um, and so, uh, the the reason I like Hollywood movies is because like, you know, there are a handful of cities that have a claim to be like the ultimate American city. Um, and you know, New York City is one of those. You know, I think you know, San Francisco in some ways, you know, where we are is. Uh, but LA and Las Vegas also put on the list. But, by the way, for Las Vegas, see Bugsy talk about that another time. But, um, that's the iconic Vegas movie. Um but uh LA in a lot of ways is is sort of you you could describe it as like it's the ar archetypal American city and and literally it's a um there's a great book we can we'll put put in the notes called thinking big where it goes actually the creation of the city of Los Angeles and basically like Los Angeles you could argue is the ultimate air American city because it was the ultimate fake it until you make it uh thing like it was the theos of cities um and so and and and very specifically like it was desert like there was absolutely nothing uh in LA And then um you know literally it was like a land development deal by a bunch of wealthy families in the in the in the late 1800s. And they they literally placed newspaper ads in eastern newspapers. You know this is you know this is before you know photography made it into newspapers. And so like you know when there was like a a picture of something in newspaper it' be a drawing. Um, and so they they would uh they would uh they would they would list land plots for sale in Los Angeles and they would have like line drawings of like you know orchards and like you know beautiful everything's green and palm trees and then you know people would like buy the land move across country and discover that it was just like blasted out desert um and then you know they they famously created you know they created the city they carved it carved it out of the desert and um and then you know they they famously um you know it's a famous saga of how they went to get the water you know which which turned into you know another great another great LA movie uh you know um uh Chinatown. Um, and you know, it as as you'd expect, you know, Hollywood kind of goes for the, you know, kind of goes for a certain interpretation of history. And so it, you know, sort of painted in retrospect as like a purely evil activity, but um, you know, there's actually, you know, there's actually like a very kind of straightforward reading, which is like this is what was actually required to create a city. Um, and it was it wasn't as black and white as as as sort of a you know, the Hollywood history has it. It was more complex story, but still, you know, very very interesting, amazing story. And, you know, cities like what Los Angeles are created every day. So, you know, that's a pretty big deal. Um, so anyway, like movies about LA, I think it when when they're when they're when when they reach the level of capital A art, you know, they they become movies about America. Um, and so it's like a great, you know, it's like a great test bed um or a great subject, you know, or a great lens through which to look at look at, you know, the history of America. And Once Upon a Time in Hollywood is, I would say, one one of the top movies u in that along that theme. Um, let me start by saying if if anybody watching this hasn't seen Once Upon Time in Hollywood, pause the podcast immediately. Um, go watch the movie
>> and then come back because I would just we going to spoil the on it. Um, and it's tremendously fun to watch if you haven't if you haven't if you haven't read about it. By the way, I'd also say like it's a tremendously entertaining movie. Like it's one of the most entertaining Ponfor Pond movies. You know, it's like infinitely rewatchable. You know, the the cast is ridiculous. Um, you know, every frame of the thing is amazing. Um so it's also a very fun movie but um so okay so here here's the larger significance of once upon a time time at Hollywood or my view of it which is um it it it captures a time and place um that was absolutely critical to the evolution of modern America um in um and I think Katherine you'll remind me but I think of the year was it 60 was it 69
>> 69 yeah
>> 69 yeah 69 and so to to put this in context and the movie you know kind of goes through this but it the movie doesn't explain all the cultural backstory it shows you what happened but it does explain the backtory so I'll just go through the back story. So, you know, basically like what we now consider to be the kind of the cultural revolution of the 1960s, you know, really started, you know, probably in like around 1964 with the Berkeley free speech movement and then kind of, you know, sort of, you know, kind of expanded or metastasized to include, you know, the the sort of hippie movements and then, you know, the sort of birth of like modern rock and roll and the rise of the counterculture. Um, and you know, all of a sudden everybody's, you know, has long hair and they've got beads and they're, you know, they're wearing, you know, suede, uh, you know, jackets and they're, you know, wearing they're not washing their Levis's. Um, and you know, sort of the whole counterculture. And so there was this like just like incredible explosion of um, you know, this when the baby boomers were, you know, you know, coming of age as as as basically high school and college kids. this incredible explosion of art, uh, culture, creativity, uh, social innovation, you know, the the birth of, you know, the commutes, you know, the the, you know, the the entire hippie movement. And then, of course, this is also when world when the Vietnam war was ramping up. And so this was, you know, the the ramp up in um, you know, in uh, in conscription of uh, you know, people, you know, American kids being sent off to to to Vietnam, but you know, kind of, you know, say non-volunteers. And so, you know, the kind of anti-war movement kicked in, the campus, the college protest kicked in. Um, and like the entire thing was like, you know, and we kind of remember it as like this like incredibly like sort of spontaneous and, you know, largely positive explosion of kind of, you know, breaking out of the staltified cultural norms of the 1940s, 1950s, you know, the creation of kind of the modern kind of liberated American society. By the way, obviously also right alongside that, you know, the civil rights movement and the feminism, the gay rights and, you know, kind of all, you know, kind of the the whole explosion of of of sort of modern modern morality through that period. Um and anyway from from like if you read the histories of the time basically from ' 64 to 69 it was just basically this like just glorious wonderful thing with like absolutely no downside like you know these kids that were like rioting on their college campuses or protesting in the streets or like you know getting stoned all day or you know having their whole hippie thing or moving to communes and going back to the earth like they had they had discovered a far superior way to live, right? They they had discovered a far superior way to like coexist with nature and to be like to fight against the man and to fight against you know evil corporations and you know you know fight for the environment to fight for the planet fight for peace and the whole thing and so it was this it was this like incredible kind of wave of of positivity and look you know the a very good argument that there was a lot too you know a lot a lot of people do believe that and then um you know and then look it was like a time of great cultural creativity that you know led to enormous amounts of like amazing art that we still have today um and so that you know there there's a lot to like about it and then And then basically what happened is in 1969 is it sort of came that the sort of positivity came to a screeching halt. Um and sort of the movement you know basically like you know turned um you know very much the dark side and you know that sort of began the long slide into the sort of 1970s. Um and that that slide was basically a slide into you know variously among other things you know it was a slide into like you know drugs you know going you know very bad drug overdoses you know the shift from sort of soft drugs to hard drugs um you know a lot of people who participated in the the the sort of this cult sort of cultural movement 60s ended up like dying. Well, we'll talk we'll talk about the death later on because you know the movie directly directly hits that but like there's just an extraordinary amount of death that followed you know degradation and that you know it it uh you know turned into you know the sexual liberation it turns out has dark sides and you know maybe it isn't so great for everybody and specifically maybe it isn't so great for women uh you know it's like at least in some ways um and then you know and then look you know in the 70s it was like you know Vietnam went very bad and then the energy crisis and economic recession and then inflation and you know just you know this very kind of you know bitter divisive of, you know, politics. Um, you know, in a lot of ways, you know, the sort of the the beginning of the political kind of dynamic that we see playing out today. And so, so, so the 70s kind of things went really bad. And then, and then, you know, you know, the book ending movie, uh, uh, Once Upon a Time is the movie sort of about that pivot point. I'll talk about that. And then, you know, Boogie Knights is maybe the movie on the other side of that, right? Which is like, you know, once the culture is kind of sliding down a hill into chaos and madness and disease of death, you know, you know, kind of Boogie Nights captures that on the other side. But for the purpose of today's discussion, we can focus on on on 1969. And so if you read the history of the time, basically what happened was it was the Charles Manson murders uh specifically in Los Angeles. And then sort of on behalf of America, it was the Manson murders that basically were the turning point. It's the Manson murders are the thing that people point to and they kind of say, "Oh, that was the moment when we all kind of realized, oh uh like there's a dark side of this whole thing and like, oh my god, here we go." Um and so and and so let's talk about that at length. Um, let me just uh close off this this intro introductory part though with kind of the most amazing thing about the movie that I found which is you know if you know the history of that period you know about the I mean the Mansa murders were super famous at the time. You know there you know they're still famous in American culture kind of everybody knows that there was this guy Charles Mansion that had this death cult. He was able to get these kids to like go out and kill random people. Um and you know there's still like all these you know questions like how the hell did he did he do that? Um, right. And so, uh, everybody knows that he was kind of intertwined with Hollywood and intertwined with the the the movie industry and the music industry and and like he he was part of that whole thing. Um, and so, uh, you know, everybody kind kind of kind of knows that, but I think that what is, um, oh, and then specifically for for people who know anything about that, they're sort of famously the Manson murders are also known as the Sharon Tate murders. Uh because there was this like incredibly, you know, vivaceious, attractive, bubbly, you know, enthusiastic young blonde actress named Sharon Tate. Um who at the time famously was was actually married to Roman Palansky who was, you know, one of the leading, you know, kind of new, you know, Hollywood movie directors of that time. They were this basically this this new Hollywood glamour power couple. Um and then Sharon Tate and among other people, you know, Sharon Tate was was one of the people murdered. So Quentyn Tarantino comes out, you know, when he first announces the movie, he comes out and he says, you know, Quentino Quinton Tarantino is going to make the movie about the Charles Manson murders, right? And if you've seen, you know, any other Tarantino movie like Pulp Fiction, for example, you're just like, "Oh my god, you know, this is going to be a like this is going to be horrible." like like like the Mansa murders are bad enough, but like you know turning them into like a you know Tarantino style you know mass slaughter violence you know reservoir dogs you know just like blood and guts you know uh exploit you know basically super high exploitation movie as he had done in the past u just like it was a horror show and I was actually I was actually personally worried about it cuz my my wife got all excited to to to see the movie uh cuz you know she you know because it's going to star Leo the Cabrio and Brett Kit and it's going to be about Hollywood and it's about fashion and you know all this you know design and all this creativity and she's like, "We got to go see this movie." And I'm like, I'm like, "We can't go see the movie because you are going to be so traumatized by what he puts on screen, but like you're never going to want to ever see a movie ever again. And you're going to hold it against me for the rest of my life, but it didn't prevent you from seeing this movie cuz it's obviously just going to be a complete horror show. Like, it's just going to be a disaster." And actually Sharon Tate's family actually came out and and basically said when this movie is first announced, basically said like, "Wait a minute, hold on." And like you know we don't want the memory of our you know of our you know of our of our family member you know who you know we we still love you know many decades later you know kind of you know turned into basically fodder for you know basically Hollywood exploitation. Um, and then there was this like amazing thing that happened and nobody knew anything about the movie which is uh Tarotino at least the way story is recorded Tarotino actually let I think it was Sharon Tate's it was either sister and maybe sister or something like that read read the script uh and immediately um the family did a 180 um and they came right out and they said we completely approved that he's paying him and I remember at the time reading that and I was like what the hell like
>> how how is it that he could possibly get the that that the tape family of all people on with putting this on screen. And of course, you know, that that that leads to kind of that, you know, the movie sort of turn turns into a valentine a valentine to Hollywood and to America and specifically to Sharon Tate. Um, you know, it's like it's like, you know, it it really, you know, kind of restores her memory in in an amazing way. Yeah.
>> He did something very smart in the movie for those of us who who love Tarantino and follow his work. So, I think there that was like the common theme was like, "Oh god, this is going to be horrific." Right? And especially if you've read about if you know the Manson murders, if you've read about how gruesome they are, like yes, that was sort of the the dominant theme. But his, you know, he he had he made a few films between, but like I'd say the last other fantastic Tarantino film was the revenge fantasy and Glorious Bastards, which is of course, you know, again, like could have been it is extremely gruesome, but at the same time, it's a revenge fantasy of what could have happened. What could have happened if someone had killed Hitler? And so in the very beginning of the movie, there's a scene with Leonardo DiCaprio also at the end, but there's a scene in the very beginning where it shows all of his films and he has the famous flamethrower from Englorious Bastards. And so if you're a Tarantino fan, you're like, "Wait, wait, wait. Which direction are we going in? Are we going in gruesome violence with no purpose, which I would argue Tarantino is always misunderstood in that way, or are we going in a are we going in a different direction, a little more fantastical, a little more what could have happened? Um, and so for those of us with like the eagle eye in the theater, I think uh I think we kind of we kind of knew, you know, especially as you said, like the family said, "Oh, it's it's great. It's going to be fine." We kind of knew, okay, this this film is not going to be nearly as bad. Um, and Tarantino is going to take us in a in a different direction, but he did put that little Easter egg in there for us in like the first 10 minutes of the film.
>> So, it's funny you bring that up because I of course totally missed that when I was watching the movie. Um, I just thought it was like it was like a re, you know, he So, so for people who haven't seen it, Leo Caprio plays a sort of a Steven McQueen style movie star on 1960s named Rick is kind of as the movie starts, his kind of career is imploding. Um, he's trying to figure out how to kind of turn things around or stay relevant to the times and it it does it shows these clips from his his prior movies in the universe. Um, and what but I just figured it was just like a throwaway. Oh yeah, I see with the flamethrower. That's funny. Haha. Um, like it didn't even for a minute occur to me. I mean, you know, just since we're going to spoil it, we'll just say the flamethrower plays a critical role.
>> A very critical role.
>> Have you ever been happier to see the flamethrower get taken out um than at the at the end of that movie? But yeah, I mean I I just I was like literally I I enjoyed the movie so much when I was watching it, but I I did not know. I mean, I I knew it had to be something amazing that I wasn't expecting in order to get the Tate family on board, but like I I I still was I I still was like sitting there in a state of dread throughout the entire movie, you know, still anticipating that he would somehow Anyway, so to spoil the movie, he he once upon a time in Hollywood, he he basically he basically tells you the story of the man called of Hollywood at that time and sort of how that all intertwined and he takes it all the way up to the night of the murders, but then he he takes a left turn um in the history as he does this alternative history. And so it and and so the the the kid the Manson cultists who who in real life culture take in the movie they they they go they go they go in the the house next door which is which which is Leo's house um with with and with Leo's friend Brad Pitt uh and Brad Pitt's character by the way I don't know you I don't know if you know this Kevin I'm curious if you know the backstory on the Brad Pitt character is it he doesn't quite say this in the movie but it explains a lot which is basically Tarantino's conception of him is he's basically the most deadly man in the world at that time. So he's he's like a you know he plays not just a war hero but like a greed beret like you know super highly decorated you know basically super soldier uh who's who's become a Hollywood stunt man. Um and so basically the um you know the the mansion killer is basically walked exactly to the wrong house because number one they're up against this guy who basically like you know spent the preceding whatever you know 20 years you know killing people for America. Um you know basically Captain America and then and then number two it turns out Leo still had the flamethrower in his garage. Um,
>> well, there's also there's also the backstory that you're you're not totally sure how good Cliff is. Like there's a whole backstory of did he kill his wife. Um, which is actually in the film and also in sort of the backstory, but like there he he is he is he is, you know, a deadly, as you said, like a very deadly person. Um, but that final scene, um, and yeah, there's no way you can anticipate, like even if you knew, okay, maybe it's not going to be as gruesome or there's going to be some sort of like revenge fantasy, there's no way you can anticipate how genius like the run-up to it is. And then also the final scene because there's this whole other thing that happens in the movie where you forget that you're watching a movie about the Mansims. like you forget that you're watching this this horrific like what what it's supposed to be and there's a there's like a 30 minute scene um of Rick Dalton who's the who's sort of this you know um aging like he's losing his place in Hollywood he sort of you know is is is sort of a at a at a loss for why he's no longer powerful right like and and and he has this moment where he stars in this like kind of cheesy western with this like 11-year-old girl and it's like a movie within a movie and And it is like probably the best encapsulation of like what happens to actors in Hollywood. So you kind of lose track of the fact it's like here's Sher Sharon Tate and she's at the Playboy Mansion. She's dancing. She's this new generation but here's this old generation of like hyper masculine figures who can't get work. And there's there it's just a genius movie within a movie where the little girl says to him and it's probably like one of the most memorable lines. She's like that's the best acting I've ever seen in my whole life. And I mean it's like just even if they'd stopped the movie there, it would have been just as brilliant, right? But then it goes on to this other sequence where you're like, "Oh yeah, we're watching we're about to see the most gruesome, you know, possible like this. I mean, and you know, I wasn't alive in 1969, but I can imagine it's like if you know, if Jennifer Lauren, if it happened to Jennifer Lawrence or if it happened to Margot Roby or Robbie, who's actually playing her, right? It would just be this horrific thing. Um, but you kind of forget because there's all of these just beautiful, hilarious sequences that run up to it. You forget that you're watching a movie that's supposed to end in this horrific violence. Um, and of course, I'll let you continue, Mark, but it doesn't. It ends it ends in a different type of horrific violence, but not female on female violence that characterized the the Manson murders, which I think is is another kind of subtext of of the of the film. Um, it's just how how gory and violent the actual episode is, but you you don't actually see that. So, I'll let you continue, but there whole other part of the Hollywood story that's really fascinating.
>> Yeah. No, that's that's exactly right. And by the way, pop quiz, Katherine, the the the little girl the the little girl actress, uh, who who was she in who was that intended to be in real life? I
>> I I don't know, actually. Um,
>> Jodyie Foster.
>> Oh. Oh, is that Oh, that's who she's supposed to be.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I didn't realize. Okay.
>> She's not under that name, but that's basically the character is supposed to be Jody Foster.
>> That makes sense.
>> And so, and I bring that up because like representative of of new Hollywood. So, so cuz so Jodie Foster was in that in that era was like a rising biscuit child star. Uh and then she she had her breakup role in I think in um in Taxi Driver um you know where she's just like you know it's like incredibly revoly you know acting performance uh uh and so she's sort of representative of the new of the new of the quote unquote new Hollywood um with the much more naturalistic like the actually naturalistic acting style that took over from the much more stylized style of the 50s and 60s. And so, so I bring that up because to to your point, part of the story there is Rick Dalton, you know, basically trying to get out of basically making clichéed haty genre stuff, right, where he just plays the same tough guy over and over again. Well, so so the running joke up until that point is that Rick Dalton starts started out his career as like a tough guy movie star. Um, and then basically, you know, over the years like that that that archetype was kind of fading in 1969. And so he was increasingly being uh being cast as the bad guy. Um and then and you know then the thing is you know the bad guy you know gets like punch is not the guy who punches and knocks other people out. He's the guy who gets punched and knocked out and he's sort of on this dumber slide and he has absolutely no idea how to adapt itself to this new world. In fact, and again, and the way the movie the way this intersects with the other the other part of the movie is, you know, uh is literally when Roman Palansky and share a tape move in next door, you know, to his character and he and literally he's like, "Oh my god, if I could just figure out a way to like get invited over for like a barbecue or something where I could just meet Roman Pansky, who's like the, you know, the the leading kind of new Hollywood movie director of that time. If I could just get captioned one of his movies, then I could stay relevant, you know, for the next decade." And he just had like absolutely there was just absolutely no reason for like Roman philosopher Sher tape to give to give this Rick Dalton character you know the time of day because he just he represent the past they represent the future um until of course at the very end of the movie you know Rick Dalton saves you know saves her life um and then in that she you know that's that's the significance of of him being invited over at the end of the movie is is sort of his entree into Hollywood having basically been taught by Jodie Foster as an 11-year-old in actually how to act right basically it comes together in it's in such a genius way. Anyway, yeah. So, so so basically like the the the sort of macro the macro relevance of this just to kind of restate the thesis is you know like if the Manson murders were were kind of where the cultural revolution of the 1960s went bad then once upon a time in Hollywood is sort of the it's sort of the fantasy or the love letter to a different America in which that didn't happen right and and and and basically things kept going in like a much more much a much more positive direction. Um, but by putting on screen the alternate direction, my view is like he really highlights how bad it was that that's not what happened. And so that the tragedy of the Manson murders was not just the tragedy for the people who were killed and for their families. U and which is a profound tragedy, but the tragedy was like for basically for all of LA cuz like LA, if you talk to people who were who were around during that period, like things got dark in LA like very quickly. Like people people were so freaked out by the Manson murders like they didn't know how many other serial killers were running around. They didn't know how many other cults there were. They like everybody all of a sudden had to like lock their doors. Like people stopped going out. Like it became like and and by the way this was the beginning of the heyday of the serial killer, you know, with Ted Bundy and you know like it was the beginning of this like wave of these things where people got like really really seriously freaked out. Um and and so that was the other but but then just generally in America that you know as I said like that was the beginning of the downward slide in the 70s. And so by by making the what if and positive kind of you know all you know counterfactual so clear it sort to me it sort of highlights and illustrates in in maybe the way that nothing else has been able to do kind of the darkness that actually played out in real life.
>> Totally.
>> Totally. And and and like I I went back and watched uh the beginning of the sequence because it's actually a long sequence of violence. Um but what I remember so much I read the reviews before not know you know they they try to not have spoiler alerts and critics were very divided. It was like this is so violent. This is extremely violent. And what what's funny about seeing it in the theater um which was I'm so glad I saw in the theater is that the reaction from the audience and these are again it's like if you've been opening weekend these are people who like really wanted to see this movie or are Tarantino fans is extreme laughter.
>> Yes.
>> As it is you are laughing during the most violent sequence for 20 minutes. And what's what's really funny about what's happening on screen too is that Cliff Cliff who's the you know the stuntman um that and again this is a spoiler like turn this off. I'm going to go into detail the he takes an edible like or LSD I can't remember if it's an edible or
>> smokes smokes an LSD cigarette.
>> Yes. So so right before so he is like high as a kite when these guys come in which is also like a funny part of it. And then and the other part that you have to like Tarantino is so particular about details and so the music that is playing when they come in is actually this like uh psychedelic rock band like and and he shows the kind of transition of the ' 60s through music through the entire thing which is really important but that scene he's listening to um uh the Supremes set me free why don't you babe right like so it's this perfect moment of like set me free and these guys come in he's high and he's like is this is this real? But but Cliff Cliff's response is like laughter. He's laughing at these women, right? And these women, you know, they have their their knives like they they are ready to to do to do the deed, you know, and um and and he's laughing. And I think it's in some ways it's, you know, Tarantino always has sort of these like takes on like masculine violence and and you know, can can you kind of can you can you can take the power out of whatever situation happened in history by just like this extreme violence and like you know it's about to happen and there's like a I won't ruin the pit bull part, but like there is something
>> let's ruin it. Let's ruin it. We're running.
>> No. Okay. Like he he sixs his pit bull on on these women, right? But it but the what watching it again, you're like this is it's fascinating because if if the Manson had been met with laughter, right? Like instead they were met with these are the most evil. They're they're you know they're they're they're taken by the devil, right? Like they were met with fear and and to Mark's point, like that set off serial killers. Like it gave power to this extraordinary evil for for decades. And I think the point of it is like what if Cliff, the most masculine deadly man in the room, had just been high and laughed and like, you know, sick as pitull on on on these on these women who, you know, are kind of silly and high themselves. And like the whole thing had become a comedy, which it turns into like 20 minutes of just sheer hilarity. Like just absolute hilarity, even though it's the most violent thing you've probably seen in the last several years. He he he the Bradford character beats a Himei to death with a telephone and it's just the funniest thing you've ever
>> It's like it's it's Yeah. It's like a And the flamethrower shows up, right? Like I mean it's it is there you could not conceive of the type of violence. It it meets it meets the most horrific violence that we know is coming, right? And like that's the backstory to this too is like you know what really happened. So you have this weird anthropolic response of you know what actually happened and it's so tragic. uh and it was women on you know I always think it's interesting that it was like the Manson family right they called themselves family it was a perversion of the family and they actually killed a woman who was 8 months pregnant starting a family so it's like this horrific all that's a hor narrative to this but like the fact that it's met with even more extreme violence and and at the time it was during you know it was during me too as well so it was violence against women but of course everyone wants that violence to happen because you don't want the alternative to happen. So, it it's this very strange um moviegoing experience u that is both delightful but also like you know a lot of mixed emotions that I think you know probably that's why I think critics were so divided on it. Um I loved it but that's why I think critics were divided on it.
>> Yeah. And then if you if you kind of telescope up you know one one notch it's it's caffing your point. It's like it's like the ultimate square in the form of Rick Dalton who's like, you know, still putting bro cream in his hair and trying to be like, you know, kind of James Dean tough guy, you know, you know, when that's not what the world wants. Um, and then, yeah, and then, you know, basically, like I said, you know, Captain America, like an icon of the American military, you know, at the time, you know, by the way, the time of Vietnam in which, you know, the military was, you know, not was, you know, it was not viewed at the level of respect that that American culture has for it today. you know, the the fact that those two, you know, end up basically beating and and roasting a bunch of hippies to death at the height of the counterculture. It's an incredibly crowd-pleasing movie and that, as you said, it kind of happened in sort of the sort of, you know, very very close to peak woke um kind of during our cultural revolution of the last decade. like it it's it's I I I don't know if you I don't know if it's properly characterized as like a reactionary movie, but it it it it's definitely not it was definitely not the arc the moral arc of of of other attempts at arc during that time period.
>> Totally. Totally. And and and just even the the final scene of as you said him getting invited over and her sort of being blissfully unaware this happens. I mean that's all magical of like she had no idea that someone this happens. Um, and you see like the camera sort of pan up and it's like this is like it it just genuinely feels like this is, you know, in the same way that Glorious Bastards was a revenge drama of what could have possibly happened, this is also like the Once Upon a Time in America story, like what could have happened. Um, and and it was a weird movie going experience in 2019 to be surrounded by people who were laughing, who loved it. you know, it it it kind of went against everything you were reading in the news, which is that like, you know, no, no one agrees with with sort of this this alternative history. I mean, it was it's just a brilliant film. Um that that Yeah, I'm excited. There's a sequel coming, right, Mark?
>> There is indeed. There is a there's a deed, which is going to be Let me also say, number one, there's a sequel coming, which, you know, is going to be just incredible, I'm sure. Uh but also, um there was a there Tarantino, it's so funny. So, you guys may both remember this, but back before the internet and even back before like DVDs and video rentals, if if you like if you if you didn't see a movie when it was in the theater, like you didn't see it. And like it might show up on TV like two years later, but if they would have cut all the good parts out, then they would have, you know, stuck in all the commercials. Um, and so you like basically in one shot to see movie in the theater and then if you wanted to see it again and it was out of theater, you couldn't. And so there was this there was this genre of paperback novelizations um of of movies. And so what you would do is you would buy the paperback novelization and then you could read that as many times as you want. So you know my I had a shot these things when I was a kid you know Star Wars and all these things you read them all like 14 times. Um, and so anyway, so Tarantino being, you know, sort of a child of this era, you know, like I am, um, Tarantino actually wrote a paperback novelization of the movie Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. And he specifically wrote it as a paperback novelization. Uh, and so it came out in paperback. Um, uh, and, you know, very much as an homage to this, but of course being Tarantino, it's it actually turns out, of course, it's not just a paperback novelization. It turns out it's like an entirely new novel. Um, and so and and it's actually funny because it doesn't it's it's it's it's it's it's the novel is set in the same world of the movie and has and and and goes much deeper into the themes of the movie, but like he doesn't even get he doesn't care at all about like having the plot of the movie actually in the novel and so he just throws it away right up front in the novel. Oh yeah. Yeah. And then Rick D Rick Dalton like roasted a bunch of hippies, you know, in his swimming pool that night, right? So like it's like the plot's not the point for for the novelization. So the the novelization I think I think as a as a very few people have read it you know kind of just by by virtue of how he how he came out with it I think because I think people didn't know what to make of like literally a paperback novelization in like 2022 or whatever it came out. Uh but I think it has he does a reasonable claim on being a great American novel. Um because and the reason specifically uh Keith I think you enjoyed it a lot because it it just it goes much deeper into all the themes of you know that we're talking about. And so it like it goes really deep into the transformation of Hollywood that was happening at that time. you know, it goes really deep into the making, you know, this the western show that happens inside the movie, which is actually a real show called Lancer. Uh, it was actually a real show with with that, you know, with that setup and with those actors. Um, and it goes much deeper into into all the characters and it goes deeper into the Manson family. Uh, and so it's um, uh, yeah, it's really amazing. And by the way, I should also say, um, uh, yeah, the the movie does have a scene in which it is left ambiguous as to whether or not Cliff Booth killed his wife. Uh, by the way, let me just say the wife played by Rebecca Dehart, um, who just like I think she's in the movie for like 30 seconds and she almost steals the movie. Like she's just hysterically funny and she plays like the meanest like wife in the world. She's just like hectoring and like screaming at Brad Pitt and they're literally on a fishing boat. Brad Pitt has a spear gun in his lap. Um, and it's sort of and in the movie it's it's like set up as basically, you know, there was a spear gun accident um, you know, following this argument and and did did Brett B actually actually deliberately kill his wife or not? Um, and of course in the novelization it makes her fair. Yes, he he in fact yes, he
>> I think it's I think it's in the I think it's in the novel. I think it's like yes, Brad Pitt definitely killed his wife and got away with Cliff Booth killed his wife and got away with it. Um, and then I think that I think I think he says the novel he says and that was one of the three times that Cliff Booth committed murder and got away with it. So anyway, anyway, for those of you who've only seen the movie, it turn it turns it turns out the click poof character actually yes has a real dark side and and yes, the the hippies picked the wrong house to stumble into
>> and and so is the we were talking offline about how it's you know there's some relevance to today is is the connection that you know the 2010s to to some people was seen as a sort of glorious march towards uh you know progress and then you know whether it's the 2020 Floyd riots or more recently the Louis G you know murder or or the murder of Charlie Kirk there's kind of this moment of oh my god that this thing has gone off there is that that kind of the
>> so I would say whichever side of the political and social spectrum you're on like the world that we live in today is a much darker version of what everybody thought we were going to be living in I mean like so for people who were like 100% on board with like the social back up a second there Eric to your point so like I think there's a very direct analogy of let's call it 1964 to 1972 or something um with the re-election of Richard Nixon. Um like that cultural revolution that happened during the 60s kind of the hippie Vietnam, you know, kind of revolution. Um I I think what we what we in America been through the last decade is sort of another version of that. Like I think we we went through our version of that. It started around I would date it to like 2015 2014 and then you know it basically that era sort of ended November November November 2024. You know obviously if you're on the right you're like oh my god thank god that's over. um and you know the the world could move on. If you're on the left, of course, you're like, "Oh my god, what just happened? How did you know how did the revolution revolution go so bad?" That that is precisely what happened at the at the end of the revolution in the 1960s and and specifically I mentioned 1972. So Richard Nixon was elected president 1968 and it was like a hard fought race and very dramatic in Minnesota, right? But then he was reelected in 1972 in a landslide like I was cas 49 state landslide or some crazy thing like it was just like an overwhelming landslide. So, it's like the American people basically rose up and and basically said, "Yeah, no more of this. It's over." Um, and and so we, you know, we we I mean that the echoes are just like profound of of how this played out and, you know, and they're echoes, right? It's not exactly comparable, you know, in Iraq and Vietnam, you know, play different roles and so forth and the economy, you know, developed in different ways and, you know, Trump and Nixon are different people and so forth, but and the social movements are different uh, you know, and times have changed, but still like there there there was there was a cultural revolution. it was, you know, either glorious or terrible for some period of time and then get ended, right? It was just like a sequence of events happened where just like it was over and you're out the other side and you're in a new world. Um, and and and and and then I I would argue like that's exactly what that that's exactly the process kicked off in 69 with the Massenberers and then sort of book ended with 72 with Nix's re-election and then kind of the slide into the 1970s and then ultimately 1980s like that transformation and then I I would argue like that that's pre precisely the same kind of transition that we're going through right now. Um and I I think it's either it's either thrilling or horrifying people in a very similar way um that the that the end of the 60s either thrilled or horrifying people. Yeah, Katherine, would you agree with that?
>> I would I would. Um and I I also since you mentioned Vietnam, I I want to transition to the best Vietnam war film ever made.
>> Okay. This is this is everything we've said up until now is milk toast as compared to the extremely controversial plane that Katherine is about to make. Please go for It is it is it is by far the best Vietnam war film ever made. Um and of course it incorporates every Vietnam war film ever ever made in including Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket. Um you know once or or um Born on the Fourth of July, Apocalypse Now. The best Vietnam war film ever made is Tropic Thunder. Uh but it also happens to be one of the best films about Hollywood. Um, actually our I would actually say that Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, while it is an incredible film, is more about America, but Tropic Thunder is also about America in different ways and reveals a lot about America, but is is by far the best Hollywood film ever made. I'll let Mark talk about why that is. Um,
>> well, let's tell us dated. Traffic Thunder was what year?
>> It was 2008, which is actually very important. Um because I think one of the things that people forget is that um 2008 was also the year where we had a a P from the Vietnam War running for office against the first black president in history. And that is in very important context for all of the themes dealt with inside of Tropic Thunder, which of course is a comedy. Um it's a satire, but it satarizes everything in the kind of Before Times 2008. Um, but I think that is a very important subtext to what came out during an election year where those two themes were on display. Um, but I'll let Mark get into the summary. Um, since it's also one of his favorite films.
>> Well, it it is although I I I'm going to defer so because you know I think it's I think it's historically fun. You know, it's maybe the funniest movie funniest Hollywood movie the last 25 years or something like. It's just it's just like an incredibly entertaining movie. Um, and just for people to just have a sense of like how much times have changed, like the most I mean there's many amazing things about it, but one of the most amazing things about it is, you know, the the great actor Robert Downey Jr. uh plays the entire movie of Blackface and not only plays the entire movie of Blackface, like I would say extraordinarily commits for the bit. Um,
>> yes, he's a method actor playing a method actor.
>> Entire movie in method playing another method actor, you know, playing an actor in in in a type of blackface. Um, again, which which to your point on on um Once Upon a Time in Hollywood when the film was first announced, this was known that that Robert Downey Jr. was was going to be playing an actor in blackface. And as you can imagine, it was the same thing that happened with Once Upon a Time in Hollywood where it was like like the, you know, in the same way that the the Tate family was terrified of what would happen in the film. Um, there was a whole kind of, you know, terror of what what is going to like Robert Downey Jr. like like like he's destroying his career like who does Ben Stiller think he is doing this movie, right? Like no one actually knew the backstory or how it would be satarizing Hollywood actors who will go through any extreme length to win an Oscar. Um but but when you get into the film it is handled so beautifully indelically and actually I was I was reading um I was reading about sort of how they handled it um when they were producing it which was that they invited you know a number of members of the NAACP. They invited, you know, a number of different like very thoughtful critics and said, "You have to see this film first and see." And it was again the same sort of thing where it's like everyone saw it first and they said, "Don't worry, it's perfect." Right? It's hilarious. Um, and so I'll let you continue, but it like they handled it in a way.
>> Did did they have to apologize in the 2010s? I remember Jimmy Kimmel had to apologize for blackface uh or or one of these people. Did they get away with it?
>> Interesting point. So they didn't So when it came out it was so clearly satarizing um white actors who were trying to win an Oscar, right? Like so it was clearly satarizing everyone. It it was not it was you know it was it was sort of universally beloved. So much so that that Robert Downey Jr. was nominated for an Oscar which is a whole other backstory to how they made that happen because it was kind of a continuation of the movie that they as a joke petitioned the Academy. you know, it said for your consideration and the Academy actually nominated him for an Oscar for the role. So, it was so it was so like beloved like what he did and how how how brilliant the role was that no one cared. But I believe it was like 2017 or 2018 when this sort of like new crop of young people came through journalism and said like this is horrible. They tried to sort of cancel him. You might know Mark better if how he handled it, but like it it clearly they did not cancel Robert Downey Jr. for doing a satarization of of the role he played.
>> So, just to just to fill this in and then we we'll get to I want to get to the Katherine your the Vietnam aspects of this, but uh Vietnam war movie aspects to this. Uh but yeah, so just specifically what happened was correct me if I have this wrong. Um Robert Downey Jr., a white American actor, plays a white Australian actor um who is a method actor who I think was sort of loosely inspired by Daniel D. Lewis as sort of a, you know, sort of that that kind that kind of sort of, you know, super elite. You know, there there's a couple scenes where you see where you see where you see Robert out of black face, but but dressed up with as uh dressed up as the u as the Australian actor who like has like I forget what's like translucent green eyes or something as this very striking striking look and like this very plumby Australian accent. Um and so it's a white American actor in real life playing a white Australia actor playing a southern black man in blackface for the entire movie. On top of that, I believe Robert Downey often often improvises uh through throughout his movies. And I I think a fair amount of the uh uh I think a fair a fair amount of the portrayal was was was him on on the spur of the moment, which is which is, you know, fairly incredible uh uh when you see it uh because he he fully fully inhabits the world. And then of course he's he's actually in the he's actually he's in, you know, in in in the movie inside the movie. He's in he's in a platoon with of course an actual black guy who's a young black actor whose name I can't recall, but he just like was impressed having this. It was such a to him. He's a br it's a brilliant like the way they play off each other is brilliant. His name in the film is Alpuccino. But Alpacino
>> Alino who's a rapper who's a rapper who becomes an actor.
>> Yes. It and and there's a
>> there's a whole other
>> Go ahead. Sorry.
>> Oh no, no. I was going to say there's a whole other through line there of his his role because I think one of the things that everyone remembers of the film is they have the fake um trailers before the film starts and he is Alpuccino the rapper and he's selling a drink that he calls Booty Sweat. Uh and and what's so funny about like how brilliant this film is because not only like not only do they satize Hollywood in the film, they were like first Barenheimimer like what they did they're like we're going to market this in so many funny ways. is they did incredible things before and after the film, but one of the things that the that they did was they made Booty Sweat into an actual drink, marketed it through the entire Oscar petition. Like they they went so far. I mean, the only film that's done this as as exceptional as Drop of Thunder was was Barbie. Um, but they they they they figured out how to turn every aspect of this film into a into marketing genius. The other smart thing that they did, by the way, the one of the actors that that Ben Stiller, Ben Stiller plays this guy named Tug Speedman, who is based on a dumb Tom Cruz. His name is Tug Speedman, right? Like, where did they get that name? It's Tom Cruz. But they also have Tom Cruz in the movie as as the producer who's based on Harvey Weinstein. Uh, less less I I can't remember.
>> What? Less Gman.
>> Less Grossman. Yes. Um, and so but they didn't want anyone to know Tom Cruz was in the film. So they actually sued anyone any of the paparazzi who took pictures of him before because they wanted people to come to the theater and not know that Tom Cruz was in it. And of course he like wrote his entire role like like he he to to your point in improv like he improvised that entire role and wrote it like it was sort of Tom Cruz's brainchild. I think they originally offered him something else and he's like, "No, no, I I want to play Harvey Weinstein." And it is genius, but they did so many things to make sure that the entire sort of cult of the movie outside of the movie was like Hollywood produced. Um, where you to to to Mark's point, you have this, you know, method actor playing a method actor who is trying to get an Oscar through his method acting who ultimately ends up getting nominated for the Oscar, losing to Heath Ledger the the year that Ledger died posthumously. um when it was awarded to him. But it it's like they they could not have this is a 20-year project. That's the other that's the other very interesting thing about this was like Ben Stiller has been working on this since the 80s. And it was just that year where they were finally able to get it made and it is this brilliant commentary on all of Hollywood. And we can get into the Vietnam stuff too because I think it's also commentary on that. But it's it's it is the best Hollywood film ever made even in the fact that they were able to successfully sway the Oscars.
>> Right. Well, it was also Catherine to your point. It was also the recite of the Tom Cruz image issues at the time cuz this was after the sort of run of controversy around him and psychology and his personal life and all those things. And there there was so this run of very bad publicity. A lot of people in the industry were worried that he was not going to be a bankable movie star anymore. And I I think this role in this movie was basically his recovery from that which which was pulled off absolutely perfectly. And of course he then went on to be an even bigger movie star than before.
>> Totally.
>> Yeah. So it's a great career resurrection in in the middle of this. Yeah. And then yeah just just in terms of like how how much times have changed or you know somebody once said that the past is a is a foreign planet or another country. Um is yeah like you you had an American actor being nominated for an Oscar for for a character performed at black blackface in 2008. directed by a Hollywood filmmaker who's obviously a genius but you know within 10 years was like he you know Ben Ben Stellar subsequently became one of the wokest Hollywood figures uh you know in in the years that follow like you know all all through the last decade like Ben Stellar has been like you know you know to to the left of Shavara on every social and political issue and so and I I you know I I don't know I've never met him I've met great admirer of his art but like I wonder how much of his shift to the far left politically and socially was a was a reaction having made this it.
>> Well, well, and the other thing is everyone focuses on Robert Downey Jr., but there are like at least four other untouchable things that happened in that film. Um, so the the disability advocates actually when the film came out, the the people who were most upset in 2008 were the disability advocates um because of the um commentary on what's I believe it's on what's eating Gilbert Grape, right? Never like I'll just say
>> oh and forest Forest and Forest Gup. Yes. Yes.
>> And Rayman and Rayman. Yeah. Um um uh uh Simple Jack.
>> Simple Jack. Yes. So the the the famous line that is said is and and again I'm I'm quoting the film, never go full Um which was okay to say in 2008 except for the disability advocates um who were who were very upset about it. And of course, like they were sort of on the fringe in 2008, but that was actually the thing that that Ben Stiller had to apologize for because they they didn't they didn't test the film on SimpleJack. But it was commentary from from Robert Downey Jr. in blackface saying everybody knows and then saying the line, right? Because because Tug Speedman doesn't play it as he should. Um he he he does the full Leo DiCaprio what what's eating Gilbert Grape sort of like, you know, full on, right? He doesn't do Rain Maker. But there's two other things that happen. Um, so the the other thing that I think people didn't realize is that be it is so much of a commentary on Vietnam War film because a lot of Vietnam war memoirs in later years have been proven to be completely disingenuous, right? So it's like people who said they went to Vietnam didn't go to Vietnam. And so in the storyline and the film, the guy whose memoir, Tropic Thunder, the movie is actually based on,
>> right,
>> is a is a member of the Coast Guard who never got sent to Vietnam who worked for the sanitation department, right? Like that's like a whole theme in the movie. And so there's this like brilliant commentary also on like, you know, veterans issues and I think some veterans groups were upset about it. There were also people who were very upset with um Tom Cruz's portrayal. Um, and it was, you know, it was before we kind of all knew who he was betraying and everything, but there were people who were very upset that they felt that that was the stereotype. So, like pretty much every character, like there was there was people who were and again these were cringes. It wasn't like mass commentary on this, but there like they managed to insult like every protected group uh in a way that like ev like everyone kind of was like, well, yeah, but it's it's satire, right? So, it it was a totally different time in America, but it wasn't just um you know, focus on on race relations. I mean, it was on, you know, we had a again, we had a Vietnam P running for president that year
>> and and basically a mockery, like the greatest mockery of Vietnam film ever made. So, in some ways, it's like this film was just like so perfectly timed for the era we were living in.
>> Well, we still have to this day, let's not names on on a on a otherwise a fun a fun podcast, but there there are sitting United States politicians in in serious offices who like literally faked Vietnam War records.
>> Like that like that's not over. like that's actually still the case. Um, and so to to your point like you know there there were many people obviously who served very honorably in Vietnam and then there were people who like made up completely fake stories and wrote them the rest of their career. Um, and like you know that Yeah. So the movie takes like it's your point movie among other things takes direct aim at that
>> and I I believe the guy wears a hook the whole film with glasses hand. I mean like there's like this movie is so brilliant. It's so brilliant and the levels of of commentary um just are are remarkable to this day.
>> Yes. Yes. And so yes. Yes. Cute. Yes. I mean just like so yeah maybe this is book ends the the previous previous conversation of just like Yes. This is clearly made before the culture before our version of the cultural revolution. Um and so it's it's it's like a it's like it's like an ancient artifact. Um uh um like I say only now are we re-emerging into a world in which a movie like that could be made like for a movie like that for the last probably what 13 years or something would have been totally off limits. Um and we're coming out into a world now where movies like that can get made again.
>> Yeah. Jimmy Kimmel is not going to bring back the man show to his uh his his roots. Um
>> for people who followed Yes. For people who don't get the reference, for anybody who followed the recent Jimmy Kimmel uh sort of affair and all of the outrage, uh it is worth going on YouTube and just yeah, looking at clips from a Jimmy Kimmel show 20 years ago, which was literally called The Man Show. Um and uh to just to get a sense of the uh the the long and twist the long and twisty road that some of our uh some of our highest most famous public figures have followed.
>> And also a tale of a tale of two comedians, right? Because it's him and and Adam Corolla, right? And it's like their their careers have detoutored dramatically since since the show.
>> Yes, that's right.
>> Two other films we wanted to discuss uh were Oenheimer and Fight Club.
>> So, let's start with let's start with let's start with Oppenheimer just because it's it's more it's it's more recent. So, I I I will make the case. So, I'm a I'm a you know enormous Christopher Nolan fan. I've seen all his movies. I love all his movies. I I think they're really tremendous. Um you know, I I think that I you know, let me say this. I'm I think Tenant is one of the best movies I've ever seen. Um, and like I I I I sat through Tenant with a giant smile on my face the entire movie. Like I just thought that was just like absolute magic. Obviously I loved Inception. Uh, I loved many of his movies. Um, and I think Oenheimer was like an incredibly well-made movie. Um, and had, you know, incredible performances and was was like, you know, put together really well. It was, you know, tremendously interesting to watch. I I I I will argue that it did not re reach our level of capital A art. Uh, I think it it actually quite badly fell short um on sort of uh I would say morality and um and uh and ultimately and and in importance uh to our culture. But uh yeah, let me I'm be happy to get my feel on that. But let me just start by saying C Katherine, would just out of the gate, would you agree with me on that or would you like to would you like to take that would you like to take the pro side that Oppenheimer was great art? No, I I I agree with you, but I probably I probably concur like I probably have different reasons um than you as to why I didn't think it worked. Like and I should I should preface it with like I I had hyped this movie so much where my expectations might have been so ridiculously high that when I finally saw it, I was like me. But I do think it's interesting Robert Downey Jr. was all he won the Academy Award finally for Oenheimer. He deserved it for Tropic Thunder. I he was fantastic in the movie, but I will say he deserved it for Tropic Thunder and if not for Heath Ledger, he would have won it for Tropic Thunder and I feel like that that would have been really the role he should have won it for, but he was fantastic in Oenheimer as well. So, to your point, like there there were there were many good uh performances. My my sort of criticism is probably different than yours, but it probably has a lot more to do with like the actual sort of storytelling and film making than the actual um content of of the of the work.
>> Okay, got it. Yeah. So I because I would say so for people who haven't seen it, we're going to spoil it. So, uh, Robert Robert Robert Downey plays, uh, a real life guy named Lewis Strauss, uh, who was a, um, he was a very high ranking like sort of important person of the of the of the 1950s, 1960s in the government. Um, and, uh, ended up I forget the exact role, but basically ended up overseeing um, uh, Oppenheimer having a security clearance stripped and and basically being booted out of the out of the military-industrial complex after after, you know, basically leading the creation of the atomic bomb. Um, and the the movie kind of goes through that whole story. Um, uh, and you know, it's a fantastic performance. All the all I mean, look, all the performances in the movie were fantastic. Uh, Jillian Murphy was just outstanding as Oppenheimer and and then was it Benny, I think it's Benny Safy, one of the Safety brothers, uh, played um, Edward Teller um, and like almost just stole the movie just with that portrayal. Um, and again, you know, a real person, the creator of the later the creator of the hydrogen bomb. Anyway, so fantastic performances, fantastic direction. Um I I will argue my my critique of the movie though it involves the following claim which is that Louiswis Strauss is actually the hero of the movie.
>> Yes. May maybe go into that history so people understand um because that is definitely not the takeaway from the film.
>> Yes. That is not what the film intent uh uh you know the film intended I think the film in see if Katherine would agree with this. The film intended to contrast basically a great man Oppenheimer to basically a u an an as an an aspirate to greatness who you know fell badly short in in the Louis Dra character who sort of brought the great man low and in a in a fun fundamentally unfair way. And then it sort of the movie sort of sets up both uh Oppenheimer and actually also specifically Albert Einstein as sort of the key moral authorities um of of the era with respect to use of nuclear weapons. Both both claims of which I believe are like deeply incorrect um on substance. Um and this is my critique of so my critique of the movie is not in it execution or any of the performances. My critique is the morality of the movie I think is very badly upside down. Um and and it's upside down in a way that kind of flatters our current politics but like is very badly upside down in terms of what actually happened at the time. Um and so the the movie basically tells the story of course Robert Oenheimer the the sort of person who ran the the Manhattan project created the atomic bomb which was then you know at least his story where he gets credit for you know helping to end World War II you know when when when the US dropped dropped you know there won't be only two uses of the atomic bomb in wartime you know to date where you know the US dropped dropped a bomb on Japan twice in 1945 and you know and there you know there's even still to this day debate about this but you know generally accepted history I think is that that you know that ended the the the Pacific theater conflict, you know, sooner than it would have. It it prevented the need for a land invasion of Japan, you know, you know, conceivably, you know, saved like a million lives or something like that. Now, by the way, it was dropping the atomic bomb on two civilian cities, right? So, again, you know, like the morality of the time was, you know, quite a bit different than, you know, than maybe ours today, but but anyway, so that's that's kind of the history of it. And then, you know, famously, the Manhattan Project was sort of this assembly of of sort of the finest minds uh in America. Many many of whom by the way were you know refugee you know uh not not up I'm up and I character actually is a is a is a in in the movie in in reality and in the movie is German Jewish whose you know had who his family had arrived much earlier um and but then a lot of the other key members of the uh Manhattan project you know kind of been one of the great twists of irony were Hungarian Jewish refugees from you know from from basically the Nazi kind of rampage through Europe you know who came to the US and and and basically you know helped arm up the US which Edward Teller was an example of that um and So anyway, so the movie tells this, you know, kind of the amazing story of of the Manhattan Project, but specifically in the arc of of Oppenheimer, um, I guess I would say that the the the the conventional, let me back up for a sec. I think the first half of the movie I think is actually quite historically grounded and I think has like I I like I at least I agreed with this interpretation of history. And so it is the following. So the first half and I think the movie is maybe a little bit schizophrenic and I should give it a little bit more credit than I than I was. But like the first half of the movie is actually a it's one of the only recreations on film of what American elite culture and society and American um uh research establishment of kind of the leading experts at the time the 1920s and 30s like how thoroughly saturated that that world was communism. Um and and specifically it sort of recreates uh you know this sort of the there's actually there's actually a joke in the movie there's a line in the movie that sort of one of these one of these jokes is not really a joke which is the joke is you know cuz the a lot of the movie takes place as is set up as at UC Berkeley um and uh there's sort of a joke a joke in the movie which is like you know well you know you know it's so and so on the Berkeley faculty you know is a communist somebody else will says yes like half the Berkeley faculty are communists like every like everybody knows that like it's just completely taken for granted and of course you know the the politics of that aside the issue becomes, okay, now they're working on a classified weapons program. Um, you know, the US is, you know, is kind of variously at odds with not just Germany, but also with Soviet Russia. Um, and, you know, there's this very big concern, you know, we're, you know, the the this effort is is is inventing this, you know, super weapon. Uh, and there was a, you know, very high degree of concern that the the secrets of of the atomic bomb were going to, you know, just walk their way out the out the door from Los Alamos. were going to end up at, you know, bad people's hands, you know, and one fear obviously was that they'd end up in Hitler's hands, but another fear was they would end up in Stalin's hands. And by the way, spoiler alert, that's exactly what happened. So So in fact, the nuclear secrets will walk right out the door. Um and um you know and and basically the both the the the concepts of the atomic bomb and then actually the specific wiring instructions uh for the atomic bomb were actually walking right out the back door of Los Alamos into into into into Soviet's hands and Stalin got the bomb very quickly after that and it was directly derived from the work that actually happened on the Manhattan project. And so it turned out the Manhattan project like it really was riddled in the contra spies and there there's these famous names in history like the Rosenbergs and David Greenlass that you can go through and read about if you want. But like it like the the fears of all of the people who are worried about this were actually correct. It is actually what happened. Um by the way there's a character in the movie Boris Pash who is sort of the security officer at the Manhattan Project both in real life and in the movie. In the movie, he's sort of portrayed as this like guy with basically essentially a stick up his butt like this like guy who's like, you know, like constantly like, you know, cross-examining and not trusting the scientists and thinks that I'm Oenheimer's probably a spy and the whole thing. He's kind of portrayed as this like over the top, you know, kind of thing. But like if you if you go if you read his Wikipedia entry of like what his life story had been up until that point, he's another one of these guys where just like he has just this incredibly impressive backstory of like service to the country at fighting commiss. Um and then you know and then like you know whether he was right about Oenheimer we could talk about but like he was right that like Los Alamos would run with cognitive spies and this is going to lead to catastrophe you know with with Stalin getting the bomb. Um and then you know the Strauss character was also very worried about that and again you know outside of whether he was right about Oppenheimer per se. He was he was right about the he was right about the broader issue. Um and so so so that is what actually that that is what actually happened. Um, and so like all of the security concerns that are kind of a setup to what you know is sort of portrayed as the persecution of Robert Oppenheimer, like they were all completely legitimate security concerns. And in fact, the worst case scenario actually did happen. Like all the secrets like walked right out the door, went straight to Stalin. The first Soviet, we now know this, the first Soviet atomic bomb was wire for wire compatible with the US Nagasaki bomb, right? So, so, so, so, so they got literally the wiring threats. And, you know, for for people who have read about nuclear weapons, like it's actually very hard to detonate a nuke and they have to be wired in a very specific way. Uh it's like you can't they're very difficult to set off and like the Soviet spies on the Manhattan project literally like transferred that information to to to to Russia B nuclear power. Um and so anyway like within that there's this arc of basically Oenheimer you know was he or was he not there's one arc actually which is was he or was he not himself a Soviet asset which is it's generally viewed historically that he wasn't literally a Soviet asset although I think there are still questions around that in fairness and we could talk about that but then there's just this broader thing which is even if he wasn't like was he trustworthy and could could he be relied upon and then there was this specific thing that actually happened which the movie presents a version of that I think is not is my understanding history is not correct but which Oppenheimer basically u worked his butt off to to deliver the atomic bomb for the purpose of beating Germany and Japan. Um but then immediately upon that happening, the US weapons program shifted into making the hydrogen bomb which was going to be the you know the big one that was going to be used ultimately you know ultimately was going to be used in the cold war you know as as a deterrent against the Soviet Union you know at a project led by Edward Teller um and um and and the accusation always was Oenheimer deliberately slow roll the development of the hydrogen bomb like he he tried to prevent that from happening of course the the the you know and you know Oppenheimer's version of the story is it's one thing to like have a nuc take out a city if to end a war it's another thing to have a nuke that could take out the planet. Uh, you know, and and and so like, you know, should we really be doing this? But there's another version of the story which is you were completely in favor of beating Germany and Japan and then but the minute it came to beating the Soviet Union, you know, you got cold feet. Hm. You know, isn't that interesting? Right? That that that that's the thing that you didn't want to have happen. And then there's just the reality that like Oppenheimer's background and political activities and like all of the people around him including his wife and his girlfriend and his brother were actual like I don't believe this to be the case. I think his wife, his girlfriend, and and his brother were all actual communists, like actual capital C carry communists. And then Alenheimer himself was like embroiled in communism and it's it's sort of communist, you know, sort of adjacent organizations, you know, his entire life. He he's not known ever have been a member of the Communist Party. Although again there's there's there's u there's ambiguity there because the Soviets had a practice of having their best placed assets actually never become members of the communist party because of course they were trying to protect them against exactly the kind of persecution that Oppenheimer got got got leveled against him. U so anyway so in in the movie ultimately his security clearance gets gets stripped and he sort of resigns to disgrace. The movie paints this as like a great act of moral heroism on his part where basically he wanted credit for the little bomb, but he didn't want the big bomb to happen and certainly didn't want to have anything to do with it. Um, you know, and and look, you know, he's dead. They're all dead. Like, you know, I I don't know that we'll ever know like what what what lay in their hearts, but there are very interesting questions around this. Um, and then there's the the and then there's my most stinging indictment of the movie, which is Einstein was the exact opposite of immoral exemplar. Uh, Einstein was a Stalinist. like Einstein was like a fullon like Einstein was proto Stalin like not even just procommunism was actually like pro Stalin and Einstein thought but like American democracy was like not going to cut it and like we clearly needed to get to communist dictatorship and there's a there's a book that goes through this called when reason goes on holiday uh that came out a few years ago that kind of goes through all of Einstein's writings and speeches and kind of reconstructs this history and so the movie kind of presents Oenheimer and Einstein as like the adults and especially Einstein as like the moral adults in the room uh to a degree that I just think is like basically at this point bizarre and the and the reason it's bizarre is because you know the whole thing is set up of like oh my god what if the atomic bomb destroys the world oh my god you know this whole thing and all politics involved in that so the beginning and so forth but like we're sitting here 80 years later and and the thing that we know today and I don't know that any of us would choose to have had the events play out this way and maybe the world would be better without the bomb or whatever but like what we know today is World War II didn't happen um and so basically like everybody everybody in sort of the military political establishment in 1945 kind of took it for granted that there was going to be World War II with the Soviet Union at some point. Um, and it was going to be a land war, you know, in Europe and around the world and it was going to kill probably, you know, on the order of 200 million people and it was just going to be absolutely devastating. And like, you know, in any other era like of of of sort of geopolitics, like that almost certainly would have happened given how given how tense everything got, especially in the ' 60s and ' 70s. Like, literally, it didn't happen. Like World War II is is is the dog that didn't bite. And and the reason World War II didn't happen is sort of, I think, fairly obvious, which was mutually assured destruction, right? that the fact that both sides had nukes basically meant that neither side could go to war with the other and that resulted in you know it resulted in a cold war but not a hot war. Um, and so I, you know, I think if you kind of stack up Oppenheimer and Teller and these guys, you kind of say, you know, by by by by building bombs that could destroy the world, they prevented at least one, you know, major world war, if if, you know, by the way, if if not many. Uh, and by the way, the existence of nukes may prevent another world war for 500 years, right? You know, we don't know yet, but like, you know, like that that mutually assured destruction is is is still in effect. They may be they may be uh they may be causing us to not have a hot war with with China, right? The fact that both the US and China have nukes. Um, and so anyway, so and and by the way, that's all debatable and you could argue that, but like that's the argument that's the argument that ought to happen like especially with what we know today. And I just thought the movie like I thought the movie just like really cheated on the morality of it because it kind of presented this as slam dunk that the nuke was bad and that these people were bad and the whole thing was bad and that Einstein was like a or sorry that both Einstein and Oenheim were moral heroes in some extent kind of trying to line up against this and I just thought that that really cheated the audience. I I I think uh I think you and I are much closer on our critique of it. My my sense is very similar to yours that it started out very strong, right? Like like your your the portrayal in Berkeley like was a very interesting, you know, like you kind of you saw this complex figure and complex character and then there's this whole middle section um on the Manhattan Project that kind of culminates in what I would say is like incredible like visuals and sound. Like actually like the movie excels in both score and sound. And if you saw it in a theater, you were like the the the sound editing is like the thing that won the Oscar, right? I think they won 10 Oscars. I mean, they won everything, but it's like like sound editing and score like just incredible movie making. And then to your to use your word, schizophrenic, like the third part, which is all about, you know, Robert Downey Junior's Junior's character being like a villain. It sort of ends with this, you know, there's this brilliant scene that I think everyone remembers where they show him giving a speech to all the people at Los Alamos and then they show like him envisioning bodies um in in you know in in Hiroshima, right? And and you kind of see the justosition. You see him sort of losing his his sort of um his his sort of you know conviction that he did the right thing. And I feel like if they had just stopped the movie there, it would have been the commentary on like okay like we don't really understand his legacy. But instead they had to tie it up with it was almost like if you know for for writers and artists like if you don't know how to end something you kind of tie things up with neat bows that have nothing to do with the thing that happened before. And it felt like the third section on the security clearance and on him being a hero was almost like the filmmaker's apology. Like actually, no, no, I'm going to side I'm actually going to paint this for everyone and side that he was actually a good man and and there's there's no sort of moral ambiguity about this this figure. like he was actually a good man and actually the the real villains are the national security hawks and the people in Washington and the bureaucrats and like and then it was just this sort of portrayal of you know the evil bureaucracy coming for the beautiful scientists and and it sort of mimicked I think also a conversation that was happening in 2023 when it came out which is all of these great AI scientists basically saying oh well no AI is actually going to kill us all and you know I know this because I'm an expert it was like the same sort of thing and I kind of felt like that was also the the sort language of the end of the film is like, "No, no, it's normal for people who who build incredible things to like actually regret their innovation." And it just felt like way too buttoned up for a film that has a lot more complexity and that if they had just ended it at hour two, it would have been a masterpiece.
>> Yeah. It felt like it wanted to conform with present day morale like very badly.
>> Yeah.
>> Um Yeah. Exactly. Um and so that anyway, so that's my like long extended argument for why Leo Strauss was actually the hero of the movie. U was correct. uh Oppenheimer could not be trusted. Oppenheimer needed to be rejected from the project. Also, Lewis Strauss is shown in the movie as being very jealous of of Einstein, but if you squint, you could say he also had Einstein's number. He knew Einstein was not to be trusted. Um uh which was 100% true. And then yeah, Katherine to your point like it like if you again I guess exactly right what you just said the comparison to AI like if you read the history of of those people at that time specifically people like Oppenheimer you realize yeah the people who invent the technology have no special moral claim. uh they have no special predictive power for the consequence of the technology and they have no no basis for a superior moral claim on the implications of the technology. Um and and I will say this the movie you know the movie being made by geniuses like there was a scene in the movie that actually did kind of hit that uh which was which was which was based on a real life thing that happened which was Oenheimer after the war visited Harry Truman at the in the White House. Um and basically and and this is sort of in in the histories in the real world histories Oenheimer basically went to Truman and bas essentially basically confessed enormous guilt uh for having built the atomic bomb and for for having you know for the US having dropped it on on Japan and and actually in real life Truman is I forget the exact quote but it's in the Truman biographies. Uh you know Truman basically said uh it basically uh you know basically like got him out of his office as fast as possible and told his chief of staff like I think I think the exact line was never let that weepy son of a in here again. Um, and then I think the line of the movie is based on something Truman apparently actually said, which was, you know, Robert, you didn't make the decision to drop the bomb. It's not on you. I made the decision. Right. Which, right, which which is like which is like an incredibly powerful thing, which is the dulyeleed commander-in-chief of the country made that decision as he should have that the the the scientist does not have the moral authority to decide how the technology is used. It's it's the it's it's our, you know, in our system of of government that the the commander-in-chief has that authority, you know, in our elected representatives. Um, and so I like to the movie's enormous credit, it did include that. It did show that. Um, and again like in my fantasy cut of the movie, that's the end of the movie. Um, so they kind of nodded that, but like like I said, they then then they let then then they let him off the hook um uh at the end.
>> Shall we close with uh with Fight Club?
>> Fight Club. Well, we could spend an entire we could spend hours on just Fight Club and we probably should at some point. I I will just say about Fight Club. Bike Club's an amazing I it's like I think it's I I think it's it's 100% true art with capital A. I think it's amazing. I think it's you know definitely going to stand the test of time, you know, already is. Um and it's one of those movies and it's it's one of those movies that has that characteristic we talked about last time where like if you watched it the week it came out versus a year later versus 5 years later versus 10 years later versus 20 years versus 30 years later. Like it it has new meanings uh as as as our society evolves and and it's got and you can kind of you can kind at any kind of point in time you can kind of use it as a prism on our society. Um it's it's it's amazing in retrospect. I guess my my sort of so social political kind of kind of analysis of it would be like it was clearly intended as a leftwing movie um at the time because it was sort of it was sort of um and you know and the novel that you know this the famous novel that it's based on you know and sort of this you know almost like what was it remember the original like there's the sort of leftwing anti- capitalism of that era like leftwing anarchism um you know a little bit like that you know the '90s version of like Luigi leftism or something where it's like you know capitalism is this you know basically this horrible right-wing machine that's like crushing everybody's spirits Um and of course in the movie Andart in place you know sort of an office drone who just like absticates his life. Um and you know has no future in my case himself and you know ends up doing all all the things that that you know kind of play out in the movie which you know and then by the way the movie culminates in basically the the the destruction of capitalism. Um you know basically what is it he they they they he takes down the buildings containing I think it's like all the what is it all the bank records or credit card records uh to kind of you know wipe the slate clean and start start the economy and society over again. Um, so at the time it's just like, wow, that's like a really leftwing message. And of course it's, you know, it's like it's, you know, David Fincher and it's Edn Brad Pitt. It's like one of the best most entertaining, you know, most captivating movies ever made. It's it's phenomenal, but like it's fundamentally a leftwing movie. You watch it today and you're just like, "Wow, it's like ultra rightwing." Like it's like ultra ultra ultra rightwing cuz it's a to start with it's a white guy, right? Um, right. And so like it's literally you view it today and you're like wow it's you know it's it's you know the stereotype would be it's a right you know it's a it's a it's a white you know it's a privileged white male incel uh you know basically right u you know with like every advantage in the world who suddenly you know nevertheless has built up this persecution complex right and you just lines you're just like wow that's like an ultra right-wing movie and then by the way the the sort of argument the movie makes about like capitalism is like the great you know atomization of society and like nobody has any type anything and people are just like interchangeable cogs in the great you know kind of you know in the great kind of machine of modernity um you know they kind of put on this assembly line through complete meaningless until they die and like all concept of like family and community is like completely ruptured and like capitalism is like you know basically the machine that does that you know neoliberal capitalism is the machine that does that like sitting here today that's a rightman critique um and so and so I I I probably shouldn't name names but I did talk to somebody who was involved in the making of the movie because I don't want to it was a I don't want to I don't want to represent his his views but I specifically by name, but I talked to somebody who made the movie and I laid up my theory that it was a leftwing movie at the time and now it's a right movie. And this this person basically said, "Oh, no." He's like, it's very clear in the movie that at the end, you know, that he greatly regrets what he's doing. Like, you know, he he like has, you know, he's filled with regret. Like, it's a very, you know, kind of sad tragic ending. Um, and and I was like, "Oh, well then if you just like used AI to just go in there and tweak the final scene of of the Ed Norton character standing, you know, watching the buildings come down and if you just tweak the final scene to where he would have like a sly little smile on his face, like all of a sudden like the entire movie becomes like this, you know, basically ultra rightwing from start to finish." Um, and anyway, I I'll pause there. I just I just got to say whichever way you interpret it, like I think that movie definitely is definitely a art. I think it's amazing. I think it'll I think people will be watching it and discussing it, you know, 100 years from now.
>> Yeah. to to bring it back to the original thesis of this podcast, monitoring the situation that's going on in the internet. Um, what went viral this week related to Fight Club was the PSAs that Brad Pitt and Edward Norton put out before the movie came out in theaters. And if you have I won't this is one thing I won't spoil, but it was going viral like why don't we make PSAs about like staying silent in the theater like this uh anymore. You have to watch it. It's like 90 seconds. Um, and it just confirms that Brad Pitt is the goat. he is hilarious. Um, and that he puts serious thought into everything he does, including the please stay quiet in the theater uh PSAs that went out before the movie came out in theaters 25 years ago. So, watch it. Uh, I'm glad it's going viral again. And we should definitely make actors do those PSAs for theaters.
>> So, Katherine, that movie came out in what year?
>> 1999.
>> 99. Yeah. 1999,
>> which is kind of universally I remember like a year of like absolutely amazing movies.
>> Yes. Maybe that maybe the best single year for movies in the last like 40 years. Yes.
>> Or longer. So um question um could that movie So number one is that movie was at least according to the accounts that I've read that movie was very difficult to make. Um and then once they had in the can like people the original people who saw it like were you know it was just like a lot of people just like didn't know what to make of it you know cuz there's a very simplistic reading of it right which is just like total nihilism and like just destruction and you know sex and violence you know to no purpose. It's one of those movies where like you you have to have a lens on the movie. You have to have an idea of the movie or the movie has to get its idea across to you and you have to you have to catch the idea before you can actually watch it properly because if you just watch it otherwise it just seems like it's just like tremendously nihilistic which I you know very much I very much don't believe that it is but uh you know I think it was very controversial at the time u it was very hard to get made you know it's it was misinterpreted by many people over the years and by the way the people who made it me is misinterpreting it um and so that movie could get made during that era. Could that movie have gotten made uh after the '90s?
>> I I feel like it's the like the consumate 90s film,
>> right? Like like just the the as you said like the critique on consumerism like the uh sort of early critique on um you know kind of the consumerism affecting masculine like traits, right? like like the whole the whole reaction of you know we're going to have a fight club to kind of reclaim our our masculinity and sort of our life and our you know that that felt like was actually I mean it's it's interesting because it's the same critique it's the same conversation that's happening right now but it really was also a '9s conversation um just sort of you know and that's the same thing as um I believe 1999 was also American Beauty and that's a similar sort of like all of these movies had the same sort of to your point nihilism but sort of this David Foster Wallaceesque sort of consumerism M is destroying us. We're moving to the suburbs and we have to reclaim in some way. And like the sort of I I I don't like the portrayal of any man feeling like constrained in their, you know, it was it was always sort of like the consumerism and the suburbanization of America is destroying sort of like masculine freedom, right? So there were like that was like a very '9s
>> coded end of the '9s film era. Like I don't So part of me is like I don't I it could probably be made but it would probably be made with totally different ethos and maybe a totally different take on that um thesis now. Like the thesis is slightly different than what it was in the '9s which is that like you know like Walmart is destroying you, right? Like it's a very different now it's like tech is destroying you but at the time it was Walmart and capitalism are destroying you.
>> Mark Katherine thanks so much for for coming on and talking about movies again.
>> Awesome. Thank you so much Mark. Don't be
