basically America puts in this oil embargo and knows that the outcome of failed negotiations on getting rid of that embargo is a total World War of this kind and it's not even for the main strategic objective which is you know you got to get Hitler you got to get beat Germany wasn't this just our failure of grand strategy to realize why are we doing this hold on we weren't fighting Germany the only reason we fought Germany is because Hitler made a major blunder he had an alliance with Japan that said if Japan was attacked he would come in now with Japan attacked someone else that he would come in he interprets it broadly and he declares war on this country that is how the the United States got into World War II if Hiller had not made that blunder FDR would have been in a world of trouble trying to explain why he's suddenly going to be fighting Nazis over an attack on Pearl Harbor by Japanese so that's a separate issue the main thing that Americans who thought deeply cared about is the International System that we should deal with each other through laws through freedom of navig a so this is how you run your commercial transactions that big countries don't get to overrun small countries because if they do the entire International System goes down and the logic that you're describing is excellent logic and this is what the Japanese are saying it's like why would the Americans care about this Americans care deeply about the International System and it's also like why why not let the Russians eat all of Ukraine why are the Europeans suddenly all over this problem right right and they've unified very recently uh on this it's because the whole system is at stake so it is really high stakes at a strategic level the Japanese are looking at the operational level and going why do you care about these countries uh we care about the entire system because our prosperity is based on it so I wonder if the problem here is that America isn't at least at the time wasn't willing to give enough concessions to the factions within Japan that care about peace so that they can save face and actually argue for ending War where just the idea that they're going to give up manua as well obviously that's not going to happen and when Secretary of H just sees these vacillating telegrams from the Japanese he assumes it's because they're like they're fickle or something it's like no it's a civilian part of the government like trying its best to prevent the military from taking over and you gotta you got to give them something to save face you know um that faction had already lost and they lost in 1936 Takahashi corio is Japan's longest suring Finance Minister and he was a very distinguished man in fact he brought the Japanese economy out of the Great Depression before uh anyone in the west was doing it through government spending and trying to get people to spend at home and he told the Army he said fellas if you go on this bent for Empire you're not going to actually get resources because you're going to spend a lot of money fighting with people resources doing that and then it's going to take you years of Investments to access these resources so you got to be able to cover these Investments for years and years and years and he's say cooperate with in the International System that is the way to prosperity for Japan well that was the February young officer Revolt where he and I can't remember how many others were murdered they came to his home in the middle of the night and as he stood up to talk to them they literally hacked him apart they had lost that that that whole game is over but Prince canoy doesn't like he knows he's going to the person who's prime minister in 1941 realizes that they're going to lose a war against America and he doesn't want to do that it's just that Tojo the war minister at the time doesn't answer to him like there are people that the prime minister is like doesn't want war and we don't give him enough to save face wait they have a huge Army there that's more than capable of assassinating people and they get in the way so that ship is sailed that you can make this is what a pivotal decision is once you've made it there's no going back to the way the world was and Japan it lost too many people and uh there are too many figures in the Army it's um we think that it's an inevitable outcome of having the world the way it is now with this Japan this a uh wonderful country now at the lead of so many different level areas of human endeavor and we think oh that's the inevitable outcome it's not I guess what I'm trying to ask you is is there anything America could have done in the immediate years leading up to the war they could have prevented this outcome because you should assume that if there is a World War things weren't done optimally right doesn't mean everybody's equally at fault but is there anything that could smoo but but like in the Years but this is serious holy smooth tariff is a game of halfcourt tennis you're looking at the United States it's in a terrible depression you want to protect jobs here and so you raise these big tariff walls and then okay what's the other side net going to do they're going to raise their tariff walls and pay you back what's that going to do it's going to cost a lot of American jobs if you play that game you need to be talking with other people so uh once you have set the conditions Hot House conditions for fascists to take over in Germany and in Japan you are in a world of hurt the easy solutions are no longer there anymore so maybe I'll ask the question this way the oil embargo was it a mistake because it's the idea is to protect the International System prevent Empire well we got more Empire we got a World War we got communist taking over in China whatever was going to happen if we got rid of the O embargo can't have been worse than that right well what yeah it was what Roosevelt was really scared of was that the Japanese would attack Russia he was so because then he thought Russia would fall and Russia fell he thought the Nazis would win so at least when the Japanese attacked they attacked us that was actually better than attacking Russia so the oil embargo um so let's say you don't do it and Japan never attacks us and then the uh Russians are down and you've got um Nazis in control of the world so must me better doesn't seem and but you don't have the world war with America like it doesn't seem insane to think that and we're still going to find the Nazis you're not going to have an International System and the Nazis were gearing up because eventually they're going to fight us to keep pushing back on this the I don't have an answer I've given you what little I can think but I hey I'm Not The Grand properer in this world these com these questions you're asking me are way above my pay grade so people in the YouTube comment section get mad at me when I when I keep asking about like counterfactuals um and I understand you know obviously I don't understand what's happening at the time I'm naive about history whatever but I do think important what what what are we trying to do when we try to understand history we're trying to understand if we had done things differently what would have happened what are the lessons we take and counter the main way we can do that yeah yeah I'm all for it um we teach by counterfactuals is replay it and can you come up with different options I think you're in a series of really awful options it just seems like naturally if we didn't go to war with them we might have been allies as we ended up being later on well they attacked us and the Embargo yeah yeah yeah but but the question is like should we got thego but wait a the Japanese are saying we have the rights to your oil excuse me we have the right to sell it or not sell it to anyone we feel like right it's I mean what since when do they have the rights to it okay great so you're gonna do all this crazy stuff and then still think we have to sell you oil and oh by the way this oil is being used to kill Chinese all over the place this is what the what their Japanese bombers are running on yeah I feel like no I mean I morally I agree we don't like they don't own our oil the question is like it's not about uh like do are they entitled to it it's like should we have given it to them would the outcome have been better if we did um I'm tell you I suspect the outcome wouldn't have been better but I don't know right and you're asking me things where my experience is I'm just a professor I just you know show up at seminar on time and I try to do reading and prep and my experience has not been in government let alone at the highest echelons of government of what's feasible and what's not feasible the answers I've given you are uh where I'm at but I don't I can't tell you more all right sorry I'll ask about other things too if you enjoy this clip with the naval war
