One of the big technological problems
in 1929
was that the quote unquote,
big board at the New York Stock Exchange
would often fall behind
literally by hours.
So you could be looking at the board
thinking that,
you know what the score is, if you will,
what the price of the stock is.
But it would literally be hours off.
And that's if you're physically
on the floor of the exchange.
The folks on the floor
were then calling all the brokerage houses
around the country,
and even uptown in New York,
to tell them what the numbers were.
And so their numbers
were hopelessly out of date.
And, you know, when you see pictures of,
you know, thousands of people
on the streets of Wall Street,
those famous pictures in October of 1929,
the reason there were so many people
in the streets, people had gone down there
physically because they wanted to see
what was actually happening
to their investments,
because you couldn't call somebody.
There was no app to look at.
And that unto itself
created a real dilemma.
Putting aside what was going
on, by the way, on some of these boats,
you know, people were trading on boats.
Those guys were,
you know, half a day, a day,
they're sending pigeon carriers
pretty much the way the stock price.
Hello, and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lodge podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy, it's been a theme in a lot of our
episodes lately, but we are in an age
where trading and speculation
is just part of the culture.
We know that stocks are up,
we know that a lot of things are up,
but that's different than being part
of pop culture, which it is now.
It's a culture of lines. Lines going up.
People watch the lines.
I really think that
if you're walking down the street
or on the subway
and you see like a guy staring down,
there's a good chance that he's like
looking at a Bitcoin chart again.
Yeah. Any given moment.
Well,
this was one of the things about Bitcoin.
It was so volatile.
There was actually something to watch.
There's like an entertainment factor.
But of course when you get this kind
of speculative activity
everyone starts worrying about
when's it going to end.
It's the crash.
I have this theory
that nobody likes bubbles,
that basically if there is a bubble,
there are two camps of people.
One camp that is really upset
that they're missing out on it,
and one camp that is really anxious
that they're going to miss the top,
and that there are actually
very few people in the camp
where it's like,
oh, this is like really good.
I'm really happy.
I'm really, really
the people who nailed the timing
are pretty pleased with themselves,
I assume.
And there's like five of those. Yeah.
You know, like
that's the problem afterwards.
So it's like, oh, I sold the top,
I feel good.
Yeah, absolutely.
Okay, so famous crashes.
We're going to talk about one of them.
You know,
I remember the.com era very well.
I don't remember the, the,
the in market environment,
we're going to talk about, the 1920s.
You you have no memory of that.
Shame on you.
I don't remember 1929 very well.
I did read, John Kenneth Galbraith,
his famous book, The Crash.
But there is a new book out on the great
stock market boom and then crash of 1929.
We are going to be speaking with
the author, someone I'm thrilled to talk
to, someone who's accomplishments and work
ethic puts us all to shame.
We're going to be speaking
with the one and only Andrew Ross Sorkin,
founder of Dealbook
at New York Times, co-creator of billions,
co-host of some Squawk Box CNBC.
I made that joke about, Jim
Ryan as if I'd never heard the network.
And now the author of 1929 Inside
the Greatest Crash in History
and How It Shattered a Nation.
Andrew,
thank you so much for coming on at lunch.
Thrilled to have you here.
Thank you for having me.
I feel like I'm a long time listener,
first time caller.
Amazing. Thank you.
How do you, so this isn't the first time
1929 has been written about.
And the Galbraith book, it's probably like
those up until now, probably the most.
It was a great book. Yeah.
What was the impulse to go back and write
a book about this, this period of time?
To be honest with you,
it was about ten years ago.
I had written Too Big to fail.
People used to ask me
because I had written
about the financial crisis of 2008.
They'd ask me questions about 1929.
And the truth was, I didn't really
have answers because I sort of knew,
I think, like most of the public today,
that something pretty bad happened.
Then.
I had read the Galbraith book,
but sort of beyond that,
I was lacking details, and I honestly,
I went on a vacation and, you may think
there's like a nerdy vacation thing to do.
I, downloaded some books to Kindle, and I
brought some more with me all about 1929.
I sort of pored through them,
and I thought to myself,
why can't
I understand who the characters are?
Like the people at a visceral level?
Like, what were they saying to each other?
What were their motivations
for their incentives?
Who was sleeping with who?
What was really happening here?
And, you know,
I grew up sort of loving books like,
you know, That Word and by Michael Lewis
or Jim Stewart with, with
den of Thieves.
You mentioned A Night to Remember or.
Well, a Night to Remember with
the Titanic was a great example
of a book that really sort of made things
feel human.
Right. And so I thought, you know, what?
Could somebody and maybe it was me
do that to 1929.
And the truth was, I wasn't sure I could.
One of the reasons I think there's so long
is, was the entire time I wasn't sure.
And when I first started it, actually,
I mean, started doing the research
or many of the archivists
that I went to visit
with were like,
Andrew, we've read Too Big to Fail.
That kind of granular detail, it's
just too hard to find.
And by the way,
all the people are dead, obviously.
So there's nobody interviewing you.
You're really reliant on letters
and notes and memos and transcripts.
And the truth is, there wasn't like two
or 3 or 4 major archives.
You could sort of go excavate.
And so this turned into this
sort of bizarre,
you know, years long project of putting
these puzzle pieces together.
I can only imagine how much archival
research you had to do for this book.
It is very filled with texture and
personality and lots and lots of details.
Is there a particular character that
kind of stuck out to you in this book?
And I'm, you know, I've read about Charles
Mitchell.
He's sort of the villain.
But then towards the end of it,
you have a sort of more nuanced opinion.
So I think there's a couple characters.
And the truth is,
I would also say one other thing,
because then you will probably end up
talking about today,
like modern day today.
When I started writing this book,
I never even thought about today.
I was thinking, really about
then I didn't think I was because
if this is the top this year,
you nailed the book, but the so.
But as I was working on this,
these characters to me,
like Charlie Mitchell who ran a bank on
National City was become Citigroup.
You know the parallels to me between him,
he effectively invented
sort of modern credit for lending,
if you will, to individuals to go
and buy stock.
I mean, to me, he would back
then he would have been as famous
as a Jamie Diamond of today.
He might have been
the Michael Milken of his time.
In certain ways,
he might have been even like a dick fold,
kind of character from Lehman Brothers.
So I was fascinated with Charlie Mitchell,
and he was actually one of the hardest,
characters to really write,
because there really is no archive.
He didn't keep his own notes.
It was really dependent on actually
finding other archives of letters
and things that he, participated in.
He was on the board of the New York Fed,
and I was able to get the minutes
from those fed meetings
for the first time.
And that really actually sort of
grounded the project.
I became fascinated by John Rascoff,
who to me is like Elon Musk in the 1920s.
He was everywhere all the time.
Philosopher king.
Helped, run General Motors created
really credit at General Motors,
which really changed America.
That's actually when people started
taking on credit for the first time
goes on to play the market,
goes on to get involved in politics.
He actually tried to undermine Hoover's
reputation as sort of a muskie
kind of way, if you will,
and then goes to build what was then
the equivalent of a spaceship
in the Empire State Building.
And meanwhile,
I, I don't know if he gets credit for it,
but he really did, to some degree,
come up with the idea at least, or
became an advocate
for a five day workweek in America.
People
forget that were six days back then,
and he thought it was an equity
would be an economic boon because people
would have go and spend your money,
go spend money to buy cars.
They'll have to go play golf.
Time to go places, do all sorts.
So I thought he was fascinating.
And then the last person, Carter glass.
Carter glass of Glass-Steagall,
Glass-Steagall fame.
He was a senator in Virginia.
By the way, he
helped create the bill that led
to the creation of the Federal Reserve.
But he was the Elizabeth Warren
of his time,
and he used to rail for years
about this thing called Mitchell ism
and this idea that Charlie Mitchell
and the creation of debt and leverage
and the system was
what was going to undo it.
The, the Galbraith book talks
a lot about the,
I guess, what were they that the
they were before mutual funds.
What were they called? The trusts.
Investment trusts. Investment trusts.
But your book talks a lot about this
idea of like retail leverage, basically
which way you described.
And it sounds like
a lot of these characters basically.
And you talking about
they would say, okay, we've taught people
that they can buy a car on margin
or a car on credit or a dishwasher.
Why not a stock?
And it seems like they really transport
a lot of people in industry
really sort of transported this
consumer notion that was nascent
and just like, yeah, let's put it over.
I didn't appreciate that back then.
I mean, brokerages were springing up
on the corners of streets
the way they're like Starbucks in New York
City is really fun.
I always think about these
or like the brokerage on a cruise is like,
would be fun to just walk in
and play the market.
You mentioned lounges in
like hotels, women only stock
trading lessons,
which, you know, I would go for those.
Nowadays they don't have to be women only,
but just the place for thing.
That was nuts though, is you would show up
and you could give them a dollar
and they would literally lend you ten.
I mean, that's
what we're talking about. Yeah.
And so when the market was going up,
it really was like free money.
And I think this was the first time
this was ever really happening.
And so people didn't fully appreciate
all the things that were possible.
Let's just say there's
another parallel with today,
which is a lot of the stock market
being driven by AI.
Right? And when people talk about
the market opportunity
in AI, it's basically uncapped.
It's the entire world.
It's like all of business.
And in the 1920s, people were saying
stocks were going to go up
because the entire world
was buying into the US.
I think that's very true.
I would actually specifically point
actually to a technology story back then,
which was radio.
Radio.
The ticker symbol was radio.
The company was RCA.
They also, by the way,
not only had the technology for radio,
they had the patents for television.
And that was the Nvidia
I mean, that was the meme stock,
of that era, because people were buying
into this future
that we were all going to experience,
and they wouldn't have been wrong,
by the way,
the conundrum is, I
think the stock split adjusted at the peak
was like got to 530 some odd dollars
and by 1932 was like $3.
Obviously, when radio, come to RCA, you're
like, oh, it's the Nvidia of the time.
Nvidia makes a ton of money
and it makes more money every year.
Well,
we don't know how sustainable that is
because some of that is them investing in
companies which come back and buy Nvidia.
But setting that aside,
vendor financing was radio making.
It was RCA making a ton of money.
Or was it mostly excitement
about the future?
Do we have radios financials from the 20s?
So the bad news is we don't.
In fact,
somebody said to me, the other day,
did you ever get a chance to look
at the prospectuses of these stocks?
And I said, prospectuses.
They they hardly had leaflets.
I mean, and that's if they had anything,
they literally would be leaflets
that they would hand to their PS
ratios going the
it was very hard to get real information.
Again.
This is pre the creation of the SEC,
the kind of rules and regulations
and just disclosures just didn't exist
in the same way that they do today.
So would you just get like a check
in the mail for a dividend
every once in a while.
Like what access did you actually have.
So my understanding
is that you would get a check in the mail.
In fact, oftentimes
it wouldn't come in the mail.
You'd actually go to the brokerage house
itself.
And in some cases
they would keep that for you and sometimes
either reinvest it
or keep it on like a ledger, if you will.
But I don't know,
the specifics exactly of how
of how you would, deal with your dividend.
Yeah. When it, if you got it.
One thing I really like in the book
is all these different characters
from American, from world history.
You telling the story of them
getting really obsessed with the U.S.
stock market.
So Winston Churchill, on an early trip
to the United States
gets really into margin trading, I think,
like you're talking about Groucho Marx
and getting really.
And so to me,
that was also like a great surprise.
And that was also not
something I had read about.
I had no idea that Winston Churchill
shows up in New York, actually
just been in the US even before this.
But in New York in October of 1929,
he was actually down on the floor
of the stock exchange, visiting.
While this was all happening,
he was totally engrossed in trading.
He was trying to make money.
He ends up losing, losing money,
of course, like everybody else,
he ends up going to a dinner
with all the leading bankers.
The night that the market
completely and utterly tanks.
And similarly, I didn't know about it
either.
But, you know, Groucho
Marx was living in Long Island
and basically I should say
that he was living on land,
but he would, according to his son,
he was really living at a brokerage house
trying to reshape every day.
And he ends up having to, mortgage
his home to pay
for the margin calls when they called.
Some people did make money.
Going back to our intro, very few people
managed to make money, but,
some of them did. And spectacular amounts.
Can you talk a little bit
about Jesse Livermore?
The great Jesse Livermore?
There's been a lot written about Jesse
Livermore.
Just. Livermore was a character
in this book.
Of course,
I don't know if we should give away
the ending for those who don't know, but
Jesse Livermore
ultimately shoots himself in the head.
In 1941 over at the Sherry Netherland.
There's a lot of people shooting
themselves in the head in this book.
There's a lot of shooting,
jumping out windows and other things.
But, you know, Jesse was a short seller
and he was spectacularly successful
in the crash itself.
The truth was, though, he had been
super successful in parts of the 20s
and then was actually quite a quite
a failure in most of 27 and 28
and 29 because the market kept going up
and he was almost out of business.
And then he goes back in, in, in,
in the fall of 29 and makes
something like $100 million plus.
But of course,
like I think any of these sort
of super emotionally,
complicated people,
he ultimately loses it,
I mean, quickly and then,
you know, makes makes it a little bit
more, loses a little bit more,
makes a little bit more, and then loses.
Well, everything.
You said that when you started this book,
it would, you know,
you started a decade ago.
So it was not about some attempt
to make a parallel today,
even though the timing may be
things are very crazy these days.
Many people would say when you as a.
I've always been curious about this
when I read history of any sort,
the brain can't help
but try to find parallels to this.
I think, at least for me, it's like,
oh, this is just like this.
There's just like this.
When you're doing the process
of writing history,
do you have any mechanisms in place
to avoid the temptation
to sort of over draw parallels?
Because that must be incredibly
tempting to find the details
that feel salient and similar today.
This is the Nvidia of the time.
This is the Cathie Wood of the time.
This is the whatever.
So yes and no.
I think it wasn't until two years ago when
I was getting closer to being finished,
and also to recognizing what was happening
in the moment today.
And the parallels
started to seem clearer and closer.
So three and four years ago, actually,
it didn't feel.
Yeah, as similar, oddly enough.
But all of a sudden you're starting
to see these debates that they're having
in literally the spring of 1929
about whether to raise
or lower interest rates
and how they're going to try
to end speculation
within the New York Fed and
to some degree, the political pressures
that are around them.
And you start to say,
well, that seems kind of I,
I've been hearing a lot about that.
So I was I hesitated to sort of overdo it.
But I also was cognizant that I imagined
readers who were reading
it might think about some of these things.
And one of the decisions
we made in particular, I remember having
lots of debates with my editor
about was nowhere in the book
did we ever want to stop the reader
and take you out of 1929.
Say, hey, by the way, this is kind of
like that, or this is kind of like that.
Some readers may see these parallels
or different things themselves.
Some may never see them,
and some may come up
with completely different parallels.
And I would love that.
Frankly, I have a parallel.
Okay.
So, something that happened slightly
after the crash is Smoot-Hawley, right?
Yes. The tariffs.
And today
we are in the Trump administration
with a very broad, widespread tariffs.
And that wasn't on my bingo card
when I was writing that originally.
I'm curious how much of the subsequent
Great Depression would you attribute
to those sorts of economic policies versus
the stock market crash itself?
So I actually think there was a lot of bad
decisions
and dominoes
that came after the crash itself.
That really is
what put us into the Great Depression.
So I look at the crash
and and really, only the first half of
this book is about the crash itself
as sort of the first domino
of a series of things
that were sort of the necessary
ingredients to create the depression.
So, you know,
when you think about all of the bad
decisions,
the tariffs are one of those decisions.
You know, the idea that Andrew Mellon,
who is our Treasury secretary,
who was effectively saying, you know, let
these capitalists eat it,
they were speculating, let them suffer.
You know, when you think about the fact
that the fed really did
very little at the time
and almost sat on their hands,
in large part, I would argue, because
the fed was such a new institution.
People forget who was born in 1913, that
they were
cognizant of the political pressures.
If they were seen, they couldn't
have pulled off a Volcker like moved.
They knew there was speculation
that if they had said, okay, we're going
to really just raise interest rates.
By the way, it wasn't
they were going to lose their jobs.
I think they actually feared that
maybe there wouldn't be a fed.
So I think there was sort
of the confluence
of all of these different things.
We talked about the gold standard.
I mean, there's sort of a series of things
that that take place that lead
eventually to 9000 banks going out
of business and unemployment at 25%.
It's interesting,
speaking of the fed, because these days
there's all this question of like,
we're looking at financial conditions,
we're looking at real economy, etc.
it's interesting
how maybe the fed didn't do enough,
to curb speculation,
or maybe at some point it was,
didn't do enough
to counteract the downturn,
but they were very keyed
in to the rate on margin
lending as one of their main tools
that they had in their toolkit.
So that was their big tool
or what they thought was their tool.
However, they didn't really use it.
And so you had this sort of fascinating
debate happening in the spring of 1929,
when they're sitting there saying,
there's too much speculation.
We need to end the speculation.
How do we do that?
Well, the decision
they came to effectively was to send out
letters to banks saying,
please stop lending to speculators.
General suasion, right.
To which the bankers said,
what are you talking about?
How do you define what speculator is?
What what isn't?
One some of the banks were so scared
that they effectively stopped
lending that unto itself was a problem.
And then you had people like Charlie
Mitchell, who, by the way, in that moment,
you would have compared to Donald Trump
saying
actually lower interest rates, please.
So I think there was this
sort of fascinating dynamic
that you could sort of see play out again,
these are some of the details.
I don't think I understood the texture of
of what really led to all of this.
There's another parallel.
Speaking of the fed,
this might be, you know, pressing it,
stretching it a little bit,
but I get the sense that nowadays
people feel that the fed can come up
with any solution to any problem.
Right.
We've seen them roll out tons
and tons of different programs,
whether it's for corporate credit
or repo treasuries, that sort of thing.
In the
1920s, there was a sense that America
had beaten the boom bust cycle, right?
Because there was another crash
previously, which was 1907.
Look again,
I think this is one of those things where,
because of the 1907 experience,
which, by the way, was solved
effectively by JP Morgan
taking a bunch of bankers
and trapping them in a room
until they could figure out
what they were going to do,
led to a sort of sense of overconfidence
and not just overconfidence, a sense
among certain men, men of a certain group,
if you will, that if you could just
put the right people in a room together,
we could solve anything.
Thomas Lamont was effectively running
JP Morgan during this period.
JP Morgan himself had died.
His son Jack was the CEO in name,
but really, Thomas
was running, things
and he was one of those kind of believers.
But I think that 1929
and what happened in the markets
just got got so far away from them
that they realized
that there was nothing
ultimately, in the end, they could do.
And they didn't know that
until it was too late.
So 1907, literally
a hundred years before our crash.
And then the,
that the great financial crisis
that leading to all of this overconfidence
that there
is just an endless series of tools
that the government has to stop anything.
And then we get to the ninth.
You're making your own paranoid sound.
How do you not how do you
how can you know what the brain does?
And I don't even like I'm.
I'm not even arguing. There's a parallel.
I just think that the brain naturally
sees these things and we can't avoid it.
And by the way,
we're not 25, so we still have 44 years.
Now, this is not financial advice,
but before here's I'm going to try
and make my money.
Wait, maybe this I'm going to ask you.
So I don't know if there's
you may not even want to answer.
This could be like a really good movie
or TV show on Netflix.
Oh, yeah. Yes.
I thought it's very gilded,
very Gilded Age.
Yeah, I had that thought, too. Or you can.
Can you give us a little news here?
I don't have any news for you.
You know, happy creator of billions.
Happily, there's a bunch of, folks
in Hollywood who've been reaching out
recently, and and there's
some conversations going on, but.
Okay, no news.
And, I, you know, it's
one of those crossed your fingers.
Kind of.
We can officially say that
we think it would be a good show.
We want cameos. Yeah, we want cameos.
We can organize that. True.
This is a period piece,
so we're going to have to I love it.
Yeah.
Tracy could be the,
the astrologer that hangs out
at the Algonquin Livestock
Tip Plaza Hotel.
Tell us about that.
So you're talking about Evangeline Adams?
Yeah, she was an astrologer.
And an astrologer who was taken shockingly
seriously at that time
by all sorts of finance.
Here's, before he died, J.P.
Morgan himself was famous
for going to visit with her.
She had an office in Carnegie Hall,
and she would literally sit
inside the Plaza Hotel,
and people would come up and talk to her
and visit the chatter newsletter.
And she had and then and by the way,
interestingly, in October of 1929,
as the market is crashing
and people don't always appreciate
the crash really happened over
several days, it was not just one bad day.
She would have these almost like seances
where people would come to her office
and she wasn't doing one
on ones at that point because it was
the groups were so big.
She was summoning the animal spirits. Yes.
And she was she was praying for,
of course, for high stock prices.
Interestingly, she got a lot of credit
for the stock market boom
because in the fall of 29, I think right
after Labor Day in September,
a reporter called her and asked her
what was in the stars course.
She told everybody that the market
was going to go up.
Yeah.
There's
another thing that you write
about in your book, which, again,
could be a potential parallel, which is,
I guess, the role of technology back then.
And I'm thinking about the recent
banking crisis,
mini drama, whatever you want to call it,
where, you know, rumors
about the health of the bank
flew around really, really quickly.
On social media and in private chat groups
and things like that.
And some people thought
that contributed to a lot of the,
the problems in the 1929 crash,
how quickly did information disseminate
and how quickly were the share price
drops, actually,
you know, reflected on the exchanges
and communicated
to other people glacially.
So one of the big technological problems
in 1929
was that the quote unquote, big board,
the New York Stock Exchange,
would often fall behind
literally by hours.
So you could be looking at the board
thinking that, you know what
the score is, if you will,
what the price of the stock is.
But it would literally be hours off.
And that's if you're physically
on the floor of the exchange.
The folks on the floor were then calling
all the brokerage houses
around the country
and even uptown in New York,
to tell them what the numbers were.
And so their numbers
were hopelessly out of date.
And, you know, when you see pictures of,
you know, thousands of people
on the streets of Wall Street,
those famous pictures in October of 1929,
the reason
there were so many people in the streets,
people had gone down there physically
because they wanted to see
what was actually happening
to their investments,
because you couldn't call somebody.
There was no app to look at.
And that unto itself
created a real dilemma.
Putting aside what was going
on, by the way, on some of these, boats,
you know, people were trading on boats.
Those guys were,
you know, half a day, a day,
they're sending pigeon carriers
pretty much only the stock price.
Well, Jesse Livermore,
like he had his own phone lines, right?
He was sort of. He was the Citadel.
I was literally going to say,
who was the Ken Griffin setting up
a satellite in his dorm
or any one of these people
who later on try to get a faster line
to the exchange with microwave towers?
He did that with phone lines,
he did with phone lines and his own people
literally down on the floor, that within
calling in the bids back to his office
so that he would have better information
than other people.
Phone
lines were the Lindy latency of the time.
Yeah. They were. That's what I say.
Okay, another parallel.
I'm just going to throw I love it.
And you can agree or disagree
with Andrew Ross Sorkin of the time.
Okay, there you go.
Was there an Andrew Ross
Sorkin of the time?
Well there was an Alexander Noyes was
the business editor of The New York Times.
And he was pretty respected guy.
So I think that would have been.
So that's I would I would take that.
All right.
There.
Interestingly, there was a reporter on
lots of the time, Walter Lippmann.
Oh, you know,
so Walter loaded a Walter Lippmann.
So Walter Lippmann was a very interesting
journalist because he was
he was very inside.
He had a very close relationship
with Thomas Lamont at J.P.
Morgan.
Some people might have said back
then afterwards to close, okay,
that's not a
he then turned around, though actually,
after a lot of these things emerged
and sort of really went after them.
And so, I don't know, there's a, there was
but the other thing I should say,
we as a group, meaning the journal,
the journalists
did not cover ourselves in glory, in part
because a lot of these people
were being paid off
physically, like with cash.
I mean, talk about manipulation.
There were no insider trading laws.
Yeah. People were literally going up
to reporters,
forget about taking them as a dinner.
They were saying, you know, here's money
and please write an article saying
such and such stock is, you know, bound to
move higher tomorrow because
some rumor.
Okay, so another parallel.
Just keep going.
People talk about AI nowadays
and you see these charts of these sort of,
I always say
it's an incestuous relationship
between all the different
AI companies where so-and-so is buying
from this company,
and then they're lending to this company,
and it all kind of comes full circle
when you think about the 1929 crash,
a lot of it
was, you know, businesses issuing stock
in order to borrow money
in order to invest in more stocks.
Any similarities there? That sort of self.
I think it's very popular dealing.
Well,
if you think about these investment
trusts, there were so many investment
trusts, it turned into sort of leverage
upon leverage.
They were like Russian dolls of leverage,
and you didn't really even know what was
inside of them.
I think that's a little I
don't know if I can look at fully at the
AI companies like that just yet, though.
I think they're probably certain types
of deals and vendor financing sort of,
arrangements
that should be raising questions.
But you could look at the world of crypto,
actually, you could look at,
you know, strategy group.
Is it interesting?
I mean, is
strategy is like an investment trust.
That's actually what it is.
A lot of these trusts that are emerging,
that's what they are.
The question for the erstwhile
MicroStrategy, just for yes, for people
who haven't been paying attention
to the name.
Yeah, yeah.
Formerly MicroStrategy, Michael Saylor.
And, you know, I think there are
so there are these businesses that
that have similarities.
Again,
I don't want to tell you that strategy.
Sure is it is it is a 1929 style
investment trust per se.
I don't know,
can we talk about some other stuff?
What do you what's your.
You said in the intro?
Yeah. You're like,
have all these affiliations.
You're still doing dealbook all this other
stuff, like, dude, we grew up together.
We you're like, no, no, what is your
what is your, like, what are you.
Because you're still doing all of that.
I've like pared back a bunch of stuff.
I don't do TV anymore, etc..
Like, what is your, like day?
When I used to wake up with you
and I used to, but then I stuff.
And because I got tired and you didn't.
So what I want to know is like,
tell me about
what's a day like for you these days?
What are you up to?
So I wake up usually around 430 ish.
I usually do sort of the final pass
on some dealbook stuff
to call it 510 ish.
Do you just go straight to the computer?
Yes. Oh, straight. There's no there's no.
Yes. No. The alarm goes off, up up, up.
And then I do squawk box oftentimes still,
fixing things
until book up until the bitter end.
And that usually goes to about nine
often go on to morning Joe,
maybe talk a little economics there
and then get back into Dealbook land
as we plan out the next day's newsletter
and then in between all of that,
try to write this.
And, I have three kids and get involved
in other projects and things.
So it's it's a busy day
that doesn't typically end to,
you know, the end of the day.
What time do you go to bed?
I try to go to bed.
I try by 930.
If I if I can do it, that's really
if I can be in bed by 930, this can work.
Yeah.
If it gets to 10 or 10, 15
or any time after that,
there's going to be a rough day
the next day.
The next day is not a good day.
Okay.
Well,
one of the things you're known for is,
you know, you have a lot of access,
you know, a lot of people.
What are you hearing right now?
You don't have to name names, obviously,
but what are you hearing?
General opinions about the market
and maybe the influence of policy
from the Trump administration.
Oh, goodness. So
I don't know any CEO right now
that is particularly thrilled
with the Trump administration per se.
I think that most CEOs
I know are quite troubled
by things
that the Trump administration is doing.
You won't normally hear that,
with the exception of maybe Ken Griffin
or somebody like that who's
been somewhat public about some things,
but of course,
sort of modulated on others.
Having said that, I think they love
the idea of deregulation.
I think the folks in finance, by the way,
love the idea
of some of the things that Trump is doing,
even when it comes to things like,
you know, earnings reports.
You know, most CEOs I know
say I don't want to have to do earnings,
you know, four times a year.
I'll do that twice.
You have a whole movement afoot.
And by the way, this is
this to me is a parallel, you know, 1920s.
We talked about democratizing finance.
That was like a big concept.
Now, this whole idea
of democratizing finance
in the context of putting private credit
and private equity in venture capital
inside your retirement accounts in these
sort of semi liquid funds and things.
That's very 1929 ish to me. So
I do think there are people who like that,
but I think there's still this sort of
sort of underlying agita.
Can you talk actually a little bit more
about this shattered a nation part of it.
Like what does it mean?
I mean, there was a big downturn.
We all know about the Great Depression.
Did it threaten to rip apart the country
when it all ended?
Well?
So I think it ultimately did come close
to ripping apart the country.
But I think even,
maybe more
powerfully ripped apart
generationally a psyche.
So I don't tell the story in the book
because I didn't know
if it was appropriate.
But I'll tell it to you.
My grandfather was 11 years old.
He's no longer alive.
In 1929, he,
his brother was a messenger boy,
and he was down there in October of 1939.
He used to tell the story,
and he was helping his brother,
and he watched somebody
jump out of window,
and he lived till he was 91 years old.
And he never bought a share of stock
in his entire life.
Bought and bonds never stock.
And he would always say, Andrew,
this whole stock market thing.
Yeah. Not for us. Too risky.
And so I when I say shattered the nation,
I mean I think it did to
some degree come close
to shattering the psyche of a nation.
Did it did it
come close to a civil war? No.
Yeah. But clearly
the idea
of unemployment being 25% in America,
that there were shantytowns
otherwise known as Hoover Villas,
literally in Central Park,
you know, just a couple blocks from here.
And then,
you know, worse in so many other places,
I think for for a generation of people,
it felt like a shattered nation.
Yeah.
You don't really go
beyond the 1930s in the book,
but it does feel like
it took a very long time to rebuild,
I guess trust in the stock market.
We didn't really see retail like dive
in a lot until, I guess, the 1960s, 1960s.
Yeah, I think that's right.
I think that goes a little bit
to the sort of generational divide.
Look, the other piece of this is we,
you know, the book doesn't get
doesn't go into, you know, World War Two
and all the things that happened
after that.
But that's actually,
I think coming out of World War Two is
what ultimately led to sort of the
the boom again, to the extent
we had one in the US
and obviously the markets boom
and the reason why people,
I think, started to get back in the market
was because the market kept going up
and people started to look at the market
like they always do.
And when they think that the trend
is leaving the station
and they're not on the train,
they think, I get it.
I got to get on the train.
Totally back to something you said before.
It's interesting that these CEOs
don't really speak their mind
when the whole thing in January was like,
finally free speech.
We can talk again.
We can we can say
all the things that we've been hearing.
It's kind of messed up, isn't it?
Look, you think that there
should be real free speech taking place
and that people can raise their hand?
The liberal attitude towards speech.
But I think right now the view is,
what's the trade off?
I think there are people who
who don't who look at certain things
happening in Washington, say, I don't like
what's happening if I raise my hand now,
if I raise my hand today,
what is the upside for raising my hand?
And what is the downside
for raising my hand?
I think they look and say there's
very little upside, actually, because
the chance of a real change in this moment
right now is unlikely.
Maybe when we get to an election
or midterms or other things, I don't know.
And the chance of,
you know, on the downside is high.
I mean,
I think that between what we've seen,
the administration
to the law firms, to universities,
the whole Paramount CBS story
taking stakes in Intel and other things,
I mean, I think there's real implications.
If you're a business leader today
about how you approach your job,
you know, every business leader is
almost have to become a politician.
Yeah. All right.
This is a very,
journalistic classic cliche question.
I feel kind of bad, but you're another
journalist, so, you know, don't judge me.
Know if you could, I guess, take away
one lesson from the 1929 crash
and really emphasize it
to politicians, policymakers,
regulators, businesspeople, whoever.
What would it be?
Every financial
crisis is a function of one thing.
Is leverage in the system.
Too much leverage.
You actually can have speculators
and all the bad actors
you want, doing all the bad things
you can imagine on stage,
but it's the leverage that tips it over.
And as a result,
you need to have guardrails to prevent
that because the human condition
is to want more, right?
That's what the investor class it's
I hate to say
the idea of self-regulation is very,
very difficult.
People do not regulate themselves.
They just don't.
And so we just need to be super careful,
especially when there are all these
kind of new products
being developed and other things.
We don't know where the leverage is.
That to me would be the
the single biggest thing.
And my fear is we're living in a moment
right now actually,
where some of those guardrails
are almost purposely being taken away.
Well, we have four years between
for until the 100 year
anniversary of the 1929 crash.
Andrew Ross Sorkin so thrilled to finally
have you on the podcast.
The book is a great opportunity.
It's really great. I really appreciate it.
Really cool that you did this. I'm very,
everyone should be very impressed
and everyone should check it out.
It's great history and, I hope a
I hope it becomes a TV show.
Thank you, I hope, I hope I can come back
here in 2029, if you please.
For sure. And then 2030. Yeah.
All right. That was for.
Thank you I appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you so much. Tracy,
that was a lot of fun.
I love bubble history.
We used to do tons more episodes.
Oh, yeah.
They're always really fun.
Well, you know,
the Florida, land bubble gets mentioned.
Yeah, we did.
So a bunch of episodes on that, and,
now this is really cool.
I love all the pop culture elements,
the Winston Churchill, the Groucho Marx
astrologer. It's incredibly rich story.
It's an incredibly rich piece of history.
Yeah. And it is funny.
You can't avoid thinking
about the parallels. You really can't.
When am I getting my Japanese
exotic rabbit bubble episode?
Is there any time? Was that a bubble?
I didn't know about that one, apparently.
And sheep.
I want to do New England sheep too.
I want to do all the animal bubbles.
Let's do it.
Let's do them all.
All right, here's the bat.
The guano bubble.
We've never done an episode on it, but,
one thing.
The one other thing too, is I think, like,
you know, 2007, 2008,
the great financial crisis.
That was like a debt bubble, right?
There was a bunch of assets
that were expected to pay back
at a dollar on the dollar,
and they like, paid back at $0.90 an hour.
And the people panicked
and it was abandoned.
There's still a lot of credit tied to it.
There was a lot of
there was definitely the leverage.
The debt was being used as collateral.
The debt was being used as a collateral.
But it was, you know, that right now
we don't.
It just feels like it's a stock story.
It's a it's a, it's a things.
Everyone wants access to the right tail.
Yeah. Whatever.
And everyone wants the big score, etc..
And that was sort of 1929.
Reminds me of this idea.
Like different
than a sort of like housing bubble.
Just this idea like
everyone wants those right tail outcomes,
including Winston Churchill and
Roger Marx.
Well, you know, the chart
that the Dumas always tweet
is the margin debt chart, right?
And, you know, I have doubts about that
because the margin debt chart
goes up when stocks go up.
But it is at record highs.
So anyway, people
should definitely check out this book.
All right. Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
