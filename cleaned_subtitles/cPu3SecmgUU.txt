I'm curious how you explain what's happened like why in a year or a year and a half have you guys been uh you know made important contributions to your field it goes without saying luck obviously and I I feel like I've been very lucky in like the the timing of different progressions has has been just like really good in terms of advancing to the next level of growth um I feel like for the interpretability team specifically I joined when we were five people we've now grown quite a lot um but there were so many ideas floating around and we just needed to like really execute on them and have like quick feedback loops and like do careful experimentation um that led to like Signs of Life and have now allowed us to like really scale um and I feel like that's kind of been my biggest value add to the team um which it's not all engineering but but quite a lot of it has been interesting so you're saying like you came at a point where like they were there was had been a lot of science done and there was a lot of like good research leting around but they needed someone to like just take that like maniacally execute on it yeah yeah and and and there's this is why it's not all engineering because it's like running different experiments and like having a hunch for why it might not be working and then like opening up the model or opening up the weights and like what is it learning okay well let me try and do this instead and that sort of thing but um a lot of it has just been being able to do like very careful thorough but quick um investigation of different ideas I just don't get blocked very often like if I'm trying to write some code and like something isn't working even if it's like in another part of the code base I'll often just go in and fix that thing or at least hack it together to be able to get results and I've seen other people where they're just like help I can't and it's like no that's not a good enough excuse like go all the way down I've definitely heard like people in management type positions talk about the lack of such people where they'll check in on somebody a month after they give them a test a week after they give them a test I'm like how's it going and they say well you know we need to do this thing which requires lawyers because it requires talking about this regulation it's like how's that going I was like well we need lawyers and like why didn't you get lawyers I think that's arguably the most important quality in like almost anything it's just pursuing it to like the end of the Earth and like whatever you need to do to make it happen you'll make it happen if you do everything you win if you do everything you win exactly I think from my side uh definitely that quality has been important like agency in the work there are thousands I would even like probably tens of thousands of Engineers of Google who are like you know basically like we're all like equivalent like software engineering ability let's say like you know if you gave us like a very well- defined task um then we'd probably do it like equival wellbe a bunch of them would do it a lot better than me you know in all likelihood um but what I've been like one of the reasons that I've been impactful so far is I've been very good at picking extremely high leverage problems so problems that haven't been like particularly well solved so far um perhaps as a result of like frustrating structural factors like the ones that you pointed out in like that scenario before where they're like oh we can't do X cuz this team won't do y or like and then going okay well I'm just going to like vertically solve the entire thing we we should talk about uh how you guys got hired because I think that's a really interesting story so like the T the of this is I studied Robotics and undergrad and in the meantime on nights and weekends basically every night from 10: p.m. till 2: a.m. I would do uh my own like research and every weekend for like at least six to eight hours each day I would do my own research and coding projects and this kind of stuff that sort of Switched in part from like quite robotic specific work to after reading uh gw's scaling hypothesis post I got completely scaling pilled and was like okay like clearly the way that you solve robotics is by like scaling large multimodal models I was trying to work out how to scale that effectively and um James Bradbury uh who at the time was at Google and is now at anthropic um saw some of my questions online where I was trying to work out how to do this properly he was like I thought I knew all the people in the world who were like asking these questions who on Earth are you um and uh he you know he looked at that and he looked at some of like the robotic stuff that i' been putting up on my blog and that kind of thing and he reached out and said hey do you want to have a chat and you want to um like explore working with us here um and uh I was hired I as I understand it later as an experiment in trying to take someone with extremely high enthusiasm and agency and pairing them with some of the best Engineers that he knew um and so one another one of the reasons I could say like I've been impactful is I I had this like dedicated mentorship from utterly wonderful people what you mentioned about being um being bootstrapped immediately by these people might have meant that since you're getting up to speed on everything at the same time rather than spending grad school going deep on like one specific way of do RL you actually can take the global view and aren't like totally bought in on one thing so not only can is it something that's possible but like has greater returns than just hiring somebody out gratsu potentially you come at everything with fresh eyes um and come and locked to any particular field um now what like one caveat to that is that before like during my self- experimentation and stuff I was reading everything I could I was like obsessively reading papers every night um and like actually funnily enough I I like read much less widely now that I like my day is occupied by working on things um and in some respect I had like this very broad perspective before where not that many people even even like in a PhD program you like focus on a particular area um if you just like read all the NLP work and all the computer vision work and like all the robotics work you like see all these patterns just start to emerge across subfields um in a way that I guess like foreshadowed some of the the work that I would later do and Trenton does this map onto any of your experience I think sh's story is more more exciting um mine was just very serendipitous in that I I got into computational Neuroscience didn't have much business being there um my first paper was mapping the cerebellum to the attention operation and Transformers my next ones were looking at like you wrot that uh it was my first year of grad school okay um so 22 oh yeah but uh yeah my my next work was on uh sparsity in networks like inspired by sparcity in the brain uh which was when I met Tristan Hume uh and anthropic was doing the solu the softmax linear output unit work which was was very related in quite a few ways of like let's make the uh activation of neurons across a layer really sparse and if we do that then we can get some interpretability of what neuron's doing that started the conversation I shared drafts of that paper with Tristan he was excited about it and and then and and that was basically what led me to be become Tristan's resident and then convert to full-time um but during that period I also moved as a visiting researcher to Berkeley uh and started working with Bruno olous and Bruno Olen basically invented sparse coding back in 1997 and so it was like the the the my research agenda and the interpretability team seemed to just be running in parallel um in in with just research taste and and so it yeah it made a lot of sense for for me to work with the team um well and it's been a dream since one thing I've noticed when people tell stories about their careers or their successes they ascribe it way more to contingency but when they hear about other people's stories they're like of course it wasn't contingent you know what I mean it's like if that didn't happen something else would have happened yeah but I mean like I literally met Tristan at a conference and like wasn't didn't have a scheduled meeting I'm or anything just like joined a little group of people chatting and he happened to be standing there and I happened to mention what I was working on and that led to more conversations and I think I probably would have applied to anthropic at some point anyways but I would have waited at least another year I I I yeah I it's still crazy to me that I can like actually contribute to interpretability in a meaningful way I I think there's a important aspect of like shots on goal there so to speak right where like you even just going to choosing to go to conferences itself is like putting yourself in a position where you're where luck is more likely to happen my own was my own way of like trying to manufacture luck so to speak um and and like try and do something meaningful enough that it got noticed for the people who are like just assuming that the other end of the job board is like just like super legible and mechanical this is not how it works and in fact like people are looking for the sort of different way different kind of person who's agentic and putting stuff out there and I think specifically what people are looking for there is two things one is agency and like putting yourself out there uh and the second is the ability to do world class something yeah Andy Jones from anthropic did an amazing paper um on scaling laws as applied to board games it didn't require much resources it demonstrated incredible engineering skill it demonstrated incredible understanding of like the most topical problem of the time um and he didn't come from a like typical academic background or whatever as I understand it basically like as soon as he came out with that paper both ends R and open the eye were like we would desperately like to hire you there's this line the system is not your friend right uh and it's not necessarily to say it's it's actively against you it's your your sworn enemy um it's just not looking out for you right and so I think that's where a lot of the proactiveness comes in of like there are no adults in the room or like and and like you have to come to some decision for what you want your life to look like and execute on it and and yeah hopefully you can then update later um if you're two headstrong in the wrong way but but I think you almost have to just kind of charge at at certain things to to get much of anything done not be swept up in the tide of whatever the expectations are there's like one final thing I want to add which is like we talked a lot about agency and this kind of stuff but I think actually like surprisingly enough one of the most important things is just caring an unbelievable amount um and when you care an unbelievable amount you like you check all the details and you have like this understanding of like what could have gone wrong and you like you uh it just it matters more than you think because people end up not caring not caring enough uh this is like LeBron quote where he talks about how when he sort of before he started in the league he was like worried that everyone would be like incredibly good and and then he gets there and he like realizes that actually once people hit Financial stability then they um like they relax a bit and he's like oh this is going to be easy um and I don't think that's quite true because I think in like AI research because most people actually care quite deeply um but there's caring about your problem and there's also just caring about the entire stack and everything goes up and down like going explicitly going and fixing things that aren't your responsibility to fix because overall it makes like the stack better I something that a friend said to me a while back but I think is stuck is like it's amazing how quickly you can can become world class at something just because most people aren't trying that hard and like are only working like I don't know the actual like 20 hours that they're actually spending on this thing or something and so yeah if you just go ham then like you can you can get really far pretty fast
