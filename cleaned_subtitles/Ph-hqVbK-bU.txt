Hey everyone, it's Anna. All right, before we start the show, I want to talk about Valentine's Day because of course we are already thinking about it over here at Modern Love. We're hoping you can help us out. We want to know the most romantic thing that's ever happened to you. Or if it didn't happen to you, the most romantic thing you've ever seen or witnessed. It could be something grand, a romcom style gesture. Maybe someone stood outside your window with a boom box or ran through the airport to stop you from leaving. Or it could be something small like someone knows you hate olives, so they always pick them off your plate before you dig in. Or someone slips a note in your lunchbox every morning to remind you how much you mean to them. Whatever made you feel that rush of romance from the big moments to the tiny ones, we want to hear about it and we want to know why it was so romantic to you. If you have a story in mind, record a voice memo and email it to us at modernlove podcastny times.com by February 4th and we might use your story on the show. That's modern love podcasty times.com. And once again, your deadline is February 4th. Thanks so much. We can't wait to hear from you. Now, here's today's episode.
>> Love now and fall in love. Just tell I love her. Love was stronger than anything you [snorts]
>> for the love of love.
>> And I love you more than anything.
>> There's love.
>> From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. So, you might remember a while back we had the writer Sam Graham Felson on the show. He told us all about trying to rekindle his old friendships with other men in his life after he realized that as an adult he felt pretty lonely. That conversation was so full of tenderness and vulnerability and such a surprising reflection on masculinity that honestly I was a little surprised when I saw a new article from Sam pop up all about [music] trying to make his son tough. I was like tough? Tough? Really? That sounds so traditionally masculine. I didn't expect it coming from Sam and I really wanted to know what it meant to him. So today, Sam is back to tell us what happened when he took his 8-year-old son on a cross-country road trip to live [music] the strenuous life, why toughness felt like such an important thing for a son to learn, [music] and what his son taught him in return. Sam Graham Felson, welcome back to Modern Love.
>> It's really fun to be back. Sam, the last time we had you on the show, you'd written this big New York Times magazine story about friendship between men. Now, you've written another piece for the magazine. And just a note, your wife is an editor at the magazine. The story is called I Tried to Toughen Up My Son. Things didn't go as planned. There's a laughter. There's a lot [laughter] behind that laugh. We'll get into what happened, but first, I want to know why. Why did you think your son needed to be tough? So, my son really reminds me of what I was like as a kid. I was sensitive. I had passionate interests. I guess you could call that nerdy. [laughter] Um, unlike my son, I was so desperate to be cool that I forced myself to get good at basketball by spending a million hours, you know, shooting layups in my backyard.
>> My son has no interest in sports. In fact, he hates sports so much. Um, this is funny. The other day he like drew a picture of like a ray gun. And he was like, "This is called the sports gun. It's a special kind of like laser gun that that will shoot all the balls in the universe so I'll never have to play sports." [laughter]
>> Well, that is genius. The ray gun in this picture shoots the balls in the universe. They disappear. What does he want to do when the ray guns use? He wants to instead of at recess being pressured to play soccer or basketball or whatever, he wants to, you know, do his imaginary laring type games or whatever he does. But yeah, he wants to be in his world of imagination. He wants to, you know, turn over logs and see what insects are underneath them. I I mean, I remember when I took him to a birthday party. It happened to be at like this indoor basketball facility and the other kids were like sick at basketball and like my son had never played basketball so he's like you know uh if you're listening to this son I hope this doesn't embarrass you but he was like you know dribbling the wrong way down the court that kind of stuff like just didn't even know what was going on. And I realize it's like
>> you asked me about about toughness and now I'm just talking about sports. Um, and they are different. They are different things. And but but I think the way in which it's connected is it comes from the feeling that for boys, at least when I was a boy, right? If you're not good at sports,
>> it's kind of a wrap. Like you you you you're not going to be cool, you're not going to make friends. It's funny like when I think back,
>> I still remember the kid who got picked last. M it's not like like do I give a crap about like whether or not my son's going to like play college basketball or like like of course not. What I give a crap about is that like I just don't want him to be somebody who gets bullied or even made fun of or just excluded from the group.
>> And if he wants to do theater and nature stuff and whatever science stuff, he loves science, like great. But I then had the thought, I'm like, I want him to at least develop some toughness and resilience because if he gets picked on for being different, for not having the bro interest that all the other bros have, for being the kid at the birthday party that doesn't know how to play sports,
>> you can do that. But I think like the way to pull that off is like you have to have a really solid sense of confidence. You have to have a solid sense of like if someone tries to push me around like I'm going to stand up for myself and be like, "Yeah, I'm different and [ __ ] off." Like I enrolled him in a karate school
>> and when you're first starting out in karate,
>> it's basically like dance class. Like you're just doing like 20 different movements in a row. And so you're just practicing the movements, right? And once you get to orange belt, it's the first time where you have to do something scary, right?
>> Once you have orange belt, you have to buy all this new equipment. You get these pads, you get foot pads, you get all you get a helmet because you start fighting other kids, right?
>> Yeah.
>> But like he he couldn't do it. Like he was afraid of he was afraid of getting hit, but he was also afraid of hitting. And it just like it was misery for him. It was even worse than playing basketball in some ways. And he was just like, I'm not I'm not. And I and I really tried to encourage him. I'm like, listen, there's pads on. There's no way you're going to get hurt. There's no way you're going to hurt someone else. But like he just couldn't do it. So like after I dropped like hundreds of dollars on these pads, he dropped out like the [laughter] next day. But yeah.
>> Did he go to class? Like was there a were you at a class where they were sparring and he just couldn't do it or was it is there a memory you have of something like that?
>> Yeah. I mean, he wanted to quit right away and I and I kept I kept pushing him to go back, but he would just kind of stand there.
>> And the other kid like Yeah, there would be like another kid just like punching punching punching and he would just kind of stand there until the sensei was like, "All right, the other guy won." And I probably even like said from the sidelines, I be like, "Dude, you got to go on the offensive, too. You can't just stand there like getting hit. You do have that's the sport. You have to hit back.
>> You have to defend yourself sort of."
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. And then he would just do like a very tepid kind of like tap type thing and go back to just standing there frozen. Like he really didn't want to punch um or kick. You could also kick in karate. [laughter] He didn't want he didn't want to do either. And um
>> and I was just like, "All right, okay. Okay. You don't have to you don't have to do this stuff." One thing I want to get into a little more specifically here is something you're bringing up which I I think is interesting which is the sort of interplay between toughness and violence, right? Like because in this karate, you know, situation, you're not only encouraging him to hit back, you want him to protect himself. Why did you feel like or did you feel like your son needed to be able to fight or was it not about fighting?
>> So this is like the central question for me is like, can you instill a sense of resilience and toughness and self-confidence and even maybe swagger in a boy
>> and be against violence, right? Be totally against violence, right? And so the question I had is like I also abhore violence
>> and yet like if you teach your kids martial arts it's not just learning how to block.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Look all like I have to say like I still don't know how I feel about this question of violence.
>> I still don't have the answers. But what I was trying to figure out like as I dug deeper inside of myself is like what is your actual position on violence visav raising a son? Do you actually think that it is the right thing to do to tell him that he has to be willing to punch someone in the face and break their nose and cause blood to stream out of their nostrils if it comes to it? Or do you actually think that is never worth it? that it's never okay to harm another human being and what are the ramifications for either of those choices. Right?
>> If he is the punch the guy in the nose and break his nose and watch the bloodstream out of his nostrils guy, there are some serious consequences to that. And if he is the turn the other cheek guy or the runaway guy, which is what I was like as a kid, there's also some serious consequences to that.
>> You were the turn the other cheek kid growing up.
>> Yeah.
>> Paint me a picture of that. What did that look like for you, young Sam?
>> When I was younger, like, and maybe I'm being too hard on myself in [clears throat] my memories, but when I was younger, I feel like when there were inflection points for me, like when there was a scary thing, I would run away or I would um just avoid the situation or I would quit.
>> The moments that fill me with the greatest shame. And I don't have a lot of shame in my life, but [snorts] I do have shame about certain moments from my childhood. Like I remember there were these kids, some of them were in this like gang, quote unquote, maybe it was a gang, maybe they just called it that. I mean, these are like 13-year-old kids, right?
>> I think the group was called the JP Dog Pound. That was their that was their nickname. But me and my and my buddies, actually, Rob, who
>> Oh my god, Rob features heavily in your our previous conversation. Yeah, for those who listen to the last five, you know, I I wrote the the essay that I wrote, a lot of it was about my my my best friend from childhood, Rob, and uh we were playing basketball with them and one of the kids from the dog pound kept calling foul on like [ __ ] things like when no one was fouling him. Like he basically he was cheating, right? He kept being like foul, foul, foul, like
>> so that he could get the ball back and get an advantage. And Rob just called him out at one point. He's like, "Bro, that's [ __ ] Like no one's fouling you." And the kid got like really riled up by that
>> and he grabbed Rob and like kind of throttled him and like pressed him up against this chain link fence
>> and he was basically was like I'm going to beat the [ __ ] out of you. And I I didn't run away but I remember like I just stood there frozen like and and the kid didn't end up beating up Rob, but like he held him up against this fence throttling him. It was like a scary moment
>> and I just like didn't
>> didn't do anything to try to defend him and step up and like and help him and and he felt abandoned in that moment
>> and justifiably he gave me a hard time about it. But like that is like one of the moments where I look back on my childhood and I'm like
>> I my fear of violence in that moment led to me doing the wrong thing for my friend. like I abandoned my friend because I was afraid of violence.
>> And there were other incidents where
>> like look, I grew up in the city. I mean, I I don't know what it's like nowadays,
>> but like there were a lot of fights. There were like a lot of fights. There were fights at the bus stop. There were fights like in the schoolyard. And there were like group fights at parties where like people got badly hurt.
>> Yeah.
>> And I just never participated in them. I would always find a way to like slink off somewhere and just like make myself scarce when when a fight broke out. And my friends all all knew it and gave me a hard time about it and called me all kinds of epithets.
>> What would they call you?
>> [ __ ]
>> Mhm.
>> Gay.
>> Wow. Yeah. [ __ ] [ __ ] Probably. [ __ ] probably more than anything else. And when you were walking home from the basketball court or the party or whatever where you didn't get involved in a fight, you didn't stand up, you didn't do it, what were what thoughts were you thinking about yourself?
>> My thought was Sam Graham Felson is a little [ __ ]
>> Wow.
>> You're a [ __ ] You're a [ __ ] You're a bit like
>> my I was beating the [ __ ] out of myself internally. I felt like a piece of [ __ ] I felt really like there was this phrase in Teddy Roosevelt's autobiography that really struck me where after he had been mugged as a boy, he said, "I felt like a predestined victim." And I just I really related to that. I felt like I was a predestined victim. Like no matter what the situation was, I was a [ __ ] right? I was not going to be the guy who stood up. And I'll tell you like this is why like I cared about thinking through this stuff in raising my own son because I felt really bad about this stuff growing up and it affected other areas of my life.
>> How Yeah.
>> I was afraid to um dance on a dance floor
>> with girls or just even dance in general. in general, but especially with girls, I was afraid of girls. And like um not not only was I terrified of asking a girl out, but I was afraid to say yes when a girl asked me out
>> because I think on some level I was just like,
>> well, I I'm a [ __ ] So like a [ __ ] can't have a girlfriend. Like a you know, only like a only like a man can, you know, like someone who's like really secure in their masculinity can have a girlfriend. Like and probably on some unconscious level I'm thinking like am I even going to know how to like kiss a girl? Am I going to know how to do all this [ __ ] But it all comes from the idea of like being a physical coward. And you know if I'm physically afraid to fight, maybe I'm physically afraid to dance. Maybe I'm physically afraid to kiss too. Like it had all these different effects on the way that I saw myself. But I'll say like it extended even beyond that. Like I was not a good student as a kid. I was in danger of flunking out of my high school because I didn't have the confidence to learn. Like I thought I thought I'm like a loser basically or I'm like a victim. I'm I'm a coward. So like when something was hard for me like math for example, I was just like I'm not going to be able to get it.
>> And this is all because you felt weak or because you couldn't fight. All of those things came from
>> Yeah. that core.
>> I mean, if there was like a professional therapist in the room, they might say, "Well, it was really about all these other things." And and of course, it always it is about Yeah, it's about a million other things, too. But I think that
>> the core thing was that I had low self-confidence. And now as an adult who's really into fitness and really into like self-improvement in lots of other ways, the kind of cornerstone of like how I live my life is that like you actually can get better at pretty much anything, but you have to deal with like doing some painful practice and sucking at it at first and then being okay with that and and continuing to go and like not giving up. And so my whole life is built around like strategies for not giving up and and and believing like having this faith that practice makes you better.
>> As a kid, I just didn't I didn't have that. And again, like is it all because I was afraid to fight?
>> No. But there was something fundamental about the idea that on the most elemental level
>> when it really came down to it on the streets, in the schoolyard, on the basketball court, I was not going to rise up
>> and protect myself.
>> And all of these memories that are clearly so vivid to you from your childhood are present with you as you're raising your son. And so to me, like knowing this backstory puts such a different veilance on, you know, the scene of you watching your son get punched in karate class, right? It's not just about him getting punched or him not defending himself. I mean, you tell me, but you're probably thinking of yourself in that moment. You're thinking of him. I mean, there's all these there's all of this stuff that's being brought up by by raising a son.
>> And I remember like I have a daughter, too, but my son is me and my wife's first kid. And I remember like when we saw the sonogram image and realized we were having a boy, I immediately, you know, I was very moved by the idea of like the challenge of what it's going to be like to raise a son. I immediately thought like the minute I saw that sonogram image, I thought the challenge of my life as a father is going to be how to raise a boy who becomes a man who is a good person who feels good about himself. And having someone who feels good about himself, I think, increases the likelihood that he will be the kind of person who can take care of other people and respect other people and radiate goodness and kindness.
>> And once I started to see my son's personality come out, when you know, like kids when they're before they're two, they don't really have a personality. They're just like blobs of blubber basically. But like they when when once he started to have a personality, I'm like, "All right, this kid is a chip off the old block." like he's really like me in a lot of ways. And my daughter, by the way, not not like that. Like she doesn't walk around afraid of a lot of stuff, but he does. And I said, "All right, you know that he's really like me in a lot of ways." And I want to help him get to the place where I am now a lot faster than I got to it.
>> We'll be right back. So, what was your plan to, you know, train's the wrong word. Let's just say your plan to sort of toughen up your son to teach him resilience.
>> So, it wasn't totally premeditated. It was a little bit premeditated. Um, I'll start by saying my son has always had an obsessive personality. His current obsession, which has been an obsession for like a year and a half, is national parks. He loves national parks. And as he got more interested in the national parks, he started doing more of his own research and really fell in love with Teddy Roosevelt, who
>> I hadn't really known this, but Teddy Roosevelt is kind of seen as the godfather of the national parks because he didn't found the national parks as an idea, but he he like basically expanded them like crazy.
>> So my son got more and more interested in Teddy Roosevelt.
>> And how old is he at this time right now?
>> Eight.
>> Eight. Okay.
>> And and I said, "You know what? like now that you're getting so into this, let's spend a whole week. I'll let you pick any park. And he was like, I want to go to the Badlands. I want to go to Teddy Roosevelt National Park in the Badlands.
>> And where is that? In the
>> That's in North Dakota. And I was like, great. And then like very quickly clicked for me. I'm like, first of all, the Bad Lands, like I'd never been to the Badlands. I'd always dreamed of going to the Badlands. It's it's a badass place. It's like Sounds like it.
>> It's the Wild West. It is the Wild West. It's like it's in the middle of nowhere. There's nothing nearby. Like you have to drive for a while to get out there. It's the frontier. It's a hard land filled with
>> rocks basically. And it's a it's a place where this is where Teddy Roosevelt actually went when he was in his 20s to
>> I mean it's like masculinity kind of embodied, right? There's like rocks and bison and like sheer faces of big drops.
>> It is exactly that. It's like it's like I mean it's what you think of as the Wild West. And so, like, you know, there was something like kind of amusing to me about like going to this iconic macho place with my son. But what really started to get my wheels turning was reading about Teddy Roosevelt and what happened to him out there and knowing that like Teddy Roosevelt, like me, like my son, was actually a huge nerd as a little kid
>> and a hugely fearful little kid. Teddy Roosevelt got his ass beat as a little kid. He was so scared to leave his house that he needed his little brother to walk around with him for protection, right? So Teddy Roosevelt now, like we think of him as like the iconic man, right? Like the guy with the big mustache and like the hunter's rifle and like
>> all the like trophies of animals on his wall and like if you listen to any of these bro podcasts, people quote Teddy Roosevelt all the time. He's LeBron James writes a Teddy Roosevelt quote on his shoes before basketball games every night.
>> Everything comes back to basketball games.
>> It really does. [laughter] Yeah. So once I like started thinking about all this, I'm like I just got kind of tickled by the idea of like this is going to be a real full weekend to weekend 9-day road trip, a father-son road trip, right?
>> And I was thinking like let's do this. It's like let's have a road trip where I get to explore what it means to be like a man with my son in a place that was this iconic, you know, site of of masculinity and an iconic formative location for my son's hero Teddy Roosevelt. So, it just felt like
>> all the ingredients. I mean, it really is. It's like the austere landscape, the harshness of the physical tasks to to navigate that landscape. when you finally get to the park itself, what are you hoping will happen? What is your like dream outcome for this trip with your son?
>> So, like I had some early fantasy of like, oh, let's live like Teddy Roosevelt did. Like, let's go find some like dude ranch and like ride around on horses and like get dirty and like do the tough things that Teddy Roosevelt had to do on the land. Then I realized that that would not be a very fun vacation for my son. I'm like, I'm not going to force him to do that. Um, I don't think it would have been fun for me either.
>> Really what I what I wanted to do was like he is eight at this point and I'm like he's old enough to start going on real hikes. Like before it was like a hike would be like
>> a walk around a a pond that took like 15 minutes, right? So a lot of it was just I want to push him to do harder hikes than he's ever done and see if he can deal because it's not
>> because that's the discomfort. That's the resilience. So, let's go on this hike that is pushing it a little. It sounds like for I mean eight's kind of young to be going on a
>> I don't know how how you know
>> the first hike that I tried to do with him was 3 miles which is a fair amount which is a fair amount. Yeah. So, tell me how that went. Did you tell him how long it was going to be?
>> Not really. I pulled the like trick that my dad used to pull on me being like, "Oh, it'll be fine. It's like you know." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That kind of thing. So, you set out
>> and within minutes he's like, "I'm hungry. Let's go back to the visitor center and get another snack."
>> And like, "Dumb dad, I like forgot to bring a snack." But I'm like, "I'll buy you a double snack back at the visitor center if you do the hike." Um, I'm trying like every bribe in the boat. I'll buy you an ice cream sundae if you do the hike. And he's just complaining and he doesn't want to do the hike. And then he's also scared because there are wild bison
>> in this park and bison are like aggressive animals and they can charge at 35 miles an hour and my son is a big nature nerd so he knew the fact that they could charge 35 miles an hour and like we were hearing rustling in the bushes and we had not seen a bison yet and I was like I really really really want to see a bison. So when we heard the rustling in the bushes I'm like let's go check it out. And at that point he like grabs my hand. He's like dad what are you doing? you're scaring me. Like, get over here. And he like really squeezed my hand and I was like, "All right, I'm I'm overdoing this." Like, well, I want to say that I was being really subtle, but the truth is at times I was not being very subtle. Like, I was saying things to him like we were reading a kids biography. Like, if you go to like Barnes & Noble, there's like a whole section called like who is it's like who is Abraham Lincoln? So, there are these little kid biographies with like cartoon pictures in them and stuff. So we were reading who is Teddy Roosevelt
>> and there's this famous quote from Teddy Roosevelt where he talks about like living the strenuous life. Yes.
>> So I kept saying to him like come on let's live the strenuous life. Let's live the strenuous life. Like you got this. Like I know it's a little bit of a long hike but you got this. You're going to feel really good when you're done. And then finally he just kept complaining. I'm like all right let's call it a day. Like it's the first day.
>> He's not into this hiking stuff and I'm not going to push it too hard on the first day. But then interestingly the next day he like totally surprised me. We drove to another part of the park like a much more rugged part of the park
>> and he was like let's go off trail
>> and you were like
>> strenuous life.
>> Yeah. I was like okay. And then [clears throat] he got really into the idea of like climbing up they're called butes. These are like uh
>> like try to picture like the Grand Canyon but like upside down where [laughter] huge rock formations.
>> Yeah. these beautiful like layered like multicolored rock formations that are like plateaus and he was like let's go climb that but then like he climbed this but I'm following after him and he he insisted in being in in the front he wanted to be the trailblazer he's like I want to be the trailblazer and then I'm thinking like all right we're getting really far away from the beaten
>> path what what do you think changed from one day to another to make him be like dad you're scaring me to now this day running ahead on the but being the trailblazer what do you think it was
>> so we did read Every night we were reading parts of the Teddy Roosevelt book and we did read a part
>> about when Teddy Roosevelt got beat up as as a kid. Whoa.
>> And so we talked about like
>> that Teddy Roosevelt was not brave as a kid and he was not strong as a kid. And you know, again, I'm trying at this point to like be a little bit more subtle, but I'm basically saying to him like Teddy Roosevelt changed. He was not naturally
>> tough. Like he made himself tougher. And I did the same thing myself. And I think he was probably inspired by that idea more by Teddy Roosevelt than by me. But like it did surprise me though. I started saying to him, I'm like, you know, we are getting really far away from the trail.
>> Running on the on the be.
>> Yeah. And he he kept finding another that was even higher than the last but like going higher and higher and higher and kind of like scrambling on these rocks. And at one point, like not only are we far from the trail, but we're on this narrow ridge and
>> Oh, you're gonna scare me again. Okay. Yeah.
>> And and by the way, the weather in North Dakota is famously mercurial and it changes on a dime and it is one of the big places for tornadoes and just in general, like crazy weather just comes out of nowhere out there. So, the sky started to change and like the wind started to pick up and I'm like, we got to go back down. like we could get literally get blown off of the but like there's no one out here to help us cuz we are way off the beaten path at this point and I'm starting to get scared but he wasn't scared and he was like he actually turned to me and he's like come on we're living the strenuous life like like come on come come on dad so I let him go for a little while longer
>> you proud
>> yeah definitely
>> you were scared and proud and these things were happening at the same time
>> and then by the way on the way down um this is like a good lesson for why it is actually important to stay on a path rather than to like just go trailblazing. It was really steep on the way down and I slipped at one point and like kind of badly cut up my leg on on the gravel, but I slipped and like slid down part of the but and like he was ahead of me and I actually like slid into him and I was worried that not only was my leg bleeding but I was worried that like I had hurt him cuz I hit him kind of hard and normally he freaks out at the sight of blood like me. He hates shots like every time it's flu season. He's like if there's not flu missed I'm not doing it. I'm not getting a flu shot. [laughter] So I'm like, "Oh god, now he's going to freak out at the blood." And and he was just like, "You're good. You're okay. You're okay. You're you're going to be fine." So I'm thinking like at that moment, I'm like, "This is happening way faster than I was expecting." I'm like I'm like, "This guy like is changing so quickly. Like this is incredible."
>> You're like, "I did it. Mission accomplished."
>> I really like was thinking to myself as as I'm like limping down the mountain, I'm like, "This is really working out according to plan. This is incredible." [laughter] And of course, like, you know, kids change on a dime. So like things things took an interesting turn after that on the trip which we can get into when you want to but but it wasn't like this steady ascent of like braver and braver and more strenuous life and you know where he emerged from the badlands like a macho man.
>> There were some big curve balls. [music]
>> We'll be right back.
>> [music] [music]
>> Heat. Heat. N. [music]
>> [music] [music] [music]
>> If the story were to end here, the title of your piece would be different because right now it's it's I tried to tough myself up. Things did not go according to plan. But if you just ended with him, you know, scrambling down the but being like, "Come on, Dad. Catch up." It would be I tried to stuff up my son in the Badlands and it worked. So what was the
>> It would have been How I Made My Son a Badlands Badass by Sam.
>> And by the way, I'd click on that, too. But what but what So what happened? So what next?
>> Well, first of all, there were things that were happening on the trip that were complicated. There were lots of things that we were seeing and hearing
>> that prompted difficult conversations that I guess I was like a little bit prepared to talk about but hadn't really fully thought through
>> what I was going to say to him about some of these topics. So, I'll give I'll give a few examples like um
>> there's a lot of native people in North Dakota
>> and actually a lot of these national park sites are on holy native sites
>> which is not cool, right? And like Mount Rushmore is on like a holy mountain and we just carved some faces into it. Like that wasn't cool. So like my son is seeing this and like starting to realize that like the thing that he loves more than anything else in the world, national parks has this kind of problematic
>> there's like a flip side to that coin which is that like a lot of these places that we see as like this beautiful idea of a public space for all were in fact someone else's land that got taken away. So I'm like explaining that stuff to him.
>> Yeah. We actually drove through the site of the most infamous massacre in the history of the genocide of Native American people.
>> Yeah.
>> Which was at Wounded Knee.
>> So that's in South Dakota. And it's a place where like over a hundred Native Americans were just shot at point blank by US soldiers.
>> So he starts asking more and more questions. Like he says to me, he's like, "Dad, like did the Native Americans like do anything to deserve this? M
>> I'm like, "No, they didn't actually. They didn't do anything to deserve this."
>> Yeah.
>> You know, um that was a hard conversation just to be like, "Yeah, a very bad thing was done to these people and there's no way about it. There's no like way of excusing it." And by the way, your hero Teddy Roosevelt wasn't exactly great on this stuff either,
>> right? And he starts to ask questions like,
>> he says to me at one point, he's like, "Dad, was Teddy Roosevelt a bad guy or a good guy?" M
>> and I'm like and I paused for a long time and I'm like man uh what am I, you know, what do I say here? Teddy Roosevelt was a massive imperialist. Teddy Roosevelt believed that non-white people were inferior and like that it was kind of all right to go take their [ __ ] Teddy Roosevelt loved violence. That's the dark side of Teddy Roosevelt, the masculine guy. And like, you know, I sometimes think like what if Teddy Roosevelt hadn't been mugged as a little boy, right? Teddy Roosevelt had planned to become a scientist, like he was going to be a naturalist. Like he had planned to his ambition was to like
>> go around collecting like moss samples and like salamanders and like looking at them and putting them in museums.
>> Mighty have just turned out like that instead of like an imperialist. So, if Teddy's falling, is anyone rising in the ranks for your son in terms of
>> Yes. So,
>> role models to be obsessed with.
>> So, um we did a lot of driving on this trip and he's he's doing a lot of hiking and I'm proud of him for having a really good attitude
>> and he's getting through the hikes.
>> Yeah, he's he's getting he's getting through the hikes better and he's he's just he is doing a lot better
>> and and I'm proud of him for that and I'm starting to be like, "All right, you can have your iPad time." Yeah. and he had watched he probably watched Home Alone for the 900th time because he's obsessed with Home Alone. And I'm like, you know what? Let's download a new movie. I just saw that Peewee's Big Adventure is available and uh that was one of my favorite childhood movies. So, basically, I pulled over like load this movie up for him and then like we start driving and then I just start hearing him cracking up in the back seat and he's just like I've never heard him laugh so much and he's like, "Dad." He's like, "Oh my god." And he keeps rewinding this one scene where um this bully, this arch nemesis of Peewee's named Francis has stolen Peewee's bike and and Peewee gets revenge on him by like asking him if he wants a piece of gum. And he gives a piece of gum to Francis. And Francis is like, "Oh, that's so sweet of you, Peewee. Thank you so much." And Francis chews it and turns out to be trick gum. And like this black ooze like comes like out of his mouth gum. He's like horrified. And uh and my son thinks it's like the funniest thing ever. He's like, "Oh my god, Trick Gum, that's amazing." And he just fell in love with like a lot of what a lot of what happens in this movie is like Peewee, who is a really wimpy guy.
>> Mhm.
>> Definitely the opposite of Teddy Roosevelt energy, like he kind of gets by on his wits and he gets by with like little tricks and he gets by like not by punching people in the face, but by giving people like trick gum and stuff like that.
>> And my son just really really really vibed with it. And um like later on when we're hiking again like he just starts like asking he's like dad like can you buy trick gum anywhere? And I was like you know when I was a kid I had trick gum. He's like wait you had trick gum? That's incredible. He's like tell me. I was like yeah it was just like that. Like when you chewed it made this black ink ooze out of your mouth. He's like how long was your tongue black for? I was like [laughter] probably like 2 hours your tongue was black. He's like oh my god who did you trick with the trick gum? I was like I think I tricked my little brother with it. He's like, "Oh my god, you tricked Uncle Joe with the trick." So then, [laughter] so then then he's like, "Um, did you have any other tricks?" I'm like, "Yeah, I had this hand buzzer where like you could pretend to you were being friendly and shaking someone's hand."
>> Yeah.
>> But then they would shake your hand and and it would buzz them like like
>> totally
>> like it felt like a shock and they get really scared. And I had this other thing where they open a can of popcorn and like this crazy snake thing pops out. He's like, "Oh my god." And he's like his mind is blown by this. He's like,
>> "I'm not kidding. This conversation lasted for like an hour where I told him about all the tricks that I had as a kid.
>> Yeah.
>> And for the rest of the trip, like he must have rewatched Pee-Wee's Great Adventure six or seven times on this trip. And he started like going on when I would like turn my back or go to the bathroom, he'd like get on my computer and go on Amazon. He would like look up Pee-Wee Herman outfits and like wanted to buy like a a red bow tie and and like he's getting really really into it. And I will just [clears throat] note even though it's it's pretty obvious if you know these two men or you can see them in their in your mind's eye like Peewee is very very not the rugged wild west archetype we've been talking about. He's sort of I would say kind of genderless. He's witty. He's wily. He's weird. He's like very authentic but he's he's strange. He's doing his own thing.
>> And it's interesting. I mean like he's not
>> he's not tough.
>> He's not tough, but like Yeah. He's he has a kind of high-pitched voice. He he walks around in kind of like a
>> almost like balletic way.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> But he's a man. He's a grown man.
>> And I don't My son is not looking at Peewee being like,
>> "Well, he's not a man."
>> Yeah.
>> He's just like, "Yeah, that's a different kind of
>> He's like, I want a bow tie for myself."
>> Yeah. He is clearly like moving in the direction of like he's got a new hero and it's not Teddy Roosevelt, it's Peewee Herman. And mostly I'm tickled and even moved by this because like I was a big comedy nerd as a kid. I love Peewee. That's why I showed him the movie.
>> Like my bigger hero was weird Al Yankovic. Like comedy I still love comedy. Like I every every my wife and I can never agree on a movie because I always want to watch a dumb [laughter] comedy and like like
>> but you're feeling connected to your son in this in his obsession. But at the same time, can I just ask like him becoming obsessed with
>> with Peewee?
>> Yeah.
>> Were you worried about that? Like if you started to emulate someone who is different in these ways like Peewee is, were you worried? I mean, to bring it back to the beginning of our conversation, just straight up, were you worried he'd get beat up if he started wearing the bow tie?
>> Huh?
>> Yes. And and here's the thing, right? In the movie, which I again, I highly recommend people watch. It's a great movie, but in the movie,
>> it's a beautiful fantasy because Peewee doesn't really get bullied. M
>> there is one jerk named Francis who steals his bike,
>> but like there are these bros in his in his little fictional town who are these alpha mountain biker bros and like they give him high fives. He gets respect. He's not a loser and he's not a geek and he's not a wimp and he's not a [ __ ] Like he's just he's peewee. Everyone loves peeweee, right?
>> He's completely himself. He dresses in weird outfits. At one point in the movie, he puts on these high heeled boots in front of a biker gang
>> and he does a crazy dance, but the biker gang loves it. And they're like, "You're the man. We love you, man." Like like like and and and so he spellbinds everybody with his charisma.
>> And the charisma is born of an absolute belief in himself as as an idiosyncratic powerhouse individual and just like he's like a diva. He just is who he is proudly, totally individually, and idiosyncratically
>> and he gets respect from the world for that. And what was sad for me watching that, especially seeing my son starting to idolize Peewee Herman, is thinking like, well, wouldn't that be amazing if my son could be like a total idiosyncratic weirdo and proud of it and dress however he wants to dress and not play sports and instead do weird dances and wear what, you know,
>> but like in the real world, wouldn't Peeweee get his ass beat? In the real world, wouldn't wouldn't people be calling pee-wee nasty homophobic words? And in fact, like my son doesn't know this, but in the real world, Peewee did get [ __ ] over by homophobic culture and had his life ruined by it.
>> Yeah.
>> Right. And of course, like my son doesn't know all of that.
>> Of course not.
>> But I am thinking like, okay, I'm willing to like let him go all in on this. And by the way, he he literally like if he if it was up to him, he would wear a suit to school with a bow tie every day. I have told him like he can do it sometimes. like he's got to wear regular hoodie and jeans most of the time.
>> Oh my god.
>> But like he does dress like Peewee.
>> But you're watching him become obsessed with with this movie with Pee-Wee
>> and you're telling me like you're you're looking at this and and you think it's wonderful and you also are like this is not the real world. And if you were to truly wear your suit and your bow tie to school every day, you might get picked on, beat up. There's this scene that you have in your piece where you can kind of sense you grappling with like wanting to encourage this authentic part of your son, but also trying to remind him of the kind of real world dynamics that you want to have him protect himself from. Can you explain and and you do it via like a bit of role playing actually. Can you explain what happened towards the end of the trip?
>> So on the last night of the trip, we had this road trip. A lot of stuff happened. He clearly moved from getting really excited about the strenuous life to getting more excited about the pee-wee life, which is fine. And you know, [laughter] like like I
>> classic,
>> he's and and he also showed me on this trip in a lot of ways
>> that he may not be as physically brave as other kids, but he's very emotionally brave. He's the kind of kid
>> who will point out the thing about Teddy Roosevelt. Yeah.
>> And by the way, also we'll talk about his own feelings very openly in a way that like I can I mean unless I'm on a podcast with you, I can never talk about my feelings, but basically like yeah, he'll say things like I'm feeling sad because I'm feeling lonely like because of this or that. Like he'll he'll actually articulate those things out loud.
>> But anyway, like it's the end of the trip. He's turning in that pee-wee direction. [clears throat] And I am thinking in the back of my head like look, I'm a creative professional. Like I want him to be unique. The last thing I want to do is have a normie as a son, right? Like I love the idea if he's if he's the idiosyncratic. Like I don't want to raise a conformist. I love the fact that he's different. And he even says to me, he's like he knows that he's different. He says, "Dad, I'm different. I'm not like the other kids." And I love that. I don't want him to be like the other kids. I really don't. But I also don't want him to get his ass beat at some point. And and and so like I'm thinking so much for the strenuous life. He's already moved on from that.
>> Y
>> So we're it's the final end of the Airbnb. Like we packed everything up. I'm I'm tucking him into bed and I'm like but I just have this feeling. I'm like all right well I want to like have a more direct conversation with him about bullying because I'm still worried that like he might get bullied at some point.
>> And you know I'm thinking to myself if he's really going to go in this direction like
>> and it's not like he's never been picked on. and he has been picked on. Nothing severe, but like
>> he's still pretty young. And I'm thinking like he's about to go into fourth grade. Like it was the summer. It was last summer. He's about to go he's now in fourth grade. I'm like fourth grade was when I remember real bullying started to begin,
>> you know, and soon he'll be in middle school. So I'm like, "All right, I can't quite give up on my mission to toughen him up." M.
>> So, I say like, "All right, I want to do like a role playing thing where I'm going to pretend to be a bully and I want you to like basically stand up for yourself and um and stand up to me." So, just pretend I'm a bully and you be you and I'll be the bully.
>> What did he say to that? [laughter]
>> So, he was like, "Uh, that's kind of weird." And I'm like, "Just go with it, man." All right. So, I come up to him. I'm like, uh, he has this idea that he wants to start a technology company, including, you know, making a ray gun that will totally
>> destroy all the sports balls. So, like he he wants to build a time machine. Like, he has all the he wants to build a machine that will replicate money so that he can be both the richest man in the world and give money to all the poor people in the world.
>> It seems like a very exciting company.
>> So, so his company is called Clementine. Shout out to Clementine. and he's got his own logo that he draws of like an Apple logo but with a Clementine. So anyway, so I come up to him. I'm like, "Bro, like, hey man, Clementine sucks. Clementine is never going to succeed as a company and like you're a loser." I'm like going a little far, but like I wanted to create a realistic bully scenario. I'm like, like Clementine's a failure and you're dumb and you're a loser.
>> And then he's like, "That's not true. Clementine's a good company." And I'm like, that's how you're going to respond? And I'm like, but so then I'm like doubling down. I'm like, you're a coward. Like, I'm going to beat you up. You're you're a loser. You know, like no one likes, you know.
>> Can I pause you for a second? Were you speaking from a place of where was these words coming from? What were you drawing on to be this bully?
>> Uh the things people said to me.
>> Okay. That's what I thought.
>> So, yeah. So, I'm not saying the word [ __ ] in front of him. But I'm like, you're like, when I told my wife that I role played and even used the word loser, she's like, "That's a little harsh." I'm like, "Yeah, I guess it was." But I was trying to prove a point. Kids talk to each other in really nasty ways.
>> So, I'm like, "You're a loser.
>> Nobody likes you." Like, basically like you're different in a bad way.
>> And then he's really like, "No, I'm not. Like, I'm good." You know? And I'm like, "Keep trying." And I'm finally I'm like, "All right." Like at one point I like gave him a fake shove. And then he like,
>> "Was that uncomfortable for you to like even just play act being a bully to your own son?" I mean, it must have been hard.
>> It didn't feel good to do that. And you know, [clears throat]
>> I don't I'm I don't recommend this to like listeners at home. I don't think this is like a great parenting moment or whatever. It was like it was an experiment.
>> Yeah.
>> And then at one point like he hit me but in this like really soft way where where like he didn't punch me with a fist. He just kind of like tapped
>> because you shoved him and then he hit you back.
>> And I didn't really shove him. a fake sh but but he like taps me and I'm like all right this is like a very stupid activity and I'm going to call it quits and like this was uh you know a fail
>> and uh not a like good parenting moment but I tried it. It was a failed experiment.
>> Yeah.
>> And like as I'm like moving on he's like oh wait wait wait wait I I I thought of a good I thought of a good way to to fight back against the bully be a bully again dad. Be a bully again. So I'm like all right fine. I'm like hey you're a loser. Nobody likes you. your company's going to fail. And um and he goes um well, you know, I'm glad you feel that way. It's I'd rather be friends with you than fight you. Can I offer you a piece of gum? And I'm like, really? That that's that's nice. I wasn't expecting that, but like sure, yeah, I I'll have some gum. And uh so he like hands me like a pretend piece of gum and I like pretend to unwrap it and I put it in my mouth and I start chewing and then he's like I have news for you. It's trick gum. [laughter]
>> Oh my god, it's Pi's trick gum.
>> AND THEN I'M LIKE NO. I'm like [laughter] I can't believe it's Trick Gum. And then I like you know pretend but again like when he said that I was just like that I played I role played for a little while of like pretending you know black goose was coming out of my mouth and like fell on the floor and I'm like oh my god and then afterwards I was just like that was a really like you got me man that was it like you did it. You did it. You got the bully. That was it. [laughter]
>> I mean it's it's
>> I was not expecting that at Oh,
>> I'm feeling like really I never thought that, but I'm very moved by the trick gum because he there there's something what he's obviously kind of directly copying a scene from Peewee's Playhouse. Let's just say that. What did you see him doing there? You know, it it was interesting because I guess if I'm going to like analyze it, I feel like he was like, of course, really like consciously he's just imitating Peewee Herman and doing something that he thinks is funny, but like on an unconscious level, he's doing something kind of profound, which is he's saying like you're way bigger than me
>> and I'm not going to be able to beat you with brawn or fists. And I'm going to use my wits
>> to beat you. And I'm also going to use, you know, it's not like the thing about trick gum is that it is harmless, right? It doesn't it just it's just kind of embarrassing for Yeah. It's just black ooze and, you know, doesn't even taste that bad. [laughter] And
>> but he's like, I'm going to use this other weapon which is humor
>> to like diffuse the situation. And it just struck me as like what he was actually offering was a third way. And he's saying the third way is you can stand up for yourself without physically hurting someone. You can use your wits. You can be yourself. You can use the tools that you have at your disposal rather than the ones that society tells you you're supposed to have, right? And um
>> it was just something that showed me, okay, this kid can't fight, but like in his own way, this kid is kind of a lion in his own way, you know, like he's got something deep and he's got a kind of inner belief in himself that I actually didn't have as a kid. And I I'm not crediting myself for that. I think a lot of this is is just innate. But but here I was like um [clears throat] I wanted to teach him some lessons so that he could avoid a lot of the painful stuff that I felt as a kid not having self-confidence.
>> And like I saw in that moment I'm like he actually already has it. [snorts] And when you see something like that, like you realize that your job as a parent is to like walk away and just let him do his own thing, you know? And um like one of the hardest things you can do as a parent, but most important things I think you can do is like believe in your child and know that they got this, you know? And that was like the that was like the the moment where I just felt like he's got this. He's got this. And like I don't I don't have to mold him into anything. He's got this.
>> Do you still worry about him?
>> Yeah. I mean, he he got his class picture back yesterday. He is the only person in the class picture wearing a suit.
>> He's wearing a Peewee suit. He's wearing Is he wearing a bow tie?
>> I wish for the sake of this show that he [laughter] act I think we told him like you should wear if you're going to wear a suit, please wear a tie. Um but but uh but he has a bow tie and we learned how to tie a real bow tie and so he's wearing a tie in that one but he has some bow ties and and [clears throat] um vastly prefers to wear bow ties. But
>> I do still worry about him a little bit because he is different and there's no way you can be different without bumping up against society
>> in a frictionless way. Yeah.
>> Yeah. I mean, and so I know that pain is going to come his way, but I guess I just I'm not up at night about it because I I just feel like he kind of has this pee-wee quality of just like not giving a [ __ ] [laughter] That's the thing I really realized is that like what I want for [snorts] my son, for my daughter, for myself, for all the people I love
>> is just to walk around with a sense of freedom that you can be
>> yourself. And like that's the quality that I care about. Not can you kick someone's ass or can you like get back up if someone kicks your ass. It's just can you be Yeah. Can you be a pee-wee and ride your red bike around and like, you know, feel good about that? And I think that's going to be his
>> his superpower. And I I don't know. Look, let's see what hap, you know, like when the rubber meets the road, like if he actually gets horribly bullied, I don't know what's going to happen. And by the way, like I here's another thing that that has happened since the road trip is like
>> I really didn't I don't care if he doesn't want to play sports, but I did feel that like I don't want him to just be in his head. So I'm like you have to pick one physical activity.
>> So I thought of like after I saw him climbing on those butes, I thought like maybe he can get into rock climbing. M
>> and so [clears throat] I signed him up for this rock climbing class and he was really really really scared at first and he was not good at it and he's really taken to rock climbing and like that that's been a cool thing to watch
>> and and that's like an example of something where like
>> he doesn't have to fight anyone. He's not like he's not doesn't have to hurt anyone or punch anyone, but it is a it is a thing in which like he has to do a scary thing. And the thing about rock climbing is like once you conquer one kind of wall, then you do a harder wall. And so he's doing a thing where he is confronting his fears and and he's showing that he's that he's willing to go back at it and go back at it and that's been really cool to watch. And like that was not something he
>> would have been capable of last year. So So yeah. Yeah.
>> I want to see him uh climb a rock wall in a suit. [laughter]
>> That's probably his dream.
>> That That's probably his dream.
>> He's on the phone about Clementine.
>> Exactly. He's got Yeah. Sam Graham Felson. Thank you.
