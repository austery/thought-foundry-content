[Music] [Applause] my name is shant the bluman and I'm the founder and managing director of a startup called Mobility for Africa working in Zimbabwe and southern Africa we are trying to adapt the sand ler um to create um a robust e tricycle for Rural small Scout farmers in Africa so as you can tell by my accent I'm not African I grew up in Australia my relationship with Africa started when I was at University and I studied African history and after I finished my degree I wanted to go beyond books and ended up doing a volunteer stint in Northern Zambia I arrived in a village in the north and like everyone else there well like the women in the village I had to learn to collect water from the village river which was about 3 km from my house this was a very arduous task having to learn to carry a 20 L bucket of water on my head and not spill it um on that Journey back I have to confess that without the support and help and kindness of The Other Woman in the village I most probably never would have washed or been able to cook I discovered that African women are really superheroes and they make something very difficult um look very easy and I realized living in this Village this community that Mobility was a huge crisis in a way it impacted not just on the need for women to walk every day long distances to fetch water but it meant crops rotted in the field because they couldn't get to the market kids dropped out of school because the distances were too long the consequences of children getting vaccinated or mothers delivering in health clinics was often quite dire and and could put them at terrible risk after Zambia I spent 30 years uh working in the continent and most of those years for Unicef and my job was um to go to tell the story of forgotten children and families living in remote areas and I was constantly reminded by my experiences in Zambia that nothing had changed that rural women were still living in a Time Warp in a way where they had this arduous task of collecting water and carrying huge things on their head long distances it was essentially something that had become entrenched that had been normalized it's not just time that they're spending that they could be doing other productive things but when we talked to them and we conducted focus groups we also discovered it's physical drudgery it's it's exhausting it's it's what I remember from Zambia how difficult it was to to carry that bucket when things are entrenched and normalized it means it's very hard to change the status quo which which has been part of our challenge to convince people that we have a problem that needs to be solved let me give you some context um I would say that it's not just Last Mile Mobility but there is a transport crisis in in a in a continent as big as Africa basically if we compare it to other parts of the world there's a huge shortage of vehicles it's 44 Vehicles estimated per thousand in Africa as a whole in China it's 115 and in the US it's 838 per thousand and that figures distorts the division between urban and rural because most of those vehicles are predominantly in urban areas so it's much more acute and dire in rural yet the reality is that most African 70% of the continent's 1.3 billion people are living in rural areas um they make up 80% of the farm they they control small scale Farmers 80% of farmland and they produce 80% of the continent's food so they're very critical but yet many of them live huge distances from a market most of them live 2 km from an all-purpose Road um which may not even be paved and the other thing we discovered was that at least 20 to 30% of incomes were spent on the cost of getting your goods to the market or getting your kids to school or going to the clinic it's a huge income burden and while there are motorbikes increasingly they are not great for Rural women they have to straddle and most women especially older women will wear a skirt and if you have to carry a baby as well as you know a big 50 kg bag of fertilizer or seed it's it's not possible to put on a motorbike um and then finally most of the transport is controlled by men which makes it even harder so my life changed quite dramatically um in 2014 I had a job offer to come to China I essentially entered a world that was changing faster than anywhere I had ever lived before there was new ideas new innovation um ideas going to scale quickly in transport in communication in shopping in shared economy that we didn't need to own things we could use them when we needed them and of course transport was uous um we had high-speed trains we had Subways we had shared bikes we had the sander it was affordable and it was reliable and it was also increasingly going electric it contrasted very much from my day job where I was stuck in a lot of meetings and there was a lot of talk about the problem but not really on the Practical Solutions inspired by what was going on around me I started learning more about social Enterprise entrepreneurship impact investment and so in 2017 I threw caution to the wind and I thought why don't I try and bring the electric vehicle Revolution happening here to rural women in Africa and we change the way they travel so to the trepidation of my parents and at the rip old age of 46 I said goodbye to my un paycheck and I started Mobility for Africa and I returned to the continent to start this New Journey and I did a pitch deck and a business plan and tried to raise the money thinking it was a brilliant idea but friends quickly told me that it was not going to be easy to raise money for something that was so new and hadn't been tested so I came back to China in 2018 and reconnected with friends and colleagues from chingua University it all started here Professor Shu was an amazing academic here and runs the lifelong learning lab with his director Emma Pang and they listened to my idea and they said we'll find some students and you can start a pilot so we found five PhD students all from very different backgrounds from sociology to energy to Automotive mechanics and those students helped us to design our pilot we knew at the beginning that we didn't want to just import the tricycle that wouldn't work we needed to build an African tricycle um and we also needed to give it an African name so we called it HBA which means let's go in end debilly which is one of the main languages in Zimbabwe my co-founder Felicity um had a farm about 120 km out of Harari so we were able to launch our pilot at her Farm working with the smallow farmers in that Community it was all a bit crazy um we had a lot to address um and the students did a lot of Preparatory work and desktop reading I mean how can the tricycle work for African roads does it need modifications and changes can women Drive um this is motorized transport most of them may have learned to ride a bicycle but but many even not a bicycle um how do we make it affordable how do we make the business model work so we could raise the type of investment we needed to scale um and ultimately we wanted to go electric so how do we charge the tricycle um and what and where does the electricity come from things I knew very little about when I started the beauty was that the pilot helped us start and we had 50 tricycles arrive we crowdfunded we had the students arrive we had technicians from herb that came with the tricycles and taught local technicians how to assemble within 2 weeks we launched the pilot the first year of piloting involved working with women we had 30 tricycles we deployed so we put the women in groups of three and they rented the tricycle um and they shared it and it was very interesting because at first the men were quite jealous and why are the women getting this transport and weren't they but over this journey they understood that if their women had more time and could do more things they were earning more money and income and they were less less they wouldn't nag them as much so we've actually seen huge shift in gender relations with the introduction of the tricycle the the second stage was part of this stage was how do we teach them how to drive so we developed a driving course a 5-day driving course where we taught them about road safety and the basic controls of a Huma and they had to be certified and qualified and this is a quote from one of our women um that she could not believe that she could drive so just the pure excitement of our women who graduated and got their certificate was was incredibly inspiring we then in the second phase of the pilot added some more tricycles so we had about 60 tricycles in total um and we started experimenting with the businesses that they could operate and so we had some women apply um and they were groups of women trading and they had a business where the transport could be used to help their income so here you see women going door Todo selling secondhand clothes This was um obviously meant they didn't need to sit in a market but they could go door too we had here is one of our new customers Susan who has a bakery at home and she's now able to transport 100 loaves of bread which she can sell every day she lives 10 km from where she sells the bread and she can go door Todo um so she's increased her income exponentially we we also set up a mini DD um so we basically knew that in a community there was huge demand and we didn't just want the wealthiest people in the community to own the transport and maybe use it like a car and it sit all day we wanted it to be used as all day every day so we commissioned drivers women who would use it as a transport and logistic service and this proved incredibly viable because there was huge demand as you can appreciate it can carry people it can carry Goods it can carry produce and they could call their driver and book a time they could get Grandma delivered to the clinic if she needed something babies needed to go so it was it was it was very much proven that that was a great business in agriculture um we also saw huge economic gain these ladies their Farm was 3 km from their house so with the transport they were able to take more fertilizer um a manure they could make at home and were able to farm more of their land so their yield increased exponentially and then obviously they could make more money so we got to this stage where after the first two years we knew that the demand was there we knew that women could drive we knew it could have a catalytic impact on incomes but essentially we were faced with this challenge how do we charge the Humber and where does the electricity come from and also ultimately how do we find the right battery and I'll tell you a little bit about that Journey but first as background in addition to a Mobility crisis we have an energy crisis in the continent we have a deficit of reliable energy and that's particularly acute in rural areas so across the continent we we see 55% of the population without access to electricity and then when you do have electricity it may or may not be reliable the grid is often unreliable so people supplement it with using diesel generators if you can afford it because diesel is expensive it's not available in rural areas petrol is imported it's expensive and it's also a huge contributor to why we have a Mobility crisis because it requires um foreign currency and it's usually focused in urban areas so in rural areas petrol is much more expensive and often just carried in smaller quantities so the energy crisis meant that while in theory Electric Mobility was could be a game Cher we needed to obviously make sure we had enough energy to charge our batteries and the good news is that the cost of solar and the cost of putting up renewable energy small minig grids is now much more affordable and durable I realized that while we'd taken off the shelf the tricycle and we were working on it the battery that was used in China was a lead acid battery because the sandur is primarily used for the poorest people and in rural areas in in China there is electricity but it would not work in rural Africa it was not appropriate we took off the shelf lithium batteries and we also realized primarily they were for storage and they wouldn't withstand very bumpy roads so essentially I realized I needed to find my own Elon musk and so the Battery Technology we did a mapping we hunted the the the sector in China and obviously the big guys weren't going to talk to a startup testing a new idea in a rural African context but we were very very fortunate to connect with Richard jaia so he is an engineer with the PHD in lithium and he has worked at Tesla and he did actually sit very close to Elon Musk so I was like wow I have my golden ticket and Richard was willing to work with us over the last three years obviously Co didn't help because we had to do things remotely but we basically spent the last three years working in testing um battery and charging system that would work for Rural Africa because I knew from our pilot that we needed a battery that was basically going to take the tricycle longer distances the lead had taken the tricycle 50 km at best and that was not going to work the distances in our rural pilot area was at least 15 to 20 kilomet between the health clinic and the town and the market and people's homes so I said to Richard I want a battery that's going to go 100 kilm I also want the safest lithium chemistry uh we don't want you know fires and to cause problems and we also wanted a battery that was going to be longlasting we didn't want something that would only last a short cycle a short life cycle and then have to be replaced because obviously we already have a problem with with Recycling and waste management so it was critical that we had a battery that could go many cycles and we also wanted it to be storage we wanted integrated storage we put in a charging station so this was our first charging station and now what we have is a modular system where our batteries basically act to purpose so they're going to have one life in the tricycle and we're hoping that they're going to take the tricycle maybe 50 to 60,000 kilom and then as they start to degenerate we can use them as storage but also we can potentially and what we want to test now is other productive tools that farmers can use to increase their productivity and as you can see the solar is there we we've decided to choose sites which have solar and also electricity because the the African governments are focusing on Rural electrification and we need quite a lot of energy so where we've created a system where we can charge from any source of energy and it goes straight into an inverter and it's integrated so for it's much more efficient than when I first launched in 2019 we've also got a battery swapping system so the batteries are big and heavy but as you can see these r female technicians they are strong enough um to to swap the batteries and we set up fleets in a 30 kmet radius and then we set up um swapping locations people can obviously come to the charging Hub and swap but we also deliver at different locations to reduce their mileage back to a charging station we've set up a factory we started with the factory this is our second Factory for assembling the tricycles and with Richard's support we've also um started doing local assembly of the batteries we've designed a very smart battery management system that regulates and manages the cells to make sure they're going to last those many cycles um but obviously all of that wouldn't work if we didn't have local skills and local people to understand and maintain and service um one of the great things about the partnership um with fur energy and Richard's team is they've come back and forth especially since Co ended so we've had technicians come train our staff um in this photo you see RBI who's one of our young engineers and she came to China and is learning so it's very much been a crosscultural um technology transfer experience we've got very young capable smart people in Africa so even if people don't have much formal education they're hungry to learn Richard and his team also helped us to build a curriculum so we developed a one-month curriculum for for low skilled semiskilled workers and we pilot tested it at one of the local vocational training schools the 20 students around around now all working for us at Mobility for Africa and our sites but obviously if Africa is going to transition to Green transport we're going to need to build those skills over the long term we also realized when we were pilot testing and especially when covid hit and with my experience at UNICEF that we wanted to focus on the whole community and that meant to me Service delivery I had as I said spent plenty of time in rural Africa been to rural clinics with no transport been to local police stations with no transport it's very hard to do your job when you have no transport agava Clinic is in our pilot site they cover the 30 kilm radius they have to provide Health Services in that 30 km radius there's about 6,000 people in that community and they had no transport so the team there has done a remarkable job sister J demo who seeing this photo and her team of six workers have all been trained they've set up mobile sites within that in their their catchment area where they go and they deliver vaccination coverage they were doing Co they were doing HPV they were doing childhood vaccinations when the baby's born they can take the mother back to her house with the baby they can check up on people that are HIV positive or TB and that have TB and need need their medication and may not want to come to the clinic or no may not be well enough to come to the clinic so they have been remarkable in using that transport you can see they're the best performing um clinic in the district just with transport they were able to conduct a polio campaign last year there was an outbreak of polio sadly and so just being able to go and move has been remarkable before this they would have to call the district and request transport and often what happened even if there was a motorbike or a vehicle there may not be petrol to get that vehicle to that rural community so they're stuck but the beauty is that what we're hoping to do now is actually um test with the Ministry of Health to get more evidence to show how electric tricycles can make a huge difference in terms of health outcomes and the charging technology we've designed could be used both for cold chain storage and providing basic light and and electricity to the clinic but also be used obviously for running a small Fleet and and having a huge impact on the community just to end I think we're all aware that we're living in a climate crisis we have got rapidly changing climate and Africa is on the front line of that climate crisis um Africa has contributed about 4% of global emissions and yet is really taking a big impact on what's Happening um this year alone in southern Africa we had a terrible drought 45 days with no rain during the rainy season so it's real it's happening now and so I'm a big believer that we can't wait for the perfect solution we can't wait for the perfect time that we have to just move now and with a bit more urgency and so we've really tried to prove over the last five years and we're now ready for scale we want to go China big we've proven that if you can introduce a fleet of e tricycles in a community and you can share that transport you can have a catalytic impact in terms of the business model as I said we've tried many different formulas and now we've basically simplified our formula this year so we're still committed to women 75% of our drivers and customers will will always be women we do a lease to purchase they apply they have to be qualified and then they buy back the tricycle to own it fully after 12 months but they also commit to a certain number of battery swaps um we obviously they don't own the batteries we swap them at a fee and they have to do a minimum of four battery swaps a week which means they're using that Humber at least 400 kilm we don't want the Humber sitting we've also really focused on building the skills our tricycles that we brought to weder in 2019 are still working are still oper operational yes we've had to replace bare Parts but the idea is that they should be able to last if they're looked after and serviced and so that's a big part of what we're building with our ecosystem of after care services and building the skills this is one of our drivers Mavis she's picked up one of her customers they've come straight from the field where they've loaded the Humber with tomatoes which means no produce is going to waste because it can't be carried on a head and she's been delivered to the market where now she can sell it and hopefully earn more income um I think this journey has taught me that um we're not just dealing Mobility for Africa is many different things it's about renewable energy it's about Battery Technology it's about Mobility it's it's about the freedom that Mobility can unlock and we one lovely story I was in one of our sites and one of our drivers told me how she delivered a baby in The Humper on the way to the clinic the baby named king and the mother were delivered safely and there that's the sort of real impact that we're having just to conclude we have a saying uh an African proverb that that I think of often it says when when you want to go fast go alone when you want to go far go together and Mobility for Africa has been a much longer Journey than I ever anticipated but it's been a journey where I've been very lucky to have great allies and people that believe in the journey we still have a long way to go um we we've got 300 tricycles now which feels tiny in China but we have big Ambitions we want every every small scale farmer and every rural woman to be able to have a tricycle so thank you sh [Applause] [Music]
