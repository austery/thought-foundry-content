For 35 years, every Olympic result you ever saw on screen, every split time, every medal count, every score ran through the servers of a single company, a French IT giant called ATS. They started at Barcelona in 1992 and never stopped. By the time they reached Paris 2024, ATS has processed over 300 million results across a dozen Olympics and defended the games against hundreds of millions of cyber attacks. And then just before the Winter Olympics in Pyongqen, a piece of malware called Olympic Destroyer collected a TOSS employee credentials, crashed the official Olympics website during the opening ceremony, knocked out Wi-Fi across the venue, and killed the ticket sales for hours. The company that was supposed to be the tech fortress of the games had been breached since December, and nobody caught it until the lights went on. ATAS patched the hole and carried on. But in the background, the company was falling apart. And by 2024, as it delivered the final Olympics in Paris, its stock has fallen 98%. It was drowning in billions of debt and begging the French government for an emergency loan just to survive. After Paris 2024, ATS exited the Olympics top sponsorship program after 35 years of Olympic partnership. And into the void stepped Google, Snowflake, Cisco, and Deote. The company that knew more about Olympic operations than anyone on Earth almost collapsed. But the companies stepping in are redefining what Olympic sponsorship is supposed to be about. The Olympic is becoming a live 17-day proof of concept for AI at global scale. That changes the economics of the Olympic Games. The old model monetized broadcast rights and visibility. The new model monetizes data, algorithms, and infrastructure that compounds in value across Olympic cycles. For sponsors, it's a live demo. For the International Olympic Committee, it's a revenue stream that doesn't end when the games do. And for fans, athletes, and host cities, it means participating in systems designed to generate insights worth billions of dollars. Today is about that shift. how the Olympics is evolving from a broadcast event showcasing the extremes of human abilities into a data platform where athletic competition runs alongside industrialcale AI experimentation. Let's dive in. Look at whose logos are on the sides of tracks. When a company sponsors the Olympics, this isn't really about advertising space. I mean, okay, you see the Coca-Cola logo on the side. So what? It's not like you're going to run and get a lot of coke all of a sudden. It is about these logos buying access to certain aspects of the games. And the shift from a toas to what comes next tells you everything about what the Olympics is becoming. Milano Cartina 2026 is the first Olympics after ATS's exit. And the sponsor roster reads very differently. In Milan, the partners are Juniper Networks, cyber security and network ops. It's their first sponsorship of the Olympics, by the way. Alibaba Cloud, the provider of the Olympic GBT and a pin trading station. And Deote, the official tech partner. They're running the Olympic fan data platform. They did it back in Paris 24 and scaled to Milan. But do you notice anything peculiar? There isn't a single data platform in the core lineup of partners. Milano Cortina flirts with AI. It's testing the waters, detecting key moments in seconds, Olympic GBT chatbot, drones moving alongside athletes for point of view footage. Deoid's fan data platform. All of this is useful stuff. It's fun to play with, but all of these things are nice to have add-ons on top of the games. LA28 will be drastically different. LA28 doesn't just add data infrastructure to the Olympics. LA28 is the data infrastructure. LA28 is going to be the first Olympics where AI cloud infra and data platforms are foundational sponsor categories. If you listen to the tech stack behind the Olympics, it's giving a typical enterprise SAS feature planning meeting. Google Cloud, Snowflakes AI data cloud, Cisco AI networking, Deoid tech consulting, and T-Mobile's 5G. So the question isn't whether LA28 will collect data. The question is what exactly are they building with it? Which brings us to the most notable sponsor in Olympic history. Snowflake. The PR says Snowflake will centralize athlete training data, health records, and nutrition. But Snowflake isn't a health or a fitness app. Snowflake is a data platform. Its core product lets companies store, process, and analyze massive amounts of data in the cloud. So what LA28 and Snowflake are building is a data system for the entire games. They're building a layer where dozens of sports organizations, US Olympic Committee, individual sport federations, Team USA, LA28 operations, sponsors, broadcasters can all plug into one data environment. Data monetization in sports is exploding. Leagues sell player tracking to firms who bet on those players. Broadcasters use it for AR overlays. Dynamic pricing on tickets skyrockets the revenue. And the partnership with Snowflake accelerates that. You may ask, but who decides how this data gets shared? What about data privacy laws? How is it that all of these companies are going to access something that only the Olympic Committee gets to control? And the answer is data. Clean rooms. Snowflakes clean rooms solve the core friction in sports sponsorship. Clean rooms allow rights holders and sponsors to look for overlapping audiences without violating any privacy laws. Let's use fan data as an example. At the top of the pyramid, there is a rights holder who owns fan data. In the context of the next summer games, LA28 is the rights holder. LA28 collects data on their fans, ticket sales, app loginins, Olympic ID preferences, merch, athletes they follow, sports categories of choice. This data gets anonymized and loaded into Snowflake and then it gets turned into profiles and segments. For example, a high value LA volleyball fan or a casual crosscountry ski enthusiast. It is basically like scanning your loyalty card at a grocery store, but instead you're being labeled as this fan buys $50 merch. Then there is the second layer underneath the rights holder, the sponsors. For example, Delta Airlines. Delta also has a lot of data on their customers, but they can't legally share personal data because that would violate privacy laws. So what Snowflake is doing is it introduces the concept of clean rooms. and clean rooms let anyone upload anonymized data into Snowflake without sharing personal identifiable information. So Delta can also share their data. For example, frequent flyers from West Coast hubs. And this is where LA28 and Delta test if their audiences overlap. LA28 puts in, "Here are the fans who bought volleyball tickets and spent $50 plus on merch." Delta puts in, "Here are our frequent flyers who book economy to West Coast cities?" The clean room runs a query. How much overlap is there. Do Olympic fans match Delta customers? And the results look something like this. 32% of high-v valueue Olympic fans are already Delta customers and they're 2.3 times more likely to book flights after attending the events. And then it turns into something bigger. Snowflake creates categories of fans, high value volleyball fans in California, swimming enthusiasts who buy premium merch. Each of these groups is a segment, a group of customers with similar behaviors and preferences. and sponsors can subscribe to the segments. Delta Airlines is willing to pay a monthly fee of, let's say, $10,000 just to have access to these profiles that they can target. With this information, they can run campaigns like 20% off flights to Brisbane for the 2032 games for all Olympic fans. And the beauty of this is that they would be targeting users that Snowflake knows are likely to convert because the data says so. While this is happening, LA28 makes money on every transaction. Every time someone books a flight through that campaign, LA28 takes a cut. And now multiply this by the number of sponsors who subscribe. Delta, Visa, Coca-Cola, hotels, car rentals. All of these players exchanging behavioral data. These insights are fed back into AI models, making the next prediction even better. The profiles get richer, the targeting gets sharper, and suddenly a fan profile that was worth $20 is now worth $30, $40, $50 because sponsors are willing to pay more for access to data that is this accurate. The logos that you see in the sponsorship roster redefine what the Olympic Games are. The International Olympic Committee published an Olympic AI agenda, the purpose of which is to embed AI into the commercial DNA of every future games. AI will be embedded in athlete sport, equal access, game operations, fan engagement, and governance. Each of these areas maps to a revenue web. Let me show you how. In previous games, let's say comparing Tokyo to Paris 2024, the Olympic Committee had information about their fans, but that information was not shared across platforms. You, as a fan, could get an email from them about a sport that you would not necessarily care about. And then after the event, they would enter a period of complete silence between the summer and winter games, which is a natural thing, one might say. Sure. Except silence doesn't generate revenue. In LA28, Genai will be used to craft messages in 12 different languages, targeting fans in different tones, through different channels, and with different calls to action. For example, I'm a huge fan of figure skating. In my case, the system would detect that I have watched all of Kori Sakamoto's routines. I replayed her jump breakdowns. I spent a lot of data studying her technical analysis content. For me, Jenna would create a message. Sakamoto just scored 147 points in her freekate, her season's best since worlds. Tap for her technical breakdown chart. Everything I just did adds up like pearls on a necklace. Every time I open the app, I fire a session event. Olympics ID login timestamp device. I tap on figure skating women's freekate. I tap on her program components or jump technique breakdown. Each action streams into the Olympic fan data platform. The platform runs behavioral scoring classifying me as performance motivation cohort because my dwell time is linked to technical charts four times higher than emotional highlights. When Sakamoto's free skate ends and official scores get published, there's going to be a notification that will be sent specifically to me. Genai will compose it through the cohort template and personalize it with the score. Okay, every data point gets recorded. You get a personalized message. So, who profits from this? Everyone does. Number one, that push notification is the hook. The fan taps it with a high probability based on their profile. I land on the jump to jump comparison and I spend 90 seconds on the technical breakdown page. That page contains an ad from a top sponsor, get team Japan's merch. If the fan converts on the $35 cap, the LA28 e-commerce system captures the sale and attributes it to the push notification. Multiply that across millions of fans receiving hundreds of personalized pushes over 17 days and the merch revenue from the personalization engine alone could turn into tens of millions. Number two, the page that I land on has a powered by Omega timing brand integration and a Visa checkout widget. Those placements are random. They're shown to me because the platform knows my fans profile. Let's say I'm classified as a high intent performance fan who historically clicks on sports analytics content and in addition to that has a Visa card linked to my Olympics account. Number three, every query associated with the fan, every trigger that fires, every Janaya call that composes a message, all of it runs on Snowflake's infrastructure. Snowflake wants this partnership because the Olympics generate massive query volume that Snowflake is able to handle. And the fact that they're able to handle it is a live demo to every enterprise chief technology officer watching the Olympics becomes a Super Bowl ad for Snowflake. except instead of a 30- secondond slot, it's a 17day live demo processing billions of events. And finally, Google and its AI mode. I might simply Google Sakamoto's final score and Google's AI mode will return an answer from Olympics.com. And that would be combined with a YouTube highlight video and a sponsored NBC streaming prompt. Google captures the search data, serves ads against it, and attributes the traffic back to the Olympic partnership. And me as a fan, all I get is a better notification. It's just an alert that is in fact relevant to me. And I don't think about the fact that my 90 seconds on that page generate value for six different companies simultaneously. This is brilliant and beautiful from the business standpoint. To understand what LA28 will become, think about what Paris 24 already normalized. In May 2023, the French Parliament passed the Olympic Games Law, which legalized algorithmic video surveillance on an experimental basis. 200 cameras in the Paris area were upgraded with AI, plus around 300 cameras across 46 metro stations. LA28 inherits this pattern because it was done before. But now put this in perspective of a fundamentally different political and legal environment. California, for example, has very strong consumer privacy protections. But on the other hand, the fourth amendment of the United States only restricts government but not private companies. And LA28 is a private organizing committee working with private tech sponsors who are not forbidden from deploying AI surveillance. So what data will be collected at LE28? Fan movement patterns, entry to seat, seat to concession, concession to merge store. All of this boils down to heat maps and dwelltime data, cashierless checkouts, links, biometric or tap to pay identity to purchases, QR scans, augmented reality filter activations, inapp checkins, CCTV cameras, drones, license plate readers, and communications metadata. Now to the interesting part. Who owns this data? Fan engagement is owned by the International Olympic Committee and LA28. Security surveillance data will be collected by government agencies. Venue operations data is collected by private contractors, Cisco, T-Mobile, and Snowflake. Biometric data does not have a specific policy yet, but it is the most legally contested category. And what happens after security tech goes to market? The four French companies that built Paris's AI surveillance system now have a live, globally visible case study to sell to every city, every stadium, every operator, every event organizer on Earth because it was tested at the Olympics. Biometric infrastructure normalizes and expands. 47% of global stadiums prioritizing biometrics in 2025 are watching LA28 as a proof point. If facial authentication at Olympic venues works smoothly, we should be expecting rapid adoption across NFL, NBA, MLB, and concerts. Fan data becomes the permanent commercial backbone. It will be folded into profiles. It will be enriching them for postgame sponsors as well. And the moment LA28 is done, expect that targeting to be used for Brisbane 2032. So where does this leave us? Each Olympics serves as the validation for the next. The surveillance systems tested in Paris are now deployed across French transit until 2027. The data architecture built for LA28 will carry forward to Brisbane 2032. The biometric data normalized at the Olympics will migrate to NFL stadiums, NBA arenas, and concert halls. Every data point collected has compounding value because it improves AI models, trains the next generation of systems, and increases the baseline expectations for what normal data collection looks like at large scale events. We hope this was helpful. Let us know what you think in the comments. We'll see you next time. Bye.
