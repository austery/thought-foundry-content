hi everybody tune in to this short version of the podcast which we do every Friday for the long version tune in on Wednesdays hi everybody I'm Nikola tangin and today I'm here with one of the most incredible Tech entrepreneurs Of All Times who started off in his freshman dorm room and built his company to one of the largest technology companies in the world now onethird of you will have a PC with his name on Michael D welcome thank you so much great to be with you normally Michael I would kind of start with the Press but I think when it comes to you we have to go all the way back you know with the beginning you were very young and you bought an IBM computer and most people would kind of start to do computer things but you took it apart instead what did you how did that happen what did what did you see inside that computer well back then you could actually learn a lot because you didn't have these large chips that we have today that are an amalgamation of lots of small chips yeah and so you could literally uh get a book that would explain what each chip did and you could understand the circuits and as I said I was upgrading computers to make them do more right you know more memory more storage uh make them go faster right and so what I found in this IBM personal computer was that none of the parts were made by IBM and then I sort of discovered that that the uh cost that they were uh you know the price they were charging for the computer was roughly six times the cost of the parts right and so it didn't really seem like it was fair to me that that it was that expensive IBM was the most valuable company in the world at that stage and you were 16 year old they they were the most valuable company in the world and they were about 80% of the value of the sector you know called technology at the time so they were more dominant in their sector than any company maybe in any time in history I mean are there any companies today that are 80% of one sector of the S&P 500 no not even close so yeah they they were incredibly successful company and then um I went off to college I was uh Texas University of Texas I was a biology major I was supposed to be a doctor cuz your parents wanted you to study Premed sort of the family business you know be a doctor and U strong encouragement from the parents so I'm not in in my parents house anymore I'm in the dorm room I've got a lot of time right you know University of Texas is a big school some of the classes are enormous if you show up or you don't show up they don't really notice all the time right so you so you didn't know show up so I'm kind of doing this computer thing and and it's getting bigger and bigger and um my parents found out about they got very upset they kind of made me stop I stopped for 10 days and uh and that's when I decided that actually this was something more so um in early May of 1984 uh I the company was incorporated Del computer Corporation became a corporation uh and it was about a week or two before my final exams of my freshman year and so the first year we had $6 million in revenue and uh the second year was about 33 million and we we grew about 80% per year for the first eight years compounded why do you think there are more entrepreneurs in America than elsewhere I think there's something in the in the culture that you know is is accepting uh risk even embracing risk in a good way right um that says well okay if you try something and it doesn't quite work and you fail it's okay try something else right and maybe that that is not as accepted everywhere I think there's you know a combination of factors right it's this risk acceptance It's Capital that will invest behind that there's a history of other entrepreneurs that you can look to that I look to and others look to and said well yeah they did it so maybe I could do it did you think it would risk it at the time did you did you ever have fear no no so if you have nothing nothing to lose right so uh it didn't seem like a big risk I mean the risk for me was if it didn't work I go back to college so um a third of your income is from commercial PCS um like the one I have on at my desk what are the important Innovations taking place here now they look a bit like they don't change that much right I mean they look a bit like the one I had last year and last year well actually what the PC does is very very different than it used to do and so we keep asking it to do more and more things right now the big thing that's that's you know going in the PC is AI and you know we used to have the the CPU right then we had the GPU now we have something called the npu a neural processing unit and it is a part of the processor that speeds up the AI activities that occur on the PC to an incredible degree and pretty much all the software that you're using is being Rewritten so that anytime there's a prompt uh or some you know user uh interaction that is that experience is enhanced and made better using Ai and most of that AI maybe 85 90% of it will run locally on your PC and that's probably the biggest thing that's going on in addition to to you know longer battery life we have you know more than 24-hour battery life you know super super bright display super thin super light very secure you know all the things that you'd want in a in a in a new machine to replace the one that's that's several years old there's so we will continue to buy new ones basically yeah I mean if you want to be in the in the future you were listed on a so ex change for 25 years and then in 2013 you took Del private to get off the stock exchange correct why why did you do that you know around 2010 we started uh evolving the company in uh into new areas and we were making Acquisitions and we were building uh you know cloud data center networking storage capability and kind of the more we did that the less the market liked it at the same time something else was going on you had the the smartphone and the tablet right were sort of On The Rise and so a lot of people looked at the smartphone and the tablet they said well that that's the new thing we don't need the PC anymore because we have we have these other things and Dell even though it has all these other businesses it's kind of a PC company so the PC's dead so therefore Dell's dead right so so the stock kept going down at one point the stock is like really low and I'm thinking this is kind of crazy I this company's generating lots of free cash flow billions of dollars of free cash flow every year it had generated $150 billion dollar of cash flow in in its lifetime let's just do a huge buyback let's buy back all the shares so that's what we did but you also a bol so when it was Private you a bolt EMC very big deal yeah we so so when we when we when we took you sp like $67 billion right so biggest technology acquisition correct the world seen right so when when when we took Dell private it was the largest take private ever technology yeah and then a private company uh bought a$7 billion public company and took it private too which was kind of fun and um that significantly accelerated our transformation now we kind of became uh like a public company then because we had a tracking stock associated with emc's ownership in VMware and uh and then ultimately we we became a fully public company again at the end of 2018 so it's the most profitable private Equity deal ever I think that's what I'm told it it's worked it's worked out well could have been a lot worse but it worked out well what is the corer culture at Dell how would you describe it it's winning it's it's it's it's delivering value for our customers it is understanding their requirements and solving them it is uh a results orientation um it is uh play nice but win you mentioned uh fun uh a few times and clearly you are more fun than most SE that's uh that's a very that's very clear what what place does humor play in your company I think Yuber is is very important yeah I mean if you can't laugh joke around uh play tricks on people you know you're doing it wrong right so you you have you have to be able to laugh at yourself and laugh you know and uh and humor is incredibly important
