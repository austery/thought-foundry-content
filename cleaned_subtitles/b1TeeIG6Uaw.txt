Today I'm talking with Victor Shih,
who is the director of the 21st
Century China Center at UC San Diego.
China is obviously one of the most
important economic and geopolitical
issues of our time, doubly so if
you believe what I believe about AI.
I was especially keen to talk to
you because you have deep expertise
not only in Chinese elite politics,
but also its economic system
and fiscal and banking policies.
We'll get into all of that
before we get into the AI topics.
Is China actually a more
decentralized system than America?
If you look at government spending
by provincial governments vs.
national government in China, it's
about 85% local+provincial and 15% national.
In the US, if you combine
state and local it's 50%, and
the federal government is 50%.
When you think of an authoritarian
system, you often think of it as
something very top-down, where
the center controls everything.
But looking at those numbers,
it seems like China might
actually be quite decentralized.
Or is that the wrong way
to look at the numbers?
For a while China was quite
decentralized, from the mid-1970s
all the way until the mid-1990s.
China was very decentralized.
Local governments generated
a lot of revenue, but they
also spent a lot of money.
It incentivized them to do basically
good things, such as trying to attract as
much FDI as possible, trying to attract
as much local investment as possible,
give tax breaks, and so on and so forth.
China had a very good period of mainly
private sector–driven growth because
of this fiscal decentralization.
That's the understanding
of most economists.
But then there was a tax
centralization in 1994, where the
central government basically said,
“Okay, this is ridiculous. We don't want
to end up like the Soviet Union and fall
into different pieces. We need to control
fiscal income.” So then they grabbed
the most lucrative source of taxation
at that time—and it continues to be
the case—which is the value-added tax.
The value-added taxes—and in
subsequent decades pretty much
all other tax categories—are now
collected by the central government.
Then they reimburse part of
the money to the provinces.
Supposedly they say, “Okay, now you can
spend the money as you wish.” But in
reality, that's not the case. In reality
it's kind of like, “If you do this thing,
then I'll give you a little bit of money.
But you have to do the thing that I
want you to do to get this money, to get
this grant.” So the fiscal autonomy, I
would say, has been falling since 1994.
There are different periods.
Sometimes there's a
little bit more autonomy.
From 2000 to
recently, until 2020, the localities
gained more autonomy vis-à-vis land sales.
That's when the real estate
market was going very well.
Even though they couldn't
control the tax revenue, they
could control the land revenue.
But then the central government
basically killed the land market in 2022.
Now I think localities in China are highly
dependent on the central government.
Let's start at the very top.
First, I want to understand the personnel.
If you look at the
members of the Politburo
and their pasts, a lot of them were
provincial leaders, and then had
some kind of local role before that.
But in many cases, they'll have stints,
as the head of some chemical engineering
SOE, or they studied engineering.
Xi Jinping himself has a PhD
in chemical engineering, right?
Something, some kind of…
That’s what I
want to ask about.
If you go through the list, a lot
of them are PhD economists, PhD
industrial engineers, and so on.
Some even have PhDs in Marxist theory.
That seems fake.
Are they actual technocrats?
If you look at their degrees,
they seem quite impressive.
Or is this just fake
made-up credentialism?
If there’s a PhD economist in the
Politburo, should I be impressed and
think they really understand economics?
Or should I just think
this is a fake degree?
So the former Premier of China,
Li Keqiang, his undergraduate
degree was in economics.
He studied under one of the
best economists in China.
So I think he understood economics.
In the Politburo today, there’s this
wing made up of military-industrialists
who were trained as engineers.
They indeed were trained in
the best programs in China.
For example, Ma Xingrui,
the Party Secretary of
Xinjiang, is in the Politburo.
He graduated from Tsinghua University.
Zhang Guoqing, who worked in the military
industry for years and, I don’t know if
it was Tsinghua but he graduated from
one of the top science programs in China.
So they do know a lot about science.
But does that mean they
know how to govern?
That’s a somewhat different question.
But you also have other
cases, like Ding Xuexiang.
He’s in charge of cybersecurity in China.
He has a technical background
in metallurgical forging.
Graduating from, not the MIT of China
but maybe closer to the IIT of China,
a second-tier science institute
founded by a Soviet expert who wanted
to teach China how to do metallurgy.
Does that kind of very
specialized technical knowledge
make you a better leader?
I think it depends on the person.
In the Chinese Communist Party,
as people rise through the ranks,
they have to have political acumen.
If you don’t have political acumen,
you’re not going to make it.
Some people, on top of their technical
expertise, turn out to have that acumen.
But it’s not something you can know
ex ante, except for the princelings.
The princelings are special not
just because of their genes.
Yes, they’re the children
of high-level officials.
But they grew up honing this
political acumen because their
parents could teach them about it.
So some of them turn out to
have this political acumen.
They’re pretty smart.
They don’t necessarily have
the best degrees from the best
universities in China, but they
end up being very successful.
It’s not necessarily the case
that all the Peking and Tsinghua
graduates reach the top.
They are certainly
disproportionately represented in
the Politburo, but they don’t dominate.
At the end of the day,
it is somewhat random.
I still feel confused about how to
model the competence of the Party.
On the one hand, they’re
super educated in STEM.
They’re selected at least partly on
merit, etc. On the other hand you
see things like… A lot of Zero-COVID
was just genuinely stupid, scrubbing
down airport runways and so forth.
And it just went on way too long.
Why was nobody steering the ship then?
What’s the right way to
put this picture together?
There's a lot of expertise at the lower
level that can feed into the higher level.
There are channels for doing that.
I would say there are a lot of channels.
So they're not so
dysfunctional on that score.
But what time and again leads to
suboptimal policy is the Party’s
instinct to preserve itself, and in a way
worse than that, to preserve its power.
It’s not just, “Let’s do this
thing because it will lead to
a better public health outcome
and we’ll survive politically.”
They’re mindset is, “Even if we would
survive politically, if doing that
would result in a loss of power—like
having less control over the banks, or
scientists becoming more independent—then
let’s not do that.
Because what's the cost?
Some people die, whatever.
We have slower growth
for a couple of years.
But if we get to preserve power, we
will go ahead and preserve power.”
Here's a question.
Traditionally, if
you study economics in an
American university, you
learn about supply and demand.
You learn why certain regulations
are bad, why tariffs are bad,
etc. Basic 101 teaches you that.
So if a lot of the members at the
highest levels of the Communist Party
have that basic understanding, what’s
the reason they make mistakes that
many economists say they shouldn’t do?
People talk about rebalancing a lot.
Why don’t they think increasing
consumption is a good idea?
There’s a traditional reason, and
then there’s today’s reason, which
is on top of the traditional reason.
The traditional reason is that, in
education in China, you get tracked
into sciences, STEM, or you get tracked
into social science or humanities.
If you get tracked into STEM,
you may never learn anything
about supply and demand.
It’s just not required.
You just learn a bunch of math.
You learn a lot of engineering,
if you want to be an engineer.
Then there are some art
classes for you to select.
You can select the art classes,
or maybe one econ class.
For a while, learning
economics was popular.
In the 1990s, all the engineering
students would have taken an econ class.
But for people who were trained
before that, they would not.
The one class that is still required
for everybody is government ideology.
In fact, the requirement for
government ideology has been
ratcheted up in recent years.
I look at all the applications
of students from China.
I look at what classes they’ve taken.
Now, once a year, they have to
take a class called "Situation and
Policy," which is basically just
the Chinese government's perspective
on all kinds of different issues.
But that’s not economics,
it’s not accounting.
It’s not some basic skill.
It’s just telling people what the
government prefers on a given topic.
So that’s the traditional reason.
You can have some very high-level
officials—even if they have a PhD in
nuclear engineering—who may not know
very much about how the market works, how
society works, and so on and so forth.
The new reason is that we have
one very powerful figure in
the Chinese Communist Party.
Being a Politburo member used
to give you some autonomy in
the domain that you govern over.
That is no longer the case.
If Xi Jinping expresses a preference over
a policy direction, that is the direction
you have to go toward, no matter what.
Because if he observes that
you're dragging your feet, or
that you're pursuing a slightly
different agenda, you’ll be purged.
And we’ve seen cases of that.
At some point, we’ll talk
about Leading Small Groups and
the way they work.
But the picture you get from the fact that
Xi is monitoring what all these different
Politburo members are doing… He’s noticing
whether they’re dragging their feet.
He’s leading all these small teams.
They
organize different leaders who are
the heads of ministries or commissions
relevant to a specific project.
I guess every week they meet and they
hammer out who’s a bottleneck, what
we need to do to get a project moving.
So Xi has ratcheted up the
number of these meetings.
The picture you get is of someone
who is micromanaging details
across all these policy areas.
If you read Stalin biographies,
Stalin actually was a person like
this, obviously not to great effect.
But he was interested in micromanaging
every single detail, from theater
productions to steel production.
Everything.
Is that who Xi is?
Yeah.
If you look at what he does day to day,
he spends a lot of time in meetings.
It’s astonishing.
The Chinese leadership, they're not going
to play golf 3 days out of the week.
Xi Jinping and his colleagues are having
meetings about policies almost every
day, like 270 days out of the year.
The study sessions of the Politburo,
are these meetings substantive?
Are they real?
Is he actually learning the
intricacies of, "Here’s how
Zero-COVID has impacted this province
and here’s why we should..."?
Because if you read the
announcements from the Party or
departments, they’re so vapid.
It’s typical Communist-speak.
How real are these meetings?
So I’ve talked to some people
who’ve lectured to the Politburo.
I think they’re somewhat real.
Because they don’t know ex ante
what questions they’ll be asked,
I’m talking about the speakers.
Xi Jinping and other leaders
will know what the speaker
will say in the main remarks.
But then there’s a Q&A portion which
actually is real, it’s not staged.
That’s pretty scary.
If you’re some professor and Xi
Jinping asks you to come in and asks
you a bunch of random questions.
It's very scary.
So I think they are substantive.
And the thing is, Xi Jinping will
make remarks after such a lecture
and those remarks become policy.
You asked about the Leading Small Group.
This is where ranking is very important.
The head of the group always has to
be the most senior-ranked person.
Of course, the good thing about having
Xi Jinping as the head of a leading
small group is that his authority
won’t be challenged by anyone else.
Because everyone agrees he’s the
most powerful and senior-ranked
person in all of China.
The problem is, all the other members
of the LSG are lower rank than him.
Well not all, but before, when
decisions were made in the Politburo
Standing Committee, notionally the
Party and even the bureaucratic ranks
of all the Poliburo Standing Committee
members were equivalent to each other.
So
there were debates.
There were even sometimes cases
of overturning the position of
the Party Secretary General.
Historically, you’ve seen cases like that.
But when most of the decision-making
was pushed into all these different
LSG… Usually there’s one other
person who’s similarly ranked as Xi
Jinping, like the Premier of China,
or one of the other top people.
But everyone else would be these Vice
Premiers, ministers, or provincial
governors, who are definitely
ranked lower than Xi Jinping.
In no scenario will they debate
a particular policy with him.
At most, there might be one person
with sort of equal standing,
officially, with Xi Jinping, who
could voice some kind of disagreement.
But because Xi is so powerful, informally,
no one would actually dare to do that.
Basically, the whole thing, once all
the decisions got pushed into LSGs,
became Xi Jinping.
And it’s very hard on him.
Before all these meetings,
there’s a briefing.
Someone gives him a briefing book
and says, "Okay, this is what we’re
going to talk about. Here are the
policy options. Which one do you
want?" He has to make up his mind.
Sometimes I’m sure he
consults with other people.
But he has to be really engaged with
a large number of policy areas on a
day-to-day basis, because the decisions
he makes basically become law, basically.
It's stupendous to think about.
You can tell someone how big China
is—the population, the size of the
economy, etc.—but visiting gives you
a tangible sense of just how big.
You have provinces, each of which
has as many people as a normal
nation-state, provinces with
hundreds of millions of people,
40 million, and so forth.
One person will say something at
the end of a meeting that determines
policy for basically the population of
North and South America or something.
Does he say things at the end of
meetings, during speeches, that indicate
he actually has a good understanding
of these different policy areas?
Obviously, the official
speeches are very vague.
It’s always something like, “We will
make sure that we are robustly pursuing
Chinese growth while hewing to the
tenets of Mao's thought.” It’s never
anything specific or interesting.
But do we have any indication
that behind closed doors, he’s—
You don't think there's anything
specific or interesting, but if
you've read thousands of these things,
sometimes it's quite revealing actually.
I’m interested in what it
reveals about him personally.
Does he display any analytical ability?
Any sort of empirical understanding
of different policies, etc.?
Yeah, that is difficult.
I would say, because of his upbringing
as a princeling, for internal Party
matters of how to control the Party, how
to control the military, from some of the
speeches... They’re not secret speeches
but they’re more geared toward other
members of the Chinese Communist Party.
If you go to China, you can read
some of these, which I have.
He has a really good political nose.
He knows what it takes to control the
Party apparatus, to control the military.
Especially on economic issues, it seems
like some advisor gives him some talking
points, and he talks through them.
There's some sense of that.
On technology issues I think he cares
a lot, but only from the perspective
that competition with the United
States is a very important objective
for the Chinese Communist Party.
It’s for him personally, a
very important objective.
So he wants to win.
But precisely the extent to
which he understands all the
intricacies... it's unclear to me.
I don’t think he necessarily does.
But then, comparing him to American
leaders, especially today, I think
he’s probably better prepared.
Just because in China, the experts talk
to the top leadership all the time.
Yeah.
The advantage of the American
system, of course, is that, at
least in theory, it can survive
a leader who is not up to snuff.
Okay,
let’s go back to Ding Xuexiang.
So the Politburo has 25 members?
Yes, 25 members.
The Standing Committee has seven members.
This is the key group
inside the Politburo.
This person is one of those seven.
He runs the
Central Science and Technology Commission.
The reason I’m especially interested
in him is because any large-scale
AI effort that China would launch
would be under his purview.
Do we understand what he wants,
who he is, what his relationship
with Xi is, what he would do if
AGI is around the corner, etc.?
These are all very good questions.
In
addition to the Science and Technology
Commission that you mentioned, another
very important position that he
holds is head of the Office of the
Central Commission on Cybersecurity.
The head of the Central Commission on
Cybersecurity is Xi Jinping himself.
But the head of the administrative
office—which runs the day-to-day
operations of that commission,
basically a LSG—is Ding Xuexiang.
He took that position back in
2022, so he’s been steeped in
cybersecurity for a couple of years.
I think by now he knows all the major
players and some of the key policy issues.
His relationship with Xi Jinping
is a very interesting one.
He only directly worked under
Xi Jinping for one year.
When Xi was in Shanghai, Ding was
the very senior-level secretary
who would support whoever the
Party Secretary of Shanghai was.
He worked under three different
Party Secretaries of Shanghai and
supported Xi Jinping for one year.
For some reason, Xi Jinping just
trusted him absolutely after that.
It’s a mystery.
I’ve looked at all the open literature,
I’ve asked people in Shanghai.
Nobody knows why that’s the case.
Almost certainly, I think one reason is
that he was gathering a lot of information
about the other leaders in Shanghai
and sending all of that information
to Xi Jinping, to let him know.
Because at that time, the previous
leader of China, Jiang Zemin, had
a very big stronghold in Shanghai.
So Xi had to break that apart
before he could assert control.
Ding Xuexiang likely was one of the people
who sent all the necessary information to
Xi Jinping in order for him to do that.
But beyond that—lots of people do that
for Xi Jinping, truth be told—what
else he’s done for the big boss to
earn his trust is a big mystery.
But the manifested outcome is
that Xi trusts him a great deal.
In 2013, he was promoted to Beijing
to be second-in-command in Xi’s
personal office, handling all the
flows of data in and out of Xi’s desk.
That’s a very important position.
He became first-in-command
a couple of years later.
He took control over the entire
apparatus that governs Xi Jinping’s
day-to-day life back in 2017.
Now he’s a Vice Premier in
charge of cybersecurity.
So clearly, this guy is trusted.
His preferences for AI,
AGI... I tweeted this Davos
speech, which you also looked at.
I think it’s very revealing.
What he said was, “We need to invest
in AI, but we can’t go all out in
investing in it without knowing
what the brakes are. We have to
develop the brakes at the same time.”
I think that’s extremely revealing.
It’s very different from
the American approach.
In America, it’s all driven
by the private sector.
Except for one or two companies,
everyone just invests and invests and
tries to reach AGI as soon as possible.
For the Chinese government, they’re
very afraid that some actor—outside, but
even inside the Party—is going to use
it as a tool to usurp the Party’s power.
So they want to know that they have a way
of stopping everything if it comes to it.
For them, developing the brakes is just
as important as developing the AI itself.
What are the different organizational
milestones we should be watching for,
to understand how they’re thinking about
AI, and when things have escalated?
To add more color to this question,
what I expect to happen, let's say next
year, in terms of raw AI capabilities is
that we might have computer-use agents.
Not
just a chatbot, but something that
can actually do real work for you.
You set it loose on your computer,
and it goes through your email,
compiles your taxes, etc.
In five years, I expect it to
be able to do all white-collar
work, or most white-collar work.
That’s 40% of the economy, potentially.
Eventually, we’ll have full
AGI, even robotics and so forth.
As this is happening, how should
we be tracking how the Party is
thinking about what’s happening,
how seriously they take it, and what
they think they should do about it?
I think a couple weeks ago there
was a Politburo study session on AI.
I don’t know if it was AGI AI, or
what kind of AI they were discussing.
Should we be looking for a leading
group on AGI in particular?
Should we be trying to
just read more speeches?
What should we be paying attention to?
Thus far, it seems like it’s under
the cybersecurity leading group.
So Ding Xuexiang would be in charge of it.
There won’t be a new group?
I don’t think so.
Because for the Party, it’s the security
aspect of it that’s the most important.
There’s one aspect where it’d be great
to automate all industrial production.
China is already doing
a good job with that.
I don’t think they need additional
governing infrastructure
to allow them to do that.
But when it comes to applying AGI
or AI to governance, even to service
sectors—generating video content for
people, doing travel agency stuff—the
Party is very paranoid that some hostile
actor, outside of China—certainly they
believe that very strongly—or inside
China, is going to do something and the
AGI is going to take off, and it’s going
to undermine the Party’s authority.
So
what we’re going to see in terms of
institutional development is not at
the top end, but at the lower end.
They will want to designate human beings
in all the government agencies, in all
the commercial entities that are using AI
or AGI, to put their foot on
the brake if it comes to it.
But so far, after DeepSeek became a big
deal, the immediate reaction in China…
Very enthusiastic.
All the different big tech
companies—WeChat, Tencent—everybody
was encouraged to adopt it.
And they did.
They adopted it as fast as possible.
Xi himself met with Liang Wenfeng
and did a whole meeting where all
the industrial heads were there.
Xi said that they have to
accelerate technology in China, etc.
So it seems like so far the response has
been that the greater the capabilities
of AI, the more they’re excited
about it, the more they think this is
the beginning of Chinese greatness.
But you think that changes at some point?
No, they want to develop it of course.
They’ll pour a lot of money in.
They’ll try to give DeepSeek as
much help as possible, sourcing
GPUs and all this kind of stuff.
But I am all but certain that there
is one, or maybe a team of people,
in the headquarters of DeepSeek who
can pull the plug, if necessary.
Because there is such a team of people
in every major internet company in China.
What would cause them to pull the plug?
Specifically?
First of all, if AGI
started generating Falun Gong–related
content, and it proliferated very
quickly beyond the capacity of the
censor to control it, then they’ll have
to stop the algorithm from generating
new images, new videos, and so forth.
You were saying they can help
High-Flyer source GPUs and so on.
What is the mechanism by
which that would happen?
Suppose it turns out that for DeepSeek
to continue making progress, they need
all the GPUs that Huawei can produce, and
they need a whole bunch of other things.
They need energy.
They need data centers.
What would it actually look like for
the government to say, “Every single
Huawei GPU has to go to DeepSeek.
They’re going to get access to all
this spare land to build data centers”?
Who would coordinate that?
Would that be the leading
cybersecurity group?
Would that be somebody else?
It could be.
That’s interesting.
The physical investment part would have to
share power with some other leading group.
That would be a justification for
an AGI leading group of some sort.
Because building power
centers falls under the NDRC.
It could be under Li Qiang or
He Lifeng, especially He who’s in
charge of investment and financing.
But if Xi Jinping doesn’t want
them to share the power, then he
would have to give it all to Ding
Xuexiang and give him a lot of power.
He could just do it by fiat or create a
separate organization to make it happen.
At this point, data centers are being
built in China at a very fast clip.
I think they’re just using the
existing command structure.
There is potentially a
foreign aspect to this.
You build up all this cloud computing
capacity in the Gulf States.
Who’s going to be the customer?
Who’s willing to pay billions
of dollars to use it?
China, right?
So
then the foreign policy apparatus will
have to coordinate that, and so forth.
Belt and Road v2.
Exactly.
Does it have any end implication for
the progression of AI—who actually
ends up controlling these leading
groups, whose purview it ends up under?
Or is that basically a detail?
In terms of what happens with
AI in China, does it actually
have that big an implication?
I think it does matter.
You have some decision-makers who have
shown themselves to be not very good—even
politically not very good—but nonetheless,
for some reason, they’re trusted.
Maybe precisely because
they’re not very good.
They’re very dependent on Xi Jinping
and that’s why they get promoted.
The chief negotiator with the United
States, He Lifeng, the Vice Premier
in charge of finance, he’s well
known for starting and perpetuating
the largest real estate bubble the
world has ever seen in Tianjin.
I don’t know if you went to Tianjin, but
there are just empty buildings everywhere.
There’s this "New Manhattan"—literally
the size of Manhattan—filled
with empty office buildings.
He made that happen.
That ironically sounds
like a great tourist site.
Not because it’s real Manhattan,
but because it’s fake.
It’s actually cool to visit.
It's like, “Wow, this is great. But what
are you going to do with the buildings?”
In Emeishan we went to
this huge Buddhist temple.
By huge, I mean there would be this
structure with a shrine, and you’d go
through it, and behind it would be an even
bigger shrine that was hiding from view.
Then you’d go through that one,
and there’d be an even bigger one.
This happened five times.
If you were to drive through
this would take you a while.
But it’s new, not historical, right?
Oh no yeah, it’s new.
By the way, there was nobody else there.
It was me, three white
guys, and nobody else.
I asked the head monk, “How did you guys
finance this?” And he said, “We’ve got a
lot of supporters, a lot of donations.”
I don’t think so, yeah.
So then it really depends
who’s in charge of AGI.
Ding Xuexiang really is a mystery.
I think he has great political acumen.
He must, in order to
gain Xi Jinping’s trust.
He has some technical background,
but it’s in metallurgical forging.
But he’s worked in Shanghai for decades,
so he knows how private corporations run.
He knows a lot about
international trade, FDI.
If
you look at the people in the Politburo
and the Politburo Standing Committee, I’d
say he’s definitely in the top quartile
of people you’d want to be in charge of
AI, if not the top two or three people.
One thing I would say about AI
is that content creation is going
to be a big roadblock for China.
Because China is so paranoid about
the content that flows on the
internet that they put human beings
all over the place to slow things
down, slow the transmission down.
Now, if you have AI creating tons of
content, there will still be human
beings—algorithms and human beings—double-
and triple-checking the content.
They’re just so afraid of
subversive content getting out.
But it’s still been compatible
with them innovating and having
leading companies in content, right?
RedNote, TikTok, and so forth.
Not to mention WeChat.
And AI might be even more robust to
these kinds of sensitive content, right?
Because you can just teach the
AI not to say certain things.
Even if that were the case—even if
you train something that you think
is pretty good—they will still want
a human being checking everything.
As somebody who is trying to observe
what the Party’s doing, have you found
that using LLMs has been helpful?
If so, which model gives you the best
insight into what the CCP is thinking?
Yeah, I’ve been using AI quite a bit.
Both to code data—it used to be text
hand-coded stuff and now a lot of it can
be automated— but in terms of finding
out what the Chinese government is doing,
some of the American models are okay.
Grok is okay.
But the most helpful has been DeepSeek.
To me, it’s quite clear that
DeepSeek—which, of course, was first
developed by a hedge fund to trade in
the Chinese market—part of what they
really trained the model for was to
detect important policy documents and
meetings within the Chinese government.
Because when you enter the right
prompts—even not especially sophisticated
prompts like, “What is the Chinese
government doing when it comes to
AI?”—it comes out with a bunch of
very high-quality links, which is very
useful for my research. Immediately,
you get a sense of what are the latest
policies, what are the latest statements
by high-level officials. It seems that
DeepSeek puts some higher weighting,
let’s say, on this kind of content.
I don’t dare install it on my phone.
I certainly have collaborators who’ve
downloaded the open-source model
and installed it onto a hard drive.
I use the web interface
for some of my research.
Do you think it’s just because
they have more Chinese-language
data, and so it’s just better at
understanding the Party communications?
I’ve used Baidu’s thing.
I think the typical Chinese-language
models are more trained on social media
content, which will come back with
hits that are more social media-like.
If you ask about AI, it’ll talk
about how AI gets used in different
things instead of policy documents
and meetings and so forth.
So it seems, just from
inductive observation, that
DeepSeek is trained on
this kind of content.
So that High-Flyer can make trades?
Yes.
Because obviously, China being China,
government policies have a huge
impact on how different stocks do.
That’s often where you would find alpha.
In the old days, people used to call
up their friends who worked for this or
that ministry to get insider information.
But I think what High-Flyer has
discovered could also generate
alpha is to use algorithms to look
closely at these policy documents.
This
is going to sound like a naive question.
We’re talking about how the Party,
in the abstract, wants to maintain
control over every aspect of Chinese
life and the Chinese economy.
But of course, the Party
is made up of individuals.
Many of these individuals—Xi
himself—went through periods where
the Party had extraordinary control
over people’s lives, during the
Cultural Revolution and so forth.
They personally, and their families,
suffered as a result of this.
They’re educated people.
Many of them have been in industry.
These are not naive people.
Maybe I’m just projecting too much
of my Western bias here, but what is
the reason they think it’s so crucial
that the banks are run by the Party,
the AI is run by the Party, and
nothing escapes the Party-state?
So the Cultural Revolution generation,
a lot of people suffered horrendously,
including Xi Jinping himself.
Basically, you have two types of
lessons that people drew from it.
The first lesson is, “Oh, the
Party’s too dictatorial. China
needs to liberalize,” and so on.
You have a lot of people from
that generation who feel that way.
Many of them now live
in the United States.
Basically, they tried to leave
China as soon as possible
in the 1980s and succeeded.
But for someone like Xi Jinping
himself, and others like him, the
lesson was, “Just don’t be on the
losing side. In any political struggle,
make sure you’re on the winning side.
Because if you’re on the winning
side, then you can do terrible
things to your enemies.” Apparently,
that’s the lesson he learned.
He basically honed his skills and built
his coalitions—for the time that he
would take over high-level positions in
the Party—for decades, as it turns out.
If you look at the data, when he
was in Fujian Province, he spent an
inordinate amount of time hanging out
with military officers in Fujian in
the late 1980s and early 1990s.
You wonder, why did he bother to do that?
Most local officials don’t do that.
The military’s there, you need
to be nice to them and all that.
But he built a dormitory for them.
He even joined a unit, an
anti-aircraft regiment.
He tried to do as much as possible
with the military, because he knew
he needed the support of somebody
in the military when the time came.
Guess what?
30 years later, when he was
about to be elevated to Secretary
General of the Chinese Communist
Party, many of the people he knew
back in Fujian are now generals.
They are in charge of
important military units.
And once he came to power, he really
promoted some of these people.
But then lately, of course, he’s
been purging some of these people
which is really interesting.
He had a strategic vision about his own
career trajectory, and he pursued that in
a very determined fashion, I would say.
What is the main difference
between him and Stalin, in the
political maneuvering sense?
Because all of this sounds very similar.
I would say early in their
careers they’re very similar.
Outwardly, they’re very low-key.
Stalin was the bureaucrat, very
low-key, not flamboyant, not making
loud speeches like Trotsky did.
He was low-key, getting things done.
He was seen as a very reliable person.
This was a reason why Stalin was chosen.
As far as I know—I don’t know
that much about Stalin—it’s
the same thing with Xi Jinping.
His father actually belonged
to the liberal faction in
the Chinese Communist Party.
His father never offended that
many people within the Party.
Everyone at a high level will
have sort of screwed over somebody
along the way, but his father was
in the better category, let’s say.
He himself was very low-key.
While the other princelings were
fighting for good jobs in the capital
city of Beijing or Shanghai, Xi
Jinping said, “Oh no, it’s okay.
I’ll go down to the villages.
I’ll work in Hebei, in a rural area.”
Then he went to Fujian, which was
kind of a peripheral area, then
Zhejiang, which was slightly better
but still not Beijing or Shanghai.
So he got out of the way of this
political infighting, I think
in a similar way to Stalin.
Early on, he didn’t
confront people too much.
But once he came to power, he
knew—they both knew—what it took to
control the Party they governed over.
Basically, you form a whole series
of coalitions to get rid of your most
threatening enemy at any given time.
For Xi Jinping, it was this guy
Zhou Yongkang, who controlled the
police forces and the Ministry
of State Security at the time.
He was doing all kinds of irregular
things, being fabulously corrupt.
He was a threat to the whole Party.
So Xi convinced Hu Jintao to
join with him to purge Zhou
Yongkang, which was successful.
Stalin did the same thing to Trotsky.
And then, after the most threatening
person is gone, you form another
coalition to purge the next
person, and so on and so forth.
They both basically did that until they
achieved absolute power within the Party.
Yeah.
If you read the Stalin biography, so
many of the people in the early part,
half the people in the Politburo are
later going to end up in the gulags.
And many of the people in the later
Politburo had already been to the gulag.
I wonder if there’s a Trotsky-analogous
person in this story, somebody
who was a flamboyant speechmaker?
Yeah, Bo Xilai.
So he was one competitor with Xi Jinping.
But because he was so high-profile,
he never had a chance to
be the top leader of China.
And of course, Xi Jinping
made sure that he would fall.
And now he’s in prison.
And now he’s in prison,
yeah, his whole life.
His son is in Canada, actually.
He’s on Twitter now, on X.
I should reach out, honestly.
He’d be an interesting person to talk to.
Yeah, I think that would be
really interesting, actually.
Let’s move on to another topic I
know you’ve studied deeply, the
local government debt situation.
What is the newest there?
What’s your sense of the situation now?
It just keeps growing in absolute size.
Basically, China is trying
to tell the world that they
don’t have a high debt level.
At the central level,
that is sort of the case.
It’s still 60-70% of GDP.
But the reason why that’s the case
is because with a lot of things the
Chinese government wants to do, they
push it down to the local level.
But the authorization of local
debt issuance is still authorized
by the central government.
So at the end of the day, it’s
really the central government
telling local governments,
“Okay, you need to do this thing.
I’m not going to give you money, but
I will give you the authorization
to issue even more debt.”
So the debt level keeps
going higher and higher.
The one thing that has alleviated the
cash flow pressure, late last year, was
that the central government authorized
again the issuance of close to 10 trillion
renminbi in special local debt to repay
some of the higher interest-bearing
debt of local governments.
But that’s an accounting exercise.
It doesn’t literally decrease local debt.
It just changes it from
higher-yielding to lower-yielding.
Meanwhile, the overall size of local
government debt in China, I would
estimate to be 120-140% of GDP.
Woah, that’s on top of the 60% that’s
owed by the central government?
Yeah, so total government
debt is pushing 200%.
And the high-level way to understand what
this debt was for… The debt in Western
countries and other OECD countries is
often because you owe money to pensioners.
In this case,
it was just that they built bridges….
Yeah, they built all the high-speed
rail, all the beautiful infrastructure
that you do see in China.
More recently, it’s been
industrial policies.
For example, if there’s a new science
park for AI, the land they acquire,
the infrastructure that’s built,
it’s all built with borrowed money.
Then there are these startups.
The startups are partially financed
by some of these central-level
investment funds that you read
about in industrial policies.
But actually, the local governments
also have their own seeder funds,
which use borrowed money to finance
some of these venture deals.
For startups, is the fact that they can
get cheap credit from banks more relevant?
Is the fact that they can get loans
from provincial funds more important?
There are also these central government
funds, the “Big Fund,” and so forth.
Which is the bigger piece here?
A lot of it depends on your social
network and your connections.
If you’re a startup at Tsinghua
University, you have access to
private sector funds but also to
some of the central government
seeder funds if it falls in the
right category: semiconductors,
AI, etc.
With Liang Wenfeng, I don’t know…
Because it started out as a financial
institution, it was mainly private
sector money from financial investors.
But there are other AI initiatives,
especially more hardware-driven
ones, in the provinces, which are
seeded by local government funds.
Without financial repression, an investor
in China could invest in Silicon Valley.
They could go to Sequoia and invest money.
But because of capital controls,
they legally cannot move more
than $20,000 a year out of China.
They have to find domestic investments.
As a result, many of them choose
to invest in Chinese high-tech.
Or they
just put their money in the bank.
Actually, a lot of people just choose
to put their money in the bank.
And then the state banking system
has the deposits with which to
finance local government seeder
funds for industrial policies.
The crucial thing here is that the banking
sector is totally controlled by the state.
So you're not getting a true
rate of return based on what the
productive value of investment is.
It’s literally like 1%, right?
Yes.
The deposit rate is 1%.
That’s an insanely low return.
Well, the inflation rate
is very low in China.
There are a couple of mixed-up
questions I want to ask here.
You said if there were no capital
controls, these people might
want to take their money and
go invest in Silicon Valley.
Very basic development economics
would tell you that if a country
is less developed, it should
have higher rates of return.
People from Silicon Valley
would want to invest in China.
Why would getting rid of capital
controls make capital go the other way?
This ties into some other questions.
Why is it the case that the Chinese
stock market has performed so badly,
even though the economy has grown a lot?
Why is it that
they have a current account surplus and
they’re basically accumulating T-bills?
The pattern you should see is that they
could earn much higher rates of return
building productive things in China,
rather than accumulating 4% yield T-bills?
At the deepest level, I would say
there’s a deep fundamental difference
between capitalism and socialism.
It sounds very philosophical,
but I think this might help your
Gen Z listeners think about this.
For socialism, they
only care about output.
It’s like, “Okay, whatever capacity
we’re thinking about—whether it’s
grain production or metal production
or, these days, robotics—we just want
more of it.” So then the state can use
the state banking system, which they
control, to allocate huge amounts of
capital to maximize the output of all
these different things they care about.
But when you maximize output, you don’t
necessarily make money doing that.
Whereas capitalism wants to maximize
profit, which is the difference between
the cost of production and the amount
you can earn from selling the output.
For socialism, they don’t care about that.
But the companies aren’t socialist, right?
The companies are profit-seeking?
But because the financial system
is socialist, they’re forced
into socialist-like behavior.
You can’t go into a bank and
say, “Look, I make robotics.
This robot I’m going to make is going
to be highly profitable down the road,
but I can only make ten of them.” The
bank would be like, “This is BS." I
know a lot of startups don’t make any
money, but at some point, notionally,
you have to start making money.
Whereas the socialist banking
system basically says, “Even
if you never make any money, or
hardly any money, that’s okay.
As long as the Chinese government tells
us this is a strategic sector, and as
long as you can prove to us that you
can actually produce the thing we want
you to produce, if you never, ever make
money doing it, that’s perfectly fine.”
What is the sort of outer-loop
feedback, the thing that
keeps the system disciplined?
Here there are private investors
that actually care about
earning a rate of return.
So they’re only going to invest in
companies that they think have a viable
shot at becoming huge companies that are
actually at the frontier of technology.
If these banks aren’t actually
competing against real investors—
And it’s not their money
so they don’t care.
But it seems like this is still compatible
with many of the world’s leading
companies being developed in this system.
So how is it working?
This is where the bureaucracy steps in.
How would a bank tell what’s a good
company and what’s not a good company?
There’s a complicated system
where—for something like robotics
or semiconductors—there’s an
expert group in the Ministry of
Industry and
Information Technology.
They assess all these different projects.
The banks will literally send something
into them and say, “Okay, this company
wants to borrow $10 million. Do they have
real technology? Is this a good prospect?”
Then some bureaucrat—supposedly with no
financial stake in the company, supposedly
completely neutral, and I say “supposedly”
because in reality we’ve seen many cases
of corruption—along with an expert panel,
who again supposedly have no relationship
with the company or the bank, will sign
off on these projects or reject them. Then
it gets sent back to the bank, and the
bank says, “Okay, these bureaucrats say
your project is good, you’re good to go.
Here’s $100 million.”
But it seems to work.
Doesn’t this just belie the whole idea?
Central planning isn’t
supposed to work, right?
There’s selection bias.
We see and pay attention
to the cases that work.
There have been some
fabulous success cases.
By the way, they do not
include Xiaomi or BYD.
Those were mainly privately
funded at the beginning.
Same with CATL and DJI and High-Flyer.
Yeah, exactly.
So the success cases
actually are not that.
But there are some.
I don’t know all the cases.
Huawei
is one where I would say there was a
lot of state funding along the way.
So yes, you have success cases.
But there are so many failed
cases, billions and billions of
dollars just thrown down a hole,
basically, for the failed cases.
In fact, for semiconductors, things got
so bad that they had to arrest dozens of
people in the Ministry of Industry and
Information Technology, who were in charge
of approving these semiconductor deals.
They all went to jail because they were
in on a deal where some company submitted
a bogus project, got it approved,
took part of the money, and so on.
So
it doesn’t work very well.
Of course, you have fraudulent cases in
the US too and all that kind of stuff.
But the scale in China, the waste in
China, is a much larger-scale phenomenon.
And it’s all financed, as you say,
with this financial repression
which is basically a tax on savers.
So even though there’s no meaningful
income tax—it’s just value-added tax and
corporate income tax—if you factor in
the currency devaluation which is a tax
on consumers, and then this financial
repression which is a tax on savers, it
might actually be a meaningful decrease in
the quality of life of an average person.
Oh yeah.
You definitely see it.
For an economy that’s been growing over
5% percent for decades, by this time
you’d expect pretty much the vast majority
of the population in China to have all
the basic necessities: shelter, medical
care, etc. But you don’t see that.
A lot of migrant workers
are barely getting by.
Homelessness is increasingly a problem
in China, especially with the labor
market being so fickle these days.
Elderly care is pretty abysmal, very
basic level for a lot of people.
It’s not the case for everyone.
Some people get very good elderly
care if they worked for the
government or an SOE previously.
So you see a lot of problems the
Chinese government has overlooked.
This is why I say that they have
a goal of making all Chinese
people happy and fulfilled.
One part of that is the “fulfilled”
part, the technology part. But the
part about truly helping people
live a good life, they’re not making
as much progress as they should.
Just to close the loop on this,
sometimes we get impressed when
we see things like Made in China
2025.
The NDRC and
MIIT have these very specific
targets, like “LIDAR needs
to get to this level,” or
“We need EUV machines by
this year,” and so forth.
But your claim is that that part of
the system is actually dysfunctional
and in fact, the part that works
is the 5% that’s totally private?
No, the private sector
stuff works a lot better.
You have occasional successes
from the state-financed system.
I wouldn’t say there are no success cases.
But I would say for every success
case you see, there are maybe
even over a dozen failed cases.
Of course, you have failed cases
everywhere in VC, but the amount
of money being wasted in the state
financial system is much larger.
Going back to the local government
debt burden, there’s a world where
AI isn’t a big deal and there’s
a world where AI is a big deal.
If we live in the world where AI truly
causes huge uplift to economic growth,
is it possible that this problem
doesn’t meaningfully harm China’s
ability to compete at the frontier?
Here’s why that might be the case.
It seems like this problem is
especially affecting poor provinces.
You have the actual numbers,
but are Shanghai and Guangdong
in a good fiscal position?
And could they could keep funding top-end
semiconductor, AI firms, and data centers?
So China could still compete at the
frontier in AI, even if the poor provinces
can’t fund basic services.
And in the long run, if they get
advanced AI and that’s a big uplift to
economic growth, maybe they can just
grow their way out of the debt problem.
Yeah, we can talk about that.
I’m a bit skeptical about
that in the case of China.
But yes, as you said, some places
like Shanghai and Guangdong are still
in relatively okay fiscal positions.
But there are other wealthier
provinces with a lot of debt also.
Zhejiang Province—where DeepSeek is
located, actually, and also Alibaba and
other tech companies—has a high debt load.
But because they started from a pretty
wealthy place, they can still service
the debt without too much difficulty.
Actually, the trade war is going to
make it worse for Zhejiang Province,
because a lot of the manufacturing
and export firms are also in Zhejiang.
Nonetheless, the case of China is that
the financial system is geared toward
fulfilling the priorities of the Party,
i.e. the priorities of Xi Jinping.
So, even if they can’t do anything
else, they will do the things
that Xi Jinping wants them to do.
And AI, apparently, is one of the
higher priorities for Xi Jinping.
He’s held multiple study sessions,
had different Politburo meetings,
and Ding Xuexiang—one of his most
trusted lieutenants—is in charge of it.
So I do expect a fair amount of
resources to be devoted to it,
regardless of the local debt situation.
In fact, at the local
level, things are so bad.
But they just don’t care.
There are civil servants,
teachers, who are not paid four
or five months out of the year.
You’d think, “How can you
run a government like that?
Wouldn’t it just collapse?”
But then you have to look
at the outside options.
If you’re a teacher, a very low-level
bureaucrat, what option do you have?
Do you want to go back to
delivering food to people?
Or would you rather at least take six
or seven months of civil service salary?
At least you have healthcare.
At least you get a free lunch at
the workplace cafeteria every day.
People still choose to work
for the Chinese government,
even if that’s the case.
A lot of the previously very
generous fringe benefits and so
forth, that’s all been cut down
because of the local debt issue.
Still, they’re pouring a lot of
resources into national defense,
into AI, into technology.
What would a solution
at this point look like?
If you’ve already spent all this
money… First of all, why is it
the case that these investments
actually aren’t productive?
It’s not like it’s entitlement
spending where you’re doing it for
old people and at the end of the day
you’re not getting any return for it.
Theoretically, you’re building real
bridges, you’re building real airports.
So why aren’t they productive?
And then, what does a solution
at this point look like?
So it was very productive—I think
you noted this in the Arthur
Kroeber book review you did—in
the 1980s and 1990s, because China
lacked a lot of infrastructure.
But once you’ve built the first
high-speed rail between Beijing and
Shanghai… You build the second one
and then the third one and there’s
very rapidly diminishing returns.
Also, the population is basically
shrinking in China, especially in
a lot of cities in northeastern
and southwestern China.
You really don’t need high-speed rail
connecting those cities to other places,
because nobody lives there anymore.
Can I ask about this?
If the reason that the provincial
leaders kept doing this construction
was because they wanted to get promoted,
and they wanted to get GDP numbers on
the books and government spending counts
as GDP, even if the ultimate thing
you’re building isn’t that productive…
But the central government has had
a problem with this for a while.
They think it’s fake, and they don’t
want to keep the fake growth going.
They can see the local debt numbers.
Were these people still
promoted nonetheless?
Like, why were people doing this?
Who was the person who created this?
And also, a lot of these people got
arrested in the aftermath, right?
So they weren’t promoted,
they were arrested.
So what was incentivizing
them to keep going?
When you invest in a large infrastructure
project, a lot of money changes hands.
This is a big debate in my field.
Some people say, “Look, the more
you invest, the more likely you
are to get promoted.” My argument
is that it’s not the actual
investment, it’s the rent-seeking
that comes along with the investment.
You have to get a contractor for
cement, a contractor for this and that.
You get a big envelope under
the table, as a kickback.
That allows you to pay your superiors.
Let’s say you did a billion-dollar
investment to build light rail in a city.
You got a hundred million dollar
payout from all the contractors.
You can give your superior $50 million
to thank that person and increase
your chance of getting promoted.
So I would say that’s the more realistic
mechanism for linking investment and
promotion rather than, “Oh, good job,
you generated investment and GDP in
this city, we’re going to reward you.”
In fact, there’s really good
work by James Kung showing this.
When you do a real estate deal, you
can sell land cheaply to politically
connected princelings, and then they’ll
lobby on your behalf for your promotion.
Statistically, there is an effect.
If you sell land cheaply to princelings,
your chances of promotion go up.
I find it fascinating whether a
corrupt political equilibrium
can lead to more construction vs.
less construction.
The political equilibrium in America
today… California isn’t the least corrupt
state in the country, but the political
equilibrium is one where there are many
different factions who get their hands
into the pocket, so everyone’s not
like, “We need California rail to happen
yesterday because I need my share of
it.” It’s more like, “I’m going to get a
little consulting fee to slow this down
by five years.” So it's quite interesting.
If you read the Caro biography of Robert
Moses and you look at the strategies
he employed, it’s actually very
similar to what you’re mentioning here.
It was in every single faction’s
interest that the bridge that Robert
Moses was working on gets done, through
some of the mechanisms you mentioned.
For example, he would give the
banks these discounted bonds for the
construction so the bank lobbyists
were encouraged to keep it going.
The unions, obviously, wanted employment.
So they wanted the construction too.
Every single person at every
stage was incentivized.
So I find it interesting that China
has maintained a political equilibrium
that encourages too much building,
whereas our political equilibrium
discourages it.
Yeah, it is.
Basically, all the regulations in the
US—environmental and so on—build their
own stakeholders and lobbying groups.
Then it's in the interest of those
groups to prolong the process so they
can absorb a higher share of the rent.
Whereas in China, because they have
this command structure headed by
the Chinese Communist Party, the
secretary of the city or province
can cut through all the red tape.
He’s the boss of most of the
regulators at the local level.
So if he wants to do something, he
can cut through all of it, as long
as he can benefit himself somehow.
So I would say that’s the difference.
Okay and what would a solution
to this problem look like?
Because if the debt is already
over 100% of GDP, that’s tough.
Of course the Chinese government
will never, ever in a million years
do this in its current form, but it
would be to reduce a lot of the other
unnecessary spending: national defense,
many of the industrial policies.
And then to use the savings to
bolster domestic demand with welfare
policies and gradually decrease the
amount of local government debt.
That, I think, would
be economically sound.
China already has the
largest navy in the world.
Why does it need a navy that's even
bigger than the largest navy in the world?
It doesn't need that.
It already has more than
enough for national defense.
It has some of the best jet
fighters in the world, some
of the best missile systems.
No one is going to invade
China or come close to it.
So they actually don’t need it.
Now, on the tech race I’m
somewhat sympathetic to China.
Because now there are US policies
preventing Chinese companies
from buying all the chips for
AI, they want their own capacity.
They’re spending a lot of money on it.
So that part I’m somewhat sympathetic to.
But other aspects of industrial
policy—for some of the battery stuff,
for solar power, etc.—they could
certainly reduce a lot of subsidies.
They could increase taxes, actually,
on many export-oriented firms.
That’s one reason for the large
trade surplus in China and the
trade imbalance with the US.
They could get more revenue that way
to finance domestic demand and pay
down local government debt over time.
The Chinese government, of course,
will never do that because it places
a very high priority on competition
with the US across many different
fronts, and on gaining dominance
over multiple supply chains.
But in a world of global
trade, why do you need that?
The same goes for the US.
The US doesn’t need dominance over
every single supply chain either.
Yeah.
Why is it the case that when economists
talk about rebalancing more toward
consumption, they often suggest increasing
welfare?
It seems like the more straightforward
thing to do would be to get rid of
financial repression so that by default
savers would have more purchasing power.
You can also get rid of currency
devaluation to achieve the same effect.
Why not get rid of the
regressive taxes instead?
Because if you just get rid of
financial repression, it will
only benefit the net-savers, which
is the top 10-20% of households.
If
you look at the median household,
they have very little savings
besides the home they live in.
So there's this misconception
that China has the largest
savings deposits in the world.
That’s true.
But if you look at the distribution,
those deposits are highly concentrated
in the hands of the top 10%.
So even if deposit interest rates suddenly
go up to 4%, it's only going to benefit
the people with large amounts of savings.
Most people won’t benefit.
Most people, if they don’t have better
welfare services, will just save like
crazy in anticipation of getting sick.
So you do need better medical
care insurance in China.
Frankly, that’s something I
worry about in the US too.
If you cut back on Medicaid, it's going
to encourage precautionary savings.
You could say, “Well, that’s a good
thing. Americans save too little.”
Maybe, but then your short-term
consumption is going to come down.
So you mentioned a second ago, “why do
they need this big military?” Obviously
the reason is not just self-defense but
a potential invasion of Taiwan. Given
your reading of elite politics, what’s
your sense on the probability that they
would actually invade Taiwan this decade?
First of all, I think we do know
something about Xi Jinping’s preference
mapping when it comes to this issue.
He’s said a number of times that
obviously China should be united
and I do believe that’s sincere.
But clearly, his desire to achieve
that is not so strong that he would
take a very risky gamble to achieve it.
If that were the case, he
would’ve done it already.
He’s been in power for 12 years.
He hasn’t done very much.
Certainly the amount of pressure
on Taiwan has ratcheted up.
Also from his other policymaking, we
know he’s not a reckless policymaker.
Zero-COVID
was reckless.
Do you think that was reckless?
That was actually conservative, right?
He preserved a lockdown
longer than was necessary.
I mean it depends.
You could say the same thing about Taiwan.
It’s conservative because in
the long run maybe they pose
a national security threat.
It is a change from the norm.
If
he wanted it so badly that he’d
do whatever it takes to get it,
he would’ve done it already.
I guess you could argue that he’s been
trying to build up enough self-sufficiency
such that in the aftermath,
China wouldn’t be left in the
lurch without food or power.
That’s why they’re doing clean tech, why
they’re investing in semis and so forth.
It’s so that over the next
few years, if they have enough
self-sufficiency, they’re in a position
where they actually could do it.
You couldn’t have done
the same thing in 2015.
Right.
We’ve seen the Chinese government
engage in all these behaviors:
stockpiling oil and grain for example,
enlarging the navy, building amphibious
landing capabilities, and so on.
One argument is that there’s a threshold.
Once he feels he’s reached that
threshold, then he’ll go for it.
But for me, I don’t think
that threshold is fixed.
It’s really conditional on
a lot of different things.
Some exogenous factors might
increase the threshold.
Other exogenous factors
might lower the threshold.
More recently, one factor that
likely increased the threshold
is what happened in Ukraine.
That’s a case where Putin was
very confident he could take over
all of Ukraine in a short time.
It turns out he was wrong.
He was getting bad
intelligence, and so forth.
I think for Xi Jinping, he
cannot discount the possibility.
That likely increased the threshold.
But there could be other factors
that lower the threshold.
This gets to the question of how
much information flow there is.
How much true information
is getting up to Xi Jinping?
In authoritarian systems, obviously
there’s the danger that the leader is not
being told things they don’t want to know.
But you mentioned earlier
that the top leadership is in
communication with experts all the
time, in meetings all day, where they
are learning about what’s happening.
Is that your sense?
Because then you read about something
like Zero-COVID and by year three
it was very obviously a mistake.
So to the extent it wasn’t stopped at
that point, was that because information
wasn’t getting up to the top leadership?
There was also that famous case in
2024 where Xi asked, “Why don’t we have
billion-dollar unicorn tech companies
in China?” And people responded, “Does
he not realize the 2021 tech crackdown
is the reason?” Did nobody tell him?
What’s your sense of how much he’s
being told things which might make him
uncomfortable, like the possibility
that he might not succeed in Taiwan?
This goes to the question of the role
of expertise in the Chinese government.
That’s a very interesting question.
Frankly, I’m trying to use some data
to assess it, but my intuition is this.
The top leadership always
listens to experts.
Unlike in some cases in the US, the
experts are respected and listened to.
But there are interest groups close to
leadership, who know that, so they’ll
present different kinds of experts to
tell him different expert opinions.
Sometimes he’ll get conflicting
advice from different experts, and
Xi has to make some kind of gut call.
Other times, for political reasons
they’ll just ignore the experts.
They’ll never say, “Fake news,” or “We
don’t believe in science.” Sometimes
even though they know for sure the
experts are right, because of other
political reasons they’ll say, “Okay,
you’re right, but we’re not going
to do what you want us to do for now
for a bunch of political reasons.”
How did that manifest in Zero-COVID?
The timing of it.
Also the decision not to buy
Paxlovid on a very large scale
might’ve been a political decision.
We have a paper showing
that they knew the experts were
telling them the US vaccines were
better, mRNA vaccines were better.
But the Chinese government said, “Okay,
we believe you, but we still want to help
our domestic pharmaceutical industry so
we’re only going to sell the domestic
stuff in China.” That’s very clear.
If you look at the propaganda, they
began to denigrate Western vaccines
and highlight Chinese vaccines.
But I think they do
meet with experts a lot.
Sometimes the experts are manipulated
into saying certain things.
Other times, the experts are sincere.
They listen to them but they
still choose not to implement
what the experts recommend.
I guess I’m just trying to get a sense
of where this nets out, in terms of
the competence of the political system.
It seems like they have a track
record of making some smart calls.
But then occasionally they’ll
make a call so bad that it
wipes out all the smart ones.
Zero-COVID is an example of that
and obviously, the one-child
policy before that, not to mention
all the things that Mao did.
I’m getting the sense that
they’ll consult with economists
or scientists on some things.
I guess I still don’t understand.
They’re like, “Okay, we’re not going
to buy the American vaccine because of
this." This is the time of all times
to be making sure the pharmaceutical
industry in China is in a good position.
Sure but did they not know that
people were locked in their
apartments starving and that this
wasn’t a viable long-term strategy?
How is that compatible with this very
technocratic picture we have of the Party?
They’re technocrats.
They’re people who know a lot.
But generally speaking, protecting
the Party—protecting the state
apparatus and all the important tools
of the Chinese government—will almost
always be a higher priority than
any kind of technical consideration
in a given decision-making process.
Why protect all these
pharmaceutical companies?
Because they’re state-owned enterprises,
they need to survive the ordeal.
They need to have a national brand name.
Also,
pharmaceutical and what they call “new
biology” is one of these industrial plans.
In order to finance future
research in advanced biology,
these companies need cash flows.
What is the succession
plan after Xi is gone?
There are no plans right now.
What’s your sense of what would happen?
Tomorrow he drops dead.
What happens next?
Oh god.
That would be an issue, if he
were to drop dead tomorrow.
The
biggest impact is this.
Right now, financial
repression works because…
Let’s say you’re a billionaire trying
to get your money out of China.
You make up fake paperwork: “I’m importing
a million Rolex watches from Singapore,
I need to pay an invoice for a billion
dollars.” That order goes from your
bank to the State Administration of
Foreign Exchange in Shenzhen or Shanghai.
Some bureaucrat will have to okay
it, all large denomination outflows.
Right now, the bureaucrat thinks:
“If I approve this, someone in
Beijing is going to notice it
and I’ll be in jail in a week.
So I will not approve it.”
But if that bureaucrat thinks,
“There’s nobody in Beijing.
No one’s minding the store and this guy
promises me $100 million if I approve
it”, then he’ll go ahead and approve it.
So if there’s any sense that there’s
no command structure in Beijing, even
for a week or two, I think we would
have a financial crisis, at least.
That's interesting.
Because there would be
tremendous capital outflows?
Let’s put it this way.
With the foreign exchange reserve
people say, “Oh my god, it’s so much
money, $3 trillion.” Right now, it’s
less than 5% of the money supply in
China. So it doesn’t even take a panic.
Even if people just want to
rationally reallocate 10% of
their assets outside of China, the
foreign exchange reserve is gone.
There’s massive devaluation, etc.
They’d have to jack up interest rates
to something like 20% to stop it.
Then there’d be mass
bankruptcy, and so on.
But they can stop it?
If there’s a command structure, yes.
If people believe they’re going to
jail the week after, even if they
get $100 million in cryptocurrency
in Hong Kong or wherever.
Suppose it doesn’t happen tomorrow, but
in 2028 or 2030 he just goes senile.
Over the course of months, it’s
clear there needs to be a successor.
What does then the succession
process look like then?
There’s a way we historically
know doesn’t work, and then
there’s a way that could work.
The model we know doesn’t work
is designating someone: “You’re going
to be the successor.” That person is
going to die for sure, in a horrible
way. We’ve seen this with Stalin.
We’ve seen this with Mao.
The other way is to have someone
that everyone trusts to represent
the leader’s opinion, but who cannot
possibly become the number-one person.
Mao had Jiang Qing, his wife.
Xi Jinping could do something
similar with his wife.
Increasingly, we’re seeing his
daughter take on a higher profile.
The reason these individuals
cannot be number one in the Party
is because of this ingrained
sexism in the Party against women.
It’s also because they’ve never held
official positions in the Party.
So I think having a
transitional figure who can
stabilize the situation while
different factions fight it
out, hopefully peacefully, will
be an important ingredient.
Sometimes even those transitional
figures are too weak.
Jiang Qing was purged
within weeks of Mao dying.
Now the Long March veterans were
so close to each other that they
worked it out among themselves.
That was a pretty peaceful transition,
aside from the purge of Jiang Qing and
her colleagues in the Gang of Four.
These days, the Long March generation of
officials who’ve spent decades with each
other, governing with each other—that
generation doesn’t exist anymore.
There’s very high turnover.
The people in the Politburo, there
are different elements in there.
Some of them have worked closely together
over the decades, but many of them worked
in such disparate bureaucracies that
there’s not a lot of trust between them.
That’s probably by design.
Xi doesn’t want people in the Politburo
to trust each other and be friends
with each other too much, because they
might get together and usurp his power.
So given that there isn't this social
capital, the kind we saw in 1976,
I think this transition is going
to be more ruthless, more brutal,
and potentially more disruptive.
What are the important factions
in Chinese politics today?
What’s the equivalent of liberal or
conservative in American politics?
Historically, there were things
like the Shanghai clique.
Do those still exist?
If they do, what do they stand for?
They’re all beholden to Xi
Jinping in one way or another.
But do they have different ideas
about what should happen with China,
or what should happen in the world?
Generally speaking, you have some
people who are more pro-market.
These tend to be people with
more governing experience along
the coastal provinces, like
Zhejiang Province or Shanghai.
Then you have the statists,
people whose careers were mostly
in state-owned enterprises.
All the military industrialists, I would
guess they’re more pro–state power.
Actually, those figures might
ultimately be somewhat stabilizing.
You basically saw this
in the Soviet Union.
For those people, they just wanted
to preserve their vested interests.
So it was like, “Okay, whoever is in
charge, as long as you subsidize the
state sector some more, I’ll support you.”
In the Soviet Union after Stalin
died between the sort of Kruschev
and post-Kruschev transition, they
were stabilizing politically, even
though they ended up damaging the
Soviet economy by demanding so many
subsidies for their own sectors.
So the fact that you have quite
a number of these guys from the
military-industrial sector as Politburo
members could potentially be stabilizing.
What’s your forecast on Chinese
growth—or the Chinese economy relative
to the US—if AI is not a thing?
Let’s forecast out everything else.
In the year 2040, is it 2x
as big as the US economy PPP?
3x?
4x?
1x?
I think it’s 1x or 1.2x the US economy.
Even PPP?
Yeah.
I don’t quite believe in
these PPP calculations.
Oh really?
Interesting.
How come?
Just because the quality
is very different.
In some cases, China’s
quality is still worse.
In other cases, it’s increasingly
better than the US quality.
So I’m not an expert, but even
controlling for inflation—so real
income—I think the overall size of
the economy will be similar to the
US, maybe slightly larger by 2040.
But it’s already 1.1x or 1.2x, right?
No, not as far as I know.
If it’s not PPP and it’s just real income,
I think it’s around 70% of the US economy.
This is quite a bearish forecast.
Usually people expect China
to be quite dominant by 2040.
Growth rates were slowing down anyway.
Now you have trade pressure and so forth.
It’s going to slow down.
There’s no big consumption stimulus in
sight because of the high debt level.
So they can’t push growth
through that mechanism.
They have to double down on more
investment, more supply-side.
But at some point, is the world
really going to switch to 100%
buying BYD as opposed to Volkswagen
and all these other cars?
I don’t know.
I think there’ll be a pretty big
pushback, or at least some kind of limit.
Let’s say China takes over
most of Latin America, most of
Africa, most of the Middle East.
That’s still not such a big market, right?
Ultimately, you have to conquer Europe.
You have to take North America.
That’s going to be really tough.
Final question.
What advice do you have for me on how to
land—if not somebody on the Politburo—then
someone one step away from the Politburo.
That’s very tough.
Anyone who’s been a mid-level or
higher official can no longer leave
the People’s Republic of China.
There are some former vice
ministers who can go to Hong Kong.
So I think that’s your best bet.
Reach out to one of these vice
minister-types and agree to meet with them
in Hong Kong, or Shezhen even better yet.
That could be okay if
they’ve been out of power.
You think it could be an
interesting interview?
Or would they not say anything?
Yeah, it depends on the person.
Some people are willing
to be a bit more open.
But frankly, there is this atmosphere
in China where people are afraid of
deviating from the Party line, because
they can really get in trouble.
This was super useful to get
a much more tangible sense of
how the Chinese political
system actually works.
We talk about China so much.
Most of us have so little understanding
of even the basics, like the
Congress/president level understanding
of the Chinese political system.
Obviously a lot of it is obfuscated
on purpose, so I appreciate you
adding a lot more color to it.
Great.
Thank you for having me.
