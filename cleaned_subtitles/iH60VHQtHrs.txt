- Humans sort of think like engineers.
We think of what we want as an outcome
and how we can get there sort
of in the shortest distance.
And we may use some trial and error,
but we really try to minimize the error.
Whereas really
these evolutionary
processes start with error.
They start with a random change
and then try those things out.
And it's really hard
to get our heads around
how can all the diversity
and sort of seeming order
that's out there in the world
emerge from a process
dependent upon chance.
I'm Sean B. Carroll,
evolutionary biologist and
author of several books,
including my most recent,
"A series of Fortunate Events:
Chance and the Making of
the Planet, Life, and You."
[Narrator] How life works,
the staircase of evolution.
- So evolution, what it really
means is change over time.
So we wanna know how that
change occurs over time.
And there's two dimensions to this process
and it kind of works like a staircase.
And one process is mutation
and that's the rise in the staircase.
Those occur by chance.
If mutation didn't happen,
all things would be identical.
So you need mutation
to make individuals
different from one another.
Those mutations are genetic
changes, changes in their DNA.
If by chance,
that changes the property
that favors reproduction,
survival of the
individuals, it will spread,
and that's the selection process
and that's sort of the
run in the staircase.
Chance invents and natural
selection propagates
that chance invention.
And once that process has happened,
new mutations can then
be added on top of that,
maybe even changing the
character a little bit further,
and that's another rise in the staircase.
And if that's working
better, that's gonna spread.
And so it's the cumulative
set of mutations
and the cumulative process of selection
that takes us up that staircase.
So, that staircase
could have goodness knows how many stairs,
but it has to go through
this stepwise process
of individual mutations arising,
sweeping through the population,
new ones arising, sweeping
through the populations.
It doesn't go from the base of the stairs
to the top of the stairs in one jump.
And this is hard for people
to get their heads around
because they may think
about that first step,
and it's sort of hard
to imagine, you know,
how do you get something as complicated,
as individual organs like
an eye or a wing of a bird
or things like that, but,
time, immense time.
The speed with which some
new adaptation spreads
through a population
depends upon the magnitude
of the advantage it conveys.
If it's about a 3% advantage,
meaning that about 103 individuals survive
for every 100 that don't have it,
well that will take
about 1,000 generations
to spread through the population.
Now I'm saying generations
because it depends upon the
generation time of the creature.
So if the generation time,
for example, if humans is 25 years,
it'll take 25,000 years
for that to spread through
the human population.
But if the generation time is 20 minutes,
you can work it out.
It'll take, you know, 20,000
minutes to spread through,
which is much shorter.
It's a matter of generations
because it's reproduction
is a generation by generation process.
It's really important to underscore
that these mutations occur at random
without any consideration
of whether they're good
or bad for the organism.
It's the external conditions
that are gonna sort this out.
So some things can be
good for one creature
and bad for another, okay?
So for example, a color change might make
a creature more invisible
in some settings,
more visible in another.
Some mutation may make it better
adapted to warmer climates,
less well adapted to
colder climates, right?
So it depends on these
external circumstances.
So the mutations arise at random.
Well what about those
external circumstances?
What we'd say the abiotic conditions,
whether the physical world
that the creature is living in,
well that's also
generated a lot at random,
tectonic plates moving across the earth.
You know, vulcanism,
all the things that shape
the conditions of life
are often due to physical
processes of the earth.
Of all the many thousands
and millions of things
that creatures have come up with,
I have a few of my favorites
that I think really exemplify
this process of adaptation.
And one of my favorite sets of creatures,
there's some fish called Icefish.
They live in the southern
ocean around the Antarctic,
and they live in water
that is actually below
the freezing temperature of fresh water.
They're right around about
29 degrees Fahrenheit,
is the ocean around the Antarctic.
And that's a challenging environment.
So challenging for example,
that you may know that there's
ice flows around there,
and if little ice crystals
just get into the bodies of these fish,
they'll nucleate freezing,
they'll freeze like fish sticks.
So they need to have a mechanism
that prevents them from freezing
at that cold temperature.
And what they've done is
they've evolved antifreeze.
Certain proteins in their bloodstream made
in very large quantities
suppress the ability
of ice crystals to grow
inside their bodies.
And so they're able to
tolerate that subfreezing water
of the Antarctic and other fish aren't.
So what's happened over the
last 30 or 40 million years
is that a lot of fish that
were once swam in those oceans,
sharks and rays and all
that, they're all gone.
They're extinct from those waters,
we find them in more temperate waters.
But it's the Icefish and the
antifreeze bearing relatives
that exploit those waters.
And the Icefish have also
come up with something
that's incredibly nifty
and shocked naturalists
when they first discovered it,
which is if you open,
which any fish, you know,
slice it open, you're gonna see red blood
because that's something
that animals with backbones
have and have had for
almost 500 million years
on this planet.
But you slice open an Icefish,
their blood is colorless
'cause they've gotten
rid of red blood cells.
So they don't even have a mechanism
for carrying oxygen actively
in their bloodstream
like we do.
They've ditched red blood cells.
And the reason they've
ditched red blood cells
is that those low temperatures,
it makes their blood too viscous.
And that's a disadvantage.
To the Icefish,
it was an advantage to get
rid of red blood cells.
To the rest of us, it's instantly fatal.
So it's a good illustration
of just how conditional
these adaptations are,
that to exploit the resources
of the southern ocean,
you gotta make antifreeze
and get rid of your red blood cells,
where the other parts
of the world antifreeze
would be irrelevant and your
red blood cells are necessary
for every second of life.
Let's talk about speciation.
That process of variations
helping to adapt,
that's the process of adaptation.
But speciation is the generation
of two species from one.
What that take for there
to be two species to form?
And we know, and this is
where in the island biology
of Wallace and Darwin help,
is that they were seeing
species on different islands.
Well, islands provide some isolation,
and that isolation means
that those populations
aren't exchanging genes.
Over time,
each of those populations
will accumulate mutations
that exist in one population
and not the other vice versa.
Well, those could become
genetically distinct enough
that if those things
were ever to come back again in contact,
they may not be compatible
with one another,
and they'll be species.
So how long does that take?
Well, it's been estimated
for big animals like mammals and birds,
that works out to roughly
be about 2 million years.
But 2 million years is still a long time.
And you've probably heard, for example,
that there's now very strong evidence
that homo sapiens are species mated
with Neanderthals a distinct species.
And what's really happened
in the last few decades
is that for biologists,
that species barrier
has become much more porous
than we first thought it was.
In the old days, in Darwin's
day, species were characterized
as really distinct things
and we didn't think
there was any kinda shenanigans
going on between them.
But we now understand that it's
a much more porous situation
that for some period of time
as populations are diverging,
they can get back together.
And things that we humans
might call distinct species
can't often interbreed.
Another common question or idea
is that, you know, for example,
if humans evolve from apes,
why are apes still around?
Well, the important thing is to understand
that evolution is a splitting process.
So the family trees keep splitting.
So the human part of that tree
has had now its own separate history
from the eight part of that tree.
We shared a common ancestor
about 6 million years ago.
But apes have gone on living
as they do, for example,
in the old world.
And there's a great diversity
of apes, of course still here.
Baboons, orangutans, gorillas,
chimpanzees, et cetera.
While the human branch has gone on,
and has its own evolutionary trajectory,
it's not that evolution is linear
and that everything new replaces the old,
it's a splitting process.
And so that's why the Tree of Life
has just split into
enormous numbers of branches
from common ancestors.
Two of our main records of
evolution are the fossil record
and the DNA record.
The DNA record is largely
only accessible to us
for living creatures
and maybe some creatures
that have lived over
the past million years.
You know, do we have every brick?
Do we have every intermediate?
No, 'cause you know,
extinction takes away 99.9%
of all species.
So if there was no extinction,
we'd have a perfect record
of evolution, right?
We don't have the DNA record
of dinosaurs, for example,
but we've got the fossil
record of dinosaurs.
So we use these two records
to sort of reconstruct
the history of life.
That allows us to reconstruct
the evolution of things
that are fairly complex.
Let's take something like a
walking limb from a fish fin.
This evolutionary process transpired
over 20, 30 million years,
about 380, 390 million years ago.
To do that, we have to get fossils
that represent the various
stages of evolution
and see how did all the bones change?
So you went from a swimming
fin to a walking limb,
and the fossil record by
now is pretty darn good.
Then we can go to creatures
that have fins, fish,
and we go to creatures like
amphibians that have limbs
and we can figure out how do
those genetic programs work
and where are the differences.
Now we don't have every detail sorted out
and that would be
incredibly time consuming
and expensive to do,
but we certainly have the general picture
that we understand how the
bones changed in history
and we understand how the
development of program changed
to generate a limb in the place of a fin.
And that's not something Darwin ever had.
That's something that we
really only had for the last 20
to 25 years.
So evolutionary science keeps building
on this huge foundation
and what we get is an ever more detailed
and ever more confident
record of what's happened.
But what's at no doubt
is that this process,
mutation and selection,
mutation and selection
is the universal, going
on in every population
of every living thing every day.
In fact, this process of mutation
and selection seems so universal
that we think it must
have played a vital role
at the origin of life.
And that anywhere
where life exists in the
universe it's operating.
So evolution is this vast and rich process
and you know, we've been trying
to understand it for 160 years.
And in the course of that,
there's some misunderstanding
in just how it's communicated,
where I think there's some conflict
between the terms we scientists use
and sort of their common understanding.
And one of those is theory.
We talk of scientific theories.
Theory is much higher on the
hierarchy than, for example,
a fact or just an observation.
A theory is assembled from
lots and lots of facts
and independent lines of
evidence that sort of cohere.
So a theory is really
sort of the top category
of scientific idea.
Where of course, you know, in
the street theory might mean
that's my best guess
or that's just something
that I'm conjecturing
The way we talk about
those kind of conjectures,
we call those hypotheses.
And that when hypotheses
have been rigorously tested,
that's what can contribute
to making a theory.
So folks, when we speak of theory,
think that we're still very tentative
about the truth of evolution.
That's not all the case.
The theory of evolution,
which has grown enormously
in the last 160 years
is a huge body of observations,
evidence, and facts
that are consistent with one another,
that come from completely
different sources of science.
And that's what gives it its power.
Of course wish that maybe
that connotation of theory
that's, you know, more of
the everyday connotation
would be better understood.
