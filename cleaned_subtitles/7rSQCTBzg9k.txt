Why do modern people live so tiredly?
My whole life is a constant competition
Squeeze into famous schools and big companies
Compare who works the hardest overtime
Society has only one clear standard
If you deviate from this track, you will feel unsafe.
The book I’m going to face today is “The Trap of Perfectionism”
The author is Thomas Curran, a psychologist who studies perfectionism
In this book, he will explore where the pathological psychology of perfectionism comes from.
And the continuous pursuit of self-growth will actually consume yourself.
How do we fight against the various poisonous chicken soups on the market?
Moving towards a society where good enough is enough
The American novelist Edgar Allan Poe has a short story called "The Oval Portrait"
The story of a painter obsessed with perfection
depict his beautiful wife
Painting day after day
I didn’t even see that my wife was already sick.
Finally, when he finally finished his masterpiece,
Look up
Only to find out that my wife had already died of illness
Poe's life in the 19th century
This story is used to mock those who pursue perfection
in pursuit of perfection
Sacrificing time with friends and family
But now in the 21st century
Self-sacrifice and hard work will be regarded as an honor by the company
During the interview, show that you are willing to work hard for the company.
Here we first distinguish several different types of perfectionism
Self-directed perfectionism
Just workaholic, overzealous
Even if no one tells them to do it, they will do it themselves.
The other is other-oriented perfectionism
Demanding yourself because of the high standards set by others
For example, Steve Jobs of Apple set very high standards for his employees.
psychologists think
This kind of setting standards for others that they can't meet.
Maybe it's to compensate for the imperfections in my imagination
Jobs wanted to design Apple perfectly
But when it falls short, it will be vented on the employees.
So his subordinates are very disgusted with him
Think this person has a low personality
However, what the author discusses most in the book is
Socially desired perfectionism
It is a collective cultural atmosphere
Always thinking about what others will say about me
Afraid of being criticized by others if you do something bad
To endless self-improvement and continuous improvement
There is a saying circulating on the Internet:
<b>"The most terrifying thing in the world is not that others are smarter than you,</b>
<b>but that those who are smarter than you work harder than you!"</b>
Psychologists' research findings
From 1989-2016
among students from western countries
Socially expected perfectionism increased by 7.2%
we might want to say
Isn’t it normal to strive for perfection?
But research has found
Perfectionism is actually not clearly related to success at work
Staying up late studying and working overtime will not actually make you more successful
It just makes you feel more powerful
Psychologist Patrick Gaudreau discovered
The input time and output of work will show diminishing marginal effects
After working too many hours
Output will no longer increase
People who work feverishly are like over-fertilized crops
Fertilizer will initially be absorbed by the crop
Accelerate growth
But after growing to a certain stage, it becomes unresponsive.
Like a chef who pursues perfection
Processed food
As a result, the food was already cold by the time it was served.
in other words
Perfectionists are just ineffective overworkers
If the pursuit of perfection will not make your work performance better
Why over the past 30 years
But the average level of perfectionism is increasing?
German psychoanalyst Karen Horney believes that
This is because in modern culture
promote a kind of competitive individualism
This kind of competitive individualism is self-contradictory
On the one hand, culture encourages a high-pressure environment
The one who wins the competition is the winner
A good employee is one who makes sacrifices for his or her work
Everyone is competing to see who can work overtime later.
But on the other hand
Labor must be the majority in capitalism
Only a few people can reach the top of the pyramid
It's like the rules of the game are set from the beginning.
Most people are the exploited bottom class
Even if you work hard to climb up to the middle class
All it takes is an economic crisis
I can make you fall
<font color=#FFDD00FF>When we were your age</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>The superiors always tell us to work hard</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Then we worked hard and never thought about getting off work on time</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Not even a break</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Really hardworking</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Work like a fool</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Then the bubble economy collapsed, right?</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>Yes</font>
So Karen Horney said:
People in modern society "tie themselves to ideals that they cannot achieve."
people's efforts to adapt to cultural requirements
In fact, it brought more frustration to myself
This ultimately leads to people in modern society being prone to various mental disorders
Depression, anxiety, panic
American psychiatrist David Burns puts it more bluntly
"If you are a perfectionist, no matter what you do, you are bound to lose."
Beyond the culture of job competition
Another reason why people think they are less than perfect is
over the past 40 years
In response to the "supply-side economics" that pursues economic growth
Let the global marketing and public relations industry rise rapidly
We generally believe that there is demand first and then supply.
In fact, the situation is often the other way around
Advertising and marketing companies must keep people dissatisfied with their lives
Only in this way will you consume
Because if people don’t continue to consume
Product cannot be sold
The company went bankrupt
So even if people already have enough
Capitalism still has to find a way to get people to keep buying
Therefore, companies cannot spend heavily on advertising budgets.
By 2023
The global advertising industry output value has reached 1.4 trillion US dollars
We all think that capitalism can most efficiently produce products that meet people's needs
In fact, just the opposite
Capitalism needs to work beyond just producing products
You must also create desire for the product
People must continue to feel dissatisfied
And it worked
over the past 40 years
The advertising industry has changed people's desires
In the 1970s
When Americans are asked what a good life is
Their answer is to have a happy marriage and children
A fulfilling job
or improve society
But in the 1990s
The answer turned out to be a vacation abroad
Buy a new TV and make more money
< font color=#FFE500FF>Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct </font> <font color=#FFE500FF>Like so many others, I had become a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct .</font>
<font color=#FFE500FF>Hi, I'd like to
order the Erka Pekkari dust ruffles. </font> <font color=#FFE500FF>Yes. I'd like to order the Erka Pekkari dust ruffles. </font>
<font color=#FFE500FF>Please hold.</font>
<font color=#FFE500FF>Please hold.</font>
<font color=#FFE500FF>If I saw anything clever like a little coffee table in the shape , I must buy it</font> <font color=#FFE500FF>If I saw anything clever like a little coffee table in the shape of a yin-yang, I had to have it.</font>
People's desires are completely hijacked by consumption
No longer pursuing family life, a sense of achievement, a sense of community
However, American economist Richard Easterlin found that
After people satisfy their material desires
In fact, I won’t be happier
1940-1990
Americans’ incomes have risen sharply
But Americans’ happiness isn’t increasing
The actual situation is
Once a country's economy reaches a critical point,
If you continue to pursue more wealth
It will not improve people's happiness
This is called Easterlin's Paradox
all the time
Society promises us a better life
We must work harder to fight for the economy
But now economists have discovered
Economic improvement doesn't make people feel better
Then the author will further analyze
The pursuit of better and more perfect psychology
In fact, it can be traced back even earlier to family, education, and work environment.
We have previously introduced the book Reflections on Success
It mentions the ideology of "meritism"
Refers to society's belief that success or failure depends on how hard a person works
This was after globalization in the 1980s
A set of arguments that political leaders around the world began to tout
From Obama in the US to Tony Blair in the UK
They all strongly advocate the argument that education can reverse class
But today few people believe in the myth of meritocracy.
More and more people are beginning to realize
Successful people at the top did not get there through their own efforts.
Let's take a look at some data
According to a 2015 survey by Oxfam
Thirty percent of the wealth of the world’s top elites comes from inheritance
Thirty percent is due to nepotism in the political and business circles.
The rest of the wealth comes from investments and rent collection
In contrast
Many young people studying hard
Low starting salary after graduation
Or you can't find a job at all
Today’s economy cannot even accommodate the graduates it creates
Unable to find jobs for graduates
In this dysfunctional economic system
The pressure on students to enter higher education has become even greater
Psychologists' research findings
The pressure to enter higher education is actually more serious among middle- and upper-class students.
Because their parents will expect them to replicate class
Get into a top university
2019
FBI seizes a Varsity Blues operation
A company specializes in providing a service
Charging high fees from elite parents
Make sure their children get into prestigious schools
On the one hand, they send thugs to the examination room to take the exam.
On the other hand, bribery of university administrators
This creates an illusion: the child got into the exam because of his good grades.
Have the ability to prove that you can get the admission permit
Instead of parents giving money directly to the school
In the circle of prestigious American schools
There is even a popular form of perfectionism in which people who study hard should pretend it is effortless.
Stanford University calls this kind of people duck syndrome
Ducks look light on the water
You can't see the places under the water, but you have to swim hard
？？？
The psychological consequences of this perfectionism on college students are
Percentage of U.S. college students reporting anxiety to their schools
Increased from 50% in 2011 to 62% in 2016
In 2023, the proportion of depression among Taiwanese college students will account for 25.5%
This is not just because of meritism in society
In fact, it can be traced further back to the pressure within the family.
The author counted the past 30 years
Students’ perceptions of parents’ expectations in the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom
turn out
Parents’ expectations for their children have grown higher over the past 30 years
Because when the gap between rich and poor in society becomes wider
Parents also become more anxious
I hope the children will not lose at the starting point
Parents' anxiety will affect children from an early age
When a child doesn't meet standards
may internalize parents’ blame
This leads to a perfectionist mentality
On the other hand
Those who excessively pursue perfection in society today
maybe childhood
Not getting enough love and recognition from my family
These people have to constantly prove themselves from an early age
To gain the approval of family members
For example, the psychoanalyst Karen Horney we just mentioned
She was born into a German family in the first half of the 20th century
At that time, there was a serious phenomenon of favoring boys over girls in society.
When she was a child, all the resources at home were given to her younger brother.
This resulted in her having to constantly prove herself as she grew up
to make up for the feeling of being rejected by family members
As a result, as an adult, she became a famous psychoanalyst
But the driving force behind this pursuit of perfection
It's actually childhood trauma.
In today’s workplace culture
You can also see the ubiquitous pressure of perfectionism
In our parents' generation
The company values ​​loyalty to the organization
Do a good job and you can retire
But in our time
What the company wants is a role model for perfect workers
Employees must be flexible enough
Can work overtime temporarily
Always be available after get off work
For example, Elon Musk said:
No one can change the world by working 40 hours
If someone else works 40 hours a week
But you are willing to invest 100 hours
After that 4 months
You will achieve what others have achieved in one year’s work
< font color=#FFF100FF>
And then just work like hell.</font>
<font color=#FFF100FF>i mean you just have to put in you know eighty hour </font>
<font color=#FFF100FF> eighty to hundred hour weeks every week.</font>
<font color=#FFF100FF>(......)</font>
<font color=#FFF100FF>(The host is speechless)</font>
<font color=#FFF100FF>
it's a lot of work.</font>
<font color=#FFF100FF>Everything you do
increases your chances of success</font> <font color=#FFF100FF>That all those things improve the odds of success.</font>
This pathological perfectionism that pursues high working hours also pervades Taiwanese society.
Taiwan’s working hours have ranked sixth in the world
<font color=#FFF400FF>In statistics of 39 countries around the world</font>
<font color=#FFF400FF>No. 1 Colombia 2,381 hours</font>
<font color=#FFF400FF>Mexico ranks second</font>
<font color=#FFF400FF>Same as more than 2,300 hours</font>
<font color=#FFF400FF>Following closely behind are Singapore and Costa Rica</font>
<font color=#FFF400FF>Taiwan ranked sixth with 2,008 hours</font>
<font color=#FFF400FF>It is also the second busiest country in Asia</font>
The author also mentioned his own experience
in recent years
Western academic circles have begun to compare corporate business models
Carry out commercial evaluation
Use a research excellence framework to score output
To keep one's teaching position
Just produce endless articles
In the past, you only needed one or two articles to find a teaching position.
Now you need at least 4 articles to stand out
Enter the employment list
The school even started asking students to evaluate teachers
Full score 5 points
Professors must maintain a score of 4 or above to have a chance to be promoted
With only 3 points you will be sent to training
Scores below 3 may even be concerned by the school
These increasingly pathological perfectionist demands within the work system
As a result, more and more people are turning to outside the system to take on cases freely.
You are the boss yourself
Can work at any time and place
this seems more free
But in fact, I was forced to go by perfectionism.
Because if you can’t get a case, you won’t have money.
When a case comes, you must satisfy the customer
Many people even take vacations when they have no cases
I was still thinking that I should be working at this time
This feeling of guilt is the result of internalizing capitalism’s demands for perfect labor.
You must let yourself be a cow or a horse
to show your own value
So the so-called free acceptance of cases
In fact, you are not free to accept cases at all.
After the new crown epidemic in 2021
38 million Americans quit their jobs
many people are beginning to realize
If they are all low-paid
It's better to take the case freely
At least you can control your own time
The author thinks
This wave of job resignations
In fact, it is a kind of resistance to perfectionism in the workplace culture.
In recent years, a "quiet resignation" movement has emerged in Western countries
Like the lying down exercise in Asian countries
Praise for not putting in the work
Just do the minimum work
If I don’t do more and work overtime, I will die.
Emphasize that work is not everything in life
To take back the autonomy of one's own life
<font color=#FFF800FF>Working overtime? </font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>like working overtime?</font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>No, thanks.</font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>no, thanks.</font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>Midnight letter? Ignore it</font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>late night emails? ignore those.</font>
<font color=#FFF800FF>Nearly 40% of workers say they plan to change jobs this year.</font> <font color= #FFF800FF>Something like percent of workers are now saying they plan to change jobs this year.</font>
According to Gallup poll
More than half of the U.S. workforce are currently quietly leaving their jobs.

After diagnosing the causes and consequences of perfectionism
The author finally proposes a plan to combat the hegemony of perfectionism
First, we must pour out the poisonous chicken soup of spiritual growth.
These chicken soups like to say that various failures in life can be turned into nutrients for growth.
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most failures</font> <font color=#FFEB00FF>Some of the most successful people in the world are the ones who've had the most failure.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>J.K. Rowlings,. who wrote Harry Potter,</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>JK Rowlings,. who wrote Harry Potter,</font>
< font color=#FFEB00FF>Her first Harry Potter book was rejected twelve times before it was finally published</font> <font color=#FFEB00FF>Her first Harry Potter book was rejected twelve times before it was finally published.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF >Don't let your failures define you</font> <font color=#FFEB00FF>You can't let your failures define you,</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF> But let failure be your teacher</font> <font color=#FFEB00FF>you have to let your failures teach you
.</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Almost all successful people</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>After you get into trouble and make mistakes</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Always check yourself first</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>Hey, I didn’t do this well</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>I have to adjust it, this is wrong with me</font>
<font color=#FFEB00FF>A truly successful person must be someone who changes himself</font>
But this mentality of "it doesn't matter if you fail, keep pursuing growth" is actually not healthy.
Psychologist David Smail calls this "magical volunteerism"
It seems like only one person can say it
I am willing to stand up from failure
I will definitely continue to grow
but most of the time
In fact, we can't learn anything from failure.
We think there is some profound reason behind failure
But in fact
the reason why you failed
Didn't squeeze into a famous school or big company
The reason is simple
It is those children of the elite who have more privileges and capital.
So I took your seat
The problem is not that you are not good enough
But the design of this system is not designed for you.
Successful people like to praise their failures
Because in this way people will continue to correct and improve themselves
Instead of examining the problem of system failure
So what should we do?
Psychologist Tarah Brach advocates a Buddhist attitude
It's called Radical Acceptance
Radical means completely accepting that failure is failure.
<font color=#FFFF00FF>Life passes so easily</font>
<font color=#FFFF00FF>Growth means oxidation, right? </font>
<font color=#FFFF00FF>Really? </font>
<font color=#FFFF00FF>Anyway, I just don’t want to work</font>
<font color=#FFFF00FF>Don't want to work? </font>
<font color=#FFFF00FF>Very good</font>
This does not mean that people with low wages should accept low wages.
Rather, it is a positive and proactive consciousness
Recognizing the need for people to adapt to a toxic workplace culture
In fact, it is the root of the problem
What we need is not some toxic chicken soup for personal growth.
but systemic changes
Because the nature of today's economic system
No matter how hard most people try
There is no way to be a winner
It's like sailing a sailboat
Sometimes sailing into dangerous areas
No matter how skilled you are, you will always capsize.
The only boats that won't capsize are the rich people's boats
This is not something you can change on your own
Today’s capitalist society is this dangerous zone into which we are collectively sailing
So on a personal level
There's not much we can do
and must resort to collective change
That is, we are all in this dangerous navigation area together
Take some safety measures
That way everyone won't be capsized.
The author proposes three measures here
Worth our reference
The first one is
Let society no longer require individuals to work hard
Become a perfect worker
The economic system must stop pursuing economic growth
Because the price of pursuing economic growth is too high
For example, during the epidemic
The British government once asked economists to conduct a cost-benefit analysis
Calculating whether to close the city or not, how serious the economic damage will be?
Result calculation
Reasonable economic growth can be maintained if the city is not closed
Only about 50,000 lives will be lost
in other words
The British government is considering whether to sacrifice 50,000 people
in exchange for sustained economic growth
This is like the sacrificial ceremony of ancient civilizations
Mass human sacrifice
Just to worship a god that people are superstitious about
In today's capitalist society
GDP is the god that people are superstitious about
It doesn't matter even if a lot of lives are sacrificed
think carefully
Actually very scary
When society is still in the stage of development
Economic growth is indeed needed to lift people out of poverty
But now many developed countries in the world
In fact, it is already rich enough
But it also requires people to keep working and consuming
But if we want to keep consuming, we must rely on advertising to create a sense of scarcity.
Make people feel like life is never perfect
Falling into the trap of perfectionism again
So is it possible for us to move to an economy
Don’t you need to manipulate people’s desires in this way?
Economist Kate Raworth proposed a model of “donut economics”
Set upper and lower limits for economic growth
If there is too little growth, the basic needs of citizens will not be met.
But too much growth will exceed the ecological load limit.
If we want to avoid the collapse of the global ecological environment
Governments must start setting caps
In the future we will do another episode on donut economics
The second measure that the collective can change is to replace the lagging GDP indicator.
A country’s progress should not be measured by GDP
Because progress is not about producing more and consuming more
If Taiwan’s GDP is high
But it is obtained by squeezing labor and high working hours.
This just looks good internationally
But in fact most workers are unhappy
<font color=#FAFF00FF>Taiwan is also on the list of the top 100 richest countries in the world in 2024</font>
<font color=#FAFF00FF> The first place is Luxembourg, the second place is Macau and Ireland, the third place</font>
<font color=#FAFF00FF>Taiwan ranked 14th and performed well</font>
<font color=#FAFF00FF>Even defeated neighboring powers China, Japan and South Korea</font>
Psychologist Richard Layard pointed out
National public policies should take national happiness as an indicator
Only when the well-being of citizens improves can we call it progress
Therefore, the government should consider replacing GDP with
Change it to the Human Development Index (HDI):
Consider mental health, education level, and quality of life
For example, New Zealand and Bhutan have switched to happiness indicators
serve as the basis for national policy
We can also start with small-scale experiments in local towns
Like several cities in North America
Seattle, Victoria, Eau Claire
Experiments are underway to use happiness indicators instead of GDP.
If society no longer frantically pursues GDP
No need for endless work, production and consumption
Then the pathological culture of pursuing perfectionism will naturally disappear
But this will soon cause a problem
If people reduce consumption
Many things do not need to be produced
After the demand for production decreases
It means that some people will lose their jobs and lose their jobs
This is why governments around the world dare not really replace the GDP indicator.
Because this will cause a large number of people to become unemployed
shake the stability of the regime
So the third item can be changed collectively
It's about dealing with the unemployment problem
We can allow people to share the work load
Distribute work to more people
Everyone has fewer working hours
In fact, this is already happening
Many companies have realized
With the advent of AI automation
Employees no longer have to work five days a week
Can still complete the same workload
Many places have begun to implement experiments on three days off per week
Results found employees became less stressed
Improved happiness
And the work efficiency is higher
The company's revenue increased
For example, Microsoft's companies in Japan implement a three-day weekend off.
It was found that productivity increased by 40%
If you want to escape the toxic workplace culture of perfectionism
Reducing working hours and three days off per week are key measures
In this episode we introduce the psychology of perfectionism
Perfectionism has become increasingly prevalent over the past 30 years
But in fact
Perfectionists often lead to unproductive overworkers
Why people keep wanting more
There are actually many operations in the advertising industry and consumer culture behind it.
But to pursue unattainable ideals
In fact, it brings more frustration to people
People who pursue perfection excessively
Maybe it’s because I didn’t get enough recognition from my family of origin.
Or are they overwhelmed by meritocracy in education?
Or being poisoned by a toxic workplace culture in the workplace
To combat today’s perfectionism and the poisonous chicken soup of inspirational growth
We can adopt a Buddhist attitude
Radical acceptance of failure
There is no need to regard failure as nourishment to continue pursuing growth.
Instead, take failure as a sign that the social system is malfunctioning.
What we have to do is through collective action
Moving towards a society where good enough is enough
Stop pursuing economic growth
Stop striving to be a productive and perfect worker
Instead, use happiness indicators to measure social progress.
And shorten working hours and reduce workload
Let society no longer fall into the trap of perfectionism
