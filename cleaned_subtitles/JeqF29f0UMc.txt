哈嘍大家好
Hello, everyone!
我是莊也
I'm Zhuang Ye.
歡迎您收看莊也雜談
Welcome to Zhuang Ye's Talk Show.
今天
Today,
咱們聊一個非常沉重的話題
let's discuss a very serious topic.
也就是
That is,
加拿大人民最不想看到的
what Canadians least want to see—
美加關稅大戰
the U.S.-Canada tariff war.
是終於打響
It has finally begun.
接下來 不知道會持續多長時間
We don't know how long it will last.
我們的生活將會陷入一片混亂之中
Our lives will be thrown into chaos.
感覺整個國家
It feels like the entire country
彷彿被捲入了一場
has been dragged into
突如其來的經濟風暴
a sudden economic storm.
什麼股市暴跌
Stock markets crashing,
加元搖搖欲墜
the Canadian dollar teetering on the edge,
這不僅僅是一場貿易戰
this is not just a trade war—
更像是一場
it's more like
關乎國家尊嚴與生存的較量
a battle over national dignity and survival.
面對這一關稅暴擊
Facing this tariff onslaught,
加拿大從聯邦到地方
Canada, from the federal level to local communities,
從政客到平民
from politicians to ordinary citizens,
掀起了一波波的反擊浪潮
has launched waves of counterattacks.
今天咱們的視頻
In today's video,
莊也將帶著您 抽絲剝繭
I, Zhuang Ye, will take you through an in-depth analysis,
揭開這場貿易戰的層層內幕
unveiling the layers of this trade war.
不僅有震撼的實事剖析 前景預測
Not only will there be shocking facts and future predictions,
更有在這場風暴中
but also, amidst this storm,
作為加拿大的一名普通老百姓
as ordinary Canadians,
我們應該如何自保
how we can protect ourselves
如何找到一個讓你我生活如常
and find ways to keep our lives as normal as possible,
不用受到太大沖擊的實用生存指南
with a practical survival guide to minimize the impact.
您準備好了嗎
Are you ready?
下面咱們就廢話少說
Let's cut to the chase
直接開始
and get started.
咱們先看一下這周都發生了什麼事
First, let's take a look at what happened this week.
在美國東部時間2025年3月3日的星期一
On Monday, March 3, 2025, Eastern Time,
美國總統特朗普表示
U.S. President Trump announced
將從週二凌晨開始
that starting from Tuesday morning,
對來自加拿大和墨西哥的
a 25% tariff would be imposed on goods from Canada and Mexico,
除了能源產品之外的商品
excluding energy products.
徵收25%的關稅
These goods would face a 25% tariff,
能源產品他是徵收了10%
while energy products would face a 10% tariff.
同時特朗普也對中國下手了
At the same time, Trump also targeted China.
之前他不是說
Didn't he previously say
把中國進口的商品關稅是加征10%嗎
that tariffs on Chinese imports would be increased by 10%?
現在翻倍到20%
Now, that has doubled to 20%,
讓中國的痛苦加倍
doubling the pain for China,
就懲罰北京
as punishment for Beijing
未能停止向美國運送芬太尼
for failing to stop the shipment of fentanyl to the U.S.
此言一出
As soon as these words were spoken,
立刻引發了全球金融市場的劇烈波動
it immediately triggered violent fluctuations in global financial markets.
幾乎全球所有股市都應聲下跌
Almost all global stock markets plummeted in response,
美股三大股指更是首當其衝
with the three major U.S. stock indexes bearing the brunt.
包括匯率市場
The currency markets were not spared either,
墨西哥比索和加拿大元 也是雙雙下跌
with both the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar falling.
你看我們家那位
Take my spouse, for example—
週二早上一起來一看股票
on Tuesday morning, upon checking the stocks,
差點沒哭了
they almost cried.
之前沒有跑掉被套路的股票
The stocks that were already trapped and not sold off earlier
現在更加深度的被套牢了
are now even more deeply underwater,
還不知道什麼時候能回本
and who knows when they'll recover.
氣得我太太這個跳腳的罵呀
My wife was so furious, she was jumping up and down cursing,
罵南邊這位川大統領
lashing out at that President Trump down south,
你TM就是吃飽了撐的沒事幹
saying, "You've got nothing better to do after stuffing your face, huh?
好好的日子不過
Why can't you just live a peaceful life
你非得瞎折騰
instead of stirring up trouble?
折騰你奶奶個孫子
You're messing things up for everyone,
真的折騰到大家都吃不上飯了
driving us all to the point where we can't even afford to eat!
你才舒服是吧
Is that when you'll finally feel satisfied?"
當然我太太這這是氣話
Of course, my wife was just venting in anger.
她平時也是溫文爾雅的淑女形象
Normally, she's a refined and elegant lady.
這次真的 實在是氣的不行
This time, she was just too furious to hold back.
當然這個也不怪她
Of course, I can't blame her.
你要是股票被套牢了
If your stocks were trapped like that,
你罵的估計更難聽
you'd probably curse even more harshly.
當然不止我太太了
And it's not just my wife—
我估計屏幕前每一位加拿大民眾
I bet every Canadian watching this
心裡都是千萬個羊駝（草泥馬）奔騰而過
has a million "grass mud horses" galloping through their minds.
不帶這麼幹的
This is no way to do things!
你看你看
Look at this—
之前延期了一個月的關稅威脅
the tariff threats that were delayed by a month
並沒有因為加拿大和墨西哥
were not canceled despite
採取了很大的努力
the significant efforts made by Canada and Mexico.
而得到了任何的取消
Instead, when the time came,
而是時間一到
without any hesitation,
不容分說
they swung
結結實實地把這個關稅大棒
the tariff hammer down hard
砸到了加拿大和墨西哥的頭上
onto the heads of Canada and Mexico.
然後你再看週一晚上
Then, on Monday night,
加拿大總理特魯多表示
Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau announced
將對價值1,550億加幣的美國商品
that Canada would impose retaliatory tariffs of 25%
徵收25%的對等關稅
on U.S. goods worth 155 billion Canadian dollars.
其中 300億加幣的產品關稅
Of which, tariffs on 30 billion Canadian dollars' worth of goods
將於週二凌晨4號的早上
would take effect at midnight on Tuesday, March 4,
和美國的關稅同時生效
simultaneously with the U.S. tariffs.
而其餘的1,250億加幣
The remaining 125 billion Canadian dollars' worth
將在接下來的21天之內生效
would take effect within the next 21 days,
也就是下個月月初
that is, at the beginning of next month.
當然特魯多也沒有把話說死
Of course, Trudeau didn't completely close the door on negotiations.
但是在美國撤銷貿易行動之前
But until the U.S. lifts its trade actions,
加拿大的關稅將一直有效而且
Canada's tariffs will remain in effect, and
加拿大聯邦政府
the Canadian federal government,
和下面的省和地區政府
along with provincial and territorial governments,
也都在有效的溝通
are actively communicating
積極的討論
and discussing
在其他方面對美國進行貿易打擊
ways to strike back at the U.S. in other trade areas.
除了發表正式聲明之外
Beyond issuing formal statements,
特魯多其實也也說了不少狠話
Trudeau has actually made quite a few harsh remarks.
他就說特朗普這次的關稅
He said that Trump's tariffs this time
是一項非常愚蠢的行為
are an extremely foolish move.
其實在之前的一個月
In fact, over the past month,
加拿大為了避免關稅
Canada has been tirelessly working
一直在不懈的努力
to avoid these tariffs,
解決特朗普所關心的什麼非法移民
addressing Trump's concerns about illegal immigration
芬太尼的事
and fentanyl issues.
而且制定了一項
It even devised
價值高達13億美元的邊境計劃
a $1.3 billion border plan,
增加了各種新型設備
adding various new equipment,
比方說什麼直升機
such as helicopters,
無人機
drones,
還增加了很多的邊境巡邏人員
and significantly increasing the number of border patrol officers.
還同時任命了一名芬太尼沙皇
It also appointed a fentanyl czar
並且正在建立
and is in the process of establishing
加拿大和美國的聯合打擊部隊
a joint Canada-U.S. task force
在邊境巡邏
for border patrols.
目前據統計
According to current statistics,
在美國邊境截獲的非法移民和芬太尼
less than 1% of illegal immigrants and fentanyl intercepted at U.S. borders
只有不到1%是來自美加邊境的
come from the U.S.-Canada border,
幾乎接近為零了
essentially close to zero.
所以說加拿大這邊治理打擊的效果
So, Canada's efforts in cracking down have been
那是超級的好
extremely effective.
結果熱臉貼冷屁股上
But the result? A warm face met with a cold shoulder.
辛辛苦苦幹了一個多月
After more than a month of hard work,
本以為能換來一個好的結果
hoping to achieve a positive outcome,
沒想到換了一個寂寞
we ended up with nothing.
這說明什麼
What does this show?
這說明你加拿大做什麼其實不重要
It shows that what Canada does doesn't actually matter.
什麼芬太尼
Fentanyl,
什麼非法移民的
illegal immigration—
那都是藉口
these are all just excuses.
無論你做不做
Whether you do something or not,
做的怎麼樣
or how well you do it,
並不影響結果
it doesn't affect the outcome.
而且用特魯多總理的話來說
And in Prime Minister Trudeau's words,
特朗普的根本目的
Trump's real goal
壓根就不是芬太尼和非法移民
has nothing to do with fentanyl or illegal immigration.
而是為了讓加拿大的經濟徹底崩潰
Instead, it's to completely collapse Canada's economy,
從而讓特朗普
so that Trump
可以順利的吞併加拿大
can smoothly annex Canada.
後來發生了什麼情況
What happened next?
大家也看到了
Everyone saw it.
在3月4號的晚上
On the evening of March 4,
這個美國商務部
the U.S. Department of Commerce,
的部長霍華德.盧特尼克
through Secretary Howard Lutnick,
估計是為了穩定市場信心吧
likely in an attempt to stabilize market confidence,
就暗示美加兩國有可能就關稅議題
hinted that the U.S. and Canada might reach a compromise on the tariff issue,
達成一個折中方案
offering a glimmer of hope.
然後就給大家了一個希望
This gave people some optimism,
然後股票和期貨的市場
and the stock and futures markets,
也就是各項盤後指數有所回升
specifically the after-hours indices, saw some recovery.
然後在3月5號
Then, on March 5,
這個特魯多打電話給特朗普
Trudeau called Trump,
雙方進行了一次
and the two had
據說是非常緊張和激烈的通話
what was reportedly a very tense and heated conversation.
雙方都沒有好的語氣
Neither side used a friendly tone,
而且分歧非常的深刻
and the differences were profound.
估計特朗普那邊
It's likely that Trump
也肯定說了不少粗俗的言語
used quite a bit of crude language.
特朗普大概的意思就是說
Trump's general message was that
你們加拿大在邊境安全方面
Canada's efforts on border security
所做的努力完全不夠
were completely insufficient
需要加倍努力
and needed to be doubled.
而特魯多也是不客氣
Trudeau, not holding back,
指責特朗普
accused Trump
利用關稅破壞加拿大的穩定
of using tariffs to destabilize Canada,
你的目的就是為了吞併加拿大
with the ultimate goal of annexing Canada.
結果雙方談了大概一個小時左右
In the end, the two talked for about an hour,
也都是一肚子氣
both sides full of frustration.
談判陷入僵局
The negotiations reached a deadlock,
但是也不能說不歡而散
but it wasn't exactly a complete fallout.
特朗普還是做了一個非常小的讓步
Trump did make a very minor concession.
特朗普同意對汽車行業
Trump agreed to grant the auto industry
進行一個臨時的豁免
a temporary exemption,
把這個關稅
delaying the tariffs
推遲到一個月之後
by one month,
也就是4月初再開始實施
meaning they would take effect in early April.
後來
Later,
這個豁免的範圍有所擴大
the scope of the exemption was expanded.
除了汽車之外
Beyond automobiles,
還有對鉀肥的關稅
tariffs on potash
也是從之前說的25%降到10%
were also reduced from the previously announced 25% to 10%.
當然了
Of course,
特朗普做的一些小的讓步
these minor concessions by Trump
也不是為了加拿大好
weren't necessarily made for Canada's benefit.
他很大的可能是為了回應
It's highly likely they were in response to
美國的汽車製造商
pressure from U.S. automakers,
以及那些
as well as
不想看到汽車漲價的
U.S. consumers who don't want to see car prices rise,
美國消費者的壓力
and
還有一些美國農民的壓力
pressure from some U.S. farmers.
他這麼做
By doing this,
有可能只是為下一步談判
he might just be creating leverage
提供一個籌碼
for the next round of negotiations.
這個大家都知道
Everyone knows
作為談判的一方
that as a negotiator,
你不能只會討價
you can't just make demands
不會還價
without offering anything in return.
說到底特朗普他還是一個商人
After all, Trump is still a businessman at heart.
當然甭管他的原因是什麼了
Regardless of his reasons,
畢竟給加拿大安省這邊的汽車行業
this has at least provided a brief breathing space
提供了一個短暫的喘息空間
for the auto industry here in Ontario, Canada.
還有，這麼一個好消息
Also, this piece of good news—
但不算好消息
though it's not entirely good news,
只能算半個好消息
only half good news—
在這個消息的加持之下
with the boost from this news,
加幣也稍微回升了一些
the Canadian dollar saw a slight recovery.
但是你想
But think about it—
這種部分性的關稅豁免
this partial tariff exemption
對加拿大來說沒什麼用
is of little use to Canada.
加拿大汽車行業之外的
Outside of Canada's auto industry,
其他的能源和製造業
other sectors like energy and manufacturing
依然面臨著巨大的關稅壓力
still face enormous tariff pressure.
因此特魯多也沒有說
That's why Trudeau didn't say
是因為這一點小恩小惠
that he would ease Canada's retaliatory tariff measures
而放鬆自己的關稅報復措施
just because of these small concessions.
特魯多強調
Trudeau emphasized
除非美國先取消所有的關稅
that unless the U.S. lifts all its tariffs first,
否則
otherwise,
加拿大不會取消任何的既定關稅計劃
Canada will not cancel any of its planned tariffs.
當然加拿大這邊也需要
Of course, Canada also needs to
你看特朗普都稍微讓了一點步了
consider that since Trump has made a slight concession,
你這邊也得釋放些善意
Canada should show some goodwill in return.
當然
Of course,
首批300億的這個反關稅已經生效了
the first batch of $30 billion in retaliatory tariffs has already taken effect
這個動不了了
and cannot be changed.
不過加拿大相應地
However, in response,
推遲了原定實施的第二輪關稅
Canada has delayed the implementation of its second round of tariffs,
但這個推遲一下
though this delay
也就是意思意思
is merely symbolic.
話說在這份上
At this point,
實際上我感覺到
I actually feel that
美加兩國的關稅戰
the tariff war between the U.S. and Canada
因為雙方並沒有相向而行
is not moving toward reconciliation,
而是敵意越來越大
but instead, hostility is growing.
美國那邊也是
On the U.S. side,
高層各种放狠話
senior officials are making all sorts of tough statements.
你看
For example,
美國財長貝森特週四在紐約演講時
U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent, in a speech in New York on Thursday,
也表示
also stated
如果真的有人像特魯多那樣蠻幹的話
that if someone like Trudeau continues to act recklessly,
那關稅恐怕只會越加越高
tariffs will likely only increase further.
然後加拿大這邊
And on Canada's side,
你看也不是省油的燈
they're not backing down either.
除了這1,550億加幣的反關稅之外
Beyond the $155 billion in retaliatory tariffs,
加拿大還準備在世貿組織內部
Canada is also preparing to challenge the U.S. tariffs
對美國進行關稅挑戰
within the World Trade Organization,
同時計劃
while also planning
在本國內擴大失業保險福利的覆蓋範圍
to expand the coverage of unemployment insurance benefits domestically
並且準備了大把大把的資金
and setting aside substantial funds
為那些受到衝擊的企業和個人
to provide direct support
提供直接的支持
to businesses and individuals affected by the tariffs.
你看這個時候
At this moment,
再想一想
it's worth recalling
前財政部長方慧蘭的未雨綢繆的建議
former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland's forward-thinking advice
加拿大聯邦政府
that the Canadian federal government
需要為即將到來的關稅戰儲備資金
needed to set aside funds for the upcoming tariff war.
你看應驗了吧
See, it's come true, hasn't it?
這個時候是最需要花錢的時候
This is the time when money is most needed.
然後咱們再看一下
Next, let's take a look at
官方反對黨
the official opposition,
加拿大保守黨的黨魁博勵治
Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Canadian Conservative Party,
他是怎麼表態的
and how he has responded.
這個一想就能知道
This is easy to guess.
這個博勵治
Poilievre
向來是主張民粹主義
has always been a proponent of populism
以及經濟實用主義
and economic pragmatism.
面對著外來威脅
When facing external threats,
那肯定是不能服軟的
he's certainly not one to back down.
再加上
On top of that,
咱們上期節目我曾經提到過
as I mentioned in our last episode,
在特朗普的關稅威脅之下
under the threat of Trump's tariffs,
有不少人直接就把對特朗普的憤怒
many people have directly transferred their anger toward Trump
轉嫁到對加拿大的保守黨的身上
onto Canada's Conservative Party,
認為博勵治和特朗普都是右派
believing that Poilievre and Trump, both being right-wing,
都是一丘之貉
are cut from the same cloth.
因此本來民調領先對手20%的保守黨
As a result, the Conservative Party, which originally led its opponents by 20% in the polls,
在特朗普的神助攻之下
thanks to Trump's “helpful” intervention,
到了2月底
by the end of February,
民調基本上被自由黨追平甚至反超
saw its lead essentially erased, with the Liberal Party catching up or even surpassing it.
因此
Therefore,
博勵治在這件事情上必須得萬分小心
Poilievre must be extremely cautious in handling this matter.
說話的時候
When speaking,
一定不能讓老百姓認為
he must ensure the public doesn't think
保守黨跟特朗普是一夥的
that the Conservative Party is aligned with Trump.
因此你看3月4日
So, if you look at March 4,
這個博勵治
Poilievre's
針對特朗普的這個關稅的措辭
wording regarding Trump's tariffs
他是非常尖鋭的
was extremely sharp.
把特朗普的行為
He described Trump's actions
形容為
as
特朗普在背後捅了美國最好的朋友一刀
Trump stabbing America's best friend in the back.
背刺
A backstab.
at 12:01 AM president Trump
stabbed America's best friend in the back
my message to the president is Canada will fight back
並且主張
And he advocated
加拿大應該對美國
that Canada should impose
徵收規模上相匹配的報復性關稅
retaliatory tariffs on the U.S. that match in scale,
說白了就是dollar for dollar tariff
in other words, a dollar-for-dollar tariff.
一美元對一美元的關稅
A dollar-for-dollar tariff.
同時他也呼籲加拿大
At the same time, he called for Canada
加強國內的生產能力
to strengthen its domestic production capacity,
這個就跟他前一段時間一直提出來的
which echoes the slogan he has been pushing for some time,
加拿大優先的這個口號
“Canada First.”
是遙相呼應
It's consistent with that.
就是通過減稅
This includes cutting taxes,
加快輸油管線的建設
speeding up the construction of oil pipelines,
加快資源行業的審批
and accelerating approvals in the resource sector,
以對抗美國的壓力
to counter U.S. pressure.
說白了就是
In simple terms,
最大限度地
it's about maximizing
減少對加拿大消費者的傷害
the reduction of harm to Canadian consumers
同時最大限度地對美國公司產生影響
while maximizing the impact on U.S. companies,
把從美國收來的關稅
using the tariffs collected from the U.S.
用來對沖加拿大給美國交的關稅
to offset the tariffs Canada pays to the U.S.,
支持那些一小部分
and supporting the small portion
受貿易戰打擊最嚴重的工人
of workers hit hardest by the trade war.
這點上他的立場
On this point, his stance
就是跟特魯多基本上是遙相呼應的
is basically aligned with Trudeau's.
不過就有些新聞媒體據此認為
However, some news media outlets believe
這次面對特朗普這個外敵
that in facing Trump, this external enemy,
自由黨和保守黨是摒棄前嫌
the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party have put aside their differences
站在了一起
and stood together,
合力保衛加拿大
uniting to defend Canada.
這也是歷史上非常罕見的
This is seen as very rare in history
非常值得鼓勵
and highly commendable.
這種說法
This view,
其實我個人認為
in my personal opinion,
也是大家想多了
is a bit of an overstatement.
當然面對外敵不假
Of course, it's true they are facing an external enemy,
但是所說的一致對外
but the so-called united front
目前我沒看到
is something I haven't seen yet.
保守黨和自由黨這兩個黨派
The Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, these two parties,
還是各打各的
are still doing their own thing,
自說自話
each saying their own piece.
不過在徵收報復性關稅
However, when it comes to imposing retaliatory tariffs
和批評特朗普這兩方面
and criticizing Trump, on these two fronts,
態度是一致的
their attitudes are aligned.
但是雖說一致
But even though they are aligned,
兩黨之間
between the two parties,
這個相互之間的政治攻擊
the political attacks on each other
並沒有絲毫減少
have not diminished in the slightest.
你看 碳稅卡尼的這個廣告還在
For example, the carbon tax Carney ad is still running,
自由黨又新出了一個新的廣告
and the Liberal Party has released a new ad
就是攻擊博勵治的
attacking Poilievre,
就說他將會消減社會福利
claiming he will cut social welfare programs.
最近也是在電視上能看到
You can see it on TV recently.
因此說
So,
這個博勵治
Poilievre
他是絲毫不想讓人們把他跟特魯多
absolutely does not want people to associate him with Trudeau,
聯繫到一起
even if
即使跟自由黨一樣
he, like the Liberal Party,
反對關稅
opposes the tariffs.
博勵治還不忘記順便攻擊特魯多一把
Poilievre still doesn't miss a chance to take a swipe at Trudeau,
說特朗普的關稅
saying that Trump's tariffs
歸因于自由黨的無能
are a result of the Liberal Party's incompetence.
但是當然
But of course,
博勵治也不能攻擊的太過分
Poilievre can't attack too harshly,
畢竟現在是自由黨在領導大家對抗
since it's currently the Liberal Party leading the fight,
過多內鬥引起選民的反感就不好了
and too much infighting could turn off voters.
因此保守黨的大原則是
Therefore, the Conservative Party's overarching principle is
保守黨支持自由黨對美鬥爭
that the Conservative Party supports the Liberal Party's fight against the U.S.
但是
However,
不支持自由黨對美鬥爭的具體細節
it does not support the specific details of the Liberal Party's fight against the U.S.,
更是不支持 特魯多領導之下的 對美鬥爭
let alone the fight against the U.S. under Trudeau's leadership.
所以說
So,
他這裡面的關係拿捏的非常微妙
the dynamics here are handled very delicately.
好 咱們說完聯邦層面
Alright, having covered the federal level,
再看一下省政府這個層面
let's take a look at the provincial government level.
這個層面比較簡單
This level is relatively straightforward.
幾乎是一邊倒的批評特朗普倒行逆施
It's almost unanimously critical of Trump's reckless actions.
加拿大的10個省三個區
Canada's 10 provinces and three territories
被聯邦政府組織起來開了個會
were organized by the federal government to hold a meeting,
然後做出了幾乎一致的回應
and they made an almost unanimous response.
主要是三大舉措
It mainly involves three major measures.
第一個 對特朗普進行譴責
First, condemning Trump.
第二個
Second,
在省內下架所有的美國酒類產品
removing all American alcoholic products from shelves within the provinces,
尤其是來自美國紅州的酒類產品
especially those from U.S. red states,
全都下架
completely pulling them off the shelves,
並且
and
停止向餐館和零售商批發這些產品
halting the wholesale distribution of these products to restaurants and retailers.
第三個就是限制美國公司
Third, restricting U.S. companies
競標省級公共事業的採購合同
from bidding on provincial public utility procurement contracts.
如果是已經簽訂的合同
For contracts that have already been signed,
全部暫停
they will all be suspended.
好 三大舉措 就是各個省的共同應對方案
Alright, these three measures are the collective response plan of the provinces.
然後各個省自己
Then, each province
還有各自的具體應對措施
also has its own specific response measures.
這裡面最高調的
The most vocal among them
就是安省的省長福特
is Ontario Premier Doug Ford.
這個安省很好理解
Ontario's situation is easy to understand.
安省的GDP排名加拿大第一
Ontario's GDP ranks first in Canada,
人口也是最多的
it has the largest population,
經濟最發達
and it's the most economically developed.
因此說
Therefore,
安省也是這次關稅中最大的受害者
Ontario is also the biggest victim of these tariffs.
不過 同樣是因為經濟發達
However, precisely because of its economic strength,
安省手裡面能打出來的牌也多一些
Ontario also has more cards to play.
你看省長福特的
Look at Premier Ford's
表態就非常有代表性
statement, which is very representative.
他說 面對美國關稅
He said, in the face of U.S. tariffs,
安省什麼都做的出來
Ontario is capable of doing anything,
包括
including
他會微笑著切斷對美國的電力出口
cutting off electricity exports to the U.S. with a smile.
這個福特還真不是開玩笑
And Ford isn't joking.
目前美國這邊除了德州之外
Currently, aside from Texas,
美國所有的電網
all U.S. power grids
都跟加拿大的各省相連
are interconnected with Canadian provinces.
其中紐約州 密执安州 和明尼蘇達州
Among them, New York State, Michigan, and Minnesota
是安省電力出口的
are the top three U.S. customers
最大的三個美國客戶
for Ontario's electricity exports.
2022年 加拿大對美國的賣電收入
In 2022, Canada's revenue from electricity sales to the U.S.
高達58億美元
reached as high as $5.8 billion,
其中最大頭的 就是魁省和安省
with the largest contributions coming from Quebec and Ontario.
但是 福特說切斷
But Ford's talk of cutting off
只是一個恐嚇
is just a threat.
他目前考慮的是第一步更務實的
What he's currently considering as a more practical first step
就是對電力出口徵收25%的附加稅
is imposing a 25% surcharge on electricity exports.
另外
Additionally,
安省也是美國關鍵原材料的提供商
Ontario is also a supplier of key raw materials to the U.S.
福特就表示
Ford stated
他將停止向美國交付那個鎳
that he would halt the delivery of nickel to the U.S.,
因為美國使用的50%的鎳都是來自安省
because 50% of the nickel used in the U.S. comes from Ontario.
如果這個東西沒了
If this supply were cut off,
直接就可以讓美國的很多製造業
it could directly cause many U.S. manufacturing industries
關門
to shut down.
福特舉了一個例子 說沒有鎳的話
Ford gave an example, saying that without nickel,
密执安州的汽車廠
auto plants in Michigan
可能會在一週之內關閉
could close within a week.
這還沒完
And that's not all.
福特還透露
Ford also revealed
安省將撕毀與埃隆.馬斯克的Starlink公司
that Ontario would tear up a $100 million contract
簽訂的價值1億加幣的合同
with Elon Musk's Starlink company.
他原話是這麼說的
His exact words were:
我們將不會把合同
“We will not award contracts
授予那些支持和鼓勵
to those who support and encourage
對我們省和我們國家
economic attacks
進行經濟攻擊的人
on our province and our country.”
你看 安省還是挺給力的
See, Ontario is quite formidable.
除了安省
Besides Ontario,
在加拿大GDP排名第二的
the province with the second-highest GDP in Canada,
這個魁北克省
Quebec,
反應也比較激烈
has also reacted quite strongly.
魁省的省長
Quebec Premier
弗朗索瓦.勒高
François Legault,
除了強烈譴責特朗普的關稅之外
in addition to strongly condemning Trump's tariffs,
他還提醒媒體
also reminded the media
關稅可能在未來幾個月內
that the tariffs could, in the coming months,
對魁北克造成嚴重的經濟打擊
cause severe economic damage to Quebec,
將會失去
potentially leading to the loss of
高達16萬個工作崗位
up to 160,000 jobs.
而且
Moreover,
現在已經開始對魁省構成生存威脅了
it has already begun to pose an existential threat to Quebec,
已經有工人失業了
with workers already losing their jobs.
巴西的一家
A Brazilian
鋁電纜製造商Alubar Metal
aluminum cable manufacturer, Alubar Metal,
已經因為關稅
has already, due to the tariffs,
停止了它位於魁省工廠的生產
halted production at its factory in Quebec.
但是截止到現在為止
However, as of now,
魁省還沒有出台更進一步的對策
Quebec has not yet introduced further countermeasures.
不過省長弗朗索瓦.勒高強調
But Premier François Legault emphasized
所有的對策都是有可能被積極討論的
that all countermeasures are open to active discussion,
包括對美國威脅最大的魁省電力出口
including Quebec's electricity exports, which pose the greatest threat to the U.S.
這個其實跟安省的對策
This is actually
基本上是一致的
basically consistent with Ontario's countermeasures
也是遙相呼應
and echoes them.
同時
At the same time,
勒高也呼籲魁省的民眾購買國貨
Legault also called on Quebec residents to buy domestic products,
尤其是要購買魁省本地產品
especially locally made Quebec products,
以加強魁省的經濟韌性
to strengthen Quebec's economic resilience.
不過這次特朗普的關稅戰
However, this tariff war initiated by Trump
倒是為加拿大內部團結
has, to some extent, fostered internal unity in Canada.
你看這個魁省的法裔自治問題
Take the issue of Quebec's Francophone autonomy, for example,
向來是加拿大國內
which has always been
最不穩定的一個政治痛點
one of the most unstable political pain points in Canada.
結果沒想到
But unexpectedly,
在面對外部威脅的時候
when faced with external threats,
在面對著經濟打擊和失業恐懼面前
and in the face of economic blows and fears of unemployment,
魁北克人對獨立自治的野心
Quebeckers' ambitions for independence and autonomy
是戛然中止
have come to an abrupt halt.
關鍵時刻
At this critical moment,
選擇了跟加拿大聯邦政府
they chose to stand with the Canadian federal government
和全體加拿大人民
and all Canadian people,
站在一起
standing united
抱團取暖
to weather the storm together.
你看 平時在魁省有相當影響力的
Take, for example, the separatist forces in Quebec,
這個魁獨勢力
which usually hold significant influence in the province.
這次
This time,
也都紛紛表達了團結抗美的意思
they have all expressed intentions to unite against the U.S.
你看 又是特朗普的神助攻
See, another “helpful” assist from Trump.
除了安省魁省
Besides Ontario and Quebec,
另外還有一個省 咱們不得不說
there's another province we must mention,
那就是
and that is
在加拿大GDP排名第三的阿爾伯塔省
Alberta, which ranks third in Canada in terms of GDP.
省長丹尼爾.史密斯
Premier Danielle Smith
就強烈批評特朗普的關稅
strongly criticized Trump's tariffs,
是對加拿大人和阿爾伯塔人的
calling them an unjust economic attack
無理的經濟攻擊
on Canadians and Albertans.
並且
And
她也同時表達了一個沮喪之情
she also expressed frustration,
說關稅戰沒有贏家
saying that there are no winners in a tariff war,
而且還說
and adding that
我們已經為了滿足美國的邊境安全
we have already made significant efforts to meet U.S. border security demands,
做了很大的努力
but despite that,
結果美國還是不顧一切的
the U.S. has recklessly
給加拿大徵收關稅
imposed tariffs on Canada.
她表示深感失望
She expressed deep disappointment.
雖說對加拿大的石油產品
Although the tariffs on Canadian oil products
只是增加了10%的關稅
were only increased by 10%,
低於其他商品的25%
lower than the 25% on other goods,
但是也對阿省造成了很大的打擊
it has still dealt a significant blow to Alberta.
每年估計損失130億加幣左右
It's estimated to cause an annual loss of about $13 billion CAD,
外加52億加幣的赤字增長
plus an additional $5.2 billion CAD in deficit growth,
再加上潛在的失業率的大幅上升
not to mention the potential sharp rise in unemployment.
對阿省的打擊其實也是很挺狠的
The blow to Alberta is actually quite severe.
因此必須得還擊
Therefore, a counterattack is necessary.
必須要讓特朗普知道
Trump must be made to understand
阿爾伯塔也不是吃素的
that Alberta is not to be trifled with.
首先這個史密斯省長
First, Premier Smith
就是支持特魯多的報復性關稅計劃
supports Trudeau's retaliatory tariff plan
也承諾與聯邦政府和其他省份合作
and has pledged to cooperate with the federal government and other provinces
下架美國酒類產品
in removing U.S. alcoholic products from shelves
限制美國公司參與省級採購計劃
and restricting U.S. companies from participating in provincial procurement programs.
這些跟其他省都是一致的
These measures are consistent with those of other provinces.
但是
However,
談到阿省能否像其他省一樣
when it comes to whether Alberta can, like other provinces,
祭出自己的獨特法寶
deploy its own unique trump card
猛錘特朗普
to hit Trump hard,
比方說....給美國斷油
such as cutting off oil to the U.S.,
別閙 那怎麼可能
don't be ridiculous—that's impossible.
你想多了
You're overthinking it.
譴責歸譴責
Condemnation is one thing,
一致行動歸一致行動
and coordinated action is another,
但是阿省在斷油這一塊
but when it comes to cutting off oil,
是非常的謹慎
Alberta is extremely cautious.
史密斯省長認為
Premier Smith believes
斷油對阿省造成的損害
that cutting off oil would cause harm to Alberta
跟安省那邊消減對美國電力出口
far greater than the harm Ontario would face
對安省造成的損害
by reducing electricity exports to the U.S.
這二者不在一個數量級上
The two are not even on the same scale.
因為阿省，你看
Because in Alberta, you see,
97%的石油產品的出口是依賴美國
97% of its oil product exports depend on the U.S.
2023年 加拿大對美國能源出口的87%
In 2023, 87% of Canada's energy exports to the U.S.
都是來自阿省的
came from Alberta.
這咱們打一個形象的比方
Let's use a vivid analogy:
安省給美國斷電
If Ontario cuts off electricity to the U.S.,
安省也就是相當於砍下來一個胳膊
it's like Ontario cutting off an arm—it can still survive.
還能活 阿省要是給美國斷油的話
But if Alberta cuts off oil to the U.S.,
就相當於直接把腦袋給削掉了
it's like cutting off its own head—
直接就嗝屁了
it would be done for.
當然 這個也沒有辦法了
Of course, there's no way around this.
目前 阿省還沒有找到
Currently, Alberta has not found
石油出口的多元化解決方案
a way to diversify its oil export markets,
除了美國之外也沒有其他的替代市場
and there are no alternative markets besides the U.S.
但是 即使不能給美國斷油
However, even if it can't cut off oil to the U.S.,
阿省也不能給大家拖後腿
Alberta cannot afford to hold everyone else back
也不能擾亂軍心
or disrupt morale.
於是阿省就表示
So Alberta has stated
雖說現在沒有辦法通過斷油來打擊
that while it currently has no way to strike back by cutting off oil,
但是話沒說死
it hasn't ruled it out entirely,
不代表以後不能
meaning it could still be an option in the future.
而且
Moreover,
我們正在積極的尋找其他的替代市場
we are actively seeking other alternative markets.
請大家容我們點時間
Please give us some time.
我們省可以先採取一些
Our province can first implement
除了斷油之外的其他一些措施
some measures other than cutting off oil
先看看效果再說
to see how effective they are.
等等等等
And so on and so forth.
反正就是
In short,
阿省這次的反擊措施也是比較務實
Alberta's countermeasures this time are relatively pragmatic.
也不能說是為了空喊愛國主義口號
It's not about empty patriotic slogans
讓老百姓吃不上飯
that leave the public struggling to make ends meet.
接下來咱們再看一看
Next, let's take a look at
加拿大GDP排名第四的BC省
British Columbia (BC), which ranks fourth in Canada in terms of GDP.
BC省的省長David Eby就稱
BC Premier David Eby stated that
特朗普的關稅
Trump's tariffs
完全背叛了我們兩國之間的歷史紐帶
completely betray the historical ties between our two countries,
是一個向值得信賴的盟友宣戰
and are tantamount to declaring war on a trusted ally.
並且強調加拿大人民應該站在一起
He emphasized that Canadians should stand together
一致對外
and present a united front against external threats.
BC省除了參加
In addition to participating in
所有省都一致參加的行動之外
the actions agreed upon by all provinces,
另外基于BC省的實際情況
based on BC's specific circumstances,
能打出來的牌
the cards it can play
也就是
are mainly
對美國的天然氣出口和電力出口這塊
in the areas of natural gas exports and electricity exports to the U.S.
做一做文章
to make an impact.
咱們拿電力出口來舉例子
Let's take electricity exports as an example.
你看每年
Each year,
BC省出口到美國大約10億美元的電力
BC exports about $1 billion worth of electricity to the U.S.,
那受影響最大的
with the biggest impact felt
就是美國的華盛頓州和俄勒岡州
in the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon.
這個是對外
That's the external aspect.
對內就是面對著潛在的失業衝擊
Internally, BC is facing the potential impact of unemployment.
預計到2028年
It's estimated that by 2028,
BC省將會有高達690億加幣的損失
BC could face losses as high as $69 billion CAD,
伴隨著大約124,000個
along with the loss of approximately 124,000
工作崗位的流失
jobs.
其中受影響最大的
The sectors most affected
就是林業和木材業這種自然資源部門
are natural resource sectors like forestry and lumber.
當然BC省會採取一些有針對性的舉措
Of course, BC will take targeted measures
對那些受到衝擊的企業
to provide economic relief to affected businesses
和失業的工人
and unemployed workers.
採取經濟救助
Economic assistance will be provided.
另外BC省也承諾消除內部貿易壁壘
Additionally, BC has committed to removing internal trade barriers
加快對那些重大能源項目的許可
and speeding up approvals for major energy projects.
另外BC省也打算致力於出口多元化
BC also plans to focus on export diversification.
目前BC省出口的54%是去往美國的
Currently, 54% of BC's exports go to the U.S.,
這個依賴程度確實有點高
which is indeed a high level of dependence.
所以說必須加大力度
Therefore, efforts must be intensified
開始向歐洲和亞洲進行出口
to start exporting to Europe and Asia.
當然 一切只是剛開始
Of course, all of this is just beginning,
只是嘴炮階段
and we're still in the rhetoric stage.
未來
In the future,
大家可能還會看到一系列政策出台
we may see a series of policies being introduced.
好 咱們前面只說了4個省
Alright, so far we've only talked about four provinces—
安省魁省阿省和BC省
Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, and BC.
後面其他的一些省份和地區
As for the other provinces and territories,
當然也對特朗普關稅的反應
their reactions to Trump's tariffs
也大概差不多
are more or less the same—
也是強烈譴責
strong condemnation,
堅決反對，下架美國酒類產品
firm opposition, removing U.S. alcoholic products from shelves,
禁止省級合同
and banning provincial contracts.
但是談到其他的具體省級應對措施
But when it comes to other specific provincial countermeasures
打擊美國經濟
to strike at the U.S. economy,
這一個個都都不說話了
they all fall silent,
顯得底氣不足
lacking the confidence to act.
那要麼是還在研究
Either they are still studying the issue,
要麼就是小打小閙
or their actions are just minor and insignificant.
咱們說句不好聽的
To put it bluntly,
打擊跟沒有打擊一樣
their strikes are as good as no strikes at all.
當然這個也不能怪他們
Of course, we can't blame them,
因為他們的經濟體量太小了
because their economies are too small.
你看那從這個排名第五的薩省
Take, for example, Saskatchewan, which ranks fifth,
一直到排名墊底的育空地區
all the way down to the Yukon Territory, which ranks at the bottom.
這9個省和地區
These nine provinces and territories,
你看2023年他們GDP加在一起
if you add up their GDPs in 2023,
都趕不上排名第四的BC省一個省的GDP
they still don't match the GDP of BC, which ranks fourth.
因此說他們反擊力度
So, their ability to strike back
也就是一個站腳助威
is essentially just moral support,
政治上也沒什麼影響力
with little political influence,
可以忽略不計
and can be largely ignored.
跟前面說的這4個省 沒辦法比
They simply can't compare to the four provinces we discussed earlier.
所以說時間關係咱們就不說了
So, due to time constraints, we won't go into them.
接下來
Next,
咱們再說一說
let's talk about
加拿大普通民眾的反應
the reactions of ordinary Canadians.
這個挺好玩
This is quite interesting.
特朗普這次這個突如其來的關稅大棒
Trump's sudden tariff hammer
基本上把加拿大民眾給打蒙了
has basically left Canadians stunned
也引發了非常強烈的憤怒情緒
and sparked very strong feelings of anger.
幾乎所有的加拿大人都在震驚之餘
Almost all Canadians, while in shock,
感到自己被長期的
feel betrayed by their long-standing
最親密的盟友所背叛
closest ally.
從而引發了一種這個 怎麼說
This has led to a kind of—what should I call it—
憤怒和焦慮 混雜在一起的情緒
a mix of anger and anxiety.
這個情緒最先表現出來的
This sentiment first manifested
就是3月2日晚間
on the evening of March 2,
美國職業足球大聯盟本賽季的第二輪
during the second round of the Major League Soccer season,
美國洛杉磯銀河隊
when the U.S. team LA Galaxy
客場挑戰加拿大的溫哥華白帽隊
played away against Canada's Vancouver Whitecaps.
在賽前的這個唱國歌的環節
During the pre-match national anthem ceremony,
現場的加拿大球迷
Canadian fans at the stadium
延續了最近他們一個多月以來
continued a new tradition that has emerged over the past month or so
對陣美國球隊的新傳統
when facing U.S. teams,
再次發出巨大的噓聲
once again booing loudly.
你看現在在加拿大土地上
You see, now on Canadian soil,
甭管什麼籃球 足球 冰球
whether it's basketball, soccer, or hockey,
加拿大球迷們基本上都是“逢美必噓”
Canadian fans have basically adopted a “boo the U.S. whenever they show up” attitude.
而且
Moreover,
賽場上這個美加球員之間的打架事件
incidents of fights between American and Canadian players on the field
也比以往增加了不少
have increased significantly compared to before.
加拿大外長喬美蘭
Canadian Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly,
就是對這件事情
commenting on this matter,
說運動場上這種
said that this kind of
對美國表達一種公開的敵意行為
public display of hostility toward the U.S. on sports fields
這在加拿大歷史上也是非常罕見的
is extremely rare in Canadian history.
但是
However,
沒辦法 這可是公眾自發的反應
there's nothing we can do about it—this is a spontaneous reaction from the public.
這個跟我們政府沒關係
It has nothing to do with our government.
誰讓你們
Who told you
引起了加拿大普通民眾的
to provoke such strong dissatisfaction
對美國的強烈不滿
among ordinary Canadians toward the U.S.?
另外除了球場之外
Beyond the sports fields,
對經濟前景的焦慮和擔憂
anxiety and concern about the economic outlook
也讓不少人走上街頭
have also driven many people to take to the streets,
集會遊行
holding rallies and protests
支持加拿大政府的對等關稅措施
in support of the Canadian government's reciprocal tariff measures
抗議美國經濟的霸凌行為
and to protest the U.S.'s economic bullying.
除此之外
In addition,
還有更廣泛的
there's a broader
就是抵制美貨的愛國行動
patriotic movement to boycott American goods,
在加拿大各地都獲得了關注
which has gained attention across Canada.
從什麼雜貨品
From groceries
到消費品
to consumer products,
很多商場紛紛下架美國商品
many stores have started pulling American products from their shelves,
老百姓自覺抵制美貨
and ordinary people are consciously boycotting U.S. goods.
這裡面最典型的 例子就是特斯拉
The most typical example here is Tesla,
因為馬斯克
because Elon Musk
現在是特朗普的忠實走狗
is now seen as Trump's loyal lackey,
並且那位一談到加拿大就口出不遜
and because he's someone who speaks disrespectfully about Canada at every turn,
所以說他的人緣也是越混越差
his reputation is getting worse and worse.
你看現在特斯拉的股票不斷下跌
Look, Tesla's stock has been continuously declining—
而且現在很多加拿大的特斯拉車主
and now, many Canadian Tesla owners
都非常後悔當初買了這個車
deeply regret having bought their cars.
現在網上熱賣的一款
Currently, a hot-selling item online
這個給特斯拉專用的車貼
is a car sticker specifically for Tesla vehicles,
這特別的火
and it's extremely popular.
這個車貼
These stickers,
當然各種各樣的
which come in all sorts of designs,
大概意思就是說
generally convey the message:
當年我買特斯拉的時候
“When I bought my Tesla,
馬斯克還沒有現在這麼傻逼
Musk wasn't this much of an idiot.”
這意思就是說
The point being,
你別看我買了特斯拉
“Don't judge me for owning a Tesla—
但是 我得跟馬斯克劃清界限
I need to distance myself from Musk.”
當然特斯拉只是一個典型的例子
Of course, Tesla is just one typical example.
我自己也沒有買特斯拉
I personally haven't bought a Tesla,
也是從新聞上看到的
and this is just something I've seen in the news.
但是說到抵制美貨這個現象
But when it comes to the phenomenon of boycotting American goods,
這個我在平時購物的時候
I can personally attest to it from my shopping experiences.
可以親身體會到
I've felt it firsthand.
你看現在幾乎所有的商場
You see, now almost every store
都會對商品的產地
prominently labels the country of origin
進行一個醒目的標註
on their products.
你看我上週去Costco購物
For example, last week when I went shopping at Costco,
就注意到了
I noticed
很多生鮮水果
that many fresh fruits
都用大大的字型標明了它的產地
had their country of origin marked in large fonts.
基本上沒有美國貨
There were basically no American products.
當然也有
Of course, there were some,
但是那些美國產的東西
but the U.S.-made items
都被放在角落裡面
were all tucked away in corners.
而且我注意到
And I noticed
周圍不少人在拿貨的時候
that many people, while picking up items,
都得特意看一看這個產地
made a point to check the country of origin.
就感覺到
It really feels like
現在刻意抵制美貨
deliberately boycotting American goods
已經在加拿大深入人心
has become deeply ingrained in Canada
成為一種習慣
and turned into a habit.
還有一個好玩的就是
Another fun thing is
位於首都渥太華的一家咖啡店
a coffee shop in the capital, Ottawa,
叫Happy Goat歡樂山羊
called Happy Goat,
他們咖啡店
where they
把自己家菜單上的這個美式咖啡
changed the name of Americano coffee on their menu
Americano改名為加式咖啡Canadiano
to “Canadiano,”
引發了其他咖啡店的爭相效仿
sparking a wave of imitation by other coffee shops.
另外還有一個好玩的
Another fun thing is
就是現在在網上瘋傳的一個視頻
a video that's gone viral online
名字叫做 We Are Canadian
titled “We Are Canadian.”
我們是加拿大人
“We Are Canadian,”
在網上爆火
and it's blown up online.
他這個視頻是一個新版的
This video is a new version
他其實對應的
that corresponds to
是一個之前非常老的版本的視頻
a much older video
那個視頻的名字叫做 I am Canadian: the rant
titled “I Am Canadian: The Rant.”
那是在2000年的3月份
That was back in March 2000,
一名來自Nova Scotia的演員
when an actor from Nova Scotia,
傑夫.道格拉斯
Jeff Douglas,
為Molson啤酒做的廣告
did an ad for Molson beer.
那個視頻
In that video,
他就是發表了一些熱情洋溢的演講
he delivered a passionate speech
駁斥了外人對加拿大的刻板印象
debunking stereotypes about Canada
在文化上把美國和加拿大區分開來
and culturally distinguishing Canada from the U.S.
在當時也是挺火的
It was quite popular at the time.
這次這個新版本 他是在2025年的3月5日
This new version was released on March 5, 2025,
傑夫.道格拉斯
by Jeff Douglas
在他的YouTube頻道上
on his YouTube channel
發佈的一個獨立的新視頻
as an independent new video.
跟舊版那個啤酒廣告風格比較類似
It's similar in style to the old beer ad,
但是名字改了
but the name has changed
叫做 We are Canadian
to “We Are Canadian.”
我們是加拿大人
“We Are Canadian,”
而且跟啤酒也沒什麼關係了
and it has nothing to do with beer anymore.
這個新視頻
This new video
還是以這個傑夫.道格拉斯為主角
still features Jeff Douglas as the protagonist,
只不過
except
他現在年紀大了
he's older now,
頭髮也灰白了
with gray hair,
但是他仍然穿著跟舊版裡面類似的
but he's still wearing a similar
那個法蘭絨的服裝
flannel outfit as in the old version.
只不過
However,
這次是完全針對特朗普的關稅
this time it's entirely focused on Trump's tariffs
和吞併加拿大的瘋狂言論
and his crazy remarks about annexing Canada.
在視頻裡面
In the video,
道格拉斯發出更加猛烈的愛國的咆哮
Douglas delivers an even more intense patriotic roar,
非常的洗腦
which is incredibly captivating.
但是這個視頻的時間不長
But the video isn't long—
不到2分鐘
less than two minutes.
如果沒有版權問題的話
If there are no copyright issues,
我給您放一下
I'll play it for you.
看完之後什麼感覺
So, what do you feel after watching it?
反正傑夫.道格拉斯本人
Well, Jeff Douglas himself
把這個視頻
described this video
描述為給加拿大人的小禮物
as a small gift to Canadians.
他目的就是在貿易戰期間
His goal was to boost morale and unite Canadians
振奮士氣和團結加拿大人民
during this trade war.
他做這個視頻
He made this video
也沒有任何的商業利益在裡面
without any commercial interests involved,
只是關注民族自豪感
purely out of a focus on national pride.
怎麼樣
So, what do you think?
您的愛國熱情是不是被激發了起來
Has your patriotic fervor been ignited?
其實看到這兒
Actually, at this point,
很多人可能會問一個問題
many people might be asking a question:
你加拿大人
“You Canadians,
對美國的關稅採取對等報復措施
with your retaliatory tariff measures against the U.S.,
還說站在老百姓的角度上抵制美貨
and your talk of boycotting American goods from the perspective of ordinary people,
宣揚愛國主義
promoting patriotism—
你對美國真的能造成重大打擊嗎
can you really inflict significant damage on the U.S.?”
這個簡單的說
To put it simply,
確實能造成一定打擊
it can indeed cause a certain level of damage.
美國對加拿大徵收的關稅
The tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Canada—
這些成本
these costs
短期內都會轉嫁給美國的消費者
will, in the short term, be passed on to American consumers.
你像什麼橙汁
Things like orange juice,
花生醬
peanut butter,
葡萄酒
wine,
咖啡 電器
coffee, appliances,
服裝 紡織品
clothing, textiles,
鞋類 摩托車
shoes, motorcycles,
化妝品
cosmetics,
以及紙漿和紙製品等等
and pulp and paper products, and so on—
特別是在汽車製造等
especially in industries like automobile manufacturing,
供應鏈一體化的行業裡面
where supply chains are highly integrated,
美國對加拿大的鋼鐵、鋁、塑料
U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel, aluminum, plastics,
這些工業基礎用品的徵收關稅
and other industrial raw materials
會極大地擾亂北美汽車生產供應鏈
will significantly disrupt the North American auto production supply chain,
最終導致汽車價格的上漲
ultimately leading to higher car prices.
另外
Additionally,
加拿大對美國徵收的反向關稅
Canada's retaliatory tariffs on the U.S.,
包括什麼水果
which include fruits,
蔬菜 乳製品 和肉類等美國農產品
vegetables, dairy products, meat, and other U.S. agricultural products,
可以直接對美國農民
can directly cause losses to American farmers
造成上百億美元的損失
amounting to tens of billions of dollars,
尤其是在加州
especially in states like California,
佛羅里達州
Florida,
和中西部
and the Midwest,
那些對加拿大出口量很大的州
which export large volumes to Canada.
還有一個能打擊到美國消費者的
Another thing that can hit American consumers
就是對加拿大的能源出口的10%
is the 10% tariff on Canadian energy exports.
這個關稅
This tariff,
雖說比較低了
although relatively low,
但是
still
也依然會導致美國的能源成本上漲
will lead to an increase in energy costs in the U.S.,
給民眾生活帶來壓力
putting pressure on people's daily lives.
此外
Moreover,
關稅也可以威脅到與進出口相關的美國
tariffs could also threaten around 17 million
就業崗位數量大概是1,700萬個左右
U.S. jobs related to imports and exports.
這些美國人都會面臨著失業
These Americans could face unemployment
或者是工資下降的問題
or wage reductions.
另外還有咱們說的
And then there's what we mentioned earlier—
安省和魁省
the measures announced by Ontario and Quebec
宣佈的對美國斷電的這個措施
to cut off electricity to the U.S.,
也能夠
which could also
給那些依賴加拿大電力的美國企業
create production pressures for U.S. companies that rely on Canadian electricity,
造成生產壓力
and ultimately,
最終還是成本轉嫁到消費者身上
those costs will still be passed on to consumers.
但是
However,
別看咱們前面說的解氣
while all this might sound satisfying,
但是關稅向來它是雙刃劍
tariffs have always been a double-edged sword.
經濟學家經常形容關稅
Economists often describe tariffs
就是用“傷敵一千，自損八百”來形容
as “hurting the enemy by 1,000 while hurting yourself by 800.”
但是加拿大跟美國打關稅的結果是
But in the case of Canada's tariff war with the U.S., the result is more like
傷敵一千
hurting the enemy by 1,000
自損一萬
while hurting yourself by 10,000.
因此說
Therefore,
我認為
I believe
長期來看
in the long run,
最先堅持不住的應該是加拿大人
the ones who will likely give in first are Canadians.
不過 也不一定
However, that's not necessarily the case,
因為這次的關稅戰跟以往還不太一樣
because this tariff war is somewhat different from past ones.
客觀上
Objectively speaking,
還有一個對加拿大比較有利的方面
there's one aspect that works in Canada's favor:
就是美國這次的關稅打擊
the U.S.'s tariff attacks this time
它是針對全球所有國家的
are aimed at all countries globally.
也許
Perhaps
加拿大自己對美國造成的傷害
the damage Canada alone can inflict on the U.S.
非常有限
is very limited,
但是你加上世界上其他經濟體
but if you add in other economies around the world
大家一起抱團出擊的話
and they all band together to strike back,
那揍到美國身上
then the pain inflicted on the U.S.
也許能給美國造成的痛感就不一樣了
might feel quite different.
換句話說
In other words,
加拿大不是一個人在作戰
Canada is not fighting alone.
因此從這個方面看
So, from this perspective,
這次加拿大還是有牌可打的
Canada does have cards to play this time.
但是因為經濟不對等
However, due to the economic disparity,
他無法完全消除美國的威脅
it cannot completely eliminate the threat posed by the U.S.
加拿大的反制措施也是部分有效
Canada's countermeasures are only partially effective,
能夠造成痛苦並爭取一定的時間
capable of causing pain and buying some time,
但是如果沒有更廣泛的國際壓力
but without broader international pressure
或者是特朗普戰略轉變的情況之下
or a strategic shift from Trump,
僅憑加拿大一個國家
Canada alone
他是不太可能迫使美國迅速逆轉的
is unlikely to force the U.S. to quickly back down.
因此說
Therefore,
目前僵局的解決方案還是得談判
the solution to the current stalemate still lies in negotiations,
而不僅僅是報復
not just retaliation.
報復只是輔助手段
Retaliation is merely a supplementary measure.
所以說這個
So, speaking of this,
不過昨天我看到有專家分析說
but yesterday I saw an analysis by experts saying
這次美國對加關稅
that this U.S. tariff on Canada
有一個非常大的風險
carries a very significant risk,
就是美國公司
which is that U.S. companies
可以利用關稅引起的經濟疲軟
could take advantage of the economic weakness caused by the tariffs
大肆到加拿大來收購那些私營公司
to aggressively acquire private Canadian companies,
特別是那些陷入困境的
especially those struggling
加拿大的中小企業
small and medium-sized Canadian enterprises.
從而
This would,
達到一個控制加拿大經濟命脈的目的
in effect, achieve the goal of controlling Canada's economic lifeline.
雖說美國目前在政治上
Although the U.S. currently cannot politically
是沒有辦法強制吞併加拿大的
forcibly annex Canada,
但是通過這種收購的方法
through this method of acquisitions,
從經濟上吞併加拿大
it is possible for the U.S. to economically annex Canada.
美國還是有可能做到的
The U.S. could indeed achieve this.
不過看了報導之後
However, after reading the report,
我倒是不擔心
I'm not too worried,
因為既然已經有媒體
because since the media
開始注意到了這個危險性
has already noticed this risk,
我相信
I believe
加拿大政府也會有相應的保護措施
the Canadian government will also have corresponding protective measures
讓美國公司的收購無法進行
to prevent U.S. companies from carrying out these acquisitions.
所以說還是老調常談了
So, it's the same old story—
對這次美加關稅
the major economic challenges brought to Canada by this U.S.-Canada tariff war
給加拿大帶來的重大經濟挑戰
will not be resolved in the short term.
雖然加拿大人不想挑事
Although Canadians don't want to stir up trouble,
但是事到臨頭
when push comes to shove,
人家大嘴巴子已經抽到自己臉上了
and they've already been slapped in the face,
那也沒辦法 咬著牙也得還手
there's no choice but to grit our teeth and fight back.
那也沒辦法 咬著牙也得還手
There's no choice but to grit our teeth and fight back.
所以說
Therefore,
莊也我本人是堅決支持自由黨政府
I, Zhuang Ye, personally firmly support the Liberal government
對美國的分階段的關稅報復措施
in its phased tariff retaliation measures against the U.S.
同時
At the same time,
我相信屏幕前
I believe many of my Canadian friends
很多加拿大朋友們都會關心
watching this on their screens are concerned about
在突如其來的關稅風暴面前
how to respond in the face of this sudden tariff storm
我們應該如何應對
to minimize our own economic losses.
才能夠儘量減少咱們自己的經濟損失
How can we minimize our economic losses?
其實
Actually,
我在前兩期節目有涉及到這個話題
I touched on this topic in the previous two episodes,
但是上次提的時候
but at that time,
關稅還是懸而未決
the tariffs were still up in the air
還沒砸到我們身上
and hadn't yet hit us,
說的時候也不是那麼認真
so I didn't discuss it too seriously.
因此
Therefore,
當這次關稅已經結結實實的打到身上
now that these tariffs have hit us hard
開始生效
and have taken effect,
咱們就非常有必要再重新
it's very necessary to revisit
彙總一下
and summarize
咱們普通加拿大老百姓應該如何做
what ordinary Canadians should do
才能避免損失
to avoid losses.
首先第一點
First and foremost,
就是儘可能在購物的時候
when shopping, try as much as possible
優先考慮加拿大製造的商品
to prioritize Canadian-made products.
用實際行動
Take concrete actions
支持加拿大人的愛國主義行為
to support the patriotic behavior of Canadians.
目前根據統計
According to current statistics,
已經有接近10%的加拿大人
nearly 10% of Canadians
開始自覺抵制美貨了
have already started consciously boycotting American goods.
我是呼籲屏幕前看我節目的
I'm calling on my viewers in Canada
生活在加拿大的觀眾朋友們
watching this program
能夠有更多的人參與這個行動
to have more people join this movement.
當然這個話得說清楚
Of course, I need to clarify this—
我在美國那邊有很多的朋友同學
I have many friends and classmates in the U.S.,
有不少美國觀眾在看我的節目
and quite a few American viewers watch my program.
我這裡沒有說
I'm not saying this
挑撥美加兩國人民對立的意圖
to incite conflict between the people of the U.S. and Canada.
而且我也相信
And I also believe
絶大多數善良的有理性的美國人
that the vast majority of kind and rational Americans
也不願意看到
don't want to see
特朗普對加拿大的無理霸凌
Trump's unjust bullying of Canada.
加拿大人抵制美貨
Canadians boycotting American goods
也不是故意針對美國老百姓
is not deliberately targeting ordinary Americans,
而是一種萬般無奈之下的自保之舉
but rather a desperate act of self-preservation.
針對的
It's aimed solely
僅僅是以特朗普為首的這屆美國
at the current U.S. administration under Trump,
反全球化的這個MAGA的政府
with its anti-globalization MAGA agenda.
如果不小心剮蹭到了您的話
If I've accidentally offended you,
只能先對您說一聲Sorry
I can only say “Sorry” first,
也希望您能夠理解
and I hope you can understand.
我這裡號召加拿大人抵制美貨
My call for Canadians to boycott American goods here
這裡
is not
並不是僅僅因為愛國主義的政治原因
solely for political patriotic reasons,
而是從經濟角度來考慮
but rather from an economic perspective—
通過支持加拿大企業來達到
by supporting Canadian businesses, we aim to
避免加拿大公司出現倒閉潮
prevent a wave of Canadian company bankruptcies
來降低社會失業率
and reduce the unemployment rate in society.
尤其是
Especially
那些抗風險能力非常差的小公司
those small companies with very low risk resistance,
獨立零售商
independent retailers,
小連鎖店
small chain stores,
以及農貿市場裡面這些農民這些
and farmers at farmers' markets—
這種級別的商家
businesses at this level.
咱們能幫一把就幫一把
If we can lend a helping hand, we should.
你可千萬別以為這跟你沒關係
Don't ever think this has nothing to do with you.
既然生活在加拿大
Since we live in Canada,
加拿大的經濟
Canada's economy
就跟你我的生活密切相關
is closely tied to our lives.
一旦加拿大的經濟崩潰了
If Canada's economy collapses,
我們自己的生活也好不到哪去
our own lives won't be much better.
等回頭滿街都是失業的人
When the streets are filled with unemployed people,
到處都是領救濟的
and everyone is relying on welfare,
那社會福利
social welfare,
社會治安
public safety,
醫療保健和教育系統
healthcare, and the education system
都會受到極大的衝擊
will all face tremendous impacts.
最終都會反噬到加拿大
And ultimately, all of this will come back to bite
這些普通老百姓身上
ordinary Canadians like us.
況且你想買美貨
Besides, if you want to buy American goods,
其實也不方便了
it's actually not that convenient anymore.
你看超市裡面
Look at the supermarkets—
美國商品要麼已經下架了
American products have either been pulled from the shelves
要麼因為反向關稅的徵收而普遍漲價
or have generally gone up in price due to retaliatory tariffs.
你買加拿大貨不買美貨
Buying Canadian goods instead of American ones
也是符合經濟規律的
is also in line with economic principles.
看到這 可能會有觀眾朋友駁斥我說
At this point, some viewers might argue with me, saying,
現在美加經濟都是一體化
“Nowadays, the U.S. and Canadian economies are so integrated—
有很多美貨裡面
many American products
裡面也含有
contain
很多在加拿大生產的零部件
a lot of components made in Canada
或者是人工服務在裡面
or labor services from Canada.”
這個您說的對
You're absolutely right about that,
但是
but
也不能說 因此咱們就不做這件事情了
that doesn't mean we should just give up on doing this.
我覺得 還是得看您說的
I think it depends on what you mentioned—
具體的商品和服務裡面
the specific goods and services in question,
到底含有多少美國製造的比例
and exactly how much of them is made in the U.S.
應該是超過多少比例 就算美國製造
What percentage qualifies it as “Made in the U.S.,”
低於多少不算
and what percentage doesn't?
這個問題當然比較專業了
This is, of course, a fairly technical question,
我建議
so I suggest
您可以諮詢一些經濟學家的看法
you consult some economists' opinions
而不是問我
rather than asking me.
因此說
So,
咱們節目中就不討論這個問題了
we won't dive into that issue on this program.
此外 關於購買加拿大國貨
Additionally, when it comes to buying Canadian-made products,
如果您需要的產品沒有加拿大製造的
what if the product you need isn't made in Canada?
怎麼辦
What do you do then?
這個
Well,
咱們也儘量尋找一些除了美國之外的
we should try to look for alternatives from countries other than the U.S.
其他國家的替代品
Products from other nations.
你比方說加拿大沒有鰐梨
For example, Canada doesn't produce avocados,
但是美國墨西哥都有鰐梨
but both the U.S. and Mexico do.
那麼你選墨西哥的
So, choose the ones from Mexico—
你別選美國的
don't pick the American ones.
這麼做
Doing this,
一方面是為了避免關稅
on one hand, helps avoid tariffs,
另一方面
and on the other hand,
也是能夠促進加拿大各級政府
it can also encourage Canadian governments at all levels
有動力去開拓美國之外的其他市場
to have the motivation to explore markets beyond the U.S.
總而言之
In short,
就是儘量不要買美國貨
try your best not to buy American goods.
還有
Also,
如果你要是有去美國旅行的計劃
if you have plans to travel to the U.S.,
我建議改期 或者是取消
I suggest postponing or canceling them.
因為我看新的新聞報導
Because according to recent news reports,
目前有很多加拿大人
many Canadians
都已經採取了這種做法
have already taken this approach,
把去美國度假之旅
changing their U.S. vacation plans
改成了班芙度假之旅
to trips to Banff,
改成了尼加拉瀑布
Niagara Falls,
或者是魁北克度假之旅
or Quebec.
但是這裡咱們強調一下
But let's emphasize here—
如果您生活中
if in your daily life
實在離不開美國商品的話
you really can't do without American goods,
真的有什麼其他地方都沒有
if there's something unavailable anywhere else,
只有美國有的
only available from the U.S.,
而且對您生活非常重要
and it's extremely important to your life,
不可或缺的商品的話
an absolutely essential product,
而且是即使漲價你也必須買的那種
and something you'd have to buy even if the price goes up—
你比方說救命的藥品
like life-saving medication, for example—
這個您該買買
go ahead and buy it.
畢竟為愛國不要命
After all, sacrificing your life for patriotism
這也沒必要
isn't necessary.
還有一些
And then there are some things
你雖說不像藥品那麼危及生命安全
that, while not as critical as life-saving drugs,
但是你確實生活中每天都要用到
are things you genuinely use every day in your life,
也不可能找到替代品的
and for which you can't find substitutes—
那你願意買您就買
if you're willing to buy them, go ahead.
這個我也不勸您
I won't try to dissuade you.
不過我善意提醒
But here's a friendly reminder—
建議您抓緊時間
I suggest you act quickly
在這個全面關稅開始之前
before these full tariffs kick in,
儲備一些
and stock up on
還沒有來得及漲價的美國進口商品
U.S.-imported goods that haven't yet gone up in price.
但是記住
But remember,
囤積的商品
the items you stockpile
一定要找那些不容易腐爛的
should be things that don't spoil easily,
保質期比較長的商品
products with a long shelf life,
比方說什麼罐頭
like canned goods,
花生醬
peanut butter,
電器什麼的
appliances, and so on.
還有一些
And another thing—
你比方說
for example,
你比方說Costco
take Costco,
雖說這個Costco Canada
even though Costco Canada
它總部是位於加拿大安省渥太華
has its headquarters in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada,
僱用的也是加拿大人
employs Canadians,
賣的是加拿大貨
sells Canadian goods,
交加拿大的稅
pays Canadian taxes,
並且根據加拿大法律在運營
and operates under Canadian laws,
但是他畢竟是美國Costco的
it's still a subsidiary of the American Costco
子公司跟美國沾親帶故
and has ties to the U.S.
因此他在抵制美貨上面
So, when it comes to boycotting American goods,
也表現的是相當的積極
it's been quite proactive.
至少目前來看
At least for now,
我沒有發現
I haven't seen
哪個加拿大人號召抵制Costco
any Canadians calling for a boycott of Costco.
這說明什麼
What does this tell us?
說明Costco目前的策略
It shows that Costco's current strategy
還是相當的成功
has been quite successful.
不過回頭再想
But on second thought,
加拿大老百姓
Canadian citizens
目前也沒有動力去抵制Costco
currently have no motivation to boycott Costco,
因為關稅戰
because a tariff war
本來就意味著這個物價上漲
already means rising prices.
你還抵制物美價廉的Costco
If you also boycott the affordable and high-quality Costco,
你是跟自己錢包過不去嗎
aren't you just working against your own wallet?
類似這樣的
Things like this—
很難找到替代品的美國商家
American businesses that are hard to find substitutes for,
還有那些
and those
高科技行業的
in the high-tech sector,
你像什麼晶片
like chips,
電腦飛機
computers, airplanes,
iPhone AI
iPhones, AI—
你加拿大人想要抵制這些東西
For Canadians to boycott these things
其實是很困難的
is actually very difficult.
類似的還有YouTube
The same goes for YouTube.
你說我作為一個YouTuber
As a YouTuber myself,
抵制美貨不用YouTube了
if I boycott American goods and stop using YouTube,
那你說 我以後用啥
then what am I supposed to use instead?
所以說 類似這樣的例子舉不勝舉
So, examples like this are countless.
因此說
Therefore,
特朗普傻逼
Trump being an idiot
不能代表我們也是傻逼
doesn't mean we have to be idiots too.
抵制美貨
Boycotting American goods
其實更像是一種象徵性的舉動
is really more of a symbolic gesture,
而且也只能針對極少數特定的行業
and it can only target a very small number of specific industries
開展行動
to take action.
而且也不會長久
And it won't last long.
這個道理
This logic
其實加拿大老百姓
is something Canadian citizens,
以及政商各界心裡都是很清楚的
as well as political and business circles, all understand very well.
好 咱們把話題收回來
Alright, let's bring the topic back
就是前面說的
to what we mentioned earlier—
是面對關稅
how ordinary people can protect themselves
老百姓如何自保的
in the face of tariffs.
第一條
The first point
按照自己的實際情況 理性抵制美貨
is to rationally boycott American goods based on your own situation,
在力所能及的條件下
and within your means,
儘量支持加拿大產品
try to support Canadian products as much as possible.
接下來是第二條
Next is the second point—
就是妥善管理個人財務
properly manage your personal finances
以應對經濟的不確定性
to cope with economic uncertainty.
這個很好理解
This is easy to understand,
因為關稅威脅到
because tariffs threaten
超過51萬名加拿大人的就業前景
the job prospects of over 510,000 Canadians,
尤其是製造業 能源和農業等
especially in manufacturing, energy, and agriculture—
受美國關稅影響最大的重災區行業
the industries hardest hit by U.S. tariffs.
所以說 即使是加拿大政府承諾
So, even if the Canadian government promises
會通過失業保險的形式進行救助
to provide relief through unemployment insurance,
但是作為個人來說
as individuals,
也應該準備一些應急的資金
we should also prepare some emergency funds,
加強儲蓄
strengthen our savings,
能省則省
save wherever we can,
留一點錢在手裡
and keep some cash on hand
以備不時之需
for unexpected needs.
另外
Additionally,
在金融市場上的投資也要謹慎為上
be cautious with investments in the financial markets.
所以最近這個股票市場的波動比較大
Recently, the stock market has been quite volatile,
注意風險控制
so pay attention to risk management,
減少借貸槓桿
reduce borrowing and leverage—
這種容易造成經濟風險的行為
behaviors that can easily lead to financial risks.
另外
Also,
這段時間 加幣對美元的貶值比較厲害
the Canadian dollar has been depreciating significantly against the U.S. dollar lately,
因此說 您能不換美元就別換美元
so if you can avoid exchanging for U.S. dollars, don't do it—
至少現在先別換
at least not right now.
我估計這場貿易戰不會很快結束
I estimate this trade war won't end quickly,
加幣可能會不斷繼續貶值
and the Canadian dollar might keep depreciating.
這個時間的話
During this period,
如果你手頭有美元的話
if you have U.S. dollars on hand,
倒是可以考慮 把美元換成加幣 囤著
you could consider exchanging them for Canadian dollars and holding onto them,
等待貿易戰結束
waiting for the trade war to end
加幣升值 一飛衝天
and for the Canadian dollar to rebound and soar.
但是我只是建議
But this is just a suggestion—
投資有風險
investing carries risks,
幹什麼都需要謹慎
and everything requires caution.
我說的僅供參考
What I'm saying is just for reference.
另外抗擊風險第三條
The third measure to mitigate risk
就是可以考慮開展一些
is to consider taking on some
本職工作之外的兼職工作
part-time work outside your main job
或者是搞一些自由職業
or doing some freelance work—
週末送個貨什麼的
like delivering goods on weekends, for example.
是吧
Right?
就是那些跟美加貿易聯繫比較少的
Jobs that are less tied to U.S.-Canada trade,
兼職工作
part-time gigs,
或者是利用這段時間上個學
or using this time to go back to school
或者是參加什麼培訓之類的
or take some training courses
提高自己的抗風險能力
to improve your resilience against risks.
還有第四條措施
And the fourth measure
就是社區互助
is community mutual help.
說白了就是 加拿大人幫加拿大人
In simple terms, Canadians helping Canadians.
如果您沒有受到關稅的影響
If you haven't been affected by the tariffs
生活如常的話
and your life is going on as usual,
如果身邊遇到了有關稅災民
if you come across people impacted by the tariffs around you,
咱們儘可能的多多幫助他們
try to help them as much as possible.
或者說是去慈善機構
Or go to charitable organizations
或者食品銀行捐一些錢
or food banks to donate some money
或者食品之類的
or food items.
另外還有一個建議
Another suggestion is,
就是如果您生活在偏遠地區
if you live in a remote area,
可以考慮搬遷到城市中心
consider relocating to an urban center
或者是從一個經濟不發達的省份
or moving from an economically underdeveloped province
搬到經濟發達省份去
to a more economically developed one.
比方說
For example,
搬到多倫多亞溫哥華這些大城市
moving to big cities like Toronto or Vancouver,
目的是在大城市找工作
where finding a job is relatively easier
還是比小城市容易一些
than in smaller cities,
抗風險能力也是相對強一些
and your ability to withstand risks is also comparatively stronger.
還有最後一條建議
And the final suggestion
就是您需要經常上網查看
is to frequently check online
加拿大聯邦和省級政府
for what relief programs the Canadian federal and provincial governments
都有哪些為受到衝擊的企業僱員們
are offering to employees of affected businesses.
提供的救助計劃
These relief programs
這些救助計劃有可能是金錢的補助
might include financial subsidies
也有可能是給你創造新的就業機會
or opportunities to create new jobs,
之類的
and things like that.
當然了 前面我說的一切前提條件
Of course, everything I've said so far is based on the premise
是特朗普鐵下心來把加拿大霸凌到底
that Trump is dead-set on bullying Canada to the end,
關稅持續存在的條件下
and that these tariffs persist.
普通老百姓應該怎麼辦
What should ordinary people do?
當然 咱們還是做最壞的打算
Of course, we're preparing for the worst
抱最好的希望
while hoping for the best.
希望美國和加拿大兩國
I hope the U.S. and Canada
不要真的走到水火不容的地步
don't actually reach a point of irreconcilable conflict,
畢竟這兩個國家相互之間無仇無怨
because these two countries have no deep-seated grudges against each other
也沒有什麼不可調和的根本矛盾
and no irreconcilable fundamental contradictions.
閙到現在這麼一個難看的樣子
The fact that things have gotten this ugly
說到底還是應該怪特朗普
is, at the end of the day, Trump's fault.
他用一個根本站不住腳的理由
He started this whole mess with a completely baseless excuse,
親手發動了一場
personally igniting
本不應該發生的經濟戰爭
an economic war that never should have happened,
傷害了一個跟他關係最好
hurting one of his closest allies,
不應該遭到無理傷害的親密盟友
a partner that shouldn't have been unfairly harmed.
而且我自己其實也遭到了傷害
And honestly, I've been hurt by this too.
你看本來我這篇視頻文案
See, I had originally finished writing this video script
週二我就寫出來了
by Tuesday,
結果這位特朗普先生
but then this Mr. Trump
以每天一個重大新聞的速度
started dropping major news bombs every single day,
不斷的向世界發出重磅砲彈
constantly firing off massive headlines at the world,
導致我的文案這個篇幅不斷的增加
causing my script to keep growing longer and longer.
最後我是在週五下班之前
Finally, right before clocking out on Friday,
我發誓
I swore
我這周內容 到此為止了！
that this week's content would end there!
結果週五晚上
But then Friday night,
人家特朗普故意跟我過不去
Trump deliberately messed with me again,
又放出一個新的重磅炸彈
dropping yet another bombshell,
直接把我砸蒙了
leaving me completely stunned.
你到底能不能讓我歇會
Can't you just let me catch a break?!
這次又是什麼麼蛾子
What nonsense is it this time?
就是週五這天
So, on that Friday,
也不知道被什麼嗆到了肺管子
who knows what got into him,
這個特朗普改變了他的緩和語氣
Trump changed his tone of reconciliation
威脅要對加拿大的乳製品和木材
and threatened to impose new, extremely high tariffs
徵收新的 極高的關稅
on Canadian dairy and lumber.
嚇人
Terrifying!
具體的這個數字
The specific figures—
奶製品是準備徵收250%
for dairy, he's planning a 250% tariff,
至於木材
and as for lumber,
具體他沒說
he didn't specify,
但是 我估計這個數字也低不了
but I reckon it won't be low—
至少也得200%以上 我覺得
at least 200% or more, I'd say.
換句話說
In other words,
美國人
Americans
再也不要加拿大的牛奶和木材了
don't want Canadian milk or lumber anymore.
你們加拿大自己留著下崽去吧
“You Canadians can keep it for yourselves and breed with it!”
所以說怎麼辦
So what do we do?
這個只能是大家敬請期待
We can only wait and see—
讓這個特朗普的暴風雨
let Trump's storm
來的更猛烈一些吧
rage on even more fiercely.
債多了不愁
“When your debts pile up, you stop worrying;
虱子多了不癢
when the lice multiply, you stop itching;
光腳的不怕穿鞋的
the barefoot don't fear those with shoes;
死豬不怕開水燙
a dead pig isn't afraid of boiling water.”
已經被千刀萬剮了
We've already been cut a thousand times—
也不怕再多加你這一刀
what's one more slash?
反正加拿大人也習慣了
Anyway, Canadians are used to it by now.
明天我就去超市 多買一點加拿大產的牛奶
Tomorrow, I'll head to the supermarket and stock up on Canadian-made milk.
這個特朗普您放心
Don't worry, Trump—
不賣給美國人
if we don't sell to Americans,
加拿大的奶農們也死不了
Canadian dairy farmers won't die.
最後還是用我太太那句話來總結
Finally, let me sum it up with my wife's words:
特朗普
“Trump,
你TM就是吃飽了撐著沒事幹了
you're just stuffed full and looking for trouble.
好好的日子不過
Instead of living a good life,
你非得瞎折騰 折騰你奶奶個孫子
