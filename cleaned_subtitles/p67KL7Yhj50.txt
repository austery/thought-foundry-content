[Music] hi everyone I'm Nicola tangin the CEO of noris Bank investment management the Norwegian someone wealth fund and today we are joined by a true Visionary in the world of Finance Mark Rowan who co-founded Apollo Global Management which is one of the most influential alternative Asset Management firms in the world now we are the lucky owner of just under 2% of Apollo which works out at just under one and a half billion dollars Mark thrill to be here great thanks thanks for coming and hopefully you're a happy shareholder Mark in um 1984 you said God I'm just too late all the money has been made you came out of business school now a few years later uh you have assets under management at Apollo of 680 billion and the market cap is more than 80 billion so I think we can say that was a not a very accurate statement well I I think it was accurate because it reflected the business at the time cuz not only did I say it in ' 84 I said it in 90 and I said it again in 2001 and the point being in some ways I was too late for the business that had been done but the interesting thing part of the interesting part of the job is it keeps changing I mean you've 2008 we were 40 billion of AUM in fact almost every other large firm in our industry today was roughly the same size and then 13 14 years later we're now up to over 700 billion of AUM something changed it's clearly not as a result of our skill and talent we had to be in the mainstream well skill and talent helps right well look the skill and talent is to make sure we're positioned with Tailwinds behind us by positioning the business the right way but fundamental change is ultimately what powered our business what does it take to start the firm it it takes a little bit of luck look I had spent the prior six years from 84 until 90 mastering my craft so clearly I knew something about business but one has to be humble and actually accept that there's a fair degree of luck because I was actually quite happy doing what I was doing at Drexel Burnham in some ways the single best thing that ever happened to me was to be forced to make a change Mark there's been a lot of focus on how you are replacing Banks through direct deals with uh with companies now what kind of um business are you uh in a way taking away from them or uh doing instead of them well I think it's actually a bit of a misnomer the Press likes to report on this notion of Banks and investors fighting over private credit but I think we have to start with a definition what is private credit well for most people it means lever lending or direct lending which is a below investment grade activity and yes it is true that the vast majority of levered loans used to be originated in the banking system and now they are split between being originated in the banking system and being originated in the the investment Marketplace and yes we are engaged in that business but it is a very small part of our business I think generally financial pundants and other Market participants are M missing the bigger Trend to me private credit encompasses almost every asset on a bank balance sheet a loan to a customer private a loan to a company private a loan to a project private and so on and so on and the vast vast majority of private credit is investment grade so we look and now say are we replacing the banks generally not absolutely now we are only in the public market right it's not in our mandate to be in the private Market what are we losing out on you're losing out on 80% of the investable market and if you think about it public markets do not work the way we think they work in fact nothing works the way we think it works so I look at public markets today and I ask really fundamental questions like in the US which is the most developed of the capital markets do we have price Discovery in the short term I don't think so think about what's happened in US markets 80% of volume S&P 500 60 plus% of the market passive 10 stocks 39% of the S&P four stocks have determined basically profitability for the last four years yeah one stock is larger than every Public Market other than Japan that's the universe you're going into so you saying that um the public market is very risky I'm not saying it's risky I'm saying it's indexed and correlated and it is about cap Capital flows now it is not about price discovery of an individual security in the short term think about people who are supposed to be able to outperform the index active managers how have active managers done well basically 90 plus perc of the time for the past 20 years they have failed to beat the index did they get stupider no the structure of our Market has changed it doesn't mean bad it just means indexed and correlated and so an investor particularly an international investor who wants to express an opinion in the US no longer comes in and buys a basket of Securities they buy the index I think investors including institutions like yours you may not own private Equity but you will own Equity that is private you you may or and many do already they own Spotify they own open AI they own any number of tech companies that have remained private well why should it stop there I think there'll be or 100 companies that are private for which Equity can be raised maybe that is the new form of active management active ownership of companies or PE without the leverage and without the fund that's that's a ways out still the next five years is going to be about fixed income replacement is there such a thing as an Apollo investment philosophy there is it's and I I've said it it's purchase price matters so what does it mean this is so there are lots of strategies that one can employ there's someone who's a great great internationalist there's someone who's a great macr Trader there's someone who's great at chasing growth we are great at finding value sometimes that value comes from Trading hard work for purchase price as in our private Equity portfolio and asset management but if you translate it over to fixed income it's finding excess return per unit of risk so how do we get paid more for a single a rated company from a single a rated company than they could otherwise get in the public market Marketplace has it ever been difficult to stay true to the philosophy oh it's been very difficult uh especially when the US is printing 8 trillion dollars over a period of time and random companies have multi-billion dollar valuations overnight so what do you do now then uh what do you do then you you try to manage a lot of type A personalities and convince them that doing nothing is the best thing so this is the time where you're holding back a bit we're definitely holding back in adjusting how we invest right now we want returns so if I give you the credit Market return reaching down the capital structure and taking more subordinated risk feels like a bad bad idea today right using your people and your resources to get paid for origination and structure but being senior in the capital structure feels like a tremendously good use of time right and that's what we've been doing what are the main risks in these markets and what what could trigger something more more serious so I look at the risk today look the the risks in front of us in in some way are obvious we have geopolitics as one of the most overriding risk but not even geopolitics politics I mean we right now in the US I will tell you things feel great not only do we have growth and we have very low unemployment we have a backlog of fiscal stimulus that hasn't even hit yet three years ago we passed nearly two trillion in infrastructure bill it's still being built nothing's built yet two years ago $52 billion for Semiconductor plants not a single plant is open yet a year ago inflation reduction act to encourage manufacturing of EVs and other things here not a single plant open last three years in a row we've been the largest recipient of foreign direct investment and we're ramping defense production all of those things are fiscally stimulative against a backdrop of no legal immigration that is a pretty good setup we've raised rates 500 basis points what happened home prices went up stocks went up Capital markets are fully liquid this is a pretty good setup oh by the way we're we're have a $2 trillion deficit in peace time with a 4% unemployment that's a worry so one can look at geopolitics one can look at politics or governance as another and how how big a warri is the deficit to me um it doesn't it's not a short-term worry but it is ultimately a long-term worry how do you cope with stress I don't find the job tremendously stressful I literally believe we are the luckiest people in the world to be able to do this this the slogan we have here is we get to do this anytime someone tells me in The Firm they don't like what they're doing it's time for them to have another job within the Apollo system or to find something else to do if you come in pretty often and you don't think I get to do this this is not the right job for you I get to do this
