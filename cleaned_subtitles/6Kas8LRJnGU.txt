[Music] a good investor combines passionate curiosity with the Relentless Pursuit Of Truth integrating a diverse sets of information to gain unique insights creatively connect unrelated data continuously accumulating knowledge be a learning machine for me a safe and supportive organizational culture is essential it thrives on open disagreement Collaborative Learning from failures and successes and mutual care cultivating this environment requires Collective effort But ultimately elevates an organization beyond the individuals contributions for me a good investor is someone who has a good strategy really understands the market really understands your portfolio why the stuff you do makes sense and second is execution how you step into positions how you step out of positions how you manage risks and drawdowns if you have both of those a good strategy and sound execution then you actually might be on to something a good investor need to be confident enough to follow your conviction and take contrarian bets going against against Market consensus because popular opinion is not always correct however beware of your ego be open and humble enough to change your mind when new information appears [Music] [Music] so how do you actually become a better investor that is the topic for today's conference here at noris bank what we just saw was four of our best and brightest portfolio managers in the fund talking about what in their opinion makes a good investor today we get to dive deep into this question and learn from the very best and it is our great pleasure to welcome you all I'm shy Nanda and I'm trun Grand we are your hosts for today and wow are we looking forward to it absolutely trun we are and an extra warm welcome to those watching us live it is our hope that today would be an exciting inspiring and an interesting afternoon with us so today is all about learning the secret source of what makes a better investor some might even say an excellent investor and so we have four exciting sessions lined up for you on investment philosophy ad strategy on building successful investment organizations the psychological elements that go on to making better investors and the behavioral aspects of excellent investors and so it's time to kick it off the first session on investment philosophy and strategy with our first Speaker of the today Greg Jensen is a Founder not founder but you're the CIO sorry of Bridgewater Associates uh where he oversees their investment engine not only is he an excellent investor Greg also uh is one of the top 100 people in Ai and he is also a gold bracelet holder from the World Series of Poker so please join me in welcoming Greg to the stage [Music] [Applause] [Music] well thank you uh for having me the so when I think about our philosophy right and this is really about the philosophy that gets you to be excellent Excellence is so core to us and as I go through the different words that define our our um our philosophy I think it's it's trying to really focus on what do you mean mean by a buzzword like excellence and for us we measure Excellence by what we mean by it is continuous Improvement everybody starts somewhere and the question is can you as an individual and you as an organization continuously improve that's what we would Define as excellent and so if I start with what um see if I got this here um what are we trying to be excellent at and Bridgewater's been been doing two things for its whole existence 50 years I've been a bridge order for 29 years and we focus on two things which is to deeply understand how the economic system works and apply that to build great portfolios so we're trying as an organization to be excellent at that which means to continuously improve that and there's three components that are critical um to really understand our philosophy one is what we mean by fundamental so fundamental means what actually drives markets that we believe that you can that you can understand this that there are decisions that people make they make them for reasons those reasons add up to what we consider the fundamentals that um that those ideas can be you can think of them qualitatively they're not like not everything that you're thinking matters is measurable in a traditional qualitative sense but in any event that's what we mean by fundamental which is what are the true causes for the things that you see in the world and then the second step that we take is to take whatever you believe and systemize it what we mean by that is have the rigor to take the reason that's in your brain right it could be a qualitative idea but there is a reason the synapses in your brain are doing what they're doing and somehow there are inputs coming in there's logic being applied to those inputs and outputs coming out you can take the energy to systemize that understanding and it's critical I'll talk about why that for us anyway that's so important and the last thing is have a strategy for being wrong our strategy for being wrong is diversifying but there's different strategies but you need to know that whatever you believe with whatever confidence you're going to be wrong a tremendous amount so those are the three kind of core things I'll dig a little bit deeper on so first off what could we mean by fundamental what are truths that when we try to discover what's true about markets and economies there are things that are going to be true now that are true wherever you place yourself in the world that are true at any moment in history and we expect to be true at any moment in the future me the first one of those things we'd start with is that there's two ways two core ways to make money in markets one is to take on risk that's a risk transfer to you that somebody's offering to pay you because you're in a position to take risk they don't want to take right that's what that General category we call that beta not to be too like there semantic arguments about what beta means but for us we just mean the the amount of money you get paid for taking on somebody else's risk then there's a separate point which is Alpha which is the money you get you can make by making smart decisions in terms of timing in terms of valuation Etc that go beyond just taking on the risk so that we think about trying to separate that and think of every um investment as the risk neutral position plus the beta so what the asset classes are that you hold and the risk that you're transferring Plus the alpha that's very different the way we look at it that sort of formula of how you get a total portfolio return is different than how most organizations structure their Investments most organizations think of their Total return as their their Holdings in each asset class Holdings in stocks Holdings in bonds Holdings in private Equity etc etc and those sum up right and the difference is you don't have to combine your Alpha with your beta you can separate those two decisions and that's a big deal so first of understanding those two return streams recognizing they're different and the way you can combine them together can actually significantly improve how you invest so now when we come back to fundamentals and we think about what are fundamentals that are Timeless and Universal what can you say about markets that's going to be true 100 years from now it's true in China it's true in the United States it's true here in Norway um because you really want to base your beliefs on things that are fundamentally true and then build out the deep understanding about those things so to give you two examples of what we mean by things that are Timeless and Universal that the first is that the price of anything is equal to the amount of currency spent on it divided by its quantity right that seems simple but it's actually a world of understanding to say well how much money is going to be spent on something how much supply of it exists right and you can fundamentally build that you can build that in any time in any country um and I'll get into how we check that that those things are true anywhere similarly the price of something is equal to the discounted economic conditions that affect it and so when you look at the changes in prices it's because something happens relative to the discounted economic conditions in that asset those two things are true all the time and everywhere and those are big building blocks to then build a process around so when we've been building processes to measure that to measure those cause effect linkages of things that we believe to be true um you really starting in 1980 so the first thing I'd say now would talk about making decisions systematically why do you do this it's so such a pain right why do I have to write down what I believe why do I have to stress test whether it's true I mean most people want to skip that step because it's like okay it seems like this is going to happen or that's going to happen and it's been such a huge uh building block in our organization to say no we're going to have the discipline to always write down our reasoning right so when we talk about making decisions systematically this is not a quantitative thing this is about having the discipline to say this is why I'm doing what I'm doing that opens up a world so if you look at the yellow piece of paper that's up there that was our 1980 Bond system so in 1980 you can picture Bridgewater it was yellow piece of paper rules that were written out this is we're going to buy bonds if this happens we're going to sell bonds if that happens that were rules about what thought about money supply and other things at the time um the idea itself is not that useful but the process that it kicked off was critical which is we just scratched out one of those ideas put in another one learned another one but you start with this building block of what do you believe so that others in the organization can question that it's forcing you to actually State what your logic is and um and that allows constant compound Improvement that's really such a critical element to our philosophy and the and um the benefit of that is you can check yourself so what I'm showing here is just an example if you if you said okay let me say what I think right right now you might think well the um capacity utilization in the United States like the economy is running hot and that running hot could lead to um higher wages and maybe higher inflation and therefore I want to take this position in markets right and the great thing about forcing yourself to okay that seems reasonable like let's write it down let's see if that's true when is it true if you use that rule will it actually work in history right force yourself through that put yourself at different points in time that'll force you to refine your thinking right if you just take that idea that's like just something i' you know recently heard a fair amount so I just wrote it down so it could show and then you could you know have technology to just test okay well let's say you follow that rule does it work or not and what you find most of the time is actually a lot of time it doesn't work so now you think well I must not know what I'm saying isn't that reliable right and I show like a profit curve of the alpha that rule and it's actually okay for a long period of time and then flat for the last 35 years why would that be why is that getting priced into markets what's going on right and the benefit of writing down your rules is you could actually see whether they work um and that's a huge huge deal beyond that you can also know what you're in for for every idea that we ever use to invest we start with what do we expect from it right and so this cone chart illustrates this but every idea that we use in investing we say okay what are the risk and the return that we expect from this idea in the future and that gives us a uh an opportunity to then compare what happens relative to that right so the cone chart is when we first started the idea so in 1991 as an example we started the idea of of pure Alpha which is all of the alpha ideas we had at the time put together and then we've added to them and subtracted from them but um and we set out a con chart and said this is what we expect the risk return to look like into the future and every day we Mark what's happening relative to that expectation right and we do that with every single idea which is automatic quality control you could say okay if my idea doesn't work out consistent with how I expected it to then okay the world's different than what I thought and on the other hand if there are draw Downs in that idea which there always will be you plan for it in advance you're not reacting to that draw down you're saying okay if I have a draw down of this nature I'm not perplexed by it because I knew it would happen I expected that to happen um so knowing what's inside the bounds of what you expect and what's not is another critical element now the next point is probably the one that's most sort of Under Fire at this point in history because diversification hasn't been doing that great as a concept but but um if we thought about the Holy Grail of investing right what do we actually want if you want to achieve your goals in investing um it's to have something like 15 to 20 uncorrelated return streams this is kind of what we're seeking you never actually get there because things are too correlated to quite get to that level but if you you're seeking ways that you can make money in markets that are unrelated right and and the benefit of that is you can translate if you basically look at this chart most things if you take most of the Investments that you you're all invested in are reasonably highly correlated they're on the top left that means you can buy a whole bunch of them you're not actually getting much diversification if you see this curve if you're able to select strategies that are uncorrelated and you can move down that curve you can improve your reliability 3 five x with equally good ideas if you're getting uncorrelated ones um so that is really that seeking that search for what are our paths to get positively expected returns that are um uncorrelated to each other so that's again a hugely important part of our philosophy and to do that what you need is to to put them together in a way that actually works so when you do balancing and diversifying in terms of risk instead of in Terms of capital is so critical so it's usually people think in terms of okay I'm going to invest X in this asset Y in this asset Etc in capital terms restructuring your thinking to think in terms of I'm going to allocate risk to different things and then I'm going to try to balance that risk among things that are diversifying so that means you have to take high risk strategies and lower the risk on them and take low risk strategies and raise the risk on them in order to get diversification across them right and that's a another attribute of when we're thinking about diversifying now to slow down a second um just to put that into practice right so when you think about the concepts that are behind pure Alpha that is sort of the the best we could do in generating Alpha in the world the concepts start with the deep understanding of the world having studied everything that exists in the world that we could think of for 50 years taking that yellow piece of paper Crossing out things we don't like adding things we learn building those into algorithms that reflect everything that we've ever thought of right this kind of gives you a sense of how that literally works so it starts with different ideas on the left here that a you'll have different approaches to trading the market this is Again part of diversifying right you might think in terms of fundamental principle of value that eventually that that the cash flow of an asset is going to equal the the present value of all the future returns that you'll get you could make build that deep understanding of what causes that what what an asset should be worth today right that could be one perspective on that market that isn't going to help you that much in the next six 18 months it helps to some degree it won't help you that much so you need other perspectives well what are the other drivers Beyond value right we think of the essentially the movement in the fundamental conditions that matter so how do you measure those how do you build that into a decision role we also think about the effect that other markets have on that particular Market again how do you build that whole world out how why do other markets affect this Market how does that actually work and then the fourth thing is who all the buyers and sellers are one of the reasons things go far from fair value is because buyers and sellers do things for reasons other than the long-term cash flow effect and understanding the balance sheets of those players where they get their money from how that works those pieces all combined together and you can think of it as we have all of those ideas that we've been working on for years you can think of it as four people arguing with each other with different perspectives on markets that you then put together to get to a view in a market which is kind of then the thing that's on the second the the next diagram here on the chart which is okay you can translate those different people's views into a systematic process those build that systematic process to combine that information into one view of a market right so that we take that second step then we take those signals that we've combined together and build that into a RIS pie so say okay well how much risk do we want to put on each one of those strategies how much risk would we put in each one of the markets again trying to move ourselves as much as possible to the Holy Grail of 15 or 20 uncorrelated return streams and um that's then the pie chart shows the risk budget we try to get over time which is a very balanced risk budget across many different markets across very many different strategies across those markets but at a point in time which is then the furthest right chart you're not going to have views on everything that's another big important philosophical thing is you don't have to have a view on everything you have this world of opportunities to take advantage of you don't have to have a view on everything so translating your views at a point in time that things that you have strong views on through a risk budget that's at a crosstime risk budget you can sort of multiply the signal by the risk budget to get the overall portfolio that you end up with um so that's how we kind of put these pieces together in an approach that starts with qualitative thinking about from experts on like why would you buy a bond why would you buy a currency etc etc Translating that quality qualitative thinking interrogating it until you can translate it into an algorithm using those algorithms to look everywhere in the world so you can be massively Diversified because now you if you've actually taken the logic why would you buy a bond why would you buy a currency you could apply that anywhere in the world if you've done it well and deeply you can apply it everywhere so you can apply those rules while you're not even realizing something's happening in a country or whatever and um you could build up your Port build out a portfolio that way measuring point in time conditions reflecting all that logic that you've built up over 50 years of compounding right and that's kind of the last point that I'd say if you just talk about our philosophy it starts with constant Improvement and if you actually do constant Improvement as an organization and you compound compound that understanding right you think about compound returns in the context of an investment if you think of it in terms of an organization what you really want to do is compound understanding like what does the organization actually know and how do you keep building that out right and so this diagram on the left it's going to be a little hard to to say but basically this is my view of the three pieces that we've been doing to build out our understanding that allows us to compound as an organization the first is what's reflected by that Cube which is that everything we've ever learned at Bridgewater that we thought has value we have translated that into an algorithm we that it's it is that algorithm itself is data that's been stored everything we've ever learned about currencies bonds economies growth inflation everything's been learned everything is stored in a way that's organized such that you can find it you can utilize it others can build upon it we make everything that we've done we have the standard of it has to be computer readable which means we run it three times a day it's always updated it's always got the newest information and human readable which means that a human expert can look at this and understand investor can see this it's not buried in code but that it's available everything that we've ever learned that's what the cube represents now to have an organization of hundreds of people working on that Cube you need what the pyramid represents which is well how do you do it when you learn something where do you put it how do you reflect your qualitative understanding in ways that then others can access right so the pyramid and what we have in there is essentially our rule book of how you go about from an idea to getting the data you need to fuel the idea to building the visualization that other people need to understand your idea right and so that is the second component of it and then the third component of it is the circle around it which is reflects the learning process the constant learning process you'll always be wrong about a ton we have two inputs into our process one is the basic Circle which is we're constantly making predictions about the world we're constantly getting them wrong we're constantly learning by digesting why that happened looking back and building that out then um there's also inputs in the world something you've never thought of before new things happening right and the great thing about having a systematic process is you could spend all your time on what you might be missing in that systematic process how do you deal with geopolitical tensions and tariffs and and changes in trade patterns Etc you might not have that in your process but if you have a process that reflects everything you think about you can spend all your effort on the new problems right and the chart on the right is kind of what I want to leave you with the um it's the compounding point that if you start this is true of Investments obviously but true in an organization and understanding if you start with a basic level of understanding in 1980 on a piece of paper and you keep Crossing things out and learning and learning and learning and that is that thing is not in your head so it doesn't leave when you leave but it's actually reflected in that process that others can build on your understanding follows a compound return curve as an organization the same way way that you're an investment can if you continue to compound so that's our [Applause] philosophy thanks Greg for sharing your insights we really enjoy that our next speaker for today is Harvard marks from okre Capital Management now Havard has a passion for contrarian investing he's not only a world-renowned investor but also an art Enthusiast and an author we're really lucky to have you in person with us today Howard would you like to join me on the [Applause] [Music] [Applause] stage to wait there he is his hand went down I want to thank Greg for sharing his knowledge with us today and Nikolai and nbm for hosting us today and when I was offered the chance to discuss investment philosophy I said there's no way I'd rather spend my birthday I'm extremely interested in investment philosophy uh I think it has to undergird everything we do my argument is that our Behavior has to be uh well thought out and intentional uh and so our methodology has to be as well um and um uh you'll hear that it's different but at least we have thought it out and it is intentional um it starts with uh a conscious decision as to what you want to accomplish now this may sound easy well we want to have more money rather than less we want to have a higher return rather than less uh but the the starting question for any organization in investing should be will we will we settle for average or do we want to try to be above average now that sounds like an easy one but you have to recognize that investing it's extremely easy to be average you can buy off-the-shelf products that will guarantee you that you'll do average or you can try to be above average which is extremely difficult and there is no shorefire uh solution to how to get there and if you try to be above average it exposes you to the risk of being below average the two are inseparable so thoughtfully consciously intentionally which is it for you and your organization uh next um you I believe that an organization has to have a Creed a religion the things it believes in the things it doesn't believe in the things it will do the things it won't do because it doesn't trust them and you have to stick to it and uh again it has to be conscious and intentional now I wish the print was bigger so I could see it I uh I could probably see it if I do a little bit of this but um but the truth is we have to make decisions what will be our intention what do we believe in will we trust macro forecasting or will we uh abstain from it will we um pardon me uh uh how do you think about risk will you take a high-risk approach or a lowrisk approach which is your route uh to uh success it it's not the same for everybody um do you believe in the efficient market this is Extreme important it's uh the most important concept I took away from my uh graduate uh education at the University of Chicago in the late 60s um uh many people understand the concept very few people incorporate it and think about it in their daily lives these are some of the things that we have to consider so let's talk first about the concept of market efficiency now uh the the theory of market efficiency is that there are a lot of people out there and they're all numerate intelligent highly motivated objective and rational and they all want to accomplish the thing you do which is to end up with more money than you started with given the scope of competition how will you be the one who accomplishes the goal rather than them not easily uh thought out um now the the uh what we call the uh strong form of the efficient market hypothesis says that due to these circumstances all information is immediately incorporated into the price of assets to the extent that no one person can figure out uh which are the bargains and which are the overpricing now the the really strong form is actually a little different it says that the prices of assets as a result of this intensive uh process are always right you can't beat them and so you can't beat the market now I don't think that's right I think the prices are not necessarily right they're just the best that the consensus can do and it's hard for any one person to be smarter than the consensus consistently two different things but the um but the bottom line on both is the same you can't beat the market so the question is do you accept that and that that pushes you toward a passive approach targeting uh average performance low cost low risk highly likely to succeed to approach to to accomplish your objective which is being average or will you try to be above average in the face of the very strong competition that exists will you endure the costs will your pursuit of being above average uh permit you to be exposed to the risk of being below average and will you engage in this pursuit of superior performance uh which is not that likely to succeed U you know the first thing I learned at University of Chicago was that on average most people do average before fees and below average astrop fees and the thought at the time 1968 was well why don't they just buy one share of every stock in the S&P 500 there was no discussion of index funds or indexation these had yet to be invented Jack basically by Jack Bogel at Vanguard in 74 but you can see where the concept went and uh today most uh mutual fund Equity capital is managed passively or through indexation so it it was not irrelevant it was persuasive will you try to be active and be above average or passive and be average do you uh have the uh people in hand who can accomplish it or the ability to find those people and and hire them as outside managers um uh what happens uh at the moment when uh you know uh average performance is X and a few people publish performance which is much better and your bosses say who's the idiot who signed on for average performance um so these are questions but it's very fundamental to the selection of an investment approach to understand and reflect the concept of market efficiency the next is coming where is knowing where uh Returns come from um you can have an average portfolio and do average or you can say well this is is a company that I think is going to deliver positive news which is unanticipated by others positive surprises and if you can uh figure out which ones will deliver positive surprises you can overweight your portfolio uh toward those and then when the news comes out and it conforms with your view uh everybody else says oh I wish I had more they go out and buy it that forces the price up you are an above average performer so that's the root how uh regularly can it be accomplished that's the question if you think different from others you have what we call a deviant perception deviant perception how often will you be right as opposed to the consensus being right and you being wrong um uh this is uh at the heart of things again you're up against int competition and uh you know when I started my career at a large and bureaucratic institution uh in the equity Department people would ask well what do you think you can make for us and the answer was 12% well how do you arrive at 12 well the S&P 500 does 10 on average has done at that point in time for 60 years so if you can get 10 without any effort you should be able to get well let's say two 20% % better with a little elbow grease in other words 12 but what if all the elbow grease in the world doesn't accomplish anything because the Market's efficient and you can't get an advantage then it's not only a waste of effort but it's a waste of management fees uh that and of course management fees are the only certainty in the investing world now another important question is will you bet on macro forecasts every body makes macro forecasts and yet I don't believe that they are of any use that's a mild exaggeration but not so great um the truth of the matter is that most of the time things continue as they are so a forecast of extrapolation is correct most of the time and most people share that view most people expect extrapolation extrapolation of the recent trends the long-term trends is Incorporated in security prices so when the extrapolation turns out to be correct it's not a profitable expectation because everybody else had it as well it was in the price you paid the forecasts that are very profitable are the ones that call for um uh radical deviation from Trend radical deviation from extrapolation these are are very significant when you make them and they're right the trouble is they're not right very often because most of the time things are extrapolated and so we have forecasts of extrapolation which are usually correct but not profitable and forecasts of Devi uh deviation from Trend which are potentially very profitable but not often correct I take that an analysis to mean macro forecasting doesn't work and uh one of when we started oak tree 29 years ago this month uh we sat down and we wrote out the things we had been doing because we had the benefit of having worked together for nine years already on average and uh we have a very simple investment philosophy of six points which governs everything we do and number five says that our actions are not driven by macro forecasts we are bottomup investors selecting IND individual companies not top- down selecting markets and countries so that's a different we think we can get an uh an advantage by the way where does outperforming come from in short it comes from having a a knowledge advantage and you have to know something better than most other people to to outperform just trying is not going to help you if you don't know something they don't know so um we think we can get a knowledge advantage in studying the micro companies Industries and securities not the macro countries markets and rates for example so you know we bar that from our approach I one of my heroes is John Kenneth gbra who said we have two kinds of forecasters the ones who don't know and the ones who don't know they don't know and I've known for decades that I don't know so I think we have an advantage in that and then uh that kind of sounds like forecasting macro forecasting is unavail unavailing but the truth is that it can be worse than in its effect it can be damaging in its effect and I quote the American humorist and novelist uh Mark Twain who said it ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble it's what you know for certain that just ain't true no sentence that starts with I don't know but or I could be wrong but ever got anybody into trouble the ones that get you into trouble are the ones that say I'm sure that's such and such because if you believe something strongly and You Bet On It heavily and you're wrong that's how you get into big trouble so will you bet on macro forecasting this in my opinion is a critical and and uh overarching decision I wrote a memo u a year and a half ago I think it was October of 22 um entitled the illusion of knowledge and it's it's basically a rant against uh uh macro forecasting starting with a macro for a famous quote in each section um and uh I I think it's it's extremely important to decide will you or won't you start from a top- down macro forecast and most people do many people know they don't work they do it anyway and one of the I quote somebody in there as saying that most people couldn't get out of bed in the morning if they admitted how uncertain the the future is uh and so I believe that macro forecasting uh in my view often takes the form of uh can I say organized religion it gives Something to Believe In to dispel uh the great uncertainty uh present in the world they live in um and uh you know I believe that uh very few people have the ability uh to do it in a superior fashion now the next question is how will you and your organization think about risk what is risk um you know in in all the uh formula uh mathematical work in the investment business people use variability of results as the measure of risk I don't think that's the real risk I think the real risk is the risk of bad outcomes uh but um the trouble with my form of risk is it's not measurable you can't measure what the probability of bad outcomes is in the future you can't even measure what the probability of bad outcomes was in the past you can only only measure what happened which is a subset of what could have happened I on the last slide I I had a quote from Elroy Dimson who was a pressor professor at the London Business School he said risk means more things can happen than will happen the conventional view of risk is shown in this graphic here you have uh return on the vertical axis risk on the horizontal axis and a line that swaps up to the right and mathematicians call this positive correlation if one goes up the other goes up most practitioners take this to mean that riskier assets have higher returns there's something wrong with that formulation if riskier assets could be counted on to have higher returns by definition they wouldn't be risky so the the way I look at it is more like this I take these little bell-shaped curves I simp impose them on the same line it's the same underlying line but now as you move from left to right not only does the expected return increase but the range of possible outcomes gets wider and the bad outcomes become worse that I think is risk that is what people should concern themselves not the possibility that their return streams will be lumpy Buffett said I'd rather have a lumpy 15 than a smooth 12 and uh I think that makes a lot of sense so I think the most important job of the professional investor is to manage risk and uh you know Greg in his talk said what do you believe in and I think that's very important and you you could hear in his presentation how much of the time they devote to assessing managing and balancing risk and we have to do the same thing we have to assess it and manage it even though we do it from a bottom up micro level not top down but um I think that you have to constantly work with uh risk but you have to never assume as Mark Twain cautions uh that you know it for certain we never know what is going to happen and the events show that in the world we never know how the market will react to What happens in the short run uh and if you want proof of those two statements take a look at the US presidential election of 2016 everybody was confident of two things Hillary would win 80% probable and if by some Quirk of f Trump won the market would collapse instead Trump won and the market went up for 14 months 30% so we don't know and uh we don't ever assume that our uh intellectual process permits us to get uh the risk under control and then lastly you have to accept that it's very hard to have both Superior returns and low risk um uh a high degree of safety taking going for Superior returns mean means taking some risk you have to either bet on riskier companies riskier propositions things that are considered unpopular and out of favor and things that if you're wrong will result in your being below average yet and you have to figure out for yourself what your approach is I'm a tennis player and last summer while watching uh the tennis tournaments uh especially Wimbleton um I wrote a memo entitled few losers or more winners you have to have an approach in my opinion which will uh organize your pursuit of superior returns and there's really two ways to do it you have to either have more of the things that do above average or less than the less of the things that do below average there is no alternative of course you could do both I think for most people given their mentality one or the other is more likely the the the conservative person can in theory have fewer of the things that do poorly the skilled aggressive person can in theory have more of the things that do well each person has to understand their own mentality what's possible for them and thus their Pursuit will what their Pursuit will be and these things in my opinion taken together are examples of the elements that combine to produce uh an investment philosophy and we've done it at Oak everybody knows where we stand everybody is pulling together in the same direction thank you very much [Music] okay thank you Howard um since you are so kind to spend your birthday together with us uh we did want to give you a small gift thank you um I'm not sure if you're aware but there's actually two famous inventions that has come out of Norway one is the paper clip and the other one is the cheese slicer ah now we thought it would be a pretty dull gift to give away paper clips and hence we wanted to uh give you this cheese slicer in oak tree I should very good and and with a small piece of local cheese and now I can go home and make my own open face sandwiches excellent thank you I can take this one and if you want to take the seat we go for the thanks again Howard so now we will have a panel discussion um Howard Greg will come back on the stage and they will be joined by Jean Hines who is CEO of Wellington Management together with Patrick Healey the CEO of Helman and fredman the panel discussion will be moderated by our own Chief investment officer for equities Pedro fad please give them a warm [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] welcome it is such a privilege to have the four of you with us today Greg Howard what a way to start this conference today that was incredible thank you so much we are now joined by Jin and Patrick and we'll aim to take the discussion further so if I interrupt any of you please bear with me this is just to make the most of the time that you have kindly given us Jin I'll start with you so Greg and Howard uh ran through their investment philosophy and the need for an investment Creed you run Wellington uh which can be seen as a Federation of investment boutiques what are really the advantages and the pits of not having to have an overarching investment philosophy thank you and um thank you for sharing all your insights that was really fascinating um when I was sitting there listening it made me think you know we have about 60 teams like you said we're or we're not organized by one overarching philosophy and process I guess our overarching philosophy and process is that we believe a philosophy and process is critical um to the investment team we have about 60 teams um and um and and each of those teams we have we have a few in the audience today each of those teams have a very strong philosophy and process very similar to what um Greg and Howard um do and that's what they practice every day and that's what they believe um we combine that at Wellington um every I think every company has an edge I think our Edge is um that we are really collaborative so we have over the you know I've been at Wellington for 33 years over those 33 years we have really broken down silos and so that our long only investors on in equity collaborate with our fixed income um um colleagues who collaborate with our private col colleagues who do private assets and who do long short um that's the secret sauce like how do we we don't have one CIO we have 600 cios and we have normalized debate having different perspectives on any topic and then and then each of those teams can go and practice their very well thought out strong strongly held beliefs about how they're going to make money for clients that that's how we're organized very good Patrick I'll pull you into the conversation does the private nature of what you do have any direct implications on your investment process is there anything intrinsically different between private Market investing and public market investing well um I suppose given my deme of nature I might sound like the poster TR for private Equity but uh I'll say um look I think private Equity is an advantaged asset class if you're going to be in the investment business um and you sort of start with just the structure you know we have a 10 we have a a 5year investment period we can have the money invested for 10 maybe 12 years so we don't have to be invested all the time you can pick your spots that's a huge Advantage you get to do inside diligence that's an absolutely huge Advantage you get to choose and select your management teams you get to borrow money and I've been doing this for 30 years and I can remember I really over you know my first 15 years you're actually borrowed money with covenants but for the last 15 years we get lent money without covenants so that's sort of extraordinary you get to choose when you want to sell a business um and you get to have alignment you know in the boardroom it's sort of the investor and the management team you get to choose three to four things that you really want to go for I think that's a huge Advantage so as we think about sort of our own investment process and sort of managing risk like Howard and Greg you know talked about you know it's really about being super micro obsessed with the specifics of the business and ensuring that we you know maintain our standards that way M and you really invest for the long term and that could be like a good say Segway into long-term investing um Greg Howard how do you incorporate how does investment Horizon fit into your investment philosophy and your invest or like philosopy Creed well like uh Patrick says U maybe half of our assets are closed end funds where you have the money for a period of time and the great Advantage is is that the clients can't withdraw so you know they people out of control of their situation love to buy when they're excited and sell when they're depressed and our our this approach keeps them from doing so that's one of the greatest Advantage one can have in the investment business um I think that everybody at Oak Tree understands our culture we don't we actually don't even have a tenant of our philosophy that talks about long-term investing it's just understood you know when I when I travel especially to Europe and people find out I'm in the investment business they say oh what do you trade my back goes up I said we don't trade trading is guessing what something's going to do tomorrow we're investors we're in it for the long term and I think that um I think everybody on this stage is more of an investor than a Trader uh it I I don't I don't understand how one gets an advantage in the short term running such a systematic strategy G GRE do you agree well I think the main things is when I listen to Howard and and what everybody on the stage is saying I think the main thing is is in the long term you have to know what your advantage is and that's the big thing right so for us our our time frame that we really understand well and we focus on is 6 to 18 months so for some that's very long term for some that's very short term but but 6 to 18 months is what we've thought really hard about and um and believe despite Howard's thoughts on macro investing that that we have an edge in understanding what's happened the world now we are wrong a lot to his point and so you have to know how to be prepar for being wrong and within macro there's a lot of macro things going on so you can diversify across many different things that you're you're talking about but um but I think the starting point is that and that there the long term is going to work out if you know what your Edge is if you stick to it if you're humble about it and you continue to learn and long term is not going to work out if you're stuck on any particular um thing that you might be wrong about about and that you don't have a way of constantly improving and constantly learning um but for each of us I think the main question is what is the edge do you actually have it and can you continue to improve it mhm Jin you are known as a very long-term investor in your portfolio manager days which still um one how do you encourage your portfolio managers at Wellington to think long term so part of it is our structure because we are a private partnership we are we we can incent investors we can evaluate them we develop them over for long periods of time so that that structure enables that that we are we are really paying our investors over very aligned with our clients I think that's that's one of the very key advantages um and then because we have 60 investors like I'm one of the longest term I'm probably very similar to Howard I don't quite have a 12year horizon but I have a really low turnover my turnover is 10 to 12% it very much aligns with the industry that I invest in which is a very long cycle low turnover low turnover industry and Healthcare um but but there are others that have higher turnover and so one of the things that we try to do is we we do a lot of trading analytics are you making money off your trading if you're not if you have a shorter term time Horizon um back to what Greg said what's your sweet spot of of um H having insights and and being able to so there are some people who are fantastic who have high turnover and then and then I strongly believe for me as a as an investor having a a low turn ER strategy is and really taking advantage of the insights I have over the long term is what has enabled me to do well over many years but really having that self-awareness of how you generate insights how you're going to make money for your clients with whatever asset class you have I think is key to that excellent Howard you touched on on market efficiency and the importance of that there's now endless information and a lot of noise in the market um but markets are arguably become more efficient over time so a question to both of you how do you compare the alpha generation opportunity of your investment strategies now compared to say 10 20 years ago I think it's gotten a lot harder over time Pedro you know uh Warren Buffett talked about having bought dollars for 50 cents 60 uh years ago you could do that 50 40 years ago I myself bought things that I thought this this can't be exist and yet you you got Bargains virtually that couldn't miss it's very hard today uh if you think about it everybody knows everything today there's no such thing today as not knowing something if it's if it's fact uh today it's rather easy for portfolio managers to screen for Securities that satisfy certain criteria you know used to be able to buy companies for less than their the cash in the till uh we called that net net investing you can't do that anymore and so over time uh knowledge is cumulative markets become more efficient uh it has become harder uh to beat markets still I believe some people can be superior their margin of superiority May shrink their their work day may get longer uh but I I still it's possible but it becomes harder every day yeah I think again it depends on the nature like even when you describe it 50 years ago people could but not most people didn't right like even like at some point having a calculator was an advantage and obviously having a calculator is no longer at Advantage but I I look at it a little differently I think it's like the nd500 or whatever the cars get better every year so you have to get better every year but there's still a winner MH um and so if you stay if you don't get better then you for sure any advantage will will seep into General understanding but if you continue to get better it is like the n500 and the core at least the the core things that I believe our Alpha is generated from really aren't changing much I don't think we're getting any better as a species on things like love and fear and greed like we keep doing the same things more or less over and over again so I agree on things like calculating and Arbitrage that is like much easier to do it's generally well known those things are not there anymore but the fact that people are going to make we all will make really dumb mistakes and if you have ways of understanding that and doing that that that continues and I really when I look at the markets and the volatility of the prices relative to the fundamental conditions or whatever it doesn't look like we're getting that much smarter um it's true on arbitrages are going away I think that is the case things that you can calculate are going away things that are very hard to calculate seem as volatile as ever um and the miscalculations of human beings continue um so I I don't know that again I would agree if it's an establish Arbitrage it will not exist for like it'll get learned but other things um continue more or less as they have through all human history appears to me are there still more inefficiencies in uh in private markets to be explored relative to public and for how long I think the PRI I mean private markets were what 40 years now into instit institutionalization of private markets and you know for sure private Equity um I think that there uh you know is a whole class of uh investing that goes on a my world where we buy from each other's portfolios cuz like uh you know why do you rob a bank cuz that's where the money is so many assets are owned in private hands so I look at Christian we bought a business from you Nick humph is here from HG we bought businesses from them and what's really interesting is the return profile of buying things in the private markets even from professional owners like sponsors is really the same as it would be for a primary buyout and so you sort of sit there you say you ask yourself why and I think it's a whole bunch of factors including you know having a differentiate point of view which Howard spoke about it's having professionally trained management teams that really you know know what they're doing in terms of businesses so I actually think right now uh there's a lot of inefficiencies in in the public markets I think there's a ton of really good businesses but crummy stocks you know 25% of the public markets are 50% or below their highs so you know in terms of my shopping list um I'm spending a little bit more time at the public markets right now because I think you get much more volatility in the Public Public markets than you do in the private markets cuz when you're private and if you don't have to sell you don't sell changing t a bit Greg talked about the power of compounding learning um things may not always pan out the way that we thought that we think that they will um how do you instit institutionalize learning from mistakes in your organization so um we do we do a number of things some shortterm we have a daily meeting every day and in that daily meeting which happens in our London office between Asia and London and and and between Boston and our us offices and and London every day we talk about um all kinds of things and including sometimes we talk about if something's happening in the market you know what did you learn from the last time the market was like then what what mistakes did you learn so we do that that's sort of a constant a constant and back to like having different perspectives there will be people that will come to our daily meeting and said I got this wrong and this is what I learned so we have normalized um sort of not being a star and not being right all the time which is as we know being an investor you're wrong quite often um so that so those are some of the things we do and then we also do these things called Lessons Learned so we would have someone who's been investing for 25 years or 30 years and um and we ask them to be vulnerable like what like what was what really was the reason and the seminal moments in your investing career and it's really about investing these these talks who they are as a person what do they believe in how are they're investing what are the four or five guide posts that sort of made their career and those are all recorded and people watch them and and learn from them um and it gives you a good appreciation of of just that people are human beings um we try to you know we don't have a star culture and the more people are willing to teach others um and teach themselves that and you know as we know you you you haven't learned everything like I'm in my mid-50s I've been investing for 33 years I'm still learning um and so how do you how do you make sure that that's part of the everyday language so those are some of the sort of the the things we do constantly over time that sort of normalizes the fact that you're making mistakes all the time good Howard any views on the institutionalization of M mistakes um you know we we don't have a process for that uh your question suggests to me maybe that we should uh and May and maybe that's why I'm curious and maybe we will uh but uh our uh we have groups as as Jean says uh and and a high degree of uh Independence uh we're decentralized in our decision-making process as long as in our case everybody follows the same philosophy and goal system uh uh but uh but we don't have a process for uh post-mortems and I think it's a it's a good way to learn it's so so critical to our philosophy and we to be clear it's very hard because the thing that she's talking about was so important which is you you the last thing you want to do is punish mistakes you have to help people learn and and so we've struggled with the right institutionalization but I've been institutionalizing this for a long time so just to share quickly thoughts on it I mean the first thing I would say if I were in anybody's organization that doesn't like having a real issue log is so valuable and it actually works like for us it's very easy for people to enter issues and again when you think through what are the issues that matter everybody's got issues but the issues that matter to us are the things that are preventing you from achieving your goals and so to me then having a diagnosis process that we let people make it easy for people to enter and make it easy for people like to diagnose what's happening there's two levels of that there's the level of like in the org problems but then you have this record you actually diagnose and decide are you going to change anything as a result of this right it's easy to talk about problems but are you actually changing anything and often times right answer is I'm not changing anything um like that mistakes are a normal part of it but knowing whether actively deciding are we going to change something or are we not going to change something super important so having a simple way for people to do that and see that it's actually happening is super important encouraging it mostly most important is that the most senior leaders the CEO the CIO they're the ones getting issue logged and they're the ones staring because they make the biggest most important decisions so making sure the arrow of accountability goes up not down um super critical lesson in our I think we had a lot of the arrow going down and it was a big mistake encouraging the arrow of accountability to go up uh was a huge lesson in our organization i' change everything I honestly believe and the um and then on the investment process I me one of the great things back to systematic investing is you we know on attribution every mistake down to every data every little piece of logic every data Ser we know exactly why we got everything wrong like speaking to his to his point about terrible macro investing right like I really thought we were going into a recession two and two years ago or so and man was I wrong right and and but okay we learned something about the world that we didn't know and um and by being able to attribute that to every line of reasoning everything that we had ever learned that led us to that pretty strong conclusion not so strong that was disastrous in the way he's saying but pretty strong conclusion knowing that we could easily be wrong but that that but being able to attribute that to everything else and then attribute well where did the money come from that prevented that recession attribute every one of those things and what do you learn from that super super critical thing to get to get right and I would just say the thing I think everybody can do and I would highly recommend is have an issue log diagnose important issues get in the habit of it and normalize it it'll make the organization so much better excellent one last topic before we wrap up specialization um so when investing what are the tradeoffs uh between specializing too much and missing the big picture well I used to have a yellowed clipping above my desk 50 years ago orange so it came from the f and it said that an analyst is somebody who knows a lot about a few things and learns more and more about less and less until he knows everything about nothing a portfolio manager is somebody who knows a little bit about a lot of things and learns less and less about more and more until he knows nothing about everything we have to bridge that Gap we have to know that there's information in our organization that some people have and other people need and we have to get it to them and the people who need it have to know that it exists and where this is one of the greatest uh challenges in our in any organization Greg described uh the way all of their uh learnings and findings are actually uh computerize and computerized and shared and I think it's a good idea but um you know how will the portfolio manager who has to put together a large number of assets about which he knows less ever get full advantage of of the knowledge that the analysts who know so much about a few things have and it's you know we struggle with it all the time there's no easy answer very good we could go on forever but we must finish now we will take a break now Refreshments will be served uh at the back in the cantin uh for those of you watching live somewhere there uh we will back in the room at 11: at 1:45 p.m. sorry um but before closing let me thank you all for spending the time with us uh in Oso today it was an immense pleasure to have the four of you in this panel please join me for a round of applause [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] investment management is about taking risk and quite frankly that's what makes it so much fun but risks that means things can go wrong and from time to time they do and when the big ones happen man it can feel like a gut punch it really can the thing is is that in this game we know that this can and will happen um it's just the way it works structurally but that just does not prepare you for your reaction when it actually does take place and that reaction is so important and the different dimensions to that reaction like what's your reaction as an individual what's the reaction of your colleagues incredibly importantly what's the reaction of management how that all fits together that really determines how we deal with adversity and challenges going forward talking about psychological safety when everything's going smoothly it's super easy but it's when you're out there in the really rough water that's when you as an individual and we as an organization are really [Music] tested mistake an easy word to say but a difficult one to admit this is why it's important that investors are in an environment where they can fail and try again our first speaker for our session on successful investment organizations is Amy Edmundson she is a professor from the Harvard Business School and has dedicated her entire career to understanding the many benefits of psychological safety today she'll be having a conversation with andash melan from nbim a sports psychologist who helps our portfolio managers make more money so please uh welcome Amy online and unes on [Applause] [Music] stage now I I can't quite hear you conversation there you can hear me now now I can yeah all right but here it's super safe so uh no problem okay great I loved it I Lov the opening I loved the video yeah same here we have fantastic people here and uh yeah it takes a toll on them once in a while you know yeah so um psychological safety why do we need it it as investors and what does it look like well I I think you need psychological safety as investors because your success depends on your ability to make high quality bets now you might not like the word bets you might prefer decisions or Investments but make no mistake they're bets right there there's uncertainty in in in in that way um and those are absolutely dependent on high quality conversations and high quality conversations are dependent on psychological safety they require that people lean in and say the uncomfortable truths when they they raise an idea they raise a concern they raise a dissenting View and the conversation includes sort of questions and answers and and and makes thoughtful progress toward an uncertain resolution but one that people feel is is high enough quality to go forward right so what does it look like looks like a sense of permission for cander it does not look comfortable you know in fact it it probably looks a little uncomfortable because it's not natural and normal to sort of to lean in with the thoughts you have that you're not absolutely sure are right or helpful yeah so so the obvious question is also when it becomes kind of um unsafe it it becomes unsafe once in a while anytime but when it Bec comes like chronically unsafe what what do we do any advice to the audience here ah yeah I mean because when it becomes chronically unsafe what what you end up with which by the way is invisible and I think that's really important you know to recognize the the asymmetry um here because you can hear when people speak up you cannot hear when they hold back you just don't know that there actually is something in their heads that they're not sharing so so in a sense as a leader you have to assume that it may be happening and that that it may put you at risk and and the quality of the work at risk so I think what the the place to start is just and it may seem you know old or redundant but keep reminding people of the nature of the work you're doing that the work you're doing necessarily includes uncertainty right it necessarily benefits from diverse perspectives or backgrounds that you know that that have a different angle on the situation um and so it's it's um when I and why why does that matter because when you are reminding people of the uncertainty and what's at stake you're setting a kind of intellectual rationale for why it actually makes sense that you do care about their voice so it's so you actually focus on the on the why we need it so the driv not so talking too much about psychological safety might have backfire a bit no no in fact some ways if if I had my brothers I'd recommend don't talk about it at all but just talk about what does a high quality conversation look like how does it include people you know really taking those risks to share their thoughts and being willing to listen intently in the moments when they're not speaking right so that together we are making progress toward the best possible decision we can make all right so so this cycle ological safety goes a bit up and down so it fluctuates a bit so but how vulnerable is it really from your perspective maybe that's a bit too a global question yeah I mean this is the this is sort of the problem is that it's it's actually quite ve vulnerable um and I I think there's two asymmetries uh that that that people need to internalize uh and sort of intellectually and maybe emotionally as well and one is what I call the risk reward calculus right and that's the if I mean imagine a moment where you are weighing maybe not entirely consciously but you're you're you're weighing whether or not to speak up about something to share a thought a view and in that moment if you were to speak who gains well the team you know the the the um the organization if you will how confident are you that your voice will produce a gain not very and when will that gain occur well sometime down the road now if you because you're not quite sure stay silent who gains you do right you stay you stay safe and comfortable for another minute when does that gain happen immediately how confident are you that your silence won't produce a bad outcome 100% so that's a pretty profound asymmetry you know when you think about it you realize that leaders actually have to go on a treasure hunt because otherwise the risk reward count calculus will get you every time and and I think the other um the other is the asymmetry between um the the good and bad exchanges right so if I have U you know and maybe it happens rarely but if I have a bad a bad reaction to my taking a risk and speaking up and someone is dismissive or judgmental or you know even um you know downright humiliates me I will not try again for a quite some some time whereas if I have a good response it won't sort of preclude me from trying again but it doesn't necessarily make it that much easier it just doesn't make it harder right so again the degree to which I'm willing to try again goes vastly down if I have you know one humiliating moment and so given you know given those those sort of asymmetries you have to um you have to sort of I guess I guess I'm just answering your question wholeheart ly which is you are vulnerable yeah makes sense I think I think we all can relate to that as well so so one misunderstanding or uh or what what we ended up uh realizing sometimes is that people when we talk a bit about psychological safety we have to open the box a bit and then we talk about it and then people may be miss the point so they're trying to make it comfortable but for no particular reason performance wise so like you get points for making it safe but like you forget to to draw the link between that what's what's your advice for those misunderstandings yeah yeah I mean I think my my advice is again to to not again but to come to come to that um constant sort of appreciation of the knowledge intensive really intellectual work that you do um you know and that's that's different from say high-risk work in a you know in a a power plant or an aluminum plant or something like that but there is some there are some ways in which you have it in common which is that both require a sense of of of vigilance of very um thoughtful conscious interrelationships with others I'm interrelating meaning I want to listen to you closely I want you to listen to me closely we want people to be paying attention um and doesn't mean you have to be you know completely on all the time there are breaks of course and there are you know we we want people to you know leave at the end of the day go for a run whatever you know whatever works for you but but that that sense of awareness that the knowledge intensive intellectual work you do requires a kind of um alertness and an and an engagement to do it well um and you know what what allows people in high-risk Industries to perform well and to avoid sort of catastrophic accidents or worker uh accidents is not a kind of um I don't know a blind spot about failure but quite the opposite it's like a almost a preoccupation with failure they are aware you know that around every corner is a potentially fatal accident and because of that they sort of bring their aame to the moment to the moments that need it and all I'm suggesting is you can bring your aame to the moments that need it and it it's it requires um vigilance it requires a little bravery you know it requires just kind of an appreciation for for what's at stake all right thanks for sharing that isn't it interesting us nerding about you know on the psychological safety part so guess what Amy has written this great book I just finished it uh the right kind of wrongs is the name is a book about failures way great fun what fun so so you separate so so I think sometimes having a language around failures and doing things wrong is like digging or have some more Precision to it and you you have an interesting um separation between basic complex and intelligent failures can you clarify bit sure sure so a basic failure is a failure that occurs in familiar territory usually because of human error just a single dumb mistake leads to a b basic failure for instance in 2021 a City Bank employee accidentally checked the wrong box in an online form and accidentally transferred $900 million to a group of lenders right and then later a judge uh made a controversial ruling that did not allow City Bank to reclaim those funds right so that was a single human error maybe not paying attention maybe not well trained I don't know that led to a failure that we would all consider fairly sizable that was nonetheless basic so basic doesn't mean small or big you know it's a basic failure when you forget to charge your phone and you know Miss a meeting whatever but some of them are big some of them are small basic complex failures are ones with um the perfect storms they're the they're the failures that inevitably happen in you know relatively familiar territory when a handful of small all deviations from best practice come together in just the wrong way to create a failure a supply chain breakdown in a global pandemic for instance again basic failures can be I mean complex failures can be small or large but there the what makes what's different is that any one of those factors on its own those small deviations wouldn't produce a failure it it was The Perfect Storm the way they came together neither basic nor complex failures are worthy of Celebration right they're not useful like when we're at our best we can prevent them I mean some of them will slip through I understand that and that's okay we're human but when we're at our best we don't need to have those they they bring us learning but not a whole lot of new learning in contrast what I call intelligent failures are those that uh explicitly occur in New Territory they are the undesired results of thoughtful experiments so a failure for a failure to be intelligent um we must not yet have the knowledge we need to get the result we want so it's new territory much of your work is in New Territory by definition yeah it's in pursuit of a goal whether that's making money or you know mastering a a skill or making a scientific discovery you have a goal number three it is um hypothesis driven you've you've you've taken the time to figure out what we know what we don't know and you've made a good bet and then finally for a failure to be intelligent it should not be any larger than necessary to get the new knowledge right so this is what scientists do every day uh but I would argue in your business you are doing this uh as well athletes also do this yeah trying to yeah trying to get into new territory uh you're stretching and it doesn't always work yeah so uh new territory we need to take risk and we should celebrate it because we don't know it's hard to yeah you have to train yourself to say Okay that was disappointing and it's still valuable right it brings us something we did not know before yeah and all territory so we we're all human beings we had some erors small today you know things happen uh we should uh get them out in in the open so we can identify them learn from them and maybe who knows we might even prevent them next time but uh yes yeah exactly so that's useful just uh before we run out of time here um Amy so um we see that in this Marathon sport um you become world champions of uh committing mistakes or doing doing something wrong and yeah so but so you want to focus on the on the wins right but I can see it takes a toll on quite a few people any advice this is I suppose this is my job but uh any advice yeah uh how can people travel light but still remain their heart because we're long term we want people to last be I think it's you know part of it is having a a more you know training yourself to have a more rational response to the disappointments I and I think we have a natural response that's quite emotional and we believe you know at some level We Believe well that shouldn't have happened and it's it it it it exhausts us in a way to think that way and when we learn to Master the pause you know just insert that space between the stimulus and our response we can then think more rationally about the situation okay that's disappointing and what do we learn from it what actually happened and how do we use it uh to go forward it's a it's almost a Relentless forward F Focus we care about the past because the past is full of learnings but our our our focus is on on the future and and what do we do with all that valuable learning that's good advice I just have an After Burner I need to ask you Amy uh this psychological safety really strike the chord researchers applied PR practitioners organizations have used it to become better where are the herds going in social sciences now do you think you know I I I I I don't really know it seems to me all any anyone can talk about is AI so maybe it's AI nudges that help us Master the pause that help us you know sort of be brave uh be more rational I don't know but um we'll we'll have to just wait and see this was great Amy thanks for joining us by thanks for having me thank [Applause] you thank you so much Amy and for that really interesting conversation we are continuing on the topic of what makes a great investment organization and we will now hear from Robert Wallace of the Stanford management company where he oversees the University's endowment portfolio of roughly 40 billion US now Rob is no ordinary investor indeed before his career in Investment Management he was a professional ballet dancer with the Boston Ballet the Washington ballet and the American Ballet Theater now I'm not sure if Rob is going to talk about what the Performing Artist could have taught us in building successful investment management organization but we are certainly looking forward to hearing you thank [Applause] you thank you very much for that very kind two kind introduction Tron it's very nice to be with you uh today and uh I'm going to share with you a framework that I often use at at Stanford University when I think about managing the Stanford endowment and it really focuses on three things that we have to do right we have to do well if we want to be successful in the long in the long run for Stanford I call them the three pillars of investment success they are strategy execution and governance so I'm going to talk about each one of those briefly and then I'll finish with uh sharing some of our long-term uh investment results with you but before I start just to orient ourselves maybe I'll I'll mention a couple highle facts about Stanford so Stanford University is a research University located in Palo Alto California about 1 hour south of San Francisco in the middle of what's sometimes referred to as Silicon Valley in fact the technology ecosystem that is Silicon Valley really built itself around Stanford over the last 50 or 60 years and important companies like Google were actually uh started on the Stanford campus the University was founded in the late 1800s uh and unusually at the time it was founded as a co-educational school so the very first class that matriculated at Stanford had both men and women in it today there's 7,000 undergraduates at Stanford 10,000 graduate students and 2,300 faculty members the endowment as as Tron just uh mentioned is about $40 billion and this year it will distribute to the operating budget of of the University $2 billion so that is the single largest line item in Stanford's $9 billion operating budget so that brings me to the first thing that you need to do right if you want to be a successful long-term investor and that's strategy and here's a quote from the great Norwegian polar Explorer almanson Victory awaits him who has everything in order people call it luck what a nice succinct way to talk about strategy you have a goal you need to build a plan a strategy to achieve your goal we have two key goals for the Stanford endowment one we want to be able to be a material part of the of the life the academic life of the current generation of students and Scholars at Stanford so I mentioned roughly $2 billion flowing from the endowment this year it's about 5% of the value of the endowment that's goal number one goal number two is we want to be as at least as impactful and supportive for all future generations of students and Scholars at Stanford so that introduces a concept that we call the presid conservation of purchasing power so that just means that if you're spending 5% every year from your endowment you have to earn back at least that 5% but you'll also have to earn enough to offset the impacts of inflation the inflation that we care about at Stanford is higher education price inflation which tends to run a little bit higher than Consumer Price inflation so if CPI runs at 2 to 3% over 40 or 50 years higher education price inflation is going to run at 3 to 4% so when you put 5% of payout together with 4% inflation you you have a pretty high you need to have a pretty high uh expected return to offset uh your spending and still preserve the purchasing power of the endowment so the way that we do that is we have an equity bias in the portfolio equities have a higher expected return than fixed income or cash and that's really important in the long run if you want to achieve that second goal unfortunately as we all know equities are very risky you rank the lowest priority in the capital structure it's much more uh possible to lose your capital and have a capital impairment equities are also very price volatile and volatility is not not the only risk that you care about it's not even uh you know maybe not even the main risk but it is a risk and the reason that it is is a risk is because unnecessary or extra volatility work will that you're not being paid for will erode your long-term compound return so to make this clear with a simple example if you start with $100 and you have a 50% return in year 2 and a negative 50% return sorry 50% return in year 1 and a negative 50% return in year two where do you end up well at the end of year one your $100 has become 150 and then in year two you lose 50% it becomes 75 so you're up 50 down 50 but you've just lost 25% of your money so volatility erodes longterm compound returns you can see that with the identity shown on the bottom of the slide whenever volatility is greater than zero your geometric or your compound return will be lower than your single period expected arithmetic return so how do we deal with that extra risk we diversify we look for something that Noel Lauri at Harry Marco it's called the free lunch so we own different types of equities we own some equities in the United States some equities in Europe some equities in Asia some that are purely corporate so think of venture capital some that are backed by physical assets so think of real estate and when we put those uh equities together they are positively correlated with each other but they're not perfectly correlated so we they react somewhat differently to different macroeconomic states of the world so we're starting to gain some stability through that diversification then we introduced two other asset classes fixed income and absolute return which is a collection of carefully chosen um relative value strategies from the hedge fund world and we put them together with the equity uh asset classes in our portfolio we we end up with a portfolio designed to give us a pretty high expected return but with uh with uh with low levels of volatility or reasonable levels of volatility this is our policy asset allocation at Stanford right now so this is the the most succinct way that I can explain our strategy down the left hand side you can see all the major asset classes as we Define them on the right you can see their policy Target weights and everything on this slide is an equity oriented asset class except for those two middle asset classes absolute return and fixed income if you do the quick math you can see that the equity asset classes add up to about 70% of the portfolio so here you can see we're designing a strategy to achieve our goal this is an equity oriented portfolio yet it has substantial levels of diversification when we model this portfolio it gives us an expected single period return of 88.3% so that's deflated by higher education price inflation expected volatility of 15% on an annual basis and that leads to a compound return expectation of 7.1% net of net of inflation so if this is true if we designed the if we specified the portfolio correctly and we achieve a 7% real return we can pay out 5% a year or even a little bit more and still preserve their purchasing power of the Endowment for future Generations the next key pillar that we have to get right is execution and this is one of my favorite quotes from the American inventor Thomas Edison opportunity is missed by most people because it become it comes dressed in overalls and looks like work and this really is what we do most days at Stanford management company we execute against the strategy that I just showed you so execution has a couple parts the first is portfolio management so every day we get a flash estimate of where the portfolio is it comes out about 7:30 a.m. and we may start to make one of two types of actions the first is we may rebalance the portfolio between asset classes so as Market movements take those asset classes away from their policy weights the the the risk return and liquidity characteristics of the portfolio start to shift from what we think is ideal so we will normally sell what's gone up in value and bring it back down to Target and we'll buy what's gone down in value and bring it back up to Target and that way we preserve the right risk return for the portfolio going forward so that's rebalancing sometimes we rebalance once a week or once every two weeks in volatile Capital Market environments we may rebalance every day the second type of portfolio management that we conduct is rotating Capital inside of asset classes so I should take a moment and explain that the security level decisions for the Stanford endowment are made by external partners that we find we identify we try to build long-term relationships these are very specialist Partners very very good at what they do whether it's stock picking or venture capital or private real estate it's very hard to find these partners and I'll talk about that in a minute but once we have found them we have a strong trustful communication and when their opportunity set evolves we can take some action to optimize Stanford's Capital so if their opportunity set gets more attractive we can give them more money if it gets a little bit less attractive we can take some money back so we're always doing that the combination of rebalancing between asset classes and rotating Capital within an asset class can sometimes take up 30 40 or even 50% of the value of the endowment in a single year so they're very we're very active in managing the portfolio so I mentioned external Partners this is a really critical part of execution uh and a huge part of what we spend time on at Stanford management company these are generally speaking pretty small Niche Boutique investment firms that we find they're very principally oriented you probably wouldn't know the names of most of them um and I'll tell you what we look for when we when we when we when we go looking for new partners first of all we want to see discipline we want to see partners that understand the difference between investment and spe ulation understand that some things can be analyzed with a high degree of rigor and some things can't be and we want them to focus their investment work on the former and not the latter we want them to have a strong thorough and repeatable process something that we can see and feel in touch that surfaces all the hard and soft variables that they need to think about in any given situation and then finally we wanted them to take all that data and apply Superior investment judgment that's the hardest part for us to sus out when we're meeting with a new partner um really how do they assess risk and return what kind of weights do they put on the various parts of their investment thesis and usually when we make a mistake about a partner it's usually that we we get their uh investment judgment uh wrong we like it when our partners have the appropriate amount of capital so investment success often leads people to have too much Capital they kind of outgrow their competitive Sweet Spot it's very common we'd like it when that happens that our partners return capital to us and so it's really important that that size doesn't become the enemy of performance in our portfolio and finally we we try to structure a a strong economic alignment of Interest with our partners so are we compensating them appropriately over the right time Horizon over the right cost of capital are they putting their money alongside us uh so that we're eating the same cooking do they do well when they do well for Stanford these are all important parts of what makes a successful long-term relationship I should also mentioned at Stanford that we believe long-term investment success requires an appropriate regard for human and environmental welfare so we insist that our partners have that same philosophy that philosophical alignment of interest is just as important as the economic this slide sort of gives you some data on why partner selection or security selection is so important we're looking at leverage buyout funds from the United States uh formed between 2000 and 2001 and 20 thou 2020 so these are reasonably mature buyout funds the top dated line line is the top fifth percentile buyout result for that year the bottom line is the bottom fifth percentile and the and the median is shown in the solid line in the middle so one thing immediately jumps out from the slide if you're in the top of the distribution if you're in the top fifth percentile of the leverage buyout Universe in the United States you're outperforming a median by around 20 points per year these are net annual irrs so 20 points per year on a closed end fund that's 10 or 12 years in in in life is a really is a lot of money at the end of the day so that's an incredible outcome if you can be in the top of the distribution the second thing that jumps off the slide is look at how bad you do if you're in the bottom of the distribution if you're the bottom fifth percentile you're underperforming the median by 20 points per year you're almost certainly ending up with a a result that's that's uh that's below the public markets that you could access for you know very easily for low so this slide really um is why execution is so important if you have a complex strategy like Stanford you have to feel certain that you can be in the top of the distribution in this type of asset class I could show you similar slides for Venture Capital it would be be even more dramatic private real estate absolute return strategies all of them show this type of dispersion which means that you really need to execute well if you have the type of strategy that Stanford has how do you execute well well you have to have the right team so we uh we look for we hire people that are very intellectually curious we heard about this from some of the early speakers people that really want to continually grow as investors that seek and accept a high degree of personal accountability for their work so I often tell our analysts at Stanford management company you are the Stanford endowment I I really want them to internalize uh their work for Stanford it helps that they're motivated by Stanford's uh academic Mission this is you know it's hard work and and and and so having some psychological benefit knowing that you're doing something that is very valuable for the world is really important for the team we also try to grow our own Talent so we're often hiring right out of Stanford undergraduate uh and and training our own training our own investment Professionals in fact I'm joined today by my colleague TAA Rosenberg who's an analyst in our office TAA is was born and raised in Oslo she went to Stanford undergraduate and While She Was An undergraduate there uh she took our class in economics that we teach once a year and she became an intern in our office after she got her Master's Degree she joined us full-time and so it's TAA is a great example of someone who's intellectually curious seeks and accepts a high degree of personal accountability and is very motivated by Stanford's Mission we're delighted to have her on the team you take the right people and you put them in the right culture so we have a very open collaborative culture I like to think we're all in the same rowboat pulling towards the same Shore we all sit on the same open floor plan we try to reduce bureaucracy we try to minimize hierarchy that's a lot better for communication it's a lot better for training your Junior professionals and it's also a lot more fun and having fun is a really important part of long-term success so the final final pillar of investment success is governance and this one is talked about less but it's just as important here's a great quote from another uh incredibly impressive Norwegian polar Explorer nonon the difficult is what takes a little time the impossible is what takes a little longer and this is a great quote about governance so governance just as important as the other two pillars and good governance supports the disciplined execution of the right strategy and this is really critically important particularly in times of Market extremes so you can think of a time of extreme Euphoria where there's some hot sector some hot asset class of the day that's dramatically outperforming everything else and by definition your Diversified portfolio will underperform that hot sector and bad governance would would say chase that sector always go with a you know try to catch up with what's performing well that's unlikely to work out well over time and certainly would entail taking a lot of risk the other type of extreme is fear and panic so think of the fall of 2008 when everybody was selling every risky asset and trying to raise cash the right thing to do in that environment if you were an Institutional Investor was to buy the things that people were selling buy the things that had fallen 40% 50% 60% and sell the other stuff to rebalance your portfolio to bring the desired risk and return back to the portfolio on a go forward basis so governance reinforces the discipline execution of the right strategy and shelters the management team from external influences that might make that very hard okay so uh just uh to finish on this one this is our long-term invest investment uh results so if you had taken so Sanford management company was formed in 1991 to professionally manage the endowment if you had taken $100 in 1991 and invested it in the endowment portfolio you would have made 32 times your money by the middle of last year that's roughly double the result that you would have achieved in a in the typical uh us endowment uh fund and roughly four times uh the result that you would have achieved had you taken that same $100 and invested it in a 7030 portfolio 70% Global equities 30% high quality bonds so if you can if you form the right strategy if you specify the right strategy based on the goals that matter to you if you have the ability to execute on that strategy and then you have good governance that protects you from outside interference you can get uh attractive long-term investment results thank you very much thanks so much Robert we really enjoyed hearing from you now that we've heard a little bit about what makes successful investment organizations it's time to shift our Focus to those that make these organizations successful the investors what elements of psychology go on to making better investors what do in investors have in common with professional athletes let's see what our team performance coach from nbim Bion mansburg has to say I don't believe in miracles even though they sometimes happen to the scoring great performance comes from working hard doing the right things and stop doing the wrong ones sounds um easy right through my whole life I've been working with performance cultures as a fighter pilot in the Air Force with the best football team in Norway and with some of the best Financial investors in the world so what is the common denominator for high performers it is the way we as individuals keep on strengthening and regulating our capacity always striving to learn develop our skill sets and maintain a conscious focus it is also the way we interact with others sharing Lessons Learned giving feedback exploiting our diversity and taking risk together bottom line it is your ability to do what's right for you and your team a sustainable high performance organization is not a miracle it is hard conscious work [Music] teamwork so in person um here today we are so lucky to have Mark Rowan the co-founder and current CEO of Apollo Global Management now not only is Mark a highly successful investor he is also a well-known philanthropist supporting initiatives on projects within education art and Healthcare so please welcome Mark Rowan to the sage [Applause] [Music] thank you and what amazing advice we have all been the beneficiaries of not just just most recently from Adam U but this morning uh I thought I'd come at this my own way um and when I tell my organization don't be defensive be curious change is a constant we as investors we in financial services I think have consistently underestimated the impact of change we've been resistant to change we've denied change we stick to the status quo and I thought I'd just maybe share some examples of change and how impactful it is so this is now my 40th year doing this and I tell my team I look back over 40 years and when I started no highi old bonds no leverage loans no ETFs minimal securitized product now those four products are incredibly dominant in our financial landscape why do we think they're going to be here in 5 or 10 years why do we build investment strategies on them are the circumstances that allowed them to essentially take hold still the circumstances today I don't know I look back again over 40 years and I think we've lived in a period of Tailwinds for my career I think I've live been very fortunate I think most of you have been very fortunate we've had four Tailwinds rates have gone from high to low we have printed an awful lot of money we have borrowed forward future demand through fiscal borrowing almost everywhere in the world and we've had the benefit of globalization are any of those four things true going forward I don't know I think there's a healthy debate as to whether they are headwinds but I would argue I think we're in the absence of Tailwinds why would we think the investment strategies that work for the past 40 years would work going forward is there actually any value to track record over the last 10 years or should we just completely throw it away we all as investors take great comfort of looking at the last five years the last 10 years what are the chances that we're going to print in the US another 8 trillion dollar and everything will go up to the right why would track record be relevant you know I think I healthy skepticism you were in 2019 the best investor in the world you left Norway and you moved to Austin Texas and all you bought in Austin Texas was multif family and you bought multif family in all the right locations and your buildings are now 100% occupied your rents have been growing 10% a year you took out your 60% mortgage at 3 and a half% you were feeling great you were the best investor in the world what's your Equity worth today it's a math problem rents up cap rates up your Equity is worth 50 cents on the dollar were you a good investor well in 19 you were a really good investor in 20 you were a good investor in 21 people were not so sure in 22 you went to the bottom of the B and in 23 people are pretty convinced you were lucky not smart maybe we should use the words Enterprise software instead of Austin Texas maybe we've been living in tailwind and we have to learn to accept change I know in my organization a lot of the things that Adam just said uh we do there's active encouragement of intellectual insubordination which I distinguish from outright insubordination because that makes it difficult to run the business but there is no hierarchy for a good idea there is no ability uh to feel uncomfortable this is something we actively promote um I gathered U my partners um in Abu Dhabi in January every couple of years we get together and we talk about the future and I started with uh Apollo in 2008 Apollo in 2008 was 40 billion of AUM Apollo in 2023 was 650 billion of AUM we had grew 14 times we outgrew Apple we outgrew Microsoft I think we outgrew everyone other than Nvidia by the way all organic next question were we lucky or smart come on you guys know this we were lucky you can't possibly you can't possibly expect to grow a financial services business at 14 times we were smart only in that we were in the right place to prepare for Change and change happened think about the trends that drove us from 40 billion of AUM to 650 billion of AUM financial crisis in 2008 weakened most financial institutions they were playing defense rates going to zero pushed investors who had made promises to retirees to look for Alternatives those are the factors that drove our growth and so sitting in the beginning of 2024 I'm looking out and I'm saying to myself what where's change coming from how do we first accept that the success that we've had is based on a series of things that no longer exist how do we prepare the organization and to accept change what happens if we're wrong I think I'm wrong at least 40% of the time which would make me in baseball terms the the the most productive player ever well let's let's create an organizational culture that accepts that you can fail and fix your mistakes quickly let's not get let's not fire people for making bad decisions let's fire them for making no decision and that's I think what we've done so I sit out and I I think about uh what the team said this morning what you heard from uh Wellington what you heard from Helman and Freeman what you heard from Oak Tre and I think all of it is true and I'm going to add my gloss on top of it I think we as investors are not mindful enough of the massive change taking place and I think some of the change is predictable so I'll give you how we are building our business based on change on things that we observe 2008 we nearly destroyed the worldwide finan ccial system we implemented massive amounts of change none of us me included have yet to experience any of that change because right after we changed the rules we printed $8 trillion and everything went up and to the right we've now had about 18 months of living with change so what could we observe easy one are public markets liquid I don't think so maybe on the equity side that's true on the fixed income side no 2008 put an extreme penalty on Market making capital in fixed income in particular Market making capital is 10% of what it was today of what it was in 2008 markets are three times their size yes we are living with a 30th of the liquidity it now takes 5 days to sell an investment grade corporate bond outside the top 20 we've actually witnessed wholesale Market failure this cute little thing called ldi in the UK this was not some crazy thing UK institutions were doing this was a mistaken belief that they could sell AAA and doublea obligations at or near the market price they were wrong they started selling the price collapsed Bank of England ultimately had to step in should we actually think on a go forward basis that this is the norm that liquidity only exists on the way up it does not exist on the way down why do we want to be public why do we actually distinguish between public and private what is actually the difference between public and private it's not clear to me that there's any liquidity difference equities aside second big fundamental change 2008 most of the regulation around the world not just then But continuing to today has to reduce the role of banks in the economy everywhere in the world is going through de banking at different rates in the US Banks today are less than 30% of debt Capital investors are the other percentage every regulator every government everywhere in the world has two choices Capital can come from Banks or Capital can come from investors there's no third choice once you choose investors you have two more choices they can come from the daily liquid public markets or they can come from institutional private markets think about the priorities particularly in Europe energy transition climate change infrastructure everything I just mentioned is longterm why would we want that funded on a daily liquid basis wouldn't we want that funded in institutional markets to match liquidity where is systemic risk think about why banking is being disfavored banking is being disfavored in part because Banks borrow short and lend long do we really want more borrow short lend long by using more public markets or do we want private markets this whole rethink of the role of a bank the role of an investor is a massive change we as investors are going to experience products in the financial uh excuse me in the fixed income space that we've never seen before risk rewards products returns that have been locked on the balance sheets of financial institutions for the last 40 years are on their way to you as investment products we're all going to have to come overcome biases that we have about public and private other big change indexation and correlation do we have price Discovery in US markets I don't know 35% of 83% of the US market is S&P 500 10 stocks are 35% of the S&P those 10 stocks trade at a 45 PE today how many of us come in every day trying to buy 45 PE stocks probably none on the other hand think of the largest pool of capital in the world today12 trillion do sitting in 401K for us mid-market investors people who really need Returns what are these people invested in Daily liquid index funds for 50 years why why do we have people invested in Daily liquid index funds for 50 years and it'll go to where I think change is really coming we we are going through an entire evaluation of public versus private in my 40 years I certainly grew up thinking public is safe private is risky and for most of my career that's been true private was three products Venture Capital hedge funds and private Equity all three are risky public was safe in the US at least 8,000 public companies Diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds why what if that's not the case anymore what if private is both safe and risky and public is safe and risky how should we think about investing how should we think about portfolios most of us most institutions operate with a private bucket or an Alternatives bucket why don't you have a public bucket rather than a private bucket we went from 8,000 public companies in the US to 4,000 public companies and I would bet that's going to go down not up shouldn't we have half our money in private I think we've looked to private markets for rate of return because we've always perceived it as as more risky therefore more return is desired I think we're going to look to private markets for diversification I think to escape indexation and concentration I think we're going to look to private Market Market I think we're going to think the whole no rethink a whole notion of risk and reward the things that we've taken for granted that public is safe and that private is risky that banks are a sort of Deb financing that daily liquid by the way why do we have daily liquid funds I don't know why does an institution with a 20 or 40-year time Horizon concern itself with liquidity I don't know these are we are breaking taboo investors right now are confused and they're confused because they're looking back at history and they're saying this worked but what they're not yet willing to do is to question the fundamentals is the system totally different have things changed are we in the absence of Tailwinds am I willing to revisit underlying assumptions think about the following like coming back to the notion of price Discovery active management of equity is a really difficult business very few people do it really well have the discipline have 60 teams if I told you there was a market where for 20 years 93% of the participants fail to beat the index you would be concerned did these people get stupider I don't think so well has the structure of the market changed I think the structure of the market has changed I think the whole notion of daily liquidity is going to change we are betting it on that we've built a business that is 650 billion today which will be twice its size in 5 years based on a bet that investors are going to revisit how they think it is already happening so if you take the typical investor and I'll I'll take your portfolio but then I'll I'll simplify it um typical Institutional Investor that invests with us is 50 is% invested in public Equity daily liquid 30% invested in fixed income daily liquid and 20% in everything else why no one knows that's what we've done that's what's worked historically and we're actually watching this change in real time and the place it's changing first is in fixed income a sing a rated private security is that an alternative or is that fixed income I ask cios this question all the time it can stump them for an hour because we've all grown up thinking this thing doesn't exist we are watching institutional investors look at their fixed income portfolio and they are moving their fixed income portfolio not into public and private but into Alpha and beta we are going to watch a turnover of the the fixed income portfolio of institutional investors move into private markets and the reason that's happening is there's an Arbiter there's a rating agency someone can say this was a-rated this was a-rated you can pick up 200 basis points of yield for moving therefore we should move since we don't need the liquidity what about if the same were true in equity what if people took their 50% Equity bucket and they actually thought about diversification they thought about the number of public companies and rather than think about private Equity because private equity and I know the debate is taking place in this country in real time private Equity is lever Equity it's in a fund structure it produces some binary outcomes what if we talked about Equity that's private rather than private Equity that's going to be a harder move for people because there's no rating agency yet that is willing to allow people to talk across the spectrum of public and private and equal risk but that's the world we live in today more companies are going to be private people who are not invested in in equity that is private are missing out on half of the marketplace they are concentrating their portfolios the notion that their public portfolios have performed well in the past does not surprise me we are indexed and correlated we have been driven by money flows we've printed $8 trillion dollar in the US 100% of last year's return was essentially 10 stocks everyone has woken up and discovered that they own Nvidia apple and Amazon and Microsoft and is levered the same way it's not clear to me that that's sustainable and for me as a leader of a business I think Adam's notion of humble confidence uh is is actually a really good one we all are confronted with change we're all confronted with un un certainty but while we do the little things to deal with change and uncertainty and we we reflect contrary opinion and we allow for intellectual insubordination how many of us actually Force the organization to fundamentally rethink whether the things we think are true are true I want to challenge that I want all of you to think about that I don't think what we've grown up in exists anymore I don't think the financial system works the way we think it does I think liquidity is different the sources of debt are different indexation and correlation are different the whole notion of public and private are different and I don't think the strategies that we've employed over the past 40 years are going to work going forward that's a really uncomfortable thing for us to deal with because we're all used to doing due diligence and looking at track record looking at historical correlations it's not clear to me that that is any value thank you this has been [Music] [Applause] [Music] great thanks Mark for adding depth to our conversation and for flying all the way to Norway to speak to us the world's best investors believe there is one characteristic which is consistent in excellent investors and that is great Angela Duckworth is a Rosal Lee and Ebert Chang professor of psychology specializing in grit and self-control she's an academic a psychologist a popular science author Angela believes that it is in times of adversity that we see a separation of those that are good from the very best please help me in well welcoming Angela who's joining us online [Applause] [Music] today hello greetings from Philadelphia and thank you very much for having me uh it's my honor to follow Mark and to um say that you know in uh a climate of uncertainty and change um but also I would say you know historically across time that there has been a quality of the highest Achievers in every domain at least every domain that I have studied and that includes leadership um so I'd like to present to you today what I have discovered about what grit is why it's special and what this means especially in the leadership context um I want to say on a personal note that I grew up with a father who only talked about being a world class achiever literally that's all we talked about at breakfast at dinner on the weekends summer vacations um and my dad talked a lot um implicitly about how the highest Achievers were naturally talented they were smarter than everyone they were more gifted and what I grew up to learn as a psychologist is that Talent innate Talent especially had has nothing to do with grit let me show you four questions from the grit scale to give you a sense of what I'm talking about um here's an item that indexes your perseverance for long-term goals ask yourself whether if I talk to your closest colleagues whether they would rush to tell me that you are an especially hard worker um would they tell me that you uh finish whatever you begin um this item by the way um also an index of your person perseverance for longterm goals is the single most predictive item on the grit scale so this is probably what you think of when you think of grit someone who's really a hard worker also uh you know resilient in the face of setbacks they finish things when a lot of other people quit and I would tell you that that is half right because that is half of grit uh but grit is also passion for long-term goals and let me show you two items from the GR scale that index your passion for long-term goals and before you read them I need to warn you that they're reverse scor meaning that if you read them you say wow that's just like me that's how everyone would describe me then actually you get a lower passion score and a lower overall grit score for example I have difficulty maintaining my focus on projects that take more than a few months to complete or I often say a goal but later choose to pursue a different one uh given that I'm following Mark and his comments I do want to say importantly that when I study grit this combination of perseverance and passion for long-term goals I want to say on the passion element that in the context of uncertainty and change now more than ever what I what I mean about passion for long-term goals is a kind of steadfast and even stubborn dedication to some top level goals some it's usually very abstract it can even be um so abstract as to not be easily understandable by other people um but you want extreme agility and flexibility on how you're going to get there um and I think that reconciles in some ways the current environment of of uncertainty and change with this um Timeless character strength of grit now I said that in my research that I found grit and talent to be not at all related and that's exactly true in my research and in research from around the world when you measure IQ or other kinds of natural ability uh you find that IQ is great it predicts achievement but it's not correlated with grit which I think is at least as essential and I want to um share with you one personal um relationship that I have with a paragon of grit because I think he illustrates um how talent and grit are different and how grit in some ways unleashes uh the the talent that uh people have in order for them to accomplish great things um meet Toby Cosgrove Toby Cosgrove grew up he was a a very mediocre student uh turns out he had dyslexia a reading disability but um in those days they didn't have a word for it they just thought he was slow um but he wanted to be um a doctor and he eventually um got into medical school and he eventually graduated from medical school when it was time for him to choose his specialty um he wanted the hardest one so he he chose heart surgery and and it was the most competitive and everyone told him he couldn't do it um but Toby did it anyway um he was told while he was a resident in uh heart surgery cardiac surgery that he was the least talented individual there was um and uh he didn't disagree with that um but he believed that he could learn from his failures failure is a great teacher he said um and Toby went on to work and work and work at refining the craft of cardiac surgery um he said he was on a constant quest to find ways uh to do things better and I want to share one um very specific story from you know Toby's early years as a cardiac surgeon um he realized that there were other surgeons in the world who were far better than he was so he would uh go to see them he would get on a plane like Mark did and he would travel and he would stand in the operating theater not operating himself of course and he would take notes and he would watch like a hawk and these these Discovery trips um as he sometimes called them he would come back and then he would have a goal he would have a picture in his head of something he could do better than that he would try to do as as best he could and then to refine and refine and refine and to improve and I want to share with you how this links up to um what is sometimes called the 10,000 hour rule 10,000 hours of practice now it's a dark Auditorium and I'm in Philadelphia I'm not with you but I'd like you to raise your hand if you've ever heard this expression 10,000 hours of practice 10,000 hours you know makes you great at what you do well um uh I know it's not the same country but I do want to say that in Sweden there was born a scientist named Andre Ericson and um he was the scientist whose research became popularized as the 10,000 hour rule now Anders was a dear friend of mine he passed away several years ago um but he spent his entire life as a cognitive scientist trying to understand the learning curve of worldclass experts so Grand chess Masters Olympic gold medalist athletes prima ballerinas worldclass mathematicians etc etc and that expression that you've heard of 10,000 hours of practice comes from a single study just one of his studies that showed that at a German Music Academy the very best musicians those who would go on to recording contracts and um achieve worldclass prominence um they had on average about 10,000 hours of a certain kind of practice the next group had less of it maybe 7,500 hours and the worst group who were still pretty great because this was a selective German Music Academy they had maybe 5,000 now that became popularized as a kind of um heris a rule that the quantity of practice makes you great but I want to show you a different learning curve that Anders also discovered and this graph essentially summarizes his lifetime of insight into how to become world class at what you do you can put in 10,000 hours or 20,000 or even 40,000 hours of a different kind of practice a less effective kind of practice and actually stop improving unlike world-class experts I call this the plateau of Arrested Development and I think it makes the point that it's not just quantity of practice that makes you world class it's the quality of the practice you're doing now I want to unpack that for you very specifically because I think there's a lesson in that for every leader for every investor and indeed every performer who wants to get somewhat better every day at what they're doing before I unpack that I want to show you another learning curve um I have two daughters and I raise them to believe that life is a multiple choice question you have a choice of improving every single day at what you do that's the path to becoming a world-class expert there is plateauing at some level of mediocre performance you know you get better in your first year you get a little better in your second year but maybe in your fourth or fifth year you're just on autopilot that's probably most people and then there's a third choice for you in life and that is to drop out of what you're doing now especially given Mark's comments and my own um personal history and what I've learned as a scientist I want to emphasize to you today that dropping out is sometimes exactly the thing to do especially when there's some low-level goal some tactic some quarterly objective that's just not working out or when the opportunity cost exceeds what you're doing right now those are excellent reasons to drop out I played piano when I was a little girl and I'm so glad I quit because I wasn't very good at it and I didn't love it and I was able to take my time and devote it to something else but what you find about every world-class investor and every worldclass leader is that they eventually find something that they love enough to keep with it to stay improving and improving to have passion for that long-term top level goal that keeps them motivated now here is what Andre Ericson discovered about high quality practice it has three specific elements and they're quite easy to understand but maybe not easy to do in combination the first element is that you must decide on a very specific narrow aspect of your overall performance and you drill that in particular so uh if you if you ask an Olympic Athlete you know like you know a skier you know like what are you doing they're not going to say I'm skiing better they're going to give you a very technical answer that you probably only understand if you were also a world-class skier now they uh they do this usually with a coach helping them but when they practice they usually practice alone so Andre's discovered toward the end of his career that almost everyone needs a mentor to show them and to help them identify what to do next but when they do the work it is almost always uh alone uh so they can concentrate completely and and really pay attention to what they're doing so the second element is practicing with complete Focus the opposite of multitasking if you will and the third element is the hardest motivationally psychologic Ally I would say which is that you have to get feedback on what you're doing feedback on that performance and then to repeat the cycle again and I say it's the most difficult motivationally because if you tell me one thing that I could have done better for you today in my 15 minutes with you I will immediately be defensive I don't want to hear you criticize what I just did but if I ignore your feedback then I will never get better as a speaker and so this feedback is the essential element closing the feedback uh closing the learning Loop but also it's something that is the enemy of ego now if you are somebody like Toby cosgro if you do this kind of deliberate Practice Day in day out to become a better cardiac surgeon you have a top level goal let me show you what a hierarchy of goals looks like uh for somebody like like Toby Cosgrove all human beings have goals but what makes gritty people special is that there is a top level goal for which they have so much passion and perseverance that they don't give up for Toby that was to improve the patients lives that he was working with both the quality and the length of their life and to achieve that goal he had mid-level goals you know prevent cardiac conditions the treat the conditions coordinate care and then there were these low-level tactical goals that uh he should be more flexible and agile with but he should be very stubborn about the top level goal now I want to say what happened to Toby so he became uh arguably the best heart surgeon in the world he invented many procedures um that are still in use today um and then he became a leader uh he became a real leader and he um uh became the CEO of the Cleveland clinic now the Cleveland Clinic is um uh one of the world's most um renowned medical facilities and suddenly to had to understand how to lead with grit not just how to be a performer with grit but a leader with grit and I want to end with this Insight I believe that what a gritty organization is a gritty company for example is uh in a way it's a macrocosm of what a gritty individual is so there is still a top level goal there is a goal hierarchy with mid-level goals and low-level goals I believe that the top level goal in this case when Toby took over the Cleveland Clinic he made the top level goal put Patients First just those three words everybody walked around with buttons that said put Patients First when I talked to the uh secretaries and the custodians anybody at the Cleveland Clinic I said what's this place all about they said put Patients First every single one of them told me that now they all had different jobs right they all had different functions there was a hierarchy but there was this steadfast stubborn dedication to a top level goal and I want to say in conclusion that if you believe that Talent is not enough if you believe that it's not enough to be lucky if you believe that in addition you need to have passion and perseverance at the individual level as a performer you must also believe that you need that at the organizational level and that to me is the essence of leadership with Grit um in the words of the Great American writer Ralph Waldo Emerson any institution is the lengthen shadow of its leader when I find gritty leaders I find gritty organizations when I find gritty organizations I find gritty leaders there is a top level goal that motivates both and in on a personal note I will say the reason I am so delighted to be with you um is that I think Nikolai is uh truly a great leader uh he leads with grit and integrity and has been an example for me uh for many years so in friendship and in uh admiration I say thank you thanks to Angela for sharing her views who I'm sure is continuing to watch us life it is now time for break we all resume at 15:40 for our last session on behavorial aspects of excellent [Music] investors now we've heard a lot about what makes a great investor a great investor is someone who knows a company in depth some people go all the way when it comes to learning what the company is all about we sent one of our employees in the real world to check out some of the companies we own let us see how that went hi everybody live from McDonald's today really good best fries now in the fund we own shares the equivalent to 400 million Big Macs now when you see me with a football you're probably going to mistake me for H on and we are nearly from the same place in Norway but not not quite just uh put on my really really good uh sliders today with my very typical Norwegian socks going into some proper deep learning here we are folding Pizza books that only took me 5 minutes in the podcast one of the things we spend a lot of time on the secret source and you know what in this case here it is re perhaps a little a bit a little bit too much tomato sauce love it I think we put on a bit [Music] more I guess Nikolai should have listened to our next speaker a little bit more when it came to quitting on that tomato sauce because our next speaker is a master of knowing when to quit Annie Duke is a worldclass poker player but she's also the author of the bestselling book quit she's here with us today joining us online welcome to Annie [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] hi everyone I'm so happy to be here virtually uh I'm going to talk to you today about quitting and particularly how do we improve our exit decisions and why do we really want to do that so the problem that we have as decision makers is that uncertainty makes it very hard uh to start things uh and that's because there's two forms of uncertainty that are exerting themselves on any decision that we make the first is just plain luck uh which means that we can make a great decision we can make a decision that's going to work out 90% of the time but 10% of the time it's not going to work out uh and when we observe that 10% is wholly determined by luck and that makes it very hard for us to start things because we're we're trying to get more control than we actually have over what the outcome might be uh which is probabilistic in nature the other form of uncertainty that makes the decision to start things hard is that we know very little in comparison to all there is to be known and so this can make it uh so that we really slow our decisions down in a way that isn't actually productive trying to get to a level of certainty that is actually unattainable so those two forms of uncertainty are making starting things hard the good news for us is that for most things that we decide to do we have the option to quit later uh that quit might have varying varying costs associated with it but almost anything that we decide to start we can actually quit and what that means is that the uncertainty that that makes it really hard for us to start things this option to quit later makes that start easier because we can anticipate the ability to exit when we observe that the world isn't going in our direction or when we observe that we're getting signals that we're learning new things that tell us that our choice wasn't actually that good so you can think about it like we've all had that feeling of I wish I knew then what I know now uh the option to quit actually makes it so that we can act on that feeling when we learn new information but here's the really big problem is that even though we have this incredibly valuable option and I would actually argue that it's the single most valuable option that we have in decision- making is this option to walk away the problem is that we actually are quite bad at quitting um we tend to walk away from things uh much too late compared to when if you were just judging expected value would be the correct time to actually walk away so we're going to talk about this problem that we have with quitting uh we're going to talk about why it is that we uh have such a problem with quitting and then I'm going to hopefully give you some solutions that are going to make this all a little bit easier for you okay so here's the important thing remember I said after we start things we get new information and we have this very strong intuition that when we get information from the world that things aren't going that well we'll actually pay attention and walk away so when we get those adverse signals we're going to stop what we're doing and that's what we all think but that intuition is actually wrong instead in the face of those negative signals we escalate our commitment and actually in reference to the previous speaker I use mountain climbing as an example for this we've all heard of fever we have the intuition that if it gets dark and we're still climbing or if a blizzard is coming in uh that we're all going to stop climbing uh and it turns out that we don't and you can just look to for example uh 1996 on Mount Everest to know that people will continue past the point when they already have um adverse signals 1996 being that tragic year uh when Rob Hall and Doug Hansen died so this is uh this is a well uh known effect it's called escalation of commitment that we get these signals and instead of actually reducing our commitment to the cause having gotten those adverse signals we actually escalate our commitment to the cause and of course continuing to do something that is no longer worthwhile doesn't just have costs associated with doing something that's negative expectancy itself but there are also opportunity costs associated with it so we have this added cost of failure to cut our losses that we can't take that cap capit our time Attention our money our effort and put it into something that would actually be worthwhile so one of the ways that we can think about the uh grit and quit is not as oppositional but is kind of the same decision uh we should stick to things that are worthwhile and we should quit things that aren't and the failure to quit things that are no longer worthwhile also has opportunity costs associated with it so this becomes even more important to get this quit grit quit decision down now this is really important experts are in no way immune to escalation of commitment they're no way in no way immune to this failure to quit things on time there is lots and lots of data and I've got three studies shown here Garvey and Murphy uh Woodcock so and so forth that show that while expert investors are alpha generators when putting risk on they give Alpha back on their exit decisions uh and in fact this 2023 paper shows that uh endowments when they put positions on are generating between 120 and 180 bips on those uh an alpha on those decisions but their exit decisions they're actually giving about 70 to 80 bips back uh uh Woodcock and then also Garvey and Murphy talk about the the fact that uh intraday Traders are also uh finding this and Alexus has shown this as well uh very very good on the entry uh giving a lot of that Alpha back on the exit and that's why I think this option to quit is so incredibly valuable because this is the place where we can actually pick up we can generate a lot of alpha uh compared to our to compared to our competitors so why is it that it's so hard for us to quit things well it turns out that there's a lot of cognitive biases that kind of pile up on top of us that make us slow to quit I'm going to walk through some of them pretty quickly I'm not going to cover every single one of them uh but with the some cost effect endowment status quo bias Omission commission bias optimism bias loss aversion andure loss aversion so I'm going to walk through these somewhat quickly uh the sun cost effect uh is when we take into account what we've already spent on something and deciding whether to continue on and spend more in other words what happens is that we have that feeling of we want to get our money back or we don't want to have wasted uh what we already put into something the problem of course is that waste is not a retrospective problem it's a prospective problem what we'd ideally like to do uh is if it is something that we would start today then we should be willing to continue it if it is not something that we would start today then we should not continue it but what happens with sun cost is that instead of this Forward Thinking where we're saying is this something that we would actually do start today would we put this position on today for example we take into account what we've already put into it and deciding whether to continue on and and spend more now the problem is it doesn't really matter uh what you've lost coming up to that moment of the decision what matters is whether the next dollar or the next unit of effort that we put into something is positive expectancy so the sunk cost effect causes us to continue things that are no longer worthwhile we also have the endowment effect which is just we value things that we own more than identical things uh that we don't own so the things that we already have in our portfolio the positions that we already have on this is even true of our own ideas uh the thesis that we're trading uh the ideas that we have we value more than things that don't we don't own so obviously when we're making that decision about whether it's worthwhile to continue on we're going to distort our view of what the expected value is uh just because we think that the things that we own are more valuable that they have more value to them um then we have sh loss aversion this comes from the late Danny Conan and and Amos tersi uh which is essentially this problem that we're biased against converting paper losses into realized losses and we'll actually pay to avoid having to do so so this is from their original 1979 paper on prospect theory uh which shows that when people are in the losses on a gamble uh say I've lost $100 um and I'm offered a Fair coin flip uh where I can either get even or I'll lose $220 that they'll prefer to take the flip there in other words they're paying $10 for the opportunity to try to get even and that's because of this aversion to turning a paper loss into a sure loss and obviously that's a huge problem when we're in the losses on a position that we're holding and we can kind of think of all of those under this umbrella of we just don't like to close accounts in the losses and it's not just paper accounts this has to do with our mental accounts so we can have a paper account that's in the gains and yet our mental account is in the losses if we buy a stock at 50 it goes up to to 75 and then it goes down to 60 mentally we're in the losses even though on our paper Ledger we're in the gains and so this problem with not wanting to close accounts in the losses makes us very slow to quit we also have status quo bias a preference for sticking with the status quo Omission commission bias we're much more tolerant of losses that come from sticking with the status quo in other words making a decision not to switch uh as opposed to making a decision to switch so if we're holding a position we're going to be be more tolerant of the losses that might generate from that uh then we are going to be tolerant of generating from losses uh that come from us switching from that position to something new which also makes us very slow to quit and then the last thing is just cognitive ident dissonance identity and validity both both uh the way we view ourselves and the way that other people uh view us uh we want to be seen as consistent individuals over time uh part of the decisions that we make create part of our identity and that's particularly true if those decisions are making us stand out from the crowd so Bashir and and Milkman showed that when analysts take positions that are non-consensus uh on earnings forecasts uh when they're non-consensus and the World Turns against them and gives them information that their forecast actually wasn't correct they'll actually double down on the forecast but when they make uh when they make uh forecasts that are in consensus they're perfectly willing to change according to what the world tells them and that's because the non-consensus uh forecasts are actually much more part of somebody's identity and obviously as Traders um or as investors we're investing against the market uh so we're often trying to stand out from the crowd do something where we think that the market is not efficient and that makes it actually much harder for us to walk away because it's an attack on our identity if we actually have to jump ship okay so I told you a lot of the reasons why we don't stop now I want to give you quickly a few reasons how we can help you to get better at these stopping decisions the first is to set very specific kill criteria which are just criteria for killing a project cutting your losses or changing a plan uh so the first step is to identify the way that things might go wrong or right uh and then identify the early warning signals to develop a list of kill criteria in other words what are those signals that I think I might ignore in the future that would tell me that it's time to walk away and then pre-commit to your reaction to those criteria so I've worked with a lot of investors and they have that intuition while I have a thesis uh and let's say the thesis has to do with uh the directional movement of interest rates so they their thesis is that interest rates are going to go above above a certain uh uh Point um or stay within a particular band or go down whatever that thesis is they have the intuitions that that when interest rates move against them that they will get off the position that they will take risk off uh but we know that they don't they tend to get thesis creep or they escalate our commitment or they say now it's really cheap I know my forast is still correct uh and so um what I'm doing here is saying okay if you have a thesis that thesis is implying certain things about what the world is going to look like in the future write down what that thesis is actually implying and then develop kill criteria in other words if interest rates move out of a certain band then I will do X Y or Z so if they go above a certain band maybe I'll put more risk on but if they go below a certain band that means that the world has moved against my thesis and I need to actually take the risk off now that might seem like a distinction without a difference if I have a thesis it's predicting certain things about the future uh why is it different if I just write those things down and pre-commit to them and it turns out just cognitively that makes a huge difference uh to think ahead actually identify what those kill criteria are and then and then pre-commit to to the actions that you're going to take when you see those signals develop the next thing is to create better feedback loops one of the problems that we have on the quits when we take risk off is that we really don't have a good feedback loop on how those decisions compare to a benchmark so we consistently track positions we have on and obviously because they're in our portfolio we also even uh track positions that we're considering putting on because we'll create Shadow books but what we don't do is consistently track positions that we take off so what we want to do is create a benchmark W against which we can actually measure the quality of our quitting decisions so we can do that in a couple ways one thing is for example if we're freeing up Capital uh we can create a benchmark which is what if I randomly freed this Capital app from anywhere in my portfolio and actually judge my quit decision against that over the course of a period of time uh you can also actually start to uh track your your um uh things that you hold and look at uh what would have happened if I had actually sold those things earlier at the time that I considered it but be creative and try to actually create benchmarks against which you can actually start to judge your quitting decisions so that you can start to get feedback on whether you're generating Alpha on those exit decisions or giving Alpha back on those exit decisions and the last is uh this is a big favorite of mine go get yourself a quitting coach because an honest broker someone who's standing on the outside looking in on your situation is going to see your situation more clearly than you can and the reason is that they're not carrying all of the sunk cost they're not carrying the endowment they don't they don't have the same kind of biases piled up on them that are making them not be able to see that situation so clearly so someone from the outside looking in is going to see your situation more clearly than you can and so if you work with them to pre-commit to an exit plan with a quitting coach it actually makes it more likely that you'll follow through so they can both see the decision more clearly than you can and they create accountability that are going to make you actually follow through on those quitting plans so actually when I've worked with for example solo PMS I've paired them together so that they can coach each other on these exit decisions so I hope that this uh bit about exiting uh you're going to find helpful uh I really believe that this could be the the single biggest uh Alpha generator for you right now in your own investing life uh because we are so bad at it and nobody's really paying attention to how good these exit decisions are so if you can get better at these exit decisions I think this is G this uh will vastly improve your returns thank you so much so a great thanks to Annie for sharing thoughts on how and when to quit it's a pleasure to introduce the next speaker Michael maosin from Morgan Stanley Michael is an Wall Street investment strategist he's an author and he is an Adjunct professor at Columbia business school now Michael is known for his ability to turn complex idas into strikingly simple language so with that Michael [Applause] [Music] please good afternoon everybody it's really great to be with you the goal of my session is to talk about two very specific blocks to potentially poor decisions and what the best investors do to overcome them the goal of session two is to be very practical I hope when you go back to your desks you'll immediately be able to implement some of these ideas and ultimately make better decisions Adam Grant mentioned earlier today the good judgment project a project at University of Pennsylvania on forecasting turns out they did something very interesting when forecasters uh volunteered to participate in their project they either uh in control gave them no training or they gave them some training and the question was did the training make them better at making better forecasts and the answer to that was yes but it's actually somewhat qualified there are different flavors of training that have different impacts the first is just giving people information about heuristics and biases and it turns out you could do a couple experiments it turns out it's really fun for people they enjoy it and then they walk back to their desk they do exactly what they were doing before so it doesn't change any Behavior the two that we want to focus on is process so very specific tools and techniques we can't um work on to uncover biases and then finally giving people feedback certainly a theme that's coming through a lot today there is a little bit on formats so how you can reframe problems I'll give you one example that's a little bit in that in that flavor but we're going to focus mostly on process and feedback so let's jump into this I think the first very big barrier to making good decisions is the notion of overconfidence and I think the best investors are are very good at overcoming this now it turns out overconfidence which is often considered the root of all problems comes again in different varieties the first I'll say the the very bottom is this idea of overplacement people think of themselves as better than they are versus others so you've all heard this you know I'm above average driver or my sense of humor is better than 90% of other people the other is idea of overestimation which people absolutely think they're better at certain tasks you know so I can make this seven foot foot put or whatever it is so overplacement but the one that we're most interested in I think is this concept of overprecision we actually think we understand the future better than we actually do and I think the really good investors are those that can combat and overcome that let me give you an example of how this works this is a sort of a test of calibration and some degree a test of overconfidence um by the way the URL is down there if you can't find it or see it just let me know it's a very fun exercise to do in your own organization or with your loved ones it's a it's 50 true false questions some of which you'll know the answer to many of which you will not know the answer to so you answer true false and then you give a confidence 100% means I know the answer to this question 50% means I don't know the answer and I'm guessing right so this is the basic setup now we've had now about 20,000 people do this exercise and this is the scatter plot of all the responses by the way I do want to mention two and I'm sure they're guys I'm going to mention two guys that are my two favorite dots the one is the upper right hand corner which is 100% correct and 100% confident so this this guy Googled everyone and like the second guy that was even better is in the bottom right hand corner who is 35% correct and 95% confident you just H true true true true you do better than that guy did now the goal of this exercise is not to be right about every question if you can be right that's great but the goal of the exercise as you might imagine is to know what you know and to know what you don't know the goal of the exercise is to lie as close to the 45 degree angle line as possible now even people in the very back in the room can probably see this when I give you the numbers you won't be shocked to hear this the average confidence is 70% and the average correct is about 60% people are 10 percentage points overconfident in their own judgments now let's unpack that a little bit to see if there's anything interesting well the first is the distribution of overconfidence versus underconfidence by the way I mentioned this 10% overconfidence it turns out the the the standard deviation is also 10 so it's a beautiful shaped Bell distribution when you have this many people and about 82 82 83% of people are overconfident that's something we see very consistently by the way as a side note and I'm glad you're all sitting to hear this information men tend to be more overconfident than women and young men tend to be more confident than older men so there's some patterns there now this is where it gets really interesting it turns out that uh how do people answer when they're doing this exercise right so again you're getting 50% means I guess I don't know the answer to 100% so it turns out when people don't know the answer they they know they don't know the answer and they answer they don't know the answer so they're actually pretty they about 40% of the aners is is I don't know which is fine what's fascinating is the second most common response is I've got this I'm 100% sure I know the answer so between I have no idea what's going on and I know the answer is about two-thirds of all responses and people are very sparing in using those intermediate ranges by the way as Adam was talking about super forecasters he alluded to this but super forecasters are much better at updating their views and being more uh granular and actually setting their for casts okay so how do people do given their confidence well this is the most fascinating chart turns out when people don't know the answer again they don't they answer they don't answer and they're pretty well calibrated at I don't know but as you move from left to right on this chart you see this systematic departure from the 45 degree angle line when people are 100% sure they know the answer they're only right 77% of the time when they are 90% sure they're only right 2third of the time right there's this yawning Gap especially in this range of I am very sure what's going on Howard marks remarked about this just this morning that this is the sort of the Mark Twain thing when you're very confident about something you're wrong about it this is where trouble can can arise this is also very very important for uh portfolio construction concepts by the way there's an interesting uh just this there's a brand new paper about this but there's a new survey there's a there's a group called the survey of professional uh forecasters that forecast economic things this is unemployment rates and interest rates and so forth and they have a data set going back to 1968 so 55 or 60 years of data on this and it's the exact same thing they say what's going to happen with this thing with some sort of probability and here again these are professional forecasters and here you see this exact same pattern unfold high confidence uh poor conviction now why is this uh you know what's it what's exciting about this on the other hand is uh going back to the concept of feedback is it turns out when people get feedback on their forecast they get better at it over time so this is a picture of actually weather forecasters the the line the line at the bottom is actually the first year they did this and these are large sample sizes and then the next year they repeated the exercise with the feedback from the first year and you can see they got markedly better so this should be very encouraging to all of us that if we practice and get the feedback we get better at this right but keeping track of your decisions is really crucial to this okay so what's going on how can we improve broadly speaker what are the best investors do uh Annie mentioned Danny conoman we all mourn his loss he was extraordinary but one of the concepts of Danny popularize is this idea of the inside versus the outside view see the inside inside view says when I give you a problem it could be any kind of problem the classic way to solve this see if this makes sense to you is you gather lots of information you combine it with your own experience and then you project into the future right left door devices that's what we do information my experience what's going to happen in the world the outside view by contrast says I'm going to think about my problem as an instance of a larger reference class I'm going to ask what happen when other people were in this situation before it's a very unnatural way to think about the world right because you have to leave aside your chairish information and you have to find an appeal to the base rate what psychologists like Conan have demonstrated is some combination of the inside and the outside view um lead to better forecasts let me give you one example from the world of business this is pelaton right and this is an analyst report that was written in September 2020 so please roll your mind back three and a half years to the middle of the pandemic they were doing they were doing great because everybody wanted to exercise while they were at home they had just come finished a blockbuster year 2020 and the analyst wrote his report that our base case scenario they're going to grow Revenue 30% for the next decade and by the way it's a very I mean I'm tell the guy it's a serious model he's got it's all built out you know it's like it's actually quite incedible so there's that his inside view now the question you are going to ask hopefully using the Danny conman mindset is how many companies with $2 billion of turnover grew 30% a year for 10 years and here are the data on this I put the peleton bike the actual the guy's forecast um but you could see the average is about 6% the standard deviation is a little bit more than that this is the guy's base case so you might say if he's wildly optimistic he should certainly have a scenario for that but that certainly would not be your base case right so this gives you an example of how you might temper that there's a great quote from Danny conman by the way which really applies to investor he says people who know uh information about their own individual circumstances feel no need effectively to appeal to the base case the reference class to which it belongs right you feel like I've done the work I don't need to know what happened in the rest of the world when we know combining these two things is very powerful so why do we do this uh a few reasons one is Annie just mentioned one of them one is called uh three Illusions one is called the illusion of superior it we tend to think of ourselves as better than those around us by the way why do I have a picture of Mother Teresa 25 years ago US News and Ro report did a survey of thousand Americans and they said what's the probability of going to heaven and they talked about like they ask about Michael you know Michael Jordan and all these people anyway Mother Teresa scored 79% which seemed a little low to me by the way she's now a saint so maybe people bump it up but this is the best Mother Teresa 79 they said you uh survey answer what is the probably you go to heaven 87% Mother Teresa I promise you I would not answer higher than brother Teresa um the second is the illusion of optimism it tends to be we tend to be very optimistic about uh our our outcomes that are important to us and so as a consequence we tend to over calibrate our success and then the illusion of control this is good and when we when we deem ourselves in control situation we think our odds and success are much higher than they are objectively uh turns out when they go to Las Vegas watch people rolling dice when they want High numbers they throw them really hard when they want low numbers they throw them very gently doesn't work by the way but just this idea of being in control of the situation here's the last thing I'll say in this which you can all relate to which is statist this is statistical thinking and it turns out in the real world what carries the day are stories your parents told you stories you tell stories to your children stories move people stories teach people stories are memorable statistics are not so this is an interesting experiment where they went to people they said you have a disease you have a treatment alternative it's always 50/50 so you have that in your back pocket and then they said we're going to give you or they're going to show you one of four Alternatives 30 50 70 or 90% probability of success so this is you see one of those but the key is they paired it with a story that was positive negative or neutral about someone like you right so hopefully I'm making myself clear's got 5050 you're getting 30 neutral K so here let me just draw your attention to the extremes if you give people a positive anecdote they select the 30% Effectiveness now 30 versus 50 they selected almost eight out of 10 times if you give them a negative anecdote they select the 90 now 90 vers 50 they select it less than four out of 10 times the stories swamp the statistics in people making decisions by the way extremely important as Leaders very important for you as you think about stocks and narratives that go around them let me now turn to the second U major problem this is very much involved with what Annie was just talking about uh I'm going to say it's confirmation bias confirmation bias as you all know even if you struggle to make a decision once you've made a decision you seek information that confirms your point of view and you discount dismiss or disavow information that does not support your point of view now there's a very interesting point about confirmation bias it turns out almost all the biases heris and biases that are out there that con and trki identified are mitigated to some degree by intelligence so if you're you're a smarter person on average you learn about them you tend to do better the one that that's not true Forest confirmation bias this affects everybody no matter who they are and how bright they are 2005 was the first chance I ever had to meet Danny Conan it was an extraordinary day an extraordinary session at the very end of him I said Danny if there's one thing a investor can do to improve his or her results what would it be without hesitation he said you must keep a journal of your decisions write down what you think is going to happen why you think it's going to happen he said WR write the date and time he said by the way note how you feel physically and emotionally about this but the most important thing is as you're expressing your variant perception as you're expressing your view that's different than what's in the market for an investment for specifically he said communicate using probabilities not words because if you use words they're going to be vague enough that you can uh massage them after the fact but if it's a probability it allows you to keep score and here's one thing I would say if you're going to do a probabilistic forecast you want three elements one is an outcome that we can agree upon second within a specific period of time and then with some probability probability so you might say for example weather is a good for example Tomorrow there's an 80% chance it's going to rain tomorrow right so that would satisfy that if you have those three ingredients you are in business for doing uh probabilistic forecasts now to give you some sense of how Wild this can be uh I did a survey with my older son we U asked 20 we put out 23 common words or phrases to a population of people and we asked them say what's the associated probability you'd assign to this word or phrase and what you can see the answers are all over the place especially with the cognate now this is for maybe n native English speakers but the cognate possible if you say something as possible people interpret this in extraordinarily wide ranges so the reason you want to avoid words like that it's a serious possibility we'll have a recession next year whatever it is is because a you're not going to be able to keep track of your forecast and you're going to weas a out of it after the fact but B if you're communicating with someone they may hear something very different than what you mean and that's crucial now the last aspect of this is uh this came up a little bit before but I think it's fascinating in in Adam's com this guy I love his name is Keith stanovich he's a developmental psychologist uh most recent Meritus at the University of Toronto he's written a lot of books but he wrote a book in 2009 called what intelligence tests Miss it's not the snappiest book title of all time but it's veryy descriptive of the content and what he argues is there's this thing called IQ and you know more of it tends to be better than less of it that's fine and there's a thing he calls RQ rationality quotient the ability to make good decisions he says that's really what's important and and they're kind of on different sliders and we all know this right you've all gone to school people did really well in school and not so well in life and we all know people are not very good in school but very good at life this is this RQ IQ so what is RQ all about it turns out there are two components to it one is called instrumental rationality which is a fancy way of saying you can achieve your objectives given your constraints the way we think about this in economics is the axum's utility Theory the second one's one I think we care about that is this idea called epistemic rationality it's a fancy word of saying how accurately do your beliefs map to the world and by the way you woke up this morning with a certain set of beliefs of how the world works you wandered around this information confirmed it some information may have disconfirmed it what did you do in the face of that evidence so here's a quote from Phil techlock which I love and you heard this earlier today in a different form beliefs are hypotheses to be tested not Treasures to be protected the best investors take that to heart beliefs are hypotheses to be tested not Treasures to be protected let's do this together ready late in the day here's an example of how we might do this right this is um an example of how this works in integrating information so imagine hope I can read this imagine a zapper virus causes a serious disease that occurs in one in every thousand people say there's a a um a test that can detect perfectly if you have the virus you're going to you're going to be uh test positive additionally let's say that the test actually has a 5% false positive so if you don't have it it's going to say you have it one in every 20 time 5% false positive okay so now we choose a person at random we know nothing about his or her medical history and that person tested tests positive for the zapper virus what is the probability from 0 to 100% that that person has the virus us right so the test 1,000 test is perfect 5% fals positive we have someone that has the virus what's the probability anybody know this one but notice you have like these numbers in your head it's confusing but what you're doing is integrating various pieces of information and the answer is just a bit under 2% and let me explain how to come up with that very quickly in and in way it's easy to reframe the problem let's say there are a thousand people we're going to test all of them first person we're going to test the person that has the virus they test positively put them in the denominator we're then going to test the other 999 5% of which will test positive we put them in the denominator so now our denominator is 51 we said we picked one person at random they tested positive one over 51 that's your 2% right when I say it that way it's easy to follow no but you're integrating different pieces of information and that's what great investors were able to do quite effortlessly here's the last thing this ties together a bunch of things earlier from Adam and also from what Annie just talked about this is something called Lynch pen analysis this comes from the intelligence Community when you're looking at investment idea what you want to do is identify the key issues that are really important for that for most stocks or even asset classes two or three things tend to be important pinpoint the working assumptions behind that so-called Lynch pin premises um Advanced evidence for or against that and this is where you can come up with things like The Devil's Advocate and then any indicators or signposts right so the way you can do this to say we have a variant perception here's what we believe is going to happen and you write it all down in advance the key to these sign post is that kill criteria that Dan was talking about so I know in advance if I have a thesis that's different than the market I should have these I should pass these signposts on the road and if I don't then I must change my mind about what's going on and then last by the way I did this with Chad I was very proud of myself I did this with Chad GPT so this is like my my generative AI thing but this is just a Winding Road this is how I really Envision it that you see these signposts as you go along and if your thesis is correct you should anticipate seeing those signposts and if you don't see the signpost you expect that is an opportunity or in fact really a challenge to change your view so that let me stop what the best investors do is calibrate well to start they do that primarily by appealing to base rates and second of course when new information encourages you or forces you to change your mind you should change your mind when appropriate thank you very much thank you very much Michael that was very interesting and we will all take your test I'm 100% confident about it and I've written it down okay our next um next guest is a real legend Mark andreon probably the best Venture capit list the world has ever seen hi Mark good to see you again hello good morning how's everybody we are really well thank you now Mark where are we going to make money going forward well so in our business uh the theory is relatively straight forward which is uh we make money on technological disruption um and so we we make money when these new up start uh startups uh form and uh you know either either try to go take down a big incumbent or try to create some kind of New Market um and so that's what we do um I I think for the World At Large uh the you know the challenge is just that there's a fundamental uh uh Supply demand imbalance between the amount of capital um you know that's seeking productive uh economic investment opportunities um and then the the number of those opportunities and so I think there's a a very large macro problem uh on making money in the economy um and and and and Tech and Venture Capital can only be a small part of that answer but but hopefully we will be a part of that answer yeah well you are sitting in the middle of Silicon Valley and you kind of invented the internet so um kicking off the the AI question just how how will the AI raise pan out here yeah so the the the theory and the Hope um certainly that we're betting that we're betting against and investing hard against um is that is that Ai and specifically these new breakthroughs around AI like like generative AI uh represent a new platform and in the in the tech industry that's a sort of very powerful concept uh because the idea of a new platform in the tech industry is sort of a new foundational technology um that you can then imagine Reinventing thousands and thousands of application categories on top of and and the the the tech industry historically um has been fueled by these platforms you know the original one was the Mainframe computer that then led to mini computers client server computers personal computers mobile uh mobile computers um and every time there's a platform shift There's an opportunity to reinvent the industry and reinvent basically the entire ecosystem and and all the different ways that people use technology and and create an entirely new generation of companies um and so we we certainly believe that AI is is is a is a new platform shift we believe that AI one of the really big platform shifts we we think this you know might the possibility exists that this is on par with the microprocessor um and so you know we think there's an opportunity to take a very broad uh perspective here and invest in many different um both core Technologies and also uh use cases of of AI where is the where is the kind of fight going on just now what uh is it about chips or money or people or electricity just what exactly is it yeah so the the most dramatic thing about this this sort of AI shift um is that it's it's it's what I call an 80-year overnight success um and so the original paper on neural networks which are the foundational technology of AI was actually written in 1943 um and then you had over the course of the last 80 years you had entire generations of researchers who who basically try to make AI work and for the most part weren't weren't able to do it um in fact when I when I was in school you know 35 years ago a AI was a was a discredited field because there had been an AI boom in the 80s that that that didn't pan out um and so it's it's an it's a it's a technology sector that's sort of been in search of of working products for a long time um essentially what happened was the Breakthrough moment was in 2022 and it was the it was the chat GPT moment um and so it was you know it's actually 7 79 years into the technology but it was a breakthrough moment and then it was a breakthrough moment of it went basically from not working to working incredibly well in one step and you know the the technolog is not perfect yet there's still a lot of work to be done but it fundamentally you know these products are just incredible already in what they can do and and they're far better out of the gate than the than you know the microprocessor was or than the internet was um and so it's this kind of rare situation where you have this dramatic leap and functionality happening extremely quickly um as a result of that basically every part of the tech EOS system is trying to react and trying to figure out how to incorporate AI or trying to build on AI or trying to you know basically compensate you know figure out how to how to compensate for weaknesses in AI um every single sector of the tech industry is reacting right now um there is a you know massive chip you know shortage this the biggest Supply to balance Supply demand IM balance and ships that we've ever seen as an industry um and so there's a massive fight happening there there's a mass massive you know wave of data center Innovation development there's actually power a lot of people are now trying to figure out how to power and cool these giant data centers there's actually a Resurgence of interest and nuclear power um around these data centers um and then there's there are there are basically fights happening up and down the software stack you know the the fight gets probably the most publicity at the moment is the fight between the software companies building the so-called Foundation models um and so and there there's sort of a big fight between a view of the world in which there will be a few big models that basically win everything and then an alternate view of the world which this is more like the microprocessor and there will actually be you know many you know thousands of different models running on billions of devices um you know of many different shape sizes descriptions customized in various ways um and and actually that that latter thesis is the thesis we're investing against very aggressively now you said last year that we should just stuff AI into everything we do like weapons cars everything in order to beat the Chinese what do you could you tell us about it yeah there's there's sort of two policy debate happening around AI um you know somewhat somewhat for sure in the EU but for sure in the US um and and there's sort of one policy debate which is you know AI is sort of weird and scary and we should regulate it and we should kind of prevent it from happening in different ways and you know the EU has put in place these kind of very onerous regulations the UK has followed and then there's a big fight happening in US politics around this um and so this is sort of an inward-looking you know kind of domestic policy uh Viewpoint and people have all all these all these fears around AI um there's a completely different conversation which is the geopolitical conversation and that's the that's the conversation of basically you know geopolitical competition with China um and of course you know the minute you get into that conversation it becomes very clear that we need to win um and and specifically the reason we need to win is we need to win we need to win the AI race with China you know sort of a very analogous way that we won the you know the sort of Technology race with the Soviet Union um you know in in the previous Century which is you know we have two basically two basically dominant you know mindsets regimes of you know Western democracy and and and and Chinese communism um you know that both have aspirations to to to transform the world um you know both of those are are supported by a major you know major nation states both of those are supported by Major militaries both of those are supported by Major economies and both of those are supported by Major Tech Industries um and if you look at the pre precedent of the cold war with the Soviet Union the reason the West won was because of sort of a triangle of technological superiority economic superiority and then and then and then National Security Military Intelligence superiority um but you know we we decided we wanted to win and and and we won right and by the way our Victory ended up actually being great for the the people of Russia right it was actually really great for the Soviet Union to fall and and you know people people in Russia are much better off today um and so you know I think this is very straightforward like we we need to win we need to win by being better technologically better economically and better militarily AI has been identified as the core technology uh for the future of the nation state by both US military planners by the Pentagon um as well as by uh you know the the the Chinese planners and so it will be one of the main areas uh in which these you know these kind of two the two hemispheres compete and and and I think it's important that we win where do you think the West is now relative to China so the West has I would say all of the advantages and disadvantages of a decentralized system uh and a market economy and a and a sort of a system in which governments don't control everything um and you know the huge advantage of that is innovation and Entrepreneurship the disadvantage of that is you know very it's very difficult for our systems to plan you know there you know there is no top- down American Technology strategy there is no top- down European technology strategy those concepts are kind of you know antithetical to our systems uh and so we're very robust and dynamic in general um but you know we're very messy um the Chinese have both the advantages and the disadvantages of a centralized system much like the Soviet Union did um you know they have a command and control system where the Communist party you know owns and controls everything and they can direct their private companies to do whatever they want which they're doing right now you know with sort of increasing Force um and then they have all the disadvantages of of a centralized system which is you know they have they have a command system um you know they're actually in the process of trying to crush their entrepreneurial system right now they're you know they're trying to basically Drive their entrepreneurs you know out of out of uh you know in many cases out of business in many cases out of the country um and so it's it's it's like like the cold war with the Soviet Union it's it's an asymmetric situation each side brings strengths and weaknesses and then I would say you know each side is tempted to embrace the model of the other side to try to get the advantages so the Chinese have kind of this fake entrepreneurial system uh you know that they kind kind of try to Foster and then we have this sort of you know you know sort of U not very effective you know Central planning function um you know in in in DC and in Brussels uh you know that doesn't work very well and and at least would argue we should lean into the strengths of our system um and you know and and try to benefit from the fact that we should have a much more Dynamic economy we should have much more entrepreneurship um and and hopefully that that's what we'll do talking of um dynamism you when we met you also talked about the importance of investing in American dynamism and I guess that also goes for European dynamism what what do you mean by that yeah so you know look the the this is sort of part of you know this is part of the challenge for the the geopolitical conflict as well as our our domestic issues and so you know look both both the US in EU I mean we're we're we're you know we are the result of the Industrial Revolution right we're a result of the first Industrial Revolution with things like steam power we're the result of the Second Industrial Revolution you know with things like electricity where the result of the of the computer age you know the the the West represented by the US and Europe is where you know most of these Technologies over the last you know 300 years were developed um and and historically our society's benefited enormously by this you know we we have the highest standards of living you know our our you know our children over time have you know have done the best and and and generally it's been a very you know synergistic positive uh process um you know in the last 50 years I think both American society and EU Society has sort of lost faith in the idea of technological progress um and lost faith frankly in the idea of economic progress and you know decided to become let's say I don't know much more you know cautious much more risk averse um much more you know sort of unwilling to to think of change as a as a positive and exciting thing um and and you know you actually see that I would say in in in in in America right now you know the relationship between industry and the government is is that a 50 year low it's it's you know think the actually quite quite a large amount of hostility between government and Industry and the same is certainly true in in in in Europe um and and so again you know our view is like look we you know we need technology we need technology we need Innovation we need markets we need these things to function why because we need growth um you know we we we want our societies to be grow societies we want people to think that there's opportunity we want people to be able to think in positive U uh some terms you know we we don't want people to think in terms of like for me to get something I have to take it away from somebody else we want to you know think about our society as as societies that can grow and flourish where our children will do better than we do um and so American dynamism is sort of a very direct investment program that we have um you know focused on injecting a lot more technological energy into a lot of the sectors of the economy that the governments are involved in um and certainly defense and intelligence are a big part of that but also energy and and and law and education and Healthcare are also big parts and in all these sectors you know frankly they they they just they I think they're really suffering from a lack of technological change and innovation and they could really use it what would be the key to get Europe to become more Dynamic I mean not that we no dynamic in Europe but uh compared to Silicon Valley we seem to be lagging a bit behind here yeah so look if you you know if you did a rank order of the the top 50 technology companies 30 years ago a large percentage of them were European I think it was about 40% um if you did a rank order today I think it's one out of 50 um and so you know Europe Europe has really falling off and and I guess the way I would describe it is it seems at least from the outside it seems to be almost entirely Choice uh which is it seems like it's been a choice to sort of prioritize regulation and risk aversion and the precautionary principle over U you know over Innovation you know the most acute version of that obviously is the energy sector um you know with a sort of sort of voluntary standown of energy development which you know I think has has led to you know real geopolitical stresses with respect to Russia um and so you know I I look I think I think it's been a choice I think that I think the the political leadership class in in in um in in Europe has decided that they they want this the the voters so far have supported them in wanting it um you know it has it has consequences I think the consequences are becoming clearer I think you know fundamentally it's a choice at a societal level and you know the the voters will either step up or they won't and the leaders will either step up or they won't but but but I think the the results of the current approach are in and I I don't I don't think they're they're very good any reflection any Reflections on your responsibility as a venture capitalist or Venture Capital investor at a time where technology is becoming so integrated into the race between the superpowers you know um ellon musk with with starling ly being key in Ukraine uh and so on what do you how do you think about it yeah so I would describe it as we're 100% on the side of the United States um and we're 100% on the side of the West um and so we know we never as a firm for example had an investment program in China we never we know we always viewed that there would be difficulties from that which you know for a long time you know looked like a mistake but I think is now you know increasingly clear so so we're 100% on the side of the US and the West um as a firm we don't have our own foreign policy We have basically the foreign policy of the US state department um and so we're you know we're sort of in complete lock step with our uh with our government you know we all of our programs that involve anything involving National Security will will will be based you know on on on the US government's view of of friends and allies you know I would say this you know this was a controversial position basically up until Russia's invasion of Ukraine um and so up until Russia's invasion of Ukraine basically there was a prevailing ethos in Silicon Valley that National Security is somehow bad or undesirable or the tech companies should not want to you know be involved in it and there was this famous incident where Google had this program with the US Department of Defense that their you know their employees basically rioted on campus and forced them to cancel um at the same time that Google actually had you know an AI lab in Beijing that by definition is you know anything in in in in China sort of connected to their Security State um and so you know there was a fair amount of I would think internal descension division in in Silicon Valley in terms of what the right role is you know between the valley and the US government um basically what what we've observed is the the minute Russia invaded Ukraine it was you know was obviously a catastrophe for Ukraine and a terrible thing and I wish it hadn't happened but it it caused sort of an instant sort of re um I don't know like a depolarization of this issue uh certainly in the in the US and in the valley where all of a sudden people who historically had been very averse to Tech involvement in defense all of a sudden became very in favor of it um and you know the most Vivid example there was this company andrel that was a very politically controversial company you know our our new defense contractor uh you know building all these automated defense systems um it was a very controversial company in the valley basically right up to the day russan invad Ukraine and ever since everybody loves it um you know which the founder of that company points out you know there's some you know some some some irony to that because the company's doing the same things um uh but I you know I think the Russian invasion of Ukraine really highlighted for a lot of people including a lot of people on the political left in the US that actually National Security really matters and there are actually bad people in the world and there are you know going to be invasions and there going to be bad things that happen and the Western democracies need to be able to respond and need to be able to be state-of-the-art being able to cope with these situations and then of course the you know the attack in Israel you know is a is a sort of a second again a another terrible thing but a second kind of uh factor that has caused to say okay we we need to make sure that Western democracies are actually armed up yeah yeah Mark finishing off on a completely different T here uh in one minute how can we become better investors because that's the theme of the conference yeah so I think the question always I I think the question for sort of large institutional investing the question is you know deployment of large amounts of capital there just are not that many places in the world to get growth um and so you know the fundamental challenge every large scale investor I talk to deals with is you know most the capital that they invest uh you know just kind of by definition can't go into high growth sectors um just because there aren't that many high growth sectors they're actually you know quite quite hard to find um and so there are a basically a small number of places in the world that have growth there are a small number of people who are starting the kinds of companies and trying to build the kinds of industries that are going to be able to to deliver growth um and so you know hope you know generally speaking you know Western investors are quite supportive of this and so you know vure capital is quite well funded but um you know I think focusing in on the specifically the places and the people who are going to be able to generate growth and then quite frankly the other thing is um you know it's very helpful when these investors also weigh in more broadly than just with money uh and also weigh in with their influence and you know with their with their level of authority and their level of of you know persuasive capability and so forth in their societies uh you know the growth is something that we should be aspiring for and that is is actually good not just from an investment standpoint but from a societal standpoint fantastic well a big thanks for sharing your thoughts with us and uh you know all the best of luck going forward great thank you very much it's great to be with you guys [Applause] now before we um share next year's program with you I just want to say a big thank you for to everybody who's made this conference possible we've had a lot of people working behind the scenes so if you wouldn't mind just helping me giving them a bit of [Music] Applause and then next year conference is going to be um something very different from this year uh you may remember that we had uh the CEO of Ferrari on the podcast a little while back now he was very keen to come to Oslo uh to uh to cook he's very keen on his reindeer now um a lot of people want to join um uh the COO Ferrari when he comes to O law so we have um a preliminary lineup here in addition to Ferrari we have the CEO of uh Nova Nordisk which is now the largest uh company in uh Europe we have uh door Dash which is the biggest delivery company outside of uh America of outside China we have Odis um which I think in a way is exemplifying the importance of recurring revenue streams is an elevator company you know if you don't pay your maintenance there is just going to be no service uh we have Nestle in terms of pricing power talking about the importance and how you build Brands and how you do that we have Adidas BJ gulen um coming to talk about Brands and then um lastly I mean we um elen musk has
