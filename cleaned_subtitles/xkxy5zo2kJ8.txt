after World War II our occupations of Japan and Germany were very successful in rooting out the toxic ideologies and completely transforming the society and culture whereas you know Afghanistan Iraq we didn't have the same effect what explains why uh those occupations were so much more successful easy one is a case of rebuilding institutions and the other one is building them from scratch you can rebuild things rapidly and if you think of after the war how things were bombed out and when Western Europe and quite rapidly they repair buildings and things so both Germany and Japan had had an extensive uh list of functioning institutions from local police officers offices to Educational Systems to governments that uh local provincial Etc governments and running the train systems and businesses and all of this have been absolutely functional and so finding the expertise to uh create that is is easy and of course Germans and Japan Japanese be living there so they are very interested in rebuilding and then what the key thing the United States then did for I know more about Japan than Germany is um we uh the Japanese were Heming and hawing over their what their constitution was going to be like and so MacArthur finally got fed up and in one week he got his staff to write this Constitution and they're running around Tokyo going to bombed out libraries or whatever trying to find examples of Western con uh constitutions so they can pull it all together as long before there's an internet where you can figure these things out and they're figuring out what the Constitution is going to be and so he just they cook it up over the week and what the the Japanese think the ones we're dealing with and they think well you know the Americans are going to leave and so we'll we'll go along with this constitution but once the Americans are out we're going to do whatever and what prime minister Yoshida he was the first uh postwar prime minister he said well we thought we could change it back but he realized uh because of the vote universal suffrage allowing women to vote and there had been a certain amount of land reform uh he said there was no going back it permanently changed the balance of power in in Japan and another feature is the Japanese the Imperial Japanese Army had so disgraced itself uh their strategy had led to the firebombing of the home Islands talk about a total fail so and in Germany um the same sort of thing you have Universal elections and things and in the it took a while to get this the Western zones United because uh all the fighting with the Russians over their Zone you eventually get two Germany Etc but um then you have a very competent postwar generation both in Japan and Germany who understood full all the horrors of the war that they've been put through as conscripts and and they are really intent on rebuilding their societies and they're the miracle Generations in both countries there's no parallel for that in uh Afghanistan and Iraq right they they've never uh had they've never been developed countries Germany and Japan were developed countries so and then you think well how long does it take to become a developed country well some people say centuries right and then there's a whole other piece which is the Germans and Japanese had a real sense of nation right nationalism so you don't have to worry about nation building because they have a sense of national identity you do worry about State Building so we're doing helping with State rebuilding well in Afghanistan and um Iraq there's no sense of a Nation they have these uh I'm no expert on these parts of the world but my understanding is you have these very different ethnic groups many who want to kill each other right you just got a a civil war going on there talking about a death ground kind of Civil War where one's in power and just ruins the other other gets in power they ruin the other people and that's what's going on in Afghanistan and Iraq in addition because they internal locations right they're in the middle of Contin continents and they're surrounded by a variety of neighbors and if you look at those neighbors you go oh a bunch of those people are going to intervene and they're going to intervene in very dist stabilizing ways um very difficult in Japan it's an island it's hard for people to intervene uh Germany we put a lot of money into it uh with having troops and getting the German Army and other things up and running and this will be Ukraine's future where they will uh be have well they already apparently do have the finest Army in Europe and then they're going to make it highly defensible before the before it's all over and Europeans uh as a group understand that it is absolutely in their in uh interest to have an impregnable border around Ukraine it protects them all and Europe doesn't threaten Russia they would love it if Russia would join the party join the rules Spas order you'll make money you'll do well except uh the oligarchs in question this real minority of people who run Russia and Putin they personally won't do as well well now they're war criminals so they're out of luck
