>> Last month, US automaker
Stellantis announced it would
be making a big move.
Literally.
The company intends to shift
production of a Jeep model from
Brampton to Illinois.
About 3000 workers were employed
at the Brampton plant before
it shut down last year to get
ready for the Jeep Compass.
Ottawa is not pleased, to put
it mildly, and it's now
launching a formal dispute
resolution process.
First up on the show, what are
the government's chances here?
What will this mean for
Ontario's workers and for the
province's auto sector?
Then cars are big business.
They're also show business.
They've powered the success of
Universal's biggest
franchise, "The Fast and the
Furious."
How did a film many assumed
would be a clunker drive,
the creation of a fleet
of sequels that have racked up
more than $7 billion and
changed the movie business
along the way?
Welcome to "The Rundown."
The federal government is
challenging Stellantis decision
to shift production of
the Jeep Compass down south.
Is it time for Canada to look
beyond the Big Three automakers?
Should we embrace China's
ascendant auto industry instead?
I asked Greig Mordue, associate
professor in the W. Booth
School of Engineering Practice
and Technology at McMaster
University and former general
manager at Toyota motor
Manufacturing Canada.
Greg, welcome to the program.
How are you doing today?
>> Good. Glad to be here.
>> I want to start with Ottawa
and Stellantis.
Ottawa is launching a dispute
resolution process against
Stellantis for moving a planned
vehicle production from Brampton
to the US.
Does this have any teeth?
Does does this move anything
substantial to hold them
accountable?
>> Well, every one of those
agreements are different, and
I'm sure that Stellantis signed
agreements for their for their
work in Windsor and their
extension of what we're talking
specifically about in Brampton,
as well as their joint venture
with LG to to build batteries
in Windsor.
So all of those will be
different.
They may have some connections
between the two of them.
I don't know the details
of that.
They haven't shared them.
They it's considered
proprietary,
but I've looked at those in the
past and they typically are
they they are funded in such a
way that if you know, there's
an agreement, you're going to
bring this technology, you're
going to build this product.
And if you meet your
requirements and you spend the
money, the Government of Canada
and the province of Ontario
will send the funds in kind.
And when and if you don't do
that, you'll have some kind of
a discussion about what to do
going forward or change plans.
Change and plans do change as
they go through.
The issue is at this point,
from what I understand,
insofar as the Brampton
is concerned, is that
they funded $110 million.
Sounds like a lot.
It's more than walking around
change.
But if, frankly, if Stellantis
comes through this and someone
says for you to get out of
Brampton, it's going to cost
you $110 million.
I think they'll probably say
we're out of there.
So you got to be careful
what you ask for.
Having said that, I don't think
it's a terrible thing, frankly,
for the government of Canada
to put the put pressure on
Stellantis.
I mean, the first and perhaps
most satisfying aspect of that
is it holds their feet
to the fire.
But by holding their feet
to the fire, frankly,
it it may cause them to say,
listen, we don't have
anything for Brampton.
Admit that they don't have
anything for Brampton.
And frankly, they'll be doing
those employees, their existing
employees that are hanging on
with those $45 an hour jobs,
or the promise of the hope of
those $45 an hour jobs, they'll
be able to cut their ties and
get and, frankly, get on with
their lives.
And and the sooner they can
do that, it'll be tough.
It's difficult for everyone.
Frankly, it's easy for me
to sit here and and make
that pronouncement, but it
allows them to do to go forward
because nobody in Brampton
wants to hire anybody that
makes $45 an hour because they
know, understandably, that
they're gone the very next day
when they get called back.
So it's a it's a it's a tough
pill, but in, in in but perhaps
it's a positive attribute of
what the industry minister has
added to the conversation.
>> Well, speaking of tough
pills to swallow.
Is there a conversation
right now that we should be
having about how much faith
we should Canadians should have
in the big three US automakers
right now?
>> Well, it's common to say
that in the year 2000, which or
1999, which was the the high
water mark for the Canadian
auto industry, we made 3
million vehicles in this
country.
The vast majority of those
were made by the D3.
Last year we made 1.3 million
vehicles in Canada.
The big the big manufacturers
were Toyota at number one.
And number two was was Honda.
They were responsible.
Excuse me for about
three-quarters of the production
in this country.
So we've had a steady diet of
promises and pronouncements by
the D3 and, and corresponding
with that is a steady decline
in their production. Frankly.
You know, Stellantis is still
hanging in there in Windsor.
That's basically their foot,
their manufacturing footprint.
And that's the largest D3
manufacturing outlet in Canada.
But General Motors has gone
from well over a million,
including a million in
production in Oshawa in the
early parts of this century, to
a rump of about 100,000 today.
They they used to be the
largest automaker in Canada.
Now they're the fourth largest.
Frankly, they'd be the fifth
largest.
In other words, the smallest.
If it weren't for the fact that
Ford isn't making anything
right now.
>> I want us to stay on this
page.
I'm hoping you can give us
a bit of a history lesson here.
This isn't the first time
that Canada's auto industry
has faced challenges.
Take us back to the '50s
and '60s and how that
how we've sort of come through
that and what we can learn
from theirs.
>> So there are a lot of good
lessons to be learned from the
industrial policy measures that
the governments of Canada,
primarily alongside the
government of Ontario, have
have taken us back in the late
'50s, early '60s there, the
industry was starting to suffer.
It had we had 17.5, I believe,
percent tariffs on vehicles
coming in from from the US,
which essentially made for an
environment where if you wanted
to sell a car in Canada, you
had to make that car in Canada.
So Canadians were
understandably a little,
a little flummoxed because
they were paying more for
essentially the same vehicles.
Because when you can't achieve
economies of scale, you can't
you can't offer products
at a competitive price.
Meanwhile, we had the
devaluation of of of currencies
in Europe at that time, and we
had a had a influx of European
vehicles.
And then and then the economy
was suffering.
And so all that meant was that
the that employment started to
crater in the Canadian auto
industry.
So there was pressure placed
upon the industry.
So what Canada did was what
Canada does is set up a royal
commission and kick it down the
road a little bit.
And Vincent Bladen, I'm going to
tell you lots of stories.
Vincent Bladen was appointed the
the royal commissioner
and he heard lots of
interesting things,
including the a presentation
from United Auto Workers of
Canada that we should have
a Canadian-owned automobile
company which which will
probably resonate in local times
and current times as well.
But ultimately from out of all
of that came something called
the Auto Pact in 1965.
And the way it was implemented
is you needed to to make a
vehicle in Canada for everyone
you sold didn't need to be
the vehicle.
But if you if you were a
company selling 100,000
vehicles a year in Canada, you
had to commit to make 100,000
vehicles a year in Canada and
to make sure that you weren't
just bringing in vehicles from
the US, for example, and
putting some hubcaps on them,
for example, and saying, there
we made it, here it we had a
60% Canadian value added for
every for, for the vehicles.
>> In your research, you have
probably seen that China looks
like a very attractive partner
for Canada in the auto industry.
Tell us why we may, should or
why we should be looking in
that direction.
>> Well, if you look at it
purely from the perspective of
of automotive industrial policy,
there's no question China is
the is the is the avenue we
should pursue.
And there will be
all kinds of people that
disagree with me about that.
And we need but we need to have
that debate.
I understand that China is
difficult for lots of
other reasons as well,
and we don't need to,
and I won't get into those.
But China, if we follow
the lessons that you and I
have gone through between
attaching ourselves to
the strongest or ascendant auto
makers first in the '60s with
the US, second in the '80s with
Japan, and now clearly the
ascendant auto maker,
particularly as we move into
the electrification of mobility.
We're not moving as quickly in
in North America as the rest of
the world.
But if we move in that
direction, China is clearly
the leader.
My own research, for example,
shows that China generates
automotive patents and have had
and have for the past decade
at a rate of about 5 to 1
over the US.
So you can get away with, with,
with not innovating for to the
same degree as your competitors
for a while and and be okay.
But over the long term, there's
nothing about the US auto
industry that suggests that it
is going to be a global leader
going forward.
And there's nothing about the US
industrial policy measures
or the energy policy measures
that suggest that the that
tethering continuing to try to
tether our industry to the US
industry is the best bet.
So I know China is challenging
for lots of different reasons,
but if we're looking at it pure,
from where do we want to be in?
So do we want an auto industry
in Canada?
We need to have that
conversation.
>> Greg, we are going to leave
it there.
Really appreciate your insights
and we appreciate
the history lesson as well.
>> Thank you.
>> How did a scrappy movie
about street racers give rise
to one of the most popular
franchises ever?
"The Rundown" producer
Colin Ellis talked to
journalist and author Barry
Hertz about his book "Welcome To
the Family: The Explosive Story
Behind Fast and Furious, the
Blockbusters that Supercharged
the World" about how the series
made Hollywood change gears.
>> Barry Hertz.
Welcome to "The Rundown."
>> Thank you for having me.
>> When did you become
interested in "The Fast and the
Furious"?
>> I think the first flicker
of interest was when I was a
teenage movie theatre worker
back in 2001.
Over the course of that summer,
I probably saw the first one
1520 times cumulatively in
little chunks stitched together.
And I just really kind of
dug it.
I was always a big tent kind of
moviegoer.
Even as a kid, I like
blockbusters, I like arthouse,
I like foreign language,
I like indie.
And something about, you know,
fast cars, cool guys, hot women,
heists, it all kind of clicked,
and I just kind of kept going
with the series.
>> So why did you want to write
a book about it?
>> Well, I was thinking I
always wanted to kind of write
some kind of book about the
film industry being eventually
becoming a critic and a writer
and a journalist, and I was
struggling to think it was like
all the kind of movies the big
movies had books about, you
know, you can find a million
books about "The Godfather," a
million books about Spielberg.
But then I started thinking I
was like, well, you know what?
No one's ever written about
"Fast" before.
And the more I thought about it,
the more I realised there's
quite an interesting arc to it.
It's not only how the series
evolved itself from this, like
little piddly street racing
movie with threesome jokes
until, like, this world
conquering, spy action filled
blockbuster.
But the off screen drama
of it all was fascinating too.
>> Who actually authored
"The Fast and the Furious"?
>> Well, I feel like with any
success, you find there's like
a million different authors who
want to take credit for it.
I mean, it all starts with
a very forgotten piece of
intellectual property,
which is a 1998 Vibe
Magazine article by a New York
writer called Kenneth Lee.
And Ken Lee was a tabloid
journalist at the time, writing
about crime in the city, and he
happened upon this subculture
of street racers out in Queens,
basically, and he wrote an
article about it for Vibe,
and that article made its way
to Universal executives who
optioned it.
And then you get really tricky
in terms of what
the screenwriter credits are,
because it's that idea.
And pitch went through upwards
of dozens of people.
>> How important is "The Fast
and the Furious" franchise to,
say, the last 20-plus years of
Hollywood?
>> I think if you were really
to think about it deeply, it
will be a quarter century old
next year, which is kind of
remarkable and preposterous at
the same time.
Really do mirror the past
25 years of Hollywood
in general.
We've seen filmmakers
increasingly rely on these
kind of connected cinematic
universes, where one film
leads to another and
characters from a different
kind of almost timeline pop in
so that it boosts audience
interest and makes you tag
along for the adventure.
I mean, "Fast" was really
at the forefront of that.
We've seen a lot of efforts to
reach wider, more diverse
audiences, and fast was doing
that organically, naturally,
before even the word diverse
was kind of like a studio
watchword.
And we've seen a lot of
expansion into international
markets.
You know, a lot of appealing
to the Chinese market,
appealing to South America,
making sure that these films
get more money outside of
the North American circuit
that they were typically
locked into.
And "Fast" was doing that
before really anybody.
>> When you watch the movie,
they are incredibly diverse.
Was that was that by accident
or was that by design?
>> It kind of depends on who
you talk to.
When you get into the origins
of the first film, I feel
most people are of the mind
that it was by Happy Design.
They were talking about
they were trying to recreate
this subculture in which, you
know, the writer David Ayer and
the director, Rob Cohen did
some heavy research into into
Southern California, and they
found that it was very much
Latinos.
It was Asian kids, it was
black kids, it was mixed kids.
It was everybody was kind of
it didn't matter the colour
of your skin so much as the
size of your engine.
And so they cast that first film
very deliberately to reflect
that culture and to try to stay
as authentic as they could.
And then as the films got
bigger, it wasn't necessarily
so much about appealing to
crassly targeting different
demographics as more so like,
okay, here's the people we have
and here's who we think work
well together on screen, and
let's just build up this kind
of United Colours of Benetton
super team that happened to
just, you know, naturally
appeal to different
marketplaces.
>> I think you've said and said
in the book that the films have
mostly stayed clean of some of
the toxicity that other movie
franchises like Star Wars or DC
seem to have.
What did you mean by that?
>> I feel like the online
fandoms, particularly over the
past five, six years or so,
when you have like a beloved
property like Star Wars that
engenders such rabid passion,
when you switch things up a
little bit to maybe be a little
more diverse, a little bit more
contemporary, a little bit more
progressive, you engender you,
you really engender a lot of
toxicity among a certain
community that can feel so
attached to, attached to a
property.
So when you know the Star Wars
stuff, did Rey as a
as a female Jedi, that was
apparently the worst thing in
the world you could possibly do.
But the "Fast" fans, because
it's kind of baked-in with like
that more diverse community
everybody can join so long as
you can drive that.
It was never really a problem
necessarily.
They just wanted to see
the franchise grow and expand.
And for that family.
And again, family is such a key
element of these films in that
both the organic family and the
found family, that everybody
was welcome.
It was a big kind of open
family party.
And if you could drive,
you can come along.
>> But unlike other film series
like the "Lord of the Rings" or
"Harry Potter," there's not like
a law, right?
Like there's no mythology
for these movies to really
draw from.
So I've always wondered, like,
how do they keep coming up with
stories?
I mean, if they're just
basically street racing
and heists.
>> I mean, that's the that's
the great thing, though.
They're not beholden to any
kind of mythology or lore.
There's there's not like this
Star Wars universe you have to
abide by in terms of timelines,
like the Battle of Yavin is
there.
So they can't be doing that
at that time, right? Yeah.
There's really all you want to
do is see these guys drive and
pull off these crazy stunts.
So a lot of the films
really are.
They construct these big set
pieces first, and then they
kind of reverse engineer the
story around it.
And for the fifth film,
which is where the franchise
really kind of levelled up,
they recognised that, okay,
the first for a lot of
street racing in there,
there's only so much we can do
from having a guy drive from
point A to point B faster than
the other.
So let's up the ante.
Let's turn it into a heist film.
Let's make these guys actually
have a mission.
An impossible mission,
one might say,
in the Ethan Hunt mould.
And that's really where they
kind of started levelling up.
>> I want to ask you about
women in these movies, notably,
Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana
Brewster have been from the
very beginning.
Later you get Charlize Theron
and my favourite, Helen Mirren.
Oh of course, yeah, but they're
not necessarily at the centre at
the of these films the way that
the men have.
And I'm just wondering if you
think the "Fast and Furious"
movies has done a disservice
to its female characters
and by extension, their fans?
>> I mean, 100%, certainly.
And I think this was something
that Michelle Rodriguez, who was
very vocal about anything and
everything in the press, has
publicly taken the franchise to
task over.
And there was at one point,
I believe it was between
film seven and eight where she
went out there and said, like,
listen, if you're not going to
start giving us more to do and
adding more women to the
picture who are not just, you
know, romantic objects, I'm out.
And to their credit, they did
start to work in a little bit
more and give especially the
characters played by Jordana
and Michelle, a little bit more
dialogue between them and
interactions that didn't just
involve talking about the men
in their lives, but it is a it
is a big problem.
It has been since the beginning,
but it was going to be even
worse if Michelle hadn't spoken
up during the production of the
first film and said, like, well,
I'm really just being
characterised here as this sex
object, give me something to
sink my teeth into a little bit.
And as light as it was in the
final film, it could have been
much worse.
>> Well, let's talk about more
about the stars, because
obviously these movies kind of
rest on the shoulders of
Vin Diesel.
How did he come to be cast?
>> It's kind of an interesting
story.
Originally, the studio
Universal had their eyes on
Timothy Olyphant, who they were
very hot on at the time, coming
off of Doug Liman's "Go!"
He also had the very similarly
themed "Gone In 60 Seconds"
coming out a little bit later.
Kind of a interesting choice,
let's say.
And I'm a big Timothy Olyphant
fan.
>> Yeah. Me too.
>> But they needed somebody
who was a little bit
more mysterious, had a little
bit more allure to him.
And along comes Vin Diesel.
But he also had something of a
problematic reputation around
the industry at the time of the
first film, butted heads with
directors.
Had a little bit of an ego
problem.
And I mean, we're talking about
a guy who had not led a film.
Like he was supporting roles
at best.
Like he got a big break with
"Saving Private Ryan."
He was just had finished
"Pitch Black," which was,
I guess you could call it,
his first lead role, but a
relatively small movie.
And yet there was something
about him, the magnetism,
and especially one that bounced
off the energy of Paul Walker,
who was cast first,
and who this was really
the person who the vehicle
was built around.
It was never intended as
a Vin Diesel star project.
Paul was there from day one.
>> I mentioned Paul Walker, and
one of the tragedies of this
series is that he passed in the
middle of making "Furious 7."
How did they finish the movie
without him?
>> I mean, that was kind of a
horrible and unprecedented
situation for the industry at
large.
Not only was there just
the tragedy of losing him so
young, there was the horrible
irony of it happening in a car
crash in a movie about car
crashes. Right?
So when that happened
and it was around Thanksgiving
break, they were about halfway
through finishing "Furious 7"
and there was still
a lot of scenes that he
needed to shoot, so they had to
make a decision.
Are we going to scrap the movie?
Are we going to try to
recreate it?
Or how are we going to do this?
So a lot of very smart people
came together, figured out
they could do it with a mix of
practical and visual effects.
Will get his two younger
brothers onto the set, Caleb
and Cody.
One was a good match for
his face, one was a better
match for his body.
Kind of smushed them together.
We'll have another actor
who was also kind of
a good fit for Paul.
Kind of helped them adjust to
the acting styles.
We're going to take every single
archival minute or second
of Paul Walker that's ever
been captured on film,
and we're going to take that,
and we're going to extract
all that footage
and digitally manipulate it.
And that's kind of what
they did.
They kind of, for lack of a
better term, zombified Paul
Walker as a being cinematically
and finish the film.
>> Did this sort of set
Hollywood on a path of
digitally resurrecting actors
in some way, because, I mean,
we've seen this with with the
Star Wars movies.
Carrie Fisher obviously died
before "Rise of Skywalker"
came out.
Ian Holm was resurrected
for "Alien: Romulus."
Is "Fast"-- Could they be
given credit for also starting
Hollywood on this path, too?
>> I mean, to the degree that
they were doing it, yes, it had
been done before in very
limited fashion, but they were
really inventing technology and
practices on the fly as they
were doing this.
And, you know, one of
the people I spoke to
for the book, who was very
heavily involved in the visual
effects there, you know,
of course, didn't think
that they were, you know,
at the forefront of this
AI deep fake train.
But they were and that's
where we are today.
And that's why you have
some troubling, you know,
emotions in the fan community
when someone like Vin Diesel
goes out to a crowd and says,
for the next one, I'm
we're bringing back Brian
O'Conner, we're bringing back
Paul Walker's character. Okay.
How are you doing that?
Probably in a way that is going
to be disturbing to a lot of
people.
>> Well, we haven't seen
a "Fast" movie since 2023.
Fast.
What's the status of the series?
>> It's not great.
Partially it's been in a kind of
deep freeze because they've
been trying to figure out
the economics of it.
These movies have become
so expensive to make
because the cast demands
so much money.
By this point they shoot it in
dozens of locations
around the world.
The stunt work, the effects
work, it all adds up.
And that's before you even
get to marketing costs.
And the math just isn't
mathing, as the kids
So it's been on a little bit
of a freeze for that.
And also because Vin Diesel is
facing a civil lawsuit
for sexual assaults,
which has been kind of
underreported.
It was, you know, he has
contested all those allegations.
It has not been tested in court.
It will go to courts in
February of 2026, I imagine.
And the people that I have
talked with have, have said
this, that once that is
resolved, one way or the other,
we will have a better idea of
what the future of "The Fast and
the Furious" is.
>> Creatively, though, has
the franchise run out of gas?
>> I think you could probably
have used that argument after
each one of the films has come
out.
Like, okay, we've kind of
hit the peak here.
There's nowhere to go.
And yet they always kind of
seem to find a way
to surprise you.
So I think the way to go
and the sentiment inside
Universal seems to be
this way as well, is we can't
really go bigger.
We've gone as big
as we possibly can.
We've gone to outer space.
We're not going to necessarily
introduce some fantastical
element like time travel.
Maybe.
So we got to take it back to
the streets a little bit,
do a little bit more hard
scrabble, a little bit
more grit.
I do not think that creatively
it's exhausted itself.
I think it will always,
at least for the time being,
find ways to surprise us.
