you live within the castle walls of this Maritime order that people follow the rules and then you're protected on the outside we have military things Etc if those walls are breached by dictatorship or by really stupid Grand strategy like our country's come perilously close in the last few years perilously close if Trump had been president at the time uh Ukraine was invaded Ukraine would be no more we would have Russian armies right up to the Polish border now I gave the Marshall lecture was published in the Journal of military history and in it I summarized my views on what the difference between a continental and Maritime power and that's one of my big career takeaways it's a fundamentally different way of looking at the world so Putin honestly looks at the world that if I control territory that's what makes me secure Maritime Powers they start with Britain which is hey M secure if I can maximize money from Commerce because then I can buy navy and buy allies with armies and stuff and then eventually this order of of organizing trade by international law and the Dutch Republic is instrumental in this with Hugo grodus who is the founding father of international law they want to run transactions by law Etc this is um an international order that's win-win you join it you get security um you have input on how it evolves because it's a work in progress whereas this Continental thing is negative sum and you can see it in Ukraine so Putin wants more territory okay he's got a zone right he took the eastern Ukraine and he uh took Crimea in 2014 but it's negative sum because he destroys whatever businesses had been being run in in dbass and he absolutely kills the T most of the tourist industry if you look at Europe as a peninsula uh you're better off with more insulation from Russia than not and Europeans uh as a group understand that it is absolutely in their interest to have an impregnable border around Ukraine it protects them all and isn't it fascinating that the fins and the swedes who forever were neutral are now all over this Europe doesn't threaten Russia they would love it if Russia would join the party join the rules Bas order you'll make money you'll do well except uh the oligarchs in question this real minority of people who run Russia and Putin they personally won't do as well um they could join the maritime order any day that is what um at the end of the Cold War everyone wanted them to do everyone wanted Putin to join it the Russians if you think about all the money Putin has spent on his crazy military stuff imagine what would have happened if he'd spent all that on the Russian Road system because their Road system's deplorable and imagine if he had devoted his attention to trying to uh have have a better legal system so people could start small businesses get bigger without having someone then come in on them for protection money think where Russia would be now it would be dramatically better they have so much energy so many raw resources oh they have so many talented people but Russians don't see it that way they see it in this Continental View and they're the ones who have to come to terms with what they think in the meantime this is why containment is brilliant is in the meantime those of us who join the maritime order need to work with each other and then we contain the problem by saying you cannot join us on equal footing till you behave yourselves you get a timeout right if you if you you get a timeout from the global order but we would welcome you back in so you're talking about people doing territorial conquests right and taking things you're butchering a lot of people you're destroying wealth in an incredibly rapid clip you can do that but it's really wealth destroying since the Industrial Revolution in the west uh there has been a growing consensus that that's probably not the way to do things we are far better uh crafting International institutions International laws treaties that we sign on to the parts that we want to and then we adhere to them and then that allows us to go all over the world running our little credit card transactions no one kills us and uh you can make a lot of wealth right doing that and that was the conclude that if you look at uh since the Industrial Revolution who's making all the money people who buy into that system and uh the Hitler uh territorial expansion is in a way it's a real throwback to a pre-industrial revolution way of managing your National Security this is how traditional Continental Empires always did it the Industrial Revolution with economic growth compounding economic growth offers a completely different alternative which says we're going to do compounding wealth by having rules that we can all adhere to and then we'll run our commercial transactions that way institutions are really important institutions structure decision making now it's very difficult to figure out what types of Institutions to build and uh when you see failings in them you go I got to do something next time but this again is the Brilliance of this evolving Maritime order in which we live where people sign on on to the things in which it's in their interest to sign on to them like you sign on to treaties and then you have provisors of the parts you don't want and you join these International organizations and then you influence how they develop Etc so these organizations have been instrumental the ones built right after World War II in holding to peace that that's my biggest career takeaway is that um if we go through international law and international institutions and this is not a hge political scientists love to talk about ah America the hegemon right no other country in the world wants an American hedgemon there may be some people in the United States who thinks that looks great but no one's going to buy on uh buy into a world order in which the United States is the hegemon who pushes everyone else around I get it we're big and we're influential other people influential too uh but this Maritime order where yeah we're an important part of it but have many other people in it it's a win-win and you can look it's um with Biden right now he's doing all of these meetings with Europeans of managing of what's going to go on in um Ukraine Etc and it's based on agreement of all these different countries chipping in big and small those countries that are willing to cooperate with each other not invade negotiate um their disagreement work through International organizations improve International organizations that world is what you want to protect and you want um to allow people to come and join so if Russia changes its mind uh new government Etc you want to bring them back into just the way um Japan and Germany were brought back in uh you want to protect that order forever our our prosperity is based on it
