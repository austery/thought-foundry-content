One consistent pattern at the top
of almost every equity bull
market in the past has been tightening
fed policy instead of easing policy
that we have today.
And then, of course, this is a very small
and maybe silly example.
But a couple of years ago, I remember when
the GLP one drugs were being rolled out,
there was a very brief window
where investors were talking about buying
the airline stocks on the basis
that fuel costs would be lower.
Right. Yeah.
When this narrative,
this type of narrative starts
to emerge in my conversations,
that's the kind of time
where I think you will be seeing prices
run ahead of earnings, which, as I
mentioned, is really not been the case.
I'll be a lot more nervous
that that's interesting.
So when you just start to see investors
start to justify things on various
banks shots, I trust the narrative.
Yeah.
And that's that's just sort of like
it's like a behavioral sign
that maybe people are starting
to get over their skis a bit.
I think this has been
one of the least enthusiast markets.
That is often described as a bubble.
In recent history.
Hello, and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Tracy Alloway and I'm Joe Weisenthal.
We always start these the same with
someone saying it's that time of year.
It's the most wonderful time of the year.
That's right.
Never, never change 2026 forecast season.
It's the outlook season
and it is the moment when every investment
bank, on Wall Street
releases their forecasts for next year.
Yeah, it is a great time.
You know, we make New Year's resolutions
this time of year.
We go back, we make our list of top
ten things that happen a prediction.
That's what you're supposed to.
It's a quiet time of the year.
Often news gets a little quiet,
often around the holidays.
So we make up for it
by just looking back and looking forward.
And then a year later,
we completely forget what everyone said
about the current year,
and we just move on and do the next year.
That's right. Always forward looking.
Although I do think, you know, 2026
shaping up
to be an interesting year
for a variety of reasons.
We just had a CPI number that came out
surprisingly softer
than a lot of people expected.
Some people say unrealistically softer
with 0% shelter costs increase.
So that was interesting.
We're going to have a new fed
chairman. Yeah.
There's still a question
mark over the impact of tariffs,
whether we're waiting to see
those show up. And,
what's going to happen with unemployment
as well, that's been ticking up.
And then it's been this really incredible
year, obviously in the stock market.
I and the US, stock market
just continues year after year after year,
with a few exceptions here and there,
but not many putting up massive numbers.
And so the question is like can we expect
how long is this realistic,
especially given,
you know, all the concerns
about concentration
and a handful of names,
some of which haven't
really been doing so well lately.
And so, yes, what
so many questions on both the real economy
and the stock market.
Yeah,
there's definitely been some dispersion
creeping into some of the big
AI names or the tech names.
All right.
Well, I'm happy to say we do, in fact,
have the perfect guests, plural.
We've got two.
So we're going to be speaking with 
Jan Hatzius He’s the Chief Economist
and head of
research at Goldman Sachs.
He's been on the show
a number of times before.
We like talking to him
at least once a year.
And Ben Snider, 
he is the chief U.S.
equity strategist
to replacing David Kostin.
So thank you both for coming on
Odd Lots.
Thanks so much for having us.
Great to be here.
Is research outlook time.
Is that actually a quiet time for you
guys?
It's not a quiet time.
Normally
we actually do it about six weeks earlier.
Yeah because actually
November tends to be a little bit
better than December.
But because of the shutdown and the dearth
of data, we decided to push it back.
It's completely under our control
when we do it.
And why do it at a time when you actually
have much less information
that makes it more so?
We pushed out, a number of reports
yesterday, including the Global Economic
and Markets Outlook.
Can you talk the two of you maybe again.
So obviously different roles,
but on the same team.
And obviously the stock market, the U.S.
equity
market is different from the economy.
And you can have years
where the economy is fine, stocks are bad
and vice versa, all different permutations
and combinations.
But how do you think about
being an alignment cross team.
And so that roughly,
you're sort of working
under a similar set of assumptions?
Yeah, I can talk about that.
And not just with respect to the U.S.
or global economic outlook
versus stock market outlook, but of course
there's currencies, there's
m economies, there's commodities.
Certainly on the macro side,
I would say we're
on the coordinated side of the spectrum.
We're not nobody is at one extreme
or the other extreme.
You can't have people that just work
alongside one
another
without ever talking to one another.
But you also shouldn't have just a machine
where everything is exactly aligned.
And there's zero room
for individual initiative.
So but we're towards the coordinator side
for sure.
Good time to note to, listeners,
we are recording this December 19th, 2025.
Ben, how do you think about sort of
working with,
you know, aligning your views
of where markets are going or what
the meaning of the rally has
with the sort of with the macro thinking?
There are a number of frameworks
to think about the equity market,
but a pretty common one,
and one we rely on a lot,
is to think of the market like a stock
as a discount stream of future cash flows.
And from that perspective,
the most important driver of stocks
is that stream of cash flows is earnings.
And if you break those apart, the most
important driver of those cash flows
is usually the US economy.
So we rely very heavily on John's
forecast.
So in terms of yarns forecast,
I notice you're forecasting
strong growth as in GDP
but also rising unemployment.
How do you square those two things.
We have flat unemployment at 4.5%.
But it's not going down
as you might think when you're printing
let's say 2.6% for real
GDP in 2020 26.
And a small part of the answer
is that that 2.6 probably overstates
the underlying trend a bit, because
we have the down that depressed Q4.
It's going to add to Q1,
but the more important
part of the answer is accelerate
ING productivity growth.
And we've seen that over the last
five years.
The five years
since the pandemic have shown
about 2% underlying trend.
Productivity growth.
The prior cycle was at about 1.5%.
And I think there's reason to believe
that that acceleration is still ongoing,
because it probably doesn't
have a lot of AI in it.
We expect more of a boost
from AI going forward
in the next five years
than in the last five years,
and I think that's got important
implications for the relationship between
GDP and unemployment.
So so obviously,
like the distribution of growth matters,
it seems to particular matter
when we're talking about the stock market,
because you can have sectors
that are like very quiet,
but then you have these gigantic companies
that make a ton of money and capture
a lot of the growth that their stocks
do incredibly well.
Maybe it would be helpful
even before we get to the 2026 outlook
for the economy, then,
like what happened in 2025,
what were the underlying conditions
that allowed for such
like another monster year?
Especially for the Nasdaq
and a lot of the big tech names.
So to bring it back to earnings, yeah,
one thing that happened
was really strong earnings growth.
And I think among all the discussions
of bubbles,
what's underappreciated is just how strong
corporate earnings growth has been.
Yeah. Just wrapped up
the third quarter season a few weeks ago.
And S&P 500 companies in aggregate
reported earnings growth of 12%.
Even if we strip out the mega caps,
the median S&P stock reported earnings
growth of about 10%.
That's very solid.
This is seems to be like
an underappreciated point, which is that
look.
Yeah,
AI driven market the tech heavy market.
It is not just that is it.
Take an extension for this.
We spend a lot of time understandably
talking
about the largest stocks in the market.
The top ten stocks
or over 40% of market cap.
We should spend a lot of time
talking about them.
But if you look at the S&P 500
or excuse me, S&P 490 or 493,
that market or that group of stocks
has returned about 15% this year.
They returned about 15% last year.
They returned about 15% the year prior.
And so I understand
why we're talking about the large stocks.
But really the broad US equity
market has performed quite well.
Well, how do you account for,
I guess, the weakness that we've seen in
some of the mega tech stocks
in recent weeks, what's going on there?
For three years we've been obsessed
with AI as a as a market.
And for three years, really,
the story has been
increased CapEx, extraordinarily growth
in AI investment spending.
And although we're discussing a lot
the eventual productivity benefits,
as Yann mentioned, really the trade in
the equity market has been the companies
with earnings that are benefiting
from those CapEx dollars.
And what's happened this year,
especially in the last several months, is
it's become increasingly clear that
a probably that growth will decelerate
next year and be to continue that growth,
it's going to require more debt.
And both of those factors have made
investors understandably uncomfortable.
Jan one of the sort of the sort
of the viral charts of the year
or various estimates of like,
how much the AI build out
specifically is a driver of U.S.
economic growth in 2025 and beyond.
Like how much like, you know,
when you look at the, yeah, GDP in 2025,
how much of the growth can you attribute
to what Ben just talked about?
Actually
pretty close to zero, really. This is
a different story.
I love to for two reasons.
Number one,
the goods that are being invested,
in the AI sector are largely imported.
So you can look at the contribution
of investment spending to GDP growth.
But if you don't net that out,
yeah, against the imports
then you're going to get the wrong answer.
That's that's one reason.
The second reason is that semiconductors,
semiconductors are generally treated
as intermediate inputs okay.
Not as investment.
So they don't actually show up in the in,
in the, in the investment numbers.
And so when we look at the impact
of AI investment on measured GDP growth,
the numbers
that are actually being presented,
we're getting only about 20 basis
points of contribution
over the last 3 or 4 years,
and pretty close
to zero over the last year.
It strikes me as such an important point,
because, you know, you have other people
estimating, oh, 50% of growth
this year is related to the AI buildout.
Are you just always like
banging your head against the wall?
Because you must see these headlines
every day like the rest of us?
I do a bit because it oftentimes is just
based on looking
at some portion of investment spending.
Sometimes there are also other things
included
in in those calculations
that aren't necessarily AI related.
But the the big point is that you really
need to look at the imports as well.
Then I should just ask
before we go any further, what actually
is your 2026 target for the S&P 500?
Because we haven't seen
the official outlook yet.
We've published 7676. Okay, okay.
So one thing I did want to ask
this was in Jan's, economic outlook.
But you talk about potentially credit
underperform ING,
which seems a little bit strange
if interest rates are going
lower and,
you know, equities are doing pretty good.
What's going on there?
I mean, it's mainly really the,
that the valuations are very high.
The credit fundamentals
we think are still, you know pretty good.
But the market is priced to
I mean not perfection perhaps,
but to a very close to our EO.
And so in that kind of situation
my instinct would always be to build
in a little bit of mean reversion.
And that would give you,
a modest amount of underperformance.
But I wouldn't say that that's a major
part of our,
our overall view for, for the next year.
I have a question.
And it's one of these things,
maybe it doesn't fit
right into this moment
in the conversation, but I'm so worried
that I'm going to forget it.
But I'm going to ask it now.
So we are recording this December 19th.
We got that CPI report yesterday, came in
2.6 on core,
this is year over year
because we didn't have October data.
And then there were people like, wait,
they imputed a 0% zero rent growth or zero
shelter inflation for October
when they didn't collect the data, etc..
And but then I'm like, okay,
that doesn't sound that doesn't sound
particularly accurate or that doesn't
sound like that sounds a little risky.
But on the other hand, we're talking about
a year over year number,
so I'm not really sure
why October really affects that.
Can you just before we go any further,
explain how I should understand
yesterday's CPI report?
Yeah, I mean, they use a six month,
you know, growth
rate for, for rents and they,
they did assume, zero
sequentially for October.
And that does take away from the year
on year
growth rate
as of the November number as well.
So we do think that shelter inflation
in yesterday's
numbers were was was understated.
And the numbers are not quite as good
as the eight basis points
for core CPI on average
for October and November.
So I would suggest so capturing
rent is not like measuring bananas,
where I could say here's
the price of a banana in November 2025.
Here's the price of a banana
in November of 2024.
Therefore,
you could just do a year over year thing.
You can't do that because they don't.
They don't do it that way.
They don't look at just one month, okay.
That and and it's also,
you know, is equivalent rent.
Well that's that's a separate point
that because this distortion affects
both actual rent and owners of cars.
Correct. Yeah. So it wasn't as good.
And they're probably also
were some other distortions stemming
from the fact that prices were collected
in the second half of November,
pretty close to Thanksgiving,
pretty close to the Black Friday deals
that may have understated,
okay, prices in the goods sector.
But I think if you step back
and look at the inflation
news more big picture,
it's pretty encouraging.
We've seen 2025,
meaningful
amount of pass through from tariffs.
We think about 50 basis
points of contribution to core PC
inflation.
Core PC inflation in that environment
has been going sideways.
So if you take out the 50 basis points,
if you think that that's
really a price level effect, that's
more like a value out of tax increase
and is going to come out of the numbers
in 2026,
then we've seen ongoing disinflation
to an underlying rate
that's no longer that far away from 2%.
And that's pretty good news.
Good.
Can we talk about prices and tariffs.
And I'm very curious
casting your mind back to April
this year, April 2nd, when
all the tariff announcements came out.
What was your base case
for the impact on inflation?
Because there seem to be
two schools of thought.
There are people who think companies
are going to use tariffs as an excuse
to raise their prices.
And then there are people who think
that tariffs end up being disinflationary
because they basically take money
out of consumer's pockets, like a tax.
We had
probably more
like 100 basis points of of pass through.
And we ended up I mean so far
I think with about 50 basis points.
And there's still a question
of how much of this reflects
just a smaller impact, greater absorption
maybe by the businesses sector.
And perhaps to a small degree
by foreign producers,
although I actually think that that number
is relatively small versus
just a different time
profile and a longer lag.
We don't know that yet, but it's probably
some combination of of the two.
The one thing that I think
has been consistent in terms
of how we think about it, is that
this is more of a price level effect,
and I've seen a lot of VAT increases
in European economies,
where VAT rates often move
usually upwards rather than downwards.
And we've got many precedents
that have shown,
you know, 12 month increase in inflation
on the back of one of these tax increases
and then a decline
when that when that gets cycled out.
Ben, let's talk about tariffs
on the stock market.
Because if the stock gains had just been
driven by a bunch of big tech companies,
we say, oh, of course
the tariffs didn't matter
because you know, there's
they're not as tariff sensitive, etc..
But when we're talking about the fact
that the S&P for 93 also did very well,
talk to us like it's not intuitive to me,
I would've guessed margins.
I would have guessed lower sales,
all kinds of things.
What did we
what did how did it all shake out for
from the equity perspective,
the impact of tariffs.
This is our concern to most of earnings.
Variability is driven
by margin variability.
When you have years with very large
earnings growth
or very poor earnings growth it's
usually because of margins.
Yeah.
And earlier this year we were concerned
that in part because of tariffs
margins would get squeezed
and that would weigh on earnings.
It wasn't just you who was concerned
and it really didn't materialize.
Now, I think that's part of what we have
to keep in mind is the counterfactual.
Right.
So for the last couple quarters, S&P 500
profit margins have basically been flat.
Well, in an environment of pretty healthy
nominal GDP growth, normally
you would expect some operating leverage
that would cause margins to expand.
And so I think part of the story here is
you didn't get that counterfactual.
But we've seen consistently
over the last few quarters companies
across earnings
calls really point to three
levers they've been pulling to offset
these pressures.
One is, of course, as John mentioned,
pushing through some in
the form of prices.
Second is both pushing back on suppliers
to absorb
some of the costs and restructuring
supply chains where necessary.
And the third is cutting costs,
improving efficiency within companies.
And that ties back to the slightly better
productivity story.
We've seen.
So we
talked about rising productivity early.
And you think that the the main boost from
it is yet to come.
Who actually captures
that productivity acceleration
when it comes to the equity market.
Like, you know, the big tech guys,
they have risen quite a lot.
And now we're seeing some of the non
tech companies start to catch up.
Who's going to benefit the most.
This is
I guess to call it
$1 trillion question is to understate
the value of this this question
I think the general consensus
certainly that we have
and that most of our clients have,
is that I eventually will create a very
large productivity boost to the economy
that will create value for someone
who that someone is, is hard to answer.
And as I mentioned earlier with the market
has been doing, given that uncertainty
over the last couple of years
is really focusing on near-term earnings.
It's been the semiconductors.
Obviously, it's been the hyperscalers
to some extent, power companies, etc.
I think that is actually one of the key
differences between this market
and what happened 25 years ago
during the dotcom bubble,
where we saw valuations
expand quite dramatically as investors
tried to look forward
and guess at the productivity gains
and the economic benefits.
Today, investors are saying we saw
what happened that time.
It's too hard.
And so what we're really going to focus on
is the earnings today.
This will be important.
So your view is that at least
from the behavior of public equity
investors,
you do not see any particular element of
people letting their imaginations run
wild.
Of course,
there are exceptions at the stock level.
And to some extent, if a stock trades hand
in hand with earnings
that are growing dramatically
because of a high CapEx investment,
the implicit assumption is the earnings
from that investment are sustained over
a long period of time.
So maybe one could argue,
actually the prices
should go up by less than earnings.
So I won't say there's no optimism
in the market
with valuations at the current level.
There's clearly optimism.
But it's a very different kind of optimism
from frankly what I expected
a few years ago, which is to trace
to your question, investors will be asking
who are the long term winners
and trying to pay for those immediately.
That is really not been the story.
I would actually say that's the key pivot.
That's happened in our conversations
with clients over the last few months,
which is as this anxiety has built up
about the AI infrastructure trade.
And as for the first time,
we've seen some public companies
discretely quantify the earnings
boost of AI.
The narrative has shifted from
how much will
the semiconductors and other
infrastructure companies make next year to
how can we identify long term
productivity winners?
What would make you nervous
when it comes to valuations in general?
This may be like indiscriminate investment
in anything that has the word AI in it.
That would do it.
Yeah, okay.
I think if you look historically,
you know, it's hard to quantify
speculative activity or over exuberance.
But we try and so a few months ago
we actually built something
we call a speculative activity
trade indicator.
It looks at trading volumes,
for example, in stocks with no profits,
trading volumes and stocks
with extraordinarily high valuation
multiples, as you might expect,
that is risen this year.
But it is comforting to me
that it is still well below
levels that we saw 25 years ago
and even five years ago.
In the 2021 experience.
Jan there's a question
I did not even really a 2026 question.
But, you know, one of the reasons
we've always loved talking to you is I
beyond just the forecast, etc.,
I consider you to be sort of a deep
macro thinker
with a rooted in academic ideas.
Economists seem, you know,
fairly strict on the idea that, like
tech, yes, new technologies
could put some people out of work,
but and that's obviously painful.
But in the aggregate,
tech doesn't destroy jobs.
Is there any reason
to think that I would be any different?
I mean, this is what scares people, right?
That there's going to be ten people
who have all the money,
and the rest of us are going to be living
on universal basic income.
I may very well be a good podcast host
at some time.
Like, and maybe podcasts will go away.
But like in the broad thinking,
is there any reason to think that somehow
this time it's different with
the relationship between tech and labor?
I mean, history
certainly doesn't support it
from the perspective
of the long term outcomes.
If you look at kind of intervals of,
you know, 1020 years,
you cannot find a
an adverse relationship
between more productivity growth,
even if it's more labor productivity
growth, that at the industry level
puts people out of work
and aggregate unemployment.
What you can find is increases
in frictional unemployment.
When you see, productivity acceleration,
it takes a while
for the new jobs
to be created in other industries.
The to compensate
for the jobs that are being lost
in, in the, in the affected industries.
And we do build in some of that
into into all forecasts.
And then it really becomes a question
of how quickly the other
the adoption really occurs.
If it happens over, say, a decade,
if you look at the entire economy and,
you know,
people think that's that's way too slow.
But I actually don't think it's a it's
a crazy idea
to think that this takes a while
to diffuse through the economy,
not just the most innovative companies,
but all companies and at all levels.
I do think it's
going to take a number of years.
That would probably give the economy time
to adapt and create jobs
in, in other areas.
But if it's if it's much faster,
then I'd be more worried
about short term increases
in frictional unemployment.
So it's important to keep an open mind,
even though I would say my underlying view
is on the optimistic side,
that we will be able to cope
with this structural change
the way that the US and world
economy has, has coped with
technological advancement in the past.
Can you talk a little bit about what's
been going on with consumer spending?
Because unemployment,
you know, getting a little bit softer,
but we haven't really seen a significant
hit to consumer spending.
And yet if you look at the sentiment
surveys,
everyone is miserable at the moment.
But they keep buying stuff.
What is going on there?
I think the sentiment surveys
have been getting less and less useful
for predicting activity and that's true
for the consumer sentiment surveys.
The University of Michigan in particular
has been quite far out of line
with what we've seen.
But it's actually true more broadly,
if you think back to,
you know, ten years ago or 20 years ago,
just the importance of the ISM
print for markets and the importance
now it's just nowhere close.
We still look at the business surveys
and the consumer surveys
because they have interesting detail.
They're very up to date,
but they just don't work as well as they
as they used to.
I certainly where, where I believe to.
So I would really focus more on the hard
data, the hard
data,
I would say that the consumers doing okay.
It's not the sort of consumer spending,
certainly not super rapid.
Maybe we'll get to,
you know, 2% or so next year, but I think
consumer spending in real terms
is likely to lag the overall economy.
There are obviously differences
between the top end.
I mean, the levels obviously,
but also the growth rates towards
the top end versus the bottom end.
That's a little bit
hard to really assess in real time,
because the official consumer spending,
the numbers are not broken down, right.
They're at a very high frequency
in the very up to date numbers.
But it it is a mixed picture up there.
But I would expect under our forecasts
for the economy, I would expect
the consumer to hang in there.
What would be your desert island
economic indicator for next year?
You're stuck on an island.
You can only look at one thing
to gauge the direction of.
It's always hard to beat the unemployment
rate.
Okay.
All right.
So on the unemployment rate
we should talk about the fed.
Right.
Because this time next year
we're going to have a new fed chair.
And almost like a year
of performance already.
When does he actually come in?
Like April or some May.
Okay.
Well, a significant amount of performance
in the role already.
How much of a change is a new fed chair
when it comes to your economic forecast?
I mean, it's
probably not a lot.
We're, you know, very unlikely to make,
make a forecast change
on the back of an appointment and,
I mean, I don't know who it's going to be.
It's a committee.
So there is more continuity
in the, in the system than I think
people sometimes believe when they talk
about the different potential candidates.
So at least in the, say,
six, 12, 18 month forward horizon,
I wouldn't really expect a major change
in terms of the policy outcomes.
Obviously,
the further out you go, the more room
there is for people to turn over
on the committee.
That's true
on the board of governors, it's true
among the Federal Reserve Bank presidents.
And that could have more of an impact.
But in the in the near term,
I would not expect
a massively different outcome
because there's a new chair, Ben.
And there's no talk to us about multiples.
And obviously you talking about
the importance of earnings, obviously.
And then how frequently
margin expansion is important.
But then there's also the multiples
question where are we now
in terms of how you think about multiples.
And then when you think where are we going
and how much is that going to be tied
sort of implicitly to perceptions of,
policy trajectory multiples high?
There's no debating that.
Certainly if you're comparing
with history, it's high.
In in the last few decades,
we've really only seen a higher multiple
very briefly during the post Covid
period, the reopening.
And of course, in the late 1990s, the
in that the the post Covid because no one
had made any money for like two quarters.
Well I think that's a key point,
which is one of the things that drives
the multiple higher
is expectations of accelerating
or improving earnings.
Yeah.
And from that perspective,
if I listen to John's forecasts
for a healthy economy that's improving,
it's not necessarily so strange to me
that the multiple is pretty elevated.
The only thing I would point out
is if we sat here a year ago, or frankly,
if we sat here at the beginning of 1999.
Weren't many podcast back then,
but we'll use our imagination.
The multiple was exactly where it is
today,
and that didn't really tell you anything
about what
to do with the market over the short term.
So I view valuations through a physics
lens as a measure of potential energy.
They tell you a lot
about how much the market can move
if there's a catalyst,
but they're not the catalysts themselves.
I know
you talked earlier
about how you're not seeing people,
invest in the AI productivity story
indiscriminately.
But when it comes to an expected
productivity boost
from this new technology,
what concrete evidence are you seeing that
this is actually happening versus,
you know, people talking their books?
Well, about 60% of S&P companies
say AI every quarter on their earnings.
True.
And you can probably count on one hand
how many are actually quantifying it.
So I don't think you should expect
to really see it in the numbers today.
Actually, for the first time,
we are modeling
an AI productivity boost in our S&P
500 earnings forecast for next year.
And the magnitude of that boost
is under half a percent.
So we still think even next year
it'll be quite small.
But the important thing is
it is growing over time.
But that's the uses of,
users of AI rather than the,
the investment.
Correct.
When you're spending hundreds
of billions of dollars
in CapEx, the AI boost
in terms of those dollars
has clearly been large
for the last couple of years.
So you're talking about the
the concentration of,
equities within the S&P 500,
very top heavy.
How does that compare
with the concentration of earnings
within the S&P 500?
That is a key point.
That is I think often underappreciated,
which is five years ago
the top ten stocks in the market
accounted for a third of market cap.
This was a record at the time.
Although we look back
and think it wasn't so bad.
And fast
forward now, they are a third of earnings.
So one way to conceptualize
this is the market was correctly
looking forward back then
and saying earnings are going to grow.
And so today
if the top ten companies are 40%
of market cap and a third of earnings,
the question is will
they continue to outperform on an earnings
basis over the next few years?
Well, given the current run
rate of earnings growth,
it looks very likely
that the answer will be
yes will outperform,
although on our forecasts
that gap will shrink a little bit.
And then markets might look forward
further than that.
And I mean that's been part of the issue
for some of them more recently.
And that's how you create valuation
problems.
Tracy, when I hear that big tech companies
only have about
a third of the earnings of the S&P 500,
my thought is, well,
that's 70% of all corporate earnings
that they have yet to swallow.
Let's think of all of these earnings
that are accruing to non-tech companies.
All of that is going to be Amazon's,
Amazon and Alphabet's income.
And there's there's still upside.
Yeah there's still 70%.
There's still the majority of money
is not being made by tech companies.
Okay, I got to ask though.
Yes, tech companies have seen,
you know, very dominant in recent years.
But what would it take
to make you a little bit nervous
about the outlook for next year?
The broad market outlook,
like what would you need to see to think
like, oh, wait a second,
we're kind of getting ahead of ourselves,
or I think maybe my target is a little
more optimistic than I had expected.
First, I think an investor
should always be a little nervous.
That's
a reflection of equity risk premium,
which is how the market generates
return over time,
or at least part of how the market
generates return over time.
Well, first, you know,
you mentioned his desert island indicator
being the unemployment rate for me.
Every Thursday morning
I wake up excited to see jobless claims.
This is I've said it many times.
I'm a claims guy
when it comes to my desert island.
We're on the same page, Ambrose.
So you know, if a few Thursdays in a row
we start to see
claims
rise, I'll become a lot more nervous.
If John walks down the hall one day
and says, you know, we think the fed
is going to hike at the next meeting,
I'll be nervous about that, too.
One consistent pattern at the top
of almost every equity bull
market in the past has been tightening
fed policy, instead of easing policy
that we have today.
And then, of course, the third is,
you know, this is a very small
and maybe silly example.
But a couple of years ago, I remember when
the GLP one drugs were being rolled out
there was a very brief window
where investors were talking about buying
the airline stocks on the basis
that fuel costs would be lower.
Right? Yeah.
When this narrative,
this type of narrative starts
to emerge in my conversations,
that's the kind of time
where I think you will be seeing prices
run ahead of earnings, which, as I
mentioned, is really not been the case.
I'll be a lot more nervous
that that's interesting.
So when you just start to see investors
start to justify things on various bank
shots, I trust the narrative.
Yeah.
And that's that's just sort of like
it's like a behavioral sign
that maybe people are starting
to get over their skis a bit.
I think this has been one of the least
enthusiastic markets
that is often described as a bubble.
In recent history.
Jan, what happened to housing?
And when I say that,
I mean, I feel that we could go
a whole conversation talking about
the economy these days without talk
about how mediocre
the housing market is doing,
whether we're talking about prices,
whether I would start
basically every measure of housing.
I'm not very good.
And yet, by and large, in conversation
about the economy,
you know, we used to there used to be
the housing cycle is the business cycle.
Even setting aside the crisis of 2008
2009, housing is linked to
the economy, has always for a long time
felt very robust.
Has that changed?
It's amazing
how if I look back to the well, certainly
run up to oh eight and the
the couple years after how we rolled,
I don't know, 30%, 40%, 50%
of what we were putting out on housing
and the spillovers from housing
and mortgage equity withdrawal
and leveraged losses because of mortgage
credit exposures on bank balance sheets
and how it is now such,
small part of the discussion,
because it's been kind of a tug of war,
I think, between, you know, on the one
hand, low vacancy rates
and therefore a supportive supply picture
for housing activity and house prices.
And at the same time, already high
price levels,
bad affordability
to so reasonably high mortgage rates.
And it just hasn't really moved very much.
Now, of course,
we've also seen demographic changes
that just result in less housing turnover.
But you know, it is not a major feature
of our outlook for 2026.
We have housing go,
you know, more or less sideways from here.
Low positive numbers for price
appreciation.
And and you know, I think the action
is really, really elsewhere.
More on the investment side.
And obviously a lot of the technical technology issues that we've been discussing.
We would be
remiss if we didn't talk about the world's
second biggest economy, which is China.
So in your outlook, it looks like you say
you expect China to hold up.
Well, and I think this would be surprising
to a lot of people
who look out at,
I guess, the global trading sphere.
And it looks like everyone is arrayed
against China in various ways.
The U.S has imposed tariffs.
Europe seems to want to do something,
and possibly, you know,
form a coherent bloc,
I guess, against China.
Why haven't we seen more of a growth hit
to China?
The manufacturing sector
and Chinese exports
have just held up incredibly
well despite a
at times punitive level of tariffs
from the US side.
You know, exports to the US came down
substantially in all 25, 30%,
on a year on year basis.
But exports to other places
have held up very well.
Overall, exports are still up 5 to 10%.
They're a little bit noisy
but very healthy growth rates.
And our expectation is that
that's that's going to continue
mainly because China keeps getting better
and better
at producing better and better goods,
a cheaper and cheaper prices.
And it's going to be pretty difficult
to really stem that for other economies.
And they also control
the supply of rare earths.
They can control about 70% of the mining,
90% of the refining.
That's a pretty good way
to deter, trade action and tariffs.
And I think we saw that
in the negotiations with the US. But
that could be relevant for other economies
that try to impose tariffs on China.
So I think the goods producing sector
is still going to be strong.
Now the flip side is that the domestic
economy is very weak.
And that's a that's a country where
the housing story is much more central.
Housing
starts and sales are still going down,
even though they're already down 60 to
80%, but they're still going down steeply.
Prices are still falling steeply.
Our China team estimates that
if you take the direct
and indirect effects of property on GDP
growth, it's subtracted
about two percentage points in 2025.
And while the worst is probably behind us,
they still have a one
and a half percentage point
drag next year.
So in that sort of environment,
we you know,
we think China will hold up okay.
You know, slower growth over time but
probably still closer to 5% then to 4%.
Then going back to US stocks,
I sort of joke that, you know, there's
70% of earnings out there that have yet
to be captured by big tech companies,
but actually kind of don't
really think that's a joke in the sense
that that does seem to be the trend.
There are a handful of companies
that are accruing a lot of value.
When you think about the earnings growth
that the big tech companies have,
the realized earnings growth,
and you gave the example about how,
you know, the market sort of was correct
five years ago
that they would come to represent
30% of earnings.
Is there any historical precedent
for the largest companies in the world
to be growing like this year after year?
Because I used to think mature companies
don't grow like small companies do.
Is this sort of like a novel phenomenon?
When you think about the history
of markets,
part of what's fun about markets
is they're always changing.
This seems to be one of those examples.
You know, we did a study last year.
We looked at 100 years of market
concentration in the US.
And at least over the last century,
we didn't find anything
that quite matches up to today.
Well, what do you think
would actually like put an end
to that market dominance, I guess
stronger antitrust laws or or what?
Yeah, I keep coming back to earnings.
And one way that earnings dominance
could end of course, is regulatory policy.
I think the the top of mind question
for investors is
whether this revolutionary shift
resulting from AI
technology is going to change
where the earnings end up accruing.
But I think almost certainly
when one day we look back,
if one day we look back
and they were no longer as dominant from a
from a market cap perspective, it's
going to be
because their earnings aren't as dominant
either.
You know, we started this conversation
talking about the CPI number
that came out and I would be curious
to hear just how unusual this year
has been in terms of tracking
some of the data and dealing with,
you know, things that you probably haven't
had to deal with as an economist before,
like tariffs on, you know, some tiny
Pacific Island or something like that.
I would echo what Ben, just say said
it's this is what makes markets
and economic
forecasting fun
that there's always something new.
And of course, the extent of the tariff
increases that we saw on
and around Liberation Day
is, if not unprecedented, then at least,
we haven't seen that in many,
many decades.
So that's that
that's a new set of challenges
in terms of figuring out
what the impacts are going to be.
It's not as extreme
as what we've seen at times in the prior
20 years or so,
certainly compared with Covid.
I mean, that's where you could effectively
throw out a lot of the government data
and have to look for other indicators,
like cell phone locations
to figure out what was going on.
That if not that day,
then at least that week.
And, you know, not,
not a month a month earlier.
So that that's been a challenge
the government shutdown, I would say,
has been more challenging than past
strategies, will actually have holes
in the economic data
that will probably be there for ever.
And, you know,
you look at some of the labor market
numbers, we've had a consistent series
for the U.S unemployment
rate on a monthly basis since 1948,
except for October 2025.
And that's going to look pretty weird.
That's kind of crazy.
I don't think we've yet.
What is your outlook for 2026
in terms of fed policy?
Where do you see this rate cut cycle going
and how deep we still have,
forecast that we've had for the
last six months, which is,
after the
75 basis points of insurance cuts
in 2025 to more into 2026,
that bring you down to what
we think is roughly
the neutral estimate, 3 to 3.25%.
We're penciling that in for March and June
at the moment.
Haven't changed that.
I would say there's a pretty sizable
amount of uncertainty around that.
It's certainly possible
that if, you know, GDP growth
does as well as we we think,
and that actually gives
a bit more of a lift to the labor market,
that they would wait longer
and push
that perhaps into the second half.
But I'm also pretty focused on January 9th
when we get the next employment report,
because if that shows another increase
in the unemployment rate,
then I think it might be hard
not to cut at the January meeting.
We don't have that in the forecast
at the moment,
but I think it's a very real possibility,
something to look forward to
after we come back.
Yeah, holidays currently,
I think according to work it's
just a less than 20% chance
of a cut in January.
But it's and I know you don't expect one,
but I guess it sounds like
there's a condition
in which that could jump.
Yes, I think so.
jan and Ben, thank you so much for
coming on Odd Lots
And, I guess
we'll have you back on next year, right?
Yeah. Make it an annual tradition. Yeah.
Check your forecasts against reality.
So thanks.
Thank you so much.
Thank you very much. It was really great.
Well, Joe, that's always fun I love that.
I do think the point about, you know,
whether or not we're in a bubble,
the one thing that like, does
give me some caution
is this idea that, like, actually
everyone's kind of worried about it
at the moment and people are talking
about the downside, potential downsides.
But that said, I also think back
to the internet bubble, the dotcom bubble.
And I mean,
people were so worried about it.
They were writing books about a dotcom
bubble right at the time.
At the time, yeah.
Before it actually burst.
So I don't, you know, we've had bubbles
before where people have been worried
and they're still bubbles. Yeah.
Merely observing that does not obviate
the existence of one.
That's right.
A couple things.
So I, I love that, Jan pushed back on
this, very, almost consensus meme
that AI expenditure has been
a huge driver of GDP expansion this year.
And when you talk about,
I think, you know,
I think it's a it's interesting
to hear him push back so hard on that,
given how much of what gets put into
the ground comes out on the other side.
Via imports.
I also, you know, look, I'm,
I love Ben's point about,
you know, you say whatever you will
about the big tech companies.
They deliver monster earnings every year.
And it's very interesting to hear how,
like, over the last five years, you know,
look at this crazy concentration.
And then they catch up there to earnings.
And it turns out
the market was right again.
Right.
And it's also true as you pointed out,
that some non-tech companies
are seeing earnings growth too.
So it's not even a market
that's as dominated by big tech
as it was just like two weeks ago.
I'm sure that I have contributed
in various times to the sort of meme
that it's just a tech driven,
you know, you're like, we say that, right?
This tech driven rally in 2025
and obviously, look, the Nasdaq
has outperformed the S&P 500 this year.
So we know that like yes
tech has outperformed.
But you know
financials have done very well.
It is I I hadn't appreciated
how consistently strong
the earnings growth of the S&P for 93
had been over the last three years.
I also think this idea of productivity
keeping unemployment
stuck at like 4.5% is an interesting one.
People, I think, tend to think of higher
productivity as a good thing.
Yeah, obvious reasons.
But, you know, there's so much political,
nervousness at the moment about jobs
and economic security.
If we have a massive productivity boost
that ends with people not having as many.
Good job. Yeah.
That'll be interesting.
I still think there's a huge question
mark, obviously, like what
I ultimately means for the labor market.
But this idea that, like,
it could raise the frictional unemployment
so not necessarily sustained change
the number of people who have jobs,
but the time it takes to find a job
and various other things because
it just so economy
wide is like maybe that's a useful.
I think that's a useful way
to think about the question,
at least in the short and medium
term. Yeah.
All right. Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
Okay.
