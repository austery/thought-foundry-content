You're a pizza fanatic.
You love it so much.
You decide to every single meal of every
single day for the rest of your life.
Like you are committed
to subsisting on pizza.
Committed to the carbs.
Exactly. So, Joe, you made that decision.
You come to me and you say,
hey, Dan, I'm going to eat pizza
for every meal of my entire life.
How about you open a pizza restaurant
for me to eat it?
Here's how we're going to fund it.
10% equity.
The bank is going to give you 90%
of the funding in leverage.
And it's dad's restaurant.
Now, Tracy, Joe comes to you
for a personal loan to fund his lifestyle,
his pizza eating choices.
Tracy, trust me, she would lend it to me.
Well, here's the question. Right?
Should you?
Tracy,
consider the 90% levered pizza restaurant
that Joe is eating at for all his meals?
Now, on the one hand, it's
not Joe's loan, right?
So he's not on the hook.
If the pizza restaurant goes under.
On the other hand,
it's Joe's only source of food
which will die without the restaurant,
which is his.
He's committed to the restaurant,
and it kind of makes the restaurant
intertwined with Joe's ability
to pay your personal loan back.
So I guess that's a question. No.
There's great.
So now who's now that.
Let's take it out of pizza.
Who is?
So that's whatever.
Like, okay, now
who is the chips buyer? Whatever.
This is essentially what's happening
with off balance sheet financing and data
Hello and welcome to another episode
of the Odd Lots podcast.
I'm Joe Weisenthal and I'm Tracy Alloway.
Tracy, there just so many credit
related things to talk about right now.
I'll take credit.
I love it.
I love it.
Credit is interesting again.
This might be one of the only credit
episodes that we've ever done where, like,
I found the guest, because I feel like
when I think about, like, a credit,
all the credit episodes, it's
usually like someone, you know,
and randomly I've found someone who knows
a little bit something about credit.
So I was like, oh, let me do it. Let me.
The stakes are high.
I know I was thinking about that
because, you know,
how do you, like, pick
someone who, like, doesn't know anything?
No, I don't think that.
I think we have
a very knowledgeable credit guest.
But I'm a little stressed
about this aspect. I believe in you, Joe.
You do?
I trust your judgment.
But to your point, there's a lot going on.
So obviously there are concerns around
private credit.
We've had some idiosyncratic defaults
and frauds in the market,
and each one is special in their own way.
But I think the worrying aspect is
that they keep coming to light.
Yeah, right.
And so you've seen people like Jamie
Dimon using the cockroach analogy,
which is now famous.
And at the same time
you have the connection with AI, right?
Yes, which we have spoken about a little
bit on the podcast with Paul Khodorkovsky,
all these complex
circular financing structures
that are driving a lot of the credit boom
or have been driving
a lot of the credit boom.
And then at the same time,
you also have the impact of AI on credit
itself.
Yeah. That's right.
Because in theory, right.
Like we've talked about this,
we did that episode with Joel Wertheimer.
That was in a slightly different context.
But we've done these episodes about,
you know, just the incredible
length of deal text, etc.
and perhaps if there's one area
where maybe we could say
with some high degree of confidence
that large language models could be useful
in is can we break down this,
you know, multi hundred page agreement
so that we don't have to have, you know,
junior associates or junior lawyers
or junior bankers
up until four in the morning
making sure that every comma
is in the right place, etc..
In theory, this could be an area
in which I could be productively applied.
You know, there was an actual case
argued over a comma.
Oh yeah.
I can't remember exactly what it was,
but like, you're absolutely right.
The grammar, the specific words
clearly matter in legal language.
I would just add one of the things
that's been driving, arguably driving
private credit is the boom in credit
or on credit or violence in public deals.
Yeah.
So it was this idea that you could avoid
that by having, you know, this private,
close relationship with your borrower
where you are higher up in the waterfall.
Yeah. Of payment.
So this is important.
It would be really nice
if you could upload
a credit agreement to you and just say,
make sure there's nothing in here
that would get me in trouble.
Make sure there's nothing in here
that would,
You know that five years later,
I will regret the placement of a server.
Make sure I don't lose money.
Make sure I don't lose money
in some technical way anyway,
so there's just a lot going on.
I feel like there's plenty of episodes
to do on this.
But we really do have the perfect guest.
Someone who literally sort of sits
in the intersection of,
I think we identified
three distinct trends here.
We are going to be speaking with Dan
Wertman.
He's the co-founder of a company called, 
Noetic AI.
And it does exactly this.
It sort of attempts to use
AI to understand credit.
So there's a lot of understanding
about deals and the text in them.
But he also just
has a lot of understanding about AI etc..
So can talk about all these things.
Dan, thank you
so much for coming on the podcast.
Thanks so much for having me.
I'm a fan of the show. Love to hear it.
You guys are kind of
like celebrities for me. So
it's, it's kind of fitting
that I'm here
because, now, folks, I'm here
at least with the folks at Bloomberg,
because many people think about us.
I know I,
I like the Bloomberg for deal terms.
Okay. Well, let's see let's see if,
you actually live up to that.
No. But,
so since I said I'm stressed that,
this time we're doing a credit episode,
and I found the guest.
Can you give us
your give us the quick version of,
like, your career and what Noetic is?
Yeah.
So, start with no idea what we build at.
Noetic, is a AI powered software
for benchmarking real time
data on what's market and credit, M&A,
capital markets, deal terms.
Okay.
So another way we help folks
like transactional attorneys,
credit managers, bankers,
we help them figure out whether the terms
of their transactional agreements
like think, financing agreements,
merger agreements, prospectuses
and really all other
corporate transactions are on or off
market
by benchmarking them to market comps.
So as far as the genesis, you know,
what ago,
it was kind of born
out of my own experience and my career.
So I started my career at Blackrock.
I was on a team responsible
for coming up with new financial products
and fixing and markets,
and we were developing
these new, interesting,
innovative, structured products.
And I just learned a ton
about the capital markets ecosystem
and in particular,
just this is a $50 trillion global market.
Yeah. And it runs on
phone calls and relationships
and it's unbelievably antiquated.
Then fast forward
I went back to get my JD.
I joined, walked I lived in where I did
corporate transactions.
This was 2017 to 2022.
So if you guys remember that time
it was heyday of merger activity, right?
So I worked on, you know, T-Mobile's
buyout of sprint, the biggest 30 million.
Our commitment at the time,
Allegan Avenue to see Raytheon.
And I distinctly remember
sitting down my desk,
I was looking at a transactional group
and a multi-billion dollar merger,
and I was looking
at a term, and I was trying to figure out
whether I should help my client
except term A or term B in this context.
And I was stuck.
So I called a senior partner on the deal.
I said, hey,
where are the database of information?
Where I could see
exactly how this term should come out
and quantify it for my client.
And, you know,
the answer was that doesn't exist.
Now, that was, you know,
two and a half plus years ago now,
I left hotel to start Nautica
with a fairly simple idea,
which is AI enables us to finally quantify
what market agreement
terms should look like in these markets.
You know, now we work with almost
all the top 20 law firms on the street.
We're helping them
advise their clients on these deals.
And this year, we're on track
to do about $1
trillion of transactions
through the platform.
And you get 1% of that. So that's great.
Well, talk to
us about, what these financing agreements
actually look like and how traditionally
they're sort of judged
by both the investors and the lawyers
who are looking at them.
Yeah.
I mean, so when I say deal terms,
what I mean is deal
terms are really the underpinning
of the entire transactional system.
The rules of the road.
You could think about them like speed
limits, double yellow lines, lights.
They're kind of the plumbing
that goes into the transactions.
Putting in a way
that people can understand.
Imagine I go sign a lease.
Most people are very familiar
with certain things.
Right.
Like the rent price, the
how long the lease is subletting policy.
Exactly.
But if deep in that 20 page lease,
the lease says if the weather
gets under 30 degrees at any time, you for
for your right to the apartment.
Well that's a deal term and that affects
whether you want
to accept that lease or not.
And so it's the same in capital markets
terms.
To give you a more tangible example.
Yeah.
You know, are you guys fast food people?
Yes, yes. Okay.
So I'm like a McDonald's guy. Yeah.
And whenever I go to McDonald's, I always
order the Tempe Chicken McNuggets.
And there's. I've.
I've ordered the ten piece
hundreds of times.
There's exactly three things that happen.
You order Tempe, you open the box,
you have nine pieces,
you open the box,
you have exactly ten pieces.
Or you open the box
and you have 11 pieces.
Now, if you have nine pieces,
you go to the counter and you say, hey,
I'm missing a piece.
They give you a piece,
you get the benefit.
You're working, you get ten.
You you enjoy your McNuggets.
If you get 11, what do you do?
You stay quiet.
Exactly.
So you hit the jackpot, right?
Now, there's this kind of unwritten rule
in American consumerism, which is that
if a company that's bigger
than you gives you something by accident,
then you get the benefit of that
as a consumer.
Well, in 2020,
the exact kind
of thing happened in the credit markets.
But it ended very differently.
Citibank sent $900 million to lenders
in full pre-payment of a loan for Revlon,
and they did so accidentally.
Now they were supposed to just send
an interest payment.
At the time, the terms of the credit
agreement were silent.
The governing documentation
associated with this loan
didn't say what happens in that scenario.
Long story short,
many funds did not get back that hundreds
of millions of dollars
and litigation ensued.
But a deal term in credit
deals, called erroneous payment
deal terms, started
popping up in the market.
Nordica's data last clocked that deal term
as of last quarter, 90% of deals.
So if you don't have that term
now in your deal,
you're way off market in terms of the way
the market actually operates.
This is why the alternative is important.
These are hundreds of millions of dollars
at stake in the context
of all these years.
There's
something very lawyerly about, like,
I have to say,
I've never counted the McNuggets.
I usually get it.
So just as I would,
this example
would have never occurred to me,
because I'm not the type of person
that opens a box of McNuggets. And.
Clearly you don't value McNuggets enough.
Evidently. Evidently not.
What are some other deal terms?
So that's a great example of that. Okay.
Now, after that incident,
which was infamous, language about this
started popping up.
What are some other sort of classic.
And I'm sure they get much,
much more esoteric than that.
But what are some other like key
interesting deal terms
that trend over time?
Yeah. So it's really interesting.
So there's a whole host of what
I would call structural protections,
all these deals.
These come in a lot of different flavors.
Many people talk about them
as things like anti PetSmart terms,
things like J.Crew blockers, things
like certain protections.
Let's talk about some of these right.
Yeah. Let's talk about some of these.
So you know anti PetSmart terms.
These are protections
that prevent guarantor releases
when subsidiaries of the credit group
become not wholly owned.
In other words it prevents value
from being transferred away from the loan
into some other structure
which doesn't provide credits for it.
Let me put this in a way
that most people to understand.
If you were getting
a mortgage on your house.
Pretty simple framework.
You take out the debt, you pay your
mortgage payments, you pay back a loan.
Bank and foreclose on your house.
If you stopped paying a mortgage.
But in the mortgage,
if it said something like, well,
if you sell any part of your home
front door, a window,
a shingle, the bank loses the ability
to foreclose on the house fully.
Well, then what would you do?
You would sell a single shingle.
You would stop paying your mortgage,
and you get to keep your house
and you get the benefit of that.
That's
what anti PetSmart terms actually prevent.
They prevent the ability for credit groups
to actually sell a single equity
and actually lose the credits
for from that particular equity.
So it's kind of interesting
what we're seeing in the market right now.
We have this really unique vantage point
from the point of view of our software,
where we quantify trends in deal
terms over time.
And so we can actually very precisely
tell you the percentages of deals
are actually getting a lot
of these structural protections
and actually gives us this really unique
window into the into the anxieties
and the optimism that are currently
happening in the market.
Some people think about this
as kind of an early signal
of something likely to come.
So what are we seeing?
Well, we're calling it a flight
to fortification.
And it's really happening on both issuers
and powers.
I'll explain what I mean.
We're seeing massive increases
in lenders getting structural protections
in these deals.
Basically, the protections they help
make sure their collateral is locked.
Things like the anti PetSmart terms.
And we'll talk about a bunch
a few more in return.
Borrowers are getting
the same fortification.
In fact they're getting more economic
flexibility.
Yeah.
And you could think about it
as a way for them to weather
the storm is how we're seeing it.
So things like add backs to EBITDA.
Yeah.
More ability to send money
to shareholders, more ability
to make long term investments.
Let's talk about the actual specifics
of what we're seeing and more in terms
of what I just talked about.
We clocked that at 28% of deals in Q3.
That was at 4% in 2023.
It was in Q2 is at 25% is
the highest we've ever recorded that term.
J.Crew blockers,
which prevent issuers from moving material
IP outside the credit group.
That's at 45% of deals now.
The baseline from 2023 15%.
And last quarter it was 38%.
Anti sort of protections
which are lean subordination protections.
They actually help
secure your place in line
if and when some sort of distressed
activity happens.
That's at 84% of deals.
That's the highest jump we've ever seen.
Quarter over quarter
it went up from 61% to 23 point jump.
And the baseline was 39% in 2023.
That's pretty significant
for a quarterly jump.
And it really signals
something about the market.
On the quantitative side,
we track a lot of stuff too,
including the ratios under
which borrowers need to maintain
specific types of leverage.
We saw that at 3.9 times EBITDA,
in Q2, and it went down to three
and a half times.
But again,
that's signaling some sort of anxiety
among the lender group
that, that we wouldn't normally see.
Now, you may ask,
what about getting to this?
Again, they're getting more fortification.
One of the ways
this is coming up is in EBITDA.
Ibex.
You're familiar with EBITDA? Yeah. Okay.
So EBITDA, ibex.
Basically, there's a very long
and complicated calculation of cash flow.
And a lot of these deals
and the add backs to EBITDA,
basically allow borrowers
and issuers to add back certain things
to count them as cash flow to flatter
their balance sheet basis.
Correct, correct.
One of the more interesting add backs
that we track is
what's called a cost savings add back.
So imagine a borrower knows it's
going to optimize some cost in the future.
If it can reasonably predict that cost,
it can add that back to today's cash flow.
That cost savings out back,
whether it materializes
or not,
is added back to to its cash flow.
64% of deals
now have cost savings in them.
That's the highest we've ever recorded.
20%, for deals with,
those add backs being above
20% of EBITDA, that came in at 51%,
which is also the highest we've ever
tracked, on the platform.
They're also getting things
like excluding lenders
that are short in their debt.
So, for instance, folks
who may be familiar with
what happened with the Windstream case, 
a few years ago.
What happened in that case is certain
hedge funds were actually
short.
The debt,
the the loan that was in default.
And that makes them, not exactly aligned
with the company
that has the debt outstanding.
Term started popping up in the market,
which we've tracked, which are called net
short lender terms, which allow borrowers
to exclude those lenders from voting.
That is now in 13% of deals,
which is the highest we've ever tracked.
So you could see the fortification
actually on both sides of the market.
And it really signals,
I think, to us that there's
a risk allocation happening,
with a lot of these, these anxieties.
So, Joe, first of all, you know,
my husband was a corporate lawyer
at one point. Yes.
Okay, so one of the things
he's most proud of is he came up
with some language in a deal shortly
after the 2008 financial crisis.
And it was he sent it to me
just now, a significant dislocation
in financial markets.
That was him.
And that became like standard language
in risk factors,
at least in a bunch of books.
It's like that's his contribution.
I'm the inventor of this deal.
So and so so so the invent.
Some people invent great medicine.
Some people invent some new technology,
and someone invents a New Deal
term that gets propagated across.
That's right. Documents for years
there on after.
That's how it works. But, Dan,
I wanted to ask you something.
Okay, so you say there's
more fortification in a lot of deal terms.
More protections,
perhaps, for both investors and lenders.
I guess.
One of the things we heard, you know,
prior to 2020, and then for some years
after it was we had this explosion
in covet deals, right.
Fewer protections for investors
because everyone
was so desperate, supposedly for yield
for that particular paper.
So the balance of power
shifted to the borrowers.
They were able to dictate the terms.
How are investors
getting better protections now with,
you know, credit spreads
still at basically multi-decade lows,
which suggests that there's
still a lot of demand
and that they don't hold
all the power in the market.
Yeah, I, I think about it
and what the data supports.
That we see on the platform
is I think about it less.
So is what they're getting more
about what the terms actually reflect
in terms of the macro environment
that they're operating in.
So for instance, right now
we're seeing this flight of fortification
in part
largely due to probably a few things.
Number one being,
you know, some of these headline risks
that folks have been talking about.
And I'm sure we'll get into some of what's
going on in the private credit
market today.
So people
flooding into more structural protections
because they're worried about their place
in line if there is distress.
I think number two is just macro wise.
If you think about it, in the credit
markets, there was a ton of debt
taken out in 2020,
2021, 2020, early part of 2022.
This leads
to a lot of maturity walls upcoming.
Especially in 2027.
We don't say upcoming on the show.
We say looming. Yeah, looming.
Yeah, exactly.
There are a lot of looming
maturity walls.
In 2028, 2029, vintage.
And you can think about it as well.
That's a macro factor
that people are thinking about when they,
when they underwrite alone.
Because many of these deals
actually have five year tenor,
you know, seven year, 10 or 8 year
tenure, in some cases 30 year tenor.
And so they're thinking about all these
protections in the context of that market.
I also think it's really interesting,
aside from the credit context right now,
we're seeing a lot of structuring in terms
happening in M&A markets.
So, you know, things like regulatory
uncertainty, things like tariffs,
things like,
you know, liability management,
as we talked about things like tack ons,
tax uncertainty.
Yeah, I'm happy to go into these.
But we're seeing a lot of things
in this area.
You know one kind of small example,
this in situations
where, a buyer and a seller
have regulatory uncertainty, which,
you know, a lot of folks
think about the administration
and they're not sure exactly how things
are, how things are going to play out.
You actually see regulatory
review in deals get hyper focused on.
And it actually precipitated
a New Deal term
this year, which we tracked in the market.
We had a long term
detection on the platform.
We sent out a note to all of our clients,
and it's called a new outside debt
structure term.
Basically,
what it does is it allows buyers
of of, of, acquirer fees.
It allows them to lock
in their financing for longer
and actually extend their financing.
In the case scenario
where regulatory review lacks.
And that's just an example
of the kind of innovation that's happening
in the merger,
markets in terms of tariffs.
We picked up the first tariff
event of default in a credit deal ever.
It happened in a superior industries
deal over the summer,
which, probably is unsurprising to you
as an auto manufacturer deal
that made a lot of parts in Mexico.
That's down 5% of M&A deals, for
for tariff based M&A carve outs
and a lot of respect clauses.
Can we talk a little bit about, 
you know, you're scanning these documents.
You know, Google's
Ingram has existed for a long time
tracking the the prevalence of a of a
term is not novel technology. Yeah.
Control f. Control f. Yeah I do that.
This is sort of like very it's barely even
conscious of technology at that point.
What is it that you, you know,
when you're talking about the changing
prevalence of these terms,
what is the actual novel
t here that isn't just sort of,
you know, document search over time?
Yeah.
So Tracy, your your husband,
former corporate lawyer, you know,
he would cover in corporate lawyer.
You're covering for where exactly?
I am myself as well.
Well, one of the things he would tell you
is that there's constant innovation
in these markets.
These agreements are highly complicated.
They're very long.
They have a lot of what's called
long range dependencies, which is that
you may be used to seeing something
in a particular area of the document
said one way,
but in reality, it turns out it's punted
to three different causes deep down.
And you actually,
if you'll find that information,
this is why it's also jujitsu between
the borrowers and the lenders, right?
Because like the borrowers are often
trying to hide something that's favorable
to them, or the lenders are trying to hide
something favorable to them.
So the structure and the way it's worded
changes a lot.
To your point. Exactly.
And these are sophisticated parties
paying millions, sometimes
hundreds of millions of dollars
in advisory fees
to make sure that these terms
look the way they do.
Now, that leads to kind
of the technological innovation
that I think has enabled a lot of this.
I, for the first time, can attribute
in particular, new language
models can attribute more semantic
meaning to phrases and language
that was impossible
with things like engrams.
And so, when I think it does
is it uses a series of language models,
including a multi-layered information
extraction system, to make sure
that it's encoding all the semantic
meaning inside all these terms,
so that when you look at a J.Crew back
or in the first way, it may be phrased
a thousand different, different ways,
but we can track that term over time.
That has enabled the ability
to actually quantify
for the first time what a market agreement
term looks like in these markets.
And I think that's why, it's so
interesting to folks on the platform.
So I know you're not doing litigation, but
I guess I'm curious how you deal with or
if AI is helpful with in litigation,
what would be called precedent.
But I'm assuming you're building up
a big database
of all these different deal documents.
Is it useful?
Is AI useful to go back
and look at previous documents
in order to shape new ones?
Yeah, exactly. So a new idea.
We are ultimately an air power
software company, but we actually have
the largest knowledge graph of deal terms
in existence of traces.
Exactly what you said.
It's a database ultimately of precedent,
comparable deal terms.
And that database is going to be mind
blowing, but has over billion terms in it.
So it's actually the largest in existence.
We map that back to deal characteristics.
It's the same in litigation. Right.
So in transactional markets,
you know, folks are innovative,
but they also want to rely on something
that has happened before,
or at least in part they want to rely on
something that has happened before.
And so folks are constantly looking for
ways to tie things back to comparable
deal terms.
It's the same in litigation.
So obviously not my expertise,
but the same concept, which is,
you know, when you write a brief,
you are constantly citing cases
that the judge has,
you know, relied on in the past.
And, you know, for lawyers
and you know, that sort of lawyers
even just deal professionals, generally
bankers, credit managers, 
people are highly reliant on precedent.
What is your tech stack?
Did you
what do you build and how much is it like?
Oh, you're using ChatGPT API etc..
Like, okay, yes, large language
models are good
at identifying deal terms or novel
tier, etc.
there's semantic meaning of these terms,
but what did you actually build
and what do you actually employ
in your technology?
It's a we we're starting in 2022.
So we're what you would call a AI native.
Yeah.
We were started in a system that already
and language models existed in,
however, we because of the nature
of the sensitive documents and terms
that we deal with, especially for,
you know, major law firms financials.
Yeah.
This is like a big issue. Yeah. Right.
That they don't want to
just be uploading their stuff to ChatGPT.
Right. Exactly.
And so we actually utilize, you know,
adopted language models, open source
language models that we adopt on our own
proprietary data sets
and then deploy and secure environments
and single tenant architectures,
you know, for individual instances
of institutions that deploy our product.
And so you could think about it
as based on the language models that,
you know, are ultimately underpinning
a lot of the GPT is in the clouds.
However, it's
fine tuned to this particular data set,
which makes it obviously much better
at handling this exact problem.
Which is a big problem in the market.
Now, we also layer on
top of that information extraction model.
So for instance, you may know that a term
exists and ideal, but,
you may want to know
what terms should exist for a JP Morgan
deal or for a B value or for, you know,
a particular type of counterparty.
And so in those contexts,
we actually want to map those deal
terms back to deal characteristics.
And we actually utilize a lot of models
to extract information
and and marry
that with third party data sets.
So that's a little bit
about how the technology works
I think I always think about it
from the user standpoint.
What is the user really want.
These are really wants to know
how they're going to advise
their client on a particular merger
and a particular credit deal.
How often does this come up?
You always call your attorney and you're
trying to figure out all this market.
Is it off market?
And that's what our data provides okay.
So structural
fortifications in deal terms.
What are you seeing right now.
Because as we started this conversation,
we were talking a lot
about the recent blow
ups in the private credit market.
And if you look at, 
you know, some spreads on certain
firms, certain bonds,
it does seem like nervousness
is creeping back into the market.
I see spreads
on, you know, it's not private credit,
but spreads on, triple C
rated debt have been creeping up recently.
How scared or concerned are people
right now?
Well, I, I recently, wrote about this
in the Wall Street Journal a little bit.
And then,
you know, folks contacted me and,
and kind of said,
you know, you're causing a stir.
And, and
then I
saw Howard Marks came out with his letter,
which I think was called
cockroaches in the coal mine.
And it had a lot of the same themes.
I think folks who have been around
credit market
for a long time can, can kind of see
what's a little bit of what's going on.
To us.
Let me just talk about what
the data supports to us.
What we see is creditors may be preparing
this syst their system for distress.
Okay.
And I'll talk about what we're seeing
in the data that kind of supports that.
But, you could think about it
like the evolution of
your house security. Right?
So, you know, first you lock the doors,
then you know, you get a bolt lock,
you know, then,
which gives you better protection,
you know, then you, you know,
you had a security system on top of that,
an alarm system.
And at the end, what do you do?
You kind of count up all your valuables
and you insure them.
If people are going to get into the house.
And, you know, for the past few years,
we've seen lenders
really focus on keeping people out.
This is the locks and the deadbolt,
and this is what we were talking about
with J.Crew blockers.
It says
making sure you can't structure around me
from a liability management perspective.
But over the last quarter,
something kind of changed, which is
we started seeing people and lenders
obsessed with lean subordination terms,
which is the term that governs
who gets paid
first when everything falls apart.
So this isn't really about preventing
liability management exercises that much.
It's actually
about controlling the recovery.
When a bankruptcy does happen.
And, and so we clock that term
it 84% of deals in Q3.
Biggest quarterly jump we've ever seen
from from from the prior quarter.
It's also the highest we've ever clocked
that term.
So this begs the question of why.
Why are creditors so focused on
making sure the place in line
is in recovery, and recovery is the same?
Perhaps it's a reaction
to the liability management
transactions we've talked about.
So perhaps folks are thinking
that that will precipitate perhaps into
reaction to some of the maturity walls
that folks understand.
Or perhaps it's some of what I was saying
in the op ed, which is
folks are seeing that there may be
distress events on the horizon,
and they want to make sure that
if there is, they have
the most negotiating leverage as possible.
So I know it's broad statements, but,
you know,
when we look at the sort of environment
under which companies
like First Brands or Tree
or some of these other ones
that have gone into distress very rapidly,
when we look back at
when these were birthed, etc.,
can we say like there was a
dus were sloppy times.
These were loose, sloppy times that, 
people were not thinking much about either
just quality due diligence or diligent, 
terms.
Yeah.
So I think with First Brands
is a great example or so.
First brands
is an automotive replacement
company. Right.
So they, they make things like brakes
and light wipers and filtration systems.
Beginning in 2019,
that company effectively
rapidly expanded through debt
fueled acquisitions.
And it dramatically increased its scale.
But I think what First brands illustrates
is something that, you know,
we might get into with the private credit
markets, which is that, you know,
they primarily funded these acquisitions
with large debt facilities.
Then tariffs hit in April 2025,
which obviously changed their business
because they actually do
a lot of manufacturing
and that kind of magnified problems.
So you can think about
one of the main problems
with first brands, which is also kind of
some of what folks are worried
about in the private credit markets today
is what's called off
balance sheet financing.
Well, first,
brands used is a lot of kind of,
you know, receivables
financing facilities that weren't properly
disclosed to a lot of folks
that were lending to the company.
In fact, I think in that sense,
just to give you a sense of quantum,
this is over $11
billion of total obligations that they had
when they actually, started disclosing it
in terms of off balance sheet financing.
And, you know,
they were disclosing things like 5
to $6 billion
of actual, debt obligations.
And so
this led one of the creditor lawyers was,
say, the $2.3 billion just disappeared.
And so that structure,
the ability for first Prince to get that
debt,
was made possible
by the private credit markets
and how deep the private credit
markets have become,
because if you're a big credit manager
and private credit markets,
you could fund,
you know, that type of receivables
facility to a first brands
and first brands
could use that facility to then,
you know, make sure they are constantly,
continuing to acquire new businesses
and, and keep rolling over the the cash.
I have a theory that,
receivables financing and factoring
is to the private credit market.
What, French quants
who went to that one really elite school,
I like to say,
are to, to trading blow ups.
I like that theory. Yeah.
So the other thing we wanted to ask you
about, and again, we references in
the intro, is we are seeing
these really complicated deals
that I admittedly cannot
keep track of in the AI market, where,
you know, one company is going to buy
chips from this other company,
and then that company is going to borrow
from whoever and use the chips funding
to pay them back.
And then that money
somehow goes into the company
that is buying the stuff
in the first place.
It is all very circular,
all very incestuous in many ways.
In my mind, how are you examining
those types of deals
or just putting on your credit expertise?
Hat if you see something like that,
what are you thinking?
Yeah, well, it's
probably helpful to kind of talk about
some of the structure of these deals,
which I think, again,
is made possible by how deep
the private credit markets have become.
And usually when I
do that, I try to think about, let's
try to make this a little bit more fun.
So imagine for a minute, Joe,
you just love pizza.
Yeah, he does love pizza.
I had to yesterday twice.
There you go. You're a pizza fanatic.
You decide to eat pizza.
You love it so much, you decide.
Peter, every single meal of every
single day for the rest of your life.
You are committed to subsisting on pizza,
committed to the carbs.
Exactly. So, Joe, you made that decision.
You come to me and you say,
hey, Dan, I'm going to eat pizza
for every meal of my entire life.
How about you open a pizza restaurant
for me to eat it?
That'll be really lucrative.
Yeah, I see where I was customary.
We were going with this, but this is
actually a very good analogy, right?
Like,
you'd have to have a lot of confidence
in me to commit to my word
if you're going to open a restaurant.
Yeah.
Now, you know, you come to me,
you say it's going to be super lucrative.
Yeah, here's how we're going to fund it.
10% equity.
The bank is going to give you 90%
of the funding in leverage.
And it stands Restaurant
Joe, you don't own the restaurant, 
but you're going to eat at it.
I'm the full beneficiary,
full beneficiary of the restaurant,
but it's 90% levered okay.
So I open the restaurant.
You eat there every single day.
Now, Tracy Jill comes to you
for a personal loan
to fund his lifestyle, his pizza eating.
Tracy. Trust me, she would lend it to me.
Yeah, well, here's the question. Right?
Should you, Tracy,
consider the 90% levered pizza restaurant
that Joe is eating at for all his meals?
Now, on the one hand, it's
not Joe's loan, right?
So he's not on the hook
if the pizza restaurant goes under.
On the other hand, it's
Joe's only source of food
which will die without the restaurant,
which is his.
He's committed to the restaurant and,
you know, it kind of makes the restaurant
intertwined with Joe's ability
to pay your personal loan back.
So I guess that's the question.
No. That's great.
So now who's now
the let's take it out of pizza.
Who is?
So that's whatever.
Like, okay, now
who is the chips buyer or whatever.
This is essentially
what's happening with off balance.
You financing and data center deals.
So and includes matters.
I I'm sure you saw the Hyperion deal
which is met as an infrastructure
deal with Blue Owl.
Except I think it's even more intriguing
than some of the pizza stuff.
So Meta and Blue Owl
basically created a joint venture
in a special purpose vehicle.
Not that different than the restaurant.
And the deal is the joint venture would be
owned 20% by meta, 80% by Blue Owl.
So Blue Owl controls it and it would
effectively be funded with 90% leverage.
So call it $30
billion of total enterprise value, $3
billion of equity,
$27 billion, give or take of debt.
In other words, Blue Owl's effectively
owning the restaurant.
Meta is effectively
eating at the restaurant,
and the banks fund it with 90% leverage.
So what this does is it
keeps the debt off of Meta's books,
right, while also giving investors
credit managers
the ability to put money
against a data center asset.
So meta in this deal
will make rent payments
associated with the data center
based on its cost of power.
That's the cash flow
that's going to the SPV,
and that effectively funds
the interest expense.
Let's just talk about the debt
for a second.
Yeah.
In a normal LBO context,
which you guys
probably talked about many times
here, 90% leverage
is pretty exceptionally high.
Most people would consider 50 to 80%
leveraged be relatively normal
for a stable cash flow business.
So the debt itself is actually
quite high on on some of these structures.
The only reason it was possible
was because it was given
an investment grade credit rating,
and in part because meta agreed
to a four year operating lease with
what's called a residual value guarantee,
which means that meta is guaranteeing
a capped amount of some of that cash flow.
However, that guarantee is capped
and is only partial,
which is why they don't
have to take it onto their books.
And why would be a footnote
as a contingent debt
obligation on their balance sheet.
Now let's talk about the asset
that's being underwritten.
This isn't pizza.
Pizza actually has a stable price for
if we've thousands of views of history
on pizza. Right.
And you can track that price over time.
Data center is optimized
for GPU performance on training
fundamental AI models.
Not so much of a mature asset,
actually.
I think most folks would think about it
as a burgeoning asset.
Now I'm in this world.
I mean, folks,
there's a high amount of demand
for a lot of this compute,
and I definitely think, you know,
the demand is there, but
at the end of the day, it's an immature
asset with a price
that isn't so well defined.
So just to recap, you've got off
balance sheet financing, which isn't
reflected with whoever is lending money
to meta or even buying its equity
with 90% leverage on an immature asset.
And I think that's why
these deals are so interesting.
So from our point of view, I mean,
to make sure you get the terms right.
And, you know,
we will look at these data center,
a lot of these, these types of financing
to run through our platform all the time
to make sure you get the terms. Right.
What this structural protections
look like in these deals is critical
for the fortification of something,
that is in the structure.
So I know we've seen these idiosyncratic
blow ups in the private credit market
so far, but just looking at the AI market
in particular and the financing there,
it feels like right now
people are still willing to lend money.
And we've talked about this
on the show before, but a lot of the AI
competition is couched
in this existential language of you,
either
you know, when it AI or die, basically.
And so the spending keeps going.
What is your guess on?
Like the thing
that kind of knocks that cycle
or that flywheel, and tear it apart?
I mean,
to I'm obviously in the industry
where we're in the credit industry.
So we see both sides of this phenomenon.
I fundamentally believe
AI is a paradigm shift.
I would not have left, you know,
the deal markets if I didn't think that.
And I think what we're witnessing
is very similar to the internet
in the 1990s and or the iPhone in 2000
or so for media in the 20 tens.
And I think this paradigm shift is going
to ultimately change a ton of industries,
including capital markets and finance
and law and all these amazing industries.
And, and so that I think is very true.
But I also think two things can be true.
I think I can be a generation
defining category.
And a technology
that's upending a lot of industries.
But I also think that categories
will have winners and losers.
And when folks are racing
to define a category, as you know,
you often see with a lot of these
transformational types of technology,
there may be more losers in the headlines
than you're used to seeing
in a lot of these markets.
But the winners will be
bigger than anyone's ever imagined.
All right, so if I don't eat the pizza,
someone else is going to
pick up the pizza, and they're going to
they're going to eat it.
Look what we focus on.
I know what I get is in a market
moving this fast.
Yeah.
We all need to pay attention to the terms
actually underpinning
a lot of these markets to make sure
if there is any bleeding,
that bleeding gets stopped
as quickly as possible.
You know, just to give you
one last example from a recent market
deal, you can look at the franc JPM deal
as like a really interesting one.
This is, you know,
this was a deal where JPMorgan
paid $175 million to acquire a company.
This is a very small deal.
But to acquire a company called Frank,
which is a streamlined Fafsa
kind of support service,
I know I remember this.
It turned out, yeah,
there was a lot of synthetically,
made up types of data in that business.
And the founder is going to prison, right?
Allegedly.
There's a lot of there's
a lot of made up, stuff in the business.
And I think seven days executive
who worked at Frank sent to 68 months.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And so
but I think the most interesting part
about this particular transaction to me
is JPM ended up
signing a merger agreement that said that,
the indemnification for the founders
litigation for any founders
litigation would be paid for by JPM.
Right.
They paid her lawyer,
they paid $115 million in legal
expenses for her lawyer on her fraud.
And so when you're moving really fast.
Yeah, right.
You can kind of ignore
some of the nuts and bolts.
But I think it's actually even
more critical and fast moving markets.
Dean Wortmann, co-founder of Nautica,
thank you so much for coming on.
Let's thank you.
Thanks for having me, Tracy.
I wasn't really sure
where he was going with the pizza analogy,
but it actually does make a lot of sense.
And it's something I think is a phenomenon
in just a lot of financial transactions,
which is how much like in certain
environments, the lender and the creditor
are like both each other's,
like they're both leaning on each other.
The both the creditor and lender,
they're relying on each. Yeah.
At the same time, much in the way
you rely on pizza.
You would lend to me
to buy it, to eat pizza, right?
I would thank you if it
if it was a matter of survival.
Yeah. It was a matter of survival.
Thank you.
I think it's just because you want to eat
really expensive pizza, then. No.
You know, the other thing
too, is just like from talking to you
over these years, you know,
how many times I've heard something.
Oh, there's like,
there's a lot of light stuff going.
It is interesting to think that, like,
you don't often hear that quantified
what that means, right?
Things are like covet these days, etc..
And the idea that like,
maybe we can get better numbers on
some of these things
seems like potentially labor
saving for lawyers, stuff like that.
The, the specific numbers on specific
deal terms were really interesting to me.
And the idea that even today, lawyers,
still lawyers and bankers still have
trouble, anticipate every single thing
that could happen to a particular deal.
And so they're having to react to it
and come up with the new terms,
the New Deal language,
and insert them into the documentation.
I find that interesting.
The tariff example, you know, the problem
is, is that I and this is I'm certain
we talked about this more.
I will be used to come up with New Deal
terms and the cat and mouse game
will continue forever.
So I suspect that we are not going
to have you know about
lawyers will always find new work to do,
and they'll just get work.
They'll just get more creative
about outsmarting the systems that are
designed to detect these phenomena.
We will end up with thousands
and thousands of pages of term sheets
that, like humans, are just physically
incapable of reading it
has to be read by I probably literally
that is what's going to happen.
Yeah. All right. Shall we leave it
there? Let's leave it there.
