Today I'm interviewing Casey Handmer. 
Casey has worked on a bunch of cool things. 
Caltech PhD on some gravitational wave black 
hole gimmick stuff, then Hyperloop, then the  
Jet Propulsion Laboratory at NASA.
Now he is founder and CEO of  
Terraform Industries. Casey, welcome.
Thank you. It's great to be here finally. 
Big picture question I'm interested in.
To the extent that AI just ends up being  
this big industrial race - who 
can build the most solar panels? 
Who can build the most batteries?
Who can build the most GPUs and  
transmission lines and transformers?
This is not what the US is known for,  
at least in recent decades.
This is exactly what China is known for. 
They have 20x the amount of yearly 
solar manufacturing the US has. 
Obviously we have export controls right 
now, but over time SMIC will catch up to  
TSMC's leading edge.
What is the story  
of how the United States wins this?
Why does China just not win by default? 
Do you think that China is better at 
capital allocation than the United States? 
Do you think the Chinese business environment is 
better for business than in the United States? 
I feel you can make these first principles 
arguments about these other industries where  
they're killing it, but it doesn't 
seem to have hampered BYD or CATL. 
People say they're so much better at building 
high-speed trains than the United States. 
I would never hold up a flag saying, "I'm 
really good at building high-speed trains." 
That is just a sign that you're 
really bad at capital allocation. 
Why would you devote, in 2025, so 
much industrial effort and money… 
They're devoting a lot to solar 
overcapacity, which in your opinion  
is the key to future industrial growth.
I think they might be accidentally correct. 
They called the most important thing correct, 
right? Which should count for something. 
Well, they're in a similar situation to 
Europe, but unlike the United States. 
The United States is the luckiest 
goddamn country on earth because  
it's surrounded on two sides by oceans and 
on the other two sides by friendly allies. 
China's surrounded by 15 countries 
who are mostly hostile to it,  
with no good mountain ranges or rivers 
or anything to really separate them. 
They get almost all their 
oil from the Middle East. 
From countries that they don't control, don't 
have strong diplomatic relationships with,  
on fleets of oil tankers that they can't defend 
because their navy doesn't have the ability to  
operate effectively in the Indian Ocean.
But you're working on this, right? 
If you get synthetic fuels working at 
Terraform. Doesn't that asymmetrically  
help China? Which might be fine.
It does. It absolutely asymmetrically helps  
China. We're not currently working with China, we 
don't plan to, but the physics is very obvious. 
Synthetic fuels have been around for 100 years.
There are projects in China right  
now working on synthetic fuels.
It would not surprise me if they were  
thinking pretty seriously about this.
Just to spell out for the audience,  
China has all this electricity production.
And the bottleneck is that only a third  
of final energy use in a modern 
economy comes from electricity. 
The rest, you need gas and 
whatever to transport things... 
Or coal. They use a lot of coal in China.
Right. What Casey is inventing is a technology  
to turn that electricity, which only can 
supply a third of end-uses right now,  
into synthetic fuels which can supply 100% 
of the electricity your civilization needs. 
China's energy advantage 
then becomes overwhelming. 
This technology levels the playing field.
It levels the playing field a lot. 
But at the end of the day, China still contains 
the poorest Chinese people anywhere on earth. 
Never underestimate the capacity for an autocratic 
dictatorship to shoot itself in the foot. 
I don't know. I agree that they've obviously made 
bad decisions, but even if you have the poorest  
Chinese people anywhere in the world, they can 
still be quite rich. Like Singapore is richer,  
whatever. Also, there are parts of China which 
actually contain quite rich Chinese people. 
You have to compare not all of China 
against the US, but Shanghai and  
Guangdong against the United States.
You can have a part of China that is  
as big as America and as wealthy as 
America and as innovative as America. 
Like the Indian middle class is 
larger than the US middle class. 
But also it's nowhere near as wealthy.
Whereas there are parts of China which  
are humongous, which are actually 
as wealthy as the United States,  
and in many cases as innovative, etc.
Yeah. I'm saying don't underestimate it, but  
at the same time, we want to find the truth here.
The truth is we should not count the United States  
out of the battle and just give up.
We're very much still in the race now,  
provided we don't take extra effort 
to shoot ourselves in the foot. 
Right now we are export controlling 
chips for the purpose of keeping our  
AI lead and we recognize this is a key 
input in our ability to compete in AI. 
So we are going to export control 
China's ability to have these chips. 
Energy is also a key input in this AI race, 
and if China wanted to do the converse of  
what we're doing to them with these cheap 
imports, what they would do to us is to  
export control solar and batteries.
It would be asymmetrical, it would  
hurt them worse than us.
If they did tariffs? 
China obviously depends upon the US 
export market for its economic dynamism. 
It's going to hurt both parties to sever the link.
But if you sever the link completely,  
China's ability to make advanced chips 
right now is basically not there,  
whereas the United States can make them.
The United States’ ability to make solar  
arrays is embryonic, but it's actually not that 
far behind China's. It's maybe five years behind. 
If we decided we want to produce 100 
gigawatts of solar capacity every single year… 
We’re already on track to do that.
Is it going to be as cheap as it  
is to do in China?
My views on this are  
somewhat different from the mainstream, 
which is great because this is a podcast. 
The mainstream view would say China has 
cheaper labor, which is no longer true,  
because they compare to Mexico.
And it's got lower environmental  
regulations, which is true.
And that it is more business  
friendly, which is absolutely crazy.
There's no way you could justify that  
your company having to have an inspector from the 
CCP on its board who harasses you about Xi Jinping  
every day helps you do your business.
And also the rule of law is not great. 
So you're constantly having to pay bribes 
to people in order to stay in business. 
The idea that the United States cannot compete 
against that with mostly or fully automated solar  
panel manufacturing in the United States—which 
has cheaper natural gas by far, abundant oil,  
abundant human resources, great financial 
capacity, world leading automation, etc.—is crazy. 
We could literally copy paste 
solar manufacturing factories. 
How much additional solar power capacity 
do you think we could be putting on,  
that's manufactured in the US, by 2028?
This is a good question. When Russia  
invaded Ukraine, I thought, finally the Europeans 
will see sense and they'll pull the trigger on,  
"We need to localize production of solar panels 
from dirt to the finished module," which is  
roughly a four-stage process. They didn't. 
They're still paying Russia a billion dollars  
a day for the privilege of being invaded.
But at the time I thought they could  
probably do that in about two years.
I think the United States could probably  
do that in two years or less if you started 
today. It's currently 11 o'clock. So we're  
going to start cutting checks by noon.
You could ramp up pretty quickly. 
A lot of technology already exists here.
It's not like it has to be invented from scratch. 
It's mostly a case of putting in a phone call to 
all the different manufacturers here, in Germany,  
and so on and saying, "We need you to 10x the size 
of your factory, starting today, blank check, go." 
A lot of your predictions seem to 
be not predictions, but more like,  
"If we had World War II-levels of motivation, if 
we had Manhattan Project-level intensity around  
doing a specific thing, how fast could we do it?
Like if Elon was running the government,  
how fast could it happen?"
He was for a brief period. 
Maybe then we should put it like, "If Elon 
ran the government like he ran SpaceX." 
As opposed to the question of "What is 
actually practically likely to happen,  
given that we are not treating it 
with World War II-level intensity." 
If you look at xAI, which 
Elon is involved in obviously,  
what are they actually focused on right now?
They're focused on the chips because they  
understand the key bottleneck is 
the chips, not the solar power. 
Even if Trump puts in a 200% tariff on Chinese 
solar and we're not able to bypass it via Vietnam  
or something, it's still a bargain. It doesn't 
matter. If you need solar to run your data center,  
it doesn't hurt in terms of the overall 
cost picture. It doesn't matter at all.  
What matters is having the chips at competitive 
capabilities per chip, and enough of them  
installed in your PCBs, in your data centers, 
hooked up to your liquid cooling, ready to go. 
That's actually something that Elon 
and his companies are great at. 
It's figuring out this mass production, 
semi-automated mass production. 
They've got this facility in Texas which is making 
the Starlink receivers, completely automated. 
At what point does, "Oh, we don't have a solar 
panel factory," become on the critical path? 
I very much doubt it's ever 
going to be on the critical path. 
There's dozens and dozens of manufacturers 
of solar panels worldwide that are all  
competing against each other.
So you're a big solar bull. 
Yeah.
Right now the hyperscalers are making decisions  
about the data centers that they're building.
They're going to be 1-2 gigawatts,  
5 gigawatts in Meta's case.
They’re making decisions about how  
they're going to be actually powered.
The people with actual money on  
the line are choosing natural gas.
It's not like they can't see the learning rate. 
They're building things which 
will be online in 2028 or 2030. 
Why are they wrong and you're right?
It's their job. They probably know  
more about it than I do.
But in all seriousness,  
if you're like xAI right now trying to build 
the Colossus data center in downtown Memphis,  
you want to get it done super fast.
"What are all the different things we need? 
What are the factors of production to build this? 
We need a building. We don't have time to build  
a building so we'll buy a building. Okay. We'll 
adapt it. We need power, we need thermal cooling." 
That stuff you can deliver on a truck 
so that's what they did. You need access  
to gas. They had access to gas there.
They could tap into a local gas line. 
If you can tap into a gas line, generally 
speaking, you can get enough power. 
The energy transmission capacity of your 
regular gas delivery pipelines is way,  
way higher than electricity overhead 
lines, and it's easy to upgrade. 
So if you're in this situation right 
now, you say, "Are we constrained by  
our ability to go and rent gas turbines?"
No, they're not, because there was enough  
available once, maybe twice.
But at a certain point,  
you realize as you grow, you start to 
touch all these additional constraints. 
Some of those constraints 
include gas availability. 
So there's a lot of chat about doing 
this in Pennsylvania where there's quite  
a lot of stranded gas, and in parts of Texas.
But at the same time, the United States is gearing  
up in its ability to export natural gas overseas, 
so the price will not be infinitely low forever. 
You start to run into constraints around turbine 
manufacturing rate, around transformer production  
rate, around grid capacity, and also running 
into problems where the AIs and the humans  
who depend on legacy electricity production and 
delivery utilities are competing with each other. 
We just saw this recent forward auction in PJM 
result in very high, unsustainably high prices for  
consumers who depend on cheap electricity to heat 
and cool their houses and have general prosperity. 
If you look far enough in the future, you 
can just turn up the dial arbitrarily high. 
You can say we're going to 
put in a gigawatt a year. 
Well, we can meet that 
constraint with gas turbines. 
We're not going to run out of natural 
gas at 1 gigawatt per year indefinitely. 
What if we're doing 5 gigawatts per year?
What if we're doing 50 gigawatts per year? 
What if we're doing 100 gigawatts per year?
You can just break the situation. 
Not to reach prematurely for analogies, but 
Henry Kaiser set up the shipyard in Richmond,  
just down the road here in 
San Francisco near Berkeley. 
He was initially making ships for the British 
and by the end of the war he had four separate  
shipyards operating in parallel, to the point 
where he was bottlenecked on his supply of steel. 
Steel was rare enough in the war, because 
everyone was using it for different things,  
that Kaiser Industries went off and built 
not only a steel mill, but also a steel mine. 
They went and started digging rocks 
out of the ground to turn into ships. 
That's the same sort of situation you have here 
where you have these massive industrial verticals. 
Here I'm quite bullish on xAI in particular 
because the Elon cinematic universe has just  
done so much industrial stuff compared 
to the Googles and Metas of this world. 
They can reach all the way through down into 
primary material supply if they need to. 
The reason that these current plans are being done 
based on natural gas is that this is the sort of… 
PJM has all kinds of different sources of power.
They have nuclear as well, they have gas,  
they have coal, all kinds of stuff.
This price here is probably driven  
more by the delivery cost growth than by the 
generation cost growth, if that makes sense. 
When you pay your utility bill, the cost 
is sometimes broken down into a delivery  
cost and a generation cost, sometimes 
importation costs and other things. 
The delivery cost is what it costs the utility 
to build and maintain all the power lines that  
connect all the houses to all the power plants in 
some gigantic area divided by your marginal usage,  
with all kinds of other complicated 
rules designed to make it fairer. 
The problem that we see—and the reason 
that PG&E here in California, for example,  
is perpetually on the brink of bankruptcy—is that 
even though the cost of an additional solar panel  
or additional wind turbine or additional gas 
turbine or whatever is relatively cheap, getting  
that power to your house is really expensive. 
Why? Because you've got generally unionized labor  
that has to build and maintain power lines in 
areas that already have built up infrastructure. 
You have multiple collisions, whether 
this is a power pole on your own street  
or building a new transmission line which 
requires you to eminent domain land. 
So you're in court for years and years and 
years spending public money litigating against  
other people who are also spending public 
money to litigate against you on behalf  
of other interest groups and so on and so 
forth. Then you've got wildfires. It's just  
the poster child for Baumol cost disease.
One of the reasons that we're going to see  
large-scale pruning of these grids is that we 
just can't afford under our current regulatory  
regime to maintain.
When you say pruning,  
will everything just go off-grid?
It's fairly clear to me that for  
really large captive loads, like AI data 
centers or aluminum refineries or whatever,  
you're going to have to build your own power 
plant for them, which is how it used to work. 
If you had an aluminum plant 
back in the day, you would be  
building your own power plant for it as well.
It seems inefficient to have redundant power  
plants at every single industrial site.
Let me paint a grand vision for you. 
It would seem inefficient, but if you are 
sensitive to the cost of power expressed  
in supply elasticity or something 
like that, you just have to do it. 
There's no two ways about it.
Is it inefficient for the xAI Colossus  
data center to have its own captive power plant, 
which it does on the backs of a bunch of trucks  
in the parking lot? No, it's not inefficient. 
It's the cheapest way for them to get power. 
Okay, AI might be a special case. But big 
picture question. Across different kinds of ISOs,  
from Texas to Pennsylvania to whatever, 
people are building data centers which  
will not be online for many years. They're 
choosing natural gas. What's going on? 
We haven't completely exhausted the 
supply of turbines relative to GPUs. 
Do you have some estimate of 
when we'll run out of them? 
Because we can also make more.
Everything before about 2030  
is spoken for at this point.
Yeah, you could make more turbines. 
The funny thing is that it's actually relatively 
expensive to spool up additional production  
of these turbines.
Here's one thing  
you have to grapple with sooner or later.
Conventional power generation is a steam engine. 
You have some kind of chemical 
that you find inside the earth  
that is out of chemical equilibrium with the 
atmosphere and you burn it and it makes heat. 
It could be coal, could be gas, oil.
You're giving me the true birds and bees here. 
Yeah, exactly. And it makes 
heat and you boil water. 
The water goes through some kind of 
mechanical contrivance that creates motion. 
That motion twists a magnet and generates an 
electrical field which then pushes electrons  
down wires, which then push electrons through a 
series of gates that then approximate thinking.  
It's kind of complicated. But the key 
step in this is converting heat into  
electricity in the most efficient way.
The most common way is the same for a  
nuclear plant or a gas plant, combined 
cycle plant or a coal plant or whatever. 
It’s what's called a Brayton cycle.
The jet engine on an aircraft  
is a Brayton cycle as well.
Anytime you have a Brayton cycle  
with a bunch of Inconel spinning at high speed, 
it's just going to cost you a bunch of money. 
Because it's inherently inefficient or what?
It's just inherently expensive to build. 
Okay. What is the cost of… GE makes 
these 100 megawatt gas turbines, right? 
I don't actually know what the retail price is.
I would suspect that if their price is flexible,  
it would have gone up a lot.
But if I recall correctly, $35 a megawatt  
hour is just the flag-four cost for..
How much, sorry? 
$35 a megawatt hour just for the Brayton cycle.
We're not talking about the fuel,  
we're not talking about the heat 
exchanges, we're not talking about  
the cooling ponds or anything like that.
Just the amortized cost of the high-speed,  
high-temperature spinning 
components is $35 a megawatt hour. 
Do you think the hyperscalers are being 
irrational, or do they have some reason? 
To be clear, they don't care about the cost 
of power. This is very counterintuitive. For  
Grandma Kettle in Pennsylvania, she's 
very sensitive to electricity costs. 
We don't really want her to suffer in her 
retirement from unaffordable electricity  
costs and having to sit there shivering.
That's not the image that we want. 
At the same time, what is the economic value to 
you of using Claude or Grok or whatever you use  
on a monthly basis?
A lot. 
It's obviously much more than the 
subscription, but is it 10 times more  
than the subscription maybe?
Yeah, easily. 
Let's say the subscription is on the order of $10.
The value is on the order of $100. 
No, it’s probably more like $100 and $1,000.
How much does it cost xAI or Anthropic  
or whatever to serve your usage?
The marginal variable cost of serving it,  
in electricity, is less than 
10% of the actual cost of… 
Well, their cost of serving it is maybe a buck 
per million tokens or something like that. 
The cost of electricity is about 10% of that.
So 10 cents of electricity is generating  
$1,000 worth of economic value.
It's very obvious that Anthropic  
could be like, "Our electricity cost 
basis has increased by a factor of 100." 
Now instead of paying 10 cents on your bill, 
on your $100 bill for power you're paying $10. 
So we're putting your subscription up to 
$110 for an electricity capacity charge. 
Then they could go out and buy turbines 
for prices that would make your eyes water. 
Okay, so then why are we 
going to get the solar future? 
In 2032, we're going to have hundreds 
of gigawatts of extra demand for data  
centers and at that point, most of 
it is coming from solar? Why is that? 
There aren't enough turbines being manufactured.
But also, I think in the early 2000s… We can  
probably overlay the graph of how many 
turbines were being manufactured. Right  
now, we're at historical—
They've ramped up basically  
to the early 2000s rate again.
But I don’t know, you have to make  
more solar panels as well, right?
There will be supply elasticities  
for both solar and natural gas.
Is there some reason to think that it's  
worse for the supply chain involved in having a 
natural gas-powered data center than a solar one? 
Yeah I do. The learning rate for natural 
gas is nowhere near as steep as solar. 
It just tells you that it's easy to make solar 
panels, much easier to make solar panels. 
There are very few manufactured 
products which are easier to make. 
The Wright's Law coefficient is 43%.
So every time we double cumulative production,  
we get a 43% reduction in cost.
What is the basis of that? 
Why are we finding 43% worth of things that can be 
made cheaper or more efficient every single year? 
Roughly speaking, there's 10,000 manufacturing 
process engineers working on this full-time. 
That could be true of any process, 
but no other process sees the kinds of  
learning rates that solar is seeing.
That’s not strictly true. In order  
to sustain this over a long period of 
time, you obviously need to have demand  
elasticity that exceeds your learning rate.
Otherwise, you would, after a couple of OOMs,  
saturate your market at the current price 
and you'd have no additional growth. 
But in this case, roughly every two 
years we're doubling production. 
Every 2-2.5 years, we’re doubling production and 
the price is coming down by a factor of ~40%. 
So it’s roughly 15-20% per year.
Then just as a result of that price  
reduction, demand skyrockets by probably 
six times more than that additional marginal  
production capacity increase.
This is one point where I'll say  
the so-called pros are definitely wrong.
Conventional wisdom is that solar demand  
is going to saturate this week. It's 
going to saturate. We've got a graph  
here somewhere that's like, "This year 
is it, it's never going to grow anymore." 
Instead, it's just blasting out the top of the 
graph. This conventional wisdom is wrong. Not  
only are solar adoption, production, and price 
decreases continuing, they're accelerating. 
And the rate at which they're 
accelerating is still accelerating. 
The rate at which it's 
accelerating is accelerating? 
Yes.
As measured in the total  
fraction of energy that’s coming from solar?
In the sense that its fitness for the markets  
that it is being produced for is increasing 
over time. So it's still extremely early.  
We’re still in the Apple II computer era of solar.
Backing up, if the story is that the reason solar  
is getting cheaper is because there's a lot of 
demand for more solar, and that demand can sustain  
economies of scale or whatever is going on…
Yes. I'm going to go on a limb here  
and agree with Elon Musk on this.
Then shouldn't that also be true of gas turbines  
and transformers and power stations and whatever 
else that's required for the non-solar future? 
We're expecting AI to drive up demand 
for power regardless of the source. 
To the extent the story for solar becoming cheaper 
over time is just that demand will go up and that  
will drive efficiencies, why isn't that true for…?
Let's say you're a bank, and you're trying to  
decide whether to lend GE a bunch of money 
to expand production of their gas turbines. 
You can write them the check today.
They'll start scaling up their factories. 
They'll start to see the benefits of 
that in three or four or five years. 
You don't know if the AI 
bubble will have burst by then. 
You don't know if China will 
have invaded Taiwan by then. 
You don't know if Siemens or Philips 
or someone will have outcompeted you. 
You don't know if GE's major looming 
structural problems will cause it to be  
unable to compete, as it has in the past.
In order to make that money back,  
you also have to then operate that 
plant at that capacity for 20 years. 
If I was looking at the same charts as 
they're looking at right now, I'd say,  
"What are the odds that in 25 years' 
time we can produce gas turbines at  
a price that is relevant in a world where 
solar is already at its current price and  
batteries are at the price where 
they're already?" You cannot win. 
I feel like there was actually 
a similar discussion a year back  
when AI people were like, "No, AI is real. This 
is going to happen." Then SK Hynix, Samsung,  
etc., were like, "We're not ramping up HBM 
production because HBM is used largely for  
AI workloads, and if this demand doesn't 
continue, then our additional manufacturing  
capacity for HBM will not have been worth it."
Then there was another bottleneck with CoWoS. 
What happened after that? Did they end 
up indeed ramping up their production? 
I think so.
Well, so when someone says,  
"We can't do it, we won't do it, no way, no how," 
what they're saying is, "Write me a check." And  
they did. Now Samsung's coming on board in 
the States to build AI6 with xAI, I think. 
So they all got there in the end.
Maybe it’s worth going into the numbers. 
Right now, 43% of US data center 
power consumption is from natural gas. 
Basically, you think asymptotically that 
it will be 100% solar if you go to 2040? 
Yeah. Obviously legacy production, coal 
and stuff, is going to retire over time. 
If a gas plant is still making 
money, people will keep operating it. 
But at a certain point… It is the case right 
now that operating a coal plant costs more  
than building a new solar plant.
So it's just cheaper to turn off. 
Also, capacity is going to increase a lot so 
that helps to dilute the existing production. 
And the amount of use is 
going to increase a bunch. 
The amount of data center use of energy 
will just be exponentially higher. 
So the new stock matters a lot as 
compared to the existing stock. 
Anyway, I want to know in 2027, 
what fraction is natural gas? 
In 2030, what fraction is 
natural gas versus solar? 
For new load?
Let's say new load. For new load, 2035,  
etc. If eventually you're right that we'll pave 
the earth in solar panels to sustain quadrillions  
of AI souls, what is the pace of that?
The question to ask is,  
what is the major constraint on that ramp up?
Then everything else will just draft in behind. 
I suspect that the hardest thing to make 
will always be the silicon, like the GPUs. 
So the question is really, "How quickly 
does TSMC ramp up its production of GPUs?" 
That's a question for you, not for me.
I'll use some numbers that AI  
2027 used for their compute forecast.
Even if you don't buy their singularity thing,  
I think they did a reasonably good job with 
crunching the numbers on their compute forecast. 
I think they said there's on the order of 10 
million H100 equivalents in the world today. 
I think they said by 2028 there'd 
be 100 million, so basically  
10x more H100 equivalents in the world.
About a kilowatt each, something like that. 
Okay, so that's like 100 gigawatts. That sounds 
roughly right. You're not the first person to  
give me a call and ask me about this. I'll 
put it that way. I'm not going to name names. 
Pretty much all the names you've heard of 
have given me a call and said, "We know  
that you're a minority voice on the paper that 
came out recently with Scale Microgrids talking  
about how you could do 90% solar, 10% gas."
I said, "You can go all the way 100% solar." 
I wrote a blog post about it.
So they always call me up and say,  
"What about this?"
They're all talking  
like 5 gigawatts in the next few years.
That's just like 90+% solar for just those. 
So within a few years, we'll probably see that 
the majority of new data centers that are going  
in will be mostly solar.
Within how long? 
Let's say by 2027, the majority of new 
data centers going in at that point would  
be mostly solar.
Going in as in…? 
Groundbreaking at that point.
But if you're groundbreaking in 2027,  
you're probably planning it now, right?
That's why they're calling me. My  
consulting fees are extremely affordable.
But I don't have deep visibility—because I'm  
not in the same room with the Meta people—as to 
when we're going to hit the wall on transformers  
and when we're going to hit the wall on just how 
much municipal peak load we can shave off, which  
is the latest thing that's been doing the rounds.
It turns out there's a handful of places in the  
United States—and by handful, I 
mean literally a handful—where  
there might have used to be an aluminum smelter.
There's a bunch of latent capacity in the grid. 
And there's also a bunch of generators on 
the grid that are notionally turned down. 
They operate at, say, 40-50% capacity factor, but 
they max out at about 80% capacity factor because  
you've got to bring them down for maintenance 
pretty often, especially if they're old. 
So they're saying, "Well, you know, we 
could pay you just to operate this old  
coal plant or something at higher capacity.
It'll go down this power line to this place  
where the smelter used to be.
We'll set up there, and then we  
promise to curtail when you need the power."
That basically means they just have a massive  
captive battery plant as well.
Which is fine, you just buy  
that and it arrives on a truck.
The major advantage to doing that  
over the pure solar play is that the power 
is already there, so there's no risk there. 
And you don't need a massive amount of land.
The problem with the solar approach is that  
there's no two ways about it. It's a farming 
operation. You need a huge amount of land. 
The total amount of land that you're using, 
less than 1% is under batteries, under roads,  
under data center structures, et 
cetera, etc. It's mostly solar. 
Let's get into what this looks like.
If you've got a 5-gigawatt plant you want to  
build, break down the numbers for me in how much 
land in terms of solar you need to farm this out. 
I was talking to somebody in this 
space and they said, "Obviously,  
the cost of energy for these data centers 
is a small fraction of the total cost. 
Most of the cost is going towards chips.
So then the issue is just,  
can you make the energy available?"
They were saying that even though  
solar panels themselves you can acquire, the 
issue is getting that much contiguous land and  
getting the permitting to interconnect 
it. That’s apparently a big hassle. 
It's kind of a nightmare.
So they're like, "Well,  
at that point, is it actually easier 
than just getting on the grid or…?" 
Anyway, if you need tens of thousands of 
acres of solar, where can you do that? 
Basically in Texas. There's this very popular 
misconception that there's not enough land to  
do solar. This is garbage. If you've ever flown in 
an aircraft in the United States and you've ever  
looked out the window, you'd be like, "Oh, wow, 
look, there's a lot of land you could put solar  
on." Especially west of like 110°.
Does it need to be flat, or no? 
No. Doesn't matter. Do trees grow on mountain 
slopes? So it doesn't matter. For reference,  
Nevada is something like 80 million acres.
Just Nevada, which is like 90% federal land,  
is 80 million acres.
I would never say that we  
should sacrifice Nevada to the AI and pave the 
entirety of Nevada from one wall to the other. 
But I just saw a bunch of things in my 
feed the last couple of days that Vegas  
is falling apart. The boomers are retiring. No 
one goes there anymore. People would go to see  
the 100 million acres of solar.
Even if you did it in Nevada— 
We can do it anywhere. You can do 
it anywhere you can find the land. 
People say that you can't do this in 
Europe because Europe doesn't have  
solar power. Europe has solar power. 
I've been to Europe in the summer. 
It's sunny for 20 hours of the day. It's 
a bit seasonal. But that's not a big deal. 
But I mean it is. Because energy is a small 
fraction of the cost, you care more about making  
sure the chips are running all the time, right?
In practice, what happens is… Let's say Europe  
hypothetically awakens from its slumber and 
decides it wants to participate in AI. I hope  
it does. They say, "Well, we're going to 
have to put 100 gigawatts of solar down at  
some point to build these data centers.
It will most likely be in southern Europe. 
Spain is not particularly heavily populated.
That's a great place to start. 
So we put in 100 gigawatts of 
solar data centers in Spain." 
Basically, if you're spending AI 
hyperscaling money on your GPUs,  
you want to have four nines of uptime in order 
to maximize your tokens per dollar spent on the  
entire project, not just on that.
This is a very subtle point. 
I can go into vast detail on it later on maybe.
Let's just say you need four nines of uptime. 
In order to achieve four nines of 
uptime in the middle of winter,  
you need to have a lot of solar overbuilt.
Is solar overbuilt a bad thing? No. Is the  
fact that we produce 40% more food than we 
need a bad thing? No. It's much better than  
producing 40% less than we need.
It just means that effectively,  
you have a giant captive power plant attached 
to a data center that 99.9% of the time produces  
more power than it needs. 99% of the time 
it produces much more power than it needs. 
That can now actually be the source of power for 
the local utility, which, instead of being like,  
"Naughty, naughty data center, you must 
disconnect when we tell you to", they say,  
"Hey, data center, I noticed you've got a bunch 
of power you're not using 360 days of the year. 
Would you mind ever so much if we threw a power 
cable over the wall and we powered our entire town  
off your spare power at essentially zero marginal 
cost, plus whatever residential batteries that we  
need in addition to local power supply."
Brian Potter had a good analogy in  
his blog post about this.
He's like, "My MacBook has a  
terabyte of storage and I use 100 gigabytes.
I just got the terabyte version because it's  
cheap enough and I might need it 
at some point that it's worth it." 
You're saying solar gets so cheap that 
it's the way we'll treat hard drive space. 
We get a bunch of excess.
Also the market will be made  
at the new marginal consumption and production.
All the people who are working in the space right  
now are like, "Oh, I'm in the business 
of delivering power or storing power. 
I'm going to serve the AI market because 
that's where all the growth is occurring." 
That's where all of US GDP 
growth is occurring right now. 
I guess you didn’t answer the question of , yes, 
theoretically we could do this, but is it going  
to be possible to get the permitting to have 
tens of thousands of acres of contiguous land? 
It doesn't need to be contiguous. It helps if 
it's contiguous. It doesn't need to be convex. 
You can have a bit over here and a bit over there 
and you can wire them together relatively easily. 
In fact, in the limit, you have fields 
upon fields of solar arrays with… 
Tell me your dream, Casey.
Fields, just solar  
arrays as far as the eye can see.
Then within the solar arrays, roughly in the  
middle of them, you have your batteries and your…
I've played Factorio. I remember this optimal  
layout of batteries and solar.
You’ve got your batteries  
and you've got your data centers.
So in terms of ground floor area, it's roughly,  
10% racks, 10% access to the racks, maybe 50% 
batteries stacked up on top of each other,  
and there’s also cooling, something like that.
That’s in terms of what sits in the  
centralized node.
That could be 100  
megawatts or it could be 10 gigawatts, 
depending on how you want to scale this. 
But then all you need to connect 
that to the outside world is an  
optical fiber cable which you can string 
up on poles, you can run it underground. 
You could even use microwave 
links if you really wanted to. 
You could use Starlink if you really wanted to.
I don't know if Starlink would be fast enough. 
I'm not sure if it's capacity is high enough.
You could use laser links if you really needed  
to. That's it. It's this completely 
self-contained world of computation. 
Because it's off-grid.
Yeah it occurs off-grid,  
on private land somewhere in the backwoods of 
Texas where no one lives and no one will ever live  
because it's completely inhospitable to humans.
In terms of the ratios, one trend that was  
impressed upon me is that the power 
density of racks is increasing a  
lot as the flops per GPU are increasing.
A megawatt per rack is what they're heading  
to now, which just seems bananas to me.
I think it was even more than that. 
Let's get concrete here for a second.
Let's say you’ve got one rack and it's 1 megawatt. 
I'll leave the cooling to someone 
who specializes in air conditioners,  
but it's basically throwing air conditioners 
at the problem. Then you have batteries. So in  
order to get four nines of uptime on this… In 
South Texas, you actually need less than this. 
But let's just say it’s 24 
hours worth of battery storage. 
That means it'll get you through 
two bad nights in a row, basically. 
Actually, it turns out that you can 
significantly decrease power consumption  
with a very small reduction in overall compute.
So if you've got like three really bad days in a  
row or something, you can dial back 
your power usage quite a lot without  
compromising your inference or training.
Okay, so you've got, say, a Tesla Megapack,  
something like four megawatt hours.
So one megawatt rack, and then six  
Tesla Megapacks, each of which is 
roughly one truckload worth of stuff. 
So one truckload worth of rack, and then 
like six truckloads worth of batteries. 
Then in order to operate this at an average 
power of 1 megawatt, your solar arrays in  
Texas will be something like 25% utilization.
So on average, if the sun came up every day  
and the day was the same length all the time, 
you would need 4 megawatts of solar arrays,  
which is about 4 acres of land.
But in practice, because you're  
aiming for four nines instead of one 
nine, you need an overbuild of about 2.5x. 
So you've got about 10 acres of solar.
So 10 acres of solar, six truckloads of  
batteries, one truckload of data 
center, and some cooling stuff. 
For how big of a data center?
One megawatt. That's just for one  
megawatt. So 10 acres, one megawatt 
kind of situation at four nines. 
If you want five gigawatts, then that's 5,000 
times 10. So 50,000 acres. At a larger scale,  
you can probably cut all those numbers 
down by 10-20%, but it’s on that order. 
And 50,000 acres sounds like a lot.
It does sound like a lot, is it not? 
The amount of land put aside 
for Oak Ridge was 100,000 acres. 
The amount of land put aside for 
Hanford was about 100,000 acres. 
What's Hanford?
Hanford was where they made  
the plutonium in the Manhattan Project.
But I don't know how big that was. 
Is it like, "Oh, this is so small," and then 
you're like, "Oh, but it's 100,000 acres," or…? 
It's still largely unpopulated now 
because it's a National Laboratory. 
The reason they did that was they 
thought, "Oh, we're going to need  
four piles to produce plutonium."
These are not nuclear reactors that  
produce exothermal energy, so you can't 
actually make nuclear power with them,  
but you're making plutonium with them.
In the end, they only needed two. 
They wanted them spaced out because they thought 
they might just spontaneously explode, and a bunch  
of other facilities and plants and stuff as well.
Austin Vernon had an interesting blog post where  
he said that if you have diesel generators 
or something which can take over 10% of  
the generation during winter, then you 
can have a 60% reduction in the amount  
of solar panels you need to install because 
you don't need to plan for that contingency. 
Yeah, there's a balance here. This is not 
a very complicated optimization problem. 
For people who do optimization problems 
for fun, this is how you do it. 
You start off with a bunch of NREL data 
on what your solar abundance is in this  
particular part of the world, and then you just 
start throwing solar panels and batteries at  
it over the course of a one-year simulation 
until you hit the number of nines you want. 
To an extent, you can trade the amount of panels 
and the amount of batteries you've got back and  
forth, and there's a very broad optimum.
Or you can throw in a third thing  
like a diesel backup or a gas turbine.
The issue here is—if Meta or Microsoft or whoever  
just wants to get something off the ground—this 
might be low opex to have this huge solar farm,  
but it's high capex, where you need to hire 30,000 
people to go in the middle of a desert and install  
50,000 acres' worth of solar panels.
They're like, "Why would I not just  
buy 50 gas turbines instead?"
Why not just outbid Microsoft,  
or Meta outbids Google or something, for the last 
gas turbine that's available that year? Totally.  
The thing that Meta has realized is that Zuck is 
running out of time to spend his money to win. 
The capex is not crazy high, just to be clear.
The capex is still dominated by just the GPUs. 
How much does five gigawatts' worth of GPUs cost?
I don’t know if my numbers will be  
wrong but $250 billion or something?
$250 billion sounds about right. Is 50,000  
acres going to cost $250 billion in Texas?
That's so much money. Wait, I did the  
math in my head and like, that’s a lot of money.
We're talking maybe hundreds of millions  
of dollars, something like that.
So it's like 0.1% of the cost is land. 
How much does a megawatt of solar cost?
If you go and ask the usual suspects,  
they'll tell you a million dollars.
But this is one of the things that breaks  
my brain at Terraform, which is my day job.
The modules themselves, without tariffs,  
would be 8 cents a watt, so that's $80,000…
8 cents a watt? But they're like a dollar a watt,  
including installation and everything.
Including installation and everything.  
But the panels are the magic part.
They're the thing that turns sunlight  
into pure electrical energy at 25% efficiency.
Everything else should be less than that. 
If you want to work on that project, 
come and work with us at Terraform  
because we're very cost-sensitive.
We'll give you an opportunity to  
shill, don't worry.
In all seriousness,  
the central takeaway is that the hyperscalers 
are not power cost sensitive. They are power  
availability sensitive. For all these things, you 
just run into this supply elasticity wall at the  
rates of increase that we're talking about.
Solar is by far the best option for  
firehosing energy at a given problem 
because it rains down from the sky. 
Between the fact that maybe solar prices will go 
down and the fact that demand is going to go up. 
Do you think electricity 
prices are likely to rise? 
Yes, but electricity prices at this point are 
a reflection of a regulatory irrationality. 
This is the same situation in Europe 
and Australia for that matter. 
Your prices will rise until you've had enough 
and you say, "No, we demand that you allow  
us to take advantage of power technology 
that's been invented in the last 50 years." 
In terms of things that are causing us to 
lose to China, tariffs are neither here  
nor there because as we've discussed, 
we're not sensitive to cost on power. 
But the environmental regulations that 
are actively preventing us from deploying  
renewable energy in the United States… 
This is the reason Texas is winning. 
Texas is out deploying California 10 to 1.
The regulatory environment around solar is just  
insane. It's insane. In the United States, part 
of the reason that solar has not been deployed  
at massive scale yet is that a bunch of laws 
went into action in the early 1970s that were  
intended to protect our environment.
And that makes a lot of sense. 
And our environment's a great 
thing we should protect. 
I think people will be familiar 
with NEPA and whatever,  
but how is it especially impacting solar?
Let's say you've got a bunch of private  
land out in the middle of nowhere, 
and you want to build solar on it. 
You'll probably end up triggering NEPA, 
at which point you now have to do what  
is not in the law but considered 
necessary under current regulations. 
That’s your four-year environmental impact 
review, which generates so much paper that  
just the environmental impact of producing the 
report—because you have to cut down trees to make  
paper—is more than the environmental impact of 
just deploying the solar. This is bonkers. It is  
crazy town. The thing that drives me particularly 
crazy in Southern California is that just because  
solar is kind of new, and off-grid solar is very 
new, unless you're very, very careful you end up  
getting regulated as though you're trying to build 
a chemical plant even though it's a solar array. 
The impact of solar arrays on desert is 
arguably positive because it shades the  
ground and improves soil moisture retention.
If you wanted to reverse desertification,  
you would basically just deploy solar panels 
on it and that would pay for the process. 
But you end up having to go through more stringent 
environmental review process than if you just  
wanted to grade the whole thing and cover it 
in concrete, or if you grade it and then park  
a bunch of old rusting cars that are dropping 
oil into the aquifer, which in many cases you  
don't need a permit for at all.
But to build solar, you have to  
go through this whole process.
If there's one thing that anyone  
listening to this can do, it would be to have 
a categorical exemption for solar deployment. 
Or if I put money in an escrow account that says 
after 20 years we have to pull this out—we'll pull  
all the solar out of the desert and it goes back 
to being desert—I will do that in a heartbeat. 
But if I have to hire another biologist 
for $10,000 to be like, "Well, on that  
40-acre plot we found a tuft of grass which we 
believe might be one of the 20 species that this  
particular species of bee sometimes eats, 
and this species of bee is not technically  
endangered but it might be at some point in 
the future… Therefore, you can't deploy there." 
Even though it's zoned unrestricted industrial 
and it's sandwiched between a rocket test stand  
and a chemical plant, for example, in 
an industrial part of the desert… I'm  
going to become the Joker. It is insane. 
We need to be a bit balanced about this. 
I don't want to drive species into extinction.
But the meta problem here is if we don't  
move our industrial stack off fossil 
fuels in 10 or 20 years… First of all,  
we'll get poor the same way the UK did, 
because they ran out of coal, basically. 
The second thing is we'll get poor 
because we'll flood our coastal cities  
than Florida underneath climate change.
We need solar synthetics for that part. 
We also need to do sulfur injection 
and a couple of other things. 
People will point out that transmission line 
growth has been stuck in a rut for decades. 
We have all these bottlenecks in terms 
of substations and transformers, etc. 
Why will this not hamper 
this abundant solar future? 
That's a really great question. You and 
I had a conversation along these lines  
almost two years ago when we first met.
It caused me to go and write a blog post. 
This is a good way of thinking about it.
There's another blog post you wrote,  
which was also related to a conversation 
we had, which is "How to feed the AIs." 
That’s much more recent. That 
was after dinner, I think. 
To be fair, I usually am fairly clear in my 
blog posts if I'm shitposting or if I'm serious,  
but this one actually I'm dead serious on.
It's actually the one where it's the most  
out of the money bet as well.
Everyone else that I consider  
to be a respectable forecaster in this 
area disagrees with me on it. That to  
one side. We know why the grid is expensive.
It's a lot of wires strung up in hard to reach  
places that are hard to maintain, especially as 
the workforce ages, with regulations and all the  
rest and eminent domain and so on and so forth.
So the grid's not going to get cheaper  
anytime soon or easier to build.
If you look at the projections of how much grid  
the DOE would have us needing to build in the next 
10 years versus how much's actually being built,  
it's not even in the same order of magnitude.
You say, "Are we totally screwed?" 
The answer is, "No, we're not totally 
screwed" because batteries actually  
do the same job that the grid does. This 
is kind of weird. Hear me out. The grid  
transports power from one place to another.
It transports almost instantaneously at the  
speed of light, so it's actually 
performing a spatial arbitrage. 
The idea being that right outside the local 
nuclear power plant, power is really cheap  
because they make a lot of it.
And in your house, power is  
really expensive because you don't 
have a power plant in your house. 
You pay the intermediary a small fee 
and they allow this trade to take place. 
That's basically how the grid works.
Until quite recently, the only way we  
had of meaningfully storing energy, storing 
electricity on the grid, was pumped hydro. 
That only works in a handful of 
places and with limited capacity. 
It doesn't work all that well either. 
The efficiency is not great. Now we have  
batteries. Batteries store power at one time of 
day and they release it at another time of day. 
Batteries are performing a temporal 
arbitrage, an arbitrage over time. 
But they can be local or they can be more remote.
I think we'll end up seeing batteries next to the  
solar arrays, and batteries in the middle 
of the grid at substations, and batteries  
on the sites of existing power plants that 
get turned off, and batteries in your house,  
and batteries everywhere in between.
One way of thinking of this is,  
what is your per capita allocation 
of batteries in kilograms per head? 
When you and I were much younger, the lithium 
ion battery was just in your cell phone. 
So let’s say it’s 10 grams 
per person or something. 
Nowadays half the people in this 
town drive Teslas, so your per  
capita allocation of lithium ion batteries 
is 100 kilograms or something like that. 
We're talking four or five OOMs of 
increase of total battery per person. 
That trend is only going to continue.
We've got batteries that are  
performing this temporal arbitrage.
The sun comes up every day, right? 
So the power swings from midday—you're 
otherwise curtailing the solar array—to  
dusk when everyone's watching TV and cooking 
dinner or running the air conditioners to  
cool off in the evening. It’s very predictable. 
Whereas, "Oh, we had really bad weather, so we  
had to use the power line that runs to the extra 
power plants over by Hoover Dam or something." 
It doesn't get used nearly as much.
Its peak utilization happens almost never,  
which means that the utilization of the batteries 
is on average, let's say 300 days a year. 
The utilization of your most expensive, highest 
voltage grid assets is much, much lower. 
That includes the substations and 
transformers and stuff that serve that. 
So it's a really bad position to 
be in if you're a grid operator. 
You've got this aging existing thing 
that the batteries are cannibalizing. 
The batteries are being 
installed behind the meter. 
You don't have a say in whether they're 
being installed and how they're being used. 
All you know is that your utilization of 
your asset where you get to charge top  
dollar for it is just dropping year after 
year at the same time as your operating  
costs are increasing year after year.
So it's just very clear that the average  
distance the electron is going to travel between 
generation and consumption is going to decrease  
in the future pretty radically. It's already 
decreasing. It's going to continue to decrease. 
It's especially helpful for solar, but 
solar is the one that's most intermittent. 
You can predict the amount of solar power you're 
going to get in three days pretty accurately  
because of weather prediction.
But you can't change the  
amount of batteries you have.
Well, actually in the limit you can because  
you can put them on trucks and drive them around.
There could be a capacity market for batteries  
where you drive them around 
to people who need them. 
In practice, it's going to be cheaper just to 
double the size of your battery because batteries  
are going to keep getting cheaper and cheaper.
But what it does mean is you can say, "Well,  
I know that I'm going to have three low days, 
so I will start curtailing now by 5% so I don't  
have to curtail by 50% in three days.
Then overall for the whole year I'll  
only curtail five hours, so I'm still at 
four nines instead of having to curtail 24  
hours because I can't predict the weather."
Okay, let's assume you're right. I think at  
some point, you will be right.
Maybe we disagree about–sorry,  
I'm not qualified to disagree.
Maybe you and some other person  
disagree about what year it happens.
But it's hard to deny that in the asymptote,  
our civilization is headed towards lots of energy 
use for AI and a lot of that coming from solar. 
In that asymptote, I want to 
get to the crazy nerd sci-fi…. 
What does our civilization 
look like? What is happening? 
Kardashev Level 1.
Let's wait to get to  
turning the entire earth into an AI factory.
But let’s say in the 2030s, where you've gotten  
multiple people who are building sites on 
the order of 5 gigawatts or 10 gigawatts. 
The value of the hardware is dependent 
on its complement, which is the software. 
Right now, AI models are fine.
The hardware they're running on,  
the economic value they can generate, is sort 
of bottlenecked by how good the software is. 
But if you actually had AGI, if you had 
human-level intelligence or maybe even better,  
running on an H100, that H100 is worth a lot.
We're paying a lot for humans to do work. 
Right now, I don't think AI is that valuable.
The models themselves aren't super, super valuable  
in terms of just pure economic value.
OpenAI is generating on the order  
of $10-20 billion ARR.
That sucks. It's terrible.  
How can they sleep at night?
But for context, McDonald's and  
Kohl's generate more yearly revenue than that.
But the promise of AGI is to automate human labor. 
Human labor generates on the order 
of $60 trillion of economic value. 
That's how much is paid out in 
wages to labor around the world. 
So that's what AGI can do.
Even if you curtail it to  
just white-collar work, that's still 
tens of trillions of dollars of value. 
So once we have models which are actually 
human-level, they will be worth at least that,  
pending the fact that you can 
build them or you can run them. 
I don’t think we should constrain ourselves 
to being like, "Oh, well, maybe it'll be  
some fraction of current payroll," because 
that's very contingent on humans being humans. 
That's a lower bound, to be clear.
Oh yeah, lower bound for sure. 
But if you think about someone trying to 
estimate the upper bound for the market  
cap of Caterpillar based on, "Well, it takes 
this many men and wheelbarrows to dig a trench. 
So it couldn't be more than that."
One way to think about the industrial  
revolutions is every time you figure 
out the industrial revolution,  
what you're doing is you're finding some way of 
bypassing a constraint or bypassing a bottleneck. 
The bottleneck prior to what we call the 
Industrial Revolution was metabolism. 
How much oats can a human or a horse physically 
digest and then convert into useful mechanical  
output for their peasant overlord or whatever?
Nowadays we would giggle to think that the amount  
of food we produce is meaningful in the context 
of the economic power of a particular country. 
Because 99% of the energy that we 
consume routes around our guts,  
through the gas tanks of our cars and through our 
aircraft and in our grids and stuff like that. 
Right now, the AI revolution is about 
routing around cognitive constraints,  
that in some ways writing, the printing 
press, computers, the Internet have  
already allowed us to do to some extent.
A credit card is a good example of something that  
routes around a cognitive constraint of building 
a network of trust. It's a centralized trust. 
That's interesting. I want to 
credit James Bradbury and Gwern  
with making this interesting point when I 
was talking with them a couple of days ago. 
If you measure it by GDP, AI's 
outputs might be underwhelming. 
One of the complaints that economists 
have about the Internet is that it's  
hard to measure the consumer surplus that's 
created by the Internet because a lot of the  
goods and services that are made 
available, you pay zero for them. 
They don't show up in GDP.
Well, it's the same with oil. 
In the sense that energy’s like only 1% of GDP?
Well, oil is like $8 trillion a year or something,  
right?
Yeah. 
But if you said, "Well, one day we're going to 
consume 100 times more energy in the form of oil  
than in the form of food—and the per joule cost of 
food is whatever it is, the cost of a Big Mac—then  
oil should be like $800 trillion a year.
Per unit energy, oil, like gasoline,  
is 100 times cheaper than the 
cheapest food that humans can digest. 
Does that mean that we've shot ourselves 
in the foot by using oil to run our  
economy because it's so cheap? No.
Right. Also its fraction of GDP  
also doesn't correspond to how important it is.
For example, oil is like 1% of GDP or something. 
But if you don't have oil, then you have these oil 
shocks, which cause double digit decreases in GDP. 
So the elasticity of demand often matters more 
than its raw fraction contribution to GDP. 
Anyways, on the original point about AI, you're 
going to have this huge deflation. Gwern put it  
this way. He's like, "If you imagine Dario's data 
center of geniuses, how is that showing up in GDP? 
Well, it would be the inputs 
which are the chips, the energy,  
etc., and the outputs which are just the tokens.
Neither of those is going to be that astronomical  
in comparison to the value that data 
center of geniuses is producing." 
In terms of GDP numbers, if that data center of 
geniuses automates or complements a bunch of human  
work, it might actually cause a nominal decrease 
in GDP while at the same time contributing  
massively to what we might think of as the 
valuable stuff human civilization can produce. 
In the long run, it might make more sense 
to think of the size of our economy,  
or the size of our civilization, as the 
raw energy use that we do rather than GDP. 
Again, GDP will see this huge deflation because 
the variable cost of running AI will just be  
pretty cheap as compared to paying humans wages.
At the point where you've got a mixed economy with  
an AI doing my job and also a human doing my job…
I love how this is the new way we use  
the phrase "mixed economy".
Obviously, I still have some  
pricing power relative to humans, 
and the AI thus has pricing power. 
But if it were the case that a new kind of 
job emerges that AI is really well adapted to,  
because it's not competing against 
humans for most of those roles,  
it'd be competing against the other labs.
You'd actually see the cost pushed down to a small  
multiple of whatever the marginal production cost 
of those tokens is. That would be my guess. It  
might be a mistake to assume that if we're going 
to pay a top AI researcher $200,000 a year—Lol. 
Let's say for the sort of AI researcher that I 
could be, $200,000 a year—that if an AI comes  
along that's as good as me, even taking into 
account the fact that realistically speaking,  
I only get maybe 10 hours of really 
top cognitive work done a week,  
that it would also be worth $200,000.
Obviously, it'd be worth much more than that in  
the sense that you can copy-paste its output and 
much less than that in the sense of whatever the  
marginal additional cost of spooling up H100s is.
If some kind of role comes along that the AIs are  
really well specialized at and 
outcompete the humans quickly,  
then we'd also expect to see that both the cost 
of providing that service would drop drastically,  
at the same time as the overall value generated in 
the economy by that service would increase a lot. 
Exactly, if we think that the value of cognition 
is going to be unbounded, and the way to derive  
cognition—to the extent you think solar will 
eventually win—you can derive it from how much  
land it takes to power an H100 using solar panels.
That is a very interesting derivation. 
At a minimum we're going to 
just fill up all the land. 
At some point you might have a declining 
marginal value of cognition or something. 
We kind of discussed this earlier.
If you have 10 acres of land feeding  
one megawatt of H100s or something, 
let’s say a megawatt is 1,000 humans. 
So one acre is a thousand 
humans’ worth of cognition. 
The implicit land value there is a lot 
higher than it is as undeveloped desert. 
It's also a lot higher than it is as the most 
productive farmland that humanity has ever had. 
At current hardware efficiencies. I 
don't know if it's worth spelling out. 
Basically, an H100 has the same amount of flops as 
a human brain, but also uses way more energy than  
a human brain. It uses 50x more energy.
Is that right? 
20 watts vs. 1000 watts? We know hardware can 
be at least as efficient as the human brain. 
The human brain can generate 
this many flops on 20 watts. 
If you do that calculation, that's 50x1000,  
so 50,000 AI souls off of one acre?
It could easily be much more than that  
because neurons are much slower 
than transistors, obviously. 
Probably 10 years ago, one of my friends reminded 
me, the way your phone saves power is it goes  
to sleep between you tapping out "hello".
H, it takes a nap, like 10,000 cycles. E…  
It's kind of nuts. I think Elon's talked about 
this in the context of self-driving cars as well. 
Anything humans do is glacially slow 
from the perspective of a computer. 
Let's go back to the original point.
I was explaining why I think it's  
plausible that there could be more than hundreds 
of gigawatts of extra demand from AI in the 2030s. 
I want to understand what that 
looks like in the real world. 
At that point, it has become 
basically this industrial problem. 
Can you generate enough solar panels and 
solar modules and batteries, and not to  
mention the chips themselves?
That's the industrial point,  
and then there's a cultural point as well.
Let's start with the industrial point. 
I want to know what the year 2035 looks 
like, if we've got AGI and we're just  
bottlenecked by the ability to deploy it.
What do you need in order to run? 
What is the minimum amount of matter that you 
need in order to perform these calculations? 
Right now we're talking about AI 
racking and grid and transmission  
and a bunch of ISOs and all the rest.
You don't need any of that stuff. 
Obviously, xAI is on top of this because the 
first thing that Elon will always ask is,  
"delete anything you don't absolutely need."
What you actually need is a big slab  
of relatively cheap silicon to make the 
power, and then a small slab of relatively  
expensive silicon to do the thinking.
If it's in space, that's all you need,  
because it's in the sun all the 
time, so you don't need a battery. 
If you're on the Earth, you need a 
battery as well, so you need some  
interconnects. You don't need a transformer. 
You don't even need a DC-to-DC converter. 
You can actually make do with a buck 
converter or with relays or whatever to  
match the current output of your solar array 
with the charge state of your batteries and  
the power consumption of your GPU or something.
But a solar array about the size of this desk,  
for example, will generate 
about 500 watts in full sun. 
So you can actually imagine aliens who have 
different silicon technology stacks building  
their systems as an integrated solar array with a 
bit of computronium in the middle, for example, on  
the same wafer.
But that's basically all you need. 
On the same wafer? Because it's all silicon?
It's all silicon all the way down. What's silicon  
made of? It's an element. It's chemically 
in the crust. There's no shortage of it. 
This is a great prompt for a sci-fi 
exercise, because especially in space,  
you don't need batteries.
The future TSMC just  
manufactures integrated solar dies.
And they can fly around. They're solar sails,  
and they're relatively dense so 
they don't fly crazy fast, but they  
don't need to because they're immortal.
Is this what the Dyson sphere will be made  
of, Casey?
Is it just going  
to be computronium at the center of a solar cell?
They can fly closer to the sun to get more power,  
right up to the thermal limit, and they can 
fly further from the sun to go and explore  
or fly to other planets or something.
They can adjust the orientation of the  
solar sail with LCD panels that could be 
integrated into the wafer itself. What's  
the post-human state? That's it.
A solar sail with a silicon  
die in the middle for compute?
One human's worth of computation.  
One human brain can be simulated in roughly 
a square meter of silicon floating in space. 
How much, sorry?
1-square-meter of silicon, like the thickness  
of a sheet of paper, floating in space. That's 
the future human form. That's my final form. 
That's the attractor state.
That's assuming a little bit of  
software improvement, but I don't think that's…
All that's assuming is software improvement. 
The Dyson sphere just needs a little 
bit of tweaking of the algorithm. 
The area of the panel is the variable there.
What do you need in order to make the silicon? 
Making solar arrays, making 
chips is a multi-stage process. 
Basically you start off with silicates, 
which are rocks ideally in a relatively  
pure form. You chemically reduce them. A 
couple of different processes can do that. 
Then you purify them into, ideally 
six nines of purity for solar arrays,  
maybe nine nines for really nice computers, 
and grow crystals, cut wafers, etc. 
So then the constraint is, well, how 
quickly can you convert the crust into  
enough silicon to support silicon thought?
What does the silicon ecosystem look like? 
Any thoughts?
Well, it's pretty quick. 1  
kilowatt per square meter and then you use that 
just to rip oxygens off the underlying dirt,  
it doesn't take all that long too.
You only need about 20 microns of  
silicon to make a solar PV array.
You mean like actual dirt? 
Yeah. Actual dirt has plenty of silicon in it.
For example, setting up a brand new  
silicon refinery takes about 18 months.
But that's just with the current technology,  
I actually think we may find new ways.
One of the nice things about having  
infinite free solar power, approximately 
free solar power, is that you can revisit  
a bunch of legacy industrial processes that 
have been optimized for efficiency and say,  
"Well, what if we just use twice as much power 
and we just want to do them faster and cheaper?" 
Less capex, less lead time, more power.
Well, you can start solving problems. 
It turns out that if you want to 
chemically reduce silicon, you can  
do it electrolytically with less efficiency and 
under a hydrogen-rich atmosphere or something. 
One of the ways that silicon can be 
refined is by turning it into silane,  
which is a silicon tetrahydride.
I'm not really a chemist,  
but I think that's right.
So SiH4, which is a gas,  
it's actually like methane, but one down on the 
periodic table. Don't breathe it though. Once  
it's a gas, you can filter it from all the 
contaminants which don't form gases or can  
be separated by density, much like how uranium is 
sometimes enriched, but much, much less difficult. 
You then heat it up to separate 
it back into pure silicon where  
you can then precipitate out a crystal.
The reason I think this is interesting is  
because whenever people are talking about 
the AI singularity, often their expertise  
is not in energy or physics or whatever.
They focus only on the cognitive elements  
of the singularity, which is like how 
much faster can we make AI smarter, etc. 
I think this is really interesting.
If we have unbounded cognition,  
which sets up both the ability to supply 
and to demand more energy, I'm very curious,  
what does the energy singularity look like?
We're just trying to saturate as much energy that  
the earth receives and turn it into cognition.
I hadn't thought about that before, but there's  
this idea that evolution resulted 
in this continual ramification and  
complexification of the thermodynamic gradient.
You start with very simple RNA-based organisms. 
Now you get this industrial economy.
But it may be the case—I don't have  
a strong reason to suspect one way or the 
other—that what we're seeing is the beginning  
stages of a collapse back towards the simplest 
possible thermodynamic-to-cognition stack. 
We have fusion in stars and the inky blackness of 
space and that provides our temperature gradient. 
Then the most efficient way to convert 
that into usable cognition is silicon. 
Literally electrons being pushed across the Fermi 
gap in a solar array and then taking the return  
path through some set of gates, making decisions 
about things and then beaming lasers to their  
friends, saying, "Hey, I just made up a new meme."
That is an interesting concept. For 4 billion  
years we've been increasing the 
variance in complexity of creatures  
and then you might see this big collapse.
Should I give you the opportunity to plug why  
people should work for Terraform?
Just to give you an introduction,  
Terraform is my day job.
It's a company I founded almost four years ago. 
We are making synthetic natural 
gas from sunlight and air. 
We are also working on other 
core primary materials stuff. 
We also have a methanol process.
Methanol and methane together are precursors  
to every hydrocarbon you could possibly want.
Another chemical, ammonia,  
processed steel, desalination.
We can also make cement and a few other things. 
Basically everything that the primary industry 
does, except for glass and paper. We are hiring.  
Our jobs are available at terraformindustries.com.
Yes, the website's meant to look like  
that because we're very cool.
We are some very special people. 
I know a lot of smart people and I'm privileged 
to work with some of the smartest people I  
know. We are mostly mechanical engineers. 
I will never hire anyone who can't do math. 
I will never have the problem at Astronomer 
because we don't have a head of HR. 
Also the CEO is not having an affair.
Yeah, step one. 
I think that was a more crucial issue, Casey.
Heads of HR can get into trouble. 
I'm just saying, everyone does math.
It's very important to me that Terraform  
is the place that ambitious hardware people go 
to become the best they can be. That is really  
important. It's not here to check in and get 
your paycheck and optimize some shiny widget.  
It's still a small team. It's still like a 
one project per person kind of situation. 
And I will level you up—maybe not 
quite like a Jensen "torture you  
into greatness" kind of situation, but 
at times it's going to feel that way. 
You get to work with the best people that there 
are, at least on the West Coast of the United  
States, on this sort of thing. It's also a 
unique company. I thought years ago, by now  
we'll have competition. We don't. No one else is 
doing this except for a small startup in the UK. 
So you get in on the ground floor and 
it's going to be super cool technology. 
Eventually we get to go and build it all on Mars 
as well and help our robot overlords make more of  
themselves out of dirt. It's pretty cool.
Nice. 
Come work for us.
Casey, thank you so much  
for coming on the podcast.
Thanks for having me. 
This was fun.
Yeah.
