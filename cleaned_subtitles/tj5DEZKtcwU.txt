Hi everyone, I'm Anthony.
Welcome to my channel
today
We continue our discussion on the deeper meaning of the NPD narrative.
This is also part of our NPD series.
This is the third episode.
In the first two videos
We agreed together.
The positive significance of the concept of "NPD"
It enabled many people to recognize harm for the first time.
The Language of Self-Rescue
But at the same time, we also discussed
This critique of NPD
It is also heading in a strange direction.
It demonizes and exaggerates a psychological concept.
For an all-encompassing
Metaphors for pure evil
When we take a broader perspective
Let's look at many trends of thought in Chinese society
We will all find
Many of these initially only served to inspire resistance against tyranny.
The theory of pursuing liberation and moving towards awakening
In reality, however, it has led to a strange situation.
That is
These theories, while empowering some people,
But it might make another group of people
They became even more deeply entrenched in the identity of victims.
The parties involved are making continuous accusations.
In the process of that persecutory force
They did not become more motivated
On the contrary, it exacerbated the situation.
Their fear and powerlessness against that persecutory force
In other words
Many statements that seem to promote the awakening of subjective consciousness
Instead, it became a more covert method.
Symptoms of escaping subjectivity
Human beings' evasion of awareness of subjectivity
Possesses tremendous creativity
So what exactly is the fundamental difference between them?
Why do some awakenings empower us?
But some "awakenings" make us feel even more helpless?
Today, we'll delve into this topic.
I will upload this video.
Included in the list of "Psychology and Education"
If you have anything you'd like to discuss with me
And the topics of consultation
You can contact me via email to make an appointment.
First, in the previous video
We draw a core conclusion:
NPD's seemingly powerful control
Its true components
Not from its own origin
It possesses some kind of inexplicable magic.
The main sources are two aspects.
The first is determined by environment, culture, and institutions.
The power and dominant position bestowed upon him
Secondly, and more discreetly...
We need to muster the courage to face it.
That is
The wounds and deficiencies that already exist within ourselves
In the last video
We mainly discussed various power relations.
So, this video...
We need to turn the camera completely in our own direction.
To explore that more difficult
But also a more liberating topic
Our trauma
How does one become the key to being "controlled" by the other party?
When we think like this
You will realize
The destructive power of NPD
We can see
and healing one's own trauma
Go to change
Rather than some inexplicable and incomprehensible evil
It's actually not easy to admit this.
Attributing evil to an inexplicable nature
Even though it makes a person live in fear and pain
Feeling unable to act
But it can also make a person feel
I don't need to face the specifics of life.
There's no need to solve the problem.
Because the other party is too powerful.
Why do I say that?
Let's start with a concrete example.
In the first video
We mentioned the male NPD who pretended to be a wealthy man.
He met a woman by striking up a conversation with her.
Intentionally or unintentionally revealing one's success in one's career
My WeChat Moments are full of travel and luxury goods.
And picked them up in luxury cars
When this woman thought
When I was about to embark on a "sweet romance"
I only discovered it from someone else's revelation.
All of these identities are fake.
Undoubtedly
This man's behavior was pure fraud.
It is immoral.
But for our own growth
We need to raise that more important question.
Why in the hearts of those involved?
Does flaunting wealth equate to a sweet romance?
If I encounter a similar person again
Is this outcome of being deceived truly unavoidable?
When a person is attracted to something flashy...
Perhaps he could gently ask himself this question.
Behind this attraction
Is it stemming from some kind of deep-seated sense of lack within oneself?
If a person experiences poverty during their growth process
Or living in a state of anxiety about financial insecurity for a long time.
So what is wealth to her?
It's not just about specific amounts of money.
It's also about "safety" and "stability".
The strong psychological symbol of "being protected"
A man driving a luxury car
She might not see him as a show-off.
Instead, it was someone who could free her from existential anxiety.
The rescued hero
Even though she has temporarily escaped poverty
But her identity
Still trapped in the scarcity of the past
This yearning for security
It can temporarily short-circuit a person's rationality.
Because of rational analysis
Potential damage
The illusion that brought her temporary comfort
And if she sees
And healed himself from his material problems and issues with his family of origin.
The trauma experienced
So when she encounters such a person again...
What she saw was
All topics about this man
They all revolve around money and material possessions.
She had absolutely no interest in my inner world.
They are also unable to have any in-depth exchanges.
The result was that the person involved simply felt bored and dull.
As for whether the other party is really rich...
It's not that important anymore.
For example
In China
More common is a fascination with symbols of power.
A man always casually mentions at dinner parties
"I know Director So-and-so."
"I have had dinner with a certain official."
For someone who experienced powerlessness from a young age
For young people who feel powerless
He probably did it without thinking.
Falling into the worship of these symbols
These things are to him
It possesses a kind of witchcraft-like magic.
He doesn't think.
This so-called "familiar relationship"
Is it a strong relationship or a weak relationship?
He wouldn't think either.
This power may be subject to influence from superiors.
Or various internal constraints
In his imagination
The system itself is monolithic.
Omnipotent
Of course, he was deceived by this person.
They certainly deserve sympathy.
But this is not an entirely unavoidable ending.
Let's take another, more common example.
A woman's growth in a
In an environment where one is constantly neglected and belittled by their parents
Her parents didn't see any of her achievements.
This left a deep wound in her heart:
I am unimportant
At this point, a male NPD appeared.
He developed a strong idealization of this woman.
He began to pursue the woman intensely.
He kept saying: In my eyes,
You are unique.
Your family simply doesn't understand how special you are.
However, this male NPD's praise and compliments
It is often empty, exaggerated, and cheap.
It doesn't possess any terrible magic.
For example, his feelings, upbringing, and experiences regarding this woman.
A more complex and subtle psychological journey
Lack of interest in understanding and listening
And they're always in a hurry to use some nice-sounding words.
Use highly generalized, broad terms to draw a conclusion about the other party.
For example, courage, intelligence, excellence, and individuality, etc.
Although these words sound beautiful
But it blocked the woman.
To fully express oneself.
She couldn't give a specific answer either.
Observable details to prove the other party's uniqueness
For example, this man's praise
It may be inconsistent and wavering.
When this lady
When it matches his imagination of an intellectual woman
He praised the lady enthusiastically.
How cultured!
However
When the woman raised a viewpoint he was unfamiliar with
Or when refuting his ideas
He didn't want to think about it.
Instead, they started criticizing the other party for not thinking maturely enough.
The same principle
He might be praising the woman for her independence and courage.
But for independence that is beyond his understanding
impatient
Therefore, this kind of praise based on "idealization" itself
It's not really that ideal.
Instead, it's up to me; it's like Lord Ye's love of dragons—he only paid lip service to them.
Fragile and inconsistent
It is precisely because this idealization has so many flaws
Therefore, such NPD
Therefore, they do not possess the ability to unconditionally sway the other party.
This kind of bewitching wasn't due to any magic he possessed on his own.
Rather, it is limited to those who believe in this illusion.
Effective
So, having said that...
Some people might say
Anthony's view
Isn't this blaming the victim?
Is it demanding that the victim behave perfectly?
Of course, this is a misunderstanding.
We need to distinguish between two types of responsibility here.
External and internal responsibilities
External responsibility
That is, what we usually understand as
Ethical or legal responsibility
if
Someone was simply exercising their rights normally.
However, he was deceived and hurt by another person.
Therefore, the victims are of course 100% innocent.
There is no need to bear any responsibility.
This cannot be explained by the saying "flies don't land on eggs without cracks."
Using such words to confuse right and wrong
And what we call internal responsibility
This refers to responsibility at the spiritual level.
It has nothing to do with fault.
No one has the right to criticize
It is an existential responsibility
In this sense
People have responsibilities at every moment.
We don't need
Take responsibility for the objective harm you suffer.
But after we were hurt
How do we save ourselves?
But it's something I can take responsibility for.
External liability is conditional.
It depends on my specific abilities in this society.
Identity, location, etc.
For example, I am not a firefighter.
Therefore, I have no responsibility to rush into the fire to save people.
The greater my ability
The more responsibilities one has to bear...
Internal responsibility, on the other hand, is unconditional.
It is based on my self-awareness
This self-evident fact
I am a subject capable of reflecting on my own situation.
Even if I give up my self-awareness
That was also a choice I made to give up based on my own self-awareness.
Therefore, I still have to take responsibility for this.
This means so-called mind control,
Mind control, brainwashing, etc.
They can never completely and absolutely control a person.
I often hear some friends talk about
I experienced a severe sense of being manipulated.
For example, being aware of one's every move
All bear the marks of the persecutors.
The voice and thoughts of that persecutor
In one's own heart
Issuing orders every moment
So much so that I can't do anything.
Can't do anything
There was nothing we could do.
I understand
These feelings are 100% real on a psychological level.
They do indeed stem from real-world harm.
However, they can never completely determine a person's spirit.
Our living environment
Many times it's not our choice.
Instead, it was thrown in.
For example, I was born into a terrible family.
A repressive collective environment
Or imagine an even more extreme situation.
A person is unjustly thrown into prison or concentration camp
But even in this state
He at least still has a choice
Attitude towards this kind of life
Is it passive acceptance or active resistance?
Even if only in spirit
At this point, some friends might say
These environments
Wouldn't that cause psychological trauma to a person?
indeed
Many of the videos on our channel discuss trauma.
Externalize the problem
For example, a person's learning difficulties
Tracing back to China's education
Tracing certain anxieties or depression back to childhood experiences, etc.
However, realizing this
This is not to suggest that humans are powerless.
Completely determined by the environment
In fact, this kind of tracing and analysis
It is precisely by increasing our own capabilities
For example, when we analyze trauma from the family of origin
A common misconception is
Individual discovery
My every move is decided by my parents.
So he went to judge his parents, who were far away.
Go and confront them
Or rather, to change them.
These actions can certainly exist.
But ultimately, the goal of treatment is still to differentiate oneself.
Before understanding one's own trauma
A person's inner world can be a state of chaos.
It was filled with conflicting voices
One is internalized parental authority.
They are from past interactions with their parents
The alienated self formed
Or rather, a false self
These false selves
On the surface, it is issuing orders in its own name.
But in reality, they are agents of their parents' will.
The other is the voice of the true self.
The person involved could not distinguish between the two sounds.
When the harsh voice within resounds in your heart
He might mistakenly believe that it was his own thought.
Mistakenly believing that I am really bad
Unworthy of many wonderful things, etc.
However
When we gain insight and awareness of trauma
The ability to increasingly transform the alienated self
When identified as a foreign object from the outside
The outline of our true self
It gradually emerged.
The true self is achieved through contrast and separation from the alienated self.
Only then can a clear definition be obtained.
On the surface
This is an attempt to shift responsibility to one's family of origin.
But essentially
This is a retraction of one's inner world.
Final interpretation and management rights
This is precisely what bears the most profound responsibility.
It is also the most powerful internal responsibility
This is completely different from the logic of victim narratives.
In the victim's narrative
NPD is someone who can control my mind in real time.
Rather than through his agent in my heart
If a person believes
The other can appear in a mysterious external way
Control your own mind
So what is the focus of his life?
It will be placed on the ongoing battle against this manipulator.
Then he might find
NPDs seem to be increasingly prevalent and ubiquitous.
It was like a ghost.
It may be parasitic on those around you
In any person's body
For example, in this article "50 Features to Identify Male NPD",
NPDs are divided into high-function and low-function categories.
Dominant and recessive quadrants
Furthermore, she likes to purse her lips when taking photos and grinds her teeth and shouts in her sleep.
Road rage while driving is considered an NPD (Neutral Damage Disorder).
It can be said that as long as a person's self
It appears slightly more relaxed.
These could all be manifestations of NPD.
When an individual feels that the outside world is full of terrifying enemies
Trying to find solace and support within the NPD survivor community
They still won't feel safe.
The revolution must continue within this small community.
Divide into factions and identify enemies
For example, in the NPD survivor community
Some people said
Be wary of bloggers who criticize NPD.
It may itself be NPD
Because according to the NPD classification standard
The characteristic of latent NPD is
By playing the victim, complaining, and feigning grievances.
To try to gain sympathy and manipulate others.
According to this statement
Regardless of a person's behavior
Confidence or inferiority complex?
Is it flamboyant or reserved?
Is it happiness or unhappiness?
All of these can be categorized into a certain NPD type.
Final Individual Discovery
I seem to have grown into an NPD-like figure.
This brings the concept to the forefront.
It has become all-encompassing.
Metaphysical concepts where subject and object are not differentiated
When standards become so vague and subjective
We can certainly do it on anyone.
Including finding his shadow in ourselves.
And this kind of exorcism ritual
This meant it was destined to be a battle that could never be won.
It will only make everyone
Falling into deeper suspicion and painful internal strife
