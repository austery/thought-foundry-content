Have you ever smelled a landfill?
Well, that smell is probably
not the worst thing that it produces.
Methane gas is.
And you cannot see it or smell it
until it catches fire.
And that's unfortunately
what's been happening
in many cities across the continent.
In Dakar, in Accra, in Kampala, in Lusaka,
and recently at the Pietermaritzburg
landfill in South Africa.
Now just imagine being one
of the thousands of kids
affected by that fire.
Every breath you take
is kind of a tighter chest,
a sharper headache.
It's really unacceptable.
And these landfills,
they catch fire for many reasons.
One of them is that we keep
sending organic waste there
that decays in the absence of oxygen,
creating the conditions
for methane to come up.
There's many ways that we know
how to solve this question
of dangerous landfills.
First of all, stop producing as much waste
and sending it there.
Sort and treat what's already there
and radically improve
the governance of those sites.
Doing that homework
has immediate benefits,
particularly for populations
living nearby.
It improves air quality
and it reduces the risk of fire.
And it turns out that addressing methane
out of these landfills
plays a very important role
in tackling the global question
of climate change.
I’m a social economic
development professional.
I've spent the bulk of my career
looking at how this continent transforms
to meet the demands
and the ambitions of its people
at the intersection of democracy,
security and economic opportunity.
And it's kind of always been clear to me
to get to a certain degree
of sustainable development,
we need to embed climate in our plans.
And I’ve joined the Global Methane Hub,
and it’s become abundantly clear
that effective climate progress
also requires methane action.
And that is because methane
is such a powerful greenhouse gas.
It has contributed up to 45 percent
of the net warming
that we're experiencing today.
That's because it is 86 times
more powerful at trapping heat
than carbon dioxide is over 20 years.
And all of you, and myself,
we know that we've got to do
so many things simultaneously
to address this question
of both climate and development,
and long-term decarbonization
is one of the primary goals.
But methane offers us
an additional opportunity.
If we're able to come together
and reduce methane emissions
by 50 percent over the next 20 years,
it allows us the opportunity
to lower the rate of global warming
by 0.3 degrees Celsius.
That may not sound like much,
but it is a lifeline.
It is also one of the most effective
ways that we know of
to reduce short-term
climate-induced vulnerability,
and that is important
all over the globe, obviously,
but it is critically important
for this continent
that's disproportionately affected
by the effects of climate change.
We lose up to five percent
of our yearly economic output
to adverse climate events.
The costs of adapting societies,
our societies and our economies,
to changing climate are skyrocketing,
upwards of 50 billion dollars.
So this idea of addressing
short-term vulnerability,
it’s not a nice-to-have,
it's an imperative as we build
towards long-term resilience.
And look, 60 percent of these
vulnerability-inducing emissions
come from sectors that have traditionally
been associated with economic progress:
fossil fuel energy,
waste management and sanitation,
as well as agriculture,
rice production and livestock.
And what you're seeing behind me
is a map that shows you
cumulative emissions
over the past 50 years.
You have sharp eyes, and you're seeing
that some regions are emitting
a lot more than others
and need to do a lot more and a lot faster
to address their own emissions
if we're going to meet
our collective objectives.
This map shows you per capita,
emissions per person in 2023.
Again, sharp eyes.
You'll notice that Africa
has a lower footprint
than many other regions.
But that is changing.
It's changing because
we're growing populations,
we're growing our economies.
And so we've kind of
got to embrace this duality
where we absolutely need to usher in
a new developmental model
that rapidly lifts people out of poverty,
creates opportunity
and provides for more dignity,
but to do so in a way
that minimizes these emissions
that are creating the vulnerability
that plagues us today.
And luckily, it's happening
in many ways on the continent.
Let's think back to those
burning landfills that we discussed.
Well, in Durban,
a different picture is coming up.
Organizations have come together,
civil society, government officials,
research institutions,
to ensure that no or less organic waste
ends up in a landfill
35 kilometers outside of the city,
and therefore hopefully
limiting methane emissions.
And to do so, they've partnered
with two of the largest
city fruit and vegetable markets.
And rather than throwing away
unused or unsold produce,
they collect it and they transform it
into an asset class.
They compost it.
Remarkably, over two years,
they've been able to divert 277 tons
of organic waste away from landfill.
They've created sustainable,
safe, well-paying jobs for the community.
They have reduced the city's costs
in landfilling and transportation.
And that compost that you're seeing
is going to improve the quality
of city parks
that families like yours and mine
can end up enjoying.
These are real benefits
that also end up reducing methane,
and it is the power
of community-driven action,
underpinned by a circular economy approach
that is part and parcel
of the systemic change that we need to see
and that needs to be supported
by better policy,
better financing and improved governance.
But let's also talk about energy.
Fossil fuels are a major contributor
to global methane emissions.
It is also one of the sectors
where we kind of know how to abate
at cost in the short term.
But let's also be very clear:
this continent will need more energy
for better development.
That's an existential question for us.
And luckily for all of us,
actually in this room,
80 percent of new generation capacity
coming online in the next few years here
will come from renewables.
And if we're able
to strategically pair that
with adequate investments
and adequate planning,
it accelerates our ability
to diversify our energy mix
away from reliance on fossil fuels.
And that is really important
first and foremost
for our own energy security.
It is also critically important
because it helps us abate emissions today
as we transition in the long term.
Because, mind you, the industry,
oil and gas industry in particular,
absolutely knows how to solve
their emissions problem.
Reduce flares, detect and plug your leaks,
improve measurement, do it all over again.
And they have the money to do it.
It's just not happening
at the scale and the speed
that we need it to happen.
We just cannot rely
on voluntary commitments.
We absolutely need regulatory frameworks
that compel corporate action,
because otherwise this is what we get.
This is a gas flare.
It is the burning of methane gas
associated with oil extraction.
And it is as dangerous,
as wasteful as it looks.
It is associated with high levels
of respiratory diseases
and high fevers, particularly in children.
And astonishingly, two million people
in the Niger Delta in Nigeria
live within a four-kilometer radius
of one of these things.
And so what do we do?
We regulate, we enforce and we track.
And that's exactly what the government
of Nigeria has been trying to do.
It has essentially passed
progressive regulation
to ensure that it is banning flaring.
Enforcement is where the challenge is,
but they're doing so
because it makes sense
from a public health perspective
and it saves lives,
but it also fundamentally
makes economic sense.
It creates a potential revenue stream
for government from non-compliant actors,
but it also reduces energy waste
in a country that is plagued
with energy insecurity.
Regulate and force and track.
Let's talk about something else.
Rice.
Some of you are smiling.
I know you love it. Many people love it.
It's a major global food crop.
In fact, it is consumed
by billions of people
from Tokyo to my hometown
Conakry in Guinea.
And we will need
to be producing more of it
to meet food security demands.
And rice production is actually
both affected by climate change
and partly contributes to it
because it emits methane.
Think about the millions
of farmers who grow it.
Typically what they do
is they flood their fields.
By flooding the field,
oxygen cannot get into the soil
and it creates the conditions
for methane to emerge.
And so how do we solve this?
How do we ensure
that we're improving productivity
and production to meet food security,
but doing so in a way
that minimizes emissions?
Well, 11,000 farmers in Accra, in Ghana,
or around Accra,
are working very closely with
their Environmental Protection Agency,
and they're attempting to use a method
called alternate wetting and drying.
This is a method that only when conditions
are suitable and applicable,
allows them to naturally
drain the water off their field.
In doing so, they are managing
the incredibly scarce resource
that is water,
but they're also managing
production and productivity,
and limiting methane emissions.
That is good for the producers,
it's good for consumers,
it's good for food security,
because ultimately we will need
more resilient and sustainable
production systems
that also reward smallholder farmers.
And we can't stop there.
We absolutely need to continue
to have multidisciplinary spaces
in which we provide more solutions,
more cost-effective solutions,
less risky solutions to these farmers
who are central to the systemic change
that we want to see in food systems.
And listen, what I've described here
is a series of projects and initiatives
that essentially show a window
into the nexus between
climate development and methane.
And it's certainly not a panacea.
And they need scale,
and they need improvement.
But what they do show
is progress that builds momentum
that people can get behind
because they can see the benefits.
And we will undoubtedly
need that momentum,
partly because to get
to a high-development
and low-methane future,
we will need systemic improvements.
And that's also why some of the things
that African nations
have been working towards
require a lot more support,
particularly in ensuring that we're able
to raise domestic resources and capital
that allows us to self-fund
climate and development
in a way that increases agency
and decision-making here on the continent.
Things like bringing together
African financial institutions
around the Africa Club,
or addressing the incredibly high cost
of capital that we face,
or sovereign debt burdens.
Unlocking that capital is integral
to moving methane action forward,
because unfortunately,
a lot of these methane emissions
are going up, globally,
and much of it is also underreported.
And so there's really
no getting around or away from
the centrality of governance
and accountability,
of which we will need more of
first of all at home,
because we need to manage
our affairs better,
but also globally
to ensure that we're understanding
where these emissions are coming from
and how we tackle them equitably
for greater collective impact.
It's also the case that
in this distributed multipolar world.
Eventually we will probably need more
rather than less collaboration,
particularly leaning
into domestic capacity
in a much more creative
and distributed way
across geographies and across disciplines
to support better scientific research
and breakthroughs,
to improve data measurement
capacity across the globe,
and to get to more effective
financing options.
And I have no doubt that this continent
will rise to the challenge.
First of all, because it is
in our own self-interest
to move away from vulnerability
and into resilience,
but also because
it is a necessary thing to do.
And I've spoken a little bit
about some of the co-benefits of methane,
and you'll hear a lot of that,
but perhaps it's fitting
to flip the script a little bit.
Maybe when we build systems and societies
that reward safer,
cleaner and livable cities,
more resilient,
more nutritious food systems,
more diversified
and productive energy systems,
low methane is itself the co-benefit
of that better developmental pathway,
and that is good for planet,
but it is also fundamentally
good for people.
And hopefully that's something
that you all can also get behind.
Thank you.
(Applause)
