There's only four billionaire people in sports. You have LeBron, you have Jordan, you have Tiger, and then we got
>> Introducing the towering point guard from the Midwest. Number 32, Magic Johnson.
>> How you did it was not just sports, but majority from business. I don't just want to win in sports, which I have 18 championship rings. I also want to win in business. I'm going to do everything I can
>> Mhm.
>> to make sure that deal or that partnership wins.
>> Yes. When we bought the Dodgers 2.2 billion
>> where everybody said we overpaid. Now it's 8 billion. The Commanders is 2 years old now. 6 billion. And now that the new stadium that's going to go even up higher. We pour so much money into sports. And nobody's ever going to stop watching sports in America. Right now you got companies looking to buy teams.
>> It's always been an asset class, but now people really see the long-term reality.
>> Most of the rich people before us took the knowledge with them. They didn't share it.
>> Exactly.
>> This show right here today, we covered everything. There's nobody else on TV that can cover all the things you and I just covered.
>> Magic.
>> Hey, Chris. Good to see you, man.
>> Good to see you. It's a pleasure.
>> You know, I'm glad you're able to come through today, man.
>> Well, thank you, man. It's uh all the great things that you and I have been doing for these years.
>> Years
>> and now we get a chance to sit down. I think this is important for a lot of people
>> and a lot of different reasons, too.
>> Absolutely. Look, I think that, you know, like you said, this is a culmination, I think almost 10 years of of from investments to conversations to, you know, bring having you come up to San Francisco talking about venture, uh, expanding the portfolio and and we wanted really just to take the time today
>> to to because, you know, you are one of the ultimate deal makers, businessmen, entrepreneurs, uh, and that's also the same ecosystem that we have here at A16Z. And I felt like there was no better way uh to have a conversation that bridged both worlds than than than to have you come on today. So, you know, so I appreciate you.
>> Again, thank you because you brought me in though. You know, I think a lot of times,
>> you know, somebody has to pull your coattail or somebody has to
>> uh make sure that you can see deals or you can see opportunities. Yep.
>> And I want to thank you for 10 years.
>> Yeah. making sure that I've
>> had a chance to see these great opportunities that I've been have a chance to invest in.
>> So again, you being in there, being an executive, being a dealmaker yourself
>> and then bringing in so many different artists and athletes.
>> Absolutely.
>> Who now can say they're businessmen or business women because of you. Well, it's not I might have played a a big part on the investment side in terms of getting people into Silicon Valley and getting them and understanding, you know, the benefits of equity versus endorsements, but you know, you were the one that actually pioneered, you know, getting getting into business itself. And, you know, a funny story that I've always thought that actually inspired me and I think that we have one tiein from the very beginning. Uh, and that's actually one of my first mentors when I first got into into Silicon Valley, and that was actually Michael Oitz. Yeah.
>> And so I I don't know if you know that, but the firm was actually built off of CA's model and and Oitz was on the board of of Market Ben's company. And so that's where they originally got the idea for for A16Z and having a service-based model. Um, and so when I first got the got the job and started working at the firm, um, I got a chance to meet Mike and my position was actually it was a a code word. It was called mini oit. And so like I was like I don't Ben was like we can't call you mini obit. So we got to and this is never no one knows about this. So it's it's so it's like we got to figure out um a very specific strategy. And the the funny story is that um he told me he was like look Chris uh the first sitting down and and and I you know I came from the entertainment industry as well too and so I needed a gap in order to understand how to think about things and he was like you need to first order of business
>> I need you to have a breakfast, lunch and dinner meeting every single day for a year and uh and then come back to me uh and let me know what you learned. I was like this is the craziest idea that I've ever like why are you telling me this? And so, but then after going through that journey and understanding how to build a network and understanding how he thought about things was was really important. Um, but I say that because that he also first, you know, talked to you and when you when you were thinking about getting into the game and and sitting down having that same conversation. So, I I I don't know if you could just just go flashback.
>> Yeah. I I told Dr. Jerry Bust, the owner of the Lakers, that I wanted to become a businessman. He became my first mentor. But then he told me, "Listen, you need to uh meet a guy named Michael Owens."
>> Yeah.
>> The King Deal maker.
>> Of course. Of course.
>> And in in Los Angeles and in the country, right? And so
>> I said, "Okay." So I reached out to Michael Oitz
>> and I said, "Hey, I would like to take a meeting with you and because I want to become a businessman after my playing career is over." And uh he said, "All right, come on in." So Chris, I get there
>> and I think I the meeting was around 2 o'clock. Of course, I'm I'm early for everything. So I got there about 1
>> and I'm sitting in the lobby. It's 3:00. It's 4:00.
>> And now finally it's 5. So the assistant come out and get me
>> and I go into his office and he shakes my hand. And the first thing he says, you know, uh, I don't know about representing you. Athletes, they spend more money than they make.
>> Y,
>> um, I don't know if you're serious. I don't know if you have what it takes to become a businessman. I represent everybody in Hollywood. I got all the producers, the directors, the actors, actresses, the writers. He said, "Uh, h, you know what? Nice meeting you." And he threw me out.
>> You're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
>> Like, wait a minute.
>> What?
>> I came here for
>> Exactly. I thought I was get something done. I had a pen in my pocket. Yeah.
>> And so, um, a couple weeks later, he calls back and he says, "Uh, I checked you out."
>> Mhm.
>> And Dr. Bus told me that you were serious. And he says, "Uh, okay, come back." So, I came back and he had a stack of magazines
>> and he said, "Here,
>> you read these." Yeah.
>> And I'm gonna give you a test.
>> Yep.
>> And if you pass the test after reading all these magazines, then I'll think about representing you. So, of course, I went back and read that same day. I read them all. Right.
>> Right.
>> And then whenever he called me a couple weeks later, I went back. He did the test. I passed the test
>> and he said, "I see you're serious about becoming a businessman."
>> So he he took me all around town.
>> Yep.
>> Meeting everybody. We we met for lunch a lot.
>> He loved meeting at his favorite restaurant. And this is he taught me so much not just about business
>> about just the art of
>> deal making and and also making sure you have a long and big rolodex.
>> Yep.
>> You know and you might not need the people today but you may need them tomorrow.
>> And so so what he did I remember we go to his favorite restaurant. That's when Morton was the place to be.
>> And he had the table.
>> He had the one table
>> the table in the middle. So he says, "Watch what happens when I sit down."
>> Okay.
>> So he sits down, we we sit down
>> and after two minutes, everybody came and kissed the ring.
>> They came over to him.
>> Hey, Michael. D. And so as he was talking to him, he would always introduce me to him.
>> Yep.
>> Everybody that came over, he would always also make the introduction to me. and Chris about 6 months later I'm meeting all these CEOs of companies
>> uh through Michael and so then here comes the Pepsi deal.
>> Yep.
>> When I became a franchisee of Pepsi, he put Earl Graves and I together
>> and man that took off.
>> Uh here comes Starbucks, you know, all these things because he was right in the middle of everything. And then the last thing he did, he reworked my contract
>> to make me one of the highest paid in the NBA.
>> But he did it and then I said, "Well, how much I owe you?" He said, "I don't want nothing from you."
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> That's who Michael Oates is.
>> Exactly.
>> Right. And so I wouldn't be where I am today without Michael Oitz
>> about uh you know everything that he did for me. making me smarter,
>> make me understand business,
>> make me understand deal making. Also,
>> make sure that you go in and you ask questions and you really
>> uh get the knowledge. He was big on making sure you had the knowledge, right? Being being an expert
>> at uh uh not only deal making but also understanding the deal, also understanding the sector,
>> whatever you're getting involved in. Well, I mean because even on our business there's three different sides. First you like you have to be able to see the deal like and say and then okay the deal that comes in then after that the next stage is saying okay I actually want to make that investment.
>> But the third stage is actually the most important stage which is winning the deal. Yeah.
>> You know in ter and that's kind of like how you're talking about in terms of being able to identify those right opportunities and then being able to then you know execute and do a right deal on top of
>> execution. Execution and more execution. Yeah.
>> Yeah. I mean, that's that's that's interesting cuz I mean, when you when we look at kind of, you know, doing deals and and thinking about opportunities, a lot of it really does come down to relationships. And so, how do you put think about your network and and how that's kind of cultivated into your the relationships and the deals that you have been because often times, you know, in venture, it's a very long-term game. You know, you're not just thinking about just doing the deal immediately. there's there's a lot of steps and process that that come into it and and you know you have to give first in order to have these things happen. So how do how has relationships uh and and the EQ of the business really kind of became you know it seems like that's a superpower for you that allows you to have these opportunities come your way. Yeah, you're right because I built a fabulous uh relationship when you think about with Ron
>> Burkel
>> and you Kyper and we did the equity deal, the private equity deal we had. Um and you know, we did some amazing we bought some amazing companies and but I knew Ron for 10 years before we actually did a deal together. Right. Yep. When you think about customer service,
>> that's what really it taught me everything I needed to know about customer service. Yeah. you know, and so, um, having a great partner and, uh, going into Starbucks and really understanding the business side of it
>> and and you know, a cup only cost u,
>> you know, less than 10 cents or 15 cents at that time.
>> And then the sugar, the beans,
>> and then you and it all start to line up. You're like, hello. And so your margins were in incredible when it came to that, you know, and so um I' I've been blessed to
>> uh create not only great partnerships, but also uh having these people as friends as well,
>> you know, and uh and so then I just carried that on to all the other things. Mark Walters today.
>> Yep. um uh you know, Peter Gruber, you know, all these guys who I'm in business with. Uh but Dr. Jerry Bus treated me like I was his son. Yeah.
>> And I think that uh
>> when I think about our relationship and him opening up the door for all these other people, for me to meet them and them to become my partners. Yep.
>> So I I really look at it like when you when you come into business with these people, you have to play your role and do your part as I tell them, what role do you want me to play in this partnership? Y
>> So I'mma overd deliver to you and to the company and and to this partnership.
>> So it's like a team.
>> That's right. Yeah. That's right. And and uh instead of me being a point guard and a leader like I'm normally
>> Exactly. You know, a little little tell me what you need.
>> Now I'm playing a a role player in business with these men. Yes, sir. and it's okay, you know, and so um I am uh happy about that and um these partnerships have uh been huge
>> and um lucrative and um but I learned so much from each individual.
>> Yeah.
>> And so they taught me so much and I I was like a sponge.
>> Yep.
>> You know, I wanted to get up under them and uh learn a lot. I think one of the things that you can be a sponge of is not just one specific industry but multiple different verticals. Right. So you said from food and beverage to hospitality to now the insurance business and um and and now you know sports, media, entertainment, there's so many different variables but all kind of having that one consistent uh vehicle or or mindset in terms of service and and really overd delivering is is important.
>> I think you're right. And so sometimes uh people want to be in one industry and I think for me uh that was never my mindset and so
>> and then there was nothing sexy about anything that I invested in.
>> Yeah. No, but that's but that's that's where it is. Boring businesses keep that's that's a secret. You know, everybody wants to find the hottest company and sometimes that might be it might go up and then next thing you know it could be a trend. You you're absolutely right, Chris. You're absolutely right. And it's more those that fail or like go start up and then go down. Yep.
>> And so, but the ones that are boring and people don't know about or care about,
>> those are the ones who are on a consistent making money or going up, you have growth. Yeah.
>> And uh so uh that's where I want to be. Absolutely. And so, uh, um, you've done a great job, and I want to say this while it's on the top of my mind, of teaching these entertainers and athletes long-term investing.
>> You know, it doesn't come immediate.
>> Exactly. You give me You invest into the fund. They're like, call you back 18 months later. Hey, I need this back. I got to go out this weekend. Like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
>> It doesn't happen like that.
>> Yeah. Hold on a second.
>> But thank you for that. uh because they've learned a lot from you and the deal making uh expertise that you have and so um yeah it's it's
>> Thank you for that. I appreciate
>> No, no, it's building your network. is is building um like we talked about your rolodex and then it's going to lunches and breakfastes and dinners that you probably don't want to go to but you should be there
>> and because those were those places are where the dealmakers are. Absolutely. Those places are where the billionaires are, the multi multi-millionaires are. And so
>> I learned that early on
>> and so when I got invited I went and then I went early. over said, "Go early because all the richest people
>> Exactly."
>> Cuz they know about their time, right?
>> Exactly.
>> They they ain't trying to hang out.
>> No, they not trying to hang out. They come early and they want to leave early. Absolutely. And you'll get that quality time with them. Y
>> if you go early.
>> See, that's a gem right there. See, you know, see early is to be on time.
>> That's right. That's right.
>> Absolutely. Not CP time.
>> No. No. No. Oh, you don't get nothing for that.
>> Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. No, but I I think that, you know, even how we we it's a lot of the soft skills that really kind of, you know, really lead into the these real investment opportunities and being in the room and having the right time. And so, like I'm curious when I mean when when we first met, we met in Silicon Valley when we were doing the the Skyo deal. That's right.
>> Um I think it was the the series A at the time. Um what what was that interest in because you were that was almost 10 years ago. Um, what was the interest when you were thinking about expanding your business portfolio to to get into startups and to think about why Silicon Valley was an interesting opportunity to explore um when nobody else was really you were literally one of the first people that we that we did a co-investment with that that gave me the idea to realize, oh my goodness, like this is a huge opportunity
>> not just for our portfolio companies to have access to someone like you and your networking and and and the relationships that you have, but also for the portfolio companies to learn from you and you know, I called it like share genius where you have the best of both worlds really just coming together and and and having and you getting a chance to talk to the CEO and and and how that's kind of conspired. But what was your original uh interest in terms of like thinking that this was actually something that that we you should be exploring? Well, first of all, when you go back, uh, so I did the movie theaters with Peter Gruber and Mattis Johnson theaters.
>> Howard Schultz and I did Starbucks, 125 stores and 40 different markets.
>> And I just told you how he taught me so much about customer service. And so I was looking for what's what's the next uh growth opportunity for me and my company, right? M
>> because we want to continue to evolve, grow, and think outside the box. Y
>> So I said, "Wow, all the money is going towards Silicon Valley."
>> Uh and so how do I get into that world? Right. And then here you come.
>> This little old Yeah. Yes. That my smart young man see. And so uh
>> I just needed that foot in the door. and you provided that foot in the door for me and uh and also Ben as well knowing him. And so here comes this opportunity with Scottio
>> and the drones and uh to uh be able to be a early investor. Uh
>> the product wasn't even it was still in prototype.
>> That's right. That's right. That's right. And so that really excited me
>> and I think it took me and my company to a whole another level because that brought me into Silicon Valley. I didn't have that in Silicon Valley.
>> Yep. Yep.
>> Now I had it everywhere else, a great track record of success, but I didn't have it there. And so that that deal provided me with a a track record in Silicon Valley and then opened up the doors for me
>> to see other opportunities that I didn't get a chance to see.
>> Uh and so uh again I want to thank you thank Ben for you know the opportunity that I had. Uh you you two also my friends. So, absolutely.
>> It's sometimes
>> it's about timing.
>> Mhm. Mhm.
>> See, some people forget about that part of it. It's it's it's about sometimes it it's just not your time to do that deal.
>> Yeah.
>> Or or that or have that opportunity. Y
>> and it just lined up perfect with the right people being you being Ben
>> and the timing was right when Scottio was just coming out with their product
>> and so
>> and it was a consumer product at the time.
>> That's right.
>> And then you know with you just now making a couple of the investments into the sports teams and seeing how an autonomous drone could potentially be the future for sports and in entertainment and and then when we're outside the Four Seasons.
>> That's right. That's right. and a prototype and it was going up.
>> Exactly.
>> But but to that point you just made, who would ever thought now
>> they use drones for everything.
>> It's crazy.
>> I mean, so we were way ahead of the curve.
>> I know, man. That's what we do.
>> That That's what people don't understand.
>> We were way ahead of the curve. And now you think about every sports league, every uh fire department, every police department, on and on and on. Y uh
>> defense contracts are now going very crazy off of it.
>> That's right. They all use it around the world.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think that for us, one of our investment strategies is a simple one, but it's a tough one, which is like good ideas that look like bad ideas, you know, and so sometimes you have to think outside the box and see around the corner when you're making these investments and and often times a good idea looks like a good idea. That means everybody can really do it. kind of intersection where there's like Adam for example like he grew up just you know doing RC racing and and he he eated and breathed this and used to work at at Tesla and so knew the the opportunity around autonomy
>> uh and and really kind of creating that opportunity and so you know that's what we look for when we're looking at founders like what what do you see cuz now Now we opened up the box. Everybody's, you know, hitting you and your team trying to get you to invest into the next series A, the next series B. Like when what do you look for in founders or or or the next entrepreneur um that's trying to have you become their an investor?
>> Well, I think first of all, you're you're right. You know, it's um is it something that is not in the marketplace? Um, can we really look at this 10 years from now that it's going to still be here?
>> Yep.
>> It's going to still um it has growth potential.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh hopefully year year in and year out.
>> Mhm.
>> And then um do we have a chance to exit or sell?
>> Yep.
>> You know, down the line. Uh, and so, um, and then the partners, I I want them to make sure that, uh, these founders and these great people, they have skin in the game. They also, uh, are great and they're experts at what they do. Yep.
>> And, uh,
>> um, you know, we we then also look at it. Can we bring added value,
>> right? being Magic Johnson,
>> uh, all the things that we have in our toolbox, can we can we bring added value to the deal or to that founder and make that company grow or take off and fly? One of the things that I always tell founders because they always, you know, whenever we might either get you into a co-investment or present the opportunity and they have the opportunity to to sit in front of you and your team, initially they always think, okay, well, we need to get magic and have him be the face of this or tweet this and you know, and I think that people are now finally starting to understand that, you know, the the the iceberg, tip of the iceberg is magic and Irvin the the the the face, but the enterprise and the networks and the and the introductions that you can make to whether it's the sports teams, whether it's to, you know, the insurance companies, whether it's, you know, strategic businesses. Now, I think that people are really starting to understand the true value of talent and when they're thinking about um having somebody on their cap tables.
>> Yeah. Because we see we're in we're politically strong. We're we're uh CEO strong and you know we we um our rolodex is huge and long and powerful
>> and so
>> we know how to grow businesses. We've been doing it for a long I've been in business over 30 30 years and I tell them all the time utilize us utilize our network our expertise. Uh, and so then once they get into partnership with us, then they say, "Oh, you didn't know."
>> Exactly. Like, "What you what did you think?" It's called Maggie Johnson Enterprise.
>> That's right. That's right. And that's what we talk about when we say the added value. Yeah.
>> You know, you want my check,
>> but also too, you should want everything else that we bring to the table because I'm used to winning.
>> Yep.
>> I'm used to winning.
>> I mean, you just you just got another another little chip check.
>> That's right. That's right. I I still got a little got a little little championship on my shoulder, bro. So
>> So to so to that point, Chris, I don't just want to win in sports, which I have 18 championship rings. I also want to win in business. So I I have a mindset of winning. And uh I'mma do everything I can
>> to make sure that deal or that partnership uh wins. And so, uh, that's why you'll get my whole team and, uh, everything that we have to to hopefully support what you're doing.
>> Yep. The next generation of talent, the next generation of whether it's athletes, entertainers that are interested in business, that are looking to invest into Silicon Valley, um, you know, they often like what how should they think about structuring a team in in today's time?
>> You just said it. You just said it. What they fail to realize is structuring a team. Just what you just said
>> because that's so important. See, you're great at what you do.
>> Yeah.
>> You know, basketball player, football player, singing, being an entertainer, but you're not great at business. So you have to get a team
>> that is great at business that you control that is a part of your entire enterprise that can help you achieve your goals in business.
>> Yeah.
>> And Michael always pointed that out to me. Yeah.
>> Get people who are smarter than yourself. Get the right people and always pay them and then let them do their thing. And he was absolutely right. So, I'm telling all of them out there, you got to get a a team of people who can help you. Uh that while you're on the stage singing, they're conducting business somewhere. Exactly. Right. Exactly. Uh they're making deals for you. Um and remember, these are not people you going to hang out with.
>> Then nor do you need them in there.
>> That's right.
>> Cuz if they're in the club, then who's signing that check?
>> Exactly. So they spending your check.
>> Exactly. They spending your money. So, so to your that point, uh I've always looked for for u when we're in the infrastructure, okay, let's get some experts in infrastructure, you know, uh on and on and on. So, that's what you got to do. So, I would tell them that that's be the first thing I tell them. Y
>> make sure you get a great team around you. And also, those can tell you no.
>> See, they're not used to somebody telling them no.
>> Yeah. Yeah. No, they don't even know that that that words don't even that's not even the vocabulary.
>> They'd be like, "No,
>> no, no, no, you can't do that." Or, "No, you can't write that check." Or, "Your friends are bringing you deals that make no sense." No, that's you know, and so, uh, that's important as well.
>> Yeah. Um, I'm curious when you when you think about deals, I mean, especially, you know, when it comes to venture capital, no one bats a thousand. No. Um, you know, we have that it's called the Babe Ruth effect where I have the highest number of strikeouts, but you also have the highest number of home runs, right? And so, you got to swing for the fences for every deal, but there's some deals that that you might miss.
>> And, you know, all within any venture capital firm, you you've missed a deal and and and just that's just the nature of the beast in the industry. Do you have one in in your that you can remember where you like either looked at the opportunity wrong or you missed the deal or like that that one just either got away like you know just just cuz you got 30 30 32 years plus in the business you know if you were striking a thousand then then you know I'm just curious kind of if you can and what did you learn from that? Yeah, Chris, there's always deals that you know you wish that you had wrote the check and you didn't or deals that
>> you know um you heard about too late between the Ubers and all the deals like that
>> that you say, "Wow, you know, uh you had an opportunity but you just uh didn't pull the plug. I mean, you didn't pull the the the string to write the check, right?
>> Yeah.
>> And then you have a deal like Nike when I was young and they wanted to sign me but give me stock.
>> Why did I meet you? Why did I meet you about 40 something years ago?
>> Hey, well, you got to call my mom and call my
>> and
>> I would have loved to negotiate that with
>> Exactly. Phil Knight said, "I don't have the money they have, but I got stock." And they and they just ran the analytics. If I had a deal did that deal in 1979,
>> it'd be over a billion dollars. So that's the one that you talking about one that got away,
>> man. I'm sure
>> that's the one.
>> Michael owes you aund billion papers.
>> Exactly. Exactly. So, so again, you know, there's deals that
>> uh you always
>> will think back and say, "Man, I wish I had did that deal." But at the same time,
>> Mhm.
>> um I'm not a guy who goes backwards a lot. I move forward. I'm always constantly moving forward. Um what I have is what I'm supposed to have.
>> Yep. Yep. And and so I'm not The great thing is uh being 66 now, I'm not the same young guy I was then.
>> So I can see deals different today. Yep.
>> And better. And I have a team of people who vet those situations where I didn't before. So So things have improved. I've gotten better.
>> And so again, uh what you don't have, you don't have.
>> Yeah. But but you learn. You learn. And you won't make that mistake again.
>> That's right. That's right. I think one of the things that I mean but you learned this ex extremely quickly was the the power of equity
>> versus just you know writing a check and getting endorsements. And so, um, h, have you seen that continue to to change in terms of just more people outside of the industry that are now starting to look at equity based deals versus, you know, instead of just trying to get traditional endorsements or
>> I think you're seeing it now across the board
>> and you're seeing it. Well, look at it from actors.
>> Yeah. You know, all these actors now are doing equity deals instead of taking the money, right? You see that
>> creating their own brands.
>> That's right. Creating their own brand. Yep.
>> And uh making a lot of money.
>> And then you see the same thing happening with the athletes uh and just everyday people too, you know. And so, yeah, it's it's changed a lot where before you you you you were brought up and you were coming up and you supposed to say get the most money,
>> get the check,
>> get the check.
>> And well, things have changed now.
>> And I think there's a lot of people who uh were able to help people understand that's not the way to go.
>> Yeah. and and so now you're seeing some of the um most high pro high-profile people, celebrities now owning, like you said, their own brands, their own companies.
>> And
>> I mean, we see it on our end when people are wanting are are wanting to invest into the next big companies and understanding now that, you know, it's not, hey, I'd love to work with you. You should write me a check. It's like, I'd love to work with you. here's, you know, some some money so I could get on the captain.
>> And I think that's what's really changed.
>> Yeah.
>> Before athletes said, "No, I'm not gonna write no check." You know, I know give give me give me give me and you were like and they,
>> you know, they was like, "No,
>> but also the founder doesn't happen like that. That it's two totally different worlds. We're in Silicon Valley. People, you know, they don't we it's a series C or a series A company. They don't even have a marketing budget like that." And so, but it's like, well, we do have stock, right?
>> You know, and then wonder how that could play out over. No, everybody
>> changed, right? So, so let's try to make it happen.
>> And uh but
>> hey celebrity, hey athlete, hey, you got to be driven by the equity now. And and sometimes the equity and you got to write a check to be a part of that as well. Absolutely.
>> So, but but they're willing now. They're more educated, I think, today, but because of people like yourself who are their age
>> and can help them understand
>> and teach them how the game is played today versus yesterday when I came around. Yeah. Right.
>> And and I think one of the reasons and you kind of talked about it when around creating that halo effect is that we can when we make these investments now and I think that you know before used to just be on one or you know Wall Street Journal or Techrunch. Now when someone makes an investment or the new companies are being built um in in Silicon Valley, they go across mainstream media from Complex to Essence Magazine to you know uh all on social media like Boardroom um you know there there's whole entities now that are being created that are really expressing the business of of investing and I think that it's and now people are it's in their conscious mind and they're thinking about the next generation of those companies.
>> Yeah. And and that's what's so cool about 2025 now. Yeah.
>> Right. And so
>> I look at Steph Curry, you look at LeBron,
>> the companies that they have built off the court,
>> right? Uh uh Snoop, uh Dr. Dre, on and on and on. Uh Kevin Durant. I mean, these guys are just doing
>> uh they owning teams now while they still playing. Crazy, crazy.
>> And so, so it's just uh it's just beautiful. And and you see um Tom Brady and the uh on and on and on, you know, the Manning brothers. So, you see all these
>> former athletes and current athletes and again um
>> uh there's so many others who are just uh taking advantage of their brand and star power, but turning it into a successful company.
>> Absolutely. Yeah. And I mean you were the literally the first one. I mean you like you said uh is that you know people were saying why are you even interested in business and now you fast forward 25 years like that the cool thing to do is have you know a company that that you can actually go and invest into and you can build your own brands. And I think that with um you know even like when we think about the world of crypto and AI um you know you can we one of our thesis is that at one point one person will be able to build a billion dollar business with the tools that are that are available right now you know um being able to use prompt engineering to to actually create a business plan or think about different strategies and all those things. And so I'm curious where where do you see kind of the evolution of with these next generation of product of of of technologies coming? I mean everyone talks about what's going on with AI. I mean we're very big believers in the future of blockchain technologies. Like how are you seeing those worlds kind of develop and what you have going on and what what if you have a specific thesis?
>> Well technology it just keeps going and growing. I mean, man, you and I way back investing in technology and still investing today in technology.
>> And like you said, AI now is
>> it's is it's is it's going to blow people's mind.
>> Uh it's already blowing our mind where where we are today with it, but it's only going to get better. Yep. Yep.
>> Right. So um I think everybody's now uh have have changed and said okay I'm moving money from over here exactly invested in this to invest in AI
>> and um I I I say to everybody and uh you got to get in early. Mhm.
>> So to a lot of uh today's uh young successful people,
>> look who else is investing when you look when you look at a deal and that's going to tell you everything you need to know,
>> right? I'll tell you. I mean, I can't tell you the amount of times someone's reached out to me, been like, "Oh, hey, you should I do this? Should I?" And I'm like, "Well, who's leading the deal?" And then they're like, "They don't have a lead yet." And I'm like, "Well, then you're the lead. Duh.
>> And they're like, "Oh, that's a good point."
>> And you don't want to be that.
>> Uh, you know, and so for me, I always look at who is the lead, also who else is in investing, and then I'd say, "Okay, they got a track record of success. They've already vetted this this deal frontwards and backwards." Yep.
>> And if they wrote a check, I'm writing my check.
>> 100%. Also, the industry is super important and and I think you know you you've recently um had an opportunity to to join the cap table on alchemy health and also with function health which actually just announced their series B today. Um you know you're developing an amazing portfolio in the intersections of AI bio and and and where the future of innovation is going from there. How how do you think about that in terms of just that specific sectors especially with and now people are the next big companies are all coming and saying okay well I see magic has invested in these businesses like I I think that this is the next big one
>> yeah cuz you take alchemy and buildingarmacies and places that they don't havearmacies y
>> and uh we were just at a conference in DC and we made
>> multiple deals just in DC
>> they opening.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> They said thank you.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, um
>> and they're doing amazing.
>> They're doing an amazing job.
>> Uh and heavy demand
>> fories.
>> A lot of them are all the big boys are closing a lot of theirarmacies and drugstores and now
>> but they're still in need especially in in specific areas that don't aren't in the mainstream
>> e. Well, that's that's the key. Yeah. Right.
>> Rural America.
>> Yep. Right. The inner cities. Y
>> uh there's plenty of opportunities for Alcoy to take advantage and they are.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> And these cities are courting them.
>> Right. They need it.
>> They need it. That's how I look at it. If the sector, if there's demand and heavy demand,
>> just like you look at AI, it's heavy demand for it across every industry, it's going to help everybody, right? Lower your your your your cost. Uh you're going to be more efficient. Mhm.
>> Uh you're going to be faster.
>> Yep. Yep. And you got you literally have the world's information just right there on your fingertips, ready to help, you know, build you the next product. Exactly.
>> Code the next company
>> faster, quicker.
>> Yep.
>> Less money.
>> Yep. That sounds like a win to me.
>> And and you make more money. So So again, you know, I want to make sure I'm you know, companies are on the cutting edge and are doing things we've never seen before. uh or or there's a huge demand like alchemy there's a huge demand y and man it you it's almost you can't miss right
>> well you've seen I mean the funny thing is is that you've seen it before
>> you think about the theaters you think about Starbucks all the things that that uh we did
>> uh there was heavy demand for it in the inner cities but nobody was going in there building them so we it was supply and demand right So we met that and man everything just hit a home run and so uh and then we just kept that business thesis going
>> and then here come companies came in and said oh wow that's a huge marketplace. Uh minorities do have a lot of spending power right and right now we're what over a trillion about $1.4 four trillion dollar spending power between uh African-Americans and Latinos is a couple trillion
>> 100%.
>> And exactly. And so nobody was going after their disposable income. So that's why I built my business in those communities and uh to your point. So I will continue to look there, but because now
>> my company is more global
>> and we're doing bigger bigger deals. So, so and that's a sometime a problem that you and I have our friends, right? Yeah. And people that we know who are great people who are celebrities and so you know they bring you deals and they're too small and they don't understand I've I've outgrown those deals. You know
>> like what's that what did you say? You said like that the same amount of time I'm I'm going to work on this small. That's right. For a small deal, I could be working on a big deal. Yep. And we got to put our efforts in those big deals. And uh but it's nothing wrong. And so everybody has to start somewhere and they have to understand that
>> don't think that you have to start where I am or where LeBron is or Steph or whoever it is. Uh it's it's okay to start small and grow your business and grow your company.
>> But for me, uh you can't get mad at me because I said, "Hey, my deal's got to be here."
>> Yeah.
>> Because again, that's where my company, my brand is. And uh so and that's the calls that I'm getting today
>> where yesterday I was getting the other calls but not today. All all these big big deals they call me and say hey we want you to be a part of that's why how I got in the sports team.
>> Exactly. I remember when I went to your annual uh conference down in Laguna you uh you you had your whole team around and you just were just pointing about look at my portfolio. This is the this is the value in billions. And then so you had you emphasized like if we're going to keep growing this, we're going to need exponential value. And so you're going to have to, you know, swing for the fences and think bigger continuously.
>> Yeah. Because uh Chris, we look, let's let's just break down when we bought the Dodgers 2.2 billion. Well, everybody said that was we overpaid, right? And uh today, this is not from me. This is from Forbes and all the companies. Now it's 8 billion.
>> Yep. Yep. Right. Right. So, so uh
>> billion. Yeah. Dr. Buzz bought the Lakers for $65 million. They just sold for $10 billion.
>> Lake show, baby. You know, uh the Commanders just two years old now. Uh 6 billion. Now they just said we're closer to 8 billion. And now that the new stadium that's going to go even up higher, right, that we're building today. So sports,
>> uh, I know we always talk about it. Why do I invest? Well, it's easy
>> cuz the valuations are so high and nobody's ever going to stop watching sports in America. That's where we get away. That's that's our release. That's our get away from our everyday work life is to watch sports and that's why it's always going to be uh these teams the valuations of these teams will continue to skyrocket because of that
>> the sparks.
>> Yeah.
>> I mean that I mean you did that deal uh super early before people the the WNBA wave even really took off like that
>> and we were losing money.
>> Exactly.
>> And so
>> so why did you decide to hold on that? Well, because first of all, we thought that someday it would change
>> and and we wasn't losing a lot of money, but we were losing money, but stuff that we could Okay,
>> it's okay. We're comfortable with the loss.
>> Y
>> uh and we didn't know it was going to turn around like this.
>> Yeah. No, exactly. You said
>> from now the team is worth like $300 million and growing, right? Crazy. And we but we only paid a few million for the team and now it's where it is. Uh but give uh a lot of the players a lot of credit. Give uh college basketball, women's college basketball took off and then that that fan base came in to the WNBA and start watching that uh as well. So So um
>> no, we're still blown away about the growth of the WNBA and where it's going. Uh, soccer in America, same thing. LAFC,
>> we're we're going
>> valuation over a billion dollars. I think we're one two.
>> Yep.
>> Man,
>> it just keeps growing. The NWSL, the women's soccer league, same thing. It's just skyrocketing now. They all have great TV contracts. The WNB, that's the reason why they have great TV contracts. And so, uh, it's just it's just amazing. So, that's why I invested in sports teams
>> and they're growing more,
>> growing and growing and growing. And then streaming came in.
>> All those companies
>> really allowed these leagues to grow because they all want sports content.
>> Yep. So much even like what happened with YouTube a couple weeks ago, YouTube TV when they shut off ESPN for a couple weeks and and Disney and everybody was like, "No, hold on a second. We got to get this deal right.
>> Yes. Yes.
>> You know, cuz that's how important it is.
>> That's right. And young people get everything on their phones.
>> Oh yeah. You know how many times we'll be eating dinner and then like you just still you going out to eat and then you got the game on.
>> They told me a lot of people told me they were watching the World Series when my Dodgers won back to back and they said they'd be out to dinner and they was they wasn't listening to their wives or or girlfriends. They were like, "Wait a minute." Oh,
>> and uh one guy told me they were at a wedding.
>> Yep.
>> And said all the guys sort of went outside,
>> right? Y'all good? Y'all going to be good?
>> Okay. We going outside and watch the game on our cell phone.
>> And so, but that's that's how they consume their content is on that phone. Well, one of even when you were when you were talking about sports when we were upstairs, one of the you said one of the secrets uh to why these teams are growing and obviously with the success of the Dodgers when you purchased them and and the Sparks and and you know continuing and now you know with the Commanders and so many other teams is that you have to not be afraid to spend money. You got to spend money in order to make money.
>> That's right. Um, so break break that down because I mean even from our portfolio companies and founders thinking about, you know, always just conserving the cash versus going out and and and and really putting the money to work.
>> Yeah, Chris, that's a great point. Um, when we bought the Dodgers, we put a couple hundred million into the fan experience into the stadium.
>> We had to increase the fan experience. What is every league and every team talking about today?
>> Yeah. how to increase the fan experience because then the money will come back to
>> the owners, right? And so because of that,
>> now the Dodgers is just
>> we're making money that no major league
>> baseball team has ever made revenues. It's been crazy, unbelievable. So it came back to us. And so I can tell you so many different situations that you have to invest in the team
>> in the stadium. Uh because it will come back and the players because that's the number one thing. You had to put a great product out on the field. Yep.
>> Uh that's where we're we're we're growing the commanders. That's the next step for us. How do we get better,
>> you know, and so uh we're going to do that. We finally got our quarterback and Jaden Daniels, but we have to surround him
>> with uh more weapons. We have to get better on the defensive end. So So we we're taking steps. Uh, but every team got to put money into the the player development, the players itself, and and then last but not least, making sure that the fans are happy because you're asking them every year
>> to come back.
>> Yeah. Come back and ticket prices go up.
>> Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. Yesterday's price was not today's price.
>> Exactly. Exactly. And uh so uh and and and they're going to say to us, okay, if we're going to pay more money for our season tickets, then what are you going to do as the owners?
>> Yep. And as an owner, I mean, that it really it boils down to, you know, it's not just the team itself, like you're working with operations, you're working with so many different
>> uh puzzles and and obviously when when you were playing, you were the captain of the team. um for the founders that are thinking about building and scaling their teams like what what is it that you think that they should keep in mind or what would be you know what's your methodology of thinking when it comes to keeping a team together as you're going towards these goals?
>> Yeah, I I think first you know uh making sure that you do invest in player development uh analytics.
>> Yep.
>> Yep. when I played no analytics today. You got to have a whole staff.
>> Yep.
>> Because that's how you win in today, right? And uh
>> right right hand pitcher versus left-hand pitcher. That's right. This percentage.
>> That's right. Uh in basketball, this guy shoots from the right side on threes and he make them more than he does on the left side or force him left because he doesn't score well. Going I mean on and on and on. So, so I've never seen uh analytics come into it's in every sports now.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh football, NFL, football, basketball, baseball, baseball actually started analytics really in sports. So, so uh so invest in analytics and then uh marketing because you got to have a great marketing team
>> to to help you go out
>> and and tell your story and what you're about. That's right. Your way, what you're about. Um, and so between that marketing, PR team, you got to have a great one. And then I would tell them um uh identity.
>> See, people going to uh latch on to your identity. What is your identity?
>> But why why do I even need to even be with you?
>> That's right. Right. What is your identity? Who are you? Uh players also going to ask you that. what's the identity of the commanders of the Lakers or the so and so and so uh
>> and then are are do you want to win cuz a lot of players and a lot of fans going to be saying hey Mr. owner. Do you really want to win?
>> Exactly. You know,
>> Ben says it uh you you you're either playing not to lose or you're playing to win.
>> It's either one or the other. And that's and he's and he's right. And every every group I'm with, you know, they're they're playing to win. And um that's why uh you know, we're every team I have but the Sparks. And this year now, the Commanders won't be in the playoff, but uh every team was in the playoff.
>> Absolutely. And so we're playing to win and and and so the fans see that.
>> Free agents see that.
>> Yep. Yep. Yep. Cuz they're like, "Hold on a second. I I'm I'm tired. I'm tired of going to Cabo."
>> Exactly. And I want I want to be in the playoff. Why do old Tani
>> Yeah.
>> leave the Angels to come to the Dodgers?
>> Yep.
>> He had never been in the playoff and he wanted to be in the playoff. That's why he signed with the Dodgers and he's backto back World Series champion.
>> Yeah, I know. That was one of the best uh best World Series I You guys had I was on the East Coast, man. You guys had me up till 3:00 in the morning watching that game. Yeah,
>> that 18 in game.
>> Crazy. But I'm I'm locked in.
>> Yeah. And everybody says the same thing.
>> I I I couldn't believe it.
>> That series changed baseball and the MLB and uh for the better. Mhm.
>> And I think that we brought in fans that normally didn't watch baseball.
>> Absolutely.
>> And so, uh, again, that's what can happen sometimes when superstars play like superstars.
>> Yep.
>> Otani performed well.
>> Um, Guerrero from their side performed well and on and on and on. They all uh played like superstars. That's what made it so entertaining. And the highs and the lows, that's what sports give you, right? One minute you're up 300, the next minute they tie you and they take the lead. Exactly. I mean that that series was going back and forth. So it's a beautiful thing. That's why again we love sports
>> and we
>> pour so much money into sports. Y
>> right now you got companies looking for opportunities in sports. Individuals who
>> didn't think about investing in sport. Now they're looking to buy teams.
>> It's an ass. It's always been an asset class, but now people really see the the the long-term real value. And can I add this? The WNBA got so many people willing to uh invest and own teams and bring them into markets they're not in.
>> Exactly.
>> NWSL got so many more people want to buy a soccer team today that wouldn't been interested in one two three years ago.
>> Exactly. I mean I think Atlanta was just just got uh just got added recently. That's right. and and and because they know that behind everything there's real business that's associated around
>> and a lot of revenue streams.
>> Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think a lot of even our our companies when we're thinking about even like the next generation of AI video, right? And being able to be able to work with these companies and find unique ways to bridge technology and and and and innovation in because if you're building a business from the ground up in 2025, you're starting a brand new company. You're not going to do things the old way. Oh, you can't. You know, and and and you think about with the tools that are available now, like that means just by default, you can since say instead of us having a, you know, 100 person team or we could actually do this with 10 people and then and now we have we can still operate at 10x the speed. That's right. because of where you know whether it's the you know from AI to using blockchain and all these different resources is really helping push innovation forward on the business side
>> and and and that's in everything just think about my journey
>> uh you couldn't pay an athlete in high school college and now NIL
>> now high school players are getting paid
>> couple hundred thousand
>> uh college players getting paid millions a dollars, which I'm so happy because when I came through Michigan State and I was dating my girlfriend, who is now my wife, Cookie,
>> I didn't have no money
>> to take her to to get something to eat, right? And they couldn't pay me cuz that was illegal. But today,
>> these young men and women, these these uh college athletes, these high school athletes, student athletes I should say, are getting paid a lot of money. So name and likeness is so amazing. And now you got companies
>> Yeah. Yeah. building building products specifically for that.
>> That's right. That's right. So things have really changed. And this this show right here today,
>> this has been the best show because we've covered every everything. There's nobody else on TV that can cover all the things you and I just covered. That that's that's amazing. Well, that I think one of the main reasons is because we're both we both are passionate about this and we're both actually in it, you know, every single day, you know, like we're not, you know, just on the outside reporting in. We we're right after this, you going back to your business call. I'm running back to go to the next meeting and we're going to and we're going to keep it going.
>> And our phone going to be ringing because everybody going to say, "How can I get down with you guys?"
>> Hey, well, listen. I Well, you got to start get 10 years in the game.
>> Yeah.
>> In order to help make it happen.
>> Yes. Exactly. But I I I think that like you know your your journey and this is why we just wanted to wanted to make sure you were the first one that we we shared this with because you did it like you said we talked about the NIL deals. You talk about all those things like you know the contracts were way different back then when you did it but you how you did it was was through a ser was was not just on the sports but all majority from business. That's right. and in and a number of deals that led you into going taking one thing, taking your investment in Starbucks, flipping it into Dodgers, just continuing to build. And so I I I think that, you know, as much as we love you as the the Hall of Fame athlete, I you're a Hall of Fame entrepreneur.
>> Thank you. Thank you, Chris. Are you a risk taker?
>> Absolutely.
>> You see, and I think a lot of times, uh, that's what they have to ask themselves. Are are are you willing to take the risk from from the money that I did make from Howard Schultz and Starbucks? And again, thank you, Howard, because you he
>> made me legitimate.
>> Yep.
>> That Starbucks deal sealed the deal for me. And so, but I was a risk taker. I put up my money.
>> Yeah. Exactly.
>> You know, I put up a lot of money. You got to pay to play.
>> That's right. And Dr. Bus said, "I love you."
>> He said, "I love you as a son, but you got to write a check for a friend." I said, "Yes, sir." And and so,
>> but that's real.
>> Yeah, that's real. And think about this and all these athletes and entertainers out there that we're talking to and of course other people.
>> I was in a position, see, I saved my money.
>> Mhm. Mhm.
>> So, every deal that came that I had to write a check, I was ready to do that.
>> Exactly.
>> So, that's what's important.
>> Interesting. That's a That's a gem right there.
>> That's what's important. Mhm.
>> And so while you blowing it on so many other things, remember when that deal come and you you have to put equity,
>> you have to put skin in the game. You got to be ready for that.
>> Stay ready so you don't got to get ready.
>> That's right. That's right. So I wanted to throw that nugget out there. And uh that's so so important. And um man, my journey, you know, the best compliments I get is from all the current guys, the current hip hoppers, Rick Roth, all them
>> uh common. And they all say, "Man, we couldn't do what we're doing today."
>> Yeah.
>> But we can do it because of you. Absolutely.
>> You showed us the way. And I said, "Man, that's a that's a great compliment." I remember comment pulled me aside. He said, "Man, we don't respect a lot of people, but every time I get into any concert, we talk about money, we talk about owning something, they all say you." They point to you and I say, "Well, thank you." And and I'm just so happy that Michael and I um can say, "Hey, now look at KD. Look at Steph. Look at LeBron. It's more than them. There's so many other Draymond Equadala. I mean, I can keep going. There's so many great businessmen out there and women cuz the WNBA, those young ladies are doing great things. And so I want to also shout them out. And um it's it's been a blessing man to sit here with you.
>> Mhm.
>> So that we can educate and also help others.
>> Yeah.
>> You know who want to get into investing or Silicon Valley owning their own company. It's not easy.
>> Nope.
>> But uh it's doable
>> if you if you put the time in. You got to be willing to put the time in.
>> Yeah. 100%. Because like you said, we're after this, you and I running and I'm going to be on the phone in that car.
>> Exactly. Exactly.
>> All the way back to the office
>> doing deal. You and I was separately on phone do before. You ready?
>> Exactly. And that's what it takes. And then last but not least, I got to say this.
>> Yeah.
>> Don't be afraid to partner. See
>> that myth, we got to get rid of that myth
>> that you got to be the only one.
>> Yeah. Yeah. It's abundance, man.
>> That's right. You and I are partners. So, see, you didn't have to bring me in. You could have just said, "Oh, I'm good." Exactly.
>> But you brought me in. And so, and so I I want all these young people to understand that, too. Uh, it's okay
>> to collaborate.
>> That's right. It's okay.
>> Yeah. and uh and and and then do multiple deals. Do keep going
>> because
>> they
>> Chris, you're so needed in today's culture.
>> I appreciate.
>> See, cuz I'm older, you're young. So, they're looking at you saying, "Dang, I want to be like you or I want to partner with you. I want to teach me." See, sometimes we're afraid to say, "Hey, somebody say teach me."
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Right. and you know so much and you you've helped so many and that's been your blessing and your purpose.
>> Of course, you're rich and going to be richer, but you're rich by a lot of different ways. You're rich by money, but you're rich also with your rolodex and your knowledge and your willingness to spread that and give it to somebody else.
>> The downfall of minorities have been most of the rich people before us took the knowledge with them, didn't share it.
>> Exactly. Okay. So, I wanted people to know this is the man right here.
>> I appreciate Look, well, I I I wouldn't be here if we didn't have the opportunity to to to to soak up your your wisdom and and just the foundation that you've created and, you know, you've been my inspiration behind everything when in terms of taking business and bridging these worlds together. And so, I appreciate you taking the time to to have this conversation. Um, you know, you're you're a friend. You are uh always there whenever we need anything. And and in return, we just want to keep on running it up.
>> That's it. That's it. Keep on winning them rain on our face. 18 19 20.
>> I appreciate you, man. This was super needed.
>> Uh and you know, I I'm glad we were able to get this wisdom down. You're the man. So,
>> thank you. I appreciate and so are you.
>> Oh, thank you, bro. Appreciate.
>> Thanks, everybody.
>> All right. Signing out.
>> Signing out.
>> But not signing off.
>> No, no, no. Out.
>> Exactly. No, that was amazing. Great man.
>> Yeah.
