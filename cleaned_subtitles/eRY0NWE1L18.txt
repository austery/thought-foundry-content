[Music] hi everybody our special guest today is Andy Ransom the CEO of rill which is the world largest Pest Control provider now many people have uh memorable stories about pest related stories whether it's removing you know ants rats uh alligators even from pools so um Andy let's kick off what's kind of the crazy story you have oh my word well uh hi n thanks for inviting me along um look I mean we could probably spend the next hour talking about crazy pest control stories that's that's that's what we're going to do that's what we're going to do is okay well you know where where to start I mean uh we were hired by Libya to go and deal with Bubonic plague that that was a bit of a surprise we uh we've done some work in Australia with mouse plages where we had millions millions of mice to deal with we've had um monkeys in Singapore we've had camels we've had to deal with in the middle East I mean you name it snakes and everything it's it's um it's a crazy business in that sense say as you say everyone's got a pest control story and and um my wife always tells a pest control story about me um when we were living in in America and I was I was doing the garden one day and I Disturbed a a nest of yellow jackets or wasps as we would call them and one of them stung me and stung me in the neck and I ran like a scared kid and I ran into the house open the door I then closed the door and I locked it and my wife was saying what what on Earth are you doing you know why have you closed the door are you expecting them to come in through the door you have they got a set of keys but that's a sort of you know panic and and uh reaction that pests generate in people so it it is one of those those subjects that as I say everyone's got an experience everyone's got a story but it is an amazing industry what are the big drivers of this uh industry well I think you know somebody once described the business to me as almost biblical you know the pests have been with us since the beginning of time and they will be with us till the end of time and and that that is true you know the pests will always be with us right now certainly global warming and an increasing temperature of the planet there's no doubt that that is having a bearing um that is altering the breeding season of flying biting crawling insects so if if it's hotter you tend to see the the SE seon start earlier and it goes a bit longer because of the the temperature so that's one thing um regulation legislation the world is is increasing with uh its its regulatory environment that's not getting easier anywhere um Rising standards I mean I remember when I used to travel to uh parts of the world years and years ago and I'd go out to dinner and there'd be a cockroach would run across the tablecloth and you'd just flick it to the floor you wouldn't accept that uh today in in a nice restaurant so Rising it do it doesn't look these rages they don't look so good on social media do they they don't look so good in social media and that's a big part of you know why why do companies uh hire us well they need uh their health protected but they need their reputation protected as well and that that's a key part of what we're doing particularly for the for the businesses so you know you've got regulation you've got climate you've got increasing standards you've also got Rising middle classes and in big chunks of the world particularly uh in the emerging markets you've got urbanization the towns and the cities are getting bigger and bigger uh and you've got people with more and more money why are bigger cities good for you well it's because um you know if you take rats and rodents for example they go where the food is um and people go to the cities uh the cities are typically not so clean restaurants put the trash out the back they they they leave it around uh and rats in particular will find those sources of Food they'll find places to live so the bigger the cities the the more urban they become the more likely there there to be an attractive place for rats to to come and move into so that's that's one of the key reasons that um urbanization has an impact quite a big impact on growth in the pest control industry I heard that in big cities you're never more than two meters from a rat yeah I think that might be one of those um might be one of those urban urban myths and there's certainly um some CI that you're probably never more than a couple of feet from a rat but honestly I mean if you take a city like London city where I live um you've got sewers under the city you've got a very very old infrastructure um you've got restaurants and and waste outside for for rats to to feed on you wouldn't have to look too far to find rodent activity in in London or New York or Paris but but whether it's you know within a couple of meters I think that might be a bit of a stretch could you spend a bit more time on the climate what are the what are the main effects of climate on your business well I suppose to two Dimensions to that if if you think about it the first one is is the one I've touched on which is the environment um for pests and pest activity in a world where the planet is warming uh and the seasons are more unpredictable and and Summers tend to be hotter and the winters tend to wetter those are good um breeding conditions for certain types of particularly the insects the flying the biting the crawling insects so that does have a bearing on how soon in the season do we see see activity and how long do those Seasons go on for if you flip it round to a more positive um social side of the question in terms of sustainability today most solutions for Pest Control still require some element of chemical treatment and going forward that will not be the case we we're increasingly moving in a world of non-tox Sustainable Solutions chemical-free Solutions um ours is a business that has a lot of people driving around burning um carbon in their in their vehicles we're making changes in that uh Department as well so on the one side yes it's probably quotes net good uh for demand side of the industry on the other side we're a very responsible uh player very responsible company so like many other companies we're looking to the environment in which we operate say okay how can we do what we do which is a necessary service how can we do it in a way that has much less of an impact on the planet going forward the fact that you uh cannot use as much chemicals as you have done in the past does that make your job more difficult yeah I it's a good question it's a good question because in in Europe um it's the first part of the world where they put in place a ban on permanent baiting so historically what you would do a customer your your hotel for example that just called us in and we see okay we can't see any evidence of of rodent activity but to prevent them coming we would put down poisons well the European authorities say no no no no no you can't do that going forward you can only put down poisons once you have a problem it's quite an interesting change so so initially when the industry saw that this was going back a few years the industry said well this is this is this is not good you're going to have rodent problems everywhere because part of what we do is a preventative the prevention of the problem I think the reality is with those rule changes as they've come through it's forced companies like ourselves to become more innovative so we've come up with solutions that say okay if we can't put down permanent baiting and poison initially until there's a problem what else can we do so we've used Internet of Things connected devices we've used technology increasingly now we're using cameras um to identify the problem once you see a problem then you can put down the chemical Solutions we're also trying to come up with new Solutions which don't use chemicals at all being a bit lame here but why why can't you use uh permanent baiting well there there's two things one is is you know the European authorities and increasingly California authorities another one who who's looking at it um they're trying to reduce the amount of chemicals that we put into the planet generally so so there's a lot of chemicals going into the planet and and farm farms in particular use a huge quantity of chemical bait so so that's you know that that's the first thing and the second uh concern is one of secondary poisoning so there is a concern that uh if you put down um chemical poisons to indiscriminately not only will you kill the rats and the mice but you could end up damaging other Wildlife birds birds of prey for example that might feed on the uh feed on on the rodent so you know it's it's well intended and it's in it's um you know we don't oppose it but it does require Innovation and innovative solutions to come up with Alternatives which they're coming but in some cases they're not they're not there yet what um kind of emerging pest threats are you most concerned about now yeah I mean like I said you know the the pest have always been with us and probably always will be I think I think they go in phases certainly if we go back to the time of uh the Olympics in Brazil um zika was a massive concern and zika is is just one example of diseases which are born and spread by mosquitoes so I would say if you if you actually look and and go back in time um malaria is responsible for more deaths on the planet since the beginning of time than any other cause more than War more than disease more than cancer um so things like malaria right now Deni fever um is is significantly on the increase in markets like Brazil you see huge increases in Deni fever so I think Vector born diseases um remain a big concern and they you know they very serious consequences you can you know you can end up um dying or being very very sick from vectorn diseases um less dramatic but certainly more topical at the moment you've seen a lot of bed buuck activity in the news of course we got the Olympics um in in France in Paris this year and last year in particular there's a huge amount of media coverage about the the surge in bed bug activity is it real or is it because people want to have a go at the French oh I don't know about the second but but um look I think it's a bit of uh yes it is real there there is real significant um bed bug activity I think there's a little bit of media um hype in here as well I think we've had bed bugs in the big cities for quite some time um but but there's there's little doubt certainly the the number of inquire we've had from customers in the UK in France and callouts to deal with bed bugs is certainly significantly increased so it's a little bit difficult to say is that because the bed bugs are increasing or is it because of the awareness of the problem it's a little difficult to call that but you know that that'd be another another good example of of you know the increasing um intolerance of people to to pest activity what are some of the new technologies that you using yeah and look we are a really Innovative company and and we think Innovation is really the lifeblood of future growth and Internet of Things connected devices remote monitoring devices so these are think of it like um a burglar alarm for pests so you put down a a monitor and if uh in this case a rat or a mouse triggers the infrared beam we've got activity we know there's activity we can either send a message back to the organization you've got rodent activity and this is where it is or we can actually deal with the problem uh and kill the road in in situ so Internet of Things connected devices remote monitoring is the first wave of innovation we we brought through uh about 18 months ago we bought a a really exciting tech-based business out of Israel which is using the next generation of technology which is cameras camera based technology micro cameras that are in situ so not only can they see um the source of the problem the nature of the problem the extent and the scale of the problem but they can actually identify using facial recognition the identity of the Rat so they cannot just say it's it's three rats and this is the activity we've seen they can say it's rat number 12 rat number 17 and rat number 24 have come through this camera um 16 times in the last hour so you can actually track the behavior and if you can start to track behavior and you can mimic animal behavior you're far more effective and far more likely to be able to solve the problem so I'd say camerab based technology is is probably the next big thing in um identification of rodent problems and and insect problems well I have to say knowing one rat from the other uh it kind of uh takes it into a new level yeah it does I mean you can sit there and say yeah but what's the point I mean is it really that important that you know it's rat number three and rat number 13 but the fact that we can do it the fact that the technology can can do that it does start to give us new new insights Andy you are a really really impressive uh deal maker and um you make new deals pretty much every week uh buying companies and and building rent tole larger why why is this important yeah look I mean apart from the fact I love doing deals and that's that's part of my DNA um we do deals for I guess three reasons um the first one is it gives us density so as is as is a network business so the way to think about it if we've got I live in a little town in Kent and and if we've got say 10 customers in the High Street um we'll make a certain amount of money if we had 20 customers in the High Street we'd make a lot more money money and the reason is we're not then spending all of the time driving from one appointment to the next and to the next if you can minimize drive time windshield time therefore you maximize the amount of time that you're on customer site providing value added work so that's the first thing it's about density it's about shortening uh drive time and therefore it means instead of doing six visits a day maybe a technician can squeeze in another and do seven visits a day that gives you a much uh much greater gross margin so that's that's the first reason we do deals and a lot of our deals are are density deals um the second we call it the cities of the future and so if you look today I mean a statistic I never get tired of quoting is that 50% 50% half of the world's Pest Control takes place in the United States of America the other half of the world's Pest Control Tak takes place in all of the other countries and cities and towns added together it's a remarkable statistic well if we fast forward 50 years I don't think it's going to be 5050 the growth in the big cities and we talked about the importance of of urbanization but the growth in the big cities particularly in China in India in Brazil in Colombia there's there's a there's a lot of cities that in the next 10 20 30 40 50 years the growth in those cities is going to be very very significant so our our strategic model says hey look if we can identify the cities of the future and we can get into those cities now typically through acquisition and then we can build the density then in 10 20 30 40 years we're going to have a series of very very dense very very profitable powerful positions in the biggest cities in the world so that's the second reason we do deals is to try and pick those cities build early buy the best pest control business make it rent to kill the third reason we do deals is is capability and Technology I gave you an example a minute ago we bought that business in Israel sometimes we'll buy a company where they've already got the technology so th those are the three the three reasons what's the secret to making a good deal uh well yeah that's a that's a that's a big discussion as well isn't it let's just start I think first off strategic alignment you know I always always say you know you should be really really strategy is a big word but you know are you really clear um where you want to be which which markets you want to be which Services you want to offer which Industries you want to serve are you clear how you want to grow um if you've got a clear strategy and we've talked about you know cities of the future and we've talked about density building so that's the first thing is the potential acquisition on strategy or is it yeah is it a bit of a stretch is it a bit so that that's the first point um second I'd say look I'm a I'm a retired lawyer I know I was an m& lawyer as well and I would always say detail detail detail you know this is this is uh so critical that you do your due diligence you do your preparation you do your planning and it's thorough and you don't get seduced by the process a lot of people get halfway in oh yeah we found a problem that's all right we'll deal with it no no now you've got to be really disciplined and and be prepared to walk away if what you find is is not uh acceptable to you I do think Forward Thinking in terms of um negotiation um I always encourage my team to think like chess players try and think three steps ahead try and anticipate um the evolution of a negotiation what's likely to happen and to and to be able to do that you've really got to understand well what does the other side want to get out of this deal as well and I think that's that's a critical part if you want a successful negotiation too many people just work on well what do I want what do I need what am I prepared to pay you got to work out what the other side of the table is looking for are they looking for maximum price is it certainty is it speed is it what are they what what's important to them let's assume now so so now I assume I have Nicola tang and pest control company limited yeah and um you want to buy me now what is your best negotiation trick I I don't know about tricks I don't know about tricks Nikolai I mean I I I I used to be a pretty aggressive negotiator when I first started out um and this and I I learned some pretty um as I say aggressive approaches and I was you know I was quite a table Banger um are you are you have you become softer with age yeah I've become I'm mellowed and I'm chilled and I'm I'm a pussycat now so I'm much easier to deal with but I actually figured out along the way that being hard and tough and shouty isn't necessarily the best approach to getting the best out of out of a out of a negotiation what I would say in the way I do it I I won't pretend I'm the world's expert um I always say don't treat everyone the same don't don't assume that Nikolai is going to behave in this way or that way and don't make you know assumptions that he's Norwegian so he'll think like this or he's you know 50 whatever and he'll think like don't make assumptions about who you're dealing with understand them get to know them and then flex your negotiating style according to who you're dealing with and and some people respond differently to different styles and techniques but I I said I don't think it's a trick but but my view is if you're more prepared if you're more thorough if you're more detail oriented than the person that is on the other side of the table you should get the better of the negotiation you don't have to be difficult and shouty to do it um you just got to be prepared to to uh you know work at it I'd also say negotiating tricks or not be prepared to walk away you know the somebody once told me the best deal that you can do is to avoid a bad deal you know never be afraid to walk away even at late stage if the deal's not the right deal walk away so I think um you know those are important things I don't think they're necessarily tricks of the trade but uh um they they've sort of held me in pretty good stad and now you have bought me what's the key to integrating my company in the best possible way into racill I I would say the first thing and the most important thing is people and in in a business services it's it's all about people so the first thing we got to make make sure is before we even buy your business going to make sure that there is cultural alignment how's it going to work are you are we all going to be able to play nicely together are we going to respect each other are we going to listen to each other we're going to learn from each other uh or are you going to feel bent out of shape and your people are going to feel like they lost because they've been sold or are we going to behave inappropriately because we quotes one so the first for me is no no no you've got to get cultural alignment You' got to get people feeling really really good that this is a great thing then the second bit is really all about execution and and I learned that years ago that you know execution counts way more than strategy I think those are those are absolutely key and all of the time keeping one very very fixed eye on the people side and the culture so th those would be the things I guess we'd focus on I'd focus on you mentioned the importance of um of uh people here and this is an industry where there's quite a bit of uh turnover in uh amongst the people how do you how do you retain them yeah look I I I said um a minute ago for me I think the most important part of a business services business is is about people I'd say like the I've been CEO over 10 years now Ren been privileged to have that that role the first five years I think I focused on uh process I focused on cost I focused on structure I focused on uh innovation of getting out of bad businesses focused on acquisition the second five years of my ten year I've really focused on people and I think I was a bit late to to wake up to this one what made you wake up um oh quite honestly I was I was chatting to one of my guys um and you know we were doing well and we were making great progress and we had this conversation and I get a very open relationship with my team and and um he was giving me some feedback and um he said look Andy he said you know you're pretty good you know you're not bad you're doing all right we're doing all right he said but can I give you some advice I yeah of course he said well he said you play not to lose you you play it safe you play with inside yourself and and that's right I'm I'm a fear of failure guy I I don't want to screw up okay I don't want to mess up and that's that's been my you know that's that's deep in my DNA and his advice he said you know you should start playing to win and and stop playing not to lose which I thought was amazing advice considering this guy worked for me and it and it really resonated with me okay that is right actually you know that that we're doing well and we're making Pro we need to start playing we need to start making some more bold strokes and it was about that time that it occurred to me and looking at all of about numbers that the single biggest in abler of success in my business as people and your point about you know retention and churn um I said if only we could drive up colleague retention um then great things happen colleague retention goes up if you got happy engaged well-trained safe colleagues who come to work every day and do a great job for their customers then we get happy engaged customers who want to buy more stuff from us who are interested in our story our Innovation they'll pay our bills they'll give us cash and we reinvest that cash you got and you got 50,000 people you need to get out of bed every day right yeah 6 60 now 60,000 and how how do you how do you get them out of bed and how do you get them to come and be proud of what they do and and how do you motivate them I have to start very early and make a lot of phone calls yeah um look I think you know it is incredibly important um that whole cultural bit and I do take it very very seriously first off it's genuine and in our company you know people say what's it like at rent gu I said you know what it's a really nice company so it starts with this Bedrock that we do actually care about our people we do want them to thrive we do care about their safety so I'll give you an example um we put safety uh at the number one agenda item for every single meeting in the company without exception every single meeting starts with say and in the last well because for me on a personal level as a leader it's incredibly important I've got a background I used to work in explosives and my previous business um I had some fatalities on my watch um that still affect me today and I said NE you never again so in a people-based business in a root-based business with thousands of people driving working at height um being exposed to chemicals I've said the single most important thing in this business is our people are safe and everyone is authorized to walk off the job if you don't think this is safe walk off the job no one's ever going to criticize you so we put that agenda item number one 10 years ago changing um tax here um what makes you an effective leader well you have to you have to ask others as to whether I am an effective leader I suppose um I think look I'm not I I'm not a big uh quoter of of um sort of business books but I do remember reading uh Jack Welsh years and years ago when I went to business school and he said something like um if you want to be uh an effective business leader you should surround yourself with people who are better than you and then get out of the way and let them do their job and to a pretty large degree that's what I've always tried to do now that doesn't mean to say I'm not an interventionist manager the legal training that I've had means I do detail I'm not a micromanager but I do detail like nobody else in the company does detail so but but my notion is why would I try to be the best at marketing why would I try to be the best at sales or innovation or it or Finance I need worldclass people surrounding me I need to empower them and engage them and then I need to hold them to account so for me how can you do how can you do detail without being a micromanager yeah well well you can do detail I you know the question was about efficiency and I am a very very efficient um uh processor of materials I I I can read a document incredibly quickly and I can pick what I think are the the kernels that I need to get out of it but what I'm not trying to do is say okay I've read your report now do this now do that turn left turn right don't do that I've read the report I've got the key now I'm going to ask you a bunch of questions so my method of of management is not to tell you what to do now Nikolai my method of management is say okay I've listened to what you said here's a bunch of questions have you thought about this that combined with holding people to account in in Brent isue you get a lot of freedom you get a lot of entrepreneurial Freedom if you don't deliver you will be held to account that that's that's my method whether that makes me effective or efficient others can judge how do I get to the top of rill yeah um you have to you have to you have to move me out F first I guess um look I I think I look at my team I had my team together on Monday we've got huge tenure and longevity in my senior team and I think that is a tremendous compliment to the organization when you say long what do you mean by long what's a long tenure uh well my head of it has been doing it 32 years and I would I would rate him as one of the best it professionals I've ever worked with um I didn't I didn't think we had computers 32 years ago well I know it makes you wonder you know but but he's still up to speed with with AI and and Robotics and all the rest of it I've been here 15 years uh the finance director's been here 15 years the head of UK's been here 15 years the head of Europe's been here 14 years so quite a lot of of longevity now you could look at that and say well maybe that's too much maybe where's the where's the new blood where's well we have some new blood as well but I think people don't stay that length of time in an organization if certain good things AR aren't happening so for me comes back to something we touched on earlier culture is so so important and we have fun working at r we really do we enjoy each other's company we're high energy we're nice but we are very hard agged and I will say to the guys don't don't confuse neness with softness we're not not a soft organization we're a very hard-edged business driven performance-driven so I think how do you get to the top you know hard work application I would say be prepared to move you know be prepared to move roles be prepared to move countries be prepared to move cross divisions so keep learning and and um don't just stick in that one tram line for your entire career how hard do you work um my wife would tell you ridiculously hard um uh I think one of the things I've noticed over my career and technology is really part of this and I'm sure you're the same and many people listening would be the same I think the way in which we work is radically different now so I I'm I kind of I'm always on the the phone is always on um I run a global business so I'm getting emails and messages kind of 247 you know and and as I'm as I'm going to bed America's still firing and as I'm getting up at the morning Australia is not even yet you know back at the afternoon and and the way I cope with that is I I back to efficiency I just deal with the stuff when it comes in and that I think is you know that makes huge impositions on your lifestyle it means you know you're constantly on um and unfortunately for me that means if I go on holiday I'm still on um I'm very bad at at downtime it means that we weekends I'm still on but for me I found a way of making that work and sort of splitting my brain a little bit so I can get on and do the work stuff uh and still do all the other things I want to do um you know dayto day and in my life so I do resent it from time to time because it is a huge a huge imposition but it's also an amazing job I think being a CEO of any company is such a a privilege and such a an excit exciting job and such a varied job um so I feel you know I feel it's not right for me to point out yeah it's it's bloody hard work and and I work very very hard but you know how do you relax yeah um I I to I do a ton of I'm I'm in dry January at the moment so I won't say alcohol and that that wouldn't be the politically correct answer but I enjoy going out with family in particular I enjoy going out with friends I'm a massive sport night I'm a huge Chelsea football fan um I'm I have a house in Portugal and I love going out and spending time in the sun um you know I play some sport um but it's that sort of stuff it's it's family it's socializing it's sport um I'm not a I'm not an Avid Reader I find my my brain is already full by the end of the day because I've spent so much time reading stuff um I enjoy watching various you know things on TV and films I I got a busy life don't get me wrong I'm my my my life crams a lot of things in um so yeah I do find time to relax but but for me my special place is is Portugal and the algar that's that's where I feel I'm in a I'm in a different place that's if I can relax anywhere it's in the sunshine in Portugal favorite Portuguese dish ah frango P peri chicken Peri P hot spicy chicken sounds like a plan um Andy finally what is your advice to young people yeah that's another big question an important question um one bit of advice that I give when I talk internally into my uh colleagues here um I will say when the hits the fan you got a choice you can either take a step back avoid it or you can take a step forward and move towards it and what I mean by that is throughout our lives through throughout our careers in particular throughout our jobs there'll be many times where there's a situation that looks a bit messy that looks a bit complex that looks a bit scary and my advice is when you see those grasp them go towards them take that opportunity it will make your career more interesting It won't always work out perfectly but I think if your first instinct is to shy away from the complex the messy the difficult the challenge ing you never get to find out what the alternative is and and you know back to how do you get to the top most CEOs will tell you and I'm sure you'll be the same is we've all got the scars to show for the things we didn't get right the mistakes that we made the things that we screwed up the things that didn't go quite as well and I I do think I do encourage that bravery if you like and and experimentation uh for younger people go and have some fun with it what's the worst that can happen sort of thing so I think combination of having a plan and executing that plan and talking and asking for help but also that bit of bit of bravery and if if the hits the fan well don't worry about it Go and deal with it and and get stuck in um I've I've always felt that's that's Sound Advice um I I've certainly um got a lot out of it over the years in my career yeah well Andre you for sure have taken a little opportunities and um big thanks for keeping our cities uh safe and clean and uh you know nicer than they would have been without rent to kill and also big thanks for being on today really great to you absolute pleasure lovely see you Nikolai I'll see you again and uh thanks for the opportunity
