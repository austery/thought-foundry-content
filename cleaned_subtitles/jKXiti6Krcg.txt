Henley & Partners publish their Private Wealth 
Migration Report once a year. In their latest  
edition, the UK ranks dead last — for the 
first time — with a net outflow of 16,500  
millionaires. This figure has been quoted 
in Parliament, picked up by newspapers,  
and used to frame debates about Britain’s 
global competitiveness. It’s a very worrying  
number - but It’s also quite hard to verify.
Tim Harford looked into this claim on his BBC  
podcast More or Less. He interviewed the head 
of research at New World Wealth, who did the  
research underlying the migration report – who 
explained that their estimates rely on social  
media profiles, press coverage, and company 
filings. Hartford argued in his podcast – quite  
rightly - that their sample was not representative 
and that you couldn’t draw conclusions from it… 
 
Dan Neidle – of Tax Policy Associates - went 
further - in a forensic review published on  
his website he pointed out that the report 
was riddled with statistical red flags.  
The firm had dropped all property wealth 
from its analysis between 2023 and 2025,  
yet its millionaire counts barely moved — a result 
Neidle described as “impossible” if the published  
methodology were real. New World Wealth later 
told the FT that they hadn’t actually changed  
their methodology – just their description of it.
Neidle found digit patterns in the data with a  
suspiciously high frequency of even numbers and 
numbers where trailing digits cluster on 0s and  
5s, with almost no 1s. Statistically – he points 
out - the chance of that occurring naturally is  
about 1 in 240,000. More evidence – he says - 
that the numbers were either manually created  
or manually adjusted. Neidle’s analysis used 
well-established techniques to detect rigged  
numbers. I will put a link to his more 
detailed analysis in the description – but  
he concluded – that the figures were 
likely engineered rather than observed.
 
Now this doesn’t mean that the rich are not 
leaving the UK – it just means that it is  
very difficult to know whether they are or not 
- simply because good data doesn’t exist. To  
highlight the difficulty - the UK Office for 
Statistics Regulation recently suspended the  
official statistics status of the governments own 
Wealth and Assets Survey collected by the Office  
for National Statistics following concerns 
raised by the ONS that the data is no longer  
of sufficient quality to meet users’ needs.”
The Financial Times in a separate analysis - found  
that a wave of company directors have left 
Britain since the government abolished its  
favorable tax treatment for non-domiciled 
residents and raised other duties on the  
wealthy. They analyzed Companies House filings, 
looking for directors of UK firms who’ve updated  
their addresses to overseas jurisdictions. This 
is not perfect methodology either – which the FT  
highlighted in their column - as plenty 
of wealthy people don’t run companies,  
and plenty of directors don’t update their 
filings in a timely manner. But a trend is  
visible in the data. In the most recent period, 
3,790 directors reported leaving the UK, up from  
2,712 the year before – and a spike that occurred 
in April coincides with the new tax changes.
 
There are other signals being reported too. 
Butler agencies report fewer placements. Wealth  
managers say some clients are leaving and London’s 
luxury property market has softened. None of this  
is conclusive. But it’s not nothing either.
The UK’s non-dom tax regime is not a recent  
invention. It dates back to the very first 
income tax in 1799, introduced by William Pitt  
the Younger to fund the Napoleonic Wars. At the 
time, all residents were taxed only on UK income.  
In 1915, the rules changed: UK residents were 
taxed on worldwide income — unless they could  
claim non-domiciled status – and that carve-out 
remained largely intact for over a century.
 
"Non-dom" describes a UK resident whose permanent 
home for tax purposes is outside the UK. Domicile  
under British tax law has always been a bit of 
a funny thing it’s the place they consider to  
be their permanent home and where they have the 
closest ties and it refers to their tax status,  
and doesn’t necessarily relate to their, 
citizenship or resident status - although  
it can be affected by these factors.
Before we dig into how this system  
worked let me tell you about this 
week’s video sponsor deleteme.
 
A non-dom only paid UK tax on 
the money they earned in the UK.  
They didn’t have to pay tax to the UK government 
on money made elsewhere in the world - unless  
they transfer that money back into the UK.
For wealthy individuals, this presented the  
opportunity for significant - and entirely 
legal – tax savings – especially if you could  
claim a lower-tax country as your domicile.
One of the best known non-doms was former Prime  
Minister Rishi Sunak's wife – who after a scandal 
broke a few years ago – announced that she would  
start paying UK tax on her worldwide income.
Attempts to reform the non-dom rules over the  
years were frequent. Labour nearly abolished it 
in 1974. Nigel Lawson tried again in 1988. During  
the financial crisis - the regime was tightened 
in 2008 – where annual charges were introduced  
for long-term non-doms — you had to pay £30,000 a 
year if you had been resident in the UK for seven  
of the past nine years, and £60,000 a year if you 
had been resident for twelve of the past fourteen  
years. The remittance basis was preserved, but 
access became more expensive and conditional.
 
George Osborne made further changes in 2017, 
removing benefits for those who had lived in the  
UK for fifteen of the past twenty years. But each 
time adjustments were made, Treasury officials  
warned of tax flight, and ministers backed down. 
The fear was that driving the wealthy abroad  
would harm the economy more than it would benefit 
from taxing them on their foreign earned income.
 
In March 2024, then-Chancellor Jeremy Hunt 
announced the abolition of the non dom rule  
ahead of the general elections. In October, 
Labour Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed the  
policy’s end, extending it to offshore trusts 
to prevent inheritance tax avoidance.
 
Now, foreign income and gains are taxed in the 
UK - as they are earned - once an individual has  
been resident in the UK for four years. On top 
of that, inheritance tax will apply to worldwide  
assets after ten years, and continue for ten 
years after departure. The excluded property  
trust loophole is closed and the concept of 
domicile for tax purposes has been retired.
 
There are transitional rules. Assets held 
before April 2025 can be rebased. Foreign  
income and gains can be brought into the UK 
at a flat 12% rate for a limited time. New  
arrivals get a four-year grace period under 
the “Qualifying New Resident” regime. But  
the overall direction is clear: the UK is no 
longer a tax haven for the globally mobile.
 
The Office for Budget Responsibility say that 
they expect up to 25% of non-doms to leave the  
UK. The Treasury forecasts £12.7 billion pounds 
in revenue over five years. Research from Warwick  
University suggests the fears of mass departure 
may be overstated – as when Osborne’s 2017 change  
took effect, only 6% of affected non-doms left 
the UK. Those who stayed paid significantly more  
tax — on average, an extra £100,000 pounds per 
year and the predicted mass exodus never came.
 
The debate is still not over – this June - 
the Financial Times reported that Chancellor  
Rachel Reeves was exploring a partial 
reversal of the inheritance tax changes,  
following lobbying from the City of London and a 
spate of high-profile departures. The government  
is said to be considering adjustments to 
the ten-year tail or reintroducing trust  
protections. No formal announcement has been made, 
but the Treasury is watching the fallout closely.
 
There are signs that some of the rich are leaving 
- London’s luxury property market has softened –  
in particular in the neighborhoods where wealthy 
foreigners tend to live. Butler agencies report  
fewer placements. Wealth managers say some 
clients are leaving. Recruiters in Mayfair  
and Belgravia are seeing fewer inquiries 
from ultra-high-net-worth individuals.  
Private club memberships are down. Some of 
the big family offices have quietly shifted  
operations to Switzerland and the UAE.
The VAT change on private school fees  
has added to the mood. From January 2025, 
independent schools are subject to 20% VAT.  
The government expects a 10% average fee 
increase and up to 35,000 pupils to shift  
to state schools. For wealthy families already 
considering relocation, it’s one more nudge.
 
There have been a number of high-profile 
exits. Lakshmi Mittal the Indian born  
founder of Arcelor Mittal and Britain’s seventh 
wealthiest man is reported to be leaving as is  
Nassef Sawiris’ - Egypt’s richest person. Richard 
Gnodde – the South African born vice chairman of  
Goldman Sachs International has left Britain 
for Milan. Anne Beaufour, the Sanofi heiress,  
moved her tax residence to Switzerland. 
A study of non-doms in 2018 — and those who  
had claimed the status since 1997 — found 
that more than 93% were born abroad,  
and another 4% had lived abroad for a substantial 
period. Most have genuine international ties. When  
the UK changes the rules, these people have real 
ties abroad and can choose lower tax regimes.
 
A paper from the London School of Economics 
on Tax Flight points out that people who  
have already migrated once - tend to 
be more responsive than natives to tax  
changes and there is often a statistically 
significant migration response overall.
 
None of this proves a mass departure. But it’s not 
just noise either. HMRC payroll data this August  
found no evidence to suggest that more non-doms 
left Britain than the 25% official prediction,  
according to the Financial Times.
Countries around the world are  
constantly adjusting their tax regimes. Some 
are tightening rules. Others are designing  
systems to attract wealthy individuals.
Switzerland offers lump-sum taxation to high  
net worth individuals where a flat tax rate can 
be negotiated with local government authorities.  
Italy introduced a one hundred thousand euro flat 
tax on foreign income in 2017, later raising it to  
two hundred thousand euros. This has been popular 
with footballers, fashion executives, and hedge  
fund managers. Portugal replaced its Non-Habitual 
Resident regime in 2024 with a narrower scheme  
focused on innovation and research. The UAE has no 
personal income tax and a 9% corporate tax above a  
million dollars. Andorra offers a 10% income 
tax, no wealth tax, and no inheritance tax.
 
Golden visas are part of the strategy too. The UAE 
offers long-term residency to investors. Italy and  
Greece have property-linked visa schemes. Donald 
Trump recently proposed a $5 million dollar “Gold  
Card” visa for the US — a rebranding of the EB-5 
Immigrant Investor Visa with fewer restrictions.
 
To highlight how complicated some of this can 
be – last month, several senior bankers from  
Pictet — one of Switzerland’s most prestigious 
private banks — relocated to Italy where they  
could get lower taxes. The move triggered a tax 
debate in Geneva. A point of contention is that  
some foreigners in Switzerland pay less tax than 
citizens. Critics argued that Switzerland’s rigid  
enforcement was pushing talent away, while 
Italy’s flat-tax regime was pulling it in.
 
Tax is only part of the equation. Wealthy 
individuals also consider lifestyle,  
legal stability, and access to global 
markets. Jurisdictions that offer the right  
mix attract the rich while others lose them.
Gabriel Zucman, the French economist known  
for his work on tax havens and inequality, has 
proposed a 2% annual wealth tax on billionaires.  
The idea gained traction in France’s political 
circles earlier this year, with support from  
parts of the left and criticism from business 
leaders and economists across the spectrum.
 
Zucman argues that the ultra-wealthy are 
undertaxed relative to their income and  
assets. His proposal is designed to be enforceable 
through international cooperation and automatic  
exchange of financial information. He’s also 
advising the G20 on global wealth taxation,  
pushing for a coordinated approach 
that would prevent capital flight.
 
France has a history with wealth taxes. It 
repealed its own version in 2017 after years  
of debate over its effectiveness. The tax raised 
modest revenue and was blamed for driving wealthy  
residents to Belgium, Switzerland, and the UK. 
The debate over how taxes should work has  
spilled across borders. The former French 
Prime minister, recently accused Italy of  
engaging in “fiscal dumping” by luring wealthy 
French citizens with its flat-tax regime.  
The Pictet bankers’ move from Geneva to Milan 
has sparked fierce debate in Switzerland.
 
Wealth taxes are politically popular 
but economically fragile. According  
to Economics Observatory the number of 
OECD countries with annual wealth taxes  
dropped from 12 in 1990 to just 3 today. The 
reasons for dropping them are consistent:  
low yield, high avoidance, and 
administrative complexity. 
 
Mobility is no longer limited to billionaires. 
Increasingly, professionals in the upper-middle  
class are making decisions about 
where to live based on tax, lifestyle,  
and legal stability. The barriers to relocation 
have dropped. Remote work, international schools,  
and digital infrastructure have made it easier 
to live abroad without severing ties to home.
 
In the United States, internal migration reflects 
similar patterns. States like Florida, Texas,  
and Tennessee — which have no state income tax — 
continue to attract high earners from California,  
New York, and Illinois. The shift isn’t just 
about tax. It’s also about housing costs,  
crime rates, and the quality of public services.
Digital nomad visas have added another layer.  
Estonia, Portugal, and Barbados offer residency to 
remote workers earning above a certain threshold.  
These programmes target professionals who 
aren’t wealthy in the traditional sense but  
have portable incomes and flexible careers.
Citizenship planning has become a cottage  
industry. Wealthy families 
now hold multiple passports,  
not for travel convenience but for legal and 
financial flexibility. Some jurisdictions offer  
“Plan B” citizenships — second passports designed 
to hedge against political or fiscal instability.
 
The wealthy have always been mobile. What’s 
changed is the scale. Mobility now extends to a  
broader segment of the population, and governments 
are adjusting their policies accordingly.
 
Governments are starting to run out of 
room. Across Europe, deficits are widening,  
and the cost of borrowing is no longer trivial. 
The post-pandemic debt pile hasn’t shrunk;  
it’s instead been layered with new obligations 
— energy subsidies, inflation-linked benefits,  
and now, military spending. Ageing 
populations combined with high  
retirement benefits aren’t helping either.
Governments need to either raise taxes or  
cut spending – and there appears to be no 
desire to cut spending. Tax revenue has to  
come from somewhere. But the traditional targets — 
consumption, corporate profits, and middle-income  
earners — are already strained. 
This is the tension:  
fiscal sustainability demands revenue while 
global competitiveness demands restraint. The  
balance is hard to strike — and easy to lose.
In the 1970s, Britain raised its top marginal  
tax rate to 83%, and 98% on unearned income — 
which means investment income and royalties.  
The response was quick. The Beatles — whose 
music publishing income would have been  
classified as unearned income — shifted their 
financial operations offshore. The Rolling  
Stones left for France. Film stars, bankers, 
and industrialists followed. Sotheby’s held  
auctions on heirlooms from shuttered 
estates. Stately homes emptied out.
 
The tax code became a deterrent. 
High earners who could move did.
 
Today, the top rate of income tax 
in the UK on most income is 45%,  
so you would expect that there must have been 
a lot more income tax paid in the 1970s than  
today. But this chart from Tax Policy Associates 
shows that income tax raised about the same in the  
1970s (as a percentage of GDP) as it does today.
The rich didn’t end up paying a higher percentage  
of taxes back then either. When taxes 
were at their highest in 1978 and 1979,  
the top 1% paid 11% of all income tax 
collected. Today in the UK, the top 1% will pay  
about 29% of all income tax collected.
There are a few reasons for that. Firstly,  
the top 1% today earn a lot more than the top 1% 
did in the late ’70s. The nature of how money is  
made today — where technology can be leveraged to 
build scalable income — means that income is less  
tied to “hours worked” than it was in the past.
Secondly, in the wake of the financial crisis,  
tax rates went up a lot for high earners.
Thirdly, and possibly most importantly,  
high earners are often in a position where 
they can control the size of their incomes  
and the timing of payments. While the Beatles 
and the Rolling Stones couldn’t slow down their  
royalty payments, a business owner or senior 
executive could defer payments — waiting for  
a better tax rate. Why would you pay yourself a 
high dividend if the government would take 98%  
of it? You would just leave it in the company.
In the 1970s, benefits in kind were undertaxed or  
completely untaxed. An executive could eat out, 
have a company car, take holidays, and enjoy  
club memberships — all without being taxed.
As Dan Neidle explains in his blog, the UK tax  
policies of the 1970s were a failure. They failed 
to tax the rich effectively, they failed to fix  
the government’s fiscal problems, and they drove 
many wealthy Brits abroad — who never came back.
 
The 1970s are remembered for strikes 
and stagflation. But they also marked  
a turning point in how Britain treated globally 
mobile wealth. When the cost of staying rises,  
those with options start looking elsewhere.
Those calling for a return to those types of  
policy are often doing so out of a desire to 
punish high earners. According to Dan Neidle,  
the lessons that can be drawn from that era are 
that the best way to tax the wealthy is to expand  
the base and close loopholes. While that makes a 
less snappy soundbite than sending rates sky-high,  
the evidence and the history show that 
it’s fairer and much more effective.
 
The debate around wealth inequality often starts 
with a statistic and ends with a slogan. Oxfam’s  
claim that “the richest 1% own more than the rest 
of the world combined” gets repeated frequently  
— but the methodology behind it is rarely 
examined. The figure includes negative net worth,  
which means a recent medical school graduate 
with student debt is counted as poorer than a  
homeless person — with no debt, but no employment 
prospects. That’s not a meaningful comparison.
 
Another example: Jerome Kerviel, the rogue 
trader who lost billions for Société Générale,  
is technically one of the poorest people 
in the world by net worth. His debts are  
so large they skew the data. But he’s 
not representative of global poverty.
 
In the UK, the top 1% pay around 29% of all income 
tax. That share has risen over time, not fallen.  
The idea that the wealthy aren’t contributing is 
popular — but it’s not supported by the numbers.
 
Inequality exists, but the shape of it is 
more complex than the headlines suggest.  
Many of those counted as “wealthy” are 
business owners with volatile income,  
or professionals with high earnings but 
limited assets. Where you live matters  
too - you can probably live more comfortably on 
fifty thousand dollars a year in Texas than on  
a hundred thousand dollars a year in California — 
where everything costs a lot more. Many of those  
counted in broad based statistics as being “poor” 
are young, educated, and on upward trajectories.
 
According to research from the Institute for 
Fiscal Studies, high earners in the UK are not  
a stable group — a quarter of those in the top 
1% in one year will not be there the next. After  
five years, only half will still be in the top 
1%. Research from Cornell University shows that  
about 11 percent of American workers will move 
into the top 1 percent of income earners for at  
least a year between the ages of 25 and 60.
Hopefully you can see that the data is a bit  
more complicated than it first appears — 
and you need to look past the headlines  
and slogans to see what’s going on.
Whether the rich are leaving the UK or  
not in meaningful numbers is hard to pin 
down based on the available data it will  
take some time to work that out.
But the bigger issue is whether  
people — especially those with options 
— feel they’re getting value for money.
 
Tax isn’t just about rates. It’s about trust. 
In Sweden, high taxes are tolerated because  
the system is transparent, the institutions 
are trusted, and the public services work.  
Civil servants disclose their financial interests 
and one phone call will get you your lawmaker's  
tax statements. That kind of openness builds 
legitimacy — and with it, compliance.
 
In the UK and the US, trust in government 
is lower. Tax systems are more complex.  
And when people feel their money is wasted or 
mismanaged, they start looking for the exit.
 
There’s no perfect formula. 
But history offers clues,  
and the international landscape offers 
comparisons. The challenge is to tax fairly,  
fund public services, and remain globally 
competitive — all at the same time.
