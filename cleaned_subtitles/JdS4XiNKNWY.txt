Sometimes we tend to make people
part of the problem only,
but we don't make people
part of the success.
We're quick to say,
"These were my challenges,"
but we're not quick to say,
"But this person removed this barrier
and this person removed this one."
We need to start telling those stories.
My name is Refilwe Ledwaba.
I’m a helicopter and airplane pilot.
I'm also an educator.
I'm a founder of Girls Fly Africa,
an organization that is teaching
the next generation of young people,
especially women, to learn how to fly.
I started as an air hostess
and then transitioned
into a helicopter pilot,
then an airplane pilot for an airline,
and then a flight instructor.
I was the first Black woman
in South Africa
to actually fly helicopters.
When I was still a cabin attendant,
some of the pilots used to come to me
and they’re like, “You’re so smart,
you should be flying the airplane.”
They would call me during landings,
you know, during take-offs.
And I remember the captain,
he actually looked at me, like,
"Can you see what you're missing?"
I’m like, “This is awesome!
This is what I want to do.”
That was the turning point
where I actually started taking seriously
that this is something
that I really wanted to do
because it was beautiful.
But I had major challenges along the way.
When I was training as a helicopter pilot,
I had difficulty with a maneuver
called hovering.
It is a highly coordinated maneuver.
The helicopter will move
from one corner to the other
because I'll put like one hand
and then one hand,
and it just didn't click.
And I was really on the verge
of being let go from the program.
At that point,
they changed the instructor.
My new instructor actually
took some time to get to know me.
He asked me my background, how I grew up,
what are some
of the activities that I did.
Because at that point
I didn't have a driver's license,
so I’ve never driven a car,
I didn't have a bike
when I was growing up.
The people that normally
come to flight school,
they have much more
developed motor skills.
He understood that traditional training
wasn't going to work for me.
He sort of went back
and redesigned the program.
And I mean, within two flights
of just doing that,
I overcame that obstacle
and I went on to finish
ahead of everybody else.
He actually didn't have to do what he did.
It wasn't part of the syllabus,
just to go out of his way to assist me.
The way he looked at context,
which is something
that people don't think about,
that inspired me
to become an instructor as well,
and perhaps do what he did
for other people,
recognizing that
there's a whole lot of people
that are coming from, you know,
similar background that I did,
that will probably struggle
as much as I did.
Girls Fly Africa inspires young people,
especially young women,
to learn how to fly.
Most of our students,
they come from rural areas
that have never been exposed
to the industry,
and our program is set up in a way
that it kind of looks at
what are some of the challenges
they might encounter.
We identify five areas.
The first area was most of them
don't have information, just like me.
I knew about only Tom Cruise,
and he certainly didn't look like me
so they don't have role models.
Not role models to them,
but to the communities as well,
because most of the communities
that we work with,
they still have preconceived ideas
of what women should be doing.
We'll go and land in those areas,
and so they will see us
coming out of the airplane.
Now they can see some people
that look like them
that have actually flown in.
One of the first few people
in the program,
we actually landed at her school,
and I remember she ran to the helicopter,
like, when I landed
and she came and she spoke to us,
and she's like, "Oh, wow."
Can she take our numbers?
And then she attended our camps
and, you know, some of our programs.
And then we assisted her.
And today she's an aeronautical engineer.
The second thing that we did,
we needed to build
skills and capabilities.
Like, for example,
we'll put them in a simulator
before they can even start flying.
We have engines that we can show them.
They can work on those engines.
Now they have a clear idea
of what an engine looks like
before they can even start training.
We've got programs that expose them to 3D
where they build rockets,
they build airplanes using 3D models.
And then the third phase,
most of these young people
come from backgrounds
where they can't afford to go and fly.
It's too expensive.
Like, if I had to tell my mother
that she had to pay for my flying,
she was probably going to smile
and, "Yeah, right."
Because it's the same amount as a house.
Through our scholarship program,
we’ve been able to train 100-plus pilots,
drone pilots, flight instructors.
The fourth phase is networks.
Most of these young people,
after they get trained,
there's not a job waiting for them.
We sort of advocate for them.
We connect them with those job prospects
so they can be able to build hours
to be able to go into the airline.
And then the last phase
is the continuous support.
We believe that true empowerment
is when they are at the top of their game,
so they need to become
training captains one day,
you know, they need to become astronauts,
not just study their degree and that's it.
So they need to progress.
So we create that network
for continuous growth for them.
So we have interacted with more
than half a million boys and girls,
and then about 200,000
have gone through our programs.
That will mean the workshops,
simulator workshops.
And we've got five-day camps.
And then in terms of the training
of the girls that we've supported
or partnered with multiple organizations
for them to get trained,
it's about 100, more than 100 girls.
It looks like a small number,
but to train a pilot, it takes quite long.
The young people that are coming after me,
they've got different challenges.
But I've always said to them,
go back and look at how many people
have actually helped you.
You will find out that
more than 90 percent of the people,
they actually want you to succeed.
It's just that a lot of times
we tend to maybe dwell on the negatives
and we don't actually
highlight the positives.
I had a community of people
that were behind me:
my mum, all the pilots that called me,
"You should be in front,"
kind of nudging me,
my instructor, all of them were like,
"You can do this, you can do this."
They've inspired me
and they've made it normal
to do for others what they did for me.
I think for me,
that's the most rewarding part.
