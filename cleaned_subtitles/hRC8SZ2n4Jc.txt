[Music] hi everyone I'm Nicola tangin the CEO of the Norwegian so wealth fund and today we are thrilled to be joined by Aden fredman CEO of nastac now Adina transformed NASDAQ into a Global Tech Powerhouse and she's now one of the most influential leaders in global Finance so ad welcome well it's great to be here thank you so much n and welcome to NASDAQ well exactly because I'm visiting you so I'm sitting here with a NASDAQ mug you know I'm feeling uh kind of part of something pretty pretty big but um we you start with the basic here so what is NASDAQ sure well nasac of course is a world-class Market operator and we're extremely extremely proud of that Foundation yeah but as you know we have expanded our business to become a global technology provider to the financial industry and we focused on expanding our business in three key pillars and they all are kind of form the foundation of a good market so we've got our liquidity pillar transparency and integrity and if you think about it you need all three of those things to make for a worldclass capital Market but as we've kind of become a technology provider and partner to our clients we've used those themes to really expand our business on the cup I had here um it says NASDAQ rewrite tomorrow so what is tomorrow going to look like for Nasdaq well tomorrow it we are now we're going from a market operator to a technology partner and over time we want to become kind of what I would call an ecosystem partner to the world's Capital markets and the financial system so our vision is to be the trusted fabric to the world's Financial system and that really does mean that we are not only here just to be a software provider to our clients but to help them solve their problems in a more material ways how do we drive from delivering software to delivering a a market ecosystem that makes the capital markets around the world more efficient and effective how do we come become that risk management partner that really drives the banks to be higher Integrity as well as more efficient so they can drive more liquidity into the markets those are the types of things that we think about as we expand the business you say that you wanted to be a trusted partner and you for sure are trusted by some very big companies right because is the five biggest companies in the world are listed on NQ the seven but yeah the seven hey so you know you want to buy shares in apple Microsoft Amazon alphabet you basically do it on ndaq but you also have a lot of people in Sweden how come how come yes in fact we own and operate the markets in the nordics other than Norway um so Sweden Denmark Finland Iceland and the three Baltic countries we own and operate those markets and we also have a market technology business where we provide technology to the world's market so 130 markets um rely on us for their technology to run them to run their markets and that's also operated out of Sweden why haven't you go Norway uh that you know we wanted to have Norway you probably remember well uh we decided to take a friendly approach with the Norwegian exchange and unfortunately there was another exchange operator that tried to take a less friendly approach and they unfortunately won but we did try very hard to come in as a friendly as a friendly partner to The noran Exchange does each country need a so exchange it's a good question um I would say that each country wants its own exchange and it's important to recognize when you're forming a country there are a few key pillars that really underpin building a country you've got roads and transportation you've got education um and you have you have airports and things to make it so people can come in and out of the country but you also have to have an economy and when you look at the economy of a country it's really underpinned by the central bank and the exchange operator and then the banking system and exchanges are kind of a critical pillar and they become kind of a national icon to a country now does every country need to have its own exchange I would say in today's modern Capital markets you know Capital flows are Global money moves moves seemlessly around the world but there are very local elements to exchanges where they appeal to local innovators local market participants local investors and so there is a benefit to having a country have its exchange but having it connected into a global ecosystem to to allow for more Capital flows is what we think is the the future of markets some people are moving the listings right so instead of being listed in in London for instance they won't be listed in the US because they think they get better valuations how how does this work what is driving these differences in valuation between countries well I think first of all having a listing in multiple countries has been a part of the markets for quite some time the ADR prob American depository receipt or the gdr gdr which is a global depository receipt I mean those are contracts that have allowed companies from other countries to go and put a a second listing into a different country but more and more what we're finding is it's not so much the ADR that's coming but the primary listing is moving and I think the reason why you're seeing companies choose from outside the United States choose to move their primary listing to the United States is really because today the the United States the markets are extremely liquid they're the most liquid in the world we have the most Diversified investor base in the world so you have a really healthy retail ecosystem in addition to an Institutional ecosystem in addition to let's say hedge fund community and other you know other players that really Drive Market liquidity and that allows companies to raise capit more efficiently and we also have kind of a research ecosystem that allows investors to understand these companies more deeply which then gives them more confidence to invest and all of that is not by accident I mean that's been you know the contract of the United States in terms of all the work we've done to develop our markets um and The Innovation ecosystem is now playing to our benefit I would point though to Sweden as being an anomalous and very very positive story in Europe um and I really mean that and there's some great there's some great um um anecdotes it's all uh they got great this is an amazing amazing startup ecosystem great Innovation culture and a great Equity Culture by their by their um their citizens so I was looking at the data and 37% of people in Sweden have direct retail accounts um for equities for domestic equities and so if you think about how empowerful that is inside an economy where you have retail then you have a great pension system and they deploy Capital into the market then you have Global flows you know Global players who come in and participate in that market because we have a great market system and you also have these tax advantage savings accounts that encourage the citizenship to get involved in retail I mean in in invest in investing in equities and all of that creates a combustion that again creates a really great Market ecosystem in Sweden so it's possible to do this in countries outside the United States for sure but it's a it's a lot of ingredients that have to come together to create the right recipe if I start up a company and it gets really big are you going to call me and I'll whether I want to list on NASDAQ well is that how it works I would say that if you start a company and it doesn't have to get really big we will call you up and ask if you want to list on NASDAQ so we list companies of all sizes on NASDAQ and we're very happy to have a startup come and earlier in their life and choose to make their their stock available to you know everyday consumers and everyday uh retail investors and then grow up as a company like you know when Amazon went public many you know a couple decades ago they were worth $300 million and they've grown up as a public company and done remarkably well in the public market do all exchanges try to steal them away from you um you know it used to be that there was kind of a a view that nasac was the home to smaller companies but today nasc is home to the largest companies in the world and and what happened was these companies would come to NASDAQ as small companies but then they'd stay 52 years later we are now the home we have $3 trillion of market cap listed on NASDAQ and we are home to both the the largest companies in the world I would say that we're 30 trillion so and New York Stock Exchange somewhere right around that so we're almost equal you know they're we are really neck and neck now for um the market cap of the listed companies list on NASDAQ versus New York and the fact is that once they got to NASDAQ we gave them a home when frankly at the time because we were formed in 1971 and at the time New York had rules that didn't allow these companies to list there so we started as a tech innovator in our space we democratized access to the capital markets for retail and we actually had listing rules that allowed young Innovative companies to come before they were profitable and that was a change in Paradigm in the United States they came so the first class of companies that come to nzq Comcast Applied Materials Intel and and then a really cool truck building company called packar th that was the first class and they're still here they're all in the azac 100 and then we of course attracted Microsoft and Apple and those companies came and then they stayed because they realized that we gave them a home we gave them great service we gave them a great market and and since then we've also become great partners to them from a technological perspective at the same time um there are more private companies than before now um it's partly because of private Equity but it's also because many companies um choose to to stay private so why should companies go public and have a listing instead of being private well I think we could have a really good engage discussion about this Nikolai as a large asset owner yourself as to how do you look at asset allocation across private and public and how do you think about the public markets and what you're trying to achieve in the public markets versus the private markets but I think that there are structural in cyclical reasons why the the public markets are more or less attractive to companies yeah but uh cyclically of course it's just a matter of are public investors ready to underwrite risk in a time when you have changing interest rate environment like we're having right now but more structurally it's the question is are is the burden of being a public company such that it makes it so that it becomes more attractive to remain private and that's where we have to work with the government to think about the balance of the regulatory balance between the responsibility of being a public company and making your stock available to Everyday consumers and everyday retail investors but also the the the ability for you to continue to drive your strategy change you know and make changes and and continue to progress in a way that is still attractive to to institutional um investors will you also make money on private companies at some stage you think so we actually are involved in private markets today in two ways the first is nasc private Market which allows for private companies to seek liquidity periodic liquidity in their stock so we can buy and sell companies even though they're not listed on a exchange that's correct but you have to be a qualified buyer or an Institutional buyer so there you know it's a limited number of um investors who are have that available to them and then also we support the asset manager and asset owner ecosystem but with our tool called investment where we allow for asset owners to make smart asset allocation Decisions by seeking out the asset you know the asset managers that they find most attractive both public and private and so we do get involved in the private markets in in those ways now there's been a trend over the last years um towards high frequency trading right so extremely uh frequent trading you know measure it in Nan seconds uh we do I suspect I I I I read that the light travels only 30 m in a nanc so pretty uh pretty short period um now how does this um how does this high frequency trading work yeah is it good for you is it good for you I mean I would say that it's good for the system so I will say it that way because what we look for with high frequency trading firms they really are the modern market makers they're committing Capital into the market and even if they're committing Capital into the market for a very short period of time they are there to make it so that any given time you as an as an asset owner or any asset manager or any retail investor can come in and put an order in the market and get it executed instantaneously at any time and there's price Discovery all the time meaning there's always a bit offer spread available stock so you know exactly what you can where you can buy it and sell it at what price that's what the high frequency firms provide to markets all over the world and while they are doing it in in very small increments and they're doing it in very short periods of time they are there constantly to be that liquidity provider so they provide an important service and at the same time they make money so you know of course they're going to make money in terms of very small tickets and and kind of the the differences in the spread as well as making it so that they're taking risk and they're getting rewarded for taking risk something called Dark pools how do you work with them so the dark pools actually compete with the lit markets yeah so that's a little bit different right so I would say that they bad news well for you okay so the financial industry we think they are good news yeah well the financial industry is a world of coopertition yeah so I just need to say that like there's no black there's no kind of bright lines here it's really a matter of finding ways to work with everyone in the context and and basically working with our clients where they are y so for dark pools NASDAQ does compete for order flow from dark pools but we also provide technology to dark pools so we actually do provide our trading systems and make those available to dark pools if they want to partner with us and we will actually operate those dark pools on their behalf as a technology provider but at the same time we will compete with them to try to get the order flow onto the lit markets now in the US and in Europe so in the Europe I would say about 50% of the trading in Europe occurs in dark pools and internalizers and the same almost the same in the US it's about 45% of the trading occurs in dark pools and in internalizers so in a dark pool you don't really see who the buyer and the set is I mean that's the challenge is that if you're an investor and you want to understand what's the best price to buy and sell my stock the dark pools don't contribute to that information because they're everything's happening in the dark that's why they're called Dark PS and you have to be a very sophisticated investor to gain access to them so we think that it's important to make sure you're at least creating a competitive playing field that allows the lit venues to compete on an equal basis with the dark pools to make it so we can we can be the first place that you want to place that order and not into the dark the fact that there is so much concentration in the market now you know a few companies account for a huge proportion of the value of the so exchange is that a is that a worry um I mean I would have to say that's just the nature of the economy as it's kind of been progressing right you have these huge companies that have really defined the future of our economy really in terms of the technological innovation that they're underwriting the risk they're taking the scale that they're providing to really under pin the future of technology and they have therefore become very large parts of the economy because the entire economy is becoming te technological yeah and so it's really a n the natural progression of economy towards these technological um phenomenon really I I think that at the same time there are still 5,000 companies listed on NASDAQ so it's not like there are many many companies that are innovators and change agents and people who are in every single sector of the economy creating change driving new things bringing new ideas into the market and also and or and are just very mature companies operating in in every sector in the economy so I don't actually agree that it's a bad thing it is the nature of econom the economy as it exists today because technology is such a huge driving force of the E economy changing t a bit here um so Adina you became CEO in 2017 yes what does one do when one becomes the CEO of a big company how do you approach it well I think first it's important to understand what you're walking into so I I started at nzac as an intern 31 years ago yeah uh so I knew the company very well whil you were at University uh right after yeah so um so I knew the company very well coming into the role of CEO but you also have to make sure that you're looking at with fresh eyes and understanding kind of where where is the company at the time the second thing is that I came into a company that was very well-managed and and had a great foundation so it was I had the fortune of coming into the seat and playing offense from day one yeah so my first year as CEO we really focus on driving our strategy did you set a new leader group when you came in um not when I not when I took um over as CEO but in the Years progressing up till I became CEO I was able to develop the team that I was able to have as CEO so the the prior CEO gave me the latitude to say okay how do you want to form your team how do you want to make sure you've got the right people in the right seats to take us forward and he and I work together on making that happen so that I came in with a strong found great business great team and then it was a matter of okay but how can we run faster how did how long did you work together in a transition period I came back to NASDAQ I had left NASDAQ to go and become the CFO of Carlile for three years and I helped them go public and I came back in 2014 as president I became CE in 2017 so we we work together almost three years yeah uh and that I think quite long period right but it was I I had to prove myself when I got back it wasn't like oh you're going to be CEO it was you could become CEO right you were there other people at the same time who also could become CEO like was there was it a race going on it was there was no race it was more just making sure that I was ready so if you don't make a complete fool of yourself you'll be the CEO or if I can show that I can really drive the company forward I can be the CEO which I did I I like to think um so but this transition was very smooth I mean it was kind of a textbook transition and so I took the job and the first thing we did we had two strategic efforts right when I started one was let's redefine the strategy of the company and two was let's really dive into how can we Revitalize the US capital markets because again we were at a period where we weren't getting a lot of IPOs and um the regulatory burden was becoming quite onerous and so we wanted to make sure we were recalibrating the markets but but the focus on strategy was a great way to engage the team right off the bat you know so we know that we're a great Market operator but we also knew that we had the ingredients to be a lot more so we took a a a kind of a three-prong roach to evaluating the strategy one was what are the technology trends that are going to redefine our industry in the next decade so let's have conviction on that two was what are the what are the industry trends that are going to redefine our clients over the next decade so we know where do we you know how do we want to align ourselves with that and three was what do our clients think we're great at what do they think we're not good at and what do they think where do they see us as a strategic partner so we took all of that input and we brought it to the team and we said okay how do we redefine where we're going going we had technology assets we were already providing technology to other exchanges we were providing technology to corporates to help them manage their lives in the public markets but it wasn't we weren't a scaled player in that space we were a very Niche provider and we went out to our clients they said you're really good at what you do you're a great Market operator but here are my biggest problem so with banks it was dealing with a lot of regulatory risk dealing with a lot of you know Capital risk and we've got a lot to do in managing criminals out of our networks so then you bought quite a few take that's right and then we also kind what kind of things did you buy so in for that particular area of our strategy which we kind of look at as the liquidity and the in the Integrity strategy um we focus in two areas one is scaling up our Capital markets technology to be not only the best at providing technology to other exchanges we also rewrote our entire trade life cycle technology ourselves that we're now deploying to our clients but we also we also scaled up in terms of being a great a great technology provider to other exchanges and through the clipo which is through the Adena acquisition the clipo product is a scaled risk management platform for all of the market participants in the world and so it allows them to to manage their lives in the markets much more successfully so that was one one part of our strategy the other part was we bought verafin and axml also part of the adenda transaction to be a scale provider of regulatory reporting and anti-financial crime technology um and we we compl that with our surveillance technology so we now can help them really manage all of the Integrity capabilities within the banks and Brokers and all the capital markets Tech within the banks and Brokers and exchanges that really make it so that they can get on the field successfully and be successful so now the stock exchange bit is actually the division where you make the least money which is quite interesting but um now this company called verafin which is is a leader in anti-financial crime Solutions yes and so I didn't know you had that before I started to read up on you why are you fighting Financial crime how does that come into it yeah it's great question so we had been uh we have been a provider of surveillance technology for trading firms and for exchanges since 2010 and what that means is we helped them root out Market manipulation and criminal activity within the markets and within their trading firms and when we went and talked to them about what could we do to expand and we did a complete strategic review of how can we expand this business great business and it's growing really well it's a SAS technology it's it's very modern so how can we make it so that we get bigger there because it was just it's a very great segment for us to play in they all said you know what we're really challenged with is anti-money laundering and fraud within the banking system can you help us with that and we said okay well that's good to know so we went back and we evaluated every single company in the space of anti-financial crime and we actually came out with one name of one company that we thought was the best in the business and by far the most technologically advanced they had 2 200 clients they were very scaled in the United States um but they hadn't yet reached the tier one and tier 2 Banks and that's our that's where we were really strong so we knew we could complement their capabilities and that's verin and they were not for sale um so but you managed to buy them you yeah it yeah we did we we went to the owner we talked to them we went to the firm we talked to them and at the end of the day they saw us as the great a great partner because we they're growing you know 20 plus percent a year so they're just a fast grower incredible technology we could learn a lot from them but they could learn a lot from us in terms of how they go up Market is there a lot of crime in markets there's an enormous amount of crime in the financial crime so they there's an estimate that there is3 trillion that is laundered through the system the financial system globally every year and half a trillion dollars that's lost to fraud every year and that's that's globally in the US we kind of we zeroed in on the fraud the fraud Challenge and in the United States there's $150 billion dollar loss to fraud every year that if you think about that if we were able to recover all that fraud and keep that in the in the right the right hands and to the hands to the consumers that would increase our GDP by 50 basis points so we would you the GDP of the country would be growing at a half% more if that that money wasn't lost to fraud so w well we can need that in Europe well and then and in Europe I think the unique element of the United States and why um verin been so successful here is that there's a law that allows Banks to share um certain information in order to fight crime so they can share it with a third party they can't share it with each other we can share it with a neutral third party we are that neutral third party so we have created a consortial data Lake made up of all of the banks um transactions from across across 2500 Banks we get about a billion transactions a week through that platform and we then apply very Advanced AI algorithms to be better than anyone in rooting out criminal behavior that then makes it so the banks could be more efficient fewer false positives and more effective by showing them more F real positives to make it so that their fraud program is much more effective same with AML it's a it's a more more complicated problem but similar approach let's move on to you and um kind of the leadership um now what kind of experiences during your career have you had that you think have shaped your leadership style the most well I had a couple um so the first was when I was 30 I became the head of the data division so they had the company decided to reorganize we had a trading Division and a listings Division and data set within the trading Division and they decided to branch that out and make it its own division so we ended up with three divisions at NASDAQ and when I was 30 they asked me to be ahead of it so that was a big one uh and I had been running products so I've been running some of the data products as a product manager couple of the trading products so I was already you know I was already kind of owning the business of these products but then to run an entire division was a huge step up and I learned a lot I I had to learn a lot because first of all I had to recognize the fact that I didn't know everything for the first time and I had to really rely on others who knew a lot more than I did and the second thing is that I had to scale a business I mean I had to create a business and scale a business within a company and that was a a great opportunity for me to demonstrate leadership skills you have a mentor who helped you on the way did um I did so our my first manager was a great mentor and he I had he was my manager for seven years he ran the trading business so then when I um when I branched out and took the data business he actually retired but he remained a great mentor to me and just a you know someone who could help me what is a good Mentor do a good Mentor is there to listen um to give you and I would say Mentor SLS sponsor because I think they're slightly different but in that that particular case he was both a mentor and a sponsor so what's the difference I I would say a mentor is someone who does not have a vested interest in your personal career that they're there to be kind of an outside adviser to look in and say let's talk about where you want to go what are the things that you do well what do you want to be able to do better you know what's holding you back and helping you navigate your career but without a vested interest in your career sponsor has a vested interest in your career meaning they might be your boss or your boss's boss and they're there to say let me figure out how to catalyze your career and make it so that you can move faster up an organization but here are the skills and capabilities that you need to be developing let's work together on making sure that that happens that's a sponsor how many people do you feel that you sponsor that you have a like a where you have a in a way a vested interest or you really follow the carrier moves well I mean I I certainly in a way you are a sponsor to all of your direct reports but they've gotten to the point where they have moved up all all the way through the organization so ordinarily if you're a sponsor you're looking one or two or three levels down in the organization and I would say that I'm you know I don't claim myself to be a sponsor because oftentimes it's not it's not something you explicitly discuss but there are certainly many people within the organization that I feel that I have a bestest interest in watching and helping them with their success as a mentor I do actually take on um formal mentorship and I usually have two mentors at a time so or mentees sorry at a time um down further down in the organization where I'm there to help them think about their career differently or to help them develop skills but I'm not in there I'm not directly assigned to their to helping them with their career but I am ultimately helping them think about their career differently so that they can then navigate their career successfully what did you learn at car well I went to Carlile to be their CFO and to help them go public so a few things first uh Carl a different part of the industry so I learned private equity and fascinating part of the business I'd always in my heart thought I wanted to go into the buy side because my dad had been in the investment management industry my brother was running a hedge fund so I thought this is where I was destined to be so I went into Carlile and learned the private Equity industry that was one two very different culture uh it's a collaborative culture as opposed to nzq being a little bit more at the time at least a command and control culture so understanding how to manage a partnership as opposed to a C Corp you know a more hierarchical business was very interesting I had three bosses so very different way of doing business and I think I learned a lot from that in a positive way and then the third thing was that the finance organization at that time was bigger um it was more complicated and it was very Global so for me I also was able to expand my leadership skills while we took the company through a very unique journey of going public so learning how to take a company public was a great skill because when I got back to NASDAQ I was able to look out and say what was that project process really like are we doing enough to support our clients as they're going public can nasac be a better partner to our clients as in in the process of going public so it actually brought a lot of knowledge back that I was able to apply to the business do you think you're a better leader now than when you were 30 oh definitely what's uh how are you different well when you're 30 and you're taking on you know you you kind of want to think that you know everything for one thing and second of all you're trying to figure out how not to do everything but to make it all get done the way that you want it you know that's like if you know what I mean I mean you know there's a there's a scalability to that that has some limitations um so when you're 30 you're trying to learn new skills learn how to manage learn how to lead and obviously drive a business forward and so there's a lot that you're learning that you probably are not doing perfectly how do you do it differently now so when you go from being a manager to a leader it's the difference between directing people in their activities to empowering people so that they can be empowered to do a better job at their job than you can do at their job isn't that just amazing and that is a total difference isn't it just amazing you ask people to do something without um setting any limitations or defining it to uh kind of accurately and then they just come up with things which is beyond what you could do what beyond what you could do so what does that require I love it it requires a lot of trust yeah and you have to the the most important thing a leader can do is put the right people in the right seats yeah and it and and to think I want to put a person in that seat that will be better at their job than I can ever be at their job because they by them being better their jobs all of them then you the whole company is a better company and you get a chance to empower them to do great things and to and to make sure your you know Capital allocation decision set the vision set the direction make sure you've got the capital allocation decisions to drive that direction successfully pick a few projects where you want to get personally involved and otherwise empower the team to do great things it it takes some confidence right yes I would agree with that it takes confidence in yourself but it also takes confidence in the team and it's difficult do when you're 30 because if they do everything better than you they are be going to become B not you right right well in fact that was an interesting moment for me because when I took the job as the head of the data division there had been someone who was running data within the trading division right and he was not the person that ultimately took the job so he worked for me and that was a an interesting transition from being a peer to to having that kind of relationship so I did have to learn and I learned very quickly he knew a a ton that I did not know and he was great at certain elements of the job so so I my job was to empower him and that was the first time I had to figure out how to work with someone who knew more than I did about something and who and was better at certain things than I was at something you know and so how do we how do you Empower that person how do you bring them in as an advisor how do they and and working successfully with them and I actually have to say I think that was one of my big learnings in when I when I took the job as data so that when I ultimately became the CFO that was the first time when I realized that I had to go from being a manager to like a true leader and um and because there were a lot of elements of finance that I there's a lot of expertise embedded in the team and I was never going to know everything and that moment of realizing my job is to empower them to do great things that was a that was a big step up for for me personally let's talk about culture um how many people are you uh we have about 8,500 employees um all around the world what and what do they do about half the team are technologists so uh software engineers and all the all the people that support software engineering and then we have obviously a large sales organization a product team that really help what I call business product team that really supports the business strategy and the execution of the strategy ac across the business and then we have Market structure experts legal and Regulatory experts um and and then of course all of the corporate functions so and what type of people do you hire I mean let's say now um you interview me what are you looking for so the first thing I would look for is someone who has is a team oriented person so confidence what we call confidence and humility right so you have to understand who you are what you're great at what you're not great at and how you're going to make sure that you fill in the gaps to make it so that you can deliver great things the second thing is um curiosity you know constant curiosity it is a fast moving world out there technology is moving F at a faster Pace than ever before the capital markets are constantly evolving and if you're not intellectually curious you're going to get stuck in a box pretty quickly and that's not and and and you might stick us in a box and that that is not where we want to go so constant curiosity and then of course um whatever the expertise that we're driving that we're asking for is is I think table Stakes of course to to the role but then the last thing is kindness and you know kind of how do you work really well in with in groups how do you make it so that you manage by influence you lead by influence so that you get more done than your job would necessarily entail do you think kind kindness is underrated in this Society I think that there's a reputation within certain industries that that would be Thea that that um kind kindness is a weakness I think kindness is a strength uh you know our business we are technology business but we are founded on the on the notion of relationships I always say that even in the trading business where it is a very analytical decision as to whether we go first in your routing tables or not that relationships break ties and so at the very least relationships break ties but at the most they drive trust and if you are the trusted provider clients naturally want to do more with you and that trust is the most important thing that you can gain gain and I think kindness is a is a big part of building that trust I think I think the concept of kindness is quite funny because when you are 20 the cool people they were not kind they were the least kind okay and so nobody wanted to be kind because then you were just like a loser now you fast forward until you're 50 and if I were to if I were to pick one trait which I would really love to have in my you know partner or colleague it's kindness of course because at the end of the day kindness is generally a reflection of confidence too and and I think those things go hand in glove with each other um and I you know at the end that's what you're looking for is that kind of kind confident humble leader um person who can relate to other people who can get the most out of another person and who cares about those other people and their success that's a great leader and that's what we look for you mentioned that Curiosity was uh uh a key thing that you were looking for what are you curious about these days everything related to the future of technology everything are you curious about anything non-technology related uh oh yeah I mean so I when I was in college I was a political science major so and I really studied actually I I was my my concentration was in Soviet studies so so international relations what's happening in the world how do how do how do Nations come together or fall apart how do they how do they drive their economies forward what are the ingredients for a successful economy a successful Society I care deeply about that and I'm very curious about that you also have a black belt in Korea in kickboxing um well well done um is there anything from that sport that you have taken into business oh definitely um like what well first is the training part of ta kundo which is Korean kickboxing is the in my opinion the fun part you know the part that's hard but fun the sparring part of of uh taond do is the scary part and but at the same time you have to put yourself in a position where you have to overcome fear I think it's important as a person I think it's important as a leader that you that you put yourself in a position to overcome fear and taon do is very good at that because I was very fearful of uh of sparring the second thing is the need to play offense and defense all the time it's like chess and I think chess is also another great skill to have if you're going to be a business leader because you always have to remember every offensive move requires a defensive move at the same time so in and sparring you can learn that really the hard way because you get all excited you're about to kick someone in the head and feels great and then they just punch you in the gut you know so you have to make sure that as you are trying to figure out how to position yourself to do the offensive move that you're not leaving yourself exposed offensively so that those are the two things that I learn a lot about do you have fear I do I mean well every person has fear I do not come into the job with fear um I I had enough experiences in my early career not everybody has called fear yeah I mean I I would say that I had a lot of experiences early in my career where I had to overcome that sense of fear you know to kind of how am I going to prove myself how I'm going to make sure that this is successful that when I got the job as CEO I felt extremely ready and in the job as CEO you don't feel fear I mean you have moments of making sure that you manage through challenging situations but all of the experience that led up to that gets you prepared for that so I don't walk around with fear but I do think that it's couple of um cosos have spoken to you know on these podcast like Bob Iger and Disney and and also Michael Dell uh they say that they haven't got the fear again gen well I can't say I would say that I have a healthy fur Gene but the most important thing you can do is train yourself to overcome it now how do you relax apart from kickboxing uh well my husband um his profession is he's a pottery instructor uh he was a lawyer for a long time and then had a second career as a pottery instructor so he is he's taught me potteries which is have you got like a a wheel at home like we do so we have a small Studio at home we go on Saturdays and we'll we'll throw pots and he teaches me he's very good and I'm very bad but um but it's a very relaxing way for us to spend time together we also play a lot of pickle ball um and we we play that competitively so we have a good time with that very good um now finally we got um tens of thousands of young people uh listening to this what what is your advice to them I would say first always stay curious um always you know make sure that you when you have the opportunity to say yes you say yes you know early in my career I was asked to do a lot of things were outside the scho of my job and I would always just say okay I'll do that and then you go back to your office and you go hm I wonder how I'm going to do that but you know you have to figure it out and that's the great thing if someone's trusting you to give you that projects they think that you're going to be able to figure it out so take it um now if you take say yes to too many things then you need to sit down and say okay how do I prioritize these things but the fact of the matter is say yes and stay curious well Alina you for sure have figured out NASDAQ well done and congratulations thank you very much it's great to spend time you thank you
