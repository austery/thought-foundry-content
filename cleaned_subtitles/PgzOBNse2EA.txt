What are the fundamental concepts folks need to know of getting to higher quality products? The most important thing is looking at data. Looking at data has always been a thing even before AI. There's just a little bit of a twist on it for AI, but really the same thing applies when you see a real user input like this. You actually look at what users are prompting your AI with. You realize it's very vague. Absolutely. That's the whole interesting bit. It's like once you see that people are talking like that, you might actually want to simulate stuff that looks like that because that's the real distribution of the data or that's what the real world looks like. I'm sure our listeners expect some like magical system that does this automatically and you're like, "No, man. Just spend 3 hours of your afternoon, go through, read some of these chats, look at some of them with your human eyes, put one sentence notes on all of them, and then run a quick categorization exercise and get to work." And you see this have actual real impact on quality and reducing these errors. Yeah, it has an immense quality. It's so powerful that some of my clients are so happy with just this process that they're like, "That's great, Hamill. We're done." And I'm like, "No, wait. We can do more." Welcome back to How I AI. I'm Claire Vo, product leader and AI obsessive here on a mission to help you build better with these new tools. Today I have such an educational episode for people like me that are building AI products. We have Hamill Hussein who's going to demystify debugging errors in your AI product, writing good evals and show us how he runs his entire business using Claude and a GitHub repo. Let's get to it. This episode is brought to you by GoFundMe giving funds, the zero fee daff. I want to tell you about a new product GoFundMe has launched called Giving Funds. A smarter, easier way to give, especially during tax season, which is basically here. GoFundMe giving funds is the DAFF or donor advice fund from the world's number one giving platform trusted by 200 million people. It's basically your own mini foundation without the lawyers or admin costs. You contribute money or appreciated assets, get the tax deduction right away, potentially reduce capital gains, and then decide later where to donate from 1.4 million nonprofits. There are zero admin or asset fees, and while the money sits there, you can invest and grow it tax-free, so you have more to give later. All from one simple hub with one clean tax receipt. Lock in your deduction now and decide where to give later. Perfect for tax season. Join the GoFundMe community of 200 million and start saving money on your tax bill. All while helping the causes you care about the most. Start your giving fund today in just minutes at gofundme.com/howi. We'll even cover the DAFF pay fees if you transfer your existing DAFF over. That's gofundme.com/howi aai to start your giving fund. Haml, I'm really excited for this particular episode because I have been building products for a very long time and this has been one of a few times in my career where the how and what of products that I'm building are so different than what I've built in the past. They're technically different. they're different from a user experience perspective and then they have they have these non-deterministic models on the back end that I'm somehow as a product leader responsible for making output highquality consistent reliable interesting user experiences and it's such a challenging problem and what I love about what you're going to show us today is how to approach that systematically that quality of product building in an AI world systematically and how you use different techniques to get AI products which are new to all of us from good to great. Yeah, I'm happy to be here. Excited to talk about it. So, you know, this is such a new thing for product managers. I'm curious if you could start with the fundamentals. What are the fundamental concepts or things that you think folks building AI products really need to know about the process of getting to higher quality products? And then I know you're going to show us a couple examples of how to do that. So the fundamentals really come down to the most important thing is looking at data. And I I believe from working with many product managers in the past is looking at data has always been a thing like even before AI uh you know like I'm pretty sure that product managers that like can like write a little bit of SQL or okay with spreadsheets looking at numbers looking at metrics you know that feels like it's kind of table stakes for being a good product manager nowadays and so there's just a little bit of a twist on it for AI but really the same thing applies Um, and it's just like, okay, how do you do that for AI? And that's that's what we we teach. And that's what I'm going to show you today. Great. And I cannot agree more. I think one of the most transformational skills I learned as a young um, baby chicken product manager was being able to write SQL and actually do my own data analysis and exploration. But I think the surface area is so broad now with AI and the data is different. So why don't you show us what we should be looking at when we're building these AI products? Yeah. So um let me share my screen a bit. Let me give you some background first. So this is one of my clients. The name of the company is called Nurture Boss. And as you can see, it's an AI assistant for apartment managers or uh property managers. And really like you know um you can kind of get an idea from their website which I'm showing right now. Um you know it's a virtual leasing assistant. So you know they they help with the whole top of funnel of like helping set up appointments, helping prospective residents like find their apartments, setting up appointments, questions about rent, so on and so forth. Kind of like trying to reduce the toil of property managers still having humans in the loop. And so when they came to me, they had already prototyped something out, you know, kind of vibe checking it just like everyone does and put everything together, but they wanted to know like, okay, how do we actually make it work well? Because the AI fails in weird ways and it doesn't always do the right thing, but it feels like, okay, every time we fix a prompt, we're not really sure, like maybe we're breaking something else or is it really improving things as a whole? We don't really know. We're just guessing. We're just kind of like looking at it and just getting a vibes. And that is a very uncomfortable feeling of trying to scale a product. Okay. So the first thing that I'll jump right into is this idea of traces. So traces are this concept of from engineering, but it doesn't have to be scary. basically like and it's very uh topical for AI because with AI usually have many different events or especially like for a chatbot you have multi-turn conversations where you're going back and forth with an AI there might be retrieval of information there might be calling some tools external tools internal tools so on and so forth and so you want to log these traces and there's um there's many different ways to go about it but just to kind of show you exactly what happened at Nurture Boss. Let's go into what that looks like. So, this is a platform called Brain Trust. There's a lot of them. Uh this is one called Phoenix, which is like the same exact data in here. Um it doesn't really matter. You can see like they're both the same, right? Like, so what we have here, let me just go into a single trace. So, um this is what I would call a trace. So I can make this bigger so you can see it in a full screen and you can see what an AI interaction looks like in this product. So you have okay the system prompt you are an AI assistant working as a leasing team member at some apartment. These are all fictitious because these all been scrubbed for uh PII stuff. You know your primary role is to respond to text messages. So this is receiving text messages. Okay. And you have a whole host of rules like respond you know uh provide accurate information answer any question for residents do the following you know provide this website for example if you they ask for a rental application provide this so on and so forth all these rules right and this is a real uh user saying hello there's what's up to four month rent I don't even know what that means I got you I got you let me read it hello there what's up two four month I thought I had it. I thought I had it. Yeah, it's unclear but okay. I mean like it's fine. This is real. This is the real world. These are real traces. So um you know and then there's a there's a tool call here get communities information. It's calling this tool, this internal tool and um the tool call result uh comes back with this information and this is all hidden from the user. The user is not seeing this tool call result. Um he's like okay here's the information you can use about the community blah blah blah. It's not even sure like this is the right tool call. We'll get to that in a moment. And then the assistant goes hello we are currently offering up toate. So this is like back to the user. This is what the AI responds to the user with. Hello, we are currently offering up to eight weeks rent free as a special promotion. Please note the applicable lease specials and concessions can vary blah blah blah. Okay, so like is this and I have a cheat sheet for myself about what is actually right and wrong. Um, okay. So like the comment here is the user is probably asking about lease terms and stuff like that, not about specials. So like it's not really clear like this is the right this is not like what we want and this is so realistic right like everyone has experienced AI like this is like it's kind of is being helpful but it's not really doing what you want to and it's actually pretty challenging because it's not really clear what the user want is you could go in a lot of different directions of this you know when I'm testing my own AI this is such an eye opening example because when I'm testing my own AI ask it good questions and I spell correctly and I'm very clear but when you see a real user user input like this, you actually look at what users are prompting your AI with. You realize it's very vague. They say stuff like, "What's up?" Um, the the question there's there's no clear question. And so, I really do think looking at real user data kind of can get a developer or PM out of their own mind on how they think users are going to interact with the system. Absolutely. It's very critical um that you do this. And so now you might not have this data and I just jumped right into a real example just to set things off and we can go into all these different rabbit holes of like what if you don't have data and stuff but I just want to like ground it and like okay set the stage like this is kind of one foundation is like you have to have data. There's different ways to get it. One is you can log it from your real system and you have these things to look at. Another way is like okay you can have synthetic data where you sort of generate within LLM you can generate questions like this you know hello what's you know it might be hard to generate stuff that looks like that because I don't even know we don't know what it means um and probably an LLM won't generate stuff like that but that's the whole interesting bit is like once you see that people are talking like that you might actually want to simulate stuff that looks like that because that's what If that's the real distribution of the data or that's what the real world looks like, um you might want to challenge your LLM or your AI system appropriately. Okay, so let's step back here. So you have the system, it's doing stuff. It's like there's stuff like this happening. We can look at another trace if you want just to kind of get an idea. And this is, you know, this is not presscripted. I didn't memorize what's going on in these traces. We're just looking at them naturally. So, this is something this is another uh apartment complex, Metobrook Apartments. Same idea. So, we won't read the whole system prompt again. Okay. So, we'll scroll down here. Let's get to what the user is asking. Walk in T. So, this must be another text message situation. And the assistant says, "Our team tries their best to accommodate walk-ins. Me get you." Now, that's hilarious. Like, I don't What? Why is LM That's surprising. Like why is it saying me get you to someone who can help? Maybe it's trying to mimic the uh the uh the user somehow. Um and then it does like uh yes and then okay great. So it seems like this one maybe is okay. Um let's see what we ended up annotating. Uh yeah, we said this one is okay. There's there's some metadata down here about our labels which we'll talk about next. But yeah, you can so you can see like this is a real system. There's many different things that can happen here. So the question becomes like okay so we talked about this like writing SQL and data but like how do you take that same mindset to this like what do you even do with this right you have this like crazy like interaction is like how do you analyze this without go without getting stuck because like this seems like um intractable right at first pass. No, I I was just thinking I was like, what is the SQL query I write to get like the first prompt and like how do you query for give me all the first prompts that include typos? Like give me the all the first prompts that are ambiguous questions. It just feels almost insurmountable and then you know you showed us two examples and it's two of probably thousands and thousands and thousands. So going through it manually is probably not super scalable. So I'm curious what is the systematic kind of solution here? Okay, so the systematic solution is called something called error error analysis. So error analysis just means it's kind of a counterintuitive process that's extremely effective and it's dumb, but it's it's accessible to everybody and it works and it's not something that I made up. um it's been around in machine learning for a really long time because actually machine learning has the same problem like before like generative AI like we had these stoastic systems that can do like a whole number of things and like how do you actually like analyze that and like figure out like what's going wrong and improve it. So error analysis has two steps. The first step is writing notes and it's called open coding and it's basically like journaling what is wrong. So if we go back to like that that other uh trace that we saw. So let me just uh go back to it. Like the first one we would uh step into this trace and we would say okay like every every observability tool has their own let's say uh different ways to take notes. You know already have a note in here. assistant should have asked follow-up questions about you know about the question what's up with four month rent because it's unclear user intent and this is writing notes about what is going on okay and you do that for like a 100 traces randomly sample 100 traces and you do that you and you stop at the most upstream error you find so you read this and you see what's going on and you're like hm okay the user intent seems like we didn't do a good job of like clarifying that what the hell that they're they need. Yeah. And so I think that's the most upstream problem in the sequence of events. So I'm going to go ahead and just write that as a note. Yeah. And and you say focus on the most upstream problem because you presume that if you can get early intent, early kind of clarity, correctness, right? The rest of the system is more likely to be correct downstream. Yeah. Because it's causal in nature. So as we have the sequence of events whether it's like user prompts tool calls retrieval for rag whatever it may be any error at any point along the chain you know like will cause downstream problems and so to simplify our lives for this purposes of error analysis it's a heristic you know eventually you do want to care about the different errors and different downstream but when you're starting out just focus on the upstream error because we're trying to make it tractable and this is like the way that you're going to get results fast. So basically um what you do is you go through and you collect a bunch of notes and then what you do is you can take these notes and you can like download them or whatever and you can categorize those notes and you can even put these notes into like chat GBT. It's like hey here's all my notes like can you bucket these into categories and you kind of have to go back and forth with it a little bit like hey these are my notes these are the categories. Um, uh, I think like you're missing a category, whatever. Now, with Nurture Boss, what we ended up doing is we actually made one of the things that we highly recommend a lot of people think about is to make your own custom annotation tool. Like there's you see this is here in Brain Trust and it's also here in Arise Phoenix. They're very similar. You can see this is a very similar looking UI and you have they even called it error analysis here and you can like add your notes like you know whatever and you can save those notes and same thing if you're going to be looking at a lot of data you don't want to slow yourself down and you want to be able to have like very human readable sort of you know output and sometimes like this markdown stuff is like not that readable and you want to make sure that okay like it makes sense to you and you can fly through it as fast as possible. So um you know it's really easy to vibe code this stuff um because ultimately what you're doing is like showing data. So when the in the nurture boss situation so as you might have gathered like they have multiple channels that customers can contact them on. They have like text message which we which we saw. They have email. They have a chat bot on the website so on and so forth. So they just wanted something they could like navigate faster just like my coded essentially. I mean they have the per we were developers but you know we're using AI in our process and do this very fast is okay like what channel is the trace from and then like some other filters about like hey did we already annotate this or not and then just kind of have some statistics at the top you know this is like what the annotation like looks like it's kind of very similar but just like dialed into what we wanted and like you know we just took notes and then what uh for nurture boss What we did is okay we had an automated process that would summarize like categorize those notes into like what are the biggest issues and then we would just something very simple like counting. Counting is always powerful as you know as a product manager you can go into a system the you experience like writing SQL queries like you know how powerful counting is counting remains powerful and so you can uh count these issues right so so like okay for nurture boss I don't know if you can see my screen or if it's too small can try to zoom in more yeah yeah that's great is okay what were the most what are the biggest issues after doing that error analysis exercise which only took you know a few hours. Yeah. It's like okay um we're having a lot of transfer and handoff issues. We're trying to transfer the you the customer to a human. We're having a lot of tour scheduling issues. So like they're trying to schedule a tour but like a reschedule tours. In this case we found that like someone's asking to reschedule. There is no rescheduled tour but like the AI doesn't know that. It just keeps scheduling more tours which is bad. um you know uh followup so you know AI not following up when the user has a question you know sometimes incorrect information provided okay so like you see like these are kind of the count and now we have now we're not lost now we know what we should be working on we know okay you know what we should fix this like transfer handoff issue and this tour scheduling issue we have confidence like you know what like we we're not paralyzed anymore We know, okay, this is what we need to fixate on our AI. This episode is brought to you by Persona, the B2B identity platform helping product fraud and trust and safety teams protect what they're building in an AI first world. In 2024, bot traffic officially surpassed human activity online. And with AI agents projected to drive nearly 90% of all traffic by the end of the decade, it's clear that most of the internet won't be human for much longer. That's why trust and safety matters more than ever. Whether you're building a next-gen AI product or launching a new digital platform, Persona helps ensure it's real humans, not bots or bad actors, accessing your tools. With Persona's building blocks, you can verify users, fight fraud, and meet compliance requirements. All through identity flows tailored to your product and risk needs. You may have already seen Persona in action if you verified your LinkedIn profile or signed up for an Etsy account. It powers identity for the internet's most trusted platforms and now it can power yours too. Visit withpersona.com/howi AI to learn more. I love this. Just to recap, so you're taking these traces of these real conversations. And you know, you don't even have to read all of it. You have to read till you hit hit a snag, right? To re to hit an obvious sort of like incorrect um or high friction part of the experience. you have vibe coded an app that makes it really easy for the team generally to go in annotate these rate them sort of like good quality bad quality automatically categorize them count them and then you have a prioritize list and you're like here are the problems that I need to go solve and what I love about this is you know I I I'm sure our listeners expect some like magical system that does this automatically and you're like no man just spend three hours of your afternoon go through read some of these chats, look at some of them with your human eyes, put one sentence notes on all of them, and then run a quick categorization exercise and and get to work. And you see this have actual real impact on quality and reducing these errors. Yeah, it has an immense quality. Is it so powerful that some of my clients are so happy with just this process that they're like, "That's great, Hamill. We're done." And I'm like, "No, wait. Like, we can do more." um you know you've paid for more like you know whatever they're like no this is so great like I just feel like I I know what to do and so they they find so much value in this like process that and it is like very important this is something that no one talks about like people when you talk about eval like well how do you write an eval what eval do you do what tool should you use before you get into all that stuff you need to have some grounding in like what eval you should even write because there's infinite eval. So like in this case, we would write we wrote an eval about tour scheduling issues and we wrote an eval about transfer handoff issues and we felt really good about that because we knew that like that is a real problem and we we knew how to write the eval because like we saw that error. Um and we knew how to find data to test that eval because again we already tagged it and we saw that error which is exactly the way you want to do it. Yeah. And what I also like about this is it does take the burden off your users. I mean so many people try to collect this data by like putting a little thumbs up and thumbs down or little comments and like I even have that on parts of my product and yes it is useful but it only gives you a sliver of the kind of self-identified errors in the app and users are highly tolerant of systems and so sometimes those errors just don't get escalated by user. They'll either abandon or they'll just work through too many steps to get to the outcome that they want. they'll have a quality experience. And so I think just taking the burden on yourself and saying you're responsible for looking at the data. You can create simple ways to categorize it. Um and then you have a priorized list. Now if your client is willing to go the next step and do something about this um and write evals and fix prompts. What are your kind of next steps here? What's another example of of where we go from here? Um I just want to talk about just for a minute like okay so this partic this particular technique is so powerful and not that many people know about it. Um you know so I actually recently did a training with open AI showing the people at OpenAI like you know how this works for domain specific evals. Um if you want to learn more about like this we had Jacob the founder of Nurture Boss like walk through like this whole process in like two minutes. So you can find it on this on this page if you would like. Um okay so to get to your question like what do you do now? Okay so you have uh like you know you've done your error analysis you have like prioritized these things so like now what do you do? So now you get into uh writing the evals. So now you have to decide like what kind of evals do you want? There's different kinds of evals. So there's reference based evals which is like you know what the right answer is and maybe you can write some code you don't need like an LLM to do the eval for you or if it's more subjective in nature then you know maybe like this trans this transfer handoff issue maybe it's more subjective in nature um then you need an LLM judge and so um what you can do is you can start to write those eval um I had this blog blog post here about evals in general. So there's this diagram. It's really hard to put this whole thing into a diagram honestly, but cuz you know it can be it's kind of it's not it's nonlinear process. Um but really what you want to do is okay we already covered like logging traces and there's two different kinds of there's different kinds of evaluators or evaluations. There's like kind of like unit tests which is like what I would say like code based evals and then there's like models so like LLMs you know codebased eval so like you know for example what is what kinds of things that be good for codebase eval is like okay if you have like user ids showing up in the response or something like that okay you can test for that in code um for I have to say you're saving my life here because I was thinking what is one of these unit tests I need to write and that is exactly one of them, which is my tool calls need UU IDs and users definitely do not. So, uh that's a that's a great example of one for anybody that's writing a chatbot that does a lot of kind of tool calling. Yeah, because they can show up by accident like me. You might have the UID in the system prompt and it inadvertently shows up in the output for some reason the other and you don't want that. Okay. you want to write these tests um with no matter what kinds of tests you write, you want to create test cases and sometimes you can gather those from your traces. Sometimes sometimes you might want to generate synthetic data and so um you know this is like a prompt for a different real estate agent assistant called Reachout which is for residential real estate. Um, and this is kind of like a simplified version of your prompt, right? 50 different instructions that a real estate agent can give to their assistant. It creates contacts on their CRM. Contact details can include name, phone, email, whatever. And basically, you know, it can generate synthetic inputs to a system that then you can then log traces from. I'm going to jump around a little bit, so we'll kind of come back to that. Um, okay, we already covered logging traces. you know, this is another like custom log annotation thing yet again because we re, you know, really emphasize this that it's really important to remove all friction doing this. So, I won't linger on this too much. And basically um you know one kind of thing you want to do is like okay if you're using LM as a judge or anything else what you want to do is so one thing that's usually skipped when we talk about LM as a judge is like people are just using LM as a judge off the shelf like they're like writing a prompt they're saying okay judge it and then reporting that. Um, let me actually go to a different blog post that is a little bit better for LM judge, which is this one. Okay, so LM is a judge. So you often see sometimes in LM eval land like a dashboard that looks like this. Helpfulness, truthfulness, conciseness, score, tone, whatever. What the hell does that mean? Does anyone know what that means? Nobody knows. No one understands concretely. Like if a helpfulness score is 4.2 two and it goes to 4.7. Like, do you really know like what's wrong, what changes? No. And so, there's a lot of guidance in how to create LM as a judge. Um, it's probably too much for this podcast to like tell you all of the things. And this blog post is quite long um like enumerating like how to do it correctly. But the main things that you need to keep in mind is like one you need to have binary outputs like is it good or bad for a specific problem. So for like you know the handoff problem for nurture boss like okay was there a problem or not and you want specific evaluators for specific problems. Um number two is like you want to you need to handle label some data which you already kind of do error analysis and you want to compare the judge to the handlabeled data. so that you can trust the judge. The last thing you want to do is like throw up a judge on the dashboard like this and then like people don't know if they can trust it. And the worst thing you do as a product manager is like start showing people evals and then at some point the people's perception of the product or their experience of the product doesn't uh doesn't match the eval. They're like, "Hey, like it's it's broken, but the evals are showing that it's good." And that's the that's the moment like people lose trust in you and then they will like it's going to be really hard to regain that trust. And so the way that you make sure you can trust these automated LMELs is to you know measure sort of agreement with these hand labels. Yep. So what I'm hearing from you in terms of LM as judge is these general buckets with arbitrary ratings against them not useful and will often work against you. You want to write specific binary outcome evals for specific tasks. So you want a set of evals that are like does this get scheduled correctly? Yes or no. And so you're making a list of evals um that the LLM as a judge is evaluating that gives you a pass fail or yes, no, true, false, binary outcome. Very simple. And then you're doing the additional layer of work of validating that the eval is valid by actually looking at that outcome and saying, do I actually agree with this LLM as a judge evaluation of the quality of this output? And that those steps together are going to give you a much more comprehensive view of how your product's performing. And then I and then that that second layer of human evaluation, it's going to give you more confidence that either your LLM's judge is good and is evaluating your outputs correctly or you actually need to tune um that judge itself to get to higher quality evaluations. Is that kind of the summary of of what you as well? Yes. And the thing that's really important is like it's really difficult to write any LM judge prompt if you don't do this because the research shows and there's some research u that my co-instructor for the course that I'm teaching um there's a paper called who validates the validators and the research shows that people are really bad at writing specifications or requirements until they need to react to what an LLM is doing to clarify and help them externalize what they're what they want and it's like only going through this process of sort of okay writing detailed notes and critiquing things that you can then like start refining the LM judge. Great. And so we've we've covered sort of um traces and errors annotation you have kind of how to build unit tests that are automated tests. Of course you're looking at it manually. you're doing LMS judge the correct way. Now tell me, I've identified all these problems. I have these evals that give me data. How do I write a good prompt? Like are there are there some techniques or you know what do I what do I do? Are there things that you found consistently in the next step of improving your system instructions, improving your tools, um where you actually have to go solve these problems are are effective. Yeah. So um when you get to like the errors that you have so like you know you're going to use these evals and you're going to deploy it at scale okay it's like you're not looking at all your data you're you're looking at a sample of data and you're going to score your LM as a judge against like a sample of label data and you're going to deploy that at scale and you're going to like look at where are there errors and it's pretty like you know you have to make a judgment call on like how do how do you improve your system based on the errors you're finding? Like is it a retrieval problem? Is it a prompting issue? Is it um should you be putting more examples into prompt? And you know, there's not really a silver bullet there, I would say. Um you know, retrieval is its own sort of beast. It tends to like retrieval tends to be the Achilles heel of a lot of AI products. um you know where things tend to go wrong. But sometimes yeah it's just like especially in the beginning you're going to find a low lot of lowhanging fruits. Like for example in nurture boss the system prompt didn't contain today's date. So when the person said hey can you do a schedule for tomorrow? AI had no idea what like we don't know what tomorrow is but didn't didn't tell the user that right? We just guessed. So like you know that's really obvious. So there'll be like obvious things you can fix and then there's like lesser obvious things you can fix. You could try like prompt engineering. So there's a spectrum of like okay prompt engineering all the way to like fine-tuning. Most people shouldn't get into fine-tuning. I will say that if you do all this eval stuff, fine-tuning is basically free because uh you have all this infrastructure set up to do all these measurements and curate data like high signal data that is difficult and that difficult data that those difficult examples where your AI is not getting right. That's exactly the stuff you want to fine-tune on. That's like the very high value stuff for fine-tuning. Um and yeah, fine-tuning is not so hard. At in the rech case, we had to do fine-tuning to get the extra mile. Um but in most case like it's prompt engineering. There's no magic prompt engineering tricks. It's really like I would say there's a lot of experimentation uh that you should engage in. Well, and one of the things that I found so interesting as an AI builder that comes from a software engineering background is now I have a natural language surface for bugs in terms of my system instructions and prompts. And I had this experience recently on chat pd where we were really having a hard time with tool calling. Like one of our tools just was intermittently not being called no matter what the user would say. And it was really hard to pin down and we have this, you know, monster system prompt. I went through and there was like two words in the prompt that were just incorre they were incorrect. It was about UU IDs, but it was like incorrect. And as soon as I deleted those two words, which had just been, you know, typed in by somebody and pushed in the repo and blah blah, uh, our quality of that tool calling shot right up. And so I just have to, you know, we have to as product people, as engineers, start thinking of the full surface area of our product. And it's not the construction of the agent or the chatbot itself. It really goes down into what words are going in and out of your system. And it's a complicated surface area to debug and keep track of because it's unstructured, but it's super high impact in my experience. Yeah, definitely. you know, when it comes to tool calls. Actually, let me show you one thing that always comes up is people uh wonder like how do you evaluate agents because like you know there's so many different handoffs like how do you actually like do it in real life? So, let me see if I can share that. Okay, so I'm sharing like um the book that we give students in our class. Um but let me go to the table of contents. So there's all these different areas. We'll kind of skim towards the agent part of it. So um there's like analytical tools you can use for everything. You know for agents you can build these transition matrices. So going from one step to the other where are the errors located in like what agent handoffs or what steps being handed off to what other step. So like in this case okay we have this like generate SQL to execution SQL that's where a lot of this like errors are happening and then you can like then you can narrow it down. So as you get more advanced into eval subject you there's a lot of analytical tools you can use to kind of go about things. It is very interesting like as a product manager you can get really far with AI assisted notebooks. Yeah. What I was going to say about this from a product manager perspective is this is really put from the frame of errors and evals but even just analytics for agentic systems figuring out what your users are trying to do. I I haven't thought of this idea of actually mapping out the different conversation to tool or toolto tool handoffs. And even if all of this was working effectively, a product ma product manager's ability to see the data of its agents behavior from a toolto tool handoff perspective and really identify like where are users trying to get value out of the system also can do things like drive roadmap ideas, right? If you're seeing, okay, people are just writing SQL, executing SQL, like we need to dig into what other things around that could we build for users that are interesting. So I like it from the error perspective. I also like it just from the product discovery perspective. Yeah, definitely. That's that's very true. Um, yeah, I like that perspective. Okay, so you've shown us how to I the other thing that I like that you've shown us is that there's no way to do this than just do it. Like I people want these tricks. They want some hack. They want some off-the-shelf solution. And you're saying like honestly look at the data. Build yourself a solution if you have to validate it yourself. Do the hard work. And if you do the hard work, you can actually create these leaps in product quality and experience. But right now, you just you just got to look at the data and and make some decisions and make things better. So, I think this has been super illuminating in terms of helping people like me that are building AI products make them higher quality. Let's spend just a couple minutes on a totally different topic, which you are running this business. You're running a course. You are clearly an expert in AI. What tools are in your stack for kind of running your day-to-day life or at least your business life? Yeah. So, I do a lot of writing and I do a lot of communication with clients and you know, I also want to reduce my own toil and so um let me share my screen again. Yeah, it's probably easiest to show you cloud project. So, I have all these cloud projects. Um so okay I have like one for copywriting I have a legal assistant I have consulting proposals. Consulting proposals is pretty interesting. So it's basically like um an example of consulting proposals. It's um you know I'm so it's kind of funny. I have skill level partner of palunteers expert generative AI blah blah blah and you know I give it some instructions on the on the other like let's say proposals I have um and you know I have like this prompt you know whatever um get to the point writing short sentences whatever and basically I have a lot of examples and basically anytime I have a intake call with a client who wants a proposal I give this the transcript and then it's made It's basically almost ready. It's like just need it takes me about a minute to to kind of edit it and get it going. So that's that's proposals, you know. I have one for the course which is like, you know, a lot of context about my course which is like the entire book. Uh I have an FAQ that's very like extensive that I've published. Um, there's all the transcripts, all the Discord messages, office hours, you know, and again, my prompt is like, hey, your job is to help course instructors to create standalone interesting FAQs. These are, this is like a writing prompt that I have everywhere. Do not add word words. Don't repeat yourself. Get to the point. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's very, you have to really, you know, um, and so, okay, like Yeah. It's just, you know, this stuff here. um you know so there's like one for the course there's um you know there's one that helped me create these things called lightning lessons which is basically like you know this lead magnet um so there's all kinds of stuff like this um one I see you and I share uh general counsel here oh okay with claude AI oh yeah right exactly yeah there you go um so there's that and also have like you know my own software that I have. Yeah. Um, so I have uh let me see I can find it. I mean it's not I'm not really advertising it, but I have like YouTube chapter creation and then I I basically have this thing that um will create blog posts like out of YouTube videos. So like um let me show you an example. So uh like this one basically what I do is I take a YouTube video and it becomes an annotated presentation. So you don't have to watch the video. Yep. Like you can just especially if the video has slides, what it'll do is screenshot all the slides and then have a summary under each slide about what was said. So you can consume like a one hour presentation in like you know whatever five minutes. Um and that's really good because like you know I have I teach a lot and I have a lot of content and so I distribute notes so all of that. So like a lot of that stuff educational stuff is part of my workflow. Um, and that this is used like this uses Gemini. Essentially what it does is it pulls the transcript, it pulls the video, I can put in the slides all at once and get have a lot of examples and I give it to it and it produces this. Yeah, I've heard this in a couple podcasts that we've done recently that folks really like Gemini for video information. Ingest seems to be the fan favorite for taking basically YouTube videos or other video content and turning it into text or other other applications that you can extract from that. So try the Gemini models for that folks if you're Yeah, it's absolutely brilliant. It's amazing. Cool. Okay, so you have cloud projects for every little part of your business. I love the proposal workflow. It's something that we we we folks that do enterprise sales could probably make make some use out of. I'm about to start doing blog posts on all the how I AI podcast. So maybe I will download your repo and give that a little spin. And then you're using um Gemini models to extract out content and share it as as templates. And then you have oh look at these prompts. Got a GitHub with promps. Yeah. So I get GitHub with prompts. This one is private but just to give you an idea conceptually like I it's basically a monor repo of everything. Um, the reason that is is because I like to have clawed code, open hands, you name it. And basically what I say is because all these things are all interrelated, right? Like a lot of these projects. So like, you know, uh this is my my blog is in here. This is my blog for example. This is that that like YouTube thing I just showed you. This Hamill project. This is like something else that fetches Discord. This is about copywriting proposals, whatever. And I just point AI at this repo and you know there's like claw rules in here that says like okay what is this repo about and like where do you find stuff like okay you know this is like if you need to like for writing you should look here um you know so on and so forth. So my friend you have buried the lead here because we could have done an entire episode on just this repo. What this makes me think of is, you know, five five years ago there is this big like notetaking second brain. Where do you put all your information so you can have access to it forever? And I see this and my little engineering brain goes obviously it should go in a repo and it should be a combination of data sources, notes, articles, things that I've written, things that I like and prompts and tools to actually do something with that. So you have given me a personal project that I'm going to go work on in the next couple days because I think this is this is how I as somebody who lives with cursor or cloud code as sort of co-pilots for everything I do. This is how I would want to organize my data and my prompts to be able to do something with it. Yeah. I don't want to be locked in right like to any one provider. And so this is how I do that essentially. Amazing. Okay. We might have to have you back to go through this thing in detail. This has been so great. Um, I have two lightning round questions for you and then I will get you out of here. I know you're a busy guy. My first question is, you know, a lot of what you showed us requires someone, a person to go through with their human eyes, read things, and evaluate. And I'm curious, whose role do you think this is? Is this the product manager's role? Is it the engineer's role? Is it the subject matter expert's role? Who who does this? I think the subject matter expert is very central. A lot of times the product manager is the subject matter expert in a theme in a lot of organizations like they're kind of the person that everyone looks to for like the taste of like hey this is what should be happening with the user. So I would say a lot of times it is the product manager um that should be doing that annotation. Now when it gets into the analysis it's really interesting. It would be good if a product manager like the more you can do the better just like the SQL and the stuff that you know about at some point you do need probably need a data scientist when it gets advanced. Um but you know the more you learn the better and vice versa the more data scientists learn more product skills you know it's going to be better. It's hard to predict like you would you know there's always this tension or this kind of okay can we collapse roles can we collapse the product role and this like data scientist type AI role I'm not sure um it's yet to be seen I don't think so um there's a lot of surface area actually there's like there's something called AI engineer there's AI product manager and there's not there's also like still this data scientist aspect so those three roles are still operating on this problem. Um, and there's there's definitely a lot of service area for all of them, especially as you scale. The the one other thing that I would call out or my hope is in addition to sort of like the technical building teams who are sort of proxies in in my mind for the subject matter experts. So, a lot of times the product manager is a proxy for like the leasing agent in this example. They understand that user, they understand what high quality is. But, you know, I would really love to see folks that are in operational or more functional roles come in and actually contribute to the quality of the products because you know what makes a good user experience. You know what makes a good leasing agent. You know how they should speak and what they should do. And I think there is an opportunity for folks to lean in and bring that expertise to bear in a way that scales across a company. Um that if you're willing and brave to do it, I think product teams would welcome in. um kind of like non-technical colleagues into this process to add some more kind of user empathy and subject matter expertise. Yeah, definitely. Yeah, the more you can bring like the actual required taste in the product sense into the process, the more that Yeah, because that's essentially what you're doing when you're annotating. Yep. Doing this error analysis and the error analysis is the foundation for everything. Yep. Okay. And then my final question ask everybody. I know you're very structured and you'll tell me you'll look at the data and then figure out exactly what to say, but you have to admit sometimes AI is very frustrating and doesn't do what you want it to. Do you have any back pocket uh prompting techniques you use? Do you yell? Are you all caps? What What's your What's your strategy? AI has frustrated me the most is writing. Mhm. Cuz like writing I don't want the writing to sound like AI. Yeah. And it's hard, you know, that's the last thing you want in certain situations for your writing to sound like AI. And not that AI is like wrong, it's just that yeah, you want to make sure your like flavor is coming across. And so, um, so one thing, one thing is like, okay, I showed you my writing prompt, a little bit of it. I can share it with you separately also is like provide lots of examples, but then also take it step by step. So for writing, what I do is have it write an outline and then I have it write the first one or two sections and edit it very carefully. Now one tip is use something like AI Studio that allows you to edit the output of what the LLM is giving you. That's really important because like what that ends up doing is it creates examples for the LLM in kind of right there. Yeah. In line. Yep. Yeah. And so, um, yeah, you want to edit the output and, you know, yeah, something like a notebook or AI studio, there's not too many things that let you edit the output. Um, but once you do that, once you like do that hard work of like that those examples, especially like the thing you're trying to write now, then it starts to work really well. Yeah, it was one of the most important things that I built into my my AI product was every asset that gets generated has a real-time editor for the user to update and then those updates go back into the model because I just think if the central value proposition your product is writing, which mine is, it's one of the hardest stylistic challenges I've seen AI struggle with, it all sounds like slop. Like I can identify AI writing from a mile away. And so yeah, I found this like um incremental optimization. First outline, then draft, then edit, then refine process takes a while. Um there's some latency in the experience, but it ends up netting higher quality. And then just like use it as a draft, edit it, get the system guess get the system to be better. So that's really really great feedback. Is this for chat PRD? This is for chatd. Yep. Yeah. Very cool. Yeah. You know, I have high standards for writing, too. So it was important to me. Well, this was so great. Where can we find you and how can we be helpful? Yeah, haml.dev is my website. You can also find me Hamill Hussein on Twitter and yeah, I'm teaching a course on Maven as you know uh about eval subjects and very deeply. Um but yeah, that's where to find me. Great. Yeah, and for our listeners that don't know, Lenny's list is on Maven, including a how I AI section that I think features your course. So, you can check it out there. Thank you so much for the time. It was super educational, very practical. I'm going to take these tips right away and go improve my own product. Have a great day. Yeah, thank you for having me on. Thanks so much for watching.
