hey this is Daria I got quite a bit of backlash on the statement that I made in my first video where I said that I do not recommend front-end developer ux and UI roles to those of you who are looking to enter the tech field in 2025 feelings have been hurt there are quite a few people the role and the complexity of the role of a ux designer and a front-end developer especially under my shorts so let's address that and also talk about the main theme of this video how to choose a career in Tech if you don't know where to start or cannot seem to find your calling I'm filming this video for a few profiles of people number one early career professionals University grads or even perhaps high school students and number two the people who are thinking about doing a career pivot for whatever reason and they're thinking about tech so let me start by saying that you do not need need a dream and you do not need a calling otherwise you risk your entire life searching for one while life passes You by and you keep living paycheck to paycheck just a bit of background on myself I was a kid who did not know what to pick when I was approaching the end of high school and thinking about what I would want to major in I had absolutely no idea and the reason I had no idea is because my parents never really instilled any sort of standard path in me there was no such thing as when you grow up you have to become insert whatever it is that they wanted there were two things they asked of me I had to study hard and develop a high intellect number two they asked me to become extremely competent in whatever it is that I choose to do because when you are very competent you're going to be very confident so on one hand I was very lucky to not be programmed into a certain career on the other hand when most of my friends had their dream job job or something that they really wanted to pursue After High School I was completely lost I could do sciences I could do stats I could do business I could do whatever I wanted I was even considering a career of a classical musician but the problem is I did not have a dream of what I wanted to become and guess what I picked when I went to College culinary arts and Hospitality watched way too much Master Chef France and thought that I would become the next puku I thought being a chef is pretty much like being a chemist and an artist two in one and have an insanely creative mind where you get to work with things like heat cold fats acids Vapor all kinds of textures components and variations of those components to invoke emotions in another human being yeah thank God I went to work at a restaurant two weeks into that program and a couple of days made me realize that that was not what I wanted to do with my life I don't regret it it taught me a lot how glamorized depiction of a job can differ from what is really happening in the industry and I quit that program without even finishing the first semester I still find it fascinating to watch how big restaurants operate but thank God I'm not doing it for a living my parents knew nothing about that industry they wanted me to be happy and I did not think of talking to anybody who actually worked in the culinary industry at the time and had I done proper research I would have never picked that even though I do like the restaurant industry and I do like culinary arts there is a reason why France and Italy are the culinary capitals of Europe it has a lot to do with the terroir with the climate with the livestock they have and with the eating culture in those countries the last thing I was thinking at the time was researching the economics of a restaurant the fact that it is one of the riskiest businesses to run because your main asset the food expires in 3 to 4 days and the fact that it is a business with very low profitability now you may argue and say well if we're talking about food and drink you may just open another franchise of McDonald's sure but frankly that goes against my own beliefs around authenticity and a character in a business in retrospect I I realized that I was probably one of the luckiest kids exactly because I did not know what to pick I had one end goal and that was to be very successful financially I did not have this dream Quantified I did not know how much money I needed I could really feel the difference between $100 million And1 billion at that age I mean I could do the math and see the difference between the numbers but I had no idea between lifestyle differences and impact that someone with $100 million could do and someone with1 billion do could do I didn't know how to get there I didn't know what I wanted to do all I knew is that I wanted to become very successful financially in an ethical way and I was open to pretty much any career that would get me there in the shortest period of time so I quit culinary school and went to study business I was hustling non-stop to Kickstart My Career as soon as possible and I ended up Landing my first full-time role in Tech at 19 well before I finished college and that job happened to be at a tech company I don't want to say that I was very lucky to have been able to start a full-time gig at 19 that wasn't luck that was a lot of hard work but you know how many college kids get to work Barista jobs or sales associates and they don't get to experience the full-time version of whatever it is that they're studying until they're either Graduate University or very close to graduating college or university and only when you're reaching that level when you're about to graduate you start to actually research things such as salary for example and salary an easy one cuz even a lot of high school kids look into salaries to have an understanding of what they're going to be making but things like applying for jobs and realizing how difficult it actually is to land one looking at the state of the job market looking at the competition looking at the number of open roles looking at the structure of the teams they will be joining all of that usually happens when you're almost done studying for whatever it is that you've picked what did my first job teach me number one Business Degree was not enough at least not for me I felt a significant academic Gap and I knew that I would be going back to school number two I realized how much money you could be making in Tech and I knew that the industry was right I did not have a strong push but instead of making the same mistakes that I made when I was 17 I chose to sit down and do my research so to all people who feel lost and don't know what to choose and don't feel that inner push towards anything congratulations you won the golden ticket you were completely avoiding the possibility of falling in love with a craft only to find out that to have a passion for something and to do it for a living are two different things now what should you do if this is you right now be very strategic and very pragmatic about your next steps there are plenty of jobs that are emerging right now that were not a thing 5 years ago even my job product management was not a thing 10 years ago I mean it was a thing but it was very rare and there are even more jobs that will keep popping up in the next 5 to 10 years that we don't know about so what you need to do is to not only pick a job that will keep you afloat for the next 5 to 10 years but something that will make you future proof how to assess which Tech Career is worth pursuing number one research market conditions look into things such as Gardner hype cycle look what's trending look what will be trending for the jobs that are already plateauing you should know that there are plenty of talent in those jobs already and if you choose to enter those positions you will be competing with people who have been doing that job for a while and yes many of them have progressed into senior principal director VP level already so they're probably looking for junior talent but I don't have to tell you that technology is developing very fast not every Junior job is worth pursuing guys we are not in the 80s and not of it in 2000s the fact that people who have been building their careers in the industries that are currently plateauing have grown into principal or managerial roles does not mean that there is going to be a onetoone replacement I hope you understand that you see what's happening with thei on the market you see how many tasks are being automated the Tas tasks that are typically being performed by Junior people look for the number of open jobs of the role that you're targeting and look how it's been changing for the past couple of years and whether it's projected to grow two look into Data around layoffs you need to understand which jobs are being laid off right now and which ones are projected to be laid off and most importantly why people are being laid off it's one thing to be laid off if a company is readjusting their priorities and needs to save money it's another thing when half of the responsibilities of this job can now be performed by an AI agent number three look into Innovation conditions what part of your target role can be automated and also when you enter the field you will probably be entering it as a junior specialist so what percentage of a junior specialist responsibilities can be automated in the next 5 to 10 years actually not even 5 to 10 I want to say 3 to five now I promised you to talk about the backlash I got on my statement around front-end development let's look at this data the number of job postings dropped by 70% now senior full stack developers will not go away they have nothing to worry about at least for now but II technology such as Transformer based models like gb4 gbt 4.5 are increasingly automating certain coding tasks not all of them but some and a lot of those simple coding tasks are typically being done by Junior devs the real challenge for junior devs is not so much the fact that they're going to be replaced by AI but rather increased expectations for self-sufficiency many companies now prefer mid-level to senior level devs who can perform tasks end to end and that makes it harder for juniors to enter their first role in software development you have to be real about the conditions of the Innovation people are creating their own apps these days without being able to write a single line of production ready code this is not to say that the job of a front-end developer is easy this is not to say that CSS is easy there were people saying how only someone who has never done CSS before can say that front-end development is easy I am not saying that it's easy what I'm saying is that if I had a 20-year-old or a 40-year-old looking to switch jobs talking to me and asking for advice on which job to enter I would not be recommending front-end development because first of all they're going to have a very hard time Landing that first job and they may lose all motivation they had number two even if the land the job they're going to struggle big time in the next 3 to 5 years because they will have to upskill dramatically am I worried about my job not really again because I'm not Junior but even I am doing a ton of upscaling on the side and I am fully prepared for the world where my position doesn't exist anymore and should something happen to my role I can diversify the roles I'm applying for in the future so say what you will but I stand by what I said number four look at employment conditions what team you're you're going to be a part of how many open jobs are available on a team when you start applying what does the hierarchy look like is there a junior middle senior principal like what does that look like now going back to the ux example ux has one spot per team so if you were to enter ux in 2025 and look at the hype cycle and do your research about the market you should also add to it the fact that you will be competing for one job on a product development team there is nothing wrong with ux there is nothing wrong with this job it is a very important job it is a necessary part of the product development life cycle and I've gotten some comments under my videos saying well you're saying not to pursue ux but the design of half of my apps that I have my phone is still pretty crappy so how come we don't need designers even though the current apps even the current apps are not perfect in terms of ux well to that I say do you think that the design of the apps that are commonly used is crappy because there are no good designers who can create good design or maybe just maybe designers are not the ones who dictate what the company should invest into or perhaps it is not fully up to ux to decide how the app is going to look like because companies have other priorities and if the design is good enough they just move on and invest in something else if you happen to be at a company that prioritizes ux fantastic but most companies especially B2B aren't ux driven on top of that we are in the era where software as a service is a very developed industry and lots of apps repeat themselves if you're lucky enough to join a company that is building something Innovative something that the world hasn't seen before amazing but the rest of you will be learning from the existing patterns and repeating similar patterns in their own products those patterns are exactly what makes ux prototyping a lot easier these days so much so that even a non-er can do those things by themselves again this is not to say that ux is a necessary job this is to say that the need for junior ux designers is on the decline number five Market saturation and entry conditions like I said if you are about to enter a job with a low barrier to entry you should be expecting a very high competition and a very long time looking for a job ux happens to be a popular job for people who want to enter the tech industry without having to code and you may argue that a good uxer should have a very good knowledge of front-end development all of that is true but let's be honest a lot of people think about ux because they don't want to code if ux is something you truly want to do for the rest of your life because you are artistic you feel that inner talent and push towards ux do your research about how this job is changing and develop a skill set that will be very difficult to replace of course you cannot predict what new AI is going to come out a couple of years from now but if you're already seeing people who were unable to produce their own designs or unable to write code build their own apps with Claud or gbt you can make a conclusion that a front-end developer or a ux designer with a very standard skill set does not have a very long career trajectory the ones that are already in the industry need to upscale let alone those who are thinking about entering it number six compensation I'm very biased here so take this with a grain of salt I do not relate to people who want to have a chill life and just enough money to pay the bills there is absolutely nothing wrong with that it's just it's not me this is the view that I apply to everything I'm talking about on this channel I want people and especially young people to have a very high quality of life I want more people to not have to worry about money and be able to spend their energy on things that are going to make this world better I want more Youth Travel further than the country they were born in I want more people to have an ability to take risks and build their own businesses the description of this channel says I want to help people build a financially rewarding career so no I am not recommending jobs that will pay you 150k at the peak of the career because there are jobs that pay 100K for entry level roles and I know it's very fashionable ble to say how you should not take anything for granted and you should be grateful for every dollar and not speak about money like that I am grateful for everything I have and I don't want to be playing a victim and I was also making $25 and $30,000 and I was very happy when I was making that money because I was making it by myself nobody gave it to me I was making it with my own brain but having ambition does not mean you're going to be taking everything for granted having ambition does not mean that you're not going to be grateful for every dollar you're making so no I cannot relate to people who want to enter Tech and make 50 Grand I don't and number seven transferability of skills you should be fully prepared for what's to come if your job disappears a couple of years from now the skill set that you're developing should give you at least a few career paths that you can have in mind if you pursue computer science you can pivot into data science you can go to software engineering you can go into devops it there's multiple paths you can pursue cyber security is one of them as well if you're in product management you can easily jump into growth if you're more technical you can go to software development or data science you can switch to marketing there's a few paths there as well if you limit your training to a frontend developer skill set and this job sees us to exist tomorrow you're going to have a very hard time relearning what what you need to know for other adjacent roles so might as well do the harder thing at the beginning of your career and perhaps start as a frontend Dev but be able to grow rather than getting stuck in this role and not knowing what to do if you get laid off or if the job disappears I got a comment under my last video from a young person saying that they were thinking about getting into ux because they were looking for a job in Tech that would require coding I responded to them in comments but what I wanted to repeat is that that when you put that kind of a condition no coding on your job search or on Career planning you should understand that if you put those conditions in one row Tech job no coding High salary you're signing up for one of the following scenarios one you get a job that requires a big set of soft skills for example sales sales people make a lot of money and don't code but let's be honest not everybody can do sales so while sales does not have a high barrier to entry in terms of technical skills you got to have a very thick skin to survive sales and the beauty of this job is that it can be done at any age by anyone coming from any background but you have to learn how to sell it is not an easy skill to learn yeah they don't need to code but go and try making a living by convincing others to buy from you frankly I don't know what's easier learning data signs or learning how to sell depends on your personality or two you pick a job that doesn't require hard technical skills and doesn't require very specific soft skills like sales what are we left with ux and probably technical project management and if you were to pursue that route what do you get in return much higher competition and lesser salaries because there is more Supply than demand and I don't want to be making any generalized statements based on the people I know because I know that it's just it's a tiny sample of of this group that I personally know but of the people that I have met in real life the people that I you know have a certain connection with I can name at least nine who were looking for a ux job for over a year and did not land one why did I pick product because it is the only job on a product development team that makes as much as engineering has a very high transferability of skills and it is the best job if your end goal is entrepreneurship which is my case so if you take into consideration everything I told you about myself having a job that will prepare me for entrepreneurship better than anything else and give me a high salary to give myself an opportunity to live a joyful full of energy full of memories life I think I made the best choice but I again I made my choice 70 years ago if I were to do this again in 2025 I don't think I would be going for product management if I imagine myself being 17 again I would not be resistant to learning technical skills because even if you feel like you're going to be struggling a lot it's short-term pain for a long-term gain this is my own bias I completely recognize that but I feel like a lot of people are not willing to pursue technical jobs not because they don't have an aptitude for technical abilities but because of a mental block it's more fear than actual difficulty if you want to pursue a career of a cyber security business professional who will not be a cyber security engineer but someone responsible for introducing cyber security projects into an organization you're not going to have to code every single day you're not going to have to code at all but that technical Acumen will be part of your training and a lot of people completely dismiss the careers that are Adent to Ai and Technical Fields only because that Technical Training will be part of the curriculum I completely understand that there is that fear of failure fear of not belonging in the technical community but if you find a well structured course with instructor or no instructor whatever you prefer and realtime feedback I am certain that a lot more people would actually grow to love it and find it very intellectually stimul stimulating if they were to shut down that mental block and actually give it a try you have to understand applications of avoiding hard things there are no jobs in Tech that you don't have to study hard for don't have to sacrifice anything for and that would pay you a ton of money I'm a big believer in hard work and I want to motivate people to find that inner fire and inner ambition to pursue things that are hard because the reward is worth it I did not create this channel to preach average income and average career be highly calculated and highly pragmatic about your life don't be afraid of difficulties because while you're wasting time worrying about things that you haven't experienced yet someone's already doing it do hard things and be honest with yourself with best case and worst case scenarios for the next 10 years this is a very interesting topic for me and I really hope that this video helps people who feel lost as well as younger people who graduate universities and are not sure about what to do next I would love to hear from you guys if you have any questions please ping me I will make sure to answer every single one of you till next time bye
