- As humans, we all want the same thing,
a life that's full of good experiences,
more time with family, with friends,
more time to love,
but sometimes genetic
illness can cut that short
or really, for all of us at some point,
our body breaks down.
And our bodies are genetic machines.
For many diseases, the
cause of the disease
is a mutation in the genome.
Gene therapy is a vision that
many have had for decades,
more than 50 years.
The power of genetic technology is that
once you get inside of
cells with a DNA molecule,
that molecule can stay there
for the lifetime of the cell.
So it's the potential
for a one-time treatment
for a disease where you wouldn't otherwise
be able to reach the cells
and solve for the root
cause of the disease.
Today though, for the most part,
the genome you're born with
is the genome you die with.
Access to this molecular level
is out of reach for almost all of us.
We've tried many different things,
but have really struggled
to be able to get
enough of the genetic
payload into the cells
where they're gonna be
effective as a therapeutic.
And it's getting inside of the cells
that has really been a
challenge for many, many years.
I'm Eric Kelsic, CEO and
co-founder at Dyno Therapeutics.
For the past 10 years, I've been working
to solve the grand
challenge of gene delivery.
How are we gonna make gene therapy
a mainstream kind of medicine?
We need to solve these grand
challenges like delivery,
being able to deliver
a therapeutic payload
to every organ or every cell
where there might be some
benefit to patient health.
To do that, we're
engineering protein shells
derived from viruses.
Capsids are the protein shells
of adeno-associated virus.
AAVs, adeno-associated virus,
is a parasite of other viruses.
AAV naturally isn't known
to cause any disease.
The reason why AAV gets a lot of attention
is because it's one of
the smallest viruses,
and that enables it to get into
many places all across the body
where we need to deliver
a therapeutic DNA.
We still don't know a lot about
how it functions naturally.
That said, we don't need to understand
everything about how the virus works
in order to adapt it as
a therapeutic technology,
and that's our focus at Dyno,
engineering the capsid sequence
to make capsids a better delivery vehicle
for gene therapies.
What's amazing about capsids
is they're evolved in nature
to do so many different things.
So they can go through your
body, through the blood,
find a cell, enter the cell,
and then be released
into the cell cytoplasm,
get into the nucleus
through the nuclear pore,
break open the capsid
and release the genome,
and that's where it expresses.
So for a gene therapy, going
from the blood, into cells,
into the cytoplasm, into the nucleus,
and then expressing the genetic payload,
that's entirely the goal.
And when therapeutic genes
are expressed in the nucleus,
they can be treating those cells
for a patient's entire lifetime.
As a one-time treatment, it
can be an effective cure.
However, natural capsids,
they're not efficient enough
for most therapeutic purposes.
So for the past 28 years,
protein engineers have been
working to modify the capsid
to make it better as
a therapeutic protein,
applying a technique
called directed evolution.
Directed evolution is
evolution like occurs in nature
but for a goal that we choose,
and the most common
approach there had been to
randomly change the capsid sequence
to make very large libraries,
millions or even billions of different
capsid sequence molecules.
With a very low quality
library, but a very large one,
you have a chance of getting a good hit,
but it's like a needle in a haystack.
And the reason is because the capsid has
many different functions,
and if you break even one of them,
then, as a therapeutic,
it's essentially useless.
Roughly 80% of the single changes
that you could make to the capsid
break the most essential function,
which is the assembly and
packaging of the genome.
What that means is that, if by
chance you make any mutation,
four out of five times, it's
gonna break the function.
And that's a problem
for engineering because,
to get improved function,
we're gonna need to make multiple changes,
maybe even hundreds of changes.
So if every time you make a change,
the viability drops down,
it's really hard to have
a library of changes that are going to
do a chance of finding an improved capsid.
And that's just the basics.
You need to be able to
produce and purify that capsid at scale.
It needs to be stable at
low temperature or frozen,
but even when it's in your body,
which is a relatively high temperature,
it also needs to get into the right cells.
For example, there's a lot of unmet need
for gene therapy in the brain
because it's very difficult
to get therapeutic proteins
or other molecules across
the blood-brain barrier.
At a high dose, you might
be able to get into .1%
or maybe a little bit more
of the neurons in the brain.
That's not enough to treat many diseases.
And in addition to that,
most of the capsid delivers
its payload to the liver.
And at a high enough dose,
that can also become toxic.
We need to improve the
efficiency of delivery
to the target cell.
Over decades of trying this approach,
we just didn't get
enough improved variants
or variants that were optimized
for all the different
functions that were needed
to make them effective as gene therapies.
I had seen that there was a
new wave of technologies coming
with the potential to change
the way that we engineer
proteins completely.
It starts with this DNA
multiplexing technology.
So we have an idea of an
experiment we want to run,
testing many different capsids.
They might be designed to
bind to a certain receptor
or they might be designed
in a neighborhood of sequence space
that before we found is promising.
And we came up with a way of
building very large libraries of
capsids in which the
sequence was programmed,
meaning we had designed it on a computer,
synthesized that DNA,
and then cloned it into the capsid,
so this could be injected in a few mLs.
The best way we have to make a prediction
about what's gonna be safe
and effective for humans
is to do an animal experiment.
We do most of our screening
in non-human primates,
especially in cynomolgus monkeys.
That's one reason why we
developed this technology
because their lives
are also very precious.
We wanna get as much information as we can
from even one experiment.
In this case, we're measuring
maybe a hundred or two hundred thousand,
sometimes even a million
different capsid sequences
in that one animal.
We'll get all these tissues back
from our animal experiments,
and then we wanna learn as much as we can
from that experiment,
meaning look at every organ.
Where did the capsids go
or where did they not go?
Extract the nucleic acids,
purify the DNA, purify the RNA.
You can then work all the way back to
what was the capsid sequence
that this molecule corresponds to?
Is there more or less
of that in the library?
And if there's more, that might mean that
it was functionally improved for delivery.
If there's less, it might
mean that there was a problem
and it was broken.
We do this across all of our library.
At Dyno today we've got petabytes of data
from the DNA sequencing.
I had always thought that proteins,
they're too complex for us
to understand as humans,
certainly too complex
for me to understand.
When you look at a string of 735 letters,
it's really hard to notice
all the differences.
But with all that data, what
I could see, even myself, was
there's a lot of patterns in that data,
patterns about which amino
acids work at each position.
My thought was that if I
could recognize those patterns
and the data set is so vast,
there's probably a lot more
information in them as well.
That's actually the
perfect type of problem
for a machine learning model.
We can use AI to automate
the analysis of all that data
and to find even more nuanced patterns
to maximize the chances of success,
the expected value of
finding an improved variant.
We call that AI-guided design.
But once we have that data
and we've trained models on it,
we can now query those models
billions and billions of times.
So our ability to scale
the computational work
is even higher than the molecular side.
We can't possibly test
everything in an experiment.
But with machine learning,
we can test many different
sequences in silico,
meaning on a computer,
and the models will tell us which ones
they think are better,
or we might try many models,
tens or hundreds of different models
that each have a different insight.
And we compare the opinions
of all those different experts
to choose the ones that
we're very confident
are worth investing in
as we bring them forward
into the next experiment.
So it's this iterative cycle
of making libraries in DNA,
measuring their properties,
then building models
to analyze and understand
those properties.
Then querying the models to know
where are the most promising regions
of sequence space that we should go next.
And then going back to
design a new library,
turning that into DNA.
We're using a lot of technology,
but there's always human
judgment at some point
before we do another round of experiments.
I think that, over time, what we wanna do
is put humans at an even
higher point of leverage
so that they're able to use
their exceptional judgment
and shift some of the more
routine tasks to AI agents
or even just to simple scripts
that run on the computer.
Being able to collaborate
with AIs more effectively
is where we'd like to go so that we can,
for example, give instructions to the AI
to automate how we analyze the
library or how we design it
and get back the answers that we expect.
We wanna get the results
as fast as we can.
Patients are waiting for better medicines.
We wanna make sure that,
if there's anything wrong,
we catch it quickly,
and for that, we need a human in the loop.
The power of genetic technology is that
once you get inside of
cells with a DNA molecule,
that molecule can stay there
for the lifetime of the cell.
So for example, in the neurons
where they're not dividing,
getting the right therapeutic
DNA sequence into the neuron
can be effectively a cure for
a patient's entire lifetime.
That's the reason why at Dyno,
and myself personally, and many of us
are so excited about the
potential of gene therapy.
A good example of this would be Zolgensma,
which is now an approved medicine
and was really a breakthrough drug.
SMA, spinal muscular atrophy,
was the leading cause of death
from a genetic disease in
children prior to this treatment.
The problem is that the SMN1 gene
is not functional in patients.
This disease, prior to gene
therapy, was always fatal
at a very young age. Children would die
usually around two or three years old.
With Zolgensma though,
if children are treated very early,
in the first few weeks of life, say,
the gene therapy can restore
the function of that gene.
It can, with a one-time treatment,
completely cure the disease.
And it's an example of the
amazing potential of gene therapy.
What's unfortunate is that there's,
today, just a handful of
FDA-approved gene therapies,
but there's thousands of genetic diseases
that we know about, 7,000 or more.
And for most of them,
we have no good treatment
options available.
What we want to be able to do
with our capsid engineering work,
by solving deliveries,
make it easier to get into
all the cells that will
enable us to then apply
the knowledge we have
from genome sequencing
and from systems biology
to develop therapies that are gonna treat
the underlying cause of those diseases.
Today, most of our attention,
most of the industry's attention
is focused on a smaller
number of diseases,
diseases that could benefit more patients,
and where the markets are large enough
to justify commercial investment.
There's also a long tail of
rare and ultra-rare diseases
where there might only be 10
or even a single patient
in the entire world
who has a certain disease.
Today, gene therapies are very expensive.
A single dose might cost
millions of dollars.
Our goal is to bring the cost
of delivery down to zero,
or very, very close to it.
To do that, we also need
to enable there to be
many more genetic medicines
so that there's good
competition between developers.
We can also look to other
industries where there's been
really dramatic changes
in the cost efficiencies
and the scale economies over time.
One of them is in semiconductors,
as we've been able to dramatically improve
the number of transistors
that you can put on a chip.
Other areas like solar where
we'd been able to bring the cost down
more than 200 fold over five decades
and increase deployment
over 100,000 times.
These phenomena are all
called Wright's Law,
which is basically that with
every doubling of production,
there's a percentage decrease in the cost.
And in gene therapy,
I think there will be something similar.
So we can go from a gene
therapy that might cost
hundreds of thousands of dollars
down to something that costs $10,000
or even $1,000 to develop.
To the point where rare
diseases or ultra-rare diseases,
non-profit efforts could be fully funding
the treatments for patients.
Obviously, there's a lot
of things we need to do
in order to achieve that.
Solving delivery is just one of them.
The therapies are complex
and we don't understand exactly how to
design them in a way they're
gonna work in humans,
but AI may be part of that solution
because if an AI could design
a therapy just for one patient
and customize it to their genome sequence,
customize it to their goals,
that could be done on-demand,
and that AI could even chart out
how to develop the
therapy, how to produce it,
how to test it, how to
ensure that it's safe.
This could be done in a
massively scalable way.
And I think that's the
path that we can use
to solve for the long tail of disease
and to help patients who, today,
we understand their genetics.
We know what the problem is.
We even, in many cases, know how to design
a therapy that could help them,
but we need to be able to bring that
to the patient directly,
and AI is a way that
they can get the benefit
from all this innovation
in a way that's economically affordable.
As there's more gene therapies,
one thing that we may want to do is
to be able to reset or
remove prior gene therapies.
It's far away because it's
not the urgent priority today.
But for a future with genetic agency
where patients are making the best choice
for them to live a healthy life,
they may want to be able to
upgrade their therapy in time.
This ability to reset would
give them that potential.
For example, if there's a new approach
that's even more effective,
a patient wouldn't think
twice about taking that now,
knowing that they could
remove it in the future
and replace it with a better therapy
that might come along in 10 or 20 years.
That makes gene therapy a
much more routine decision.
What that means is that
we can think about genetic technologies
less as really a part of us,
but just something that we choose to use
in the same way that I might
wear one set of clothes a day
or a different set next year,
but that's not really part of who I am.
And I think about that
very differently than
today how I think about my genome,
which has always been a part of me.
And up until very recently,
I thought I would die
with the same genome that I was born with.
Because of the genetic technologies,
I think we're gonna no longer
associate the genetics that
we have with who we are,
and it's more a decision
for who we want to be
or what we want to become,
and you'll be able to have
much more control over that
so you can live the
very best possible life.
