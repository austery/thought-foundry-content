One of the things that really worries me is the way in which young men and young women have been increasingly persuaded that their problems are the fault of the other side. So on the right there's a strong tendency I think to say to young men, "Yeah, you're struggling." Which is true. And you know why? It's because of all those women uh taking jobs, taking positions. Feminism's gone too far, etc. and almost blame women or the rise of women for the problems of men, which is very reactionary. But I would say it's true the other way around, too. I think that many people on the political left have said to young women, "Sure, you're struggling. You're not going to earn as much and the labor market, it doesn't work as well for you, and you quite rightly have may have some fears for your own prospects." And you know why? Because of those men. Because of patriarchy, because of toxic masculinity. And so, weirdly, both sides have managed to politicize young men and young women almost against each other just at a moment in history where you'd want young people to be arm- in-armm against the structural problems that they're facing in the economy. I'm not saying it's a conspiracy, but if it was a conspiracy, what you would do is you'd find a way to persuade young men and young women that what was happening was the fault of of the of the other side of the gender divide rather than the fault of the economy. or our healthare system or the labor market, right? Um, and so I think in different ways the politics of the of gender have ended up becoming really way too personal and not structural enough.
