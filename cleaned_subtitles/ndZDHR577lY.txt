had an episode earlier 讲的是保守党党魁博励治 Talking about the Conservative Party leader, Pierre Poilievre 他的个人背景 以及他的执政理念 His personal background and governing philosophy 于是就有观众在留言区跟我说 So, some viewers left comments saying 庄也你看你 Zhuang Ye, look at you 向来做节目 You've always done your shows 总是吹嘘自己要尽量保持中立 Always boasting about trying to stay neutral 那么你讲完了博励治 So after you've covered Poilievre 你是不是也得应该讲一下 Shouldn't you also talk about 自由党这边 The Liberal Party side 虽说自由党党魁 现在还没选出来 Even though the Liberal Party leader hasn't been chosen yet 但是 But 你可以讲一讲那些排名比较靠前的 You could talk about those top-ranking 最有希望当选的候选人 Most likely candidates to win 说一说他们的个人背景以及执政理念 Discuss their personal backgrounds and governing philosophies 让我们心里有个数 So we can get a sense of things 这位观众朋友说的不错 This viewer friend makes a good point 虽说我个人的政治倾向 Although my personal political leanings 目前还是偏向保守党 Are currently inclined toward the Conservative Party 这个没有办法 There's no helping it 因为做节目可以中立 Because a show can be neutral 但是做节目的人 But the person making the show 他确实没有办法做到 Really can't manage to 一碗水绝对端平 Be completely impartial 不过这个 However, this 并不妨碍我介绍自由党这边的情况 Doesn't stop me from covering the Liberal Party side 更何况在加拿大的政治舞台上 What's more, on Canada's political stage 自由党 The Liberal Party 一直扮演着一个举足轻重的角色 Has always played a pivotal role 随着现任总理特鲁多 With the current Prime Minister Trudeau 在2025年1月6日宣布辞去党魁职务 Announcing his resignation as party leader on January 6, 2025 接下来的这几周 In the coming weeks 自由党党魁的竞选 The Liberal Party leadership race 也开始进入了白热化阶段 Has started to heat up 这场竞选 This contest 它不仅关乎着自由党党内领导人的更替 Is not just about the change of leadership within the Liberal Party 它也直接影响着 It also directly affects 加拿大未来的政治走向 Canada's future political direction 目前加入战团的一共有5位正式的候选人 There are currently five official candidates in the race 每个人都是在加拿大政坛上 Each one is a notable figure in Canadian politics 有一定能力的大咖 With considerable influence 尤其是其中排名前两位的 Especially the top two 马克.卡尼和方慧兰 Mark Carney and Chrystia Freeland 那更是现在加拿大政界高层 Who are currently the focus of Canada's political elite 以及老百姓们瞩目的焦点 And the public's attention 那么今天 So today 咱们就深入的探讨一下这几位候选人 We'll dive deep into these candidates 介绍一下每位候选人的个人经历 Introduce each candidate's personal background 执政理念 Governing philosophy 以及他们对加拿大未来的愿景 And their vision for Canada's future 因此说今天的节目非常的精彩 So today's show is going to be very exciting 将为您呈现一场 It will bring you 关于加拿大政治未来的深度剖析 An in-depth analysis of Canada's political future 好 咱们就废话少说 Alright, let's cut the chatter 直入主题 And get straight to the point 首先 先介绍一下 First, let's go over 关于这次自由党党魁竞选的 Some key details about this Liberal Party leadership race 一些大家比较关心的问题 That people are most curious about 第一个问题就是 The first question is 什么人可以获得自由党党内提名 Who can get nominated within the Liberal Party 有资格参加党魁竞选 To be eligible to run for party leader 这个其实是有门槛的 There are actually some thresholds for this 不是说庄也我今天注册加入自由党 It's not like I, Zhuang Ye, can register with the Liberal Party today 明天就可以参选的 And run for leader tomorrow 我这种情况 In my case 连去投票选举党魁的资格都没有 I wouldn't even be eligible to vote for the party leader 你还别说被选举了 Let alone be elected 你要想去投票的话 If you want to vote 你至少你得有41天的党龄 You need at least 41 days of party membership 而且其他条件也有 And there are other conditions too 你必须得是加拿大公民或者永久居民 You must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident 或者是本地原住民身份 Or have Indigenous status 而且不是其他政党的成员 And not be a member of another political party 并且至少年满14周岁 And be at least 14 years old 按这个条件筛选的话 With these criteria 目前加拿大全国 Across Canada right now 只有大约40万名自由党登记选民 There are only about 400,000 registered Liberal voters 是有资格参加投票的 Eligible to participate in the vote 咱们这些 Those of us 非自由党正式党员的 Who aren't official Liberal Party members 普通加拿大老百姓们 Ordinary Canadian citizens 也就别惦记着去投票了 Shouldn't even think about voting 好 这个只是投票权 Alright, that's just voting rights 你要是想参加竞选的话 If you want to run in the race 你就必须得获得党内的提名 You need to secure a nomination from within the party 获得提名的条件有那么几个 There are a few conditions for getting nominated 第一个你需要从已经注册的 First, you need to collect signatures from registered 现有的自由党人那里 Current Liberal Party members 收集到300个签名 Gather 300 signatures 而且其中至少有100个 And at least 100 of them 是来自三个不同的省份或者地区 Must come from three different provinces or territories 这个对我这种素人其实就比较难了 This is actually pretty tough for an outsider like me 你看我都不知道谁是党员 I mean, I don't even know who the party members are 我去哪搞这个名单 Where would I get that list 下一步更难了 The next step is even harder 候选人需要支付35万加币的入场费 Candidates need to pay a $350,000 entry fee 才能够参加竞选 To be able to run 这个费用不需要一次交齐 This fee doesn't have to be paid all at once 需要在1月23日到2月17日 It needs to be paid between January 23 and February 17 中间分四期支付 In four installments 头两次交5万加币 The first two payments are $50,000 each 后两次 每次交125,000 The last two are $125,000 each 就是一共35万加币 Totaling $350,000 你要是中间有一次断供 If you miss a payment along the way 那你就失去了竞选资格 You lose your eligibility to run 而且你前面已经交过的款 And the money you've already paid 除了最初交付的那个5万加币 Except for the initial $50,000 可以还给你之外 Which can be refunded to you 其他的钱 就算你爱心捐款了 The rest is considered a charitable donation 好 一个是300个签名 Alright, so one is 300 signatures 一个是35万加币的入场费 Another is the $350,000 entry fee 除了满足前两个条件之外 Beyond meeting these two conditions 这第三个条件 The third condition 就是你得需要得到自由党党内的批准 Is that you need approval from within the Liberal Party 这个主观性就比较强了 This one's a bit more subjective 所以说 So 比方说一个百万富翁 For example, a millionaire 手里有俩糟钱 With some cash to spare 35万嘛 也就是卖一辆豪车的价钱 $350,000 is just the price of selling a luxury car 然后临时加入自由党 Then they join the Liberal Party on a whim 串联了300个自由党签名的 And manage to gather 300 Liberal signatures 这种阿猫阿狗们 These random nobodies 这你想参加自由党竞选 If they want to run in the Liberal race 你没有名望 Without any reputation 你这最后一关你肯定过不去 You definitely won't pass this final hurdle 因此说您看上面这3个条件 So you see, with these three conditions 说白了 To put it plainly 就是这些候选人 These candidates 必须都得是自由党内的 Must all be deeply rooted 根深叶茂的名人才行 Well-established figures within the Liberal Party 其实自由党党内的人才还是很多的 Actually, there's no shortage of talent within the Liberal Party 你看自从1月6日特鲁多宣布辞职之后 Ever since Trudeau announced his resignation on January 6 自由党内是一通洗牌呀 There's been a major shake-up within the Liberal Party 之前呼声比较高的 Some previously high-profile 一些有望参选的党内大佬们 Party bigwigs who were expected to run 有的就是觉得自己资历不够 Some felt their qualifications weren't enough 不参加竞选 And chose not to run 这里面比较有代表性的 Among the more notable ones 你比方说 For example 特鲁多内阁中的内贸部长 Trudeau's cabinet Minister of Internal Trade 安妮塔.阿南德(Anita Anand） Anita Anand 以及创新科学和工业部部长商鹏飞(François-Philippe Champagne) And François-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry 以及前BC省省长简惠芝(Christy Clark) And former BC Premier Christy Clark 还有前移民部长 And the former Immigration Minister 前住房基建部 Former Housing and Infrastructure 部长肖恩.弗雷泽(Sean Fraser) Minister Sean Fraser 还有外交部长乔美兰(Mélanie Joly) And Foreign Affairs Minister Mélanie Joly 以及现任财政部长兼政府兼事务部 And the current Finance Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 部长多米尼克.勒布朗(Dominic LeBlanc) Minister Dominic LeBlanc 以及现任的那个移民部长马克.米勒(Marc Miller) And the current Immigration Minister Marc Miller 还有现任就业和劳工部长 And the current Employment and Labor Minister 史蒂文.麦金农（Steven MacKinnon） Steven MacKinnon 还有现任的能源和自然资源部部长 And the current Minister of Energy and Natural Resources 乔纳森.威尔金森（Jonathan Wilkinson） Jonathan Wilkinson 等等等等 And so on and so forth 这些人都不参选 None of these people are running 还有些人 就是已经高调宣布参加竞选 And some others had loudly announced their candidacy 但是后来因为种种原因 But later, for various reasons 不得不半道退出 Had to drop out halfway 这里面比较有代表性的一个 A notable example here 就是那个杰米.巴利斯特(Jaime Battiste) Is Jaime Battiste 他是加拿大历史上 He is the first in Canadian history 第一位竞选自由党领袖的 To run for Liberal Party leader 原住民出身的政治家 As an Indigenous politician 他是1月13日高调宣布参选 He loudly announced his candidacy on January 13 而且他的竞选的申请 And his candidacy application 也被自由党批准通过了 Was approved by the Liberal Party 可惜后来在1月30日宣布 Unfortunately, he announced on January 30 因为他没有筹集到 That because he couldn't raise 第二期的5万加币的资金 The $50,000 for the second installment 而不得不退出竞选 He had to withdraw from the race 第二位半道退出的是钱德拉.阿里亚(Chandra Arya) The second to drop out halfway was Chandra Arya 这位是一位印度裔的加拿大政治家 This is an Indian-origin Canadian politician 他是2006年才移民到加拿大的 He only immigrated to Canada in 2006 从政之前 Before entering politics 他是印度加拿大渥太华商会的主席 He was the president of the Indo-Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Ottawa 后来在2015年联邦大选中 Later, in the 2015 federal election 当选为 He was elected as 渥太华下面一个地方选区的国会议员 A Member of Parliament for a local riding under Ottawa 但是他没有进入内阁担任职务 But he didn't serve in the cabinet 等特鲁多辞职之后 After Trudeau resigned 他在1月9日宣布参选 He announced his candidacy on January 9 他虽然通过了前两关 Though he passed the first two hurdles 但是他没有通过第三关 He didn't pass the third 因为他被自由党投票委员会认为 Because the Liberal Party voting committee deemed 他明显不适合担任领导人 Him clearly unfit to serve as leader 就被踢出了竞选 So he was kicked out of the race 所以说 他走的也是心不甘情不愿的 So, he left quite reluctantly 他为什么被踢出来 Why was he kicked out 这个主要的问题 The main issue 就是因为在这个我私下里猜的 Is, based on my private guess 你看 说错了你别怪我 Look, don't blame me if I get it wrong 从他过往的经历看 Judging from his past experience 他是一个印度教的支持者 He is a supporter of Hinduism 向来对加拿大政坛上 And has always had issues with 比较有能量的锡克教 The relatively influential Sikh community in Canadian politics 抱有成见 Holding prejudices 所以说这样一位政治家 So a politician like this 政治不正确的政客 A politically incorrect figure 也不可能在加拿大政坛上更进一步 Couldn't possibly advance further in Canadian politics 除了前面说的这些没有参选的 Besides those who didn't run as mentioned earlier 以及半道退出的 And those who dropped out halfway 最后参与自由党党魁角逐的 The final contenders for the Liberal Party leadership 就剩下5位候选人 Are down to five candidates 他们分别是这个顺序 They are, in this order 咱们就按照民调 We'll go by the polls 从后往前 From back to front 按当选的可能性从小到大的顺序 In order of increasing likelihood of winning 咱们就先介绍不重要的 Let's start with the less significant ones 先介绍民调排名第五位的 First, introducing the candidate ranked fifth in the polls 弗兰克.贝利斯(Frank Baylis) Frank Baylis 这位老兄 This guy 他是生于1962年11月15日 Was born on November 15, 1962 是一位加拿大商人兼政治家 He is a Canadian businessman and politician 他的父亲是1956年从英国移民到加拿大 His father immigrated to Canada from the UK in 1956 他的母亲 His mother 是来自巴巴多斯 Came from Barbados 是1952年移民到加拿大的 And immigrated to Canada in 1952 所以说这位弗兰克.贝利斯 So this Frank Baylis 他是加拿大二代移民 Is a second-generation Canadian immigrant 他出生在蒙特利尔地区 He was born in the Montreal area 后来上大学之前 Before going to university 还曾经在多伦多待了一段时间 He spent some time in Toronto 然后 Then 他就考上了安省的滑铁卢大学 He got into the University of Waterloo in Ontario 在1986年 In 1986 顺利拿到了电气工程学学士学位 He successfully earned a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering 等毕业之后 After graduating 就加入了自己的家族企业 He joined his family business 因为他妈妈是护士 Because his mother was a nurse 在1980年代初 In the early 1980s 创建了一个贝利斯医疗公司 She founded Baylis Medical Company 听着挺大 It sounds impressive 其实一开始就是一个小的家庭作坊 But it started as a small family workshop 后来在1986年 Later, in 1986 升级成为一家医疗设备的进口与分销公司 It grew into a medical equipment import and distribution company 弗兰克.贝利斯就是在1989年 Frank Baylis joined in 1989 他大学毕业之后第三年 Three years after graduating university 加入了自己家开的 He joined his family's 这个贝利斯医疗公司 Baylis Medical Company 担任总裁 Serving as president 主要负责分销工作 Mainly handling distribution 后来估计干一段时间 觉得没意思了 Later, after some time, he probably got bored 他就弃商从政 So he left business for politics 在2015年的联邦选举中 In the 2015 federal election 他当选为 He was elected as 蒙特利尔地区的 A Member of Parliament for a Montreal-area 一个地方选区的国会议员 Local riding 但是四年之后的2019年 But four years later, in 2019 他没有竞选连任 He didn't run for re-election 而是又弃政从商 Instead, he left politics for business again 重返贝利斯医疗公司 Returning to Baylis Medical Company 就担任这个董事会执行主席 Serving as the executive chairman of the board 就是接下来就是好几年 And for the next few years 把这公司业务办的是有声有色 He ran the company's operations quite successfully 他也算是加拿大的一位 He's considered one of Canada's 在医疗设备领域比较成功的企业家 More successful entrepreneurs in the medical equipment field 另外除了医疗公司之外 Besides the medical company 他还搞了一些其他的业务 He also got involved in some other ventures 比方说 For example 涉及这个科研行业的税务咨询服务 Tax consulting services for the scientific research industry 以及涉足电影娱乐产业等等 And dabbling in the film and entertainment industry, among others 等这次特鲁多辞职之后 After Trudeau resigned this time 这位弗兰克.贝利斯 This Frank Baylis 他又卷土重来 Made a comeback 从商界又杀回政坛 Returning from business to politics 就在特鲁多宣布辞职的同一天 On the very same day Trudeau announced his resignation 1月6日 January 6 他也高调宣布参加自由党党魁竞选 He loudly announced his candidacy for Liberal Party leader 1月23日 On January 23 自由党党部批准了他的竞选资格 The Liberal Party approved his candidacy 他这次的竞选口号是 His campaign slogan this time is 为了所有加拿大人的繁荣 For the prosperity of all Canadians Prosperity for all Canadians 他的执政理念 His governing philosophy 我大概总结了一下 I've roughly summed it up 大致有这么几条 It includes a few key points 首先是政治方面的改革 First, political reform 就是对参议员和众议员的任期限制 Adjusting term limits for senators and MPs 进行一个调整 Making some changes 目的是把权力重新分配给国会议员们 To redistribute power back to Members of Parliament 而不是政党的领导人 Rather than party leaders 另外他还打算投资加拿大的大学 He also plans to invest in Canadian universities 企业和孵化器 Businesses, and incubators 减少政府债务 Reduce government debt 在国际政治上 In international politics 他是打算承认巴勒斯坦 He plans to recognize Palestine 并且对加沙的重建投入资金 And invest funds in rebuilding Gaza 在国内经济上 On the domestic economy 他打算就是 He intends to 建立一个 Build a 横跨加拿大东西向的油气管道

in Canada's power grid 以及小型的核裂变反应堆 And small-scale nuclear fission reactors 等等新型能源技术 Along with other new energy technologies 来解决加拿大的能源危机 To address Canada's energy crisis 根据最新的Mainstreet Research民调显示 According to the latest Mainstreet Research poll 弗兰克.贝利斯 Frank Baylis 他的民调支持率目前是4% Currently has a poll support rate of 4% 好 接下来这位 Alright, next up 民调排名第四 Ranked fourth in the polls 她的名字叫做卢比.达拉 Her name is Ruby Dhalla 你看这个照片 Look at this photo 这是一位女士 She's a woman 她是出生于1974年的2月18日 She was born on February 18, 1974 她是一位印度裔的加拿大女商人 She's an Indian-origin Canadian businesswoman 以及前国会议员 And former

year at McMaster University 后来去温尼伯大学继续学习 She continued her studies at the University of Winnipeg 后来在1995年 Later, in 1995 获得了生物化学理学学士学位 She earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biochemistry 辅修政治学 With a minor in Political Science 后来在1995年搬到多伦多 Then in 1995, she moved to Toronto 不知道因为什么原因 For some unknown reason 可能是因为兴趣吧 Maybe out of interest 又学了一个脊椎按摩专业 She studied chiropractic care 拿到了一个脊椎按摩医师资格 And obtained a chiropractic qualification 这英文就是chiropractic That's “chiropractic” in English 然后她就在大多地区 Then in the Greater Toronto Area 开了一家医疗保健连锁店 She opened a healthcare chain 后来 Later on 她还从事演艺实业 She also got involved in the entertainment industry 去印度宝莱坞客串 Making cameo appearances in Bollywood 拍过电影 She acted in films 而且她在1993年 And in 1993 一个本地的 In a local 印度加拿大小姐的选美比赛中 Indo-Canadian beauty pageant 还拿过第二名 She won second place 因此说你看她这照片 So if you look at her photo 她也是咱们今天这位五位候选人中 She's also the most attractive among the five candidates today 颜值最高的 In terms of looks 然后从2004年开始 Then starting in 2004 就是从2004年到2011年这七年之间 Between 2004 and 2011, over those seven years 她就进入了政坛 She entered politics 代表自由党 Representing the Liberal Party 当选那个Brampton下面 She was elected in Brampton 这个Springdale选区的国会议员 As the Member of Parliament for the Springdale riding 不过那个时候 But at that time 当时是保守党 It was the Conservative Party 哈珀政府在台上 With the Harper government in power 他们自由党在国会内的身份 The Liberals' status in Parliament 就是官方反对党 Was the official opposition 这位卢比.达拉 This Ruby Dhalla 她从政期间的风格 Her style during her political career 就是演讲能力比较强 Was strong oratory skills 加上人长得漂亮 Plus, she's good-looking 外在形象比较好 With a great public image 也是当时自由党内的红人 She was a star in the Liberal Party back then 但是你知道了 But you know 人红是非多 Fame brings controversy 再加上她比较高调外向 Plus, she's quite high-profile and outgoing 又能说 又不差钱 Eloquent and not short on money 又曾经跟娱乐圈有染 And with past ties to the entertainment world 因此说她从政期间也是争议不断 So her political career was full of controversies 但是具体细节 But as for the specific details 时间关系咱们就不说了 Due to time constraints, we won't go into them 后来2011年国会再次选举的时候 Later, during the 2011 parliamentary election 她就败给了她们选区保守党那个议员 She lost to the Conservative MP in her riding 从此退出政坛 And then exited politics 当然她也不是销声匿迹了 Of course, she didn't completely disappear 后来 Later on 她又在2014年的时候曾经考虑过复出 In 2014, she considered a comeback 想竞选2015年联邦大选 To run in the 2015 federal election 作为自由党的候选人 As a Liberal candidate 去跟特鲁多竞争 To compete with Trudeau 后来 But later 因为各种看不见的党内力量的干预 Due to various unseen internal party pressures 她就放弃了这个打算 She abandoned that plan 一直到10年之后 Until ten years later 特鲁多宣布辞职 When Trudeau announced his resignation 卢比.达拉 Ruby Dhalla 这位昔日的自由党美女明星 This former Liberal Party beauty star 在2025年的1月24日 On January 24, 2025 宣布参与自由党党魁竞选 Announced her candidacy for Liberal Party leader 她的竞选口号是从现在开始 Her campaign slogan is “Starting now 加拿大重新归来 Canada's comeback begins” Canada's comeback starts now 这位卢比.达拉女士的执政理念 This Ruby Dhalla's governing philosophy 我也总结了一下 I've summed it up too 大致有这么几条 It has a few main points 首先是针对特朗普的关税政策 First, regarding Trump's tariff policies 她的意思就是 Her stance is 不要征收反向报复性关税 Not to impose retaliatory tariffs 而是要跟特朗普谈判 But to negotiate with Trump 她这条我个人是比较赞成的 I personally quite agree with this one 另外在非法移民事务上 Also, on illegal immigration 她主张强力驱逐非法移民 She advocates for forcibly deporting illegal immigrants 毒品政策 On drug policy 她打算回归保守 She plans to take a conservative approach 对持有那些容易导致身体成瘾 For possessing drugs that easily lead to addiction 甚至死亡的硬性药物 Or even death, like hard drugs 比方说什么可卡因 Like cocaine 海洛因 Heroin 什么芬太尼之类的 Or fentanyl, things like that 一旦发现你持有 If you're found possessing them 一概判处终身监禁 It's life imprisonment across the board 另外在政府效率这块 Also, on government efficiency 她打算设立一个经济沙皇 She plans to appoint an economic czar 用来识别政府内部的浪费和超支 To identify waste and overspending within the government 同时也设立一个医保沙皇 And also establish a healthcare czar 就是在医疗保健系统上面进行审查 To audit the healthcare system 但是这个卢比.达拉女士她有一个硬伤 But this Ruby Dhalla has a major flaw 就是她的法语不流利 Her French isn't fluent 因此她还提议 So she's also proposed 设立一个来自魁北克的副总理 Appointing a deputy prime minister from Quebec 帮助她处理魁北克事务等等等等 To help her handle Quebec affairs, and so on 根据2月13日最新民调显示 According to the latest poll on February 13 卢比.达拉她现在的支持率是14% Ruby Dhalla's current support rate is 14% 好 接下来咱们说这个民调排第三的 Alright, next let's talk about the one ranked third in the polls 她的名字叫做卡琳娜.古尔德 Her name is Karina Gould 这位 This one 你看照片好像挺显老的 Looking at her photo, she seems a bit older 但是她是一位非常年轻的政治新星 But she's a very young rising political star 她出生在安省的Burlington She was born in Burlington, Ontario 也就是我们Oakville旁边那个 That's the city next to Oakville 这个城市 This city 她的出生日期是1987年的6月28日 Her birthdate is June 28, 1987 你看今年还不到40岁 See, she's not even 40 this year 这位古尔德女士 This Ms. Gould 也是这次自由党党魁竞选中 Is also in this Liberal Party leadership race 最年轻的候选人 The youngest candidate 也是5个候选人中 And among the five candidates 唯一一个在竞选前 The only one who, before the race 仍然担任内阁职务的候选人 Was still serving in a cabinet position 她的职务 Her position 是下议院的政府领袖 Was Leader of the Government in the House of Commons 但是政策规定竞选前 你必须得辞职 But policy requires you to resign before running 于是她就在1月24日 辞去所有职务 So on January 24, she resigned from all her positions 专心参与竞选 To focus on the campaign 把她身上这个下议院领袖的位置 Handing over her role as House Leader 交给了史蒂文.麦金农 To Steven MacKinnon 接下来 Next 咱们说一下古尔德女士的家庭背景 Let's talk about Ms. Gould's family background 她家的背景比较加拿大化 Her family background is quite Canadian 就是显示了一个非常丰富的 It reflects a very rich 文化和历史的融合 Blend of culture and history 你看她的爷爷奶奶 Take her grandparents, for example 是大屠杀中幸存下来的捷克犹太人 They were Czech Jews who survived the Holocaust 然后她的犹太裔的父亲 Then her Jewish father 是出生在加拿大 Was born in Canada 后来当她父亲出国旅行 Later, when her father traveled abroad 住在以色列的基布兹 Living in a kibbutz in Israel 那个城市的时候 In that city 遇到了她的母亲 He met her mother 就是一位来自德国的女性 A woman from Germany 两个人结合生下的她 And together they had her 所以说古尔德她是半个犹太人 So Gould is half-Jewish 她的犹太血统来自富硒 Her Jewish heritage comes from her father's side 然后她小时候就是在Burlington长大 Then she grew up in Burlington 16岁的时候 At the age of 16 就是高中时期 During high school 她就参加了加拿大青年论坛 She participated in the Forum for Young Canadians 对政治产生了浓厚的兴趣 Developing a strong interest in politics 等高中毕业之后 After graduating high school 她就去墨西哥的一家孤儿院 She went to an orphanage in Mexico 做了一年的志愿者 Volunteering for a year 在那里 There 她不仅学会了西班牙语 She not only learned Spanish 还遇到了她未来的丈夫 But also met her future husband 后来在2006年 Later, in 2006 她回到加拿大 She returned to Canada 就读于麦吉尔大学 And attended McGill University 获得了政治学学位 Earning a degree in Political Science 在2010年 她又去美国华盛顿特区 In 2010, she went to Washington, D.C. 在美洲国家组织找到了一份工作 Finding a job at the Organization of American States 然后又去了英国牛津大学 Then she went to the University of Oxford in the UK 读了一个国际关系硕士学位 Earning a Master's degree in International Relations 等硕士毕业之后 After completing her Master's 她感觉在外面闯荡累了 She felt tired of roaming abroad 就决定搬回家乡 安省的Burlington So she decided to move back to her hometown, Burlington, Ontario 在多伦多的一家墨西哥贸易委员会 Finding a job at the Mexican Trade Commission in Toronto 找到了一份投资专家的工作 As an investment specialist 然后工作不到一年 Then, less than a year into the job 就是2015年 In 2015 她28岁的时候 At the age of 28 她就开始进入政坛 She entered politics 在2015年加拿大联邦选举中 In the 2015 Canadian federal election 当选Burlington选区的国会议员 She was elected as the Member of Parliament for Burlington 并且在2015年的12月份 And in December 2015 被任命为 She was appointed as 国际发展部和法语事务部的政务次长 Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of International Development and La Francophonie 到2017年的1月份 By January 2017 她又被任命为民主机构部部长 She was appointed Minister of Democratic Institutions 这也使得她成为加拿大历史上 Making her the youngest female cabinet minister in Canadian history 最年轻的女性内阁部长 At that time 当时她年仅29岁 She was just 29 years old 后来到了2019年的11月份 Later, in November 2019 她又被特鲁多任命为国际发展部部长 She was appointed by Trudeau as Minister of International Development 2021年10月份 In October 2021 又被任命为家庭 She was appointed Minister of Families 儿童和社会发展部部长 Children and Social Development 最后 她是在2023年的7月份 Finally, in July 2023 被任命为下议院的政府领袖 She was appointed Leader of the Government in the House of Commons 她这个领袖一直当到2025年的1月24日 She held that role until January 24, 2025 她为了参加自由党党魁选举 When she resigned to run for Liberal Party leadership 而辞职为止 Up until her resignation 因此说你看这位古尔德女士 So you see, this Ms. Gould 她给人的印象就是一个是学霸 Gives the impression of being a top student 一个是政坛新星 And a rising political star 她非常受特鲁多总理的器重 She was highly valued by Prime Minister Trudeau 而且她的政务能力是相当的强 And her administrative skills are quite impressive 没有什么太多的丑闻和不当行为 She has few scandals or missteps 家庭也比较稳定 Her family life is also fairly stable 有一儿一女 She has one son and one daughter 大儿子今年7岁 Her eldest son is 7 years old this year 小女儿一岁多一点 Her younger daughter is just over a year old 她的大儿子是2018年生的 Her eldest son was born in 2018 当时她还担任内阁的部长 While she was still a cabinet minister 于是这就使得她成为加拿大历史上 This made her the first in Canadian history 第一位 在任期间生孩子 To give birth while in office 在任期间休产假的内阁部长 And take maternity leave as a cabinet minister 所以说 So 也创造了好几个加拿大之最 She's set several Canadian firsts 这位古尔德女士 This Ms. Gould 她的竞选口号 Her campaign slogan 截止目前为止 As of now 她还没有正式提出 She hasn't officially put one forward 然而虽然没有官方的口号 However, though there's no official slogan 但是咱们根据她竞选信息中 Based on her campaign materials 一个反复出现的主题 A recurring theme 就可以被解释为一个非正式的slogan Can be interpreted as an unofficial slogan 口号那就是Generation of leadership That slogan being “Generation of Leadership” 新一代的领导力 A new generation of leadership 说白了 To put it simply 就是把自己定位为新一代的领导人 She's positioning herself as a leader of the new generation 实际上她就是主打一个年龄优势 In essence, she's playing up her age advantage 目前古尔德女士所宣扬的执政理念 The governing philosophy Ms. Gould is promoting now 我总结了一下 I've summed it up 大致有这么几条 It includes these main points 关于碳税这块 On the carbon tax 她是取消增加碳税的计划 She plans to cancel increases to the carbon tax 但是她没有提出正式的取消碳税 But she hasn't proposed fully abolishing it 而是在现在的碳税基础上加以完善 Instead, refining the current carbon tax 让它更加合理 To make it more reasonable 她打算取而代之的 What she plans to replace it with 是制定一个给污染定价这么一个计划 Is a plan to price pollution 换句话说 就是谁排污谁交钱 In other words, polluters pay 另外一些方面 In other areas 她还主张 She also advocates 部分减税 Partial tax cuts 就是反对提高资本利得税 Opposing increases to the

politics 顺利当选多伦多中心选区的国会议员 Successfully elected as the Member of Parliament for Toronto Centre 2015年11月 In November 2015 刚上台的特鲁多总理 The newly elected Prime Minister Trudeau 在他的第一届内阁中 In his first

after the 2019 federal election 她就是在19年的11月份 In November 2019 被任命为副总理兼政府兼事务部部长 She was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs 就巩固了 This solidified 她作为特鲁多左膀右臂的这个地位 Her position as Trudeau's right-hand person 于是她的影响力进一步扩大 Thus, her influence expanded further 后来到了2020年的8月份 Later, in August 2020 她又被任命为财政部长 She was appointed Minister of Finance 这也是加拿大历史上 This was also the first time in Canadian history 第一次由女性担任的财政部长 A woman served as Finance Minister 也创建了一个加拿大之最 Setting another Canadian first 而且她在这个位置上带领着加拿大 And in this role, she led Canada 度过了疫情期间前所未有的经济挑战 Through unprecedented economic challenges during the pandemic 可以说 她能力也是很强的 It can be said her abilities are very strong 因此她在自由党内部有一个绰号 So within the Liberal Party, she has a nickname 叫做“万能部长” Called the “All-Purpose Minister” 结果谁也没想到 But no one expected 四年之后 Four years later 戏剧性的一幕到来了 A dramatic turn of events would unfold 2024年的12月16日 On December 16, 2024 方慧兰出人意料地 Chrystia Freeland unexpectedly 从特鲁多的内阁中宣布辞职 Announced her resignation from Trudeau's cabinet 暴露了自由党内部的深深的裂痕 Exposing deep rifts within the Liberal Party 她辞职的理由 Her reason for resigning 就是跟特鲁多在税收减免 Was major disagreements with Trudeau over tax cuts 以及政策制定方面 And policy-making 存在着巨大的分歧 There were huge differences 在面对着 In the face of 特朗普对加拿大的关税威胁面前 Trump's tariff threats against Canada 特鲁多却主张通过减免税收 Trudeau insisted on stimulating the economy through tax cuts 发钱给老百姓以刺激经济 And handouts to the public 而方慧兰 While Chrystia Freeland 则主张节俭度日 Advocated for frugality 加强财政储备 Strengthening fiscal reserves 以应对潜在的关税战 To prepare for a potential tariff war 然后两个人就闹掰了 Then the two fell out 特鲁多先是通知方慧兰 Trudeau first informed Chrystia Freeland 不再希望她担任财政部长 That he no longer wanted her as Finance Minister 并且 And 打算为她提供一个内阁中其他的职位 Planned to offer her another position in the cabinet 说白了就是给她降了个级 In short, it was a demotion 那以方慧兰的脾气 能受得了这个吗 With Chrystia Freeland's temperament, could she tolerate that? 直接高调宣布辞职 She directly and publicly announced her resignation 把这个特鲁多给晾在那了 Leaving Trudeau hanging 使得特鲁多在党内的声望是越来越低 Causing Trudeau's prestige within the party to drop further 越来越被孤立 Becoming increasingly isolated 然后这个方慧兰的辞职 And Chrystia Freeland's resignation 也最终成为了 Ultimately became 压垮骆驼的最后一根稻草 The final straw that broke the camel's back 导致了特鲁多宣布 Leading Trudeau to announce 辞去自由党领袖的职务 His resignation as Liberal Party leader 接下来这个方慧兰 Next, this Chrystia Freeland 就在1月17日宣布 Announced on January 17 参加下届自由党党魁竞选 Her candidacy for the next Liberal Party leadership race 并且于1月22日 And on January 22 获得了自由党党部的批准 Received approval

是史密斯堡的一位高中校长 And was a high school principal in Fort Smith 因此说 So 他的家庭观念上是比较重视教育的 His family placed a strong emphasis on education 但是他妈妈没有工作 But his mother didn't work 就是一个家庭主妇 She was a homemaker 后来在马克.卡尼6岁的时候 Later, when Mark Carney was 6 他们全家搬到了 The whole family moved to 阿尔伯塔省的埃德蒙顿 Edmonton, Alberta 西边的一个社区 A community on the west side 他们家搬家的目的 The purpose of the move 是为了寻求更好的教育和职业机会 Was to

Completely different from his grandfather's generation 但是他心中对移民的奋斗历史 But in his heart, he never forgot the struggles of immigrants 是时刻不忘 Always keeping it in mind 于是 So 你就看他在自己英格兰银行的办公室 You can see

Conservative Party 这个哈珀 This Harper 当时看这个马克.卡尼这么优秀 Seeing how outstanding Mark Carney was 就问他 你是否愿意加入保守党政府 Asked him if he'd be willing to join the Conservative government 担任财政部长 As Finance Minister 卡尼当时拒绝了 Carney declined at the time 他后来在接受CBC采访的时候 Later, in an interview with CBC 给出的理由就是 He gave the reason that 他就当时觉得 He felt at the time 从央行行长直接进入选举政治 Going directly from a central bank governor

是12月16日 On December 16 宣布辞去财政部部长的职务 Announced her resignation as Finance Minister 而特鲁多是在三天之前的13日 While Trudeau, three days earlier on the 13th 就曾经私下里告诉方慧兰 Had privately told Chrystia Freeland 他想让卡尼 That he wanted Carney 取代方慧兰的财政部长职位 To replace her as Finance Minister 让方慧兰专心去处理 And have Chrystia Freeland focus on handling 这个美加关税谈判的事 The Canada-U.S. tariff negotiations 当然据分析 Of course, according to analysis 特鲁多当时可能没有想太多 Trudeau might not have thought too much about it at the time 并非是针对方慧兰 It wasn't necessarily aimed at Chrystia Freeland 但是在这个 But at this 双方政策有产生分歧的节骨眼上提这事 Critical juncture where their policies diverged 这方慧兰就比较敏感了 Chrystia Freeland became quite sensitive about it 就觉得自己不再受特鲁多的信任 Feeling she was no longer trusted by Trudeau 于是就愤而辞职 So she resigned in anger 等她辞职之后 After her resignation 这个特鲁多就跟马克.卡尼说 Trudeau said to Mark Carney 你可不可以担任下一任财政部长 “Can you serve as the next Finance Minister?” 就等卡尼一句话了 It was up to Carney's response 然后再看这个马克.卡尼 Then looking at Mark Carney 一反常态 Uncharacteristically 他没有立刻接受财政部长的职位 He didn't immediately accept the Finance Minister position 而是犹豫不决 Instead, he hesitated 举棋不定 Uncertain 他在想什么 What was he thinking? 他其实一方面 On one hand 他是不想在政治漩涡中趟这个浑水 He didn't want to wade into this political mess 成为一个特鲁多的棋子 Become a pawn for Trudeau 得罪方慧兰 And offend Chrystia Freeland 以及方慧兰背后 Along with the many 众多的自由党高层的支持者 Liberal Party senior supporters backing Chrystia Freeland 那就不好了 That wouldn't be good 另外 他也知道 On the other hand, he knew 现在加拿大特鲁多政府 The current Trudeau government in Canada 欠了一屁股外债 Was saddled with massive foreign debt 赤字是居高不下 With a persistently high deficit 你现在接盘的话 If he took over now 那麻烦大了去了 It'd be a huge mess 还有一条就是 And another point was 就算你当了这个财政部长 Even if he became Finance Minister 你也只能干几个月 He'd only serve for a few months 然后自由党就得下台 Then the Liberal Party would lose power 然后你又没工作了 And he'd be out of a job again 你何苦来 Why bother? 于是他就非常精明 So he was very shrewd 果断的拒绝了特鲁多的邀请 And decisively declined Trudeau's offer 事实证明 Facts proved 他这一步棋走的非常的对 This move was absolutely the right one 一旦他接受了特鲁多的邀请 Had he accepted Trudeau's invitation 担任下一任财政部长 To serve as the next Finance Minister 那么他的身份就不再是独立行为者 His identity would no longer be that of an independent actor 而是特鲁多的代理人 But rather Trudeau's proxy 而反过来 Conversely 如果他不接受这个财长职务的话 If he didn't take the Finance Minister role 那就退一步海阔天空 It'd be a step back opening up a world of possibilities 不仅跟方慧兰是化干戈为玉帛 Not only making peace with Chrystia Freeland 同时也能够以一个局外人的身份 But also allowing him to maintain an outsider's status 跟当初土豆胡乱执政 Distancing himself from Trudeau's chaotic governance 带来的负资产和天价的财政赤字 And the negative assets and sky-high fiscal deficits it caused 划清界限 Drawing a clear line 然后再顺理成章地轻装上阵 Then naturally stepping into the ring unburdened 参加下一届自由党党魁竞选 To run in the next Liberal Party leadership race 可以说马克.卡尼这个人的脑子 It can be said that Mark Carney's mind 他脑子好使 Is sharp 下了一部非常精明的好棋 He played a very smart move 后来你看这个事情的发展 And later, the development of events 也证明了他的做法是对的 Proved his approach was correct 你看他是1月16日宣布参选 He announced his candidacy on January 16 在1月22日他得到了自由党党部的批准 On January 22, he received approval from the Liberal Party 然后他的选情就是一路走高 Then his campaign momentum kept rising 支持者是越来越多 Gaining more and more supporters 根据2月13日Mainstreet民调显示 According to the February 13 Mainstreet poll 马克.卡尼的支持率 目前高达42% Mark Carney's support rate is currently as high as 42% 而他在1月13日之前 And before January 13 他的支持率还低于方慧兰 His support rate was lower than Chrystia Freeland's 但是在接下来的一个月之内 But within the next month 他是低开高走 He started low and soared high 渐入佳境 Gradually hitting his stride 无论是在党内的支持率 Whether in party support 还是在全国的支持率 Or national support 他都已经超过了方慧兰 He surpassed Chrystia Freeland 10个百分点以上了 By more than 10 percentage points 而之前那些放弃参选的自由党大佬们 And those Liberal heavyweights who opted not to run 他们的第一选择也都是马克.卡尼尔 Their top choice was also Mark Carney 不是方慧兰 Not Chrystia Freeland 那看到这 So seeing this 很多人都会问一个问题 Many people would ask a question 这马克.卡尼 This Mark Carney 你一个新人 You, a newcomer 你凭什么会反超自由党内的资深大佬 How could you overtake a seasoned Liberal Party veteran 方慧兰 Like Chrystia Freeland? 这个说白了很简单 To put it simply, it's straightforward 首先马克.卡尼 First, Mark Carney 他是一个经济专家和技术官僚的身份 Comes as an economic expert and technocrat 而且从未担任过任何自由党内的公职 And has never held any public office within the Liberal Party 他身上天然就没有政客的原罪 He naturally carries none of the original sins of a politician 以一个清新脱俗的这个局外人的形象 Appearing before Canadians with a fresh, untainted outsider image 出现在加拿大人民眼前 In the eyes of the Canadian public 自然就吸引了那些 Naturally attracting those 讨厌现代土豆政府的新老选民们 New and old voters who dislike the current Trudeau government 尤其是在特朗普的关税打压面前 Especially in the face of Trump's tariff pressures 让一个严谨的经济学家出面 Putting forward a rigorous economist 跟一个满嘴跑火车的 To negotiate with a fast-talking 油头滑脑的商人来谈判的话 Slick businessman 前景可期 Holds promising prospects 而反过来看方慧兰 On the other hand, looking at Chrystia Freeland 虽说他有非常丰富的政治经验 Though she has very rich political experience 而且他跟特朗普也是交手多次 And has faced off with Trump multiple times 不过方慧兰的问题就是 But Chrystia Freeland's problem is 她跟特鲁多政府这个联系过于紧密 She's too closely tied to the Trudeau government 有很多选民就对她产生了审美疲劳 Many voters have grown tired of her 而且会不自觉的把土豆政府在经济 And unconsciously attribute the economic mess of the Trudeau government 上面搞出来的超高的财政赤字 With its sky-high fiscal deficits 责任归咎于她 To her 而且 And 她在2024年10月份的那个突然辞职 Her sudden resignation in October 2024 就是可以说是关键时刻 Can be said to have been at a critical moment 给老板背刺一刀 A stab in the back to her boss 引发了党内的分裂 Triggering a split within the party 就使得方慧兰在党内支持率 Which damaged Chrystia Freeland's support within the party 也受到了损害 Taking a hit 目前 Currently 她在党内的负面评价要比卡尼要高10% Her negative perception within the party is 10% higher than Carney's 就是这个原因 That's the reason 截止到现在 As of now 卡尼获得了16位的内阁部长 Carney has gained the support of 16 cabinet ministers 以及大量的国会议员的支持 And a large number of MPs 而方慧兰 While Chrystia Freeland 仅仅获得了5位内阁部长的支持 Has only secured the support of 5 cabinet ministers 而且根据Leger民调调查显示 And according to a Leger poll 马克.卡尼 Mark Carney 在自由党成员中的支持率是57% Has a 57% support rate among Liberal Party members 而方慧兰只有17% While Chrystia Freeland has only 17% 你看卡尼领先了方慧兰40% See, Carney leads Chrystia Freeland by 40% 这说明什么呀 What does this show? 这说明 It shows 自由党党内精英是普遍倾向于卡尼 The Liberal Party's elite generally favor Carney 另外卡尼在国际大公司和金融领域 Also, Carney's commanding presence in international corporations and finance 呼风唤雨的 His ability to wield influence 超强简历 And stellar resume 就使得他在这个筹款能力上 Have made him far superior in fundraising 也遥遥领先 Outpacing others by a wide margin 截止现在他已经筹到了190万加币了 As of now, he's raised $1.9 million CAD 而方慧兰只筹到了可怜的22.7万加币 While Chrystia Freeland has only raised a meager $227,000 CAD 这也间接反映了 This indirectly reflects 卡尼比方慧兰有更强的组织能力 That Carney has stronger organizational skills than Chrystia Freeland 另外还有一个就是在执政理念方面 Another factor is their governing philosophies 虽说方慧兰的执政理念 Though Chrystia Freeland's governing philosophy 虽说比土豆来说 Compared to Trudeau 是往右边靠了一些 Leans a bit to the right 比方说减税 For example, tax cuts 控制食品利润 Controlling food profits 但是 But 她主张对美国进行对等的关税报复 She advocates for retaliatory tariffs against the U.S. 以及在某些政策上 And on certain policies 她还是延续着特鲁多的路线 She still follows Trudeau's path 因此方慧兰作为特鲁多的局内人 So as Trudeau's insider, Chrystia Freeland 她没法扭转选民对自由党的负面看法 Can't reverse voters' negative views of the Liberal Party 而卡尼 While Carney 她的执政理念就比方慧兰务实的很多 Has a much more pragmatic governing philosophy than Chrystia Freeland 还甚至可以说是卡尼 It could even be said that Carney 他瞄准的是中间派 Is targeting centrists 和潜在的保守党的选民 And potential Conservative voters 有民调显示 Polls show 在如果是他领导下的自由党 That if he led the Liberal Party 有可能会抹平 It could bridge 与保守党之间的政策差异 The policy gap with the Conservative Party 因此 So 卡尼自然已经受到老百姓的欢迎了 Carney has naturally gained popularity among the public 好 接下来 Alright, next 咱们就重磅推出 We'll grandly present 马克.卡尼先生的执政理念 Mr. Mark Carney's governing philosophy 先说他的竞选口号 Starting with his campaign slogan 他的竞选口号是让我们一起建设 His campaign slogan is “Let's build together” let's build together Let's build together 咱们下面就看一看 Let's take a look below 卡尼先生是怎么一个build together How Mr. Carney plans to “build together” 第一个就是大家最关心的 The first thing everyone cares about 就是碳税这块 Is the carbon tax 大家你看 You see 最近看电视 Recently on TV 这个保守党又推出一系列电视广告 The Conservative Party has rolled out a series of TV ads 说这个卡尼是支持碳税的 Saying Carney supports the carbon tax 那么卡尼到底支不支持碳税 So does Carney actually support the carbon tax? 的确 Indeed 一开始他确实是声明自己支持碳税的 Initially, he did state his support for the carbon tax 但是后来在汹汹的民意面前 But later, facing overwhelming public opinion 他已经声明要取消碳税 He declared he would abolish the carbon tax 但是取消碳税 But abolishing the carbon tax 并不代表着他在环保方面无所作为 Doesn't mean he'll do nothing on the environmental front 他是打算采取一种奖励机制 He plans to implement an incentive mechanism 对于那些绿色的环保企业 For green, environmentally friendly businesses 采取一个奖励计划 Introducing an incentive program 我觉得他这个方法 I think this approach 倒是两头都不得罪 Manages to avoid offending either side 然后他还打算引入“碳边境调整” Then he also plans to introduce a “carbon border adjustment” 什么意思 What does that mean? 就是惩罚那些高污染的外国进口产品 It means penalizing high-pollution foreign imported products 第三个政策就是国防方面 The third policy is on defense 他打算把GDP的2%用于北约国防开支 He plans to allocate 2% of GDP to NATO defense spending 但是他这个年限是到2030年年底 But his timeline extends to the end of 2030 这拖的非常长 Which is quite a long delay 这个特朗普肯定不满意 Trump definitely won't be happy about this 此外 Additionally 还有打算取消资本利得税 He plans to abolish the capital gains tax 并且被中产阶级减税 And provide tax cuts for the middle class 这块其实也是比较靠右 This is actually quite right-leaning 还有就是 Also 减少住房建筑项目 Reducing red tape in housing construction projects 和省际贸易的繁文缛节 And interprovincial trade bureaucracy 以降低制度性腐败的空间 To reduce opportunities for systemic corruption 你看 一方面降低建房成本 See, on one hand, it lowers housing costs 解决住房问题 Addressing the housing issue 这个估计是借鉴了保守党 This is likely borrowed from the Conservative Party 应对高房价的一个措施 As a measure to tackle high housing prices 另外一方面 On the other hand 降低国内贸易成本 Reducing domestic trade costs 他的口号就是 加拿大是一个经济体 His slogan is “Canada is one economy 而不是13个经济体 Not 13 economies” 所以说 一定要减少省际的贸易壁垒 So interprovincial trade barriers must be reduced 这样才可以促进内需 To boost domestic demand 解决加拿大的内部资源调配问题 And address Canada's internal resource allocation issues 另外 他还支持 Additionally, he supports 在加拿大建成一个东西向的石油管道的概念 The concept of building an east-west oil pipeline in Canada 以利于加拿大能源出口欧洲和亚洲 To facilitate Canada's energy exports to Europe and Asia 关于财政这块 On fiscal matters 他是打算维持现有的加拿大赤字 He plans to maintain Canada's current deficit 新的钱 New funds 就打算投资加拿大经济 Would be invested in the Canadian economy 同时平衡一个运营支出 While balancing operational spending 就是说 先做到收支平衡 Meaning, first achieving a balanced budget 再慢慢的消减赤字 Then gradually reducing the deficit 这个也是比较务实的 This is also quite pragmatic 接下来 Next 就好像没什么了 It seems there's not much else 这个很抱歉 Sorry about that 说了半天 After all this talk 你可能失望 You might be disappointed 前面咱们介绍 We built up 卡尼把这个气氛烘托的这么长时间 Carney with all this hype for so long 结果他的执政理念这么短 And his governing philosophy ends up this short 没错 That's right 这个也不奇怪 And it's not surprising 因为他是一个经济专家 Because he's an economic expert 他目前能给加拿大开出来的解药 The remedies he can currently offer Canada 也只是在能源政策和经济方面 Are mainly in energy policy and economics 而其他的 As for other areas 至于什么移民政策呀 Like immigration policy 福利政策呀 Welfare policy 对美关系呀 U.S. relations 政治改革呀 Political reform 什么教育制度 Education system 医疗保健 Healthcare 民族政策 National policy 多元文化等等 Multiculturalism, and so on 那些跟国家民生 Those closely tied to national livelihood 和老百姓的利益密切相关的 And the interests of the public 其他方面 Other aspects 他目前暂时 He hasn't yet 还没有机会表达自己的观点 Had the chance to express his views 所以说你看 So you see 马克.卡尼跟方慧兰的执政理念 Mark Carney's and Chrystia Freeland's governing philosophies 其实还是有些方面是类似的 Actually share some similarities 比方说在撤销资本利得税的上调 For example, in reversing the capital gains tax increase 还有减税等等 And tax cuts, among others 只不过他开出来的药方 But the remedies he prescribes 可能比方慧兰更加具有长远的眼光 Might have a more long-term vision than Chrystia Freeland's 而不是只看到短期的利益 Rather than just focusing on short-term gains 还有在对美国的关税谈判中 Also, in tariff negotiations with the U.S. 他可能不如方慧兰那么具有攻击性 He might not be as aggressive as Chrystia Freeland 就是说他比较务实 Meaning he's more pragmatic 而不是像方慧兰那样 Unlike Chrystia Freeland 身上带有这么一股民粹主义的味道 Who carries a strong populist vibe 另外在经济调节方面 Also, in economic regulation 卡尼更倾向于市场调节 Carney leans more toward market regulation 而方慧兰 While Chrystia Freeland 则更加注重于政府的干预 Places more emphasis on government intervention 在碳税政策上面 On the carbon tax policy 他们两个人其实都是要取消碳税 Both of them actually want to abolish the carbon tax 但是方法不太一样 But their approaches differ 方慧兰是打算具体情况具体分析 Chrystia Freeland plans to tailor it case by case 环保政策 Environmental policies 需要根据各省的实际情况量身定制 Need to be customized based on each province's specific situation 而卡尼则主张用奖励计划 While Carney advocates for incentive programs 用市场调节的大手 Using the big hand of market regulation 来带动环保的自觉性 To drive environmental awareness 所以说 总体来说 So overall 感觉卡尼的政策 It feels like Carney's policies 其实不太像一个传统的自由党 Aren't quite like those of a traditional Liberal Party 而是更多的依赖市场调节 But rely more on market regulation 更接近保守党的政策 Closer to Conservative Party policies 估计听到这 Hearing this 我也相信 I also believe 屏幕前有很多保守党的粉丝们 There are many Conservative Party fans in front of the screen 你们大概也想听一听 You probably want to hear 马克.卡尼和博励治 About Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre 这二位的执政理念 The governing philosophies of these two 他们俩之间有什么区别 And what differences there are between them 时间关系 Due to time constraints 我就简单说一下 I'll keep it brief 博励治所在的保守党 Poilievre's Conservative Party 他宣扬的核心是小政府的民粹主义 Promotes a core of small-government populism 减免税收 Tax cuts 完全取消贪税 Completely abolishing the carbon tax 减少繁文缛节 Reducing red tape 缩减联邦支出 Cutting federal spending 以增强个人和企业的能力 To empower individuals and businesses 说白了就是说呀 In simple terms 卡尼他是在精简改革 现有的政府管理 Carney is streamlining and reforming the existing government structure 而不是反政府 Not anti-government 而博励治则倾向于反政府的立场 While Poilievre leans toward an anti-government stance 目的是拆掉现在这个政府体制 Aiming to dismantle the current government system 成立一个新型的完全让位于自由经济 And establish a new one fully yielding to free-market economics 为自由经济保驾护航的小政府 A small government safeguarding free-market principles 双方的差别 The difference between them 在环保政策上面就表现的很明显 Is particularly evident in environmental policy 卡尼是拿出一个绿色的胡萝卜 Carney offers a green carrot 来鼓励大家环保 To encourage environmentalism 把这个气候纳入自己的 Incorporating climate into his 治理范围 Governance scope 而博励治 While Poilievre 实际上就是放弃环保 Effectively abandons environmental concerns 把环保搁置一旁 Putting environmentalism aside 至于至于气候问题怎么办 As for what to do about climate issues 留给市场去解决 Leave it to the market to solve 政府不应该干预 The government shouldn't intervene 另外 Also 他们两个人的领导风格也不太一样 Their leadership styles differ too 马克.卡尼 Mark Carney 是一个温文儒雅的学者形象 Has the image of a refined, scholarly figure 专业知识很强 With strong expertise 而且身上带有明显的精英主义特质 And clear elitist traits 而博励治 While Pierre Poilievre 则完全给人一种小混混挑战精英的 Completely gives off a vibe of a scrappy underdog challenging the elite 这么一个反精英的代表 A representative of anti-elitism 他不仅好斗 He's not only combative 而且擅长演讲 But also a skilled speaker 咱们用一个形象的比喻 Let's use a vivid metaphor 卡尼是微笑着用稳定的手扶正桥梁 Carney is smiling while steadily fixing the bridge 并且加以修缮 And repairing it 而博励治 While Poilievre 则拿出大锤砸烂这个桥梁 Takes a sledgehammer to smash the bridge 在对抗中茁壮成长 Thriving in confrontation 如果在辩论环节 If in a debate setting 博励治遇到了卡尼 Poilievre faced Carney 那么很可能就会发生这样的情况 It's very likely this would happen 主持人问10条政策 The host asks about 10 policies 卡尼 Carney 则会耐心细致的给出10个解决方案 Would patiently and meticulously provide 10 solutions 而博励治 While Poilievre 一边吃着苹果 Eating an apple 一边轻蔑的甩出7个字 Would scornfully toss out seven words 交给市场 我不管 “Leave it to the market, I don't care” 就这意思 That's the gist 因此说 So 接下来会发生什么 What happens next 虽说现在在自由党党魁的民意调查中 Although in the current Liberal Party leadership polls 马克.卡尼保持着明显的优势 Mark Carney maintains a clear lead 但是在2025年3月9日 But before March 9, 2025 加拿大自由党选举投票开始之前 When the Canadian Liberal Party election voting begins 这个马克.卡尼 This Mark Carney 还有两场辩论大关要通过 Still has two major debate hurdles to clear 第一场辩论 The first debate 是2025年的2月24日星期一 Is on Monday, February 24, 2025 开始的法语辩论 A French-language debate 第二场是第二天2月25日星期二 The second is the next day, Tuesday, February 25 进行的英语辩论 An English-language debate 届时五位候选人将全数出场 All five candidates will participate 但是大家关注的焦点 But the focus of attention 还是方慧兰与马克.卡尼 Will be on Chrystia Freeland and Mark Carney 这二位重量级大咖的较量 The showdown between these two heavyweights 大家都会比较好奇 Everyone will be curious 卡尼在辩论现场的表现 About Carney's performance at the debate 演讲能力 His speaking skills 以及非常重要的这个法语能力 And, crucially, his French language ability 到底行不行 Whether it's up to par 到底能不能经受住方慧兰的锤炼 Whether he can withstand Chrystia Freeland's scrutiny 你可别忘了这方慧兰的语言能力 Don't forget Chrystia Freeland's language skills 他是精通英语法语俄语乌克兰语 She's fluent in English, French, Russian, Ukrainian 还有意大利语五国语言 And Italian—five languages 而这个马克.卡尼这个法语到底灵不灵 While whether Mark Carney's French is fluent 目前没有得到实战检验 Hasn't yet been tested in action 我觉得应该不会太出色 I don't think it'll be outstanding 再加上这二位 Plus, these two 一个是搞技术的 One's a technocrat 一个是搞政治的 One's a politician 那辩论起来 So in a debate 很多人就会担心 Many will worry 这个卡尼 That Carney 你会不会被方慧兰摁在地上摩擦呀 Might get trounced by Chrystia Freeland 为他捏一把汗 Sweating for him 万一要是在辩论环节马失前提 If he stumbles in the debate 那么是否接下来 Would that then 会进一步影响到卡尼的支持率 Further affect Carney's support rate? 这个我说了也不算 That's not for me to say 不过我估计 But I reckon 应该也不会有什么太大意外 There probably won't be any major surprises 毕竟卡尼也是一个见过大场面的人 After all, Carney's someone who's seen big stages 等到3月9日投票结果出炉 When the voting results come out on March 9 我乐观估计 I'm optimistic that 这个马克.卡尼 This Mark Carney 将会取得自由党党魁的选举胜利 Will win the Liberal Party leadership election 接替特鲁多成为加拿大下一届总理 Succeeding Trudeau as Canada's next Prime Minister 当然 Of course 他只不过是一个短暂的过渡性总理 He'd only be a short-term transitional Prime Minister 至于这个过渡期到底能够持续多久 As for how long this transition period will last 那就要等到3月底了 That'll depend on late March 看一看自由党 To see if the Liberal Party 能不能挺过 Can survive 议会重开之后的不卸任投票 The no-confidence vote after Parliament reopens 要是能挺过去 If they can get through it 看你就可以一直干到10月份 He could stay in office until October 要是挺不过去的话 If they can't 他就需要立马下台 He'd have to step down immediately 然后 Then 接受来自保守党博励治的终极考验 Face the ultimate test from the Conservative Party's Pierre Poilievre 其实他们两个人的对决 Actually, a showdown between the two 还是挺让人期待的 Is pretty exciting to look forward to 好 今天时间也到了 Alright, that's all for today 如果您喜欢我的视频 If you enjoyed my video 欢迎您打赏点赞订阅 Feel free to tip, like, and subscribe 或者是点击屏幕下方的二维码
