the global economy has a peculiar habit of what economists diplomatically call periodic Corrections you might know them better as those moments when everyone suddenly remembers markets can go down as well as up 2008 the housing market discovers the law of gravity 2020 the global economy learns it's not actually cloud-based 2023 Silicon Valley Bank proves that even the most Innovative disruption still follows the base Bic rules of banking behind each of these Corrections stands John Maynard KES The Economist who dared to suggest that perhaps markets aren't as self-regulating as we'd like to believe in the next couple of minutes we'll explore how economies actually function why free markets sometimes freeze and what can be done about it whether you're an investor trying to understand Market Cycles a student preparing for exams or someone wondering why economic theory suddenly feels relevant this is where Theory meets reality let's start with the world before canes when markets were supposed to fix themselves before can's economic theory was built on an elegantly simple idea markets naturally find balance like a perfectly tuned machine Supply meets demand prices adjust and every problem fixes itself Adam Smith's invisible hand would guide the economy to Optimal outcomes without any outside interference this wasn't just Theory it seemed to work the Industrial Revolution transformed economies markets expanded and living standards Rose the Invisible Hand was conducting a masterpiece then came 1929 the Great Depression wasn't just a downturn it was a mathematical impossibility according to classical economics with unemployment reaching 25% and production Falling by a third the Invisible Hand had apparently developed a severe Tremor classical economists kept insisting the market would self-correct which is rather like saying a car without brakes will eventually stop technically true but the destination might be problematic what kan's realized watching this economic freef fall was that the economy isn't a self-regulating machine it's more like a complex network of human decisions each influencing the other and human decisions as we're about to see don't always follow the rational path economists expect let's explore what kan's discovered about what really drives economic activity let's start with kan's fundamental Insight what really drives economies isn't Supply it's demand specifically what economists call aggregate demand the total spending in an economy think of the last recession you lived through companies weren't struggling because they forgot how to make things the problem was simpler and more complex at the same time people stopped spending here's how it works when uncertainty Rises people in businesses naturally become cautious you postpone buying a new car companies delay building new factories each decision seems perfectly rational on its own after all who doesn't want to be careful during uncertain times but here's the Paradox kan's identified your spending is someone else's income when everyone tries to save at once we create the very downturn everyone was worried about and that's not even the scary part each dollar not spent has an impact far beyond its face value the multiplier effect is what turns a small economic hiccup into a full-blown crisis or on the bright side what can turn a modest investment into widespread growth let's say a company cancels construction of a $10 million Factory it's not just $10 million that vanishes from the economy the construction workers who would have been hired now can't spend at local businesses those businesses then order less inventory their suppliers scale back production and their workers have less to spend like a financial game of dominoes the initial $10 million drop might reduce total economic activity by $30 million or more but if the math is this straightforward why can't we predict or prevent economic crises turns out economic decisions aren't always about the math here's where rational economic theory meets irrational human behavior Kane's observed that markets aren't moved by pure mathematics they're driven by human psychology or what he called animal spirits take the cryptocurrency boom traditional economics might explain why digital currencies have value but it can't fully account for why Bitcoin can soar on a tweet from Elon Musk or crash on news from China these waves of optimism and pessimism conf confidence and fear Drive investment decisions far more than careful calculation this isn't just about speculative markets business investment hiring decisions and even government policies are all influenced by these psychological factors when confidence Falls no amount of positive data can convince investors to take risks so if psychology can override economics how do we prevent total collapse if markets are driven by psychology as much as mathematics waiting for them to self-correct is like expecting a panicked crowd to calm down on its own sometimes you need someone to step in and restore confidence this is where government policy enters the picture KES proposed two main tools fiscal policy and monetary policy think of them as the accelerator and break pedals for the economy fiscal policy is when the government directly influenc es spending during a downturn while everyone else is cutting back the government steps in as the spender of Last Resort building infrastructure funding research or even sending stimulus checks the goal is to counter that downward spiral we saw with the multiplier effect take the 2020 pandemic response when businesses shut down and people stay at home government's worldwide rolled out unprecedented stimulus packages was it perfect number but it helped prevent the co recession from becoming another Great Depression monetary policy managed by central banks works by controlling the cost and availability of money by adjusting interest rates and money supply they try to influence borrowing spending and investment decisions it's like trying to calibrate the temperature of the economy not too hot inflation not too cold recession but these tools come with their own challenges after all if fixing the economy was as simple as pressing a button modern economic crises have become a stress test for Keynesian Theory during the 2008 financial crisis governments faced a classic Keynesian moment private spending collapsed confidence evaporated and markets spiraled downward the response massive stimulus packages near zero interest rates and direct Market intervention did it work well we avoided another great depression but the recovery revealed new challenges Kane's never had to consider in our globalized economy stimulus spending often leaks overseas zero interest rates can create asset Bubbles and government debt well that's become a debate all its own the 2020 pandemic added another wrinkle when policy makers deployed the Keynesian Playbook at unprecedented speed and scale we got to see its limitations in real time stimulus checks revealed the challenge of targeting some who needed help didn't get enough While others got more than they needed near zero interest rates worked until inflation forced a dramatic reversal even the multiplier effect proved more complex in a supply constrained economy yet despite these challenges Keynesian insights remain fundamental to understanding Market behavior and crafting crisis responses so what's the verdict on Keynesian economics like markets themselves it's complicated Keynesian economics isn't perfect no economic theory is but it gives us something invaluable a framework for understanding why markets break down and tools for preventing economic collapse modern economies face challenges can's never imagined instant Global Capital flows digital currencies automated trading yet his core Insight remains relevant markets aren't self-correcting machines they're networks of human decisions and sometimes humans need a little help making better ones whether you're facing an exam managing Investments or trying to make sense of economic headlines understanding these principles matters more than ever if you found this helpful help others find it too like subscribe and share economic literacy might not prevent the next Crisis but it can help us handle it better
