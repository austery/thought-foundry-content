but when you take a longer term view you make fewer decisions the fewer decisions you make the better they tend to be you know if you make one decision a month it tends to be better and if you make 10 a day good afternoon everybody uh welcome to another session of of Goldman Sachs talks and I'm delighted to be joined today by the CEO of noris Bank investment management Nikolai tangon so first of all let's welcome Nikolai to Goldman Sachs so Nikolai is responsible for the management of the government pension fund um it's the world's largest Sven weth fund um owning about 1.4% of the world's listed companies Nikolai also runs the daily operations of NES Bank investment management he was previously the chief executive officer and chief investment officer of AKO Capital One of Europe's top investment management firms Nikolai founded AKO capital and also established the AKO Foundation which aims to support educ ation promote the Arts and combat climate change we're obviously going to talk to Nikolai about noris Bank how Investments can drive change leadership and what he's learned from some of the top leaders in the world from your podcast so um I'm looking forward to talking about that and so if it's okay we're going to kind of Jump Right In so cool okay well so you're coming up on your fifth year anniversary as a CO of noras Bank investment management Norway's $1.7 trillion investment fund and the fund is up 60% C that you took over in 2020 talk about the responsibility of stewarding you know a pool of capital this large talk a little bit about how you kind of think about that responsibility and how it's kind of framed the way you've tried to set this up over the P five years yeah it's a you know it's a big responsibility because it's uh it's such a kind of big fund for a very small country and um despite we only use 2 and a half% of the fund every year it it provides more than 20% of the state budget and we have on our website a ticker which is the live value of the fund and is updated 13 times per second so uh pretty kind of live and it's the most watched number in the country so everybody is focusing in on it so um big responsibility but it's made easier by the fact that we have a mandate a really really good mandate which is uh basically made by the Ministry of Finance and it's got broad politically uh it's broadly politically anchored so all the political parties agree with what we're doing it means that they will not change their mind at the wrong time and so that's good and then also of course I don't do it on my own we are 700 people uh really really great team and um and then you know um yes there are a lot of zeros uh in uh you know 19,000 billion Norwegian Groner but you don't really think about those numbers right you think about doing the right thing doing the right processes and then the numbers would follow yeah I I know that that some of the guiding principles are to be long-term oriented and diversified but talk a little bit about how you decide where to invest yeah and how do you decide where not to invest yeah so um again the ministry has this mandate um and but at the same time we have to do it in a in a you know ethical way so we have a separate Council of Ethics which decides where we cannot invest we don't invest in in Coal uh weapons and so on and there are some countries where we don't invest and so uh you know that's kind of the broad the broad picture we are very Diversified we are we own uh some 9,000 companies uh across the whole world in Europe we own a bit more close to well two and a half to 3% across Europe yeah yeah so so I know that one of the things that that that you've said repeatedly is you really aim to be the most transparent investment Fund in the world talk a little bit about the benefits of transparency when you're running an investment pool like this and how you think about you know transparency as a principle yeah I to me transparency is like totally key uh transparency increases trust you know if the more uh your clients can see the more they trust you we uh disclose every holding we have twice a year um and we are the most transparent fun in the world there's actually a world championship in transparency is there yeah and for for a period of time didn't know that that's that's the sport I'm doing uh now for a while the Canadians were number one and I thought hey it's fine that the Canadians beat us in ice hockey but it's not fine that they beat us in transparency well I don't know that it's really fine that they beat you in ice hocky W but so so last year for the first time we we became the world champion that's awesome yeah I want to talk a little bit about climate because I know it's a it's an area of focus for you talk a little bit about the private sector the role the private sector should play the role investors play when it comes to the environment and sustainability do you do you see how do you think about the long-term investment opportunity around these long cycle transition issues well so so we care about climate because it is a Financial Risk mhm we see it now in a lot of the commodity uh prices you see it in you know coffee olive oil orange juice all these kind of things where you know the prices are going up because Harvest harvests are worse because of the climate so they are so climate and the financial Market is linked in a different way than it has been before um so we spend a lot of time working with our companies making sure they do the right thing on climate I appreciate there's been a backlash in the US we haven't really seen that to the same extent in Europe and for sure in Norway we continue to to have the same opinions as we've had uh before I think there are investment opportunities in that space as well now which are better than before we got uh the opportunity to uh invest in renewable infrastructure four years ago and in the beginning we were just like really really slow because we thought the returns were too low too many people changing the deals but now that's changed so we think there are better returns in the space there's a bit more supplies so you can deploy more capital and we have beefed up the team and and doing more than that in renewable infrastructure specifically or or more broadland talk a little your your five years in kind of frame for me what are what are a handful of kind of key accomplishments in these first five years and what are a handful of the most important learnings yeah um yeah so first of all it's it's not me right it's about uh uh the big team but what have we focused in on well we focused in on on performance of course because without performance we have no reason to be um and it's very much about learning from mistakes it's we've created this uh investment simulator where all the data from every PM is up in up in the cloud and when you want to make a decision you get it all fed back to you all your weaknesses all your bad habits you know are you normally uh selling losers too late are you selling winners too early when you trade you basically get all these signals fed back to you and so that's been a big development which is now starting to change investment Behavior it's really cool very good um we're also working on getting people to be more contrarian in the trades they do and more longterm you know the most difficult thing is to be longterm why is it so difficult why you come to work on a Monday and it's just like you come home and you tell your husband you know and he asks you what did you do today well I did nothing you know Tuesday nothing nothing Wednesday nothing Thursday nothing you know you don't feel great about it and so sometimes the best thing is not to do very much but it's very profitable you know compounding is just amazing compounding compounding is a powerful thing unb that's what we're doing on investment side on the people side more development of people we are recruiting we are recruiting better people on the communication side much more transparency more internal communication more external communication and then operational robustness better and you know more focus in on Cyber so we we just done a lot of thanks you're a shareholder you you mentioned 9,000 companies I know Goldman Sachs is one of those companies we appreciate that we thank you for all your hard work we're working we're working hard and because you guys are working hard we're working hard we're working hard what um talk a little bit about investor dialogue what makes for an effective investor dialogue and how important is investor dialogue for you with respect to the companies it's very very important um we have more than 3,000 meetings a year with our companies we uh you know we turn up at uh nearly 10,000 agms we vote on uh 120,000 proposals we know we got a be big machinery uh doing this I think the key is to have very clear expectations and so we have this set up in uh set out in expectation documents it's important to be consistent over time so that you as a CEO know that we are not like changing our mind all the time one of the things I found very interesting about our dialogue with you is you know I I would say you know your team when they deal with us they are deep in the weeds Deep In The Weeds um on really trying to understand how we're thinking about things do you how do do you do that by industry sector do you do that how do you do that in the context of we have we have industry sectors we got some really strong sectors I think our banking team is uh is really superb um so that's how we do it now you know there are two ways you can deal with problems as a as an owner you can just you can sell your holding or you can go into a dialogue now what what kind of problem do you solve by selling your holding nothing you know let's say now you have a company which is doing you know not so good stuff on climate you sell everybody sells the holding what happens well you the company ends up in the hands of people who don't care you know so it's just not good it's better to hold it and to talk and to Advocate and to engage it's like when you feel like when you have a problem at home you can just is kind of sold off or you can try to fix it that's the try to fix it is a better strategy often yeah listen and understand first yeah yeah so in the first half of 2024 your fund post posted $138 billion in profit largely and kind of the acceleration of large cap Tech talk a little bit let's talk a little bit about AI yeah kind of the future of AI investment what what are some of the risks of concentration in the market I mean at the moment you know when you you look at kind of the large cap indexes and what's going on you have enormous concentration and if you're not you know overweighted to this handful of stocks you're going to unperformed talk a little bit about how you thinking about yeah it's a it's a level of concentration we've never seen before right M uh as you know hugely concentrated in very few names the big problem here in my mind is that they are all linked into the same geopolitical risk and so we have not seen before one the concentration we seen two the link with geopolitical risk and that's just very risky and so I think the risk in the public market is um probably higher than in the private market now yeah yeah and in the past you know we looked at kind of risks well uh Public Market not risky private Market very risky I think perhaps it's changed so talk since you raised the private Market talk a little bit about kind of you know private Market talk a little bit about the fact that you know obviously in public markets we have a narrowing of lised companies um we also I think you know given the burden of operating you know as a public company um you know we have people waiting longer um to take markets you know take companies to the public market there's more availability of capital in a private form how do you think about the private the private markets how do you think about the growth of private Capital um where do you think we are you know more secular growth well I think it's very interesting you know you now have supposedly the number of listed companies in the US has gone from 8,000 to 4,000 you're seeing the same development in Europe using it pretty much all over the place private Market companies stay private for longer they get bigger uh and so on so um I mean unfortunately it's a space where we are not operating yeah so it's not in our mandate to be in the private market and but there is a political process so so it may change but not for now um you know I think ideally one should be in in both 6% annual returns that of steadiness that reliability has earned enormous trust from the people of Norway um some critics probably say you can perform at a higher rate yeah how do you how do you think about that how do you how do you view because there's no question you know risk reward has to be balanced when you think about long-term returns how do you kind of Benchmark how do you think about that yeah again um coming back to this uh mandate that we have for the ministry which in Broad terms you know lay out how we should be invested we have we have roughly 70 % in equities 30% in bonds we have uh a real estate portfolio where we got like thousand properties around the world we got quite a lot of ownership on you know air on Manhattan as well um so um it the returns could have been higher historically had we been in private markets but uh you know we are not um you know we have compounded between 6 and 7% for the last 28 years and um and that's been good so so you look at the value of the fund now onethird of the fund is uh the value of money that the government has put in and 2/3 is returns yeah so it's quite it's quite amazing in a way we found oil twice one on the Norwegian shelf y second time in financial markets yeah when you think about um kind of risk reward you know over a long period of time and you think about compounding you know in particular when you own a great asset will you own it forever do you feel like if you really had an incredible asset you say we're going to own this for 50 years uh personally yes mhm that's the way I would construct the portfolio now when you have portfolio managers who are incentivized on a let's say three-year rolling basis it's difficult to get people not to trade very much and so we try to extend the time Horizon on this um we are probably going to put in a a fiveyear element in the comp um which I think you need to do to get people to kind of take a longer view a longterm view because you take a longer term view um you make fewer decisions the fewer decisions you make the better that tend to be you know if you make one decision a month it tends to be better and if you make 10 a day right sure you save of course uh I mean of course you you would hate to hear this but you save trading commission and so I don't really hate to hear it because I think it's I think it's fundamentally right I you know I love the fact though that there are so many incentive schemes that actually force people to create velocity around Capital but I you know one of the things it's one of the things I've never really understood is when you think about the way the whole private Capital Market is structured it's actually structured to create velocity of capital and you know I think you know I think most Pension funds just to take a broad example not specific to you at all but most Pension funds you know have much much longer dat of liabilities and so you know why if you're allocating your money to a private Equity manager just to pick one you know one form of private Capital why would you rather that they own something for four or five years and have an incentive system create velocity around it instead of to try to find they own a great company that can compound at 8 to 10% okay you want them to own it for 30 years or 40 years but there's very little the whole financial Market incentive system is not set up to do that absolutely but everything is moving faster you know there's more frequent trading sure um you know uh you'd be surprised to hear but over the last 30 years people talk and walk 10% faster so you measure average speed of walking in a city and um you know compared to 30 years ago you are 10% faster I mean not you but I've always been a fast Walker you've always been fast I think I I think IED just as fast now as I did 30 years ago yeah I'm I'm wondering whether the companies Sho I might talk a little bit slower now because unfortunately now people are listening to everything I say so I've got to talk slower but but um but but the walking things into people people there's certainly an intensity yeah especially around markets there's an intensity that didn't exist 34 yeah it's it's Market it's all you know we always on uh you know mobile phones uh uh it's 247 more activ yeah 247 for sure let's let's shift gears you launched this terrific podcast in Good Company in 2022 all about leadership um I was Lu the second guest was you I was the second guest I was say I was lucky to be a guest thank you for making me the second guest I didn't realize I was the second guest who was the first guest uh was the CEO BP oh but when you came on you know it was really cool because you know you started saying it was a pilot I didn't know whether it was good fly or not and uh and bang you get the SEO of Goldman Sachs wow big deal you know so then we thought hey this could perhaps be a serious thing and now it's the biggest now is one of the leading business podast in the world you know one of them and uh uh yeah it's it's fun no it's a big podcast but I mean think about this okay have anybody listen to any anybody listen anybody heard the podcast yeah the the CEO what's what's wrong with the rest of you start listening to the podcast the CEO of the largest Sovereign wealth fund and a significant shareholder in Goldman Sachs calls and says hey will you go on my podcast let me think about it okay I me that was not that was not a tough ask it was you I was really impressed because you responded within five minutes okay well I I try to be very very responsive but let's let's talk about the the podcast yeah you've interviewed dozens of CEOs at this point dozens of CEOs yeah what similarities do you see yeah it's uh very interesting because when you kind of cut them up into pieces and throw them up in the air and see where they land it's uh CEOs have a lot of uh similarities right um there is a lot of focus on uh on grit there is generally high level of energy I would say curiosity is very high up on the list so um yeah they have quite a little things in common is good leadership changing and evolving I think it is I think it is I think there is um more focus in on listening skills there is more on empathy um there is more on generally involving uh you know the people you work with in strategy development and so on and I think it makes it easier to actually execute and I also think the empathy element uh I think is more important than ever before in a time of AI that we lean on what it is that makes us human and then I think there is a really interesting thing with the Indian leaders you know people with Indian backgrounds because they kind of broke through the glass ceiling and taken over the whole you know Silicon Valley right so what what what is it that they bring well I think they are more uh in the know in what they're doing um there is something that the firm is bigger than themselves uh there is a lot of focus on empathy you know such as sa Adella who talks about a huge empathetic very big on that um and that there is no uh there is no uh trade-off between empathy and execution you know it goes hand in hand so I I I think leadership is moving are there differences in regions uh yes you know I suspect uh us leaders are bit more extrovert uh uh probably take a bit more risks than we do in Europe um Scandinavian is you think that's a positive well I actually think it's yes it is a positive and it explains part of why we have a bit of a problem in Europe uh we don't take enough risks you know there is is combined with regulation and so on but the risk appetite and the level of ambition in America is really driving growth yeah the Innovation economy here and the willingness of people to start businesses take risk innovate Drive growth is definitely contributing to kind of US economic yeah absolutely but also also the absolutely and so so that's a bit of a cultural difference yeah when you look at these Leadership Lessons you know as you talk to different leaders do you find yourself incorporating it somehow into the way you run the fund totally can you give a concrete example I tried to trying to integrate all the good stuff I learned it's really really uh interesting right I I mean we we try to steal everywhere we can talk about some I mean not money but I mean ideas by the way you know imitation is the highest form of FL absolutely totally talk talk about some of your favorite guests what characteristics do they share As Leaders uh well I think uh I mean in addition to you of course yeah put me aside um no I think you can put them into different categories of course speaking to the tech leaders is amazing right so you speak to Sam Olman yanson hang Bill Gates and so on and and they they basically look into the future you know um they see what it looks like and they and and you learn that I think some of the people who are from different different places than actually Finance is quite fun right we did Magnus Carlson the best chess player in the world comparing chess strategy with investment strategy which like wow you know when do you take risks do you take more risks after you lost or or do you take less risk you know very oppos very different from what what we typically do so just a lot of uh learnings from that um stoltenberg the NATO Secretary General on geopolitics and so on and then um some of the real long-term thinkers like the walberg's in Sweden really interesting I would say it's perhaps the one thing that characterizes great investors it's uh conviction and the ability to be contrarian and not think about what other people think and then be able to change and the combination stubborn and be able to change your mind really really rare that's a great great way to frame it what advice can you share about steps leaders should prioritize when they take a new job to lead an organization I understand when you took this job you actually kind of had a road map or a list of priorities that you wanted to follow you have do you have advice around that yeah it was great so I got this job uh I rang the best C I've ever met and I said hey I got this new job what should I do like well what you should do that's easy you first have to talk to a lot of people in The Firm do it before you start your job then you show respect uh they need need to get to know you and you need to get to know them you get more data points so you make better decisions they feel included they feel heard so that when you CH make changes they will be with you then you put together a leader group you do not hire people from the outside during your first year you define you define your DNA of the firm and you show everybody else in the firm that you respect what they do and then you make changes as a combined leadership group you mustn't do it on your own because you can trigger what is called the kind of the corporate immune system where basically they squeeze you out so you do it as a combined group and then you pick a few things not too many and don't do them don't make them the changes too fast the people who fail other the people who try to do too much too fast yeah and so we we made changes and I think twice we felt that we were moving a bit too fast and we slow down but I think that's the way to do it you you mentioned Grit tole i' I've I've always thought the grit is a you know not just for leadership but kind of for success in life in business you know the grit is a hugely hugely you know valuable personal characteristic talk a little bit about how you think about grit and how it how it plays a role as people approach challenges ah it's it's totally key it's just how you cope with things right I think you can it's it's sometimes difficult to screen for it but you when you hire you see what people have been doing so I was interviewing this guy for uh for a summer program he like hey what are you um what have you done during your Summers I worked in a bakery okay but I'm mean uh seven summers in a row yeah I mean do you know when you need to wake up to work in a bakery it's like 3: in the morning super early super early so we try to find it and I think you know we are in a world where there is perhaps a bit less grit than before um the younger generation have uh on average according to the Specialists a bit less great because they've been protected by the parents you know parents are taking all the you know a lot of the decisions and the problems and so therefore we have had less um problems to cope with you think that's you think that's you think that's permanent or you think that's cyclical well so that's interesting U but I do think it also it explains some of the you know it's not easy to be young these days and it could be that you just have had too much protection I think it's cyclical because I think the next generation is just like hey you know what my parents kind of screwed me up I'm certainly not going to do the same mistake and so I think he's going to get you know into that kind of stuff in other words my parents didn't get a hoot what I was doing you know I mean they basically said come home when the street lights go on absolutely okay that certainly wasn't the way my kids grow up yeah I mean you know my I remember my father he said uh Nikolai have you heard about the hedge fund he like Daddy I've been I worked for hedg for 10 years now shift gears you're passionate about European competitiveness and it was interesting what you said a few moments ago when we were talking about you know innovation and and regulation I mean I just I I would just observe one of the things that that you know I saw you know recently that just kind of I I I thought you know the European Union got so wrong was when the regulatory infrastructure came out and said we have to protect Europe from AI it's almost like the opposite how do we encourage Europe to be taking risks and investing in in AI talk a little bit about what Europe can do to be more competitive yeah it's a very very difficult question right um I mean on AI we think it needs some kind of Regulation and oversight but the thing is that in Europe we have a lot of Regulation and in my mind regulations are one one one by one they're pretty good right there's a reason why you regulate that and why you regulate that and why you regulate that but it's a bit like you come into a bar and each bottle tastes pretty good but when you put everything into a bucket it doesn't taste so good Long Island Ice te yeah well that's only like six six it's only six yeah or whatever uh so it's very regulated and um and I think that the kind of the heavy level of Regulation combined with uh kind of competition Authority which has insisted that there should be huge competition in all areas in all countries means that you have a pretty fragmented market right there is not one big Bank uh in every country you have three Telecom operators so you basically have nearly 30 in the whole of Europe whil three in the whole of the us so you get uh quite small players in a lot of different places and that means that they are not globally competitive now this may be changing uh hopefully and I think it does but you know there is a lot of stuff to do and if you want to read a good report on this it's a druggy report which came out a little while back really report it's just the kind of things we need to do now what you need to do takes it costs a lot of money and it takes strong political will and so we'll see what happens leadership takes leadership takes leadership yeah it's is not easy yeah yeah so to live in Europe and in in America uh is pretty good yeah I was going to say Europe is a great place to live it's a fantastic place to live yeah and you know there are some really serious questions about kind of social Fabric and and those kind of things right and uh and social protection um and for sure we have that in Europe yeah I mean one of the things that I've found fascinating is I've gotten to know you over the last you know five six years is you love to learn you have lots of diverse interests you know outside of Finance including degrees you've completed as an adult in art history and Social Psychology talk a little bit about getting those degrees as an adult and how it's affected you know kind of the way you invest how it's affected kind of your thought process around life yeah so it depends on you know how do you how do you measure your life some people measure their success in in money I don't do that I think you know some people think the people who's got the most money when he or she dies is has won so I think that's totally wrong I think think they have lost because first of all they should have given it away right but I think the person who knows the most when he or she dies they are the winners so you need to learn as much as you can and so you know I tried to learn all the time so um uh and I think the one of the most interesting thing I've studied is uh social psychology because there it kind of teaches you how people think what kind of risk they take what what are the drivers in their lives and so on and we've put quite a lot of that into work in the fund uh it's the whole idea behind the uh the investment simulator it's just how you can learn and how you know what are your weaknesses as a Trader and so on that comes from that how you use your analysis versus gut feel or pattern recognition that's interesting you know how you cope with being contrarian all these kind of things so um I do think it's very interesting how you can combine things with finance and most of the Innovations these days come from how you combine uh you know information in new ways I think it's really fascinating you know you're touching a little bit on culture culture is hugely important success I read an article by a Norwegian author who praised your form of leadership saying I quote you embody the image of a modern Viking always in motion constantly active busy they were Keen uh to explore yeah um they supposedly they were very consensus driven MH so I don't know how they did that like hey which Village are we going to pillage uh let's vote for it uh but um but supposedly and it explains why why leadership form in the noric countries is more consensual uh supposedly somebody told me yeah um no I think you want you be curious I think you want to move around I think you want to do different things you know it's important not to be not to have too strong habits it's important to break them up so for instance you know do you know when during the holiday you are the most happy after it's over no uh the the the 43rd hour that's after which you start to get uh uh habituated with where you are as you come to these nice places really sunny it's wonderful wow Blue Water right that is just like amazing for the first 43 hours and then it starts to become habit and so you need to break it up you need to do some more things so for instance I live in uh in New York now for the whole of November it's fantastic fantastic I just you know times have never been more exciting I wake up in the morning I just cannot way to get out of bed and uh it's just never been more exciting and let's not forget that this is the world we live in right we have uh technology change has never been faster geopolitics never more exciting hey us election coming up really exciting too Nikolai thank you this has been terrific really appreciate you taking the time to do it thank you very much that was great really appreciate you doing it [Music]
