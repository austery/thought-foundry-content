In November 1994,
the then-UK Prime Minister John Major
bought the very first ticket
to launch the National Lottery.
A company called Camelot
won the contract to run that service,
and they did so for 30 years.
In fact, until just last year.
In that time, Camelot
brought millionaire riches
to over 7,000 people.
You will have seen some
of these people, I'm sure, on TV,
smiling and popping champagne.
You may have read about a similar number
of them in the tabloids,
making mistakes and going bankrupt.
Behind the scenes,
what you probably don't know,
is that Camelot made every effort
to support their winners
for their entire lifetime.
They understood the real impact
that a lottery win
can have on an individual.
To their great credit,
they stuck with their winners
and supported them
whatever happened to them.
Every winner was given a named
support person from Camelot,
someone who would celebrate with them,
who would be there
to offer a shoulder to cry on
when things went wrong.
The person who actually physically
brought the bottle of champagne
and the check to the home.
And in what must have been
somewhat of a comedown for them,
a fortnight after the win,
would organize a meeting
with an external money adviser.
I had the extraordinary privilege
for over a decade
to be one of those money advisers.
I saw people transported
to millionaire riches in an instant,
and I think that everyone here today
can learn something
from the winners that I met.
It may seem like quite
a cruel way to view it,
but the lottery is in many ways
like a laboratory experiment
in how we, as humans, react
to the acquisition of sudden wealth.
If you sell a business
for a million pounds,
or you inherit a million pounds,
you know, to an extent, what to expect.
You will have seen the money coming,
probably years in advance,
and you will have had time to plan for
and adapt to how that money
is going to impact on your life.
By definition, a lottery
winner knows nothing
until the moment their numbers are drawn.
They are catapulted
from whatever their situation is
into being millionaires in an instant.
Two thirds of adults in the UK
play the lottery at least once a year.
That's over 36 million of us.
Nothing else really unites us
in those kind of numbers.
Possibly sport, maybe politics, still,
I don't know.
So we must be doing it
because we want to win, right?
Because we think that that money
is going to change
our lives for the better.
Well, let me take you back several years.
It's a boiling hot summer's day,
and I'm sat in an office
with broken air conditioning.
I have very unwisely
chosen to wear a dark suit,
and I can feel sweat starting
to run down my tight shirt collar.
Sat opposite me is the most miserable man
I have ever met.
(Laughter)
This man has just won the lottery.
(Laughter)
Two weeks ago, he was a happy
and contented man.
He and his wife were due
to retire quite soon
and their pensions were ready
to cover their outgoings.
They had a good relationship
with their adult children
who lived nearby,
and a great network of friends.
They lived in a local community
that they felt a part of
and felt valued by.
They'd worked hard for an entire lifetime
to build a simple but happy life.
Into that context,
the injection of a lottery win
was causing more harm than it was good.
The win, as it sometimes happens,
had become known locally.
Friendships had started
to sour through jealousy.
Family members were popping
out of the woodwork
and claiming an entitlement
to a share in the win,
and in some cases,
demanding of them some of the money.
Two weeks after that initial
euphoric feeling of winning
and having your numbers come up,
this man was realizing
that it was going to be life-changing,
just not in the way he'd anticipated.
In fact, by the time I got
to have the meeting with him,
he and his wife
were already planning a move
to a different part of the country.
You see, all of us
have two budgets to spend
when we start in life.
The time that we have left
and the money that we're going
to accumulate along the way.
Most of us, if you're like me,
you start life
with lots in the time budget
and not very much in the money budget.
And we will start spending time
acquiring, amongst other things,
some of that money.
At some point, we probably
reach a point in life
where we feel a little bit
more financially comfortable,
but that often coincides with a sense
that maybe the time budget
is starting to shrink.
That, of course, can trigger
that classic mid- or later-life crisis.
You see, for our first winner,
he had the balance right,
and then the finger of fate pressed down
on the money side of the scales
and unbalanced everything for him.
Our second winner, by complete contrast,
was absolutely over the moon
when I met him for the first time.
He did not want to hear
about the potential pitfalls of a win.
He didn't want to hear
about my, in my opinion,
very clever planning strategies,
(Laughter)
all the ways in which the win
could support him
for the rest of his lifetime.
He was beautifully clear-eyed
about what he wanted.
And that was an expensive car.
He threw me at first when I met him,
because he confessed very early on
that he didn't have a driving license.
(Laughter)
Nor had he, it turned out,
Any plan to get one.
(Laughter)
Now lottery winners will, on average,
buy five cars with their win,
but typically that's to share
amongst family members.
This winner was planning
on spending the majority of his entire win
on a single car for himself.
Much as we would have done
with our donkeys
and our cattle hundreds of years ago,
he was even planning to build a new house
so that he could live
in a room above his new car.
(Laughter)
He'd even factored
in a window in his floor,
so he could sit up in bed
and stare at the car.
(Laughter)
It was a case of the purest consumerism,
owning an object simply to get
that warm glow of the ownership,
not to do anything with it.
On the face of it,
there is nothing wrong
with him spending his win
on something that's going
to make him happy.
It is, after all, his win.
But all the research tells us
that the endorphin rush we get
from the acquisition
of an object is fleeting.
It is not something
that hangs around for us.
So our last winner for today
is the one that has stuck
with me the most vividly
over the years.
They were a young couple
who worked full time,
both of them, to support
their young family
when the win came along.
They didn't want
to spend it on an exotic car,
but actually planned to spend
half of the win on their home
and they gave up their jobs
and lived on the other half.
Eighteen months later,
well, they had blown
through the entire fortune.
They had to return to their jobs
and their old lives pre-win.
But actually, this one
isn't a cautionary tale.
In this case, what I haven't told you
is they had a young son
who was severely disabled
and needed round-the-clock care.
The home improvements
weren't for the installation
of an indoor swimming pool
or gold-plated taps,
but rather adaptations
to the ground floor of their house
so their son could live more comfortably.
They saw their lottery win
for what it truly was,
a one-in-45-million chance
to live life as a family.
Yes, 18 months later, the money was gone,
but so was their son.
They traded in that fortune
for a lifetime of memories.
In my 25 years as a financial planner,
this remains the best investment
I've ever seen anyone make.
Hopefully, as we've seen,
winning the lottery is not a ticket
to some kind of utopia.
It's more of a test
of our existing values.
So if we're to learn
anything from these winners,
we need to examine
how we're living our own lives.
How are you spending your time
and your money budgets?
Are you acquiring life's real luxuries?
Quality time with other people,
health,
sleep
and guilt-free relaxation?
Now the good news is,
whether you feel like it or not,
the fact that you have the time
and resources to be here today,
listening to these wonderful
TEDx speakers,
means that you've already won
the global lottery.
All of us here have, in fact,
won the lottery of life already.
And so it just remains for me
to wish you all the very best
in how you spend
and invest those winnings.
Thank you.
(Applause)
