How can capitalism
help solve climate change?
I'm Steve Howard,
I'm vice chair of sustainability
at global investment firm Temasek.
I've been wrestling with this question
for about three decades.
Formerly I was chief
sustainability officer at IKEA.
I've helped set up several
climate change organizations.
We Mean Business Coalition,
the Climate Group,
and recently Tilt Collective.
And I've come to conclusions
that there are some real hard truths.
The first hard truth:
every business is a machine.
They are hardwired and softwired
to do what they do.
That's why they're really good at it.
Let me give you an example.
About 15 years ago,
I sat in the headquarters
of a global car manufacturer
with their chief technology officer.
I said to him, "Surely
the future is electric vehicles."
He slapped the table and said,
"Never, while I am CTO,
will we make an electric vehicle."
Now he’s absolutely right,
because he’s no longer CTO.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Amazingly enough,
I got a taxi the other day
in one of that company's
electric vehicles.
(Cheers)
But it's very easy to make that
about him and his leadership.
But I realized that day
that in the buildings around us,
there were hundreds
of proud, skilled engineers
who'd spent their careers
making ever-better
internal combustion engines.
The company had spent 100 years
perfecting global supply chains
for spark plugs and carburetors.
This was an internal
combustion engine vehicle company,
and change for companies like these
is incredibly hard.
And many companies, from manufacturing
to technology and even finance,
are hardwired and softwired
to do what they do.
Now of course, there are exceptions,
but they’re exactly that:
they’re exceptions.
And we’re sorely mistaken if we think
all companies will change
themselves by themselves.
My second truth is that financial markets
are incredibly short term.
The leader of a private bank
said to me recently,
"Steve, I've never met
a long-term investor."
A hedge fund leader said to me,
"Steve, you have to remember
we're profit-seeking creatures.
I wake up in the morning and think,
how much profit will I make today?
I go to bed at night and think,
how much profit did I make?"
So markets are baked in
to pursue short-term profit
over long-term value creation.
The other thing is
the free market has had a free ride.
If you asked an economist in the room,
they would talk about externalities.
It's external to the market,
but it's not external
to people and the planet.
These are the costs that are borne
of the impacts on nature,
of pollution,
the destruction of our habitats,
the impact on human health,
and of course, the dramatically escalating
costs of climate change.
They're not priced into the market.
The companies don't pay the bill.
Now economists can debate
the exact number,
but we know they're
in the trillions of dollars,
the bills mostly unpaid,
and it's rising by the day.
So how do we go
from short term to long term?
It's a difficult thing to do,
but if you're a long-term investor,
a large asset owner, a pension fund,
a sovereign wealth fund,
an endowment, a family office,
then you're exposed to the total economy.
The best guarantee
of your long-term financial success
is economic growth itself.
And we know an inclusive,
resilient economy
where we tackle climate change
is the one with the best economic growth.
Again, the numbers have been run
time and time again
on the impacts of unabated climate change.
Cambridge University did one recently.
Their estimate was unabated climate change
will wipe out a quarter of global GDP.
That's five Covid pandemics,
and it's a pandemic that doesn't go away.
So if you're a long-term investor,
if you're an asset allocator,
a principal owner of capital,
it's in your interests
to invest in solving climate change,
not just in the easy things to do,
but in the hard things to do
with conviction capital.
Now, at Temasek,
we are a longer-term investor.
We've just had our 50th anniversary.
Our purpose is so that
every generation prospers.
We have stakes
in some of the companies today
that were the companies that we had
when we started 50 years ago.
But in order to align ourselves
with climate change,
we had to rewire ourselves.
We had to measure
carbon portfolio emissions,
set carbon budgets,
put an internal carbon price in,
align our staff incentives with success,
set those targets,
engage all our portfolio companies.
And then we had to realign our strategies,
reskill our investment teams,
invest in new partnerships
and new platform companies
so that we had the capabilities
to invest in the sustainable businesses
of today and tomorrow.
Now our portfolio
of sustainability-aligned investments
is 40 billion SGD,
up a lot from a few billion
just a few years ago.
It’s growing, and it’s a start.
This is a journey we're on,
but we're well on the way.
The third truth:
policy is a master switch.
If we want to level the playing field
for climate technologies,
we need long, loud, legal policies.
This can unlock the investment
and get innovators innovating.
Long, if you have a technology
that takes ten years to develop,
there's no use having a policy
that's just one-year long.
You need it to last
a full investment cycle.
The policy must be loud.
The signal must be unmissable.
Legal means it must have teeth.
Compliance can't be optional.
Now, most businesses
don't embrace policies,
but they want clarity,
they want a level playing field.
And we know if we want
a free market to be a fair market,
policy is a master switch.
And in this environment we can say,
actually we need all the countries,
we need large countries
to have policy and not to roll them back.
But actually whether you're a city,
a state, a smaller country,
policy can be hugely powerful.
Let's take the Singapore CO2 tax,
the carbon tax in Singapore.
That's provided a price signal.
It's priced an externality
by putting a price on carbon.
It's allowed the businesses in Singapore,
including many of our portfolio companies,
to turn long-term targets
into concrete actions and plans
to decarbonize their business.
They can create the business case
because of that carbon price.
It's also had a link
to global carbon markets,
and global carbon markets
are going to be increasingly important
over the next decade,
because you can meet
some of your obligation for the tax
with international carbon credits.
So it's allowed our own
platform company, GenZero,
to invest with greater confidence
in projects that are removing
and reducing emissions elsewhere.
Nature-based solutions,
forest restoration projects.
Policy can be a carrot as well as a stick.
In Singapore, they went
for super fast regulatory approval
for plant-based proteins
and cell-cultivated meats.
If you're a startup, you measure time
in days and weeks, not years.
So being able to get to market quickly
and meet your customers,
test your products,
and get revenue in is invaluable.
Singapore has become a hub
for these companies now.
But it's not just for startups
that fast regulatory approval
and good planning is a big boon.
It's for big infrastructure
projects as well.
Why be tied up for years
if you can have effective, fast planning.
Then it gets green shovels in the ground
and green investment flowing.
My fourth truth is just a word.
It’s only one word,
and it’s a really important one.
Better.
I learned this when I was in IKEA.
And I'm going to give you an example.
When I started in IKEA,
we had some LED lights.
They were expensive,
sales were limited, and the light
was still harsh and stark.
But we knew because
it was so much more energy-efficient
and the technology was developing,
we knew they were the future.
So we set a target for ourselves
to go for 100 percent LEDs
across the business.
We aligned all our investments
with ever-better LEDs.
We communicated across the supply chains,
we used our own purchasing power
to secure finance for new factories
and production lines.
When we got to the LED
that was not just energy efficient
but was affordable
with a great quality of light,
the next best thing to daylight,
they flew off the shelves.
And we hit our target
of being able to only sell LEDs from 2015.
When you get to better,
you get scale really fast.
So if you look at the total
global lighting sector,
in 2010, it was less than
one percent LEDs,
more than 99 percent all the other
types of light bulbs.
By 2020, it was more than 60 percent.
We flipped the entire
global lighting sector
that had been around
for more than 100 years in a decade.
When you get to better,
you get to scale really fast.
And we know that there are
many other technologies
that have got to better.
They've moved from the green premium
to the green discount.
Solar. Wind. Batteries. Storage.
It's very exciting.
And when you get to better,
these technologies create platforms
for business model innovation.
Our impact investing partner, Leapfrog,
has invested in a startup in India.
It's a young startup,
they're doing battery swapping stations
for two-wheeler drivers
and auto rickshaw drivers.
So rather than have
a long queue to refuel,
you can drive in,
in two minutes
your battery is swapped out,
it's a fixed price,
you can have a cup of chai,
you drive away.
It's cleaner, it's cheaper, it's quieter,
it's mechanically more efficient.
The customers love it.
They've got 75,000 drivers
on their platform and growing.
They’re doing more
than three million swaps a month.
Now we know that there are
many other areas
where in emerging markets,
this business model innovation
with these better technologies --
pay-as-you-go solar
is a great example there --
but capital is scarce.
We need capital allocators
to allocate capital for emerging markets.
The other area where
it's really hard to find finance
is for those technologies
that haven't achieved
full commercial parity yet.
The big industrial plants
that are going for their first,
second or third of a kind plants,
sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen,
green cement, green steel,
those cell-cultivated meats
and plant-based proteins.
Now these industries, let's be clear,
are the industries of the future.
If you're an investor or a policymaker,
you have to know they're the future
and lean in behind them.
And it will be cleaner,
cheaper, better, faster, tastier future.
Let's take one example.
We have invested
at Temasek for a long time
in large real estate businesses.
They are big users of steel,
cement and concrete.
If you take cement
in the form of concrete,
it's the second most abundant material
we use after water,
30 billion tons a year,
eight percent of CO2.
It’s hyper-commoditized,
very slim margins, lots of sunk capital
in cement factories around the world.
It's hard to innovate, hard to transform.
We've invested in a company
that's got an end-of-pipe solution.
Basically, it's a bolt-on technology
that captures the CO2
that would otherwise cause climate change
and pollute the atmosphere,
it remineralizes it
and incorporates it back in the cement
so you get zero pollution and more cement.
But you need patient capital
behind these sort of companies.
That company alone has taken 100,000 hours
of R&D on the technology,
and it's going to need a lot of capital
to roll that out
across the cement industry.
I have an ask.
Yeah.
If you’re a policymaker,
let's go for long, loud,
legal policy regimes.
Let's make the free market a fair market.
Let's price externalities.
But this is going to unlock
a green industrial revolution
in your economy.
It's going to create
the green jobs of the future.
It's going to future-proof your economies.
If you're an asset allocator
or you influence one,
if you're in a pension fund,
if you're in an endowment,
a family office,
a sovereign wealth fund elsewhere
where you're allocating capital,
take a pot of patient long-term capital
and put it behind climate change --
not just for the easy things to do,
but for the hard things to do.
It's in your interest to do it,
and you'll be backing
the industries of the future.
I know many of the people in that sector,
and I am talking to you.
Remember the ask.
If you're an individual,
then actually maybe you
have a pension or some savings.
Look at your provider.
Ask them what their climate allocation is.
If they don't have a great answer,
move it somewhere else.
If you're a business leader
or an entrepreneur,
embrace change,
unlock opportunity and go for better.
Now this won't be easy,
but we've used this playbook before.
Good government policy and incentives.
Business innovation and investment.
We've ended acid rain,
we've closed the ozone hole,
we've harnessed the power
of the sun and the wind
to create the cheapest form
of energy on the planet.
And we have five billion years
of sun reserves.
We've also lit a billion homes with LEDs.
And we have to remember,
humanity wrote the rulebook.
We've created all the markets.
We've allowed externalities.
We write all the policies.
We've built all the machines.
But if we rewire capitalism,
we can help solve climate change.
Thank you.
(Applause)
