forber for we can build on that in the weeks to come great I'm going to refer to you some comments from the Washington Post on defense Cuts they're reporting that Pete Heth the defense secretary ordered senior leaders at the Pentagon and throughout the US military to develop plans for cutting 8% from the defense budget in each of the next five years are you aware of that plan uh I'm in contact with secretary hexit and we're working very closely and you know again I'm not going to jump the gun here on TV uh but I I think everything's on the table and can things work more efficiently when it comes to the defense budget we spent more last year on our interest payments than defense so are you hoping for 2025 to spend more on defense than the interest payments uh well it would depend how we got there too the does defense spending go down do does the interest bill go down we we'll see what that calculus is got to focus on tariffs too Revenue raising is a part of that story reciprocity National Security you want fair trade I think we all want fair trade the president has discussed reciprocal tariffs he's mentioned the Europeans also offered to drop Auto tariffs could we start there have the Europeans actually made that offer can you confirm that uh I haven't seen that uh but it's possible I think the good thing about President Trump's negotiating style is people put things that were they not on the table before on the table very quickly so that would be reciprocity and maybe negotiating but to offset the tax cuts where's the revenue raising so there there could be you know not everyone is going to uh give on every point right so you know the the Europeans seemingly put forward very quickly Auto tariffs but the not not every country is going going to do that my my view as I've said before China is the most imbalanced unbalanced economy and the history of the world and they are trying to export their way out of uh what is a very serious recession and the rest of the world can't do that they can't dump Chinese Goods they're going to have to rebalance their economy so for fore tariffs on Chinese Goods went up 10% and a lot of that again you Mexico Canada China that was in response to the fental crisis China's the only one though that those tariffs have actually stayed in place is that the opening Salvo how how high do you think Trump wants to go when it comes to Chinese tariffs well I'm not going to give away his negotiating hand on TV I I I do have my first call with my Chinese counterpart tomorrow morning so I look forward to a very productive discussion what's the first point you want to bring up uh that we we want to work together and you as we said uh a lot of the precursor ingredients from fentol originate in China so we really want to put a stop to that very quickly hey historically there's been some currency concerns with regards to China as well in the conversations we had you before taking up this post with you you mentioned that some countries some currencies are undervalued is China one of them is that something you'd like to remedy yeah well Jonathan what what I what I've said is make no mistake the US still has a strong dollar policy but that does not mean that bilaterally other countries can weaken their currencies versus the dollar or manipulate their currencies so but specifically on China China's very difficult currency to Value because I really think that when we think about the the value of the R&B it's in three different equilibrium you know on any academic model uh say purchasing power parody it's cheap on the other side you have 1.4 billion people who are subject to Capital controls and they want to get some of their money out of the country and then you have what I would call The X Factor if you put money into to China today what's your belief that you will get it out in 2 3 4 years so it's very difficult to come up with a point value of the currency you've talked about the desire to have a strong dollar policy for the United States but is a strong dollar at odds with the idea of bringing industrial production back to the United States and sort of speaks to some of the concerns about other countries trying to devalue their currencies well I I think that we will the necessarily have a strong dollar if we run good policies and I think we're going to run good policies if the we if if we cut the trade deficits when you when you think about the trade deficit is a combination of terms of trade value of the dollar and our own budget deficit so if we bring down the the budget deficit then you know I think everyone if we are deregulating if we are if we make the tax cuts permanent if we make the us more B business friendly then the everyone the you know all the reserve managers in the world all the private investors are going to want a piece of that and the dollar will be strong but you we will be able to uh push back on that the through uh good policies through productivity you know the you the US productivity I think that I've been meeting with a lot of the tech leaders lately and I think we are very close to the cusp of this AI finally coming into the productivity numbers do you think that a strong dollar is necessary in order to offset some of the cost that could be otherwise associated with the tariffs uh traditional economic theory would tell you that the dollar strengthens on the tariffs but you know who knows what we've already seen since the the dollar appreciation since November 5th you know markets live in the future so have we already priced in some of that and on the other side what we are trying to do is to get other economies to successfully rebalance my my conversation tomorrow uh with my and this is really just an introductory uh conversation but as we go down the road the Chinese need to rebalance their economy in favor of consumption that they are suppressing the consumer in favor of the business community so you know as that happens then they will increase their demand same thing in Europe you know Mario drogy for any any of your viewers who didn't see it Mario Drogi had a fantastic editorial uh this weekend in the financial times where he said look we have put the equivalent of more terrorists on ourselves more terorists on ourselves than the us could ever contemplate so could could you get a very strong Euro somehow they had an an Immaculate deregulation just quickly you're having this call with your Chinese counterpart will you see him next week at the G20 Finance Minister's meeting uh I I'm not going to Cape Town due to some domestic considerations uh I actually think that he's not attending either so think is that what he's told you uh this is the the readout that we've gotten okay so um and again uh I I also believe uh several of my other counterparts won't be there I I have been speaking and in contact with them regularly and then I will be seeing them at the spring IMF World Bank meetings in DC for B for for wanted to talk to you about National Security as well and the dollar has certainly got a role to play on that front the sanctions policy of the United States as we look back do you think that's been misused abused yeah excellent question Jonathan uh that when when I I came into treasury if you think about sort of Treasury is five five pieces there's IRS on one side the me on the other but you know the main focus of in the building at treasury is domestic Finance international finance that's what I've been doing for my career for 35 years I was able to hit the ground running on that uh the what we call TFI terrorism Finance uh is where my biggest learning curve is so I'm spending a lot of time on that and I'm reviewing the sanctions policies why do we do what we do have they been effective are we running a 21st century program as opposed to some outdated modalities well the current sanctions are in place on places like Russia to try to get Putin to negotiating table you are intricately involved in these in this deal you were just in ke you met with President zalinski Trump yesterday called zalinski a dictator without these elections and said that he better move fast or he's not going to have a country left does this language make it harder for you to get that minerals deal over the Finish Line well look I I I think president zalinski unfortunately uh escalated and has put some daylight between did he escalate the that the a lot of his remarks in Munich uh I I thought were inappropriate uh president zalinsky when I I met with him uh assured me that he'd be the signing the minerals deal in mic he has not um and look the the real purpose here and I think get turned into kind of this media circus that President Trump had a very elegant plan and it was bring the ukrainians closer to the US let's do this economic deal and the even Carl Ro in the Wall Street Journal this morning approves of it that the the US with greater economic interest in Ukraine provides a security Shield so the the sequencing of what was going to happen was bring the ukrainians closer to the US uh through economic ties convince the American people and the American public get them on side and then uh tell the Russians go to the negotiating table with a very folsome message that if we need to we will take sanctions up well what about tapping the Russian frozen assets some $300 billion would you force your European counterparts to not just have them Frozen but actually tap them Trump talks about repaying the American taxpayer shouldn't Russia be a part of that well what what's happening now is they are they are being tapped so the returns from interest the the the returns from the freezed asset pile the is going to pay the Europeans you know what what's very important to understand here is everything the US has done to date that the American people the American taxpayer is Grants the Europeans roughly half of what they've done are loans and the uh runoff from the frozen assets is being used to repay European loans Have you communicated that to the Europeans that you represent with them what's that have you communicated the Europeans that you repr sent with them I I I think vice president Vance did a pretty good job in M do you think they understand that the United States is running a deficit of north of 6% close to 7% and that the budget for defense is north of $800 billion do they think do you think they understand the gravity of the moment in the United States the US perspective look I I I think that they they understand that uh president Trump during his first term this term uh vice president Vance uh and the entire security apparat have told them that many of the countries are deficient in their NATO spending and they need to come up you know when when I went to Ukraine you fly into Poland Poland is spending almost 5% of GDP on defense and look at Poland sitting next to Ukraine Poland is one of the great economic success stories of the past 30 years after China they've had the fastest growth so you why couldn't Ukraine with the some US capital Ingenuity knowhow and root out some of the corruption do as well as their neighbors done if Europe spends more will it allow America to come back on defense spending is that the ultimate goal uh the the ultimate goal is for the the Europeans to uh come up to where they've said that they are going to and uh you know to provide uh their share of the NATO spending you mentioned sanctions so do you have both on the table ready to go a sanctions ramp up or wind down on Russia depending how these talks go I I think that'd be a very good characterization when it comes to the talks Trump still thinks he's going to meet with Putin he said probably by the end of the month the end of the month is next week are you preparing for that uh I I'm not going to give give away the timetable uh but the the the president is committed to ending this conflict very quickly and I'll tell you you you're in keev I went to a children's hospital that had been bombed and this was not a children's hospital where you take your child if he or she scrapes their like the the this was so you can imagine I I did that trip that you're talking about just a few months ago you can imagine why they haven't had elections in right they're living in this martial law uh they they are um and um it's probably a a necessary probably necessary to move forward with the Democratic process CE Sam we've covered a lot of topics one name that has not come up very much is Elon Musk let's finish there you've had some tremendous colleag in your experience over your career including the great investor stany draam Miller youve worked alongside Donald Trump through the campaign can you just describe what it's like to work with someone like Elon Musk someone as successful in American Business just what's that like day today yeah look you know Elon Musk like Stan dren Miller like I I I always compare they great business people to great athletes they keep their eye on the prize you know whether that he whether he's the um Messi or or Michael the Messi or Michael Jordan uh he is focused and his energy levels unbelievable and you he's gotten to where he has because everything's on the table like there there's always this examination of why are we doing it this way why are we doing what we're doing and most of all you know if something's not working let's fix it you know Sam ultman was on Bloomberg TV just two weeks ago and called Elon Musk insecure do you view him as such uh I I'm not going to get into the uh Tech magnet the the uh you know kind of uh slap F cly Besson I would say that's wise he is drawing criticism though when you in the administration come out and pick out the various things where money is being wasted on I think we can all agree that that's a waste of money where there might be some concern is the way that some people are being laid off in Washington that it lacks some dignity could you comment on that today look I I I think that uh Tax Act is designed to help you get your taxes done let's get them over with there many fine public servants and but I think that in I I've been in Washington three or four weeks now and there there's a real bias towards the status quo and if you don't move quickly then the then the lobbyists get involved the entrenched interest and and it's impossible to get anything done so you know any anyone who has experienced uh financial hardship the any kind of the uh mental duress uh you know I'm sorry for them but that's also what the average American experiences every day most of us you know you all come to work you want good ratings The you know you uh the you you get a performance readout you really push forward and I I can tell you that in treasury I have been so impressed with the quality of the permanent staff and I um I want to get everybody back to the office and a lot lot of people are on board with that when it comes to your prior life you didn't have a boss you said it would be like atrophy if you weren't trading financial markets every single day what is it like now to be in this position where you make decisions that people can trade against what you're doing and you also have a boss that sits pretty close to you in terms of the Treasury Department and The West Wing well look I I I only had my own firm for eight years so I I I worked with Mr Soros with Stan dren Miller and uh it's it's a great feedback mechanism and I I think I have the best position in in DC I'm on on the White House Camp campus uh we have a great staff in Treasury I can be in the oval in 4 minutes and um so the there there's proximity and um again not like Elon Musk pres president Trump is committed to shaking up the status quo he came in with a mandate and he's moving on it very quickly you're a total gentleman and you've been very gracious with your time thanks for being a good friend to this program over the last year secretary Besson there of the treasury secretary Besson thank you sir I'm here with us treasur [Music]
