[Sign up for the next episode] 每逢五一十一假期很多中國人就有一種深深的疲憊感 (The battle of Chibi) You think only road traffic Now even the water traffic During this holiday Guilin Lijiang Played the modern version of Chibi The camel army of Mingsha Mountain This is not traveling This is obviously attacking the bandits This is the Great Wall of Beijing So many people If it is attacking the city gate I will take it down in five minutes In the city of Xiyan, there is a netizen said It's not easy to squeeze in The meat in my hand I don't know who bit my mouth Traveling abroad was supposed to relax But for many Chinese It's become more painful than working More tired, more torturing Today we will talk about Why Chinese people's holidays are always so painful Hello, I'm Lao Zhou 美逢节假日,中国的景区就变成了灾难片现场归根结底,最核心的问题就是中国奇葩的调休制度把所有人的假期都集中到一起的结果就是全国人民一窝蜂出行扎堆旅游但我今天不是来简单的批评调休制度的我要谈的是一些更深层的东西 中国的调休政策已经持续了20多年每年一到假期都是怨声载道那为什么中共就是不改革呢这背后真正的原因并不只是刺激消费那么简单这其实是一套被隐藏的很深的社会控制机制调休并不是为人民服务的而是为体制服务的这个我后面再细讲 有人可能要說了老周你別亂講啦這跟調休沒關係這不是政府制度的問題中國就是人多啊沒辦法啊但其實人多根本就不是主要原因中國總人口是很多但其實人口密度並沒有大家想像的那麼高 Singapore is one of the most densely populated cities in the world 8,000 people per square kilometer Shanghai is only 3,900 people per square kilometer Less than half Beijing has a population density of only 1,330 people Only one-sixth of Singapore In fact, the population density of only Shenzhen and Dongguan Up to 4,000 people When did you see the scene of Singapore and Tokyo's holiday? Even when it was reported, it was reported by Chinese people who had gone on a trip between May 1st and October 1st. There are many people who are on holiday in Singapore and Tokyo, but it is definitely not a situation of a few-fold killing fish. Why? Because people are not on vacation at the same time as the whole society. China is forced to adjust, and force 1.4 billion people to be on a time point. 所以問題不在人多而在於讓所有人一起出動所以中國特色的人海假期真正的罪魁禍首只有一個那就是萬惡的調休制度除了擁堵的景區以外調休最可惡的地方就是這明明是一個讓中國人民集體受苦的政策卻要搞得好像是政府大發慈悲的在給人民提供的福利一樣 调休因为连续放假好几天所以总是给人一种错觉好像是政府给了你很多天假期一样但其实调休从来都不增加休息天数只是拆东墙补西墙而已比如刚过去的五一假期看起来好像是放了五天假但实际只有两天这五天当中其中两天本来就是周六周日另外一天需要员工在其中一个周末上班补回来 This is because this year's Wuyi has officially become a two-day holiday It used to be more miserable when there was only one day For example, last year's Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day holiday It was only five days of holiday After a holiday, it will be seven and a half days So what is the situation of holiday? 放长假之前连续上六天班放假出去玩的时候路上堵车景区排队十几个小时回城再堵车回到家里睡一个觉以后下周又要连续上六天班放个假结果累成狗还不如不放调休这种放假方式即便是不出去旅游只是在家里躺平的人也觉得非常讨厌因为打乱了生活节奏 There are many problems that the tourism in the concentration camp brings For example, the police station equipment can't handle the sudden mass of people It increases the risk of accidents For example, during this May Day holiday, a police station in Hebei, the "Motan project" Because there are too many people, the equipment is not working well Causing many people to be injured Travel in the city also implies that if there was an accident, there will be many people dead or injured. For example, during the 5/1, 4 boat boat were overturned by the Guizhou-Shenzhen oil port. According to the official report, 70 people fell into the water, 10 people died. 再比如你看看視頻裡的這種擁擠程度大大增加了傳染性疾病大規模傳播的風險這時有人可能要輸了誰不知道放假期間旅遊景點必定會出現這種情況呢每年一到長假社交媒體上全都是這些照片和視頻啊這些人為什麼還是要去跟人擠呢 但對很多人來說尤其是有孩子的家庭他們別無選擇這是他們全年唯一能有幾天假期的機會所以歸根結底的一個問題就是中國人的假期實在太少了 Most of the working people in the world The holiday is divided into two parts National holiday and New Year holiday Everyone puts the national holiday together But because people don't do the所有人集中在同一段時間內旅遊的問題 But in China, most people are not worried about the annual vacation. So the Chinese government put up the national holiday and weekend Then through the "Eastern" and "West" It's hard to get a long vacation So you ask why the "National" will be in this situation Or go to squeeze? Because without the annual vacation The "National" system is in the hands. The whole year, there were two long holidays which made people feel like they couldn't go out and feel like they were sorry for the holiday. When everyone was posting on social media it also made those who didn't go travel feel anxious. So, a good enough holiday is the root of all these problems. 其實中國是有關於企業必須給予員工代薪年休假的最低天數限定的根據中國法律10年工齡以下的至少5天20年工齡以下的至少10天20年以上的15天我相信任何在國外或外企工作過的人一定會覺得一年5天的年休假簡直就是匪夷所思居然還要熬20年才能有15天假期 我還記得當年我在中國第一次知道這個法律規定的時候真的震驚了因為我在美國畢業以後第一份工作在美國的匯豐銀行起步就是18天年假在公司每多待一年就可以再增加一天到第六年就有23天了 But in fact, the US does not have the minimum year-end date for the company's regulation of federal laws. In addition, the wind is originally Asian. So 18 days is already a little bit less. In the international law, many countries have established that the salary of employees given by the company is 20 days. For example, the law in France stipulates that the annual leave is no less than 25 working days The German law stipulates that the annual leave is at least 20 days But most companies actually provide a 30-day period of leave The British law stipulates that the annual leave is at least 28 days The same people still have a 10-day period of leave So in addition to double days, there are about 40 days of leave a year At this time, someone must say Don't take all the things to the developed countries and European and American countries China still needs to develop Suffering is the good quality of the Chinese people Bah-la-bah-la I can tell you China's annual leave is the top few in the world The country is poor and backward The annual leave of the people protected by the law Far more than China 你知道阿富汗和肯尼亚有多少天法律规定的最低代行年求假天数吗?我说了很多中国打工人可能真的要破防阿富汗20天肯尼亚21天野门22天叙利亚24天伊朗26天 Even the fraudulent nation in the eyes of the Chinese, The Jampuzhai also has 18 days. But you know what? Jampuzhai has a 27-day national holiday. So when combined, The Jampuzhai workers have 45 days a year. Speaking of which, I can tell those overseas audience friends, There must be many audiences within the comments area Can't sit there. They want to tell the old country, "The annual holiday, what is the annual holiday?" 沒錯,就算是這本來已經少得可憐的五天年休假其實絕大部分的中國人都享受不到法律規定的年假和雙休日基本上只有體制內的公務員跨國外資企業和一二線城市裡的大企業員工才能享受到 不要老拿北上广深来代表中国这个道理我已经讲过很多次了这四个城市里的8500万人只占中国人口的6%要了解真实的中国就去问问另外那13亿人去问问小城市里的工厂和中小型民营企业里的牛马不要说年价了连双修都做不到你等一下到评论区里看看有些公司别说是双修连单修都没有 In this situation, families with children 1-5-1-10-1 long vacation Even if the famous scenic spot is a fire pit We have to jump down with our heads down So do you still want to have children in China? Who dares to give birth to children in this situation? 所以根本的問題就在於中共政府企圖用調休來掩蓋中國人假期少得沒人性的這個事實而正是調休這種畸形的政策導致了中國獨有的沙丁魚景點風貌 好了 那麼現在問題就來了中共老是吹噓自己過去二十年來創造了經濟奇蹟人民幸福 各方面都已經遙遙領先了那既然如此為什麼就是不肯給人民更多的假期呢 In the past 20 years, Chinese GDP has been rising from the world's lowest to the world's middle level It's probably the 70th place in the world Don't all the economic miracles in China have to be due to the hard-working Chinese people? Chinese GDP is already the second in the world But the holiday for the people is still the world's lowest Even the mermaids in the production team have a break 所以接下來我們就要來探討一下為什麼中共對於給予老百姓更多的假期會如此抗拒呢?要知道,就連雙修制度都不是中共自願給人民的當初是為了加入WTO在美國人的要求下才不得已實施的 这一点爱党人士就不用跟我争辩了这可不是我自己瞎说的是中国双修政策的制定人之一魏晓安在2009年接受网易新闻采访的时候亲口说的 這樣國家才下決心調整雙修制這實際上是外力的一種錯誤因為就我們當時整個社會認識來說大家還沒有意識到制度需要調整所以 反美人士以後反美的時候還是小點聲吧沒有萬惡的美帝國主義你到現在連雙修日都享受不到 So why the CCP is so unwilling to give people holiday? But Marx never said holiday is evil Look at other communist countries Vietnam has 12 days holiday Laos 15 days Cuba has 22 days So why? I think there are several reasons below 第一,中国改革开放以来所获得的经济成就本质上靠的就是低成本劳动力驱动的经济模式用全世界最能吃苦、最少假期、最便宜的劳动人口来换取资本积累 这跟中国人本身的文化也并非没有关系在中国社会当中一个工作时间长不敢休假的工人往往会被美化为敬业、勤奋、刻苦耐劳是中华民族的美德等等即便现在大家的生活已经比20年前好很多了但这种观念不管是民间自身的观念还是官方宣传的口径这种歌颂苦难的文化依然没有改变 第二,中国人假期少也不仅仅是政府的原因中国人做生意的模式最后都靠一个字卷尤其中国大部分中小企业处在低附加值产业链不管做什么最后就是打价格战成本十块钱的东西你卖15块,我就卖12块你降价到11块,我干脆亏本卖9块看谁先死你死了,我就一家独大了 这种内卷的经济模式就导致极低的利润率在这种环境下工厂停工一天就意味着亏钱丢单竞争失败老板不敢停员工不敢修所以其实调休这种东西只是让中产牛马去消费的底层牛马还是得继续搞生产全中国就没有几家工厂能让员工连着五天放假的等你回来工厂都倒闭了 所以即便中國法律當中十年公領以下五天年休假的規定本身就已經少之又少但很多打工人根本不敢修就算修也不敢連著修很多人怕被領導排擠怕被穿小鞋怕影響績效考核 當然在這一點上政府也是難辭其咎的資本肯定是逐利的國外的資本家難道就不想壓榨員工嗎商業的本質不分中外所以才需要優良的制度和法律框架西方國家之所以給員工那麼多年休假除了文化因素更重要的是法律就是這麼規定的並且違反這些法律的企業必將受到嚴格的懲罰 但中國的勞動法在很多情況下基本上都形同虛設在企業不受監管的情況下員工當然是處於絕對劣勢的最很明顯的中共政府是刻意的不想管 因為只要政府有這個意願放假少的問題要解決是非常簡單的作為一個集權統治的國家你今天頒布法案說所有企業都必須提供不少於15天的年休假並且嚴格執行誰敢不遵守呢 Moreover, this is a very popular mistake The whole country will be happy to encourage Swear to the Communist Party So no matter how you look at it A few more days off There is no loss to the CCP Then why are they not willing to do it? This is the third point I want to talk about It is also the most important point Chinese people have very few holidays, and they have very hard holidays Because in the basic sense, the CCP does not want to give people too much time to rest In fact, the answer is in a book from thousands of years ago The "Military Book" has been made very clear One of the five martial arts of the Yumin is "Pi-Ming" The more tired the people are, the more stable the rulers are In plain words, the most disliked thing about a "極權體制" is the people who have too much free time 有閒暇就有時間讀書思考組織交流一放鬆就有可能開始反思我到底為什麼這麼累我的苦難真的是美國人造成的嗎還有最不能讓你思考的就是我為什麼不能選擇我自己的政府 你有没有发现,在中国社会和文化大环境里特别喜欢歌颂苦难并且主流媒体和舆论经常会用一种批判或讽刺的语气来看待西方的假期制度比如,资本主义培养了大量的蓝汉法国人放那么多家,还动不动就罢工怪不得欧洲没落了我们中国人吃苦耐劳才创造了今天的成就 所以放假可耻,勞動光榮那麼最後,除了不肯讓人民放假以外我們還要來探討,為什麼中共那麼熱衷於搞調休呢? 全国人民骂了20年他就是不改看牛马吵得太凶了年轻人恋爱不谈孩子不生了于是今年宁可再给你增加两天假期但还是要放到十一和五一当中去而不是去增加有弹性任何时候都可以修得年假为什么呢 其实调修是一种隐形的社会控制工具统一节奏控制舆论制造集体感通过全国统一的集体放假国家宣传机器可以精准预判国民的情绪节点和流量高峰从而提前安排议题与舆论引导假如政府想要引导民众情绪比如放大一个什么话题的流量长假就是一个非常好的时机 Especially after the economic situation in China has been deteriorating for the past few years, the CCP will not be able to cancel the reform. Because the whole nation is focused on the fake economy that can create prosperity. Although the scene during the long-term break is very self-satisfied, the official media will spread the word that the people's enthusiasm, consumption fire, and the economy will return to warmth. 所以現在你明白了嗎調修不是為人民服務的而是為國家機器服務的最後講兩句我的感想我不知道中共和習近平口中所謂中華民族的偉大復興和中國夢究竟意味著什麼是收復台灣登上月球還是GDP世界第一 But in my opinion, in all the red-and-white narrative If the people do not even have the right to choose when to take a vacation and whether they can take a vacation Then the so-called Chinese dream is actually just a dream of the ruler The so-called revival is just a gorgeous package of the Communist Party's solidification of the regime What does all this have to do with the people? 牛馬即便披上了盛世的華服依舊還是牛馬 [MUSIC]
