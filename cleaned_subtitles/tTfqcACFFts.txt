>> the Stock Movers Report, your roundup of companies making moves in the stock market, harnessing the power of Bloomberg data.
>> I'm Carol Masser along with Bailey Lipsheltz. Let's get to some stocks on the move today. Bloomberg News equities reporter Natalya Kenny Javich is here in studio. Let's talk about stocks on the move. Where do you want to start? I think I bet I know where you want to start. Maybe I don't know where you want to I
>> Papa John.
>> No, but I love that you're going to go there.
>> All right, so let's start with Papa John's. The ticker is PZZA. The stock jumped as much as 23% today, but closed about 10% higher. This is after Street Insider reported that the pizza operator received a $64 per share bid from Apollo Global Management. I have to point out that the company declined to come into Bloomberg, but sources told Street Insider that the private equity firm has been granted access to due diligence and potential deal could come just in a few weeks uh from now. Uh when I spoke with one analyst and I asked like why would it do it right now? He's like well first of all everything has a price. The company has been struggling. It's out underperforming Domino's Pizza,
>> especially after Domino's started uh collaborating with delivery services like Door Dash, Uber, and potentially probably it's more important that 2024 was a really tough year for quick uh restaurant services companies because consumers are becoming more picky, right? At the low end of the consumer chain,
>> we got to make choices and maybe it means no food delivery.
>> Yeah. a pandemic. Yes, definitely was a great time. But then I looked at the price uh stock price starting from October 2021, guys. Guess guess what? It's down by 63%.
>> Wow, that's a lot.
>> Even with today's move, it's only recouping losses from like the last four days. And Italy, I think it's interesting, as you mentioned, if you see a report that says $64 and it closes at 46, I think investors aren't buying it.
>> Yeah, exactly. I was surprised by that, right, that it didn't even uh move up to that. All right, let's go to LVS.
>> LVS, yes. Las Vegas sends the stock is down by 6% just as other uh Macau casino operators. It came as uh some industry reports showed that uh demand for casinos was weak. Uh particularly, I'm citing Jeffrey's data. They said that demand that includes the end of the golden week holiday in China was lower than expected. Macau gaming revenue for 7 days ended on October 12th was down 46% on a week-overweek basis. On a month of today basis, it's also disappointing. Um that implies about 5% year-over-year drop. So lots of concern. we see that these stocks are under pressure
>> and you're also seeing it like Golden Week is such a big event in Asia and if people aren't leaving mainland China to go gamble. The question comes back to how is the health of the Chinese consumer or the people at the top 10% uh if they aren't making those trips to I don't know bet on horses and kind of do everything else. Have you been to Macau?
>> No, I haven't.
>> Have you?
>> No.
>> No, I I was in Hong Kong but I didn't make the trip. I was told it's a glorified Vegas and I try to limit my time in Vegas, but that's I digress. Natalia, I think the stock that you want to end on is the one that Carol thought you start on.
>> Can I just say though, Las Vegas stands like not all gaming companies or gambling are the same, but they have incred like their exposure to Macau is a big one. So the China play is really important for them.
>> Yeah. And we saw win under pressure. So two of the three worst performers, we talked about that on TV. Two of the worst three performers in the SP500 all because of that exposure to Macau. Anyway, back to the green. Yeah,
>> all roads lead back to today.
>> Broadcom Broadcom the ticker is AVGO. The stock is up by 10% I should say. Uh 9.88. Uh today, of course, it came after OpenAI agreed to buy companies custom chips and networking equipment.
>> I had a dollar for every time I said Broadcom or OpenAI today.
>> I know. I know. Of course, it brings more positive sentiment across AI's uh names. I was looking at analysts reaction. Here's what I found. So for example, Millio's research set which has 140 or excuse me 415 price target. The stock is now trading at 356. They said that this deal would double AI revenue in 2026 and then double again in 2027. However, when we look at pri today's price reaction, vital knowledge analysts said that one of the biggest reasons why this stock jumped after earnings report is because Broadcom announced this partnership with Open AI and they said, it's a quote, it seems like the announcement this morning is a little bit recycled. So, investors knew that there was a pact between the two companies. W. Come on. How much time do we devote talking to this?
>> I still want to know what happens if if Open AI was public. Were the Would the shares be up or down today?
>> I have no idea.
>> Well, you know, they're they're spending.
>> We think they're we don't know who's spending it.
>> You're right. We don't like this is this is this vacuum that is AI and they are, you know, kind of
>> the poster child of all of it. And it's either going to be a massive win or I don't know, it could end badly. And we talked about it earlier. You're better off being wrong when everyone else is wrong than to be the one who sits it out. Allah Intel.
>> Well, that's the bet, right? And that's the risk right now.
