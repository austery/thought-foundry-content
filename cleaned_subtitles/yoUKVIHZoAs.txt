I'm about to break down everything you need to know about tech job market in 2025 including changes in the labor market skill requirements AI influence and changes in the talent acquisition strategies companies are racing to the office AI has taken over performance review younger generation is not willing to step into managerial roles and that fake it till you make it mentality is finally on the decline and if you're still writing your resume with Chad gbt you need to listen to this hopefully I can convince you to rethink it hi everybody this is area we're going to start with hiring optimism and labor market resilience based on the available information in 2025 we will be shifting towards a more balanced labor market rather than continuing being in a strong employers Market in the past 3 years several factors contribute to this 76% of employers plan to expand their headcount in 2025 according to a zip recruiter survey the job market is expected to to see the net growth of 7% in total employment or 78 million jobs between 2025 and 2030 job postings remain to be in the prepandemic level in many sectors indicating sustained demand for workers however despite the cooling Trends there are signs of continued labor market strength and employers optimism the market is still very saturated there is lots of political uncertainty especially North America and if we take into consideration the Tariff Wars that may or may not happen lots of people are still holding on to their jobs in anticipation of upcoming economic changes that may or may not follow as the consequence of potential tariff Wars I cannot emphasize this enough everything you're doing career-wise has to be viewed through the lens of current market conditions if you're feeling like you're behind and you're looking at a friend who has a job at Big Tech always ask when and how they got that job if you are trying to break into Fang and nothing's working for you you should not be talking to somebody who got that job in 2018 or even in 2020 that is an entirely different Universe the conditions of the job market that were present when your friend entered big Tech were polar opposite to where we are today if your friend had big logos before they got into Fang again that is a very different situation from what you're facing right now number two growing skill shortages skill shortages have been a significant problem for employers and recruitment teams for a while however the rapid pace of technological progress has made matters worse leaving business scrambling to find workers with the right skills we are slowly moving away from the era of generalists overcoming skill shortages in 2025 will require a multifaceted approach from the business side businesses will continue expanding their talent pools tapping into to passive candidates recent graduates and remote employees at the same time businesses will take a comprehensive approach to investing in continuous training and skill development of their employees now take this from your employer if they're offering that I see so many people around me who are not taking advantage of what their companies are offering them there are budgets allocated for your skill development and if the company's not forcing you to do it you should be proactive about it because that's free money free you also consider the company's willingness to invest in your education when making your next move especially if your early career here's an example from my own experience I worked at a company that promised that they would make investments into my education and skill development when I was accepting their offer the promises were very generic they were not documented they were just verbal promises but when I joined the company it turned out that every team got allocated a certain budget and that budget was split between the number of members on every team so if your team got $1,000 and you had 10 employees on the team every single one of you would get only $100 and $100 is nothing for a good quality education and I got offered $500 a year which in the end was not enough even for one course at reforge so if skill development is something that matters to you make sure that it's stipulated in your contract number three rise of individual contributors in Tech this is the most interesting Trend and the one I'm incredibly excited about because I no longer feel like a fraud before I talk about it I want to give a very quick example from a personal experience I never wanted to become a manager I never had this ambition and I never looked at people managers as someone I aspired to be one day and that is because the way I thought about being a people manager is that I think it should be given to people who truly are earned it not waited out long enough at the company and then everybody else left and you were the only candidate for the job but because they actually earned it with their intelligent quantifiable outcomes and a very high level of emotional intelligence that would give you an ability to lead other people to me this job comes with numerous responsibilities and very high level of stress and I personally would rather spend that time investing in my skills and my own personal development as a product management professional rather than coaching others I always thought that a person becoming a manager has to be incredibly skilled they have to be very good at what they do already and they have to be very good at leading other people however historically and up until very recently the standard progression in most corporate rules including Tech was Junior intermediate senior manager it was kind of expected that you would eventually become a manager once you are doing well enough in your senior role as an individual contributor and even when I was younger just starting my career I kept thinking what I would do when I passed the senior level because I never wanted to be a manager my goal has always been to gain very intense competence in what I do I do not abide by tactics where you document every single thing you do during the day and then you create a larger than life story for your management team and then you start working for those Optics and that's how you make your way into the managerial role climbing that corporate ladder by not being intensely competent but by knowing who to talk to and who to show your face to because I think that even if you manage to build a career by being very tactical and very calculated about your moves and things that you do eventually your lack of skill will show there is nothing I hate more than this freaking expression fake it till you make it I think that we as a society have a lot of problems on a global level because there are a lot of people that are very good at faking it I had the same perception of a role of a consultant like a business consultant at Deo or Mackenzie I thought you had to be insanely competent to land a role there I thought that being a consultant well the word consultant implies that you are Consulting somebody on how to do business business and probably after 20 or 25 years of proven success you are invited by a consulting company to do that work and then there is a customer who is willing to pay a lot of money for your experience and knowledge and your way of thinking that you're now allowed to consult a massive business on how to grow or how to transform yeah that was until I had a chance to spend more people from the Consulting World working at those top five Consulting firms and my perception of this job just shattered so anyway back to the topic I am so excited about the rise of career paths for individual contributors roles such as principal PM in my case but it could be any other job principal level staff level group level directors senior directors VPS without direct reports they're going to be making just as much as our counterparts who have reports except their focus will be on the competency and the experience in their specific field rather than people management this is still very rare but we are going to be seeing the rise of individual contributor roles in the next 5 years and I'm very excited for people including myself who want to build competence in their specific field rather than working on the people management skills because this gives me a lot of Hope for the future companies are starting to create dedicated career paths for individual contributors allowing them to progress and to be rewarded for their Tech technical expertise without necessarily moving into management this trend recognizes the value of deep subject expertise remember the skill shortages we talked about earlier and encourages retention of top talent we're going to start seeing the creation of co-director roles where one director focuses on people management responsibilities such as performance reviews vacation discussion compensation so on and so forth and the other director guides you within the area that you specialize in now let's talk about Ai and Bots versus people employers are embracing the idea that II tools can increase fairness in their workplace and highlight the contributions that people managers could miss in a more traditional performance management managers will still finalize the final decisions as the human in the loop validating and verifying the bot's recommendations but for more everyday activities such as in the- moment performance review Bots are likely to take on an increasing share of manager tasks especially for work that is digitally based I expect that going forward we will be seeing increased use of AI in scheduling feedback performance reviews and promotion and hiring decisions a June 2024 Gardener survey suggested that more than 3,300 employees revealed that 57% believe that humans are way more biased than AI when it comes to making compensation decisions an October 2024 Gardener survey of nearly 3500 100 employees suggested that 87% of employees think that algorithm could give fairer feedback than their managers right now now what does this mean for you if you have those systems at work where your manager asks you to fill out your weekly summary every Friday what you've done what you've achieved things like that do it and be very diligent about it because that data points are going to be fed to AI agents that will be processing your feedback every single week and that is exactly what's going to be helping you in your next performance review and conversation about your bonus and compensation do not neglect those things I know this has been said many times that you should be documenting all of your achievements throughout the year so you can properly fill out documentation at the end of it but you should be doing it a lot more because a lot of that data will be processed not by your direct manager but by the AI tools that they're going to be putting to use and this leads me to my next Point what changes are we going to be seeing in Talent acquisition strategies going forward AI will be used a lot in identifying which resumés will make it through to the interview round I hope I don't have to explain to anybody that AI can detect AI please do not use Chad GPT or CLA blindly to write your resumés and where you simply copy and paste I feel like this is such an obvious thing and should go without saying but I personally have seen so many rumes last year that were written entirely by Chad from start to finish without changing a word AI tends to generalize AI tends to exaggerate AI isn't always accurate and the info needs to be reviewed and fact checked don't rely on it blindly to write a document that starts your entire relationship with a potential employer the labor market is going to be adapting to new realities there is a trend towards the hybrid work with 40% of employers supporting mixed Arrangements skill-based pay is gaining momentum particular particularly in high demand Fields like AI cyber security and data science the great Office return there's going to be a big shift toward hybrid work models with 40% of employers supporting the mixed model with fully remote work declined to 7% from 21% in 2024 companies will be requiring in office Presence at least 3 days a week companies requiring in office presence will increase to 53% compared to 37% last year many major companies are implementing stricter return to office policies in 2025 for example as you've probably heard Amazon is requiring a 5day in-office presence starting January 2025 marking a significant shift from their previous hybrid model AT&T is requiring all staff to work on site 5 days a week beginning January 2025 JP Morgan increase in office presence requirement to 3 days a week with senior leaders being on site five days a week this trend is not isolated to large companies KPMG survey from 2025 confirms that 83% of CEOs expect a full return to office within the next 3 years if your company is offering a fuller remote setup think twice before changing rules a lot of people got accustomed to being at home 5 days a week and if that is something that matters to you be careful when you look for a new job the majority of new rules require some degree of in office presence now onto the factors that are driving this shift collaboration and Innovation many Executives believe that in-person office culture Foster better collaboration and Innovation there is a growing concern about maintaining and strengthening corporate culture in a remote environment there are productivity concerns some leaders argue that in-office work leads to higher productivity and higher engagement across all teams although this remains a point of debate economic uncertainty in the times of economic instability companies prefer more direct oversight of their Workforce hybrid work is often seen as a compromise that offers flexibility while maintaining some in-person collaboration interestingly hybrid workers often report feeling more connected to their teams and their work compared to those who work exclusively in person or exclusively remote now those factors are being listed as drivers of this shift across multiple reports and frankly at this point I personally think that it doesn't even matter whether whether you agree or not with those factors I personally disagree with half of them but I don't think those opinions are going to be taken into consideration companies are rapidly shifting to a hybrid model and even the ones who have been remote for years are now asking employees to show up at least twice a week and the last trend is around Wellness Centric employment mental health and overall well-being continues to be a trend and it's going to be one of the central components of talent acquisition strategies organizations are developing comprehensive Wellness plans Beyond traditional health benefits so you will start seeing more budget allocated towards mental health days therapy and meditation this shift reflects a deeper understanding that top talent increasingly prioritizes organizations that demonstrate genuine commitment to employee well-being I hope this was helpful if there are any Trends I haven't mentioned please mention them below I'm happy to continue this conversation I am personally semi excited for what's about to happen in the next 5 years I've enjoyed the fullly remote setup for many years and personally I wouldn't say that it impacted my productivity but I am very curious to hear about what you guys think let me know in the comments till next time bye
