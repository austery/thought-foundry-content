[音樂]兩周前我給大家分析了中國失控的青年失業率在學歷貶值已經成為既定現實並且預計將會持續很長一段時間的情況下評論區連很多年輕人和家長都覺得很迷茫不知道未來的路要怎麼走他們都在問我普通人應該怎麼辦 I can't help you make a choice, but whether you go to college or not, I think more important is whether a person has the ability to solve problems and have some real practical knowledge and skills. And in this, I found that most people are not aware of the most basic but also very important financial knowledge. 比如,有人說今天給你10萬元,還是一年後給你11萬元,你應該怎麼選呢?更複雜一點的例子,比如說剛就在本月初,有一個美國人在加州中了彩票大獎,2億美元他有兩個選擇,一個是現在立刻就獲得9000萬美元的一次性獎金另一個選擇是把2億拆分成30年,每年支付一次,那30年下來可以獲得總計2億美元他應該怎麼選呢? In history, most of the winners will choose to receive a one-time prize of almost four times But is this choice really right? If you understand the basic concepts of financial knowledge in these issues Then it is very useful for you to consider many practical problems in real life 比如房貸應該選擇等額本息還是等額本金有錢的時候是否應該提前還款買車的時候應該一次性付款還是貸款租房的時候應該選擇租金低一些還是押金少一些等等其實這些問題都是有正確的分析和考量方式的但是從小到大我們的學校和社會從來不教這些大多數父母也不懂 那么今天就让我来给大家科普一些非常实用的金融指示比如金钱的实践价值什么是铁纤、机会成本、现值、未来价值以及如何对任何类型的投资进行正确的测算等等 These are the useful instructions that everyone needs in real time. It will be very helpful for you to buy a house, finance, start a business, change jobs, or even to negotiate with the person in charge when you find a job. Ok, so we are going to start with the most basic and most important concept of financial theory. That is the value of time. Time value of money. 其實這個概念說起來非常簡單就一句話今天的一塊錢比明天的一塊錢更有價值請注意這跟通貨膨脹沒有關係通脹和通縮會改變金錢的購買能力跟金錢的時間價值不是同一個概念今天的一塊錢比未來的一塊錢更有價值完全只是因為你的錢能夠賺取利息 You may think it's nothing Even if you don't understand the principle It's also the same in the sense But we think this point is clear It helps us to understand the following A series of financial principles At this time, we need to understand The other two important concepts of direct links with money Limit and future value 假设说今天你朋友找你投资一个项目这个项目今天你投资100万元一年后可以取回120万元那么明年的这120万元即为今天你这个100万元的未来价值future value 所以未來價值是現在的金錢在未來某一個時間點的價值好 那麼現在我們反過來看這個問題如果你確定你會在一年後收到一百萬元那麼這比未來的錢在今天的價值是什麼還記得嗎金錢是有時間價值的既然今天的一塊錢比明天的一塊錢更有價值那麼一年後的一百萬元在今天其實並不值一百萬元 To understand this, you just need to think about it. If someone gives you a promise letter from the Central Bank, this promise letter says that you will take this letter to the central bank a year later. The central bank will give you 1 million yuan. So, would you like to use 1 million yuan to buy this promise letter today? You probably won't. Even if the central bank's promise is 100% true. 其實這張承諾函就是你可能聽說過的銀行的成對匯票那麼問題就是你應該用多少錢來購買這張成對匯票呢?或者說這張成對匯票在今天應該值多少錢呢?這時我們就可以用市場上的基準利率來作為一個衡量標準基準利率就是如果你把錢放到銀行裡你能夠保證獲得的年化利息 為了方便大家理解和計算今天我假設市場基準率率為5%目前在大部分國家實際上當然比這個低基準率率5%就是說如果你今天把100萬存進銀行一年後你會獲得5萬元利息再加上100萬的本金總共105萬元在這種情況下上面這張一年後價值100萬元的成對會票今天的價值是這麼計算的 一年後的100萬等於現在的100萬除以1.05等於95.2萬元以上這個公式換句話來說就是如果今天你把95.2萬元放到銀行裡那麼一年後這95萬2000元就會變成100萬元 Therefore, in the market with a 5% rate of accuracy, the value of the 10 million yuan after a year is only 95.2 million yuan at present. So if your friend is willing to sell you this team ticket for a price lower than 95.2 million yuan, you should buy it. If it is higher than 95.2 million yuan, you shouldn't buy it. 因為如果高於95.2萬元你自己把95.2萬元存進銀行裡一年後你也能獲得100萬元你又何必去買這張成對會票呢?好,講到這裡你就大概明白了金錢的現值和未來價值的概念 Let's continue In this example If you use 95.2 million to buy this one year later you will get a 100 million dollar deposit 5% of the total is the so-called "discount rate" discount rate. 貼線的意思就是把未來的現金轉換為今天等值的金額在一個完美市場裡這個貼線率其實就是你的機會成本Opportunity Cost不要忘記如果不購買這張會票或者說不投資這個項目你能夠將你手上的錢投資在其他的項目上在這個市場當中其他的項目收益越高你的機會成本就越高這張成對會票的現值就越低 比如說,現在有人告訴你,另一個可以讓你今天投資95.2萬元,一年後給你110萬元的項目。那麼這張成對會票對你而言的機會成本,就從原本的5%變成了15.5%。因為95.2萬元一年後變成110萬元,淨收益率為15.5%。 所以如果你有另一個無風險預計收益為15.5%的其他投資集會時這張成對會票的限值對你而言就變成了一年後的100萬等於現在的100萬除以1.155只有86.6萬元了只有當你朋友願意將這張成對會票以低於86.6萬元的價格賣給你你才能夠接受 Before I continue, some people may say But you didn't consider the risk, the change in the rate, etc. It's like this Just like when we are discussing the theory of chemistry and physics We will assume that these experiments are conducted in an ideal environment For example, a specific temperature No other external force or vacuum under the state etc. 而金融学也是一种科学所以同样的当我们在讨论这些金融理论的时候也要假设一个理想环境而金融学的理想环境就是假设没有税收没有加益成本没有风险没有通货膨胀交易者之间没有信息差并且阶段性利率不产生变化金融学里的这个理想环境被称为完美市场Perfect market This assumption is reasonable Just like Newton's law of law can only be perfected when there is no friction Only in a clean and controlled framework and basis can we understand the most fundamental principles of any scientific theory 這個視頻前面會稍微枯燥一些後面我們將理論套用到實際案例當中時就會越來越有趣了大家堅持一下好 那我們繼續現在我們把情況變得稍微複雜一些 Suppose someone tells you an investment project 1 year later, you will have a cash of 1 million yuan 5 years later, you will have another cash of 800,000 yuan In the case where the market standard interest rate is 5% You need to decide How much money do you need to invest in this investment project today? Is it worth investing? From the theory you just learned, you know how much you need to calculate the current value of this project. But you can't add 1 million after a year to the 800,000 after 5 years. And then say the value of this project is 1.8 million yuan. Because in fact, the unit of 1 million after a year is different from the 800,000 after 5 years. Adding these two numbers is as ridiculous as adding 100 kg and 80 cm. So we need to convert these two future values into the present value which is to turn them into the same unit so that we can add the value of the two same units How should we calculate it? Suppose the current market standard is 5% Then the value of 1 million today after a year is 1 million divided by 1.05 equals 95.2 million The value of the 800,000 in 5 years is 800,000 divided by 1.05 times 5 is equal to 627,000 Add these two lines together, it is equal to 157.9 million yuan In other words, the value of this investment project today is 157.9 million yuan At this time, you will know where the bottom line of your investment project is If the market standard rate is 5%, if the capital you need to invest is less than 157.9 million yuan, then this is a project worth investing in. If it is higher than 157.9 million yuan, then you should not invest. When you are doing similar calculations in real life, if you don't want to refer to the bank's standard rate, then you have to use the most secure investment channel you can get and the income it can bring you as a standard. I hope you understand the reason why I said this. When we look at the profit of a project, we can't just look at the absolute value, but we need to convert the future profit into the current value. Only then can we know the real opportunity cost. Ok, we've talked about a bunch of theories Now let's take a very close example of real life so that everyone can understand this concept more clearly Suppose you can't find a job now So your parents agree to let you buy a car and then go to do online dating So suppose you get to know some experienced people The profit of investing in a car to do online dating is like this You need to pay 500,000 RMB to buy a car To make it easier for you to understand I assume that I used some simple and easy to understand numbers You don't have to worry about the degree of match between these numbers and reality First, buy a car for 500,000 RMB Then in the next five years, the income of your online contract car every year deduct all costs, oil, electricity, insurance, maintenance, etc. Your annual income is 100,000 RMB At the end of the fifth year, you don't do it At this time, your car can still sell for 90,000 RMB We have listed it very clearly on this table At first, the car cost 500,000 RMB So it is a negative number The cash flow in the next 5 years Including the 90,000 RMB that the car sold in the fifth year So may I ask Should you do this? Or simply put What is your income rate for doing this? Suppose your goal is to have at least 5% annual income every year Should you do this? 这里就有高中低三个段位的答案了先从低段位开始对金融完全不理解只懂基本数学的人会说这简单我花了50万买车后面开车赚了50万卖车收回9万那么总共收回59万59万减去50万我净赚9万9万除以50万我的收益率是18%还不错啊银行理财现在一年才三个点这事儿可以干 The middle class will say You fool 18% is 5 years of income You have to pay 5% So the average annual income is only 3.6% It's about the same as the financial Fools do this At this time, because you have watched the video of Lao Zhou You will say that it is already high class wrong The next 5 years of 100,000 are not today's 100,000 We need to look at their limit To add them up The calculation method for each year's limit is like this The first year is 100,000/1.05 The second year is 100,000/1.05 So on and so forth Then add all the limits of these 5 years At this time you will find that this process is quite complicated And we need to predict the market profit rate for the next 5 years. Maybe the third year, the bank will increase the base rate to 8% Maybe the fifth year, the bank will reduce the base rate to 2% So here we have to learn another new concept That is Internal Return Rate Internal Rate of Return In short IRR IRR is a very useful thing This is a tool that can convert all cash flows into cash and tell us a formula for real return rate IRR formula is actually very complicated looks like this But don't worry We don't have to deal with its principle for now Because the great Excel provides a simple formula so that we can directly calculate IRR Now let's look back at the example of this online car project We just talked about the middle section The annual return rate of this project is 90,000 profit divided by 500,000 capital Get a total revenue of 18% Then divided by 5 years Equivalent to 3.6% annual income Right? But if you already know the value of the time You should know that The annual income rate of this project should be higher than 3.6% Why? Because the middle-level calculation is equivalent to saying You spent 500,000 in the first year Then you only spent 590,000 in the fifth year But the reality is not like this The reality is that you are returning 100,000 yuan every year The first 100,000 yuan is worth more than the second 100,000 yuan The second 100,000 yuan is worth more than the third 100,000 yuan So it is a push back These are all middle-level algorithms that are not considered Why is the first year's 100,000 RMB worth more than the previous year? Because after you receive the first year's 100,000 RMB You can invest again Or you can put it in the bank to make interest When this project ends at the end of the fifth year This 100,000 RMB has already earned 4 years of interest And the 100,000 RMB received in the second year It has earned 3 years of interest when the project ends So it's a bit of a drag Most people don't consider this when they do simple calculation for project income So I say this is just a middle-level calculation The return on the internal currency rate IRR is a way to calculate the time node that flows in and flows out of the cash Let's practice In Excel, when we calculate the cash flow in these 5 years through IR2 formula In fact, the real profit rate of this project is 5.2% which is 3.6% higher than the simple algorithm In order to make you understand more about the importance of cash flow and how to flow out the time points We made some small adjustments to this project and called it "Plan 2" Suppose you drive very hard the first two years Then you start to be lazy So the first two years you can have 200,000 in income every year The third and fourth years you can only have 500,000 The fifth year you just lay flat Zero income So in fact, the total income you have in the fifth year is the same Still 500,000 The money of selling cars does not change So the total income of project 2 and project 1 are also 500,000 So according to the simple calculation of the middle level The total income and annual income are completely unchanged Still a 5.9 million profit So the annual income is still 3.6% But you now understand very well This is not possible to be correct Because you have received 200,000 back in the first year You can put this 200,000 into the bank to earn 4 years of interest How can it be the same as the original plan 1 that received 100,000 back every year? We use IR2 to test again You will find that IR2 of FAN2 has already increased by 7.5% The trap flow that hit the head made FAN2 a very good project I use the online car as an example But in real life, you will encounter many similar situations is that different periods of time will produce different amount of cash flow. You can't just focus on the amount of cash you earn, you also have to consider the time period of cash flow. And the most straightforward way to understand the actual income of a project is through the return on the internal currency. 我们再看回上面这个滴滴的案例假设现在有人说我再给你另一个选择这个选择跟方案2一样唯一的区别就是第三和第四年收益更少了都只有4万元那么这样下来这个项目的总收益少了2万变成只有57万了 Now I ask you The latest plan 3 and the first plan 1 Which is the first to fifth year The plan that earns 100,000 a year Which one do you want to choose? For many people You are joking Plan 1 total income is 590,000 Your plan 3 total income is only 570,000 You don't have to think about it at all It must be plan 1 但这个选择其实是错误的我们用R2来一测算就知道了方案1的R2是5.2%但方案3的R2其实是5.9%方案3才是正确的选择 Why is the plan 3 less than 20,000 but has higher return on the internal market? Because this plan is very important The money collected in the early stage played the role of time value of money Of course, I say all these is that you have to continue to invest the money you collected If you hide the money under the bed then IRR is not suitable for you After understanding this financial concept In fact, you can use it in many situations in life For example, when you rent a house Don't just stare at the rent In fact, the deposit for several months should also be part of your consideration Many people may think that the deposit will be returned in the end So no matter how much the deposit is In fact, the income of the landlord is the same So on the same basis It must be low rent But in fact, not necessarily If one of the solutions is that the rent is lower but requires a few more months of deposit then compared to the rent is slightly higher but the deposit requirement is much less it may be a worse choice For example, I often hear someone say I've been in prison for 10 years Today I finally wait for the stock price to return to my purchase price I finally solved it But this is still a wrong concept Suppose you bought this stock with 100,000 yuan 10 years ago Today the stock price is back to its original position You sell it and take back 100,000 yuan You think it's back to normal But the 100,000 yuan 10 years ago Can't compare with today's 100,000 yuan Suppose the average average rate of the market in the past 10 years is 3% 100,000 yuan 10 years ago is worth 134,392 yuan today So strictly speaking, your stock will have to increase by 34% to be considered as a real solution Since we are talking about stocks I will also make an exception to make a common mistake If you buy a stock today the stock price will immediately drop by 30% May I ask how many percentage points this stock needs to increase before you can return it Give you 3 seconds If you say, do you still need to ask? Of course it's 30% But this is wrong In fact, the answer is 42.3% For example, if today's BIA's stock price is 100 yuan After you buy in, the stock price immediately fell by 30% It becomes 70 yuan You instinctively think that the stock price will go up 30% and then go back to the original price But a 70 yuan stock goes up 30% Actually only 91 yuan You haven't gone back to the original price So any stock that has fallen by 30% Actually needs to go back to 42.86% You can count it as a return Because the number of funds has become smaller So the stock that has fallen needs to go back to the original price The difficulty is more difficult than your instinctive feelings Here I made a table for you You can see clearly After the share price fell by a certain percentage How much will it take to return the stock? You can only return the stock You can make a balance as a survey table in the future No need to write Don't forget The so-called return in this table Just absolutely worth the return And didn't consider the value of the money You should have understood by now You should consider how long you spent to return the book The most accurate answer is to add the limit calculation Alright, if you see this and fully understand everything I said Then I dare to say that you are more understanding of the basic concept of finance than 90% of people in the world I will talk about the last practical case, then we can end I thought the part is quite long But I believe this is an example that can prevent many people from stepping on the pit Suppose you start a business or buy a car today and need to pay 100,000 yuan A relative or a small loan company told you that It can provide you with a 5% loan in annual interest You may think that 5% is not high It is a little more than the bank It is totally acceptable But you wait a minute Let's take a look at its actual terms and terms of interest See if there is a trap The loan plan is like this The loan is 100,000 yuan, and the monthly payment is 2 years' pay. The annual interest is 5%. The monthly payment amount is calculated as follows. First, calculate the annual interest. 100,000 yuan multiplied by 5 is equal to 5,000 yuan. So, 2 years is a total of 10,000 yuan interest. So, the capital 100,000 plus 10,000 interest is 11,000 yuan in total. The monthly payment is 4,583.33 yuan divided by 24 months. What do you think of this plan? If you think it's reasonable, then you have to watch my video again and again until you understand it completely. The real interest of this plan is not 5% because of the 4583.33 yuan monthly payment which includes 4166.57 yuan of capital and 416.67 yuan of interest. 那麼你想想了你每個月都在還本金但是你這筆貸款的利息卻是按照十萬的本金足額計算了兩年的正確的算法是每個月你還掉本金之後再重新用剩餘本金來計算利息 How much interest did you actually pay for the plan given by others? We can calculate the plan in Excel using IRR This table is for beginners Its profit is the interest you pay So at the beginning, he borrowed 100,000 yuan Then the next 24 months, the monthly income is 4583.33 yuan Enter the IRR formula of Excel The answer is 9.3% This is the interest you really pay Almost 5% of 2 times If you are a regular bank loaner They won't use this method to give you interest This method usually only occurs in Confederation of平息計算法來進行免責但如果銷售員是比較狡猾的他們是不會特地告訴你這一點的 The way to calculate interest in big bank is called "Water-Bank Test" There are also different methods of "Equal Funding" and "Equal Funding" and "Same Funding" But today's content is too much for many people So I think these topics will be left until the next episode This video is a new attempt It is a pure financial textbook without political colors So if the flow and reflection of this video are particularly good Then I will often insert this kind of video Can provide everyone with help You can also not have to let people feel heavy after watching every episode So if you like this video Be sure to like and share to your family and friends I am Lao Zhou, cold and beautiful, I will not be able to speak See you next time
