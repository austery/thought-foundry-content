Hi everyone. Uh, welcome to today's special podcast. I'm super honored to have Professor Everan Abamean joining my podcast. Professor, thank you for doing this with me.
>> Thank you very much, Fig.
>> Yeah. So, last time we had a podcast kind of discussing the influence of the 1953 coup on the current Iran Iranian political system. Um, actually, as you know, it probably follows the news, the current situation is pretty bleak. like you have all the protests on the street. I heard some uh protester got killed by the current regime and there's definitely a huge crackdown on that. Um can you just briefly tell us like what's your perspective on the current situation going on in Iran?
>> Well underlying problem for this regime is that it was it came to power in 79 a great deal of popularity. So it had a lot of legitimacy. It was probably the most popular revolution that's occurred in world history.
>> Mhm.
>> Since then, the regime has narrowed its base uh by being more and more sectarian. So,
>> it's cut away, you know, Islamic reformists, radicals, uh even people from within the regime if they didn't quite follow the supreme leaders line, they were marginalized. So it has lost its uh you could say its legitimacy not totally but it's from I would say from 80% support which it originally had it's probably narrowed down to 15%.
>> Um so the the underlying is the problem of legitimacy but of course on top of that what is the sparked off the present problem is the sanctions.
>> Mhm. the incredible sanctions that have been on for a long time and basically they ruined the economy.
>> Yeah.
>> Um so often it's seen the question often is you know if Iran moderated its policy or it beh somehow the sanctions would be lifted and things would be improved. So it's often the question the onus is put on the Iranian government. I mean it's a despicable government. There's no question that but whether the real driver of the car or the policy is really Iran or outside powers issue.
>> Yeah. So I think the real problems are really in Washington and Tel Aviv where they are the ones who've imposed these economic uh incredible sanctions. Uh I don't think any other country suffered the similar sanctions. Uh but then the question arises uh what is their motivation? What they want?
>> Yeah.
>> Uh and there you know that's fuzzy. I you know a lot of liberals in America think well it's uh pressure so that Iran will behave better on the nuclear issue.
>> Yeah.
>> But but Iran did actually sign a very good agreement with Obama
>> JCPOA. Yeah. Exactly.
>> So I'm not that's not I don't think the issue. Then the question becomes uh the vowed reason the Americans give is they want regime change. Uh but what does that mean?
>> Yeah.
>> Usually when you talk about the term regime change is a euphemism for what used to be used as coup d'etat a military coup that's fallen out of fashion. It's considered sort of too imperialistic. So that was coined u uh regime change. Uh but to have a regime change, you need to have an alternative to the regime to be able to take over.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh and I I don't see that there. Uh basically you have mass demonstrations, a lot of people there protesting, but there is no organization, no even informal system that you can claim uh is going to be an alternative government.
>> Yeah,
>> I think people uh not necessarily in Washington but in Tel Aviv were quite aware of that. So I don't think they're deluding themselves into thinking that there's going to be a regime change.
>> So the question then becomes what is their agenda? And I fear their agenda is basically dismantling of the regime uh breakdown of the whole state as they did with other countries.
>> Yeah. Like Libya, right? Or like Iraq.
>> Iraq. Libya basically Syria too, Yugoslavia.
>> Um that's been very much a policy of of of foreign sort of I would say still imperial powers uh is if you can't control a state uh but way ways to deal with it is to dismantle it.
>> Yeah. I think many of my listeners are familiar with the 1953 coup against the Mozc. I think you write a very famous book. I'm going to put the link in the description of this podcast as well. So looking back um was that 1979 Islamic revolution essentially a reaction to that event? I think your answer is pretty definitively yes, right?
>> Yeah, it's not a direct, you know, 53 to 79. It's not that simple,
>> but I would say the origins of the 79 revolution go back to 53. Mhm.
>> Because what happened was here you had a national uh hero basically hero Mosad who was not only seen as a national figure head uh epitomizing uh Iranian nationalism in oil nationalization but he was also actually a a child of the uh constitutional revolution earlier in the century.
>> Yeah. So in many ways he had a sort of uh charismatic power uh and his overthrow by the CIA MI6 uh really uh not only destroyed Mosad but it brought to power uh the sha who from the beginning lacked legitimacy.
>> Exactly. And the sha actually is often portrayed as sort of a hamletike figure who didn't know what he was doing. But in fact, if you go back to the documents before the 53 coup, he's quite uh perceptive. He keeps on telling the British and the Americans that if I go against mosat, an oil nationalization, I will lose uh legitimacy. not just self the whole monarchy will lose legitimacy. So he knew that if he basically participated in the coup he would be undermining his own authority.
>> Yeah.
>> So he knew that from 53 on from the beginning.
>> Yeah. So what he often did after 53 and there's a long gap of obviously 537 he was always trying to gain uh legitimacy
>> support right
>> and one way I mean continually the first uh 10 years was to have uh at those days was called modernization
>> socioeconomic re uh reform and here it was Actually uh Walt Rasttow you know the uh the theorist of modernization
>> argued that the way to prevent revolutions is to have socioeconomic modernization.
>> Exactly.
>> And he did that. But what that did was actually it expanded the two major classes that had always opposed the monarchy. That was the intelligencia, the modern middle class and the industrial working class.
>> So that he was in a way socially undermining the monarchy by modernization.
>> Yeah.
>> Another thing he did was part of that was then have the so-called white revolution.
>> Yeah.
>> Where he could argue that you know Mosc didn't carry out land reform. I'm carrying out major land reform. I'm a revolutionary. And if ever took the language of dialectics that he was a dialectical relationship with his people, he transformed the white revolution and the sha's people's revolution. This was a way of actually further getting some sort of legitimacy.
>> Yeah. What it did was actually again undermined him because in the old regime the old uh feudal class uh the landlords the tribal chiefs had been the backbone of the monarchy.
>> Yeah. uh and land reform in fact destroyed that class.
>> And it was supposed to create a small landed uh farming class that would support the regime.
>> Yeah.
>> But that there it failed initially that was the idea of it of the white revolution. I'm just curious why I mean if you look at the communist movement like in uh Soviet Union or China or other like similar communist country like I think the policy he adopt is very similar to those like they they take down all the far like landlords and uh uh those uh people who have the land and then distribute those land to the farmer who hasn't and that should be a popular policy towards those uh lower income class right
>> if it's done properly It's would succeed I mean it succeeded in Japan back then uh a number of other countries but in Iran it didn't succeed because they never followed it up because it's not enough just giving a farmer's land you need support system you need basically uh uh help for agriculture and they after a while in fact the sha felt so confident that they transferred from farm families to encouraging uh agro businesses, plantations.
>> Uh so they started actually dispossessing a lot of far small farmers in favor of agro businesses. So
>> they failed to create a social base in the countryside. Another way the sha tried to get legitimacy was this idea of imperial monarchy that he was a a grand emperor uh in the line of 2500 years of history.
>> Yeah. going to pre-Islamic uh Iran uh the procep celebrations of 2500 years and that further undermined the system because one thing it did is it it's it seemed for the clergy like an attack on religion
>> because going back to pre-Islamic Iran as core of Iran and that was seen as a way of trying to undermine uh people's faith.
>> Uh but also I mean part of the imperial ambitions was spending a lot of money on on arms. The sha was the biggest buyer of American arms.
>> Yeah.
>> For many people this was waste of money but it was also proof to people that the shop was actually put in power to serve American interests.
>> I see. to you remember there's a time after Vietnam Nixon created what was known as the Nixon doctrine.
>> Mhm.
>> And Nixon basically was saying we can't we don't have the money to police the world. We need local policemen, local Jean Darmms.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> And the sha quickly appointed himself as a local John Darm for America in the Gulf region.
>> Yeah. So for many people in Iran, this was direct proof that yes, he is a stoogge of the United States. Uh otherwise why is he wasting all this money we need for social programs on on ultra ultraodern weaponry from United States.
>> Mhm.
>> So all these things further undermined his legitimacy. So when you came to actually set the crisis in 7879 uh he had no uh social support.
>> Yeah. And often actually with the reports uh CIA reports state department they say well you know he has a has done so many things to actually um make himself unpopular inflation let's say uh torture those all things that were true but the real reason was that it had lacked legitimacy. Yeah, obviously the Americans couldn't admit to themselves that in fact the wrote root cause of the problem was at 53.
>> Yeah. Uh someone compared the Islamic Republic to a betrayed revolution that happened in 1979, right? Like similar to like historical analogies when a monarchy is overthrown only to be replaced by a different form of a authoritarian regime. Is this current crashes a direct consequence of the removal of the secular democratic options like Mosedc in decades ago because basically they destroyed that benign democratic option even that class completely during that crackdown era.
>> Yeah. Also I mean there's a feeling that people were take taken for a ride.
>> Mhm. Because if you uh read many uh press conferences, he gave a lot in France before the in the eve of the revolution. It was always basically that, you know, we're offering freedom everyone. The sha is a dictator. We'll be exactly opposite. He even said, you know, I'm an old man. I'm just hope to after the revolution go back to my uh studies at seminary. the image given to the public
>> uh was that it was going to be the monarchy will be replaced by a democratic republic.
>> Yeah. Now the thinking the real thinking of Hmeni was in fact a clerical state and he he had written a uh a given a series of lectures on what was calledatafaki which means literally the authority of the clergy.
>> Mhm.
>> Never mentioned that in during the revolution.
>> Yeah.
>> It was under this book was published under a pseudo name.
>> Uhhuh. There was a quite actually sort of Mcavelian strategy to saying well no no this wasn't really his work u this was someone else had written it or that you know these are student notes of lectures he gave in Iraq and you know everyone knows that student lecture notes are not reliable.
>> Yeah. Exactly. So but there was no actually open admittance that this was his thinking.
>> Mhm.
>> After the revolution once the sha was gone completely was in power then they revealed the notion of clerical power. So they transformed the idea of a democratic republic to a clerical republic and the constitution was it's a very complex document some 160 clauses but what it does is it's institutionalize the power of the clergy.
>> Yeah. So you I think that what therefore people felt was they were hoodwigged into something that they were not actually demonstrating for and they got and ended up with something that was unpalatable. So that that that as a another cause of the the regime. Now, if the regime had been willing to open up
>> and have a more liberal interpretation of their own constitution, it would have been more actually viable, but it's over the years it's got narrower and narrower.
>> Yeah. I I read your book uh describing that part of the history and my impression is homminy is very good at propaganda. So, he say one thing and a lot of people support him. even the the democratic ones, the liberal ones, they they form a huge alliance kind of supporting him to pass that um constitution and after that he started all kinds of activity cracking down each part and eventually step by step all the other democratic options has been destroyed. So right now in Iran like there's no such thing as alliance like Mozc was having during the 50s right. So right now you don't see any kind of u liberal organizations uh existing in Iran.
>> No, I mean it's the even civil organizations are very basic.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh the only thing people who could organize is the government work within government organizations
>> and that's why the protests basically are in the street.
>> Yeah. Exactly. So in your view as a historian like what do you think is a primary factor that determine the destiny of a nation like Iran? Is it like deeply rooted history, culture, ideology, the political system or the personality of the supreme leader and a lot of like accidental factors that kind of cause into the current state? Well, I I mean all of them all basically are a factor
>> but in this case actually I mean in this case the crisis is basically uh externally basically
>> introduced right yeah
>> Israel and also the the basically the sanctions
>> if there weren't sanctions I think there would be much more ability for uh the regime to open up
>> um And of course, one argument is often made is if there is more economic development, prosperity, the the middle class would be be better off. And the once the middle class is better off, they would have more power within the state. and you would have actually more of a of a you could say u regime that even if it's clerical this is able to uh deal with with a United States and other countries.
>> So the sanctions basically make the system more intransigent than then open up.
>> Got it. So the Islamic Republic is actually a unique hybrid of the clerical rules and the limited democratic element. You know like Iran has elections, they have the reformist uh president. However, the recent protest seem to have crossed a threshold. You know like the traditional merchants which is like a key pillar of the 1979 revolution join in to protest the current existing regime. So do you think this signal a fundamental secular shift in the Iranian civil society that the current system can no longer accommodate?
>> Um yes I mean the the fact that the economy is so bad it is affecting even people who have political influence like the bazaar uh is showing that there's is a really serious serious crisis there. Mhm.
>> But the question is, you know, for the regime, what to do? And that's where their alternatives are actually limited because the people basically making the crisis are not in Iran. There's not the it's not the regime. It's basically in Washington and Tali.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So basically it hand is actually tied. There's not much they can do like unless the sanctions somehow like got lifted.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. And I don't see that happening. So
>> the the crisis is going to go on. I think u if the on one hand if the regime doesn't collapse the crisis will be there. If the regime collapses there'll be even a worse crisis in that chaos in the country.
>> I know. So uh do you think like the merchants finally turn against the regime due to this hyperinflation happening in Iran? Do you think the regime currently have any sociological base left beyond the military? You know, like obviously they control the military.
>> Well, I mean there might be actually the the discontent or protests in the bazaar could be just a temporary thing because
>> for businessmen and shopkeepers, the last thing you want is people burning your shops or your establishments. Uh so if they see the chaos happening, they might even uh again go back rally around the regime.
>> Yeah, I see what you're saying. Um so I think like the current Iran president looks like trapped because he promised to listen to the people while the judiciary prepared to do mass trials for those enemies on the street. They think those guys are like foreign infiltrated spies try to overthrow the government. Historically the Islamic Republic uses a reformist president you know as a safety vow to release those social pressure. Um do you think this safety vow mechanism finally broke in 2026 because apparently the president is kind of losing the grips of the current uh protest. Yeah, I mean this has happened before too. You know was reformist Rouan in some way was uh even uh going back earlier Raf Sanjani the first president after once actually died uh they were more I would say open-minded but it they were always stifled by the clerical hierarchy. Mhm.
>> Yeah.
>> So, this isn't new. Uh I think what could happen is uh Peshan the president is still president. uh but he can still uh in a way restrain the clergy and leave it opening so that you know people who don't want to actually chaos they don't want overthrow might still find someone like Peshkan as a reasonable someone from the establishment
>> uh to find a way to get out of the crisis.
>> Yeah. So I think like the 2025 protest was triggered by the econom economic collapse, right? But the revolutionary guards like the IRGC's they actually control a massive portion of the economy. So do you think in your view like the Islamic Republic actually transformed from a theocari into a military mafia conglomerate? Basically you have the army and the revolutionary guard control all the different sectors of the of the important businesses. In fact, to some extent, they're actually the the past stars, the revolution guards, uh have less economic control right now than they did about 10 years ago.
>> Oh, really? uh in in some ways the governments has tried and especially I think any reformist uh president will will has in the past and will try to res limit uh the uh revolution guard's economic activities um I mean the the model they follow followed that was actually China after Mao
>> that you know the red army had a lot of influence in the economy.
>> Exactly.
>> After a while they the government discouraged that and tried it to make it more pro uh private or stayed private. Uh that could happen in in Iran.
>> So I think you have uh written extensively about the reality of the Palv era right and also the 1953 coup. Today however we see on internet right like a generation of the young Iranians chanting the return of the monarchy and uh Raza Palvi as a historian do you view this as a genering political support for a monarchy or this is just an act of desperation because like they haven't been through that horrible horrible era in the Iranian history.
>> Well I don't know how widespread it is. You know with internet you have one you can have one picture of a guy saying you know uh Pav's return or something projected as if this was the the popular cry it's not like in 1978 where you had actually 3 million people in the street
>> exactly
>> pulling for so if that happens yes I would say that's serious but I think that an incident here or there it doesn't prove that. Um what what has happened in the last 20 years is in the diaspora. There's been a lot of funny money coming into uh quite actually sophisticated uh media especially movies
>> very systematically creating nostalgia for the path period.
>> Yeah. So they're his movies, films, documentaries and even you know it's very simplist every time you have an image of the opi era you have nice soothing music.
>> Exactly. Yeah.
>> Whenever it's you have a from the Islamic Republic on pleasant. So the mood is to is to create a a mythical past as if it was everything was fine. Yeah.
>> And people forget that actually 7879 there were literally 3 million people in the street calling for the end of the pav. So
>> yeah,
>> it's a systematic I artificial creation.
>> Yeah.
>> And funny money originally I think came from uh Saudi Arabia.
>> Mhm.
>> But the Saudis are no longer interested in that. So I think the funny money probably comes from Israel. Yeah. Do you think like uh I know Palavi uh in his regime uh Israel um Mosad and CIA they trained the secretly uh secret uh police force in the country, right? Help him to uh find all the protesters and really punish those who want to overthrow the regime or protest in the street. Right. So do you think that Israel and uh maybe the United States they want to have that good old days coming back to Iran basically put the this kind of res back in Iran taking control become a puppet state
>> I you know they might wish that but I think there's at least that the Israeli uh intelligence MOSAD I think is aware that that's a mirage that's not likely to happen so
>> however much that they talk about return of the Palavis. They know that's not in the books.
>> Yeah. I I saw I saw like u um Razar Palvi went on the show and then give a speech to uh Iranian people and acting like he's going to be the next in line to take control of the regime. Do you think he's out of his mind or like he seriously think that's possible? He has the support of the western countries. Well, I think he it pro it he does pro think that you know the card is in America's hand and Israel has he if he basically does says what they want they will put him back into power but the question is how
>> you know there as I was saying there's no institution or structure uh or party in Iran that is going to invite the sha back to become sha
>> so The only way he can be returned to Iran as Sha is a massive army occupying the country and putting him back in power. I mean, in the past whenever you've had a monarchy restored, it's often been uh through foreign occupation.
>> Yeah. That means like US have to put the troops on the ground like to really occupy Iran for probably decades to have a stable uh monarchy in place.
>> Yeah. And you know that didn't work actually in in in Iraq.
>> Iraq and end up horribly. So I don't think that there will be any Americans supporting that like right now at least from my perspective.
>> Yeah. I mean I I mean I can't see us uh having the will or even the ability to mobilize such a army. It would need to be actually a a not a unilateral army but a multinational army.
>> Yeah.
>> If you go back in history uh after Napoleon it's true the Borborns were returned to France. Mhm.
>> But to return the bourbons in France, you needed the Tsarist army, the British army, the Prussian army, the Austrian army. So you need a massive, you know, alliance of countries to occupy the country to bring back monarchy and that's not in the books in Iran.
>> Yeah. So the current regime is attributing the violence on the street to foreign agents like MSAD and like infiltrators kind of entering from the border. You have written about the paranoia style in the Iranian politics because of the 1953 coup. Does the current leader actually think that um I don't know if that's your own theories or it's their know kind of deeply rooted in their mind. They think like every protest is kind of under the foreign direction which I think it's actually part of them is true because you do see Mike Pompeo went on the um a conference and saying that uh congrat to the Iranian people and also the Msad sitting next to them like on the street. I think that's partly true. But do you think it's uh it's also a cynical propaganda because like they try to not really face internal problems like they may have in governing the the country.
>> Well, I think both there there's clearly foreign involvement especially when uh guns have appeared.
>> Exactly. Yeah.
>> So there is that sus uh reason for suspicion but of course they're using it. I mean the sh used it too. He constantly was telling uh the American ambassador and the British ambassador that all these problems are caused by the Soviets.
>> Yeah. Exactly.
>> And they would say, "No, we have no evidence." Then he turned around and said, "Oh, it must be the CIA doing this."
>> Mhm.
>> Still the monarchists think that the Sha was overthrown because the Americans wanted him overthrown. So the the paranoia is mostly actually among the the royalists who have this notion that everything was fine. It was the Americans that overthrew the sha.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh and the sha actually himself often would say the reason he was getting uh trouble uh in the west about human rights was because of the Jewish press.
>> Yeah. So he if you were looking for someone who's really anti-semitic in Iran uh in the old regime it was the sha himself. He had this idea that somehow the the Jews controlled American press and that was
>> and he because he had said some statements about uh Palestinians which he never meant it because he always he never wanted a Palestinian state.
>> Yeah. But a few statements he'd made, he said, "Ah, that's what that's why the Jewish press is out to get me."
>> Yeah. So, how do you think about, you know, the current uh if you go on the social media YouTube um people on different sides both blame the other saying like, you know, the Iranian government is saying, "Oh, all this social unrest are actually foreign actors. They're like spies and MSAD or other like uh conspiracy theories. They want to overthrow the regime, they basically bring the weapons into the country, which is part of them is true, right? But the government think that calling those protest the the spies gave them the right to really um commit the massacre, right? Like killing a lot of people on the street.
>> However, the US, if you see President Trump, he's saying, "Oh, we need to stop the government kind of killing its own civilians. So, we are lock and loaded. were uh ready to attack Iran to save those protesters and both of them try to put themselves in a high moral high ground but actually from my opinion like none of them actually have that stand you know like it's a it's a very messy situation in Iran.
>> Well when when Trump says he's going to intervene to help the demonstrators I do not know what what the mechanism is.
>> Yeah.
>> How is it that going to happen? I mean last time there was the bombing Israelis bombed. They actually bombed the main political prison.
>> Yeah.
>> And the people who are there are actually people who criticize the regime. So I mean the only way intervention I can see is the US and Israel intervening to decapitate the regime.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh and then the decapitation of regime doesn't mean change of regime. it means then opening for complete anarchy and destruction of the state. So that's why I keep on going back to the I think the real agenda of uh both Israel and United States is disintegration of the state. Yeah, I kind of see uh there's many other geopolitical experts um believing the same argument you're making like basically the Israel government want the Iranian power to be a dysfunctional state, a rubber state. So basically you have the internal civil war unrest and never really be able to form a strong army and threaten Israel's position in the Middle East.
>> Yeah, I think that's the agenda. Yeah.
>> Yeah. I I think I think that makes sense as well. So, uh do you think um the current Iran regime would turn into something like a hermit kingdom, a fully closed security state similar to North Korea, you know, use a national internet to block out all the other website uh external to Iran and also kind of server the ties with the world and uh just maybe working doing business with China and Russia to to kind of maintain the stability of the regime. Do you think that's possible? Like the North Korean mode for Iran?
>> I don't think by choice they want to do that, but they might end up having to do that. Yes.
>> If there's no willingness on uh America's part to negotiate some sort of settlement,
>> uh they have no choice but to do that. Uh remember the original slogan of the revolution was neither east nor west. Yeah.
>> Um, but they've been forced basically uh to rely a lot on Russia and China. Uh, but those powers are not really willing to stick out their neck for Iran. So,
>> exactly.
>> They might have to do what North Korea did, which is basically become a hermit state.
>> Yeah. uh uh and of that was that's not going to solve the internal problems. Uh the difference of course I see is the North Korea has has the bomb and that
>> uh Iran doesn't have it.
>> Yeah. Uh and that's what some when people something think about a regime change if their regime change is the revolutionary guards taking over uh they might think much more in terms of North Korea and the only way they can survive as a hermit state is in fact having the bomb.
>> Yeah. So actually they this might accelerate the development of nuclear bomb instead of really slow it down.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Uh also I think the current supreme leader um ham is in a advancing age right like he's pretty old. Um we see the current of power you know you have the clergy and the revolution guards and also the civilian uh technocrats. Um in the inevitable power vacuum that follow the supreme leader left the world. Who do you predict will come out on top? Witnessing a slow transition from theocracy to a military dictatorship run by the IRGC.
>> Actually, the constitution was very savvy to make sure there'd be a sort of line of succession.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh and you know when Humeni died, the expectation was well he was such an informative person no one would replace him.
>> Yeah. In fact, the constitution is structured in such a way that there will be an easy transition to next. Uh
>> uh so there are a lot of basically clauses and how to do it and it could be uh either one person even someone who is not very well known uh could be elected as the supreme leader or you could have a council of religious figures taking over. So that's not a problem. Um, and I think the revolutionary guards need some sort of uh uh fig leaf.
>> Mhm.
>> Sort of basically form of legitimacy. It wouldn't be a great legitimacy, but it it is better than being purely naked force of the revolutionary guards. So it would be in their interest to have some sort of uh one uh cleric at the top or three clerics at the top who give them some sort of uh religious order.
>> Got it. Got it. So basically you could have um military dictatorship but they would not uh change the structure. They basically put some uh puppy in the top to kind of stabilize the country. Right.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. That's interesting. So many Iranians want change, right? But they look the border middle east and fear the regime chain could lead to chaos and even a worsen situation which happens a lot in the past when you have a revolution you often have a more authoritarian regime come into power than the previous one. So in the current political impass is inevitable due to you know Iran's geography and ethnic composition. Do you think that's like because of Iran unique position or um if the regime fails right is there any generating risk of the state collapse like uh what happened in Iraq or Syria or Libya like um adjacent countries?
>> Yes. I mean Iran has it great national identity
>> long identity. educational system has stressed the importance of national identity too for the last 50 years.
>> There is a strong sense of Iran uh Iraness
>> but important but there's also exists in certain areas of Iran an ethnic identity.
>> Mhm. So it's not only one national entity but also ethnic identity such as among the Kurds, the Baluchi, uh the Arabs and to some extent among Turkish speakers.
>> Mhm.
>> Large percentage of the population is Turkish speaking. Um so when you have a society that there looks so very unified because there's a sort of state national identity it's often forgotten that there is also simmering underneath it uh ethnic identities. When there's a crisis, it's easy for outside powers to actually only with a little bit of basically nudging create a much more ethnic divisions.
>> Yeah.
>> I mean, look at Yugoslavia for years. It under Tito it seemed like Yugoslavia was a viable state. Uh I traveled in Yugoslavia actually on the Tito and I was looking for this and you know everyone I talked to assured me you know sure in the past there had been ethnic differences between Serbians, Bosnians uh the Muslims, Croatians and so on. Uh and it it felt like there was a real viable uh Yuguslav nationality. Uh but after Tito died and things became a bit wobbly some European powers neighbors were actually very muching interested in dismantling
>> yeah and was easily to incite you know massacres whether between Serbians or Croatians or Muslims and that that became a horror story as a result of that.
>> Mhm.
>> So, uh I I wouldn't dismiss the possibility of of ethnic divisions.
>> Yeah. As you know, like the current political discourse often present a binary choice. You know, it's either the current uh clerical regime or the return of Palavy monarchy. Do you think there could be a third way for Iran like there could be a modernday mozzen Iran? Do you think that's possible?
>> Yeah. Yes. I mean, I think the sentiment in the street especially
>> is for actually some sort of I wouldn't say liberal but some sort of de democracy
>> and often the cries you see in the street liberty equality. the notion that people have rights and it's not the the state shouldn't tell you what to do or or not what to dress and so on.
>> And uh that doesn't mean people are anti-religious but they're feeling as um that religion is a private affair and what you believe in has nothing to do with the state.
>> Yeah. Yeah.
>> So I think that the culture the popular culture is very actually ready for some sort of democracy.
>> Uh the question is uh how can you transfer political authority of the state that likes to monopolize power to a much more open system.
>> Mhm. Uh so I it is possible I mean someone like Mosat could appear uh even someone from the regime who is open-minded enough to do that uh that's I think a good hope for for for the future. Yeah.
>> Yeah. So do you think even like say we have a regime change the clerical class um get out of the power right they're no longer the supreme leader in Iran society but that class still remains socially and economically powerful in the Iran society do you think Iran could be doomed to a cycle of revolution and restoration like over and over again basically they put mariki back and then there will be another uh revolution like 1979 happen again.
>> No, because I think the clergy uh the ones that are not actually in power, they would were quite happy to be basically distant from the state, not to have power. There they would still retain their social power, even economic power in terms of foundation, you know, endowments. um uh the church equivalent to churches here uh and many of them actually are not that happy having being associated with the state.
>> So the clergy are not necessarily uh eager to have control over the state. Uh so they're not the ones that are going to be actually uh counterrevolutionary if there was a democracy set up.
>> Yeah. So when President Trump come back to the white office for uh the second term, right, he's doing this uh maximum pressure campaign on Iran which kind of definitely lead to the current economic collapse and currency collapse in Iran uh society. Like how do you think the Iranian young people view America? Do you think Trump's action and current state of American politics diminish the appeal of the American model in uh Iranian youth? Well, I don't think there they know what's happening in the United States that I mean the what some of the I guess uh much more you know savvy would would follow the press and know what's that uh democracy is being rapidly eroded in United States.
>> Yeah.
>> But what they see is they hate if they if you hate the regime and someone comes along and says I'm going to help you against your detested regime. uh people naturally uh say, "Oh, good. Uh I'll take your support."
>> Yeah.
>> But I think what's happened in the last few days is actually significant.
>> Yeah.
>> Because in in the in Iranian history, the oil issue was very important. Yeah.
>> You know, most they wanted to say we we should have our oil. The uh the Brits at that time wanted to get our oil and The British attitude was why is our British oil under your ground? We're going to take it back. And what uh Trump has done with with uh Venezuela is revive that me memory because now people openly see that uh Trump is actually uh focused on on Venezuela because he's saying American oil is on the Venezuelan ground. Uh I'm going to take it back.
>> Yeah. Exactly. So if he does that with Venezuela, why not with Iran too?
>> Yeah. So that you think that could change the perception like uh from American if American to invade uh Iran like the Iranian people would probably have a very complicated view on that.
>> Yes. Yeah.
>> Okay. So um I think the invasion of uh Iran by the United States probably supported by Israel could happen, right? Like I I almost I almost thought it would happen like this weekend, but it seems like they tuned down the uh rhetoric nowadays. Do you think that's a realistic possibility like uh Trump would invade Iran and really try to occupy the country?
>> No, I mean it's it's it's a big country. It I don't think that the US has that manpower or will to do it.
>> Yeah.
>> So their alternative and I think they're aware of that. So what is their strategy? Uh if they know they can't invade and uh just the pressure isn't going to bring about uh regime change uh the strategy then off is obviously uh destruction of the state.
>> Mhm. So they basically set up some kind of puppy u proxy war, right? Like in inside Iran, like support certain um protest groups, like militarize certain areas and then try to have them fight against each other, right? Basically start a civil war in Iran.
>> Yeah. We people forget you know when there were demonstrations started against um in Syria against the government there was a massive import of American arms.
>> Yeah.
>> Some of it actually went to the jihadists.
>> Oh
>> to ISIS and but some of it went to other groups uh Kurds uh Jews and so on. So basically Syria broke apart because you had armed groups all over the place.
>> Mhm. So that may be what they're planning to do with Iran because if the other alternatives are not there uh it's easy to pour arms into the country especially when you have some ethnic uh issues uh with especially in Kurdistan Baluchistan and the Arab territories even among the Turkish minority uh you just pour in the arms and there'll be basically the consequence will be ethnic ethnic violence.
>> Yeah. So, um do you think the current regime after looking at the example of North Korea we may may finally cross the threshold and weaponize it nuclear program as a deterrent?
>> Oh, it's that's unknown. I mean Trump claimed it solved the problem because he bombed the main installations. We don't know how much damage it did.
>> Yeah. Uh and then the the Iranians have been quite smart about it that basically their attitude is if you think you did that that's fine you can believe that but we don't know actually how much uranium there is and what's happening with it. So uh if the revolution I mean the present government have advisors uh civilians who are much per in favor of some sort of settlement with the United States but with the revolutionary guards if they were totally in power uh I don't think there would be any uh any moderation with them they would have followed much more the uh North Korean model.
>> Yeah. So, uh you know, some scholars argue the West, which we represent the moral high ground, should actively intervene to liberate Iran. As a historian, do you view uh US ideological pressure as a genuine effort to support a freedom or it's simply a tool for hijgemony like global hijgemony? Well, we can just take the example of uh of Iraq.
>> Yeah.
>> Or Libya. I mean, how much was rhetoric about especially for internal consumption, American consumption, how much did they really believe that they were going to be uh creating democracy? I I I mean I was teaching a course on Iraq before the invasion. read a lot of books about Iraq and my students basically had scratched their heads when I thought whenever Bush talked about democracy because
>> yeah knew anything about uh Iraqi history uh the basically once it broke the central government it was 100% sure that there would be black fragmentation in the whole society there yeah all all the conventional books on Iraq basically led you to that.
>> Yeah.
>> Somehow in Washington they built up this notion that the the country was dying for democracy and all they had to do was get rid of Saddam Hussein.
>> Yeah. I think that's a big problem nowadays particularly for the neoconservative part ideology. They always believe that yeah we are the good guy they're the bad guy. Those are non democratic government. Those are evil government. we have to get rid of them to liberate the people. they have that um moral argument which is hard to argue against because just from the ideology perspective everybody want to be liberated to have freedom to have rights have human rights right
>> however on the other side when you look at the reality all the history just tell you this is such a bad idea it kills more people it kills more civilian the country become a rubber state like all it's become super dysfunctional there's no rule of law and it's A it's a warm bat for the extremist groups like ISIS right those uh terrorist groups kind of grow out of that chaos so from a historian perspective how do we break this kind of cycle because right now in the western uh uh media they often talk about oh we are trying to save the Iranian people we are trying to stop the government from massacring their civilians which is part of them is true but again you the conse consequence of your activity will create another bigger chaos which is often not talked about enough.
>> Well, I mean I think there the way to deal with it is to show the hypocrisy. I mean they're talking now about uh military intervention to prevent civilians being killed in the last two years has been backing up Israel in
>> Yeah. Exactly. You know you're nowadays people openly say you know what Israel carried out genocide.
>> Yeah. Exactly.
>> What was done with United States endorsement US arms and US money. Uh so for the uh US to suddenly turn around and say they're in Iran in involved in Iran um especially militarily to save Iranians from being killed. It it's just so hypocritical. I it it'd be hard to actually sell that line.
>> I think I think majority I I would say like uh probably uh this is also divided in the ideology ground. So if you look at the Trump supporters like those neoccom wararmonger those senate like Lindsey Graham for example he's like pounding the table we're going to liberate uh the Iranian people. On the other hand he's supporting Israel doing genocide in Gaza like uh for two years completely two years. he didn't say a thing about like liberating the people the Palestinians. So I think for those type of the supporters, they don't really have the critical thinking or they they they tend to believe whatever the supreme leader like a Trump says like in the media. How do we kind of break that barrier like
>> Yeah. Well, Graham can talk like that, but actually if there was actually need for rounding up American troops or national guard to go to to occupy it, uh then they'll have second thoughts about that. Yeah, I think there going to be a huge backlash because American lives if any soldier got killed in that war or whatever that intervention, Trump's support base will have a civil war internally because there a certain part of the MAGA base is against the war against any foreign interventions.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. So, some of my audience actually have a very interesting question. They are curious about how uh does Iranian people view the Chinese because I know like nowadays the current regime is actually working with China to u do business and uh sustain some of the economic activities but some others would argue that China is actually supporting such a authoritarian regime which is suppressing its own people. What's your perspective on that?
>> It's hard to tell. I mean for I think for many Iranians uh China is actually successful model for economic development. So they're in awe of the of the Chinese model. I don't think it could it's a model that it could be replicated in Iran. But many people actually thought that way. There was a famous president in Iran who actually was sort of openly saying that Iran Iran should follow the Chinese model.
>> Yeah.
>> It's I think it it's very different partly because uh the Iranian working class is much more actually uh assertive. Mhm.
>> There's a long tradition of labor activities and to create a discipline cheap labor in Iran is is a is a uh pie in the sky. It's not it's not feasible to do that.
>> It's that's because of the culture, right? Like the the the cultural difference, you think? Uh yeah, I cultural uh people are much more assertive about uh about rights uh especially they're being exploited. So it's it's you don't have that sort of pool of uh disciplined labor.
>> Yeah. So I think China and Iran are all like you know countries with a long history and um they they also take pride in their identity right uh I would say like recent centuries China has uh adopt a very successful model but part of that pieces is like a really good relationship with the United States why didn't Iranian government kind of adopt that route I know like you know 1979 that uh the abduction of the uh the American embassy, right? Like you have you kind of create a scar on that. But like why didn't the the government try to kind of move away from the ideology? Is that kind of kind of locked in because of the clergic regime?
>> Well, there were two lines. I mean on the rhetoric, you know, in the street for demonstrations, the regime often used these silly slogans, you know, death to is United States.
>> Yeah.
>> Death to Israel, this was mostly rhetoric.
>> Mhm. But when you came down to actually negotiations, uh the Iranian governments, even conservative ones, very pro-clerical ones, uh were willing to negotiate uh compromise with United States.
>> Mhm.
>> So it wasn't like they were unwilling to do it. They would have followed the Chinese model about a rapro with United States. It was always a United States with the exception of Obama. the other United States presidents including uh after uh Bush um and thenuh more recently with the Democran relationship ship has been determined by the United States rather than by Iran.
>> Do you think Israel play a huge role in this? Because you know Benjamin Netanyahu he basically came to US Congress in the 90s like pounding around the table say we have to invade Iran. We have to dismantle the Iran government. Do you think that plays a huge role in the US foreign policy with Iran? Yeah. I mean the reason Netanu was so upset was because uh Obama actually made an agreement with Iran.
>> Yeah. The JCPOA, right? Like he he actually
>> So that was the only period where the Iran American president was willing to actually negotiate with Iran.
>> And there have been other periods where even you have a despicable regime in Iran. They were willing to negotiate. It was the negotiation came from United States.
>> Yeah. So do you think um because of the Israel's influence on US policy makers probably until the time when the Israel lobby do not take control of the Americans president and senators we could have a final negotiation with Iran like the US because I think from my perspective as American right the Iranian doesn't pose any threat to America like they even though they are advancing certain technology they have no incentive to really bomb US however for Israel that's a different story because they are all regional power in Middle East
>> yeah I mean you're right I think it's uh it's also it goes back to basically after the revolution 79
>> when the US lost basically its embassy in Thran what they did was they outsourc forced US uh policy on Iran to Israel.
>> Yeah.
>> So basically they said the Israelis know what's happening in Iran. We'll rely on Israel to tell us what's going on and we'll rely on them. Uh so the advice always on how to deal with Iran was actually in in Washington. The decision was made by Israel. The exception was Obama
>> uh when he said we need to actually come to an agreement with Iran.
>> Yeah.
>> That's what then Natinario basically became frantic and he invited himself to Congress.
>> Yeah.
>> To appeal to the Republicans and Apac to say this was the worst agreement you could have signed.
>> Yeah. Uh and so then Trump basically echoed the same. This was the worst agreement you America's ever signed. In fact, it was a very good agreement and people who denounced it didn't read it. Um and it would the present crisis wouldn't exist if the agreement was actually kept.
>> Exactly.
>> Yeah. I actually uh made a video uh just describing that part of history because it's very tough negotiation. Iranian within itself like you have the moderate one who want to negotiate with us and you also have the extremist party which like we're will be the hardliners we're never going to uh negotiate with Americans or the Israel and I think what Trump did withdrawing from that JCPOA really killed the moderate because their argument failed. the hardlining will say look when you spend all this effort energy negotiate with Americans and three years later they withdraw what's the outcome of this it's horrible right so I think it's uh it's really sad situation to to watch right now because of the the withdrawal of that agreement
>> well what is interesting is in if you look at the mainstream media in America
>> yesterday there was a long aret piece In New York Times, they talk about all these conflicts between Iran and United States. They have a complete amnesia about that agreement and that it was the United States that actually destroyed that agreement. It's as if that agreement never existed.
>> Yeah, that's I think it's a propaganda machine, you know, like it just tried to sell uh the story that Iran is such a evil regime. We have to really dismantle it. There's no other way around. I think that's that's what they try to sell.
>> Yeah. Or I mean I don't think it's that it's basically from the top it's structured to do that. It's just basically uh tunnel vision.
>> I know
>> uh that they perceive it the way the actually uh they're in a way from hindsight or from historical background uh see the situation. So for them, if there are horrendous mistakes, it's always on the other side, not on on our side.
>> The the problem I kind of see the argument that Benjamin Netanyahu is presenting is I just don't see any way around from like he I think his goal is really just to destroy the current state of the Iranian government and make Iran into a dysfunctional state. There's no other way around. like he will say, "Oh, if you negotiate with the Iranian people and Iranian government, you sign that JCPOA, that's a terrible uh agreement and they're going to use that money they're going to make from that uh lifting all the sanctions. They're going to really develop the technology and eventually they're going to build a nuclear bomb. It's not falsifiable because you are just like asserting those things that didn't happen."
>> Yeah. I don't know how how you can actually argue with Netanyahu because his vision his goal is already set. There's only one outcome out of this like he want to dismantle Iran's government.
>> Yeah. I want to say that. I mean he keeps on saying that he loves Iran. He loves Iranians. U they could have a good friend relationship but if you can't negotiate and or even if you negotiate then you pull the rug out of it. Yeah.
>> Then it's I think the logic leads to what you said that the politension is a dismantling of the state.
>> I think he doesn't want to negotiate. He doesn't like to negotiate. If you look at the history like he just killed all the negotiators like if you send a top negotiator to negotiation site, they they have those uh snipers or other drone attacks just kill those negotiator. I don't know how they negotiate like by doing that. So what what do you think could be the outcome of the current protest? I kind of see the rhetoric kind of tuned down a little bit. I part of the reason I think Trump decide not to attack Iran is all the other surrounding countries like Qatar, they say, "Oh, you you cannot use our military side to attack Iran for this time." I think those kind of push Trump back, not really attack Iran now. that I think is where yeah I'm not sure even if they attack whether that will solve the problem I mean I way I can see it is the present sort of no war no peace but constant tension
>> continuing indefinitely
>> uh because regime is not going to collapse and you actually there's no also feasible possibility of invasion occupation then it's a ongoing crisis. Uh unfortunately,
>> yeah, I I just feel it's really unfortunate that um Trump and the other leaders that say, "Oh, we're standing with the Iranian people. You guys should just continue to protest." And then the government commit this uh massacre, kill a lot of Iranian people. And then they did they did nothing. They just say, "Oh, I think the Iranian government is behaving better." Like they they said they're going to hand 800 people. Now they stop it. So we're going to deactivate the tension. What about those people who believed in your propaganda and go on the street like protests?
>> Well, I mean or actually the protests uh people will protest other ways rather than going into the demonstration.
>> Exactly.
>> Uh or some people might even rally around the government. So it's it's not a one-way street.
>> Yeah. I think one of the biggest uh difference between the nowadays protest and the revolution happened in 1979 is the army's attitude right I think right now the supreme leader did not lose any control or any support from the revolutionary guards so a lot of people who say oh uh if the US not really invading Iran the regime will just continue to exist
>> well you know I the sha had a huge military one of the biggest militaries, but in fact it was a conscript army.
>> Mhm.
>> Uh he could rely on 7,000 imperial guards.
>> 7,000. That was the only real reliable force. 7,000. You can't carry out even a co with a 7,000.
>> Yeah. The present regime has a basically a very ideological revolutionary guards.
>> Yeah.
>> Who are volunteers or especially chosen from families that support the regime.
>> But there these are people who are willing to go out and kill civilians on lows.
>> Yeah. So what do you think about the support of the current superior leader? I know like the clergic regime they typically have a lot of grassroot support like from the the very poor class you know that people who have no land or any like you know income those are the typical supporter for the clergic regime is that is that the case because like a lot of protester they are the bazar class they actually have money they have some influence in the political system
>> uh it's not the very poor for it's much more support from uh small farmers, countryside uh sons of uh I would say lower middle class.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh who come from very uh traditional religious families.
>> Mhm.
>> They especially recruited into the revolutionary guards.
>> Mhm. Uh so there for them uh there is no cultural clash.
>> Uh so there is also between them and the demonstrators there's a class difference because many demonstrators are often educated or from the modern middle class or university students. So uh that is then seen in in terms of class difference uh which in a way reinforces the strength of the revolutionary guards.
>> Mhm.
>> Yeah. It's uh right now I don't see any way of this revolution guard turn against the supreme leader. Um even though you see the social unrest but like they when they counting the number they think that that's nowhere comp comparable to the 1979 right you have 3 million people on the street
>> protesting. Yeah.
>> Yeah. So that's very interesting. Is there any possibility they can like vote in public for change of the constitution? Because like you know 1979 when homminy does uh gain the power he did it through this uh rush voting on the on the constitution
>> there I mean the actual constitution has uh clauses
>> where you can uh you can uh amend the constitution. they've already amended the constitution when hy died so that hy could succeed him so that there is a precedent for amendments or changes so there is on paper that
>> but I don't think the present structure will uh permit that unless there is so much continued uh pressure from below
>> the rational thing then would be to sort of change the constitution to make it less theocratic, more secular and that would stabilize the regime. But again, uh you need a lot of foresight and flexibility on people who have authority to do that.
>> Mhm. I heard like uh reported by the news there are thousands of uh Iranian people got killed in the during this social unrest and protest you know in the street. Do you think that kind of cause the current uh regime lose legitimacy? I think like when this protest happens that means like they're already losing leg legitimacy because a lot of people are against the current regime.
>> Yeah. I mean the bloodshed I think increases tensions but the regime is now actually arguing that some of the people killed are killed by the demonstrators and that it's the uh people from the revolutionary guards that are getting killed. So yeah using this also as a way of uh bolstering the regime. Yeah, I definitely see their reporting on the uh revolution guard got killed like there's like hundreds of them like a hund something uh because of the protesters they have weapons like this weapon must come from other foreign uh imported right
>> I mean the regime claims that I don't know if it's true but it's probably good propaganda line to follow
>> yeah yeah so it's uh I don't know it's uh it's very sad to see what happened nowadays in Iran And uh I just feel like it's it's a deadlock. It's it's probably going to stay in this format for a while because the current regime won't collapse unless the US uh intervate invade the country. But the US also faced a huge consequence if they do that and also it's going to be and end up in a very worse situation because the his history cannot tell us repeatedly uh that what will happen. What's what do you think could be a possible outcome like a good outcome kind of this current situation?
>> Um I can't see a good out outcome unless you know people at the top in Iran I mean both in Iran and Washington if Washington agreed to some sort of settlement which means it's going back to the Obama agreement which they say is they're not going to do that. So that that excludes that regard. Uh Iran can also open up but whether that would solve the problem is not uh doesn't deal with it because they can open up but the sanctions will continue the economic crisis will continue. Do you think uh the US and the Israel government may do something what they did to the Venezuela? They do uh special operation and capture the supreme leader that style like they they just like kidnap him and then take him back to Washington for trial.
>> Well, that it's it's a stunt. I mean, what they did is not a success in Venezuela. It's a stunt for the American TV watchers that US can do this. But it doesn't solve the problem. The the the the same regime is still in
>> power. Yeah.
>> So they have a guy in in in Brooklyn in prison. Uh
>> yeah.
>> And this the uh Trump calls says he's going to basically run the oil in uh Venezuela, but no oil company where really wants to go in there. They know how unstable it is. So that I mean if even if they grab hommin I don't know what the how is that going to solve the problem. Yeah, I kind of see. I I I I still think um the better way is just like form some kind of negotiation, go back to the JCPOA style uh nuclear settlement agreement, have a international organization, go in Iran, check on those nuclear facilities, ensure both parties kind of follow that agreement and then have a peaceful transformation of Iran society. That would be really ideal.
>> Yeah.
>> Ideal situation. Yeah,
>> but that's all in the hands of Washington and I don't see that happening.
>> Yeah. Do you do you think Iran's current situation is the outcome of um the tragedy of the state power competition in the global format because US and also Israel they want to dominate the region and Iran is a regional power that's why like it was targeted by both countries.
>> Yeah. I mean, Iran also could have been much more savvy on how to deal with that.
>> Right after the revolution, the the hostage crisis was unnecessary. It was done to do with
>> uh Iran's power. It was basically
>> to uh create a a clerical republic. that was the agenda of the
>> so those uh use of those foreign issues to strengthen internal power of the clergy uh had its costs and they didn't the government in Iran should have thought about the costs
>> they were arrogant about that that they could deal with that um but so actions have their costs and um it's basically created a much more of an antagonistic situation both between Iran and Iran Israel and United States. But even if those things had not been there, I think you're right. There is a question of state rivalry
>> and uh Israel and US saw Iran as a basically a state rival in the region.
>> Yeah, I saw there's some comment in my um video about Iran history. They basically say that uh hommin and homonye they are basically communist disguised as a clergic class. So you don't think that's a reason argument? There's no similarity between those two ideology. I mean they think that communist ideology is also similar to a religion ideology.
>> Yeah. But these guys are I mean these guys were vehemently anti Marxist anti-leftist. There there was the idea I mean the the royalist created this myth that somehow the clergy had been educated in Moscow in secret places to
>> Yeah.
>> Uh it it makes a good James Bond story but there's no evidence and no truth in that. No,
>> I know if you look at the the communist countries um history they destroy all the religions like they don't want any religion or any like you know religion class. Well, even if they did that, but the idea that somehow the these guys in control in Iran are linked to the Soviet Union, there is no Soviet Union now. So,
>> all right. Professor, what do you think about the current United States uh foreign policy compared to what uh China is adopting? You know, like China has been criticized for working with all this authoritarian regime. But on the other hand, if you look at US uh foreign policy, they put on sanctions but for the country who got sanctioned actually working with China may be supporting a lifeline. So how do you kind of view that in a like nonmoral like you can you can view it from a moral perspective and nonmoral perspective like how do you view that argument like which style of foreign policy is more favorable in your perspective? I
>> I mean I don't see the that difference. I mean the both China and United States their interest is uh their own uh basically national interests. So in some places they will deal with fairly despicable states if it's in their interests. Uh if it's not interest they might then talk about liberty, individualism and stuff. I think the US is more willing to use that language when they disagree with the state. The Chinese government are basically more down to earth. They say you know we'll deal with everyone. Uh it doesn't matter what their internal policies are.
>> Yeah. So basically you see like both country actually adopt a p pragmatic way of handling their foreign relationships. It it's the only difference that u I think our government the United States government have this uh ideology tool they can use when they try to invade countries like Iraq because on the other hand they are working with Saudi Arabia. They have no problem of they killing a US citizen like like a US green card holder in the embassy like they don't have any problem with that.
>> Well, I mean now I think that there's a more complicated situation in that uh the US uh basically says it's previous agreements have no meaning that can change night.
>> The Chinese policy is much more basically predictable that once we have an agreement we keep it. uh there is a rule of law or international law will observe that.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh so for most countries it makes more sense to have agreements with China rather than United States because you you don't know or you could be part of NATO have a long relationship with United States and then one day uh the president gets up and says no no I'm part of your territory.
>> Yeah.
>> You're an ally. The Chinese don't behave that way.
>> Yeah. I I it pains me to watch the current US government doing all those rhetoric and saying like we have to have Greenland and then splitting all these lies that the Russians and Chinese are going to occupy Greenland. No, they're not. They don't have anything around that that place. Like US has military forces staying in that region like just right now on the Greenland. And we can put more troops on the Greenland if we want. we decide chose not to like now that we all of a sudden we want to take that territory that just
>> pains me to watch it.
>> It's not even that. I mean even trade agreements that you sign and been long there suddenly you wake up and Washington says no we would changing the rules. I mean the Chinese haven't done that so far that I know of. Oh
>> yeah. I think I think it's just like I I look at the headlines a lot of Western leaders kind of all going to China and start to uh warm up the relationship. You know, this is basically a collapse of US ally system. Basically,
>> we just don't have any real allies like no allies can trust us anymore. No, I mean the Chinese government is I think more uh capitalistic than American government because to have capitalism you need some rule of law and predictability uh and uh they're following that principle where the US is actually breaking all those principles. So
>> um it's not good for business if you don't have some reliable uh rules to obey. I know, professor. I don't know if you follow the US domestic policy or like politics. Um, but I think uh the midterm is coming. Do you see uh the Democrat party may win back the House?
>> Yeah, I mean the polls now seem to indicate that the the Republicans are in pro trouble especially I mean not because of foreign policy but economic situation. I mean
>> uh prices inflation uh the job market uh loss of health care rising prices of healthcare especially um so a lot of people here I think feel that they've been taken for a ride.
>> Yeah.
>> Uh so there might be a a backlash in the in the elections. Of course, the Republicans also have means to try to limit that and uh basically suppression of the vote and so on. So, we'll see what happens.
>> Yeah. Do do you worry that US may someday turn into authoritarian regime? We kind of see some bad signs like, you know, you have the ICE agent in Minnesota shooting American citizen and all the lies that the current administration is splitting out in in front of us. Uh yeah it's I mean moving that way I I I expect there'll be enough uh basically counter movement from that.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I I think so. I firmly believe that some of the opposition parties and the movement will be happening because people are not happy about what happened uh under the Trump administration. So look at the polls. Um 58% of the Americans think the Trump's first year of uh governance is a failure. So hopefully we'll see like uh it's really great honor to have you on the podcast and I really enjoy the conversation with you discussing uh Iran situation. I really hope the Iranian government can settle down like um just basically stabilize the situation and find a way out and negotiate a deal with the US and probably Israel. Okay, we'll keep our fingers crossed.
>> Yeah, same. Thank you so much.
>> Thanks for the program. Thank you.
