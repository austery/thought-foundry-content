um I decided to study law cuz I thought you know law is for clever people I was a clever girl that's what I wanted to do um absolutely love law um went to bit to Cambridge did a bit of English law that was great um obviously I was a good law student I was a good girl so obviously I was going to qualify as a lawyer in Paris in one of the big law firms started out there and just realized it was a shot it was definitely not for me um it was basically everything I'm not so I'm a bit of an energetic person I like to move around you don't want to be a corporate lawyer because you're going to be change your desk um I also like to feel that I have some form of impact in what I'm doing you don't want to start at the bottom in a corporate offer so basically sitting in Paris uh next to the sh in this big corporate law firm realizing that was not exactly what I wanted to do I start to think a bit about obviously when you're in this kind of situation you start to think a bit about what do you actually want to do and I thought back to uh this great place this great thing that I'd followed for quite some time uh the region Sovereign wealth fund I'll on that and basically in 20 back in 2007 so when I was in my first year of law I remember reading this magnificent article in luo basically saying that you know the Norwegian people are one of the biggest investors in the French stock market and you know when you're a Norwegian you read that you're a bit like how can this be true and then you read a bit further and you realized this this amazing fund um that is ours um and basically so sitting there in Paris I was like maybe they have a job for me that would be great um applied to the graduate program ended up being the first one who was non Finance or non-eng engineering taken into the program which they told me when they called me which was a bit so you know when you're being told oh we're buing you out kind of as the first non Finance person you're a bit like oh okay no pressure there um so started in MIM in 2014 actually I started in Lo though um and tried a bit of corporate governance which is quite related to law in a way uh but then got moved to sector strategies the investment side in London and just have stayed ever since um so I moved up you can see I'm getting bigger and bigger so hopefully towards the end I'm huge um but basically 2017 went up to analyst and then in the Magnificent Co year of 2020 when we were sitting at home I started my portfolio um so that's been a long journey um and a journey that I'm still on um and basically every day I jump around and you know get to have an impact get to be energetic get to go out there and find good Investments so I'm Still Loving It um I just want to to okay we already have a penguin that's good um I just want to talk a bit about um just a normalist day so basically in when you when you're working with markets no day is really normal because the world isn't normal right you know the the morning I woke up and Russia had invad the Ukraine that was not a normal day um so we have all these days that are a bit un normal but I would say there are periods which are more like others and that's basically when companies report earnings so that's basically company will rep report Financial um results four times a year most likely and those obviously those are companies I'm invested in or not invested in so I follow them quite closely and these days are quite fullon and I've just finished the full year results period coming out of that I was like okay now this is a normal day I'm going to present to you um so this is a normal day that I had in February more or less so I woke up that's great uh when a company reports it tends to be before Market opens so since I'm on London time if it's a European company that will be before uh quarter past 8 in the morning uh so it' be usually be around 6:30 7 um so when companies report you don't go to the gym you don't do morning yoga you kind of just get up and you're like half under your duvet looking at what's happening um they will usually also do um a call so the CEO the CFO will talk about their results so usually you would listen to that listen to what they say uh maybe drag out your laptop at 7:00 a.m. in the morning under your duvet try to figure out in your financial model company model what it actually means um at one point when you've done all this uh you actually get yourself to work and when you go to work obviously the first thing you do is just browse remouse to just check if something special has happened in markets I should be aware of related to my investments um and the moment you realize that's not happening you go back to your earnings uh you also look at your portfolio because you can't control yourself you have to see if you're making money or not that day if it's going up you're happy if it's going down you're not happy um and then you continue you try to continue because you're in the middle of earnings so you probably have a CEO meeting and the CEO is probably coming into your comp into your office um you've probably already prepped it so you have a meeting either obviously on Zoom or in person then done meeting going back to your desk and then it's time to do a tiny bit of research in between these meetings so most likely you will browse your you see if there's again anything's happened to your companies is there any research reports I want to read um I also have a lot of dashboards with data on my companies so for example um I cover hotels I get credit card card data on hotels so do I see any change in how much people are spending on holiday in different part of the world maybe not um are you guys still subscribing to Netflix or not are you still password sharing or not U that's kind of data I would look at um and then obviously there will be parts of stuff going back into different kinds of models thinking about different stuff yeah and then in the middle of my European day us Market's open and then everything turns around again and then at one point you kind of go low on battery um and that will be the time where I will teams Venicia and go like hey marks are crazy do you want a coffee and then we will pedal off um and have a bit of a coffee and then obviously I need to be back to my desk cuz the company that reported today most likely is coming in again tomorrow to see me um because obviously as as big shareholders of every single company out there we have an awful lot of meetings with CEOs um so I will prep that meeting that was my coffeee um then I'll prep the meeting and you know what that's probably a Swedish company so they'll come in 8:00 a.m. tomorrow into my office and this day has been so full on so maybe I should just get out of there go to spinning class with my pig boom um I want to talk a bit about just the investment process I run and kind of how what we call the investment simulator fits into fits into that um there's there's not an awful lot of emojis on the screen so it's a bit harder maybe to comprehend but um but what I want to talk about and vanisha touched a bit upon it but if you think about the start of any investment process it usually starts with valuation and when I say valuation I mean what's the price of the stock today and what is expected uh what's the expected value of that stock that corresponds to that price and that's the start of any investment and then you think okay so the value of that stock that is quoted today is is that correct is there something there that I can research or think about that makes me think that this company is actually worth a lot more or a lot less um so basically that's when you start kind of thesis building and thesis building is basically the core of the research process it's me saying Netflix is trading at 450 USD um do I think it's worth that do I actually think this whole password thing is actually going to work out really great for them and they're going to bust all you guys from sharing and they going to earn more money and they're going to be more valuable baby right um and how I can kind of go about that is I can talk to the company um I can talk to experts who maybe people who worked at Netflix before who can talk to me about it I can actually go out and talk to people who use Netflix that's actually quite a lot of fun because Netflix is something everyone uses and everyone can tell me about how annoying the whole password thing has been lately uh but then again I can also understand that you can't share anymore so so that actually they will earn more money um all these things kind of makes me determine whether it is worth more money and I should buy um say I decide to buy Netflix uh on the back of this whole password sharing thing um then I go into what I would consider execution phase and that's kind of where what we call the investment simulator comes in so execution phas for me is when I put Stephy biased 4 not 40 million of Netflix into my training system um when I put that into the trading system the investment simulator will have accumulated a lot of data of how I've traded previously so it will sometimes feed stuff back to me saying you know you've been really poor at trading Netflix before or you know um Netflix consensus number isn't actually going up or it will tell me lots of different stuff that will pop up on the screen um you can this could be your reaction to what I've been trying to explain to you if it is I just want to show you what the investment simulator or my trading system looks like so basically we have what we call the simulation that's this is not my portfolio by the way I don't trade Nintendo and Ubisoft but this would be the the companies in my portfolio I would have different weights on them and then for example I would put in the trade I would say oh let's buy 3% of my portfolio in PayPal that's great company um and then before I actually click buy or sell I will get these signals up up there so the market signals um there will be data that the investment simulator drags in from markets so it will be uh is there a high or low short interest is there a lot of investors who don't believe this companies have been shorting it that's a good thing for me to know um the best part is stole the PM signals again venisha might have touched upon the bias as part of the whole puzzle this is where it tells me that I have biases um and obviously it's very hard to tell yourself you have biases uh so if you data or a machine does it for you um that is quite good so again it can tell me maybe I'm not particularly good at what we call off Benchmark positions uh maybe so if I'm not maybe I should think about that maybe I'm particularly good at big orders small orders um maybe I'm particularly good at buying companies when I've had a meeting with them which is data we can get because obviously they know when I've had a meeting and they know if I sold or bought after that meeting um again if this makes no sense to you which I could totally understand because this looks very confusing and I have tons of uh Financial words up there you're very welcome to come and find me and we can have a chat about it thank you
