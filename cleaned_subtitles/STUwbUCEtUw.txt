Let me introduce you to Andrés Rojas.
Every couple of weeks,
Andrés hikes deep
in the Colombian rainforest,
passing through mud
and swarms of mosquitoes.
Not for adventure,
definitely not for fun,
but to do his job.
He needs to replace batteries
and change memory cards of camera traps
and bioacoustic devices.
This is the critical infrastructure
of conservation science today.
People like Andrés are heroes
and thanks to their effort,
they have saved species
from the brink of extinction.
There are 200,000
conservationists in the world,
and all of them share one thing in common.
To do their job, they need data.
But we live in an interesting
world where we have refrigerators
that can text you
if you’re running out of milk,
[but] conservationists still
need to hike for days
just to see if an animal passed by.
Conservation today is heroic, is needed,
but is painfully slow.
Last year I was proudly presenting
at a biodiversity conference
some of our latest AI models.
But it was in fact
a very humbling moment.
Because, when presenting to them,
I realized that even though
they were using our models,
once you understood the hassle
that they needed to go through,
from installing these devices
to collecting the data
to eventually [having] time to analyze it,
I realized that our solutions
were not making such big of a difference.
I realized that in order
for us to make a difference,
we need to completely reinvent
how data works in biodiversity.
This is why we developed SPARROW.
SPARROW stands for Solar-Powered Acoustic
Remote Recording Observation Watch.
SPARROW is a small network of devices
that act as a hub in the middle of nature,
connecting to camera traps,
acoustic devices, sensors,
processing the information
using solar power.
Processing the information
on the edge using a low-voltage GPU.
Sending results back
using a low-orbit satellite.
With SPARROW, you install it once,
you no longer need
to hike to collect data,
you can connect online
and see the data real-time.
One of my biggest lessons in life
is the realization that we, as humans,
are addicted to complexity.
We like complex projects
and we like complex things.
This is the reason we put
a person on the Moon
before we added wheels to your luggage.
(Laughter)
Don't get me wrong,
if you want to impress people,
your solutions can be complex.
If you want to have
an impact in the world,
if you want people to use your solutions,
your solutions need to be simple.
Building simple solutions is hard,
but it's certainly worth the effort.
This is why our most important
principle designing SPARROW
is to keep it simple.
Simple to develop, simple to deploy,
simple to assemble.
SPARROW is open source.
Anyone, from conservation
scientists to researchers
to park rangers can use it
and improve upon it.
You don't buy a SPARROW.
You buy off-the-shelf components
and you assemble it together.
If you have the ability to assemble
your own Ikea furniture,
and I know that's not for everybody --
(Laughter)
you're ready to assemble a SPARROW.
Even if simple, SPARROW
is actually quite powerful.
Camera traps is a technology
that was created four decades ago.
They have a sensor,
and any time that they see movement,
they take a picture.
Some of that movement
is caused by animals.
Majority of that movement is caused
by wind or something else that moves.
That's why majority of the pictures
that camera traps took today
look like these ones.
No animals in them.
This is a big hassle for conservationists
because in order for them 
to get just a few
pictures of the species 
they care [about],
they need to review thousands of pictures,
costing them hundreds
of hours of their time.
SPARROW solves this problem.
With SPARROW,
we have AI models
that can automatically classify
and identify the animals in them.
But SPARROW goes further.
SPARROW not only can find a giraffe,
SPARROW can find that giraffe.
Animals like giraffes
have a unique pattern,
and that unique pattern
doesn't change over time.
You can use these to re-identify,
it's like a fingerprint,
you can use [them] to re-identify
that particular giraffe.
Animal re-identification
is critical for conservation
because it allows them to understand
things like survival
or even measure population.
SPARROW can automatically do this.
And thanks to our collaboration
with the Wild Nature Institute,
we have this model running
in SPARROW today.
While a picture might be worth
a thousand words,
if we only focus on pictures,
we might be missing
the forest for the trees.
When you look at a picture like this,
you don't see any animal.
But if you listen, the story is different.
(Animals vocalizing)
SPARROW has the ability
to isolate and classify sounds.
Here, for example, there's a frog.
(Frog croaks)
That's a cicada.
(Cicada buzzes)
That's a macaw.
(Macaw chatters)
Thanks to SPARROW,
through sound, we can measure
the true health of a forest.
Identifying an animal
from a picture is not difficult.
Identifying sound
requires very deep expertise.
People like Paula Caycedo
from Fundación Biodiversa Colombia
have this expertise.
In every expedition,
she collects 600 hours' worth of sounds.
And then she listens
to every one of these hours.
This is like binge watching
the whole complete eight seasons
of “Game of Thrones” ten times --
(Laughter)
just to get a few samples
of the animal she cares [for].
SPARROW can help people like Paula.
Paula can train SPARROW
to focus on a particular animal
or a particular call,
so she can save hundreds
of hours of her time,
so she can focus on what she does best:
having a better understanding
and helping protect the animals she loves.
Because SPARROW is connected online,
SPARROW can actually send alerts.
Wildfires are a major global threat,
costing lives, billions in infrastructure
and the complete destruction
of some of the most important
biodiversity ecosystems.
In a wildfire, every minute counts.
Detect it early, and you can
stop it with a shovel.
But if you wait, you will need
bulldozers, air tankers
and sometimes a miracle.
SPARROW has the ability
to do early detection of fire
and send alerts to authorities.
With SPARROW, we're not
only collecting data,
we can act on that data,
and that data can help save lives.
By the end of 2025,
we will have SPARROW
running in all continents.
SPARROW will change the way
biodiversity data works.
Today, conservation moves
at the speed of data,
and when a conservationist
installs a device,
to the time that it takes for that data
to eventually get analyzed today,
it takes months, sometimes a year.
With SPARROW, we want to move
from months to days.
For some species,
this difference, this delta,
can be the difference
between survival and extinction.
I dedicate this talk
to the conservationists out there
who have dedicated
and even sacrificed their lives
to help protect biodiversity
on this planet.
They might not wear capes,
but make absolutely no mistake,
they are superheroes.
Yet they need our help.
Our job, our responsibility,
and our commitment today
is that we will provide them
with the best tools we can
so they have a fighting chance.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
