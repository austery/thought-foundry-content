Have you noticed that in the past few years?
It’s increasingly difficult to communicate with people with different opinions online
Some people in Taiwan suspect voting in presidential election
An endless stream of discriminatory remarks
America has global warming deniers
<font color=#FFF200FF>Climate change agenda Is a hoax.</font>
<font color=#FFF200FF>Climate change agenda Is a hoax.</font>
flat earth conspiracy theory
<font color=#FFDD00FF>The earth is not round because we can't prove it's globe.</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>It's not because we can't prove it's globe.</font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>So what is this picture? If not a live instant picture of the Earth, what would it be? </font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>So what is that then? What I'm looking at if i'm not looking at a live picture? </font>
<font color=#FFDD00FF>You're looking at
the CGI.</font>
Communicating and debating with others on many issues are always trying to get through the wall.
The book I’m going to face today is “Reverse Thinking”
Let’s talk about how to use psychology to break through the existing cognition
Let yourself, others, and the collective rethink
This book has sold millions of copies around the world
The author, Adam Grant, is a psychologist at the Wharton School of Business
Today we will introduce this video in three parts:
personal rethinking
Rethinking interpersonal relationships
and collective rethinking
There are three common mentalities that people have when thinking
When things we believe are questioned
people become missionaries
Want to change the other person’s beliefs
Let the other party join our camp
When there are flaws in someone else’s argument
people become prosecutors
Attack the other side's arguments like a picket line
When we want others to agree with us
will become like politicians
Use various words to persuade others to support your arguments
All three patterns prevent us from rethinking our perspectives
Psychologist Csikszentmihalyi studied master scientists and artists
I found that these people all have one thing in common
is cognitively flexible
Willingness to move from one extreme of thinking to another in a given situation
This cognitive flexibility allows them to keep an open mind
Willing to learn new knowledge and revise existing opinions
This cognitive flexibility is the basis of scientific thinking
Psychologists conducted an experiment to study 100 founders of new startups
Give them 4 months of training
A group trained in scientific thinking maintained cognitive flexibility
The control group will not receive scientific thinking training
turn out
Entrepreneurs without scientific thinking training are more likely to stick to their original business model
Average profit is less than $300
But cognitively resilient entrepreneurs
The average business profit exceeds $12,000
Because they are more willing to change business strategies based on customer feedback data
We all think that only by working hard and adhering to our original intention will we succeed
But research shows
Successful companies experiment while changing strategies
For example, Mike Lazaridis, the founder of BlackBerry
In the early stages of entrepreneurship, we used the thinking model of scientists
Build a mobile phone that can press the keyboard with your thumbs
But after the rise of Apple in 2007
Apple mobile phones incorporate many computer functions to make them more competitive
But Lazaridis still insists on his opinion and does not want to add browser features
By 2012
Apple already has 1/4 of the global market share
But BlackBerry CEO Still Won't Switch to Touch Keyboard
I think current users are very satisfied
This is a kind of "confirmation bias"
He only sees satisfied customers with their BlackBerrys
Ignore that hundreds of millions of users prefer touch keyboards
The author calls this the overconfidence cycle
People first think they understand
Look up information based on a certain belief
Feeling complacent when you find some information that confirms your thoughts
Then strengthen your beliefs
Ignore voices of differing opinions
Eventually it became a politician mentality
Want to convince others that you are right
Apple’s Steve Jobs also fell into this overconfidence cycle
In the beginning, Apple mainly produced computers and iPods, not mobile phones.
Because Jobs thinks
If you make a mobile phone that can listen to music
Instead, it will lead to loss of iPod business.
After six months of meetings and discussions, Apple engineers
It took a lot of effort to convince Steve Jobs to doubt his own beliefs.
This allowed Jobs to break the cycle of overconfidence
Entering a cycle of rethinking
First make a list of areas you don’t know about
admit one's ignorance
Let your curiosity search for relevant information
keep an open mind
Let's see what new discoveries we make
So the first step to rethinking
It’s about breaking the cycle of overconfidence.
Usually those who like to say that I am not biased
I am an objective and neutral person
more likely to be biased
Because they didn't even realize their own prejudices
Only then do you dare to declare loudly that you are more objective than others
So then we have to ask
Why are people blind to their blind spots?
How to identify your own cognitive blind spots?
Psychologists David Dunning and Justin Kruger conducted an experiment
Ask subjects to also evaluate the test scores they will receive during the test
turn out
The poorer the performers, the more likely they are to overestimate their abilities
Another survey pointed out
93% of American drivers believe their driving ability is better than the average person’s
Research statistics found that
Ask executives from around the world to assess their capabilities
As a result, without exception, managers in all countries overestimate their abilities.
This phenomenon is called the Dak effect by psychologists
People without real material are more likely to inflate themselves
Because I am not familiar with this field yet
So I thought I understood
This Dak effect has a curve
Newbies who are just starting to learn new knowledge
The Dak effect is most likely to occur
Because novices make the fastest progress when absorbing knowledge
It creates the illusion that "I seem to be powerful"
As a result, people who clearly don’t understand love to express their opinions.
But when the amount of knowledge increases to a threshold
People will find that they actually still have a lot to learn
At this time, I won’t express my opinions easily.
Afraid of showing one's ignorance
So the British philosopher Russell said
"The problem with the modern world is that fools are overconfident
and smart people are full of doubts about themselves."
People who are more capable are less confident
This is what we often hear about “imposter syndrome”
Many students who get into the prestigious National Taiwan University feel they are not worthy
I think other people are better
Imposter syndrome isn’t actually a bad thing
Because these people are successful
It’s because they keep questioning that they’re not good enough
Self-doubt will make you work harder to improve yourself
For example, candidate Halla Tómasdóttir in the 2016 Icelandic presidential election
In male-dominated political circles
Being a woman makes her feel impostor syndrome
So more willing to do more for voters
Respond personally to social media messages
Although he was not elected president in the end
But it changed the local electoral culture
In comparison
Iceland’s central bank governor David Oddsson has no knowledge of economics
After taking office, he privatized the bank.
Leading to Iceland's bankruptcy during the 2009 financial crisis
It was his ignorance of economics that gave him the Dak effect and overconfidence.
Later, in order to force him to step down,
The Icelandic parliament even passed a new bill
Require local administrative officials to have a master's degree in economics
So the second step to rethinking
Just pay attention to the balance between your own ability and self-confidence
The third step to rethinking is to accept making mistakes
Because mistakes are a sign of learning something new
Harvard University once conducted a psychology experiment
After asking students to tell their own positions
Send law students to attack their arguments
See how they react
Some people are willing to accept criticism
But some people are stubborn
For example, one student firmly believed that the Industrial Revolution was a disaster for mankind.
Technology harms nature and corrupts people's hearts
dissatisfied with desire
If technology continues to develop, human society will be doomed.
This person does not accept that his or her views are questioned
Later he became a genius mathematician
But his anti-industrial social thinking is becoming more and more extreme
It actually made him plan to kill three people with bombs.
This person is the famous American serial bomber Ted Kaczynski
If he had been doing psychology experiments at Harvard
Able to question one's own opinions
Wouldn't something so extreme happen?
Psychologists study human brain activity and discover
When our core beliefs are challenged
triggers the brain's amygdala
This is a relatively primitive brain area of ​​human beings
In ancient times, it was responsible for the fight or flight response.
That is, when our opinions are challenged
Our minds will become more defensive and closed
A "totalitarian self" will emerge
Responsible for eliminating dangerous information
But there's a way to stop your brain from triggering this reaction
Just separate your thoughts from your self-identity
Don’t get attached to ideas
"What knowledge do you believe" and "who you are" are two different things
Thus
You won’t feel like others are attacking you as a person when they refute your argument.
The reason why many master scientists can become masters
It’s because they can face their mistakes comfortably
For example, in 1992
Physicist Andrew Lyne discovers a planet orbiting a neutron star
Neutron stars only appear after supernova explosions
How could any planet exist in that situation?
He immediately submitted this huge discovery to a top scientific journal
Later published in front of thousands of scientists
As a result, Andrew Lyne admitted in person that it was his miscalculation.
But this time
He actually got a standing ovation from all the scientists present.
Admitting your mistakes won't make you look more incompetent
Scientific research is inherently about using new data to overturn past conclusions.
If you never tell yourself that I was stupid a year ago
That means you haven't learned anything this year
So how do you discover your mistakes?
A practical method is to establish a "dissent network"
The author said that he has a habit when writing books
will find a group of critics
Ask them to critique each chapter
This will allow the author to know how to improve his work.
Rather than being satisfied with our own finished products
When faced with criticism, many people tend to avoid those who criticize them
But it's not a sign of disrespect if someone criticizes you.
On the contrary, it is a sign of respect
This means I value your opinion enough to question it.
If I don't pay attention at all
Just ignore you
Another example of a dissent network is
When Pixar was making "The Incredibles"
Invited director Brad Bird
In the past, Pixar animations were all about toys, insects, and monsters.
So animation is not technically difficult
But The Incredibles was the first time Pixar drew humans
This was beyond the capabilities of computer animation drawings at the time.
But Brad Bird objected
Insist on being able to show the character’s personality
He will also deliberately find people who like to cause controversy and criticize to join the team.
Think this can inspire new perspectives
Provide more objections
For example, Brad Bird originally wanted to design Xiaojie to be able to turn into a lump of jelly
However, it was rejected by the producer due to production difficulties.
Until 14 years later
Animation technology is in place
Episode 2 of The Incredibles finally gets the idea off the ground
Dissent in this network of dissent
The first episode of "The Incredibles" won an Oscar
If the team had insisted on making Xiaojie into jelly
Made with the technology of the time
It might become a failure
This is about building a network of dissent
Only then can we bring ourselves to rethink
After introducing personal rethinking
Next let’s look at how to lead others to rethink
Management professor Neil Rackham studies the skills of expert negotiators
Found that they all have three characteristics
The first negotiator will spend 1/3 of their efforts on finding common ground.
We usually think we need to win an argument
The key is logic, data, and persuasion skills
But when we try to convince others
would act like a missionary
On the contrary, it will arouse the other party's wariness
In comparison
First approve some of the other person’s ideas
On the contrary, it will make the other party feel that you are not here to cause trouble.
But a reasonable person
really want to discuss things
For example, IBM held a debate in 2019
Let international debate champion Harish Natarajan debate AI
Should the government subsidize kindergartens?
AI can tap into vast databases on the web
Data support can be found at any time
Looks more likely to win
<font color=#FFE900FF>Research clearly shows that a good preschool can help kids overcome the disadvantages often associated with poverty</font> <font color=#FFE900FF>Research clearly shows that a good preschool can help kids overcome the disadvantages
often associated with poverty.</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>The OECD has recommended that government subsidize pre primary education to boost performance in poor areas</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>The OECD has recommended that government subsidize pre primary education to boost performance in poor areas.</font>
But let’s have a look at Harish’s debating skills
<font color=#FFE900FF>If we believe preschools are good in principle, surely it is worth subsidizing them</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>If we believe preschools are good in principle, surely it is worth giving money to subsidize those,</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>But I don't think that is ever enough of a justification for subsidies
.</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>Because there are multiple things which are good for society that could be,
<font color=#FFE900FF>because there are multiple things which are good for society that could be, < /font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>in countries like the United States,</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>Increased investment in health care,
which would often also have returns for education,</font>
<font color=#FFE900FF>
which the OECD would also note is probably very beneficial to deal with poverty.</font>
Harris first agreed with his opponent, saying
The data presented by AI is correct
Subsidized kindergarten does help disadvantaged students
Then argue that such data alone is not enough
Because to deal with poverty you don’t have to subsidize kindergartens
This allowed him to reach a consensus with his opponent first
It's only effective if it's discussed
The second technique for leading others to rethink is
Focus on a single statement to support your point of view
Sometimes there are too many reasons
On the contrary, it gives others more opportunities to find your flaws.
The author once conducted an experiment for the university
Testing how to get stingy alumni to donate
Group A alumni received messages emphasizing altruism
Group B alumni received messages emphasizing self-interest.
It turns out that both messages are equally effective
can get 6.5% of alumni to donate money
But if alumni receive these two messages at the same time
The donation rate dropped to 3% instead
why
Because when you use multiple reasons to convince someone
It feels like a missionary, on purpose
On the contrary, it will arouse people's defensiveness
Instead of supporting your argument with multiple reasons
It's better to use a single statement to feel like a sincere conversation
A third negotiation tip for getting others to think is to avoid using strong words
Use question marks more often to end a sentence
Many negotiators will deliberately express curiosity and say
"So you don't see any merit in this question?"
This kind of question helps the other party get out of the cycle of overconfidence and rethink the issue.
You don’t have to convince the other person that you are right
Just use various questions to open up the other person's curiosity
Invite the other person to question their original ideas
Let their curiosity automatically lead them to the answers
This rethinking of psychology
It also allows us to deal with social discrimination and prejudice issues
Because many prejudices and discriminations are learned silently from childhood.
So we can “unlearn” the prejudices we have received
For example, psychologists have found
Many astronauts who have been to outer space
After returning to Earth, my thinking changed.
they will develop a global consciousness
More concerned about the interests of mankind as a whole
For example, American NASA astronaut Jeffrey Ashby said
People on earth are a community with a shared future
If the atmosphere breaks down, all mankind will suffer together
View of Earth from space
You will feel that everyone on earth is one family
Many international disputes suddenly become unimportant
This is called in psychology
Overview
Effect
When you look at the overview of the entire group from the outside
You will realize that they actually have a lot in common
A classic case that leads the other party to rethink
Daryl Davis, a well-known American black musician
America’s Ku Klux Klan believes in white supremacy
Believes that black people have criminal genes and are the source of social chaos
Daryl Davis actually went to a Ku Klux Klan party
Go head-to-head with these people.
First, ask the other person a question
<font color=#FFF600FF>You don’t even know me yet, how can you hate me? </font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>how can you hate me when you don't even know me?</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>They have never had an answer that they
can come up with that justifies how they can hate me.</font>
First by asking questions
Make the other person question their own point of view
Instead of rushing to change the other person's mind right away
Then find out what the two sides have in common.
Like the music we like together
Make the other person aware of the common humanity behind their skin color
over the past 20 years
Daryl Davis kept talking to the KKK this way
These people discovered many of their prejudices against black people
In fact, I have been instilled in my family since I was a child.
Daryl Davis guides them to rethink their own biases
In the end, more than 200 KKK members changed their views on black people and left the KKK.
<font color=#FFF600FF>I consider frank to be my friend.</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>I consider frank to be my friend.</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>I consider Daryl to be my friend
as well.</font>
This is the psychology of using the other party to rethink.
Finally we look at how to get collectives to rethink
Psychologist Peter Coleman at Columbia University
Set up a Difficult Conversations Laboratory
Pair up two people with opposite opinions to debate
Before the debate, both sides will be given a discussion article on gun control.
The article presents the pros and cons of both sides
There is a 46% chance that the two people will reach a consensus when they discuss it later.
Then do another set of experiments
Allow subjects to see articles that present diverse perspectives
rather than black and white
The result was that 100% of the subjects reached a consensus during the discussion
Subject's conversations were recorded
Play it to them after the experiment is over
turn out
Dialogues that reach consensus and are productive
There will be more diverse emotions
Like anger, curiosity, anxiety
During the conversation, you will constantly revise your feelings.
In comparison
Unproductive conversations tend to be very one-dimensional
Because the discussions are all fixed on the original thinking
This experiment revealed
We thought we were going to get out of the stratosphere
Just listen to different opinions
But this approach
It will probably only strengthen your original thoughts.
Think the other person is stupid
Binary BiasBinary
Bias
It is to simplify complex issues into only the pros and cons.
Human Psychology To facilitate understanding of issues
Binary bias naturally occurs
To avoid this bias, we must restore the original complexity of the issue.
For example, a 2020 survey found
54% of Americans believe the climate crisis is a threat
But 18% of Americans don’t believe there is a climate crisis
The media has a habit of dividing people into two groups
Climate change acknowledgments and climate change deniers
But there are actually 6 species in the United States alone
Climate skeptics are not the same as climate change deniers
They will read scientific information
And then said he doubted these results
Believe that doubt is the spirit of scientific research
But the voices of these skeptics are often ignored
Climate scientists would classify them as deniers
It is unscientific to say that they are all the same.
This prevents real dialogue
And on the other end of the spectrum
Although most climate scientists acknowledge the climate crisis
But these people look the same
In fact, the solutions they proposed are also very different.
So if the 6 positions on the spectrum are faithfully presented
In fact, it will increase the complexity of the discussion.
This is not conducive to media coverage
So the media can only simplify them into two groups: those who support and those who oppose climate science.
Another example is in the world of psychology
Daniel Goleman proposed the term emotional intelligence EQ
<font color=#FFF600FF>Emotional intelligence refers to
how well we handle ourselves and our relationships.</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>Self-awareness. Knowing
what we're feeling, why we're feeling it,</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>which is a basis of
, for example, good intuition, good decision-making.</font>
suddenly became very popular
Many companies have begun to believe that EQ is more important than IQ when recruiting employees.
Later in 2016
Another psychologist, Jordan Peterson, wrote an article rebutting
Said there is no such thing as EQ
This is just a self-marketing scam by psychologists
The psychology community has not yet decided how to measure EQ.
This is just a false concept conceived by psychologists who want to make companies care more about their voices
<font color=#FFEF00FF>You always hear that emotional intelligence is needed to succeed in the workplace, right? </font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>You know how you always hear you need emotional intelligence to thrive in a workplace?</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>In fact, it's exactly the other way around.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Turns out that it's exactly backwards.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>Disagreeable people do better as managers
in the workplace.</font>
<font color=#FFEF00FF>So it's actually
if you lack EQ you're more likely to be an effective manager .</font>
So who is right and who is wrong in this debate?
the author thinks
In fact the situation is more complicated
The psychology community recognizes the existence of EQ
EQ is a predictive factor in experiments
But this does not mean that the other school’s view is correct.
EQ is not really more important than IQ
It depends on the nature of the work
Jobs such as service industry and business running
EQ will be more important than IQ
So this debate
Both sides got some things right, and both sides got some things wrong.
Restore the complexity of things to their original appearance
To break the cycle of overconfidence
inspire people to rethink
Finally, let’s collectively rethink
A culture of collective learning must be established
This usually starts with leaders
Like many university professors teaching the same subject every year
The syllabus also follows last year’s
The teacher himself didn’t even think about it again.
How can we ask students to rethink?
Robert Nozick, a philosopher at Harvard University in the United States, insists on teaching a new course every year
He has taught various classes
Truth, Neuroscience, Socrates, and the Russian Revolution
to him
Open a class that you haven’t taught before
It’s an opportunity to study with students
The author himself is a professor of psychology
He will be on course planning
I intentionally left the last lesson blank.
Have students discuss in groups and put forward their own ideas
See what you want to take in the last class
This requires students to rethink
What do you want to get from this course?
Don’t passively receive the teacher’s knowledge
But take the initiative to learn
The author also served as an advisor to the Bill Gates Foundation
to help their organizations build psychological safety
Because although there are professionals in various fields in the team,
But everyone is afraid that if they say the wrong thing, they will offend Bill Gates.
lead people in the team
They don’t dare to come up with bold ideas
The author did an experiment
Let the management of Group A proactively ask employees
How you can improve your company
This can improve psychological safety in the short term
But there is no way to last
Because there are always some supervisors who don’t like to hear criticism
Supervisors in Group B were asked to share with employees that the team had benefited from employees’ criticism.
Publicly acknowledge that there are areas where the company can improve
This is equivalent to showing employees
Supervisors can take criticism
In other words, showing weakness is normalized.
When superiors are willing to show their weaknesses
The team’s psychological safety will actually increase
Because they feel their superiors make mistakes too
Progress is also needed
Later, the author was inspired by Jimmy Kimmel's talk show
There is a segment where artists are asked to read out tweets criticizing them on Twitter.
<font color=#FFF600FF>Elizabeth Olsen has super weird fingers</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>It’s true, I have weird hands</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>Has anyone noticed that Samuel Jackson looks like a snapping turtle?</font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>No offense, but why does Anderson Cooper make me think of dinosaurs? </font>
<font color=#FFF600FF>It’s your fault</font>
The author also uses this trick in organizational management
Employees can write down what they dislike about the company on the card
The supervisor takes the initiative to read it out and admit where he can improve
This ritual helps reduce the superior's sense of authority
This is when leaders take the lead themselves
Lead the team to rethink
Today's video
We introduce the psychology of disruptive thinking
The first is individual rethinking
Remember, your opinions do not define your self-identity
Beware of the Dak Effect
Overconfidence in yourself may reflect your ignorance
It’s good to find mistakes and correct them
Just the opportunity to correct my thinking
Let’s get into the rethinking of interpersonal relationships
Find common ground behind differences of opinion
Instead of using multiple arguments
Why not use a main argument to discuss it?
Don’t spend time convincing the other person to believe you
Instead, practice listening to each other better.
Use questions to get the other person to rethink
Finally, a collective rethink
Give a complex look to controversial topics
Instead of choosing one from the black and white right or wrong questions
Create a culture of active learning
Leaders themselves must be able to accept doubts and challenges
Only then can we lead the group to create a sense of psychological safety.
Lead the entire team to rethink
If you want to know more about the psychology of subversive thinking
Then read this book "Reverse Thinking" together
Let you break the rules and reflect boldly
