Oppenheimer was a man with a very divided self and an insecure self he never quite pulled himself together as a human being and as is true with many people with that kind of personality structure he was a superb actor he could play lots of different roles and he did women adored him he was one of the most lavish quarters of women he would bring a bouquet of flowers to their first date which was apparently shocking to people in those days he would he was just a lovely courtly man but in the classroom if somebody made a stupid mistake he would just chew them out and he was nasty to people all the time in a way that bothered a lot of people Louis Alvarez who was someone I got to know pretty well because I helped him write his Memoirs when one of the important scientists that L Alamos really didn't get along with with Oppenheimer at all because Oppenheimer was so condescending to everyone and Larry was kind of a hotthead and he didn't like people condescending to him Oppenheimer never want to know Bill Louie did and so forth so there was this layer of Oppenheimer being waspish all the time which was his insecurity and his insecurity extended to physics and that rather than dig deep into one problem Robbie said later he just he didn't have the zits Flash he couldn't sit down and focus on one problem because he always wanted to be someone who always knew everything that was going on in his in physics well you could call that someone who who was a very sophisticated knowledgeable scientist you call him a uh someone who was superficial and he was superficial he knew broadly rather than deeply if you will and for the period of the war Hans bet told me this he said before the war Robert really could be cruel uh he would pounce on a mistake you made and beta Nobel lauran of beta discovered what makes the sun work that's how important beta's work was and how significant beta told me and of course everyone makes mistakes I made mistakes upen Hammer would would charge me with the mistake if I spoke wrong but he said before the war after the war but not during the war during the war he was the superb kind of wise lab director because unlike most scientist he was not only a physicist of of high class but he really was psychologically astute as a human being as I think insecure people often are because got to scope out what's going on when the war was over these were mostly graduate students of new phds who had been recruited for this program the average age at Los Alamos was 27 Oppenheimer was an old guy he was 39 right so these were young guys who' been pulled out of their lives pulled out of their careers they wanted to get back to the university and do the work they had started out to do and by and large they did unless alen was just emptied out teller was horrified tell her wanted the bomb program to continue because he wanted to build his hydrogen bomb it was it's going to be his his his bid for history just as oppenheimer's bid for history was the fishing bomb if you will tellers was going to be the hydrogen bomb you talked to teller in writing the book is that right I did what was his feelings when you talked to him about this I made the mistake of going to see teller at his house on the grounds of Stanford University early on in my research when I really didn't didn't have as clear a grasp of who everyone was and what I should ask and so forth and I sent him a copy of a essay I'd written about Robert opheim for a magazine and that set him off he he had reached the point where he was telling TV interviewers asking them how much time he would actually be on the air and if they said three minutes or whatever he would say all right then I will answer three questions no more trying to control because he was convinced that everyone was cutting the story to make him look bad he really had quite a lot of paranoia at that point in his life so when he read my essay on Oppenheimer he used that as the basis for basically shouting at me waving my big heavy book one of my big heavy books at him I remember thinking oh my God he's going to hit me with my book then I thought wait a minute this guy's 80 years old can take him so but he finally said all right I will answer three questions and we sat down and I asked him why and he didn't give me an interesting answer I asked him the second question and it was worth the whole interview I said was Robert Oppenheimer a good lab director and I thought well here's a chance where he'll slash him but his worst oppenheimer's worst enemy said to me Robert Oppenheimer was the best lab director I ever knew and I thought Bingo and then he chased me out of the house so you know Eisenhower in one of his Memoirs says I always liked Hannibal best of all the classical figures in the military of the Roman Empire because he comes down to us only in the written Memoirs of his enemies and if they thought he was such a good leader yeah he must have been a hell of a leader
