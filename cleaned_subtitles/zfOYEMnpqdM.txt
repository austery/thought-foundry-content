another topic I know you studied a lot is how one might mind a black hole oh yeah right I read a paper about that very good yeah um tell me about it okay so uh what do you may mean by m black hole M black hole means take the energy out of a black hole that used to be in a black hole obviously if our distant descendants have used up all of the energy and stars and everything else uh the black hole might be the last thing they turn their ey to so can you get energy out of black holes at all uh the old story pre 1970s is no like it's just black hole there one way matter Falls in it never comes out it's stuck uh the thing that Hawking and beckenstein discovered in the 70s is that once quantum mechanics is involved that's not true anymore once quantum mechanics is involved in fact energy even without you doing anything starts to leave black holes uh the problem as far as our assistant descendants will be concerned is that it leaves black holes extremely slowly so if you took a solar mass black hole same mass as the sun just collapsed to form a black hole there'll be this little Quantum what's called Hawking radiation nowadays little Quantum Hawking radiation in which the energy will leech out again very very slowly and the temperature of a of a solar mass black hole is measured in nanin so very low temperature and that's bad news because it means the energy comes out super duper slowly a solar mass black hole if you don't help it will take about 10 to the 55 times the current age of the universe to have given out all its energy back into the universe can you make that faster the mining question is can you speed that up and there was this proposal that you could going to reach in with a mechanical claw obviously not crossing the Horizon because otherwise you've lost the Chaw and you're somewhat counterproductive but like just just outside the Horizon just grab some of that Hawking radiation and just drag it a long way away from the black hole and then and then Feast on it or do whatever it is you want to do with it now from one point of view that's just like a space elevator or all be at a very high performance space elevator space elevators you'll remember are these ideas for how we might get things off the surface of the Earth without using Rockets and the idea is that you have uh some massive orbiting object sort of very long way away Beyond geostationary orbit and then you dangle off that rope down to the surface of the Earth and then you can essentially just climb up the Rope to get out that's a space elevator idea and already around Earth it it's hitting pretty hard Material Science constraints the trouble with making a space elevator isn't so much supporting the payload that you're trying to have climb up it is merely just the Rope supporting its own weight because each bit of the Rope needs to support not only its own weight but also the weight of all of the Rope beneath it uh so the tension that you require keeps getting more and more and more as you as you go up at the bottom there is no tension effect it doesn't even touch the Earth it's not like a compression structure that's like a skyscraper that's pushed up from below it's a tension structure that's held up from above uh but as you go up because the T you need more and more tension you also need to make the Rope thicker and thicker and thicker and if you try and on Earth or around Earth build a space elevator out of steel say it just doesn't work steel is not strong enough uh you need to keep doubling the thickness until by the time you get to geostationary orbit the thickness of the steel rope is more than the size of the Earth like the whole thing just doesn't just doesn't work at all uh but carbon nanot tubes are this material that we just we' discovered that are much stronger than steel so in fact around Earth carbon nanot tubes will just about work if we can make them long enough and pure enough and uh then they will be strong enough we will be able to build a space elevat around Earth in you know maybe sometime in the next next Century that you only need a couple of doublings of the thickness of the carbon nanot tubes uh along its entire entire length so carbon nanot tubes work great around Earth but they are totally inadequate for black holes for black holes you know the CR the critical Material Science property you need for this for this rope is the tensile strength to mass per unit length ratio IO it needs to be strong high tensil strength but low weight like Light low mass per unit length and that's the critical ratio and carbon nanot tubes is you know 10 the minus uh 12 or something on that on that scale and that is simply not strong enough at all uh in fact what I showed in my paper is that you need a tensil strength the weight ratio that is as strong as is consistent with the laws of nature so in fact the laws of nature bound this quantity the finiteness of the speed of light means you cannot have an arbitrarily strong rope with a given mass per unit length there is a bound set by the C squ uh in some in some units that bounds the maximum possible tensol strength that any rope can have any rope in fact that has that an example of a rope that has that is a string so a string is um I mean a fundamental string from string theory is an example of a hypothetical rope that is just strong enough to to violate to saturate that bound that strength bound and then the problem is is the following the problem is that if you have a rope uh that saturates the bound as strong as any rope can be uh it is just strong enough to support all of its own weight with exactly no strength left over to support any payload it might wish to carry and that's ultimately what Dooms these mining black holes you know these rapid mining black hole proposals okay so we can't get the material out of the black hole in a at a pace that would make it like reasonably useful to us what can we do with black holes what what are they good for if you have a small black hole uh you can get stuff out of them uh more rapidly the the temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional size so one thing that people have talked about with black holes is using them to extract all of the energy from matter as you know most chemical reactions are pretty inefficient you you you burn gasoline and you extract as a as a function of the rest mass of the gasoline that that you started with you extract one part in 10 billion of of energy from the from the gasoline that you started with so that that's bad from the point of view you know you have MC squ worth in in a gallon of gasoline you've got a full MC squared worth of energy in there and you can only get out one part in 10 10 that's a pretty unsatisfactory situation roughly speaking the reason that all chemical processes are so in efficient uh is that they only address the electromagnetic energy in the electrons and very small fraction of the electromagnetic energy in an electron in in atoms is stored in the electromagnetic interaction between the between the electrons and between the nucleus and the electrons most of it is stored in the nucleus itself in the strong nuclear forces and particularly in the rest mass of the protons and neutrons that constitute it so you could do much better if instead of doing electromagnetic interactions you use nuclear interactions that that can probe the energy in uh turning protons into neutrons that's why nuclear power plants are so much more efficient on a per Mass basis than chemical power plants like coal plants or or gas plants uh because you're getting a much higher fraction you you know best case scenario you're getting one part in 10 the three um or 10 the four of the rest mass of the uranium that you start with uh you're extracting as energy but even there uh in even in that process uh it's still only you know absolute best one part in a thousand of the rest mass and the reason is that you are using where much more of the energy is stored which is the strong and weak interactions between the protons and the neutrons so much more is available to you but still at the end of whatever the process you finish with there there's a number that'll be conserved and that is the What's called the barrial number so it's the total number of protons plus the total number of neutrons you can transmute protons into neutrons or vice versa in in nuclear processes which is partti of the reason they're so much more uh use much more better energy than things that just affect the chemistry but still uh most of the energy is stored in the rest mass of the protons and the neutrons and you want to get that and nuclear processes conserve that um beta Decay will maybe turn a proton into a neutron or vice versa but the total number of protons plus neutrons is not changing and so therefore 19 9.9% of the energy is inaccessible to you so what you need to do to get that energy and try and get most of the MC squ out of the matter that you have what you need to do is is use a process that eats paron number that can in which you can start off with a proton or a neutron and end up with no Proton or Neutron and instead all of that energy Unleashed in high energy radiation that you can use for purposes so electromagnetic interactions won't do that strong interactions also won't do that weak interactions won't do that the only force of nature that will do that um with a small caveat the only force of nature that that we know that will do that is the gravitational interaction and so you it is a property of black holes that you can stand outside the black hole and throw protons and neutrons into the black holes and then it'll process it uh and then spit out photons at the end in Hawking radiation and and and gravitons which is going to be slightly annoying to have to capture and and neutros but like they're there in principle uh and in principle you could capture them so one thing that black holes might be technologically useful for in the future is you start off with a much smaller black hole than uh than what I've just than uh the size of the sun be very careful about making sure it doesn't grow and yeah you could be super duper careful um and throw in protons and neutrons uh and then get out photons and in principle if you could capture the everything that's emitted from the black hole including the gravitons and the in the neutrinos uh that gets rid of the barrier number conservation problem and allows you to build power plants that approach 100% efficiency and by 100% I mean uh not the way we measure gas turbine efficiency where we talk about the total available chemical energy in the gas I mean 100% of the MC squar of the entire gas you're you're putting in
