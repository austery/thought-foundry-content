Hi Malala, I'm Anna.
>> Today I'm speaking to Malala Yusfsai. Malala became a feminist and political icon at 15 years old after a member of the Taliban tried to assassinate her while she was riding the school bus. She was targeted for saying that girls should have the right to go to school.
>> When I see my school in this way, so I'm very shameful of my army.
>> At 16, she wrote a memoir about the experience. And at 17, she won the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the youngest person to ever win that award. For years, the world has known her as this extraordinary young activist. But now, she has a new memoir out. It's called Finding My Way. And in it, she talks about learning to do ordinary things, make friends, find her personal style, go to parties, study for exams, even fall in love. From the New York Times, I'm Anna Martin. This is Modern Love. Malala, welcome to Modern Love.
>> Thank you.
>> We are so happy that you're in the studio with us. Congratulations on your new memoir, Finding My Way.
>> Thank you so much. I'm so excited.
>> You are now a double memoirist.
>> Yes.
>> Will you make it a third a triple memoir in a couple years or is this enough for
>> Oh, I just want to focus on this one for now.
>> That makes sense. How many memoirs can one person write? Do you think there's a limit?
>> I think people know when it's time to write one.
>> I actually waited for this one. Um, I was asked by so many people, why don't you write another book? And I was like, about what? Like, who wants to write if there's nothing meaningful? But the timing of Finding My Way, uh, my new memoir just felt right. And I knew there was something to share that is meaningful to people.
>> Tell me more about how you knew the moment was right to begin writing. I love that that you waited even though people were clamoring. It sounds like, how did you know the time was right?
>> I was reflecting on how I had become a young woman. M
>> I was known in the public eye as a girl who was shot by the Taliban at age 15. And I was still meeting people who would see me as that girl
>> and I wanted to reintroduce myself beyond those titles, beyond those headlines. And I wanted to show that now I have experienced much more. I had this incredible time at college. I made incredible friends. I had my first love. I am married. I have been going through other challenges and difficulties from like mental health to even coming to a decision about marriage itself. But this is all a part of me and activism is of course the mission of my life. But you know I
>> I'm I'm more than that as well and I wanted to share the personal story. So these are you know these are the true reflections of of me. This is, I think, very important and part of the reason I I loved this book so much is, you know, you're you are so immediately recognizable, right? Your name, your face, your work. And I loved how this book, it talks about big things certainly, but at the same time, there were all of these small, ordinary, everyday details about your life that I thought just added such dimension. I felt very grateful that you were sharing those things with us. I think we see this perfect image of everybody on social media or the way people usually tell their story is um like you know they somehow knew how to figure it all out. But I had to be very honest that
>> I was actually very shy at school. I was so scared that I will never be able to make any friends. So in college of course I was you know there because I I wanted to study at Oxford but more than anything I just wanted to make friends. M I did not want to feel alone anymore. Before you went to college, when you were a teenager, it seemed to me reading this book that you had quite a serious life, right? You're flying to speak with world leaders and and be on panels. You're doing public activism work.
>> What was it like for you to be doing all of this stuff
>> so young and so close to the attack? What was that like? When I look back, I feel very different because now I see how I had somehow accepted the global recognition I was given.
>> And I felt like people were defining me when I was still in a coma.
>> They were calling me brave, courageous, an activist,
>> speaks truth to power, all of that. And I was like, "Wow, I'm I'm 15. I have to start my school again and figure out my life in a new country in in the UK.
>> Um, so much to process yet this is now the the mission of my life.
>> Somehow I was forcing myself to accept that.
>> In school, I had like literally no friends. I only made best friend, one best friend by the end of my school time. Um, I would still talk to my old friends from Pakistan, have those long uh calls with them
>> and the rest of my time I was either with the family at home or I would be traveling doing speeches and conferences. So, my exposure was very limited. I actually had not seen boys my age
>> cuz you went to an all girls school.
>> I went to an all girls school and it was like just older people.
>> They weren't so amazing at age 15. I'll just share that as someone who was around. No, then I I found out when I went to like wasn't missing anything. Yeah.
>> No, I was like, "Oh, I'm I'm glad I saw it." And then now I now I know. But
>> they smell kind of weird, don't you think?
>> A lot of things. I think that could be a different podcast for us.
>> But it was just this feeling that um you know, I was not living the the life a child should be living at age 15. So at college like much later when I was not being watched by my parents when I felt I could be myself and there are not these work people after me asking me to do this and that and I thought I had just more control over like my life. That's when I was like, "Okay, I'm gonna like, you know, just hang out, do these crazy things. Somebody wants me to climb the rooftop, I will. Late night, we're going to get to that. I will."
>> Uh, yeah. I think it's I thought that college would be just this limited time of my life where I get to do anything I want and then after that maybe I'll just go back to the old, you know, serious life. But I was like, this is that time, the three years where I'm studying at Oxford. Maybe I can be more adventurous.
>> Right. Before you go to Oxford, this moment in the book tickled me so much. You're trying to figure out what to pack, what to wear.
>> Yes.
>> Because your mom had chosen your outfits, right?
>> Yes.
>> Do you remember? I mean, of course, it's your life, but why don't you share what you did in order to figure out, you know, what what to pack? I loved this detail.
>> I know. I love my mom, but she's a very strict mom and she was always deciding what I should be wearing. Same for university. She said, "Let me pack everything for you." So, it was, you know, traditional dresses, shelvaramies. And my mom always got me a size bigger than mine somehow. And it it's just no sense of fashion. None of that for me.
>> Much love, mom, though. We'll say
>> I know. I know. But for me at university, it was about me feeling like every other student. And I did not want to stand out because of course when I wear my shvaramies the traditional Pakistani dress I do stand out and people have seen me in the public eye in those outfits. So, I wanted to just wear a jumper, just jeans,
>> sweater. Again, I'm decoding sweater,
>> trousers, um, a hoodie, pants. Oh my goodness.
>> Now, it's become kind of a bid, but the UK, you No, it's totally fine. I'm I'm translating for them so they'll understand.
>> Very very casual clothes that you just assimilate and and you're you're like any other student. That's what I wanted. I was like, I just want to be a normal student.
>> So, yeah, my mom would put a Pakistani dress. I would remove it and put in a jumper and somehow I I found a way out through that and I took these, you know, more casual clothes and my search on Google at the time was Selena Gomez 2017 casual outfits.
>> Was it like a lot of infinity scarves? Do you remember those things?
>> Yes. And just like those long um sort of gemstone kind of necklaces.
>> We were so It look like chandeliers.
>> Yeah.
>> Why were we dressing like that?
>> I know. too many scarves around their neck.
>> So many infinity scarf when it wasn't even cold, I will say.
>> No, no, but I want to forget all of those outfits that I wore once. I was like, "Okay,
>> we should move on. We should move on."
>> So, you get to Oxford with a suitcase full of Selena Gomez casual.
>> Yes.
>> Who were the people you were drawn to as friends?
>> Wow. I I was exploring um the whole university. I was saying hello to almost everybody because there was no criteria for me. I wanted to meet as many people. There were incredible people in my subject group. Every friend was unique in their own way
>> and we had a lot in common but also very different experiences in terms of our background where we had come from. There was always something to talk about and always something to learn. when you were with friends,
>> they made Oxford life more fun for me because this was a time when I was not being asked about what was it like meeting that president and so what do you do through Malala Fund? It was about how was your essay last week? Wasn't that question so hard? Did you figure it out? This tutor is like so annoying or can we skip this lecture please? Yeah. Yeah.
>> These were the conversations and that's exactly what I wanted. I wanted to be a student. I wanted to be uh treated as a friend. And all of these people, the incredible friends I made at Oxford made me feel like I was their friend
>> and I felt so secure with them, not being judged. And
>> yeah, this was the most precious thing from college. You are making friends. You're doing all these, you know, totally normal college activities.
>> Yes.
>> And yet you do have a security detail that follows you on campus. And I wasn't exactly clear in that. Are they quite literally everywhere with you? Just a few steps behind or how was that?
>> Yeah, they're following you. They are uh non-uniform and they want to keep it as normal for you as they can.
>> Sure. But there is a point where your friends are like, "We see these strangers behind you every day. Are you okay? Are they following you?" And I'm like, "No, no, they're just taking care of me. Don't worry."
>> They would come to like parties and stuff.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay, that's fine.
>> Yeah. I mean,
>> some older guys at the party. It's fine.
>> Quite older.
>> Yeah. Quite older. They could blend in. You also got up to some mischief in college in the dead of night. Tell me about that.
>> Yeah. So in college I found out about rooftop climbing and this is some like a secret thing that these students do um where they're like we want to get in trouble. So in our college um at Oxford there is the bell tower
>> y
>> and it's not easy to get up there so you have to go up to the top uh
>> yeah describe it for me in case I want to ever go to Oxford and sort of climb this.
>> I think you should not do that. I think it's not allowed anymore, but if you know,
>> so you go up to the top floor of the main Talbert Hall,
>> okay?
>> And you get into this small room there, and there's a small window, and you open that window, you sneak out through the window, and there is this narrow um roof um path, but it's very narrow. getting soious, but keep going. Yes,
>> you could put like one foot at a time basically like
>> like show me with your hands how narrow is it.
>> Don't you even say that
>> it's very narrow. It's it's basically like the roofs sort of the the edge, you know, the side
>> you're clinging on basically.
>> And there's like another part where you sort of have to like jump. Now this next part of the the roof, it's very scary. So I had like I had that mysterious friend who took me there and and they like you know were helping me and so they jumped before and then I jumped after.
>> It's night right?
>> It's it's midnight. It's very late at night.
>> Are there lights around? Describe it. So and and put me in that moment with you the first time. So it's dark outside. You're looking out right about to take that jump. What's going through your mind?
>> It's very dark in the college. It's quiet and I felt like it was just me who was in control of what was happening and we were about to climb the rooftop. It was a very risky journey because you're walking on these very narrow uh path of the roof and one misstep you will fall from the fourth floor of the building. I don't think you will survive.
>> So then you go up to the bell tower and you sort of sit in there and you could see, you know, the the bell uh
>> above you and it's just so beautiful. You look down, you could see the whole college. You're wondering who's doing what in their room. Some have their lights on and some might be sleeping right now. You look at the library who's still studying at midnight and and you look down and you're like, hm, are these the the college security? I hope they're not looking for you. Um and um I had just told my security that night that I was, you know, done with everything. You guys can go to bed. So I was just looking at sort of their room as well,
>> feeling alone
>> and hoping that um they do not suddenly wake up and look for me.
>> It was a moment where I felt so close to nature, so close to myself. I could hear my my heart and it was just a magical beautiful moment and there I was sitting with a stranger just doing something that uh I should not have been doing.
>> But I was okay to get in trouble. I wanted to try things without feeling like anybody was watching me, anybody was judging me or commenting about me. It sounds too dramatic when I talk about it, but it was
>> truly a moment when I felt um that I am living the true college experience.
>> It is to me a really profound moment of like reckoning and introspection for you, right? And you spoke about how you'd accepted this role other people had put you into and certainly that you'd also stepped into on your own with your work and your fund. But this is a thing and I say this with utmost, you know, care. It's a stupid thing to do because it's so far up. But it's like you're doing it because you want to, right?
>> You're doing it because you're like, "Let's do it."
>> Yeah. And that was my first time, but not my last time.
>> And why would you keep doing it? It's it's really hard to explain. Um
>> trying climbing to the rooftop made me connect to a part of me that I thought had gone missing.
>> And I was a very adventurous person growing up in Pakistan. I loved to try new things. I was adventurous. And you know when my life took a sharp turn and I started a new life in a new country I just thought I could never connect back to that old self or I would just never know what I would have been like if none of these things had happened if I hadn't been attacked if I hadn't started this activist life um in a new place that when I was in college and when I was climbing rooftops I felt like I was connecting ing with that old part of me. With time, I have become that person that I I try new things. I don't care if I do it wrong or if I get judged for it or what people think about it. With time, you just realize you have to live your life.
>> And you can't just dictate yourself or do this self-sabotage on yourself where you feel like you are expected to live your life a certain way. And if you do it otherwise then somehow you are not satisfying the expectations. So college was a time when I was slowly testing it.
>> I mean what you're saying is is really important. I think it wasn't so much a discovery of a part of yourself. It was rediscovery.
>> Yes. Yes. Now this is a cheesy question but bear with me. I I wonder and you can feel free to say no, but when you were up there, did you picture younger you, the one who had that adventurous spark? Yes, I could see the younger Malala. I am not a person who thinks too much about the past because my life has changed so much that if I put myself in that place where I'm thinking what it could have been like is like you can you can never be satisfied with imagining your life differently. So in college rather than thinking too much about what it would have been like if I were here as you know just that normal student and with no recognition and people had knew nothing about me and they were maybe not like watching me and it felt like that and I'm not saying that you know people are actually watching you and people are actually commenting about you sometimes they do that's sometimes how the social media world appears.
>> You have a level of scrutiny on you.
>> It's also how you feel. It's how how because it affects you so much. I you know I usually say it doesn't affect me or it shouldn't. I agree with that. I don't let it affect my work but in the end the truth is yes it does even if you are trying to fight it back or try to not let it distract you but it is somehow influencing you.
>> You mean this sort of people watching you this this feeling? Yes.
>> Yes. So in college I felt like the the eyes were were not on me.
>> Wow. and I was in my own secret world and I thought I I don't know how I'm supposed to be but I'm going to experience these these uh these things these emotions uh and that will tell me something about myself.
>> I'm going to jump.
>> I'm going to jump. I'm going to climb. I'm going to swim. No, I can't swim.
>> No swimming. I appreciate that your book doesn't paint too rosy a picture of of college, right? You were having these this freedom and you were going to parties and you had these friends and you were pulling all nighters, but you also dealt with
>> some quite difficult stuff.
>> Can you describe, you do this so vividly in the book. Can you describe the first time you had what you later found out was a panic attack?
>> Yes. So I this panic attack was a life-changing moment because I was attacked at age 15. I healed from a bullet and I thought the recovery is done. But many years later when I had the first uh panic attack or the trauma or the flashbacks of what had happened, it made me feel like everything was coming back as if it had never gone. I felt like I was reliving those moments. So it happened um you know at this one night where initially it felt like a normal night because I was working on my essay and I had uh you know an essay crisis. I was struggling. So this friend called me to the college gardens and
>> she said, "Yeah, let's hang out. Some friends are here."
>> I was like, "Maybe she might just give me her notes." So let's go and see her. I go there. We are chatting. And I see this thing for the first time and it's called bong.
>> It's bong, right?
>> It's a bong and it's, you know, basically weed and uh but you know, it's a different way of uh inhaling it.
>> Totally.
>> It is tricky. I will also say
>> it's tricky and I had no idea how to take it and what it was and how quickly it affects you but my friends seemed fine and on the first attempt I coughed and then on the second attempt I felt I inhaled it and it went all in.
>> Yeah.
>> And I don't know where time went but that was the turning point. It felt like a sharp turn where immediately like my body froze. I could not understand time or the surrounding anymore. And I thought I was reliving the attack that I could see the gunman that I was experiencing that near-death experience where I felt like you know maybe I am dead maybe this is afterlife. Am I alive or not? I just lost sense of reality. I had many panic attacks after that. My body would be sweating. I would be shaking. My heart would be throbbing. I could not sleep. Um, as soon as I would try to close my eyes, I felt like it was a nightmare again and I would die. It was so scary. I thought nobody would understand it. I could not even talk to anybody about this because how do you explain to somebody that I'm experiencing all of this? And yeah, like an attack happened many years ago and I was completely normal yesterday. Like I never thought this would happen. And it was so unexpected.
>> Yeah.
>> I'm so glad my friends were there for me. They helped me in this time. They could not explain it to me. They they were not like my therapists,
>> but
>> they they did small things like sharing meals with me or doing a sleepover. Like their sleepover was everything. That was the first time I could actually fall asleep for the first time.
>> They have no idea, but they I'll always remember that. And then in the end it was uh another friend of mine who told me that I should see a therapist.
>> I was so skeptical.
>> Had you seen a therapist up to that point?
>> No. The first time I had seen a therapist briefly was at the hospital in Birmingham when I was recovering from the bullet injury.
>> Immediately after.
>> Yes. At the time I had to go through so many other surgeries for the physical body recovery that I thought what is this person asking me? How do I feel? Like come on. Like look at look at me. I'm recovering. Um what has feelings got to do with any of that? I felt work keep me I felt work kept me busy and distracted.
>> Yeah. And I just had no idea that something like this Bong experience could trigger and bring back the trauma and PTSD. All of these things I had heard of, but I just never understood what that actually means when you experience it. Um, so when I had my first therapy session, it was um a crazy experience because I was telling everything to the therapist and I was hoping that she would give me the medication or whatever cure they have,
>> right? And soon I realized that that's not how it works. You have to accept and embrace it.
>> That now this is a part of you. You cannot banish it magically.
>> Yeah.
>> With time it can get smaller and smaller and it will affect you less and less. But you have to be willing to accept and live with it. I no longer see it as yeah like four sessions or 10 sessions. I think the problem will be fixed by then.
>> Exactly. I mean, I really appreciate you sharing it that that
>> it is so it was terrifying even reading about it. I mean, it really was.
>> You know, it strikes me just as you're talking like we spoke about this roof um experience experiences
>> as this moment of discovering that your past was still with you.
>> Yeah. And I'm realizing that this panic attack was also the sort of like the shadow side of that right with the past with the sort of more full embrace of the past is not just you know the adventures and the you know that that spirit it's also it's also the attack.
>> Yes. And I think that's the part maybe that frustrated me the most
>> because when you are labeled as a brave girl who has overcome an attack and is not afraid of the Taliban and suddenly this moment where you're witnessing that moment of fear again and you feel the gunmen are right in front of you again or you feel you have lost your life again. Um it's it's scary but it's also embarrassing. Like I was feeling embarrassed a bit
>> that somehow I had failed in meeting that label of being brave and courageous.
>> Um I was in South Africa for this campaign that we're doing for Afghan women. I was giving the Nelson Mandela lecture and we were you know bringing attention to what's happening in Afghanistan under the Taliban since they took power four years ago is a gender apartheite like it is systemic oppression. Anyway, that was, you know, a visit there. I gave a speech and there I also had a panic attack.
>> Oh my gosh. Like on stage or or off?
>> No, it was like after I had done all the events, the press, the speeches, there was like nothing triggering and just all of a sudden when I went to bed in the middle of the night, I I just felt like I was I I felt I could not breathe anymore.
>> And my husband was with me. He helped me through the whole night, but I was shaking. I was shivering. recently.
>> Uh yeah, just like a few years ago. Wow.
>> But just to say that you know even in moments when I go on the stage and give a speech to stand up for women and I say that we are not afraid of the extremists and then I go you know back to my room and that night like I'm shaking I'm shivering because I'm having a panic attack and I don't understand because yet like in inside me I know I can continue this fight and I will keep on doing it but physically ally and mentally my body is responding in a way that I have no control on. But that doesn't stop me from doing what I want to do. I will advocate for the rights of Afghan women and girls. We will stand up to all extremists including the Taliban. We will have a better future for women and girls when they can just choose their own future like whatever they want. Just having more freedom and liberation.
>> But it's not an easy journey and we have to be honest about it. how it can overwhelm us, how it can affect our own mental health. And um so I'm I'm sharing just a part of that in my book.
>> It's powerful and I and I appreciate you sharing it with me here and I I think of this word you used embarrassing.
>> Yeah.
>> Can you tell me more about that word because it I think I understand but it's a harsh word to to sort of turn on yourself and I wonder about that. Why did it feel embarrassing to have a panic attack?
>> It felt embarrassing because I thought I had failed in meeting up the expectation of being brave and strong. When people tell you that you stood up to the Taliban, how did you do that? How could you be so brave? I did not even have an answer to that. I would just simply say education is my right. Why should anyone take it away from me? And now like many years later when I had these panic attacks and I was just like suddenly scared. It's not that the Taliban were standing right in front of me but I felt it.
>> Yeah.
>> It's something I wish like I can just make disappear. But that is to say that it is still brave when you are embarrassed when you are scared when you are afraid but you still get up and do what you believe in. I think that is true bravery.
>> I want to get us into this zone of of talking about romance and dating and love because it's a it's a beautiful part of your book as well. You mentioned that you just weren't around guys so much before you went to college and then you were around them. Where was your confidence in terms of dating boys, romance?
>> I was more of a coach at the beginning.
>> Yeah. When it came to love life conversations, I was giving advice to my friends, you know, like if a guy is not replying to your text for 3 days, it
>> not that that's happening to me, but what do you think it means?
>> He doesn't want to talk like, you know, and I don't think he deserves you like it's
>> hear that.
>> Yeah. you know, like anyway,
>> and and my friends were just so shocked that I knew so much about guys and dating. And I told them, I have never dated a guy. I don't even know what that is. But
>> I would sometimes just joke with them that I'm more of a coach than a player.
>> And the coaches know more than the players.
>> You're observing.
>> Observing.
>> You were you had taken yourself off the field to continue that metaphor.
>> And and really that actually is the language I'd use. taken yourself sort of out of the game. Can you describe why? Why was dating not so much on your radar?
>> There were two reasons for that. One was more my personal decision and the second one was cultural.
>> Yeah.
>> When I was attacked by the Taliban, the bullet uh caused injuries including my hearing loss and also my facial symmetry. So I had become very insecure. I thought like my smile was never the same and you know like the facial symmetry wasn't there anymore. I received so many surgeries to work on repairing the facial nerve. Even my last surgery was to to do that. And I thought like, oh, you know, like to grapple with it, the best way is to just say never date a guy or and if I'm honest, I just thought like nobody would like me and all of that. But it was that's just a whole different thinking.
>> Yeah.
>> And then on the other hand, it was also the cultural pressure because in our culture in Pakistan,
>> like girls are not allowed to date.
>> Sure. Um it's different in the cities but in a lot of the villages in most of Pakistan girls are even punished for it
>> if they're found dating or texting a guy. And you know there's like crazy things like honor killings and uh so I thought okay like that's supposed to be a bad thing and why put my family in trouble? Why make my mom and dad angry? um even though I knew we were now in a different country and slightly different culture but that is sort of still there in the back of your mind.
>> So in college I thought yeah like these two things I should just stay away from boys.
>> I mean you're mentioning the the insecurity and you share a bit about a bit about that
>> in the book and there is one quote that really struck me. You were talking about sort of grappling with self-image and you said, "My face and body were now meant for service, not romance. You don't need to be attractive to be an activist." I told myself
>> I was struck by that. I mean, unpack that quote for me. What did that mean? You didn't have to be attractive to be an activist. So, it wasn't on your mind. I thought um that activism was now the mission of my life
>> and I did not have to think about looking pretty for that.
>> On the other hand, I thought that to have love in your life, you needed to be looking all perfect and needed the facial symmetry. And so, yeah, I thought, okay, like I can't have all of that, but at least I can do my activism. M
>> did you think you'd ever be in a relationship? Like was that something that
>> No.
>> No. Really?
>> I never thought that. No.
>> And how and how did that make you feel when you were to to contemplate a life and and truly I say with without any kind of veilance, positive or negative? Like how did that make you feel to contemplate a life without a romantic relationship?
>> My life changed completely when I was in love with a person. I could not fix my my thinking. You know, before that I was a strong advocate against marriages. I had told all of my college friends that do not get married or like at least I'm not getting married. These boys are just a waste of time.
>> I was so against the institution of marriage in itself. I was questioning it because growing up I had seen how girls were forced into marriage or they were married off when they were still children and that is still a reality for many girls. So I thought why would even I consider it. I'm an advocate for girls's rights. You know this is the last thing I'll think about.
>> Yeah.
>> And here I was in love with a guy and I knew that culturally for me to be with this guy I need to be married to him because in our culture like I cannot just live with a guy. My parents will never allow that. Um it's hard to explain the cultural part because you know it becomes a controversy and there's a lot of backlash if you do not follow the traditions and the tradition is that
>> you have to like marry and it's usually your parents agreeing and and all of that. You cannot technically be dating or be in love.
>> I was you know happy that my parents sort of were were okay with me like seeing the guy but my mom put so many restrictions. She told me and this is before co that you have to be 6 feet apart. So, she kind of started that trend. It sounds like
>> she started that before we had those germs.
>> Looking at a future.
>> Yeah.
>> Without a romantic relationship, did it make you feel I don't know.
>> It It made life easier for me.
>> Huh. That's okay.
>> I thought life would be so easy if there were no relationships, no love life to think about, and no marriage and all of that and kids and like
>> family stuff. I said, "Hey, stay away from all of that.
>> Work, work, and work." Yeah.
>> And I will be honest that becoming an activist at a young age and not knowing so much about what the lives of activists from history have been really like. So in my head
>> like I thought like Martin Luther King Jr. or Mother Teresa or Dalai Lama Nelson Mandela all had these lives which were all about work even though they had like wives and like you know kids and all of that. There's this like perception that you have that life all has to be about work. It can never be about you about your love and these are all sacrifices and compromises you have to make.
>> But when I fell in love now let's bring this man on stage. Tell me about the guy you fell in love with.
>> So I met Assur at university. He was visiting a friend who was studying there. And the moment I saw him, I knew that he was my type. He was tall, handsome, with trimmed beard and just wide shoulders. And I thought, "Oh my god." Like I had pictured this guy in my imagination and somehow I see him in reality. There is this 3D print of him.
>> You are making me jealous, girl.
>> Yeah. With a cute smile. And he was just laughing the whole time. And he was funny. and he was cracking jokes and laughing at my jokes and I was like, "Wow, he is the one."
>> Well, that's the dream, isn't it?
>> Yeah. But if you ask him, like the story that he has starts at like a different point and I'm like, "Ugh, let's not even talk about it."
>> Talking about it. Let's just say you had wide shoulders and you were tall.
>> I was like, "Can you just simply say, yeah, like I fell in love with you the moment I saw you." He's like, "No, I have to be truthful." I was like, "No, not not all the time." But then he reminds me he says you have to remember that like you were Malala to me and sometimes he says this joke that my right shoulder was telling me that there's one person in the world that you don't want to offend or break the heart of it's Malala. And then my left shoulder was telling me that if you break Malala's heart you are going to be her enemy number one and you do not want that life. So,
>> so basically both both angels and devils were telling him like do not f this up. Basically,
>> he was like I was just so scared. He said he said like do you think like somebody meets Malala and immediately would say
>> yeah I want her to be my girlfriend or like I want to marry her. He said like no. He's like of course like you are so fun and like I was so happy that you know we were becoming friends
>> but
>> I could not imagine it and I was like okay fine fine you can get away with it. One story I remember which is really funny. When uh we were still like getting to know each other, I took him to see this movie.
>> Mhm.
>> Which was Toy Story 4.
>> Okay. Yeah.
>> And I was like, you know, a bit flirty and all of that. And I was like, why is this guy like so nervous and like sort of like tight and just like
>> why can't he just he why can't he just relax? And I asked him and he's like, you know, you have like security and they're standing right behind me.
>> He's like, uh, maybe those two massive guys
>> and you want me to be like relaxed and all of that. So later on I understood. I was like, oh yeah, poor thing. I never thought about it from his perspective.
>> So you're like, loosen up. He's like, you know, just watching a movie. Enjoy. Have fun. Be yourself.
>> I didn't even know they had Toy Story 4.
>> Yeah. Yeah. H how did he make you feel like as you hung out with him more and more as you talked as you got to know him as a person not just a hottie like how did Yeah. How did he make you feel?
>> Whenever I was with him I felt that I was loved and he made me feel like the present me it's you know like when you meet people they have this fixed image of you
>> and they feel like they know who you are.
>> Well I will say you more so than someone else of course. Absolutely.
>> But for him, it was it was just this with him, I felt like I could grow as a person.
>> Huh.
>> Yeah. I like what you're saying like as opposed to like a a fixed idea of who you were, this vaunted, brave, you know, active. It was like you felt
>> things felt um like they could change, like they could mold, like they could grow, like they were flexible almost. Yes. And when I think about a life partner, this is the person you want with whom you can grow,
>> right?
>> You will never be the same person as you are in this moment. He will also not be the same person as he is in that moment.
>> And when you start your life together, you can grow together. I immediately felt that with Assur that he is so adventurous. He likes trying new things. He's funny. Life just looks more fun with him. And I was imagining a life with him and I thought, "Wow, like it just looks so good." So I was very happy like that I was, you know, technically dating him and that I was seeing him.
>> But at the same time, I was reminding myself that no, I'm supposed to be an activist and I can't get married and this is all a distraction and
>> right
>> then um
>> and you were so staunchly opposed, you know, you're right. You were so opposed to marriage as an institution.
>> Yes. because of what it represented, you know, the patriarchy. You didn't want to be controlled.
>> Yeah. How did you reckon with those things? What a bummer to really like this guy and be like, "This could be serious, but also I've I'm staunchly opposed to marriage."
>> Like, I would be honest that I liked Assur and everything was going well. I was also scared if Assur would be the same person as he is now. And I had heard so many stories of girls who
>> find out that the husband is not the guy who they thought would be after they get married.
>> After they get married and things change or then they have these expectations from each other like the husband is expecting the wife to do certain things or like do chores or change her career path and all of that. And I knew like this was never going to happen. And I knew that I knew about my rights and like I am an activist for girls everywhere. I can fight for myself. But it was it just felt like I you know I could not I just did not want it to be a situation where now suddenly I was like getting married and this guy was like you know I was like I I have to fix another guy and I have to fix another problem while I'm advocating for so many other things.
>> I did not want it to be like another journey of activism for me. I was like if marriage makes life easier and happier then I should consider it.
>> Yeah.
>> In the end we spent some time together in Lake Placid in the US and this was the first time when it was just the two of us and we had the best time together and I had prepared a whole list of questions because I thought I'll ask him everything and figure out who he truly is. And you know like I was like I just want to know everything about this guy. What is inside his mind? like what he's showing what what I see right now is all good. It's like 10 out of 10. But
>> is there something mysterious in his mind that I need to know?
>> You know, it's like
>> I know seriously I should change my job.
>> Come and work for
>> and I realized that the person is who I realized that he was this person the whole time that I that that I saw him. It's like you you keep looking, you keep peeling it off and it's like a layer after a layer, but it's still the same thing.
>> Yeah. Was there a moment where you realize that like Yeah. that he was who he said he was? Was there I don't know. You look at him at breakfast and like the lights hitting him and you're like that's it, you know, that's him. Like was there a moment?
>> I still feel that
>> when he is kind to somebody, when he cares about his family members and friends, he shows up. He checks on people. He looks after me. He's just so nice to me. I can't tell you. He can listen to me rambling at midnight when he's so tired and exhausted.
>> The yap does turn on at midnight. Huh.
>> And yeah, that's a thing. And he, you know, can he cares about like what I eat and if I'm busy with my work, he makes sure that I have some fun time. So he would arrange uh sports in the middle of it to say you need to relax, you need to take some time off. So like my life is sort of still the same, but I feel happier uh that he's with me now.
>> In this moment in Lake Placid, which is fun that it was there. It's such a it's cool that Yeah. Um you realize that you're ready to marry. What was it about that trip that changed your mind? Was it your mind changed about him or your mind changed about the institution of marriage or both or neither? Like what shifted?
>> Oh, definitely not about the institution of marriage at all. That is easy to answer. We have to question marriage. We have to make this an open conversation because it is still affecting the lives of tens of millions of girls every year. And even in places where women have more equal rights and even in developed countries, marriage still means more compromises for women.
>> So I think that's a whole separate conversation and I don't have all the answers but I think it's important for us to to doubt it to question it. In Lake Placid, I was sure about getting married to Assur uh was because I knew he was the right guy. He seemed to be this kind, sweet, and the best guy had ever seen. He like I had the best time with him and I loved him for sure. But I started loving myself as well. And that's the difference he made in my life that I felt that I should love myself and I should be okay accepting that he loves me too. And I realized I don't have to ask him every question about so what do you think about you know four marriages in Islam or what do you think about a woman earning more than the man? And he was like yeah if he if she earns more that's fine. Like he's like I'll be a heavier man. He's like, "Oh, you just get it right every time."
>> It is so interesting. It's like this list of you tried to sort of itemize all of the things that could go wrong, right?
>> And it's very beautiful to me that at the end of this trip, you you realized you just you didn't have to do that.
>> Yes. He was quite surprised. He was like, "So, where are the questions? Like, when are you going to ask ripped paper?" Yeah.
>> I was like, "You know, I know." because you knew the answer was
>> yes
>> was what it's not even it's not even about the answers to those questions the answer is he loves you right
>> and I love myself
>> yes
>> you know we talked about how your feelings about marriage as an institution
>> yeah h
>> haven't changed you're still committed to to doing to advocating for women's independence and and right to choose decide whether they want to get married and I guess I I wondered now you are a wife, right? Like has that ch what does that mean to you? Like how are you able to Yeah. What does that mean to you?
>> You know those words still sound quite heavy.
>> Wife and husband.
>> Do you use different words?
>> Yeah. Bestie.
>> You use bestie.
>> Oh, I love that. Yeah.
>> It's We don't call each other husband and wife. It's when people ask us or when people bring it up, that's when we're like, "Oh, so we are husband and wife." Okay.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Does it feel so that doesn't that word doesn't feel like it fits so much?
>> I have a very stereotypical idea of what a wife means and I hated the word. Yeah.
>> Genuinely hated the word
>> growing up. I thought like gh you want to be a wife come on. And husband I was like you know just because you grow grow up with it. You cannot suddenly take it away from yourself. And you know, I I just thought that was not a cool thing to be a wife.
>> Yeah. Do you feel married? I guess that's really the question I want to ask. Like, do you feel married? Yeah.
>> It's about redefining what marriage is. M
>> I know that a lot of people uh will be already embracing it in this new way where it means equal partnership between two people where they respect each other and they love each other and they make lives easier for each other. They make lives more fun for each other. M
>> but where I come from and what I have experienced seeing things like child marriages and just how women's futures change completely with marriage. I cannot fully take it away from me that I still have that traditional idea of it and that just causes that trigger for me and I sometimes think that am I giving up to the old systems but I know it it is it is different it is different when you are in a new country it's different when you are
>> redefining it it's different when the partner actually has you know good values and has you know a common understanding of respects, you know,
>> and respects you and and he's like, "Yeah, marriage, whatever. I just want to be with you." Like, that's the most important thing for him. So, that changes everything. I'm like, "Yeah, sure. Let's call it marriage. Let's call it whatever we want to call it. Uh, it's about us sharing this journey of life ahead together."
>> I want to turn back to your book. You know, I'm struck that the title Finding My Way is it's an active title. It's not I found my way. No,
>> it's finding, right? You're in the process of and I guess I Yeah, I wonder like what do you feel like you're still figuring out about yourself? Actually, um wanted a title like finding my way because I do not feel comfortable with books that feel like they have cracked the code and figured it all out. That if you read this book, you have no worries in life anymore. That's just not the reality.
>> Finding my way is a true reflection of what the journey is actually like where things are happening for the first time. You may not have even planned them to be a part of your life. You are having these experiences in college like Bong
>> like bong.
>> Or you are climbing rooftops like that was never part of my plan. Getting ghosted by my crush that was never part of my plan. nearly failing my exams. That wasn't part of my plan, right?
>> These things happen. You meet the love of your life at a time when you were like, "Wait a second. I'm sort of still in university. I wish this like I wish I was not thinking about marriage and all of these things right now." Um or like you know you are recovering from the last uh you are recovering from the bullet of the Taliban and having your last surgery and the Taliban take control of Afghanistan and you have to think about evacuating the people who you are supporting and at the same time thinking about the future of women and girls and what does that mean for you like all of these things is about finding your way. You do not have the answer immediately, but it is embracing those moments and accepting the emotions and the feelings you're going through. You cannot make them disappear. Asking for help when you need to. Talking to your friends and family, your colleagues, and knowing that together you will be able to make a way through it. You will find your way through it.
>> You're 28 right now.
>> Yes.
>> Yeah. What would what would you say to to 15-year-old Malala.
>> Oh, I might give her my book. Girl, read this book. There is so much ahead of you.
>> There's so much ahead of you. Do not get distracted by what people around you are telling you, who you are supposed to be, what media outlet wants to speak to you, and how you need to go and give a speech at this conference and that event. Follow your heart. Make friends. Be cheeky sometimes. It's okay if you don't know all the answers. It's okay if you get scared. That's all fine. You will find your way through it.
>> Malala, thank you so much. What a pleasure to have this conversation.
>> Thank you. So nice speaking to you as well.
