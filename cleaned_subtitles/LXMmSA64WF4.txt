Recently, there has been frequent online discussion about the mental exhaustion of modern people.
Different schools of psychology have different coping methods.
The book I'm going to introduce today
It's the bestselling book in Japan, "The Practice of Non-Reaction," with 300,000 copies sold.
The author of this book, Kusanagi Ryushun, was a Buddhist monk.
Known as a "famous monk of Tokyo University"
In this book, he advocates using the wisdom of early Buddhism from 2500 years ago.
Solving the troubles of modern people
If we carefully read the scriptures of early Buddhism
You'll find that it's actually a very rational way of thinking.
It can teach us how to get rid of internal conflicts in life.
Let's take a look now.
What exactly is non-reactive practice?
When we have troubles
This usually generates antagonistic emotions.
You might want to fight against someone you don't like, or against a reality you don't like.
However, the author asks us to reflect on our own experiences.
When you overreact to something and develop an adversarial mindset
What were the results?
Does it often make you more frustrated?
There are very few experiences in life where one truly wins through confrontation.
So the author wants us to take a step back first.
Don't rush to react to something.
The psychology of reacting unconsciously
In Buddhism, this is called "ignorance" (无明).
It means the state of being invisible.
It's because you haven't seen the truth of the matter yet.
It just happened unconsciously.
The author believes
All of a person's troubles stem from unnecessary reactions.
Therefore, the first step in non-reaction practice is...
Don't react to something immediately.
There's no need to try to get rid of troubles.
Instead, try to understand the real reason for your troubles.
Only by finding the cause can we know how to deal with it.
Simply understanding the reasons is already the first step.
Many people get stuck in distress.
It's all because they don't realize the root cause of their suffering.
For example, before the Buddha himself attained enlightenment...
Also a person full of worries every day
He was a descendant of royalty
Life is very luxurious
Logically speaking, there shouldn't be any trouble.
But the thought that people will eventually grow old and die...
It makes one lament that all the pleasures of youth are ultimately meaningless.
Because no matter how much you get
How much wealth and fame have been accumulated?
In the end, everything will be lost.
Under this pessimistic mindset
He began to explore new lifestyles
He decided to become a monk at the age of 26.
He said
I became a monk in pursuit of goodness.
Goodness refers to a state of mind that pursues clarity and brightness.
In other words, we need to know the root cause of human suffering.
Only then can people's freedom be restored.
It is recorded in the Vinaya Pitaka.
The Buddha believed that humans suffer from eight great sufferings.
Birth, old age, sickness, and death are the four great sufferings.
The other four are
Encountering everything you hate
Separation from everything you love
Desires that cannot be fulfilled
There are also too many desires and the burning of the five aggregates.
It can also cause pain
After understanding what kind of suffering I was experiencing
We can then ask further questions
What causes this suffering?
Buddhism believes
The root of many human sufferings
They are all a kind of pursuit.
The pursuit of desires branches into seven kinds of desires.
The desire for survival, the desire for sleep, greed, sexual desire, laziness, pleasure, and identity.
Humans react only when stimulated by certain desires.
So when you feel dissatisfied in the future
Why not ask yourself?
What kind of desire is stimulating you now?
What troubles modern people the most
It's probably the desire for recognition.
This is also a major difference between humans and animals.
As children, people crave recognition from their parents and siblings.
As adults, we crave recognition from school teachers and peers.
As adults, we crave recognition from colleagues and superiors.
If you don't get this recognition, you'll feel frustrated.
The root of this sense of frustration
It is the desire for recognition.
I hope to receive more affirmation and more love.
Many people might ask in return
What's wrong with this kind of desire?
The Buddha did not actually ask people to deny the existence of desire.
On the contrary
It means accepting the fact that humans are beings of desire.
So when these thoughts arise
You can then have a self-aware voice telling you...
I now crave the affirmation of others.
It is my inner strength that is in control of me.
Just to reach this understanding
It can allow people to enter another realm.
You will begin to explore your inner self.
Why do I so desperately crave someone's approval?
The author then told a story
An 80-year-old woman came to this monk seeking enlightenment.
She lived with her eldest son, but was subjected to domestic violence by him.
Finally became a vagrant
I don't know why I've ended up like this.
She told the monk
If I don't get an answer, I'll commit suicide today.
The monk then began to listen to the woman recount her past.
It turns out she has seven brothers and sisters.
Moreover, she was the only one who had not received an education.
I have been taking care of my mother at home since I was a child.
After this woman got married and had children
The mother took the child to be raised again.
This makes the child feel that he is not close to the woman.
The woman asked the monk
Can I overcome this kind of life?
The monk told her
sure
What should we do?
To understand correctly
I understand that I've been thinking about my relationship with my mother.
Many dissatisfactions and pains in life
It all stemmed from this relationship.
But I couldn't detach myself from this and see it.
Discovering that one's suffering stems from this.
This made the woman feel reborn.
Therefore, many people who are often troubled
Perhaps they are all people who cannot see themselves.
Unable to see one's own pain
It originated from which relationship?
The author provides a three-step approach to non-reaction practice here.
The principle is to understand, not react.
The first step is to cultivate the habit of observing one's inner state.
And confirm with words
Tell yourself what kind of emotion you are currently experiencing.
Allowing the flowing emotions to be named
This is equivalent to shifting the focus from the external world to the internal world.
It helps restore inner peace.
The second step is to experience the sensations in your body.
For example, pay attention to the contraction of your abdomen while breathing.
Focus your mind on your body
Instead of in thoughts
This is actually the same principle as mindfulness meditation.
The third step is to categorize in your mind.
Clarify whether you are driven by desire, anger, or delusion.
If your mind keeps wandering...
It's hard to break free.
The author suggests that such people close their eyes first.
When everything was pitch black
Allow yourself to let your mind wander.
Then I opened my eyes and saw the world before me.
Tell yourself this is reality.
This allows you to shift your focus between darkness and reality.
Able to better identify when one is delusional
Another reason for many of life's troubles is unnecessary judgment.
People always like to judge which is better or more valuable.
However, the results of the comparison
There will inevitably be one side that is worse.
The weaker party will feel useless.
Therefore, many of our troubles stem from this kind of comparative judgment.
Some people even like to make judgments before things even happen.
They said it was definitely impossible to succeed or to do it well.
Prematurely criticizing oneself before even doing anything.
This is also a form of overjudgment.
But why do people like to make judgments so much?
Because judgment can bring a certain sense of pleasure.
It seems like I know a lot about this.
You can spout nonsense.
From an evolutionary perspective
If our ancient human ancestors were to survive
It is essential to make the right judgment when gathering food.
Knowing which foods are good and can be eaten.
Which foods are rotten or harmful?
Therefore, we keep making judgments.
It may be a survival instinct etched into human genes.
Making judgments can also satisfy people's desire for recognition.
For example, we might complain to our friends.
This is clearly someone else's fault.
At this point, your friends will agree with your judgment.
I'll curse along with you
Over-judgment makes others feel that they are always right.
To gain satisfaction from this
However, this habit is precisely the root of the trouble.
Non-response exercises require us to distinguish between judgments and facts.
For example, a mother once came to see this monk.
What should I do if my daughter doesn't like to study?
How can I help her get into a prestigious university?
It was only after a detailed conversation that we discovered...
It turns out that what the mother truly cared about was not her daughter's future.
It's because he failed the exam before.
And resentment and unwillingness arose in their hearts.
He wanted to make up for himself through his daughter's life.
For such a mother
The monk did not immediately determine that she was wrong.
Instead, find out the reason.
Thinking about how to alleviate her pain
This mother herself did not get into a prestigious university.
This is a fact.
However, because he failed the exam...
I feel worthless
This is a subjective judgment.
It also affected her relationship with her daughter.
This caused both herself and her daughter to suffer.
This mother was actually a victim of judgment.
He didn't realize it himself.
The root of the mother's suffering lay in her unwavering belief in this judgment.
Clinging to an unfulfilled wish from the past
My whole life revolves around this sense of failure
The result is that I suffer.
It also caused pain to those around them.
This is the true state of affairs.
Many times we think reality is
I am pursuing a certain wish.
But the reality is...
I am causing suffering to those around me.
This is called "inversion" in Buddhism.
Many sufferings in the human world
It all stems from this inversion.
Because people need to be able to make judgments in order to survive in society.
But on the other hand
Excessive judgment and attachment will lead to suffering.
The Buddhist method is...
It's best not to judge yourself or others.
Regardless of what judgment others make
No reaction needed
Just take it easy.
For example, the *Jingji* records:
Don't assume you're superior.
Not as good as others
No distinction between superior and inferior
Even hearing various sounds
Don't judge your own worth.
The Buddha had a very interesting saying
The moment you judge me to be right
You have made the wrong judgment.
Because all human judgment is merely a blind man's illusion.
Seeing only a part of the truth
Unless you are a god, you cannot see the whole picture.
People who can understand this
They wouldn't think their judgment was correct.
No one has the right to judge whether another person is good or bad.
Those who judge others all day long
The real problem is that you can't see what you truly want.
Therefore, one needs to constantly evaluate others to gain a sense of presence.
How then can we practice non-judgment and non-response exercises?
The author provides us with three steps.
First
First, you need to be self-aware and make a judgment.
Whenever a thought flashes through my mind
Or find yourself judging others
Be alert immediately
Ah, I've made another judgment.
Go away
Or
Get rid of you as usual
Like this
The second step is to discard the judgment.
When someone criticizes something
Don't be swayed by public opinion and join the condemnation.
Instead, it's about refusing to make judgments.
Others are others, and I am me.
I maintain my independence and autonomy
The third step is to observe the trends.
Observe yourself
When you make many self-righteous judgments
What you get is just a little bit of self-satisfaction.
It won't actually make you live a happy life.
Therefore, the Buddhist attitude is...
One must be honest with oneself.
Observe yourself when making judgments
Is it just about satisfying one's own self-righteous vanity?
However, there is another type of person who does not make arrogant judgments.
Instead, it's self-denial.
The author believes that people who habitually deny themselves...
It's actually expressing aggression.
And the person being attacked is yourself.
From a Buddhist perspective
The problem here is
You have generated some anger.
So how do we stop this kind of judgment?
When self-doubting thoughts arise in your mind
Go for a walk outdoors
Shift your attention to bodily sensations
Observe the surrounding environment
That is, to step out of your inner closed-off self.
For example, the Japanese Tendai sect has a tradition called "Thousand-Day Return to the Peak".
It took seven years
Walk 30 to 80 kilometers every day
The purpose of walking these paths is a form of spiritual practice.
To eliminate self-denying judgments
When you shift your attention away from those who criticize you
Turn to others
You'll discover that the outside world is vast.
The only people who disagree with you are a minority.
Most people are actually very busy with their lives.
There's no time to negate others.
But you are influenced by the opinions of a minority.
Let yourself be annoyed all day
This is actually very irrational.
Buddhism teaches us to be more rational.
Stop judging
But this doesn't mean everyone has to be very confident.
Because confidence is also an irrational idea.
This indicates that you believe you can do it.
But is it possible to do it?
You only know after you do it.
No one can predict the outcome.
Therefore, I am very confident that I can do it.
It's actually a kind of self-deceptive judgment.
It's an illusion
Buddhism's attitude is
Just focus on doing the things at hand.
What was the outcome?
No need to make a judgment
Therefore, non-reaction practice
It is to tell us
When you encounter other people's judgments in the future
No need to make a judgment along with it
As long as the judgment stops.
Life is half peaceful
We often hear the saying that
All the troubles
They all stem from interpersonal relationships.
This statement
This is incorrect from a Buddhist perspective.
Because interpersonal relationships refer to how to get along with others.
But the troubles stem from one's own emotions.
These are two different things.
They should be viewed separately.
In fact
Even a very bad interpersonal relationship
It doesn't necessarily cause trouble.
The author then told a story
As the Buddha's reputation in ancient India grew...
Many Brahmin priests wished to become his disciples.
However, the Buddha's status was that of a Kshatriya.
That is, a class lower than Brahmins.
So this was a big deal at the time.
At that time there was a Brahmin
They went to the scene and insulted the Buddha.
The Buddha answered him
Brahmin, if you hold a feast in your house, but the guests do not eat...
Whose food is this?
The Brahmin said: Of course it's mine.
So how would you prepare this food?
The Brahmin said
I'll eat it myself.
The Buddha then replied
If someone insults me
I then started cursing back.
It's like someone else treated me to food.
I just ate along with them
But I don't accept the food you give me.
Your words belong to you.
Take it back.
The Buddha used food as a metaphor in his teachings.
If you refuse the other person's food
Others will have to eat it themselves.
The same
When the other party said a lot of negative things
It's like producing a pile of poop.
We don't need to eat it.
We can choose not to react.
Please ask the other party to take it back themselves.
This is the way to avoid being troubled by interpersonal relationships.
Push the other person's reaction back
The author suggests we can do this non-reaction exercise.
Be mindful of whether you are emotionally aroused by the other person's reaction.
It's normal to have emotional reactions.
The important thing is to practice discovering the existence of this thing.
And prevent unnecessary reactions.
Cultivate a state of mind that remains unmoved.
Do not react.
To understand why the other person is experiencing such negative emotions, you must first understand why they are having these feelings.
Try your best to understand the other person
This does not mean unconditional tolerance.
Instead, we should use reason to overcome the psychological urge to react.
Rather than judging the other person as stupid
Instead, try to understand why the other person did what they did.
Buddhism seeks precisely this level of understanding.
It's not just about not reacting to others.
Don't react to the past.
Many people are nostalgic for memories of the past.
For example, having an argument with someone
Even after it ended, I was still angry about it and it lingered in my mind until the next day.
At this point, what bothers you is no longer the other person.
Rather, it is your own memory.
You are reacting emotionally to past memories.
Therefore, the author wants us to observe our own emotions.
What exactly is it that is reacting to?
It is the people and things on site
Memories of the past
If it happened in the past
Don't bring them into the future.
Instead, you should always treat the other person as a new person.
Because people change.
The person I met yesterday
He could become a completely different person in a single day.
We're just judging each other based on past memories.
And forget that others are constantly changing into new people.
Some people might say that this is difficult to do.
I still care a lot about what others think.
It is easy to cause internal friction.
The author suggests that whenever your mind starts to wander...
When you want to have a reaction
Turn your attention to your body
Like when a child is crying
Just show them something interesting.
Their attention immediately shifted.
Forgot that you were crying
The same
Even adults
I am often troubled by things that I can't shake off.
Like a crying child who can't stop.
The best method at this time
It's about shifting your attention to your body.
For example, going for a walk outdoors.
Or go take a shower
If none of the above methods work
The author suggests
The source of the reaction should be temporarily cut off.
For example, some people are very natural in their interactions with others.
But as soon as I got home
It's so annoying to be around my parents and family.
If you overreact
It always points to a certain person or a certain source.
So keep your distance from these sources of trouble.
That would be the wise move.
People in today's society
There is another source of suffering
It's about competition.
We no longer compete to meet basic needs.
Rather, it was to satisfy some unnecessary goals.
Education, experience, appearance, attire, and page views
Many people would say that competition is inherent in human nature.
Like children who can grab toys and play without even learning how.
Adults compete for performance and market share at work.
It's also normal human nature.
But this argument overlooks one thing.
In fact, many competitions in society
It's essentially a virtual competition created by humans.
For example, pursuing education is a good example.
Children start to care a lot about grades when they get to middle school.
But what they actually care about is not the results themselves.
It's not academic knowledge.
Rather, it's the class ranking.
This ranking was created by the school.
Intentionally provoking the child by asking what rank they got.
That is, society uses a set of standards from childhood.
To help children affirm their own value
If you want to be recognized, you must get high scores.
But this is a virtual competition.
It just puts the child in a daze.
Thinking that getting a high score equates to being a winner in life
This kind of virtual competition is precisely what adults create.
Parents to satisfy their vanity
I would also be very pleased to see this system continue.
This way, you can tell your family and friends how well your child did on the exam.
This kind of virtual competition has a profound impact on people.
Many people have been in the workforce for several years.
Still bragging about which school he graduated from.
But what is the purpose of society designing these virtual competitions?
To put it bluntly, it's about making yourself feel superior to others.
However, from a Buddhist perspective...
This is very irrational.
Because you feel better.
That doesn't mean you're actually better.
I feel inferior to others
It doesn't mean you're actually worse.
Like many people who get into National Taiwan University
They are not necessarily more knowledgeable than people from other schools.
Or capitalists who win in market competition
They already have a lot of wealth.
But as long as the competition continues
You'll feel like you still don't have enough assets.
So they compared and contrasted over there.
It only adds to your own troubles.
However, Buddhism does not deny that reality is full of competition.
Instead, it should point out the true nature of this competition.
It's virtual, artificial, and irrational.
This is how we learn to face [the situation].
Faced with competition, it seems we only have two choices.
Either join or strive to become a winner.
Because nobody wants to be a loser.
Otherwise, one can choose to quit and become a monk.
Away from the hustle and bustle of the world
However, the author believes there is actually a third option.
It's about surviving in competition with different motivations.
It's not about seeking victory or winning over others.
Instead, they seek survival with other values.
How can we break free from the illusion of pursuing victory?
Let's consider all the possible scenarios.
If the competition is lost
You will want to bounce back and pursue victory.
But if we win
You won't give up.
You will still want to win more victories.
Or after the event has passed
You might continue thinking
If we had done that back then
He's already living a victorious life.
There is another type of person who will keep thinking
My life is a complete failure.
It's actually just a deep-seated desire for success.
That's why you feel this sense of frustration.
So regardless of the outcome
You still won't be satisfied.
This method of Buddhism
Please rationally list out every possible outcome.
You will find
No matter which road you take
They all lead themselves down a path of suffering.
Buddhism aims to liberate people from this suffering.
This doesn't mean that people don't need to work or put in any effort.
Instead, we need to think.
How to survive while
Don't let yourself suffer from competition
The author gave an example.
A man
Working at a murderous consulting firm
Colleagues fighting each other and sabotaging each other
After the man told the monk
The monk then answered him
These people are all bound by desires.
You should look at them with compassion.
These people are trying to survive in the workplace
Kill each other to the death
In fact, they are a group of very suffering and pitiful people.
To understand this
On the contrary, it will affect people in society.
It evokes a sense of compassion and pity.
This is the goal of non-reactive mindfulness.
Don't get caught up in virtual competition.
Instead, we should take a step back.
Seeing this competition
How many innocent victims?
Hold a compassionate heart
Instead of competing with everyone else
Because the fundamental understanding of Buddhism is...
There is no such thing as winning or losing between people.
These are all fantasies created by virtual competition.
In today's video, we introduced the "non-reaction exercise" that has become a sensation in Japan.
Starting from the psychology of early Buddhism
It teaches us how to understand, not react.
Understanding one's many pains
They are all born out of desire.
And also accept that humans are beings of desire.
Through this set of non-reactive mindfulness practices
Reduce your judgment
Regardless of what judgment others make
No reaction needed
Don't overreact because you can't forget the past.
In this way
Even a very bad interpersonal relationship
It doesn't necessarily cause you trouble.
This can eliminate the root causes of these internal conflicts.
at last
The non-reaction exercise also teaches us
Seeing through all kinds of virtual competition in the world
Wake yourself from the delusion of pursuing victory.
You can live more freely and in a more Zen-like way.
If you want to know more about the philosophy of avoiding internal conflict
